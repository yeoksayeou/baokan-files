    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: The fascist rule of the Indonesian right-wing military regime has seriously undermined the country's industrial and agricultural production, leading to a worsening financial and economic situation and increasingly miserable lives for the broad masses of working people.
    According to a recent report in Jakarta's *Angkatan Bersenjata* (Armed Forces Daily), on May 6, Deputy Prime Minister Hamengkubuwono of the Indonesian right-wing military regime admitted at a plenary session of the Mutual Cooperation Parliament that the regime is currently facing "rampant inflation" and "general price hikes." He said: "The rapid rise in prices has disrupted many economic and construction projects, even preventing the government itself from carrying out its work according to the expenditure budget that should be determined annually. As a result, not only is the government's administrative work hindered and facing difficulties, but rampant inflation makes it impossible for many private and government construction projects to proceed."
    Buwono also admitted that the right-wing military regime is facing difficulties with dwindling gold reserves and declining foreign exchange income and reserves. He said: "Since October 1965, the position of cash exchange for foreign currency has become so poor that we cannot amortize the principal and interest of foreign loans that have matured."
    Since October 1, the right-wing reactionary forces have created a fascist white terror throughout the country, both in urban and rural areas, engaging in murder, arson, and all kinds of evil deeds, seriously damaging industrial and agricultural production and transportation. Consequently, the shortage of industrial and agricultural products and the extreme scarcity of food have become one of the biggest problems currently facing the Indonesian right-wing military regime.
    According to *Berita Yudha* (Combat News) on May 6, Indonesian "government leaders describe the economic and social situation as 'extremely serious'." The news stated that in Jakarta, "the inventory in various stores is decreasing, and some counters in these stores that usually display textiles are mostly empty."
    *Sinar Harapan* (Ray of Hope) reported on the 12th: "The Jakarta commercial market has fluctuated in the past forty-eight hours, and the prices of foreign goods have risen. The prices of various fine and coarse textiles have increased by almost an average of fifty to seventy-five percent. The prices of daily necessities, including canned foods, have also increased."
    Soaring prices severely threaten even government civil servants. Deputy Prime Minister Hamengkubuwono admitted in a recent speech to the Mutual Cooperation Parliament that the wages of Indonesian civil servants "are not enough to cover a week's living expenses."
    It is reported that due to declining foreign exchange reserves, the industrial raw materials and equipment that have always relied on foreign imports are also not being supplied, leading to the large-scale closure of factories, with the general operating rate of industry only reaching about 20 percent.
    According to a recent report in Jakarta's *Ampera Review*, the right-wing military regime has formulated a huge deficit budget for 1966. The report stated that this "latest draft fiscal budget shows that the national income for 1966 is only 5 billion New Rupiahs, while expenditures will reach 20 billion New Rupiahs, resulting in a deficit of 15 billion New Rupiahs." The newspaper worriedly said that this huge deficit would lead to "increasingly severe" inflation in 1966. To make up for the deficit, the right-wing military regime plans to increase the amount of currency issued this year by more than ten times that of last year.
    The Japanese magazine *Sekai Shuho* (World Weekly) published an article on April 26 titled "The Masses Gasping Under Inflation," depicting the dire circumstances in which the broad masses of working people in Indonesia have been plunged by the misdeeds of the right-wing military regime.
    The article said: "In Jakarta, what attracts the most attention from observers is the long queue in front of the state-run pawnshop. Most of those lining up are housewives. They all look worried. I approached the pawnshop window and saw that most of the items being pawned were clothes. Many people may no longer have anything else, so they even pawn their pots and pans. Clothes can generally be pawned for seven or eight rupiahs, which can only buy two kilograms of rice. According to the housewives, apart from a few big shots, very few families can make a living solely on the legitimate income of their husbands. Now, in general, adults can only eat cassava and taro, and children can only eat porridge made from bran flour. Many families cannot afford the cost of their children's ordinary education."
    The article continued: The poor people in the harbor area "universally harbor discontent with the government. After the coup, despite the military's repeated vigorous propaganda of 'military and civilians as one, soldiers and farmers united', they have painful experiences and express considerable doubt and aversion to this."
    The article also said: "The peasants' lives are very hard. For example, in the rural areas around Yogyakarta, apart from the landlords and rich peasants who have surplus grain to sell on the black market, ordinary peasants do not even have enough to eat for themselves. Therefore, they have no choice but to mortgage their land to survive. Over time, many people sell all their land. This phenomenon is not limited to Yogyakarta alone. Farmers who have lost their land and become vagrants are all running to the cities. According to the Indonesian authorities, there are 10,000 (Editor's note: The Japanese newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* says there are 100,000) in Jakarta alone; in the center of Semarang, I also saw people sleeping in the square; and I also encountered many ragged farmers in the rural areas of Central Java, supporting the old and carrying the young, wandering around begging for food."
    The article concluded: "In short, in every corner, the people are gasping under inflation."

    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权的法西斯统治，严重地破坏了这个国家的工农业生产，使印度尼西亚的财政经济状况越来越恶化，广大劳动人民的生活越来越悲惨。
    据雅加达《武装部队报》最近报道，印度尼西亚右派军人政权的副总理哈孟库·布沃诺五月六日在合作国会全体会议上就国内经济问题发表声明时承认，目前，印度尼西亚右派军人政权正面临着“猛烈的通货膨胀”和“物价的普遍飞涨”。他说：“物价上涨得这么快，打乱了许多经济事业计划和建设计划，甚至使政府本身也不能够按着那本来应该逐年确定的支出预算有计划地进行工作。结果，不但政府的行政工作受到阻滞并且遭到困难，猛烈的通货膨胀使很多私人和政府的建设项目无法进行。”
    布沃诺还承认右派军人政权也面临黄金储备减少和外汇的收入和储备减少的困难。他说：“自一九六五年十月以来，现金兑换外汇的地位变得这样恶劣，以致我们不可能分期摊还已到了偿还期的外国贷款的本息。”
    自去年十月一日以来，右派反动势力在全国城乡各地制造法西斯白色恐怖，到处杀人、放火、无恶不作，严重地破坏了工农业生产和交通运输，因此，工农业产品缺乏，粮食奇缺，成了印度尼西亚右派军人政权当前面临的最大难题之一。
    据《战斗报》五月六日透露，印度尼西亚“政府领导人把经济和社会形势描述成‘极其严重的形势’”。消息说，雅加达“各家商店的存货越来越少，在这些商店的一些通常摆纺织品的柜台，大部分已经空了”。
    《希望之光报》十二日说：“雅加达商场在最近四十八小时内发生波动，外国货价格上涨。各种精粗纺织品的价格几乎平均上涨了百分之五十到百分之七十五。日用百货包括罐头食品也涨了价。”
    物价飞涨，连政府公务员也遭到严重的威胁。副总理哈孟库·布沃诺最近在合作国会发表讲话时承认：印度尼西亚的公务员“一个月的工资不够一个星期的生活费”。
    据报道，由于外汇储备减少，一向仰赖国外进口的工业原料和器材也供应不上，工厂大批倒闭，工业一般开工率只达百分之二十左右。
    据雅加达《安佩拉评论报》最近报道，右派军人政权已经制定了庞大的一九六六年赤字预算。报道说，这个“最新的财政预算草案表明，一九六六年的国家收入只有五十亿新盾，而支出将达两百亿新盾，因此赤字将达一百五十亿新盾”。这家报纸忧心忡忡地说，这个庞大的赤字将使一九六六年的通货膨胀“日益加剧”。为了弥补赤字，右派军人政权计划在今年增发的货币通货量将达去年的十几倍。
    日本《世界周报》四月二十六日发表了题目是《群众在通货膨胀下喘息》的一篇文章，描绘了在右派军人政权的胡作非为下，印度尼西亚广大劳动人民陷入多么悲惨的境地。
    文章说：“在雅加达，最引起旁观者注目的，是在国营当铺门前排下的一列长蛇阵。排队者多半是家庭主妇。她们一个个愁眉不展。我靠近当铺窗口，看见拿去典当的东西，多半是衣服。很多人可能已经再也没有别的东西，以致把锅和盘子都拿去当了。衣服之类大体上能当七、八盾钱，只能买两公斤大米。据主妇们说，除了少数大人物，光靠丈夫的正当职业收入而能维持生活的家庭非常之少。现在一般家庭，大人只能吃木薯和芋头，孩子只好吃糠粉煮成的糊。很多家庭担负不起子弟的普通教育费用。”
    文章接着说：在港湾地区的贫民“普遍滋长着对政府的不满情绪。政变后，尽管军部一再大力宣传‘军民一体，兵农一致’，但他们有过痛苦的经验，对此颇表怀疑和厌恶。”
    文章还说：“农民生活很苦。例如，在日惹周围的农村，除了地主富农有余粮在黑市出售外，一般农民连自己吃的还不够，于是，不能不靠抵押土地度日，天长日久，很多人把土地都卖光了。这种现象还不仅限于日惹一地。失去土地变成流浪者的农民，都朝城市里跑，据印度尼西亚当局宣称，仅雅加达就有一万名（编者按：日本《朝日新闻》说有十万名）；在三宝垄市中心，我也看见有人在广场上露宿；我还在中爪哇农村碰到不少穿得破破烂烂的农民，扶老携幼，到处流浪乞食。”
    文章最后说：“总之，在各个角落，人民在通货膨胀下喘息。”
