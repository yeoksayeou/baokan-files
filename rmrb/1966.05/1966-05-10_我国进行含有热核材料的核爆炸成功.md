    China Successfully Conducts Nuclear Explosion Containing Thermonuclear Materials
    The CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission warmly congratulate the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who participated in the nuclear test and the personnel who contributed to the nuclear test.
    China conducts necessary and limited nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons to oppose the nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats of U.S. imperialism and its collaborators, and to oppose the U.S. and Soviet collusion to implement nuclear monopoly and undermine the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed people and oppressed nations.
    We solemnly declare once again that China will never, under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons. China will continue to work with all peace-loving people and countries in the world to strive for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Press Communique
    At 16:00 (Beijing time) on May 9, 1966, China successfully conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials in the airspace over its western region.
    This nuclear explosion test is a new and significant achievement made by the Chinese people in order to further strengthen national defense, safeguard the security of the motherland, and defend world peace.
    Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army, scientific and technological personnel, and the broad masses of workers have held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, given prominence to politics, adhered to the "Four Firsts," creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, implemented the policy of self-reliance and hard work formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, promoted the three-way combination of leadership, experts, and the masses, the three-way combination of education, research, and production, and the spirit of pooling wisdom and efforts and vigorously collaborating, ensuring the complete success of this nuclear test. This is a great victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction. This is a great victory for the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission extend warm congratulations to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army who participated in this nuclear test, and to the workers, engineering and technical personnel, scientific workers, and all relevant personnel who have contributed to China's nuclear tests, and hope that they will make persistent efforts and continuously achieve new achievements in the struggle to further strengthen China's national defense construction and realize the modernization of national defense.
    China conducts necessary and limited nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons to oppose the nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats of U.S. imperialism and its collaborators, and to oppose the U.S. and Soviet collusion to implement nuclear monopoly and undermine the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed people and oppressed nations. The Chinese people's mastery of nuclear weapons is a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are fighting heroically for liberation, and a new contribution to the defense of world peace.
    When China exploded its first and second atomic bombs, the Government of the People's Republic of China successively issued statements, clarifying China's fundamental position on nuclear weapons, and specifically proposed convening a summit conference of heads of state of all countries to discuss the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
    Since that time, disregarding the statements of the Chinese government, U.S. imperialism has continued to develop and massively produce various nuclear weapons, and has further expanded its nuclear bases around the world, intensifying its nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against China and the world. China's development of nuclear weapons is entirely for defense, and its ultimate goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons. We solemnly declare once again that China will never, under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese people sincerely hope that nuclear war will never happen.
    We are deeply convinced that as long as all peace-loving people and countries in the world work together and persist in struggle, nuclear war can be prevented. The Chinese people and the Chinese government will, as always, continue to work with all peace-loving people and countries in the world, unswervingly strive for the lofty goal of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

    高举毛泽东思想红旗，进一步加强国防力量、保卫祖国安全和世界和平
    我国进行含有热核材料的核爆炸成功
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委向参加核试验的解放军指战员和为核试验作出贡献的人员热烈祝贺
    中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，是为了反对美帝国主义及其合作者的核讹诈和核威胁，是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断、破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。
    我们再一次郑重宣布，中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。中国将继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器而共同奋斗。
    新华社九日讯　新闻公报
    一九六六年五月九日十六时（北京时间），中国在本国西部地区上空，成功地进行了一次含有热核材料的核爆炸。
    这次核爆炸试验，是中国人民为了进一步加强国防力量、保卫祖国安全和世界和平所取得的新的重大成就。
    中国人民解放军，科学技术人员和广大职工，在中国共产党的正确领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，坚持四个第一，活学活用毛主席著作，贯彻了党中央和毛主席制定的自力更生、奋发图强的方针，发扬了领导、专家和群众三结合，教育、研究和生产三结合，群策群力，大力协同的精神，保证了这次核试验的圆满成功。这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利。这是阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的伟大胜利。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    中国共产党中央委员会、国务院和中共中央军事委员会，向参加这次核试验的人民解放军全体指战员，向为我国的核试验作出贡献的工人、工程技术人员、科学工作者和一切有关人员，致以热烈的祝贺，并且希望他们再接再厉，在进一步加强我国的国防建设、实现国防现代化的斗争中，不断取得新的成就。
    中国进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，是为了反对美帝国主义及其合作者的核讹诈和核威胁，是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断、破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。中国人民掌握了核武器，对于正在争取解放而英勇斗争的各国人民是一个巨大鼓舞，对于保卫世界和平是一个新的贡献。
    在中国爆炸第一颗和第二颗原子弹的时候，中华人民共和国政府已经先后发表声明，阐明了中国对核武器的根本立场，并且具体建议召开世界各国首脑会议，讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器。
    从那个时候以来，美帝国主义不顾中国政府的声明，仍然继续发展和大量生产各种核武器，并且进一步扩大它在全世界的核基地，加紧对中国和全世界进行核讹诈和核威胁。中国发展核武器，完全是为了防御，其最终目的是为了消灭核武器。我们再一次郑重宣布，中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。中国人民衷心希望核战争永远不会发生。
    我们深信，只要全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家，共同努力，坚持斗争，核战争是可以防止的。中国人民和中国政府将一如既往，继续同全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家一道，坚定不移地为全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的崇高目标而共同奋斗。
