    Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued instructions, requesting the entire army to make persistent efforts in the ongoing nationwide mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's writings, and to greatly push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's writings in our army forward.
Raising the Understanding to a New Height
    The instructions pointed out that under the new situation, we must raise our understanding of the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's writings to a new height. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most vibrant Marxism-Leninism of our time, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, a beacon guiding the world's people's revolution, and the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for fighting against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all ghosts and monsters of various countries. In order to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world, we must further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought in order to keep up with the situation, more consciously shoulder the heavy responsibility of promoting the world revolution, and be good promoters of international revolution. Domestically, the socialist education movement is unfolding in depth on all fronts. The class struggle in society will inevitably be reflected in the Party and the army through various channels. To resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end and truly stand firm and withstand the great storms of class struggle, we must also study Mao Zedong Thought more diligently and truly become strong warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Within the army, to adhere to the proletarian military line, uphold giving prominence to politics, and ensure that we are never confused or turn away at any time, the only way is to better study and apply Mao Zedong's works in a living way, and use Chairman Mao's instructions as the only standard for distinguishing right from wrong and discerning truth from falsehood. The instructions said that at present, in our country, a new era in which the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, unprecedented in history, has begun. More and more people consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, actively realize the Third Five-Year Plan, and accelerate the great cause of socialist revolution and construction in our country. Under this situation, whoever does not work hard to study Chairman Mao's writings runs the risk of falling behind the times. Our army is a proletarian army personally founded by Chairman Mao and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao, we have the responsibility and the conditions to study even better, to answer the expectations of the Party and the people of the whole country.
Work Hard on the Word "Use"
    The instructions pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao instructed:
  "To creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, we must work hard, especially on the word 'use,' and regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all our army's work." This is the best summary of our army's experience in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in recent years, and it is also the long-term fundamental principle for the entire army to study Chairman Mao's works. Whether or not we work hard on the word "use" and practice it ourselves is the fundamental mark of whether we are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and whether we are studying genuinely or falsely. To work hard on the word "use," we must especially focus on the following points: First, we must use it to transform our world outlook, the most fundamental issue, in order to further promote the ideological revolutionization and work revolutionization of the troops. All personnel, especially leading cadres at all levels, must "place" themselves in the learning process, "reveal" their thoughts, use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize bourgeois individualism, overcome all selfish ideas centered on "self," and truly establish the idea of not seeking fame or profit, not fearing war or sacrifice, and serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. Learn to use Chairman Mao's dialectical materialist viewpoints of "practice first" and "one divides into two" to analyze and deal with all problems. Truly establish the style of going deep into reality, conducting investigation and research, and closely linking with the masses, and overcome subjectivism, bureaucratism, and the style of laziness. Second, we must use it to continue giving prominence to politics and resolving the struggle between the two lines of army building. Mao Zedong Thought is the foundation for giving prominence to politics in our army building, combat, and all our work. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's line and thought on army building, and correctly resolve the relationship between politics and military affairs, politics and technology, and people and things. We must adhere to democratic centralism, adhere to the correct principle of "the whole Party runs the military, military democracy, and collective wisdom and effort," advocate "collective discussion," oppose "one person making decisions," and make our army forever a docile tool of the Party. Third, we must use it to implement the strategic policies of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and strengthen preparations for anti-aggression war. Leading cadres at all levels must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, earnestly study Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, and regard this study as an important task in implementing the five principles of giving prominence to politics this year. In addition, comrades with reading ability should also combine the study of Chairman Mao's works with selective reading of relevant works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
    The instructions require Party committees at all levels to place the leadership of the troops' study of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work, earnestly strengthen learning guidance, and constantly summarize learning experiences. They must focus their leadership on grasping the study of leading cadres above the regimental level and truly change the situation in which the leadership lags behind the masses in learning. They must continue to discover and publicize good models, and summarize and promote advanced experiences.
  Ten Effective Methods
    The instructions summarized ten effective organizational forms and methods of creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought that have been effective in the past few years, and required all units to continue to promote them. These are: (1) When carrying out any work, performing any task, or holding a relatively important meeting, from the beginning of mobilization and deployment to the final inspection and summary, it is necessary to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's relevant discussions in a targeted manner, combined with the specific situation at the time and the active thinking of the troops, as a weapon for unifying thinking and solving problems, and cultivate the habit of learning whatever you do, learning while doing, and using what you learn. (2) Political education should use various forms to instill Mao Zedong Thought from various angles. When carrying out political movements, giving political lessons, Party lessons, and Youth League lessons, we must use Chairman Mao's works as basic teaching materials, focus on practical problems, combine them with active materials, and use Chairman Mao's viewpoints to analyze, answer, and solve problems. (3) The central study group of cadres above the regimental level is not only an organization for doing a good job in the learning of leading cadres themselves, but also an organization for guiding and leading the learning of the entire unit. It must improve the organization, adhere to the learning system, and truly learn to achieve results. (4) Units above the military level should, to the extent possible, continue to run study classes or training classes for cadres at all levels, combining the situation, tasks, and the ideological situation of cadres to study Chairman Mao's works and the instructions of the Central Committee and the Military Commission on current work. (5) Organize the daily reading well in a planned way. It should be targeted and closely integrated with management and education work and grasping active thinking. We must prevent spontaneous phenomena, but also avoid controlling it too rigidly. Agencies and units that are inconvenient to implement daily reading can use other methods such as learning days. (6) Small rectification campaigns are a good way to concentrate a certain amount of time, grasp one or two main ideological problems with universality, enlighten cadres and soldiers to consciously make revolution, and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the spirit of rectification. It is not only applicable to companies, but also to agencies. However, the number of times should not be too many, and we must adhere to positive education as the main focus, develop positive factors, and overcome bad tendencies. (7) Holding good application meetings is a method of working hard on the word "use" and should be gradually promoted, but guidance should be strengthened to improve quality. (8) Run the quotation boards well. We must select quotations well according to the problems, learn and do them, and compare them frequently. (9) For illiterate and semi-literate new soldiers, we must also guide them to study Chairman Mao's works such as the "Three Constantly Read Articles" through one-on-one activities, so that they can both learn Chairman Mao's works and improve their cultural level. (10) The troops' newspapers should regularly select and publish Chairman Mao's quotations, introduce the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works, and provide guidance materials, and constantly promote the study of Chairman Mao's works. The instructions said that when using the above methods, we must pay attention to practical results, not pursue fancy things, prevent triviality, and avoid formality.

    解放军总政治部指示全军
    把学习毛主席著作的群众运动大大推进一步
    新华社四日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近发出指示，要求全军在正在开展的全国学习毛主席著作的群众运动中，再接再厉，把我军学习毛主席著作的群众运动，大大地向前推进一步。提到新的高度来认识
    指示指出，在新形势下，我们对学习毛主席著作的伟大意义，要提到一个新的高度来认识。毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是指引世界人民革命的灯塔，是同帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派等一切牛鬼蛇神进行斗争的最强大最锋利的思想武器。为了支援世界各国人民的革命斗争，我们必须进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来，才能跟上形势，更自觉地挑起推进世界革命的重担，当好国际革命促进派。在国内，社会主义教育运动正在各个战线上深入展开。社会上的阶级斗争，必然会通过各种渠道反映到党内、军内来。要坚决把社会主义革命进行到底，在阶级斗争的大风浪中真正站得稳，顶得住，我们也必须更加勤奋地学习毛泽东思想，真正成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的坚强战士。在军内，我们要坚持无产阶级的军事路线，坚持突出政治，做到在任何时候都不糊涂，不转向，唯一的办法也是要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛主席的指示作为区别是非、辨别真伪的唯一标准。指示说，目前，在我国，一个前所未有的工农兵群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的新时代已经开始。越来越多的人自觉地运用毛泽东思想，进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动，积极实现第三个五年计划，加速推进我国社会主义革命和建设的伟大事业。在这种形势下，谁不努力学习毛主席著作，谁就有落在时代后头的危险。我军是毛主席亲手缔造、在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的无产阶级军队，在党中央、毛主席和军委、林彪同志的领导下，有责任也有条件学得更好一些，来回答党和全国人民的期望。在“用”字上狠下功夫
    指示指出，林彪同志指示：
  “活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在‘用’字上狠下功夫，要把毛主席的书当作我们全军各项工作的最高指示。”这是对我军近几年来活学活用毛主席著作经验的最好的概括，也是全军学习毛主席著作的长期的根本方针。学习毛主席著作是否在“用”字上狠下功夫，身体力行，是衡量我们是否忠于毛泽东思想，是真学还是假学的根本标志。在“用”字上狠下功夫，特别是要着重以下几点：第一，要用在改造世界观这个最根本的问题上，以进一步促进部队的思想革命化和工作革命化。全体人员，特别是各级领导干部，在学习中都要把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，用毛泽东思想去批判资产阶级个人主义，克服以“我”字为中心的各种私心杂念，真正树立不为名，不为利，不怕战争，不怕牺牲，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的思想。学会运用毛主席关于“实践第一”和“一分为二”的辩证唯物主义观点，去分析和处理一切问题。真正树立深入实际，调查研究，密切联系群众的作风，克服主观主义、官僚主义和懒汉作风。第二，要用在继续突出政治、解决两条建军路线斗争的问题上。毛泽东思想是我们在建军、作战和一切工作中突出政治的根本。我们一定要认真学习毛主席的建军路线、建军思想，正确解决政治和军事、政治和技术、人和物等关系问题。要坚持民主集中制，坚持“全党办军，军事民主，群策群力”的正确方针，提倡“群言堂”，反对“一言堂”，使我军永远成为党的驯服工具。第三，要用在贯彻执行党中央和毛主席的战略方针，加强反侵略战争准备上。各级领导，一定要遵照林彪同志的指示，认真学好毛主席的人民战争思想，把这一学习当作今年执行突出政治五项原则的重要工作来抓。此外，有阅读能力的同志，还应结合学习毛主席著作，选读马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的有关著作。
    指示要求各级党委，一定要把领导部队的毛主席著作学习放在一切工作的首位，切实加强学习指导，不断总结学习经验。要把领导重点放在抓好团以上领导干部的学习上，切实改变在学习上领导落后于群众的状况。要继续发现和宣传好的典型，总结、推广先进经验。
  十条有效的方法
    指示总结了十条过去几年来学习毛主席著作行之有效的组织形式和活学活用的方法，要求各部队继续推行。这就是：（一）进行任何一件工作，执行任何一项任务，召开比较重要的会议，从开始动员布置，直到最后检查总结，都要结合当时的具体情况和部队的活思想，有的放矢地活学活用毛主席的有关论述，作为统一思想，解决问题的武器，养成做什么就学什么，边做边学，学了就用的习惯。（二）政治教育要从各个侧面采用多种形式灌输毛泽东思想。搞政治运动，上政治课、党课、团课，都要以毛主席著作为基本教材，以现实问题为中心，结合活材料，运用毛主席的观点来分析、回答和解决问题。（三）团以上干部的中心学习组，既是搞好领导干部本身学习的组织，又是指导、带动整个部队学习的组织，必须健全组织，坚持学习制度，确实学出成绩来。（四）军以上单位，在可能的范围内，要继续举办各级干部的读书班或者集训班，结合形势任务和干部的思想情况，学习毛主席著作和中央、军委对当前工作的指示。（五）有计划地组织好天天读。要有针对性，要和管理教育工作、抓活思想紧密结合。要防止自流现象，也不要统得过死。不便实行天天读的机关和单位，可以采用学习日等其他办法。（六）小整风，是集中一定时间，抓住一两个带有普遍性的主要思想问题，启发干部战士自觉革命，用整风精神活学活用毛主席著作的一个好方法。不仅连队适用，机关也适用。但次数不要搞得过多，一定要坚持正面教育为主，发扬积极因素，克服不良倾向。（七）开好讲用会，是在“用”字上狠下功夫的一种方法，应当逐步推广，但要加强指导，提高质量。（八）办好语录板。要针对问题选好语录，学了就做，经常对照。（九）对文盲、半文盲的新战士，也要通过一对红活动，辅导他们学习“老三篇”等毛主席著作，使他们既学了毛主席著作，又提高了文化水平。（十）部队报纸要经常选登毛主席语录，介绍学习毛主席著作的经验和辅导材料，不断推动毛主席著作的学习。指示说，在运用上述方式方法的时候，一定要讲求实效，不要追求花样，防止烦琐，流于形式。
