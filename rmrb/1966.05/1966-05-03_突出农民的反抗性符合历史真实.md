    Our literary and art workers must complete this task, they must shift their standpoint, they must gradually shift, in the process of going deep among the workers, peasants and soldiers, going deep into actual struggles, and in the process of studying Marxism and studying society, they must gradually shift, shift to the side of the workers, peasants and soldiers, shift to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have literature and art that truly serves the workers, peasants and soldiers, truly proletarian literature and art.

    The revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is a ballet that truly serves the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our socialist era. We all like to watch the movie and opera "The White-Haired Girl," and every time we watch it, we receive a class education. This time, after watching the re-created ballet "The White-Haired Girl," the content of class education was deepened, giving me new insights. This is the truth that is prominently displayed in the ballet: Where there is oppression, there is resistance.

    In the ballet, Yang Bailao and Xi'er are successfully portrayed as peasant images full of rebellious spirit. On New Year's Eve, the landlord Huang Shiren, in the name of collecting debts, forcibly seizes Xi'er. Yang Bailao immediately fights the enemy. Although he unfortunately dies after being beaten, his spirit of resistance leaves a deep impression on people. After Xi'er is taken to the Huang family, she does not become a "slave" who kneels and begs for mercy in front of the rulers. She stands tall and fights the enemy, refusing to be humiliated. Finally, she escapes from the Huang family, which makes people feel very happy. When Xi'er encounters her mortal class enemy, Huang Shiren, in the "Grandma Temple," she angrily raises the candlestick and smashes it. This is not just smashing at one of her enemies, but smashing at the dark society and feudal forces. She wants to smash the evil old world. The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" highlights the rebellious nature of peasants in a way that fully conforms to historical truth.

    The rising sun rises from the East, Xi'er's hometown is liberated, but she does not stop fighting because she has gained happiness and punished her enemy Huang Shiren, but takes up her gun and continues the revolution. The sinful old society left Xi'er with scars and marks of the whip, and therefore buried in the depths of her heart an unparalleled hatred for the exploitative system. She deeply understands that there are still thousands upon thousands of class brothers and sisters living inhuman lives under the exploitative system. To liberate our class brothers and sisters, we must carry the revolution through to the end!

    The ballet is always connected by a red line of daring to struggle. It makes me recognize once again a truth, which is what Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries, if you don't hit them, they won't fall." The organized workers and peasants, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, finally stood up.

    However, the class enemies are not reconciled to this. They are always trying in every possible way to make us return to the days of suffering. At the same time, two-thirds of the world's people are still suffering. Therefore, we must be doubly vigilant, always hold our guns tightly, and fight to the end against the class enemies and the imperialists and modern revisionists. I am a people's soldier, a naval shooter. I want to carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, have the motherland in my heart, have the world in my eyes, practice my shooting skills well, and, together with the people of the world, severely strike and eliminate our common enemies, until all the people of the world are liberated like Xi'er!

    突出农民的反抗性符合历史真实
                    解放军海军战士　韩杰
    我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。
    革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是真正为我们社会主义时代工农兵群众服务的舞剧。电影和歌剧《白毛女》，我们都很喜欢看，每看一次，都受到一次阶级教育。这次看了经过再创作的芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，加深了阶级教育的内容，使我又有了新的体会。这就是在舞剧中所突出表现的这个真理：哪里有压迫，哪里就有反压迫的斗争。
    在舞剧中，成功地把杨白劳和喜儿塑造成为富有反抗性的农民形象。在除夕的晚上，地主黄世仁以要债为名，强抢喜儿，杨白劳当即同敌人进行搏斗，最后虽不幸身遭毒打而死，但是他的反抗精神给人们留下了深刻的印象。喜儿被抢到黄家后，没有成为一个在统治者面前屈膝乞怜的“奴隶”，她挺起胸来和敌人斗争，不受敌人污辱，最后终于逃出黄家，让人看了心里很痛快。喜儿同她的不共戴天之仇的阶级敌人——黄世仁在“奶奶庙”相遇的时候，她愤怒地举起蜡台砸去。这不单单是向她的一个仇人砸去，而是在向黑暗社会和封建势力砸去，她要打碎那万恶的旧世界。芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》这样突出农民的反抗性完全符合历史的真实。
    旭日从东方升起来了，喜儿的家乡解放了，可是她并未因为自己获得了幸福和惩办了仇人黄世仁就不再进行斗争了，而是扛起枪来，继续革命。罪恶的旧社会给喜儿留下了一道道的鞭痕，一个个伤疤，因此在她心灵的深处埋下了对剥削制度的无比仇恨，她深深理解，还有千千万万的阶级弟兄在剥削制度下过着非人的生活，要解救阶级弟兄，就必须将革命进行到底！
    舞剧始终是由敢于斗争的一条红线联结起来的，它让我再一次认识了一个真理，这就是毛主席说过的：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”。组织起来的工农群众，在党和毛主席的领导下，终于翻了身。
    可是，阶级敌人并不因此而甘心，他们总是千方百计地想让我们退回到受苦受难的日子去；同时，世界上还有三分之二的人民正在受苦受难。因此，我们一定要加倍警惕，永远紧握手中枪，与阶级敌人和帝国主义者、现代修正主义者斗争到底。我是个人民战士，海军射手，我要发扬解放军的光荣传统，胸怀祖国，放眼全球，练好射击本领，和全世界人民一道，狠狠地打击和消灭我们共同的敌人，直到全世界人民都象喜儿一样获得解放！
