    "The Way of King and the Way of the Hegemon" is a big poisonous weed. In this article, Deng Tuo adhered to the positions of imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, viciously attacking the proletarian dictatorship, attempting to realize capitalist restoration, and implementing dictatorship over the working people. We must carry the socialist revolution through to the end, never forget class struggle, and never relax our grip on the gun and the seal.

    Deng Tuo, the big boss of the "Three-Family Village" black inn, and an anti-Party and anti-socialist element, in this poisonous weed "The Way of King and the Way of the Hegemon," gnashed his teeth and viciously attacked the proletarian dictatorship, scolding our Party for "relying on power," "being overbearing," and "unpopular"; saying that the way of the king is much better than the way of the hegemon, and that the way of the king should be implemented. This is an important piece of evidence of his series of anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, exposing his reactionary conspiracy to subvert the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

    We say: we must implement the proletarian dictatorship against class enemies. After the people seize political power, those handful of reactionaries and monsters who are unwilling to be eliminated and are bent on making trouble must be deprived of their right to speak. They are only allowed to be honest and are not allowed to talk nonsense or act recklessly. This method was not created by our proletariat, but learned from the enemy. Chairman Mao said: "The revolutionary dictatorship and the counter-revolutionary dictatorship are opposite in nature, but the former is learned from the latter. This learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling the counter-revolutionary class, they will not be able to maintain political power, their political power will be overthrown by internal and external reactionaries, internal and external reactionaries will be restored in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer."

    Since mankind entered class society thousands of years ago, the exploiting classes have been implementing dictatorship over the working people. That handful of people, who neither farm nor work, hold the knives and only allow the vast working people to be beasts of burden, not allowing the working people to be masters of their own affairs, and the working people do not even have the right to speak. They are only allowed to kill and set fires, and the working people are not allowed to light lamps, and the lives of the people are not guaranteed. Years of bloody lessons have made the people understand that only by grasping the seal and holding the gun tightly can they truly be masters of their own affairs. Chairman Mao said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power by armed force." The Party and Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to take up guns, use revolutionary violence to overthrow the counter-revolutionary violence that had ruled the people for thousands of years, and the working people, starting in 1949, seized political power and implemented dictatorship over the enemies of the people. Our People's Liberation Army is a tool for the Party to implement the proletarian dictatorship in China and is an important part of the proletarian dictatorship. Our task is entirely for the liberation of the people, to defend the people, and to work thoroughly for the interests of the people. To achieve this, we must hold the gun tightly, constantly consolidate and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and not allow open enemies and hidden enemies, including enemies who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and the Communist Party, to carry out sabotage and disruption. The tighter we hold the gun, the higher our vigilance against class enemies, the more powerful our dictatorship over the reactionaries will be, and the more the people will love and support us. Dictatorship over class enemies is the need of the revolution and the need of the people. Only by hating the enemy can we truly love the people; only by loving the people can we hold the gun tightly. It is precisely because the People's Liberation Army reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, has clear love and hatred, and implements dictatorship over a handful of reactionaries, that the people call us "the most beloved people" and regard us as their own sons and brothers from the bottom of their hearts. Wherever our troops march and camp, the people treat us as relatives. I remember that in a night march, in order to let us practice the superb skills of killing the enemy, an old man did not even sleep and led us the way with one deep foot and one shallow foot. He said to us: "Practice hard, hold the seal firmly, and subdue those ruthless villains!" Look! How much the broad masses of the people support our dictatorship over that handful of reactionaries who vainly attempt to obstruct social progress! Deng Tuo nonsense that we are unpopular, we must be unpopular with class enemies, and if we gain their hearts, we cannot gain the hearts of more than 95% of the people. Being kind to the enemy is being cruel to the people. Chairman Mao told us: even when it comes to love, in class society, there is only class love. The exploiting class will never love the proletariat, and the proletariat will never love the bourgeoisie. Just as we hate class enemies, imperialism, revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are constantly hating us and destroying us. Deng Tuo, who wears the signboard of a Communist Party member, viciously attacks the proletariat and hates the proletarian dictatorship. Obviously, he has stood on the same position as imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries.

    Deng Tuo kept saying that "the way of the king" is much better than "the way of the hegemon." He also said: "The so-called way of the king is actually when people, in a certain historical period, deal with all problems, according to the prevailing human sentiments and social moral standards at that time, and under the premise of not violating the political and legal system at that time, adopt a certain attitude and action." He also said: "The so-called way of the king can be interpreted as the ideological style of the mass line that honestly proceeds from reality." Deng Tuo is talking nonsense! He equates the ideological style of the mass line that our Party advocates, which proceeds from reality, with the so-called "way of the king" of the rulers of the exploiting class. This is completely attacking the Party and fabricating history. In a society ruled by the exploiting class, both the "way of the king" and the "way of the hegemon" are the dictatorship of the landlord class and are counter-revolutionary violence. Birds of a feather flock together. The exploiting class lives by drinking the blood of the people; the labor capacity of the poor, including their children, is regarded as a cash cow by the exploiting class. In order to deceive and numb the people, the ruling class sometimes adopts two hands. In addition to suppressing the people by force, they often disguise themselves, talking about benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but hiding knives in their hearts. Although I have not personally seen how the reactionary ruling class in feudal society played two-faced tricks, I have seen the current imperialism playing the conspiracy of fake peace and real war. American imperialism is killing and setting fires everywhere in South Vietnam, bombing North Vietnam with planes, but singing the tune of peace in its mouth. When Japanese imperialists invaded our country, didn't they also talk about "the paradise of the way of the king" and "the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere"? In fact, it implemented the three-all policy of killing all, burning all, and looting all. This group of demons full of "the way of the king" established killing companies in our country and killed countless Chinese people. This is the so-called "way of the king"! At present, the Khrushchev revisionists are also playing two-faced tricks. On the one hand, they wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, and on the other hand, they do counter-revolutionary things; on the one hand, they oppress the domestic people, and on the other hand, they give some small favors. Killing, persecuting, and building the happiness of a few on the pain of the majority, this is the common essence of all exploiting classes. And being sweet-tongued and treacherous, hiding a knife in a smile, is a common trick used by all exploiting classes. What Deng Tuo opposes, the so-called "way of the hegemon," is openly and clearly opposing the proletarian dictatorship, and nakedly slandering the proletarian dictatorship. What Deng Tuo opposes is our implementation of dictatorship over a handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. He advocates implementing dictatorship over the broad masses of the working people. He himself is implementing it. Although he does not hold a gun in his hand, he holds poisonous arrows. In particular, he controls the *Qianxian* (*Frontline*), *Beijing Ribao* (*Beijing Daily*), and *Beijing Wanbao* (*Beijing Evening News*), turning the Party's newspapers into his anti-Party tools. These three newspapers published a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds produced by the "Three-Family Village" black inn, but they do not allow others to publish articles to criticize them. This is: only they are allowed to release poison, and others are not allowed to disinfect. Deng Tuo released so many poisonous arrows and also wrote articles asking others to "learn more and criticize less." This is only allowing him to say black words and sell black goods, and not allowing others to expose him. This is the dictatorship that Deng Tuo and his gang of reactionaries are implementing over our working people. Under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship and the people holding a powerful state machine, it is not difficult to imagine how fierce their rule over the broad masses of the working people would be if we relax our vigilance and allow the conspiracy of a handful of reactionaries in the "Three-Family Village" black inn to succeed, overthrow the proletarian dictatorship, and restore capitalism! The monsters and demons of the "Three-Family Village" black inn gave us a lesson from the negative side. They tell us: never forget class struggle, and never relax our grip on the seal!

    Deng Tuo used the fallacy of "the way of the king" and "the way of the hegemon" to attack the proletarian dictatorship, which is not a new trick. We are used to hearing these words. Imperialism and reactionaries of all countries scold us as "totalitarianism," and modern revisionism scolds us for autocracy. What distinguishes Deng Tuo from imperialism and revisionism is that imperialism and revisionism openly scold us, and we can see through them at a glance, while Deng Tuo speaks in black words. He scolded the proletarian dictatorship and is preparing to deny it and slip away. Deng Tuo is also a reactionary element who is carrying a "red flag" and wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, his danger is even greater. We must never let him slip away and resolutely smash his black inn thoroughly.

    Why do Deng Tuo and all reactionaries hate and attack the proletarian dictatorship without prior consultation? This is because we have a powerful proletarian dictatorship, and the enemies with guns dare not act blatantly, and the hidden enemies are even more frightened. Deng Tuo and his like scold us and hate us because the proletarian dictatorship has played a role against them. We have a powerful state machine, and it is not so easy for bourgeois elements and feudal forces to cooperate with imperialism and revisionism to carry out capitalist restoration in China. On the contrary, they will inevitably be bruised and bloodied and bring about their own destruction! To carry the socialist revolution through to the end, we must constantly consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. I am a revolutionary soldier, and I must hold the gun tightly, study Chairman Mao's books well, constantly improve my class consciousness, and keep my eyes bright. No matter whether the enemy comes from the open or the dark, whether he is from the "Three-Family Village" black inn or the "Four-Family Village" demon cave, whenever monsters and demons make trouble, we will drag them out and smash them to pieces!

### 《王道和霸道》的反动实质

    《王道和霸道》的反动实质
    沈阳部队某部排长　张国珍
    《王道和霸道》是一株大毒草。邓拓在这篇文章中，坚持帝国主义、修正主义以及一切反动派的立场，恶毒攻击无产阶级专政，妄图实现资本主义复辟，对劳动人民实行专政。我们要把社会主义革命进行到底，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不能放松手中的枪杆子和印把子。
    “三家村”黑店的大掌柜、反党反社会主义分子邓拓，在《王道和霸道》这篇毒草中，咬牙切齿地、恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政，骂我们党“依靠权势”、“蛮横逞强”、“不得人心”；说王道毕竟要比霸道好得多，要实行王道。这是他一系列反党反社会主义罪行中的一个重要罪证，暴露了他妄想推翻无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟的反动阴谋。
    我们说：对待阶级敌人就是要实行无产阶级专政。人民夺取了政权，对于那些不甘心被消灭、存心捣乱的一小撮反动分子、牛鬼蛇神，就要剥夺他们的发言权。只许他们老老实实，不准他们乱说乱动。这个办法，不是我们无产阶级创造出来的，而是从敌人那里学来的。毛主席说：“革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。这个学习很要紧。革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。”
    自从人类进入阶级社会的几千年以来，剥削阶级一直在专劳动人民的政。他们一小撮人，一不种田，二不做工，掌握着刀把子，只许广大劳动人民当牛当马，不许劳动人民当家做主，劳动人民甚至连说话的权利都没有。只许他们杀人放火，不许劳动人民点灯，人民生命毫无保障。多少年的血的经验教训，使人民懂得了：只有掌握印把子，握紧枪杆子，才能真正当家作主。毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权”。党和毛主席领导中国人民拿起了枪杆子，用革命的暴力推翻了几千年来统治人民的反革命暴力，劳动人民从一九四九年开始，掌握了政权，对人民的敌人实行专政。我们人民解放军是党在中国实行无产阶级专政的工具，是无产阶级专政的重要组成部分。我们的任务是完全为着解放人民的，保卫人民的，是彻底为人民利益而工作的。要做到这一点，就要握紧枪把子，不断巩固和加强无产阶级专政，不准许公开的敌人和暗藏的敌人，包括钻在革命队伍内部、共产党内部的敌人，进行破坏捣乱。我们把枪杆子握得越紧，对阶级敌人的警惕性越高，对反动派的专政就越有力，人民才会越爱戴我们，拥护我们。对阶级敌人专政，这是革命的需要，人民的需要。只有对敌人恨，才能真正对人民爱：只有爱人民，才能握紧枪杆子。正因为人民解放军读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，爱憎分明，对一小撮反动分子专了政，所以人民管我们叫“最可爱的人”，从心里把我们看成是自己的子弟兵。我们部队行军、野营，走到那里，人民都把我们当作亲人看待。记得在一次夜行军中，为了让我们练好杀敌的过硬本领，一个老大爷连觉都不睡，深一脚浅一脚地给我们带路。他对我们说：“好好练吧，把印把子握得牢牢的，把那些狠心的坏蛋制得服服的！”看！广大人民多么拥护我们对那一小撮妄想阻挠社会前进的反动分子专政！邓拓胡说我们不得人心，我们就要不得阶级敌人的心，得了他们的心就不能得百分之九十五以上人民的心。对敌人仁慈，就是对人民残忍。毛主席告诉我们：就说爱吧，在阶级社会里，也只有阶级的爱。剥削阶级绝不会爱无产阶级，无产阶级也绝不会爱资产阶级。象我们仇恨阶级敌人一样，帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派和国内的地富反坏右，无时无刻不在仇恨我们，破坏我们。挂着共产党员招牌的邓拓，恶毒地攻击无产阶级、仇恨无产阶级专政，很显然，他已经和帝国主义、修正主义及一切反动派站在一个立场上。
    邓拓口口声声说：“王道”比“霸道”好得多。还说什么：“所谓王道，实际上就是人们在一定的历史时期，处理一切问题的时候，按照当时通行的人情和社会道德标准，在不违背当时的政治和法律制度的前提下，所采取的某种态度和行动。”又说：“所谓王道，可以做一种解释，就是老老实实的从实际出发的群众路线的思想作风”。邓拓是在胡说！他把我们党提倡的从实际出发的群众路线的思想作风，和剥削阶级统治者的什么“王道”相提并论，这完全是在攻击党，伪造历史。在剥削阶级统治的社会里，什么“王道”、“霸道”，都是地主阶级专政，都是反革命暴力。天下乌鸦一般黑。剥削阶级是靠喝人民的血活着的；穷人的劳动能力，包括他们的子女，被剥削阶级当成摇钱树。统治阶级为了欺骗人民，麻痹人民，有时候采取两手，除了用武力镇压人民，还常常把自己伪装起来，口里讲仁义道德，心里却藏着刀。我虽然没有亲眼看见过封建社会里的反动统治阶级是怎样耍两面手法的，但是我看到了现在帝国主义玩弄假和平真战争的阴谋。美帝国主义在越南南方到处杀人放火，用飞机轰炸越南北方，嘴里却唱着和平的调子。日本帝国主义者侵略我国的时候，不是也大讲什么“王道乐土”、“大东亚共荣圈”吗？实际上它实行的是杀光、烧光、抢光的三光政策。这群满口“王道”的魔鬼，在我国建立了杀人公司，杀死了无数中国人民。这就是所谓的“王道”！当前，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也在搞两面手法。一面披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，另一面干着反革命的勾当；一面压迫国内人民，另一面又给点小恩小惠。残杀、迫害，把少数人的幸福建筑在多数人痛苦的基础上，这就是一切剥削阶级的共同本质。而口蜜腹剑、笑里藏刀，又是一切剥削阶级惯用的手法。邓拓反对的所谓“霸道”，是明打明吹地反对无产阶级专政，露骨地污蔑无产阶级专政。邓拓反对的是我们对一小撮地富反坏右实行专政，他主张要对广大劳动人民实行专政。他自己就在实行。他手里虽然不拿枪，但是他拿着毒箭。特别是把持着《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》，把党的报刊变成了他反党的工具，这三家报刊登了一大批“三家村”黑店出产的反党反社会主义的毒草，却不准许别人发表文章批驳。这就是：只许他们自己放毒，不许别人消毒。邓拓放了那么多毒箭，还写文章要别人“多学少评”，这就是只许他说黑话，贩黑货，不许别人揭露他。这就是邓拓这一伙反动家伙在专我们劳动人民的政。在无产阶级专政、人民掌握了强大的国家机器的条件下，邓拓之流还想对劳动人民专政，不难设想，如果我们放松警惕，让“三家村”黑店的一小撮反动分子的阴谋得逞，推翻了无产阶级专政，复辟了资本主义，他们对广大劳动人民的统治会是多么凶恶！“三家村”黑店的牛鬼蛇神从反面给我们上了一课，他们告诉我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不能放松手中的印把子！
    邓拓用“王道”和“霸道”的谬论攻击无产阶级专政，其实也不是什么新鲜玩艺。这些话我们听惯了。帝国主义和各国反动派骂我们是“极权主义”，现代修正主义骂我们专权。邓拓和帝国主义、修正主义不同的是：帝国主义、修正主义，公开骂我们，我们一眼能看穿，而邓拓讲的是黑话，他骂了无产阶级专政，还准备赖账、溜走。邓拓又是打着“红旗”，披着马克思列宁主义外衣的反动分子，因此，他的危险性更大。我们绝不能让他溜走，坚决把他的黑店彻底捣毁。
    邓拓和一切反动派为什么都不谋而合地仇恨和攻击无产阶级专政呢？这是由于我们有了强大的无产阶级专政，拿枪的敌人不敢明目张胆地活动，暗藏的敌人更是胆战心惊。邓拓之流骂我们，仇恨我们，就是因为无产阶级专政对他们起了作用。我们有强大的国家机器，资产阶级分子、封建势力要配合帝国主义、修正主义在中国闹资本主义复辟，就没有那么容易，相反，必然碰得头破血流，自取灭亡！我们要将社会主义革命进行到底，就要不断巩固无产阶级专政。我是一个革命战士，就是要握紧手中的枪杆子，好好学习毛主席的书，不断提高自己的阶级觉悟，把眼睛擦得亮亮的。不管敌人从明里来，还是暗里来，不管他是“三家村”黑店的，还是“四家村”妖洞的，牛鬼蛇神什么时候兴风作浪，我们就什么时候把它揪出来，砸它个稀巴烂！
