    Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Kantol delivered speeches at the reception.
    In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Royal Government of Cambodia, and the Cambodian people for their warm hospitality.
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that during his visit to Cambodia, they saw the Cambodian people working hard for the prosperity of their motherland and have already achieved great success in this regard. He said, "This powerfully proves that the principle of self-reliance adhered to by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Royal Government of Cambodia in construction is completely correct."
    He said, "China and Cambodia have both suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and colonialism in the past. After gaining independence and liberation, we all face the task of eliminating poverty and backwardness, and we have all encountered difficulties and problems of one kind or another in construction. Therefore, it is natural for our two countries to support each other and cooperate in construction. Our Cambodian friends often talk about China's assistance to Cambodia; but our assistance is actually very limited, and besides, this is our bounden international duty. We believe that support is always mutual, and some economic statistics simply cannot reflect the support and assistance given to our country by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Royal Government, and the Cambodian people. For this, we once again express our heartfelt gratitude to them."
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, "I would like to convey to you the concern of the Chinese government and people about the situation on the Cambodian border. At the instigation of the United States, South Vietnamese puppet troops invaded Takeo Province of Cambodia twice on April 15 and 18, killing and wounding Cambodians. The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on April 23 protesting the aggressors and calling on peace-loving and just countries to stop these acts of aggression. These days, Thai troops and South Vietnamese puppet troops have been constantly launching attacks on the Cambodian border. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I firmly support the solemn position expressed by the Royal Government of Cambodia in its April 23 statement, and I angrily condemn the acts of aggression committed by the United States and its South Vietnamese and Thai running dogs. On behalf of the Chinese government, I reiterate that the 650 million Chinese people will always stand on the side of the Cambodian people and will resolutely support your just struggle to safeguard independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."
    In his speech, Prince Norodom Kantol thanked Vice Premier Li Xiannian for the profound friendship that this visit brought to the Cambodian people, and warmly wished China prosperity, Chinese leaders good health, and the continuous development of the friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people.
    The reception was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
    After the reception, Prime Minister Prince Norodom Kantol, on behalf of Cambodian Head of State Sihanouk, awarded medals to Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Deputy Director Wang Daohan, and other accompanying personnel of Vice Premier Li Xiannian.

    据新华社金边一日电　中国国务院副总理李先念结束了在柬埔寨的友好访问，四月三十日上午乘飞机离开这里回国。
    中国对外经济联络委员会副主任汪道涵也同机回国。
    到机场欢送的有：柬埔寨国家元首私人顾问宾努，柬埔寨副首相兼经济事务、财政和计划统筹大臣宋双，工业大臣蒲烈恰，商业大臣苏南，公共工程和邮电大臣殷吉，外交部秘书长阮柴里，柬埔寨国家银行副行长谢托，柬埔寨国家银行总监笃金，柬埔寨一中国友好协会第二副主席胡宁，和柬埔寨驻中国大使张岗等。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团委员陈宝剑，朝鲜驻柬埔寨大使姜卨模，越南民主共和国驻柬埔寨副代表阮水武也到机场欢送。
    中国大使陈叔亮，中国大使馆的官员，中国专家和华侨代表也到机场欢送。
    据新华社金边三十日电　中国驻柬埔寨大使陈叔亮和夫人二十九日晚上在这里为在柬埔寨进行友好访问的中国国务院副总理李先念举行盛大的告别招待会。
    柬埔寨方面出席招待会的有：柬埔寨国家元首私人顾问宾努，内阁首相兼外交大臣康托尔亲王，内阁副首相兼国防大臣朗诺，内阁副首相兼经济事务、财政和计划统筹大臣宋双，王国议会议长蒙达那亲王，国民教育国务大臣西里·玛塔，国家元首办公室主任肖桑，工业大臣蒲烈恰，商业大臣苏南，公共工程和邮电大臣殷吉，司法大臣本·冯·瓦代以及其他政府高级官员和柬埔寨知名人士。柬埔寨驻中国大使张岗也出席了招待会。
    正在柬埔寨访问的越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团委员陈宝剑和中央委员会副秘书长黎文训，以及越南民主共和国驻柬埔寨的副代表阮水武，朝鲜驻柬埔寨大使姜卨模也应邀出席了招待会。
    李先念副总理和柬埔寨王国首相康托尔亲王在招待会上发表了讲话。
    李先念副总理在讲话中首先对诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王、柬埔寨王国政府和人民给予的盛情款待表示衷心的感谢。
    李先念副总理说，在柬埔寨访问期间，我们看到了柬埔寨人民正在为祖国的繁荣而辛勤劳动，并且在这方面已经取得了巨大的成就。他说：“这一点就有力地证明了诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府在建设方面所坚持的自力更生的原则是完全正确的。”
    他说：“中国和柬埔寨过去都遭受过帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫和剥削。在获得独立和解放以后，我们都面临着消灭贫困和落后的任务，在建设方面我们都遇到过这样或那样的困难和问题。因此，我们两国在建设事业中相互支援和进行合作是很自然的。我们的柬埔寨朋友们经常讲中国对柬埔寨的援助；可是我们的援助实际上是十分有限的，何况这是我们应尽的国际义务。我们认为，支援始终是相互的，经济方面的一些统计数字根本不能反映诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王、王国政府和柬埔寨人民给予我国的支持和援助。为此，我们再一次向他们表示衷心的感谢。”
    李先念副总理说，“我要向你们转达中国政府和人民对柬埔寨边境局势的关切心情。在美国的唆使下，南越伪军在四月十五日和十八日两次侵入柬埔寨茶胶省，打死和打伤了柬埔寨人。柬埔寨王国政府四月二十三日发表声明，对侵略者提出了抗议，并且呼吁爱好和平和正义的国家制止这些侵略罪行。这些天来，泰国军队和南越伪军不断向柬埔寨边境发动进攻。我代表中国政府和人民坚决支持柬埔寨王国政府在四月二十三日的声明中所表明的严正立场，并且愤怒谴责美国及其南越和泰国的走狗所犯下的侵略罪行。我代表中国政府重申，六亿五千万中国人民永远站在柬埔寨人民一边，并将坚决支持你们为维护独立、主权和领土完整而进行的正义斗争。”
    康托尔亲王在讲话中为李先念副总理的这次访问给柬埔寨人民带来的深厚友谊表示感谢，并且热烈祝愿中国繁荣，中国领导人身体健康和中柬两国人民之间的友谊不断发展。
    招待会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。
    招待会后，内阁首相康托尔亲王代表柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王向李先念副总理以及汪道涵副主任和李先念副总理的其他随行人员授了勋章。
