    Cambodian Newspaper Says Sino-Albanian Joint Statement Has Great Significance
    Revolutionary People Must Heighten Vigilance to Distinguish True and False Friends
    United Front Only Meaningful When Excluding American Imperialist Accomplices
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 16th - The "Cambodge Soir" published a commentary on the 16th pointing out that "The China-Albania joint statement is a document of extremely great significance to all those who are struggling against the world's reactionary forces headed by U.S. imperialism."
    The commentary expressed support for the proposition in the joint statement to establish an international united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The commentary said: "The anti-imperialist international united front is only truly meaningful when it excludes the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, the running dogs of their running dogs, their hidden servants and accomplices, and gathers together all truly anti-imperialist forces. This is a particularly important aspect of the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism."
    The commentary said: "It is no longer a secret to anyone that some regimes that superficially oppose imperialism are serving the warmongers in Washington. Other regimes have in fact sold the entire interests of their countries to American capitalists and monopoly groups, and therefore have no freedom of action or thought. Still other regimes play with revolutionary rhetoric, proclaim themselves defenders of the weak and oppressed, and boast of being beacons for all peace-loving and justice-seeking peoples of the world, while in reality they attempt to impose their great-power chauvinism and capitulationist ideas on all anti-imperialist fighters in the world."
    The commentary emphasized: "Among these various kinds of goods, the last kind is the most harmful and the most dangerous, because this accomplice of U.S. imperialism is the most difficult to identify and the most hidden. It is harmful because it mixes into the ranks of democratic and popular forces, undermines all the efforts made by democratic and popular forces. It is a malady of the heart and attacks the anti-imperialist movement from its foundation. It propagates erroneous ideas and principles, paralyzing the fighting vigilance and determination of the masses."
    The commentary said: To fight against U.S. imperialism, it is necessary to support all those who are fighting against oppression, injustice, and exploitation. There must be no compromise with the enemies of the people and the enemies of democratic forces. It is necessary to be more vigilant than ever before in order to distinguish true friends from false friends.

    柬埔寨报纸说中阿联合声明具有重大意义
    革命的人民必须提高警惕分辨真假朋友
    统一战线只有排除美帝同谋者才有意义
    新华社金边十六日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》十六日发表评论指出，“中国阿尔巴尼亚联合声明，在所有为反对以美帝国主义为首的世界反动势力而斗争的人看来，是具有极为重大意义的文件。”
    评论表示支持联合声明中提出的建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的国际统一战线的主张。评论说：“反帝国际统一战线，只有排除美帝国主义的走狗，他们的走狗的走狗，他们的隐蔽的仆从和同谋者，把一切真正反帝的力量集合起来，才真正有意义。这是反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的斗争这个问题的一个特别重要的方面。”
    评论说：“对任何人来说，这已经不是什么秘密：一些表面上反对帝国主义的政权在为华盛顿的好战分子效劳。另外一些政权事实上已把国家的整个利益出卖给美国资本家和垄断资本集团，因而没有任何行动和思考的自由。还有一些政权玩弄革命词藻，自称是弱者和被压迫者的捍卫者，把自己吹嘘成为爱好和平和伸张正义的各国人民的灯塔，而实际上却企图把它们的大国沙文主义和投降思想强加于世界上所有反对帝国主义的战士。”
    评论强调指出：“在上述这些形形色色的货色之中，最后一种最害人、最危险，因为美帝国主义的这种同谋者是最不容易识别，最隐蔽。它之所以害人，是因为它混在民主和人民的力量的队伍里，破坏民主和人民的力量所作的一切努力，它是心腹之患，从根本上进攻反帝运动，它宣传错误的思想和原则，麻痹人民群众的斗争警惕性和决心。”
    评论说：为了同美帝国主义作斗争，就必须声援所有为反对压迫、非正义和剥削而斗争的人们。决不能同人民群众的敌人和民主力量的敌人作任何妥协。必须比以往任何时候更加提高警惕，以便分辨真朋友和假朋友。
