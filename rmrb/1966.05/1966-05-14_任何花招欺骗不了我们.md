    No Tricks Can Deceive Us

    The *Beijing Daily* re-published some materials from the "Three-Family Village" black shop gang on April 16, and added an editor's note to cover them up. Although the editor's note and those materials were carefully crafted, they could not deceive the eyes of the workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and cadres in our county were very angry after reading the editor's note and the materials. They held discussions and wrote articles, pointing out sharply that the purpose of Deng Tuo and his gang was to "unite and launch a wild attack on the Party and socialism," to "disguise themselves and shoot poisonous arrows against the Party and socialism," to "attack the dictatorship of the proletariat," and to "attempt to usurp the leadership of the Party and realize capitalist restoration."
    The rural postman of the Hebei Postal Branch of our county wrote in an article: Deng Tuo's articles, such as *“Great Empty Talk”* and *“An Egg's Worth of Property”*, used some ancient stories and foreign fables to viciously attack the three red flags of our Party, echoed the right-leaning opportunists, and slandered our three red flags as "great empty talk" and "replacing reality with fantasy," as "boasting." This is completely telling lies with open eyes. Wei Mosen of Da Zicaowu Commune pointed out in a discussion: Deng Tuo talked a lot about "generalists" in his article *Welcoming “Generalists”*. What kind of people are the "generalists" he was talking about? Deng Tuo's meaning is very clear, they are people like Wu Nanxing. They are called "generalists", seemingly without any class character, but in fact they are bourgeois and feudal-class politicians, only using the signboard of "generalists" to confuse right and wrong, poison and numb the people. What is the real intention of their desperate praise of "generalists"? It is to let this kind of "generalists" lead everything, realize capitalist restoration, and engage in peaceful evolution. Dou Xiuzhen of Liangxiang Commune pointed out: Deng Tuo and his gang wanted to engage in peaceful evolution and regarded the dictatorship of the proletariat as a thorn in their side. In his article *The Way of the King and the Way of the Hegemon*, he subtly slandered our dictatorship of the proletariat as "hegemony" and wanted to restore the "way of the king" of feudal emperors. Since April 17, everyone has been writing to the *Beijing Daily*, sending in records and articles from discussion meetings to criticize the "Three-Family Village" black shop gang, especially criticizing their shopkeeper Deng Tuo. However, for more than twenty days, these manuscripts and materials have been suppressed by the *Beijing Daily* and ignored. During this period, the *Beijing Daily* did not publish articles from workers, peasants, and soldiers in other places criticizing Deng Tuo, and did not even mention his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.
    We want to question the *Beijing Daily*: You claim to "launch a serious criticism" of the "Three-Family Village" and *Yanshan Night Talks*, so why haven't you published a single article from the workers and peasants that exposed their anti-Party and anti-socialist essence? This can only show that you are using the name of criticism to cover up the truth, raising the banner of struggle while engaging in protection; it shows that you are still acting as a tool for Deng Tuo and his gang's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, faithfully serving them. On May 9, you reprinted articles from the *Liberation Army Daily* and the *Guangming Daily* criticizing you, and expressed that "no matter how serious the nature of these errors, we must resolutely correct them." We will wait and see if this is true or false. However, the eyes of the workers and peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the brightest. No tricks can deceive them, and no anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons can escape the criticism and struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. All poisonous weeds must be resolutely and thoroughly eradicated!

    任何花招欺骗不了我们
    中共北京房山县委　汤家厚　毛锡恩　仇运武
    《北京日报》于四月十六日，重新发表了“三家村”黑店一伙人的一些材料，并且加了一个掩护他们的编者按。尽管编者按和那些材料是经过精心编制的，但是它瞒不过用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农群众的眼睛。我们县广大工农群众和机关干部，看了编者按和材料后，非常气愤，纷纷座谈写文章，一针见血指出，邓拓一伙人的目的，就是“联合起来向党、向社会主义猖狂进攻”，是“伪装打扮，射出了反党、反社会主义的毒箭”，是“攻击无产阶级专政”，“妄想篡夺党的领导权，实现资本主义复辟”。
    我县河北邮电支局乡邮员写文章说：邓拓的《“伟大的空话”》、《一个鸡蛋的家当》等文章，借用一些古代的故事和外国的寓言，对我们党的三面红旗进行了恶毒的攻击，与右倾机会主义者一起摇旗呐喊，污蔑我们的三面红旗是“伟大的空话”“以空想代替现实”，是“吹牛皮”。这完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。大紫草坞公社魏墨森在座谈会上指出：邓拓在《欢迎“杂家”》一文中，大谈“杂家”。他说的“杂家”，是一伙什么样的人呢？邓拓的意思很清楚，就是吴南星这一类“家”。他们名叫“杂家”，好象没有什么阶级性，实际上他们是资产阶级、封建阶级的政治家，不过是用“杂家”这个招牌来混淆是非，毒害麻痹人民。他们这样死命的吹捧“杂家”的真实用意是什么呢？就是要让他们这一类“杂家”去领导一切，实现资本主义复辟，搞和平演变。良乡公社豆秀珍指出：邓拓这伙人想搞和平演变，把无产阶级专政看成眼中钉。他在《王道和霸道》一文中，拐弯抹角地把我们的无产阶级专政污蔑是“霸道”，而要恢复封建帝王的“王道”。大家从四月十七日起就陆续给《北京日报》写稿写信，寄去座谈会的记录和文章，批判“三家村”黑店一伙人，特别是批判他们的掌柜邓拓。但二十多天来，这些稿件和材料，一直被《北京日报》扣压起来，置之不理。在这一期间，《北京日报》也没有发表其他地方工农兵群众批判邓拓的文章，更没提他反党反社会主义。
    我们要质问《北京日报》：你们口口声声要对“三家村”和《燕山夜话》“展开严肃的批判”，为什么对工农群众戳穿他们反党反社会主义本质的稿件一字不发？这只能说明，你们不过是借批判之名，行掩护之实，打起斗争的招牌，干着包庇的勾当；说明你们到现在还在充当邓拓一伙反党反社会主义的工具，忠实地为他们服务。五月九日，你们转载了《解放军报》和《光明日报》批判你们的文章，并表示“不管这些错误的性质多么严重，我们一定要坚决改正”。是真是假，我们将拭目以待。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农群众的眼睛最亮，任何花招都欺骗不了的，任何反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神都逃不脱工农兵群众的批判、斗争，一切毒草都必须坚决彻底铲除！
