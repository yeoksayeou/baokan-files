    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Saigon: More than eight thousand workers and laborers in Saigon, disregarding the suppression by a large number of troops and police dispatched by the US-puppet clique, held a large-scale anti-American demonstration on International Labor Day, "May Day."
    According to Western news agencies, on "May Day," more than eight thousand workers and laborers in Saigon held demonstrations on Saigon's main streets and around the US "Embassy." Demonstrators shouted "Yankees go home!" in front of the US "Embassy." They held hundreds of placards demanding that the American aggressors immediately stop the war of aggression against Vietnam and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems. The demonstrators also strongly condemned the US crimes of conducting chemical warfare in South Vietnam and wantonly massacring the Vietnamese people, condemned the hardships brought to the people's lives by the massive increase of US troops in South Vietnam, and demanded increased wages and improved living conditions for the working people.
    It is reported that the US-puppet clique was very uneasy about the Saigon laboring people's "May Day" demonstration, and they dispatched a large number of armed military police to protect the US "Embassy" and prevent the masses from demonstrating. The US authorities in Saigon also ordered Americans in Saigon not to go to the streets on this day to avoid being beaten. United Press International admitted that the scale of the Saigon workers and laborers' "May Day" anti-American demonstration was "most shocking to the Americans."

    西贡“五一”爆发大规模反美示威
    八千群众高呼“美国佬滚回去”
    新华社二日讯　西贡消息：西贡八千多名工人和劳动人民不顾美伪集团出动大批军警镇压，在“五一”国际劳动节举行了大规模的反美示威。
    据西方通讯社报道，“五一”这一天，西贡的八千多名工人和劳动人民在西贡的主要大街上和美国“大使馆”周围举行了示威。示威群众在美国“大使馆”前高呼：“美国佬滚回去！”他们举着数百个标语牌，要求美国侵略者立即停止侵越战争，让越南人民自己解决自己的问题。示威群众还强烈谴责美国在南越进行化学战争和肆意屠杀越南人民的罪行，谴责美国大规模增兵南越以后给人民生活带来的苦难，要求增加工资和改善劳动人民的生活。
    据报道，美伪集团对西贡劳动人民在“五一”节举行示威非常不安，他们出动了大批武装军警来保卫美国“大使馆”，并且阻止群众进行示威。西贡的美国当局还下令西贡的美国人在这一天不要上街，以免挨揍。合众国际社承认，西贡工人和劳动人民“五一”节反美示威的规模“对美国人来说是最令人震惊的”。
