    Major Victory of the Lao People's Anti-American Struggle
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently issued a memorandum announcing that since May 17, 1964, when U.S. imperialism directly dispatched its air force to bomb the Lao liberated areas, the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians have shot down more than 370 U.S. bandit aircraft and damaged several hundred. The Chinese people express their warm congratulations to the Lao people on this major victory in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression.

    For two years, the U.S. Air Force has dispatched various types of modern jet aircraft to carry out increasingly rampant attacks on the Lao liberated areas. U.S. military aircraft have increased from a few sorties every few days to dozens or even hundreds of sorties every day; from harassing transportation lines and coordinating the activities of the right-wing army, to indiscriminately bombing densely populated areas, schools, hospitals, and temples; from launching and dropping ordinary shells and bombs to using large quantities of napalm bombs, phosphorus bombs, and chemical poisons. U.S. imperialism has attempted to use extremely savage and brutal means of burning down peaceful villages on a large scale and indiscriminately killing innocent people to force the Lao people to submit to America's will of aggression. However, the result of two years of contest is not that U.S. planes and bombs have conquered the Lao people, but that the Lao People's Liberation Army and militia guerrillas, with their tenacious fighting will, have used light weapons to beat the U.S. aerial bandits to a pulp. The "American air superiority" boasted by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has been thoroughly bankrupt in Laos, just as it has been in Vietnam.

    For two years, the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians have not only severely attacked the U.S. Air Force invading Laos, but also given a powerful counterattack to the Lao right-wing army, which, in coordination with the U.S. Air Force, has continuously carried out "sweeps," harassments, and large-scale offensives against the Lao liberated areas, eliminating more than 23,000 enemies and consolidating and defending the Lao liberated areas. This is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism's plot to occupy the central and lower Laos region and link South Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand together.

    The brilliant achievements of the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians in resisting the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' attacks from the air and ground once again powerfully demonstrate that people's war has unlimited and powerful power, and it can defeat any aggressive war launched by U.S. imperialism anywhere. As the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front pointed out, "Although U.S. imperialism has powerful weapons and dollars and is very ferocious, it is not to be feared. The united strength of the people will surely defeat them."

    Although U.S. imperialism's aggressive activities in Laos have suffered heavy defeats, it will not easily give up its policy of aggression against Laos. Since the beginning of April this year, the United States has repeatedly dispatched B-52 strategic bombers to drop a large number of bombs on the central and lower Laos regions. Recently, the Vientiane, Bangkok, and Saigon puppet cliques have met many times to discuss plans for coordinated action. The Johnson administration is stepping up preparations to send troops to occupy the central and lower Laos regions in order to coordinate with the South Vietnam battlefield and save the defeat of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The Lao people are sufficiently mentally prepared for this new adventurous plan of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam to Laos can only result in even more disastrous defeats and nothing else.

    老挝人民抗美斗争的重大胜利
    本报评论员
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近发表备忘录，宣布自从一九六四年五月十七日美帝国主义直接派遣空军轰炸老挝解放区以来，老挝爱国军民已经击落了美国强盗飞机三百七十多架，击伤了几百架。中国人民对于老挝人民在反对美帝国主义侵略斗争中的这一重大胜利，表示热烈祝贺。
    两年来，美国空军出动了各种类型的现代化喷气式飞机，对老挝解放区进行日益猖狂的袭击。美国军用飞机从间隔多天出动几架次，到连续每天出动几十架次以至几百架次；从骚扰交通线、配合右派军队活动，到对居民稠密区、学校、医院和庙宇进行狂轰滥炸；从发射和投掷一般的炮弹、炸弹，到大规模使用凝固汽油弹、磷质弹和化学毒药。美帝国主义企图用大量烧毁和平村庄，滥杀无辜人民的极端野蛮残暴的手段，迫使老挝人民屈从美国的侵略意志。但是，两年较量的结果，不是美国的飞机和炸弹征服了老挝人民，而是具有顽强战斗意志的老挝人民解放军和民兵游击队，用轻武器把美国空中强盗打得落花流水。美帝国主义及其走狗所吹嘘的“美国空中优势”，在老挝也象在越南一样，遭到彻底破产了。
    两年来，老挝爱国军民不仅痛击了入侵老挝的美国空军，同时也给在美国空军配合下不断向老挝解放区进行“扫荡”、骚扰和发动大规模进攻的老挝右派军队以有力的反击，消灭了敌人二万三千多名，巩固和保卫了老挝解放区。这对于美帝国主义企图占领老挝中、下寮地区，把南越、老挝和泰国连成一片的阴谋计划，是一个沉重的打击。
    老挝爱国军民在抗击美帝国主义及其走狗从空中和地面进攻所取得的辉煌战绩，又一次有力地说明，人民战争具有无限强大的威力，它能够挫败美帝国主义在任何地方发动的侵略战争。正如老挝爱国战线党中央委员会所指出的，“美帝国主义虽然有强大的武器和美元，很凶恶，但并不可怕，人民的团结力量必定能够打败它们”。
    美帝国主义在老挝的侵略活动虽然遭到了惨重的失败，但它是不会轻易放弃侵略老挝的政策的。今年四月初以来，美国接连出动B—52型战略轰炸机，向中、下寮地区投下大量炸弹。最近，万象、曼谷和西贡的走狗集团又多次会晤，讨论配合行动的计划。约翰逊政府正在加紧准备出兵占领中、下寮地区，以便策应南越战场，挽救侵越战争的败局。老挝人民对于美帝国主义的这一新的冒险计划，已有足够的精神准备。美帝国主义把侵略越南的战火扩大到老挝，它只能遭到更为惨重的失败，而决不会有别的结果。
