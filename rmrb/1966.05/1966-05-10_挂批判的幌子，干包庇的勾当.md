    Listening to the broadcast and reading the materials published in the May 8th People's Liberation Army Daily, "Deng Tuo's 'Yanshan Night Talks' is Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Talk," I was extremely indignant. This bad egg comprehensively slandered and attacked the Party and socialism. We, the working class, are determined to give a comprehensive counterattack. There must be reciprocity. It is not polite to only receive and not give back. Since you have attacked our beloved Party and our revolutionary cause, then we have gained the right to counterattack tit-for-tat.

    Deng Tuo said that our Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "telling big lies," "smashing our heads against the wall" in the face of facts. This is purely and utterly slander. Look at the facts. Take Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) for example. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of Angang workers continued to carry forward the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, and production technology has rapidly developed, reaching a new height. Due to the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, which combines daring to think and act with scientific analysis, we have exerted infinite power. The variety of steel products has increased significantly. Before the Great Leap Forward, we could only smelt some ordinary carbon steel, but now we can smelt a large number of various alloy steels. The various production links are more complete, and the technical force has been strengthened unprecedentedly. From mines and smelting to the steel rolling system, we have created many new technologies, new equipment, and new materials, many of which have reached the world's advanced level. The working class of our country, like Angang, has carried forward the spirit of the Great Leap Forward and successfully manufactured atomic bombs, 12,000-ton hydraulic presses, electron microscopes, electronic computers... I ask you, Deng Tuo, is this "bragging" and "telling big lies"! It is you who are "smashing your heads against the wall" in the face of facts, not us.

    Encouraged by the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, the working class of our country has enabled the rapid development of various production and construction undertakings. This is a happy event for the Chinese people and a happy event for the people of the world! So, why is Deng Tuo riding a donkey backwards and trying so hard to pull back, using historical discussions, knowledge transmission, storytelling, and jokes as a guise to release poisonous arrows and attack wildly? Obviously, he is not on the same vine as us, and his heart is not with us. That is to say, this is a fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. He stands on the bourgeoisie's position to look at the proletarian cause. Of course, our victory, from his point of view, is a failure. Conversely, if the bourgeoisie says good things about us, it just shows that there are problems with our work. Deng Tuo, you want to "change the sky" and "rebel," this is a pipe dream!

    It is worth noting that these poisonous weeds of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-people activities were released through the *Beijing Daily*, *Frontline*, and *Beijing Evening News*. At that time, some workers, peasants, and soldiers wrote articles to cut down this poisonous weed, but your three newspapers and periodicals did everything possible to obstruct it and refused to publish them. You only allow the big bad guys of the bourgeoisie to release poisonous weeds and do not allow the workers, peasants, and soldiers to cut down the poisonous weeds. What are your intentions? Who are you speaking for? What position are you standing on?

    The poisonous arrows were released through your three newspapers and magazines. You should have made a profound self-criticism. However, you did the opposite. On April 16th, you published a batch of materials in three pages under the banner headline "Criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and 'Yanshan Night Talks'," and published the editor's notes of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily*. However, this editor's note is a case of putting a sheep's head on to sell dog meat. It is using criticism as a façade, still peddling its own private goods, and engaging in protectionism, attempting to slip Deng Tuo through with a cold pot sticker—this is absolutely not allowed by us workers.

    Poison must be disinfected. We must pick up our pens and throw ourselves into the Cultural Revolution, resolutely struggle with Deng Tuo and a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to the end, and never stop until this anti-Party and anti-socialist black line is completely cut off.

    挂批判的幌子，干包庇的勾当
    全国劳动模范、鞍钢技术革新能手　王崇伦
    听了广播，看了五月八日解放军报刊登《邓拓的〈燕山夜话〉是反党反社会主义的黑话》这一材料内容，我十分气愤。这个坏家伙对党对社会主义进行了全面的诬蔑、全面的攻击，我们工人阶级决心予以全面的还击。有来有往嘛，光来不往也不成礼。你既然攻击了我们敬爱的党，我们的革命事业，那么我们就获得了针锋相对的回击的权利。
    邓拓说我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”，这纯粹是彻头彻尾的污蔑。请看事实，拿鞍钢来说，鞍钢广大职工在党和毛主席的英明领导下，继续发扬了大跃进精神，生产技术得到了迅速的发展，达到了一个新高度。由于敢想敢干与科学分析相结合的大跃进精神，我们发挥了无穷的威力，钢材品种有了显著增加，大跃进之前只能冶炼一些普通炭素钢，现在能够冶炼大量多种合金钢了。各生产环节之间更加完善了，技术力量空前加强，从矿山、冶炼到轧钢系统，创造了许多新技术新设备、新材料，其中许多方面达到了世界先进水平。我国工人阶级也同鞍钢一样发扬了大跃进的精神，制造成功原子弹、一万二千吨水压机、电子显微镜、电子计算机……。请问邓拓，这难道是“吹牛皮”“说大话”吗！在事实面前“碰得头破血流”的是你们，而不是我们。
    我国工人阶级在大跃进精神鼓舞下，使各项生产建设事业得到了迅速发展。这是中国人民的喜事，世界人民的喜事！那么，邓拓为什么倒骑毛驴猛往后使劲，利用谈历史、传知识、讲故事、说笑话作幌子，大放毒箭，大肆攻击呢？很明显，他不是我们一根藤上的，与我们两个心眼。也就是说，这是无产阶级与资产阶级之间的激烈斗争。他站在资产阶级立场上看无产阶级事业，当然，我们的胜利，从他的角度看就是失败。相反的，资产阶级说我们好的，恰恰说明我们工作出了问题。邓拓，你想“变天”“造反”，这是白日作梦！
    值得注意的是，邓拓反党反人民的这些毒草是通过《北京日报》、《前线》、《北京晚报》放出来的。当时一些工农兵写文章要砍掉这支毒草，而你们三家报刊百般阻挠，不给发表。你们只让资产阶级的大坏蛋大放毒草，不准工农兵砍毒草，你们居心何在？你们替谁说话？你们站在什么立场上？
    毒箭是通过你们三家报纸杂志放出来，你们本应做深刻的自我批判，可是，你们恰恰相反，在四月十六日以三个版的篇幅，在《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》这个通栏大标题下，发表了一批材料，并发表了《前线》、《北京日报》的编者按。可是，这个编者按却是个挂羊头卖狗肉的编者按，挂批判的幌子，贩卖的仍旧是那些私货，干着包庇的勾当，企图来个凉锅贴饼子——让邓拓溜过去，这是我们工人绝对不允许的。
    有毒一定要消毒。我们一定要拿起笔杆子投入到文化大革命的运动中去，坚决同邓拓一小撮反党反社会主义分子斗争到底，不彻底砍断这条反党反社会主义的黑线决不收兵。
