    Editor's Note: The U.S. imperialists and their followers have been constantly propagating the idea that "China is isolated." However, the Chinese people do not feel isolated in the slightest. We are living well, and we have friends all over the world. It is the U.S. imperialists who are becoming increasingly isolated. Even the American bourgeois press has to admit this and is lamenting it.
    Whether a country is isolated depends on whether its policies reflect or violate the wishes of its own people and the people of the world. Reflecting the wishes of the people will not lead to isolation; violating the wishes of the people will inevitably lead to isolation, regardless of whether the country is large or small, strong or weak. Today, the wishes of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism and to achieve the independence and liberation of oppressed nations and peoples. The United States uses force everywhere, interferes everywhere, and launches aggressions, violating the wishes of the people of all countries. Therefore, it is opposed everywhere and surrounded by the people of the world. U.S. imperialism is the most isolated. China supports the revolutionary struggles of oppressed peoples and nations, supports the struggles of all countries to safeguard independence and sovereignty, and correctly reflects the wishes of the people of the world. Therefore, we receive sympathy and support everywhere. We stand with the people of all countries and fight together. China is not isolated and will never be isolated.
    In order to extricate itself from its extremely isolated situation, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its armed suppression of national liberation movements, carrying out subversive activities against nationalist countries, and strengthening its control over its "allies." But the more U.S. imperialism does this, the more it isolates itself. U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world and will eventually be buried by the people of the world.
    
    (Xinhua News Agency, May 30) A commentary by a reporter from this agency: For some time, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries have been clamoring about "China's isolation." The most vocal among them are the heads of the U.S. ruling clique. In fact, it is not China that is in an extremely isolated situation, but U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and lackeys.
        
    Isolated Great Power, Lonely President
    
    Let us look at the pessimistic tones of U.S. imperialism itself: America's "prestige in the world has never been so low" (former U.S. Vice President Nixon, May 6th speech). The U.S.'s "position abroad is deteriorating," "we do not have a strong enough ally willing to share the risks and costs of Rusk's policies. We have become an isolated globalist power," and the U.S. faces the danger of "being alone in a major crisis in Asia, alone among the great powers of the world" (American commentator Lippmann, May 4th and 9th articles).
    American and Western European newspapers describe how the White House, the U.S. President's residence, has become the "loneliest place" in the world, and U.S. President Johnson has become a "lonely man," "troubled, restless," with a "wrinkled, withered face showing a helpless expression." This unlucky image of the head of U.S. aggression vividly reflects the situation of U.S. imperialism being deserted by its followers and facing an impasse.
    The isolation of U.S. imperialism is fundamentally determined by its aggressive policy of attempting to dominate the world. Because it invades and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere, it places itself in the position of the common enemy of the people of the world. The noose around its neck is getting tighter and tighter. On the other hand, the twenty years after the war have been twenty years of U.S. imperialism's increasing decline and collapse. Over the past twenty years, the balance of international class forces has undergone tremendous changes. The anti-imperialist revolutionary forces of the people of the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have flourished, giving the U.S. aggressors a series of heavy blows in repeated contests. The gap between the aggressive ambitions of the United States and the means to realize these ambitions is becoming increasingly exposed to the people of the world. Political injustice and loss of support, military and economic inability, and repeated failures are the inevitable fate of the U.S. aggressors.
        
    Winds and Thunder Surge Across the Five Continents, Global Noose Tightens
    
    The U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam is the focus of the current great struggle between U.S. imperialism and the revolutionary people of the world. It most prominently and centrally exposes a series of fatal weaknesses in the strategic position of the United States. In South Vietnam, with a population of only fourteen million, the U.S. aggressors have been beaten senseless and are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire. Washington has deployed 270,000 troops in South Vietnam, spending $35 million a day, in exchange for increasingly heavy casualties and one failure after another. Now, although the Johnson administration is preparing to increase its troops and act recklessly to the end, U.S. politicians cannot but admit that the South Vietnam battlefield has become a "bottomless pit" burying U.S. aggressors, with a bleak future and "no end in sight." The West German magazine Der Spiegel commented that "a great power has never fought such a futile battle against a small opponent," and this situation "shocks the world and horrifies the United States." Senator Stennis, chairman of the Senate Preparedness Subcommittee, said in late April that the fact that a small country like Vietnam "can contain us and require us to invest such a large military force should make us see what will happen and what will inevitably happen if similar wars occur elsewhere in the world."
    The support of more than 90 percent of the people of the world is the most important yardstick for judging who is truly isolated. The U.S.'s war of aggression against the people of South Vietnam has aroused a worldwide anti-American wave and a surge in the anti-war movement in the United States. As the U.S. "war escalates" in South Vietnam, the protests and condemnations of the people of the world become more and more intense. For more than a year, millions of people of different colors, religions, and political beliefs in the five continents of the world have held countless demonstrations protesting U.S. aggression in Vietnam. From Iceland to New Zealand, from Italy to Japan, from Tanzania to Argentina, from Canada to the Philippines, the cry of "Johnson, murderer!" demanding "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!" has been heard everywhere.
    The protest movement of the American people against their own imperialism is an important part of the world anti-American wave. With the continuous expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. rulers are intensifying their attacks on the living standards of the American working people and accelerating the implementation of fascism. This further promotes the development of the movement of the American people against the war of aggression against Vietnam, wave upon wave. In hundreds of cities in dozens of states across the United States, millions of people have joined the torrent of demonstrations and protests. Regardless of the threats and persecution of the authorities, they have adopted various forms of protest, from demonstrations and marches to hunger strikes and self-immolation. Today, the anti-war movement of the broad masses of the American people has formed a force that cannot be ignored, merging with the anti-American demonstration movement of the people of the world, and powerfully striking at the Johnson government's policy of aggression against Vietnam.
    The U.S.'s aggression and interference in other regions has also created results contrary to their wishes. Its bloody suppression of the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle of the Dominican people, its arrogant interference in the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of the Congolese (L) people, its subversion, creation of coups, support for the right wing, and suppression of national democratic movements in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have resulted in further exacerbating the hatred of the people of these countries and the people of the world for U.S. imperialism, making the anti-American struggle more deeply developed. The more the United States tries to use aggressive and interventionist means to prevent the so-called "domino" crisis of the U.S. aggressive front from collapsing one by one, the more regions around the world are brewing and erupting with the flames of anti-American revolution one after another. Senator Church said: "By adopting a policy of excessive intervention in the regions of Africa and Asia, the United States is setting itself on fire," and the result of doing so is that "anti-American sentiment is rising at an alarming rate."
        
    Aggressive Group Heading for Disintegration
    
    With the United States deeply mired in aggressive adventures in South Vietnam and Asia, losing sight of one thing while grasping for another, and its global strategic position seriously weakened, the allies of the United States are also accelerating their efforts to get rid of U.S. control and are becoming increasingly disobedient. The U.S. press complains that in the war of aggression against Vietnam, although Washington has tried its best to find accomplices everywhere, in addition to the lackeys like Park Chung-hee of South Korea providing some cannon fodder, all the major allies have even "refused to lift a little finger" to help the United States. These countries are unwilling to get involved in this "dirty war" that has nothing to do with them to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States, and they even openly express their dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s policy of aggression against Vietnam. Senator Mansfield, the Democratic leader of the Senate, said in a report at the beginning of this year: "The longer the (invasion of Vietnam) war continues in its current pattern, the more its scope expands, the greater the pressure will be on the relationship between the United States and its allies in the Far East and Europe."
    It is worth noting that the various alliances pieced together by the United States after the war are gradually heading for disintegration. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization are practically useless. As the strategic pillar of the United States in Western Europe, the North Atlantic Group is facing a crisis of survival due to the intensification of internal contradictions. The U.S.-France confrontation has taken on a global nature. France's announcement of its withdrawal from the military "integration" of the North Atlantic Group and its recovery of U.S. bases in France has severely hit the U.S.'s hegemonic position in Western Europe. Contradictions between other Western European countries and the United States are also developing. In Western Europe, the vital area of ​​the capitalist world, the status of the United States has plummeted. The May 9 issue of U.S. News & World Report had to admit that the "role the United States plays in the Atlantic Alliance has changed," "Europeans want to go their own way, and they are desperately trying to get rid of U.S. leadership. De Gaulle is just one example. The era of American rule (in Western Europe) may be coming to an end."
    This is the picture of U.S. imperialism facing a situation of being deserted by its followers. Now, the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is unfolding fiercely, and a new and greater anti-American revolutionary storm is coming. No matter how U.S. imperialism struggles, no matter how it vainly hopes to rely on the help of modern revisionists and reactionaries of various countries to get out of its predicament, it cannot change its destiny of isolation, failure, and final demise.

### 世界人民反美烈火把美帝及其走狗烧得焦头烂额走投无路  美帝推行全球扩张政策使它陷于全球孤立

专栏：

    世界人民反美烈火把美帝及其走狗烧得焦头烂额走投无路
    美帝推行全球扩张政策使它陷于全球孤立
    编者按：美帝国主义及其追随者，一直在宣传说什么“中国孤立了”。但是，中国人民丝毫也不感到孤立，我们的日子过得很好，我们的朋友遍天下。倒是美帝国主义的处境越来越孤立，连美国的资产阶级报刊也不得不承认这一点，并且纷纷发出悲叹。
    一个国家孤立不孤立，决定于它的政策是反映还是违反本国人民和全世界人民的愿望。反映人民的愿望就不会孤立；违反人民的愿望就必然孤立，不管这个国家是大国还是小国，是强国还是弱国。今天，全世界人民，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的愿望是反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义，实现被压迫民族和被压迫人民的独立和解放。美国到处使用武力，进行干涉，发动侵略，违背了各国人民的愿望，所以它到处遭到反对，处于全世界人民的包围之中，美帝国主义是最孤立的。中国支持被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，支持各国人民维护独立和主权的斗争，正确地反映了全世界人民的愿望，所以我们到处得到同情和支持，我们同各国人民站在一起，战斗在一起。中国并不孤立，也永远不会孤立。
    美帝国主义为了摆脱它极端孤立的处境，对民族解放运动加紧武力镇压，对民族主义国家进行颠覆活动，对它的“盟国”加强控制。但是，美帝国主义越是这样做，就越使得自己更加孤立。美帝国主义同全世界人民为敌，最后一定会被全世界人民所埋葬。
    新华社三十日讯　本社记者述评：一个时期以来，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派大肆叫嚷“中国的孤立”，其中叫嚷最凶的就是美国统治集团的头目们。其实，真正陷于极端孤立处境的不是中国，而是美帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗。
        孤立的大国，孤独的总统
    且看美帝国主义自己的悲观调子吧：美国在世界上的“威信从来没有这样低落过”（前美国副总统尼克松五月六日讲话）。美国“在国外的地位江河日下”，“我们没有一个相当坚强的盟国愿意为腊斯克的政策分担风险和代价。我们成了一个孤立的全球主义大国”，美国面临着“在亚洲的一个大危机中孑然一身，在世界大国中间孑然一身”的危险（美国评论员李普曼五月四日和九日的文章）。
    美国和西欧报界描写说，现在，美国总统府白宫成了世界上“最孤独的地方”，美国总统约翰逊成了一个“孤独的人”，他“烦恼、焦躁”，“满布皱纹的枯黄的面容显出束手无策的神情”。美国侵略头子的这副倒霉的形象，生动地反映了美帝国主义众叛亲离、走投无路的处境。
    美帝国主义的孤立，根本上是它妄想统治全世界的侵略政策所决定了的。由于它到处侵略、到处干涉别国内政，这就把自己置于世界人民公敌的地位，脖子上的绞索越套越多、越拉越紧。另一方面，战后的二十年，是美帝国主义日益衰落、走向崩溃的二十年。二十年来，国际阶级力量对比，发生了巨大的变化。全世界，特别是亚、非、拉人民反帝革命力量蓬勃发展，在反复较量中，给予美国侵略者以一系列沉重的打击。美国侵略野心和实现这一野心的手段之间的差距，越来越暴露在世界人民面前。政治上失道寡助，军事上和经济上力不从心、节节失败，这是美国侵略者的必然下场。
        五洲风雷激，全球绞索紧
    美国侵越战争是当前美帝国主义与世界革命人民的大搏斗的焦点，它最突出、最集中地暴露了美国战略地位的一系列致命弱点。在人口只有一千四百万的南越，美国侵略者被打得晕头转向，在泥潭里越陷越深，华盛顿在南越投入了二十七万兵员，每天消耗军费三千五百万美元，换来的是日益惨重的伤亡和一个接一个的失败。现在，尽管约翰逊政府准备增兵蛮干到底，美国政界人士却不能不承认，南越战场变成了埋葬美国侵略者的“无底洞”，前途渺茫“看不到尽头”。西德《明镜》周刊评论说，“一个大国还从来没有对一个小对手进行过这样徒劳无益的战斗”，这种情况“震惊世界，使美国为之骇然”。美国参院战备小组委员会主席斯坦尼斯四月下旬说，越南这样一个小国就“能够牵制我们，并且要我们投入这样大的军事力量，这应当使我们看到，如果世界别的地方发生类似的战争，将会发生和必然会发生什么情况。”
    全世界百分之九十以上的人民的人心向背，是判断谁真正孤立的最重要的标尺。美国对南越人民的侵略战争激起了全世界人民反美浪潮和美国国内反战运动的高涨。随着美国在南越的“战争升级”，全世界人民的抗议和谴责也越来越激烈。一年多来，全世界五大洲的千百万不同肤色、不同宗教、政治信仰的人民群众，举行了无数次的抗议美国侵略越南的示威。从冰岛到新西兰，从意大利到日本，从坦桑尼亚到阿根廷，从加拿大到菲律宾，到处响起了一片谴责“约翰逊，杀人犯！”要求“美国佬，滚出越南！”的吼声。
    美国人民起来反对本国帝国主义的抗议运动，是世界反美浪潮中的一个重要组成部分。随着侵越战争的不断扩大，美国统治者正在加紧进攻美国劳动人民的生活水平，加紧推行法西斯化。这就进一步促使美国人民反对侵越战争的运动一浪高过一浪地向前发展。在美国全国几十个州的上百个城市里，千千万万的人投入了示威抗议的洪流。他们不顾当局的威胁和迫害，采取了从示威游行到绝食自焚的各种抗议形式。今天，美国广大人民的反战运动已经形成了一股不可忽视的力量，同世界人民的反美示威运动汇合在一起，有力地打击着约翰逊政府的侵越政策。
    美国对其他地区的侵略和干涉，也造成了同他们的愿望相反的结果。它对多米尼加人民反美反独裁斗争的血腥镇压，对刚果（利）人民反帝爱国斗争的蛮横干涉，在亚非拉许多国家中进行颠覆、制造政变、扶植右派、扼杀民族民主运动，其结果是更加剧了这些国家人民和世界人民对美帝国主义的仇恨，使反美斗争更加深入地发展。美国越是企图用侵略干涉手段来防止美国侵略阵地一个挨着一个倒塌的所谓“多米诺”骨牌式的危机，全世界就越是有更多的地区一个接着一个地酝酿和爆发着反美革命的烈火。美国参议员丘奇说：“由于采取过多地干预非洲和亚洲地区的政策，美国正在引火烧身”，这样做的结果是“反美情绪正在以惊人的速度高涨起来”。
        侵略集团走向解体
    在美国深深陷入在南越和亚洲的侵略冒险、顾此失彼、它的全球战略地位遭到严重削弱的情况下，美国的盟国也加紧摆脱美国的控制，变得越来越不听指挥了。美国报界抱怨说，在侵越战争中，尽管华盛顿费尽了力气到处寻找帮凶，但是除南朝鲜朴正熙之类的走狗提供了一点炮灰之外，所有主要的盟国甚至“不肯动一动小拇指”来帮一下美国的忙。这些国家不愿意卷进这场同它们毫不相干的“肮脏战争”去为美国火中取栗，它们甚至公开对美国的侵越政策表示不满。美国参院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德在今年年初发表的一份报告里说：“（侵越）战争按照目前的格局继续得越久，它的范围扩大得越多，美国同它的远东和欧洲的盟国的关系受到的压力就会越大。”
    值得注意的是，美国在战后拼凑的各种联盟正在逐步地走向解体。东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织实际上已经不起什么作用。作为美国在西欧的战略支柱的北大西洋集团，由于内部矛盾的加剧而面临着生死存亡的危机。美法对抗已经带有全球性质，法国宣布退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构和收回美军在法国的基地，严重地打击了美国在西欧的霸权地位，其他西欧国家同美国的矛盾也在发展。在西欧这一片资本主义世界的要害地区，美国的地位一落千丈。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志五月九日的一期不得不承认，美国“在大西洋联盟中充当的角色已经改变”了，“欧洲人要走他们自己的道路，他们拼命摆脱美国的领导。戴高乐不过是一个例子。美国统治（西欧）的时代可能正在走向死亡。”
    这就是美帝国主义目前面临的一幅众叛亲离的图景。现在，全世界革命人民同美帝国主义及其走狗的搏斗正在激烈展开，一个新的、更大的反美革命风暴即将到来。不管美帝国主义怎样进行挣扎，不管它怎样妄想依靠现代修正主义者和各国反动派的帮助来解脱困境，也改变不了它的孤立、失败和最后灭亡的命运。（附图片）
