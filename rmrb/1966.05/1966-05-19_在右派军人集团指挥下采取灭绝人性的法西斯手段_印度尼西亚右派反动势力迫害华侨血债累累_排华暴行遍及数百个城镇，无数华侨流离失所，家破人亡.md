    Xinhua News Agency, 18th – Since October of last year, while vigorously opposing communism and the people, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have launched a violent anti-China and anti-Chinese countercurrent. They have not only repeatedly attacked Chinese diplomatic missions and injured Chinese diplomats, but also adopted inhuman fascist terror methods, frantically trampling and slaughtering overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia, plundering and destroying overseas Chinese property, closing down and seizing overseas Chinese associations and schools, and colluding with Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents, faithful running dogs of U.S. imperialism, to persecute overseas Chinese. Anti-Chinese atrocities have spread across hundreds of towns on large and small islands in Indonesia, leaving countless overseas Chinese displaced, families broken, lives lost, and in extremely tragic circumstances.
    The anti-China atrocities of the past six months or so have been organized and planned under the command of the Indonesian right-wing military group. Right-wing military and political authorities in various places openly dispatched fully armed army troops to cover and collaborate with thugs in persecuting overseas Chinese. They also provided vehicles and transportation and communication tools for the thugs, and even dispatched army officers to direct the scene. After seizing power on March 12, the right-wing generals' group openly promoted various anti-Chinese measures in the name of the government. In addition to continuing to burn, kill, rob, and loot overseas Chinese, they further massively closed down and seized overseas Chinese associations and schools, openly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, stepping up political persecution of overseas Chinese, and attempting to further adopt various vile means to completely deprive overseas Chinese of their livelihoods.
        Inhumanly Trampling and Slaughtering Overseas Chinese
    Under the command and organization of the Indonesian right-wing military and political authorities, fully armed army troops, along with thousands and hundreds of thugs armed with knives, axes, sticks, and other murder weapons, brutally beat, tortured, and bloodily slaughtered defenseless and innocent overseas Chinese, sparing neither the old nor the weak, nor women nor children. The atrocities of right-wing soldiers and thugs raping overseas Chinese women occurred everywhere.
    In October of last year, right-wing soldiers and thugs in Bireuen, North Aceh, forced all overseas Chinese who had hung flags of the People's Republic of China to gather together, beat them, robbed them of all their property, and cruelly murdered Wen Dashan, Huang Muxiang, Zeng Yumin, and Ye Boxiang, leaders of local overseas Chinese organizations. In November of last year, Huang Zonggui, an overseas Chinese in Jepara Regency, Central Java, was arrested by the Army Parachute Commando Regiment for illegal "interrogation," and on his way home, he was knocked to the ground by a group of thugs, doused with kerosene, and burned to death. Xie Wenjiao, secretary of the Kebonagung Chinese General Association in Malang Regency, was suddenly stabbed to death by thugs in front of his shop.
    In an anti-Chinese atrocity that occurred in Medan, Sumatra, and its surrounding areas in December of last year, hundreds of overseas Chinese were killed or injured. Overseas Chinese Huang Yazong was beheaded and killed; Zhan Yishui, leader of the Overseas Chinese General Association in Setia Budi, was stabbed more than twenty times and died; a family of five overseas Chinese fathers and sons were killed together, their eyes were even gouged out when they died. The massacre in Lombok Island in December of last year was even more appalling. On December 30 alone, more than 20 overseas Chinese were killed. Wu Yudian's wife was pregnant and about to give birth, the thugs locked her and her six children in the house, then set fire to the house, and the mother and seven children were burned to death. Li Yuanchou's wife, an overseas Chinese, had her ears and fingers cut off by thugs, who snatched her earrings and rings and threw her into the river to drown. Some overseas Chinese were beheaded, some had their limbs severed, and some were disemboweled. Zhang Zhongxiang and Zhang Meizhen were newlyweds, the thugs first killed Zhang Zhongxiang, then raped his wife, and finally brutally killed her. In January of this year, right-wing thugs in Meme Regency, Sumbawa Island, suddenly expelled all 140 households and more than 1,000 overseas Chinese, regardless of gender or age, from their homes at 3 a.m., and brutally beat and killed them, resulting in dozens of overseas Chinese casualties on the spot. Subsequently, the remaining overseas Chinese were all detained by the Indonesian military police and held for more than a month. During their unjust detention, these overseas Chinese were subjected to all kinds of abuse, and many were tortured and became ill. On April 20, armed military police and thugs in Simpang Ulim, North Aceh, drove all the local Chinese, regardless of gender or age, to run barefoot under the scorching sun in front of the regency chief's office for more than five hours, and many people fainted on the spot. The thugs also forced adult men to take off their clothes, poured various colors of paint on their heads, wrote anti-China slogans on their bodies, and beat them arbitrarily. Rao Jucai, chairman of the local Overseas Chinese General Association, was covered with paint on his face and body, and was dragged to parade through the streets. The thugs also took him to the wilderness and used knives to force him to confess to unwarranted crimes, but he was not intimidated by violence and remained unyielding.
        Large-Scale Looting and Destruction of Overseas Chinese Property
    In order to cut off the livelihoods of the vast number of overseas Chinese, the Indonesian right-wing military and political authorities instructed thugs in various places to frantically attack overseas Chinese shops and residences, and wantonly loot and destroy overseas Chinese property.
    On November 10 of last year, thousands of army personnel and thugs in Makassar, under the command of an army major sitting in an armored vehicle, rushed into overseas Chinese shops and residences to wantonly loot property, and destroyed goods, clothing, furniture, vehicles, and other items that could not be looted. The atrocities lasted from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and more than 2,000 overseas Chinese shops and residences were damaged, leaving countless overseas Chinese bankrupt and unable to live. On November 14 of last year, thugs from the Bantaeng camp in South Sulawesi burned all kinds of goods, utensils, and clothes that they had thrown into the streets in a concentrated manner when they attacked local overseas Chinese shops and residences, and even maliciously poured kerosene into rice and threw soap into wells. In an atrocity that occurred in Gapura, Central Java, in late October of last year, many overseas Chinese houses, including the Chinese General Association, the Chinese School, and two overseas Chinese factories, were set on fire by thugs. The streets where overseas Chinese lived were full of ruins, and there were countless homeless people everywhere. In January of this year, after all the overseas Chinese in Meme Regency, Sumbawa, were detained by the military police, groups of thugs broke into their homes and looted all their belongings, even prying off doors and windows. On the afternoon of February 11, thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces painted terrifying marks on the buildings of overseas Chinese shops and residences in Banjarmasin, door to door: a skull with two piles of crossed bones on each side. At 10 a.m. the next day, thugs in batches looted and destroyed the marked overseas Chinese shops and residences. While wreaking havoc, the thugs shouted slogans such as "Long live the armed forces," and the trailing military police raised their hands in response. On March 21 of this year, more than 1,000 right-wing thugs who had obtained a permit from the Lampung military authorities in advance carried out rounds of destruction and looting of local overseas Chinese shops after holding anti-China rallies and marches, and some overseas Chinese shops were damaged and looted as many as three or four times.
    Demolishing and Seizing Overseas Chinese Association Meeting Places and Overseas Chinese Schools
    On the day that Soeharto, one of the heads of the right-wing generals' group, announced the seizure of power on March 12, right-wing soldiers and thugs in Bandung systematically attacked and forcibly seized 13 local overseas Chinese schools. They frantically tore, trampled, and burned the Chinese national flags and images of Chinese leaders hanging in the schools, and wrote various anti-China slogans on the walls. The thugs also burned teaching equipment, various facilities, and students' belongings. Subsequently, right-wing authorities in various places successively organized thugs to attack and seize overseas Chinese schools. In Magelang, thugs even set fire to all the buildings of the Chinese School. On April 5, under the direction of the Indonesian government, the head of the Jakarta military authorities openly issued an order, viciously slandering overseas Chinese associations and overseas Chinese schools as "nests of subversives and counter-revolutionaries," and using this as an excuse to brazenly announce the closure and dissolution of overseas Chinese associations and overseas Chinese schools in the area. On April 6, Jakarta thugs rushed into Zhonghua Middle School, forcing the teachers and students of the school to hand over the keys in order to seize the school. When the thugs failed to achieve their goal, they threatened the teachers and students of the school with bayonets against their throats and chests, and injured 13 teachers and students of the school. The teachers and students of the school were not afraid of danger, were awe-inspiring and unyielding, and resolutely rejected the thugs' unreasonable demands. On April 8, in the process of attacking the Chinese Overseas Chinese General Association in Jakarta, Jakarta thugs illegally detained more than 120 employees of the association and overseas Chinese who came to handle affairs, beat and kicked them, and interrogated them barbarously one by one, and openly kidnapped Huang Muhe, an employee of the association, and eight other overseas Chinese, and subjected them to severe torture. Military authorities in West Java, Central Java, East Java, South Sumatra, North Sumatra, and South and Southeast Sulawesi have also successively ordered the closure of local overseas Chinese schools and organized thugs to seize the meeting places of local overseas Chinese associations. On April 12 and 23, right-wing soldiers led a large number of thugs to attack the two offices of the Surabaya Overseas Chinese Associations Federation in East Java. The thugs destroyed and looted the typewriters, radios, and various equipment in the two offices, injured Zheng Zhuoliang, director of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and nine staff members of the offices, and seized the two offices. At present, overseas Chinese education and welfare undertakings have been severely undermined. Because almost all overseas Chinese schools have been closed, more than 200,000 overseas Chinese students have dropped out of school, and more than 7,000 overseas Chinese teachers have lost their jobs.
          Right-Wing Military and Political Authorities Openly Collude with the Chiang Kai-Shek Bandits, and Persecute Overseas Chinese Even More Frenziedly
    Now, the right-wing military group is stepping up its use of Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents as tools to further persecute overseas Chinese, and is coercing overseas Chinese to betray their motherland. The right-wing authorities in Medan instructed Zeng Shaofan and others, local Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents, to take various measures to coerce overseas Chinese to participate in the anti-China "review" meeting on May 7, but few overseas Chinese participated. At this anti-China rally, Brigadier General Mosqueda, Chief of Staff of the Sumatra Inter-Regional Command, spoke on behalf of the command, openly slandering overseas Chinese as a "fifth column" and threatening overseas Chinese to "choose one between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China." After the meeting, Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents held an anti-China parade under the escort of military police, and once again attacked the Chinese Consulate and the Overseas Chinese General Association. Recently, under the instructions of the heads of the right-wing generals' group, Yang Weibin, a Chiang Kai-shek gang special agent in Jakarta and an agent of the Indonesian Army authorities, is carrying out large-scale activities to coerce overseas Chinese to participate in the so-called "oath of allegiance meeting" in order to cooperate with the right-wing military regime in creating another serious anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocity in Jakarta.
    The activities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces using Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents to create anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities are now gradually spreading to many other places. Military and political authorities in various places are asking Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents to provide information about overseas Chinese associations and overseas Chinese schools, asking them to advise on persecuting overseas Chinese, and acting as thugs to attack and destroy Chinese embassies, consulates, overseas Chinese associations, and overseas Chinese schools. Under the direction of the right-wing military and political authorities, Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents are threatening patriotic overseas Chinese not to hold positions in overseas Chinese associations, so that they can steal the leadership of overseas Chinese associations; they are also forcing patriotic overseas Chinese associations to "dissolve voluntarily," and they will set up pseudo-organizations as tools for the right-wing military regime to oppose China and exclude Chinese.
    Recently, there have been various signs that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are conspiring to further persecute overseas Chinese on a large scale. The heads of the right-wing are clamoring to take resolute measures against overseas Chinese. Nasution openly proposed at a meeting to restore the implementation of the decree prohibiting overseas Chinese retailers from operating in areas below the county level, attempting to deprive hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese of their livelihoods. Various right-wing organizations and newspapers also issued arrogant anti-Chinese calls, and the "Indonesian University Students United Action Organization" and the "Indonesian Youth and Students United Action Organization," two right-wing organizations, threatened to "take over" all the property of overseas Chinese. One right-wing newspaper even ominously "predicted" that there was a "possibility that millions of Chinese in Indonesia could be killed."

    在右派军人集团指挥下采取灭绝人性的法西斯手段
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨血债累累
    排华暴行遍及数百个城镇，无数华侨流离失所，家破人亡
    新华社十八日讯　自去年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在大举反共反人民的同时，掀起了一股反华排华的狂暴逆流。他们不仅一再袭击中国外交代表机构和打伤中国外交人员，而且采取灭绝人性的法西斯恐怖手段，疯狂地蹂躏和屠杀旅居印度尼西亚的华侨，掠夺和破坏华侨的财产，封闭和强占华侨社团和华侨学校，并且伙同美帝国主义的忠实走狗蒋帮特务分子迫害华侨。排华暴行遍及印度尼西亚大小岛屿上的数百个城镇，有无数华侨因而流离失所，家破人亡，陷于极其悲惨的境地。
    半年多来的反华暴行，都是在印度尼西亚右派军人集团的指挥下有组织、有计划地进行的。各地右派军政当局公然派出全副武装的陆军部队，掩护和协同暴徒迫害华侨。它们还为暴徒提供车辆和交通联络工具，甚至派出陆军军官在现场指挥。右派将领集团在三月十二日夺取政权后，就公然以政府的名义进一步推行各种排华措施。他们除了继续对华侨进行烧杀抢掠外，进而大规模地封闭和霸占华侨社团和华侨学校，公开与蒋匪帮合流，加紧从政治上迫害华侨，并企图进一步采取各种恶劣手段完全剥夺华侨的生计。
        惨无人道地蹂躏和屠杀华侨
    在印度尼西亚右派军政当局的指挥和组织下，全副武装的陆军部队伙同成千成百手执刀斧棍棒等凶器的暴徒，对手无寸铁的无辜华侨进行野蛮的殴打、折磨和血腥屠杀，连老弱妇孺也不能幸免。右派军人和暴徒强奸华侨妇女的暴行到处发生。
    去年十月，南亚齐必力埠的右派军人和暴徒强迫所有悬挂过中华人民共和国国旗的华侨集中起来，对他们进行殴打，抢走了他们的所有财物，并且残酷地杀害了当地华侨团体的领导人温达善、黄木祥、曾裕民和叶柏祥。去年十一月，中爪哇扎巴拉县华侨黄宗桂被陆军伞兵战斗团抓去非法“审讯”后，在回家途中又被一群暴徒打倒在地下，用煤油浇身烧死。玛琅县格班然中华总会秘书谢文蛟，在他的商店前突然被暴徒用刀刺死。
    去年十二月在苏门答腊棉兰市及其附近地区发生的一次排华暴行中，死伤的华侨达数百人。华侨黄亚宗被砍头而死；实打巴华侨总会领导人詹乙水被连刺二十多刀后身死；有一家华侨父子五人一齐被杀，死时连眼睛都被挖出来。去年十二月在龙目岛发生的大屠杀更是骇人听闻。仅十二月三十日一天被杀害的华侨就有二十多人。华侨吴玉殿的妻子正怀孕待产，暴徒将她和她的六个小孩关在屋内，然后纵火烧屋，母子七人都被烧死。华侨李元稠的妻子被暴徒割掉耳朵和手指，抢去耳环和戒指，抛入河中淹死。有的华侨被砍下头颅，有的被斩断四肢，有的被剖腹。张忠祥和张美珍是新婚夫妇，暴徒先杀死张忠祥，后奸污其妻子，最后又把她惨杀。今年一月，松巴哇岛美玛县的右派暴徒于清晨三点多钟突然把当地一百四十多户、一千多名华侨不分男女老幼全部逐出住所，并野蛮地加以殴打和残杀，当场就有数十名华侨伤亡。接着，其余的华侨又被印度尼西亚军警全部扣押起来，关押了一个多月，这些华侨在无辜被押期间遭受到百般虐待，许多人被折磨得患病。四月二十日，北亚齐司马委的武装军警和暴徒，驱赶当地所有华人，不分男女老幼，在烈日下赤足跑步到县长公署前曝晒五个多小时，不少人当场晕倒。暴徒们还强迫成年男子脱去衣服，把各色油漆浇在他们头上，在他们身上涂写反华标语，并肆意殴打他们。当地华侨总会主席饶举才满脸满身被涂上油漆后，又被拖去游街示众。暴徒还把他带到荒野，用刀威逼他承认莫须有的罪名，但他不畏强暴，始终不屈。
        大规模抢劫和破坏华侨财产
    印度尼西亚右派军政当局为了断绝广大华侨的生计，指使各地暴徒疯狂袭击华侨的商店和住宅，肆意抢劫和破坏华侨的财产。
    去年十一月十日，望加锡的数千名陆军人员和暴徒，在一名坐在装甲车上的陆军少校指挥下，冲进华侨的商店和住宅肆意抢劫财物，并把抢不走的商品、衣物、家具、车辆等加以捣毁。暴行从上午九时一直延续到下午七时，受到破坏的华侨商店和住宅达二千多户，有无数华侨因而倾家荡产，无法生活。去年十一月十四日，南苏拉威西万泰营暴徒在袭击当地华侨商店和住宅时，把各种商品、用具和衣服等都抛到大街上集中烧毁，甚至恶毒地把煤油倒进大米，把肥皂投入水井。去年十月下旬在中爪哇加布棉市发生的一次暴行中，许多华侨的房屋包括中华总会、中华学校和两座华侨工厂都被暴徒放火烧毁。华侨聚居的街道上到处是断垣残壁，无家可归者比比皆是。今年一月，松巴哇美玛县全部华侨被军警集中关押后，成群的暴徒就闯进他们家里，把所有物品洗劫一空，连门窗也被撬走。今年二月十一日下午，由印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒，在马辰华侨的商店和住宅的建筑物上，挨家挨户地涂上了恐怖的标记：一个骷髅的两旁，各有两堆交叉的尸骨。第二天上午十时，暴徒分批对涂有标记的华侨商店和住宅进行洗劫和破坏。暴徒在肆虐时，狂呼“武装部队万岁”等口号，尾随的军警还举手响应。今年三月二十一日，事先取得楠榜军事当局签发准字的一千多名右派暴徒，在举行反华集会和游行后，对当地的华侨商店进行轮番的破坏和抢劫，有的华侨商店被破坏、掠夺达三、四次之多。
    捣毁和强占华侨社团会所及华侨学校
    在三月十二日右派将领集团头目之一苏哈托宣布夺取政权的当天，万隆市的右派军人和暴徒就有计划地袭击和强行霸占了当地的十三所华侨学校。他们疯狂地撕毁、践踏、焚烧在学校里悬挂的中国国旗和中国领导人象，并在墙壁上涂写各种反华标语。暴徒们还焚烧教学用具、各种设备和学生的物品。接着，各地右派当局都相继组织暴徒袭击和强占华侨学校。在马吉朗，暴徒们甚至纵火焚毁了中华学校的全部建筑物。四月五日，在印度尼西亚政府的指使下，雅加达军事当局的负责人公然发布命令，恶毒地诬蔑华侨社团和华侨学校为“颠覆分子和反革命分子的巢穴”，并以此为借口悍然宣布封闭和解散这个地区的华侨社团和华侨学校。四月六日，雅加达暴徒冲进中华中学，强迫这个学校的师生交出钥匙，以便强占这所学校。暴徒达不到目的，就用刺刀对准学校师生的咽喉和胸膛进行威胁，并打伤这所学校的师生十三人。这所学校师生临危不惧，威武不屈，坚决拒绝了暴徒的无理要求。四月八日雅加达暴徒在袭击中华侨团总会的过程中，竟非法扣留这个侨团总会的职员和前来办事的华侨一百二十多人，对他们拳打脚踢，逐一进行横蛮的审讯，并公然绑架总会职员黄沐和及其他华侨共八人，加以严刑拷打。西爪哇、中爪哇、东爪哇、南苏门答腊、北苏门答腊、南和东南苏拉威西等地区的军事当局，也先后下令封闭当地的华侨学校，并组织暴徒强占当地华侨社团的会所。四月十二日和二十三日，右派军人率领大批暴徒袭击东爪哇泗水华侨社团联合会的两个办事处。暴徒们破坏和抢走了这两个办事处的打字机、收音机和各种设备，打伤了前来办事的中华商会总干事郑卓亮和办事处的工作人员共九人，并且强占了这两个办事处。目前，各地华侨的教育和福利事业已遭到严重摧残。由于华侨学校几乎全部被封闭，失学的华侨学生达二十多万人，失业的华侨教师有七千多人。
          右派军政当局公开与蒋匪帮合
      流，更加猖狂地迫害华侨
    现在，右派军人集团正在加紧利用蒋帮特务分子作为更进一步迫害华侨的工具，并胁迫华侨背叛祖国。棉兰市右派当局指使当地蒋帮特务分子曾少藩等人，采取种种手段胁迫华侨参加五月七日的反华“检阅”大会，但参加的华侨寥寥无几。在这次反华集会上，苏岛区际司令部参谋长莫斯基达准将代表司令讲话，公然诬蔑华侨为“第五纵队”，并威胁华侨在“印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国之间抉择其一”。会后蒋帮特务分子在军警的护卫下举行了反华游行，并再度袭击中国领事馆和华侨总会。最近，在右派将领集团头目的授意下，在雅加达的蒋帮特务分子、印度尼西亚陆军当局密探杨伟彬等人正在大肆活动，胁迫华侨参加所谓“宣誓效忠大会”，以配合右派军人政权在雅加达制造另一次严重的反华排华暴行。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力利用蒋帮特务分子制造反华排华暴行的活动，目前正逐渐扩展到其它许多地方。各地军政当局要蒋帮特务分子提供有关华侨社团华侨学校的情况，要他们为迫害华侨出谋划策，并充当袭击和破坏中国大使馆、领事馆和华侨社团、华侨学校的打手。在右派军政当局的指使下，蒋帮特务分子出面威胁爱国华侨不得再在华侨社团中任职，以便由他们窃取华侨社团的领导权；他们还强迫爱国华侨社团“自动解散”，而由他们另行成立伪组织，作为右派军人政权反华排华的工具。
    最近有种种迹象表明，印度尼西亚右派反动势力正在阴谋策划进一步大规模地迫害华侨。右派头子们大肆叫嚷要对华侨采取坚决措施。纳苏蒂安在一次集会上公然提出要恢复执行禁止县以下地区华侨零售商营业的法令，企图借此剥夺十几万华侨的生计。各种右派组织和报刊也发出狂妄的排华叫嚣，“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”这两个右派组织就扬言要“接管”全部华侨的财产。有一家右派报刊甚至杀气腾腾地“预言”：在印度尼西亚的“成百万中国人有被杀害的可能性”。
