    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 28th - The head of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, Lan Nhet, said here yesterday: "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest thinker of our time. He is the beloved and wise teacher of China's 650 million people, and the inspirer of lofty ideas."
    He said: "Thanks to Chairman Mao's thought, the Chinese people have been able to reach their current perfect and very strong stage, winning the world's admiration and making our enemies panic."
    Lan Nhet and the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation he led arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Changsha on the evening of the 26th, and left here by plane for home today.
    Lan Nhet, who once served as Cambodia's ambassador to China, spoke frankly to this agency's reporter yesterday about his impressions of his visit to China. He said that after returning here for a month-long visit, nearly four years after leaving China, he gained a great deal of feeling. He said: "I had the opportunity to see with my own eyes the tremendous progress made by our Chinese friends in the past four years."
    He emphasized: "I deeply admire all the achievements you have made under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought. What impressed me the most was the great success of your third nuclear test. This is the pride of the Asian people and the people of all countries in the world who are fighting against the imperialist powers and for independence and freedom. This is a serious warning to the atomic club powers that attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons."
    Head of Delegation Lan Nhet strongly condemned the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism. He said: "U.S. imperialism, as Chairman Mao said, is a paper tiger, and it cannot scare us. The Cambodian people, like the Chinese people, will resolutely fight against U.S. imperialist aggression once they are invaded by U.S. imperialism."
    He emphasized: "In this case, we will wage a just war to defend our independence and freedom. We are fighting for a just cause, and we will win. All those who fight against foreign aggression and injustice will receive the support of all peace-loving people. We also resolutely support the struggle of oppressed people against the war and aggression policies of U.S. imperialism." He said: "We firmly believe that U.S. imperialism will definitely be crushed and eliminated. In the struggle to crush U.S. imperialism, the great Chinese people will play a decisive role."
    He said: "The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are subjected to U.S. imperialist aggression should unite more closely in the struggle for independence and freedom. In Southeast Asia, we should especially support the heroic struggles of the Vietnamese and Laotian peoples against the American devils and resolutely drive our common enemy, the American devils, out."
    On the evening of the 27th, Lin Liming, acting governor of Guangdong Province, held a welcome banquet for Head of Delegation Lan Nhet and the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation he led. Lin Liming and Lan Nhet delivered warm and friendly speeches at the banquet. In his speech, Lin Liming praised the Cambodian people, under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, for resolutely defending their independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and for vigorously resisting the aggression, interference, and subversion of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. He praised the Cambodian people for upholding justice internationally, for waging a resolute struggle against the aggression and war policies of U.S. imperialism, for showing great courage and determination, and for resolutely following the path of independence and self-reliance, and for achieving great achievements in the development of their national economy and cultural undertakings. He said that the Chinese people expressed their admiration for the Cambodian people's spirit of striving for strength, daring to fight, and daring to win. In his speech, Lan Nhet warmly praised the militant friendship between Cambodia and China and the peoples of the two countries. He said that the friendship between Cambodia and China has a long history, and in recent years, this friendship has gained new development in the struggle against U.S. imperialism's implementation of aggressive policies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He expressed his firm belief that this friendship cannot be undermined by any force.
    He also quoted Prince Sihanouk's remarks that China is Cambodia's number one friend to praise the kinship-like friendship between Cambodia and China.
    The speeches of Lan Nhet and Lin Liming were met with extremely warm applause at the banquet. When the distinguished Cambodian guests arrived and departed from Guangzhou, Wang Lanxi, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, Zhong Ming, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, and others went to the airport to greet and see them off. Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, who accompanied the delegation on its visit to Guangzhou, also went to the airport to see the delegation off when it left Guangzhou.

    柬中友协代表团团长涅特盛赞中国的巨大进步
    毛主席是我们时代最伟大思想家
    由于有毛泽东思想，中国人民才能够达到目前完善的、非常强盛的阶段，赢得了世界的钦佩，而使我们的敌人一片惊慌
    新华社广州二十八日电  柬埔寨中国友好协会代表团团长兰·涅特昨天在这里说：“毛泽东主席是我们时代最伟大的思想家，他是中国六亿五千万人民爱戴的英明的导师，是崇高的思想的启发者。”
    他说：“由于毛主席的思想，中国人民才能够达到目前完善的、非常强盛的阶段，赢得了世界的钦佩，而使我们的敌人一片惊慌。”
    兰·涅特和由他率领的柬中友协代表团是在二十六日晚乘飞机从长沙到达广州的，并已在今天离这里乘飞机回国。
    曾经担任过柬埔寨驻中国大使的兰·涅特昨天向本社记者畅谈了他的访华观感。他说，在他离开中国将近四年之后重新来这里作为时一个月的访问的时候，他得到了非常多的感受。他说：“我有机会亲眼看到了最近四年当中中国朋友所实现的巨大的进步。”
    他强调说：“我非常钦佩你们在毛泽东思想鼓舞下所取得的一切成就。给我印象最深的是你们第三次核试验的伟大成功。这是亚洲人民和世界上为反对帝国主义大国、为争取和捍卫独立和自由而斗争的各国人民的骄傲。这是对企图垄断核武器的原子俱乐部大国的严重警告。”
    兰·涅特团长强烈地谴责了美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策。他说：“美帝国主义正如毛主席所说的是纸老虎，它吓不倒我们。柬埔寨人民同中国人民一样，在一旦遭到美帝国主义的侵犯时将坚决进行反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。”
    他强调说：“在这种情况下，我们将为保卫独立和自由而进行正义战争。我们为正义事业而斗争，我们会胜利的。所有为了反对外国侵略和非正义而斗争的人们是会得到一切爱好和平的人们的支持的。我们也坚决支持被压迫人民反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策的斗争。”他说：“我们坚信美帝国主义一定会被粉碎和被消灭。在粉碎美帝国主义的斗争中，伟大的中国人民将起决定性的作用。”
    他说：“受到美帝国主义侵略的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民应该更紧密地在争取独立和自由的斗争中团结起来。在东南亚，我们特别应该支持越南人民和老挝人民反对美国佬的英勇斗争，坚决把我们的共同敌人美国佬赶出去。”
    二十七日晚上，广东省代省长林李明为兰·涅特团长和由他率领的柬中友协代表团举行了欢迎宴会。林李明和兰·涅特在宴会上发表了热情友好的讲话。林李明在讲话中赞扬柬埔寨人民在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的领导下，坚决捍卫独立、主权和领土完整，有力地抗击了美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略、干涉和颠覆。他赞扬柬埔寨人民在国际上主持正义，同美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策进行了坚决的斗争，表现了极大的勇气和决心，并且坚决走独立自主的道路，在发展民族经济和文化事业方面取得了伟大的成就。他说，中国人民对柬埔寨人民这种奋发图强、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，表示十分敬佩。兰·涅特在讲话中热情地赞扬了柬中两国、两国人民之间的战斗友谊。他说，柬中两国的友谊有着悠久的历史，近几年来，在反对美帝国主义在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲推行侵略政策的斗争中，使这一友谊获得了新的发展。他表示坚信，这种友谊是任何力量也破坏不了的。
    他还引用西哈努克亲王关于中国是柬埔寨的头号朋友的讲话来歌颂柬中两国之间的亲戚般的友谊。
    兰·涅特和林李明的讲话，在宴会上博得了极其热烈的掌声。在柬埔寨贵宾到达和离开广州的时候，广东省副省长王阑西、广州市副市长钟明等曾到机场迎送。陪同代表团来广州访问的对外友协副会长丁西林在代表团离开广州时也到机场欢送。
