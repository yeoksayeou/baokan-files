    According to Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd: The American working class, deeply exploited and oppressed, is waging arduous and tenacious struggles to resist the rulers' shifting of difficulties and to defend their own basic rights. This struggle has seen a new upsurge since the beginning of this year, marking a further sharpening of the class struggle within the United States.

    In order to shift the burden of the war of aggression against Vietnam onto the workers, and to maintain a "stable" rear for the war, the American ruling clique is intensifying its attacks on the working people of its own country from both economic and political fronts. On the one hand, it insists on implementing the so-called wage and price "guidelines" to freeze wages in disguise. On the other hand, it attempts to deprive and restrict the working class's right to strike under the pretext of "national interest." Many American bourgeois newspapers admit that because wage increases cannot keep up with the rate of price increases, the real income of American workers is constantly decreasing; the lives of low-wage families are even more difficult. There is "growing discontent" among the working people (April 5th, *New York Herald Tribune*). The strikes that have erupted one after another across the United States in the first four months of this year are a counterattack against the ruling group's offensive.

    The great strike of 35,000 public transport workers in New York City, which began on New Year's Day, fired the first shot in this year's struggle. They defied the ban on strikes by municipal enterprise workers, held a continuous twelve-day strike, completely paralyzing public transport in this largest American city, and finally forced the authorities to agree to some of the workers' demands regarding improving living and working conditions.

    At the end of March, 8,000 firemen of eight major railway companies across the United States launched the largest railway workers' strike since the war, protesting against the capitalists' refusal of the workers' demands for job security. The strike affected thirty-eight states in the United States, bringing more than 12 percent of American railway transport to a standstill. U.S. President Johnson personally came forward to exert pressure.

    Nearly 60,000 miners (accounting for about 60 percent of the total number of miners in the bituminous coal mining industry) in eight states of the American bituminous coal producing region also broke through the obstacles of the authorities and right-wing union leaders, and launched a nationwide strike on April 11, demanding increased wages and the abolition of anti-strike regulations. As of the end of April, the strike was still expanding. This is the largest miners' strike in the United States in fifteen years.

    Militancy is an important feature of this year's strike struggles. The vast majority of strike struggles were spontaneously launched by grassroots masses.

    These strikes not only had to deal with the high pressure from the authorities and capitalists, but also had to cope with the obstruction and betrayal of right-wing union leaders. But the workers broke through numerous obstacles and persisted in the struggle.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that the masses of workers in many cities have begun to break away from the deception and control of right-wing union leaders and join the ranks of the struggle against aggression against Vietnam. In early March, gatherings attended by 1,200 and 300 trade union activists were held in New York and Detroit, respectively, to form organizations of trade union workers against the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    In addition, grassroots trade union organizations in many cities enthusiastically participated in local protest demonstrations against the American aggression against Vietnam. (Attached picture)

    反对垄断资本的压榨　不满约翰逊转嫁侵越战争负担
    美国工人斗争出现新高涨
    据新华社三日讯　备受剥削和压迫的美国工人阶级，正在为反对统治者转嫁困难和保卫工人自身基本权利而进行着艰苦的、顽强的斗争。这种斗争在今年以来出现了新的高涨，标志着美国国内阶级斗争的进一步尖锐化。
    为了把侵越战争的负担转嫁给工人，并且为了给侵越战争维持一个“稳定的”后方，美国统治集团正加紧从经济和政治两方面向本国劳动人民发动进攻。它一方面坚持实行所谓工资、物价“指导方针”以变相地冻结工资，一方面又力图以“国家利益”为借口剥夺和限制工人阶级的罢工权利。不少美国资产阶级报刊承认，由于工资增长赶不上物价上涨速度，美国工人的实际收入正在不断下降；低工资家庭的日子更是不好过。劳动人民中间存在着“日益增长的不满”（四月五日《纽约先驱论坛报》）。今年头四个月里，美国各地此伏彼起的罢工斗争，就是针对统治集团进攻作出的反击。
    纽约市三万五千名公共交通工人从元旦起举行的大罢工，打响了今年斗争的第一炮。他们蔑视不许市政企业工人罢工的禁令，举行了持续十二天的大罢工，使这个美国最大城市的公共交通完全陷于瘫痪，最后迫使当局答应了工人关于改善生活条件和劳动条件的部分要求。
    三月末美国全国八大铁路公司八千名司炉掀起了战后影响最大的一次铁路工人大罢工，抗议资方拒绝工人关于保障就业的要求。罢工波及美国的三十八个州，使美国铁路运输的百分之十二以上陷于停顿。美国总统约翰逊亲自出面施加压力。
    美国烟煤产区八个州的近六万名矿工（占烟煤采掘业矿工总数的百分之六十左右）也冲破当局和右翼工会头子的重重阻挠，从四月十一日起举行全国大罢工，要求增加工资和取消禁止罢工的规定。到四月末为止，罢工仍在继续扩大。这是十五年来美国规模最大的一次矿工大罢工。
    战斗性是今年罢工斗争的一个重要特色。绝大多数罢工斗争都是基层群众自发掀起的。
    这些罢工不但要对付当局和资方的高压，而且还要应付右翼工会头子的阻挠和叛卖。但是工人们冲破了重重障碍，坚持斗争。
    特别值得提出的是，许多城市的工人群众已经开始摆脱右翼工会头子的欺骗和控制，投入反对侵越的斗争行列。三月初在纽约和底特律两城市曾经先后举行了有一千二百名和三百名工会积极分子参加的集会，分别成立了工会工作者反侵越战争的组织。
    此外，许多城市的基层工会组织踊跃参加了当地举行的反对美国侵略越南的抗议示威活动。（附图片）
