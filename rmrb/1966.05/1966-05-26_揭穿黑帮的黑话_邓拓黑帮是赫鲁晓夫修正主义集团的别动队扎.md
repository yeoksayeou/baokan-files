    Exposing the Black Gang's Jargon
    -- The Deng Tuo Black Gang is the Vanguard of the Khrushchev Revisionist Clique
    Zha Ludaiqin
    The Deng Tuo black gang has been dragged out by the people. The ugly faces of this small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements have been exposed in broad daylight.
    The Deng Tuo black gang's frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism are an integral part of the anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities of class enemies at home and abroad. They are the agents of the domestic bourgeoisie, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They are also the vanguard of the Khrushchev revisionist clique.
    The Deng Tuo black gang frantically opposes our great Party and the socialist system, vainly attempting to promote "peaceful evolution" in our country and realize capitalist restoration. Precisely because of this, the Deng Tuo black gang yearns for and prostrates itself before the Khrushchev revisionist clique, willingly acting as their pawns. Many comrades have already pointed out that the Deng Tuo black gang viciously attacks the Party Central Committee and the Three Red Banners, singing exactly the same tune as the Khrushchev revisionists. What the Khrushchev revisionists say, the Deng Tuo black gang also says, echoing each other, as if from the same mold. This is by no means an accidental coincidence. For example, the Khrushchev revisionists cursed Chairman Mao's scientific thesis of "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" as "absurd" and "dogmatic theory." Deng Tuo also cursed "East Wind" and "West Wind" as "clichés"; the Khrushchev revisionists vilified our anti-imperialist struggle as "empty incantations" and "sonorous phrases," Deng Tuo also vilified the anti-imperialist struggle as "futile" and "great empty talk"; the Khrushchev revisionists cursed our Great Leap Forward as "adventurous," "boasting," and "voluntaristic," saying that the Great Leap Forward "failed" and the national economy "collapsed," Deng Tuo also cursed the Great Leap Forward as "wild bragging" and "flights of fancy," saying that the Great Leap Forward "smashed its head" and "destroyed all the family's eggs." Can this be said to be a coincidence?
    At the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961, the Khrushchev revisionist clique threw out the modern revisionist program of "Three Peacefuls and Two Alls," openly attacking the parties that adhered to Marxism-Leninism. On December 17 of the same year, Deng Tuo lavishly praised Khrushchev in his black-talk article "Gold on the Body of the May Beetle."
    Why was Deng Tuo so interested in the "May Beetle"?
    The May Beetle is originally an insect. Why was Deng Tuo so interested in it? There is a secret here that cannot be admitted, but must be admitted.
    Originally, Khrushchev (хрущев) in Russian means "May Beetle." Deng Tuo, afraid that others would not understand his black talk, specifically pointed out in the article that the May Beetle he was talking about was precisely this "May Beetle." Deng Tuo searched for words and phrases from old books to praise this "May Beetle," saying that it "embodies the beauty of gold and shines brightly." This means that in the eyes of Deng Tuo and his anti-Party, anti-socialist gang, Khrushchev, this great traitor, was simply a "big star" shining as brightly as the sun and moon.
    Deng Tuo repeatedly promoted "Gold on the Body of the May Beetle," and also said, "Now that we know that scientists in Czechoslovakia have done experiments and succeeded, why don't we try it too?" He even called on "enthusiastic friends to pay attention to the experiment when conditions permit and see what the results are."
    What do these black talks mean?
    We know that December 1961 was precisely the time when our national economy was facing temporary difficulties due to the Khrushchev revisionist clique's perfidy and years of natural disasters. Deng Tuo published this black talk at this time, revealing that its meaning was nothing more than: The national economy is in difficulty, Khrushchev has gold, go to Khrushchev for gold, follow Khrushchev! This is the black heart of Deng Tuo and his gang of Khrushchev's lackeys.
    Deng Tuo praised Khrushchev to the skies, and of course hated our anti-revisionist struggle to the core. Shortly before bringing out this "May Beetle," Deng Tuo also viciously attacked our anti-revisionist struggle as a "self-important" "student" who "kicks the teacher away after seeing that it is easy to enter the door" ("From Three to Ten Thousand"). He cursed our great Party as "a person with sores on his feet," and slandered our anti-revisionist struggle as "extending the foot to the neighbor's house," "so that foot pain is pushed out" ("Various 'Pushers'"). The Deng Tuo black gang was truly mad to the extreme.

    Attacking the Party's Correct Evaluation of Stalin Under the Guise of Talking About Medicinal Materials

    The Khrushchev revisionist clique repeatedly and repeatedly opposed Stalin, moving the corpse and burning the corpse, which aroused the boundless indignation of the broad masses of the people in our country. However, the Deng Tuo black gang threw out the black talk "Sanqi, Shanqi, and Tianqi" in February 1962, shooting another poisonous arrow.
    As everyone knows, how to evaluate Stalin is how to view the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat. On this issue, our Party has fundamental differences with the Khrushchev revisionist clique. In response to the Khrushchev revisionist clique's conspiracy to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism by opposing Stalin, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao repeatedly pointed out that Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist, and that his historical merits were primary and his mistakes were secondary. This completely correct evaluation of Stalin was commonly compared to "three-seven split," meaning that Stalin's merits outweighed his faults.
    Deng Tuo, as a lackey of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, attacked the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's evaluation of Stalin in every possible way. Under the guise of talking about the medicinal material "Sanqi," he insinuated, "Sanqi... this is fundamentally impossible, and the facts are by no means so," "It can be seen that the name Sanqi is indeed problematic." What is especially vicious is that Deng Tuo also said that Sanqi is "the most powerful tonic... given to elderly and frail patients. If young and strong lads eat a few bites, they will have nosebleeds and fever all over their bodies." Afraid that people would not understand, he further elaborated on his black talk, saying: "This principle is like the law of motion of other things... if it exceeds the limit, it becomes absurd and will immediately kill the patient. This is often the case with so-called 'quack doctors killing people.'" Everyone sees how venomous the class hatred of the Deng Tuo black gang, like the Khrushchev revisionist clique, holds towards Stalin, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao!

      What does the so-called "repetition of history" refer to?

    On September 9, 1962, the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army shot down an American imperialist U-2 spy plane. The people of China and the world were overjoyed and celebrated this great victory. However, the "Three-Family Village" black gang, with dark hearts and deep-seated hatred, immediately threw out the black talk "Will History Repeat Itself?" They said that the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 plane in 1960, and China shot down a U-2 plane in 1962, "We will really feel that history is being repeated exactly." What does the so-called "repetition of history..." mean? They have ghosts in their hearts and dare not say it directly, so they shamelessly stole Marx's words to suggest: "All great world historical events and figures can be said to appear twice," "The first time as a tragedy, the second time as a farce."
    Everyone knows that Marx's passage in "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" satirized the French Emperor Napoleon III. Marx compared Napoleon I to a hero in a tragedy, and compared Napoleon III, who attempted to "repeat" the history of Napoleon I, to a clown in a farce. The Deng Tuo black gang stole Marx's passage to viciously curse the Chinese people who shot down the U-2 plane as clowns in a farce who were "repeating" history, while praising Khrushchev as a hero in a tragedy.
    Who is the real hero, and who is the real clown?
    The great Chinese people led by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have always resolutely opposed American imperialism, which is known to the world and cannot be denied by anyone. However, people still remember that it was precisely the Khrushchev revisionist clique who, after the Soviet army shot down the U-2 plane, hastily sought "understanding" from American imperialism, released the pilot of the U-2 plane, and used this to engage in US-Soviet cooperation, and became intimately involved with American imperialism, the mortal enemy of the Soviet people and the people of the world. This is the real farce performed by the real clowns. The Deng Tuo black gang's praise of the clown as a hero only shows that they themselves are the most despicable clowns.

  Promoting Learning from Khrushchev Revisionism Under the Guise of Talking About Peking Opera

    On June 14, 1963, the Party Central Committee promulgated the brilliant programmatic document "Proposal Concerning the General Line of the International Communist Movement." The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and launched an open debate with the Khrushchev revisionist clique. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought shone brightly; the Khrushchev revisionist clique was exposed in its true colors before the people of the world and suffered a shameful defeat.
    At this time, the Deng Tuo black gang, who were wholeheartedly following the Khrushchev revisionist clique, were restless and impatient, and once again came out to serve the Khrushchev revisionist cause. On October 25 of this year, the "Three-Family Village" black gang threw out "Talking About the Shanghai School" in "Frontline". The black talk "Talking About the Shanghai School" superficially talked about the Shanghai School and the Beijing School in Peking Opera, but discerning people knew at a glance that they were promoting Khrushchev revisionism and attacking the Chinese Communist Party, which adhered to Marxism-Leninism, under the guise of talking about Peking Opera. The article talked about the advantages and disadvantages of the Beijing School and the Shanghai School in Peking Opera before liberation, and asked the Beijing School to learn from the Shanghai School. People can't help but ask, it has been more than ten years since liberation, and in 1963, it is still necessary for the pre-liberation "Beijing School" to learn from the pre-liberation "Shanghai School." Isn't this too absurd? Please note that there is a lot to this.
    The "Three-Family Village" black gang said: "Many Beijing School figures with orthodox ideas often criticize the Shanghai School, such as innovation, incongruity, gimmickism, and vulgar eroticism, regarding the Shanghai School as a heresy that must be overthrown." Who is the so-called "Shanghai School" referring to here? Isn't it precisely Khrushchev, who arbitrarily tampered with the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism, labeled the "Three Peacefuls" as "new," established the "Two Alls" as "different," talked nonsense everywhere, pandered to the public, made faces, tapped the table with his shoes, and advocated dancing the Aphee dance? The communists who adhere to the purity of Marxism-Leninism, that is, the so-called "figures with orthodox ideas" in the "Three-Family Village" black talk, are precisely the ones who want to overthrow the heresy of Khrushchev revisionism. Isn't this also clear?
    However, the Deng Tuo black gang "disagreed with this." They talked a lot about their black talk, calling Khrushchev revisionism the "Shanghai School" and alluding to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as the "Beijing School," saying that the "Shanghai School" "has many advantages that are worthy of our advocacy and learning," and that it is "the least conservative and the best at adapting to the needs of the contemporary era" and is "not bound by orthodox ideas." From these black talks, we can see that they have reached a state of fanatical worship of the Khrushchev revisionist clique. At the same time, they viciously attacked Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as "conservative ideas that are stuck in the mud" and a "biggest burden." They even presumptuously proposed to "prevent and overcome" the so-called "orthodox and conservative ideas" in "Beijing" and "learn from the Shanghai School."
    Deng Tuo black gang, you are too presumptuous, and you are too arrogant! If we follow you and "learn" from Khrushchev, we will lose our heads, the Party will be destroyed, and the country will be destroyed. Counter-revolution will be restored in China. This is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, ten thousand times impossible! You deliberately antagonize the people and vainly attempt to reverse the course of Chinese history and trample hundreds of millions of workers, peasants and soldiers under your feet again. Tell you, this is a daydream!
    The facts fully prove that the Deng Tuo black gang wears the same pair of pants as the Khrushchev revisionist clique. They are the special detachment of the Khrushchev revisionist clique in carrying out anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities. Like Khrushchev, they are careerists who have sneaked into the Communist Party and the people's regime to conspire to realize the restoration of capitalism.
    The Deng Tuo black gang's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist crimes are heinous. The people of the whole country, especially the broad masses of workers, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants, have already spoken out, angrily denouncing this small handful of vicious class enemies. It is fundamentally impossible for the Deng Tuo black gang to want to "retreat safely." Deng Tuo cannot escape, the "Three-Family Village" black gang cannot escape, "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," "Beijing Evening News," and other newspapers and periodicals that engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities with them and provided shelter and protection for them cannot escape, and all the ghosts and monsters who are anti-Party and anti-socialist cannot escape.
    "The four seas are raging with clouds and water, and the five continents are shaking with wind and thunder. To sweep away all pests, no enemy can resist." The "May Beetle" has been swept away by the people, and all anti-people pests will also be dragged out by the people and swept away!

    揭穿黑帮的黑话
    ——邓拓黑帮是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的别动队扎
    鲁岱沁
    邓拓黑帮被人民揪出来了，这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的丑恶嘴脸已经暴露在光天化日之下。
    邓拓黑帮向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，这是国内外阶级敌人反共、反华、反人民、反革命活动的一个组成部分。他们是国内资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的代理人，他们也是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的别动队。
    邓拓黑帮疯狂地反对我们伟大的党和社会主义制度，妄图在我国推行“和平演变”，实现资本主义复辟。正因为这样，邓拓黑帮对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，身心向往，顶礼膜拜，心甘情愿地充当他们的走卒。许多同志已经指出，邓拓黑帮恶毒地攻击党中央，攻击三面红旗，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者唱的是一模一样的滥调。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者怎么说，邓拓黑帮也怎么讲，一唱一和，如出一辙。这绝不是偶然的巧合。如，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者咒骂毛主席提出的“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是“荒唐无稽”的“教条主义理论”，邓拓也咒骂“东风”、“西风”是“陈词滥调”；赫鲁晓夫修正主义者污蔑我们的反帝斗争是“空洞的咒文”、“响亮的词句”，邓拓也污蔑反帝斗争是“无济于事”的“伟大的空话”；赫鲁晓夫修正主义者咒骂我们的大跃进是“冒险”、“说大话”、“唯意志论”，说什么大跃进“失败”了，国民经济“垮台”了，邓拓也咒骂大跃进是“胡吹牛皮”、“想入非非”，说什么大跃进“碰得头破血流”，把“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”。这难道能说是巧合吗？
    在一九六一年苏共二十二次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团抛出“三和两全”的现代修正主义纲领，公开攻击坚持马克思列宁主义的政党。同年十二月十七日，邓拓就在《金龟子身上有黄金》这篇黑话文章里大肆吹捧赫鲁晓夫。
    邓拓为什么对“金龟子”这样感兴趣？
    金龟子本来是一种昆虫，邓拓为什么对它这样感兴趣呢？这里有一个不可告人、但又非要告人不可的秘密。
    原来，赫鲁晓夫（хрущев）在俄文里就是“五月金龟子”的意思。邓拓生怕别人看不懂他的黑话，在文章中还特意点出，他所说的金龟子，正是这种“五月金龟子”。邓拓从故纸堆里寻词摘句，对这个“五月金龟子”备加赞扬，说什么“体浑金之萃美兮，色耀日而舒光”。这就是说，在邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子的眼中，赫鲁晓夫这个大叛徒简直是一颗与日月争辉的“大明星”了。
    邓拓反复地宣扬“金龟子身上有黄金”，还说什么“现在我们既然晓得捷克斯洛伐克的科学家做了试验，并且成功了，那末，我们何不也来试它一试呢？”他甚至号召“热心的朋友，在条件允许的时候，注意试验一下，看看结果如何”。
    这些黑话是什么意思呢？
    我们知道，一九六一年十二月，那正是我国由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的背信弃义和连年的自然灾害，国民经济遭到暂时困难的时候。邓拓在这个时候发表这篇黑话，揭穿了说，它的意思无非就是：国民经济困难了，赫鲁晓夫身上有黄金，向赫鲁晓夫要黄金去吧，跟着赫鲁晓夫走吧！这就是邓拓这伙赫鲁晓夫的走卒的黑心。
    邓拓对赫鲁晓夫赞扬备至，对我们的反修斗争当然恨之入骨。在抬出这个“五月金龟子”以前不久，邓拓还恶毒地攻击我们的反修斗争是“自命不凡”的“学生”，“看到入门很容易，就把老师一脚踢开”（《从三到万》）。他辱骂我们伟大的党是“脚上长疮的人”，把我们的反修斗争污蔑为“把脚伸到邻家”，“脚痛也就被推出去了”（《“推事”种种》）。邓拓黑帮真是丧心病狂到了极点。
    借谈药材攻击党对斯大林的正确评价
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团一而再、再而三地大反斯大林，搬尸焚尸，激起了我国广大人民的无比义愤。但是，邓拓黑帮却在一九六二年二月抛出《三七、山漆和田漆》这篇黑话，射出了另一支毒箭。
    大家知道，如何评价斯大林，是如何看待无产阶级专政的历史经验的问题。在这个问题上，我们党同赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团有根本的分歧。针对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团通过大反斯大林来取消无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的阴谋，党中央和毛主席一再指出斯大林是个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他的历史功绩是主要的，错误是次要的。对斯大林这一完全正确的评价，被通俗地比喻为“三七开”，意思就是斯大林功大过小。
    邓拓做为赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的走卒，百般攻击党中央和毛主席对斯大林的评价。他假借谈“三七”这种药材为名，含沙射影地说：“三七……这是根本不可能的，事实也决非如此”，“可见三七的名称确有问题”。尤其恶毒的是，邓拓还说，三七是“最强烈的一种补药，……给年老体衰的病人吃。如果年青强壮的小伙子吃上几口，就要流鼻血，全身发热。”唯恐人家听不明白，他还进一步发挥他的黑话说：“这个道理好比其他事物运动的规律一样，……如果超过了限度，就变成荒谬绝伦，立刻会致病人于死地。所谓‘庸医杀人’往往如此。”大家看，邓拓黑帮同赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团一样，对斯大林，对党中央和毛主席，是抱着多么刻毒的阶级仇恨！
      所谓“历史的重演”指的是什么？
    一九六二年九月九日，中国人民解放军空军部队击落了美帝国主义U—2型间谍飞机。对这一伟大的胜利，全中国和全世界人民都欢欣鼓舞，热烈庆祝。但是，“三家村”黑帮却怀着阴暗的心情，以刻骨的仇恨，马上抛出了《历史会不会重演？》这篇黑话。他们说，苏联一九六○年击落U—2飞机，中国一九六二年又击落U—2飞机，“我们真会觉得历史是在毫发不差的重演。”所谓“历史……的重演”，到底意味着什么呢？他们心里有鬼，不敢直说，就无耻地盗用马克思的话来进行暗示：“一切伟大的世界历史事变和人物，可以说都出现两次”，“第一次是作为悲剧出现，第二次是作为笑剧出现”。
    人们都知道，马克思在《路易·波拿巴的雾月十八日》中所说的这一段话，是嘲讽法国皇帝拿破仑第三的。马克思把拿破仑第一比作悲剧中的英雄，而把企图“重演”拿破仑第一的历史的拿破仑第三比作笑剧中的丑角。邓拓黑帮却盗用马克思的这段话，来恶毒地咒骂打下U—2飞机的中国人民是什么“重演”历史的笑剧中的丑角，而把赫鲁晓夫捧为悲剧中的英雄。
    究竟谁是真正的英雄，谁是真正的小丑呢？
    中国共产党和毛主席领导的伟大的中国人民，一向坚决反对美帝国主义，是举世共知的，是任何人都抹煞不掉的。但是，人们都还记得，正是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，却在苏军打下U—2飞机以后，慌忙寻求美帝国主义的“谅解”，释放U—2飞机的飞行员，借此搞美苏合作，同苏联人民和世界人民的死敌美帝国主义打得火热。这才是真正的丑角演出的真正的丑剧。邓拓黑帮把丑角吹捧成为英雄，那无非说明他们自己是最卑鄙的小丑罢了。
  以谈京戏为名鼓吹向赫鲁晓夫修正主义学习
    一九六三年六月十四日，党中央公布了《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》这一光辉的纲领性文献，中国共产党和毛主席高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团展开了公开论战。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想光芒万丈；赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团在全世界人民面前原形毕露，遭到了可耻的失败。
    这时，死心塌地跟着赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团跑的邓拓黑帮，如坐针毡，急不可耐，再一次出来为赫鲁晓夫修正主义效犬马之劳。这一年十月二十五日，“三家村”黑帮在《前线》抛出了《谈海派》。《谈海派》这篇黑话，表面上谈的是京戏的海派和京派，但是明眼人一看就知道，他们是借着谈京戏来鼓吹赫鲁晓夫修正主义，攻击坚持马克思列宁主义的中国共产党。文章里谈的，是解放前京戏中的京派和海派的优缺点，让京派向海派学习。人们不禁要问，解放已经十多年，到了一九六三年，还要让解放前的“京派”去学习解放前的“海派”，这不是太荒唐了吗？请注意，这里面大有文章。
    “三家村”黑帮说：“许多具有正统思想的京派人物，往往对海派有所非议，例如标新立异、不伦不类、噱头主义、低级色情之类的话，把海派视为邪门歪道，似乎非打倒不可”。这里所谓的“海派”说的是谁呢？不正是那个肆意篡改马克思列宁主义的革命原则，标“三和”之“新”，立“二全”之“异”，到处信口开河，哗众取宠，扮鬼脸，用皮鞋敲桌子，提倡跳阿飞舞的臭名昭彰的赫鲁晓夫吗？坚持马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的，也就是在“三家村”黑话中所谓“具有正统观念”的共产党人，正是要打倒赫鲁晓夫修正主义这种邪门歪道。这不也是明明白白的吗？
    但是，邓拓黑帮却对此“大不以为然”。他们大讲其黑话，把赫鲁晓夫修正主义叫作“海派”，把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想影射为“京派”，说“海派”“有许多优点，很值得我们倡导和学习”，它“从最不保守，最善于适应当代的需要”，“不受正统思想的束缚”。从这些黑话中，我们可以看出，他们对赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团简直到了狂热崇拜的地步。与此同时，他们恶毒地攻击马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是“固步自封的保守思想”，是一个“最大的包袱”。他们甚至狂妄地提出，要“北京”“防止和克服”所谓“正统的、保守的思想”，“向海派学习”。
    邓拓黑帮，你们太放肆了，你们也太不自量了！如果依了你们，“学习”了赫鲁晓夫，我们就要人头落地，亡党亡国，反革命就会在全中国复辟。这绝对办不到，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！你们蓄意同人民为敌，妄想让中国的历史开倒车，把亿万工农大众重新踩在你们的脚下。告诉你们，这是白日做梦！
    事实完全证明，邓拓黑帮同赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团穿的是一条裤子。他们是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团进行反共、反华、反人民、反革命活动的别动队。他们同赫鲁晓夫一样，是钻进共产党和人民政权内部阴谋实现资本主义复辟的野心家。
    邓拓黑帮反党反人民反社会主义，罪恶滔天。全国人民，特别是广大工人和贫农下中农已经说话了，愤怒声讨这一小撮凶恶的阶级敌人。邓拓黑帮想要“安全退走”，那是根本办不到的。邓拓跑不了，“三家村”黑帮跑不了，同他们一起进行反党反社会主义活动、对他们进行包庇掩护的《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》等跑不了，一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神统统跑不了。
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”“五月金龟子”已经被人民扫除掉了，一切反人民的害人虫，也都要被人们揪出来，被人民扫除掉！
