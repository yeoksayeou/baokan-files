    Xinhua News Agency, May 27th—Afghan Ambassador to China, Mohammad Asef Sohail, held a reception at the embassy this afternoon to celebrate Afghanistan's National Day.

    Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Xu Deheng, and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, were invited to attend the reception.

    Ambassador Sohail and Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception. They pointed out that the mutual visits between King Zahir and Chairman Liu Shaoqi in recent years have further consolidated the friendship between Afghanistan and China and advanced the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries to a new stage. Referring to Afghan Prime Minister Maiwandwal's visit to China this autumn at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai, the Ambassador said that this visit will further promote the good relations between Afghanistan and China; Vice Premier Chen Yi said that this will surely make a new contribution to the development of Sino-Afghan friendly relations.

    In his speech, Ambassador Sohail said that since regaining its independence forty-eight years ago, Afghanistan has pursued its traditional policy of neutrality and contributed to lasting world peace. It is friendly with all peace-loving countries and maintains friendship with its neighboring countries with mutual respect. We safeguard the happiness and tranquility of the world in order to build our motherland.

    The Ambassador warmly praised the traditional friendship between the peoples of Afghanistan and China. He said that in history, there have never been any quarrels between Afghanistan and China, and good neighborly relations have always been maintained. We have consistently and unequivocally supported the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Our border issue was resolved through good cooperation and friendly understanding.

    The Ambassador said that His Majesty our King's visit to your great country and the good memories left during the visit have brought us closer. The recent friendly visits by His Excellency Chairman Liu Shaoqi and His Excellency Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi to our country were warmly welcomed by our people and our government, which has further strengthened the friendly relations between us.

    Ambassador Sohail spoke about his recent trip to Shandong with some foreign envoys. He said that the development of your industry, agriculture, and culture is valuable and important. Your country has undergone tremendous changes and significant development, and I congratulate you on these achievements.

    In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the people of China and Afghanistan have a traditional friendship. In recent years, the relations between the two countries have been very good and have developed smoothly. We believe that this is by no means accidental. This is because the two countries have consistently respected each other and treated each other as equals in their interactions; we do what is conducive to the friendship between the people of the two countries, and we do not do what is detrimental to the friendship between the people of the two countries. We have been able to resolve the problems left over from history in the spirit of sincere mutual understanding and mutual accommodation. Friendship based on such a foundation is valuable. We are full of confidence in further consolidating and developing the friendly relations between the two countries.

    He said that not long ago, I accompanied Chairman Liu Shaoqi on a visit to Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, we received a cordial, grand reception and a warm and friendly welcome from His Majesty King Zahir, the Afghan government, and the people. This visit not only further enhanced the friendship between China and Afghanistan but also made a beneficial contribution to promoting the cause of Asian-African solidarity against imperialism.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that through this visit, we deeply felt that the people of Asian and African countries want to live together in friendship and cooperation, to oppose imperialism and safeguard national independence, and to oppose aggression and interference and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. This is an irresistible historical trend. The Chinese government and the Chinese people are willing to stand with the people of Asia and Africa, resolutely oppose imperialism and neo-colonialism, and resolutely support the just struggle of all countries to win and safeguard national independence. Our position is firm and unshakable.

    Also invited to the reception were Han Nianlong, Wang Daohan, Zhang Kai, Ren Yinglun, Zhou Huamin, and other responsible persons from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant departments.

    Envoys from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    大使热烈赞扬阿中两国人民的传统友谊。他说，在历史上阿中之间没有发生过任何争吵，总是保持着良好的睦邻条件。我们一贯地明确支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。我们的边界问题在良好的合作下和友好的谅解中解决了。
    大使说，我们国王陛下对你们伟大国家的访问，和在访问中所留下的良好记忆，更加使我们接近了。最近刘少奇主席阁下和副总理兼外交部长陈毅阁下对我们国家的友好访问，受到了我国人民和我国政府的热烈欢迎，这更加增强了我们之间的友好关系。

    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，中阿两国人民有着传统的友谊。这些年来，两国关系一直很好，发展很顺利。我们认为，这绝不是偶然的。这是由于两国在交往中，一贯互相尊重，平等相待；对有利于两国人民友好的事，我们就做，对不利于两国人民友好的事，我们就不做。对历史上遗留下来的问题，我们能够本着真诚的互谅互让的精神来解决。建立在这样基础上的友好关系是可贵的。我们对进一步巩固和发展两国友好关系充满着信心。
