    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 25th – An article published in the Rawalpindi newspaper *The Construction* on May 25th stated: "The small amount of aid the Soviet Union gives to North Vietnam is aimed at opposing China and maintaining its own political influence there."

    The article, refuting the Soviet-disseminated lie that the Chinese government is obstructing its arms shipments to North Vietnam, pointed out: "This statement by the Soviet Union is completely unfounded." The article pointed out: "If the Soviet Union sincerely wants to help North Vietnam, can it not provide aid materials through other routes besides China? The Soviet Union could easily provide North Vietnam with the weapons it needs by sea. But the Soviet government does not consider doing so at all because the U.S. Seventh Fleet would obstruct Soviet ships."

    The article said that until 1964, under the leadership of Khrushchev, the Soviet Union had been ignoring American aggression in Vietnam, thus leading the U.S. government to believe that the Soviet government could tolerate the most serious American aggression against Vietnam.

    The article said: "Now the Soviet Union has started to provide North Vietnam with some war materials, but (the Soviet Union) avoids getting involved itself." The article continued: "Giving North Vietnam some war materials is one thing; actually confronting American aggression is quite another."

    The article said: "The Soviet government has not rejected the possibility of reaching a compromise with the United States in Vietnam. If the North Vietnamese government were not prepared to confront American aggression at any cost, and if it were frightened by American power, then the United States would have already achieved its goal of seizing Vietnam."

    The article pointed out that, in the eyes of the United States, the socialist Soviet government is not prepared to help the socialist government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Therefore, the U.S. government has massively bombed North Vietnam.

    The article said: "The Soviet Union's Asian policy actually helps the United States, because the two countries' foreign policies have a common trend on the issue of opposing China. The U.S. government is convinced that the Soviet Union will not interfere and is intensifying its war in Vietnam." The article concluded: "The Soviet Union is prepared to avoid war with the United States at any cost. It has already adopted a compromising attitude."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 24th – The Rawalpindi newspaper *The Construction* published an article on May 23rd condemning the Soviet revisionist leading group for colluding with the United States and Indian reactionaries to oppose China.

    The article said: "The Soviet leaders have proven themselves to be hostile to China by supporting India against China. The Soviet Union still persists in this policy." "The Soviet Union insists on further strengthening its relations with India, even though India is not only hostile to China but also consolidating its economic, political and military relations with the United States."

    The article said: "What exactly is the motive for providing war materials to a country like India that is hostile to China? These Soviet weapons will be used against China."

    The article said: Cooperation between the Soviet Union and India is equivalent to indirect cooperation with the Western bloc, especially with the U.S. and British governments. The article said: The U.S. and British governments are going all out to establish an anti-China bloc in Asia. "The Soviet Union has contributed its share to limiting China's political influence, and no matter how the Soviet Union tries to defend itself, it cannot deny this."

    The article said: "The Soviet Union is also giving support to Indonesia, regardless of the right-wing military regime's hostile attitude towards China and the nationwide massacre of members of the Indonesian Communist Party."

    The article pointed out: "Under these circumstances, it is impossible for the Soviet Union and China to adopt a common policy."

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 24th – An editorial in the Hyderabad newspaper *The Indus Times* of West Pakistan on May 23rd stated that the tanks, fighter planes, and missiles that the Soviet Union is shipping to India will put "the peace of the subcontinent into terrible danger." These weapons "will encourage India to adopt a more aggressive and chauvinistic attitude to re-invade Pakistan."

    巴报揭露苏联援越不是为了对付美国侵略
    苏联政府的亚洲政策是联美反华
    竭力利用援助印度来同美英建立反华集团
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十五日电　拉瓦尔品第《建设报》二十五日登载的一篇文章说：“苏联给予越南北方的一点点援助，目的是要反对中国和保持它自己在那里的政治影响。”
    文章在驳斥苏联散布的中国政府阻挠它向越南北方运送武器的谎言时指出：“苏联的这番话是完全毫无根据的。”文章指出：“如果苏联真心诚意地要帮助越南北方，难道除了取道中国之外，就不能通过其他的路线提供援助物资？苏联满可以走海路方便地向越南北方提供它所需要的武器。但是苏联政府一点也不考虑这样做，因为美国第七舰队会对苏联船只进行阻挠。”
    文章说，到一九六四年为止，在赫鲁晓夫领导下，苏联一直无视美国在越南的侵略活动，因此使美国政府相信，苏联政府能够容忍美国对越南的最严重的侵略。
    文章说：“现在苏联开始向越南北方提供一些战争物资了，但是（苏联）避免自己卷入。”文章接着说：“给北越一些战争物资是一回事，实际对付美国侵略又完全是另一回事。”
    文章说：“苏联政府没有拒绝同美国在越南实行妥协的可能性。如果不是北越政府准备不惜任何代价来对付美国的侵略，如果它被美国的力量吓住了，那么美国早已实现它攫取越南的目标了。”
    文章指出，在美国看来，社会主义的苏联政府不准备帮助社会主义的越南民主共和国政府。因此美国政府又大规模地轰炸越南北方。
    文章说：“苏联的亚洲政策实际上帮助了美国，因为两国的对外政策在反华问题上有着共同的趋势。美国政府深信苏联不会加以干涉，便加紧它在越南的战争。”文章最后说：“苏联准备不惜任何代价避免同美国发生战争。它已经采取了妥协的态度。”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第二十四日电　拉瓦尔品第《建设报》二十三日发表文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美国和印度反动派反对中国。
    文章说：“苏联领导通过支持印度反华而证明了自己是敌视中国的。苏联仍然在坚持这样的政策。”“苏联坚持进一步加强它同印度的关系，尽管印度不仅敌视中国，而且在巩固它同美国的经济、政治和军事关系。”
    文章说：“给印度这样一个敌视中国的国家提供战争物资，其动机究竟何在呢？这些苏联的武器是会用来反对中国的。”
    文章说：苏联这样同印度合作等于是同西方集团、特别是同美英政府间接合作。文章说：美英政府全力以赴地在亚洲建立一个反华集团。“苏联对于限制中国的政治影响出了自己的一份力量，这是苏联随便怎样申辩也抵赖不了的。”
    文章说：“苏联还不顾印度尼西亚的右派军人政权对中国采取敌对态度和在全国范围内屠杀印度尼西亚共产党党员而给它支持。”
    文章指出：“在这种情况下，苏联和中国采取共同的政策是不可能的。”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第二十四日电　西巴基斯坦的海得拉巴《印度河时报》二十三日的社论说，苏联运给印度的坦克、战斗机和导弹将把“次大陆的和平投入可怕的危险中”。这些武器“将鼓励印度采取更富有侵略性的和沙文主义的态度来重新侵略巴基斯坦”。
