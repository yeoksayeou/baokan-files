    Your Smoke Screen Cannot Cover the People's Eyes
    《Frontline》 and 《Beijing Daily》 Wear the Same Pants, Sit in the Same Boat, Run the Same Store, Dream the Same Dream, Walk the Same Road as Deng Tuo and His Ilk
    Soldier of a certain unit of the Kunming Troops　Zeng Zhengsong
    After reading the editor's note of 《Frontline》 and 《Beijing Daily》 published by 《Beijing Daily》 on April 16, as a soldier, I have no choice but to pick up my pen and wage a bayonet-to-bayonet struggle against those anti-Party, anti-socialist demons and monsters. 《Frontline》 and 《Beijing Daily》, in their fake criticism, attempted to spread a series of smoke screens.
    The first smoke screen: You used a large amount of space and spared no ink to conduct a fake criticism of Deng Tuo and his ilk. What "distorting the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, advocating the rampant spread of bourgeois ideology," what "completely beautifying the feudal social system," what "borrowing the corpse of feudal ancients to return the soul of the bourgeoisie," and so on, you said a lot, but why didn't you expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist essence of Deng Tuo and his ilk, but instead hung up a sheep's head and sold dog meat? Why didn't you expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist essence of Deng Tuo and his ilk? Why didn't you publish a large number of critical articles by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers? Isn't this an attempt to deceive the people and let Deng Tuo and his ilk get away with it?
    The second smoke screen: In your tendentious subtitles, you said something like "advocating eclecticism, wanting to let so-called 'jacks-of-all-trades shine in our ideological circles'," something like "advocating 'more learning, less criticism,' thinking that 'many people are not deeply learned but like to be picky'," something like "saying that the original purpose of 《Yanshan Evening Talks》 was to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but it is difficult to adapt to the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers," etc. Do you still attempt to confine the problem to the academic scope, not allow the workers, peasants, and soldiers to participate in the battle, cover people's vision, and engage in a big fraud? Tell you: you can't!
    The third smoke screen: Your editor's note put on a weeping face and made a fake self-criticism, wanting to win people's sympathy with this attitude. How can that work! What you said about "relaxing the class struggle on the cultural and academic front," what about "losing your stand or losing vigilance," etc., is all nonsense. You have a tight grip on class struggle, but it is only to wage a struggle against the proletariat; you have not lost your stand, but are standing on the bourgeois stand. Is this your profound self-criticism to correct your past mistakes! Why don't you dare to dig out your ugly thoughts and stinking essence?
    Lifting the lid, it turns out that you and Deng Tuo and his ilk wear the same pants, sit in the same boat, run the same store, dream the same dream, and walk the same road—the anti-Party and anti-socialist road. We solemnly warn 《Frontline》 and 《Beijing Daily》, and Deng Tuo and his ilk: It is your wishful thinking to attempt a bourgeois restoration, to muddle through, to attempt a comeback, to attempt to ride on the heads of the people and act as overlords! It is your daydream, and you have miscalculated! With the wise leadership of our great Party and Chairman Mao, the people's country, socialism, and the three red banners can never be overthrown by you. Your smoke screen has been exposed and can no longer cover the eyes of our soldiers. We must resolutely拔掉 your anti-Party and anti-socialist black flag, and raise the proletariat's red flag higher, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.

### 你们的烟幕弹遮不住人民的眼睛  《前线》和《北京日报》同邓拓之流，穿一条裤，坐一只船，开一个店，做一个梦，走一条路

    你们的烟幕弹遮不住人民的眼睛
    《前线》和《北京日报》同邓拓之流，穿一条裤，坐一只船，开一个店，做一个梦，走一条路
    昆明部队某部战士　曾正松
    看了《北京日报》在四月十六日发表的《前线》《北京日报》的编者按，我作为一个战士，不得不拿起笔来向那些反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，进行刺刀见红的斗争。《前线》《北京日报》在他们的假批判里，企图散布一串烟幕弹。
    第一颗烟幕弹：你们用了大版篇幅，不惜笔墨地对邓拓之流进行了假批判。什么“歪曲党的百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，主张让资产阶级思想泛滥”呀，什么“全面美化封建社会制度”呀，什么“借封建古人之尸，还资产阶级之魂”呀，等等，说了一大堆，可为什么对邓拓之流的反党反社会主义本质不揭露不批判，却在那里挂羊头卖狗肉呢？为什么对邓拓之流反党反社会主义的本质不揭露不批判呢？为什么不大量刊登广大工农兵的批判文章呢？难道这不是想蒙哄人民，让邓拓之流过关么？
    第二颗烟幕弹：在你们有倾向性的小标题里，说什么“提倡兼收并蓄，要让所谓‘杂家在我们的思想界大放异彩’”，什么“主张‘多学习、少批评’，认为‘许多人学问不深而性好挑剔’”，什么“说《燕山夜话》本来的目的是为工农兵服务，但又很难适应工农兵的需要”等等，难道你们还企图把问题束缚在学术范围内，不让工农兵参加战斗，遮盖人们的视线，搞大骗局么？告诉你们：办不到！
    第三颗烟幕弹：你们的编者按语，装出一副哭丧的脸作了一番假检讨，想用这种态度赢得人们的同情。那怎么行呢！你们说什么“放松了文化学术战线上的阶级斗争”，什么“丧失立场或者丧失警惕”，等等，都是胡说。你们对阶级斗争抓得很紧，不过是对无产阶级进行斗争罢了；你们并没有丧失立场，不过是站在资产阶级立场罢了。这难道就是你们痛改前非的深刻检讨吗！你们为什么不敢把自己的丑思想、臭本质挖掘出来呢？
    揭开盖子看，原来你们和邓拓之流，穿一条裤，坐一只船，开一个店，做一个梦，走一条路——反党反社会主义的道路。正告《前线》《北京日报》，正告邓拓之流：妄想资产阶级复辟，蒙混过关，妄想东山再起，妄想骑到人民头上作威作福，是你们白日做梦，是你们打错了算盘！我们有伟大的党和毛主席的英明领导，人民的江山、社会主义、三面红旗，你们永远也骂不倒。你们的烟幕弹揭穿了，再也遮不住我们战士的眼睛了。我们要坚决拔掉你们反党反社会主义的黑旗，更高地举起无产阶级的红旗，将社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
