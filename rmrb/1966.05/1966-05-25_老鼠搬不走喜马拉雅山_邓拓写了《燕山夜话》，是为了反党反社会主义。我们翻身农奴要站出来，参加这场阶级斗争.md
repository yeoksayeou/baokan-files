    Mice Cannot Move the Himalayas
    Deng Tuo wrote "Yanshan Night Talks" to oppose the Party and socialism. We emancipated serfs must stand up and participate in this class struggle.

    I am very angry at the crimes of the Deng Tuo gang against the Party and socialism. We emancipated serfs must stand up and participate in this class struggle, fiercely open fire on these class enemies, and completely smash their black shop!
    Deng Tuo wrote a book called "Yanshan Night Talks," speaking a lot of veiled language in a roundabout way, with the aim of opposing the Party and socialism. Chairman Mao's saying, "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind," is the best explanation of the situation in the world's revolutionary struggle. It has inspired the confidence of the people of the world in opposing imperialism. But Deng Tuo hated this sentence so much that he attacked it as "great empty talk." His words are truly venomous. He wants to demoralize us and prevent the people of the world from carrying out revolutionary struggles. This is daydreaming, and it will never be possible!
    The crimes of Deng Tuo and a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are countless, but the most fundamental one is to viciously curse and attack our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao, wanting to drive our Party off the stage and realize capitalist restoration. This is truly like mice妄想wanting to move the Himalayas, which is laughable.
    The struggle against the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs such as Deng Tuo and Wu Han is a serious class struggle. This struggle is a matter of overall importance. It is a matter of paramount importance relating to the fate and future of our Party and country. We, the million emancipated serfs, cannot ignore or fail to ask about such a major event! Anti-Party and anti-socialist elements妄想want to restore the old system, and we must fight!
    In the old society, the three major lords rode on our necks and used our two ears as stirrups. Now we have been emancipated and become masters of the new society, and we are leaping forward on the beautiful socialist road. This is the result of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Therefore, we emancipated serfs are filled with anger and cannot allow Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and their ilk to slander our great Party and curse our great leader Chairman Mao. We stand up to participate in the struggle, unite with the class brothers of all nationalities across the country to eliminate their anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, smash their black shop, and defeat their black gang!
    We can never forget class struggle. After the rule of the three major lords was overthrown, they never "rested" for a single day, and they tried every means to attack us at all times. In 1964, a small group of reactionary serf-owner class elements in Tibet slandered that "democratic reform had been messed up" and "people's lives had been lowered," but they were thoroughly defeated by our emancipated serfs. The anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk of Deng Tuo and others has the same tone as the reactionary serf-owner elements, and their fate will be the same as the reactionary serf-owner elements, and they will definitely be thoroughly defeated by us along with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country.
    Anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, in the context of our country becoming increasingly strong, always have sweet mouths but venomous hearts. They bully us, and try every means to poison us through articles. We warn the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements: The workers, peasants, and soldiers who have mastered the fate of the country, the million emancipated serfs, have the brightest eyes and the clearest minds, and have the magic weapon to defeat all class enemies—Chairman Mao's writings. No matter what tricks you play, you cannot escape the punishment you deserve.

    老鼠搬不走喜马拉雅山
    邓拓写了《燕山夜话》，是为了反党反社会主义。我们翻身农奴要站出来，参加这场阶级斗争

    对邓拓黑帮反党反社会主义的罪恶，我非常气愤。我们翻身农奴要站出来，参加这场阶级斗争，向这些阶级敌人猛烈开火，把他们的黑店彻底打垮！
    邓拓写了一本《燕山夜话》，转弯抹角地说了一大堆黑话，目的是反党反社会主义。毛主席说的“东风压倒西风”这句话，是对全世界革命斗争形势的最好说明，它鼓舞了全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争信心。但是邓拓却对这句话恨得不得了，攻击这是“伟大的空话”。他的话真毒，他是为了涣散我们的人心，不让世界人民进行革命斗争。这是白日作梦，永远办不到！
    邓拓等一撮反党反社会主义分子的罪行，有千条万条，最根本的一条就是对我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，进行恶毒的咒骂和攻击，想把我们党赶下台，实现资本主义复辟。这真是老鼠妄想搬走喜马拉雅山，使人好笑。
    同邓拓、吴晗等反党反社会主义黑帮的斗争，是一场严重的阶级斗争。这场斗争是关系全局的问题，是关系到我们党和国家命运和前途的头等大事。对这样的大事，我们百万翻身农奴不能不管，不能不问！反党反社会主义分子妄想复辟旧制度，我们必须斗争！
    在旧社会，三大领主骑在我们的脖子上，把我们的两个耳朵当马蹬。现在我们翻了身，作了新社会的主人，并且正在美好的社会主义道路上飞跃前进。这是党和毛主席英明领导的结果。因此，我们翻身农奴满腔怒火，不能听任邓拓、吴晗之流污蔑我们伟大的党，咒骂我们伟大的领袖毛主席。我们挺身参加斗争，要和全国各民族的阶级兄弟一起搞掉他们反党反社会主义的黑线，砸碎他们的黑店，打垮他们的黑帮！
    我们永远也不能忘记阶级斗争。三大领主的统治被推翻以后，他们一天也没有“休息”过，时时刻刻想方设法向我们进攻。一九六四年，西藏一小撮反动农奴主阶级分子污蔑说“民主改革搞糟了”、“人民生活降低了”，结果被我们翻身农奴彻底打垮了。邓拓等反党反社会主义的黑话，腔调完全象反动的农奴主分子，他们的命运也和反动的农奴主分子一样，一定要被我们同全国的工农兵一起彻底打垮。
    反党反社会主义分子，在我们国家日益强大的情况下，总是嘴很甜、心很毒。他们欺负我们，通过文章千方百计地放毒。我们警告反党反社会主义分子：掌握了国家命运的工农兵，翻了身的百万农奴，眼最亮，心最明，有打垮一切阶级敌人的法宝——毛主席著作，不管你们耍什么花招，都逃脱不了应得的惩罚。
