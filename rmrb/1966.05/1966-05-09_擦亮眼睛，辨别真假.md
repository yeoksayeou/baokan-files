    Open Your Eyes and Distinguish Truth from Falsehood
    He Ming
    On April 16th, the "Beijing Daily," under the broad headline "Criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and 'Yanshan Night Talks'," published a batch of materials across three pages, along with an editor's note from "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily." It looked grand and revolutionary, and seemed to be the first to launch a criticism against Deng Tuo and his "Yanshan Night Talks." What is going on here? Class struggle is extremely complex, we must open our eyes and distinguish truth from falsehood, and never be fooled.
    The editor's note of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" said that they wanted to "launch a serious criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and 'Yanshan Night Talks'." Is this true? No, it is false, a fake criticism and real cover-up, fake struggle and real protection.
    Deng Tuo is an anti-Party and anti-socialist so-called "Three-Family Village" village head, and one of the leaders of their gang. However, the editor's note does not mention Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist issues. Wu Han and Liao Mosha have already been exposed, and they have to say that they are anti-Party and anti-socialist; however, according to the editor's note of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily," it seems that Wu Han is the commander, Liao Mosha is the "chief general," and Deng Tuo seems to be a small soldier, who only made mistakes in a muddleheaded way, and is merely a matter of ideological understanding.
    This is deception of the readers.
    The layout of reprinting several articles by Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and Deng Tuo, and the material "What Exactly Does 'Yanshan Night Talks' Propagate?" is carefully compiled under the intention of fake criticism and real cover-up, fake struggle and real protection.
    Deng Tuo's "Treating 'Amnesia'" is the most vicious anti-Party article, in which he viciously insulted our Party. This article has long aroused fierce opposition from some comrades. Therefore, the "Beijing Daily" had to reprint it, but used a small font for the title. May I ask: is this article not "important," or do you want to narrow the target and deceive the readers? Why doesn't your editor's note say a word about this most vicious anti-Party article?
    The material "What Exactly Does 'Yanshan Night Talks' Propagate?" can be summarized in a few words: highlighting the minor, concealing the major, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial, and turning big issues into small ones.
    For example, Deng Tuo's "The Way of Kings and the Way of Hegemons," a historical allegory-laden essay, viciously attacks the dictatorship of the proletariat. Deng Tuo himself pointed out the theme, saying that his discussion of the historical "Way of Kings and the Way of Hegemons" was to allow us to "find experience and lessons." However, "Beijing Daily" listed it under the title "Comprehensive Glorification of the Feudal Social System." Why is this? Is the article "The Way of Kings and the Way of Hegemons" really talking about history? If it is talking about history, and he says that the Way of Kings in history is better than the Way of Hegemons, how is it "Comprehensive Glorification of the Feudal Social System"? The text does not match the title, and the title does not match the text. The reason for this is to "turn Deng Tuo's problem into a small issue."
    Subheadings such as "Saying that the Feudal Ruling Class Also Knew How to Cherish the People's Strength," "The More Ancient the Art, the Better," and "Promoting Feudal Superstition" are all methods of "turning Deng Tuo's problem into a small issue."
    However, at first glance, there are also titles that seem somewhat reasonable, such as "Using the Past to Criticize the Present, Attacking from the Side," but the content extracted here is very little, and the subheadings are especially strange. One subheading is "Satirizing 'Replacing Reality with Fantasy'," and the other is "Ridicule of So-called Boasting." May I ask "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily," why don't you say a word here? Why are you unwilling to label Deng Tuo as anti-Party and anti-socialist? "Satirizing the present," who is being satirized? Who is being "attacked from the side"? Deng Tuo's "using the past to criticize the present, attacking from the side," that is, anti-Party and anti-socialist, has a lot of content, why do you only excerpt so little?
    It is very clear that due to the deepening of the Cultural Revolution, the anti-Party and anti-socialist faces of Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han, and others have been exposed, and "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" hurriedly raised the banner of "Criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and 'Yanshan Night Talks'," and published a batch of materials. The so-called "launching a serious criticism" is false; tightening the position and implementing cover-up is true.
    The editor's note of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" also pretends to say: "In this struggle, the lessons we have learned are very profound." What very profound "lessons"?
    First, in the past "we relaxed the class struggle on the cultural and academic front." Was it "relaxed"? No, in the past few years you released a large number of poisonous weeds, viciously attacking the Party and opposing socialism. Manuscripts criticizing these poisonous weeds were withheld by you and not published, and you tried every means to defend Deng Tuo and others. After the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was launched, you published Xiang Yangsheng, that is, Deng Tuo's, "From 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' to 'Theory of Moral Inheritance'," trying to pull Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political issues into the so-called "pure" academic field of moral inheritance, trying to pull this great debate to the right. Is this relaxing class struggle? No, this is precisely you standing on the side of the bourgeoisie and intensifying the class struggle against the proletariat!
    Second, "This journal and this newspaper published these articles in the past and did not criticize them in time." How easy! Is it just that they were not criticized in time? Not to mention the distant past, until after the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was launched, until today, why haven't your two editorial departments conducted a real criticism of "these articles"? The arsonist says that his mistake was only not putting out the fire in time, who can this deceive?
    Third, "Lost our position or lost our vigilance." Is that so? You have not lost your position, your position is very firm, this position is the position of the bourgeoisie. Saying "lost vigilance" is a bit like it. You misjudged the situation. In the past few years, you thought the "time" had come, and released a large number of poisonous weeds. After the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was launched, you thought you could slip through, so you tried every means to protect the bad guys. In this way, your true colors have also been exposed, which can also be called "loss of vigilance"!
    We cannot but ask "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily," in recent years, have you been the positions of the proletariat or the positions of the bourgeoisie? Are you tools of the dictatorship of the proletariat, or tools for promoting the restoration of capitalism? Where exactly are you going?
    I have something to say, I have to say it; if I said something wrong, please "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" criticize and correct me.

    擦亮眼睛，辨别真假
    何明
    《北京日报》在四月十六日，以三版的篇幅，在《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》这个通栏大标题之下，发表了一批材料，并发表了《前线》《北京日报》的编者按。看样子轰轰烈烈，非常革命，并且好象是首先发难，对邓拓和他的《燕山夜话》进行批判。这是怎么一回事呢？阶级斗争是十分复杂的，我们必须擦亮眼睛，辨别真假，千万不要上当。
    《前线》《北京日报》的编者按说，要“对‘三家村’和《燕山夜话》展开严肃的批判”。这是真的吗？不是，这是假的，是假批判、真掩护，假斗争、真包庇。
    邓拓是反党反社会主义的所谓“三家村”的一名村长，是他们一伙的一个头头。可是，编者按却不提邓拓反党反社会主义的问题。吴晗和廖沫沙早已被揭露了，不得不说他们是反党反社会主义；然而照《前线》和《北京日报》的编者按说来，好象吴晗是主帅，廖沫沙是“主将”，而邓拓似乎是一名小卒，他不过是稀里糊涂的犯了错误，不过是思想认识问题。
    这是对读者的欺骗。
    重新发表吴晗、廖沫沙和邓拓几篇文章的版面，和《〈燕山夜话〉究竟宣扬了什么？》这个材料，就是在假批判、真掩护，假斗争、真包庇的意图下，精心编制的。
    邓拓的《专治“健忘症”》，是一篇最恶毒的反党文章，在这篇文章里，他恶毒地辱骂了我们的党。这篇文章早已引起一些同志的激烈反对。所以，《北京日报》不得不重新发表它，可是却用小号字作标题。请问：是这篇文章不“重要”呢，还是你们要缩小目标，瞒哄读者呢？你们的按语，为什么对这篇最恶毒的反党文章，一句话也不说呢？
    《〈燕山夜话〉究竟宣扬了什么？》这个材料，可以用几句话来概括，这就是：突出次要，掩盖主要，避重就轻，大事化小。
    例如邓拓的《王道和霸道》这篇借古讽今的杂文，它是恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政的。邓拓自己也点了题，他讲什么历史上的“王道和霸道”，是要我们“找出经验教训”的。可是，《北京日报》却把它列到《全面美化封建社会制度》这个标题之下。这是为了什么呢？难道《王道和霸道》这篇文章是真正在讲历史吗？如果是讲历史，他说历史上王道比霸道好，怎么就是《全面美化封建社会制度》呢？文不对题，题不对文。所以如此，就是要把邓拓的问题“大事化小”。
    《说封建统治阶级也知道爱惜民力》《艺术越古越好》《宣传封建迷信》之类的小标题，也都是把邓拓的问题“大事化小”的手法。
    不过，乍一看也有象点样子的标题，例如《以古讽今，旁敲侧击》，可是这里摘的内容却很少，而小标题尤其奇怪，小标题一个是《讽刺“以空想代替现实”》，另一个是《讥讽所谓吹牛皮》。请问《前线》和《北京日报》，在这里你们为什么一句话也不说呢？为什么不肯标出邓拓反党反社会主义呢？“讽今”，是讽的谁呢？“侧击”又是击的谁呢？邓拓的“以古讽今，旁敲侧击”，即反党反社会主义，其内容多得很，为什么你们只摘录那么一点点呢？
    很清楚，由于文化革命的深入，邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗等人反党反社会主义的面目暴露了，《前线》和《北京日报》才匆匆忙忙地扯起《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》这面旗子，发表一批材料。所谓“展开严肃的批判”是假的；收紧阵地，实行掩护，才是真的。
    《前线》和《北京日报》的编者按语，还装模作样地说：“在这一场斗争中，我们得到的教训是很深刻的。”什么很深刻的“教训”？
    一曰：过去“我们放松了文化学术战线上的阶级斗争”。是“放松”了吗？不是，你们在前几年里放出了大量毒草，恶毒地攻击党，反对社会主义，批判这些毒草的稿件被你们扣压起来，不予发表，并且百般为邓拓等人辩护，在对《海瑞罢官》展开批判以后，你们又发表向阳生即邓拓的《从〈海瑞罢官〉谈到“道德继承论”》，力图把吴晗的反党反社会主义的政治问题拉到所谓道德继承的“纯粹”学术领域中，力图把这场大辩论拉向右转，难道这是放松了阶级斗争吗？不是，这正是你们站在资产阶级方面对无产阶级加紧进行阶级斗争！
    二曰：“本刊、本报过去发表了这些文章又没有及时地批判”。好轻松！只是没有及时批判吗？远的不说，直到对《海瑞罢官》的批判展开以后，直到今天，你们两个编辑部为什么还不对“这些文章”进行真正的批判呢？纵火者，事后说他的过错只是没有及时救火，这能骗得了谁呢？
    三曰：“丧失立场或者丧失警惕”。是这样吗？你们并没有丧失立场，你们的立场很坚定，这立场就是资产阶级的立场。说“丧失警惕”倒有点象。你们错误的估计了形势，在前几年你们以为“时机”已到，大放毒草，在对《海瑞罢官》展开批判以后，你们以为可以滑过去，于是想尽法子包庇坏人。这样一来，你们的真面目，也就暴露了，这也可以叫作“丧失警惕”吧！
    我们不能不问《前线》和《北京日报》，近几年来，你们究竟是无产阶级的阵地，还是资产阶级的阵地？你们是无产阶级专政的工具，还是宣扬复辟资本主义的工具？你们究竟要走到那里去？
    心里有话，不得不说；说错的地方，请《前线》和《北京日报》批评、指正。
