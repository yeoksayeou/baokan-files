    Deng Tuo insulted our Party for "replacing reality with empty dreams" and slandered our Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "telling big lies." We absolutely cannot tolerate these vicious slanders.
    The achievements of the Great Leap Forward are enormous and cannot be slandered by anyone! Deng Tuo and his ilk, open your eyes and look! Our Jiangnan Shipyard is a century-old factory. For more than eighty years before liberation, it was a complete mess, only able to repair some dilapidated ships. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, this century-old factory of ours quickly developed from repairing ships to building them ourselves. When the Great Leap Forward began in 1958, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, liberated our minds, broke down superstitions, and built the "Peace No. 28" 5,000-ton ocean freighter at high speed. Not only 5,000-ton ships, but also larger tonnage giant ships, we have now built. Is this not a fact, but "bragging" and "telling big lies"?
    Look again at the 12,000-ton hydraulic press designed and manufactured independently by our country! At that time, we had no data, no experience, no experts, no large equipment, and no large castings and forgings. In the manufacturing process, we encountered many difficulties. However, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction and encouraged by the Great Leap Forward, we relied on our own strength, overcame thousands of difficulties, and finally built it. After being tempered by the Great Leap Forward, an ordinary welder like me, who had no education, also mastered new technologies such as arc welding, submerged arc automatic welding, gas shielded welding, and electroslag welding, and presented a paper to representatives from dozens of countries at the Beijing Science Symposium. Is this not a fact, but "bragging" and "telling big lies"?
    The great achievements of our Great Leap Forward not only gave great encouragement to the people of the whole country, but also received enthusiastic praise from international friends. I heard many foreign friends praise our Great Leap Forward when I went abroad twice. A foreign friend who had visited our country said to me: "China's construction speed is truly remarkable. Although our foundation is better than yours, we are falling behind you. Your leaders are truly great!" Foreign friends can see the great achievements of our Great Leap Forward, so why do Deng Tuo and his gang close their eyes to the facts, talk nonsense, and reverse black and white?
    Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" was thrown out during the period from 1961 to 1962. We can recall that at that time we were suffering from three consecutive years of natural disasters, the imperialists took the opportunity to bully us, and the revisionists made things difficult for us in every possible way. Khrushchev's modern revisionists not only withdrew experts and tore up contracts, adding many difficulties for us, but also scolded our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," an "adventurous plan," and "voluntarism." Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements were precisely coordinating with the imperialists and modern revisionists to shoot arrows at us from the dark. This is a sharp class struggle. We workers are determined to fight this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements under the leadership of the Party. Anyone who wants to deny our achievements will be met with a head-on blow, and demons and monsters must not hinder our progress.

    邓拓为什么要如此仇视大跃进
    谁要否定我们的成就，就一定要遭到我们的迎头痛击。牛鬼蛇神决不能阻挡我们前进的步伐
    全国人民代表大会代表、上海江南造船厂工人工程师　唐应斌
    邓拓辱骂我们党是“以空想代替现实”，污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”。我们对这些恶毒的诽谤，绝对不能容忍。
    大跃进的成就是巨大的，是任何人都污蔑不了的！邓拓之流，你们睁开眼睛看看吧！我们江南造船厂是一个百年的老厂，解放前的八十多年，一直是个烂摊子，只能修修补补一些破烂船。解放后，在党的领导下，我们这个百年老厂，从修船到自己能造船，很快发展起来。一九五八年大跃进开始时，我们遵照毛主席的教导，解放思想，破除迷信，高速度地建成了“和平二十八号”五千吨远洋货轮。不仅是五千吨的，吨位更大的巨轮，我们现在也造出来了。这难道不是事实，而是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？
    再看看我国自行设计、自行制造的一万二千吨水压机！当时我们一无资料、二无经验、三无专家、四无大设备、五无大的铸锻件，在制造过程中，曾经遇到了很多的困难。可是，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，我们依靠自己的力量，克服千艰万难，终于把它造出来了。经过大跃进的锻炼，象我这样一个没有文化的普通电焊工人，还掌握了电弧焊、埋弧自动焊、气体保护焊以及电渣焊等新技术，并在北京科学讨论会上，向几十个国家的代表宣读了论文。这难道不是事实，而是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？
    我们大跃进的伟大成就，不但给了全国人民很大的鼓舞，而且受到了国际友人的热烈赞扬。我两次出国，就听到许多外国朋友称赞我们的大跃进。有位来我国访问过的外国朋友对我说：“中国的建设速度真了不起，我们基础虽然比你们好，但落在你们后面了。你们的领导人真伟大！”外国朋友都能看到我们大跃进的伟大成就，为什么邓拓这伙人反而闭眼不看事实，胡说八道，颠倒黑白呢？
    邓拓的《燕山夜话》，是在一九六一年到一九六二年这段时间里抛出来的。我们可以回想一下，当时我们正遭受连续三年自然灾害，帝国主义乘机欺侮我们，修正主义百般刁难我们。赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者不仅撤退专家、撕毁合同，给我们增加了许多困难，而且骂我们大跃进是“说大话”，是“冒险的计划”，是“唯意志论”。邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子正是配合帝国主义和现代修正主义来向我们放暗箭。这是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。我们工人坚决要在党的领导下，同这一帮反党反社会主义分子斗争。谁要否定我们的成就，谁就一定要遭到我们的迎头痛击，牛鬼蛇神决不能阻挡我们前进的步伐。
