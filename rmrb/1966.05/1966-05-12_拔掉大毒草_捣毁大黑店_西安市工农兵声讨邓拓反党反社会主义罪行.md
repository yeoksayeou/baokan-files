    *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* have been frantically implementing a right-leaning opportunist, namely revisionist, line, becoming Deng Tuo's gang's position for attacking the Party and socialism, and have been condemned by people from all over the country. In recent days, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Xi'an area of Shaanxi Province have held discussion meetings one after another, angrily denouncing Deng Tuo's crimes against the Party and socialism. The following is a summary of the speeches of workers, peasants, and soldiers at a discussion meeting on May 8.

        Expose their various conspiracies

    Liu Mingde, production group leader of the Xi'an High-Voltage Electromagnetic Factory, said: For a long time, *Qianxian*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News* have been selling a large number of Deng Tuo's and others' anti-Party and anti-socialist black goods. These newspapers and periodicals have long become the mouthpieces of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Under the situation of the in-depth development of the socialist cultural revolution, seeing that the situation was not good, they hurriedly brought out a lot of rotten goods to decorate the facade. *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* have consistently followed the instructions of their shopkeeper Deng Tuo in running things. Deng Tuo's Thirty-Six Stratagems are precisely a set of methods played by *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily*. In the past, they sold Deng Tuo's and others' black goods by adopting the means of "secretly transporting goods," poisoning and killing people; today, they are using the guise of "criticism" and using the trick of "bluffing" to cover up the retreat of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Deng Tuo is clearly the shopkeeper of their black shop, but they dress him up as a shop assistant and bring out Wu Han to act as the shopkeeper. Isn't this precisely the trick of "escaping like a cicada shedding its skin" and "the guest becoming the host"? However, the eyes of the people are discerning, and if they want to run away with their black shop shopkeeper, it will not work!
    Tian Wenzhi, production team leader of Xiliu Commune, Chang'an County, said: After the anti-Party and anti-socialist face of Deng Tuo, the pseudo-village head of this "Three-Family Village," was exposed, *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* hurried out, pretending to criticize, helping in a small way but harming in a big way, trying to help Deng Tuo pass the test. But no matter whether you use "deceiving the heavens and crossing the sea," "bitter-flesh stratagem," or any other conspiracy, you will always not escape the eyes of the people. All class enemies have their common points, some in front of the stage, and some behind the scenes. Whether in front of the stage or behind the scenes, we must drag you out!

        It is not allowed to attack our great Party

    Zou Junren, a five-good soldier from a certain air force unit stationed in Shaanxi, said: After reading the exposure by *Liberation Army Daily* and others of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, our people's soldiers are very indignant. We want to shout loudly: You anti-Party and anti-socialist guys are not allowed to attack our great Party. If you want a martial fight, we can completely beat you to pieces; if you want a verbal fight, we will thoroughly tear off your painted skin. Deng Tuo viciously attacked our Party in this pile of poisonous weeds, *Yanshan Evening Talks*. He used Zhuge Liang to insinuate the Party Central Committee, falsely accusing the Party Central Committee of "lacking foresight." The Communist Party of China, headed by Chairman Mao and proficient in Marxism-Leninism, has always had scientific foresight. Deng Tuo wants to use slander to change this iron fact, which is really "the illusion of a fool"! In *Remnants of the Eight-Legged Essay*, Deng Tuo falsely accused our work summary of being "more annoying than the old-style eight-legged essay." What does he hate? He hates us talking about achievements and hates us expressing confidence in overcoming difficulties. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have made unprecedented achievements in revolution and construction. Why can't we talk about them? When encountering temporary difficulties, everyone has full confidence in overcoming difficulties. Why can't we express it? This poisonous weed he released in 1961 can only show that Deng Tuo was "robbing a burning house" when we encountered a little temporary difficulty, vainly attempting to erase the great achievements of our socialist construction.
    Zou Gengfu, a poor peasant association member of the Xiwei Brigade, Duqu Commune, Chang'an County, said: Since liberation sixteen years ago, our great Party has led the people of the whole country to build a strong socialist country on the dilapidated stall left over from the old society. However, Deng Tuo, the ringleader of this anti-Party and anti-socialist group, ran out and arrogantly clamored for our Party to "publicly admit mistakes." We want to question Deng Tuo, what "mistakes" do you want our Party to "publicly admit"? Who do you want us to "admit mistakes" to? It is very clear that the "mistakes" you are talking about are precisely the great achievements our Party has made in leading the masses of the people in the cause of socialist revolution and construction. This exposes your true face of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. You want us to "admit mistakes" to you a bunch of monsters and demons. Your wishful thinking is completely wrong. Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? We know clearly in our hearts.
    赗 Fengqin, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's writings from a certain air force unit stationed in Shaanxi, said: Deng Tuo's poisonous weed *Three Kinds of Zhuge Liang* is openly attacking the Party Central Committee in the image of Zhuge Liang. He said that "some people not only have no good feelings towards Zhuge Liang, but also have very bad feelings." Who has good feelings towards our Party and who has bad feelings towards our Party? What class speaks what words. Deng Tuo, a small group of bad guys who dream of restoring capitalism, of course have "very bad feelings" towards our Party. However, more than 95% of the people in the country warmly support the Party. Deng Tuo, you want to sow discord between the Party and the masses of the people. It is completely wishful thinking! You use various poisonous tricks to attack our Party. We must overthrow and discredit you anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

        It is wishful thinking to restore capitalism

    Su Jinhe, the driver of the Xi'an Locomotive Depot, said: The workers in our locomotive depot were very angry when they saw the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of Deng Tuo and other small groups in the newspaper. Deng Tuo, the shopkeeper of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, viciously attacked our Party's general line, saying that the Great Leap Forward was "bragging," "talking big," "wishful thinking," "replacing reality with fantasy," and "destroying all the possessions of an egg," etc., which is completely nonsense. Since 1958, under the glorious light of the Party's general line, the broad masses of workers in our country have achieved an all-round leap forward in more, faster, better, and more economical ways. Isn't this reality but fantasy? Taking our railway transportation system as an example, in the past, the wheel rims of trains were all imported from the Soviet Union. Khrushchev revisionists wanted to use economic blockade to bring us down. However, our Chinese workers worked hard and created wheel rims of better quality. Is this also "bragging" and "talking big"? Deng Tuo wants to turn the wheel of history backwards and restore capitalism. This is daydreaming in broad daylight! Our workers will always listen to the Party and follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao to drive the locomotive of history towards communism. All monsters and demons that hinder the progress of history will be crushed to pieces under the iron wheels of history.
    Niu Wenhui, a member of the Zhang Niu Brigade of Ganhe Commune, Chang'an County, said: Look! How insidious and vicious Deng Tuo is. He compares our Party to Genghis Khan, the emperor of the feudal empire, and uses Qiu Chuji's words to insinuate that the Party should "respect heaven and cherish the people" and "purify the heart and reduce desires." From the day it was founded, our Party has been making revolution for the suffering working people and fighting for the working people all over the world. Deng Tuo pretends to sympathize with the working people, talking about "pleading for the people's lives" and "caring for labor power." In reality, he is "pleading for the lives" of right-leaning opportunists. This also shows that Deng Tuo is an accomplice of imperialism and a pawn of revisionism. We will never allow him to use the past to criticize the present and oppose our great Party.
    Fan Xingjia, a worker at the Xi'an Nanchang Composite Material Factory, said: In some articles such as *The Theory of Caring for Labor Power*, *Ode to Bees and Beekeeping*, Deng Tuo falsely accused our Party of "not cherishing people's power" and directly attacked the Great Leap Forward. This is maliciously provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses. In order to quickly build our country into a great socialist power, our workers wish they could use one day as two days. However, the Party is always concerned about our lives and repeatedly emphasizes the need to combine work and rest. Deng Tuo, you want to win over the working class to follow you guys who are bad from head to toe. This is wishful thinking!

        Defeat the anti-Party "backbone"

    Wang Liankun, a five-good soldier from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi, said: In the article *Correcting <Notes on a Tour of Treasure Island>*, Deng Tuo said that after Su Dongpo was "demoted," the "authorities" restricted his activities and did not write the words "the edge of the sky", and shouted, "Never listen to hearsay," and "Especially should not want to take for granted unreliable materials chaotic propaganda." Deng Tuo is supporting and protesting for the right opportunist elements who have been overthrown by the people. The right opportunist elements' attack has been driven back by us; the attack of Deng Tuo's small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, we must also drive back!
    Miao Xingui, a soldier from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shaanxi, said: Deng Tuo's *People are Poor but Their Aspirations are Not* written on November 19, 1961 and *Can the Eagle Compare to the Hero?* written on June 14, 1962, were cheering for the right-leaning opportunists, asking them to attack the Party. In the former article, Deng Tuo praised the "backbone" of the right-leaning opportunists and asked them to "cope" with the surrounding "evil forces"; in the latter article, he ridiculed the "rabbit hawk or sparrow hawk" that "listens to orders very much" and praised the mountain eagle that "specializes in grabbing big birds and does not bother with small sparrows" as "indeed having heroic spirit." These vicious black words are attacking the Party, attacking socialism, attacking the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cheering for the right-leaning opportunists. We, the people's soldiers, listen to the Party the most, listen to Chairman Mao the most, and are the Party's most obedient tools. He wants the right-leaning opportunists to have the "backbone" to oppose the Party. We must use the hard-boned spirit of the proletariat to defeat their anti-Party and anti-socialist attacks!

### 拔掉大毒草　捣毁大黑店  西安市工农兵声讨邓拓反党反社会主义罪行

    拔掉大毒草　捣毁大黑店
    西安市工农兵声讨邓拓反党反社会主义罪行
    《前线》和《北京日报》猖狂地执行了一条右倾机会主义即修正主义的路线，成为邓拓一伙的向党和社会主义进攻的阵地，受到了各地人民的谴责。连日来，陕西省西安地区的广大工农兵群众纷纷举行座谈会，愤怒声讨邓拓反党反社会主义的罪行。下面是五月八日的一次座谈会上工农兵群众的发言纪要。
        戳穿他们的种种诡计
    西安高压电磁厂生产组长刘明德说：《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》长期以来大量推销邓拓等人反党反社会主义黑货。这些报刊早已变成了反党反社会主义分子的喉舌。在社会主义文化大革命深入发展的形势下，他们看着风头不妙，急急忙忙地搬出一大堆烂货来装点门面。《前线》和《北京日报》是一贯地遵照他们的掌柜邓拓的授意办事的。邓拓的三十六计，也正是《前线》和《北京日报》玩弄的一套手法。过去，他们推销邓拓等人的黑货，采取“暗渡陈仓”的手段，放毒杀人；今天，他们又打着“批判”的幌子，施用“虚张声势”的诡计，掩护反党反社会主义分子退却。邓拓明明是他们黑店的掌柜，他们却把他打扮成一个小伙计，而把吴晗搬出来充当掌柜，这不正是“金蝉脱壳”、“反客为主”的诡计吗？但是，人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们要想和他们的黑店掌柜一起溜之大吉，这办不到！
    长安县细柳公社生产大队长田文治说：在邓拓这个“三家村”伪村长反党反社会主义的面目暴露出来以后，《前线》和《北京日报》赶忙出来，装着批判的样子，小骂大帮忙，企图掩护邓拓过关。但是不论你们用“瞒天过海”也好，“苦肉计”也好，还是用其他什么阴谋诡计也好，你们总是逃不脱人民的眼睛的。一切阶级敌人总有他的共同点，有在幕前的，又有在幕后的。不论是在幕前的还是在幕后的，我们一定要把你们揪出来！
        不许攻击我们伟大的党
    驻陕空军某部五好战士邹俊人说：看了《解放军报》等揭发的邓拓反党反社会主义的罪行，我们人民战士非常愤慨。我们要大喝一声：不许你们这帮反党反社会主义的家伙，攻击我们伟大的党。你们要武打，我们完全可以把你们打得稀巴烂；你们要文斗，我们就彻底撕下你们的画皮。邓拓在《燕山夜话》这堆毒草中，恶毒地攻击我们党。他用诸葛亮影射党中央，诬蔑党中央“缺乏先见之明”。以毛主席为首的、精通马克思列宁主义的中国共产党，从来都有科学的预见。邓拓想用诬蔑改变这一铁的事实，真是“愚夫的幻想”！邓拓在《八股余孽》中，诬蔑我们的工作总结“比旧式的八股文还要讨厌”。他讨厌什么呢？讨厌我们谈成绩，讨厌我们表示克服困难的信心。中国人民在党中央、毛主席领导下，搞革命，搞建设，成绩是空前未有的，为什么不能讲呢？遇到暂时困难的时候，大家有战胜困难的充分信心，为什么不可以表示呢？他在一九六一年放出的这株毒草，只能说明邓拓是在我们遇到一点暂时困难的时候“趁火打劫”，妄图抹煞我国社会主义建设的伟大成绩。
    长安县杜曲公社西韦大队贫协委员邹耕夫说：解放十六年来，我们伟大的党领导全国人民，在旧社会遗留下的破烂摊子上建设起一个强大的社会主义国家。可是，邓拓这个反党反社会主义的头目，却跑出来狂妄地叫嚷要我们党“公开承认错误”。我们要质问邓拓，你要我们党“公开承认”什么“错误”呢？你要我们向谁“承认错误”呢？很明白，你所说的“错误”，正是我们党领导人民群众在社会主义革命和建设事业中所取得的伟大成绩。这正暴露了你的反党反社会主义的真面目。你要我们向你们这一伙牛鬼蛇神“承认错误”，你的如意算盘完全打错了。谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？我们心里是清清楚楚的。
    驻陕空军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子赗凤琴说：邓拓的《三种诸葛亮》这棵毒草，是借诸葛亮的形象明目张胆地攻击党中央的。他说什么“有的人对于诸葛亮不但没有好感，反而很有恶感”。谁对我们的党有好感，谁对我们的党有恶感呢？什么阶级说什么话。邓拓你们这一小撮梦想复辟资本主义的坏家伙，当然对我们的党“很有恶感”。可是，全国百分之九十五以上的人民，都热烈地拥护党。邓拓，你想挑拨党和人民群众的关系，完全是痴心妄想！你们采用各种毒计攻击我们的党，我们一定要把你们这伙反党反社会主义分子斗倒斗臭。
        要复辟资本主义是妄想
    西安机务段司机长苏金河说：我们机务段的工人在报纸上看到了邓拓等一小撮人反党反社会主义的言论，十分气愤。邓拓，这个“三家村”黑店的掌柜，恶毒攻击我们党的总路线、大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”、“想入非非”、“用空想代替现实”、“把一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”等等，完全是胡说八道。一九五八年以来，我国广大职工在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了多快好省全面跃进，这难道不是现实而是空想吗？就拿我们铁路交通系统来说，过去火车车轮的轮箍都是靠苏联进口的，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者想用经济封锁搞垮我们。可是，我们中国工人奋发图强造出了质量更好的轮箍，这难道也是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？邓拓想让历史车轮倒转，复辟资本主义，这是大白天作梦！我们工人一定永远听党的话，按毛主席指引的方向，把历史的火车头开向共产主义。一切阻碍历史前进的牛鬼蛇神，都将在历史的铁轮下被压得粉身碎骨。
    长安县甘河公社张牛大队社员牛雯慧说：大家看！邓拓是多么阴险毒辣，他把我们的党比成封建帝国的皇帝成吉思汗，并用丘处机的话含沙射影地要党“敬天爱民”、“清心寡欲”。我们的党从成立那天起，就是为受苦受难的劳动人民闹革命的，为全世界的劳苦人民而战斗的。邓拓装出同情劳动人民的样子，讲什么“为民请命”呀，“爱护劳动力”呀，实际上是为右倾机会主义分子“请命”。这也说明邓拓是帝国主义的帮凶，修正主义的走卒。我们决不允许他借古骂今，反对我们伟大的党。
    西安南昌综合材料厂工人范兴加说：邓拓在《爱护劳动力的学说》、《咏蜂和养蜂》一些文章中，诬蔑我们的党“不爱惜民力”，直接攻击大跃进。这是恶意挑拨党和群众的关系。为了迅速把我国建成为社会主义伟大强国，我们工人恨不得把一天当两天用，倒是党处处关心我们的生活，一再强调要劳逸结合。邓拓，你想拉拢工人阶级跟着你们这些从头到尾都坏透了的家伙走，这是妄想！
        打垮反党的“骨气”
    解放军驻陕某部五好战士王连坤说：邓拓在《替〈宝岛游记〉更正》这篇文章中，说苏东坡在“被贬谪”以后，“有司”限制他的活动，并没有去写“天涯”二字，并且大喊大叫“千万不要道听途说”，
  “尤其不应该想当然地把不可靠的材料乱作宣传”。邓拓是在替被人民赶下台的右倾机会主义分子撑腰，鸣不平。右倾机会主义分子的进攻，被我们打退了；邓拓一小撮反党反社会主义分子的进攻，我们也一定要打退它！
    解放军驻陕某部战士苗新贵说：一九六一年十一月十九日邓拓写的《人穷志不穷》和一九六二年六月十四日写的《老鹰能比英雄吗？》，就是在为右倾机会主义分子摇旗呐喊，要他们向党进攻。邓拓在前一篇文章里，吹捧右倾机会主义分子的“骨气”，要他们“应付”周围的“恶势力”；在后一篇文章里，又嘲骂“极听人命令”的“兔鹰或雀鹰”，赞美“专攫大鸟，不屑于小雀”的山鹰，“确有英雄气概”。这些恶毒的黑话正是攻击党，攻击社会主义，攻击工农兵群众，为右倾机会主义分子打气。我们人民战士最听党的话，最听毛主席的话，是党的最驯服的工具。他要右倾机会主义分子有反党的“骨气”，我们就要用无产阶级的硬骨头精神，打垮他们反党反社会主义的进攻！
