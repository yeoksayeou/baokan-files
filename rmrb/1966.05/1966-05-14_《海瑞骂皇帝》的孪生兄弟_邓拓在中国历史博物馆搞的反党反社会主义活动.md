    The Twin Brother of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor"
    Deng Tuo's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Activities at the Chinese History Museum
    Chinese History Museum　Wang Hongxiang
    Wu Han hurled out the notoriously sinful "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" in the newspapers, while Deng Tuo displayed "Hai Rui Exposes the Dark Rule of the Ming Dynasty" in the Chinese History Museum. Two evil winds were stirred up through a black line.
    After Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist true colors were revealed, it greatly brightened our eyes, making us suddenly realize that there was also a twin brother of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" that must be thoroughly investigated immediately. This is "Hai Rui Exposes the Dark Rule of the Ming Dynasty" in the exhibition of the Chinese History Museum.
    In the summer of 1959, just as the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, were holding high the three red flags, striding forward, fiercely attacking capitalism and the remaining feudal forces, and bravely advancing along the socialist road, the anti-Party and anti-socialist element Wu Han, with deep-seated hatred, colluded with Khrushchev's modern revisionism and right-leaning opportunists within the Party, launched a frantic attack on our great leader and our great Party, and hurled out the notoriously sinful "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." At exactly this time, "Hai Rui Exposes the Dark Rule of the Ming Dynasty" also appeared in the exhibition of the History Museum in front of Tiananmen. What a coincidence! How alike! Is this really an accidental coincidence? No, absolutely not. After our investigation, it turned out that this was a butcher knife, personally forged by Deng Tuo, to chop at our Party and at our socialist system. This was a black deal, long before the opening of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, in which Deng Tuo, Wu Han and their gang colluded with each other and cooperated to launch a frantic attack on the Party and on socialism.
    The matter is like this: From October 1958 to October 1959, Deng Tuo seized the position of the main person in charge of the leading group of the Chinese History Museum. Originally, until mid-May 1959, the exhibition outline, which had been revised six times, did not mention Hai Rui at all. Suddenly, not long before Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" was published, on May 12, another member of the museum construction leading group instructed: "Hai Rui should be shown." As a result, Hai Rui, the loyal slave of the landlord class and smiling tiger who slaughtered the people, made a grand appearance in the historical exhibition. The initial title was "Hai Rui, Who Was Not Afraid of the Powerful and Established the Single Whip Method." In addition, a companion was brought out—"Zhang Juzheng, Who Implemented the Single Whip Method." Obviously, such an exhibition technique was far from Deng Tuo's liking. First, focusing on Hai Rui from the perspective of the Single Whip Method could not express Deng Tuo's ulterior motives; second, Hai Rui and Zhang Juzheng were juxtaposed, and Hai Rui could not be highlighted; third, forcibly inserting Hai Rui into the background of the "late Ming peasant uprising" was indeed irrelevant if there was no appropriate explanation, and it was easy to reveal their true colors. Therefore, Deng Tuo personally instructed:
     "Attention!
    In the unit of the great peasant uprising,
    inserting Hai Rui and Zhang Juzheng
    makes it difficult for the masses to understand the relationship,
    is it possible to consider using appropriate means in the title
    to express the relationship between these themes?"
    After Deng Tuo's "instruction," Zhang Juzheng was removed, Hai Rui was highlighted, and the title? "Hai Rui Who Exposed the Darkness and Struggled Against the Emperor."
    Look, isn't this a reprint of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor"? In this way, naturally "the masses" "easily understand." Understand what? Understand that Deng Tuo and Wu Han unanimously and viciously cursed our great Party and viciously cursed our beloved leader Chairman Mao. Their hideous faces and vicious intentions were completely exposed.
    However, Deng Tuo was, after all, a "talented person" with "wisdom." Although such a title might vent their deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, it was too blatant. Wouldn't the criminal activities of this gang of blackguards be exposed quickly?
    Therefore, under Deng Tuo's instructions, it was changed to "From Hai Rui's Admonitions, See the Dark Rule of the Ming Dynasty." It was more hidden, but too "pedantic." Moreover, Deng Tuo's purpose was not to expose the dark rule of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, after Deng Tuo exhausted his efforts, he personally revised it to:
    "Hai Rui Exposes the Dark Rule of the Ming Dynasty!"
    Afterward, Deng Tuo brought his collection of Hai Rui's "name cards," and Wu Han also excitedly sent a roll of Hai Rui's fake portraits in his hands. In this way, the twin brother of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" appeared grandly in the exhibition of the Chinese History Museum in front of Tiananmen.
    What a "Hai Rui Exposes the Dark Rule of the Ming Dynasty"! This is clearly an attack on our Party and a curse on our socialism by anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Moreover, Deng Tuo tried his best to insert it before the great peasant uprising in the late Ming Dynasty. In fact, this is a call for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to rise up and engage in counter-revolutionary riots.
    At this point, the Hai Rui corpse from more than 300 years ago was revived by the souls of Deng Tuo and Wu Han. Moreover, one after another, a black line and two evil winds. One cursed the "emperor" in the newspaper, viciously attacking our Party Central Committee and viciously attacking our great leader Chairman Mao; the other exposed the "darkness" in front of Tiananmen, frantically attacking our socialist system and attacking the proletarian dictatorship.
    Look, this is the double act performed by Deng Tuo and Wu Han, colluding with each other and singing in unison in the summer of 1959.
    Today, the true face of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has been revealed, and the "Three-Family Village" black shop has been cracked down on. Shopkeeper Deng, you will not suffer from "amnesia." Do you still want to "deceive the heavens and cross the sea" or "escape like a cicada shedding its skin" for this sinful deal that you jointly operated before the black shop opened? Let me tell you the truth, it's impossible! Your own handwriting still exists, and your black hand has been caught by the people. The "contract" you jointly operated has also been seized by the people. We will never let you go. Weeding out poisonous weeds is good for fertilizing the fields. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate your anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. No matter what kind of shopkeeper, teacher, or clerk your black shop has, no matter what kind of monsters and demons, we will all pull them out and let the people of the whole country recognize your ugly faces in broad daylight and never be fooled by you again!

    《海瑞骂皇帝》的孪生兄弟
    邓拓在中国历史博物馆搞的反党反社会主义活动
    中国历史博物馆　王宏向
    吴晗在报纸上抛出了罪恶昭彰的《海瑞骂皇帝》，邓拓在历史博物馆中展出了《海瑞揭发了明代的黑暗统治》。通过一条黑线，吹起两股妖风
    邓拓反党反社会主义的原形被揭露以后，大大擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们恍然大悟，原来还有一个《海瑞骂皇帝》的孪生兄弟，必须马上彻底追查出来。这就是中国历史博物馆陈列中的《海瑞揭发了明代的黑暗统治》。
    一九五九年夏天，正当全国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，高举三面红旗，昂首阔步，向着资本主义和残余封建势力猛烈冲击，沿着社会主义大道奋勇前进的时候，反党反社会主义分子吴晗，怀着刻骨的仇恨，配合赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义和党内右倾机会主义分子，向我们伟大的领袖，伟大的党，发动了疯狂的进攻，抛出了罪恶昭彰的《海瑞骂皇帝》。恰恰在这个时候，天安门前历史博物馆的陈列中也出现了《海瑞揭发了明代的黑暗统治》。无独有偶，如出一辙。难道这真是偶然的巧合吗？不是，完全不是。经过我们调查，原来这是邓拓亲手磨制出来的，砍向我们党、砍向我们社会主义制度的一把屠刀。这是远在“三家村”黑店开张以前，邓拓、吴晗这伙黑帮串通一气，互相配合，向党向社会主义疯狂进攻的黑买卖。
    事情是这样：一九五八年十月至一九五九年十月，邓拓窃据了中国历史博物馆领导小组主要负责人的地位。本来，直到一九五九年五月中旬，经过六次修改的陈列大纲中，根本没有提到海瑞。突然，在吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》出笼以前不久，五月十二日，建馆领导小组的另一个成员指示：“海瑞应该表现一下”。于是，这个地主阶级的忠实奴才，屠杀人民的笑面虎海瑞，在历史陈列中袍笏登场了。最初的标题是《不畏强御，创立一条鞭法的海瑞》。另外，还拉出来一个陪客——《推行一条鞭法的张居正》。显然，这样的陈列手法是远远不合邓拓的心意的。第一、着重从一条鞭法讲海瑞，无法表达邓拓那不可告人的企图；第二、海瑞和张居正并列，海瑞无法突出；第三、硬把海瑞插在“明末农民起义”的背景中，如果没个适当的说法，的确风马牛不相及，容易露马脚。因此，邓拓亲手批示：
      “注意！
    在农民大起义的单元中，
    插进海瑞和张居正这一
    段，群众不容易了解其中
    的关系，在标题上可否考
    虑用适当方式表现这些主
    题之间的关系。”
    邓拓“批示”以后，张居正取消了，海瑞突出了，标题呢？《揭发黑暗，向皇帝作斗争的海瑞》。
    请看，这是不是《海瑞骂皇帝》的再版？！这样一来，自然“群众”“容易了解”了。了解什么？了解邓拓、吴晗异口同声，恶毒咒骂我们伟大的党，恶毒咒骂我们敬爱的领袖毛主席。其面目之狰狞，用心之毒辣，完全暴露无遗。
    可是，邓拓毕竟是个有“智谋”的“才子”，这样的标题，虽然可能发泄他们胸中对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨，但是，太露骨了，这伙黑帮的罪恶勾当，岂不很快要暴露吗？
    因此，在邓拓授意下，又改成了《从海瑞的谏诤中，看明代的黑暗统治》。隐蔽是隐蔽一些，但是太“冬烘”气。而且，邓拓的目的，也不是揭露明代的黑暗统治，于是，邓拓在用尽心机以后，亲自动手，改成：
    《海瑞揭发了明代的黑暗统治》！
    以后，邓拓又拿来了他收藏的海瑞“名片”，吴晗也兴致勃勃地送来他手中的一卷海瑞假画象，就这样，《海瑞骂皇帝》的孪生兄弟，竟堂堂皇皇地出现在天安门前中国历史博物馆的陈列之中。
    好一个《海瑞揭发了明代的黑暗统治》！这明明是反党反社会主义分子，在向我们党进攻，在咒骂我们的社会主义，咒骂我们的无产阶级专政，而且邓拓千方百计硬把它插在明末农民大起义之前。实际上，这是号召地、富、反、坏、右起来搞反革命暴乱。
    至此，三百多年前的海瑞僵尸，借邓拓、吴晗之魂复活了。而且一而二焉，一条黑线，两股妖风。一个在报纸上大骂“皇帝”，恶毒地攻击我们党中央，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席；一个在天安门前，大揭“黑暗”，疯狂地攻击我们社会主义制度，攻击无产阶级专政。
    请看，这就是邓拓、吴晗在一九五九年夏天，勾结一起，一唱一和，同台演出的双簧丑剧。
    时至今日，《海瑞罢官》的原形毕露了，“三家村”黑店破获了。邓掌柜，你是不会患“健忘症”的，黑店开张以前，你们合伙经营的这笔罪恶买卖，难道还想“瞒天过海”“金蝉脱壳”么？老实告诉你，办不到！你亲手的笔迹尚存，你的黑手已经被人民抓住了。你们合伙经营的“合同”也被人民查获了。我们一定不会放过你们的。锄了毒草好肥田。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决彻底搞掉你们的反党反社会主义的黑线。不论你们黑店的那个掌柜、先生、伙计，不论什么样的牛鬼蛇神，我们要统统拉出来，叫全国人民在光天化日之下，认清你们丑恶的嘴脸，永远不再上你们的当！
