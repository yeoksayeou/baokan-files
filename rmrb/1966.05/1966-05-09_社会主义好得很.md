    Socialism Is Extremely Good
    Wang Changpu, Deputy Instructor of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Third-Class Merit Recipient
    Deng Tuo cursed that our socialist construction was finished. He wants to spread rumors to confuse the public, but we will never fall for his tricks. "We will never forget Chairman Mao for our happiness, and we will never forget the Communist Party for our liberation." All working people across the country are singing in unison that socialism is good.
    Take this year's earthquake situation in Hebei as an example. My hometown is in an area of Hebei that was severely affected by the earthquake, and many houses collapsed. After the earthquake, the state and the people from all regions provided various forms of support in terms of ideology and materials: sending wood, sending mats, and airdropping cooked food by planes. In the severely affected areas, the People's Army went to help, and medical personnel went to the countryside; the local government took care of the elderly, the weak, the orphans, and the disabled, as well as the families of military martyrs, very thoughtfully. Despite the severity of the earthquake disaster, the commune members' morale remained very high.
    After the earthquake, everyone said: If it were not for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Commune, we don't know how many people would have been crushed to death, and we don't know how many families would have been broken apart. My grandfather said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can withstand any difficulty, no matter how great. If it were in the old society, there would be no way to survive." However, Deng Tuo shouted that our socialism was finished. The people of the whole country praise the goodness of socialism, but he gritted his teeth against socialism. He is serving imperialism and helping revisionism, trying to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration in China. We warn Deng Tuo: it won't work. We have the great Party, the great Chairman Mao, and the great People's Liberation Army. The Chinese people have enough strength to repel all attacks from enemies who oppose the Party and oppose socialism.

    社会主义好得很
    解放军某部副指导员、三等功臣　王长普
    邓拓咒骂我们的社会主义建设完蛋了。他想造谣惑众，我们决不上他的当。“幸福不忘毛主席，翻身不忘共产党”，全国劳动人民，都是齐唱社会主义好。
    就以今年河北地震情况来说吧。我的家乡是河北地震比较严重的地方，家乡的房屋倒塌比较多。地震发生以后，国家和各地人民给了思想上、物资上的各种支援：送木料，送席子，用飞机投熟食。地震严重的地区，人民的军队去帮助，医务人员下农村；村里的孤寡老幼和军工烈属，地方政府照顾的十分周到。地震灾害这样严重，社员情绪仍然很高。
    地震以后，大家都说：如果没有共产党、毛主席，没有人民公社，我们不知道有多少人被砸死，不知道有多少人要家破人亡。我爷爷说：“在共产党领导下，天大的困难都能抗住。如果在旧社会，那就没有法子活了。”可是，邓拓却叫喊我们的社会主义完蛋了。全国人民歌颂社会主义好，他对社会主义却咬牙切齿。他在给帝国主义效劳，帮修正主义的忙，想在中国搞反革命复辟。我们警告邓拓：办不到。我们有伟大的党，有伟大的毛主席，有伟大的解放军。中国人民有足够的力量，打退一切反党反社会主义的敌人的进攻。
