    *People's Liberation Army Daily* Editor's Note: In 1964, some companies excelled in military technology, but ideological problems also arose. Can this kind of "sprouting at both ends" be said to be half good and half bad, with gains and losses? Can it be said that there are both mistakes and achievements, and that it should be viewed with a one-divides-into-two approach? No!

    The saying that "sprouting at both ends" is half good and half bad is as fallacious as "politics must be implemented in professional work."

    Some people think: "Sprouting at both ends" may lose half a pound, but there are still eight ounces left; losing politics but gaining technology is still a good thing overall. This is actually putting technology first, not politics first; highlighting bourgeois politics, not proletarian politics.

    In fact, the so-called "sprouting at both ends" is only true on one end and false on the other. Studying Chairman Mao's works is squeezed out, political and ideological work is weakened, bourgeois ideology rises, and proletarian ideology declines. In a word, politics is impacted, and this is true. The so-called surge in military technology, which is not achieved on the basis of raising people's awareness, is a building on sand; it is false and unreliable.

    Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. If military affairs impact politics, even the lifeline is discarded, even the political soul is gone, then what use is it even if you have a little bit of technology!

    Chairman Mao teaches us that we must have a firm and correct political orientation. If we violate Mao Zedong Thought and the direction is wrong, the more the technology excels, the greater the harm. If the direction is wrong, how can we talk about half good and half bad, gains and losses! How can we talk about both mistakes and achievements! If we are talking about one divides into two, then it is only a matter of seriously learning a lesson and turning bad things into good things.

    We must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely criticize fallacies such as "politics must be implemented in professional work," "politics must be realized through professional work," and "there is no politics without professional work." Only by thoroughly eliminating the influence of these bourgeois ideas on our army can highlighting politics be truly implemented.

    In the Past Year, the Fifth Artillery Company's Technical Skills Surged Ahead, and Ideological Problems Also Surged Ahead.
    Is "Sprouting at Both Ends" Good and Bad?

    When the Fifth Artillery Company of a certain unit was implementing the spirit of the All-Army Political Work Conference and discussing how to highlight politics, they discussed this question: In 1964, because this company only focused on military technology and neglected political and ideological work, the phenomenon of "sprouting at both ends" appeared: military technology surged ahead, and ideological problems also surged ahead.

    During the discussion, everyone unanimously admitted that the surge in ideological problems was a bad thing for the company's development. However, some comrades couldn't understand why the surge in technology under these circumstances was also a bad thing. Some said: "Well, isn't it impossible for an army to have no technology? It's still an improvement if technology is improved, even if it's a little more. Is it a good thing for technology not to be strong?"

    How should we view this issue? Can "sprouting at both ends" be said to be half good and half bad? Everyone started a heated discussion.

    Most comrades believed that when studying technology, there is the question of what ideology is used to command it and whom it serves. Whether the surge in technology is a good thing or a bad thing, the primary consideration should be what ideology the technology is under the command of and whom it serves. Using bourgeois ideology as the commander, technology that is trained will inevitably lead to the further development of bourgeois ideology. The better this technology is, the greater the harm to the people. Only technology that is under the command of proletarian ideology can truly serve the proletariat. Therefore, technology cannot be viewed in isolation from politics. At that time, what ideology was used to control the Fifth Artillery Company's study of technology? Some comrades believed that, in summary, it was the word "championship." Because the company hadn't been rated as a Four-Good company for several years, they mobilized everyone to compete for first place and fight a turnaround to win honor for the unit. In order to compete for first place, daily study and Party and League activities were often squeezed out; anyone with ideological problems was asked to "hang up" their ideological baggage and deal with it after the competition, fearing that doing ideological work would affect the energy spent on grasping technology. Some comrades were enthusiastic about practicing technology, but it was purely to pursue honor. Some comrades gave an example: There was an old driver in the company who was one of the best in the whole regiment in terms of technology. However, once during a night march, when passing over a narrow and high bridge, he thought: The final assessment is coming soon. If something goes wrong while driving, the Five-Good title will be gone. As a result, he panicked, his hand weakened, and the direction of the car deviated, and one of the rear wheels of the artillery vehicle fell off the bridge. Like this, without correct ideological guidance, what use is it for technology to excel if it cannot be strong at the critical moment!

    Some comrades believed that without correct ideological guidance, the more technology excels, the worse things get. For example, during a live-fire shooting exercise at night, one squad had very high skills. In order to compete for first place and show off in front of the whole company, they let the driver run at full throttle and rush forward, wanting to enter the position early. As a result, they disrupted the driving order and got lost. When the "battle" was over, this squad hadn't found its position yet. If they ran to the wrong position during a real battle and delayed the battle opportunity, wouldn't that be a great disaster!

    Such emphasis on military affairs has an even greater impact on the company's ideological construction. At that time, in order to "fight for honor," they only focused on technology and didn't care about ideology, and the company saw "three kinds of air." Those whose technology excelled became arrogant, thinking that they had won first place, looking down on the comrades around them, and looking down on the fraternal companies. Those whose technology didn't excel became discouraged. If they failed to pass the shooting test, they felt dejected. You blamed me, and I blamed you. As a result, disunity and bad moods appeared in the company. One comrade also used his own experience to illustrate the bad consequences of highlighting military affairs and his ideological state. He said that once the leadership criticized him for not keeping up with the technology, he was determined to win honor for himself. From then on, he forgot to eat and sleep and practiced technology. Once, in a regimental competition, he won first place, and he became proud, thinking that he had some skills and that others were nothing. When others became deputy squad leaders, he complained that the leaders didn't promote him, became discouraged, and didn't work with peace of mind. Last year, he creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and repeatedly studied articles such as "Serve the People," clarifying for whom he was a soldier and for whom he was fighting, and his thinking underwent a great change. He said with deep feeling: "Technology can also excel in order to win personal honor, but the consequences are deadly. A revolutionary fighter should be everything for the Party and for the proletarian revolutionary cause."

    Many vivid facts have raised everyone's understanding, and the discussion has become more and more heated, and the thinking has become more and more elevated. Some said: "If we don't highlight politics and only focus on technology, if things develop like that, the company will go down an evil road. How can we be strong in battle!" Some said: "The purpose of our army is to serve the people wholeheartedly. We must never forget this purpose." Some said: "What is the essence of our company's surge in technology in 1964? It is highlighting military affairs and impacting politics. Highlighting politics is the core of Chairman Mao's army-building line, and we must never deviate from this fundamental line. If we don't highlight politics and only technology excels, we can say with certainty that it is a bad thing at any time and any place." Some said: "With this experience and lesson, we have raised our understanding and strengthened our determination to highlight politics, and bad things can be turned into good things."

### 前年，炮五连技术冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖  “两头冒尖”是一好一坏吗？

专栏：

    《解放军报》编者按：一九六四年，有的连队军事技术冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖。这种“两头冒尖”，能够说是一好一坏，有得有失吗？能够说既有错误，也有成绩，要一分为二吗？不能！
    “两头冒尖”是一好一坏的说法，同“政治要落实到业务上”一样，都是谬论。
    有人认为：“两头冒尖”，丢了半斤，还有八两，失掉了政治，得到了技术，总还是好事。这实际上是技术第一，而不是政治第一，是突出资产阶级政治，而不是突出无产阶级政治。
    其实，所谓“两头冒尖”，一头是真，一头是假。学习毛主席著作挤掉了，政治思想工作削弱了，资产阶级思想上升了，无产阶级思想下降了，一句话，冲击了政治，这是真的。所谓军事技术冒了尖，不是在提高人的觉悟的基础上搞起来的，是建筑在沙滩上的楼房，那是虚假的、靠不住的东西。
    毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。军事冲击了政治，连生命线都不要了，连政治灵魂都没有了，就算你有一点点技术，那又有什么用呢！
    毛主席教导我们，要有坚定正确的政治方向。如果违背了毛泽东思想，方向搞错了，技术越冒尖，危害就越大。方向搞错了，还谈得到什么一好一坏，有得有失呢！还谈得到什么既有错误，又有成绩呢！要是说一分为二的话，那只是认真接受教训，把坏事变为好事的问题。
    我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决批判“政治要落实到业务上”、“政治要通过业务来实现”、“没有无业务的政治”等等谬论。只有彻底清除这些资产阶级思想对我军的影响，突出政治才能真正落实。
    前年，炮五连技术冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖
    “两头冒尖”是一好一坏吗？
    某部炮五连在贯彻全军政治工作会议精神、讨论怎样突出政治时，曾经谈到这样一个问题：一九六四年，这个连由于只抓军事技术，忽视了政治思想工作，曾经出现“两头冒尖”的现象：军事技术冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖。
    在讨论中，大家一致承认，思想问题冒了尖，对连队建设是个坏事。但是，在这种情况下技术冒了尖也是个坏事，有些同志却想不通。有的说：“军队嘛，没有技术还行？技术搞多了些，总算有提高。难道技术不过硬，反倒是好事？”
    怎样看待这个问题呢？“两头冒尖”能说是一好一坏吗？大家展开了热烈的讨论。
    大部分同志认为：学技术，有个用什么思想来统帅和为谁服务的问题。技术冒尖是好事，还是坏事，首要的应看技术是受什么思想统帅的，是为谁服务的。用资产阶级思想作统帅，练出了技术，必然使资产阶级思想更加发展。这样的技术越好，对人民的危害就越大。用无产阶级思想统帅，练出的技术，才能真正地为无产阶级服务。因此不能离开政治孤立地看技术。当时，炮五连学技术是什么思想来支配的呢？一些同志认为：概括起来，是“锦标”二字。因为连队几年没有评上四好，就动员大家比赛争第一，打翻身仗，为本单位争口气。为了争第一，天天读、党团活动经常被挤掉；谁有思想问题，就要求谁把思想包袱“挂起来”，比赛以后再说，怕做思想工作影响了抓技术的精力。一些同志练技术劲头足，却是为了单纯追求荣誉。有的同志举了个例子：连里有个老司机，论技术，全团数一数二。可是一次夜间行军，通过一座又窄又高的小桥时，他想：现在快总评了，万一开车出了问题，五好就吹了。结果心一慌，手一软，车的方向偏了，炮车的一个后轮掉在桥外边。象这样，没有正确思想作指导，技术再冒尖，关键时刻不能过硬，又有什么用！
    一些同志认为：没有正确的思想作指导，技术越冒尖，越坏事。例如，一次夜间实弹射击，有个班技术很高，为了争第一，在全连面前露一手，就让司机开足马力，猛往前跑，想早进入阵地，结果打乱了行车秩序，跑迷了路，“战斗”结束了，这个班还没找到阵地。要是打仗时跑错阵地，耽误战机，岂不是大坏事吗！
    这样突出军事，对连队的思想建设影响更大。当时，为了“争气”，只抓技术不管思想，连队出现了“三气”。技术越冒尖的，越有骄气，认为自己得了第一，看不起周围同志，看不起兄弟连队。技术没有冒尖的，就泄气，打靶一不及格，就灰溜溜的，你怨我，我怨你。这样一来，连队里出现了不团结、闹情绪等邪气。有个同志还以自己的体会，说明了突出军事的恶果和他的思想状况。他说，有一次领导上批评他技术跟不上，他就下决心要为自己争口气，从此就废寝忘食地练技术。一次全团比赛，他得了第一，便骄傲起来，认为自己有两下子，别人都不在话下。别人当了副班长，他就埋怨领导不提拔自己，灰心丧气，工作不安心。去年，他活学活用毛主席著作，反复学习了《为人民服务》等文章，明确了为谁当兵、为谁打仗，思想有了很大转变。他深有感触地说：“为争个人荣誉，技术也能冒尖，但后果害死人。一个革命战士，应该是一切为了党，为了无产阶级革命事业。”
    不少生动的事实，使大家提高了认识，讨论越来越热烈，思想越来越提高。有的说：“不突出政治，光是技术冒尖，发展下去，连队会走到邪路上去，打仗怎么能过硬！”有的说：“我们军队的宗旨是全心全意为人民服务。任何时候都不能忘记这个宗旨。”有的说：“我们连一九六四年技术冒了尖的实质是什么？就是突出军事，冲击了政治。突出政治是毛主席建军路线的核心，我们决不能离开这个根本路线。不突出政治，光技术冒了尖，肯定地说，在任何时候、任何地点，都是坏事。”有的说：“有了这次经验教训，提高了认识，坚定了突出政治的决心，坏事就可以变成好事。”
