    According to Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd—The General Staff Department and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a rally this afternoon to warmly celebrate the great victory of the army and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in shooting down more than 1,000 aircraft of U.S. imperialism.

    When Colonel Tran Van Phung, military attache of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, accompanied by Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, and others, entered the venue, more than 800 commanders and fighters of the army, navy, and air force attending the conference applauded warmly, congratulating the heroic North Vietnamese army and people for creating brilliant achievements in resisting U.S. air bandits with conventional weapons.

    Liu Zhijian spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that the great victory of the army and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in shooting down more than 1,000 U.S. aircraft was a severe blow to the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war policy. He praised that this event once again powerfully proved a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism: what determines the outcome of a war is the nature of the war and the support of the people, it is the people rather than weapons, and people's war is the most effective magic weapon for defeating imperialism and its lackeys.

    After condemning the Johnson administration for intensifying its counter-revolutionary dual tactics, Liu Zhijian said that modern revisionists, centered around the leadership group of the CPSU, are also continuing to push their traitorous line of capitulation and peace-seeking with U.S. imperialism under the banner of "joint action" and "aid to Vietnam against America," attempting to use the heroic Vietnamese people's anti-American struggle for national salvation to conduct political transactions with U.S. imperialism. He emphatically pointed out that facts have proven time and again that today, to oppose U.S. imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism, the accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

    Liu Zhijian said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will, together with the people of the whole country, vow to be the backing of the Vietnamese brothers. No matter what the situation, we will fully support the fraternal Vietnamese people in fighting resolutely to the end, until complete victory.

    In his speech, Colonel Tran Van Phung said that the victory of shooting down more than 1,000 U.S. aircraft in North Vietnam and eliminating tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the South is a great and glorious victory of people's war. He pointed out that the paper tiger essence of the United States has been fully exposed. Even heavier defeats are awaiting U.S. imperialism.

    Speaking of the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples, Colonel Tran Van Phung said that the Vietnamese people have received the greatest support from the fraternal Chinese people in their struggle for their own survival. He wished that the fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of Vietnam and China would be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    我总参谋部和总政治部举行集会
    庆祝越南军民击落美机千余架的伟大胜利
    据新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋部和总政治部今天下午集会，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国军民击落美帝国主义飞机一千架以上的伟大胜利。
    当越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆武官陈文彭上校由中国人民解放军副总参谋长张宗逊、总政治部副主任刘志坚等陪同走进会场的时候，参加大会的八百多名陆海空军指战员热烈鼓掌，祝贺英雄的越南北方军民用常规武器在反击美国空中强盗中创造了辉煌战绩。
    刘志坚在大会上首先讲话。他指出，越南民主共和国军民击落美机一千架以上的伟大胜利，是对美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策的惨重打击。他赞扬说，这件事，又一次有力地证明了马克思列宁主义的一条普遍真理：决定战争胜负的，是战争的性质和人心的向背，是人民而不是武器，人民战争是战胜帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。
    刘志坚在谴责约翰逊政府加紧玩弄反革命的两手罪恶政策以后说，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，也在打着“联合行动”、“援越反美”的旗号，继续推行他们的那套向美帝国主义屈膝求和的叛徒路线，妄图利用英雄的越南人民的抗美救国斗争来同美帝国主义进行政治交易。他着重指出，事实一次再次地证明，在今天，要反对美帝国主义，就不能不反对现代修正主义这个美帝国主义的帮凶。
   刘志坚说，中国人民解放军将和全国人民一道，誓做越南兄弟的后盾。不管在什么情况下，我们全力支援兄弟的越南人民坚决打到底，直到彻底胜利。
    陈文彭上校在讲话中说，越南北方击落一千多架美国飞机和南方消灭数万美军的胜利，是人民战争的巨大辉煌的胜利。他指出，美国纸老虎的本质已经暴露无遗。更为沉重的失败正等待着美帝国主义。
    陈文彭上校在谈到越中两国人民友谊时说，越南人民在为自己的生死存亡的斗争中，得到了兄弟的中国人民最巨大的支援。他祝越中两国人民和军队之间的战斗友谊日益巩固和发展。
