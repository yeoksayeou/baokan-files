    According to Xinhua News Agency, May 19th, the vast numbers of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who vigilantly guard the forefront of the motherland's border and coastal defenses day and night, held symposiums in recent days on warships, at airports, in forward positions, and at border outposts, angrily refuting and criticizing Deng Tuo's gang for their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes. They said: We are the pioneers of defending the motherland, and also the pioneers of the Socialist Cultural Revolution. As soldiers guarding the most forward outposts of the motherland's coastal and border defenses, we will never allow Deng Tuo's gang to shoot cold shots and release poisonous arrows behind our backs, waving the "red flag" to oppose the Party and socialism. Everyone expressed their determination to smash the "Three-Family Village" black den, resolutely sweep away the monsters and demons like Deng Tuo, and defend Mao Zedong Thought and socialism.

    Vow to Carry This Class Struggle Through to the End
    Shi Jieshun, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works from a certain unit on the Fujian front, said at the symposium: Deng Tuo and his gang, enemies who do not carry guns, have launched a frantic and malicious attack on our great Party and socialist system. We are people's soldiers who hold guns, and we must not only deal seriously with all enemies who carry guns, but also resolutely fight to the end with all enemies who do not carry guns; we must not only see the enemies in front of us, but also ferret out the hidden enemies. No matter whether the enemy comes with force, with words, openly, or secretly, we will knock them all down and thoroughly disarm them. We are people's soldiers, and we must be pioneers of the Cultural Revolution. Yang Hongquan, a "Five-Good" soldier, said: Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han, and other small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements continuously released a large number of poisonous arrows and launched a frantic attack on the Party. This fully shows that Deng Tuo and his ilk are wearing the same pair of pants as the class enemies at home and abroad, and are all of the same ilk. Chairman Mao taught us that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. The rampant attacks of imperialism, modern revisionism, and domestic and foreign reactionaries cannot move us a single hair, but precisely show that what we are doing is right, and our socialist revolution and socialist construction are very good.

    Wen Kaichu, a third-class meritorious soldier and "Five-Good" soldier from a certain unit guarding the southwestern border of the motherland and who participated in the Sino-Indian border self-defense counterattack, said: Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the million serfs in Tibet have been emancipated and have gained the right to be masters of their own affairs. Deng Tuo's gang attempted to carry out capitalist restoration in our country, that is, to attempt to make the Tibetan people return to the dark rule of the feudal serf owners and live a subhuman life. We warn Deng Tuo and his gang of bad guys: your wishful thinking will not work, not in a million ways. Our troops stationed in Tibet will forever be with the Tibetan people, resolutely carry this class struggle through to the end, and defend the people's socialist and great country.

    Whoever Attacks the Party or Slanders Chairman Mao, the People's Soldiers Will Fight Them to the End
    Liu Fuwen, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works from the Langyashan Five Heroes Company of the Guangzhou Military Region, said: The anti-Party and anti-socialist element Deng Tuo viciously attacked the Party and slandered Chairman Mao, wanting people to "be their own masters and not be slaves," with the intention of making us not listen to the Party's words and not listen to Chairman Mao's words, that is, to let Deng Tuo's gang come to power and realize capitalist restoration in China. This will never happen! Liu Fuwen also said that in the old society, my family couldn't even afford a pair of wooden clogs. My father carried sedan chairs for landlords and capitalists for seventeen years, and my older brother and mother worked for the landlords. The whole family worked like cattle and horses, but we still didn't have enough to eat or wear. My eldest sister was forced to be sold to the landlord as a maid, and my second sister starved to death. I will never forget this subhuman life of slavery. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to completely liberate ourselves. The Party and Chairman Mao are even closer to me than my own relatives. Deng Tuo and his ilk wantonly want our Party to step down and want to drag us onto the capitalist road. This is a daydream! Whoever attacks the Party or slanders Chairman Mao, the people's soldiers will fight them to the end until they are completely defeated.

    Feng Fusheng, a pacesetter in studying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army and the political instructor of a certain air force unit on the Fujian front, said: Chairman Mao is our great revolutionary leader, and Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of our country have created the greatest and most glorious achievements in human history. In just over a dozen years, our country has developed from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial old society into a strong fortress of socialism. The vicious attacks and slanders of Deng Tuo and his ilk show that this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements harbor deep hatred for the Party, hate the leap forward development of socialist revolution and socialist construction with gnashing teeth, and tremble with fear at the great Mao Zedong Thought. The wheels of history can never be blocked by a small handful of reactionaries. On the contrary, everyone who is hostile to the Party and to socialism will eventually be crushed by the wheels of history. The fate of Deng Tuo and his gang will be no exception.

    Deng Tuo Attacks the Dictatorship of the Proletariat, Slanders the Great Leap Forward, and Is a Jackal of the Same Lair as Landlords, Rich Peasants, Counter-Revolutionaries, Bad Elements, and Rightists
    Hao Zhongyun, a combat hero and deputy division commander of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, said: The "Three-Family Village" black den keeper Deng Tuo, in his article "The Way of Benevolence and the Way of Hegemony," attacked our dictatorship of the proletariat by insinuation as "the way of hegemony," and as "relying on power." I want to shout loudly: Deng Tuo, you are not allowed to slander our great Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the old society, imperialism and bureaucratic capitalists, landlords and capitalists ran rampant everywhere, riding on the heads of the people and shitting and pissing. We poor people didn't even have the freedom to speak. Now, we working people, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have grasped the seal of power and are exercising dictatorship over the reactionary classes who oppressed and exploited the people in the past. We only allow them to be well-behaved and don't allow them to talk nonsense or act recklessly. This is completely repaying them in their own coin. In the eyes of us revolutionaries, being kind to the enemy is a crime against the people. We must not implement "the way of benevolence" and "benevolent government" towards you gang of black thugs. We must rely on the power of the people and the momentum of the people, and resolutely implement dictatorship over you.

    Yang Zucheng, a squad leader of a certain unit of the Hainan Island garrison guarding the southern gate of the motherland, said: In the past, we relied on the power of the people, the power of the revolution, and won the victory of the people's revolutionary war. Today, in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we still have to rely on the power of the people to win new victories in the three great revolutionary movements. Deng Tuo and his ilk gnash their teeth and attack our dictatorship of the proletariat as "hegemony." This can only completely expose that they are singing the same tune as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and standing on the same springboard. Almost at the same time as Deng Tuo "broke out of the door," a rich peasant in my hometown also cursed our Party as "hegemony" and cursed our cadres as "monopolizing power." Isn't Deng Tuo's black talk exactly the same as this rich peasant's black talk! Tell you, Deng Tuo, the proletariat wants to exercise dictatorship over the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and wants to exercise dictatorship over you gang of black thugs.

    Hu Yueshu, a "Five-Good" soldier who won meritorious service in the Sino-Indian border self-defense counterattack, said: We patrol the border line day and night, not allowing the enemy to trample on an inch of the motherland's territory. But Deng Tuo and his gang are waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, viciously attacking our Party and attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat as "hegemony," vainly trying to undermine us from within and change the color of our motherland. We have competed with the imperialist reactionaries, and also with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the reactionary serf owners in Tibet. We deeply understand that we must not talk about "the way of benevolence" or "benevolent government" to any class enemy. Deng Tuo and his ilk vainly try to dig the foundation of our socialism, and this is absolutely impossible. We must fight them to the end, just like we deal with enemies who carry guns.

    Sun Xiaoqing, a first-class meritorious serviceman of a certain air force unit, said: Deng Tuo's gang slandered the Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big," and "suffering a bloody nose" in the face of facts. He is completely opening his eyes and talking nonsense. Since the Great Leap Forward, I have to fly from the south of the motherland to the northeast almost every year. Overlooking the land of the motherland from the air, reservoirs, factories, and railways are increasing year by year, and the thriving scene is becoming more and more significant year by year. Especially when I drive a jet plane produced by the motherland and use gasoline produced by Daqing, I cheer from the bottom of my heart for the long live the general line, long live the Great Leap Forward, and long live the people's commune. My whole body is filled with the infinite power to eliminate the enemy. Deng Tuo and his ilk slander the Great Leap Forward, which can only show that they are thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

    Zhou Yuxiang, a soldier of a certain unit on the Fujian front, said: The general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune are the three red flags guiding us to the victorious construction of socialism. My hometown, Sanyuantang, is a hilly area. In the past, there would be droughts if it didn't rain for three days. Under the brilliant light of the general line, relying on the great power of the collective economy of the people's commune, a dam was built to divert the river water to the mountains, realizing self-flowing irrigation. Now there is a folk song circulating there: "In the past, in Sanyuantang, if it didn't rain for three days, there would be a shortage of food; today, in Sanyuantang, even if it doesn't rain for months, the rice is still full," The earth-shaking changes in my hometown are a powerful refutation of Deng Tuo's gang's slander of the Great Leap Forward.

    "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" Must Make a Thorough Explanation to the People
    Zhang Sheng, a "Five-Good" soldier and activist in studying Chairman Mao's works from a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region, said: For a long time, "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" have been doing anti-Party and anti-socialist activities under the guise of socialism. A series of poisonous arrows were shot at the people. Deng Tuo's gang's fox tails can't be hidden, you are playing tricks of false criticism and true sheltering, false struggle and true cover-up, releasing a lot of smoke, trying to protect the monsters and demons to pass the test, escape the giant palm of the people, so that they can regroup and make a comeback. The eyes of the people are sharp, and "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" want to hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat to muddle through, this is absolutely impossible!

    Many commanders and fighters of the Kunming Military Region stationed in the southwestern border of the motherland angrily questioned "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" at the symposium, what position have you been standing on for a long time, and what class's mouthpiece have you been playing? Why did you become Deng Tuo and his ilk's tool to attack the Party and socialism? And who supported and instructed you to do this? If you don't make a thorough explanation to the people, we will never agree!

    解放军边防海防战士严斥邓拓黑帮反党罪行
    坚决做社会主义文化大革命的尖兵  坚决和一切不拿枪的敌人斗争到底
    据新华社十九日讯　日日夜夜警惕守卫在祖国边防、海防前线的人民解放军广大干部战士，在舰艇上，机场上，在前沿阵地和边防哨卡，连日举行座谈，愤怒驳斥和批判邓拓黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行。他们说：我们是保卫祖国的尖兵，也是社会主义文化大革命的尖兵。我们守卫在保卫祖国最前哨的海防边防的战士，决不允许邓拓黑帮在我们背后打冷枪、放毒箭，打着“红旗”反党反社会主义。大家表示，一定要捣毁“三家村”黑店，坚决把邓拓之流的牛鬼蛇神彻底扫除，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫社会主义。
    誓把这场阶级斗争进行到底
    福建前线某部学习毛主席著作积极分子石杰顺在座谈会上说：邓拓这一伙不拿枪的敌人，向我们伟大的党和社会主义制度发起了疯狂的恶毒的攻击。我们是手握枪杆的人民战士，不但要认真对付一切拿枪的敌人，也要坚决和一切不拿枪的敌人斗到底；不但要看到眼前的敌人，还要揪出暗藏的敌人。不管敌人是武的来，文的来，明的来，暗的来，我们统统要把它们打倒，彻底缴它们的械。我们是人民战士，一定要做文化大革命的先锋。五好战士杨宏泉说：邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗等一小撮反党反社会主义分子，连续发出大量的毒箭，疯狂向党进攻。这充分说明邓拓之流与国内外阶级敌人是穿一条裤子的，是一路货。毛主席教导我们，被敌人反对是好事，而不是坏事。帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内外反动派对我们的猖狂进攻，丝毫也不能动我们一根毫毛，恰恰说明我们办的对，我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设好得很。
    守卫祖国西南边疆、参加过中印边界自卫反击战的某部三等功臣、五好战士文开初说：在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，西藏百万农奴翻了身，获得了当家作主人的权利。邓拓黑帮企图在我国实行资本主义复辟，也就是企图让西藏人民重新回到封建农奴主的黑暗统治下过非人的生活。我们警告邓拓这一伙坏家伙：你们的妄想办不到，一万个办不到。我们驻藏部队战士永远和藏族人民一道，坚决把这场阶级斗争进行到底，保卫人民的社会主义的大好江山。
    谁要攻击党，污蔑毛主席，人民战士就同他拼到底
    广州部队狼牙山五壮士连学习毛主席著作积极分子刘付文说：反党反社会主义分子邓拓恶毒地攻击党，污蔑毛主席，要人们“自作主人，不当奴才”，用意就是要我们不听党的话，不听毛主席的话，也就是让邓拓这伙黑帮上台，在中国实现资本主义复辟。这永远办不到！刘付文还说，在旧社会，我家连双木屐都穿不起，父亲给地主、资本家抬了十七年轿子，哥哥和妈妈给地主帮工。全家人象牛马般地劳动，还是吃不饱、穿不暖，大姐被迫卖给地主当丫头，二姐活活地饿死了。我永远忘不了这种牛马不如的奴隶生活。共产党毛主席领导我们彻底翻了身，党和毛主席比我亲人还要亲。邓拓之流猖狂地要我们党下台，想把我们拉向资本主义道路。这是白日作梦！谁要攻击党、污蔑毛主席，人民战士就和他们拼到底，直到把他们彻底斗垮。
    全军学习毛主席著作标兵、福建前线空军某部指导员丰福生说：毛主席是我们伟大的革命领袖，毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰。在毛泽东思想的指引下，我国人民创造了人类历史上最伟大最光辉的业绩，在短短十几年内，我们的国家从一个半封建半殖民地的旧社会发展成为社会主义的坚强堡垒。邓拓之流的恶毒攻击和污蔑，说明这一小撮反党反社会主义分子对党怀着刻骨的仇恨，对社会主义革命和社会主义建设的飞跃发展切齿痛恨，对伟大的毛泽东思想，害怕得发抖。历史的车轮决不是一小撮反动分子所能阻挡的，相反，一切与党、与社会主义为敌的人，最终一定要被历史的车轮碾得粉碎。邓拓一伙的下场，也决不会例外。
    邓拓攻击无产阶级专政，污蔑大跃进，和地富反坏右是一丘之貉
    战斗英雄、广州部队某部副师长郝忠云说：“三家村”黑店掌柜邓拓在《王道和霸道》一文中，指桑骂槐地攻击我们的无产阶级专政是“霸道”，是“依靠权势”。我要大喝一声：邓拓，不许你污蔑我们伟大的党和无产阶级专政。在旧社会，帝国主义和官僚、地主、资本家到处横行霸道，骑在人民头上拉屎拉尿，我们穷人连说话的自由都没有。现在，我们劳动人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，掌握了印把子，对过去压迫人民剥削人民的反动阶级实行专政，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动，这完全是以其人之道还治其人之身。在我们革命者看来，对敌人仁慈，就是对人民犯罪。我们对你们这伙黑帮，决不能实行“王道”和“仁政”。我们要依靠人民的权、人民的势，坚决对你们实行专政。
    守卫祖国南大门的海南岛驻军某部班长杨祖诚说：过去，我们依靠人民的权势，依靠革命的权势，取得了人民革命战争的胜利。今天，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，我们还是要依靠人民的权势，赢得三大革命运动的新的胜利。邓拓之流咬牙切齿地攻击我们的无产阶级专政是“霸道”，这只能彻底暴露他们和地富反坏右唱着一个调，站在一条跳板上。几乎和邓拓“破门而出”的同时，我的家乡有个富农，也大骂我们党“霸道”，骂我们干部“一手包揽大权”。邓拓的黑话和这个富农的黑话不是一模一样吗！告诉你们，邓拓，无产阶级就是要专地富反坏右的政，就是要专你们这伙黑帮的政。
    在中印边界自卫反击战中荣立战功的五好战士胡月书说：我们日夜巡逻在边境线上，不让敌人践踏祖国的一寸领土。而邓拓这一伙黑帮，却打着“红旗”反红旗，恶毒地攻击我们党，攻击无产阶级专政是“霸道”，妄想从内部来搞垮我们，使我们的祖国改变颜色。我们同帝国主义反动派较量过，同蒋介石匪帮和西藏反动农奴主也较量过，我们深深地懂得，对任何阶级敌人决不能讲什么“王道”“仁政”。邓拓之流妄想挖我们社会主义的墙脚，这是绝对办不到的。我们一定要象对付拿枪的敌人那样，同他们斗争到底。
    空军某部一等功臣孙孝庆说：邓拓黑帮污蔑大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”，他完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。自大跃进以来，我几乎每年都要从祖国的南方飞到东北，从空中俯视祖国大地，水库、工厂、铁路一年比一年多，欣欣向荣的景象一年比一年显著。特别是每当我驾驶着祖国生产的喷气式飞机，使用大庆生产的汽油时，打心眼里欢呼总路线万岁，大跃进万岁，人民公社万岁，全身都充满了消灭敌人的无穷力量。邓拓之流污蔑大跃进，这只能说明他们是彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义分子。
    福建前线部队某部战士周裕向说：总路线，大跃进，人民公社，是引导我们胜利建设社会主义的三面红旗。我的家乡三元塘是丘陵地区，过去，三天不下雨就要闹旱灾。在总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠人民公社集体经济的巨大威力，建成了拦河大坝，把河水引上山，实现了灌溉自流化。现在那里流传着一首民谣：“过去三元塘，三日不下雨，就要断草粮；今日三元塘，数月不下雨，稻谷仍满仓”，家乡翻天覆地的变化，就是对邓拓黑帮污蔑大跃进的有力驳斥。
              《前线》《北京日报》必须彻底向人民交代
    广州部队某部五好战士、学习毛主席著作积极分子张胜说：长期以来，《前线》《北京日报》打着社会主义的招牌，干的是反党反社会主义的勾当。向人民射出了一连串毒箭。邓拓之流的狐狸尾巴藏不住了，你们又玩弄假批判、真包庇，假斗争、真掩护的花招，大放烟幕，企图保护牛鬼蛇神过关，逃避人民的巨掌，以便他们重整旗鼓，卷土重来。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，《前线》《北京日报》想挂羊头卖狗肉蒙混过关，这绝对办不到！
    驻守在祖国西南边疆的昆明部队许多指战员，在座谈会上愤怒责问《前线》《北京日报》，长期以来，你们站在什么立场上，充当了什么阶级的喉舌？为什么充当邓拓之流向党向社会主义进攻的工具？又是谁支持、指使你们这样做的？你们如果不彻底向人民交代，我们决不答应！
