    Not to be an aggressive tool of the Johnson government, not to sell out for American monopoly capital.
    The American people rise up resolutely to oppose conscription and oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Johnson encounters strong protests from demonstrators in Chicago while campaigning for the Democratic Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Chicago News: About two hundred and fifty Chicago citizens held a demonstration on the evening of the 17th, expressing their strong protest against the American war of aggression against Vietnam directly to American President Johnson, who came to the city to campaign for the Democratic Party.
    The demonstrators waited in front of a large hotel in the city center, holding signs that read: "Withdraw American troops immediately!" and other slogans. Some demonstrators also carried a large banner with a fierce depiction of Johnson holding a gun and killing people, labeled with the words "Bloodthirsty"; next to it was written the slogan "Smash Johnson Imperialism!" When Johnson appeared to attend a dinner at the hotel, the demonstrators immediately issued a strong chorus of boos and slogans.
    Johnson delivered a speech at the dinner, reiterating the stubborn position of the United States to continue the war of aggression against Vietnam. He clamored that the U.S. government was "determined to resist aggression" and that "we will not back down"!
    Chicago municipal authorities deployed 1,500 armed police and a large number of plainclothes special agents for Johnson's safety.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Students at the University of Wisconsin in Madison continued to demonstrate in various ways on the 17th to protest the Johnson administration's war of aggression in Vietnam and oppose the school authorities' cooperation with the draft board in recruiting cannon fodder on campus.
    On this day, when four officials from the US State Department came to the school to give speeches and defend the US government's policy of aggression against Vietnam, students repeatedly booed in protest and shouted: "You are lying!" "Cheaters!" Many people angrily left the venue.
    The student union, representing 28,000 students at the school, decided that evening to resolutely demand that school authorities stop assisting the draft board in recruiting cannon fodder.
    At the same time, more than 500 students held an all-night anti-draft sit-in demonstration in the school's office building for the second day in a row.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Chicago News: The anti-draft demonstration by students at the University of Chicago entered its sixth day on the 16th.
    Students continued to hold a sit-in demonstration in the school's office building to protest the government authorities' manipulation of the so-called "intelligence test" as a new trick to send a large number of students to South Vietnam as cannon fodder.
    About two hundred students at the University of Wisconsin in Madison also held an all-night sit-in demonstration in the school's office building on the evening of the 16th, protesting the school authorities' cooperation with the draft board in recruiting cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Vietnam. Students at this school held an anti-draft demonstration on the 14th. (Attached picture)

    美国人民奋起坚决反对征兵反对侵越战争
    约翰逊到芝加哥为民主党竞选遭到示威群众强烈抗议
    新华社十八日讯　芝加哥消息：大约两百五十名芝加哥市民十七日晚上举行示威，向来到这个城市替民主党搞竞选活动的美国总统约翰逊当面表示他们对美国侵越战争的强烈抗议。
    示威群众守候在市中心一家大旅馆门前，他们举着的标语牌上写着：“立即把美国军队撤回来！”等口号。一些示威者还抬着一个大横幅，上面画着约翰逊举枪杀人的凶相，注上了“嗜血者”的字样；旁边还写上了“粉碎约翰逊帝国主义！”的口号。当前来这家旅馆出席晚宴的约翰逊一露面，示威群众立即发出了一片强烈的嘘声和口号声。
    约翰逊在这次宴会上发表了讲话，重申美国决心把侵略越南的战争继续打下去的顽固立场。他叫嚷，美国政府“有决心抵抗侵略”，“我们决不会退出来”！
    芝加哥市政当局为了约翰逊的安全，出动了一千五百名武装警察和大批便衣特务。
    新华社十八日讯　美国麦迪逊市威斯康星大学的学生十七日继续以各种方式进行示威，抗议约翰逊政府在越南进行侵略战争，反对学校当局配合征兵局在学校里进行搜罗炮灰的活动。
    这一天，当美国国务院的四名官员来学校发表演说，为美国政府侵略越南的政策辩解时，学生们在会场上不断发出嘘叫声表示抗议，并且高呼：你们在撒谎！”“骗子手！”许多人愤怒地退出了会场。
    代表这个学校二万八千名学生的学生会在当天晚上决定坚决要求学校当局停止协助征兵局进行搜罗炮灰的活动。
    在这同时，有五百多名学生接连第二天在学校的办公楼里举行通宵达旦的反征兵静坐示威。
    新华社十七日讯　芝加哥消息：芝加哥大学学生的反征兵示威，在十六日进入了第六天。
    学生们继续在学校的办公楼里举行静坐示威，抗议政府当局玩弄所谓“智力测验”的新花招，以便把大批学生送往南越充当炮灰。
    麦迪逊市威斯康星大学约二百名学生十六日晚上也在学校的办公楼里举行通宵达旦的静坐示威，抗议学校当局配合征兵局搜罗侵越炮灰。这个学校的学生曾经在十四日举行过反征兵的示威活动。（附图片）
