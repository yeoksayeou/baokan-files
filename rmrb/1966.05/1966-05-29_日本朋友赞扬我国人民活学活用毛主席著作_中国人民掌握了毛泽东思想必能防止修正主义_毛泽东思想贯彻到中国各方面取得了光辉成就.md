    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 28th. Saito Norie, head of the 12th Japan-China Friendship Association delegation to China, and some members of the delegation, spoke to Xinhua reporters here about their impressions of their month-long visit to China. They warmly praised the brilliant achievements of China's socialist construction and the Chinese people's unwavering belief in socialism and communism. They believe this is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    Saito Norie said: The most profound impression of visiting various parts of China is that Mao Zedong Thought has been implemented in all aspects of China.
    Saito, who has visited China four times, said that China has made great progress and changes in all aspects compared to her previous three visits. What is valuable is that this development has been achieved by the Chinese people in the struggle against three consecutive years of natural disasters and in the struggle against the difficulties created by Soviet revisionism. She said that the source of the Chinese people's strength is that Mao Zedong Thought has armed the people's minds, the people highly trust the government, and they all understand that they must work for the revolution.
    Saito praised China for actively cultivating and educating the younger generation with Mao Zedong Thought, so that they can become true revolutionary successors. She said, "What surprised me is that even kindergarten children say, 'I listen to Chairman Mao, I am not naughty.'"
    When delegation member Sakai Mouichiro talked about the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people, he said that in China, Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated deeply into people's hearts and has become a material force with flesh and blood. Wherever he went, whether he contacted workers, farmers, students, train attendants, or residents, they thought of today's happiness, did not forget the past suffering, had deep feelings for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and had unwavering faith in socialism and communism. The younger generation has the entire Chinese people and the people of the world in their hearts, and does not pursue personal enjoyment. He said that the Chinese people are full of optimism and confidence in the future. The longer you stay in China, the deeper this impression becomes.
    Sakai highly praised the Chinese people's attitude of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He said: China combines learning with work and practice. When difficulties arise, they consult Chairman Mao's works. This is the most important point. He will also study Mao Zedong's works in this way in the future.
    Sakai expressed his firm belief that the Chinese people's study of Mao Zedong's works and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought is a guarantee against preventing revisionism.
    When talking about China's third nuclear test, delegation leader Saito emphasized that the success of China's nuclear test is a firm response to the United States' policy of nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail. Because China's manufacture of nuclear weapons is for the purpose of defending peace, it is a great contribution to world peace and an aid to the Japanese people's struggle against US imperialist aggression.
    Delegation member Fujiwara Kenji pointed out in an interview with reporters that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government are very successful in conducting thorough and heart-felt proletarian education that does not forget the past for the people, especially for the younger generation, who are the pillars of China's future. This will enable China to become an invincible country forever.
    The members of the delegation all talked about their desire to further enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. Delegation members Fujiwara and Sakai also condemned the recent war provocations by US imperialism against China. Fujiwara said: The people of Japan and China should join hands and resolutely overthrow US imperialism. All peace-loving people in the world should resolutely unite and eliminate US imperialism from the earth as soon as possible.
    The delegation was invited to visit China by the China-Japan Friendship Association. They are about to leave here and return to their country.

    日本朋友赞扬我国人民活学活用毛主席著作
    中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想必能防止修正主义  毛泽东思想贯彻到中国各方面取得了光辉成就
    新华社广州二十八日电　日中友协第十二次访华代表团团长斋藤纪江和部分团员在这里对本社记者畅谈他们一个月来的访华观感时，热情赞扬中国社会主义建设所取得的光辉成就，和中国人民对社会主义、共产主义的不可动摇的信念。他们认为，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    斋藤纪江说：在中国各地访问给人印象最深的是毛泽东思想已经贯彻到中国的各个方面。
    已经四次访问中国的斋藤说，中国比她前三次来访问时各方面都有了很大的发展和变化，可贵的是这种发展是中国人民在同连续三年的自然灾害的斗争中、在同苏联修正主义制造的困难的斗争中取得的。她说，中国人民这种力量的源泉是毛泽东思想武装了人们的头脑，人民高度地信赖政府，都懂得要为了革命而工作。
    斋藤赞扬中国正在积极地用毛泽东思想培养和教育青年一代，使他们成为真正的革命接班人。她说，使我惊奇的是，连幼儿园的孩子都说“我听毛主席的话，我不淘气。”
    代表团团员坂井孟一郎在谈到中国人民的精神面貌时说，在中国，毛泽东思想深入人心，已经变成有血有肉的物质力量。每到一处，接触到的无论是工人、农民、学生、列车员还是居民，想到今天的幸福，不忘过去的苦难，对中国共产党和毛主席怀着深厚的感情，对社会主义和共产主义怀着不可动摇的信念。年青的一代心里都装着全中国人民和全世界人民，而不追求个人的享乐。他说，中国人民对未来充满着乐观和信心。在中国多耽一天，这种印象便加深一分。
    坂井十分赞扬中国人民活学活用毛主席著作的学习态度。他说：中国结合工作和实际进行学习，当发生困难时，就去向毛主席著作请教，这是最重要的一点。他今后也要这样来学习毛泽东的著作。
    坂井表示坚信，中国人民大学毛泽东著作，掌握毛泽东思想，对防止修正主义是有保证的。
    在谈到中国的第三次核试验的时候，代表团团长斋藤强调说，中国核试验的成功是对美国的核垄断核讹诈政策的坚决回答。因为中国制造核武器是为了保卫和平的目的，对世界和平是一个很大的贡献，也是对日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略斗争的援助。
    代表团团员藤原宪治在向记者谈话时指出，中国共产党和中国政府对人民，特别是对中国未来的栋梁——青年一代进行深入人心的、不忘过去的无产阶级教育是很成功的。这样就能使中国成为一个永远不可战胜的国家。
    代表团的成员们都谈到了进一步增进中日两国人民友谊的愿望。代表团团员藤原和坂井还谴责美帝国主义最近对中国的战争挑衅行为，藤原说：日中两国人民应该携起手来，坚决打倒美帝国主义。全世界爱好和平的人民，应该坚决地团结起来，早日从地球上消灭美帝国主义。
    代表团是应中日友协邀请来我国访问的。他们即将离开这里回国。
