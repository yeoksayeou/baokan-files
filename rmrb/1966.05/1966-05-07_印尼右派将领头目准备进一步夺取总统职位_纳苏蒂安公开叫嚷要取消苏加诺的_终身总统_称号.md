    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th: Nasution, one of the ringleaders of the Indonesian right-wing general clique, recently publicly clamored for the abolition of Sukarno's title of "President for Life" in order to completely abandon Sukarno and thus pave the way for the right-wing general heads to seize the presidential position.
    Nasution has long plotted to overthrow President Sukarno and replace him. Since the right-wing general clique seized state power from President Sukarno and established a military dictatorship, he first pretended to clamor for the thorough implementation of the 1945 Constitution and the election of a vice president. Now, he is openly clamoring that the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly's granting of the title of "President for Life" to Sukarno is "a violation of the 1945 Constitution." According to *Angkatan Bersendjata* (Armed Forces Daily) , Nasution gave a speech in Jakarta on April 29 to members of some reactionary organizations and reactionary students, clamoring that the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly's granting of the titles of "President for Life" and "Great Leader of the Revolution" to Sukarno was a violation of the constitution. He said, "Now, there are clearly many things, big and small, that violate the 1945 Constitution." Among the "major constitutional violations" were the decisions regarding the positions of "President for Life" and "Great Leader of the Revolution." These two titles "must be reconsidered." He said, "President for Life clearly violates the provisions of the 1945 Constitution, because the 1945 Constitution clearly stipulates that the President's term of office is only five years, and five years is not for life." He attacked the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly for "undermining the progress of the revolution." Nasution also said: "The Indonesian Armed Forces are so determined to raise the constitutional issue and defend the constitution because the army's policies and principles are the constitution."
    President Sukarno was granted the titles of "Great Leader of the Revolution" and "President for Life" by the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly in November 1960 and May 1963, respectively.
    On the same day that Nasution spoke, more than two thousand right-wing students in Jakarta took to the streets, shouting slogans against Sukarno's holding the title of "President for Life," and expressing their support for the right-wing general clique. These reactionary students also threatened that if the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly did not abolish the title of "President for Life," the members of the meeting "had better resign."

    印尼右派将领头目准备进一步夺取总统职位
    纳苏蒂安公开叫嚷要取消苏加诺的“终身总统”称号
    据新华社六日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团头目之一纳苏蒂安最近公开叫嚷取消苏加诺“终身总统”的称号，以便彻底抛弃苏加诺，从而为右派将领头目夺取总统的职位铺平道路。
    纳苏蒂安长期以来一直阴谋推翻苏加诺总统并取而代之。他在右派将领集团从苏加诺总统手中夺取国家权力建立军事独裁政权以来，先是故作姿态地叫嚷要彻底执行一九四五年宪法和选举副总统，现在又进而公开叫嚷临时人民协商会议授予苏加诺以“终身总统”的称号是“违反一九四五年宪法的”。据《武装部队报》报道，纳苏蒂安四月二十九日在雅加达对一些反动组织成员和反动学生发表讲话，叫嚷临时人民协商会议授予苏加诺以“终身总统”和“革命伟大领袖”的称号是违反宪法的。他说，“现在，明明有大大小小的许多违反一九四五年宪法的事”。在“大的违宪事件中”就有关于“终身总统”和“革命伟大领袖”职位的决定。对这两个头衔“必须重新加以考虑”。他说，“终身总统分明违反一九四五年宪法的规定，因为一九四五年宪法明文规定总统的任期只有五年，五年就不是终身。”他攻击临时人民协商会议“破坏了革命的进程”。纳苏蒂安还说：“印度尼西亚共和国武装部队这么坚决地提出宪法问题，并捍卫宪法，是因为军队的政策和原则就是宪法。”
    苏加诺总统是先后在一九六○年十一月和一九六三年五月由临时人民协商会议授予“伟大革命领袖”和“终身总统”的称号的。
    就在纳苏蒂安讲话的当天，雅加达市两千多名右派学生走向街头，狂呼反对苏加诺担任“终身总统”的口号，表示支持右派将领集团。这批反动学生还威胁说，如果临时人民协商会议不取消“终身总统”的称号，会议成员“最好辞职”。
