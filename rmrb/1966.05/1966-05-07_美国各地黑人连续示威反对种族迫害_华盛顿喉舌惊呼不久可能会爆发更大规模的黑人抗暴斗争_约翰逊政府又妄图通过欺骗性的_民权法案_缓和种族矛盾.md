    (Report from our newspaper) The explosive situation of the Black people's struggle in the United States this spring and the development of the American people's movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam have made the American ruling clique uneasy. Recent events have caused even greater alarm.
    The April 25th issue of *U.S. News & World Report* reflected this panic, saying: "The violence that erupted in mid-April and the warnings from Black spokesmen have reinforced the fear that the United States may see larger and more bloody anarchist actions." The magazine listed three consecutive incidents:
    On April 11th, in a park near Washington, D.C., several thousand Black youths rioted because park authorities closed early to restrict their activities. The incident quickly escalated. Ignoring police intervention, they surged to within half a mile of the White House. The magazine said they "left a trail of terror in Washington, the 'showcase city' of the United States," making people afraid that the capital would have even more serious trouble.
    On April 12th, in Berkeley, California, two thousand anti-Vietnam War protesters fought with police. At a rally, protesters "hanged" a effigy representing Johnson.
    On April 14th, a "Poor People's Conference" was held in Washington, D.C., with the majority of participants being Black. They drove away the head of Johnson's "anti-poverty" program who went to attend their conference. The magazine expressed particular unease about the anger of the Black people. It quoted a Black leader as saying that in many cities, the mood of Black people has reached the point of unrest, and warned that at least forty American cities may experience violence this summer.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Washington) As the struggle of Black people in the United States against racial oppression and for their own rights rises daily, and as the American ruling clique is uneasy about the brewing new storm of Black struggle, U.S. President Johnson submitted a "civil rights" message to Congress on April 28, proposing that Congress pass a new 1966 "Civil Rights Act," attempting to use this trick to deceive the Black masses and ease the sharp racial contradictions within the country, that is, the class contradiction between the Black masses, who are at the bottom of American society, and the American big bourgeoisie ruling clique.
    However, Johnson had to admit that the pervasive racial discrimination in American society cannot be resolved by a single piece of legislation. He himself said that the U.S. Congress's decision in 1954 to eliminate racial discrimination in public schools has been more than a decade, and now it still "needs to give new strength to this decision." All U.S. legislation on "civil rights" has not provided a real guarantee against racial discrimination.
    In his message, Johnson also openly used the pretext of opposing racial discrimination to demand the strengthening of the U.S. ruling clique's state apparatus—the Federal Bureau of Investigation—used to persecute the people, especially to suppress the Black people. He demanded an increase in the agency's agents and funding.

    美国各地黑人连续示威反对种族迫害
    华盛顿喉舌惊呼不久可能会爆发更大规模的黑人抗暴斗争
    约翰逊政府又妄图通过欺骗性的“民权法案”缓和种族矛盾
    本报讯　今年入春以来，美国黑人斗争一触即发的形势和美国人民反对侵越战争运动的发展，使美国统治集团惴惴不安。最近接连发生的事件，更引起了它的惊慌。
    四月二十五日出版的《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志反映这种惊慌说：“四月中爆发的暴力事件和黑人发言人的警告，加强了这种恐惧，即美国可能爆发更大的和流血更多的无政府的行动”。杂志列举了接连发生的三次事件：
    四月十一日，在华盛顿附近的一座公园里，几千黑人青年因为公园当局为限制他们活动而提早关门而骚动。事件迅速扩大。他们不顾警察的干涉，一直冲到了离白宫只有半英里远的地方。这家杂志说，他们给华盛顿这个“美国的橱窗城市”“留下了恐怖的足迹，使人害怕首都将有更严重的麻烦”。
    四月十二日，在加利福尼亚州的伯克利市，二千名反对侵越战争的示威者同警察展开了搏斗。示威者在集会上把代表约翰逊的模拟人象拿出来处了“绞刑”。
    四月十四日，在华盛顿举行了“穷人大会”，参加者大部分是黑人，他们赶走了去参加他们大会的约翰逊政府“反贫穷”计划的负责人。这家杂志特别对黑人的怒火表示不安。它引一位黑人领袖的话说，在许多城市里，黑人的情绪达到了骚动的程度；并且警告说，今年夏天，至少有四十个美国城市可能爆发暴力事件。
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：在美国黑人反对种族压迫、争取自身权利的斗争日益高涨，美国统治集团对酝酿中的黑人斗争新风暴惴惴不安的时候，美国总统约翰逊四月二十八日向国会提出了一个“民权”咨文，建议国会通过新的一九六六年“民权法案”，妄图用这个花招来欺骗黑人群众，缓和国内尖锐的种族矛盾，也就是处于美国社会最底层的黑人群众同美国大资产阶级统治集团之间的阶级矛盾。
    但是，约翰逊不得不承认，在美国社会里无孔不入地盛行的种族歧视，不是一纸立法所能够解决得了的。他自己也说，美国国会一九五四年通过取消公立学校中的种族歧视的决定，迄今已十余年，现在仍然“需要给这个决定以新的力量”，美国所有关于“民权”的立法，都没有给反对种族歧视以真正的保障。
    约翰逊在咨文里还公然借口反对种族歧视，而要求加强美国统治集团用来迫害人民、特别是镇压黑人的国家机器——联邦调查局。他要求增加这个机构的特务和经费。
