    Treat Early, Treat Small, Treat Thoroughly
    After the Socialist Education Movement, the Wangjiageda Party Branch of the Lanshui Commune in Changzi County, Shanxi Province, strengthened its organizational life, rigorously conducted criticism and self-criticism, corrected shortcomings, prevented errors, and enhanced understanding and combat effectiveness. Their experience is: "Communist Party members must never forget criticism and self-criticism, and must treat problems arising among party members early, small, and thoroughly."
    Our exposure of errors and criticism of shortcomings, like a doctor treating an illness, is entirely for the purpose of saving people.
    Treat early means to discover and treat early. Treat your own and your comrades' errors and shortcomings like illnesses, treating them as early as possible, because early treatment makes it easier to cure. Treat small means don't think that shortcomings and errors are small and therefore ignore them or fail to treat them seriously. Eliminating small shortcomings and errors in their infancy can reduce or prevent losses to the revolutionary cause and enable those with shortcomings and errors to become healthy. Treat thoroughly means to treat completely. If it is not treated thoroughly, it will recur in the future.
    Doctors must love their patients in order to conscientiously and responsibly treat their illnesses early, small, and thoroughly. Patients must also cooperate with doctors and not avoid medical treatment because they are ashamed of their illness in order to treat the illness early, small, and thoroughly. Comrades who help others and comrades who are being helped should both do this.

    治早·治小·治了
    山西省长子县岚水公社王家疙瘩党支部在社会主义教育运动以后，健全组织生活，严格开展批评和自我批评，改正了缺点，防止了错误，提高了认识，增强了战斗力。他们的体会是：“共产党员决不能忘了批评和自我批评，必须把党员中产生的毛病治早、治小、治了。”
    我们揭发错误，批判缺点，目的和医生治病一样，完全是为了救人。
    治早，就是早发现，早治疗。对待自己和同志们的错误和缺点，要象对病一样，及早治疗，早治就容易治好。治小，就是不要以为缺点小、错误小，就不重视它，不认真治。把小缺点、小错误消灭在萌芽时期，可以使革命事业少受或不受损失，可以使有缺点错误的人健康起来。治了，就是要治得彻底。如果不治了，将来还会复发。
    医生热爱病人，才能认真负责地把病人的病治早、治小、治了。病人也同医生合作，不讳疾忌医，才能把病治早、治小、治了。帮助别人的同志和被帮助的同志都应该这样。
