    New Emerging Forces Weightlifting Invitational Tournament Ends Victoriously
    Eighteen Athletes Break Nineteen New Games Records Forty-Four Times; Our Athletes Break Two World Records Three Times
    (Xinhua News Agency, May 24) The 1966 New Emerging Forces Weightlifting Invitational Tournament concluded victoriously tonight amidst warm applause from the audience. This was a successful competition with both accomplishments and friendship in abundance. Over the five days of competition across eight weight classes, a total of eighteen athletes from four countries broke nineteen records (total scores for seven weight classes and twelve individual event scores) from the first New Emerging Forces Games a total of forty-four times, including two Chinese athletes who broke two world records three times and equaled one world record. Many other athletes broke national and regional weightlifting records or improved their personal bests.
    The weightlifting delegations and observers from the twelve countries and regions participating in the Invitational Tournament have already formed close friendships during the tournament. The sixty-two athletes participating in the competition and performances all strived for good results. They often encouraged each other, congratulated each other, and exchanged techniques and experiences together.
    In the final two weight classes held tonight—light heavyweight and heavyweight—four athletes from China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Syria successively broke five records from the first New Emerging Forces Games a total of sixteen times. Chinese athletes Yu Shoujin and Peng Guangzhu won the championships in these two weight classes respectively.
    Yu Shoujin, a twenty-four-year-old light heavyweight athlete, after a fierce competition with Korean athlete Kim Jung-il, achieved a total score of 455 kilograms (140 in the press, 135 in the snatch, and 180 in the clean and jerk), not only greatly exceeding the first New Emerging Forces Games record of 400 kilograms for this weight class, but also breaking his own national record of 442.5 kilograms.
    Kim Jung-il won the silver medal with a total score of 447.5 kilograms. His press, snatch, and clean and jerk scores were 145, 132.5, and 170 kilograms respectively, all breaking the first New Emerging Forces Games records.
    Syrian athlete Mu. Sa. Mudaralal won the bronze medal with a total score of 415 kilograms (130 in the press, 125 in the snatch, and 160 in the clean and jerk). His total score and the 135 kilograms achieved in the fourth successful press attempt both broke the first New Emerging Forces Games record and his national record. His clean and jerk score also broke the first New Emerging Forces Games record.
    The heavyweight competition, involving six athletes weighing over 90 kilograms, saw the following top three finishers:
    First place: Chinese athlete Peng Guangzhu, total score of 432.5 kilograms;
    Second place: Japanese athlete Masayuki Watanabe, total score of 380 kilograms;
    Third place: Syrian athlete Mu. A. Maaz, also with a total score of 380 kilograms.

His total score was 470 kilograms (155 in the press, 145 in the snatch, and 170 in the clean and jerk), not only greatly exceeding the first New Emerging Forces Games record of 430 kilograms for this weight class and his own national record of 455 kilograms, created in September last year, but also approaching the world record of 477.5 kilograms.
    Korean athlete Kim Yong-il won the silver medal in the light heavyweight competition with a total score of 412.5 kilograms. His 137.5 kilogram press score and the 140 kilograms he achieved in the fourth successful press attempt both broke the first New Emerging Forces Games record.
