    Deng Tuo became the head of the preparatory group for the construction of the Chinese History Museum on May 15, 1959. Since then, he has used the Chinese History Museum as another stronghold for attacking the Party. Comrade Wang Hongxiang, in his article "The Twin Brother of 'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor'" (People's Daily, May 14), exposed Deng Tuo's criminal activities of adding content about Hai Rui to the museum's exhibits, shooting his anti-Party poisonous arrows. Now, I plan to make some further exposures.

    When Deng Tuo served as the head of the preparatory group for the construction of the Chinese History Museum, he first directed the anti-Party and anti-socialist spearhead at Mao Zedong Thought. The responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee clearly instructed that the History Museum should display the history of the working people and the history of class struggle and production struggle. However, Deng Tuo emphasized, "Ideology is an abstract thing, and it is not easy to display." In his view, Mao Zedong Thought and the theory of class struggle were "abstract things," "empty talk," and not easy to display. He also said: "If the entire exhibition follows the history of social development and breaks the dynasty system, it cannot be integrated with Chinese history, so dynasties must still be retained." In this way, Deng Tuo turned the Chinese History Museum into a museum of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers.

    Deng Tuo also vigorously promoted class reconciliation and negated class struggle. He "instructed": "In the Tang Dynasty, don't talk about tyranny, don't talk about corruption." As a result, the general history exhibition could not profoundly reveal the tyranny, exploitation, and oppression of the feudal ruling class, and the irreconcilable class contradictions existing in feudal society. He spread this theory of class reconciliation, attempting to make the people give up class struggle and serve the "peaceful evolution" of capitalism.

    In addition, Deng Tuo also babbled nonsense, saying that "slave society should give people a sense of greatness" and "feudal society should be magnificent." This is not only beautifying the exploitation system and the exploiting class, but also has extremely vicious political intentions. He used the beautification of the old society to indirectly attack our socialist system today. The Party teaches us that the working people should learn history mainly to not forget the past exploitation and oppression, but Deng Tuo and his gang wanted us to miss the past. This was paving the way for the restoration of feudalism and capitalism.

    邓拓的黑线伸进历史博物馆
    刘如仲
    邓拓在一九五九年五月十五日到中国历史博物馆担任建馆筹备组组长。此后，他就把中国历史博物馆作为他攻击党的又一据点。王宏向同志在《〈海瑞骂皇帝〉的孪生兄弟》（《人民日报》五月十四日）一文中，曾经揭露了邓拓在馆内增加陈列海瑞的内容，射出他的反党毒箭的罪恶活动。现在，我拟再作一些揭露。
    邓拓在担任中国历史博物馆建馆筹备组组长时，首先把反党反社会主义的矛头指向毛泽东思想。党中央负责同志明确指示，历史博物馆要摆出劳动人民的历史，摆出阶级斗争、生产斗争的历史。可是，邓拓强调说：“思想是抽象的东西，不好摆。”在他看来，毛泽东思想、阶级斗争学说是“抽象的东西”，是“空话”，不好摆出来。他还说：“整个陈列如按社会发展史，打破王朝体系，和中国历史结合不起来，还是要保留朝代。”就这样，邓拓把中国历史博物馆变成了帝王将相的博物馆。
    邓拓还极力宣扬阶级调和，否定阶级斗争。他“指示”：“唐代不要讲暴政，不要讲腐朽”。结果使得通史的陈列不能深刻揭示封建统治阶级的暴政、剥削、压迫，和封建社会内存在着的不可调和的阶级矛盾。他散布这种阶级调和论，妄图让人民放弃阶级斗争，为资本主义“和平演变”服务。
    此外，邓拓还胡说什么“奴隶社会要给人以伟大的感觉”，“封建社会要富丽堂皇”。这不仅是美化剥削制度和剥削阶级，而且是有着极其恶毒的政治企图的。他借美化旧社会，绕个弯子攻击我们今天的社会主义制度。党教导我们劳动人民学历史，主要是为了不忘过去的剥削和压迫，而邓拓一伙却要我们留恋过去，这是在为封建主义、资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
