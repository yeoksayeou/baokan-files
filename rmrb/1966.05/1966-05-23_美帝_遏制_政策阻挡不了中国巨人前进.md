    U.S. Imperialism's "Containment" Policy Cannot Stop the Advance of the Chinese Giant
    A report released by the U.S. House of Representatives admits that the U.S.'s anti-China policy has been a complete failure, that the Chinese revolutionary regime is "very stable," and that the Chinese people have achieved "unparalleled accomplishments," and that the U.S. has no hope of promoting "peaceful evolution" in China. But it also clamors to organize an anti-China front and advocates continuing to pursue a policy of "peaceful evolution." This shows that although the U.S.'s anti-China policy has completely failed, it is not resigned to defeat and will continue to make trouble.
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 21st -- A report entitled "U.S. Policy Towards Asia" submitted by the Far East and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, had to admit that the U.S. government's stubbornly hostile policy towards the Chinese people, which it has pursued since the founding of New China seventeen years ago, has been a complete failure. The U.S.'s containment, embargo, blockade, etc., have not harmed a single hair on the Chinese people's heads. On the contrary, the Chinese people have "achieved unparalleled accomplishments."
    However, the report shows that the U.S. ruling clique will continue to spin around in the dead end of its hostile policy towards China and will not change its antagonistic stance towards the Chinese people at all.
    The subcommittee, over a long period from January to March this year, summoned Secretary of State Rusk and other officials, as well as so-called American "experts" on China, more than thirty people in total, to testify and debate the U.S.'s dead-end China policy. It presented this report, "U.S. Policy Towards Asia," based on the results of these testimonies and debates. The United States Information Agency, the official U.S. news agency, broadcast an abstract of this report on the 20th.
    The report had to admit in its conclusion that the Chinese regime is "very stable." "China is constantly moving towards the ranks of a world power."
    "These are unparalleled accomplishments in the modern history of China, which has been plagued by disasters for more than a century."
    The report said that despite the U.S.'s so-called "tremendous nuclear military power" and "highly developed industrial system," its ability to "influence the course of events on the Asian continent is very limited, and this ability is likely to decline in the future as Communist China gains more and more of the hallmarks of a first-class power."
    The report said, "Because of Communist China's geographical location, its growing strength and capabilities, and its historical position on the Asian continent, it has an inherent advantage compared to any distant, non-Asian country."
    The report admitted that the U.S.'s hope of using "containment" to promote "peaceful evolution" in China has failed. It said, "Domestically, China has provided almost no opportunities—opportunities that currently exist in countries such as Eastern Europe—to encourage evolution toward liberalization." The report falsely claimed that the U.S.'s blockade and embargo of China "hindered the country's progress toward its industrialization goals," but also said that this would not make China "stop" moving forward.
    The report shows that although they have been battered and bruised, the Washington imperialist lords are not going to change their granite heads. In order to continue to carry out its hostile policy towards China and prepare public opinion for the U.S. to launch aggression against China, the report rehashed the old tune of the Chinese "threat" and emphasized the need to "correct" the "tendency of each to act on its own" in the China policies of the U.S.'s "allies," and also wants to hold on to that already collapsing anti-China front.
    In order for the countries around China to follow the U.S. in opposing China and to control them through this, the report viciously slandered China, saying that if one thinks that the "threat" presented by China "will disappear," it is not only "foolish but also extremely dangerous." The report fabricated a so-called "double threat" posed by China, namely "threatening the U.S.'s military arrangements in the Western Pacific and the Far East" and "threatening the economic and political development of countries around the mainland within the scope of independence and peaceful cooperation." At the same time, the report also wants Western European "allies" to bear a greater burden for the U.S.'s anti-China adventure. The report said, "It is highly doubtful whether it is wise, and ultimately whether it is possible, for the United States to continue to fulfill these heavy responsibilities in the next decade or longer with only extremely limited assistance and cooperation from our European allies." The report put pressure on the U.S.'s allies, talking at length about how "we believe that the vital interests of the entire Western family of nations are intertwined with this region (the Far East), and that in addition to the need for a fairer distribution of the burden of maintaining peace, there is also an urgent need for greater harmony and unity among us in our attitudes toward Red China." The report clamored, "We advocate that the task of formulating effective ways to correct the tendency of each to act on its own that has begun to emerge in the relations between Western industrialized countries and Communist China and in their policies toward it should be given the highest priority." The report angrily shouted at those countries that do not listen to U.S. commands, saying that the motto "United we stand, divided we fall" "certainly applies to this situation."
    The report once again put forward the policy of so-called "containment without isolation" toward China. It clamored that, in the long run, the realization of "peace" in Asia depends on the "success" of the U.S.'s efforts to "deter communist aggression." "It is unrealistic to expect to achieve this goal without making Communist China understand that aggression will never go unchallenged." At the same time, the report also claimed that "efforts should continue" to expand "limited peaceful contact" with China in order to promote "peaceful evolution" in China. The report emphasized that although the U.S.'s past efforts in this regard have failed, it "should not be discouraged by this situation."
    This report from the U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee reflects the great failure of the U.S.'s policy of aggression and interference in China, showing that the U.S. has fallen into a dead end.

### 美帝“遏制”政策阻挡不了中国巨人前进

    美帝“遏制”政策阻挡不了中国巨人前进
    美国众议院发表一项研究报告，承认美国反华政策彻底破产，中国革命政权“很牢固”，中国人民已取得“无可伦比的成就”，美国没有希望促使中国“和平演变”。但它又叫嚷要组织反华阵线，并鼓吹继续推行“和平演变”政策。这说明，尽管美国反华政策已经彻底破产，但是它决不甘心失败，仍将继续捣乱。
    新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国众议院远东和太平洋问题小组委员会提出了一份“美国对亚洲的政策”的报告，不得不承认自从新中国成立十七年来，美国政府一直奉行的顽固敌视中国人民的政策彻底破产了。美国对中国的遏制、禁运、封锁等等，不仅无损于中国人民的一根毫毛，相反的，中国人民“取得了无可伦比的成就”。
    但是，报告表明，美国统治集团要继续在敌视中国的政策的死胡同里打转，根本不会改变它仇视中国人民的立场。
    这个小组委员会在从今年一月到三月的长时间里，曾经召集国务卿腊斯克和其他官员以及美国的所谓中国问题“专家”共三十多人，就美国走投无路的对华政策作证和进行辩论。它根据这些作证和辩论的结果提出了这项“美国对亚洲的政策”的报告。美国官方新闻机构美国新闻处在二十日摘要播发了这个报告。
    报告在结论中不得不承认，中国政权“很牢固”。“中国正在不断朝世界大国的行列前进”。
  “这是在一个多世纪来的灾患重重的中国近代史上无可伦比的成就”。
    报告说，尽管美国有所谓“巨大的核军事力量”和“高度发展的工业体系”，但是，它想“影响亚洲大陆局势发展的过程的能力实在是很有限的，而且今后随着共产党中国得到越来越多的头等大国的标志，这种能力很可能会下降”。
    报告说，“由于共产党中国的地理位置、它的日益增长的力量和能力，它在亚洲大陆的历史地位，同任何遥远的、非亚洲国家比较起来，它都具有一种内在的优势。”
    报告承认，美国企图以“遏制”促使在中国发生“和平演变”的希望落空了。它说，“在国内，中国几乎没有提供任何机会——这种机会目前在例如东欧等国家是存在的——来鼓励朝自由化方向演变”。报告胡吹美国对中国的封锁禁运“阻挠了这个国家朝工业化目标的进展”，但是又说这不会使中国“停止”前进。
    报告表明，虽然已经碰得鼻青脸肿，但是华盛顿的帝国主义老爷们却是不会改变他们的花岗岩头脑的。为了继续执行敌视中国的政策，并为美国发动对中国的侵略作舆论准备，报告重弹中国“威胁”的老调，并且强调要“纠正”美国的“盟国”在对华政策中“各自为政的倾向”，还想守住那早已颓塌了的反华阵线。
    为了要中国周围的国家追随美国反华并借此来控制它们，报告大肆诬蔑中国，说什么如果认为中国“所呈现的威胁”“会消除”，不仅“是愚蠢的，也是极其危险的”。报告捏造了一个所谓中国造成的“双重威胁”，即“威胁到美国在西太平洋和远东地区的军事安排”和“威胁到大陆周围的各国在独立与和平合作范围内的经济和政治发展”。同时，报告还要西欧“盟国”对美国的反华冒险事业承担更大负担。报告说，“美国在今后十年或更长的时间里继续在只得到我们欧洲的盟国极其有限的援助和合作的情况下履行这些沉重的职责是否明智，而且最终是否做得到，对此十分怀疑”。报告对美国的盟国施加压力，大讲什么“我们认为整个西方国家大家庭的切身利益同这里（远东）是牵连着的，并且认为除了需要比较公平地分配维护和平的负担外，还迫切需要我们大家对赤色中国的态度上取得更大程度的和谐一致”。报告叫嚷说，“我们主张，把制定出有效办法来纠正在西方工业国家同共产党中国的关系中和对它的政策上开始出现的各自为政的倾向这项任务，放在最优先的地位”。报告对那些不听美国指挥的国家气冲冲地叫喊说，“团结则存，分裂则亡”这句格言“肯定地适用于这一情势”。
    报告再次提出了对中国所谓“遏制而不予孤立”的政策。它叫嚷，从长远说，在亚洲实现“和平”取决美国“阻遏共产主义侵略”的努力的“成功”。“期望在没有使共产党中国了解到侵略决不会不受抗击之前能达到这种目标，是不现实的”。同时，报告又声称“应该继续努力”，扩大同中国的“有限的和平接触”，以图在中国促进“和平演变”。报告强调，尽管美国过去在这方面的努力失败了，但是“不应由于这种情况而泄气”。
    美国众议院小组委员会的这个报告，反映了美国对华侵略和干涉政策的大失败，说明美国已经陷入一个走投无路的绝境。
