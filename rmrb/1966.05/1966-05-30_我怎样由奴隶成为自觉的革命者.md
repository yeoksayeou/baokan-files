    How I Became a Conscious Revolutionary From a Slave
    Xiao Zifu (Wa nationality), Deputy Secretary of the CPC Cangyuan Wa Autonomous County Committee, Yunnan Province
    In the old society, I was a Wa slave, not understanding what the motherland was, what the world was, let alone the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. After liberation, through the Party's training and education, and studying Chairman Mao's works, my eyes were opened, I saw the world, and I began to understand that to make revolution, one cannot be separated from the Communist Party, and one cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought.

            From Slave to Communist Party Member
    I was born in the most remote Awa Mountains of the motherland. When I was five years old, my parents were successively persecuted to death by the chieftain, and I was forced to go to the chieftain's house to herd cattle and horses, becoming a slave. Living in a cowshed, eating wild vegetables, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. In 1953, the government opened primary schools in our district, mobilizing children from various villages to go to school. At that time, people did not understand what schooling was all about, and coupled with the enemy's rumors, many people dared not send their children to school. The chieftain saw that I was an orphan and sent me to school as a "substitute for corv√©e labor." I was already a seventeen-year-old young man that year, but I was only in the first grade. In 1954, the government sent me to the Yunnan Nationalities Institute to study. At the Nationalities Institute, I studied the Party's ethnic policies, and through the speaking-bitterness movement, I began to understand what oppression and exploitation were, and who supported whom. During the speaking-bitterness, recalling the suffering I endured in the chieftain's house after my parents were persecuted to death, I cried for three days and three nights. When my parents died, they left behind a silver necklace and a bracelet. When the chieftain found out, he seized the necklace, deceived me into giving him the bracelet, and even released a dog to bite me, preventing me from getting out of bed for several months. However, at that time, I only knew that this was a punishment from ghosts and gods, and that it was deserved. After speaking-bitterness, I studied Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and I realized that this was class oppression. The Tusi and chieftains were bloodsuckers of the Wa people, and only by overthrowing the chieftains could the slaves turn over, and it was the Communist Party that led the slaves to turn over. After a period of education on the basic knowledge of the Party, and through the practice of revolutionary struggle, my class consciousness was raised, and in June 1955, I became a Communist Party member.

    From Gratitude to Conscious Revolution
    After I was liberated politically and economically, I deeply thanked the Party and Chairman Mao. In order to repay the Party's kindness, I worked hard, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue.
    Because I only had the idea of repaying kindness and lacked a firm revolutionary will, I was sometimes like a thatched hut without a main beam, swaying with the wind. In 1957, the organization sent me to work with the chieftains. I did not fully understand the policy of reforming the chieftains, and I could not correctly understand and treat the reactionary chieftains' resistance to reform, and I was unwilling to work with the chieftains. I asked to join the People's Liberation Army and have a good fight with the enemy. Due to work needs, the leadership did not approve my request to join the army.

    In 1960, I went to visit Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing and other places with some comrades. I met our great leader Chairman Mao. During the visits, I listened to the introductions of factory and commune histories from various places, and studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "On the Chongqing Negotiations," which gradually made me understand our great country and great Party, especially Chairman Mao's wise leadership, which enabled the Chinese revolution to achieve great victories. At the same time, I began to understand that the victory of the Chinese revolution did not come easily, but was achieved through arduous and tortuous struggles, and was exchanged for the bloodshed and sacrifice of many people. Comparing with all parts of the country, I felt that the construction of our region was very backward and needed continuous revolution. I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on dealing with difficulties, which greatly strengthened my confidence in overcoming difficulties, and I began to feel that it was impossible to make revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works.

    Because I had not properly carried out self-transformation after joining the Party, my individualism not only did not get overcome, but also developed to some extent under certain conditions. I thought that I came from a good background, and that I had not made any major mistakes since I started working, so I unconsciously revealed a sense of superiority. In 1962, in order to meet the needs of the work, the organization transferred me to the Organization Department of the county party committee to serve as the director, and individualism developed quite prominently. I was very calculating in my life, complaining about the poor housing, complaining about working in the same office with the clerks, which was a bit "unseemly," and my work was not as thorough as when I was in the district.

    At this time, it was the nationwide upsurge of studying the People's Liberation Army and studying Chairman Mao's works. I also went to study Chairman Mao's works with the above problems. I repeatedly read articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Our team is entirely for the purpose of liberating the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." But what about me? Only thinking about myself, isn't this going against Chairman Mao's teachings? I recalled my past slave life, eating half a bowl of leftover soup and vegetables a day, not getting enough to eat, not getting enough to wear, and living in a cowshed. When I first started working, I got twenty or thirty yuan a month, and I was still very happy. But now, I have enough to eat and wear, and my salary is higher than before, and I am still not satisfied. The more I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," the more I felt sorry for the Party, and I shed tears of shame. I made up my mind to study Chairman Mao's works well, transform my thinking, and improve my work.

    From Sitting in the Office to Going Deep Among the Masses
    In 1964 and 1965, I went down to stay in selected spots and shared weal and woe with the masses. In the previous years, because my thoughts and feelings had changed, I complained more about the backward habits in production and life of my Wa class brothers and sisters, and helped less. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I went to stay in Shangzhai Village, Baka Township. The dry land there was still slash-and-burn cultivation, and the grain yield per mu was only over 100 jin. In order to increase the yield per mu and fix the cultivated land, I helped them introduce some "Southwest 175" improved rice varieties for trial. At that time, cadres and commune members were unwilling to try planting, fearing it would be labor-intensive, fearing reduced yields, unwilling to provide labor, and unwilling to provide fertilizer, so I and the comrades in the work team personally tried planting three mu, and the yield per mu increased from the original 220 jin to more than 770 jin. During the autumn harvest, the cadres and commune members saw that the rice in our experimental fields was growing well, and they asked us for seeds. Last year, more than 20 mu were planted here, and the surrounding villages were also motivated.

    Later, I went to stay in Nansa Township. The natural conditions in this township are poor. The entire township has 948 people, only over 100 mu of paddy fields. Before 1964, they had to rely on the state to supply grain every year. I was determined to change the face of Nansa together with the masses there. I and the cadres visited Chen Ageamu, a five-guarantee household and a Wa commune member. This old woman is 57 years old, without children. Although the commune takes care of her with more than 500 jin of grain, her house is broken and has not been repaired, she has no salt to eat, and her life is very difficult. When I visited her for the second time, I bought salt and tea and sent them to her. Afterwards, the cadres also sent people to help her repair the house. The old woman said with tears in her eyes: "Before liberation, after my husband died, the land and property were all robbed by the chieftain. Today, only Chairman Mao's cadres care about me like this." Later, I learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants that the masses had demands for controlling mountains and rivers, and I was determined to help them realize this wish. I and the township cadres went up the mountain to find water, climbing every mountain top in the entire township, and found twelve ravine water sources. After the water sources were found, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. With one heart from top to bottom, united as one, they completed the task of building reservoirs and digging ditches in just over a month. The entire project did not ask the state for a penny.

    The stay in Nansa played a certain role in guiding the work on the surface. However, what is more important is that the revolutionary spirit of the Nansa people, who are not afraid of difficulties and dare to struggle, has educated me. I felt that I had done too little for the masses in the past. I realized that serving the people is unlimited, and I must make up my mind to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and strive for the rest of my life to change the backward state of production, culture and life in the border areas.
