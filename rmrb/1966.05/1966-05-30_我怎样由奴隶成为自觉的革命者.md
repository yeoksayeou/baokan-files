    How I Became a Conscious Revolutionary From a Slave
    Xiao Zifu (Wa nationality), Deputy Secretary of the CPC Cangyuan Wa Autonomous County Committee, Yunnan Province
    In the old society, I was a Wa slave, not understanding what the motherland was, what the world was, let alone the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. After liberation, through the Party's training and education, and studying Chairman Mao's works, my eyes were opened, I saw the world, and I began to understand that to make revolution, one cannot be separated from the Communist Party, and one cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought.

            From Slave to Communist Party Member
    I was born in the most remote Awa Mountains of the motherland. When I was five years old, my parents were successively persecuted to death by the chieftain, and I was forced to go to the chieftain's house to herd cattle and horses, becoming a slave. Living in a cowshed, eating wild vegetables, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. In 1953, the government opened primary schools in our district, mobilizing children from various villages to go to school. At that time, people did not understand what schooling was all about, and coupled with the enemy's rumors, many people dared not send their children to school. The chieftain saw that I was an orphan and sent me to school as a "substitute for corvée labor." I was already a seventeen-year-old young man that year, but I was only in the first grade. In 1954, the government sent me to the Yunnan Nationalities Institute to study. At the Nationalities Institute, I studied the Party's ethnic policies, and through the speaking-bitterness movement, I began to understand what oppression and exploitation were, and who supported whom. During the speaking-bitterness, recalling the suffering I endured in the chieftain's house after my parents were persecuted to death, I cried for three days and three nights. When my parents died, they left behind a silver necklace and a bracelet. When the chieftain found out, he seized the necklace, deceived me into giving him the bracelet, and even released a dog to bite me, preventing me from getting out of bed for several months. However, at that time, I only knew that this was a punishment from ghosts and gods, and that it was deserved. After speaking-bitterness, I studied Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and I realized that this was class oppression. The Tusi and chieftains were bloodsuckers of the Wa people, and only by overthrowing the chieftains could the slaves turn over, and it was the Communist Party that led the slaves to turn over. After a period of education on the basic knowledge of the Party, and through the practice of revolutionary struggle, my class consciousness was raised, and in June 1955, I became a Communist Party member.

    From Gratitude to Conscious Revolution
    After I was liberated politically and economically, I deeply thanked the Party and Chairman Mao. In order to repay the Party's kindness, I worked hard, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue.
    Because I only had the idea of repaying kindness and lacked a firm revolutionary will, I was sometimes like a thatched hut without a main beam, swaying with the wind. In 1957, the organization sent me to work with the chieftains. I did not fully understand the policy of reforming the chieftains, and I could not correctly understand and treat the reactionary chieftains' resistance to reform, and I was unwilling to work with the chieftains. I asked to join the People's Liberation Army and have a good fight with the enemy. Due to work needs, the leadership did not approve my request to join the army.

    In 1960, I went to visit Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing and other places with some comrades. I met our great leader Chairman Mao. During the visits, I listened to the introductions of factory and commune histories from various places, and studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "On the Chongqing Negotiations," which gradually made me understand our great country and great Party, especially Chairman Mao's wise leadership, which enabled the Chinese revolution to achieve great victories. At the same time, I began to understand that the victory of the Chinese revolution did not come easily, but was achieved through arduous and tortuous struggles, and was exchanged for the bloodshed and sacrifice of many people. Comparing with all parts of the country, I felt that the construction of our region was very backward and needed continuous revolution. I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on dealing with difficulties, which greatly strengthened my confidence in overcoming difficulties, and I began to feel that it was impossible to make revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works.

    Because I had not properly carried out self-transformation after joining the Party, my individualism not only did not get overcome, but also developed to some extent under certain conditions. I thought that I came from a good background, and that I had not made any major mistakes since I started working, so I unconsciously revealed a sense of superiority. In 1962, in order to meet the needs of the work, the organization transferred me to the Organization Department of the county party committee to serve as the director, and individualism developed quite prominently. I was very calculating in my life, complaining about the poor housing, complaining about working in the same office with the clerks, which was a bit "unseemly," and my work was not as thorough as when I was in the district.

    At this time, it was the nationwide upsurge of studying the People's Liberation Army and studying Chairman Mao's works. I also went to study Chairman Mao's works with the above problems. I repeatedly read articles such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "Our team is entirely for the purpose of liberating the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." But what about me? Only thinking about myself, isn't this going against Chairman Mao's teachings? I recalled my past slave life, eating half a bowl of leftover soup and vegetables a day, not getting enough to eat, not getting enough to wear, and living in a cowshed. When I first started working, I got twenty or thirty yuan a month, and I was still very happy. But now, I have enough to eat and wear, and my salary is higher than before, and I am still not satisfied. The more I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," the more I felt sorry for the Party, and I shed tears of shame. I made up my mind to study Chairman Mao's works well, transform my thinking, and improve my work.

    From Sitting in the Office to Going Deep Among the Masses
    In 1964 and 1965, I went down to stay in selected spots and shared weal and woe with the masses. In the previous years, because my thoughts and feelings had changed, I complained more about the backward habits in production and life of my Wa class brothers and sisters, and helped less. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I went to stay in Shangzhai Village, Baka Township. The dry land there was still slash-and-burn cultivation, and the grain yield per mu was only over 100 jin. In order to increase the yield per mu and fix the cultivated land, I helped them introduce some "Southwest 175" improved rice varieties for trial. At that time, cadres and commune members were unwilling to try planting, fearing it would be labor-intensive, fearing reduced yields, unwilling to provide labor, and unwilling to provide fertilizer, so I and the comrades in the work team personally tried planting three mu, and the yield per mu increased from the original 220 jin to more than 770 jin. During the autumn harvest, the cadres and commune members saw that the rice in our experimental fields was growing well, and they asked us for seeds. Last year, more than 20 mu were planted here, and the surrounding villages were also motivated.

    Later, I went to stay in Nansa Township. The natural conditions in this township are poor. The entire township has 948 people, only over 100 mu of paddy fields. Before 1964, they had to rely on the state to supply grain every year. I was determined to change the face of Nansa together with the masses there. I and the cadres visited Chen Ageamu, a five-guarantee household and a Wa commune member. This old woman is 57 years old, without children. Although the commune takes care of her with more than 500 jin of grain, her house is broken and has not been repaired, she has no salt to eat, and her life is very difficult. When I visited her for the second time, I bought salt and tea and sent them to her. Afterwards, the cadres also sent people to help her repair the house. The old woman said with tears in her eyes: "Before liberation, after my husband died, the land and property were all robbed by the chieftain. Today, only Chairman Mao's cadres care about me like this." Later, I learned from the poor and lower-middle peasants that the masses had demands for controlling mountains and rivers, and I was determined to help them realize this wish. I and the township cadres went up the mountain to find water, climbing every mountain top in the entire township, and found twelve ravine water sources. After the water sources were found, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. With one heart from top to bottom, united as one, they completed the task of building reservoirs and digging ditches in just over a month. The entire project did not ask the state for a penny.

    The stay in Nansa played a certain role in guiding the work on the surface. However, what is more important is that the revolutionary spirit of the Nansa people, who are not afraid of difficulties and dare to struggle, has educated me. I felt that I had done too little for the masses in the past. I realized that serving the people is unlimited, and I must make up my mind to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and strive for the rest of my life to change the backward state of production, culture and life in the border areas.

    我怎样由奴隶成为自觉的革命者
    中共云南省沧源佤族自治县县委副书记  萧子富（佤族）
    在旧社会里，我是一个佤族奴隶，不懂得什么是祖国，什么是世界，更不知道共产党、毛主席。解放后经过党的培养教育，学习了毛主席的著作，使我睁开了眼睛，看到了世界，开始懂得要革命，就离不开共产党，就离不开毛泽东思想。
            从奴隶到共产党员
    我出生在祖国最边远的阿瓦山上。五岁那年，我的父母被头人相继逼死了，我被迫去头人家里放牛放马，当了奴隶。住牛棚，吃野菜，过着牛马不如的生活。一九五三年，政府在我们区上开办小学，动员各寨的儿童去读书。那时，大家还不懂得读书是怎么一回事，加之敌人造谣，许多人不敢送孩子上学。头人看我是孤儿，就象“抵差”一样，派我去读书，那年我已经是十七岁的小伙子了，才读一年级。一九五四年，政府把我送到云南民族学院学习。在民族学院学习了党的民族政策，经过诉苦运动，使我开始懂得什么叫压迫、剥削，谁养活谁。在诉苦中，回忆父母被逼死后，我在头人家受的罪，整整哭了三天三夜。我父母死时留下一个银项圈和一个手镯。头人知道后，霸去了项圈，骗去了手镯，还放狗把我咬伤，几个月不能起床。可是，那时我只知道这是鬼神降罪，是应得的。诉苦以后，又学习了毛主席写的《中国社会各阶级的分析》，我才知道这是阶级压迫。土司、头人是佤族人民的吸血鬼，只有打倒头人，奴隶才能翻身，而领导奴隶翻身的是共产党。经过一段时间党的基本知识的教育，经过革命斗争的实践，我的阶级觉悟提高了，一九五五年六月，我成为一个共产党员。
    从报恩思想到自觉革命
    我在政治上、经济上得到解放以后，深深地感谢党和毛主席。为了报答党的恩情，我在工作中埋头苦干，不怕苦、不怕累。
    由于我只有报恩思想，缺乏坚定的革命意志，有时就象没有主梁的茅屋一样，风一吹就摇摆。一九五七年组织上派我去做头人的工作，我对改造头人的政策，理解不全面，对反动头人的对抗改造，不能正确的认识和对待，不愿做头人工作。我要求去参加解放军，痛痛快快地跟敌人干一场。由于工作需要，领导上没有批准我参军的要求。
    一九六○年，我随一些同志去北京、天津、沈阳、重庆等地参观。我见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。在参观中，我一边听了各地介绍厂史、社史，一边学习毛主席《关于重庆谈判》等文章，使我逐步了解我们伟大的国家、伟大的党，特别是毛主席的英明领导使中国革命取得巨大的胜利，同时也开始懂得中国革命的胜利来之不易，是经过了艰苦曲折斗争才取得的，经过了多少人流血牺牲才换来的。对照全国各地，我感到我们地区的建设很落后，还需要不断革命。我学习了毛主席有关对待困难的教导，又大大增强了我克服困难的信心，我开始感到，要革命不学习毛主席著作不行。
    由于我入党以后没有好好地进行自我改造，我的个人主义思想不但没有得到克服，在一定条件下还有所发展。我认为自己出身好，参加工作以来没有犯过大错误，就不自觉地流露出一种优越感。一九六二年，组织上为了工作需要，把我调到县委组织部担任部长，个人主义发展得相当突出。生活上斤斤计较，嫌住房不好，嫌和干事在一个办公室办公，有点“不象话”，工作也不如在区上深入了。
    这时，正是全国大学解放军，大学毛主席著作的高潮。我也带着以上问题去学习毛主席著作。我反复读了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》等文章。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”可是我呢？只考虑自己，这不正是与毛主席的教导背道而驰了吗？我回忆了自己过去的奴隶生活，一天半瓢残汤剩菜，吃不饱，穿不暖，还住牛棚。刚参加工作时，一个月拿二、三十元，我还兴高采烈。而现在呢，吃饱、穿暖，工资比过去也增多了，还不满足。我越学习《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》，就越觉得对不起党，我惭愧地淌了眼泪。我下决心好好学习毛主席著作，改造思想，改进工作。
    从坐办公室到深入群众
    一九六四年和一九六五年，我下去蹲点，和群众同甘共苦。前几年，我由于思想感情变了，对佤族阶级兄弟的生产、生活上的落后习惯，抱怨得多，帮助得少。学习毛主席著作后，我到坝卡乡上寨蹲点，那里旱地仍然是刀耕火种，粮食单产只有一百多斤。为了提高单产，固定耕地，我帮助他们引进了一些“西南175”水稻良种作试验。当时干部、社员都不愿意试种，怕费工，怕减产，不愿出劳动力，不愿出肥料，我就和工作组的同志亲自动手试种了三亩，单产由原来的二百二十斤提高到七百七十多斤。秋收时，干部、社员看到我们试验田的水稻长得好，纷纷向我们要种子，去年这里栽了二十多亩，并把周围的寨子也带动起来了。
    后来，我又到南撒乡蹲点。这个乡的自然条件较差，全乡九百四十八人，只有一百多亩水田，一九六四年以前，每年都要靠国家供应粮食。我决心要和那里的群众一起改变南撒面貌。我和干部一道，访问了五保户、瓦族社员陈阿戛木。这个老人，五十七岁，无儿无女。社里虽然照顾她五百多斤粮食，但是她的房子破了还没有修，吃的盐巴也没有了，生活过得很不好。我第二次访问她时，就买了盐巴、茶叶送去，随后，干部也派人帮助她修补了房子。老人含着眼泪说：“解放前，我丈夫死后，田地财产都被头人抢走了。今天只有毛主席的干部，才这样关心我。”后来，我又从贫下中农中了解到群众有治山治水的要求，我决心帮助他们实现这个愿望。我和乡干部上山找水，爬遍了全乡每个山头，找到了十二股箐水。水源找到后，群众积极性很高。上下一条心，团结一致，只一个多月时间就完成了兴修坝塘和开挖水沟的任务，整个工程没向国家要一分钱。
    通过南撒的蹲点，对指导面上的工作起了一定的作用。但是，更重要的是南撒人不怕困难，敢于斗争的革命精神教育了我。我感到过去为群众做的事情太少了。我认识到，为人民服务是无限的，要下决心读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，要象焦裕禄同志那样，一心为革命，一心为人民，为改变边疆生产、文化和生活的落后状况而奋斗一辈子。
