    Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, 17th. Sudanese writers, at an evening gathering held here on the 16th to welcome the Chinese Writers Delegation, expressed their love for Chairman Mao.
    One Sudanese writer said, "We believe that Chairman Mao is the sun for the Chinese people." Another Sudanese writer said, "Chairman Mao is not only the great revolutionary leader of the Chinese people, but also the great poet of our time."
    At the request of the Sudanese writers, Chinese writer Gao Ying recited Chairman Mao's poem "Huanxi Sha – Responding to Mr. Liu Yazi" in Chinese. After listening to the recitation, the Sudanese writers said that although they did not understand Chinese, they could appreciate the poem's deep emotion. Then, Sudanese writer Muhammad Mahdi recited a portion of the poem in English, and another writer, Mustafa, recited the poem in Arabic. Their recitations reminded the writers of the common experiences and sufferings of the people of both countries during the period of imperialist aggression.
    At the second request of the Sudanese writers, Gao Ying recited another of Chairman Mao's poems, "Qinyuanchun – Snow." His recitation enlivened the atmosphere of the evening. Then, Sudanese writer Abdullah composed an impromptu poem. The gist of the poem was: We yearn to see the distant East; we fly like birds in the sky above the sea. We have seen country after country; but we are deeply attracted by a great country—China, where we have seen a bright sky and a brilliant sun.
    The evening gathering was held in a park on the banks of the Nile. At the gathering, writers from both countries introduced the past and present literary and artistic situation in their respective countries, and exchanged views on many issues. Sudanese writers warmly praised the great achievements China has recently made in reforming Chinese literature and art, especially in reforming the Chinese drama movement.
    This evening gathering, filled with friendship, did not end until late at night. At parting, the Sudanese and Chinese writers were reluctant to leave. One Chinese writer pointed to the Nile River and said, "This is the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The two Niles advance together after their confluence. The writers and people of our two countries should always be like the two Niles in the anti-imperialist struggle."
    The Chinese Writers Delegation, led by Du Xuan, arrived here on the 16th. This is the first Chinese writers delegation to visit Sudan.

    苏丹作家赋诗歌颂中国明朗的天空和光辉的太阳
    毛主席是中国人民的太阳
    在喀土穆的晚会上，苏丹作家赞扬我文学艺术和戏剧改革成就
    新华社喀土穆十七日电　苏丹作家十六日在这里为欢迎中国作家代表团而举行的晚会上，表示热爱毛主席。
    一位苏丹作家说：“我们认为毛泽东主席是中国人民的太阳。”另一位苏丹作家说：“毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民的伟大革命领袖，而且也是当代的伟大诗人。”
    中国作家高缨应苏丹作家的请求，用汉语朗诵了毛主席的词《浣溪沙——和柳亚子先生》。苏丹作家听了朗诵后说，虽然他们不懂汉语，但是能够体会到这首词的浓厚感情。接着，苏丹作家穆罕默德·马赫迪用英语朗诵了这首词的一部分，另一作家穆斯塔法用阿拉伯语朗诵了这首词，他们的朗诵使作家们回想起两国人民遭受帝国主义侵略时期的共同遭遇和苦难。
    高缨应苏丹作家的第二次请求，朗诵了毛主席的另一首词《沁园春——雪》。他的朗诵使晚会气氛活跃起来。然后，苏丹作家阿卜杜拉作了一首即兴诗。这首诗的大意是：我们渴望看到遥远的东方；我们象小鸟般在大海上空飞翔。我们看到过一个又一个国家；但是我们被一个伟大的国家——中国深深吸引住了，我们在那里看到了明朗的天空和光辉的太阳。
    晚会在尼罗河畔公园里举行。会上两国的作家互相介绍了本国过去和目前的文学艺术情况，还就许多问题交换了意见。苏丹作家热烈赞扬中国最近在改革中国文学艺术，尤其在改革中国戏剧运动中所取得的巨大成就。
    这个充满了友谊的晚会，到深夜才结束。临别时，苏丹和中国两国作家依依不舍。一位中国作家指着尼罗河说：“这里是白尼罗河和青尼罗河的会合处。两条尼罗河在会合后一起前进。我们两国的作家和人民在反帝斗争中应该永远象两条尼罗河那样。”
    由杜宣率领的中国作家代表团是十六日到达这里的。这是第一个中国作家代表团访问苏丹。
