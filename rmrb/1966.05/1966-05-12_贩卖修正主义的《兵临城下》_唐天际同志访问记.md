    *Battleship Potemkin*: A Revisionist Work that Peddles Revisionism
    ——An Interview with Comrade Tang Tianji
    As the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are vehemently denouncing the poisonous weed *Battleship Potemkin*, which glorifies the enemy and promotes revisionist ideology, our reporter interviewed Comrade Tang Tianji, Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department of the People’s Liberation Army. During the Northeast Liberation War, Comrade Tang Tianji was a responsible comrade in one of our army's units. He participated in the famous Liaoshen Campaign and led the work of the "peaceful liberation" of Changchun. He is quite familiar with the revolutionary situation and the enemy-us struggle during the Northeast Liberation War, the background of the film's story, and our army's political work to win over and disintegrate the enemy forces.
    Comrade Tang Tianji, based on his personal combat experience and his understanding of Chairman Mao's military thought, sternly criticized this film.
    He said: The film depicts the story of the uprising of Chiang's troops in a certain city during the Northeast Liberation War. In the entire Northeast Liberation War, there were only two major uprisings of regular troops: one was the battlefield uprising of a certain division in Haicheng, and the other was the uprising of some of Chiang's troops in Changchun. The film is mainly based on the "peaceful liberation" of Changchun during the Northeast Liberation War (see the "Postscript" of the play of the same name). Let's talk about the general process of liberating Changchun.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, according to Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of establishing rural base areas, encircling the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities, we penetrated into the vast rural areas of Northeast China. After more than two years of arduous struggle, we greatly opened up the situation in Northeast China, fundamentally changed the situation in Northeast China, and our army shifted from strategic defense to strategic counter-offensive, forcing the enemy forces to be isolated in several strongholds such as Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou. Changchun was the farthest strategic stronghold of the enemy forces in Northeast China, with 100,000 troops gathered inside and outside the city. In terms of equipment, most of it was American-made; in terms of fortifications, most of it was reinforced concrete. However, under the gradual compression and heavy blows of our army, they fled to Changchun in a panic, becoming isolated islands on land and turtles in a jar. A few days before the liberation of Changchun, Jinzhou was also captured by our army, annihilating 100,000 main enemy forces, and the middle section of the Beining Line was occupied by our army. The entire enemy forces in Northeast China were already under our army's heavy encirclement. Chiang Kai-shek rushed to Shenyang, attempting to save the critical situation in Northeast China, and forced the enemy defending Changchun to break through the siege and abandon the city completely. On the issue of breaking through, due to the enemy troops' greed for life and fear of death, there were contradictions between breaking through first and breaking through later, and the enemy troops were in a situation of many contradictions and disintegration. At this time, our army completely mastered the initiative militarily, and at the same time, strengthened its political offensive. Seeing that the general trend was gone, the enemy defending Changchun, in a situation of last resort, successively revolted and surrendered from September 17th to 19th, 1948. Thus, Changchun was completely liberated.
    What does the uprising and surrender of some of Chiang's troops in Changchun illustrate? Was it the result of the enemy's great kindness? Was it the result of the enemy's self-disintegration? Was it the result of our army's humanistic influence? No. The history of the liberation of Changchun clearly tells us: the enemy's uprising was the result of a fundamental change in the balance of power between the enemy and us, the result of our army's pressure with overwhelming force, and the result of our army's implementation of military encirclement, political offensives, and economic blockade. The liberation of Changchun during the Liaoshen Campaign was the first major city liberated in the People's Liberation War, and was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.
    The liberation of Changchun also illustrates that the enemy troops will not easily revolt and surrender. Their class nature determines this point. As long as they still have capital, still have territory, and still have hope of struggling, they will wait and see, delay, or resist stubbornly. When their capital is almost lost and they see that there is no hope of struggling any further, under the active influence of our army's political work, they may possibly revolt. The situation in Changchun was like this, the situation in Haicheng was like this, and the situation of the enemy troops who revolted in other places was roughly the same. From the Northeast to Hainan Island, we traveled through more than a dozen provinces and dealt with many enemy troops. However, the situation of the enemy troops' uprising and surrender was largely the same. If the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army's broom does not reach them and influence them, the enemy will not disintegrate and revolt on their own. *Battleship Potemkin* is mainly based on the "peaceful liberation" of Changchun, but it completely violates the historical truth. In this film, we cannot see the great scene of the people's war, the powerful power of our army's severe military strikes and political offensives against the enemy, and the various vigorous activities of the broad masses of people supporting the People's Liberation War and fighting against the enemy. What we see are some scenes that beautify, sympathize with, and praise the Kuomintang reactionaries. This obliterates the essence of the great people's war, covers up the enemy's anti-communist and anti-people class nature, and seriously distorts the history of the People's Liberation War.
    Comrade Tang Tianji said: I watched this film once last year and felt that the tone was wrong. I raised my opinions at that time. This time, after re-screening, I watched it again and saw the problems more clearly. I feel that when sternly criticizing this film, it is very beneficial to review Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and earnestly study Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." In this article, Chairman Mao made the most comprehensive and correct historical summary of the three ways to resolve the Kuomintang army. A literary and artistic work with the Liberation War as its background and expressing the work of disintegrating the enemy army must take Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding ideology. However, the film completely deviates from Mao Zedong Thought.
    Chairman Mao taught us in his "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" that the so-called peaceful method is to "force the enemy army to be quickly and thoroughly reorganized into the People's Liberation Army according to the system of the People's Liberation Army by peaceful means." Since it is "forced," it must be backed by our army's powerful armed forces, or against the background of a fundamental change in the balance of power between the enemy and us. Does the film *Battleship Potemkin* show the "forcing" of our army's military power? No. From the film, we cannot feel the powerful momentum and pressure created by 100,000 troops besieging the city at all. 1947 was a great historical turning point in the Chinese People's Liberation War. Chairman Mao said: "Now is the time when all enemies at home and abroad are dominated by their pessimistic sentiments." However, the enemy troops in the film are not "sighing and groaning," but are high-spirited; they are not "crying out for crisis," but are holding banquets and dance parties, and are calm and composed. From the spirited mood of the enemy troops, can we see any fundamental change in the balance of power between the enemy and us? Can we see any strong pressure created by the siege of the city? The film is titled *Battleship Potemkin*, but it does not show the decisive role of our army's armed struggle in forcing the enemy troops to revolt. Although Zhao Chongwu, a senior officer of the enemy army, said that the city was surrounded by our 100,000 troops, he optimistically said: "When two tigers fight, the outcome is undecided. Even if the National Army retreats to the south of the Yangtze River, it will still have half of the country." Although Zheng Hanchen, a mid-level officer of the enemy army, was captured by our army, he said without fear: "I will never surrender!" Although a small soldier of the enemy army was captured by our army three times, he didn't care and still went back to be his soldier. The three types of characters in the enemy army, upper, middle, and lower, did not feel that the general trend was inevitable and that they were at the end of their rope, let alone feel that uprising and surrendering was the only way out. Can we conclude from this that the enemy's uprising was the result of our army's forcing? Negating the decisive role of the gun barrel in solving problems is the fundamental mistake of the film.
    Chairman Mao taught us in this article that the "Beiping method" is a form of struggle, a bloodless form of struggle, and it does not mean that problems can be solved without struggle. The so-called political struggle in the film has neither the "struggle" of tit-for-tat nor the "fight" of adhering to principles. For Zheng Hanchen, a die-hard enemy officer who clamored to "succeed or die," Jiang, the minister of our army's liaison department, completely lost his revolutionary stance, first softening him by beautifying his history, and then stimulating his "gratitude" with the "magnanimous" "kindness of not killing." For Zhao Chongwu, a senior general of the enemy army who clamored that "even if the National Army retreats to the south of the Yangtze River, it will still have half of the country," Minister Jiang also completely abandoned revolutionary principles, first politically catering to and praising him, trying to make him change his mind, and then privately recalling old times emotionally, vainly hoping to make him "completely understand." Chairman Mao said that for the stubborn elements of the enemy army, only through struggle can they be made "stubborn" but not "rigid." The so-called political struggle in the film does not have any smell of gunpowder from struggle, but only the human touch of influence. Reducing the arduous struggle to disintegrate the enemy army to merely winning over a small number of upper-level figures; and in winning over these upper-level figures, extracting the content of struggle and replacing it with flattering praise and humble begging, is another serious mistake of the film.
    Chairman Mao taught us in this article that in resolving the enemy by peaceful means, "we must never think that because the counter-revolutionary forces submit to us, they have become revolutionary parties, and that their counter-revolutionary ideas and counter-revolutionary attempts no longer exist. It is definitely not like this." The film completely contradicts Chairman Mao's teachings. Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, even before they submitted to us, were already "good people" with a "glorious history" of the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance against Japan, and with a "kind heart" of caring for soldiers and caring for the people. After submitting to us, their counter-revolutionary ideas and counter-revolutionary attempts were completely swept away, and they became revolutionary heroes with their guns pointed at Hu, a confidant of Chiang Kai-shek, and shouting "Oppose your creating civil war, oppose your selling China to the Americans." Why was Minister Jiang so kind and humble to Zheng Hanchen from the beginning after he was captured, authenticating his "glorious history" and releasing him easily without struggling against his stubborn attitude? This is because he had no concept of the enemy situation in his mind at all, and placed unlimited illusions on the enemy. Why did he dare to risk going into the city to see Zheng Hanchen? This is because he believed that with his "kindness of not killing," Zheng Hanchen would definitely "repay his gratitude," and that the enemy had "good human nature." Tampering with the enemy's counter-revolutionary history, obliterating their counter-revolutionary essence, and completely standing on the enemy's side on the "primary issue of revolution" of who to praise and who to oppose.
    Chairman Mao's theory of revolutionary war is a great historical summary of the Chinese people's revolutionary war and a creative development of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "The whole world can only be transformed with guns." The course of history has fully proven Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis. However, the film *Battleship Potemkin* deviates from the scripture of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, betrays the path of people's war, and strives to beautify the enemy, promoting the idea that the enemy will collapse without being attacked, in order to abolish armed struggle. This is an artistic specimen of the reactionary "deviation from the scriptures and betrayal of the Dao" theory. This is a poisonous weed that promotes revisionism, and we must thoroughly eradicate it.

    贩卖修正主义的《兵临城下》
    ——唐天际同志访问记
    在广大工农兵群众痛斥美化敌人，宣扬修正主义思想的毒草《兵临城下》的时候，本报记者访问了解放军总后勤部副部长唐天际同志。东北解放战争时期，唐天际同志是我军某部的一位负责同志，他参加过著名的辽沈战役，参加过“和平解放”长春的领导工作，对影片故事发生的背景——东北解放战争时期的革命形势和敌我斗争的情况，对我军争取敌军和瓦解敌军的政治工作，是相当熟悉的。
    唐天际同志根据他亲身的战斗经历，根据他对毛主席军事思想的体会，严正地批判了这部影片。
    他说：影片描写的是东北解放战争中某城蒋军起义的故事。在整个东北解放战争中，只有两起大的正规军起义：一起是海城某师的战地起义，一起是长春部分蒋军的起义。影片主要取材于东北解放战争时期长春的“和平解放”（见同名话剧“后记”），这里就谈谈解放长春的大略经过吧。
    抗日战争胜利之后，我们根据毛主席关于建立农村根据地，实行农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的战略思想，深入到了东北广大的农村。经过两年多艰苦的斗争，大大地打开了东北的局面，根本改变了东北的形势，我军由战略防御转入了战略反攻，迫使敌军孤立在长春、沈阳、锦州等几个据点上。长春是东北敌军伸出最远的战略据点，城内外集结着十万兵力。论装备，大多是美式的，论工事，大多是钢筋水泥的，但在我军步步压缩和沉重打击之下，纷纷向长春狼狈麕集，成为陆上孤岛、瓮中之鳖。长春解放前几天，锦州又被我军打下，歼灭敌军十万主力，北宁线中段已为我军占领，整个东北敌军，都已处在我军重重包围之中。蒋介石急忙赶到沈阳，企图挽救东北危局，并逼令长春守敌，全部弃城突围。在突围问题上，由于敌军都贪生怕死，又产生了先突围后突围的矛盾，敌军更处于矛盾重重，分崩离析的局面。这时，我军在军事上完全掌握了主动权，同时，又加强了政治上的攻势。长春守敌，眼看大势已去，在万不得已的情况下，于一九四八年九月十七日至十九日，相继各自起义、投诚，至此，长春全部解放。
    长春部分蒋军起义投降的经过说明了什么呢？是敌军大发善心的结果吗？是敌军自行分化的结果吗？是我军人性感化的结果吗？不是。长春解放的历史，清楚地告诉我们：敌军的起义，是敌我力量对比发生了根本变化的结果，是我军大兵压境迫使的结果，是我军实行军事包围、政治攻势和经济封锁的结果。辽沈战役中长春的解放，是人民解放战争中解放的第一个大城市，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    长春的解放，也说明了敌军是不会轻易起义投降的。他们的阶级本质决定了这一点，只要他们还有本钱，还有地盘，还有挣扎的希望，他们就会观望、拖延或顽抗下去；老本快输光了，看到再挣扎下去没什么指望了，在我军政治工作积极的影响下，他们才有可能起义。长春的情况是这样，海城的情况是这样，其他地方起义敌军的情况大致也是这样。从东北打到海南岛，我们转辗了十几个省，和不少敌军打过交道，但是敌军起义投降的情况却大同小异，共产党、人民解放军的扫帚不到，影响不到，敌人没有自行分化起义的。《兵临城下》主要取材于长春的“和平解放”，却完全违背了历史的真实。在这部影片中，看不到伟大的人民战争的场面，看不到我军对敌人的严重军事打击和政治攻势的强大威力，看不到广大人民支援人民解放战争以及对敌斗争的各种轰轰烈烈的活动，看到的只是美化、同情和歌颂国民党反动派的一些场面。这就抹煞了伟大的人民战争的实质，掩盖了敌人反共反人民的阶级本质，对人民解放战争的历史作了严重的篡改。
    唐天际同志说：这部影片，我去年看过一次，感到调子不对，当时就提出了意见。这回重新放映，我又看了一次，问题也看得更清楚了。我觉得在严正批判这部影片的时候，重温一下毛主席关于人民战争的思想，认真学习一下毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，是大有好处的。在这篇文章里，毛主席对解决国民党军队的三种方式作了最全面、最正确的历史性的总结。一部以解放战争为背景，以表现瓦解敌军工作为题材的文艺作品，必须以毛泽东思想作为创作的指导思想。但是，影片却完全背离了毛泽东思想。
    毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》这篇文章里教导我们，所谓和平方式，就是“迫使敌军用和平方法，迅速地彻底地按照人民解放军的制度改编为人民解放军。”既然是“迫使”，就必须以我军强大的武装力量作后盾，或则以敌我力量对比发生了根本变化为背景。影片《兵临城下》有没有表现我军军事力量的“迫使”呢？没有，从影片里，我们根本感觉不到十万大军兵临城下所造成的强大声势和强大压力。一九四七年是中国人民解放战争伟大的历史转折点。毛主席说：“现在是一切国内外敌人都被他们的悲观情绪所统治的时候。”然而影片中的敌军不是“唉声叹气”，而是趾高气扬；不是“大叫危机”，而是摆筵席，开舞会，泰然自若。从敌军神气的情绪里，我们能看出什么敌我力量对比的根本性的变化呢？能看出什么兵临城下所造成的强大压力呢？影片名曰《兵临城下》，但没有表现我军武装斗争对于迫使敌军起义的决定性的作用。敌军的高级军官赵崇武虽然说过城市已被我十万大军所包围，但是颇为乐观地说：“两虎相争，胜负未定，纵使国军退至长江以南，也还有半壁河山。”敌军的中级军官郑汉臣虽然为我军所俘，但是临畏不惧地说：“决不投降！”敌军的下级士兵小个子兵虽然被我军俘获过三次，但是满不在乎，依然回去当他的兵。敌军的上、中、下三种人物，都没有感到大势所趋、走投无路，更不用说感到起义投诚是唯一的出路了，从这里我们能得出敌军的起义是我军迫使的结果吗？否定枪杆子解决问题的决定性的作用，这是影片根本性的错误。
    毛主席在这篇文章里教导我们，“北平方式，是一种斗争方式，是一种不流血的斗争方式，并不是不用斗争可以解决问题的。影片里的所谓政治争取，却既没有针锋相对的“斗”，也没有坚持原则的“争”。对于叫嚷“不成功便成仁”的敌军死硬派郑汉臣，我军联络部姜部长完全丧失了革命的立场，首先以美化他的历史来加以软化，接着又以“不杀之恩”的“宽大胸怀”来激发他“感恩报德”。对于叫嚷“纵使国军退至长江以南，也还有半壁河山”的敌军高级将领赵崇武，姜部长也完全放弃了革命的原则，首先从政治上迎合吹捧，企图使他回心转意，接着又从感情上徇私叙旧，妄想使他“大彻大悟”。毛主席说，对于敌军的顽固派，只有通过斗争，才能使他们“顽”而不“固”，影片中的所谓政治争取，却没有一点斗争的火药味，有的只是感化的人情味。把一场瓦解敌军的艰巨的斗争，缩小为仅仅争取一小撮上层人物；在争取这些上层人物里，又抽去斗争的内容，偷换上媚态十足的吹捧和低声下气的乞求，这是影片又一严重的错误。
    毛主席在这篇文章里教导我们，用和平方式解决了敌人，“决不可以认为反革命力量顺从我们了，他们就成了革命党了，他们的反革命思想和反革命企图就不存在了。决不是这样。”影片却与毛主席的教导大唱反调。赵崇武、郑汉臣在还没有顺从我们以前，已经是有着北伐和抗战的“光荣历史”，有着爱护士兵、体贴百姓的“善良心肠”的“好人”，顺从我们以后，反革命的思想和反革命的企图更是一扫而光，变成了枪口对着蒋介石的亲信胡高参，嘴里喊着“反对你们制造内战，反对你们把中国卖给美国人”的革命英雄。为什么郑汉臣被俘以后，姜部长对他一开始就那么和颜悦色、低声下气，为他的“光荣历史”作鉴定，对他的顽固态度不加斗争就轻易释放回去？就在于他的头脑里根本没有敌情观念，对敌人寄托着无限的幻想。为什么他敢于冒险进城去见郑汉臣？就在于他相信自己的“不杀之恩”，郑汉臣一定会“感恩报德”，敌人有着“善良的人性”。篡改敌人反革命的历史，抹煞他们反革命的本质，影片在歌颂谁，反对谁这个“革命的首要问题”上，完全站在敌人那一边。
    毛主席关于革命战争的理论是对中国人民革命战争的伟大历史总结，是对马克思列宁主义的创造性的发展。毛主席反复教导我们：“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”历史的进程完全证明了毛主席的光辉论断。影片《兵临城下》却离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之经，叛人民战争之道，竭力美化敌人，宣扬敌人不打自倒，以取消武装斗争。这是反动的“离经叛道”论的艺术标本，这是宣扬修正主义的毒草，我们必须彻底铲除。
