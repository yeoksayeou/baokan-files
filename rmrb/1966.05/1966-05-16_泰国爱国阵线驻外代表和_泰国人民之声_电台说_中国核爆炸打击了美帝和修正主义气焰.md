    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th -- Paron Churanand, overseas representative of the Thailand Patriotic Front, wrote to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee on the 14th, saying that China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials "is not only a new great achievement made by the Chinese people in strengthening national defense and safeguarding the security of the motherland, but also a move against the nuclear blackmail of US imperialism and against the nuclear monopoly of US imperialism and the Khrushchev revisionists who attempt to undermine the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations. The Chinese people's nuclear weapons give great encouragement to the people of all countries who are engaged in heroic struggles for liberation and at the same time make a new contribution to safeguarding world peace." The letter said that China's achievement has made all peace-loving people in the world who are opposing imperialism and its accomplices rejoice.
    Paron Churanand's letter stated that the Thai people, like all peace-loving people in the world, resolutely support China's position: conducting necessary and limited nuclear tests and developing nuclear weapons in order to oppose the nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats of US imperialism, and to oppose the US-Soviet collusion to implement nuclear monopoly and undermine the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 14th -- Bangkok News: The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station broadcast a commentary on the 12th, warmly hailing China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials.
    The commentary said that the successful nuclear explosion is another great victory for the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, and is also another serious blow to the arrogance of US imperialism and its running dogs, the modern revisionists, who vainly attempt to threaten the people of the world with nuclear weapons.
    The commentary said that the successful nuclear explosion brought pleasure and excitement to the people and panic to the enemy.
    The commentary said that the Thai people are extremely happy and proud of China's successful nuclear explosion, and they regard this victory of the Chinese people as their own victory. China's strength gives the Thai people great encouragement in their struggle against US imperialism and the Thai ruling clique.
    The commentary further pointed out that nuclear weapons in the hands of imperialism, like all other weapons, are paper tigers. The decisive factor for the victory of the revolutionary struggles of oppressed peoples and oppressed nations is the people and their tenacious fighting spirit. As long as the people of all countries unite closely and wage a powerful struggle against US imperialism and its running dogs, the revolution of the people of the world will surely win final victory.

    泰国爱国阵线驻外代表和“泰国人民之声”电台说
    中国核爆炸打击了美帝和修正主义气焰
    新华社十五日讯　泰国爱国阵线驻外代表帕荣·朱拉暖十四日写信给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会说，中国成功地进行含有热核材料的核爆炸“不仅是中国人民在加强国防力量、保卫祖国安全方面所取得的新的伟大成就，而且是为了反对美帝国主义的核讹诈和反对美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者企图破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争的核垄断。中国人民的核武器，给予正在为解放而进行英勇斗争的各国人民以巨大鼓舞，同时对保卫世界和平作出了新的贡献。”信中说，中国的这一成就使正在反对帝国主义及其同谋者的全世界各国爱好和平人民欢欣鼓舞。
    帕荣·朱拉暖的信中说，泰国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的各国人民一样，坚决支持中国的立场：进行必要而有限制的核试验，发展核武器，是为了反对美帝国主义的核讹诈和核威胁，是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断、破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。
    据新华社十四日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十二日发表评论，热烈欢呼中国成功地进行含有热核材料的核爆炸。
    评论说，这次核爆炸成功，是中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的又一次伟大的胜利，也是对妄想以核武器来威胁全世界人民的美帝国主义及其走狗、现代修正主义者的嚣张气焰的又一次严重打击。
    评论说，这次核爆炸成功给人民带来了愉快和兴奋，给敌人带来了恐慌。
    评论说，泰国人民对中国这次核爆炸成功感到无比高兴和自豪，他们把中国人民这个胜利看作是自己的胜利。中国的强大给予泰国人民反对美帝国主义和泰国统治集团的斗争以巨大的鼓舞。
    评论进一步指出，掌握在帝国主义手里的核武器同其它一切武器一样，都是纸老虎。被压迫人民和被压迫民族革命斗争胜利的决定因素是人民和他们的顽强斗争精神。只要各国人民紧密团结起来同美帝国主义及其走狗进行强有力的斗争，世界人民的革命就一定能够获得最后胜利。
