    Lackeys and Lackeys' Lackeys
    Harbin Garment Factory Worker Zhang Baoju
    In "Evening Talks at Yanshan," Deng Tuo called on people to learn from Zheng Banqiao's character of "being one's own master, not a lackey" and to "blaze one's own trail." This is extremely malicious black talk!
    In the old society, our vast working people were enslaved and oppressed, and had no political standing. But in socialist society, our vast working people are the masters of society and the masters of the country. So, what does Deng Tuo mean by asking us to "be our own masters"?
    In fact, Deng Tuo has ulterior motives. He speaks sweetly, but in reality, he wants us not to listen to the Party, not to follow Chairman Mao, but to engage in individualism and "transform" our social system according to their will, and follow them down the capitalist road of darkness. How sinister and vicious this is!
    We know that when the working people become masters, it does not mean that they should not listen to the Party. On the contrary, we can better be masters only by listening to the Party. Only the Party and Chairman Mao can represent our greatest interests. If we do not listen to the Party and do not listen to Chairman Mao, wouldn't that be taking the road of regression, being enslaved and oppressed as in the old society?
    We sternly warn Deng Tuo: It is not us who are the lackeys, but people like Deng Tuo! You are not ordinary lackeys, but lackeys' lackeys. Why do we say this? Because you are the lackeys of the Khrushchev revisionists! The lackeys of the right opportunists! The lackeys of the feudal ruling class's henchmen! You are their most loyal lackeys, their echoers, speaking with one voice. And the Khrushchev revisionists, the right opportunists, and the henchmen of the feudal ruling class are all lackeys of the reactionary ruling class, all serving capitalism and feudalism.
    Isn't the fact obvious?
    Khrushchev scolded Stalin for engaging in "cult of personality" and "personal worship." Deng Tuo? Calling on us to "be our own masters, not lackeys," also wants us to vehemently oppose the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao like Khrushchev's great opposition to Stalin. Isn't this just an old trick played by a lackey under Khrushchev's baton!
    The right opportunists echoed Khrushchev, cursing our Great Leap Forward as having "collapsed" and "failed." And Deng Tuo? Like a parrot, he followed suit, saying that the Great Leap Forward was "talking big," "bragging," "rising false fire," and "running a high fever." He described our Party as "forgetful" and wanted our Party to step down and "rest." Isn't this the tone of a lackey of the right opportunists!
    Zheng Banqiao, Li Shan, and Li Sancai were all lackeys who served the feudal rulers. But Deng Tuo elevated these people to the heavens, wanting us to learn from these people. Isn't this a portrait of a lackey of the feudal ruling class's henchmen!
    In our country, the reactionary ruling class has been overthrown. However, their ghosts have not dispersed. Their lackeys, and even these lackeys' lackeys, want to summon their spirits, but it is in vain. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the proletarian cultural position from the hands of people like Deng Tuo, resolutely and thoroughly overthrow this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs, and overthrow these lackeys' lackeys!

    奴才和奴才的奴才
    哈尔滨服装厂工人　张宝驹
    邓拓在《燕山夜话》中，号召人们去学习郑板桥“自作主人，不作奴才”的性格，并要“自己踏出一条路来”。这是非常恶毒的黑话！
    在旧社会里，我们广大劳动人民受奴役，受压迫，在政治上没有地位。可是，在社会主义社会里，我们广大劳动人民，都是社会的主人，都是国家的主人。那么，邓拓还要我们去“自作主人”，这是什么意思呢？
    原来，邓拓是别有用心的。他说得很甜，实际上是要我们不去听党的话，不跟毛主席走；而去搞个人主义，按照他们的意志去“改造”我们的社会制度，跟他们去走资本主义的黑路。这是多么阴险和恶毒啊！
    我们知道，劳动人民做了主人，并不是就不去听党的话。正相反，我们听党的话，才能更好地做主人。只有党和毛主席才能代表我们的最大利益，我们不去听党的话，不去听毛主席的话，那不是要走回头路，象在旧社会一样受奴役和受压迫了么？
    我们正告邓拓：作奴才的不是我们，而是邓拓之流！你们不是一般的奴才，而是奴才的奴才。为什么这样说？因为，你们是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的奴才！是右倾机会主义者的奴才！是封建统治阶级爪牙的奴才！是他们最忠实的奴才，是他们的应声虫，同他们一个鼻孔出气。而赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，封建统治阶级的爪牙，统统都是反动统治阶级的奴才，统统是为资本主义、封建主义服务的。
    事实不是明摆着吗？
    赫鲁晓夫骂斯大林搞“个人迷信”、“个人崇拜”。邓拓呢？号召我们“自作主人，不作奴才”，也要我们象赫鲁晓夫大反斯大林那样去大反党中央和毛主席。这不是赫鲁晓夫指挥棒下的奴才耍的故技，又是什么！
    右倾机会主义分子同赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，咒骂我们的大跃进“垮台了”、“失败了”。而邓拓呢？鹦鹉学舌似地跟着说，大跃进是“说大话”、“吹牛皮”、“升虚火”、“发高烧”。他把我们党说成是“健忘病者”，要我们党下台“休息”。这不是右倾机会主义者的奴才的腔调，又是什么！
    郑板桥、李鱓、李三才，都是些为封建统治者效劳的奴才。可是邓拓把这些人抬到天上去，要我们向这些人学习。这不是封建统治阶级爪牙的奴才的画象，又是什么！
    在我国，反动统治阶级已经被推翻了。然而，他们的阴魂不散。他们的奴才，还有这些奴才的奴才，想为他们招魂，那也是徒然的。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化阵地从邓拓之流手中夺过来，坚决彻底打倒这一小撮反党反社会主义的黑帮，打倒这些奴才的奴才！
