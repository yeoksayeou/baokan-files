    According to a Hanoi dispatch from Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam fiercely attacked a U.S. Marine Corps artillery position located ten kilometers west of the Da Nang U.S. military base from late night on April 17th to the early morning of April 18th, eliminating more than one hundred U.S. aggressors.
    The heroic Liberation Army soldiers cleverly crossed the enemy's defenses, quietly infiltrated the artillery position, launched a surprise attack on the U.S. bandits, immediately eliminating the enemies in the position, destroying five 105mm howitzers and four heavy machine guns, demolishing five bunkers and twelve U.S. military dormitories, and burning down a gasoline depot and two military trucks.
    At the same time, another Liberation Army unit also attacked a U.S. military command post, eliminating many enemies and destroying one military truck.
    On the morning of April 18th, two U.S. M-118 armored vehicles rushed to the rescue, but they ran into a guerrilla minefield one kilometer away from the artillery position. One of the vehicles was destroyed, and all the U.S. soldiers on board were killed.
    According to another report, on the night of April 19th, the local forces of Tam Ky District in Quang Nam Province also attacked enemy troops stationed in Tu Son, eliminating more than forty enemies and destroying one M-113 amphibious armored vehicle.
    According to a Xinhua dispatch from Saigon on the 4th: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces skillfully ambushed two companies of U.S. Marines near An Hoa, about forty kilometers southwest of Da Nang, on the 3rd, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.
    According to Western news agencies, the two Marine companies were traveling in amphibious personnel carriers towards An Hoa that day, attempting to conduct a "sweep" of the area. However, the Liberation Armed Forces had already ambushed them on the banks of a river they had to cross. When the enemy's troop carriers reached the center of the river, they suddenly opened fire with a "storm" of mortar and automatic weapons. The enemy vehicles scrambled to shore, and the terrified U.S. soldiers desperately crawled out of the vehicles and ran for their lives into the nearby woods, trying to escape the Liberation Army's bullets. But they did not expect that another Liberation Army unit had already ambushed them there, and these U.S. aggressors were given another severe beating.
    On the night of the 3rd, the Liberation Armed Forces also dealt a heavy blow to another U.S. Marine Corps unit in Xuan Ngoc village nearby. This enemy force broke into Xuan Ngoc village and was suddenly met with heavy fire from the Liberation Armed Forces, forcing them to retreat. They sent a radio message for help, but the Liberation Armed Forces' ground fire was so intense that the helicopters carrying reinforcements could not land.
    Western news agencies also reported that the Liberation Armed Forces also ambushed a patrol of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division twenty-five kilometers west of Saigon in the early morning of the 3rd, inflicting "heavy casualties" on the enemy force.

    伏击运动之敌　突袭驻守之敌
    南越解放军在岘港附近痛歼美国海军陆战队
    据新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省解放武装力量，在四月十七日深夜到十八日凌晨，猛烈袭击位于岘港美军基地西面十公里的美国海军陆战队炮兵阵地，消灭美国侵略军一百多名。
    英勇的解放军战士们，机智地越过敌人的防线，悄悄插入炮兵阵地，对美国强盗发动突然袭击，立即消灭了阵地上的敌人，并击毁一○五毫米大炮五门和重机枪四挺，摧毁五座地堡和十二幢美军宿舍，烧毁一个汽油库和两辆军用卡车。
    与此同时，另一支解放军还袭击了美军的一个指挥所，消灭许多敌人，并击毁军用卡车一辆。
    十八日上午，美军两辆M—118型装甲车赶来救援，在距离炮兵阵地还有一公里的地方中了游击队的地雷阵，其中一辆被炸毁，车上的美军全部丧命。
    另据报道，四月十九日夜间，广南省三岐县地方部队又袭击了驻扎在土山的敌军，消灭敌人四十多名，击毁M—113型两栖装甲车一辆。
    据新华社四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量三日在岘港西南约四十公里的安和附近，巧妙地伏击了两连美国海军陆战队，使敌人遭到重大伤亡。
    据西方通讯社报道，当天，这两连海军陆战队乘水陆两栖运兵车向安和开去，企图对那个地区进行“扫荡”。但是，解放武装力量早已埋伏在他们必经的一条河的岸边，等敌军的运兵车开到河中心时，突然用“暴风雨般”的迫击炮和自动武器的火力进行猛烈射击。敌车慌忙靠岸，丧魂失魄的美国兵争先恐后地从车子里爬出来，没命地朝旁边的小树林跑去，想逃脱解放军的枪弹。但他们却没有料到，另一支解放军早已埋伏在那里，这些美国侵略军又挨了一顿狠揍。
    三日夜晚，解放武装力量还在附近的宣玉村给了另一支美国海军陆战队部队以沉重的打击。这支敌军闯进了宣玉村，突然遭到解放武装力量的猛烈射击，被迫后撤。他们发出无线电报求救，但解放武装力量的地面火力十分猛烈，敌人装运援军的直升飞机无法着陆。
    西方通讯社还报道，解放武装力量三日清晨还在西贡西面二十五公里处伏击了美国第二十五步兵师的一支巡逻队，使这支敌军遭到“惨重伤亡”。
