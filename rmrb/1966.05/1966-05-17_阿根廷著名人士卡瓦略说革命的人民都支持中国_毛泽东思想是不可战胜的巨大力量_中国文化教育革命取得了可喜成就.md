    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 15th. Argentinian renowned ophthalmologist Floreal Carballo, currently visiting Shanghai, told our reporter here that Mao Zedong Thought has become the guideline for the actions of the 700 million Chinese people, and from this, an immense force has been generated. This force is invincible to imperialism and modern revisionism. He said: This is a great encouragement to us.

    Carballo said that he has seen the Chinese people enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's works. To understand contemporary reality, one must first understand the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism. We must carefully study and absorb the theories and viewpoints put forward by Mao Zedong, because it is a guide for us to clearly recognize problems when U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism create chaos, a key to solving problems, and a weapon to promote the revolutionization of the masses.

    Carballo gave high praise to the achievements of China's medical and health undertakings today, which follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people." He said that China has applied materialist dialectics to medicine, thus breaking old frameworks and combining traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine. In this way, it has embarked on a new path, making new contributions in the field of medicine, and many aspects are new creations of world significance.

    When talking about China's education and culture, Carballo said that China is undergoing a profound revolution in these areas. He believes that China's half-work, half-study education system is a revolutionary system that can truly cultivate revolutionary successors and revolutionary proletarian intellectuals.

    He said that today China's literature and art are undergoing a profound revolution in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and have achieved gratifying success in this regard. The literary and artistic works seen in some countries such as the Soviet Union teach people to forget the revolution, essentially paralyzing the people and following bourgeois humanism.

    When talking about the revolutionary movements of the Latin American people, he condemned imperialism for suppressing the people's revolutionary movements through both violent and non-violent means. He also condemned the revisionists for standing on the side of imperialism and the financial oligarchy of various countries, implementing a policy of compromise, and vigorously advocating peaceful transition, pursuing the "peaceful great family" advocated by Johnson.

    He continued by saying that revolutionary people can only take the road of using revolutionary violence to overthrow counter-revolutionary violence, and there is no other way out.

    Carballo emphasized that imperialism and revisionism want to attack China and isolate China. But the revolutionary people support China, and it is imperialism and revisionism that are becoming increasingly isolated.

    He said: The deepening of the Chinese revolution and revolutionary steadfastness are enough to foretell that China's future is bright. (Attached Picture)

    阿根廷著名人士卡瓦略说革命的人民都支持中国
    毛泽东思想是不可战胜的巨大力量
    中国文化教育革命取得了可喜成就
    新华社上海十五日电　正在上海访问的阿根廷著名眼科专家弗洛雷阿尔·卡瓦略在这里对本社记者说，毛泽东思想已经成了七亿中国人民的行动准则，并由此产生了巨大的力量。这种力量是帝国主义和现代修正主义所不可战胜的。他说：这对我们是极大的鼓舞。
    卡瓦略说，他看到中国人民正在热情地学习毛主席著作。要了解当代现实，首先要了解马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我们要很好地学习和吸取毛泽东所提出来的理论和观点，因为它是美帝国主义、现代修正主义制造混乱时引导我们清楚地认识问题的指南，是解决问题的钥匙和促进群众革命化的武器。
    卡瓦略对今天中国医疗卫生事业遵循毛主席“为人民服务”的教导所取得的成就给予高度的评价。他说，中国已经把唯物辩证法运用到医学中去，因此打破了旧框框，中西医结合了起来，这样就走出了新的道路，从而在医学这个领域内作出了新的贡献，许多方面都是具有世界意义的新创造。
    卡瓦略在谈到中国的教育和文化时说，中国在这些方面正在进行一场深刻的革命。他认为，中国的半工半读教育制度是一种能够真正培养出革命的后代、培养出革命无产阶级知识分子的革命制度。
    他说，今天中国的文艺正在按毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》一文所指出的方向进行深刻的革命，并且在这方面取得了可喜的成就，而人们在苏联等一些国家所看到的文艺作品，是教人们忘记革命，实质上是麻痹人民，遵循资产阶级的人道主义。
    在谈到拉丁美洲人民革命运动的时候，他谴责帝国主义通过暴力和非暴力的两手来镇压人民的革命运动。他还谴责修正主义者站在帝国主义和各国财政寡头势力一边，实行妥协政策，大力鼓吹和平过渡，追求象约翰逊所鼓吹的“和平大家庭”。
    他接着说，革命的人民只能采取用革命暴力去打倒反革命的暴力，其他别无出路。
    卡瓦略强调说，帝国主义和修正主义想攻击中国、孤立中国。但革命的人民是支持中国的，日益遭到孤立的恰恰是帝国主义和修正主义。
    他说：中国革命的深化和革命坚定性，足以预言中国的前途是美好的。（附图片）
