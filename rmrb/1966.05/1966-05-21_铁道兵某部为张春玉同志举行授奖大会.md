    Calling on Railway Corps commanders and fighters to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to compete with the enemy in various forms of class struggle, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.
    Comrade Zhang Chunyu expressed that he would study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, resolutely act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, recuperate from injuries for the revolution, train for the revolution, strive to return to work as soon as possible, and struggle for the cause of communism for the rest of his life.
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th. According to the order of the leading organs of the Railway Corps to award Comrade Zhang Chunyu, a hard-boned fighter who wholeheartedly serves the public, a first-class merit, a certain unit of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army solemnly held an award ceremony on the 16th.
    Participating in this award ceremony were responsible persons from the Railway Corps and local Party and government organs, as well as representatives from the Railway Corps units and local residents.
    He Huiyan, Chief of Staff of the Railway Corps, read out the order of the leading organs of the Railway Corps at the meeting. The order pointed out that Zhang Chunyu, deputy squad leader and Communist Party member of the 16th Company of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, on the early morning of June 30, 1965, in an accidental cave-in during tunnel construction, was not afraid of danger and stepped forward bravely. Together with three other comrades, he bravely rescued the injured comrades and was trapped by a collapsed boulder for two hours and forty minutes. He was seriously injured, but he always kept the revolution in mind and his comrades in mind. He demonstrated the noble qualities and proletarian hard-boned spirit of a revolutionary fighter and Communist Party member armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who "cares more about the Party and the masses than about himself, and cares more about others than about himself." For this, Comrade Zhang Chunyu is awarded a first-class merit.
    Then, Xi Huating, political commissar of the unit where Zhang Chunyu was located, introduced Comrade Zhang Chunyu's deeds at the meeting. He said that since joining the army, Zhang Chunyu has consistently studied Chairman Mao's books diligently, read through Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and written more than 160,000 words of diaries and study notes. He did what Chairman Mao said, always putting others before himself, being selfless, enduring hardships first, enjoying comforts later, and going wherever it was most difficult. In times of crisis, he bravely stepped forward and sacrificed himself to save others. In the hospital, he fought tenaciously against pain with revolutionary spirit, actively organizing everyone to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and making the political atmosphere in the ward very strong. During his long-term bed rest, he always worked wholeheartedly for the public and for the Party, warmly caring for comrades, and never considering himself.
    Cui Tianmin, second political commissar of the Railway Corps, pointed out in his speech that Zhang Chunyu is a Lei Feng-style proletarian hard-boned fighter and a prominent representative of the tens of thousands of good people and good deeds in the Railway Corps. He called on the commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps to seriously learn from Zhang Chunyu, to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like him, to work hard to transform their subjective world, to overcome all selfish and impure thoughts centered on "self," and to truly establish the idea of not seeking fame, not seeking profit, not fearing war, not fearing sacrifice, and wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world, to take pride in labor, to take pride in hardship, to "report first to difficult places," to "report first to supporting the world revolution," to "willingly build roads for the people for a lifetime," to "be willing to endure hardships that others have not endured," and to "dedicate one's life to the infinitely beautiful cause of communism." Cui Tianmin called on everyone to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to further implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's five principles of highlighting politics, to always keep in mind the important affairs of the Party and the country, to not forget class struggle, and to dare to compete with the enemy in various forms of class struggle. In the current Great Cultural Revolution, we must, together with the workers, peasants, and masses of the whole country, actively participate in the struggle, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.
    Zhang Chunyu spoke in warm applause.
    He said excitedly: I have only done what a revolutionary fighter and Communist Party member should do, but the Party and the people have given me such lofty honor. In the future, I must study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, resolutely act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, recuperate from injuries for the revolution, train for the revolution, strive to return to work as soon as possible, build roads for the people, and struggle for the cause of communism for the rest of my life.

    号召铁道兵指战员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢于在各种形式的阶级斗争中和敌人较量，坚决彻底搞掉反党反社会主义黑线
    张春玉同志表示要更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，为革命养伤，为革命锻炼，争取早日重返工作岗位，为共产主义事业奋斗终生
    新华社二十日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵某部根据铁道兵领导机关授予一心为公的硬骨头战士张春玉同志以一等功奖励的命令，十六日隆重举行授奖大会。
    参加这次授奖大会的，有铁道兵和当地党政机关负责人，以及铁道兵部队和当地居民的代表。
    铁道兵参谋长何辉燕在会上宣读了铁道兵领导机关的命令。命令指出，铁道兵某部十六连副班长、共产党员张春玉同志，一九六五年六月三十日凌晨，在一次隧道施工的意外塌方中，临危不惧挺身而出，和另外三个同志一起奋勇抢救受伤战友，被一块下塌巨石的凹陷处卡住两小时四十分钟之久。他身负重伤，始终念念不忘革命，念念不忘战友，表现了一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士、共产党员“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重”的高尚品质和无产阶级的硬骨头精神。为此，特给予张春玉同志立一等功奖励。
    接着，张春玉所在部队的政治委员席华亭，在会上介绍了张春玉同志的事迹。他说，张春玉入伍以来，一贯勤奋读毛主席的书，通读了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，写了十六万多字的日记和心得笔记。毛主席怎样说，他就怎样做，处处先人后己，公而忘私，吃苦在前，享受在后，那里最艰苦，他就在那里；在危急时刻，他奋不顾身，舍己救人；在医院里，以革命精神顽强地和伤痛作斗争，积极组织大家活学活用毛主席著作，把病室的政治空气搞得浓浓的。他在长期卧床养伤中，始终一心为公、一心为党工作，热忱地关怀同志，唯独不考虑自己。
    铁道兵第二政治委员崔田民在讲话中指出，张春玉是雷锋式的无产阶级硬骨头战士，是铁道兵部队成千成万好人好事突出的代表。他号召铁道兵指战员认真学习张春玉，要象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，在改造主观世界上狠下功夫，克服以“我”字为中心的各种私心杂念，真正地树立不为名，不为利，不怕战争，不怕牺牲，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的思想，以劳动为荣，以艰苦为荣，“对于艰苦的地方报第一名”，“支援世界革命报第一名”，“甘愿为人民修一辈子路”，“乐意吃别人没有吃过的苦”，“把一生献给无限美好的共产主义事业”。崔田民号召大家更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步落实林彪副主席突出政治的五项原则，头脑里时刻想着党的大事，国家的大事，不忘阶级斗争，敢于在各种形式的阶级斗争中和敌人较量。在当前的文化大革命中，要和全国工农群众一起，积极参加斗争，捍卫毛泽东思想，坚决彻底搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线。
    张春玉在热烈的掌声中讲话。
    他激动地说：我只是做了一个革命战士、共产党员应该做的事情，党和人民却给了我这样崇高的荣誉。今后，我一定要更加刻苦地学习毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，为革命养伤，为革命锻炼，争取早日重返工作岗位，为人民修路，为共产主义事业奋斗终生。（附图片）
