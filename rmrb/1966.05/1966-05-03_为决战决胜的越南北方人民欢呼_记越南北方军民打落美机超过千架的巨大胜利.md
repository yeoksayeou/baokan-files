    Cheers for the Decisive Victory of the Northern Vietnamese People
     ——On the Great Victory of the Northern Vietnamese Army and People in Shooting Down Over a Thousand American Planes
    Recently, the total number of American planes shot down by the army and people of North Vietnam has exceeded one thousand. This is a great victory. This victory will greatly enhance the fighting spirit of the Vietnamese people in their resistance against America and for national salvation, and greatly encourage the confidence of people all over the world in the anti-American struggle.
    We walk on the land of Vietnam, chat with soldiers and militiamen, and watch from the front lines as American planes are hit and fall. We cross rivers, pass through rice paddies and villages, and visit factories and mines. What the people of this heroic land tell us with their actions and bold words, what is presented before our eyes, is the fact that they are constantly striking at the American air pirates.
    Now one thousand and five American planes have been buried here. This number is more than three hundred more than the total number of approximately seven hundred aircraft currently possessed by the US Seventh Fleet. It is more than double the four hundred and thirty-seven enemy planes shot down and destroyed by the Vietnamese people during the entire anti-French war. People can see that the people of North Vietnam have torn the "prestige" of American imperialism to pieces on the land of Vietnam.
        The Fundamental Factors of Victory
    Having traveled through many places in this land, I deeply understand that the most fundamental factor in North Vietnam's achievement of such a glorious victory lies in the people who have risen up to fight for resistance against America and for national salvation.
    The soldiers on Hon Go Island, located at the forefront of the North, have had their heroic deeds spread throughout the country. They shot down dozens of enemy planes on this small island, resisting the enemy's round-the-clock attacks. Here, many soldiers are not afraid of hardship, and some persist in fighting with injuries. Hatred for the enemy and love for the motherland enable them to find various methods to fight the enemy under all conditions. A gunner named Zhao hit an enemy plane with visual observation even when his observation device was broken. Soldier Comrade De, in order to remove a time bomb on the position, embraced the bomb himself because it was difficult to move it, and asked his comrades to disassemble it from above. Soldier Comrade E suffered serious injuries, with nine holes pierced in his intestines and a rib broken. At that time, the position lacked anesthesia, so he asked the doctor to operate on him without medication or blindfolding, and he did not make a sound during the major surgery. He wanted to win a victory in treatment as well, striving for an early recovery and returning to the battle position.
    Such soldiers, no matter what kind of modern enemy aircraft or what kind of danger, cannot frighten them. Instead, they use their wisdom to shatter the enemy's various tricks. A few days ago, comrades from the Mei Island troops talked to me about how the soldiers and civilians on this small island fought fiercely against American thieves in planes and warships. They had learned all kinds of tricks used by the enemy planes, and they accurately targeted the enemy's weaknesses. They remained calm and fearless in the face of the enemy's attacks. Once, when enemy planes were circling at a high altitude, they continued to train as usual. They said that the enemy planes were too high, saving them the trouble of wasting time, and they would just do their own thing. Perhaps the American bandits in the sky were puzzled. On the seventh attempt, the American planes tried to dive down, and the light and heavy weapons on the ground fired together, shooting down an American plane on the spot, which fell into the sea. The other enemy planes quickly fled to high altitude, and the soldiers began training again below.
    Only by understanding the spirit of the army and people of North Vietnam in their determination to fight to the end can one understand how the army and people of North Vietnam used light weapons such as rifles to shoot down a large number of modern American aircraft. In a county with many bridges and a key transportation hub, the army and people enthusiastically used rifles and light machine guns to shoot down enemy planes, becoming the most outstanding place in the province. A comrade in charge of the county's armed work said: "We fight head-on against the diving enemy planes, and think of various ways to fight. Our militiamen are getting more and more enthusiastic in this way." He said that in some places, the militiamen set up fake vehicles and fake positions on the ground, and when the enemy planes were fooled and dived down to bomb, the light weapons fired up and destroyed or damaged the enemy planes. A comrade named Zu was simply obsessed with shooting down enemy planes. He often carried a heavy machine gun and a small rice pot, and held his ground on the position to shoot down enemy planes. This young man from a hired worker's family was also an instructor for militiamen in the area on using light weapons to shoot down enemy planes.
    Do we need more examples? As long as you listen to the heartfelt words of the workers, peasants, youth, and women of North Vietnam, you will know that no aggressor can fail in the face of them. How much blood feud was created by imperialism, which aroused a strong force among the Vietnamese people to resist the aggressors.
          Bombing has Tempered the People
    American imperialism sent its planes to bomb during the day and bomb at night, bombing factories, bridges, roads, schools, hospitals, and even residential areas and nurseries, carrying out war blackmail against the Vietnamese people, trying to frighten the Vietnamese people. However, American imperialism's calculations were wrong. The Vietnamese people were not frightened by American planes and bombs. They resolutely carried out the struggle against America and for national salvation, and resolutely marched forward on the road of defending the North, liberating the South, and then unifying the motherland.
    If you travel through some places in North Vietnam, you will deeply feel that American imperialism's aerial aggression cannot stop the people's footsteps, but has tempered the people and inspired the Vietnamese people to forge ahead bravely under difficult conditions. The agricultural output in many places is higher in the flames of war than before, and industry in many places is developing in a small and decentralized direction. In particular, the transportation lines, which American imperialism tried its best to stagnate and block, have broken through the enemy's bombing and strafing to ensure smooth flow. The transportation lines are the places where the Vietnamese army and people compete with the enemy planes the most and most frequently, and the victory on the transportation lines can also be clearly reflected in the shooting down of over a thousand American planes.
    Recently, we have traveled through several provinces, where the traffic flows like water, shuttling back and forth. The transportation lines are naturally also battle lines, and the air defense network along the transportation lines is undertaken by the broad masses. Wherever the enemy planes intrude, the army and people there will start fighting. Bridges, ferry crossings, mountain passes, etc., are all important places for the people to ensure transportation and fight against the enemy. In a township near a highway bridge, I saw the masses cherish the transportation lines as if they were their own eyes. The militiamen in this township often hold their positions beside the roads and bridges, waiting for the enemy planes to arrive. If there are time bombs beside the road, they will remove them themselves. In a large house in this township, there is a slogan posted: "If the enemy destroys, we will repair. If the enemy destroys again, we will repair again." They did indeed serve the transportation with such tenacity. Once the enemy bombed several large pits on the road surface at the bridgehead, they were the first to rush up to repair them. Later, with the support of other townships, vehicles were able to pass smoothly after a few hours.
    Near another ferry crossing, we saw a new road bypassing a large bomb crater through the village, which we did not see the last time we passed by here. The Vietnamese comrade in the car said: "As long as the transportation line needs it, the masses will dedicate their strength. This new road was built by this township in only three nights." Also near this ferry crossing, we heard many touching stories of the masses supporting the transportation lines. In one family, the father and three children participated in transferring goods when enemy planes bombed and strafed the transport ships. In the intense battle, the father sacrificed himself, and later the son was also injured. The daughter sent her brother to the medical facility, wiped away her tears, and devoted herself to the transportation with even greater vigor. The person who told the story forgot the name of this girl. However, the noble qualities and fighting will of her family of three, representing the masses supporting the transportation lines, are forever unforgettable.
    Also on this section of the road, enemy planes were constantly being shot down. The Vietnamese army and people are breaking the path of the enemy planes' rampage and opening up their own path to victory. They shot down one enemy plane after another, both those that committed atrocities and those that did not have time to bomb, and their own vehicles still sped across the land where the enemy planes fell, and the army and people came and went.
        This is Only a Preliminary Victory
    The record of one thousand and five aircraft shows the great achievement of the Vietnamese people's determination to win a complete victory. However, the Vietnamese army and people regard this as a beginning in the entire cause of defending the North, liberating the South, and then unifying the motherland. Chairman Ho Chi Minh said recently in his speech at the Third Session of the Third National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: "We have achieved brilliant victories, but this is only a preliminary victory." "Our Vietnamese nation is a heroic nation. We are determined to fight resolutely to the complete victory for true peace, independence, and freedom." Chairman Ho's words expressed the Vietnamese people's determination to carry the cause of resistance against America and for national salvation to the end.
    A Vietnamese comrade once pointed to the beautiful and rich mountains and rivers and said: "We are prepared for the enemy to come in larger numbers and more fiercely. Our land is enough to place a larger number of American plane wrecks and to serve as a graveyard for the invaders."
    One thousand and five is only a record of the American aggressors' failures in the North over the past year. The army and people of South Vietnam have shot down and destroyed 3,893 American aircraft from the beginning of 1961 to March 1966, of which 1,337 were in 1965 and 947 in the first three months of this year. If American imperialism dares to further expand its aggression against the North, then the anti-American competition between the people of North and South Vietnam will be even more lively, and the victory will be even greater.

    为决战决胜的越南北方人民欢呼
     ——记越南北方军民打落美机超过千架的巨大胜利
    最近，越南北方军民打落美机的总数已经超过一千架，这是一个大胜利。这个胜利将大大增强越南人民抗美救国的斗志，大大鼓舞全世界人民反美斗争的信心。
    我们在越南的土地上行走，和战士、民兵畅谈，在阵地上看着美机被打中坠下。我们渡过江河，经过稻田和村舍，访问工厂和矿山。这英雄土地上的人民用他们的行动和豪言壮语所告诉我们的，所展现在我们眼前的，就是他们不断打击美国空中强盗的事实。
    现在一千架零五美机已经葬身在这里了。这个数字比现在美国第七舰队拥有的七百架左右飞机的总数还要多三百架，等于越南人民在整个抗法战争期间击落击毁的敌机四百三十七架的两倍多。人们可以看到，越南北方人民把美帝国主义的“威风”一片片撕落在越南的土地上了。
        胜利的根本因素
    我在这土地上走过许多地方，深深体会到越南北方获得如此辉煌的胜利最根本的因素，就是那些为抗美救国奋起战斗的人们。
    昏果岛上的战士，处在北方最前沿，他们英勇战斗的事迹传遍全国。他们在这个小岛上击落了几十架敌机，抗击了敌人日夜轮番的进攻。这里有多少战士不怕艰苦，有的带着伤坚持战斗。对敌人的仇恨和对祖国的热爱，使他们寻找各种方法在各种条件下打敌人。一位叫照的炮手，在观测器坏了的情况下，用目测也打中了敌机。战士得同志为了清除阵地上的定时炸弹，在不好大移动炸弹的情况下，自己抱起炸弹，让战友从上面拆开。战士峨同志受了重伤，肠部穿了九个孔，肋骨打掉一节，当时阵地缺麻醉药，他就让医生不用药、不蒙眼开刀，一声不哼地让动完大手术。他要在治疗上也打个胜仗，争取早日痊愈，重新走上战斗岗位。
    这样的战士，什么样的现代化敌机，什么样的艰险也吓不倒他们。而他们却要发挥智慧，粉碎敌人的各种花招。前些天，湄岛的部队同志向我谈到这个小岛军民痛击美国飞贼和军舰的情形。敌机活动的各种花招，他们都领教过了，他们看准了敌人的弱点打，而在敌机进攻面前镇静无畏。有一次，敌机在高处盘旋，他们却照样在练兵。他们说，敌机太高，省得耽误工夫，我们干我们的事。也许美国强盗在天空纳闷，到了第七次，美机试着往下冲，地面的轻重武器火力齐上，当场打落一架美国飞机，掉入大海。别的敌机连忙逃向高空，战士们又在下面练起兵来。
    只有了解越南北方军民决战决胜的精神，才能了解越南北方军民怎样用步枪这类轻武器打落大量美国现代化飞机的事情。在一个桥梁多、处于交通要冲的县里，军民踊跃用步枪、轻机枪打敌机，成为全省最突出的地方。一个负责这个县武装工作的同志说：“迎着冲下来的敌机打，想出各种办法打，我们的民兵就这样越打越起劲。”他说，有的地方民兵在地面布置了假车辆、假阵地，等敌机上了当，冲下来炸，轻武器打上去就击毁击伤敌机。有一位卒同志，简直迷上了打敌机。他经常扛上重机枪，背个小饭锅，坚守在阵地上打敌机。这个雇工家庭出身的青年，还是一个地区民兵用轻武器打敌机的教练员。
    还需要更多的例子吗？只要听一听越南北方工人、农民、青年、妇女的心里话，就知道在他们面前一切侵略者都不能不失败。多少血海深仇是帝国主义制造成的，这在越南人民中激起了强大的抗击侵略者的力量。
          轰炸锻炼了人民
    美帝国主义派遣它的飞机，白天炸，黑夜炸，炸工厂、桥梁、道路、学校、医院以至居民区和托儿所，对越南人民进行战争讹诈，想吓倒越南人民。然而，美帝国主义的算盘是打错了。越南人民并没有被美国的飞机和炸弹吓倒。他们坚决地进行抗美救国的斗争，坚决地在保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国的大道上迈步前进。
    如果你在越南北方走过一些地方，就会深深感到美帝国主义的空中侵略并不能阻挡人民的脚步，而是锻炼了人民，激发越南人民在艰苦困难条件下奋勇前进。许多地方的农业产量在战火中比以前更高，许多地方工业向小型分散的方向发展。特别是美帝国主义极力想使之停滞阻塞的交通运输线，冲开敌人的轰炸扫射保证了畅通。交通运输线是越南军民同敌机较量最多最频繁的地方，交通运输线上的胜利从打落美国飞机超过一千架也可以鲜明地体现出来。
    最近，我们曾走过几个省，在那里的交通线上，车如流水，来往穿梭。交通线自然也是战斗线，沿交通线是由广大群众担负起的防空网。敌机侵扰到那里，那里的军民就展开战斗。桥梁、渡口、山口等等，都是人民保证交通运输与敌人进行斗争的要地。在一个靠近公路桥梁的乡里，我看见群众象爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护交通线。这个乡的民兵经常在路旁桥边坚守阵地，等待敌机到来。路旁有了定时炸弹，他们就自己去拆除。在这个乡的一间大屋子里贴着一条标语：“敌人一破坏，我们就修复，敌人再破坏，我们再修复。”他们也的确这样顽强地为保证交通运输服务。有一次敌人在桥头路面上炸了很大的几个坑，他们最先冲上去修，后来加上别乡支援，在几个小时后，车辆就畅通了。
    在另一个渡口附近，我们看到一条绕开大弹坑的新路穿过村边，而这是我们上次路过这里时还没有的。同车的越南同志说：“只要运输线需要，群众就献出力量。这条新路，这个乡只用三个夜晚修起来的。”也在这个渡口附近，我们听了许多群众支援交通运输线的动人的事例。有一家父亲和儿女三人一起在敌机轰炸扫射运输船只时参加转运货物，在紧张的战斗中，父亲牺牲了，后来儿子也受了伤，女儿就把自己哥哥送到医疗的地方，回来她擦擦眼泪又以更大的干劲投入运输的行列。讲这件事情的人忘记了这位姑娘的名字。但是，她的一家三人所代表的群众支援交通运输线的高尚品质和斗争意志，是永远令人难忘的。
    也就在这一段路上，敌机不断被打落。越南军民正是打断了敌机横行的路，开辟着自己通往胜利的路。他们把行凶的敌机和来不及轰炸的敌机，一架又一架打落，在敌机坠落的土地上照样奔驰着自己的车辆，走过来往的军民。
        这只是初步的胜利
    一千零五架的纪录显示了越南人民必将完全胜利的决战决胜的伟大成果。但是，越南军民把这看作在保卫北方，解放南方，进而统一祖国的整个事业中的一个开头。胡志明主席最近在越南民主共和国第三届国会第三次会议上的讲话中说：“我们已经取得辉煌的胜利，但这仅仅是初步的胜利”，“我们越南民族是一个英雄的民族，我们决心为争取真正的和平、独立和自由而坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”胡主席的话表达了越南人民把抗美救国事业进行到底的决心。
    有一位越南同志曾指着秀丽而富饶的山河说：“我们准备敌人更大批更凶地来。我们的土地足够放置更大量的美机残骸和用作侵略者的坟场。”
    一千零五架只不过是一年多来美国侵略者在北方失败的纪录。越南南方军民从一九六一年初至一九六六年三月已经击落击毁美国飞机三千八百九十三架，其中一九六五年占一千三百三十七架，今年头三个月占九百四十七架。如果美帝国主义再敢扩大对北方的侵略，那么越南南北方人民的抗美竞赛就将更加热闹，胜利就将更大。
