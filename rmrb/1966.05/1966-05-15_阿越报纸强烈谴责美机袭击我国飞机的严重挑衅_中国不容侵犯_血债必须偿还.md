    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 14th, the Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published an editorial on the 14th, condemning the serious provocation of U.S. Air Force against Chinese aircraft in the airspace of the People's Republic of China.

    The article pointed out that the sudden attack on Chinese aircraft undergoing training flights was a serious provocative incident and a blatant violation of the airspace of the People's Republic of China by the U.S. imperialists. Hundreds of millions of people around the world, like the great Chinese people, expressed strong indignation. The Albanian people deeply understand the feelings of the fraternal Chinese people, share their hatred of the enemy, and strongly protest and condemn the U.S. imperialists for daring to take hostile actions against China with such impunity.

    The article pointed out that this serious provocation against China is another vivid example of the U.S. attempt to expand the war in Vietnam to Southeast Asia and the territory of the People's Republic of China.

    The article emphasized that developments are increasingly exposing the U.S. imperialists' aggressive conspiracies against People's China and the multifaceted preparations they are making to establish a "circle of encirclement" around China. In its anti-China campaign, the Johnson administration openly or secretly coordinates its hostile actions with the Soviet revisionist leading group, the Indian reactionaries, and Japanese militarism. All these enemies of the Chinese people have the same goal: to isolate China, undermine the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China, and denigrate China's peaceful policies and its great role in the world. They are targeting the People's Republic of China because the People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of the forces of freedom, resolutely fighting against imperialism and colonialism, and because the People's Republic of China opposes the plans of the U.S. and Soviet superpowers to dominate the world. People's China has become the true and most powerful bastion of the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause, the cause of freedom of all peoples, and the cause of world peace. Therefore, People's China has won the love and deep gratitude of all progressive people.

    *People's Voice* emphasized: Great People's China possesses all the necessary means to defend itself and give the enemy the response it deserves. The Chinese people have been tempered in the great fire of the People's Revolution, in the battle to build socialism, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Great People's China has sincere and loyal friends. The revolutionary people of all countries stand with China.

    The newspaper *Unity* said in an editorial on the same day entitled "American Robbers Go Too Far," "The honor and dignity of the Chinese people must not be violated under any circumstances. The Chinese people say that the blood debts owed by U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people must be repaid. The American robbers should seriously consider this warning. The People's Republic of China is untouchable, and the Chinese people will always be vigilant, and the heroic Chinese army is always ready to crush all enemies."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th, the Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* published a commentary on the 14th, severely condemning the blatant provocative act of U.S. imperialism in openly dispatching aircraft to intrude into the airspace of Yunnan Province, China, and attacking Chinese aircraft on the 12th.

    The commentary said that U.S. imperialism's adoption of an extremely reactionary and bellicose policy towards China clearly exposes it as the head of aggressive and bellicose imperialism.

    The commentary said that for several years, in the face of China's firm support and assistance to the Vietnamese people in their war against U.S. aggression, the U.S. ruling clique has become even more frantically threatening China. However, the Chinese people resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism. The Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its determination to oppose the sinister conspiracies of the United States and its lackeys, its determination to recover China's territory of Taiwan, and its determination to continue to help the Vietnamese people.

    The commentary said that the Vietnamese people stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people at all times in the battle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism. If U.S. imperialism continues to stubbornly invade Vietnam and continues to venture to infringe upon China, it will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.

    阿越报纸强烈谴责美机袭击我国飞机的严重挑衅
    中国不容侵犯　血债必须偿还
    据新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十四日发表编辑部文章，谴责美国空军对中华人民共和国领土上空的中国飞机的严重挑衅。
    文章指出，对正在进行训练飞行的中国飞机的突然袭击是严重的挑衅事件，是美帝国主义者对中华人民共和国领空的明目张胆的侵犯。全世界千百万人民也同伟大的中国人民一样表示强烈的愤慨。阿尔巴尼亚人民深深地理解兄弟的中国人民的心情，和他们同仇敌忾，并且强烈抗议和谴责美帝国主义竟然肆无忌惮地对中国采取敌对行动。
    文章指出，这次对中国的严重挑衅，是美国企图把在越南发动的战争扩大到东南亚和中华人民共和国领土的又一次活生生的例证。
    文章强调指出，事态发展越来越暴露了美帝国主义者对人民中国的侵略阴谋，以及他们为了在中国周围建立“包围圈”而进行的多方面的准备。约翰逊政府在反华运动中，公开或秘密地把自己的敌对行动同苏联修正主义领导集团、印度反动派和日本军国主义配合起来。中国人民所有的这些敌人有着同样的目的：孤立中国，破坏中华人民共和国的社会主义建设，诋毁中国的和平政策和在世界上的伟大作用。他们之所以把矛头指向中华人民共和国，那是因为中华人民共和国站在爱好自由的力量的前列，坚决同帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争，是因为中华人民共和国反对美苏两大国主宰世界的计划。人民中国已经成为社会主义事业、革命事业、各国人民的自由事业和世界和平事业的真正的和最强大的堡垒。因此人民中国得到了所有进步人民的爱戴和深深的感激。
    《人民之声报》强调指出：伟大的人民中国拥有一切必需的手段进行自卫，并给予敌人以应得的回击。中国人民在伟大的人民革命烈火中，在建设社会主义的战斗中，受到了以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的锻炼。伟大的人民中国有真挚和忠诚的朋友。世界各国的革命人民都站在中国一边。
    《团结报》同一天在题为《美国强盗走得太远了》的编辑部文章中说，“中国人民的荣誉和尊严无论如何也不容侵犯。中国人民说，美帝国主义欠下中国人民的血债是一定要偿还的。美国强盗应该好好考虑这一警告。中华人民共和国是碰不得的，中国人民永远保持警惕，英雄的中国军队随时准备粉碎一切敌人。”
    新华社河内十四日电　越南《人民报》十四日发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义十二日公然派遣飞机侵入中国云南省领空，袭击中国飞机的蛮横挑衅行动。
    评论说，美帝国主义对中国采取极端反动和好战的政策，清楚地暴露了它是侵略和好战的帝国主义的头子。
    评论说，几年来，在中国坚决支持和帮助越南人民进行反对美国侵略战争的立场面前，美国统治集团更加疯狂地威胁中国。但是，中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义。中国政府曾多次表示了自己反对美国及走狗的不可告人的阴谋的决心、收复中国领土台湾的决心和继续帮助越南人民。
    评论说，越南人民时刻同兄弟的中国人民并肩站在一起，进行反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的战斗。如果美帝国主义继续顽固地侵略越南，并继续冒险侵犯中国，它就必将遭到更加惨重的失败。
