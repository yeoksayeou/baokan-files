    Xinhua News Agency, May 28th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, at a press conference on the 27th, expressed his great appreciation for the Indonesian right-wing military regime's efforts to end Indonesia's confrontation with "Malaysia." He indicated that the United States would further provide "aid" to the Indonesian government to reward the Indonesian right-wing military regime for intensifying its policy of relying on imperialism.
    Rusk bluntly stated, "Of course, in resolving the dispute between Indonesia and Malaysia, no one would be happier than we (the United States) if these issues could be resolved. I suspect there may be some such things happening, and I wish them well."
    Rusk also nakedly said that the United States is "interested" in "aiding" the Indonesian right-wing military regime. He said that this regime "faces some very serious economic problems. It has huge debt problems. It has some inflation problems." Rusk hinted that the Indonesian right-wing military regime is "taking the initiative" in selling out national sovereignty to meet the conditions for U.S. "aid." He said, "In the coming weeks and months, it (referring to the Indonesian government) will discuss these issues with several governments and institutions."
    Referring to the situation in Indochina, Rusk, disregarding the Cambodian government's refutation, once again fabricated rumors and slandered that "Cambodia has been used by the Viet Cong, and I also believe by some North Vietnamese, to infiltrate South Vietnam," attempting to use this as a pretext for further U.S. aggression against Cambodia. Disregarding the fact that the United States and its running dogs are constantly carrying out armed invasions of Cambodia, he hypocritically claimed that the United States "fully supports Cambodia's neutrality and territorial integrity."
    Referring to the spring meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ministerial Council to be held in Brussels on June 6, Rusk emphasized that the United States should intensify its collusion with the Soviet revisionist group to further use the Soviet revisionist group as an accomplice in promoting U.S. aggression policies. He said that in addition to dealing with "important issues" such as France's withdrawal from the military organization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the Brussels meeting, the United States is also "prepared to seek solutions to some major outstanding issues between East and West." He said, "We now believe that it is important for Western Europe, the United States, and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to continue to seek solutions to issues that can ease tensions." "We will study these things quite carefully at the Brussels meeting to see if there is any initiative we in the West can take to do something in this regard." He said that the U.S. government is doing some things in this regard, such as the U.S. government is asking Congress to approve the U.S.-Soviet consular agreement and to pass legislation on "East-West trade."
    Rusk indicated that current U.S.-Soviet collusion is primarily focused on the situation in Vietnam. He emphasized that there is a tense atmosphere on the Vietnam issue, which is "serious and dangerous," and the Vietnam issue must be "resolved." He said that even if the Vietnam issue "has not been resolved," the United States also "hopes to be able to deal with some of the issues, whether in terms of disarmament, or in terms of direct relations between East and West."

    印尼右派军人政权投靠美国得到赞赏
    腊斯克竭力鼓励印尼右派加紧反共卖国
    公然要加紧利用苏联修正主义集团作为侵略帮凶
    新华社二十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克二十七日在记者招待会上对印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在谋求结束印度尼西亚对“马来西亚”的对抗表示十分赞赏。他表明，美国将进一步对印度尼西亚政府提供“援助”，以奖赏印度尼西亚右派军人政权加紧投靠帝国主义的政策。
    腊斯克露骨地说，“当然，在解决印度尼西亚和马来西亚的争议方面，如果这些问题能够解决的话，没有人会比我们
  （美国）更高兴了。据我猜测，可能会有某些这样的事情，我希望他们诸事顺利。”
    腊斯克还赤裸裸地说，美国对“援助”印度尼西亚右派军人政权“感兴趣”。他说，这个政权“面临着一些非常严重的经济问题。它有着巨大的债务问题。它有着一些通货膨胀问题”。腊斯克暗示印度尼西亚右派军人政权在出卖国家主权以满足美国“援助”条件方面“采取主动”。他说，“在今后几周和几个月中，它（指印度尼西亚政府）将同若干政府和机构讨论这些问题”。
    谈到印度支那局势，腊斯克不顾柬埔寨政府的驳斥，又一次造谣诬蔑“柬埔寨已被越共，而且我认为也被一些北越人，用来向南越进行渗透”。企图以此作为美国进一步侵略柬埔寨的借口。他不顾美国及其走狗不断武装侵犯柬埔寨的事实，虚伪地扬言美国“完全支持柬埔寨的中立和领土完整”。
    谈到六月六日将在布鲁塞尔举行的北大西洋集团部长理事会春季会议，腊斯克强调美国要加紧同苏联修正主义集团勾结，以进一步利用苏联修正主义集团作为推行美国侵略政策的帮凶。他说，美国在布鲁塞尔会议除了要处理象法国退出北大西洋公约组织的军事机构这样一些“重要问题”以外，还“准备设法谋求解决东西方之间某些悬而未决的大问题。”他说，“现在我们认为，对西欧、美国和北大西洋公约组织的成员说来，继续谋求解决一些能使紧张局势缓和些的问题，是重要的”。“我们将在布鲁塞尔会议上相当仔细地研究这些事情，看看我们西方是否可能采取什么主动行动在这方面做些事情”。他说，美国政府在这方面正做一些事情，例如美国政府正在要求国会批准美国同苏联的领事协定和通过关于“东西方贸易”的立法。
    腊斯克表明，当前美苏勾结首先着眼的是越南局势。他强调在越南问题上存在着紧张气氛，这种气氛是“严重的、危险的”，越南问题要“解决”。他说，即使越南问题“还没有解决”，美国也“希望能够处理其中某些问题，无论是裁军方面的，或者是东西方的直接关系方面的”。
