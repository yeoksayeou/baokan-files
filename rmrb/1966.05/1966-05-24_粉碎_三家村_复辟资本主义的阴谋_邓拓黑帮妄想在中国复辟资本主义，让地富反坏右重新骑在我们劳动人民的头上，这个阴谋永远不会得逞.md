    Smash the "Three-Family Village's" Conspiracy to Restore Capitalism
    The Deng Tuo Gang dreamt of restoring capitalism in China, letting landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists once again ride on the backs of our working people. This conspiracy will never succeed.
    Lin Xiuying, Representative of the National People's Congress, Female Worker of Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 4
    The "Three-Family Village," with Deng Tuo as the manager, is a black den against the Party and against socialism. Deng Tuo and this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements controlled "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," using them as their positions to attack the Party and attack socialism. After reading their anti-Party materials, I am extremely angry!
    This small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements aimed their spearhead at the Party headed by our great leader Chairman Mao, viciously attacking the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. They cried and complained for the right-leaning opportunists who had been completely rejected by the people, vainly hoping that our Party would implement a revisionist line, dreaming of turning red China into black China. They were truly mad!
    Deng Tuo viciously slandered the General Line and the Great Leap Forward as having "failed," saying that we "smashed our heads and bled." This is simply opening your eyes and talking nonsense! I am a textile worker, and judging from the great development of the textile industry in our Shaanxi Province, I deeply realize that without the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, there would be no such large-scale textile industry today. Before liberation, the entire Shaanxi had only three or four dilapidated small textile factories, which could only produce low-grade products. After liberation, more than a dozen new large-scale textile factories have been built, and the number of spindles and looms has increased more than tenfold. Deng Tuo also slandered that our socialist "property is finished," but this is just their dream! Our socialist construction is developing rapidly. For example, under the correct leadership of the Party, all the workers in our factory have worked hard and created a large amount of wealth for the country with selfless labor. In the past ten years, the profits turned over could build six textile factories of the same scale. As the saying goes, "A dog's mouth can't produce ivory!" Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are agents of the bourgeoisie. They wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, use their powers to oppose our Party, and of course can only say those black words against the Party and against socialism!
    In his black article "The Theory of Cherishing Labor Power," Deng Tuo attacked our Party for "not cherishing labor power," saying that historically even the feudal ruling class knew how to "cherish labor power." What is the purpose of this naked slander? They want to instigate our working people to rise up against the Party and sow discord between the working people and the Party. Obviously, Deng Tuo and his like have chosen the wrong target. We working people know from our own personal experience that the Party cherishes the working people the most and cares about the working people the most. Only the capitalists and landlords of the old society regarded us working people as beasts of burden. Under the Party's cordial care and training, I have done the work that a worker should do, and the Party's care and love for me is greater than that of my own parents. In 1962, I had an eye disease, and I was sent to a sanatorium for recuperation. In 1963, I was sent to Qingdao for recuperation again. Is this what Deng Tuo and his like said that our Party "does not cherish labor power"? Facts show that Deng Tuo and his like are completely talking nonsense, have ulterior motives, and are attacking the Party and attacking socialism.
    The loyal lackeys of the bourgeoisie, Deng Tuo and his like, gathered a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities in an all-round and rampant manner, vainly attempting to restore capitalism in China and let the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists ride on the backs of our working people again. This conspiracy will never succeed! We working people must resolutely fight them to the end, and we resolutely defend socialism! Victory will surely belong to us!

    粉碎“三家村”复辟资本主义的阴谋
    邓拓黑帮妄想在中国复辟资本主义，让地富反坏右重新骑在我们劳动人民的头上，这个阴谋永远不会得逞
    全国人民代表大会代表、西北国棉四厂女工  林秀英
    以邓拓为掌柜的“三家村”，是一个反党反社会主义的黑店。邓拓等这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，把持了《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》，作为他们向党进攻、向社会主义进攻的阵地。看了他们的反党材料，使我万分气愤！
    这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，把矛头对准以我们伟大领袖毛主席为首的党，恶毒地攻击总路线，攻击大跃进，攻击人民公社。为被人民所彻底唾弃了的右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，妄想要我们的党实行修正主义路线，梦想把红色的中国变成黑色的中国，真是猖狂到了极点！
    邓拓恶毒地诬蔑总路线、大跃进“失败了”，说我们“碰得头破血流”。这简直是睁着眼睛说瞎话！我是一个纺织工人，从我们陕西省纺织工业的大发展来看，我深深体会到，没有总路线、大跃进，就没有今天这样规模巨大的纺织工业。解放前，整个陕西只有三、四家破烂不堪的小纺织厂，只能生产低级产品。解放后，新建的大型纺织厂就有十多座，纱锭和布机增加了十几倍。邓拓还诬蔑我们社会主义的“家当完蛋了”，这也不过只是他们的梦想！我们的社会主义建设事业，正在一日千里地发展。比如，我们厂在党的正确领导下，全体职工奋发图强，以忘我的劳动，为国家创造了大量的财富，十年来，上交利润就可以建同等规模的纺织厂六座。俗话说得好：“狗嘴里吐不出象牙！”邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等反党反社会主义分子是资产阶级的代理人，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，利用职权反对我们的党，当然只能说出那些反党反社会主义的黑话！
    邓拓在他写的《爱护劳动力的学说》那篇黑文中，攻击我们党“不爱护劳动力”，说什么历史上封建统治阶级也知道“爱护劳动力”，这种赤裸裸的诬蔑的目的何在？他们是想煽动我们劳动人民起来反对党，挑拨劳动人民和党的关系。显然，邓拓之流找错了对象。我们劳动人民从自己切身的体会中，知道党是最爱护劳动人民的，最关心劳动人民的。只有旧社会的资本家、地主，才把我们劳动人民当牛当马。我在党的亲切关怀和培养下，做了一个工人应该做的工作，而党对我的关心爱护，胜过亲生父母。一九六二年，我眼睛有了病，就送我到疗养院去休养。一九六三年，又送我到青岛去休养。这难道就是邓拓之流所说的我们党“不爱护劳动力”吗？事实说明，邓拓之流完全是胡说八道，别有用心，攻击党，攻击社会主义。
    资产阶级的忠实奴才邓拓之流，纠集一小撮反党反社会主义分子，全面地猖狂地进行反党反社会主义活动，妄想在中国复辟资本主义，让地富反坏右重新骑在我们劳动人民的头上。这个阴谋永远不会得逞！我们劳动人民要坚决和他们斗争到底，我们坚决保卫社会主义！胜利一定属于我们！
