    The film "Stage Sisters" has a dark theme, a somber tone, and a decadent mood. It is a work that touts bourgeois individual struggle, distorts, and vilifies the image of the broad masses of laboring people. It portrays the laboring people as numb, dispirited, and devoid of any spirit of resistance.
    At the beginning, the work depicts the masses surrounding the "Yangchun Stage," each craning their necks, listening to Xing Yuehong sing, as if the laboring people are carefree and leisurely. When Zhu Chunhua is tied to a stone pillar by the Kuomintang and paraded as a warning, the masses merely stand there watching the spectacle. No one expresses anger at the brutality of the police; no one expresses sympathy for Chunhua's unjust beating; only the child bride Xiao Chunhua brings Zhu Chunhua a bowl of water.
    We know that the 1930s and 1940s were a period when national and class contradictions in our country were extremely acute and intense. At that time, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, unafraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, unafraid of difficulties and hardships, rose up to resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. Our people had a strong spirit of resistance and struggle, and would never allow the rulers to oppress and devastate them. The film portrays the masses as so submissive and numb. This is smearing the faces of the revolutionary people and is the greatest slander against the broad masses of laboring people!
    According to the film, Xing Yuehong seems to be from a laboring people background. However, the film does not depict Tang's coercion and enticement, and she inexplicably degenerates, becoming a parasite of the bourgeoisie, as if the fault lies entirely with Xing Yuehong herself. This is a distortion of the oppressed!
    Moreover, Zhu Chunhua, who comes from a child bride background, after entering the "Yangchun Stage" and living the life of an artist, the playwright does not allow her to maintain the excellent quality of the laboring people, which is their class resistance, but instead imposes on her a lot of pretentious, aloof, individual struggle, and fame-seeking rubbish. It greatly exaggerates how she relies on her beauty, talent, and ability, and on her individual resistance, to strive for the "human rights" of the bourgeoisie. In her, there is not a trace of class consciousness, but only rotten and extremely reactionary bourgeois theories of human nature and humanitarianism. This is also a great vilification of Zhu Chunhua, who comes from a laboring people background.
    In recent years, a small handful of bourgeois representatives in literary and art circles have stirred up a counter-current of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment. They have used literary and art forms to peddle a large number of works containing the poisonous juice of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. We, the working class, must study Chairman Mao's works well, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, resolutely destroy this black line of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment in literary and art circles, smash their javelins, and cut off their black hands. We vow to carry this Great Cultural Revolution through to the end, and we will never stop until complete victory!

### 丑化了劳动人民

    丑化了劳动人民
    北京金属结构厂工人　李虹
    影片《舞台姐妹》主题阴暗，调子低沉，情绪颓废，是一部标榜资产阶级个人奋斗、歪曲和丑化广大劳动人民形象的作品，它把劳动人民写得麻木不仁，灰溜溜的毫无一点反抗精神。
    一开场，作品描写了群众围在“阳春舞台”前面，个个伸着脖子，倾听邢月红唱戏，好象劳动人民无忧无虑、十分悠闲似的。当竺春花被国民党绑在石柱上示众时，群众只是呆呆地围在那里看热闹，对于警察的残暴没有一个人表示愤怒；对于春花无辜受打，没有一个人表示同情，只是童养媳小春花给竺春花端来了一碗水。
    我们知道，三十年代和四十年代，正是我国处在民族矛盾和阶级矛盾十分尖锐、激烈的时期。当时，全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，不怕流血牺牲，不怕艰难困苦，奋起抵抗日本帝国主义的侵略。我国人民是有着强烈的反抗性和斗争精神的，决不会任凭统治者压迫和摧残，影片把群众写得这么忍气吞声和麻木不仁，这是向富于革命精神的人民群众脸上抹黑，这是对广大劳动人民最大的污蔑！
    照影片所写，邢月红象是劳动人民出身。但影片没有描写唐经理对她的威逼利诱，就莫名其妙地让她堕落，作了资产阶级的寄生虫，好象罪过全在邢月红自己身上。这是对被压迫者的歪曲！
    还有，出身于童养媳的竺春花，一到“阳春舞台”，一过艺人生活之后，剧作者不是让她保持劳动人民富于阶级反抗的优秀品质，而是大量给她外加一些清高、孤傲、个人奋斗、成名成家的臭东西。大肆渲染她如何凭着自己的美貌、才干和能耐，凭着个人的反抗，极力去争取资产阶级的“人权”。在她身上，丝毫没有一点阶级觉悟，有的是腐朽透顶、极其反动的资产阶级的人性论和人道主义，这对劳动人民出身的竺春花也是一种极大的丑化。
    近几年来，文艺界一小撮资产阶级代表人物，掀起了一股反党反社会主义的逆流，他们通过文艺形式，大量贩卖含着资产阶级、修正主义毒汁的作品，我们工人阶级，一定要好好学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想当作武器，坚决毁掉文艺界这条反党反社会主义的黑线，把他们的投枪砸碎，把他们的黑手斩断，我们誓把这场文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
