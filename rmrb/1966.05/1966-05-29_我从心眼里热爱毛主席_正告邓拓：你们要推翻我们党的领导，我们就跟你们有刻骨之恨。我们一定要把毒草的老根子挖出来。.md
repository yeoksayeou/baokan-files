    I wholeheartedly love Chairman Mao
    A stern warning to Deng Tuo: If you want to overthrow the leadership of our Party, we will have an eternal hatred for you. We must dig out the old roots of the poisonous weeds.
    Speed ​​skater Wang Jinyu
    Deng Tuo, you small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, dare to shout arrogantly that our beloved Party should quickly step down to "rest," "say nothing, do nothing," and listen to your "guidance" in everything. Your goal is to overthrow the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. This conspiracy of yours will not only be rejected by the entire Chinese people, but also by all revolutionary people in the world. As a speed skater, I have participated in international speed skating competitions abroad eight times. I have personally felt how much all the revolutionary people in the world love our great leader Chairman Mao. Our Chinese athletes are the most welcomed and respected wherever they go. Wherever we go, we are surrounded by the masses who cheer "China—Mao Zedong, China—Mao Zedong!" This shows how high the prestige of our country, our great Party, and our great leader Chairman Mao is in the hearts of all revolutionary people in the world. In foreign countries, many people yearn for Beijing. When I went to Sweden to participate in a competition this year, an old Swedish lady told me that she would send her children to Beijing to study when they grew up. They regard Chairman Mao as the helmsman of world revolution and the Chinese Communist Party as the great standard-bearer of the international communist movement. A Swedish athlete said to me: "Any meeting in the world without Chinese participation is not enough." It can be seen that our great Party and our great Chairman Mao enjoy the highest prestige among the people of the world. You small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, will never be allowed by all the revolutionary people of the world.
    In the old society, my family suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the landlords. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the people of the whole country to overthrow the three great mountains, my father and I would have died in that coal pit long ago. A poor child like me, for more than ten years, under the cultivation of the Party, has become a speed skater and often participates in international competitions. It was Chairman Mao who saved me, cultivated me, and educated me. Only what the Communist Party and Chairman Mao say is what we want to hear. Whenever I recall the past and present, I feel a strong love for Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. Every word and every deed of Chairman Mao makes me feel even more cordial. But today, you want our Party to step down to "rest." I want to sternly warn Deng Tuo: The Party and Chairman Mao are our lifeline. You and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are secretly exerting your strength to overthrow the leadership of our Party and uproot our lifeline. Then we will have an eternal hatred for you and we must overthrow you and defeat you. In this life-and-death struggle, no matter who supports you or what tricks you play, don't even think about getting away with it. We will use ice skates to dig out the old roots of you poisonous weeds and vow to defend socialism to the death.

    我从心眼里热爱毛主席
    正告邓拓：你们要推翻我们党的领导，我们就跟你们有刻骨之恨。我们一定要把毒草的老根子挖出来。
    速度滑冰运动员　王金玉
    邓拓你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，竟敢狂妄地叫喊要我们敬爱的党赶快下台“休息”，“什么话都不要说，什么事都不能做”，一切听从你们的“指导”。你们的目的就是要推翻以毛主席为首的党中央的领导。你们这种阴谋，不仅全中国人民不答应，就是在全世界一切革命的人民面前也是通不过的。我作为一个速度滑冰运动员，曾八次到国外参加国际速度滑冰比赛。我亲身感受到了全世界一切革命的人民对我们的伟大领袖毛主席是多么爱戴。我们中国的运动员，不管在哪里都是最受欢迎，最受尊重的。我们每到一处都会被群众围起来，欢呼“中国——毛泽东，中国——毛泽东！”说明了我们国家，我们伟大的党，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在全世界一切革命人民的心目中威望是多么高。在国外，许多人心向北京。今年我去瑞典参加比赛，一个瑞典老太太对我说，将来她的孩子长大以后，要送到北京来学习。他们把毛主席看成是世界革命的舵手，把中国共产党看成是国际共产主义运动伟大的旗手。一个瑞典运动员对我说：“在世界上凡是没有中国人参加的会议，就很不够意思”。可以见得，我们伟大的党，伟大的毛主席，在全世界人民中间享有最高的威信。你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，妄想推翻以毛主席为首的党中央的领导，全世界一切革命的人民是决不允许的。
    在旧社会，我们一家受尽了地主的剥削和压迫。要不是共产党，毛主席领导全国人民推翻了三座大山，我和父亲不知早死到那个煤坑里了。象我这样一个穷苦的孩子，十几年来，在党的培养下，成了一名速度滑冰运动员，还经常参加国际比赛，这是毛主席救了我，培养了我，教育了我。只有共产党、毛主席所说的，才是我们的心腹之音。每当我忆起今昔之事来，我从心眼里对毛主席发出强烈的爱，毛主席每说一句话，每做一件事，我都感到倍加亲切。可是，今天你们要让我们党下台“休息”，我要正告邓拓：党和毛主席就是我们的命根子，你们和地富反坏右一起暗地使劲，要推翻我们党的领导，拔掉我们的命根子，那我们对你们就有刻骨之恨，一定要斗垮你们，打倒你们。在这场你死我活的斗争中，不管你们受什么人的支持，耍什么花招，都休想过关，我们要用冰刀把你们这些毒草的老根子挖出来，誓死保卫社会主义。
