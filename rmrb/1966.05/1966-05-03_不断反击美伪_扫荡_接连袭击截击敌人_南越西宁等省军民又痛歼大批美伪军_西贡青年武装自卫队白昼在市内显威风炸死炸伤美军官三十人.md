    Hanoi, May 2nd (Xinhua News Agency) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, in April, the Liberation Army and guerrillas of Tay Ninh, Rach Gia, Can Tho, Gia Dinh, My Tho, Ba Ria and other provinces in South Vietnam continuously repulsed the enemy's "mopping-up" operations and attacked the enemy, achieving new victories.
    In Tay Ninh province, with the coordination of local troops, the guerrillas successively defeated three "mopping-up" operations launched by the US aggressor troops against Chau Thanh District and Chan Bon District in early and mid-April, killing and wounding 218 US aggressors. During this period, the guerrillas also repeatedly repelled the raiding activities of the puppet army's commandos, and sneaked into towns in enemy-occupied areas to attack the enemy, eliminating a total of 63 enemy troops.
    From April 21 to 23, the army and people of Rach Gia and Can Tho provinces smashed a large-scale "mopping-up" operation conducted by six infantry battalions and three armored battalions of the puppet army, annihilating and disintegrating more than 360 enemy troops, shooting down and damaging five enemy aircraft, sinking and damaging eight enemy warships, and destroying one M-113 amphibious armored vehicle.
    From April 15 to 21, the guerrillas of Gia Dinh province continuously intercepted and attacked the enemy, repelling the "mopping-up" operations of the US-puppet troops against Binh Chanh, Binh Chieu and Hiep Binh communes, killing and wounding more than 100 enemy troops, capturing 16 prisoners, shooting down one US helicopter, and seizing 30 weapons.
    On the night of April 23, the My Tho Provincial Liberation Armed Forces simultaneously attacked three enemy outposts on the transportation lines. After only ten minutes of combat, these three outposts were eliminated, wiping out an entire puppet army company, killing and wounding a total of 80 enemy troops, and seizing a large number of weapons.
    On April 26, the Ba Ria Provincial Liberation Armed Forces intercepted a puppet army commando unit heading to Dat Do District for a "mopping-up" operation, wiping out an entire enemy company and seizing a batch of weapons and military supplies. At the same time, the Liberation Armed Forces also shelled the office of the puppet district chief of Dat Do District, causing the enemy to suffer many losses. In early April, guerrillas in Thua Thien Province attacked the enemy eleven times in a row, killing and wounding 71 enemy troops and destroying two military vehicles.
    On April 14, the local troops and guerrillas of Duy Xuyen District, Quang Nam Province, fiercely intercepted five platoons of the puppet security forces that were conducting "mopping-up" operations in the areas of Ta Toa and Cong Dinh, killing and wounding 46 enemy troops and destroying one military vehicle. Prior to this, on April 3, guerrillas in Hoa Vang District used mines to destroy an enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicle, killing and wounding 27 enemy troops.
    Hanoi, May 2nd (Xinhua News Agency) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, on the morning of April 18, the Saigon City Youth Armed Self-Defense Teams used hand grenades to destroy a US vehicle filled with US Air Force officers heading to Tan Son Nhut Airport at the Phu Nhuan intersection in Saigon City, killing and wounding 30 US Air Force officers on the spot. Subsequently, the Youth Armed Self-Defense Team members safely evacuated with the assistance and cover of the masses.
    This lightning-fast attack, carried out in broad daylight on the streets of Saigon, caused panic and unease within the US-puppet clique, while the citizens of Saigon were greatly inspired. They rushed to spread the news, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary heroism of the Youth Armed Self-Defense Team members who were brave, resourceful, and unafraid of danger.
