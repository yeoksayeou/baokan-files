    Mao Zedong's Books Are Our Lifeline
    Mao Zedong's Books Are the Highest Directives for All Work; We Must Study Them Daily, Study Them Forever; Our Generation Must Study Them, and Our Descendants Must Study Them.
    Zhao Shutong, Zhang Guilin, Active Participants in Studying Mao Zedong's Works, Tianjin Youth
    Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns. They will inevitably fight us to the death, and we must never underestimate these enemies." Deng Tuo is this kind of enemy without a gun. Our battle with Deng Tuo and his gang of black thugs is a life-and-death battle where no gunshots or artillery fire can be heard.
    Chairman Mao's books are the books that liberate the laboring people. Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth. When the broad masses of people master Mao Zedong Thought, the doomsday of demons and monsters will also arrive. Deng Tuo understood this, so he also directed the spearhead of his attack at the mass movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works. After the publication of Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in 1960, a new upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works swept the country in 1961. It was at this time that Deng Tuo wrote the article "Don't Shout Emptyly About Reading," in which he wantonly slandered the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, venting his deep-seated hatred for workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, and also revealing his panic and unease as his doomsday approached.
    We publicize the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works, and Deng Tuo says this is "shouting emptyly" and clamoring "don't shout emptyly." Deng Tuo also said, "Some people spend all day making plans, compiling reading lists, asking people to talk about reading methods, and enthusiastically discussing the importance of reading on many occasions. This consumes a lot of time and energy, and as a result, misleads others and misleads themselves." We want to ask, what's wrong with publicizing the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works? The matter is very clear; Deng Tuo and his ilk are afraid, they know that if the workers, peasants, and soldiers master Mao Zedong Thought, their dream of capitalist restoration will be "misled," it will be finished.
    We say that Chairman Mao's words have the greatest power and the highest prestige, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences, and that mastering Mao Zedong Thought can lead to universal understanding and invincible success. But Deng Tuo viciously slandered this as wanting to use "an injection or a dose of medicine" to "replace reading," wanting to "cultivate thousands upon thousands of intellectuals and specialized talents in one morning." A few buzzing flies cannot diminish the glory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Our successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, our basic self-sufficiency in oil, etc., which one is not a victory of Mao Zedong Thought?
    We say that Chairman Mao's books are the highest directives for all work, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of the present era. When there are problems, we should consult Chairman Mao's works. But Deng Tuo wants us to consult the dustbin of old papers. Listen to what Deng Tuo says: "Don't shout emptyly about reading; shouting about it everywhere is useless. If you feel you need the most knowledge, hurry to the library to find relevant books." According to Deng Tuo's concept, "knowledge" is the culture of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. Isn't this a conspiracy to use landlord and bourgeois ideology to corrupt people?
    We advocate that reading is learning, practice is even more important learning, and that learning should be combined with the three great revolutionary movements, and that learning should be combined with application. But Deng Tuo wants people to "make up their minds to sit down" and "honestly and earnestly read books." Deng Tuo vainly attempts to lead our youth into studies that are divorced from reality and labor, reading books to death, reading dead books, so that youth will unknowingly become paralyzed on the chairs of "peaceful evolution," becoming the social foundation for Deng Tuo's ilk to promote the conspiracy of capitalist restoration.
    Why does Deng Tuo so vehemently oppose our studying Chairman Mao's works? It is very clear that Chairman Mao's works are our sharpest ideological weapon for carrying out revolution. With this powerful ideological weapon, we will be able to see through the faces of all class enemies. Now, it is Chairman Mao's thought that has enabled us to recognize Deng Tuo and these big poisonous weeds. We must also use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon against Deng Tuo and these big poisonous weeds, pull them out, smash them, and never let them run rampant freely.
    To carry out revolution, we must study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's books are our lifeline. Deng Tuo and his ilk oppose our studying, this is wishful thinking. We must study them daily, study them forever. Our generation must study them, and our descendants must study them. Chairman Mao taught us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support." Deng Tuo opposes our studying Chairman Mao's works, so we must study Chairman Mao's works even more. We must firmly grasp the gun of Mao Zedong Thought, aim it at Deng Tuo's black gang, and fiercely fire, and we will not give up until we have completely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminated it!

    毛主席的书是我们的命根子
    毛主席的书是各项工作的最高指示，我们要天天学，永远学，我们这一代要学，子子孙孙都要学
    天津青年学习毛主席著作积极分子　赵树桐、张桂芩
    毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”邓拓就是这种不拿枪的敌人。我们和邓拓这一伙黑帮的战斗，是一场听不见枪声、炮声的你死我活的战斗。
    毛主席的书是劳动人民翻身求解放的书，毛主席的话句句是真理。广大人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，牛鬼蛇神的末日也就到了。邓拓明白这一点，所以他也把进攻的矛头指向了工农兵群众学习毛主席著作的运动。一九六○年，《毛泽东选集》第四卷出版以后，一九六一年在全国范围内掀起了学习毛主席著作的新热潮。就是在这个时候，邓拓写了《不要空喊读书》一文，大肆诬蔑学习毛主席著作的群众运动，发泄了他对工农兵学习毛主席著作的刻骨仇恨，也表露了他对自己末日将临的惊慌不安。
    我们宣传学习毛主席著作的重要性，邓拓说这是“空喊”，并且叫嚷“不要空喊”。邓拓还说什么，“有的成天在订计划，开书目，请人讲读书方法，在许多场合都很热心地泛论读书的重要性，如此这般耗费了许多时间和精力，结果误了别人也误了自己”。我们要问，宣传学习毛主席著作的重要性有什么不好？事情很明白，邓拓之流害怕了，他们知道工农兵掌握了毛泽东思想，他们复辟资本主义的美梦就要被“误”了，就要完蛋了。
    我们说毛主席的话威力最大，威信最高，一句顶一万句，掌握了毛泽东思想就能一通百通，无往而不胜。邓拓却恶毒诬蔑这是想用“打一针或者吃一服药”的办法，“来代替读书”，想在“一个早上就能培养成千上万的知识分子和专门人材”。几只苍蝇嗡嗡叫，丝毫也无损于伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。我们含有热核材料的核爆炸成功了，我们的石油基本自给了，等等，有哪一件不是毛泽东思想的胜利呢？
    我们说毛主席的书是各项工作的最高指示，毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，有了问题要向毛主席著作请教。邓拓却要我们向故纸堆请教。请听一听邓拓的话，他说：“读书不要空喊，到处叫嚷毫无用处。你觉得自己最需要什么知识，就赶快到图书馆去找有关的书籍。”按照邓拓的概念，“知识”就是地主阶级、资产阶级的文化。这不是在阴谋用地主资产阶级思想腐蚀人们，又是什么呢？
    我们主张读书是学习，实践是更重要的学习，要把学习和三大革命运动结合起来学，把学习和使用结合起来。邓拓却要人们“下定决心坐下来”，“老老实实认真读书”。邓拓妄想把我们青年引到脱离实际，脱离劳动的书斋里去，死读书，读死书，使青年在不知不觉中瘫痪在“和平演变”的椅子上，成为邓拓之流推行资本主义复辟阴谋的社会基础。
    邓拓为什么这样极力地反对我们学习毛主席著作呢？很明白，毛主席著作是我们干革命最锐利的思想武器，我们有了这个强大的思想武器就会识破一切阶级敌人的嘴脸。现在，就是毛主席的思想使我们认识了邓拓这些大毒草。对邓拓这些大毒草，我们也要用毛泽东思想作武器，拔掉他们，打烂他们，决不叫他们自由泛滥。
    干革命就必须学习毛主席著作，毛主席的书是我们的命根子，邓拓之流反对我们学，这是妄想。我们要天天学，永远学。我们这一代要学，子子孙孙都要学。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护。”邓拓反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就更要学习毛主席著作。我们一定紧握毛泽东思想这杆枪，对准邓拓黑帮猛烈地开火，不彻底、干净、全部地消灭它，决不罢休！
