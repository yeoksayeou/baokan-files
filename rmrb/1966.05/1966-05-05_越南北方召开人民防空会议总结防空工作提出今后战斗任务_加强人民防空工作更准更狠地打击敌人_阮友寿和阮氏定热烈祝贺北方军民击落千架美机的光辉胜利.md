    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th - According to Hanoi newspapers today, the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recently convened the Third People's Air Defense Conference of North Vietnam. It summarized the people's air defense work against the destructive war of the American bandits and put forward the task of strengthening the all-people air defense in the future.
    Prime Minister Pham Van Dong attended the meeting and spoke.
    Representatives from provinces such as Quang Binh, Nghe An, Yen Bai, Ha Tinh, and Thanh Hoa, as well as Nam Dinh city, delivered reports at the meeting. These reports showed that, over the past year, the army and people of North Vietnam, carrying forward the heroic and unyielding fighting tradition, have thwarted the destructive war waged by American imperialism with its air force and shattered its conspiracy to salvage the predicament on the South Vietnamese battlefield.
    The meeting pointed out that the movement of the entire people to fight enemy aircraft is developing more widely and vigorously in North Vietnam and has achieved brilliant results. The army and people of the entire North have shot down more than a thousand American bandit aircraft.
    The meeting pointed out that the general task of the current people's air defense work in North Vietnam is to give full play to all the capabilities of the local armed forces, resolutely and more accurately and ruthlessly strike the enemy, and at the same time promote the people's air defense work.
    The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to educate and mobilize the entire people to constantly recognize the enemy's conspiracies, recognize the importance, urgency, and long-term nature of the people's air defense work, raise vigilance, and be able to protect the people's lives and property well in any complex situation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 4th - According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, and Nguyen Thi Dinh, Deputy Commander of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, sent telegrams to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army on April 30, respectively, warmly congratulating the army and people of North Vietnam on shooting down the one thousandth American bandit aircraft.
    Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho said in the telegram that this feat of the army and people of North Vietnam announced to the world that America's "air superiority" had gone bankrupt and that its destructive war against North Vietnam had suffered a shameful defeat. The feats of the Northern army and people exposed the weak nature of American imperialism to all the people and demonstrated the invincible power of people's war.
    The telegram said that the army and people of South Vietnam are determined to learn from the heroism of the Northern army and people, and fight alongside them to defeat the American imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam, so as to liberate the South, defend the North, and then unify the motherland.
    Deputy Commander Nguyen Thi Dinh pointed out in the telegram that the Northern army and people's shooting down of a thousand American bandit aircraft punctured the deceptive myth of the American aggressors' so-called "air superiority" and proved that America's various most modern aircraft, including the B-52, are just paper tigers that can only intimidate the timid people and can never intimidate the heroic Vietnamese people.

    越南北方召开人民防空会议总结防空工作提出今后战斗任务
    加强人民防空工作更准更狠地打击敌人
    阮友寿和阮氏定热烈祝贺北方军民击落千架美机的光辉胜利
    新华社河内四日电　据河内报纸今天报道，越南民主共和国总理府最近召开越南北方第三次人民防空会议，总结反对美国强盗破坏性战争的人民防空工作，提出了今后加强全民防空的任务。
    范文同总理出席了会议，并且讲了话。
    广平、义安、安沛、河静、清化等省和南定市等地的代表在会上作了报告。这些报告说明，一年多来，越南北方军民发扬英勇不屈的战斗传统，挫败了美帝国主义用空军进行的破坏性战争，粉碎了它企图挽救在越南南方战场上的困境而进行的阴谋。
    会议指出，全民打敌机的运动正在越南北方日益广泛和蓬勃地开展着，并且取得了辉煌的战果。全北方军民已击落一千多架美国强盗飞机。
    会议指出当前越南北方人民防空工作的总任务是：高度发挥地方武装力量的一切能力，坚决地更准更狠地打击敌人，同时促进人民防空工作。
    会议指出，必须教育和动员全体人民经常认清敌人的阴谋，认清人民防空工作的重要性、迫切性和长期性，提高警惕，在任何复杂情况下，都能够很好地保卫人民的生命财产。
    据新华社河内四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿和越南南方解放武装力量副司令员阮氏定四月三十日分别打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南人民军总司令部，热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落第一千架美国强盗飞机。
    阮友寿主席在电报中说，越南北方军民的这一战功，向全世界宣布了美国的“空中优势”已经破产，它对越南北方进行的破坏性战争已经遭到了可耻的失败。北方军民的战功，向全体人民揭露了美帝国主义的虚弱本质，显示了人民战争的无敌力量。
    电报说，越南南方军民决心学习北方军民的英雄气概，同北方军民并肩一起击败美帝国主义对越南的侵略战争，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
    阮氏定副司令员在电报中指出，北方军民击落一千架美国强盗飞机，戳穿了美国侵略者所谓“空中优势”的骗人神话，并且证明：美国的各种最现代化的飞机，包括B—52型飞机在内，只是纸老虎，它只能恫吓那些胆小的人，决不能恫吓英雄的越南人民。
