    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 16th — Mao Zedong's works and Chinese revolutionary books were warmly welcomed by a wide audience at the 11th International Book Fair, which opened in Warsaw.
    The 11th International Book Fair opened on the 14th, with twenty-three countries participating in the exhibition. China International Bookstore exhibited more than 300 kinds of publications at the fair, including Mao Zedong's works and publications reflecting China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, as well as the Chinese people's struggle to aid Vietnam and resist America.
    The 15th was the first day the book fair was officially open, and the number of visitors eagerly reading Chinese books reached more than two thousand. Many visitors lingered there for a long time, reading Mao Zedong's works and expressing their love for Mao Zedong's works and the Chinese people to the Chinese staff.
    A university student in Warsaw said, "I very much need Mao Zedong's works and hope to be able to obtain them." Another vocational school student said, "We really want to know Comrade Mao Zedong's views, especially on the issues of war and peace." He also said, "China's recent nuclear explosion proves China's strength and increasing power." A visitor, pointing to Mao Zedong's works and addressing his daughter, said, "Remember, this is Mao Zedong, the leader of the powerful People's China." He firmly shook the hand of a Chinese staff member and said, "I salute the Chinese people who are fighting for justice!"
    An elderly visitor led his three daughters and requested to take a group photo with the Chinese comrades next to Mao Zedong's works. Many visitors also wrote wishes for China in the guestbook. One visitor wrote, "We congratulate you—our dear friends—on building communism as soon as possible!" Another visitor wrote, "We wish our Chinese comrades good achievements in building their great country, in defending peace, and in the struggle for the victory of socialism throughout the world."

    新华社华沙十六日电　毛泽东著作和中国的革命图书，在华沙开幕的第十一届国际图书博览会上，受到广大观众的热烈欢迎。
    第十一届国际图书博览会十四日开幕，二十三个国家参加了这次展出。中国国际书店在博览会上展出了毛泽东著作和反映中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设、中国人民援越抗美斗争等方面的出版物三百多种。
    十五日是博览会正式开放的第一天，热烈争阅中国图书的观众即达两千多人。许多观众久久地停留在那里翻阅毛泽东著作，并且向中国工作人员表示他们热爱毛泽东著作，热爱中国人民。
    华沙一位大学生说，“我很需要毛泽东著作，希望能够得到它。”另一个专科学校的学生说，“我们很想知道毛泽东同志的观点，特别是战争与和平问题上的观点。”他还说，“中国最近进行的核爆炸证明了中国的强大和威力的增长。”一位观众拉着他的女儿指着毛泽东著作说，“你记住，这就是强大的人民中国的领袖毛泽东。”他紧紧地握着中国工作人员的手说，“我向为正义而斗争的中国人民致敬！”
    一位老年观众领着他的三个女儿要求和中国同志在毛泽东著作旁边合影留念。许多观众还在留言簿上写下了对中国的祝愿。一位观众留言说，“我们祝贺你们——亲爱的朋友们尽快地建成共产主义！”另一位观众写道，“祝我们中国同志们在建设自己伟大的国家中，在保卫和平，为社会主义在全世界的胜利而进行的斗争中取得良好的成就。”
