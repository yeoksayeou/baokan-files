    According to Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, May 25th: The Soviet revisionist leading clique recently sent representatives to Bangkok to participate in the "Asian Radio and Television Education Conference." This is the seventh time since last October that Soviet representatives have sat together with representatives from the United States, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, South Vietnam, South Korea, and other puppet groups in Southeast Asia to attend a meeting.
    This conference, sponsored and controlled by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, began on the 16th and ended on the 23rd. The Director of the Thai Public Relations Department, Jit Bunnag, told reporters after the meeting that the conference was held in an atmosphere "full of friendly cooperation and pleasantness."
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 24th: The US imperialists and the Japanese Sato government recently held a so-called "International Education Art Exhibition" in Hong Kong with the aim of plotting to create "Two Chinas." The Soviet revisionist leading clique openly sent exhibits to participate in the exhibition.
    These exhibits were hung together with exhibits sent by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the South Korean puppet group, and "Malaysia." This exhibition was sponsored in the name of the "Japan Education Art Promotion Association" and was supported by the "UNESCO Japanese Committee" under the "United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization" controlled by US imperialism, as well as the Japanese Prime Minister's Office, the Foreign Ministry (外交部), and the Ministry of Education (教育部).
    Before the opening of the exhibition, the organizers printed large promotional posters that brazenly placed the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang alongside the national flags of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, Japan, and other countries. The organizers also blatantly hung the flag of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang together with the national flag of the People's Republic of China at the exhibition venue, and labeled the Chiang bandit gang's flag as "Republic of China" while labeling the Chinese flag as "China." The US-Japanese reactionaries' conspiracy to create "Two Chinas" has been exposed and condemned by local newspapers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 26th: The Soviet revisionist leading clique has once again sent representatives to sit together with representatives from the Chiang Kai-shek group and the South Vietnam and South Korean puppet groups to attend a meeting. This is the "Asian Books Publishing and Distribution Experts Conference" convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which began in Tokyo on the 25th. The United States also sent observers to attend the meeting. Japanese newspapers said that the meeting will discuss the so-called "promotion of book publishing and distribution in Asia."

    苏联修正主义集团又同美蒋勾勾搭搭
    接连同美蒋南越和南朝鲜傀儡等坐一条板凳并参加美日玩弄“两个中国”阴谋的展览会
    据新华社二十五日讯　曼谷消息：苏联修正主义领导集团，最近派代表到曼谷去参加“亚洲无线电和电视教育会议”。这是自从去年十月以来，苏联代表第七次在东南亚地区同美国、台湾蒋介石集团、南越、南朝鲜等傀儡集团的代表坐在一起开会。
    由联合国教育、科学及文化组织主办和控制的这次会议，从十六日开始到二十三日结束。泰国民众联络厅长吉·本那干在会后对新闻记者说，这次会议是在“充满友好合作和愉快的气氛中”举行的。
    新华社香港二十四日电  美帝国主义和日本佐藤政府最近在香港举办了一个以阴谋制造“两个中国”为目的的所谓“国际教育美术展览”，苏联修正主义领导集团公然送去展览品参加展出。
    这些展品同蒋介石匪帮、南朝鲜傀儡集团和“马来西亚”送去的展品挂在一起。这个展览会是以“日本教育美术振兴会”名义主办的，并且得到了美帝国主义控制的、“联合国教科文组织”属下的“联合国教科文组织日本委员会”和日本的首相办公室、外务省（外交部）、文部省（教育部）的赞助。
    展览会开幕前，主办者印制了大幅的宣传招贴画，画上竟把蒋介石匪帮的旗子同美、苏、英、日等国的国旗并排印在一起。主办者还明目张胆地把蒋介石匪帮的旗子同中华人民共和国国旗悬挂在展览会场上，并且在蒋匪帮的旗子上标上“中华民国”，而在中国国旗上标上“中国”的字样。美日反动派制造“两个中国”的阴谋遭到了当地报纸的揭露和谴责。
    新华社东京二十六日电  苏联修正主义领导集团又一次派代表同蒋介石集团和南越、南朝鲜傀儡集团的代表坐在一起开会。这是由联合国教育、科学及文化组织召开的“亚洲书籍出版和发行的专家会议”，二十五日开始在东京举行。美国也派了观察员出席这次会议。日本报纸说，会议将讨论所谓“促进在亚洲的书籍出版和发行问题”。
