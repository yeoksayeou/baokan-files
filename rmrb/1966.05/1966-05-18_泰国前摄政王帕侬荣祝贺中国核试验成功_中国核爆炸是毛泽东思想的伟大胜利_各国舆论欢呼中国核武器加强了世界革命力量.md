    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China received a letter on the 11th from former Thai Regent, Pridi Banomyong, congratulating China on the success of its nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials.

    The congratulatory letter said, "China's test explosion containing thermonuclear materials represents a further great achievement in science and technology. I take this opportunity to express my extreme congratulations to you and the Chinese people. Congratulations on the victory of hard struggle and self-reliance under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, congratulations on the great victory of the General Line, congratulations on the great victory of the Three Great Revolutionary Movements, and congratulations on the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

    The congratulatory letter said: "China's development of nuclear weapons is not only beneficial to national defense, but also a contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, it is also an encouragement to the people all over the world who are resolutely fighting for freedom."

    The congratulatory letter said: "The US imperialists and revisionists who want to monopolize nuclear weapons are bound to fail!"

    The congratulatory letter concluded by wishing the Chinese people greater victories and achievements in all fields.

    Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency: Public opinion in various countries continues to cheer the success of China's third nuclear test, emphasizing that China's achievements in developing nuclear weapons have strengthened the revolutionary forces of the world and are a heavy blow to US imperialist nuclear threats.

    Pathet Lao Radio broadcast a commentary on the 12th, saying that in the face of US imperialist nuclear blackmail, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, successfully conducted their third nuclear explosion. This achievement has strengthened China's national defense and has made a major contribution to strengthening the world national liberation movement. This achievement has also effectively opposed US imperialist nuclear threats.

    The commentary said, "China has every right to possess nuclear weapons to defend its motherland and prevent the aggressive imperialist chieftain, US imperialism, from threatening and invading its country. China's possession of nuclear weapons is not like that of US imperialism, which uses them to invade other countries. Therefore, China's successful nuclear explosion is of extremely great significance. People of all countries in the world who aspire to national independence and love peace are infinitely inspired by the success of China's nuclear explosion."

    The commentary said that 650 million Chinese people have consistently and continuously supported the Lao people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation.

    Abdul Latif Deifalla, Minister of Public Works of Yemen, said while visiting the construction project of the Sana'a Textile Factory, which was being built with Chinese assistance: "China's nuclear explosion is for the service of mankind and to safeguard world peace." "China's nuclear explosion will strengthen the strength of the people of the world."

    Abdullah Sur, Director-General of the Yemen News Department, told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 10th: "The successful explosion of China's nuclear test is a great victory achieved by the People's Republic of China. The strengthening of China's nuclear power has strengthened the revolutionary forces of the world."

    Ahmed Roueni, Director of Sana'a Radio, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: "China's nuclear test explosion is to safeguard world peace. China's possession of nuclear weapons can prevent the outbreak of nuclear war. I believe China will not be the first to use nuclear weapons."

    Ahmed Al-Ansi, First Assistant to the Commander-in-Chief of Yemen, said: "China's progress and advancement is our victory. We wish China eternal progress."

    The Sinhalese weekly "Labour News" of the Ceylon Communist Party published an editorial entitled "Long Live" on the 17th, cheering the recent success of China's third nuclear test.

    The editorial said: "The success of the (nuclear) test of People's China, the most reliable and revolutionary fortress of contemporary mankind struggling for national liberation, has made the people of all countries who are fighting heroically against imperialism, modern revisionism and for national independence feel jubilant."

    The editorial praised China for breaking the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and modern revisionism. The editorial pointed out that the days when imperialism could no longer use nuclear weapons to blackmail and suppress unarmed people and the Soviet revisionism could no longer boast about its possession of nuclear weapons are not far off.

    泰国前摄政王帕侬荣祝贺中国核试验成功
    中国核爆炸是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    各国舆论欢呼中国核武器加强了世界革命力量
    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来收到了泰国前摄政王比里·帕侬荣十一日的一封信，祝贺中国进行含有热核材料的核爆炸成功。
    贺信说，“中国试验含有热核材料的爆炸，在科学技术方面取得了进一步的伟大的成就，我借此机会向您和中国人民表示极大的祝贺。祝贺在中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下艰苦奋斗、自力更生的胜利，祝贺总路线的伟大胜利，祝贺三大革命运动的伟大胜利和毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”
    贺信说：“中国发展核武器，不仅为了有利于国防，而且是对保卫亚洲、世界和平的贡献，因此，也是对正在为争取自由而坚决斗争的全世界人民的鼓舞。”
    贺信说：“想垄断核武器的美帝国主义和修正主义必败！”
    贺信最后祝中国人民各方面取得更大的胜利和成就。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国公众舆论继续欢呼中国第三次核试验成功，强调中国在发展核武器方面取得的成就，加强了世界的革命力量，是对美帝国主义核威胁的沉重打击。
    巴特寮电台十二日发表评论说，面对着美帝国主义的核讹诈，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，成功地进行了第三次核爆炸。这一成就增强了中国的国防力量，同时对加强世界民族解放运动的力量作出了重大贡献，这一成就也是有效地反对了美帝国主义的核威胁。
    评论说，“中国完全有权掌握核武器来保卫自己的祖国，不让侵略成性的帝国主义头子——美帝国主义威胁和侵略自己的国家。中国掌握核武器不象美帝国主义那样用来侵略别的国家。因此，中国成功地进行核爆炸有着极其重大的意义。世界上渴望民族独立和热爱和平的各国人民都对中国核爆炸的成功感到无限振奋。”
    评论说，六亿五千万中国人民始终如一地不断支持老挝人民抗美救国斗争。
    也门公共工程部长阿卜杜勒·拉蒂夫·德伊法拉在参观由中国帮助建设的萨那纺织厂的建筑工程时说：“中国进行核爆炸是为人类服务和保卫世界和平的。”“中国的核爆炸将加强世界人民的力量。”
    也门新闻部总主任阿卜杜拉·苏尔十日对新华社记者说：“中国核试验爆炸成功，是中华人民共和国取得的伟大胜利。中国核力量的加强，加强了世界的革命力量。”
    萨那电台台长艾哈迈德·鲁埃尼对新华社记者说：“中国的核试验爆炸是为了保卫世界和平。中国拥有了核武器，就能防止爆发核战争。我相信中国不会首先使用核武器。”
    也门总司令第一助理艾哈迈德·阿兰西说：“中国的前进和进步就是我们的胜利。我们祝中国永远前进。”
    锡兰共产党的僧伽罗文周刊《劳工报》十七日发表题为《万岁》的社论，欢呼最近中国第三次核试验成功。
    社论说：“为争取民族解放而斗争的当代人类最可靠、最革命的堡垒——人民中国的（核）试验成功，使为反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和争取民族独立而英勇斗争的各国人民感到欢欣鼓舞。”
    社论赞扬中国打破了帝国主义和现代修正主义的核垄断。社论指出，帝国主义不再能用核武器讹诈和镇压没有武装的人民和苏联修正主义不再能为它拥有核武器吹嘘的日子已经为期不远了。
