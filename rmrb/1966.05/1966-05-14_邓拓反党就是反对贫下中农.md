    Expose the anti-Party, anti-socialist elements to the sunlight, illuminate their black faces, penetrate their black hearts, expose their black language, and smash their black dens.
    Geng Changsuo, National Model Agricultural Laborer, Director of Wu Gong Commune and Captain of Wu Gong Brigade, Raoyang County
    After reading the materials published in the newspaper exposing Deng Tuo and his small group's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, I felt very angry. Deng Tuo and his ilk actually used newspapers and magazines to peddle a large amount of anti-Party and anti-socialist black merchandise, viciously attacking our great Party, scolding our Party as "fanatical" and "running a fever," saying "great empty words," arrogantly shouting for our Party to step down and "rest" quickly, and also slandering the socialist construction led by the Party as "finished," slandering the Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big," and so on. Obviously, this is a frenzied attack by class enemies against the Party, a conspiracy to overthrow the Communist Party, a fantasy of "changing the sky," so that they can once again ride on the backs of the people and act like overlords. I want to tell you: The country that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to conquer, the people have settled down in. The sky will not change. Your wishful thinking is nothing but daydreaming, it can't be done!
    We poor and lower-middle peasants have deeply realized in the long revolutionary struggle that only the Communist Party is the only great savior of the Chinese people; without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and there would be nothing for the poor and lower-middle peasants; whoever opposes the Communist Party opposes the poor and lower-middle peasants, and we will fight them to the end; only the road pointed out to us by the Communist Party is the broad road, the road to victory. Let's take the affairs of our brigade as an example! Before liberation, it was a poor village, and in a good year, one mu of land could not produce more than a hundred jin of grain. Eighty percent of the peasants worked hard for a year and could not eat enough or keep warm. In 1943, there was a severe drought, and fifteen people in the village starved to death, and more than a hundred people fell ill. I also starved and got sick. In the winter of that year, according to Chairman Mao's great call to "get organized," we established the "Land Partnership Group" and started our business with three big hoes. Later, under the direction of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, from the elementary cooperative to the advanced cooperative, production became better year by year, and life became stronger year by year. In particular, after the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958 and the implementation of the General Line, a good situation of an all-round Great Leap Forward in agricultural production appeared. The entire brigade dug more than forty good wells, dug sixty-five canals, and basically realized "four modernizations." At the same time, the commune, relying on public accumulation, established farm tool repair and assembly plants and power plants, and provided strong support to various brigades. Last year, we encountered a drought even more severe than in 1943, but our brigade achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a yield of more than 740 jin of grain per mu. With an average of 1.4 mu of land per person, we sold 200,000 jin of grain, more than 40,000 jin of ginned cotton, and more than 10,000 jin of edible oil to the state, and the lives of the commune members have also been greatly improved. This is the result of the Party's leadership, the result of the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune! It is the result of the poor and lower-middle peasants being the masters of their own affairs!
    Let me talk about a recent major event! On May 9, our country successfully conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, and two atomic bombs had been exploded before. We say that this is a great victory for the Party's general line of socialist construction, a great victory for the three great revolutionary movements, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This fact shows that it is not that the socialist construction is "finished," but that your black den is about to be finished; it is not that we are "bragging" or "talking empty words," this is a true fact, unless you stubbornly open your eyes and tell lies.
    I want to solemnly tell those anti-Party and anti-socialist elements that the Communist Party cannot be overthrown by any enemy. The Party is used to being scolded by enemies, and it has grown and strengthened in the curses of various enemies. The more the enemy scolds our Party, the more it shows that we are doing the right thing. This was the case in the past and is the case now, and it will certainly be the case in the future. We, the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, will more firmly unite around the Chinese Communist Party, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, drag you out into the sunlight, and we will illuminate your black faces, penetrate your black hearts, expose your black language, and smash your black dens, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

### 邓拓反党就是反对贫下中农

    邓拓反党就是反对贫下中农
    把反党反社会主义分子，拉到阳光下来，照清他们的黑脸，照透他们的黑心，揭穿他们的黑话，砸碎他们的黑店
    全国农业劳动模范、饶阳县五公公社社长兼五公大队长　耿长锁
    我看了报纸上揭发的邓拓一小伙人反党反社会主义的材料以后，心里非常生气。邓拓他们竟然利用报纸和杂志，大量贩卖反党反社会主义的黑货，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，辱骂我们党“狂热”、“发高烧”，说“伟大的空话”，狂妄地叫喊要我们党赶快下台“休息”，还污蔑党领导的社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了，污蔑大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”等等。很明显，这是阶级敌人向党的猖狂进攻，阴谋推翻共产党，幻想“变天”，好重新骑在人民头上作威作福。我要告诉你们：共产党、毛主席领导我们打下的江山，人民是坐定了。天是不会变的。你们的胡思乱想不过是白日作梦，办不到！
    我们贫下中农，在长期的革命斗争中深深体会到：只有共产党，才是中国人民唯一的大救星；没有共产党，就没有新中国，就没有贫下中农的一切；谁反对共产党，谁就是反对贫下中农，我们就要跟谁斗到底；只有共产党指给我们的大道才是阳关大道，是通向胜利的大道。就拿我们大队的事来说吧！解放前是个穷村，好年景一亩地打不过百十斤粮食，百分之八十的农民苦干一年吃不饱穿不暖。一九四三年大旱，全村十五人饿死了，一百多人病倒了，我也饿病了。就在这一年冬天，我们按照毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，成立了“土地合伙组”，靠三把大镐创业。后来，我们又按党中央和毛主席指引的方向，从初级社到高级社，生产一年比一年好，生活一年比一年强。特别是一九五八年成立了人民公社，贯彻了总路线以后，农业生产更出现了全面大跃进的好局面。全大队打了四十多眼好井，挖好了六十五条渠道，基本上实现了“四化”。同时，公社依靠公共积累，建立了农具修配厂、发电厂，对各大队进行了大力支持。去年遇到了比一九四三年还严重的大旱，我们大队却获得空前丰收，亩产粮食七百四十多斤。在每人平均一亩四分地的情况下，卖给国家二十万斤粮食，四万多斤皮棉，一万多斤食油，社员生活也有很大提高。这是党领导的结果，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社胜利的结果！是贫下中农当家作主的结果！
    再说个最近的大事吧！五月九日我国成功地进行了一次含有热核材料的核爆炸，以前还爆炸过两颗原子弹。我们说，这是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，这是三大革命运动的伟大胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这个事实说明，不是社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了，而是你们的黑店快完蛋了；不是我们“吹牛皮”、“说空话”，这是千真万确的事实，除非你们硬睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    我要正告那些反党反社会主义的分子们，共产党是任何敌人都骂不倒的，党是被敌人骂惯了的，也是在各式各样的敌人咒骂声中发展壮大起来的。敌人越骂我们党，这说明我们做的越正确。过去、现在是这样，将来也一定是这样。我们广大贫下中农，将更加坚定的团结在中国共产党的周围，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把你们拉到阳光下来，非照清你们的黑脸，照透你们的黑心，揭穿你们的黑话，砸碎你们的黑店不可，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底！
