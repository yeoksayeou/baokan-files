    Revolutionary Youngsters Vigorously Smash "Authority"
    Guangzhou No. 4 Middle School Senior High (4) Class Had Already Sternly Condemned Wu Han's "On Integrity" as a Major Poisonous Weed the Year Before Last
    *Yangcheng Evening News* Editor's Note: This is a report that makes one extremely happy to read. It vividly demonstrates that China's younger generation, once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can have a very keen ability to identify fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds, and can have the greatest courage to smash the old world and create a new world. What "authorities," "scholars," "experts," and other bourgeois intellectuals are nothing to worry about.
    We are jubilant for the rapid growth of China's younger generation, for the continuous emergence of China's revolutionary youngsters, and for the fact that China's communist cause has successors. American imperialism and modern revisionists, aren't you hoping every day to achieve some kind of "peaceful evolution" in China's third and fourth generations? Let us tell you, it can't be done, it absolutely cannot be done!
    According to a report by *Yangcheng Evening News* on the 22nd, students of Senior High (4) Class of Guangzhou No. 4 Middle School discovered as early as the first semester of 1964 that Wu Han's article "On Integrity" was a major poisonous weed and launched a resolute struggle against Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political stance and academic viewpoints. In the struggle, they treated Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions, broke down the superstition towards bourgeois "experts," peeled off Wu Han's mask, and saw through the black goods he was peddling.
    In the autumn of 1964, the students in this class had just entered their second year of senior high school. Teacher Liu of the Chinese language class printed and distributed Wu Han's article "On Integrity" to them, and recommended that the article was "clear in its arguments, sufficient in its evidence, tight in its structure, and strong in its logic," requesting the students to study it well and analyze the writing characteristics of the article in class. On the night before the classroom analysis, the two Mao Zedong Thought study groups in this class were conducting study activities. When the students talked about this article, many people immediately keenly noticed its reactionary nature, especially the definition of integrity in the article, which completely departed from Chairman Mao's class analysis and the class viewpoint of the proletariat. They elected Pan Huiming, the leader of the Mao Zedong Thought study group, to speak in class.
    This class happened to be a demonstration teaching class, and all the Chinese language teachers of the entire grade came to observe. When Teacher Liu asked a question, Pan Huiming answered loudly according to the students' opinions: "We believe that this article is not talking about the integrity of the proletariat!" The answer was beyond the expectations of Teacher Liu. He disagreed with the student's view and asked the students not to talk about the ideological content of the article first, but to analyze the writing characteristics of the article. However, more students ignored the framework specified by the teacher and scrambled to raise their hands to speak, refuting the article's erroneous viewpoints one after another. A demonstration teaching class became a criticism meeting of Wu Han.
    The school Party organization learned about this debate and believed that the students' criticism was correct and their refutation was good, and actively encouraged the students to continue to discuss it in depth.
    At this time, some people said: "Wu Han is the Deputy Mayor of Beijing and a historian, how could he be wrong?" Some people said: "The article has been published in newspapers and magazines, it can't be wrong." Some people said: "The teacher assigned it, it can't be wrong." The Communist Youth League branch of this class keenly realized that this was a class struggle in the ideological field, and to win in this struggle, it was necessary to rely on Mao Zedong Thought. The League branch quickly organized the students to study "Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art", calling on the students to analyze problems with Chairman Mao's thought and find the correct answers, regardless of what "authorities," "experts," or "scholars" were, anything that violated Mao Zedong Thought was wrong and should be opposed. Under the leadership of the League branch, all the students in the class actively took action, forming groups and fully carrying out debates and criticisms.
    In the debate, the students first believed that Wu Han's definition of integrity completely violated Chairman Mao's class analysis. Wu Han said: "Consistently and bravely serving the interests of his own class" is "integrity." The students said that this is a trans-class "integrity" applicable to any class and any era. According to this logic, in socialist China, the landlord class stubbornly resisting to the end and the bourgeoisie resolutely refusing socialist transformation would also be considered to have "integrity"?
    The students also pointed out that although Wu Han disguised himself in the article with the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, saying that "different societies have different meanings of integrity, with class distinctions." These words did increase its deceptive nature. However, everyone questioned why Wu Han asked us in the article to "learn" from those "many ancestors with integrity who steadfastly served the interests of their own class"? What "ancestors of one's own class"? Ancestors of the landlord class? Ancestors of the poor peasants? Wu Han, like any bourgeois reactionary scholar, is superficially trans-class, but in fact, he is peddling bourgeois integrity, inducing young people to deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and the integrity of the proletariat.
    In the debate, the students also focused on analyzing the social background of the publication of "On Integrity." This article was published in the spring of 1961, when China was encountering temporary economic difficulties, and class enemies at home and abroad were taking this opportunity to launch a major attack on the people. Internationally, imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists launched a chorus of anti-China and anti-communist activities. Domestically, monsters and demons were stirring up a "going-it-alone wind" and a "reversal of verdicts wind." Under these circumstances, what was Wu Han's purpose in vigorously promoting trans-class "integrity" and advocating "integrity that steadfastly serves the interests of one's own class"? The students said that this was an attempt to hold back students from exploiting class backgrounds and non-worker-peasant family backgrounds; for those who insisted on reactionary class standpoints, it played a role of instigation and support. This was blatantly instigating monsters and demons to attack the Party and to be enemies of the people to the end. Wu Han's intentions were very malicious.
    After this debate, all the students in the class unified their understanding and believed that "On Integrity" was a major poisonous weed that must be resolutely eradicated!
    After this debate, the students realized that they could not blindly believe in any "authority." What we obey is Mao Zedong Thought, the truth of the proletarian revolution, not any bourgeois "authority." As long as we hold the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought in our hands, no bourgeois "authority" is worth mentioning, all can be overthrown, and will certainly be overthrown! From then on, the students more consciously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in a living way.
    After this debate, the students realized that the class struggle is long-term and complex, and they understood that they must use a class viewpoint to analyze and handle all problems in order to grasp the essence of things and not be deceived by complex illusions.
    After the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy of the "Three-Family Village" black shop was fully exposed, the students in this class further recognized Wu Han's ugly face and deeply criticized the criminal activities of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. They said that we are about to graduate, and we will not only take over hammers, mallets, hoes, and guns, but also seize the cultural and academic positions that were monopolized by bourgeois "authorities" in the past, eradicate poisonous weeds, and eliminate black gangs!

### 在毛泽东思想哺育下敢想敢闯敢革命  革命小将大破“权威”  广州四中高三（四）班前年就已严斥吴晗《谈骨气》是大毒草

    在毛泽东思想哺育下敢想敢闯敢革命
    革命小将大破“权威”
    广州四中高三（四）班前年就已严斥吴晗《谈骨气》是大毒草
    《羊城晚报》编者按：这是一篇读了叫人万分高兴的报道。它生动地证明了我国青年一代，一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能够具有很敏锐的识别香花毒草的能力，就能够具有粉碎旧世界、创造新世界的最大勇气。什么“权威”、“学者”、“专家”等等资产阶级知识分子，统统不在话下。
    我们为我国青年一代的迅速成长，为我国革命小将的不断涌现，为我国共产主义事业后继有人而感到欢欣鼓舞。美帝国主义和现代修正主义者们，你们不是天天盼望在中国的第三代、第四代身上，实现什么“和平演变”吗？告诉你们，办不到，一万个办不到！
    据《羊城晚报》二十二日报道　广州市第四中学高三（四）班的学生远在一九六四年上学期就发现吴晗的《谈骨气》一文是一株大毒草，对吴晗反党反社会主义的政治立场和学术观点展开了坚决的斗争。在斗争中，他们把毛主席的书当作最高的指示，破除了对资产阶级“专家”的迷信，剥开了吴晗的画皮，识穿了他兜售的黑货。
    一九六四年秋天，这个班的学生刚刚进入高中第二学年。语文课刘老师把吴晗的《谈骨气》一文印发给他们，并推荐说，这篇文章“论点明确，论据充分，结构严密，逻辑性强”，要求学生们好好学习，在课堂上分析这篇文章的写作特点。在课堂分析的前一晚，这个班的两个学习毛主席著作小组在进行学习活动。同学们谈起这篇文章，许多人马上敏锐地察觉到它的反动性，特别是文中关于骨气的定义，更是完全离开了毛主席的阶级分析，离开了无产阶级的阶级观点。他们推选了毛主席著作学习小组长潘辉明在课堂上发言。
    这一堂课刚好是观摩教学课，全年级的语文教师都来旁听了。当刘老师提问的时候，潘辉明按照同学们的意见朗声回答：“我们认为这篇文章谈的不是无产阶级的骨气！”回答是出乎这位刘老师的意料的。他不同意这个学生的看法，他要求学生们先不要谈文章的思想内容，而去分析文章的写作特点。可是，更多的学生不顾这位老师指定的框框，争着举手发言，针对文章的错误观点，接连批驳。一堂观摩教学课成了对吴晗的批判会。
    学校党组织知道了这一场辩论，认为学生批得对，驳得好，积极鼓励学生们继续深入讨论。
    这时候，有些人说：“吴晗是北京的副市长，历史学家，还会错吗？”有些人说：“报刊上都发表了这篇文章，错不了。”有些人说：“老师布置的，不会错。”这个班的团支部敏锐地意识到这是一场意识形态领域中的阶级斗争，要在这场斗争中获胜，就要靠毛泽东思想。团支部迅速组织同学们学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，号召同学们以毛主席的思想去分析问题，寻找正确的答案，不管什么“权威”、“专家”、“学者”，凡是违反了毛泽东思想的就是错误的，就要反对。在团支部的带动下，全班同学都积极行动起来，组成了一个个小组，充分开展了辩论和批判。
    在辩论中，学生们首先认为，吴晗关于骨气的定义完全违背了毛主席的阶级分析。吴晗说：“始终如一地勇敢地为他的本阶级利益服务”，就是“骨气”。同学们说这是一种适用于任何阶级、任何时代的超阶级的“骨气”，按照这个逻辑去解释，那么在社会主义的我国，地主阶级顽抗到底，资产阶级坚决拒绝社会主义改造，也都是有“骨气”了？
    同学们还指出，吴晗虽然在文章中披着马克思列宁主义的伪装，说什么“社会不同，骨气的含义也是不同的，有着阶级本质的区别。”这些词句的确增加了它的迷惑性和欺骗性。但是，大家追问吴晗为什么在文中要我们“学习”那些“坚定不移地为本阶级利益服务”的“许多有骨气的祖先”呢？什么“本阶级的祖先”？地主阶级的祖先？贫农的祖先？吴晗象任何资产阶级反动学者一样，表面上是超阶级的，实际上是贩卖资产阶级的骨气，诱使青年背离毛泽东思想，背离无产阶级骨气。
    在辩论中，同学们又着重分析了《谈骨气》发表的社会背景。这篇文章发表在一九六一年春天，正是我国遇到暂时经济困难，国内外阶级敌人利用这个机会，向人民大举进攻的时候。在国际上，帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义者掀起反华反共大合唱。在国内，牛鬼蛇神正在刮起一阵“单干风”，“翻案风”。在这种形势下，吴晗竭力宣扬超阶级的“骨气”，鼓吹“坚定不移地为本阶级利益服务”的“骨气”，是什么目的呢？同学们说，这是企图拉我们出身剥削阶级和非工农家庭出身的同学的后腿；对于坚持反动阶级立场的人，则是起了煽动和支持的作用。这正是明目张胆地煽动牛鬼蛇神向党进攻，与人民为敌到底，吴晗用心是很恶毒的。
    经过这次辩论，全班学生统一了认识，认为《谈骨气》是一株大毒草，必须坚决锄掉！
    经过这次辩论，学生们认识到：不能盲目相信什么“权威”，我们服从的是毛泽东思想，是无产阶级革命的真理，而不是什么资产阶级“权威”。只要把毛泽东思想武器掌握在手，什么资产阶级“权威”都不在话下，都可以打倒，而且一定能够打倒！从此，学生们更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作。
    经过这次辩论，学生们认识到：阶级斗争是长期的复杂的，懂得了要用阶级观点去分析和处理一切问题，才能抓到事物的本质，而不致被复杂的假象所迷惑。
    在“三家村”黑店的反党反社会主义阴谋大暴露之后，这个班的学生进一步认识了吴晗的丑恶面目，深入批判“三家村”黑帮的罪恶活动。他们说，我们就要毕业了，我们不但要接过锤子、榔头、锄头、枪杆，同时也要把过去为资产阶级“权威”垄断的文化、学术阵地夺过来，锄掉毒草，消灭黑帮！
