    The Deng Tuo Gang Must Be Made to Bleed!

    After reading the materials in the newspaper exposing Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist sinister language, I was extremely angry. Deng Tuo launched a vicious and comprehensive attack on our great Party, great socialism, and the great General Line. We absolutely cannot tolerate this. Poisonous weeds can never become fragrant flowers. We must resolutely and thoroughly uproot all poisonous weeds like Deng Tuo and use them as fertilizer in the fields.

    Deng Tuo slandered our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "talking big," and "bashing one's head against a brick wall in the face of reality." I have been participating in the socialist construction of the motherland all along. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 has always inspired me to move forward, and I am qualified to speak. Take our Shuangshui Commune in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, for example. Before the Great Leap Forward in 1958, there were no tractors or electric irrigation and drainage here. Farming relied on the weather. In 1958, under the brilliant encouragement of the General Line of "Going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the commune members of the entire commune displayed soaring enthusiasm. In just eight months, they built a huge reservoir and laid two underground water pipes more than 200 meters long through the seabed, capable of irrigating 60,000 mu of paddy fields. The entire commune realized water conservancy, changed the natural landscape, and broke the situation of drought in the mountains, flooding in the paddy fields, and very low yields for thousands of years. Even in the unprecedented severe drought of over three months without a single drop of rain, our commune achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, becoming a commune with a yield of a thousand catties of grain per mu. Now, we have more than twenty electric irrigation and drainage stations and twelve tractors. All areas that can be cultivated by machinery have implemented mechanized farming. These are all products of the Great Leap Forward, all achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and all undeniable facts! These facts exist all over the country. Why don't you open your eyes and see, Deng Tuo! In the face of these facts, it is you who are "bashing your head against a brick wall"!

    Chairman Mao taught us: "In class society, everyone lives in a definite class position, and all kinds of thinking are stamped with the brand of a class." What tree blooms what flower, what vine bears what fruit, what position speaks what words. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries viciously attack our Great Leap Forward, domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists oppose our Great Leap Forward, and Deng Tuo and his small clique also slander our Great Leap Forward. They are all in the same gang, all wanting to use various opportunities to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, seize the people's power, and let capitalism be restored in our country.

    We are the proletariat, and the proletariat is a born offensive class. We will always be at the forefront of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and anti-feudal exploitation. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our great benefactors and saviors, leading us to hold high the great red banner of the General Line and march towards socialism and communism. We will always listen to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao, follow the Communist Party, and shout long live the General Line, long live the Great Leap Forward, long live the People's Commune.

    Now, Deng Tuo's fox tail has been dragged out. We must grab it and never let go, fight to the end.

    邓拓黑帮一定要碰得头破血流
    广东省新会县双水供销社基背供销店　杜龙
    看了报纸上揭露邓拓反党反社会主义黑话的材料以后，我非常愤怒。邓拓对我们伟大的党、伟大的社会主义、伟大的总路线进行了恶毒全面的攻击，我们绝不能容忍。毒草永远不能变香花。我们必须坚决彻底把所有象邓拓这样的毒草拔掉，下田当肥料用。
    邓拓诬蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，“在实际的事物面前碰得头破血流”。我一直参加祖国的社会主义建设，一九五八年大跃进一直鼓舞着我前进，我有资格说话。就说我们广东省新会县双水公社，一九五八年大跃进以前，这里没有拖拉机，没有电动排灌，种田要靠天收。一九五八年，全公社的社员在“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的光辉鼓舞下，发扬了冲天干劲，只用了八个月的时间，就修建了一个规模巨大的水库，铺设了两条二百多米长通过海底的地下水管道，能灌溉六万亩水田。全公社实现了水利化，改变了自然面貌，打破了几千年来山地受旱，水田受涝，产量很低的局面。即使在三个多月没下一滴雨的百年未遇的大旱之年，我们公社也获得了全面大丰收，成为亩产粮食千斤的公社。现在，我们有了二十多个电力排灌站，有了十二台拖拉机，凡是能够机耕的地区，都实行了机耕。这些都是大跃进的产物，都是大跃进的成绩，都是千真万确的事实！这些事实全国各地都有，邓拓你为什么不睁眼看看！在这些事实面前，“碰得头破血流”的正是你！
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”什么树开什么花，什么蔓结什么瓜，什么立场就说什么话。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派恶毒攻击我们的大跃进，国内的地富反坏右反对我们的大跃进，邓拓这一小撮人也诬蔑我们的大跃进，他们都是同伙，都想利用各种时机反党反社会主义，夺取人民政权，让资本主义在我国复辟。
    我们是无产阶级，无产阶级是天生的进攻阶级。我们永远走在反帝反修反封建剥削的最前列。共产党、毛主席是我们的大恩人、大救星，领导我们高举总路线的伟大红旗，走向社会主义、共产主义。我们永远听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走，跟共产党走，高呼总路线万岁，大跃进万岁，人民公社万岁。
    现在，邓拓的狐狸尾巴已经揪出来了。我们一定要揪住不放，斗争到底。
