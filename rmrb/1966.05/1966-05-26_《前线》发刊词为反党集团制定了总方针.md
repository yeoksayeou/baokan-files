    "Standing at the Forefront of Revolution and Construction" was the title of the inaugural editorial of "Qianxian," published on November 25, 1958. According to "Qianxian"'s explanation, standing at the forefront of revolution and construction meant "standing at the forefront of implementing the Party's guidelines, policies, and other central directives; standing at the forefront of the socialist revolution; standing at the forefront of socialist construction; standing at the forefront of the struggle of Marxism-Leninism; standing at the forefront of the struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism; standing at the forefront of the struggle against all kinds of unhealthy trends and evil practices within the people." The wording is grand and seems very revolutionary. However, looking at the entire text, this inaugural editorial makes no discussion of major issues such as implementing the Party's guidelines and policies or socialist construction. It does not make any criticism of bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism. The target of its spear is not the class enemy, but our people. It uses a large amount of space to viciously concentrate fire on the so-called "unhealthy trends and evil practices within the people," attacking our great leader and the great Party with deep-seated hatred. That is to say, it wants to stand at the forefront of anti-Party and anti-socialism, thereby determining the main direction of attack for the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique and formulating the general line of anti-Party and anti-socialism for the "Three-Family Village" group.

    The "Inaugural Editorial" mentions the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves in passing; while regarding the "not very good tendencies" in the so-called "ideological style of Party members" and "ideological style of the Party," it talks about them all the time, seizes on them and refuses to let go; and it is determined to "continue to expose and criticize them."

    The "Inaugural Editorial" uses the most vicious language to distort and uglify our Party members and Party organizations. It attacks us as "mediocrities," "pleasing all sides" "between right and wrong"; in the face of "major issues of right and wrong," it accuses us of adopting a "non-biased" and "detached" attitude with "sleek cunning," slandering us as "not caring about the interests and success or failure of the Party and the people, but rather establishing popularity without principle, striving for 'votes'," and being infected with a "'petty bourgeois' and 'hypocritical villager'" style. It is very obvious that the inaugural editorial is using opposition to "mediocrity" to smear comrades who resolutely act in accordance with the Party's instructions! When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party in 1957, weren't those rightist elements also smearing comrades who listened to the Party as "yes-men and mediocre"? Weren't they also full of hatred? Comrades, please think about it: who else besides the class enemy would uglify our Party like this. Comrades, please also think about it: which of our representatives is "establishing popularity without principle" and "striving for votes"? This is the greatest libel against the representatives to the Party Congress and the representatives to the People's Congresses at all levels! It is the greatest libel against the socialist election system! The "Inaugural Editorial" is truly vicious to the extreme, and clear-sighted people can easily see that Deng Tuo's smearing of our Party as "going back on its word," "capricious," "going mad," and "going crazy," etc., is precisely implementing this general line.

    The "Inaugural Editorial" curses our Party leadership for "standing above the masses, appearing to be the masters of the world, and presumptuously judging the mass movement." It fiercely scolds our Party leadership for "seeming to be a carefully calculating and commanding Kongming," and intimidates and threatens our Party in every way, saying that if this ideological style spreads in the Party, it will become like an old man with too much limestone in his body, not only unable to leap forward, but even having difficulty walking and slow action. "Carefully calculating and commanding Kongming," "appearing to be the masters of the world," etc., who does this refer to? Obviously, this refers to our Party leadership. Aren't the poisonous arrows shot by Deng Tuo, "Three Kinds of Zhuge Liang" and "Is Wisdom Reliable?", using the same kind of innuendo to viciously attack and slander our Party leadership? Deng Tuo smeared our Party leadership as "Zhuge Liang with juice" and threatened that "impersonating Zhuge Liang and pretending to be Zhuge Liang" will one day "reveal their true colors." Please compare, comrades, how similar Deng Tuo's language is to the language of the "Inaugural Editorial"!

    The "Inaugural Editorial" slanders our Great Leap Forward as "acting emotionally," "acting on momentary 'instinct'," "acting according to fragmented materials and superficial phenomena," and "drifting with the wind like kites and hydrogen balloons, that is, acting according to the air." In short, it is "violating objective laws and arbitrarily messing around." It is very obvious that here it is using what is called "not being able to violate objective laws" to attack the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward, to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialism. This is exactly the same as Deng Tuo's slander of our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "talking big," and "bumping their heads and bleeding."

    The "Inaugural Editorial" also distorts Chairman Mao's scientific thesis that "the people are the creators of history" with ulterior motives. Chairman Mao clearly taught us: "The people, and only the people, are the driving force in the making of world history." But the "Inaugural Editorial" promotes "man is the creator of history," deliberately changing "the people" to "man." In the "Party's theoretical journal," openly tampering with Chairman Mao's teachings is by no means a momentary oversight. The essence of this fallacy is to sing the praises of the reactionary ruling classes of past generations and to promote capitalism. Among the poisonous arrows launched by the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique, some greatly publicized the "benevolent rule" of emperors, generals, and ministers of past dynasties, isn't that also implementing this general line!

    It should be especially pointed out that the "Inaugural Editorial" repeatedly emphasized "the present" and "reality" from beginning to end. What does "the present" and "reality" refer to? At that time, the people of the whole country were, under the guidance of the Party's General Line, full of spirit and high fighting will, realizing the Great Leap Forward in all aspects and happily realizing the People's Communes. But the "Qianxian" Inaugural Editorial said that it must "continuously conduct systematic and thorough investigation and research on the current specific situation. Without a scientific understanding of reality, we have no basis for determining guidelines and policies and establishing determination and confidence, and our guiding work has no basis." The "Inaugural Editorial" was obviously very dissatisfied with the Party's General Line and the reality of the Great Leap Forward and the People's Communes, slandering our Party's line, guidelines, and policies as "not having a scientific understanding of reality" and having no basis, which also formulated the general line for the "Three-Family Village" group to oppose the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

    It is no accident that "Qianxian" became a tool of anti-Party and anti-socialism. Its anti-Party and anti-socialist general line was set in the inaugural editorial long ago. The "Inaugural Editorial" determined the business policy for the "Three-Family Village" black shop.

    We are determined to eradicate all monsters and demons, no matter what "master" or what "authority" you are, no matter how famous or how high your position is, and even more no matter what coat you wear or what banner you wave, as long as you are anti-Party and anti-socialist, as long as you oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will never let you go! We will never give up until we win a complete victory.

    《前线》发刊词为反党集团制定了总方针
    彭尔琨　纪钢
    “站在革命和建设的最前线”，这是一九五八年十一月二十五日创刊的《前线》发刊词的题目。按照《前线》的解释，所谓站在革命和建设的最前线，是“站在贯彻执行党的方针、政策和中央其他指示的最前线，站在社会主义革命的最前线，站在社会主义建设的最前线，站在马列主义思想斗争的最前线，站在反对各色各样的资产阶级思想和现代修正主义斗争的最前线，站在反对人民内部各种歪风、邪气斗争的最前线”。词句堂而皇之，好象十分革命，然而从全文来看，这个发刊词，对于贯彻执行党的方针政策，对于社会主义建设等重大问题丝毫没有论述，对于资产阶级思想和现代修正主义没有作任何批判，它矛头所向，不是阶级敌人，而是我们人民内部，它用大量篇幅，恶毒地向所谓“人民内部各种歪风、邪气”集中开火，带着刻骨的仇恨，攻击我们伟大的领袖和伟大的党。这就是说，它要站在反党反社会主义的最前线，从而为“三家村”反党集团确定了主攻方向，为“三家村”集团制定了反党反社会主义的总方针。
    “发刊词”对于敌我矛盾一提而过；而对于所谓“党员的思想作风”“党的思想作风”中“很不好的倾向”，却通篇皆是，抓住不放；并下定决心“必须继续不断地加以揭露和批判”。
    “发刊词”用最恶毒的语言，极力歪曲和丑化我们的党员和党组织。攻击我们是“中庸主义者”，“在是非之间”“八面讨好”；在“大是大非面前”“贼光油滑”地采取“不偏不倚”的“折衷”“超然”态度，污蔑我们“不辨是非、不分敌我”，“最关心的，不是什么党和人民的利益和事业的成败，而是无原则的树立人缘，争取‘选票’”，染上了“‘市侩’、‘乡愿’作风”。非常明显，发刊词是借反对“中庸主义”来污蔑坚决遵照党的指示办事的同志！一九五七年资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，那些右派分子不是也污蔑听党的话的同志是“唯唯诺诺、庸庸碌碌”吗？不是也仇恨万分吗？同志们请想一想：除了阶级敌人，还有谁这样丑化我们的党。同志们还请想一想：我们的代表有哪一个是“无原则的树立人缘”“争取选票”的？这是对党代表大会的代表、各级人民代表大会的代表的最大诽谤！是对社会主义选举制度的最大诽谤！“发刊词”真是恶毒透顶，而明眼人不难看出，邓拓污蔑我们党“自食其言”、“喜怒无常”、“发疯”、“发狂”，等等，正是执行这个总方针的。
    “发刊词”咒骂我们党的领导“站在群众之上，俨然以世界主宰自居，对群众运动妄自尊大地进行审判”。大骂我们党的领导“好象是深谋熟算，指挥若定的孔明”，并对我们党百般恫吓和威胁说，如果让这种思想作风在党内蔓延起来，就会变得象体内石灰质过多的老人一样，不但跃进不起来，甚至步履艰难，行动都会迟滞起来。“深谋熟算，指挥若定的孔明”，“俨然以世界主宰自居”等等，这是指谁呢？很明显，这是指我们党的领导。邓拓射出的毒箭《三种诸葛亮》、《智谋是可靠的吗？》不是同样使用这样的黑话，恶毒地攻击和污蔑我们党的领导吗？邓拓污蔑我们党的领导是“带汁的诸葛亮”，并威胁说“冒充诸葛亮，假装诸葛亮”总会有一天“要原形毕露”。请同志们比较一下，邓拓的语言和“发刊词”的语言是多么一样！
    “发刊词”污蔑我们大跃进是“感情用事”，是“凭灵机一动的‘本能’办事”，是“按照片断的材料和表面现象办事”，“象风筝、氢气球一样，随风飘荡，即跟着空气办事”。总之是“违背客观规律，任意乱干”。非常明显，这里是假借甚么“不能违背客观规律”来攻击党的总路线、大跃进，来进行反党反社会主义。这同邓拓污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，“碰得头破血流”，真是如出一辙。
    “发刊词”还别有用心地歪曲毛主席关于“人民是历史的创造者”的科学论断。毛主席明明教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”而“发刊词”却宣扬“人是历史的创造者”，故意把“人民”改为“人”。在“党的理论刊物”上，公然篡改毛主席的教导，这决不是甚么一时的疏忽。这种谬论实质上是为历代反动统治阶级唱颂歌，是为资本主义张目的货色。“三家村”反党集团发射的毒箭中，有些大肆宣扬历代帝王将相的“德政”，不也正是执行着这个总方针么！
    应该特别指出的是，“发刊词”从头到尾反复强调了“当前”和“现实”。“当前”和“现实”是指什么呢？在当时，全国人民正在党的总路线指引下，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在各方面实现着大跃进，欢天喜地地实现人民公社化。而《前线》发刊词却说什么必须“对于当前的具体情况，连续地进行系统周密的调查研究。没有对于现实的科学认识，我们就没有确定方针、政策和树立决心、信心的根据，我们的指导工作也就无所根据”。对于党的总路线，对于大跃进、人民公社化的现实，“发刊词”显然十分不满，污蔑我们党的路线、方针、政策是“没有对于现实的科学认识”、没有根据的，这也就为“三家村”集团反对党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社，制定了总方针。
    《前线》成为反党反社会主义的工具并不是偶然的，它的反党反社会主义的总方针，早在发刊词中就定好了，“发刊词”为“三家村”黑店确定了经营方针。
    我们决心要铲除一切牛鬼蛇神，不管你是什么“大师”，什么“权威”，不管你多么有名，多么有地位，更不管你披着什么外衣，打着什么旗号，只要反党反社会主义，只要反对毛泽东思想，我们就决不会放过你们！不获全胜，决不罢休。
