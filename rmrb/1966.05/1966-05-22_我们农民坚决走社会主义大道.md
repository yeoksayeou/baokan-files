    We Peasants Firmly Take the Socialist Road
    The socialist road is the only road to happiness for us peasants. We will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and will never be fooled by the likes of Deng Tuo.
    Zeng Guangfu, Delegate to the National People's Congress, National Model Agricultural Laborer, Secretary of the Party Branch of Dongduzhuang Brigade, Xin County, Shandong.
    Deng Tuo, your anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk makes me extremely angry. You want to spread rumors to confuse the masses, but you won't succeed. We peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never be fooled or deceived by you. We will never forget the Communist Party after our liberation, and we will never forget Chairman Mao when we are happy. The whole country sings the praises of socialism.
    Take our brigade's situation as an example! Before liberation, this was a low-lying alkaline land, either flooded or drought-stricken, with very little harvest. The reactionary government's exorbitant taxes, levies, and extortion, and the landlords' cruel oppression and exploitation, made the peasants live a life worse than that of beasts of burden. In 1942, there was a famine, and eighteen households, seventy-eight people, from our village went out to beg for food, and six households sold their children. Dong Huaiyu's family of five starved to death four of them. However, after liberation, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, especially after the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958, our brigade has become a solid and unbreakable collective family. Open your eyes and look at the tremendous changes in our brigade: before liberation, the yield per mu was less than one hundred jin, but in 1958 it reached more than three hundred jin. From 1959 to 1965, we suffered severe droughts and floods for seven consecutive years, but because the broad masses of commune members studied Chairman Mao's works, established the idea of farming for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the revolution, and mustered soaring enthusiasm, we still reaped bumper harvests year after year. In 1965, the yield per mu reached more than four hundred jin, and ginned cotton reached seventy jin. In addition to distribution and accumulation, we sold more than 78,000 jin of grain and 63,000 jin of cotton to the state, powerfully supporting socialist construction and the world people's revolution. Before liberation, the masses had little to eat and wear, but last year each person was allocated nearly four hundred jin of grain and more than fifty yuan, and more than three hundred pigs were raised. Commune members have housing, food, clothing, and money to spend.
    These living facts fully prove the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and the socialist road is the only road to happiness for us peasants. We peasants love the Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism most. Deng Tuo, open your eyes and look at our brigade. Is the socialist construction undertaking "finished"? Is "fantasy replacing reality"? Is "the entire fortune of an egg" "completely destroyed"? The peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have bright eyes and high awareness. No matter what tricks you play, you can't deceive us. No matter how rampant you demons and monsters are, you can't shake our determination to take the socialist road. We peasants will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and resolutely follow the broad road of socialism and communism.

    我们农民坚决走社会主义大道
    社会主义道路是我们农民唯一的幸福道路，我们坚决听毛主席的话，绝不会上邓拓之流的当
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国农业劳动模范山东莘县董杜庄大队党支部书记  曾广福
    邓拓，你们的反党反社会主义的黑话，使我万分气愤。你想造谣惑众是办不到的，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民绝不会上你的当，受你的骗。翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席，全国人民齐唱社会主义好。
    就拿俺队的情况来说吧！解放前，这里是一片涝洼碱地，不是淹就是旱，收成很少。反动政府的苛捐杂税、敲诈勒索，地主的残酷压迫剥削，使农民过着牛马不如的生活。一九四二年遭灾荒，俺村出外逃荒要饭的就有十八户、七十八人，卖儿卖女的就有六户。董怀玉全家五口人就活活地饿死了四口。可是，解放后，在党中央和毛主席的英明正确领导下，特别是一九五八年成立人民公社以后，我们大队已成了风吹不动、坚如磐石的集体大家庭了。你睁开眼睛看看俺队的巨变吧：解放前亩产不到一百斤，一九五八年达到三百多斤。从一九五九年到一九六五年，连续七年遭受严重的旱涝灾害，但由于广大社员学习了毛主席著作，树立了种田为革命、一心为革命的思想，鼓起了冲天干劲，仍然连年获得丰收。一九六五年亩产达到四百多斤，皮棉七十斤。除分配和积累以外，交售给国家粮食七万八千多斤，棉花六万三千斤，有力地支援了社会主义建设和世界人民革命。解放前群众少吃缺穿，而去年每人分配粮食近四百斤，款五十多元，养猪三百多头，社员有住有吃有穿有钱花。
    这些活生生的事实，充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，社会主义道路是我们农民唯一幸福的道路。我们农民最热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义。邓拓，你睁开眼睛看看俺这个队，是社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了吗？是“空想代替了现实”吗？是“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”吗？用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民，眼睛是亮的，觉悟是高的，不管你耍什么手段，也骗不了我们。不管你们这些牛鬼蛇神多么嚣张，也动摇不了我们走社会主义道路的决心。我们农民永远听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，按毛主席的指示办事，坚决地沿着社会主义、共产主义的康庄大道走下去。
