    Please Look at the Reactionary True Face of "Three-Family Village"
    Editor: Bao Weiwen, Wu Ying, Zhong Hua
    Foreword
    The anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist face of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha's "Three-Family Village" has been exposed to the light of day. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the articles by comrades Yao Wenyuan, Gao Ju, and He Ming have launched righteous and stern criticisms of "Three-Family Village." To help the broad readership further understand the reactionary face of "Three-Family Village," we have specially excerpted and arranged for public display the large number of poisonous arrows shot from "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three-Family Village Notes." To facilitate reading, we have added some annotations in some places.
    Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" consists of one hundred and fifty-three articles, with one hundred and fifty-two articles published in the "Beijing Evening News" from March 1961 to September 1962. Of these, one hundred and fifty articles were published in five volumes by Beijing Publishing House. The other three articles: "The Case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng," "A Pigeon is Called a Pigeon," and "This Year's Spring Festival," were not included in the collection because the author had a guilty conscience. "Three-Family Village Notes" was published in the "Frontline" magazine from October 1961 to July 1964, with a total of sixty-seven articles, signed Wu Nanxing. Wu is Wu Han, Nan is Ma Nancun, i.e., Deng Tuo, and Xing is Fanxing, i.e., Liao Mosha.
    "Yanshan Night Talks," "Three-Family Village Notes," and "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are all of the same vein, running through a black line of anti-Party, anti-socialist sentiment. This black line echoed the anti-China chorus of international imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries at that time, echoed the restoration activities of domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and blatantly launched a frenzied attack on the Party together with right-leaning opportunists, attempting to change the color of our great motherland.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionary things, if you don't hit them, they won't fall." Now, a socialist cultural revolution of great historical significance is rising. In this great struggle, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit, and are determined to thoroughly destroy the big black den of "Three-Family Village," to overthrow all demons and monsters, and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end!
    Abstract of Reactionary Content of "Yanshan Night Talks"
  (I) Viciously attacking our great Party, attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, attacking the Party's General Line
  1. Attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat, falsely accusing the Party and the state of "official corruption that has become increasingly decadent," falsely accusing our struggle against right-leaning opportunists as "expansion and complication"; nonsensically saying that "rule of virtue" is better than "rule of force," scolding our great Party for "wanting to be a hegemon," "making enemies everywhere," and "losing popular support"
   "Recently, I accidentally read Wei Tai's 'Dongxuan Notes' from the Song Dynasty,... some historical anecdotes are very interesting and can open up people's minds. For example, the book records the case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng, which is one example."
    "Chen Jiang was in Fujian, and it is said that he was corrupt and notorious. The Empress Dowager Mingsu, who was in court at the time, discovered his illegal activities and questioned Prime Minister Wang Yigong. This prime minister repeatedly dodged and evaded, and finally reluctantly adopted a perfunctory attitude, resulting in one mistake after another, fully exposing that he had neither the wisdom to recognize talent nor the ability to foresee events."
    "After Wang Geng (note: the official sent by the prime minister to thoroughly investigate the Chen Jiang case) arrived in Fujian, he rashly announced dozens of crimes of Chen Jiang. However, after verifying the facts one by one, it was found that these dozens of items were deliberately exaggerated and fabricated, and the yamen school also revealed that Wang Geng's son had accepted bribes. This news quickly spread to the capital, and the Empress Dowager Mingsu was furious and ordered Wang Geng to be put in jail as well. As a result, this case was further expanded in scope and complicated in content." (Note: Readers should note that Deng Tuo is using insinuation to viciously attack the Party!)
      "Readers of history, as long as they analyze the main plot of this case carefully with a calm and objective attitude, it is not difficult to find that there is an important reason for its expansion and complication, that is, during the reign of Empress Dowager Mingsu in the Song Dynasty, official corruption had become increasingly decadent. The superiors did not have capable and responsible prime ministers and their staff to employ and administer; the local officials below acted arbitrarily, actually forming a situation where the tail could not be wagged."
  (Note: Look, Deng Tuo is pointing at the mulberry tree and scolding the locust tree, attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat!)
          ("The Case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng," "Beijing Evening News" June 22, 1961)
      "Then, according to our current viewpoint, in our language, what exactly is the rule of virtue and what is the rule of force? The so-called rule of virtue can be explained as the mass line of thinking and working style that honestly starts from reality; and the so-called rule of force can also be explained as the subjective and arbitrary thinking and working style that shouts and yells. However, this explanation cannot be imposed on the ancients, and it is not realistic to comment on the ancients from this point of view."
      "But in any case, from ancient history, people can also easily find experiences and lessons that show that even in ancient times, the rule of virtue was still much better than the rule of force. Ban Gu, the author of 'Han Shu,' recalled the situation of the princes vying for hegemony before the Qin and Han dynasties, and satirized the rule of force in several places. ... This makes people feel at a glance that those who wanted to be hegemons at that time made enemies everywhere and were so unpopular!" (Note: Is this any different from Khrushchev's revisionist curse that we are "hegemonists"!)	(Fourth Collection: "Rule of Virtue and Rule of Force," February 25, 1962.

    2. Falsely accusing and cursing our Party's leadership of "loving to speak big words," being "liars who brag"; "showing off their abilities," "being self-righteous," "will eventually suffer a big loss one day"
      "Wang Chong pointed out in 'Lunheng': 'The words of the Confucians are exaggerated and exceed reality.' His meaning is obviously that literati often love to speak big words. In fact, there are all kinds of people who love to speak big words, not just literati."
      "Although there are many true stories of speaking big words in history, these fabricated stories are more general. They concentrate various tricks of speaking big words in typical storylines, which are more noticeable and increase vigilance, and thus are more educational."
          (Fifth Collection: "Stories of Speaking Big Words," June 11, 1961)
    "The facts clearly prove that those who speak big words can only brag, and can never take action. Even today, such bragging figures can be met anytime, anywhere. Among them, the size of the bragging may be different, but the fact that they are bragging is the same."
    "The Machists thought that they could do whatever they wanted with the effect of their psychological elements, but the result was only that they would be battered and bloody in the face of actual things, and eventually they would have to declare the bankruptcy of the Machists." (Note: The original text published in "Beijing Evening News" was: "The Machists thought that they could overcome any difficulties with the effect of their psychological elements, but the result was that the difficulties not only would not be overcome, but would become more and more numerous, and their severity would increase day by day, and eventually they would have to declare the bankruptcy of the Machists." Mach is a subjective idealist, and Deng Tuo actually falsely accused our great Party of being Machists, and vainly hoped that the construction of our great motherland would be declared bankrupt. His malicious intentions are obvious.)
    "After the titmouse's cowhide was blown, it only flew away shyly, which of course was lucky; it should be seen that in other cases, after the cowhide has been blown, the deceived people will never easily let go of the bragging liar."
      (Fifth Collection: "Two Foreign Fables," November 26, 1961)
    "Zheng Xing, a famous scholar during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, also advised Liu Xiu to 'extensively collect and seek advice, and accept the plans of the subordinates.' Fan Yaofu, the son of Fan Zhongyan of the Song Dynasty, once advised Sima Guang, saying: 'I hope that you will humbly listen to the opinions of the public, and do not necessarily come up with your own plans. If you come up with your own plans, then sycophants will take the opportunity to cater to you.' These views of the ancients are very good. Especially Fan Yaofu's saying 'do not necessarily come up with your own plans' is especially worth noting. Some people often like to show off their abilities, be self-righteous, look down on the masses, and always want to come up with their own ideas, trying to win by surprise, without accepting the good opinions of the people below. People with this problem, if they do not realize it themselves, and do not correct this problem, will eventually suffer a big loss one day."
     (Fourth Collection: "Is Wisdom Reliable?" February 22, 1962)
      3. Madly opposing the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, falsely accusing our Party of "replacing reality with fantasies," hitting "an egg's worth of family property" "to nothing"; viciously slandering our Party for not understanding how to "cherish labor power"
    "We usually say that someone has family property, which means that he has a lot of wealth, but we would not believe that an egg can be considered family property!"
    "During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, there was a novelist named Jiang Yingke. He wrote a book called 'Xuetao Novel,' which has a story that says: 'A city dweller was very poor and could not plan for the evening in the morning. One day, he picked up a chicken egg and happily told his wife: I have family property. His wife asked where it was? He held up the egg to show her and said: This is it, but it will take ten years for the family property to be ready. So he discussed with his wife, saying: I will take this egg and borrow a neighbor's hen to incubate it. When the chicks hatch, I will take one female one and bring it home to lay eggs. I can get fifteen chickens a month. Within two years, the chickens will lay chickens again, and I can get three hundred chickens, which are worth ten gold. I will use ten gold to exchange for five cows, and the cows will give birth to cows again. In three years, I can get twenty-five cows. The cows that are born will give birth to cows again, and in three years, I can get one hundred and fifty cows, which are worth three hundred gold. I will use this gold to borrow money, and in three years, I can get half a thousand gold."
      "Don't you think this story can explain many problems? This miser also knows that the accumulation of family property takes a lot of time. Therefore, he calculated with his wife that it would take ten years to earn this family property. This seems reasonable. However, his plan has no reliable basis at all, and is completely based on a hypothesis, with each step premised on the result of the previous hypothesis. For things ten years later, he replaced reality with fantasies, fully showing the true colors of a miser, which aroused his wife's anger, and she knocked his family property to nothing with one punch." (Note: Deng Tuo here is extremely hostile to the great revolutionary spirit of our people of self-reliance and hard struggle to change the poor and blank appearance of our country, and viciously curses us for "replacing reality with fantasies.")
        (First Collection: "An Egg's Worth of Family Property," June 15, 1961)
    "As early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and before, many ancient great politicians already knew the importance of cherishing labor power. ... Through their own ruling experience, they also discovered the so-called 'limit' of 'using the people's power,' which is actually the discovery of certain objective laws of the growth and decline of labor power."
    "'Book of Rites,' 'Wang Zhi Pian' wrote: 'When using the people's power, it should not exceed three days a year.' ... In fact, to explain it in modern terms, this refers to the labor power used for various basic constructions. According to the level of productivity of society at that time, the ancients stipulated that the labor power used for various basic constructions could only account for about one percent of the total labor power. Now it seems that this ratio is appropriate for ancient countries that take agricultural production as the foundation."
    "'Zhou Li' also records: 'Three days in a good year, two days in a medium year, and only one day in a year without harvest.' That is to say, in a good year, the labor power occupied by basic construction can reach about one percent of the total labor power; in a normal medium year, it can only occupy about zero point six percent; and in a famine year with no harvest, it can at most occupy about zero point three percent."
    "We should get new inspiration from the experience of the ancients, and pay more attention to cherishing labor power in all aspects," "There are many things that must be estimated whether one's ability is competent, and one must never be too reluctant." (Note: 'Book of Rites' is an ancient book that records the landlord class's etiquette, and Deng Tuo is saying here, look, the landlord is so cherish the "people's power"! We want our proletariat to get "new inspiration" from it. Is this not slander of our Party for not cherishing labor power!)
      (First Collection: "The Theory of Cherishing Labor Power," April 30, 1961)
     4. Extremely hostile to the great development of socialist cause, clamoring for "thawing," cursing not being willing to "let go" is equivalent to blindness, advocating "letting go is solid ground," wanting us to let go and not make revolution
      "The cold season brought by the north wind is about to end, and it will be replaced by the warm east wind, and the earth will soon thaw,..." (Note: "Thawing" is a counter-revolutionary language used by the Khrushchev revisionist group when opposing Stalin. In the view of the people of "Three-Family Village," "thawing" means that the time for the restoration of capitalist and feudal forces has come.)
          ("This Year's Spring Festival," "Beijing Evening News" February 4, 1962)
    "These days, I was sorting out old books and accidentally took out Liu Yuanqing's 'Yingxie Record' from the Ming Dynasty, and read a passage in it:
    'There was a blind man passing over a dry stream bridge, fell and grabbed the balustrade with both hands, holding it firmly, thinking that if he lost his hand, he would fall into the abyss. A passerby told him: Don't be afraid, just let go and it's solid ground. The blind man didn't believe it, and held the balustrade and cried for a long time. After a long time, his hands were tired, and he lost his hand and fell to the ground. So he ridiculed himself and said: Hey, if I had known it was solid ground earlier, why would I have suffered for so long?'"
    "After reading this little story, I found it very enlightening. Some people are not blind themselves, but they usually behave like the blind man in this story when they encounter certain things. (Note: This is a vicious attack on revolutionary people!) Why is this? The fundamental reason is that they do not understand the actual situation, and they have no idea in their minds, so they are not sure when they encounter things, and they do not know what to do."
      "When encountering things, there is no need to be afraid at all. Don't be like the blind man in this story, afraid of falling into the abyss, desperately grabbing the bridge balustrade and not letting go; just let go boldly, knowing that 'letting go is solid ground,' what is there to be afraid of?" (Note: The so-called "letting go" is to want us to dismount, to want us not to make revolution!)
      "Sometimes, when doing something, because the investigation and research work is not done enough, I always feel that I have a certain degree of blindness. Even the surrounding masses have put forward some useful opinions and reflected some correct situations, but because I have no idea in my mind, I can't judge whether these opinions and situations are correct or not. ... When the facts are completely clear, some problems have already passed, and I feel very annoyed in my heart. This is just like what the blind man said, if I had known that letting go is solid ground earlier, why would I have suffered so much?"
          (Third Collection: "'Letting Go is Solid Ground'," November 5, 1961)
     5. Using Li Sancai and Mi Wanzhong of the Ming Dynasty to "resign" and "be dismissed from office" to call for grievances for right-leaning opportunists who have been dismissed from office, wanting to "write biographies separately" for them; at the same time, styling oneself as a political opposition, attacking our Party for "one-sidedly emphasizing politics" is "extremely wrong"
    "He (note: referring to Li Sancai) opposed the method of collecting mining taxes at that time and actively supported the Donglin Party members." "Because many memorials were fruitless, Li Sancai once requested to resign and go home, but many court officials submitted memorials to retain him."
    "Of course, at that time, there also appeared 'Donglin Party members' (note: the Donglin Party was a landlord class opposition party composed of unofficial bureaucratic politicians in the Ming Dynasty.) who attacked the dark feudal politics, and 'Sancai and Shenxiangjie'. Therefore, at that time, there was a group of stubborn and corrupt forces who tried their best to attack Gu Xiancheng, Gao Panlong, and other Donglin Party members, and also tried their best to attack Li Sancai. Later, Wei Zhongxian's gang regarded Li Sancai and the Donglin Party members as irreconcilable enemies, which is not surprising at all."
      "Even after Li Sancai finally retired to his hometown, they still wanted to add the charges of 'stealing imperial wood to build private residences' and other crimes to Li Sancai's body. ... Li Sancai repeatedly submitted memorials, 'requesting the dispatch of middle officials to investigate,' 'requesting the joint investigation of the ministers,' 'requesting the emperor to personally investigate'. It seems that he was justified, but the court of Wanli dared not thoroughly investigate this fact. What is the truth of the matter? Isn't this very clear?"
       (Fifth Collection: "Defending Li Sancai," March 29, 1962)
      "Mi Wanzhong was a very knowledgeable and principled person. ... It is said that Mi Wanzhong was honest and upright in politics, cared about civil and criminal affairs and cultural and educational undertakings, and was praised by the middle and lower-level people and literati wherever he went."
      "Because Mi Wanzhong usually despised Wei Zhongxian and his gang and repeatedly commented on current affairs, he became a thorn in Wei Zhongxian's side. In particular, Wei Zhongxian's lackey Ni Wenhuan tried his best to frame good people. At that time, dozens of people were framed by him. Those who were seriously framed were tortured to death, and those who were lightly framed were dismissed from office. Mi Wanzhong was also subjected to the punishment of being dismissed from office."
      "In the past, when local areas edited local chronicles, they routinely submitted a list of so-called 'local sages,' and then collected materials and wrote biographies separately. If we want to edit the Beijing Chronicle now, then we should obviously consider giving appropriate positions to Wanping Da Xiaomi (note: referring to the Ming Dynasty bureaucrat Mi Wanzhong and the early Qing Dynasty bureaucrat Mi Hanwen.)"
          (Third Collection: "Wanping Da Xiaomi," November 9, 1961)
    "'Wind sound, rain sound, reading sound, every sound enters the ear;
    Family affairs, state affairs, world affairs, every affair is concerned.'
    This is a couplet written by Gu Xiancheng, the leader of the Donglin Party in the Ming Dynasty."
      "The meaning of the first line is that the environment of the academy is conducive for people to concentrate on reading. These eleven words vividly depict the scene of the wind and rain sounds of nature intertwined with the reading sounds of people, making people feel as if they are in the Donglin Academy of that year, and their ears seem to really hear a piece of recitation and lecturing sound, resonating with the sounds of nature."
    "The meaning of the second line is that people who read in the academy should care about politics. These eleven words fully show the political ambitions of the Donglin Party members at that time. They advocated that they should not only care about their own family affairs, but also care about the major affairs of the country and the world." (Note: The political ambition of the Donglin Party was to replace the central government at that time. Look, how big is the political ambition of "Three-Family Village"!)
      "It is extremely wrong to one-sidedly emphasize reading without caring about politics; or to one-sidedly emphasize politics without striving to read. People who talk about politics without reading are just empty politicians, not real politicians."
          (Second Collection: "Every Affair is Concerned," October 5, 1961)
     6. In the same tone as Khrushchev revisionism, frantically cursing our great Party as a "conceited" "madman," who "doesn't understand even the most basic knowledge," and "thinks that it is no longer necessary to ask teachers from now on," "cannot humbly unite with people who are stronger than oneself"
      "Any madman who wants to learn everything at once will definitely suffer a big loss."
    "The most important joint for a beginner is when they have just learned one, two, three or foreign language A, B, C, etc. Some frivolous people, just like the rich man's son, often 'cheer up' at this time, thinking 'I got it, I got it,' and understand everything. This is also like people who learn to punch. When they have just learned a few movements, most of them think they are great and want to compete with others everywhere. (Note: Does the Chinese people want to compete with imperialism and modern revisionism? Deng Tuo said, no. Please see, what a disgusting look of a slave!) But the more they learn, and the more they really have some skills, the more humble they become. From this, it can be seen that the more incompetent they are, the more conceited they become; the more competent they are, the more humble and cautious they become."
      "If a student is conceited and kicks the teacher away after seeing that it is easy to enter the door, then he will not learn anything. Just like the rich man's son, he thought that it was no longer necessary to ask a teacher from now on. He didn't know that he hadn't even entered the door yet, and only learned one, two, three, and didn't understand even the most basic knowledge such as the so-called 'six books', so his father asked him to write an invitation to a relative named Wan, and he was dumbfounded."
      "There are still many things that we don't understand, and we urgently need to learn humbly. However, many problems in learning have not been thoroughly resolved. The story from three to ten thousand seems to give us some inspiration. We may as well take this as an example, draw inferences from one example, and think about how to better strengthen our learning."
          (First Collection: "From Three to Ten Thousand," June 8, 1961)
     "Some people can unite with those who are 'inferior', but cannot humbly unite with people who are stronger than themselves. ... It is good to welcome friends who are stronger than oneself, because one can learn from him and improve oneself."
          (First Collection: "The Way to Make Friends and Treat Guests," April 6, 1961)
     7. Around the Eighth Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee of the Party, Deng Tuo retreated in a hurry, and put forward "Thirty-Six Stratagems" to "take running away as the best policy"; announcing that he would wait until the "future" opportunity came before doing it again
      "I saw a mimeographed booklet entitled "Thirty-Six Stratagems"."
      "It lists the names of the thirty-six stratagems and cites examples of ancient military strategists using stratagems as proof, which is its commendable point."
      "The so-called thirty-six stratagems are directly related to the story of Tan Daoji avoiding Wei,..."
      "The stratagem used by Tan Daoji at that time was not just 'running away as the best policy'; if there were no other stratagems, he would not be able to run away. But he used several stratagems such as suspicious soldiers and espionage, cooperating with each other, so that the Wei army did not dare to pursue and could safely retreat." (Note: Deng Tuo wanted to "safely retreat," but could he get away? Today, the broad revolutionary people must reverse the black line of "Three-Family Village" anti-Party and anti-socialist.)
          (Fifth Collection: "'Thirty-Six Stratagems'," September 2, 1962)
    "Writing 'Night Talks' in the previous period was forced upon me. Now, dismounting is also to avoid having opinions about myself all the time. It is not too late to write again when there is a real insight in the future that must be written."
          (Fifth Collection: "Tell Readers," November 14, 1962)
    (II) Opposing Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, trying every possible way to promote the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution," advocating the bourgeois line of literature, art, academics, and education, opposing the cultural revolution of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie
    1. Erecting the black banner of "welcoming 'generalists'," frantically attacking Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, clamoring to seize leadership for landlord bourgeois "scholars"
      "Whether doing leadership work or scientific research work, one must have both specialized knowledge and broad knowledge. The former should be based on the latter."
      "However, some people fundamentally obliterate the relationship between the two, and isolate and one-sidedly emphasize the importance of specialized knowledge, while ignoring the more important significance of broad knowledge. According to their own wrong views, they often regard 'broad' as 'disorderly' and do not distinguish between them. Therefore, they despise people with relatively broad knowledge as 'generalists'."
      "As everyone knows, 'generalists' with real broad knowledge are rare and valuable. If this is called a 'generalist', then we should express a warm welcome to such a 'generalist'."
      "Well-known scholars in the old era can be said to be generalists to varying degrees. (Note: The "generalists" welcomed by Deng Tuo are reactionary figures of the landlord bourgeois "scholars" and the like.) Their collections of writings contain everything. The same book is useful for people who study social sciences, and it is also useful for people who study natural sciences."
      "Now, if we do not recognize the importance of the broad knowledge of the so-called 'generalist' for various leadership work and scientific research work, it will be our great loss."
       (First Collection: "Welcome 'Generalist'," March 26, 1961)
     2. Insisting on the bourgeois academic line, advocating "learning more and criticizing less," supporting the emergence of a large number of poisonous weeds, not allowing us to thoroughly criticize the ideology and culture of the exploiting classes
      "In fact, whether it is ideological criticism, academic criticism, etc., it is not aimed at 'attacking' or 'negating' everything; but to remove the dross and extract the essence, eliminate the false and retain the true, and better accept the legacy, develop culture, and develop our socialist cause."
      "If we do not adopt such a critical method and critical attitude to carry out research work, the result can only be subjective and arbitrary. And arbitrariness, as the opposite of criticism, is the enemy of science."
          (First Collection: "'Criticism' Correct Interpretation," May 14, 1961)
      "Learning more and criticizing less is a correct attitude of seeking knowledge that is worth advocating. ... This is also an important experience that our scholars of all dynasties have left us for managing learning and affairs. Anyone who ignores this valuable experience will definitely suffer a big loss." "Generally speaking, it is quite difficult to actually write a book, do something, etc.; while it is always not difficult to stand by and criticize. For example, the ancients often spent their entire lives writing a book and still couldn't be completely satisfied. But there is a group of people who like to be picky and often criticize it, making the author feel very disheartened."
    "From the experience of the ancients, we must understand a truth, that is: for everything, learn more and criticize less, and maintain a humble attitude."
          (Second Collection: "Learning More and Criticizing Less," August 24, 1961)
    3. Attacking Mao Zedong's literary and art line, advocating exposing "contradictions and defects in life," satirizing the new life of socialism
      "From our current point of view, the so-called humor, its manifestation is mainly because people's contradictions and defects in life cause a sympathetic bitter smile, and sometimes it will turn into ridicule, but it is not equal to satire."
    "In any case, there will always be certain contradictory phenomena in people's lives, which will inevitably make people feel ridiculous, so there will not be a little sense of humor. In short, our life itself will naturally bring all kinds of humor, and we need a little humor!"
          (Fifth Collection: "Life and Humor," May 13, 1962)
      "Generally speaking, the painters of the past could not analyze and criticize the social reality at that time, and after all, they did not dare to boldly expose its malpractices. Therefore, some painters chose a particularly implicit form of expression to express their dissatisfaction with the social reality at that time."
    "The most prominent cartoons should also mention the works of the so-called Yangzhou Eight Eccentrics. These painters were actually literati from the north and south who were dissatisfied with the reality at that time. They were indignant at the world, full of complaints, and out of place."
    "Here, let's take Luo Liangfeng's works as an example. ... He loved to paint ghosts all his life, and became famous for painting ghosts. People all know that his famous work is 'Ghost Fun Picture', which can be said to be a typical ancient cartoon."
      "His satire of ghosts is actually a satire of people. But in the society at that time, if a painter directly used cartoons to satirize those living people, it would definitely cause trouble; if he only satirized some dead ghosts, there would be no danger. Perhaps it was after these practical considerations that the painter finally chose this cartoon technique of using ghosts as the object of satire."
          (Third Collection: "Ancient Cartoons," November 2, 1961)
      "Some people once thought that the so-called creative inspiration is a concept of idealism, and there is actually no such thing as inspiration. Is this understanding correct? In all literary and artistic creation activities, is inspiration needed?"
      "Obviously, creative inspiration is nothing more than the product of the climax of all authors' thinking activities. It is produced when the attention of the highest and most precise material structure in the material structure of the human body - the brain - is most concentrated. Therefore, not only artists need inspiration when conducting image thinking; scientists also need inspiration when conducting theoretical discussions. Of course, any thinking process, if it is very calm, there are no waves, the brain's activity is not tense, or even there is no excitement, and it cannot form a climax, then, in this case, the so-called inspiration is generally not produced."
          (Fourth Collection: "Is Inspiration Needed for Creation?" March 15, 1962)
     4. Frantically promoting the feudal education system, opposing the proletarian education policy, conspiring to "train" a large number of successors of the landlord bourgeoisie
      "It seems that the whole set of methods of the old opera classes is in line with the principles of education. Our country also paid attention to the principle of 'teaching according to talent and using according to talent' in the cultivation and use of talents in ancient times. As recorded in 'Han Shu' and 'Dong Zhongshu Biography', Dong Zhongshu proposed in a memorial: 'Establish Tai University, set up Ming teachers, to support the scholars of the world, and examine them several times to exhaust their talents.' He also suggested: 'Grant officials according to talent and determine positions according to virtue.' Similar claims have been made in all dynasties, which can be said to be commonplace, and it is simply not easy to attract people's attention." "However, this method of cultivating and using talents according to their measure is more scientific, and it also starts from reality and meets practical needs. If the whole society adopts this method in an all-round way, it will be able to train all kinds of talents in a planned way."
          (Fifth Collection: "The Education Method of 'Opera Class'," June 28, 1962)
    "Yesterday, an old doctor of sixty-eight years old wrote and said:
      'I have a nineteen-year-old only daughter,... This summer, I originally planned to take the liberal arts examination of Beijing Normal University, but the health check proved that she failed due to her hearing relationship. If so, she has to stay at home. ... Father and daughter depend on each other for life, and I don't want her to register and travel far. ... Please ask how to change the status quo so that my little daughter is not idle at home?'"
    "According to the situation described by this old doctor, since his daughter cannot go to school because of her ear disease, and it is not appropriate to travel far from home, then what is the correct way? I think she should study at home according to plan. I don't know how many famous scholars in ancient times succeeded in self-study. ... This old doctor's daughter has more special and superior conditions than others, she can learn medicine from her father and further develop the family's knowledge. In the case of this doctor and his daughter 'depending on each other for life', they can just combine self-study with family tradition, on the one hand, solve the problem of the daughter's academic future; on the other hand, solve the problem of the father's inheritance of family learning. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?"
      "It is not unreasonable that it takes several generations to pass on the study of medicine to accumulate reliable experience. I hope that this old doctor who wrote to me and his daughter can make new achievements in our brand-new social system today by combining self-study and family tradition."
    "Of course, this way and method of self-study and family tradition is by no means limited to medicine alone, other aspects can also adopt this method to solve other difficult problems similar to this."
          (Fifth Collection: "Self-Study and Family Tradition," July 8, 1962)
    "According to the records of Sun Chengze's 'Jifu Figures Chronicle' in the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Shi had already shown a stubborn spirit of resistance when he participated in the examination in his early years. At that time, there was a story that said: 'When Shuntianfu examined the scholars, the scholars should carry their own

    请看“三家村”的反动真面目
    编者  鲍蔚文  吴英  钟华
    前言
    邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙“三家村”的反党反人民反社会主义面目已暴露于光天化日之下。广大工农兵群众和姚文元、高炬、何明等同志的文章对“三家村”进行了义正辞严的批判。为了帮助广大读者进一步洞察“三家村”的反动面目，我们特将《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》中射出的大量毒箭，加以摘录编排示众。为了便于阅读，有的地方我们加了一些注解。
    邓拓的《燕山夜话》，共一百五十三篇，内一百五十二篇发表于一九六一年三月至一九六二年九月《北京晚报》。其中一百五十篇，由北京出版社分五集出版。另有三篇：《陈绛和王耿的案件》《鸽子就叫做鸽子》《今年的春节》，因为作者心中有鬼，未收入集子。《三家村札记》，从一九六一年十月至一九六四年七月，发表于《前线》杂志，共六十七篇，署名吴南星。吴是吴晗，南是马南邨即邓拓，星是繁星即廖沫沙。
    《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》和《海瑞骂皇帝》《海瑞罢官》是一脉相承的，贯穿着一条反党反社会主义的黑线。这条黑线同当时国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华大合唱相呼应，同国内地富反坏右的复辟活动相呼应，和右倾机会主义分子在一起露骨地向党猖狂进攻，妄图使我们伟大的祖国改变颜色。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”现在，一个具有伟大历史意义的社会主义文化大革命正在兴起。在这场伟大的斗争中，广大工农兵群众、革命干部、革命知识分子更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，发扬革命精神，一定要彻底摧毁“三家村”这家大黑店，一定要打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，一定要把社会主义革命进行到底！
    《燕山夜话》反动内容摘要
  （一）恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，攻击无产阶级专政，攻击党的总路线
  1、攻击无产阶级专政，诬蔑党和国家“
     吏治已经日趋腐败”，诬蔑我们反对
     右倾机会主义分子的斗争是“扩大化
     和复杂化”；胡说什么“王道”比“
     霸道”好，谩骂我们伟大的党“想做
     霸主”“到处树敌”“不得人心”
   “最近偶然翻阅了宋代魏泰的《东轩笔录》，……有一些历史掌故很有趣味，可以打开人的思路。比如，书中记载陈绛和王耿的案件，就是一个例子。”
    “陈绛在福建，据说贪赃枉法，声名狼藉。当时临朝听政的明肃太后发觉了他的违法行为，责问宰相王沂公。这位宰相却一再支吾搪塞，最后迫不得已，又采取敷衍的态度，以致一错再错，充分暴露了他既无知人之明，又无料事的本领。”
    “当王耿（注：宰相派去彻查陈绛案件的官吏。）到达福建以后，冒冒失失地宣布了陈绛的几十条罪状。可是一一核对事实，才知道这几十条却是故意夸大和捏造的，同时衙校又揭发了王耿的儿子受贿赂的事实。这消息很快传到京城，明肃太后大怒，下令把王耿也关进了牢狱。于是这个案件就更加扩大了范围，内容也更加复杂了。”（注：读者注意，这是邓拓在用影射的手法恶毒地攻击党！）
      “读历史的人只要用冷静客观的态度，仔细分析这个案件的主要情节，都不难发现它的扩大化和复杂化，有一个重要的原因，这就是宋代政府在明肃太后临朝期间，吏治已经日趋腐败。上边用人行政没有精明强干的宰相和他的僚属认真负责；下边的地方官吏则为所欲为，实际上形成了尾大不掉的局面。”
  （注：看，邓拓竟然这样指桑骂槐，攻击无产阶级专政！）
          （《陈绛和王耿的案件》，《北京晚报》一九六一年
    六月二十二日）
      “那末，照我们现在的观点，用我们的语言来说，究竟什么是王道，什么是霸道呢？所谓王道，可以做一种解释，就是老老实实的从实际出发的群众路线的思想作风；而所谓霸道，也可以做一种解释，就是咋咋呼呼的凭主观武断的一意孤行的思想作风。不过，这种解释是不能强加于古人的，用这种观点去评论古人也是不合实际的。”
      “但是，无论如何，从古代的历史中，人们却也不难找出经验教训，说明即便在古代，王道也毕竟要比霸道好得多。《汉书》的作者班固，追述秦汉以前诸侯争霸的局势时，在好几个地方都对霸道有所讥刺。……这使人一看就会感觉到当时要想做霸主的，到处树敌，多么不得人心！”（注：这同赫鲁晓夫修正主义咒骂我们是“霸权主义”有什么两样！）	（四集：《王道和霸道》，一九六二年二月二十五日。
   发表日期根据《北京晚报》，下同。）
    2、诬蔑和诅咒我们党的领导“爱说大
       话”，是“吹牛的骗子”；“自己
       逞能”“自作聪明”，“终久会有
       一天要吃大亏”
      “王充在《论衡》中指出：‘儒者之言，溢美过实。’他的意思显然是认为，文人之流往往爱说大话。其实，爱说大话的还有其他各色人等，决不只是文人之流而已。”
      “历史上说大话的真人真事，虽然有许多，但是这些编造的故事却更富有概括性，它们把说大话的各种伎俩集中在典型的故事情节里，这样更能引人注意，提高警惕，因而也就更有教育意义了。”
          （五集：《说大话的故事》，一九六一年六月十一日）
    “事实显然证明，说大话的只能胡吹牛皮，决不可能采取行动。直到如今，这样吹牛的人物，随时随地都还可以遇见。他们之中，牛皮吹的大小虽然有所不同，但是，其为吹牛则一。”
    “马赫派自以为凭着他们的心理要素的作用，就能够为所欲为，而其结果，只能在实际的事物面前碰得头破血流，最后必然要宣告马赫派的破产。”（注：此句在《北京晚报》发表的原文是：“马赫派自以为凭着他们的心理要素的作用，就能够克服任何困难，而其结果，困难不但不会被克服，反而越来越多，其严重性也日益增大，最后必然要宣告马赫派的破产。”马赫是主观唯心主义者，邓拓竟然把我们伟大的党诬蔑为马赫派，妄想我们伟大祖国的建设事业宣告破产，其用心之恶毒，昭然若揭。）
    “山雀在牛皮吹破以后，只不过害羞地飞走了，这当然是幸运的；应该看到，在另外的情况下，牛皮既已吹破，受骗的人们就决不会轻易地放走吹牛的骗子。”
      （五集：《两则外国寓言》，一九六一年十一月二十六日）
    “汉光武帝时著名的学者郑兴，也曾经劝告刘秀，要‘博采广谋，纳群下之策’。宋代范仲淹的儿子范尧夫，曾经劝告司马光说：‘愿公虚心以延众论，不必谋自己出。谋自己出，则谄谀得乘间迎合矣。’这些古人的见解都很不错。特别是范尧夫所说的‘不必谋自己出’，这一点尤其值得注意。有的人常常喜欢自己逞能，自作聪明，看不起群众，不管什么事情总是要自己出主意，企图出奇制胜，而不接受下面群众的好意见。有这种毛病的人，如果自己不觉悟，不改正这种毛病，终久会有一天要吃大亏。”
     （四集：《智谋是可靠的吗？》，一九六二年二月二十二日）
      3、疯狂地反对党的总路线、大跃进，
        诬蔑我们党“用空想代替了现实”，
        把“一个鸡蛋的家当”“打得精
        光”；恶毒地诽谤我们党不懂得
        “爱护劳动力”
    “我们平常说某人有了家当，就是承认他有许多家财，却不会相信一个鸡蛋能算得了什么家当！”
    “明代万历年间，有一位小说家，名叫江盈科。他编写了一部《雪涛小说》，其中有一个故事说：‘一市人，贫甚，朝不谋夕。偶一日，拾得一鸡卵，喜而告其妻曰：我有家当矣。妻问安在？持卵示之，曰：此是，然须十年，家当乃就。因与妻计曰：我持此卵，借邻人伏鸡乳之，待彼雏成，就中取一雌者，归而生卵，一月可得十五鸡。两年之内，鸡又生鸡，可得鸡三百，堪易十金。我以十金易五牸，牸复生牸，三年可得二十五牛。牸所生者，又复生牸，三年可得百五十牛，堪易三百金矣。吾持此金以举债，三年间，半千金可得也。’”
      “你看这个故事不是可以说明许多问题吗？这个财迷也知道，家当的积累是需要不少时间的。因此，他同老婆计算要有十年才能挣到这份家当。这似乎也合于情理。但是，他的计划简直没有任何可靠的根据，而完全是出于一种假设，每一个步骤都以前一个假设的结果为前提。对于十年以后的事情，他统统用空想代替了现实，充分显出了财迷的本色，以致激起老婆生气，一拳头就把他的家当打得精光。”（注：邓柘在这里对我国人民自力更生、艰苦奋斗，改变一穷二白面貌的伟大革命精神极端仇视，刻毒咒骂我们“统统用空想代替了现实”。）
        （一集：《一个鸡蛋的家当》，一九六一年六月十五日）
    “早在春秋战国及其前后的时期，许多古代的大政治家已经知道爱护劳动力的重要意义。……他们通过自己的统治经验，却也发现了所谓‘使用民力’的‘限度’，实际上就是发现了劳动力消长的某些客观规律。”
    “《礼记》《王制篇》写道：‘用民之力，岁不过三日。’……其实，用现代的话来讲解，这就是指的各种基本建设所用的劳动力。按照当时社会的生产力水平，古人规定了各种基本建设所用的劳动力，大致只能占总劳动力的百分之一左右。现在看来，这个比例对于以农业生产为根本的古老国家是适当的”。
    “《周礼》上又记载着：‘丰年三日，中年二日，无年则一日而已。’这就是说，在丰年基本建设占用的劳动力可以达到总劳动力的百分之一左右；平常的中等年景，只能占用百分之零点六左右；没有什么收成的荒年顶多只能占用百分之零点三左右。”
    “我们应该从古人的经验中得到新的启发，更加注意在各方面努力爱护劳动力”，“有许多事情必须估量自己的能力是否胜任，决不可过于勉强。”（注：《礼记》是古代一部记载地主阶级礼法的书，邓拓在这里是说，看，地主老爷是多么爱惜“民力”啊！要我们无产阶级从中得到“新的启发”，这不是诽谤我们党不爱护劳动力又是什么！）
      （一集：《爱护劳动力的学说》，一九六一年四月三十日）
     4、极端仇视社会主义事业大发展，叫
        嚣“解冻”，咒骂不肯“放下”就等
        于瞎子，鼓吹“放下即实地”，要我
        们撒手不革命
      “北风带来的严寒季节就要结束了，代之而起的将是和暖的东风，大地很快就要解冻了，……”（注“解冻”是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团反斯大林时用的反革命语言。在“三家村”的人们看来，“解冻”了，就是意味着资本主义势力和封建势力复辟的时机来到了。）
          （《今年的春节》，《北京晚报》一九六二年二月四日）
    “这几天整理旧书，偶然又拿出明代刘元卿的《应谐录》，翻阅其中有一则写道：
    ‘有盲子过涸溪桥上，失坠，两手攀楯，兢兢握固，自分失手必坠深渊。过者告曰：无怖，第放下即实地也。盲子不信，握楯长号。久之，手惫，失手坠地。乃自哂曰：嘻，蚤知是实地，何久自苦耶？’”
    “看了这个小故事，觉得很有启发。有的人自己虽然不是瞎子，但是平常遇到某些事情，实际上却很象这个故事中的瞎子所表现的。（注：这是对革命人民的恶毒攻击！）这是为什么呢？根本的原因是由于不了解实际情况，心中无数，所以遇事没有把握，不知如何是好。”
      “遇事完全可以不必害怕，不要象这个故事中的瞎子那样，生怕坠入深渊，拼命抓住桥楯不肯放手；尽管放心大胆地撒手，要知道‘放下即实地’，又有什么可怕呢？”（注：所谓“放下”，就是要我们下马，要我们不革命！）
      “有时办一件事情的时候，由于调查研究工作做得不够，总觉得自己带有某种程度的盲目性。甚至周围的群众也提出一些有益的意见，反映了若干正确的情况，只是自己因为心中无数，也无法判断这些意见和情况的正确与否。……到了事实完全弄清楚的时候，有些问题又事过景迁了，心里感到十分懊恼。这正如那个瞎子说的，早知道放下即实地，又何必自讨苦吃呢？”
          （三集：《“放下即实地”》，一九六一年十一月五日）
     5、借明代李三才、米万钟“辞官”、
        “罢官”，为罢了官的右倾机会主
        义分子喊冤叫屈，要为他们“分别
        立传”；同时，自命为政治上的反
        对派，攻击我们党“片面地只强调
        政治”是“极端错误的”
    “他（注：指李三才。）反对当时征收矿税的办法，并且积极支持东林党人。”“因为多次上疏没有结果，李三才曾经请求辞官回家，却又有许多朝士上疏加以挽留。”
    “当然，在那个时候还出现了攻击封建黑暗政治的‘东林党人’，（注：东林党是明代由在野的官僚政客等组成的地主阶级反对派。）而‘三才与深相结’。因此，当时有一班顽固腐败的势力，极力攻击顾宪成、高攀龙等东林党人，同时也极力攻击李三才。后来魏忠贤的一伙人，更把李三才和东林党人同样当做不共戴天的仇敌，那是毫不足怪的。”
      “甚至在李三才终于退归故里以后，他们还要把‘盗皇木营建私第’等罪名，加于李三才身上。……李三才又一再上疏，‘请遣中官按问’，‘请诸臣会勘’，‘请上亲鞫’。看来他是理直气壮的，而万历的朝廷却不敢彻底查究这个事实。问题的真相如何，这不是很明白了吗？”
       （五集：《为李三才辩护》，一九六二年三月二十九日）
      “米万钟是一位很有学问也很有骨气的人。……据称，米万钟为政清廉，关心民刑和文教事业，所到之处，颇受中下层人民和文士们的称颂。”
      “由于米万钟平日鄙视魏忠贤及其同伙，并且屡次评议时事，他就成了魏忠贤的眼中钉。特别是魏忠贤的走狗倪文焕极力诬陷好人，当时被他陷害的有几十人，重的严刑拷打致死，轻的则被削籍夺职。米万钟也受到了削籍夺职的处治。”
      “过去各地方编辑地方志的时候，照例要提出一批所谓‘乡贤’的名单，然后收集资料，分别立传。我们现在如果要编辑北京志，那末，显然也应该考虑给宛平大小米（注：指明末的官僚米万钟，清初的官僚米汉雯。）以适当的地位。”
          （三集：《宛平大小米》，一九六一年十一月九日）
    “‘风声、雨声、读书声，声声入耳；
    家事、国事、天下事，事事关心。’
    这是明代东林党首领顾宪成撰写的一副对联。”
      “上联的意思是讲书院的环境便于人们专心读书。这十一个字很生动地描写了自然界的风雨声和人们的读书声交织在一起的情景，令人仿佛置身于当年的东林书院中，耳朵里好象真的听见了一片朗诵和讲学的声音，与天籁齐鸣。”
    “下联的意思是讲在书院中读书的人都要关心政治。这十一个字充分地表明了当时的东林党人在政治上的抱负。他们主张不能只关心自己的家事，还要关心国家的大事和全世界的事情。”（注：东林党的政治抱负是取当时的中央政权而代之。看，“三家村”的政治野心有多大！）
      “片面地只强调读书，而不关心政治；或者片面地只强调政治，而不努力读书，都是极端错误的。不读书而空谈政治的人，只是空头的政治家，决不是真正的政治家。”
          （二集：《事事关心》，一九六一年十月五日）
     6、同赫鲁晓夫修正主义一个腔调，疯
        狂诅咒我们伟大的党是“自命不
        凡”的“妄人”，“起码的知识一
        点也不懂”，就“以为从此可不必
        再请老师了”，“对于比自己强的
        人却不能虚心团结”
      “哪一个妄人如果想一下子就把什么都学会，其结果必定要吃大亏。”
    “初学的一个最重要关节，就是在刚刚学会一、二、三或外国文A、B、C等等的时候。有一些轻浮的人，正如那个富翁的儿子一样，往往在这个时候就‘欣欣然’起来，以为‘得矣，得矣’，什么都懂得了。这也好象学打拳的人，刚学会几个动作的时候，多半以为自己很了不得，处处想跟别人较量几下子。（注：中国人民想同帝国主义、现代修正主义较量吗？邓拓说，不行。请看，这是一付多么可恶的奴才相！）倒是学得多了，真正有了一些本领，才反而虚心起来。由此可见，越是没有本领的就越加自命不凡；越是有本领的才越加谦虚谨慎。”
      “学生如果自命不凡，看到入门很容易，就把老师一脚踢开，那末，他就什么也学不成。正如那个富翁的儿子一样，他以为从此可不必再请老师了。殊不知他根本还不曾入门，只学会一、二、三，对于所谓‘六书’等起码的知识一点也不懂，所以他父亲叫他给姓万的亲友写一个请帖，他就傻眼了。”
      “我们不懂的东西还很不少，都迫切需要虚心学习。但是，在学习方面有许多问题，并没有得到彻底的解决。从三到万这个故事似乎对我们有一些启发。我们无妨以此为例，举一反三，想一想怎样才能更好地加强我们的学习吧。”
          （一集：《从三到万》，一九六一年六月八日）
     “有的人对于‘不及者’倒还可以团结，而对于比自己强的人却不能虚心团结。……要欢迎朋友比自己强，这对自己有好处，因为可以向他学习，提高自己。”
          （一集：《交友待客之道》，一九六一年四月六日）
     7、党的八届十中全会召开前后，邓拓
        仓皇退却，提出了“三十六计”以
        “走为上”；宣布要等到“将来”
        时机到来时再干
      “看到一本题名为《三十六计》的油印小册子”。
      “它列举了三十六计的名目，并且引述了古代兵家用计的实例作为证明，这是它的可取之处。”
      “所谓三十六计与檀道济避魏的故事直接有关，……”
      “檀道济当时所用的计策，并不只是以‘走为上’；如果没有其他计策，他要走也走不了。可是他用了疑兵、反间等几种计策，互相配合，使魏军不敢追逼，才能安全退走。”（注：邓拓想“安全退走”了，但是能溜得了么？今天，广大革命人民一定要反掉“三家村”反党反社会主义的黑线。）
          （五集：《“三十六计”》，一九六二年九月二日）
    “前一个时期写《夜话》是被人拉上马的，现在下马也是为了避免自己对自己老有意见。等将来确有一点心得，非写不可的时候，再写不迟。”
          （五集：《奉告读者》，一九六二年十一月十四日）
    （二）反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，千方百计地推行“和平演变”的阴谋，鼓吹资产阶级的文艺、学术、教育路线，反对兴无灭资的文化革命
    1、竖起“欢迎‘杂家’”的黑旗，
       疯狂攻击马克思列宁主义、毛泽
       东思想，叫嚷为地主资产阶级“
       学者”夺取领导权
      “无论做什么样的领导工作或科学研究工作，既要有专门的学问，又要有广博的知识。前者应以后者为基础。”
      “但是，有的人根本抹杀这两者之间的关系，孤立地片面地强调专门学问的重要性，而忽视了广博知识的更重要意义。他们根据自己的错误看法，还往往以‘广博’为‘杂乱’，不知加以区别。因而，他们见到知识比较广博的人，就鄙视之为‘杂家’。”
      “殊不知，真正具有广博知识的‘杂家’，却是难能可贵的。如果这就叫做‘杂家’，那末，我们倒应该对这样的‘杂家’表示热烈的欢迎。”
      “旧时代知名的学者，程度不等地都可以说是杂家。（注：邓拓欢迎的“杂家”，就是那些地主资产阶级“学者”之流的反动人物。）他们的文集中什么都有。同样的一部书，对于研究社会科学的人有用，对于研究自然科学的人也有用。”
      “现在我们如果不承认所谓‘杂家’的广博知识对于各种领导工作和科学研究工作的重要意义，那将是我们的很大损失。”
       （一集：《欢迎“杂家”》，一九六一年三月二十六日）
     2、坚持资产阶级的学术路线，鼓吹“
        多学少评”，支持大批毒草出笼，
        不准我们对剥削阶级思想文化进
        行彻底批判
      “其实，不论是思想批判、学术批判等等，决不是以‘打击’或‘否定’一切为目的的；而是为了去粗取精，去伪存真，更好地接受遗产，发展文化，发展我们的社会主义事业。”
      “如果不采取这样的批判方法和批判态度来进行研究工作，结果就只能是主观武断。而武断，作为批判的对立面，却是科学的敌人。”
          （一集：《“批判”正解》，一九六一年五月十四日）
      “多学少评，这是值得提倡的正确的求知态度。……这也是我国历代学者留给我们的一条重要的治学和办事的经验。谁要是无视这条宝贵的经验，就一定会吃大亏。”“一般说来，实际动手写一部书、做一件事等等，是相当不易的；而袖手旁观，评长论短，总是不大费劲的。比如，古人写一部书吧，往往尽一生的精力，还不能完全满意。却有一班喜欢挑剔的人，动辄加以讥评，使作者十分寒心。”
    “我们从古人的经验中，必须懂得一个道理，这就是：对一切事物，要多学习，少批评，保持虚心的态度。”
          （二集：《多学少评》，一九六一年八月二十四日）
    3、攻击毛泽东文艺路线，鼓吹暴露
          “生活中的矛盾和缺陷”，讽刺社
        会主义的新生活
      “从我们现在的观点看来，所谓幽默，它的表现形式主要是由于人们对生活中的矛盾和缺陷，引起了一种同情的苦笑，有时也会变成讥笑，但是，它并不等于讽刺。”
    “无论如何，人们的生活中总会有某些矛盾的现象，不免会叫人觉得可笑，因此，就不会没有一点幽默感。总之，我们的生活本身，自然会带来种种幽默，也需要有一点幽默啊！”
          （五集：《生活和幽默》，一九六二年五月十三日）
      “一般地说来，历来的画家们对于当时的社会现实不但不可能进行分析和批判，而且毕竟还不敢大胆地揭露它的弊病。于是有一些画家就选择了特别含蓄的表现形式，以表达他们对当时的社会现实不满的情绪。”
    “最突出的漫画，还应该说到所谓扬州八怪的作品。这些画家实际上都是当时南北各地不满于现实的文人，他们愤世嫉俗，满腹牢骚，不合时宜。”
    “在这里，就举罗两峰的作品为例吧。……他生平最爱画鬼，并且以画鬼而成名。人们都知道他的成名之作乃是《鬼趣图》，这可以说是古代漫画的典型了。”
      “他对鬼的讽刺，实际上却是对人的讽刺。但是在当时的社会上，画家如果直接用漫画去讽刺那班活人，一定要惹祸；如果只是讽刺一些死鬼，就不至于有什么危险了。也许正是经过了这些实际的考虑之后，画家终于选择了以鬼为讽刺对象的这种漫画手法。”
          （三集：《古代的漫画》，一九六一年十一月二日）
      “曾经有人认为，所谓创作的灵感是唯心的概念，实际上并不存在什么灵感。这种认识对不对呢？在一切文艺创作活动中，究竟要不要灵感呢？”
      “很明显，创作的灵感无非是一切作者思维活动的高潮的产物。它是人体这个物质结构中最高级最精密的物质构造——大脑的注意力最集中的时候所产生的。因此，不但艺术家在进行形象思维的时候，要有灵感；科学家在进行论理探讨的时候，也要有灵感。当然，任何思维过程，如果非常平静，没有什么波澜，大脑的活动不紧张，甚至于没有出现兴奋状态，不能形成高潮，那末，在这种情况下，所谓灵感一般地是不会产生的。”
          （四集：《创作要不要灵感》，一九六二年三月十五日）
     4、猖狂宣扬封建主义的教育制度，反
        对无产阶级的教育方针，阴谋“造
        就”大量地主资产阶级的接班人
      “看来旧科班的这一整套方法是符合于教育学原理的。我国古代对于人才的培养和使用，也很注意‘量才而教之，量才而用之’的原则。如《汉书》《董仲舒传》记载，董仲舒在一篇奏疏中提出建议：‘兴太学，置明师，以养天下之士，数考问以尽其才。’他还建议：‘量才而授官，录德而定位。’类似这样的主张，历代都有，可以说是老生常谈，简直很不容易引起人们的重视。”“然而，这种量体裁衣地培养和使用人才的方法是比较科学的，也是从实际出发、符合实际需要的。整个社会全面地采用这种方法，就能够有计划地造就各种各样的人才。”

    “昨天，一位六十八岁的老医师来信说：
      ‘我有一个十九岁的独生女，……今夏本拟应北京师范大学文科考试，昨健康检查证明，以听力关系不及格，如是只好在家。……父女相依为命，不愿她登记远行。……请问应如何改变现状，不令小女闲坐在家？’”
    “就这位老医师所述的情况而论，他的女儿既然因为耳朵有病不能升学，又不宜离家远行，那末，正确的办法是什么呢？我以为她应该有计划地在家自学。古来不知有多少著名的学者都是自学成功的。……这位老医师的女儿更有比别人特殊优越的条件，她可以跟她的父亲学医，使家传的学问进一步发扬光大起来。在这位医师父女二人‘相依为命’的情况下，他们正好可以把自学与家传相结合，一方面解决女儿的学业前途问题；另一方面解决父亲的家学继承问题。这样不是一举两得吗？”
      “学医的要几辈相传才能积累可靠的经验，这不是没有道理的。我希望给我写信的这位老医师和他的女儿，能够在我们今天崭新的社会制度下，以自学和家传相结合的办法，做出新的成绩。”
    “当然，这种自学与家传的途径和办法，绝不限于医学一个方面，其他方面同样可以采取这个办法，以解决与此类似的其他困难问题。”
          （五集：《自学与家传》，一九六二年七月八日）
    “照清代孙承泽的《畿辅人物志》的记载看来，张诗早年参加考试的时候，就曾显露出一种倔强的反抗精神。当时有一个故事说：‘顺天府试士，士当自负几入试。诗使其家僮代之，试官不许，遂拂衣出。’”
      “这从我们现在的观点来说，似乎张诗对待劳动的态度很有问题。为什么自己抬一个书桌都不肯，偏偏要叫家童去抬呢？这不是鄙视劳动吗？”
      “然而，如果从当时的历史条件和具体情况出发，加以分析，那末，我们就不应该过分地责怪张诗，反而应该承认这是他对封建考试制度表示强烈反抗的一种方式。”

      “古人每到书多的时候，往往也有了相当的地位，正如袁枚说的：‘通籍后，俸去书来，落落大满，素蟫灰丝，时蒙卷轴。’这不能不引起认真的读书人的警惕，他们时常写下许多座右铭、对联之类以鞭策自己，生怕一天到晚忙忙碌碌，什么书也没有读。以古喻今，那末，我们现在就更要趁着年青的时候，抓紧机会，赶快读书。”
          （四集：《有书赶快读》，一九六二年五月十日）
      “距今一千九百年前，在洛阳城里的书摊旁边，有一位年青的读书人，（注：指王充。）时常站着或者蹲着看书。他看了一本又一本，日子久了，差不多把书摊上的书籍全都读完了。凡是读过的书，他常常都会背诵。这个青年人后来成了一位著名的学者，就决不是偶然的。我们现在的青年读者，如果能够学习王充的精神，勤苦读书，又有什么不好呢？”

      “要想专攻一门学问，或者专门研究一个问题，就必须读尽这一门学问或这一个问题有关的一切图书资料。而要达到这个目的，又必须知道这许多图书资料所属的门类。否则到处瞎碰，什么也学不成。郑樵自己所以能够写成象《通志》那样的大书，就因为他生平勤学苦读，到处‘搜奇访古’，遇见人家收藏有图书的，就要借读，抄录了大批重要的材料，进行研究。他的经验是非常可贵的，我们应该好好学习。”

    6、吹捧地主阶级的老祖宗，坚持用地
        主资产阶级道德改造社会，妄图恢
        复剥削阶级统治
    “从《贫士传》中可以看到，古来许多有骨气的人，虽然在非常穷困的条件下生活，周围又有恶势力对他们进行威胁利诱，但是，他们坚定不移地表现了崇高的气节，真是象俗谚说的‘人穷志不穷’，不能不叫人肃然起敬。”

      “有一班人八面讨好，谁也不得罪，自以为很有涵养，其实在我们看来乃是典型的‘乡愿’，多么卑鄙可耻啊！”（注：资产阶级右派经常攻击左派为“乡愿”。吴晗也赞扬右倾机会主义分子反对“乡愿”。邓拓又在这里咬牙切齿地咒骂听党的话的同志为“乡愿”。真是物以类聚，反动阶级的人物连使用的语言都是一样的。）

      “颜渊问孔子：所谓‘克己复礼’应该怎样解释？孔子回答说：‘非礼勿视，非礼勿听，非礼勿言，非礼勿动。’”
      “孔子说的话有许多是我们根本不能赞同的；但是，他说明克己复礼的意义所讲的这四句话，只要加以正确的解释，我觉得还有一些道理。”
          （二集：《非礼勿》，一九六一年八月六日）
      “前次的《夜话》曾经提到《扬子法言》中的一句话——‘颜苦孔之卓也’。”
      “他（注：指扬雄。）在文章中反复说明，颜回以他自己能够学习孔子为最大的快乐。……如果把语气更加强调一下，那末，他的意思也可以说，孔子是高尚至极了，卓越至极了，无论如何学不到，所以说，颜苦孔之卓之至也。”
      “我们现在对于扬雄的《法言》等著作，当然可以也应该加以研究。对于他所推崇的颜回学习孔子的经验，如果能够有批判地拿来运用，变成正确的对于真理的追求和学习，那就很有益处了。”

    《三家村札记》反动内容摘要
    （一）恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，反对社会主义革命和社会主义建设
      1、攻击党的领导“爱说伟大的空话”，
         咒骂“东风压倒西风”是“陈词滥
         调”
      “说了半天还是不知所云，越解释越糊涂，或者等于没有解释。这就是伟大的空话的特点。”
      “这种伟大的空话在某些特殊的场合是不可避免的，因而在一定的意义上有其存在的必要。可是，如果把它普遍化起来，到处搬弄，甚至于以此为专长，那就相当可怕了。假若再把这种说空话的本领教给我们的后代，培养出这么一批专家，那就更糟糕了。因此，遇有这样的事情，就必须加以劝阻。”
      “凑巧得很，我的邻居有个孩子近来常常模仿大诗人的口气，编写了许多‘伟大的空话’，……不久以前，他写了一首‘野草颂’，通篇都是空话。他写的是：
        ‘老天是我们的父亲，
        大地是我们的母亲，
        太阳是我们的褓姆，
        东风是我们的恩人，
        西风是我们的敌人。
        ……’”
      “这首诗里尽管也有天地、父母、太阳、褓姆、东风、西风、恩人、敌人等等引人注目的字眼，然而这些都被他滥用了，变成了陈词滥调。”
      “到了有话非说不可的时候，说出的话才能动人。否则内容空虚，即便用了最伟大的字眼和词汇，也将无济于事，甚至越说得多，反而越糟糕。因此，我想奉劝爱说伟大的空话的朋友，还是多读，多想，少说一些，遇到要说话的时候，就去休息，不要浪费你自己和别人的时间和精力吧！”
          （《“伟大的空话”》，《前线》一九六一年第二十一
    期，十一月十日出版）
     2、辱骂我们党“言而无信”“不堪
        信任”，患了严重的“健忘症”，
        “必须赶紧完全休息”
    “世上有病的人很多，所患的病症更是千奇百怪，无所不有，其中有一种病症，名叫‘健忘症’。谁要是得了这种病症，就很麻烦，不容易治好。”
    “得了这种病的人，往往有许多症状，比如，见过的东西很快都忘了，说过的话很快也忘了，做过的事更记不得了。因此，这种人常常表现出自食其言和言而无信，甚至于使人怀疑他是否装疯卖傻，不堪信任。”
      “看来这位健忘病者的症状，已经达到相当严重的地步。但是，我们还不能估计这种病症发展到最严重的时候，会变成什么样子，大概总不外乎发疯或者变傻这两个结果。”
    “患这种病的……必须赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做，勉强说话做事，就会出大乱子。”
      “对这种病症，难道就没有一点积极治疗的方法吗？当然不是。比如，古代有的巫医，主张在发病的时候，马上用一盆狗血，从病人的头上淋下去，然后再用冷水冲洗，可使神志稍清，一次不愈，则连治三次。……现代西医的办法，有的是在发病的时候，用一根特制的棍棒，打击病人的头部，使之‘休克’，然后再把他救醒。”（注：读者特别注意，“三家村”对党对人民用心是何等凶狠毒辣！）
          （《专治“健忘症”》，《前线》一九六二年第十四
    期，七月二十五日出版）
     3、猖狂地攻击我们党的领导是“主观
        主义”“教条主义”，“自以为是”，
        “害己、害人、误国”
      “赵括和马谡都是好人，不是坏人，他们的主观愿望都是要办好事情的。却吃了主观主义的亏，吃了教条主义的亏，自以为是，光凭书本知识、理论知识，不顾客观形势，不听有实践经验人们的劝告，结果是摔了大跟斗。……光凭书本上的理论，自以为是，因而失败，害己、害人、误国的教训。时间虽然隔得很久了，今天来重温这些教训，看来还是有益的。”
          （《赵括和马谡》，《前线》一九六二年第二期，一
    月二十五日出版）
    4、破口大骂革命的马克思主义者是
       “一些口称不怕鬼而实际怕鬼怕得
       要死的人”，说要使他们“丑态百
       出”
    “中国科学院文学研究所出版过一本《不怕鬼的故事》。这当然是本好书。但是现在看来，单是一本《不怕鬼的故事》还不够用，还得有一本《怕鬼的故事》。”
      “在《不怕鬼的故事》中，……不论怕鬼的与不怕鬼的，又都有一个共同点：都承认有鬼。是一群‘有鬼论’者，而不是‘无鬼论’者。”
      “王富（注：王富和下面提到的张祥，都是明朝人写的《雅谑》这部书中的人物。）敢于‘出尸而伏棺’，并且自己去装鬼吓人，可见他心目中是没有鬼的，所以他不怕。张祥虽口出大言：‘吾能黑夜出之’，实际上却心里怀着一个鬼胎，所以一见棺已离盖，就惊疑不止，再见棺中伸出两只手，更心惊胆裂，分不清是人是鬼，慌忙告饶许愿；还不行，就失声大叫，以至惊恐欲绝，显出一副活见鬼的丑态。”
      “张祥既是一个怕鬼怕得要死的人，为什么又口讲大话，敢连夜去开棺出尸呢？故事中也交待：为了赌胜王富所许的一坛酒，就连自己的胆量究竟是大是小，也忘之脑后。他不但好酒贪杯，见利忘义，而且是个空口说大话，顾前不顾后的赌棍。”
      “我说，还得有一本《怕鬼的故事》，就正是要挑选一些口称不怕鬼而实际怕鬼怕得要死的人，把他们写成故事，以便活画出他们的丑态百出。”
      “上引故事的原作者，署名为‘浮白斋主人’。看他写的这段故事，倒真是值得浮一大白；他的书名是《雅谑》，也的确是既雅且谑。一个明朝人能这样写作，难道我们今日就没有这样的有才有志之士来‘雅谑’一番么？”
          （《怕鬼的“雅谑”》，《前线》一九六一年第二十
    二期，十一月二十五日出版）
    5、攻击我们党“言而不行”“言行不一”，
       不讲科学，不接受遗产，“造成损害”
    “一、谈的是科学话，这没有问题，问题是在你只是‘谈’科学话，不‘办’科学事，这是言而不行的问题。”
    “二、谈的虽是科学话，办的却不是科学事，而是另一些非科学的事。这是言与行不一致的问题，怪不上科学理论的本身，只能怪你自己为什么放下科学事不办，去办那些不科学的事。”
    “三、你所谈的本不是什么科学，只是号称‘科学’，所以办不出科学事来。”
    “四、理论同实际不符合，谈的‘科学话’同办的‘科学事’碰不上头。”
        （《科学话同科学事》，《前线》一九六二年第九期，五月十日出版）
    “现在有许多人对于古为今用的原则，不知道如何执行，其原因就在于他们不会批判地总结前人的经验，不善于接受遗产。……有许多地方，明明看到有些做法与大多数人长期积累的经验相违背，并且已经引起了不良的后果而不敢断然做出决定，以致迁延时日，造成损害，那也不一定都是必要的。比如，在农业生产方面有些问题便是证明。”
      “有的人往往就把群众的经验丢在一边，对于中国历代农学的遗产基本上采取了否认的态度。最明显的例子是关于农田水利问题的。”
          （《重视群众的经验》，《前线》一九六三年第十一期，六月十日出版）
     6、阴险地诽谤我们的干部只会耍“太
        极拳”，“只希望自己越省心越好”，
        “无形中造成了一股歪风”
      “为什么要强调多用心呢？因为现在的确有一些人不善于用心，甚至于不喜欢用心，只希望自己越省心越好，不管遇到什么情况和问题，满不在乎地耍一套‘太极拳’，就把事情对付过去了。这种现象虽然只是发生在少数人身上，可是影响却很不小，无形中造成了一股歪风，如果任其发展下去，其结果就可能会妨害我们的工作不能更快更好地取得应有的效果。”
          （《多用心》，《前线》一九六二年第十七期，九月
    十日出版）
     7、借古诗来散播和发泄对党和社会主
        义事业的强烈仇恨，企图达到“三
        家村”的反动政治野心
      “我在青年时期读杜诗，印象最深刻的一首，却是《奉赠韦左丞二十二韵》，我对这首诗感触深刻，以至三十多年来还能随口背诵，例如‘纨袴不饿死，儒冠多误身’；‘读书破万卷，下笔如有神’；‘自谓颇挺出，立登要路津，致君尧舜上，再使风俗淳’；我背诵得最熟而又感受最深的是这几句：
  ‘此意竟萧条，行歌非隐沦，骑驴十三载，旅食京华春，朝扣富儿门，暮随肥马尘，残杯与冷炙，到处潜悲辛！’每当背诵到这些地方，不但心里是酸酸的，而且眼前立即浮现出一个年逾三十还飘泊无依的穷书生，生活逼迫着他风尘仆仆地东奔西走。”
    “在我的青年时期，我之所以对这首诗感触特别深刻，是因为我虽同杜甫相隔一千多年，自己的才能更不能与杜甫相比，但是所处的社会环境却大体相似，同样是‘纨袴不饿死，儒冠多误身’的阶级社会。在那样的社会，任何一个‘自谓颇挺出’的穷青年，即使满身抱负，壮志凌云，也都无济于事：在社会上闯来闯去若干年，最后不能不落为‘青冥却垂翅，蹭蹬无纵鳞’。”

  （二）宣扬地主资产阶级的腐朽意识形态，在思想领域中推行“和平演变”的阴谋，反对文化革命，为牛鬼蛇神复辟鸣锣开道
    1、鼓吹剥削阶级道德，为反革命政治
       服务
    “统治阶级的道德论在一般情况下，也就成为被统治阶级的道德论，巩固统治阶级的统治了。”
    “孔子和他的后继者的学说，成为教育全国人民的经典，许多世代以来，人们都把他的学说作为判别是非的准绳。”
      “问题是封建社会的道德论的某些部分，有没有值得今人吸取的地方，我以为是有的。”
    “例如忠，过去要忠于君主，今天呢，难道不应该忠于国家，忠于人民，忠于社会主义建设事业！”
    “又如孝，对父母要好，父母年老了，丧失劳动力了，子女难道不应该照顾父母？”
      “资产阶级的道德，精打细算，多方赚钱，难道不应该成为社会主义经营管理企业的一条重要原则。”
      “无论是封建道德，还是资产阶级道德，无产阶级都可以吸取其中某些部分，使之起本质的变化，从而为无产阶级的政治、生产服务。”
          （《说道德》，《前线》一九六二年第十期，五月二
    十五日出版）
    2、公然宣扬地主官僚的“大丈夫”精
        神，跟党和人民对抗
      “无产阶级若不善于吸取过去统治阶级某些优良的东西，甚至完全摒弃，那末，看来只有向古代的无产阶级继承，或者自己来凭空创造了。问题是在古代，无产阶级并不存在；自己凭空创造呢，也不大可能”。（注：对无产阶级的讽刺、挖苦无以复加，仇视之心，暴露无遗。）
    “在环境特别困难时，在是和非，忠和逆，正义和不义的抉择中，这些历史人物（包括文天祥在内）都牺牲或者敢于牺牲自己的生命，保持了孟子所说的大丈夫的品德。这些人物虽然都是地主，都是官僚，但是，在和恶势力斗争中，他们却都是大丈夫。”
      “从这些封建时代的言论和人物的表现中，对照我们无产阶级的道德标准，不是可以看到道德是可以批判地继承么！”
          （《再说道德》，《前线》一九六二年第十六期，八
        月二十五日出版）
    3、企图复活地主阶级的教育，毒害新
       中国的青少年
      “《三字经》是本好书，可惜已经被冷落了几十年，没有人去理会它了。”
      “说是好书，因为这本小书是旧时代普及知识的读物，内容涉及面非常广泛，……从这本书编纂以来，公元十三世纪后期一直到二十世纪初期，七百多年来，成为儿童启蒙的必读书，发生了深远的广泛的影响。”
      （《三字经》）“就旧时代所有的书来说，是一部最短的书，但是内容却非常丰富，……是一本小型百科全书，评价都是很高的。”
      “说它是小型中国通史，因为作者用极简练的手法，把历史上王朝的兴衰更迭都说清楚了。”
          （《谈〈三字经〉》，《前线》一九六二年第一期，
    一月十日出版）
    4、胡说封建王朝修史“是我们国家的
       好传统”，公然要求我们为反动统
        治阶级修史立传
      “任何一个王朝初起时，要办的大事之一，便是组织编写力量，建立史馆，总结前朝的经验，以国家的名义，颁布或刊印前朝的断代史。这个好办法，尽管王朝不断更替，却一直被保存下来，是我们国家的好传统，也是历史特征之一。”
      “设想组织对祖国历史研究有经验的专门家若干人，带上几十个或更多的大学历史系毕业的高材生，大家一起来阅读，整理，研究，分析、总结史料，化上十年八年时间，在较长的实践中，专门家的队伍不是就建成了吗？”
    “以后再用十年八年时间写，十年八年时间改，我们时代的清史、民国史是可以写成，而且可以写好的。（明史修了一百多年，用二三十年的时间修清史，决不算多。）”
          （《论修清史》，《前线》一九六三年第三期，二月
    十日出版）
    “中国是最富有历史传统的国家，不但各个朝代的历史没有中断过，而且各种体裁的历史，也是万紫千红，开遍于广阔无垠的历史园地。特别是地方志，从《越绝书》到现在，内容有省志、府志、县志、镇志、山志、庙志、学校志、机关志等等，除了散佚的以外，保存到今天的，还有七八千种之多。这个好传统，真是值得我们自豪，应该批判地予以继承的。”

          十一月二十五日出版）
    5、顽固地保护帝王将相霸占舞台，反
       对工农兵成为舞台的主人
      “一个现代剧目创作出来了，上演了，大家都来欣赏、议论一番：质量高不高，思想性如何，是否能够站得住等等，特别是艺术性怎么样，更为人们所注意，而且大家会很自然地拿它来和传统剧目比一比。于是议论纷纭，说好的，说坏的，说差不多的都有。这种现象当然是正常的。”
    “在马克思主义的文艺批评标准面前，任何剧目都是平等的，现代剧目也好，传统剧目也好，我们应该一视同仁，都要严格要求。”
      （现代剧目）“是否能保留下来，最终到底还得靠剧目本身，不能依靠主观的捧场和保驾。”

    “在三击掌（注：这是一出宣扬反动封建道德的坏戏。）这出戏里，写她（注：指戏中人物王宝钏。）和父亲王允的斗争，倒有点骨气，还有可取之处。”
    “我国的戏剧遗产是无比丰富的。有完全适合今天需要的好戏，也有必须禁演的坏戏，这两部分在整个旧剧目中都占少数，而大量的是精华和糟粕并存”。

    6、用“读书”“成名”“升级”等作
       钓饵，为“三家村”黑店搜罗信徒
      “‘读书百遍，其义自见。’这话是有道理的。有的书必须多读，特别是学习古典文，那些范文最好是能够读到可以背诵的程度。除了多读之外，还得多抄，把重点、关键性的词句抄下来，时时翻阅，这样便可以记得牢靠，成为自己的东西了。多读多抄，这个二多是必须保证的。”

      “历史上有不少穷困的农民、穷人，发愤图强，克服困难，顽强学习，成为著名的学者。”
      “后汉桓荣年轻时和哥哥元卿在田里做活，一到休息时候，桓荣便打开书本，朗诵起来。哥哥笑他，白费气力讨苦吃，中什么用？后来桓荣成为学者，哥哥才叹口气说，象我们这样农民，那能知道念书有这样好处呢！”

       骋的自由天地”，露骨地推行“和
       平演变”的阴谋
      “兴趣是什么？是个人的爱好。……就生活爱好说，有的爱画画，有的爱唱歌，有的喜爱体育活动，有的爱跳舞，有的爱钓鱼，有的爱打桥牌，如此等等。”
    “通过实践，第二兴趣，工作中的兴趣不是便培养出来了吗？而且这第二兴趣并不妨碍第一兴趣，（注：“三家村”的第一兴趣除了密谋策划进行反党反社会主义活动外，就是吃喝玩乐，谈猫说狗，捧地主，玩古董，打麻将，做买卖，追求苏联修正主义知识分子的一套。这就是“三家村”的兴趣。）你依然可以保持文学的爱好，业余时间是第一兴趣广泛驰骋的自由天地”。
