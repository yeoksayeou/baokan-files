　　Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: Capital medical and health workers held a forum on May 16, unmasking Deng Tuo, the owner of the "Three-Family Village" black inn, who under the guise of writing "medical and health" knowledge, was actually engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

　　Huang Jiasi, President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, who has been engaged in medical work for decades, Xi Peiling, a 70-year-old veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctor, Lü Weibai, Deputy Director of the Infectious Disease Research Laboratory of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, who studied traditional Chinese medicine, Li Jiatai, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, and a young doctor, all spoke at the forum. They said that in the two black books, "Three-Family Village Notes" and "Yanshan Night Talks," in addition to the notorious "Special Treatment for 'Amnesia'," there are also many so-called "medical" essays such as "On 'Health Preservation'," "The Theory of 'Getting Heated' in Traditional Chinese Medicine," and "Sanqi, Shanqi, and Tianqi." Did Deng Tuo write these "medical" essays out of concern for the people's health and to disseminate medical and health knowledge? Absolutely not. These articles are pretending to talk about medicine, but are actually talking about politics; pretending to introduce health knowledge, but are actually engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. They are all anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds.

　　  Deng Tuo pretends to be an expert,
   Talking about medicine is fake, talking about politics
   is real, his intention is to attack
   the Party, attack the Great Leap Forward
　　They said that whether it is modern medicine or traditional Chinese medicine, amnesia is only a symptom, and there has never been a disease called "amnesia." Deng Tuo's nonsense based on this fabricated disease name, such as "going back on one's words," "being untrustworthy," "feigning madness," and "being unreliable," are clearly political terms that viciously attack the Party and socialism, and have nothing to do with medicine at all. As for his idea of "pouring dog blood over the head" and "using a specially made stick to hit the patient's head to cause 'shock'," this is completely ulterior motive and nakedly exposes his deep class hatred for the Party and socialism. Deng Tuo blatantly asked our Party in the article to "say nothing," "do nothing," and "completely rest," which even more clearly exposes his sinister purpose of opposing the Party and socialism.

　　In his article "Sanqi, Shanqi, and Tianqi," Deng Tuo said that if sanqi, a kind of medicine, "is used inappropriately, a little too much, it will cause problems," and "if it exceeds the limit, it will become absurd and immediately kill the patient," and "this principle is like the law of motion of other things." Lü Weibai exposed Deng Tuo's black talk in his speech. He said: Sanqi is a very mild medicine, and even if the dosage is slightly larger, it will not cause problems at all, and exceeding the dosage by much will never cause death. Deng Tuo's pretense of being an expert in discussing sanqi is intended to attack "other things," that is, to attack the Great Leap Forward, in the name of sanqi. In his article "The Theory of 'Getting Heated' in Traditional Chinese Medicine," Deng Tuo talked a lot of black talk such as "getting heated," "having a fever," "being capricious," and "being willful and indulgent," and also said that among the various causes of "getting heated," "the trouble lies in deficiency," etc., all of which are vicious insinuations and attacks on the Great Leap Forward. These curses are completely in the same tune as the attacks of right-leaning opportunists and Khrushchev revisionists on our Great Leap Forward. These slanders have long been shattered by ironclad facts and are not worth refuting. When criticizing Deng Tuo's article "On 'Health Preservation'," Lü Weibai said: Deng Tuo promoted "purity of heart and few desires" and "nurturing natural life with the way of nature" in this article, which is to wear down the fighting will of our people in the three major revolutionary movements and to disarm people spiritually. It is a very sinister and poisonous anesthetic. Lü Weibai said that we must hold high the great red banner of the general line of socialist construction, and like the people of Daqing and Dazhai, work hard and change the world; we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the revolution through to the end, and defeat all demons and monsters. Deng Tuo wants us not to "get heated." We say, no! This kind of "heat" must be "on." Since this fire was lit by your own hands, and since you must oppose the Party and oppose socialism, the anger of the people of the whole country must burn your "Three-Family Village" black shop to ashes.

　　Wu Linpeng and Wang Hongtu, teachers at the Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said: Among the so-called "medical" essays written by Deng Tuo, "Special Treatment for 'Amnesia'" is the most vicious one. In this article, Deng Tuo gritted his teeth and nakedly exposed his hideous face of opposing the Party and socialism. It is particularly worth noting that this big poisonous weed was thrown out in the theoretical journal "Frontline" of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. We want to ask, what position does "Frontline" stand on, and whose mouthpiece is it? Chen Mingzhe, a doctor at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College, Zhang Dengyao, head nurse of the Affiliated Hospital of Beijing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and others rebuked "Frontline" and said, like the "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News," you are standing on the front line of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat. In recent years, you have released a large number of poisonous weeds, which have spread widely and caused great harm. Now that you have been caught by the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, you cannot get away with it.

　　  The brilliant achievements of New China's medical and health
   undertakings cannot be obliterated by
   anyone
　　Many medical workers at the meeting listed the brilliant achievements made in China's medical and health undertakings over the past seventeen years, and refuted Deng Tuo's fallacies that the Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "exaggerating" with ironclad facts. Huang Jiasi said that the achievements of New China's medical and health undertakings cannot be obliterated by anyone. Many diseases that seriously endangered the people's health before liberation have been basically eliminated or brought under control; many drugs that used to rely on imports can now be produced in our country; the treatment effect of large-area burns, the success of limb replantation, the development of cardiac surgery, and the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in the treatment of fractures and cataracts have all been highly praised internationally. After various places implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of focusing on rural areas for health work, the rural health conditions have been further changed. Sun Zhenhuan, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, said at the meeting that traditional Chinese medicine was excluded and discriminated against everywhere in old China, and it was the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy that gave traditional Chinese medicine a new life. Since liberation, medical, teaching, and research institutions such as traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine colleges, and traditional Chinese medicine research institutes have been established in various places, and a large number of traditional Chinese medicine talents have been trained, so that the motherland's medicine has been inherited and carried forward. Various places have used the method of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine to cure many difficult and complicated diseases and have achieved many major medical research results. They said that the development of medical and health undertakings is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought on the medical and health front, shining with the brilliance of the general line of socialist construction. The curses and slanders of Deng Tuo and his like against the achievements of socialist construction are like a mad dog barking at the sun, and cannot harm the sun's light in the slightest.

　　  The Party cares about the
   health of the working people infinitely, Deng Tuo's
   slander that the Party "does not cherish labor
   power" is all nonsense
　　Many workers, nurses, and doctors from medical and research units at the meeting compared their personal experiences in the old and new societies, refuting Deng Tuo's nonsense that the Party "despises the masses" and "does not cherish labor power." Wang Ruolan, a nurse at Ping'an Hospital, said that in the old society, the hospital gate opened to the south, and if you were sick and had no money, don't come in. At that time, how many working people could afford to live in a hospital or hire a doctor when they got sick? Only after liberation has the health of the working people been given meticulous care by the Party and the state. Many workers and peasants who were tortured all over their bodies in the old society have recovered their health after liberation; many blind farmers have regained their sight in the new society. Recently, an earthquake occurred in the Xingtai area of Hebei Province, and the Party and the government immediately sent a large number of medical personnel to the disaster area to rescue the wounded, while continuously transporting food and supplies, so that the production and life in the disaster area quickly recovered. Ask Deng Tuo: which dynasty or generation in the past has cared for "labor power" like this? Xu Tao, attending physician of Dongdan Hospital, said that the Party called on us to go to the countryside, factories, government offices, and neighborhoods to deliver medical treatment and medicine to people's doors, which just reflects the Party's infinite care for the broad masses of working people. He said that during his mobile medical service in the countryside, he personally saw many peasant brothers say "Thank you, Communist Party, thank you, Chairman Mao" as soon as their diseases were cured. This shows how much the broad masses of working people love the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Li Fumin and Li Yunfu, workers at the Biological Products Testing Institute, who suffered from unemployment and hunger in the old society, said that it is really the landlords, capitalists, and bourgeois officials like Deng Tuo who are lazy in their limbs and do not know the five grains who despise the masses. You representatives of the landlord and capitalist classes sit in the houses built by our workers, write articles and scripts, talk nonsense, and specialize in anti-Party and anti-people activities. We will never agree. We will use the wheels of the Great Leap Forward to crush your conspiracies to pieces.

### 首都医药卫生工作者揭开邓拓的画皮  借介绍“卫生知识”之名  行反党反社会主义之实

    首都医药卫生工作者揭开邓拓的画皮
    借介绍“卫生知识”之名
    行反党反社会主义之实
    新华社十九日讯　首都医药卫生工作者在五月十六日举行座谈会，揭开了“三家村”黑店掌柜邓拓以写“医药卫生”知识为名，行反党反社会主义之实的画皮。
    从事医学工作几十年的中国医学科学院院长黄家驷、七十高龄的老中医郗霈龄，学习过祖国医学的西医、中医研究院传染病研究室副主任吕维柏，学习毛主席著作积极分子、青年医生李家泰等，都在座谈会上发了言。他们说，在《三家村札记》、《燕山夜话》两部黑书里面，除了臭名昭彰的《专治“健忘症”》之外，还有《谈“养生学”》、《中医“上火”之说》、《三七、山漆和田漆》等许多篇所谓“医学”小品。邓拓写这样一些“医学”小品，是出于关心人民健康，传播医药卫生知识吗？完全不是。这些文章谈医学是假，谈政治是真，介绍卫生常识是虚，反党反社会主义是实，都是反党反社会主义的毒草。
      邓拓假充内行，
  谈医学是假，谈政治
  是真，其用意是攻击
  党，攻击大跃进
    他们说，不论是现代医学还是祖国医学，健忘都只是一种症状，从来没有“健忘症”这一病名。邓拓根据这一捏造出来的病名胡说的什么“自食其言”“言而无信”“装疯卖傻”“不堪信任”等所谓“症状”，分明是恶毒攻击党、攻击社会主义的政治术语，同医学根本扯不到一起去。至于他想出的“狗血淋头”“用一根特制的棍棒，打击病人的头部，使之‘休克’”，这根本是别有用心，赤裸裸地暴露了他对党对社会主义刻骨的阶级仇恨。邓拓在文中露骨地要我们的党“什么话都不要说”“什么事情都不能做”“完全休息”，这更是昭然若揭地供出了他反党反社会主义的阴险目的。
    邓拓在《三七、山漆和田漆》一文里说，三七这种药“用得不适当，稍稍过火，就会出乱子”，“如果超过了限度，就变成荒谬绝伦，立刻致病人于死地”，“这个道理好比其他事物运动的规律一样”。吕维柏在发言中揭穿了邓拓的这一篇黑话。他说：三七是一味很平和的药，用量稍大一些根本不会出乱子，多超过一些剂量也决不会致死。邓拓假充内行地议论三七，其用意是借三七之名攻击“其他事物”，也就是攻击大跃进。邓拓在《中医“上火”之说》一文里说了一大堆什么“上火”、“发热”、“喜怒无常”、“任性放纵”等黑话，还说在各种“上火”的原因中，“麻烦的在于虚亏”等等，这都是对大跃进的恶毒的影射和攻击。这些咒骂同右倾机会主义分子和赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子对我们大跃进的攻击，完全是一个调子。这些诬蔑早已在铁的事实面前碰得头破血流，不值一驳了。吕维柏在批判邓拓的《谈“养生学”》一文时说：邓拓在这篇文章里宣扬什么“清心寡欲”，“以自然之道，养自然之生”，这是为了消磨我国人民在三大革命运动中的斗争意志，要人们在精神上解除武装，是一服十分阴险毒辣的麻醉剂。吕维柏说，我们就是要高举社会主义建设总路线的伟大红旗，象大庆人、大寨人那样艰苦奋斗，改天换地；就是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把革命进行到底，斗倒一切牛鬼蛇神。邓拓要我们不要“上火”。我们说，不行！这种“火”一定要“上”。这一把火既然由你们亲手点起来，既然你们一定要反党反社会主义，全国人民的怒火一定要把你们这个“三家村”黑店烧成灰烬。
    北京中医学院教师吴林鹏、王洪图说：在邓拓写的所谓“医学”小品里，《专治“健忘症”》是最恶毒的一篇。邓拓在这篇文章里咬牙切齿，赤裸裸地暴露了他反党反社会主义的狰狞面目。特别值得注意的是，这棵大毒草是在中共北京市委的理论刊物《前线》上抛出来的。我们要问，《前线》是站在什么立场，是谁的喉舌？北京医学院第三附属医院医师陈明哲、北京中医学院附属医院护士长张登瑶等斥责《前线》说，你们同《北京日报》和《北京晚报》一样，是站在资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的前线，几年来你们放了大量毒草，流毒极广，危害极大。现在你们被用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众揪住了，要想蒙混过关是办不到的。
      新中国医药卫生
  事业的辉煌成就，任
  何人也抹煞不了
    许多医务工作者在会上列举了十七年来我国医药卫生事业取得的辉煌成就，以铁的事实驳斥了邓拓所谓大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”的谰言。黄家驷说，新中国医药卫生事业的成就是任何人也抹煞不了的。许多在解放前严重危害人民健康的疾病已基本消灭或得到控制；许多过去依赖进口的药品现在我国能够自己生产了；大面积烧伤的治疗效果、断肢再植的成功、心脏外科的发展、中西医结合治疗骨折和白内障等等，都在国际上得到了很高的评价。各地执行了党中央关于把卫生工作的重点放到农村的方针以后，进一步改变了农村卫生面貌。中医孙振寰在会上说，中医在旧中国到处受到排斥、歧视，是党的中医政策使中医得到新生。解放以来，各地成立了中医医院、中医学院、中医研究院等医疗、教学和科研机构，培养了大批中医人材，使祖国医学得到了继承和发扬。各地用中西医结合的方法，治好了许多疑难病症，并且取得了许多重大的医学研究成果。他们说，医药卫生事业的发展，是毛泽东思想在医药卫生战线上的胜利，闪烁着社会主义建设总路线的光辉。邓拓之流对社会主义建设成就的咒骂、诬蔑，就象狂犬吠日，一点也不能损害太阳的光芒。
      党对劳动人民的
  健康无比关怀，邓拓
  污蔑党“不爱护劳动
  力”全是鬼话
    不少医疗、研究单位的工人、护士和医生在会上以新旧社会的亲身经历作对比，驳斥了邓拓诬蔑党“看不起群众”“不爱护劳动力”的鬼话。平安医院护士王若兰说，在旧社会，医院大门朝南开，有病没钱别进来，那时候有几个劳动人民得了病住得起医院，请得起医生？只有在解放后，劳动人民的健康才得到了党和国家的无微不至的关怀。许多在旧社会被折磨得周身是病的工人、农民，解放后恢复了健康；许多双目失明的农民在新社会重见了光明。最近河北省邢台地区发生地震，党和政府立刻派出大批医务人员赶赴灾区抢救伤员，同时源源不断地运送食用品，使灾区的生产和生活迅速得到恢复。问问邓拓：过去那朝那代象这样爱护过“劳动力”呢？东单医院主治医生徐涛说，党号召我们下乡、下厂、下机关、下地段，送医送药上门，正好体现了党对广大劳动人民的无比关怀。他说，他在农村巡回医疗期间，亲眼看到许多农民兄弟每当治好了病，第一句话就是“感谢共产党，感谢毛主席”。这说明广大劳动人民对党中央和毛主席是多么热爱。在旧社会饱尝了失业、饥饿之苦的生物制品检定所工人李福民、李云甫等说，真正看不起群众的是地主、资本家和邓拓等四肢不勤、五谷不分的资产阶级官老爷们。你们这些地主资产阶级的代表，坐在我们工人盖的房子里，写文章、编剧本，胡说八道，专门进行反党反人民的勾当，我们决不答应。我们要用大跃进的车轮把你们的阴谋诡计碾得粉碎。
