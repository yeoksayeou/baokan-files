    Female Welder
    Worker of Luoyang First Tractor Factory, Chen Bao'an
You, growing up in bitterness,
    Serving as a beast of burden for the landlord in childhood,
Chopping wood, herding cattle, cutting weeds,
    Trampling over barren hills and desolate swamps.
At night, Mom with tears in her eyes,
    Stroking your worn-out feet:
  "Child! Don't blame your mother for being hard-hearted,
    Our ancestors have always been gourds on a bitter vine."
You never touched an embroidery needle,
    Let alone dreamed of picking up a book,
What accompanied your hands was:
    A tattered straw basket, a sickle handle.
Liberation, the Party gave you wings,
    Letting you fly under the heavens.
Holding the welding gun, crackling and popping,
    Taking the colorful threads in your hands,
Wanting to embroider new pictures for the land,
    Erecting great buildings in barren hills and wild ridges…
Light wind tidies your hair,
    Morning dew washes your cheeks,
The arc light shines brightly for thousands of miles,
    Sending words on the wind to Mom:
Daughter has a red heart and great ambition,
    Skillfully painting for the motherland…
Wind sends sound for ten thousand miles, Mom replies:
  "My daughter, my daughter!
    As long as you diligently read Chairman Mao's books,
    As long as you always listen to Chairman Mao's words,
    No matter what you do, your mother can rest assured…"

    女电焊工
    洛阳第一拖拉机厂工人  陈保安你，在苦水里泡大，小时候给地主当牛马，砍柴、放牛、割野草，踏遍荒山野洼。晚上，妈妈含着泪，抚摸着你磨破的脚丫：
  “儿啊！别怪你娘心肠硬，咱辈辈都是苦藤上的瓜。”你没摸过绣花针，更莫想把书本拿，和你的手作伴的是：一只破草筐，一个镰刀把。解放了，党给你插上翅膀，任你飞天下。手握焊枪噼叭叭，五色彩线手中拿，要给大地绣新图，荒山野岭起大厦……轻风理头发，晨露洗面颊，弧光闪闪照千里，借风传话给妈妈：女儿心红志气大，正为祖国巧描画……风送声万里，妈妈作回答：
  “闺女呀，闺女呀！只要你勤读毛主席书，只要你常听毛主席话，不论你干啥，当娘的，心都放得下……”
