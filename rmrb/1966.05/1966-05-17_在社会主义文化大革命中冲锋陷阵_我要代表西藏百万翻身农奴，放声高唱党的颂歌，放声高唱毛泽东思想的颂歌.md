    Charging Forward in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution
    I want to represent the million emancipated serfs of Tibet and sing loudly the praises of the Party and of Mao Zedong Thought!
    Representative to the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Caidan Zhuoma
    I was extremely angered after reading the black words of Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements, exposed in the newspapers, who attack the Party and the socialist system. Can we allow Deng Tuo and his gang's black words to run rampant? No! A thousand times no! If that happened, capitalism would be restored in our country, the three major estate-holders headed by the Dalai Lama would once again ride on our heads, Tibet would once again revert to the most reactionary, darkest, most cruel, and most barbaric feudal serf system, and the million emancipated serfs would once again lose their rights as human beings.
    Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without the Communist Party, there would be no liberation of the million serfs of Tibet. Without the Communist Party, I would not have the opportunity to sing for the people of Tibet. The Chinese Communist Party has already taken root in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Anyone who妄想 (wangxiang - vainly attempts/fancifully imagines) to touch even a hair of our great Party will be bloodied!
    This time, after returning to Tibet from the interior, I saw the enormous changes that have taken place in the seven years since the Democratic Reform in Lhasa, Shannan, Rikaze and other places. Where did these changes come from? Every emancipated serf will say that it is because of the good leadership of the Party, the good leadership of Chairman Mao, and the good socialist system. However, Deng Tuo arrogantly wants our Party to "say nothing." We million serfs want to listen to the Party, and hope the Party will speak more. By listening to the Party, by listening to Chairman Mao, we overthrew the three major estate-holders, buried the feudal serf system, and are building a new socialist Tibet. We million serfs also have many words to say to our beloved Party. Deng Tuo and you small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements vainly imagine that you can stop us from listening to the Party. This is absolutely impossible!
    I am determined to defend the Party, defend socialism, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. I will charge forward in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, and will certainly not let Deng Tuo and his gang of bad guys get away, and will certainly not let any demons and monsters get away. I want to represent the million emancipated serfs of Tibet, and with all my feelings, sing loudly the praises of the Party, sing loudly the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, and together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unswervingly carry the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line, and never stop until complete victory!

    在社会主义文化大革命中冲锋陷阵
    我要代表西藏百万翻身农奴，放声高唱党的颂歌，放声高唱毛泽东思想的颂歌
    西藏自治区人民代表大会代表　才旦卓玛
    报纸上揭露的邓拓这帮反党反社会主义分子攻击党、攻击社会主义制度的黑话，我看了非常气愤。能让邓拓一伙的黑话泛滥吗？不行！一万个不行，那样一来，资本主义就要在我国复辟，以达赖为头目的三大领主就要重新骑在我们的头上，西藏就要重新恢复最反动、最黑暗、最残酷、最野蛮的封建农奴制度，百万翻身农奴就会重新丧失做人的权利。
    没有共产党，就没有新中国；没有共产党，就没有西藏百万农奴的翻身解放。没有共产党，我就没有机会为西藏人民歌唱。中国共产党已经在中国人民和世界人民心上扎下了根，谁妄想触动我们伟大党的一根毫毛，谁就会碰得头破血流！
    这次我从内地回到西藏，在拉萨、山南、日喀则等地看到了民主改革后七年的巨大变化。这变化从哪里来的呢？每一个翻身农奴都会说，这是党的领导好，毛主席的领导好，社会主义制度好。可是，邓拓却狂妄地要我们党“什么话都不要说”。我们百万农奴要听党的话，希望党多说话；我们听了党的话，听了毛主席的话，就打倒了三大领主，埋葬了封建农奴制度，建设着社会主义的新西藏。我们百万农奴也有许多话要向亲爱的党说。邓拓你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，妄想使我们不去听党的话，这绝对办不到！
    我决心捍卫党，捍卫社会主义，捍卫毛泽东思想，在社会主义文化大革命中冲锋陷阵，一定不放过邓拓这帮坏家伙，一定不放过一切牛鬼蛇神。我要代表西藏百万翻身农奴，用自己的全部感情，放声高唱党的颂歌，放声高唱毛泽东思想的颂歌，同全国工农兵一道，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地把社会主义文化大革命进行到底，彻底搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线，不获全胜，决不收兵！
