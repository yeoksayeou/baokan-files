    Adhere to Highlighting Politics and Promote a New Upsurge in Industrial Production and Construction
    --Celebrating the "May Day" International Labor Day
    Today is "May Day" International Labor Day. Our working class, while celebrating this great international festival, feels greatly encouraged by the excellent situation, both internationally and domestically.
    Currently, the revolutionary forces of the working class and laboring people worldwide are constantly growing. The national liberation movements in the vast regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the anti-imperialist revolutionary movements of the people in various countries are surging forward and developing in depth. The heroic Vietnamese people are continuously achieving new victories in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The difficulties faced by U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, with the Soviet Communist Party leadership group at its center, are growing day by day, and their situation is becoming increasingly difficult. These constitute the main current of the current international situation.
    The reactionary and decadent forces will never voluntarily withdraw from the political stage; they must and are making a desperate struggle, and even some countercurrents appear in certain places. These are only temporary phenomena. Neither U.S. imperialism nor modern revisionism can stop the historical trend of the world's people's revolutionary struggle.
    Contrary to the subjective wishes of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and lackeys, our country has more and more friends around the world, and our international prestige is getting higher and higher. We feel very honored that this year we are celebrating "May Day" together with the heroic Albanian Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Shehu, as well as friends from all continents. We would like to extend our festive congratulations and heartfelt gratitude to our distinguished guests and friends from afar.
    Domestically, whether on the economic front or the political and ideological front, there is an unprecedentedly excellent situation. To sum up, our country is currently experiencing two vigorous upsurges.
    One is the upsurge in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. With the emergence of this upsurge, a far-reaching great cultural revolution to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology is unfolding in all fields of ideology. In this upsurge, tens of thousands of worker-peasant-soldier activists have emerged, creatively studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and our most powerful weapon for defeating bourgeois and revisionist thought. Chairman Mao's books are the supreme instructions for all our work. When the broad masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, spirit transforms into matter, generating tremendous power for class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiments. The emergence of this upsurge shows that the consciousness of the broad masses of our people is increasing day by day, and the power of Mao Zedong Thought is becoming greater and greater. This is an event of great historical significance in the political life of our people.
    The other upsurge is the new upsurge in production and construction. This upsurge is primarily a result of the previous one. By studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works and highlighting politics, people understand why they work and why they live, knowing that all work is for the revolution. Therefore, people's strength is doubled, and production is doubled. Currently, our industrial front is in a scene of prosperity. In the first quarter of this year, many places and many enterprises have seen production growth that far exceeds the level of the same period last year. In many places and many enterprises, the variety of products is increasing, and the quality has significantly improved.
    Mass technological innovation and technological revolution are developing daily. In the struggle to catch up with and surpass advanced levels, many places and many enterprises have highlighted the word "surpass" and achieved great success, with many new designs, new technologies, new materials, new processes, and new equipment emerging. Many places and many enterprises have made many new contributions in vigorously supporting agriculture, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, actively supporting national defense, and ensuring key national construction projects.
    The situation on the agricultural front is also very good. Significant achievements have been made in farmland water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. The area of stable and high-yield farmland has increased, creating conditions for striving for another good harvest this year. Some places have won victories in the fight against drought. Currently, the vast land of our country is a scene of prosperous and busy spring plowing and sowing.
    Faced with the current excellent situation, how can we ensure that the new upsurge in production and construction continues to develop healthily and even more vigorously? The fundamental key is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, and advance bravely under the brilliant illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    To highlight politics on the industrial front, we must resolutely implement the line of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. This means adhering to putting politics in command, not "technology determines everything"; adhering to the division of labor under the leadership of the Party committee, not the "one-man leadership" system; adhering to launching mass movements, "from the masses, to the masses," instead of relying on a few so-called "experts" to run enterprises; implementing technological democracy, opposing technological monopoly; emancipating the mind, breaking down the metaphysical and trivial philosophical rules and regulations of the bourgeoisie, and breaking down all the "frames" stipulated by so-called bourgeois authoritative experts and scholars, whether they are "foreign frames" or "old frames," constantly carrying out technological revolution, daring to exceed the technical level of capitalist countries; transforming those bourgeois experts so that they serve socialism, while training more proletarian experts who are both red and expert with Mao Zedong Thought; and regarding the creation of an industrial army that is extremely proletarianized and extremely combative as the most important task of enterprise revolutionization. In this way, we can prevent the spread of revisionist thought, ensure that socialist enterprises never change their nature, and produce more and better products.
    Highlighting politics and running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought requires a process of repeated practice and struggle. Therefore, after the new upsurge in production and construction on the industrial front, it is still necessary to creatively study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works in light of the actual situation of the enterprise, oppose various bourgeois and revisionist thoughts, learn from the People's Liberation Army, implement the "four firsts," carry forward the "three-eight" working style, extensively and deeply develop the mass movement of learning from Daqing, creating "five-goods", comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, and extensively carry out mass technological innovation and technological revolution.
    Political work should first promote the ideological revolutionization of people, and at the same time, closely combine it with some major issues in the new upsurge of industrial production and construction, and effectively carry out political work in production and construction, so that politics can better play the role of commander, soul, and lifeline.
    What issues should be paid special attention to in the current new upsurge of industrial production and construction? In general, we should pay attention to combining a high degree of revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude. The better the situation, the more we should be modest and prudent, and the more we should see shortcomings and defects. In all work, we must firmly follow the mass line, fully promote democracy, pay special attention to listening to different opinions, pay attention to listening to the different opinions of the majority, and also pay attention to the different opinions of the minority.
    To achieve this, we should earnestly implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on democratic centralism. This is a very important issue in highlighting politics in the current industrial leading organs and industrial enterprises, and it is a very important content of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.
    To implement democratic centralism in enterprises, the primary issue is that the Party committee leadership should improve the Party's democratic life, form a revolutionary leadership core, fully promote democracy, and strengthen collective leadership. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the system of workers' representative congresses, truly achieve political democracy, production democracy, and life democracy, and truly rely on the masses to run enterprises.
    The leader of an enterprise must have the scientific attitude of dividing one into two, finding shortcomings after winning victories. He should listen to both correct and incorrect words, good and bad words, and analyze them so that there is more dialectics and less metaphysics in our minds.
    In the upsurge of production and construction, there will often be some problems. For these problems, is it better to make decisions arbitrarily without investigation or research, or to solve problems after going to the mass line and understanding the situation in many ways? Practice has proved that more consultation leads to better decisions. On the basis of highly promoting democracy, a high degree of centralization can be implemented. In this way, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and workers can be better mobilized, and the new upsurge of industrial production and construction can be continuously promoted forward.
    In the new upsurge of industrial production and construction, we must also adhere to the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, with "better" being the priority.
    Our production and construction must be greater, faster, better, and more economical, as stipulated by the Party's general line for socialist construction. How can we achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results? Years of practice have proved that to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must prioritize "better" and quality first.
    In order to achieve "better" being the priority and quality first, it is not a problem to take corresponding measures in production technology. However, more importantly, we must look at this issue from a political perspective and recognize "better" being the priority and quality first at the height of the Party's general line for socialist construction.
    The fundamental purpose of our socialist production and construction is for the benefit of the people. This is the greatest advantage of the socialist system. Our production and construction should not only be large in quantity, but also good in quality. The good quality we are talking about is not for the sake of quality, but that it can meet our needs and solve our problems. Experience has proved that the relationship between quality and quantity is a dialectical one. If you relax quality and only pursue quantity, the quantity will eventually not increase; if you pursue quality for the sake of quality, not only will the quantity not increase, but the quality will not improve either. The objective law is that the more you want quantity, the better the quality must be. Only with good quality can there be a large quantity. The characteristics of the current new upsurge in industrial production and construction in our country illustrate this principle. It is not only reflected in quantity and speed, but more importantly, in quality and variety. Under the current circumstances, implementing the principle of prioritizing "better" and quality first is an important factor in making the new upsurge of industrial production and construction continue to develop.
    In the new upsurge of industrial production and construction, we must also adhere to the policies and guidelines repeatedly put forward by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong: combining work and rest, ensuring safe production, and caring for the lives of the masses.
    In many places and many enterprises, under the current excellent situation, under the influence of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works extensively, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and workers have been unprecedentedly high. We should support and commend this revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and guide this enthusiasm to the correct path. At the same time, we must also do a good job of combining work and rest, ensuring safe production, and caring for the lives of the masses in accordance with the Party's policies and guidelines.
    The better the situation, the higher the upsurge, the more important it is to cherish and care for the enthusiasm of the masses. This is very important politics.
    While celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day, with our hearts in our motherland and our eyes on the world, what we see is an excellent revolutionary situation. However, we must not be complacent in the slightest. We must see that there are still shortcomings in our work and that our progress is not enough. We must highlight politics, go all out, maximize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, take Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, and advance victoriously in the three great

    坚持突出政治，促进工业生产建设的新高潮
    ——庆祝“五一”国际劳动节
    今天是“五一”国际劳动节。我国的工人阶级在欢庆这个伟大的国际节日的时候，感到十分振奋的是：不论是国际方面，还是国内方面，都是一派大好形势。
    现在，全世界工人阶级和劳动人民的革命力量正在不断壮大，亚非拉广大地区的民族解放运动和各国人民的反帝革命运动汹涌澎湃，并且正在深入发展。英雄的越南人民不断取得抗美救国斗争的新胜利。美帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的困难，一天比一天大，日子越来越不好过。这些，就是当前国际形势的主流。
    反动的腐朽的势力绝不会自动退出政治舞台，它们一定要而且正在作垂死挣扎，甚至在某些地方出现某些逆流。这都是暂时的现象。不管是美帝国主义，还是现代修正主义，都不可能阻挡世界人民革命斗争的历史潮流。
    同美帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗们的主观愿望相反，我国在全世界的朋友越来越多，我国的国际威望越来越高。我们感到十分荣幸的是，今年同我们在一起欢度“五一”节的，有以谢胡同志为首的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚的党政代表团，以及来自世界各大洲的朋友们，我们谨向来自远方的贵宾们、朋友们，致以节日的祝贺和衷心的谢意。
    在国内方面，不论在经济战线，还是政治思想战线，都是一片前所未有的大好形势。概括起来说，当前，我们的国家出现了两个气势磅礴的高潮。
    一个是学习和运用毛泽东思想的高潮。随着这个高潮的出现，在意识形态的各个领域内，正在展开一场意义深远的兴无灭资的文化大革命。在这个高潮中，出现了成千上万的工农兵积极分子，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是我们战胜资产阶级思想和修正主义思想的最强大武器。毛主席的书是我们一切工作的最高指示。广大群众掌握了毛泽东思想，精神变物质，对阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，都产生了巨大的力量。这个高潮的出现，说明我国广大群众的觉悟日益提高，毛泽东思想的威力越来越大。这是我国人民政治生活中的一个有伟大历史意义的事件。
    另一个高潮是生产建设的新高潮。这个高潮首先是由于前一高潮而来的。学习毛泽东同志的著作，突出政治，人们知道了为什么而工作、为什么而生活，知道了一切工作都是为了革命。所以人们的力量倍增，生产倍增。当前，我国的工业战线，正处在一片兴旺的景象之中。今年第一季度，许多地方，许多企业，生产的增长，都大大超过了去年同期的水平。许多地方、许多企业，产品的品种日益增多，质量有了显著的提高。
    群众性的技术革新、技术革命日益开展。许多地方、许多企业在赶超先进水平的斗争中，突出了“超”字，取得了很大成绩，出现了不少新设计、新技术、新材料、新工艺和新设备。许多地方，许多企业在大力支援农业、巩固工农联盟，在积极支援国防，保证国家重点建设等方面，都作出了许多新的贡献。
    在农业战线上形势也很好。去冬今春的农田水利建设，取得了很大的成绩，稳产高产的农田增加了，为争取今年再有一个好收成，创造了条件。一些地方在抗旱斗争中打了胜仗。当前，在我国广大土地上，正是一片欣欣向荣的繁忙的春耕播种景象。
    面对着当前的大好形势，怎样使生产建设的新高潮，持续地、更加健康地向前发展呢？根本的一环，就是高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，奋勇前进。
    在工业战线上突出政治，就必须坚决贯彻按毛泽东思想办企业的路线。这就是说，要坚持政治挂帅，而不是什么“技术决定一切”；要坚持党委领导下的分工负责制，而不是什么“一长制”；要坚持大搞群众运动，“从群众中来，到群众中去”，而不是依靠少数所谓“专家”来办企业；要实行技术民主，反对技术垄断；要解放思想，破除资产阶级的形而上学和烦琐哲学的规章制度，要破所谓资产阶级权威专家、学者所规定的一切“框框”，不管它是“洋框框”还是“旧框框”，不断进行技术革命，敢于超过资本主义国家的技术水平；要改造那些资产阶级专家，使他们为社会主义服务，同时要培养更多的具有毛泽东思想的、又红又专的无产阶级专家；要把造就一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的产业大军，作为企业革命化的最重要的任务。这样，才能使我们防止修正主义思想泛滥，保证社会主义企业永不变质，生产出更多更好的产品。
    突出政治，按照毛泽东思想办企业，需要经过一个反复实践的斗争过程。因此，在工业战线上生产建设新高潮兴起之后，仍然要结合本企业的实际，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，反对各种各样的资产阶级思想和修正主义的思想，以解放军为榜样，实行四个第一，发扬三八作风，广泛深入地开展学大庆、创五好的比学赶帮超的群众运动，广泛开展群众性的技术革新、技术革命。
    政治工作首先要促进人们思想革命化，同时紧密结合工业生产建设新高潮中的一些重大的问题，把政治工作切实做到生产建设中去，使政治更好地起统帅作用、灵魂作用和生命线作用。
    在当前工业生产建设新高潮中，应当特别注意那些问题呢？总的来说，应当注意把高度的革命精神和严格的科学态度结合起来。形势越好，越要谦虚谨慎，越要看到不足之处，看到缺点。在一切工作中都要坚定地走群众路线，充分发扬民主，特别注意倾听不同的意见，要注意倾听多数人的不同意见，而且要注意少数人的不同意见。
    要做到这一点，就应当切实地贯彻执行党中央和毛泽东同志关于民主集中制的指示。这是当前工业领导机关和工业企业中突出政治一个十分重要的问题，是按照毛泽东思想办企业的一个十分重要的内容。
    在企业中贯彻实行民主集中制，首要的问题是党委领导机关要健全党的民主生活，形成一个革命化的领导核心，充分发扬民主，加强集体领导。其次，要健全职工代表大会制度，真正做到发扬政治民主，生产民主，生活民主，真正做到依靠群众办企业。
    一个企业的领导人，必须具有打了胜仗找缺点的一分为二的科学态度，对于正确的话，错误的话，好话，坏话，都要听听，都要分析分析，这样，可以使我们的头脑中多一点辩证法，少一点形而上学。
    在生产建设高潮中，经常会出现这样那样的一些问题。对于这些问题，是不调查、不研究，独断专行好呢，还是多走群众路线，多方面了解情况后解决问题好呢？实践证明，多谋才能善断。在高度发扬民主的基础上，才能实行高度的集中。这样，才能更好地调动广大干部和工人群众的积极性，把工业的生产建设新高潮，不断地向前推进。
    在工业生产建设新高潮中，还要坚持多快好省、好字当头的方针。
    我们的生产建设必须是多快好省的，这是党的社会主义建设总路线所规定了的。怎样才能达到又多又快又好又省呢？多年来的实践证明，要多快好省，就必须好字当头，质量第一。
    为了实现好字当头，质量第一，在生产技术上要采取相适应的措施，这是没有问题的。然而，更重要的是，要从政治上去看这个问题，把好字当头、质量第一，提到党的社会主义建设总路线的高度来认识。
    我们的社会主义的生产建设，其根本目的，是为了人民的利益。这是社会主义制度最大的优越性。我们的生产建设，不但要数量多，而且要质量好。我们所说的质量好，不是为质量而质量，而是它能满足我们的用项，能解决我们的问题。经验证明：质量和数量的关系是辩证的关系，如果你放松了质量，只追求数量，结果数量终于也上不去；如果你为质量而质量，不但数量上不去，质量也不会提高。客观规律是，越要数量多，就越要质量好，只有质量好，才能数量多。目前我国工业生产建设新高潮的特征说明了这一道理，它不仅仅表现在数量和速度方面，而且更重要地表现在质量和品种方面。在目前情况下，贯彻好字当头、质量第一的方针，是使工业生产建设新高潮持续不断向前发展的一个重要因素。
    在工业生产建设的新高潮中，还要坚持执行党中央和毛泽东同志一再提出的：劳逸结合、安全生产、关心群众生活等方针政策。
    许多地方、许多企业单位在当前的大好形势下，在大学毛泽东同志著作的影响下，广大干部和工人群众的政治积极性和生产积极性都空前高涨。我们应当支持、表扬干部和群众的这种革命积极性，并且把这种积极性，引导到正确的道路上去。同时，我们还要按照党的方针政策，切实做好劳逸结合、安全生产和关心群众生活。
    形势越好，高潮越高，越要珍视和爱护群众的积极性。这是很重要的政治。
    在庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，看到的是一片大好的革命形势。然而，我们丝毫不能自满，一定要看到我们工作中还有缺点，我们的进步还不够。我们一定要突出政治，鼓足干劲，最大限度地调动广大群众的积极性，以毛泽东思想挂帅，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动中，乘胜前进。同时我们还要戒骄戒躁，坚决走群众路线，严格贯彻执行党的路线、方针、政策，把革命精神和科学态度更好地结合起来。这样，我们就一定能够不断促进生产建设的新高潮，为第三个五年计划的第一年作出更大的贡献！为支援世界人民的革命斗争作出更大的贡献！（附图片）
