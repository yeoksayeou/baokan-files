    "Stage Sisters" is a Poisonous Arrow Shot from the Black Line
    Shanghai Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory Film and Drama Criticism Group
    After watching the movie "Stage Sisters," some comrades said: "This film smells awful! It's exactly the same path and tone as the movies that Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Yang Hansheng made before Liberation." We think this is very true. This film, under the guise of charm, uses subtle techniques to vigorously promote bourgeois individual struggle, and extensively publicizes bourgeois human nature theory. It is a product of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. It is a poisonous arrow combining the "thirties" literature and art, bourgeois literary thought, and modern revisionist literary thought.
    Promoting Individual Struggle, Praising Erroneous Lines
    The protagonists of the films of the 1930s were mostly intellectuals from the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie, mostly "heroes" of individual struggle. The authors sang praises for their victories in individual struggle and complained loudly about their setbacks or failures. This kind of bourgeois individual struggle was already reactionary in the 1930s, and today, in the 1960s, it has become an object of socialist revolution. However, those who are dissatisfied with socialism are still trying to peddle this rotten black merchandise of individual struggle. The protagonist of the film "Stage Sisters," Zhu Chunhua, is a typical example of individual struggle carefully crafted by them.
    In the film, Zhu Chunhua is depicted as a "good person" who is not tempted by profit, does not admire vanity, and is "clean and upright," a "hero" who is not afraid of the strong, does not suffer humiliation, and dares to resist. When the theater manager Tang wanted Zhu Chunhua and her colleagues to perform "Widow Ma Opens a Shop," he begged in a low voice, but Zhu Chunhua refused outright. When the female gangster Shen's mother wanted to take her as a kept woman, offering brand-new costumes, she ignored her. When the local ruffian Shaoxing Abing asked her to sing at a wealthy family's gathering to make some easy money, she refused to do so. After the Yue opera queen Shang Shuihua committed suicide by hanging, she dared to come forward and fight. When Pan and others threatened her with bullets, she dismissed it with a smile and continued to perform her "Blessing." What made her "dare to act"? In a word, it was by relying on her "clean and upright living and serious acting," by relying on her individual hard work. The writers and directors tell us: as long as you rely on individual struggle and become famous, you will have a backer, capital, and everything; you can do whatever you want, and no one can touch a hair on your head; you can maintain your "human rights," "dignity," and "freedom," and not be bound by "anyone," nor be oppressed and bullied by "anyone." The film's writers and directors not only prominently rendered Zhu Chunhua's "heroic" behavior of individual struggle, but also enthusiastically praised Zhu Chunhua's "victory" of individual struggle. Look, Zhu Chunhua refused to perform "Widow Ma Opens a Shop," and Manager Tang could do nothing about it; she refused to sing at the wealthy family's gathering, and Shaoxing Abing could not do anything to her; she wanted to occupy the theater, and Manager Tang had to agree; she wanted to perform the new play "Blessing," and the likes of Pan had no way to stop her. The writers and directors also pretended to write a little about so-called "persecution," such as the banning of "Blessing," and Pan and Manager Tang instructing the monk A Xin to harm her secretly, etc., but the purpose was to praise her victory in individual struggle. Look, the reactionary court is not a place to cover up their evil deeds; on the contrary, Zhu Chunhua has become a spiritual judge, and her "generous statement" makes the judge at a loss and declares the conspiracy of Pan and Manager Tang bankrupt. Departing from the leadership of the Party, departing from the struggle of the broad masses, relying only on individual, lone-wolf struggle can easily defeat the enemy and win one victory after another. This is the conclusion that the writers and directors tell us.
    This is completely deceptive. The background of the film is from 1935 to 1950, which was an era of intense national struggle and class struggle, an era of the broad masses launching magnificent struggles under the leadership of the Party. The film avoids the fierce revolutionary storm and misrepresents a feud between sisters and the various entanglements caused by it as class struggle, which is wrong in itself. On this basis, the film's writers and directors further promote the view that this kind of
  "class struggle" can be won by relying solely on Zhu Chunhua's individual struggle. We know that any victory in class struggle is inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses. This kind of victory can never be achieved by relying on individual strength, nor can it be easily defeated by the reactionary forces with a few painless words and a few boos from the masses, as in the movie Zhu Chunhua at the reactionary court. The "struggle" of Zhu Chunhua, who is praised in the film, to realize her highest ideal—"to act with her head held high on the stage and to be an upright person off the stage"—is purely an individual struggle, which is completely different from the organized class struggle of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party; in order to beautify Zhu Chunhua, the film even depicts the broad masses as numb and indifferent, detached from the struggle, doing everything possible to uglify them. Can such a struggle be victorious?
    What also needs to be emphasized here is that the film, through Zhu Chunhua's "heroic" story, shows that this kind of reckless and adventurous struggle is correct and can be victorious. In this way, of course, there is no need for a correct political line. In the past decade or so, "Stage Sisters" is by no means the only film that specializes in praising erroneous lines.
    Promoting Bourgeois Human Nature and Human Sentiment Cancels Class Struggle
    The film also vigorously promotes bourgeois human nature and human sentiment, talking at length about "sisterly feelings," "father-daughter feelings," and "master-apprentice feelings," attempting to make people believe that as long as there is "real feeling" between people, any problem can be solved. This is especially reflected in the relationship between Zhu Chunhua and Xing Yuehong. After the two sisters came to Shanghai to perform and become famous, Xing Yuehong, because of her own "worthlessness," betrayed her father's will to "live cleanly and act seriously" and embarked on a path of depravity. She not only committed herself to Manager Tang and lived a parasitic life, but also directly opposed Zhu Chunhua. Her return to the stage to perform was to seize Zhu Chunhua's stage; she listened to the instructions of Pan and Manager Tang and served as a tool to harm Zhu Chunhua secretly. It seems that the relationship between them is written as a kind of opposition. However, the author describes it this way precisely to peddle the goods of human nature theory, to unify their opposing relationship on the basis of "human nature," "human sentiment," and "love." Look, isn't Zhu Chunhua full of human sympathy for Xing Yuehong's depravity? She tried to move her with "sincere" "sisterly feelings." When she heard that Yuehong had decided to marry Manager Tang, she was extremely angry and gave her a slap in the face, followed by two lines of hot tears. Zhu Chunhua's mood at this time was both hate, pain, and love. She hated that Xing Yuehong had not followed the instructions of her master at the time of her death, and had not acted and lived cleanly; she felt pain that the sisters would be separated from each other in the future, and that sisterly feelings were difficult to sever. Both of these points are built on the foundation of love. And the climax of the expression of their sisterly feelings is in the enemy's court. Pan and Manager Tang pushed Xing Yuehong to the court, with the aim of turning the political case into a "sisterly feud," so that the "sisters would break off all ties." At that time, Xing Yuehong had been completely conquered by them. However, after she appeared in court, she hesitated and stopped as soon as she saw Chunhua, losing her courage. Because they were sisters with deep feelings, she couldn't bear to do it. At the crucial moment, Chunhua stood up beside her. She did not expose the enemy's conspiracy, but talked at length about sisterly feelings, saying, "Even though she is blinded by ghosts, unable to distinguish between humans and ghosts, she has fallen, but no matter how degenerate she is, she will never secretly harm sisters who have gone through thick and thin together!" She declared: "I understand that someone wants to destroy our sisterly feelings, frame others, and let the real culprit escape the law... that can't be done!" This means that no matter how degenerate Xing Yuehong is, she is still
  "human," and will recognize "sisterly feelings," and "sisterly feelings" are above all else. Look, is there anything in the world deeper than the feelings of these two sisters? No wonder Yuehong was so moved that she fainted in court, Manager Tang was at a loss and unable to parry, and the puppet court was also unable to clean up the mess. Of course, Zhu Chunhua also achieved a thorough "victory" from this. This is simply absurd! Chairman Mao told us: "There is absolutely no such thing in the world as love without reason, nor hatred without reason. As for so-called 'human love,' there has never been such unified love since mankind was divided into classes." For Xing Yuehong, a person who has already degenerated and is already with the reactionaries, to immediately repent after being moved by a few words of so-called true feelings, is this not a complete deception? The reason why the film's writers and directors made such a treatment of the relationship between Zhu Chunhua and Xing Yuehong is to peddle the revisionist goods of "human nature," "human sentiment," and "human love."
    As everyone knows, most of the so-called literature and art of the 1930s are works that vigorously promote universal human nature, human sentiment, and human love. Modern revisionism also promotes this set of goods; "Stage Sisters" is also from the same source. This fully proves that "Stage Sisters" is a completely revisionist film, a variant of the literature and art of the "1930s."
    Pull Out This Big Poisonous Arrow, Thoroughly Disinfect
    In the past decade or so since the founding of the country, an anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the literary and art circles has long monopolized and controlled the literary and art circles, constantly stirring up gusts of evil wind and launching rampant attacks everywhere. During the three years of hardship, this attack reached its peak. From theory to creation, it shot out a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous arrows, peddled a large number of bourgeois and revisionist black goods, and tried its best to create a superstition in the literature and art of the "1930s," spreading heresies that deviated from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and fallacies that betrayed the path of people's war. The film "Stage Sisters" is a model carefully produced under their strong support and encouragement, a charming poisonous arrow. It repackages the bourgeois characters, bourgeois ideas, and bourgeois paths of the 1930s, and sells them again, vainly attempting to cancel and oppose the leadership of the Party, cancel and slander class struggle, and clear the way for capitalist restoration by promoting individual struggle and bourgeois humanitarianism. Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and demons should be criticized and must not be allowed to run rampant freely." We must pull out this poisonous arrow and thoroughly eradicate this poisonous weed!

    《舞台姐妹》是黑线射出的毒箭
    上海永大染织一厂影剧评论小组
    看了电影《舞台姐妹》，有的同志说：“这部影片的气味很臭！跟夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙解放前搞的电影，简直是一个路子，一个调调。”我们觉得这话很对。这部影片打着迷人的幌子，运用隐晦的手法，竭力鼓吹资产阶级个人奋斗，大肆宣扬资产阶级人性论，它是反党反社会主义的黑线的产物，它是“三十年代”文艺、资产阶级文艺思想和现代修正主义文艺思想结合起来的一支毒箭。
    宣扬个人奋斗，歌颂错误路线
    三十年代电影的主人公，大都是资产阶级或小资产阶级的知识分子，大多是个人奋斗的“英雄好汉”。作者为他们个人奋斗的胜利大唱颂歌，为他们个人奋斗的挫折或失败大鸣不平。这种资产阶级的个人奋斗，在三十年代已经是反动的了，到六十年代的今天，更成了社会主义革命的对象。但是，那些对社会主义心怀不满的人，仍在竭力兜售这种个人奋斗的腐朽透了的黑货，影片《舞台姐妹》的主人公竺春花，就是他们精心塑造出来的个人奋斗的典型。
    在影片里，竺春花被描写成一个不受利诱，不慕虚荣的“清清白白”的“好人”，不畏强暴，不受凌辱，敢于抗争的“英雄”。剧团唐经理要竺春花她们演《马寡妇开店》，低声下气地央求，竺春花一口拒绝；女流氓沈家姆妈要收她做过房女儿，捧上了崭新的行头，她不理不睬；地痞绍兴阿炳，要她去唱堂会打秋风，她拒绝不干；越剧皇后商水花上吊自杀后，她敢于出面斗争；潘委员等以子弹威胁，她一笑置之，照样演她的《祝福》。是什么使她“敢作敢为”的呢？一句话，是靠她“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”得来的，是靠她个人努力奋斗得来的。编导者告诉我们：只要依靠个人奋斗，成了名，成了家，就有了靠山，有了资本，有了一切；就可以为所欲为，别人动不得她一根毫毛；就可以保持自己的“人权”、“人格”和“自由”，不受“任何人”的束缚，不受“任何人”的压迫和欺凌。影片编导者不仅突出地渲染了竺春花个人奋斗的“英雄”行为，而且热情地歌颂了竺春花个人奋斗的“胜利”。你看，竺春花拒绝演《马寡妇开店》，唐经理奈何她不得，拒绝唱堂会，绍兴阿炳拿她没办法；她想占用戏馆，唐经理只得应允，她要演新戏《祝福》，潘委员之流束手无策。编导者也装模作样地写了一点所谓“迫害”，什么《祝福》禁演啦，什么潘委员、唐经理指使和尚阿鑫暗害她啦，等等，但目的是歌颂她个人奋斗的胜利。你看，反动派的法庭不是掩盖他们罪恶勾当的场所，相反地，竺春花成了精神的审判者，一席“慷慨陈词”，使法官手足无措，使潘委员、唐经理的阴谋宣告破产。脱离党的领导，脱离广大群众的斗争，仅仅依靠个人单枪匹马的奋斗，就可以轻而易举地斗倒敌人，赢得一个接一个的胜利，这就是编导者告诉我们的结论。
    这完全是欺人之谈。影片展开的背景是一九三五年到一九五○年，这是民族斗争和阶级斗争十分激烈的时代，这是广大群众在党的领导下展开波澜壮阔的斗争的时代。影片回避了激烈的革命风暴，把一场姐妹之间的恩怨以及由此造成的种种纠葛，冒充为阶级斗争，这本来就是错误的。在这个基础上，影片的编导者又进一步宣传这样的观点：这种
  “阶级斗争”，只要依靠竺春花单枪匹马的个人奋斗就能获得胜利。我们知道，阶级斗争的任何一个胜利都是和党的领导以及群众的支持分不开的。这种胜利绝不是什么依靠个人的力量就可以取得的，也绝不是象电影中的竺春花，在反动派的法庭上，用几句不痛不痒的话，再加上几个群众的嘘声就轻而易举地能把反动派击败的。影片歌颂的竺春花为实现自己的最高理想——“在台上昂头做戏，在台下挺胸做人”所进行的“斗争”，纯粹是个人的奋斗，这同广大群众在党的领导下有组织的阶级斗争完全是两回事；为了美化竺春花，影片甚至把广大群众描写得麻木不仁，超然在斗争之外，极尽丑化之能事。这样的斗争能获得胜利吗？
    这里还需要强调指出的是：影片通过竺春花“英雄”故事，显示这种不顾一切的盲动冒险斗争，是正确的，是可以取得胜利的。这样，当然不需要正确的政治路线了。十几年来，象这样专门歌颂错误路线的作品，决不止是《舞台姐妹》一部电影。
    鼓吹资产阶级人性和人情取消阶级斗争
    影片还竭力宣扬了资产阶级的人性和人情，大谈“姐妹之情”，“父女之情”，“师徒之情”，企图使人们相信，人与人之间只要有了“真实感情”，什么问题都能解决。这一点，特别表现在竺春花和邢月红的关系上。她们姐妹两人来上海唱戏成名后，由于邢月红的自己“犯贱”，背叛了父亲“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”的遗嘱，走上了堕落的道路。她不仅委身于唐经理，过着寄生虫的生活，而且直接和竺春花作对。她再度登台唱戏是为了抢竺春花的舞台；她听从了潘委员、唐经理的指使，充当了暗害竺春花的工具。似乎把她们之间的关系写成一种对立的状态了。然而作者这样描写，正是为了贩卖人性论的货色，为了使她们这种对立的关系在“人性”“人情”和“爱”的基础上统一起来。你看，竺春花对于邢月红的堕落，不正是充满着一种人性的同情吗？她企图以“真挚”的“姐妹感情”来感动她。当她听到月红决定嫁给唐经理时，她气愤已极，随手一记耳光，接着就是两行热泪。竺春花这时的心情是既恨，又痛心，又爱。她恨的是邢月红没有按照师父临终时的教导，没有清清白白地唱戏和做人；她痛的是今后姐妹将东西分离，姐妹情难以割舍。这两点都是建筑在爱的基础上的。而表现他们姐妹之情的最高潮是在敌人的法庭上。潘委员、唐经理把邢月红推上法庭，目的是为了把政治案件化为“姐妹恩怨”，使“姐妹之间恩断义绝”。当时的邢月红已经完全被他们征服。可是她出庭以后，一见春花就欲言又止，失去了勇气。因为是姐妹情深，不忍下手，正在紧要关头，春花在旁站了起来。她没有揭露敌人的阴谋，而是大谈姐妹之情，说什么“尽管她是鬼迷心窍，人鬼不分，她堕落了，可是她再堕落也决不会暗害一起同过患难的姐妹！”她宣告：“我明白，有人是想破坏我们姐妹的情分，嫁祸于人，让真正的凶手逃出法网，……这办不到！”这就是说，不管邢月红堕落到什么地步，她还是
  “人”，还会认“姐妹情”，“姐妹情”高于一切。你看，天底下还有比这对姐妹感情再深的吗？无怪乎月红要被感动得当堂昏倒，唐经理不知所措无法招架，伪法庭也弄得不可收场了。当然竺春花也由此而得到彻底的“胜利”。这简直是奇谈！毛主席告诉我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。至于所谓‘人类之爱’，自从人类分化成为阶级以后，就没有过这种统一的爱。”对于邢月红这样一个已经堕落而且已经跟反动派一起的人，经过三言两语所谓真实感情的感动，就会立即悔悟过来，这不是彻头彻尾的欺骗吗？影片编导者所以要把竺春花和邢月红的关系作这样的处理，目的是为了贩卖“人性”“人情”“人类之爱”这种修正主义货色。
    大家知道，所谓三十年代的文艺，大多是这类竭力宣扬普遍的人性、人情和人类之爱的作品。现代修正主义所宣扬的也是这一套货色；《舞台姐妹》也是同出一辙。这就充分证明，《舞台姐妹》是一部彻头彻尾的修正主义影片，是“三十年代”文艺的一个变种。
    拔掉这支大毒箭，彻底消毒
    建国后的十几年来，文艺界一条反党反社会主义的黑线，长期垄断着、控制着文艺界，不时刮起一股股妖风，到处猖狂进攻。在三年困难时期，这种进攻发展到了顶峰，从理论到创作，射出了大量反党反社会主义的毒箭，贩卖了大量资产阶级和修正主义的黑货，竭力制造对“三十年代”文艺的迷信，散布离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之经，叛人民战争之道的谬论。影片《舞台姐妹》就是在他们大力支持和鼓励下精心制作的一个样板，一支迷人的毒箭。它把三十年代的资产阶级的人物，资产阶级的思想，资产阶级的道路，装潢一下门面，重新拿出来贩卖，妄图通过宣扬个人奋斗，宣扬资产阶级人道主义来取消和反对党的领导，取消和诋毁阶级斗争，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我们一定要拔掉这支毒箭，彻底铲除这棵毒草！
