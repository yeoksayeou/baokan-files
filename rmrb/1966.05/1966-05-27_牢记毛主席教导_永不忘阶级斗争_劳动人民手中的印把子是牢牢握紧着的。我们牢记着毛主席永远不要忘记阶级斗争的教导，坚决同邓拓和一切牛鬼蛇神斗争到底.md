    Firmly Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings, Never Forget Class Struggle
    The seal of power in the hands of the working people is firmly grasped. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching to never forget class struggle and resolutely struggle against Deng Tuo and all demons and monsters to the end.
    Li Neng, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Jinning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan Province
    After reading the newspaper's exposure of the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of a small handful of people like Deng Tuo, I felt that these guys are really too vicious and too rampant. They attacked the Party's leadership, opposed the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, and wanted to drive us off the stage. I am very angry. This is a major issue of right and wrong. If we don't have the Party's leadership and the dictatorship of the proletariat, it means that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants will return to the past society where people eat people and live the lives of beasts of burden. That is not acceptable, and we will never agree!
    Before the liberation of Yunnan, I was a long-term laborer for landlords and rich peasants. Under the dark rule of the reactionary classes, we had mouths but no place to speak politically, and economically we suffered from the exploitation of landlords and rich peasants through land rent, usury, large scales and small measures, and wage deductions. For years, we lived on wild mountain grass and vegetables, and the landlord class even ridiculed us as "covering ourselves with copper wire blankets (palm-bark clothing) and sleeping on rattling carpets (leaves)." We poor and lower-middle peasants will never forget that kind of suffering. After liberation, the Party rescued us poor and lower-middle peasants from the fire pit and cultivated me from a militia member, mutual aid group leader, agricultural cooperative director, township head, and Party branch secretary all the way to county party secretary. The working people have grasped the seal of power. When I was still an ordinary peasant, I was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress to participate in the discussion of national affairs. I ask, in history, which dynasty had such democracy? In the world, which exploitative class dictatorship country can let the working people manage state affairs? Our seal of power was not dropped from the sky, but was seized from the landlords and the bourgeoisie by the working people after years of arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice under the leadership of the Party. Our power did not come easily. We working people wholeheartedly love the Party and Chairman Mao, shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!" We want to shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!" for all generations to come! You small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements want our beloved Party to step down and "rest," and want to engage in counter-revolutionary restoration and take away our happy life today. This is wishful thinking!
    Deng Tuo and his gang scold our Party for "relying on power and being domineering" and "unpopular." This represents the reactionary clamor of modern revisionists, right-leaning opportunists, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. I solemnly warn Deng Tuo, we are going to be "domineering" towards you a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist guys and the reactionary class you represent, we are going to eradicate your anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and we are going to implement dictatorship over all reactionary classes, and we will not allow you to talk and act recklessly.
    We cadres from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants personally feel that if the seal of power is in our own hands, we can carry out the socialist revolution, and with the socialist revolution, production and construction will also develop by leaps and bounds. Let's take our Jinning County and my hometown of Shangsuan Village as examples! In the past, Jinning was one of the "four poorest prefectures" in the province, with severe droughts and two crop failures in three years. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, with basic farmland construction, the irrigated area of paddy fields has increased from more than 20 percent to more than 80 percent. On the basis of water conservancy, we have continued to move towards electrification and mechanization. Now, during the spring plowing season every year, more than 50 tractors supported by the county and Kunming City participate in plowing. More than half of the brigades in the county have electricity. My hometown, Shangsuan Village, used to be a place where maggots couldn't even survive, with floods in front of the village and droughts behind the village, and the grain yield per mu was only about one hundred jin. More than 50 poor and lower-middle peasant families used to eat 70% wild vegetables and 30% grain every year. In the 30 years before liberation, they didn't add a single house, and they couldn't even put together 20 cotton quilts. Now, the entire commune has achieved water conservancy, uses tractors, and also has electricity. The grain yield per mu has greatly increased, and most families have surplus grain. Even the poorest families have one to two sets of cotton quilts. The whole village has built fifty or sixty new tile-roofed houses. Under the leadership of the Party, our lives are really like eating sugar cane, each section sweeter than the last. Now Deng Tuo and his gang scold us for "bragging" and "talking big," and slander us for "destroying all the property of an egg." This is blatant lying, this is wishful thinking to overthrow the Party's leadership and seize the seal of power from the hands of our working people. I solemnly warn Deng Tuo: The seal of power in the hands of the working people is firmly grasped. We must resolutely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching about never forgetting class and class struggle, and resolutely fight to the end with you and your gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist demons and monsters.

    牢记毛主席教导  永不忘阶级斗争
    劳动人民手中的印把子是牢牢握紧着的。我们牢记着毛主席永远不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，坚决同邓拓和一切牛鬼蛇神斗争到底
    全国人民代表大会代表中共云南省晋宁县委书记  李能
    看了报上揭露邓拓等一小撮人反党反社会主义的言行以后，感到这些家伙真是太恶毒太猖狂了。他们攻击党的领导，反对总路线、大跃进、人民公社，攻击无产阶级专政，要赶我们下台。我心里很气愤。这是个大是大非问题。不要党的领导，不要无产阶级专政，就是要广大贫下中农再回到过去人吃人的社会，过牛马的生活。那是不行的，我们永远不会答应！
    云南解放以前，我是一个给地主富农做长工的。在反动阶级的黑暗统治下，在政治上我们有嘴没有说话的地方，经济上受尽地主富农的地租、高利贷、大秤小斗、克扣工资的剥削，长年靠山茅草野菜过活，地主阶级还讥笑我们“盖的是铜丝被（棕衣），垫的是响铃毯（树叶）”。我们贫下中农永远也不会忘记过去的那种痛苦。解放后，党把我们贫下中农从火坑中救出来，把我从民兵、互助组长、农业合作社主任、乡长、党支部书记一直培养成县委书记。劳动人民掌握了印把子。当我还是一个普通农民的时候，我就被选为全国人民代表大会代表，参加讨论国家的大事，试问在历史上，哪一个朝代有这样的民主？在世界上，哪一个剥削阶级专政的国家能让劳动人民管理国家大事？我们这个印把子不是天上掉下来的，而是在党的领导下，劳动人民经过多年艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲，向地主、资产阶级夺取来的。我们的权得来是不容易的。我们劳动人民打心里热爱党和毛主席，喊毛主席万万岁，共产党万万岁，我们要永世永辈喊毛主席、共产党万万岁！你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子要我们亲爱的党下台“休息”，想搞反革命复辟，夺去我们今天的幸福生活，这是妄想！
    邓拓等一伙骂我们党“依靠权势，蛮横逞强”、“不得人心”。这是代表现代修正主义分子、右倾机会主义分子和地、富、反、坏的反动叫嚣。正告邓拓，我们就是要对你们一小撮反党反社会主义的家伙以及你所代表的反动阶级“蛮横逞强”，就是要铲除你们反党反社会主义的黑线，就是要向一切反动阶级实行专政，不准你们乱说乱动。
    我们贫下中农出身的干部和广大贫下中农，亲身感受到印把子掌握在自己手里就能搞社会主义革命，搞了社会主义革命，生产建设也飞跃发展了。就拿我们晋宁县和我的家乡上算村来说吧！过去的晋宁是全省“四大穷州”之一，干旱严重，三年两不收。解放后，特别是大跃进以来，搞了农田基本建设，水田保灌面积由百分之二十多增加到百分之八十以上，在水利化基础上，接着又向电气化、机械化迈进。现在每年春耕的时候，有本县及昆明市支援的五十多台拖拉机参加犁田，全县有半数以上的大队有了电。我的家乡上算村原来是拉屎不生蛆的地方，村前淹死（涝），村后晒死（旱），粮食单产只有一百来斤。五十多家贫下中农，每年吃的是七成野菜三成粮，解放前三十年内没有增添一间房子，连二十床棉被也凑不齐。现在全公社实现水利化了，用上了拖拉机，也有了电，粮食单产大大提高，大多数人家都有余粮。最少的人家都有一至二套棉被。全村盖起了五六十间新瓦房。在党的领导下，我们的生活真象是吃甘蔗，一节比一节甜。现在邓拓等一伙骂我们是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，污蔑我们“一个鸡蛋的家当全部毁掉了”。这是睁着眼睛说瞎话，这是妄想推翻党的领导，夺我们劳动人民手里的印把子。正告邓拓：劳动人民手中的印把子是牢牢握紧着的，我们要坚决高举毛泽东思想红旗，牢记毛主席关于永远不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争的教导，坚决和你们这一伙反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神斗争到底。
