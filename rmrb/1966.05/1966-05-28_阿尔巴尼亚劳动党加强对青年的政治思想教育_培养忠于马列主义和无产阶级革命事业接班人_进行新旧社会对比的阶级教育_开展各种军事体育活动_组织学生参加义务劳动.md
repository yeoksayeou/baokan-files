    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 22nd - Our correspondent reports: The Albanian Labor Party has adopted various measures to strengthen the political and ideological education of youth, cultivating and fostering successors loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the cause of proletarian revolution.

    Since the launch of the revolutionization movement this spring, more than a thousand young people have responded to the Party's call and gone to the agricultural production front, contributing their strength to vigorously developing agricultural and livestock production and striving for food self-sufficiency. Several thousand young cadres have also gone to the industrial production front. This year, 114 graduates from the Tirana Agricultural College requested that the Party send them to work in the most remote and arduous mountain areas. The Party organization met their request.

    According to the directives of the Labor Party, the Albanian Labor Youth Union is currently conducting education on the contrast between the old and new societies for young people throughout the country. Labor Youth Union organizations in various regions invite old workers and old peasants who suffered deeply in the old society to tell young people about the suffering and oppression they endured in the old society. Some places have even preserved the thatched huts where poor peasants used to live as living teaching materials for educating young people. Some places organize young people to write village histories and family histories. Many schools use "Recalling the lives of fathers and brothers in the old society" as essay topics for students. After listening to an old poor peasant from Lushnjë District talk about their past struggle with feudal lords for the right to graze on a barren mountain, the youth resolved to inherit the traditions of the older generation, respond to the Party's call to develop mountainous areas, and transform this barren mountain into a mountain of flowers and fruits.

    At the beginning of this year, the Albanian Labor Party made a decision "on further developing sports activities," especially calling on the broad masses of young people to actively participate in various sports activities in order to defend the motherland and accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland. Since that time, all schools in urban and rural areas across the country have universally established a morning exercise system.

    Local organizations of the Labor Youth League also widely organize military sports activities such as "guerrilla marches" and mountain climbing. Since the beginning of this year, the city of Tirana alone has had 70,000 young people participating in these activities. In February and March, the Albanian Ministry of Defense and the Labor Youth League organized more than a thousand young people, fully armed, to follow the route taken by the guerrillas during the Liberation War, traversing mountains and rivers for a 400-kilometer march. In the marching activities organized in various places, veteran guerrillas who had participated in the opposition to German and Italian fascism and domestic class enemies were invited to serve as guides, and they were asked to introduce to the young people the heroic deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who shed blood and sacrificed for the liberation of the motherland, educating the youth to inherit the revolutionary traditions of their predecessors and be good successors to the revolution. In these marches, which were of great educational significance, the youth received great training, and many outstanding young people were admitted as members of the Labor Youth League.

    The Albanian Labor Party attaches great importance to educating intellectual youth on physical labor, believing that "treating labor with a socialist attitude towards labor is one of the most fundamental issues in conducting communist education for young people." Last year, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League used the summer vacation to organize more than 10,000 college and middle school students across the country to participate in voluntary labor in factories and rural areas for a period of one month. The young people were not afraid of being tired or dirty and completed hundreds of thousands of workdays. In labor training and life, the young people also mingled with workers and peasants, learning their excellent qualities. 1,900 young people were awarded the honorary title of "Youth Shock Worker" for their outstanding labor, and 3,200 young people were commended. This summer vacation, the Labor Youth League is also preparing to organize young people from schools across the country to participate in voluntary labor. 18,000 university and middle school students in grades 9-12 have already signed up to participate. Except for university students and students of secondary technical schools who have professional internships during the summer, all will basically participate in this year's summer labor. In addition, students from major universities and middle schools across the country also widely use Sundays to participate in field labor, repair canals and build dams, build public facilities, or participate in road construction, tree planting, and afforestation. Schools located in rural areas have also established school production bases as places for students to conduct labor and scientific experiments, cultivate and train students' labor viewpoints, and enrich their production knowledge.

    新华社地拉那二十二日电　本社记者报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党采取各种措施，加强对青年的政治思想教育，培养和造就忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    自今年春天开展革命化运动以来，已有一千多名青年响应党的号召，走上了农业生产战线，为大力发展农牧业生产和争取粮食自给贡献出自己的力量。还有上千名年轻的干部走上了工业生产战线。今年地拉那农学院的一百十四名毕业生要求党把他们派到最边远、最艰苦的山区去工作。党组织满足了他们的要求。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟根据劳动党的指示，目前正在全国各地对青年开展新旧社会对比的教育。各地劳动青年联盟邀请在旧社会苦大仇深的老工人、老农民向青年讲述他们在旧社会遭受的苦难和压迫。有的地方还把过去贫苦农民住的茅屋留下来，作为教育青年的活教材。有的地方组织青年写村史和家史。不少学校把“回忆父兄在旧社会的生活”作为学生的作文题。卢什涅区的青年在听了一位老贫农讲述他们过去为争夺一座荒山的放牧权同封建主进行斗争的情况后，决心继承老一辈人的传统，响应党提出的发展山区的号召，要把这座荒山开辟为花果山。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在今年年初作出了一项“关于进一步开展体育锻炼活动”的决定，特别号召广大青年为保卫祖国和加速祖国的社会主义建设，积极参加各种体育活动。从那个时候起，全国城乡所有学校都普遍建立起早操制度。
    劳动青年联盟各地组织还广泛组织“游击队行军”和爬山等军事体育活动。今年以来，仅仅地拉那市就有七万名青年参加了这一活动。阿尔巴尼亚国防部和劳动青年联盟二、三月间组织了一千多名青年全副武装，循着解放战争期间，游击队所走过的路线，翻山涉水，进行了一次四百公里的行军。在各地组织的行军活动中，都请当年参加过反对德、意法西斯和国内阶级敌人的老游击队员作为向导，并请他们在行军途中向青年们介绍老一代革命者为祖国的解放事业流血牺牲、英勇战斗的事迹，教育青年继承先辈的革命传统，当好革命接班人。在这些具有丰富教育意义的行军中，青年受到很大锻炼，许多优秀的青年被吸收为劳动青年联盟盟员。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党很重视对知识青年进行体力劳动的教育，认为“以社会主义的劳动态度对待劳动，是对青年进行共产主义教育的最根本的问题之一”。阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央去年曾利用暑假组织了全国一万多名大、中学生去工厂、农村参加为期一个月的义务劳动。青年们不怕累、不怕脏，先后共做了几十万个劳动日。在劳动锻炼和生活上，青年们还和工人、农民打成一片，学习他们的优秀品质。一千九百多名青年由于出色的劳动而获得了“青年突击手”的光荣称号，三千二百名青年受到了表扬。今年暑假，劳动青年联盟还准备组织全国各地学校青年参加义务劳动，现在已有一万八千名大学生和九——十二年级的中学生报名参加，全国除在暑期有专业实习的大学生和中等技术学校的学生外，基本上都将参加今年的暑期劳动。此外，全国各大中学校的学生还广泛利用星期天参加田间劳动、修渠筑坝、兴建公共设施，或者参加修路、植树造林等劳动。设在农村的学校还建立起学校的生产基地，作为学生们进行劳动和科学实验的场所，培养和锻炼学生的劳动观点，丰富他们的生产知识。（附图片）
