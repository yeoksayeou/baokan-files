	Filipino Reporter Says China's Progress Shatters Illusions About the United States
	China's Self-Reliant Efforts in Construction Achieve Splendid Results

	Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Manila News: _Manila Times_ reporter Cruz recently visited China and in an article published on May 23rd, he praised the Chinese people for thoroughly eliminating the influence of American interference and control, and for achieving splendid results through self-reliance in building their own country.

	Cruz wrote in his article on his impressions of China: "The Chinese are the only people in Asia who have thoroughly and permanently eliminated all remnants of American interference and control."

	He said, the Chinese people are happy to tell visitors how they defeated American imperialism. Other Asians, of course, envy their immortal achievement. Since 1949, the Chinese people have "accomplished the task of building up their once war-torn and exploited country." He said, the impressive progress made by the Chinese people can shatter some people's illusions about the United States.

	He said, people from the United States, whose homeland is thousands of miles away, are trying to make Asia regress. "In other words, American neocolonialism has become a prominent and unwelcome scourge on Asian soil."

	After listing facts such as the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, turning Thailand, Japan, and South Korea into military bases, he wrote: "The Philippines is, of course, an Asian country where Americans interfere not only militarily but in all aspects of life. Americans are struggling to continue controlling the Philippine economy; they interfere in Philippine politics; they are impatient with the Philippine Congress for delaying the passage of laws such as the aid to South Vietnam bill proposed by the United States." He also said: "As long as Filipinos think carefully and observe their own situation, they will definitely find that American influence in all aspects is the biggest obstacle to their healthy development and progress."

    菲报记者说中国的进步使人打破了对美国的幻想
    中国自力更生努力建设成就辉煌
    新华社二十五日讯　马尼拉消息：《马尼拉时报》记者克鲁斯最近访问中国后，在五月二十三日写的一篇文章中赞扬中国人民彻底清除美国干涉和控制的影响，依靠自力更生的原则努力建设自己的国家所取得的光辉成就。
    克鲁斯在他的这一篇访华观感中写道：“中国人是亚洲唯一一个彻底地和永不改变地清除一切美国干涉和控制的残余的民族。”
    他说，中国人是乐于告诉客人们，他们是如何打败美帝国主义的。其他的亚洲人当然对他们取得的这个不朽的成就表示羡慕。自一九四九年以来，中国人民“实现了把他们这个千疮百孔的和受剥削的国家建设起来的任务”。他说，中国人所取得的给人印象深刻的进步，可以打破一些人对美国“所抱有的幻想”。
    他说，本国国土在几千里外的美国人，竭力要使亚洲倒退，“换一句话说，美国新殖民主义已经成为亚洲土地上的一个显著的不受欢迎的大害。”
    他在列举美国侵略越南，把泰国、日本、南朝鲜变为军事基地等事实后写道：“菲律宾当然是不仅在军事上受美国人干预，而且在生活的各方面也受他们干预的一个亚洲国家。美国人正在力争继续控制菲律宾的经济；他们干预菲律宾的政治；他们对菲律宾国会迟迟不批准如援助南越法等美国倡议的法律而表示不耐烦”。他还说：“只要菲律宾人仔细想一想并好好观察一下自己的情况，他们将一定会发现，美国在各方面对他们的影响正是妨碍他们取得健康的发展和进步的唯一最大的障碍。”
