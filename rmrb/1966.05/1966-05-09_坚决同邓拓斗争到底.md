    Resolutely Struggle Against Deng Tuo to the End
    Yang Baoyi, Liu Yuanyuan, Duan Zhisheng, Young Peasants of Shangkou Village Brigade, Changping County, Beijing

    In his article "The Theory of Cherishing Labor Power," Deng Tuo vigorously promoted the feudal ruling class's cherishing of the people's strength, and even said, "The ancients of the seventh century BC already understood these principles, and we, living in the 1960s of the twentieth century, should of course understand these principles even more clearly." Here, Deng Tuo praised the feudal ruling class on the one hand, and sarcastically scolded our Party for not being as good as the ancients and not knowing how to cherish the people's strength on the other. We want to tell Deng Tuo that we poor and lower-middle peasants know in our hearts who is good and who is bad. If you want to scold our Party, we will resolutely fight back!

    Our home is right in the Thirteen Tombs area. The older generation here knows that when the emperors of the past built a tomb, they caused countless families to suffer and countless people to lose their lives. Yongling alone took twelve years to build, using the labor of 40,000 people every day. The stone materials used for building the tomb were transported from Fangshan by sixteen-wheeled carts, requiring 20,000 laborers and twenty-eight days; the nanmu wood used for building the tomb was felled from the primeval forests of Sichuan. During the wood felling, often a thousand people would enter the mountains, and only five hundred would return. What's even more cruel is that once the emperor's tomb was completed, all the laborers who built the tomb would be killed. Deng Tuo, tell us, where did the feudal ruling class cherish the people's strength? Isn't this deliberately embellishing the feudal ruling class, and isn't it a slanderous attack on our Party? Deng Tuo, to be honest, the eyes of us poor and lower-middle peasants are sharp, and it is absolutely impossible to deceive us!

    Deng Tuo not only tried his best to beautify the landlord bosses, but what makes us even more angry is that he put on an appearance of "speaking up for the people," slandering the Great Leap Forward as "abusing the people's strength," and scolding our Party for not cherishing the people's strength during the three consecutive years of severe natural disasters, saying, "We should gain new inspiration from the experience of the ancients." Deng Tuo, you are purely talking nonsense, slandering us poor and lower-middle peasants, and attempting to sow discord between the Party and us poor and lower-middle peasants. We are determined to fight you to the end!

    坚决同邓拓斗争到底
    北京昌平县上口村大队青年农民　杨宝义　刘源源　段志胜
    邓拓在《爱护劳动力的学说》一文中，大肆宣扬封建统治阶级爱护民力，并且说什么“纪元前七世纪的古人尚且懂得这些道理，我们生当二十世纪六十年代，当然就应该更清楚地懂得这些道理。”邓拓在这里一方面吹捧封建统治阶级，一方面含沙射影地骂我们党不如古人，不懂得爱护民力。我们要告诉邓拓，谁个好，谁个坏，我们贫、下中农心里明白，你要骂我们党，我们坚决要反击！
    我们家就住在十三陵。这里的老一辈人都知道，过去的皇帝修一个坟，不知道使多少人家遭了殃，不知道使多少百姓丧了命。光是一个永陵，就修了十二年，每天用四万人的劳力。修陵用的石料，是用十六轮大车，二万民夫，二十八天才能从房山运来；修陵用的楠木，是从四川的原始森林里采伐来的。采木时，往往是入山一千人，出山只剩下五百人。更残忍的是，皇帝的坟修好了，修坟的民工也都统统要被弄死。请问邓拓，封建统治阶级哪一处是爱护民力的呢？你这不是故意为封建统治阶级涂脂抹粉，不是信口污蔑我们党又是什么呢？邓拓，老实告诉你，我们贫下中农的眼睛是亮的，要想骗我们，绝对办不到！
    邓拓不仅竭力美化地主头子，更使我们气愤的是，他装出一副“为民请命”的样子来，污蔑大跃进是“滥用民力”，骂我们党在连续三年严重自然灾害时不爱护民力，“我们应该从古人的经验中得到新的启发。”邓拓，你这纯粹是在胡说八道，是在污蔑我们贫下中农，妄想挑拨党和我们贫下中农的关系。我们坚决要和你斗到底！
