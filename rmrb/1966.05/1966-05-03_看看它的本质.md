    Look at Its Essence
    The Party branch of the Liu Mengchun Brigade in Cang County, Hebei, initially had diverse opinions when discussing democratic centralism. Some said, "With a thousand mouths in the family, only one person makes the decisions." Others said, "One person, one mouth; one person, one mind; with everyone talking at once, who do you listen to? Anyway, I’m not doing it for personal gain or benefit; what I say should count." These muddled ideas, after repeated discussions, eventually led to a unified understanding.
      "With a thousand mouths in the family, only one person makes the decisions"… These words, on the surface, may seem to make sense. The affairs of the majority must be managed by someone! However, how exactly is this "management" done? Is it personal autocracy, or is it concentrating the opinions of the majority and making decisions based on them? There is a principled difference. It seems that, to implement democratic centralism, the first thing to do is to solve some of the fundamental problems in the thinking of these comrades: Are they placing themselves above the masses or among the masses? Does one person's word count, or is collective leadership implemented? The Party branch of the Liu Mengchun Brigade resolved these issues, and everyone's understanding of democratic centralism became unified.

    看看它的本质
    河北沧县柳孟春大队党支部，讨论民主集中制时，起初议论纷纭。有的说：“家有千口，主事一人。”有的说：“一人一张嘴，一人一个心，七嘴八舌听谁的？反正我一不为私，二不为利，说了就该算数。”等等。这些胡涂思想，经过反复讨论，最后认识是一致了。
      “家有千口，主事一人。”……这些话，从表面看来，似乎也有道理。多数人的事，总得有人拿总嘛！可是，究竟怎样拿总呢？是个人独断专行呢，还是集中大多数人的意见，据以作出决定呢？这是有原则区别的。看来，要贯彻实行民主集中制，首先就要解决这些同志思想中的一些根本性问题：是把自己置于群众之上，还是置于群众之中？是自己一个人说了算，还是实行集体领导？柳孟春大队党支部解决了这些问题，大家对民主集中制的认识就统一了。
