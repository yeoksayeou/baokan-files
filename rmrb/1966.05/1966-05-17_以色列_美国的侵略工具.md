    Israel—An Instrument of American Aggression
    In order to strike at the revolutionary movement of the Arab people and to obtain a tool for aggression and interference in Arab countries, American imperialism single-handedly created the State of Israel in 1948. It is located in the Palestinian region on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering Arab countries such as the United Arab Republic, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.
    The establishment of the State of Israel itself is a product of American imperialism's aggression against Arab countries. For more than a decade, American imperialism has used Israel as a knife inserted into the heart of the Arab world to achieve its political, economic, and military control over Arab countries. The day after Israel was established, on May 15, 1948, it frantically launched a war against neighboring Arab countries. Since then, with the instigation and support of American imperialism, Israel has consistently refused to resolve the Palestinian issue and has continuously provoked border conflicts with Arab countries, infringing upon their sovereignty. In October 1956, Israel even acted as the vanguard of the British and French imperialist aggression against Egypt. Currently, Israel is unilaterally changing the course of the Jordan River, which seriously damages the interests of the Arab countries in the Jordan River basin.
    Arab countries are of significant strategic importance geographically. At the same time, many Arab countries are rich in oil. In order to safeguard its oil and strategic interests, American imperialism has been striving to support Israel and arm it so that Israel can become its base for aggression and offense against the Arab people. Since the establishment of Israel, the United States has signed various agreements with it. Israel has accepted loans, grants, and proceeds from the sale of bonds from the United States, amounting to twenty to thirty billion U.S. dollars, and has obtained various American weapons, including "Hawk" missiles. The United States has also used West Germany as a proxy to hand over American-made weapons worth 80 million U.S. dollars to Israel. In addition, the United States has also provided a large number of loans, grants, and investments to Israel through private channels. According to statistics, by 1958, American capital accounted for 80 percent of foreign capital in Israel. The United States has also established military bases in Israel and stationed military advisors. In short, American imperialism completely controls Israel's political, military, economic, cultural, and other aspects. Israel has completely become a tool and bridgehead for American aggression against Arab countries and the promotion of neo-colonialism.
    American imperialism's policy of hostility and aggression against Arab countries has been strongly opposed by the Arab people. Although the United States has used economic and diplomatic pressure, such as suspending "aid" and instigating West Germany to establish diplomatic relations with Israel, it has not made the Arab people succumb. Instead, it has aroused more intense resistance.　　　(Rong Jiu) (Attached picture)

    以色列—美国的侵略工具
    美帝国主义为了打击阿拉伯人民的革命运动，为了取得一个侵略和干涉阿拉伯国家的工具，在一九四八年一手制造了一个以色列国。它位于地中海东岸巴勒斯坦地区，与阿联、约旦、叙利亚和黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家接壤。
    以色列国的建立本身，就是美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的产物。十多年来，美帝国主义一直利用以色列作为插在阿拉伯心脏的一把刀子，以实现其对阿拉伯各国在政治上、经济上和军事上的控制。以色列建立后的第二天，即一九四八年五月十五日，就疯狂地对邻近的阿拉伯国家发动了战争。自此以后，在美帝国主义的怂恿和支持下，以色列一直拒绝解决巴勒斯坦问题，并且不断挑起和阿拉伯国家的边境冲突，侵犯阿拉伯国家的主权。一九五六年十月，以色列还充当了英法帝国主义所发动的对埃及的侵略战争的马前卒。目前以色列正在单方面改变约旦河道，这严重地损害了约旦河流域的阿拉伯国家的利益。
    阿拉伯国家在地理位置上，具有重要的战略意义。同时，很多阿拉伯国家盛产石油。美帝国主义为了维护它的石油和战略利益，竭力扶植以色列，武装以色列，以便使以色列成为它侵略和进攻阿拉伯人民的基地。从以色列建国以来，美国先后和它签订了各种协定，以色列接受美国的贷款、赠款和出售债券所得的款项，已达二十——三十亿美元，并且得到包括“隼”式导弹在内的各种美国武器。美国还假手西德，把价值八千万美元的美制武器交给以色列。此外，美国还通过私人向以色列提供大量的贷款、赠款和投资。据统计，到一九五八年美国资本就已占到在以色列的外资的百分之八十。美国还在以色列建立军事基地，派驻军事顾问。总之，美帝国主义完全控制着以色列的政治、军事、经济、文化等各个方面。以色列完全成了美国侵略阿拉伯国家和推行新殖民主义的工具和桥头堡。
    美帝国主义的敌视和侵略阿拉伯国家的政策，遭到了阿拉伯人民的强烈反对。尽管美国运用停止“援助”、策动西德同以色列建交等经济上和外交上的压力，但都没有使阿拉伯人民屈服，反而激起了更激烈的反抗。　　　（荣久）（附图片）
