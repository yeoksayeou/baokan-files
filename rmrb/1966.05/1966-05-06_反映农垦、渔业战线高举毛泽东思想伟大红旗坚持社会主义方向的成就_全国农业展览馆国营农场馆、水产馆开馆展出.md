    Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The National Agricultural Exhibition Hall's State-Owned Farm Pavilion officially opened for exhibition on the 3rd.

    The State-Owned Farm Pavilion exhibits fifteen advanced typical units from the agricultural reclamation front, mostly farms or farm production teams, with the exception of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. It also displays the Communist Labor University run by the Jiangxi Reclamation Area. The advanced deeds of these units fully reflect that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, China's agricultural reclamation is constantly advancing along its own path. The workers on this front, proceeding from China's actual conditions, adhering to the revolutionary tradition of Nanniwan, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance of "Dazhai", and taking China's own road, have built batches of farms, ranches, reclamation areas, and many new types of semi-agricultural, semi-study schools from scratch, from small to large, in border areas, coastal areas, mountainous areas, or deserts, making significant contributions to the country's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    The fifteen advanced units exhibited this time, through a large number of pictures, materials, physical objects, and models, focus on telling the audience vividly and powerfully that in the establishment, operation, and production of farms in China, there is class struggle, and there is a struggle between two roads for running farms and two kinds of thinking for running farms. Wherever they act according to Mao Zedong Thought, proceed from actual conditions, give prominence to politics, give play to the positive factors of people, dare to break old ground and establish new ground, are not bound by "foreign frameworks" and "old frameworks," are self-reliant, work hard, and take their own road, the farms will be full of vitality, prosper, and the road will become wider and wider, and the farms will be better and better. This is the common experience of the fifteen advanced units exhibited this time.

    The exhibition of the deeds and experiences of these advanced units will further promote and accelerate the rapid development of China's agricultural reclamation.

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Aquatic Products Pavilion of the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall officially opened for exhibition on May 3rd.

    The exhibition in the Aquatic Products Pavilion reflects the achievements and development of China's state-owned fisheries and collective fisheries production teams in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the socialist direction, adhering to the general line, and carrying forward the spirit of Dazhai. Most of the twenty-five typical units exhibited are fishery communes or production brigades that have rapidly developed and strengthened their collective economies in recent years through self-reliance and hard work; in addition, there are state-owned fishery enterprises and institutions that run enterprises and undertakings diligently and thriftily and actively support the development of the collective economy by the communes and brigades; there are revolutionized and combat-ready fishing fleets; and new achievements in production technology of several units are also exhibited.

    The deeds of these advanced units on display prominently reflect the changes in China's fishing areas, the upsurge in fishery production, and the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of fishermen and fishery workers. Here, people can see that fishermen who drifted on the water for generations and lived in extreme poverty in the old society, after embarking on the socialist road to common prosperity, have developed production, built new fishing villages, and have motorized sailing boats that are not afraid of wind and waves and can fish in the outer seas; thus, their contribution to the country, to socialist construction, and to improving people's lives is growing.

    From the deeds of these advanced units, it can also be seen that both state-owned fisheries and collective fisheries are actively reforming technology self-reliantly and are gradually moving towards mechanization. Since communization, motorized sailing boats used for marine fishing have spread to more than 150 cities and counties along the coast, and the total horsepower of motorized sailing boats has increased fivefold compared with before communization. The repair and construction of fishing boats, the manufacture of netting, and the processing, refrigeration, and transportation of fish products in fishing areas are also gradually becoming mechanized. With the improvement of the degree of mechanization, fishing grounds are constantly expanding, the types of fish caught are increasing, fish production is rising, and the quality of fish products is improving. At the same time, mechanized operations greatly reduce the physical labor intensity of fishermen, enhance the ability to resist natural disasters, and ensure safe operations.

    The fact that the aquatic products industry must also take its own road is also a prominent feature of the exhibition of advanced models this time. Facts have proved that while developing fishery production, carrying out diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries in accordance with local conditions, and changing the single operation of fisheries can give full play to the potential of human and material resources, can fully and rationally utilize natural resources, and can achieve mutual promotion of fishery and agriculture, resist natural disasters, stabilize income, consolidate the collective economy, and create more wealth for the country. The Huanghai Brigade of Beikan Commune in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, the Tanhu Island Fishery Brigade of Yangshan Commune in Shengsi County, Zhejiang Province, and the Dongfa Fishery Team of Dongfa Commune in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, which are exhibited in the Aquatic Products Pavilion, have taken the lead in developing diversified operations and have achieved great results.

    Many of the advanced units exhibited in this pavilion are also advanced units in militia work. This shows that China's aquatic products industry has grown and strengthened in constant struggle. The broad masses of fishermen and fishery workers, not afraid of difficulties and dangers, while fighting against nature, have always adhered to the combination of labor and military affairs, pulling nets with one hand and holding guns with the other, and have carried out heroic struggles against domestic and foreign class enemies.

    反映农垦、渔业战线高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗坚持社会主义方向的成就
    全国农业展览馆国营农场馆、水产馆开馆展出
    新华社四日讯　全国农业展览馆国营农场馆已在三日正式开馆展出。
    国营农场馆展出了我国农垦战线上的十五个先进典型单位，除新疆生产建设兵团以外，大多数是农场或农场的生产队，还展出了江西垦殖场所办的共产主义劳动大学。这些单位的先进事迹，充分反映了我国农垦事业在毛泽东思想指导下，正在沿着自己的道路不断前进。这条战线上的职工从我国的实际情况出发，坚持南泥湾的革命传统，发扬“大寨”的自力更生精神，走我国自己的道路，已经在边疆、沿海、山区或沙漠地区，从无到有，从小到大地建设起成片成批的农场、牧场、垦殖场以及许多半农半读的新型学校，对国家的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业作出了重大贡献。
    这次展出的十五个先进单位，通过大量的图片、资料、实物和模型，集中鲜明、生动有力地告诉观众，在我国农场的建场、办场和生产中存在着阶级斗争，存在着两条办场道路和两种办场思想的斗争。凡是按毛泽东思想办事，一切从实际情况出发，突出政治，发挥人的积极因素，敢于破旧立新，不受“洋框框”和“旧框框”的束缚，自力更生、艰苦奋斗，走自己的道路，这样农场就生气勃勃，蒸蒸日上，路子越走越宽，农场越办越好。这是这次展出的十五个先进单位的共同经验。
    这些先进单位的事迹和经验的展出，必将进一步推动和促进我国农垦事业的飞速发展。
    新华社五日讯　全国农业展览馆的水产馆在五月三日正式开馆展出。
    水产馆的展出，反映我国国营渔业和集体渔业生产队伍，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持社会主义的方向，坚持总路线和发扬大寨精神所取得的成就和发展。展出的二十五个典型单位中，大部分是近年来依靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗，使集体经济迅速发展壮大了的渔业公社或生产大队；此外还有勤俭办企业、事业，积极支持社队发展集体经济的国营渔业企业、事业单位；有革命化、战斗化的渔轮船队；还展出了几个单位的生产技术新成就。
    展出的这些先进单位的事迹，突出地反映了我国渔区的变化，渔业生产高涨和广大渔民和渔业职工革命热情高涨。在这里，人们可以看到：旧社会世世代代漂泊水上、生活极端贫困的渔民，在走上社会主义共同富裕的大道之后，发展了生产，建设了新渔村，有了不怕风吹浪打又能到外海捕鱼的机帆船；从而使他们对国家的贡献，对社会主义建设和改善人民生活的贡献越来越大。
    从这些先进单位的事迹中还可以看到，无论国营渔业或集体渔业都在自力更生地积极地改革技术，逐步向机械化方向前进。公社化以来，海洋捕捞使用的机帆船遍及沿海一百五十多个市县，机帆船的总马力比公社化前增加了五倍。渔区的渔船修造、网具制造和鱼货的加工、冷藏、运输，也逐步走上机械化作业。随着机械化程度的提高，渔场不断扩大，捕鱼种类增加，鱼产量上升，鱼货质量提高。同时，机械化作业，大大减轻了渔民的体力劳动强度，增强了抗御自然灾害的能力，保障安全作业。
    水产事业也要走中国自己的道路，也是这次展出先进典型的突出特点。事实证明，在发展渔业生产的同时，因地制宜地开展农林牧副多种经营，改变渔业的单一经营，能够充分发挥人力、物力的潜力，能够充分合理利用自然资源，做到渔农各业互相促进，抗御自然灾害，稳定收入，巩固集体经济，为国家创造更多的财富。水产馆展出的江苏如东县北坎公社黄海大队、浙江嵊泗县洋山公社滩浒岛渔业大队、黑龙江省肇东县东发公社东发渔业队等，在发展多种经营方面，已经走在前面，获得很大成绩。
    这个馆展出的先进单位中，有许多也是民兵工作先进单位。这说明我国的水产事业是在不断地斗争中成长壮大起来的。广大渔民和渔业职工，不怕困难，不畏艰险，在同大自然斗争的同时，始终坚持劳武结合，一手拉网，一手拿枪，同国内外阶级敌人进行了英勇的斗争。
