    Troops stationed in Shanghai sternly criticize "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial"
    "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial," "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are poisonous melons on a black vine. Revolutionary soldiers loyal to the Party and the people must smash these poisonous melons, cut off this poisonous vine, and dig up this poisonous root.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th -- The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai (including the Army, Navy, and Air Force) have held numerous discussion meetings in recent days and written articles for newspapers and radio stations, sternly criticizing and denouncing the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial." They pointed out that "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial," "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are poisonous melons on a black vine, and another poisonous arrow aimed at opposing the Party and socialism. Revolutionary soldiers loyal to the Party and the people will never let go of these monsters and demons, and must join with the broad masses of workers and peasants to smash these poisonous melons, cut off this poisonous vine, and dig up this poisonous root.
    Xu Xiang and Zhang Shengmin of a certain Air Force unit stationed in Shanghai wrote in an article: The corpse of Hai Rui, a feudal official who had been dead for hundreds of years, was given a new soul by Wu Han, Zhou Xinfang, and others, and successively brought to the stages of Shanghai and Beijing, echoing the anti-Party footsteps of right-leaning opportunists, singing discordant tunes, and employing different methods to oppose the Party and socialism. They, one in the south and one in the north, one "scolding" and one "dismissing," singing in unison, were truly "voices responding to each other and spirits seeking each other," two poisonous melons on a black vine of anti-Party and anti-socialism. The article pointed out that the momentum of the directors of "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial" was different from the ordinary: submitting a memorial carrying a coffin, showing the great determination to oppose the Party! Slandering the Party's leadership as being "terminally ill," showing the depth of hatred for the Party! "This memorial I submit will give him a jolt of awakening, a cold shower," "cold sweat pouring down like rain," showing the poisonousness of the anti-Party words! Claiming to use a "head-on blow" to beat the "dim-witted king" until he "vomits blood" and is "on the verge of death," showing the ruthlessness of the anti-Party methods! In the epilogue, when the curtain rises again, the stage is bathed in a myriad of rays of light, and a "petition of ten thousand people" appears on stage, with the crowd surrounding Hai Rui and singing loudly: "Speaking frankly about the most important thing in the world—the ruler values the people above all else, winning praise for thousands of years, praise for thousands of years!" This arrogantly declares that scolding is merely a means, and seizing power is the ultimate goal. Sheng Jingen, a five-good pilot of a certain Air Force unit, pointed out at a discussion meeting that "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial" is a poisonous arrow in the "national chess game" of right-leaning opportunists attacking the Party. They, along with their anti-Party partners in Beijing, viciously launched an attack on our beloved Party. At that time, how arrogant they were, colluding with each other from the south and the north, echoing each other from home and abroad, attempting to use the strategy of a counter-revolutionary "national chess game" to realize a counter-revolutionary restoration. Now, these "daring to speak, daring to write" "heroes," seeing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers wielded their mighty cudgels, want to spread blatant lies, saying that they have no connection with "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial," and vainly attempt to escape. This is impossible. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought; you will never escape your guilt!
    Yong Jingming of the East China Sea Fleet wrote in an article for Shanghai newspapers: Just as the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country was approaching, they used the excuse of "presenting a gift" to the Party and shot out this poisonous arrow, "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial." Their "gift" was offered to right-leaning opportunists who were frantically opposing the Party and socialism. The article said that in the ten years since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, great achievements have been made in all walks of life and on all fronts, and so many heroic and model figures have emerged. They do not write about them or sing their praises, but instead wrote "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial," and raised the faithful running dog of the landlord class, Hai Rui, who had been dead for hundreds of years, to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities, slandering us by saying "every household is clean," which is in the same tune as Deng Tuo and his ilk. This proves that they, Deng Tuo and his ilk, and right-leaning opportunists are completely birds of a feather.
    He Mingming, a soldier of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison District, angrily questioned the author of "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial": The revolutionary people's feelings for the Party, for Chairman Mao, and for socialism are as deep as the sea. We workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and people's soldiers are singing the praises of the Party and Chairman Mao everywhere. What are your intentions in saying "everyone curses the present"? What is your purpose in slandering the socialist system and attacking the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes? You vainly attempt to oppose the Party and overthrow the socialist world. We workers, peasants, and soldiers will never agree! Whoever dares to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, the people's soldiers will resolutely eliminate them.
    Xu Xiaozhong, a soldier of a certain unit of the East China Sea Fleet, wrote in an article entitled "Who Dares to Shake Our Ironclad Nation?": We are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants. We have suffered enough in the old society. Don't even think about dragging us back to the capitalist road! Whoever overestimates themselves will only get their heads bashed. We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force in the Great Cultural Revolution. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fight you to the end. You raise a "Hai Rui," and we will meet you with hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of "Mai Xiande." We can defeat enemies with guns, and we can also defeat you enemies without guns. If you come with force, we have guns; if you come with words, we have pens. Anti-Party and anti-socialist "Hai Ruis," choose what you want, but the ironclad socialist nation cannot be shaken by anyone!
    Miao Shengyuan, deputy company commander of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," said at a discussion meeting: "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial," like "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," directly aims its spearhead at our great Party. This is something we can never tolerate. In order to defend the Party, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, we must resolutely fight back and thoroughly defeat this gang of bad guys. Our Eighth Company has been stationed in Shanghai for more than ten years and has been fighting enemies without guns almost every day. Whether the class enemy is overt, covert, literary, or military, we can see through it and defeat it completely!
    Zhang Niuke, a squadron leader of a certain Air Force unit who performed meritorious service in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, said at a discussion meeting: The fact that such a big poisonous weed, "Hai Rui Submits a Memorial," was actually praised and applauded by a deputy minister of the Central Propaganda Department, who offered ideas for its creation, sent materials, and acted as their "backer," has aroused our great anger. He said that we are soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries did not get anything with their guns, and today this gang of black thugs should not even think about getting anything with their pens. We must drag out all these big and small monsters and demons, place them in broad daylight, and thoroughly defeat them!

    驻沪三军指战员严词批判《海瑞上疏》
    《海瑞上疏》和《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》是一根黑藤上的毒瓜。忠于党忠于人民的革命战士，一定要捣碎这些毒瓜，斩断这根毒藤，挖掉这条毒根。
    新华社上海二十九日电　中国人民解放军驻上海陆海空军广大指战员，连日纷纷举行座谈，向报纸和广播电台写文章，严词批判和痛斥《海瑞上疏》这株大毒草。他们指出：《海瑞上疏》和《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》是一根黑藤上的毒瓜，是又一支反党反社会主义的毒箭。忠于党忠于人民的革命战士，决不放过这些牛鬼蛇神，一定要同广大工农群众一起，捣碎这些毒瓜，斩断这根毒藤，挖掉这条毒根。
    驻上海空军某部徐翔、张生民在一篇文章里写道：一具已经死了几百年的封建官吏海瑞的僵尸，被吴晗、周信芳等人换上了自己的灵魂，先后搬上了上海、北京的舞台，应和着右倾机会主义分子的反党脚步，大唱反调，采用不同的手法，来反党反社会主义。他们一南一北，一“骂”一“罢”，一唱一和，真是“同声相应同气相求”，是反党反社会主义这根黑藤上的两个毒瓜。文章指出，《海瑞上疏》编导者的气势汹汹，不同一般：抬着棺材上疏，可见其反党决心之大！诬蔑党的领导“病入膏肓”，可见其对党仇恨之深！“我这道疏本，管叫他醍醐灌顶，冷水浇头”，“冷汗如雨”，可见其反党言词之毒！声称要用“当头棒”把“昏王”打得“吐血”和“奄奄一息”，可见其反党手段之狠！尾声中，幕再启时，霞光万道，台上出现“万民伞”一把，众百姓围绕海瑞高唱：“直言天下第一事——君轻民为重，博得个千秋称颂，千秋称颂！”这就狂妄地宣布了骂不过是手段，夺权才是目的。空军某部五好飞行员盛金根在座谈会上指出，《海瑞上疏》是右倾机会主义分子向党进攻的“全国一盘棋”中的一支毒箭。他们和北京的反党伙伴们一起，恶毒地向我们敬爱的党发起了攻击。那时候，他们是何等嚣张，南边的、北边的串通一气，国内的、国外的遥相呼应，妄想用反革命的“全国一盘棋”的策略，实现反革命复辟。现在，这些“敢说，敢写”的“英雄”，看到广大工农兵抡起了千钧棒，又想撒弥天大谎，说自己和《海瑞上疏》没有联系，妄想逃之夭夭，这是办不到的。我们工农兵有毛泽东思想的强大武器，你们休想逃避罪责！
    海军东海舰队雍景明在写给上海报纸的一篇文章中指出：正当建国十周年的时候，他们借口向党“献礼”，射出了《海瑞上疏》这支毒箭。他们的“礼”是献给疯狂反党反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子的。文章说，解放十年来，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，各行各业各条战线上都取得了巨大成绩，涌现出那么多英雄模范人物，他们都不写，不歌颂，却写了个《海瑞上疏》，抬出死了几百年的地主阶级的忠实走狗海瑞来，进行反党反社会主义罪恶活动，诬蔑我们“家家户户，干干净净”，这与邓拓之流的咒骂是一个腔调。这证明他们与邓拓之流，与右倾机会主义分子完全是一丘之貉。
    上海警备区某部战士贺明明愤怒责问《海瑞上疏》的作者：革命人民对党对毛主席对社会主义感情象海一样深，我们工人、贫下中农、人民战士，到处都在歌颂党和毛主席，你们胡说“人人咒骂当今”，究竟是何居心？你们诬蔑社会主义制度，攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，又是何种目的？你们妄想反对党，推翻社会主义天下，我们工农兵坚决不答应！谁敢反党反社会主义，人民战士就坚决消灭它。
    东海舰队某部战士徐效忠在题为《谁敢撼动我们铁打的江山？》一文中写道：我们是贫、下中农的子弟，旧社会的苦我们已经受够了，要把我们拖回资本主义老路去，休想！谁要是自不量力，只会碰得头破血流。我们工农兵是文化大革命中的主力军，我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决与你们斗到底。你们抬出一个“海瑞”，我们就迎上几百个几千个几万个“麦贤得”。我们既能打败拿枪的敌人，同样也能打败你们这些不拿枪的敌人。武的来，我们有枪杆；文的来，我们有笔杆。反党反社会主义的“海瑞”们，要文要武请便吧，铁打的社会主义江山是任何人所撼动不了的！
    “南京路上好八连”副连长苗生元在座谈会上说：《海瑞上疏》象《海瑞骂皇帝》一样，把矛头直接指向我们伟大的党。这是我们决不能容忍的。为了保卫党，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫毛泽东思想，我们要坚决给予反击，彻底斗倒这伙坏蛋。我们八连进驻上海十多年来，几乎每天都在和不拿枪的敌人作斗争。无论阶级敌人是明的、暗的、文的、武的，我们都能识破它，把它斗倒斗垮！
    在抗美援朝战争中荣立战功的空军某部大队长张牛科在座谈会上说：《海瑞上疏》这样一棵反党反社会主义的大毒草，居然受到中央宣传部的一个副部长称赞、叫好，为它的出笼出点子，送资料，做他们的“靠山”，更激起了我们的极大愤怒。他说，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，过去美帝国主义和国民党反动派用枪杆子没有得到什么东西，今天这伙黑帮也休想用笔杆子得到。我们一定要把这些大大小小的牛鬼蛇神统统揪出来，放在光天化日之下，彻底斗倒！
