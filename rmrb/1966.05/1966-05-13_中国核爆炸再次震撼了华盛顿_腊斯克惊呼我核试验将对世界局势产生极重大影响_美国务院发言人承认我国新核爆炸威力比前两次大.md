    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th - News: China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear material has once again shaken Washington. While the U.S. officialdom expressed panic and unease, they also tried to downplay the significance of this explosion.

    U.S. Secretary of State Rusk learned of this Chinese nuclear explosion on the 9th near the end of his testimony before the U.S. Senate on foreign aid. He exclaimed that China's nuclear explosion "will have extremely serious repercussions on the situation." But he pretended to be calm and said, "I don't believe this third explosion will have a more serious impact on the Southeast Asian situation than the first explosion."

    On the same day, the U.S. State Department also hurriedly issued a statement, feigning calm and stating that it was not "surprised" by China's nuclear test. It invoked the Moscow Three-Nation Treaty, aimed at maintaining U.S.-Soviet nuclear hegemony, to attack China, expressing some kind of "regret." This statement was obviously worried that China's nuclear explosion had heavily struck the United States' position among its vassal states, and therefore waved nuclear weapons again, carrying out nuclear blackmail, reiterating the United States' "defense obligations to Asia," and reiterating that the United States will provide its Asian vassals with "strong support" of nuclear weapons.

    U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey, on the 11th, once again spoke about China's new nuclear test, and had to admit that the power of China's third nuclear explosion was "greater than the previous two tests." At the same time, McCloskey once again announced that the U.S. government rejected China's proposal to convene a summit conference of heads of state from all countries to discuss the comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

    United Press International on the 11th, citing U.S. "government sources," admitted that the power of China's third nuclear explosion was much greater than the United States initially estimated. The news also said that U.S. experts believe that China is moving towards thermonuclear nation status faster than U.S. government officials had anticipated.

    United Press International reporter Hansley, in a message from Washington on the 9th, said, "Although Rusk made an impromptu statement that China's third successful test would not have any 'serious impact' on the Southeast Asian issue, it is reported that the U.S. government is concerned about the psychological impact of this test." This message pointed out that U.S. government officials are worried that the growth of China's defense forces will make the United States more isolated in expanding its war of aggression. It said officials worried: "The proven facts of China's progress may make some of the United States' allies worry about whether it is wise to risk offending Beijing."

    Although an Associated Press report from Tokyo on the 10th maliciously attacked China, it admitted that China's "development in this area has extremely great significance for the balance of power in the world, especially in Asia."

    中国核爆炸再次震撼了华盛顿
    腊斯克惊呼我核试验将对世界局势产生极重大影响
    美国务院发言人承认我国新核爆炸威力比前两次大
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：中国进行含有热核材料的核爆炸成功再一次震撼了华盛顿。美国官方一方面表现出惊慌不安，一方面又力图缩小这次爆炸的意义。
    美国国务卿腊斯克九日在美国参议院就援外问题作证即将结束时获知这次中国核爆炸的消息。他惊呼中国的这次核爆炸“将对局势产生极其严重的反响”。但是他又装作镇静地说，“我不相信，这第三次爆炸会对东南亚局势具有比第一次爆炸更严重的影响”。
    同一天，美国国务院也急忙发表声明，故作镇静地表示对中国的核试验并不“感到惊异”。它援引旨在保持美苏核霸王地位的莫斯科三国条约攻击中国，表示什么“遗憾”。这项声明显然担心中国的核爆炸沉重地打击了美国在它的仆从国家中的地位，因而再次挥舞核武器，进行核讹诈，重申美国“对亚洲承担的防御义务”，重申美国将对它的亚洲仆从提供核武器的“有力的支持”。
    美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基十一日再次就中国新的核试验发表谈话，不得不承认，中国第三次核爆炸的威力“比前两次的试验大”。同时，麦克洛斯基又一次宣布美国政府拒绝中国关于召开世界各国首脑会议讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的建议。
    合众国际社十一日引美国“政府人士”的话承认，中国的第三次核爆炸，其威力比美国最初估计的要大得多。消息还说，美国专家认为，中国走向热核国家地位的速度比美国政府官员所预料的要快得多。
    合众国际社记者汉斯莱在九日从华盛顿发出的消息中说，“尽管腊斯克发表即席声明，认为中国第三次成功的试验不会对东南亚问题产生任何‘严重影响’，可是据悉美国政府担心这次试验的心理上影响”。这条消息指出，美国政府官员担心，中国国防力量的增长将使得美国在扩大侵略战争方面更加陷于孤立。它说，官员们担心：“中国取得进展的实据，可能使得美国的一些盟国对于冒惹怒北京的风险是否明智感到忧虑”。
    美联社十日发自东京的报道尽管恶意地攻击中国，但是它承认，中国“在这方面的发展，对世界、特别是亚洲的力量对比具有极为巨大的意义。”
