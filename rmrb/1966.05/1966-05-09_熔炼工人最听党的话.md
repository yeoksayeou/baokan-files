    Smelting workers listen to the Party the most, doing whatever the Party tells them to do. We smelt as much steel as the motherland needs, and we process as many machine tools as the people require. Smelting workers listen to the Party the most, taking revolutionary strides forward, unafraid of wind or rain, scaling the heights of technology with flying colors. Smelting workers listen to the Party the most, fearing neither heaven nor earth, forging ahead in the face of difficulties, wielding iron chisels with great enthusiasm! Smelting workers listen to the Party the most, managing the household diligently and thriftily, dedicating ourselves to revolution with a red heart, promoting both ideological and practical work.
