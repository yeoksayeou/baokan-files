    Peel off the "Authority" Skin, Open Fire on "Authority"
    Zhou Xinli
    *Wenhui Bao* Editor's Note: Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's article "Arming Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought" and Comrade Zhou Xinli's article "Discussing the Philosophical Problems of Selling Watermelons in Big Cities" were unexpectedly criticized by certain so-called "authorities" as typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism." Comrade Zhou Xinli specifically wrote an article to forcefully refute these erroneous viewpoints with vivid facts. Some coaches and athletes of the Shanghai Municipal Ping Pong Team also recently held a symposium to criticize this absurd accusation. We must have the courage to criticize and overthrow all fallacies that oppose Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how great the "authority" is. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and work harder to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to break through, dare to do, and dare to revolt.
    On May 14, *Liberation Army Daily* and *Guangming Daily* republished Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's "Arming Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought" and my article "Discussing the Philosophical Problems of Selling Watermelons in Big Cities," adding editor's notes. This is the Party's great concern and encouragement for us. I must work even harder to study Chairman Mao's works in the future, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and further improve my thinking and work.
    Here, I will talk about the process of writing this article at that time. It was the summer of 1964 when the Zhabei District Committee of the CCP organized us cadres to study Chairman Mao's two philosophical works, "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." I was inspired and educated by studying Chairman Mao's works, and I realized that to do a good job of selling watermelons, we must dare to expose contradictions, dare to recognize contradictions, and dare to solve contradictions; and we must also be good at grasping the main contradictions and resolutely solving them, so that they can be transformed in a direction that is beneficial to the cause of socialist revolution. Through study, I gained confidence in solving the difficulty of having too many watermelons that rotted easily. Under the leadership of the company's Party general branch, we organized the vast number of cadres to fully expose the contradictions in the work of selling watermelons. At the same time, in response to the difficulties and fears of some cadres and workers in the work of selling watermelons, such as being afraid of having too many and being afraid of rotting, we organized them to study Chairman Mao's articles "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Concentrate a Superior Force to Destroy the Enemy Forces One by One." Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers greatly improved their class consciousness, understood that doing commercial work is doing revolution, and established the idea of selling melons for the revolution. During the entire "Watermelon Campaign," I participated in the battle with the workers, and was deeply infected by the workers' revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or fatigue. In the process of selling watermelons continuously for more than a month, the vast number of cadres and workers, with a fighting posture, sold melons for the revolution, and many good people and good deeds emerged. For example, during a typhoon and rainstorm at the end of July, in order to protect state property and prevent the watermelons in the cabin from rotting, those who carried the watermelons on the dock included the Party branch secretaries, managers, accounting personnel, and salespersons of the grassroots stores, old and young, male and female. This scene of fiery enthusiasm moved me to tears. This made me deeply realize that the reason why the work of selling watermelons could achieve some success was entirely due to the incomparably powerful power of Mao Zedong Thought. After the work of selling watermelons and melons was completed, under the care and encouragement of the higher-level Party, in order to sing the praises of our great Party, sing the praises of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and sing the praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought; in order to summarize past experiences and guide future work, combined with my own experience in studying Chairman Mao's works and transforming the subjective world and the objective world, I wrote the article "Discussing the Philosophical Problems of Selling Watermelons in Big Cities." I started writing in November of that year. In the process of writing, in order to highlight the incomparably powerful power of Mao Zedong Thought, in order to truthfully reflect the heroic spirit of the vast number of workers in overcoming difficulties under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, I conducted investigations and research, and revised the manuscript many times, until the final draft was completed on December 26. Later, *Academic Monthly* published my article, and the workers in our company and I myself were encouraged, further saw the direction, and prompted us to better creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.
    But unexpectedly, the articles written by Comrade Zhuang Jiafu and me were criticized by certain so-called "authorities" as typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism." The vast number of workers in our company were very angry when they heard this news, and I was also very angry. We want to ask those "authorities," have you participated in our activities of studying Chairman Mao's works? No! Have you ever stood behind our store counter? No! Have you ever carried a watermelon or sold a watermelon? No! Have the vast number of workers, under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, rapidly improved their class consciousness, continuously carried forward their revolutionary spirit, and gradually established the idea of serving the people, do you see that? No! You don't understand any of these actual situations. Then, why would our article, which truthfully reflects the masses' creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, cause you to scold it so harshly? Why do you criticize it as a typical example of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism"? The problem is very clear: you are opposing the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought in the name of criticizing these two articles, opposing the workers, peasants, and soldiers creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, opposing the workers, peasants, and soldiers learning and applying philosophy, and opposing the workers, peasants, and soldiers occupying the academic positions monopolized by you.
    We want to ask, what are your intentions in accusing the workers, peasants, and soldiers of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism"? What is your purpose? Chairman Mao taught us: "For the theory of Marxism, we must be able to master it and apply it, and the purpose of mastering it is entirely for application." Our proletarian philosophy is a revolutionary philosophy, and Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for guiding the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. In order to master Chairman Mao's works, the most important thing is to work hard on the word "use," use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our non-proletarian thinking, and to improve our revolutionary work. We study Chairman Mao's works, learn a little, use a little, and we are enlightened when we learn, and it is effective when we use it. Chairman Mao's words speak our hearts, educating us on how to establish a proletarian revolutionary outlook on life, and educating us on how to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao's books are the highest instructions for us to do all revolutionary work well, and we must listen carefully to every sentence of Chairman Mao's words and do everything according to them. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the revolution. You so-called "authorities" turn a blind eye to the facts. Hundreds of thousands of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have studied Mao Zedong Thought and creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, promoting the ideological revolutionization of people and promoting the leap-forward development of our country's socialist revolution and construction. The Chinese Ping Pong Team creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. The men's team has won world championships for several consecutive years, and the women's team has turned the tables and defeated foreign strong teams, do you know that? Our People's Liberation Army, scientific and technological personnel, and the vast number of workers creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and successfully carried out three nuclear explosions, do you know that? The people of Daqing creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, starting with the "Two Essays," making our country self-sufficient in oil and shedding the "oil-poor" label, do you know that? The people of Dazhai creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and their heroic deeds of daring to struggle and daring to win, do you know that? Take our unit as an example. Comrade Dai Xiuying, a "six-good" apprentice in the Beizhan Fruit Store who has only been in the store for six months and is only nineteen years old, studied Chairman Mao's works, understood that commercial work is also revolutionary work, and, in her ordinary post, is not afraid of hardship or fatigue, and gradually established the idea of standing behind the counter for the revolution for the rest of her life. Comrade Yu Afu, a "six-good" worker, although with a low level of education, actively organizes the masses to study Chairman Mao's works and carry out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology, so that the consciousness of the workers in the store is constantly improved. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have performed thousands of revolutionary heroic deeds that cannot be fully described or fully sung. Why do you "authorities" turn a blind eye to the facts and instead want to slander and attack the workers, peasants, and soldiers for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism"? Learning Mao Zedong Thought is "vulgarization," and using Mao Zedong Thought to promote revolutionary work is "pragmatism." These are two black phrases and two clubs of you "authorities" to oppose the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works. Under the leadership of the Party, our revolutionary people must completely smash your two black phrases and resolutely knock down your two clubs.
    Currently, our country is launching a high tide of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers have the deepest feelings and the strongest love for Chairman Mao's works. We must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought to promote our ideological revolutionization; we must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world and promote the development of the cause of socialist revolution and construction; we must use Mao Zedong Thought to brighten our eyes, distinguish between truth and falsehood, to see through, expose, and smash all the plots of demons and monsters against the Party and against socialism; we must use Mao Zedong Thought as a beacon to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, eradicate the social foundation of revisionism, and resolutely prevent the restoration of capitalism in our country. You "authorities" and "experts" certainly do not dare to openly oppose us mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Nor do you have the "courage" to do so. But because you stand on the reactionary bourgeois position and have a black heart that opposes Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible not to show it. Therefore, you use the pretext of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism" to attack and slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. If our workers, peasants, and soldiers are fooled by you and do not arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, bourgeois ideas will corrupt us, and revisionism will be produced in our country, leading to the restoration of capitalism. Your purpose is obvious to everyone. You don't want us to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, so what do you want us to learn? Could it be that you want us to learn the bourgeois stuff? Learn the revisionist stuff? This is a big conspiracy! This is clearing the way for corrupt bourgeois ideology and reactionary revisionist ideology, attempting to realize the restoration of capitalism in our country. The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never be fooled by you. No matter how insidious and cunning you "authorities" are, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to see through and expose your conspiracies. We must warn the "authorities" that opposing the study of Chairman Mao's works is opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing revolution.
    Currently, our country is undergoing a socialist cultural revolution of great historical significance. This is the key issue for the in-depth development of the socialist revolution in our country at the present stage, and it is a life-and-death class struggle. We must use the great Mao Zedong Thought to completely smash and completely destroy the black shop and black talk of the "Three-Family Village." But you so-called "authorities" are trying to prevent us from studying Chairman Mao's works, so that we cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood, and distinguish between right and wrong. What position do you stand on? You consider yourselves "authorities" and scold and scold, what kind of attitude is this? Everyone knows that those who scold us are imperialism headed by US imperialism, revisionism, the reactionaries of all countries, and domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all demons and monsters. Who are you scolding? You are scolding the mass movement of the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and you are scolding the great Mao Zedong Thought. The more you scold, the more it proves that we are doing the right thing, and the more we must love Chairman Mao's works, and the more we must strive to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must launch a tit-for-tat struggle with you so-called "authorities." Chairman Mao taught and encouraged us in this way: "'Dare to unhorse the emperor,' we must have this spirit of dauntlessness when we fight for socialism and communism." In this socialist cultural revolution, in this life-and-death class struggle, how much we need this revolutionary fighting spirit! No matter what "authority" you are, no matter how high your position is, no matter what banner you are holding, no matter what flowery words you are using, no matter what conspiracies you are using, if you want to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, if you want to scold Mao Zedong Thought, we will trample all of you under our feet and clear the stumbling blocks on the road of revolutionary advance. In this life-and-death class struggle, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strive to realize ideological revolutionization and work revolutionization, take the scales in one hand and the pen in the other, completely smash the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and resolutely carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end. We will never stop until we win a complete victory!

    剥“权威”画皮　向“权威”开火
    周信礼
    《文汇报》编者按：庄家富同志写的《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》和周信礼同志写的《谈谈大城市卖西瓜的哲学问题》这两篇文章，竟被某些所谓“权威”指责为“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型。周信礼同志特写了文章，以生动的事实，有力地驳斥了这些谬误的论点。上海市乒乓球队的部分教练和运动员们也在最近举行了座谈会，对这个荒谬的指责进行了批判。凡是一切反对毛泽东思想的谬论，不管他是多大的“权威”，我们都要有勇气批判它，打倒它。我们要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢做、敢革命。
    五月十四日《解放军报》、《光明日报》重新发表了乒乓球运动员庄家富同志写的《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》和我写的《谈谈大城市卖西瓜的哲学问题》，还加了编者按。这是党对我们的极大的关怀和鼓励。我今后一定要更加努力学习毛主席著作，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，进一步提高思想，改进工作。
    这里我谈谈当时写作这篇文章的经过。那是一九六四年夏天，中共闸北区委组织我们干部学习毛主席的《实践论》、《矛盾论》两篇哲学著作。我从学习毛主席著作的过程中，得到了启发，受到了教育，认识到要把卖西瓜的工作搞好，就要敢于揭露矛盾，敢于认识矛盾，敢于解决矛盾；又要善于抓住主要矛盾狠狠地加以解决，使它朝着有利于社会主义革命事业的方向转化。通过学习，我对解决当时存在的西瓜多而且容易烂的困难增加了信心。在公司党总支的领导下，我们组织广大干部充分揭发卖西瓜工作中的矛盾，同时又针对当时部分干部与职工群众在卖西瓜工作中有怕多、怕烂等畏难思想，组织他们学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》等文章。职工群众在毛泽东思想的教育下，大大提高了阶级觉悟，懂得了干商业工作就是干革命，树立了为革命卖瓜的思想。在整个“西瓜战役”过程中，我同职工群众一起参加战斗，深为职工群众不怕苦、不怕累的革命精神所感染。在连续一个多月卖西瓜的过程中，广大干部和职工群众以战斗的姿态，为革命卖瓜，出现了很多的好人好事。例如在七月底一次台风暴雨中，为了保护国家财产，不使船舱内西瓜腐烂变质，在码头上搬运西瓜的，有基层商店的党支部书记、经理、财会人员、营业员，有老有少，有男有女。这种热火朝天的场面，使我感动得流了泪。这使我深刻地体会到卖西瓜的工作所以能够取得一些成绩，完全是来自毛泽东思想的无比强大的威力。卖西瓜、甜瓜工作结束后，在上级党的关怀与鼓舞下，为了歌颂我们伟大的党，歌颂我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想；为了总结过去的经验，指导今后的工作，结合我自己学习毛主席著作、改造主观世界与客观世界的体会，写了《谈谈大城市卖西瓜的哲学问题》的文章。我是在当年十一月开始动笔的。在写作过程中，为了突出毛泽东思想的无比强大的威力，为了如实反映广大职工群众在毛泽东思想教育下，敢于克服困难的英雄气概，我进行了调查研究，先后多次易稿，直到十二月二十六日最后定稿。后来《学术月刊》发表了我的文章，我们公司的职工和我自己都受到了鼓舞，进一步看清了方向，促使我们更好地活学活用毛主席著作。
    但是想不到，庄家富同志和我所写的文章，竟被某些所谓“权威”指责为“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型。我们公司广大职工群众听到这个消息后很气愤，我亦是非常气愤。我们要问那些“权威”，你们参加过我们学习毛主席著作的活动吗？没有！你们到过我们商店站过一次柜台吗？没有！你们搬过一只西瓜、卖过一只西瓜吗？没有！我们广大职工群众在毛泽东思想教育下，阶级觉悟迅速提高，革命精神不断发扬，为人民服务的思想逐步确立，你们看到吗？没有！你们统统不了解这些实际情况。那末，我们如实反映群众活学活用毛泽东思想的文章，为什么会引起你们的大骂呢？你们为什么要指责它是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型呢？问题很清楚，你们以指责这两篇文章为名，反对工农兵掌握毛泽东思想，反对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，反对工农兵学哲学、用哲学，反对工农兵占领被你们所垄断的学术阵地。
    我们要问，你们指责工农兵活学活用毛主席著作为“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，居心何在？用意何在？毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”我们无产阶级的哲学，是革命的哲学，毛泽东思想是指导阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的最强大、最锐利的思想武器。为了把毛主席著作学到手，最重要的就是要在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的非无产阶级思想，来改进我们的革命工作。我们学习毛主席著作，学一点，用一点，学了开窍，用了就灵。毛主席的话，讲的是我们心里话，教育我们怎样树立无产阶级革命人生观，教育我们怎样把社会主义革命进行到底。毛主席的书是我们做好一切革命工作的最高指示，毛主席的话我们句句要认真听、句句要照着做，我们干革命靠的就是毛泽东思想。你们这些所谓“权威”睁着眼不看事实，成千成万的工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子，学习了毛泽东思想、活学活用毛主席著作，促进了人的思想革命化，促进了我国社会主义革命与建设事业的飞跃发展。中国乒乓球队，活学活用毛主席著作，男队连续几届获得世界冠军，女队翻身，打败外国强手，你们知道吗？我们的解放军、科学技术人员和广大职工，活学活用毛主席著作，成功地进行了三次核爆炸，你们知道吗？大庆人活学活用毛主席著作，“两论”起家，使我国石油自给，甩掉“贫油”的帽子，你们知道吗？大寨人活学活用毛主席著作，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄事迹，你们知道吗？就以我们单位来说，北站果品商店一位进店仅六个月、年龄仅十九岁的六好艺徒戴秀英同志，学习了毛主席著作，懂得了商业工作亦是革命工作，在平凡的岗位上，不怕苦，不怕累，逐步树立了要为革命站一辈子柜台的思想。六好职工俞阿富同志，虽然文化程度很低，但积极组织群众学习毛主席著作，开展兴无灭资斗争，使店内职工群众觉悟不断提高。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，做出了成千成万的革命英雄事迹，这是说也说不完、唱也唱不完的。你们这些“权威”为什么睁着眼看不见事实，反而要污蔑、攻击工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是“庸俗化”、“实用主义”呢？学毛泽东思想是“庸俗化”，用毛泽东思想促进革命工作是“实用主义”，这是你们这些“权威”反对工农兵学习毛主席著作的两句黑话、两根棍子。我们革命人民在党的领导下，要彻底粉碎你们这两句黑话，坚决打掉你们这两根棍子。
    当前，我国正在掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。广大工农兵对毛主席著作有着最深挚的感情和最强烈的热爱。我们要以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，促使自己的思想革命化；我们要以毛泽东思想改造客观世界，促进社会主义革命和建设事业的发展；我们要以毛泽东思想擦亮眼睛、辨别真伪，来识破、揭露与粉碎一切牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义的阴谋；我们要以毛泽东思想为指路明灯，把社会主义革命进行到底，铲除修正主义的社会基础，坚决防止在我国发生资本主义复辟。你们这些“权威”、“专家”当然不敢公开反对我们掌握毛泽东思想，量你们也没有这种“胆量”。但由于你们站在反动的资产阶级立场，怀有一颗反毛泽东思想的黑心，不表现出来是不可能的，于是就借口“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，攻击、污蔑工农兵活学活用毛主席著作。如果我们工农兵上你们的当，不以毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，资产阶级思想就会腐蚀我们，就会使我国产生修正主义，导致资本主义复辟。你们的目的，是司马昭之心路人皆知。不要我们活学活用毛主席著作，那末要我们学什么？难道说，学资产阶级那一套吗？学修正主义那一套吗？这是一个大阴谋！这是为资产阶级腐朽思想意识、修正主义反动思想鸣锣开道，妄图在我国实现资本主义复辟。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民决不会上你们的当。不管你们这些“权威”是多么阴险狡猾，我们一定要以毛泽东思想来识破和揭露你们的阴谋诡计。我们要正告“权威”，反对学习毛主席著作，就是反对毛泽东思想，就是反对革命。
    当前，我国正在进行着一场具有伟大历史意义的社会主义文化大革命，这是现阶段我国社会主义革命深入发展的关键问题，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我们一定要以伟大的毛泽东思想来彻底粉碎、彻底捣毁“三家村”的黑店黑话。而你们这些所谓“权威”却妄想阻挡我们学习毛主席著作，使我们不能辨别真伪，分清是非。你们究竟站在什么立场？你们以“权威”自居，大骂特骂，这究竟是什么态度？谁都知道，骂我们的是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，是修正主义，是各国反动派，是国内地富反坏右和一切牛鬼蛇神。你们究竟骂的谁？是骂广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是骂伟大的毛泽东思想。你们越骂，越证明我们做的对，我们越要热爱毛主席著作，越要努力活学活用毛主席著作。我们一定要和你们这些所谓“权威”，展开针锋相对的斗争。毛主席这样教导、鼓励我们：“‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”在这场社会主义文化大革命中，在这场你死我活的阶级斗争中，我们多么需要这种革命的战斗的精神！不管你们是什么“权威”，不管你们有多高的地位，不管你们打着什么旗号，不管你们搬弄什么花言巧语，不管你们施展什么阴谋诡计，你们要反对毛泽东思想，你们要骂毛泽东思想，我们就要统统把你们踩在脚下，扫清革命前进道路上的绊脚石。我们要在这一场你死我活的阶级斗争中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，努力实现思想革命化和工作革命化，一手拿秤杆，一手拿笔杆，彻底粉碎反党反社会主义的黑线，将社会主义文化大革命坚决进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
