    Defending the Dictatorship of the Proletariat is the Top Priority
    Liu Yin-fu, Deputy Director of the Preparation Workshop, Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill
    Recently, after studying the *Liberation Army Daily*'s editorial "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution," I have gained a further understanding of the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie that is currently underway in our country's ideological sphere. This is by no means just a matter of a few articles, a few scripts, or a few movies; nor is it simply an academic debate in academic and cultural circles. This is a life-and-death class struggle, a top priority concerning the defense of the proletariat's power, a top priority concerning the fate and future of our Party and country, and a top priority concerning the future of the world revolution.
    Chairman Mao often taught us that classes and class struggle still exist in socialist society. As everyone knows, after the proletariat seizes revolutionary power, the state apparatus, including the army, is in our hands. The class enemies do not dare to confront us openly with swords and guns, but adopt more insidious, more vicious, and more covert methods, attempting to capture us ideologically and in our daily lives, using the bourgeois world outlook to transform us, realize peaceful evolution, and achieve capitalist restoration. The class enemies use this invisible knife to try to achieve what they cannot achieve by force. Class enemies always engage in bourgeois ideological infiltration before carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration, using their reactionary world outlook to control people spiritually. We must never ignore the current class struggle in the ideological sphere. Never think that a few small fish cannot cause big waves. This is a frenzied attack by bourgeois ideology and revisionist ideology on the proletariat, the Party, socialism, and Marxism. This is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between Marxism and anti-Marxism.
    We, the working class, are the masters of the country, the leading class of the revolution, and have been the main force of the revolution in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. In the current stage of the socialist cultural revolution, we, the working class, are still the main force. We suffered from the oppression of the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and we understand class and class struggle best. We, the working class, are the creators of material and spiritual wealth, and we are the most knowledgeable. We have become masters economically and politically, and we must also become masters of culture. We creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and have mastered the sharpest weapons of struggle. We, the working class, have the greatest responsibility and are also the most qualified to participate in the socialist cultural revolution. Here, I solemnly warn all kinds of class enemies, no matter where you are hiding, whether in academic circles, education circles, news circles, art circles... no matter what false revolutionary or false Marxist masks you wear, we, the working class, will also drag you out and thoroughly criticize and discredit your anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Marxist ideas!

    保卫无产阶级专政的头等大事
    天津国棉三厂准备车间副主任　刘荫福
    最近，我学习了《解放军报》的《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》社论以后，对于目前我国意识形态领域中正在进行的无产阶级和资产阶级的思想斗争，有了进一步的认识。这绝不仅仅是几篇文章、几个剧本、几部电影的问题；也绝不仅仅是学术界、文化界的学术争论问题。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，是关系到保卫无产阶级印把子的头等大事；是关系到我们党和国家命运和前途的头等大事；也是关系到世界革命前途的一件头等大事。
    毛主席经常教导我们，社会主义社会还存在阶级和阶级斗争。大家知道，无产阶级取得革命政权以后，军队等国家机器都在我们手中。阶级敌人不敢和我们明摆着刀对刀、枪对枪的干，而采取更阴险、更毒辣、更隐蔽的手法，妄图从思想上、生活上俘虏我们，用资产阶级世界观来改造我们，实现和平演变，实现资本主义复辟。阶级敌人用这把杀人不见血的刀子，企图达到他们用武力所不能达到的目的。阶级敌人搞反革命复辟总是先搞资产阶级思想渗透，用他们的反动世界观，把人从精神上控制起来。我们千万不可忽视当前在意识形态领域内的阶级斗争。千万不要认为几条小鱼翻不起大浪。这是资产阶级思潮、修正主义思潮向无产阶级、向党、向社会主义、向马克思主义的猖狂进攻。这是一场无产阶级与资产阶级、马克思主义和反马克思主义的你死我活的斗争。
    我们工人阶级是国家主人，是革命的领导阶级，在民主革命、社会主义革命中都是革命的主力军。在现阶段社会主义文化大革命中，我们工人阶级仍然是主力军。我们过去身受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山压迫，我们最懂得阶级、阶级斗争。我们工人阶级是物质财富和精神财富的创造者，我们最有知识。我们在经济上政治上做了主人，也要做文化的主人。我们活学活用毛主席著作，掌握了最锐利的斗争武器。我们工人阶级最有责任，同时也最有资格参加社会主义文化大革命。我这里郑重地警告形形色色的阶级敌人，不管你们隐藏在学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界……，不管你们披着什么假革命、假马克思主义的画皮，我们工人阶级也要把你们揪出来，把你们反党、反社会主义、反马克思主义的思想批透、斗臭！
