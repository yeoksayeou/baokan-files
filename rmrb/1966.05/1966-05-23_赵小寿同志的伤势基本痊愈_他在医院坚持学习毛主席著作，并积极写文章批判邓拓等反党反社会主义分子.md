    Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd -- Since the heroic diplomatic warrior Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, who was seriously injured while protecting the national flag, returned to the motherland, people across the country have been very concerned about him, writing letters to inquire about his health. Therefore, the reporter made a special visit to the attending doctor treating Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou at the hospital.
    According to the doctor, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou's condition has basically recovered. Based on his current health, he will be discharged from the hospital soon.
    When Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou was first admitted to the hospital, he was extremely anemic, with four right ribs fractured, blood clots in the chest cavity, wound infection, and shrapnel under the skin of his back. After treatment, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou's hemoglobin has returned to normal, the blood clots have been cleared, the ribs and wounds have basically healed, the right lung is in good condition, and the shrapnel has been removed.

Recently, he studied "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" written by Chairman Mao in connection with the current situation. He is very concerned about the domestic and international situation, reading newspapers and listening to the radio every day without interruption since being admitted to the hospital. He carefully read the articles published in the newspapers recently criticizing Deng Tuo and other anti-Party, anti-socialist elements and actively wrote articles to participate in the criticism. He said that Deng Tuo and this small group of anti-Party, anti-socialist gangs want to carry out "peaceful evolution" in our country, which we will resolutely not allow and must thoroughly defeat.
