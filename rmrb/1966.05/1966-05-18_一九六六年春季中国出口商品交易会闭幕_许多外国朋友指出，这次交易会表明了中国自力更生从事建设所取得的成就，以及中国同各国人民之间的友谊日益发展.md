    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 17th: The 1966 Spring Chinese Export Commodities Fair closed here on the 15th.
    This fair had the largest number of foreign merchants, the widest range of regions represented, and the most new customers since the Chinese Export Commodities Fair began in the spring of 1957. There was a significant increase in guests from Asian and African countries and regions compared to previous fairs. Burma, Cambodia, Ceylon, Sudan, Congo (Brazzaville), and Tanzania sent government trade delegations, government officials, or representatives of state-owned companies to participate in this fair. Merchants from Asian and African regions such as Masqat and Oman, Aden, and Sierra Leone attended the Chinese Export Commodities Fair for the first time.
    The overall upsurge of our national economy enabled various parts of the country to provide ample export materials for this fair. Many long-term customers generally praised that the fair provided more varieties of export commodities and better quality than in the past. Many foreign friends pointed out that this fair demonstrated China's achievements in self-reliant construction and the growing friendship between China and the people of all countries. Bonga Emangville, a commissioner from the Commercial Department Office of Congo (Brazzaville) who was invited to participate in the fair, and Wo Gao Viator, a representative of the National Trade Bureau, said that the rich and colorful commodities at the fair show that China has made great achievements in all aspects, and these achievements are a major victory for the liberation cause of the people of all countries. Wo Gao Viator said: "From the fair, it can be seen that China has friends from all directions, and the Western saying that China is isolated is a false propaganda. China is a loyal friend of the people of Congo (Brazzaville)." Several Yemeni businessmen who came to China to participate in the fair for the first time enthusiastically praised the growing friendship and economic and technical cooperation between China and Yemen when talking about their impressions. Yemeni merchant Zuberi said that trade with China "is the most sincere trade in the world." Another Yemeni merchant, Muhasan, said: "The Yemeni people love the Chinese people, and the Chinese people and their government will never be isolated." Syrian merchant Hanji said that this fair has undergone great changes compared to when he first participated in the fair in 1959. The number of guests participating in the fair has increased a lot since then, which shows that China has established very extensive trade relations with all parts of the world. A Canadian businessman who has participated in more than a dozen fairs said when talking about the grand occasion of this fair: "Everything in China is moving forward, and this is a great success achieved by the Chinese people in building the country through self-reliance."
    At this fair, China's traditional agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, animal products, handicrafts, etc., were still popular commodities; the transaction volume of hardware and minerals, light industry, textiles, chemicals, machinery, instruments, and other commodities increased significantly compared with the same period last year. The electric universal sewing machine, new alarm clock, and man-made synthetic fiber textiles, which were provided for export for the first time, aroused great interest among merchants and resulted in a large number of transactions.
    During the fair, visiting merchants also visited factories, schools, and rural people's communes, toured scenic spots, and enjoyed Chinese songs and dances, dramas, acrobatics, and movies. The development of China's socialist construction, the revolutionary spirit of the people, and the sincere, enthusiastic, and helpful social customs of not picking up lost things left a good impression on them.
    On the afternoon of the 15th, the fair held a grand closing reception at the Yangcheng Hotel. More than 2,600 foreign merchants, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, overseas Chinese, and representatives of various trading groups of the fair attended the reception. Zeng Sheng, acting chairman of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair and Mayor of Guangzhou, delivered a speech at the reception, congratulating the success of this fair. Yang Haolu, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, attended the reception.

    一九六六年春季中国出口商品交易会闭幕
    许多外国朋友指出，这次交易会表明了中国自力更生从事建设所取得的成就，以及中国同各国人民之间的友谊日益发展
    新华社广州十七日电　一九六六年春季中国出口商品交易会十五日在这里闭幕。
    这次交易会是一九五七年春季举办中国出口商品交易会以来，前来参加的外国客商人数最多、客商的地区最广和新客户最多的一次。亚非国家和地区的客人比往届交易会有显著增加。缅甸、柬埔寨、锡兰、苏丹、刚果（布）、坦桑尼亚派出了政府贸易代表团、政府官员或国营公司的代表参加这次交易会。麦什哈特阿曼、亚丁、塞拉勒窝内等亚非地区的商人，第一次前来参加中国出口商品交易会。
    我国国民经济的全面高涨，使全国各地为这次交易会提供了充分的出口物资。许多老客户普遍赞扬这次交易会提供出口的商品品种比过去更多，质量更好。许多外国朋友指出，这次交易会表明了中国自力更生从事建设所取得的成就，以及中国同各国人民之间的友谊正日益发展。应邀参加交易会的刚果（布）商业部办公室专员邦加·埃芒维尔和国家贸易局代表沃高·维阿托尔谈到，交易会上丰富多彩的商品说明中国在各方面都取得了很大成就，这些成就是各国人民解放事业的一个重大胜利。沃高·维阿托尔说：“从交易会看出，中国有来自四面八方的朋友，西方说中国孤立是一个错误的宣传。中国是刚果（布）人民的忠实朋友。”几个第一次来中国参加交易会的也门商人在谈到他们的观感时，热情赞扬中国和也门之间日益发展的友谊和经济技术合作关系。也门商人祖贝里说，跟中国进行的贸易“是世界上最真诚的贸易。”另一个也门商人穆哈桑说：“也门人民热爱中国人民，中国人民和他们的政府永远不会被孤立。”叙利亚商人汉吉说，这次交易会比他一九五九年第一次参加交易会时有了很大变化，参加交易会的客人比那时增加很多，这说明中国已经同世界各地建立了十分广泛的贸易联系。一个曾经参加过十多次交易会的加拿大商人在谈到这次交易会的盛况时说：“中国的一切都在向前发展，这是中国人民自力更生建设国家取得的巨大成功。”
    在这次交易会上，我国传统的农副产品和土特产品、畜产品、手工艺品等，仍然是受到热烈欢迎的商品；五金矿产、轻工、纺织、化工、机械、仪器等商品的成交额，较去年同期有很大增长。第一次提供出口的电动万能缝纫机、新型闹钟、人造合成纤维纺织物等，引起了客商们的极大兴趣，并达成了大量交易。
    在交易会期间，到会客商还参观了工厂、学校和农村人民公社，游览了名胜风景，欣赏了中国的歌舞、戏剧、杂技、电影。中国社会主义建设事业的发展、人民群众的革命精神和诚恳热情、乐于助人、路不拾遗的社会风尚，给他们留下了良好的印象。
    十五日下午，交易会在羊城宾馆举行盛大的闭幕酒会。参加酒会的外国商人、港澳同胞、海外华侨以及交易会各交易团的代表达二千六百多人。中国出口商品交易会代主任委员、广州市市长曾生在酒会上致词，祝贺这次交易会的成功。对外贸易部副部长杨浩庐出席了酒会。
