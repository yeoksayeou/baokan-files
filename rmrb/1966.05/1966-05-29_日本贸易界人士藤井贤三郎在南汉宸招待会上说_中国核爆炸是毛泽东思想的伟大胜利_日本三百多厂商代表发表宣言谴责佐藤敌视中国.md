    Xinhua News Agency, May 28th – Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, held a reception this evening to welcome more than 200 Japanese friendly trade figures who visited Beijing after participating in the Guangzhou Chinese Export Commodities Fair.

    Liao Chengzhi, President of the China-Japan Friendship Association, attended the reception and gave a toast. Nan Hanchen spoke at the reception.

    Kenzaburo Fujii spoke on behalf of Japanese friendly trading companies and friendly enterprises at the reception. He congratulated China on the successful completion of its third nuclear test. He said that this is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. This shows that the Chinese people possess infinitely great strength in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    He said that the Guangzhou Fair achieved great success. This is the result of the struggle waged by the people of China and Japan for Sino-Japanese friendship and expanded trade, and it is also a heavy blow to the reactionary forces attempting to obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship.

    Koichi Saionji, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing, also gave a toast at the reception.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 28th – Representatives of more than 360 Japanese manufacturers issued a declaration on the 26th, condemning the Sato government for following U.S. imperialism in its hostility towards China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The declaration was adopted at the 13th regular general meeting of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association held on that day.

    The declaration pointed out that the United States is verbally chanting about "peaceful negotiations," but is actually plotting to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the People's Republic of China and the whole of Asia.

    The declaration said that the Sato government is helping the United States carry out its war of aggression, providing Okinawa and even the Japanese mainland to the United States as bases for aggression.

    The declaration condemned the Sato government for blatantly obstructing the development of trade relations between Japan and China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    The declaration also pointed out: The purpose of the "pro-Soviet approach" policy pursued by the Sato government is to contain China, and not, as it claims, to promote Japanese-Soviet friendship and Asian peace.

    The declaration pointed out that in order to expand trade between Japan, China, Vietnam, and Korea, as well as trade with other countries, it is first necessary to oppose the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and the Sato Cabinet's policy of helping the U.S. carry out its aggression.

    The regular general meeting of the International Trade Promotion Association re-elected Tanzan Ishibashi and Tsunejiro Hiratsuka as the association's president and vice-president, respectively, and also elected the association's directors.

    新华社二十八日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸今晚举行招待会，欢迎参加广州中国出口商品交易会后来北京访问的二百多位日本友好贸易界人士。
    中日友协会长廖承志出席了招待会，并且致词祝酒。南汉宸在招待会上讲了话。
    藤井贤三郎代表日本友好商社和友好企业在招待会上讲话。他祝贺中国成功地进行了第三次核试验。他说，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这表明中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的事业上具有无限巨大的力量。
    他说，这次广州交易会获得了很大的成就。这是日中两国人民争取日中友好和扩大贸易而进行斗争的结果，也是对企图阻挠日中友好的反动势力的一个沉重的打击。
    在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一也在招待会上致词祝酒。
    新华社东京二十八日电　日本三百六十多家厂商的代表，二十六日发表宣言，谴责佐藤政府追随美帝国主义敌视中国、越南民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    这个宣言是在这天举行的日本国际贸易促进协会第十三次定期全体大会上通过的。
    宣言指出，美国在口头上高唱要“和平谈判”，实际上是阴谋把侵越战争扩大到中华人民共和国和整个亚洲。
    宣言说，佐藤政府正在帮助美国进行侵略战争，把冲绳以至日本本土都提供给美国作为侵略基地。
    宣言谴责佐藤政府露骨地阻碍日本同中国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发展贸易关系。
    宣言还指出：佐藤政府执行的“对苏接近”政策的目的在于遏制中国，并不是象它所说的是为了日苏友好和亚洲和平。
    宣言指出，为了扩大以日中、日越、日朝贸易以及和其他国家之间的贸易，首先要反对美国侵略越南，反对佐藤内阁帮助美国进行侵略的政策。
    国际贸易促进协会的这届定期全体大会再次推选石桥湛山、平塚常次郎分别担任协会的正副总裁，还选出了协会的理事。
