    "The African people want to oppose imperialism, want revolution, want complete liberation. This is the main trend of the current development of the African situation." Vice Premier Chen Yi, in a speech a few days ago, made this very correct summary of the African situation.
    On the African continent, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, aggression and anti-aggression, is being waged fiercely. Imperialism and old and new colonialism, headed by the United States, in order to restore their lost colonial positions and maintain those they are losing, have recently stepped up their counterattacks, attempting to make a comeback and reimpose the shackles of colonial enslavement on the African people.
    On the surface, the counterattack of imperialism and colonialism seems to have stirred up a black wind, rampant for a time. However, in reality, this counterattack can only illustrate their increasing weakness and death throes, and can only serve to awaken and mobilize the African people to further strengthen their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The African people are more clearly aware that those imperialist and colonialist masters who claim to be friends of Africa are actually like hungry wolves, ready to pounce and strangle their independence and freedom at any time. Only by maintaining a high degree of vigilance against them and waging a resolute struggle can Africa's independence be defended and Africa's complete liberation be achieved. It is this understanding that is stirring up a new wave of anti-imperialist and anti-colonial anger among the African people to respond to the conspiracies of imperialism and old and new colonialism. From Angola to "Portuguese" Guinea, from Zimbabwe to Equatorial Guinea, the African people are raising the banner of armed struggle even higher; from Guinea in West Africa to Tanzania in East Africa, the African people are further mobilized to fight resolutely to defend their independence. The devil rises one foot, the righteous rises ten feet. The countercurrents stirred up by imperialism and colonialism can never stop the main trend of the African people wanting to oppose imperialism, wanting revolution, and wanting complete liberation!

    “非洲人民要反帝，要革命，要彻底解放。这是非洲当前形势发展的主流。”陈毅副总理在前几天的一次讲话中，对非洲形势作了这一十分正确的概括。
    在非洲大陆上，革命和反革命、侵略和反侵略的斗争正在激烈进行着。以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义为了恢复它们已经失去和保持正在失去的殖民阵地，最近加紧进行反扑，力图卷土重来，把殖民奴役的枷锁重新强加在非洲人民的头上。
    从表面上看来，帝国主义和殖民主义者的反扑似乎刮起了一股黑风，猖狂一时。但是，实际上，这种反扑只能说明它们的日益虚弱和垂死挣扎，只能起唤醒和动员非洲人民进一步加强反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的作用。非洲人民更加清楚地认识到，那些自命为非洲朋友的帝国主义殖民主义老爷们，原来都象饿狼一样地随时准备扑过来扼杀他们的独立自由。只有对它们保持高度的警惕，进行坚决的斗争，才能保卫非洲的独立，争取非洲的彻底解放。正是这种认识，正在使非洲人民掀起反帝反殖的新的怒潮，来回答帝国主义和新老殖民主义的阴谋。从安哥拉到“葡属”几内亚，从津巴布韦到赤道几内亚，非洲人民更高地举起武装斗争的义旗；从西非的几内亚到东非的坦桑尼亚，非洲人民进一步动员起来为保卫独立而坚决斗争。魔高一尺，道高一丈。帝国主义和殖民主义者掀起的逆流，决不可能阻挡非洲人民要反帝、要革命、要彻底解放的主流！
