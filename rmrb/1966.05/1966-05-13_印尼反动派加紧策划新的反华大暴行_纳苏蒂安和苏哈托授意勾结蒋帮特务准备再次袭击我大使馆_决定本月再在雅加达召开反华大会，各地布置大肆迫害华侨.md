　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 12th dispatch: According to reliable sources, the Indonesian right-wing military regime is actively plotting and organizing right-wing thugs and Chiang gang secret agents to create new and more serious bloody atrocities involving armed attacks on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia in the next few days. They plan to hold an anti-China rally in Banteng Square on the scheduled date. After the meeting, thugs and Chiang gang secret agents, in coordination with Indonesian armed personnel, will once again launch an armed attack on the Chinese Embassy, set fire to the embassy, and kill the embassy's diplomatic personnel.
　　This extremely serious conspiracy was formulated under the instructions of Nasution and Suharto, the heads of the Indonesian right-wing general group. Yang Weibin, one of the criminals who participated in the April 15 attack on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, a Chiang gang secret agent and a secret agent of the Indonesian Army authorities, came forward to preside over a meeting at the Meijiang Hotel in Jakarta on April 29. The resolution passed at the meeting coerced all overseas Chinese to be loyal to Suharto and to support all the measures taken by Suharto. After the meeting, this group of Chiang gang secret agents openly declared that they had received "full support" from the highest authorities of the Indonesian right-wing military and decided to convene another "oath of allegiance conference" in Jakarta in May to further incite large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities. They also prepared to join Indonesian right-wing thugs in attacking the Chinese Embassy again and looting and destroying the shops and residences of patriotic overseas Chinese.
　　The Indonesian official Antara News Agency publicly reported on the meeting of this group of Chiang gang secret agents on May 7 and announced that the so-called "Jakarta Overseas Chinese Supporting Indonesian Government Action Conference" would be held in Jakarta. Signs indicate that the activities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces colluding with Chiang gang elements to create new anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities are gradually spreading to other parts of Indonesia.
　　Recently, right-wing military and political authorities in various parts of Indonesia have used Chiang gang secret agents to provide them with information on overseas Chinese communities and schools, to devise plans for persecuting overseas Chinese, and to serve as thugs to attack and destroy Chinese embassies and consulates and persecute overseas Chinese communities and schools. Right-wing military authorities in various places instructed Chiang gang secret agents to come forward to threaten patriotic overseas Chinese not to hold positions in overseas Chinese organizations and forced patriotic overseas Chinese organizations to "dissolve voluntarily" so that they could seize the leadership of overseas Chinese organizations. Right-wing military authorities in various places also instructed Chiang gang secret agents to establish pseudo-organizations such as the "Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce" and the "Chinese Charity Association" as tools for implementing the will of the Indonesian right-wing military regime and promoting anti-China activities.

    印尼反动派加紧策划新的反华大暴行
    纳苏蒂安和苏哈托授意勾结蒋帮特务准备再次袭击我大使馆
    决定本月再在雅加达召开反华大会，各地布置大肆迫害华侨
    新华社十二日讯　雅加达消息：据可靠消息，印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在积极策划和组织右派暴徒及蒋帮特务分子，在最近几天内制造新的更严重的武装袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的血腥暴行。他们计划在预定的日期先在雄牛广场举行反华集会，会后，暴徒和蒋帮特务分子在印度尼西亚武装人员的配合下，再次武装袭击中国大使馆，纵火烧毁大使馆，杀害大使馆的外交人员。
    这一极其严重的阴谋计划，是由印度尼西亚右派将领集团头目纳苏蒂安和苏哈托授意制定的。参加四月十五日袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的凶犯之一、蒋帮特务分子和印度尼西亚陆军当局密探杨伟彬，四月二十九日在雅加达梅江饭店出面主持一次会议。会议通过的决议胁迫全体华侨效忠苏哈托，并且支持苏哈托所采取的一切措施。这批蒋帮特务分子在会后公开扬言，他们已经得到印度尼西亚右派军人最高当局的“充分支持”，并且决定在五月间在雅加达再次召集“宣誓效忠大会”，进一步煽起大规模的反华、排华暴行。他们还准备同印度尼西亚右派暴徒一起，再一次袭击中国大使馆，并且大肆抢劫和破坏爱国华侨的商店和住宅。
    印度尼西亚官方的安塔拉通讯社五月七日公开报道了这次蒋帮特务分子的集会，并且预告将在雅加达举行所谓“雅加达华侨支持印度尼西亚政府行动大会”。迹象表明，印度尼西亚右派反动势力勾结蒋帮分子，制造新的反华、排华暴行的活动，正在逐渐扩展到印度尼西亚全国其它地方。
    最近，印度尼西亚各地右派军政当局利用蒋帮特务分子，要他们提供有关华侨社团、学校的情况的材料，要他们为迫害华侨出谋划策，充当袭击破坏中国使领馆和迫害华侨社团、学校的打手。各地右派军事当局指使蒋帮特务分子出面威胁爱国华侨不得再在华侨团体中任职，强迫爱国华侨团体“自动解散”，以便由他们窃取华侨团体的领导权。各地右派军事当局还授意蒋帮特务分子设立“华侨工商协会”、“中华慈善会”等伪组织，作为贯彻印度尼西亚右派军人政权意旨和推行反华活动的工具。
