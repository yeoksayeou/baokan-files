    Who is "Beijing Literature" Serving?
    Zheng Gongdun
    In the past few months, a great debate has unfolded on our country's cultural and academic front, starting with the criticism of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and currently revealing the criticism of the "Three-Family Village" black den headed by Deng Tuo. This is a struggle between two classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; a struggle between two roads, socialism and capitalism; and a struggle between two ideologies, Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and anti-Marxism-Leninism-anti-Mao Zedong Thought. This struggle is a major event concerning the future of the revolution and the destiny of the country. In this great struggle, many newspapers and periodicals across the country are unprecedentedly active and full of vigor, publishing critical articles with high revolutionary enthusiasm to disinfect and weed out the poisonous weeds. This is a great and heartening event.
    However, newspapers and periodicals such as "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily," which have now been exposed, have used two-faced methods of ostensibly complying while actually opposing, in every possible way resisting the development of this struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie in the ideological field.
    It is worth noting that when the people of the whole country are unanimously denouncing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the "Three-Family Village" black gang members Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and others, "Beijing Literature," which has always actively served the "Three-Family Village" black gang, remains silent.
    What exactly is going on?
    As everyone knows, Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," which unfairly spoke up for right-leaning opportunists who were "dismissed from office" and encouraged them to "try again after failing," was "born" from "Beijing Literature."
    Back then, how lively it was when this big poisonous weed came out! The editors of "Beijing Literature" added an eye-catching bold title and exceptionally printed the author's preface of the script in old No. 5 font, a font that was only used for individual important documents in this publication at that time. This shows how actively the editors of "Beijing Literature" served this reactionary new historical drama.
    Then, this publication threw out Deng Yunian's, that is, Deng Shaoji's, "Review of 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" and Qu Liuyi's "Ashamed to Be a Licorice, Daring to Be Southern Bao Gong," two articles that狂热ly praised and supported this reactionary historical drama. They said that Wu Han was "a historian who is good at combining historical research with participating in the actual struggle," and that now "he has opened up a new path for himself to better serve socialist reality and the people with his historical research," and that Wu Han "wrote the truth of history from a historical point of view"! They said that Hai Rui "objectively did many good things for the people and caused some 'embarrassment' to the ruling class"! They greatly appreciated Wu Han's skill in "using the past to satirize the present," and especially pointed out that the ending of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in the play, where he was "dismissed from office," was "deeply meaningful" and that the audience should "savor and chew" after watching the play①.
    All of this echoed the articles published in "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News" that "addressed each other as brothers" and cheered "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" for "breaking out," forming a chorus of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment.
    The position of "Beijing Literature" in the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the Party and socialism is clear to the readers. This publication has been occupied by the bourgeoisie and has become their position for spreading poison!
    The broad masses of readers have firmly remembered this debt!
    Now, after the proletariat has launched a massive counterattack, what has "Beijing Literature" done? Have they criticized Wu Han, the "vanguard" of the "Three-Family Village"? Have they seriously criticized their own ugly behavior of supporting these black gang members in opposing the Party and socialism?
    If we say that they haven't done anything, it would be a bit "unfair." They are indeed very "active"! But they are actively covering up for Wu Han and actively resisting revolutionary criticism!
    If you don't believe it, please look at the following facts.
    In the December issue of "Beijing Literature" last year, Yao Wenyuan's "Review of the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" was reprinted. However, the editors added a very "clever" "editor's note" when reprinting this article. Two points in this note are particularly noteworthy: First, the "editor's note" said: "We believe that the questions raised by Comrade Yao Wenyuan are very important. Since there are different opinions about this script and its comments, they should be discussed in depth." Look, the editors are pretending to be so objective, fair, and neutral, but it is a completely hypocritical face! They fundamentally avoid the question of whether "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a poisonous weed, and in fact, they disagree with the conclusion in Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article. Second, what issues do they want to discuss? The "editor's note" says: "We hope to launch a discussion on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' and related literary and artistic issues" (emphasis added by us). Here, the true intentions of the editors are fully exposed. It turns out that they want to set a tone for the "discussion" that only talks about literature and art and does not talk about politics!
    Here, let's take another look at the "editor's note" added by "Beijing Daily" when it reprinted Yao Wenyuan's "Review of the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" on November 29 last year. The original text reads:
      "...'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,' compiled by Comrade Wu Han, is a play with a relatively large impact. ... In recent years, the academic and literary circles have had different opinions on the play 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' and other articles written by Comrade Wu Han. We believe that different opinions should be discussed. ... In order to facilitate everyone to use historical materialism and the viewpoint of class analysis to clarify the rights and wrongs and solve problems in a realistic manner, we are prepared to discuss 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' and other related issues in this newspaper."
    Everyone, look, how "similar" is the language of the "editor's note" added by "Beijing Literature" when reprinting Yao Wenyuan's article to the "editor's note" added by "Beijing Daily" when reprinting this article! This is: only talk about academics, not politics; only have a general discussion, not a thorough criticism and exposure of anti-Party elements.
    Are they coincidental? Why do they speak with one voice?
    In fact, they are all acting according to the "instructions" of the "Three-Family Village" black den Deng Tuos. At the symposium on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" convened by Deng Tuo, it was repeatedly emphasized that this great debate was an "academic issue and must be handled in accordance with the principle of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend'," that people should "liberate their minds and not worry about writing articles, and not be afraid of having something in common with Wu Han," that "we should avoid lengthy and repetitive articles," and that we should "not put big hats on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office', but use a tone of consultation and exploration"②. and so on.
    Isn't the matter very clear? "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Literature" are precisely carrying out the "principles and spirit" "instructed" by the owner of this "Three-Family Village" black den to conduct the "discussion" of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    This shows that not only "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" have become tools for the "Three-Family Village" to oppose the Party and socialism, but even "Beijing Literature," the only literary publication in Beijing, has in essence become a tool of the anti-Party group of "Three-Family Village" black gang members Deng Tuo and his ilk!
      "Trying to hide something only makes it more obvious"! "Beijing Literature" attempts to use discussions on literary and artistic issues to deceive and mislead readers, thinking that as long as they hang up the signboard of "discussion," readers will not blame them and will think that they have also participated in the ranks of the cultural revolution. However, these ulterior motives, especially their "editor's notes" that attempt to deceive readers, fully expose their true colors as an anti-Party and anti-socialist tool of the "Three-Family Village."
    Because, everyone can see clearly that the "Beijing Literature" "editor's note" points out that the trick of only talking about literature and art and not politics when discussing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is completely in line with the needs of the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" black gang members.
    We want to ask the editors of "Beijing Literature": The main problem of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is precisely in the political aspect, and the articles you published praising it are precisely focused on the political aspect of "using the past to satirize the present." At that time, what you wanted people to "savor and chew" was precisely the ending of "dismissal from office." Now that you want to "discuss" it, why do you set such a framework from the beginning that only talks about "related literary and artistic issues"?
    To put it bluntly, this is just a method of covering up for Wu Han, the "vanguard" of the "Three-Family Village," according to the criminal conspiracy of the owner of the "Three-Family Village" black den: avoiding political issues and leading the discussion astray!
    The reason why "Beijing Literature" so obediently listens to the "will" of the "Three-Family Village," especially their black den owner Deng Tuo, to play this trick is not only to let Wu Han get away with it, but also to think that they can deceive people and slip away in this major struggle of right and wrong!
    In the past few months, "Beijing Literature" has indeed used their "editor's note" as the "guideline" to arrange the "discussion."
    Since the publication of this "editor's note," half a year has passed! Now, the criticism of the reactionary historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has become increasingly in-depth, and the exposure of Wu Han's criminal activities of using writing history and literature and art to oppose the Party and socialism has become increasingly clear. Even the "Three-Family Village" black den opened by Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han together has been exposed to the public. "Beijing Literature" probably feels that there is nothing "relevant to literary and artistic issues" here, so during this period, except for publishing a few so-called "discussion" articles in the January issue of this year, there has been no movement until today!
    What is particularly noteworthy is that the only four "discussion" articles in the January issue of "Beijing Literature," whether they are three general "critical" short articles or a long article supporting Wu Han, are precisely in line with the above-mentioned "basic spirit" of the "editor's note." That is: fundamentally avoiding the anti-Party and anti-socialist political issues of the "Three-Family Village" black gang member Wu Han, and blindly making a fuss about the issue of "incorruptible officials" and the evaluation of historical figures. In particular, that negative article signed by Zhiyi, viciously counterattacked Comrade Yao Wenyuan, desperately cheered for the "perfect" and "tall" image of Hai Rui, and狂热ly praised Wu Han for pouring "rich" and "abundant" "emotions" into this "incorruptible official." They said that Wu Han's writing of the character Hai Rui was completely "reasonable" and "unobjectionable," "in line with historical truth," and purposefully hinted that Wu Han "wanted the image itself to speak and show a certain tendency." When many comrades unanimously pointed out that the "Hai Rui" written by Wu Han in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was essentially the incarnation of right-leaning opportunists, a fake Hai Rui, the author of that article insisted that "Hai Rui is 'this one' Hai Rui."
    It is not difficult for people to see how the editors of "Beijing Literature" organize "discussions" according to their own reactionary intentions and tastes. The editors painstakingly selected these articles for publication, calling it "discussion," but in essence, they were trying to excuse and cover up for Wu Han, a member of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. And this negative article was actually written entirely in accordance with the intention of the "Beijing Literature" editor's note.
    It is also not difficult for people to see that what "Beijing Literature" has done is to sing a contrary tune in this debate, to confront this great criticism, and to rack their brains to oppose this cultural revolution!
    "Beijing Literature" is so active and so interested in releasing poisonous weeds, but so passive and so resistant to removing poisonous weeds! Comparing these two situations and two attitudes, isn't it very clear who is in control of this publication, who it has become a tool for, and who it is serving?
    It should be pointed out that the large and small poisonous weeds released by "Beijing Literature" in recent years are by no means limited to the reactionary historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." In the past few years, it also published Huang Qiuyun's "Du Zimei Returns Home"③. This kind of vicious big poisonous weed that uses the past to satirize the present, uses the story of the poet Du Fu, with ulterior motives, to insinuate reality and viciously oppose the Party and the socialist system. It wrote Du Fu's journey home as "people living in misery and wailing everywhere." The author insidiously used the mouth of an old man to say to Du Fu: "You officials who receive salaries must think of a way for us people! ... You must remember the suffering of us people!" They said, "In recent years... the bureaucracy has become corrupt... the emperor lives deep in the palace, blocking his wisdom and cutting off the channels of speech. The suffering of the people is deepening day by day, and productivity is declining day by day. He is kept in the dark and knows nothing, and finally the 'An Lushan Rebellion' broke out..." This poisonous weed, published in the name of "commemorating Du Fu" and using the past to satirize the present, was also arranged in the prominent position of the first article in "Beijing Literature" and published. It was only after other newspapers and periodicals launched criticisms that it was forced to publish a critical article. This publication also wantonly distorted the Party's policy of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and vigorously praised another big poisonous weed, "Li Huiniang," regarding this ghost play as a "finishing touch." Especially in an article written in the name of "reporter of this journal," it was believed that Meng Chao's adaptation of this play "changed from writing about love between children to writing about the affairs of the world," "grasping the main line of political struggle very well," and "the adaptation is creative." "Beijing Literature" also published articles to vigorously defend ghost plays. They said that although there are ghosts in the play, it does not mean that it promotes superstition. They even believed that this kind of article could also be regarded as an aspect of commemorating the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." It was not until later that various newspapers and periodicals widely launched criticisms of ghost plays, especially the big poisonous weed "Li Huiniang," and this ghost play was so stinky that "Beijing Literature" was forced to reprint Fan Xing's (i.e., Liao Mosha's) hypocritical and insincere "self-criticism." And in the "editor's note," it emptily admitted that publishing these poisonous weeds was a "serious mistake"④. In addition, no serious inspection was made, and the method of "inviting readers to read" this "self-criticism" was used, without mentioning a word about letting readers participate in the criticism, to shut the readers' mouths.
    That is to say, in the eyes of the editors of "Beijing Literature," only anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are allowed to release poison in the publications they control, turning the publications into a position for the bourgeoisie to oppose the Party and socialism, and狂热ly attack the Party and the people; only those who release poison are allowed to continue to deceive people with hypocritical "self-criticism," and readers are not allowed to settle accounts with them, and readers are not allowed to launch a counterattack against the reactionary bourgeois ideology and carry out the struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. Isn't that the case?
    Now, their attitude towards the struggle against the "Three-Family Village" black gang members has gone a step further, playing tricks, pretending to "discuss," sincerely shielding, ostensibly complying while actually opposing, and resisting criticism!
    Literature and art are weapons of class struggle. The proletariat wants to use literature and art as weapons, and the bourgeoisie does not relax its grip on literature and art as weapons. The ideological struggle on the literary and art front has always been very fierce. The "Three-Family Village" black gang's claws have stretched into "Beijing Literature" and other literary and art publications, using the literary and art positions to stir up trouble, using the bourgeois literary and art line to replace the proletarian socialist literary and art line, and using the bourgeois worldview and artistic taste to corrupt the literary and art ranks and destroy the socialist literary and art cause. This once again shows that we must attach great importance to the class struggle in the literary and art field and must not be negligent. In 1964, Comrade Mao Zedong sharply and seriously criticized the leaders of some important cultural departments and some literary and art publications for basically not implementing the Party's policies. These publications rejected the Party's leadership, did not implement the revolutionary task of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, but actively promoted feudalism and capitalism, and opposed Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; they did not act as tools of the proletariat to fight against bourgeois ideology, but used this position to launch an attack on the proletariat; they abandoned the revolutionary banner of criticism, but raised the black banner of anti-Party and anti-socialism. Even today, two years after Comrade Mao Zedong made his criticism, the class struggle in the ideological field has deepened step by step, and the socialist cultural revolution has vigorously unfolded, but these publications are turning a deaf ear, being passively怠工, and even stubbornly resisting. This is absolutely intolerable!
    We must directly attack the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" black den, and we must smash all their branches, pull out the black flags, seize back the positions, and plant the proletarian revolutionary red banner of criticism on the positions of all newspapers and periodicals! No matter whether they are the Three-Family Village or the Four-Family Village, no matter whether they are "famous scholars" or "experts and miscellaneous scholars," no matter how "strong" their strength is, "thorough materialists have nothing to fear"! We must thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line on the cultural front, and we will never stop fighting until we win a complete victory! We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end!
    What will become of "Beijing Literature"? The broad masses of readers are waiting to see!

### 《北京文艺》在为谁服务？

    《北京文艺》在为谁服务？
    郑公盾
    这几个月来，我国文化学术战线上从批判吴晗反党反社会主义的《海瑞罢官》开始，到目前揭开以邓拓为首的“三家村”黑店的批判，展开了一场大论战。这是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想两种思想的斗争。这场斗争，是关系到革命前途和国家命运的大事。在这场大斗争中，全国许多报刊空前活跃，生气勃勃，以高度的革命热情发表批判文章，来消毒除草。这是一件值得人们欢欣鼓舞的大好事。
    但是，现在已经揭露出来的《前线》《北京日报》等报刊，在这场意识形态领域兴无灭资的斗争中，却以阳奉阴违的两面手法，百般抗拒着这个斗争的开展。
    值得我们注意的是，当全国人民群众正在同声斥责“三家村”黑店邓拓、吴晗等人反党反社会主义罪行的时候，象《前线》《北京日报》那样，一向积极地为“三家村”黑帮分子效命服务的《北京文艺》，却也不吭一声。
    这到底是怎么一回事呢？
    大家知道，吴晗为右倾机会主义分子被“罢官”鸣不平，鼓励他们“失败了再干”的反党反社会主义大毒草《海瑞罢官》，就是在《北京文艺》“破门而出”的。
    想当年，这棵大毒草出笼之时何等热闹！《北京文艺》的编者给它加了醒目的黑体标题，还对剧本的作者前言破例地用老五号字排印，这种字在当时这个刊物上只是给个别重要文件用的。由此可以看出《北京文艺》的编者是何等积极地为这出反动的新编历史剧效劳了。
    接着，这个刊物又抛出了邓允建即邓绍基的《评〈海瑞罢官〉》和曲六乙的《羞为甘草剂　敢做南包公》两篇文章，对这出反动历史剧作了狂热的吹捧和支持。说什么吴晗是“一位善于将历史研究和参加现实斗争结合起来的史学家”，现在“他又为他开辟了一条将自己的历史研究更好地为社会主义现实，为人民服务的新途径”，和吴晗“从历史主义出发，写出了历史的真实”呀！说什么海瑞“在客观上为人民做了很多好事，给统治阶级造成一些‘难堪’”呀！他们十分赞赏吴晗善于“借古讽今”，并且特别点明了《海瑞罢官》一剧中的
  “罢了官”的结尾，是“深寓着丰富的意味的”，要观众“看完戏之后”去“回味和咀嚼”，等等①。
    这一切，跟当时《北京日报》《北京晚报》上发表的那些“称兄道弟”欢呼《海瑞罢官》“破门而出”的文章，相互呼应，汇成了反党反社会主义的合奏曲。
    《北京文艺》在资产阶级对党对社会主义的猖狂进攻中，处于一种什么样的地位，读者是一目了然的。这个刊物已经为资产阶级所占领，成为他们放毒的阵地了！
    广大读者心中牢牢地记住了这一笔账！
    现在，当无产阶级发动了声势浩大的反攻之后，《北京文艺》又做了些什么呢？他们批判“三家村”的“先锋”吴晗了吗？他们认真批判自己支持这些黑帮分子反党反社会主义的丑恶行为了吗？
    如果说他们什么都没有做过，也有点“冤枉”。他们的确也很“积极”！不过他们是在积极地给吴晗打掩护，积极地对革命的批判进行抵制！
    不信，请看下面的事实。
    去年十二月号的《北京文艺》上，转载了姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》。但是编者在转载这篇文章的时候，却加了一个很“巧妙”的“编者按语”。这个按语有两点特别值得注意：其一，“编者按”说：“我们认为，姚文元同志提出的问题很重要，对于这个剧本及其评论，既然有不同意见，应当深入地进行讨论”。你看，编者装出一副多么客观、公正、中立，然而却是彻头彻尾的虚伪面孔！他们根本回避《海瑞罢官》是不是毒草的问题，实际上是不同意姚文元同志文章中的结论。其二，他们要讨论些什么问题呢？“编者按”说：“我们希望就《海瑞罢官》及其有关文艺方面的问题展开讨论”（重点号我们加的）。在这里，编者的真实意图完全暴露出来了。原来他们要给“讨论”定一个只谈文艺，不谈政治的调子！
    这里让我们再看看去年十一月二十九日《北京日报》转载姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文时所加的“编者按”吧。原文这样写道：
      “……吴晗同志编的《海瑞罢官》是一出影响较大的戏。……几年来，学术界、文艺界对《海瑞罢官》这出戏和吴晗同志写的其它文章是有不同意见的。我们认为，有不同的意见应该展开讨论。……为了便于大家运用历史唯物主义和阶级分析的观点实事求是地弄清楚是非，解决问题，我们准备在本报就《海瑞罢官》及其它有关的问题讨论。”
    大家看，《北京文艺》转载姚文元同志这篇文章时加的“编者按”，与《北京日报》转载这篇文章时加的“编者按”的语言是多么“酷肖”啊！这就是：只谈学术，不讲政治；只是一般地讨论讨论，而不是大张旗鼓地对反党分子进行彻底的批判和揭露。
    难道它们是偶合的吗？它们为什么这样一鼻孔出气呢？
    事实上，它们都是遵照“三家村”黑店邓拓们“指示”办事的。在邓拓召开的关于《海瑞罢官》的座谈会上，就曾经反复强调这次大论战是“学术问题，必须按照‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’办事”，要人们“思想要解放，写文章不要有顾虑，不要怕与吴晗有共同之处”，“要避免连篇累牍，千篇一律”，对《海瑞罢官》“不要加大帽子，要用商讨的语气，探讨的语气”②。等等。
    事情不是很清楚了吗？《北京日报》《北京文艺》正是按照这个“三家村”黑店掌柜所“指示”的“原则精神”来进行对《海瑞罢官》的“讨论”的。
    这说明，不但《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》成了“三家村”反党反社会主义的工具，连北京市这个仅有的文艺刊物——《北京文艺》，实质上也已成为有领导、有组织、有计划的“三家村”黑帮分子邓拓们反党集团的工具了！
      “欲盖弥彰”！《北京文艺》妄图以讨论有关文艺方面的问题，来蒙蔽和欺骗读者，以为只要挂了个“讨论”的招牌，读者就不会责难他们了，就会认为他们也参加到文化革命的行列里来了，但是他们的这些别有用心的行径，特别是他们的企图欺骗读者的“编者按”，充分地自我暴露了他们是“三家村”的反党反社会主义工具的真面目。
    因为，谁都看得清楚，《北京文艺》“编者按”中指出的对《海瑞罢官》进行讨论时只谈文艺、不谈政治的鬼花招，是完完全全符合“三家村”黑帮分子反党反社会主义的需要的。
    我们要问《北京文艺》的编者：《海瑞罢官》的主要问题正是在政治方面，而你们发表的吹捧文章也恰恰是着眼于“借古讽今”的政治方面，当时你们要人们“回味和咀嚼”的，正是那“罢官”的结尾；如今要“讨论”了，你们为什么一开始就给限定这样一个只谈“有关文艺方面的问题”的框框呢？
    说穿了，这不过是按照“三家村”黑店掌柜的罪恶阴谋，为“三家村”“先锋”吴晗打掩护的手法：回避政治问题，把讨论引到歧路上去！
    《北京文艺》其所以这样好乖乖地听从“三家村”，特别是他们的黑店掌柜邓拓的“旨意”，来玩弄这种手法的目的，不但是要让吴晗滑过去，而且也想自己在这场大是大非的斗争中，可以蒙混人们的耳目，滑了过去！
    这几个月以来，《北京文艺》的确是以他们的“编者按”为“纲”，来安排“讨论”的。
    从这个“编者按”发表以来，半年时间过去了！现在对反动历史剧《海瑞罢官》的批判已日益深入，对吴晗利用写历史、写文艺来进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动的揭露也越来越清楚，甚至连邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗合伙开的“三家村”这家黑店都被人揭了底，公诸于众了。《北京文艺》大概觉得在这里没有什么“有关文艺方面的问题”吧，所以在这期间，除了今年一月号登了几篇所谓“讨论”文章外，直到今天再没有什么动静！
    尤其值得人们注意的是，《北京文艺》一月号上仅有的四篇“讨论”文章，不论是三篇一般的“批判”短文，还是一篇为吴晗撑腰的长文，都是恰恰符合上述“编者按”的“基本精神”的。这就是：根本回避了“三家村”黑帮分子吴晗的反党反社会主义的政治问题，而一味在“清官”问题和历史人物评价问题上大作文章。其中特别是那一篇署名志毅的为吴晗吹捧的反面文章，恶毒地对姚文元同志进行了反扑，极力为海瑞这一形象的“完美”“高大”喝采，狂热地为吴晗倾注在这个“清官”身上“丰富”而“充沛”的“感情”叫好。说什么吴晗写海瑞这个人物完全“合情合理”“无可非议”，“符合历史真实”，并且别有用心地暗示：吴晗是“要让形象本身来说话，来显示某种倾向性”。在许多同志一致地指出吴晗在《海瑞罢官》中所写的“海瑞”实质上是右倾机会主义分子的化身，是假海瑞的时候，那篇文章的作者却坚持“海瑞就是‘这一个’海瑞”。
    人们不难看出，《北京文艺》的编者是怎样按照自己的反动意图和口味来组织“讨论”的。编者处心积虑地选了这几篇文章发表，美其名为“讨论”，实质上却是替“三家村”黑帮分子吴晗开脱，打掩护。而这篇反面文章，实际上正是完全按照《北京文艺》编者按语的意图来写的。
    人们也不难看出，《北京文艺》的所作所为，就是在这次论战中唱反调，是在对抗这次大批判，是挖空心思来反对这次文化大革命！
    《北京文艺》对放毒草是那样积极，那样兴致勃勃，而对于除毒草却是这样消极，这样百般抵制！把这两种情况、两种态度相对照，这个刊物是掌握在谁手里，成为了谁的工具，是在为谁服务，不是十分明白的么？
    应当指出，《北京文艺》这几年来放的大大小小的毒草决不止反动历史剧《海瑞罢官》。前几年，它还发表了黄秋耘的《杜子美还家》③。这样恶毒的借古讽今的大毒草，它借诗人杜甫的故事，别有用心地影射现实，恶毒地反对党和社会主义制度。它把杜甫回家的一路情景，写成“民不聊生、哀鸿遍野。”，作者含沙射影地借一个老头之口对杜甫说：“你当官受禄的，可真要给我们老百姓想办法啊！……可真要叨念我们老百姓的痛苦啊！”说什么“这些年来……吏治腐化，……皇帝深居宫中，蔽塞聪明，杜绝言路，人民的痛苦一天比一天加深，生产力一天比一天衰落，他老人家蒙在鼓里，一点儿也不知道，终于闹出‘安史之乱’来，……”这株名为“纪念杜甫”而发表的借古讽今指桑骂槐的毒草，也被编排在《北京文艺》第一篇的显著地位刊登出来的，只是在后来其他报刊开展批判后，才被迫无奈地发表了一篇批评文章。这个刊物还肆意歪曲党的推陈出新方针，极力吹捧另一棵大毒草《李慧娘》，把这出鬼戏看作是“锦上添花”之作。特别是在以“本刊记者”名义写的文章中，认为孟超改编的这出戏“从写儿女情改变为写天下事”，“抓住政治斗争这条主线很好”，“改编本是有创造性的”。《北京文艺》还发表文章，极力为鬼戏辩护。说什么戏里虽然有鬼，但是，并不等于宣扬迷信。他们甚至认为这种文章也算纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的一个方面。直到后来，各报刊广泛地展开了对鬼戏、特别是对大毒草《李慧娘》的批判，这出鬼戏实在太臭了，才迫使《北京文艺》转载了繁星（即廖沫沙）的一篇虚伪的言不由衷的“自我批评”。并在“编者按”中空洞地承认了发表这些毒草是“严重的错误”④。此外，再也没有作什么认真的检查，而且还用“请读者阅读”这篇“自我批评”，只字不提让读者参加批判的手法，来封住读者的口。
    这就是说，在《北京文艺》编者那里，只许反党反社会主义分子在他们所把持的刊物上放毒，把刊物变为资产阶级反党反社会主义的阵地，猖狂地向党和人民进攻；只许放毒者用虚伪的“自我批评”继续骗人，而不许读者跟他们算账，不许读者对反动的资产阶级思想给予反攻，进行兴无灭资的斗争。难道事实不正是这样吗？
    现在，他们对待“三家村”黑帮分子的斗争则进了一步，玩弄手段，假装“讨论”，真心包庇，阳奉阴违，抵制批判！
    文艺是阶级斗争的武器，无产阶级要利用文艺这个武器，资产阶级也不放松文艺这个武器。文艺战线上的思想斗争向来是十分激烈的。“三家村”黑帮集团的魔爪伸进了《北京文艺》和其它文艺刊物，利用文艺阵地来兴风作浪，用资产阶级文艺路线来代替无产阶级的社会主义文艺路线，用资产阶级的世界观和艺术趣味来腐蚀文艺队伍，破坏社会主义文艺事业，这又一次说明我们必须十分重视文艺领域中的阶级斗争，千万不可以麻痹大意。一九六四年，毛泽东同志就尖锐地严肃地批评过一些重要文化部门的领导，一些文艺刊物，基本上不执行党的政策。这些刊物拒绝党的领导，不执行兴无灭资的革命任务，却积极地宣传封建主义、资本主义思想，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想；它们不是作为无产阶级的工具，对资产阶级意识形态作斗争，而是利用这个阵地对无产阶级实行进攻；它们抛弃革命的批判的红旗，却树起了反党反社会主义的黑旗。而时至今日，毛泽东同志提出批评已过了两年，意识形态领域的阶级斗争已步步深入，社会主义文化大革命已经蓬勃展开，这些刊物却装聋作哑，消极怠工，甚至负隅顽抗。这是绝不能容忍的！
    我们一定要直捣反党反社会主义“三家村”黑店，并且要粉碎他们的一切分店，拔掉黑旗，夺回阵地，把无产阶级的革命的批判的红旗，插到各个报刊的阵地上去！不管他们是三家村或四家村，不管他们是什么“名流学者”、“专家杂家”，不管他们有多么“雄厚”的力量，“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”！我们一定要彻底搞掉文化战线上的反党反社会主义的黑线，不获全胜，决不收兵！我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底！
    《北京文艺》何去何从，广大读者且拭目以待！
