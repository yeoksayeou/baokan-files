    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th. Yoko Kitazawa, wife of Masao Kitazawa, the Japanese representative to the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, recently returned to Japan from Cairo. She told a reporter from the "Japan and China" newspaper that Africans believe that China has consistently supported national liberation movements and is a trustworthy country. She also said that China's aid to African countries strives to enable those countries to achieve economic independence.

    Yoko Kitazawa said, "I have lived in Africa for seven years and have realized that in the eyes of Africans, China has consistently supported liberation movements. In the eyes of fully independent countries and progressive people, China is a reliable country."

    Yoko Kitazawa said, "Since the Soviet Union adopted the policy of 'peaceful coexistence' and emphasized compromise with the United States, this has become particularly clear. It is strongly felt that the Soviet Union's 'peaceful coexistence' policy cannot actually advance the African national liberation movement."

    "Because of this, African youth have something more than just a sense of closeness to China. That is, they harbor this feeling towards China: that China is a country where one can learn about revolution."

    "Although the Soviet Union has invited many African students, the feeling is that they have learned almost nothing that would enable Africa to achieve independence and liberation. However, students returning from China, even those who have studied medicine and engineering, are useful for liberation and independence."

    Speaking about economic aid to African countries, Yoko Kitazawa said that Africans consider China to be a large country, a socialist country that provides (them) with economic assistance. She said that China's economic aid is completely different from the Soviet Union's approach. The Soviet Union's aid policy is for "reputation and fame." Therefore, after they help build universities or factories, the teachers in the universities are all Soviet people, and the engineers in the factories are also Soviet people.

    "However, China's aid seeks to enable that country's economy to become independent. China's aid is mostly for projects that locals can master with a little learning and that are urgently needed. China's foreign aid loans are interest-free or have very low interest rates. The Soviet Union's foreign aid loans have relatively high interest rates."

    Yoko Kitazawa said, "Although China's aid is not large in quantity, it gives the impression of genuine aid from a socialist country. At the same time, the Chinese try to use local languages as much as possible and strive to live the same lives as the locals. So, in my seven years of living in Africa, I have never heard of any scandals involving Chinese people."

    Yoko Kitazawa said, "There are now many Soviet people in Cairo, and their attitude is quite arrogant. They never use local languages. There have been scandals among them, such as theft, affairs, and smuggling. Therefore, Soviet people are considered Westerners by Africans."

    The Soviet Union's aid policy, which is carried out for the sake of fame, is not only not much different from American aid, but it even provides military aid to people who are about to fall and to new colonialist countries. Africans have actually seen that (this aid) is often used to suppress the struggles of the African people.

    Yoko Kitazawa said that the people of Africa evaluate a country based on its actions. The evaluation of the Chinese is that they have a noble style. This is welcomed in Africa.

    Chinese films depicting struggles with landlords, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and guerrilla warfare are welcomed by Africans.

    When China tested the atomic bomb, not only fully independent countries in Africa, but even the ruling classes of some other countries, were happy that this was the first time a country other than Western countries had conducted an atomic bomb test.

    日本人士北泽洋子谈她在非洲长期生活后的体会
    非洲人民把中国看作是靠得住的国家
    苏联的援助同美“援”无大区别常被用来镇压非洲人民斗争
    新华社东京十日电　最近从开罗回到日本的日本驻亚非人民团结组织书记处代表北泽正雄的夫人北泽洋子，对《日本与中国》报记者说，非洲人认为中国是一贯支持民族解放运动的，并且是一个靠得住的国家。她还说，中国对非洲国家的援助是努力使那个国家的经济能够独立。
    北泽洋子说，我在非洲生活了七年，体会到在非洲人的心目中，中国一贯支持解放运动。在完全独立的国家和进步人士的眼里，中国是一个靠得住的国家。
    北泽洋子说，自从苏联采取“和平共处”政策，重视同美国进行妥协以来，这一点尤为清楚。令人强烈感到，用苏联的“和平共处”政策，实际上不能够推进非洲的民族解放运动。
    正因为这样，非洲的青年人对中国有超过亲近感的东西，那就是对中国怀有这样感情：中国是一个可以学习到革命的国家。
    苏联虽然邀请了许多非洲的留学生，但是给人的感觉是，几乎是没有学到使非洲获得独立和解放的方法。但是从中国回来的留学生，就是学医学和工学的，都是对解放和独立有用处的。
    北泽洋子谈到对非洲国家的经济援助时说，非洲人认为中国是一个大国，是给与（它们）经济援助的社会主义国家。她说，中国的经济援助和苏联的作法完全不同。苏联的援助政策是为了“沽名钓誉”，因此，他们帮助修建大学或者工厂以后，大学的老师全是苏联人，工厂的工程师也是苏联人。
    然而，中国的援助是想办法使那个国家经济能够独立。中国的援助多半是一些当地人稍加学习就可以掌握而又迫切需要的项目。中国的援外贷款，是不要利息或者只要很低的利息的。苏联的援外贷款，利息相当高。
    北泽洋子说，尽管中国援助的数量不多，但是给人的印象是社会主义国家真正的援助。同时中国人尽量使用当地语言，努力同当地人过同样的生活，所以我在非洲生活七年，从来没有听过中国人的丑闻。
    北泽洋子说，现在开罗有很多的苏联人，态度相当傲慢，决不用当地的语言。他们当中出现了小偷、男女关系和走私等丑闻。因此，苏联人被非洲人认为是西洋人。
    苏联为出名而进行援助政策，不仅同美国的援助没有太大的区别，甚至给与就要堕落的人和新的殖民主义国家军事援助。非洲人实际看到，（这些援助）常被利用来镇压非洲人民的斗争。
    北泽洋子说，非洲的人们是根据行动来评价一个国家的。对中国人的评价是，有高尚风格。这一点，在非洲受到欢迎。
    中国的描写同地主斗争、抗日战争和游击战的电影受到非洲人的欢迎。
    当中国试验原子弹时，在非洲不仅是完全独立的国家，就是其他一些国家的统治阶层也认为这是西洋人以外的国家第一次进行原子弹试验而感到高兴。
