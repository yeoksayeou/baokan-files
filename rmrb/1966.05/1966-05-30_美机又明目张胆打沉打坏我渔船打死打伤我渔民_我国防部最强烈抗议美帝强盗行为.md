    US Planes Brazenly Sink and Damage Our Fishing Boats, Kill and Wound Our Fishermen
    Our Ministry of National Defense Most Strongly Protests the US Imperialist Banditry
    Spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense points out: The Johnson administration is the most savage and brutal aggressor and robber of our time. We solemnly warn the US government: it must immediately stop this piratical behavior. The great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. We will certainly settle the blood debts owed by US imperialism.
  Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: US imperialist military aircraft on the 28th once again bombed and strafed our fishing boats flying the flag of the People's Republic of China on the high seas, killing three of our fishermen and their children, wounding eighteen, sinking one of our fishing boats, and damaging three. The spokesman of our Ministry of National Defense expressed the strongest protest against this blatant and serious provocation by the US military aircraft.
    On the 28th, the No. 6503 and No. 6505 fishing boats of the Wanwei Brigade, Jiangping Commune, Dongxing Various Nationalities Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, were fishing in the northern high seas fishing grounds of Beibu Gulf. At 3:30 PM, two US military aircraft intruded over our fishing boats from the southwest and northwest directions. After circling once, they barbarously dropped seven bombs on the fishing boats and continuously strafed them with machine guns, killing our fisherman Chen Chengwei on the spot, wounding six other of our fishermen, and sinking and damaging one of our fishing boats each. On the same day at 3:50 PM, the No. 2241, No. 2242, No. 2325, and No. 2326 fishing boats of the Heping Fisheries Brigade and the Qiying Brigade, Qisha Commune, Dongxing Various Nationalities Autonomous County, were also bombed and strafed by two US imperialist military aircraft while fishing in the northern fishing grounds of Beibu Gulf. Our fisherwoman Huang Fengying and her three-year-old daughter were killed, twelve other of our fishermen were wounded, and two of our fishing boats were damaged.
    The spokesman of our Ministry of National Defense pointed out that the US government's dispatch of military aircraft to disrupt our fisheries production on the high seas and to frantically bomb and strafe our fishing boats engaged in peaceful labor, killing our fishermen, shows that the Johnson administration is the most savage and brutal aggressor and robber of our time. We resolutely protest against the US imperialist banditry. We solemnly warn the US government: it must immediately stop this piratical behavior. The great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. We will certainly settle the blood debts owed by US imperialism.

    美机又明目张胆打沉打坏我渔船打死打伤我渔民
    我国防部最强烈抗议美帝强盗行为
    国防部发言人指出：约翰逊政府是当代最野蛮、最残暴的侵略强盗。我们严正警告美国政府：必须立即停止这种海盗行为。用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民不是好惹的。美帝国主义欠下的血债，我们是一定要清算的。
  新华社二十九日讯　美帝国主义军用飞机二十八日又在公海上轰炸扫射悬挂有中华人民共和国国旗的我渔船，打死我渔民及其子女三人，打伤十八人，打沉我渔船一艘，打坏三艘。我国国防部发言人对美国军用飞机这种明目张胆的严重挑衅，表示最强烈的抗议。
    二十八日，我广西壮族自治区东兴各族自治县江平公社澫伟大队六五零三号、六五零五号渔船两艘，在北部湾的北部公海渔场捕鱼。下午三时三十分，美国军用飞机两架，分别从西南和西北方向窜入我渔船上空，在盘旋一圈后，野蛮地向渔船投下炸弹七枚，并用机枪连续扫射，当场把我渔民陈诚伟打死，打伤我另外六名渔民，打沉和打坏我渔船各一艘。同日下午三时五十分，我东兴各族自治县企沙公社和平渔业大队和企英大队的二二四一号、二二四二号、二三二五号、二三二六号渔船，在北部湾的北部渔场捕鱼时，也遭到美帝国主义军用飞机两架轰炸扫射。我渔民黄凤英和她的三岁女儿被打死，我另外十二名渔民被打伤，我渔船两艘被打坏。
    我国国防部发言人指出，美国政府派遣军用飞机在公海上破坏我渔业生产，疯狂地对从事和平劳动的我渔船进行轰炸扫射，杀害我渔民，表明约翰逊政府是当代最野蛮、最残暴的侵略强盗。我们坚决抗议美帝国主义的强盗行为。我们严正警告美国政府：必须立即停止这种海盗行为。用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民不是好惹的。美帝国主义欠下的血债，我们是一定要清算的。
