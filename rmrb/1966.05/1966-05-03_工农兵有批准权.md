    Workers, peasants, and soldiers have already approved good models of the socialist cultural revolution, such as the revolutionary modern Peking operas "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang," the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," the symphonic music "Shajiabang," and the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard," etc. Now, the ballet "The White Haired Girl" is added to this list.

    "Who determines right and wrong in history?" Marxists believe that the people are the creators of history, and the "right" and "wrong" of history should be "determined" by the people.

    Who determines right and wrong in literature and art? It should also be determined by the people. To put it plainly, good works should be approved by the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    The question of who has the right to approve was actually solved long ago.

    As early as more than twenty years ago, Chairman Mao put forward that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; for more than twenty years, Chairman Mao has been teaching us that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In that case, the workers, peasants, and soldiers naturally have the right to approve literary and artistic works.

    Workers, peasants, and soldiers have the right to approve. This right is granted by history. The reason is very clear: the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the creators of social material wealth, but also the creators of social spiritual wealth. It should be particularly pointed out that the workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. When they comment on literary and artistic works, they are full of strong class feelings, full of revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit, and always put political standards in the first place. Their opinions are the most pertinent, the most in line with the facts, and the closest to the truth.

    Is this adaptation of "The White Haired Girl" more in line with historical truth? Is the handling of the main character's image more typical? Has the ballet plus accompaniment become a "mishmash"? Does the combination of Western and national dances cancel out the characteristics of ballet? There have been debates about these in the past, and there may be debates in the future. Some people with class prejudice deny it, and some people are skeptical. However, "the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers like it very much." Take the accompaniment singing, for example. The workers, peasants, and soldiers praised it as "politics taking the lead, ballet opening its mouth." Ballet opening its mouth, having dance and song, so that workers, peasants, and soldiers can understand it, what's wrong with that? It's very good!

    The socialist cultural revolution has both destruction and construction, destroying bourgeois things and establishing proletarian things. To achieve this, we must promote "collective wisdom" and oppose "one person's word." "Collective wisdom" means following the mass line, being good at listening to the opinions of the broad masses; of course, we must also be good at analyzing opinions, absorbing the good ones and not absorbing the bad ones. We must not be afraid of the masses, we must firmly believe in the masses, and the masses will give us many valuable opinions.

    Needless to say, in "collective wisdom," the workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy a majority position. We must hand over literary and artistic works to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for review, we must let the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers gradually master the weapon of literary and artistic criticism, let them fully use the right of approval, break the monopoly of literary and artistic criticism by a few so-called "literary critics" (referring to those critics with wrong direction and weak abilities), completely disarm those "literary critics" who promote bourgeois ideology and use terminology to intimidate people, carry out militant mass literary and artistic criticism, and combine true professional critics with mass critics to powerfully promote the socialist great revolution on the literary and artistic front.

    工农兵有批准权
                              辛午
    得到广大工农兵群众批准的社会主义文化大革命的好样板，已经有革命现代京剧《红灯记》《沙家浜》等，有芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，有交响乐《沙家浜》，有泥塑《收租院》，等等。现在，又加进一个芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。
    “青史凭谁定是非？”马克思主义者认为，人民群众是历史的创造者，历史的“是”和“非”应当由人民群众来“定”。
    文艺凭谁定是非？也应当由人民群众来定。说得明白一点，好的作品应该由工农兵群众来批准。
    谁有批准权，这个问题本来早就解决了的。
    早在二十多年前，毛主席就提出文艺要为工农兵服务；二十多年来，毛主席又一直在教导我们，文艺要为工农兵服务。既然如此，工农兵自然有对文艺作品的批准权。
    工农兵有批准权。这个权，是历史授予的。道理很明白：工农兵群众不仅是社会物质财富的创造者，而且是社会精神财富的创造者。应该特别指出的是：我国的工农兵群众是由毛泽东思想武装起来的。他们在评论文艺作品的时候，洋溢着强烈的阶级感情，充满着革命精神和战斗精神，总是把政治标准放在第一位的。他们的意见最中肯，最符合事实，最接近真理。
    《白毛女》这样改编是不是更符合历史真实？主要人物形象这样处理是不是更典型？芭蕾舞加伴唱是不是变成了“四不象”？洋舞蹈和民族舞蹈结合是不是取消了芭蕾舞的特点？对于这些，过去有过而且今后可能还会有争论。那些存有阶级偏见的人是否定的，还有一些人是怀疑的。可是，“广大工农兵群众十分喜欢”。就拿伴唱来说，工农兵称赞这是“政治带了头，芭蕾开了口”。芭蕾开口，有舞有唱，让工农兵都能看懂听懂，有什么不好呢？好得很！
    社会主义文化大革命有破有立，破资产阶级的东西，立无产阶级的东西。要做到这一点，必须提倡“群言堂”，反对“一言堂”。“群言堂”就是走群众路线，善于倾听广大群众的意见；当然，还要善于分析意见，好的就吸收，不好的就不吸收。我们不要怕群众，要坚决地相信群众，群众会给我们提出许多宝贵的意见。
    不用说，在“群言堂”中，工农兵占有多数地位。我们要把文艺作品交给工农兵群众去审查，我们要让工农兵群众逐步掌握文艺批评的武器，让他们充分使用批准权，打破少数所谓“文艺批评家”（指那些方向错误和软弱无力的批评家）对文艺批评的垄断，彻底缴掉那些宣扬资产阶级思想，用名词术语吓人的“文艺批评家”的械，开展战斗的群众性的文艺批评，并且使真正的专门批评家和群众批评家结合起来，有力地促进文艺战线的社会主义大革命。
