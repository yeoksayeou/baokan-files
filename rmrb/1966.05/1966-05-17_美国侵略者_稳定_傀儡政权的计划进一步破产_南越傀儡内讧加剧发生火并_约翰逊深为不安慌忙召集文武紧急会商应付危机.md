    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 16th) Reports: The prolonged infighting between the U.S. lackeys Nguyễn Cao Kỳ - Nguyễn Văn Thiệu clique in South Vietnam and the Nguyễn Chánh Thi clique in the Đà Nẵng and Huế areas of central Vietnam erupted into armed conflict on the 15th.
    According to Western news agencies, at dawn on the 15th, the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ clique airlifted two battalions of puppet marines to Đà Nẵng and launched a surprise attack, occupying the puppet First Military Region headquarters, radio station, radio transmitter, and other important institutions after a brief exchange of fire. Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and puppet "Defense Minister" Nguyễn Hữu Có flew to Đà Nẵng to personally supervise the battle.
    Reports say that in Đà Nẵng, local puppet troops belonging to the Nguyễn Chánh Thi clique are still resisting, occupying "two major Buddhist temples, the stadium, and surrounding areas." Other troops of the Nguyễn Chánh Thi clique have gathered in Huế, northwest of Đà Nẵng. Roadblocks and checkpoints have been set up on the highway from Đà Nẵng to Huế. Troops of the puppet First Division on the 16th had taken control of the Huế airport, "deploying tanks and troops," warning Nguyễn Cao Kỳ's troops not to land there.
    The newly appointed commander of the puppet First Military Region, Tôn Thất Đính, delivered a recorded speech on the Huế radio station on the evening of the 15th, accusing Nguyễn Cao Kỳ of "launching a civil war" and calling on the puppet troops to rise up against Nguyễn Cao Kỳ.
    The internal armed conflict within the South Vietnamese puppet clique has caused a new wave of chaos in the U.S.-puppet occupied areas. The Saigon Buddhist Association issued a statement on the evening of the 15th, condemning the puppet government's "treacherous and irresponsible behavior" and calling on Buddhists "to prepare in a spirit of self-defense." On the same day, about 5,000 pro-Nguyễn Cao Kỳ Catholics held an anti-Buddhist parade in Saigon.
    According to reports, the Johnson administration is deeply disturbed by the internal armed conflict within the South Vietnamese puppet clique. After the news reached Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in South Vietnam, attended by Defense Secretary McNamara, U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam Lodge, U.S. Presidential Advisor Rostow, and Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Bundy, among others. On the afternoon of the 15th, Johnson convened Rusk, McNamara, Lodge, and other senior officials at the White House for an emergency discussion of the "new crisis" in South Vietnam. Apparently concerned that this crisis would jeopardize "anti-communist efforts" and the U.S.-directed "civilian government," State Department spokesman Wright said on the 15th that the U.S. government had instructed U.S. officials in South Vietnam to "make every effort to persuade South Vietnamese leaders to discuss and resolve their differences together."

    美国侵略者“稳定”傀儡政权的计划进一步破产
    南越傀儡内讧加剧发生火并
    约翰逊深为不安慌忙召集文武紧急会商应付危机
    据新华社十六日讯　西贡消息：美国的南越走狗阮高其—阮文绍集团，同中部岘港、顺化地区阮正诗集团持久的内讧，在十五日爆发为火并。
    据西方通讯社报道，十五日凌晨，阮高其集团空运两个营的伪海军陆战队到岘港，突然发动袭击，并在短时交火后占领了这个城市的伪第一军区总部、电台、无线电发射台和其他重要机关。阮高其和伪“国防部长”阮友固曾飞到岘港亲自督战。
    报道说，在岘港市，属于阮正诗集团的当地伪军仍在抵抗，占据着“两个主要佛寺、运动场和周围地区”，阮正诗集团的另一些军队已在岘港的西北面的顺化市集合起来。岘港通往顺化的公路上已设置路障和哨所。伪第一师的部队十六日已控制了顺化机场，“部署了坦克和军队”，警告阮高其的军队不要在这里降陆。
    刚上任不久的伪第一军区司令孙室订十五日晚在顺化电台发表录音讲话，指责阮高其“发动内战”，号召伪军起来反对阮高其。
    南越傀儡集团内部的火并，在美伪占领区引起了一片新的混乱。西贡的佛教联合会在十五日晚发表声明，谴责傀儡政府的“这种背叛行为和不负责任”，号召佛教徒“要以自卫精神作好准备”。同一天，亲阮高其集团的天主教徒约五千人在西贡举行了反佛教徒的游行。
    据报道，约翰逊政府对于南越傀儡集团内部的火并深为不安。在消息传到华盛顿后，美国国务卿腊斯克当即召开紧急会议讨论南越局势，参加会议的有国防部长麦克纳马拉、美国驻南越“大使”洛奇、美国总统顾问罗斯托和远东事务助理国务卿邦迪等。十五日下午，约翰逊又召集了腊斯克、麦克纳马拉和洛奇等高级官员在白宫紧急讨论了南越的“新危机”。显然由于担心这种危机将危及“反共努力”和美国导演的“文官政府”，国务院发言人赖特十五日说，美国政府已经指示在南越的美国官员“作一切努力去说服南越各派领袖共同讨论解决他们的分歧”。
