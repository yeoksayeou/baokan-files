    Saigon (Xinhua News Agency) report, May 20: The infighting between the two major puppet groups in South Vietnam is escalating. Fierce street fighting has erupted in Da Nang in the past two days, and the atmosphere in Hue and Saigon is also very tense. New divisions have emerged within the Nguyen Cao Ky clique, making the situation even more chaotic.
    According to Western news agencies, the fierce street fighting in Da Nang began on the 19th. Puppet troops of the Nguyen Cao Ky clique launched an offensive against puppet troops of the Nguyen Chanh Thi clique who were entrenched in temple areas. During the exchange of fire, both sides used machine guns, grenades, and small arms. The fighting intensified on the 20th.
    In Hue, local puppet troops opened fire on airplanes of the Nguyen Cao Ky clique that were dropping leaflets on the 19th. The Hue "Struggle Committee," supported by Buddhists, announced on the 20th that 5,000 puppet troops would go to Da Nang to aid the anti-Nguyen Cao Ky "Buddhist brothers" there. At the same time, news reports said that part of the Nguyen Cao Ky clique's puppet troops had left Da Nang and were "already less than fifty kilometers from Hue." The Nguyen Cao Ky clique has cut off important supplies to Hue.
    As the protracted infighting between the two major groups becomes increasingly heated, the shaky Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime is further splitting. Nguyen Ngoc Loan, the puppet police chief of Saigon, recently had a dispute with Hoang Van Cao, the newly appointed puppet commander of the First Military Region, in Da Nang due to disagreements. On the 18th, the Secretary of State for Inspection of the Saigon puppet government cabinet resigned, opposing Nguyen Cao Ky's policies toward central South Vietnam. The chief of staff of the First Tactical Zone Command also announced his resignation on the 19th. Meanwhile, anti-Nguyen Cao Ky activities by Buddhists in Saigon are becoming more frequent. More than a thousand Buddhist youths held a demonstration against the Nguyen Cao Ky clique in the streets on the evening of the 18th. Banners held by the demonstrators read: "Down with the Americans who helped Nguyen Cao Ky send troops to Da Nang."

    南越傀儡火并激烈，内部发生新的分化
    西贡千余佛教青年示威反对美国—阮高其集团
    据新华社二十日讯　西贡消息：南越两大傀儡集团爆发的火并愈演愈烈。近两天来在岘港市内发生激烈巷战，顺化和西贡两市的气氛也十分紧张。阮高其集团内部发生新的分化，局势更加混乱。
    据西方通讯社报道，岘港市激烈的巷战是十九日开始的。阮高其集团的伪军向据守寺院地区的阮正诗集团的伪军发动进攻。在交火时，双方使用了机枪、手榴弹和轻武器。二十日，战斗更加激烈。
    在顺化市，当地伪军十九日向投传单的阮高其集团的飞机开了火。佛教徒所支持的顺化市“斗争委员会”二十日宣布，有五千名伪军将去岘港援助那里的反阮高其的“佛教徒兄弟”。在这同时，有消息说，阮高其集团的部分伪军从岘港开出，“已经开到距离顺化不到五十公里的地方”。阮高其集团已经切断了对顺化市的重要供应。
    在两大集团旷日持久的内讧日益白热化的情况下，摇摇欲坠的阮高其傀儡政权内部进一步分裂。西贡的伪警察首脑阮玉銮最近曾在岘港同新上任的伪第一军区司令黄文高因意见不合而发生了争吵。十八日，西贡傀儡政府内阁的稽查国务秘书辞职，反对阮高其对南越中部采取的政策。伪第一战术区司令部的参谋长十九日也宣布辞职。与此同时，西贡市佛教徒反阮高其的活动更加频繁。有一千多名佛教青年，十八日晚在大街上举行了反对阮高其集团的示威。示威者中举着的横幅上写着：“打倒帮助阮高其派兵去岘港的美国人”。
