    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Chinese Foreign Ministry handed a note to the Indian Embassy in China on the 4th, refuting the Indian government's groundless slander of Chinese invasion in response to three notes from the Indian government dated February 2, February 3, and February 8, 1966. The note pointed out that this is clearly an attempt to confuse the public and cover up the fact of Indian invasion.

    The note said: "The Indian side's notes repeatedly state that Chinese troops entered the twenty-kilometer area on the Chinese side of the actual line of control on the Sino-Indian border, and the Langjiu and Che Dong areas which China voluntarily vacated and did not establish civilian checkpoints, violating its own promises and the provisions of the Colombo Proposals. This is completely nonsense."

    The note pointed out: "The aforementioned twenty-kilometer area and the Langjiu, Che Dong, etc. areas are all Chinese territory. After the Chinese side repelled the Indian side's armed offensive in the winter of 1962, in order to seek to ease the border situation, it voluntarily withdrew border troops to twenty kilometers beyond its side of the actual line of control between China and India, and decided not to even establish civilian checkpoints in Langjiu, Che Dong, Ure, and the disputed areas in the ceasefire arrangements in the western sector of the Sino-Indian border. This fully demonstrates China's sincerity in seeking a peaceful solution to the border issue. The statements and documents of the Chinese government and its leaders quoted in the Indian side's notes convincingly illustrate this point."

    The note said that China's actions were by no means a surrender of its territorial sovereignty, nor did they mean abandoning the right to take precautionary and self-defense measures against Indian provocation and invasion. When taking the aforementioned withdrawal measures, the Chinese government solemnly demanded that the Indian side "no longer carry out provocations, no longer enter the four disputed areas in the ceasefire arrangements," and "correctly understand China's peaceful efforts and respond favorably to them." At the same time, the Chinese government solemnly declared that if the Indian side disregards China's proactive efforts and continues to invade and provoke, "China reserves the right to conduct self-defense and counterattacks, and the Indian government must bear all responsibility for all serious consequences arising therefrom." "The Chinese government hopes that history will not repeat itself, but if it unfortunately does, the Chinese government believes that the whole world will be able to see more clearly who should be responsible for the tension on the Sino-Indian border." The Chinese government's words are clear and unambiguous.

    The note emphasized that for the past three years, the Indian side has not only failed to respond positively to China's proactive measures, but has also continuously invaded and provoked on the Sino-Indian and China-Sikkim borders, destroying the twenty-kilometer demilitarized zone on the Chinese side of the actual line of control on the Sino-Indian border, and even repeatedly intruded into areas such as Langjiu, Che Dong, and Ure, where China voluntarily did not establish civilian checkpoints. In the three years from the end of 1962 to the end of 1965, the Indian side carried out as many as 374 intrusions from the ground and air. What is particularly serious is that the invading Indian troops repeatedly provoked armed conflicts in the second half of 1965. In the face of this serious situation, the Chinese government certainly had to take necessary precautionary and self-defense measures. The Chinese government said so and did so. The Indian government's attempt to distort China's proactive withdrawal measures, to force China to make concessions to India's expansionist and aggressive policies, and not to stop them, is absolutely impossible.

    The note said: "As for accusing China of violating the Colombo Proposals, that is even more absurd. First of all, since the Colombo Proposals are only proposals, there is no question of violating them. Secondly, it must be pointed out that the Colombo Proposals themselves were produced under the circumstances that China took a series of proactive measures. China's withdrawal of border troops twenty kilometers from the entire line of actual control and the non-establishment of civilian checkpoints in four areas such as Langjiu and Che Dong are all actions that far exceed the recommendations of the Colombo Conference. However, the Indian government only shouts slogans of accepting the Colombo Proposals, but in reality, it has not made any positive response. On the contrary, the Indian side has proved with its own invasion actions that it has long thrown the Colombo Proposals to the winds. The Indian side is obviously only using the Colombo Proposals as a tool to force China to make unilateral concessions, attempting to allow China to let the Indian side recklessly re-invade and provoke. In this case, it is a great self-irony that the Indian side is still talking about its Colombo Proposals there."

    The note, when discussing the actual line of control between the two sides of the Sino-Indian border, once again pointed out that the reason why this line is different from the traditional customary boundary line between China and India is entirely due to the fact that India has occupied a large amount of Chinese territory. This line in the western sector is roughly the traditional customary boundary, which is an objective reality that cannot be denied. In the eastern sector, the Chinese side, out of the desire to maintain the status quo and await the settlement of the border issue, decided not to cross the so-called McMahon Line, which is why this line became the actual line of control between the two sides. However, this has not changed the illegality of the "McMahon Line" in the slightest. India's insatiable and unlimited territorial expansion ambitions are intolerable to any sovereign state. India's ambition to illegally occupy Chinese territory forever will never succeed.

    The note said: "Regarding the China-Sikkim border, it is very clear that the current problem is that India not only stations a large number of troops in Sikkim, but also constantly crosses the already demarcated border between China and Sikkim, intruding into Chinese territory and provoking conflicts. Saying that China is attempting to 'damage the special close relationship that exists between India and Sikkim' and 'exert military pressure on Sikkim' is utter nonsense. What is the 'special close relationship' between India and Sikkim? To put it bluntly, it is the so-called protection and being protected relationship that the Indian government inherited from British imperialism's aggression and imposed on the people of Sikkim. To be honest, this unequal relationship of big countries bullying small countries and harming the sovereignty of small countries has long been rejected by the people of the world, especially the awakened African and Asian people. It is extremely disgraceful for India to try to maintain this relationship. As for saying that someone is 'exerting military pressure on Sikkim,' it is not China, but India, which is strengthening its military control over Sikkim in the name of 'defense.' Isn't the matter obvious?"

    The note concluded: "As the Chinese government has repeatedly pointed out, the Indian side, whether it is invading the border or falsely accusing China, is for the needs of its domestic and foreign policies. Although the Indian government vehemently denies it, it cannot change the objective reality. Recently, in order to ask US imperialism and modern revisionists for food and money to solve the serious food shortage and economic difficulties at home, the Indian Prime Minister has repeatedly slandered China as a 'threat,' clamoring for 'containing China,' and also boasted about India's 'contributions' on the Sino-Indian border, hoping to get more 'attention' and 'gratitude.' This can only make the world see more clearly what role the Indian government is playing on the current international stage. We would like to solemnly warn the Indian government that as an Asian country, constantly colluding with imperialism and its accomplices, even at the cost of selling itself out and becoming their lackey, will not bring any benefits to its own country. As for attempting to implement expansionism and invade neighboring countries, it will only create more disasters for its own people and nothing else."

    我外交部照会驳斥印度政府反诬中国入侵的谰言
    印度政府贼喊捉贼掩盖不了入侵中国领土事实
    照会正告印度政府勾结帝国主义及其帮凶进行反华决不会有好下场
    新华社六日讯　中国外交部四日把一件照会交给印度驻华大使馆，就印度政府一九六六年二月二日、二月三日和二月八日的三件来照，驳斥印度政府凭空诬蔑中国入侵等谰言。照会指出，这显然是妄图混淆视听，掩盖印方入侵的事实。
    照会说：“印方来照反复说什么，中国部队进入了中印边界实际控制线中国一侧的二十公里地区和中国主动空出、不设民政检查站的朗久、扯冬等地区，违背了自己的诺言和科伦坡建议的规定。这完全是无稽之谈。”
    照会指出：“上述二十公里地区和朗久、扯冬等地区都是中国领土。中国方面在一九六二年冬打退了印方的武装进攻之后，为了谋求缓和边境局势，才主动把边防部队撤到中印双方实际控制线本侧二十公里以外，并且决定在朗久、扯冬、乌热和中印边界西段停火安排中有争议的地区，连民政检查站也不设立。这充分表明了中国谋求和平解决边界问题的诚意。印方来照引述的当时中国政府及其领导人的声明和文件，恰恰令人信服地说明了这一点。”
    照会说，中国这样做，绝不是放弃自己的领土主权；也绝不意味着放弃对印方的入侵挑衅采取警戒和自卫措施的权利。中国政府在采取上述后撤等措施时，就严正要求印方“不再进行挑衅，不再进入停火安排中有争议的四个地区”，“正确理解中国方面的和平努力，并对此作出有利的响应。”同时，中国政府郑重声明，如果印方不顾中国的主动努力而继续入侵挑衅，“中国保留进行自卫还击的权利，由此而产生的一切严重后果必须由印度政府承担全部责任。”“中国政府希望，历史不至于重演，如果不幸竟然重演的话，中国政府相信，全世界也将能更清楚地看出，谁应该对中印边境的紧张局势负责。”中国政府的话是说得一清二楚，毫不含糊的。
    照会强调指出，三年来，印方不仅没有对中国的主动措施作出任何积极响应，反而在中印和中国—锡金边境不断入侵挑衅，破坏了中印边界实际控制线中国一边的二十公里非军事区，甚至多次侵入了朗久、扯冬、乌热等中国主动不设民政检查站的地区。在一九六二年末至一九六五年底的三年中，印方从地面和空中的入侵活动已达三百七十四次之多。尤其严重的是，入侵印军在一九六五年下半年内还多次挑起武装冲突。面对着这种严重情况，中国政府当然要采取必要的警戒和自卫措施。中国政府是这样说的，也是这样做的。印度政府妄想曲解中国的主动后撤措施，要中国对印方的扩张主义和侵略政策一味忍让，不加制止，那是绝对办不到的。
    照会说：“至于指责中国违反了科伦坡建议，那更是荒谬之至。首先，科伦坡建议既然只是个建议，就根本不存在违反不违反的问题。其次，必须指出，科伦坡建议本身就是在中国采取一系列主动措施的情况下产生的。中国把边防部队从实际控制线全线后撤二十公里，不在朗久、扯冬等四个地区设立民政检查站，这些实际行动都大大超过了科伦坡会议的建议。而印度政府空喊接受科伦坡建议，实际上并没有作出任何积极响应。相反，印方却以自己的入侵行动证明，它早已把科伦坡建议抛到九霄云外。印方显然只是利用科伦坡建议作为迫使中国单方面退让的工具，企图让中国听任印方放肆地重新入侵挑衅。在这种情况下，印方居然还在那里大谈其科伦坡建议，真是莫大的自我讽刺。”
    照会在谈到中印边界的双方实际控制线时再次指出，这条线同中印传统习惯边界线之所以有区别，完全是由于印度侵占了大片中国领土的结果。这条线在西段，大体上就是传统习惯边界，这是客观存在，不容否认。在东段，中国方面从维护现状，以待边界问题解决的愿望出发，决定不越过所谓麦克马洪线，这条线才成为双方的实际控制线。但是这丝毫也没有改变“麦克马洪线”的非法性。印度方面得寸进尺、漫无止境的领土扩张野心是任何主权国家所不能容忍的。印度企图永远非法霸占中国领土的野心，是绝对不会得逞的。
    照会说：“关于中锡边界，十分明显，当前的问题是，印度不仅在锡金大量驻军，而且不断越过中锡之间已经划定的边界，侵入中国境内，挑起冲突。说什么中国企图‘损害存在于印锡之间的特殊亲密关系’。‘对锡金施加军事压力’，真是一派胡言。什么是印锡之间的‘特殊亲密关系’呢？说穿了，就是印度政府继承英帝国主义的侵略衣钵，强加在锡金人民头上的所谓保护与被保护的关系。老实说，这种大国欺压小国、损害小国主权的不平等关系，早就被全世界人民，特别是觉醒了的亚非人民所唾弃。印度还竭力保住这种关系，是极不光采的。至于说有人‘对锡金施加军事压力’，那倒不是中国，而正是假借‘保卫’之名，对锡金加强军事控制的印度，事情难道不是明摆着的吗？”
    照会最后说：“正如中国政府所一再指出，印方不论是在边境入侵也好，反诬中国也好，都是为了它内政外交的需要。印度政府虽然矢口否认，却改变不了客观实际。最近，印度总理为了向美帝国主义和现代修正主义者要粮要钱，来解决国内严重的粮荒和经济困难，不惜一再诬蔑中国‘威胁’，叫嚷‘必须遏制中国’，而且还吹嘘印度在中印边境作出的‘贡献’，期望得到更多的‘注意’和‘感谢’。这只能使全世界看得更清楚，印度政府在当前国际舞台上扮演着什么角色。我们愿意正告印度政府，作为一个亚洲国家，老是同帝国主义和它的帮凶勾结在一起，甚至不惜卖身投靠，替他们作走卒，是不会为自己国家带来任何好处的。至于妄图实行扩张主义，对邻国进行侵略，除了给本国人民制造更多灾难外，是别无其他下场的。”
