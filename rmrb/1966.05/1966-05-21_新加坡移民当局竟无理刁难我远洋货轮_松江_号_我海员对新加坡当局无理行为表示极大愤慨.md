    Singapore Immigration Authorities Unreasonably Harass Our Ocean Freighter "Songjiang"
    Our Sailors Express Great Indignation at the Unreasonable Actions of the Singapore Authorities
    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th. This reporter learned from the Ministry of Communications: Singapore immigration authorities have discriminated against and unreasonably harassed the Chinese ocean freighter "Songjiang," forcing the "Songjiang" to fail to enter the port of Singapore to load cargo. This unfriendly behavior of the Singapore immigration authorities towards the Chinese people has aroused great indignation among Chinese sailors.
    When the Chinese ocean freighter "Songjiang" arrived in Singapore on the afternoon of May 18, the Singapore immigration authorities pointed out that the captain of the "Songjiang" had to sign a guarantee, including a guarantee that the crew would not be allowed to disembark, otherwise the "Songjiang" would not be allowed to enter the port to load cargo. The captain of the "Songjiang" immediately pointed out that this was a violation of international practice by the Singapore immigration authorities, a discrimination and unreasonable harassment against Chinese sailors, and an extremely unfriendly behavior towards the Chinese people, and resolutely refused to sign the above-mentioned guarantee. On the same day, the "Songjiang" was forced to leave Singapore without entering the port to load cargo. Before leaving, the captain of the "Songjiang" lodged a written protest with the Singapore immigration authorities regarding this matter.
      The "Songjiang" is a freighter leased by the China Ocean Shipping Company to the Chinese-Polish Joint Stock Shipping Company. The "Songjiang" sails to major ports in Asia and Europe and has always been treated friendly by the people of all countries. Chinese sailors expressed great indignation at the discrimination and unreasonable harassment by the Singapore immigration authorities.

    新加坡移民当局竟无理刁难我远洋货轮“松江”号
    我海员对新加坡当局无理行为表示极大愤慨
    新华社二十日讯　本社记者从交通部获悉：新加坡移民当局对中国远洋货轮“松江”号进行歧视和无理刁难，迫使“松江”轮未能进入新加坡港口装货。新加坡移民当局对中国人民的这种不友好行为，激起了中国海员的极大愤慨。
    中国远洋货轮“松江”号在五月十八日下午驶抵新加坡时，新加坡移民当局竟指出要“松江”轮船长签署包括保证船员不得上岸等内容的保证书，否则不准“松江”轮进港装货。“松江”轮船长当即指出，这是新加坡移民当局违反国际惯例，对中国海员进行歧视和无理刁难，是对中国人民极不友好的行为，并且坚决拒绝在上述保证书上签字。当天，“松江”轮被迫未能进港装货而驶离新加坡。在驶离前，“松江”轮船长就此事向新加坡移民当局提出了书面抗议。
      “松江”轮是中国远洋运输公司租给中波海运公司的货轮，“松江”轮行驶亚、欧各大港口，一贯受到各国人民的友好相待。中国海员对新加坡移民当局的歧视和无理刁难表示极大愤慨。
