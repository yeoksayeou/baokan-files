    To Strike the Snake, Seal the Hole
    Member of Chengyu Commune, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, Liu Qianxiang
    I am a rural woman. A few days ago, I heard that some people were opposing socialism, so I hurried to listen to the radio. The loudspeaker said that there were people called Deng Tuo and Wu Han who were opposing our beloved Communist Party and Chairman Mao, opposing socialism, and saying that they wanted our Party to "rest." What kind of talk is this! The people who say these things are truly big bad guys. Wu Han is like a poisonous snake, opening its mouth and trying to bite us. Seeing that we want to strike it, it crawls into its hole. This hole is Deng Tuo and his other accomplices. I really wish I could immediately pick up a hoe, chop this poisonous snake into several sections, and block and dig out its old lair.
    In the old society, we poor people were oppressed and exploited, without food or clothing, living a life worse than cattle or horses, precisely because there were landlords and capitalists, like poisonous snakes, causing trouble. We longed and yearned for liberation, and finally Chairman Mao and the Communist Party led us poor people to stand up. We women, like men, also became masters of the country. But these ghosts and monsters who are unwilling to die are now running out to oppose us and sabotage us. They want to bite us like poisonous snakes. This will not do! We poor people are not afraid. We must take up our weapons and strike down all these ghosts and monsters, so that they can never stand up again!

    要打蛇更要塞洞
    四川省资中县成于公社社员　刘钱香
    我是一个农村妇女。前几天听说有伙人反对社会主义，就赶快去听广播。喇叭里说，有叫邓拓和吴晗的，反对我们敬爱的共产党和毛主席，反对社会主义，说什么要叫我们的党“休息”，这是什么话！说这些话的人，真是大坏蛋。吴晗就象毒蛇一样，张着嘴跑来想咬我们，看见我们要打它，它就朝洞里钻。这个洞就是邓拓和他的其他同伙。我真恨不得马上拿起锄头把这条毒蛇斩成几节，把它的老洞堵死、挖掉。
    在旧社会，我们穷人受压迫受剥削，没有吃，没有穿，过着牛马不如的生活，就是因为有象毒蛇一样的地主资本家在作怪。盼星星，盼月亮，好容易盼到了解放，毛主席和共产党领导我们穷人翻了身，我们妇女和男人一样也成了国家的主人。可是，这些不甘心死亡的牛鬼蛇神，现在跑出来反对我们，破坏我们，他们象毒蛇一样想咬我们。这是不行的！我们穷人是不会害怕的，我们一定要拿起家伙来，把这些牛鬼蛇神通通打倒，叫它们永远不得翻身！
