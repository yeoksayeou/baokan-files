    American youth's struggle against conscription is flourishing, a sign of their growing awareness. It foreshadows a new storm in the American people's movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam.
    The American youth's anti-conscription struggle has always been an important component of the American people's increasingly strong movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam. After the Johnson government's disastrous "dry season offensive," it has continued to send troops to South Vietnam, intensified its search for cannon fodder at home and abroad, and expanded the war of aggression in Vietnam. However, under the increasing opposition of the American people, the Johnson government's conscription has not been smooth. It has even played tricks with so-called "intelligence tests" in schools, attempting to send large numbers of students to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder. This, of course, cannot help but add fuel to the fire, further arousing strong opposition from American youth and the American people, thereby further sharpening the contradiction between the American people and the American ruling clique.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "The nature of a war determines the relationship between the government and the people; this is a historical principle." The reason why American youth refuse to serve in the army is precisely because they increasingly see that the war waged by the Johnson government in South Vietnam is an unjust war of aggression that harms the interests of the Vietnamese people and violates the interests of the American people. The American people and youth resolutely stand with the Vietnamese people, oppose their own imperialist government, and bravely shout the slogan "Smash Johnson Imperialism." This is not accidental.
    Youth who are increasingly aware and rising up to participate in the struggle against reactionaries are always a vigorous force in the revolutionary ranks, and play an important role in the rise and development of the revolution. This will be no exception in the United States. From opposing conscription to opposing their own imperialist government, American youth will greatly promote the development of the American people's movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam. No matter how the Johnson government carries out suppression or plays tricks, it cannot stop the just struggle of the American people.

    美国青年在觉醒
    目前，美国青年反对征兵的斗争正在蓬勃发展，这是美国青年日益觉醒的标志。它预示着美国人民反对侵越战争运动将要兴起新的风暴。
    美国青年反征兵斗争，一直是美国人民一浪高一浪的反对侵越战争运动的重要组成部分。约翰逊政府在“旱季攻势”惨败以后，不断增派军队去南越，加紧在国内外搜罗炮灰，扩大侵越战争。但是，约翰逊政府在美国人民日益强烈的反对下，征兵很不顺利，它竟在学校中玩弄所谓“智力测验”的鬼把戏，企图把大批学生送往南越充当炮灰。这当然不能不火上加油，进一步激起美国青年和美国人民的强烈反对，从而使美国人民同美国统治集团的矛盾更加尖锐化。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：“战争的性质决定政府和人民的关系，这是一个历史的原则。”美国青年所以拒绝当兵，正是因为他们越来越看清约翰逊政府在南越进行的战争，是一场既损害越南人民利益、也违反美国人民利益的非正义的侵略战争。美国人民和青年毅然决然同越南人民站在一起，反对本国帝国主义政府，英勇地喊出了“粉碎约翰逊帝国主义”的口号，这不是偶然的。
    日益觉醒和起来参加反对反动派斗争的青年，总是革命力量的一支生力军，并在革命的兴起和发展中起着重要的作用。这在美国，也不会是例外。美国青年从反对征兵到反对本国帝国主义，必将大大推动美国人民反对侵越战争运动的开展。不管约翰逊政府怎样进行镇压，怎样玩弄花招，都阻挡不了美国人民的正义斗争。
