    Found the "Key" to Doing a Good Job in Branch Work
           Chen Ronghua, Party Branch Secretary of Xinmin Brigade, Xinba Commune, Guiding County, Guizhou Province
    In the past, I often talked about the importance of politics, but when I started working, I only focused on production. Especially when production was not going well, I would run around alone from one team to another, grabbing at everything. Although I was very "hardworking," production still couldn't go up. At this time, I always blamed everyone for not being proactive. As a result, my relationship with the cadres and the masses deteriorated. I blamed others, and others also had opinions about me. What should I do? After discussing it with the branch committee members, I held a Party member meeting specifically to study Chairman Mao's "Combat Liberalism," asking everyone to offer criticism and to give opinions on the branch leadership, especially me. Many comrades said that I didn't trust the masses, didn't rely on everyone to do the work; that when the higher authorities assigned tasks, I only talked about completing them, not about why they should be completed; and they also criticized me for not caring enough about class brothers, rarely helping them solve practical difficulties, and only complaining that they were not proactive.
    After this Party member meeting, I deeply realized that the reason why the branch work was not done well and production could not go up was mainly because I had not highlighted politics, had not creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, had not used Mao Zedong Thought to command the branch work, had neglected the work of working with people, and had not grasped the ideological revolutionization of people. Later, I attached importance to creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. When holding Party member meetings or cadre meetings, I would bring up the issues that needed to be resolved, first study Chairman Mao's relevant articles, and then conduct discussions. The effect of doing this was very good.
    Let me give you an example. Last winter, when building water conservancy projects, Xinmin Production Team had a "drum well." The wellhead was small, and the water flowed very little. Expanding the wellhead could solve the drought problem for a piece of farmland. But at that time, a few commune members disagreed with opening the wellhead, saying: Opening this well would take a lot of work and would be difficult. After hearing this feedback, the branch immediately convened a branch meeting and organized the study of the two articles "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." This made everyone realize the role of opening the wellhead and diverting water for irrigation in promoting agricultural production, and mobilized everyone to overcome difficulties and seize high yields. After the Party unified its understanding, the Party members went separately to mobilize the masses. Party member Chen Chaoda led the Party members, cadres, and several commune members of Xinmin Production Team to start blasting the wellhead first. After only blasting a zhang or so deep, the water flowed more than before. After the water flowed into the fields, the Party branch organized the commune members to visit, which greatly educated the masses.
    In my work, I also pay more attention to understanding the actual situation, publicizing to the masses, and paying attention to solving the difficulties of the masses. Mo Kaili, a Party member of our branch, lives more than ten li away from the brigade. In the past, I didn't go to his place often, and I didn't know much about his poor housing conditions and his illness, and I didn't care enough. I only blamed him for not being active enough in his work and production. Later, I read Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The attitude of Communists towards backward people is not to despise them, to look down on them, but to be close to them, to unite them, to persuade them, and to encourage them to move forward." According to Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, I took the initiative to talk to Mo Kaili and help him solve his difficulties. As a result, Mo Kaili himself examined his past mistakes of not working actively and not taking the lead in production. Later, he was very active in both work and production. Last autumn, when delivering public grain, his child died of illness, and he himself was not feeling well. However, he did not consider himself, but still actively led the masses to deliver public grain, enabling the Hongyan Production Team where he was located to complete the task ahead of schedule.
    In the future, I will better highlight politics and let Mao Zedong Thought take command in all our work.

### 找到了做好支部工作的“钥匙”

    找到了做好支部工作的“钥匙”
           贵州省贵定县新巴公社新民大队党支部书记　陈荣华
    过去，我也经常讲政治重要，但一做起工作来，就只在生产上打转转。特别是在生产上不去的时候，就一个人从这个队到那个队到处跑，到处抓。尽管很“辛苦”，但是生产还是不能上去。这时，我心里总怪大家不积极干。这样一来，我同干部、群众的关系搞得不大好。我怪别人，而别人对我也有意见。怎么办呢？我同支部委员商量后，召开了一次党员大会，专门学习毛主席的《反对自由主义》，要求大家展开批评，对支部领导，特别是对我提意见。许多同志说我不相信群众，不依靠大家搞工作；说上级布置了任务，只讲要完成，不讲为什么要完成；同时还批评我对阶级兄弟不够关心，很少帮助他们解决实际困难，只是埋怨他们不积极。
    这次党员大会以后，使我深刻地认识到，支部工作没做好，生产搞不上去，主要是我没有突出政治，没有活学活用毛主席著作，没有用毛泽东思想来统帅支部工作，忽视了做人的工作，没有抓人的思想革命化。后来，我重视了活学活用毛主席著作，开党员大会或者干部会，就带着需要解决的问题，首先学习毛主席的有关文章，然后再进行讨论，这样做的效果很好。
    举个例子来说吧，去年冬天兴修水利时，新民生产队有一口“打鼓井”，井口小，水流得很小，扩大井口就能够解决一片田的干旱问题。但当时有少数社员不同意打开井口，他们说：开这口井花工多，不好搞。听到这种反映后，支部立即召开支部大会，组织学习《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》两篇文章。使大家认识到打开井口，引水灌田对促进农业生产的作用，并动员大家克服困难，夺取高产。党内统一认识后，又由党员分头去动员群众。党员陈朝达带领新民生产队的党员、干部和几个社员，先动手打炮开井口，才打进丈把深，水就比原来流得大了。水流进了田里后，党支部又组织社员群众参观，使群众受到了很大教育。
    在工作中，我也比较注意了解实际情况，向群众进行宣传，注意解决群众的困难。我们支部的党员莫开礼住在离大队十来里路的地方，过去，我不经常去他那里，对他住房条件差，身体有病的情况了解得少，关心也不够，只怪他工作、生产不够积极。后来，我读了毛泽东同志的著作。毛泽东同志说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”根据毛泽东同志的教导，我主动去找莫开礼谈心，帮助他解决困难。这样一来，莫开礼自己检查了过去不积极工作和没有带头搞生产的错误。以后他在工作和生产上都很积极。去年秋天，交送公粮，他的小孩生病死了，自己身体又不舒适，但是，他没有考虑个人，仍然积极带领群众交送公粮，使他所在的红岩生产队提前完成了任务。
    今后，我要更好地突出政治，让毛泽东思想在我们的一切工作中都挂起帅来。
