    Small Stories During the Overhaul
    Wugang No. 2 Blast Furnace Overhaul Project Headquarters Political Department
    The Story of Bumping and Leaking
    The temperature inside the blast furnace is very high. In order to reduce the damage of high temperature to the furnace body, a layer of cooling wall is installed between the furnace wall and the furnace bricks. The cooling wall is cast with pipes for circulating water to flow through, and the two ends of the pipes are exposed outside the cooling wall. Cold water is pressed in from the outside and circulates in the cooling wall, playing the role of cooling the furnace body. The Lu Yongchi scaffolding group of the Second Team is one of the groups responsible for installing this kind of cooling wall.
    Before installation, this group studied "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War": "Strategic problems are things that study the laws of the overall war." They applied the viewpoints of "one move" and "overall situation" to the construction of the cooling wall, which improved their consciousness of installation.
    From the function of the cooling wall, they associated it with the important significance of protecting the pipes and preventing water leakage, and realized that leak-proofing is the "decisive move" in the entire installation battle, and must be guaranteed to win completely. Otherwise, "if the cooling wall leaks (a defeat), no matter how well it is installed (continuous victories), it will not play a cooling role (all efforts are wasted)."
    How to prevent leakage? After discussion, everyone believed that for scaffolding workers, no bumping would guarantee no leakage. To prevent leakage, one must first prevent bumping; to prevent bumping, one must also prepare for being bumped, and prepare for the eventuality of being bumped. To this end, they broke down the entire installation process into four links: loading, transportation, dragging and hoisting into the furnace, and installing into the furnace body, and studied link by link how to prevent bumping, and what to do if it was bumped unfortunately, and how to reduce the consequences of the bumping.
    When loading, the pipe ends are easy to be damaged by bumping, so they cover the pipe ends with wood; when transporting, the pipe walls are easy to be crushed, so they lay the pipes flat one by one; when dragging and hoisting into the furnace, the rear side of the cooling wall is easy to be damaged by bumping, so they keep the rear side at a certain angle of inclination to weaken the impact when bumping, so that even if there is a bump, it will not leak... In short, they not only estimated the possibility of no bumping, but also estimated the possibility of being bumped; they not only made precautions against bumping, but also made preparations for being bumped. By improving their installation consciousness, they also grasped the initiative in installation. As a result, they "won every battle" and did not leak a single one, successfully completing the installation task.
    This matter tells people: the development of things depends not only on the internal contradictions of things themselves, but also on the restrictions and influences of other related things outside. Therefore, the development trend of things is not only one possibility, but multiple possibilities. With this kind of awareness, one can imagine several prospects, make several preparations, so as to enable oneself to grasp the initiative, be prepared, cope freely, and achieve the expected success. Is the Certificate of Conformity Qualified?
    There is a welding task with very high quality requirements in the blast furnace overhaul, that is, welding and repairing the furnace shell. In order to ensure the welding quality, a training class was specially held before the overhaul, and those who passed the examination were issued a certificate of conformity. When welding and repairing the furnace shell, one can go to the furnace with the certificate of conformity. Without the certificate of conformity, no matter how great the craftsman is, he is not allowed to operate on the furnace. This can be regarded as serious and strict enough. However, the welding quality is very poor. The First Team checked five welding holes, and two of them were unqualified. The certificate of conformity cannot guarantee the quality, what is the reason?
    Comrade Chen Chunxiang, the deputy instructor of the Second Section of the Second Team, who had studied in the training class and held a certificate of conformity, said: "Because the training class is not conducted according to the needs of actual combat... In the training class, the gaps at the welding places of the samples used for welding are less than four millimeters, and the welding seams are milled and then filed, and even sanded with sandpaper, so clean that they can reflect people's shadows. But in the blast furnace, the gaps at the welding places of the furnace shell are often as large as six or seven millimeters, and can only be polished with a grinding wheel, which is very rough. This is one. In the training class, people can manipulate the samples at will, and all adopt overhead welding, which is very convenient to operate; but in the blast furnace, people are restricted by the furnace wall and are forced to perform vertical welding, horizontal welding, etc., which is very awkward to operate. This is two. In the training class, the power switch is nearby, and the current can be adjusted at any time to maintain the uniformity of the weld; but in the blast furnace, adjusting the current requires running from the furnace to the bottom of the furnace, and often cannot be adjusted. This is three." He also said: "All these differences have not been resolved in this certificate of conformity." This shows that: the training is divorced from the needs of actual combat, and the training itself is unqualified. The certificate of conformity that proves that the training is qualified in this kind of training is of course also unqualified. But there are such people, they see the word "qualified" on the "book" and no longer investigate the original face of the things represented by the "book", as if with a certificate of conformity, everything has a qualified guarantee. As a result, they are deceived, and the more seriously they handle things according to the certificate of conformity, the more difficult it is to be qualified. From this, it can be seen that with a metaphysical point of view, only looking at the phenomenon, not the essence, good intentions may not necessarily lead to good results.
  Why Doesn't the Ring Beam Crane Turn?
    The bottom of the blast furnace needs to be built with two layers of high-temperature resistant carbon bricks. This kind of brick is very large, each piece is 3.2 meters long and weighs more than 800 kilograms. A special machine is needed for砌installation, this machine is called a ring beam crane. The crane consists of a central axis, a ring rail and a cantilever. The central axis is like the center of a circle, the ring rail is like the circumference, and the cantilever is like the radius. One end of the cantilever can move along the ring rail, and the other end can rotate 360 degrees around the central axis. The cantilever is equipped with an electric hoist that can move in parallel. In this way, the crane can carry out lifting operations at any point within the circular surface reached by the cantilever. Before building the furnace, the crane was specially pre-installed and pre-tested outside the furnace, and it ran normally for two whole afternoons. However, when the test run was officially installed in the furnace, an unexpected phenomenon occurred: it could barely turn on the first day, and it simply did not turn on the second day. What is the reason?
    Technician Comrade Chen Bojun said that, in retrospect, there were many factors that caused the non-rotation, including structural factors and installation factors, but the main one was the human ideological factor. The non-rotation of the machine was mainly caused by people's metaphysical viewpoint, which viewed problems as static and unchanging.
    He said that, although there is only one word difference between outside the furnace and inside the furnace, the installation conditions and equipment conditions have undergone great changes. First, the installation environment has changed. The outside of the furnace is an open-air operation, the installation conditions are good, and it is easy to correct deviations, while the inside of the furnace is an operation, the installation conditions are poor, and it is quite difficult to correct deviations. However, our installation technology remains at the level of installation outside the furnace, so new problems such as uneven ring rails and non-vertical central axes have emerged, which seriously affect the rotation of the ring arm. Second, the equipment conditions have also changed. For example, the bushing of the central axis (which is connected to the cantilever), was spot welded outside the furnace, and the deformation was very small. After being changed to full welding inside the furnace, the deformation of the bushing was very large, and an ovality of ten degrees appeared. In addition, the gap between the shaft and the bushing was originally designed to be too small, and there was no room for maneuver, so the shaft was held to death by the bushing. The cantilever also does not turn.
    In short, the crane can rotate outside the furnace because it has the conditions for rotation. Inside the furnace, the objective conditions have changed, and our understanding has not kept up with this change, and the installation level has not been able to adapt to this changed situation, so the ring beam crane is also stuck and does not turn. Later, adapting to the changes, the gap between the bushing and the shaft was increased, the ring rail was leveled, and the central axis was adjusted, and the crane started to rotate again. However, it delayed the construction period for two whole days.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Any process, whether it belongs to the natural world or to the social world... is moving forward and developing forward, and people's movement of knowledge should also follow this movement and development... The changes in the situation during the revolutionary period are very rapid. If the understanding of the revolutionaries cannot change rapidly with it, they cannot guide the revolution to victory." The installation conditions of the ring beam crane have changed, and people's understanding has not changed rapidly with it, so the ring beam crane does not turn; the understanding has changed, and the ring beam crane turns. Doesn't this well reflect the reaction of the spirit to matter, and reflect the dialectical relationship between matter and spirit?

    大修中的小故事
    武钢二号高炉大修工程指挥部政治处
    撞和漏的故事
    高炉炉内温度很高。为了减轻高温对炉体的破坏，人们在炉壁和炉砖之间安装了一层冷却壁。冷却壁中铸有供循环水流通的管道，管道两端露于冷却壁外。冷水从外界压入，在冷却壁内循环，起着冷却炉体的作用。二队芦永池架工小组就是负责安装这种冷却壁的小组之一。
    安装前，这个小组学习了《中国革命战争的战略问题》：“战略问题是研究战争全局的规律的东西”，把“一着”和“全盘”的观点用于冷却壁施工，提高了对安装的自觉性。
    他们由冷却壁的作用，联想到保护管道、防止管道漏水的重要意义，认识到防漏是整个安装战役中的“决定意义的一着”，必须确保全胜。否则，“冷却壁如果漏了（一个败仗），安装得再好（连战皆捷），也起不到冷却的作用（全功尽弃）”。
    怎样防止不漏呢？经过讨论，大家认为，对架工来说，不撞就能保证不漏。要防漏，必先防撞；要防撞，又要准备挨撞，作万一被撞的防备。为此，他们把安装的整个过程分解成装车、运输、向炉内拖吊和向炉体安装等四个环节，并逐个环节研究怎样防撞，不幸撞了，又该怎样减轻撞的后果。
    装车的时候易撞坏管头，他们就在管头周围遮上木头；运输的时候易压坏管壁，他们就把管子一个个地平装起来；向炉内拖吊的时候易撞坏冷却壁的后侧面，他们就令后侧面保持一定斜度，减弱碰撞时的冲击量，万一碰撞了一下，也不致漏……。总之，他们既估计了不撞的可能，也估计了挨撞的可能；既作了防撞的预防，也作了挨撞的准备。提高了安装自觉性，也就掌握了安装主动权。结果“连战皆捷”，一个没漏，顺利地完成了安装任务。
    这件事告诉人们：事物的发展不仅取决于事物自身内部的矛盾性，而且还受着外界其他有关事物的制约和影响。因此，事物的发展趋向就不仅只有一种可能，而有多种可能。有了这种认识上的自觉性，就能多设想几种前景，多作几手准备，从而使自己掌握主动权，处于有备无患、应付自如的境地，取得预期的成功。合格证合不合格？
    高炉大修中有项质量要求很高的焊接任务，这就是焊补炉皮。为了确保焊补质量，大修前专门举办了训练班，考试合格的发给合格证。焊补炉皮的时候凭合格证上炉，没有合格证，再大的工匠也不允许上炉操作。这样作算得是够认真、够严格了。可是，焊补质量却很差。一队抽查过五个焊补孔，质量不合格的就有两个。合格证不能保证质量的合格，原因在哪里呢？
    曾在训练班学习过、并持有合格证的二队二段代理指导员陈春祥同志说：“因为训练班不是按照实战需要进行训练的……在训练班的时候，焊接用的试样的焊接处的间隙都小于四毫米，焊口铣了再锉，锉了还用砂纸打，净得照见人影。可是在高炉，炉皮焊接处的间隙却常常大到六七个毫米，而且只能用砂轮打磨，非常粗糙，这是一。在训练班的时候，人们可以随意摆布试样，一律采用俯焊，操作起来很方便；可是在高炉，人们却被高炉炉壁所限制，被迫进行仰焊、卧焊等，操作非常别扭，这是二。在训练班时，电门就在身旁，可随时调整电流大小，保持焊缝均匀；可在高炉，调整电流要从炉上跑到炉下，常常欲调不能，这是三。”他又说：“所有这些的差别问题，在这个合格证里一个也没有得到解决。”这说明了：训练脱离了实战需要，训练本身就是不合格的。证明在这种训练中训练合格的合格证，当然也就不合格。可是却有这样的人，他们一看到“本本”上的合格字样就不再追查“本本”所代表的事物的本来面目，仿佛有了合格证，一切都有了合格的保证。结果受了骗，越认真地凭合格证办事，就越难合格。由此可见，带着形而上学的观点，只看现象，不看本质，好心不一定就能办出好事来。
  环梁吊车为什么不转了？
    高炉炉底要砌两层耐高温的炭砖。这种砖很大，每块长三米二，重八百多公斤，砌装时需要一种特殊的机械，这种机械名叫环梁吊车。吊车由中心轴、环轨和悬臂组成。中心轴象圆心，环轨象圆周，悬臂象半径。悬臂的一端可以沿环轨移动，另端可以绕中心轴作三百六十度的旋转。悬臂上附有可以平行移动的电葫芦。这样，吊车在悬臂所达的圆面内的任何一点上都能进行吊装作业。砌炉之前，吊车在炉外专门进行了预安装和预试车，整整两个下午运行都很正常。可是，在炉内正式安装后试车时，却出现了意想不到的现象：第一天还能勉强转动，第二天干脆一转也不转了。原因在哪里呢？
    技术员陈伯钧同志说，事后看来，引起不转的因素很多，有结构的因素，有安装的因素，但主要的还是人的思想因素。机械的不转主要是因为人的形而上学观点，看问题静止不变造成的。
    他说，炉外到炉内，虽然只差一个字，可是安装条件和设备条件却起了很大的变化。一是安装环境变了。炉外是露天作业，安装条件好，纠正偏差容易，而炉内作业，安装条件差，纠正偏差却相当困难。可我们的安装技术却停留在炉外安装的水平，所以就出了环轨不平、中心轴不垂直等新的问题，严重影响了环臂的转动。二是设备条件也起了变化。如中心轴的轴套（上面联接着悬臂），在炉外是点焊，变形很小，到了炉内后改为满焊，轴套变形很大，出现了十道的椭圆度，加上轴和套的间隙设计本来过小，没有缓和的余地，结果轴就被套抱死了。悬臂也就不转了。
    总之，吊车在炉外能转，是因为具备了转的条件。到炉内，客观条件起了变化，我们的认识却没有跟上这种变化，安装水平也没能适应这种变化了的情况，所以环梁吊车也就随之卡住了，不转了。后来以变应变，改大了套和轴的间隙，找平了环轨，调整了中心轴，吊车就重新转动起来。不过，却整整耽误了两天工期。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何过程，不论是属于自然界的和属于社会的……都是向前推移向前发展的，人们的认识运动也应跟着推移和发展……革命时期情况的变化是很急速的，如果革命党人的认识不能随之而急速变化，就不能引导革命走向胜利。”环梁吊车安装条件变了，人们的认识没能随之急速变化，环梁吊车就不转；认识变了，环梁吊车就转了。这不是很好地反映了精神对物质的反作用，反映了物质和精神的辩证关系吗？
