    Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the ideological guidance of giving prominence to politics and farming for the revolution, and encouraged by striving for a double harvest of grain and cotton in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, cadres and masses in rural areas across the country have high political enthusiasm. Most regions nationwide have basically completed this year's spring plowing and sowing plan with guaranteed quality and quantity. Currently, spring plowing and sowing are nearing completion. Rice transplanting is still ongoing in some areas in the south with later seasons, and spring sowing continues in the north, especially in some areas of the Northeast and Northwest.

    This year's spring agricultural production in various parts of the country has unfolded under the circumstances of studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, deeply carrying out socialist education, learning the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, and launching a movement to learn from, compare with, catch up with, help, and surpass each other.

    Giving prominence to politics to lead spring plowing, extensively studying Chairman Mao's works; taking class struggle as the key link, vigorously grasping political and ideological work, and vigorously grasping the revolutionization of people's thinking; political and ideological work in rural areas has been further strengthened, and people's mental outlook has changed, thereby promoting the spring agricultural production movement to rise wave after wave. This is the main characteristic of this year's spring agricultural production.

    During the period of preparation for plowing and spring plowing, the vast number of cadres in various places studied Chairman Mao's works and the heroic deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, further establishing a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. At the same time, extensive discussions on the relationship between politics and production, and the relationship between politics and professional work were held in various places, establishing the idea of using politics to command production and professional work. Based on ideological revolutionization, this year, the number of cadres going to the countryside with Chairman Mao's works and hoes, squatting at points, participating in labor, and going deep into the front lines of production to lead spring plowing has increased several times compared with previous years. From relevant central departments to leading cadres at all levels of the commune, especially county party secretaries and members, have generally been on the front line of spring plowing this year, studying and working together with the broad masses of commune members. In the three northeastern provinces alone, 23,000 cadres at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels went deep into the front lines. In Shandong Province, more than 40,000 cadres (including commune and team cadres) squatted at points. In Huaiyin and Yancheng prefectures in Jiangsu, more than 2,000 cadres at the prefectural and county levels squatted at points. Of the 197 county party secretaries, members, and ministers in Nanping Prefecture, Fujian, 177 squatted at points. They led spring plowing on the front line, not simply focusing on grasping measures and techniques, but first giving prominence to politics, mobilizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, and carrying out discussions on farming for the revolution. In other words, they first did the work of people, promoting the ideological revolutionization of people. Leading cadres at all levels paid attention to providing specific guidance to spring plowing production at several points, and using the experience of the points to promote the spring plowing production movement on the surface. In their specific guidance, they paid attention to promoting democracy, learning from the masses, and consulting with the masses; they paid attention to investigation and research, starting from reality to solve problems, thereby ensuring that the masses were full of enthusiasm, the leadership was calm-headed, and the spring plowing production movement developed healthily.

    Through extensively studying Chairman Mao's works and deeply carrying out socialist education, the class consciousness and the consciousness of farming for the revolution of the broad masses of commune members have become higher; the idea of emphasizing the spirit of self-reliance in production and striving to make more contributions to the country and the revolution has been more widely established. Regions with many years of good harvests have overcome complacency and continue to forge ahead; backward regions are also unwilling to lag behind and want to strive to quickly change the backward situation in production. Therefore, the quality of spring plowing production in most regions is generally better than in previous years. This spring, the natural conditions in many regions were not good. Some regions encountered spring droughts, and the phenomenon of rotten seedlings due to spring cold was quite serious in some areas south of the Yangtze River. In the face of difficulties caused by natural disasters, people armed with Mao Zedong Thought not only displayed a tenacious fighting spirit of resisting disasters and producing, but also creatively studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, thereby achieving victory in spring plowing and sowing. The victory of Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, in overcoming the difficulties caused by rotten seedlings due to spring cold and finally completing the transplanting of early rice is a victory of creatively studying and applying "On Contradiction."

    From last winter to this spring, rural areas across the country have universally launched a movement to learn from, compare with, catch up with, help, and surpass Dazhai. Encouraged by the spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance of Dazhai, the number of farmland water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring was generally more than in previous years. Many regions and communes and teams where grain and cotton production have continuously increased by large areas and large margins continue to move towards higher yields, and other regions have also put forward specific measures and strived to move towards the direction of high yields. Many regions that previously mainly relied on the state for the supply of chemical fertilizers have mainly relied on their own large-scale planting of green manure crops, large-scale accumulation of miscellaneous fertilizers, and raising pigs to accumulate manure to solve the fertilizer needed for spring agricultural production this year. Many regions that used to have difficulties in production and relied on the state to solve them this year first relied on themselves to solve them, thereby tapping their own production potential, especially tapping their own labor potential. The advanced production technology of Dazhai-style units in various places has been promoted more widely through the method of "inviting in and sending out." Every production brigade in Guangdong Province has invited experienced Chaoshan old farmers who are skilled in growing rice. There are also more cases of inviting old farmers from advanced units to pass on their skills in the Yangtze River basin and in the north.

    At present, the sowing of cotton has been completed nationwide, and the quality is better than last year; the transplanting of early rice in the south has also basically ended, and the area of early rice transplanting is more than 10 million mu more than last year. More green manure, more improved varieties, denser planting, and faster greening are the characteristics of this year, laying the foundation for a bumper agricultural harvest in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. Due to insufficient rainfall and low temperatures in some areas this year, the spring sowing season has been prolonged. These regions must continue to work hard, give prominence to politics, and complete spring sowing. Those that have already completed spring sowing should step up inspection to ensure full seedlings and strengthen field management to strive for a bumper harvest.

### 高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗为革命种田  全国农村保质保量进行春耕春播

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗为革命种田  全国农村保质保量进行春耕春播
    新华社二十四日讯　全国农村高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在突出政治、为革命种田的思想指导下，在争取第三个五年计划第一年粮棉双丰收的鼓舞下，干部和群众政治热情高涨，全国大部分地区保质保量地基本上完成了今年的春耕春播计划。现在，春耕和春播已经接近尾声，南方部分季节较晚的地区还在继续插秧，北方特别是东北和西北部分地区还在继续春播。
    今年全国各地的春耕生产，是在大学毛主席著作，深入开展社会主义教育，学习大寨革命精神、开展比学赶帮超运动的情况下展开的。
    突出政治领导春耕，大学毛主席著作；以阶级斗争为纲，大抓政治思想工作，大抓人的思想革命化；农村政治思想工作进一步加强，人的精神面貌发生了变化，从而促使春耕生产运动一浪高过一浪，不少地区春耕春播完成得又快又好。这是今年春耕生产的主要特点。
    备耕和春耕期间，各地广大干部学习毛主席的著作，学习焦裕禄同志英雄事迹，进一步树立了为人民服务的革命人生观。与此同时，各地普遍进行了政治与生产的关系、政治与业务的关系的大讨论。树立了以政治统帅生产、统帅业务的思想。在思想革命化的基础上，今年带着毛主席著作，带着锄头下乡蹲点，参加劳动，深入生产第一线领导春耕的干部，比往年增加了几倍。从中央有关部门到公社各级领导干部，特别是县委书记和委员，今年普遍都在春耕第一线上，同广大社员一起学习，一起劳动。东北三省仅省、地、县三级深入第一线的干部就达二万三千人，山东一省有四万多干部
  （包括社队干部）蹲点，江苏淮阴、盐城两专区有专、县两级两千多干部蹲点，福建南平专区的县委书记、委员和部长一百九十七人中有一百七十七人蹲点。他们在第一线领导春耕，不是单纯地抓措施、抓技术，而是首先突出政治，发动群众学习毛主席著作，开展为革命种田的讨论。也就是说，他们首先是做人的工作，促进人的思想革命化。各级领导干部都注意对若干点的春耕生产进行具体指导，并运用点的经验推动面上的春耕生产运动。他们在具体指导中注意了发扬民主，向群众学习和同群众商量；注意了调查研究从实际出发解决问题，从而保证了群众热情饱满，领导头脑冷静，春耕生产运动健康地向前发展。
    大学毛主席著作和深入开展社会主义教育，广大社员的阶级觉悟和为革命种田的觉悟更高了；在生产上强调发扬自力更生精神，争取为国家、为革命多作贡献的思想，已经较普遍树立起来。多年丰收的地区克服了自满的思想，继续奋力前进；落后地区也不甘落后，要争取迅速改变生产上的落后面貌，因而大部分地区春耕生产质量普遍比往年好。今年春季，不少地区的自然条件并不好，有的地区遇到了春旱，长江以南部分地区春寒烂秧现象相当严重。在自然灾害造成的困难面前，以毛泽东思想武装起来了的人们，不仅发扬了顽强的抗灾生产的战斗精神，而且还活学活用毛泽东思想，从而取得了春耕和春播的胜利。江西省宜春县克服春寒烂秧造成的困难，终于完成早稻插秧工作，就是活学活用《矛盾论》的胜利。
    从去冬到今春，全国农村普遍开展了学大寨、赶大寨的比学赶帮超运动。在大寨的艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神鼓舞下，去冬今春各地兴修的农田水利基本建设普遍比往年多。许多粮食棉花大面积、大幅度连续增产的地区和社队，继续向高产再高产前进，其他地区也都提出了具体措施，奋力向高产的方向前进。许多过去主要依靠国家供应化肥的地区，今年春耕生产需要的肥料，主要靠自己大种绿肥作物、大积杂肥和养猪积肥来解决的。许多过去生产上有困难依靠国家解决的地区，今年都首先依靠自己解决，从而发掘了自己的生产潜力，首先是发掘了自己的劳动潜力。各地大寨式单位的先进生产技术用“请进来派出去”的方式推得更广了。广东全省每一个生产大队都请了精于种水稻的潮汕老农。在长江流域、在北方请先进单位老农传艺的也更多了。
    现在，全国棉花播种已经完成，质量比去年好；南方早稻插秧也基本上结束了，早稻插秧面积比去年多一千多万亩，绿肥多、良种多、插得密、返青快是今年的特点，为第三个五年计划第一年的农业丰收打下了基础。由于今年有些地区雨水不足，有的气温偏低，从而拖长了春播季节。这些地区须继续努力，突出政治，完成春播。已经春播的要加紧检查，保证全苗，并加强田间管理工作，争取丰收。
