    See Whose Tool the "Beijing Daily" Has Become
    Beijing Normal University Education Department "Yanshan Yuhua" Criticism Group
    Since the beginning of the criticism of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, the "Beijing Daily" has maintained some contact with us. Through a series of interactions, we have become increasingly clear that the "Beijing Daily" is not a proletarian ideological position, but a bourgeois anti-Party and anti-socialist fortress.

  Suppressing articles criticizing Wu Han,
  Praising and shielding articles by Wu Han

    After Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article was published, the "Beijing Daily" contacted us, saying that we were involved in education and hoped we could write articles on the issue of moral inheritance. At the time, we were very angry at Wu Han's reversal of the right-leaning opportunists and his rampant attacks on the Party, and we wrote several articles. Although most of them focused on moral issues, we still criticized Wu Han politically. After these articles were sent to the "Beijing Daily," the "Beijing Daily" refused to publish them, saying that we were "too simplistic." Not long after, one day the "Beijing Daily" notified us that it was going to publish an "important article" tomorrow. Therefore, the next day we bought a large number of newspapers, ready to study them seriously. But when we looked at it, it turned out to be that notorious article written by Xiang Yangsheng (i.e., Deng Tuo), "From 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' to 'Moral Inheritance Theory'." At that time, we were unable to see through the conspiracy of Deng Tuo and his ilk and the "Beijing Daily." However, this article avoided political issues and attributed Wu Han's rampant attacks to what "moral inheritance theory" was. We had strong opinions and wanted to write an article to refute it. Later, we saw that this was Deng Tuo's attempt to exonerate Wu Han and protect his own big poisonous weed, and then we realized that the "Beijing Daily" telling us that this was an important article had extremely malicious intentions, that is, to make us follow Deng Tuo, write a lot about the "moral criticism inheritance" issue, and cooperate with them to reverse the direction of the struggle.

      Opposing the political criticism of Wu Han
          Coming up with a bunch of boring topics

    After that, the "Beijing Daily" successively issued many article titles related to moral issues, hoping that we would write articles. What topics did they come up with? Here is a part for everyone to enjoy:

    What is the difference between feudal filial piety and supporting parents?

    Is the saying "Parents are alive, don't travel far" correct?

    Is it "unfilial" to give parents advice?

    Is the saying "Teacher and apprentice are like father and son" correct?

    What is the difference between "mutual assistance between comrades" and "gang loyalty"?

    Is "reporting the situation to the leadership" "betraying friends"?

    How to analyze "loyalty" in "Water Margin"?

    Enough! Is this repelling Wu Han's rampant anti-Party and anti-socialist attacks? Of course not. Here, the "Beijing Daily" turns political struggle and class struggle into academic discussions, and then turns academic discussions into discussions of general ideological issues, attempting to use this method of "gradual degradation" to cover up the enemy's attacks, divert the masses' attention, and want us to lay down our weapons and give up the struggle. Even more insidious is that, under the pretext of eliminating the so-called influence of feudal morality on the people, they cleverly turned the spearhead against anti-Party and anti-socialist elements towards the people.

    At that time, although we felt that these things were not quite right, our critical struggle was somewhat affected because we had not been able to figure out this vicious conspiracy for a while.

  Taking various measures to obstruct the criticism of Wu Han

    Under the leadership and education of the Party, with the deepening of the struggle, we gradually realized that the result of the "Beijing Daily" doing this was to let the enemy go and disrupt the front. Therefore, we wrote some articles criticizing Wu Han politically and sent them to the "Beijing Daily." The "Beijing Daily" also suppressed them and did not publish them. For example, one of them, "Who Does Wu Han Throw His 'Dagger' At," was written before the "People's Daily" published Wu Han's reactionary historical materials before liberation. The content of the article was to expose Wu Han's anti-communist and anti-people essence before liberation, focusing on exposing that Wu Han's publication of "Throwing Daggers" in 1959 was an anti-Party and anti-socialist "dagger." The "Beijing Daily" suppressed the manuscript for several days, saying that they "had not seen it," but after the "People's Daily" announced Wu Han's reactionary historical materials before liberation, they told us that they were not going to use it, because the "People's Daily" had already exposed these materials. This kind of processing seems to be impeccable, but it is not actually. Just two or three days after they said this, the "Beijing Daily" published an article entitled "Wu Han Did Anti-Communist and Anti-People Deeds in the 1940s." This exposed the "Beijing Daily" editorial department's trick, because since they were focusing on the point of "materials," then the "People's Daily"'s materials did not reveal too little of Wu Han's reactionary history in the 1940s. From the perspective of materials, the above article basically did not exceed much. Why did they publish articles of the same nature? This can only prove that under the pressure of the situation, the "Beijing Daily" was only willing to publish some materials exposing Wu Han that had been published in other newspapers, and was afraid to publish new materials exposing Wu Han.

    At this time, we also had a further understanding of Xiang Yangsheng's attack. Therefore, we called the "Beijing Daily" and told them that we wanted to write an article criticizing Xiang Yangsheng. The "Beijing Daily" openly opposed us writing this article. They said: "Haven't we already published an article criticizing Xiang Yangsheng today?" Publicly obstructing us from writing an article criticizing Deng Tuo. Look: To what extent has the "Beijing Daily" gone crazy?

    We are warning the "Beijing Daily" that your reactionary attempt will not succeed, you must hand over your black hearts of colluding with Deng Tuo and others and surrender to the people honestly. You cannot get away with it.

    请看《北京日报》成了谁的工具
    北京师范大学教育系《燕山夜话》批判小组
    《北京日报》在批判吴晗反党反社会主义罪行开始以后，和我们保持一些联系。通过一系列来往，我们越来越明确地认识到《北京日报》不是无产阶级思想阵地，而是资产阶级反党反社会主义的堡垒。扣压批判吴晗的文章，
  吹捧包庇吴晗的文章
    姚文元同志文章发表后，《北京日报》和我们联系，说我们是搞教育的，希望我们写道德继承问题的稿子。当时，我们对吴晗为右倾机会主义分子翻案、猖狂向党进攻十分愤怒，写了几篇文章。虽然大部分偏重于道德问题，但我们还是从政治上批判吴晗的。这些文章送到《北京日报》之后，《北京日报》不予发表，说我们“太简单化”。事隔不久，一天《北京日报》通知我们，明天要发表一篇“重要文章”。因此第二天我们买了一大批报纸，准备认真学习。可是一看，原来就是那篇臭名昭著的向阳生（即邓拓）写的《从〈海瑞罢官〉谈到“道德继承论”》。当时，我们没有能识透邓拓之流及《北京日报》的阴谋。但是，这篇文章回避政治问题，把吴晗的猖狂进攻归结为什么“道德继承论”，我们很有意见，想写文章反驳。后来，我们看清了这是邓拓为吴晗开脱、保护自己的大毒草，才知道《北京日报》告诉我们这是一篇重要文章是有极为恶毒的用心的，就是要我们跟着邓拓跑，大写什么“道德批判继承”问题，配合他们扭转斗争方向。
      反对从政治上批判吴晗
          出了一大堆无聊的选题
    以后，《北京日报》又陆续发出了许多有关道德问题的批判文章题目，希望我们写稿。他们出了一些什么题目呢？摘录一部分供大家欣赏：
    封建孝道与瞻养父母有什么区别？
    “父母在不远游”这种说法对不对？
    对父母提意见就是“不孝”吗？
    “师徒如父子”这种说法对不对？
    “同志间互相帮助”和“哥儿们讲义气”有什么区别？
    “向领导汇报情况”是“出卖朋友”吗？
    怎样分析《水浒传》中的“讲义气”？
    够了！这是打退吴晗反党反社会主义的猖狂进攻吗？当然不是。《北京日报》在这里把政治斗争、阶级斗争化为学术讨论，再把学术讨论化为一般思想问题的讨论，企图用这种“逐步降级”的手法，掩护阶级敌人的进攻，转移群众视线，要我们放下武器，放弃斗争。更恶毒的还是，他们借口肃清所谓封建道德对人民群众的影响，要把针对反党反社会主义分子的矛头，巧妙地转向对人民开火。
    当时，我们虽然感到这些东西不大对头，但是由于我们一时尚未能弄清这种恶毒阴谋，所以我们的批判斗争也受到一些影响。
  采取种种手法，阻挠对吴晗的批判
    在党的领导和教育下，随着斗争的深入发展，我们逐渐认识到《北京日报》这样做的结果是放走了敌人，搅乱了阵线。于是，我们又写了一些从政治上批判吴晗的文章送到《北京日报》。《北京日报》又同样压下不发。例如，其中有一篇《吴晗向谁“投枪”》，写成于《人民日报》发表吴晗解放前反动历史材料之前。文章的内容是揭露吴晗解放前反共反人民的本质，着重揭露吴晗在一九五九年出版《投枪集》是反党反社会主义的“枪”。《北京日报》把稿件压了好几天，说“没有看见”，而在《人民日报》公布吴晗解放前反动历史材料之后，却告诉我们不准备用了，因为《人民日报》已经揭露了这些材料。这样处理好象是无可非议，实际不然。就在他们说这种话的后两三天，《北京日报》发表了《四十年代吴晗干的是反共反人民的勾当》一文。这正暴露了《北京日报》编辑部的马脚，因为既然他们是从“材料”的观点着眼，那么《人民日报》的材料对吴晗四十年代的反动历史揭的不为不多，上述文章从材料上看基本上没有超出多少，他们为什么还要发表同类性质的文章？这只能证明《北京日报》在形势的逼迫下，也只愿发表一些别的报纸发表过的揭露吴晗的材料，而害怕发表揭露吴晗的新的材料。
    这时，我们对向阳生的进攻，也有了进一步的认识。因此，我们打电话告诉《北京日报》，我们要写批判向阳生的文章。《北京日报》公然反对我们写这篇文章。他们说：“我们今天不是已经发表了批判向阳生的文章了吗？”公开阻挠我们写批判邓拓的文章。请看：《北京日报》已经猖狂到了什么程度？
    我们正告《北京日报》，你们的反动企图是不会得逞的，你们必须交出你们与邓拓等人勾勾搭搭、狼狈为奸的黑心，老老实实向人民缴械，滑是滑不过去的。
