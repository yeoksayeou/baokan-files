    Against Class Enemies, We Must Use Unconventional Tactics
    Deng Tuo Wants to Sow Discord Between the Party and the Masses; We Will Never Forgive Him.

    After reading Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk, I felt a surge of anger and could no longer restrain myself. I want to resolutely refute Deng Tuo and his gang's vicious slander against our Party and smash their frenzied attacks.
    Deng Tuo attacks our Party for "looking down on the masses" and "not accepting good suggestions from the masses below." This is complete nonsense. I want to ask Deng Tuo: What kind of people are you referring to as the masses? The Party has always relied on the people, who account for more than 95 percent of the national population, and humbly accepts their opinions. Our revolution was for the people, and we have always relied on the masses. Whether it was overthrowing the three great enemies in the past or carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction today, every achievement has been achieved by relying on the masses. It is precisely because the Party relies on the masses the most, serves them wholeheartedly, that the masses support the Party the most, love Chairman Mao the most, and wholeheartedly dedicate their strength to the revolutionary cause. I am the daughter of a poor peasant, and the Party rescued me from the sea of ​​suffering. Now I am an employee on the commercial front and have become a member of the Shanxi Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, participating in the management of national affairs. The Party cares for me and cultivates me in every possible way, giving full play to my strength. I see clearly that the Party is seeking benefits for us working people, so I resolutely listen to the Party's teachings and serve the people in the mountainous areas wholeheartedly. Deng Tuo, you want to sow discord between the Party and the masses; we will never forgive you.
    Deng Tuo said that our Party "looks down on the masses" and does not listen to their "good opinions." What kind of masses are you referring to? They are the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have been overthrown, the right-leaning opportunists who have been removed from office, and all the monsters and demons. The "good opinions" you are talking about are the anti-Communist and anti-people poisonous gas bombs of these monsters and demons. Deng Tuo, you're right. You, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, are our enemies, the targets of dictatorship. How can we listen to your words? It is precisely because we do not listen to your nonsense that the people have today; if we had listened to your words, you would be happy, but the people would suffer. We will not only not listen to your words, but we will resolutely oppose them!
    Deng Tuo also scolds our Party for "always wanting to come up with its own ideas in everything, attempting to gain surprise victories." This is also true. The people's world, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao speak on behalf of the people's interests. The people's affairs should be decided by the people themselves, by the Party and Chairman Mao. What's wrong with that? Should we let you filial sons and virtuous grandsons of the feudal bourgeoisie, the accomplices of imperialism, and the partners of revisionism come up with ideas? This is wishful thinking and will never happen! You say that we "gain surprise victories." We have always been like this against class enemies, and now we will fight against you in the same way, not allowing you demons and monsters to stir up trouble. This is a great good thing for the revolutionary people. All enemies are afraid of us doing this. You are also afraid of us doing this. The more afraid you are, the more it proves that we are doing the right thing.
    Deng Tuo said that if we "do not correct this shortcoming, we will eventually suffer a great loss one day." We want to say to Deng Tuo, if we change according to your words, then we will really suffer a great loss. Chairman Mao taught us that for class enemies, "they are only allowed to behave themselves and not allowed to talk or act wildly." This must never be changed. Deng Tuo, your black talk has further raised our vigilance against class struggle. We must resolutely smash your frenzied attacks and defend the socialist state!

    对阶级敌人就要出奇制胜
    邓拓想挑拨离间党和群众的血肉关系，我们是决不会饶恕他的。
    山西省襄汾县邓庄供销社　张桂枝
    我看了邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话，心里憋着一股怒气，再也忍耐不住。我要坚决驳斥邓拓一伙对我们党的恶毒污蔑，打垮他们的猖狂进攻。
    邓拓攻击我们党“看不起群众”，“不接受下面群众的好意见”。这完全是胡说。我要质问邓拓：你所指的群众是什么样的人？党对占全国人口百分之九十五以上的人民群众是一贯依靠的，虚心接受群众意见的。我们闹革命，就是为了人民群众，从来就是依靠群众的。我们过去打倒三大敌人，今天进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，那一宗、那一件工作所取得的成绩都是依靠群众得来的。正因为党最依靠群众，全心全意地为群众办事，群众也就最拥护党，最热爱毛主席，真心实意地把力量献给革命事业。我是贫农的女儿，党从火海中把我拯救出来。现在我是商业战线上的职工，当上了山西省政协委员，参与管理国家大事。党无微不至地关怀我、培养我，充分发挥我的力量。我清清楚楚地看到党是为我们劳动人民谋福利的，所以我坚决听党的教导，全心全意为山区人民服务。邓拓，你想挑拨党和群众的血肉关系，我们是决不会饶恕你的。
    邓拓说我们党“看不起群众”，不听他们的“好意见”。你所指的是什么群众呢？就是被打倒了的地富反坏右，被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子和一切牛鬼蛇神。你所说的“好意见”，就是这些牛鬼蛇神反共反人民的毒气弹。邓拓，你算说对了。你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，是我们的敌人，是专政的对象。你们的话，我们怎么能听呢？正因为我们不听你们的鬼话，人民才有今天；假如听了你们的话，你们高兴了，可是人民就糟了。你们的话，我们不但不听，而且要坚决反对！
    邓拓又骂我们党“不管什么事情总是要自己出主意，企图出奇制胜”。这话也说对了。人民的天下，共产党和毛主席是代表人民利益说话的。人民的事情，就是要由人民自己出主意，由党和毛主席出主意。这有什么不好呢？难道让你们这些封建资产阶级的孝子贤孙、帝国主义的帮凶、修正主义的伙伴来出主意吗？这是白日做梦，万万办不到！你们说我们“出奇制胜”，我们对阶级敌人从来就是这样，现在对你们进行斗争，也要出这个奇制这个胜，不准你们这些妖魔鬼怪兴风作浪。这对革命人民来说，是大好事。一切敌人都害怕我们这样做。你们也害怕我们这样做。你们越害怕，越证明我们做对了。
    邓拓说我们如果“不改正这种毛病，终久会有一天要吃大亏”。我们要对邓拓说，假如我们按你的话来改了，那才真正要吃大亏。毛主席教导我们，对于阶级敌人，“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动”。这一条是永远不能改的。邓拓，你的黑话，更提高了我们对阶级斗争的警惕性，我们要坚决打垮你们的猖狂进攻，保卫社会主义的江山！
