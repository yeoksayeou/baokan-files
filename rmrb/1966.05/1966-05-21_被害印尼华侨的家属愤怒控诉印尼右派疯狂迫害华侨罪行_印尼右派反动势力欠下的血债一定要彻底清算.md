    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: Families of some victimized Overseas Chinese in Indonesia who are now in China, and recently returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia, have recently angrily denounced the fascist crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their frenzied persecution of Overseas Chinese. They unanimously pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing military clique is the mastermind behind this anti-Chinese atrocities, and the Indonesian government must immediately stop the cruel persecution of Overseas Chinese and effectively ensure the safety of the lives and property of the vast number of Overseas Chinese.
    Li Cunhan, an Indonesian returnee and worker at the Guangzhou Shunchang Factory, said: "The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces carried out inhumane killings of Overseas Chinese on Lombok Island, and even the elderly, weak, women, and children were not spared. My mother, Zhang Yuping, was had her ears and fingers cut off by thugs, her earrings and rings were stolen, and then she was thrown into the river to drown!" He said: "My mother was already sixty-two years old and was an ordinary housewife. She usually got along well with the local people, but she never expected to be killed by Indonesian right-wing thugs. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces must be thoroughly settled by us."
    On the night of November 15th last year, a group of thugs in Solo City, Indonesia, broke into the home of Overseas Chinese Lin Chunguang and kidnapped Lin Chunguang and his son Lin Renhe, taking them to a nearby field where they were killed with random knives. Lin Quan Song, the eighty-two-year-old mother-in-law of Lin Chunguang in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, tearfully denounced: "My son-in-law Lin Chunguang was a sixty-four-year-old man, and my grandson Lin Renhe was still a young man in school. They were actually murdered. I want to denounce the crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries to the people of the world!"
    Xie Wenjiao, the secretary of the Chinese General Association of Malang County, Indonesia, who was assassinated by Indonesian right-wing thugs, has his mother, daughter, and younger brother in China. His sixty-eight-year-old mother, Yang Xiangmei, was grief-stricken after learning from the newspaper that her beloved son had been brutally murdered by the Indonesian right-wing. She sobbed that her son had lived in Indonesia for more than twenty years and was as close as brothers and sisters with the Indonesian people. Now he has been brutally murdered, and the heinous crimes committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces must be repaid. Xie Jian, Xie Wenjiao's younger brother, said: "When Mount Agung in Bali erupted in 1962 and when a major flood occurred in East Java in 1963, my brother spared no effort to raise donations, funds, and materials to help the disaster-stricken Indonesian people overcome the disaster and establish their livelihoods. In 1963, when Brawijaya University was built in Malang, he and other local Overseas Chinese also helped to fund the construction of the school buildings. The local Indonesian people had a very good friendship with him. Now that he has been murdered by Indonesian right-wing thugs, this has not only aroused the indignation of the Chinese people but is also resolutely opposed by the Indonesian people."
    Huang Yinfa, an Indonesian returnee who works as a foreign language teacher in Nanning, denounced that his cousin Hong Chengcai was killed by right-wing thugs in an anti-Chinese atrocity in Meme County on January 12th this year, and neighbors Wu Shanyi and Huang Disheng were seriously stabbed by thugs. He said that this anti-Chinese atrocity occurred with the direct participation of Indonesian right-wing military personnel. His parents and younger sister were also unjustly imprisoned by the Indonesian right-wing authorities for forty days. When they were released home, their belongings had been looted by right-wing thugs. Huang Yinfa said that he had lived in Meme for many years and only returned to the motherland in 1960. He knew that the local Overseas Chinese had close friendships with the Indonesian people. This anti-Chinese atrocity was entirely manufactured by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary authorities, and the Indonesian right-wing reactionary authorities cannot escape its guilt.
    The families of the victimized Overseas Chinese pointed out that the brutal killings of their relatives were entirely the responsibility of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, and that the vast number of Indonesian people shared weal and woe and got along with the Overseas Chinese in a friendly manner. Zhang Tinghong, an Indonesian returnee and member of the Guangdong Jiaoling Overseas Chinese Farm, said that one of his relatives was stabbed in the back with a dagger by thugs in a certain place in Sulawesi, and the dagger deeply penetrated his back. After his relative was injured, he was hidden in the home of a local Indonesian resident and later sent to the hospital for treatment, thus narrowly escaping death. A recently returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia said that in a certain place in Bali, poor Indonesian farmers saw that many Overseas Chinese were persecuted and lost their livelihoods, so they risked their lives to send the rice they had saved. They said to the victimized Overseas Chinese: We have always been friendly to each other, and now that you are in trouble, we must do our best to help you! Tang Guangxin, an Indonesian returnee student in the Physics Department of Jinan University, said: "My father and uncle ran a grocery store and always got along well with the local people. When their store was destroyed by thugs and my cousins were brutally killed by thugs, Indonesian friends came to express their condolences and expressed their grief over their persecution by the right-wing reactionary forces. These Indonesian friends said angrily that a small group of Indonesian national scum violated the true wishes of the Indonesian people and destroyed the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people. We will eventually settle accounts with them one day."

    被害印尼华侨的家属愤怒控诉印尼右派疯狂迫害华侨罪行
    印尼右派反动势力欠下的血债一定要彻底清算
    新华社二十日讯  印度尼西亚一些受害华侨在国内的家属和新近归国的印度尼西亚华侨，最近愤怒控诉印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨的法西斯罪行。他们一致指出，印度尼西亚右派军人集团是这次排华暴行的策划者，印度尼西亚政府必须立即停止对华侨的残酷迫害，切实保障广大华侨生命财产的安全。
    印度尼西亚归侨、广州顺昌工厂工人李存汉说：“印度尼西亚右派反动势力在龙目岛对华侨进行惨无人道的杀害，连老弱妇孺也难以幸免。我的母亲张玉萍就被暴徒割掉耳朵和手指，抢去她的耳环和戒指，然后又将她抛入河中淹死！”他说：“我的母亲已经六十二岁，是个普通的家庭妇女，平时和当地人民友好相处，没料到竟然遭到印度尼西亚右派暴徒的杀害。印度尼西亚右派反动势力欠下的血债，我们一定要彻底清算。”
    去年十一月十五日深夜，印度尼西亚梭罗市的一群暴徒破门进入华侨林春光的家，把林春光和他的儿子林仁和绑架到附近草场用乱刀杀害。林春光在福建省福清县的八十二岁的老岳母林全宋流着眼泪控诉说：“我的女婿林春光是个六十四岁的老人，我的外孙林仁和还是个正在求学的青年，他们竟然遭到毒手，我要向全世界人民控诉印度尼西亚反动派的罪行！”
    被印度尼西亚右派暴徒刺杀的印度尼西亚玛琅县中华总会秘书谢文蛟，他的母亲、女儿和弟弟都在国内。他的六十八岁的母亲杨响妹从报纸上知道爱子惨遭印度尼西亚右派杀害的噩耗后，悲痛欲绝。她哭诉说，她的儿子侨居印度尼西亚已有二十多年，和印度尼西亚人民情同手足，现在竟然惨遭杀害，印度尼西亚右派反动势力犯下的滔天大罪是一定要偿还的。谢文蛟的弟弟谢坚说：“我哥哥在一九六二年巴厘岛阿贡火山爆发、一九六三年东爪哇发生大水灾时，都不遗余力地募捐款项、物资，帮助受灾的印度尼西亚人民度灾立业。一九六三年玛琅兴建卜拉威查雅大学，他也和当地华侨一起资助兴建校舍。当地的印度尼西亚人民同他有着很好的友谊。现在，印度尼西亚的右派暴徒杀害了他，这不仅激起了中国人民的愤慨，也是印度尼西亚人民所坚决反对的。”
    在南宁市担任外语教师的印度尼西亚归侨黄印发控诉说，他的表弟洪承才今年一月十二日在美玛县的一次排华暴行中被右派暴徒杀害，邻居吴善义、黄迪信被暴徒刺成重伤。他说，这次排华暴行是在印度尼西亚右派军人的直接参与下发生的，他的父母和妹妹还被印度尼西亚右派当局无辜关进监牢四十天，他们被释放回家时，家里的东西已被右派暴徒洗劫一空。黄印发说，他在美玛居住多年，一九六○年才返回祖国，深知当地华侨同印度尼西亚人民之间有着亲密的友谊。这次排华暴行，完全是印度尼西亚右派反动当局一手制造出来的，印度尼西亚右派反动当局逃不脱它的罪责。
    受害华侨的家属们指出，他们的亲人惨遭杀害，完全是印度尼西亚右派反动势力的责任，广大印度尼西亚人民是和华侨患难与共、友好相处的。印度尼西亚归侨、广东蕉岭华侨农场场员张汀鸿说，他的一个亲戚在苏拉威西某地被暴徒用匕首从背后猛刺，匕首深深地插入背部。他的这个亲戚受伤后被当地的印度尼西亚居民藏在家里，后来又被送到医院治疗，才幸免于死。一个新近回国的印度尼西亚华侨说，在巴厘岛某地，贫苦的印度尼西亚农民看到许多华侨遭到迫害丧失生计，就冒着生命危险送去了自己节省下来的大米。他们对受害华侨说：我们之间向来是友好相处的，现在你们有了困难，我们要尽力帮助！暨南大学物理系二年级印度尼西亚归侨学生汤光馨说：“我的父亲和堂伯父开设杂货店，一向与当地人民友好相处。当他们的商店遭到暴徒破坏，我的堂兄弟惨死在暴徒刀下时，印度尼西亚朋友们都前去慰问，对他们遭到右派反动势力的迫害表示很痛心。这些印度尼西亚朋友愤怒地说，一小撮印度尼西亚民族败类违背了印度尼西亚人民的真正愿望，破坏了中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的传统友谊。我们终有和他们清算的一天。”
