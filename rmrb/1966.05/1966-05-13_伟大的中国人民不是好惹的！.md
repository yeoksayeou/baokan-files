    Five American fighter planes intruded into the airspace over our Yunnan region on May 12, launching a surprise attack and shooting down our training aircraft. This blatant act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism against our country has aroused strong indignation among the Chinese people. We strongly condemn the monstrous crimes of U.S. imperialism.
    The spokesman of our Ministry of National Defense lodged the strongest protest against the war provocation by U.S. imperialism. The spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense pointed out: "The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have long been prepared for the U.S. imperialists' deliberate plot to expand the war of aggression. The blood debts owed by U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people must be repaid." The statement by the spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense expresses the firm will of our 650 million people. U.S. imperialism must understand: The great Chinese people are not to be trifled with!
    The fact that American planes are coming in droves and penetrating deep into our mainland region is, of course, not accidental. People clearly see that U.S. imperialism is shifting its strategic focus from Europe to the Far East. U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is constantly escalating. It continues to send troops to South Vietnam, and the number of U.S. invading troops has reached more than 250,000. It has dispatched B-52 bombers to North Vietnam, expanding the scope of the bombing. In the past half-month, U.S. officials have repeatedly clamored that there are "no sanctuaries" in the war of aggression against Vietnam. Everyone knows what U.S. imperialism means by "no sanctuaries." This means that American aerial bandits will even more rampantly violate our country's airspace. The deliberate provocation of May 12 fully proves this. This cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the Chinese people.
    On April 10, Premier Zhou Enlai clearly and unambiguously spoke four sentences about China's policy towards the United States to the reporter of the Pakistani newspaper *Dawn*. The U.S. government should keep these firmly in mind.
    We solemnly warn the U.S. government: Your war provocations cannot intimidate the Chinese people. The Chinese people mean what they say. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will definitely accompany you to the end, and will definitely make the American aggressors come in but not be able to get out, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the American aggressors!

### 伟大的中国人民不是好惹的！

    伟大的中国人民不是好惹的！
    五月十二日，美国战斗机五架，侵入我云南地区上空，进行突然袭击，击落我训练飞行的飞机。美帝国主义对我国的这一明目张胆的战争挑衅，激起中国人民强烈的愤怒，我们严厉谴责美帝国主义的滔天罪行。
    我国国防部发言人对美帝国主义的战争挑衅，提出最强烈的抗议。国防部发言人指出：“对于美帝国主义蓄意扩大侵略战争的阴谋计划，中国人民和中国人民解放军是早有准备的。美帝国主义欠下中国人民的血债是一定要偿还的。”国防部发言人的谈话，表达了我国六亿五千万人民的坚强意志。美帝国主义必须懂得：伟大的中国人民不是好惹的！
    美国飞机成群结队地这样深入我国大陆地区，当然不是偶然的。人们清楚地看到，美帝国主义正在把它的战略重点从欧洲移向远东。美帝国主义对越南的侵略，正在不断地升级。它向越南南方继续增兵，美国侵略军已达到二十五万多人。它对越南北方出动了B—52型轰炸机，扩大轰炸的范围。最近半个月来，美国官方一再叫嚷什么在侵越战争中“是没有庇护所的”。谁都知道美帝国主义的所谓“没有庇护所”是什么含义。这就是说，美国空中强盗将更为猖狂地侵犯我国领空，五月十二日的蓄意挑衅，完全证明了这一点。这不能不引起中国人民的高度警惕。
    四月十日，周恩来总理对巴基斯坦《黎明报》记者清楚明确地谈到了中国对美国政策的四句话。美国政府应当牢牢记住。
    我们严正地警告美国政府：你们的战争挑衅，是吓不倒中国人民的。中国人民说话是算数的。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加到中国人民头上，中国人民一定奉陪到底，一定要叫美国侵略者进得来，出不去，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭美国侵略者！
