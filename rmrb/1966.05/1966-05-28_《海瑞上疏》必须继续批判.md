Title: 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 Must Be Continuously Criticized

    《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 is a poisoned arrow in the "national chessboard" with which right-opportunists attacked the Party. This point was revealed when Comrade Ding Xuelei's article, 《Who Does "Hai Rui Submits His Memorial" Serve?》 (《Liberation Daily》, February 12, 1966), was published.

    We believe that Comrade Ding Xuelei's article exposes the truth correctly, well, and powerfully. 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 is an out-and-out anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous weed! It appeared on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1959, frantically making a big deal out of "cursing," like Wu Han's 《Hai Rui Reprimands the Emperor》, directly aiming the spearhead at our great Party.

    At that time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people had achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The broad masses of working people felt extremely happy and encouraged by this. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, held in August 1959, pointed out: "The experience of 1958 clearly demonstrated that the wisdom and strength of the masses are infinite. This wisdom and strength, inspired and led by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, encouraged and organized by the Party's General Line, are like a mighty army, unstoppable, truly making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way." What a scene of enthusiasm and prosperity! But in the eyes of the creators of 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》, it was all darkness: "The weather is cold and the people are freezing," "Every household is clean and bare!" This small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist people, relying on their reactionary class instincts, saw the capitalist economic base and its superstructure collapsing day by day, and couldn't help but cry out: "No more waiting!" They shot poisoned arrows at the Party, cursing the Party Central Committee as "unprincipled," "having a head as if it had no head"; demanding that the Party "apologize to the people of the world," which meant apologizing to landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as all reactionary exploiting classes; finally, they revealed their hideous faces: "I'm not just cursing them once for the sake of pleasure!" "I want to drag them down from their horses!" Look, this is their true purpose: to make the Party step down, to let right-opportunists, that is, revisionists, take the stage, usurp leadership, and be pioneers for capitalist restoration. How can we not conduct serious criticism and thorough exposure of such an anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weed?

    However, some people have launched a frantic counterattack against Comrade Ding Xuelei's critical article, especially those "heroes" who once styled themselves as "fearless" and "dare to speak out." They panicked in the face of this criticism, hurriedly claiming that they had not seriously participated in the creation of this play, wanting to slip away; they hurriedly stated that 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 and 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 had no connection; they announced that the creation of this play had no connection with the reality of the time, therefore it could not be "simply compared" or "rigidly shadowed"; they claimed that the subjective motives for writing the play were good, only the objective effect was not good; ... In short, in a thousand sentences, their purpose in counterattacking was: to try every means to escape, to deny, to try to clear themselves of all relations with right opportunism, that is, revisionism.

    Did you really not seriously participate in the creation of this play?

    Trying to cover up is only making it more obvious. A storm of a world-shaking Cultural Revolution washed away all paper-paste disguises. Opening up the issue, this play was directed and written under the careful planning of Zhou Xinfang, the president of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre, and Tao Xiong, the vice-president, and others. The "Foreword" to 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 also states that from April 1959, "President Zhou Xinfang specifically participated in the creation of this play, ... and worked with the writer to deliberate and revise it word by word." Tao Xiong specifically led and participated in the creation of this play from beginning to end, and the above-mentioned "Foreword" was written voluntarily by him; after the play was performed, he repeatedly wrote review articles under a pseudonym, promoting it greatly and expanding the reactionary influence of 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》. Now these people suddenly pretend not to have actively participated in the creation, isn't this trying to pull off a "golden cicada sloughing its skin" trick?

    Do your 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 and Wu Han's 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 really have no connection?

    This is even more of a blatant lie. Your connections are very close.

    Before the Lushan Conference in August 1959, it was precisely when right opportunists were launching a rampant attack on the Party and on socialism. At this time, Wu Han threw out his 《Hai Rui Reprimands the Emperor》, viciously cursing the Chinese Communist Party, and encouraging people who "want to scold the emperor but cannot" to "scold in the play"; Shanghai also had Jiang Xingyu, who consistently wrote anti-communist articles, published 《Southern Bao Gong - Hai Rui》, to provide you with creation materials, that is, shells for attacking the Party. In this way, your 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 came out in a posture of rampant attack. Is this not connected?

    The Lushan Conference crushed the attack of the right opportunists. The right opportunists were dismissed from their posts. Wu Han simply "broke out of the door" to write a play, he openly said: "Comrade Zhou Xinfang's 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 in Shanghai" "has been brought to the stage," "a national chessboard is necessary." "Cursing" already existed, so now there is "dismissal." Launch a counterattack against the Party. You, one in the south and one in the north, one "cursing" and one "dismissing," one attacking and one counterattacking, echoing each other, sharing the same ideology, what a close connection! 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 and 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 are two melons on the same vine, strung together on the same anti-Party vine of right opportunism. Despite the means of turning clouds over one's hand and rain over the other, you still cannot quibble.

    You also say that the creation of this play has no connection with the reality of the time, saying that the subjective motives are good. This is all nonsense. Now, the behind-the-scenes truth has finally been revealed. Under the guidance of the anti-Party and anti-socialist "dare to say and dare to curse" ideology, you really devoted painstaking efforts and racked your brains for the design of this play. There were also some people who lost their position or were ideologically confused, who offered you advice and suggestions, making you even more ecstatic. In order to embody the reactionary theme ideology, you discussed and discussed, selected and selected, and finally chose the plot of Hai Rui submitting the 《Security Memorial》 to Emperor Jiajing, to "directly state the number one issue in the world" -- launching a frenzied attack on the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

    We only need to look at a few important designs of this script to easily expose your disguise and evasions, and reveal your anti-Party true colors.

    First, you emphasized that Hai Rui in the script should dare to speak and dare to curse, with "dare" as the top priority, only then would there be "spirit of the times." A single sentence leaked the truth. Of course, you don't need the "spirit of the times" of a feudal dead man hundreds of years ago, so what kind of "spirit of the times" do you want? Our great era is the era of the thorough proletarian revolution. The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, is the spirit of our socialist era. You hate this great spirit of the times to the core. Not only will you not promote it, but you are desperately opposing it. The so-called "spirit of the times" you promote, translated into clear and easy-to-understand language, is the reactionary restoration thought of today's landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Of course, you are not cursing the feudal emperor Zhu Houcong who has long turned to dust, but cursing our great Party and slandering our proletarian dictatorship. Of course, Hai Rui, as a loyal and filial subject of the feudal class, is unable to fulfill such a "task," so you came up with such an idea: to make appropriate "sublimation" of Hai Rui's spiritual outlook, to make him speak the words of modern people. The so-called "sublimation," the so-called "speaking the words of modern people," the meaning is very clear, your purpose is not to write any "historical drama," not to write biographies for any ancient people, but to shape a "upright and unyielding" right opportunist "hero"!

    In the script, this "hero" cursed the Party and the proletarian dictatorship, what "the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam is crooked," what "discipline is corrupt," what "one word brings guilt," what "the human world is no different from the gates of hell," what "today has reached the point of heavenly anger and popular resentment," "people's hearts are becoming more and more uncontrollable!" Cursing like this, you are still not relieved, simply even cursed "tyrant." It's really strange, Hai Rui, who submitted the 《Security Memorial》, clearly called Emperor Jiajing a wise and decisive ruler with extraordinary wisdom, but Zhou Xinfang insisted on denouncing a "tyrant," one "tyrant" was not enough, but also added "the most tyrannical tyrant," and in the final draft changed it to "abuse of power," "despotic and cruel," "ungrateful and unrighteous tyrant"; also said that this "tyrant" has "reached the terminal stage," even "the lungs and bowels are rotten," must use heavy drugs such as "rhubarb" and "croton" to "purge a big scene"! What the spearhead is pointing at, is it still unclear? Can people with "good motives" towards the Party and the proletarian dictatorship do such a thing?

    This anti-Party "hero" thoroughly embodies the frenzied energy of right opportunists fighting against the Party. He scolds others as "yes-men," calling them "deaf and mute," "wisely protecting themselves," "yes-sayers," "cowardly," "flattering," "holding positions without doing any work," "slippery and skillful, all-rounders," all of whom are "court officials who dare not speak frankly," while he himself, "unwilling to live in peace and steal rank and wealth, would rather seek neck blood sprinkled on golden steps," "Even if I am beaten with rods in the Golden Palace -- exiled to the border -- beheaded in the West Market -- I am dead and have no regrets!" Finally, he simply carried the coffin onto the stage to "demonstrate." What exactly does this right opportunist disguised as Hai Rui want to do? "My memorial, guaranteed to make him enlightened, pour cold water on his head," "cold sweat like rain"! He also fiercely "raises the stick on his head," claiming to beat the "foolish king" until he "vomits blood" and is "dying." What venomous language! Deng Tuo wanted to "shower dog blood" on our Party, here comes a "pour cold water on his head"; Deng Tuo wanted to use a stick to beat our Party into "shock," here comes a "stick on the head" to beat it until it "vomits blood" and is "dying." How similar are the languages of these anti-Party right opportunists!

    Secondly, an important design of yours is to emphasize the need to write about the "social basis" of this fake Hai Rui's daring to speak and dare to curse. Zhou Xinfang repeatedly insisted on expressing Hai Rui seeing the tragic experiences of the people, and then pointing out "The person who instigated this memorial is the people suffering in the country!" Hai Rui, as a feudal bureaucrat in history, could not possibly be a spokesperson for the suffering people; then who exactly are today's "Hai Rui," that is, right opportunists, speaking for among the "suffering" people? What kind of people is his "social basis"? Under the brilliant light of the General Line, in the revolutionary torrent of the Great Leap Forward, the people are high-spirited, full of fighting spirit, and exultant. Who feels "internal disaster and external humiliation, the people are not living," Who is lamenting "every household is clean and bare," Who is slandering "full of devastation" and "national affairs are completely wrong," They are landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, they are the so-called "social basis" of the right opportunists. The script desperately speaks out for this group of demons and monsters, saying what "livelihood is in danger," "wandering around," "homeless," saying what "natural and man-made disasters, widespread mourning," "complaints are everywhere, everyone is cursing the present." You describe socialist society as so dark, what difference is there from all reactionary forces at home and abroad!

    The anti-Party "Hai Rui" do not just curse. They want to take the place of the proletarian dictatorship together with this group of "social basis." They first clamor to our party "fix one or two out of ten mistakes", and then "hope" that the "face of" socialist countries "changes", and finally designed a "change of sky" scene to vent their hatred for the proletarian dictatorship, and also let Hai Rui's people hide under his big umbrella, waiting for an opportunity to restore. Cursing is just a means; seizing power is their ultimate goal. Authors of 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》, aren’t you exposing yourself too much by so impatiently hoping for a "change of sky"?

    You have another important design for this script, which is to let Hai Rui go to the Golden Palace and launch a "face-to-face" struggle with the emperor.

    Tao Xiong wrote in the "Foreword" to 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》: "In such a good play, the memorialist Hai Rui is not present, and the conflict of the play cannot be pulled up. After several studies, no good way could be figured out. Finally, under the inspiration of a leading comrade, when the mind was liberated, it was thought that although the historical fact was that Hai Rui was indeed not present, but writing it into a historical drama, why can't Hai Rui be allowed to go to the Golden Palace to launch a legal struggle with the emperor face to face?"

    This is another confession without being forced, another big exposure. According to "historical facts," "Hai Rui was indeed not present," it is impossible to go to the Golden Palace, he would not use the "legal struggle" means commonly used by some modern people; but, isn't "launching a legal struggle with us face to face" precisely the consistent trick of right opportunists! No wonder some bourgeois elements jumped out and applauded this scene as "the most exciting"!

    The script instigates demons and monsters to carry out a "legal struggle" with our Party, and it does not stop at one place. The eighth scene, "Risky Memorial," is a "legal struggle," and the tenth scene, "Kneeling and Begging for Life," is also a "legal struggle." Those "people" protesting against "public justice being overturned" and taking to the streets to demonstrate for "Hai Rui's loyal heart," isn't this carrying out counter-revolutionary demonstrations and petitions and carrying out subversion activities in a country of proletarian dictatorship! Your anti-Party activities are simply extremely rampant.

    Exposing these facts, isn't your "subjective motive" exposed in broad daylight? You, with malicious intent, firmly and unwaveringly stood on the position of right opportunism, that is, revisionism, and used weapons like 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 to launch a malicious attack on the Party. You played an important role in the anti-Party and anti-socialist chorus stirred up by right opportunists. When this play came out, you were so proud, you tried every means to expand the influence of this play through Shanghai newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses; you also wrote a large number of articles and sent them to all parts of the country for publication, praising this play lavishly, what "has a realistic educational role" what "resolute character is more sublimated" what "sufficient ideological depth" what "never considers personal gains or losses or life and death" what "can be a model for future generations" . You also put this "vivid and colorful good play" on the radio and broadcast it to the whole country. You performed this play in 1959, and in 1961 and 1962, just as American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries set off an anti-China climax, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists at home were plotting to carry out capitalist restoration, the right opportunists were again carrying out new reversal activities, you performed this play again and again. How closely you cooperated! At the end of 1961, after Wu Han's 《Hai Rui Dismissed from Office》 was performed, you moved 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》 to Beijing for public performance. Your "national chessboard" was played so tightly, and the two anti-Party and anti-socialist countercurrents just happened to converge at such a moment. Is this a coincidence? No, this is a pair of poisonous fetuses bred by the right opportunist political line!

    People can't help but ask: Why do these people who are dissatisfied with the Party dare to be so rampant in opposing the Party and socialism? Who exactly is supporting them behind the scenes? According to our understanding, in addition to a small handful of people in Shanghai who supported them, cheered them up, and emboldened them, they also had a "backer," who was a vice minister of the Central Propaganda Department, who not only gave ideas and sent materials for 《Hai Rui Submits His Memorial》, but also, after watching the performance of this play, praised it in person as a "good play," and made an affirmative conclusion for it.

    "Dare to speak and dare to speak," "upright and unyielding" anti-Party "heroes," why are you silent? Why are you shrinking back? Why do you want to fabricate some lies about "good motives, bad effects"? Black and white, how can you deny it? The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up, the revolutionary masses have risen up, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, where the red flag of the Cultural Revolution is planted, there the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line will be eliminated, the old roots of capitalism and revisionism will be dug up, none of you can escape!

### 《海瑞上疏》必须继续批判

    《海瑞上疏》必须继续批判
    方泽生
    《海瑞上疏》是右倾机会主义分子向党进攻的“全国一盘棋”中的一支毒箭。这一点，在丁学雷同志所写的《〈海瑞上疏〉为谁效劳？》（《解放日报》一九六六年二月十二日）一文发表的时候，已经揭露出来了。
    我们认为：丁学雷同志的文章揭得对，揭得好，揭得有力。《海瑞上疏》是一棵不折不扣的反党反社会主义的大毒草！它出现在一九五九年中华人民共和国成立十周年的前夕，疯狂地在“骂”字上大做文章，象吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》一样，把矛头直接指向我们伟大的党。
    当时，中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。广大劳动人民对此感到极大的欢欣鼓舞。一九五九年八月举行的党的八届八中全会指出：“一九五八年的经验特别明显地证明，人民群众的智慧和力量是无穷的。这种智慧和力量，由于党和毛泽东同志的启发和领导，由于党的总路线的鼓舞和组织，有如千军万马，所向无前，真是高山也要低头，河水也要让路。”这是一片多么热气腾腾、欣欣向荣的景象！而在《海瑞上疏》的创作者们眼里，却是一片黑暗：“天寒地冻万家冷”，“家家户户，干干净净”！这一小撮反党反社会主义的人们凭着他们反动的阶级嗅觉，眼看着资本主义的经济基础及其上层建筑一天天地土崩瓦解了，便熬不住地喊叫起来：“不可一日等待了！”他们向党射出毒箭，咒骂党中央“无道”、“有头如同无头”；要党“向天下百姓谢罪”，也就是向地富反坏右以及一切反动剥削阶级谢罪；最后，他们露出了狰狞的面目：“我又不是骂他一场，图个痛快！”“要将他们拉下马！”看，这便是他们的真正目的：要党下台，让右倾机会主义者即修正主义者上台，篡夺领导权，为资本主义复辟打先锋。对于这种反党反社会主义的大毒草，怎么能不进行严肃的批判和彻底的揭露呢？
    但是，有人却对丁学雷同志的批判文章进行了疯狂的反扑，特别是那些曾经自命为“无惧无恐”、“敢说敢言”的“英雄”们。他们在这个批判面前慌了手脚，忙不迭地推说自己并没有认真地参与这个戏的创作，想要滑脚溜走；他们急急忙忙表示《海瑞上疏》和《海瑞罢官》是没有联系的；他们宣布创作这个戏同当时的现实是没有联系的，因此不能拿来“简单类比”，“生硬影射”；他们声称写戏的主观动机是好的，只是客观效果不好；……总之，千句并一句，他们反扑的目的是：想尽一切办法企图脱身，企图抵赖，想要撇清自己和右倾机会主义即修正主义的一切关系。
    你们真的没有认真地参与这个戏的创作吗？
    欲盖弥彰。一场翻天覆地的文化大革命的暴风雨，把所有纸糊伪装冲刷得干干净净。把问题揭开来看，这个戏就是在上海京剧院院长周信芳和副院长陶雄等人的精心计划之下编导出来的。《海瑞上疏》的“前记”中也说，从一九五九年四月开始，“周信芳院长具体参加了这个戏的创作活动，……和执笔者一道作了逐字逐句的推敲和修改”。陶雄则是自始至终地具体领导并参与了这个戏的创作，上面讲的“前记”，就是他自告奋勇写的；当戏演出以后，他又一再化名写评论文章，为之大事鼓吹，扩大《海瑞上疏》的反动影响。现在这些人却忽然装成并没有积极参与创作的样子，岂不是想来一个“金蝉脱壳”之计么？
    你们的《海瑞上疏》和吴晗的《海瑞罢官》真的没有联系吗？
    这更是十足的谎话。你们的联系紧密得很。
    一九五九年八月庐山会议之前，正是右倾机会主义分子向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻的时候。就在这个时候，吴晗抛出了他的《海瑞骂皇帝》，恶毒地咒骂中国共产党，并且鼓动“想骂皇帝而不可得”的人“在戏上骂”；上海还有一个一贯撰写反共文章的蒋星煜，发表了《南包公——海瑞》，为你们提供创作材料即向党进攻的炮弹。就这样，你们的《海瑞上疏》以猖狂进攻的姿态出笼了。这是互不联系的吗？
    庐山会议粉碎了右倾机会主义分子的进攻。右倾机会主义分子被罢了官。吴晗索性自己“破门而出”写起戏来，他公开说：“上海周信芳同志的《海瑞上疏》”“已搬上舞台”，“全国一盘棋是必须的”①。“骂”已经有了，就再来一个“罢”。对党进行反扑。你们一南一北，一“骂”一“罢”，一个进攻，一个反扑，同声相应，同气相求，联系又是何等密切呀！《海瑞上疏》和《海瑞罢官》是一根藤上的两个瓜，是串联在同一根右倾机会主义的反党瓜藤上面的。尽管有翻手为云、覆手为雨的法门，你们还是狡辩不了。
    你们又说什么创作这个戏同当时的现实是没有联系的，说什么主观动机是好的。全是一派胡言。现在，黑幕终于被揭开了。你们在反党反社会主义的“敢说敢骂”的指导思想下，确实为这个戏的设计呕尽心血，动足脑筋。还有一些丧失立场的人或者思想糊涂的人，替你们出谋献计，使你们更加得意忘形。为了体现反动的主题思想，你们议了又议，选了又选，最后终于选定了海瑞向嘉靖皇帝上《治安疏》的情节，来“直言天下第一事”——发动对党中央、毛主席的疯狂攻击。
    我们只消看一看你们对这个剧本的几点重要设计，就不难戳穿你们的伪装和遁词，揭露你们的反党真面目了。
    首先，你们强调剧本里的海瑞要敢说敢骂，“敢”字当头，这才有“时代精神”。一句话漏了底。你们当然不需要几百年前封建死人的“时代精神”，那末，你们究竟要什么样的“时代精神”呢？我们这个伟大的时代，是无产阶级彻底革命的时代。光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想，无产阶级彻底革命的精神，就是我们社会主义的时代精神。这个伟大的时代精神，是你们恨透了的。你们不但不会提倡，而且在那里拼命反对。你们提倡的所谓“时代精神”，翻译成明白晓畅的语言，就是今天地富反坏右的反动的复辟思想。你们骂的当然也不是那个早已化为尘土的封建皇帝朱厚熜，而是咒骂我们伟大的党，污蔑我们的无产阶级专政。当然，作为封建阶级的忠臣孝子的海瑞，是无法胜任这样的“任务”的，于是，你们就出了这样的主意：要把海瑞的精神面貌作适当“升华”，让他说今人的话。所谓“升华”，所谓“说今人的话”，意思是最明白不过的了，你们的目的并不是要写什么“历史剧”，并不是要为什么古人立传，而是要塑造一个“刚正不阿”的右倾机会主义的“英雄”！
    在剧本里，这个“英雄”对党和无产阶级专政破口大骂，什么“上梁不正下梁歪”，什么“纪纲败坏”，什么“一言获罪”，什么“人间无异地狱门”，什么“今日已到天怒人怨的地步”，“人心越发不可收拾了！”……骂得这个样子，你们还不解恨，索性连“暴君”也骂出来了。真是奇怪，上《治安疏》的海瑞明明称嘉靖帝为“天质英断，睿识绝人”的明君，而周信芳却坚持要痛骂“暴君”，一个“暴君”还不够，还要加上“最最暴的君”，定稿时又改为“滥施淫威”、“专横暴戾”、“寡恩薄义的暴君”；还说这个“暴君”已“病入膏肓”，连“肺腑都烂了”，必须用“大黄”、“巴豆”等重药“大泻一场”！矛头所向，究竟指的什么，难道还不清楚吗？对党对无产阶级专政怀有“良好动机”的人，能干得出这种事情来吗？
    这个反党的“英雄”，彻底地体现了右倾机会主义分子向党作斗争的疯狂劲。他把别人骂为“乡愿”、“甘草”，称他们“装聋作哑”、“明哲保身”、“唯唯诺诺”、“胆小怕事”、“阿谀逢迎”、“尸位素餐”、“圆滑机巧，八面玲珑”，都是些“不敢直言谏当朝”的“调停国手”，而他自己呢，“不愿苟安偷爵禄，宁求颈血洒金阶”，“纵然将我金殿杖刑——边外充军——西市斩首——我也是死而无怨！”最后干脆连棺材也抬上台来“示威”了。这个化装为海瑞的右倾机会主义者究竟要干什么呢？“我这道疏本，管叫他醍醐灌顶，冷水浇头”，“冷汗如雨”！他还恶狠狠地“举起当头棒”，声称要把“昏王”打得“吐血”、“奄奄一息”。多么刻毒的语言！邓拓对我们党要用“狗血淋头”，这里来了一个“冷水浇头”；邓拓要用棍棒把我们党打得“休克”，这里又来一个“当头棒”打得“吐血”和“奄奄一息”。这些反党的右倾机会主义分子的语言，何其相似乃尔！
    其次，你们的一个重要设计，是强调要写出这个假海瑞敢说敢骂的“社会基础”。周信芳曾一再坚持要表现海瑞看到百姓的悲惨遭遇，然后点明“此疏主使之人，就是海内受苦受难的百姓！”历史上作为封建官僚的海瑞，当然不可能做受苦百姓的代言人；那么今天的“海瑞”即右倾机会主义者，到底是在代哪些“受苦受难”的人们讲话呢？他的“社会基础”又是何等样的人物呢？在总路线的光辉照耀下，在大跃进的革命洪流中，人民群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，兴高采烈，是谁感到“内灾外侮，民不聊生”呢？是谁在悲叹“家家户户，干干净净”呢？是谁在污蔑“满目疮痍”、“国事全非”呢？他们就是地富反坏右，他们就是右倾机会主义分子的所谓“社会基础”。剧本拼命替这批牛鬼蛇神呼冤叫苦，说什么“生计濒危”、“流离颠沛”、“无家可归”，说什么“天灾人祸，遍地哀鸿”、“怨声载道，人人咒骂当今”。你们把社会主义社会描写得这样漆黑一团，同国内外一切反动势力有什么两样！
    反党的“海瑞”们并不仅是骂骂算了。他们是要连同这批“社会基础”一起取无产阶级专政而代之的。他们先是叫嚷，要我们党“十样过错，改其一二”，然后“指望”着社会主义国家的“面目改”，最后还设计了一个“变天”的场面，发泄他们对无产阶级专政的仇恨，又让海瑞的子民们都躲到他的大伞下面，伺机复辟。骂，不过是一种手段；夺权，才是他们的最终目的。《海瑞上疏》的作者们，你们这样迫不及待地指望“变天”，不觉得自己太暴露了么？
    你们对这个剧本还有一条重要的设计，就是让海瑞上金殿和皇帝展开“面对面”的斗争。
    陶雄在《海瑞上疏》“前记”中写道：“这样一场好戏，上疏人海瑞却不在场，戏的冲突矛盾就拉不上去。几经钻研，想不出好办法来。最后，在一位领导同志的启发下，思想一解放，才想到历史事实虽然海瑞确不在场，但写成一个历史剧，又何尝不可以让海瑞到金殿上去和皇帝面对面地展开合法斗争呢？”
    这又是一个不打自招，这又是一次大暴露。按“历史事实”，“海瑞确不在场”，不可能上金殿，他也不会运用某些现代人所惯用的“合法斗争”手段；但是，和我们“面对面地展开合法斗争”，岂不正是右倾机会主义分子的一贯伎俩么！怪不得有些资产阶级分子看到这里，便跳出来拍手高呼这一场戏“最令人兴奋”②了！
    剧本唆使牛鬼蛇神和我们党作“合法斗争”，远不止于一处。第八场“冒死上疏”是“合法斗争”，第十场“跪香请命”，也是“合法斗争”，那些“百姓”们抗议“公道倒颠”，上街游行为“耿耿海青天”请命，这不是要在无产阶级专政的国家里搞反革命的示威请愿，进行颠覆活动么！你们的反党活动，简直猖狂到极点了。
    揭出了这些事实，你们的“主观动机”不是暴露在光天化日之下了吗？你们居心险恶，坚定不移地站在右倾机会主义即修正主义的立场上，利用《海瑞上疏》这样的武器，向党发起恶毒的进攻。你们在右倾机会主义分子掀起的一场反党反社会主义的大合唱中，扮演了重要的角色。这个戏出来的时候，你们是多么得意呀，你们千方百计地通过上海的报纸、刊物、出版社，拼命扩大这个戏的影响；你们还写了大批文章，寄往全国各地发表，对这个戏大肆吹捧，什么“具有现实教育作用”②呀，什么“刚毅的性格更加升华”③呀，什么“足够的思想深度”④呀，什么“从来不考虑个人的得失或生死”⑤呀，什么“可为后世楷模”⑥呀。你们还把这台“有声有色的好戏”⑦搬上了电台，向全国广播。你们在一九五九年演出了这个戏，到了一九六一、六二年，正当美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起了反华高潮，国内的地富反坏右阴谋实行资本主义复辟，右倾机会主义分子又在进行新的翻案活动时，你们又一次再次地演出了这个戏。你们的配合何等紧密啊！一九六一年年底，在吴晗的《海瑞罢官》演出后，你们又把《海瑞上疏》搬到北京去公演，你们的“全国一盘棋”下得实在紧凑，两股反党反社会主义的逆流正好在这样的时刻合流了。这是一种偶然的巧合吗？不，这是右倾机会主义政治路线所孕育出来的一对孪生的毒胎！
    人们不禁要问：这批对党心怀不满的人为什么敢于如此猖狂地反党反社会主义呢？究竟是谁在背后支持他们呢？据我们了解，除了在上海有一小撮人替他们撑腰、鼓气、壮胆而外，他们还有一个“靠山”，是中央宣传部的一位副部长，他不但为《海瑞上疏》出点子、送资料，而且在看了这个戏的演出以后，亲口赞之曰“好戏”，为它作了肯定的结论。
    “敢说敢言”、“刚正不阿”的反党“英雄”们，你们为什么沉默了呢？你们为什么缩回去了呢？你们为什么要编造一些“动机好、效果不好”的谎言呢？白纸黑字，你们怎么抵赖得掉呢？广大的工农兵起来了，革命的群众起来了，在毛泽东思想的指引下，文化大革命的红旗插到那里，那里就要搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线，掘掉资本主义和修正主义的老根，你们谁也躲不了！
