    The film "Two Stage Sisters" depicts Zhu Chunhua, a famous actress who performed emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties for over ten years in the old society, as a bourgeois artist. However, the film embellishes her, portraying her as having flesh-and-blood ties with the poor peasants in the countryside, and passing her off as a proletarian artist, as if she can serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers without ideological transformation. Does this deceive us?
    The film uses deceptive tactics to fabricate a character—Xiao Chunhua—to glorify Zhu Chunhua. Xiao Chunhua is a child bride who suffered exploitation and oppression; the scriptwriters depict her as a representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Although she doesn't appear much, the scriptwriters use her relationship with Zhu Chunhua to imply that Zhu Chunhua has deep class feelings for the poor peasants in the countryside, that she shares the same experiences and destiny as the poor and lower-middle peasants, and therefore, Zhu Chunhua becomes a representative of thousands of "Chunhuas." Not only that, when Xiao Chunhua first meets Zhu Chunhua, she greatly appreciates Zhu Chunhua's art, saying, "Your opera is sung so well!" After watching Zhu Chunhua's performance of "The White-Haired Girl" after liberation, Xiao Chunhua praises her again: "Your opera is sung even better now, it speaks to my heart!" This uses Xiao Chunhua's words to express the poor and lower-middle peasants' approval and affirmation of Zhu Chunhua's art and life path, whether it's her performances of traditional romances or revolutionary modern operas.
    To say that Zhu Chunhua is a proletarian artist, and to demand that we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, fully approve of her ideology and art, is something that cannot be done. We feel that Zhu Chunhua, who is warmly praised by the scriptwriters, doesn't have even a trace of the flavor of a proletarian revolutionary. First of all, her thinking is not right. A true proletarian revolutionary establishes a proletarian worldview and struggles and lives according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Zhu Chunhua is not like that; she lives according to Master Xing's words: "Be a decent person and sing operas seriously." At the same time, in the old China of the 1930s and 1940s, true revolutionaries participated in the struggle led by the Party to win national liberation. What common ground does this have with Zhu Chunhua, who is only striving for a stage where she can perform "freely"? Secondly, Zhu Chunhua's feelings are not right. The proletariat has a clear class viewpoint, loving whom to love and hating whom to hate, with no ambiguity. Zhu Chunhua did not draw a clear line with Xing Yuehong, a person who went into the arms of the enemy, but remained entangled and dragged on. Of course, it's not absolutely impossible for Xing Yuehong to correct her mistakes, but it must be through revolutionary education and transformation, and not like Zhu Chunhua, who thinks she can use sisterly affection to influence her, and let her step into the revolutionary ranks so easily. Zhu Chunhua's sisterly affection has no common ground with the class feelings between us, the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    We believe that Zhu Chunhua is not a proletarian artist, but a bourgeois artist, and she has no common language with the poor and lower-middle peasants. The film's scriptwriters fabricated a poor and lower-middle peasant image—Xiao Chunhua—to praise this imposter, Zhu Chunhua, to oppose Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. We will never agree to this. We want to warn you: Do not misappropriate the name of the poor and lower-middle peasants to peddle bourgeois black goods!

    不准盗用农民的名义

    影片《舞台姐妹》里的竺春花，是个在旧社会里演了十多年帝王将相、才子佳人戏的名演员，是资产阶级的艺术家。但影片却替她搽脂抹粉，描写她与农村的贫苦农民有血肉的联系，把她冒充为无产阶级的艺术家，好象她无需进行思想改造，就可以为工农兵服务。这骗得了我们吗？
    影片用偷天换日的办法，虚构了一个人物——小春花，来往竺春花脸上贴金。小春花是个受剥削受压迫的童养媳，编导者是把她当做贫下中农的代表描写的。她出场不多，但编导者却通过她与竺春花的关系借此说明：竺春花与农村的贫苦农民有着深厚的阶级感情，她和贫下中农有着同样的遭遇和同样的命运，因而，竺春花也就成了千千万万个“春花”的代表。不仅这样，小春花与竺春花初次相遇，就对竺春花的艺术大为欣赏地说：“你的戏文唱得真好！”解放后看了竺春花演出的《白毛女》，小春花又表扬她：“你的戏文唱得更好了，唱到我的心里了！”这是借小春花之口，对竺春花演的戏——无论是才子佳人戏或是革命现代戏，表示了贫下中农对竺春花的艺术和生活道路的赞许和肯定。
    说竺春花是个无产阶级的文艺家，要我们贫下中农对她的思想和艺术全部批准，这是办不到的。我们觉得编导者热烈歌颂的竺春花，没有一丁点儿无产阶级革命者的味道。首先是她的思想不对头。真正的无产阶级革命者是确立了无产阶级世界观，按照毛主席的指示去斗争、去生活的。竺春花却不是这样，她是按照邢师傅的话：“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”为准则去生活的。同时，在三十年代和四十年代的旧中国，真正的革命者都参加到党所领导的为争取民族解放的斗争中去了，这和竺春花只是争取一个可以让自己“自由”演出的舞台，有什么共同之处呢？其次，竺春花的感情不对头。无产阶级有着鲜明的阶级观点，爱的什么人，恨的什么人，一点也不含糊。象邢月红这样一个投到敌人怀抱中去的人，竺春花没有跟她划清界线，而是藕断丝连，拉拉扯扯。当然，邢月红也不是绝对没有改邪归正的可能，但必须经过革命的教育改造，而不能象竺春花那样用什么姐妹之情就可以感化她，并且让她这么轻易地就踏进革命队伍中来。竺春花的姐妹之情和我们贫下中农之间的阶级感情，没有丝毫共同之点。
    我们认为竺春花不是无产阶级文艺家，而是资产阶级文艺家，她和贫下中农没有共同语言。影片的编导伪造了一个贫下中农形象——小春花去赞美竺春花这个冒牌货，来和毛主席的文艺思想唱对台戏，我们决不答应。我们要正告你们：不准盗用贫下中农的名义来贩卖资产阶级的黑货！
