    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Jakarta: While intensifying their collusion with US imperialism and its accomplices, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are increasingly and savagely carrying out racist persecution and frantic plunder against overseas Chinese in various parts of Indonesia, even to the point of cruel murder. Garrison authorities and right-wing thugs in various places are systematically and on a large scale adopting methods such as "takeover," "supervision," and "closure" to destroy and ruin overseas Chinese organizations, schools, and businesses they operate, leaving many overseas Chinese impoverished and on the brink of destitution.
    In Medan, North Sumatra, hundreds of thugs belonging to the "Indonesian Student Youth Unified Action Organization" (KAPI) forcibly "took over" thirteen buildings belonging to overseas Chinese organizations such as the Medan Overseas Chinese General Association, Teochew Association, and Fujian Association, as well as more than ten overseas Chinese schools, including the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Overseas Chinese Public School, and the Overseas Chinese Women's School, in the six days from March 26 to March 31. When forcibly occupying the aforementioned overseas Chinese organizations and overseas Chinese schools, the thugs arbitrarily tore up portraits of the Chinese people's beloved great leader Chairman Mao that were hanging indoors, looted Chinese national flags, stole all valuables, and wrote anti-China slogans such as "Expel the Chinese" on the walls. They also affixed seals with words such as "Belongs to the Republic of Indonesia" or "Belongs to KAPI" on the doors of the buildings and important assets, and then handed them over to the garrison authorities.
    Overseas Chinese organizations and overseas Chinese schools in Siantar, Sibolga, Tanjung Balai, Tinggi, Asahan, Bagan, Rantau, Kisaran, Rengat, and Binjai in North Sumatra were successively "taken over" by local garrisons and reactionary organizations from March 28 to April 9. On April 9, right-wing thugs also forcibly "took over" the Overseas Chinese General Association, Genhua School, and Overseas Chinese Youth Association in Greater Aceh, Sumatra. On April 18, the police authorities in Lhokseumawe, North Sumatra, also "closed down" the Chinese School, Overseas Chinese General Association, Fujian Association, Longyan Association, and Workers and Peasants Association in this area. The police authorities also ordered that overseas Chinese in this area were not allowed to leave Lhokseumawe.
    The Central Java Military Region Commander issued an order on April 20, placing all overseas Chinese schools in Central Java and the Yogyakarta Special Region under "supervision," and stipulated that overseas Chinese school teachers and students must obtain the approval of the military authorities before leaving their residences. Hundreds of right-wing thugs in Yogyakarta forcibly "took over" the Chinese Middle School, Chinese Elementary School No. 2 and its affiliated kindergarten and simplified elementary school in the city, and on April 23, they also forcibly occupied overseas Chinese organizations such as the Chinese Community Federation, Xinsheng Society, and Weigong Society.
    The East Java Military Region Commander issued an order on April 18 to "temporarily close" all overseas Chinese schools within its jurisdiction. Prior to this, the Surabaya Base Command ordered "supervision" of eighteen overseas Chinese middle and elementary schools in the city on March 26. Right-wing thugs also forcibly "took over" the Xinhua, Zhonghua, and Dazhong overseas Chinese schools in Surabaya on the 12th. At the same time, local military authorities "closed" and occupied ten overseas Chinese schools, including Qiaozhong, Qiaoguang, and Chinese Girls' School. On this day, hundreds of right-wing thugs, under the protection of local garrisons, wantonly destroyed and robbed the Surabaya Overseas Chinese Federation, and forcibly "took over" this overseas Chinese organization.
    The West Java military authorities also issued an order on April 23 to "close down" all overseas Chinese schools in this area.
    While forcibly occupying overseas Chinese organizations and overseas Chinese schools, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are also plundering overseas Chinese property and carrying out inhumane persecution and murder of overseas Chinese.
    According to a report in the Indonesian Army newspaper *Berita Yudha* on April 18, a reactionary organization called the "Bandung City Order Action Command" recently closed the Chinese commercial district in Bandung, closing the passages to this commercial district. Prior to this, right-wing thugs in Bandung had "taken over" all textile factories run by overseas Chinese in Bandung on April 12 and handed them over to the army authorities.
    Medan's *Waspada* reported on April 25 that right-wing thugs in Berastagi, Kabanjahe, Deli, and Sekitar in North Sumatra concentrated all the local overseas Chinese on April 21 and then sent people to forcibly occupy the shops they operated.
    When right-wing thugs in Surabaya forcibly occupied the residences of overseas Chinese organizations on April 23 with the assistance of the garrison, they brutally beat eight staff members present and then took them away in police cars. More than 1,000 right-wing thugs in Kediri carried out large-scale destruction and looting of overseas Chinese shops and residences on April 11 and destroyed the buildings of overseas Chinese organizations.
    In a small town called Lhoksukon in North Aceh, Sumatra, right-wing thugs forced more than 30 overseas Chinese youths to undress, then smeared them with red paint, and forced them to be exposed to the sun. In South Aceh's Tapaktuan, right-wing thugs also forced all overseas Chinese who had hung Chinese five-star red flags to gather together and then robbed them of all their property. Right-wing thugs also inhumanely murdered the leaders of local overseas Chinese organizations, Wen Dashan, Huang Muxiang, Zeng Yumin, and Ye Boxiang.

    印尼反动派对华侨进行疯狂迫害和掠夺
    各地驻军当局和右派暴徒恣意抢劫使许多华侨生活濒临绝境
    新华社一日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派反动势力在加紧同美帝国主义及其帮凶勾结的同时，正变本加厉地在印度尼西亚各地对华侨进行野蛮的种族主义迫害和疯狂掠夺，甚至残暴凶杀。各地的驻军当局和右派暴徒正有计划地大规模地采取
  “接管”、“监督”、“封闭”等方式，来摧残和破坏华侨团体、学校以及他们经营的企业，使许多华侨倾家荡产，生活濒临绝境。
    在北苏门答腊棉兰，属于“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”（卡比）的数百名暴徒，在三月二十六日到三月三十一日的六天内，先后强行“接管”了棉兰华侨总会、潮州公会、福建会馆等华侨团体的十三个建筑物和华侨中学、中华侨民学校、华侨公学和华侨妇女学校等华侨学校十多所。暴徒在强占上述华侨团体和华侨学校时，恣意撕毁室内悬挂的中国人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的画象，劫走中国国旗，抢走一切贵重财物，并且在墙上涂写“驱逐中国人”等反华标语。他们还在建筑物的门上和重要财物上贴了所谓“属于印度尼西亚共和国所有”或“属于卡比所有”的字样的封条，然后移交给驻军当局。
    北苏门答腊的先达、三板头、实武牙、丁宜、亚沙汉、吧敢、兰都、奇沙兰、冷吉和民礼等地的华侨团体和华侨学校，已在三月二十八日到四月九日先后被当地驻军和反动组织“接管”。右派暴徒还在四月九日强行“接管”了苏门答腊大亚齐的华侨总会、根华学校和华侨青年会。四月十八日，北苏门答腊冷沙的警察当局还“封闭”了这个地区的中华学校、华侨总会、福建公会、龙岩同乡会和工农会。警察当局还下令不允许这个地区的华侨离开冷沙。
    中爪哇军区司令在四月二十日颁布命令，把所有中爪哇和日惹特区的华侨学校置于“监督”之下，并且规定华侨学校教师和学生要得到军事当局的批准才能离开他们的住地。日惹的右派暴徒数百人强行“接管”了这个城市的中华中学、中华小学第二校及其附设幼儿园和简易小学，他们在四月二十三日还强占了中华社团联合会、新生社、唯公社等华侨团体。
    东爪哇军区司令在四月十八日下令“暂时封闭”所辖地区内的全部华侨学校。在这以前，泗水基地司令部在三月二十六日下令对全市十八所华侨中、小学校实行“监督”。右派暴徒还在十二日强行“接管”泗水的新华、中华和大众三所华侨学校。与此同时，当地军事当局“封闭”和占领了侨众、侨光、中国女学等十所华侨学校。在这一天，数百名右派暴徒在当地驻军的保护下，放肆地对泗水的华侨联合会进行破坏和抢劫，并强行
  “接管”了这个华侨团体。
    西爪哇的军事当局也在四月二十三日下令“封闭”了这个地区的全部华侨学校。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力在强占华侨团体和华侨学校的同时，大肆掠夺华侨财产，对华侨进行惨无人道的迫害和凶杀。
    据印度尼西亚陆军机关报《战斗报》四月十八日报道，一个被叫做“万隆市秩序行动指挥部”的反动机构，最近封闭了万隆市的华人商业区，封闭了这个商业区的通道。在此以前，万隆的右派暴徒曾经在四月十二日“接管”了万隆市所有由华侨开办的纺织厂，并把它们交给了陆军当局。
    棉兰《警钟报》四月二十五日报道，北苏门答腊的美伦、打京岸、怡里和司吉利等地的右派暴徒曾在四月二十一日把当地华侨全部集中起来，然后派人强占了他们经营的商店。
    泗水市的右派暴徒在驻军协助下，在四月二十三日强占华侨团体住所时，曾凶蛮地殴打在场的八名工作人员，然后用警车把他们载走。谏义里的一千多名右派暴徒在四月十一日对华侨商店和住宅进行了大规模的破坏和抢劫，并且捣毁了华侨团体的建筑物。
    在苏门答腊亚齐北部的一个名叫鹿树昆的小镇，右派暴徒曾强迫三十多个华侨青年脱光衣服，然后在他们身上涂满红漆，迫使他们在阳光下曝晒。在亚齐南部的南必力，右派暴徒还曾经强迫所有悬挂过中国五星红旗的华侨集中在一起，然后抢走他们的全部财物。右派暴徒还惨无人道地杀害了当地华侨团体的领导人温达善、黄木祥、曾裕民和叶柏祥等四人。
