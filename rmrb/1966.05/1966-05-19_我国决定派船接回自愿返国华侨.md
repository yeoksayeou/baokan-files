    The Indonesian Government Unreasonably Refuses to Fulfill Its Responsibility to Send Back Victimized Overseas Chinese
    China Decides to Send Ships to Bring Back Overseas Chinese Who Voluntarily Return to China
    China's Foreign Ministry Indignantly Refutes the Indonesian Government's Denial of Its Crimes of Anti-China and Anti-Chinese Discrimination in a Note; Solemnly Demands an Immediate End to the Persecution of Overseas Chinese, the Release of All Arrested and Detained Overseas Chinese, Guarantees the Safety of Overseas Chinese Who Voluntarily Return to China and the Ships and Crew Sent to Pick Them Up, and Provides Necessary Facilitation; Suggests That the Two Governments Immediately Conduct Specific Discussions and Make Proper Arrangements So That the Work of Bringing Overseas Chinese Back to China Can Proceed Smoothly.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th May—Zhang Tong, Director of the First Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, summoned Baron Soedadi Sasastra, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Indonesian Embassy in China, on the 18th, and submitted to him a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The note expressed great indignation at the Indonesian government's attempt in its note of the 5th to deny its crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination, openly defend its crimes of persecuting Overseas Chinese, and brazenly reject the four demands of the Chinese government to send back victimized Overseas Chinese.
    The note once again demands that the Indonesian government be responsible for arranging ships to send Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China back to China, and notifies the Indonesian government that the Chinese government has decided to send ships to Indonesia in the near future to bring back victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China before the Indonesian government fulfills its due responsibilities.
    The note also suggests that, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the work of bringing Overseas Chinese back to China, the two governments should immediately conduct specific discussions and make appropriate arrangements.
    The full text of the note is as follows: To the Embassy of Indonesia in China:
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its greetings to the Embassy of Indonesia in China and states the following regarding the Embassy's note of May 5, 1966:
    In the note, the Indonesian government attempted to deny its crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination, openly defended its atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese, and brazenly rejected the four demands of the Chinese government regarding the return of victimized Overseas Chinese. This attitude of the Indonesian government is utterly unreasonable. The Chinese government expresses its great indignation at this.
    Since October of last year, you have launched a large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign and carried out inhumane persecution of Overseas Chinese. What you have done is completely contrary to the wishes of the broad masses of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people want to be friendly with the Chinese people and want to get along well with the Overseas Chinese. Your heinous activities of colluding with imperialism and frantically opposing China and discriminating against the Chinese have been resolutely opposed by the Indonesian people. The note stubbornly describes the atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese as "reactions of the angry masses" and claims that this was caused by the broadcasts of Radio Beijing and the attitudes and behaviors of Overseas Chinese. Your attempt to cleanse yourselves of your crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination by using the name of the Indonesian "masses" will certainly not succeed. This statement of yours is a great insult to the Indonesian people.
    Your so-called "masses" are not the real masses; to put it bluntly, they are just a handful of Indonesian reactionaries. The reason you hate China is simply because China adheres to the anti-imperialist revolutionary stance. The reason you constantly curse Radio Beijing is simply because Radio Beijing has exposed your crimes of colluding with imperialism and opposing communism and the people. The reason you frantically persecute Overseas Chinese is simply because the vast majority of Overseas Chinese love their motherland and strive to develop friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people. In short, your rampant opposition to China and discrimination against the Chinese is completely unpopular and absolutely cannot harm the great People's Republic of China, but can only expose your ugly face as an anti-China pawn of imperialism.
    The four demands put forward by the Chinese government on the issue of sending back persecuted Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China are completely reasonable and just. In the note, the Indonesian government actually claimed that it was not necessary to meet the Chinese government's demands and mentioned that Overseas Chinese returning to China were due to the Chinese government's orders or political measures. Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik also publicly stated that the Indonesian government did not expel Overseas Chinese to return to China, and if they wanted to leave Indonesia, all responsibility must be borne by themselves and the Chinese government that suggested repatriation. These statements are utterly absurd.
    As is known to all, the Indonesian government has made the persecution of Overseas Chinese an important component of its anti-China policy. You have organized and planned a series of atrocities against Overseas Chinese, causing a large number of Overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations to be impoverished, lose their livelihoods, and be unable to continue to survive in Indonesia. Under these circumstances, it is only natural for the persecuted Overseas Chinese to request to return to their country. How can it be said that these Overseas Chinese's request to return to their country is due to the orders and political measures of the Chinese government? And how can it be said that the Indonesian government does not bear responsibility because it did not order their expulsion? No matter how you quibble, you cannot shirk all the responsibilities you should bear.
    It must be pointed out that the request of the victimized Overseas Chinese, who are in dire straits, to return to their country is completely different from the return of foreigners under normal circumstances. The safety of these Overseas Chinese's lives and property is not guaranteed at all, so how can they be required to go through the procedures for foreigners leaving the country under normal circumstances? The Indonesian government hypocritically says that it does not oppose Overseas Chinese returning to their country, but it rejects the four reasonable demands of the Chinese government and emphasizes that departure procedures must be handled in accordance with the Indonesian government's regulations and ordinances. This can only be regarded as deliberately trying to make things difficult for and obstruct the return of Overseas Chinese. The Chinese government cannot but pay close attention to this conspiracy.
    At present, tens of thousands of victimized Overseas Chinese in Indonesia have lost their livelihoods and are urgently requesting to return to their country. The Indonesian government neither provides them with due relief and resettlement nor arranges ships to send them back to China. The Chinese government certainly cannot ignore their fate. The Chinese government once again demands that the Indonesian government be responsible for arranging ships to send Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China back to China. Before the Indonesian government fulfills its due responsibilities, the Chinese government has decided to send ships to Indonesia in the near future to bring back victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China. To this end, the Chinese government requests the Indonesian government:
    1. Immediately stop persecuting Overseas Chinese, release all arrested and detained Overseas Chinese, and effectively guarantee the safety of Overseas Chinese's lives and property.
    2. Ensure the safety of Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their country on their way to the port and during their stay in the port, provide necessary facilitation in transportation and living, simplify their departure procedures, and must not obstruct them from carrying their own property and funds back.
    3. Ensure the safety of Chinese ships sent to pick up Overseas Chinese and their crew entering and leaving Indonesian ports and during their stay in the port, and provide necessary assistance and convenience.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the work of bringing Overseas Chinese back to China, the Chinese government suggests that the two governments immediately conduct specific discussions and make appropriate arrangements.
    The Chinese government hopes that the Indonesian government will respond promptly to the Chinese government's above-mentioned requests.
    Please accept the highest respect.

    印度尼西亚政府无理拒绝履行送回受害华侨的责任
    我国决定派船接回自愿返国华侨
    我外交部在照会中愤慨驳斥印度尼西亚政府抵赖反华排华罪责；严正要求立即停止迫害华侨，释放全部被捕被禁华侨，保证自愿返国华侨和接侨船只和船员的安全并给予必要的便利；建议两国政府立即具体商谈，妥善安排，使接运华侨回国工作能够顺利进行。
    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国外交部第一亚洲司司长张彤十八日召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦·苏达迪沙斯特拉，向他提交了一份中国外交部的照会，照会对印度尼西亚政府在五日来照中妄图抵赖它反华排华的罪责，公然为迫害华侨的罪行进行狡辩并且悍然拒绝中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府送回受害华侨的四项要求表示极大的愤慨。
    照会再一次要求印度尼西亚政府负责安排船只，把自愿返国的华侨送回中国，并通知印度尼西亚政府：中国政府决定在印度尼西亚政府没有履行自己应负的责任之前，在最近期间派遣船只前往印度尼西亚，接回自愿返国的受害华侨。
    照会还建议，为了使接运华侨回国的工作顺利进行，两国政府立即进行具体商谈，作出妥善的安排。
    照会全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚驻华大使馆致意，并就大使馆一九六六年五月五日来照申述如下：
    印度尼西亚政府在来照中妄图抵赖反华排华的罪责，公然为迫害华侨的暴行进行狡辩，并且悍然拒绝了中国政府关于要求印度尼西亚政府送回受害华侨的四项要求。印度尼西亚政府这种态度是十分无理的。中国政府对此表示极大的愤慨。
    自从去年十月以来，你们掀起了大规模的反华排华活动，对华侨进行了惨无人道的迫害。你们的所作所为，同印度尼西亚广大人民的意愿完全背道而驰。印度尼西亚人民是要同中国人民友好的，是要同华侨友好相处的。你们投靠帝国主义，疯狂反华排华的罪恶活动，遭到印度尼西亚人民的坚决反对。来照硬把迫害华侨的暴行说成是“愤怒的人民大众的反应”，并且说什么这是北京电台的广播和华侨的态度和行为引起的。你们企图假借印度尼西亚“人民大众”的名义，来洗刷你们反华排华的罪责，是肯定达不到目的的。你们这种说法，是对印度尼西亚人民的莫大侮辱。
    你们所谓的“人民大众”，并不是真正的人民大众，说穿了，只不过是一小撮印度尼西亚反动分子。你们所以仇恨中国，无非是因为中国坚持反帝革命的立场。你们所以不断咒骂北京电台，无非是因为北京电台揭露了你们投靠帝国主义反共反人民的罪行。你们所以疯狂地迫害华侨，无非是因为广大华侨热爱祖国，努力发展中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊。总之，你们猖狂反华排华，是完全不得人心的，也绝对损害不了伟大的中华人民共和国，而只能暴露你们充当帝国主义反华走卒的丑恶面目。
    中国政府就送回受迫害的自愿返国的华侨问题提出的四项要求，是完全合理和正当的。印度尼西亚政府在来照中，竟然说什么它没有必要满足中国政府的要求，还提到什么华侨回国是出于中国政府的命令或政治措施。印度尼西亚外交部长马利克先生也公然宣称，印度尼西亚政府没有驱逐华侨回国，如果他们想离开印度尼西亚，一切责任必须由他们自己和建议遣返的中国政府承担。这些说法是十分荒谬的。
    举世周知，印度尼西亚政府已经把迫害华侨作为它反华政策的重要组成部分。你们有组织、有计划地制造了一系列迫害华侨的暴行，使大批世世代代居住在印度尼西亚的华侨倾家荡产，丧失生计，无法继续在印度尼西亚生存下去。在这种情况下，遭到迫害的华侨不得已而要求回国，是理所当然的。怎么能够说，这些华侨要求回国，是出于中国政府的命令和政治措施呢？又怎么能够说，印度尼西亚政府没有下令驱逐他们，就不承担责任呢？你们无论怎样狡辩，都推卸不掉你们应当承担的一切责任。
    必须指出，正处于水深火热之中的受害华侨要求回国，与在正常情况下外侨离境回国是完全不同的。这些华侨连生命财产的安全都毫无保障，又怎么能够要求他们按照正常的情况办理外侨离境的手续呢？印度尼西亚政府伪善地说它不反对华侨回国，但是又拒绝了中国政府的四项合理要求，强调要按照印度尼西亚政府的规定和条例，办理离境手续。这只能被认为是存心要对华侨回国进行刁难和阻挠。中国政府对这种阴谋不能不严加注意。
    目前，在印度尼西亚已有成千上万的受害华侨生计断绝，迫切要求回国。印度尼西亚政府既不给予他们应有的救济和安置，又拒绝安排船只把他们送回中国。中国政府对他们的命运当然不能置之不顾。中国政府再次要求印度尼西亚政府负责安排船只，把自愿返国的华侨送回中国。在印度尼西亚政府没有履行自己应负的责任之前，中国政府决定在最近期间派遣船只前往印度尼西亚，接回自愿返国的受害华侨。为此，中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府：
    一、立即停止迫害华侨，释放全部被逮捕和拘禁的华侨，切实保障华侨的生命财产的安全。
    二、保证自愿返国的华侨在前往港口途中和在港口期间的安全，在交通运输和生活方面给予必要的便利，简化他们离境的手续，并且不得阻挠他们携带自己财物和资金返回。
    三、保证中国接侨船只及其船员在进出印度尼西亚港口和在港口期间的安全，并且提供必要的协助和方便。
    为了使接运华侨回国的工作能够顺利进行，中国政府建议，两国政府立即进行具体商谈，作出妥善的安排。
    中国政府希望印度尼西亚政府对中国政府的上述要求迅速予以答复。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。

      一九六六年五月十八日
