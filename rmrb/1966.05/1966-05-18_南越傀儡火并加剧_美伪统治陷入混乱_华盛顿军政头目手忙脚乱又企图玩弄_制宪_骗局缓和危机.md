    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 17th) Saigon News: The infighting between the South Vietnamese puppet groups that erupted on the 15th is continuing to develop. The situation in major cities in the US-puppet controlled area, such as Da Nang, Hue, and Saigon, is tense and chaotic.
    According to Western news agencies, at dawn on the 17th, the puppet troops sent to Da Nang by the Nguyen Cao Ky group continued to fight against the local puppet troops belonging to the Nguyen Chanh Thi group. On the east bank of the Da Nang River, the firepower of both sides was intense. In Da Nang city, Nguyen Cao Ky's troops guarded major intersections and set up machine guns in the center of some streets. Fighter planes circled in the air. Troops opposing the Nguyen Cao Ky group continued to defend some strongholds in Da Nang city.
    Reports said that on the 16th, Buddhists in Da Nang launched a major strike and hunger strike against the Nguyen Cao Ky group. Some broadcast vehicles of the "Struggle Committee" organized by Buddhists drove through the streets of Da Nang, calling on citizens to "resist the invaders," close shops, and stop working.
    In Hue, Nguyen Chanh Thi, a political enemy of Nguyen Cao Ky, condemned Nguyen Cao Ky on the 16th for sending troops to Da Nang to take repressive actions. He called on the residents of Hue to prepare to "defend the city." The commanders of the puppet 1st and 2nd Divisions in Hue also called for large-scale opposition to the Nguyen Cao Ky regime, accusing it of "launching a civil war."
    In Saigon, the anti-Saigon "government" Buddhist leader condemned Nguyen Cao Ky on the evening of the 16th for "betraying" the Buddhists. He demanded that Nguyen Cao Ky resign immediately. He said that the Buddhists were determined to oppose the Nguyen Cao Ky group by "all means, including street demonstrations."
    Due to the chaotic situation in South Vietnam, Washington's military and political officials are frantic and very nervous. US President Johnson convened Secretary of State Rusk, Defense Secretary McNamara, and the "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Lodge, to the White House again on the 16th to discuss the crisis of infighting among the South Vietnamese puppets, and ordered Lodge to return to Saigon ahead of schedule to handle the situation. The Johnson administration, which was overwhelmed by the turmoil in South Vietnam's political situation, issued a statement through White House Press Secretary Moyers, insisting on the war of aggression against Vietnam. The statement declared that the United States would continue to play the "constitutional" trick, and would use US "influence" to "enhance the unity of all non-Communist elements in South Vietnam" and "defeat the Communist aggression."

    南越傀儡火并加剧　美伪统治陷入混乱
    华盛顿军政头目手忙脚乱又企图玩弄“制宪”骗局缓和危机
    据新华社十七日讯　西贡消息：南越傀儡集团之间十五日爆发的火并事件，正在继续发展。美伪统治区的主要城市岘港、顺化、西贡等地的局势紧张，一片混乱。
    据西方通讯社报道，十七日凌晨，阮高其集团派到岘港的伪军同属于阮正诗集团的当地伪军继续进行战斗。在岘港河东岸，双方射击的火力猛烈。在岘港市内，阮高其的军队把守着主要的十字路口，在某些街道中心架起了机关枪，战斗机在空中盘旋。反对阮高其集团的军队继续守卫着岘港市内的一些据点。
    报道说，十六日，岘港的佛教徒发动了反对阮高其集团的大罢工和绝食斗争。佛教徒组织的“斗争委员会”的一些广播车在岘港市街上开行，号召市民“抵抗入侵者”，关闭商店，停止工作。
    在顺化市，阮高其的政敌阮正诗十六日谴责阮高其派兵到岘港去采取镇压行动。他号召顺化居民准备“保卫这个城市”。伪第一师和第二师的师长在顺化也号召大规模地反对阮高其政权，指责它“发动内战”。
    在西贡市，反西贡“政府”的佛教首领十六日晚谴责阮高其“背叛”佛教徒。他要求阮高其立即辞职。他表示佛教徒决心用“包括街头示威在内的一切手段”反对阮高其集团。
    由于南越局势混乱，华盛顿的军政官员手忙脚乱，十分紧张。美国总统约翰逊十六日再次召集国务卿腊斯克、国防部长麦克纳马拉和驻南越“大使”洛奇去白宫讨论南越傀儡火并的危机，并且命令洛奇提前赶返西贡处理局势。被南越政局动荡弄得焦头烂额的约翰逊政府，由白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯发表声明，坚持侵越战争。声明宣称美国要继续玩弄“制宪”骗局，要运用美国的“影响”“增进南越一切非共产党分子的团结”，“打败共产党侵略”。
