　　听毛主席的话
　　战士　孔令洲　刘秉荣
毛主席！战士最听您的话。您说“为人民服务”，我们掏尽红心为大家。您说“愚公移山”，我们刀山火海都敢跨。您说“敌人在磨刀……”，我们时时刻刻准备打。毛主席！战士最听您的话。北京离边疆千万里，我说您就在俺连里。您的书我们天天读，您的话我们牢牢记。天天和您在一起，一个胜利紧接一个胜利。

Listen to Chairman Mao's Words
Soldiers Kong Lingzhou, Liu Bingrong
Chairman Mao! Soldiers listen to you the most. You say "Serve the People," and we give our whole heart to serve everyone. You say "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains," and we dare to cross mountains of knives and seas of fire. You say "The enemy is sharpening his knife..." and we are ready to fight at all times. Chairman Mao! Soldiers listen to you the most. Beijing is thousands of miles from the frontier, but I say you are right here in our company. We read your books every day, and we keep your words firmly in mind. Being with you every day brings one victory after another.
