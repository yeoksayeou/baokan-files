    According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Khang Khay on the 18th: Radio Pathet Lao broadcast that Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao Tripartite National Unity Government, sent an urgent telegram to the King of Laos on May 4, accusing U.S. imperialism of the barbaric crimes of using B-52 strategic bombers to bomb the liberated areas of central and lower Laos since the beginning of April.
    The telegram said that this is a very serious new "escalation" in the U.S. military conspiracy against central and lower Laos. This criminal act by the Johnson group and the U.S. stooge group in Laos once again demonstrates their deliberate intention to continue down the path of expanding the war of aggression against Laos. At the same time, this is also a conspiracy to gradually prepare for the invasion of central and lower Laos by the U.S. Army according to a predetermined plan.
    The telegram pointed out that in order to continue to serve the above-mentioned actions of U.S. imperialism to expand the war, the U.S. stooge groups in Vientiane, Bangkok, and Saigon have held meetings many times recently to discuss plans for coordinated action. At the same time, Prince Souvanna Phouma is also trying his best to echo the United States and its stooges to distort the facts and slander the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and also refuses to accept the reasonable proposals put forward by the Lao Patriotic Front aimed at gradually stabilizing the national situation. The telegram said that in order to cover up this conspiracy, Prince Phouma is doing his best to promote the idea of being "willing to hold talks with Prince Souphanouvong." Obviously, this is a very cunning trick to continue to deceive public opinion.
    According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Khang Khay on the 18th, Radio Pathet Lao broadcast on the 17th that Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao National Unity Government, and member of the Central Committee for the Supervision and Implementation of the Geneva Agreement in Laos, sent an urgent telegram to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on the 12th, strongly condemning the crimes of the United States in intensifying the use of B-52 strategic aircraft and other types of aircraft to barbarously slaughter the Lao people.
    The telegram requested the two chairmen to promptly condemn the U.S. aggressors for intensifying the use of B-52 aircraft, various types of aircraft, and napalm bombs to slaughter the Lao people, and requested the two chairmen to take appropriate measures to urge the U.S. aggressors to stop this heinous war action.

    苏发努冯亲王和冯维希分电国王和日内瓦会议两主席
    强烈谴责美帝疯狂轰炸解放区的罪行
    据新华社康开十八日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党主席、老挝三方面民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王，五月四日打紧急电报给老挝国王，控诉美帝国主义从四月初以来使用B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸老挝中寮和下寮解放区的野蛮罪行。
    电报说，这是美国对老挝中寮和下寮地区实行的军事阴谋中的一个十分严重的新的
  “升级”。约翰逊集团和美国在老挝的走狗集团的这一罪恶行动，再一次表明它们蓄意在扩大侵略老挝的战争道路上走下去。同时，这也是按照预定计划逐步准备让美国陆军侵占老挝中寮和下寮地区的一个阴谋。
    电报指出，为了继续为美帝国主义的上述扩大战争的行动服务，万象、曼谷和西贡的美国走狗集团在最近多次举行会晤，讨论配合行动的计划。同时，梭发那·富马亲王也竭力附和美国和它的走狗来歪曲事实，诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国，还拒绝接受老挝爱国战线党提出的目的在于逐步稳定国家局势的合情合理的建议。电报说，为了掩盖这一阴谋，富马亲王竭力宣扬说什么“愿意同苏发努冯亲王举行会谈”。显然，这是非常狡猾的伎俩，以便继续欺骗舆论。
    据新华社康开十八日电据巴特寮电台十七日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记、老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、老挝监察执行日内瓦协议中央委员会委员富米·冯维希十二日打紧急电报给日内瓦会议两主席，强烈谴责美国加紧使用B—52型战略飞机和其他类型的飞机野蛮地屠杀老挝人民的罪行。
    电报要求两主席及时谴责美国侵略者加紧使用B—52型飞机、各种类型的飞机和凝固汽油弹屠杀老挝人民，要求两主席采取适当的措施来促使美国侵略者停止这种罪恶滔天的战争行动。
