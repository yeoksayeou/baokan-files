    Chairman Mao teaches us that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society.
    For more than a decade, on our cultural front in Anhui, just like everywhere else in the country, there has been a black line opposing the Party and opposing socialism, standing in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought. Unless we completely eliminate this black line, socialist literature and art cannot develop healthily. We must eradicate this black line at its root and eliminate its influence on the literary and art circles of Anhui.
    In the past three years, following the teachings of the Party, large numbers of literary and art workers have studied Chairman Mao's works, gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside, thrown themselves into practical struggles, and undergone tempering, gradually changing their mental outlook, thereby bringing about an excellent situation on the cultural front of our province. Revolutionary modern dramas have occupied the stage; some good works of educational significance have emerged, especially the amateur creations of workers, peasants, and soldiers have greatly developed. A group of young amateur worker-peasant-soldier authors has emerged, creating many good works, closely cooperating with the current three great revolutionary movements, and foreshadowing the broad prospects for the development of socialist literature.
    In the future, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, go to the fiery struggle, go to the only broadest and richest source, combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, transform our thinking, improve our awareness, not for fame, not for profit, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, work steadily and practically, be a cow, a horse, and a service worker for the people for a lifetime. Only in this way can we achieve solid ideology, solid life, and solid skills. And only in this way can literary and artistic work better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serve socialism, and serve the Chinese people and the world revolution.
    I express: I must follow the instructions of the Party, stay in the countryside for a long time and wholeheartedly, learn from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, commit to revolution for a lifetime, transform my thinking for a lifetime, and be a thorough revolutionary literary and art worker.

    干一辈子革命
                   安徽省作家协会　陈登科
    毛主席教导我们，社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。
    十几年来，我们安徽的文化战线上和全国各地一样，也存在一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线，不彻底搞掉这条黑线，社会主义文艺就不可能得到健康的发展。我们一定要连根拔掉这条黑线，清除这条黑线对我们安徽文艺界的影响。
    近三年来，按照党的教导，大批文艺工作者学习毛主席著作，上山下乡，投入实际斗争，经受锻炼，逐渐改变了精神面貌，从而使我们省的文化战线出现了一片大好形势。革命现代戏占领了舞台；出现了一些有教育意义的好作品，特别是工农兵业余创作有很大的发展，涌现出一批工农兵青年业余作者，创作了许多好作品，密切配合了当前的三大革命运动，向我们预示着社会主义文学广阔的发展前景。
    今后，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，和工农兵相结合，改造思想，提高觉悟，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，踏踏实实，给人民群众当一辈子牛，当一辈子马，当一辈子勤务员，只有这样，才能做到思想过硬，生活过硬，技巧过硬。也只有这样，文艺工作才能更好地为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务，为中国人民和全世界革命服务。
    我表示：一定要遵照党的指示，长期地全身心地在农村蹲点，向工农兵群众学习，读一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想，做一个彻底的革命文艺工作者。
