    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 27th (Our Correspondent Reports) The Chinese Pavilion at the 1966 Budapest International Fair has been warmly welcomed by visitors, receiving tens of thousands of visitors every day. Since the opening of the fair on the 20th, approximately 200,000 visitors had toured the Chinese Pavilion by the 25th.

    The Chinese Pavilion's exhibit has created a sensation throughout Budapest. In and around the fairgrounds, on streets and in alleyways, men, women, and children are all talking about and praising the great achievements of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, as displayed in the Chinese Pavilion.

    Since the opening of the fair, the only place where queues have formed to see the exhibits has been inside the Chinese Pavilion. One visitor said after entering the Chinese Pavilion, "Before entering, I kept complaining that the people in front were looking too slowly, but after entering, I felt that the people behind were rushing me too much!" Some visitors looked through it once and then started again from the beginning. There were also queues at the tables for visitors to leave comments, taking turns to express their feelings in the visitor's book. On May 21st alone, 2,153 people wrote their impressions in the visitor's book. After seeing the Chinese Pavilion, they asked the Chinese staff for Chairman Mao badges and expressed their respect and love for Chairman Mao. Some said, "China has made tremendous progress in recent years, which has been achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong is wise." Others asked the Chinese staff to convey their greetings to Chairman Mao and wished him good health and longevity. An old farmer said, "China's agriculture has developed rapidly since it had cooperatives. This is thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership!" Some visitors wrote in the visitor's book, "The brilliant achievements made by the great Chinese people in socialist construction prove that the Communist Party of China and its talented leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, are implementing a correct Marxist-Leninist line and policy." "Long live the Communist Party of China and its wise leader, Comrade Mao Zedong!" "A seventy-year-old Communist pays tribute to the great Chinese people and the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "We love Mao Zedong."

    Visitors expressed their appreciation for the Chinese exhibits and their love for the Chinese people during their visit. The visitors expressed warm praise for the achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction in recent years.

    Visitors wrote in the visitor's book: "The Chinese Pavilion convincingly and indisputably proves China's tremendous economic and cultural development, proving the great strength of the People's China, a strength that causes great unease, confusion, and anxiety to the enemies of the Chinese people. At the same time, it brings great joy and encouragement to all of China's sincere friends!" "What is seen here shows the will, strength, and spiritual world of the Chinese people. Your speed of development exceeds all imagination. I wish you further success." "I have not seen a Chinese exhibition for five years, and it is now evident that the Chinese comrades have made great strides in socialist development in the past five years."

    "Your exquisite and beautiful exhibits have left us all speechless. Any praise for the exhibits is well deserved!" "China is a great country. No matter how badly some people try to portray it, it is all in vain!" Other visitors cheered in the visitor's book: "Long live the People's Republic of China, built on a solid foundation – our example!" "Long live the great Chinese Marxist-Leninist Party!"

    Many visitors congratulated the Chinese staff on the achievements made by the Chinese people. An engineer said, "I saw the Great Leap Forward in the exhibition hall." One visitor said, "China's development in a few years is equivalent to a leap forward of one hundred years. This is the Great Leap Forward." One visitor said, "China is strong mainly because of the correct leadership and the unity of everyone like one person." Another visitor said, "It was worth coming from 200 kilometers away to see the Chinese Pavilion." A chemical plant worker said, "Please convey our greetings to the Chinese people. The Hungarian working class is with you." A farmer said, "We are as happy about your achievements as if they were our own."

    Some visitors said, "The greatest honor at the fair belongs to you." "The Chinese Pavilion is the most outstanding, and such people are invincible."

    Chinese handicrafts and textiles were especially praised by the audience. Visitors commented: "Every exhibit embodies the wisdom of the Chinese people and gives a sense of beauty," "Viewing your exhibits is like a mythical artistic appreciation," "China has brought us true art."

    An industrial expert who came from a distant city praised the petroleum products, electronic instruments, and precision lathes exhibited in the Chinese Pavilion, saying, "As a Communist, I am genuinely happy to see such outstanding achievements."

    The general audience was very encouraged after witnessing the current achievements of China's socialist construction. They said: "We Hungarians know too little about China. There are very few reports about China in the newspapers, and when there is one, it often says bad things about China." "We really want to know about China, but there is no way to know." "We have only heard about how backward, hungry, poor, and bellicose China is." "Everything we see here is completely different from what we usually read in the newspapers." One visitor said, "The Chinese Pavilion has played a real role in promoting Marxism-Leninism. Revisionists will not succeed in belittling China. China's development refutes all the rumors and slanders against China." In order to deepen their understanding of China, many visitors also asked the Chinese staff a variety of questions with great eagerness.

    A very small number of people raised provocative questions or made defamatory remarks in the visitor's book, slandering China as "starving," "bellicose," "you are a minority," etc. One "visitor" wrote abusive words against China in the visitor's book and then fled in a hurry. Later, a Hungarian young woman saw it, trembled with anger, and said to the Chinese staff, "This person cannot represent us Hungarian people. The person who wrote these words is a bastard." Other visitors present also said, "Your pavilion has received the highest praise. The person who wrote these words is a bad egg!"

    Some visitors from other countries also expressed warm congratulations to the Chinese staff. An Lao student said: "You have made great achievements in recent years. Some countries say bad things about you and do not report on the situation in China in the newspapers. Your exhibition shows that your achievements are great and the people can see it clearly." A Cameroonian student said: "For us Africans, your achievements show us how we should fight and build our country." A Soviet visitor said in the visitor's book: "Greetings! I am sincerely happy for the great, hardworking, and intelligent Chinese people." A Czechoslovak designer said: "China's development is very rapid, and Mao Zedong is a wise leader." A Greek visitor said: "I have seen your great achievements. Today, the existence of socialist China is an immeasurable piece of good fortune for the progressive humanity of the world!"

    修正主义者要贬低和污蔑中国是办不到的
    新华社布达佩斯二十七日电　本社记者报道：参加一九六六年布达佩斯国际博览会的中国馆，受到观众的热烈欢迎，每天都接待数万观众。博览会从二十日开幕以来，到二十五日就约有二十万观众参观了中国展览馆。
    中国馆的展出已经轰动整个布达佩斯。在博览会的场地内外，街头巷尾，男女老少都在纷纷谈论和赞扬中国馆所显示出来的中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下所取得的伟大成就。
    博览会开幕以来，唯有中国馆内出现排队争看展品的情况。一位观众进了中国馆后说：“没有进馆时老嫌前面的人看得太慢，可是进了馆以后又嫌后面的人催的太紧！”有的观众看完一遍又从头看起。在观众留言的桌子旁也有人排队，依次在留言簿上表达自己的观感。单是五月二十一日这一天就有二千一百五十三人在留言簿上写下了观感。他们在看了中国馆之后向中国工作人员索要毛主席象纪念章，并倾吐自己对毛主席敬爱的心情。他们有的说，“中国这几年来有了巨大的发展，这是在毛泽东主席领导下取得的，毛泽东是英明的”，有的要中国工作人员转达对毛主席的问候，并祝他健康长寿。一位老农民说：“中国的农业有了合作社以后就迅速发展起来，这是毛泽东主席领导的好！”有的观众在留言簿上写道：“伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，证明了中国共产党和它的天才的领袖毛泽东同志执行的是正确的马克思列宁主义的路线政策”“中国共产党及其英明的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！”“一个七十岁的共产党人向伟大的中国人民和伟大的中国共产党致敬！”“毛泽东万岁！”“我们热爱毛泽东”。
    观众们在参观时表达了他们对中国展品的赞赏和对中国人民的热爱。观众们对中国人民这几年来在社会主义建设中所取得的成就表示热烈的赞扬。
    观众在留言簿上写道：“中国馆以令人信服的事实无可辩驳地证明了中国巨大的经济和文化发展，证明了人民中国的伟大力量，这个力量能使中国人民的敌人感到极大不安、混乱和忧虑。同时使中国所有的真诚朋友感到极大的欢欣鼓舞！”“在这里看到的东西显示了中国人民的意志、力量和精神世界，你们的发展速度超出了一切想象，祝你们取得进一步的成就”。“我已五年没有看到中国的展览了，现在证明中国同志在过去五年中在社会主义的发展中大踏步的前进了。”
  “你们精致美好的展品把我们都看呆了，对展品的任何赞扬都是可以当之无愧的！”“中国是一个伟大的国家，不管有些人把它说得如何坏，都是徒劳的！”还有的观众在留言簿上欢呼：“建立在坚强基础上的中华人民共和国——我们的榜样万岁！”“伟大的中国马克思列宁主义的党万岁！”
    许多观众在参观时向中国工作人员表示祝贺中国人民所取得的成就。一位工程师说：“我在展览馆中看到了中国的大跃进。”一个观众说，“中国几年的发展等于飞跃了一百年，这是大跃进。”一个观众说，“中国之所以强大，主要是领导的正确，大家团结的象一个人一样。”另一位观众说：“为了看中国馆，我从二百公里以外赶来也是值得的。”一位化工厂工人说：“请转达我们对中国人民的问候，匈牙利工人阶级和你们在一起。”一位农民说：“我们把你们的成就看作是自己的成就一样高兴。”
    有的观众说，“博览会上最大的荣誉是属于你们的”“中国馆是最杰出的，这样的人民是不可战胜的。”
    中国的手工艺品和纺织品更是受到观众赞美不绝。观众留言说：“每一件展品都体现着中国人民的智慧，给人以美的感觉”，“看你们的展品是一种神话般的艺术欣赏”，“中国给我们带来了真正的艺术”。
    一位从外城赶来的工业专家对中国馆展出的石油产品、电子仪器和精密车床赞美不绝，他说：“我作为一个共产党员，看到你们这样卓越的成就感到由衷的高兴”。
    广大观众通过展览亲眼看到目前中国社会主义建设成就后感到十分欢欣鼓舞。他们说：“我们匈牙利人对中国了解太少了，报上介绍中国的消息很少，偶尔有一篇也是说中国坏话的。”“我们很想了解中国，但是没有办法了解”；“我们听说的只是中国如何落后、饥饿、贫穷、好战”；“这里看到的一切同我们平时在报上读到的完全不一样”。一位观众说，“中国馆起到了真正的宣传马克思列宁主义的作用，修正主义者要贬低中国是办不到的。中国的发展很好地驳斥了对中国的一切造谣污蔑”。为了加深对中国的了解，许多观众还怀着极其迫切的心情，向中国工作人员提出各种各样的问题要求解答。
    也有极个别的人提出挑衅性问题或在留言簿上进行诽谤，污蔑中国“挨饿”、“好战”，“你们是少数”等等。一个“观众”在留言簿上写了谩骂中国的字样后即仓惶溜去，后来被一位匈牙利女青年看到，气得她双手发抖，并对中国人员说，“这个人不能代表我们匈牙利人民，写这样话的人是混蛋。”在场的其他观众也说，“你们馆获得了最高的好评，写这样话的人是个坏蛋！”
    一些其他国家的观众也向中国人员表示热烈祝贺，一位老挝的留学生说：“这几年来你们取得了巨大成绩，有些国家说你们的坏话，在报纸上又不报道中国的情况。你们的展览说明了你们的成绩是巨大的，人民是看得清楚的。”一位喀麦隆的留学生说：“对我们非洲人来说，你们的成就说明了我们应该怎样斗争和建设我们的国家。”一位苏联观众在留言簿上说：“致敬！为伟大、勤劳、智慧的中国人民感到由衷的高兴。”一位捷克斯洛伐克设计师说：“中国的发展是飞快的，毛泽东是位英明的领袖。”一位希腊观众说：“我看到了你们的伟大成就。今天社会主义中国的存在，是世界进步人类的不可衡量的幸运！”（附图片）
