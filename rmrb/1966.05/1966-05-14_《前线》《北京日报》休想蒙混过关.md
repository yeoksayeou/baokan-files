    *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* Should Not Think They Can Muddle Through
    The Party is our father and mother, socialism is our life. Anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who oppose socialism will inevitably be crushed and bleed.
    Wu Xingchun, Delegate to the National People's Congress, First-Class Merit Citation Recipient, Kunming Military Region

    Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist double-talk is filled with deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, and it also exposes Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy to dig up the foundations of socialism and attempt to realize capitalist restoration in our country. As a people's soldier, I must resolutely fight back. Defending the Party that nurtured us, defending the socialist victory we achieved through hard work, is the sacred task of our people's soldiers. We want to warn Deng Tuo that the Party is our father and mother, socialism is our life, and whoever opposes socialism will be crushed and bleed!
    Deng Tuo and his small clique of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements viciously attack our Party, attack socialism, arrogantly call for our Party to step down and "rest," and attack our Three Red Banners as "bragging" and "wishful thinking." No matter what tricks they play, their only goal is to abolish the Party's leadership and try every possible way to restore capitalism in our country. This is wishful thinking! We have had enough of the miserable life of the old society. In that kind of society, where was the place for us poor people? All we had was the life of beasts of burden. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the manor of Liu Wencai, the landlord of Dayi County in Sichuan. Seeing his private water prison, with sharp triangular nails set in waist-deep water, I was reminded of the dark days of the old society. In Chongqing, we also visited the Zhazidong prison. Seeing the vicious means used by the reactionaries and the cruel torture suffered by the martyrs, we could not help but shed tears. Today, we are already living a happy life. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are working diligently on all fronts, for the sake of building socialism better, carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end, and realizing socialism and communism throughout the world. Deng Tuo wants us to regress in the revolution, and we firmly refuse!
    From the means by which Deng Tuo and his small clique of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements launched their attack on our Party, I realize that today's class enemies are even more cunning and insidious in the face of our solid proletarian dictatorship. Some of them wave "red flags" to oppose the red flag; some of them beat around the bush, making indirect attacks; some of them hang up a sheep's head and sell dog meat; some of them come from the outside, and some of them attack from the inside. However, no matter what tricks they play, their reactionary political features will always be exposed; paper cannot wrap fire. The Party often teaches us to recognize the unchanging essence of class enemies and respond to their ever-changing tactics. Today, *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* are engaging in sham criticism and sham struggle, just like Wu Han's sham self-criticism, trying to slip through, muddle through, so as to preserve their strength and make a comeback in the future. We must not be fooled by them.

    《前线》《北京日报》休想蒙混过关
    党是我们的爹娘，社会主义是我们的生命。反党反社会主义分子要反对社会主义，就一定会碰得头破血流
    全国人民代表大会代表、昆明部队一等功臣　吴兴春
    邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话中，无处不充满了对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨，也无处不暴露了邓拓反党反社会主义，挖社会主义墙脚，企图在我国实现资本主义复辟的阴谋。作为一个人民战士，我要坚决回击。保卫哺育我们的党，保卫我们艰苦奋斗取得的社会主义胜利，是我们人民战士的神圣任务。我们要正告邓拓，党是我们的爹娘，社会主义是我们的生命，谁要反对社会主义，谁就会碰得头破血流！
    邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子恶毒地攻击我们的党，攻击社会主义，狂妄地叫我们党下台“休息”，攻击我们的三面红旗是“吹牛皮”、“想入非非”。不管他们耍些什么花招，目的只有一个，就是要取消党的领导，千方百计让资本主义在我国复辟。这是在白日作梦！旧社会的苦难生活，我们已经过够了，在那种社会里，哪有我们穷苦人的地位，有的只是牛马生活。最近，我有机会到四川去参观了大邑县大地主刘文彩的地主庄园。看到他私设水牢，没腰深的水里还设有锋利的三角钉，我又想起了旧社会的黑暗日子。在重庆，我们又参观了渣滓洞。看看反动派使用的毒辣手段，看看烈士们遭受的酷刑，我们都不禁掉下泪来。今天，我们已经过着幸福的生活。全国人民在党的领导下，在各条战线上辛勤劳动，为的就是更好地建设社会主义，把无产阶级革命进行到底，在全世界实现社会主义和共产主义。邓拓却要我们革命倒退，我们坚决不答应！
    从邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子向我党发起进攻的手段中，我认识到，今天的阶级敌人在我们牢固的无产阶级专政面前，是更加狡猾了，更加阴险了。他们有的是打着“红旗”反红旗；有的是指桑骂槐，旁敲侧击；有的是挂羊头、卖狗肉；有的是从外部来，有的是从内部攻。但是，不管他们耍什么花招，其反动的政治面目总是要暴露出来的，纸是包不住火的。党经常教导我们，对待阶级敌人要识其不变，应其万变。今天，《前线》和《北京日报》搞什么假批判，假斗争，正象吴晗搞假检讨一样，是想滑过去，蒙混过关，以便保存实力，日后东山再起。我们决不能上他的当。
