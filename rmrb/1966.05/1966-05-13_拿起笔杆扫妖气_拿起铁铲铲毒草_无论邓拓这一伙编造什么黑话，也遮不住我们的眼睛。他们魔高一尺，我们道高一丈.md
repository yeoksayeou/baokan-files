    Raise the Pen to Sweep Away Evil Spirits, Pick Up the Shovel to Uproot Poisonous Weeds
    No matter what dark language Deng Tuo and his gang concoct, they cannot obscure our eyes. If they are one foot tall in demonry, we are ten feet tall in righteousness.
    Shenyang
    The broad masses of workers in Shenyang actively participate in the struggle to criticize the "Three-Family Village."
    The worker masses say that in the socialist industrial revolution, we are the main force; in the socialist cultural revolution, we are also the main force. We want to speak, we want to write articles, pick up our pens and sweep away those demons and monsters, pick up our shovels and uproot poisonous weeds, and clear away the poisonous fog and dust spread by the "Three-Family Village."
    At various forums in Shenyang, the broad masses of workers use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, citing a large number of vivid facts to powerfully counter Deng Tuo's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism.
    Wang Feng'en, a famous labor model and worker-engineer at the Shenyang Transformer Factory, said: "After seeing Deng Tuo and his gang's evil words and deeds in attacking the Party, I am very angry. No matter what dark language they concoct, they cannot obscure our eyes. If they are one foot tall in demonry, we are ten feet tall in righteousness. Even if he drags out dead cats and rotten dogs like Wang Anshi and other emperors and generals, it will not save his life. No matter what cloak he wears, we must strip it off and expose his true colors. The things he says are the words of landlords and counter-revolutionaries."
    Wei Fengying, a deputy to the National People's Congress and worker at the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory, said, "Deng Tuo viciously attacks our great Party, saying that our Party's leadership is 'self-righteous and looks down on the masses.' This is simply nonsense, turning black and white upside down. Our Party's leadership trusts and relies on the masses the most. As a poor child who picked up coal kernels and dug wild vegetables in the old society, I am now able to participate in discussing and formulating major national plans under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. How can it be said that our Party's leadership looks down on the masses? Our Party has always regarded the people as the most valuable asset of society, the driving force for creating the world, transforming the world, and promoting the progress of the world."
    Wu Dayou, an activist in technical cooperation and a worker-technician at the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, said: After reading Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist dark words in the newspaper, my lungs are about to explode with anger. Deng Tuo's so-called dark words of "self-righteous and looks down on the masses" are a poisonous arrow aimed at our Party, trying to injure our flesh-and-blood relationship with the Party, which is absolutely impossible. We can see at a glance that Deng Tuo's so-called "extensive consultation with the public" and "accepting the strategies of subordinates" of people like Kuang Heng and Zheng Xing, although seemingly valuing the masses, are actually only serving the feudal emperors by devising plans for "harmony in the world," deceiving the people, and ruling the people. Put away your false cleverness and petty tricks, we will never be deceived by Deng Tuo's lies. The more you try to alienate us, the more we will stand with the Party; the more you fear that we are of one heart with the Party, the more we will be of one heart with the Party; the more you fear that our hearts are toward the Party, the more we will follow the Party, not only following the Party to build socialism, but also following the Party to build communism, forever following the Party, following Chairman Mao, and carrying the revolution through to the end.
    Zhang Shaolin, an old worker at the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory and a municipal Five-Good pacesetter, said: After listening to the broadcast of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, I was very angry. He said that our Party did not care for labor during the Great Leap Forward, which is a complete and utter slander. I can cite many facts to refute them. In 1958, in order to change our country's state of poverty and blankness as soon as possible and compete with imperialism for time, creating more property for the country, we were willing to rest less, but the leaders repeatedly asked us to go back and rest. We secretly sneaked back, because we had become masters of the country, and production was entirely for ourselves. In my riveting team, before 1958, most of the work was heavy physical labor. Under the care of the Party, we made great efforts in technical innovation and technical revolution, and now more than 90% of the work has been mechanized. Deng Tuo, from what point do you say that our Party does not care for labor?
    Duan Mingzhi, a Shenyang Five-Good pacesetter and political instructor of the Wired Telegraph Section of the Shenyang Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau, said: Deng Tuo arrogantly shouted that we should "not say anything, not do anything," this is Deng Tuo dreaming! Deng Tuo shamelessly said, "Forced speech and action will cause trouble, and it is necessary to ask a brilliant doctor for guidance." May I ask Deng Tuo, who is your so-called brilliant doctor? Aren't they just you anti-Party and anti-socialist elements? No, you are not our "brilliant doctors," but our most ferocious enemies. You attempt to make us "rest" and "step down," so that you can exercise dictatorship over us. This is absolutely impossible. We must firmly grasp the guns in our hands and defend the great Party and the proletarian dictatorship.

### 拿起笔杆扫妖气　拿起铁铲铲毒草  无论邓拓这一伙编造什么黑话，也遮不住我们的眼睛。他们魔高一尺，我们道高一丈

    拿起笔杆扫妖气　拿起铁铲铲毒草
    无论邓拓这一伙编造什么黑话，也遮不住我们的眼睛。他们魔高一尺，我们道高一丈
    沈阳
    沈阳市广大工人群众，积极参加批判“三家村”的斗争。
    工人群众说，在社会主义的工业大革命中，我们是主力军；在社会主义的文化大革命中，我们也是主力军。我们要说话，我们要写文章，拿起笔杆，扫荡那些牛鬼蛇神，拿起铁铲铲去毒草，澄清“三家村”散布的毒雾迷尘。
    沈阳市广大职工在各种座谈会上，都用毛泽东思想做武器，举出大量活生生的事实，有力地反击了邓拓反党、反社会主义的罪行。
    沈阳市著名劳动模范、沈阳变压器厂工人工程师王凤恩说：“看了邓拓一伙向党进攻的罪恶言行，非常气愤。无论他们编造什么黑话，也遮不住我们的眼睛。他们魔高一尺，我们道高一丈。他把王安石等帝王将相这些死猫烂狗抬出来，也救不了他的命。不管他披着什么外衣，也要扒下来，叫他现出原形。他说的那些话，就是地主、反革命分子说的话。
    全国人民代表大会代表、东北机器制造厂工人尉凤英说“邓拓恶毒的攻击我们伟大的党，说我们党的领导是‘自作聪明，看不起群众’。这简直是胡说八道，颠倒黑白。我们党的领导是最相信群众，依靠群众的。我这个在旧社会拣煤核、挖野菜的穷孩子，今天在党和毛主席的领导下，能够参加讨论制定国家计划的大事，这怎么能说我们党的领导看不起群众呢？我们党从来都是把人民群众当作社会最宝贵的财富，创造世界、改造世界、推动世界前进的动力。”
    沈阳市技术协作积极分子、沈阳高压开关厂工人技术员吴大有说：我看了报上登载的邓拓反党反社会主义黑话以后，肺要气炸了。邓拓的所谓“自作聪明，看不起群众”的黑话，就是向我们党放了一支毒箭，要想中伤我们和党的血肉关系，这是绝对办不到的。我们一眼就可以看出，邓拓所说的匡衡、郑兴之流的“广谋丛众”“纳群下之策”，好象是看得起群众，其实也不过是为“合于天下”，替封建皇帝出谋划策，欺骗人民，统治人民。收起你这个假聪明和小聪明吧，我们决不受邓拓的鬼话的欺骗。你越是想离间我们，我们越是和党站在一起；你越是害怕我们和党一条心，我们就越要和党心贴心；你越害怕我们心向党，我们就越是跟党走，不仅跟着党建设社会主义，而且还要跟党建设共产主义，永远跟着党，跟着毛主席，革命到底。
    沈阳气体压缩机厂老工人、市五好标兵张绍林说：我听了邓拓反党反社会主义言论的广播后，非常气愤。他说我们党在大跃进中不爱护劳动力，这是彻头彻尾的污蔑，我可以举出许多事实回击他们。一九五八年，我们为了尽快改变我国的一穷二白面貌，同帝国主义争时间，多为国家创造一分财产，我们宁愿少休息点，领导却一再叫我们回去休息，我们又偷偷地溜回来，因为我们做了国家的主人，生产完全是为了自己。我所在的铆工组，一九五八年前大多是笨体力劳动，在党的关怀下我们大闹技术革新、技术革命，到现在百分之九十以上实现了机械化。邓拓，你从哪点说我们党不爱护劳动力呢？
    沈阳市五好标兵、沈阳市长途电信局有线报务科政治指导员段明志说：邓拓狂妄地叫喊要我们“什么话也不要说，什么事也不要做”，这是邓拓在作梦！邓拓还不知耻地说：“勉强说话做事就会出乱子，需要请高明医师指导”。请问邓拓，你所谓的高明的医师是谁？不就是你们这些反党反社会主义分子吗？不，你们不是我们的“高明的医师”，而是我们的最凶恶的敌人，你们企图要我们“休息”、“下台”，让你们来专我们的政，这绝对办不到，我们一定要紧握手中枪，保卫伟大的党，保卫无产阶级专政。
