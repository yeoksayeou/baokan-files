    Hanoi, May 22 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the South Vietnam Liberation Radio: Commanders of the Liberation Armed Forces in the eastern region of South Vietnam (including provinces such as Dike, Go Cong, Gia Dinh, Thu Dau Mot, Ba Ria, Tay Ninh, and Bien Hoa) recently spoke to reporters from the *Liberation Army Daily* about the major victories achieved by the military and civilians in this region in defeating the "Dry Season Offensive" of the American bandits and their lackeys.

    He said that in November 1965, the U.S. aggressors, in order to salvage their predicament in South Vietnam, dispatched a large number of troops, including the entire U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the infantry battalion of the Australian puppet troops, and most of the puppet army's 5th Division, to launch a large-scale "mopping-up" operation against the so-called "Iron Triangle of the Viet Cong," namely the D Zone, and the southern and northern regions of Dau Tieng. However, after more than five months of intense fighting, the enemy's dry season sweep suffered a complete defeat.

    He said that in the five months of the dry season battles, the military and civilians in the eastern region of the south killed, wounded, and captured nearly 20,000 enemies, including nearly 9,000 U.S. aggressor troops and accomplice troops, and completely annihilated 17 enemy battalions, including 9 battalions of U.S. aggressor troops.

    The commander pointed out that this vivid fact shattered all the enemy's illusions about the "Dry Season Offensive."

    He said that after five months of fierce fighting, we have clearly seen the weaknesses of the American bandits and our own enormous strength, and thus concluded that no matter how many troops the enemy sends and what brutal war methods they adopt, as long as we have a high degree of hatred for the enemy and an iron-like fighting will, and fully unleash the power of people's war, we will definitely be able to defeat the enemy.

    He emphasized that in the future, U.S. imperialism will continue to intensify its war of aggression. However, even if it doubles or triples the number of troops in the eastern region of the south, no matter what brutal and insidious means it adopts, based on our own personal experience and the experience of all the military and civilians in the south, we can firmly believe that no matter how many difficulties we have to overcome, what type of war we have to deal with, or how long we have to fight, the military and civilians in the eastern region of the south must, together with all the military and civilians in the south, thoroughly defeat the U.S. imperialist war of aggression.

    Saigon, May 23 (Xinhua) -- South Vietnamese Liberation Army recently delivered a heavy blow to the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division in the An Khe area of Gia Lai Province in South Vietnam, inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. aggressor troops.

    According to Western news agencies, a brigade of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division launched a so-called "Operation Crazy Horse" in the An Khe area starting on the 16th. Reports revealed that after the U.S. "Crazy Horse" left its nest, it has been continuously attacked by the Liberation Army, which "appears extraordinarily brave and has good equipment such as automatic weapons and mortars."

    Reports revealed that the spokesman of the U.S. troops invading Vietnam admitted that in the seven days of fighting up to the 22nd, the U.S. aggressor troops suffered repeated defeats, with some aggressor troops suffering "moderate casualties" or "heavy casualties."

    Western news agencies also reported that on the morning of the 22nd, the South Vietnam Liberation Army attacked the Thu Duc Marine Corps Training Center of the puppet regime, about 16 kilometers north of Saigon, killing and wounding 40 puppet troops. The report said that the attack "began when the Viet Cong detonated a landmine at this training center." "The Viet Cong then attacked with grenades and small arms."

    南越南部东区人民武装粉碎美帝“旱季攻势”歼灭美军及帮凶军九千
    充分发挥人民战争威力定能彻底打败美帝
    安溪地区美军骑一师发动进攻遭到解放军迎头痛击伤亡惨重
    新华社河内二十二日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方南部东区（包括堤岸、鹅贡、嘉定、土龙木、巴地、西宁和边和等省）解放武装力量指挥员，最近对《解放军报》记者畅谈这个区的军民打败美国强盗及其走狗的“旱季攻势”所取得的重大胜利。
    他说，美国侵略者为了挽救它们在越南南方的困境，在一九六五年十一月份出动大批军队，其中包括整个美国第一步兵师和第一七三空降旅、澳大利亚仆从军的步兵营和伪军第五师的大部分军队，对所谓“越共的铁三角”的Ｄ战区和油汀南部和北部地区，发动了大规模的“扫荡”，但是，经过五个多月的严重较量，敌人的旱季扫荡遭到了彻底的失败。
    他说，在旱季五个月的战斗中，南部东区军民共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人近二万名，其中有美国侵略军和帮凶军近九千名，全歼敌人十七个营，其中有美国侵略军九个营。
    这位指挥员指出，这一生动的事实，粉碎了敌人对“旱季攻势”抱有的一切幻想。
    他说，经过五个月的激烈战斗，使我们看清了美国强盗的弱点和自己的巨大力量，从而得出结论，这就是无论敌人增派多少军队，采用什么残暴的战争手段，只要我们具有对敌人的高度仇恨和钢铁般的战斗意志，充分发挥人民战争的威力，就一定可以战胜敌人。
    他强调说，今后，美帝国主义还要继续加强侵略战争。但是，即使它把南部东区的军队再增加一倍、两倍，无论它采用什么残暴和阴险的手段，我们根据自己的切身经验和全体南方军民的经验，可以坚定地相信：无论要克服多少困难，要对付什么类型的战争，要打多长时间，南部东区军民一定要同全体南方军民一起，彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略战争。
    新华社二十三日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放军最近在越南南方嘉莱省安溪地区痛击美国第一骑兵师，美国侵略军伤亡很大。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国第一骑兵师的一个旅，从十六日开始，在安溪地区发动了一个所谓“疯马行动”。报道透露，美国“疯马”出巢后，连日来不断遭到“看来异乎寻常地勇猛，并且有着自动武器和迫击炮等很好的装备”的解放军的袭击。
    报道透露，侵越美军发言人承认，到二十二日为止的七天战斗中，美国侵略军连吃败仗，有的侵略军遭到“中等程度的伤亡”，或者“很重的伤亡”。
    西方通讯社还报道说，南越解放军二十二日清晨，袭击了西贡以北约十六公里的守德伪海军陆战队训练中心，打死、打伤伪军四十名。报道说，这次袭击是解放军“在这个训练中心爆炸一枚地雷时开始的”。“越共接着用手榴弹和小型武器进行袭击。”
