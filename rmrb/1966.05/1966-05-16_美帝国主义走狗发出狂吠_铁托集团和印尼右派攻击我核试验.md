    American Imperialist Lackeys Howl Madly
    Tito Clique and Indonesian Rightists Attack Our Nuclear Test
    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Belgrade News: The American imperialist lackeys, the Yugoslav Tito traitor clique, are deeply disturbed by the success of China's third nuclear test and are engaging in frantic anti-China clamor.
    The Yugoslav newspaper *Borba* published a commentary on the 12th, saying that China's "efforts to catch up with the highest achievements in nuclear technology are particularly disturbing in their speed." The commentary slanderously claimed that "China's approach clearly starts from extending the 'balance of terror,' a major factor in international relations," and that "this attitude is extremely dangerous."
    This newspaper openly defended American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist clique, dismissing China's declared purpose of conducting nuclear tests to oppose the US-Soviet collusion in implementing nuclear monopoly and undermining the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, as "absurd accusations."
    The commentary, reversing black and white, slanderously claimed that China's use of nuclear weapons "as a means of blackmail and exerting pressure can only become a source of increasingly intense international nervousness and tension, and may become a direct threat to peace."
    Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: Jakarta News: The Indonesian right-wing military regime and its propaganda tools viciously attack China's nuclear tests.
    According to a report by Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) Radio, the Deputy Prime Minister Ruslan Abdulgani, responsible for atomic energy issues in the right-wing military regime, said on the 11th that China's nuclear explosion was a "threat to world peace." He also incited: "Due to this nuclear test, the Indonesian people should increasingly strengthen their vigilance against Communist China."
    Abdulgani took the opportunity to tout the Geneva 17-Nation Disarmament Conference, where the US and the Soviet Union are conducting "preventing nuclear proliferation" deal, saying: "In order to achieve world peace, every effort must be made to make the disarmament conference in Geneva a success."
    The official-controlled Jakarta Radio on the 11th even distorted the successful Chinese nuclear explosion in a slanderous tone as "a psychological warfare activity in which China bared its fangs and claws at the Indonesian nation," and that China "attempted to scare Indonesia with this new explosion."
    The *Indonesian Herald*, controlled by the right-wing military regime's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also published an editorial on the same day, using the words of imperialists to sow discord between China and other Asian and African countries, saying that the success of the Chinese nuclear explosion was "a political and psychological threat" to Asian and African countries.
    The Jakarta right-wing newspaper *Social Courier* published an editorial on the 12th, attacking China's third nuclear test as "an incorrect action." The editorial also expressed "regret" over China's refusal to sign the Moscow Treaty, which was concocted by the US and the Soviet Union to monopolize nuclear weapons and dominate the world.

    美帝国主义走狗发出狂吠
    铁托集团和印尼右派攻击我核试验
    新华社十五日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：美帝国主义的走狗、南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团对中国第三次核试验的成功深感不安，并且大肆进行反华叫嚣。
    南斯拉夫《战斗报》十二日发表评论说，中国“努力要赶上核技术的最高成就，其速度使人特别感到不安”。评论诬蔑“中国的方针显然是从延长恐惧平衡这个国际关系中的主要因素出发的”，“这种态度是极端危险的”。
    这家报纸公然为美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义集团辩护，把中国所宣布的进行核试验是为了反对美苏勾结实行核垄断、破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，说成是“荒谬的指责”。
    评论颠倒黑白地诬蔑中国把核武器“作为进行讹诈和施加压力的手段，只能成为国际上越来越剧烈的神经过敏和紧张局势的根源，并且可能成为对和平的直接威胁。”
    新华社十四日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权和它的宣传工具恶毒地攻击中国的核试验。
    据日本广播协会电台报道，在右派军人政权中负责原子能问题的副总理鲁斯兰·阿卜杜加尼十一日把中国的核爆炸说成是“威胁世界和平”。他还煽动说：“由于这次核试验，印度尼西亚国民应该愈益加强对共产党中国的警惕”。
    阿卜杜加尼乘机吹捧美苏正在进行“防止核扩散”交易的日内瓦十七国裁军会议，说：“为了实现世界和平，必须进行一切努力，使日内瓦的裁军会议成功”。
    官方控制的雅加达电台十一日居然以诬蔑的口吻把中国核爆炸成功歪曲成为“一次向印度尼西亚民族张牙舞爪的心理战活动”，中国“试图用这次新的爆炸来吓唬印度尼西亚”。
    由右派军人政权外交部控制的《印度尼西亚先驱报》当天也发表社论，使用了帝国主义者挑拨中国和其它亚非国家的言词，说什么中国核爆炸成功是对亚非国家的“一种政治上和心理上的威胁”。
    雅加达右派报纸《社会使者报》十二日发表社论，攻击中国进行第三次核试验是“不正确的行动”。社论还对中国拒绝在美苏为了垄断核武器主宰世界而炮制出来的莫斯科条约上签字，表示“遗憾”。
