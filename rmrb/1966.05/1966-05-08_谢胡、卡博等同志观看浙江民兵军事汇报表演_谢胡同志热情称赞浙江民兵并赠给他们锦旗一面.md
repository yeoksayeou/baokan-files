    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 7th - The entire Albanian Party and Government delegation headed by Comrade Shehu watched the Zhejiang militia representative's military reporting performance in Hangzhou this afternoon. Comrade Shehu praised the Zhejiang militia's good results in military training and the victories achieved in the struggle against the enemy.

    Comrade Li Xiannian, Comrade Jiang Hua and others accompanied the distinguished guests to watch the performance.

    Thirty-seven male and female militiamen participated in the reporting performance, some from islands, others from rural areas and factories. Among them were militia combat heroes who had performed meritorious service in the struggle against the enemy, militia sharpshooters, and "Five-Good" militiamen. They all reported to Comrade Shehu and other distinguished Albanian guests with a sense of infinite honor.

    At 3:30 pm, signal flares flew into the sky, and the performance began. Six female militiamen aimed at thirty balloons 100 meters away in a prone position, quickly firing, and every shot hit the target, all thirty balloons were hit. Comrades Shehu, Kambo and others applauded warmly, praising them for quickly and accurately eliminating the "enemy." The flamethrower performance began, five militiamen carried flamethrowers on their backs, lying on the ground, firing streams of fire at the "enemy bunker" and group targets dozens of meters away, and the fire raged instantly, and the "enemy bunker" and "enemy" were destroyed together. Next, male and female militiamen used semi-automatic rifles to perform rapid mobile shooting at steel plate targets and fixed rapid shooting at bullseye targets, and each militiaman hit the target with every shot, achieving excellent results. Four target reporters carried the bullseye target and ran to Comrades Shehu and Kambo, asking the distinguished Albanian guests to inspect the shooting results. Comrade Shehu and other distinguished guests stood up and looked at the hit rate of each target, praising the female militiaman, Wang Yuexia, a well-known sharpshooter in the province, and other militiamen for their excellent shooting.

    The performance of shooting at aerial targets by thirty-two male and female militiamen left a good impression on the distinguished guests. When "enemy paratroopers" appeared in the sky that day, the militiamen quickly dispersed and hid themselves, using semi-automatic rifles, submachine guns, and light machine guns to form a fierce and dense network of fire, hitting the target in a few minutes. When several militiamen sent the paratrooper target with bullet holes all over its body to Comrades Shehu and others, Comrade Shehu took the target, looked at it again and again, and said excitedly: It's smashed! It's smashed!

    After the reporting performance, male and female militiamen lined up in front of the stands, and Comrades Shehu, Kambo and others met with all the militiamen and cordially shook hands with them one by one to congratulate them. After the meeting, Comrades Shehu, Kambo and other distinguished guests, together with Comrades Li Xiannian, Jiang Hua and others, walked into the ranks of the militia, and took photos with the militiamen hand in hand. Comrade Shehu also took a group photo with the female militiamen who participated in the reporting performance. He said he would take this photo to the Albanian female militiamen.

    Before bidding farewell to the militiamen, Comrade Shehu presented a banner to the Zhejiang militia, and he said enthusiastically: "On behalf of the Albanian militia, I present this banner to you. This red flag symbolizes the fresh blood shed by the Albanian people in the revolutionary struggle, the five stars on the flag represent socialism, and the double-headed eagle on the flag illustrates two meanings, that is, Albania has been fighting on two fronts in the past and present, on the one hand, maintaining a high degree of vigilance against foreign enemies, and if they dare to attack, we will eliminate them; on the other hand, it means that we are fighting to prevent the restoration of revisionism and capitalism in the country." The militia instructor took the banner and thanked Comrade Shehu for his kind concern. He said: "Our Zhejiang militia, under the education of Chairman Mao's thought of people's war, will resolutely make all preparations to oppose American imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism!" Then, he and the militiamen who participated in the performance shouted together: "Long live Comrade Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Welcome Comrade Shehu!" "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!" and other slogans. At this time, Comrades Shehu and Kambo came over, shook hands with him, and hugged him tightly. (Attached photo)

    Comrade Shehu and others were warmly welcomed by the masses when they arrived in Hangzhou.

    谢胡、卡博等同志观看浙江民兵军事汇报表演
    谢胡同志热情称赞浙江民兵并赠给他们锦旗一面
    新华社杭州七日电　以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，今天下午在杭州观看了浙江民兵代表军事汇报表演。谢胡同志称赞浙江民兵军事训练的良好成绩和对敌斗争中所取得的胜利。
    李先念同志、江华同志等陪同贵宾观看了表演。
    参加汇报表演的有三十七名男女民兵，他们有的来自海岛，有的来自农村和工厂。他们中有在对敌斗争中立过战功的民兵战斗英雄，有的是民兵神枪手，有的是“五好”民兵。他们都怀着无限荣幸的心情向谢胡同志等阿尔巴尼亚贵宾作汇报表演。
    下午三时半，信号弹飞向天空，表演开始了。六名女民兵以卧姿瞄准百米外的三十个气球，迅速射击，弹无虚发，三十个气球全部中弹。谢胡、卡博等同志热烈鼓掌，称赞她们迅速准确地消灭了“敌人”。喷火表演开始，五名民兵身背喷火器，卧倒在地，对着几十米外的“敌堡”和集团目标，发射出一条条火龙，刹时火势熊熊，“敌堡”和“敌人”同归于尽。接着，男女民兵用半自动步枪表演了对钢板靶移动速射和对胸环靶固定速射，每个民兵弹无虚发，都取得优秀成绩。四名报靶员扛着胸环靶跑到谢胡、卡博同志面前，请阿尔巴尼亚贵宾检阅射击的成绩。谢胡同志等贵宾都站起来，看了每个靶命中的命中率，赞扬女民兵、全省闻名的女神枪手汪月霞和其他民兵打得出色。
    由三十二名男女民兵参加的对空中目标射击表演，给贵宾们留下了良好的印象。当天空中出现了“敌人空降兵”时，民兵们迅速散开隐蔽好，用半自动步枪、冲锋枪、轻机枪组成了猛烈、密集的火力网，在几分钟内就命中目标。当几个民兵把满身中弹的空降靶送到谢胡等同志面前时，谢胡同志接过靶子，看了又看，兴奋地说：打烂了！打烂了！
    汇报表演结束后，男女民兵列队在看台前，谢胡、卡博同志等接见了全体民兵，并亲切地和他们一一握手祝贺。接见后，谢胡、卡博同志等贵宾同李先念、江华等同志，走进民兵的行列，和民兵们手挽着手，合影留念。谢胡同志还同参加汇报表演的女民兵合影留念。他说他要把这张照片带给阿尔巴尼亚女民兵。
    谢胡同志在和民兵们告别前，把一面锦旗赠送给浙江民兵，他热情洋溢地说：“我代表阿尔巴尼亚民兵把这面锦旗送给你们，这面红旗标志着阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命斗争中流过的鲜血，旗上的五星代表着社会主义，旗上的双头鹰说明两重意义，那就是阿尔巴尼亚过去和现在都是在两条战线上进行斗争，一方面对国外的敌人保持高度的警惕，它们胆敢打来，我们就要把它消灭掉；另一方面表示我们为防止在国内产生修正主义和资本主义的复辟而进行的斗争。”民兵教练员接过锦旗，感谢谢胡同志对他们的亲切关怀。他说：“我们浙江民兵，在毛主席人民战争思想教育下，一定坚决为反对美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义作好一切准备！”随后，他和参加表演的民兵一起高呼：“霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“欢迎谢胡同志！”“中阿友谊万岁！”等口号。这时，谢胡同志和卡博同志走过来，同他握手，紧紧拥抱。（附图片）
