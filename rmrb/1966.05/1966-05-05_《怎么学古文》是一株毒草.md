    "How to Study Classical Chinese" is a Poisonous Weed
                          Zheng Dongquan
      In October 1962, Wu Han published a Q&A with a reporter, entitled "How to Study Classical Chinese," in "Journalism Studies." This is a poisonous weed. Wu Han, under the guise of advocating the study of classical Chinese, attempted to lead young people astray.
    In order to lead young people into the gates of indifference to politics, detachment from struggle, and burying themselves in old books, Wu Han first proposed the "secret" of reading more, memorizing more, and copying more to young people, that is: first spend twelve months memorizing fifty classical Chinese articles to "open the door"; then: "with the foundation of fifty articles," "further read representative articles from different historical periods"; "furthermore, study the evolution of literary styles and forms of past dynasties," in order to achieve "entering the hall and ascending the room." This naturally requires putting in a lifetime of effort. Why did Wu Han want to guide young people to spend their entire lives delving into classical Chinese? The answer is very clear. Hu Shi in the 1930s vigorously promoted "整理国故" [zhěnglǐ guógù] "sorting out the national heritage" and "科学救国" [kēxué jiùguó] "saving the country through science." This was to serve Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. Wu Han in the 1960s was in the historical period of the deep development of socialist revolution and construction in our country, and also a period of extremely sharp and complex international and domestic class struggles. In response to the new situation of class struggle, the Party and Chairman Mao repeatedly taught young people to care about politics and class struggle. It was at this time that Wu Han peddled the slogan of burying oneself in old books and writing behind closed doors, which Hu Shi had promoted in the 1930s, smeared it with a layer of learning classical Chinese well, and wanted to lead young people into the pile of old papers. Isn't his intention very clear?
    Wu Han also wanted young people to learn to appreciate classical Chinese, in order to lead young people into the dead end of inheriting feudal morality and cultivating a sentimental, decadent, and aloof-from-the-world outlook on life. He praised "醉翁亭记" [Zuìwēng Tíng Jì] "Record of the Pavilion of the Old Drunkard" for its "very unique style," "春夜宴桃李园序" [Chūn Yè Yàn Táolǐ Yuán Xù] "Preface to the Peach and Plum Garden Banquet on a Spring Night" for its "short text with profound meaning," and "陈情表" [Chénqíng Biǎo] "Memorial to the Throne Pleading for Permission to Remain in Service to My Grandmother" for its "deep emotions." What Wu Han called the "unique style" of "Record of the Pavilion of the Old Drunkard" is the depiction of the idle sentiments and aloof personality of feudal scholar-officials who have nothing to do after eating their fill. The "short text with profound meaning" of "Preface to the Peach and Plum Garden Banquet on a Spring Night" lies in the thick decadent mood of impermanence of life and living in a drunken dream. The "deep emotions" of "Memorial to the Throne Pleading for Permission to Remain in Service to My Grandmother" is the promotion of the feudal moral outlook of "loyalty" and "filial piety." In short, what Wu Han asked young people to appreciate is the life outlook of the sentimental, decadent, aloof, and drinking-and-merrymaking feudal declining class. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era. Our most important task is to study Chairman Mao's works and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. However, Wu Han wants young people to accept the feudal moral outlook and the landlord class's outlook on life. Why is this?
    In order to lead young people into the gate of building a car behind closed doors and detaching themselves from the worker-peasant-soldier masses, Wu Han said: "Applying these writing methods (note: referring to classical Chinese writing methods) flexibly to today's articles can make today's articles more vigorous. Some articles are often written in a very mediocre way now." Here, Wu Han attributes the reason why some articles are written in a mediocre or lifeless way to not having studied classical Chinese well. Articles are reflections of objective things. What is a vigorous and good article? Chairman Mao has long taught us that a good article is one that goes deep into the worker-peasant-soldier masses, is familiar with the lives of the worker-peasant-soldiers, correctly reflects the lives of the worker-peasant-soldiers, and also uses popular language. However, Wu Han desperately asked young people to study classical Chinese, saying:
  "I think the main thing is to learn from classical Chinese the methods of expressing thoughts and feelings, expressing opinions and viewpoints, and describing scenery." We are not against learning a little bit of classical Chinese techniques, but we must see that the thoughts and feelings, opinions and viewpoints, and methods of describing scenery expressed in classical Chinese are mostly the feelings, viewpoints, and methods of the feudal class, and cannot be blindly learned without criticism.
    In such a short "How to Study Classical Chinese," Wu Han attempted to lead young people into evil paths in many ways. What is his fundamental intention? Wu Han said in the article "How to Study Classical Chinese" that it is "used to serve current politics." But whose politics is it serving? According to Wu Han's prescription, the result can only be to serve the bourgeois anti-Party and anti-socialist politics. Wu Han, holding anti-Party and anti-socialist political goals, elevated classical Chinese to an inappropriate position in order to lure young people into straying, which must be criticized.

    《怎么学古文》是一株毒草
                          郑栋权
      一九六二年十月，吴晗在《新闻业务》上发表了一篇《怎么学古文》的答记者问，这是一株毒草。吴晗借提倡学好古文，妄图把青年引入歧途。
    吴晗为了把青年人引进不问政治、脱离斗争、死钻故纸堆的大门，首先向青年提出多读、多背、多抄的“秘诀”，即：先用十二个月的时间背完五十篇古文，“打开大门”；然后是：“有了五十篇的基础”，“进一步读不同历史时期有代表性的文章”；“再进一步，就研究历代文风、文体的演变”，以达到“登堂入室”。这自然是要把毕生精力放进去了。吴晗为什么要引导青年用毕生精力去钻古文呢？这个答案是十分明白的。三十年代的胡适，曾大肆鼓吹过“整理国故”“科学救国”。这是为蒋介石的反动统治效劳的。六十年代的吴晗，正处身在我国社会主义革命和建设深入发展的历史时期，也是国际、国内阶级斗争十分尖锐、复杂的时期。针对阶级斗争的新形势，党和毛主席一再教导青年要关心政治，关心阶级斗争。正是这个时候，吴晗却把胡适在他三十年代鼓吹钻故纸堆、闭门著书的口号贩卖过来，抹上一层学好古文的颜色，要想把青年人引进故纸堆中去。他的用意不是十分清楚吗？
    吴晗还要青年学会欣赏古文，以便把青年引进继承封建道德，培养感伤颓废、孤高自赏的人生观的死胡同中去。他赞赏《醉翁亭记》“风格很奇特”，《春夜宴桃李园序》“文短意长”，《陈情表》“感情深挚”。吴晗所说的《醉翁亭记》的“风格奇特”，就是描写了封建士大夫吃饱了饭无所事事的闲情逸致和孤芳自赏的性格。《春夜宴桃李园序》的“文短意长”，就在于散发着浓厚的人生无常、醉生梦死的颓
  废情调。《陈情表》的“感情深挚”，就是宣扬了封建的“忠”“孝”道德观。总之，吴晗叫青年人欣赏的是感伤颓废、孤高自赏、饮酒行乐等封建没落阶级的人生观。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，我们头等重要的任务，是学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，而吴晗却要青年人接受封建道德观和地主阶级的人生观，这是为什么呢？
    吴晗为了要把青年引进闭门造车、脱离工农兵大众的大门，说什么：“把这些写法（注：指古文写法）灵活地用到今天的文章中来，可以使今天的文章写得有生命力些。现在有些文章往往写得四平八稳。”吴晗在这里把有些文章写得四平八稳或无生命力的原因，归咎于没有学好古文。文章是客观事物的反映。什么是有生命力的好文章呢？毛主席早已教导我们，好文章是通过深入工农兵群众、熟悉工农兵生活、正确反映工农兵生活而又语言大众化的文章。而吴晗却拼命叫青年学古文，说什么：
  “我看主要是学习古文中表达思想感情，表达见解观点，描述景物的方法。”我们不反对学习一点古文的技巧，但必须看到：古文所表现的思想感情、见解观点和描述景物方法，多是封建阶级的感情、观点、方法，不能毫无批判地盲目学习。
    吴晗在这样一篇短短的《怎么学古文》中，企图从多方面把青年引进邪门。其根本用意是什么？吴晗在《怎么学古文》一文中说是“用来为当前的政治服务”。但那是为谁的政治服务呢？按照吴晗的药方，其结果只能是为资产阶级反党反社会主义的政治服务。吴晗抱着反党、反社会主义的政治目的，把古文抬高到不适当的地位，以引诱青年误入迷途，这是必须予以批判的。
