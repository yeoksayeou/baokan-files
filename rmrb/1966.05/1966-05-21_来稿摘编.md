	The great exposure and revelation of the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the "Three-Family Village" black gang has given us a vivid and profound lesson in class struggle. It is not we who are "finished," but the anti-Party elements themselves. The barking of dogs cannot stop the advance of warhorses, and the screeching of owls cannot stop the rising of the sun. The howling and screeching of people like Deng Tuo cannot lower the Party's prestige among the masses of the people, let alone stop the socialist revolution and socialist construction from leaping forward a thousand miles a day.

	"One-Third of Life" is the opening piece of "Yanshan Evening Talks." It asks us to make full use of the "one-third" of our spare time to listen to "Evening Talks" with a "relaxed mood" and "appreciate some useful knowledge from ancient and modern times." This is nothing but anti-Party and anti-socialist knowledge that corrodes people's souls. Deng Tuo said "Evening Talks" were intended to let this knowledge infiltrate our minds, first taking effect in "one-third" of our time, and then slowly taking effect in two-thirds or even all of our time. This conspiracy of Deng Tuo's will never succeed for revolutionary fighters who allow Mao Zedong Thought to play a role in one hundred percent of their time.

	The black gang led by Deng Tuo slandered our Party for "looking down on the masses" and "not caring about the people." This is pure nonsense. I am the daughter of a slave. In the old society, I begged everywhere, and no one cared about me. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao cultivated me into a medical worker. I gloriously joined the Party and became a people's representative of the autonomous prefecture. I sat with the leading comrades of the autonomous prefecture to discuss national affairs. The slave of the old society has become the master of the new society. Is this "looking down on the masses"? Take our Maqu County as an example. In the past, people had no place to go for treatment when they got sick and had to rely on fate. Now there is a county hospital and township health centers, which provide free treatment to the vast number of poor herdsmen, ensuring the health of the people. In the past, the working herdsmen here had to climb mountains and cross rivers to buy grain hundreds of miles away. Now the grain stations are set up at their doorsteps. Is this "not caring about the people"?

    “三家村”黑帮们反党反社会主义言行的大揭发，大暴露，给我们上了一堂生动而深刻的阶级斗争课。“完蛋”的不是我们，而是他们反党分子自己。狗的狂叫拦不住战马的前进，猫头鹰的哀嘶阻挡不住太阳的上升。邓拓之流的狂叫和哀嘶，降低不了党在人民群众中的威信，更阻挡不住社会主义革命和社会主义建设一日千里地向前跃进。

    《生命的三分之一》是《燕山夜话》的开场白。它要我们充分利用“三分之一”的业余时间，以“轻松的心情”去听听“夜话”，“领略一些古今有用的知识”。也就是腐蚀人的灵魂的反党反社会主义知识。邓拓说“夜话”，就是让这些知识侵入我们的头脑，先在“三分之一”的时间里起作用，慢慢地在三分之二以至全部时间里起作用。邓拓这一阴谋，对于毛泽东思想在百分之百的时间里起作用的革命战士讲，是永远不会得逞的。

    邓拓这一伙黑帮污蔑我们党“看不起群众”“不关心人民”。这纯粹是胡说。我是一个奴隶的女儿，在旧社会到处乞讨，没有谁关心过我。解放后，党和毛主席把我培养成一个医务工作者。我光荣地参加了党，还当上了自治州的人民代表，和自治州的领导同志坐在一起商讨国家大事，旧社会的奴隶变成了新社会的主人，这难道是“看不起群众吗”？再拿我们玛曲县来说，过去人患了病，无处治疗，听天由命，现在有县医院，有乡卫生所，给广大贫苦牧民实行免费治疗，保障了人民的身体健康。过去这里的劳动牧民吃粮食，要爬山涉水到数百里以外的地方去买，现在粮站设在家门口上，这难道是“不关心人民”吗？
