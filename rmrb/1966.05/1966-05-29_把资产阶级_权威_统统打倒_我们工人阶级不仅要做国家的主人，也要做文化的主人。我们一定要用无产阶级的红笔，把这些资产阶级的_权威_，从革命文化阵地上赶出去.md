    Thoroughly Overthrow the Bourgeois "Authorities"
    We, the working class, must not only be masters of the state, but also masters of culture. We must use the proletariat's red pen to drive these bourgeois "authorities" out of the revolutionary cultural front.
    Li Feng'en, Deputy Director of the Iron Smelting Plant of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, Representative of the National People's Congress
    Deng Tuo launched a vicious and comprehensive attack on our great Party and the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward. He slandered our Party's leadership as "being self-righteous and looking down on the masses"; he slandered our Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "telling big lies," and "bumping into walls" in the face of facts, and arrogantly clamored for our Party to step down and "rest" quickly. Our struggle with the Deng Tuo clique is a serious class struggle of life and death, and it must not be underestimated. We must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely open fire on the Deng Tuo anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang.
    I would like to focus on the facts of Wuhan Iron and Steel to refute Deng Tuo's slander against the general line and the Great Leap Forward.
    The construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel is a victory for the Party's general line for socialist construction, a victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a product of the Great Leap Forward. Wuhan Iron and Steel is a newly built iron and steel base in our country after liberation. In the process of construction, especially after the Party put forward the general line for socialist construction in 1958, the construction has always been high-speed and a Great Leap Forward. The national plan required two years to build the No. 1 blast furnace in the Iron Smelting Plant, but it was actually completed and put into production in only fourteen and a half months. The No. 2 blast furnace was built even faster, in only one hundred and forty days. The one hundred and twenty-meter-high chimney took only about fifteen days, shortening the original construction period by two-thirds. Not only was the construction speed fast, but the quality of the project was also guaranteed. Wuhan Iron and Steel, a large-scale modern iron and steel complex, started leveling the factory site and building workers' dormitories in 1956, and the blast furnace started producing iron in September 1958, the open-hearth furnace started producing steel in October 1959, and the rolling mill started production in 1960, taking only about five years, two years ahead of the national plan. Isn't this a Great Leap Forward? Is this just empty talk?
    Why did the Deng Tuo clique slander our Great Leap Forward and tell lies with their eyes open? It was not for anything else, but to dream of the restoration of capitalism in our country. Here, we sternly warn the Deng Tuo clique: the Great Leap Forward has not only not failed, but our Wuhan Iron and Steel, like other places across the country, is still moving towards higher goals of high quality, high yield, multiple varieties, and low consumption, and is holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlighting politics, and striving to create a Daqing-style enterprise!
    Chairman Mao taught us: "The intellectuals who harbor hostile sentiments towards our country are a very small minority. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship country, and they miss the old society. Given the opportunity, they will stir up trouble, wanting to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." Deng Tuo and a small handful of people do not like our new China, and they attempt to restore the old China. This is a daydream! I am fifty years old this year, and I spent most of my life in the old society. I was a slave in the old society, and in the new society, I have become the master of the country. The Party has trained me from an ordinary worker to become an engineer and deputy director, and also elected me as a representative of the National People's Congress. Deng Tuo attacked our Party's leadership for "being self-righteous and looking down on the masses," which is nonsense! We must never forget the suffering of the old society, and we must never forget class struggle! We must fight to the end with all demons and monsters and completely bury them.
    We, the working class, must not only be masters of the state, but also masters of culture. With the Party's leadership, with Mao Zedong Thought as guidance, with a red heart for the revolution, we will certainly be able to climb to the peak of the socialist cultural revolution. We must use the proletariat's red pen to drive these bourgeois "authorities" out of the proletarian cultural front and resolutely carry out the Great Cultural Revolution to the end.

    把资产阶级“权威”统统打倒
    我们工人阶级不仅要做国家的主人，也要做文化的主人。我们一定要用无产阶级的红笔，把这些资产阶级的“权威”，从革命文化阵地上赶出去
    全国人民代表大会代表武汉钢铁公司炼铁厂副厂长  李凤恩
    邓拓对我们伟大的党，对党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进，进行了恶毒的全面的攻击。他污蔑我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”；污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”，狂妄地叫喊要我们党赶快下台“休息”。我们同邓拓一伙人的斗争，是一场严重的、你死我活的阶级斗争，决不可轻视。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决向邓拓反党反社会主义黑帮开火。
    我想着重拿武钢的事实来驳斥邓拓对总路线、大跃进的污蔑。
    武钢的建设是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是大跃进的产物。武钢是我国解放后新建的一个钢铁基地。在建设过程中，特别是一九五八年党提出了社会主义建设总路线以后，施工一直是高速度的、大跃进的。炼铁厂一号高炉国家计划要求两年建成，实际上只用了十四个半月就建成投入了生产。二号高炉建成就更快，只用了一百四十天。一百二十米高的烟囱只用了十五天左右，比原计划工期缩短了三分之二。不仅建设速度快，而且保证了工程质量。武钢这个大型的现代化的钢铁联合企业，从一九五六年开始平整厂地和兴建职工住宅，到一九五八年九月高炉开始出铁，一九五九年十月平炉开始出钢，一九六○年轧钢上马，只用了五年左右的时间，比国家原定计划提前了两年。难道这不算大跃进吗？这是说空话吗？
    邓拓一伙人，为什么污蔑我们的大跃进，睁着眼睛说瞎话？不是为了别的，就是梦想资本主义在我国复辟。在这里，我们严厉地警告邓拓一伙人：大跃进不仅没有失败，而且我们武钢与全国其他地方一样，还正在向优质、高产、多品种、低消耗，更大更高的目标前进，正在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，为创造大庆式企业而奋斗！
    毛主席教导我们说：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”邓拓等一小撮人不喜欢我们的新中国，他们企图恢复旧中国，这是白日作梦！我今年五十岁了，大半辈子是在旧社会度过的。我在旧社会是奴隶，在新社会成了国家的主人，是党把我从一个普通工人培养成为工程师、副厂长，还选为全国人民代表大会的代表。邓拓攻击我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”，这是胡言乱语！我们决不能忘记旧社会的苦，决不能忘记阶级斗争！我们要和一切牛鬼蛇神斗争到底，彻底把它们埋葬掉。
    我们工人阶级不仅要做国家的主人，也要作文化的主人。我们有党的领导，有毛泽东思想作指导，我们有一颗为革命的红心，我们一定能攀上社会主义文化革命的高峰。我们一定要用无产阶级的红笔，把这些资产阶级的“权威”，从无产阶级文化阵地上赶出去，坚决把文化大革命进行到底。
