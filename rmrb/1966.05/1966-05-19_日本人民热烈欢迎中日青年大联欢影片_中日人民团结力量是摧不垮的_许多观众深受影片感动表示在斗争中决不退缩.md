    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 17th: The second color documentary film produced by China about the China-Japan Youth Grand Rally, "Unity is Strength," has been publicly screened in Tokyo since May 10th and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of Japanese viewers.
    Many viewers were moved by the film's depiction of the passionate fighting friendship forged between the Chinese and Japanese people in the struggle against their common enemy, and could not help but shed tears. Many viewers also excitedly wrote down their impressions.
    Youth worker Nemoto Tsuneo said, "Throughout the film, I saw moving scenes of mutual support between Chinese and Japanese youth in their struggles, as well as the close bond between the youth workers of both countries. Once again, I deeply experienced the great power of Mao Zedong."
    Yamane Masaru, who participated in the China-Japan Youth Grand Rally as a member of the All-Japan Student Dormitory Association Federation delegation, said, "In the film 'Unity is Strength,' I once again saw those close friends and witnessed the beauty of China. We were inspired and strengthened by the unwavering, warm friendship of our Chinese friends, which will ensure that we never retreat in the face of harsh struggles."
    A young viewer named Nakada said, "In the film, I heard the Chinese people say, 'Your struggle is our struggle,' and 'Your victory is our victory.' These few words embody the close unity between the Chinese and Japanese people and are filled with the power of unity against our common enemy, American imperialism."
    High school student Takagi said, "No matter how the American imperialists, modern revisionists, and Japanese reactionaries try to obstruct us, the united strength of the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be destroyed."
    A young woman named Aono Yasuko said, "In the film, I saw the great New China and the great people. I believe that China is the best country in the world."
    A high school teacher named Haruyama said, "Today, when the enemy is frantically attempting to isolate China, more people should see this film. The film tells people that the hearts of the Chinese people are linked with the hearts of the people of all countries in the world."
    Many viewers expressed extreme indignation at the various acts of the American and Japanese reactionaries to obstruct the China-Japan Youth Grand Rally and expressed their warm anticipation and welcome for the Chinese youth delegation's visit to Japan.
    After the screening of "Unity is Strength" in Tokyo ends on the 19th, it will also be screened in Osaka, Kobe, Sapporo, and other cities.
    The first documentary about the China-Japan Youth Grand Rally has been screened in Japan and has reached over 171,000 viewers from the end of November last year to the end of April this year.

    新华社东京十七日电　中国摄制的第二部纪录中日青年大联欢的彩色影片《团结就是力量》，从五月十日起在东京公开上映，受到日本广大观众的热烈欢迎。

    青年工人根本常男说：“我在影片中到处看到，日中两国青年在斗争中互相支持以及两国青年工人心心相印的动人场面。我又一次深深体会到毛泽东的伟大力量”。
    曾经作为全日本学生寮自治会联合会代表团的成员参加过中日青年大联欢的山根胜说：“我从《团结就是力量》这部影片中，又一次见到了那些亲密的朋友，看到了美好的中国。我们从中国朋友始终不渝的温暖的友谊中得到鼓舞和力量，使我们在严峻的斗争中决不退缩。”
    青年观众中田说：“在影片中，我听到中国人民说‘你们的斗争就是我们的斗争’，‘你们的胜利就是我们的胜利’。在这短短的几句话里，体现了日中两国人民的紧密团结和充满着两国人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义的团结力量。”
    高中学生高木说：“美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本反动派不管怎样地进行阻挠，中国人民和日本人民团结的力量是摧不垮的。”
