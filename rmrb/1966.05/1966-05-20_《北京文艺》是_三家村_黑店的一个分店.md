    "Beijing Wenyi" is a Branch of the "Three-Family Village" Black Shop

    Under the control of the Deng Tuo gang, who held the leading positions in Beijing's ideological and cultural work, "Beijing Wenyi" released a large amount of poisonous weeds in coordination with "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and "Beijing Wanbao." When covering the retreat of the "Three-Family Village," it played the same role as "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and "Beijing Wanbao." "Beijing Wenyi" is a branch of the "Three-Family Village" black shop. Now is the time to expose "Beijing Wenyi"! It is time to thoroughly settle accounts for all the anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities that the Deng Tuo gang engaged in using "Beijing Wenyi"! All positions of the "Three-Family Village" must be smashed and seized back.
    We are fifth-year students in the Chinese Department of Peking University. Since April 16th, we have been temporarily assigned to the "Beijing Wenyi" editorial department to assist in the work. For nearly a month, we have seen and heard some situations, and when we think about the entire issue of "Beijing Wenyi" since 1960, we have a lot to say.
      Cooperating with "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and
          "Beijing Wanbao" to Release a Large Amount of Poisonous Weeds
    We believe that "Beijing Wenyi" has been a bourgeois position in recent years. It has not just released a few poisonous weeds, but a large amount of poisonous weeds. This is not due to a loss of vigilance, but under the control of a small handful of anti-Party elements such as Deng Tuo, in coordination with "Qianxian" and "Beijing Ribao," "Beijing Wanbao," they have released poison together. It can be said that it is a branch of the "Three-Family Village" black shop!
    The following points are clearly proven by the facts.
    First, in January 1961, it published Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" with a boldface headline, firing the first large poisonous arrow of the "Three-Family Village" against the Party and socialism. It can be said that the publication of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was precisely the sign that "Beijing Wenyi" openly raised a big black flag.
    Second, it coordinated with the various battles of the "Three-Family Village" and published a series of "famous" poisonous weeds. In February 1961, when the "elder brother" and "younger brother" of the "Three-Family Village" were complacent because the publication of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" had received support from some people, and they publicly wrote letters to "encourage" each other, the March issue of "Beijing Wenyi" published two articles, "Critique of Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and "Ashamed to Be a Demulcent, Daring to Be Judge Bao of the South," on the one hand consolidating their position and on the other hand intensifying their attacks. In August 1961, Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was published by Beijing Publishing House, even more prominently encouraging right-opportunist elements to "not be屈服(qu fu) by tyranny" and even more brazenly attacking the great Party and socialism. Following this, "Beijing Wenyi" successively published the famous poisonous weeds "Du Zimei Returns Home" and "Tang Emperor Accepts Advice" in April and June of the following year, closely cooperating with it. In addition, in the October 1961 issue, the November 1962 issue, and even as late as the January 1963 issue, "Beijing Wenyi" published three articles praising ghost operas, vigorously promoting the "ghost Hai Rui," "Li Huiniang." At the end of 1961, Liao Mosha published "Afraid of Ghosts 'Jocularly'"; in February of the following year, "Beijing Wenyi" published Wang Fang's "Seeing Ghosts Record" (Beijing opera), very faithfully implementing the spirit of Liao's article. As for Deng Tuo, the commander of the "Three-Family Village," he naturally put his "main energy" on "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and "Beijing Wanbao," but he would never relax his grip on this position. It is worth noting the poem he titled "Cloud Sea Picture" (painting) published in the September 1962 issue. This poem was published before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee of the Party and was a black poem through and through. Let us look at the demeanor of the "commander" from this poem! The original poem is not long, and is recorded below: "Marvels are seen in the vast sky, floating clouds embrace the red flag at the horizon. The sea and mountains are vast, the journey is long, the spring breeze in the fairyland is late, Wuxia and Cangwu are a glimpse, the Xiangfei goddess spreads her eyebrows. High aspirations should relieve the drought of the human world, don't ask for rain in the suburbs." He looked forward to the anti-Party and anti-socialist "floating clouds" at the "horizon," praising what "marvelous scenery in the vast sky"; on the one hand, he was complacent and elated, confident that "the sea and mountains are vast, the journey is long," on the other hand, he felt that "the spring breeze in the fairyland is late," and the development of the "situation" could not satisfy his urgent mood, lamenting that the "spring in the fairyland," that is, the restoration of capitalism, that he expected was still late in coming. Faced with this situation, he used the "magic" of the "commander" to call the wind and summon the rain: "High aspirations should relieve the drought of the human world, don't ask for rain in the suburbs." Look how anxious and eager he is for a counter-revolutionary "storm"! Unfortunately, contrary to his wishes, what he was waiting for was a revolutionary storm that would completely crush their gang!
    Third, in coordination with the "Three-Family Village," they tried every means to promote peaceful evolution, publishing a large number of novels, dramas, operas, poems, and art works, especially comments with "very high" quantity and quality. Some of these works were using the past to satirize the present, distort reality, and directly attack the Party and socialism; some were opposing Mao Zedong Thought with bourgeois and revisionist views; some were praising emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful ladies; and some were promoting the artistic tastes of bourgeois feudalism. These poisonous weeds simply filled "Beijing Wenyi," numbering in the hundreds in 1961 and 1962 alone.
    All these facts show that the leadership of "Beijing Wenyi" is not in the hands of the proletariat, and it is indeed an indispensable branch of the "Three-Family Village" partnership. Although it simultaneously publishes some works by workers, peasants, and soldiers to provide cover, it still cannot change the nature of this black shop filled with black goods.
        Covering the Retreat of the "Three-Family Village"
    From September 1962, the "Three-Family Village" began to retreat. Coincidentally, in a series of retreat "good shows," "Beijing Wenyi" played the same role as "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and "Beijing Wanbao."
              First step: Covering Liao Mosha's Retreat
    In the March 1965 issue, "Beijing Wenyi" reprinted Fan Xing, that is, Liao Mosha's "My 'Harmless Ghosts Theory' is Wrong," and added an editor's note saying: In the "Beijing Wenyi" articles published in the past, such as "Adding Flowers to the Brocade -- A Symposium on 'Li Huiniang'," "they praised and eulogized Meng Chao's newly compiled anti-Party and anti-socialist ghost opera, disseminated and promoted the absurd view of 'harmless ghosts,' which is a serious error of principle." This means that they had to admit that "Li Huiniang" was anti-Party and anti-socialist, but they did not point out the anti-Party and anti-socialist essence of poisonous weeds such as Fan Xing's articles praising "Li Huiniang." The editor's note is equivalent to saying: "Harmless Ghosts Theory" is to promote the view of "harmless ghosts," what is the meaning of this repetition of synonyms? Is it really that articles like "Harmless Ghosts Theory" are only wrong in the view of "harmless ghosts"? For Fan Xing's false self-criticism, the editor's note only vaguely said "please readers read." You reprinted it, of course, it is to ask readers to read, but is it enough just to "read"? Do you need to analyze what kind of "self-criticism" it is? The real role of "Beijing Wenyi" in publishing this article is to cover Fan Xing's retreat, to defend the "Three-Family Village" black shop, including this branch of "Beijing Wenyi"! From the reprint of this article, fourteen months have passed, and we have never seen "Beijing Wenyi" publish or reprint any article settling accounts with Fan Xing. It can be seen that "Beijing Wenyi" defaults that Fan Xing's false self-criticism is true, and it can also be seen that the position and intention of "Beijing Wenyi" are.
      Second step: Liao Mosha can't be protected, turn to protect Wu Han
    Let us first look at the situation when Yao Wenyuan's "Critique of the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" was reprinted in the December 1965 issue! According to the editor's note, after this article was published in "Wenhuibao," it "attracted attention from all sides," "we believe that the issues raised by Comrade Yao Wenyuan are very important." Since this is the case, why did you put this article in the most inconspicuous position in the last article of the publication? Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article opened the prelude to this great debate, and other newspapers and periodicals put it in a prominent position. Why did "Beijing Wenyi" arrange it this way alone? At the beginning, when you published "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," you used a boldface headline in the table of contents, and a large handwritten headline before the article, putting it in a very conspicuous position; the articles supporting "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" were also given eye-catching headlines. Why is such an "important" article so unimportant in the arrangement of "Beijing Wenyi"? This is not a technical problem, but a clear expression of the tendency of your editorial department! What is particularly noteworthy is the thought expressed tortuously in the editor's note: (1) It is specially marked that this article was reprinted by the "Academic Research" column of the "People's Daily," and said: "We decided to launch a discussion on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and related literary and artistic issues" (the emphasis is added by the author, the same below). "Beijing Wenyi" tried to guide the issue to so-called "academic" and "literary" aspects. (2) They believe that this discussion belongs to the internal problems of the people of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and it is necessary to "clarify right and wrong through debate, and improve thinking," but they do not mention a word about the struggle between the two classes and two roads, and the political issues raised by Comrade Yao Wenyuan. (3) Said "This magazine published the script of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in the January 1961 issue, and then published "Critique of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"" and "Ashamed to Be a Demulcent, Daring to Be Judge Bao of the South" in March to praise this script." This is a fact, black and white, and cannot be denied, but what kind of stuff are these "reviews"? The editor's note did not say a word.
    In the January 1966 issue of "Beijing Wenyi," four "contending" articles were published. The first article is titled "This Needs to Be Taken Seriously." The title is still decent, but the first thing this article points out that needs to be taken seriously is not the political issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," but only "some of our historians and playwrights wrote a batch of historical dramas," in which "some praised honest officials," "educating us that feudal society is not so bad, and there are good officials in feudal society." The article also shouted: "This is education that paralyzes consciousness! It is education that instills the theory of class reconciliation!" That's all! However, even this point was erased by the author himself with facts! Then, the article said, "Open the history of Ming Dynasty and see" that "there are too many good saviors, good landlords, and good masters. The first is Zhu Yuanzhang." The author seems to want to prove through arguing that Zhu Yuanzhang, an even bigger "good savior," also exploited and oppressed the people, thereby proving that "Hai Rui," the "savior," is also the dog of the feudal landlord class like other landlord class officials. But read on, it's not. Immediately after that, the article quoted a large string of historical materials, saying how Zhu Yuanzhang "warned his ministers" to "care for the people," saying "he not only said this, but also acted vigorously and earnestly did many things," and also said "in the history of Ming Dynasty, there are several emperors, such as Ming Chengzu, Renzong, and Xuanzong, who can roughly implement Zhu Yuanzhang's political and economic policies." After quoting this long passage, the article does not analyze or criticize it, or distinguish between true and false. In fact, it is saying: Although Zhu Yuanzhang is a feudal emperor, judging from a large number of facts, he is really good to the people, which also proves that Hai Rui can do some good things for the people. It also greatly beautified feudal emperors and generals. If this is the case, then what is wrong with Wu Han writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? The author started from the posture of opposing the writing of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and finally reached this point: not only "instilling the theory of class reconciliation," but also providing evidence for Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Isn't this obvious? Look at these two passages in the article: "We believe that in history, emperors such as Qin Shi Huang, Han Gaozu, Han Wudi, Tang Taizong, Zhu Yuanzhang, etc., and some of their generals and ministers, their various reforms, can bring certain benefits to the people to varying degrees"; "The activities of some feudal landlord class politicians in the early Ming Dynasty, such as Zhu Yuanzhang, can also promote the development of society." Listen, what is this?! This is the shield pushed out by "Beijing Wenyi," this is the echo of eclecticism! What is particularly hateful is that the author is labeled as a worker author, allowing the author to appear as "one" of the working class, in order to save Wu Han and Deng Tuo. We say that this is not the real voice of the working class, and it cannot represent the working class! May I ask the "Beijing Wenyi" editorial department, what is your intention in publishing this article? The views of the other two articles are similar to the previous one. As for Zhiyi's "Hai Rui is "This One" Hai Rui," it is even more evasive of political issues and clearly defends "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." These are the "contentions" mentioned in the editor's note of "Beijing Wenyi"! Who is "contending" with whom? It is the "Three-Family Village" gang using "Beijing Wenyi" as a position, collecting a group of "sympathizers," using some "muddled people," to contend with Comrade Yao Wenyuan and all revolutionary people! This is one-sided! It is said that of these four manuscripts, the first three were published by the editorial department as "positive articles," and the fourth was a manuscript that took a lot of effort to find in order to "establish the opposite side." May I ask: What is the purpose of your painstaking effort to deliberately "establish the opposite side"? We believe that it is very good for poisonous weeds to emerge on their own! We can turn poisonous weeds into fertilizer, and we can use poisonous weeds as negative teachers; and "Beijing Wenyi" is so keen on supporting the growth of poisonous weeds, isn't it deliberately letting poisonous weeds flood?
    After publishing these four "positive" and "negative" articles, just as the discussion was reaching its climax, and Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist reactionary face was becoming clearer and clearer, "Beijing Wenyi" never "contended" again. In the three months of February, March, and April, not a single article discussing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was published or reprinted. What's going on here? Silence, is again one-sided!
      Third step: Wu Han can't be protected, still want to protect Deng Tuo
    Here, I want to talk about some situations that cannot be seen on the page. After "Beijing Ribao" published a batch of so-called "criticisms" of the "Three-Family Village" materials and editor's notes on April 16th, the editorial department repeatedly asked us to study the spirit of the newspaper and organize manuscripts. We listened to the workers' discussions at the Xinhua Printing Factory and organized the workers to write three manuscripts. These manuscripts originally nominated in the order of Wu Nanxing, that is, Wu Han, Deng Tuo, and Liao Mosha. After the editorial department read it, they first enlightened us: "See what is the order of the editor's note in the "Beijing Ribao"! Then he said: "Wu Han is the commander, Liao Mosha, "Beijing Ribao" said "chief general"; Deng Tuo, "Beijing Ribao" only said "opposed Mao Zedong Thought"." They demanded that the order be changed to the order of "Wu Han, Liao Mosha, Deng Tuo". Looking at it now, their understanding of the intention of "Beijing Ribao" can be said to be "thoughtful". Is this intentionally engaging in a false struggle against Deng Tuo and true protection, following "Beijing Ribao," or is it some other problem?
    Let's take a look at the handling of these manuscripts! The first of these three manuscripts reveals that the "Three-Family Village" is actually an anti-Party and anti-socialist essence; the second reveals that Deng Tuo sold anti-Party and anti-socialist goods in the name of talking about history, telling stories, and lecturing. These two were written by veteran workers. The third article was written by a young female worker and activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, revealing Deng Tuo's crime of corrupting young people, competing with the Party for young people, guiding young people to be successors of the bourgeoisie, and paving the way for capitalist restoration. At that time, we felt that they talked very well; now, we deeply feel that they are truly firm in their position, clear in their attitude, and sharp in their eyes! They did not fall for "Beijing Ribao"'s trick and were led by the nose by "Beijing Ribao"; on the contrary, they pointed the main spearhead at Deng Tuo, and pierced Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist essence with one needle. For example, in the second article, the worker comrades criticized "Curing "Amnesia,"" and clearly pointed out that this was viciously cursing the Party for being "forgetful," "crazy," and "stupid." Moreover, the worker comrades analyzed three very insidious "treatment methods," one is to ask the Party to "take a complete rest," not to say anything, not to do anything, and let this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements do whatever they want; the second is to use "dog blood" to "pour on the head" to insult the Party; and the third is to wait for the opportunity to "hit down" the Party with "one stick." Look, how accurate and deep the working class sees! However, after we took them back to the editorial department, the editorial department, on the pretext of "low quality," "empty," and "not many specific materials," first suppressed the second and third articles and prepared to publish the first one; later, they did not even publish the first one. The people in the editorial department vaguely said: "The quality is not high enough." We want to ask: Why do you think that the articles of the worker comrades that are firm in position, clear in attitude, and sharp and pungent are of low quality? Indeed, in your eyes, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is of high quality and should be published with a large headline; "Du Zimei Returns Home" is of high quality and should be placed at the beginning of the publication; articles that promote the artistic taste of the bourgeoisie and feudalism are of high quality, the more the better, and should be published in many pages; the article "This Needs to Be Taken Seriously" to cover Wu Han, quotes a large number of "History of Ming Dynasty," the materials are "specific" and not "empty," and the quality is high, so it should be published; only the articles written by workers, peasants, and soldiers in a combat posture are of "low quality" and should be suppressed. You also said that the May issue focuses on criticizing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and Deng Tuo will be discussed in the next issue. Why have newspapers and periodicals across the country been criticizing Wu Han for a long time, and after you cover it for a while, you become silent and watch from the sidelines. Now that the "commander" of the "Three-Family Village" Deng Tuo has been exposed, you suddenly become active in criticizing Wu Han? What "ghost" is here? You are creating various excuses to suppress the manuscripts of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to cover up Deng Tuo! If Deng Tuo is exposed by the broad masses and other newspapers and periodicals, you will pretend to "criticize." Now, Deng Tuo has finally been completely exposed, and the fog scattered by "Beijing Ribao" is shattered with one shot. You can "actively" get up now. The manuscript that was not going to be published, such as the second manuscript written by the workers of Xinhua Printing Factory mentioned earlier, is now suddenly going to be published. How did the "quality" of this manuscript suddenly "increase"? Doesn't this just show that the so-called "low quality" was originally an excuse? However, publishing it now does not mean that you have really made progress. The driving force is still that the development of the situation is very unfavorable to you, you are "afraid"! "Afraid" that the working class will expose you! This is really: hitting Deng Tuo's body, hurting in your heart; exposing "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," "Beijing Wanbao," scaring "Beijing Wenyi" to palpitate. What a subtle and very inevitable connection!
      Exposing the True Colors of "Beijing Wenyi," Seizing Back
          All Positions of the "Three-Family Village"
    It's time! It's time to expose "Beijing Wenyi"! It is time to further settle accounts for the anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities that the Deng Tuo gang engaged in using "Beijing Wenyi"! "We should use our remaining strength to pursue the tottering foe." For the "Three-Family Village" partnership company with Deng Tuo as the commander and all other anti-Party and anti-socialist black lines, black shops, and black goods, we must thoroughly expose them, criticize them, and destroy them! For "Beijing Wenyi," for this branch of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, we must also let it show its true colors, so that Deng Tuo and others have nowhere to hide! All positions of the "Three-Family Village" must be smashed and seized back!
    Perhaps the "Beijing Wenyi" editorial department will have different opinions from us, so let us also "clarify right and wrong through debate"! If you think we are wrong, then please answer:
      (1) Why were you so active in releasing poisonous weeds in the past few years, fearing that you would fall behind other newspapers and periodicals, but in this Cultural Revolution, you are so inactive, silent for a long time, and pretending to be confused? You released the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Not only did the person who released the poison not seriously disinfect it, but even after others came out to criticize it, you published articles to cover Wu Han. Why is this?
      (2) Why is your pace so consistent with "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and "Beijing Wanbao," and you have to look at their faces everywhere? In the past, they released poison, and you were unwilling to lag behind; they covered Wu Han and Liao Mosha, and you also covered Wu Han and Liao Mosha; they protected Deng Tuo, and you also protected Deng Tuo; they suddenly became "active," and you also followed suit and suddenly became "active." May I ask, how should all this be explained?
      (3) What is your purpose in publishing articles by workers, peasants, and soldiers? Why do you want to suppress those articles that seriously criticize the "Three-Family Village" politically, but then want to publish them again? What kind of psychological state does this reflect?
    Perhaps we don't understand the "facts" very well. If there are any facts that are incorrect or inaccurate, please "Beijing Wenyi" criticize and correct them.

    《北京文艺》是“三家村”黑店的一个分店
    尹文欣　郑友夜　汪炎　方同德　侯文正
    在邓拓一伙黑帮把持北京市思想文化领导岗位的情况下，《北京文艺》配合《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》放了大量的毒草。他们在掩护“三家村”退兵时，又扮演了同《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》一样的角色。《北京文艺》是“三家村”大黑店的一个分店。现在是到了把《北京文艺》揪出来的时候了！是到了彻底清算邓拓一伙利用《北京文艺》所干的一切反党反社会主义罪恶勾当的时候了！“三家村”的一切阵地，统统都要打垮，统统都要夺回来。
    我们是北京大学中文系五年级的学生，从四月十六日起临时抽调到《北京文艺》编辑部帮助工作。将近一个月以来，我们看到、听到一些情况，联想到《北京文艺》从一九六○年以来的整个问题，因而有很多话非说出来不可。
      配合《前线》、《北京日报》和
          《北京晚报》大放毒草
    我们认为，《北京文艺》这几年是一个资产阶级阵地。它不是放了几株毒草，而是放了大量毒草。这不是由于失去警惕，而是在邓拓等一小撮反党分子把持北京市思想文化领导岗位的情况下，配合《前线》和《北京日报》《北京晚报》一起放毒。可以说，它是“三家村”大黑店的一个分店！
    事实很明显地证明了以下几点。
    第一、一九六一年一月，它以黑体大字标题发表了“三家村”急先锋吴晗的《海瑞罢官》，为“三家村”射出了反党、反社会主义的第一支大毒箭。可以说，《海瑞罢官》的发表，正是《北京文艺》公开扯起大黑旗的标志。
    第二、它配合“三家村”各次战役，发表了一系列“著名”的毒草。一九六一年二月，“三家村”的“老兄”、“老弟”为《海瑞罢官》的发表得到一些人的支持而得意忘形，公开致信相互“鼓舞”的时候；三月号的《北京文艺》就发表了《评海瑞罢官》、《羞为甘草剂　敢做南包公》两篇文章，一面巩固阵地，一面加紧进攻。一九六一年八月，吴晗的《海瑞罢官》由北京出版社出版，更加突出地鼓励右倾机会主义分子“不为强暴所屈”，更加放肆地攻击伟大的党和社会主义。紧接着，《北京文艺》在次年四月、六月，先后发表了有名的大毒草《杜子美还家》和《唐王纳谏》等与之密切配合。此外，在一九六一年十月号、一九六二年十一月号，甚至直到一九六三年一月号，《北京文艺》又分别发表了三篇吹捧鬼戏的文章，大肆鼓吹“鬼海瑞”《李慧娘》。一九六一年底，廖沫沙发表《怕鬼的“雅谑”》；次年二月，《北京文艺》即刊出王放的《见鬼记》（京剧），非常忠实地贯彻了廖文的精神。至于“三家村”的主将邓拓，自然是把“主要精力”放在《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》上，可也绝不会放松这个阵地。这里值得注意的是一九六二年九月号上发表他的题《云海图》（画）的诗。这首诗发表在党的八届十中全会召开以前，是一首黑透了的黑诗。让我们从这首诗中看看“主将”的风度吧！原诗不长，照录如下：“浩渺长空见奇迹，浮云天际拥红旗。海山十笏鹏程远，仙苑三春风信迟，巫峡苍梧浑一瞥，湘妃神女展双眉。高情应解人间旱，莫问郊原作雨稀。”他展望着“天际”的反党、反社会主义“浮云”，赞赏什么“浩渺长空景色奇”；一面踌躇满志得意忘形，自信“海山十笏鹏程远”，一面又感到“仙苑三春风信迟”，“形势”发展还满足不了他的迫切心情，感叹他期望的“仙苑三春”即资本主义复辟还迟迟不能到来。面对这种形势，他施展“主帅”的“法术”，呼风唤雨：“高情应解人间旱，莫问郊原作雨稀。”你看他多么焦急，多么迫切地需要一场反革命的“急风暴雨”！可惜事与愿违，他盼来的是一场将彻底冲垮他们一伙的革命风雨！
    第三、配合“三家村”，千方百计地推行和平演变，发表了大批小说、戏剧、曲艺、诗歌、美术作品，特别是数量、质量“都很高”的评论。这些作品里边有的是借古讽今，歪曲现实，直接攻击党，攻击社会主义；有的是以资产阶级、修正主义的观点反对毛泽东思想；有的是吹捧帝王将相、才子佳人；有的是宣扬资产阶级封建主义的艺术趣味。这些毒草简直充斥《北京文艺》，仅一九六一、一九六二两年就数以百计。
    所有这些事实，都说明《北京文艺》的领导权不在无产阶级手里，它确是“三家村”合伙公司的一个不可缺少的分店。尽管它同时发表一些工农兵的作品来打掩护，但是它也还是改变不了这个堆满黑货的黑店的性质。
        掩护“三家村”退兵
    从一九六二年九月起，“三家村”开始退兵。真是无独有偶，在一系列退兵“好戏”中，《北京文艺》又扮演了和《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》一样的角色。
              第一步：掩护廖沫沙退却
    一九六五年三月号，《北京文艺》转载繁星即廖沫沙的《我的〈有鬼无害论〉是错误的》一文，并加了编者按语说：《北京文艺》过去发表的《锦上添花——〈李慧娘〉座谈纪要》等文章中，“吹捧和颂扬了孟超新编的反党反社会主义的鬼戏，散布并宣扬了‘有鬼无害’的荒谬观点，这是严重的原则性的错误”。这就是说，他们不得不承认《李慧娘》是反党反社会主义的了，但对吹捧《李慧娘》的毒草如繁星之流的文章，却根本不去指出其反党反社会主义的实质。编者按等于说：《有鬼无害论》就是宣扬了“有鬼无害”的观点，这种同义语的重复又有什么意义呢？难道《有鬼无害论》之类的文章，真的仅仅是“有鬼无害”这一观点的错误吗？对于繁星这篇假检讨，编者按中只是含糊其词地说了句“请读者阅读”。你们转载了，当然是请读者阅读的，可是仅仅“阅读”就够了吗？要不要去分析它究竟是什么样的“检讨”呢？《北京文艺》发表此文的真正作用，是掩护繁星退却，保卫“三家村”黑店，也包括《北京文艺》这个分店！从转载此文起，迄今十四个月过去了，我们再也没有看到《北京文艺》发表和转载任何一篇清算繁星的文章。可见《北京文艺》是默认繁星这篇假检讨是真的，也可见《北京文艺》的立场和用心了。
      第二步：廖沫沙保不住了，转而掩护吴晗
    让我们先看看一九六五年十二月号转载姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》时的情况吧！据编者按说，这篇文章在《文汇报》发表后，“引起了各方面的重视”，“我们认为，姚文元同志提出的问题很重要”。既然如此，你们为什么把此文放到刊物最末一篇极不显眼的地位呢？姚文元同志的文章，揭开了这场大辩论的序幕，其他各报刊都把它放到显著地位，为什么独独《北京文艺》这样编排呢？想当初，你们发表《海瑞罢官》时，目录中用黑体大字标题，文前用手书体大字标题，把它放在极显眼的地位；发表给《海瑞罢官》捧场的文章，也用了醒目的标题。为什么这样一篇“很重要”的文章，在《北京文艺》的编排中就显得那么不重要呢？这不是个技术问题，而是鲜明地表现了你们编辑部的倾向性！尤其值得注意的是编者按语中曲折地表达出来的思想：（一）特别标出这篇文章是“《人民日报》‘学术研究’专栏”转载了的，并说：“我们决定就《海瑞罢官》及其有关文艺方面的问题展开讨论”（重点是笔者加的，下同）。《北京文艺》力图把问题引导到所谓“学术”和“文艺”方面去。（二）认为这个讨论是属于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”人民内部问题，需要“通过辩论，弄清是非，提高思想”，而对两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，对姚文元同志提出的政治问题，却只字不提。（三）说“本刊在一九六一年一月号发表了《海瑞罢官》剧本后，三月份又发表了赞扬这个剧本的《评〈海瑞罢官〉》和《羞为甘草剂　敢做南包公》。这是事实，白纸黑字，是赖不掉的，但是，这些“评论”是什么货色呢？编者按语里却不置一词。
    一九六六年一月号《北京文艺》，发表了四篇“争鸣”文章。头一篇题目是《这需要认真对待》。题目倒还象样子，然而这篇文章首先指出的需要认真对待的不是《海瑞罢官》的政治问题，而只是“我们的一些历史学家、剧作家写了一批历史剧”，其中“有的歌颂清官”，“教育我们说，封建社会并不那么坏，封建社会里有好官”。文章还大喊：“这是麻痹意识的教育！是灌输阶级调和论的教育！”仅此而已！然而，就连这一点也写上被作者自己用事实抹掉了！接着，文章说，“打开明史一看”，发现“这样的好救星、好地主、好老爷实在是太多了。头一个就是朱元璋”。作者似乎是要通过论证朱元璋这个更大的“好救星”也是一样剥削人民压迫人民，从而反证“海瑞”这个“救星”也和其它地主阶级官吏一样，是封建地主阶级的走狗。可是看下去，不然。紧接着文章引用了一大串史料，说朱元璋如何“警告群臣”要“恤民”，说“他不但这样说，而且雷厉风行，认真办了很多事”，还说“明朝历史上能大致执行朱元璋这些政治经济政策的，还有明成祖、仁宗、宣宗好几个皇帝”。文章引了这一大段话之后，丝毫也不去分析批判，辨别真假，实际上是说：尽管朱元璋是封建皇帝，可从大量事实看来，他对老百姓还真不错，这也证明海瑞能为人民办些好事。还就大大美化了封建帝王将相。如果真是这样，那末吴晗写《海瑞罢官》又有什么不可以？作者从摆出反对写《海瑞罢官》的架子开始，终于走到了这种地步：不仅“灌输阶级调和论”，而且为吴晗的《海瑞罢官》提供了证据。这还不明显吗？再看文中这两段话：“我们认为历史上秦始皇、汉高祖、汉武帝、唐太宗、朱元璋等等这些皇帝，以及他们的一部分将相，他们的种种改良措施，能在不同程度上给人民带来一定利益”；“朱元璋等明代初期的一些封建地主阶级政治家的活动，还能推动社会向前发展”。请听，这是什么话？！这是《北京文艺》推出来的挡箭牌，这是折衷主义的应声虫！特别可恶之处还在于文前标明是工人作者，让作者以工人阶级“一员”的身份出现，以此来为吴晗、邓拓救驾。我们说，这不是真正的工人阶级的声音，不能代表工人阶级说话！请问《北京文艺》编辑部，你们发表这篇文章的用心何在？另外两篇文章的观点，与上一篇大同小异。至于志毅的《海瑞就是“这一个”海瑞》，更是避开政治问题，明显地为《海瑞罢官》辩护的。这些就是《北京文艺》编者按里所说的“争鸣”吧！是谁和谁“争”呢？是“三家村”一伙以《北京文艺》作阵地，搜罗一批“同情者”，利用一些“糊涂人”，向姚文元同志和一切革命人民争！这是一边倒！据说这四篇稿子，前三篇是编辑部作为“正面文章”发表的，第四篇是为了“树立对立面”，费了好大劲才组到的稿。试问：你们这样苦心孤诣地故意去“树立对立面”是为了什么？我们认为，毒草自己冒出来，好得很！我们可以锄毒草变肥料，可以把毒草作为反面教员；而《北京文艺》这样热中于扶植毒草生长，不是故意让毒草泛滥又是什么呢？
    发表这四篇“正面”、“反面”的文章以后，正当讨论走向高潮，吴晗的反党反社会主义的反动面目越来越清楚的时候，《北京文艺》却再也不“争”了，二、三、四三个月，连一篇讨论《海瑞罢官》的文章也没有发表或转载。这又是怎么回事呢？沉默，又是一边倒！
      第三步：吴晗也保不住了，还要掩护邓拓
    这里要说到一些版面上看不到的情况了。四月十六日《北京日报》发表一批所谓“批判”“三家村”的材料和编者按之后，编辑部一再要我们学习该报精神，去组织稿件。我们在新华印刷厂听了工人座谈，组织工人同志写了三篇稿。这些稿子原来是按吴南星的顺序即吴晗、邓拓、廖沫沙的顺序提名的。编辑部看了之后，先是启发我们：“看看《北京日报》编者按是什么顺序！”继而又说：“吴晗是主帅，廖沫沙呢，《北京日报》说是‘主将’；邓拓，《北京日报》只是说‘反对毛泽东思想’”。他们要求把顺序一律改成“吴晗、廖沫沙、邓拓”的顺序。现在看来，他们领会《北京日报》的意图真可以说是“体贴入微”了。这是有意对邓拓搞假斗争、真掩护，跟着《北京日报》走呢，还是别的什么问题呢？
    再看看这些稿子的处理情况吧！这三篇稿子第一篇是揭发“三家村”实际是一家的反党反社会主义实质；第二篇是揭露邓拓借谈历史、说故事、讲学问之名，贩卖反党反社会主义的货色。这两篇都是老工人写的。第三篇是一位青年女工、学习毛主席著作积极分子写的，揭露了邓拓腐蚀青年，和党争夺青年，引导青年作资产阶级接班人，为资本主义复辟开路的罪行。当时，我们感到他们谈得很好；现在，我们更加深深地体会到，他们真是立场坚定，态度鲜明，眼光锐利！他们并没有上《北京日报》的当，被《北京日报》牵着鼻子走；相反，他们把主要矛头指向邓拓，一针见血地戳穿了邓拓的反党反社会主义实质。例如第二篇文章中，工人同志批判《专治“健忘症”》，明确指出这就是恶毒地咒骂党“健忘”、“发疯”、“发傻”。并且，工人同志分析了三条十分阴险的“治病方法”，一是要党“赶紧完全休息”，什么话都不要说，什么事都不要作，让他们这伙反党反社会主义分子为所欲为；二是以“狗血”“淋头”来污辱党；三是等待时机，“一棍子”打倒党。请看，工人阶级看得多准、多深！可是，我们把它们拿回编辑部以后，编辑部竟借口“质量不高”、“空”、“具体材料不多”，先是压下第二、第三两篇，准备发第一篇；后来又连第一篇也不发了。编辑部的人含含糊糊地说：“质量还不够”。我们要问：为什么工人同志这种立场坚定、态度鲜明、尖锐泼辣的文章，你们就认为质量不高呢？的确，在你们眼里，《海瑞罢官》质量高，应该用大字标题发表；《杜子美还家》质量高，应该放到刊物的头一篇发表；宣扬资产阶级、封建主义艺术趣味的文章质量高，多多益善，应该连篇累牍地发表；掩护吴晗的《这需认真对待》一文，大量引用《明史》，材料“具体”而不“空”，质量高，应该发表；唯独工农兵以战斗姿态写出来的文章“质量不高”，应该压下。你们还说，五月号集中批判《海瑞罢官》，邓拓下期再说。为什么全国报刊早就在批判吴晗，你们掩护一阵之后就沉默不语，袖手旁观，现在“三家村”的“主将”邓拓被揪出来了，你们忽然对批判吴晗积极起来了呢？这里有一个什么“鬼”？你们是在制造种种借口，压制工农兵稿件，掩护邓拓！如果万一邓拓被广大群众和其他报刊揪出来之后，你们再来假装“批判”。现在，邓拓终于完全被揪出来了，《北京日报》散的迷雾一照即破，你们这一下可“积极”起来了。原来不准备发表的稿子，如前面提到新华印刷厂工人写的稿子中的第二篇，现在却忽然又要发表了。这篇稿子的“质量”怎么忽然“高”起来了呢？这不正好说明所谓“质量不高”，原来是一个借口吗？不过，现在发表它也并不表明你们真正进步了，起推动作用的还是形势发展对你们十分不利，你们“怕”！“怕”工人阶级把你们揪出来！这真是：打在邓拓的身上，疼在你们的心上；揪出了《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》，吓得《北京文艺》心惊肉跳。多么微妙而又十分必然的一种联系啊！
      揭露《北京文艺》的原形，夺回
          “三家村”的一切阵地
    是时候了！是把《北京文艺》揪出来的时候了！是进一步清算邓拓一伙利用《北京文艺》所干的反党反社会主义罪恶勾当的时候了！“宜将剩勇追穷寇”。对于以邓拓为主将的“三家村”合伙公司和一切其他反党反社会主义的黑线、黑店、黑货，我们一定要彻底揭露它们，批判它们，摧毁它们！对于《北京文艺》，对于“三家村”黑店的这一个分店，也一定要让它原形毕露，使邓拓等人毫无藏身之处！“三家村”的一切阵地，统统都要打垮，统统都要夺回来！
    也许《北京文艺》编辑部同我们会有不同的意见，那就让我们也来“通过辩论、明辨是非”吧！如果你们觉得我们说的不对，那么请你们回答：
      （一）为什么在前几年放毒草时那么积极，唯恐落在别的报刊后面，而在这次文化大革命中却那么不积极，长期沉默，假装糊涂呢？《海瑞罢官》这株大毒草是你们放出来的，放毒的人不但不认真消毒，直到别人出来批判了，你们还发表为吴晗打掩护的文章，这是为什么？
      （二）你们的步调为什么同《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》那么一致，处处要看着他们的眼色行事呢？过去他们放毒，你们不甘落后；他们替吴晗、廖沫沙打掩护，你们也替吴晗、廖沫沙打掩护；他们包庇邓拓，你们也包庇邓拓；他们忽然“积极”起来，你们也跟着忽然“积极”起来。请问，这一切究竟应该如何解释呢？
      （三）你们发表工农兵的文章，目的究竟是为了什么？为什么对于那些从政治上严肃批判“三家村”的文章，你们忽而想压下去，忽而又想发表？这究竟反映了一种什么心理状态呢？
    也许我们不太了解“实情”，有什么事实讲得不对、不准确，请《北京文艺》批评、指正。
