    Just as the spring is bright and beautiful, the Guinean National Djoliba Dance Troupe, led by Director-General Sissoko Amadou, was invited to visit our country. The broad masses of audiences in Beijing were very happy about the arrival of the Guinean artists from the fighting Africa, considering it a major and joyful event in cultural life.

    The people of China and Guinea have a deep friendship. This is not an ordinary friendship, but a revolutionary friendship, a fighting friendship. This friendship was established and developed in the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism.

    The Chinese people are deeply excited and encouraged by the achievements made by the Guinean people under the leadership of President Sékou Touré in the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism and in safeguarding national independence, as well as by their contributions to supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation, supporting the national liberation struggles of the peoples of African countries, and maintaining Afro-Asian solidarity. Precisely because of this, we feel that the visit of the Guinean National Djoliba Dance Troupe to our country has brought us not only the excellent art of the Guinean people, but also the revolutionary friendship of the fighting Guinean people. This friendship is overflowing throughout the entire visit and performance, and it is concentratedly embodied in the song "Fighting Africa Sings Praises to Mao Zedong and His Great Cause," written and led by singer Gonte Forde. Singers and dancers danced and sang in front of Chairman Mao's portrait:
      "Your works, ah, are endless power,
    Your thoughts, ah, are a sun that never sets,
    It illuminates the vast China,
    And also illuminates the hearts of the fighting people all over the world. Ah, Mao Zedong, I sing praises to you, I sing praises to you. Your works, ah, are endless power, your thoughts, ah, are a sun that never sets! If I go to Africa, I will dedicate this song to my Black brothers; if I go to Europe and America, I will sing to my White brothers. Ah, no matter where I go, wherever I head, I must spread this voice of truth, this truth, is the battle cry for freedom; this truth, is the brilliant thought that shines throughout the universe! Your brilliance, ah, I will never finish singing, but I will always sing praises to you! Always sing praises to you!"

    This is a poem condensed from friendship, a crystallization of friendship! A few concise lines of poetry are better than a thousand words, expressing the singer's sincere friendship towards the Chinese people, and expressing the sincere friendship of the Guinean people, even the fighting African people!

    Singer Gonte Forde is well-known to Chinese audiences. When the Guinean National Second Dance Troupe visited China in 1964, his emotional singing still remains in the memory of Chinese audiences, and this performance will increasingly deepen people's memories. In addition to singing "Fighting Africa Sings Praises to Mao Zedong and His Great Cause," he also enthusiastically sang Chinese songs such as "The East is Red," "Socialism is Good," and "The Glory of Mao Zedong" amidst warm applause from the audience. The excited audience couldn't help but clap and beat time for him, and the stage and the audience were integrated into one through the friendship of struggle.

    Kouyate Sory Kandia, the deputy director of the dance troupe, also excitedly sang the Chinese songs "Listen to the Party" and "Ten Songs of the Border Region," which were extremely warmly welcomed by the audience. The deputy director is an excellent singer. His full and abundant emotions, his loud and powerful voice, and his well-controlled singing skills are deeply appreciated by the audience. We thank him for his active contribution to enhancing the fighting friendship between the people of China and Guinea.

    The Djoliba Dance Troupe's programs express the Guinean people's love for their motherland and their fighting spirit against reactionary forces, reflect the Guinean people's labor life and spiritual outlook, and all programs have a distinct Guinean national style.

    The chorus "Djoliba," led by Deputy Director Kouyate Sory Kandia, is a singing and dancing program that is full of song and dance, and is emotionally warm and moving. The dance "Mountain Spring Devil" is even more combative and has realistic educational significance. It educates people that in the face of imperialism and all reactionary forces, the oppressed and enslaved people of the world can only, like the awakened villagers in the dance, abandon all illusions, unite, persist in the struggle, and win the final victory.

    Other programs of the Djoliba Dance Troupe, such as the dance "Games of Urban and Rural Youth" and the comic opera "Troubadour's Wedding," are also colorful, lively, and full of a strong atmosphere of life. While appreciating the art, we have more understanding of the spiritual outlook and national customs of today's Guinean urban and rural youth. The performances of the dancers and the performances of the musicians have left us with a deep impression. In particular, the wonderful performances of several young drummers and young dancers strongly attracted the audience, and we are happy that the dance troupe has cultivated such excellent successors.

    After enjoying the performance program of the Djoliba Dance Troupe, I deeply feel that whether in terms of ideological or artistic quality, there has been a significant new improvement compared with the visit to China in 1964. This shows that Guinea's national culture and art are developing vigorously. The hard work of the Guinean artists is worth our humble study. (Attached picture)

### 战斗的友谊，战斗的艺术

    战斗的友谊，战斗的艺术
                         王元方
    正当春光明媚的时候，几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团在总团长西索柯·阿马杜的率领下应邀来到我国。北京的广大观众为来自战斗的非洲的几内亚艺术家们的光临感到非常高兴，认为这是文化生活中的一件大事、一件喜事。
    中几两国人民有着深厚的友谊。这不是一般的友谊，而是革命的友谊，战斗的友谊。这种友谊是在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中建立和发展起来的。
    中国人民为几内亚人民在塞古·杜尔总统的领导下，在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、维护民族独立的斗争中所取得的成就，以及在支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争、支持非洲各国人民的民族解放斗争和维护亚非团结方面所作出的贡献，深感兴奋和鼓舞。正因为这样，我们感到几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团这次来我国访问，为我们带来的不只是几内亚人民的优秀艺术，而且更是战斗的几内亚人民的革命友情。这种友情洋溢在整个的访问演出中，它集中地体现在由歌唱家贡特·福德所编写和领唱的《战斗的非洲歌颂毛泽东和他伟大的事业》这首歌曲里。歌唱家和舞蹈家们在毛主席的象前边舞边唱：
      “您的著作啊，就是无穷的力量，
    您的思想啊，是永远不落的太阳，
    它照亮了辽阔的中国，
    也把全世界战斗的人民心儿照亮。啊，毛泽东，我把您歌唱，我把您歌唱。您的著作啊，就是无穷的力量，您的思想啊，是永远不落的太阳！如果我去非洲，我将把这歌声献给黑人兄弟；如果我去欧美，我要对白人兄弟歌唱。啊，不管走到哪里，奔向何方，我都要把这真理的声音传播，这真理，就是争取自由的战斗号角；这真理，就是普照宇宙的光辉思想！您的光辉啊，我永远唱不尽，但我要永远把您歌唱！永远把您歌唱！”
    这是友谊凝成的诗篇，是友谊的结晶！简练的几行诗句，胜似千言万语，道出了歌唱家对中国人民的真挚友谊，道出了几内亚人民以至战斗的非洲人民的真挚友情！
    歌唱家贡特·福德是为中国观众所熟知的。当一九六四年几内亚国立第二舞蹈团访华演出时，他那富有感情的歌唱至今仍旧留在中国观众的记忆里，而这次的演唱将愈益加深入们的记忆。他除了演唱《战斗的非洲歌颂毛泽东和他伟大的事业》这首歌曲外，还在观众热烈的掌声下热情地演唱了《东方红》、《社会主义好》和《毛泽东的光辉》等中国歌曲，激动的观众情不自禁地为他击掌拍节，台上台下被战斗的友谊融成了一体。
    舞蹈团副总团长库雅特·索里·康迪亚也兴奋的演唱了中国歌曲《听话要听党的话》和
  《边区十唱》，受到观众极为热烈的欢迎。副总团长是一位出色的歌唱家，他那饱满充沛的情绪，宏亮有力的歌喉和控制自如的演唱技巧，深为观众所欣赏。我们感谢他为增进中几两国人民的战斗友谊所作出的积极贡献。
    佐利巴舞蹈团的节目表达了几内亚人民热爱祖国和向反动势力进行斗争的战斗精神，反映了几内亚人民的劳动生活和精神面貌，而所有节目又都具有鲜明的几内亚民族风格。
    由副总团长库雅特·索里·康迪亚领唱的合唱“佐利巴”，是一个载歌载舞、情绪热烈而动人的歌舞节目。舞蹈“山泉魔鬼”更富有战斗性，具有现实的教育意义。它教育人们，面对帝国主义和一切反动势力，全世界被压迫和被奴役的人民也只有象舞蹈中觉醒的村民一样，丢掉一切幻想，团结起来，坚持斗争，去赢得最后的胜利。
    佐利巴舞蹈团的其他节目如舞蹈“城乡青年的游戏”和小歌剧《特鲁巴杜尔人的婚礼》等也都色彩绚丽，生动活泼，并散发着浓郁的生活气息。使我们在欣赏艺术的同时，对今天几内亚城乡青年的精神面貌和民族的风尚习惯有了更多的了解。舞蹈家们的表演，音乐家们的演奏都给我们留下了很深的印象。尤其是几位少年小鼓手和小舞蹈家的精采表演，更强烈地吸引着观众，我们为舞蹈团培养了这样优秀的接班人而感到高兴。
    欣赏了佐利巴舞蹈团的演出节目，深感不论在思想性和艺术性方面，都较之一九六四年的访华演出明显地有了新的提高。这说明几内亚的民族文化艺术事业正在蓬勃发展。几内亚艺术家们的刻苦努力是值得我们虚心学习的。（附图片）
