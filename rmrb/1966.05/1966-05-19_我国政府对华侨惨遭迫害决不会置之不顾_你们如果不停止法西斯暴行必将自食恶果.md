    Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Issues Statement Sternly Warning the Indonesian Government
    The Chinese Government Will Never Ignore the Persecution of Overseas Chinese
    If You Do Not Stop the Fascist Atrocities, You Will Surely Suffer the Consequences!
    The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Expresses Condolences and Respect to the Victimized Overseas Chinese: Under the Cruel Persecution of Indonesian Right-Wing Reactionary Forces, the Broad Masses of Overseas Chinese Have Carried Forward the Glorious Patriotic Tradition, Persisted in National Integrity, Persisted in Friendship with the Local People, Distinguished Right from Wrong, Remained Fearless in the Face of Danger, United and Helped Each Other, and Shared Weal and Woe.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People’s Republic of China today issued a statement sternly refuting the Indonesian government's denial of its responsibility for persecuting Overseas Chinese. The statement indicated that the Chinese government would never ignore the cruel persecution of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia by right-wing reactionary forces. The statement announced that, in order to relieve the suffering of the victimized Overseas Chinese as soon as possible, the Chinese government has decided to send ships to Indonesia to transport those victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to their motherland. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Since October of last year, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, while launching a counter-revolutionary military coup and frantically opposing communism and the people, have stirred up a violent anti-China and anti-Chinese wave, instigating and organizing thugs to carry out inhumane persecution of Overseas Chinese. The Chinese government has lodged more than ten strong protests with the Indonesian government regarding this matter. The Indonesian government not only failed to take effective measures to stop the atrocities against Overseas Chinese, but also increasingly blatantly encouraged and organized reactionary thugs to persecute Overseas Chinese, even to the point that military and political authorities openly came forward to discriminate against the Chinese. We express our extreme indignation at this.
    The Indonesian government, while intensifying its persecution of Overseas Chinese, babbled that the Chinese government's protests "do not fully conform to the existing facts." Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Suharto even went so far as to say that, regarding the safety of Overseas Chinese, "up to now, there is nothing to worry about." They vainly attempt to conceal the truth and deny their responsibility for persecuting Overseas Chinese. This is completely futile.
    As everyone knows, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have organized, planned, and systematically created large-scale anti-Chinese atrocities in various places. Right-wing military and political authorities in various regions mobilized troops, organized and directed thugs to carry out frenzied attacks on Overseas Chinese, wantonly destroying and burning Overseas Chinese shops, residences, schools, and social organizations, plundering Overseas Chinese property, and even carrying out barbaric massacres of Overseas Chinese. Many Overseas Chinese were beaten to death with clubs, stabbed to death with sharp knives, burned to death in fires, drowned after being thrown into rivers, and some were even beheaded, disemboweled, and dismembered, not even sparing the elderly, weak, women, and children. For example, in the large-scale anti-Chinese atrocities that occurred on Lombok Island in late December last year, thugs killed and set fires everywhere, and more than twenty Overseas Chinese were killed on December 30 alone. The wife of Overseas Chinese Wu Yudian was pregnant and awaiting childbirth. Right-wing thugs locked her and her six children in a house, then set fire to the house, burning the mother and seven children alive together. For example, on January 12 this year in Mema County, Sumbawa, thugs organized by right-wing reactionary forces drove all of the more than one thousand Overseas Chinese men, women, old, and young in the county out of their homes, robbed them of all their property, and also brutally beat them with clubs and hacked at them with knives and axes, causing heavy casualties among the Overseas Chinese.
    After the Indonesian right-wing generals' group reorganized the cabinet in March this year, completing their plan to usurp power, anti-Chinese activities further developed, and atrocities such as killing, arson, destruction, looting, beatings, kidnapping, rape, and humiliation became even more frequent. For example, from April 15 to 24, all Overseas Chinese in Simawei, North Aceh, suffered ten consecutive days of frenzied attacks by right-wing reactionary forces. On April 20, armed police officers colluded with thugs to drive all Chinese, including the sick, out of their homes, stripped the adult men naked, poured various colors of paint on their heads and faces, wrote anti-China slogans on their bodies, and then beat and kicked them, insulting them in every way. At the same time, they drove all the men, women, old, and young barefoot to run and gather in front of the county magistrate's office, where they were exposed to the scorching sun for more than five hours. Thugs also repeatedly looted every household of Overseas Chinese in the city, robbing them of all their property. The right-wing generals' group even openly issued orders in the name of the government to carry out anti-Chinese activities, unreasonably taking over, seizing, and closing down Overseas Chinese social organizations and Overseas Chinese schools in various places. Right-wing military and political figures also clamored to seize all the property of Overseas Chinese and deprive them of their livelihoods. Currently, in various parts of Indonesia, tens of thousands of Overseas Chinese have been left homeless, destitute, and in extremely dire straits.
    The atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in persecuting Overseas Chinese are irrefutable and soaked in blood. Can the Indonesian government cover up its crimes by simply saying that they "do not conform to the facts"? The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are so brutally persecuting Overseas Chinese, and Suharto still tells Overseas Chinese "not to worry." Does he want Overseas Chinese to sit idly by and allow them to be slaughtered at will?
    In their anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, the Indonesian right-wing generals' group even openly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, acting in cahoots. They organized Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to collude with right-wing military personnel and thugs to attack our embassies and consulates. They used Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents as pawns to persecute Overseas Chinese even more rampantly, coercing Overseas Chinese to participate in anti-China rallies, forcing Overseas Chinese to express "loyalty" to the Indonesian right-wing military regime, and attempting to alienate Overseas Chinese from their motherland. As everyone knows, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang is a traitorous clique long despised by the Chinese people and a loyal running dog of U.S. imperialism. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fully exposes what they really are.
    What is even more infuriating is that the Indonesian government even claims that the atrocities of persecuting Overseas Chinese were caused by the "attitudes and behaviors" of the Overseas Chinese. This is truly malicious slander and a case of blaming the victim. For generations, the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have resided in Indonesia. Together with the Indonesian people, they have jointly developed Indonesia's fields and mines and jointly resisted the colonial rule of Dutch imperialism and Japanese imperialism, forging a close friendship with the Indonesian people that is thicker than blood. After Indonesia gained independence, they actively supported the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, actively supported Indonesia's development of its national economy, and made contributions to promoting friendly relations between the two countries and enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. These ironclad facts cannot be erased by the Indonesian government. After cruelly persecuting the broad masses of defenseless and innocent Overseas Chinese, the Indonesian government turns around and tries to blame the persecuted Overseas Chinese. This can only arouse the anger and condemnation of fair-minded public opinion around the world.
    It must be pointed out that, according to the norms of international relations, every country has a responsibility to protect the safety of the lives and property of foreigners. The treaties signed between China and Indonesia also explicitly stipulate that both sides are willing to "protect the legitimate rights and interests of each other's nationals." Now, the Indonesian government not only has not protected the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese, but has instead made persecuting Overseas Chinese its established policy. This not only tramples on the basic norms of international relations, but also violates its international obligations.
    Under the command of the right-wing generals' group, the Indonesian government disregards international credibility and uses every means to oppose China and persecute Overseas Chinese. This is inseparable from their extremely reactionary policy of relying on imperialism externally and slaughtering the Indonesian people internally. The purpose of their actions is to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism and deliberately undermine relations between China and Indonesia. Their actions fully expose that they have completely degenerated into pawns of U.S. imperialism.
    We want to solemnly warn the Indonesian government: Under any circumstances, the Chinese government has the responsibility to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its own nationals. The Chinese government will never ignore the cruel persecution of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia by right-wing reactionary forces. If you do not stop these fascist atrocities, you will surely suffer the consequences.
    We are constantly concerned about the safety of the broad masses of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. We extend our deep condolences to the victimized Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Under the cruel persecution of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, the broad masses of Overseas Chinese have carried forward the glorious patriotic tradition, persisted in national integrity, persisted in friendship with the local people, distinguished right from wrong, remained fearless in the face of danger, united and helped each other, and shared weal and woe. We express our highest respect to you!
    The Chinese government is extremely concerned about the current situation of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. It is completely reasonable for the Chinese government to request the Indonesian government to arrange ships to send those victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to their motherland back to China. Before the Indonesian government fulfills its due responsibilities, the Chinese government, in order to relieve the suffering of the victimized Overseas Chinese as soon as possible, has decided to send ships to Indonesia in the near future to transport those victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to their motherland. We firmly demand that the Indonesian government make a reply that satisfies the Chinese government as soon as possible to the various requests made in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of May 18, so that the victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to their motherland can return to their motherland smoothly as soon as possible. For Overseas Chinese who continue to reside in Indonesia, the Indonesian government must effectively guarantee the safety of their lives and property and immediately cease all activities that persecute Overseas Chinese.

### 我国政府对华侨惨遭迫害决不会置之不顾  你们如果不停止法西斯暴行必将自食恶果

    我侨委发表声明正告印度尼西亚政府
    我国政府对华侨惨遭迫害决不会置之不顾
    你们如果不停止法西斯暴行必将自食恶果
    侨委向受害华侨表示慰问和敬意：广大华侨在印尼右派反动势力的残酷迫害下，发扬了光荣的爱国传统，坚持民族气节，坚持和当地人民友好，明辨是非，临危不惧，团结互助，同舟共济。
    新华社十八日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会今天发表声明，严正驳斥印度尼西亚政府抵赖迫害华侨的罪责。声明表示，中国政府对印度尼西亚华侨遭受右派反动势力的残酷迫害决不会置之不顾。声明宣告，为了使受害华侨早日脱离苦难，中国政府决定派船前往印度尼西亚，接运自愿回国的受害华侨返回祖国。声明全文如下：
    自从去年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在发动反革命军事政变，猖狂地反共、反人民的同时，掀起了反华、排华的狂暴逆流，策动和组织暴徒对华侨进行了惨无人道的迫害。中国政府为此向印度尼西亚政府提出了十多个强烈的抗议照会。印度尼西亚政府不但没有采取有效措施，制止迫害华侨的暴行，反而愈来愈露骨地怂恿和组织反动暴徒对华侨进行迫害，甚至由军政当局公开出面排华。对此，我们表示极大的愤慨。
    印度尼西亚政府一面变本加厉地迫害华侨，一面胡说什么中国政府的抗议“不完全符合现有的事实”。印度尼西亚副总理苏哈托还居然说，关于华侨的安全问题，“到现在为止，还没有什么必须担心的事”。他们妄图一手遮天，抵赖他们迫害华侨的罪责。这是完全徒劳的。
    大家知道，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在各地有组织、有计划、有步骤地制造了大规模的排华暴行。各地右派军政当局调动军队，组织和指挥暴徒，对华侨进行疯狂袭击，大肆破坏、焚烧华侨的商店、住宅、学校和社团，抢掠华侨的财产，甚至对华侨进行野蛮屠杀。不少华侨被棍棒打死、利刃刺死、放火烧死、抛入河中淹死，甚至有些华侨被砍头、剖腹、肢解，连老弱妇孺也不能幸免。如去年十二月下旬在龙目岛发生的大规模排华暴行中，暴徒们到处杀人放火，仅十二月三十日一天内被杀华侨就有二十余人。华侨吴玉殿的妻子正怀孕待产，右派暴徒将她和六个小孩关在屋内，然后纵火烧屋，将母子七人一起活活烧死。如今年一月十二日在松巴哇的美玛县，右派反动势力组织的暴徒将全县华侨男女老少一千余人全部逐出家门，抢尽他们的财物，还对他们用棍棒野蛮殴打，用刀斧乱砍乱杀，造成华侨重大伤亡。
    在印度尼西亚右派将领集团今年三月改组内阁，完成了篡夺政权的计划以后，排华活动更进一步发展，杀人放火、破坏抢掠、殴打绑架、奸淫侮辱的暴行，更加层出不穷。如四月十五日至二十四日，北亚齐地区司马委的所有华侨，遭到右派反动势力连续十天的疯狂袭击。四月二十日，持枪军警伙同暴徒将所有华人包括病人全部赶出家门，并剥光成年男人的衣服，在他们头上脸上淋洒各色油漆，在他们身上涂写反华标语，然后拳打足踢，百般侮辱，同时驱赶全体男女老幼赤足跑步，集中到县长公署前，在烈日下曝晒五个多小时。暴徒们还对全市华侨挨家逐户反复洗劫，抢光了他们全部财物。右派将领集团甚至公然以政府名义，直接下令进行排华，无理接管、强占和封闭了各地的华侨社团和华侨学校。右派军政要员还大肆叫嚣要霸占华侨的全部财产，剥夺华侨的生计。目前在印度尼西亚各地，有数以万计的华侨，家破人亡，流离失所，陷于极其苦难的境地。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的暴行，铁证如山，血债累累，难道是印度尼西亚政府说一句“不符合事实”，就能掩盖它的罪责了吗？印度尼西亚右派反动势力这样残暴地迫害华侨，苏哈托还要华侨“不必担心”，难道是要华侨束手待毙，安心让他们任意宰割吗？
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团在反华排华活动中，还竟然公开同蒋匪帮勾结，狼狈为奸。他们组织蒋帮特务伙同右派军人和暴徒袭击我国使领馆。他们利用蒋帮特务作为爪牙，更加猖狂地迫害华侨，胁迫华侨参加反华集会，强迫华侨向印度尼西亚右派军人政权表示“效忠”，妄图离间华侨和祖国的关系。众所周知，蒋匪帮是早被中国人民唾弃的卖国集团，是美帝国主义的忠实走狗。印度尼西亚右派反动势力同蒋匪帮勾结在一起，这就充分暴露了他们究竟是什么货色。
    更加令人愤慨的是，印度尼西亚政府还竟然把迫害华侨的暴行，说成是因为华侨的“态度和行为”引起的。这真是含血喷人，倒打一耙。广大华侨世代居留在印度尼西亚，他们和印度尼西亚人民一起，共同开发印度尼西亚的田园和矿山，共同反抗过荷兰帝国主义和日本帝国主义的殖民统治，同印度尼西亚人民结成了血肉相连的亲密友谊。在印度尼西亚取得独立以后，他们积极支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，积极支持印度尼西亚发展民族经济，为促进两国友好关系和增进两国人民的友谊作出了贡献。这些铁的事实，决不是印度尼西亚政府抹煞得了的。印度尼西亚政府对广大手无寸铁的无辜华侨进行残酷迫害以后，反过来将罪责硬栽在受迫害的华侨身上，这只能引起世界公正舆论的愤怒和谴责。
    必须指出，按照国际关系准则，每一个国家都有责任保护外侨的生命财产的安全，中国和印度尼西亚两国签订的条约还明确规定，双方愿意“保护对方侨民的正当权利和利益”。现在，印度尼西亚政府不但没有保护华侨的正当权利和利益，反而把迫害华侨作为它的既定的政策。这不仅践踏了起码的国际关系准则，而且背弃了它必须承担的国际义务。
    印度尼西亚政府在右派将领集团的指挥下，不顾国际信义，不择手段地反华和迫害华侨，这是同他们对外投靠帝国主义，对内屠杀印度尼西亚人民的极端反动的政策分不开的。他们这样干的目的，是为了迎合美帝国主义的需要，蓄意破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国关系。他们的所作所为，充分暴露了他们已经完全堕落成为美帝国主义的走卒。
    我们要正告印度尼西亚政府：在任何情况下，中国政府都有责任保护自己侨民的正当权利和利益。中国政府对印度尼西亚华侨遭受右派反动势力的残酷迫害，决不会置之不顾。你们如果不停止这种法西斯暴行，必将自食其恶果。
    我们对于印度尼西亚广大华侨的安危时刻记挂在心，我们谨向印度尼西亚受害华侨表示深切的慰问：广大华侨在印度尼西亚右派反动势力的残酷迫害下，发扬了光荣的爱国传统，坚持民族气节，坚持和当地人民友好，明辨是非，临危不惧，团结互助，同舟共济。我们谨向你们表示崇高的敬意！
    中国政府万分关怀印度尼西亚华侨当前的处境。中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府安排船只将那些自愿回国的受害华侨送返中国，是完全合情合理的。在印度尼西亚政府没有履行它所应承担的责任之前，中国政府为了使受害华侨早日脱离苦难，决定最近期间派船前往印度尼西亚，接运自愿回国的受害华侨返回祖国。我们坚决要求印度尼西亚政府对我国外交部五月十八日照会中提出的各项要求，尽早作出使中国政府满意的答复，使自愿回国的受害华侨能够早日顺利地回到祖国。对于继续旅居印度尼西亚的华侨，印度尼西亚政府必须切实保障他们的生命和财产的安全，并立即停止一切迫害华侨的活动。
