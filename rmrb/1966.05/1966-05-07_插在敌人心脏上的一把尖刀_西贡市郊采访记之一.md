A Sharp Knife Inserted into the Enemy's Heart
An Interview in the Suburbs of Saigon, Part 1

"Within Artillery Range"
During our days of interviewing in the suburbs of Saigon, we traveled from the northwest to the southeast of the city, through liberated areas, guerrilla zones, and also enemy-occupied areas. In short, no matter where we went! In broad daylight, American planes that had just taken off from Tan Son Nhut Airport in Saigon appeared larger and larger; at night, the reflection of Saigon's lights in the sky became clearer and clearer. We asked the comrades of the Saigon Front Command how far we were from Saigon. He replied with a smile, "Within artillery range."
Hearing this sentence, one can't help but recall how arrogant the U.S. imperialists were in 1961! Relying on their aircraft and artillery, they launched the heinous "special war" against the South Vietnamese people who were empty-handed. But five years later, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces had already advanced to the outskirts of Saigon, and the liberated areas were "within artillery range" of the Saigon city center. Isn't this fact proof of the earth-shaking changes in the situation of the struggle in South Vietnam?

The heroic South Vietnamese people, daring to struggle and good at struggling, not only established and expanded liberated areas in the mountains and plains, but also in the flatlands of the Saigon suburbs, severely attacking the U.S.-puppet troops, leaving the heads of the Saigon U.S.-puppet clique helpless.

Here, there is evidence everywhere of the people's heroic struggle.

In the Gu Chi district northwest of Saigon, the army and people fought over 200 battles, large and small, against the American aggressors in twelve days in January of this year, killing over 1,000 American soldiers. In many villages in Pingxin district in the northeast suburbs, not a single house or tree is without shrapnel scars. The guerrillas of Shoudou district in the northeast suburbs captured Americans alive on the highway. In the Saigon River in the southern suburbs, the wreckage of enemy ships hit by guerrillas drifted. There is no distinction between front and rear here. There is no fixed front here, but everywhere is a front for annihilating the enemy; there is no fixed battlefield here, but everywhere is a battlefield for killing the enemy. Every inch of land in the liberated area has been taken back with the people's blood and courage. Here, the sound of guns and cannons accompanies us day and night.

The Saigon-Gia Dinh area, which surrounds Saigon, has six counties and has always been the political, military, and economic center of South Vietnam. In the early days of launching the "special war," the U.S. imperialists built more than 270 "strategic hamlets" on the wide plains, almost imprisoning the entire rural population of the area. The enemy's bloody suppression ignited the flames of the people's resistance. In the struggle, the people gradually understood that they could not defeat the enemy without weapons. In the fourth quarter of 1963 alone, the people rose up and destroyed more than 60 "strategic hamlets," seized more than 360 guns, and armed themselves. The first fortress of people's war appeared outside Saigon – the fighting village.

The raging revolutionary fire ignited in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area directly threatened the nest of the U.S.-puppet clique—Saigon. The U.S.-puppet troops vainly attempted to extinguish the revolutionary fire, reoccupy the liberated areas, and protect Saigon, and carried out cruel suppression of the local people. The American aggressor troops went to extremes. Not to mention distant events, in January of this year alone, they dispatched 8,000 troops and more than 200 aircraft to carry out an inhumane "sweep" in northern Gu Chi County, burning more than 1,500 houses and 10,000 bushels of grain in one go. In many villages, only a few charred pillars remained of the houses, and vast rubber plantations and orchards became deathly forest belts with fallen leaves and withered branches. The American bandits dropped 300 tons of bombs on a small village less than one square kilometer in area, and fired more than 3,000 shells into the liberated area in one night. The American aggressors are truly more ferocious and brutal than the fascist Hitler!

"The American bandits have used almost all their murderous weapons against us," an old man from Zhongli Village said angrily to us. "But they have forgotten one thing: revolutionary will and the belief in victory cannot be bombed away or burned away."

The villages in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area are armed, and everyone is armed, extensively carrying out guerrilla warfare, strengthening and consolidating themselves in combat, attacking and eliminating the enemy, and protecting and expanding the liberated areas. What the U.S.-puppet troops, armed to the teeth, fear is precisely these armed revolutionary people.

We walked through many liberated villages. We saw that, right under the crazy bombing and shelling of American planes, people were filling in bomb craters and rebuilding new houses. The crops by the roadside grew very well, with no barren land. Women were picking peanuts by the low bushes, not even raising their heads despite the piercing screams of American planes overhead. After the enemy planes finished bombing and flew away, an old man crawled out of his bunker, shook the soil off his head and body, and looked up at the sky, saying, "This is the ninth time my house has been bombed. I will rebuild it on the same spot for the tenth time. They can't bomb me to death." Girls picked wild red flowers along the road, welcoming us with wild delight. The sound of reading could still be heard in the village classrooms. Even children in their teens could identify the models of enemy planes. They listened carefully to the sound of shells being fired from the artillery, and could immediately and accurately tell you where the shell would land. The trenches in the liberated area can be walked continuously for several hours. Tunnels and fortifications connect villages to villages, and townships to townships. Guerrillas carrying carbines walk back and forth along the edge of the village.... All these scenes contain such strong revolutionary will and confidence in victory!

The tenacious struggle of the people in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area and the continuous development of the liberated area not only directly threatens and strikes at the nest of the U.S.-puppet clique – Saigon, but also cuts off the connection between Saigon and other regions from the ground, strangling the U.S.-puppet troops. The liberated area in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area is like a sharp knife inserted into the enemy's heart.

"Advance the Battle Line to the Outskirts of Saigon"

The sound of guns of the Liberation Armed Forces annihilating the enemy that we heard under the city of Saigon was the most exciting. This gunfire reflects the true power of people's war.

Extending the front line of people's guerrilla warfare to the enemy's rear and forcing the enemy to fight under their feet has become a very obvious characteristic of the extensive and flexible people's guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam. The broad masses of guerrillas cooperate with the local armed forces to flexibly annihilate the enemy on the outer lines, while the main forces of the Liberation Armed Forces lure the enemy deep and wait for the opportunity to concentrate and annihilate the enemy. This forms the magnificent scene of attacking the enemy from all sides on the current South Vietnamese battlefield.

We walked forward along a sandy road that could be used by oxcarts. The sound of artillery fire from the nearby U.S.-puppet military strongholds was getting louder and louder, and the whistling shells exploded in the nearby rubber plantation with a particularly loud echo. At this time, rows of Liberation Army soldiers were sitting on the sandy ground by the roadside, resting. Some soldiers rested their heads on the barrels of heavy mortars, lying on their backs with their legs stretched out, thoughtfully looking at the reflection of the lights on the horizon ahead; some soldiers straightened their backs and wiped their new submachine guns with camouflage cloth.

Our direction of advancement was consistent: approaching Saigon. Without much questioning, under the dim moonlight, the excitement of the soldiers, with their firm and smiling faces, as they prepared for the upcoming battle, was silently transmitted to our hearts.

"Advance the battle line to the outskirts of Saigon" is a symbol of the glorious victory in the people's guerrilla warfare in South Vietnam today. Now, how far is the nearest battle from Saigon? What is the scale of the battle here? Let me first talk about one of the countless battles!

This battle took place on November 18 last year. The battle location was near An Lu Village, Pingxin County, only a few kilometers from Saigon. This offensive was initiated by the Liberation Army and guerrillas.

An Lu Village is in the enemy's rear, close to Highway 4. The village is surrounded by rice paddies. This area is close to Saigon, with many defending enemies and bunkers and guard towers one after another. The terrain is not very favorable for the attacking troops. An Lu Village was garrisoned by a puppet Marine Corps company, and nearby villages were also garrisoned by two companies of puppet troops and a group of American troops.

At night, the waterlogged ridges were slippery and difficult to walk on. The soldiers groped their way through the small paths in the fields, and the long line moved quickly. In the silent wilderness, not a single sound could be heard. This alone was enough to show the soldiers' rich night combat experience.

When the Liberation Army and guerrillas suddenly appeared in front of the enemy, some of the puppet soldiers were still sound asleep. By the time the puppet soldiers guarding the post discovered the Liberation Army, they had already fallen within the range of the Liberation Army and guerrillas. The panicked puppet soldiers fired indiscriminately into the fields, and tracer bullets flew over the heads of the Liberation Army and guerrillas with strings of red tails. The soldiers ignored them at all and kept rushing forward. The rapidly running footsteps made a "thumping" sound as they stepped on the waterlogged rice paddies. Some soldiers had their gunstocks stained red with blood, but they didn't bother to bandage them and rushed forward in pain. The soldiers thought that as long as they rushed into the village, cut off the enemy's throat and fought, they could eliminate more enemies. A group of soldiers quickly inserted themselves behind the enemy's bunkers, and after a burst of fierce attack, the solid bunkers that had just been spitting out strings of fire immediately turned into scorched earth. As soon as the bunkers were blown up, the soldiers plunged into the village, firing machine guns, submachine guns, and grenades at the enemy's heads. Under the fierce firepower of the Liberation Army and guerrillas, the enemy's defense line was completely submerged. Only the puppet troops were seen screaming and falling in the thick smoke. When the automatic weapons of the Liberation Armed Forces fired again with red light flashing, the puppet Marine Corps abandoned a large number of corpses and guns, and fled desperately in the direction of Saigon.

The offensive battle of An Lu Village was the closest battle to Saigon launched by the Liberation Armed Forces last year, and it was also the first battle in which the main force company of the enemy was annihilated under the city of Saigon. This battle lasted for more than an hour, and completely annihilated two squads of two enemy outposts. The American and puppet troops stationed very close by did not dare to come out to reinforce, they just shrank in their strongholds and fired flares indiscriminately. Just in time, the soldiers of the Liberation Army and guerrillas took advantage of the light of the flares to pick up the enemy's weapons and safely withdraw.

"Is there any need to talk about the future?"

After years of repeated contests, today, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces are getting stronger and stronger, and the battles at the gate of Saigon are getting bigger and bigger. The U.S.-puppet clique shouts every day that the suburbs of Saigon are "absolutely safe zones," but even they themselves don't believe it. Isn't that so? Once evening comes, those personnel of the puppet regime in the suburban "safe zones" that are close to Saigon city dare not spend the night there, and rush into the city to sleep overnight. The five strategic highways connecting Saigon City, some sections can still be used by vehicles during the day, but once evening comes, the highways immediately become deserted areas. In some highways, the liberated areas and guerrilla areas are five hundred meters away on both sides. The U.S.-puppet troops cannot travel freely, but the Liberation Army and guerrillas can travel freely to attack the enemy.

In a small village, we met with the front-line commanders of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area. The commanders here, like the commanders we had seen in other places before, were so strong, simple, and enthusiastic. They put up a map with red dots surrounding blue dots and told us in detail about the course of the battle. "In general," the commander said as if summing up, "the struggle in the suburbs of Saigon is very fierce. U.S. imperialism is crazy, but our people have stood up, armed themselves, and we have gained a foothold. The revolutionary people are the real copper walls and iron fortresses. We have overcome difficulties and are moving towards victory." He paused here and said again, "No matter how vicious and cunning U.S. imperialism is, even if it increases hundreds of thousands more aggressor troops, they cannot reverse the doomed defeat."

"You ask about the future struggle," the commander's eyes shone, and he couldn't help laughing and saying, "Is there any need to talk about the future?!"

I understand the meaning of this loud laughter. Because I have heard this kind of laughter countless times, it is a laughter full of confidence in victory. Now, the American generals huddled in Saigon City can only be anxious. Since the war has already been fought to the gate of Saigon, and since the liberated area is directly approaching the city, then isn't their shouting of "counter-offensive victory" and "the situation is quite good" a ridiculous dream?

I followed the army on Highway 1. At this time, a crescent moon hung on the tips of the bamboo groves. A series of flares were fired from the nearby U.S.-puppet military strongholds. It is said that this is a "defensive measure" taken by the U.S.-puppet troops out of fear of the Liberation Army's night attacks. The highway lay quietly, and the luminous road surface stretched forward. "If we walk along it for two more hours, wouldn't we be in Saigon?" Our hearts were filled with boundless excitement and joy.

### 插在敌人心脏上的一把尖刀  西贡市郊采访记之一

    插在敌人心脏上的一把尖刀
    西贡市郊采访记之一
    “在大炮射程之内”
    我们在西贡市郊采访的那些日子里，从市郊西北走到东南，走过解放区，走过游击区，也走过敌占区。总之，随我们怎么转吧！大白天，刚刚从西贡新山一机场飞起来的美国飞机，看得越来越大；黑夜里，西贡市灯火照射到天空里的反光，看得越来越清。我们问西贡前线指挥部的同志，这里离西贡多远？他满脸笑容地回答：“在大炮射程之内。”
    听了这句话，使人不禁想起，那是一九六一年，美帝国主义多么趾高气扬啊！它凭借着飞机大炮，对赤手空拳的南越人民发动了罪恶的“特种战争”，而五年后的今天，南越解放武装已经进逼到西贡城下，解放区离西贡市区已“在大炮射程之内”。这个事实不正是南越斗争形势发生翻天覆地变化的证明吗？
    英勇的越南南方人民，敢于斗争，善于斗争，他们不仅在山区，在平原，就是在一片平川的西贡近郊也建立并扩大了解放区，沉重地打击了美伪军，使西贡美伪集团的头目们束手无策。
    这里，到处有人民英勇斗争的见证。
    西贡市西北古芝县军民，今年一月的十二天内，同美国侵略军进行了二百多次大小战斗，打死美军一千多。东北郊平新县的许多乡，没有一间房屋、一棵树是不带有弹片伤痕的。东北郊守德县的游击队，在公路上活捉过美国佬。南郊西贡河里，漂流着被游击队炸中的敌军船只的残骸。这里没有前线后方之分。这里没有固定的前线，但到处是歼敌的前线；这里没有固定的战场，但到处是杀敌的战场。解放区的每一寸土地，都是用人民的鲜血和勇敢夺回来的。在这里，日日夜夜，枪炮声始终伴随着我们。
    环绕着西贡市的西贡嘉定地区，有六个县，历来是越南南方政治、军事、经济中心。美帝国主义在发动“特种战争”初期，在广宽的平川上，建起了二百七十多个“战略村”，几乎囚禁了全区的农村人口。敌人的血腥镇压，燃起了人民反抗的怒火。人民在斗争中逐渐懂得：没有武器是打不倒敌人的。仅在一九六三年第四季度里，人民就奋起捣毁了六十多个“战略村”，夺取了三百六十多支枪，武装了自己。西贡城外首次出现了人民战争的堡垒——战斗村。
    西贡嘉定地区燃起的熊熊革命烈火，直接威胁着美伪集团的巢穴——西贡。美伪军妄图扑灭革命烈火，重占解放区，保住西贡，对当地人民进行了残酷镇压。美国侵略军疯狂到了极点。远的不说，仅在今年一月，就出动了八千军队，二百多架飞机，对古芝县北部一地进行了灭绝人性的“扫荡”，一次烧毁了一千五百多间房屋，一万斗粮食。许多村庄的房屋只剩下几根焦黑的柱子，成片的橡胶园和果园，变成了叶落枝枯的死亡林带。美国强盗对一个不到一平方公里方圆的小村庄里，扔下了三百吨炸弹，一夜之间向解放区发射了三千多发炮弹。美国侵略者真比法西斯希特勒更凶恶、更残暴！
    “美国强盗对我们几乎使出了所有的屠杀武器。”中利村的一个老大爷愤愤地对我们说：“但是，他们就是忘记了一点：革命意志和必胜信念是炸不掉、烧不了的。”
    西贡嘉定地区村村武装起来，人人武装起来，广泛地展开游击战，在战斗中壮大、巩固了自己，打击和消灭了敌人，保卫并扩大了解放区。武装到牙齿的美伪军害怕的，正是这些武装起来的革命人民。
    我们走过好些个解放乡。我们看到，就在美国飞机狂轰滥炸和炮火纷飞之下，人们正在填平弹坑，重盖新房。路边庄稼长得非常好，没有荒芜的土地。妇女在矮树丛边摘花生，尽管头顶上美国飞机发出刺耳的尖啸，她们连头都不抬。敌机炸完飞走后，一个老大爷从地洞里爬出来，抖掉头上身上的土，仰望着天空说：“这是第九回炸我的房屋了，我要在原地第十次盖起房屋，炸不死我。”姑娘们沿路摘下野红花，喜欢若狂地迎接我们。乡村教室里仍然书声琅琅。即使是十来岁的孩子，也都能识别敌机的型号。他们侧耳听着炮弹从炮口射出的声音，立刻就能准确无误地告诉你，弹落点将在那里。解放区的交通壕，可以连续走几小时。地道、工事，是村连村，乡连乡。游击队扛着卡宾枪在村边来回走动着……。这一切情景包含着多么坚强的革命意志和胜利的信心啊！
    西贡嘉定地区人民的顽强战斗和解放区的不断发展，不仅直接威胁和打击着美伪集团的老巢——西贡，而且从地面上切断了西贡和其他地区的联系，卡住了美伪军的脖子。西贡嘉定地区解放区，象一把锋利的尖刀，插在敌人的心脏上。
        “把战线推进到西贡城下”
    我们在西贡城下听到的解放武装歼敌的枪声是最动人心弦的。这枪声反映出人民战争的真正威力。
    把人民游击战的战线伸到敌后，逼到敌人脚下去打，这已成为越南南方广泛的、灵活的人民游击战中很明显的特色了。广大的游击队配合地方武装在外线灵活歼敌，解放武装主力则诱敌深入，待机集中歼敌，这就形成了当前南越战场上四面八方夹攻敌人的壮丽景象。
    我们沿着一条可通行大轱辘牛车的沙土路向前走着。附近的美伪军据点里，不时发射出来的炮声，一阵紧一阵，呼啸而过的炮弹在近处橡胶园里炸开了，回响特别大。这时路旁的沙土地上，坐着一排排解放军战士，他们正在休息。有的战士把头枕在重迫击炮炮筒上，伸直双腿仰卧着，若有所思地望着前沿的天边一片灯火的反光；有的战士直着腰，用伪装布抹着新式冲锋枪。
    我们的前进方向是一致的：逼近西贡。不需多问，在微弱的月光下，从战士们坚定而挂满笑容的脸上，他们参加即将来临的战斗的激动心情，无声地传到了我们的心坎里。
      “把战线推进到西贡城下”，这是今天南越人民游击战中光辉胜利的象征。现在，离西贡市最近的战斗有多远？这里的战斗规模怎样？让我先来说说无数次战斗中的一次吧！
    这次战斗发生在去年十一月十八日。战斗地点是离西贡市只有几公里左右的平新县安禄村附近。这次进攻是解放军和游击队主动发起的。
    安禄村在敌后，紧贴在四号公路上。村子四周是一片稻田。这一带离西贡近，守敌多，碉堡岗楼一个接一个，对进攻部队来说，地形并不是很有利的。安禄村里驻有一个伪军海军陆战连，附近村子里，也驻有两连伪军和一批美军。
    入夜，积水的田埂，很滑很难走。战士们摸黑穿行在田间小径上，长长的队伍在迅速移动。寂静的四野里，却听不到一点响声，单凭这一点就可以知道战士们丰富的夜战经验了。
    当解放军和游击队突然出现在敌人面前的时候，有的伪军还在睡大觉。待守岗的伪军发现解放军时，他们早已落进解放军和游击队的射程之内了。着慌的伪军朝田野里胡乱开枪，曳光弹带着一串串红色的尾巴，在解放军和游击队头顶上嗖嗖飞过。战士们根本没有理睬它们，一个劲地往前冲。飞速奔跑的脚步，把稻田里的积水踩得“嗵嗵”作响。有的战士血迹染红了枪托，顾不上包扎，忍着痛往前冲。战士们心想，只要一冲进村，卡住敌人的喉咙打，就能消灭更多的敌人。一部分战士神速地插到敌人的碉堡背后，一阵猛打，刚刚还吐着一串串火舌的坚固碉堡，立刻就变成一片焦土。碉堡刚炸掉，战士们猛插进村，机枪、冲锋枪、手榴弹一股脑儿向敌人头上打去。敌人的防守线在解放军和游击队的强烈火力下，整个淹没了。只见伪军在浓烟滚滚中，叫的叫，倒的倒。当解放武装的自动火器再一次红光闪闪地发射时，伪海军陆战队丢下大批尸体和枪支，没命地往西贡方向溃逃了。
    安禄村的进攻战，是去年解放武装发动的离西贡市最近的一次战斗，也是在西贡城下首次歼敌主力连的战斗。这一仗一共打了一个多小时，全歼伪军两个哨所的两个班。战斗时，距离极近的美伪驻军，都不敢出来增援，他们只是龟缩在据点里，乱打照明弹。正好，解放军和游击队的战士们就趁着照明弹的亮光，捡起敌人的武器，安全撤离了。
          “将来还用说吗”
    经过多年的反复较量之后，今天，越南南方解放武装越来越强大，西贡大门口的战斗越打越大。美伪集团天天叫嚷西贡市郊是“绝对安全区”，可是连他们自己也不敢相信。不是吗？一到傍晚，那些离西贡市区近在咫尺的市郊“安全区”伪政权的人员，不敢在那里过夜，都连夜赶进城睡觉。连接西贡市的五条战略公路，大白天，有几段还能通行车辆，而一到傍晚，公路立刻变成了死寂的地区。有些公路两侧五百米处就是解放区和游击区了。美伪军不能自由来往，而解放军和游击队却可以自由来往，袭击敌人。
    在一个小村落里，我们会见了西贡嘉定地区的前线指挥员们。这里的指挥员，和我们以前在别的地方见过的指挥员一样，都是那么坚强，朴实，热情。他们摆出红点包围蓝点的地图，向我们详细地谈战斗的经过。“总的说来”，指挥员象作总结似的说：“西贡市郊的斗争是十分激烈的。美帝国主义是疯狂的，但是，我们的人民站起来了，武装起来了，我们站住了脚，革命的人民是真正的铜墙铁壁。我们克服了困难，走向胜利。”他说到这里停顿了一下，又说：“美帝国主义再凶恶，再狡猾，即使再增加几十万侵略军，它们也不能扭转注定了的败局。”
      “你们问未来的斗争”，指挥员眼里闪烁着光芒，禁不住笑了起来说：“将来，还用说吗？！”
    我懂得这洪亮的笑声的意思。因为我已经不知多少次听到这种笑声了，这是充满胜利信心的笑声。现在，猬集在西贡城里的美军将领们，只能是干着急。既然仗已经打到了西贡大门口，既然解放区已直逼城下，那末，他们叫嚷的“反攻胜利”，“景况相当好”不是可笑的梦呓吗？
    我随军走在一号公路上。这时，一弯新月挂在竹丛梢头。近处远处的美伪军据点里，射出一连串照明弹。据说，这是美伪军害怕解放军夜间进攻而采取的“防御性措施”哩。公路静静地躺着，发光的路面向前伸展。“如果沿着它再走两个多小时，不就到西贡了吗？”我们心中充满无限的激动和喜悦。
