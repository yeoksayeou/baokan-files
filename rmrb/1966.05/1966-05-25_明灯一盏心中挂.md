    A Bright Lamp Hangs in My Heart
    Soldier Zhou Zhiyong

《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 were given to us,
    I received them with both hands, tears streaming down,
    Chairman Mao and us, heart to heart,
    Together with us, guarding the border post.

《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 were given to us,
    A bright lamp hangs in my heart,
    Giving our all with a red heart for the revolution,
    Full of hatred, killing the enemy.

《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 were given to us,
    Passion surges, strength is immense,
    Lofty aspirations, fearing nothing,
    Daring to pull teeth from the tiger's mouth.

《Quotations from Chairman Mao》 were given to us,
    Lofty ideals take root in our hearts,
    Winds and thunder stir in the five continents and four seas,
    Clear-eyed and bright-minded, cherishing the whole world.

    明灯一盏心中挂
    战士　周志勇《毛主席语录》发给咱，双手接来泪花洒，毛主席和咱心连心，伴咱一道守边卡。《毛主席语录》发给咱，明灯一盏心中挂，掏尽红心为革命，满怀仇恨把敌杀。《毛主席语录》发给咱，激情汹涌力量大，凌云壮志无所惧，老虎嘴里敢拔牙。《毛主席语录》发给咱，崇高理想心里扎，五洲四海风雷激，心明眼亮怀天下。
