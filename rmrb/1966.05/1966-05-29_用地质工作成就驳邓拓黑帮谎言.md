    Deng Tuo, in "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Notes from Three-Family Village," used insidious methods of veiled criticism to attack our Party, oppose socialism, and slander our Great Leap Forward, directing the spearhead straight at the leadership of our Party. After reading it, I was filled with righteous indignation. In order to defend the Party, defend socialism, and defend the world revolution, we must further grasp the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, sharpen our eyes, and resolutely fight Deng Tuo to the end.
    Deng Tuo, closely following behind Khrushchev revisionism and right opportunist elements, viciously cursed our Great Leap Forward as "blowing cowhide" and "talking big." This is a complete slander that ignores the facts. Those who "suffer a bloody nose" in the face of facts are not us, but you. For example, in terms of minerals, during the First Five-Year Plan period, due to the limitations of the Soviet framework, it was wrongly believed that skarn-type copper deposits could not become large mines, and thus there was always a lack of confidence. After the Great Leap Forward, due to breaking superstitions and breaking frameworks, not only were more skarn-type copper deposits found, but practice proved that skarn-type could not only form small mines but also large copper mines. The reserves obtained were more than five times the reserves obtained during the First Five-Year Plan period. Isn't this a Great Leap Forward? Is this "blowing cowhide" or "talking big"? Revisionists, anti-Party elements, your unfounded curses fully prove your emptiness and cannot damage even half a hair of the Great Leap Forward. Our Great Leap Forward has not "failed," but has achieved brilliant victories. We will continue to advance under the guidance of the red flag of the General Line.
    When our Party put forward the socialist economic construction plan, Khrushchev revisionists clamored that "how much truth there is needs to be seen." Deng Tuo immediately followed his baton but could not find an excuse. So, he indulged in fantasy and slandered our socialist construction as "replacing reality with fantasy," "the possessions of one egg," and "completely destroyed." This is utter nonsense. Geological work is the vanguard of our country's economic construction. From the development of geological work, we can also see how our country's socialist economic construction is surging forward under the correct leadership of the Party. Before liberation, during the Kuomintang's rule, there were only more than two hundred people engaged in geological work in our country. The main task was to engage in descriptions of stratigraphy and paleontology, just to decorate the facade for the ruling class. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party, geological work, through great development and great transformation, carried out large-scale general surveys and explorations of minerals needed for socialist economic construction. The number of personnel has increased hundreds of times, and many new instruments and equipment have been built from scratch in large quantities. New technologies and new methods have also been gradually introduced, and we are moving towards the mechanization of general surveys and explorations. The achievements made in just sixteen years are unimaginable and unthinkable before liberation, greatly improving the degree of geological research, initially meeting the needs of national economic construction for minerals, and discovering many new mineral species and deposits. On the basis of these works, some geological and mineral laws have been summarized, enriching and developing the knowledge treasure house of geological science. Some bourgeois foreign and domestic "scholars" said that our country is a "poor oil" country. Now, our oil can basically be self-sufficient. Practice has proved that our country is rich in oil. Our economic construction is constantly growing according to the Party's plan. This has never happened in any dynasty. Only under the leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao can we achieve such great achievements in a short period of time. Deng Tuo wants our Party to "say nothing" and listen to their "guidance" in everything, which is to make us take the revisionist road, allow capitalism to be restored, and restore the backward semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy. This is completely a daydream, and we resolutely do not agree.

    用地质工作成就驳邓拓黑帮谎言
    地质科学研究院矿床研究所所长　郭文魁
    邓拓在《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》里，以指桑骂槐的恶毒手法，攻击我们的党，反对社会主义，污蔑我们的大跃进，把矛头直接指向我们党的领导。看了之后，义愤填膺，为了捍卫党，捍卫社会主义，捍卫世界革命运动，必须进一步掌握毛泽东思想的武器，擦亮眼睛，坚决同邓拓斗争到底。
    邓拓紧跟在赫鲁晓夫修正主义和右倾机会主义分子后面，恶毒地咒骂我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”。这完全是不顾事实的污蔑，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”的不是我们，而是你们。例如在矿产方面，由于大跃进，发现了大量的新的矿床，别的不讲，单就某地区的铜矿而言，在第一个五年计划期间，受苏联框框的限制，错误地认为矽卡岩型铜矿不可能成为大矿，因而总是信心不足。大跃进以后，由于破除迷信，打破框框，不仅找到了更多的矽卡岩型铜矿床，而且实践证明矽卡岩型不只是小型而且亦能形成大型铜矿，所求得的储量约为第一个五年计划期间所求得的储量的五倍有余，难道这不是大跃进吗？难道这是“吹牛皮”“放大炮”吗？修正主义分子，反党分子，你们没有事实根据的咒骂，十足证明你们的空虚，丝毫不能损伤大跃进的半根毫毛。我们的大跃进不但没有“失败”，而是取得了辉煌胜利。我们还要在总路线红旗的指引下，继续前进。
    当我们党提出社会主义经济建设计划时，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者扬言说“有几分真实性需要看看”，邓拓马上紧跟着他的指挥棒打转，但找不到借口，于是就想入非非，污蔑我们社会主义建设是“用空想代替了现实”，“一个鸡蛋的家当”，“全部毁掉了”。这完全是一派胡言。地质工作是我国经济建设的尖兵，从地质工作的发展，也可看出我国社会主义经济建设在党的正确领导下是如何澎湃的前进。解放前在国民党统治时代，我国从事地质工作的仅二百多人，主要工作是搞搞地层古生物的描述，为统治阶级装装门面而已。解放以后，在党的正确领导下，地质工作通过大发展、大转变，大规模开展了社会主义经济建设所需要的矿产的普查勘探工作，人员增加了数百倍，许多新的仪器装备都是从无到有，大量建置，还逐步引用了新技术新方法，正向着普查勘探机械化迈进。短短十六年所取得的成果，是解放前不能想象与不敢想象的，大大提高了地质研究程度，初步满足了国家经济建设对矿产的需要，还发现了许多新矿种与矿床，在这些工作的基础上总结了一些地质矿产规律，丰富与发展了地质科学的知识宝库。一些资产阶级外国与国内“学者”，说我们是“贫油”的国家，现在我们的石油基本上可以自给自足了，实践证明我们的国家是富油的。我们的经济建设正按照党的计划不断地增长，这是历朝历代所没有的，只有在我们党和毛主席领导下，才能在短期内取得这样伟大的成就。邓拓要我们党“什么话都不要说”，一切听他们的“指导”，就是要我们走修正主义道路，让资本主义复辟，恢复那些落后的半封建半殖民地的经济。这完全是白日做梦，我们坚决不答应。
