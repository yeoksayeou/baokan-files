　　Deng Tuo gnashed his teeth and cursed our proletarian dictatorship as "hegemonic," even worse than the feudal tyrants of history, saying that we "make enemies everywhere" and are "unpopular." Indeed, we will not gain your "hearts." Chairman Mao taught us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we will support; whatever the enemy supports, we will oppose." Your frantic opposition proves that we are doing the right thing. You say the proletariat is "hegemonic," well, let me make it clear, we are going to exercise "hegemony" over you demons and monsters; if we listened to you, we would truly be "unpopular."
　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Daolu, First-Class Merit Recipient, Cook班长 of a unit of the Shenyang Troops

　　Deng Tuo viciously attacked the proletarian dictatorship as "hegemonic," wanting us to learn from class enemies and practice so-called "benevolent rule." We want to ask Deng Tuo: Was Chiang Kai-shek's mad slaughter of revolutionary martyrs "benevolent rule"? Is the U.S. imperialism's brutal suppression of revolutionary people today also "benevolent rule"? We also learn from class enemies, that is, to use their own methods to deal with them, to exercise "hegemony" over the enemy. If we practice "benevolent rule" towards the enemy, it would be like Khrushchev, "peaceful coexistence" with the enemy, resulting in the restoration of capitalism, allowing demons and monsters to once again exercise "hegemony" over the working people.
　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhou Taihua, Second Company of a unit of the Kunming Troops

　　Deng Tuo slandered our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," saying that "picking up a chicken egg makes one day dream," and "using fantasy to replace reality." He cursed us for "bumping our heads until they bleed." In the early days of the Great Leap Forward, our factory only had one motor, a windmill, and some dilapidated equipment, which in Deng Tuo's eyes was probably "the property of an egg," but with this "property," we produced the world's first-class quality iron oxide. This is completely reality, where is the fantasy? Facts have proven that it is not us who "bumped our heads until they bleed," but Deng Tuo himself.

　　Khrushchev once cursed us as "three people sharing one pair of pants," and domestic class enemies also cursed us as "poor wretches." Now, Deng Tuo has joined this anti-revolutionary line of cursing, and he also has his own cursing words, he cursed us for "having only the property of an egg" and "destroying it all." It is also a good thing that the enemy curses us for being poor, it makes us often think of the crimes of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that caused our poverty, and also prompts us to work hard in the revolution and change our poor and blank appearance. In the end, it is all the enemies, including Deng Tuo, who will be "completely destroyed."
　　　　　　　　　　　　Xiao Kao, Student of the Engineering Chemistry Department of Tsinghua University

　　If Deng Tuo is not a patient with "amnesia," he should remember: didn't the cloth, cigarettes, matches, kerosene, etc. sold in old China's stores all have the word "foreign" added to them? Even a five-inch pencil was a "foreign pencil." Today, the era of "foreign" goods flooding the market is gone forever, just in our Hefei, there are seven or eight factories that can produce so-called "foreign cloth," are these all "bragged" out of thin air?
　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhang Bichuan, First Store of the Hefei Department Store Company

　　Deng Tuo falsely said that "many ancient great politicians already knew the importance of cherishing labor," and discovered "the limit of using the people's strength." This is nonsense. I have been to Beijing twice and visited the palaces built with the blood and sweat of the working people. In ancient times, in order to enjoy themselves, the feudal ruling class forced the working people to transport wood from Yunnan and Guizhou, thousands of miles away, to Beijing to build three palaces and six courtyards, and countless people died along the way. This is probably the fact that the old society "cherished labor" and the "limit" of "using the people's strength" that you are talking about!
　　　　　　　　　　　　Han Junqing, Chairman of the Poor Association of Anning Commune, Lanzhou

　　In 1958, Chairman Mao put forward the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In the eyes of people like Deng Tuo, this is of course "great empty talk." But we believe that this is the heart of our working class, expressing the ideals and aspirations of our working class. According to Chairman Mao's call, we successfully trial-produced China's first high-precision precision machine tool—optical coordinate boring machine in the second half of 1958. Countless facts have proven that the words of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are not "empty" at all, every sentence is the truth, and every word is worth a thousand gold pieces.

    锄草集
    邓拓咬牙切齿地大骂我们无产阶级专政是“霸道”，比历史上的封建暴君还坏，说什么我们“到处树敌”，“不得人心”。确实，我们是不会得到你们的“心”的。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”你们拼命反对，就说明我们做对了。你说无产阶级是“霸道”，好吧，我就说明白点，我们就是要对你们这伙牛鬼蛇神实行“霸道”，如果我们听了你们的，才会真正的“不得人心”。
        沈阳部队某部一等功臣、炊事班长　张道路
    邓拓恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政是“霸道”，要我们学阶级敌人实行所谓“王道”。我们要问邓拓：过去蒋介石疯狂地屠杀革命志士难道是“王道”吗？今天美帝国主义残酷地镇压革命人民难道也是“王道”吗？我们也学习阶级敌人，就是以其人之道还治其人之身，对敌人实行“霸道”。如果对敌人实行“王道”，就是象赫鲁晓夫一样，跟敌人“和平共处”，结果是使资本主义复辟，让牛鬼蛇神重新对劳动人民实行“霸道”。
                  昆明部队某部二连　周太华
    邓拓污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”，说什么“拾得一鸡卵就想入非非”，“用空想代替了现实”。骂我们“碰得头破血流”。我们厂在大跃进初期只有一台马达，一个风磨和一些破烂设备，这在邓拓看来大概是“一个鸡蛋的家当”吧，可是我们就凭着这点“家当”，生产出了国际上第一流质量的氧化铁。这完全是现实，哪里是空想呢？事实证明，“碰得头破血流”的不是我们正是邓拓自己。
            广州氧化铁厂工人　刘用弢　李顺河
    赫鲁晓夫曾经咒骂我们是“三个人合穿一条裤子”，国内的阶级敌人也曾经咒骂我们是“穷小子”。在这个骂人的反革命行列里，现在又加入了邓拓，他也有他咒骂的词儿，他骂我们“只有一个鸡蛋的家当”，而且“全部毁掉了”。敌人骂我们穷也是一件好事，它使我们经常想到造成我们穷困的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的罪恶，也促使我们努力革命，改变一穷二白的面貌。最后“全部毁掉”的是包括邓拓在内的全部敌人。    清华大学工程化学系学生　萧考
    邓拓如果不是“健忘症”患者的话，他应该记得：旧中国商店里卖的布、烟、火柴、煤油等等，不是都加上个“洋”字么，连五寸长的铅笔也是“洋笔”。今天，“洋”货泛滥的时代已一去不复返了，仅在我们合肥，能生产所谓“洋布”的工厂就有七、八家，难道这些都是“吹”出来的么？
              合肥市百货公司第一商店　张必传
    邓拓瞎说“许多古代的大政治家已经知道爱护劳动力的重要意义”，并且发现了“使用民力的限度”。这是胡说八道。我去过两次北京，参观了用劳动人民的血汗盖起来的宫殿，古代封建统治阶级为了自己享受，强制劳动人民从几千里外的云南、贵州把木头运进北京，修建三宫六院，一路上不知死了多少人。这大概就是你所说的旧社会“爱护劳动力”的事实和“使用民力”的“限度”吧！
              兰州市安宁公社贫协主席　韩俊卿
    一九五八年，毛主席提出了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。在邓拓之流看来，这当然是“伟大的空话”。我们却认为这是我们工人阶级的心里话，表达了我们工人阶级的理想和愿望。我们按照毛主席的号召，在一九五八年下半年试制成功了我国第一台高精度精密机床——光学座标镗床。无数事实证明，党中央和毛主席的话一句也不“空”，句句是实话，字字值千金。
