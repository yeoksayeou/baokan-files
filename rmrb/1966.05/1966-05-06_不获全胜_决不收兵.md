    We Will Never Cease Fighting Until Complete Victory Is Won
    Guo Chang, Air Force Unit of the People’s Liberation Army
    A socialist cultural revolution of great historical significance is unfolding. At first, my understanding of the significance of this revolution was insufficient. I felt that I wielded a gun, and literary criticism was the business of "experts," not our concern. Recently, while studying the *Liberation Army Daily* editorial "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution," I understood that this is not ordinary literary criticism, but a fierce class struggle, a matter of paramount importance concerning the future and destiny of our Party and our country. The anti-Party and anti-socialist articles by Wu Han and others, and the appearance of some bad films, are precisely reflections of this class struggle. These demons and monsters, ghosts and goblins, are nominally "engaged in literature and art," "engaged in academic research," "engaged in filmmaking"; they are "novelists," "playwrights"... In reality, they are spreading bourgeois and modern revisionist ideology, engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Their aim is to disarm us ideologically, destroy socialism, and pave the way for the restoration of the capitalist system. I am a soldier of the People’s Liberation Army. Against the enemies who carry guns, we must wage a real battle with guns and bullets. Against the enemies who do not carry guns, we must also wage a tit-for-tat struggle. Although I don’t understand much about literature and art, and writing articles is very difficult for me, I understand that Mao Zedong Thought is the telescope and microscope for observing and analyzing all problems. I understand that defending the motherland, defending the Party, defending Chairman Mao, and defending the happy life of our people are our sacred duties.
    Mentioning our current happy life cannot help but remind me of life in the old society. My father worked as a porter on the railway from a young age. In 1942, he was captured by the Japanese devils and forced to work as a laborer in the Northeast for two years. At that time, my family was desperately poor. One of my younger sisters died because we couldn’t afford medical treatment and because of hunger. My older brother went mad due to the hardship of family life and still suffers from the aftereffects. My mother passed away soon after due to years of fatigue and anxiety, combined with illness and hunger. After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang came, and my family's miserable life remained exactly the same as before. It was only after the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came that my family saw the light of day. Both of my older brothers joined the Communist Party, and my younger brother joined the workforce after graduating from university. Recalling my past experiences, I will never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and I must never forget the class brothers and sisters in the world who are still suffering.
    The anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in the literary and art circles, dreaming of using the weapon of literature and art to carry out capitalist restoration in our country, this is absolutely not allowed. We must not only continue to grip our guns tightly, but also pick up our pens and actively participate in this socialist cultural revolution. We will never cease fighting until complete victory is won!

    不获全胜　决不收兵
    解放军空军某部　郭锠
    一场具有伟大历史意义的社会主义文化大革命正在展开着。起初，我对这场革命的意义是认识不足的，觉得我是拿枪杆子的，搞文艺批评是“专家”的事情，不是我们的事。最近我带着这个问题，学习了《解放军报》社论《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》，明白了这不是一般的文艺批评，而是一场激烈的阶级斗争，是关系到我们的党、我们的国家的前途和命运的头等大事。吴晗等人反党反社会主义的文章和一些坏电影的出现，正是这种阶级斗争的反映。这些魑魅魍魉、牛鬼蛇神，名义上是“搞文艺的”，“搞学术研究的”，“搞电影的”；是“小说家”，“剧作家”……。其实，他们散布的是资产阶级、现代修正主义思想，搞的是反党反社会主义的勾当。其目的是想解除我们思想上的武装，搞掉社会主义，为恢复资本主义制度开辟道路。我是一个解放军战士，对拿枪的敌人要进行真枪实弹的斗争，对不拿枪的敌人也要进行针锋相对的斗争。我虽然对文艺不太懂，写起文章来也很费力，但是我懂得毛泽东思想是观察分析一切问题的望远镜和显微镜，懂得保卫祖国，懂得保卫党，保卫毛主席，保卫我们人民的幸福生活，是我们的神圣职责。
    提到现在的幸福生活，不由得使我想起旧社会的生活。我父亲从小就在铁路上做搬运工，一九四二年又被日本鬼子抓到东北当了两年劳工。当时我家里穷得不成样子，我的一个小妹妹因为无钱治病，加上饥饿死去了。我的哥哥为了家庭生活的艰难，急得成了疯子，现在还留下了后遗症。我的母亲由于常年劳累、着急，加上疾病和饥饿，不久也去世了。日本投降了，国民党来了，我的家庭的痛苦生活还跟以前一模一样。共产党、毛主席来了，我家才见了天日。我的两个哥哥都参加了共产党，弟弟大学毕业后参加了工作。想起过去的经历，我永远也忘不了共产党和毛主席，也决不能忘记世界上仍在受苦受难的阶级兄弟。
    文艺界的反党反社会主义分子，妄想通过文艺的武器，在我国实行资本主义复辟，这是决不能允许的。我们不仅要继续握紧枪杆子，也要拿起笔杆子，积极参加这场社会主义文化大革命。不获全胜，决不收兵！
