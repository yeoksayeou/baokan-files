    Editor's Note: Comrade Shang Lelin wrote an article in 1964 pointing out that "'Yanshan Yejing' is a bad book that must be criticized" and made a sharp and powerful criticism of the article "Blocking is Worse Than Guiding" in *Yanshan Yejing*. After this article was sent to *Beijing Evening News*, it was returned. After the "Three-Family Village" was thoroughly exposed, the author sent a letter to *Gansu Daily*, along with the article he wrote in 1964 and two letters from *Beijing Evening News*. *Gansu Daily* published all these materials on May 12th, and we are now reprinting them here. From this example, we can see how *Beijing Evening News* covered up Deng Tuo and suppressed criticism.

    *Gansu Daily* Editorial Department:

    Recently, I was very pleased to see in the newspaper the exposure of the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the "Three-Family Village," and the reactionary stance and deceptive tricks of *Qianxian*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News* in covering up Deng Tuo, a ringleader of the "Three-Family Village." Because I had experienced the vile means of the *Beijing Evening News* editorial department in covering up Deng Tuo and suppressing criticism.

    In December 1964, I read Deng Tuo's *Yanshan Yejing* and felt very resentful towards his anti-Party remarks. At that time, I wrote a critical article on his "Blocking is Worse Than Guiding" article and sent it to *Gansu Daily*, stating that if *Gansu Daily* had difficulty handling it, please forward it to *Beijing Evening News*. After the manuscript was forwarded, *Beijing Evening News* sent me a pretentious letter, avoiding any discussion of whether the manuscript was right or wrong, only saying that "whether to start a discussion in the newspaper will be told to you after we check our work." Later, the newspaper returned the manuscript to me, and in the rejection letter, it said: "As for whether to publish it, we will notify you after we decide." After that, there was no further news. Why did they take this attitude? It was not until recently that the newspaper exposed the anti-Party crimes of the Deng Tuo gang and the reactionary stance and deceptive tricks of *Beijing Evening News* in covering up Deng Tuo that I suddenly realized. It turned out that *Beijing Evening News* had long been a tool for the Deng Tuo gang to attack the Party and socialism. They were afraid of exposing Deng Tuo, the big boss of such an anti-Party and anti-socialist black shop, so they adopted deceptive means of suppressing criticism to cover him up. Although they pretended to welcome criticism, in their bones, they were deceiving you into waiting, trying to let time wear down the sharpness of your criticism, to achieve the purpose of covering up the anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang. However, lies cannot deceive people. The Deng Tuo gang has finally been exposed, and the ugly face of *Beijing Evening News* in covering up Deng Tuo has also been exposed. The revolutionary people have seen through their essence, and now it is time to settle accounts with them.

    My original manuscript only revealed the reactionary essence of Deng Tuo's "Blocking is Worse Than Guiding" theory from a philosophical perspective. But today, it seems that this is not enough. Deng Tuo not only served all reactionaries from a philosophical and general perspective, but his fallacies had a huge practical political conspiracy. We know that at that time, it was precisely when our Party was repelling the rampant attacks of right-leaning opportunists, and when anti-socialist black winds such as "going it alone wind" and "san zi yi bao wind" were blowing hard. At this time, Deng Tuo vigorously promoted his "Blocking is Worse Than Guiding" theory, asking us not to "block" "everything," the essence of which was to ask us to abandon the struggle and surrender to the anti-Party and anti-socialist black wind, allowing the anti-Party and anti-socialist "unceasing movement of power" to "develop smoothly." He even taught us: "Blocking" "is wrong" and "doomed to failure," while "actively guiding it to develop smoothly" is "correct." Deng Tuo opened up the road for the "smooth development" of all anti-Party and anti-socialist "unceasing movement of power" at that time, vainly attempting to bring down socialism and restore capitalism. This is the essence of his political conspiracy.

    *Beijing Evening News* has long acted as a tool for Deng Tuo and others to oppose the Party and socialism. After the anti-Party faces of these people were exposed, it tried every means to cover up for them, attempting to muddle through. Now is the time to completely disarm. We will never agree if you do not make a thorough confession.

    Now I am sending the manuscript I wrote in 1964, along with the two reply letters from *Beijing Evening News* refusing to publish it, to your newspaper for your reference. Let us further understand and criticize the ugly faces of the Deng Tuo gang and *Beijing Evening News*.

    With revolutionary greetings,
                                      Shang Lelin
                                    May 10, 1966

    揭露《北京晚报》包庇邓拓压制批评
    编者按：尚乐林同志在一九六四年就写了一篇文章，指出“《燕山夜话》是一部必须批判的坏书”，并对《燕山夜话》中的《堵塞不如开导》一文作了尖锐有力的批判。这篇文章寄给《北京晚报》以后被退回去了。“三家村”被彻底揭露以后，作者给《甘肃日报》寄了一封信，同时把他一九六四年写的那篇文章和《北京晚报》给他的两封信一并寄去。五月十二日《甘肃日报》把这些材料全部发表，现在我们转载在这里。我们可以从这一个事例中，看到《北京晚报》是怎样包庇邓拓压制批评的。《甘肃日报》编辑部：
    最近，看到报上揭露了“三家村”反党反社会主义的罪行，和《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》包庇“三家村”的一个头目邓拓的反动立场及欺骗伎俩，我感到非常高兴。因为我曾领教过《北京晚报》编辑部包庇邓拓、压制批评的恶劣手段。
    一九六四年十二月，我看了邓拓的《燕山夜话》，对他的反党言论非常愤恨。当时我就其中的《堵塞不如开导》一文写了一篇批判文章，寄给《甘肃日报》，并说明《甘肃日报》如果处理有困难，就请转寄《北京晚报》。稿子转去后，《北京晚报》给我来了一封冠冕堂皇的信，闭口不谈稿件的是与非，只说什么“是否在报纸上展开讨论，待我们检查工作以后，再告诉你。”后来该报将稿件给我退回了，在退稿信中又说：“至于是否刊登，等我们决定后再通知你。”此后就再无音讯。他们为什么采取这种态度呢？直到最近报上揭露了邓拓黑帮的反党罪行及《北京晚报》包庇邓拓的反动立场和欺骗伎俩以后，我才恍然大悟。原来《北京晚报》长期以来就是邓拓黑帮向党向社会主义进攻的工具，他们怕把邓拓这样一个反党反社会主义黑店的大掌柜暴露出来，就采取了压制批评的欺骗手段，进行包庇。尽管他们装出一副很欢迎批评的样子，其实骨子里就是骗你等待，企图让时间来磨损你批评者的锐气，达到包庇反党反社会主义黑帮的目的。然而，谎言是骗不了人的，邓拓黑帮终于被揭露了，《北京晚报》包庇邓拓的丑恶面目也被揭穿了。革命人民看透了他们的本质，现在到了向他们算总账的时候了。
    我原来的稿子只从哲学的角度，揭露了邓拓的“堵塞不如开导”论的反动实质。但今天看来，这是不够的。邓拓还不仅从哲学的普遍意义上为一切反动派服务，他发出谬论是有着极大的现实的政治阴谋的。我们知道，当时正是我党击退右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻的时候，正是“单干风”“三自一包风”等反社会主义的黑风大吹的时候。这个时候，邓拓大肆宣扬他的“堵塞不如开导”论，要我们对“一切事物”“都不要堵塞”，其实质就是要我们放弃斗争，向反党反社会主义的黑风屈膝投降，让反党反社会主义的“不停的运动的力量”“顺利发展”。他竟教训我们：“堵塞”“是错误的”，“注定会失败”，“积极开导使之顺利发展”，才是“正确的”。邓拓为当时的一切反党反社会主义的“不停的运动的力量”开辟“顺利发展”的道路，妄图搞垮社会主义，使资本主义复辟，这就是他的政治阴谋的实质所在。
    《北京晚报》长期以来充当邓拓等人反党反社会主义的工具，在这些人的反党面目暴露以后，又千方百计为他们打掩护，企图蒙混过关。现在到了彻底缴械的时候了，你们不作彻底的交代，我们是决不答应的。
    现在我将一九六四年写的那篇稿子连同《北京晚报》拒绝发表的两封复信寄给贵报，供你们参考。让我们更进一步地认识和批判邓拓黑帮及《北京晚报》的丑恶面目。致革命的敬礼
