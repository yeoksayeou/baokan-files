    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 23rd (Report) According to a Cambodia News Agency report on the 22nd, the Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the distorted reporting by the Indonesian newspaper *Social Messenger* on the neutral foreign policy of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The statement said: "*Social Messenger* deliberately deceives Indonesian and international public opinion regarding Cambodian policy."

    The Indonesian newspaper *Social Messenger* once stated in a news item that the Cambodian Ambassador to Indonesia said: "France and People's China should abide by the Moscow Treaty banning nuclear tests," and also that on the issue of "Two Chinas," "Cambodia does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."

    The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement emphasized: "The Cambodian Ambassador could absolutely not make statements that contradict Cambodia's clear and unambiguous position on this matter."

    The statement said: "The Royal Government has not signed the aforementioned treaty, and has clearly stated that Cambodia cannot recognize the nuclear monopoly that certain great powers are attempting to maintain for themselves. Regarding this issue, the Head of State's congratulatory telegram to Chinese leaders after China's recent atomic test fully demonstrates the position of Cambodia and its people."

    Regarding the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas," the statement said: "Such a statement is impossible because everyone knows that in the United Nations General Assembly and on all occasions, Cambodia has consistently and resolutely opposed the so-called 'Two Chinas' concept. Cambodia's position has never changed, and this position has always indicated recognition of the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over the Chinese province of Taiwan, which is unreasonably occupied by the United States and illegally ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek clique."

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 20th (Report) *Cambodia Telegraph* published an editorial on the 20th, vehemently denouncing the recent remarks by Indian Defense Minister Chavan about the so-called "Chinese threat." The editorial said: Deceiving one's own people, selling out the interests of the masses and the country to U.S. imperialism, and suppressing domestic democratic freedoms, these are the conditions that [the Indian ruling group] must possess to act as a pawn of U.S. imperialism.

    The editorial said that it must also be willing to act as a "crusader," pointing its spear at those countries that oppose imperialism, uphold justice, and demand progress.

    The editorial said that Chavan's lies about the "Chinese threat" are "to divert the masses' justified anger at the government's corruption and its incompetence in solving the famine problem." He is attempting to use "inspiring 'patriotism' to make others forget their hunger, which seems to be a tactic used in India today."

    The editorial said: Relying on the scaremongering of "the Chinese danger" "can not only cover up some of the internal difficulties [of India], but also allow more dollars, American food, and American arms to flow in."

    柬外交部驳斥印尼报纸挑拨柬中关系
    重申反对“两个中国”，反对大国核垄断
    柬报谴责印度国防部长以反华叫嚣转移人民不满
    新华社金边二十三日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二十二日报道，柬埔寨外交部就印度尼西亚《社会使者报》对柬埔寨王国政府的中立外交政策进行歪曲报道发表声明。声明说：“《社会使者报》蓄意在柬埔寨政策方面欺骗印度尼西亚和国际舆论。”
    印度尼西亚《社会使者报》曾经在它的一则消息中说什么柬埔寨驻印度尼西亚大使说：“法国和人民中国都应该遵守莫斯科禁止核试验条约”，又说什么在“两个中国”的问题上“柬埔寨不干涉他国内政”。
    柬埔寨外交部的声明强调指出：“柬埔寨大使绝对不可能发表同柬埔寨在这方面明确无误的立场相违背的谈话。”
    声明说：“王国政府并没有在上述条约上签字，并且曾经明确表示，柬埔寨不能承认某些大国企图自己把持的核垄断。对于这个问题，国家元首在中国最近进行原子试验后打给中国领导人的贺电中已完全表明了柬埔寨及其人民的立场。”
    关于制造“两个中国”的阴谋，声明说：“这样的讲话是不可能的，因为大家都知道，在联合国大会上和在一切场合中，柬埔寨始终是断然反对所谓‘两个中国’的说法的。柬埔寨的立场从来没有改变过，这种立场始终表明了承认中华人民共和国对被美国无理霸占和被蒋介石集团非法统治着的中国台湾省的主权。”
    新华社金边二十日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》二十日发表社论痛斥印度国防部长恰范最近说什么“中国的威胁”的谰言。社论说：欺骗本国人民，把人民群众和国家的利益出卖给美帝国主义并且压制国内的民主自由，这些就是（印度统治集团）充当美帝国主义走卒所应具备的条件。
    社论说，它还必须甘愿充当“十字军”，把矛头指向那些反对帝国主义、主持正义和要求进步的国家。
    社论说，恰范关于“中国的威胁”的谎言是“为了转移人民群众对政府的贪污和它在解决饥荒问题上的无能所表示的理所当然的愤怒。”他企图用“激发‘爱国心’，来叫别人忘掉饥饿，看来这就是印度今天用的一种手法。”
    社论说：依靠“中国人的危险”的叫嚣来吓唬人，这“不仅可以掩盖（印度）内部的某些困难，而且还可以使更多的美元、美国粮食和美国军火源源而来。”
