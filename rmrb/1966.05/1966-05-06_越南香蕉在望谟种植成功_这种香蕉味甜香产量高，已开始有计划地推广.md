    Vietnamese bananas, successfully grown in Wangmo, Guizhou Province, by the Subtropical Crop Research Institute, are now being systematically promoted locally, according to Xinhua News Agency in Guiyang.
    Recently, commune members in the Wangmo area, under the leadership of the local Party organization, are utilizing hillside wastelands or empty spaces near villages, houses, and front and back yards to plant Vietnamese bananas. The Pingdong and Sanglang communes alone have transplanted 1,500 to 1,600 banana seedlings in one go.
    Vietnamese bananas are sweet and fragrant, with each plant yielding thirty to forty catties per year, far exceeding the yield of local Wangmo bananas.

    越南香蕉在望谟种植成功
    这种香蕉味甜香产量高，已开始有计划地推广
    据新华社贵阳电　贵州省望谟亚热带作物科学研究所种植成功的越南香蕉，已经开始在当地有计划地推广。
    最近，望谟地区的人民公社社员在当地党组织领导下，正利用山坡荒地或村头寨边、房前屋后空地种植越南香蕉。仅平洞、桑郎两个公社一次就移栽了一千五六百株香蕉苗。
    越南香蕉，味甜而香，每单株年产量可达三四十斤，比望谟当地的香蕉产量高得多。
