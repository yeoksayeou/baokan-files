    We Must Fight
                 Zu Baoquan, Hefei Normal College
    After reading the editorial "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution," I have a further understanding of the new situation in the current class struggle in the ideological field. At the same time, as a literary education worker, I feel even more keenly that we have a serious responsibility in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution.
    What kind of thought to use to arm the younger generation involves the struggle between two classes, two kinds of thought, and two roads. In literary teaching, we will come into contact with some classical Chinese and foreign literary works. But for these things, do we use the "people's nature" theory proposed by bourgeois democrats to cover up the relationship between the exploiting and exploited classes in history and obliterate the boundaries between the thoughts of the exploiting classes and the thoughts of the working people? Or do we use the Marxist viewpoint to criticize them, so as to make the past serve the present and foreign things serve China? Here there is struggle. "The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living." (Marx) We must clear away this feudal, bourgeois, nightmare-like traditional ideological influence, so that we can guide young people to look forward and be creative and develop. In literary teaching, we will also come into contact with things from the 1930s. For those works that glorify the bourgeoisie and portray reactionary capitalists as talented and ambitious heroes against imperialism and feudalism, do we blindly praise them as socialist realism, or do we give these things the criticism they deserve? Here there is also struggle. If we mistakenly regard things that promote bourgeois thought as socialist, then the bourgeoisie and revisionists will applaud from the sidelines, because they are in tune with such thought, combined with each other, and meet their political needs. In literary teaching, do we just talk dryly about our country's socialist revolutionary literary works and then leave it at that? Or do we affirm it with full enthusiasm and discuss it? There is also struggle here. To say that socialist literature and art is crude and to take a cold attitude towards it is not only a matter of personal preference, but actually a matter of stand and emotion. It is, of course, out of tune to treat socialist literary works with bourgeois thoughts and feelings!
    For the continuous development of the socialist cultural cause, we must fight in the face of these problems!
    Educators must first be educated. In order to fulfill our revolutionary duties in the socialist cultural revolution, and in order for the younger generation to receive proletarian revolutionary education, we literary education workers must first transform our thinking and strive to replace the bourgeois world outlook with the proletarian world outlook. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most vibrant Marxism of the present era. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds and transform our world outlook. Only by removing the non-proletarian thoughts in our minds can we undertake the task of educating others. Chairman Mao taught us: "We advocate that intellectuals go to the masses, to the factories, and to the countryside. It would be very bad if they never met workers and peasants in their whole lives." He also said: "To study Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly learn through class struggle, practical work, and close contact with the workers and peasants in order to truly learn." We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go deep into the masses, temper ourselves in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment, and temper ourselves in the current Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, so as to become a thorough revolutionary.
    We are doing things that no one has done before. In the cultural revolution, we must establish the new of socialism, establish the otherness of the proletariat, and create and develop new literature and art that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serves socialism. Every revolutionary literary worker, including literary educators, should actively plunge into the torrent of the socialist cultural revolution and fulfill the glorious historical task entrusted to us by the great Mao Zedong era.

    我们必须战斗

    读了《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》这篇社论，使我对当前意识形态领域里的阶级斗争的新形势有了进一步的认识；同时，作为一个文艺教育工作者，也更加感到我们在社会主义文化大革命中，有着严重的责任。
    用什么思想来武装青年一代，这里就有着两个阶级、两种思想、两条道路的斗争。在文学教学中，我们是要接触一些中外古典文学作品的。但是对于这些东西，是用资产阶级民主主义者所提出的“人民性”的理论来掩盖历史上的剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的关系、泯灭剥削阶级思想和劳动人民思想之间的界限呢？还是用马克思主义的观点加以批判，做到古为今用、外为中用呢？这里就有斗争。“一切已死的先辈们的传统，象梦魔一样纠缠着活人的头脑。”
  （马克思语）我们要清除这种封建的、资产阶级的噩梦似的传统的思想影响，才能引导青年向前看，才能有所创造，有所发展。在文学教学中，我们也要接触三十年代的东西。对于那些美化资产阶级、把反动的资本家写成有才干、有魄力的反帝反封建的英雄的作品，是盲目地称颂它为社会主义现实主义的呢，还是对这些东西给予应有的批判？这里也有斗争。如果错误地把宣扬资产阶级思想的东西当作是社会主义的，那么，资产阶级、修正主义便会在一旁拍手叫好，因为他们同这种思想是同声相求，互为结合的，是符合他们的政治需要的。在文学教学中，我们对于我国社会主义的革命文艺作品，是干巴巴地讲了几句就了事呢？还是满腔热情地肯定它，论述它？这里也是有斗争的。说社会主义文艺是粗糙的，对它抱冷淡态度，这不仅是个个人好恶问题，实际是个立场问题，感情问题。以资产阶级的思想感情来对待社会主义的文艺作品，那当然是格格不入的啊！
    为了社会主义文化事业的不断发展，面对这些问题，我们必须战斗！
    教育者要先受教育。我们文艺教育工作者，为了在社会主义文化革命中尽到自己的革命职责，为了使青年一代受到无产阶级的革命教育，首先必须改造思想，努力用无产阶级世界观来代替资产阶级世界观。毛泽东思想是当代最高最活的马克思主义，我们要用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，改造自己的世界观。我们只有把自己头脑里的非无产阶级思想去掉，才能担负起教育别人的任务。毛主席教导我们说：“我们提倡知识分子到群众中去，到工厂去，到农村去。如果一辈子都不同工人农民见面，这就很不好。”又说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们应当遵循毛主席的教导，深入群众，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼自己，在当前的社会主义文化大革命中锻炼自己，使自己成为一个彻底的革命者。
    我们正在做前人所没有做过的事情。我们要在文化革命中，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，创造、发展为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的新文艺。每个革命文艺工作者，包括文学教育工作者在内，应该积极投入社会主义文化革命的洪流中去，完成伟大的毛泽东时代交给我们的光荣的历史任务。
