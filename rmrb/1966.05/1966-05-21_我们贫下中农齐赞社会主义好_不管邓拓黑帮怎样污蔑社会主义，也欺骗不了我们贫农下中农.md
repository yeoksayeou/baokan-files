    We Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Praise Socialism!
    No Matter How the Deng Tuo Gang Slanders Socialism, They Cannot Deceive Us Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Rao Xingli, Representative of the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association
    After reading the materials of Deng Tuo’s anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, the more I think about it, the angrier I get. They used the guise of discussing history, knowledge, telling stories, and making jokes to maliciously attack our great Chinese Communist Party through innuendo and veiled criticism. He smeared our Party's leadership as "fanatical" and "having a fever," and attacked the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune as "bragging," and "daydreaming, replacing reality with fantasy" and other black talk. He was simply reactionary to the extreme, turning black and white upside down. No matter how your gang attacks and slanders, the historical facts of the Great Leap Forward cannot be smeared. The vast poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought cannot be deceived. We resolutely support the great Chinese Communist Party, support our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and support the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune.
    Our motherland is changing from a state of poverty and blankness. We are building a great socialist power with modernized industry, modernized agriculture, modernized national defense, and modernized science and technology. The cities are prosperous, and the vast countryside is also in excellent shape. This is true for the whole country, for Xishui County, and for the October Brigade where I used to work. After the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, we relied on collective strength to overcome the rare consecutive three years of severe natural disasters, overcame temporary difficulties, and achieved a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. We carried out large-scale farmland capital construction, built water conservancy projects, and transformed poor mountains and bad rivers. Xishui County built the Bailianhe Hydropower Station, dug through the east-west canals irrigating the entire county, and achieved water conservancy, basically ensuring stable yields despite drought or flood for the county’s 450,000 mu of paddy fields. In terms of the October District, ten large and medium-sized reservoirs were built, and a 15-kilometer-long river channel was harnessed, ensuring stable yields despite drought or flood for more than 80,000 mu of paddy fields in the entire district. On the basis of realizing water conservancy, we are also moving towards agricultural mechanization and electrification. The October Brigade alone has 41 agricultural machines, with 466 horsepower. In 1965, the total grain output of the entire brigade increased by more than two times compared with 1951, and the output of other crops also increased significantly. Collective accumulation has continued to increase, the collective economy has become more consolidated, contributions to the country have continued to increase, the lives of commune members have gradually improved, the average per capita net income in 1965 was 128 yuan, the labor intensity of commune members has been greatly reduced, and everyone is full of energy and has a new mental outlook. Everyone is determined to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, farm for the revolution, and build a new socialist countryside.
    Deng Tuo, who speaks black talk, aren’t the facts I have listed above a victory for the Party's wise leadership and Mao Zedong Thought? Aren't they victories of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune? Why do you turn black and white upside down? You ghosts and monsters have ulterior motives, trying to overthrow the Party's leadership, undermine socialism, and restore capitalism. Your conspiracy will never succeed, and you can never escape the people's dragnet. The vast poor and lower-middle peasants in our province must strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, raise awareness, stand firm, open our eyes, and resolutely wage a resolute struggle against Deng Tuo and other small handful of ghosts and monsters. We will never stop until we win a complete victory!

    我们贫下中农齐赞社会主义好
    不管邓拓黑帮怎样污蔑社会主义，也欺骗不了我们贫农下中农
    全国人民代表大会代表湖北省贫下中农协会副主席  饶兴礼
    看了邓拓的反党反社会主义的材料后，越想越气愤。他们以谈历史、谈知识、讲故事、说笑话作幌子，借古骂今，指桑骂槐，对我们伟大的中国共产党进行恶毒的攻击。他污蔑我们党的领导是“狂热”“发高烧”，攻击总路线、大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“想入非非，用空想代替现实”等黑话，简直是反动透顶，颠倒黑白。不管你们一伙黑帮怎样攻击污蔑，大跃进的历史事实，是污蔑不了的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农，是欺骗不了的。我们坚决拥护伟大的中国共产党，拥护我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，拥护总路线、大跃进、人民公社。
    我们的祖国正在改变一穷二白的面貌。我们正在建设现代化的工业、现代化的农业、现代化的国防和现代化的科学技术的伟大社会主义强国。城市一片繁荣，广大农村也是一片大好形势，全国是这样，浠水县是这样，我原来工作的十月大队也是这样。一九五八年人民公社成立以后，在党的领导下，我们依靠集体力量战胜了历史上少有的连续三年严重自然灾害，克服了暂时的困难，农业生产实现了大跃进。我们大搞了农田基本建设，兴修水利，改造了穷山恶水，浠水县建成了白莲河水力发电站，挖通了灌溉全县的东西两条渠道，实现了水利化，使全县四十五万亩水田基本上旱涝保收。从十月区来说，兴建了十座大中型水库，治理了全长十五公里的河道，全区八万多亩水田旱涝保收，并在实现水利化的基础上，又向农业机械化电气化迈进。光是十月大队就有农业机械四十一台，四百六十六马力。一九六五年全大队的粮食总产比一九五一年增产两倍多，其他作物产量也是大幅度增加。集体积累不断增加，集体经济更加巩固，对国家贡献不断增多，社员生活逐步改善，分配纯收入一九六五年每人平均一百二十八元，社员劳动强度大大减轻，人人干劲十足，精神面貌一新。大家决心读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，为革命种田，建设社会主义新农村。
    说黑话的邓拓，我列举的上述事实，难道不是党的英明领导和毛泽东思想的胜利吗？不是总路线、大跃进、人民公社的胜利吗？你为什么要颠倒黑白？你们这些牛鬼蛇神别有用心，妄想推翻党的领导，搞垮社会主义，使资本主义复辟。你们的这种阴谋决不能得逞，你们休想逃脱人民的天罗地网。我们全省广大贫下中农，要加强学习毛主席著作，提高觉悟，站稳立场、擦亮眼睛，坚决向邓拓等一小撮牛鬼蛇神作坚决的斗争，不获全胜，决不收兵！
