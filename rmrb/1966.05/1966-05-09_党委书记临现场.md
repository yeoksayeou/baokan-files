    Party secretary on the scene
    A pair of coarse arms, hands dirty,
    Sweat soaking through his canvas clothes,
    White hair standing by the furnace—
    A Party secretary on the scene!
    The secretary is an "Old Taihang,"
    Shoulders carried the arsenal before—
        Crossed mountains and rivers to repair guns and knives,
        Shoveling flat the Three Mountains, the blade still not damaged!
    Look at him swinging the hammer like lightning,
    Ten years and he doesn't forget his old trade,
    His arm waving like raising a flag,
    The hammer falling, pounding a thousand times.
    He doesn't frown at great difficulties,
    Searching for treasure inside the workshop:
    Eating at the same table as us,
    Sleeping on the same kang with us.
    Holding a meeting by the furnace:
    Discussing everything with the masses;
    How many heartfelt things in his chest,
    All willing to openly tell him...
    Different names, no wall between,
    The wisdom of the masses gathered into an ocean,
    New resolutions at the Party committee meeting,
    Initially born by the furnace!
    During breaks, he is even busier,
    Everyone wants to pour out their hearts to him,
    Golden key to unlock rusty locks,
    Poking straight to the heart!
    Party secretary on the scene,
    Swinging the hammer, singing loudly,
    Singing the good news pasted all over the wall,
    Singing the hearts of everyone surging!

    党委书记临现场一双粗臂两手脏，汗水浸透帆布装，白发苍苍炉边站，——党委书记临现场！书记是个“老太行”，肩膀挑过兵工厂——穿山涉水修枪刀，三山铲平刃未伤！瞧他抡锤似闪电，十年不忘老本行，胳膊一挥象扬旗，锤落咚咚千声夯。天大困难不皱眉，车间里边寻宝藏：吃饭和咱共一桌，睡觉和咱一条炕。炉旁齐开碰头会：事事和群众同商量；胸中多少贴心事，都愿敞口向他讲……姓名不同没有墙，群众智慧聚成洋，党委会上新决议，最初诞生在炉火旁！休息间隙他更忙，都愿找他诉衷肠，金子钥匙开锈锁，下下捅到心坎上！党委书记临现场，大锤蹦着高声唱，唱得喜报贴满墙，唱得人人心潮涨！
