    Trust the Party for Generations
    Deng Tuo Provokes the Relationship Between the Party and the Masses; Our Answer Is: A Hundred Trusts, a Thousand Trusts, Ten Thousand Trusts in the Party; Trust It Forever for Generations to Come
    National Grain System Model Worker Rong Xianjie
    After reading the reactionary remarks of Deng Tuo and a handful of other anti-Party, anti-socialist elements viciously attacking the Party and socialism, I was almost bursting with anger. You a bunch of demons and monsters, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, but peddling revisionism, chanting "telling stories" and "passing on knowledge," but actually spreading the poison of capitalism. You are truly a pack of wolves with smiles on your faces, hiding knives in your smiles, killing without bloodshed.
    Deng Tuo slandered our Party as "breaking its own word" and "unworthy of trust." This is purely opening his eyes and talking nonsense. Anyone with even a little revolutionary feeling understands that it was the great Chinese Communist Party and the beloved Chairman Mao who led the Chinese people to defeat the three great enemies, and only then did the working people gain liberation and live a happy life.
    I will never forget the suffering of the old society. I remember before liberation, our family of four, grandfather, father, and mother, worked the land for the landlord. Every day, we got up before dawn and worked until late at night, toiling from spring to autumn, but we still couldn't feed the four of us. The year my mother gave birth to me, we didn't even have a rag for a diaper. We had no choice but to tear up the pillow to use as a diaper. In fact, in the old society, there were millions upon millions of working people who suffered, and which family didn't live a miserable life of eating chaff and vegetables for half the year! How can a true working person forget the painful past? Only you, Deng Tuo, and your small group can ignore the past of the working people. After liberation, our family, like other working people, lived a happy life. I have now joined the revolutionary work, and my three younger sisters have entered school. My personal experience has made me understand: the Communist Party is the reborn mother of the working people, and Chairman Mao is our savior. Without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, how could a child from a poor family like me have survived to this day? Today, the working people have not only turned over economically, but also become masters of the house and hold the seal of state. May I ask, if you look through the history of China, which dynasty or generation of working people have been masters of the house?
    Our Party is a party that serves the people, which is determined by the nature of our Party; maintaining close ties with the masses and caring about the lives of the masses is the fine tradition of our Party. The Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught all our Party members and revolutionary cadres to serve the people wholeheartedly, to care not only about world affairs and national affairs, but also about the daily lives of the broad masses of the people. In order to better serve our customers and provide them with various conveniences, our grain store is working hard to improve our basic skills, so that selling grain and weighing scales are both accurate and fast; so that customers do not have to queue up and spend more time. For families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers or households with difficulties buying grain outside, we deliver the grain to their door; we also prepare in advance the types of grain that mothers like to eat after giving birth. The masses said with emotion: "You are good service personnel educated by Chairman Mao, and good girls cultivated by the Party." Please see, the relationship between our Party and the masses is so heartfelt and as close as fish and water. Deng Tuo, your vicious attack on our Party, attempting to provoke the relationship between the Party and the masses, I tell you this is a daydream. The more you anti-Party and anti-socialist elements attack our Party and slander our Party, the more it shows that our Party is doing the right thing. Our Party deserves to be called a great party, a glorious party, and a correct party. We have a hundred trusts, a thousand trusts, ten thousand trusts in such a party, we trusted it in the past, we trust it now, and we will trust it forever for generations to come.

    子孙万代信任党
    邓拓挑拨党和群众的关系，我们的回答是：对党一百个信任，一千个信任，一万个信任，子孙万代永远信任
    全国粮食系统标兵　荣先杰
    看了邓拓一小撮反党反社会主义分子恶毒地攻击党、攻击社会主义的反动言论，我差点把肺都气炸了。你们这群牛鬼蛇神，打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马列主义外衣，贩卖的却是修正主义，口唱“讲故事”、“传知识”，实际散布的是资本主义的毒素。你们真是一群笑里藏刀、杀人不见血的豺狼。
    邓拓诬蔑我们党“自食其言”、“不堪信任”，这纯粹是睁着眼睛说瞎话。凡是有一点革命感情的人都懂得，是伟大的中国共产党和敬爱的毛主席领导中国人民打垮了三大敌人，劳动人民才得到了翻身解放，过上了幸福生活。
    提起旧社会的苦，我是永远忘不了的。记得解放前，我们一家四口人，祖父、父亲和母亲三个人给地主种地，每天都是起五更，爬半夜，从春忙到秋，可是还养不起四口人。妈妈生我那年，连个破尿布都没有。没有办法，只好把枕头撕破了当尿布。其实在旧社会里，受苦受难的劳动人民有千千万万，哪一家过的不是糠菜半年粮的悲惨生活！一个真正的劳动人民，怎么能忘记过去的痛苦遭遇呢？只有邓拓你们这一小撮人，才会无视劳动人民的过去。解放后，我们家同其他劳动人民一样，过上了幸福生活。我现在已经参加了革命工作，三个妹妹进了学校。我的切身经历使我懂得：共产党是劳动人民的再生母亲，毛主席是我们的救命恩人，没有共产党，没有毛主席，象我这样一个穷苦人家的孩子怎么能够活到现在呢？今天，劳动人民不光是在经济上翻了身，还当家作主，掌握了国家的印把子。请问，翻开中国的历史看一看，哪一朝哪一代劳动人民当过家作过主呢？
    我们的党是为人民服务的党，这是我们党的性质所决定的；密切联系群众，关心群众生活，这是我们党的优良传统。党和毛主席一再教导我们全体党员和革命干部，要全心全意为人民服务，既要关心世界大事、国家大事，也要关心广大人民群众的日常生活。我们粮店为了更好地为顾客服务，给顾客提供各种方便，大家都在苦练基本功，做到卖粮称秤既准又快；做到不让顾客排队，多花费时间。对烈军属或出外买粮有困难的户，我们就把粮食送上门去；产妇喜欢吃的粮食品种，也都提前准备好。群众感动地说：“你们是毛主席教育出来的好服务员，党培养的好姑娘。”请看，我们的党和群众的关系，就是这样心连着心，鱼水相亲。邓拓，你恶毒的攻击我们的党，企图挑拨党和群众的关系，告诉你这是白日作梦。象你们这些反党反社会主义分子，越是攻击我们党，诬蔑我们党，越说明我们的党做的对。我们的党不愧为伟大的党，光荣的党，正确的党。对这样的党，我们一百个信任，一千个信任，一万个信任，过去信任，现在信任，将来子孙万代永远信任。
