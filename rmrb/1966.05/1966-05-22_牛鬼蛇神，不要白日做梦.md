    Demons and Monsters, Stop Daydreaming
    Five-Good Soldier Yang Hongxin
    The movie "Stage Sisters" is a poisonous weed. In the socialist era, what is the intention of the director and screenwriter to move the bourgeois stuff of the 1930s onto the screen without any changes? I think there is only one purpose, and that is to try to corrupt our younger generation by promoting the bourgeois lifestyle, the bourgeois theory of human nature, and the bourgeois individual struggle, in a vain attempt to realize capitalist restoration.
    We are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we love to watch revolutionary movies because they can inspire our revolutionary drive. Every time we watch, we gain more revolutionary ambition, increase our love for the people and the Party, and deepen our deep-seated hatred for the enemy! However, when I watched the movie "Stage Sisters," all I heard was decadent music, and all I saw were some ugly bourgeois things and a rotten lifestyle. The film's director and screenwriter have racked their brains to dress up the ugly things in a flamboyant way, trying to weaken our revolutionary will and make us give up the revolutionary struggle. We will never agree!
    This film attempts to guide people to take the bourgeois road of individual struggle. In the film, the protagonist, Zhu Chunhua, works diligently and studies hard all day long, following Master Xing's teaching of "being a decent person and performing opera seriously." Therefore, when they entered the bustling world of Shanghai, they suddenly rose to prominence and became famous actors who caused a sensation in Shanghai with their outstanding talents and superb singing skills. From then on, they wore beautiful clothes, received large sums of money, and became seemingly inviolable. Although the director and screenwriter finally forced Zhu Chunhua to embark on the revolutionary road, it is not difficult for discerning people to see that this is just a smokescreen.
    This film is telling us: Study your profession seriously! As long as you have solid skills and persist in individual struggle, you will have fame and fortune. "Stage Sisters" directors and screenwriters: Do you want us to "turn a deaf ear to what is happening outside the window, and concentrate only on studying the books of sages?" Do you want to disarm us ideologically? Do you want to carry out "peaceful evolution" and lead us down the black path of capitalism? This is a daydream! We have grown up under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought and under the cultivation of the Party. We have only one supreme wish, and that is: not for fame, not for profit; not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death; wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people. Your small handful of bourgeois spokespersons want to play tricks in front of us, but it will not lead to any results.

    牛鬼蛇神，不要白日做梦

    电影《舞台姐妹》是一棵毒草。在社会主义时代，把三十年代的资产阶级货色原封不动地搬上银幕，编导者居心何在？我认为目的只有一个，那就是企图通过宣扬资产阶级的生活方式，资产阶级的人性论和资产阶级的个人奋斗，来腐蚀我们青年一代，妄想实现资本主义复辟。
    我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，我们最爱看的是革命电影，因为它能鼓舞我们的革命干劲。每看一次，就长一分革命志气，增加一分对人民和党的热爱，加深一分对敌人的刻骨仇恨！但是，当我看《舞台姐妹》这部电影的时候，听到的只是靡靡之音，看到的只是一些资产阶级丑恶的东西和腐烂的生活方式。影片编导者费尽心机，把丑的东西打扮得花枝招展，企图以此来削弱我们的革命斗志，让我们放弃革命斗争，我们决不答应！
    这部影片企图引导人们去走个人奋斗的资产阶级道路。影片里的主人公竺春花，由于按照邢师傅“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”的教导，终日勤学苦练。因此，当她们走进花花世界上海之后，凭着自己出众的天姿，超人的唱技，陡然飞黄腾达地成了轰动上海的名演员。从此，她们穿上了漂亮的衣着，拿上了大笔的金钱，变得俨然不可侵犯。虽然编导者最后硬让竺春花走上了革命的道路，但明眼人不难看出，这不过是放放烟幕而已。
    这部影片是在告诉我们：认认真真地钻研业务吧！只要技术过得硬，坚持个人奋斗，什么名利地位就都有了。《舞台姐妹》的编导者们：你们想让我们“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”吗？想在思想上缴我们的械吗？想实行“和平演变”，让我们走资本主义的黑路吗？这是白日做梦！我们是承受毛泽东思想的雨露、在党的培养下长大的，我们只有一个最高愿望，那就是：不为名，不为利；不怕苦，不怕死；一心为革命，一心为人民。你们这一小撮资产阶级的代言人想在我们面前耍弄花招，是不会有什么结果的。
