    Demolish the Black Shop, Repel the Evil Wind, Thoroughly Revolutionize
    We Must Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Take the Lead and Be Pioneers in the Class Struggle in the Ideological Field
    Wei Xiaotang, Deputy to the National People's Congress, Combat Hero
    Deng Tuo and his ilk clamor arrogantly for our Party to step down and "rest," for us not to speak, not to work, not to make revolution. This is a pipe dream! The sun must shine, the earth must rotate, the wheels of history must turn, and we must always make revolution. How many revolutionary martyrs shed their blood, sacrificed their heads, and gloriously dedicated themselves for today's victory. Can we allow Deng Tuo and a handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements to swallow the socialist country we built with our blood and lives? Can we allow you to curse it down and overturn it? Don't even think about it!
    Deng Tuo, it's impossible for you to stop us from speaking. We must speak! We will never allow you to slander the Party, attack socialism, or spew blood. We will speak, we will expose your true colors, and knock out your venomous fangs. In the old society, you didn't allow us to speak. My father and mother starved to death, with no place to voice their full bellies of hatred; my uncle suffered the exploitation of the exploiting class, forced to pay taxes and grain, cruelly beaten, and forced to throw himself into the Fen River, with no place to cry injustice. In the old society, "The yamen gate opens southward, justice is for those with money, not reason," where could we go to speak! When the Party and Chairman Mao came, the working people had a place to speak. We have so many words of gratitude to say to the Party and Chairman Mao! We have so many words of anger to shoot like bullets at the class enemies!
    The old society turned people into ghosts, and the new society turned ghosts into people. This is absolutely true. It was under the Party's care and education that I learned to speak and to understand revolutionary principles. When I first walked into the Great Hall of the People, hot tears streamed down my face. Only today, a shepherd boy like me, and so many other suffering people, can speak before the people of the whole country, and become masters of the country. The Party lets us speak, and we listen to the Party the most. The Party's words, Chairman Mao's words, are the words in the hearts of our people, one sentence worth ten thousand, with the highest prestige. The words our Party says on the international stage of struggle are like a resounding bugle call echoing around the globe, encouraging the revolutionary people and frightening imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries. Deng Tuo and his ilk vainly hope to prevent our Party from speaking because they, a handful of demons and monsters, are afraid of our Party's words like they are afraid of being struck by lightning!
    Deng Tuo! It's impossible for you to stop us from working. We must work! We will pick up the iron broom and sweep you, this group of dregs, away. The Party and Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and established the new China, achieving brilliant results in socialist revolution and construction. Since the Great Leap Forward, following the Party's teachings and holding high the great red banner of the General Line, our motherland's revolution and construction have changed with each passing day. We overcame the temporary difficulties brought by three consecutive years of natural disasters and reaped bumper harvests. The oil problem that the revisionists asserted we could not solve, we solved. The 12,000-ton hydraulic press was manufactured, and three nuclear explosions were successful. These great achievements shook the whole world. People's lives are constantly improving. We have achieved one brilliant victory after another on all fronts. Is this "an egg's worth of belongings" that have been "completely destroyed"? You have black hearts and speak black words. Your opposition to the General Line and the Great Leap Forward is because you fear the socialist revolution will become more profound, shattering your daydream of restoring capitalism!
    "Three-Family Village's" demons and monsters, we must never listen to your "guidance," never allow revisionists and right-leaning opportunists to come to power, never allow capitalism to be restored in China, and never allow you to ride on the necks of us working people again! The Party is our dear mother, and we are inextricably linked to the Party. The dictatorship of the proletariat is our lifeline. If we don't exercise dictatorship over you, you will exercise dictatorship over us. There is no "benevolent rule" or "benevolent government" to talk about with you; towards you, we must implement "hegemony," we must implement dictatorship. We must thoroughly demolish your "Three-Family Village" black shop and repel the evil wind that blows out of the black shop.
    I still deeply remember the words of a comrade-in-arms before his death: "We must fight the enemy to the end!" Yes! We must fight all class enemies to the end! We must, like we did when we defended Yan'an, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead and be pioneers in the class struggle in the ideological field, resolutely fight you, this group of enemies without guns, to the end, and never withdraw until complete victory!

    捣毁黑店　击退妖风　彻底革命
    我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在意识形态领域的阶级斗争中打头阵，当尖兵
    全国人民代表大会代表、战斗英雄　卫小堂
    邓拓之流狂妄地叫喊要我们党下台“休息”，要我们不说话，不做事，不革命，这是白天做梦！太阳要照耀，地球要运行，历史的车轮要转动，我们永远要革命。多少革命先烈为了今天的胜利，洒热血、抛头颅，光荣献身。我们用鲜血和生命打出来的社会主义江山，能让邓拓一小撮反党反社会主义分子吞掉吗？能让你们骂倒、反掉吗？别妄想！
    邓拓，你想要我们不说话是办不到的，我们不说是不行的！我们决不让你谩骂党、攻击社会主义，血口喷人。我们要说，我们要揭你的底，敲掉你的毒牙。在旧社会你们是不准我们说话的，我的父亲母亲活活饿死，没有地方诉说满腹的仇恨；我的叔叔受尽了剥削阶级逼税逼粮、残酷吊打，被迫投入汾河，也没有地方喊冤。在旧社会，“衙门八字朝南开，有理无钱莫进来”，我们去哪里说话呀！党和毛主席来了，就有我们劳动人民说话的地方了。我们有多少感激的话要对党和毛主席说啊！我们又有多少愤怒的话要象子弹一样地射向阶级敌人！
    旧社会把人逼成鬼，新社会把鬼变成人，这是一点不假的。我就是在党的关怀教育下才学会说话的，才会讲革命道理的。当我第一次走进人民大会堂的时候，热泪直往下掉。只有今天，我这样一个放羊的孩子，和许许多多受苦人，才能够在全国人民面前说话，才成了国家的主人。党让我们说话，我们也最听党的话。党的话、毛主席的话就是我们人民心里的话，一句顶一万句，威信最高。我们党在国际斗争舞台上说的话，更是象响亮的军号响彻全球，使革命人民感到鼓舞，使帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派害怕。邓拓之流妄想不让我们党说话，是因为他们这一小撮牛鬼蛇神，怕我们党的话就象怕雷劈！
    邓拓！你不要我们做事，也是办不到的，我们不做是不行的。我们要拿起铁扫帚来把你们这群残渣打扫出去。党和毛主席领导我们推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，建立了新中国，在社会主义革命和建设中取得了辉煌的成绩。大跃进以来，我们按照党的教导，高举总路线的伟大红旗，祖国的革命和建设事业更是日新月异。我们克服了连续三年自然灾害带来的暂时困难，夺来了丰收。修正主义断言我们无法解决的石油问题，我们解决了。一万二千吨水压机制造出来了，三次核爆炸成功了。这些伟大成就，震动了全世界。人民生活不断改善。我们在各个战线上取得一个又一个的辉煌胜利，难道是“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”吗？你们长的是黑心，说的是黑话，你们反对总路线、大跃进，是怕社会主义革命更加深入，打破你们复辟资本主义的白日梦！
    “三家村”的牛鬼蛇神们，我们决不能听你们的“指导”，决不能让修正主义、右倾机会主义分子上台，决不能让资本主义在中国复辟，决不能让你们再骑在我们劳动人民的脖子上！党是我们的亲娘，我们和党是血肉不可分的。无产阶级专政是我们的命根子，我们不专你们的政，你们就要专我们的政。对你们，没有什么“王道”和“仁政”好讲的；对你们，就是要实行“霸道”，就是要实行专政。我们要彻底捣毁你们的“三家村”黑店，击退黑店刮出来的妖风。
    我至今还深深地记得，一位战友在临终前说的话：“一定要和敌人拼到底！”对！我们一定要和一切阶级敌人斗到底！我们要象当年保卫延安一样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在意识形态领域的阶级斗争中，打头阵，当尖兵，坚决和你们这群不拿枪的敌人战斗到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
