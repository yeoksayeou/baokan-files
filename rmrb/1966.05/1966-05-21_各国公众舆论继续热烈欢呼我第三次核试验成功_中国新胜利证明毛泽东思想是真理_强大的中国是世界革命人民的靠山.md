    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th – Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, received a letter from Ibrahim Issa, representative of Indonesia to the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and Secretary-General of the Indonesian Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, congratulating China on the success of its nuclear explosion.

    The letter stated: "This significant and brilliant achievement of the Chinese people is the result of the correct and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, as well as the diligent and arduous labor of the scientists and armed forces of the People's Republic of China. The Indonesian people view this great achievement as their own, as well as the achievement of the Asian, African, and Latin American people in struggle."

    The letter said that China's nuclear test broke the nuclear monopoly of imperialism headed by the United States and its accomplices. China's progress in nuclear capability has further inspired the world's people to fight against the aggression and domination of US imperialism and to strive for complete national independence.

    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, May 19th – The General Confederation of Labor of Cameroon, in a congratulatory letter delivered to the Chinese Embassy in Guinea on May 19th, warmly congratulated China on the success of its nuclear test containing thermonuclear materials.

    The letter stated: "Your previous two nuclear victories aroused great hope among the people of various countries, and this latest victory has given them firm confidence. When we think that the science related to such nuclear weapons is now completely in the hands of the Chinese people, led by a glorious party and Chairman Mao Zedong, we peace fighters around the world are filled with unwavering confidence that our struggle against the imperialist aggressors and exploiters will ultimately be victorious, and that the world people's revolution will surely triumph."

    The letter went on to say that the success of China's nuclear explosion is another great victory for the Chinese people in socialist construction and continuing to strengthen national defense. The letter stated: "We would like to extend our warmest congratulations to the hardworking Chinese people, to all the workers and scientific workers in China on this event." "We also want to congratulate the leaders of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, whose thought has enabled the great Chinese people to make such a decisive contribution to the cause of peace and the world revolution."

    The letter pointed out that this new great victory of China in the nuclear field completely broke the nuclear monopoly, nuclear blackmail, and nuclear superstition of US imperialism and its accomplices.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Khai, May 20th – The Lao newspaper *Torch* published a commentary on May 20th entitled *The Success of China's Nuclear Test is the Success and Victory of the World's Oppressed People*, warmly congratulating China on the success of its third nuclear test.

    The commentary said that the success of China's third nuclear test "once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the 650 million Chinese people, united as one, have built their country through self-reliance and have achieved comprehensive successes, becoming a model for the world.

    The commentary said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the common wealth of the world's people," and "the success of China's nuclear test is the success and victory of the world's oppressed people."

    The commentary said, "A powerful China is the most reliable backing for the world's freedom-loving people. We deeply realize that among the countries possessing nuclear weapons, only the People's Republic of China truly defends world peace." Therefore, the success of China's third nuclear test "gives great encouragement to the people of all countries in the world who are resisting the aggression of US imperialism."

    The Lao newspaper *Youth Daily* published an editorial on May 14th, stating: "China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials makes all peace-loving people in the world, especially the three million Lao people, feel extremely happy and encouraged, and makes US imperialism and its servants tremble with fear, because this is a nuclear weapon that defends world peace and completely shatters the nuclear monopoly of US imperialism."

    The editorial said that this achievement "proves that the line of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Mao Zedong is very correct and wise, and reflects that China has become very strong in all aspects since the Chinese people were liberated."

    The *Youth Daily*'s editorial said, "The success of this Chinese nuclear test has further strengthened the determination of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, especially the people of Indochina, to fight against US imperialism and new and old colonialism."

    新华社科纳克里十九日电  喀麦隆劳工总联合会十九日在科纳克里交给中国驻几内亚大使馆的一封贺信中，热烈祝贺中国含有热核材料的核试验的成功。
    贺信说：“你们前两次的核胜利在各国人民中间激起了巨大的希望，最近这一次的胜利使他们有了坚定的信心。当我们想到，有关这种核武器的科学从此完全掌握在由一个光荣的党和毛泽东主席领导的中国人民的手中时，我们全世界的和平战士就满怀坚定不移的信心，坚信我们反对帝国主义侵略者和剥削者的斗争最后一定获得胜利，坚信全世界人民革命一定会胜利。”
    贺信接着说，中国这次核爆炸的成功，是中国人民在社会主义建设和继续加强国家防御方面所取得的又一个伟大的胜利。贺信说：“我们要就这一事件，向勤劳的中国人民，向中国所有的劳动者和科学工作者致以最热烈的祝贺。”“我们还要向中国的领导人以及毛泽东主席表示祝贺，是毛泽东主席的思想使伟大的中国人民对和平事业和世界革命作出这样有决定性的贡献。”
    信件指出，中国在核领域的这一新的伟大胜利，完全打破了美帝国主义及其帮凶的核垄断、核讹诈和核迷信。
    新华社康开二十日电　老挝《火炬报》二十日发表题为《中国核试验的成功是全世界被压迫人民的成功和胜利》的评论，热烈祝贺中国第三次核试验成功。
    评论说，中国第三次核试验成功，“再一次证明毛泽东思想是真理”。六亿五千万中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下，团结一致，自力更生建设自己的国家，获得了全面的成就，成为世界的典范。
    评论说，“毛泽东思想是世界人民共同的财富”，“中国核试验的成功是全世界被压迫人民的成功和胜利”。
    评论说，“强大的中国，是世界爱好自由人民的最可靠的靠山。我们深深认识到，在拥有核武器的国家中，只有中华人民共和国是真正保卫世界和平的。”因此，中国第三次核试验成功，“给正在反对美帝国主义侵略的世界各国人民以巨大鼓舞”。
    老挝《青年报》十四日发表社论说：“中国成功地进行含有热核材料的核爆炸，使全世界爱好和平的人民特别是三百万老挝人民感到无比欢欣鼓舞，使美帝国主义及其仆从害怕得发抖，因为这是保卫世界和平的核武器，它彻底粉碎了美帝国主义的核垄断。”
    社论说，这一成就“证明了以毛泽东为首的中国共产党的路线是非常正确的和英明的，并反映了中国人民获得解放以后，中国在各方面都非常强大。”
    《青年报》的社论说，“这次中国核试验的成功，更加增强了亚非拉各国人民特别是印度支那人民反对美帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的决心。”
