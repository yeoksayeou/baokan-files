    Rely on Mao Zedong Thought to Vanquish All Enemies
    We are Always Ready to Annihilate Any Enemy Who Dares to Invade. At the Same Time, We Must Take Up Our Pens to Thoroughly Destroy the "Three-Family Village" Black Inn and Sweep Away All Demons and Monsters
    Feng Quanmin, Air Force First-Class Merit Citation Holder, Flying Squadron Leader, Kunming Military Region

      Deng Tuo, the boss of the "Three-Family Village" black inn, viciously attacks our Party's leadership as suffering from "amnesia," "bragging," and being "untrustworthy," and arrogantly shouts that our Party should be "splattered with dog's blood," "struck" on the "head," and "rendered comatose." This is not the ravings of a madman; this is a counter-revolutionary struggle in coordination with American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries against us. As a pilot of the People's Air Force, I am determined to bravely join the battle and smash the enemy's frenzied attack.

    Our Party is a long-tested, glorious, great, and correct Party; Chairman Mao is the great standard-bearer of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have fought arduously, relying on millet and rifles to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and establish a new China; and then, following the direction pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao, have launched a vigorous socialist revolution and socialist construction, rapidly changing the backward face of our country, characterized by poverty and blankness. All ethnic groups are united as one, political consciousness is steadily improving, and the revolutionary spirit is greatly promoted. In the past, we could not manufacture warships and airplanes; now we can. In the past, we could not produce oil; now we are basically self-sufficient. In the past, we did not have atomic bombs; now we do...

    Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most supreme and living Marxism, and a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism and modern revisionism. Looking back, our powerful People's Air Force volunteered to participate in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea when it was first established. At that time, our pilots had only flown a few dozen hours and had not even flown aerobatics. Fighting the American Air Force, which was known as having "air superiority" in the world, we defeated American imperialism by relying on Mao Zedong Thought, this spiritual atomic bomb, and eliminated American double "ace" pilots who had flown several thousand hours. Now, we still rely on Mao Zedong Thought to painfully annihilate invading flying bandits, whether they come by day or by night, manned or unmanned, we must completely and cleanly annihilate them all. Are these all empty words? Now, our country has become a powerful fortress for the world's people against imperialism and revisionism. Our friends are all over the world. The people of the whole country infinitely trust the Party and Chairman Mao, infinitely love the Party and Chairman Mao, and cheer "Long live, long live, long live" from the bottom of their hearts; the people of the world also love our Party and Chairman Mao, saying that Chairman Mao is the teacher of the world proletariat, "Comrade Mao Zedong belongs to the entire progressive humanity," and wish him a long life. The vicious attacks of Deng Tuo and his ilk do no harm to the great glory of the Party and Chairman Mao; on the contrary, they expose that they themselves are the real sufferers of "amnesia," are "liars," and their fallacies should be thoroughly criticized, their deceptions thoroughly exposed, and they should be thoroughly overthrown.

    Defending socialism is the most important task for the people of the whole country at present, and the most important combat task for every revolutionary fighter. While we are always ready to annihilate enemy planes that dare to invade, we must also take up our pens to thoroughly destroy the "Three-Family Village" black inn and sweep away all demons and monsters such as Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha.

    靠毛泽东思想战胜一切敌人
    我们随时准备歼灭敢于来犯的敌人。同时，我们要拿起笔来，彻底摧毁“三家村”黑店，扫除一切牛鬼蛇神
    昆明部队空军一等功臣、飞行大队长　冯全民
      “三家村”黑店的老板邓拓，恶毒地攻击我们党的领导是“健忘症”患者，是“吹牛皮”，
  “不堪信任”，狂妄地叫喊要对我们党“狗血淋头”，“打击”“头部”，“使之休克”。这不是狂人呓语，这是在配合美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，向我们进行的一场反革命斗争。我是人民空军的一个飞行员，决心英勇地投入战斗，粉碎敌人的猖狂进攻。
    我们的党，是久经考验、光荣、伟大、正确的党；毛主席是当代马克思列宁主义的伟大旗手。我国人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，艰苦斗争，靠小米加步枪，打败了国民党反动派，建立了新中国；随即又按照党和毛主席指引的方向，展开了轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，迅速改变着我国一穷二白的落后面貌。各族人民团结得象一个人，政治觉悟步步提高，革命精神大大发扬。过去不能制造军舰飞机，现在能制造了；过去不能生产石油，现在能基本自给，过去没有原子弹，现在有了……。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是最高最活的马克思主义，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。回顾我们强大的人民空军在刚建立时，就志愿参加了伟大的抗美援朝战争。那时候，我们飞行员只飞了几十个小时，连特技都没有飞，与号称世界“空中优势”的美国空军作战，我们就是靠毛泽东思想这个精神原子弹打败了美帝国主义，消灭了曾飞过几千小时的美国空中双料“王牌”。现在，我们仍然依靠毛泽东思想痛歼入侵飞贼，不管它是白天来、晚上来，有人的、无人的，一概都要把它全部干净的歼灭，这些难道都是空话吗？现在，我国已经成为世界人民反帝反修的强大堡垒。我们的朋友遍天下。全国人民无限信赖党和毛主席，无比热爱党和毛主席，打内心里欢呼“万岁万万岁”；世界人民也都热爱我们党和毛主席，说毛主席是世界无产阶级革命导师，“毛泽东同志属于整个进步人类”，祝愿他万寿无疆。邓拓之流的恶毒攻击，丝毫无损于党和毛主席的伟大光辉；相反，恰恰暴露他们自己才是真正的“健忘症”患者，是“骗子”，应当彻底批判他们的谬论，彻底揭穿他们的骗术，彻底打倒他们。
    保卫社会主义，是全国人民当前的头等大事，是每一个革命战士的头等战斗任务。我们要在随时准备歼灭敢于来犯的敌机的同时，又要拿起笔来，彻底摧毁“三家村”黑店，扫荡邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等一切牛鬼蛇神。
