    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 14th.  Yaffe Griba, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the 13th on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party, warmly congratulating China on the success of its third nuclear test.  The text of the telegram is as follows:
    At the time of this new and great success of China's third nuclear test, the Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party extends its warm congratulations to the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, scientific and technical personnel, and workers have mastered and applied Marxism-Leninism and the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, which guarantees this success. This success is a brilliant victory and a new example of the Chinese people's self-reliance and great leap forward in all aspects.
    These victories are also our victories, and the victories of the people of all countries around the world.
    The clamor of the American imperialists and their lackeys, as well as the revisionists who cooperate with them, shows that China's third nuclear test has given them a new and heavy blow.
    The refusal of the American imperialists and their collaborators, the Soviet revisionists, to accept the concrete proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China to convene a summit conference of all countries to discuss the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons has once again exposed their true colors.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China solemnly declares that China will never, at any time or under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons.
    American imperialism's refusal to make the same guarantee has once again exposed its true colors.
    American imperialism is still continuing to manufacture large quantities of various nuclear weapons, intensifying the establishment of its own nuclear bases all over the world, especially around China, and deploying nuclear weapons delivery vehicles in the air, on the sea, and in the sea. American imperialism, in cooperation with the Soviet revisionists, is still increasingly frantically engaging in nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against the people of all countries around the world.
    Just as American imperialism is spreading its nuclear weapons all over the world, the Soviet revisionist leading group is attempting to work with it on a "prevention of nuclear proliferation" treaty, attempting to impose their nuclear monopoly on others, and further intensifying nuclear blackmail in order to jointly prepare for aggression against the people of countries who oppose their blackmail and refuse to succumb to their threats.
    The correct and principled stand of the Communist Party, Government and people of China is a huge support for the people and countries of all countries who are making efforts together with them, persisting in the struggle to prevent nuclear war, to achieve the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and to strive for world peace.
    China's new nuclear test shows that the strength to defend the security of the People's Republic of China and all socialist countries has been strengthened in all aspects.
    Superstition in nuclear weapons is the core of the "ideology" and practice of the Khrushchev revisionists, and it is the core of their attempt to realize comprehensive cooperation with American imperialism in the US-Soviet domination of the world.
    However, nuclear weapons, like other weapons, cannot save American imperialism and its lackeys and the Khrushchev collaborators with the Soviet modern revisionist leading group as the core.
    In short, China's nuclear test shows that nuclear weapons, like other weapons, cannot be monopolized, and on the other hand, it also punctures the myth on which the nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats of the imperialists and their collaborators, the Khrushchev revisionists, are based.
    The correct policy of the Communist Party of China and the victory of the People's Republic of China are a great inspiration to the people of the world who are struggling for their own liberation.

    格里巴同志代表比共政治局热烈祝贺我核试验成功
    中国核爆炸是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利
    各国人民争取解放斗争获得巨大支援
    新华社布鲁塞尔十四日电 比利时共产党中央委员会书记雅夫·格里巴十三日代表比利时共产党政治局打电报给中国共产党中央委员会，热烈祝贺中国第三次核试验成功。电文如下：
    在中国获得第三次核试验这一新的和伟大的成功的时候，比利时共产党政治局向中国共产党和中国人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    中国人民解放军、科学技术人员和职工掌握和运用了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东同志的思想，这就保证了这一成功，这次成功是中国人民自力更生、在各方面实现大跃进的光辉胜利的新例证。
    这些胜利也是我们的胜利，也是全世界各国人民的胜利。
    美帝国主义者及其走狗以及同他们合作的修正主义者的叫嚣表明，中国的第三次核试验给了他们以新的沉重的打击。
    美帝国主义及其合作者苏联修正主义者拒绝中华人民共和国政府提出的关于召开世界各国首脑会议来讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的具体建议，这就再一次暴露了他们的面目。
    中华人民共和国政府郑重宣布，中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器。
    美帝国主义拒绝作出同样的保证，就又一次暴露了自己的面目。
    美帝国主义仍然在继续大量制造各种核武器，在全世界，特别是在中国周围，加紧建立自己的核基地，并且在空中、在海面和海里布置了核武器的运载工具。美帝国主义同苏联修正主义者进行合作，仍然日益疯狂地对全世界各国人民进行核讹诈和核威胁。
    正当美帝国主义在全世界扩散它的核武器的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团企图同它一起搞一个“防止核扩散”条约，妄图把它们的核垄断强加于人，并且进一步加紧进行核讹诈，以便共同准备对反对它们的讹诈和拒绝屈服于它们的威胁的各国人民进行侵略。
    中国共产党、政府和人民的正确的、有原则的立场，是对同他们一起作出努力、坚持为防止核战争、为实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器、为争取世界和平而斗争的各国人民和各个国家的巨大支援。
    中国的这次新的核试验，说明已经在各方面加强了保卫中华人民共和国和所有社会主义国家的安全的实力。
    迷信核武器是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的“意识形态”和实践的核心，是他们妄图实现在美国的霸权下的美苏主宰世界而同美帝国主义实行全面合作这一作法的核心。
    但是，核武器和其他武器一样，都挽救不了美帝国主义及其走狗和以苏联现代修正主义领导集团为核心的赫鲁晓夫合作者。
    总之，中国的核试验表明了核武器同其他武器一样，都不能垄断起来，另一方面，它还戳穿了帝国主义者及其合作者赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的核讹诈和核威胁所赖以建立的神话。
    中国共产党的正确政策和中华人民共和国的胜利，对为争取自己的解放而进行斗争的世界各国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。
