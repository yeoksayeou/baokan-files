    Representatives of leadership cadres at the regimental level and above from the Chengdu Military Region who participated in the Southwest Region County-Level and Above Leadership Cadres' Meeting of Active Participants in Studying Chairman Mao's Works held a forum on the 9th to severely criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities of the Deng Tuo black gang.

            Protecting Socialism is Our Sacred Duty

    Zhang Shixin (Deputy Political Commissar of a certain division): After reading the materials of Deng Tuo and his gang, such as "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three-Family Village Notes," their anti-Party and anti-socialist faces have been completely exposed. The spearhead of their attacks is directed at our Party and at Mao Zedong Thought. During the period of 1961 and 1962, precisely when imperialism and revisionism internationally were jointly opposing China, and domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements were emerging, Deng Tuo and his gang broke through the door, colluded internally and externally, viciously attacked our Party, opposed the general line of socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward, advocated and spoke unjustly for right-leaning opportunists who had been removed from office, and encouraged them to make a comeback. This is by no means a mere coincidence. Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary; whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." Deng Tuo is precisely a counter-revolutionary, and a ringleader of counter-revolutionaries. The "Three-Family Village" counter-revolutionary group was where Deng Tuo analyzed the situation, plotted strategies, disseminated experiences, issued orders, and commanded battles. The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have eyes like mirrors that expose demons. No matter how cunning, how hidden, or how adept at disguise these monsters and demons are, they will be exposed by the light of Mao Zedong Thought. Our People's Liberation Army has boundless love for the Party and unwavering faith in Mao Zedong Thought. Protecting the Party, protecting Mao Zedong Thought, and protecting socialist construction is the sacred duty of our People's Liberation Army. Whoever opposes the Party, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, or opposes socialism is our enemy. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang's eight million troops. Are we afraid of this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements? We can defeat enemies with guns and enemies with pens. We will fight them in writing and with force, and we will resolutely fight this great socialist cultural revolution to the end, and we will not withdraw until we achieve complete victory.

        We Firmly Believe in the Party and in Mao Zedong Thought

    Hou Shengde (Tibetan, Regimental Commander of a certain unit): "Three-Family Village Notes" and "Yanshan Night Talks" prove that Deng Tuo and his gang are determined to be enemies of the people and have an anti-Party and anti-socialist stance. The fact that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is an ironclad truth. Why did Deng Tuo attack this as "grand empty talk"? It is because they saw that the reactionary ruling classes of the world were heading towards death day by day, the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought was being grasped by more and more revolutionary masses, and the new communist spirit was growing day by day in our country. Therefore, they adopted the tactics of insinuation and veiled attacks to incite anti-Party sentiments, ignite the flames of capitalist restoration, cheer for the enemy, and pour cold water on the revolutionary people. Their purpose in inciting this is only one: to overthrow the leadership of the Party, allow the old system to rule the people again, and make the people listen to them. Isn't this set of theirs acting as a vanguard for imperialism and revisionism? Today's era is an era in which Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly, and the awakening of the people is higher than ever before. We firmly believe in the Party and firmly believe in Mao Zedong Thought. We know who we should love and who we should hate. Their anti-Party and anti-socialist goals will never be achieved.

          The Revolutionary Cause Cannot Be Opposed by Any Enemy

    Zhai Bingyue (Political Commissar of a certain artillery regiment): The more I read the anti-Party and anti-socialist materials of Deng Tuo and his gang, the more angry I become. I am particularly angry that they dare to slander our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao. Our Party is the greatest, most glorious, and most correct party of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the world's revolutionary people. Our revolutionary cause has grown from nothing to something, from small to large, and has continuously developed and grown stronger under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Today, some people dare to slander our great leader Chairman Mao, and we resolutely will not allow it. In the past, under the leadership of the great Party and Chairman Mao, we relied on guns to defeat the domestic and foreign reactionaries. Today, we must not only pick up guns but also pick up pens, and under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will repel the attacks of Deng Tuo and these anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. We will never allow Deng Tuo and these anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to stain the proletarian cultural front, and we must raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high on the cultural battlefront. China's socialist construction is developing rapidly, and every achievement in construction makes people happy, but Deng Tuo and his ilk are unhappy and oppose our Great Leap Forward. Chairman Mao said that it is not a bad thing for the enemy to oppose us. The more the enemy opposes us, the more it shows that we have achievements. The greater the enemy's opposition, the greater our achievements. The more special the enemy's opposition, the more special our achievements. The socialist cause, which represents the interests of 650 million people, cannot be opposed by any enemy! As long as there are poisonous weeds, we will pull them out; if we can't pull them out, we will dig them up. In the past, right-leaning opportunists opposed us and failed; now Deng Tuo and this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are opposing us, and they are also destined to fail.

          We Must Take Back the Cultural Front

    Yang Fengqi (Political Commissar of Leibo County Armed Forces Department): Deng Tuo released "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three-Family Village Notes" for the purpose of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. This is not surprising. Chairman Mao taught us long ago: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight us to the death." Deng Tuo is a class enemy hidden within us, and a very cunning and vicious enemy. Seeing that things were not going well, he wanted to take flight as the best option of the thirty-six stratagems, waiting for an opportunity to make a comeback. We tell Deng Tuo that your conspiracy will not succeed, and you cannot escape even if you want to. You must understand that the Chinese people and the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have clear minds and bright eyes. If you run to Yanshan at night to speak black words, we can pull you out; if you run to "Three-Family Village" to open a black shop, we can also catch you. Although we have not studied much ancient history, we have Mao Zedong Thought. We have laid a dragnet. No matter the big boss, the second boss, or the shop assistants in "Three-Family Village," we will catch them all together. Deng Tuo and this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are nothing great. They will be completely defeated by us, just like the reactionary forces in history, both Chinese and foreign. We must treat them with the same fighting attitude we used to eliminate all domestic and foreign reactionaries. Deng Tuo released a lot of poisonous weeds. He releases as much as he wants, and we will pull out as much as we want, and use them to fertilize the fields. We must take back the position on the cultural front, we must take all of them as prisoners, we will never stop until they are completely eliminated.

        Actively Join the Struggle and Open Fire on All Monsters and Demons

    Ma Yunpeng (Section Chief of the Direct Work Section of a certain unit): The great revolution on the cultural front is a matter of paramount importance concerning the destiny of our Party and our country. As a member of the People's Liberation Army, I must actively join the battle and wage war against those monsters and demons. The black gang group headed by Deng Tuo has always slandered the revolutionary cause of our Party, our army, and our people, and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. They infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, seized important positions, appeared as "experts" and "scholars," hung up a sheep's head and sold dog meat, waved a "red flag" to oppose the red flag, seized the opportunity to spread poison, opposed the Party, and opposed socialism. Now, we must seize power from them and make them surrender their weapons! Around 1961, Deng Tuo cooperated with domestic and foreign enemies to attack us. He led his black gang group, brought out emperors, generals, and ministers who had been abandoned by the people hundreds of years ago, attacked the Party and Chairman Mao with insinuations, spoke unjustly for the right-leaning opportunists who had been dismissed from office, cleared the way for capitalist restoration, and attempted to make the vast number of working people slaves again. It is not difficult to see that Deng Tuo and his ilk are virtuous grandsons of feudal emperors, filial sons of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and accomplices of imperialism and revisionism. Criticizing them and fighting them is not just a matter of writing articles, but of defending the victorious fruits of our country's revolution, carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, and defending the great Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Tuo and his ilk, listen up, no matter how well you disguise yourselves, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought can distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. You gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements will be crushed to pieces by the wheels of history.

    成都部队学习毛主席著作积极分子座谈表示
    彻底打垮“三家村”黑帮的猖狂进攻把毛泽东思想红旗插遍文化阵地
    中国人民解放军成都部队参加西南区县以上领导干部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的团以上领导干部代表，于九日举行座谈，严厉批判邓拓黑帮反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。
            保卫社会主义是我们的天职
    张示心（某师副政委）：看了邓拓一伙《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》等材料，他们的反党反社会主义面目已经昭然若揭。他们攻击的矛头都是针对着我们的党，针对着毛泽东思想的。一九六一年和一九六二年期间，正当国际上帝国主义、修正主义联合反华，国内地富反坏纷纷出笼的时候，邓拓等破门而出，里应外合，恶毒地攻击我们的党，反对社会主义建设总路线、大跃进，为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，鼓励他们东山再起，这决不是偶然的巧合。毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”邓拓正是个反革命派，而且是个反革命派的头目。“三家村”这个反革命集团，是邓拓在那里分析形势，出谋划策，传播经验，发号施令，指挥战斗。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，每双眼睛都是一副照妖镜。不管这些牛鬼蛇神多么狡猾，多么隐蔽，多么善于伪装，用毛泽东思想一照就照出来了。我们解放军对党无比热爱，对毛泽东思想坚信不移。保卫党、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫社会主义建设，是我们解放军的天职。谁反对党、反对毛泽东思想、反对社会主义，谁就是我们的敌人。我们在毛主席的领导下，打垮了日本帝国主义，打垮了国民党八百万军队，难道还怕这一小撮反党反社会主义分子吗？我们能够战胜拿枪的敌人，也能够战胜拿笔的敌人，文来文打，武来武打，要坚决把这场社会主义文化大革命的仗打到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
        我们坚定地相信党、相信毛泽东思想
    侯生德（藏族、某部团长）：《三家村札记》和《燕山夜话》，证明了邓拓一伙死心塌地与人民为敌的反党反社会主义立场。“东风压倒西风”是铁的事实，邓拓为什么要攻击这是“伟大的空话”？这是因为他们看到世界上的反动统治阶级正一天天走向死亡，毛泽东思想的武器正一天天被更多的革命群众所掌握，共产主义新风正在我国一天天的增长，于是他们采取含沙射影、指桑骂槐等手法，煽反党分子之风，点资本主义复辟之火，给敌人打气，给革命人民泼冷水。他们这样煽动的目的只有一个：推翻党的领导，让旧制度重新统治人民，让人民听他们的话。他们这一套，不就是为帝国主义、修正主义充当马前卒吗？今天的时代，是毛泽东思想大放光芒的时代，是人民觉悟空前高涨的时代。我们坚定地相信党，坚定地相信毛泽东思想。我们懂得应该爱谁，应该恨谁。他们反党反社会主义的目的是永远达不到的。
          革命事业是任何敌人反对不了的
    翟秉钺（某炮兵团政委）：越看邓拓一伙反党反社会主义的材料，心里越气愤。特别气愤的是，他们敢于诬蔑我们伟大的党，伟大的领袖毛主席。我们的党是当代最伟大、光荣、正确的党，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。毛主席不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且还是世界革命人民的领袖。我国的革命事业，就是在毛主席的领导下，从无到有，从小到大，不断发展壮大起来的。今天，竟有人胆敢诬蔑我们的伟大领袖毛主席，我们坚决不答应。过去我们在伟大的党和毛主席的领导下依靠枪杆子打败了国内外的反动派。今天，我们不仅要拿起枪杆子，而且要拿起笔杆子，在党和毛主席的领导下，打退邓拓这些反党反社会主义分子的进攻。我们决不容许邓拓这些反党反社会主义的分子沾污无产阶级的文化阵地，我们一定要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高高地插在文化战线的阵地上。我国社会主义的建设事业飞快地向前发展，每一项建设成就都使人高兴，但是邓拓之流却不高兴，反对我们大跃进。毛主席说，敌人反对我们并不是坏事。敌人越反对我们，就越说明我们有成绩，敌人大反，我们的成绩就更大，敌人特反，我们的成绩就特大。代表六亿五千万人民利益的社会主义事业，是任何敌人也反对不了的！只要有毒草，我们就拔；拔不掉，就挖。以前，右倾机会主义分子反对我们，失败了；现在邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义分子反对我们，也注定要失败。
          我们一定要把文化阵地夺回来
    杨凤歧（雷波县武装部政委）：邓拓放出《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》的目的，就是反党反社会主义。这并不奇怪。毛主席早就教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争”。邓拓就是暗藏在我们内部的阶级敌人，而且是个很狡猾、很恶毒的敌人。他见事不好，就想三十六计走为上计，等待时机东山再起。我们告诉邓拓，你们的阴谋是不能得逞的，想跑也跑不掉。你要明白，我国人民和中国人民解放军的指战员，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，有清醒的头脑，明亮的眼睛。你晚上跑到燕山说黑话，我们能揪出你；跑到“三家村”开黑店，我们也能抓到你。我们虽然没有研究过多少古代历史，但有着毛泽东思想。我们布下了天罗地网，不论“三家村”里的大掌柜、二掌柜或伙计，我们一起来抓。邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子没有什么了不起，他们将和历史上的中外反动派一样，彻底被我们打败。我们要用过去消灭国内外一切反动派的战斗姿态，来对待他们。邓拓放出了很多毒草，他放多少，我们就拔多少，拔了用来肥田。我们一定要把文化战线的阵地夺回来，要他们统统作俘虏，不彻底消灭，绝不罢休。
        积极投入斗争，向一切牛鬼蛇神开火
    马云鹏（某部直工科科长）：文化战线的大革命，是关系着我们党和国家命运的头等大事。我作为人民解放军的一个成员，要积极投入战斗，向那些牛鬼蛇神开战。以邓拓为首的黑帮集团，一直诋毁我党我军和我国人民的革命事业，反对毛泽东思想。他们混进了革命阵营，窃取要职，以“专家”、“学者”的身份出现，挂羊头，卖狗肉，打着“红旗”反红旗，伺机放毒，反党反社会主义。现在，我们要向他们夺权，要他们缴械！在一九六一年前后，邓拓配合国内外敌人向我们进攻。他率领着他的黑帮集团，抬出几百年前被人民唾弃的帝王将相，含沙射影地攻击党和毛主席，替罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道，企图让广大劳动人民重新当牛马、做奴隶。这不难看出，邓拓之流是封建帝王的贤孙，地富反坏的孝子，帝国主义、修正主义的帮凶。批判他们，斗争他们，绝不是打笔墨官司，是保卫我国革命的胜利果实，是把社会主义革命进行到底，是捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想。邓拓之流，你们听着，任凭你们伪装得再好，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众和革命干部，是分辨得出什么是香花，什么是毒草的，你们这伙反党反社会主义分子，将被历史的巨轮碾得粉身碎骨。
