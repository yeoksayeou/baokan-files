    The success of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is multifaceted. Whether it's the adaptation of the script, the choreography, the musical composition, the handling of characters, or the stage art, there are new creations that are inspiring to see. The comrades of the Shanghai Dance School have created a wealth of experience, and there are many things worth learning from them. Here, I would like to focus on the music.
    Classical ballet has always served the foreign bourgeoisie and has a set of solidified forms of expression. For example, solo dances and pas de deux have a set of old formulas for expressing love, death, etc. This kind of formula is fundamentally unable to express revolutionary content. Therefore, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School first started from revolutionary content and from the characters to create, and then reformed, combined with traditional folk dances and opera movements, and successfully applied them. In order to allow the ballet to better express content and reveal the thoughts and feelings of the characters in the play, they broke with conventions and added solo and chorus accompaniment, which greatly enriched the expressive power of the ballet. In short, with high political enthusiasm, they tried every means to use the foreign form of ballet for our own purposes. Therefore, they have mastered the initiative in "making foreign things serve China" and set an example for us.
    The ballet also highlights class struggle in music. All the lyrics and the entire tone make people feel full of class feelings. The main arias of the opera "The White-Haired Girl" are certainly very beautiful and moving, but after all, it still has dramatic dialogue. In the ballet "The White-Haired Girl", in order to reveal the spirit of resistance of Xi'er, Yang Bailao and others, there have been developments and creations on the basis of the original music. For example, the music "The North Wind Blows", which is the theme music of Xi'er, is performed many times in the play. In the first scene, when Xi'er and others wait for their father to return home for the New Year, the music makes people feel Xi'er's innocence and simplicity. In the second scene, when Xi'er is severely beaten by the landlord's wife, it makes people feel that she has a rebellious character. At the end of the third scene, when Xi'er escapes to the reed pond, the accompaniment "I will not die, I want to live, I want revenge" is added, and at the end, a brief and powerful chorus is added, which just speaks out what thousands of Xi'ers in the old society wanted to say. Our musical theme is revolutionary and inspiring. Another success in the musical creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is the ruthless destruction of foreign dogmas and foreign frameworks. When some of our composers use Western orchestras, they often do not consider our own nation's appreciation habits, and immediately emphasize so-called texture, symphony, etc. Often, a melody that was originally relatively pleasant is buried by forcibly adding some texture and symphony. The music of "The White-Haired Girl" is completely different. Its melody is very prominent and very clear. The musical composition of "The White-Haired Girl" inherits our national tradition and has a very obvious national style. In addition, the author's successful addition of several national musical instruments to the orchestra is also very good. For example, the music when Yang Bailao dies in the first scene adds a banhu, which makes people feel more sad and angry. This use cannot be replaced by any foreign instrument. The music of the entire ballet has a clear national style and national color, and is closely integrated with the content of the drama and the characters on stage. In addition, the passionate and delicate performance of the orchestra and accompaniment makes the entire ballet produce a strong artistic appeal.

    芭蕾艺术的新突破
    黎国荃
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的成就是多方面的，不论剧本改编、舞蹈编导，还是音乐创作、人物处理以及舞台美术等方面，都有新的创造，看了之后，令人振奋。上海舞蹈学校的同志们创造了丰富的经验，有许多值得我们学习的地方，这里只想着重谈谈其中的音乐。
    古典芭蕾舞一直为外国资产阶级服务，有一套凝固的表现形式，如独舞、双人舞都有一套旧的程式，表现爱情、死等。这种程式，根本无法表现革命内容，因此上海舞蹈学校的师生，首先从革命内容、从人物出发进行创造，然后再来改革，并结合传统的民族舞蹈和戏曲动作，成功的加以运用。为了让芭蕾舞剧更好地表达内容，揭示剧中人物的思想感情，他们打破了陈规旧套，加了独唱、合唱等伴唱，大大丰富了芭蕾舞的表现力，总之，他们怀着高度的政治热情，千方百计地使芭蕾舞这一外来形式为我所用，因此，在外为中用上掌握了主动权，并为我们树立了榜样。
    舞剧在音乐方面也突出了阶级斗争，所有唱词和整个音调使人感觉满怀阶级感情。歌剧《白毛女》的主要唱段，固然十分优美动听，但它毕竟还有戏剧台词，而芭蕾舞《白毛女》中，为了揭示喜儿、杨白劳等人的反抗精神，又在原来的音乐基础上，有了发展和创造。比如，作为喜儿的主题音乐《北风吹》这段音乐，在剧中多次表现。第一场喜儿等爹回家过年时，音乐使人感到喜儿的纯真、朴实；第二场喜儿遭到地主婆毒打，就让人感觉具有反抗性格了。第三场结尾，当喜儿逃到芦苇塘边，这时伴唱“我不死，我要活，我要报仇”这段音乐，结尾时又加上一句简短有力的合唱，正好说出了旧社会中千千万万个喜儿要说的话。我们的音乐主题是革命的、令人振奋的，舞剧《白毛女》在音乐创作上另一个成功之处，就是狠破洋教条、洋框框。我们有些作曲家运用西洋乐队时，往往不考虑我们自己民族的欣赏习惯，一来就强调所谓织体、交响性等等，常常一个原来还比较好听的旋律，由于硬加上一些织体和交响性这些东西，好听的曲调就被埋没了。《白毛女》的音乐就完全不同，它的曲调非常突出，非常鲜明。《白毛女》的音乐作曲，继承了我们民族的传统，具有极明显的民族风格。此外，作者在管弦乐中成功地加进了若干民族乐器，也是很好的。如第一场杨白劳死时的音乐，加进了板胡，听了使人增加了悲愤心情，这样运用，是任何外国乐器所代替不了的。整个芭蕾舞剧的音乐，具有明显的民族风格和民族色彩，与戏剧内容和舞台人物结合十分紧密，加上乐队演奏和伴唱的激情，细腻，使整个舞剧产生了强大的艺术感染力量。
