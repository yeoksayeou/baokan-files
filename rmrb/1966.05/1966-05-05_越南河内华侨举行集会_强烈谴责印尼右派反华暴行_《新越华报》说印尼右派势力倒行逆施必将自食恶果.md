　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 3rd - Overseas Chinese from all walks of life in Hanoi held a rally on the evening of April 28th, strongly protesting and condemning the rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese actions of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces and their continuous fascist atrocities of attacking the Chinese representative offices in Indonesia.
　　Zhuang Yong, Acting Director of the Vietnam Overseas Chinese Federation, said in his speech that the anti-China atrocities of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique are rare fascist bandit acts in the history of international relations. These anti-China fascist atrocities were obviously carried out under the direct organization and command of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary regime. The Indonesian right-wing military regime must bear full responsibility for deteriorating the relations between China and Indonesia.
　　He said that the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam strongly protest the anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people atrocities of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique, fully support the position clarified in the note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Embassy in China, and firmly support the struggle of the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests.
　　The rally also passed a resolution strongly protesting and condemning the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese activities and their wanton massacre of Indonesian communists and patriotic progressive people.
　　The Hanoi "Xin Yue Hua Bao" published an editorial on April 29th, strongly condemning the increasingly rampant anti-China fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
　　The editorial pointed out that the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique is so hateful of China because China adheres to revolution, resolutely wages a tit-for-tat struggle against US imperialism and its lackeys, and resolutely supports the struggle of the Indonesian people and the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries against imperialism and colonialism. The more frenzied the anti-China acts of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique, the more thoroughly exposed their anti-communist, anti-people, counter-revolutionary faces and their willingness to serve as accomplices of US imperialism.
　　The editorial said that the Chinese people are advancing, and the world people's revolution is developing. This is the trend of history, and no reactionary force can stop it. The Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique's regression can only lead to their own destruction.

    越南河内华侨举行集会
    强烈谴责印尼右派反华暴行
    《新越华报》说印尼右派势力倒行逆施必将自食恶果
    新华社河内三日电　河内市各界华侨四月二十八日晚上举行集会，强烈抗议和谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力猖狂反华排华和不断袭击中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构的法西斯暴行。
    越南华侨联合总会代主任庄庸在会上讲话指出，印度尼西亚亲美反动集团的反华暴行，是国际关系史上罕见的法西斯强盗行为。这些反华法西斯暴行显然是在印度尼西亚亲美反动政权直接组织和指挥下干出来的，印度尼西亚右派军人政权要对恶化中国和印度尼西亚两国的关系承担全部责任。
    他说，越南华侨强烈抗议印度尼西亚亲美反动集团反共、反华、反人民的暴行，完全支持中国外交部给印度尼西亚驻华大使馆的照会中所阐明的立场，坚决支持印度尼西亚华侨为维护自己的正当权益而进行的斗争。
    集会还通过了一项决议，强烈抗议和谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂反华、排华和肆意屠杀印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国进步人士的法西斯暴行。
    河内《新越华报》四月二十九日发表社论，强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力日益猖狂的反华法西斯暴行。
    社论指出，印度尼西亚亲美反动集团如此仇恨中国，是因为中国坚持革命，坚决同美帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对的斗争，坚决支持印度尼西亚人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。印度尼西亚亲美反动集团的反华行径越疯狂，他们的反共、反人民、反革命和甘心充当美帝国主义的帮凶的嘴脸就越暴露得彻底。
    社论说，中国人民是要前进的，世界人民革命是要发展的，这是历史潮流，任何反动势力也阻挡不了。印度尼西亚亲美反动集团倒行逆施，只能自食恶果。
