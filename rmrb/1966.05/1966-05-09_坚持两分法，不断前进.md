    Adhere to the Two-Point Methodology, Advance Continuously
    Our factory has been learning from Daqing for over two years.  In the process of these two years of learning, we've realized that to truly master the Daqing experience, we must first resolve the ideological problems of the leading cadres, meaning the leadership team must first become revolutionized.

    At the beginning of our study, there was considerable ideological resistance among our leading cadres. Some emphasized special conditions, refusing to acknowledge the universality of the Daqing experience. Others lacked ambition and believed the Daqing standards were too high, making them afraid to learn. Some were arrogant, complacent, and self-enclosed, claiming they had their own methods. Under the influence of these thoughts, learning from Daqing took some detours, focusing only on forms and methods, even becoming rigid.

    While there are many good practices in the Daqing experience that we should learn, the most important is the revolutionization of the leadership team. Only with a revolutionized leadership can we bring forth a revolutionized team. In the second half of last year, to address the ideological problems of the leading cadres, we organized the study of Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, examined and criticized complacency, and moved the Party Committee meeting to Daqing to learn and observe while identifying our shortcomings. The effect was very good. Through comparison, we found the real gaps. Those comrades who previously had been complacent and self-satisfied were now convinced. They said: "We came with the idea of being almost as good, but we are leaving with the understanding that we are far behind." Everyone unanimously expressed that they would use the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people to run a Daqing-style enterprise.

    Learning from Daqing and building Daqing-style enterprises is a profound revolution. Only by adhering to the two-point methodology can we continuously revolutionize and continuously advance. This is an extremely important aspect of the Daqing leadership experience. How to adhere to the two-point methodology? We feel that the most important thing is to correctly handle the relationship between achievements and shortcomings, ambition and humility. Affirming achievements can strengthen revolutionary determination; vigorously identifying shortcomings can promote continuous revolution. Having ambition enables foresight; humbly learning from the advanced enables us to advance to higher standards. In the process of learning from Daqing and carrying out enterprise revolutionization over the past two years, our factory has experienced two periods of stagnation. Both times, it was because some cadres developed blind arrogance and complacency after achieving certain successes. Later, we adopted the following approach: Whenever the revolution progressed for a period, we would use the two-point methodology to carry out a mass inspection and summary, comparing ourselves with Daqing and other advanced enterprises to identify our gaps. Each mass inspection and summary is a mass-based practice of creatively applying the two-point methodology, an expression of democratic style in enterprise management, and the implementation of the mass line. It powerfully stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers and also served as a rectification campaign for the cadres, playing an important role in promoting the revolution of leadership thinking, leadership methods, and leadership style.

    坚持两分法，不断前进
    我们厂学习大庆已经两年多了。在两年多的学习过程中，我们的体会是，要把大庆经验真正学到手，首先要解决领导干部的思想问题，也就是领导班子首先要革命化。
    在开始学习的时候，在我们领导干部中间，有不少思想阻力，有人强调条件特殊，不承认大庆经验的普遍性；有人缺乏雄心壮志，认为大庆标准太高，不敢学；有人骄傲自满，故步自封，自称有一套。在这些思想支配下，学大庆曾经走了一些弯路，只学了些形式、方法，甚至走了“板”。
    大庆经验中有许多好的做法固然要学，但是最主要的一条，就是领导班子的革命化，有了革命化的领导，才带出了革命化的队伍。去年下半年，我们为了解决领导干部的思想问题，就组织起来学习了毛主席的有关指示，检查和批判了骄傲自满思想，并把党委会搬到大庆去开，边学边看，边找差距，效果很好。我们在对比之下，找到了真正的差距，原来有骄傲自满情绪、自称有一套的同志心服口服了，他们说：“我们是带着差不多的思想来，带着差得多的思想回去。”大家一致表示，要以大庆人的革命精神办大庆式的企业。
    学大庆，办大庆式企业，是一场深刻的革命，只有坚持两分法，才能不断革命，不断前进。这是大庆领导经验中极为重要的一条。如何坚持两分法呢？我们感到，最重要的是要正确处理成绩和缺点，雄心和虚心的关系。肯定了成绩，就能坚定革命决心；狠找缺点，就能促使不断革命。有了雄心，就能高瞻远瞩；虚心学习先进，就能向更高标准前进。我厂在两年多来学大庆开展企业革命化的过程中，曾经出现过两次停顿不前的状态，这两次都是由于在取得一定成绩以后，一部分干部产生了盲目的骄傲自满情绪。以后，我们就采取了这样的做法：每当革命进行一段，就运用两分法开展一次群众性大检查、大总结，和大庆以及其他先进企业对一次标，找一次差距。每一次大检查、大总结，就是一次群众性的活学活用两分法，就是企业管理上的民主作风的发扬，群众路线的贯彻，它有力地激发了职工的积极性，而且也是对干部的一次整风，对于促进领导思想、领导方法、领导作风革命，起了重要的作用。
