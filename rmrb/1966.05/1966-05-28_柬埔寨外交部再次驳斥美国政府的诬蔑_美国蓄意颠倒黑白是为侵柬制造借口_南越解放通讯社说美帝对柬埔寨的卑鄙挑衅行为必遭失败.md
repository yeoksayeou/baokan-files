    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 25th (Via Cambodian News Agency, May 25th) – The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has again refuted the U.S. government's allegation that the Viet Cong (Editor's note: referring to the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces) is using Cambodian territory, and pointed out that this is a pretext for the U.S. to openly carry out aggression and provocation against Cambodia.

    The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated this in a note in reply to the Australian Embassy in Cambodia. As Cambodia has severed diplomatic relations with the United States, the U.S. State Department recently made unreasonable accusations against the Cambodian government through the Australian Embassy, insisting that on April 30th, the "Viet Cong" fired on U.S. troops inside "South Vietnam" from Cambodian territory.

    The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that on April 30th, it was the armed forces of the U.S.-Saigon regime that fired on Cambodian territory. The Cambodian government had already protested to the U.S. on May 10th. The Cambodian government pointed out that it was Cambodian self-defense forces, not the Viet Cong, that retaliated against this act of aggression. The Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have never allowed foreign troops, regardless of which side they belong to, to cross the Cambodian border.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh – Cambodian National Radio broadcast a commentary on the evening of the 21st, solemnly refuting the U.S. government's attempt to reverse black and white, and characterize the invasion of Cambodia by the U.S. troops invading Vietnam as "hostile acts" against U.S. troops.

    The U.S. State Department, through the Australian Embassy in Cambodia, made this unreasonable accusation against the Cambodian government. The U.S. note absurdly claimed that incidents of firing on U.S. troops inside "South Vietnam" from Cambodian territory occurred on April 29th and 30th. The Cambodian National Radio commentary pointed out: This is a "despicable accusation against Cambodia, attempting to portray the victim as the aggressor. Such shameless distortion of the truth and deliberate lying infuriate us Cambodians."

    The commentary said: "To say that 'small' Cambodia – if we may borrow this insulting expression from Western journalists – would truly threaten the most powerful imperialist country is simply unbelievable. It is the Saigon troops, the U.S. troops, or the hirelings of the U.S. lackeys, namely the 'Free Khmer' mercenary troops, traitors to the fatherland, who have deliberately invaded our eastern border. Our territorial integrity is violated daily, innocent Cambodian farmers are massacred, while Washington claims that we are the aggressors – what sharp irony!"

    The commentary emphasized: "Our airspace is constantly violated, and therefore, as required by international norms, our anti-aircraft guns have had to fire on aircraft that violate our territory." In refuting the U.S. government's claim of Cambodia's "hostile acts," the commentary also said: "Should the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces sit idly by in the face of violations of our airspace? That would be outrageous, and also a disregard for our determination to maintain neutrality while resisting any aggressor and defending our territorial integrity."

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 25th – The South Vietnam Liberation News Agency recently published a commentary condemning the U.S. government's slanders against the Cambodian government and the provocative acts of U.S. aggressor troops in South Vietnam shelling Cambodian territory.

    The commentary pointed out that the U.S. government's recent note to the Cambodian government, accusing the Cambodian government of allowing the South Vietnamese Liberation Army to attack U.S. aggressors from Cambodian territory, is entirely a trick of a rogue. The fact is that, for a long time, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam and Thailand have incessantly launched armed provocations against the border of the Kingdom of Cambodia. U.S. imperialism also supports the so-called "Free Khmer" rebels, providing them with weapons and equipment, and inciting them to carry out various sabotage and subversive activities against Cambodia. U.S. imperialism thinks that by exerting this kind of military, economic and diplomatic pressure, it can make the government and people of the Kingdom of Cambodia yield. But they are greatly mistaken.

    The commentary said that the U.S. imperialism's slander against the Cambodian government aims to create a pretext for expanding the war of aggression to Cambodian territory. The South Vietnamese people, together with the Cambodian people, are determined to expose and smash this despicable conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists. No matter what despicable means the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys adopt, they are bound to meet with a shameful defeat.

    柬埔寨外交部再次驳斥美国政府的诬蔑
    美国蓄意颠倒黑白是为侵柬制造借口
    南越解放通讯社说美帝对柬埔寨的卑鄙挑衅行为必遭失败
    新华社金边二十五日电　据柬埔寨新闻社二十五日报道：柬埔寨王国外交部再次驳斥了美国政府提出的所谓越共（编者按：指南越人民武装力量）利用柬埔寨领土的说法，并且指出，这是美国用来明目张胆地向柬埔寨进行侵略和挑衅的借口。
    柬埔寨外交部是在答复澳大利亚驻柬埔寨大使馆的照会中这样说的。由于柬埔寨早已断绝了同美国的外交关系，美国国务院最近通过澳大利亚大使馆向柬埔寨政府提出无理指责，硬说在四月三十日，“越共”从柬埔寨领土上向“南越境内”的美军开火。
    柬埔寨外交部指出，在四月三十日，是美国—西贡政权的武装部队向柬埔寨领土开火的。柬埔寨政府在五月十日已经向美国提出过抗议。柬埔寨政府指出，对这种侵略行动进行反击的是柬埔寨的自卫部队，而不是越共。柬埔寨王家武装部队从来不准许不管属于哪一方面的外国军队通过柬埔寨的边境。
    新华社金边电　柬埔寨国家电台二十一日晚上发表评论，严正驳斥美国政府颠倒黑白，把侵越美军侵略柬埔寨的事件硬说成是对美军采取的“敌对行动”。
    美国国务院是通过澳大利亚驻柬埔寨使馆向柬埔寨政府提出这项无理指责的。美国的照会胡说什么在四月二十九日和三十日发生了从柬埔寨领土上向“南越境内”的美军开火的事件。柬埔寨国家电台的评论指出：这是对柬埔寨“卑鄙的指责，企图把受害者说成侵略者。这样无耻地歪曲真相和这样蓄意扯谎，使我们柬埔寨人十分气愤。”
    评论说：“要说‘小小的’柬埔寨——姑且借用西方记者的这种侮辱性的说法——会真正威胁这个最强大的帝国主义国家，这是无法叫人相信的。是西贡军队、美国军队或者是美国走狗的走狗，即祖国的叛徒‘自由高棉’雇佣军对我国东部边境进行了蓄意侵略。我国的领土完整每天都受到新的侵犯，柬埔寨的无辜农民被屠杀，而华盛顿却说我们是侵略者，这是多么尖锐的讽刺！”
    评论强调指出：“我国领空经常遭到侵犯，因此，正如国际准则所要求的那样，我国的高射炮不得不对侵犯我国领土的飞机进行射击。”在驳斥美国政府所谓柬埔寨的“敌对行动”的说法时，评论还说：“柬埔寨王家武装部队难道应当对侵犯我国领空的事件坐视不管吗？这太不象话了，这也是对我们保持中立同时抗击任何侵略者、保卫我国领土完整的决心的蔑视。”
    新华社河内二十五日电　越南南方解放通讯社最近发表评论，谴责美国政府对柬埔寨政府进行诬蔑和美国在南越的侵略军炮击柬埔寨领土的挑衅行为。
    评论指出，美国政府最近在给柬埔寨政府的一份照会中诬蔑柬埔寨政府让越南南方解放军从柬埔寨领土攻击美国侵略者，这完全是流氓恶棍之流所惯用的贼喊捉贼的伎俩。事实是，长期以来，美帝国主义及其在越南南方和泰国的走狗一直不停地向柬埔寨王国边境发动武装挑衅，美帝国主义还豢养所谓“自由高棉”叛乱分子，给他们提供武器和装备，唆使他们对柬埔寨进行各种破坏和颠覆活动。美帝国主义以为施加这种军事、经济和外交的压力，就可以使柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨人民屈服。可是他们是大错特错了。
    评论说，美帝国主义对柬埔寨政府进行诬蔑，其目的是为把侵略战争扩大到柬埔寨国土制造借口，越南南方人民同柬埔寨人民一道坚决揭露和粉碎美帝国主义者的这一卑鄙的阴谋。美帝国主义及其走狗无论采用怎样卑鄙的手段，都一定会遭到可耻的失败。
