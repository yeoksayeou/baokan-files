    Absolutely Not Allowed to Wu Han to Slander the New Society
    Dock Old Workers of the Tianjin Office of the Port Authority Wang Baoyin Cai Dianyou
    We are dock workers, formerly "big shoulder" laborers. We are very angry about Wu Han's crimes against the Party and socialism. This sharp class struggle was provoked by Wu Han. Our working class will absolutely not allow Wu Han to uglify our working people, and even more will not allow him to viciously slander our great Party and socialism. We must carry out a resolute counterattack. In the old society, the officials of the reactionary government served a minority of feudal bosses and exploiting classes. At that time, capitalists and feudal bosses simply didn't treat us like human beings, calling us "stinking riverbank haulers." We all came to the docks when we were teenagers. At that time, in order to survive, we worked for the capitalists from before dawn until after dark. The money we earned from a day's work wasn't enough to buy a full meal, and we suffered the oppression and exploitation of the police, constables, security teams, secret service teams, and big and small feudal bosses.
    The workers' labor lacked safety equipment and labor protection. Accidents with injuries and deaths happened almost every day. A worker named Shuang Ju fell from the deck of a ship into the hold, more than three zhang deep, while unloading cargo. The boss had people roll him away in a straw mat. Once, workers were carrying white flour down from a ship when suddenly the cable broke. Many workers carrying the flour fell into the river. The boss told the workers to quickly salvage the flour. The flour was all salvaged, but not many people came up.
    In the dark old society, dock workers had no political standing and no security for their lives. After liberation, it was the Party and Chairman Mao who rescued us poor dock workers from the man-eating old society. In the past, we were called stinking big shoulder laborers, but now we have become masters of the country. The Party and the state attach great importance to us, strengthened labor protection measures during work, and the port has also achieved mechanization. This is the brilliant leadership of the Party and the superiority of the socialist system. We have deep-seated class hatred for the evil old society, and we have boundless love for the new society, for the Party and Chairman Mao. Wu Han attempts to turn back the wheels of history, vainly trying to pull the old society back, is daydreaming! In order to defend the socialist state, our working class must wage a resolute struggle against Wu Han.

    决不允许吴晗诬蔑新社会
    港务局天津办事处码头老工人  王宝印  蔡殿友
    我们是码头工人，就是过去扛大个的。我们对吴晗反党反社会主义的罪行很生气。这一场尖锐的阶级斗争是吴晗挑起的。我们工人阶级决不许吴晗丑化我们劳动人民，更不许他恶毒地诬蔑我们伟大的党和社会主义，我们一定要进行坚决的反击。在旧社会，反动政府的官是为少数封建把头、剥削阶级服务的。那时候，资本家、封建把头根本不拿我们当人看，说我们是“臭扛河坝”的。我们都是十几岁就来到码头的。当时为了活命，顶星星来，顶星星去的给资本家干活。干一天活，拿的钱不够吃一顿饱饭，还受尽了警察、宪兵、保安队、特务队、大小封建把头的压迫剥削。
    工人的劳动没有安全设备，没有劳动保护，伤亡的事情几乎每天都有。一个叫双居的工人在卸船时，从船面上摔到三丈多深的船舱里，把头叫人用一张席子卷走了。有一次工人扛着白面，从船上往下走，突然缆绳断了，很多工人扛着面掉到了河里，把头叫工人赶快捞面，面都捞上来了，人却上来的不多。
    在黑暗的旧社会里，码头工人政治上没有地位，生命没有保障。解放了，是党和毛主席把我们穷苦的码头工人从吃人的旧社会里救了出来，过去我们被人称为臭扛大个的，现在成了国家的主人。党和国家对我们很重视，工作时加强了劳动保护措施，港口又实现了机械化。这就是党的英明领导，社会主义制度的优越性。我们对万恶的旧社会有着刻骨的阶级仇恨，对新社会，对党和毛主席有着无比的热爱。吴晗企图让历史的车轮倒转，妄想把旧社会拉回来，是白日做梦！为了保卫社会主义江山，我们工人阶级一定要和吴晗作坚决的斗争。
