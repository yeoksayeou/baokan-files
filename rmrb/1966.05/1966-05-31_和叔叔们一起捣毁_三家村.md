    Together with My Uncles, We Demolish the "Three-Family Village"
    By Liu Jinling, Young Pioneer of the West Elm Tree Brigade, Linshu County, Shandong

    The "Three-Family Village," this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist big bad guys, they are full of malicious intentions, wanting to drag us back to the old society. The people of the whole country can see it clearly, and we children can also see it clearly.

    I am thirteen years old this year and have not seen the old society. However, from the chairman of the poor peasant association in our brigade, from my grandparents, I know what the old society was like. Zhao Wenzhong, the chairman of the poor peasant association in our brigade, often tells us children about the suffering of the working people oppressed and exploited by landlords and rich peasants in the old society. My grandmother also often tells me about my family history. Comparing them, I think: The children of the new society are so happy, not worrying about food or clothing, studying and working, feeling happy all day long. Deng Tuo and his gang of bad guys, vainly trying to let landlords and capitalists ride on our heads again, making us like the older generation, working like beasts of burden, we will never agree!

    Deng Tuo, this big bad guy, also fabricated a poem written by a child to viciously curse Chairman Mao's saying that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is a "cliché," not allowing us children to write about the East Wind, West Wind, benefactors, or enemies. His purpose is not to let us listen to Chairman Mao's words. Let me tell you, Deng Tuo, we will always listen to Chairman Mao's words. Chairman Mao's words illuminate the hearts of every working person, and also illuminate the hearts of every child. We children, after reading Chairman Mao's books and learning Chairman Mao's quotations, have become red-hearted and bright-eyed, loving our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao even more, and recognizing more clearly who is the enemy, who is the friend, who is the good person, and who is the bad person.

    We must forever love the great Communist Party, love the great leader Chairman Mao, always listen to the Party's words, listen to Chairman Mao's words, study hard, make progress every day, be good children of Chairman Mao, be successors to the red revolution, and together with our uncles, overthrow Deng Tuo and his gang of bad guys!

### 和叔叔们一起捣毁“三家村”

    和叔叔们一起捣毁“三家村”
    山东临沭县西榆树大队少先队员　刘锦玲
    “三家村”这伙反党反社会主义的大坏蛋，他们一肚子坏心眼子，想把我们拉回旧社会去。全国人民看得清清楚楚，我们少年儿童也都看得一清二楚。
    我今年十三岁，没见过旧社会。可是，我从俺大队贫协主任那里，从我爷爷奶奶那里，知道旧社会是个什么滋味。俺大队贫协主任赵文忠常给俺少年儿童讲旧社会劳动人民受地主富农压迫和剥削的苦处。奶奶也常给我讲家史。对比一下，我就想到：新社会的儿童真太幸福了，不愁吃，不愁穿，又读书，又劳动，整天价心里乐滋滋的。邓拓这伙坏蛋，妄想让地主资本家重新骑到我们头上，让我们象老一辈那样当牛做马，我们决不答应！
    邓拓这个大坏蛋，还编造一个孩子写的一首诗来恶毒地咒骂毛主席说的“东风压倒西风”是“陈词滥调”，不让我们少年儿童写东风、西风、恩人、敌人。他的目的，就是不让我们听毛主席的话。告诉你，邓拓，毛主席的话，我们永远要听。毛主席的话，照亮了每一个劳动人民的心，也照亮了每一个少年儿童的心。我们少年儿童读了毛主席的书，学了毛主席的语录，一个个心红眼亮，更加热爱我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，更加认清了谁是敌人，谁是朋友，谁是好人，谁是坏人。
    我们要永远热爱伟大的共产党，热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，永远听党的话，听毛主席的话，好好学习，天天向上，做毛主席的好孩子，做红色革命接班人，和叔叔伯伯们一起，打倒邓拓这伙坏蛋！
