Title: Shelter for the Black Shop Owner

    The current vigorous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death class struggle. To thoroughly eliminate this anti-Party and anti-socialist black line and completely smash the frenzied attacks of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, we actively respond to the Party's call and throw ourselves into the struggle to defend the Party and defend socialism. To this end, we wrote an article entitled "Look at the Heinous Crimes Wu Han Committed in the History Department of Beijing Normal University" (see "Beijing Daily" May 6, 1966), exposing and criticizing Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist ideas, and sent it to the "Beijing Daily." Comrades! It was truly not easy for this article to be published! This was the result of our fierce struggle with the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily."
    We sent the manuscript to the "Beijing Daily" on April 29th. They suppressed the manuscript for four or five days. When we inquired, they pretended not to have seen the manuscript (didn't they really see it? There's more to this). On May 4th, because the "People's Daily" was going to publish this article, they hurriedly asked us for a copy of the manuscript. After we sent the manuscript again, they called and said that our manuscript "raised the bar too high and lacked sufficient material," and sent us a galley proof that they had revised. When we received this galley proof, we were shocked. With a stroke of their pen, they erased all the basic points of our article, that is, the key points that could most effectively strike at Wu Han's vitals. Please see how the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily" tampered with our manuscript.
    A subheading in our original manuscript was that Wu Han "coordinated with right-leaning opportunists on the education front to attack the Party." The editorial department changed it to "Opposing the Great Revolution in Education," and erased all the arguments we made in the original manuscript that Wu Han cooperated with right-leaning opportunists in 1959 to attack the Party and attack the Three Red Banners, even erasing the phrase "right-leaning opportunists." From this, it seems that the editorial department not only feared that others would expose the fact that Wu Han cooperated with right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party, but also reduced Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes to merely opposing the educational policy, even "protecting" the right-leaning opportunists.
    The second subheading in our original manuscript was that Wu Han "paved the way for feudal and capitalist forces attempting to restore themselves, and tried his best to obstruct and undermine teachers and students from participating in the socialist education movement." The editorial department changed it to "Corrupting Youth and Competing with the Party for Successors," and cut out our original manuscript's criticism of Wu Han for paving the way for the restoration of feudal forces and capitalist forces in the ideological field, replacing it with Wu Han "treating our department as a position for him to compete for the younger generation." In this way, it becomes that Wu Han had nothing to do with the frantic restoration activities of a handful of landlords and bourgeois elements who were unwilling to die in 1959-1961. The editorial department also completely erased the passage in the original manuscript, "In Wu Han's view, if we do not talk about the 'roles' of Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, Wang Jingwei, and Chiang Kai-shek, and do not praise them, there is nothing to talk about in modern Chinese history." Wu Han was afraid of exposing his criminal history as a "strategist" for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule in the 1930s and 1940s, and the editorial department was also afraid of us mentioning that Wu Han still never forgot to praise Chiang Kai-shek in the 1960s. Our original manuscript's criticism that Wu Han in the 1960s was the same as Hu Shi in the 1930s, and tried his best to obstruct young people from participating in the socialist education movement, was tampered with to become Wu Han competing with the Party for revolutionary successors. After this revision, Wu Han's crimes became much smaller.
    The "Beijing Daily" pretended to want us to criticize Wu Han, but truly criticizing Wu Han would strike at Wu Han and hurt the "Beijing Daily's" heart. Therefore, they can only adopt the two-faced tactics of false criticism and true cover-up, false struggle and true protection. When we raised objections on the phone, the editor of the theory department of the "Beijing Daily" said: "Wu Han coordinated with right-leaning opportunists on the education front to frantically attack the Party" was "raising the bar too high and lacking sufficient facts"; Wu Han "paved the way for feudal forces and capitalist forces attempting to restore themselves, and tried his best to obstruct and undermine teachers and students from participating in the socialist education movement" was "far-fetched"! And said: The editorial department's revised manuscript has been reviewed by the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee, and they cannot make changes. This editor insisted that we agree to publish their revised manuscript. In order to uphold the truth, defend the Party, and defend socialism, we personally went to the editorial department to state our reasons. In this way, they reluctantly agreed to publish according to our manuscript.
    Please note, all of this happened after the "Liberation Army Daily's" editorials "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution" and "Never Forget Class Struggle" were published! We want to ask: Why did the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily" delete all the most combative parts of our article, the parts that could most effectively strike at Wu Han's vitals? Who exactly is the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily" speaking for? Who are they supporting? Who are they running the newspaper for?
    In previous years, the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily" was a tool for the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" black shop owners. Today, when the people of the whole country are denouncing these anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily" has become a shelter and hiding place for the "Three-Family Village" black shop owners. Therefore, we believe that the errors of the editorial department of the "Beijing Daily" must be thoroughly exposed and criticized.

    黑店老板的庇护所
    北京师范学院历史系
    当前正在进行的轰轰烈烈的文化大革命，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。为了彻底搞掉这条反党反社会主义的黑线，彻底打垮反党反社会主义分子的猖狂进攻，我们积极响应党的号召，投入保卫党保卫社会主义的斗争中。为此，我们写了一篇《看，吴晗在北京师范学院历史系干了些什么罪恶勾当》（见《北京日报》一九六六年五月六日），揭发和批判吴晗反党反社会主义的思想，寄给了《北京日报》。同志们！这篇稿子登出来可真不容易啊！这是我们与《北京日报》编辑部进行了激烈的斗争的结果。
    我们在四月二十九日把稿子寄到《北京日报》。他们把这篇稿子压了四五天。当我们催问时，他们佯称没见到稿子（是不是没见到？这里还大有文章）。五月四日，因为《人民日报》要登这篇文章，他们才急急忙忙向我们要了这篇稿子的副本。我们再次寄去这篇稿子之后，他们来电话说我们的稿子“提的太高，材料不多”，并寄来一份他们修改过的清样。我们收到这份清样，不禁大吃一惊。他们大笔一挥，把我们文章的基本观点，也即是最能打击吴晗要害的关键地方，全部抹掉了。请看《北京日报》编辑部是如何篡改我们的稿件吧。
    我们原稿的一个小题目是，吴晗“在教育战线上配合右倾机会主义分子向党进攻”。编辑部把它改成《反对教育大革命》，把我们原稿中提出的吴晗在一九五九年配合右倾机会主义分子攻击党攻击三面红旗的论点全部抹去了，连同右倾机会主义分子的词也一起抹去。由此看来，编辑部不仅害怕别人把吴晗配合右倾机会主义分子向党进攻的事实揭出来，而且把吴晗的反党反社会主义的罪行降低到只反对教育方针，连右倾机会主义分子也加以“保护”。
    我们原稿的第二个题目是，吴晗《为企图复辟的封建主义势力和资本主义势力鸣锣开道，竭力阻挠破坏师生参加社会主义教育运动》。编辑部把它改为《腐蚀青年，与党争夺接班人》，把我们原稿中批判吴晗在思想意识形态领域内为封建势力和资本主义势力复辟鸣锣开道的论点砍去了，换上吴晗“把我系当成他争夺青年一代的一个阵地”。这样一来，就变成吴晗与一九五九到一九六一年一小撮不甘心死亡的地主、资产阶级分子疯狂的复辟活动没有什么关系了。编辑部还把原稿中“在吴晗看来，如果不讲曾国藩、李鸿章、汪精卫、蒋介石的‘作用’，不为他们歌功颂德，中国近代史就无可谈之事”一段话全抹去。吴晗怕揭露他在三十——四十年代是蒋介石反动统治的“谋士”的罪恶历史，编辑部也怕我们提到六十年代吴晗还念念不忘为蒋介石歌功颂德。我们原稿中批判六十年代的吴晗就是三十年代的胡适，极力阻挠青年参加社会主义教育运动的观点，被篡改成吴晗与党争夺革命接班人。经这一改，吴晗的罪恶就小得多了。
    《北京日报》装出一副要我们批判吴晗的样子，但真正批判了吴晗，就打在吴晗身上，痛在《北京日报》心上。因此，他们只能采取假批判、真掩护，假斗争、真包庇的两面手法。当我们在电话中提出不同意见时，《北京日报》理论部的编辑同志说：“吴晗在教育战线上配合右倾机会主义分子猖狂向党进攻”是“提得太高，事实不足”；吴晗“为企图复辟的封建势力、资本主义势力鸣锣开道，竭力阻挠破坏师生参加社会主义教育运动”是“牵强”！并说：编辑部修改的稿子已经市委领导同志看过，他们不好改动了。这位编辑同志硬要我们同意发表他们修改的稿子。我们为了坚持真理，保卫党，保卫社会主义，亲自去编辑部申述我们的理由。这样，他们才勉强同意按我们的稿子发表了。
    请读者注意，所有这一切都发生在《解放军报》的《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》和《千万不要忘记阶级斗争》两篇社论发表之后！我们要问：《北京日报》编辑部为什么把我们文章中最有战斗力的部分、最能够打击吴晗要害的地方全部勾掉了呢？《北京日报》编辑部究竟在替谁说话？为谁撑腰？为谁办报？
    前几年，《北京日报》编辑部是“三家村”黑店老板们反党反社会主义的工具。今天当全国人民声讨这些反党反社会主义分子时，《北京日报》编辑部又成了“三家村”黑店老板们的掩护所、藏身地。因此我们认为，《北京日报》编辑部的错误大有彻底揭露批判的必要。
