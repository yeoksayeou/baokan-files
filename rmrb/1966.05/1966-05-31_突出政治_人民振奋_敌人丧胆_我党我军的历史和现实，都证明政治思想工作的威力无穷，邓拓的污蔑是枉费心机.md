    Highlight Politics, People Rejoice, Enemies Tremble
    Our Party and Army's History and Reality Prove the Infinite Power of Political and Ideological Work, Deng Tuo's Slander is a Futile Attempt
    Combat Hero, Deputy Director of the Political Department of a Certain Regiment of the PLA, Yang Daogen
    The anti-Party element Deng Tuo, in his article "Two Foreign Fables," viciously attacked our Party as "Machists" and attacked our Party for "exaggerating the role of so-called 'psychological factors'" during the Great Leap Forward. He also nonsensically said that "the Machists think that relying on the role of their psychological factors, they can do whatever they want, but the result can only be that they will be battered and bloodied in the face of actual things, and in the end, the bankruptcy of the Machists will inevitably be declared." This poisonous arrow blatantly attacked our Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the principles of political work put forward by the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao. Chairman Mao taught us that politics is the commander, is the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. Comrade Lin Biao, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, put forward the principle of "Four Firsts," which is the foundation of the construction of our Party and our army, and anti-Party element Deng Tuo is absolutely not allowed to slander it.
    Anti-Party element Deng Tuo slandered us for exaggerating the role of psychological factors. We solemnly tell Deng Tuo that we are not exaggerating the role of psychological factors, but emphasizing the role of political and ideological work. The Party and Chairman Mao taught us that under certain material conditions, people's thinking plays a decisive role. This is not idealism, but dialectical materialism; it precisely avoids mechanical materialism. Shouldn't our proletarian party and the people's army emphasize political and ideological work? If we do not emphasize political and ideological work, wouldn't we be in collusion with modern revisionism and people like Deng Tuo? The more the class enemies do not want us to emphasize something, the more we should emphasize it. This proves that our emphasis on the role of political and ideological work is completely correct.
    We want to ask Deng Tuo, opening up the history of the Chinese revolution, which point does not illustrate the importance of political and ideological work? Our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, under extremely difficult conditions, successfully completed the unprecedented 25,000-li Long March. Wasn't that relying on politics? We used millet plus rifles to defeat the Japanese imperialists armed to the teeth. Wasn't that relying on politics? We defeated the eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops with superior equipment with inferior equipment. Wasn't that relying on politics? We, together with the Korean people, defeated the world's number one imperialist United States aggressor army on the Korean battlefield. Wasn't that relying on politics? The reason we were able to achieve these victories was entirely due to highlighting politics and relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Anti-Party element Deng Tuo, why don't you open your eyes and look at revolutionary history?
    Take today as an example. Doesn't our state organs, army, and people rely on political and ideological work to mobilize people's positive factors in doing every job well? A few years ago, our people overcame natural disasters unseen in decades, and overcame the blockade of imperialism and modern revisionism against us. Wasn't that relying on the unity of the people of the whole country, relying on self-reliance, and relying on "people's factor first"? Among the many heroic and model figures in our army, which one did not overwhelm the enemy because they armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought? Wang Jie sacrificed himself to save others, Mai Xiande insisted on fighting to victory in a state of serious injury and coma, and Ouyang Hai sacrificed himself to rescue the train. All of these, didn't they fully develop people's subjective initiative and fully develop the power of highlighting politics? Deng Tuo, why don't you open your eyes and look at revolutionary reality?
    I have a personal understanding of whether or not to develop people's subjective initiative. Last year, I went to the health section to serve as a political liaison. Under the collective leadership of the Party branch, due to adhering to putting politics in command and fully mobilizing people's positive factors, we also rescued many critically ill patients who were previously considered difficult to rescue. Once, a critically ill patient with a perforated stomach was unconscious. If we transferred him to another hospital, he would definitely die on the way. If we didn't transfer him, we didn't have enough experience in treating this kind of critically ill patient. However, all the medical staff, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, and finally successfully operated on the patient and saved the patient. Why were things that were previously considered impossible now possible? The people are still the same people, and the technical level is the same. The main thing is that people's thinking has changed, and people's enthusiasm has been fully developed. There are many such examples. We want to ask Deng Tuo, why slander our political and ideological work?
    The history and reality of our Party and our army highlighting politics is not something that anti-Party elements like Deng Tuo cannot see. They not only saw it, but also saw clearly that highlighting politics is the lifeline of our Party and our army. They are precisely extremely hostile to this "lifeline," and only then do they try every means to fire black guns at this principled issue, in order to realize capitalist restoration. We warn Deng Tuo that highlighting politics is the principle of our Party and our army, and anti-Party elements are absolutely not allowed to slander it. We, the People's Liberation Army, like the people of the whole country, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, must adhere to the Four Firsts, and must fully develop people's positive factors. Deng Tuo, your attempt to slander the principles of political work of our Party and our army is a futile attempt.

    突出政治　人民振奋　敌人丧胆
    我党我军的历史和现实，都证明政治思想工作的威力无穷，邓拓的污蔑是枉费心机
    战斗英雄、解放军某部团政治处副主任　杨道根
    反党分子邓拓，在《两则外国寓言》一文中，恶毒地攻击我们党是“马赫派”，攻击我们党在大跃进中“夸大了所谓
  ‘心理要素’的作用”。他还胡说什么“马赫派自以为凭着他们的心理要素的作用，就能够为所欲为，而其结果，只能在实际的事物面前碰得头破血流，最后必然要宣告马赫派的破产。”这支毒箭很露骨地攻击我们党中央、毛主席，攻击军委、林彪同志提出的政治工作的原则。毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。林彪同志根据毛主席的教导，提出了“四个第一”的原则，这是我党我军建设的根本，绝不允许反党分子邓拓污蔑。
    反党分子邓拓污蔑我们夸大了心理要素的作用。我们正告邓拓，我们不是夸大了心理要素的作用，而是强调了政治思想工作的作用。党和毛主席教导我们，在一定的物质条件下，人的思想起决定的作用，这不是唯心论，而是辩证唯物论；正是避免了机械唯物论。难道我们无产阶级的政党，人民军队不应该强调政治思想工作吗？我们要是不强调政治思想工作，不是和现代修正主义、邓拓之流同流合污了吗？凡是阶级敌人不要我们强调的东西，我们越是应该强调。这证明我们强调政治思想工作的作用，完全是正确的。
    我们要问邓拓，翻开中国革命的历史，那一点不说明政治思想工作的重要呢？我们工农红军在极端艰苦困难的情况下，顺利地完成了史无前例的两万五千里长征，这不是靠政治靠什么？我们用小米加步枪，打败了武装到牙齿的日本帝国主义，不是靠政治靠什么？我们以劣势装备，战胜了优势装备的八百万蒋匪军，不是靠政治靠什么？我们和朝鲜人民一道，在朝鲜战场上，打败了世界上头号帝国主义美国侵略军，不是靠政治靠什么？我们所以能取得这些胜利，无一不是靠突出政治，靠毛泽东思想。反党分子邓拓，你为什么不睁开眼睛看一看革命历史呢？
    就拿今天来说，我们国家机关、军队、人民，做好每一样工作，难道不是靠政治思想工作调动人的积极因素吗？几年前，我国人民战胜了几十年未有的自然灾害，战胜了帝国主义、现代修正主义对我们的封锁，难道不是靠全国人民团结一致，靠自力更生，靠“人的因素第一”吗？在我军的许多英雄模范人物中，哪一个不是由于用毛泽东思想武装了头脑才压倒了敌人呢？王杰舍己救人，麦贤得在重伤昏迷的情况下坚持到战斗胜利，欧阳海舍身抢救列车，所有这些，难道不是充分发挥了人的主观能动性，充分发挥了突出政治的威力吗？邓拓，你为什么不睁开眼睛看一看革命现实呢？
    对于要不要发挥人的主观能动性，我是有切身体会的。去年我到卫生科担任政治协理员。在党支部的集体领导下，由于坚持了政治挂帅，充分调动了人的积极因素，许多过去被认为很难抢救的危急病人，我们也抢救过来了。有一次，一个患胃穿孔的重病人昏迷不醒，转院吧，一定会在途中死去，不转院吧，治疗这种危急病人经验不足。但是全体医护人员在毛泽东思想的指引下，发扬了救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，终于顺利地为病人开了刀，挽救了这个病人。为什么过去认为办不到的事情现在办到了？人还是原来的那些人，技术水平也一样，主要是人的思想变化了，充分发挥了人的积极性。象这样的例子多得很。我们要问邓拓，为什么要污蔑我们的政治思想工作呢？
    我党我军突出政治的历史和现实，反党分子邓拓之流不是看不见，他们不但看见了，而且看清了突出政治是我党我军的生命线。他们正是极端仇视这条“生命线”，才千方百计地对准这个原则问题放黑枪，以便实现资本主义复辟。我们警告邓拓，突出政治是我党我军的原则，绝不容许反党分子污蔑。我们人民解放军和全国人民一样，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，一定要坚持四个第一、一定要充分发挥人的积极因素。邓拓你要污蔑我党我军政治工作原则，那是枉费心机。
