    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 11th: People from all walks of life in Japan have spoken to reporters from the Japanese News Agency, warmly welcoming the success of China's nuclear explosion on the 9th.
    Yoshitaro Hirano, Chairman of the Japan Peace Committee, said that China's new nuclear test is to counter the US imperialism's expansion of nuclear war bases in Japan and other places, and its intensification of nuclear intimidation against China. He said that it is also to support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed people and countries.
    Hirano pointed out that US imperialism is expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and US Secretary of Defense McNamara has said that the use of nuclear weapons against Vietnam and China should not be obstructed. He said that at such a time, it is urgent to convene a summit conference of heads of state of all countries to discuss the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
    He refuted the Sato government's attacks on China's nuclear tests. He said: "The Sato government has accepted the US imperialism's nuclear umbrella, adopted a hostile attitude towards China, and regarded China as a hypothetical enemy. Such a government is not qualified to talk about China's nuclear tests. All its remarks in this regard are deceptive."
    Tokumatsu Sakamoto, Director-General of the Japan Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, said that the success of China's nuclear tests has in fact proved that the imperialists' actions of using nuclear weapons for intimidation can be defeated.
    Sakamoto called on leaders of all countries to seriously consider convening a summit conference of heads of state of all countries to discuss the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.
    Seimin Miyazaki, Director-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said that China's development of nuclear weapons is a contribution to safeguarding peace and to the liberation struggles of the people of Asian countries.
    Seimin Miyazaki said: "The Chinese government has declared that China will never, at any time or under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons, and that China will strive to achieve the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. The Chinese government's statement is completely trustworthy."
    Seimin Miyazaki condemned some shameless people in Japan for discussing the so-called nuclear "threat" from China, and using this as an excuse to rely on the United States and realize their evil desire for militarization. He said, however, that the Japanese people see China's nuclear explosion as an effort to safeguard peace.
    Yuichi Kobayashi, Chairman of the Japan Journalists Conference, emphasized that China's successful nuclear test will strike at the US imperialism's policy of expanding its war of aggression and encourage the Japanese people to struggle against the Sato government's policy of colluding with the United States and being hostile to China.
    Yuichi Kobayashi called on progressive Japanese journalists to work hard to smash the deceptive propaganda of the US and Japanese reactionaries, who say that China's possession of nuclear weapons is a "threat" to the people of Asia, including the Japanese people.
    Commentator Yoko Matsuoka said that the Japanese people are very moved to see that the development of science and technology in China is faster than previously expected, although the Japanese government is shocked and embarrassed by the news of China's nuclear test.
    Keizo Kamiyama, Deputy Secretary-General of the Japanese Scientists' Conference, pointed out that the United States is carrying out inhumane massacres and expanding the war in Vietnam. Under these circumstances, it is completely reasonable for China to develop nuclear weapons to defend its own people and country, as well as to defend peace in Asia and the world.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 11th: Masayoshi Oka, member of the Central Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on China's third nuclear test on the 10th. The full text is as follows:
    The People's Republic of China conducted its third nuclear test on the 9th. Since China conducted its first nuclear test the year before last, our party has expressed its views on each of its tests. Now, the fact that US imperialism surrounds China with its huge nuclear war potential, plots to launch an aggression against China with a nuclear attack, and invades Asia through nuclear blackmail is a well-known fact.
    It is clear that China was forced to conduct this latest nuclear test in order to ensure its own security from the threat of US imperialism's nuclear war policy. China has taken this measure "entirely for defense" (Chinese government statement). Since conducting its first nuclear test the year before last, the Chinese government has repeatedly announced that "China will never, at any time or under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons" and has demanded that all countries possessing nuclear weapons conclude an agreement banning nuclear weapons and banning the use of nuclear weapons. US imperialism stubbornly refuses this demand. It opposes the prohibition of nuclear weapons and even insists on having the "right to use nuclear weapons first." This shows who is the provocateur of nuclear war.
    Regarding this Chinese nuclear test, many people have expressed concern about the adverse effects of the resulting radioactive fallout. Our party has always believed that the only way to eliminate this concern is to fight against US imperialism's nuclear war policy, thereby promoting the realization of the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. Our party has waged an unyielding struggle for this purpose.
    As some people advocate, using the Japanese people's concern about China's nuclear tests to organize protests can only weaken the struggle against US imperialism and for the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons. This is tantamount to helping the US-Japanese ruling class, who, under the pretext of China's development of nuclear weapons, are conspiring to realize Japan's nuclear armament.
    Our party will work with all people who hope to maintain the true security of Japan and world peace to fight for the complete prohibition of nuclear weapons, to smash the US imperialism and the Sato cabinet's "contain China" policy, and to oppose the policy of turning Japan into a nuclear war base and arming Japan with nuclear weapons.

    中国第三次核爆炸鼓励了日本人民斗争
    日共领导人冈正芳说中国进行核试验完全是为了自卫
    日本公众领袖纷纷驳斥佐藤政府对中国核试验的攻击
    新华社十一日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士向日本新闻社记者发表谈话，热烈欢迎中国九日进行的核爆炸成功。
    日本和平委员会会长平野义太郎说，中国进行新的核试验，是为了对付美帝国主义在日本和其它地方扩大核战争基地和加紧对中国进行核恫吓。他说，这也是为了支持所有被压迫人民和国家的革命斗争。
    平野指出，美帝国主义正在扩大侵越战争，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉曾经说过，对越南和中国使用核武器不应当受到阻挠。他说，在这样一个时候，迫切地需要召开世界各国政府首脑会议讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器问题。
    他驳斥了佐藤政府对中国核试验的攻击。他说：“佐藤政府接受了美帝国主义的核保护伞，对中国采取敌视态度，把中国看作假想敌，这样的政府没有资格谈中国的核试验。它关于这方面的一切言论都是骗人的。”
    日本亚非团结委员会理事长坂本德松说，中国核试验的成功，事实上证明了帝国主义利用核武器进行恫吓的行动是可以挫败的。
    坂本呼吁各国领导人认真考虑关于召开世界各国政府首脑会议，讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器问题。
    日中友协理事长宫崎世民说，中国发展核武器，是对保卫和平和对亚洲各国人民的解放斗争的贡献。
    宫崎世民说：“中国政府声明，中国在任何时候，任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器，中国将为实现全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器而奋斗。中国政府的这一声明是完全信得过的。”
    宫崎世民谴责日本某些人士恬不知耻地在议论所谓中国的核“威胁”，并以此作为依附美国和实现军国主义化的邪恶愿望的借口。他说，但是，日本人民群众把中国的核爆炸看作是维护和平的努力。
    日本记者会议议长小林雄一强调指出，中国这次成功的核试验，将打击美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的政策，鼓励日本人民进行反对佐藤政府奉行同美国勾结和敌视中国的政策的斗争。
    小林雄一号召日本进步的新闻工作者努力工作，粉碎美国和日本反动派的欺骗宣传，它们说什么中国拥有核武器是对包括日本人民在内的亚洲人民的“威胁”。
    评论家松冈洋子说，日本人民看到中国科学技术的发展比早先预料的要快，因此很受感动，尽管日本政府对中国核试验的消息感到震惊和窘迫。
    日本科学家会议副秘书长神山惠三指出，美国正在越南进行毫无人性的屠杀和扩大战争。在这种情况下，中国发展核武器以保卫本国人民和国家以及保卫亚洲和世界和平，是完全合情合理的。
    新华社十一日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央政治局委员冈正芳十日就中国第三次核试验发表了谈话，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国九日进行了第三次核试验。自从中国在前年进行第一次核试验以来，我们党对它的每一次试验都发表了自己的见解。现在，美帝国主义以巨大的核战争潜力包围中国，策划以核进攻对中国发动侵略，并且通过核讹诈侵略亚洲，这已是人所共知的事实。
    很明显，中国是为了保证自己的安全不受美帝国主义核战争政策的威胁，而被迫进行最近这一次核试验的。中国“完全是为了防御”（中国政府声明）而采取这一措施的。中国政府自从前年进行第一次核试验以来，就一再宣布，“中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不会首先使用核武器”，并且要求一切拥有核武器的国家缔结禁止核武器和禁止使用核武器的协定。美帝国主义却顽固地拒绝这种要求，它反对禁止核武器，甚至坚持要有“首先使用核武器的权利”。这就表明了核战争的挑衅者是谁。
    对于中国这次核试验，许多人对随着而来的放射性散落物的不良作用表示担心。我们党一贯认为，消除这种忧虑的唯一途径是对美帝国主义的核战争政策作斗争，从而促使全面禁止核武器的实现。我们党为此不屈不挠地进行了斗争。
    象某些人所鼓吹的那样，利用日本人民对中国核试验的担心，来组织抗议活动，这只能削弱反对美帝国主义和争取全面禁止核武器的斗争。这也就等于帮助美日统治阶级，他们借口中国发展核武器，阴谋实现日本的核武装。
    我们党将同一切希望维护日本的真正安全与世界和平的人民一道，为实现全面禁止核武器而斗争，为粉碎美帝国主义和佐藤内阁的“遏制中国”政策而斗争，为反对变日本为核战争基地和以核武器武装日本的政策而斗争。
