    China-Albania Friendship is as Deep as the Adriatic Sea, as High as the Himalayas
    Albanian People Warmly Congratulate the Albanian Party and Government Delegation on its Visit to China
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 2nd – The Albanian people, with extreme excitement, congratulate the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu on its visit to China, and warmly cheer the militant unity and great friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania.
    Troshari, a technician at the Shkodër Wire Factory, said, "I studied in China for a year and deeply felt the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Albanian people. During the days of our Party and Government Delegation's visit to China, our people lived in a sea of joy. It was during this visit that our factory held its commissioning ceremony. This factory is the result of close cooperation between Chinese and Albanian experts and Albanian workers, and is another symbol of China-Albania friendship. The China-Albania friendship forged by the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha is as deep as the Adriatic Sea and as high as the Himalayas."
    Mullai, a member of the Bardena Agricultural Cooperative in the Lezhë District, said, "I was very happy to see in the newspapers the news of our Party and Government Delegation's visit to China and the extremely warm welcome they received in China. Although the great Chinese people are geographically far away from us, the hearts of our two peoples have long been linked together. There is an Albanian proverb: 'A friend in need is a friend indeed.' It is in difficult times that our two parties and the people of our two countries have formed a militant friendship. After the Soviet revisionists unreasonably severed relations with Albania, China provided selfless assistance to our country's Third and Fourth Five-Year Plans. The 'Dongfanghong' tractors used in our cooperative are a vivid example."
    Masiu, an officer of the Albanian People's Army who visited China in 1964, said that Comrade Shehu's visit to China with the Party and Government Delegation is a major event that will further strengthen the unity and friendship between our two parties and the people of our two countries. Our friendship has developed in the common struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism represented by the leaders of the CPSU. Our friendship best demonstrates the brotherly and comradely relations between large and small parties, large and small countries, and the people of large and small countries.
    Kesi, a young soldier of the Albanian People's Army, said, "I was very excited when I saw in the newspaper the news of our Party and Government Delegation's visit to China and the very grand reception they received from Chairman Liu Shaoqi and other Chinese party and government leaders and the Chinese people. Our party educates us to be revolutionary soldiers, to know how to hate the enemy and how to love our comrades."
    Albanian famous poet A. Çajupi enthusiastically praised the friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania with beautiful verses. In a poem entitled "Revolutionary Salute," he wrote:
    In this exciting moment,
    How close our two peoples are.
    Rivers, mountains and oceans,
    How can they separate our friendship!
    The red flag will fly all over the world,
    No one can stop it,
    Whether it is Khrushchev,
    Or his disciples.
    Bombs and dollars cannot make us surrender,
    Who else can compete with us?
    Marxism-Leninism makes us
    Like lightning and fire!

    中阿友谊象亚得里亚海一样深，喜马拉雅山一样高
    阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈祝贺阿党政代表团访华
    据新华社地拉那二日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着极其兴奋的心情祝贺谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访华，并且热烈欢呼中阿两党和两国人民的战斗团结和伟大友谊。
    斯库台电线厂的技术工人特罗夏里说，“我在中国学习过一年，深深感到中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民的深情厚谊。在我国党政代表团访华的日子里，我国人民生活在欢乐的海洋中。正在这次访问期间，我们工厂举行了投入生产的仪式。这个工厂是中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国专家和阿尔巴尼亚工人紧密合作的成果，是中阿友谊的又一个象征。由以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所缔造起来的中阿友谊象亚得里亚海一样深，象喜马拉雅山一样高”。
    莱希区巴尔德纳农业合作社社员穆拉伊说，“我从报纸上看到我国党政代表团访华和他们在中国受到极其热烈的欢迎的消息，感到非常高兴。伟大的中国人民虽然在地理上和我们相距很远，但我们两国人民的心却早已联结在一起。阿尔巴尼亚有句谚语‘患难识知交’。正是在困难的日子里，我们两党、两国人民结成了战斗友谊。当苏联修正主义者无理断绝同阿尔巴尼亚的关系以后，中国为我国的第三个和第四个五年计划提供了无私的援助。在我们这个社里所使用的‘东方红’牌拖拉机，就是一个生动的事例。
    曾经在一九六四年到中国访问过的阿尔巴尼亚人民军军官马西乌说，谢胡同志率领党政代表团访华是一个重大的事件，将进一步加强我们两党、两国人民之间的团结和友谊。我们的友谊是在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导为代表的现代修正主义的共同斗争中发展起来的。我们的友谊最好地表现了大党和小党、大国和小国、大国人民和小国人民之间的兄弟、同志的关系。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军青年战士凯西说，“我从报纸上看到我国党政代表团访华和他们受到刘少奇主席等中国党政领导人和中国人民的非常隆重的接待的消息，感到无比兴奋。我们党教育我们做一个革命的战士，懂得如何仇恨敌人，又懂得如何热爱自己的同志。”
    阿尔巴尼亚著名诗人阿·恰奇以美丽的诗句热情歌颂中阿两党和两国人民的友谊。他在一首题为《革命的敬礼》诗歌中这样写道：
    在这激动人心的时刻，
    我们两国人民多么亲近。
    江河、高山和大洋，
    怎能分得开我们的友情！
    红旗将在全世界飘扬，
    谁也阻挡不住，
    不论是赫鲁晓夫，
    还是他的门徒。
    炸弹和美元不能使我们投降，
    还有谁能同我们较量？
    马列主义使我们变得
    象烈火闪电一样！
