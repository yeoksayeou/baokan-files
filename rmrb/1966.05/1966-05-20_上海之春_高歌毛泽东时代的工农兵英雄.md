    "Shanghai Spring" Praises Worker-Peasant-Soldier Heroes of the Mao Zedong Era
    The "Ode to Heroes" Special Concert is deeply loved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They commented: This kind of "Ode to Heroes" speaks for us, strengthens our revolutionary aspirations. This is the song of the era we love to hear; this is the socialist music we need.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th – The ongoing 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival has recently presented two "Ode to Heroes" special concerts. More than 300 musicians, filled with revolutionary fervor, sang the praises of contemporary worker-peasant-soldier heroes who emerged under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Striving to shape worker-peasant-soldier heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental task of socialist literature and art. The "Ode to Heroes" special concert sang the praises of the great communist fighters Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Ouyang Hai, as well as the proletarian hard-bone Mai Xiande, and Chairman Mao’s good student Jiao Yulu; sang the praises of Daqing’s "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi, the Party Branch Secretary Chen Yonggui who led Dazhai peasants in transforming heaven and earth, and the diplomat Zhao Xiaoshou who staunchly defended the five-star red flag; sang the praises of Shanghai’s pacesetters in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, Cai Zuquan, Yang Fuzhen, Yang Huaiyuan, and the young people of the Red Thunder Team.
    This is the most concentrated concert in the history of "Shanghai Spring" to praise the heroes of the socialist era. These heroic images, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and full of the proletarian spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, aroused the audience's boiling revolutionary feelings. Many programs were repeatedly performed at the audience's request.
    At the concert, "Iron Man Wang," a duet by two tenor singers, praised the heroic deeds of Daqing's Iron Man Wang Jinxi, who, under the leadership of the Party, worked hard with the broad masses of workers to build the petroleum industry through self-reliance. The song, based on the robust and cheerful northern folk songs, expressed the Daqing oil workers' heroic spirit of "basing ourselves on the oil field and looking out at the world" and the revolutionary optimism of "regarding hardship as happiness" for the sake of revolution.
    The solo "Dare to Teach the Sun and Moon to Change to a New Sky," with its cheerful melody from the beginning, brought the audience into the flourishing Dazhai mountainous area after the transformation of heaven and earth. Chen Yonggui, the heroic image of the Dazhai people, appeared majestically in the warm and inspiring singing. It was he who led the Dazhai people in building dams in the frozen sky, moving high mountains in the snowy ground, carrying rubble and bricks with shoulder poles, and hoeing out fields of rice and grain with hoes. The picture of hard work and self-reliance depicted by the solo gave the audience a strong impression.
    More than 90 actors from six different opera genres in Shanghai – Peking Opera, Kunqu Opera, Shanghai Opera, Yue Opera, Comic Opera, and Drama – performed the magnificent grand chorus "Singing of Wang Jie, Learning from Wang Jie." This chorus consisted of seven songs, which vividly depicted the glorious life of this great revolutionary fighter who was unafraid of hardship and death, and the magnificent scene of millions of young people across the country, inspired by his revolutionary spirit, taking up their pens to write revolutionary diaries, and carrying Wang Jie’s gun to fight to the end for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.
    The concentrated appearance of so many glorious worker-peasant-soldier heroic images at one concert, with its heart-stirring power, opened up a new situation in the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival of expressing the revolutionary feelings of the proletariat, and powerfully hammering the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line.
    These programs praising heroes are the initial achievements of Shanghai musicians in following the literary and artistic direction formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao, going deep into the struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and constantly transforming their ideology and feelings. Many musicians have a common understanding: to sing the praises of worker-peasant-soldier heroes, we must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our world outlook and artistic outlook; to sing the praises of worker-peasant-soldier heroes, we must integrate ourselves with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and equip ourselves with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers; to sing the praises of worker-peasant-soldier heroes, we must earnestly learn from worker-peasant-soldier heroes and take them as our role models.
    The success of the creation and performance of the grand chorus "Singing of Wang Jie, Learning from Wang Jie" in this "Ode to Heroes" special concert is a powerful proof. The authors of this chorus were not famous composers, nor were the singers those well-known vocalists. Its creators and performers were some actors from Shanghai's six opera genres. Since last year, they have often gone to the rural areas in the suburbs with Chairman Mao's works, delved into life, worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and participated in the socialist education movement, gradually being influenced by the thoughts and feelings of the working people. After reading "Wang Jie's Diary," they studied Wang Jie with strong class feelings and the poor and lower-middle peasants. Inspired by the spirit of Wang Jie, they successively wrote seven songs praising Wang Jie in a relatively short period of time.
    In the creative process, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," striving to write draft after draft based on the standard of what the peasants love to hear and can sing. After it was written, they sang it with the poor and lower-middle peasants and revised it repeatedly based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The grand chorus "Singing of Wang Jie, Learning from Wang Jie" was born under the inspiration of the revolutionary feelings of learning from heroes and on a broad mass basis.
    The creation and performance of many programs in this special concert reflect the fact that to sing of heroes, one must first learn from heroes. When Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds were published in the newspapers, Shanghai musicians immediately launched a wave of learning from Jiao Yulu and performing Jiao Yulu. Many units organized creators and performers to go to Lankao County, Henan Province, to delve into life and learn about and study the revolutionary spirit of the Lankao people in overcoming the "three evils" and changing the face of nature under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The song "Chairman Mao's Good Student" and the Pingtan piece "Giving All My Heart to the People" performed at this special concert were written during this study process.
    Starting from the requirements of shaping heroic figures, the musicians emancipated their minds, broke through the old framework that restricted new content, and used various forms of musical art, which have been further developed. The above examples show how much creative power literary and art workers will have as long as they follow the Mao Zedong literary and art direction! How vast the world is for literary and art workers!
    The law of development of objective things tells us that to develop socialist literature and art, to make the images of worker-peasant-soldier heroes stand firmly on the stage, will never be smooth sailing, and will never be achieved without serious struggle. Three years ago, when young Shanghai musicians began to sing the praises of the great communist fighter Lei Feng, they were stubbornly opposed by some bourgeois music "authorities," who said that this kind of song was "stiff and unlyrical"; they said that this kind of song was "too simple, without flavor, and wouldn't last long." However, the revolutionary young musicians were not shaken by this evil wind. They firmly and enthusiastically sang the praises of Lei Feng. They said that as long as the workers, peasants, and soldiers like the songs, we will sing them. Facts have proved that they are absolutely right to do so. In the past three years, they have sung Lei Feng countless times in factories and rural areas. In recent years, they have also sung the praises of Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and many other heroes, and the songs praising the heroes of the Mao Zedong era have been sung louder and louder, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Their own revolutionary feelings have also become more and more abundant. At the "Ode to Heroes" special concert of the "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival, many solos, duets, choruses, performance singing, grand choruses, and diverse forms of instrumental performances that sang the praises of worker-peasant-soldier heroes fully expressed the revolutionary spirit of the heroes and had great appeal. People said as soon as they heard them: this kind of song has flavor, makes people feel high-spirited, and doubles their revolutionary feelings. Some songs praising Lei Feng have been popular among the broad masses for three years, and the audience still applauded enthusiastically for the performance of this program. Contrary to what some bourgeois music "authorities" said, songs praising worker-peasant-soldier heroes have infinite vitality; it is precisely their musical works that are empty in content and express bourgeois sentiments that do not last long. Many musicians are unwilling to sing these works, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers do not want to listen to them. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love concerts like the "Ode to Heroes." They wrote articles in the newspapers commenting: This kind of "Ode to Heroes" speaks for us, strengthens our revolutionary aspirations. This is the song of the era we love to hear; this is the socialist music we need.

### “上海之春”高歌毛泽东时代的工农兵英雄

    大抒无产阶级革命之情  有力锤击反党反社会主义黑线
    “上海之春”高歌毛泽东时代的工农兵英雄
    “英雄赞歌”专场音乐会，深受广大工农兵的喜爱。他们评论说：这样的“英雄赞歌”，替我们说了话，长了革命志气，这才是我们爱听的时代歌声，这才是我们需要的社会主义音乐
    新华社上海十九日电　正在举行的第七届“上海之春”音乐会，最近连续两次演出了“英雄赞歌”专场。三百多个音乐工作者满怀革命激情，歌颂了在毛泽东思想哺育下涌现的当代工农兵英雄人物。
    努力塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄人物，是社会主义文艺的根本任务。“英雄赞歌”专场，歌唱了伟大的共产主义战士雷锋、王杰、欧阳海，以及无产阶级硬骨头麦贤得，毛主席的好学生焦裕禄；歌唱了大庆“铁人”王进喜，带领大寨农民改天换地的党支部书记陈永贵，坚贞不屈保卫五星红旗的外交人员赵小寿；歌唱了上海活学活用毛主席著作的标兵蔡祖泉、杨富珍、杨怀远和红雷小组的青年人。
    这是历届“上海之春”最集中地歌颂社会主义时代英雄人物的一次音乐会。通过音乐展现出来的这些闪烁着毛泽东思想光芒、充满无产阶级不断革命、彻底革命精神的英雄形象，激起了观众沸腾的革命感情，许多节目在观众要求下一再重演重唱。
    音乐会上，有两个男高音歌唱演员对唱的《王铁人》，歌颂了头顶青天脚踏草地的大庆铁人王进喜在党领导下，同广大职工一道艰苦奋斗、自力更生建设石油工业的英雄事迹。歌唱以刚健爽朗的北方民歌为基调，表达了大庆油田工人“立足油田望世界”的豪迈气概和为革命“把艰苦当作幸福”的革命乐观主义精神。
    女声独唱《敢教日月换新天》，一开始便以欢快的旋律，把观众带进了改天换地后一片兴旺的大寨山区。陈永贵，这个大寨人的英雄形象，巍然出现在热烈、昂扬的歌声中。是他，带领大寨人在冰天造大坝，在雪地移高山，用扁担挑起乱石砖，用镢头开出米粮川。独唱描绘出的这幅艰苦奋斗、自力更生的图景，给了观众强烈感染。
    上海京剧、昆剧、沪剧、越剧、滑稽剧、话剧六个不同剧种的九十多名演员，演出了气势磅礴的大联唱《歌唱王杰，学习王杰》。这个联唱由七首歌曲组成，以雄壮有力的曲调，感人地刻划了这位一不怕苦、二不怕死的伟大革命战士的光辉的一生，以及全国千百万青年在他的革命精神鼓舞下，拿起笔来大写革命日记，扛起王杰的枪要为中国革命和世界革命奋斗到底的壮丽情景。
    在一次音乐会上有这么多光辉的工农兵英雄形象，以震撼人心的力量在观众面前集中出现，开创了“上海之春”音乐会大抒无产阶级革命之情的新局面，有力地锤击了反党反社会主义黑线。
    这些歌颂英雄的节目，是上海音乐工作者遵循党和毛主席制定的文艺方向，深入工农兵斗争生活，不断改造思想感情所取得的初步成果。许多音乐工作者有这样一个共同体会：要歌唱工农兵英雄，就要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观和艺术观；要歌唱工农兵英雄，就要与工农兵结合，使自己具备工农兵的思想感情；要歌唱工农兵英雄，就要认真向工农兵英雄学习，以工农兵英雄作为自己的榜样。
    这次“英雄赞歌”专场的大联唱《歌唱王杰，学习王杰》的创作和演出的成功，就是一个雄辩的证明。这个大联唱的作者并不是什么著名的作曲家，演唱的也不是那些知名的歌唱家。它的创作者和演唱者是上海六个剧种的一些演员。去年以来他们经常带着毛主席著作，到郊区农村深入生活，同贫农下中农一起劳动，参加社会主义教育运动，逐渐地受到劳动人民思想感情的熏陶。当他们读了《王杰日记》以后，就怀着强烈的阶级感情和贫农下中农一起学习王杰。在王杰精神的鼓舞下，在较短的时间内，他们接连写出了七首歌唱王杰的歌曲。
    在创作过程中，他们反复学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，努力以农民爱听、能唱为标准，写了一稿又一稿，写成以后又和贫农下中农一起唱，根据贫农下中农意见反复修改。大联唱《歌唱王杰，学习王杰》就是在学英雄的革命感情鼓舞下，并且在广泛的群众基础上诞生的。
    这个专场的许多节目的创作和演出，都反映出：唱英雄，必须首先学英雄。当焦裕禄的光辉事迹在报上刊出以后，上海的音乐工作者立即掀起了学焦裕禄、演焦裕禄的热潮。不少单位都组织了创作和演出人员，到河南兰考县深入生活，了解和学习兰考人民在毛泽东思想指导下战胜“三害”，改变大自然面貌的革命精神。这个专场演出的歌曲《毛主席的好学生》、评弹《掏尽红心为人民》，就是在这个学习过程中写出来的。
    音乐工作者们从塑造英雄人物的要求出发，解放思想，突破束缚新内容的老框框，运用了音乐艺术的多种表现形式，并使之有了新的发展。以上事例说明，只要遵循毛泽东文艺方向前进，文艺工作者将具有多么巨大的创造力量！在文艺工作者面前的天地是何等广阔！
    客观事物发展的规律告诉我们，要发展社会主义文艺，要使工农兵英雄形象巍然屹立在舞台上，决不是一帆风顺的，决不是不要经过严重斗争就能实现的。三年前，上海青年音乐工作者开始歌唱伟大的共产主义战士雷锋的时候，曾经遭到一些资产阶级音乐“权威”人士顽固的反对，他们说什么：这种歌曲“硬梆梆、不抒情”；说什么这种歌曲“太简单、没味道，寿命不会长”。可是，革命的青年音乐工作者没有为这股妖风所动摇，他们坚定地、满腔热情地歌唱雷锋。他们说，只要工农兵喜欢的歌曲，我们就要唱。事实证明，他们这样做是完全正确的。三年来，他们在工厂、农村无数次歌唱雷锋，近年来又大唱王杰、焦裕禄等许多英雄，赞颂毛泽东时代的英雄的歌声越唱越响，受到广大工农兵听众的热烈欢迎。他们自己的革命感情也越唱越充沛。“上海之春”的“英雄赞歌”专场音乐会上，很多歌唱工农兵英雄的独唱、对唱、合唱、表演唱、大联唱和多样形式的乐器演奏，丰满地表现了英雄们的革命气概，具有很大的感染力。人们一听就说：这种歌曲有味道，使人意气风发，革命感情倍增。象歌颂雷锋的一些歌曲，在广大群众中已经流行了三年，听众们还是一再为这个节目的演出热烈鼓掌。和一些资产阶级音乐“权威”们所说的完全相反，歌唱工农兵英雄的歌曲有着无穷的生命力；寿命不长的恰恰是他们那些内容空虚、抒资产阶级之情的音乐作品。这些作品，很多音乐工作者不愿唱，广大工农兵群众更不想听。广大工农兵群众就是喜爱“英雄赞歌”这样的音乐会，他们在报纸上写文章评论说：这样的“英雄赞歌”，替我们说了话，长了革命志气，这才是我们爱听的时代歌声，这才是我们需要的社会主义音乐。
