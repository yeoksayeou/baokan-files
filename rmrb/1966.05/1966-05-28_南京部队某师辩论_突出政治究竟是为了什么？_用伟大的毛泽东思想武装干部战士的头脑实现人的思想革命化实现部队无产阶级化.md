    Nanjing Military Region某师 Debates "What Exactly is the Purpose of Highlighting Politics?"
    Using the Great Mao Zedong Thought to Arm the Minds of Cadres and Soldiers, Realizing the Ideological Revolutionization of People, and Realizing the Proletarianization of the Troops
    *Liberation Army Daily* Editor's Note: The leading organs of a certain division of the Nanjing Military Region launched a major debate on "What exactly is the purpose of highlighting politics?" Their conclusion is: Use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of all cadres and soldiers, realize the ideological revolutionization of people, and realize the proletarianization of the troops.
    Marxists should at least know that existence determines consciousness, and that spirit and matter interact. Matter acts upon spirit, and spirit reacts upon matter. Under certain conditions, spirit plays a decisive role.
    Regarding the relationship between spirit and matter, matter is primary, and spirit is secondary. This is in terms of where human thought comes from, and in terms of the order in which matter and spirit arise, not in terms of the magnitude of their power. In terms of the effect it has, sometimes the power of spirit greatly exceeds the power of matter. Matter transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into matter. Once the correct ideas representing the advanced class are grasped by the masses, they will become a powerful material force. Therefore, we must vigorously highlight politics and vigorously carry out ideological work among the people.
    At any time, in doing any work, we should pay great attention to the role of thought, great attention to the role of thought in the socialist era, and great attention to the role of the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts, the lifeblood of our lives, and the source of all our strength. With Mao Zedong Thought, people become the most selfless, the most courageous, the most intelligent, capable of doing any work well, overcoming any difficulties, and defeating any enemy. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can change the ideological face of people, change the face of the motherland, enable our people to stand up and stand up forever in front of the world; and enable the oppressed and exploited people of the world to stand up and stand up forever.
    Whether or not to highlight politics, whether or not to carry out the ideological revolutionization of people, is a matter of whether or not to engage in class struggle, a matter of adhering to revolution or not adhering to revolution, a matter of whether socialist society advances or regresses.
    We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to highlight politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Let those bourgeois "authority" gentlemen who oppose our highlighting of politics and oppose our creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works rage!
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th—What exactly is the purpose of highlighting politics? Is it simply to do a good job in business and complete a certain work task? How exactly should the relationship between politics and business be arranged? Is highlighting politics merely a "means" to ensure the completion of business and to do some work well? The leading organs of a certain division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Nanjing Military Region launched a major debate on this issue, powerfully criticizing some vague understandings and erroneous viewpoints in highlighting politics. They said: If vague understandings and erroneous viewpoints are not clarified, it will be impossible to truly highlight politics, grasp the struggle of promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois, grasp the ideological revolutionization of people, and truly use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, promote everything, and transform everything.
    This debate by the leading organs of the division was conducted during the widespread discussion of the relationship between politics and business in all walks of life. At that time, some people raised the following questions: Highlighting politics is for the sake of doing a good job in business and completing tasks; politics is "illusory," business is "real," and highlighting politics must be realized through business; thinking leads tasks, and the combination of politics and business means politics has been highlighted, and highlighted "thoroughly," and so on. What do these questions reflect, and how should they be correctly treated? The division's Party committee boldly handed these questions over to the masses, letting everyone discuss them. Through discussion, the truth became clearer with debate, and the questions became clearer with discussion. They said that this debate was well done. It concerns whether highlighting politics can be implemented, where it should be implemented, and whether the Chairman Mao's thinking and line on army building can be correctly implemented.
    The first question debated by this unit was: Is highlighting politics just for the sake of doing a good job in business and completing tasks? Many comrades said: No. They believe that the statement "highlighting politics is for the sake of doing a good job in business" is wrong and very harmful. It belittles the great strategic significance of highlighting politics. Comrade Lin Biao instructed us that whether or not to highlight politics, whether or not to carry out the ideological revolutionization of people, is a matter of whether or not to engage in class struggle, and a matter of adhering to revolution or not adhering to revolution. They believe that simply emphasizing that highlighting politics is for the sake of doing a good job in business and implementing it in business will inevitably lead people to bury themselves in business, not ask about politics, not ask about class struggle, and open the door wide for the rampant spread of revisionist thought and the restoration of capitalism. We highlight politics not only to complete a certain task, but most fundamentally, to ensure that our army is forever loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, never takes the wrong direction, and never changes color.
    Many comrades went on to say: In terms of the relationship between politics and business, the statement "highlighting politics is for the sake of doing a good job in business" is also wrong. Because it reverses the relationship between highlighting politics and doing a good job in business, which is the relationship between commander and the commanded. This statement actually regards business as the "end" and highlighting politics as a "means" to do a good job in business and complete a certain work task. Chairman Mao taught us that politics is the commander, is the soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. Therefore, politics must command everything, and all work must serve politics. This relationship must absolutely not be reversed. If this relationship is reversed, one will inevitably stare at business, only grasp technology, grasp specific tasks, weaken and impact political and ideological work, and lead to the erroneous conclusion that "completing tasks well means highlighting politics well." Everyone cited the example of individual units in 1964 that once only grasped military technology, neglected political work, and experienced "two ends sticking out," where military technology was prominent, and ideological problems were also prominent, illustrating that neglecting politics and grasping technology leads to greater harm the more prominent the technology becomes.
    How to straighten out this relationship? Everyone believes that it is necessary to truly highlight politics, highlight Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the struggle of promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois, realize the proletarianization of the troops, and realize the ideological revolutionization of people. Many comrades cited many vivid facts to illustrate that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. With such people, in the storms of class struggle, they can see clearly, stand firm, and withstand pressure, and do outstandingly in various tasks. With such people, any difficulties can be overcome, and any human miracles can be created.
    The second question they debated was: Is leading tasks with thought the same as highlighting politics and highlighting it "thoroughly"?
    In the practice of highlighting politics, many comrades tasted the sweetness and bitterness of "winning when leading tasks with thought and failing when doing tasks for the sake of tasks." In this situation, some comrades believed that simply grasping the living ideas in work is highlighting politics, as if this is the entirety of highlighting politics, and highlighting politics is considered "thorough."
    After discussion, everyone realized that: Leading tasks with thought is an important aspect of highlighting politics, but it is not the entirety of highlighting politics. Everyone believes that using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, grasping the living ideas in completing tasks, mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and completing tasks well is important. Because every job and every specific task of ours is an indispensable part of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Doing it well is adding a brick and a tile to the cause of communism. At the same time, the struggle practice of completing various tasks also has a significant effect on the ideological transformation of people. Therefore, we must adhere to leading tasks with thought in the future and strive to do it better and better. However, it must be clearly seen that simply relying on completing work tasks and grasping the living ideas in work cannot completely solve the fundamental problem of the ideological revolutionization of people and the further proletarianization of the troops. To solve this fundamental problem, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly grasp class struggle. Especially in the current situation of sharp, complex, and intense class struggle at home and abroad, it is even more necessary to deeply carry out the struggle of promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois, break private interests and establish public interests, and transform the world view. This requires not only doing regular political education but also concentrating a certain amount of time, mobilizing the masses, and carrying out large-scale political movements.
    Everyone also believes that the successful completion of a work task should not only see the role of mobilization work, propaganda and agitation work, and grasping current living ideas, but also see that it is the result of regular education fundamentally improving the class consciousness of cadres and soldiers. Some comrades gave examples, saying: Communist fighter Wang Jie unhesitatingly used his own life to protect twelve class brothers in the face of life and death choices. Steel fighter Mai Xiande insisted on fighting until victory despite suffering a serious head injury in battle. This great communist spirit and proletarian backbone spirit of theirs is by no means based on momentary enthusiasm and impulse, but is the result of their long-term creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works and their hard work in the word "use," with "wholeheartedly for the revolution, everything for the revolution," and "having the red sun in their hearts." Without the party's accumulated arduous and meticulous political and ideological education, without their own painstaking ideological transformation, without strict demands and training in actual struggles, without fundamentally improving their proletarian consciousness, and without firmly establishing the idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly, it would be impossible to achieve this. For people without proletarian consciousness, no matter how clearly the significance of completing tasks is explained, they will not show the heroic behavior of comrades Wang Jie and Mai Xiande when they need to give their lives. If it is a unit, it is still possible if the leaders grasp tightly, but it will not work if they relax a little; it is still possible to complete temporary tasks, but it may not work to continue for a long time; it is still possible in general circumstances, but it may not pass the test in the most difficult and critical circumstances. This proves that this unit has not truly highlighted politics. Many comrades concluded that: The fundamental thing is to use Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for all tasks and strive to improve the proletarian consciousness of cadres and soldiers and promote the ideological revolutionization of people.
    In the discussion, many comrades also pointed out that: Regarding leading tasks with thought as the entirety of highlighting politics, this understanding, if not clarified, will inevitably develop into highlighting tasks instead of highlighting politics. No matter what one's subjective wishes are, in practice, it will be: those related to tasks will be "highlighted," and those thought to be unrelated will not be highlighted; those that can be used will be "highlighted," and those thought to be unusable will be put aside. This approach is essentially still a purely business viewpoint divorced from politics.
    Finally, everyone said that it is very harmful to think that highlighting politics is "thorough" just by achieving "leading tasks with thought." Now, we have not highlighted politics enough, just like starting to climb Mount Everest, we are still far from the summit. It is exactly "infinite scenery is at the perilous peak," and arduous efforts are still needed.
    The third question they discussed was: Is politics "illusory" and business "real," and how to view the achievements of highlighting politics?
    After the discussion of the first two questions, everyone had made it clear that: Highlighting politics mainly means revolutionizing people's thinking. At this time, some comrades raised such a question: Ideological revolutionization is invisible and intangible. Daqing's revolutionization produced oil, and Dazhai's revolutionization produced grain. Without taking anything out, how can it be explained that it is truly revolutionized? As soon as this question was raised, a heated debate began. During the debate, everyone realized that ideological revolutionization is not "illusory," and whether it is "transformed" well or not can be seen and measured. Many comrades gave a lot of examples in their speeches, summarizing their meaning as: To see whether a person's revolutionization is good or not is to see whether he loves the Party, loves Chairman Mao, loves the socialist system, and loves Mao Zedong Thought; it is to see whether his proletarian stance is firm, and whether his love and hatred are clear; whether he can consciously implement the Party's policies; whether he serves the people completely and thoroughly, and whether personal interests unconditionally obey the interests of the Party; whether his proletarian feelings are deep, and whether he respects his superiors, loves his subordinates, and unites comrades; whether he has the spirit of daring to criticize and self-criticize; whether his revolutionary will is strong, and whether he is not afraid of hardship in peacetime and not afraid of death in wartime; whether he has noble proletarian morality; and whether he respects dialectical materialism, seeks truth from facts, and pays attention to methods, and so on. To see whether a cadre's work highlights politics, then see whether he creatively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works himself, and organizes the troops to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and works hard in the word "use," grasping the promotion of the proletarian and the elimination of the bourgeois, and constantly revolutionizing his thinking; see whether he has a clear political purpose for the part of the work he is responsible for, consciously subordinate to the politics of the proletariat; in practical work, whether he uses Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, starts with ideological work, grasps living ideas, and constantly improves people's consciousness; when encountering contradictions between business work and political work, whether he can make business obey politics, give way to politics, and actively participate in political work. Everyone said that all of the above can be seen and measured.
    Discussing this, everyone realized that the most fundamental thing about highlighting politics is to produce spiritual achievements. With spiritual achievements, material achievements will inevitably be produced. Some comrades also used Daqing and Dazhai as examples to illustrate this point. They said: Daqing produced oil, and Dazhai produced grain, first of all, it produced Daqing people like Wang Jinxi and Dazhai people like Chen Yonggui who were armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Without Daqing people like Wang Jinxi and Dazhai people like Chen Yonggui, there would never be Daqing and Dazhai today. As long as Mao Zedong Thought takes root in people's minds, Lei Feng and Wang Jie will be produced in peacetime, and Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang will be produced in wartime. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power and the greatest productivity. Any powerful enemy can be defeated, and no difficulty is insurmountable. Therefore, to see the achievements of highlighting politics, first of all, look at the spiritual achievements, and secondly, look at the material achievements. With spiritual achievements, material achievements will definitely be produced. However, the transformation from spirit to matter requires certain conditions and a process, and one must never take a negative attitude just because material achievements cannot be seen for a while. At the same time, when looking at material achievements, politics must be the first standard, and one cannot vaguely think that "more" is good; things that deviate from or impact proletarian politics, no matter how much there is, are useless, or even the more the more harmful. Finally, everyone unanimously came to this conclusion: Seeing things must see people, and seeing people must see thoughts; otherwise, it is a bourgeois viewpoint and a revisionist viewpoint.

    南京部队某师辩论“突出政治究竟是为了什么？”
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装干部战士的头脑实现人的思想革命化实现部队无产阶级化
    《解放军报》编者按：南京部队某师领导机关就“突出政治究竟是为了什么？”展开了一场大辩论。他们的结论是：用毛泽东思想武装全体干部战士的头脑，实现人的思想革命化，实现部队的无产阶级化。
    马克思主义者起码应该知道，存在决定意识，精神和物质交互作用。物质作用于精神，精神反作用于物质。在一定条件下，精神起决定的作用。
    精神和物质的关系，物质是第一性的，精神是第二性的。这是就人的思想从哪里来说的，这是就物质、精神发生先后说的，不是就力量大小说的。就发生的作用来说，有时精神的力量大大超过物质的力量。物质变精神，精神变物质。当代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成强大的物质力量。因此，我们一定要大力突出政治，大力搞好人的思想工作。
    我们在任何时候，做任何工作，都应该十分重视思想的作用，十分重视社会主义时代思想的作用，十分重视伟大的毛泽东思想的作用。
    毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，是我们的命根子，是我们一切力量的源泉。有了毛泽东思想，人就变得最无私，最勇敢，最聪明，什么工作都能做好，什么困难都能克服，什么敌人都能战胜。有了毛泽东思想，就能够改变人的思想面貌，就能够改变祖国的面貌，就能够使我国人民在全世界面前站起来，永远站起来；就能够使全世界被压迫、被剥削的人民站起来，永远站起来。
    搞不搞突出政治，搞不搞人的思想革命化，就是搞不搞阶级斗争的问题，就是坚持革命还是不坚持革命的问题，就是关系社会主义社会前进还是倒退的问题。
    我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    让那些反对我们突出政治，反对我们活学活用毛主席著作的资产阶级“权威”老爷们暴跳如雷吧！
    新华社南京二十七日电  突出政治究竟是为了什么，是单纯为了搞好业务、完成某项工作任务吗？政治与业务的关系究竟应该怎样摆法，突出政治仅仅是为了保证业务的完成，成为做好某些工作的“手段”吗？中国人民解放军南京部队某师领导机关为此展开了一场大辩论，有力地批判了在突出政治中的一些模糊认识和错误观点。他们说：模糊认识、错误观点不澄清，就不可能真正把政治突出起来，抓好兴无灭资的斗争，抓好人的思想革命化，真正用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切。
    这个师领导机关的这场辩论是在各行各业广泛讨论政治与业务关系时进行的。当时，有的人提出了这样一些问题：突出政治就是为了搞好业务、完成任务；政治是“虚”，业务是“实”，突出政治必须通过业务来实现；思想带任务、政治与业务结合，就是突出了政治、而且突出“到家”了，等等。这些问题反映了什么，应该怎样正确对待？师党委把这些问题放手大胆地交给群众，让大家讨论，经过讨论，真理越辩越明，问题越谈越清。他们说这场辩论搞得好，它关系到突出政治能不能落实，往哪落实的问题，关系到能不能正确贯彻毛主席的建军思想、建军路线的问题。
    这个部队辩论的第一个问题是：突出政治是不是就是为了搞好业务、完成任务？许多同志说：不是。他们认为，“突出政治就是为了搞好业务”的说法是错误的，也是十分有害的，它贬低了突出政治的伟大战略意义。林彪同志指示我们，搞不搞突出政治，搞不搞人的思想革命化，就是搞不搞阶级斗争的问题，就是坚持革命还是不坚持革命的问题。他们认为，单纯强调突出政治就是为了搞好业务，落实到业务上去，必然会把人们引导到埋头业务，不问政治，不问阶级斗争的邪道上去，为修正主义思想泛滥、为资本主义复辟大开方便之门。我们突出政治，不仅仅是为了完成某项任务，最根本的是，为了保证我军永远忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛泽东思想，永远不走错方向，永远不变颜色。
    许多同志接着说：就政治与业务的关系来说，“突出政治就是为了搞好业务”的说法也是错误的。因为它颠倒了突出政治与搞好业务之间的统帅与被统帅的关系。这种说法实际上是把业务当成“目的”，把突出政治看作是搞好业务、完成某项工作任务的一种“手段”。毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。因此，政治必须统帅一切，一切工作必须为政治服务，绝对不能把这个关系颠倒过来。如果颠倒了这个关系，势必两眼盯着业务，只抓技术，抓具体任务，削弱和冲击政治思想工作，引出“完成任务好，就是突出政治好”的错误结论。大家举出了一九六四年个别单位一度只抓军事技术，忽视了政治工作，出现了军事技术冒了尖，思想问题也冒了尖的“两头冒尖”的事例，说明忽视政治抓技术，技术越冒尖，危害越大。
    如何摆正这个关系，大家认为，就是要真正突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，搞兴无灭资的斗争，实现部队的无产阶级化，实现人的思想革命化。许多同志举出许多生动的事实，说明用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。有了这样的人，在阶级斗争的风浪中，看得清，站得稳，顶得住，在各项工作中干得出色。有了这样的人，什么困难都可以克服，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    他们辩论的第二个问题是：以思想带任务，是不是就是突出了政治，而且突出“到家”了？
    这个部队在突出政治的实践中，许多同志尝到了“以思想带任务则胜，为任务而任务则败”的甜头和苦头。在这种情况下，有些同志就认为，只是抓好了工作中的活思想，便是突出了政治，似乎这就是突出政治的全部了，突出政治就算是“到家”了。
    经过讨论，大家认识到：以思想带任务是突出政治的一个重要方面，但不是突出政治的全部。大家认为，以毛泽东思想为指针，抓好完成任务中的活思想，把群众的积极性、创造性调动起来，完成好任务，是重要的。因为我们的每一项工作，每一项具体任务，都是无产阶级革命事业不可缺少的一部分，把它做好了，就为共产主义事业添了一砖一瓦。同时，在完成各项任务的斗争实践中，对人的思想改造也有重大作用。因此，今后还要坚持以思想带任务，并且力求做得好上加好。但是，必须清楚地看到，单单依靠完成工作任务，抓好工作中的活思想，还不能完全解决人的思想革命化、部队更加无产阶级化这个根本问题。要解决这个根本问题，必须牢记毛主席的教导，狠抓阶级斗争。特别是在当前国内外阶级斗争尖锐、复杂、激烈的形势下，更要深入开展兴无灭资的斗争，破私立公，改造世界观。这就不仅要做好经常性的政治教育，而且还需要集中一定时间，发动群众，大搞政治运动。
    大家还认为，一件工作任务的胜利完成，不能只看到动员工作、宣传鼓动工作、以及当前的活思想抓得好这一方面的作用，更要看到是平时教育从根本上提高了干部战士阶级觉悟的结果。有的同志举例说：共产主义战士王杰，在生死抉择面前，毫不犹豫地用自己的生命保护了十二个阶级兄弟。钢铁战士麦贤得，在战斗中头部负重伤，仍坚持战斗，直至胜利。他们这种伟大的共产主义气魄和无产阶级硬骨头精神，绝不是凭一时的热情和冲动，而是他们“一心为革命，一切为革命”，“心中有了红太阳”，长期活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的结果。如果没有党的日积月累的艰苦细致的政治思想教育，没有自己刻苦的思想改造，没有在实际斗争中严格要求和锻炼自己，没有从根本上提高了无产阶级觉悟，没有牢固地树立起完全彻底地为人民服务的思想，是根本做不到的。对于没有无产阶级觉悟的人，不管是把完成任务的意义讲得多么清楚，在需要献出生命时，也不会表现出象王杰、麦贤得同志那样的英勇行为。如果是一个单位，上级领导抓得紧还可以，稍有放松就不行；完成一时一事的任务还可以，要长期地干下去就可能不行；在一般情况下还可以，在最困难、最危急的情况下就可能过不了硬。这就证明，这个单位还没有真正突出政治。许多同志得出结论说：根本的根本，是以毛主席的书作各项工作的最高指示，努力提高干部战士的无产阶级觉悟，促进人的思想革命化。
    在讨论中，许多同志还指出：把以思想带任务看作是突出政治的全部，这种认识如果不加以澄清，势必会发展到不是突出政治，而是突出任务。不管自己的主观愿望如何，做起来，就会是：与任务有关的就去“突出”，自以为无关的就不去突出；用得着的就去“突出”，自以为用不着的就靠一边。这种做法，实质上还是脱离政治的单纯业务观点。
    最后，大家说，仅仅做到了“思想带任务”，就认为突出政治“到家”了，这是十分有害的。现在，我们突出政治还不够得很，就象开始攀登珠穆朗玛峰一样，离顶峰还差得很远，正是“无限风光在险峰”，尚需作艰苦的努力。
    他们讨论的第三个问题是：政治是不是“虚”，业务是不是“实”，怎样看待突出政治的成果？
    经过前两个问题的讨论，大家已经明确：突出政治，主要是使人的思想革命化。这时，有的同志又提出了这样一个问题：思想革命化，看不见，摸不着，大庆革命化出了石油，大寨革命化出了粮食，没有东西拿出来，怎么能说明真正革命化了？这个问题一提出，就展开了热烈的争论。争论中，大家认识到：思想革命化并不是“虚”的，“化”得好不好，是可以看得见的，是可以衡量的。许多同志在发言中举了大量例子，把他们的意思概括起来是：看一个人革命化好不好，就是看他是不是热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义制度，热爱毛泽东思想；就是看他无产阶级立场站得稳不稳，爱憎分明不分明；能不能自觉地执行党的方针政策；是不是完全彻底地为人民服务，个人利益无条件服从党的利益；无产阶级感情深厚不深厚，能不能尊上爱下，团结同志；有没有勇于批评和自我批评的精神；革命意志旺盛不旺盛，是不是平时不怕苦，战时不怕死；有没有无产阶级高尚的道德品质；是不是尊重辩证唯物论，实事求是，讲究方法等等。看一个干部的工作突出了政治没有，那就看他是不是自己活学活用毛主席著作，又组织部队活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，抓了兴无灭资，思想不断革命化；看他对他所担负的那部分工作，是不是有明确的政治目的，自觉地从属于无产阶级的政治；在实际工作中，是不是以毛泽东思想为指针，从思想工作入手，抓好活思想，不断提高人的觉悟；遇到业务工作与政治工作的矛盾，能不能业务服从政治，为政治让路，并且积极参加政治工作。大家说，以上这些，都是可以看得见，可以衡量的。
    讨论到这里，大家认识到，突出政治最根本的是出精神成果，有了精神成果必然会出物质成果。有的同志也以大庆、大寨为例来说明这个问题。他们说：大庆出石油，大寨出粮食，首先是出了用毛泽东思想武装起来的王进喜式的大庆人，陈永贵式的大寨人，如果没有王进喜式的大庆人，没有陈永贵式的大寨人，就绝不会有今天的大庆和大寨。只要是毛泽东思想在人们的头脑里扎了根，平时就出雷锋、王杰，战时就出董存瑞、黄继光。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力，是最大的生产力，任何强大的敌人都可以被打败，没有什么困难是不可克服的。因此，看突出政治的成果，首先要看精神成果，其次才是看物质成果。有了精神成果，一定会出物质成果。但是从精神到物质的转化，需要有一定的条件和过程，绝不能因为一时还看不到物质成果，就采取否定的态度。同时，在看物质成果时，必须以政治作为第一标准，不能笼笼统统地认为“多”就是好；离开了或者冲击了无产阶级政治的东西，再多也没有用，甚至是越多越有害。最后，大家一致得出了这样一个结论：见物必须见人，见人必须见思想，否则，就是资产阶级的观点，修正主义的观点。
