    Breaking Down Superstition, Shattering the Monopoly of Scientific Knowledge by a Few Intellectuals
    Mass Scientific Experiment Movement Flourishes in Rural Areas
    The abundant facts provided by the National Rural Mass Scientific Experiment Movement Experience Exchange Conference show that socialist agricultural scientific experiments must be based on the broad masses of farmers, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, in order to create a solid path for the development of socialist agriculture science.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th - The National Rural Mass Scientific Experiment Movement Experience Exchange Conference was recently held in Fuzhou. Nantong Commune in Minhou County, Fujian Province, was the key on-site location visited by the conference. The conference showed that a new era has begun in our country where the broad masses of farmers, under the brilliant light of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, directly grasp science and philosophy. A mass scientific experiment movement, taking class struggle as the key link and production struggle as the center, is vigorously unfolding in our rural areas.
    This conference was convened by the Science and Technology Association of the People's Republic of China. More than 600 representatives attended the conference, coming from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, including 14 ethnic groups. Tibetan farmer representatives who came from the Tibetan Plateau to the coast of the Min River received a particularly warm welcome from the conference representatives. Farmers were the largest group among the representatives, being the representatives and advanced figures from advanced rural scientific experiment units in various places; followed by science and technology personnel who have long been stationed at the grassroots level, enthusiastically serving farmers, and carrying out scientific experiments with the masses; and then rural party and government leading cadres at all levels who actively lead the mass scientific experiment movement; and also leading cadres from science departments at all levels across the country. This is the first time that these four groups of people have gathered together to exchange experiences and discuss the development of the rural scientific experiment movement in our country.
    The rich and colorful facts provided by the conference show that a new upsurge in the mass scientific experiment movement in our rural areas is rapidly forming and developing. According to very incomplete statistics from relevant departments in the third quarter of 1965, there were more than one million mass scientific experiment groups in rural areas across the country, with six to seven million members participating in these groups. Judging from some typical materials reflected at this conference, the number of rural scientific experiment groups is much larger than this number. More importantly, under the guidance of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment proposed by Chairman Mao, the broad masses of farmers have also conducted a wide range of diverse scientific experiment activities even without formally forming scientific experiment groups. The content of their scientific experiments covers all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. The widespread development of the rural mass scientific experiment movement has played and is playing an increasingly significant role in promoting agricultural production and the development of agricultural science, improving the scientific and technological level of the masses, and changing people's spiritual outlook.
  New-Type Farmers Combining Physical and Mental Labor
    In the rural mass scientific experiment movement, a group of new-type farmers combining physical and mental labor has emerged. In addition to the older generation of model figures who have long been famous throughout the country, such as Chen Yonggui, Chen Yongkang, Cui Zhusong, and Lu Cai, there are also many new advanced figures such as Wang Maoyu, Deng Yantang, Nie Shaojun, Liu Changyin, Li Zaigen, Song Ximing, Zhang Huanying, and Xi Ruihua. They not only apply and develop the traditional agricultural production technology and experience of farmers in our country, but also learn and master many modern agricultural science and technologies; they are not only active members in the agricultural scientific experiment movement, but also active members in class struggle and production struggle. They creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, have a firm political direction, contribute their wisdom and strength to building a new socialist countryside, and become outstanding representatives of the new socialist farmers in our country. Some of them have already begun to master dialectical materialism, the most scientific weapon, to guide their scientific practice and production practice. Chen Yongkang's "How I Carry Out Revolution in the Second Half of My Life," Guangdong's Deng Yantang's "Ten Years of Breeding," Zhejiang's Hu Xiangquan's "Using Dialectics to Farm," and Heilongjiang's Li Zaigen's "Preventing Rice Blast" and other discourses demonstrate a relatively high political level, scientific level, and philosophical level. These reports gave great enlightenment to the representatives attending the conference.
    In the mass scientific experiment movement, a large number of scientific and technological personnel in our country actively responded to the Party's call, went to the mountains and the countryside, went to the front line of agricultural production to stay for a long time, and carried out scientific experiment work with the masses according to the needs of agricultural production, and a few of them have settled in the countryside. They put down their airs, went deep into reality, went deep into the masses, humbly learned from the masses, and summarized the production practice experience of farmers, and achieved significant achievements in scientific research. Attending this conference were: Wang Shouchun, associate researcher of the Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wang Shizhi, assistant researcher of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and others. They are determined to transform their subjective world in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, take farmers as their teachers, combine with farmers, personally participate in production practice, and summarize the experience of the masses, setting a good example for scientific and technological personnel.
    Scientific Experiment Must Take Mao Zedong Thought as the Guiding Principle
    The facts of many advanced figures show that to achieve success in the scientific experiment movement, the fundamental issue lies in highlighting politics, taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and making the mass scientific experiment movement a mass movement for studying Chairman Mao's works from beginning to end. To highlight politics, we must take class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, otherwise it will lose its soul and become disoriented. Scientific experiments must serve class struggle and production struggle. In this way, scientific experiments can promote production, be conducive to consolidating the achievements of class struggle, and help the broad masses of farmers break down superstitions, get rid of blindness in production, and become masters of nature, thereby fundamentally breaking the monopoly of scientific knowledge by a few intellectuals. This will also help to avoid bureaucratism, avoid revisionism and dogmatism, and help to gradually reduce the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and physical labor. Many typical experiences introduced at the conference proved that in areas and units that earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, take class struggle as the key link, and grasp the three major revolutions simultaneously, their scientific experiment activities are carried out well, the ideological awareness and enthusiasm of the masses are improved quickly, and the appearance of production changes quickly.
        Nantong Commune, Minhou County —
    An Example of Rural Mass Scientific Experiment Movement
    All the representatives attending the conference focused on investigating the achievements and experience of the scientific experiment movement in Nantong Commune, Minhou County, Fujian Province, and unanimously agreed that it was a model of the rural mass scientific experiment movement. The cadres and members of this commune at all levels read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, took class struggle as the key link, and grasped the three major revolutionary movements simultaneously. In three years, they fundamentally changed the production outlook of a very backward commune. Nantong Commune is located on the banks of the Wulong River. Before liberation, it was a place where water and drought disasters occurred frequently and production was very backward. After liberation, with the development of the collective economy, basic construction such as flood control dams was built, and production gradually increased. During the three years of natural disasters, production dropped sharply again. Since 1962, the Party Committee of this commune has organized all the members and cadres to earnestly study Chairman Mao's instructions on carrying out the three major revolutionary movements, launched a mass debate, and discussed "Whether Nantong should change or not? Can it change? How to change?" Through this debate, the past production experience was democratically summarized, so that all members and cadres further realized that to speed up the production rate and catch up with advanced areas, it is necessary to vigorously grasp scientific experiments while vigorously grasping class struggle and production struggle. Therefore, the commune Party Committee Secretary took the lead in staying in the production team to engage in model fields, and organized personnel from various units and departments of the commune to participate in the scientific experiment movement. The production brigades and production teams also gradually established scientific experiment groups, summarized mass experience in production, promoted new technologies, and relied on the masses to create a variety of literary and art forms to widely publicize scientific knowledge. Now, more than 1,500 people in this commune participate in scientific experiment groups in the production teams, more than 300 people participate in the brigade scientific experiment central group in the brigades, and there are 28 scientific experiment pacesetters in the whole commune, including veteran farmers, young people, and women, with backbones at all levels and typical examples in everything. The commune has a Science and Technology Association Committee, under which there are seven professional study groups: agriculture, fruit trees, aquatic products, animal husbandry, physics and chemistry, forestry, and medicine. The members of the Commune Science Association Committee and the members of each study group are basically farmers. Farmers are in charge and make decisions on the entire scientific experiment front of the commune, and their enthusiasm and creativity are unprecedentedly high. Relying on their own strength, they have solved more than 20 key technical problems in production in three years. Such as the selection and promotion of improved varieties, the implementation of close planting and continuous cropping of rice, the creation of double-layered wet seedling beds (to prevent seedling rot), the transformation of ferrous sulfate soil, the control of rice stem borers and root rot disease that seriously harms citrus trees, artificial incubation of fish fry, etc., which promoted the vigorous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery in the whole commune. The total grain production of the commune has increased from more than 400 jin per mu in 1962 to more than 1,100 jin.
    Another major feature of the scientific experiment movement in Nantong Commune is that the various departments under the commune, such as the supply and marketing cooperative, hospitals, grain stations, agricultural middle schools, and handicraft cooperatives, have carried out a large number of scientific experiment activities around agriculture. The scientific experiment of the supply and marketing cooperative is the most prominent. In order to sell chemical fertilizers, they conducted a soil survey with the farmers and mastered the soil archives of the entire commune. They have their own soil testing equipment and personnel. In order to sell pesticides, they combined with scientific experiment groups to carry out pest and disease prediction and forecasting. In order to help farmers develop sideline businesses and increase the income of members, they advocated the development of straw mushrooms; it was not easy for farmers to make bacterial cultures, so they made them themselves. Without modern equipment, they used indigenous methods, and after dozens of failures, they finally succeeded. In order to help farmers improve work efficiency, they made improved agricultural tools such as rice planting ropes themselves. In short, they did whatever was needed in agricultural production. It can be said that this supply and marketing cooperative is a comprehensive research institute, or it can be said to be a comprehensive technical service station. All the representatives attending the conference gave a high evaluation of the Nantong Supply and Marketing Cooperative.
    Another major feature of the Nantong Commune's scientific experiment is the popular science literary and art activities written, directed, and performed by farmers themselves throughout the commune. They put their own scientific experiment struggles on the stage in a variety of literary and art forms that the masses love to see and hear. It has opened up a broad road for the combination of science and art. These propaganda forms are very vivid, very popular, and very profound, and have played a good role in popularizing the current urgently needed production technologies.
        Resolutely Criticize the Bourgeois Ideology
    That Does Not Believe That Farmers Can Run Science
    The conference emphasized that the rural mass scientific experiment movement is a combination of popularization and improvement, a combination of experimentation, demonstration, and promotion, and a combination of science and education. It is a broad technical reform movement and a great mass revolutionary movement. The process of farmers participating in the scientific experiment activities is a process of gradually developing from low to high, a process of "practice - knowledge - re-practice - re-knowledge." Therefore, the process of scientific experiment cannot be mechanically separated, and the scientific experiment activities of farmers cannot be limited to a narrow range, nor can scientific experiments be carried out only by a few people. It is necessary to mobilize the enthusiasm of 500 million farmers so that hundreds of millions of farmers with rich production practice experience can participate in this movement. The key issue here is to correctly understand the position and role of the farmers in the rural scientific experiment movement. The conference believes that under the socialist system, under the leadership of the Party, and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, socialist agricultural scientific experiments must be based on the broad masses of farmers, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force. Only by clearly establishing this basic ideology can we change the current situation in some areas where the leadership is behind the masses and the ideology is behind the reality, and promote the scientific experiment movement to move forward in higher and higher waves; can we develop and improve our country's agricultural science more quickly and create a solid road for the development of socialist agricultural science. At the conference, the representatives strongly criticized the bourgeois ideology that only believes that a few scientific and technological personnel can run science, and does not believe that farmers can run science. Many representatives from rural grassroots units powerfully demonstrated with vivid facts and rich scientific experiment results that farmers are fully capable of mastering science, and farmers' experience is a treasure house of science. Scientific and technological personnel play an extremely important role in the rural mass scientific experiment movement, but only by striving to transform their worldview, sincerely combining with farmers, engaging in science for the revolution together with farmers, farming for the revolution, farming scientifically, participating in production practice, and summarizing the practical experience of the masses can they make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress.
    The conference requested cadres engaged in the organization of rural mass scientific experiments to earnestly creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, go to the countryside to stay at selected spots, implement the "three togethers," summarize typical experiences to guide the general. Only in this way can they be good advisors and assistants to the local party and government leading organs. At present, the key is to strengthen the leadership of counties and communes over the scientific experiment movement, and guide the activities of grassroots scientific experiment groups. Consolidate the existing scientific experiment groups, and for places where scientific experiment groups have not yet been established, use typical demonstration methods to enlighten the masses to consciously and voluntarily gradually organize scientific experiment groups, vigorously carry out the movement of comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, so that one point can lead to many points, and many points can lead to the overall situation, and promote the mass agricultural science experiment movement to develop more widely and deeply.
    This conference adopted a revolutionary method of holding meetings, acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's epistemology, first organized the representatives to focus on investigating the Nantong Commune, which had achieved great achievements in scientific experiments, and visited the Chengguan Commune of Minhou County, where farmer breeder Wang Maoyu and farmer rice cultivation expert Huang Baoluo were located, and the national Dazhai-style agricultural typical unit, the Yinxi Brigade of Yinxi Commune in Fuqing County. Everyone watched and discussed, gradually raising perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, and then organized typical figures from all aspects to speak at the conference, so the meeting was lively and effective, and the representatives were greatly enlightened after visiting and listening to the speeches at the conference. It played a great role in solving ideological understanding problems. Everyone said that they would go back to promote the experience of Nantong Commune and quickly change the face of poverty and blankness. The representatives were greatly inspired by the understanding and experience of Chen Yongkang, Deng Yantang, Li Zaigen, Hu Xiangquan, etc. in studying Chairman Mao's works, using materialist dialectics, mastering the laws of nature, and solving key production problems, and they found gaps with them and unanimously expressed that they would learn from them, and that they would, like them, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, and contribute all their wisdom and strength to socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    At the meeting, the National Science Association awarded certificates of merit to 271 advanced units that have made remarkable achievements in the mass scientific experiment movement.

    破除迷信，打破少数知识分子对科学知识的垄断
    农村群众性科学实验运动蓬勃开展
    全国农村群众科学实验运动经验交流会议提供的丰富事实表明：社会主义的农业科学实验，必须以广大农民为主体，以贫农下中农为主力军，才能开创一条坚实的社会主义农业科学的发展道路。
    新华社福州七日电　全国农村群众科学实验运动经验交流会议最近在福州举行。福建省闽侯县南通公社是这次会议重点参观的现场。会议显示：我国广大农民，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗光辉照耀下，直接掌握科学和哲学的新时代已经开始了，一个以阶级斗争为纲，以生产斗争为中心，群众性的科学实验运动，正在我国农村中蓬勃展开。
    这次会议是由中华人民共和国科学技术协会召开的。出席这次会议的有六百多名代表，他们来自全国各省、市、自治区，包括十四个民族。从西藏高原来到闽海之滨的藏族农民代表，受到大会代表们特别热烈欢迎。代表中以农民为最多，他们是各地农村科学实验先进单位的代表和先进人物；其次是长期在基层蹲点、热心为农民服务，和群众一道开展科学实验活动的科学技术人员；再其次是积极领导群众科学实验运动的农村各级党政领导干部；还有全国各地各级科学部门的领导干部。这四方面的人同聚一堂交流经验，讨论我国农村科学实验运动的发展问题，还是第一次。
    会议提供的丰富多采的事实表明，我国农村群众科学实验运动的新高潮，正在迅速形成和发展。据有关部门一九六五年第三季度极不完全统计，全国农村群众科学实验小组有一百多万个，参加这些小组的成员有六七百万人。从这次会议所反映的一些典型材料看来，农村科学实验小组要比这个数目大得多。更重要的是广大农民在毛主席提出的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命思想指导下，在没有正式组成科学实验小组的情形下，也进行了广泛的多种多样的科学实验活动。他们从事的科学实验内容，遍及农、林、牧、副、渔和八字宪法的各个方面。农村群众性科学实验运动的广泛开展，对促进农业生产和农业科学的发展，提高群众的科学技术水平，改变人们的精神面貌，都发挥了而且正在发挥日益显著的作用。
  体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的新型农民
    在农村群众性科学实验运动中，涌现了一批体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合的新型农民。除久已闻名全国的陈永贵、陈永康、崔竹松、陆财等老一辈的模范人物外，还有王茂玉、邓炎棠、聂绍钧、柳昌银、李在根、宋喜明、张焕英、席瑞华等许多新的先进人物。他们不仅运用和发展了我国农民中的传统农业生产技术经验，同时学习和掌握许多现代农业科学技术；他们不仅是农业科学实验运动中的积极分子，也是阶级斗争和生产斗争中的积极分子。他们活学活用毛主席著作，有坚定的政治方向，在建设社会主义新农村中，贡献自己的智慧和力量，成为我国社会主义新型农民的优秀代表。他们之中有些人已经开始掌握了辩证唯物论这个最科学的武器来指导自己的科学实践和生产实践。陈永康的《我在后半辈子怎样干革命》、广东邓炎棠的《育种十年》、浙江胡香泉的《用辩证法种田》、黑龙江李在根的《防止稻瘟病》等论述，表现了相当高的政治水平、科学水平和哲学水平。这些报告，给到会的代表很大的启示。
    在群众科学实验运动中，我国大批科学技术人员，积极响应党的号召，上山下乡，到农业生产第一线去长期蹲点，根据农业生产的需要，和群众一道开展科学实验工作，其中有少数人已在农村安家落户。他们放下架子，深入实际，深入群众，虚心向群众学习，总结农民的生产实践经验，在科学研究上获得了显著成绩。出席这次会议的有：中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所副研究员王守纯、中国科学院植物研究所助理研究员王世之等。他们决心按照毛主席的教导，改造自己的主观世界，拜农民为师，同农民结合，亲自参加生产实践，总结群众经验，给科学技术人员树立了良好的榜样。
    科学实验必须以毛泽东思想为统帅
    许多先进人物的事实说明，要在科学实验运动
  中作出成绩，根本的问题在于突出政治，以毛泽东思想为统帅，使群众性科学实验运动，从始至终成为大学主席著作的群众运动。要突出政治，就必须以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，否则就失去灵魂，就会迷失方向。科学实验必须为阶级斗争和生产斗争服务，这样，科学实验才能促进生产，有利于巩固阶级斗争的成果，才能帮助广大农民破除迷信，摆脱生产盲目性，成为大自然的主人，从而从根本上打破少数知识分子对科学知识的垄断。这样也就有助于免除官僚主义，避免修正主义和教条主义，有助于逐渐缩小城乡、工农、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。会议上介绍的许多典型经验证明，凡是认真执行毛主席的指示，以阶级斗争为纲，三大革命一齐抓的地区和单位，他们的科学实验活动就开展得好，群众思想觉悟和积极性就提高得快，生产面貌就变得快。
        闽侯县南通公社——农村群众
    科学实验运动的范例
    参加会议的全体代表，曾重点考察了福建省闽侯县南通公社的科学实验运动的成就和经验，一致认为是一个农村群众科学实验运动的典范。这个公社的各级干部和社员，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，以阶级斗争为纲，三大革命运动一齐抓，在三年内使一个很落后的公社从根本上改变了生产面貌。南通公社地处乌龙江边，解放前是个水旱灾害频繁、生产十分落后的地方。解放后，随着集体经济的发展，修了防洪堤等基本建设，生产逐步提高。三年自然灾害时期，生产又大幅度下降。一九六二年以来，这个公社的党委组织全体社员、干部，认真学习毛主席关于开展三大革命运动的指示，开展全民大辩论，讨论“南通要变不要变？能不能变？怎么变？”经过这次辩论，民主总结了过去的生产经验，使全体社员干部进一步认识到，要加快生产速度，赶上先进地区，必须在大抓阶级斗争和生产斗争的同时，大抓科学实验。于是，公社党委书记带头到生产队蹲点搞样板田，并组织公社各单位、各部门的人员参加科学实验运动，各生产大队、生产队也逐步建立科学实验小组，在生产上总结群众经验，推行新技术，并依靠群众创造了多种文艺形式广泛宣传科学知识。现在，这个公社在生产队共有一千五百多人参加科学实验小组，在大队有三百多人参加大队科学实验中心小组，全公社有二十八个科学实验的标兵，有老农、有青年、有妇女，层层有骨干，样样有典型。公社有科学技术协会委员会，下设农业、果树、水产、畜牧、理化、林业、医学等七个专业学组。公社科协委员和各学组的成员，基本上都是农民。农民在整个公社的科学实验战线上当了家，作了主，积极性和创造性空前高涨。他们依靠自己的力量，三年中解决了二十多项生产关键技术问题。如选育和推广了良种，实行了水稻密植、连作，创造了双层楼湿润秧田（防止烂秧的），改造了磺酸田，治服了水稻螟害和严重危害柑桔树的烂根病，人工孵化鱼苗等等，促进了全社农林牧副渔各业生产蓬勃发展。全公社粮食生产已从一九六二年的亩产四百多斤提高到一千一百多斤。
    南通公社科学实验运动另一个大特点，是公社所属的各部门如供销社、医院、粮站、农业中学、手工业合作社等，都围绕农业作了大量的科学实验活动。供销社的科学实验最为突出。他们为了卖化肥，和农民一道搞了土壤普查，掌握了全公社的土壤档案，自己有土壤化验的设备和人员。为了卖农药，他们结合科学实验小组搞病虫害预测预报。为了帮助农民发展副业，增加社员收入，他们提倡发展草菇；农民不容易制菌苗，他们就自己制。没有现代化的设备，他们就土法上马，经过几十次的失败，终于成功。为了帮助农民提高工效，他们就自己制造插秧绳等改良农具。总之，农业生产上需要什么，他们就想方设法干什么。可以说这个供销社是一个综合研究所，也可以说是一个综合技术服务站。参加这次会议的全体代表对南通供销社给予高度评价。
    南通公社科学实验再一个大特点，是流行全公社的农民自编自演的科普文艺活动。他们以群众喜见乐闻的多种文艺形式，把他们自己的科学实验斗争搬上了舞台。为科学和文艺的结合，开辟了广阔的道路。这些宣传形式非常生动，非常通俗，非常深刻，对普及当前急需的生产技术起了良好的作用。
        坚决批判那种不相信农民能办
    科学的资产阶级思想
    会议强调指出，农村群众科学实验运动，是普及和提高相结合，试验、示范、推广相结合，科学和教育相结合，是广义的技术改革运动，是一项伟大的群众性的革命运动。农民群众在科学实验的活动过程是由低级向高级逐步发展的过程，是“实践——认识——再实践——再认识”的过程。因此，不能把科学实验的过程机械地割裂开来，不能把农民群众的科学实验活动局限在狭窄的范围内，也不能只靠少数人搞科学实验，必须调动五亿农民的积极性，使亿万有丰富生产实践经验的农民，都来参加这个运动。这里的关键问题是要正确认识农民群众在农村科学实验运动中的地位和作用。会议认为，在社会主义制度下，在党的领导下，在毛泽东思想哺育下，社会主义的农业科学实验，必须以广大农民为主体，以贫农下中农为主力军。只有明确树立这个基本思想，才能改变目前有些地区领导落后于群众，思想落后于实际的状况，促进科学实验运动一浪高一浪地前进；才能更加迅速地发展和提高我国的农业科学，开创一条坚实的社会主义农业科学的发展道路。会议上，代表们对只相信少数科学技术人员能够办科学，不相信农民群众能够办科学的资产阶级思想，作了有力批判。许多来自农村基层单位的代表，用生动的事实和丰富的科学实验成果，有力地说明，农民是完全可以掌握科学的，农民经验是科学的宝库。科学技术人员在农村群众科学实验运动中，有极其重要的作用，但他们只有努力进行世界观的改造，真诚地同农民相结合，同农民一起为革命办科学，为革命种田，用科学种田，参加生产实践，总结群众的实践经验，才能有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。
    会议要求从事农村群众科学实验组织工作的干部，要认真活学活用毛主席著作，下乡蹲点，实行“三同”，总结典型经验，以指导一般。只有这样才能当好当地党政领导机关的参谋和助手。目前关键是加强县和公社对科学实验运动的领导，指导基层科学实验小组的活动。对已有的科学实验小组作好巩固工作，对还没有建立科学实验小组的地方，要用典型示范的办法，启发群众自觉自愿的逐步组织科学实验小组，大力开展比学赶帮超运动，以便一点带多点，多点带全面，推动群众农业科学实验运动更加广泛、深入的开展。
    这次会议，采取革命化的开会方法，按照毛主席认识论办事，首先组织代表重点考察了在科学实验中取得重大成就的南通公社，参观了农民育种家王茂玉、农民水稻栽培专家黄宝洛所在的闽侯县城门公社和全国大寨式农业典型单位——福清县音西公社音西大队，大家边看边议，把感性的认识逐步提高到理性认识，然后又组织各方面的典型人物在大会上发言，因而会议开的生动活泼，效果很好，代表们在参观和听取大会发言之后，受到很大启示。对解决思想认识问题，起了很大作用。大家纷纷表示回去要推广南通公社的经验，迅速改变一穷二白的面貌。代表们从陈永康、邓炎棠、李在根、胡香泉等学习毛主席著作，运用唯物辩证法，掌握自然规律，解决生产关键问题的体会和经验中，得到很大启发，纷纷和他们找差距，一致表示要好好向他们学习，要象他们一样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗突出政治，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设，贡献自己全部的智慧和力量。
    会上，全国科协给二百七十一个在群众科学实验运动中作出显著成绩的先进单位发了奖状。
