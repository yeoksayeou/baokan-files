    Pick Up the Pen to Break the Black Line
    Armored Corps of a certain unit　Ma Guimin
    For more than ten years, the bourgeoisie, revisionists, and so-called monsters and demons of the 1930s literature and art circles have constituted a black line against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. They blatantly opposed Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, advocated class reconciliation, spread bourgeois ideological toxins, and served as vanguards for the restoration of capitalism in China. They attempted to transform our younger generation into successors of the bourgeoisie. Faced with the rampant attacks of bourgeois artists and writers, I was so angry that I clenched my rifle so hard it "squeaked". I have a bellyful of things to say, and I really want to tell our beloved Party, our beloved Chairman Mao, and hundreds of millions of class brothers. A strong sense of revolutionary responsibility prompted me to pick up the pen, to deflate the arrogance of the class enemy and boost the morale of our proletariat.
    Those bourgeois literary critics slander our workers, peasants, and soldiers' articles as "small stamps" and "tofu squares," unworthy of being published in "elegant halls." We must solemnly tell them: your articles are long, yes long, big, yes big, but they are nothing more than the long and smelly foot bindings of the bourgeoisie. You stand on the position of the bourgeoisie, acting as apologists for the reactionary class, so your "huge articles" are bound to be small. Not only small, but also reactionary. We are revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the firmest stance and the clearest love and hate. Our articles are short, but every word comes from the bottom of our hearts, every sentence praises the Party, praises socialism, and praises the great Mao Zedong Thought. Our "small stamps" and "tofu squares" are not necessarily small.
    We will turn these "small stamps" and "tofu squares" into daggers and hand grenades to destroy your reactionary "black line" fortresses. We will hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in literature and art, thoroughly eradicate the reactionary literary and artistic black line of the bourgeoisie and revisionism, and eliminate it completely and thoroughly until the very end! The elegant halls of socialist culture will absolutely not allow you to occupy them, absolutely not allow you to monopolize them. It is our workers, peasants, and soldiers' time to enter the elegant halls of socialist culture and be the masters!

    拿起笔杆破黑线
    某部装甲兵　马贵民
    十多年来，文艺界的资产阶级、修正主义和所谓三十年代文艺的牛鬼蛇神，构成了一条反党、反社会主义、反对毛泽东思想的黑线。他们明目张胆地与毛泽东文艺思想唱反调，提倡阶级调和，散布资产阶级思想毒素，给资本主义在中国复辟当开路先锋。他们企图使我国年青的一代，都蜕化成资产阶级的接班人。面对着资产阶级文艺家的猖狂进攻，我气愤得把枪杆都攥的“吱吱”响，我有满腹心里话，真想一口气告诉给敬爱的党、敬爱的毛主席和亿万的阶级弟兄。一种强烈的革命责任感，促使我拿起笔杆，去灭阶级敌人的威风，长我们无产阶级的志气。
    那些资产阶级的文艺批评家，诬蔑我们工农兵的文章是“小邮票”、“豆腐块”，不能登“大雅之堂”。我们必须正告他们：你们的文章长是长，大是大，但不过是又长又臭的资产阶级的裹脚布。你们站在资产阶级的立场上，为反动阶级充当辩护士，你们的“巨文”就必然渺小。不仅渺小，而且反动。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，我们的文章短，但字字都是从心坎里发出的，句句都是歌颂党歌颂社会主义歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想的，我们的“小邮票”“豆腐块”未必渺小。
    我们就是要把“小邮票”、“豆腐块”，当成匕首和手榴弹，摧毁你们反动的“黑线”堡垒。我们要高举毛泽东思想的文艺红旗，彻底铲除资产阶级和修正主义的反动文艺黑线，直至最后干净彻底地把它消灭！社会主义文化的大雅之堂决不允许你们占领，决不允许你们垄断，是我们工农兵登社会主义文化的大雅之堂，当家作主的时候了！
