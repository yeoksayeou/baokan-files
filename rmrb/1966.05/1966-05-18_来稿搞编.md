    In 1950, during the Korean War, we once went to clean up the battlefield. We only paid attention to checking the materials on the enemy's vehicles and did not notice that there was an American devil hiding under the car, pretending to be dead. This American devil took advantage of our carelessness and suddenly turned around and fired a cold shot at us. Fortunately, the comrade next to me discovered him and caught him on the spot. Now, aren't those hidden enemies in "Three-Family Village" who don't carry guns also trying to pretend to be dead behind *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily*? Comrades, be vigilant! Beware of these conspirators also "suddenly turning around and firing cold shots at us"!

    The "Three-Family Village" black shop is actually a branch of the "Three Ni" black company jointly operated by N.S. Khrushchev, Kennedy, and Nehru. Every item in the shop is labeled with the "Three Ni Company" trademark and is wholesale from there. The "Three Ni Company" slandered our Great Leap Forward as an "adventurous plan," and the "Three-Family Village" cursed the Great Leap Forward as "boasting" and "talking big." The "Three Ni Company" slandered Chairman Mao's scientific thesis that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" as "dogmatic theory," and the "Three-Family Village" cursed it as "great empty talk,"... In short, whatever the black company sells, the black shop also sells. Whenever the black company needs to sell something, the black shop also sells it at the same time. Now that the black company is finished, can its branch's life be long?

    Deng Tuo said viciously: "Ten years to forge a sword, its frosty edge yet untested." He took this "sword" to rebel. However, this "sword" had the opposite effect as the foreign guns and cannons in Chiang Kai-shek's hands. In the past, Chiang Kai-shek launched an offensive against the people with foreign guns and cannons, but instead raised the Chinese people's political vigilance and combat effectiveness. Today, Deng Tuo and his gang of enemies who don't carry guns attack the Party and socialism, making us even more clear-eyed and aware of the complex situation of class struggle. Therefore, Deng Tuo's "sword" is not only a big poisonous weed but also the best negative example.
                Wei Zhiqun, Cadre of the Hefei Municipal People's Armed Forces Department

    According to Deng Tuo's explanation, "benevolent rule" (王道 wangdao) is "the ideological style of the mass line, honestly starting from practical work," and in ancient times some people "agreed with benevolent rule and did not agree with hegemonic rule." This is utter nonsense! The exploiting classes, who rely on drinking people's blood to maintain their rule, have always only talked about "hegemonic rule" (霸道badao) to the people and could not possibly talk about any "benevolent rule." If there is any, it is the "benevolent rule" of the "paradise of benevolent rule" (王道乐土 wangdao letu) that the Japanese devils promoted when they invaded our country, with the "three alls policy" (三光政策 sanguang zhengce) as its main content. Our people have already experienced enough of this kind of "benevolent rule." No matter how eloquently Deng Tuo speaks, we will never let history repeat itself.

    一九五○年在朝鲜战场上的时候，有一次我们去打扫战场，只注意查点敌人汽车上的物资，没有留意汽车底下还藏着一个装死的美国鬼子。这个美国鬼子趁我们不防的时候，突然翻转身来向我们放冷枪。幸亏边上的同志发现，当场把他抓住了。现在，“三家村”那些不拿枪的暗藏敌人，不是也想躲在《前线》《北京日报》的后面装死么？同志们，警惕呵，当心这些阴谋家也“突然翻转身来向我们放冷枪”！			解放军某部　侯学纯
    “三家村”黑店，实际上是尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、肯尼迪、尼赫鲁合伙经营的“三尼”黑公司的分店，店里的货色件件都贴着“三尼公司”的商标，都是从那里批发来的。“三尼公司”诬蔑我们的大跃进是“冒险的计划”，“三家村”就咒骂大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”。“三尼公司”诬蔑毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是“教条主义理论”，“三家村”就咒骂是“伟大的空话”，……总之，黑公司里卖什么，黑店里也就卖什么，黑公司需要什么时候卖，黑店也就在什么时候卖。现在黑公司已经完蛋了，它的分店的寿命难道还能长么？

    邓拓恶狠狠地说：“十年磨一剑，霜刃未曾试”，他拿了这把“剑”想造反。但是，这把“剑”跟蒋介石手中的洋枪洋炮一样起了相反的作用。过去蒋介石用洋枪洋炮向人民发动进攻，反而提高了中国人民的政治警惕和战斗力；今天邓拓等一伙不拿枪的敌人向党向社会主义进攻，使我们更加擦亮了眼睛，认清了阶级斗争的复杂形势。所以，邓拓的“剑”既是大毒草，也是最好的反面教材。

    根据邓拓的解释，“王道”就是“老老实实的从实际工作出发的群众路线的思想作风”，而且古代就有人“赞成王道，而不赞成霸道的”。这是十足的蠢话！依靠喝人血维持统治的剥削阶级，对人民从来是只讲“霸道”，不可能讲什么“王道”的，要有，那就是日本鬼子侵略我国的时候宣传的“王道乐土”的“王道”，以“三光政策”为主要内容的“王道”。这种“王道”，我国人民已经领教够了。不管邓拓怎样花言巧语，我们再也不会让历史重演。
