    Overthrow the Cow Demons and Snake Spirits, Defend the Leadership of the Party
    Now that Deng Tuo and a handful of cow demons and snake spirits have emerged, we will resolutely overthrow them; since the big poisonous weeds of "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Notes from Three-Family Village" have appeared, we will eradicate them from the roots.
    One of the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain, Ge Zhenlin
    Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, a handful of cow demons and snake spirits, have all been dragged out. From Deng Tuo's black talk, we can see at a glance that he is a ringleader among this handful of cow demons and snake spirits, a deeply buried anti-Party and anti-socialist time bomb within the revolutionary ranks.
    Deng Tuo, harboring deep hatred for the Party, has been throwing out his "Yanshan Night Talks" since 1961, launching vicious and comprehensive attacks on our great Party, denouncing our Party as "fanatical," "having a fever," speaking "grandiose empty words," and suffering from "amnesia." This is truly arrogance to the extreme!
    What infuriates me most is that this fellow Deng Tuo blatantly attacked Chairman Mao's scientific thesis of "the East wind prevails over the West wind" as "grandiose empty words" and "clichés." Everyone knows that the Khrushchev revisionists also once scolded our great Party: "It is necessary to more bravely and resolutely expose the dogmatic theory of the absurd 'competition between the West wind and the East wind.'" Does this not precisely prove that Deng Tuo and Khrushchev are singing the same tune and speaking with the same voice?
      "The East wind prevails over the West wind" is a high-level generalization of the international class struggle situation by our great leader Chairman Mao. It encourages the people of the world to carry out the struggle against imperialism and all reactionaries. It is the pointer for our analysis of the international situation. Now, the international class struggle situation is proving that Chairman Mao's scientific thesis is wise, correct, and great. Imperialism and all reactionaries are rotting away day by day in the face of the current situation of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization. The struggle of the oppressed and exploited people of the world against the aggression and oppression of imperialism and all reactionaries, as well as the struggle of true Marxist-Leninists against modern revisionism and to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, is getting better day by day. The future development of the international situation will further prove the wisdom and correctness of Chairman Mao's scientific thesis. It will forever shine with infinite golden light.
    Chairman Mao's scientific thesis of "the East wind prevails over the West wind" is a universally applicable truth that no one can deny! So why does Deng Tuo insist on denouncing it as "grandiose empty words"? The reason is very simple: Deng Tuo is an anti-Party and anti-socialist element, a clown actor in the anti-China chorus composed of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. He fears the people, fears revolution, fears the truth, and fears Mao Zedong Thought even more. Therefore, he cursed our great Party. But the more he curses, the more it shows that our Party is glorious, great, and correct.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all cow demons and snake spirits should be criticized, and they must never be allowed to run rampant." Looking back, I have followed Chairman Mao in making revolution for nearly thirty years. Whether it was fighting the Japanese or fighting the Kuomintang, I have never violated Chairman Mao's teachings. Whatever Chairman Mao told us to do, we did. Now that Deng Tuo and this handful of cow demons and snake spirits have emerged, we will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and overthrow Deng Tuo and his ilk; since the big poisonous weeds such as "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Notes from Three-Family Village" have appeared, we will eradicate them from the roots. But Deng Tuo wants to use "the thirty-six stratagems, running away being the best," can this deceive heaven and cross the sea? To tell you the truth: you can't leave, and you can't run away! In the past, our Five Heroes of Langya Mountain relied on rifles and grenades to defeat more than 3,500 Japanese soldiers on Langya Mountain. Today, we have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. Can you, Deng Tuo, and this handful of cow demons and snake spirits, still run away! Wherever you run, we will chase you; the more you run, the more fiercely we will strike. We will never stop until we achieve complete victory!

    打倒牛鬼蛇神　捍卫党的领导
    现在邓拓一小撮牛鬼蛇神出笼了，我们就坚决把他们打倒；《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》大毒草出来了，我们就把它连根拔掉
    狼牙山五壮士之一　葛振林
    邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙一小撮牛鬼蛇神，都被拖出来了。从邓拓的黑话中，我们一眼就看透，他是这一小撮牛鬼蛇神里的一个头头，是一个在革命队伍中埋藏得很深很深的反党反社会主义的定时炸弹。
    对党怀着刻骨仇恨的邓拓，从一九六一年以来就抛出他的《燕山夜话》，对我们伟大的党进行了恶毒的全面的攻击，辱骂我们党“狂热”、“发高烧”，说“伟大的空话”，害了“健忘症”。这真是狂妄到了极点！
    使我最气愤的，是邓拓这个家伙明目张胆地攻击毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”。大家都知道，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不也曾骂过我们伟大的党：“必须更勇敢和坚决揭露关于荒唐无稽的‘西风和东风’的竞争的教条主义理论。”这不恰恰证明邓拓和赫鲁晓夫是唱的一个调子，同一个鼻孔出气吗！
      “东风压倒西风”，是我们伟大的领袖毛主席对国际阶级斗争的形势的高度概括。它鼓舞着全世界人民进行反对帝国主义和一切反动派的斗争，它是我们分析国际形势的指针。现在，国际阶级斗争的形势，正在证明着毛主席这一科学论断是英明正确伟大的。帝国主义和一切反动派在当前这个大动荡、大分化、大改组的形势面前，正在一天天烂下去，全世界被压迫被剥削的人民反对帝国主义和一切反动派的侵略和压迫的斗争，以及真正的马克思列宁主义者反对现代修正主义、捍卫马克思列宁主义纯洁性的斗争，正在一天天好起来。今后国际形势的发展，还将会更加证明毛主席这一科学论断的英明正确。它将永远闪射出万道金光。
    毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是放之四海而皆准的真理，谁也抹煞不了！那邓拓为什么硬要辱骂它是“伟大的空话”呢？道理很简单，就是邓拓是一个反党反社会主义分子，是一名帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派组成的反华大合唱中的小丑演员。他害怕人民、害怕革命、害怕真理、更害怕毛泽东思想，因此，他破口大骂我们伟大的党。但是，他越骂就越说明我们的党是光荣的、伟大的、正确的。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”追溯过去，我跟随毛主席干革命近三十年，无论是打日本，还是打国民党，从未违背过毛主席的教导，毛主席叫干什么，我就干什么。现在，邓拓这一小撮牛鬼蛇神出笼了，我们就坚决听毛主席的话，把邓拓之流打倒；《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》之类的大毒草出来了，我们就连根把它拔掉。但是邓拓想“三十六计，走为上计”，这能瞒得了天过得了海吗？实话告诉你：你走不了，也跑不了！过去我们狼牙山五壮士就凭步枪加手榴弹，在狼牙山上把三千五百多个鬼子兵都打得落花流水，今天我们更高地举起了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，难道你邓拓这一小撮牛鬼蛇神还跑得了！你们跑到哪里，我们就追到哪里；你们越跑，我们就越狠狠地打。不获全胜，决不收兵！
