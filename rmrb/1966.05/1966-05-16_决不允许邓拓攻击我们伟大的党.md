    Absolutely No Allowing Deng Tuo to Attack Our Great Party
    Wang Guofan, Representative of the National People's Congress, Head of Jianming Commune, Zunhua, Hebei
    After reading the counter-Party, anti-socialist black language of Deng Tuo and his gang, my lungs are about to explode with anger. Deng Tuo, wearing the cloak of a Communist Party member, was engaged in counter-Party, anti-socialist activities. He opened a "Three-Family Village" black shop, using his authority, through the *Beijing Daily* and *Qianxian* under his control, employing coded language and innuendo to attack the Party wildly, attempting to overthrow the Party's leadership and restore capitalism. This is wishful thinking, and we must resolutely struggle against him to the end!
  The Vicious Attacks and Slanders Against the Party are a Waste of Effort
    Deng Tuo, like other demons and monsters, first directed his spearhead of attack at our beloved Communist Party of China. He smeared the words of our Party as "empty words" and "clich√©s," cursed the great achievements we have made in holding high the Party's Three Red Banners as "bragging" and "boasting," and even viciously said that we "smashed our heads and bled" in the face of facts, and "ended" like "the entire belongings of an egg." He attacked our Party for "going back on its word" and being "untrustworthy." This is complete nonsense, and our poor and lower-middle peasants will never believe his nonsense.
    Countless facts show that the leadership of the great Communist Party of China is wise and correct. The Party not only led us to overthrow the three great mountains weighing on our heads in the old China, but also led us to take the road of collectivization, enabling us to gradually change from poverty to wealth, experiencing earth-shaking changes.
    Take our Xipu Brigade as an example. For more than ten years, especially after 1958, we have closely relied on the leadership of the Party, under the glorious light of the Three Red Banners, adhered to the road of collectivization, conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, carried forward the spirit of "poor sticks," worked hard, strived for progress, and finally overcame numerous difficulties, fundamentally changing the past poverty. Just talking about grain production, before liberation, the highest yield per mu was more than one hundred jin. In the three years of the elementary cooperative, the average yield per mu was only 283 jin. In the three years of the advanced cooperative, the average yield per mu was 457 jin. From the establishment of the people's commune in 1958 to 1964, although we suffered severe natural disasters, the average yield per mu reached 580.6 jin (excluding the average yield of 628 jin in 1965). The earth-shaking changes in the Xipu Brigade are a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of the Xipu Brigade's cadres and commune members holding high the Party's Three Red Banners and conscientiously listening to the Party's words.
    The Party's words have touched the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants everywhere. The Three Red Banners illuminate the hearts of the commune members. After 1958, the commune members of Jianming Commune, in order to further change the face of the mountainous area, gave full play to the "poor sticks" revolutionary spirit, and in a few months, built a "Jianming Lake" that they never dared to dream of in the past. It can store 5.21 million cubic meters of water, blocking floods from 37 mountain gullies in the upper reaches. We have also established two electric pumping stations and three large canals more than two hundred li long, making 20,000 mu of land in the entire commune achieve water conservancy. Now, 20 mountain villages in our commune have electricity, three cars, tractors, and electric motors. Just as the commune members said: "In the past, it was three donkey legs and people carrying plows, now it is mules and horses in groups, water pumps, cars, and tractors." It is precisely because of the Party's leadership and reliance on the power of the Three Red Banners that this poor sandy and stony mountain ravine has brought about a good scene of "no need for oxen to till the land, no need for oil to light the lamps, water flowing up the mountains, and no need to worry about food and clothing."
    We deeply realize that the Party's words are true in every sentence. Listening to the Party's words and doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions is definitely right. Resolutely listening to the Party's words can overcome various difficulties and achieve continuous development, and our cause will prosper. Leaving the Party's leadership and not doing things according to the Party's instructions, nothing can be done well, and even go astray. Of the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first. Listening to the Party's words means listening to the Party's words and listening to Chairman Mao's words. The Party and Chairman Mao are always for the people and for the masses in everything. It was the Party that rescued us from the sea of suffering in the old society, enabling us oppressed and exploited poor people to see the light. It was the Party that led us to take the bright road of collective prosperity. Our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply know that without the Party, there would be no good life today. We love the Communist Party and thank Chairman Mao from the bottom of our hearts. Our hearts are closely linked to the Party.
    Who is it that says the Party's words are untrustworthy and scolds the Party's words as "empty words"? This can only be landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all demons and monsters. We love to listen to the Party's words and Chairman Mao's words the most. He represents what we say. If we don't listen to the Party's words or Chairman Mao's words, who else should we listen to? Do we listen to Deng Tuo and his handful of counter-Party, anti-socialist elements? A landlord in our village said: "The Communist Party's words cannot be listened to." See: These words are almost the same as what Deng Tuo said. This shows that Deng Tuo is singing a tune opposite to the broad masses of the people and singing the same tune with the class enemies. What kind of person is Deng Tuo? Isn't it clear?
    While Deng Tuo attacked our Party for "going back on its word" and being "untrustworthy," he smeared our Party's leadership for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." This is to alienate the relationship between our Party and the broad masses and incite the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party. This is really a waste of effort. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can our working people truly become the masters of the country. Take me as an example, before liberation, I was someone trampled underfoot. But today, I am a people's representative, sitting with the leaders of the Party and the state to discuss state affairs. Aren't these all living facts? Why does Deng Tuo want to open his eyes and tell lies? I want to ask: "Who is the 'masses' you are referring to?" Obviously, it refers to that small handful of demons and monsters. Only dictatorship can be exercised against these enemies of the people. Why does Deng Tuo want to speak up for them so much? Doesn't this prove that Deng Tuo and they are birds of a feather?
      Opposing the Party is Counter-Revolution, is
          the Mortal Enemy of Our Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Deng Tuo's vicious attacks and slanders against our great Party are aimed at overthrowing the Party, wanting the Party to step down, and realizing capitalist restoration. That's why Deng Tuo arrogantly shouted that when our Party "encounters a time to speak, it should go to rest." "It must quickly and completely rest, say nothing, and do nothing." This clearly means that we want our Party to step down and let landlords, rich peasants, and revisionists ride on our necks. I warn you, Deng Tuo, this is a daydream! Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China, no socialism, capitalism would be restored, and the Chinese people would have to go backwards, returning to the dark abyss and living a miserable life like cattle and horses. We have tasted enough of the bitterness of the old society. In our commune's Xipu Village, before liberation, out of 154 households, there were 140 poor and hired peasants. Tragic events of selling children and selling daughters, families broken up, and displacement occurred every year. Wang Sheng, who had begged for food for 24 years, his wife fell ill. In a snowy winter, Wang Sheng went out to beg for food himself, and he was blind and the snow was heavy. He accidentally fell into a well and was rescued by someone fetching water. He didn't thank the person, but instead said to the person fetching water with tears in his eyes: "Why did you save me? It's better to let me die and save trouble!" Thanks to the Communist Party, we poor people were liberated. Under the wise leadership of the Party, our "poor mountain ravine" has changed its appearance with barren mountains and evil waters. With the development of production, the people's lives are becoming richer and richer. The Communist Party has given Wang Sheng a new life. The torment of the old society blinded his eyes; the deep suffering made him speechless. It was the Party that cured his eyes, so that the blind man opened his eyes and the "mute" spoke. Now he has built four new tile-roofed houses, and his son has also married a wife. Last year, he received more than 4,000 jin of grain, an average of more than 500 jin per person. Each member of the family has a new quilt and two or three sets of clothes. He happily said: "I never dreamed of this. The blind beggar opened his eyes, saw the electric lights, and lived a life of plenty. All this is thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" In particular, Premier Zhou and Comrade Shehu recently visited Wang Sheng's home, which was something he never expected. Thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, who is our benefactor? Who is our enemy? We poor and lower-middle peasants are very clear. Now, Deng Tuo is arrogantly clamoring for our Party to step down and "rest." We will fight him to the end even if we risk our lives! Opposing the Communist Party is counter-revolution, is the mortal enemy of our poor and lower-middle peasants! If anyone dares to touch a hair of our Party, we will never spare him.
      Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
          and Thoroughly Overthrow All Demons and Monsters
    Deng Tuo and his gang, the landlords, rich peasants, and Khrushchev revisionists, are singing exactly the same tune. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is the agent of the bourgeoisie within the Party. Such a small handful of counter-Party, anti-people reactionary groups must be dragged out and exposed to the light of day, so that the people can recognize their ferocious faces. No matter how cleverly they disguise themselves, they cannot deceive the discerning eyes of the masses. Our Party is an incomparably wise, correct, and great Party, our country is a great country, and our people are a great people. Deng Tuo and his handful of counter-Party, anti-socialist elements, who vainly attempt to pull the wheel of history backwards, will surely smash their heads and bleed and be crushed to pieces.
    It is particularly worth noting that the *Beijing Daily* and *Qianxian* have long served as the mouthpiece of Deng Tuo and others' counter-Party and anti-socialist activities, publishing a series of their counter-Party and anti-socialist articles, causing extremely bad influence. What is even more infuriating is that after Deng Tuo and his gang's counter-Party and anti-socialist faces were exposed, the *Beijing Daily* and *Qianxian* are still playing tricks, carrying out false criticism and true cover-up of Deng Tuo and others, attempting to shift the target, reduce major issues to minor ones, and help Deng Tuo and others muddle through by muddling the waters, in order to preserve their strength and make a comeback. This kind of attacking by retreating is precisely the manifestation of those who stubbornly adhere to the counter-Party stance and continue to attack the Party wildly. We will never let it go easily, and all demons and monsters must be eliminated.
    We poor and lower-middle peasants must closely unite around the Party, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in this battle to defend the Party and defend the socialist Jiangshan, fire on all counter-Party and anti-socialist black lines, destroy the "Three-Family Village," tear off Deng Tuo's painted skin, expose his true colors, and deeply and thoroughly criticize his counter-Party and anti-socialist black language. We will never stop fighting until complete victory is won!
