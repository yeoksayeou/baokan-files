    Absolutely No Allowing Deng Tuo to Attack Our Great Party
    Wang Guofan, Representative of the National People's Congress, Head of Jianming Commune, Zunhua, Hebei
    After reading the counter-Party, anti-socialist black language of Deng Tuo and his gang, my lungs are about to explode with anger. Deng Tuo, wearing the cloak of a Communist Party member, was engaged in counter-Party, anti-socialist activities. He opened a "Three-Family Village" black shop, using his authority, through the *Beijing Daily* and *Qianxian* under his control, employing coded language and innuendo to attack the Party wildly, attempting to overthrow the Party's leadership and restore capitalism. This is wishful thinking, and we must resolutely struggle against him to the end!
  The Vicious Attacks and Slanders Against the Party are a Waste of Effort
    Deng Tuo, like other demons and monsters, first directed his spearhead of attack at our beloved Communist Party of China. He smeared the words of our Party as "empty words" and "clichés," cursed the great achievements we have made in holding high the Party's Three Red Banners as "bragging" and "boasting," and even viciously said that we "smashed our heads and bled" in the face of facts, and "ended" like "the entire belongings of an egg." He attacked our Party for "going back on its word" and being "untrustworthy." This is complete nonsense, and our poor and lower-middle peasants will never believe his nonsense.
    Countless facts show that the leadership of the great Communist Party of China is wise and correct. The Party not only led us to overthrow the three great mountains weighing on our heads in the old China, but also led us to take the road of collectivization, enabling us to gradually change from poverty to wealth, experiencing earth-shaking changes.
    Take our Xipu Brigade as an example. For more than ten years, especially after 1958, we have closely relied on the leadership of the Party, under the glorious light of the Three Red Banners, adhered to the road of collectivization, conscientiously implemented the Party's policy of running the commune diligently and thriftily, carried forward the spirit of "poor sticks," worked hard, strived for progress, and finally overcame numerous difficulties, fundamentally changing the past poverty. Just talking about grain production, before liberation, the highest yield per mu was more than one hundred jin. In the three years of the elementary cooperative, the average yield per mu was only 283 jin. In the three years of the advanced cooperative, the average yield per mu was 457 jin. From the establishment of the people's commune in 1958 to 1964, although we suffered severe natural disasters, the average yield per mu reached 580.6 jin (excluding the average yield of 628 jin in 1965). The earth-shaking changes in the Xipu Brigade are a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of the Xipu Brigade's cadres and commune members holding high the Party's Three Red Banners and conscientiously listening to the Party's words.
    The Party's words have touched the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants everywhere. The Three Red Banners illuminate the hearts of the commune members. After 1958, the commune members of Jianming Commune, in order to further change the face of the mountainous area, gave full play to the "poor sticks" revolutionary spirit, and in a few months, built a "Jianming Lake" that they never dared to dream of in the past. It can store 5.21 million cubic meters of water, blocking floods from 37 mountain gullies in the upper reaches. We have also established two electric pumping stations and three large canals more than two hundred li long, making 20,000 mu of land in the entire commune achieve water conservancy. Now, 20 mountain villages in our commune have electricity, three cars, tractors, and electric motors. Just as the commune members said: "In the past, it was three donkey legs and people carrying plows, now it is mules and horses in groups, water pumps, cars, and tractors." It is precisely because of the Party's leadership and reliance on the power of the Three Red Banners that this poor sandy and stony mountain ravine has brought about a good scene of "no need for oxen to till the land, no need for oil to light the lamps, water flowing up the mountains, and no need to worry about food and clothing."
    We deeply realize that the Party's words are true in every sentence. Listening to the Party's words and doing things according to Chairman Mao's instructions is definitely right. Resolutely listening to the Party's words can overcome various difficulties and achieve continuous development, and our cause will prosper. Leaving the Party's leadership and not doing things according to the Party's instructions, nothing can be done well, and even go astray. Of the thousands of things, the Party's leadership is the first. Listening to the Party's words means listening to the Party's words and listening to Chairman Mao's words. The Party and Chairman Mao are always for the people and for the masses in everything. It was the Party that rescued us from the sea of suffering in the old society, enabling us oppressed and exploited poor people to see the light. It was the Party that led us to take the bright road of collective prosperity. Our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply know that without the Party, there would be no good life today. We love the Communist Party and thank Chairman Mao from the bottom of our hearts. Our hearts are closely linked to the Party.
    Who is it that says the Party's words are untrustworthy and scolds the Party's words as "empty words"? This can only be landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all demons and monsters. We love to listen to the Party's words and Chairman Mao's words the most. He represents what we say. If we don't listen to the Party's words or Chairman Mao's words, who else should we listen to? Do we listen to Deng Tuo and his handful of counter-Party, anti-socialist elements? A landlord in our village said: "The Communist Party's words cannot be listened to." See: These words are almost the same as what Deng Tuo said. This shows that Deng Tuo is singing a tune opposite to the broad masses of the people and singing the same tune with the class enemies. What kind of person is Deng Tuo? Isn't it clear?
    While Deng Tuo attacked our Party for "going back on its word" and being "untrustworthy," he smeared our Party's leadership for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." This is to alienate the relationship between our Party and the broad masses and incite the masses to be dissatisfied with the Party. This is really a waste of effort. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can our working people truly become the masters of the country. Take me as an example, before liberation, I was someone trampled underfoot. But today, I am a people's representative, sitting with the leaders of the Party and the state to discuss state affairs. Aren't these all living facts? Why does Deng Tuo want to open his eyes and tell lies? I want to ask: "Who is the 'masses' you are referring to?" Obviously, it refers to that small handful of demons and monsters. Only dictatorship can be exercised against these enemies of the people. Why does Deng Tuo want to speak up for them so much? Doesn't this prove that Deng Tuo and they are birds of a feather?
      Opposing the Party is Counter-Revolution, is
          the Mortal Enemy of Our Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Deng Tuo's vicious attacks and slanders against our great Party are aimed at overthrowing the Party, wanting the Party to step down, and realizing capitalist restoration. That's why Deng Tuo arrogantly shouted that when our Party "encounters a time to speak, it should go to rest." "It must quickly and completely rest, say nothing, and do nothing." This clearly means that we want our Party to step down and let landlords, rich peasants, and revisionists ride on our necks. I warn you, Deng Tuo, this is a daydream! Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China, no socialism, capitalism would be restored, and the Chinese people would have to go backwards, returning to the dark abyss and living a miserable life like cattle and horses. We have tasted enough of the bitterness of the old society. In our commune's Xipu Village, before liberation, out of 154 households, there were 140 poor and hired peasants. Tragic events of selling children and selling daughters, families broken up, and displacement occurred every year. Wang Sheng, who had begged for food for 24 years, his wife fell ill. In a snowy winter, Wang Sheng went out to beg for food himself, and he was blind and the snow was heavy. He accidentally fell into a well and was rescued by someone fetching water. He didn't thank the person, but instead said to the person fetching water with tears in his eyes: "Why did you save me? It's better to let me die and save trouble!" Thanks to the Communist Party, we poor people were liberated. Under the wise leadership of the Party, our "poor mountain ravine" has changed its appearance with barren mountains and evil waters. With the development of production, the people's lives are becoming richer and richer. The Communist Party has given Wang Sheng a new life. The torment of the old society blinded his eyes; the deep suffering made him speechless. It was the Party that cured his eyes, so that the blind man opened his eyes and the "mute" spoke. Now he has built four new tile-roofed houses, and his son has also married a wife. Last year, he received more than 4,000 jin of grain, an average of more than 500 jin per person. Each member of the family has a new quilt and two or three sets of clothes. He happily said: "I never dreamed of this. The blind beggar opened his eyes, saw the electric lights, and lived a life of plenty. All this is thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" In particular, Premier Zhou and Comrade Shehu recently visited Wang Sheng's home, which was something he never expected. Thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, who is our benefactor? Who is our enemy? We poor and lower-middle peasants are very clear. Now, Deng Tuo is arrogantly clamoring for our Party to step down and "rest." We will fight him to the end even if we risk our lives! Opposing the Communist Party is counter-revolution, is the mortal enemy of our poor and lower-middle peasants! If anyone dares to touch a hair of our Party, we will never spare him.
      Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
          and Thoroughly Overthrow All Demons and Monsters
    Deng Tuo and his gang, the landlords, rich peasants, and Khrushchev revisionists, are singing exactly the same tune. It is not an exaggeration to say that he is the agent of the bourgeoisie within the Party. Such a small handful of counter-Party, anti-people reactionary groups must be dragged out and exposed to the light of day, so that the people can recognize their ferocious faces. No matter how cleverly they disguise themselves, they cannot deceive the discerning eyes of the masses. Our Party is an incomparably wise, correct, and great Party, our country is a great country, and our people are a great people. Deng Tuo and his handful of counter-Party, anti-socialist elements, who vainly attempt to pull the wheel of history backwards, will surely smash their heads and bleed and be crushed to pieces.
    It is particularly worth noting that the *Beijing Daily* and *Qianxian* have long served as the mouthpiece of Deng Tuo and others' counter-Party and anti-socialist activities, publishing a series of their counter-Party and anti-socialist articles, causing extremely bad influence. What is even more infuriating is that after Deng Tuo and his gang's counter-Party and anti-socialist faces were exposed, the *Beijing Daily* and *Qianxian* are still playing tricks, carrying out false criticism and true cover-up of Deng Tuo and others, attempting to shift the target, reduce major issues to minor ones, and help Deng Tuo and others muddle through by muddling the waters, in order to preserve their strength and make a comeback. This kind of attacking by retreating is precisely the manifestation of those who stubbornly adhere to the counter-Party stance and continue to attack the Party wildly. We will never let it go easily, and all demons and monsters must be eliminated.
    We poor and lower-middle peasants must closely unite around the Party, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in this battle to defend the Party and defend the socialist Jiangshan, fire on all counter-Party and anti-socialist black lines, destroy the "Three-Family Village," tear off Deng Tuo's painted skin, expose his true colors, and deeply and thoroughly criticize his counter-Party and anti-socialist black language. We will never stop fighting until complete victory is won!

    决不允许邓拓攻击我们伟大的党
    全国人民代表大会代表、河北遵化建明公社社长　王国藩
    看了邓拓一伙反党反社会主义的黑话，我的肺都要气炸了。邓拓披着共产党员的外衣，干着反党反社会主义的勾当。他开办了个“三家村”黑店，利用职权，通过他操纵下的《北京日报》和《前线》，用隐语黑话，指杨骂柳的手段，猖狂地向党进攻，企图推翻党的领导，复辟资本主义。这是妄想，我们要坚决和他斗争到底！
  对党的恶毒攻击和污蔑是枉费心机
    邓拓和其他牛鬼蛇神一样，把进攻的矛头首先对准了我们敬爱的中国共产党。他污蔑我们党说的话是“空话”、“陈词滥调”，骂我们高举党的三面红旗所取得的伟大成就是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，还恶毒的说什么，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”，象“一个鸡蛋的家当”一样“完蛋”了。他攻击我们党“自食其言”，“不堪信任”。这完全是胡说八道，我们贫下中农绝不信他这套鬼话。
    无数事实说明，伟大的中国共产党的领导是英明的正确的。党不但领导我们推翻了旧中国压在我们头上的三座大山，还领导我们走集体化道路，使我们逐渐由穷变富，经历了翻天覆地的变化。
    就拿我们西铺大队来说吧，十几年来，特别是一九五八年以后，我们紧紧依靠党的领导，在三面红旗的光辉照耀下、坚持集体化道路，认真贯彻执行党的勤俭办社方针，发扬“穷棒子”精神，艰苦创业，奋发图强，终于战胜了重重困难，根本上改变了过去的穷困面貌。光说粮食产量吧，解放前，最高亩产一百多斤，初级社三年，每年平均亩产也不过二百八十三斤，高级社三年，每年平均亩产四百五十七斤，一九五八年人民公社成立到一九六四年，虽然遭受了严重的自然灾害，但每年平均亩产却达到了五百八十斤六两（不包括一九六五年平均亩产六百二十八斤）。西铺大队翻天覆地的变化，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是西铺大队干部和社员群众高举党的三面红旗，认真听党的话的结果。
    党的话，处处说到了咱贫下中农的心坎上了。三面红旗照亮了社员的心。一九五八年后，建明公社的社员，为了进一步改变山区面貌，发挥了“穷棒子”革命精神，在几个月的时间里，就修成了一座过去连做梦也不敢想的“建明湖”。它能蓄水五百二十一万立方米，拦阻上游三十七道山沟的洪水。我们还建立了两座电力扬水机站和两百多华里长的三条大干渠，使全公社二万亩土地实现了水利化。现在我们公社有二十个山村供上了电，有三部汽车，还有拖拉机、电动机。正象社员所说的：“过去是三条驴腿人扛犁，如今是骡马成群、水泵汽车拖拉机。”正是由于党的领导，依靠三面红旗的威力，才给我们这个沙石穷山沟带来了“耕地不用牛、点灯不用油、水往山上流、吃穿不用愁”的好景象。
    我们切身体会到，党的话句句是真理。听党的话，按毛主席的指示去做准没错。坚决听党的话就能克服各种困难，得到不断发展，我们的事业就会兴旺起来。离开党的领导，不按党的指示去做，什么事也办不好，甚至会走到邪路上去。千条万条，党的领导是第一条。听话就要听党的话、听毛主席的话。党和毛主席处处为人民，事事为群众。是党把我们从旧社会的苦海中救了出来，使我们受压迫受剥削的穷人见到了光明，是党领导我们走集体富裕的光明大道。我们广大的贫下中农，深深地知道，没有党就没有今天的好日子。我们都打心眼里热爱共产党，感谢毛主席。我们和党心贴着心。
    是谁才说党的话不可信任，骂党的话是“空话”呢？这只能是地富反坏右和一切牛鬼蛇神。党的话、毛主席的话我们最爱听，他是代表我们说的话，我们不听党的话，不听毛主席的话，还听谁的？难道听邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的话吗？我们村有个地主就说：“共产党的话听不得”。看：这话与邓拓说的简直一样。这说明邓拓同广大的人民群众唱反调，同阶级敌人唱一个调。邓拓是什么样的人，不是清清楚楚了吗？
    邓拓一面攻击我们的党“自食其言”、“不堪信任”，一面污蔑我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”。这就是想离间我们党和广大群众的关系，煽动群众对党不满。这真是枉费心机。只有在中国共产党的领导下，我们劳动人民才能真正成为国家的主人。就拿我来说吧，解放前是被人踩在脚下的人。可是，在今天我当了人民代表，同党和国家领导人坐在一起商量国家大事。这不都是活生生的事实吗？邓拓为什么要睁着眼睛说瞎话呢？我要问：“你指的‘群众’是谁？”显然是指那一小撮牛鬼蛇神。对这些人民的敌人，只能实行专政。为什么邓拓要这么为他们鸣不平呢？这不正说明邓拓和他们是一丘之貉吗？
      反党就是反革命，就是
          我们贫下中农的死对头
    邓拓恶毒攻击和污蔑我们伟大的党，目的是为了推翻党，要党下台，实现资本主义复辟。正是这样，邓拓狂妄地叫喊要我们党“遇到要说话的时候，就去休息”。“必须赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做”。这明明白白的，就是要我们党下台，让地主富农、修正主义分子骑到我们脖子上来。警告你，邓拓，这是白日作梦！没有共产党就没有新中国，就没有社会主义，资本主义就要复辟，中国人民就要走回头路，重新回到黑暗的深渊，过着牛马一般的悲惨生活。旧社会的苦我们已经尝够了。我们公社的西铺村在解放前一百五十四户人家，就有一百四十户贫雇农。卖儿卖女、妻离子散、流离失所的悲惨事件年年有。讨了二十四年饭的王生，他的老婆病倒了。在一个下雪的冬天，王生自己出外讨饭，眼又瞎，雪又大，一不小心掉在井里，被打水的人救上来。他不感谢人家，反而眼含着泪对打水的人说：“你救我干啥？不如让我死了省心啊！”多亏有了共产党，把我们穷人解放了。在党的英明领导下，我们这个“穷山沟”里，秃山恶水变了样。随着生产的发展，人民日子越过越富裕。共产党使王生得到了重生。旧社会的折磨，使他的眼睛瞎了；深重的苦难，使他有口说不出话来。正是有了党，治好了他的眼睛，才使瞎子睁了眼，“哑巴”说了话。现在他盖上了四间新瓦房，儿子也娶上了媳妇，去年分到粮食四千多斤，每人平均五百多斤。全家每人有一床新被子，有两三套衣服。他高兴地说：“我作梦也没有想到这个份上，要饭的瞎子睁开了眼睛，看见了电灯，过上了丰衣足食的日子，这些都得感谢共产党、毛主席的好领导啊！”特别是最近周总理和谢胡同志到王生家里作客，更是他想不到的事情。想想过去，比比现在，谁是我们的恩人？谁是我们的敌人？我们贫下中农心里非常清楚。现在，邓拓竟然狂妄地叫嚣要我们党下台“休息”，我们豁出脑袋也要和他拼到底！反对共产党就是反革命，就是我们贫下中农的死对头！谁要敢动我们党的一根毫毛，我们决不会饶恕他。
      高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
          彻底斗倒一切牛鬼蛇神
    邓拓等一伙人和地主富农以及赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，唱的完全是一个调。说他是资产阶级在党内的代理人，一点也不差。对这样一小撮反党反人民的反动集团，一定要把他们揪出来，暴露在光天化日之下，使人民认清他们的凶恶面貌，不管他们伪装得多么巧妙，也瞒不过群众雪亮的眼睛。我们党是无比英明正确的伟大的党，我们的国家是伟大的国家，我们的人民是伟大的人民。邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子，妄想拉着历史车轮倒退，必将碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨。
    特别值得注意的是，《北京日报》和《前线》长期以来，充当邓拓等人反党反社会主义的喉舌，发表了他们的一系列反党反社会主义的文章，造成极恶劣的影响。更加令人气愤的是，当邓拓一伙反党反社会主义面目暴露以后，《北京日报》和《前线》还在耍花招，对邓拓等人实行假批判、真掩护，企图转移目标，大事化小，以混水摸鱼的手法，帮助邓拓等蒙混过关，以便保存实力，东山再起。这种以退为攻，正是顽固地坚持反党立场的人继续猖狂地向党进攻的表现。我们决不轻易放过它，一切牛鬼蛇神都要除掉。
    我们贫下中农，要紧紧地团结在党的周围，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加这一场保卫党、保卫社会主义江山的战斗，向一切反党反社会主义的黑线开火，捣毁“三家村”，撕开邓拓的画皮，使他原形毕露，把他的反党反社会主义的黑话，批深批透。不获全胜，决不收兵！
