    Abstract: Wu Han's "academic" activities and the academic viewpoints he promoted are permeated with a black line of anti-Party and anti-socialism. After liberation, in a series of articles, reports, and speeches, he carefully selected and recommended historical figures and historical lessons, beautified emperors, generals, and ministers, promoted the reactionary historical views of the bourgeoisie and landlord class, advocated inheriting the morality of the exploiting classes, and vigorously promoted the creation of so-called new historical dramas, all of which had their realistic political purposes. Wu Han was a bourgeois spokesperson who peddled anti-Party and anti-socialist political viewpoints under the guise of "academic" pursuits.
    The author makes a self-criticism of his erroneous viewpoints in the 1962 historical drama debate.
      Are Wu Han's academic activities, academic views, and politics unrelated?
    In the past few months since "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was criticized, many comrades in academic circles have actively participated in this ideological struggle, but there are also some people whispering. Some say, "Linking historical dramas with real-world politics will scare people from writing historical dramas in the future." Others say, "Wu Han praised Hai Rui, but he went to the wrong room; at most, it's a matter of academic viewpoint. Now it's being turned into a political issue, making it difficult to speak." Some even viciously slander, "The criticism of the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' and 'Xie Yaohuan' are all 'trumped up charges,' and if you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext." In his article "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," Wu Han also pretends to be "confused" and repeatedly claims that his "class position in politics is firm, but on the other hand, my class position in academic thought is still basically old, old, bourgeois, and even has feudal elements." Doesn't this so-called "self-criticism" win the sympathy of some people? Comrade Shi Hanren once stood up and loudly exclaimed, "This is understandable," "This can be explained," otherwise, you "need to present the specific materials of Comrade Wu Han's entire social practice for analysis."
    It's as if this academic "secret" palace is dignified and immune to political "invasion"!
    No, let's not deceive ourselves! There has never been scholarship unrelated to politics in the ideological sphere. The deceptive dualism of so-called "class position in politics is firm" but "class position in academic thought is still basically old, old, bourgeois, and even has feudal elements" is nothing more than a self-defense trick created by Wu Han. The large amount of material published so far has fully revealed that, whether in the 1930s, 1940s, or 1960s, Wu Han's "academic" activities have never been separated from politics.
    Indeed, there was a period in the 1950s when Wu Han "disengaged" from "academic" pursuits. Wasn't it? In 1954 and 1955, China's academic circles launched a large-scale struggle to criticize the thought of Hu Shih, and Wu Han, who had such a close relationship with Hu Shih, remained silent, not writing a single word. What does this "disengagement" indicate? It can only indicate that Wu Han has a guilty conscience, or that he is still grateful and unable to forget Hu Shih's "glowing influence." Therefore, the "disengagement" and silence in the 1950s were also not a departure from politics, but closely related to politics, indicating that Wu Han was unwilling to abandon his reactionary stance.
    Wu Han, who had long been absent from the literary scene, suddenly became active again in 1959, writing extensively in newspapers and periodicals. From 1960 to 1963, following the publication of "Collection of Darts" (a collection of his pre-liberation essays), he successively published "Collection Under the Lamp," "Collection of Spring," and "Collection of Learning"; he gave numerous reports and speeches, and edited numerous series of books. Was Wu Han's activity on the academic front due to him "living in such a great era," as he said in the "Preface" to "Collection of Spring," and thus "writing about spring and praising spring"? Marxists never judge a person solely on superficial words, but rather listen to their words and observe their actions in class struggle. Many comrades have revealed that Wu Han's arranged "timeline" for studying Hai Rui closely matched the right-leaning opportunists' anti-Party and anti-socialist politics; that was the "spring" he was "praising." Of course, this black line is not only manifested in the single thread from "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," "On Hai Rui," to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," but runs through Wu Han's entire "academic" activity in recent years. Now let's summarize and see what exactly Wu Han has been propagating in the so-called "academic" issues, and what these propagations are aimed at.
      Carefully selecting and recommending historical figures and "historical lessons," using the past to criticize the present, to cheer up the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office
    In order for the right-leaning opportunists to one day "resume office and rectify discipline," Wu Han not only painstakingly created a towering Hai Rui image of "not succumbing to violence, not being frightened by failure, and trying again after failure" for them, but also carefully selected and recommended some historical figures with the so-called "Hai Rui spirit" who had been dismissed from office and commanders, such as Kuang Zhong, Zhou Chen, and Yu Qian, to further instill "courage" in the right-leaning opportunists. In the article "Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen," he praised Kuang Zhong's so-called "outspoken criticism of the emperor without concealment"; and expressed deep regret for Zhou Chen's "dismissal from office." The most strange thing is the article "Yu Qian, National Hero of the Ming Dynasty." As the title suggests, this should have been an article about Yu Qian's deeds as a "national hero," but at the beginning of the article, Yu Qian's "Ode to Lime" was quoted, talking at length about how lime "is not afraid of burning in fierce fire, not afraid of being crushed to powder, but wants to leave its purity in the world," and vigorously promoting how this Minister of War, though dismissed as commander and killed, had his "reputation restored" by later emperors, deliberately emphasizing that although Yu Qian died, the final victory belonged to him. Between 1960 and 1961, Wu Han carefully selected such "lime" that had been dismissed from office and commanders, vigorously praising them, and extremely beautifying them. What kind of "model" was being established with the deep affection revealed in the words, and for whom were souls being summoned? Isn't this very clear?
    There is another aspect to the matter. In 1962, the trend of right-leaning opportunism resurfaced, as they attempted to overturn verdicts and dreamed of counterattacks. Wu Han probably thought that this was an opportunity not to be missed, and quickly followed up with shouts of support, recommending to people with ulterior motives the article "Investigation of the Hu Weiyong Party Case" that he wrote in 1934, alluding to the fact that the "Hu case" and several other major cases afterwards were all fabricated by Zhu Yuanzhang and "his secretaries" because he did not trust the "meritorious officials and veteran generals." He selected Zhao Kuo and Ma Su with ulterior motives, using these two historical figures from very distant eras to satirically attack, saying that they both "suffered from subjectivism, suffered from doctrinairism, and were self-righteous," "changed the objective reality based on subjective wishes and imagination," "disregarded the objective situation, and did not listen to the advice of experienced people, resulting in a big tumble," and also saying that this kind of "lesson that harms oneself, harms others, and endangers the country" is "still beneficial to revisit today, even though the time has passed for a long time." Wu Han, who has always advocated that historical figures should not be evaluated by modern standards, why did he pile up so many modernized vocabulary on these two historical figures? Moreover, the failure of Zhao Kuo and Ma Su was clearly due to errors in the deployment of two battles. Wu Han, however, talked far away from the topic about how they were "changing the objective reality based on subjective wishes and imagination." Isn't this completely irrelevant? However, during the three years of difficulties, didn't the right-leaning opportunists, under the pretext of the serious natural disasters we suffered and the difficulties caused by the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionist group, throw the same vocabulary of dirty water on our great Party? Wu Han, as a historian, understands the art of allusion and is good at "beating around the bush." He used the so-called "lessons" of the ancients to shoot bullets attacking reality.
    Please see how closely Wu Han's carefully selected and recommended historical figures and "historical lessons" are related to the thread of "scolding" - "discussing" - "dismissing", and how closely they are related to and in coordination with the right-leaning opportunists' anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Wu Han's active support for the right-leaning opportunists' anti-Party and anti-socialist activities precisely proves that what he has always "stood firm on" is the reactionary political stance that has remained unchanged for more than 20 years; he saw in the right-leaning opportunists the ghost of the "democratic individualist" he has always praised, thereby expecting them to become "guides to China's future," "deciding everything and executing everything," "strengthening this new foundation," so as to establish the bourgeois dictatorship he longed for.
      Singing the same tune as the right-leaning opportunists, opposing the teaching revolution and historical revolution led by the Party on the cultural and educational front
    In the years of the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1959, the revolutionary high tide in politics, economy and ideology fiercely impacted the tendency of emphasizing the past and belittling the present in academic circles and universities. A group of revolutionary academic workers and the vast new Marxist forces in universities unprecedentedly promoted the spirit of revolutionary criticism. They began to practice Comrade Mao Zedong's great call to reverse the history that had been distorted and reversed by the ruling class in the past, to restore the working people as the great masters of history, and set about rewriting history. This was the first time that the ideological positions that had long been dominated by the feudal and bourgeois classes faced the threat of being occupied by the proletariat, which aroused the strong hatred of the bourgeois scholars who monopolized this position. Finally, in the years of difficulty, in coordination with the restoration activities of the bourgeois and feudal forces, they combined with the right-leaning opportunists' rampant attacks on the Party on the political and economic front and launched a large-scale counterattack on the cultural and educational front. The right-leaning opportunists clamored that the political and economic front of the Great Leap Forward was "a mess," and the bourgeois literati and scholars shouted that the teaching revolution and the historical revolution in the academic field were "pitch black." In this counterattack, Wu Han was an active fighter. He more than once in reports, speeches, and articles sharply ridiculed the academic revolution of 1958, and directed his attacks against revolutionary academic workers who used Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as guidelines for studying history. In his article "Several Issues in History Textbooks and Historical Research," he said, "Only starting from certain policies and guidelines today, forcing historical reality to obey today's reality, is an unscientific and unhistorical style of study. This trend is very wrong... We must resolutely oppose it." Wu Han, who claimed in the 1930s that he "unconditionally accepted historical materialism," at this time completely shed his fake revolutionary coat and expressed strong hatred for the new atmosphere of studying history with the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism. He said that some people "believe that only things written with the standpoints, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism are history. In the past era, there was no Marxism-Leninism, but only feudalism and idealism. Therefore, old history is completely unbelievable. They therefore adopt a nihilistic attitude towards the great history of the motherland." And he more than once maliciously satirized historical books that quoted the opinions of classical writers as "wasting ink and wasting readers' time." In order to oppose using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as guidelines for studying history, he put forward his own set of reactionary views of "drawing conclusions from history" and even shouted loudly, "Chinese historians have a good tradition of recording facts truthfully, and they are not afraid even of being killed."
    Holding such a deeply disgusted attitude towards the teaching revolution and historical revolution led by the Party, expressing such a strong hatred for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and emphasizing with ulterior motives the need to inherit the "tradition" of sacrificing one's life to defend the old historical positions of the bourgeois and feudal classes, is this merely due to errors in Wu Han's academic thought? In fact, whether in the unbridled past or in the pitiful guise of today, Wu Han is very "sober" in realizing that this is a sharp class struggle under the banner of academic issues. Here, scholarship is politics. Because he understands very well that being able to defend this position can prepare the ideological foundation for the restoration of the bourgeois and feudal classes, and can hide under the historical cloak of restorationism to find new weapons against the Party and socialism.
      Beautifying emperors, generals, and ministers, promoting reverence for ancestors and inheriting their legacy, coordinating with the rampant attacks of bourgeois and feudal forces
    In 1961 and 1962, in coordination with the restoration activities of the bourgeois and feudal forces, a wave of praise for emperors, generals, and ministers also sounded in academic research. Bourgeois scholars were elated by this great reaction that appeared after the academic revolution and delusionally wanted to revive their golden world. In Qufu, Shandong, an ugly farce of worshiping Confucius was even staged. And in this wave of "praising ancestors," Wu Han was another loud voice. In a series of reports and articles, under the pretext of opposing "the theory of sole origin," and opposing the use of class viewpoints to evaluate historical figures, he shouted loudly: "Class origin is by no means the fundamental condition for evaluating historical figures," nor is it "the only criterion" for evaluating historical figures; opposing criticizing "the limitations of the ancients," believing that "it is not in accordance with the principles to criticize the ancients with this requirement"; opposing Mao Zedong's historical materialist view that in Chinese feudal society, only the class struggle of peasants, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars are the true driving force of historical development, accusing many historical textbooks of implementing Mao Zedong's brilliant thesis, "especially emphasizing peasant uprisings," making the history of the motherland "pitch black and bleak"; vigorously promoting that "in the past historical era, in "certain political measures, construction projects, or large-scale wars," "the leading role," "leaders and commanders of these works" were emperors, generals, and ministers; advocating that "emperors, generals, and ministers of prosperous times" represent "the bright side of history," and also especially emphasizing that "one cannot deny his historical contribution because he is an emperor, a king, a prime minister, a general, and his class component is not good; nor can one write him into history because this person's component is very good, has nothing, and comes from a poor or hired peasant, but he has not achieved anything in his life. In this way, there will be too much history, and it will be endless to read, and history will be cancelled"; he loudly questioned: "If we completely say that our ancestors (referring to emperors, generals, and ministers - editor's note) are bad people, and the history of the motherland is pitch black, and we are all descendants of bad people, and our history only starts from scratch today, cutting off history, what is the benefit of this?"
    Wu Han's complacency obviously made him forget a plain truth, that is, these ancestors he respected only relied on exploiting the blood and sweat of the poor and hired peasants who "have not achieved anything in their lives" to have luxurious and extravagant "prosperous times," and that everything in that "prosperous time" was created by the working people.
    Wu Han also obviously overlooked that there is still a "class origin" issue in revering ancestors and recognizing ancestors. The ancestors revered by the Chinese proletariat can only be the ancient working people who, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, are "known to the world for their hard work and endurance," "love freedom and are rich in revolutionary traditions." As for Wu Han himself, if he prefers to choose emperors, generals, and ministers as ancestors, that is Wu Han's freedom, but it cannot be concluded from this that criticizing emperors, generals, and ministers means "completely saying that our ancestors are bad people" and "we are all descendants of bad people." No matter how furious Wu Han is, the historical facts cannot be changed. Different classes can only have their own ancestors. What the Chinese proletariat is proud of are the insurgent peasants who were called "a chorus of overthrow" by Wu Han and overthrew the prosperous dynasties time and time again. The Chinese bourgeoisie and their scholars have always worshiped emperors, generals, and ministers. This is also determined by their "class origin" and class interests.
    Why did Wu Han's nameless fire be triggered by the revolutionary criticism and review that has just begun on historical heritage? Is it really just because there are a few more patches of white powder on the faces of the emperors, generals, and ministers "ancestors"? Marxists should explore the essence through phenomena. Summoning the spirits of the dead to serve their real struggles is a common trick in the history of the bourgeoisie. When the last days of the bourgeoisie arrive, they want to stage this old scene of history again to save their doomed fate. The sharp struggle in the ideological field in our country in recent years has fully proved this point. The wave of proclaiming reverence for ancestors and inheriting their legacy in academic circles happened to be at the moment when feudal culture was rampant in the countryside and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements were carrying out reactionary activities such as continuing their family trees and building ancestral halls. Therefore, Wu Han and his like-minded people, in so-called "academic" research, praised and beautified the feudal ruling class, in fact, they also attempted to use the traditional power of the spirits of the dead and the imperceptible influence of thousands of years to compete for historical status for their descendants today - the landlords and the bourgeoisie who have already collapsed.
      Advocating inheriting the morality of the exploiting classes to counter educating the people with Mao Zedong Thought and hinder the people from establishing a communist world outlook
    In connection with beautifying emperors, generals, and ministers, Wu Han also spared no effort to advocate inheriting feudal morality and bourgeois morality. In the "Preface" to "Collection of Spring", he openly declared: "In the past two years, I have focused my main efforts on writing about historical figures," "hoping that through the introduction of historical figures, the broad masses of the people can understand the history of their motherland, learn from the examples of our great ancestors, and absorb spiritual strength from their diligence, wisdom, and courage." And in Wu Han's mind, this so-called "diligence, wisdom, and courage" can only come from the feudal ruling class. Because he believes that, first, the ruled class and the working people do not have their own morality, that is, "the so-called morality of the class is also the morality of the ruling class"; second, the proletariat cannot "create out of thin air" its own morality, so it can only "be good at absorbing certain excellent things from the past ruling class" and making them "become a component part of socialist communist morality." Therefore, in his opinion, even feudal moral dogmas such as "loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and a sense of propriety, justice, and shame" can "be transformed to make them serve socialism" ("Several Issues in Learning Historical Knowledge"); even the "morality" of the bourgeoisie such as "careful calculation and making money in various ways" should also be "inherited" as "an important principle of socialist business management of enterprises" (see "Speaking of Morality")! Wu Han clearly knew that Marx and Engels had already declared categorically in the "Communist Manifesto": "The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas." But why did he still advocate inheriting feudal morality and bourgeois morality? Was it making the mistake of a fool's dream? Obviously not, Wu Han's purpose in advocating inheriting feudal morality and bourgeois morality was also to provide spiritual weapons for the bourgeois restoration activities, to counter the communist spirit that was beginning to appear among the broad masses of the people in our country. Isn't that right? The very year 1962 when Wu Han was frantically saying, saying again, and saying three times about morality was also the moment when great communist fighters Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu were using Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves, illuminating the road ahead with their brand-new spiritual outlook. Moreover, as early as 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong had already pointed out with revolutionary enthusiasm: "The communist spirit is flourishing across the country. The political consciousness of the broad masses is rapidly improving. The backward strata among the masses are striving to catch up with the advanced strata. This fact marks that our socialist economic revolution (the part of the relations of production that has not yet completed the transformation), political revolution, ideological revolution, technical revolution, and cultural revolution are forging ahead... Many people discuss, there is high enthusiasm, and great energy. Never before have we seen the people so spiritually uplifted, fighting spirit so high, and full of spirit. The past exploiting classes have completely fallen into the vast ocean of the working masses, and they have to change even if they don't want to. There are definitely people who will never change until their death and are willing to go to God with granite brains, but that is irrelevant to the overall situation. All decadent ideologies and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure are collapsing day by day. Thoroughly sweeping away this garbage still takes time; the trend of these things collapsing is certain." ("Introducing a Cooperative")
    The exploiting class will never automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The struggle in the ideological field is even more so. Wu Han precisely saw the crumbling of these decadent ideologies, saw "the trend of these things collapsing," saw Mao Zedong Thought blossoming and bearing fruit among the broad revolutionary masses, saw the people's spirit uplifting, fighting spirit so high, and full of spirit, and was unwilling for his class to "completely fall into the vast ocean of the working masses." That is why he desperately tried to rebuild the ideological position of the exploiting class that had begun to collapse by advocating inheriting the morality of the exploiting class.
      Attempting to bring historical drama creation into the track of using the past to criticize the present
    In his "Self-Criticism" article, Wu Han repeatedly said that when he created "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "the purpose of writing this script was not clear at the time, it was confused"; "the principle of 'using the past to serve the present' and 'emphasizing the present and belittling the past' was not thought of at all at that time, it was completely for the sake of the past and for the sake of writing a play, divorced from politics and divorced from reality." Many comrades have debunked this self-deceiving lie. In the article "The Harm of Confusing Right and Wrong with Eclecticism" (this newspaper on March 16) that I co-authored with other comrades, I also revealed and analyzed the truth of the facts. In fact, not only at the moment when "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was first released did Wu Han and his like-minded people happily congratulate each other, call each other brothers, and talk about how historical dramas "are not for the dead, but to serve the living" and were very sober; Wu Han was so enthusiastic about promoting the creation of historical dramas, discussing them again and again, debating them again and again, writing as many as fourteen articles on historical dramas, and also edited a "Draft List of Historical Dramas," ostensibly acting as a guide, constantly repeating his views on historical drama creation, calling on "friends in the historical community to write some new historical dramas," and join his "first-class dare." All this also shows that he had not forgotten the principle of "using the past to serve the present" and "serving the living." Birds of a feather flock together. Meng Chao and Tian Han, precisely under the "driving force" of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," released the two big poisonous weeds of "Li Hui Niang" and "Xie Yaohuan," making this reactionary social thought in the opera stage have a certain "momentum."
    From 1961 to 1963, a debate on the issue of historical dramas occurred in newspapers and periodicals. This debate was triggered by Wu Han. Now the problem is very clear. Wu Han's hard work in "caring" about the creation of historical dramas and "guiding" the creation of historical dramas was with ulterior motives. He understood the weapon role of drama very well. In his articles discussing historical dramas, he emphasized more than once that "the role of drama far exceeds that of books," "historical dramas have their important role and significance," and "the purpose of historical dramas is for the people of today to learn and absorb certain good qualities of the ancients." Didn't he make this "purpose" very clear by "breaking through the door" and establishing the "tall image" of Hai Rui in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"? "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was revised and revised again, repeatedly, and tirelessly, as many as seven times, and finally completed in the theme of "dismissal from office," in order to highlight Hai Rui's "good qualities" of "not being subdued by the violent and not being intimidated by failure, failing and then doing it again," and let the right-leaning opportunists "learn" and "absorb," and cheer up the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office.
    What kind of new historical dramas do we need, and how should we create new historical dramas? Comrade Mao Zedong already pointed out the clear direction for us as early as 1944 when the Yan'an Peking Opera Theater adapted "Forced to Join Liangshan": that is, we must reverse the historical drama stage ruled by emperors, generals, talented scholars and beautiful women, restore the status of the working people as the masters of the stage, express the people's masses and the class struggles of the people's masses in history, and eliminate the ideological poisoning that traditional historical dramas have long spread among the people's masses. However, for sixteen years since the national liberation, our literary and art circles have been running through a reactionary black line that opposes Mao Zedong's literary and art line. In the work of reforming and innovating opera, not only has the tradition of "Forced to Join Liangshan" not become a trend and promoted nationwide, but even Comrade Mao Zedong's important instructions have been completely put out of mind and never mentioned again. This has made the emperors, generals, talented scholars and beautiful women still rule the opera stage for a long time, until the Peking Opera revolution in 1964, which widely developed revolutionary modern dramas, showed its true and great power to the "innovating" policy. Moreover, in the past ten years or so, there have not been too many new historical dramas adapted with the historical materialist viewpoint as Comrade Mao Zedong required. Precisely because of this, after 1960, the form of the opera stage and historical dramas became a place for the bourgeois and the proletariat to carry out sharp struggles in the ideological field. Wu Han, Meng Chao, and Tian Han all value this "weapon" very much. Wu Han especially emphasized that historical dramas "must be based on characters and facts," even "no word has no source, and no matter has no origin," in order to attempt to allow historical drama writers to still be mired in the historical books of the feudal ruling class, continue to sing the praises of emperors, generals, and ministers. This is the meaning of his emphasis on "historical authenticity." His so-called "historical truth" is to express "the spirit of that era, not the spirit of today." It is to express that Bao Gong and Hai Rui are "good people" and cannot "write them as bad eggs." It is for these "good people," "not necessarily to point out one by one which shortcomings they have while pointing out their advantages." It is writing emperors like Emperor Taizong of Tang and Wu Zetian, "no need to sing the praises and criticize. Otherwise, it will cause confusion among the audience, and it will not be clear whether this is a good person or a bad person, or half a good person, half a bad person, and the educational significance will not be complete. This is the measure," is "to estimate the role of certain emperors, generals, and ministers - the leaders at the time truthfully." In short, he opposed some historical dramas writing the rulers as "wimpy" characters, and opposed writing the feudal rulers as "only able to be led by the nose by the common people." He believed that this did not conform to historical facts and "reduced the educational significance of historical dramas."
    While Wu Han demanded that historical dramas sing the praises and beautify "the leaders at the time" - emperors, generals, and ministers, he also opposed historical dramas "raising up the people," and accused some historical dramas of "inappropriately emphasizing the role of the people. A large group of people went on stage, even if they showed the strength of the people, and did not dare to write about the role of the rulers in history. This would probably vulgarize the view that the people create history."
    Please see, in the "historical truth" that Wu Han emphasized, how much aversion he had to the people taking the stage of opera, and how much he cared for the emperors, generals, and ministers of the so-called "leaders at the time." Therefore, Wu Han's views on historical dramas and Wu Han's "strong interest in historical dramas" also fully show that he attempted to bring the creation of historical dramas into the track of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and restorationist reactionary social trends. In the debate over the seemingly academic issues of historical facts and fiction, Wu Han's required "historical authenticity" also clearly showed a strong political tendency. He wanted the "historical truth" of historical dramas to serve his reactionary political and historical views.
      Wu Han is a bourgeois spokesperson who peddles anti-Party and anti-socialist political views under the guise of "academic" pursuits
    The above is a general epitome of Wu Han's so-called "academic" activities since 1959. It can be described as a comprehensive attack from the fronts of literature, history, and philosophy. The emotions are so狂热, the flags are so鮮明, the theory and creative practice are so "unified", and the coordination of politics and scholarship is so close! All of this is not that "the class position in politics is firmly established," but that "the class position in academic thought is still basically old, old, bourgeois, and even has feudal elements"! We advise Wu Han, don't play around with spears anymore! The iron facts should be changed to a sentence, that is, your anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois reactionary position is indeed firmly established, and your reactionary political activities and your reactionary academic activities are closely combined and integrated. We also advise those whispering people, open your eyes a little! See who you are defending? What kind of "scholarship" are you defending?
    Marxists have always believed that the relationship between academic issues and political issues is a dialectical relationship. That is to say: scholarship always subordinates to the politics of a certain class, there is no supra-class scholarship, and there is no scholarship that runs parallel to politics. However, academic issues are not completely equal to political issues. Scholarship and politics are related and different. If the problems in the academic and cultural fields violate the six political criteria put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong (the most important of which are the two criteria of the socialist road and the leadership of the Party), that is a political issue. We do not completely confuse academic issues and political issues, but we will never allow the guise of academic issues to cover up political issues. From the above, it can be seen that in Wu Han's so-called "academic" activities, there is a clear black line running through from beginning to end, that is, anti-Party and anti-socialism. Wu Han is a bourgeois spokesperson who peddles anti-Party and anti-socialist political views under the guise of "academic" pursuits.
    We must see that, through the so-called "academic" issues, using the last fortress where the exploiting class still has ruling power to blatantly attack the Party and socialism and engage in counter-revolutionary restoration, has become an important means for the bourgeoisie and the proletariat to carry out class struggle under the new situation. They dance and dance and are very arrogant when attacking, and when the situation is no longer favorable, they also attempt to use the guise of academic issues to retreat and maintain the position with the opportunity to make a comeback. Wu Han and his like-minded people are precisely like this. Now, when people present the facts and reason with them to criticize them, they also want to raise the shield of "academic issues" to block people from conducting political criticism. Know that this is impossible. Socialist scholarship can only serve the proletariat and be mastered by the proletariat, and is absolutely not allowed to be monopolized by a few people, and even less allowed to use "scholarship" to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Mistakes must be criticized, and poisonous weeds must be struggled against." The revolutionary people must carry out this great right-and-wrong struggle to the end!
            Self-Criticism on the Historical Drama Debate
    In 1962, I participated in the historical drama debate. In this debate, my ideological views had serious errors:
      (1) Due to a lack of class and class struggle viewpoints, and also because feudal class and bourgeois ideas still had deep roots in my mind, my historical drama views were chaotic. In the historical drama debate, I talked about figures like Cao Cao and Wu Zetian, saying they "are emperors after all" and cannot be "excessively" beautified; I talked about Hai Rui, saying he "is a feudal official after all," and "cannot impose on him thoughts that he could not have," and also affirmed that Hai Rui "did a lot of good things for the people in the feudal era." I thought this was conducting class analysis, but in reality, it was class reconciliation theory. In the article "A Q, Typical, Common Name, and Others," I criticized the theory of using abstract commonality to generalize the qualities of typical figures as a supra-class theory, saying: "It is very dangerous to use abstract adjectives on such issues... Isn't uprightness and incorruptibility also the 'wishes' of the people gasping under the rule of corrupt officials and cruel officials, and also the 'personal' requirements of the feudal ruling class for officials loyal to the feudal system? Figures like Bao Zheng, Kuang Zhong, and Hai Rui have appeared on our opera stage. They are almost the embodiment of the 'ideals' of the wronged people... But can we therefore reconcile the class contradictions contained in them and regard them as the common characteristics of the feudal ruling class and the working people? In fact, this precisely shows the historical and class limitations of the working people in feudal society, which is the key to requiring us to conduct serious class analysis." (New Construction, Issue 2, 1965) But this view of mine itself still did not overcome eclecticism. Because figures like Hai Rui are originally the backbone of the feudal class. What they have always maintained is the interests of the feudal ruling class, and what they have always done is bad things that oppress and exploit the people. There is no way to talk about doing good things for the people at all. The reason why such figures appear on the opera stage lies in the creation of idols and deceptive propaganda by the feudal ruling class, attempting to use this to paralyze the resistance struggle of the masses, rather than any historical and class limitations of the working people. Therefore, this so-called "criticism" not only did not touch the hair of the reactionary historical view of emperors, generals, and ministers, but in essence, it used eclecticism to help it. As for the sinister intentions of the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and Hai Rui operas, I was even more completely unaware, and even affirmed that another big poisonous weed, "Hai Rui Shangshu", was "relatively successful" in the handling of historical facts and fiction. The result of only talking about art while being divorced from politics will be to promote reactionary politics.
      (2) The historical drama debate occurred in early 1961. Wu Han's first article "Talking about Historical Drama" was published at the end of 1960. At this time, emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women began to occupy the opera stage again. However, the initial attempts of the cultural revolution and opera performances of modern dramas in 1958 and 1959 were still fresh in people's minds. Therefore, many comrades opposed Wu Han's point of view of using the so-called

    在吴晗的“学术”活动中贯串着一条什么黑线？
    李希凡
    提　要：吴晗的“学术”活动以及他所宣扬的学术观点，都贯串着一条反党反社会主义的黑线。解放后他在一系列文章、报告、演讲里，精心选择、推荐历史人物、历史教训，美化帝王将相，宣扬资产阶级、地主阶级的反动历史观，鼓吹继承剥削阶级道德，大力提倡所谓新历史剧的创作，都有其现实政治目的性。吴晗是披着“学术”外衣贩卖反党反社会主义政治观点的资产阶级代言人。
    作者对自己在一九六二年历史剧争论中的错误观点进行了自我批评。
      吴晗的学术活动、学术观点和政治是无关的吗？
    《海瑞罢官》受到批判的近几个月，学术界的不少同志都积极参加了这场思想斗争，但是，也有一些人在窃窃私语。有人说：“把历史剧和现实政治拉在一块儿，以后谁还敢写历史剧”。也有人说：“吴晗歌颂海瑞，是走错了房间，至多是学术观点问题，现在搞成政治问题，就难说话了。”有人甚至恶毒地诬蔑说：“对《海瑞罢官》《谢瑶环》的反党反社会主义的批判，都是属于‘罗织’一类，欲加之罪，何患无词”。吴晗在他的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》一文中，也煞有介事地装“糊涂”，一再声称自己“政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的，但在另一面，学术思想上的阶级立场，却还基本上是旧的、老的、资产阶级的，以至还有封建的东西”。吴晗这个所谓“检查”，不是博得了一些人的同情吗？时汉人同志就曾站出来大声疾呼地说：“这是可以理解的”，“这是可以说得通的”，否则，你们就“需要摆出吴晗同志全部社会实践中的具体材料进行分析”。
    真仿佛这个学术的“秘密”之宫，是凛然不受政治“侵犯”的！
    不，还是不要自欺欺人吧！在意识形态领域里从来就不存在与政治无关的学术，所谓“政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的”，只是“学术思想上的阶级立场，却还基本上是旧的、老的、资产阶级的，以至还有封建的东西”的这种骗人的二元论，不过是吴晗制造出来的自我辩护的伎俩。目前发表的大量材料已经充分地揭露，无论在三十年代、四十年代或者六十年代，吴晗的“学术”活动，都没有离开过政治。
    的确，在五十年代，吴晗是有一个时期“脱离”了“学术”的。不是吗？在一九五四、一九五五年我国学术界展开了规模宏大的批判胡适思想的斗争，而曾经和胡适有过那样密切关系的吴晗，却一直一言不发，只字未写。这种“脱离”，说明了什么呢？它只能说明，吴晗的心里有鬼，或者是对胡适的“光耀所及”，仍然感恩戴德，不能忘情。所以五十年代的“脱离”和沉默，这也同样不是离开政治，而是密切联系着政治，它表明吴晗是不肯放弃自己的反动立场的。
    很久绝迹于文坛的吴晗，突然在一九五九年活跃起来，在报纸刊物上大写文章，从一九六○到一九六三年，继《投枪集》（这是他解放前一部分杂文的结集）之后，连续出版了《灯下集》、《春天集》、《学习集》；大做报告、演讲，大编丛书。吴晗在学术战线上如此活跃，是不是象他在《春天集》《序》里所说：由于他“生活在这样伟大的时代里”，才“写了春天，歌颂春天”呢？马克思主义者绝不只在一些表面言词上判断一个人，而是要在阶级斗争中听其言而观其行。不少同志已经揭露了吴晗所排列的研究海瑞的“时间表”，恰恰是密切地配合了右倾机会主义者反党反社会主义的政治，那才是他所“歌颂”的“春天”。当然，这条黑线绝不只是表现在从《海瑞骂皇帝》、《论海瑞》到《海瑞罢官》的一根弦上，而是贯串在吴晗这几年来的整个“学术”活动中。现在我们就归纳起来看一看，吴晗在所谓“学术”问题里究竟都宣扬了一些什么货色，而这些宣扬又都针对着什么？
      精心挑选推荐历史人物、“历史教训”，借古非今，为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子打气
    吴晗为了右倾机会主义者有一日“再居官重整纪纲”，不仅煞费苦心地给他们树立了一个“不为强暴所屈、不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干”的高大的海瑞形象，而且精心挑选推荐了一些具有所谓“海瑞精神”、并被罢官罢帅的历史人物，象况钟、周忱、于谦等，进一步给右倾机会主义者灌注“斗争”的“勇气”。在《况钟和周忱》一文里，他为况钟的所谓“直率的批评皇帝，毫不隐讳”，大叫其好；为周忱的“罢官”吐露深情的惋惜。最奇怪的是《明代民族英雄于谦》一文，顾题思义，这本来应当是一篇写于谦“民族英雄”事迹的文章，可是，此文一开始却引了于谦的《石灰吟》，大谈石灰“不怕烈火焚烧，不怕粉身碎骨，要留清白在人间”，而且大肆宣扬这位兵部尚书虽被罢帅杀害，后代皇帝还不得不为他“恢复名誉”，着意渲染于谦虽死，而最后胜利却属于他。在一九六○到一九六一年间，吴晗精心选择这样一些被罢官罢帅的“石灰”，大肆吹捧，极力美化，其字里行间流露出来的深情蜜意，究竟是在树立什么“样板”，为谁招魂，这不是一清二白吗？
    事情还有另外一个方面。一九六二年，右倾机会主义之风又重新吹动，他们企图翻案，梦想反扑。吴晗大概也以为机不可失，赶紧跟上来呐喊助威，别有用心地向人们推荐他在一九三四年写的那篇《胡惟庸党案考》，意在言外地大谈什么“胡案”以及以后的几桩大案，都是由于朱元璋对“功臣宿将”不放心，而“和他的秘书们”“巧为造作”出来的冤案。别有用心地选出了赵括和马谡，借这两个时代相距很远的历史人物，含沙射影地攻击说，他们都“吃了主观主义的亏，吃了教条主义的亏，自以为是”，“根据主观愿望、想象去改变客观的实际”，“不顾客观形势，不听有实践经验的人们的劝告，结果是摔了大跟斗”，还说什么这种“害己、害人、误国的教训”，“时间虽然隔得很久了，今天来重温这些教训，看来还是有益的”。一向主张不能用现代标准来评价历史人物的吴晗，却为什么给这两个历史人物堆积了这样多的现代化的语汇，而且赵括和马谡的失败，分明是由于两次战役部署的错误。吴晗却离题万里地大谈什么他们是“根据主观愿望、想象去改变客观的实际”，这不是风马牛不相及吗？但是，在三年困难时期，右倾机会主义者不就是假借我们遭受严重的自然灾害和赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团背信弃义所造成的困难，把同样语汇的污水抛洒在我们伟大的党的身上吗？吴晗这位历史学家是懂得春秋笔法的，也善于“指桑骂槐”的，他是借古人的所谓“教训”射出攻击现实的枪弹。
    请看，吴晗精心挑选推荐的这些历史人物和“历史教训”，是何等密切地联系着“骂”——“论”——“罢”这根弦，何等密切地联系和配合了右倾机会主义反党反社会主义的活动。而吴晗所以如此积极地为右倾机会主义者反党反社会主义活动大捧其场，大喝其采，大打其气，恰恰证明，他一直“站稳”的是二十多年来始终未变的反动政治立场；他是从右倾机会主义者身上又看到了他一直在赞颂的“民主个人主义者”的阴魂，从而，期待他们能够成为“中国前途的引导者”，“决定一切，执行一切”，“坚强这新基础”，以建立他所向往的资产阶级专政。
      和右倾机会主义者唱同一腔调，在文教战线上反对党所领导的教学革命和史学革命
    在一九五八到一九五九年的大跃进的年代，由于政治、经济和思想战线上的革命高潮形势猛力地冲击了学术界和高等学校的厚古薄今的倾向，一批革命的学术工作者和高等学校广大的马克思主义新生力量，空前地发扬了革命的批判的锐气。他们开始实践毛泽东同志的把过去被统治阶级所歪曲和颠倒了的历史颠倒过来，恢复劳动人民作为历史主人公的伟大号召，着手重新改写历史。这是封建阶级和资产阶级长期统治的思想阵地第一次面临着被无产阶级占领的威胁，它激起了垄断着这块阵地的资产阶级学者们的强烈的仇恨，终于在困难的年代配合着资产阶级、封建势力的复辟活动，和右倾机会主义者在政治经济战线上对党的猖狂进攻互相结合，在文教战线上来了个大反扑。右倾机会主义者叫嚣大跃进的政治经济战线是“一团糟”，资产阶级文人学士们就喊嚷在学术领域里的教学革命和史学革命是“漆黑一团”。在这次反扑中，吴晗是一个活跃的斗士。他不只一次在报告、演讲和文章中尖刻地嘲笑一九五八年的学术革命，把攻击的矛头指向革命学术工作者运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为研究历史的指针。他在《历史教材和历史研究中的几个问题》一文中说，“只从今天的某些政策、方针出发，强迫历史实际服从今天的实际，是非科学的，非历史主义的学风。这个苗头很不对头……我们必须坚决反对。”这位自称三十年代“就无条件地接受了历史唯物论”的吴晗，这时候完全脱掉了他的假革命的外衣，对用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法研究历史的新气象，表示强烈的仇视。他说：有人“认为只有用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法写出来的东西才是历史，过去时代并没有马克思列宁主义，而只有封建主义，唯心主义，因此，旧历史是完全不可信的，他们因此对祖国伟大的历史采取虚无主义的态度。”而且不只一次恶毒地讽刺引用经典作家意见的历史书，是“浪费笔墨，还浪费了读者的时间”。为了反对以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想作为研究历史的指针，他提出了他自己一整套的“论从史出”的反动观点，而且居然大声疾呼：“中国史家有一个据实记事的好传统，即使有杀身之祸也不怕”。
    对党所领导的教学革命、史学革命持如此深恶痛绝的态度，对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想又表现了如此强烈的仇恨情绪，而对保卫资产阶级、封建阶级的旧史学阵地，又别有用心地强调要继承以身殉之的“传统”，难道这仅仅是由于吴晗学术思想上的错误吗？实际上无论是在肆无忌惮的当时和装出一副可怜相的今天，吴晗都很“清醒”地意识到，这是一场打着学术问题旗号的尖锐的阶级斗争。在这里，学术即政治。因为他很懂得，能够守住这个阵地，就可以为资产阶级、封建阶级的复辟准备思想基础，就可以隐蔽在复古主义的历史外衣下，寻找反党反社会主义的新武器。
      美化帝王将相，宣扬敬祖、继祖，配合资产阶级、封建势力的猖狂进攻
    在一九六一年、一九六二年间，和资产阶级、封建势力的复辟活动相配合，在学术研究中，也响起了一片颂扬帝王将相的声浪。资产阶级学者们对学术革命后出现的这次大反动兴高采烈，妄想重新复活他们的黄金世界。在山东曲阜居然演出了一场拜孔的丑剧。而在这一片“颂祖”的声浪中，吴晗又是一个高音。他在一系列的报告和文章中，借口反对“唯成份论”，反对运用阶级观点评价历史人物，大声叫喊：“阶级出身决不是评价历史人物的根本条件”，决不是评价历史人物的“唯一尺度”；反对批评“古人的局限性”，认为“拿这个要求批评古人，我看并不是合乎原则的”；反对毛泽东同志的在中国封建社会里，只有农民的阶级斗争，农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力的历史唯物主义观点，指责许多历史教材贯彻毛泽东同志这一光辉论点，“特别强调农民起义”，这是使祖国历史“漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”；大力鼓吹“在过去的历史时代里，在“某项政治措施、工程建设或大规模的战争里”，“起主导作用的”、“领导和指挥了这些工作的”，是帝王将相；鼓吹“盛世的帝王将相”代表“历史上的光明面”，而且还特别强调说：“不能因为他这个人是皇帝、是国王、是宰相、是将军，他的阶级成份不好，就不承认他在历史上的贡献；也不能因为说这个人成份很好，一无所有，贫雇农出身，可是他一辈子没有什么成就，也把他写在历史上，这样，历史就太多了，读不胜读了，也就取消了历史了”；他大声质问：“把我们的祖宗（指帝王将相——引者）完全说成坏人，祖国的历史漆黑一团，我们全是坏人的子孙，我们的历史只是今天才从头开始，把历史切断了，这有什么好处呢？”
    吴晗的得意忘形，显然使他忘记了一个平凡的真理，即他所敬爱的这些祖宗，只是依靠剥削那些“一辈子没有什么成就”的贫雇农的血汗，才有了骄奢淫侈的“盛世”，而且那“盛世”所有的一切，也都是劳动人民创造的。
    吴晗显然也忽略了，敬祖宗、认祖宗，也还是有个“阶级出身”问题。中国无产阶级所敬的祖宗，只能是毛泽东同志所说的“以刻苦耐劳著称于世”、“酷爱自由、富于革命传统”的古代劳动人民。至于吴晗自己，如果宁愿选择帝王将相作祖宗，那是吴晗的自由，却不能因此而认定，批判了帝王将相，就“把我们的祖宗完全说成是坏人”，“我们全是坏人的子孙”。不管吴晗怎样暴跳如雷，而历史事实却是改变不了的，不同阶级都只能有自己的祖宗。中国无产阶级引以为荣的，就是那些被吴晗称为“一片打倒声”，一次又一次推翻王朝盛世的起义农民，而中国资产阶级和他的学者们却从来是向帝王将相顶礼膜拜的，这也是他们的“阶级出身”、阶级利益所决定的。
    为什么对历史遗产还是刚刚展开革命的批判的审查，就触发了吴晗的无名之火呢？真真仅仅是由于帝王将相“祖宗”的脸上多了几块白粉吗？马克思主义者应当透过现象探究本质。召唤亡灵，为他们的现实斗争服务，这是资产阶级的历史惯技。当资产阶级末日到来的时候，他们又想演出这旧的历史的一幕，以挽救被灭亡的命运。我国近年来的意识形态领域里的尖锐斗争，充分地证明了这一点。学术界宣扬敬祖、继祖的声浪，恰恰是发生在农村封建文化泛滥、地富反坏大肆进行续家谱、修祠堂等反动活动的时刻，因而，吴晗和其志同道合者，在所谓“学术”研究中，颂扬和美化封建统治阶级，实际上也就是企图运用亡灵的传统力量的千百年来的潜移默化的影响，为他们今天的子孙，——已经坍了台的地主阶级和资产阶级争夺历史地位。
      鼓吹继承剥削阶级道德，借以对抗用毛泽东思想教育人民，阻碍人民树立共产主义世界观
    和美化帝王将相相联系，吴晗还不遗余力地鼓吹继承封建道德和资产阶级道德。他在《春天集》《序》里，公开声明：“这两年我把主要力量放在写历史人物上”，“希望通过历史人物的介绍，让广大人民了解自己祖国的历史，学习我们伟大先人的榜样，从他们勤劳、智慧、勇敢的美德中，吸取精神力量”。而在吴晗的心目中，这所谓“勤劳、智慧、勇敢的美德”，又只能是来自封建统治阶级。因为他认为，第一，被统治阶级、劳动人民是没有自己的道德的，即“所谓阶级的道德也就是统治阶级的道德”；第二，无产阶级不能“凭空创造”自己的道德，所以只有“善于吸取过去统治阶级某些优良的东西”，使它们“成为社会主义共产主义道德的组成部分”。于是，在他看来，甚至连“忠孝节义，礼义廉耻”这些封建道德教条，都“可以把它改造，使它为社会主义服务”（《学习历史知识的几个问题》）；连资产阶级的“精打细算，多方赚钱”的“道德”，也要把它“继承”为“社会主义经营管理企业的一条重要原则”（见《说道德》）！吴晗明明知道，马克思、恩格斯早在《共产党宣言》中，就斩钉截铁般地宣布过：“共产主义革命就是同过去遗传下来的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；所以，毫不奇怪的，它在自己发展的过程中要同过去遗传下来的种种观念实行最彻底的决裂。”但他为什么还要鼓吹继承封建道德和资产阶级道德呢？是犯了痴人说梦的错误吗？显然不是，吴晗提倡继承封建道德和资产阶级道德的目的，同样也是为资产阶级复辟活动提供精神武器，以对抗开始出现在我国广大群众中间的共产主义精神的闪光。不是吗？正当吴晗狂热地一说、再说、三说道德的一九六二年，也是伟大共产主义战士雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、焦裕禄，正在用毛泽东思想武装自己，以他们崭新的精神面貌照亮前进道路的时刻。而且早在一九五八年，毛泽东同志就已充满革命豪情地指出过：“共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展。广大群众的政治觉悟迅速提高。群众中的落后阶层奋发起来努力赶上先进阶层，这个事实标志着我国社会主义的经济革命（生产关系方面尚未完成改造的部分）、政治革命、思想革命、技术革命、文化革命正在向前奋进。……人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变。至死不变、愿意带着花冈岩头脑去见上帝的人，肯定有的，那也无关大局。一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。”（《介绍一个合作社》）
    剥削阶级决不会自动退出历史舞台。在意识形态领域里的斗争更是如此。吴晗正是看到了这些腐朽的意识形态的土崩瓦解，看到了“这些东西崩溃之势已成”，看到了毛泽东思想在广大革命群众中的开花结果，看到了人民群众的精神振奋、斗志昂扬、意气风发，而不甘心自己的阶级“完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中”，才妄想用鼓吹继承剥削阶级道德的垂死挣扎，重筑那已经开始倒坍的剥削阶级的思想阵地。
      妄图把历史剧创作纳入借古非今的轨道
    吴晗在他的“自我批评”一文里，一再说他创作《海瑞罢官》的时候，“写这个剧本的目的性，在当时是不清楚的，是糊涂的”；“‘古为今用’‘厚今薄古’的原则在当时一点也没有想起过，完全是为古而古，为写戏而写戏，脱离了政治，脱离了现实”。不少同志都拆穿过这种自欺欺人的谎话。我在和别的同志合写的《不能用折衷主义混淆是非》（三月十六日本报）一文中，也曾揭露和分析了那事实的真象。其实岂只是在《海瑞罢官》刚刚出笼的时刻，吴晗就和志同道合者一起兴高采烈，称兄道弟，大谈历史剧“不是为了死人，而是为活人服务”，十分清醒；吴晗那样热中于提倡历史剧的创作，一论再论，一辩再辩，写了有关历史剧文章达十四篇之多，并且还主编了一本《历史剧拟目》，俨然以指导者自居，不断重复他的关于历史剧创作的主张，号召“历史学界的朋友们，大家来写点新历史剧”，参加他的“敢的一流”，这一切，也都表明，他何尝忘记过“古为今用”“为活人服务”的原则。物以类聚，孟超和田汉，就正是在《海瑞罢官》的“带动之下”，放出了《李慧娘》和《谢瑶环》这两棵大毒草，使戏曲舞台上的这个反动社会思潮有了一定的“声势”。
    从一九六一到一九六三年，报纸刊物上发生了一场关于历史剧问题的争论，这场争论是由吴晗挑起的。现在问题已经十分清楚，吴晗所以那样卖力气“关心”历史剧的创作，“指导”历史剧的创作，是别有用心的。他很了解戏剧的武器作用，在他谈论历史剧的文章里，不只一次地强调，“戏剧的作用是远远超过书本的”，“历史剧是有其重要作用和意义的”，“历史剧的目的，是要今人学习、吸收古人的某些好的品质”。他“破门而出”，在《海瑞罢官》中树立海瑞的“高大形象”，不就把这个“目的性”表现得很清楚了吗？《海瑞罢官》一改再改，多次反复，不厌其烦，达七遍之多，最后在“罢官”的主题中得到了完成，就是为了突出海瑞的“不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干”的“好的品质”，而让右倾机会主义者“学习”“吸收”，为被罢了官的右倾机会主义者打气。
    我们究竟需要什么样的新历史剧，应当怎样创作新历史剧，毛泽东同志本来早在延安平剧院改编《逼上梁山》的一九四四年，就给我们指出过明确的方向：即必须把帝王将相才子佳人统治着的历史剧舞台颠倒过来，恢复劳动人民的舞台主人公的地位，表现历史上的人民群众和人民群众的阶级斗争，肃清传统历史剧在人民群众中间长期散播的思想毒害。可是，全国解放以后十六年来，我们的文艺界一直贯串着一条对抗毛泽东文艺路线的反动黑线，在戏曲改革推陈出新的工作中，不只没有把《逼上梁山》的传统，蔚成风气，推向全国去，甚至完全把毛泽东同志的这一重要指示，置诸脑后再不提起。这就使帝王将相才子佳人仍然长期统治着戏曲舞台，直到一九六四年广泛发展革命现代戏的京剧大革命，才使“推陈出新”的方针显示了真正伟大的威力；而且十几年来，真正如毛泽东同志所要求的用历史唯物主义观点改编的新历史剧也不太多。正是因为这样，一九六○年以后，戏曲舞台、历史剧的形式，才成了资产阶级和无产阶级在意识形态领域里进行尖锐斗争的场所。吴晗、孟超、田汉就都很看重这个“武器”。吴晗所以特别强调历史剧的“人物、事实要有根据”，甚至，“无一字无来历，无一事无出处”，就是企图要历史剧作者仍然沉陷在封建统治阶级的史书里，继续为帝王将相歌功颂德，这就是他那样强调“历史真实性”的含义。他所谓的“历史真实”是要表现“那个时代的时代精神，而不是今天的时代精神”。是要表现包公、海瑞是“好人”，不能“把他们写成坏蛋”。是对于这些“好人”，“不一定非要在指出优点的同时，逐一指出哪几项缺点不可”。是写唐太宗、武则天这类皇帝，“不需要又歌颂又批判。要不然，就会在观众中造成混乱，分不出这是好人是坏人，还是半个好人，半个坏人，教育意义也就不完全了。这就是分寸”，是“如实地估计某些帝王将相——当时领导人的作用”。总之，他反对有些历史剧把统治者写成“窝窝囊囊”的人物，反对把封建统治者写成“只能由老百姓牵着鼻子走”。他认为这不符合历史事实，也“降低了历史剧的教育意义”。
    吴晗一方面要求历史剧歌颂、美化“当时领导人”——帝王将相，一方面又反对历史剧“抬出人民群众来”，指责有些历史剧“不适当地强调人民群众的作用，一大群人民群众上了台，就算表现了人民群众的力量，不敢写统治者在历史上的作用，这恐怕就把人民群众创造历史的观点庸俗化了”。
    请看，在吴晗所强调的“历史真实”性里，他对人民群众登上戏曲舞台有着多么反感的情绪，而对所谓“当时领导人”的帝王将相，又是何等的爱护倍至。所以吴晗的历史剧见解，吴晗的“对历史剧有浓厚的兴趣”也充分表明了，他是企图把历史剧创作纳入反党反社会主义和复古主义的反动社会思潮的轨道，在看来是学术问题的史实和虚构关系的争论中，吴晗所要求的“历史的真实性”，也分明显示了强烈的政治倾向，他是要历史剧的“历史真实”为他的反动的政治观和历史观服务的。
      吴晗是一个披着“学术”外衣贩卖反党反社会主义政治观点的资产阶级代言人
    以上就是一九五九年以来吴晗的所谓“学术”活动的一个概略的缩影，真可谓从文史哲各条战线上全面出击。情绪是如此狂热，旗子是这样鲜明，理论和创作实践又如此“统一”，政治和学术的配合是这样的紧密！这一切的一切，难道都是什么“政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的”，只是“学术思想上的阶级立场，却还基本上是老的、旧的、资产阶级的，以至还有封建的东西”吗！我们奉劝吴晗，还是不要掉花枪吧！铁的事实应当是换一句话，即你的反党、反社会主义的资产阶级反动立场的确是站稳了的，你的反动的政治活动和你的反动的学术活动，是紧密结合，互为一体的。我们也奉劝那些窃窃私语的人们，还是把眼睛睁大一点吧！看看你们究竟是在为什么人辩护？为什么“学术”辩护？
    马克思主义者一向认为学术问题和政治问题的关系，是辩证的关系。这就是说：学术总要从属于一定阶级的政治，没有超阶级的学术，也没有与政治并行的学术。但学术问题不完全等于政治问题，学术和政治有联系又有区别。学术文化领域中的问题，如果违反了毛泽东同志所提出的六条政治标准（其中最主要的是社会主义道路和党的领导两条），那就是政治问题。我们不把学术问题和政治问题完全混同起来，但是，我们也绝不允许用学术问题的幌子来掩盖政治问题。从以上种种可以看出，在吴晗的所谓“学术”活动中，从头到尾贯串着一条清楚的黑线，那就是反党反社会主义。吴晗是一个披着“学术”外衣贩卖反党反社会主义政治观点的资产阶级代言人。
    我们必须看到，通过所谓“学术”问题，利用剥削阶级还有统治力量的这个最后堡垒，对党对社会主义猖狂地进攻，搞反革命复辟，已经成为新形势下资产阶级和无产阶级进行阶级斗争的重要手段。在进攻时他们手舞足蹈，嚣张得很，等形势不再有利的时候，他们又妄图假借学术问题的外衣，退却下来保持有机会卷土重来的阵地。吴晗和他的志同道合者正是这样，现在当人们摆事实、讲道理对他们进行批判的时候，他们又想打起“学术问题”的盾牌，阻挡人们进行政治上的批判。要知道，这是办不到的。社会主义的学术，只能是为无产阶级服务，为无产阶级所掌握的学术，绝不允许为少数人所垄断，更不允许利用“学术”进行反党反社会主义的活动，正如毛泽东同志所说：“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”革命人民一定要把这场大是大非之争进行到底！
            关于历史剧争论的自我批评
    在一九六二年，我是参加了历史剧争论的。在这场争论中，我的思想观点有严重的错误：
      （一）由于缺乏阶级、阶级斗争观点，也由于封建阶级、资产阶级的思想在我的脑子里还有很深的根子，我的历史剧见解是混乱的。在历史剧争论中，我谈到过曹操、武则天这类人物
  “毕竟是皇帝”，不能“过分”美化；谈到过海瑞“毕竟是封建官吏”，“不能把他所不能有的思想强加给他”，还肯定海瑞“在封建时代为人民做了不少好事”。自以为这是在进行阶级分析，而实际上是阶级调和论。在《阿Q、典型、共名及其他》一文中，我批评过用抽象的共性来概括典型人物的品质是超阶级的理论，说：“在这样的问题上用抽象的形容词，是很危险的。……正直、廉洁，不也是喘息在贪官酷吏统治下的人民的‘愿望’，而又是封建统治阶级对于忠于封建制度的官吏的‘个人’要求吗？在我国的戏曲舞台上出现过包拯、况钟、海瑞这样的人物，他们几乎是受冤人民的‘理想’的化身，……但难道能够因此就调和其中所体现的阶级矛盾的内容，把它们看成是封建统治阶级和劳动人民的共性概括吗？实际上这恰恰是表现了封建社会的劳动人民的历史和阶级的局限性，需要我们认真进行阶级分析的关键所在”。（一九六五年第二期《新建设》）但我的这种观点本身仍然没有克服折衷主义。因为海瑞之类的人物本来就是封建阶级的骨干，他们所维护的从来都是封建统治阶级的利益，他们所干的，也从来都是压迫、剥削人民的坏事，根本谈不上替人民做过什么好事。戏曲舞台上所以出现这类人物，根子在于封建统治阶级的制造偶象、欺骗宣传，妄图借此麻痹群众的反抗斗争，而不是什么劳动人民的历史的阶级的局限性。所以这种所谓“批评”，不仅没有触动帝王将相反动历史观的一根毫毛，而且实质上是用折衷主义给它帮了腔。至于对《海瑞罢官》和海瑞戏的反党反社会主义的险恶意图，我就更是毫无觉察了，甚至还肯定了另一株大毒草《海瑞上疏》在史实和虚构的处理上“比较成功”。脱离政治只谈艺术的结果，就会给反动的政治张目。
      （二）历史剧的争论发生在一九六一年初，吴晗的第一篇《谈历史剧》的文章是发表在一九六○年底，这时帝王将相、才子佳人又开始占领戏曲舞台，但是，一九五八、一九五九年的文化革命，戏曲演现代戏的初步尝试，对人们还是记忆犹新的。因此，不少同志反对吴晗用历史记载的所谓“人物、事实都要有根据”的论点限制历史剧的创作，提出应当由劳动人民占领戏曲舞台主人公的地位，坚持新历史剧的革命方向。论争本该从此继续深入，而我的参加争论，却没有抓住本质问题，只是陷入史实和虚构的艺术处理上的分歧，把它变成了历史剧“正名”之争，反而给吴晗招来了不少支持者，在读者中间制造了混乱。
    这次由所谓新历史剧而揭开的反党反社会主义思潮，给了我深刻的教育。历史剧创作的中心问题，绝不是什么史实和虚构的关系，而是站在什么立场用什么观点写历史剧，是历史剧为那个阶级服务的问题。我在和冯其庸同志合写的《田汉的〈谢瑶环〉是一棵大毒草》（发表在二月一日本报）一文中，说明了一点我们的初步认识，这里不再重复。
    在我国的思想战线上，一场彻底清除一切剥削阶级毒害人民的意识形态的社会主义文化大革命开始了！广大工农兵群众和马克思主义的新生力量已经拿起笔来，用伟大毛泽东思想的锐利武器，对学术文化领域里的反党反社会主义的毒草，对资产阶级、封建阶级的意识形态展开了猛烈的大反攻。照照镜子，看看自己，从历史剧争论中暴露出来的思想错误（而且绝不只是这几篇文章，其他一些文章也有不少错误观点），使我痛心地感到，资产阶级和封建阶级的思想对我还有很大的影响，我愿意在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，努力加强马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的学习，努力向工农兵学习，一面改造、一面战斗，继续清理、批判自己头脑里的错误思想、错误观点。
