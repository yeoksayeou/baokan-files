    Overthrow the Bourgeoisie's "Authority"
    Tan Jingde, Xinchang Commune, Nanhui County
    I am a rural youth. In the past, I had a blind faith in "famous figures" like Xia Yan and Tian Han, thinking they were "highly cultured" and "knowledgeable," and that what they wrote must be extraordinary. Recently, after reading the criticisms of them in the newspapers and studying the Liberation Army Daily's editorial "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution," my mind has become clear. It turns out that these "famous figures" are not "figures" who serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor are they "figures" who serve socialism, but rather "figures" who wholeheartedly serve the bourgeoisie. Their cultural knowledge is not red, but black. What they write, to the proletariat and the working people, is not only not extraordinary, but also harmful, the kind of stuff found in the black line that opposes the Party and opposes socialism. They want our culture and art to return to the 1930s, which means they want us to leave the socialist path and take the capitalist road of retreat.
    If poisonous weeds are not uprooted, crops will not grow. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must become the masters of culture, and we must rise up and participate in this great battle on the cultural front to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology. We must overthrow the bourgeoisie's "authority" and drive those feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist "Buddha masters" down from their "thrones."

    打倒资产阶级的“权威”
    南汇县新场公社　谈敬德
    我是一个农村青年。过去，我对夏衍、田汉等等“名家”有迷信，以为他们“文化高”，“知识足”，写出来的东西一定都是很了不起的，最近这些日子，看了报纸上对他们的批判，又学习了解放军报的社论《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》，脑子豁亮了。原来他们这些“名家”，不是替工农兵服务的“家”，不是替社会主义服务的“家”，而是道道地地替资产阶级服务的“家”。他们的文化知识，不是红的，是黑的。他们写出来的东西，对于无产阶级和劳动人民说来，不但没有什么了不起，而且是害人的东西，是反党反社会主义的黑线里的货色。他们要我们的文化艺术回到三十年代去，就是要我们离开社会主义的道路，走资本主义的回头路。
    毒草不锄，庄稼不长。我们工农兵要做文化的主人，就一定要起来参加文化战线上这场兴无灭资的大战，我们要打倒资产阶级的“权威”，要把那些封建的、资产阶级的、修正主义的“菩萨老爷”从他们的“宝座”上赶下来。
