    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st) Overseas Chinese from all walks of life in Shanghai held a rally on the 20th, angrily denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in persecuting overseas Chinese, and firmly supporting the note of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.

    At the meeting, overseas Chinese from all walks of life solemnly warned the Indonesian government: The people of the Mao Zedong era are not to be insulted. Your actions of vigorously opposing communism and the people while stirring up a violent anti-China and anti-Chinese wave in order to cater to the needs of US imperialism can only expose your ugly face as a pawn of US imperialism in anti-China activities and only accelerate your demise.

    Zhou Xiuli, a "Five-Good" worker from Shanghai, accused the Indonesian right-wing thugs of killing her father and younger brother. She said, "Now, my mother and four younger siblings are destitute and have no means of support. Many of the overseas Chinese neighbors around my home and overseas Chinese relatives in other places have also been ravaged and persecuted. Some were dismembered, some were disemboweled, and some were thrown into the river to drown. The cruelty is appalling." She said that this is truly shameless. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are laden with blood debts, which the people of the world can see clearly and cannot deny in any way.

    Huang Qinshu, chairman of the Shanghai Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, made a written statement at the meeting. He firmly demanded that the Indonesian government make a satisfactory reply to the note of the Chinese government as soon as possible, immediately stop the atrocities of persecuting overseas Chinese, release all arrested and detained overseas Chinese, ensure the safety of overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China, and not obstruct China's work of sending ships to receive overseas Chinese.

    Liu Liangmo, vice chairman of the Shanghai Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, pointed out in his speech that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' frantic anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are part of a conspiracy by US imperialism to oppose communism, China, and the people. He said, we want to solemnly tell imperialism and all reactionaries: The era when the Chinese people were at the mercy of others is long gone. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries attempt to prevent China from advancing, just like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, and will definitely be crushed by the wheels of history. All the anti-China "heroes" in the world will never have a good end.

    (Xinhua News Agency, 21st) Returned overseas Chinese in Nanning, Kunming, Tianjin, Wuhan, Changchun, Changsha, Hangzhou, and other places held rallies yesterday and today to denounce the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in persecuting overseas Chinese. They expressed their firm support for the May 18th note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Embassy in China and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and solemnly demanded that the Indonesian government make a satisfactory reply to the note of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible.

    The Returned Overseas Chinese Federation of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Nanning City jointly held a rally on the 20th. Seventeen returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia accused the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces of the crimes of brutally killing and persecuting their relatives. Li Renren, deputy director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, made a written statement at the meeting. He pointed out that the anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces cannot damage the great prestige of the great People's Republic of China in the world, and can only expose the ugly face of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces as pawns of US imperialism. He expressed his sincere condolences to the overseas Chinese who were victimized in Indonesia, and warmly welcomed the victimized overseas Chinese who are about to return to China. Huang Yinfa, a returned overseas Chinese, accused the Indonesian right-wing thugs of robbing his family of all their property and then detaining his parents in prison for forty days. In order to block the news, the right-wing authorities also threatened the arrested overseas Chinese. Huang Yinfa warned the Indonesian right-wing that the revolutionary Chinese people have never been afraid of violence. The Indonesian reactionaries, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese, will never have a good end. Pan Qingqi, vice chairman of the Autonomous Region Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, who lived in Indonesia for thirty-nine years, said that the "Red River" in Jakarta was named because the blood of the Indonesian people and Chinese overseas Chinese flowed into a river in the joint battle against the Dutch colonists. The Indonesian oil mines, tin mines, rubber plantations, and pepper gardens are also covered with the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese. He said that the Chinese people and the Indonesian people have had friendly cooperative relations throughout history, and this relationship cannot be destroyed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

    The Returned Overseas Chinese Federation of Yunnan Province and Kunming City held a rally on the 20th. Wang Zhaoming, chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Returned Overseas Chinese Federation and deputy mayor of Kunming, pointed out at the meeting that the anti-Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces fully exposed their hideous faces as executioners of US imperialism. Li Defu, an auto worker, said that his relatives engaged in agricultural production in Indonesia and lived in harmony with the local people. But not long ago, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces barbarously kidnapped his sister-in-law and nephew, and their whereabouts are still unknown. He said: These fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces cannot scare the liberated Chinese people, nor can they scare the overseas Chinese who have a strong socialist motherland as their backing. You have done all the bad things, and you will never escape the punishment of history.

    At the rally held by returned overseas Chinese in Tianjin today, Lu Yuqing, a technician from the Tianjin Tractor Factory, accused the Indonesian right-wing thugs of not only brutally injuring his mother, but also looting his home eight times, robbing and destroying all his property. At the meeting, he angrily showed two photos taken after his home was looted and said that overseas Chinese are no longer the "orphans abroad" before 1949, nor are they lambs to be slaughtered. The more rampant the reactionaries are, the more it shows that they are weak, and the closer they are to their demise. Xie Jianzhang, a student at Tianjin University whose uncle was killed by Indonesian right-wing thugs, Xu Sumin, a returned overseas Chinese student whose house and property were burned and looted by right-wing thugs, and Xie Maokan, a doctor, and Lin Deshi, a worker, pointed out at the meeting that the Chinese people do not even take the US imperialists armed to the teeth seriously, let alone this small group of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. The Chinese people of the Mao Zedong era are not afraid of ghosts. All the anti-China "heroes" in the world have never had a good end, and the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces will be no exception.

    Xie Xin, chairman of the Hubei Provincial Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, said at a rally held by returned overseas Chinese in the Wuhan area on the 20th that the Indonesian reactionaries' horrifying burning, killing, and looting of overseas Chinese were more brutal than Hitler in those years. Huang Dushen, a cadre from the Wuhan Vegetable Company whose family members are still in Indonesia, angrily exposed that the Indonesian right-wing thugs set fire to his home and many overseas Chinese houses in the area, forcing his father and a large number of overseas Chinese to lose their homes and become displaced. He said that his family's experience is the experience of tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Blood debts must be paid. The Indonesian people and the Chinese people will never forgive the crimes of these thugs. Hou Qixin, chairman of the Wuhan Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, and Luo Shaosen, a veteran worker from the Qingshan Shipyard, pointed out at the meeting that the anti-China and anti-Chinese are only a small group of Indonesian right-wing elements, and do not represent the will of the broad masses of the Indonesian people. Overseas Chinese have lived on the land of Indonesia for generations. They have worked hard and made important contributions to the development of Indonesia's national economy and the struggle against imperialism and colonialism's aggression against Indonesia, and have established close friendship with the Indonesian people. This is a fact that everyone can see.

    At a rally held by returned overseas Chinese from all walks of life in Changchun City on the morning of the 21st, many overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia used the experiences of their relatives being persecuted to angrily accuse the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces of their barbaric atrocities. Ou Fengyun, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a student at Jilin University of Technology, revealed: "On the evening of October 25th and the morning of October 26th last year, Indonesian right-wing thugs cruelly robbed, burned, and killed my family and the overseas Chinese living around us. Now, my mother and younger siblings are missing and their whereabouts are unknown." He said that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are guilty and cannot deny it. The Chinese people, the Indonesian people, and the people of the world must settle this blood debt with them.

    Returned overseas Chinese in Changsha City held a rally on the 20th. Zhang Chengyu, a returned overseas Chinese, said excitedly at the meeting: "When I heard the news that our government was preparing to send ships to transport the victimized overseas Chinese back to China, I was so excited that I shed tears. Our great socialist motherland is the most reliable backing for overseas Chinese." The uncles of returned overseas Chinese Xie Lianfen and Li Zhenrong were killed by Indonesian right-wing thugs not long ago. They angrily pointed out at the meeting that the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing thugs will definitely not escape the punishment of the people. Wang Qianyu, a member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, refuted the Indonesian government's shameless lies that overseas Chinese returned to China because of the Chinese government's orders and political measures. He pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' brutal persecution of overseas Chinese is a fact, and it cannot be denied in any way. Li Huiqu, who now works at the Hunan Provincial Research Institute of Culture and History and lived in Indonesia for thirty-one years, and Li Anguang, a returned overseas Chinese who was born and raised in Indonesia, both pointed out that the hardworking and kind Indonesian people have brotherly friendship with the overseas Chinese. The Indonesian government falsely accuses them in the name of the people, which just shows that they are afraid of the Indonesian people and the Chinese people being friendly with each other. They pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are anti-China and anti-Chinese because the Chinese government insists on opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces attempt to shift the blame for their anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities to the Indonesian people, and the result can only be to further expose their reactionary face of being anti-China and anti-Chinese to the people of the world.

    At a rally jointly held by the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese today, Wu Yuheng, the father of Wu Pengde, a staff member of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, and a returned overseas Chinese, angrily accused the Indonesian right-wing organization's armed thugs of beating and kidnapping his son and other personnel in the consulate dormitory. He said that the actions of the Indonesian right-wing military clique violated the privileges of our diplomatic missions and trampled on international law. The Indonesian government has an unshirkable responsibility for this blatant and barbaric atrocity. Sun Zhiqin, a returned overseas Chinese who taught at the Kapok Overseas Chinese School in Central Java, Indonesia, for twenty years, accused the Indonesian right-wing group of burning down the Kapok Overseas Chinese School's school buildings and robbing and burning the overseas Chinese shops there. Wen Manhun, vice chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and chairman of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and Lin Dachuan, vice chairman of the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, expressed their firm support for the note of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission on behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. They pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' frantic persecution of overseas Chinese is to cater to the needs of US imperialism, deliberately undermine the relationship between China and Indonesia, and undermine the unity of the two peoples in the anti-imperialist struggle. No matter what excuses they make, they cannot cover up this despicable conspiracy. They warned the Indonesian government: The heinous crimes you have committed and the blood debts you owe, the Indonesian people and the people of the world will definitely rise up and settle accounts with you. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will never ignore your crimes of cruelly persecuting overseas Chinese.

    各地归国华侨继续集会声讨印尼右派迫害华侨暴行
    毛泽东时代的伟大中国人民是不可侮的  印尼右派充当美帝反华走卒必加速灭亡
    据新华社上海二十一日电  上海市各界归国华侨二十日举行集会，愤怒声讨印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的法西斯暴行，坚决拥护我国外交部的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明。
    各界归侨在会上严正警告印度尼西亚政府：毛泽东时代的人民是不可侮的。你们为迎合美帝国主义的需要，在大举反共、反人民的同时，掀起反华排华的狂暴逆流，只能暴露你们充当美帝国主义反华走卒的丑恶面目，只能加速你们走向灭亡。
    上海“五好”工人周秀丽控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒杀害她父亲和弟弟的暴行。她说：“现在，我母亲和四个弟妹无依无靠、生活无着。我家周围的华侨邻居和其他地方的华侨亲戚，许多人也遭到蹂躏和迫害，有的被肢解、剖腹，有的被抛入河中淹死，其凶惨达到骇人听闻的地步。”她说，这真是无耻之极，印度尼西亚右派反动势力血债累累，世界人民都看得清清楚楚，是无论如何也抵赖不了的。
    上海市归国华侨联合会主席黄钦书在会上作了书面发言。他坚决要求印度尼西亚政府对我国政府照会迅速作出圆满的答复，并立即停止迫害华侨的暴行，释放全部被捕被禁华侨，保证自愿返国华侨的安全，不得阻挠我国派船接侨的工作。
    上海市归国华侨联合会副主席刘良模在发言中指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂排华反华，是美帝国主义策划的反共、反华、反人民阴谋的一部分。他说，我们要正告帝国主义和一切反动派：中国人民受人宰割的时代早已过去了。帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派妄图阻止中国前进，就象螳螂挡车，定被历史的车轮碾得粉碎。世界上所有的反华“英雄”，决不会有什么好下场。
    据新华社二十一日讯　南宁、昆明、天津、武汉、长春、长沙、杭州等地的归国华侨昨天和今天分别举行集会，声讨印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的法西斯暴行。他们表示坚决拥护我国外交部五月十八日致印度尼西亚驻华大使馆的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明，并且严正要求印度尼西亚政府对我国外交部的照会早日作出圆满的答复。
    广西壮族自治区和南宁市的归国华侨联合会二十日联合举行集会。有十七名印度尼西亚归国华侨在会上控诉了印度尼西亚右派反动势力惨杀和迫害他们亲人的罪行。华侨事务委员会副主任李任仁在会上作了书面发言。他指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华、排华的暴行绝对损害不了伟大的中华人民共和国在全世界的强大威望，只能暴露印度尼西亚右派反动势力充当美帝国主义走卒的丑恶面目。他对在印度尼西亚受害的华侨表示亲切的慰问，并向即将回国的受害侨胞表示热烈的欢迎。归侨黄印发在会上控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒抢光了他家的财物后，又把他的父母抓进监牢关了四十天。为了封锁消息，右派当局还对被捕的华侨进行威胁。黄印发警告印度尼西亚右派说：革命的中国人民从来是不畏强暴的，双手沾满印度尼西亚人民和华侨鲜血的印度尼西亚反动派，决不会有好下场。在印度尼西亚侨居了三十九年的自治区归国华侨联合会副主席潘清启说，雅加达的“红溪”河，就是因为印度尼西亚人民和中国侨民在共同抗击荷兰殖民者的战斗中血流成河而得名的。印度尼西亚的石油矿、锡矿和橡胶园、胡椒园里，也都浇淋着华侨的血汗。他说，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民在历史上就有着友好合作的关系，这种关系是印度尼西亚右派反动势力所破坏不了的。
    云南省和昆明市的归国华侨联合会二十日举行了集会。云南省归国华侨联合会主席、昆明市副市长王昭明在会上指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力的排华暴行，充分暴露了他们充当美帝国主义刽子手的狰狞面目。汽车工人李德富说，他的亲人在印度尼西亚从事农业生产，和当地人民友好相处。但不久前印度尼西亚右派反动势力竟野蛮地绑架了他的嫂嫂和侄儿，他们至今生死不明。他说：印度尼西亚右派反动势力的这些法西斯暴行，吓不倒解放了的中国人民，也吓不倒有强大社会主义祖国做靠山的华侨，你们做尽了坏事，决不能逃脱历史的惩罚。
    在天津市归国华侨今天举行的集会上，天津拖拉机制造厂技术员吕煜青控诉说，印度尼西亚右派暴徒不但凶恶地打伤了他的母亲，还八次洗劫了他的家，抢劫、捣毁了所有的财物。他在会上拿出家中被洗劫后拍摄的两张照片激愤地说，华侨再也不是一九四九年以前的“海外孤儿”，再也不是任人宰割的羔羊了。反动派越猖狂，越说明他们是虚弱的，离他们灭亡的日子也就越近。被印度尼西亚右派暴徒杀害了叔父的天津大学学生谢建章，家中房屋财物被右派暴徒焚烧、抢掠一空的归侨学生许素明，以及医师谢懋侃、工人林德时等人，在会上指出，中国人民对武装到牙齿的美帝国主义都不放在眼里，何况印度尼西亚这一小撮右派反动势力。毛泽东时代的中国人民是不怕鬼的，世界上所有的反华“英雄”从来都没有好下场，印度尼西亚右派反动势力也决不会例外。
    湖北省归国华侨联合会主席谢心正在武汉地区归国华侨二十日举行的集会上说，印度尼西亚反动派对华侨进行骇人听闻的烧杀抢掠，其残暴手段比之于当年的希特勒有过之而无不及。家属还在印度尼西亚的武汉市蔬菜公司干部黄笃慎，愤慨地揭露了印度尼西亚右派暴徒纵火烧毁了他的家和当地许多华侨的成片房屋，迫使他父亲和大批华侨倾家荡产，流离失所。他说，我家的遭遇，就是印度尼西亚成千上万华侨的遭遇。血债必须偿还，印度尼西亚人民和我国人民决不会宽恕这些暴徒的罪行。武汉市归国华侨联合会主席侯杞新、青山修造船厂老工人罗绍森等在会上指出，反华排华的只是一小撮印度尼西亚右派分子，决不代表广大印度尼西亚人民的意志。华侨世世代代留居印度尼西亚的土地上，他们辛勤劳动，在发展印度尼西亚的民族经济和反对帝国主义、殖民主义对印度尼西亚的侵略的斗争中作出了重要的贡献，同印度尼西亚人民建立了亲密的友谊，这是有目共睹的事实。
    在长春市各界归侨二十一日上午举行的集会上，许多从印度尼西亚归来的华侨用他们亲人遭受迫害的经过，愤怒地控诉印度尼西亚右派反动势力的野蛮暴行。印度尼西亚归侨、吉林工业大学学生欧丰云揭露说：“去年十月二十五日晚和二十六日上午，印度尼西亚右派暴徒对我家和居住在周围的华侨进行残酷的抢劫和烧杀。如今，我的母亲和弟妹音讯全无，生死不明。”他说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力罪恶昭彰，不容抵赖，中国人民、印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民一定要同他们清算这笔血债。
    长沙市归国华侨在二十日举行了集会。归侨张成裕在会上激动地说：“当我听到我国政府准备派船接运受害华侨回国的消息时，我激动得流下了眼泪。我们的伟大社会主义祖国是华侨最可靠的后盾。”归侨谢莲芬、李振荣的叔父，都在不久前被印度尼西亚右派暴徒杀害，他们在会上愤怒地指出，印度尼西亚右派暴徒的法西斯暴行肯定逃脱不了人民的惩罚。全国侨联委员王谦宇在会上驳斥了印度尼西亚政府说什么华侨回国是出于中国政府的命令和政治措施的无耻谰言，他指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力对华侨的残酷迫害事实俱在，是怎样也抵赖不了的。现在湖南省文史馆工作、在印度尼西亚居住了三十一年的归侨李辉球，以及在印度尼西亚出生、长大的归侨李安光都指出，勤劳善良的印度尼西亚人民同华侨有着兄弟般的情谊，印度尼西亚政府假借人民的名义，血口喷人，正好说明他们害怕印度尼西亚人民同中国人民友好下去。他们指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华排华，是因为中国政府坚持反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派。印度尼西亚右派反动势力企图把反华排华暴行的罪责转嫁到印度尼西亚人民头上，结果只能更加把自己反华排华的反动面目暴露在全世界人民的面前。
    在浙江省侨联和杭州市侨联今天联合举行的集会上，中国驻雅加达总领事馆工作人员吴朋德的父亲、归侨吴毓衡，愤怒地控诉了印度尼西亚右派组织武装暴徒在领事馆宿舍殴打、绑架他儿子和其他人员的罪行。他说，印度尼西亚右派军人集团的所作所为，侵犯了我国外交机构的特权，蹂躏了国际法，印度尼西亚政府对这种明目张胆的野蛮暴行有不容推卸的责任。在印度尼西亚中爪哇加薄棉华侨学校任教二十年的归侨孙治钦，控诉了印度尼西亚右派集团焚毁加薄棉的华侨学校校舍、抢劫和焚烧那里华侨商店的暴行。浙江省侨联副主席、杭州市侨联主席文曼魂和杭州市侨联副主席林达川，在会上代表浙江省和杭州市侨联表示坚决拥护我国外交部的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明。他们指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨，是为了迎合美帝国主义的需要，蓄意破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国的关系，破坏两国人民在反帝斗争中的团结。不论他们制造任何借口，都掩盖不了这种卑鄙的阴谋。他们警告印度尼西亚政府说：你们的滔天罪行，你们欠下的血债，印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民一定要起来同你们清算，中国政府和中国人民对你们残酷迫害华侨的罪行，决不会置之不顾。
