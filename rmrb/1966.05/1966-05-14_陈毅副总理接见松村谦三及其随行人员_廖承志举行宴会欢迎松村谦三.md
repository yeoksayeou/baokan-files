    Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Vice Premier Chen Yi received Matsumura Kenzo, advisor to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, and his entourage this afternoon and had a friendly conversation with them. Present at the meeting were Liao Chengzhi, Hu Yuzhi, Qiao Guanhua, Nan Hanchen, Chu Tunan, and other relevant responsible persons.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Liao Chengzhi held a banquet this evening to welcome Matsumura Kenzo, advisor to the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, and his entourage.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the banquet.
    Liao Chengzhi spoke at the banquet. He said, "Today, we are holding this banquet to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Matsumura, who at the advanced age of eighty, has traveled a long distance to personally lead a delegation to Beijing for the fourth time to promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and to discuss the memorandum trade."
    He said, "As you all know, our country successfully conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials on May 9 and issued a press communique on this matter. On the same day, our news agency published Premier Zhou Enlai's four-sentence statement on China's policy toward the United States made to a reporter from the Pakistani newspaper 'Dawn' on April 10. In recent weeks, in their speeches welcoming the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu, our Party and government leaders have clarified the position of our government and people on a series of major international issues, and expressed the attitude of our people in resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. At present, our people are in the midst of a high tide of socialist construction and the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution. At a time when U.S. imperialism and the reactionary forces of Northeast Asia are trying to piece together a military alliance to 'contain' China and aim their aggression at China, we are very pleased to receive Mr. Matsumura in Beijing."
    Liao Chengzhi said, "We are pleased to hear that Mr. Matsumura told reporters in Hong Kong that when the United States and the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons and tested them, people did not say a word, but when China tested nuclear weapons, they came out to criticize it, which is unreasonable. Mr. Matsumura's attitude is very different from the official statements of the Sato government, Sato himself, and Tomisaburo Hashimoto. On May 11, we also heard from Japanese broadcasts that Mr. Yoshimi Furui said at a hearing on Chinese issues that Japan and China should actively conduct personnel exchanges without regard to the reactionary activities of some people within the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party. At the same time, we noted that Mr. Aiichiro Fujiyama also attended this hearing. We should point out that Mr. Yoshimi Furui's remarks are also very different from the Sato government's unreasonable obstruction of the visit to Japan by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation led by Comrades Hu Yuzhi and Zhao Anbo. This shows that China's friends among the Japanese people are not decreasing, but increasing."
    He said, "We sincerely hope that Mr. Matsumura's visit will make new contributions to enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and developing memorandum trade."
    Matsumura Kenzo said in his speech, "My visit to China is to discuss matters related to the Liao Chengzhi-Takasaki Tatsunosuke memorandum trade. I sincerely hope that trade relations between Japan and China will be further strengthened, and that friendly relations between the two countries will be developed through trade relations. At the same time, I also hope to develop friendly exchanges between the sports circles of Japan and China."
    Matsumura Kenzo said, "China is conducting nuclear tests. Many newspaper reporters in Japan came to ask me, and I said that Japan and China are very close to each other, and it would be bad if there were phenomena of throwing things back and forth between the two countries. But at the same time, we believe that the issue of nuclear testing should not only be criticized in China's case. Nuclear weapons should not be the exclusive possession of the Soviet Union and the United States. If only China is criticized, I think this is unreasonable."
    Matsumura Kenzo said, "Some Japanese people think that war will happen immediately, Japan should immediately revise the constitution, get together with the United States, send troops everywhere, and openly publish in newspapers that they want to develop nuclear weapons in Japan. This is a completely absurd statement. I think that Japan and China should have peaceful negotiations, which is the way to peacefully resolve world problems."
    He said, "The political systems of Japan and China are different, but one thing is common: the power of the people overwhelms everything. My visit to China has received strong support from the Japanese people. Many newspapers published editorials for my visit to China. And I am not anyone in power, but just an ordinary person. Judging from the editorials published by these newspapers, they are not sending me off, but have a desire: Sino-Japanese relations should not continue as they are now, but should be put on the right track. I believe that this hope of our people can certainly be realized. What's more, our two countries also have a common cultural foundation. This hope is shared not only by those who visited China with me, but also by many people in the Japanese Diet, and very important people. We have great confidence."
    Also present at the banquet were Hu Yuzhi, Qiao Guanhua, Nan Hanchen, Chu Tunan, Zhang Youyu, Cui Yueli, Liu Xiwu, Huan Xiang, Zhao Anbo, and other relevant responsible persons. (Attached picture)

    陈毅副总理接见松村谦三及其随行人员
    廖承志举行宴会欢迎松村谦三
    新华社十三日讯　陈毅副总理今天下午接见日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三和他的随行人员，同他们进行了友好的谈话。接见时在座的有廖承志、胡愈之、乔冠华、南汉宸、楚图南等有关方面负责人。
    新华社十三日讯　廖承志今晚举行宴会，欢迎日本自由民主党顾问松村谦三和他的随行人员。
    陈毅副总理出席了宴会。
    廖承志在宴会上讲话。他说，今天我们在这里举行宴会，对松村先生以八十高龄，不远千里亲率代表团，为增进中日两国人民友谊、商谈备忘录贸易，第四次来到北京，表示热烈的欢迎。
    他说，象诸位所知道的一样，我国于五月九日成功地进行了一次含有热核材料的核爆炸，并就此发表了新闻公报。同一天，我国新闻机关发表了周恩来总理四月十日对巴基斯坦《黎明报》记者谈的关于中国对美国政策的四句话。最近十多天以来，我国党政领导人在欢迎以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的历次讲话中，阐明了我国政府和人民对一系列重大国际问题的立场，表示了我国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的态度。目前，我国人民正处在社会主义建设和社会主义文化大革命的高潮中。在美帝国主义和东北亚各国反动派力图拼凑“遏制”中国的军事同盟并将侵略矛头对准中国的时候，我们能够在北京接待松村先生，感到十分高兴。
    廖承志说，我们高兴地听到，松村先生在香港对记者说，美国和苏联有核武器，在他们试验的时候，人们都不吭气，而在中国试验核武器的时候，就出来责难，这是不通情理的。松村先生的这一态度，是同佐藤政府、佐藤本人以及桥本登美三郎的正式发言是很不同的。五月十一日，我们又从日本广播中听到古井喜实先生在中国问题意见听取会上说，不要顾虑到日本政府、自由民主党内一部分人的反动活动，日本和中国应该积极地进行人员往来。同时，我们注意到藤山爱一郎先生也出席了这个意见听取会。我们应该指出，古井喜实先生所说的话，同佐藤政府毫无道理地阻挠胡愈之、赵安博同志率领的中国外交学会代表团访日的态度，也是很不同的。由此可以看出，中国在日本人民中的朋友，不是日渐减少，而是日益增多。
    他说，我们诚恳地希望，松村先生的这次访问将对增进中日两国人民的友谊和发展备忘录贸易作出新的贡献。
    松村谦三在讲话中说，我这次访问中国，是来商谈有关廖承志高碕达之助备忘录贸易问题的。我衷心希望日中两国贸易关系进一步加强，希望通过贸易关系来发展两国的友好关系。同时，还希望发展日中两国体育界的友好往来。
    松村谦三说，中国进行核试验，日本许多报纸的记者来问我，我说，日本和中国离得很近，两国之间如果发生投来投去的现象就不妙了。但是同时，我们认为，关于核试验的问题，不应该光指责中国。核武器不应该仅仅是苏联和美国的专利品。如果光指责中国，我认为这是没有道理的。
    松村谦三说，有一些日本人认为，马上就会发生战争了，日本应该立即修改宪法，和美国搞在一起，要把军队到处派出去，并公然在报纸上发表要在日本也搞核武装，这是完全岂有此理的说法。我觉得，日中两国应该和平地进行谈判，这才是和平解决世界问题的途径。
    他说，日中两国的政治形态是各不相同的，但有一点是共同的，人民的力量压倒一切。我来中国访问，就受到日本人民强烈的支持。许多报纸为我的访问中国发表社论。而我并不是任何当权的人，只不过是普通一个人。从这些报纸发表的社论来看，并不是欢送我，而是有着这样一个愿望：日中关系不应该象现在这样下去，而应该纳上正途。我相信，我国民众的这一希望，是一定可以得到实现的。更何况我们两国还有着共同文化的基础。这一希望不仅与我一同访问中国的人都有，而且，在日本国会中也有很多人、并且是很有份量的人也有。我们是有很大的信心的。
    出席宴会的，还有胡愈之、乔冠华、南汉宸、楚图南、张友渔、崔月犁、刘希文、宦乡、赵安博等有关方面负责人。（附图片）
