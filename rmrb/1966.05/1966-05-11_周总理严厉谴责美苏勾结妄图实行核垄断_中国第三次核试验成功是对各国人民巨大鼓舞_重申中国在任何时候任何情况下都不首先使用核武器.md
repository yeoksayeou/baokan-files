    Xinhua News Agency, 10th – Premier Zhou Enlai said at the banquet held by Chairman Shehu tonight that the success of China's third nuclear test is a major contribution made by the Chinese people in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on their own efforts, striving for progress, and safeguarding the security of the motherland and world peace. He said that this victory is a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are fighting heroically for their own liberation.
    Premier Zhou Enlai sternly condemned the US-Soviet collusion attempting to implement nuclear monopoly. He said that like all new weapons in history, nuclear weapons cannot be monopolized. Nuclear weapons cannot save the life of US imperialism, nor can they save the life of the Soviet revisionist leading group.
    Premier Zhou said that our development of nuclear weapons is entirely for defense, and the ultimate goal is to eliminate nuclear weapons. When China exploded its first atomic bomb, the Chinese government already clarified China's fundamental position on nuclear weapons and specifically suggested convening a summit conference of heads of state from all countries to discuss the comprehensive prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has also suggested to the United States that they undertake obligations to each other not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. However, US imperialism rejected China's proposal and continued to develop and mass-produce various nuclear weapons, and further expanded its nuclear bases around the world, especially nuclear bases around China, intensifying nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats against China and other peace-loving countries. The Soviet revisionist leading group, colluding with US imperialism, actively planned the so-called "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" in order to maintain their nuclear monopoly, intimidate oppressed nations and oppressed people, and strive to realize the dream of "US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world." Under these circumstances, China has to conduct necessary and limited nuclear tests to develop nuclear weapons. The success of China's third nuclear test is undoubtedly a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are fighting heroically for their own liberation.
    Premier Zhou said that believing in nuclear weapons is one of the main characteristics of Khrushchev revisionism. They succumbed to the nuclear blackmail of US imperialism, and in turn used nuclear weapons to blackmail others. They thought that as long as there were nuclear weapons, all the problems in the world could be solved. This is an extremely erroneous and reactionary view. Like all new weapons in history, nuclear weapons cannot be monopolized. Any reactionary force is doomed to perish, no matter what new weapons it possesses. Nuclear weapons cannot save the life of US imperialism, nor can they save the life of the Soviet revisionist leading group.
    Premier Zhou said that China is developing nuclear weapons, but it absolutely does not believe in nuclear weapons. We will never succumb to anyone's nuclear blackmail, nor will we use nuclear weapons to blackmail anyone. Just as we did during the first two nuclear tests, this time we reiterate that China will never, under any circumstances, be the first to use nuclear weapons. We firmly believe that as long as all peace-loving people and countries in the world work together and persist in the struggle, nuclear war can be prevented and nuclear weapons can be completely prohibited.

    周总理严厉谴责美苏勾结妄图实行核垄断
    中国第三次核试验成功是对各国人民巨大鼓舞
    重申中国在任何时候任何情况下都不首先使用核武器
    新华社十日讯　周恩来总理今晚在谢胡主席举行的宴会上说，中国第三次核试验的成功，是中国人民高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，自力更生，奋发图强，为保卫祖国的安全和世界和平作出的一项重大贡献。他说，这一胜利对正在争取自己的解放而英勇斗争的各国人民，是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    周恩来总理严厉谴责美苏勾结妄图实行核垄断。他说，象历史上所有的新武器一样，核武器是垄断不了的。核武器既救不了美帝国主义的命，也救不了苏联修正主义领导集团的命。
    周总理说，我们发展核武器，完全是为了防御，最终目的是为了消灭核武器。在中国爆炸第一颗原子弹的时候，中国政府就已经阐明了中国对核武器的根本立场，并且具体建议召开世界各国首脑会议，讨论全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器。中国还曾向美国建议，彼此承担义务，相互不首先使用核武器。但是，美帝国主义拒绝了中国的建议，继续发展和大量生产各种核武器，并且进一步扩大它在全世界的核基地，特别是在中国周围的核基地，加紧对中国和其他爱好和平的国家进行核讹诈和核威胁。苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义勾结在一起，积极策划所谓“防止核扩散”条约，借以保持他们的核垄断地位，恫吓被压迫民族和被压迫人民，力图实现“苏美合作主宰世界”的迷梦。在这种情况下，中国不能不进行必要的和有限制的核试验，来发展核武器。中国第三次核试验的成功，对于正在争取自己的解放而英勇斗争的各国人民，无疑是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    周总理说，迷信核武器是赫鲁晓夫修正主义的主要特征之一。他们屈服于美帝国主义的核讹诈，又用核武器去讹诈旁人。他们以为，只要有了核武器，世界上的一切问题都可以解决了。这是一个极端错误的反动观点。象历史上所有的新武器一样，核武器是垄断不了的。任何反动力量都是要灭亡的，不管它掌握了什么新武器。核武器既救不了美帝国主义的命，也救不了苏联修正主义领导集团的命。
    周总理说，中国发展核武器，但绝不迷信核武器。我们绝不会在任何人的核讹诈面前屈服，也绝不会拿核武器去讹诈任何人。正如同前两次进行核试验时一样，这一次我们重申，中国在任何时候、任何情况下，都不首先使用核武器。我们深信，只要全世界一切爱好和平的人民和国家共同努力，坚持斗争，核战争是可以防止的，核武器是完全可以禁止的。
