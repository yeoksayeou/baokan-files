    Foster Whose Ambition, Extinguish Whose Prestige
    Former Chinese People's Volunteer Army Second-Class Hero, Special-Class Meritorious Individual Wang Yanlin
    Thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings and my own experiences, and then thinking about the film "Red Sun," the more I think about it, the angrier I get. We cannot allow the film to unscrupulously beautify the enemy, foster the enemy's ambition, distort our people's army, and extinguish our prestige.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they don't have much strength." Fourteen years ago, I personally dealt with the master of the Kuomintang reactionaries – American imperialism – and poked holes all over this paper tiger. In just one counterattack at the Shangganling 537.7 Heights, I and five new soldiers killed and captured more than 270 American devils and destroyed 18 bunkers, while suffering no casualties ourselves. If the master is like this, then the Kuomintang reactionaries are even less of a match for us. During the Liberation War, our army, relying on the courage and wisdom that the great Mao Zedong Thought gave us, with the spirit of not fearing hardship, not fearing death, daring to struggle, and daring to win, achieved invincibility. In just over three years, we buried the Jiang family dynasty!
    However, the directors of the film "Red Sun" seriously obliterate this eloquent historical fact, portraying Zhang Lingfu, the master of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the commander of the 74th Division, as a "tenacious and good fighter," "calm and decisive," and "unyielding to the death" "hero." And they uglify the broad masses of commanders and fighters of our army beyond recognition: the military's morale is scattered, morale is low, anxiety and restlessness pervade the entire army, superiors yell at subordinates at every turn, dizzy-headed in victory, and discouraged in "failure." Not to mention anything else, just at the beginning of the film, the sacrifice of Su Guoying, the commander of the 58th Regiment, and our army's "forced" withdrawal from Lianshui, everyone is mentally exhausted, and even the army commander Shen Zhenxin is worried and at a loss. However, the enemy's 74th Division marched straight in, invincible; Zhang Lingfu, wearing a cloak, was even more arrogant and prestigious. Isn't this fostering the enemy's prestige and extinguishing our army's ambition! After our army completed the encirclement plan of Menglianggu and took Duozhuang, the important base for the 74th Division's supplies, Zhang Lingfu was already a turtle in a jar, but the film still depicts him as "calm" and "composed," smugly waiting for their reinforcements to arrive, performing his "blooming from the inside." Even when food and ammunition were exhausted, his set of counter-revolutionary tactics of "feinting to the east and attacking the west" still "scared" our army commander Shen into taking out a handkerchief to wipe the cold sweat from his face. Finally, although the film ends with the victory of our army, the directors tell us: Zhang Lingfu did not fail the "cultivation" of his American masters and was worthy of being a counter-revolutionary "hero." When he died, he was still wearing a steel helmet and holding an automatic gun to resist to the end!
    "Red Sun" is a poisonous arrow aimed at our great Party, our great people, and our great army. We want to solemnly tell the directors that your shameful political attempts will never succeed, and the facts of history cannot be distorted.

### 长谁的志气　灭谁的威风

    长谁的志气　灭谁的威风
    前中国人民志愿军二级英雄、特等功臣　王彦林
    想想毛主席的教导和自己的亲身经历，再想想《红日》这部影片，我越想越气愤。我们不能容许影片肆无忌惮地美化敌人，长敌人的志气，歪曲我们人民军队，灭我们的威风。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”十四年前，我亲身和国民党反动派的主子——美帝国主义打过交道，把这个纸老虎戳了个周身窟窿。仅上甘岭五三七点七高地一次反击，我和五个新战士就打死和活捉了二百七十多个美国鬼，炸毁了十八个地堡，而自己无一伤亡。主子尚且如此，国民党反动派就更不是我们的对手。解放战争时期，我军靠着伟大的毛泽东思想给我们的勇敢和智慧，以一不怕苦，二不怕死，敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，作到了攻无不克，战无不胜，三年多时间，就埋葬了蒋家王朝！
    然而，影片《红日》的编导者却严重地抹煞了这一雄辩的历史事实，把美帝国主义的奴才——国民党反动派七十四师师长张灵甫刻划成一个“顽强善战”、“沉着果断”、“宁死不屈”的“英雄”；而把我军的广大指战员丑化得不象样子：军心涣散，士气低落，忧虑和烦躁笼罩全军，上级对下级动不动就熊，胜利时昏头昏脑，“失败”时灰心丧气。别的不说，单说影片一开始，五十八团团长苏国英牺牲，我军“被迫”撤离涟水，个个精神疲惫，甚至连军长沈振新也是忧虑重重，一筹莫展；而敌军七十四师却长驱直入，不可一世；穿着披风的张灵甫更是趾高气扬，威风得很。这不是在长敌人的威风，灭我军的志气吗！在我军完成孟良崮的包围计划并拿下了七十四师的辎重、给养重地垛庄后，张灵甫已成瓮中之鳖，但影片还在描写他“镇静”、“沉着”，洋洋得意地等着他们援军赶到，表演他的“中心开花”。即使到了粮尽弹绝的时候，他那套“声东击西”的反革命战术，还“吓”得我沈军长掏出手帕擦擦脸上的冷汗。最后，影片虽以我军的胜利为结局，但编导者告诉我们：张灵甫并没有辜负美国主子的“栽培”、不愧是反革命的“英雄”，临死时，他还头戴钢盔，手执自动枪顽抗到底呢！
    《红日》是一支射向我们伟大的党、伟大的人民、伟大的军队的毒箭。我们要正告编导者，你们可耻的政治企图是永远不会得逞的，历史的事实也是歪曲不了的。
