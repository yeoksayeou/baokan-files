    My Eight Years
    Jie Yue, Fine Spinning Worker, Taiyuan Textile Factory

    I entered the factory in 1958 and have been there for eight years now.

    I was only sixteen years old when I joined the factory, and to be honest, I was still a child. However, I really like 1958, and I always love to recall it. In that year, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. In that year, the people of the whole country launched the vigorous Great Leap Forward. Also in that year, I put on the clothes of a textile worker, joined the ranks of the working class, and the Party and Chairman Mao planted a red root in my mind, making me firmly remember these words in my heart: Go all out for the revolution forever, aim high, break down superstitions, and dare to think and dare to act! Now, whenever I think of 1958, I feel warmth in my heart and inexhaustible energy throughout my body.

    My eight years are eight years of the Party's cultivation and education, eight years in which Mao Zedong Thought began to take root in my mind, and also eight years in which I ideologically waged a struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. In these eight years, our country experienced the Three Years of Great Leap Forward, Three Years of Adjustment, and Two Years of Continued Leap Forward. I call this situation the nationwide big "3-3-2." Looking back at my own situation over the past eight years, there is also a small "3-3-2."

    Now, I will talk about my own "3-3-2."

    The Three Years of Great Leap Forward planted a red root in my heart: Go all out for the revolution forever, aim high, break down superstitions, and dare to think and dare to act. Whenever I couldn't move forward, I thought of the experience of the Great Leap Forward. Thinking of the Great Leap Forward, my enthusiasm came up: If I have the conditions, I will move forward; if I don't have the conditions, I will create the conditions to move forward!

    In 1958, on the first day I entered the factory gate, I saw a big red banner that said: Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. After entering the factory, the veteran workers told us, "Our factory will soon be up and running, and all 80,000 spindles will be opened, just waiting for you to come!" The leaders also encouraged us to dare to think and dare to act, learn well from the masters, and strive to get on the job quickly and watch more spindles. What I saw and heard was all about the Great Leap Forward. At that time, although I didn't understand the great significance of the Great Leap Forward, I just felt happy and energetic, eager to master the technology immediately and start spinning right away. This was my mood, and it was also the wish of the new workers who entered the factory at that time. The leadership understood our mood and wishes, and after more than a month of political study, and after initially learning how to join threads and change yarns technically, they officially let us watch the machines.

    It is said that according to the "regular" method, new workers need three to six months of technical training before they can get on the machines. However, at that time, the factory leaders did not follow the "regular" procedures, but explained to us the great significance of the Great Leap Forward, and then let us work on the machines in practice, learning while doing, doing while learning, breaking through while learning, and creating while learning.

    On the first day I went to the machines, I watched one hundred spindles. After getting off work, I felt dissatisfied, feeling that I hadn't used up my energy. I asked the master if I could watch more. Our master happily agreed and said: You watch two hundred spindles tomorrow!

    The next day, I really watched two hundred spindles. During work, the master ran over to look at me, looked for a long time, and she asked strangely: Why do you use both your left and right hands to do cleaning work at the same time? I said: It's more efficient this way. She said: The left hand can't be used. I asked her: Then what does the left hand do when it's idle? This time, the master laughed. Later, I learned that the operating procedure stipulates that cleaning work can only be done from right to left with the right hand, and cannot be done from left to right with the left hand. Because I didn't quite understand the operating procedures and had no restrictions, I broke through with "using both hands simultaneously."

    After two days, I felt that watching two hundred spindles still didn't use up all my energy. I asked the master again if I could add more spindles. She thought for a while and said, "Adding another two hundred spindles would be one whole machine. You'd have to go around in a circle, can you handle it?" Turning in circles involves more problems, so it seems the master was a little worried. I quickly suggested, "Can I watch four hundred spindles in one alley of machines?" Watching four hundred spindles in one alley doesn't require leaving the alley, doesn't require turning in circles, and can provide comprehensive care. However, splitting the front machine and assigning two hundred spindles to me, and then splitting the back machine and assigning two hundred spindles to me, allowing me to focus on watching four hundred spindles in one alley, this is another irregular practice. Therefore, my suggestion made the master laugh again. She looked at me happily and surprisingly, as if to say: Why do you always break into these irregular ways!? I was afraid that the master would not agree to my request. Who knew, she liked it very much and said: Okay, let's do as you say!

    The leadership allowed us to come to the machines to practice, learn, and break through in a practical way. As a result, within a few days, some non-"regular" things were broken through. Were these non-"regular" things good or bad? At the time, it felt very good, but I couldn't explain the reason. Later, from studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood that the Great Leap Forward broke the old framework of training new workers, allowing them to undergo short-term political training and then get on the machines to practice, learning while doing, and doing while learning, which was really very good.

    First, letting us go to the machines to break through is in line with Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao said when summarizing the experience of the Second Revolutionary Civil War: "Learn warfare through warfare - this is our main method." I think this instruction not only applies to warfare, but also to economic construction, and also to our textile workers learning operating technology. Learn construction through construction, learn operation through operation, this is also the main method for us to engage in economic construction and learn operating technology.

    Second, learning operation through operation, without frameworks and without being bound, can give full play to creativity. Therefore, the "using both hands simultaneously" for cleaning work was broken through, and the bold practice of watching four hundred spindles in one alley was broken through; Initially, "using both hands simultaneously" for cleaning work paved the way for the current use of both hands for cleaning work. Initially, the bold practice of watching four hundred spindles in one alley consolidated and improved the ability to watch spindles, laying the foundation for continuing to expand the number of spindles watched in the future.

    During the Three Years of Great Leap Forward, the workers had great enthusiasm and dared to break through and create, and the cadres also had great enthusiasm and dared to think and dare to act. They followed the shifts, not only the first shift, the second shift, but also the night shift. They endured hardships first and enjoyed comforts later; when working, they led us in front; when we were thirsty, they brought us boiled water; when we were having supplemental meals, they brought us hot meals. The workers admired them from the bottom of their hearts and praised them.

    With the help and support of the cadres, I felt that my daring to break through became even greater. One day, I went to the cafeteria for dinner and saw a big red poster posted at the entrance, praising the new worker Li Yajie for watching six hundred spindles. I immediately found the master and asked to watch six hundred spindles as well. The master and cadres supported my request, and in this way, on the tenth day of getting on the machines, I watched six hundred spindles.

    This incident awakened me. I thought, to move forward, you must have an opponent. Find an opponent, discover your own shortcomings, and push forward, so that you can run faster. Therefore, in the process of watching six hundred spindles, I looked for opponents among the new workers who entered the factory at the same time as me. But after searching and searching, only Li Yajie and I were watching six hundred spindles. At this time, I thought: To leap forward, you must get out of the circle of new workers, look upwards, and catch up upwards. In this way, I quickly selected Comrade Fan Guoying, who entered the factory half a month earlier than me. At that time, she was watching eight hundred spindles, so I learned from her and tried my best to catch up with her. As a result, with the support of the master and cadres, I watched eight hundred spindles after being on the machines for more than twenty days.

    After catching up with Comrade Fan Guoying, I spurred myself to find an opponent at an even higher level. At this time, the leader enlightened me and said, "Do you dare to break through to one thousand spindles?" I said without hesitation:
  "Dare!" Watching one thousand spindles is the level of a veteran worker. However, with the support of the master and leader, I really broke through to one thousand spindles!

    Right on the front line of the Great Leap Forward, I joined the Communist Youth League.

    The Three Years of Great Leap Forward broke through achievements and gained rich experience. However, things are always divided into two, with both achievements and shortcomings. The Great Leap Forward gave me the exercise of daring to think and daring to act, and gave me a kind of daring to break through, but at that time I did not use this daring to break through well, lacked a pragmatic and realistic scientific attitude, and the work of exploring objective laws did not keep up. Therefore, the ability to watch spindles increased, but the quality of fine yarn did not improve.

    Why was there only a spirit of breaking through and a lack of a scientific attitude? There are three reasons: First, I did not consciously study Chairman Mao's works, so it was impossible to fully understand the spirit of the General Line, paying attention to "more" and "faster" but neglecting "better" and "more economical"; Second, there was individualism and unwillingness to accept defeat. In the process of catching up with the advanced, I did not proceed from "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, but adopted a wrong attitude of "you are fast, I am also fast"; Third, I did not understand the objective laws of things, and my technical skills were not yet strong enough.

    The Three Years of Adjustment allowed me to see the two sides of myself. The Three Years of Adjustment created conditions for me to overcome my shortcomings.

    During the Three Years of Adjustment, with the education and help of the Party and comrades, I gradually increased my awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works and began to understand that iron cannot become steel without being tempered, and that workers cannot grow healthily without studying Chairman Mao's works. During the three years, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, I began to wage a struggle against my own individualistic thoughts and initially recognized and mastered the objective laws of spinning.

    In response to the shortcomings of the Three Years of Great Leap Forward, I had some new awareness in three aspects during the Three Years of Adjustment.

    First, under the enlightenment and education of the leaders, I understood the truth that iron cannot become steel without being tempered, and that workers cannot grow healthily without studying Chairman Mao's works, and I improved my awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works.

    During the three years, I read through Volumes I to III of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and some articles, such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice," were read repeatedly more than ten times. By 1963, I had developed the habit of insisting on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. I felt that if I didn't read Chairman Mao's books for a day, it was like not eating, and I felt insufficient energy, a lack of methods, and I couldn't withstand difficulties and would take the wrong path.

    Second, my awareness of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform my individualistic thoughts was improved, and I was determined to fight against individualistic unwillingness to accept defeat and establish revolutionary unwillingness to accept defeat.

    I am a stubborn person. Whenever I encounter things that I am not as good at as others, I am always unwilling to accept defeat in my heart. Therefore, individualistic unwillingness to accept defeat and revolutionary unwillingness to accept defeat often fought in my head. Since studying Chairman Mao's works, revolutionary unwillingness to accept defeat has gradually gained the upper hand and overwhelmed individualistic unwillingness to accept defeat.

    Comrade Li Guiying, a master worker in the same workshop as me, has very strong technical skills. Her thread joining speed is fast, reaching twenty threads per minute. As for me, it was only nineteen threads per minute, one thread less than her. In principle, I should learn from Master Li. However, at first, I thought unwillingly: I just won't learn from your experience, and I will surpass you no matter what. In this way, I desperately practiced my technique. Walking on the road, sitting in the dormitory, lying in bed, my hands were always moving, either practicing breaking threads or practicing the action of winding shrimp rice screws. I was determined to surpass Master Li Guiying. Strangely, no matter how hard I tried, it was always nineteen threads, and I couldn't surpass Master Li no matter what.

    The branch secretary saw that I was troubled and talked to me. I told him all the details of catching up with Master Li. After listening, he asked me to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and look for strength and methods from within.

    After getting off work, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In the past, I had studied this article. This time when I studied it again, I felt particularly close, especially the sentence "One thing before you, always consider yourself first," it seemed as if Chairman Mao was talking to me.

    Putting down the book, I thought carefully: To surpass Master Li, it is in order not to be a mediocre person in the revolutionary ranks, therefore, it cannot be said that I have no intention of serving the revolution at all; however, this is mixed with many personal thoughts, and I always feel that others have run to the front, received praise from the workshop, and I am about the same as her, so I am not praised, and I am unwilling to accept defeat; I believe that the progress and achievements of comrades make me unable to receive praise, and I hold my breath and must surpass her. Who is this ultimately for? Isn't it for myself! What kind of heart is this ultimately? Isn't it a selfish heart!

    Compared with Bethune, my non-proletarian thoughts were revealed.

    After reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I reread "Serve the People." Chairman Mao said:
  "We are all from all corners of the country and have come together for a common revolutionary goal." I had read this sentence in the past, but now when I read it, I felt that it solved the problem very well. I thought, Master Li Guiying is my class sister, my comrade. I have misunderstood her; her improving the thread joining speed is to spin more yarn for the revolution, but I regard her as a rival for fame and profit, only allowing myself to overwhelm others and not allowing others to surpass myself. The more I thought about it, the more I felt my heart pounding and my face burning, and the more I felt sorry for my class sister.

    It is wrong to surpass the advanced for personal reasons. I am not willing to give up my ambition to surpass the advanced and be a mediocre person. What should I do? According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I put down the burden of surpassing the advanced for personal reasons and firmly established my determination to surpass the advanced for the revolution.

    After the ideological problem was resolved, I quickly caught up with Master Li Guiying again. At this time, what I thought was not to overwhelm her, but to catch up with and surpass the advanced level she had created. At this time, the method I adopted was not to hold my breath and desperately practice alone, but to take her as my teacher and seriously learn from her experience.

    After a period of study, I not only mastered Master Li's experience, but also discovered in my study that her winding of shrimp rice screws had a large circle, which wasted time. I told Master Li about the problem I discovered and asked her to pay attention to it during operation. At the same time, I looked for ways to overcome it in my own practice and told her about my experience. In this way, my thread joining speed quickly exceeded twenty threads.

    From this incident, I deeply realized that with Mao Zedong Thought, one is invincible, and without Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot move a single step.

    Later, from "On Contradiction," I further understood that within any thing, there is a struggle of opposing sides; under certain conditions, the opposing sides will, after struggle, defeat each other and transform into each other. I thought carefully, and Chairman Mao taught us that this principle just illustrates the process of me catching up with Master Li Guiying. When I first wanted to surpass Master Li, there was a struggle of opposing sides in my mind, that is, the struggle between individual heroism and revolutionary heroism. In the struggle, I studied Chairman Mao's works, and with Mao Zedong Thought as the best weapon, I promoted the victory of revolutionary heroism over individual heroism. In this way, I put down the burden of surpassing for personal reasons and firmly established my confidence in surpassing for the revolution. This made individualistic unwillingness to accept defeat begin to turn into revolutionary unwillingness to accept defeat.

    Third, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, I became aware of exploring the objective laws of spinning.

    At first, I thought that I had not mastered the thread joining method well, so I desperately practiced the thread joining method. No matter how I practiced, it was always ineffective, and bumps still appeared. At this time, on the one hand, I thought about working hard to victory, and on the other hand, there was a shadow of fear of failure in my heart.

    Why do bumps always appear? With this question, I studied Chairman Mao's works again.

    Chairman Mao said: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to get the desired result, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice."

    Chairman Mao's teachings brightened my heart. I thought, thread joining is also like this, it also has its own laws. If you don't recognize the laws of thread joining and don't act according to the laws, how can you not have bumps!

    In order to explore the objective laws of thread joining, after getting off work, I watched by other people's machines, watching for several hours, forgetting to eat, forgetting the fatigue after getting off work. After seeing the experience of others, I practiced hard, and the yarn pulled a bloody cut on my finger, but I did not stop practicing.

    In this way, I successively absorbed the experience of more than thirty comrades. However, it is not enough to just learn from the experience of others. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I also used my own practice to test the experience of others, absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is unique to myself, and repeatedly conducted experiments.

      During the "training," I compared and experimented with the four directions of sending yarn: sending from the right, sending from the left, sending flat, and sending straight. The results of the experiment showed that although "sending straight" still had weaknesses, it was relatively smooth. I absorbed useful experience from the existing thread joining methods and the operations of my comrades to help "sending straight" eliminate weaknesses and continuously improve it. In this way, with the great help of the leaders and comrades, while absorbing the experience of others, I added my own experience in practice and summarized the "align the sliver and gently support upwards" thread joining method, basically achieving bump-free thread joining.

    The Three Years of Great Leap Forward gained rich experience. The Three Years of Adjustment summarized the experience. At this time, a new high tide of production appeared in the country, and the factory Party committee put forward the call to increase production without increasing the number of people. I was extremely excited and determined to "stand out" for the revolution. However, I was sometimes afraid of "standing out" in my mind.

    The result of the struggle between the two thoughts of wanting to "stand out" and being afraid of "standing out" made me clarify some principles and gain some correct understanding:

    "Standing out" will inevitably expose shortcomings, which is an objective law. Things are always like this. Staying at the original level, if you do what you are familiar with, it is not easy to see problems and rarely goes wrong. As long as you leap to a higher level, there will be more unfamiliar things, and it is easy to expose problems and inevitably go wrong. However, overcoming shortcomings and correcting mistakes is progress. Therefore, "standing out" and exposing shortcomings and making mistakes are normal and good things.

    "Standing out" will inevitably receive the attention of the masses, which is an objective law. With the masses paying attention, many eyes are watching a "frontrunner," looking carefully and thoughtfully, and will find shortcomings that you cannot see and will offer opinions that you cannot think of. This is the love and supervision of the masses for the "frontrunner." Therefore, after "standing out," more people will care about you and give you advice, which is normal and a good thing.

      "Standing out" will inevitably disrupt the old order and destroy the old balance, which is also an objective law. If you make revolution, others must also make revolution. If the old order is disrupted, a new order can be established. If the old balance is destroyed, a new balance can be reorganized. In this way, one wave pushes another, and our revolutionary cause can be continuously pushed forward. Therefore, "standing out" to disrupt the old order and destroy the old balance is normal and a good thing.

    After clarifying these principles and gaining these correct understandings, I felt that whether or not to dare to "stand out" is essentially a big question of whether or not to dare to make revolution, whether or not to dare to pay the price for the revolution, and whether or not to dare to fight down the "I" character. Therefore, I made up my mind that I must "stand out"!

    In March of last year, the number of spindles I was watching increased from one thousand two to one thousand six.

    This was my first "standing out" after the Three Years of Adjustment.

    From the process of this "standing out," I initially realized that it was different from the Three Years of Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1960. The most important thing is that a "steady" character was added, a "good" character was highlighted, and attention was paid to combining work and rest. From the time I expanded the platform and the number of spindles in March until early July, after more than four months of experiments and practice, the factory organized and led the expansion of the platform and the number of spindles. Although there were some shortcomings in the expansion of the platform and the number of spindles, the achievements were affirmative. Those who "stood out" in production in the factory were not just me, but dozens or hundreds, so that the production level of the entire factory was newly improved.

    Naturally, not only were some people afraid at that time that I would "fly" up and then fall down, but even now there are still some people who doubt whether I can watch one thousand six hundred spindles. Some were afraid that I would be too busy and exhausted, and others were afraid that watching too many spindles would affect the quality. In general, I know that they are all well-intentioned, and they are also caring about me and helping me. In fact, after expanding the platform and the number of spindles, I did expose some shortcomings that could not be exposed before expanding the platform and the number of spindles. Before expanding the number of spindles, I watched one thousand two hundred spindles very easily, and I could even read newspapers during work. In the first few days after expanding the number of spindles, I felt very busy and nervous, the patrol route was disrupted, the number of broken threads increased, and the amount of cleaning work increased.

    What should I do? I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and other articles again. Chairman Mao's teachings made my heart clear, my eyes bright, my courage strong, and my backbone hard. I thought to myself, to "stand out," you cannot be afraid of exposing the shortcomings in the process of advancing, and to make revolution, you cannot be afraid of hardship, difficulty, and danger. At this time, the master worker also encouraged me and said, "No one has ever watched one thousand six hundred spindles in the past. Haven't we all studied 'On Practice'? With practice, you can boldly summarize your own practical experience and create a new patrol method for one thousand six hundred spindles." Hearing this encouragement full of class friendship, I felt energetic all over and thought to myself, since others have not created a ready-made patrol route for one thousand six hundred spindles for me, then I will follow Chairman Mao's instructions and find it out in the process of practice!

    After a period of effort, with the help of the leaders and comrades, I summarized the patrol method for one thousand six hundred spindles, further improved the cleaning work, and improved the speed and quality of thread joining, so that the new problems exposed after "standing out" began to be solved. In this way, it changed from a new passive state to a new active state, and began to master the new initiative in the case of watching one thousand six hundred spindles. Last year, my annual yarn production alone exceeded one thousand kilograms; the consumption of white flowers (roller skin flowers) was reduced by three thousand three hundred and twenty-eight taels, the cleaning score reached 99.91 points throughout the year, the average operation score was 98.44 points, the attendance rate was 100%, and I achieved safety without accidents.

    Now, a new one dividing into two is in front of me again: I have made some progress in thought, but compared with my comrades, there is still a big gap; I have made some progress in technology, but compared with my comrades, there is still a big gap. If you don't progress, you will fall behind, and if you progress slowly, you will also fall behind. I am constantly spurring myself: I must be like the people of Daqing, flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and transform myself into a thorough revolutionary.

    The most unforgettable thing in my life is that I saw our great leader Chairman Mao on National Day last year. I excitedly shed tears by Chairman Mao's side. At that time, I secretly swore: I will always be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. This is my oath for the rest of my life. I will intensify my study, master Mao Zedong Thought, this best weapon, and fire at my own shortcomings, constantly moving towards the summit.

专栏：

    我的八年
    太原纺织厂细纺工　解悦
    我是一九五八年进工厂的，到现在已经八年了。
    进厂那年，我才十六岁，说实在的，还是个耍孩子。不过，我非常喜欢一九五八年，我也总爱回忆一九五八年。这一年，党中央和毛主席提出了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。这一年，全国人民掀起了轰轰烈烈的大跃进。也就是在这一年，我穿上了纺织工人的衣服，走进了工人阶级的队伍，党和毛主席给我思想上栽了一个红根，使我心上牢牢地记住了这么几句话：为革命永远鼓足干劲、力争上游、破除迷信、敢想敢干！现在一想起一九五八年来，我就觉得心里热呼呼的，浑身有使不完的劲。
    我的八年，是党对我培养教育的八年，是毛泽东思想开始在我脑子里扎根的八年，也是我思想上进行兴无灭资斗争的八年。在这八年里，我们的国家经历了三年大跃进、三年调整和两年继续跃进。我把这个形势叫做全国大的“三三二”。回想我自己八年来的情况，也有个小的“三三二”。
    现在，我就谈谈自己的“三三二”。
    三年大跃进，使我心里扎了个红根：为革命永远鼓足干劲、力争上游、破除迷信、敢想敢干。每当自己上不去的时候，我就想起了大跃进的经验。一想大跃进，劲头就上来了：有条件我要上，没条件我创造条件也要上！
    一九五八年，我进工厂大门的第一天，迎头就看到了一条红红的大标语，上面写着：鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义。进了厂，老师傅们告诉我们，“咱们厂很快就要上马，八万多纱锭都要开齐，就等着你们来啦！”领导也鼓励我们，要敢想敢干，好好向师傅们学习，争取快上车，多看纱锭。看到的，听到的，都是大跃进。当时我虽然还不懂得大跃进的伟大意义，可是只觉得心里高兴，身上有劲，恨不得一下子就把技术学到手，立刻上车纺纱。这是我的心情，也是当时进厂的新工人们的愿望。领导上了解了我们的心情和愿望，经过一个多月的政治学习，技术上初步学会了接头和换纱之后，就让我们正式看了车。
    听人们说，要是按照“正规”的办法，新工人需要经过三至六个月的技术训练才能上车。可是，当时厂领导没按“正规”办事，而是给我们讲清了大跃进的伟大意义之后，就让我们上车实干，在干中学，学中干，闯中学，学中创。
    头一天上车，我看一百个纱锭。下了班，我感到不满足，觉得劲儿还没使完。我问师傅，能不能再多看点。我们师傅满高兴地答应我说：你明天看二百锭！
    第二天，我真的看了二百个锭子。工作中间，师傅跑来看我，看了好大一阵，她奇怪地问：你怎么左右两只手一齐做清洁工作？我说：这样得劲。她说：左手不能干。我问她：那，左手闲着干啥？这一回，把师傅问笑了。后来，我才知道，操作法规定，做清洁工作只能用右手从右向左做，不能用左手从左向右做。因为我还不太懂得操作法，没有框框，所以闯出了个“左右开弓”。
    过了两天，我又觉得看二百锭劲儿还是没有全用上。我又问师傅，还能不能再加锭。她想了一下说：“再加二百锭，就是一部车，要转圈子，你照顾得过来吗？”转起圈来，问题比较多，看来，师傅有些担心，我赶快建议说：“让我在一个车弄里看四百锭，行吗？”在一个车弄里看四百锭，不用出车弄，不转圈子，可以全面照顾了。可是，把前一部车分开，拨二百锭给我，再把后一部车分开，拨二百锭给我，让我集中在一个车弄里看四百锭，这又是一个不正规的做法。因此，我这个建议又把师傅逗笑了。她又高兴又惊奇的看着我，好象在说：你怎么老是朝着这些非正规的门道里闯！？我害怕师傅不答应我的要求。谁知，她却非常喜欢地说：行，就照你说的干！
    领导上让我们到车上来实干、实学、实闯。结果，不几天便闯出了些不“正规”的东西来。这些不“正规”的东西好不好呢？当时感到很好，就是说不出道理来。后来从学习毛主席著作中，才懂得了大跃进中打破了培训新工人的老框框，让新工人经过短期政治训练，就上车实干，在干中学，学中干，真是好得很。
    头一条，让我们到车上去闯，这就符合毛主席的指示。毛主席在总结第二次国内革命战争的经验时说：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”我想，这个指示不仅管战争，也管经济建设，也管我们纺织工人学习操作技术　从建设学习建设，从操作学习操作，这也是我们从事经济建设和学习操作技术的主要方法。
    第二条，从操作学习操作，没有框框不受束缚，可以发挥创造性，所以，闯出了清洁工作的“左右开弓”，闯出了在一个车弄里看四百锭的大胆的作法；当初在清洁工作的“左右开弓”，为现在是双手搞清洁工作开了路，当初一个车弄里看四百锭的大胆作法，巩固和提高了看锭能力，为以后继续扩大看锭打下了基础。
    三年大跃进，工人干劲大，敢闯敢创，干部的干劲也很大，也是敢想敢干。他们跟班劳动，不仅跟头班，跟二班，还要跟夜班。他们吃苦在先，享受在后；干活的时候，他们在前面领着我们干；我们口渴的时候，他们给端来开水；我们补餐的时候，他们给送来热腾腾的饭菜。工人们打心眼里佩服他们，称赞他们。
    在干部们的帮助和支持下，我觉得自己闯劲更大了。有一天，我去食堂吃饭，见门口贴着一张红红的大字报，表扬新工人李雅杰看到了六百个纱锭。我马上就找师傅，要求让我也看六百锭。师傅和干部们支持了我的要求，就这样，在上车的第十天，我就看到了六百锭。
    这件事，把我点醒了，我想，要前进，就得有对手，找到对手，发现自己的不足，骠上干，才能跑得更快。因此，看六百锭的过程中，我就在和我同时入厂的新工人当中找对手。可是找来找去，还是只有李雅杰和我看六百锭。这时候，我就想：要跃进，就得走出新工人的圈子，向上找，往上赶。就这样，很快选中了比我早进厂半个月的樊果英同志。当时，她看八百锭，我就向她学习，拼命追她，结果在师傅和干部们的支持下，我上车二十多天，便看到了八百锭。
    赶上了樊果英同志，我又鞭策自己再往高的找对手。这时候，领导启发我说：“你敢往一千锭闯吗？”我毫无顾虑地说：
  “敢！”看一千锭，是老工人的水平。但是，在师傅和领导的支持下，我真的闯上了一千锭！
    就在大跃进的火线上，我加入了共青团。
    三年大跃进，闯出了成绩，取得了丰富的经验。但是，事物总是一分为二的，既有成绩就有缺点。大跃进使我得到了敢想敢干的锻炼，使我有了一种闯劲，但是当时我还没有用好这股闯劲，缺乏实事求是的科学态度，摸索客观规律的工作没跟上去，所以，看锭能力提高了，细纱质量却没上去。
    为什么只有闯劲而缺乏科学态度呢？有三个原因：第一，没有自觉地学习毛主席的著作，所以，不可能完整地理解总路线的精神，注意了多快，忽视了好省；第二，存在着个人主义的不服气，在赶先进的过程中，不是从“完全”和“彻底”地为人民服务出发，而是采取了一种“你快我也快”的错误态度；第三，不认识事物的客观规律，技术上还不过硬。
    三年调整，使我看到了自己的一分为二。三年调整，为我克服缺点创造了条件。
    三年调整，在党和同志们的教育帮助下，使我逐步提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性，开始懂得，铁不炼不成钢，当工人不学毛主席著作不能健康成长。三年当中，按照毛主席的教导，我开始向自己思想上的个人主义展开了斗争，初步认识和掌握了纺纱的客观规律。
    针对三年大跃进中的不足，在三年调整期间，我在三个方面有了一些新的自觉。
    第一，在领导的启发和教育下，懂得了铁不炼不成钢、当工人不学毛主席著作不能健康成长的道理，提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性。
    三年时间，我通读了《毛泽东选集》一至三卷，有些文章，象《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《矛盾论》、《实践论》等，反复读了十来遍。到一九六三年，我养成了每天坚持学习毛主席著作的习惯，觉得一天不读毛主席的书，就象没有吃饭，就感到干劲不足，缺少办法，就顶不住困难，就要走错路。
    第二，用毛泽东思想改造自己个人主义思想的自觉性有了提高，决心要斗倒个人主义的不服气，树立革命的不服气。
    我是个倔拨头，凡是碰到自己不如别人的事情，心里老是不服气。因此，个人主义的不服气和革命的不服气，经常在我这脑袋里打架。自从学习了毛主席著作以后，革命的不服气才逐渐占了上风，压倒了个人主义的不服气。
    和我同在一个车间的李桂英师傅，技术很过硬，她的接头速度快，每分钟达到了二十根。我呢，每分才十九根，比她差一根。按理说，应该好好地向李师傅学习。可是，开始我不服气地想：我就是不学习你的经验，还非超过你不可。就这样，我拼命地练技术。走在路上，坐在宿舍，睡在床上，我的手总是在动弹，不是练崩头，就是练绕虾米螺丝的动作。我一心想超过李桂英师傅。也怪，怎么使劲练，总是个十九根，说啥也超不过李师傅。
    支部书记见我烦恼，就找我谈心。我把赶超李师傅的前前后后说了一通。他听了，要我学学《纪念白求恩》，从里面去寻找力量和办法。
    下了班，我就学《纪念白求恩》。过去，我学过这篇文章。这一回再学习起来感到格外亲切，特别是“一事当前，先替自己打算”这句话，好象毛主席就是针对着我说的一样。
    放下书，我细细地想：要超李师傅，为的是不叫自己在革命队伍中做一个庸庸碌碌的人，因此，不能说我一点为革命的打算也没有；但是，这里夹杂着许多个人的杂念，总是感到别人跑到前头去了，受到了车间的表扬，我和她差不多，就不表扬我，我就不服气；认为同志的进步和成绩使自己受不到表扬了，憋着一口气非超过她不可。这究竟是为谁打算呢？难道不是为自己打算吗！这究竟是什么心呢？难道不是自私自利之心吗！
    和白求恩一比，把我的非无产阶级思想比出来了。
    读了《纪念白求恩》，我又重读《为人民服务》。毛主席说：
  “我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”这句话，过去我曾经读过，可是现在读起来，感到很解决问题。我想，李桂英师傅，是自己的阶级姐妹，是自己的同志，我把人家看歪了；人家提高接头速度，是为了给革命多纺纱，我却把人家当成争名夺利的对手，只许自己压倒别人，不许别人超过自己。我越想越觉得心又跳，脸又烧，越觉得对不起自己的阶级姐妹。
    为了个人而超先进，这不对。抹掉了超先进的雄心，做一个庸庸碌碌的人，我又不甘心。怎么办？我按照毛主席的教导：放下为个人而超先进的包袱，坚定为革命而超先进的决心。
    思想问题解决了，我又急起直追李桂英师傅。这时候，我所想的，不是要压倒她，而是要赶上和超过她所创的先进水平。这时候，我所采用的办法，不是憋着一口气，蒙住头一个人拼命地练，而是拜她为师，认认真真学习她的经验。
    经过一段学习，我不仅把李师傅的经验拿到了手，而且还在学习中发现了她绕虾米螺丝圈子大，浪费了时间。我把自己发现的这个问题告诉了李师傅，叫她在操作中注意。同时，我又在自己的实践中，寻找克服的办法，并且将自己的体会告诉了她。就这样，我的接头速度很快超过了二十根。
    从这件事情上，使我深深地体会到：有了毛泽东思想无往而不胜，离开了毛泽东思想寸步难行。
    后来，从《矛盾论》里，我进一步懂得任何事物的内部，都存在着对立面的斗争；在一定条件下，对立面经过斗争，一方会战胜另一方，互相转化。我细细一想，毛主席教导我们的这个道理，正好说明了我赶超李桂英师傅的过程。开始想超李师傅，我脑子里就有对立面的斗争，这就是个人英雄主义和革命英雄主义的斗争。斗争当中，我学了毛主席著作，有了毛泽东思想这个最好的武器，促使革命的英雄主义战胜了个人英雄主义，这样，使我放下了为个人而超的包袱，坚定了为革命而超的信心。使个人主义的不服气，开始变成了革命的不服气。
    第三，在毛主席哲学思想的指导下，对摸索纺纱的客观规律有了自觉性。
    开始，我认为是自己对于接头法掌握得不好，便拼命地练接头方法。怎么练也总是不灵，仍然要出现圪瘩。这时候，我一方面想着要顽强地干到胜利，另一方面心上又有个怕失败的阴影。
    为啥老是出现圪瘩呢？带着这个问题，我又学习毛主席著作。
    毛主席说：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”
    毛主席的教导，使我心里亮了。我想，接头也是这样，也有它自己的规律性，不认识接头的规律，不按规律办事，怎么能不出圪瘩！
    为了摸索接头的客观规律，下班以后我就在别人的车旁看，一看就能看上几个小时，忘记了吃饭，忘记了下班以后的疲劳。看到了别人的经验，我又刻苦地练习，纱把指头拉出了一道血口，也不间断练功。
    就这样，我先后吸取了三十多个同志的经验。但是，光学习别人的经验是不行的。按照毛主席的教导，我又通过自己的实践来考证别人的经验，吸取用得着的东西，拒绝用不着的东西，加进自己所特有的东西，反复进行了试验。
      “练兵”当中，我从右送、左送、平送、正送这四个送纱的方向作对比试验。试验的结果，发现“正送”虽然还有弱点，但是，比较顺当。我便从已有的接头法和同志们的操作中，吸取有益的经验，帮助“正送”排除弱点，使它不断完善。就这样，在领导和同志们的大力帮助下，我在吸取别人经验的同时，加上了自己在实践中的体会，总结出了“对准须条向上轻扶”接头法，基本实现了接头无疵点。
    经过三年大跃进，取得了丰富的经验。经过三年调整，把经验总结起来了。这时候，全国出现了生产新高潮，厂党委提出了增产不增人的号召。我兴奋得不得了，我决心要为革命“冒尖”。但是，我思想上有时又怕“冒尖”。
    想“冒尖”与怕“冒尖”，两种思想斗争的结果，使我弄清了一些道理，得到了一些正确的认识：
    “冒尖”必然要暴露缺点，这是客观规律。事情总是这样，停留在原来的水平上，要是干自己熟悉的那一套，不容易看出毛病来，很少出岔子。只要往高的水平一飞跃，不熟悉的东西就多了，容易暴露毛病，免不了要出岔子。但是，克服了缺点，纠正了岔子，就是前进。所以，“冒尖”暴露了缺点，出了点岔子，是正常的事情，是好事情。
    “冒尖”必然要受到群众的注视，这是客观规律。群众注视了，许多双眼睛看着一个“尖子”，看得细致，看得周到，会发现自己所看不到的缺点，会提出自己想不到的意见。这是群众对“尖子”的爱护和监督。所以，“冒尖”以后，有更多的人关怀自己，给自己提意见，这是正常的事情，是好事情。
      “冒尖”必然要打乱旧的秩序、破坏旧的平衡，这也是客观规律。自己革命，别人也要革命，旧的秩序打乱了，可以建立新的秩序，旧的平衡破坏了，可以再组织新的平衡。这样一来，一浪推一浪，我们的革命事业就能不断推向前进。所以，“冒尖”打乱旧秩序、破坏旧平衡，是正常的事情，是好事情。
    弄清了这些道理，得到了这些正确认识之后，我就感到，敢不敢“冒尖”，实质上就是敢不敢革命、敢不敢为革命付出代价、敢不敢斗倒“我”字的大问题。因此，我下定决心，非“冒尖”不可！
    在去年三月份，我看的纱锭由一千二，增加到了一千六。
    这是我在三年调整之后的头一次“冒尖”。
    从这次的“冒尖”过程中，我初步体会到，比起一九五八年到一九六○年那三年大跃进来又有新的不同。最主要的是增加了一个“稳”字，突出了一个“好”字，又注意了劳逸结合。从我三月份扩台扩锭后直到七月初，经过四个多月的试验实践之后，厂里才有组织、有领导地进行扩台扩锭。虽然扩台扩锭中有过一些缺点，但成绩是肯定的。厂里在生产上“冒尖”的不是我一个，而是几十个、几百个，使全厂的生产水平有了新的提高。
    自然，不仅当时有些人怕我“飞”上去又跌下来，就是现在也还有些人怀疑我是不是能看了一千六百锭。他们有的怕我忙不过来，累坏身子，有的是怕我看锭多影响质量。总的说，我知道他们也是一片好心，也是在关怀我，帮助我。事实上我在扩台扩锭后，也确实是暴露了一些扩台扩锭前不可能暴露的缺点。扩锭前，我看一千二百锭，很轻松，工作时间还能捎带看报。扩锭后开头几天，感到很忙，很紧张，巡回路线打乱了，断头增多了，清洁工作的量大了。
    怎么办？我又学习《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》等文章，毛主席的教导，使我心明，眼亮，胆壮，骨气硬。心想，要“冒尖”，就不能害怕暴露前进中的缺点，要革命，就不能怕苦、怕难、怕险。这时候，老师傅也鼓励我说：“一千六百锭，过去谁也没有看过。咱们不是都学过《实践论》吗？你有了实践，就大胆地总结自己实践经验，创造一个新的一千六百锭的巡回法。”听到这种饱含阶级情谊的鼓励，我感到浑身是劲，心想，既然别人没有给我创造下现成的一千六百锭的巡回路线，那么，我就根据毛主席的指示，在实践的过程中把它摸出来！
    经过一段努力，在领导和同志们的帮助下，我总结出了一千六百锭的巡回法，进一步改进了清洁工作，提高了接头的速度和质量，使“冒尖”后暴露的新问题开始得到了解决。这样就又由新的被动转变为新的主动，开始在看管一千六百纱锭的情况下，掌握了新的主动权。去年我一个人全年棉纱产量超过了一千多公斤；白花（皮辊花）消耗减少了三千三百二十八两，清洁分全年达到九十九点九一分，操作分平均为九十八点四四分，出勤率百分之百，做到了安全无事故。
    现在，我的面前又摆着一个新的一分为二：思想上有所进步，但是和同志们比起来，还有很大差距；技术上有所进步，但是和同志们比起来，还有很大的差距。不进步就要落后，进步得慢也要落后。我时时在鞭策自己：要象大庆人那样，活学活用毛主席著作，把自己改造成为一个彻底的革命者。
    我生平最难忘的，就是去年国庆节见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在毛主席的身边我激动地流下了眼泪。当时，我暗暗发誓：要永远忠于毛泽东思想。这是我一辈子的誓言。我要加紧学习，很好掌握毛泽东思想这个最好的武器，向着自己的不足开火，不断向顶峰前进。
