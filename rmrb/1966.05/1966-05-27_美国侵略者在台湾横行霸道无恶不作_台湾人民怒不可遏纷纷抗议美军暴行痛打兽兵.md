    American aggressors in Taiwan run rampant, commit all kinds of evil, and are burdened with blood debts.
    According to Taiwan newspapers, American official in Taiwan, Elam, drove a car on the evening of April 12, speeding from Taipei’s Songshan Airport toward the city center. At the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fuxing North Road, he crashed directly into a noodle stand, immediately inflicting serious injuries on Huang Yuefeng, the girl pushing the cart, who died in less than an hour. Two other young men pushing carts, Huang Yueying and Chen Jinchun, were also knocked down, unconscious in pools of blood.
    On another night, an American soldier in Taiwan drove a car in Taipei and knocked down a Taiwanese woman, Chen Xiangyin, leaving her unconscious on the ground. At the time, angry masses rushed forward to surround the American murderer, demanding that he take the victim to the hospital for treatment. This American soldier, relying on the "extraterritorial privileges" enjoyed by the American military in Taiwan, not only flatly refused but even punched people before speeding away in his car and fleeing to the American military barracks.
    According to statistics from the Jiang gang's "Road Traffic Committee," there were 5,445 traffic accidents in Taiwan last year, with 844 Taiwanese compatriots killed and 6,974 injured with "missing limbs and broken legs." The perpetrators of these accidents were mostly officers and soldiers of the American invading army.
    The crimes of American military officers and soldiers raping and even killing Taiwanese women are too numerous to count. According to reports, in Kaohsiung City, an American soldier named Mou Sili dragged a Taiwanese woman, Xie Xiuqin, into a jeep, raped her, and then threw her from the speeding car, breaking her wrist and waist bones and causing her head to bleed.
    In Taoyuan County, there was also an incident of a female student committing suicide after being defiled. Liu Juanjuan, an 18-year-old female student at Yangmei Middle School in Taoyuan County, was suddenly dragged into a car by three American soldiers on her way home from school one evening and taken to the suburbs, where she was gang-raped. Liu Juanjuan angrily went to the American military command to accuse the American soldiers of their bestial acts, but the American military leaders shielded the criminal soldiers in every possible way and instructed the Jiang gang's military police and police authorities to persecute her in various ways. Soon, Liu Juanjuan finally committed suicide by lying on the railroad tracks in resentment. In her suicide note, she wrote: "American robbers have driven me to my death. Like many Taiwanese sisters, I have nowhere to report my hatred and nowhere to redress my grievances..."
    American military and political personnel and their families often rob people on the streets and engage in drug trafficking and smuggling in various parts of Taiwan. A staff member of the Jiang gang's "Taiwan Provincial Police Department Foreign Affairs Office" revealed in the pseudo-Legislative Yuan that one in two American military and political personnel in Taiwan is a criminal. Late one night, two American soldiers smashed the glass windows of a hotel in Taipei with wooden sticks, jumped inside, tied up the owner with ropes, robbed a large amount of property, and swaggered away.
    The American military in Taiwan also uses "tax exemptions" and "exemption from inspection of imported goods" and other "privileges" to smuggle, importing large quantities of cosmetics, daily necessities, toys, and drugs from the United States, Japan, and other places to dump on the Taiwan market for profit. According to a report in Taipei's *United Daily News* on April 10, the "US Military Supply Command" stationed on Zhongshan North Road in Taipei recently openly opened a "discount store" to sell these smuggled goods.
    The towering crimes of the American aggressors in Taiwan have ignited the anti-American anger of the Taiwanese compatriots. According to Taiwan newspapers, from March 12 to 15, six Taiwanese youths used shotguns to shoot at the windows of the American "Embassy" in Taiwan from a building opposite the American "Embassy" multiple times. Fearing that this would cause an anti-American storm among the Taiwanese people like the one in 1957, the Jiang gang quickly dispatched police to search for and arrest these anti-American youths.
    Last December, when "military doctors" from the "US Naval Second Medical Research Institute" were drawing children's blood at Qieding Elementary School in Kaohsiung City to conduct bacterial experiments, parents gathered in the school upon hearing the news and surrounded the American aggressors, shouting and beating them. Not long ago, nearly 100 family members of Taiwanese sailors who lost their lives on the American "Shipping No. 2" ship, dragging their children, holding the "spirit tablets" of their loved ones, and wearing mourning clothes, went to the Jiang gang's "Control Yuan" to protest the American aggressors' crimes of disregarding human life. On another occasion, when an American soldier named Parker stationed in Tainan beat a Taiwanese tricyclist for no reason, another tricyclist present pulled out the tricycles brake lever and beat him until his head was bleeding, causing him to flee with his head in his hands.
    In recent years, in some towns in Taiwan, some American military officers and soldiers stationed in Taiwan have been found beaten to death and their bodies abandoned in the wilderness, and the villas of some American military and political officials stationed in Taiwan and American military "reception centers" have been set on fire. On the barbed wire surrounding some American invasion army garrisons, Taiwanese people often hang a wooden sign with the words: "This is Chinese territory," "Yankees go home."

### 美国侵略者在台湾横行霸道无恶不作  台湾人民怒不可遏纷纷抗议美军暴行痛打兽兵

    美国侵略者在台湾横行霸道无恶不作
    台湾人民怒不可遏纷纷抗议美军暴行痛打兽兵
    侵台美国军政人员，在台湾横行霸道，无恶不作，血债累累。
    据台湾报纸报道，侵台美国官员艾兰姆，四月十二日晚上驾驶一辆轿车，由台北松山机场向市区内疾驰，在南京路与复兴北路口，直向一个卖面食的小摊贩车子冲去，当即把推摊车的女孩黄月凤撞成重伤，不到一小时便死亡。另外两个推摊车的青年黄月英、陈进春，也被撞倒在血泊中昏迷不醒。
    另一天晚上，一个侵台美国士兵在台北市开车把台湾妇女陈香银撞倒在地，昏迷不醒。当时愤怒的群众冲上前去围住美国凶手，要他把受害者送医院治疗。这个美国兵仗着侵台美军享有“治外特权”，不但断然拒绝，还竟然挥拳打人，然后开足汽车马力冲出人群逃往美军兵营。
    据蒋帮“道路交通委员会”统计，去年台湾各地共发生车祸五千四百四十五次，有八百四十四个台湾同胞死亡，六千九百七十四人被撞得“缺肢断腿”。肇祸的凶手绝大部分都是美国侵略军官兵。
    侵台美军官兵强奸以至杀害台湾妇女的罪行，更是罄竹难书。据报道，在高雄市，一个名叫牟司利的美国兵，把台湾妇女谢秀琴拉上吉普车强奸，随后又把她从正在飞奔的汽车上抛下来，摔得她手腕、腰骨折断，头破血流。
    在桃园县，还发生了一个女学生被污辱后含冤自杀事件。桃园县杨梅中学十八岁的女学生刘娟娟，一天晚上在放学回家的路上，突然被三个美国兽兵拖上汽车，开到郊外轮奸。刘娟娟愤怒地跑到侵台美军指挥机关控告美军兽行，美军头目却百般袒护犯罪士兵，并且指使蒋帮宪兵和警察当局对她进行种种迫害。不久，刘娟娟终于含恨卧轨自杀。她在遗书中写道：“美国强盗把我逼上了死路。我和许许多多台湾姊妹一样，有仇无处报，有冤无处伸……”。
    美国侵台军政人员和他们的家属，经常在台湾各地拦路抢劫，贩毒走私。蒋帮“台湾省警务处外事室”一个工作人员曾在伪立法院透露，在台湾的美国军政人员，每两个人就有一个是刑事犯。一天深夜，两个美国兵用木棍捣碎了台北市一家酒店的玻璃窗，跳进去用绳索把店主捆住，抢劫大批财物扬长而去。
    侵台美军还利用“豁免关税”、“进口货物不受检查”等“特权”进行走私，从美国、日本等地运进大量化妆品、日用品、玩具和毒品，在台湾市场上倾销牟利。据台北市《联合报》四月十日报道，驻台北市中山北路的“美军供应司令部”最近公然开设了一个“廉价商店”，贩卖这些私货。
    美国侵略者在台湾的滔天罪行，燃起了台湾同胞的反美怒火。据台湾报纸透露，三月十二日至十五日，有六名台湾青年，在美国驻台湾“大使馆”对面的建筑物上，用鸟枪对准美国“大使馆”的窗户，多次进行射击。蒋帮惟恐由此引起象一九五七年那样的台湾人民反美风暴，连忙出动警察，搜捕这些反美青年。
    去年十二月，当“美国海军第二医学研究所”的“军医”在高雄市茄萣小学抽取儿童血液进行细菌实验的时候，学生家长闻讯，纷纷齐集校内，把美国侵略者团团围住，齐声喊打。不久以前，在美国“航运二号”轮船上丧失生命的台湾海员家属近一百人，拖儿带女，手捧她们亲人的“灵牌”，披麻戴孝到蒋帮“监察院”，抗议美国侵略者草菅人命的罪行。还有一次，一个驻台南的美国兵派克，无故殴打一个台湾三轮车工人时，被在场的另一个三轮车工人抽出三轮车的刹车棍，打得头破血流，抱头逃窜。
    近年来，在台湾一些城镇，发现有些侵台美军官兵被人打死暴尸荒野，有些侵台美国军政官员的别墅和美军“招待所”，被人点火烧毁。有些美国侵略军驻地周围的铁丝网上，经常发现台湾人民挂上一块木牌，上面写着：“这是中国的领土”，“美国佬滚回去”。
