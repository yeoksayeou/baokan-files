    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 15th - The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on May 15th regarding the incident of U.S. aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace and attacking Chinese aircraft, strongly condemning the blatant provocative action of the United States against China. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    On May 12, 1966, five U.S. fighter planes intruded into the airspace over the Maguan area of Yunnan Province, China, and launched a sudden attack, shooting down a Chinese plane that was undergoing training.
    This is an extremely serious incident perpetrated by the United States against the People's Republic of China and a deliberate act of military provocation.
    On May 13, 1966, the U.S. authorities hastily spread the news that on May 12, 1966, U.S. jet aircraft shot down a plane in the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, 25 to 30 miles south of the Chinese border. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that the aforementioned statement by the U.S. authorities is completely unfounded and its purpose is to cover up the blatant military provocative action of the United States against the People's Republic of China.
    As everyone knows, the U.S. government has consistently adopted a hostile policy towards the People's Republic of China. It is U.S. imperialism that is occupying China’s territory of Taiwan Province, obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and violating China’s territorial waters and airspace more than four hundred times. Obviously, U.S. imperialism has been and is adopting a provocative and bellicose policy towards the People's Republic of China. This action of attacking and shooting down Chinese aircraft occurred after U.S. Secretary of State Rusk put forward the so-called ten-point policy towards China, which further exposed the deceptive rhetoric and aggressive, bellicose nature of the United States.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the stern warning and the correct position put forward by the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense in the statement of May 12, 1966. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the blatant provocative action of the U.S. authorities against China. If U.S. imperialism stubbornly pursues the war of aggression against Vietnam and blatantly violates China’s airspace, the Vietnamese people will stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people, resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism, and will surely give it a fatal blow. May 15, 1966

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th - Shoichi Kasuga, member of the Central Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement regarding the incident of U.S. aircraft shooting down a Chinese plane in the airspace over Yunnan, China, on the 12th, saying that the Japanese Communist Party lodges a firm protest against this unreasonable act of aggression by the U.S. government.
    He said that this incident shows that U.S. imperialism has fallen into difficulties in Vietnam and is trying to seek a way out by gradually expanding the war of aggression.
    Kasuga pointed out that the incident of five U.S. fighter planes intruding into Chinese airspace and shooting down a Chinese plane occurred after the U.S. armed forces intensified their conspiracy to expand the war, bombing areas near Hanoi and Haiphong and shelling Cambodia.
    He said that before the recent incident, U.S. aircraft had also bombed areas near China and intruded into Chinese airspace more frequently than before. He pointed out that the extremely serious significance of this incident lies in: it shows that the purpose of the U.S. imperialist plan to gradually expand the war of aggression against Vietnam is to provoke a large-scale war of aggression against China and other countries; it also shows that U.S. imperialism is actually implementing the plan to gradually expand the war even more rampantly.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 14th - An editorial published in the "Cambodian Telegraph" on the 14th said: "The U.S. aerial robbers actually shot down a Chinese plane in Chinese airspace. This new heinous provocation by U.S. imperialists has aroused the indignation of the whole world." The editorial warned: "Before committing irreparable crimes, Washington's bungling magicians must consider more carefully that a new war can only lead to the death of U.S. imperialism."

    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 14th - The Pakistani newspaper "Construction News" published an editorial on the 14th regarding the provocative act of war in which U.S. imperialist aircraft recently intruded into the airspace of Yunnan Province, China, and shot down a Chinese plane, saying that this incident is the worst example of U.S. imperialist aggression. The editorial pointed out that China is not only a large country but also a country with self-respect. It will not allow the United States to joke with its honor or encroach on its territory.

    越外交部发言人声明越中人民将并肩打击美帝挑衅

    柬埔寨巴基斯坦报纸警告美帝发动新战争必自取灭亡
    新华社河内十五日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人十五日就美国飞机侵入中国领空袭击中国飞机的事件发表声明，强烈谴责美国对中国的明目张胆的挑衅行动。声明全文如下：
    一九六六年五月十二日，美国战斗机五架，侵入中国云南省马关地区上空进行突然袭击，击落正在训练飞行的中国飞机一架。
    这是美国对中华人民共和国进行的一次极为严重的事件，是一次蓄意的军事挑衅行动。
    一九六六年五月十三日美国当局匆忙散布消息说，一九六六年五月十二日美国喷气式飞机在距中国边界以南二十五到三十英里的越南民主共和国领土上击落飞机一架。越南民主共和国政府声明：美国当局的上述说法完全没有根据，其目的是为了掩盖美国对中华人民共和国的明目张胆的军事挑衅行动。
    众所周知，美国政府一贯对中华人民共和国采取敌视政策。正是美帝国主义侵略中国的领土台湾省，阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位，侵犯中国的领海、领空达四百多次。很明显，美帝国主义已经和正在对中华人民共和国采取挑衅和好战的政策。这次袭击和击落中国飞机的行动是在美国国务卿腊斯克提出的所谓对中国的十点政策之后发生的，这就更加揭穿了美国的欺骗论调和侵略、好战的面目。
    越南民主共和国政府完全支持中华人民共和国政府在一九六六年五月十二日中国国防部发言人的声明中所提出的严厉警告和所持的正确立场。越南民主共和国政府强烈谴责美国当局对中国的明目张胆的挑衅行动。如果美帝国主义仍然顽固地推行侵略越南的战争，悍然侵犯中国的领空，越南人民将同兄弟的中国人民并肩一起，坚决战斗、反对美帝国主义，并且必将给它以致命的打击。一九六六年五月十五日
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央政治局委员春日正一就美国飞机十二日在中国云南上空击落中国飞机一事发表谈话说，日本共产党向美国政府的这种无理的侵略行动提出坚决抗议。
    他说，这一事件表明，美帝国主义在越南已经陷入困境，它正在企图通过逐步扩大侵略战争来寻求出路。
    春日指出，五架美国战斗机侵入中国领空，击落中国飞机一事发生在美国武装部队加紧推行扩大战争的阴谋，轰炸河内和海防附近地区以及炮击柬埔寨以后。
    他说，在最近的事件发生之前，美国飞机轰炸中国附近地区以及入侵中国领空的事情也比以往更加频繁。他指出，这一事件的极为严重的意义在于：它表明美帝国主义逐步扩大侵越战争的计划的目的，是在对中国和其它国家挑起大规模的侵略战争；它也表明，美帝国主义实际上是在更加猖狂地实施逐步扩大战争的计划。
    据新华社金边十四日电　《柬埔寨电讯报》十四日发表的社论说：“美国空中强盗竟然在中国领土上空击落了一架中国飞机。美帝国主义者的这一新的罪恶的挑衅，激起了全世界的愤慨。”社论提出警告说：“华盛顿的蹩脚魔术师们在犯下不可弥补的罪行以前，必须更认真地考虑一番，新的战争只能使美帝国主义死亡。”
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十四日电　巴基斯坦《建设报》十四日就美帝国主义者的飞机最近侵入中国云南省上空，击落一架中国飞机的挑衅性战争行为发表社论说，这一事件是美帝国主义侵略行为的最恶劣的事例。社论指出，中国不仅是一个大国，而且是一个有自尊心的国家。它不允许美国拿它的荣誉来开玩笑，或者侵占它的领土。
