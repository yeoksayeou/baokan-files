    Serving the Class Brothers of the World
    Entrusted by the 650 million people of the motherland and cherishing deep class feelings for the health of the foreign people, the Chinese medical teams have traveled across mountains and rivers to various friendly countries. Chinese doctors firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and are determined to be Bethune-style doctors. They are busy day and night for the working people of all countries. They are not only doctors, but also nurses. Their meticulous care for patients has been warmly praised by the vast number of foreign people. (Attached picture)
