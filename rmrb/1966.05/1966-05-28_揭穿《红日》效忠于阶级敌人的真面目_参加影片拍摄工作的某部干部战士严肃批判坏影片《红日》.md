    Exposing the True Face of "Red Sun" as Serving the Class Enemy
    —Cadres and Soldiers of a Certain Unit Participating in the Film's Production Seriously Criticize the Bad Film "Red Sun"
    Editor's Note: The film "Red Sun" (written by Qu Baiyin, directed by Tang Xiaodan, produced by Shanghai Tianma Film Studio) is a major poisonous weed. It sings the praises of the Kuomintang reactionary army and erects monuments and biographies for the executioners who slaughtered the people. It viciously attacks people's war and comprehensively uglifies and severely distorts our army. The talks by cadres and soldiers and the editor's note in the "Liberation Army Daily" make a powerful criticism of this bad film.
    "Liberation Army Daily" Editor's Note: Today, this newspaper publishes "Exposing the True Face of 'Red Sun' as Serving the Class Enemy," which is a serious criticism of this bad film by some cadres and soldiers of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region who participated in the filming of "Red Sun" at the time.
    These cadres and soldiers, out of enthusiasm for supporting the socialist revolutionary literary and artistic cause, once participated in the filming of some scenes in this film. Even in such a partial filming process, our cadres and soldiers had already discovered many serious errors in the script and the director's work. They had repeatedly criticized and struggled against the writers and directors at that time. However, because the writers and directors consistently adhered to the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, they either tried to cover up or simply ignored these correct criticisms.
    Recently, the cadres and soldiers who participated in the filming of this film re-watched it. Everyone unanimously stated: We must thoroughly expose the true face of the film "Red Sun" as serving the class enemy. Through their personal experiences at the time and a wealth of facts, they revealed the various despicable methods used by the writers and directors to launch vicious attacks on our great Party, our great people, and our great army.
    History is a witness here; see how you can deny it!
    Viciously attacks the leadership of the Communist Party and the political work of our army, highlighting the politics of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    1961 was the first year that the resolutions of the Military Commission Enlarged Meeting "Concerning Strengthening the Political and Ideological Work of the Army" were thoroughly implemented in the troops. A certain unit accepted the task of participating in the filming of "Red Sun." Our cadres and soldiers hoped that the writers and directors could, with great political enthusiasm, follow the spirit of the Military Commission Enlarged Meeting's resolutions and, through this film, praise the great victory of Chairman Mao's military thinking and publicize the enormous power of our army's political work. However, on the contrary, the writers and directors openly attacked Chairman Mao's army-building thought, abolished the Party's leadership over the army, and obliterated our army's political work, deliberately setting themselves against the resolutions of the Military Commission Enlarged Meeting. In the process of participating in the filming, our cadres and soldiers waged a firm struggle against this sinister and malicious intention of the writers and directors.
    Organization Officer Jin Fenqi said: During the filming, what we reflected most strongly was that the film abolished the Party's leadership over the army and promoted the idea of "gun barrel first," "military affairs first," and "individual authority first." Chairman Mao wanted us to always remember: "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and we will never allow the gun to command the Party." This is very clear in the minds of every cadre and soldier. But in the film's more than seven hundred shots from beginning to end, we did not see a single photograph of Chairman Mao, did not hear a single word from Chairman Mao, did not see a single Party committee or branch meeting being held, and did not encounter a single political instructor or director. In the filming process, we felt very strange and often discussed it. Once, when filming our army's outdoor action scenes, some soldiers asked the writers and directors: "Why is it always that bearded company commander, and where is the political instructor?" The writers and directors replied vaguely: "The political instructor's activities are in the interior scenes!" Later, when filming the battle scenes of attacking the enemy, some soldiers again raised the question: "How can we fight a war without a political instructor?" The writers and directors simply replied: "It's a movie; not everyone can go up. Isn't there a political commissar?"
    Platoon Leader Wang Yongming said angrily: It's bad enough not to mention the political commissar, but mentioning the political commissar makes you angry. At that time, I was asked to play the guard of our army's command post. I saw that in the critical moments of the war, when it was necessary to make decisions and formulate strategies, the military political commissar either frowned or walked in circles, or at most fanned himself anxiously, like a simpleton, inserting a few nonsensical words. He was simply a person without any political mind. The political commissars and regimental political commissars depicted in the film were purely caricatures and distortions. They were carrying out the reality of abolishing the Party's leadership and obliterating political work in the name of our army's political workers, advocating "gun barrel first" and that individual authority has the final say.
    Deputy Section Chief Xue Yunde revealed: This anti-Party leadership and individual authority-first ideology of the writers and directors was not only reflected in their shots but also in their daily work and life. At that time, Comrade Li Weizheng, the chief of staff, and I were responsible for mobilizing troops for them and had more contact with them. They did not take the troop's Party committee seriously and regarded the entire troop as their servants. In the filming process, they pursued what "international export value how much money's shots," simply emphasizing "art first," "director first," and "authority first," and simply did not take the filming crew's Party branch seriously; they always had the final say. If they regard the Party's leadership as a thorn in their side, how could they praise the Party's leadership?
    Battalion Commander Yang Yancai said: We can see from participating in the filming that the writers and directors not only intentionally abolished the Party's leadership but also tried every means to obliterate our army's powerful political and ideological work. At that time, our battalion played our army's main attack force, and we felt that the political and ideological work before and after the battle, such as pre-war mobilization, complaining of suffering, promoting military democracy, propaganda and mobilization during the battle, and post-war commendation and celebration, were all cancelled. At that time, I raised questions and suggestions to the writers and directors. But they said impatiently: "That is formality; it is verbose." Is this formality? I participated in the Menglianggu Campaign. At that time, I was a communicator in the battalion headquarters of the main attack force. As soon as the combat mission came down, a "complain of suffering" meeting was held, and everyone raised their class consciousness. The petition letters, guarantee letters, and challenge letters of the entire battalion piled up, and the comrades' combat emotions were very high, which effectively guaranteed the victory of the battle…. But the writers and directors who were hostile to our army's political work completely removed our army's lively political and ideological work, portraying our army as an unorganized rabble without political direction or political minds. I ask, can such troops win battles and have combat effectiveness? It is unbelievable that such an army could annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's "ace" 74th Reorganized Division.
    Platoon Leader Wang Yongming said: The writers and directors also made great distortions to our army's work of disintegrating the enemy army. Our army carried out calls to the enemy, which was originally a powerful political offensive, which played a great role in disintegrating the enemy army. Many soldiers who were unwilling to sell their lives for the Kuomintang reactionaries automatically laid down their weapons and surrendered to our army after hearing the calls. But the writers and directors ignored these iron facts and used the enemy's cunning and stubborn resistance to show the failure of our army's calls. The soldiers who played our army were immediately angrily said: What kind of political offensive is this! The calls brought enemy bullets and our army's casualties, and the enemy behaved so stubbornly and wisely, although they were finally wiped out by our army, but the bloody facts showed that our army's political work to disintegrate the enemy army had failed. We also saw that in the process of filming the film, the writers and directors also maliciously slandered our army's policy of treating prisoners. Zhang Lingfu's battalion commander, Zhang Xiaofu, was captured. In front of our army's senior commanders, he behaved very arrogantly. Even our army's military commander and chief of staff could do nothing about him. Later, he was released on the pretext of persuading him to surrender on the mountain, allowing him to express his loyalty to his master to Zhang Lingfu, and Zhang Lingfu shot him on the spot. The film further illustrated the complete failure of our army's policy of treating prisoners through such a capture and release, a persuasion and a killing, while showing the enemy's heroic integrity. This is really the most vicious means of belittling our army's political work.
    The cadres and soldiers who participated in the filming unanimously reflected: The writers and directors are so hostile to and slanderous of the Party's and Chairman Mao's leadership and our army's political work. What about the enemy army? Standing on the bourgeoisie's stand, the writers and directors are against the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and they are bound to support the leadership of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek; they do not highlight the politics of the people's army, and they are bound to highlight the politics of the Kuomintang reactionary army. Everyone saw clearly and heard clearly in the filming process. The film mentioned "Chairman Chiang," "American Advisory Group," and "Ministry of National Defense" several times, constantly encouraging Zhang Lingfu to lead 30,000 brothers, unite as one, and "serve the Party and the country." When they win, they take photos in the pagoda, celebrate with wine, and boost morale; when the battle is critical, they ask for credit from top to bottom, encourage each other, and boost their fighting spirit. Even in the hour before Zhang Lingfu "killed himself to become a martyr," the enemy commander-in-chief flew in an airplane over Menglianggu to contact Zhang Lingfu. Zhang Lingfu also stood at attention and shouted into the microphone: "Commander-in-chief, commander-in-chief! I am Lingfu, Zhang Lingfu! Please instruct me, please instruct me." The voice of the enemy commander-in-chief immediately came from the radio: "I am in your airspace, I am in your airspace. Chairman has asked me to extend his condolences to you. This battle is of great importance; it is hoped that you will inspire the whole army and continue to work hard! As long as you persist for another two hours, the situation will change." Look, how timely and powerful the enemy's political work is, and how encouraging it is. It was this counter-revolutionary political work that made the enemy's 74th Division fight to the last soldier, until Zhang Lingfu "killed himself to become a martyr." Although the enemy was wiped out by us as a result of the battle, it was only a guise. The enemy won in spirit, and the politics of the Kuomintang reactionaries representing the big landlords and big bourgeoisie won. The writers and directors exhausted their efforts to beautify the enemy. They themselves, like Zhang Lingfu, were indeed loyal to the Kuomintang reactionaries to the end through every shot of the film.
    Attempting to obliterate the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the strategy and tactics of the reactionary army
    The victory of the people's war is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary soldiers who fought north and south under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought during the War of Liberation are very clear about this. However, the writers and directors of the film portrayed our army as a group of unorganized rabble without the command of Mao Zedong Thought, and an armed group that simply wanted to avenge the 74th Division. During the filming process, many of our cadres and soldiers had strong reactions to the content of the film. They pointed out that the enemy's eight million troops have been wiped out. If the film only tells people that a small 74th Division was wiped out, it would not have much significance. It is necessary to reflect the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in the entire War of Liberation through this drop of "water" of the Menglianggu Campaign. However, the writers and directors, determined to obliterate Mao Zedong Thought in the film, stubbornly adhered to their own set of ideas and arbitrarily distorted the history of the people's war.
    Political Department Deputy Director Tang Jianyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Yancai said: Our third battalion was assigned to play our army. The film's writers and directors arranged a scene for us in which our army was in a major rout. At that time, they made the atmosphere smoky, the environment bleak, and they wanted our army to act dejected and the masses to pretend to be sad and disappointed. They made our army's retreat formation a mess. In particular, they also wanted many of our soldiers to carry their guns on their backs, fully demonstrating the embarrassing appearance of being defeated, which caused great aversion to us and the soldiers. We once suggested: "We are carrying out Chairman Mao's great strategic thought to make a proactive transfer, not a rout!" And their answer was: "Here, we are showing a retreat after being defeated; what we want is authenticity!" What is the authenticity of history? That is that Chairman Mao's strategic thought commands our thousands of troops and advances from victory to victory. Chairman Mao's thought of concentrating superior forces and annihilating the enemy one by one, which was put forward in 1946, has not only deeply rooted in the minds of cadres but also in the minds of soldiers and has become the code of action for the majority of commanders and fighters. At that time, the troop's propaganda team wrote the slogan "Not in the gains and losses of a city or a place, but in the annihilation of the Chiang bandit army" in many villages and towns in northern Jiangsu and Shandong. A song was also circulating in the troops: "Mobile warfare, mobile warfare, attack east and west, north and south, and specialize in attacking the enemy's weaknesses..." This fully shows that Chairman Mao's great strategic thought has been familiar and mastered by the majority of commanders and fighters. At that time, the Battle of Lianshui was also a planned strategic transfer in accordance with Chairman Mao's thought of "taking the annihilation of the enemy's living forces as the main goal and not taking the conservation or capture of territory as the main goal." Is it like the film describes, from the people to the officers and soldiers of the troops, from the basic cadres to the mid-level cadres, and even to the political commissar and commander of the senior cadres, all of them are a group of confused idiots without minds? The soldiers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and have a high degree of revolutionary heroism have always been indomitable and invincible in the face of any powerful enemy. Can they run away in a disheveled way and be defeated like the film describes? What a great insult and uglification to Mao Zedong Thought and the people's army!
    Organization Officer Jin Fenqi said: The writers and directors' position is very clear. They obliterate and distort Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, but they try their best to highlight and describe the enemy's strategy and tactics. It is clear that the enemy was controlled by Chairman Mao's strategic thinking and was always led by the nose by our army and passively drilled into our "pocket"; but the writers and directors insist on highlighting Zhang Lingfu's "wise decision" and showing them advancing steadily and taking the initiative step by step. Every time we filmed a shot, we found the writers and directors' tendencies. For example, when filming our army's military appearance and discipline, the writers and directors deliberately uglified our army's queues. Hats can be worn crookedly, clothes buttons can be unbuttoned, and leggings can be tied haphazardly. At the beginning of the filming, the small flag was waved, and you were asked to run on the road like a herd of sheep, completely like a defeated army. When filming the enemy's marching, they painstakingly carved and polished, for fear of not showing their neatness and majesty, and not highlighting their offensive posture. When filming the enemy's artillery marching, the writers and directors fiddled with our artillery troops to practice back and forth on the highway again and again. The five-meter distance between the artillery vehicles was required to be absolutely accurate, which was even stricter than a military parade! When filming the enemy's infantry marching, they also observed carefully and meticulously described every detail, from clothing and expressions to postures. On a road where the enemy's infantry was marching, the writers and directors carefully checked one by one. One "enemy" forgot to tie his belt and was checked out by the writers and directors. They immediately found a wide belt and asked him to tie it tightly and advance majestically. Is this the truth of history? The enemy entered the liberated area under the "command" of our army, just like drilling into a noose. They were always on edge, fearing landmines and ambushes. How could they have that neat and majestic appearance? There is obliteration, there is highlighting. The writers and directors' purpose of obliterating Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking is to greatly highlight the reactionary's "wise decision-making." All of these arrangements are a complete and true manifestation of the writers and directors' class stand and class feelings.
    Platoon Leader Wang Yongming said: The truth of history is that Chairman Mao's strategic thinking mobilized the enemy and led them by the nose, but the film's writers and directors deliberately obliterated everything and did not mention it at all. Instead, they praised Zhang Lingfu as a military strategist who was "good at feigning attacks on the front," "flanking maneuvers," and "accustomed to making a feint to the east and attacking in the west," and made us follow his ass. Our army's luring the enemy deep was written as the enemy "not entering the tiger's den, how to get the tiger's cubs." The fact that our army dug graves for the enemy in the Yimeng Mountains was described as the enemy's attempt to "bloom in the center" and annihilate our army's "feats." In short, the writers and directors exhausted their efforts to erase the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in the minds of our army's commanders and fighters and the broad masses of the people.
    Slandering the flesh-and-blood relationship between our army and the people, covering up the heinous crimes committed by the Kuomintang reactionary army against the people
    In June 1961, the troops participating in the filming came to the filming site in Taocun, Shandong, with the writers and directors. This is an old revolutionary base area with a glorious tradition of struggle. When the local masses heard that they were going to film the movie of attacking Menglianggu and annihilating the Chiang bandit army, they were all very excited. Although it was the busy season for wheat harvest, they, like they did in the War of Liberation, laid down their sickles, carried stretchers, and led donkeys. They got up at five o'clock, climbed over the mountains, and came from dozens of miles away to participate in the filming. They were very much looking forward to filming the great victory of the close cooperation between the military and the people in defeating the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and the brilliant thinking of Chairman Mao's people's war into the film! However, the writers and directors made great slanders to our army's glorious tradition of unity between the military and the people, made malicious distortions to the role of the people in the revolutionary war, and on the contrary, made every effort to cover up the heinous crimes committed by the enemy.
    Battalion Commander Yang Yancai said: In the eyes of the writers and directors, the people are insignificant supporting roles. When filming a shot of the people pushing carts to send grain to support the front, everyone enthusiastically filled the sacks with straw, wanting to fill the sacks bulging and the carts full, so as to fully express the people's desire to actively support the front. But, some just filled a few handfuls, the writers and directors said impatiently: "Forget it, just fill two handfuls, the shot will flash past, who will look at this!" The film is exactly according to the intentions of the writers and directors, in addition to arranging the bleak crowd, carrying stretchers and flashing past in a hurry, no other performance. Chairman Mao said: "Soldiers and civilians are the foundation of victory." Without the support of the people, the victory of the revolutionary war is impossible. During the War of Liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people in various places, in addition to organizing laborers to actively support the front, also organized militias and local corps to cooperate with our army to eliminate the enemy, playing a great role. Thinking back to when we besieged Menglianggu, the masses sent their food, which they were reluctant to eat, to the troops first, and the masses put down their own farm work and supported the front first. The people fully supported the revolutionary war from all aspects of manpower and material resources, becoming a huge guarantee for our army to wipe out the enemy's 74th Division. The writers and directors did not show these iron facts in the shots, but uglified the masses as people who only want the troops to help finish the autumn harvest, short-sighted people who only care about their immediate interests and do not care about the revolutionary war. Their intentions are really sinister!
    Soldier Xie Yongjian said: When we went to participate in the filming of the film, we sang the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" song every day, and we paid attention to carry forward our army's glorious tradition of unity between the military and the people and always paid attention to abiding by and safeguarding mass discipline. But the writers and directors deliberately distorted our army's glorious tradition of consciously abiding by mass discipline and caring for the interests of the people. Once, when filming our army's march, it was clear that the road was passable, but the writers and directors insisted on directing us to expand into the farmland on both sides of the road and step on the people's crops. When we suggested that our army's marching and fighting should also care for the interests of the people, the writers and directors used the needs of filming as an excuse to say: "Step on it, compensate for the damage with money!" Is it just a few crops that are being damaged and trampled here? No! The writers and directors' intention is for our army to trample on its glorious tradition and damage the close relationship between the people's army and the masses. It is precisely under this vicious intention that the officers and fighters of our army who appear in the film are all "old generals" who are detached from the people and do not respect the people. Company Commander Shi Donggen is a representative carefully depicted by the writers and directors. He is full of complaints, cold and indifferent to the people. He does not understand that he is a soldier of the people, and he does not understand that doing a good job of mass work is one of the three major tasks of our army.
    Deputy Section Chief Xue Yunde said: The writers and directors, while distorting and slandering the relationship between our army and the people, tried their best to cover up the enemy's heinous crimes of harming the people and plundering the people, and covering up the sharp class contradictions between the Kuomintang reactionaries and the people. In the film, those counter-revolutionary executioners are kind and well-behaved. They do not kill a person, do not catch a chicken, do not lead a cow, and do not rob a needle and thread. This kind of strict military discipline, without committing any crimes, where is it like a reactionary army! We know that the enemy's 74th Division was Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of troops, which were extremely reactionary. Wherever they went, they robbed, burned, and killed. One of my relatives lived near Menglianggu, and three members of his family were killed by the enemy's 74th Division at one time. When the enemy's 74th Division was driven to Menglianggu by our army, they robbed with red eyes, grabbing chickens when they saw chickens, and grabbing dogs when they saw dogs. They robbed and killed many villages. Why do the writers and directors not expose the enemy's accumulated blood debts, the crimes committed one by one, and the sharp class contradictions between the enemy and the people, where the enemy and the people are irreconcilable? Why do they cover them up instead? Where does the writers and directors' stand stand?
    Distorting our army's principle of unity between officers and soldiers, praising the enemy's "sincere unity"
    In order to comprehensively discredit Chairman Mao's army-building thought, the writers and directors greatly uglified and distorted our army's principle of unity between officers and soldiers in the process of filming the film, depicting the relationship between our army's officers and soldiers as estranged, with prominent contradictions, and not united with each other. They beautified the enemy as being of one mind, like an iron plate. The cadres and soldiers who assisted and participated in the filming were very dissatisfied with this.
    Company Commander Li Mingzhang said: Not long after participating in the filming of the film, the company carried out more than ten days of study of the management and education regulations, further improving class consciousness, improving management methods, and uniting closely from top to bottom. However, the relationship between officers and soldiers of our army that everyone saw at the filming site was very difficult to tolerate. Our army's company commander defied his superiors, was impolite, and was rude and unreasonable to his subordinates. He was reckless and arbitrary in his work. The soldiers were dissatisfied with this image and said: "Our company commander does not have so many quirks!" The writers and directors explained: "This is a typical character of being rough and simple." Everyone was unconvinced and discussed behind their backs: What typical character is this? This is a bandit and a madman. We don't have such a company commander at all! The writers and directors not only uglified Shi Donggen into this hateful appearance, but also used various methods to portray the cadres at all levels of our army as people without political minds and class feelings, who were more rude than the other. The military commander was a worried defeated general, the regimental commander was a reckless and ignorant young man, the company commander was a drunkard and a madman, and the platoon leader and his wife became Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan who "joined the army and left the kiln." In a word, our army did not have a decent soldier, did not have a decent commander, and even the revolutionary base area did not have a decent mass. Where can it be said that we are a new type of people's army and outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people? Our army, nurtured by the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, under the wise leadership of the Party, has trained and cultivated countless revolutionary heroes who stand tall in the long revolutionary war. The writers and directors did not show them at all, but instead uglified them to the point where people could not stand it. Does this not show that the writers and directors have a deep hatred for our army?
    Soldier Lü Guanmin and Battalion Commander Yang Yancai said: The writers and directors uglified our army's relationship between officers and soldiers in every possible way, while praising the enemy army's relationship between officers and soldiers with full enthusiasm. The two formed a clear contrast. Once, when filming the scene of the enemy army's Zhou Brigade Commander leading the supervision team to organize the breakout, at the beginning of the filming, the enemy failed to break out and retreated. The supervision team immediately opened fire to stop the retreat. The submachine gun fired a fan, and a group of enemies fell down in response. This was a true reflection of the intensification of the enemy army's internal contradictions, and the comrades who watched the scene were very convinced. However, the writers and directors saw it in their eyes and felt it in their hearts, and hurriedly ordered the filming to stop. Why? After he explained it repeatedly, everyone understood that the writers and directors thought that the "brothers" killed by the supervision team were too many, which would damage the spirit of "sincere unity" and "loyalty to the country" of the enemy's 74th Division. He personally directed several re-shoots before it became the scene on the screen today: only one officer and one soldier fell down. In order to praise the internal relations of the enemy army, the writers and directors took so much pains not to let go of any opportunity to put powder on the enemy. Please see, from the pagoda photo of Zhang Lingfu and his gang to the toast and celebration at the banquet, from leading the division north to fighting to the last soldier, what we heard was the enemy laughing together for victory, and what we saw was the enemy living in harmony, working together, and "serving the Party and the country." Even Zhang Xiaofu, who was slapped twice by Zhang Lingfu after being captured and released, was willing to do his best for the safety of Zhang Lingfu's life and the future of the "30,000 brothers" at the last moment when the enemy was about to be completely annihilated. What is the purpose of the writers and directors to uglify our army's relationship between officers and soldiers and beautify the enemy army's relationship between officers and soldiers so much? Is it not clear!
    Desperately uglifying the people's army, carefully writing biographies and erecting monuments for counter-revolutionary elements
    Chairman Mao taught us that revolutionary literature and art should praise the people and expose the enemy. However, the writers and directors of the film "Red Sun" used all means of film art, such as scenes, atmosphere, sound, and effects, to uglify and distort our army and beautify and praise the enemy.
    The cadres and soldiers who participated in the filming and lived near the residence of the writers and directors said: At that time, we often heard a creepy burst of mad laughter from the woods, which made people get goosebumps all over. This is the laughter of Shi Donggen, the company commander of our army in the film. In order to uglify him like a madman, the writers and directors made the actors constantly learn and practice this kind of howling and mad laughter. In order to insult our people's army, the writers and directors really exhausted their efforts from all aspects of the characters' words and actions. In the film, the soldiers of our army are described as: stutterers, confused, fools, and Mao Sanqiang, in short, a bunch of idiots who only know how to eat and sleep. Our army commander became a frowning defeated general, the military commissar became a puppet who only knew how to shake a fan, the regimental commander became a reckless young man without any political mind, the company commander became a drunkard and a madman, and the platoon leader and his wife became Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan who "joined the army and left the kiln." In a word, our army did not have a decent soldier, did not have a decent commander, and even the revolutionary base area did not have a decent mass. Where can it be said that we are a new type of people's army and outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people? Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought and the wise leadership of the Party, our army has trained and cultivated countless revolutionary heroes who stand tall in the long revolutionary war. The writers and directors did not show them at all, but instead uglified them to the point where people could not stand it. Does this not show that the writers and directors have a deep hatred for our army?
    Trumpeter Ma Xuehe said: The writers and directors, while uglifying our army, also did their best to beautify the enemy. At that time, the writers and directors asked me to play a trumpeter in our army, and asked me to stand near the regimental command post after the battle with the enemy's 74th Division broke out, and also to pretend to be worried, afraid, and uneasy. During the War of Liberation, I personally participated in the Menglianggu Campaign. At that time, I was also a trumpeter. Although I was very young, in order to avenge the oppressed poor people across the country, as soon as I heard about the battle, I rushed forward, and I didn't know what fear was. This time, the film asked me to pretend to be a coward, I didn't do it! I firmly refused to play this role. However, in filming many shots of the enemy, the writers and directors described the enemy as each and every one of them standing tall, with their chests out, majestic and powerful. When the enemy's 74th Division entered Lianshui City, it was like holding an entrance ceremony. Zhang Lingfu fled to Menglianggu, and he was as calm and self-possessed as if he was taking a walk. What is even more infuriating is that when the writers and directors wanted us to send a platoon to play Zhang Lingfu's guard team, they carefully selected them, and even eliminated those who were a little shorter. Obviously, they believed that those who were not tall and burly were not worthy of being the enemy's guards. The writers and directors' love for the Kuomintang's "military might" would even make the living Zhang Lingfu ashamed. I can't help but ask, what kind of people are these writers and directors?
    Instructor Gao Mingli said: When filming the enemy army breaking through our army's 385 Highlands and our army was in a tight spot, the writers and directors asked me to play a staff officer in our army's regimental headquarters. When my regimental commander shouted anxiously: "Request artillery support," they asked me to hold the microphone and stand aside, standing like this for a while, and like that for a while, acting as panicked as an ant on a hot pot. This is obviously malicious uglification of our army. At that time, I said: "I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, and I can't learn this expression!" And I refused to play it. The writers and directors uglified our army like this, what about the enemy? That was all kinds of beautification! Our comrade Zhang Hongkun was called to play the enemy's staff officer, and he performed the scene when our army was about to attack the main peak of Menglianggu, and they were eating canned food in a big way. The "enemy staff officer" performed by Comrade Zhang Hongkun was even afraid and thirsty, and swallowed it greedily, depicting a scene of panic. This was originally a true portrayal of the enemy, but at that time, the writers and directors immediately stopped him and asked him to be more elegant and calm. The writers and directors' love and hatred are so clear, and their methods are so insidious!
    Deputy Section Chief Zhang Xianyao and Platoon Leader Wang Yongming said: The writers and directors also tried to use the enemy's mouths, our army's mouths, the prisoners' mouths, and the people's mouths to praise the enemy together, praising, blowing, praising, and singing together, cooperating with each other, increasing the enemy's morale, and destroying our army's prestige. You see, one shot: A liberated soldier, Ma Busheng, said: "Fighting the 74th Division is not a joke! ...They are all American equipment!" One shot: Our army soldier Zhang Delai said: "Hey! So many shells, like...like dumplings." One shot: Zhang Lingfu said: "What pocket formation, Bagua formation, don't make the Communist Party too magical!" One shot: Our army commander Shen Zhenxin said: "Zhang Lingfu is used to making a feint to the east and attacking in the west!" In short, everything in the film is to highlight the enemy's might, tenacity, and loyalty. Everything in the film is to serve the shaping of the enemy's 74th Division, this "heroic" unit, and Zhang Lingfu, this "heroic" figure. Until Zhang Lingfu was killed, the photos under the pagoda were still intact, only the glass was a little broken. We can see the intention of the writers and directors at a glance. What they want to say is nothing more than this: Although Zhang Lingfu is dead, his spirit will last forever like a pagoda.
    Serving the overthrown Kuomintang reactionaries
    The cadres and soldiers who participated in the filming said: After Zhang Lingfu died, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to deceive his lackeys to serve his counter-revolutionary rule, erected a memorial for Zhang Lingfu by Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing. After liberation, it was quickly destroyed by the masses. However, the writers and directors conspired to re-erect a "monument" for the executioner who slaughtered the people through the film "Red Sun" and write a hymn for the Kuomintang reactionary army. The writers and directors completely stood on the position of the Kuomintang reactionaries and were loyal to the overthrown big landlords and big bourgeoisie. The film "Red Sun" is a thorough anti-Party and anti-socialist big poisonous weed and a sinister and vicious anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous arrow! We must thoroughly expose it, liquidate it, and never give up until we reach our goal!

    揭穿《红日》效忠于阶级敌人的真面目
    ——参加影片拍摄工作的某部干部战士严肃批判坏影片《红日》
    编者按：影片《红日》（瞿白音编剧，汤晓丹导演，上海天马电影制片厂摄制）是一株大毒草。它为国民党反动军队歌功颂德，为屠杀人民的刽子手立传树碑。它恶毒地攻击人民战争，对我军进行了全面的丑化和严重的歪曲。《解放军报》这组干部、战士谈话和编者按语，对这部坏影片进行了有力的批判。
    《解放军报》编者按：本报今天发表的《揭穿〈红日〉效忠于阶级敌人的真面目》，是当时参加拍摄《红日》的济南部队某部一些干部、战士对这部坏影片的严肃批判。
    这些干部战士，当年出于支持社会主义革命文艺事业的热忱，曾经参加了这部影片的部分场景的拍摄工作。就是在这样一个局部的拍摄过程中，我们的干部战士已经发现剧本和导演的许多严重错误，当时曾经向编导者多次提出批评意见，并且进行了斗争。但是，由于编导者始终坚持资产阶级的反动立场，对待这些正确的批评，不是百般掩饰，就是置之不理。
    最近，参加拍摄这部影片的干部战士，重新看了这部影片。大家一致表示：一定要彻底揭穿影片《红日》效忠于阶级敌人的真面目。他们通过当时的亲身感受和大量事实，揭露了编导者运用种种卑劣手法，对我们伟大的党、伟大的人民、伟大的军队所进行的恶毒攻击。
    历史见证在此，看你们怎样抵赖得了！
    恶毒地攻击共产党的领导和我军的政治工作，突出国民党反动派的政治
    一九六一年，正是军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》在部队深入贯彻落实的头一年。某部接受了参加拍摄影片《红日》的任务，我们的干部战士希望编导者能以极大的政治热情，遵照军委扩大会议决议精神，通过这部影片歌颂毛主席建军思想的伟大胜利，宣扬我军政治工作的巨大威力。然而，恰恰相反，编导者却明目张胆地攻击毛主席的建军思想，取消党对军队的领导，抹煞我军政治工作，存心与军委扩大会议决议唱对台戏。在参加拍摄影片的过程中，我们的干部战士，对编导者这种阴险恶毒的意图进行了坚决的斗争。
    组织干事金奋起说：拍摄当中，我们反映最强烈的首先是影片中取消了党对军队的领导，宣传枪杆子第一，军事第一，个人权威第一。毛主席要我们时刻牢记：“我们的原则是党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党。”这在我们每个干部战士的头脑中是很明确的。可是在影片从头到尾的七百多个镜头里，我们没有看到一张毛主席的相片，没有听到毛主席的一句话，没有看到开过一次党委会和支部会，没有遇到一个教导员和指导员。在拍摄过程中我们感到很奇怪，常常议论。有一次，拍我军外景动作时，有的战士问编导者：“为什么翻来复去的就是那么个胡子连长，不见指导员呢？”编导者却含含糊糊地说：“指导员的活动在内景！”后来，拍向敌人进攻的战斗场面时，有的战士又提出疑问：“打起仗来没有指导员能行吗？”编导者干脆就回答：“电影嘛，不能人人都上去，不是有了政委吗！”
    排长王永明气愤地说：不提政委还罢，提起政委叫人气炸肺。当时，叫我演我军指挥所的卫兵，我看见在战局紧急，要下定决心、制定决策的时刻，军政委不是皱眉头，就是转圈子，大不了是着急地搧扇子，象个阿斗似的，插几句不三不四的话，根本是个没有政治头脑的人。影片描写的军政委、团政委，纯粹是丑化、歪曲，是挂我军政治工作人员之名，行取消党的领导、抹煞政治工作之实，主张枪杆子第一，个人权威说了算。
    副科长薛允德揭发说：编导者这种反对党的领导，个人权威第一思想，不仅反映在他们的镜头里，也表现在日常工作、生活当中。当时，我和参谋长李炜政同志负责给他们调动部队，和他们接触较多。他们不把部队党委放在眼里，把整个部队看成是给他们服务的小兵小卒。他们在拍摄过程中，追求什么“国际出口值多少钱的镜头”，单纯强调艺术第一，导演第一，权威第一，根本也不把拍摄组党支部放在眼里，都是一人说了算。他们这样地把党的领导看成眼中钉，怎能会去歌颂党的领导呢？
    营长杨彦才说：我们从参加拍摄影片中看出，编导者不仅有意取消党的领导，还千方百计把我军强有力的政治思想工作一笔抹煞掉。当时，我们营扮演我军主攻部队，我们就感觉到战斗前后的政治思想工作，如战前的动员、诉苦、发扬军事民主，战斗中的宣传、鼓动，战后的评功、祝捷等，一概都被取消了。当时我曾经向编导者提出疑问和建议。而他们却厌烦地说：“那是形式，罗嗦。”难道这是形式吗？我参加过孟良崮战役。当时我在主攻部队的一个营部里当通信员，战斗任务一下来，就开诉苦大会，大家提高了阶级觉悟，全营的请战书、保证书、挑战书堆成堆，同志们的战斗情绪很高，有力地保证了战斗的胜利……。而敌视我军政治工作的编导者，却把我军生动活泼的政治思想工作全部抽掉，把我军写成没有政治方向，没有政治头脑的乌合之众。试问，这样的部队能打胜仗，能有战斗力吗？这样的军队竟能消灭蒋介石的“王牌”整编七十四师，那是令人难以置信的。
    排长王永明说：编导者还对我军瓦解敌军的工作作了极大的歪曲。我军向敌人进行了喊话，这本是强有力的政治攻势，对瓦解敌军起了极大作用，许多不甘心为国民党反动派卖命的士兵听到喊话，自动放下武器，投诚我军。而编导者不顾这些铁的事实，以敌人狡猾的顽抗表现我军喊话的失败，扮演我军的战士们当场就气愤地说：这叫什么政治攻势！喊话喊来的是敌人的子弹头，是我军的伤亡，而敌人却表现得那样顽强，有智慧，虽然最后被我军消灭了，但是却以血淋淋的事实说明了我军瓦解敌军的政治工作失败了。我们还看到，在拍摄影片过程中，编导者对我军的俘虏政策，也进行了恶毒的诬蔑。张灵甫的营长张小甫被俘过来，在我军高级指挥员面前，表现得十分狂妄，连我军军长、参谋长对他都无可奈何。后来，又竟以上山劝降为理由，把他放回去，让他向张灵甫表白效忠主子的赤胆忠心，叫张灵甫把他当场击毙。影片通过这样一俘一放，一劝一毙，进一步说明我军的俘虏政策的彻底失败，同时显示了敌人的坚贞不屈的英雄气节。这实在是诋毁我军政治工作的最恶毒的手段。
    参加拍摄的干部和战士们一致反映：编导者对党和毛主席的领导，对我军政治工作，这样仇视和诬蔑，对敌军又是怎样的呢？编导者站在资产阶级的立场上，反对共产党、毛主席的领导，就必然拥护国民党、蒋介石的领导；他们不突出人民军队的政治，必然突出国民党反动军队的政治。在拍摄影片的过程中，大家看得明，听得清。影片中数次提到“蒋委员长”，“美国顾问团”和“国防部”，不断鼓励张灵甫率三万弟兄，团结一致，“效忠党国”。当他们胜利的时候，宝塔照相，庆功敬酒，大鼓士气；当战斗危急时刻，上下请功，互相鼓励，振奋斗志，甚至在张灵甫“杀身成仁”的前一小时，敌总司令竟乘飞机盘旋于孟良崮上空和张灵甫联络。张灵甫还立正对着话筒喊道：“总司令，总司令！我是灵甫，张灵甫啊！请你训示，请你训示。”报话机立即传来敌总司令的声音：“我在你的上空，我在你的上空。委员长要我向你慰问。这一仗关系重大，务希鼓舞全军，再接再厉！只要再坚持两小时，局面就会改观。”看，敌人的政治工作多么适时有力，多么鼓舞人心，正是这反革命的政治工作，使敌七十四师战斗到最后一兵一卒，直至张灵甫“杀身成仁”。战斗的结果，敌人虽然被我们消灭了，但只不过是一个幌子，敌人在精神上却胜利了，代表大地主大资产阶级的国民党反动派的政治却胜利了。编导者为美化敌人费尽了心血，他们本人确实也象张灵甫那样，通过影片的每一个镜头，为国民党反动派效忠到底。
    妄图抹煞毛泽东思想的光辉，宣扬反动军队的战略战术
    人民战争的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利。解放战争中，在毛泽东思想指引下南征北战过的革命战士，对这一点最清楚不过。可是影片的编导者却把我军写成是一群离开毛泽东思想统帅的乌合之众，一伙单纯为了向敌七十四师报私仇的武装集团。在拍摄过程中，我们的不少干部战士都曾对影片内容有过强烈的反映。他们指出，敌人的八百万军队都被消灭光了。如果影片只告诉人们，消灭了一个小小的七十四师，就没有多大意义。一定要通过孟良崮战役这滴“水”，反映出在整个解放战争中毛泽东思想的光辉。但是，抱定决心要在影片中抹煞毛泽东思想的编导者，顽固地坚持他们的一套，对人民战争的历史进行恣意歪曲。
    政治处副主任唐建源和营长杨彦才说：我们三营担任了扮演我军的任务。影片编导者给我们安排了一场我军大溃退的情景。当时，他们把气氛搞得乌烟瘴气，把环境弄得凄凄惨惨，要我军一个个演得垂头丧气，要群众装得悲伤失望，把我军撤退的队形搞得一团混乱，特别是还要我们不少战士倒背着枪，充分表演出吃了败仗的狼狈象，这就引起了我们和战士们极大的反感。我们曾经提出：“我们是执行毛主席的伟大战略思想作主动转移，决不是溃退！”而他们的回答是：“这里演的是吃了败仗撤退，要的是真实！”什么是历史的真实呢？那就是毛主席的战略思想统帅着我们千军万马，从胜利走向胜利。毛主席在一九四六年提出的集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的思想，不仅在干部中，而且在战士中，早已深入人心，变成广大指战员行动准则。当时部队的宣传队在苏北和山东的许多村镇里，写下了“不在一城一地的得失，就在消灭蒋匪军”的口号。在部队里也流传这样的一首歌子：“运动战，运动战，声东击西南北战，专打敌人的弱点……”这充分说明毛主席的伟大战略思想已为广大指战员所熟悉、所掌握。当时的涟水之战也正是遵照毛主席“以歼灭敌军有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取地方为主要目标”的思想，有计划进行的战略转移。难道是象影片描写的那样，从人民群众到部队官兵，从基层干部到中级干部，甚至到高级干部的政委、军长，都是一伙没有头脑的糊涂蛋？被毛泽东思想武装起来的，具有高度革命英雄主义的战士，在任何强大的敌人面前向来英勇不屈，所向无敌，难道会象影片中描写的那样狼狈逃窜，溃不成军吗？这对毛泽东思想，对人民军队是多么大的侮辱和丑化！
    组织干事金奋起说：编导者的立场是十分鲜明的。他们抹煞和歪曲毛主席的战略思想，却极力突出和描写敌人的战略战术。明明是敌人被毛主席的战略思想所左右，一直被我军牵着鼻子走，被动地钻进我们的“口袋”里；编导者却偏偏突出张灵甫的“英明决策”，表现他们节节进攻，步步主动。拍摄每一个镜头时，我们都发现了编导者的倾向性。例如，拍摄我军的军容风纪，编导者故意丑化我军的队列，帽子可以歪戴，衣扣可以不扣，绑腿可以乱打。开拍时，小旗一摆，象赶羊似地要你在路上奔跑，完全象一股败军的样子。拍摄敌人行军时，却煞费苦心，精雕细琢，唯恐表现不出他们的整齐、威风，突出不了他们的进攻姿态。拍摄敌人的炮兵行进时，编导者摆弄我们的炮兵部队在公路上一次又一次往返演练，炮车之间五米的距离，要求绝对准确，真比阅兵式还要严格！在拍摄敌人步兵行进时，从服装、表情到姿势，他们也观察入微，精心刻划。在一次拍摄敌步兵行进的路上，编导者一个一个仔细检查，有一个“敌人”忘了扎腰带，被编导者检查出来了，立即找来了一条宽腰带要他扎好，威武前进。难道历史的真实是这样吗？敌人在我军“指挥”下进入了解放区，就象钻进了绞索里，处处时时，提心吊胆，又怕地雷，又怕伏击，怎能有那副整齐威武的样子？有抹煞，就有突出。编导者抹煞毛主席伟大战略思想的目的，正是为了大大突出反动派的“英明决策”。这一切安排，完全是编导者阶级立场和阶级感情的真实流露。
    排长王永明说：历史的真实是，毛主席的战略思想调动着敌人，牵着他们的鼻子走，影片编导者却别有用心地全部抹煞，压根不提。反而把张灵甫颂扬为“正面佯攻”“侧翼迂回”“惯于声东击西”的军事家，让我们跟着他的屁股转。把我军诱敌深入，写成是敌人“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”。把我军在沂蒙山区为敌人掘下坟墓的事实，描写成敌人企图“中心开花”歼灭我军的“壮举”。总之，编导者费尽心机，要在我军指战员和广大人民群众心目中，一笔抹掉毛泽东思想的光辉。
    诬蔑我军和人民群众血肉相连的鱼水关系，掩盖国民党反动军队对人民犯下的滔天罪行
    一九六一年六月，参加拍摄影片的部队随编导者来到拍摄现场——山东桃村。这是一个有着光荣的斗争传统的革命老根据地。当地群众听说要拍攻打孟良崮歼灭蒋匪军的影片，都无限振奋。虽然正是麦收大忙时节，他们都象当年解放战争中奋勇支前那样，放下镰刀，扛上担架，牵上毛驴，起五更，翻大山，从几十里外赶来参加拍摄。他们十分盼望把当年军民紧密合作打垮蒋介石反动派的伟大胜利，把毛主席人民战争的光辉思想拍到电影里去！然而，编导者却对我军军民一致的光荣传统作了极大的诬蔑，对人民群众在革命战争中的作用作了恶意的歪曲，相反，又对敌人犯下的滔天罪行作了极力掩饰。
    营长杨彦才说：在编导者眼里，人民群众是无足轻重的小配角。在拍摄人民群众推车送粮支前的一个镜头时，大家满怀热情地往麻袋里填谷草，想把麻袋填得鼓鼓的，把车子装得满满的，好充分表现人民群众积极支前的心愿。但是，有的刚填了几把，编导者就不耐烦地说：“算了吧，装两把就行了，镜头一晃就过去了，谁还看这个！”影片正是按照编导者的意图，除了安排冷冷落落的群众，抬着担架匆匆忙忙一闪而过之外，再也没作什么表现。毛主席说：“兵民是胜利之本。”没有人民群众的支援，革命战争的胜利是不可能的。解放战争中，各地人民在党的领导下，除组织民工积极支援前线外，还组织民兵、地方兵团，配合我军消灭敌人，起了很大作用。回想起我们围攻孟良崮时，群众把自己舍不得吃的粮食先送给部队吃，群众放下自己的庄稼活不干先支援前线。人民群众从人力、物力各方面全力支援革命战争，成为我军全歼敌七十四师的巨大保证。这些铁的事实，编导者在镜头里都不去表现，却把群众丑化说成只图部队帮助收完大秋的人，鼠目寸光、只顾眼前利益、不关心革命战争的人，居心实在阴险！
    战士解永健说：去参加拍摄影片时，我们天天唱《三大纪律八项注意》歌，处处注意发扬我军军民一致的光荣传统，时刻注意遵守和维护群众纪律，编导者却存心歪曲我军自觉遵守群众纪律，爱护人民利益的光荣传统。一次在拍摄我军行军时，明明大路上可以通过，编导者却硬指挥我们扩展到道路两旁的庄稼地行进，踩群众的庄稼。当我们提出我军行军打仗也应该爱护群众的利益时，编导者却以拍摄需要为借口，搪塞说：“踩吧，踩坏了用钱赔嘛！”这里损害和践踏的只是几棵庄稼吗？不！编导者的用心是要我军践踏自己光荣传统，损害人民军队和群众亲密无间的鱼水关系。正是在这个恶毒的用心下，影片中出现的我军指战员，都是些脱离人民、不尊重人民的“老总”。连长石东根便是编导者精心刻划的一个代表。他对待人民群众满腹牢骚，冷冷冰冰，根本不懂得自己是人民的子弟兵，不懂得作好群众工作是我军的三大任务之一。
    副科长薛允德说：编导者在歪曲和诬蔑我军和人民群众的关系的同时，极力掩盖敌人残害人民、掠夺人民的滔天罪行，掩盖国民党反动派和人民之间的尖锐的阶级矛盾。在影片里，那些反革命刽子手是和和善善，规规矩矩。他们不杀一个人，不抓一只鸡，不牵一头牛，不抢一针一线。这般军纪严明、秋毫无犯，哪里还象反动军队！我们知道，敌七十四师，是蒋介石的一支反动透顶的嫡系部队，走到哪里，抢到哪里，烧到哪里，杀到哪里。我有一家亲戚就住在孟良崮附近，一次就被敌七十四师杀死了三口人。敌七十四师被我军赶上孟良崮时，抢红了眼，见鸡抓鸡，见狗抢狗，他们把许多村庄抢杀一空。敌人欠下的累累血债，犯下的桩桩罪行，敌人和人民誓不两立的尖锐阶级矛盾，编导者为什么不去揭露？为什么反而加以掩盖？编导者的立场站到哪里去了？
    歪曲我军官兵一致的原则，颂扬敌人“精诚团结”
    编导者为了全面诋毁毛主席的建军思想，在拍摄影片过程中，对我军官兵一致的原则大加丑化和歪曲，把我军官兵之间描绘得离心离德，矛盾突出，互不团结，把敌人却美化成同心同德，铁板一块。协助和参加拍摄的干部战士，对此十分不满。
    连长李明章说：参加拍摄影片不久，连队进行了十多天的管理教育条例学习，进一步提高了阶级觉悟，改进管理方法，上下团结，亲密无间。可是，大家在拍摄现场看到的我军官兵关系，却令人十分难以容忍。我军连长对上顶抗，毫无礼貌，对下粗暴，蛮不讲理，办事莽撞、武断。战士们看到这个形象都不满地说：“我们的连长哪有这么多的怪毛病！”编导者却解释说：“这是粗犷、憨实的典型性格。”大家听了心里不服，背后议论：什么典型性格，这是土匪、疯子，我们根本没有这样的连长！编导者不仅把石东根丑化成这种可憎的样子，还以种种手法，把我军各级干部都刻划成没有政治头脑，没有阶级感情，一个比一个粗暴的人，军长熊团长，团长熊连长，连长熊班长，班长熊战士，互不信任、互不尊重。试问，这样的干部能够领导打仗？这样的部队能有战斗力？
    战士吕冠民和营长杨彦才说：编导者对我军官兵关系百般丑化，而对敌军官兵关系却满腔热忱地歌颂，二者形成明显对照。有一次，拍摄敌军周旅长率督战队，组织突围的场面，开始拍时，敌人突围不力败退下来，督战队当即开枪阻拦后退，冲锋枪打了个扇面，应声倒下一片敌人，这本是敌军内部矛盾激化的真实反映，在场观看的同志也十分信服。但是，编导者却看在眼里，疼在心里，慌忙下令停止拍。为的啥呢？经他反复解说，大家才明白，原来编导者嫌督战队打死的“弟兄们”太多了，有损于敌七十四师“精诚团结”、“忠心保国”的精神。他亲自导演几次重拍，才变成今天银幕上的景象：只倒下一官一卒。编导者为了颂扬敌军内部关系，就是这般地费尽心机，不放过一切时机，给敌人涂脂抹粉。请看，从张灵甫一伙人宝塔合影到宴会上祝酒庆功，从率师北上到战到一兵一卒，我们听到的是敌人为胜利同声欢笑，看到的是敌人和睦相处，同心协力，“效忠党国”。就连被俘释放后，挨了张灵甫两记耳光的张小甫，在敌人即将全军覆灭的最后时刻，还忠心耿耿地为张灵甫的生命安全和“三万弟兄”的前途，甘愿出一把力。编导者如此丑化我军官兵关系，美化敌军官兵关系的目的何在，难道还不明白吗！
    极力丑化人民军队，精心为反革命分子立传树碑
    毛主席教导我们，革命的文艺要歌颂人民、暴露敌人。而影片《红日》编导者却运用电影艺术的场景、气氛、音响、效果等等一切手段，对我军进行丑化和歪曲，对敌人进行美化和颂扬。
    在参加拍摄过程中驻在编导者住处附近的干部战士们说：那时我们常常听到树林里传出一阵森人的狂笑声，叫人听了浑身就起鸡皮疙瘩。这就是影片中我军连长石东根发出来的笑声。编导者为了把他丑化得象一个疯子一样，竟让演员不停地学练这种嚎叫狂笑。编导者为了侮辱我们人民军队，真是从人物的言语、行动各个侧面都费尽心机。在影片里，我军的战士被描写成：结巴、迷糊、傻瓜、毛三枪，总之是一伙只知道吃饭、瞌睡的草包。我军军长成了愁眉苦脸的败将，军政委成了只会摇扇子的傀儡，团长成了毫无政治头脑的愣头青，连长成了酒鬼、疯子，而排长和他的妻子成了“投军别窑”的薛平贵和王宝钏。一句话，我军没有一个象样的战士，没有一个象样的指挥员，连革命根据地也没有一个象样的群众。这里哪还能说明我们是一支新型的人民军队，是中国人民的优秀儿女呢？我军在毛泽东思想的阳光哺育下，在党的英明领导下，在长期的革命战争中，锻炼培养了无数顶天立地的革命英雄，编导者不加表现，反而是丑化到了使人看不下去的地步。这不正表现了编导者对我军是怀着恨之入骨的感情吗！
    司号长马学和说：编导者在丑化我军同时，还尽心尽力地美化敌人。当时，编导者叫我扮演我军一个号兵，要我在和敌七十四师打响后，立在团指挥所附近，而且要装出一副担心害怕、惊慌不安的样子。在解放战争中，我亲自参加过孟良崮战役，那时也是当号兵，虽然年纪很小，但是为了给全国受压迫的穷人报仇，一听说打仗就抢着向前冲，根本不知道什么叫害怕。这次拍电影倒叫我装孬种，我不干！我坚决拒绝了扮演这个角色。但是，编导者在拍摄敌人的许多镜头里，却把敌人描写得一个个昂首挺胸，雄壮威武。敌七十四师进驻涟水城，活象是在举行一场入城式。张灵甫逃上孟良崮，也镇静自若得象旅行散步一般。更可气的是，编导者要我们一个排去扮演张灵甫的卫士队时，还精挑细选，连个头矮一点的都给剔回来，显然是认为身材不魁伟都不配做敌人的卫士。编导者对国民党的“军威”的爱护，连当年活着的张灵甫也会自愧不如。我不禁要问，这些编导者究竟是一伙什么人？
    指导员高明礼说：拍摄敌军从我军三八五高地突破，我军吃紧时，编导者要我扮演我军团部一个参谋，当我团长急躁地大喊：要炮兵支援时，叫我握着话筒站在一旁，一会儿这样站，一会儿那样站，演得象热锅上的蚂蚁一样惊慌万状。这显然是恶意丑化我军。当时我就说：“我是解放军，学不会这个表情！”拒绝扮演了。编导者对我军这样丑化，对敌人呢？那却是万般美化！我们的参谋张洪坤同志被叫去扮演敌人的参谋，表演当我军快攻上孟良崮主峰时，他们一伙在大吃罐头的情景，张洪坤同志表演的“敌参谋”连怕加渴，大口吞吃，描绘出了一派惊慌神色。这本来就是敌人的真实的写照，但是，当时编导者却马上制止他，要他文雅点，镇静点。编导的爱憎多么分明，手法又是多么险毒啊！
    副科长张献耀和排长王永明说：编导者还设法动用敌人的嘴，我军的嘴，俘虏的嘴，人民群众的嘴一齐颂扬敌人，一捧一吹，一赞一颂，互相配合，长敌人的志气，灭我军的威风。你看，一个镜头：解放战士马步生说：“打七十四师可不是闹玩的！……人家都是美式装备啊！”一个镜头：我军战士张德来说：“嗬！这么多炮弹，象下……下饺子一样。”一个镜头：张灵甫说：“什么口袋阵、八卦阵，不要把共产党说得太神了！”一个镜头：我军军长沈振新说：“张灵甫是惯于声东击西的！”总之，影片中的一切都为了突出敌人的威武、顽强、忠诚，影片中的一切都在为塑造敌七十四师这支“英雄”的部队和张灵甫这个“英雄”人物服务。直到张灵甫被击毙时，宝塔下的照片还是完整的，只是玻璃碎了一点。编导者的用意，我们一目了然。他们要说的意思不过是：张灵甫虽然死了，但是他的精神，却要象宝塔一样万世长存。
    为被推翻的国民党反动派效忠
    参加拍摄的干部和战士们说：张灵甫死后，蒋介石为了欺骗他的走狗为自己的反革命统治效劳，曾经在南京玄武湖边给张灵甫立了纪念碑，解放后，很快就被人民群众毁掉了。可是，编导者却阴谋要通过《红日》这部影片，为屠杀人民的刽子手重新树起“纪念碑”，为国民党反动军队写赞美诗。编导者完全站在国民党反动派的立场上，效忠于已经被推翻的大地主大资产阶级。影片《红日》是一棵彻头彻尾反党反社会主义的大毒草，是一支阴险凶恶的反毛泽东思想的毒箭！我们必须彻底揭露它，清算它，不达目的，决不罢休！
