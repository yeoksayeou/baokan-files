    Mao Zedong Thought is Fundamental
    Xin Wu
    The fortress of Peking Opera, a classical Chinese art form, was breached in the last three years; the fortresses of foreign classical arts like ballet, symphony, and sculpture, were also breached in the last three years. In the same period, a group of good examples of making the past serve the present and foreign things serve China were established, and were approved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is a new phenomenon in the socialist cultural revolution.
    Why were these fortresses of Chinese and foreign classical art breached in these three years? There is a profound reason for this. That is: to thoroughly destroy bourgeois ideology, it is impossible to do without Mao Zedong Thought; to greatly establish proletarian ideology, it is also impossible to do without Mao Zedong Thought. Only with Mao Zedong Thought in command can we destroy well and establish well; only then can we destroy thoroughly and establish clearly.
    Our Peking Opera was once considered the "most stubborn fortress." This fortress has now been breached, and outstanding revolutionary modern Peking Operas such as "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "Raid on the White Tiger Regiment" have emerged. Sculpture, whether Chinese or foreign, used to serve the bourgeoisie and the feudal landlord class. Now, a great revolution has taken place, and brand-new revolutionary clay sculptures like "The Rent Collection Courtyard" have appeared. Foreign music like symphony has also undergone a revolution, and excellent works like the symphonic "Shajiabang" have emerged. These revolutionary artistic flowers are blossoming under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought.
    The ballet dramas "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" are also flowers blossoming in this way.
    Ballet is a foreign dance that serves the foreign bourgeoisie and has long been solidified, and is not popular with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in our country. Our dance workers have studied Chairman Mao's works and understand that our revolutionary literature and art should serve the greatest number of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve proletarian politics. Their thinking has been revolutionized, so they dare to revolutionize and dare to break foreign conventions, and give ballet revolutionary new content and new forms of expression, and have achieved great success.
    But why couldn't we break through in the past? Now it is also very clear: under the control or influence of an anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, someone would come out to intercept the attack on those Chinese and foreign classical art fortresses. Didn't the bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" frighten us? Saying that those Chinese and foreign antiques were all "treasures," and that they could not be broken, and that breaking them would cause chaos, and that nothing could be established after breaking them. Their purpose in frightening us in this way was nothing more than to resist Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, and to continue to use these antiques to publicize bourgeois and feudal ideas, and dig at the "foundation" of socialism.
    Of course, this did not frighten us or stop us. In the three years of the socialist cultural revolution, we held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with destruction as the priority, and destroyed the fortresses on a large scale. We destroyed the old Peking Opera, and there was no chaos; we destroyed the foreign ballet, and there was no chaos; we destroyed sculpture and symphony, and there was no chaos. We can not only destroy, but also establish, and establish well. Revolutionary modern Peking Opera, revolutionary ballet dramas, revolutionary sculpture, and other new and excellent arts, have they not all been established after being greatly destroyed? This is very contrary to the wishes of these gentlemen. It seems that these gentlemen do not understand the truth that "people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power," and they will always be bruised and battered. And we, the revolutionary literary and art workers, as long as we continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and bravely advance, we will be invincible and all-conquering, and make new contributions in the great socialist cultural revolution.

    毛泽东思想是根本
    辛午
    京剧这个中国古典艺术堡垒，是最近三年中攻破的；芭蕾舞、交响乐、雕塑这些外国古典艺术堡垒，也是最近三年中攻破的。在同一个时期中，树立了一批古为今用和外为中用的好样板，并且被广大工农兵群众批准了。这是社会主义文化大革命中的新鲜事。
    这些中外古典艺术堡垒，为什么都在这三年中连攻皆破？其中有深刻的道理。那就是：要大破资产阶级思想，离开了毛泽东思想不行；要大立无产阶级思想，离开了毛泽东思想也不行。只有毛泽东思想挂帅，我们才能破得好，立得好；才能破得彻底，立得鲜明。
    我国的京剧曾经被认为是“最顽固的堡垒”，这个堡垒现在被攻破了，出现了象《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《智取威虎山》、《奇袭白虎团》等这样的优秀的革命现代京剧。雕塑，不管是洋的还是土的，它们过去是为资产阶级和封建地主阶级服务的，现在也来了一场大革命，出现了象《收租院》这样的崭新的革命泥塑。交响乐这样的洋音乐，现在也经历了革命，出现了交响乐《沙家浜》这样的优秀作品。这些革命的艺术鲜花，都是在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下开放出来的。
    芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》也是这样开放出来的鲜花。
    芭蕾舞是为外国资产阶级服务的、早已凝固化了的洋舞蹈，不为我国广大工农兵群众所喜闻乐见。我国舞蹈工作者学习了毛主席的著作，懂得了我们的革命文艺应该为最大多数的工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的道理。他们的思想革命化了，就敢于革命，敢于打破洋框框，而赋予芭蕾以革命的新的内容，新的表现形式，获得了极大的成功。
    可是，过去为什么攻不动呢？现在也可以看得很清楚：在一条反党反社会主义的黑线控制或影响下，要去攻那些中外古典艺术堡垒，就会有人出来拦截。资产阶级的“权威”和“专家”，不是吓唬过我们吗？说那些中外古董都是“宝贝”，破不得，破了会出乱子，破了也立不起来。他们这样吓唬我们，目的无非是抵制毛泽东文艺思想，继续利用这些古董来宣扬资产阶级和封建思想，挖社会主义的“墙脚”。
    当然，这并没有吓住我们，拦住我们。在这三年社会主义文化大革命中，我们高举毛泽东思想的红旗，破字当头，大破堡垒。旧京剧，我们破了，并没有出乱子；洋芭蕾，我们破了，也没有出乱子；雕塑和交响乐，我们也都破了，也都没有出乱子。我们不但能破，而且能立，而且破得好，立得好。革命的现代京剧，革命的芭蕾舞剧，革命的雕塑等这些新的优秀的艺术，不都是在大破之后大立起来的吗？这是很违反这些先生们的愿望的。看来，这些先生们不懂得“用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力”这一真理，他们总是会碰得头破血流的。而我们，革命的文艺工作者，只要继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗奋勇前进，我们就会战无不胜，攻无不破，在伟大的社会主义文化大革命中，做出新的贡献。
