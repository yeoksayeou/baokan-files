    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana on the 4th, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 4th, stating: The visit of the Albanian Party and Government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu to China is a historically significant event on the road to further strengthening the militant friendship and fraternal cooperation between our two peoples. The extremely solemn and warm welcome given by the fraternal Chinese people to the envoys of the Albanian people, and the cordial talks held by our delegation with Chinese leaders in a spirit of complete mutual understanding, are a shining manifestation of the profound friendship and deep respect of the fraternal Chinese people for the Albanian people and the Albanian Party of Labor.
    This visit once again proves the profound fraternal relations between our two peoples and countries, and demonstrates the correctness and strength of the lofty principles of Marxism-Leninism and internationalist solidarity that our two countries follow.
    The editorial, entitled "The People's Republic of China is the Defender of the Freedom and Independence of All Peoples, a Powerful Factor for International Security," said that the Albanian people are watching the leap forward development of the People's Republic of China in all aspects with special joy and extreme admiration. The Albanian Party of Labor and the government fully support the correct and principled foreign policy pursued by the People's Republic of China.
    The editorial said: "The People's Republic of China has now become a powerful country in the world. Because it implements a correct, principled, and revolutionary policy, it enjoys increasing international prestige and authority. It has now become an invincible fortress of peace and international security, a powerful pillar of the world revolutionary movement and liberation movement, and an insurmountable obstacle to prevent the hostile plans of imperialists and modern revisionists from succeeding. Therefore, China is loved and greatly respected by all progressive people in the world on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is crazily hated and opposed by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries in the world."
    The editorial said: "The victory of the Chinese revolution changed the old balance of power, making it favorable to socialism and freedom, and the imperialist positions, especially on the Asian continent, suffered devastating blows. The victory of the Chinese revolution has become an example for the liberation movement and anti-imperialist democratic liberation movement in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and it is also a source of inspiration for these movements. The Chinese revolution has placed socialist China at the forefront of human social development. It was and is a powerful pillar for realizing the revolutionary ideals of mankind. It is a guiding light, pointing out to the people of other countries in the world the path to be followed to realize a bright future."
    The editorial quoted Comrade Hoxha as saying that the People's Republic of China is "a great factor for socialism and a powerful factor for peace and international security"; it resolutely pursues an anti-imperialist revolutionary policy.
    The editorial said that the policy pursued by the People's Republic of China is not based on unprincipled compromises and concessions that are beneficial to imperialism, but on the basis of firmly opposing imperialism. The great strength of socialist New China lies mainly in the correct principles of the revolutionary policy it unswervingly pursues, in its unwavering loyalty to the cause of the people of all countries, to the cause of peace, socialism, and revolution, in its support for the liberation struggle against oppression and exploitation, and in its resolute struggle against imperialism and revisionism.
    The editorial pointed out that China resolutely opposes the aggression and war policy of U.S. imperialism, firmly advocates genuine and effective equality between all countries, large and small, and defends the important principle of safeguarding national sovereignty. China strongly opposes the attempt of the two major powers to dominate the world, manipulate the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and extinguish the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. China is the best friend and most reliable supporter of the people of all countries who oppose aggression and oppression, and the irreconcilable enemy of all aggressors and oppressors.
    The editorial said: "Communists and true revolutionaries all over the world are grateful to the Chinese Communist Party, because the Chinese Communist Party consistently adheres to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and stands at the forefront of the current historically significant struggle against modern revisionism, defending Marxism-Leninism, and enabling Marxism-Leninism to win. The Chinese Communist Party, with a lofty spirit of uncompromising principles and an exemplary and inspiring determination, has made a decisive contribution to this struggle by exposing all traitors and enemies of Marxism-Leninism, and is accelerating the ideological and political bankruptcy of modern revisionism, especially Khrushchev revisionism. This is a historical fact of particular significance."
      "The Chinese Communist Party has exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionist leaders, pointing out that they have nothing in common with Marxism-Leninism, and that what they dream of is nothing more than US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world."
    The editorial said that when the imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists attempted to obstruct and undermine our country's socialist construction and undermine our country's national independence, and when we were in a particularly difficult situation, the fraternal Chinese people stood with us. This is a lofty example of proletarian internationalist solidarity.
    The editorial pointed out that U.S. imperialists have long openly pursued an anti-China policy. The spearhead of their counter-revolutionary global strategy is now directed at Asia, especially socialist China, and they are attempting to build a "ring of encirclement" around China. In pursuing this policy, U.S. imperialists have received active support from the Khrushchev revisionists. For the sake of "US-Soviet cooperation" and the notorious coexistence, the Khrushchev revisionists have repeatedly proven to have embarked on the road of betraying the revolutionary people of all countries and the interests of socialism. However, the Chinese people, who have blazed a path of freedom and progress in the victorious revolutionary storm, are not afraid of imperialist threats and blackmail. The Chinese people love peace, but are not afraid of war. They are ready to deal with any possible and sudden attack by U.S. imperialism. They are determined to wage a just struggle against the aggressors, and are determined to contribute decisively to eliminating the war monger U.S. imperialism, together with the people of the world. Historical facts have shown that no matter how desperately and rampantly U.S. imperialism is hostile to the people of all countries and peace, and no matter how modern revisionists and reactionaries of all countries serve and support it, there is no force in the world that can enable U.S. imperialism to escape its inevitable demise. U.S. imperialism is bound to fail. The cause of justice will prevail. This is the verdict of history.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》盛赞中阿友谊和中国外交政策
    中国是世界革命和解放运动的强大支柱
    中共坚决揭露马列主义的叛徒和敌人，加速了现代修正主义的破产
    据新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》四日发表社论说：由穆罕默德·谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国，是在我们两国人民之间的战斗友谊和兄弟合作进一步加强的道路上的一个具有历史意义的事件。兄弟的中国人民给予阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者的十分隆重和热烈的欢迎，和我国代表团同中国领导人本着完全相互了解的精神所进行的亲切会谈，是兄弟的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的深厚情谊和深深尊敬的光辉表现。
    这次访问再一次证明了我们两国人民和两国之间的深厚的兄弟关系，证明了我们两国所遵循的马克思列宁主义和国际主义团结的崇高原则的正确性和力量。
    这篇题为《中华人民共和国是各国人民自由和独立的捍卫者，是国际安全的强大因素》的社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着特别高兴和极为钦佩的心情注视着中华人民共和国在各方面的飞跃发展。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府完全支持中华人民共和国所奉行的正确的和有原则的外交政策。
    社论说：“中华人民共和国现在已经成为一个世界上强大的国家。由于它执行正确的、有原则的和革命的政策，它享有日益增长的国际威信和权威。它现在已经成为和平和国际安全的不可战胜的堡垒，成为世界革命运动和解放运动的强大支柱，是使帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的敌对计划不能得逞的不可逾越的障碍。因此，中国一方面受到世界上所有的进步人民的爱戴和极大的尊敬，另一方面它又受到世界上帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派的疯狂的憎恨和反对。”
    社论说：“中国革命的胜利改变了旧的力量对比，使其有利于社会主义和自由，使帝国主义阵地，特别是在亚洲大陆上，遭到了粉碎性的打击。中国革命的胜利已经成为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的解放运动和反帝民主解放运动的榜样，也是使这些运动受到鼓舞的泉源。中国的革命使社会主义的中国站在人类社会发展的最前列，它过去和现在都是实现人类的革命理想的强有力的支柱，它是指路明灯，向世界其他各国人民指明了为实现美好的未来所应遵循的道路。”
    社论援引霍查同志的话说，中华人民共和国是“社会主义的伟大因素，是和平与国际安全的一个强大因素”；它坚决地奉行反帝的革命政策。
    社论说，中华人民共和国所奉行的政策，不是建立在有利于帝国主义的无原则的妥协和让步的基础之上的，而是建立在坚定地反对帝国主义这一基础之上的。社会主义新中国的伟大力量主要是在于它坚持不渝地奉行的革命政策的正确原则，在于它毫不动摇地忠于各国人民的事业、忠于和平、社会主义和革命的事业，在于它对反对压迫和剥削的解放斗争的支持，在于它为反对帝国主义和修正主义而进行坚决的斗争。
    社论指出，中国坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，坚决主张所有大小国家之间的真正和有效的平等，维护国家主权这一重要原则。中国坚强有力地反对两大国主宰世界，操纵联合国干涉别国的内政，和扑灭各国人民的革命斗争的企图。中国是反对侵略和压迫的各国人民的最好的朋友和他们的最可靠的支持者，是所有侵略者和压迫者的不共戴天的敌人。
    社论说：“全世界的共产党人和真正的革命者都感激中国共产党，因为中国共产党贯彻始终地忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，站在目前在世界范围内进行的反对现代修正主义、捍卫马克思列宁主义和使马克思列宁主义获胜的具有重要历史意义的斗争的最前列。中国共产党以崇高的不妥协的原则精神和堪称典范的、令人振奋的坚决态度，揭露所有马克思列宁主义的叛徒和敌人，对这一斗争作出了决定性的贡献，并且正在加速现代修正主义、特别是赫鲁晓夫修正主义思想上和政治上的破产，这是一个具有特别重大意义的历史事实。”
      “中国共产党揭露了苏联修正主义领导人的真正面目，指出了他们同马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处，他们梦寐以求的，只不过是美苏合作主宰世界。”
    社论说，当帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者企图阻挠和破坏我国的社会主义建设、损害我国的民族独立，我们处境特别困难的时候，兄弟的中国人民就同我们站在一起。这是无产阶级国际主义团结的一个崇高的典范。
    社论指出，美帝国主义者长期以来公开推行反华政策。他们的反革命全球战略的矛头现在已经转向亚洲、特别是社会主义中国，他们正企图在中国周围建立一道“包围圈”。美帝国主义者在推行这一政策方面，得到了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的积极支持。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了“苏美合作”和臭名远扬的共处，已经多次证明走上了出卖各国革命人民和社会主义利益的道路。但是在胜利的革命风暴中闯出了自由和进步的道路的中国人民是不怕帝国主义的威胁和讹诈的。中国人民热爱和平，但是并不害怕战争。他们已经做好对付美帝国主义的任何可能的和突然进攻的准备，他们已经下定决心进行反对侵略者的正义斗争，并且决心同世界各国人民一起，对消灭战争贩子美帝国主义作出决定性的贡献。历史事实已经表明，不管美帝国主义是怎样绝望地和猖狂地与各国人民和和平为敌，也不管现代修正主义者和各国反动派是怎样为它效劳和助威，世界上都没有任何力量能够使美帝国主义逃脱不可避免的灭亡。美帝国主义必败。正义的事业必胜。这就是历史的判决。
