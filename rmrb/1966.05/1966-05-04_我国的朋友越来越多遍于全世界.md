    Comrade Chen Yi said at the reception held by the CPPCC to welcome overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and ethnic minority delegations:
    Our Friends are Increasing All Over the World
    The truly isolated are U.S. imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and the Soviet revisionist clique, who are opposed by their own people and the people of the world.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 3rd) The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a reception this afternoon to welcome more than 800 overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and 15 ethnic minority delegations comprising more than 30 ethnic groups, who came to Beijing to participate in the "May 1st" International Labor Day celebrations.
    Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, Gao Chongmin, Cai Tingkai, Fu Zuoyi, Teng Daiyuan, Shen Yanbing, Xu Deheng, and Li Dequan, Vice Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee; and Ping Jiesan, Secretary-General of the CPPCC National Committee, attended the reception.
    Mr. Li Zongren also attended the reception.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi spoke at the reception. He extended a warm welcome to the patriotic overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and representatives of all fraternal ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the "May 1st" International Labor Day celebrations. In his speech, he spoke glowingly about the excellent situation in the country. He said that our great motherland is much stronger than in the past, and our domestic socialist revolution and socialist construction are developing by leaps and bounds.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the people of the whole country are full of confidence, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance, and building their own motherland. Our development has a solid and strong foundation. No force in the world, no matter how powerful, no matter how imperialism and reactionaries of all countries collude together to oppose China, can stop our great motherland from advancing. The era when Chinese people could not hold their heads high in front of foreigners has passed forever.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that some public opinions in the United States and Western countries say that "China is isolated," and U.S. Secretary of State Rusk is also clamoring that China's foreign policy has "failed." We can clearly answer them that China's foreign policy is correct, we have not failed, and our friends are increasing. China adheres to the policy of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, adheres to the policy of assisting oppressed nations in gaining independence, adheres to the policy of peaceful coexistence with countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America with different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles, and adheres to the policy of carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction at home. Such a policy has won the support of the people of the whole country and the praise of the people of the world. Our credibility is getting higher and higher, which is a definite fact. The anti-China stance of imperialism and a small handful of people cannot change this fact. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "Our friends are all over the world." Mr. Rusk said: "China is isolated." I am the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, and I have no sense of isolation at all. The question arises, who is isolated? This is a big question.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi immediately replied: The truly isolated are U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of all countries. We view the question of isolation from the standpoint of the masses of people all over the world. China is sympathized with and supported by the people of all countries in the world. China's diplomatic relations with various countries have greatly developed in recent years. There are now forty-eight countries that have established diplomatic relations with China, and more than one hundred countries and regions have established economic, trade, and cultural friendly relations with our country. From these aspects, China's friends are increasing, and our friends are all over the world.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi continued, some countries' domestic people oppose their country's foreign policy. For example, the American people oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. The American people constantly hold demonstrations against American aggression against Vietnam, and many American soldiers are unwilling to go to South Vietnam to die. This proves that U.S. imperialism's aggressive policy isolates itself. The truly isolated is U.S. imperialism, which is opposed by the people of the world. The Soviet revisionist clique attempts to seek peace with U.S. imperialism and collude with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world. Such a policy is unpopular. It is opposed by the people of its own country and the people of the world. It also puts itself in an isolated position. We believe that the great Soviet people will not allow the revisionist clique to manipulate them.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people rely on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and the unity of 700 million people itself is not isolation.
    In his speech, he expressed his gratitude to the patriotic overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and fraternal ethnic groups for their contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi encouraged everyone not to be complacent with the achievements we have made. He said that there are still many shortcomings in our work, and there are still many difficulties in the road ahead, which require us to continue to work hard to overcome. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and strive to achieve greater achievements. He proposed a toast to the development of our great motherland, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in the country.
    Also attending the reception were Liu Shuzhou and Zhang Jingwu, Deputy Ministers of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee; members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; members of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC; Fang Fang and Xie Fumin of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, and the Nationalities Affairs Committee; and Hu Juewen, Wang Shao'ao, Ji Fang, Chen Qiyou, Su Ziheng, Zhu Xuefan, Liu Qingyang, Luo Shuzhang, and Fang Gao, responsible persons of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other relevant units.
    The reception was filled with an atmosphere of close unity. More than a thousand people, including overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, representatives of all fraternal ethnic groups, and people from all walks of life in the capital, gathered together and frequently toasted the great unity of the people of the whole country, the development of the socialist construction cause of the motherland, and the health of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities. Capital literary and art workers performed acrobatic, song, and modern Peking opera performances during the reception.

    陈毅同志在政协欢迎华侨、港澳同胞和各族参观团酒会上说
    我国的朋友越来越多遍于全世界
    真正孤立的是美帝国主义、各国反动派和苏联修正主义集团，它们遭到了本国人民和全世界人民的反对。
    新华社三日讯　政协全国委员会今天下午举行酒会，欢迎来北京参加“五一”国际劳动节的八百多名华侨、港澳同胞和包括三十多个民族的十五个少数民族参观团。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理、政协全国委员会副主席陈毅，政协全国委员会副主席叶剑英、徐冰、高崇民、蔡廷锴、傅作义、滕代远、沈雁冰、许德珩、李德全，政协全国委员会秘书长平杰三等出席了酒会。
    李宗仁先生也出席了酒会。
    陈毅副总理在酒会上讲了话。他向来北京参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝活动的爱国侨胞、港澳同胞和各兄弟民族的代表表示热烈欢迎。他在讲话中畅谈了国内的大好形势。他说，我们伟大的祖国比过去强大得多了，我们国内的社会主义革命和社会主义建设正在飞跃发展。
    陈毅副总理指出，全国人民正在满怀信心，发扬自力更生精神，建设自己的祖国。我们的发展有着坚实和强大的基础。世界上没有任何力量，不管它多么强大，不管帝国主义和各国反动派如何纠集在一起进行反华，绝不能阻止我们伟大的祖国前进。中国人在外国人面前抬不起头来的时代，已经永远过去了。
    陈毅副总理说，美国和西方国家的一些舆论说“中国孤立了”，美国国务卿腊斯克也在叫嚷说，中国的外交政策“失败了”。我们可以明确地回答他们，中国外交政策是正确的，我们并没有失败，我们的朋友越来越多。中国坚持反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的政策，坚持援助被压迫民族获得独立的政策，坚持对亚非拉不同社会制度的国家在五项原则的基础上实行和平共处的政策，坚持在国内进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的政策，这样的政策获得了全国人民的拥护和全世界人民的称赞。我们的信誉越来越高，这是确切的事实。帝国主义和一小撮人的反华，决不能改变这一事实。毛泽东主席说：“我们的朋友遍于全世界”。腊斯克先生说：“中国孤立了”。我是中国的外交部长，我丝毫没有孤立的感觉，这问题就发生了，究竟是谁被孤立呢？这倒是个大问题。
    陈毅副总理立即回答说：真正孤立的是美帝国主义和各国反动派。孤立不孤立的问题，我们是站在全世界人民群众的观点和立场上来看的。中国受到世界各国人民的同情和支持，中国同各国的外交关系近年来有了很大的发展，现在同中国建立了外交关系的国家有四十八个，有一百多个国家和地区同我国建立了经济、贸易和文化友好关系。从这些方面来看，中国的朋友越来越多，我们的朋友遍于全世界。
    陈毅副总理接着说，有些国家的国内人民反对他们本国的外交政策。譬如，美国人民反对美帝国主义侵略越南，美国人民不断举行反对美国侵略越南的示威游行，许多美国士兵不愿去南越送死。这证明了美帝国主义的侵略政策自己把它自己孤立起来了。真正孤立的是美帝国主义，它遭到了全世界人民的反对。苏联修正主义集团企图向美帝国主义求和，伙同美帝国主义主宰世界。这样的政策是不得人心的，它遭到了本国人民和全世界人民的反对，它同样也是把它自己陷于孤立的地位。我们相信伟大的苏联人民是不会任凭修正主义集团的摆布的。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民依靠马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，有七亿人口的团结，这本身就不是孤立的。
    他在讲话中表示感谢爱国侨胞、港澳同胞和兄弟民族对祖国社会主义革命和社会主义建设所作的贡献。
    陈毅副总理勉励大家不要为我们所取得的成绩而自满。他说，我们工作中还有很多缺点，在前进道路上还有很多困难，需要我们继续努力去克服。我们要听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，按毛主席的指示办事，为取得更大的成就而奋斗。他提议为我们伟大祖国的发展，为全国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康，干杯。
    出席酒会的，还有中共中央统一战线工作部副部长刘述周、张经武，人大常委会委员，政协常委会委员，华侨事务委员会、人大常委会民族委员会、民族事务委员会，各民主党派、人民团体和其他有关单位的负责人方方、谢扶民、丹彤、连贯、胡厥文、王绍鏊、季方、陈其尤、苏子蘅、朱学范、刘清扬、罗叔章、方皋等。
    酒会上洋溢着亲密团结的气氛，海外侨胞、港澳同胞、各兄弟民族代表和首都各界人士一千多人欢聚一堂，大家频频为全国人民的大团结，为祖国社会主义建设事业的发展，为各民族人民伟大领袖毛主席的健康而干杯。首都文艺工作者在酒会进行过程中表演了杂技、歌曲、现代京剧等精采节目。
