    Translator's note: The Johnson administration's repeated defeats in its aggressive policy towards Vietnam have plunged it deeper and deeper into a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. Since the beginning of this year, its "dry season offensive" on the South Vietnamese battlefield has suffered heavy blows, with casualties exceeding the total for the entire previous year. The dramatic turmoil and escalating deterioration of the Saigon political situation have also thwarted Johnson's plans to "stabilize" the puppet regime. At the same time, within the United States, popular opposition to the war of aggression in Vietnam and disputes within the American ruling group have intensified. All of this has made Johnson's days even more difficult. The following excerpts from three reports in the American press and news agencies prove this point.
	      Annoyance, Impatience, Helplessness
    Mr. Johnson, annoyed, impatient, and even feeling helpless, may find that he is facing a turning point in postwar affairs.
    It seems that the world no longer accepts American leadership. Domestically, voters may be increasingly annoyed and impatient.
    Of course, the endless war is a growing source of unease. So-called allies who demand much and contribute little are another source of unease.
    The conscription of young people, although limited, causes worry and unease for almost every family with young people of draft age.
    At present, the Vietnam War is the main setback.
    The letters received by the White House and Congress help explain the growing concern about the war issue and the rising casualty figures. Parents repeatedly ask: "Why are we participating in this war? Who benefits if my son is killed? What danger is this country (the United States) in?"
    Obviously, the public is increasingly uneasy about the reasons for participating in this war.

	      Whistling in the Dark Passing a Graveyard to Boost Courage
    America's efforts to achieve political stability in South Vietnam may, in the long run, prove more troublesome than waging war against the North.
    This view was expressed by this agency's diplomatic correspondent, Stuart Hensley, at this agency's eighth annual breakfast meeting.
    Hensley said, referring to Vietnam and the situation in the coming months, "The Johnson administration seems to be whistling in the dark passing a graveyard to boost its courage, to cover up its fear of the potential unknown political dangers ahead."
    On this point, Smith (United Press International White House correspondent) said at the meeting that the next six months are likely to be the most troublesome time of President Johnson's term.
    Hensley said that the United States may be on a road of no return leading to a dilemma.
    In his speech on President Johnson's term of office in the next six months, Smith said that Johnson "is well aware" that the next few months may be difficult, "which may be why he has recently seemed less emotionally vibrant than before."
                          ——United Press International dispatch of April 25
  	        "The Lowest Ebb of the White House Career"
    There are signs that Johnson has begun to be annoyed by what some observers call a "peak of criticism." With increasing problems abroad and at home, Johnson seems to have reached or approached the lowest ebb of his career in the White House to date.
    When Johnson went to Houston, his remarks asking Americans to "be restrained and united" reflected his growing unease about the criticism of the Vietnam War.
    This unease permeated his speech. Johnson seemed to think that the criticism from liberals and intellectuals was directed less at the war itself than at Lyndon Johnson, the "country bumpkin" from Texas; he was very angry about their talk about his style or supposed lack of style.
    He is clearly concerned that increasing criticism may eventually make it impossible for him to fight the current war, which makes him feel increasingly frustrated.
    Of course, the President continues to be busy. Policymakers are considering the issues of the disintegration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the trend of U.S.-Soviet reconciliation. But, above all, the grim curtain cast by the Vietnam issue and the unease it causes in Congress.

### 约翰逊内外交困日子难过

专栏：外论摘要

    约翰逊内外交困日子难过
    译者注：约翰逊政府侵越政策的连遭惨败，使它越来越深地陷入了无法自拔的困境中。今年以来，它在南越战场上发动的“旱季攻势”遭到沉重的打击，伤亡人数超过去年全年；西贡政局的剧烈动荡和日益恶化，又使约翰逊“稳定”傀儡政权的计划落空。与此同时，在美国国内，人民反对侵越战争的情绪和美国统治集团内部的争吵更加激烈。这一切，都使约翰逊的日子更加难过。这里摘译发表的美国报刊和通讯社的三篇报道，证明了这一点。	      烦恼、急躁、手足无措
    烦恼、急躁、甚至感到手足无措的约翰逊先生，也许发现他所面临的，是战后时期事务的一个转折点。
    看来，世界不再接受美国的领导。在国内，选民们也许日益烦恼，愈来愈急躁。
    当然，没有止境的战争，是日益增长的一种不安。要求多，贡献少的所谓盟友，则是另一种不安。
    对青年的入伍征召，尽管有限，但是对几乎一切有适龄青年的家庭说来，都引起忧虑和不安。
    在目前，越南战争是主要的挫折。
    白宫和国会所收到的信件，有助于解释对战争问题和不断上升的伤亡数字的日益关注。父母们一再问道：“我们为什么要参加这场战争？如果我的儿子被打死了，对谁有好处？这个国家（美国）处在什么危险情况下？”
    显然，公众对参加这场战争的原因，越来越感到不安了。
            ——四月二十五日《美国新闻与世界报道》	      黑夜过坟场吹口哨壮胆
    美国谋求使南越政治上稳定的努力，从长远看，可能证明比对北方进行战争更麻烦。
    这个看法是本社外交记者斯图尔特·汉斯莱在本社第八次每年一度的早餐会上发表的。
    汉斯莱提到越南和今后几个月的情况时说：“约翰逊政府看来是在黑夜过坟墓吹口哨壮胆，以掩饰自己害怕今后潜在着的未知的政治危险。”
    关于这一点，史密斯（合众国际社白宫记者）在会上说，今后六个月很可能是约翰逊总统任期中最伤脑筋的时间。
    汉斯莱说，美国可能正在一条通向两难处境的有往无来的道路上。
    史密斯在他的关于约翰逊总统任期的今后六个月时间的讲话中说，约翰逊“十分明白”，今后几个月可能是很难的，“这可能是他最近时候看来不如以前那么感情焕发的原因。”
                          ——合众国际社四月二十五日电讯
  	        “白宫事业的最低潮”
    有迹象表明，约翰逊已经开始对一些观察家们所谓的“批评高潮”感到恼怒。由于国外国内问题越来越多，约翰逊似乎达到了或是接近于他到目前为止在白宫的事业的最低潮。
    在约翰逊到休斯敦去的时候，他的要求美国人“持重和团结”的发言，反映了他对越南战争受到的批评日益不安。
    这种不安渗透了他的讲话。约翰逊似乎认为，自由派和知识分子的批评有些与其说是针对这场战争，不如说是针对林登·约翰逊这个得克萨斯州“乡下佬”；他对他们关于他的风格或是所谓的没有风格的谈论非常愤怒。
    他显然担心，越来越多的批评最后可能使他不可能打目前这场战争，这使得他越来越感到受到了挫折。
    当然，总统继续忙忙碌碌。政策制订者们考虑北大西洋公约组织分崩离析和美苏和解的动向问题。但是，超乎一切的是越南问题所笼罩的阴森布幕和它在国会引起的不安。
