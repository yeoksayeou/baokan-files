    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th May: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 6th, strongly condemning the Thai ruling clique's decision to send naval and air forces to help US imperialism invade Vietnam.

    The statement said that this is a new action by the Thai Thanom-Praphas ruling clique to further participate in the US war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The statement pointed out that this action was taken under the orders of the United States, which is demanding that its servants provide troops to intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina. This action further exposes the Thanom-Praphas ruling clique as a very faithful lackey of the United States. This clique is prepared to exchange the blood of Thai youth for US dollars to enrich themselves. It has completely betrayed the interests of the Thai people, sold out their national sovereignty and security, opposed the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation, and undermined peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    The statement said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that US imperialism and its running dogs immediately stop sending Thai mercenaries to South Vietnam and withdraw all US and puppet troops, as well as weapons and other war materials, from there.

    The statement said that if the Thanom-Praphas ruling clique deliberately acts on the orders of the United States and continues to take hostile actions against the Vietnamese people, it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th May: The Vietnamese newspaper *Nhân Dân* (People's Daily) published a commentary on the 6th, severely condemning the Thai reactionary authorities' brazen decision to send naval and air forces to South Vietnam to serve the US imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The commentary in *Nhân Dân* pointed out that this is a new action by the Thai reactionary authorities to participate in the US war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The commentary said that no matter what kind of assistance the Thai reactionary authorities or other groups of US running dogs provide, they cannot save the United States from defeat in Vietnam. The Thai reactionary authorities stubbornly follow the United States and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat together with the US aggressors.

    越外交部强烈谴责泰国决定派兵参与美国侵越战争 
    泰国充当美国侵越帮凶必将自食恶果
    新华社河内六日电　越南民主共和国外交部六日发表声明，强烈谴责泰国统治集团决定派遣海空部队帮助美帝国主义侵略越南。
    声明说，这是泰国他侬—巴博统治集团进一步参加美国侵略越南战争的新行动。
    声明指出，这一行动是在美国的命令下采取的，美国正在要求它的仆从拿出军队来加紧和扩大侵略越南和印度支那的战争。这一行动进一步暴露了他侬—巴博统治集团是美国的十分忠实的走狗。这个集团准备拿泰国青年的鲜血来换取美元以自肥。它完全背叛了泰国人民的利益，出卖了他们的国家主权和安全，反对越南人民的抗美救国斗争，破坏印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    声明说，越南民主共和国政府要求美帝国主义及其走狗立即停止派遣泰国雇佣军到越南南方去，从那里撤出美国和仆从的全部军队以及武器和其他战争物资。
    声明说，如果他侬—巴博统治集团蓄意要按照美国的命令行事，继续对越南人民采取敌对行动，它必须对一切后果负全部责任。
    据新华社河内六日电　越南《人民报》六日发表评论，严厉谴责泰国反动当局悍然决定派遣海空部队到南越去，为美帝国主义侵略越南战争效劳的罪恶行动。
    《人民报》的评论指出，这是泰国反动当局参加美国侵略越南战争的一个新的行动。
    评论说，不管泰国反动当局或者美国的其他走狗集团给予什么样的援助，都不能使美国摆脱在越南的失败。泰国反动当局顽固地追随美国，必将同美国侵略者一起遭到可耻的失败。
