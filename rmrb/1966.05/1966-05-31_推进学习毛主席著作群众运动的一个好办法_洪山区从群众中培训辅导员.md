    A Good Method for Promoting the Mass Movement of Studying Chairman Mao's Writings
    Hongshan District Trains Instructors from Among the Masses
    Learning activists are selected by the masses to participate in training classes; whoever learns well and applies well gives lectures, everyone learns, everyone lectures, teaching each other and learning from each other, bringing about a new upsurge in the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's writings throughout the district.
    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 30th) In the Socialist Education Movement, Hongshan District, Suixian County, Hubei Province, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," held training classes for instructors in studying Chairman Mao's writings, training more than 500 instructors for each production team, quickly pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings to a new high tide.

    Unleash the Masses and Run Instructor Training Classes Well

    The instructors trained this time were all selected by the masses. The criteria for selection were not based on how much one could read, but on who applied Chairman Mao's writings the best. Among them were cadres from the brigade and production team, returned youth students from poor and lower-middle peasant families, young people, and older people, some literate and some illiterate. They were all activists in the movement to give prominence to politics and study Chairman Mao's writings.

    In this instructor training class, everyone was a student, and everyone was also a teacher. Whoever learned well gave lectures, and whoever gave lectures was the teacher. Everyone learned, everyone lectured, teaching each other and learning from each other. There were no specially assigned teachers. The work team comrades leading the training class also went deep into each group, studying Chairman Mao's writings together with everyone, summarizing and exchanging learning experiences; at the same time, they grasped living thoughts, discovered typical examples, promoted typical examples, and inspired everyone to learn and lecture.

    Studying and Applying with Strong Class Feelings

    A distinct characteristic of these instructors in studying Chairman Mao's writings is that they study with strong class feelings, actively apply what they learn, learn a sentence, remember a sentence, and apply a sentence, making great efforts in the word "apply." They always study in connection with their own experiences, daring to reveal their own thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform themselves and arm themselves. Their lectures also focus on how they learn and how they apply, making them lively, concrete, and powerful, easily moving the masses' thoughts and driving the masses to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's writings. Liu Chaoyou, a poor peasant commune member from Qingxiang Brigade, Shuanghe Commune, recalled and compared the past with the present, remembering bitterness and thinking about sweetness, and spoke of his profound understanding of studying Chairman Mao's writings. He begged for food in the old society. Although he is now illiterate, he has a strong class feeling for studying Chairman Mao's writings. When others read him a sentence, he remembers a sentence, and applies a sentence. He has become a good example of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings. On March 15th of this year, an accident occurred with the team's 12-horsepower diesel engine used for milling rice. The engine's exhaust pipe shot out flames more than two feet high, filling the room with thick smoke. If the machine exploded, the engine room would be destroyed, and more than 20,000 jin of reserve grain, more than 5,000 jin of bean seeds, and a newly purchased 618-type power machine in the adjacent warehouse would be lost. He ran to the machine without hesitation and pressed down on the machine with all his strength. A piece of flesh was rubbed off his hand, and blood flowed, but he resolutely rescued the machine and finally won the victory. He said, "Chairman Mao is our great benefactor and great savior. In my whole life, I will wholeheartedly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely do as Chairman Mao says." After hearing this, many people said that they wanted to study Chairman Mao's writings with strong class feelings like Liu Chaoyou, so that they could learn well and apply well. Ma Mingfang, a non-detached health worker from Xingfu Brigade, Xinyang Commune, first revealed her thoughts in her speech and conducted self-criticism by comparing herself with Chairman Mao's writings. Before studying Chairman Mao's writings, she only thought of herself, not of the patients, and was afraid of trouble. If patients came to her door, she would treat them if she was happy, and not treat them if she was unhappy. Later, she studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and realized that Chairman Mao's books are the magic weapons for poor and lower-middle peasants to make revolution, and that she is the daughter of an old poor peasant and should study even harder. She paid attention to linking thought with reality in her studies, learning a little and applying a little. Her ideological awareness gradually improved, and she was determined to serve the poor and lower-middle peasants well. Wherever there were patients, she went to see them. In order to learn acupuncture, she first practiced on herself. When others asked her if it hurt, she said, "It doesn't matter if I hurt a little more. If I find the right acupoints, the poor and lower-middle peasants won't hurt when they are needled." Everyone was very moved by her speech and said, "This is the spirit of Norman Bethune."

    The training class seized and promoted these two examples of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, which further stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's writings and becoming good instructors. Everyone studied Chairman Mao's writings as if they were parched for water. Some were still studying diligently under the lamp late at night; some were still silently reciting Chairman Mao's writings in bed; some were still insisting on studying despite being ill.

    Grasp a Few Fundamental Viewpoints, Study Repeatedly, Apply Repeatedly

    At the beginning of the trial lectures in the training class, some people had ideological concerns: they thought that they had no culture and could not lecture; they were afraid that others would laugh if they did not lecture well. In order to solve these living ideological problems, the training class used living examples from the masses to educate the masses and dispel ideological concerns. At that time, several activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings were selected to give lectures at the district-wide instructor conference. When they lectured on "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," they generally first selected a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations in the article, read it to everyone twice, and then talked about the main points of Chairman Mao's writings. For example, when talking about "Serve the People," they prominently talked about five viewpoints: 1. Work thoroughly for the interests of the people; 2. The question of the view of life and death; 3. Correctly treat criticism; 4. Correctly treat difficulties; 5. Comrades should care for each other, love each other, and help each other. When talking about "In Memory of Norman Bethune," they prominently talked about eight characters: utter devotion to others without any thought of self; two extremes: extreme responsibility for work, extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people; five kinds of people: a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has broken away from vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people. When talking about "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," they prominently talked about determination, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory. Then, they used Chairman Mao's writings to compare their own thoughts and conduct self-criticism, and then linked them with the good people and good deeds that emerged in the team's study of Chairman Mao's writings, explaining the great significance of reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They spoke deeply and clearly, lively and vividly, and were easy to understand, which made the people in the audience applaud. In the face of living examples, everyone dispelled their concerns about not daring to speak and being afraid of not speaking well, and a new situation of everyone studying hard and rushing to lecture quickly emerged.

    Before the trial lectures, these instructors held Zhuge Liang meetings, carefully discussed lesson preparation, learned from each other's strengths, compensated for each other's weaknesses, taught each other, and constantly improved the quality of lectures. Everyone agreed that being a good instructor should pay attention to the following things: 1. Set an example by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings and set a good example for everyone; 2. When lecturing on Chairman Mao's writings, the center should be prominent and the main points should be grasped; 3. Conduct in-depth investigation and research, and pay attention to grasping living thoughts; 4. Put yourself in it, reveal your thoughts, compare yourself with Chairman Mao's writings, and dare to conduct self-criticism; 5. Vigorously praise good people and good deeds, and use good people and good deeds to vividly and concretely illustrate the viewpoints of Chairman Mao's writings, and help everyone truly understand the spirit of Chairman Mao's writings, study Chairman Mao's writings well, and improve ideological awareness. More and More People Participate in Learning, and Good People and Good Deeds Emerge in Large Numbers

    During the training of instructors, the inside and outside of the meeting were closely combined, helping each other, promoting each other, and encouraging each other. Many production team instructors in Zhuji, Songjia, Baoji and other communes, which were relatively close to the training class, studied in the training class during the day and rushed back to the team to give trial lectures at night, and their enthusiasm was very high. The commune members in the team also worked harder to study, and learned and applied at the same time, resulting in many good people and good deeds. Many teams wrote these good people and good deeds into small-character posters and big-character posters and sent them to the training class, which greatly promoted and encouraged everyone. Everyone regarded serving as an instructor in studying Chairman Mao's writings as the most important work and the most glorious task. Many production teams automatically sent newly emerging learning activists to the training class to study. More and more instructors participated in the training class, and there were more than 1,000 people listening to lectures at the conference.

    At present, each brigade has chief and deputy chief instructors, and each production team has an instructor group. A guidance network for studying Chairman Mao's writings has been formed in the entire district. Everyone is actively carrying out specific guidance, and solidifying and implementing one-helps-one, one-pairs-red, one-family-red, one-bay-red, and one-area-red learning activities, so that the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in the entire district has ushered in a new climax.

    推进学习毛主席著作群众运动的一个好办法
    洪山区从群众中培训辅导员
    由群众推选学习积极分子参加训练班；谁学得好、用得好就由谁讲课，人人学，人人讲，互教互学，使全区学习毛主席著作群众运动出现了新高潮。
    本报武汉三十日电　湖北省随县洪山区在社会主义教育运动中，遵照毛主席关于从群众中来到群众中去的教导，举办学习毛主席著作辅导员训练班，为各生产队共培养训练了五百多名辅导员，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动很快地推向了新的高潮。
    放手发动群众，办好辅导员训练班
    这次培训的辅导员都是群众推选的。推选的标准不是以谁识字多少，而是看谁把毛主席著作活学活用得最好。他们当中有大队和生产队的干部，有贫农下中农家庭出身的回乡青年学生，有青年人，也有老年人，有识字的，也有不识字的。他们都是在突出政治，学习毛主席著作运动中的积极分子。
    这次辅导员训练班，人人是学生，人人也是先生，谁学得好谁讲，谁讲谁就是老师，人人学，人人讲，互教互学，没有专配老师。领导办训练班的工作队同志，也都深入各个小组，跟大家一起学习毛主席著作，一起总结和交流学习经验；同时抓活思想，发现典型，推广典型，启发诱导大家学、大家讲。
    怀着强烈的阶级感情活学活用
    这些辅导员在学习毛主席著作中的一个鲜明特点，就是怀着强烈的阶级感情学，活学活用，学一句，记一句，用一句，在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们总是联系到自己的经历学习，勇于把自己的思想亮出来，用毛泽东思想来改造自己，武装自己。他们讲课也是讲自己怎么学怎么用的，讲起来生动、具体、有力，很容易打动群众的思想，带动群众活学活用毛主席著作。双河公社清香大队贫农社员刘朝友，在发言中回忆对比、忆苦思甜，讲了学习毛主席著作的深刻体会。他在旧社会讨过饭，现在虽不识字，可是对学习毛主席著作有强烈的阶级感情，别人给他念一句，他就记一句，记一句就用一句，成为活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样。今年三月十五日，队里打米用的十二马力的柴油机发生了事故，机子的排气管冒起了两尺多高的火苗，满屋浓烟，如果机器一爆炸，机房就会烧毁，隔壁仓库里的两万多斤储备粮、五千多斤豆种和一台新买的六一八型的动力机就保不住。他毫不犹豫地跑到机器旁边，用尽了全身的力气按住机器，手上擦掉了一块肉，鲜血直流，还是坚决抢救，终于取得了胜利。他说：“毛主席是我们的大恩人、大救星，我这一辈子，都要一心一意地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说我就坚决照着办。”许多人听了以后，都说要象刘朝友这样怀着强烈的阶级感情学习毛主席的著作，才能学得好，用得好。新阳公社幸福大队不脱产的卫生员马明芳，在发言中首先亮思想，跟毛主席的著作对照，进行自我批评。她没有学习毛主席的著作以前，光替自己想，不替病人想，怕麻烦，病人找上门来，高兴就给人家治，不高兴就不治。后来她学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，认识到毛主席的书是贫下中农干革命的法宝，自己是老贫农的女儿，应当更加好好地学习。她在学习中注意联系思想，联系实际，学一点，用一点，思想觉悟逐步提高，决心好好地为贫下中农服务，哪里有病人，就到哪里看。为了学会针灸，她首先在自己身上学着扎。别人问她疼不疼？她说：“我多疼一点不要紧，找准了穴位，贫下中农扎针时就可以不疼。”大家听了她的发言，很受感动，纷纷说：“这就是白求恩精神。”
    训练班抓住和推广了这两个活学活用毛主席著作的榜样，就更加激发了大家学习毛主席著作的热情和当好辅导员的积极性。大家如饥如渴的学习毛主席著作。有些人深夜还在灯下刻苦学习；有些人睡在床上还在默读毛主席的著作；有些人带病还在坚持学习。
    抓住几个根本观点，反复学，反复用
    在训练班上开始试讲时，有些人有思想顾虑：认为自己没有文化，不能讲；怕讲得不好别人笑。为了解决这些活的思想问题，训练班运用群众中的活榜样去教育群众，解除思想顾虑。当时挑选了几位学习毛主席著作的积极分子，让他们在全区辅导员大会上讲课。他们在讲《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》时，一般都是先从文章中选一段毛主席的语录，给大家念两遍，再讲毛主席著作的要点。如讲《为人民服务》时，就突出的讲五个观点：一、彻底地为人民的利益工作；二、生死观问题；三、正确对待批评；四、正确对待困难；五、同志之间要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。在讲《纪念白求恩》时，就突出的讲八个字：毫不利己，专门利人；两个极端：对工作极端的负责任，对同志对人民极端的热忱；五种人：一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。在讲《愚公移山》时，就突出地讲下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。接着，用毛主席的著作来对照自己的思想，进行自我批评，然后再联系本队在学习毛主席著作中出现的好人好事，说明读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的重大意义。他们讲得深刻明确，生动活泼，通俗易懂，使会场上听的人连声称好。在活生生的榜样面前，大家都打消了不敢讲和怕讲不好的顾虑，很快就出现了一个人人刻苦学习和争先恐后讲课的新局面。
    这些辅导员在试讲以前，召开诸葛亮会，认真商量备课，取长补短，互教互学，不断地提高讲课质量。大家一致认为当好辅导员要注意这样几件事情：一、以身作则，带头活学活用毛主席著作，给大家树立良好的榜样；二、讲毛主席著作时要中心突出，掌握要点；三、深入调查研究，注意抓活思想；四、把自己摆进去，把思想亮出来，用毛主席著作对照自己，勇于进行自我批评；五、大力表扬好人好事，通过好人好事生动具体地说明毛主席著作的观点，帮助大家真正领会毛主席著作的精神，学好毛主席的著作，提高思想觉悟。参加学习的人越来越多，好人好事大量出现
    在培训辅导员期间，会内会外紧密结合，互相帮助，互相促进，互相鼓舞。离训练班比较近的朱集、宋家、鲍集等公社很多生产队的辅导员，白天在训练班学习，晚上赶回队里试讲，情绪十分高涨。在队里的社员也加倍努力学习，并且边学边用，结果涌现了很多好人好事。不少队就把这些好人好事写成小字报、大字报，送到训练班，使大家受到了很大的促进和鼓舞。大家都把担任学习毛主席著作的辅导员，当作了最重要的工作和最光荣的任务。很多生产队把新涌现的学习积极分子，自动送到训练班里学习。参加训练班的辅导员越来越多，在大会听课的就有一千多人。
    目前，各大队都有正副总辅导员，各生产队都有辅导小组，已在全区形成了一个学习毛主席著作辅导网，大家正在积极进行具体辅导，扎扎实实地开展一帮一、一对红、一家红、一湾红、一片红的学习活动，使全区活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了一个新的高潮。
