    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 22nd dispatch) The puppet Nguyen Cao Ky-Nguyen Van Thieu group and the Nguyen Chanh Thi group continue their infighting in Da Nang. The United States is constantly applying pressure, but still cannot get the two factions of lackeys to "reconcile." Demonstrations by Buddhists against the US-puppet group have broken out in Saigon, further escalating the tense situation.

    According to Western news agencies, after returning to Saigon on the evening of the 20th, the US "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Lodge, immediately intervened in the South Vietnamese situation. On the 21st, Lodge sent an "urgent cable" to both sides, saying that the current crisis has had "an adverse impact" on the United States and that both sides should "resolve this fierce conflict as soon as possible," otherwise it "may undermine continued US support for South Vietnam." On the 22nd, Lodge held talks with Nguyen Cao Ky to discuss the current "explosive political situation." American officials are also running around, "seeking" so-called "compromise solutions." Despite this, the two factions remain deadlocked. On the 21st, Nguyen Chanh Thi rejected the American proposal for him to go to Saigon to meet with Nguyen Cao Ky, and insisted that Nguyen Cao Ky step down. On the 21st, Nguyen Cao Ky dispatched two more battalions of reinforcements to Da Nang to continue attacking Nguyen Chanh Thi's troops.

    According to reports, the two sides' troops have been engaged in fierce fighting for the past two days, with hundreds of casualties. On the 21st, artillery shells fired by Nguyen Chanh Thi's troops landed within the headquarters of the US Marine Corps and another US military facility. When Nguyen Cao Ky's air force attacked Nguyen Chanh Thi's troops, they also dropped a bomb and six rockets on the US Marine Corps' positions, wounding a total of fifteen US soldiers. This situation has made their American masters both angry and anxious.

    According to reports, although Nguyen Cao Ky has mobilized heavy troops to guard Saigon, the situation in Saigon is also very tense. On the 21st and 22nd, tens of thousands of Buddhists held demonstrations in Saigon against the Nguyen Cao Ky group, chanting "Yankees go home!" The Nguyen Cao Ky group dispatched armed police to suppress the demonstrations, throwing tear gas at the demonstrators.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd dispatch) The infighting among the South Vietnamese puppet groups has caused increasing anxiety in Washington.

    US President Johnson, in a brief press conference held at the White House on the 21st, stated that this is "a serious problem." He said that the US government is "watching the development of the situation in South Vietnam very closely."

    He was worried that the puppet infighting would affect the American war of aggression against Vietnam, and therefore expressed: He "regretted" any action that "deviates from defeating the communists." He demanded that "every effort be made to make all factions understand that unity is necessary."

    However, he helplessly admitted that "this is a difficult and arduous task." The South Vietnamese puppets "face no problems that have easy answers, no ready-made solutions."

    The night before Johnson issued this statement, he held a high-level meeting with US Vice President Humphrey, Secretary of State Rusk, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and others to discuss the South Vietnamese situation.

    傀儡火并愈演愈烈　美国主子又气又急
    华盛顿惊呼南越出现爆炸性政治局势
    约翰逊承认困难重重美国对局势束手无策
    据新华社二十二日讯　西贡消息：南越傀儡阮高其—阮文绍集团同阮正诗集团在岘港继续火并，美国不断施加压力，仍无法使两派走狗“和解”。西贡又爆发了佛教徒反对美伪集团的示威，局势更加紧张。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国驻南越“大使”洛奇二十日晚上返回西贡后，立即插手干涉南越局势。二十一日，洛奇向双方发出了“急电”，说目前的危机已经对美国“产生了不利的影响”，要双方“从速解决这场激烈的冲突”，否则“可能损害美国对南越继续提供支持”。二十二日，洛奇同阮高其举行了会谈，讨论当前“爆炸性的政治局势”。美国的官员也四出奔走，“寻求”所谓“折衷解决办法”。尽管这样，这两派仍然相持不下。阮正诗在二十一日拒绝了美国人要他到西贡去同阮高其会谈的提议，并且坚持要阮高其下台。阮高其在二十一日又派遣两营援军到岘港，继续向阮正诗的军队进攻。
    据报道，这两天来，双方军队一直在激战，已死伤数百名。二十一日，阮正诗军队发射的炮弹落在美国海军陆战队总部和另外一处美军设施内，阮高其的空军在袭击阮正诗的军队时，也把一枚炸弹和六枚火箭投到了美国海军陆战队的阵地上，双方共打伤美军十五名。这种情况，使得他们的美国主子又气又急。
    据报道，尽管阮高其已调集重兵把守西贡，西贡的局势也十分紧张。二十一日和二十二日两天中，西贡共有上万名佛教徒举行了反对阮高其集团的示威，并且高呼“美国佬滚回去！”阮高其集团出动了武装警察进行镇压，向示威群众投掷催泪弹。
    据新华社二十二日讯　华盛顿消息：南越傀儡集团间的火并在华盛顿引起了越来越大的焦灼不安。
    美国总统约翰逊二十一日在白宫举行的临时记者招待会上发表声明说，这是“一个严重问题”。他说，美国政府“正在非常密切地注视着”南越局势的发展。
    他担心傀儡内讧扩大会影响美国的侵越战争，因而表示：他对“任何背离击败共产党人”的行动“感到遗憾”。他要求“尽一切努力使各派系了解团结是必要的”。
    但是，他无可奈何地承认，“这是一件艰巨和困难重重的工作”。南越傀儡们“面临的任何问题，都没有简易的答案、都没有现成的解决办法”。
    在约翰逊发表这一声明的头一天晚上，他同美国副总统汉弗莱、国务卿腊斯克、国防部长麦克纳马拉等人举行了一次高级会议，讨论了南越局势。
