　　Not an Inch of Cambodian Territory is Allowed to be Violated
　　By People's Daily Commentator

　　On April 30th, invading American troops bombarded the Cambodian border with fierce artillery fire. On May 3rd, American troops, using the pretext of "tracking Viet Cong forces," again shelled Cambodian territory. The frequent military provocations against the Kingdom of Cambodia by the American aggressors show that the Johnson administration is stepping up its aggressive moves to expand the war in Indochina.

　　The recent brutal invasion of Cambodia by U.S. imperialism has been carried out blatantly. In the past, it usually instigated the Saigon puppet clique to act as thugs; even when deploying some American troops, it always tried to cover it up and make all sorts of excuses afterwards. But now it is different. The American military spokesman in Saigon openly admitted that it was American troops who shelled Cambodian territory; and the American soldiers were acting on the orders of their commanders.

　　U.S. imperialism shamelessly says that the invading American troops have to invade Cambodia because they have some "right of pursuit." As the Cambodian National Radio pointed out, the so-called "Viet Cong elements" shelled by the American aggressors were Cambodian troops and militia defending the border of their own country. The Johnson administration's self-proclaimed "right of pursuit" means that it simply does not recognize the sovereignty of Cambodia as an independent nation in its mind. The arrogance and tyranny of U.S. imperialism has reached its extreme!

　　This barbaric attitude of U.S. imperialism is intolerable to any sovereign state. The resolute counterattack by the Cambodian army against the invaders is a serious warning to the American bandits. The Cambodian National Radio put it well: The Cambodian people will never yield an inch of their land to the invaders!

　　The ringleaders in Washington, you had better remember this bold statement of the Cambodian people. In Indochina today, whether in the upper or lower reaches of the Mekong River, whether on the right or left side of the Truong Son Range, wherever U.S. imperialism extends its claws, it will inevitably be severely punished!

    柬埔寨的每一寸领土都不容侵犯
    本报评论员
    四月三十日，侵越美军以猛烈炮火轰击柬埔寨边境。五月三日，美国军队又借口“追踪越共军队”，炮击柬埔寨领土。美国侵略者如此频繁地对柬埔寨王国进行军事挑衅，表明约翰逊政府正在加紧推行扩大印度支那战火的侵略步骤。
    美帝国主义最近对柬埔寨的粗暴侵犯，是明目张胆地干的。过去，它通常是唆使西贡傀儡集团充当打手；即使出动部分美国军队，也总是尽量掩饰，事后百般狡赖。而现在却不同了。西贡的美国军事发言人公开供认，炮轰柬埔寨领土的，是美国军队；美国大兵又是奉指挥官的命令行事的。
    美帝国主义大言不惭地说，侵越美军所以要侵犯柬埔寨，是因为它们有什么“追踪权”。正如柬埔寨国家电台所指出的，美国侵略者炮击的所谓“越共分子”，是保卫自己祖国边境的柬埔寨军队和民兵。约翰逊政府自封有什么“追踪权”，在它的心目中也就根本不承认柬埔寨这个独立国家的主权。美帝国主义的骄横和霸道，真是到了极点！
    美帝国主义的这种蛮横态度，是任何一个主权国家所难以容忍的。柬埔寨军队给予侵略者的坚决反击，是对美国强盗的严正警告。柬埔寨国家电台说得好：柬埔寨人民决不向侵略者让出一寸国土！
    华盛顿的头目们，你们最好能记住柬埔寨人民的这一豪言壮语。在今天的印度支那，不论在湄公河的上游或下游，不论在长山山脉的右侧或左侧，美帝国主义把魔爪伸到那里，就必然要在那里受到严峻的惩罚！
