    A Few Words

    Powerful Refutation
    Recently, the US Ambassador to the United Nations, Goldberg, said: the United States will insist on making "peace proposals" to China, but "the United States hopes that China will abandon its policy of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun'."
    The "peace proposals" of the United States are ridiculous; and what it wants the Chinese people to abandon is the firm stand of the Chinese people to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, which is of course impossible. The Chinese people will never trade on principles. Doesn't the United States know this? However, Goldberg's words are a powerful refutation. It shows that the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" of the revolutionary people is indeed what US imperialism fears most, and what the people of all countries must never give up.
    Guilty Conscience
    A reporter asked US Secretary of State Rusk to talk about whether it was "reasonable for the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky to move his troops into Da Nang." The Secretary of State replied, "I don't want to make a judgment on this," and hurriedly said, "You know, this is not a joint operation, there is no US, no US troops involved."
    Leaving aside the fact that Rusk's answer is so off-topic, what is strange is that he made a "burying the silver here" statement so impatiently about a question that no one had asked. There is only one explanation for this: a guilty conscience.

    三言两语
    有力的反证
    美国驻联合国大使戈德堡最近说：美国将坚持向中国提出“和平建议”，但是“美国希望中国会放弃它的‘枪杆子里面出政权’的政策”。
    美国的“和平建议”是可笑的；而它要中国人民放弃的，是中国人民支持各国人民革命斗争的坚定立场，这当然是办不到的。中国人民决不会拿原则作交易，美国难道还不知道吗？不过，戈德堡的话倒是一个有力的反证，它说明：革命人民的“枪杆子里面出政权”这个真理，的确是美帝国主义所最害怕的，也是各国人民所万万不能放弃的。
    做贼心虚
    有记者要美国国务卿腊斯克谈谈南越傀儡阮高其“把他的军队调进岘港是不是有道理”。这位国务卿回答：“我不希望对此下判决”，并且急忙说：“你们知道，这并不是一个联合行动，并没有美国，并没有美国军队参加。”
    腊斯克的答复这样离题暂且不说，奇特的是，他对一个并没有人提出的问题，竟然这样迫不及待地做一番“此地无银三百两”的表白。这只有一个解释：做贼心虚。
