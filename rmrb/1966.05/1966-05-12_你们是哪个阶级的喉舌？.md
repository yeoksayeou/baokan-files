    Which Class's Mouthpiece Are You?
    Qin Dianjie
    I recently compared the article "Deng Tuo's 'Yanshan Evening Talks' is Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Talk," published in the newspaper, with the critical materials regarding "Three-Family Village" and "Yanshan Evening Talks" published by the *Beijing Daily* on April 16th. The more I read, the angrier I became. It can be clearly seen from the materials published by the *Beijing Daily* that the editorial department of *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* did not thoroughly expose and mercilessly criticize Deng Tuo, the "chief culprit" of such an anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. Instead, they deliberately and cautiously tapped on the fake wall, attempting to divert people's attention and shield this "chief culprit" of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line to help him sneak through. They were trying to "turn a major evil into a minor mistake" and transform a major anti-Party and anti-socialist political issue into a matter of ideological awareness and pure academic inquiry. We must ask *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily*: Which side are you sitting on? Where are you still the Party's and the proletariat's mouthpiece?
    At first glance, the editor's notes in *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* seem to have a revolutionary tone. They also express admission of mistakes, acceptance of lessons, and participation in this struggle! But these are just empty facades, lacking genuine substance. Since 1961, readers' letters criticizing "Yanshan Evening Talks" have been constantly increasing, but you did not publish them. This time, you only selected one reader's letter from 1964. What's the reason for this? In fact, after "Yanshan Evening Talks" was published, many readers wrote letters to criticize it, but you rejected them all. I had a personal experience. In early 1962, the *Beijing Evening News* published an article titled "Advocating Dog Breeding." I sensed the bourgeois scent of this article. At that time, I did not know who "Ma Nancun" was, so I wrote a poem, the general idea of which was to criticize Ma Nancun for deviating from the revolutionary spirit and playing with bourgeois tea-time trivialities, leading people in what direction. This critical draft was given to a responsible comrade by Comrade Shen in the newspaper office, who returned it to me on the same day after reviewing it. Comrade Shen told me: "Our responsible comrade said that this was written by Comrade Deng Tuo, so your poem is being returned to you!" At that time, I only thought that the newspaper's leaders were simply worshiping celebrities and blindly believing in authority. Now I know that they were standing on the same line with anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.

    你们是哪个阶级的喉舌？
    秦殿杰
    我把最近报纸发表的《邓拓的〈燕山夜话〉是反党反社会主义的黑话》，同《北京日报》四月十六日发表的关于“三家村”和《燕山夜话》的批判材料，作了一个对照和比较，愈读愈感到气愤。从《北京日报》发表的材料中可以明显看出，对于邓拓这样一个反党反社会主义黑线的“首脑”，《前线》《北京日报》编辑部不是把他揪出来给以彻底的揭露和无情的批判，而是居心叵测地在假墙外面轻描淡写地敲打敲打，妄图转移人们的视线，掩护这个反党反社会主义黑线的“首脑”混过关去，“化大恶为小错”，把反党反社会主义的重大政治问题化为思想意识和纯学术性问题。我们要问一问《前线》《北京日报》，你们的屁股坐到哪一边去了？你们哪里还是党的无产阶级的喉舌？
    乍看上去，《前线》《北京日报》编者按语调子也是革命的呀，也表示承认错误，接受教训，投入这场斗争呀！但这只是空洞的幌子，没有真实货色。一九六一年以来读者对《燕山夜话》的批评信件不断递增，你们不予发表，而这次仅选发了一封一九六四年的读者来信，这是什么道理呢？事实上，《燕山夜话》刊出后，不少读者去信提出批评，但都被你们一棒打回去了。我就有过一次亲身经历。一九六二年初，《北京晚报》上发表了《提倡养狗》一文，我嗅到了这篇文章的资产阶级气味，当时不知道“马南邨”系何许人，便写了一首诗，大意是批评马南邨背离革命精神，玩的是资产阶级茶余酒后的一套玩艺，要把人们引到什么方向去。这件批评稿经报社办公室沈同志转给了一位负责同志看了，当天就退给了我。沈同志告我：“我们的负责同志说这是邓拓同志写的，你的诗退给你！”当时我还只是认为报社领导人是一味崇拜名人，迷信权威。现在才知道，原来他们同反党反社会主义分子站在一条线上。
