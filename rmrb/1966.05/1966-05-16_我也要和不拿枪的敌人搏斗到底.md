    I will also fight the enemies who do not carry guns to the end!
    Deng Tuo is a thoroughly hidden enemy wearing a revolutionary cloak. We must strip off his disguise completely and uproot him.
    Kunming City Near Park Department Store Communist Youth League General Branch Secretary Xu Xuehui
    Deng Tuo used all kinds of vicious language to attack our beloved Party. I was extremely angry after reading Deng Tuo's black talk. I cannot tolerate this small handful of anti-Party elements arbitrarily slandering our beloved Party!
    Our Party is the savior of the people of the whole country and the lighthouse of revolutionary people all over the world. Without the Party, there would be no revolution, there would be nothing. In March 1959, I fought with bandits who crossed the border and paid the price of my hands. At that time, what I thought about was completing the task assigned to me by the Party and protecting the property of the people's revolution. I defeated the bandits and protected the property of the people's revolution, and thus safeguarded the interests of the Party and the revolution. Today, Deng Tuo dares to viciously scold and fire poisonous arrows at the Party and the cause of the revolution that we have maintained at the cost of blood and sacrifice. How can we tolerate this! Deng Tuo's vicious curses completely exposed his extreme hatred for the Party and the countless revolutionary comrades who shed blood and sacrificed themselves. He is a thoroughly hidden enemy wearing a revolutionary cloak. We must strip off his disguise completely and drag out each and every member of his gang. I am a girl from a poor family. I just did what I should do. After I was injured, the Party gave me meticulous care and encouragement. The Party is the protector of the revolutionary interests of the people. Isn't such a Party the most glorious, the greatest, the most consistent in word and deed, the most trustworthy, and the most worthy of love! Deng Tuo cursed our beloved Party for suffering from "amnesia" and being "self-contradictory and untrustworthy." Isn't this the most shameless and thorough slander? Deng Tuo slandered our Party as saying "grand empty words" and "clichés." This is viciously opposing Mao Zedong Thought and opposing our listening to the Party. We revolutionary people have incomparably deep class feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. The more we listen to the Party's words, the more we love to listen, and the more energetic we become. It was after listening to the Party's words that I understood how to safeguard the Party's and the revolution's interests and bravely fought with the bandits; it was after listening to the Party's words that I was able to overcome the numerous difficulties of losing my hands with tenacious perseverance. We cannot tolerate Deng Tuo's vicious slander of Mao Zedong Thought. We must better use the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to expose the conspiracies of all demons and monsters and repel their frenzied attacks. I want to solemnly tell Deng Tuo that I grew up under the education and care of the Party. The Party gave me a second life. For the interests of the Party and the people, I fought with enemies carrying guns; today, I will fight to the end with you enemies who do not carry guns. In the past, I did not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice to safeguard the interests of the Party and the revolution; in the future, I will also not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice to repel all frenzied anti-Party and anti-socialist attacks. Your anti-Party conspiracy will never be realized.

    我也要和不拿枪的敌人搏斗到底
    邓拓是一个道道地地的披着革命外衣的暗藏的敌人，我们必须把他的伪装扯得精光，把他连根拔掉
    昆明市近日公园百货商店团总支书记　徐学惠
    邓拓用尽恶毒的语言攻击我们亲爱的党，我看了邓拓的那些黑话，气愤极了。我不能容许这一小撮反党分子任意污蔑我们亲爱的党！
    我们的党是全国人民的救星，全世界革命人民的灯塔，没有党，就没有革命，就没有一切。一九五九年三月，我和越境的匪徒搏斗，付出了我的双手。当时，我想到的是完成党交给我的任务和保卫人民革命的财产，我战胜了匪徒和保住了人民革命财产，也就维护了党和革命的利益。今天，邓拓对于我们不惜流血牺牲来维护的党以及革命的事业，竟敢这样的大骂黑话，大放毒箭，我们怎么能够容忍！邓拓的恶毒咒骂，完完全全地暴露出他对党对流血牺牲的无数革命同志是极端仇视的，他是道道地地的披着革命外衣的暗藏敌人，我们必须把他的伪装扯得精光，把他的一伙一个一个地揪出来。我是一个贫苦人家的女孩子，我不过做了我应该做的事情。在我负伤后，党给了我无微不至的关怀和鼓励。党是人民革命利益的保卫者。这样的党，不是最光荣、最伟大、最言行一致、最堪信任、最应该热爱的吗！邓拓咒骂我们亲爱的党害了“健忘症”、“自食其言，不堪信任”，这难道不是最无耻最彻头彻尾的污蔑吗？邓拓污蔑我们的党是说“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”，这是恶毒地反对毛泽东思想，是反对我们听党的话。我们革命人民对毛泽东思想是怀着无比深厚的阶级感情的，我们对党的话越听越爱听，越听浑身越有劲。我是听了党的话，才懂得维护党的和革命的利益，勇敢地和匪徒搏斗着；我是听了党的话，才能用顽强的毅力，克服了失去双手的重重困难。我们不能容忍邓拓对毛泽东思想的恶毒污蔑。我们要更好地用毛泽东思想的武器，来揭穿一切牛鬼蛇神的阴谋活动和打退他们的猖狂进攻。我要正告邓拓，我是在党的教育关怀下成长的。党给了我第二次的生命。为了党和人民的利益，我和拿枪的敌人搏斗过；今天，我和你们这些不拿枪的敌人同样要搏斗到底。过去，我不惜流血牺牲维护党的和革命的利益；今后，我同样不惜流血牺牲来打退一切反党反社会主义的猖狂进攻。你们的反党阴谋，永远不能实现。
