    Sholokhov's Traitorous True Colors
    Cai Hui
    The laws of history are exceptionally severe. In the critical moment of struggle, they relentlessly force opportunists and traitors of all stripes to tear off their masks and expose their true colors. Sholokhov is such an example. In October 1965, this Sholokhov, who styles himself a "Communist Party member" and "proletarian writer," was flattered to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, an honor that even the French bourgeois writer Sartre refused to accept—in Sartre's words, accepting "a kind of honor reserved for Western writers and Eastern traitors."¹
    Ever since the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Nobel Prize awarding institution has been doing everything possible to search for "Eastern traitors" among Russian writers. Despite their high-sounding declarations of valuing "literary talent," they fundamentally refuse to acknowledge Gorky's literary genius, praised by Lenin. What they do acknowledge and strive to find and greatly reward are the "geniuses" among Russian writers who are resolutely anti-communist and resolutely opposed to the October Socialist Revolution.
    In 1933, sixteen years after the success of the October Revolution, the prize awarding institution bestowed the prize upon a Russian writer for the first time. This writer was not Gorky, nor any other literary worker who supported the socialist revolution, but Ivan Bunin, an "émigré writer" who extremely hated the October Revolution and fled to Paris.
    In 1958, they, again with the same political aim, awarded the prize to another notorious traitor: Boris Pasternak, the author of the anti-communist novel *Doctor Zhivago*. The international reactionaries thereby ignited a wave of anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment. The Western bourgeois press greatly admired the role played by the Nobel Prize in Literature. *Die Presse*, a newspaper published in Vienna, even bluntly called it the "Nobel Prize against Communism." At that time, the broad masses of Soviet people angrily condemned the Nobel Prize in Literature as a "Western tool" and unanimously denounced Pasternak's traitorous actions. Even the Soviet *Pravda* of October 26 of that year had to say: "The reactionary bourgeoisie rewards with the Nobel Prize" "slanderers who slander the socialist revolution and the Soviet people." Even Sholokhov grudgingly made a gesture of condemning Pasternak as a "White Russian at home."
    Ironically, in a short period of time, Sholokhov gratefully accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, which he had once condemned as being awarded to "White Russians at home." Of course, Sholokhov's "talent" was not so great that he would be stupid enough to openly admit that what he accepted was a reward for a traitor. Thus, he and the small handful of modern revisionist writers he represented tried every possible means to convince the broad masses of the Soviet people that the Nobel Prize in Literature had changed its nature and had become exceptionally "objective and impartial." A person in charge of the Soviet Writers' Union even shamelessly told a reporter from the United Press International that it was "a great commendation of socialist literature." The CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers also personally stepped forward, saying that this was "another proof that the indisputable achievements of socialist realism literature have won world recognition."²
    Enough! Admirable magicians, despite your outstanding lying abilities, your extreme excitement at Sholokhov's award has caused you to "overlook" an important fact: Esterling, the chairman of the Nobel Prize Committee of the Swedish Academy, had long ago publicly explained the reason for the award—it was not that they had changed their position, but because: "Although Mr. Sholokhov is a devout Communist Party member, he does not talk about ideological issues at all in his four-volume magnum opus (i.e., *And Quiet Flows the Don*—translator)."³
    Leaders of the CPSU Central Committee and ministers of the Soviet Council of Ministers, critics of all sizes in the Soviet Union, haven't you insisted that awarding Sholokhov the Nobel Prize in Literature is an "acknowledgment" of "socialist realism literature," is "a great commendation of socialist literature"? It turns out that the "socialist literature" that you flaunt is just this kind of so-called "supraclass" literature without ideological tendencies, advocated by the bourgeoisie! You keep boasting that you follow Lenin's principles, but you have forgotten Lenin's slogan of "Down with non-Party writers! Down with superhuman writers!" Isn't this the biggest irony?
    In fact, so-called literature that "does not talk about ideological issues at all," "supraclass" literature, simply does not exist. It is just a literary slogan used by the bourgeoisie and revisionists to fool readers, deceive readers, and cover up their vile purpose of serving imperialism and the bourgeoisie. In today's world, all literature and art belong to a certain class, belong to a certain political line, and therefore, must necessarily promote certain ideological consciousness and have certain political tendencies. The so-called literature that does not involve ideological consciousness flaunted by the bourgeoisie and revisionists is actually trying every possible means to spread the bourgeoisie's reactionary ideological consciousness and has a reactionary political tendency.
    Sholokhov's *And Quiet Flows the Don* is just such a "magnum opus." As long as we use the Marxist class viewpoint to analyze this novel, it is not difficult to discover that one of the important reasons why Sholokhov can be "recorded in the list of Nobel Prize in Literature winners" together with Pasternak is precisely because his "four-volume magnum opus" and Pasternak's *Doctor Zhivago* are truly similar in their approach. If in *Doctor Zhivago*, Pasternak maliciously depicted a picture of the "destruction" of Russian intellectuals in the new society and made various slanders against the Soviet Red Army and the new life after the October Revolution through Zhivago, an old Russian bourgeois intellectual who hated the October Revolution and hated the socialist system; then in *And Quiet Flows the Don*, Sholokhov simply attacked the "inhumanity" of the October Socialist Revolution and class struggle by glorifying Grigory, a counter-revolutionary element with blood debts who fought madly against the Red Army: it not only destroyed Grigory's "beautiful soul," making Grigory lose everything "connected with the world," but also destroyed the peaceful, happy, and tranquil life of the Melekhov family, thereby issuing an undisguised curse against the revolutionary war.
    At the recently opened 23rd Congress of the CPSU, Sholokhov accused some Soviet writers of being "traitors" and said: "There is nothing more blasphemous and abominable than slandering one's own mother, basely insulting her, and laying hands on her!" In fact, aren't these words applicable to Sholokhov himself? As early as more than twenty years ago, he had already used his *And Quiet Flows the Don* to slander the road of the October Revolution and had already laid hands on his "mother." What he struck was Lenin, Stalin, and the great October Socialist Revolution!
    The American bourgeois press, with its unique class sensitivity, clearly saw the strong anti-communist consciousness of the novel *And Quiet Flows the Don* and therefore expressed great appreciation. When Sholokhov accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, *Saturday Review* excitedly wrote that "this Russian who won the prize" "represents precisely those Don Cossacks who attacked the Red Army." He "expressed a certain doubt about communist dogma and tactics through the characters in his novel."⁴ It is not difficult for people to see that the Western reactionary bourgeoisie has taken a fancy to Sholokhov precisely because of this important reason, and not because of any other reason.
    What is worthy of further consideration is that twenty years ago (1946), Sholokhov was also nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Why didn't the Western bourgeoisie select him at that time, and only "discover" his "genius" nineteen years later (1965)? What is the mystery here?
    Once revealed, the reason is also very simple. Before the Khrushchev revisionists usurped the leadership of the Soviet Union, Sholokhov, after all, did not yet have the courage to completely expose his true colors. Therefore, although the Western bourgeoisie greatly appreciated his *And Quiet Flows the Don*, they were still not very reassured about him and therefore adopted a "wait and see" attitude. At that time, although Sholokhov had already attacked the revolutionary war and the October Revolution in his novel, he still had to say some insincere words praising the October Revolution and praising Stalin on certain occasions. In the past, he, like Khrushchev, called Stalin his "father." Until Stalin's unfortunate death in 1953, Sholokhov still hypocritically sobbed: "Father, farewell! Farewell, dear father who has been loved all my life!" And he vowed to "forever keep the sacred mourning for Stalin in his heart."⁵
    However, in a short period of time, at the 20th Congress of the CPSU held in 1956, he openly threw himself into the arms of Khrushchev, who was madly against Stalin, and closely cooperated with Khrushchev, launching a large-scale attack on Fadeyev, one of the main leaders of the Soviet Party in literature during Stalin's leadership; he wrote his *Fate of a Man*, which can be called a model of modern revisionist literature, and became the leader in promoting revisionism in the Soviet literary and art circles for Khrushchev. From then on, as he vowed, no matter where Khrushchev flew, he and Khrushchev were always "together" "ideologically."⁶ Even more disgusting, at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, it was this Sholokhov who shamelessly announced that he had a "male" "feeling of love" for Khrushchev that was "unspeakable."
    Khrushchev and his successors, of course, also especially appreciated this loyal mouthpiece who played a special role. Because on his head, not only was he wearing the title of "Party member writer," but he was also a winner of the Stalin Prize and a representative of the Supreme Soviet of all sessions. This series of titles, at least for the moment, can still confuse a part of the Soviet people and people in the international cultural circles who do not know the truth, playing a deceptive role among them.
    Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world is the soul of the Khrushchev revisionist line. Therefore, Sholokhov has been vigorously peddling the stuff of Soviet-U.S. cultural fusion among Soviet readers and the international cultural circles, becoming a pioneer in promoting Soviet-U.S. cultural fusion. On the one hand, he vigorously promotes bourgeois ideological consciousness, bourgeois theories of human nature, and bourgeois freedom, equality, and fraternity in the Soviet Union, instilling reactionary ideas of bourgeois individualism, humanitarianism, and pacifism to the broad masses of Soviet readers; on the other hand, he has also changed his past "snail-like" lifestyle and traveled abroad again and again, everywhere advocating that writers of oppressed nations and oppressed classes and writers of imperialism and the bourgeoisie take "joint action" and "collectively express opinions."⁷ Therefore, he begged the U.S. imperialism: "Let us visit each other! We have nothing to argue and fight about."⁸ Therefore, at the European Writers' Conference, he shouted at the top of his voice that writers should, like the "great politicians and diplomats" of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Britain, "reach an agreement" and "find a common language."⁹
    What is the purpose? The purpose is to safeguard the interests of the ruling groups of the Soviet Union and the U.S., and not allow others to make revolution. Sholokhov opposes all wars indiscriminately, whether it is a revolutionary war launched by oppressed people or a war of liberation carried out by an invaded nation, he wants writers all over the world to "first" come out and say: "No!" "And say it before those who say 'yes'."¹⁰ In short, he himself betrayed the revolution, and he does not allow others to make revolution! Not only does he not allow others to make revolution, but he also attempts to have all the writers in the world "unite" and "collectively" not allow others to make revolution!
    It is precisely because of this that Sholokhov is not only favored by Khrushchev and his successors, but also rewarded by the Western reactionary bourgeoisie.
    Facts have proved that it is not the Nobel Prize in Literature, which is called a "Western tool" by the Soviet people, that has changed its nature, but Sholokhov has completely torn off his fig leaf and become a naked "Western tool." The reactionary bourgeoisie has finally found an "Eastern traitor" who is more useful than Pasternak.
    We can tell Sholokhov and the small handful of modern revisionist literary and art figures that Sholokhov represents: Don't be complacent, don't be smug! Since you have openly betrayed the proletarian revolutionary cause, you will inevitably be spurned by the Soviet people and all revolutionary people in the world. The wheels of history will ruthlessly crush all obstacles on the road forward. The revolutionary cause of the proletariat and the oppressed people of the world will inevitably surge across the world with the force of an avalanche and the power of thunder, forever maintaining its beautiful youth! And the proletarian revolutionary literature and art will also flourish in the battle, and will forever become a battle drum and horn that inspires people to rise up and fight!

    肖洛霍夫的叛徒真面目
    蔡辉
    历史的法则是异常严峻的，它在斗争的紧要关头，总是无情地迫使形形色色的机会主义者和叛徒们，撕下自己的面纱，暴露出真正的面目来。肖洛霍夫就是如此。一九六五年十月，这位号称为“共产党员”、“无产阶级作家”的肖洛霍夫，受宠若惊地接受了连法国的资产阶级作家萨特都不愿接受的诺贝尔文学奖金——用萨特的话说，就是接受了“一种保留给西方作家和东方叛徒的荣誉”①。
    自从伟大的十月社会主义革命取得胜利以来，诺贝尔文学奖金的颁发机构就一直在俄罗斯的作家中千方百计地搜罗“东方叛徒”了。尽管他们冠冕堂皇地宣称自己是如何如何地看重“文学才华”，但是，他们却根本不承认被列宁称赞过的高尔基的文学天才；他们所承认、并且努力寻求和大力奖赏的只是俄罗斯作家中的坚决反共、坚决反对十月社会主义革命的“天才”。
    一九三三年，也就是在十月革命成功之后的第十六年，这个奖金的颁发机构第一次把奖金授给了俄罗斯作家。这个作家不是高尔基，也不是其他拥护社会主义革命的文学工作者，而是极端仇恨十月革命、逃亡巴黎的“白俄作家”蒲宁。
    一九五八年，他们又本着同样的政治目的，把奖金授给了另一个臭名昭著的叛徒：反共小说《日瓦戈医生》的作者帕斯捷尔纳克，国际反动派并且由此掀起了一个反苏反共的浪潮。西方资产阶级报刊对于诺贝尔文学奖金所起的作用表示了极大的赞赏，一家在维也纳出版的报纸《海内·库里尔》甚至干脆称之为“反对共产主义的诺贝尔奖金”。当时，广大的苏联人民愤怒地谴责了诺贝尔文学奖金这个“西方的工具”，并且对于帕斯捷尔纳克的叛徒行径进行了一致的声讨。那一年十月二十六日的苏联《真理报》也不得不说：“反动的资产阶级用诺贝尔奖金奖赏的”，“是诬蔑社会主义革命和苏联人民的诽谤者”。就连肖洛霍夫也勉强地出来表示一下态度，谴责帕斯捷尔纳克为“国内的白俄”。
    很有讽刺意味的是，曾几何时，肖洛霍夫竟然感激涕零地接受了曾经被他谴责为奖给“国内白俄”的诺贝尔文学奖金。当然，肖洛霍夫的“才华”还不至于使他愚蠢到这种地步，即公开承认自己所接受的是一种对于叛徒的奖赏。于是，他和他所代表的一小撮现代修正主义的作家们，便想方设法地使广大的苏联人民相信：诺贝尔文学奖金已经改变了性质，已经变得异常的“客观公正”了。苏联作家协会的一位负责人甚至于恬不知耻地对美国合众社的记者发表谈话说，这是“对社会主义文学的极大褒奖”。苏共中央和苏联部长会议也亲自出马，说什么这是“社会主义现实主义文学无可争辩的成绩博得世界承认的又一证明”②。
    够了！可敬的魔术师们，尽管你们具有杰出的撒谎本领，但是，对于肖洛霍夫获奖的受宠若惊的极度兴奋，却使你们竟然“忽略”了一个重要的事实：瑞典科学院诺贝尔奖金委员会的主席埃斯特林早就对于授奖的理由作过公开的解释——并不是他们改变了立场，而是因为：“虽然肖洛霍夫先生是一位有信仰的共产党员，但在他的四卷本的巨著（即《静静的顿河》——引者）中却根本没有谈论意识形态问题”③。
    苏共中央的领导者和苏联部长会议的部长们，苏联的大大小小的评论家们，你们不是一口咬定授予肖洛霍夫诺贝尔文学奖金是对“社会主义现实主义文学”的“承认”，是“对社会主义文学的极大褒奖”吗？原来，你们所标榜的“社会主义文学”，就是这样一种资产阶级所提倡的，所谓没有思想倾向的“超阶级”的文学！你们口口声声吹嘘自己遵循列宁的原则，但你们连列宁提出的“打倒非党的文学家！打倒超人的文学家”的口号都忘得一干二净，这难道不是天大的讽刺吗？
    实际上，所谓“根本没有谈论意识形态问题”的文学，“超阶级”的文学，是根本不存在的，它只不过是资产阶级和修正主义者用来愚弄读者、欺骗读者，掩盖其为帝国主义、资产阶级服务的卑鄙目的的一种文学口号。在现在的世界上，一切文学艺术，都从属于一定的阶级，从属于一定的政治路线，因而，也就必然宣传一定的思想意识，具有一定的政治倾向。资产阶级和修正主义者所标榜的所谓不涉及思想意识的文学，实际上却在千方百计地散播着资产阶级的反动思想意识，具有反动的政治倾向。
    肖洛霍夫的《静静的顿河》就是这样的一部“巨著”。只要用马克思主义的阶级观点去分析一下这部长篇小说，就不难发现，肖洛霍夫之所以能够和帕斯捷尔纳克一起“载入诺贝尔文学奖金获得者的名册”，其中的一个重要原因，正是由于他的这部“四卷本的巨著”和帕斯捷尔纳克的《日瓦戈医生》实在是具有异曲同工之妙。如果说，在《日瓦戈医生》中，帕斯捷尔纳克是通过一个仇视十月革命、仇视社会主义制度的旧俄资产阶级知识分子日瓦戈，恶意地描绘了一幅俄国知识分子在新社会里“毁灭”的图景，对苏联红军和十月革命后的新生活进行了各种诬蔑；那么，在《静静的顿河》中，肖洛霍夫则是干脆通过歌颂一个疯狂地和红军作战的血债累累的反革命分子葛利高里，恶毒地攻击了十月社会主义革命和阶级斗争的“不人道”：它不仅摧毁了葛利高里“美好的心灵”，使葛利高里失去了“和世界相联系”的一切，而且摧毁了麦列霍夫一家人的和平幸福的宁静生活，从而对革命战争发出了不加掩饰的诅咒。
    在最近鸣锣开场的苏共第二十三次代表大会上，肖洛霍夫指责一些苏联作家为“叛徒”，并且说：“再没有比诽谤自己的母亲，卑鄙地侮辱她和动手打她更亵渎更可恶的了！”其实，这些话何尝不适用于肖洛霍夫自己呢？早在二十几年以前，他就已经用他的《静静的顿河》去诋毁十月革命的道路了，早就在动手打自己的“母亲”了，他所打的，是列宁，是斯大林，是伟大的十月社会主义革命！
    美国的资产阶级报刊以其特有的阶级敏感清楚地看到了小说《静静的顿河》的强烈的反共意识，因而表示了十分的赞赏。当肖洛霍夫接受诺贝尔文学奖金的时候，《星期六评论》就非常兴奋地写道，“获奖的这个俄国人”，“代表的正是那些攻打过红军的顿河哥萨克人”。他“通过他的小说中的人物表达了对共产主义教条和策略的某种怀疑”④。人们不难看出，西方反动的资产阶级之所以看中了肖洛霍夫，正是由于这个重要的原因，而不是由于什么别的原因。
    值得人们进一步深思的是，二十年前（一九四六年）肖洛霍夫也曾一度被提名为诺贝尔文学奖金的候选人，为什么当时的西方资产阶级没有选中他，直到十九年后（一九六五年）才又“发现了”他的“天才”？这里有什么奥妙呢？
    戳穿了，道理也很简单。在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者篡夺苏联的领导权以前，肖洛霍夫毕竟还没有那么大的胆量敢于彻底暴露自己的真面目，因此，西方资产阶级虽然对他的《静静的顿河》十分欣赏，却还不可能对他十分放心，因而采取了一种“等着瞧”的态度。那时，肖洛霍夫虽然已在自己的小说中攻击革命战争，攻击十月革命，但是，他还不得不在某些场合言不由衷地讲一些歌颂十月革命、歌颂斯大林的话。过去，他也和赫鲁晓夫一样，把斯大林称之为自己的“父亲”。直至一九五三年斯大林不幸逝世的时候，肖洛霍夫还曾假惺惺地悲呼：“父亲，别了！永别了，亲爱的终身都热爱的父亲！”他并且发誓，要把对斯大林的“神圣哀悼永远留在心灵里”⑤。
    但是，曾几何时，在一九五六年召开的苏共第二十次代表大会上，他便公开投进了疯狂地大反斯大林的赫鲁晓夫的怀抱，并且与赫鲁晓夫密切配合，对于斯大林领导时期的、苏联党在文学方面的主要领导人之一的法捷耶夫大肆攻击；写出了他的可以称之为现代修正主义文学标本的《一个人的遭遇》，成为赫鲁晓夫在苏联文艺界推行修正主义的领头羊。从此，正如他所发誓的那样，不管赫鲁晓夫飞到那里，他和他“在思想上”都永远“在一起”⑥。更其令人作呕的是，在苏共第二十二次代表大会上，也就是这位肖洛霍夫，竟然厚颜无耻地宣布自己对赫鲁晓夫具有一种“说不出口”的“男人的”“爱慕之情”。
    赫鲁晓夫及其继承者当然也格外赏识这个具有特殊作用的忠实喉舌。因为在他的头上，不仅挂着“党员作家”的头衔，而且还是斯大林奖金的获得者、历届最高苏维埃的代表。这一连串的头衔，至少在当前还可以迷惑住一部分不明真相的苏联人民以及国际文化界的人士，在他们中间起到一种欺骗作用。
    苏美合作主宰世界，这是赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的灵魂。因此，肖洛霍夫便十分起劲地在苏联读者及国际文化界中兜售苏美文化合流的货色，成为促使苏美文化合流的一个急先锋。一方面，他在苏联国内大肆宣扬资产阶级的思想意识，宣扬资产阶级的人性论，宣扬资产阶级的自由、平等、博爱，向广大的苏联读者灌输资产阶级的个人主义、人道主义、和平主义的反动思想；另一方面，他还一改过去“蜗居”的生活方式，一次又一次地出国奔波，到处鼓吹被压迫民族、被压迫阶级的作家和帝国主义、资产阶级的作家们一起采取“联合行动”，“集体地发表意见”⑦。因此，他向美帝国主义乞求说：“让我们互相往来吧！我们没有什么可争论和斗争的”⑧。因此，在欧洲作家会议上，他声嘶力竭地呼吁作家们应该象美、苏、英三国的“大政治家们和外交家们”一样，“达成协议”，“找到共同的语言”⑨。
    目的何在呢？目的就在于维护苏美两国统治集团的利益，不准别人革命，肖洛霍夫不分青红皂白地反对一切战争，无论是被压迫人民发动的革命战争，还是被侵略的民族进行的解放战争，他都要全世界的作家们“首先”跑出来说：“不要！”“而且要比那些说‘要’的人说在前头”⑩。总之，他自己背叛了革命，还不准别人革命！他不仅自己不准别人革命，而且还企图要世界上的一切作家都“联合起来”，“集体地”不准别人革命！
    正是因为这样，肖洛霍夫不仅受到赫鲁晓夫及其继承者的恩宠，而且同时受到了西方反动的资产阶级的奖赏。
    事实证明，并不是被苏联人民称之为“西方的工具”的诺贝尔文学奖金改变了性质，而是肖洛霍夫已经彻底地撕下了自己的遮羞布，变成了赤裸裸的“西方的工具”。反动的资产阶级终于找到了一个比帕斯捷尔纳克更加有用的“东方叛徒”。
    可以告诉肖洛霍夫以及肖洛霍夫所代表的一小撮现代修正主义的文艺家们：且慢得意，且慢神气吧！既然你们已经公开地背叛了无产阶级的革命事业，你们就必将遭到苏联人民及全世界一切革命人民的唾弃。历史的车轮将无情地碾碎前进道路上的一切障碍。无产阶级和全世界被压迫人民的革命事业，必将以排山倒海之势、雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，永葆其美妙之青春！而无产阶级的革命文艺，也必将在战斗中蓬勃发展，而且永远成为鼓舞人们起而斗争的战鼓和号角！注：①萨特向瑞典新闻界发表的声明，载法国《世界报》一九六四
