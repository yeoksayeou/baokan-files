    A Wholehearted, Selfless, Unyielding Proletarian Fighter
    —On Zhang Chunyu, Deputy Squad Leader of a Railway Engineering Corps Unit
    "In this lifetime, I am willing to be a handful of soil, a piece of stone, a railway tie, paving the way to communism, so that the revolutionary train can pass over me and advance at full speed!"
    　—Zhang Chunyu
    Revolutionary soldiers armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought do not seek fame or profit, do not fear hardship or death, and regard dedicating themselves to the revolutionary cause of the motherland and the people of the world as their highest ideal. Comrade Zhang Chunyu, Deputy Squad Leader and Communist Party member of the 16th Company of a Railway Engineering Corps unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is yet another wholehearted, selfless, and unyielding proletarian fighter among these revolutionary soldiers.
    He wholeheartedly thinks of the revolution, endures the greatest hardships for the people, and strives at all times to do more work for the Party.
    He wholeheartedly thinks of his comrades, cares for his comrades more than himself, and always considers others first in everything.
    Saving a Comrade at the Risk of His Own Life
    In 1965, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country were striding forward with full confidence to welcome the Third Five-Year Plan. A unit of the Railway Engineering Corps was building roads and bridges in a forest area to develop forest resources and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.
    At dawn on June 30, the soldiers of the 16th Company were gripping their pneumatic drills, fiercely attacking the hard rock. The sound of machinery echoed through the forest, and the explosions shook the mountains. The tunnel extended further and further. In the deep adit, Zhang Chunyu and his comrades were swinging their picks and shovels with great enthusiasm, loading and transporting rock debris, working hard to create high-yield achievements to welcome the Party's birthday. Suddenly, a stone the size of a helmet fell from the top of the tunnel and hit the safety helmet of soldier Dun Fengtang. Dun Fengtang immediately fell to the ground unconscious. At this time, rubble was still falling continuously, and people immediately realized that this was a sign of a major collapse. If a collapse occurred, Dun Fengtang, who was lying unconscious on the ground, would be in danger of losing his life.
    At this critical moment, Zhang Chunyu, who was working in the safe zone, felt his blood boiling: as a revolutionary soldier, how could he not save his comrade? As a Communist Party member, how could he only care about his own safety! He dashed to Dun Fengtang's side without regard for his own safety. Soldiers Wang Wujian, Qi Zengyin, and Guo Fengjiang also followed suit. At this time, the stones falling from the top of the tunnel were getting more and more numerous and larger, and it was clear that there was no time to carry Dun Fengtang away. Zhang Chunyu used all his strength to lift Dun Fengtang away, moving him out of the danger zone. At that instant, with a loud crash, a huge rock weighing more than ten thousand pounds collapsed, and the recessed edge of the rock pinned Zhang Chunyu from the waist down. His left leg was broken at the time, and three ribs on his right chest were also fractured by the rubble, and he immediately passed out. The medic on duty at the scene rushed over and immediately injected Zhang Chunyu with two doses of cardiac stimulant. Platoon Leader Xun Shenchu held his head and shouted loudly, "Zhang Chunyu, Zhang Chunyu!..."
    The boulder pinning Zhang Chunyu was like a weight on the hearts of his comrades. Everyone tried everything they could to move the boulder. But pulling with large ropes didn't work, and prying with iron bars didn't lift it. ...
    A few minutes later, Zhang Chunyu opened his eyes, as if he wanted to say something, but he couldn't make a sound. The platoon leader put his ear close to his lips and only heard him say anxiously: "Has Dun Fengtang been rescued? Are the other comrades okay?" Later, he raised his voice a little and said: "Quick... quick, go save Dun Fengtang, I'm okay, quick, go save..." The cadres and soldiers present were moved to tears when they heard Zhang Chunyu's words. But Zhang Chunyu said to everyone: "Don't be sad for me, there will be sacrifices in struggle, it's nothing to shed some blood for the revolution!" When he heard that his comrade Wang Wujian had been killed by the stones, tears welled up in his eyes, and he said sadly to the platoon leader: "Wang Wujian was a good comrade, I am the deputy squad leader, I am a party member, I didn't take good care of him, it's my responsibility!" After a pause, he said: "Yesterday I asked the clerk to send forty yuan to my family, please tell him not to send it to my house, send it to Wang Wujian's family instead..."
    The comrades tried everything they could to rescue their comrade, and finally, they brought seven hydraulic jacks to rescue him from under the boulder.
    Under the boulder, Zhang Chunyu resisted the intense physical pain with the steel-like willpower of a proletarian fighter, and by the time the rescue work was over, he had endured it for two hours and forty minutes.
    Zhang Chunyu was rescued from under the boulder, and his comrades comforted him with concern, but Zhang Chunyu didn't think of himself, but of the Party. He still remembered that tomorrow was the Party's birthday. He looked at the platoon leader beside him and said: "There are a few jiao in the pocket of my military uniform, please help me pay my Party dues!"
    This was not just a few jiao, it was a Communist Party member's red heart towards the Party!
    As the ambulance was about to start, Zhang Chunyu was still thinking about his work. He said solemnly to the platoon leader: "This collapse, some comrades inevitably have this and that kind of idea, I suggest that the leaders grasp the living thoughts and turn bad things into good things." At this time, the regimental leaders and comrades were around him, repeatedly asking him: "What else needs to be done? What do you need?" Zhang Chunyu said: "I personally don't need anything. Please bring me the works of Chairman Mao that I left on the bedside, I want to carry them with me to study hard."
    Lying in the Hospital, His Heart is With the Party
    Zhang Chunyu was sent to the hospital.
    The intense pain put him in a coma again. When he woke up, he saw so many medical personnel surrounding him and said uneasily, "Don't worry about me first, I'm fine, quickly go and rescue Dun Fengtang!" The doctors and nurses comforted him, saying, "Comrade Dun Fengtang is doing very well." But he was always worried. He thought: How is Dun Fengtang really doing? What is he thinking? I need to write him a letter! Thinking of this, he tried to lift his hand, which immediately tugged at his fractured ribs, and his mind buzzed, and beads of sweat as big as soybeans immediately rolled onto his face.
    "Write, I must write!" Zhang Chunyu tried his best to calm himself, and resolutely held the paper with his left hand and grasped the pen with his right hand, bringing the paper and pen close to his eyes, his hands suspended in the air, and he began to write tremblingly. Every stroke required him to endure great pain, he would write a few words and rest, and in this way he laboriously wrote a letter of more than eighty characters: "Comrade Dun Fengtang: Knowing that your injuries are very serious, I am very concerned and send you my regards. You must know that being injured is glorious because you were injured for developing the forest area and building roads. I hope you will study the works of Chairman Mao diligently, muster revolutionary courage, fight against your injuries, and strive to be discharged from the hospital soon, so as to better serve the people."
    When Dun Fengtang received this letter, he looked at these crooked characters and was so moved that he couldn't speak for a moment. How much deep class feeling was contained between the lines!
    On the fourth day after being admitted to the hospital, Zhang Chunyu said to the nurse, "Please bring me the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' in my satchel." The nurse said, "Your spirit has just recovered, you need to rest, study it in a few days!" Zhang Chunyu shook his head and said: "Precisely because my injuries are serious, I need to study harder. To overcome the pain, medicine alone is not enough, and even if I am cured, what use is a person without Mao Zedong Thought in his head to the people?"
    Zhang Chunyu held the book in both hands, looking excitedly at the portrait of Chairman Mao, and after a long time, he opened the book and read "Serve the People" with complete concentration. He read, thought, and thought as he read, and finally picked up his pen and wrote the following study notes:
    "Being injured is painful in the flesh, but pleasant in spirit. Because the revolution needs me to do this.
    Chairman Mao teaches us that serving the people should be 'completely' and 'thoroughly'. Although I cannot move now, there are still people around me, and there is still a lot of work in the company that cannot be ignored or left undone. I am a Communist Party member, I still have a mouth and two hands, I will do my best to do what I can do and contribute what I can contribute."
    Although Zhang Chunyu's body was lying down, his mind was not. He seemed not to know the pain. His heart was always thinking of his comrades who were working hard in the forest, and of how he could contribute to the work of the company. During his recuperation, he often wrote letters to the company, reporting his situation to the company leaders, making suggestions for improving the work, and encouraging his comrades in the squad to study the works of Chairman Mao diligently. As the deputy secretary of the regimental branch, he also constantly wrote letters to the young comrades in the company, giving them enthusiastic encouragement and help in response to their active thoughts.
    Zhang Chunyu also actively helped everyone study the works of Chairman Mao in the ward, reading newspapers and revolutionary books to them. He asked comrades to sit by his bedside and talk to them, wrote letters for them, mended their clothes, and helped the nurses fold gauze. One day, the company sent him canned fruit. At this time, a comrade in the same ward had just had an operation. Zhang Chunyu thought that he had a fever after the operation and his mouth tasted bad and he needed to eat fruit, so he immediately gave the comrade the canned fruit. Noble thoughts and exemplary deeds were like a fire burning in the hearts of his fellow patients. Since being admitted to the hospital, Zhang Chunyu has been rated as a "Five-Good" convalescent twice.
    Zhang Chunyu fought tenaciously against his injuries with amazing perseverance. His left leg had a comminuted fracture and underwent four operations. Once, in the X-ray room, manipulative reduction of the fracture was performed for more than three hours. Although it was very painful, Zhang Chunyu encouraged the doctor and said: "Do it, do it boldly, I can hold on, as long as my leg can be cured, let me return to the company to repair the railway, I can endure any pain!"
    With the efforts of the hospital, his fracture was reduced. Zhang Chunyu was very happy, and the doctors, nurses, and fellow patients were also happy for him. But at this time, an unexpected thing happened. One day, Zhang Chunyu was concentrating on reading when a fellow patient accidentally knocked off the traction hammer that was pulling his leg bone, and the leg muscles contracted sharply, and the newly connected bone was dislocated again. The severe pain made him quickly grab his leg with his hand, and when he looked up, he saw that the patient was stunned with anxiety, and the doctors and nurses rushed over. Everyone knew how much pain Zhang Chunyu had endured in the past few months, and this manipulative reduction of the fracture was now ineffective, making his leg treatment even more difficult. Zhang Chunyu also thought of this, but he thought even deeper and further. He thought: "We are all class brothers, class feelings weigh a thousand catties, I must not hurt the feelings between comrades because of my personal pain." He comforted the patient and said: "It's okay, it's okay, just reset it."
    Zhang Chunyu's leg injury became more and more difficult to treat, and his comrades were anxious for him. The doctor said to him: "We will do everything we can to cure your leg, but you must also be mentally prepared, in case it can't be cured..." Zhang Chunyu pondered for a while and said with full confidence: "I hope my leg can be cured so that I can better participate in socialist construction and build more roads for the people. It doesn't matter if it can't be cured, Chairman Mao said that a person's ability may be great or small, as long as he is completely selfless and devoted to serving the people, he is a person who is beneficial to the people. I still have two hands, and I can still work for the Party and serve the people."
    Relying Entirely on Mao Zedong Thought
    The heart-stirring heroic behavior and shining communist spirit shown by the young Railway Engineering Corps soldier Zhang Chunyu are not accidental. This is the result of the nourishment of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the result of his tempering in labor and work under the shining light of Mao Zedong Thought.
    In 1941, Zhang Chunyu was born into a poor peasant family in Shijiazhuang. After liberation, he grew up in sweet water and went to school until the second year of high school. In March 1963, Zhang Chunyu joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Engineering Corps with revolutionary enthusiasm.
    That was an extraordinary spring. Responding to the Party's call, the Railway Engineering Corps sounded the horn of opening the way for the forest industry, and marched into the forest in a mighty manner. When Zhang Chunyu arrived at the unit, the primitive forest was already boiling, and tense labor awaited him. Coming from the plains to the forest area, from studying in school to participating in arduous physical labor, was a great change for Zhang Chunyu. Here was a silvery world of white snow, with endless forest resources waiting to be developed. But compared with the interior of the motherland and his hometown, it was still desolate, with vast forests, wild animals, and severe climate. The troops lived in tents and often couldn't get vegetables or clean water. Needless to say, it was a tense and arduous task to shoulder burdens, swing picks and shovels, carry stones, and dig frozen earth in such a harsh environment. At this moment, how much Zhang Chunyu needed a guiding light, how much he needed a spiritual force to encourage him to overcome the difficult labor!
    At this time, the troops launched a upsurge in learning from the great communist fighter Lei Feng. The Party branch of the company where Zhang Chunyu was located promptly studied the ideological situation of the new soldiers and launched Party members and League members to carry out ideological mutual assistance. Quotation boards of Chairman Mao were hung everywhere on the construction site. During rest time, comrades would take out Chairman Mao's books to read. The forest area became a university for learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. One night, Squad Leader Zhou Yuxing, a Communist Party member, talked to Zhang Chunyu and gave him a "Selected Readings from Mao Zedong's Works," encouraging him: "Study Chairman Mao's books well, with Mao Zedong Thought, you will have inexhaustible energy, you can overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."
    Zhang Chunyu took the book and read it eagerly, as if he had found a treasure. He thought: Isn't it precisely because Comrade Lei Feng read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao that he grew into a communist fighter? He wrote to his sister, asking her to find a way to buy a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and send it to him. When working, he took Chairman Mao's works to the site and read them during breaks; when marching, he put Chairman Mao's works in his satchel and learned wherever he went. Festivals and holidays almost became his best "study days." One Saturday night, the comrades were already asleep, and sentry Hua Zigen found a faint light shining from the tent. It turned out that Zhang Chunyu was lying under a small oil lamp, concentrating on writing study notes. The sentry advised him to rest, but he smiled and said: "It doesn't matter if I sleep a little less, but I can't do without reading Chairman Mao's works, otherwise it will affect my thinking and work in the long run." In this way, the busier the construction and the less time for study, the more Zhang Chunyu seized the time to persist in studying the works of Chairman Mao. Since joining the army, Zhang Chunyu has read through Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" during the tense labor gaps, especially "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Combat Liberalism," which he often read and reread. He also wrote a large number of study notes and diaries. Chairman Mao's golden words gave him endless power, and a red sun rose in his heart. In his diary, Zhang Chunyu wrote with passion: "The pointer on the clock is always moving forward, and it needs people to wind it up. I should be like a pointer and move forward forever, so I must truly learn Mao Zedong Thought!" "Only by studying Chairman Mao's works well can we stand firm in the face of great storms, can we distinguish right from wrong, not lose our direction, stand firm on the proletarian stand, can we hold our weapons tightly, can we defend our regime, and can we carry the revolution through to the end."
    Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Zhang Chunyu consciously and selflessly tempered himself in labor. In the cold winter, the north wind howled, and snow and fog filled the sky. Zhang Chunyu and his comrades pushed away the snow on the mountain, drilled blasting holes, and blasted frozen earth. When there were not enough sledgehammers, he picked up a steel drill and punched holes in the frozen earth. Where the wind was strong, he stood there; where the soil was hard, he charged there. Zhang Chunyu's leather hat and eyebrows were covered with frost, but his dark face was sweating. The more he worked, the more energetic he became, and the steel drill in his hand was more powerful with each strike, hitting the frozen earth until it splashed and his whole body was steaming with heat, and he couldn't even wear his cotton clothes.
    In the arduous labor, Zhang Chunyu repeatedly studied the article "Serve the People." Chairman Mao's teachings made him see the light in difficult situations. He wrote in his diary: "Whether a person sincerely listens to the Party and Chairman Mao... needs to be tested in the most arduous and difficult environment and conditions. If he can withstand it, he is a true, strong, brave, and fearless person." Under this ideological guidance, the heavier the burden, the more he rushed to take it; the more dangerous the situation, the more he charged to the front. One day, when excavating the tunnel portal, it was found that there were several large stones cracked on the steep cliff at the tunnel entrance, and they might roll down at any time. The danger must be eliminated immediately to ensure the safety of the construction personnel under the cliff. Without hesitation, Zhang Chunyu picked up a steel drill and asked the squad leader, "I'll go up and pry them down." Squad Leader Zhang Sanmin said, "It's too dangerous there, don't go." Saying that, he grabbed a steel drill himself and prepared to go up. Zhang Chunyu grabbed the squad leader and said: "You are the squad leader, you have to take care of the whole squad, I'll go!" While saying that, he fastened the safety rope and bravely climbed up the two-zhang-high steep cliff. He couldn't stand firm on the cliff and couldn't exert his strength. Zhang Chunyu fought hard to eliminate the danger. After more than twenty minutes, he finally pried off the rocks.
    Over the years, Zhang Chunyu and his comrades worked together with a pair of hands, a pickaxe, and a pair of baskets to build roads and railways in the forest area, and a large amount of timber was continuously transported to all parts of the country. New towns have appeared in the formerly quiet dense forest; electric lights like night pearls have lit up in the places where will-o'-the-wisps used to flicker; new factories have been built in the wilderness where tigers roared and wolves howled. All this made Zhang Chunyu deeply feel the glory of the Railway Engineering Corps and the greatness of labor. Seeing with his own eyes that the poor and blank face of the motherland was changing day by day, and that socialist construction was developing rapidly, he realized even more that he was building socialist roads here today and laying the foundation for communism. Zhang Chunyu's mind became wider and wider, and his vision became farther and farther. He felt that dedicating himself to such a magnificent cause was the greatest pleasure and the greatest happiness in his life. In the past, he felt that this forest area was remote and desolate, but now he regarded it as a "natural forest park," "the mountains are full of flowers and plants that people love, and the warm wind blows the trees and claps their hands." In the past, he only planned to serve for three years, "and celebrate his achievements when he returned home," but now he is determined to "be a railway soldier for the rest of his life and build roads for the people for the rest of his life."
    With a selfless communist spirit, Zhang Chunyu cared for and loved his comrades even more. In any matter, he always thought of others first, as he said in his diary: "The difficulties of the comrades are also my own difficulties; the happiness of the comrades is my true happiness." As long as it is beneficial to the comrades, he is willing to endure even if he is tired. Once, the company went out to perform a task and encountered a small river on the way. The river was flowing with freshly melted snow water. Zhang Chunyu waded across the river, and his feet were frozen and painful. At this time, what he thought of was not how to warm his feet, but how not to let others freeze. He returned and carried several weak comrades across. The comrades were very uneasy when they saw his red feet. He said: "It's nothing, as long as I can do something for everyone, I feel happy!" In tunnel construction, there was a lot of water seepage underground, and it was necessary to wear water shoes to work. When some water shoes were worn out, Zhang Chunyu gave the good ones to others and wore the worn ones himself. With such a noble communist ideology, what difficulties can stop him from moving forward! What miracles can't be created!
    Now, under the care of the hospital party committee and with the careful treatment and care of the medical staff, the severely injured left leg of Zhang Chunyu has been saved, and his condition is gradually improving. The doctors say that after a period of time, he will be discharged from the hospital to work.
    In this test of life and death, in the struggle against disability, Zhang Chunyu's will has become even stronger. He tirelessly studies the works of Chairman Mao and is determined to always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao and always serve the Chinese people and the people of the world. He made a vow: In this lifetime, I am willing to be a handful of soil, a piece of stone, a railway tie, paving the way to communism, so that the revolutionary train can pass over me and advance at full speed!

    一心为公的无产阶级硬骨头战士
    ——记铁道兵某部副班长张春玉
    “我这一辈子愿作一把泥土、一块石子、一根枕木，铺在通往共产主义的大道上，让革命的列车从我身上通过，全速前进！”
    　——张春玉
    伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，把献身于祖国和世界人民的革命事业当作最高理想。中国人民解放军铁道兵某部十六连副班长、共产党员张春玉同志，就是这些革命战士当中的又一个一心为公、意志坚强的无产阶级硬骨头战士。
    他一心想着革命，为人民吃最大的苦，时时刻刻争取为党多做工作。
    他一心想着同志，关心战友胜于关心自己，事事处处首先替别人打算。
    危急关头舍身救人
    一九六五年，全国人民在党的领导下，正信心百倍地为迎接第三个五年计划而阔步前进。铁道兵一支部队，在某地林区筑路架桥，开发森林资源，积极参加祖国社会主义建设。
    六月三十日凌晨，十六连的战士们正紧握风枪，向坚硬的岩石猛烈冲击。机器声响彻林海，爆破声震得山摇地动，隧道又向前延伸了。深邃的导峒里，张春玉和战友们干劲十足地挥舞着镐锹，装运石碴，为创造高产成绩迎接党的生日，紧张地劳动着。突然，一块钢盔大的石头从隧道顶部掉下来，打在战士敦凤堂的安全帽上。敦凤堂立即昏倒在地。这时候碎石仍在不断下落，人们立刻意识到这是要发生大塌方的迹象。而如果塌方下来，昏倒在地下的敦凤堂就会有生命危险。
    在这万分危急的时刻，在安全区作业的张春玉，周身热血沸腾：是革命战士哪能不救战友，是共产党员岂能只顾个人安危！他不顾一切地一个箭步扑到敦凤堂身边。战士王物件、齐增印、郭凤江也相继而上。这时，隧道顶部的石块，掉得越来越多，越来越大，眼看抬走敦凤堂已经来不及了。张春玉用全身力气将敦凤堂猛地一掀，使他脱离险区。就在这一瞬间，轰隆一声巨响，一块重达一万多斤的巨石塌下来，巨石边缘的凹陷处把张春玉的腰部以下卡住了。他的左腿骨当时就被压断，右胸三根肋骨也被碎石砸折，顿时昏迷过去。在现场值班的卫生员赶来，立即给张春玉注射了两针强心剂。排长寻慎初搂抱着他的头，大声地喊着：“张春玉，张春玉！……”
    巨石卡在张春玉的身上，就象卡在同志们的心上。大家想尽了各种方法来搬掉这块巨石。可是，用大绳拉，拉不动，铁棍撬，撬不起。……
    几分钟以后，张春玉睁开了眼睛，象要说什么，可又发不出声音来，排长把耳朵贴近他的嘴唇，只听他急切地说：“敦凤堂救出来没有？别的同志都好吗？”后来他提高了一些声音说：“快……快去救敦凤堂，我不要紧，快，快去救……”在场的干部战士听到张春玉这些话，一个个感动得热泪盈眶。张春玉却对大家说：“别为我难过，要奋斗就会有牺牲，为革命流点血算不了什么！”当他听说战友王物件被石头压住牺牲了，泪水不禁夺眶而出，他悲痛地对排长说：“王物件是个好同志，我是副班长，我是党员，没有照顾好他，我有责任！”停了一会又说：“昨天我托文书给家里寄四十块钱，请告诉他，别往我家寄了，寄到王物件家里去吧……”
    同志们想尽了各种办法抢救战友，最后，大家扛来了七个千斤顶，才把他从巨石下抢救出来。
    张春玉在巨石下，用无产阶级战士钢铁般的顽强意志抵抗着肉体上的剧烈伤痛，到抢救工作结束时，他已整整度过了两小时又四十分钟。
    张春玉从巨石下抢救出来了，同志们关切地安慰他，但是张春玉没有想到自己，却想着党，他仍然记得明天就是党的生日。他望着身边的排长说：“我那件军装口袋里边有几角钱，请帮我交了党费吧！”
    这哪里是几角钱，这是一个共产党员对党的一颗红心啊！
    救护车就要开动了，张春玉还一心想着工作。他郑重地对排长说：“这次塌方，有些同志难免有这样那样的想法，我建议领导抓好活思想，把坏事变好事。”这时，团首长和同志们围在他的身边，再三地问他：“还有什么事要办？需要什么东西不？”张春玉说：“我个人什么也不需要。请把我放在床头的毛主席著作拿来，我要随身带着好好学习。”
    身在病房心向党
    张春玉被送到医院里。
    剧烈的伤疼，使他又处于昏迷状态。当他清醒过来的时候，见那么多医护人员围着自己，就不安地说：“你们先别管我，我没关系，快去抢救敦凤堂吧！”医生护士安慰他说：“敦凤堂同志很好。”但他老是放心不下。他想：敦凤堂到底怎么样了？他心里在想些什么呢？我要给他写封信才好呢！想到这里，试着把手往上一抬，一下就牵动了折断的肋骨，脑子“嗡”地一下，只觉得天旋地转，黄豆大的汗珠立刻滚到脸上。
    “写，一定要写！”张春玉极力镇静着，毅然地用左手拿着纸，右手握住笔，把纸笔凑近眼前，双手悬空，颤抖地写了起来。每写一笔，都要忍受极大的疼痛，写几个字休息一下，就这样艰难地写了八十多个字的信：“敦凤堂同志：知道你的伤很重，很是挂念，特向你问候。你一定知道，负伤是光荣的，因为你是为开发林区修路负伤的。希望你好好学习毛主席著作，鼓起革命勇气，与伤残作斗争，争取早日出院，更好地为人民服务。”
    敦凤堂接到这封信，看着这些歪歪扭扭的字，感动得一时说不出话来。这字里行间包含着多么深厚的阶级感情呀！
    入院后的第四天，张春玉对护士说：“请你把我挎包里的《毛泽东选集》拿给我。”护士说：“你精神刚刚恢复，需要静养，过几天再学吧！”张春玉摇摇头说：“正因为我的伤重，才更需要好好学习。要战胜伤痛，光靠药是不行的，就是治好了，一个头脑里没有毛泽东思想的人，对人民又有什么用？”
    张春玉双手捧着书，激动地望着毛主席的像，好长一阵子，才翻开书，全神贯注地读着《为人民服务》。他读着，想着，想想读读，最后拿起笔来写下了这样一篇学习心得：
    “负伤，肉体上是痛苦的，但精神上是愉快的。因为这是革命需要我这样做。
    毛主席教导我们为人民服务要‘完全’‘彻底’，现在虽说我不能动，可是周围有群众，连队还有许多工作，不能不管，不能不做。我是一个共产党员，我还有一张口，两只手，我要尽我最大的力量，去做我所能做的工作，贡献出我能贡献出的一分力量。”
    张春玉虽然身子躺下了，但是思想没有躺下，他好象不知道伤疼，他的一颗心时时刻刻想的是在林海里紧张劳动的战友，想的是怎样能为连队工作出一把力。他在疗伤的日子里，还经常给连里写信，向连队首长汇报自己的情况，提出改进工作的意见，鼓励本班战友好好学习毛主席著作。作为团支部副书记，他还不断地给连里的青年战友写信，针对他们的活思想，热情地给以鼓励和帮助。
    张春玉在病房里还积极帮助大家学习毛主席著作，给大家读报、读革命书籍。他找同志们坐在自己床边谈心，替同志们写信，给同志们补衣服，帮助护士叠纱布。一天，连里给他送来了水果罐头，这时同病室有个同志刚做完手术，张春玉想，手术以后发烧，嘴里没味，需要吃水果，就马上把罐头送给了这个同志。高贵的思想，模范的事迹，象一把火燃烧在病友们的心间。入院以来，张春玉就两次被评为五好休养员。
    张春玉以惊人的毅力，与伤残进行着顽强的搏斗。他的左腿是粉碎性骨折，先后经过四次手术。有一次在爱克斯光室里，做骨折手法复位，进行了三个多小时，虽然痛得很难受，可是张春玉却鼓励医生说：“做吧，大胆地做吧，我能坚持住，只要能治好我的腿，让我回到连队修铁路，任何痛苦我都能忍受住！”
    经医院的努力治疗，他的折骨复了位。张春玉心里很高兴，医生、护士和病友们也为他高兴。可就在这时，一件意外的事情发生了。一天，张春玉正在专心地看书，同室一个病友不小心碰掉了他牵引腿骨的牵引锤，腿部肌肉猛然收缩，新接好的骨头又错开了。剧烈的疼痛使他连忙用手握住了腿，抬头一看，只见那个病友急得发呆了，医生护士连忙赶来。大家都知道，在这几个月里，张春玉忍受了多少疼痛，这次骨折手法复位又失去了作用，他的腿治疗更加困难了。张春玉也想到了这些，但是，他却想得更深更远。他想：“我们都是阶级兄弟，阶级感情千斤重，我决不能因为个人的痛苦，伤害了同志间的感情。”他安慰那个病友说：“不要紧，不要紧，再整一整就行了。”
    张春玉的腿伤越来越不好治，同志们为他焦急。医生对他说：“我们一定尽一切努力治好你的腿，但是你也得作好思想准备，万一治不好……”张春玉沉思了一会，满怀信心地说：“我希望能治好我的腿，让我更好地参加社会主义建设，为人民修更多的路。实在治不好也不要紧，毛主席说，一个人能力有大小，只要毫不利己、专门利人，就是一个有益于人民的人。我还有两只手，照样可以为党工作，为人民服务。”
    全靠毛泽东思想
    在年轻的铁道兵战士张春玉身上表现出来的这种震撼人心的英雄行为和闪闪发光的共产主义精神，并不是偶然的。这是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果，是他在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在劳动和工作中千锤百炼的结果。
    一九四一年，张春玉出生在石家庄一个贫苦农民的家庭。解放以后，他在甜水里长大，上学上到高中二年级。一九六三年三月，张春玉满怀革命热情，参加了中国人民解放军铁道兵部队。
    那是一个不平凡的春天。铁道兵部队响应党的召唤，吹响了为森林工业开道的号角，浩浩荡荡向林海进军。张春玉到部队时，原始森林已经沸腾起来，紧张的劳动在等待着他。从平原来到林区，从学校读书到参加艰苦的体力劳动，对张春玉来说是一个极大的变化。这里是一片白雪皑皑的银色世界，有无穷无尽的森林资源，等待开发。但是同祖国内地和他的家乡比起来，这里还是荒凉的，林海茫茫，野兽出没，气候严寒。部队住的是帐篷，往往吃不上青菜，喝不到清水。在这样艰苦的环境里，要挑起担子，挥舞锹镐，运石头，刨冻土，不用说，这是多么紧张而又艰巨的劳动。此时此刻，张春玉多么需要一盏指路明灯，多么需要一种精神力量鼓舞他闯过艰苦的劳动关！
    就在这时候，部队掀起了学习伟大的共产主义战士雷锋的热潮。张春玉所在的连队党支部及时研究了新战士的思想情况，发动党团员进行思想互助。工地上到处挂着毛主席的语录板，一到休息时间，同志们就拿出毛主席的书来读，林区成了活学活用毛主席著作的大学校。一天晚上，班长、共产党员周玉兴找张春玉谈心，并且把一本《毛泽东著作选读》送给张春玉，鼓励他说：“好好读毛主席的书，有了毛泽东思想，就有使不完的劲，就能排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    张春玉拿到这本书，就象得了宝贝一样，如饥似渴地读了起来。他想：雷锋同志不正是因为读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，才成长为共产主义战士的吗？他写信给姐姐，请她想办法买了一套《毛泽东选集》寄来。施工，他把毛主席著作带上现场，利用工间休息时间读；行军，他把毛主席著作装到挎包里，走到哪里学到哪里。节日和假日几乎成了他最好的“学习日”。有一个星期六的晚上，同志们已经睡了，哨兵华子根发现帐篷里露出微弱的灯光，原来是张春玉伏在一盏小油灯下，正在聚精会神地写学习心得。哨兵劝他休息，他笑笑说：“少睡一会觉没有关系，不读毛主席著作可不行，时间长了会影响思想和工作。”就这样，施工越忙，学习时间越少，张春玉越是抓紧时间坚持学习毛主席著作。入伍以来，张春玉利用紧张的劳动空隙，通读了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，特别是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《反对自由主义》，更是经常读，反复读。他还写下了大量的学习心得和日记。毛主席的那些金光灿烂的话，给了他无穷无尽的力量，心里象升起了一轮红太阳。在日记中，张春玉满怀激情地写道：“钟表上的指针总是向前走的，它需要人给它上劲。我应该象指针一样永向前走，就必须把毛主席思想真正学到手！”“只有把毛主席著作学习好，才能在大风大浪里站得稳，才能辩明是非，不失方向，站稳无产阶级立场，才能握紧我们手中的武器，才能捍卫我们的政权，才能将革命进行到底。”
    在毛泽东思想的指引下，张春玉自觉地忘我地在劳动中磨炼自己。隆冬，北风呼号，雪雾漫天。张春玉和同志们在山上推开雪层，打炮眼，爆破冻土。铁锤不够用，他就抱起一根钢钎在冻土上冲炮眼。那里风大，他往那里站；那里土硬，他往那里冲。张春玉戴的皮帽上和眉毛上挂满了冰霜，黝黑的脸上却淌着汗水。他越干越起劲，手中的钢钎一钎比一钎有力，直砸得冻土飞溅，直砸得浑身热气腾腾，连棉衣也穿不住了。
    在艰苦的劳动中，张春玉反复学习《为人民服务》这篇文章。毛主席的教导，使他在困难的情况下看到了光明。他在日记中写道：“一个人是不是真心的听党和毛主席的话，……需要在最艰苦、最困难的环境和条件下来考验自己。经得住，才是一个真正的、坚强的、勇敢的、大无畏的人。”在这个思想指导下，越是重担子他越抢着挑，越是遇到危险他越是冲在前头。有一天，开挖隧道峒门的时候，发现峒门口的陡崖上有几块大石头裂开了，说不定什么时候要滚落下来。必须立即排除险情，保证崖下施工人员的安全。张春玉毫不犹豫地拿起一根钢钎向班长请求说：“我上去把它撬下来。”班长张三民说：“那里太危险，你不要去。”说着自己抓起一根钢钎准备上。张春玉一把拉住班长说：“你是班长，要照顾全班，我去！”一边说一边系上保险绳，就奋勇地爬上两丈高的陡崖。崖上站不住脚，使不上劲，张春玉奋力排险，经过二十多分钟，终于撬掉了岩石。
    几年来，张春玉和战友们一道凭着一双手，一把镐，一对筐，在林区修筑起一条条公路和铁路，大量木材不断地运往祖国各地。从前寂静的密林，出现了新兴的城镇；从前磷火闪闪的地方，亮起了夜明珠似的电灯；从前虎啸狼嚎的荒野，建起了崭新的工厂。所有这一切，使张春玉深深地感到铁道兵的光荣，劳动的伟大，亲眼看到祖国一穷二白的面貌在一天天地改变，社会主义建设在迅速发展，更加认识到今天在这里修的是社会主义的路，奠的是共产主义的基。张春玉的胸怀越来越开阔，目光越来越远大。他觉得献身于这样壮丽的事业，是一生最大的愉快，最大的幸福。过去，他感到这片林区偏僻荒凉，现在把它看成是“天然的森林公园”，“满山花草惹人爱，暖风吹树拍手欢”；过去，他只打算服役三年，“期满回家庆丰功”，现在决心“当一辈子铁道兵，为人民修一辈子路”。
    张春玉有了无私的共产主义胸怀，对同志更加关心，更加热爱了。一事当前，他总是先替别人打算，正如他在日记中说的：“同志们的困难，也就是我本人的困难；同志们的幸福，才是我真正的幸福。”只要对同志有好处，哪怕自己再苦再累，也心甘情愿。一次连队外出执行任务，途中遇到一条小河，河里流着刚刚融化的雪水，张春玉从河里趟过去，两脚冻得发痛。在这时候，他想到的不是怎么暖暖自己的脚，而是怎么能不让别人受冻。他又返回来，把几个体弱的同志背了过去。同志们看到他冻得通红的双脚，心里很不安。他说：“没有什么，只要能为大家作点事，我就感到幸福！”在隧道施工中，由于地下渗水很多，需要穿着水鞋作业。有的水鞋穿破了，张春玉把好的让给别人穿，自己穿破的。有了这样崇高的共产主义思想，还有什么困难能够阻挡他前进！还有什么奇迹不能创造！
    现在，张春玉在医院党委的关怀下，经过医护人员精心的治疗护理，那条受重伤的左腿保存下来了，伤势日渐好转。医生们说，再过一个时期，他就可以出院工作了。
    张春玉在这次生死的考验中，在和伤残的斗争中，意志更加坚强了。他不倦地学习毛主席著作，决心永远做毛主席的好战士，永远为中国人民和世界人民服务。他立下誓言：我这一辈子愿作一把泥土、一块石子、一根枕木，铺在通往共产主义的大道上，让革命的列车从我身上通过，全速前进！
