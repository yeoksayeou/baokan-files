    We Must Write a Grand History of the Laboring People
    Wang Yixuan, Retired Worker from Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine
    After reading the materials exposing Wu Han in the newspaper, I am extremely angry at the words and deeds of this anti-Party element. Wu Han praises the heads of the exploiting classes in history and slanders the peasant masses. In reality, he is using the past to criticize the present, opposing the new society, opposing the Communist Party, and hating us laboring people.
    It is complete nonsense to say that some people in the feudal ruling class could stand on the side of the people and do good things for the people. The officials of the feudal ruling class were all big and small landlord heads. There has never been a landlord who could do good things for the people.
    My father worked for a landlord in Dingzhenzi Village, Wuqing County, and he couldn't even support my mother, my blind grandmother, and me. I was hungry from the day I was born. When I was five years old, my blind grandmother used me as her eyes, having me lead her with a stick to beg for food.
    That autumn, my father was driving a cart for the landlord to haul corn stalks. He was so hungry and tired that he fainted and fell off the cart, and an iron wheel ran over his chest. The people working with him found the landlord's steward and asked him to take him to get medical treatment. The landlord's steward said, "The autumn harvest is important; what does a person matter?" My father died in eight or nine days. After my father died, the landlord Wu Laosan forced my mother to remarry, but my mother refused at all costs. The landlord stomped his foot and said fiercely, "Your man still owes me thirty-five yuan, bring it here!" In fact, the money had long been paid off. My mother asked the landlord for proof. Wu Laosan became enraged with shame, grabbed my mother's hair, punched and kicked her, dragged her into the landlord's house, and forced her to work. For nine whole years, my mother and I didn't see each other.
    When I was fourteen, the landlord saw that I was quite tall and could be used as a full person, so he kept me. Once I entered the landlord's house, I was never idle again. At night, my mother and I lived in the cowshed, bitten by mosquitoes in the hot weather, and blown by wind and snow in the winter. One winter was particularly cold, and my mother and I were so cold that we couldn't sleep, so we slept next to the cow's belly. The landlord disliked us for having a "smell" and drove us out. My mother and I then began a life of begging for food.
    Later, I went to work at the Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Mine. I pulled large baskets for the foreman, each basket weighing more than two hundred catties, with a quota of fifty trips per shift. One day, I was pulling a basket when the foreman asked me, "How many trips have you pulled?" I said, "Nineteen trips." He cursed as soon as he heard, "Damn it, do you still want your wages?" After cursing, he hit me three times with a shovel and also splashed me with foul water. Once, several of us workers were pulling mules to transport coal in the well. Because the road was slippery, the mule slipped and fell into the ditch, pinning a worker down. I quickly went to save him, and three other workers came to help. Coincidentally, a British capitalist happened to come across it. He mumbled something, kicked and beat us, and wrote down our work card numbers in his notebook. Later, all four of us were "fired." I went to the manager to ask him why we were "fired"? The manager said, "Bastards, the mule fell, you saved the person instead of the mule. Drowning a mule costs a hundred-odd yuan, but a person's life is only worth forty yuan. Saving the mule earns you three days' work, saving the person gets you fired." What kind of world is this? A person isn't even worth as much as a mule! But Wu Han wants to obliterate this history of people eating people in the old society and oppose the new society, which we will never allow.
    The old society was also a history of the people opposing the reactionary ruling class and carrying out revolutionary struggles. How many peasant uprisings have there been in Chinese history to resist the feudal ruling class? Take our Kailuan Coal Mine as an example. Before liberation, for many years, our working class always unyieldingly resisted the exploitation and oppression of imperialist elements, capitalists, and feudal bosses. On October 23, 1922, the Kailuan Five Mines workers, under the leadership of the Party, launched a major strike. Three days after the strike, the Indian troops stationed in the mine were dispatched to drive out the workers and force them to resume work. The workers' "Maintenance Team" fought with the Indian troops. The Indian troops opened fire, and the "Maintenance Team" and the workers fought back valiantly with axes, pick handles, and stones. Although the Indian troops had guns, they were beaten by the workers until their heads were bloodied, and they fled back into the mine with their heads in their hands.
    The British capitalists demanded that the Tianjin consulate send troops to suppress the strike. The British soldiers came by train. Several hundred members of the workers' "Dare-to-Die Corps" also set off in a mighty force. The workers' "Dare-to-Die Corps" held small red flags and shouted the slogan "Down with imperialism!" and rushed all the way to Huangtugang outside the South Gate of Zhaogezhuang Mine. Then, the "Maintenance Team," the "Transportation Team," and the masses of workers also arrived. Seeing the great momentum of the worker masses, the British soldiers had no choice but to drive in reverse and flee.
    The evil invaders and exploiters were not reconciled to their defeat. A few days later, Yang Bangzi, the chief of the Zhili Provincial Police Department, led more than a dozen trains of police to suppress them. The "Dare-to-Die Corps," "Maintenance Team," "Transportation Team," and the workers all rushed to Guye Station. Everyone fought with them at all costs.
    The imperialist reactionaries and capitalists armed repression of the workers three times, but they did not frighten the workers. The more we fought, the braver we became, and the strike struggle lasted for twenty-six days.
    Now, the Party calls on us to write mine history, write the family history of the working class, and write the history of the revolutionary struggles of the laboring people, in order to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the working class. But Wu Han wants us to write the history of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, and praise the heads of the exploiting classes. This is deliberately singing a different tune from us. Today, we laboring people have become the masters of the country. Are we not to write the history of the revolutionary struggles of the working class under the leadership of the Party, but instead write the history of the oppression of the people by imperialist elements, capitalists, and feudal bosses, and praise these invaders and exploiters?
    Wu Han said: If we write the history of the revolutionary struggles of the laboring people, "the bright side of history is lost," and "history almost becomes pitch black, gloomy." He also said, "We say that all our ancestors were bad people," and "We are all descendants of bad people." How arrogant these words are! We tell you: Wu Han! You are not allowed to confuse right and wrong and reverse black and white. Who are the ancestors you revere? They are slave owners, landlords, and capitalists. Our ancestors are the oppressed and exploited laboring people. The revolutionary struggle of the laboring people is the bright side of history, and we are going to write a grand history of the laboring people's struggle. Only by writing the history of the laboring people will we laboring people be able to hold our heads high!

    我们要大写劳动人民的历史
    开滦赵各庄矿退休老工人　王义轩
    我看了报上揭露的吴晗的材料以后，对这个反党分子的言行，十分气愤。吴晗吹捧历史上剥削阶级的头子，污蔑农民群众，实际上是借古非今，反对新社会，反对共产党，仇视我们劳动人民。
    封建统治阶级的一些人，能站在人民一边，为人民做好事，这完全是胡说。封建统治阶级的官吏，都是一些大小地主头子。从来就没有一个地主能给人民作好事的。
    我爸爸在武清县丁甄子村给地主家扛活，连我妈我瞎姥姥和我三口人也养不了。我一生下来就挨饿。五岁的时候，瞎姥姥就拿我当眼使，叫我拉着棍领她去要饭。
    那年秋天，我爸爸赶着车给地主拉玉黍秸。他又饿又累，一阵昏迷，从车上摔了下来，铁轱辘从胸脯上轧了过去。一起扛活的人找地主管家，要求拉人去医伤。地主管家说：“秋收要紧，人算个啥。”我爸爸没呆上八九天就死了。我爸爸死后，地主吴老三逼着我妈改嫁，妈妈死活不依。地主把脚一跺，恶狠狠地说：“你爷们还欠我三十五块钱，拿来！”其实这钱早就还完了，我妈向地主要证据。吴老三老羞成怒，揪住我妈的头发，拳打脚踢，把我妈拉进地主的家里，强迫她干活。整整九年，我们母子没有见过面。
    我十四岁那年，地主见我个儿挺高，可以顶个人使，就把我留下。一进地主家，我每天就再也不得闲。晚上我和妈住在牛棚里，热天蚊子咬，冬天风吹雪打。有一年冬天特别冷，我们娘俩冻得睡不着觉，就贴着牛肚子去睡。地主嫌我们有“味”，把我们撵出来。我和我妈，就过起了讨饭的生活。
    以后，我到了开滦赵各庄矿做工。我在包工大柜拉大筐，每筐二百多斤重，定额一班五十趟。有一天，我正在拉筐，包工问我：“你拉几趟了？”我说：“十九趟了。”他一听就骂：“他妈的，你还要工钱不？”骂完就打了我三板劈，还用锹往我身上撩臭水。有一次，我们几个工人正在井下拉着骡子运煤，由于道滑，骡子滑倒在水沟里，压住了一个工人。我赶紧去救人，另外三个工人也来帮忙。正巧一个英国资本家碰上了。他嘴里嘟噜着，对我们又踢又打，把我们的工牌号码都写在他的本子上。以后我们四个人就都被“刷”了。我去找总管，问他为啥“刷”我们？总管说：“混蛋，骡子倒了，你们救人不救骡子，淹死一头骡子一百多块钱，死一个人才四十块钱。救骡子赏你三个工，救人就刷了你。”这叫什么世道？人还不如骡子值钱！可是吴晗却要想抹煞旧社会这种人吃人的历史，反对新社会，我们决不允许。
    旧社会也是人民反对反动统治阶级，进行革命斗争的历史。中国历史上有过多少次农民起义，反抗封建统治阶级。就拿我们开滦煤矿来说，解放以前，多少年来，我们工人阶级始终不屈地反抗帝国主义分子、资本家、封建把头的剥削和压迫。一九二二年十月二十三日，开滦五矿工人在党的领导下，展开了大罢工。罢工三天以后，驻矿的印度兵出动了，从矿里赶工人，强迫工人复工。工人的“维持队”就和印度兵进行斗争。印度兵开枪射击，“维持队”和工人们就用斧子、镐把、石头英勇还击。虽然印度兵手里有枪，还是被工人打得头破血流，抱头逃回了矿内。
    英国资本家向天津领事馆要求派兵镇压罢工。英国兵坐着火车来了。工人的几百名“敢死队”也浩浩荡荡地出发了。工人“敢死队”手里拿着小红旗，高喊：“打倒帝国主义！”的口号，一直冲到赵各庄矿南门外黄土岗上。接着，“维持队”、“交通队”和工人群众也赶来了。英国兵见工人群众声势浩大，只好开着倒车逃跑了。
    万恶的侵略者和剥削者并不甘心失败。过了几天，直隶省警务处长杨帮子，带领十几列车巡警前来镇压。“敢死队”、“维持队”、“交通队”和工人们全冲向古冶车站。大家不顾一切地和他们搏斗。
    帝国主义反动派和资本家三次武装镇压工人，没有把工人吓倒，我们越战越勇，罢工斗争一直坚持了二十六天。
    现在，党号召我们写矿史，写工人阶级的家史，写劳动人民的革命斗争史，以便发扬工人阶级的革命光荣传统。而吴晗却要我们写帝王将相的历史，歌颂剥削阶级的头子，这是存心和我们唱反调。今天我们劳动人民已经做了国家的主人，难道我们不写工人阶级在党领导下的革命斗争史，而去写帝国主义分子、资本家、封建把头压迫人民的历史，歌颂这批侵略者和剥削者吗？
    吴晗说：写了劳动人民革命斗争的历史，“历史上的光明面丧失了”，“历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的。”还说：“把我们的祖宗全说成是坏人”，“我们全是坏人的子孙”。这些话多么猖狂！我们告诉你：吴晗！不允许你混淆是非，颠倒黑白。你们所尊崇的祖宗是谁？是奴隶主、地主、资本家。我们的祖宗是被压迫、被剥削的劳动人民。劳动人民的革命斗争，就是历史的光明面，我们就是要大写劳动人民的斗争历史。只有写起了劳动人民的历史，我们劳动人民才会扬眉吐气！
