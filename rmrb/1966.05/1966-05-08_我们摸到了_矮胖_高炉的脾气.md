    We Figured Out the Temperament of the "Short and Stout" Blast Furnace
    Shi Gang No. 1 Blast Furnace Duty Room Team
    Respect Practice, Transform Mechanical Application into Original Creation
    Our iron smelting plant's No. 1 blast furnace is different from ordinary blast furnaces; it's a short and stout one. For over a hundred years, iron smelting blast furnaces have been tall and slender. This type of furnace has generally satisfied people for many years. However, on the road to the leaping advancement of blast furnace production, contradictions were exposed. The tall furnace makes it difficult for air to circulate smoothly inside the furnace, encountering difficulties in continuously accelerating the smelting of ore, and the output of iron is subject to certain limitations. Therefore, people made a revolution in furnace design, shortening the height of the blast furnace and thickening the body, changing the "tall and slender" into a "short and stout" one. After the short and stout blast furnace was put into operation, no one knew what kind of operating system would suit the new furnace's temperament at the beginning. The main problem at that time was what kind of charging system could maintain high yield, smooth operation, and low consumption. The foremen who came from No. 2 Blast Furnace, based on their experience with slender furnaces, believed that the batch of materials charged each time should be smaller to maintain the smooth operation of the furnace. The foremen from No. 3 Blast Furnace, based on their experience with large blast furnaces, advocated that the batch of materials should be larger, believing that this could save coke and increase output. Some comrades also collected technical data from foreign countries and several large blast furnaces in our country to prove that the fat furnace has a large furnace throat and can eat materials in large quantities. We did as the comrades of No. 3 Blast Furnace suggested, but it didn't work in production. So, we repeatedly compared the technical data of other furnaces with our own furnace. After such a comparison, many problems were discovered. We are a medium-sized blast furnace, while they are large blast furnaces; the foreign fat furnaces are conducting experiments with secondary materials, while we are industrial production, using refined materials. Only then did we truly realize that the mechanical application of learning methods is not feasible. Everyone clearly realized that to master the short and stout blast furnace, we must proceed from the actual situation of our own furnace and gradually explore experience in practice; even the successful experience of other furnaces must be transformed into our own experience through our own practice in order to master the short and stout blast furnace.
    When charging materials into the blast furnace, how much should be charged each time to be the most economical and reasonable? Everyone has different views based on their own experience. Although the debate is heated, everyone only appreciates their own opinions and does not respect the opinions of others, only valuing their own practical experience and not respecting the practical experience of others; even after experiencing the same practice, different conclusions can be drawn. After studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice," we realized that although everyone's experiences, opinions, and conclusions are all summarized from practice, they may not fully and correctly reflect objective reality, and these experiences must be proven correct through "re-practice." Therefore, we tested each blast furnace operation plan proposed by everyone in chronological order. We required each shift foreman to not only take their own plans seriously when testing them, but also to be meticulous, operate carefully, and summarize conscientiously when testing other people's plans. After testing these plans one by one, the results proved that too large a batch of materials would cause the furnace to be unsmooth, too small a batch of materials would not be economical, and using large and small batches together would not work either. Finally, a new plan was tested, called taking large batches of materials "as rice" and small batches of materials "as medicine." If the furnace is smooth, use larger batches of materials; if the furnace is not smooth, use small batches of materials to adjust. This not only ensures the stable and smooth operation of the furnace, but also achieves economy and rationality. The furnace situation has been very good, with output gradually increasing and coke consumption gradually decreasing.
                Dare to Practice, Turn Bad Things into Good Things
      Low-silicon iron is a relatively difficult new variety to smelt, and we have never smelted it before. However, after China's first set of large oxygen top-blown converters was put into production, it required blast furnaces to produce low-silicon iron. This kind of iron is very beneficial to the converter, which can shorten the steelmaking time, reduce the consumption of molten iron, and extend the life of the converter.
    We have always been afraid to smelt low-silicon iron in the past. Because the silicon content of pig iron is low, the furnace will be cold, and the smelting process is difficult to master. A slight fluctuation in the furnace condition will lead to accidents. Therefore, whenever we talk about smelting low-silicon iron, we get a "headache."
    The requirements of the converter are there. Are we going to be a stumbling block in the development of China's steelmaking industry, or are we going to be pioneers? Of course, we must be pioneers. However, we still lack sufficient confidence to really do it, and we still lack ways to overcome difficulties. The biggest obstacle is still the fear of cold furnace accidents. Therefore, we must find a way to subdue the cold furnace in order to smelt low-silicon iron. We also studied Chairman Mao's instructions on how the opposing sides of a contradiction can "transform each other" and how bad things can be turned into good things. Thinking about the fact that several cold furnaces in the past were bad things, how can we turn bad things into good things? We must first see how bad things are bad. Everyone comprehensively and specifically analyzed the reasons for several cold furnaces. The more we analyzed, the more confident we became, and the more methods we had. Later, we formulated fifteen operating measures to control the temperature of the furnace based on the characteristics of silicon reduction. The low-silicon iron smelting barrier was finally conquered by us. We not only smelted ordinary low-silicon iron that meets the needs of the converter, but also smelted ultra-low-silicon iron that can be used to smelt certain advanced alloy steels.
    From the practice of smelting low-silicon iron, we realized that respecting practice means not only respecting successful experience, but also respecting the lessons of failure. With successful experience and lessons of failure, such understanding is more complete and profound. At the same time, it also made us further realize that there are two attitudes and two methods to treat accidents and bad things. In the past, when we dealt with accidents on blast furnaces, we often only analyzed them technically, but not ideologically; we only analyzed the harmful consequences, but not how to learn from the lessons. As a result, the more we analyzed, the more afraid we became, and the more afraid we became, the more we shrank back and dared not do it. In this way, we were frightened by bad things, and the same accident was repeated again and again. With "fear" in the lead, bad things can never be turned into good things; with "dare" in the lead, bad things can be turned into good things.
                Be Good at Practice, Transform Necessity into Freedom
      Short and stout blast furnaces can blow more air and produce more iron, but their weakness is that the furnace body is short, the heat in the furnace is not fully utilized, and the consumption of coke is higher. In the case of insufficient coke, this adds new contradictions to producing more iron. Therefore, we decided to conduct experiments on injecting pulverized coal into the furnace at No. 1 Blast Furnace. Some countries have also done this method, but encountered many difficulties, and some furnaces formed tumors. What should we do? We are determined to take risks, not "eat ready-made meals," and take a path that foreign countries have not succeeded in.
      The task of our duty room is how to make the blast furnace eat pulverized coal, and the more the better, without causing indigestion. At the same time, we must also explore a set of rules for mastering coal injection operations and create a new way to use part of anthracite to replace coke for iron smelting. In the battle of injecting pulverized coal into the blast furnace, we quickly broke through one difficult barrier after another, so that the amount of pulverized coal injected continued to increase. In order to further increase the amount of pulverized coal injected into the blast furnace, we also widely mobilized the masses, implemented the "three-in-one combination" inside and outside, promoted technical democracy, and fully utilized the advantages of the short and stout blast furnace in operation. We blew more air into the blast furnace, increased the space and time for pulverized coal to burn in the blast furnace, so that the amount of pulverized coal injected into the blast furnace every day has increased again, and the production level of our blast furnace has reached a new level.
      From the work of pulverized coal injection into the blast furnace, we realized that roads are made by people, and conditions are created by people. Only those who dare to struggle and dare to win have the determination and perseverance to overcome difficulties. However, "infinite scenery is at the dangerous peak." The road to climb to the peak is rugged and bumpy. It must be those who dare to struggle and are good at struggling to reach the peak and transform necessity into freedom.

### 我们摸到了“矮胖”高炉的脾气

专栏：高炉上的辩证法

    我们摸到了“矮胖”高炉的脾气
    石钢一高炉值班室小组
    尊重实践，变生搬为独创
    我们炼铁厂的一号高炉，和一般高炉不一样，它是个矮胖子。一百多年来，炼铁的高炉都是又高又大的瘦高个儿，这种炉型，多年来人们一直比较满意。但是在高炉生产飞跃前进的道路上，矛盾暴露出来了。炉子高，炉膛里面透气就不那么痛快，不断加快矿石的熔炼就遇到了困难，铁的产量就受到了一定的限制。于是，人们在炉型上闹了一场革命，把高炉的高度改矮了，身腰加粗了，把“瘦高个儿”改成了“矮胖子”。矮胖高炉投产以后，用什么样操作制度才能适合新炉子的脾气，开头谁也摸不透。当时主要问题是用什么样的装料制度才能保持高产、顺行和消耗低。从二高炉来的工长们，根据掌握瘦高炉子的经验，认为每次装料的料批要小一些，才能保持炉子顺行。从三高炉来的工长们，根据大高炉的经验主张料批要大一些，认为这样，可以省焦炭，产量高。有的同志还收集了外国的和我们国家几个大型高炉的技术资料来证明，认为胖炉子炉喉大，可以大口吃料。我们照三高炉同志们的意见做了，一到生产上就行不通。于是又反复地将别的炉子的技术资料和自己的炉子相比。这样一比，发现许多问题。我们是中型高炉，人家是大型高炉；外国的胖炉是用次料搞试验，我们是工业生产，吃的是精料。这才真正认识到生搬硬套的学习方法是不行的，大家明确认识了要掌握好矮胖高炉，必须从自己炉子的实际情况出发，在实践中逐渐摸索经验；就是别的炉子成功的经验，也要经过自己的实践变成自己的经验，才能掌握好矮胖高炉。
    往高炉里装料，每次究竟应该装多少，才是最经济合理？我们每个人根据自己的经验，有不同的看法。虽然争论很热烈，但是，每个人只欣赏自己的意见，不大尊重别人的意见，只重视自己的实践经验，不尊重别人的实践经验；甚至经历了同样的实践，也会得出不同的结论。学习了毛主席的《实践论》，我们这才认识到：每个人的经验、意见和结论，虽然都是从实践里总结出来的，但是并不一定都能全面、正确地反映客观实际，必须通过“再实践”才能证明这些经验是否正确。于是，我们把每个人提出的高炉操作方案，按先后次序进行试验。要求每班工长不仅在试验自己方案的时候认真对待，而且在试验别人的方案时更要一丝不苟，细心操作，认真总结。经过这样一个个方案的试验，结果证明：料批过大，会造成炉子不顺，料批太小也不经济，还有大小料批一起用也不行。最后，试验出来了一个新方案，叫做拿大料批“当饭吃”、小料批“当药吃”，炉子顺就使用较大的料批，炉子不顺，就用小料批调剂。这样做，既保证了炉子的稳定顺行，又做到了经济合理。炉子的情况一直很好，产量逐步上升、焦炭消耗逐渐下降。
                勇于实践，变坏事为好事
      低硅铁是一种比较难炼的新品种，过去我们从来也没有炼过。但是，我国第一套大型氧气顶吹转炉投入生产以后，它要求高炉能生产低硅铁。这种铁对转炉好处很多，可以缩短炼钢时间，降低铁水消耗，延长转炉寿命。
    我们过去一直不敢炼低硅铁。因为生铁含硅低，炉子要冷，冶炼过程不好掌握，炉况稍一波动就要出事故。因此，一谈到炼低硅铁就“脑门疼”。
    转炉的要求摆在那里，我们是做我国炼钢事业发展上的绊脚石，还是当开路先锋？当然要做开路先锋。但是，真正去做还缺乏足够的信心，还缺少克服困难的办法，最大的障碍还是怕出现炉冷事故。因此必须想办法制服炉冷，才能炼出低硅铁来。我们又学习了毛主席关于矛盾着的对立的双方可以“互相转化”、坏事可以变成好事的指示。想到过去几次炉冷是坏事，怎样才能使坏事变成好事呢？必须先看看坏事是怎么坏的。大家全面具体地分析了几次炉冷的原因，越分析大家信心越足，越分析办法越多。后来我们根据硅还原的特点，制定了控制炉子温度的十五条操作措施，低硅铁冶炼关，终于被我们攻下了。我们不仅炼出了满足转炉用的普通低硅铁，而且也炼出了可以冶炼某些高级合金钢用的超低硅铁。
    从冶炼低硅铁的实践里，我们体会到：尊重实践，不仅要尊重成功的经验，而且更要尊重失败的教训。有成功的经验，
  又有失败的教训，这样的认识才更完整、更深刻。同时也使我们进一步认识到：对待事故，对待坏事，有两种态度，两种方法。我们过去对待高炉上出的事故，往往只从技术上分析，没
  有从思想上分析；只从危害后果上分析，没从如何接受教训分
  析。结果越分析越怕，越怕越缩手缩脚，越不敢干。这样被坏
  事吓破了胆，同样的事故一犯再犯。“怕”字当头，坏事永远也
  变不成好事，“敢”字当头，坏事才能变成好事。
                善于实践，变必然为自由
      矮胖高炉，能多吹风、多出铁，但它的弱点是炉身短，炉
  子里的热量利用不充分，焦炭的消耗高一些。在焦炭不足的情
  况下，这对多出铁又增加了新的矛盾。因此，我们决定在一高
  炉进行向炉内喷吹煤粉的试验。这种方法，有些国家也搞过，但
  遇到了重重困难，有的炉子结了瘤。我们怎么办？决心担风险，
  不“吃现成饭”，走外国没有成功的路子。
      我们值班室的任务就是怎样使高炉把煤粉吃到肚子里，而
  且吃得越多越好，而不会造成消化不良。同时还要摸索出一套
  掌握喷煤操作的规律，闯出一条使用部分无烟煤代替焦炭炼铁
  的新路来。我们在向高炉喷煤粉的战斗中，迅速地突破了一道
  又一道的难关，使煤粉的喷吹数量，不断增加。为了更进一步
  增加往高炉里喷吹煤粉的数量，我们还广泛发动群众，实行内
  外三结合，发扬技术民主，在操作上充分利用矮胖高炉的优越
  性，多往高炉里吹风，增加了煤粉在高炉里燃烧的空间和时
  间，使每天喷入高炉的煤粉量又有了增加，我们高炉的生产水
  平，又达到了一个新的水平。
      从高炉喷煤粉的工作中，我们体会到：路是人走出来的、条
  件是人创造的，只有敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人才有克服困难的
  决心和毅力。但是“无限风光在险峰”，攀登顶峰的路是崎岖坎
  坷的，必须是敢于斗争，善于斗争的人，才能到达顶峰，变必
  然为自由。
