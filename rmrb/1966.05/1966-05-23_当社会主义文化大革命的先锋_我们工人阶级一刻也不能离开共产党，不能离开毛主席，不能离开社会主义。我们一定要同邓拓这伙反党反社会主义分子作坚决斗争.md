    Being a Vanguard of the Socialist Cultural Revolution
    We of the Working Class Cannot Leave the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, or Socialism for a Moment. We Must Wage a Resolute Struggle Against the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Elements of Deng Tuo and His Ilk
    Zhang Ruiying, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Threading Worker, Zhenxin Textile Factory, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province
    Deng Tuo slanders our Party as "being clever, looking down on the masses," slanders our Party for "not cherishing labor power" during the Great Leap Forward, and even arrogantly clamors for our Party to step down and "rest" quickly, wanting to strike our Party dead with one blow. These anti-Party, anti-people black words have aroused great indignation in us, the working class. Deng Tuo, listen, this is your wishful thinking, it can never be done. Historical facts and life experiences tell us: the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the great saviors of the Chinese people, the red sun in our hearts. We of the working class cannot leave the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, or socialism for a moment. We of the working class have already made this determination.
    Before liberation, we textile workers lived lives worse than cattle and horses. I entered the factory as a child laborer at the age of eleven, working from before dawn until the middle of the night, never seeing the sun all year round, and becoming as thin as skin and bones. Entering the workshop was like entering a prison, and leaving the factory gate required a "gate pass." In the sweltering heat, the workshop was as hot as a steamer, and people often fainted in the workshop. Our class sister, Yang Mandi, died of heatstroke next to a machine before liberation. In the old society, the working class had no right to speak at all; even if you spoke, it was in vain. Only after liberation, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, did the working class stand up and become masters of the country. Now, workers have labor protection systems, and birth, old age, sickness, and death are all guaranteed. In the old society, workers could not get a single pill from the capitalists even when they were dying. In the new society, injections, medicine, hospitalization, and surgery do not cost us workers a single penny. Take me, an ordinary female worker who was looked down upon in the old society, for example. After liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, I did some things that I should have done, and the Party and the people gave me great honor, electing me as a labor model and people's representative of the city, province, and the whole country several times. In 1964, I attended the First Session of the Third National People's Congress and discussed state affairs with national leaders in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In addition to me, there were many ordinary laborers such as sanitation workers, barbers, and salespersons who were trampled underfoot in the old society among the representatives. Whenever I think of this, I will laugh in my sleep. Don't the above facts eloquently illustrate that the Party and Chairman Mao are our great saviors, and that our Party cares for and cherishes the masses the most?
    Deng Tuo's delusion to overthrow the leadership of the Party is absolutely intolerable. We of the working class must not only be vanguards in the struggle for production, but also vanguards in this Great Cultural Revolution struggle, and wage a resolute struggle against the anti-Party, anti-socialist elements of Deng Tuo and his ilk. We will never withdraw our troops until we have won a complete victory.

    当社会主义文化大革命的先锋
    我们工人阶级一刻也不能离开共产党，不能离开毛主席，不能离开社会主义。我们一定要同邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子作坚决斗争
    全国人民代表大会代表江苏省无锡振新纺织厂穿筘工  章瑞英
    邓拓诬蔑我们的党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，诬蔑我们的党在大跃进中“不爱护劳动力”，甚至狂妄地叫嚣要我们党赶快下台“休息”，要把我们党一棍子打死。这些反党反人民的黑话，激起了我们工人阶级极大愤恨。邓拓，你听着，这是你们的痴心妄想，是万万办不到的。历史事实和生活经验告诉我们：共产党和毛主席，是中国人民的大救星，是我们心中的红太阳。我们工人阶级一时一刻不能离开共产党，不能离开毛主席，不能离开社会主义。我们工人阶级的这个决心早已下定了。
    解放前，我们纺织女工过着牛马不如的生活。我十一岁就进厂做童工，从天不亮做到半夜里，成年累月见不到太阳，人瘦得皮包骨头。进车间就象进监牢，出厂门还得“开门票”。大伏天，车间热得象蒸笼，经常有人昏倒在车间。我们的阶级姐妹杨满娣，解放前就是中了暑死在机器旁的。旧社会，工人阶级根本没有说话的权利，即使你说了，也是白说。只有在解放后，在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，工人阶级才翻了身，当了国家的主人。现在，工人有了劳动保护制度，生、老、病、死都有了保障。旧社会工人病得快死了，也吃不到资本家的一颗药片。新社会，打针吃药、住院、开刀，都用不到我们工人自己掏一分钱。再拿我这个在旧社会被人看不起的普通女工来说，解放后在党的培养下，做了一些我应该做的事，党和人民就给了我很大的荣誉，几次选我为市、省、全国的劳动模范和人民代表。一九六四年我出席了第三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，在北京人民大会堂和国家领导人一起商议国家大事。代表中除了我以外，还有许多在旧社会被人踩在脚底下的清洁工、理发师、营业员等普通劳动者。每当我想起这件事，从睡梦里也会笑醒过来。以上事实，不是雄辩地说明了党和毛主席是我们的大救星，我们党最关心、最爱护群众吗？
    邓拓妄想推翻党的领导，这是绝对不能容忍的。我们工人阶级不仅要在生产斗争中当急先锋，而且要在这场文化大革命斗争中当急先锋，同邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义分子作坚决的斗争。不获全胜，决不收兵。
