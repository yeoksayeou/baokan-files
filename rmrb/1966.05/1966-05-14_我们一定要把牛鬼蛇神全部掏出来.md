    We Must Dig Out All the Cow Demons and Snake Spirits
    Deng Tuo and his gang's attempt to sow discord between the Party and the masses is a blind and misguided effort. We, the working people, have always closely followed the Party and Chairman Mao.
    Shi Chuanxiang, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Sanitation Worker, Chongwen District, Beijing

    Deng Tuo and a small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements viciously curse our Party and attack our Party, saying that our Party is "self-righteous and looks down on the masses." This is a malicious slander against the Party. Our Party has always believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and considered the people to be the true heroes and masters of history. Only those reactionaries, landlords, capitalists, and your gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements look down on the masses and the people.

    We night soil collectors were called "dung beetles" and "stinky dung eggs" in the old society, living lives worse than animals. Bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalists could beat and scold us at will, not treating us as human beings at all. After liberation, we working people stood up, became masters of our own affairs, and took control of the state power. We night soil collectors also participate in managing the affairs of the country. I was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress and sat with our national leaders to discuss national affairs. In 1959, I attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi received me, shook my hand, and talked to me. An ordinary night soil collector, able to sit in the Great Hall of the People to discuss state affairs, able to shake hands and converse intimately with our national leaders – this is something that has never happened in history. Only under the leadership and care of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao could we have today, could we become masters of the country, and could we eliminate the enemies riding on our heads. Isn't this an ironclad fact?

    However, Deng Tuo and his ilk turn black into white, slander our Party for looking down on the masses. This is to sow discord between the Party and the masses, and to incite the masses to rise up against our great Party. You are blind and have chosen the wrong path. We working people have always had a red heart towards the Party, and we will always closely follow the Party and Chairman Mao. You eat the food of the working people and drink the water of the working people, yet you are engaged in anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist activities. You want to dismantle the socialist stage; this cannot be done. Our working class, peasant class, and the masses of people throughout the country will resolutely defend our Party and defend our socialism!

    What is particularly infuriating is that *Qianxian* and the *Beijing Ribao* are giving Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements sham criticism and real cover, wanting to protect them so they can get through this. The eyes of us workers are sharp and clear. No matter what tricks you play, we will use our dung scoops to dig out you cow demons and snake spirits. Your editorial department stubbornly stands on the bourgeois position, engaging in anti-Party, anti-socialist activities together with Deng Tuo and them. We will resolutely fight you to the end, and we will never stop until we achieve complete victory.

    我们一定要把牛鬼蛇神全部掏出来
    邓拓一伙妄图挑拨党和群众的关系，这是瞎了眼，认错了门路。我们劳动人民从来都紧紧跟随着党和毛主席
    全国人民代表大会代表、北京崇文区清洁工人　时传祥
    邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子，恶毒地咒骂我们党，攻击我们党，说我们党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，这是对党的恶毒诬蔑。我们的党，从来就是相信群众，依靠群众，认为人民群众是真正的英雄，是历史的主人。只有那些反动派、地主、资本家和你们这一伙反党反社会主义分子才看不起群众，看不起人民。
    我们掏粪工人在旧社会被人叫做屎克郎、臭屎蛋，过着牛马不如的生活。官僚、地主、资本家可以随便打骂，根本不拿我们当人。解放后，我们劳动人民翻了身，当家做了主人，掌握了国家政权，我们掏粪工人也参加管理国家大事。我当选为全国人民代表大会代表，和我们的国家领导人坐在一起商议国家大事。一九五九年，我出席了全国先进生产者代表大会，刘少奇主席接见了我，和我握手、谈话。一个普通的掏粪工人，能够坐在人民大会堂里议论国事，能够和我们国家的领导人亲切地握手、交谈，这是历史上从来没有过的。只有在共产党、毛主席的领导、关怀下，我们才会有今天，才能够成为国家的主人，才消灭了骑在我们头上的敌人，这不是铁的事实吗？
    可是，邓拓之流却颠倒黑白，诬蔑我们党看不起群众，这是挑拨党和群众的关系，是煽动群众起来反对我们伟大的党。你们瞎了眼，认错了门路，我们劳动人民从来就是一颗红心向着党，任何时候，都要紧紧跟随着党和毛主席。你们吃的是劳动人民的，喝的是劳动人民的，却干着反党反人民反社会主义的勾当。你们想拆社会主义的台，这是办不到的，我们工人阶级、农民阶级、全国人民群众都坚决保卫我们的党，保卫我们的社会主义！
    特别叫人气愤的是，《前线》、《北京日报》对邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义分子，假批判，真掩护，想保他们过关。我们工人的眼睛是雪亮的，不管你们耍什么花招，我们也要把你们这些牛鬼蛇神用粪勺子掏出来。你们编辑部顽强地站在资产阶级立场，和邓拓他们一起干反党反社会主义的勾当，我们要坚决和你们斗争到底，不彻底胜利，决不收兵。
