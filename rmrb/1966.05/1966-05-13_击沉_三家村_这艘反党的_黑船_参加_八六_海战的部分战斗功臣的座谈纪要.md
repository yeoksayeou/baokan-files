    A recent symposium was held with meritorious personnel who participated in the "August 6th" Naval Battle to vehemently denounce the crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang in opposing the Party and socialism.

    First-Class Meritorious Person, Soldier Han Jie: Deng Tuo viciously attacked our Party, demanding that the Party "rest completely, say nothing, do nothing," and abandon leadership. This is to drag us back to the cannibalistic old society. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without Chairman Mao's leadership, there would be no days of liberation for us working people. Before liberation, my father worked for the landlord and was tortured to death. My mother raised our family of ten, eating chaff and wild herbs every day. I never wore a complete piece of clothing. At that time, the Kuomintang grabbed men for conscription everywhere. When my elder brother hid to avoid conscription, the township head imprisoned my mother. If it weren't for liberation, if Chairman Mao hadn't come, we poor people wouldn't have today. Now the anti-Party element Deng Tuo comes out to demand that the Party "rest completely," so that modern revisionism can thoroughly betray the world revolution, and let American imperialism and Soviet revisionism dominate the world. We revolutionary soldiers will never agree to this.

    Second-Class Meritorious Person, Signalman Zou Shimin: Deng Tuo slandered our Party for "talking empty words" and using "clichés," wanting us not to listen to Chairman Mao. This is absolutely impossible. Chairman Mao's words have the highest prestige and the greatest power, possessing unparalleled strength in our hearts. Take last year's "August 6th" Naval Battle. Our small craft sank the American-made Chiang gang's warships "Zhangjiang" and "Jianmen," which were five or six times larger than us. Although most comrades were participating in naval battle for the first time, the moment we thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, we were filled with infinite power, fearing nothing. Seeing the Chairman Mao's quotations plaque at our battle stations felt like Chairman Mao was right beside us, directing us in battle. Many comrades fought on despite minor injuries, and bore the pain without complaint despite severe injuries. Combat hero Mai Xiande, despite suffering a serious head wound, still stood up like an iron man, endured, and insisted on fighting for three hours until the final victory. His squad leader, Comrade Huang Rusheng, suffered forty-seven wounds, and continued operating the machinery with one hand holding his wounds, persisting until the victorious return.

    Mai Xiande's Squad Leader, First-Class Meritorious Person Huang Rusheng: Deng Tuo wants us not to listen to Chairman Mao; that's impossible! For those of us who suffered deep oppression in the past, sons and daughters of workers and peasants, if we don't listen to Chairman Mao, who should we listen to? In our experience of deeply suffering class and national oppression, in our heroic battles to kill the enemy, we deeply realized that only by listening to Chairman Mao's words and arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought can we defeat the enemy, liberate ourselves, and liberate all of mankind. Combat hero Mai Xiande, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, closely linked his family's suffering with class suffering, understood that family hatred must be avenged, and class hatred even more so, established a proletarian world view, and resolved to "knock down Huang Shiren with one shot, knock down Chiang Kai-shek with two shots, knock down the American devils with three shots, and knock down all the lackeys with four shots." Therefore, he demonstrated the greatest courage and the toughest backbone in the "August 6th" Naval Battle.

    Second-Class Meritorious Person, Machinist Qian Hongye: The great Party and Chairman Mao trust us, the masses, the most, look highly upon the masses the most, and are the best at listening to the opinions of the masses. Our unit's Party committee and leaders follow Chairman Mao's teachings, earnestly carry forward the excellent traditions of the Three Great Democracies, and are absolutely not "fond of showing off their abilities" or "look down upon the masses" as Deng Tuo slanders. Last year's "August 6th" Naval Battle, when we received the order to attack, time was extremely tight, but the leaders still seized every bit of time before setting sail to hand the battle plan over to us sailors for discussion. The commander adopted our suggestions, enabling our flotilla to quickly pass through the reef area and achieve complete victory in the battle. After the battle, the leaders even asked us sailors for suggestions and to identify shortcomings. Deng Tuo wants to sow discord between us and the Party; he won't get any benefits here. We workers, peasants, and soldiers will never fall for your tricks!

    Zou Shimin: Deng Tuo vehemently cursed our great Party and leader for being "self-righteous" and "looking down on the masses." We want to question Deng Tuo: you oppose the Party and socialism, singing the same tune as right-leaning opportunists, wanting to engage in capitalist restoration in China. How can we regard you as the masses? Our Party didn't listen to your opinions; that was the right thing to do. If we had listened to your words and acted according to your words, then the entire China would change color, and the Chinese people would suffer.

    Huang Rusheng: Deng Tuo attacked our national economic plan, saying it was "daydreaming," "replacing reality with fantasy." This is completely opening his eyes and talking nonsense! We naval fighters have the deepest understanding of the socialist economic construction plan put forward by the Party. After only a few short years, we are now burning fuel produced by our own country on our boats, and we are driving warships manufactured by our own country. This is a miracle that has never happened in our country's history.

    Second-Class Meritorious Person, Engine Squad Leader Chen Langxin, Third-Class Meritorious Person, Signalman Jiang Yongliang: In the "August 6th" Naval Battle, the enemy holding guns didn't listen to our warnings, and delusional about relying on their large ships and big guns, frantically attacked us with long-range artillery. When we concentrated our forces to annihilate the "Zhangjiang," the "Jianmen" provided artillery cover from the side. After our flotilla sank the "Zhangjiang," it pursued the victory and pursued and attacked "Jianmen," scoring a brilliant sea annihilation battle. Deng Tuo, this small group of enemies who don't hold guns, just as domestic and foreign class enemies were stepping up their attacks on us, thought their time had come, gleefully and eagerly, relying on some kind of "authority," also attacked us. But their wishful thinking was wrong. We will defeat them just like we defeated the enemies holding guns!

    击沉“三家村”这艘反党的“黑船”
    ——参加“八六”海战的部分战斗功臣的座谈纪要
    参加“八六”海战的部分有功人员，最近举行了座谈，痛斥邓拓这一伙人反党反社会主义的罪行。
    一等功臣、战士韩杰：邓拓恶毒地攻击我们党，要党“完全休息，什么话也不要说，什么事也不要做”，要党放弃领导，这是要把我们拖回到吃人的旧社会去。没有共产党就没有新中国，没有毛主席的领导，就没有我们劳动人民翻身的日子。解放前我父亲给地主扛活，活活被折磨死了，我母亲带着我们一家十口，整天吃糠咽菜，我身上从来没有穿过一件完整的衣服。那时国民党到处抓壮丁，我大哥躲壮丁，乡保长就把我母亲关起来。要不是解放了，毛主席来了，我们穷人就不会有今天。现在反党分子邓拓跑出来要党“完全休息”，好让现代修正主义彻底出卖世界革命，让美帝国主义和苏联修正主义来主宰世界，我们革命战士决不答应。
    二等功臣、信号兵邹世民：邓拓污蔑我们党“说空话”“陈词滥调”，要我们不听毛主席的话，这绝对办不到。毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，在我们心中有着无比的力量。就说去年“八六”海战吧，我们的小艇击沉了比我们大五六倍的美制蒋帮军舰“章江号”和“剑门号”。在这次海战中尽管大部分同志都是初次参加海战，但一想起毛主席的教导，浑身就增添了无穷的力量，什么也不怕，在战位上看到毛主席语录牌，觉得象毛主席就在我们身旁，指挥我们战斗一样。不少同志做到轻伤不下火线，重伤不叫苦。战斗英雄麦贤得头部负重伤，仍然象铁人一样地站起来，挺得住，坚持战斗三小时，直到最后胜利。他的班长黄汝省同志身受四十七处伤，一手抚着伤口，一手操纵机器，一直坚持到胜利返航。
    麦贤得的班长、一等功臣黄汝省：邓拓要我们不听毛主席的话，这办不到！象我们过去深受压迫的工农子弟，不听毛主席的话，听谁的话？在我们深受阶级苦、民族苦的经历中，在我们英勇杀敌的战斗中，我们深深地体会到只有听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，才能战胜敌人，解放自己，解放全人类。战斗英雄麦贤得，就是根据毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，把家庭苦和阶级苦紧紧联系在一起，懂得了家仇要报，阶级仇更要报，树立了无产阶级世界观，他决心“一枪撂倒黄世仁，二枪撂倒蒋光头，三枪撂倒美国鬼，四枪撂倒众走狗”。因此，他在“八六”海战中表现了最大的勇敢，最硬的骨头。
    二等功臣、轮机兵钱宏业：伟大的党和毛主席最相信我们群众，最看得起群众，最善于听取群众意见。我们部队党委和首长遵循毛主席教导，认真发扬三大民主的优良传统，根本不象邓拓所污蔑的是“喜欢自己逞能”，“看不起群众”。去年“八六”海战，当接到出击的命令后，时间十分紧迫，但领导上还是抓紧出海前的点滴时间，把作战方案交给我们水兵讨论。指挥员采纳了我们的意见，使我艇队迅速地通过暗礁区，并且取得了战斗的完全胜利。战斗结束后，领导上还叫我们水兵提意见，找缺点。邓拓想挑拨我们和党的关系，在这里是捞不到油水的，我们工农兵决不会上你们的当！
    邹世民：邓拓大肆咒骂我们伟大的党和领袖是“自作聪明”，“看不起群众”。我们要质问邓拓，你们反党反社会主义，跟右倾机会主义分子一鼻孔出气，想在中国搞资本主义复辟，我们怎么能把你们当成群众呢？我们党没有听你们的意见，那是做对了。如果听了你们的话，照你们的话去办，那么整个中国就要改变颜色，中国人民就要遭殃。
    黄汝省：邓拓攻击我们的国民经济计划，说什么“想入非非”，“用空想代替现实”，这完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话！我们海军战士，对党提出的社会主义经济建设计划体会得最深刻。经过短短的几年工夫，现在我们艇上烧的是自己国家生产的燃料，我们驾驶着自己国家制造的军舰，这是我国历史上从来没有过的奇迹。
    二等功臣、轮机班长陈朗新、三等功臣、信号兵蒋永亮：在“八六”海战中，拿枪的敌人不听我们警告，妄想凭借什么舰大、炮大，疯狂地用远射程炮向我们攻击。当我们集中力量歼灭“章江号”的时候，“剑门号”在一旁炮火掩护。我艇队击沉了“章江号”后，又乘胜追击，腰斩“剑门”，打了一个漂亮的海上歼灭战。邓拓这一小撮不拿枪的敌人，正当国内外阶级敌人加紧向我们进攻的时期，就认为时机到了，欣喜欲狂、摩拳擦掌，凭借什么“权威”，也向我们进攻。但是他们的如意算盘打错了，我们也要象打败拿枪的敌人一样，把他们打败！
