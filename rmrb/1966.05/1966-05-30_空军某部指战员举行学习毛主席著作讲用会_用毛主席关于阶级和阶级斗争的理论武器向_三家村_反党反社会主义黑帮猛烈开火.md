    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th -- Cadres and soldiers of an Air Force unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently held a meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. At the meeting, everyone used Chairman Mao's theory of class and class struggle as a weapon, fiercely opened fire on the "Three-Family Village" black shop, and further grasped Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle.

    One Must Never Forget Class Struggle

    Deputy Section Chief Liu Bingru said: In this class struggle, reviewing Chairman Mao's "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China" feels very cordial, as if Chairman Mao is standing in front of us, personally directing us to fight, full of energy, fighting more and more bravely. Chairman Mao taught us: "The large-scale, rapid and stormy mass class struggles of our domestic revolutionary period have basically ended, but there are still class struggles, mainly class struggles on the political and ideological fronts, and they are still very sharp." This is exactly the case. The "Three-Family Village" black gang used talking about history, imparting knowledge, telling stories, and making jokes as a guise to frantically attack the Party and socialism. What kind of evaluation of historical figures is this? What kind of academic issue is this? It is clearly a life-and-death class struggle. With Mao Zedong Thought as our "demon-revealing mirror," all monsters and demons, no matter what hidden and cunning methods they adopt, will be exposed in broad daylight. Their conspiracy to restore capitalism will never succeed!

    Platoon Leader Zhang Fuge said: Chairman Mao said that intellectuals who hold hostile sentiments towards our country "dislike our proletarian dictatorship state and miss the old society. Given the opportunity, they will stir up trouble, wanting to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." In the sixteen years since liberation, class struggle on the cultural front has never stopped for a day. For example, the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the criticism of "Studies of *Dream of the Red Chamber*," the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the current socialist cultural revolution, etc., all show that anti-Party and anti-socialist elements always stubbornly express their bourgeois nature. Every time their black wind blows, it is immediately exposed and criticized by the broad masses. However, their evil hearts will not die, and they continue to change their tricks and continue to attack the Party and socialism, again and again, truly making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until their destruction. The current handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are all devils wearing "painted skins." They wave "red flags" to oppose the red flag, use their power to control some units and propaganda tools, and vainly attempt to use their pens to seize what they cannot seize with guns. The class enemy vainly attempts to move our foundation and drag us back to the old society, which is absolutely impossible! From this, I deeply realize that class struggle in the socialist period is long-term, tortuous, and complex. We must never forget class struggle for a moment.

    Eradicate the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Line on the Cultural Front

    Staff Officer Dong Zhihong said: In the past, I felt that for more than ten years since liberation, the socialist economic base and the proletarian dictatorship in our country had been consolidated. In this class struggle, I realized that there is a black line in the cultural field that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. They write black articles, publish black books, say black words, perform black dramas, and shoot black movies to promote bourgeois and revisionist culture, paving the way for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. Without achieving victory in the socialist revolution in the ideological field, the socialist revolution on the economic front cannot be consolidated. As Chairman Mao taught us, in the socialist period, "the issue of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in ideology has not yet been truly resolved," and "ideological issues have now become very important issues." Social existence determines social consciousness, and at the same time, social consciousness has a counter-effect on social existence. Any counter-revolutionary restoration first grasps ideology, creating public opinion for itself from the aspects of theory, academia, and literature and art. This is how Khrushchev revisionism usurped the leadership of the CPSU, and this is also how the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956 occurred. Currently, isn't a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements pulling black lines and hanging black flags, attempting to open a gap from the cultural front and restore capitalism? If we think they are "scholars rebelling" and relax our vigilance and struggle against them, it will not be long before China changes color. We must be like charging into battle on the battlefield, and we must also fight every inch of ground in the cultural battle line against bourgeois ideology, completely eliminate the black line, and firmly occupy the cultural position!

    Clerk Kong Weiqin said: Deng Tuo and his gang are enemies without guns, and they are more insidious and vicious than enemies with guns. They vainly attempt to make people unknowingly become poisoned, be fooled, and follow them. Our army does not live in a vacuum, and class struggle in society must be reflected in the army; and our People's Liberation Army is the main tool of the proletarian dictatorship, and the enemy always tries every means to sabotage our army and corrupt it through literature, art, theory, and other channels. If we relax our vigilance, bourgeois ideology will take advantage of the situation. Therefore, we must follow the instructions of the Military Commission and Comrade Lin Biao, never forget class struggle, never forget the proletarian dictatorship, never forget to highlight politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Learn the Ability to Fight Against Enemies Without Guns

    Liu Bingru said: Class enemies always adopt the form of violence and the form of "peaceful evolution" to carry out capitalist restoration, or the two forms cooperate with each other. Therefore, our soldiers with guns must not only be good at fighting enemies with guns, but also learn to fight enemies without guns. At the beginning of this class struggle, the monsters and demons of the "Three-Family Village" black gang put on the airs of "scholars" and "authorities," saying that one is not qualified to speak without reading the entire "Twenty-Four Histories." At that time, they really intimidated us for a while, and we felt that we couldn't use our strength. However, Chairman Mao taught us: Only in class struggle can we truly learn Marxism, and we can "distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds only through comparison." When we compared Chairman Mao's words with the black words of the "Three-Family Village," the reactionary faces of Deng Tuo and his gang were exposed. So, we bravely plunged into the struggle to eradicate the poisonous weeds. From this, we deeply realized that those so-called "authorities" are nothing great! As long as our revolutionary fighters listen to Chairman Mao's words, no matter what monsters and demons they are, we can defeat them thoroughly!

    Deputy Section Chief He Huxiang said: Chairman Mao taught us: "There are many things we don't know, so we can't solve them. In debate and struggle, we will understand these things and learn how to solve problems." In the past, we learned warfare from war and defeated the Japanese devils, Chiang Kai-shek, and American imperialism. Our air force has also grown up in the struggle against the enemy. Whether the enemy comes from high altitude or low altitude, whether it comes during the day or at night, whether it is manned or unmanned, it cannot escape our punishment. Today, we must master the ability to fight enemies without guns in this class struggle. To do revolution for a lifetime is to fight against monsters and demons for a lifetime, and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end!

### 空军某部指战员举行学习毛主席著作讲用会  用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论武器向“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮猛烈开火

    空军某部指战员举行学习毛主席著作讲用会
    用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论武器向“三家村”反党反社会主义黑帮猛烈开火
    新华社二十九日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部干部和战士，最近开了一次学习毛主席著作的讲用会。会上，大家以毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争的理论为武器，猛烈向“三家村”黑店开火，在斗争中进一步掌握毛泽东思想。
    一刻也不能忘记阶级斗争
    副科长刘炳如说：在这场阶级斗争中，重温了毛主席的《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》，感到非常亲切，就象毛主席站在我们跟前，亲自指挥我们作战一样，浑身是劲，越斗越勇。毛主席教导说：“我们国内革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是还有阶级斗争，主要是政治战线上和思想战线上的阶级斗争，而且还很尖锐。”事实正是这样，“三家村”黑帮以谈历史、传知识、讲故事、说笑话为幌子，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，这那里是什么对历史人物评价问题，那里是什么学术问题呢？分明是你死我活的阶级斗争。我们有了毛泽东思想这个“照妖镜”，一切牛鬼蛇神，不管他们采取多么隐蔽、狡猾的手法，都将暴露在光天化日之下，他们搞资本主义复辟的阴谋，休想得逞！
    排长张福阁说：毛主席说，对于我们的国家抱敌对情绪的知识分子，“不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”解放十六年来，文化战线上的阶级斗争，一天也没有停止过。例如，对电影《武训传》的批判，对《〈红楼梦〉研究》的批判，对胡风反革命集团的斗争，反右派斗争，以及现在进行的社会主义文化大革命等等，都说明反党反社会主义分子，总是要顽强地表现他们的资产阶级本性的。每次他们的黑风一刮，就立刻遭到广大群众的揭露和批判。但是，他们的贼心是不死的，仍不断地变换花招，继续向党向社会主义进攻，一次又一次，真是捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡。当前这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，都是披着“画皮”的魔鬼。他们打着“红旗”反红旗，利用职权把持了一些单位和宣传工具，妄想用笔杆子夺取枪杆子夺不到的东西。阶级敌人妄想动我们的命根子，把我们拉回旧社会去，这绝对办不到！从这里我深深认识到，社会主义时期的阶级斗争是长期的、曲折的、复杂的。我们一刻也不能忘记阶级斗争。
    铲除文化战线上的反党反社会主义黑线
    参谋董志宏说：过去，我觉得解放十多年了，我国社会主义的经济基础和无产阶级专政已经巩固了。在这场阶级斗争中，才看清了在文化领域里存在着一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线。他们通过写黑文、出黑书、说黑话、演黑剧、拍黑电影，宣扬资产阶级、修正主义的文化，为资产阶级的复辟鸣锣开道。不取得意识形态领域里的社会主义革命的胜利，经济战线上的社会主义革命也就不能巩固。正如毛主席教导我们的，在社会主义时期，“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决”，“思想问题现在已经成为非常重要的问题”。社会存在决定社会意识，同时，社会意识对于社会存在又起着反作用。任何反革命复辟，都是先抓意识形态，从理论、学术、文艺等方面，为自己制造舆论。赫鲁晓夫修正主义篡夺苏共领导权是这样，一九五六年匈牙利的反革命叛乱也是这样。当前，一小撮反党反社会主义分子，拉黑线，挂黑旗，不也是企图从文化战线上打开缺口，复辟资本主义吗？如果认为他们是“秀才造反”，放松了对他们的警惕和斗争，不要多久，中国就会改变颜色。我们一定要象在战场上冲锋陷阵一样，在文化战线上也要和资产阶级思想寸土必争，彻底搞掉黑线，牢牢地占领文化阵地！
    干事孔维勤说：邓拓一伙人就是不拿枪的敌人，他们比拿枪的敌人更阴险，更毒辣。他们妄想使人们在不知不觉之中，中毒、上当，跟着他们跑。我们军队不是生活在真空里，社会上的阶级斗争一定要反映到军队中来；而且我们人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的主要工具，敌人总是想千方百计地对我军进行破坏，通过文艺、理论等途径对我军进行腐蚀。如果我们放松了警惕，资产阶级思想就会乘虚而入。因此，我们一定要遵照军委和林彪同志的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    学会同不拿枪的敌人作斗争的本领
    刘炳如说：阶级敌人搞资本主义复辟，总是要采取暴力的形式和“和平演变”的形式，或者两种形式互相配合。因此，我们拿枪的战士不但要善于和拿枪的敌人作斗争，也要学会和不拿枪的敌人作斗争。这场阶级斗争刚开始的时候，“三家村”黑帮的牛鬼蛇神摆出一副“学者”、“权威”的架势，说什么不读完“二十四史”就没有资格发言。当时，还真叫他们唬了一下子，觉得有劲使不上。可是，毛主席教导我们：在阶级斗争中才能真正学到马克思主义，对香花毒草“有比较才能鉴别”。我们用毛主席的话和“三家村”的黑话一比较，邓拓一伙的反动面目就暴露无遗了。于是，我们勇敢地投入了铲除毒草的斗争。从这里我们深深体会到，那些所谓“权威”，没什么了不起！我们革命战士，只要听毛主席的话，无论什么牛鬼蛇神，都能把他们打得落花流水！
    副科长何虎祥说：毛主席教导我们：“有许多事情我们不知道，因此不会解决，在辩论中间，在斗争中间，我们就会明了这些事情，就会懂得解决问题的方法。”过去，我们是从战争中学习战争，打败了日本鬼子、蒋介石和美帝国主义。我们空军也是在对敌斗争中成长起来的。敌人不管是高空来还是低空来，不管是白天来还是黑夜来，不管是有人驾驶还是无人驾驶，都逃不脱我们的惩罚。今天，我们就要在这场阶级斗争中掌握和不拿枪的敌人作斗争的本领。干一辈子革命，就和牛鬼蛇神斗一辈子，坚决把革命进行到底！
