    The Flowers of Revolutionary Comradeship Blossom
    In Albania, wherever you go, you can see signs symbolizing the profound friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples.
    When we strolled through Tirana and visited other cities or rural areas, we were often surrounded by groups of innocent and lively children. They rushed forward to shake hands with us, and some greeted us in the Chinese they had just learned. When you drive on the highway, you can also see large-character slogans made of stone: "Long Live the Communist Party of China!"
  "Long Live Sino-Albanian Friendship!" Whenever we attended mass rallies of Sino-Albanian friendship, we always heard the slogans and cheers of "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Friendship is the Guarantee."
    These days, while the Albanian Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Mehmet Shehu is visiting China, the Albanian people are all beaming with joy, symbolizing the increasingly vigorous blossoming of the flowers of revolutionary and militant friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples.
    Every day, Albanian newspapers and radio stations publish a large number of news items, commentaries, special features, and pictures about the visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation to China. These newspapers and radio reports reported on the extremely warm welcome received by the Albanian Party and government delegation in China, and enthusiastically introduced to the Albanian people the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction, as well as the significant victories achieved in the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.
    The speeches of Chinese leaders such as Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai and Comrade Shehu and Comrade Kabo at various rallies are the central topics of discussion among people from all walks of life in Albania. Many people said that these speeches are a huge blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, and a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world and the Albanian people.
    The news of the enthusiastic welcome of one million people in Beijing to the Albanian Party and government delegation has become a good story in the history of friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples. Many primary school students in Tirana happily shout "One million people!" when they see Chinese people.
    The militant friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples forged in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism is higher than mountains and deeper than the sea. It is as pure as crystal and as clear as mountain springs. The flowers of Sino-Albanian friendship are blooming everywhere, and they are blooming so beautifully and brightly.
    In order to express the profound friendship of the Albanian people towards the Chinese people and their love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, there are ten agricultural cooperatives in rural Albania named after "Mao Zedong," "Sino-Albanian Friendship," and "New China." Staff members of the Chinese Embassy in Albania and Chinese experts often go to the "Mao Zedong" Agricultural Cooperative in Lushnjë District and the "New China" Agricultural Cooperative in Tirana District to participate in labor. A huge textile complex under construction is also named the "Mao Zedong" Textile Complex. At the construction site of the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant, Chinese and Albanian experts and workers have formed the "Sino-Albanian Friendship Class." Textile workers at the "Stalin" Textile Complex in Tirana have established the "Sino-Albanian Friendship Production Team" and the "Lei Feng Production Team." The Migjeni and Hasan Vogli schools in Tirana have established the "Liu Hulan Class" and the "Sino-Albanian Friendship Class" respectively. Forty-six young pioneers from the Emin Duraku Eight-Year School in Tirana, after reading "Lei Feng's Diary" and watching the film "The Great Soldier Lei Feng," named their Young Pioneers squadron the "Lei Feng Squadron." The children unanimously expressed that they would be the Lei Fengs of Albania.
    The Chinese and Albanian peoples always learn from each other and help each other in socialist construction. In Durrës - "Port of Sino-Albanian Friendship," we saw ten-thousand-ton freighters loaded with Albanian materials setting sail for China. The ten thousand olive saplings that the Albanian government presented to China two years ago were shipped from this "Port of Sino-Albanian Friendship." Ocean freighters carrying Chinese machinery and materials also unload goods at this port. This year, just as the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Labor Party, are carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and vigorously grasping grain production, a large number of potato seeds have been transported from Heilongjiang Province in China. At present, these seeds have been planted throughout Albania and are growing vigorously. The experience of Dazhai in Shanxi, China, has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of Albanian farmers. Many agricultural cooperatives, especially those in mountainous areas, built many terraced fields last winter and this spring, and people affectionately call them Albanian "Dazhai."
    The Albanian people deeply love Chairman Mao's works. The Albanian version of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has been published successively in recent years and has been warmly welcomed by the majority of readers. The central organ of the Albanian Labor Party, "The Road of the Party," has continuously published articles pointing out that Chairman Mao's works are "a further development of Marxism-Leninism" and "are of great benefit and great significance to the entire international communist movement, the workers' movement, and the national liberation movement of our time." Last year, Albania also published "Mao Zedong on Youth Work" and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members." Albanian publishing institutions have also translated and published "Lei Feng - A Good Son of the People" and many Chinese literary works. At the entrance of the Tirana International Bookstore, there are often many readers buying Chinese "People's Pictorial."
    In order to enhance the friendship and understanding between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, Albania has recently introduced a large number of Chinese revolutionary modern operas and films. The Albanian theatrical circles once performed the dramas of the Chinese Liberation War period "Growing Up in Battle" and "The White-Haired Girl." In recent years, Chinese dramas such as "The Younger Generation," "Sentinel Under the Neon Lights," and "The South China Sea Great Wall" have been staged in Tirana and Durrës successively. The performances of these programs have been well received by the audience. Recently, the Albanian National Opera and Ballet Theater is rehearsing the Chinese ballet "The Red Detachment of Women." Chinese movies often appear on the screens of Albania.
    The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples are eternal and unbreakable. In the common struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, this great friendship and unity will be continuously consolidated and developed.

### 革命的战斗友谊之花盛开

    革命的战斗友谊之花盛开
    在阿尔巴尼亚，无论你走到那里，到处都可以看到象征着中阿两国人民深厚友谊的标志。
    当我们在地拉那漫步和访问其他城市或农村的时候，常常被一群天真活泼的儿童团团围住。他们抢上前来争着同我们握手，有的用刚刚学会的中国话向我们问好。当你驱车在公路上行驶时，你还可以看到用石块砌成的大字标语：“中国共产党万岁！”
  “阿中友谊万岁！”当我们去参加阿中友好的群众集会的时候，每次都听到“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“友谊是保证”的口号声和欢呼声。
    这几天，在穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团正在中国访问期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民个个喜形于色，象征着中、阿两国人民革命的战斗的友谊之花愈开愈旺盛。
    每天，阿尔巴尼亚报纸、电台大量发表有关阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在中国访问的消息、评论、特稿和图片等。这些报纸和广播报道了阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在中国受到极其热烈欢迎的情况，并向阿尔巴尼亚人民热情地介绍了中国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的光辉成就，以及在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中取得的重大胜利。
    刘少奇、周恩来等中国领导同志和谢胡同志、卡博同志在各次集会上的讲话是阿尔巴尼亚各界人民谈论的中心话题。许多人说，这些讲话对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派是巨大的打击，对全世界革命的人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民是极大的鼓舞。
    北京百万人民热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的消息已经成为中阿两国人民友谊史上的佳话。地拉那许多小学生见到中国人就高兴地叫喊“一百万人”！
    中阿两国人民在反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义斗争中结成的战斗友谊，比山高，比海深，它象水晶般纯洁，象山泉一样清澈。中阿友谊的鲜花到处盛开，而且开得那么美丽、鲜艳。
    为了表达阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的深厚友谊和对中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的热爱，在阿尔巴尼亚的农村中有十个用“毛泽东”、“阿中友好”、“新中国”等名字命名的农业合作社。中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆的工作人员和中国专家经常到卢什涅区的“毛泽东”农业合作社和地拉那区的“新中国”农业合作社参加劳动。正在建设中的一座巨大的纺织联合工厂也被命名为“毛泽东”纺织联合工厂。在费里氮肥厂的建筑工地上，中阿两国专家和工人组成了“中阿友谊班”。地拉那“斯大林”纺织联合工厂的纺织工人成立了“阿中友好生产班”和“雷锋生产队”。地拉那米吉安尼和哈桑·伏果里两所学校分别成立了“刘胡兰班”和“阿中友好班”。地拉那埃明·杜拉克八年制学校的四十六名少年儿童先锋队员，在阅读了《雷锋日记》和观看了《伟大的战士雷锋》影片后，把他们的少年儿童先锋队中队命名为“雷锋中队”，孩子们一致表示，要做阿尔巴尼亚的雷锋。
    中阿两国人民在社会主义建设中总是相互学习，相互帮助的。在都拉斯——“中阿友谊之港”，我们看到满载阿尔巴尼亚物资的万吨巨轮启碇前往中国。前两年阿尔巴尼亚政府赠送给中国的一万株油橄榄苗木，就是从这个“中阿友谊之港”启运的。载着中国机器和物资的远洋货轮也在这座港口卸货。今年，正当阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的领导下，发扬自力更生精神，大抓粮食生产的时候，又从中国的黑龙江省运来了大量土豆种子。目前，这些种子已栽种在阿尔巴尼亚全国各地，并且正在茁壮地生长。中国山西大寨的经验受到了阿尔巴尼亚广大农民的热烈欢迎。许多农业合作社，特别是山区的合作社在去冬今春修建了许多梯田，人们把它们亲切地称为阿尔巴尼亚的“大寨”。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民十分热爱毛主席的著作。《毛泽东选集》的阿尔巴尼亚文版已经在最近几年陆续出版，受到了广大读者的热烈欢迎。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关刊物《党的道路》曾连续发表文章，指出毛主席的著作是“马克思列宁主义的进一步发展”，“对当代整个国际共产主义运动、工人运动和民族解放运动都有很大的好处和十分重大的意义”。去年，阿尔巴尼亚又出版了《毛泽东论青年工作》、刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》等书。阿尔巴尼亚出版机构还翻译出版了《雷锋——人民的好儿子》和许多中国文学作品。在地拉那国际书店门口，常常有许多读者购买中国《人民画报》。
    为了增进阿中两国人民的友谊和了解，阿尔巴尼亚最近大量介绍了中国的革命现代戏和电影。阿尔巴尼亚戏剧界曾经演出了中国解放战争时期的话剧《在战斗里成长》、《白毛女》。近几年来，在地拉那和都拉斯的舞台上，相继演出了《年青的一代》、《霓虹灯下的哨兵》和《南海长城》等中国话剧。这些节目的演出都受到了观众的好评。最近，阿尔巴尼亚国家歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院正在排练中国芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》。中国的电影更是时常出现在阿尔巴尼亚的银幕上。
    中阿两党和两国人民的友谊和团结是永恒的和牢不可破的。在反对帝国主义和反对以苏联领导为中心的现代修正主义的共同斗争中，这一伟大友谊和团结必将不断巩固和发展。
