    American Imperialism Circles in an Anti-China Dead End
    McNamara Advocates "Containment" of China While Fantasizing About "Building Bridges" with China
    Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: Montreal News: U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara, in a speech in Montreal, Canada, on the 18th, on the one hand, clamored that the United States wants its "allies" to join it in containing China, and on the other hand, said that the United States is willing to take steps to "build bridges" with China. McNamara's remarks are nothing more than a rehash of the so-called "containment without isolation" argument recently put forward by the U.S. ruling clique regarding China. McNamara made it clear that so-called "non-isolation" is false, while "containment" is true.
    Speaking at a meeting of the American Newspaper Editors Association in Montreal, Canada, McNamara suggested that the United States "can build bridges" to China "through appropriate and balanced trade relations, diplomatic contacts, and in some cases, even through the exchange of military observers," "break through" China's so-called "isolation from the world," and "reduce the risk of misunderstanding."
    Why is American imperialism, which has always been frantically hostile to China and has tried every means to "isolate" China, now clamoring to "break through" China's so-called "isolation from the world"? It turns out that the policy of hostility towards China pursued by the United States has made the one truly isolated not China, but precisely American imperialism itself. China has friends all over the world, while American imperialism is losing support even among its own allies. McNamara himself felt isolated, panicked and anxiously said: "If...other countries truly believe that containing Communist China...is in the common interest, then they must play a more active role in guarding the defense circle." He complained that America's allies were not supportive enough, emphasizing that they must shoulder more of this common task. This just shows that the U.S. policy of hostility towards China is unpopular, and the U.S. policy of isolating China and building an encirclement around China is encountering increasing difficulties.
    McNamara's speech shows that the United States is妄想to promote a "peaceful evolution" conspiracy through "building bridges" with China. At the same time, the United States has not relaxed its use of war to achieve its aggressive goals. McNamara clamored that "the United States has never been so militarily powerful as it is now," and that "the United States intends to maintain this state of readiness."

    美帝国主义在反华死胡同里兜圈子
    麦克纳马拉鼓吹“遏制”中国又妄想同中国“搭桥”
    新华社十九日讯　蒙特利尔消息：美国国防部长麦克纳马拉十八日在加拿大蒙特利尔发表的一篇演说中，一方面叫嚷美国要“盟国”同它一道来遏制中国，一方面又说什么美国愿意采取步骤同中国“搭桥”。麦克纳马拉这番话不过是美国统治集团近来提出的对中国的所谓“遏制而不孤立”的论调的重弹。麦克纳马拉表明，所谓“不孤立”是假，“遏制”则是真。
    麦克纳马拉在美国报纸编辑协会在加拿大蒙特利尔举行的一个集会上发表演说时，提出了美国“可以通过适当的平衡的贸易关系、外交接触，在一些情况下甚至是通过互派军事观察员”来向中国“搭桥”，“冲破”中国的所谓“与世隔绝状态”，“减少发生误解的危险”。
    一向疯狂仇视中国、千方百计要“孤立”中国的美帝国主义，现在为什么高叫要“冲破”中国的所谓“与世隔绝状态”了呢？原来美国所奉行的敌视中国的政策，使得真正陷于孤立的不是中国，而恰恰是美帝国主义自己。中国朋友遍天下，而美帝国主义甚至在它自己的盟国中也众叛亲离。麦克纳马拉自己就感到孤立得发慌而焦急地说：“如果……其他国家真正认为遏制共产党中国……是符合共同利益的话，那么它们必须在守卫防御圈方面起更积极的作用”。他埋怨美国的盟国对美国支持不力，强调说它们必须更多地担负这项共同任务。这正好说明了美国敌视中国的政策不得人心，美国要孤立中国，在中国周围建立包围圈的政策遇到了越来越大的困难。
    麦克纳马拉的演说表明，美国妄想通过同中国的“搭桥”来推进“和平演变”的阴谋。同时，美国丝毫也没有放松通过战争的一手来达到它的侵略目的。麦克纳马拉叫嚷说：“美国军事上从来没有现在这样强大”，“美国打算保持这种随时准备着的状态”。
