    Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Overseas Chinese from some countries and regions currently visiting Beijing sternly condemn the anti-China, anti-Chinese crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
    An overseas Chinese from France said that the reactionary Indonesian thugs, under the instigation and support of the right-wing military clique, are frantically massacring and ravaging innocent overseas Chinese, recklessly plundering overseas Chinese property, and destroying and occupying legitimate overseas Chinese organizations and schools. They also blatantly violate international legal norms and send armed military police and thugs to unreasonably attack Chinese representative offices in Indonesia. These atrocities are even worse than the heinous crimes committed by the German fascists in Europe.
    An overseas Chinese who returned from Japan said that in a sovereign country, the occurrence of such endless and large-scale barbaric persecution of nationals of another country is clearly supported by the government. The Indonesian government's attempt to shirk responsibility is absolutely unacceptable. He said that today overseas Chinese have a strong motherland, and the era of overseas Chinese being at the mercy of others is gone forever. We want to warn the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces that you must pull back from the brink, otherwise you will be responsible for all the consequences.
    Feng Haixing, an overseas Chinese from Australia, said that Indonesian overseas Chinese have not only contributed to the development of Indonesia's national economy, but have also dedicated their efforts to supporting the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism. In 1926, a group of Indonesian overseas Chinese were exiled to West Irian by the Dutch colonialists for participating in the Indonesian people's struggle for national independence. This group of overseas Chinese suffered greatly, and most of them died. The few surviving overseas Chinese who escaped from the exile and transferred to Australia continued their struggle. They published publications in Australia, gaining widespread sympathy and support from the Australian people for the Indonesian national independence movement. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces today vainly attempt to erase the contributions made by overseas Chinese to create excuses for their persecution of overseas Chinese. This will never succeed. Their anti-China, anti-Chinese crimes will surely be punished by history.
    An overseas Chinese from Latin America said that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary group has openly turned to American imperialism and frantically engaged in anti-Chinese activities in accordance with their master's wishes. We want to warn the Indonesian right-wing group: Today overseas Chinese already have their own strong motherland, and your fascist-style anti-Chinese activities will eventually backfire.
    Overseas Chinese returning from Cambodia, Singapore, Malaya and other countries and regions also strongly condemned the anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes of the Indonesian right-wing.
    These overseas Chinese from all over the world resolutely demand that the Indonesian government immediately stop anti-Chinese activities, abide by international law, protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, and be responsible for sending those persecuted, unable to live, and willing to return to their country back to their motherland. Many people also highly praised the actions of the vast number of Indonesian overseas Chinese in resolutely safeguarding the dignity of their motherland, demonstrating the great national integrity that the Chinese people cannot be humiliated.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese in Guangzhou, Nanning, Harbin, Hefei, Xi'an and other places continue to expose the shocking atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their frantic persecution of overseas Chinese with a large number of facts.
    According to reports, on February 10th of this year, a group of thugs claiming to belong to the "Indonesian University Students United Action Organization" looted the overseas Chinese in Banjarmasin, the capital of South Kalimantan Province. They first destroyed and robbed overseas Chinese shops and residences in the Pasar Baru area of Banjarmasin, and then threatened overseas Chinese not to disclose the situation of the victims. The next afternoon, overseas Chinese shops and residences in Banjarmasin were painted with a skull with two piles of crossed bones on both sides by thugs, and a fascist atmosphere of terror enveloped Banjarmasin. On the morning of the 12th, although the Chinese Consul in Banjarmasin protested to the Governor of South Kalimantan Province regarding the anti-China and anti-Chinese incident on the 10th, and solemnly requested the Indonesian authorities to effectively ensure the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, the Indonesian authorities simply ignored it. At 10 o'clock that morning, a large number of thugs in batches launched a frenzied attack and destruction on overseas Chinese shops and residences throughout Banjarmasin. The thugs used iron rods and other weapons to smash open the doors of overseas Chinese shops and residences, drive the overseas Chinese out of their houses or concentrate them under guard, and then recklessly robbed and destroyed the goods in overseas Chinese shops and the property of overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese were looted so that they didn't even have clothes to change. In the afternoon, the thugs attacked the Banjarmasin Chinese General Association, and even the fire truck set up by the General Association, which often served the residents of Banjarmasin, was overturned and smashed by the thugs. Subsequently, Colonel Sudopo Yuwono, the holder of power for the implementation of the two People's Orders in South Kalimantan Province, announced that a curfew would be imposed in Banjarmasin from that day. That night, the relevant authorities in Banjarmasin sent military police to block the destroyed areas. These military police took advantage of the darkness to steal and transport out the few remaining properties in overseas Chinese shops and residences. After these few days of destruction and robbery, many overseas Chinese were in a difficult situation of being impoverished and unable to make a living.
    When the right-wing thugs carried out frantic robbery and destruction of overseas Chinese shops and residences throughout Banjarmasin, military police followed behind them. While the thugs were destroying overseas Chinese shops and residences, they shouted wildly "Long live the armed forces!" and the military police following immediately raised their hands in response.
    Returned overseas Chinese from Medan revealed some appalling atrocities in the "Medan Massacre" on December 10th last year. Indonesian right-wing thugs in Medan shouted and chased after overseas Chinese when they saw them. Some overseas Chinese were caught and beaten severely by thugs, and some were brutally killed.
    In front of the Halat Market, an overseas Chinese was killed and died, and blood flowed all over the ground. In a fish market, the thugs took up pig-slaughtering knives, fish knives, and beef knives, and beat and killed the overseas Chinese indiscriminately. Many overseas Chinese were killed. Some of the dead had their heads cut open, some had their necks cut off, some had their chests pierced, some had their intestines flowing out of their bodies, some had their faces blurred by knife cuts, and some even had their eyes gouged out.
    Returned overseas Chinese from Lampung Province, Sumatra, revealed that on March 21st, a group of right-wing thugs carrying the banner of the so-called "Indonesian Youth and Students United Action Organization" (KAPI) drove in cars and set off in two routes to the two urban areas of Telukbetung and Tanjungkarang in Lampung Province. After the thugs got off the cars in the urban areas, they shouted anti-Chinese slogans and destroyed overseas Chinese shops and residences along the way. In the center of Telukbetung City, a group of thugs rushed into the Lampung Overseas Chinese General Association, smashed doors and windows, destroyed furniture, seized the Chinese national flag hanging in the auditorium, and tore up the image of Chairman Liu Shaoqi. The right-wing thugs also forcibly occupied overseas Chinese organizations such as the Lampung Overseas Chinese Youth Federation and the Fujian Association, attacked Hua Lian Middle and Elementary School, Xin Zhong Middle and Elementary School, and Qing Lian School, knocked Hua Lian School teacher Li Jingxing unconscious on the spot, and robbed the school's public funds and teachers' watches, pens and other property. On this day, overseas Chinese shops on many streets in Telukbetung and Tanjungkarang cities were frantically destroyed and robbed by right-wing thugs.
    Returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese also revealed the atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in cruelly persecuting overseas Chinese in Lombok, Alas Island, Magelang City in Central Java, and Jakarta. Returned overseas Chinese Liu Nanyan revealed that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in Magelang City, Central Java, recently burned down the tapioca flour factory he jointly operated with others, robbed all of his family's property, and forced his family of seven to be displaced, and their whereabouts are still unknown. Returned overseas Chinese Li Guihua revealed that his cousin Li Fuguang, who lived in Jakarta, was shot three times and seriously injured and died one night during the Spring Festival this year for stopping right-wing thugs from robbing his belongings.
    Returned overseas Chinese revealed that the Indonesian military police participated in these anti-Chinese and anti-China activities. When thugs massacred overseas Chinese in Singaraja, Bali, Lieutenant Colonel Karlmin, the head of the Singaraja garrison regiment, and the director of the police station's National Security Bureau were both at the scene. In West Java, right-wing thugs were transported by military vehicles when they went to various places to commit crimes. In some places, there were even soldiers openly directing the thugs to commit crimes on the spot. In some places, the police on the scene would blow a few whistles when the destruction of an overseas Chinese shop or residence was almost complete, and the thugs would rush to another place like a swarm.
    Huang Zongkui, a returned overseas Chinese worker from the Guangxi Wuming Overseas Chinese Farm, revealed that on November 10th last year, when the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces frantically persecuted overseas Chinese in Jepara Regency, Central Java, army paratroopers took his cousin Huang Zonggui away from his home, and later he was doused with kerosene and burned alive by thugs on the way.
    Returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese were filled with righteous indignation when they exposed the above-mentioned atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. They pointed out that the powerful socialist motherland is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese, and the blood debts owed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces will surely be thoroughly settled one day. The Indonesian government must immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese and promptly give a satisfactory reply to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note of May 18th.

    来自亚澳欧美的华侨声讨印尼反动势力暴行
    华侨有强大祖国，排华罪行必受惩罚
    各地印尼归侨和家属警告印尼右派必须立即停止排华
    新华社二十九日讯　正在北京参观访问的一些国家和地区的华侨严厉谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华、排华的罪行。
    一位来自法国的华侨说，印度尼西亚的反动暴徒在右派军人集团的策动和支持下，疯狂屠杀和蹂躏无辜华侨，肆无忌惮地劫夺华侨财产，捣毁、霸占合法的华侨社团和学校。他们还公然破坏国际法准则，派武装军警和暴徒无理袭击中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构。他们的这些暴行，比之当年德国法西斯在欧洲所犯的滔天罪行，有过之而无不及。
    从日本归来的一位华侨说，在一个主权国家里，竟然出现对另一个国家的侨民发生如此层出不穷的、大规模的野蛮迫害，显然是得到政府的支持。印度尼西亚政府企图推卸责任是绝对不行的。他说，今天华侨有了强大的祖国，华侨任人宰割的时代已经一去不复返了。我们要警告印度尼西亚右派反动势力，你们必须悬崖勒马，否则一切后果将由你们负责。
    澳大利亚华侨冯海星说，印度尼西亚华侨不仅在发展印度尼西亚民族经济方面做出过贡献，而且在支持印度尼西亚人民反帝、反殖的斗争中，也献出了自己的力量。一九二六年，一批印度尼西亚华侨由于参加印度尼西亚人民争取民族独立的斗争，曾被荷兰殖民主义者流放到西伊里安。这批华侨受尽苦难，大多数死亡，幸存的少数华侨在逃出流放地转到澳大利亚后，仍然坚持斗争。他们在澳大利亚出版刊物，争取到广大澳大利亚人民对印度尼西亚民族独立运动的同情和支持。印度尼西亚右派反动势力今天妄想一笔抹煞华侨所作出的贡献，为其迫害华侨的暴行制造借口，这是永远不会得逞的。他们的反华、排华罪行，一定要受到历史的惩罚。
    来自拉丁美洲的一位华侨说，印度尼西亚右派反动集团公开投向美帝国主义，秉承他们主子的意旨疯狂排华，我们要警告印度尼西亚右派集团：今天华侨已经有了自己强大的祖国，你们法西斯式的排华活动，终究要搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    柬埔寨和新加坡、马来亚等国家和地区回来的华侨，也都强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派的反华排华罪行。
    这些来自世界各地的华侨坚决要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止排华活动，遵守国际公法，保护华侨的正当权利和利益，负责送回那些惨遭迫害、无法生活、自愿回国的华侨到自己的祖国。许多人还高度赞扬了广大印度尼西亚华侨坚决维护祖国尊严的行动，表现了中国人民不可侮的伟大民族气节。
    据新华社二十九日讯　广州、南宁、哈尔滨、合肥、西安等地的印度尼西亚归国华侨和华侨眷属，继续以大量事实，揭露印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨的骇人听闻的暴行。
    据揭露，今年二月十日，一批自称属于“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的暴徒，对南加里曼丹省省会马辰的华侨进行了洗劫。他们先捣毁和抢劫了马辰市新巴刹地区的华侨商店和住宅，并在事后威胁华侨不准把受害情况向外泄露。第二天下午，马辰的华侨商店和住宅上都被暴徒用漆涂上了一个骷髅两旁各有两堆交叉尸骨的标记，法西斯恐怖的气氛笼罩着马辰。十二日上午，尽管中国驻马辰领事向南加里曼丹省省长就十日的反华排华事件提出了抗议，严正要求印度尼西亚当局切实保障华侨生命财产的安全，但是印度尼西亚当局根本置之不理。当天上午十时，大批暴徒分批对马辰全市的华侨商店和住宅进行了疯狂的袭击和破坏。暴徒用铁棍等凶器砸开华侨商店和住宅的门户，把华侨赶出屋外或把他们集中看守起来，然后肆无忌惮地抢劫、破坏华侨商店的货物和华侨的财物。不少华侨被洗劫得连替换的衣服都没有。下午，暴徒又袭击了马辰中华总会，连总会设置的经常为马辰全市居民服务的消防车，也被暴徒推翻砸毁。接着，南加里曼丹省执行两项人民命令掌权者苏多波·尤沃诺上校宣布，当天起在马辰实行宵禁。当天晚上，马辰有关当局派出军警封锁被破坏的地区，这些军警趁着黑夜，又把华侨商店和住宅内幸存无几的财物盗运出去。经过这几天的破坏和抢劫，许多华侨处于倾家荡产、生计无着的困苦境地。
    右派暴徒在马辰全市对华侨商店和住宅进行疯狂的抢劫、破坏时，后面都有军警跟随。暴徒一面对华侨商店和住宅进行破坏，一面狂呼“武装部队万岁！”，尾随的军警随即举手响应。
    棉兰的归侨揭露了去年十二月十日“棉兰惨案”中一些令人发指的暴行。印度尼西亚右派暴徒在棉兰市看见华侨就狂叫追赶，有的华侨被暴徒抓住毒打，有的被惨杀。
    在花拉甘市场前，有一名华侨被杀身死，鲜血流了一地。在一个鱼市场内，暴徒们拿起杀猪刀、鱼刀、牛肉刀，对华侨乱打乱杀，有许多华侨遇害，死者中有的头被砍破，有的颈子被砍断，有的胸口被刺穿，有的肠子流出体外，有的面目被刀砍得模糊不清，有的连眼睛也被挖掉。
    来自苏门答腊岛楠榜省的归侨揭露说，三月二十一日，一批打着所谓“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”（卡比）旗号的右派暴徒乘着汽车，分成两路向楠榜省的鹿勿洞、丹绒加冷两个市区进发。暴徒们在市区下车后狂叫反华口号，捣毁沿途的华侨商店和住宅。在的鹿勿洞市中心，一群暴徒冲进楠榜华侨总会，砸碎门窗，打毁家具，夺走了悬挂在礼堂里的中国国旗，撕碎了刘少奇主席的象。右派暴徒还强占了楠榜华侨青年联合会、福建会馆等华侨社团，袭击了华联中、小学校，新中中、小学校和青联学校，把华联学校教师李景星当场打昏在地，抢去了校内的公款和教师们的手表、钢笔等财物。这一天，的鹿勿洞、丹绒加冷市许多条街上的华侨商店遭到右派暴徒的疯狂破坏和抢劫。
    归侨和侨眷们还揭露了印度尼西亚右派反动势力在龙目岛、阿拉史岛、中爪哇马吉冷市以及雅加达等地残酷迫害华侨的暴行。归侨刘南雁揭露，中爪哇马吉冷市的印度尼西亚右派反动势力最近烧毁了他家与别人合股经营的薯粉厂，抢走了他家全部财产，迫使他一家七口人流离失所，至今生死不明。归侨李桂华揭露，他住在雅加达的堂哥李富光在今年春节期间的一个晚上因为阻拦右派暴徒抢劫自己的东西，竟被暴徒连开三枪受重伤后死亡。
    归侨们揭露，印度尼西亚军警参与了这些排华反华活动。暴徒在巴厘岛新加拉野惨杀华侨时，新加拉野的驻军团长卡尔敏中校和警署国家安全局主任都在现场。在西爪哇，右派暴徒到各地行凶时都由军车运送，有的地方甚至公然有军人在现场指挥暴徒行凶。有的地方在场的警察看到对一处华侨商店或住宅破坏得差不多了，就吹几声警笛，暴徒就一窝蜂似地冲向另外一处。
    广西武鸣华侨农场归侨职工黄宗奎揭露，去年十一月十日，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在中爪哇日巴拉县疯狂迫害华侨时，陆军伞兵把他的堂兄黄宗桂从家里带走，后来在半路上被暴徒用煤油浇在身上活活烧死。
    归国华侨和华侨眷属们在揭露印度尼西亚右派反动势力的上述暴行时义愤填膺。他们指出，强大的社会主义祖国是华侨最有力的靠山，印度尼西亚右派反动势力欠下的血债必将有被彻底清算的一天。印度尼西亚政府必须立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，并且迅速对中国外交部五月十八日的照会作出圆满答复。
