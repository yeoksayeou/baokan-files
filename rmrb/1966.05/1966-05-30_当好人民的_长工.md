Editor's Note: We are very pleased to recommend these three articles to our readers. The authors of these articles are cadres from three ethnic minority groups. Not long ago, they participated in the Southwest Region's Conference of Activists in Studying Chairman Mao's Works among Leading Cadres at and above the County Level, and introduced their experiences in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to the representatives present, which were warmly welcomed.

The authors of these articles were all slaves who were exploited and oppressed before liberation. After liberation, under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought and in the fiery struggle of class struggle, they grew up rapidly. From them, we prominently see the great power of Mao Zedong Thought.

Whether or not one can master Mao Zedong Thought does not depend on the level of education, but on whether one has deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, and whether one regards Chairman Mao's words as the supreme instructions for all work. The fundamental reason why the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers can creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and learn and apply them well, is that they infinitely love Chairman Mao's works and infinitely believe in Mao Zedong Thought. They do whatever Chairman Mao says, put great effort into the word "apply," and are determined to train themselves into staunch proletarian fighters.

"To make revolution, one cannot do without the Communist Party, and one cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought," this is a truth they have realized in the process of revolutionary practice and in the process of studying Chairman Mao's works.

Being a Good "Hired Hand" for the People
Wu Xiangbi, Secretary of the Songtao Miao Autonomous County Committee of the Communist Party of China (Miao Ethnicity)

To Make Revolution, One Must Study Hard

I started herding cattle for landlords at the age of ten, and worked as a hired hand at the age of seventeen, working for landlords for a full twelve years.

In the old society, I never stepped into a school. Asking me to work hard, run errands, and speak was okay, but asking me to hold a pen was much harder than holding a plow. In the early days of liberation, when I worked in the village, when the district or county sent a notice, I had to run more than ten miles to ask someone to read it; when the higher authorities conveyed the Party's policies, I relied solely on my memory. It was really difficult to make revolution without culture! I made a firm decision to study culture diligently. From then on, no matter where I went, no matter which literate comrade I met, I would learn a few characters from them. I also made a small blackboard and wrote and practiced whenever I had time, and slowly I could recognize and write a few characters.

In July 1952, I joined the Communist Party of China. At this time, my understanding underwent a great change, and I understood that a Communist Party member must work for the realization of communism for a lifetime, and work to the end for the liberation of all mankind. With this understanding, my enthusiasm was even greater, and no matter what difficulties I encountered, I dared to tackle them. The following spring, the Party sent me to the Policy Research Class of the Guiyang Nationalities Institute to study. At this time, I had not yet shed the label of illiteracy, and it was even more difficult to study political theory and the Party's ethnic policies. Sometimes I felt pessimistic, but when I thought of the suffering I had endured in the old society, when I thought of the Party's cultivation of me after liberation, when I thought of my determination to fight for communism when I joined the Party, when I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching that "Our worker-peasant cadres must first learn culture in order to learn theory," my courage and confidence to overcome difficulties were sufficient. I listened attentively in class, reviewed carefully after class, and seized the time before and after meals to study, practicing writing characters, and my hands were worn out. I endured the pain and insisted on learning. Under the kind care of the Party organization of the college and the guidance of the teachers, I finally completed the study task assigned to me by the Party and was rated as a model student in the whole college. After returning to the county, I served as the Deputy Secretary of the Niulang District Committee. From 1956, I served as the Deputy Secretary of the County Committee. Since taking on leadership work, I have personally written all the reports that the Party Committee has asked me to make to cadres and the masses. If I couldn't write a character, I would leave it blank and ask a comrade for help. No matter how busy I was with work, I insisted on doing this.

To Make Revolution, One Must Go Deep into Practice

I grew up in a peaceful environment and have not experienced the test of revolutionary war. As soon as I took on leadership work, I deeply felt that my theoretical and policy level, and work experience were very incompatible with the responsibilities I assumed. What should I do? Chairman Mao said: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." This sentence gave me tremendous strength, encouraging me to persist in going deep into practice, and to train and improve myself in practice. Therefore, whenever I encounter major events, I must go deep into the scene, personally see the size of the "pears" and taste the flavor of the "pears" myself.

In the winter of 1964, the County Committee decided to build the Zhengda Reservoir to divert and store the water of the Suma River, so that the Pantang Brigade could basically achieve water conservancy. As soon as the plan was proposed, it was opposed by the commune cadres. A commune Party secretary said: The existing Suma River canal cannot even irrigate the downstream. Now you want to build a large reservoir of more than three million cubic meters. Unless you use urine to irrigate it; if it is built and not an empty reservoir, I will reverse my surname. After research, the County Committee believed that it could not lightly believe this view and decided to conduct a serious investigation and study. I and the comrades of the County Planning Commission walked along the canal, up the river, for a whole day before we reached the source. The problem was finally clarified: First, the water at the source was very large, which could guarantee the water for the reservoir; second, the canal section passing through the hanging rock was too narrow, and the water head overflowed the embankment surface, and a large amount flowed down the hanging rock; third, the canal section with foamy sandy soil had serious seepage. We put forward a supplementary plan to widen the rock canal and plug the sand canal leakage, and reported to the County Committee, which fully agreed. Last spring, the reservoir was finally built, and more than three million cubic meters of water were stored; the Pantang Brigade in the main irrigation area changed from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team in one year. The existing water is still not used up, and it is planned to open another ditch to divert the excess water to the Baojia Brigade. Now the saying of urinating to irrigate the reservoir has become a joke, and it has also become a negative teaching material for overcoming bureaucracy.

Sweet potatoes are the main miscellaneous grains in Songtao. People say: "Sweet potatoes are half a year's grain." But in the past few years, sweet potatoes were almost rotten by the time of the Spring Festival. Every year, we had to buy sweet potato seeds from Tongren and Yuping counties. At that time, some comrades saw that the sweet potatoes were rotting more and more each year, and there was no solution, so they were somewhat disappointed. The County Committee was very concerned about this matter. In order to eliminate sweet potato black spot disease, the County Committee decided to conduct a comparative investigation. After obtaining the consent of the County Committee, I went to conduct a comparative investigation. I heard that the Muxi Production Team of the Yinyan Commune had never had rotten sweet potatoes since 1958, so we drilled into four or five sweet potato cellars in that team, and also sat down with the cadres and experienced old farmers there to discuss the experience of not rotting sweet potatoes. After looking and arranging, the problem was clarified: First, the sweet potato cellars of this team all faced the sun, with sufficient sunlight and air circulation. When the weather warmed up, the sweet potato cellars were opened to allow sunlight and air to flow freely, and the cellars were kept dry at all times; second, the bottom of the cellar extended to both sides, and the sweet potatoes were all on both sides, with a small path for ventilation and walking in the middle, so that sunlight and air had room to circulate, and people also had a place to set foot, so that the sweet potatoes would not be stepped on and broken; third, when putting and taking sweet potatoes, the hands and feet should be light, so as not to touch and break the sweet potatoes. With this experience, we looked at a few places where sweet potatoes were rotten, and the methods of digging sweet potato cellars and storing sweet potatoes were all problematic. After returning, we reported to the County Committee, which attached great importance to these experiences and decided to run a training class combining indigenous and foreign methods, on the one hand, to continue to promote advanced experience from other places, and on the other hand, to vigorously advocate the transformation of sweet potato cellars and improve management methods. In the last winter alone, more than 2,400 sweet potato cellars were dug in the county, greatly reducing the phenomenon of rotten sweet potatoes. Not only has the situation of importing sweet potato seeds from other places every year been changed, but also, this year we have supported other places with hundreds of thousands of catties of our own sweet potato seeds.

To Make Revolution, One Must Face Difficulties

When I first took on the leadership work in the district, some intellectual cadres looked down on me and often gave me difficult problems. I had some ideological burden, fearing that making mistakes would cause losses to the work. The leading comrades of the County Committee constantly encouraged me, and most of the old comrades in the District Committee warmly supported me and helped me to earnestly study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught: "The more difficult the place, the more you have to go, that is a good comrade." I thought that was right! Doing work is like a child learning to walk. If you are afraid of falling, and you always lie in bed, you will never learn to walk in your life. Since we want to make revolution, we cannot be afraid of being looked down upon by others. The more others look down on me, the more I want to do it. From then on, I boldly took up the work.

During the period of agricultural collectivization, the biggest natural disaster in our Niulang District was "fierce sand and evil water." When there was a heavy rain, the water would rise, and mountain torrents would rush around with mud and sand, washing away the field embankments and burying the crops. People called this "fierce sand and evil water" "sand tiger" and "evil yellow dragon." There is a song that has been passed down from generation to generation here: "Niulang mountain ravine is a poor place, rain and drought are both disasters, if you want to live a good life, horses will grow horns and sand will become grain." I grew up in this place and have a deep feeling for this disaster. I often thought like this: Can't we touch the butt of this "sand tiger"? Can't we lock up this "evil yellow dragon"? No, that was the case in the old society. Now, there is the leadership of the Party above, the support of the masses below, and the superiority of the collective economy. As long as the leaders roll up their trousers and lead the masses to work together, and consult with the masses in case of trouble, there will be no "tiger" that cannot be killed and no "evil dragon" that cannot be locked up. Therefore, when the District Committee decided to focus on Niulang Township to carry out the mountain and water management movement, I and the comrades of the District Committee led the masses of Niulang Township to fight against "fierce sand and evil water," determined to subdue the "sand tiger" and the "evil yellow dragon." Whenever I encountered difficulties in this struggle, I would consult with everyone according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses." In the slack season, mobilize the masses for a big assault; in the busy season, only leave a professional team to attack the pillboxes. In this way, after three years of hard work, the whole township built more than 400 projects such as valley workshops, retaining mountain ditches, flood control dikes, and sediment ponds, split open the two mountains of Zhongzhai and Jigongtian, turned river beaches into nearly 100 acres of paddy fields, and converted sloping fields into more than 400 acres of terraced fields, controlling the soil erosion of ninety-eight bends, forty-five dams, and more than fifty ditches; and won the Soil and Water Conservation Award flag issued by the State Council. This project has been tested for more than ten years. Although it was hit by an unusually large flood in 1963, agricultural production still achieved a bumper harvest. The masses said: "This is the 'lock of happiness' that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have given us, locking up the 'sand tiger' and the 'evil yellow dragon' that have been harming us for thousands of years."

These things have greatly educated me: When dealing with difficulties, we can only fight, not bow our heads; we can only face them, not shrink back. If you dare to fight, difficulties will become the "stepping stones" for progress; if you are frightened by difficulties, they will become the "stumbling block" for progress and the "stumbling block" for victory.

To Make Revolution, One Must Be a Good "Hired Hand" for the People

I often think like this: Before liberation, I worked as a hired hand for the landlord to find a way to survive; now, I am a "hired hand" for the people for the sake of revolution and for the realization of communism. Therefore, I must diligently study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm myself, abandon private interests, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

Chairman Mao taught: "All our working cadres, no matter how high or low their positions are, are servants of the people, and everything we do is to serve the people." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, I feel that the more leading cadres, the more we must regard ourselves as members of the ordinary masses, the more we must maintain close ties with the masses, and the more we must keep the sufferings of the masses in mind.

In the second half of the night of July 12, 1963, Songtao had heavy rain, and the river rose sharply, flooding the county seat. Seeing that the situation was serious, the County Committee immediately organized a rescue team to carry out rescue. The comrades knew that I couldn't swim, and worried that I would be in danger, so they pulled me and didn't let me get on the boat. I thought, this is a major event related to the safety of the lives of the people of the whole city, how can I not go, so I resolutely went to the scene with the comrades. As soon as I arrived at the scene, the situation became clear. There were only a few small boats. After saving people, the householders also wanted to save their property, and the progress was very slow. The County Committee immediately decided after research that all people should be rescued first, and then materials should be rescued after the people were rescued. And mobilize all organs and departments to get door panels and tie up wooden rafts. All the tools that could save people were put into battle together. When our boat rowed to the door of a resident's house, there were two old women on the house. No matter how we mobilized them, they were unwilling to come down. Seeing that the situation was very critical, we couldn't care so much, and quickly hugged them onto the boat. Before the boat left, the two houses were washed down by the flood. In this way, under the direct leadership of the County Committee, after more than three hours of rescue by the people of the whole city, all the cadres, and workers, the rescue was finally completed. Not a single person was killed or injured in the whole city. Afterwards, everyone naturally set up a comparison between the new and old societies. The old people said: In 1929, when there was a big flood, the Kuomintang county government set up two machine guns at the entrance of the county government to prevent the common people from approaching, fearing that the masses would break into the county government to open warehouses and distribute grain; now, the Communist Party and the People's Government have taken us to live upstairs and issued relief grain. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really our benefactors.

The above are some of my experiences and gains in studying Chairman Mao's works. I have not learned enough, especially in the transformation of the world outlook, there is still a great distance from the requirements of a Communist Party member. The backward face of our Songtao has not been fundamentally changed. The revolutionization of the core of the County Committee leadership has just begun. I am determined to work with the comrades to study Chairman Mao's works hard, thoroughly transform my world outlook, and fight to the end for changing the backward face of Songtao, for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

### 当好人民的“长工”
吴向必

第4版()
专栏：

    编者按：我们非常高兴地向读者推荐这三篇文章。文章的作者是三个兄弟民族的干部。不久前，他们参加了西南区县以上领导干部学习毛主席著作积极分子会议，向到会代表介绍了自己活学活用毛主席著作的体会，受到热烈的欢迎。
    文章的作者都是解放前被剥削、被压迫的奴隶。解放后，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争的烈火里，他们迅速地成长起来。从他们身上，我们突出地看到毛泽东思想的伟大力量。
    能不能把毛泽东思想学到手，不在于文化程度的高低，而在于是否对毛主席著作怀有深厚的阶级感情，是不是把毛主席的话当作各项工作的最高指示。广大工农兵群众所以能活学活用毛主席著作，学得好、用得好，根本原因就在于他们无限热爱毛主席著作，无限信仰毛泽东思想。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做，在“用”字上狠下功夫，决心把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级战士。
    “要革命，就离不开共产党，就离不开毛泽东思想”，这是他们在革命的实践过程中，在学习毛主席著作的过程中，所认识到的一个真理。
    当好人民的“长工”
    中共贵州省松桃苗族自治县县委书记　吴向必（苗族）
    要革命就得刻苦学习
    我从十岁起，就给地主放牛，十七岁当长工，整整给地主干了十二年活。
    在旧社会，我没有踏过学堂门。叫我出力干活，跑腿办事，动口说话还行，若叫我捏笔杆，那可比扶犁头难多了。解放初期，我在村里工作，区里、县里来个通知，我要跑十几里路去请人念；上级传达党的方针政策，我光凭脑子记。干革命没有文化可真难呀！我就发了个狠，刻苦学文化。从那以后，不管到什么地方，不管碰到那个识字的同志，我都要向他们学几个字。我还做了一块小黑板，有空就写，就练，慢慢地就认得写得几个字了。
    一九五二年七月，我参加了中国共产党。这时候，我的认识发生了个大变化，懂得了共产党员要为实现共产主义干一辈子，为解放全人类干到底。有了这个认识，干劲更足了，无论遇到什么困难，我都敢碰碰它。第二年春天，党又把我送到贵阳民族学院政策研究班去学习，这时我还没有摘掉文盲帽子，学习政治理论和党的民族政策，困难就更大了。有时也有些悲观，可是，一想到我在旧社会受的那些苦，一想到解放后党对我的培养，一想到入党宣誓时要为共产主义奋斗的决心，一想到毛主席的教导“我们的工农干部要学理论，必须首先学文化”，克服困难的勇气和信心就足了。我上课用心听，下课用心复习，饭前饭后也抓紧时间学，练习写字，手都磨烂了，忍着痛也要坚持学。在学院党组织的亲切关怀和教师的教导下，终于完成了党交给我的学习任务，评上了全院的学习模范。回县以后，担任了牛郎区委副书记。一九五六年起，我又担任了县委副书记。从担负领导工作以来，凡是党委叫我向干部和群众作的报告，我都亲自动笔写。不会写的字就空下来向同志请教。不管工作怎样忙，都坚持这样作。
        要革命就得深入实践
    我是在和平环境中成长起来的，没有经过革命战争的考验。一担任领导工作，我就深深感到自己的理论、政策水平、工作经验和自己所担负的责任相比，很不相称。怎么办呢？毛主席说：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”这句话给了我巨大的力量，鼓舞着我坚持深入实践，在实践中来锻炼和提高自己。因此，凡是碰到大的事情，我都要深入现场，亲自看看“梨子”的大小，亲口吃一吃“梨子”的味道。
    一九六四年冬，县委决定修一个正大水库，把苏马河的水引蓄起来，使盘塘大队基本实现水利化。计划一提出，就遭到公社干部的反对。有一位公社党委书记说：现有的苏马河渠道，都灌不到下游，又要修一个三百多万方的大水库，除非屙尿去灌；要是修起来不是空库，我的姓就倒转来。县委经过研究，认为不能轻信这种看法，决定认真调查研究一下。我同县计委的同志一道，沿着渠道，顺河而上，整整走了一整天，才走到了水源头。问题终于弄清了：第一，源头水很大，可以保证水库用水；第二，穿过悬岩的渠段，渠面太窄，水头漫过堤面，大量地流下悬岩；第三，泡沙土质的渠段，渗漏现象严重。我们就提了一个岩渠打宽、沙渠堵漏的补充方案，向县委作了汇报，县委完全同意。去年春天，这个水库终于修成了，三百多万方水蓄起来了；主要灌区的盘塘大队，一年就由缺粮队变成了余粮队。现有的水还用不完，准备再开一条沟，把多余的水引到包家大队。现在屙尿灌水库的说法，已经变成了人们开玩笑的资料，也成了克服官僚主义的反面教材。
    红苕是松桃的主要杂粮。人们都说：“苕顶半年粮”。但是前几年一到春节前后，红苕就差不多烂完了。年年都要向铜仁、玉屏两县去买苕种。当时有些同志看到红苕一年比一年烂得多，又没有解决办法，有些失望了。县委对这件事非常关心。为了消灭红苕黑斑病，县委决定搞对比调查。我在取得县委同意后，去搞对比调查。听说银岩公社木溪生产队从一九五八年以来，一直没有烂过红苕，我们就到那个队钻了四、五个红苕窖，又跟那里的干部和有经验的老农在一起座谈不烂苕的经验。一看一摆，问题就弄清了：第一，这个队的苕窖，洞口一律向阳，阳光充足，空气流通，一遇暖和天气，就把苕窖打开，让阳光、空气畅通，经常保持窖的干燥；第二，窖底向两边伸展，苕都在两边，中间留有通风走路的小道，阳光、空气都有回转的余地，人也有下脚的地方，不会踩坏红苕；第三，放苕、取苕手脚要轻，不碰断碰烂红苕。有了这个经验，我们又看了几个烂苕的地方，挖苕窖、保管红苕办法都有问题。回来以后，我们向县委作了汇报，县委很重视这些经验，决定再办一个土洋结合的训练班，一面继续推广外地先进经验，一面大力提倡改造苕窖，改进管理方法。光去年一冬，全县就挖了两千四百多个苕窖，大大地减少了烂苕的现象。不仅改变了年年向外地调进苕种的状况，而且，我们今年还把自己的苕种支援了外地几十万斤。
      要革命就得迎着困难上
    我刚担任区的领导工作时，有个别知识分子干部看不起我，经常给我出难题，我思想有点负担，怕犯了错误使工作受损失。县委领导同志则不断鼓励我，区委成员中的大多数老同志，都热情地支持我，帮助我，鼓励我去认真学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我想对呀！干工作就跟小孩子学走路一样，怕跌倒，老是躺在床上，一辈子也学不会走路。既然要革命就不能怕别人看不起，别人越是看不起，我越是要干。从此，我就大着胆子把工作抓起来了。
    在农业合作化期间，我们牛郎区最大的自然灾害，就是“凶沙恶水”，一落暴雨，就涨大水，山洪夹着泥沙到处乱闯，冲垮了田坎，埋掉了庄稼。人们把这“凶沙恶水”叫作“沙老虎”、“恶黄龙”。这里祖祖辈辈流传着这样一首歌谣：“牛郎山沟穷地方，雨涝晴旱两遭殃，要想日子过得好，马生角来沙变粮。”我就生长在这个地方，对这种灾害是感受很深的。我经常这样想：难道这只“沙老虎”的屁股就摸不得吗？难道这条“恶黄龙”就锁不住吗？不，那是旧社会的事情。现在，上有党的领导，下有群众的支持，又有集体经济的优越性，只要当领导的挽起裤脚带领群众一起干，遇事与群众商量，就没有打不死的“老虎”，锁不住的“恶龙”。因此，当区委决定以牛郎乡为重点开展治山治水运动后，我就和区委同志一道领导起牛郎乡的群众向“凶沙恶水”作斗争，决心制服“沙老虎”和“恶黄龙”。在这场斗争中一遇到困难，我就根据毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导，找大家商量。农闲时，发动群众大突击；农忙时，只留下专业队突击攻碉堡。就是这样，经过连续三年的苦战，全乡共修起谷坊、拦山沟、防洪堤、沉沙氹等工程四百多处，劈开了中寨和鸡公田的两座大山，变河滩为水田近一百亩，改坡田为梯田四百多亩，控制了九十八道弯，四十五个坝和五十多条沟的水土流失；并获得了国务院颁发的水土保持奖旗。这个工程，已经受了十几年的考验，一九六三年虽然遭到一次百年不遇的特大洪水，农业生产仍然获得了丰收。群众说：“这是共产党和毛主席给我们送来了‘幸福锁’，把千年为害的‘沙老虎’和‘恶黄龙’锁住了。”
    这些事，对我教育很大：对待困难，只能斗争，不能低头；只能迎上去，不能缩回来。如果你敢斗争，困难就变成前进的“垫脚板”；如果你被困难吓倒，它就变成前进的“拦路虎”，胜利的“绊脚石”。
    要革命就得当好人民的“长工”
    我常这样想：解放前，我给地主当长工，那是为了找条生路；现在，我给人民当“长工”，是为了革命，是为了实现共产主义。因此就得刻苦学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己，丢掉私利，全心全意为人民服务。
    毛主席教导说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。按照毛主席的教导，我觉得越是领导干部，越要把自己当成普通群众的一员，越要密切联系群众，越要把群众的疾苦放在心上。
    一九六三年七月十二日下半夜，松桃落大雨，河水猛涨，淹进了县城。县委看到情况严重，立即组织了抢救队，进行抢救。同志们知道我不会水，担心我出危险，拉着不让我上船。我想，这是有关全城人民生命安全的大事，怎能不去，就坚决和同志们一道去现场。一到现场，情况就看得清楚了。只有几条小船，救了人，户主还要救财产，进度很慢，县委立即研究决定，一律先救人，救完人再救物资。并动员所有机关、部门，下门板，扎木排，凡是可以救人的工具都一起上阵。当我们的船划到一家居民门口时，房子上有两个老太婆，无论怎样动员都不愿下来，一看情况十分危急，我们就顾不得许多了，很快把她们抱到船上来，船还没有离开，那两间房子就被大水冲倒了。就是这样，在县委的直接领导下，经过全城人民、全体干部、职工一连三个多小时的抢救，终于抢救完毕。全城没有一个人伤亡。事后，大家就很自然地摆起新旧社会对比。老年人说：一九二九年涨大水，国民党县政府门口架起两挺机关枪不准老百姓接近，怕的是群众闯进县府开仓分粮；现在，共产党和人民政府，却把我们接到楼上来住，还发救济粮，共产党和毛主席真是我们的大恩人。
    上面是我学习毛主席著作的一些体会和收获。我学的还很不够，特别是在世界观的改造上同一个共产党员的要求还有很大距离。我们松桃的落后面貌还没有根本改变。县委领导核心的革命化还刚刚开始。我决心和同志们一起，努力学习毛主席著作，彻底改造自己的世界观，为改变松桃的落后面貌，为中国革命和世界革命终身奋斗到底。
