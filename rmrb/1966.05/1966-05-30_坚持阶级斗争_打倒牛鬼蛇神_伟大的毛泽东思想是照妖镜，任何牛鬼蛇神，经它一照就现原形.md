    Persist in Class Struggle, Overthrow the Demons and Monsters!
    The Great Mao Zedong Thought is a Demon-Revealing Mirror; Any Demon or Monster Will Reveal Its True Form When It is Shone Upon!
    Xin Changzhi, Secretary of the Party Branch of Gucheng Brigade, Wuzhong County, Ningxia, a National Dazhai-Type Agricultural Model

    Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and their small clique opened a black inn, wrote black books, and spoke black words, opposing the Party and socialism. This is truly infuriating! Let me tell you, your attempt to undermine the foundation of socialism and restore capitalism will never succeed! We will resolutely criticize your anti-Party and anti-socialist actions. Now that we have caught your fox tails, this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! We will surely discredit and overthrow you, and we will uproot your anti-Party and anti-socialist black line and thoroughly destroy the "Three-Family Village" black inn!
    Deng Tuo and his gang are the enemies without guns that Chairman Mao spoke of. They have a black bourgeois heart and shout that the General Line, the Great Leap Forward are "bragging" and "wishful thinking," which is a malicious attack. We have not forgotten that in 1959, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists shouted this way; in 1961, when our country encountered temporary difficulties, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries also shouted this way; domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and other demons and monsters also shouted this way. Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are singing the same tune as the right-leaning opportunists and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. They are sitting on the same bench and wearing the same pants as imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Their loud shouts and troublemaking are nothing but a vain attempt to confuse the masses, provoke the relationship between the masses and the Party, and carry out capitalist restoration. This is something we can never tolerate! Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and all working people will adhere to the socialist direction, persist in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, overthrow all demons and monsters, and eliminate all pests.
    The members of our Gucheng Brigade say it well: "Water has its source, trees have their roots; we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to turn ourselves around." Without the leadership of the Party, without the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, there would be no Gucheng today. For a thousand, ten thousand generations, we will never forget the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Before liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants of our Gucheng Bay suffered from the exploitation and oppression of the Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Hongkui bandit gangs and the landlords and rich peasants. We suffered the hardships of cattle and horses and ate the food of pigs and dogs. The conscription of soldiers and collection of funds, the collection of rent and grain, forced us to separate from our wives and children, and our families were destroyed. After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, and we saw the light of day and turned ourselves around. However, our Gucheng's foundation was too weak in the past. In the first few years after liberation, in a good year, the entire brigade could produce a maximum of six to seven hundred thousand catties of grain, and we had to rely on the state to supply us with a portion of our food grain every year. 1958 was a year we will never forget. In that year, under the brilliant light of the General Line, we established the People's Commune and launched a struggle against saline-alkali land and floods. After eight years of arduous struggle, we built more than two hundred large and small canals and drainage ditches, and raised the low-lying lake fields by an average of four to five inches, and now more than two thousand five hundred acres have been turned into garden fields. Last year, our brigade planted more than one thousand two hundred acres of wheat, with an average yield of more than five hundred sixty catties per mu, and more than seven hundred acres of single-season rice, with a yield of more than one thousand catties per mu, and the highest yield reached more than one thousand four hundred catties per mu. In the past, we had no fishery here, but now we have a fish pond of more than one hundred sixty acres, and we have already harvested more than six thousand catties of fish this year. In the past, we had no forestry here, but now we have more than five hundred acres of forest. In the past, we had never raised sheep here, but now the whole brigade raises more than six hundred sheep. In the past, the elderly did not know what electricity was for generations, but now, not only threshing uses electricity, but grain processing also uses electricity. Our contribution to the country is getting bigger and bigger, and the lives of the members have been greatly improved. These are the results of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, and these are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought! Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light and enjoys high prestige among the poor and lower-middle peasants. The General Line and the Great Leap Forward have taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in our hearts. No matter what kind of black wind Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements stir up, they cannot blow it away!
    Chairman Mao said: "If the enemy opposes us vigorously and speaks of us as being utterly worthless, then that is even better, because it proves that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy, but also that our work is very successful."
    Deng Tuo and his gang of vicious enemies frantically attack our Party, which proves that our Party is a glorious, great, and correct Party! Their slander of our General Line and Great Leap Forward proves that we are doing the right thing and doing it well!
    Our struggle with Deng Tuo and his gang of demons and monsters is a life-and-death class struggle. The cadres and members of our Gucheng Brigade have all resolutely stated: we must be vanguards in the socialist cultural revolution, resolutely defend socialism, and resolutely fight to the end against all anti-Party and anti-socialist demons and monsters! No matter how "authoritative" you are, as long as you dare to oppose the Party and socialism, we will resolutely overthrow you. This is the greatest power and the greatest prestige that Chairman Mao has given us! We are not afraid of you wielding pens, going around in circles, speaking black words, stirring up black winds, and playing conspiracies. The great Mao Zedong Thought is a demon-revealing mirror; any demon or monster will reveal its true form when it is shone upon. Now Deng Tuo and his gang cannot escape, and they only have one way out: to surrender to the people.

    坚持阶级斗争　打倒牛鬼蛇神
    伟大的毛泽东思想是照妖镜，任何牛鬼蛇神，经它一照就现原形
    全国大寨式农业典型、宁夏吴忠县古城大队支部书记　莘长智
    邓拓、吴晗这一小撮人，开黑店，写黑书，说黑话，反党反社会主义，这实在令人气愤！告诉你们，你们想挖掉社会主义的墙脚，实行资本主义复辟，这一万个办不到！你们反党反社会主义，我们就要坚决地批判。现在你们的狐狸尾巴已经叫我们抓住了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！我们非把你们斗臭斗垮不可，一定连根拔掉你们反党反社会主义的黑线，彻底摧毁“三家村”黑店！
    邓拓、吴晗这伙子人，就是毛主席说的那些不拿枪的敌人。他们长了一颗资产阶级黑心，叫喊什么总路线、大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“想入非非”，这是恶毒的攻击。我们并没有忘记，一九五九年，就有一小撮右倾机会主义分子这样叫喊过；一九六一年当我们国家遇到暂时困难的时候，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，也这样喊叫过；国内的地富反坏右以及其他牛鬼蛇神也这样喊叫过。邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子就是跟右倾机会主义分子和地富反坏一个鼻孔出气的，就是跟帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派坐一条板凳、穿一条裤子的。他们大喊大叫，兴风作浪，无非是妄想迷惑群众，挑拨群众和党的关系，搞资本主义复辟，这是我们万万不能容忍的！我们广大贫农下中农和一切劳动人民在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，坚持社会主义方向，坚持阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，加强无产阶级专政，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，扫除一切害人虫。
    我们古城大队的社员说得好：“水有源，树有根，我们是靠毛泽东思想翻的身。”没有党的领导，没有总路线、大跃进和人民公社，就没有古城的今天。我们千辈子，万辈子，也忘不了共产党和毛主席的恩情。解放前，我们古城湾的贫农下中农，受尽了蒋介石、马鸿逵匪帮和地主、富农的剥削压迫，受的是牛马苦，吃的是猪狗食。抓兵派款，收租要粮，逼得我们妻离子散，家破人亡。解放了，共产党和毛主席来了，我们才见了天日，翻了身。可是过去我们古城的家底太薄了，刚解放的头几年，碰上个好年成，全大队一年顶多能打上六七十万斤粮食，年年还得靠国家供应我们一部分口粮。一九五八年是我们永远难忘的一年。这一年，我们在总路线光辉的照耀下，办起了人民公社，和盐碱、洪水展开了斗争。经过八年的艰苦奋斗，我们修了二百多条大小渠道和排水沟，把成千亩的低洼湖田平均垫高了四五寸，现在已经有两千五百多亩实现了园田化。去年我们大队种了一千二百多亩小麦，平均亩产五百六十多斤，七百多亩单季稻，亩产突破了千斤大关，最高的亩产达到了一千四百多斤。过去我们这里没有渔业，现在有了一个一百六十多亩大的养鱼池，今年已经收了六千多斤鱼。过去我们这里没有林业，现在有了五百多亩林木。过去我们这里没有养过羊，现在全大队养了六百多只羊。过去老人几辈子不知道啥叫电，现在，不但打场用上了电，粮食加工也用上了电。我们对国家的贡献越来越大，社员生活大大提高。这都是总路线、大跃进的成果，这都是毛泽东思想的胜利！毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯，在贫下中农中享有崇高威信。总路线、大跃进在我们心里扎了根，开了花，结了果，不管你邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义分子刮什么样的黑风也是刮不掉的！
    毛主席说：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    邓拓这帮凶恶的敌人，疯狂地攻击我们党，就证明我们的党是光荣的党，伟大的党，正确的党！它污蔑我们的总路线、大跃进，就正说明我们做得对，做得好！
    我们和邓拓这伙子牛鬼蛇神的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。我们古城大队的干部和社员都坚决表示：要在社会主义文化大革命中打先锋，坚决保卫社会主义，坚决和一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神斗争到底！管你什么“权威”不“权威”，只要你们胆敢反党反社会主义，我们就坚决斗倒你们。这就是毛主席给我们的最大的权，最大的威！你们摇笔杆子，绕弯子，说黑话，刮黑风，耍阴谋，我们不怕。伟大的毛泽东思想是照妖镜，任何牛鬼蛇神，经它一照就现原形。现在邓拓一伙已经逃不脱了，只有向人民缴械投降一条路。
