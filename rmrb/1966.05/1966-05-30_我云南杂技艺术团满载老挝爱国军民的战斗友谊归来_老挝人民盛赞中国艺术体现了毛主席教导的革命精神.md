    According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Kang Kai, May 29th, the Chinese Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe recently concluded a two-month-plus performance tour in the Lao liberated areas and has returned to China fully laden with the combat friendship of Lao patriotic armymen and civilians. According to a broadcast by the Voice of Laos radio station, cadres and soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army praised the acrobatic troupe's performance as "embodying the brave and resolute spirit of the Chinese army and people under the revolutionary thought education of Chairman Mao Zedong, and embodying their spirit of carrying the revolution through to the end."
    The Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe is the first Chinese artistic troupe sent to the Lao liberated areas for a performance tour. They performed a total of thirty-two shows in Kang Kai, Chuan Kuang, and the Phou Kout region, with an audience of over 15,000. Carrying forward the fighting spirit of the "Ulanmuqi," they frequently braved the danger of bombing and strafing by American planes, carrying their props on their backs, crossing mountains and ridges, and going deep into the frontlines of the troops, remote villages, and hospitals for wounded soldiers to perform. Many people living in enemy-occupied areas also crossed enemy blockades to watch.
    During the visit and performance tour, Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee Representative Nouhak Phoumsavan, Lao People's Liberation Army Supreme Command Representatives Phoun Sipaseuth and Singapo Sikhotchounnamaly, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao National Union Government Kham Souk Keola, State Secretary of National Economy and Planning Khamphèng Boupha, Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces Colonel Deuane, and others watched their performances and successively received members of the acrobatic troupe. They praised the acrobatic troupe members' fighting spirit and brilliant performances.
    Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee Representative Nouhak Phoumsavan said: The acrobatic troupe brought the revolutionary friendship of the Chinese people to the Lao liberated areas, which demonstrates the great proletarian internationalist spirit of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people. He said that the acrobatic troupe's visit and performance tour greatly encouraged the fighting will of the Lao patriotic armymen and civilians.
    Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao National Union Government Kham Souk Keola said: "The Chinese people sending an acrobatic troupe to Laos for a visit and performance tour has greatly supported our struggle against America for national salvation." Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces Colonel Deuane wrote in the guestbook that you brought the hearts of the 650 million Chinese people to the Lao people. This is an embodiment of the internationalist spirit of the Chinese people advancing on the bright road of Marxism-Leninism under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The Lao people express their sincere gratitude to Chairman Mao Zedong.

    我云南杂技艺术团满载老挝爱国军民的战斗友谊归来
    老挝人民盛赞中国艺术体现了毛主席教导的革命精神
    据新华社康开二十九日电  中国云南杂技艺术团最近在老挝解放区进行了两个多月的访问演出，已满载着老挝爱国军民的战斗友谊离开老挝回国。据老挝之声电台广播，老挝人民解放军干部和战士赞扬这个杂技团的演出“体现了在毛泽东主席的革命思想教育下的中国军队和人民所具有的勇敢和坚决精神，体现了他们把革命进行到底的精神”。
    云南杂技艺术团是中国人民第一个派到老挝解放区进行访问演出的艺术团体。他们在康开、川圹和富科特山等地共演出了三十二场，观众达一万五千多人次。他们发扬“乌兰牧骑”的战斗精神，经常冒着美国飞机轰炸扫射的危险，身背道具，翻山越岭，深入到部队的阵地、偏僻的村庄和伤病员的医院去进行演出。还有很多住在敌占区的群众也穿过敌人封锁线前来观看。
    在访问演出期间，老挝爱国战线党中央代表诺哈·冯沙万，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表奔·西巴色、辛加坡，老挝三方面民族团结政府卫生大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉，国民经济和计划国务秘书坎芬·杜纳龙，老挝爱国中立力量总指挥敦上校等观看了他们的演出，并且先后接见了杂技团人员。他们赞扬杂技团人员的战斗精神和精采演出。
    老挝爱国战线党中央代表诺哈·冯沙万说：杂技团带着中国人民对老挝人民的革命友情来到了老挝解放区，这显示了中国共产党、毛泽东主席和中国人民的伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神。他说，杂技团的访问演出，大大鼓舞了老挝爱国军民的斗争意志。
    老挝民族团结政府卫生大臣兼代理外交大臣坎苏·高拉说：“中国人民派杂技艺术团到老挝访问演出，极大地支持了我们的抗美救国斗争。”老挝爱国中立力量总指挥敦上校在留言簿上写道，你们给老挝人民带来了六亿五千万中国人民的心意，这是在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下的在马克思列宁主义光明大道上前进的中国人民国际主义精神的体现。老挝人民对毛泽东主席表示真挚的感谢。
