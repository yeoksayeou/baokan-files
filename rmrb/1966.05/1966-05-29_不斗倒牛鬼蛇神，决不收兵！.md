    We will not withdraw our troops until the demons and monsters are defeated!
    Liberation Army Unit Commander Dong Guangji
    The film "Red Sun" is a poisonous weed that praises the Kuomintang reactionary army, "erects monuments" and "writes biographies" for the enemy's 74th Division, and eulogizes Zhang Lingfu, a butcher who slaughtered the people. From beginning to end, the film depicts the desperately struggling enemy army as "mighty and majestic" and "unyielding," walking with "high spirits and great strides," and fighting with "bravery and skill." Zhang Lingfu is even more beautified, described as "calm and good at fighting," "talented and ambitious," and "unyielding." In the minds of the writers and directors, this butcher with blood on his hands becomes a "peerless hero." After he was killed by our army, the film immediately shows a red sun, using this to praise Zhang Lingfu's reactionary soul as "eternally immortal."
    Was the Kuomintang's 74th Division really so invincible? No! Absolutely not. From the beginning of the War of Liberation, we dealt with Zhang Lingfu's 74th Division, and we knew Zhang Lingfu's background like the back of our hand. Until he was killed by our army, we clashed with him five or six times in Qingjiang, Lianshui, Xin'an, and other places. What kind of unit was this trump card division that called itself the "Iron Army"? They were paper tigers through and through. At the time, the Kuomintang believed that Zhang Lingfu's best tactic was his so-called "outflanking tactic." But in reality, it was a "death wish tactic." Before the Lianshui defense battle, Zhang Lingfu used a reinforced battalion to outflank near Qingjiang, but was surrounded by our army and suffered a severe blow. During the Lianshui campaign, Zhang Lingfu initially seemed crazy, relying on his planes and cannons. However, when it came to close combat, they all turned into cowards. In the ten days and nights of battle, the unit I was in annihilated more than 4,000 of them. Through this battle, we not only boosted the morale of our army's commanders and fighters and improved our equipment, but also encouraged the enthusiasm of the people in the liberated areas, and severely hit the arrogance of the enemy army, which determined Zhang Lingfu's fate of being killed in Menglianggu. As Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "Greeting the New High Tide of the Chinese Revolution": "In recent battles in northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, western Shandong, and western Shanxi, the morale of many Chiang Kai-shek troops has declined to a great extent. Our army has begun to seize the initiative on several battlefields, while the Chiang Kai-shek army has begun to lose the initiative."
    In order to completely smash the enemy army, we decided to carry out a prepared and planned strategic shift, and actively withdrew from Lianshui. At that time, every commander and fighter in our army understood the intentions of the superiors, so morale was very high. On the march away from Lianshui, we also fought a great victory! That was on January 18, 1947, when we advanced to near Xin'an, Zhang Lingfu once again used his "outflanking tactic," ordering a reinforced company to outflank Xin'an Town in an attempt to eliminate us there. However, because all our commanders and fighters were brave and tenacious, not afraid of sacrifice, and displayed the fighting style of continuous operations, we did not even catch our breath before fighting the enemy, and the enemy company was completely annihilated by us. Zhang Lingfu was like a frightened bird at this time, and no matter how he struggled, he could not escape his fate of death. However, the film's writers and directors portrayed Zhang Lingfu, this defeated general, as a "remarkable hero," openly gilding and powdering Zhang Lingfu's face, erecting monuments and writing biographies for him. It's simply infuriating and hateful!
    We resolutely do not allow this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs to distort the history that we dyed red with blood. We must fight to the end with this gang of demons and monsters who oppose Mao Zedong Thought and serve the reactionary classes. We will not withdraw our troops until we have won a complete victory!

    不斗倒牛鬼蛇神，决不收兵！
    解放军某部师长　董光继
    影片《红日》是歌颂国民党反动军队，为敌七十四师
  “树碑”“立传”，为屠杀人民的刽子手张灵甫歌功颂德的毒草。影片从头到尾，把垂死挣扎的敌军描写成“威武雄壮”、“顽强不屈”，走起路来“雄赳赳，气昂昂”，打起仗来“英勇善战”。对于张灵甫更是竭力美化，什么“沉着善战”呀，“雄才大略”呀，“顽强不屈”呀，在编导者的心目中，这个双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手，成了“盖世英雄”。在他被我军击毙之后，影片还立刻出现一轮红日，以此来歌颂张灵甫的反动灵魂“永垂不朽”。
    国民党七十四师真的是这样不可一世吗？不！完全不是。我们从解放战争一开始，就和张灵甫的七十四师打交道，对于张灵甫的老底子是了如指掌的。直到他被我军击毙为止，我们和他在清江、涟水、新安等地交锋过五、六次。这支号称“铁军”的王牌师，究竟怎样呢？他们是地地道道的纸老虎。当时，国民党认为张灵甫最拿手的战术，是他的所谓“迂回战术”。但实际上是“送命战术”。涟水保卫战之前，张灵甫用了一个加强营的兵力，迂回到清江附近，结果被我军围困起来，受到了我军的严重打击。涟水战役中，起初，张灵甫依仗他的飞机大炮，看来比较疯狂。但是，一到短兵相接时，他们就都变成了狗熊。我所在的一个单位在十天十夜的战斗中，就歼灭了他们四千余人。通过这次战斗，不仅鼓舞了我军指战员的士气，改善了我们的装备，鼓舞了解放区人民的情绪，而且，严重地打击了敌军的气焰，决定了张灵甫在孟良崮就毙的命运。正如毛主席在《迎接中国革命的新高潮》一文中指出的：“最近在苏北、鲁南、鲁西、晋西等地几次作战中，许多蒋军部队士气的下降已到了很大的程度。我军已在几个战场上开始夺取了主动，蒋军则开始失去了主动。”
    我们为了彻底粉碎敌军，决定进行一次有准备、有计划的战略转移，主动地撤离了涟水。当时，我军每个指战员都明白上级意图，所以士气非常足。在离开涟水的行军途中，还打了一次大胜仗呢！那是一九四七年一月十八日，当我们前进到新安附近时，张灵甫又施展他那“迂回战术”，命令一个加强连，迂回到新安镇，企图把我们消灭在那里。但是，由于我们全体指战员英勇顽强，不怕牺牲，发扬了连续作战的战斗作风，气都没有喘，就和敌人打起来，敌人一个连全部被我歼灭。张灵甫这时犹如惊弓之鸟，怎么挣扎，也摆脱不了他死亡的命运。但是，影片编导者却把张灵甫这个败将写成了“赫赫英雄”，明目张胆地往张灵甫脸上贴金、抹粉，为他树碑立传，简直可气，可恨！
    我们坚决不容许这伙反党反社会主义黑帮歪曲我们用鲜血染红的历史，我们一定要与这伙反对毛泽东思想、为反动阶级效劳的牛鬼蛇神斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
