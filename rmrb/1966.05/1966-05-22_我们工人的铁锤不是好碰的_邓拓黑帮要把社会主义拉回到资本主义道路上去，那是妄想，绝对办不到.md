    Our workers' hammers are not to be trifled with.
    Deng Tuo black gang's attempt to drag socialism back to the capitalist road is a delusion and will absolutely not succeed.
    Ma Hengchang, National People's Congress Representative and Chief Mechanical Engineer of Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant
    After reading Deng Tuo's counter-Party and anti-socialist black language, I felt extremely angry. They slandered our Great Leap Forward, saying that our Party only "brags" and "speaks big words," and "smashed their heads against the wall" in the face of facts. We want to ask Deng Tuo, did Dazhai's fields, Daqing's oil, and the atomic bomb fall from the sky? Everyone knows that whether it is Dazhai, Daqing, or the three nuclear explosions, they were all achieved by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the General Line! Why do you put these aside and dare not even look at them? This is nothing else; it is because you are anti-Party and anti-socialist to the core.
    In order to refute your slander against the Great Leap Forward, I will give you a rundown of our factory's production situation: When we were first liberated, the enemy only left behind a pile of scrap in our factory. Later, we rebuilt a machine tool plant in the wilderness. After several years of hard struggle, we finally developed from being able to produce only a few dozen machines a year to now being able to produce thousands of machine tools a year. The products produced by our factory have not only reached advanced domestic levels, but some have even caught up with or surpassed advanced world levels. Especially during the period when you were attacking most frantically, our working class was not intimidated by the continuous three years of natural disasters, and even less did we let modern revisionism strangle our necks. Our workers demonstrated the strongest revolutionary spirit, relying not on heaven, not on earth, but only on our own hands, following Chairman Mao's instructions, taking our own path, and running Chinese-style socialist enterprises. Are these all "bragging" and "speaking big words"? I tell you, Deng Tuo, your attempt to drag socialism back to the capitalist road is a delusion and will absolutely not succeed! Our workers' hammers are not to be trifled with!
    Here, I also want to question "Qianxian," "Beijing Ribao," and "Beijing Wanbao." In recent years, you have been spreading revisionist poison under the banner of Party journals and newspapers; you have also tried your best to shield Deng Tuo and his gang, to cover for them, to serve the bourgeoisie, and to turn Party journals and newspapers into tools against the Party and against socialism. This is something we will never allow.

### 我们工人的铁锤不是好碰的  邓拓黑帮要把社会主义拉回到资本主义道路上去，那是妄想，绝对办不到

    我们工人的铁锤不是好碰的
    邓拓黑帮要把社会主义拉回到资本主义道路上去，那是妄想，绝对办不到
    全国人民代表大会代表齐齐哈尔第二机床厂总机械师  马恒昌
    看了邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话，心里万分气愤。他们诬蔑我们的大跃进，说我们党只会“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”。我们要责问邓拓，大寨的田、大庆的石油、原子弹都是从天上掉下来的吗？谁都知道，不论是大寨也好，大庆也好，还是三次核爆炸也好，都是全国人民在党中央和毛主席领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下取得的！你们为什么把这些都放在一边，连看都不敢看呢？这不是别的，这是因为你们从骨子里就是反党反社会主义的。
    为了驳斥你们对大跃进的诬蔑，我再给你们摆一摆我们工厂的生产情况：刚解放时，我们厂里，敌人只留下了一堆破烂，后来我们在荒野上重新建起了一座机床厂，经过了几年的艰苦奋斗，终于由一年仅能生产几十台机器，发展到现在一年能生产上千台机床。我们厂出的产品，不仅达到了国内先进水平，有的已经赶上或超过了世界先进水平。特别是在你们攻击得最疯狂的时期，我们工人阶级没有被当时连续三年自然灾害所吓倒，更没有让现代修正主义卡住我们的脖子，我们工人表现了最坚强的革命精神，不靠天，不靠地，只靠自己的双手，按着毛主席的指示，走自己的路，办起了中国式的社会主义企业。这些难道都是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？告诉你邓拓，你们要把社会主义拉回到资本主义道路上去，那是妄想，绝对办不到！我们工人的铁锤不是好碰的！
    在这里，我还要责问《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》，这些年来你们打着党刊党报的旗号，散布修正主义毒素；还极力包庇邓拓这一伙黑帮，为他们打掩护，为资产阶级效劳，把党刊党报变成反党反社会主义的工具，这是我们决不允许的。
