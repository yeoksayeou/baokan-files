    Excerpts from Submitted Articles

    Deng Tuo slandered workers, peasants, and soldiers as having "shallow knowledge but a fondness for nitpicking." Do workers, peasants, and soldiers really have "shallow knowledge"? We workers, peasants, and soldiers certainly do not possess the decadent "knowledge" of your capitalism and feudalism, but we have the knowledge of the proletariat, the knowledge of class struggle, the knowledge of production struggle, and the knowledge of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. People like Deng Tuo, so-called "scholars," think that by using history, stories, and knowledge as a smokescreen, workers, peasants, and soldiers can be fooled and deceived, allowing them to wildly oppose the Party and socialism. However, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, through the alluring phenomena, see through their reactionary essence, tear down the deceptive smokescreen, and expose the true forms of demons and monsters. This shows that in the struggle against class enemies, workers, peasants, and soldiers are not "shallow in knowledge" but "deep in knowledge." Deng Tuo and his gang oppose our "nitpicking" because they are afraid of our "nitpicking." Therefore, we must "fondly nitpick," and as soon as any demons and monsters wearing the cloak of so-called "scholars" emerge, we must "nitpick" them out and not let them stir up trouble.

    Deng Tuo shouted about "being masters of ourselves, not slaves." Look at him! He follows behind American imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, barking madly at the Party and socialism. Khrushchev revisionism slandered the Chinese people for drinking "plain water soup," and Deng Tuo said, "Plain boiled water is the best to drink." Khrushchev revisionism said it exposed the "dogmatic theory of the competition between the East Wind and the West Wind," and Deng Tuo attacked, saying that "East Wind" and "West Wind" are both "clichés" and "grand empty talk"... The Chinese people, who listen to the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, are the most unyielding. No matter what the situation, they dare to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. Only people like Deng Tuo grow into a slave's face, say a slave's words, and do a slave's deeds.

    邓拓诬蔑工农兵“学问不深而性好挑剔”，工农兵真的“学问”不深吗？我们工农兵确实没有你们那些资本主义、封建主义的腐朽的“学问”，但是我们有无产阶级的学问，有阶级斗争的学问，有生产斗争的学问，有活学活用毛主席著作的学问。邓拓之流的所谓“学者”，以为用谈历史、讲故事、传知识作幌子，工农兵就可以受蒙蔽，被欺骗了，他们就可以大肆反党反社会主义了。可是工农兵广大群众透过迷人的现象，看透了他们反动的本质，揭开了骗人的幌子，暴露了牛鬼蛇神的原形。这说明在同阶级敌人斗争中，工农兵不是“学问不深”，而是“学问很深”。邓拓一伙反对我们“挑剔”，是因为他们害怕我们“挑剔”。因此，我们就得“性好挑剔”，一切披着所谓“学者”外衣的牛鬼蛇神一出笼，就把它“挑剔”出来，不让它兴风作浪。

    邓拓叫嚷什么要“自做主人，不做奴才”。看看他自己吧！他跟在美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的后面，对党和社会主义狂吠。赫鲁晓夫修正主义诬蔑中国人民喝“大锅清水汤”，邓拓就说什么“白开水最好喝”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义说什么揭露“东风和西风竞争的教条理论”，邓拓就攻击说“东风”、“西风”都是“陈词滥调”、“伟大的空话”……。我们听党的话、听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事的中国人民是最有骨气的，不管在什么情况下，都敢于同帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行针锋相对的斗争。只有邓拓之流才长成一副奴才相，说的奴才话，干的奴才事。
