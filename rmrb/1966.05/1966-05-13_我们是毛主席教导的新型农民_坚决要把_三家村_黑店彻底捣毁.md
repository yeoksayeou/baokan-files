    We are new-style farmers taught by Chairman Mao
    Determined to thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" black den
    Chen Yonggui, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch
    When I saw the newspaper and heard the radio, knowing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo and a small handful of people, I became increasingly angry the more I read, and the more I listened, the more infuriated I became. My heart was about to jump out, and I could no longer hold back my words. You keepers and lackeys of the "Three-Family Village" black den, I want to ask you: you eat the people's food every day, why do you specialize in doing things against the people? I warn you bad guys, we Dazhai people and the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country steadfastly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we must wipe out the anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous snakes, and remove all the poisonous weeds; we must defend the Party's leadership, defend the socialist country, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    Deng Tuo viciously attacked Chairman Mao's scientific thesis about "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind," serving Khrushchev revisionism and imperialism, and being an enemy of the revolutionary people of the world. Deng Tuo, I want to ask you: you fabricated a poem written by a child, saying that "East Wind, West Wind" are "great empty words," who are you attacking? Even though you used the trick of beating around the bush, we are very clear. Our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis about the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind pointed out a bright future for the people of the world, and gave the revolutionary people of the world great encouragement. Precisely because of this, imperialism and modern revisionism, as well as all reactionaries, are terrified of this thesis, hate it to the bone, and slander it in every way. You attack "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind" just like them, serving Khrushchev revisionism and imperialism, opposing the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and being an enemy of the Chinese and world people. You viciously attack our revolutionary leader, and this is conducting counter-revolutionary activities. Deng Tuo, I tell you: we workers, peasants, and soldiers will never be lenient towards all anti-Party, anti-socialist, and counter-revolutionary statements and actions. You attack our great leader, not only will the Chinese people not forgive you, but the revolutionary people of the world will not forgive you either.
    Deng Tuo, you also use ancient things to satirize the present, scolding our Party for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." This is telling blatant lies. You actually wear the same pair of pants as modern revisionists; you are completely the same kind of stuff as Khrushchev and Tito. Your madly scolding the Party will not damage our great Party by a single hair, but your anti-Party and anti-socialist tail has been exposed. You say our Party is "self-righteous" and "looks down on the masses"; I say our Party is the most humble, the most prudent, and the most respectful of the masses. We speak with facts. We clearly remember Chairman Mao teaching us in his works to be humble and prudent, to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, teaching us the principle that "modesty helps one progress, arrogance makes one lag behind," teaching us to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and adhere to the mass line working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses. Our vast numbers of Party members and cadres act in accordance with this instruction. I ask Deng Tuo and his gang, in our Party's various guidelines and policies, can you point out which one was not formulated through the mass line working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses? Which one does not represent the interests of the broad masses of people? After Dazhai suffered a flood in 1963, Party and government leaders at all levels sent delegations to express sympathy and provide relief. In 1965, Premier Zhou himself came to Dazhai to visit and give guidance. The words "self-righteous and looking down on the masses" can only be used for emperors, generals, and feudal rulers, plus you lot of bourgeois intellectuals who are physically lazy and cannot distinguish the five grains. You shut yourselves in rooms to write articles and plays, opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing the people; you are the ones who are self-righteous and look down on the masses.
    Deng Tuo, you scold us for implementing the Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "telling big lies," and "bumping our heads and bleeding in the face of facts." I say, it is not we workers, peasants, and soldiers who adhere to the Great Leap Forward who are bumping our heads and bleeding in the face of facts, but a small handful of you who oppose the Great Leap Forward. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward cannot be obliterated by your few bald pens. Take Dazhai for example: since 1958, because we have always held high the red banner of the General Line and relied on the superiority of the people's commune, we Dazhai have realized the Great Leap Forward, and earth-shaking changes have taken place. Grain production, which was only more than 300 jin per mu in 1957, reached more than 800 jin in 1964. In 1965, this place suffered a major drought of 150 days, and the yield per mu still reached 796 jin. Isn't this still a Great Leap Forward? Is this bragging? In 1961, we made a ten-year plan to build a semi-new countryside by 1970, but thanks to the illumination of the General Line lighthouse, we implemented more, faster, better, and more economical methods, and in less than two years, we built a new Dazhai with "rows of new caves, rows of houses, electric lights upstairs and downstairs, machines rumbling loudly, and tap water delivered to the door," and more than 70% of the commune members' families moved into new houses and new caves. In fact, there is more than one Dazhai in our country; our Dazhai is just one of the millions of new villages in the country. Chairman Mao taught us: "If the enemy opposes us vigorously and says we are a complete mess and have nothing good, then that is even better, because it proves that we have not only drawn a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, but also proves that our work is very successful." Deng Tuo, your gang frantically scolds our Great Leap Forward, which just proves that our Great Leap Forward has achieved brilliant results. You want to stop us from advancing, that is "a mantis trying to stop a chariot," and you will inevitably be crushed to pieces by the wheels of the Great Leap Forward.
    You guys from the "Three-Family Village" black den, you scold us for being "hegemonic" and "unpopular,"妄想推翻无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。wanting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and realize capitalist restoration. We want to tell you solemnly, we will exercise "hegemony" and dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and over you monsters and demons, and we are not willing to gain your "hearts." If we don't exercise dictatorship over you anti-Party and anti-socialist guys, where would Dazhai be, where would Daqing be, where would socialism be!
    Deng Tuo is a genuine careerist. He actually clamored wildly for our Party to step down "to rest" quickly, "not to say anything," and "not to do anything." Isn't this trying to remove our savior and eliminate the root of our lives? Dear poor and lower-middle peasant class brothers, everyone think about it, we were all saved from the suffering of the old society by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Before liberation, we begged for tea and food, our wives and children were scattered, and we lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Take my family for example, at that time, all five members of my family were tortured by those man-eating landlords, leaving only me, and the others were forced to death by the landlords. Today, if we let Deng Tuo shout and clamor for the Party to step down "to rest," then who would take the stage? Wouldn't it still be the past and present landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all monsters and demons? This is something we absolutely cannot allow!
    I also want to question the editorial departments of *Frontline*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News*, in the past you wholeheartedly served as tools for Deng Tuo's gang to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, releasing poisonous weeds and poisonous arrows, and now that the true colors of the "Three-Family Village" have been revealed, you are using "deceiving the heavens and crossing the sea" and "stratagems of setting up empty cities," releasing smoke screens, and covering up Deng Tuo's gang's escape. Tell you: no way, not to mention thirty-six stratagems, even seventy-two stratagems cannot deceive us, Deng Tuo cannot escape, and neither can you. Whoever supports Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han's anti-Party clique, we will settle accounts with them; whoever wants to cover them up, we will grab them and fight them.
    The newspaper can only be controlled by our Party and serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must stand up to protect this front; we must resolutely take back what has been taken away by anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.
    Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, they will inevitably fight us to the death, and we must not underestimate these enemies." We have firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, and we have never put down the weapon of class struggle for a moment. We are new-style farmers led by the Party and Chairman Mao, we have read Chairman Mao's books, our awareness has been raised, our eyes have been sharpened, and we can see through any monsters and demons. The attempt of the "Three-Family Village" gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements will never be achieved. Socialism is a steel-reinforced iron country, and you cannot move even half a brick even if you try for ten thousand years. The fire you lit yourselves has now burned onto your own bodies and will burn all of you poisonous weeds to ashes.

### 我们是毛主席教导的新型农民  坚决要把“三家村”黑店彻底捣毁

    我们是毛主席教导的新型农民
    坚决要把“三家村”黑店彻底捣毁
    全国人民代表大会代表大寨大队党支部书记  陈永贵
    当我看到报纸，听到广播，知道邓拓、吴晗一小撮人的反党反社会主义的罪行以后，真是越看越生气，越听越起火。我的心快要跳出来了，我的话在肚里憋不住了。“三家村”黑店的掌柜和伙计们，我要质问你们：你们每天吃的是人民的茶饭，为什么专门干反人民的勾当？我警告你们这些坏家伙，我们大寨人和全国工农兵群众坚定不移地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一定要把反党反社会主义的毒蛇消灭干净，把所有的毒草除掉；一定要捍卫党的领导，捍卫社会主义江山，捍卫无产阶级专政。
    邓拓恶毒地攻击毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的科学论断，是为赫鲁晓夫修正主义效劳，为帝国主义效劳，与全世界革命人民为敌。邓拓，我要问你：你编造了一个孩子写的诗，把“东风、西风”说成是“伟大的空话”，你是在攻击谁呢？尽管你用的是指桑骂槐的鬼办法，可是，我们是很清楚的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席关于东风压倒西风的英明论断，给全世界人民指出了光明前途，给全世界革命人民以极大的鼓舞。正因为这样，帝国主义和现代修正主义以及一切反动派，对这个论断害怕得要死，恨之入骨，百般谩骂。你和他们一样攻击“东风压倒西风”，就是为赫鲁晓夫修正主义效劳，为帝国主义效劳，就是反对中国人民和世界人民的革命斗争，与中国和世界人民为敌。你恶毒地攻击我们的革命领袖，这就是进行反革命的勾当。邓拓，我告诉你：我们工农兵群众对一切反党反社会主义反革命的言论和行动，是绝不留情的。你攻击我们的伟大领袖，不仅中国人民不能饶恕你，就是全世界革命人民也不能饶恕你。
    邓拓，你还借古讽今，骂我党是“自作聪明，看不起群众”。这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。你竟和现代修正主义者穿一条连裆裤子，你跟赫鲁晓夫、铁托完全是一样货色。你这样疯狂地骂党，对我们伟大的党来说，损失不了一根毫毛，可是你的反党反社会主义的尾巴却露了出来。你说我们党“自作聪明”“看不起群众”；我说我们党最谦虚最谨慎最看得起群众。我们是用事实说话的。我们清楚地记得毛主席在他的著作中，教导我们要谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，教导我们“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的道理，教导我们要相信群众依靠群众，坚持从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线的工作方法。我们广大党员和干部就是按照这个指示办事的。试问邓拓一伙，在我党的各项方针政策中，你们能拿出哪一条哪一款不是通过从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线工作方法制订出来的？哪一条哪一款不是代表广大人民群众的利益的？一九六三年大寨遭受洪灾以后，各级党政领导都派代表团来慰问救济。一九六五年，周总理亲自来大寨访问、指导。“自作聪明，看不起群众”的字眼，只能用于帝王将相封建统治者，再加上你们这一伙四肢不勤、五谷不分的资产阶级知识分子老爷们。你们关在房里写文章、编剧本，反党反社会主义反人民，才是自作聪明，才是看不起群众。
    邓拓，你们骂我们实行大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，“在事实面前，碰得头破血流”。我说，在事实面前碰得头破血流的不是我们坚持大跃进的工农兵群众，而是你们反对大跃进的一小撮人。大跃进的成果，是你们那几杆秃笔抹煞不了的。就拿大寨来说吧：一九五八年以来，由于我们一直高举总路线的红旗，依靠人民公社的优越性，我们大寨实现了大跃进，起了翻天覆地的变化。粮食产量，一九五七年亩产才三百多斤，到一九六四年就达到八百多斤。一九六五年这里遭受了一百五十天大旱，亩产还达七百九十六斤。难道这还不是大跃进吗？难道这是吹牛皮吗？我们在一九六一年作出一个十年规划，计划到一九七○年建设个半新农村，可是由于有了总路线灯塔的照耀，实行了多快好省，没用两年工夫，就建成了一个“排排新窑排排房，楼上楼下电灯光，机器隆隆震天响，自来水管送门上”的新大寨，百分之七十以上的社员户住上了新房新窑。其实，我们国家那止一个大寨，我们大寨只不过是全国千百万个新农村中的一个。毛主席教导我们：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一蹋糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”邓拓，你们一伙疯狂地骂我们大跃进，正好证明了我们的大跃进取得了光辉的成绩。你们想阻挡我们前进，那是“螳臂当车”，非被大跃进的车轮压得粉身碎骨不可。
      “三家村”黑店的家伙们，你们骂我们“霸道”“不得人心”，是妄想推翻无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。我们要正告你们，我们对于地富反坏右，对于你们这些牛鬼蛇神就是要实行“霸道”，要专政，就是不愿得你们的“人心”。要是不对你们这些反党反社会主义的家伙实行专政，那里会有大寨，那里会有大庆，那里会有社会主义！
    邓拓是个货真价实的野心派。他竟然狂妄地叫喊要我们党赶快下台“休息”、“什么话都不要说”、“什么事都不要做”。这岂不是要摘掉我们的救星，除去我们的命根子吗？亲爱的贫下中农阶级弟兄们，大家都想想，我们都是中国共产党和毛主席从旧社会的苦难之中救出来的。在解放以前，我们讨茶要饭，妻离子散，过着牛马不如的生活。就拿我家来说吧，那时全家五口人被那些吃人的财主折磨得只留下我一个人，其他的人都是被地主逼死的。今天，如果让邓拓大喊大叫要党下台“休息”，那么上台的又是谁呢？还不是过去的和现在的地富反坏右和一切牛鬼蛇神吗？这是我们绝对不能允许的！
    我还要质问《前线》《北京日报》和《北京晚报》编辑部，你们过去死心塌地做邓拓一伙的反党反社会主义的工具，大放毒草，大放毒箭，现在“三家村”原形毕露了，你们又使用“瞒天过海”“疑兵计”，大放烟幕，掩护邓拓一伙逃跑。告诉你们：不行，莫说三十六计，就是七十二计也骗不了我们，跑不了邓拓，也跑不了你们。谁支持邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗这伙反党分子，我们就和谁算账；谁想掩护他们，我们就揪住谁斗争。
    报纸只能掌握在我们党手里，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。这块阵地，我们要起来保护；已经被反党反社会主义分子夺走了的，我们要坚决夺回来。
    毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”我们牢牢记住了毛主席的教导，我们一刻也没有放下阶级斗争这个武器。我们是党和毛主席领导的新型农民，读了毛主席的书，觉悟提高了，眼睛擦亮了，什么牛鬼蛇神我们也能看得出来。“三家村”一伙反党反社会主义分子的企图是永远不会达到的。社会主义是钢帮铁底铁江山，你们搬上一万年也搬不了一块半头砖。你们自己点起来的火，现在已烧到了你们自己的身上，将把你们这些毒草统统烧尽。
