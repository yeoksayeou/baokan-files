    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 26th – The 1966 National Spring Swimming Championships, held in Dongguan County, Guangdong, concluded today. Prior to the championships, athletes from various regions severely criticized Deng Tuo's gang for their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, expressing their determination to achieve excellent results and use facts to destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop, resolutely defending the great Mao Zedong Thought. During the five-day competition, seven athletes broke six national records from last year, with one equaling the highest national score so far this year. In addition, a juvenile relay team broke a national juvenile swimming record.
    The championships began on May 22nd. All athletes, coaches, and staff participating in the championships held a meeting on May 16th, severely condemning Deng Tuo's gang for their anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes. At the meeting, many outstanding athletes cited numerous facts to refute Deng Tuo's gang's attacks on the great Mao Zedong Thought and their slanders against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. After the meeting, each delegation put up blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, and wall newspapers, using the great achievements in China's sports to criticize Deng Tuo's gang and Mao Zedong's quotations to encourage themselves. Many athletes reviewed Mao Zedong's quotations before and after training and competitions, using Mao Zedong's words to examine and summarize their thoughts and drive.

    参加全国春季游泳赛的运动员
    严斥邓拓黑帮反党罪行
    新华社广州二十六日电  在广东东莞县举行的一九六六年全国春季游泳锦标赛今天结束。锦标赛前，各地选手严厉批判邓拓黑帮的反党反社会主义罪行，纷纷表示要创造好成绩，用事实来摧毁“三家村”黑店，坚决捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想。在五天的比赛中，有七名运动员打破了六项去年的全国纪录，其中一项平了今年以来的全国最高成绩。另外，有一个少年接力队打破了一项少年游泳全国纪录。
    锦标赛是从五月二十二日开始举行的。参加锦标赛的全体运动员、教练员和工作人员曾经在五月十六日举行了一次会议，严斥邓拓黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行。会上，许多优秀运动员列举了大量事实，驳斥邓拓黑帮对伟大的毛泽东思想的攻击和对总路线、大跃进、人民公社的污蔑。会后，各代表队纷纷出黑板报、大字报和墙报，用我国体育事业上的伟大成就来批驳邓拓黑帮，用毛主席语录来鼓舞自己。许多运动员在训练和比赛前后，都重温毛主席语录，用毛主席的话来检查和总结自己的思想和干劲。
    广东选手蒙荣乙在男子一百米蝶泳预赛和决赛中，先后以一分和五十九秒五的成绩，两次打破了一分○秒五的全国纪录。上海选手步子刚在二十四日的男子一百米蛙泳预赛中，用一分八秒六的时间首先游完全程，不仅打破了一分九秒三的去年的全国纪录，而且平了他在今年四月间创造的目前全国最高成绩。在这项预赛中，广东选手罗计崧以一分九秒的成绩，第一次打破这项全国纪录。今天是比赛的最后一天。在少年男子四百米混合式接力决赛中，由萧镜源、丁巧森、秦伟慈、张秋组成的广东队以四分三十六秒八的成绩，打破去年四分三十七秒八的少年全国纪录。
    参加这次锦标赛的有十八个单位的二百九十多名运动员。在成年组和少年组全部五十七个项目的比赛中，广东队获得三十一项冠军，上海获得十六项冠军。
