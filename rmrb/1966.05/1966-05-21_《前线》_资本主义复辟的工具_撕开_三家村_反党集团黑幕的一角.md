    《前线》——资本主义复辟的工具
    ——撕开“三家村”反党集团黑幕的一角

    The emergence of "Three-Family Village" and its long-term existence are by no means accidental or isolated phenomena. The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique has a big conspiracy to subvert the socialist system and realize capitalist restoration. The magazine *Frontline* is an important tool for them to prepare public opinion for capitalist restoration.

    From June 1961 to April 1965, I worked in the editorial department of *Frontline* for a period of time, and I had some understanding of some of Deng Tuo and others' activities and remarks. Exposing it here can help us gradually tear open the heavy black curtain of the big gang of "Three-Family Village".

    *Frontline* Magazine - *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly*, Preparing Public Opinion for Capitalist Restoration

    On March 26, 1961, Deng Tuo published an article entitled *Welcome "Varied Writings"* in the *Beijing Evening News*. In this challenge to the Party, Deng Tuo, representing the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique, shouted out the voice that had been suppressed in their hearts for a long time: "We... should express a warm welcome to such 'varied writings'," and should "recognize the importance of the so-called 'varied writings' broad knowledge for various leadership work and scientific research work!" (Emphasis added by the author, same below!) What are "varied writings"? The so-called "varied writings" are those bourgeois elements, landlord class elements, and intellectuals of these classes who have not been well reformed, a handful of people with unclear political features, and reactionary figures of the landlord and bourgeois "scholar" types. This challenge, no more than a thousand words, is also the general program for the "varied writings" of the "Three-Family Village" to transform *Frontline* magazine.

    Originally, in order to prepare public opinion for capitalist restoration, Deng Tuo and his gang also planned to run a *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly*, and carefully considered every detail. Perhaps because doing so was too blatant, the *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly* did not dare to start. However, Deng Tuo stuffed the soul of "varied writings" into *Frontline*! Listen to his confession:

    "I once had an enthusiasm: to run a magazine, to run a *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly*, published every ten days, eight pages, half a newspaper. Each article does not exceed a thousand words. The content is, talk about everything, every word is not empty. Want politics, the whole is permeated with a political perspective, but to be lively." This passage was said at the memorial meeting for the third anniversary of the founding of *Frontline* editorial department on November 25, 1961. After the meeting, people had not yet dispersed, and someone eagerly asked him about the specific plans for the *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly*. Deng Tuo spoke more bluntly: "It is not to give people some knowledge, but to widely discuss many aspects of the problem, so that people can draw some useful things from it. The things made out should be cannonballs in every word." Later, when talking about how to "improve" *Frontline* magazine according to this "varied writings" soul, Deng Tuo further elaborated that this publication should specialize in things that other publications do not publish, to "make it liked by people from all walks of life".

    The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique understood the importance of newspapers and periodicals very well. If they wanted to oppose the Party, oppose the revolution, and oppose socialism, they had to rope in a group of miscellaneous figures, seize the propaganda front, create public opinion through newspapers and periodicals, corrupt people's souls, and prepare conditions for capitalist restoration. This is an important part of their led, organized, and planned large-scale conspiracy against the Party and against socialism. The *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly* in Deng Tuo's mind was the organ of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique, and the cannonballs in every word that it was to produce were directly aimed at our Party and directly aimed at socialism.

    What if the *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly* could not be started for a while? Listen to Deng Tuo's answer:

    "I have not completely given up on running the *Varied Writings Bi-Weekly*. Now, we can take one-fifth of the space from our publication (ie, *Frontline*) and add the soul of 'varied writings' to it!... Compress other aspects!" Look! Stubborn counter-revolutionaries will see "God" with granite heads; it is impossible for them to give up their anti-Party and anti-socialist hearts. This is also a law.

    If you want to change, you have to change quickly. Look at the twenty-third and twenty-fourth issues of *Frontline* in 1961. The number of pages of "Thoughts and Musings" has increased, the "chanting of ancient texts" in "Reciting Ancient Texts" has been prominently reported (see *Strolling in Yanyuan*), Wu Han's call to "read more and study hard" has been issued, and the advertisement recommending Wu Han's *China History Small Series* has also been published... . In the twenty-fourth issue alone, there are thirteen pages of "miscellaneous" articles, almost half of the entire magazine.

    In this way, *Frontline* magazine became, to a greater extent, a propaganda tool and "organ publication" of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique.

    From one-fifth to one-half, Deng Tuo and others should be satisfied, right? No! Their ambitions are even greater, and their demands are even more.

    On June 26, 1962, Deng Tuo made another speech at the editorial department meeting of *Frontline*. He first talked about the current situation of newspaper and periodical propaganda work, saying that now "it is like a person walking to a fork in the road, and needs to stop and study it." Please note the "fork in the road"! In the eyes of the Chinese people, the socialist road leads directly to communism. Where does the "fork in the road" come from! The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique dreamed of capitalist restoration day and night, and dreamed of taking the capitalist road day and night. When our country encountered temporary difficulties, Deng Tuo gloated and became complacent, revealing the "secrets of heaven" here. Deng Tuo was excited and eloquent at the time: "Now is a good time for propaganda, not a bad time for propaganda, not a time when there is no way, we should be actively optimistic." We know that the reactionaries' assessment of the situation is always wrong. The rightists of 1957 were like this, the right-leaning opportunists of 1959 were like this, and the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique is still like this this time. Based on this "positive and optimistic" analysis of the situation, he issued a mobilization order: "We must open up our own path for the publication!" "There are very many paths in the world, we should actively think of ways to promote propaganda, and the path we find at the beginning may not be clear, but we will slowly find it."

    After this speech, *Frontline* became even more "principled," on the general program put forward in the article *Welcome "Varied Writings"*.

    Starting from the thirteenth issue in 1962, *Frontline* magazine successively added new "special columns" such as "Knowledge Snippets", "Talks on Skills", "Record of Seeking Knowledge", and "Reader Mailbox". Immediately following this "principled" meeting, Deng Tuo took the lead in demonstrating, throwing out his poisonous weed *Treating "Amnesia"* in the fourteenth issue, which viciously attacked the Party. Liao Mosha and Wu Han followed suit, throwing out *Aspiring to Greatness While Remaining Humble* and *On Morality Again* in the fifteenth and sixteenth issues... .

    From then on, a very strange phenomenon occurred: some manuscripts that promoted Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought were transferred by *Frontline* to other newspapers and periodicals for publication; while manuscripts that other newspapers and periodicals disdained to use could be published in *Frontline*. Some "sensitive" authors, especially those belonging to the "varied writings" category, visited Deng Tuo with manuscripts that other newspapers and periodicals refused to publish, and *Frontline* quickly published them. What people like, I discard; what people discard, I like. Birds of a feather flock together. True! True!

    At this point, "varied writings with broad knowledge" are even more "brilliant" in *Frontline*.

    At this point, *Frontline* can be regarded as having completely embarked on "its own path".

    How did the "brothers" of the "Three-Family Village" fire black guns and poison arrows at the Party?

    The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique has a whole set of cunning and vicious methods in carrying out led, organized, and planned subversive activities: "breaking out of the gate" to write "new historical dramas" is one type; "fraudulently" throwing out old goods *Spear Collection* is another; writing "Notes" and speaking coded language in the "Three-Family Village" black shop is an even more common one. Here, let us focus on how they use the latter method.

    This anti-Party clique that holds the "red flag" to oppose the red flag habitually uses the methods of "pointing at the mulberry tree to scold the locust tree" and "attacking sideways" to forge poison arrows. In order to "summarize and attribute the spearhead of the attack to the political situation," their articles must "originate from the insignificance of flies and bedbugs"; in order to achieve their anti-Party "political goals" without revealing their true colors, their coded language must be "ambiguous". Deng Tuo has already revealed this point in articles such as *The Death of Lin Baishui* and *Caring About Everything*. Now, let's take a look at the coded language he spoke internally.

    On July 8, 1963, in a speech to all cadres of the *Frontline* editorial department, Deng Tuo emphasized "daring to express opinions," and then specifically talked about the issue of how to use historical stories to write articles. He said:

     "There are many problems now. Our publication should adopt an active spirit and express its opinions on everything, no matter what happens. As a publication, we must dare to express our opinions on all work and various issues." How to express opinions? "It is not to be a mentor and wield the baton indiscriminately, but to talk about some principles." Regarding the specific method of speaking, he made three points, one of which was particularly detailed, "Some historical stories from the past can still be told. You can put several examples of the same nature together, process them, and combine them together. To make people see that it is aimed at the present, rather than telling stories for the sake of telling stories. Otherwise, the practical significance is not great. If a certain aspect of the story is missing to explain the problem, you have to find it yourself... If you really can't find it, write a paragraph yourself."

    This is really a self-confession, really a wonderful confession! This confession has given us a key to open the secret room of the "Three-Family Village", a key to open all the anti-Party and anti-socialist coded language of the "Three-Family Village". Why does Deng Tuo, who prides himself on his knowledge of history, arbitrarily fabricate historical facts in his articles? Why does Deng Tuo, who has always advocated respecting science and seeking truth, wantonly lie and spread rumors in his articles? Understood! Understood! It turns out that "if a certain aspect of the ready-made story is missing to explain the problem" and cannot be found, it is possible to "write a paragraph yourself". No wonder! No wonder! Because the owners of the "Three-Family Village" are not "telling stories for the sake of telling stories". Their coded language, written for people to see, "is aimed at the present" and has "practical significance". Comrade Qi Yi, a reader, once pointed out that Deng Tuo's *Treating "Amnesia"* was not about medicine but about politics. The *Frontline* editorial department, according to Deng Tuo's instructions, said in its reply to Comrade Qi Yi that *Treating "Amnesia"* "is discussing the matter on its own merits, introducing some relevant situations and knowledge." Now, Deng Tuo has exposed his lies with his own truth. This further exposes the ugly face of Deng Tuo, an anti-Party and anti-socialist element, as being guilty of wrongdoing and trying to cover it up.

    What if readers cannot see through it if they do so? Isn't it a waste of effort to fabricate the story? It doesn't matter, there is still a great trick! This is the "straightforwardness" that Deng Tuo has repeatedly emphasized: to scold straightforwardly, to attack straightforwardly! In the "sideways" themes, extract a "straightforward" central idea and stab it "straight to the point" at the Party, "every word is a cannonball." Listen to Deng Tuo's confession:

    "Essays need to find feelings... Because there are feelings in objective things, there are groans... The key is to think carefully about the theme, and to think carefully about the key sentence. The key is to think carefully about what judgment or proposition to put forward. This sentence must be thought through. If this is thought through, it must be fresh, and people must be willing to read it, and there must be something to write. Poems and articles are all like this. If there is no center or epigram in them, it is impossible to write well. To come up with a judgment, to extract a central idea, everything else is easy to handle. Add some techniques, and it will not fail. Including *Three-Family Village Notes*." He also said: "We can cultivate some people to write boldly, write some articles that hit the nail on the head... Cleanly and neatly cut it down with one knife, saying it very cleanly, leaving no trace. Speak the essentials, and put forward some substantial conclusions." Is this talking about essay writing? No! "Knife", "blood", "essentials", a murderous atmosphere! A fierce anti-Party and anti-socialist face! An anti-Party and anti-socialist cruel heart! This is the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique's attack technique against the Party and against socialism. However, "leaving no trace" is impossible. Their anti-Party and anti-socialist traces are left behind and exposed in broad daylight.

    How did Deng Tuo and his gang make long-term plans to defend their position?

    After Deng Tuo threw out his *Thirty-Six Stratagems* on September 2, 1962, he put away the *Yanshan Evening Talks* signboard. Did Deng Tuo really "wash his hands" from then on? No! *Zheng Banqiao and "Banqiao Style"*, published in the *Guangming Daily* on November 21, 1963, was a big poisonous arrow he launched against the Party. However, after the *Yanshan Evening Talks* closed, Deng Tuo indeed launched fewer poisonous arrows against the Party and socialism in other newspapers and periodicals than before, except for continuing to sell black goods in the "Three-Family Village" black shop. Deng Tuo said that he "turned the attention of his amateur activities to other aspects."

    Where did it turn to? Go underground, make long-term plans, protect the "Three-Family Village" lair, and defend the anti-Party and anti-socialist position *Frontline*.

    Deng Tuo's withdrawal from the *Yanshan Evening Talks* position and defense of the "Three-Family Village" lair were conducted in a led, organized, and planned manner.

    On November 25, 1962, taking advantage of the fourth anniversary of the founding of *Frontline*, Deng Tuo made a low-key, ambiguous speech at the *Frontline* editorial department. Deng Tuo said:

    "Today is about our own affairs. We have been working for four years, which is a very short time. But this is a very important beginning. The road ahead is still very long. Who knows what problems we will encounter? It is difficult to predict."

    This listless opening remarks revealed the common mood of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique. At that time, the situation in our country was getting better day by day, and the situation of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique was getting worse day by day.

    After some emotion, Deng Tuo put forward new requirements and deployments to everyone. The general spirit is: to "sum up experience", maintain the "team", and persist in the "position". Deng Tuo said: "There is some experience in the past few years, and it should be well summarized... We have the responsibility to summarize the experience of running a 'Party journal'. Summarizing experience is to run it well. Whether or not to have a Party journal is determined by the 'Party'."

    Here, whose "Party" is the "Party" in Deng Tuo's mouth? Why did he emphasize "summing up experience" at this time? Why didn't he "sum up experience" half a year ago when "walking to a fork in the road" and "needing to stop"? Because Deng Tuo's anti-Party activities were in a feverish stage half a year ago, and now it is really time to "stop" and change tactics.

    Deng Tuo said that we "already have a team, although it is a very small team, it is very important... Having a team and a position is a beginning, which is an important point that cannot be underestimated." Since there is a position, how should we seize this position as their anti-Party tool, and how to make this team "loyal" to them to defend their position? Deng Tuo asked everyone to "have ambition", so that the "soul has something to rely on", and engage in some "permanent topics", "which can be fired without fail in the future." "If it is done well, a group of Party theory fighters will naturally be cultivated, who can fight and stand alone in the future. Everyone must be prepared to meet new tasks." Look, how great Deng Tuo's ambitions are! He attacked the Party and attacked socialism, to achieve "fire without fail"; he wanted to cultivate a group of "fighters" who could "fight and stand alone" in the anti-Party criminal activities. In this way, once capitalist restoration is realized, his "soul" will have "something to rely on". However, his "ambition" will never be realized!

    What new tasks should we meet? Deng Tuo talked about the struggle against revisionism at the time. But Deng Tuo himself is a revisionist and a traitor to the Communist Party. He echoed the Khrushchev modern revisionist clique everywhere, and even advocated learning from revisionism in the article *The Way to Make Friends and Treat Guests*. When making a political report in August 1963, he described Khrushchev, the greatest contemporary revisionist, as a fighter who had made mistakes and could turn back and was "infinitely loyal to the revolution and socialism." Would such a person oppose revisionism? No, absolutely not. At this meeting, Deng Tuo cleverly recommended to everyone: "Djilas of Yugoslavia wrote a book *The New Class*. This person still has something. We should find his book to read." Then, he also promoted, "Revisionism will come out in every period of transition, in every period of new and old alternation. Every time a Marxist dies, his closest person—friend, old acquaintance—comes out to revise it. According to this statement, will there be more and more revisionism in the future? There will definitely be more and more!" Look, is this encouraging everyone to oppose revisionism? Khrushchev would secretly laugh when he heard Deng Tuo and his ilk talk about anti-revisionism. It is very obvious that the revisionist Deng Tuo is expressing his inner fervent hopes here, instilling revisionist ideas into his audience, and transforming his team into a tool against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought.

    Is the small team of the *Frontline* editorial department enough? Of course not! On June 25, 1963, Deng Tuo asked everyone to "have extensive contacts with the outside world", to make friends with some "cadres of grassroots units", "authors", and various miscellaneous "friends", "to be like a snowball, the more we meet, the wider we roll, and constantly discover talents in various units... This is a big problem."

    In fact, Deng Tuo has already won over some close friends for their anti-Party clique, including some "authorities", "masters", "famous people", and even traitors and rightists, everything. These miscellaneous people regarded Deng Tuo as their "prophet", advisor, or mentor. Deng Tuo then used the leadership position he had stolen to wield the baton indiscriminately, pull people into the water, and help him spread poison.

    In order to firmly grasp the team, Deng Tuo also stepped up "ideological work", enlightened everyone not to be afraid of "bumping their heads and bleeding", to "touch the truth", "Hear the Dao in the morning, die in the evening!" On June 25, 1963, Deng Tuo expressed a lot of emotion in his speech, borrowing a trivial matter of finding cover photos, saying, "It is also good for people to be embarrassed. Bump around everywhere, bump their heads and bleed, their scalps will become harder, they will have more experience, and then it will be easy to handle." And the problem he focused on was to "touch the truth." He said, "To 'touch the truth'," "really wholeheartedly delve into it, for the sake of truth, for the sake of career," "Now we are constantly recognizing the truth," "People in the past thought, 'Hear the Dao in the morning, die in the evening!' Then why can't we devote ourselves to pursuing this 'Dao'—truth, objective laws!?" So, he brought up "ambition" and "aspiration" again, "We must have ambition... Why can't unlimited and accomplished people come from the people around us we are familiar with?"

    Deng Tuo has said a lot of coded language here, which must be exposed. "Touching the truth" is to find anti-Party methods. "For the sake of career" is for the sake of the counter-revolutionary career. "Hear the Dao in the morning, die in the evening!" means that once capitalist restoration is realized, even if they break their heads and bleed, they will not hesitate to be smashed to pieces. "Have ambition" means to have the ambition to oppose the Party. "Why can't unlimited and accomplished people come from the people around us we are familiar with?" means that among the people you are familiar with, our "Three-Family Village" generals will one day come to power and usurp power. Do it, guys! A great deal will be recorded on your anti-revolutionary merits!

    The Joint Offensive of the "Three-Family Village" Anti-Party Clique

    In January 1961, after Wu Han published *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, Liao Mosha and Wu Han exchanged two public letters on the *Beijing Evening News*, calling each other "brother". People who do not know the inside story may think that these two "brothers" do not have many opportunities to meet. In fact, this is not the case. These two brothers and their village chief Deng Tuo often "three heads face the case." They did this in order to create a turbulent momentum and put on a posture of fighting hard.

    In the few years when the "Three-Family Village" gang launched a rampant attack on the Party, in addition to publishing *Three-Family Village Notes* in each issue of *Frontline* magazine, the places where Deng Tuo often released poisonous weeds were *Beijing Evening News*; Wu Han focused on writing articles and publishing scripts in *Beijing Daily* and *Beijing Literature*, editing *China History Small Series*, and lobbying and lecturing everywhere; Liao Mosha firmly grasped *Frontline* and released poisonous weeds on it.

    Is this kind of division of labor independent or does it work alone? No! They are closely coordinated joint offenses.

    The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique held the anti-Party position of *Frontline*, and at the same time used *Beijing Daily* and *Beijing Evening News* to madly engage in the criminal activities of anti-Party and anti-socialism. The three bosses, who were like-minded and handy, not only cooperated with each other but also praised each other.

    In November 1961, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of *Frontline*, Liao Mosha used the essay *Where is "Kong Zhizhuo"* in the twenty-second issue of *Frontline* to publish a large advertisement for Deng Tuo's *Yanshan Evening Talks*; Deng Tuo instructed *Frontline* magazine, which he edited, to promote Wu Han's *China History Small Series*, which was full of poisonous weeds and toxins, saying that "this is a very meaningful thing" and "a good way to popularize historical knowledge", saying that it "pays attention to the significance and role of historical events and historical figures for the people under today's social conditions, so that readers can obtain beneficial nourishment from the actual study of history, learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, review the old and know the new, and achieve the purpose of using the past for the present."

    The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique was extremely fierce in exercising bourgeois dictatorship over the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and "shooting down" the opinions of the revolutionary masses.

    In May 1962, after Wu Han's *On Morality* was published in *Frontline*, the editorial department received many letters and manuscripts criticizing this poisonous weed. After Deng Tuo read this large pile of letters and manuscripts from the masses, he decisively instructed the editorial department to transfer them all to Wu Han for "handling". Wu Han's handling method was to come up with another *On Morality* and continue to release poison!

    In order to make the staff of the editorial department obediently admit the brilliance of this "handling" method, Deng Tuo explicitly instructed in his speech to all members of the editorial department on June 26: "If the road is narrow, it is people who have walked it out; originally it was wide. Controversial articles can be published," but "it is not necessary to publish both the article and the rebuttal, you can only publish one side." According to this "can" approach, only Wu Han is allowed to release poison arrows again and again, and no one else is allowed to say a word; only Deng Tuo is allowed to pour "dog blood" on our "heads" and use Western clubs to beat us into "shock", and no one is allowed to say "no."

    In early 1962, Liao Mosha's "Opinions" on current newspaper and periodical work were published in *News Business*; in early 1963, Wu Han's *Learning Collection* was compiled and published. Judging from the tone of Deng Tuo's occasional remarks about these two events afterward, Liao and Wu had consulted Deng Tuo beforehand. At the beginning of his speech to the cadres of the *Frontline* editorial department on June 26, 1962, Deng Tuo mentioned: " *News Business* published Mosha's opinions on newspaper work. I had already told Mosha that some opinions can only be discussed internally. Why write them out!" After Wu Han's *Learning Collection* was published, Deng Tuo mentioned in a speech: "I once advised Wu Han not to include the article *On Morality* in the collection. But he didn't listen! This matter will cause trouble!" After all, Deng Tuo, a veteran of running newspapers and periodicals for a long time, is cunning and sophisticated, and more vigilant than his "brothers"! But since you have done so many bad things, how can you escape "trouble"!

    In the second half of 1964, Wu Han's two *On Morality* and *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* were already infamous, and the situation seemed very urgent. It was no longer possible to protect all the vehicles, horses, and generals of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique. At this time, under the direct instructions of the director, Deng Tuo first wrote an article criticizing Wu Han's moral inheritance theory under the pseudonym "Jin Shiwei", and later, on the basis of this article, he changed his appearance and published that infamous fake criticism article under the pseudonym "Xiang Yangsheng", staging the ugly drama of "Zhou Yu beating Huang Gai". The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique retreated while fighting in a led, planned, and organized manner.

    Who issued the business license to the "Three-Family Village" black shop?

    The anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of Deng Tuo and his gang were not carried out secretly. They were not opening underground factories. Obviously, their activities must have been instigated, supported, and sheltered by someone.

    *Frontline* magazine is a theoretical publication sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. What is puzzling is that when class enemies at home and abroad were stirring up a black wind, why were Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han able to shoot one poison arrow after another, issue after issue, in *Frontline*? If no one was actively supporting them, could they have done this?

    We want to ask: What kind of person, for what purpose, and with what ambition, issued the business license to the "Three-Family Village" black shop?

    These serious questions must be answered!

    I am a person who has worked in the editorial department of *Frontline*. I feel that it is my responsibility to expose some of the inside stories of the "Three-Family Village" that I know. I also hope that all comrades in the editorial department of *Frontline* who are willing to make revolution will resolutely stand up, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, completely break with the bourgeois representatives in front and behind the scenes of the "Three-Family Village", and boldly expose their criminal activities and conspiracies against the Party and against socialism.

    We must defeat the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique, we must eradicate the black line against the Party and against socialism, and we must completely eradicate the poisonous roots of the "Three-Family Village".

    (Author's note: The remarks of Deng Tuo quoted in the article, all the materials that have not been published, are extracted word by word from the detailed records made at that time. After the full text was written, it was given to two comrades who worked together before - Sun Dianyi and Yang Hongyun, to help them check and confirm some of the facts mentioned in the article, and they received their active support and help.)

    “三家村”的出现，“三家村”的长期存在，绝不是偶然的孤立的现象。“三家村”反党集团，有一个妄想颠覆社会主义制度、实现资本主义复辟的大阴谋。《前线》杂志就是他们为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的一个重要工具。
    一九六一年六月至一九六五年四月，我曾在《前线》编辑部工作过一个时期，对于邓拓等人的一部分活动和言论，有些了解。这里把它揭露出来，可以帮助我们逐渐把“三家村”这个大黑帮的重重黑幕扯开。
    《前线》杂志——为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的《杂家旬刊》
    一九六一年三月二十六日，邓拓在《北京晚报》上发表了《欢迎“杂家”》一文。在这篇向党发出的挑战书中，邓拓代表着“三家村”反党集团，声嘶力竭地喊出了在他们心中憋闷了很久的声音：“我们……应该对这样的‘杂家’表示热烈的欢迎”，应该“承认所谓‘杂家’的广博知识对于各种领导工作和科学研究工作的重要意义”！（着重点是作者加的，下同）什么是“杂家”？所谓“杂家”，就是那些没有改造好的资产阶级分子、地主阶级分子及这些阶级的知识分子，就是一撮政治面目不清的人物，就是地主资产阶级“学者”之流的反动人物。这篇不超过千字的挑战书，也就是“三家村”的“杂家”们改造《前线》杂志的总纲领。
    原来，为了给资本主义复辟作好舆论准备，邓拓一伙还准备办一个《杂家旬刊》，并且细致地考虑过每个细节。也许因为这样做起来太露骨了吧，《杂家旬刊》没敢办起来。可是，邓拓把“杂家”的灵魂塞进了《前线》！请听一听他的自供：
    “我曾经有一个兴头：办一个杂志，办个《杂家旬刊》，十天出一期，八个页面，半张报纸。每篇文章不超过千字。内容是，什么都讲，一字不空。要政治，整个的都是政治眼光贯串着，但是要生动。”这番话，是一九六一年十一月二十五日在《前线》编辑部纪念创刊三周年的会上讲的。会后，人们还没有走散，有人急切地向他询问《杂家旬刊》的具体打算。邓拓谈得更露骨了：“不是为了光给人一些知识，而是广泛谈论许多方面的问题，使人从中汲取些有用的东西。搞出来的东西，要字字是炮弹。”后来，在谈到如何按照这种“杂家”的灵魂“改进”《前线》杂志的时候，邓拓曾经进一步发挥说，在这个刊物上，要专登其它刊物所不登、所没有的东西，要“使各方面的人都喜欢它”。
    “三家村”反党集团很懂得报刊的重要性。既要反党、反革命、反社会主义，就要网罗一批杂七杂八的人物，夺取宣传阵地，通过报刊制造舆论，腐蚀人的灵魂，为资本主义复辟准备条件。这是他们有领导、有组织、有计划地反党反社会主义大阴谋中的一个重要组成部分。邓拓心目中的《杂家旬刊》，就是“三家村”反党集团的机关报，它要搞出来的字字炮弹，都是直接射向我们党、直接射向社会主义的。
    《杂家旬刊》一时办不起来，怎么办？请听邓拓的回答：
    “对于办《杂家旬刊》，我还没有完全死心。现在，可以从我们的刊物（即《前线》），拿出五分之一的篇幅，把‘杂家’的灵魂加进去！……别的方面的东西，压缩一下！”看吧！顽固的反革命，是要带着花冈岩的脑袋见“上帝”的，要他们死掉反党反社会主义的心是不可能的。这也是一条规律。
    要变，就得快变。请看一九六一年《前线》第二十三期和第二十四期。“思想杂谈”的页数增多了，“背诵古文”的“琅琅书声”被突出地报道出来了（见《燕园漫步》），吴晗的
  “要多读书，用功读书”的号召发出了，推荐吴晗主编的《中国历史小丛书》的广告也登出来了……。仅第二十四期上，“杂七杂八”的文章就有十三页，差不多占了整个杂志的一半篇幅。
    这样，《前线》杂志就在一个更大的程度上变成了“三家村”反党集团的宣传工具和“机关刊物”。
    由五分之一到二分之一，邓拓等人总该满意了吧？不！他们的野心还要大，他们的要求还要多。
    一九六二年六月二十六日，邓拓在《前线》编辑部会议上又作了一次讲话。他先谈到当前报刊宣传工作的形势，说现在
  “象人走路到了分岔路口一样，需要停一停，研究一下”。请注意“分岔路口”！在中国人民的眼里，社会主义大道直通共产主义，哪来的什么“分岔路口”！“三家村”反党集团日夜梦想资本主义复辟，日夜梦想走资本主义道路，当我国遇到暂时困难的时候，邓拓幸灾乐祸，得意忘形，在这里泄露了“天机”。邓拓当时兴高采烈，慷慨陈词：“现在是个好宣传的时候，不是个不好宣传的时候，不是没办法的时候，应该积极乐观。”我们知道，反动派对形势的估计总是错误的。一九五七年的右派分子如此，一九五九年的右倾机会主义分子如此，“三家村”反党集团这次仍然是如此。基于对形势的这种“积极、乐观”的分析，他下了动员令：“要开辟刊物自己的路子！”“天下路子非常多，应该积极想办法去宣传，开始找的路子可能不明确，慢慢就找出来了。” 
    这次讲话之后，《前线》更加上“纲”了，上了《欢迎“杂家”》一文中提出的总纲领。
    从一九六二年第十三期开始，《前线》杂志上陆续地增加了“知识小品”、“技艺话丛”、“求知录”、“读者信箱”等新的“特栏”。紧接着这次上“纲”会议，邓拓率先示范，在十四期上抛出了他恶毒攻击党的大毒草《专治“健忘症”》。廖沫沙、吴晗跟踵而上，在十五期和十六期接连抛出了《志欲大而心欲小》和《再说道德》……。
    从此，一个很奇怪的现象发生了：有些宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的稿件，《前线》转给别的报刊发表了；而其它报刊所不屑用的稿子，却可以登上《前线》。有些“锐敏”的作者，特别是属于“杂家”一类的人物，带着其它报刊不予发表的稿件登门拜访邓拓，而《前线》就很快刊用了。人好之，我弃之；人弃之，我好之。物以类聚，人以群分，信然！信然！
    至此，“具有广博知识的杂家”们在《前线》上更加“大放异彩”了。
    至此，《前线》算是完全闯出了“自己的路子”。
    “三家村”的“兄弟”是怎样向党发射黑枪毒箭的？
    “三家村”反党集团在进行有领导、有组织、有计划的颠覆活动中，有一整套狡猾毒辣的手法：“破门而出”写“新编历史剧”，是一种；“作伪舞弊”地抛射旧货《投枪集》，又是一种；在“三家村”黑店里写“札记”、讲黑话，更是常用的一种。这里，我们就来着重看看他们是怎样运用后一种方式的。
    这个打着“红旗”反红旗的反党集团，他们惯用“指桑骂槐”、“旁敲侧击”的手法来铸造毒箭。为了把进攻的矛头“归结及于政局”，他们的文章要“发端于苍蝇、臭虫之微”；为了达到其反党的“政治目的”而又不露马脚，他们的黑话要“语带双关”。这一点，邓拓在《林白水之死》、《事事关心》等文中，已经透露出来。现在再看看他在内部讲过的黑话。
    一九六三年七月八日，邓拓在对《前线》编辑部全体干部的一次讲话中，强调“要敢于发表意见”之后，很具体地讲到如何利用历史故事写文章的问题。他说：
      “现在问题很多。我们的刊物应当采取积极的精神，不管什么事情都要发表意见。一切工作，各种问题，作为一个刊物，都要敢于发表意见。”怎么样去发表意见呢？“不是好为人师，乱舞指挥棒，而是讲一些原则问题”。关于具体的讲法，他提了三点，其中特别讲得详细的一点是，“过去一些历史上的故事，现在还可以讲。可以把几个例子，同类性质的，放在一起，进行加工，综合在一起。使人看了是针对当前的，而不是为了讲故事而讲故事。否则，现实意义不大。假如现成的故事中缺少说明问题的某一方面，要自己去找，……实在找不到，自己写上一段话。”
    这真是不打自招，真是绝妙的一段供词！这段供词使我们得到了一把打开“三家村”密室的钥匙，打开“三家村”所有反党反社会主义黑话的钥匙。为什么以通晓历史知识自诩的邓拓，竟会在他的文章里任意捏造历史事实呢？为什么一向宣扬要尊重科学、讲求真理的邓拓，竟会在他的文章里肆意扯谎造谣呢？明白了！明白了！原来“假如现成的故事中缺少说明问题的某一方面”，又找不到时，是可以“自己写上一段话”的。不奇怪！不奇怪！因为“三家村”的主人并“不是为了讲故事而讲故事”，他们的黑话，写出去让人看，“是针对当前的”，是有“现实意义”的。读者戚益同志曾指出邓拓的《专治“健忘症”》不是谈医道，而是谈政治，《前线》编辑部按照邓拓的授意，在给戚益同志的复信中说，《专治“健忘症”》“是就事论事，介绍一些有关的情况和知识。”现在好了，邓拓用自己的真话把他的假话揭穿了。这就进一步暴露了邓拓这个反党反社会主义分子的作贼心虚，欲盖弥彰的丑态。
    这样做，读者如果看不透怎么办呢？那不是白白编造了故事吗？不要紧，还有绝招！这就是邓拓所一再强调的“开门见山”：要开门见山地骂，开门见山地攻！要在“旁敲侧击”的题材中，提炼出一个“开门见山”的中心思想来，把它“一针见血”地刺向党，“字字是炮弹”。请听邓拓的自供：
    “杂谈是要去找感想。……因为客观事物中是有感想在那里的，是有呻吟的。……关键是主题要好好想，其中关键的一句话要好好想。关键是要好好想想，究竟提出个什么判断、命题。这一句话要想透。这个想好了，必然新鲜，必然有人愿意看，写起来也一定有东西。诗、文章都是这样，如果其中没有个中心、警句，那没个写好。要搞出一个判断，提炼出一个中心思想来，其它的都好办。再加上些手法，就不会失败。包括《三家村札记》在内。”又说：“我们可以培养一些人大胆写，写一些一针见血的文章。……干净利落地一刀下去，讲的很干净，不留痕迹。讲要害，提出些有分量的结论。”这是谈杂文写法吗？不！“刀”、“血”、“要害”，一片杀气腾腾！一张反党反社会主义的凶恶面孔！一副反党反社会主义的狠毒心肠！这是“三家村”反党集团向党、向社会主义的进攻术。然而，“不留痕迹”是办不到的。他们的反党反社会主义的痕迹留下来了，并且暴露在光天化日之下。
    邓拓一伙是怎样从长计议坚守阵地的？
    一九六二年九月二日，邓拓抛出了他的《三十六计》之后，收起了《燕山夜话》的招牌。难道邓拓真的从此“洗手不干”了吗？没有！一九六三年十一月二十一日发表在《光明日报》上的《郑板桥和“板桥体”》，就是他向党进攻的一支大毒箭。不过，从《燕山夜话》收摊以后，除了在“三家村”黑店里继续出售黑货之外，邓拓在其他报刊上向党向社会主义发射的毒箭的确不象以前那么多了。邓拓说他“把业余活动的注意力转到其它方面”去了。
    转到哪里去了？转入地下，从长计议，保护“三家村”老窝，坚守反党反社会主义的阵地《前线》。
    邓拓退出《燕山夜话》这块阵地，坚守“三家村”老窝，是有领导、有组织、有计划地进行的。
    一九六二年十一月二十五日，乘着《前线》创刊四周年的机会，邓拓在《前线》编辑部作了一次调子低沉、语意双关的讲话。邓拓说：
    “今天是讲我们本身的事。我们工作四年了，这算来是个很短的时间。但这是个很重要的开端。今后的路子还很长，谁知道还会遇到什么问题呢？很难预料。”
    这段无精打采的开场白，流露了“三家村”反党集团的共同心情。在那时，我们国家的形势一天天好转了，“三家村”反党集团的处境一天天不妙了。
    感慨一番之后，邓拓对大家提出了新的要求和部署。总的精神是：要“总结经验”，保持“队伍”，坚持“阵地”。邓拓说：“这几年有些经验，要好好总结。……我们有责任把办‘党刊’的经验好好总结起来。总结经验，就是要把它很好地办下去。要不要党刊是由‘党’决定的。”
    在这里，邓拓嘴里的“党”，是什么人的“党”呢？为什么偏偏在这个时候又要强调“总结经验”呢？怎么不在半年前
  “走路到了分岔路口上”“需要停一停”的时候“总结经验”呢？因为邓拓的反党活动在半年前正处于狂热的阶段，而现在，则真正是到了“需要停一停”改变战术的时候了。
    邓拓说，我们“已经有了个队伍，虽然是个很小的队伍，但很重要。……有了个队伍和阵地，开了端，这是不可轻视的、重要的一点。”阵地有了，那么又该怎样抓住这个阵地作为他们的反党工具，怎样使这个队伍“忠诚”地为他们坚守阵地呢？邓拓要求大家“要有雄心”，使“灵魂有所寄托”，搞一些“永久性题目”，“将来可以弹不虚发”。“搞好了，自然会培养出一批党的理论战士，将来能打仗，能独挡一面。大家都要作好准备。迎接新的任务”。看吧，邓拓的抱负多么大！他攻击党攻击社会主义，要做到“弹不虚发”；他要培养一批“战士”，在反党的罪恶活动中“能打仗，能独挡一面”。这样一来，实现了资本主义复辟，他的“灵魂”就“有所寄托”了。然而他这样的“雄心”，是永远不会实现的！
    迎接什么新的任务呢？邓拓当时谈到反对修正主义的斗争。而邓拓自己就是个修正主义分子，共产党的叛徒。他处处和赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团唱一个调子，甚至在《交友待客之道》一文中，鼓吹要向修正主义“学习”，在一九六三年八月作政治报告的时候，曾把当代最大的修正主义者赫鲁晓夫，说成是犯了错误可以回头的“对革命和社会主义无限忠诚”的战士，这样的人，他会反对修正主义吗？不会，绝对不会。就在这次会上，邓拓曾以狡猾的手法向大家推荐说：“南斯拉夫的德热拉斯，写了一本《论新阶级》，这个人还是有点东西的。要把他的书找来看看。”接着，他还宣扬说：“每个转折时期、新旧交替的时期，修正主义就会出来。每个马克思主义者死了，都有他最亲近的人——朋友，老交情，出来修正它。按照这种说法，将来的修正主义不是会越来越多吗？一定会越来越多！”请看，这是鼓励大家反对修正主义吗？邓拓之流谈反修，赫鲁晓夫听了也会暗中发笑。非常明显，修正主义者邓拓是在这里表白他内心的热烈希望，是在向他的听众灌输修正主义思想，是要把他的队伍改造成为反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的工具。
    只是《前线》编辑部这个小队伍够用吗？当然不够！在一九六三年六月二十五日，邓拓又要大家“和外边交往要广泛”，要结交一些“基层单位的干部”，“作者”，以及各种杂七杂八的“朋友”，“要如滚雪球一样，越交越广，越滚越大，在各单位不断地发现人材。……这是个大问题。”
    事实上，邓拓已经为他们的反党集团笼络了一些至亲好友，包括某些“权威”、“大师”、“著名人士”，甚至汉奸、右派，应有尽有。这些杂七杂八的人，把邓拓当作他们的“先知”、谋士或导师。邓拓则利用了他所窃据的领导岗位，乱舞指挥棒，拉人下水，帮他放毒。
    为了把队伍死死抓住，邓拓还加紧“思想工作”，开导大家不要怕“碰个头破血流”，要“摸真理”，“朝闻道，夕死可也！”一九六三年六月二十五日，邓拓在讲话当中，曾借着找封面照片的小事发了一通感慨，说：“人狼狈一下也有好处。到处碰，碰个头破血流，头皮也硬了，经验也多了，那时就好办了。”而他着重讲的问题是要“摸真理”，他说，“要为了‘摸真理’”，“真正死心塌地地钻进去，为了真理，为了事业”，“现在我们就是在不断地认识真理之中”，“过去的人，认为‘朝闻道，夕死可也！’那么我们为何不能为追求这个‘道’——真理、客观规律而献身努力呢！？”于是，他又提起“雄心”“抱负”来，“我们要有雄心。……为什么前途不可限量的、有成就的人，不会从我们熟悉的周围的人当中产生呢？”
    邓拓在这里讲了一大堆黑话，必须给他拆穿。“摸真理”就是寻找反党方法。“为了事业”就是为了反革命事业。“朝闻道，夕死可也”就是一旦资本主义复辟实现，虽头破血流、粉身碎骨也在所不惜。“要有雄心”就是要有反党的野心。“为什么前途不可限量的、有成就的人，不会从我们熟悉的周围的人当中产生呢”，就是在你们所熟悉的人中，我们“三家村”的将帅有朝一日要登台篡位的，伙计们，干吧！反革命的功劳簿上将来会给你记一大笔！
    “三家村”反党集团的联合进攻
    一九六一年一月，在吴晗发表了《海瑞罢官》之后，廖沫沙同吴晗之间曾在《北京晚报》上称“兄”道“弟”地发表了一来一往的两封公开信。不明内情的人，可能以为这“兄弟”二人见面机会不多。其实不然。这两位兄弟以及他们的村长邓拓，是经常“三头对案”的。他们这样作，是为了造成一派汹汹的气势，摆一副拼一拼的进攻姿态。
    在“三家村”黑帮向党发动猖狂进攻的几年内，除了在《前线》杂志上每期都登载《三家村札记》外，邓拓经常放毒草的地方是《北京晚报》；吴晗则着力于在《北京日报》和《北京文艺》上写文章、登剧本，主编《中国历史小丛书》，并到处游说讲演；廖沫沙紧紧抓住《前线》不放，在上面大放毒草。
    这种各有分工的作法，是互不联系地单干吗？不！他们是密切配合的联合进攻。
    “三家村”反党集团，把持着反党阵地的《前线》，同时使用《北京日报》，使用《北京晚报》，疯狂地干着反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。三位老板，情投意合，得心应手，既互相配合，又互相吹捧。
    一九六一年十一月，《前线》创刊三周年的时候，廖沫沙在第二十二期《前线》上借《“孔之卓”在哪里？》的杂文，给邓拓的《燕山夜话》大出广告；邓拓则授意他所主编的《前线》杂志，吹捧吴晗主编的塞满毒草浸透毒素的《中国历史小丛书》，说“这是一件很有意义的事情”，是“普及历史知识的良好途径”，说它“注意到了历史事件、历史人物在今天社会条件下对人民的意义和作用，使读者从历史实际的学习中，取得有益的营养，惩前毖后，温故知新，达到古为今用的目的”。
    在对广大工农兵群众实行资产阶级专政，“枪毙”革命群众的意见方面，“三家村”反党集团表现得极为凶狠。
    一九六二年五月，吴晗写的《说道德》在《前线》上发表后，编辑部收到了许多批判这株毒草的来信来稿。邓拓看过这一大叠群众来信来稿之后，大笔一挥，指令编辑部把它全部转给吴晗去“处理”。吴晗的处理办法，是来了一个《再说道德》，继续放毒！
    为了让编辑部的工作人员驯服地承认这种“处理”方法的高明，邓拓在六月二十六日对编辑部全体成员的讲话中明确地指示说：“路子窄，那是人走出来的；本来它是宽的。争论性的文章可以登”，但是“不一定文章和反驳的意见都登，可以只登一面。”按照这种“可以”的作法来看，只许吴晗一而再地放毒箭，而不许别人吭一声；只许邓拓用“狗血”淋我们的“头”，用西洋棍棒把我们打“休克”，而不允许别人说一个“不”字。
    一九六二年初，廖沫沙对当前报刊工作的“意见”，在《新闻业务》上登出来了；一九六三年初，吴晗的《学习集》编印出版了。从邓拓事后谈话中片言只语地说起这两件事的口气看，廖、吴在事前都是曾向邓拓请示过的。邓拓在一九六二年六月二十六日对《前线》编辑部干部讲话的一开头，就提到：“《新闻业务》上登了沫沙对报纸工作的意见，我早就告诉过沫沙，有些意见只可以内部谈谈，何必把它写出去！”在吴晗的《学习集》出版后，邓拓在一次讲话中提到：“我曾经劝告过吴晗，叫他不要把《说道德》的文章收进集子里去。可是他不听！这事还得惹麻烦！”毕竟是长期办报刊的老手邓拓诡计多端，油滑老练，比他的“兄弟”们警惕性高！可是，你们既然干了那么多坏事，岂能逃脱了“麻烦”！
    一九六四年下半年，吴晗的两次《说道德》和《海瑞罢官》已经臭名昭著，形势显得很紧迫。要保护住“三家村”反党集团的全部车马将帅已经不成，这时，在导演者的直接指使之下，邓拓先以“金世伟”的化名写了批判吴晗道德继承论的文章，后来又在这篇文章的基础上，改头换面，以“向阳生”的化名发表了那篇臭名远扬的假批判文章，演出了“周瑜打黄盖”的丑戏。“三家村”反党集团有领导、有计划、有组织地且战且退了。
    是谁给“三家村”黑店发了营业执照？
    邓拓一伙的反党反社会主义活动，并不是偷偷摸摸地干的，他们并不是开地下工厂。很明显，他们的活动，肯定是有人指使，有人支持，有人庇护的。
    《前线》杂志是中共北京市委主办的理论刊物。令人不解的是，在国内外阶级敌人大刮黑风的时候，邓拓、廖沫沙和吴晗为什么能够在《前线》上连篇累牍、一期不漏地射出一支又一支毒箭，如果不是有谁在积极支持他们，他们能够这样做吗？
    我们要问：是什么人，为着什么目的，存着什么野心，给“三家村”黑店发了营业执照？
    对这些严肃的问题，必须做出回答！
    我是一个曾经在《前线》编辑部工作过的人员，我感到有责任把我知道的“三家村”的一些内幕揭发出来，我也希望《前线》编辑部的其他工作人员中一切愿意革命的同志，都坚决地站出来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同“三家村”的前台、后台的资产阶级代表人物彻底决裂，大胆揭露他们反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当和阴谋活动。
    我们一定要打垮“三家村”反党集团，一定要铲除反党反社会主义的黑线，一定要彻底挖掉“三家村”的毒根。
