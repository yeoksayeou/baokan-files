    Socialism is Infinitely Good
    Hubei Xishui Iron and Steel Brigade, Qu Bo'an
    Hydroelectric station built on the Bai Lian River, river water surging up the mountainside;
  The face of poverty and blankness has been changed, grain production has more than doubled;
  Each team uses electric lights for illumination, threshing and processing no longer need oxen to pull.
  Anti-Party elements attack the Great Leap Forward, making our stomachs burst with anger;
  We have a book of blood and tears in our hearts, class struggle is remembered in our hearts;
  Socialism is infinitely good, you are not allowed to undermine it.

    社会主义万般好
    湖北浠水钢铁大队  瞿伯安电站建在白莲河，河水滚滚上山坡；
  一穷二白面貌改，粮食增产两倍多；队队照明用电灯，脱粒加工不用牛拖。反党分子攻击大跃进，把我们肚子都气破；胸中有本血泪账，阶级斗争记心窝；社会主义万般好，不准你们挖墙脚。
