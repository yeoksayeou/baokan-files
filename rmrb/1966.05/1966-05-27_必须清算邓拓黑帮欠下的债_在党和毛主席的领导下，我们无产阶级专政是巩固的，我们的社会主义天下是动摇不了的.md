    We Must Settle the Debt Owed by the Deng Tuo Gang
    Under the Leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, Our Proletarian Dictatorship is Consolidated, and Our Socialist World Cannot Be Shaken
    Liu Zhengliang, Representative to the National People's Congress, Leader of the Masonry Group, Sixth Construction Engineering Company, Hunan Province

    "Thirty-Six Stratagems" was the last article of the poisonous weed, "Yanshan Night Talks." Deng Tuo, that cunning fellow, saw the situation was bad and wanted to escape, but he thinks it's too easy. You owe the people so much, how could the people let you run away so easily? Debts must be repaid, and today we workers will settle the debt you owe.

    Deng Tuo, an enemy of the people, opposed the general line of socialist construction, viciously slandered our Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big," and cursed the socialist construction cause as "finished." This is lying with open eyes.

    I am a construction worker who has worked for thirty years, and I also worked for more than ten years in the old society. Everyone knows that old China was a very backward country in terms of economy and culture. Take our construction industry, for example. Most of the houses built at that time were wooden frames, and very few houses were built with bricks. I learned my craft for three years, and I still couldn't build a wall after I finished my apprenticeship. I never built a chimney in the old society, but I personally built nine in the eight years after liberation. With the development of the national economy, my technical skills improved rapidly. In particular, the apprentices I trained can do advanced technical work such as exposed aggregate finishes and tiling in just two years. From 1958 to 1960, the achievements made by our people in developing the national economy under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao were very remarkable. Were you anti-Party and anti-socialist elements asleep? The Great Leap Forward is like a magical brush, adding countless newest and most beautiful pictures to the myriad miles of the motherland. In the Yuhuating area in the southern suburbs of Changsha City, which used to be a barren mountain, more than a dozen medium-sized factories were built in just two or three years. The newly built houses after liberation are twice as large as old Changsha. I personally participated in the construction project of a nine-story building, other technically complex projects, and chimneys dozens of meters high. These buildings are clearly there, and the wind hasn't blown them away, and everyone can see them. Take the capital as an example. The Great Hall of the People, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, and the Museum of History are placed on both sides of Tiananmen Square. Didn't you see them? These projects were completed in less than a year. Whether an amateur looks at them or a professional calculates them with numbers, everyone will marvel at the high speed of these buildings. According to convention, a building like the Great Hall of the People would require one year for design, half a year for preparation, and three years for construction. If the Great Leap Forward had not liberated people's minds, who would dare to accept the arduous task of completing the design and construction within one year? I want to ask Deng Tuo, you have also attended meetings at the Great Hall of the People, have you seen such a large-scale, advanced building in the old society? I have also attended several meetings in this hall. In the old society, not to mention building such a project, I had never even seen it. Is this "bragging" or "talking big"? It is not us who are hitting our heads against the iron facts, but you, a gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who distort the facts and tell lies with your eyes open.

    Our motherland achieved great achievements in the years of the Great Leap Forward, which is exciting. These achievements are of great and far-reaching significance for establishing an independent, complete, and modern national economic system in our country. Chairman Mao pointed out as early as the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "The speed of China's economic construction will not be very slow but may be quite fast, and China's prosperity can be counted on the agenda." Our motherland is getting stronger year by year. We have Daqing and Dazhai, we produced a 12,000-ton hydraulic press, and recently we successfully conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials. These countless victories are the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the general line, and fully demonstrate the spirit of our Great Leap Forward. I want to warn Deng Tuo that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our proletarian dictatorship is consolidated, and our socialist world cannot be shaken. You, a small maggot, cannot overturn a big millstone.

### 必须清算邓拓黑帮欠下的债  在党和毛主席的领导下，我们无产阶级专政是巩固的，我们的社会主义天下是动摇不了的

    必须清算邓拓黑帮欠下的债
    在党和毛主席的领导下，我们无产阶级专政是巩固的，我们的社会主义天下是动摇不了的
    全国人民代表大会代表湖南省第六建筑工程公司泥工组长  刘正良
    《“三十六计”》是《燕山夜话》这株大毒草的最后一篇文章。邓拓这个狡猾的家伙，见势不妙想逃跑，想得太容易了。欠下人民这么多账，人民怎么会让你轻易地跑掉呢？欠债是要偿还的，今天，我们工人要清算你欠下的这笔债。
    与人民为敌的邓拓，反对社会主义建设总路线，恶毒地污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，咒骂社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了。这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    我是干了三十年活的建筑工人，在旧社会里，也干了十多年。谁都知道，旧中国是一个在经济上和文化上非常落后的国家。就拿我们建筑业讲，那时候建的房屋，多半都是木架子的，用砖砌的房屋很少。我学三年手艺，出师后还不会砌墙。旧社会我没有建筑过烟囱，在解放后八年中，我亲手建筑了九个。随着国民经济的发展，我的技术进步很快。特别是我带的一批学徒，只两年，就能干粉洗石子、贴磁砖这些高级技术活了。一九五八年到一九六○年，我国人民在党中央和毛主席英明领导下，在发展国民经济中所取得的成就，是十分显著的。难道你们这些反党反社会主义分子睡觉了吗？大跃进象一支神奇的彩笔，为祖国万里江山，增添了无数最新最美的图画。我们长沙市南郊雨花亭一带，原来都是一片荒山，两三年内就建了十几个中型工厂。解放后，新建的房子有两个旧长沙那么大。我亲身参加了九层高的大楼建设工程，技术复杂的其他工程和几十米高的烟囱等。这些建筑物，明明地摆着，风又没吹走，谁都看得到。再拿首都来说，人民大会堂、中国革命博物馆、历史博物馆，摆在天安门广场两边，你没看见吗？这些工程，不到一年的时间就建成了，无论是外行用眼看，内行人用数字计算，谁也要惊叹这批建筑的高速度。象人民大会堂这样的建筑，按照常规，总要一年设计，半年准备，三年施工。如果不是大跃进解放了人们的思想，有谁敢于接受一年内设计、施工全部完成这样的艰巨任务？我要问邓拓，你也到人民大会堂开过会，这样规模宏大，设备先进的建筑，你在旧社会看见过吗？我也在这个大会堂开过几次会，在旧社会这样的工程，莫说建，连看都没看见过。这难道是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？在铁的事实面前碰得头破血流的不是我们，正是你们这一伙颠倒黑白，睁着眼睛说瞎话的反党反社会主义分子。
    我们的祖国在大跃进年代里获得伟大的成就，令人兴奋。这些成就，对于在我国建立一个独立的完整的现代化的国民经济体系，具有重大的深远的意义。毛主席早就在七届二中全会指出：“中国经济建设的速度将不是很慢而可能是相当地快的，中国的兴盛是可以计日程功的。”我们的祖国一年比一年强大，有了大庆、有了大寨，我们生产了一万二千吨的水压机，最近又成功地进行了含有热核材料的核爆炸。这数不清的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是总路线的胜利，也充分显示了我们大跃进的气魄。我要警告邓拓，我们在党和毛主席英明领导下，无产阶级专政是巩固的，我们的社会主义天下是动摇不了的。你这只小小的蛆虫，是拱不翻大石磨的。
