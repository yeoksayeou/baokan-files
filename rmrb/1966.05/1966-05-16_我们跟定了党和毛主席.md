    We are Determined to Follow the Party and Chairman Mao
    Deng Tuo attacked Mao Zedong Thought because he was a reactionary. We working people love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we want to imprint every sentence of Chairman Mao's words in our hearts, and attach our hearts to the revolutionary cause.
    Yang Fuzhen, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Weaving Worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1
    After reading Deng Tuo's "black words" against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, I felt both angry and hateful! Deng Tuo's words were poisonous arrows shot at the Party and our lifeline, every sentence trying to undermine the foundation of socialism, and every sentence trying to implement capitalist restoration in China. Our working class will always be heart to heart with the Party and Chairman Mao. Deng Tuo's attack on the Party and Chairman Mao is an attack on our working class, and we must resolutely strike back.
    Deng Tuo said that our Party is "untrustworthy" and "reneges on its promises," trying to provoke the relationship between our Party and the masses. We say: You are daydreaming. We are determined to follow the Party and Chairman Mao, and that will not change even if the sky falls and the earth cracks. Before liberation, my grandfather, grandmother, father, mother, and younger brother all died of schistosomiasis, leaving only me in the family. At fourteen, I drifted to Shanghai to work, toiling like an animal, yet not even living like one. At that time, those bourgeois masters and "professor" gentlemen, who cared about us! Only the Party and Chairman Mao led us in making revolution, establishing the working class's political power, and letting the working people be masters of their own affairs. Only Chairman Mao understands the thoughts of our working people the most, is the most considerate of our working people's suffering, and everything he does is for our working people. He put forward the great call to cure our working people of schistosomiasis. When he saw that we had been cured, he was so happy that he couldn't sleep, and he wrote a poem overnight called "Farewell to the God of Plague." When I saw the movie "Farewell to the God of Plague," I cried while watching it. I felt that Chairman Mao is truly the most intimate benefactor of our working people.
    The old society ruined my family, and the Party and Chairman Mao gave me a happy life. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, how can I not hate the bourgeois masters; how can I not love the Party, love the great leader Chairman Mao! Deng Tuo, you want us to take the road of regression, absolutely impossible!
    Our workers love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, not only because individuals have been liberated. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for the Chinese people to carry out socialist revolution and construction, and also the beacon guiding the world's people's revolution. With Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese revolution will be victorious, and the construction cause will be prosperous. After reading Chairman Mao's books, my heart is bright and my eyes are clear, and I am full of energy. I am in charge of thirty-six looms, my heart is closely connected with the world revolution, and after reading Chairman Mao's books, I have become smarter and the cloth is woven better.
    Deng Tuo, why did you attack and slander Mao Zedong Thought so viciously?! Because Mao Zedong Thought is firing at you, at all the demons and monsters at home and abroad, is to completely bury you reactionaries, and is to guide our Chinese and world working people to complete liberation. You attack Mao Zedong Thought because you are a reactionary, and you are trembling with fear. We working people must study Chairman Mao's books even more seriously, imprint every sentence of Chairman Mao's words in our hearts, and attach our hearts to the revolutionary cause.

    我们跟定了党和毛主席
    邓拓攻击毛泽东思想，因为他是反动派。我们劳动人民就是热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，就是要把毛主席的话句句印在心上，把心贴在革命事业上
    全国人民代表大会代表、上海国棉一厂织布挡车工　杨富珍
    看了邓拓反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的“黑话”，真是又气又恨！邓拓的话，句句是向党、向我们的命根子射来的毒箭，句句是要挖社会主义的墙脚，句句是想在中国实行资本主义复辟。我们工人阶级永远和党、和毛主席心连心。邓拓攻击党、攻击毛主席，就是攻击我们工人阶级，我们要坚决回击。
    邓拓说我们党“不堪信任”、“自食其言”，想挑拨我们党和群众的关系。我们说：你这是痴心妄想。我们跟定了党和毛主席，天塌地陷也不变。解放前，我的祖父、祖母、父亲、母亲、弟弟都死于血吸虫病，一家死得只剩我一个人。我十四岁就流落到上海做工，牛马一样地干，还过不到牛马的生活。那时，那些资产阶级老爷和“教授”先生们，谁来管过我们！只有党和毛主席，带领我们闹革命，建立起了工人阶级的政权，让劳动人民当家作主人。只有毛主席，最了解我们劳动人民的心思，最体贴我们劳动人民苦痛，他做的事桩桩为的我们劳动人民。他提出了为我们劳动人民治好血吸虫病的伟大号召。他看到我们治好了病，高兴得睡不着觉，连夜写了一首诗《送瘟神》。我看了《送瘟神》这个电影，一边看一边流泪，我感到毛主席真是我们劳动人民最最知心的恩人。
    旧社会害得我家破人亡，党和毛主席给了我幸福的生活。想想过去，比比现在，我怎么能不痛恨资产阶级老爷；怎么能不热爱党，热爱伟大的领袖毛主席！邓拓，你想要我们走回头路，绝对办不到！
    我们工人热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，不只是因为个人获得了解放。毛泽东思想是中国人民进行社会主义革命和建设的灯塔，也是指引世界人民革命的灯塔。有了毛泽东思想，中国革命就胜利，建设事业就兴旺。读了毛主席的书，我的心明眼亮，浑身是劲，挡的是三十六台布机，心与世界革命紧紧贴在一起，读了毛主席的书，我人变得更加聪明，布也织得更好了。
    邓拓，你为什么要那么恶毒地攻击和诬蔑毛泽东思想？！就因为毛泽东思想是向你们、向国内外一切牛鬼蛇神开火的，是要彻底埋葬你们这些反动派的，是要引导我们中国和世界劳动人民彻底解放的。你攻击毛泽东思想，因为你是反动派，你害怕得发抖了。我们劳动人民就越要把毛主席的书学得更认真，把毛主席的话，句句印在心上，把心贴在革命事业上。
