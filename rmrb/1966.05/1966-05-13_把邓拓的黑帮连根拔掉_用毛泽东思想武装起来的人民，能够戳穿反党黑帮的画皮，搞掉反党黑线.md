    Uproot Deng Tuo's Gang Completely
    People Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Can Pierce Through the Disguise of Anti-Party Gangs and Eliminate Anti-Party Black Lines
    Guangzhou
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals in Guangzhou City have continued to fire at Deng Tuo and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements with even more concentrated firepower in recent days, and have vehemently denounced "Qianxian" ("Frontline") and "Beijing Ribao" ("Beijing Daily") for the tricks they play to cover up for Deng Tuo.
    Workers from various industries in the city who are studying at the City Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School, with hearts full of anger, fiercely opened fire on Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang. They said that we will never forget the suffering we endured under the oppression of the three great mountains before liberation, and we also know how to cherish today's happy life. Deng Tuo's attempt to slander and obliterate the achievements of socialist construction led by the Party will never succeed. Many workers angrily pointed out that Deng Tuo's vicious attacks on our great Party and the socialist system are exactly the same as the tones of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. This shows that the enemy will never automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and they will always try every means to attack us. We must be a hundred times more vigilant.
    Some cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou City (Army, Navy, and Air Force) held a symposium. The cadres and soldiers who participated in the symposium were all filled with righteous indignation and spoke enthusiastically. Zhang Sheng, a "Five-Good Soldier," pointed out that no matter what cloak Deng Tuo's black gang wears, no matter how viciously they curse and attack us, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought can pierce through his disguise, smash his attacks, and thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. "Qianxian" and "Beijing Ribao" vainly attempt to help Deng Tuo get away with it, but they will absolutely not succeed. The cadres and soldiers who participated in the symposium pointed out: Revolutionary fighters resolutely take up guns in one hand and pens in the other, stand at the forefront of the struggle, resolutely defeat Deng Tuo's black gang, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.
    Members of the Dengfeng Brigade of the Shahe Commune in the suburbs used the facts of the brigade's production development to refute Deng Tuo's attack on the Great Leap Forward. Brigade member Liang Xichao said that our brigade laid a good foundation during the Great Leap Forward. Now our water conservancy has passed the test, ensuring harvests despite drought or flood, and we have also reclaimed more than 200 mu of mountain land, and the income of the members has greatly increased compared to the past. If we hadn't used the spirit of the Great Leap Forward to engage in farmland water conservancy construction at that time, could we have achieved such results now?
    The members also pointed out: We poor and lower-middle peasants want to be masters of our own affairs, and we will never allow landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements to talk nonsense and act recklessly, and we will never allow demons and monsters to stir up trouble.
    Many young activists in studying Chairman Mao's works also gathered to denounce the crimes of Deng Tuo's black gang. Guan Ya'jiu, a young worker at the Guangzhou Chemical Plant, spoke at the meeting about the tragic situation in the old society where his family was destroyed and displaced by the torture of landlords and reactionaries. He said: "Who is my enemy and who is my loved one, I know best. Deng Tuo's black gang is trying to drive our Party off the stage and let landlords and capitalists ride on our heads again, we will never allow it. I will definitely follow the Party closely, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and resolutely fight Deng Tuo's black gang to the end until they are uprooted!"

    把邓拓的黑帮连根拔掉
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，能够戳穿反党黑帮的画皮，搞掉反党黑线
    广州
    广州市广大工农兵群众和革命知识分子，连日继续以更加集中的火力向邓拓等反党反社会主义分子开火，并痛斥《前线》、《北京日报》为邓拓打掩护所耍的花招。
    正在市总工会干部学校学习的本市各行业工人，怀着满腔怒火，向邓拓反党反社会主义黑帮猛烈开火。他们说，我们永远不会忘记解放前在三座大山压迫下所受的苦难，也懂得珍惜今天幸福的生活。邓拓企图污蔑和抹煞党领导我们取得的社会主义建设成就，永远办不到。许多工人愤怒地指出，邓拓对我们伟大的党和社会主义制度的恶毒攻击，同帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的腔调一模一样。这可以看出，敌人决不会自动退出历史舞台，他们总是要千方百计地向我们进攻的，我们一定要百倍提高警惕。
    解放军驻广州市陆、海、空军的一些干部、战士，举行了座谈会。参加座谈会的干部、战士个个义愤填膺，踊跃发言。五好战士张胜指出，不管邓拓黑帮披着什么外衣，对我们进行多么恶毒的咒骂和攻击，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众能够戳穿他的画皮，粉碎他的进攻，彻底搞掉反党、反社会主义的黑线。《前线》、《北京日报》妄图掩护邓拓混过关，绝对办不到。参加座谈的干部、战士指出：革命战士坚决一手拿枪、一手拿笔，站在斗争前列，坚决打垮邓拓黑帮，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    市郊沙河公社登峰大队社员用大队生产发展的事实，驳斥了邓拓对大跃进的攻击。社员梁西潮说，我们大队是大跃进时打好基础的。现在我们水利过了关，旱涝保收，还开垦了二百多亩山地，社员的收入比过去大大增加。如果那时不是用大跃进的精神来搞农田水利建设，现在能取得这样的成绩吗？
    社员们还指出：我们贫农下中农要当家作主，决不容许地、富、反、坏乱说乱动，决不容许牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪。
    许多青年学习毛主席著作积极分子也集会声讨邓拓黑帮的罪行。广州化工厂青年工人关亚九在会上，讲他在旧社会被地主反动派折磨得家破人亡、颠沛流离的惨状。他说：“谁是我的敌人，谁是我的亲人，我最清楚。邓拓黑帮企图把我们党赶下台，让地主资本家重新骑在我们头上，我们绝不容许。我一定紧跟党走，听毛主席的话，坚决和邓拓黑帮斗争到底，直到把他们连根拔掉！”
