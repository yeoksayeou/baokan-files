    The "Three-Family Village" black gang stands on the same line as the imperialists, revisionists, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rightists, breathing through the same nostril. We must implement "hegemony" towards this gang of demons and monsters.
    Cheng Manlin, Militia Soldier of the Dongcheng District Service Company, Beijing
    In his article "The Way of Kings and the Way of Hegemons," Deng Tuo pointed fingers and cursed us with gnashing teeth, saying that our proletarian dictatorship was implementing "hegemony" and was an autocratic dictatorship. He viciously attacked our beloved Party for exercising dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, saying that it was "relying on power and influence, acting arrogantly, and giving peremptory orders," and slandered our Party's policies of depriving the feudal landlord class of its land, confiscating bureaucratic capital, and carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce as "obtaining by trickery." He cursed our beloved Party and proletarian dictatorship as "unpopular and making enemies everywhere." Seeing his imposing manner, he simply wished he could swallow our Party and the working people in one gulp.
    Why does Deng Tuo regard our Party and the proletarian dictatorship as a thorn in his side and a thorn in his flesh? Originally, there was his own suffering involved. Because our Party and the People's Government are the biggest obstacles to their counter-revolutionary plan to restore capitalism and the old China. Isn't that so? Internationally, the modern revisionists represented by Khrushchev have been defeated by our Party and have become a mangy dog that has fallen into the water, stinking in front of the revolutionary people of the world; domestically, the demons and monsters such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have also been subjected to proletarian dictatorship, deprived of their political rights, and their right to speak has been revoked; within the Party, the right opportunists were beaten back by our Party and removed from office by the people as soon as they showed their heads. And the above-mentioned demons and monsters, the enemies despised by the revolutionary people, are precisely the sworn brothers of Deng Tuo and their "Three-Family Village" black shop, and precisely the thugs of all kinds in their "holy alliance." Comrades, please think carefully: given all of this, how could Deng Tuo, the head shopkeeper of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, not hate our beloved Party and the proletarian dictatorship to the bone, and how could he not gnash his teeth to curse us, attack us, slander us, and use all his might to oppose us!
    Chairman Mao taught us: "If we are not opposed by the enemy, that is not good... If we are opposed by the enemy, that is good... If the enemy opposes us vigorously and describes us as utterly worthless, then that is even better, which proves that we have not only drawn a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, but also proves that our work has been very successful." Chairman Mao also said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support; whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." Correct! Our brilliant leader Chairman Mao is right! Every sentence speaks to the hearts of our proletariat, and every sentence is the truth. Deng Tuo! Didn't you say we are "hegemonic"? You are right. We can only implement "hegemony," or so-called autocratic dictatorship, towards you black gang members of the "Three-Family Village," as well as your "sworn brothers" in your "holy alliance," towards you old masters of the bourgeoisie and landlord class, towards you members of the special detachments of imperialism and modern revisionism, towards you demons and monsters! "Benevolent governance," or what you call the "way of kings," is only implemented within the people, and never implemented towards you! If it were implemented towards you, our Party and our country would change color, the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries would stage a comeback, the demons and monsters would rush out of their cages, our Communist Party members and our revolutionary masses would lose their heads; the blood of our countless revolutionary martyrs would have been shed in vain; our great socialist land would be torn apart, and the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world to win liberation would lose its direction. This is a lesson we, the proletariat and the revolutionary people, have learned at a great cost in decades of struggle. We will never forget it.
    Deng Tuo! Didn't you curse us for "obtaining by trickery"? You are right again. We will thoroughly and mercilessly "deprive" all the land of the feudal landlord class and the capital of the bureaucratic comprador! We must resolutely carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce! The reason is: the land owned by the feudal landlord class was originally reclaimed and irrigated with their own blood and sweat by the poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside over a long period of time, and was forcibly seized and plundered by the heinous landlord class through various criminal means. Therefore, it is not us who fundamentally "obtained by trickery," but precisely the feudal landlord class represented by this small group of black gang members of your "Three-Family Village." Our poor and lower-middle peasants, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have been liberated and become masters of their own affairs, and it is a matter of course to take back the land forcibly seized and plundered by the feudal landlord class. The basis for our proletariat to confiscate the capital of the bureaucratic comprador and to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce also lies in this. This is a truth that cannot be overturned by any vicious slander or attack by you and your gang of black gang members.
    Deng Tuo! Didn't you curse our Party and the proletariat for "making enemies everywhere" and "being so unpopular"? You are right about that too. We only please the people and will never satisfy you wolves in human skin! Chairman Mao taught us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." Chairman Mao taught us that "people" and "hearts" are not supra-class, but have their clear class nature. To win the hearts of the proletariat, one cannot win the hearts of the landlords and the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao also taught us that the primary issue of the revolution must be to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves; otherwise, the revolution will end in failure. And you and your gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought black gang members of the "Three-Family Village" are standing on the same line as the imperialists, revisionists, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, breathing through the same nostril. You demons and monsters are precisely the enemies of our proletariat.
    Chairman Mao said that where there are classes, there is class struggle, and this is an objective law that is independent of people's will. You enemies are objectively present and were not deliberately "created" by our proletariat. May I ask you, Deng Tuo: did we ask you to open a black shop and engage in the evil deeds of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought? May I ask again: we have never sent a single soldier to the United States, but American imperialism has come from afar to occupy our territory of Taiwan, laid down hundreds of military bases around our country to surround us, and sent planes and warships to invade our territorial waters and airspace; did we ask them to do this? The Soviet modern revisionist group surrendered to imperialism and, taking advantage of our temporary difficulties, launched a surprise attack on us, withdrew experts, and tore up contracts; did our Party ask them to do this? No, none of them. This is determined by your and their reactionary class nature. You slander us for "making enemies everywhere," American imperialism curses us as "belligerent," and Khrushchev's modern revisionists curse us as "belligerent roosters." This fully shows that you and they are the same kind of people!
    I tell you, Deng Tuo, your delusion to reverse the wheels of history is truly "an ant trying to shake a tree, ridiculous and overestimating yourself." In the end, you can only end up being smashed to pieces and leaving a stinking reputation for ten thousand years!

    对“三家村”这伙牛鬼蛇神只能实行专政
    “三家村”黑帮是与帝国主义者、修正主义者和地富反坏右站在一条线上的，是与他们一个鼻孔出气的。我们对这伙牛鬼蛇神，必须实行“霸道”
    北京东城区服务公司民兵战士　程满麟
    邓拓在《王道和霸道》一文里，指桑骂槐，咬牙切齿地骂我们，说我们的无产阶级专政是实行“霸道”，是专制独裁。恶毒地攻击我们亲爱的党对地、富、反、坏、右实行专政是“依靠权势，蛮横逞强，颐指气使”，污蔑我们党剥夺封建地主阶级的土地、没收官僚资本和对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的政策是“巧取豪夺”。他骂我们亲爱的党和无产阶级专政“不得人心，到处树敌”。看他这副气势汹汹的架式，简直恨不得把我们的党和劳动人民一口吞下去。
    邓拓为什么把我们党和无产阶级专政视做眼中钉、肉中刺呢？原来，其中是有他自己的苦衷的。因为我们的党和人民政府是他们实现资本主义复辟和恢复旧中国的反革命计划的最大障碍。不是吗？在国际上，以赫鲁晓夫为代表的现代修正主义者，被我们的党斗垮了，已成了一条落了水的癞皮狗，在世界革命人民面前是臭不可闻；在国内，地、富、反、坏、右等牛鬼蛇神，也已经被我们无产阶级专了政，剥夺了他们的政治权利，取消了他们的发言权；在党内，右倾机会主义分子刚一露头儿，就又被我们党打退，被人民罢了官。而上述这些牛鬼蛇神，这些革命人民所不齿的敌人，正是邓拓和他们“三家村”黑店的盟兄把弟，正是他们的“神圣同盟”中的各路打手。同志们请仔细地想一想：如此种种，邓拓这个“三家村”黑店的大掌柜，怎么能会不把我们亲爱的党和无产阶级专政恨之入骨，又怎么能不咬牙切齿地骂我们、攻击我们、污蔑我们和使出吃奶的劲头儿来反对我们呢！
    毛主席教导我们说：“如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，……如若被敌人反对，那就好了，……如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”毛主席又说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”对！我们的英明的领袖毛主席说的就是对！句句说的是我们无产阶级心里的话，句句是真理。邓拓！你不是说我们“霸道”吗？你算是说对了。我们对你们“三家村”的黑帮分子，以及你们“神圣同盟”中的“盟兄盟弟”们，对你们这些资产阶级和地主阶级的老爷们，对你们这些帝国主义、现代修正主义的别动队的队员们，对你们这些牛鬼蛇神们，只能实行“霸道”，或曰专制独裁！“仁政”，或者象你所说的“王道”只实行于人民的内部，而绝不实行于你们！如若实行于你们，我们的党，我们的国家就会改变颜色，帝国主义和国民党反动派，就会卷土重来，牛鬼蛇神就会冲出笼来，我们的共产党员、我们的革命群众，就会人头落地；我们的无数革命先烈的鲜血就会白流；我们大好的社会主义的河山，就会支离破碎，世界革命人民争取解放的斗争，就会失去前进的方向。这是我们无产阶级和革命人民在几十年斗争实践中，用巨大的代价得来的一条经验。我们绝不会忘记它。
    邓拓！你不是骂我们“巧取豪夺”吗？这又算让你说对了。我们对一切封建地主阶级的土地和官僚买办的资本，就是要彻底地、毫不留情地予以剥“夺”。我们对资本主义工商业就是要坚决地实行社会主义改造！理由是：封建地主阶级所拥有的土地，本来就是农村的贫农和下中农，经过漫长的岁月，用自己的血汗开垦和浇灌出来的，是被万恶的地主阶级用各种罪恶的手段强夺硬抢过去的。因此，“巧取豪夺”的根本不是我们，而正是你们“三家村”这一小撮黑帮分子所代表的封建地主阶级。我们的贫农下中农在共产党和毛主席的领导下，翻身解放了，当家做主了，把封建地主阶级强夺硬抢过去的土地拿了回来，这是天经地义的事情。我们无产阶级没收官僚买办的资本，以及对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的根据，也在于此。这是你和你们一伙黑帮分子的任何恶毒的污蔑、攻击都无法推翻的真理。
    邓拓！你不是骂我们党和无产阶级“到处树敌”和“多么不得人心”吗？这也算让你给说对了。我们只让人民称心如意，绝不让你们这伙披着人皮的豺狼满意！毛主席教导我们说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”毛主席教导我们，“人”和“心”不是超阶级的，是有它明确的阶级性的。要得无产阶级的人心，就不能得地主和资产阶级的人心。毛主席又教导我们说：革命的首要问题，必须要分清敌我，否则，革命就会归于失败。而你和你们“三家村”这一伙反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑帮分子，是与帝国主义者、修正主义者和地、富、反、坏、右站在一条线上的，是与他们一个鼻子眼出气的，你们这些牛鬼蛇神正是我们无产阶级的敌人。
    毛主席说，有阶级，就有阶级斗争存在，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。你们这些敌人是客观存在，并不是我们无产阶级自己故意“树”的。请问你邓拓：你们开黑店，进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当，难道是我们请你这样干的吗？再请问：我们从未向美国派过一兵一卒，而美帝国主义却不远万里而来，霸占了我国领土台湾，在我国周围布下了几百个军事基地包围我们，并派遣飞机、军舰侵犯我国的领海领空，难道这也是我们请他们这样干的吗？苏联现代修正主义集团投降帝国主义，趁我们遇到暂时困难的时候，对我们进行突然袭击，撤走专家，撕毁合同，难道这也是我们党请他们这样干的吗？不是，都不是。这是你们和他们的反动的阶级本性所决定了的。你污蔑我们自己“到处树敌”，美帝国主义骂我们“好战”，赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者骂我们是“好斗的公鸡”，这就完全说明了，你们和他们是一路货色！
    我告诉你，邓拓，你们妄想使历史的巨轮倒转，真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。最后，你们只能落得个粉身碎骨，遗臭万年！
