    Smash the "Three-Family Village" and Eradicate the祸害 (plague) Thoroughly
    This gang from the "Three-Family Village" eats the food of the working people and wears the clothes of the working people, yet they oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the working people. Our poor and lower-middle peasants will absolutely not spare them!
    Chen Yike
    Delegate to the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Party Branch of Jianhua Brigade, Sanjiao Commune, Yongxiu County, Jiangxi

    Deng Tuo slanderously attacks our Party's leadership, saying it is "self-righteous and looks down on the masses." This is not only a malicious slander but also a vain attempt to sow discord between the masses and our Party, incite the masses to oppose the Party's leadership, so that their gang of demons and monsters can usurp leadership and change the color of our country, restore capitalism, and make our workers and peasants live the same exploited and enslaved life as in the old society. His intentions are extremely vicious. We poor and lower-middle peasants must not let go of this big poisonous snake and must thoroughly destroy the "Three-Family Village" black nest.
    All the poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members in our brigade say: Before liberation, working people were looked down upon for generations and had no rights whatsoever. Only the Party and Chairman Mao truly respected us working people the most and made us the true masters of the country. In the past, in which dynasty, in which era, did we peasants have our own elected representatives to manage national affairs? No. In the past, even in a small village, the working people had no say. After liberation, we truly became the masters of the country. Cadres at all levels are elected by ourselves. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that we must rely on the masses in everything, believe in the masses, and follow the mass line. Our grassroots cadres listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Take a few things from our brigade as an example. Last winter, the commune members proposed to build a small reservoir. The brigade cadres agreed. After surveying, it was decided to build it at Similong. The plan was taken to the masses for discussion. The vast majority of commune members believed that it would be better to build the reservoir at Zhongshulong than at Similong. The brigade cadres acted according to the opinions of the vast majority of the masses and changed the original plan. The second thing is that the brigade originally planned to expand cotton planting by 200 mu this year. When commune members discussed this plan, they believed that, according to the needs and possibilities of national construction, it could be expanded to 500 mu. The brigade cadres acted according to the opinions of the masses. Now, these cotton plants have not only been expanded according to the plan, but they are also growing very well. In which dynasty in the past did they respect the working people and respect the opinions of the working people like this? Absolutely not. This gang from the "Three-Family Village" eats the food of our working people, wears the clothes of our working people, but engages in activities against the Party, against socialism, and against the people. Our working people will never spare them.

    捣毁“三家村”  彻底除祸害
    “三家村”这一伙吃劳动人民的，穿劳动人民的，却反党反社会主义反劳动人民，我们贫下中农决不能饶过他们
    全国人民代表大会代表江西永修县三角公社建华大队党支部书记
    陈翊科
    邓拓含沙射影地攻击我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众。”这不但是恶毒诬蔑，而且是妄想挑拨离间群众与我们党的关系，煽动群众反对党的领导，以便他们这一伙牛鬼蛇神来篡夺领导权，使我们国家改变颜色，复辟资本主义，使我们工农群众又象旧社会一样过着被剥削、被奴役的生活。他的用心是非常恶毒的。我们贫农下中农一定不能放过这条大毒蛇，一定要把“三家村”黑巢彻底捣毁。
    我们大队所有的贫农下中农和社员群众都说：解放以前劳动人民祖祖辈辈被人看不起，没有丝毫权利。只有党和毛主席才真正最看得起我们劳动人民，使我们真正当了国家的主人翁。以前，那一朝，那一代，有我们农民自己选的代表管理国家大事的呢？没有。从前，就是在一个小村庄里也没有劳动人民说话哇事的份。解放后，我们真正作了国家的主人。各级干部都是我们自己选的。毛主席还一再教导我们，一定要事事依靠群众，相信群众，走群众路线。我们基层干部都是听毛主席的话、照毛主席的指示办事的。就拿我们大队的几件事来说吧。去冬，社员提出要修一座小水库，大队干部同意了，勘察后，决定修在寺迷垄。计划拿到群众中讨论，绝大多数社员都认为水库修在中树垄比修在寺迷垄更好，大队干部就按照绝大多数群众的意见办事，改变了原计划。第二件是，大队原打算今年扩种棉花二百亩，社员讨论这一计划时，认为根据国家建设需要和可能，可扩大五百亩。大队干部按照群众的意见办，现在这些棉花不仅按计划扩大了，而且长得很好。过去有哪个朝代这样看得起劳动人民，尊重劳动人民的意见呢？绝对没有，“三家村”这一伙东西，吃我们劳动人民的，穿我们劳动人民的，却干着反党反社会主义反人民的勾当，我们劳动人民决不能饶过他们。
