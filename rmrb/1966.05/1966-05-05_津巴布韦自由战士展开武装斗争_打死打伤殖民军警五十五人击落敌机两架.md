    According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Dar es Salaam on the 1st: Salisbury dispatch: The Zimbabwean People's Armed Forces recently killed or wounded a total of 55 military police of the Smith colonial regime in areas not far north of Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia. This marks a new development in the Zimbabwean people's struggle against the colonial regime supported by British and American imperialism and for national independence: Despite the brutal suppression by the Smith colonial regime, the flames of armed struggle have been ignited by the Zimbabwean people.
    The Zimbabwe African National Union issued a statement here on April 30, saying that in the past two weeks, Zimbabwean freedom fighters have launched fierce attacks on the Smith regime. The statement said that in recent fighting in Sinoia, a tobacco growing area about 85 miles north of Salisbury, 25 white colonial military police were killed and 30 were wounded. Freedom fighters also shot down two helicopters of the colonial regime.
    A spokesman for the Smith colonial regime's police department admitted that these helicopters were sent to support the military police and suppress the African people, and that some Africans had been arrested.
    A statement from this organization, signed by Mukono, Public Affairs Secretary of the Zimbabwe African National Union, said that the Zimbabwean people will continue their war of liberation until the colonial regime is completely eliminated. Another statement from the organization also said: "We will fight an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and never give up our demands."

    津巴布韦自由战士展开武装斗争
    打死打伤殖民军警五十五人击落敌机两架
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆一日电　索尔兹伯里消息：津巴布韦人民武装最近在南罗得西亚首府索尔兹伯里以北不远地区，共打死打伤史密斯殖民政权的军警五十五人。这标志着，津巴布韦人民反对英美帝国主义支持的殖民政权、争取民族独立的斗争有了新的发展：不顾史密斯殖民政权的残暴镇压，津巴布韦人民已经燃起了武装斗争的火焰。
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟四月三十日在这里发表声明说，过去两星期，津巴布韦自由战士向史密斯政权发动了猛烈进攻。声明说，最近在索尔兹伯里以北八十五英里左右的烟草种植区锡诺亚发生的战斗中，二十五名白人殖民军警被打死，三十名被打伤。自由战士还打落殖民政权的两架直升飞机。
    史密斯殖民政权的警察局发言人承认，这些直升飞机是派去支援军警、镇压非洲人民的，有一些非洲人被逮捕。
    由津巴布韦非洲民族联盟公共事务书记穆科诺签署的这一组织的一项声明说，津巴布韦人民将继续他们的解放战争，直到殖民政权被彻底消灭为止。这个组织在另一项声明中还说：“我们将进行以眼还眼、以牙还牙的斗争，决不放弃要求。”
