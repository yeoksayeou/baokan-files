    Launch a War Against the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Black Line
    Cook of the Capital Machinery Factory Zhou Jingeng
  During the day, we wield iron hammers, picks, and guns,
  Adding tiles and bricks to socialist construction;
  At night, we pick up the great pen of the Cultural Revolution,
  To wage war against the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line!
  We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force in the three great revolutionary movements,
  We are heroic men who stand tall in socialist construction.
  The Party and Chairman Mao lead us in making revolution,
  The beautiful socialist country is created by our own hands!
  Anyone who wants to destroy our every blade of grass and every tree,
  We will cut off its claws!
  We are workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought,
  We never show weakness in the face of enemies at home and abroad!
  If you don't hit the enemy, he won't fall,
  If all bad things are not criticized, they will run rampant;
  Drag the demons and monsters out to see the sunlight,
  Let them taste the demon-slaying sword of our workers, peasants, and soldiers!
  Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought,
  Standing at the forefront of the socialist cultural revolution,
  Never stop fighting until complete victory,
  Firmly protect our great socialist country!

    向反党反社会主义的黑线开战
    首都机械厂炊事员　周金更
  白天，咱挥舞着铁锤，铁镐，枪杆，
  为社会主义建设添瓦加砖；
  夜晚，咱拿起文化革命的大笔，
  向反党反社会主义的黑线开战！
  咱工农兵是三大革命运动中的主力军，
  是社会主义建设中顶天立地的英雄汉。
  党和毛主席领导着咱们干革命，
  社会主义的美好江山是咱亲手创建！
  谁要想破坏咱的一草一木，
  咱就要将它的魔爪斩断！
  我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，
  面对国内外的敌人从不示软！
  对敌人不打他不会倒，
  一切坏东西不批判它就泛滥；
  把牛鬼蛇神拉出来见见阳光，
  让它尝尝咱工农兵的斩妖剑！
  更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，
  站在社会主义文化革命的最前线，
  不获全胜决不收兵，
  牢牢保住咱社会主义的大好河山！
