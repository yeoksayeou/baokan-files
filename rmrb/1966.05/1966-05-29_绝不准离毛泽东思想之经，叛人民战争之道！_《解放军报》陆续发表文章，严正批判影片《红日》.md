    Absolutely No Deviation from the Sutra of Mao Zedong Thought, No Betrayal of the Path of People's War!
    The "People's Liberation Army Daily" Continues to Publish Articles Seriously Criticizing the Film "Red Sun"
    Since May 14th, the "People's Liberation Army Daily" has continuously published readers' letters, contributions, and symposium minutes, launching a serious criticism of the film "Red Sun." These letters, contributions, and the speeches of witnesses to the Liberation War—Comrades Luo Huang, Zhang Pengzhan, Liu Xiangzhi, Gao Shiliang, Li Peng, and Zheng Keliang, who participated in the Menglianggu Campaign—at the symposium, unanimously believe that the film "Red Sun" is a poisonous weed that vigorously praises and celebrates the enemy, sets up monuments for them, and viciously attacks the people's war and the people's army. It is a piece of bourgeois black goods that deviates from the sutra of Mao Zedong Thought and betrays the path of people's war.
    
    Writing an "Honorable History" for the Kuomintang Reactionary Army, Erecting a "Monument of Merit" for the Butchers Who Slaughtered the People
    Many comrades pointed out that the directors and writers of the film "Red Sun," standing on a reactionary position, portrayed the anti-communist and anti-people Kuomintang army as a "mighty and majestic" "heroic" force, and dressed the butcher Zhang Lingfu as a "perfect" "heroic" figure, thus carrying out a comprehensive and shameless eulogy of the enemy army.
    
    Zheng Keliang, Deputy Division Commander of a certain unit, and Luo Huang, Director of the Propaganda Department of a certain unit, pointed out that this film, whether in terms of camera angles, picture design, character dialogue, or musical effects, is all about praising the enemy. The enemy's morale is "vigorous," their "determination to serve the Party and the country" is "resolute," their unity from top to bottom is "sincere," and their discipline is "immaculate," making them appear as a "benevolent army." We ask, on which class's bench are the directors and writers sitting?
    
    Comrade Luo Huang pointed out that the directors and writers of the film, in order to beautify and praise Zhang Lingfu, commander of the enemy's 74th Division, exhausted all means of fabrication. Zhang Lingfu's every word and action in the film is so "heroic." Every battle is "resourceful," and after being besieged by our army in Menglianggu, he is still "calm and composed" and "tenacious." In the end, this butcher was killed by our army, and the film also erected an image of him as "though dead, still alive." At this time, the film deliberately lets a red sun burst forth. We ask the directors and writers, for whom is this "red sun" rising? Aren't you blatantly praising Zhang Lingfu's "spirit is immortal"?
    
    Zheng Keliang and Zhang Pengzhan, Deputy Political Commissar of a certain unit, pointed out that the Menglianggu Campaign was carried out after our Subei, Lunan, and Laiwu campaigns had achieved great victories. The enemy's 74th Division suffered heavy blows from our army along the way, with heavy losses in personnel and equipment, and its morale was greatly diminished, with no confidence in the future of the anti-people civil war. Even Zhang Lingfu himself was very pessimistic and had repeatedly requested the puppet Ministry of National Defense to transfer the division to Nanjing for reorganization, and had submitted several reports requesting sick leave, all of which were not approved, and his mood was very low. How could he be as arrogant as portrayed in the film? The historical facts are like this, but the directors and writers insisted on writing a biography and composing music for him. As for the enemy's 74th Division, it was not at all as portrayed in the film, "either success or death." Just after the Menglianggu battle ended, we found several thousand enemy soldiers in the cracks of the rocks. Their mouths were very quick to beg for mercy, and their movements to surrender were very skilled. Isn't this enough to refute the fabrications of the directors and writers? All reactionaries, whether they are ace troops or main forces, are all harmful to the people and outwardly strong but inwardly weak. However, the film "Red Sun" conceals the reactionary nature of the enemy and vigorously beautifies Zhang Lingfu and his 74th Division. Isn't this deliberately trying to blur the line between our people's love and hate?
    
    Vigorously Distorting the Essence of the People's Army, Comprehensively Vilifying the Heroic Image of Our Army
    On the one hand, the film beautifies the enemy army, and on the other hand, it carries out a comprehensive and vicious slander against our army. Liu Xiangzhi, Director of the Political Department of a certain division, said that our army is the people's army, and every member understands the fundamental principle of for whom to be a soldier and for whom to fight. However, the film first of all tries to distort this fundamental issue. It portrays our cadres and soldiers as a group of people who do not know for whom they are fighting and who have serious narrow regional concepts. Once they leave their hometown and transfer to Shandong, they are ideologically blocked, each one drooping, and full of complaints. The film viciously fabricated the pessimistic and disappointed spirit of the troops when they marched into Shandong.
    
    Comrade Gao Shiliang, Deputy Chief of Staff of a certain army, said that in the depiction of our army's morale, the film initially formed a sharp contrast with the enemy's high morale. The Battle of Lianshui wrote that our army was vulnerable and fled in panic, and the shots were full of chaos as the troops and the masses squeezed and bumped into each other. This is malicious slander. In those years, before the Lianshui Campaign, the East China Field Army resolutely followed Chairman Mao's strategic policy and annihilated more than 56,000 enemy soldiers in less than two months. Later, it transferred to various places and achieved one victory after another. Who is the winner and who is the loser, history has already witnessed. The directors and writers completely disregarded the historical facts and arbitrarily slandered and distorted our army. What is their intention?
    
    Secondly, the film portrays the cadres at all levels of our army as mediocre and incompetent people without political minds, without proletarian consciousness, and without knowledge of military strategy. Senior commander, Army Commander Shen Zhenxin, is at a loss in the face of the crazy enemy, hesitating in his command; and in the case of the so-called "battle failure," he is burdened with ideological baggage, discouraged, and "heavy-hearted." The army political commissar is a "clay bodhisattva" who only fans a fan and has no ideas. Regiment Commander Liu Sheng only knows how to fight and does not ask about politics, and his mind is full of purely military viewpoints. In particular, Company Commander Shi Donggen is an even more vigorously vilified character. He has no mind, does not talk about tactics, and fights only with blood and courage. He is addicted to alcohol and dizzy in the face of victory. He is undisciplined, suppresses democracy, and disrupts battlefield discipline. In short, the film portrays our army as not resembling a revolutionary force, which is absolutely intolerable!
    
    Negating the Leading Role of the Party, Slandering the Political Work of Our Army
    Comrade Zhang Pengzhan said that the film does not reflect the Party's leadership of our army from beginning to end. In the film, we cannot see the Party's meetings, we cannot hear the Party's voice, and it insidiously cancels all the Party's activities and roles. And for the only two representatives of the Party—the army political commissar and the regimental political commissar—it painstakingly vilifies them as supporting roles and clowns, "clay bodhisattvas." Many places in the film have removed the Party's leadership, and military cadres such as the army commander and the regimental commander act arbitrarily. When fierce battles are coming, the regimental political commissar just stands next to the regimental commander and says: "Fighting still depends on you!" Isn't this completely supporting and approving purely military viewpoints and fundamentally negating the Party's leadership of the army?
    
    Shen Wenzhang, Director of the Political Department of the Army, said: Chairman Mao taught us: "The committee system is an important system of the Party to ensure collective leadership and prevent individual monopoly." ... But the film promotes the "one-leader system" and cancels the Party's leadership. From the army to the company, we cannot see a single Party organization meeting. This is promoting the bourgeois military line that without the Party's leadership and without the Party's political work, the army can also fight.
    
    Comrade Li Peng, Chief of Staff of a certain division, said: From beginning to end, the film does not see the infusion of progressive political spirit and the action to implement this infusion. On the contrary, it replaces political work with simple administrative orders, replaces ideological education with rude reprimands, and replaces the lofty ideals of the proletariat with vulgar and low-level tastes. In short, political and ideological work has neither principle nor flexibility. When the troops are transferred and the soldiers cannot understand the strategic transfer, how does the army political commissar do political work? He just says how good Shandong is, "there are springs everywhere," there are Jiaodong apples, and Feicheng's "Yixianhong" peaches... What is this political work? This is not proletarian political work, but precisely bourgeois political work.
    
    Viciously Distorting Chairman Mao's Thought on People's War
    Comrade Huang Yao said: The Liberation War was a great people's war conducted by the people's army under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the directors and writers of the film portrayed our army as an army that does not understand the strategic and tactical principles of people's war. After the Lianshui blocking battle completed its mission, in order to better annihilate the enemy, our army took the initiative to retreat, but the film portrayed our army's initiative to withdraw from Lianshui as a rout and a desperate escape, as if it was not our army's initiative to withdraw, but because we had been defeated and had to withdraw. Not only that, the film also wrote this retreat as something that our army could not understand from top to bottom, and everyone was full of complaints... Since this unit knows so little about Chairman Mao's military thought, then is it still the People's Liberation Army?
    
    People's war must realize the combination of the main force, the local army, and guerrilla warfare, but the Liberation War under the pen of the directors and writers is a war in which the main force is solely relied upon to sing a solo. In this war, we cannot see the support and help of the people for our army, and we cannot see the people's guerrilla warfare cooperating with our army. Zhang Lingfu's army entered our base area without the resistance of the armed people. They could enter and retreat as they pleased, as if they were in no man's land.
    
    Chairman Mao said: "The revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." However, the film completely distorts Chairman Mao's thought.

### 绝不准离毛泽东思想之经，叛人民战争之道！  《解放军报》陆续发表文章，严正批判影片《红日》

    绝不准离毛泽东思想之经，叛人民战争之道！
    《解放军报》陆续发表文章，严正批判影片《红日》
    五月十四日以来，《解放军报》陆续发表读者来信、来稿及座谈纪要，对影片《红日》展开了严肃的批判。这些来信、来稿，以及解放战争的见证人——参加过孟良崮战役的罗璜、张鹏展、刘祥之、高士亮、李鹏、郑克良等同志在座谈会上的发言，都一致认为：影片《红日》是一部竭力为敌人歌功颂德、立传树碑，恶毒地攻击人民战争、人民军队的毒草，是离毛泽东思想之经、叛人民战争之道的资产阶级黑货。
    替国民党反动军队谱“光荣史”  为屠杀人民的刽子手树“纪功碑”
    许多同志指出：影片《红日》的编导者站在反动立场上，把反共反人民的国民党军队描绘成一支“威武雄壮”的“英雄”部队，把刽子手张灵甫打扮成一个“完美无缺”的“英雄”人物，从而对敌军进行了全面的、无耻的歌颂。
    某部副师长郑克良、某部宣传处处长罗璜指出：这部影片不论是镜头的角度，画面的设计，人物的对话，音乐的效果，都是为敌人歌功颂德的。影片中敌人士气之“旺盛”，“为党国效忠”之“坚决”，上下之“精诚团结”，纪律之“秋毫无犯”，俨然是“王道之师”。试问，编导者的屁股究竟坐到哪一个阶级的板凳上去了？
    罗璜同志指出：影片编导者为了美化和歌颂敌军七十四师师长张灵甫，极尽捏造之能事。影片中张灵甫的一言一行，都是那么“雄姿英发”。每一次战斗，都是“足智多谋”，被我军围困在孟良崮后，依然“镇定自若”、“顽强不屈”。最后，这个刽子手被我军打死了，影片还为他树立起“虽死犹生”的形象。这时影片特意让一轮红日喷薄而出。请问编导者，你的这轮“红日”究竟是为谁而升起的呢？你们不是明目张胆地颂扬张灵甫“精神不死”吗？
    郑克良和某部副政委张鹏展指出：孟良崮战役，是继我宿北、鲁南、莱芜战役取得巨大胜利之后进行的。敌七十四师在我军一路几次沉重的打击下，人员和武器装备损失很大，士气大为低落，对反人民内战的前途毫无信心。就是张灵甫本人也很悲观，曾几次要求伪国防部将该师调往南京整训，又打了几次报告，要求请假养病，都未获准，情绪很低落，怎么能象影片中所描写的那样趾高气扬呢？历史事实就是这样的，编导者却偏偏为他立传谱曲。至于敌七十四师部队，也根本不是象影片所描写的那样，“不成功则成仁”，孟良崮战斗刚结束，我们在石缝里搜出敌士兵好几千，他们求饶的嘴非常勤快，投降的动作非常熟练，这难道还不足以驳斥编导者的捏造吗？一切反动派，不论是王牌也好，主力也好，都是残害人民的，外强中干的。而影片《红日》却掩盖了敌人的反动本质，竭力美化张灵甫和他的七十四师，这不是蓄意要模糊我们人民的爱憎界限吗？
    极力歪曲人民军队的本质  全面丑化我军的英雄形象
    影片一方面美化敌军，一方面对我军进行全面、恶毒的污蔑。某师政治部主任刘祥之说：我们的军队是人民的军队，每个成员都懂得为谁当兵，为谁打仗的根本道理。可是影片首先在这个根本问题上竭力加以歪曲。它把我们的干部战士描写成为一群不知为谁而战，存在着严重的狭隘地域观念的人。一旦离开家乡，转战山东时，便思想不通，一个个垂头丧气，牢骚满腹。影片恶毒地捏造了部队向山东进军时那种悲观失望的精神面貌。
    某军副参谋长高士亮同志说：在描写我军的士气方面，影片一开始就与敌人的高昂士气形成鲜明的对比。涟水之战，把我军写成不堪一击，仓皇逃跑，镜头里尽是部队与群众你挤我撞的一片混乱局面。这是恶意的诽谤。当年，华东野战军在涟水战役以前，坚决遵循毛主席的战略方针，不到两个月，共歼敌五万六千余人，以后，又转战各地，取得了一个又一个的胜利，究竟谁是胜利者，谁是失败者，历史早有见证，编导者全然不顾历史事实，对我军任意污蔑和歪曲，其用心何在？
    其次，影片把我军的各级干部，描写成为没有政治头脑，没有无产阶级觉悟，不识军事韬略，庸庸碌碌的无能之辈。高级指挥员军长沈振新，在疯狂的敌人面前，一筹莫展，指挥犹豫不决；而在所谓“战役失利”的情况下，又背上了思想包袱，灰心丧气、“心情沉重”。军政委呢，是一个光搧扇子，没有主意的“泥菩萨”。团长刘胜只知打仗，不问政治，脑子里充满着单纯军事观点。特别是连长石东根，更是个被竭力丑化了的人物。他没有头脑，不讲战术，打仗只凭血气之勇。他嗜酒成性，在胜利面前晕头转向。他自由散漫，压制民主，破坏战场纪律。总之，影片把我军描写得不象一支革命队伍，这是决不能容忍的！
    否定党的领导作用  诬蔑我军的政治工作
    张鹏展同志说：影片自始至终不反映党对我军的领导。影片中，看不见党的会议，听不见党的声音，阴险地取消了党的一切活动和作用。而对仅有的两个党的代表——军政委、团政委，却煞费苦心地把他们丑化成配角、丑角，“泥菩萨”。影片很多地方都抽掉了党的领导，而由军长、团长等军事干部独断独行。激战来临，团政委只是站在旁边对团长说：“打仗还要靠你呀！”这不是完全支持和赞成单纯的军事观点，从根本上否定了党对军队的领导吗？
    军政治部主任沈文章同志说：毛主席教导我们：“党委制是保证集体领导、防止个人包办的党的重要制度。”……而影片却宣扬了“一长制”，取消了党的领导。从军到连，看不到一次党组织会议。这是宣扬没有党的领导，没有党的政治工作，军队也能打仗的资产阶级军事路线。
    某师参谋长李鹏同志说：影片从头到尾，丝毫看不到进步的政治精神的贯注，和执行这种贯注的行动。而恰恰相反，是以简单的行政命令代替政治工作，以粗暴的训斥代替思想教育，以庸俗、低级的趣味代替了无产阶级的远大理想。总之，政治思想工作既没有原则性，又没有灵活性。当部队转移，战士对战略转移想不通时，军政委是怎样去做政治工作的呢？他只是说山东那地方如何好，“到处有泉水”，有胶东的苹果，肥城“一线红”的桃子……。这是什么政治工作，这不是无产阶级的政治工作，而恰恰是资产阶级的政治工作。
    恶毒歪曲毛主席人民战争的思想
    黄瑶同志说：解放战争是人民军队在毛泽东思想指导下进行的伟大的人民战争。但是，影片编导者把我军写成是一支不懂人民战争战略战术的军队。当涟水阻击战完成任务后，为了更好地消灭敌人，我军主动撤退，但影片对我军主动撤出涟水这一正确的战略行动，却描写成溃不成军，狼狈逃窜，似乎不是我军主动撤退，而是因为打了败仗，不得不撤退一样。不仅如此，影片还把这一撤退写成我军上下都想不通，个个满肚子牢骚……这个部队既然对毛主席的军事思想如此一窍不通，那么它还是不是人民解放军？
    人民战争必须实现主力军、地方军和游击战争三结合，但编导者笔下的解放战争，却是一场单纯依靠主力军唱独角戏的战争。这场战争，看不到人民群众对我军的支持和帮助，看不到人民的游击战争和我军配合，张灵甫军队进入我根据地，没有武装起来的人民的抵抗，他们是要进就进，要退就退，如入无人之境。
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”可是影片完全歪曲了毛主席这一思想。
