    Zhu Chunhua's "Innocence" Where?
    Wang Shunning, Director of the Women's Federation of the Sijiqing Commune, Beijing
    The movie "Two Stage Sisters" portrays Chunhua as a child bride who suffered the most, who "lived cleanly" after arriving in Shanghai, dared to fight against evil forces, and became a revolutionary without needing reform after liberation, seemingly different from Xing Yuehong. Xing Yuehong became the wife of a bourgeois Kuomintang special agent, while Chunhua always maintained the "true qualities" of the working people, so the author sings her praises. We fundamentally do not believe the author's nonsense; Chunhua absolutely cannot represent the exploited and oppressed working people. In my opinion, she changed after going from the countryside to Shanghai: she wore new cheongsams, ate and drank with Manager Tang, and was later hailed as a star, stuffing her pockets with piles of money, becoming a "woman of influence." Where is there even a trace of the working people's flavor?
    The film portrays Xing Yuehong's degeneration and corruption, and puts on a pretense of "criticizing" Xing Yuehong, but in reality, the directors sympathize with Yuehong. Doesn't Chunhua believe that Yuehong would do harmful things? After liberation, didn't she try every possible means to find her and sit on the same boat with her? In my opinion, Chunhua and Yuehong are essentially no different; the author has merely draped Chunhua in an enchanting painted skin. She has no class feelings for the working people, but instead possesses the affectations of the bourgeoisie. After liberation, her first thought was not to reform her thinking and serve the working people; she was not looking for Little Chunhua, the child bride who had saved her and who had once been "in the same boat as her," but rather for her former sworn sister, the current family member of a counter-revolutionary, Xing Yuehong. When she found Yuehong, the two embraced and cried bitterly, their feelings so deep they were indescribable. In contrast, when Little Chunhua came looking, she was very cold.
    A few years ago, when class enemies rampantly attacked socialism, some landlords and rich peasants in the countryside continued their family trees, and took in sworn relatives, sworn sisters, just like Chunhua and Yuehong. Class enemies attempted to use this method to destroy socialism and restore capitalism. The author of "Two Stage Sisters" is doing the same thing as them!

    竺春花“清白”在哪里？
    北京四季青公社妇联主任　王顺英
    电影《舞台姐妹》把春花写成是一个受苦、受罪最深最重的童养媳，到上海以后，一直“清清白白地做人”，敢于和邪恶势力作斗争，解放后不用改造就成了一个革命者，好象和邢月红不同。邢月红变成了资产阶级国民党特务的老婆，春花则始终保持了劳动人民的“本色”，所以作者大唱颂歌。我们根本不相信作者的鬼话，春花根本不能代表受剥削受压迫的劳动人民。我看她从乡下到上海以后就变了：穿上了新旗袍，陪着唐经理又吃又喝，后来被捧为明星，大把大把的钞票塞满了腰包，成了“风流人物”，哪里还有一点劳动人民的味道？
    影片写了邢月红的变质和堕落，对邢月红装模作样地做了点“批判”，实在编导者是同情月红的。春花不是不相信月红会干害人的坏事吗？解放后，不是又千方百计地去找她，同她坐在一条船上了吗？叫我看，春花和月红从本质上说，并没有什么两样，只不过作者给春花披了一张迷人的画皮罢了。她并没有什么劳动人民的阶级感情，有的是资产阶级的一套情调。解放后，她首先想到的，不是改造思想，为劳动人民服务；她要找的也不是救过她、曾经与她“同命相怜”的童养媳小春花，而是她过去的干妹妹、今天的反革命家属邢月红。当她找到月红时，二人抱头大哭，感情之深，无法形容。相反，小春花来找时，她却很冷淡。
    前几年，阶级敌人猖狂地向社会主义进攻的时候，农村中有的地主和富农就续家谱，拜干亲、干姐妹，正象春花和月红那样。阶级敌人就是企图用这种办法来搞垮社会主义，让资本主义复辟。《舞台姐妹》的作者，正是和他们干同样的勾当！
