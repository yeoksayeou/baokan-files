    Shanghai, our country's largest city with a glorious revolutionary tradition, was today (May 5th) immersed in joy and revolutionary passion. The cheers of "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong-Enver" echoed over this eastern giant port. More than 600,000 people, converging from all directions to the streets, greeted with profound proletarian internationalist sentiments the envoys of the heroic people who hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism – the Albanian Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Shehu.
    The people of Shanghai, striding forward on the road of revolutionization, have a deep affection and admiration for the Albanian people who are unyielding in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and welcome Enver's comrades-in-arms as if they were their own relatives. Today, people took to the streets singing revolutionary songs. Cheers and slogans accompanied by the majestic sounds of trumpets and drums made this city with a glorious revolutionary tradition festive and jubilant. Those who came to welcome had a common and strong feeling: This is not welcoming ordinary friends, but receiving the closest comrades-in-arms; this is not an ordinary welcome, but a demonstration of their determination to fight side by side with the Albanian people and carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism to the end.
    Shanghai today looks exceptionally beautiful. Huge slogans, more than a dozen stories high, were hung on many tall buildings, and archways stood on the main streets. Enthusiastic singing also came from the balconies of buildings along the route, and countless smiling faces poured out from thousands of windows. Layer upon layer of cross-street banners stretching as far as the eye could see, read: "Long live invincible Marxism-Leninism!" "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world!" "Resolutely and thoroughly oppose modern revisionism!"
    When Comrade Shehu, accompanied by Comrades Zhou Enlai and Wei Wenbo, Comrade Kabo, accompanied by Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Cao Diqiu, and Comrade Kelezi and Comrade Naser, accompanied by Comrade Ma Tianshui, drove in open cars from the airport towards the city, the welcoming crowds erupted. A large chorus composed of 6,000 amateur singers sang "Song of the Eagle" in unison. A waist drum team of more than 1,000 people made exciting drum sounds as if welcoming comrades back. Dance teams danced gracefully to the rhythmic beats. The distinguished guests waved frequently to the welcoming people, and thunderous cheers repeatedly erupted from the crowd: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!"
    The Shanghai worker contingent in the welcoming ranks, holding high red flags and waving bouquets, extended the warmest greetings to the envoys of the heroic people who dare to fight and dare to win. In the worker ranks, many people wore sparkling "Five-Good Worker" medals on their chests. Many workers came straight from work, carrying red flags. The distinguished guests' open car arrived at Huaihai Middle Road. The workers gathered here beat gongs and drums, and sang the song "Tirana-Beijing." The worker contingent from the Daqing-style enterprise – Shanghai Miniature Bearing Factory – was also here. This factory is the epitome of the Shanghai working class's victorious struggle to crush the modern revisionist conspiracy of sabotage. In order to completely smash the modern revisionist chicanery and blockade, under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers of this factory held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, worked hard, relied on their own efforts, and in a relatively short period of time, built equipment themselves and used their own equipment to manufacture the miniature bearings needed by the country. Shen Hanwen, a "Five-Good Worker" who contributed to this struggle, stood in the welcoming ranks and excitedly told reporters: "In the process of manufacturing miniature bearings, we encountered all kinds of difficulties. However, we were not intimidated by the difficulties. The heroic spirit of the Albanian people's proletarian backbone in the struggle against modern revisionism gave us great encouragement and strengthened our confidence and strength to overcome difficulties, enabling us to finally achieve victory." Shen Hanwen also said: "Modern revisionism dreams of strangling the throats of the Chinese and Albanian people, but they have shamefully failed. An even greater and more thorough failure awaits them!"
    Like the people of the whole country, the people of Shanghai have always regarded the Albanian people as a model to learn from in socialist revolution and socialist construction, encouraging and supporting each other. Two years ago, the Shanghai Cigarette Factory launched a revolutionary friendship competition with the "Dyrrah Roka" Cigarette Factory in Albania. When workers at the Shanghai Cigarette Factory used tobacco leaves from Albania to manufacture products, they were particularly careful to ensure quality; workers at the Albanian "Dyrrah Roka" Cigarette Factory often sent enthusiastic congratulatory messages during festivals, which greatly encouraged the workers at the Shanghai Cigarette Factory. Today, the workers of the Shanghai Cigarette Factory lined up early to express the warmest and most cordial welcome to the envoys of the heroic Albanian people.
    In the welcoming ranks, there were also Albanian students and interns in Shanghai, as well as Shanghai employees who had been to Albania. Lefter, an Albanian student studying at East China Textile Engineering Institute, came with his Chinese classmate Li Zuxin today to welcome his relatives. He said: "The two parties and the people of China and Albania are following the same revolutionary path. Like my Chinese classmates, I will strive to highlight politics, realize revolutionization, resolutely become successors to communism, and carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism to the end."
    When the distinguished guests' open car entered Xinhua Road, it was met by the Albanian national flag, five meters high and seven meters wide, composed of more than 4,600 colorful flowers. This was carefully woven by many workers, students, and lane residents, and each flower condensed their sincere feelings for the Albanian comrades. Thousands of girls and Young Pioneers holding colorful flowers, ears of wheat, and willow branches, surrounded the Albanian national flag composed of flowers, and the girls scattered fragrant rose petals, cheering and saluting the distinguished guests.
    In today's welcoming crowd, there were also commune members from suburban people's communes and fully armed militiamen. The militiamen held their automatic rifles tightly in their hands, their ranks were orderly, and their spirits were high, paying tribute to the Albanian comrades. The militiamen expressed a common wish: they must earnestly learn the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people of "holding a gun in one hand and a pickaxe in the other," always stand with the Albanian people, and carry the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism to the end.
    As the cars carrying Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kabo, and others slowly approached the guesthouse, workers, shop assistants, students, women, and Young Pioneers gathered here shouted in unison "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong-Enver." Countless colorful balloons soared into the sky; girls scattered baskets of petals on the distinguished guests. In front of the huge portrait of Comrade Hoxha, hundreds of young women dressed in festive costumes continuously changed the words "Welcome, welcome" and "Unity, unity" with bright red flowers and colored panels. Here, there was also a chorus composed of old mothers, who sang "Tirana-Beijing" in unison with full revolutionary passion; a thousand Young Pioneers played "Welcome Song" and beat revolutionary drums. All the songs and slogans merged into one voice, and thousands of hearts formed one heart. People cheered the great friendship and militant solidarity of the Chinese and Albanian people; cheered the heroic Albanian people for holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and advancing bravely in Europe, where imperialism is dying and revisionist ideas are rampant; cheered the Albanian people for writing a glorious and brilliant chapter in the history of the world proletarian revolution with their fighting actions.

### 恩维尔的战友们，上海欢迎您！

    恩维尔的战友们，上海欢迎您！
    具有光荣革命传统的我国最大城市上海，今天（五日）沉浸在欢乐和革命的激情中，“恩维尔—毛泽东”“毛泽东—恩维尔”的欢呼声，回响在这个东方巨港的上空。从四面八方汇聚到街头的六十多万群众，怀着深厚的无产阶级国际主义情谊，迎接高举马克思列宁主义革命大旗、站在反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义斗争前列的英雄人民的使者——以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团。
    正在革命化大道上阔步前进的上海人民，对在反帝反修斗争中坚贞不屈的阿尔巴尼亚人民，怀着亲切和敬佩的感情，象迎候亲人似的迎接恩维尔的战友光临。今天，人们高唱着革命歌曲走上街头，欢呼声、口号声伴随着雄壮的号声和鼓声，使得这个有着光荣革命传统的城市喜气盈盈，一片欢腾。前来欢迎的人怀着这样一种共同的强烈的感情：这不是欢迎寻常的友人，而是迎接最亲密的战友；这不是一次寻常的欢迎，而是表达自己誓同阿尔巴尼亚人民并肩斗争，把反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底的示威行动。
    今天的上海，显得分外美丽。许多高大建筑物上挂着十几层楼高的巨幅标语，在通街大道上矗立着一座座牌楼。沿途两旁楼房的阳台上，也传来热情的歌声，千万个窗口涌出了数不尽的笑脸。一眼望不到尽头的层层跨街横幅，上面写着：“战无不胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！”“坚决反对全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义！”“坚决彻底反对现代修正主义！”
    当谢胡同志由周恩来、魏文伯同志陪同，卡博同志由邓小平、曹荻秋同志陪同，凯莱齐同志和纳赛同志由马天水同志陪同，乘坐敞篷汽车从机场驶近市区的时候，欢迎的人群沸腾起来。由六千名业余歌手组成的大合唱队，齐声高唱《山鹰之歌》。由一千多人组成的腰鼓队，象欢迎战友归来一样发出了激越的鼓声。随着有节奏的鼓点，舞蹈队翩翩起舞。贵宾们向欢迎的人们频频招手，人群中一再爆发出雷动的欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“中阿友谊万岁！”
    在欢迎行列中的上海工人队伍，高举着红旗，挥舞着花束，向敢于斗争、敢于胜利的英雄人民的使者致最亲切的问候。在工人队伍里，许多人的胸前挂着金光闪闪的五好工人奖章。不少工人是刚刚下班就扛起红旗赶来的。贵宾们的敞篷汽车来到了淮海中路。聚集在这里的工人们敲起锣，擂起鼓，高唱着《地拉那—北京》的歌曲。大庆式企业——上海微型轴承厂的工人队伍也在这里，这个工厂是上海工人阶级粉碎现代修正主义破坏阴谋的胜利斗争的缩影。为了彻底粉碎现代修正主义的刁难、封锁，这个厂的工人在党组织的领导下，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，奋发图强，自力更生，在比较短的时间内，自己动手造出了设备，又用自己的设备造出了国家所需要的微型轴承。在这场斗争中作出贡献的五好工人沈汉文，站在欢迎行列里兴奋地告诉记者说：“在制造微型轴承的过程中，我们遇到了种种困难。但是，我们没有被困难吓倒。阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对现代修正主义斗争中表现出来的无产阶级硬骨头的英雄气概，给了我们很大鼓舞，增强了我们克服困难的信心和力量，使我们终于夺得了胜利。”沈汉文还说：“现代修正主义梦想卡住中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民的喉咙，但是，他们可耻地失败了。更大更彻底的失败，还在等待着他们！”
    上海人民跟全国人民一样，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，一向把阿尔巴尼亚人民作为学习的榜样，彼此相互鼓励、相互支持。两年前，上海卷烟厂就和阿尔巴尼亚的“德拉特·罗卡”卷烟厂开展了革命的友谊竞赛。上海卷烟厂工人用来自阿尔巴尼亚的烟叶制造产品时，都特别认真，保证质量；阿尔巴尼亚“德拉特·罗卡”卷烟厂工人常常在节日发来热情洋溢的贺电，使上海卷烟厂工人受到很大鼓舞。今天，上海卷烟厂的工人们很早就列队赶来，向阿尔巴尼亚英雄人民的使者表示最热烈最亲切的欢迎。
    在欢迎的行列中，还有在上海的阿尔巴尼亚留学生和实习生，也有曾经到过阿尔巴尼亚的上海职工。在华东纺织工学院学习的阿尔巴尼亚留学生莱夫台尔，今天和他的中国同学李祖馨一起来欢迎自己的亲人。他说：“阿中两党、两国人民走着同一条坚持革命的道路。我和中国同学一样要努力突出政治，实现革命化，坚决做共产主义接班人，把反帝反修斗争进行到底。”
    贵宾们乘坐的敞篷汽车进入新华路的时候，迎面矗立着用四千六百多朵彩花组成的有五米高、七米宽的阿尔巴尼亚国旗，这是许多工人、学生和里弄居民精心编扎起来的，朵朵彩花凝聚着他们对阿尔巴尼亚同志真挚的感情。上千名手持彩花、麦穗、柳条的姑娘和少先队员，簇拥着这幅用花朵组成的阿尔巴尼亚国旗，姑娘们撒出芬香的玫瑰花瓣，向贵宾们欢呼致敬。
    在今天的欢迎人群中，还有郊区人民公社的社员和全副武装的民兵。民兵们紧握手中的自动步枪，行列严整，精神抖擞，向阿尔巴尼亚战友们致敬。民兵们表示了一个共同的心愿：一定要认真学习阿尔巴尼亚人民“一手拿枪，一手拿镐”的革命精神，永远和阿尔巴尼亚人民站在一起，把反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    谢胡同志、卡博同志等乘坐的汽车徐徐驶近宾馆的时候，聚集在这里的工人、店员、学生、妇女、少先队员们齐声高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”，“毛泽东—恩维尔”。无数个彩色气球腾空飞起；姑娘们把一篮篮花瓣撒向贵宾。在霍查同志的巨幅画象前，数百个身着节日服装的女青年，用鲜艳的大红花朵和彩色版，不断地变化出“欢迎，欢迎”、“团结，团结”字样。在这里，还有一个老妈妈组成的合唱队，她们以饱满的革命激情，齐声歌唱《地拉那—北京》；一千名少先队员奏起了《欢迎曲》，敲起了革命的战鼓。所有的歌声和口号声，汇成一个声音，千万颗心结成了一条心，人们欢呼中阿两国人民的伟大友谊和战斗团结；欢呼英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在帝国主义垂死挣扎和修正主义思潮泛滥的欧洲，高举马列主义大旗，奋勇前进；欢呼阿尔巴尼亚人民以自己的战斗行动，在世界无产阶级革命史上写下光辉灿烂的篇章。　新华社驻上海记者（附图片）
