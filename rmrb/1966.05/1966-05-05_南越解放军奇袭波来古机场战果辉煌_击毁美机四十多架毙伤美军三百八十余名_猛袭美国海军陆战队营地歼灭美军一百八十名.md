    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 2nd. According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Gia Lai Province Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam once again launched a surprise attack on the US military airport in Pleiku on the night of April 21st. According to initial reports, more than 40 US aircraft were destroyed, and more than 380 enemy troops were killed or wounded, almost all of whom were US aggressor troops. In addition, many enemy vehicles at the airport were destroyed, and an enemy military stronghold and ten bunkers were blown up.
    In this surprise attack, the Liberation Armed Forces divided their forces into multiple routes and cooperated closely. When the Liberation Armed Forces' mortar shells rained down accurately and fiercely on the aircraft clusters at the airport, causing a large number of aircraft to catch fire and burn, the Liberation Armed Forces simultaneously and rapidly rushed into the airport and fiercely attacked the enemy's strongholds and bunkers, completely paralyzing the enemy's resistance.
    After suffering this surprise attack, the enemy was very panicked. It was not until the morning of April 24th that they dared to send helicopters to transport US troops to the area around the airport for searching. However, as soon as these US troops got off the helicopters, they were ambushed by the Liberation Armed Forces. Some aircraft were shot down on the spot, and a number of US aggressor troops were killed or wounded.
    This is the second major victory for the Gia Lai Province Liberation Armed Forces in attacking the Pleiku US military airport. In the first attack on February 7th of last year, the Liberation Armed Forces destroyed a total of 42 US aircraft and annihilated 357 US aggressor troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi. According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam Province, South Vietnam, launched a fierce attack on the US Marine Corps camp in Phu Thu village, Dien Quang commune, Dien Ban district, on the night of April 16th. According to preliminary reports, a total of 180 US aggressors were annihilated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 1st. According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Ngai Province, South Vietnam, once again annihilated more than 360 enemy troops in the anti-"sweeping" battles in the western area of Son Tinh district on April 21st, including 184 US aggressor troops.
    The report said that after the US aggressors and their lackeys suffered repeated defeats in the Son Tinh area, on April 21st they risked sending five battalions of US and puppet troops to "sweep" the western area of Son Tinh district. The local soldiers and civilians immediately fought back valiantly. The Liberation Army soldiers intercepted the enemy's attack, killing and wounding more than 100 enemy troops.
    Just as the puppet troops were suffering a major defeat, the American bandits sent helicopters to airdrop two battalions of US Marines to the Ngo Khe area not far from the puppet troops and north of Hill 97. These US aggressor troops were fiercely attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces shortly after landing, and 184 American devils were killed on the spot.

    南越解放军奇袭波来古机场战果辉煌
    击毁美机四十多架毙伤美军三百八十余名
    猛袭美国海军陆战队营地歼灭美军一百八十名
    新华社河内二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉莱省解放武装力量在四月二十一日夜间再次奇袭波来古美军机场。据初步消息，共击毁美国飞机四十多架，打死、打伤敌军三百八十多名，其中几乎全部是美国侵略军。此外，敌人机场上的许多机动车辆也被击毁，敌人一个军事据点和十个地堡被炸毁。
    解放武装力量在这次奇袭中，分兵多路，密切配合。当解放武装力量的迫击炮弹象雨点一样又猛又准地落在机场上的机群中，使大批飞机着火燃烧的时候，解放武装力量同时迅速冲入机场猛烈地攻击了敌人的据点和地堡，使敌人的抵抗完全陷于瘫痪。
    敌人在遭到这次突然袭击后，非常惊慌，直到四月二十四日上午，才敢出动直升飞机把美军运送到机场周围地区进行搜索，但这批美军刚从直升飞机上下来，就又遭到解放武装力量的截击，当场被击落一些飞机，打死打伤一批美国侵略军。
    这是嘉莱省解放武装力量第二次袭击波来古美军机场的大捷。在去年二月七日的第一次袭击中，解放武装力量共击毁美国飞机四十二架，歼灭美国侵略军三百五十七名。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省解放武装力量四月十六日夜晚向奠盘县奠光乡丰黍村的美国海军陆战队营地发起猛烈袭击。据初步消息，共歼灭美国侵略者一百八十名。
    据新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广义省解放武装力量，四月二十一日在山晶县西部地区的反“扫荡”战斗中，再次歼敌三百六十多名，其中有美国侵略军一百八十四名。
    报道说，美国侵略者及其走狗在山晶地区连遭失败后，四月二十一日又冒险出动五营美、伪军，到山晶县西部地区
  “扫荡”。当地军民立即英勇反击，解放军战士们截住了敌人的进攻，打死打伤一百多名敌人。
    正当伪军在大吃败仗的时候，美国强盗又出动直升飞机将两营美国海军陆战队空投到离伪军不远的鹅吉地区和九十七号高地北面。这些美国侵略军刚刚着陆不久，就遭到解放武装力量的猛烈袭击，一百八十四名美国鬼子当场被打死。
