    Jinan Military Region, a Certain Artillery Regiment Party Committee's Experience in Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Writings
    Grasp Firmly the Fundamental Issue of Worldview Transformation
    Resolutely Carry Out the Ideological Struggle of Promoting the Proletariat and Eliminating Capitalism
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan) How can leading cadres use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective world, devote their lives to revolution, and transform their thinking throughout their lives? The experience of the Party Committee members of a certain artillery regiment of the People's Liberation Army is: It is necessary to have a spirit of self-revolution, advocate the philosophy of struggle, learn in struggle, transform in struggle, and the more resolute the ideological struggle, the more the position of Mao Zedong Thought will be expanded and consolidated.
    The artillery regiment of a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region is an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's writings. In recent years, all aspects of the regiment's work have been done quite well. The members of the regiment's Party Committee have gradually realized the importance of the ideological revolutionization of leading cadres in the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings, and have persistently placed ideological transformation first in transforming their thinking and improving their work. In the ideological transformation, they correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, dare to open their minds, dare to have ideological clashes, dare to uphold the truth and correct mistakes, and also sincerely and patiently help each other. How was their fighting spirit in ideological revolution formed? What experiences do they have?
    Transformation is Struggle
    They said: First of all, there must be a common understanding - transformation is struggle.
    The members of the regiment's Party Committee realized from practice that the communist worldview is not spontaneously generated, but is formed in the ideological struggle of promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism. Transformation is struggle. No criticism, no progress; no struggle, no awakening. Criticism and self-criticism is an important aspect of studying Mao Zedong Thought in connection with reality. We must consciously use this weapon, dare to open up, dare to fight, dare to help.
    Their understanding of this issue went through a process of going from fear to fearlessness, from unconsciousness to consciousness.
    Before 1963, ideological struggle among the members of the Party Committee was not carried out sufficiently. Most comrades did not dare to open up about their own problems, and did not dare to criticize others' problems. The source of the two "dares not" was a "fear" - fear of "losing face", fear of "affecting unity". Regiment Commander Wang Buying had this concern when he first came to the regiment. Political Commissar Ma Delu was also in a state of contradiction: on the one hand, he wanted to put the problems on the table, on the other hand, he was afraid of putting the problems on the table.
    In a political movement, ideological clashes occurred at the Party Committee meeting, and everyone tasted the sweetness of ideological struggle. Then, they studied "On Contradiction", and Chairman Mao's exposition on the law of unity of opposites opened their minds. They realized that ideological contradictions are universal, and ideological struggle is inevitable; they realized that only through struggle can there be progress. Political Commissar Ma Delu said: "Since then, our understanding has taken a leap, and our minds have broadened." Deputy Political Commissar Yang Lirong originally had some status concepts. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, he basically resolved them and was determined to put down his burden and move forward lightly. But how to put it down? Is it a thorough release, or not thorough? Is it a public release, or a secret release? A secret release, the ideological foundation is not strong, and it is not good for thorough transformation; a public release, and he is afraid of pain. After struggling for a long time, he realized that to make revolution, to transform himself, he must break with wrong ideas. He revealed his "bottom line" and received everyone's help. With the desire for self-revolution and the ideological foundation of not being afraid of ugliness and daring to open up, criticism and self-criticism have been carried out relatively normally. Since then, whenever the regiment's Party Committee encounters major problems in personal ideology and style, problems in the relationship between committee members, problems in the understanding of principles and policies, etc., they can be put on the table, and an appropriate form has been found: combining the study of Chairman Mao's writings with Party life, so that study and criticism and self-criticism are combined together.
    In the second half of 1964, after studying "On Contradiction" again and the five conditions for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, they became even more conscious. They were not only not afraid of criticism and self-criticism, but also actively asked others to criticize them. Once, the division sent a work team to a company that had a well-run canteen to summarize some experience. Political Commissar Ma Delu felt that the Ninth Company was a Five-Good Canteen, so he recommended it to them. A few days later, the work team returned and said that the Ninth Company's canteen was not doing well now. This incident triggered a series of self-criticisms in him. At first, he realized that he was looking at the Ninth Company based on old impressions and that there was bureaucracy; later he thought: he had been to the Ninth Company not long ago, why didn't he discover it? This was because he ate alone in the company headquarters and did not eat with the soldiers. In the past, although he knew that this was not very appropriate, he felt that the problem was not big. At this time, comparing himself to the five conditions for revolutionary successors, he felt: not living with the soldiers, if this continues, he will become detached from the masses and his feelings will become estranged from the soldiers. This is not a trivial matter in life, but a major issue related to ideological revolutionization. At several meetings, he made serious self-examinations and asked for everyone's help. Since last year, he and the standing committee members, in conjunction with the study of Chairman Mao's writings, have held several "Old Problem Finding Meetings", finding old problems in their own ideological cultivation and thinking methods, both by themselves and by each other. They also held "Suggestion Meetings" to burn themselves and listen to the criticisms of their work from office cadres. They actively participated in branch life, accepted the supervision of the Party, and at group meetings, took the lead in opening up their thoughts and conducting self-criticism. When they gave reports to the office cadres, they also connected it with their own thoughts, educating themselves and everyone else. In study meetings, there are often fierce debates, and everyone is not afraid of being an opposition, daring to put forward their own views. Whoever has the truth is listened to, and if there is no truth, it will not pass.
    Through practice, they deeply realized that: covering up contradictions and avoiding struggle, small problems may become big problems; facing contradictions squarely and fighting against wrong things, bad things will turn into good things. Struggle is the intermediate link between learning and applying. Struggle is not a bitter thing, but a happy thing. There can be development only with struggle, progress only with struggle, and personal happiness only with struggle. They said: "Contradiction - struggle - development is the law of the development of things; problem - criticism - progress is the law of ideological transformation."
    Carry out criticism for the revolution
    Secondly, there must be a common attitude - to carry out criticism for the revolution.
    In their study and practice, they realized that to correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism, there must be a common attitude, that is: to carry out criticism for the revolution. They found that in the attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, the word "I" often jumped out to fight. When criticism is not carried out, this "I" is mainly expressed as "fear"; when criticism is carried out, it is mainly expressed as "hardness". Later, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's exposition on criticism and self-criticism, and a passage in "Serve the People" educated them deeply. "Because we serve the people, we are not afraid of others criticizing us if we have shortcomings." They realized that criticism and accepting criticism are not personal matters, but revolutionary matters, Party matters. They said: As soon as you think that criticism is for doing a good job in revolutionary work, you can be sincere and say whatever you have, without any concerns. Zhao Fengshan, the director of the political department, dared to criticize when he worked in the battalion in the past, but later ran into a few snags, and his thoughts became apprehensive. When criticizing others, it was as if there was a "transformer" in his throat. There were many opinions in his stomach, but not much came out of his voice. After studying "Serve the People" several times, he realized that when he was criticizing others, he was still mixed with personal gains and losses; fearing to criticize others, he was actually afraid of others criticizing himself. Since then, he has dared to criticize others and has been brave enough to criticize himself.
    Regiment Commander Wang Buying was not very humble in accepting criticism in the past. In the winter of 1964, according to the decision of the regiment's Party Committee, he squatted at the Second Company, rolled and tumbled with the soldiers for more than a month, improved the quality of training, summed up experience, and was valued by the superiors. At the end of the year, the division held an on-site meeting in their regiment. When Wang Buying introduced the situation, he unconsciously talked less about the role of the Party Committee and more about his own role, revealing some complacency. Political Commissar Ma Delu discovered this tendency and felt that it would be detrimental to the revolution if he did not point it out to him, so he talked to Wang Buying. When Wang Buying heard the criticism, he couldn't accept it at first, feeling that the political commissar was making a mountain out of a molehill, and his emotions became agitated and he couldn't listen to the political commissar's words. Afterwards, he studied Chairman Mao's writings, calmed down, and found that he had selfishness in his attitude towards criticism. During the three-day Spring Festival holiday, he repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant expositions, found many manifestations of his pride and complacency, and felt that the problems raised by the political commissar were completely correct. At this time, he did not think that he was "nitpicking", but was sincerely grateful. He took the initiative to confess to the political commissar, and later made an examination at the Standing Committee meeting. After criticism and heart-to-heart talks, his relationship with the political commissar did not become estranged, but became even closer. He wrote the following experience in his diary: "Fearing criticism can only lead to distress; humbly accepting criticism, what is lost is only the dirty things of individualism, and what is gained is ideological progress, comradeship and work achievements." Later, at a meeting, they formally proposed: "To accept criticism for the revolution, to self-criticize for the revolution, to criticize others for the revolution." At this time, he realized the rich ideological content contained in the formula "unity - criticism - unity".
    The combination of struggle and help
    Third, to handle a relationship well - the relationship between struggle and help.
    It is easy for ideological struggle to go astray if there is only the courage to open up ideas, dare to have ideological clashes, and dare to uphold the truth and correct mistakes, but there is no sincere and patient help from comrades. Their experience is: the combination of struggle and help must be very good. We must dare to criticize and be full of enthusiasm; we must help enthusiastically and wait patiently; it is help, not pressure; it is enlightenment, not coercion. The regiment's Party Committee correctly handled the relationship between struggle and help, treating each other with sincerity, starting from principles, starting from work, starting from unity, and conducting ideological mutual assistance with enthusiasm and patience, thus powerfully promoting the development of ideological struggle. Deputy Political Commissar Yang Lirong said: "One of the reasons why I dared to open my thoughts and put down my burden is because I saw that everyone was helping sincerely."
    From their personal experience, the regiment's Party Committee deeply realized that to study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a lively way, and to put great effort into the word "application", it is necessary to put great effort into having a spirit of struggle, a spirit of self-revolution, and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only in this way can we continuously improve our class consciousness, strengthen our Party spirit training, and realize ideological revolutionization; can we continuously expose the shortcomings and errors in our work and do our revolutionary work better; can we continuously enhance the unity of the Party Committee and strengthen collective leadership. Only in this way can we work until we are old, learn until we are old, and transform until we are old.

    济南部队某炮兵团党委活学活用毛主席著作的体会
    抓紧改造世界观这个根本问题
    坚决进行兴无灭资的思想斗争
    新华社济南电　领导干部如何用毛泽东思想改造主观世界，干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想？中国人民解放军某部炮兵团党委成员的体会是：要有自我革命精神，提倡斗争哲学，在斗争中学习，在斗争中改造，思想斗争越坚决，毛泽东思想的阵地就越扩大越巩固。
    济南部队某部炮兵团是学习毛主席著作的先进单位，几年来全团各项工作都做得比较出色。这个团党委的成员，在活学活用毛主席著作中逐步认识到领导干部思想革命化的重要，在改造思想和改进工作中，坚持不懈地把改造思想摆在首位。在思想改造中，又正确开展批评与自我批评，敢于敞开思想，敢于思想交锋，敢于坚持真理、修正错误，并且做到了相互间诚恳耐心地帮助。他们在思想革命中的斗争精神是怎样形成的？又有些什么经验？		改造就是斗争
    他们说：首先要有个共同的认识——改造就是斗争。
    这个团党委成员从实践中认识到：共产主义世界观不是自发产生的，是在兴无灭资的思想斗争中形成的。改造就是斗争。不批评，不进步；不斗争，不觉悟。批评与自我批评是学习毛泽东思想联系实际的重要方面，就要自觉运用这个武器，敢于敞，敢于斗，敢于帮。
    对这个问题的认识，他们是经过了一个由怕到不怕，由不自觉到自觉的过程。
    一九六三年以前，这个党委的成员之间思想斗争是不够开展的，多数同志对自己的问题不敢敞，对别人的问题不敢?。两个不敢，来源是一个“怕”字，怕“丢面子”，怕“影响团结”。团长王步英刚来这个团时，就存有这个顾虑。政委马德录也处于一种矛盾状态：又想把问题摆到桌面上来，又怕把问题摆到桌面上来。
    在一次政治运动中，党委会上思想交了锋，大家尝到了思想斗争的甜头。接着，他们学习了《矛盾论》，毛主席关于对立统一规律的论述，打开了他们的心窍。他们认识到，思想矛盾是普遍存在的，思想斗争是不可避免的；认识到只有斗争，才能进步。政委马德录说：“从此，我们的认识有了一个飞跃，心胸开阔了。”副政委杨立荣原来有些地位观念，经过学习毛主席著作基本上解决了，决心放下包袱，轻装前进。但怎么放？是彻底放，还是不彻底放？是公开放，还是偷偷地放？偷偷放，思想基础不牢，对彻底改造没有好处；公开放，又怕疼。斗争了好久，他认识到，要革命，要改造自己，就要和错误思想决裂。他把“底”亮了出来，得到了大家的帮助。有了自我革命的愿望和不怕丑、敢于敞的思想基础，批评和自我批评，就比较正常地开展起来了。以后，这个团党委遇到个人思想作风上的主要问题，委员之间的关系问题，对方针政策的认识问题等等，都能摆到桌面上来，并且找到了一种适当的形式：学习毛主席著作和党的生活相结合，使学习和批评与自我批评结合到一起。
    一九六四年下半年，他们再次学习《矛盾论》和培养无产阶级革命事业接班人五个条件后，就更加自觉了。不仅不怕批评、自我批评，而且主动地要求别人批评。有一次，师里派来工作组要到一个食堂办得好的连队去总结一些经验，政委马德录感到九连是五好食堂，就向他们推荐了。几天以后，工作组回来说，九连食堂现在办得并不好。这件事，引起了他一连串的自我批评。开始他认识到自己是凭老印象看九连，存在着官僚主义；后来又想：不久前到九连去过，为什么没有发现？这是因为自己在连部单独吃饭，没有和战士一起吃。过去他虽然知道这样做不大合适，但觉得问题不大。这时，他对照了革命接班人的五个条件，感到：不和战士生活在一起，长此下去，就要脱离群众，就会和战士感情疏远，这不是生活小事，而是关系到思想革命化的大问题。在几次会议上，他都严肃地进行了检查，要求大家帮助。去年以来，他和常委们结合学习毛主席著作，开过几次“找老毛病会”，自己找，互相找，找各人意识修养、思想方法上的老毛病。他们还召开“提意见会”引火烧身，听取机关干部对他们的批评。他们积极参加支部生活，接受党的监督，在小组会上，带头敞自己的思想，进行自我批评。他们在给机关干部作报告时，也联系自己的思想，既教育自己，又教育大家。他们在学习会上，常常发生激烈的争论，大家都不怕当对立面，敢于拿出自己的观点，谁有真理就听谁的，没有真理就通不过。
    通过实践，他们深深体会到：掩盖矛盾，回避斗争，小问题就可能变成大问题；正视矛盾，向错误的东西作斗争，坏事就会变成好事。斗，是学和用的中间环节。斗，不是苦事，而是乐事。有斗争才能有发展，有斗争才能有进步，有斗争才能有个人的心情舒畅。他们说：“矛盾——斗争——发展，是事物发展的规律；问题——批评——前进，是思想改造的规律。”		为革命而开展批评
    其次，要有一个共同的态度——为革命而开展批评。
    他们在学习实践中体会到，正确地开展批评和自我批评，要有一个共同的态度，这就是：为革命而开展批评。他们发现，在对待批评和自我批评的态度上，常常有一个“我”字跳出来打架。当批评不开展时，这个“我”主要表现是“怕”；当批评开展起来之后，又主要表现是“硬”。后来他们反复学习毛主席关于批评和自我批评的论述，《为人民服务》中的一段话，对他们教育很深。“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”他们认识到，批评和接受批评，不是个人的事情，而是革命的事情，党的事情。他们说：一想到批评是为了搞好革命工作，就能推心置腹，有啥说啥，没啥顾虑了。政治处主任赵凤山，过去在营里工作时，也敢于批评，后来碰了几个钉子，思想上便产生了顾虑。一批评别人，就好象嗓子眼有个“变压器”，肚子里的意见很多，一到嗓门就没有多少了，几次学习《为人民服务》以后，他觉察到，原来自己在批评别人的时候，还夹杂着个人的患得患失的思想；怕批评别人，实际上是怕别人批评自己。从此，他既敢批评别人，又勇于批评自己了。
    团长王步英过去接受批评不大虚心。一九六四年冬，他根据团党委的决定，到二连蹲点，和战士一起摸爬滚打了一个多月，提高了训练质量，总结出经验，受到了上级的重视。年底，师里在他们团召开现场会，王步英介绍情况时，不自觉地谈党委的作用少，说自己的作用多，流露出一些自满情绪。政委马德录发现了这个苗头，觉得不向他指出对革命不利，便找王步英谈心。王步英听到批评，开始接受不了，感到政委把芝麻大的事情说得那么严重，感情就冲动起来，政委的话听不进去了。事后，他学习了毛主席著作，便冷静下来，发现自己对待批评有私心。在春节三天假期内，他又反复学习了毛主席的有关论述，找出了自己骄傲自满的许多表现，感到政委提出的问题完全是正确的，这时就不觉得他是“吹毛求疵”，而是由衷地感激了。他主动找政委交了心，以后又在常委会上作了检查。经过批评和谈心，他和政委的感情不是疏远了，而是更加亲密了。他在日记中写下这样一段体会：“害怕批评，只能得到苦恼；虚心地接受批评，失掉的只是个人主义的脏东西，得到的却是思想上的进步，同志的友谊和工作上的成绩。”后来在一次会议上，他们正式提出：“要为革命而接受批评，为革命而自我批评，为革命而批评别人。”这时候，他才知道“团结——批评——团结”这个公式所包含的丰富的思想内容。		斗和帮相结合
    第三、要处理好一个关系——斗和帮的关系。
    光有敢于敞开思想、敢于思想交锋、敢于坚持真理、修正错误，没有同志间互相诚恳而耐心的帮助，思想斗争还容易发生偏差。他们的体会是：斗和帮要很好结合。既要敢于批评，又要满腔热情；既要热情帮助，又要耐心等待；是帮，不是压；是启发，不是强迫。团党委正确处理了斗和帮的关系，互相间赤诚相见，从原则出发，从工作出发，从团结出发，热情耐心地进行思想互助，因而有力地促进了思想斗争的开展。副政委杨立荣说：“我所以敢于敞思想，放包袱，原因之一，就是看到大家都是诚意的帮助。”
    这个团党委从切身体会中，深刻地认识到，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，就要狠在有斗争精神，有自我革命的精神，正确开展批评和自我批评。只有这样，才能不断提高阶级觉悟，加强党性锻炼，实现思想革命化；才能不断揭露工作中的缺点和错误，把革命工作做得更好；才能不断地增强党委团结，加强集体领导。只有这样，才能干到老、学到老、改造到老。
