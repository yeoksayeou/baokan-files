    The Relationship Between the Party and the Masses Cannot Be Sown Discord by Anyone
    I myself have personally experienced that the Party truly represents the interests of the working people and is the most loving and caring of the working people. Deng Tuo's attempts to sow discord between the Party and the masses are futile.
    Yi Shijuan, Representative of the National People's Congress, National Advanced Producer of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2
    Deng Tuo attacks our great Party for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." This is an extremely vicious slander!
    Historically, all emperors, generals, and reactionary rulers cruelly oppressed and exploited the working people, never giving any thought to the masses. In the old society, workers were suffocated by the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, living lives worse than cattle and horses year after year. It was the Party that led us in a long and arduous struggle against the enemy to liberate us from our miserable lives. In this struggle, countless good sons and daughters of the Party shed their blood and sacrificed their lives for the people. Gu Zhenghong, a martyr from our factory, was killed by the enemy in the struggle.
    After liberation, the working class took over the country and became the masters of the state. Take myself, for example. In the old society, I was an ordinary female worker. Since 1954, I have been elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, and I have sat with the beloved Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders several times in Beijing to discuss the important affairs of the people, the important affairs of the country, and the important affairs of the world. Looking at our factory, the leading cadres of our factory were also unanimously elected by us workers, and the factory's employees have grown rapidly one by one under the education and training of the Party. Half of the cadres at all levels in the factory have been promoted from among the workers. Major events in the factory are discussed and decided at the workers' representative assembly, and the working class has full voice. Based on our own personal experience, we deeply realize that the Party truly represents the interests of us working people, is the most loving and caring of us working people, and is the most trusting and relying on the masses. Without the Party, we working people would have nothing.
    Deng Tuo is trying every possible means to sow discord in our flesh-and-blood relationship with the Party. This is a futile attempt. He is using the name of the "masses" to vent his deep hatred of the Party. Deng Tuo does not want leading cadres to listen to the opinions of the broad masses but wants the Party to accept the "schemes" of a small group of them to engage in capitalist restoration. Everyone, see what a vicious conspiracy this is! We warn Deng Tuo: We will never be fooled by you. No matter what means you use, we the working class will resolutely stand with the Party and tear off your masks. Thoroughly smash your "Three-Family Village"!

    党和群众的关系是谁也挑拨不了的
    我自己亲身体会到，党是真正代表劳动人民利益的，是最爱护和关心劳动人民的。邓拓挑拨党群关系，是枉费心机
    全国人民代表大会代表上海国棉二厂全国先进生产者  裔式娟
    邓拓攻击我们伟大的党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，这是极其恶毒的诬蔑！
    在历史上，一切帝王将相和反动统治者，都是残酷地压迫和剥削劳动人民的，从来不把群众放在眼里。在旧社会，工人被帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山压得透不过气来，成年累月过着牛马不如的生活。是党，为了把我们从水深火热的生活中解救出来，领导我们与敌人展开了长期艰苦的斗争。在这一斗争中，无数党的好儿女抛头颅，洒热血，为人民献出了自己的生命。我们厂的顾正红烈士，就是在斗争中被敌人杀害的。
    解放后，工人阶级坐了江山，做了国家的主人。拿我自己来说，我在旧社会里，是一个普通女工，从一九五四年起就当选为全国人民代表大会的代表，几次上北京同敬爱的毛主席以及党和国家的其他领导人坐在一起，共同讨论人民的大事，国家的大事，世界的大事。再看看我们工厂吧，我们厂的领导干部，也都是我们工人一致推选出来的，厂内职工在党的教导和培养下，一个个迅速成长起来。在全厂各级干部中，有半数是从工人中提拔的。厂内的大事都要在职工代表大会上讨论决定，工人阶级有了充分的发言权。我们根据自己的亲身经历，深深体会到党是真正代表我们劳动人民的利益的，是最最爱护和关心我们劳动人民的，也是最最相信群众、依靠群众的。没有党，就没有我们劳动人民的一切。
    邓拓千方百计挑拨我们和党的血肉关系，这是枉费心机。他是冒充“群众”之名，来发泄他对党的刻骨仇恨。邓拓根本不是要领导干部倾听广大群众的意见，而是要党接受他们一小撮人搞资本主义复辟的“计谋”。大家看，这是一个多么恶毒的阴谋！我们警告邓拓：我们决不会上你们的当。不管你们施展什么手段，我们工人阶级坚决和党站在一起，撕下你们的画皮。彻底捣毁你们的“三家村”！
