    This newspaper provides comprehensive coverage according to Xinhua News Agency reports: Journalists from Asian countries have gathered in meetings in recent days, and newspapers have published commentaries to celebrate Asian-African Journalists' Day and congratulate the great achievements of the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association held in Beijing.
    Vietnamese journalists held a gathering on the evening of April 29th. Hoang Van Dient, Vice Chairman of the Vietnamese Journalists Association, introduced the significance of the establishment of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and its activities over the past three years. He strongly condemned the crimes of the pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia in persecuting Indonesian journalists and blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of the Asian-African Journalists' Association. He also expressed a warm welcome to the positive results achieved at the recent Secretariat Meeting of the Asian-African Journalists' Association held in Beijing, and thanked the meeting for its full support of the Vietnamese people's just struggle to resist America and save the nation.
    Pakistani journalists, in response to the call of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, held gatherings in Rawalpindi and Karachi on the 24th to warmly celebrate "Asian-African Journalists' Day."
    Asrar Ahmed, Chairman of the Pakistan Federation of Journalists, spoke at the gathering in Rawalpindi, congratulating the remarkable achievements of the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association held in Beijing. He hoped that the meeting would achieve the desired unity.
    Referring to the relocation of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association from Jakarta, he said that the Secretariat had to move out of Jakarta, but the work of the Asian-African Journalists' Association would continue to move forward, and no force could undermine the unity of Asian-African journalists.
    At the plenary meeting of the Karachi Journalists Association, Chairman Minhaj Barna pointed out that Asian-African journalists have played an important role in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence. He called on all Asian-African journalists to strengthen unity and uphold the Jakarta Declaration.
    Cambodian newspapers published editorials and commentaries on the 25th to congratulate the successful holding of the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association in Beijing, defeating the sabotage activities of imperialism.
    A commentary in *New Message* stated: "Everything that the Asian-African Journalists' Association has done has displeased the warmongering and insatiable capitalists. They have tried every means to discredit and undermine the lofty ideals of this association. They have bought off reactionaries in various countries who serve their interests, especially the reactionaries in Indonesia. They have instructed the reactionaries to arrest members of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, which was formerly located in Indonesia, and to accuse these members under various barbaric decrees. The imperialist lackeys in Indonesia are not satisfied with these crimes. They also use other means, such as warning the Royal Government of Cambodia, not to allow this organization to hold meetings on the territory of the independent and neutral Kingdom of Cambodia."
    The commentary concluded: "The idea of ​​struggling to overcome difficulties is bound to be unstoppable. The Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association has been successfully held. The anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist anger in the hearts of all journalists has erupted, thus clearly demonstrating to world public opinion that, no matter what, the unity of the Asian-African people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism will never be weakened."
    The *Cambodia Telegraph* pointed out in an editorial: "The sole purpose of the Asian-African Journalists meeting is to exchange opinions and find better ways to fight our common enemies at home and abroad. Our internal enemies are primarily the obstacles that hinder the faster progress of underdeveloped countries. Our external enemies are clearly the American imperialists, who are destroying national unity everywhere in the world and undermining the solidarity of the peoples of developing countries."
    Burmese newspaper *People's Daily* and Nepalese *New Society Daily* congratulated the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association recently held in Beijing.
    The Burmese *People's Daily* published an editorial on April 29th, stating: "All Asian-African journalists should respond to the call of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and, together with the Asian-African people, use their weapons to wage a resolute and courageous struggle against imperialism."
    The editorial said: "Since the right-wing forces seized power in Indonesia, the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association has had to transfer its work location to Beijing due to persecution by the Indonesian right-wing."
    The editorial introduced the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and pointed out: "The aims and tasks of the Asian-African Journalists' Association have not changed, only the political atmosphere in Indonesia has changed."
    The Nepalese newspaper *New Society Daily* published an editorial on April 30th, supporting the resolutions passed by the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association.
    The editorial stated: Indonesia is no longer a country that opposes imperialism and neo-colonialism and old colonialism. The right-wing military has gained power there. In this situation, it is not possible for the Asian-African Journalists Association to operate in Jakarta. Since the situation changed last October, the situation of Indonesian journalists has been an infuriating matter for journalists. Many nationalistic, patriotic journalists who opposed the military regime have either been killed or imprisoned. In this situation, it is necessary for the secretariat to move its offices to a place where it can operate smoothly. Chavodo said that Beijing is such a place at present, and there is no reason to object to this.
    The editorial concluded: Now it can be believed that the Asian-African Journalists Association will successfully achieve its goals.

    响应亚非记协号召　加强反帝反殖斗争
    谴责印尼右派干涉与迫害亚非记协书记处和印尼新闻工作者的罪行
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：亚洲各国新闻工作者连日来纷纷集会，报纸分别发表评论，庆祝亚非新闻工作者日，并祝贺亚非新闻工作者协会书记处在北京召开的第四次全体会议（扩大）的巨大成就。
    越南新闻工作者　四月二十九日晚上举行集会，越南新闻工作者协会副主席黄文戬在会上介绍了亚非新闻工作者协会成立的意义和三年来活动的情况。他强烈谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动势力迫害印度尼西亚新闻工作者和明目张胆地干涉亚非新闻工作者协会内部事务的罪行，并且表示热烈欢迎最近在北京举行的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处会议所取得的良好结果，感谢会议对越南人民抗美救国正义斗争的完全支持。
    巴基斯坦新闻工作者　响应亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的号召，二十四日在拉瓦尔品第和卡拉奇集会，热烈庆祝“亚非新闻工作者日”。
    巴基斯坦新闻工作者联合会主席阿斯拉尔·艾哈迈德在拉瓦尔品第的集会上讲话时，祝贺亚非新闻工作者协会书记处在北京召开的第四次全体会议
  （扩大）所取得的惊人成就。他希望会议达到所切望的团结一致。
    他在谈到亚非新闻工作者协会书记处迁离雅加达时说，协会书记处不得不迁出雅加达，但是亚非新闻工作者协会的工作将继续向前推进，没有任何力量能够破坏亚非新闻工作者的团结。
    在卡拉奇新闻工作者协会的全体会议上，协会主席明哈杰·巴尔纳指出，亚非新闻工作者在反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争中起了重要的作用。他号召全体亚非新闻工作者加强团结，维护雅加达宣言。
    柬埔寨报纸二十五日纷纷发表社论和评论，祝贺亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）在北京胜利召开，挫败了帝国主义的破坏活动。
    《新消息报》的评论说：“亚非新闻工作者协会所做的一切，使好战的和贪得无厌的资本家很不高兴。他们千方百计地诋毁和破坏这个协会的崇高理想。他们收买为他们的利益服务的各国反动派，特别是印度尼西亚的反动派。他们指使反动派逮捕曾经设在印度尼西亚的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处的成员，根据各种野蛮的法令来控告这些成员。印度尼西亚的帝国主义走狗还不满足于这些罪行。他们还使用其他的手段，如警告柬埔寨王国政府，不准这个组织在独立和中立的柬埔寨王国的领土上召开会议。”
    评论最后说：“战胜困难进行斗争的思想，必然是不可阻挡的。亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）已经胜利召开了。全体新闻工作者内心的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的怒火已经爆发了，从而向世界舆论清楚地表明，不管怎样，亚非人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争中的团结是绝对不会削弱的。”
    《柬埔寨电讯报》在社论中指出：“亚非新闻工作者开会的唯一目的，就是交换意见，找出更好的办法，来同我们内外的共同敌人作斗争。我们的内部敌人首先是阻挠不发达国家更快前进的障碍。我们的外部敌人显然就是美帝国主义者，他们在世界上到处破坏民族统一，破坏正在发展中的各国人民的团结。”
    缅甸报纸《人民报》和尼泊尔《新社会报》祝贺最近在北京举行的亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）。
    缅甸《人民报》四月二十九日发表社论说：“全体亚非新闻工作者应当响应亚非新闻工作者协会的号召，同亚非人民一道，用他们的武器对帝国主义进行坚决勇敢的斗争。”
    社论说：“自从右派势力在印度尼西亚夺取政权以后，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处由于受到印度尼西亚右派的迫害，不得不把工作地点转移到北京。”
    社论介绍了亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的决议，并且指出：“亚非新闻工作者协会的目的和任务没有改变，改变的只是印度尼西亚的政治气氛。”
    尼泊尔报纸《新社会报》四月三十日发表社论，支持亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）通过的决议。
    社论说：印度尼西亚现在已经不是一个反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的国家了，右派军人已经在那里得势。在这种情况下，亚非新闻工作者协会已经没有可能在雅加达进行活动。去年十月形势发生变化后，印度尼西亚新闻工作者的处境，是一件使新闻界人士感到愤怒的事情。许多反对军事政权的民族主义的爱国新闻工作者不是被打死就是被关起来。在这种情况下，书记处把办事处迁往一个它能够顺利进行工作的地方去是必需的。查禾多说，目前北京就是这样一个地方，对此是没有理由提出异议的。
    社论最后说：现在可以相信，亚非新闻工作者协会定将成功地达到它的目的。
