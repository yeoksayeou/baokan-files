　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st. More than a thousand foreign friends from over sixty countries and regions braved the rain today to celebrate International Labor Day with the three million people of the capital.
　　Some of these foreign friends came from the front lines of the struggle against U.S. imperialism, some stood at the forefront of the struggle against modern revisionism, and most came from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle is surging. Today, friends from the five continents celebrated the fighting festival of working people all over the world together with the people of the capital, indicating that the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the world is growing daily, and that China has friends all over the world.
　　In many parks in the capital, some foreign friends joined the masses in singing fighting songs, expressing their determination to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world against U.S. imperialism. A choir composed of experts from South Africa, Sudan, France, Britain, Austria, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries, holding a banner with the words "Workers of all countries, unite to oppose U.S. imperialism!" entered the carnival circles formed by the masses, singing songs such as "The Internationale," "Song of the Wind and Thunder," and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." Representatives of the workers from South Vietnam, at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle, were warmly welcomed everywhere. Tran Hoai Nam, Standing Committee Member of the South Vietnam Liberation Trade Union Federation, took the hand of Zhang Baifa, a national advanced producer, and said that we regard the achievements of the Chinese people as our own victory. Even if we are only fighting one U.S. imperialism now, even if there are three U.S. imperialisms, we can defeat them, because we have the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Laotian artists today sang a popular Laotian song "De Mang Nuo" to the celebrating masses with fighting passion, they sang: "The Laotian people love peace and do not want to be slaves; the Laotian people, united as one, are determined to drive out the American invaders!" At this time, the masses applauded warmly, expressing their high respect for the heroic Laotian people. Wherever the Albanian Trade Union delegation went, they were warmly surrounded by the masses, who sang the Albanian song "Partisan Eagle" together with the Albanian comrades. Ekme Kexiu, the head of this delegation, said after watching the mass performance of "Three Americans" and "Vietnamese Female Militia": "We have seen the great internationalist feelings of the Chinese people cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and we have seen the great support of the Chinese people for the struggle of the Vietnamese and the people of the world." Mejiahel Abdaerkadar, head of the Algerian General Workers' Union delegation, said after watching the entertainment program "The South Vietnamese People Annihilate the U.S. Aggressors": U.S. imperialism is being beaten everywhere now. The people and workers of Algeria and China will continue to strengthen their unity because we have common goals in our struggle.
　　N.P. Rizal, Minister of Industry and Commerce of friendly neighboring Nepal, and his wife, and the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation led by Ran Niette, Chairman of the Cambodian-Chinese Friendship Association, all participated in the mass celebrations today, and they were warmly welcomed. Rizal watched the dance in Beihai Park. After watching the "Harvest Dance," he said that this dance is very similar to the dance of the people in northern Nepal, and it is a pleasure to be able to celebrate the festival with the Chinese people and see such a dance in Beijing. Saito Tsunehachi, a 77-year-old member of the 12th Japan-China Friendship Association Visiting Group, said excitedly that he felt happy to be able to celebrate "May Day" with the Chinese people. Saito Tsunehachi participated in the celebrations in Tokyo when the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, but he never had the opportunity to come to China. His wish was fulfilled this year. He said that he hoped to visit China again in the future. I want to contribute my strength to restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China and promoting Japan-China friendship. Some foreign friends expressed their boundless love for the Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong in various ways during the celebration activities. The actors of the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," a song praising Chairman Mao Zedong, and the poem written by Chairman Mao, "Ode to the Militia Women," in Chinese. The actor Vilei Wan sang "Harvest Song" and "Returning from Target Practice" in Chinese. Every time they sang a Chinese song, it aroused warm applause from the audience. Gonte Ford, an actor from the Guinean National Zoliba Dance Troupe, played the "guitar" and led the singing of "The East is Red" and the song he composed on the way to China, "Fighting Africa Sings Praises of Mao Zedong and His Great Cause." This song praises Mao Zedong Thought as "the sun that never sets," which "illuminates the hearts of the fighting people all over the world." Gonte Ford said during the celebration: "I sing about Mao Zedong because Mao Zedong is not only working for the Chinese people, he is working for all the people oppressed by imperialism. Although I have never met Mao Zedong, when I sing about Mao Zedong, it is like standing by his side, like facing him and singing. As an artist, I also want to work for the Guinean people, for the entire African people, and for the cause of opposing imperialism and colonialism." When Gonte Ford and the actors of the song and dance troupe sang the above songs, the audience applauded thunderously, and people paid tribute to the fighting African people. Then, Kuayate Sori Kandia, the deputy director of the dance troupe, took the stage and sang "Listen to the Party" and "Ten Songs of the Border Region" in Chinese, and his passionate singing aroused cheers from the audience. At the request of the people, he also sang the Guinean song "Conakry."

    中国人民同世界人民的友谊日益发展
    来自六十多个国家和地区的千名外国朋友同首都人民欢度“五一”节许多外国朋友通过各种方式表达了对中国人民和毛主席的无限热爱
    新华社一日讯　来自六十多个国家和地区的一千多位外国朋友，今天冒雨和首都三百万人民一起欢度“五一”国际劳动节。
    这些外国朋友，有些来自反对美帝国主义斗争的前线，有些站在反对现代修正主义斗争的前列，大多数来自觉醒的反帝革命斗争风起云涌的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲。今天，五大洲的朋友和首都人民一起共庆全世界劳动人民的战斗节日，表明中国人民同全世界人民之间的友谊日益发展，表明中国的朋友遍布全世界。
    在首都的许多公园里，一些外国朋友同首都联欢的群众并肩高唱战斗歌曲，表达他们支持越南人民和全世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争的决心。由来自南非、苏丹、法国、英国、奥地利、美国、澳大利亚、新西兰等国的专家组成的合唱团，高举着写有“全世界无产者联合起来，反对美帝国主义！”的标语，走进群众结成的联欢圈里，高唱《全世界无产者联合起来》、《风雷之歌》、《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲。来自反美斗争前线的越南南方工人代表，到处受到热烈的欢迎。越南南方解放工会联合会常务委员陈怀南拉着全国先进生产者张百发的手说，我们把中国人民的成就，看成是自己的胜利。我们现在只是打一个美帝国主义，就是有三个美帝国主义，我们也可以打败，因为我们有中国和全世界人民的支持。老挝艺术家们今天满怀战斗的激情，向联欢的群众演唱了老挝一支流行的歌曲《得芒诺》，他们唱道：“老挝人民热爱和平，不愿做奴隶；老挝人民，团结一致，坚决赶走美国侵略者！”这时，群众热烈鼓掌，向英雄的老挝人民表示崇高的敬意。阿尔巴尼亚工会代表团每到一处，就被群众热情地包围起来，人们同阿尔巴尼亚同志一起唱起阿尔巴尼亚歌曲《游击队之鹰》。这个代表团的团长艾克梅克奇乌在观看了群众表演的“三个美国佬”、“越南女民兵”以后说：“我们看到了中国共产党、毛泽东主席培养出的中国人民的伟大国际主义感情，看到了中国人民对越南和全世界人民斗争的巨大支持。”阿尔及利亚工人总联合会代表团团长梅贾海尔·阿卜代尔卡达尔看了群众演出的《南越人民歼灭美国侵略者》的文娱节目以后说：美帝国主义现在到处挨打。阿尔及利亚同中国的人民和工人将不断加强团结，因为我们有着共同的斗争目标。
    来自友好邻邦的尼泊尔工商大臣纳·普·里贾尔和夫人，柬中友协主席兰·涅特率领的柬中友协代表团，今天都参加了群众联欢活动，他们都受到了热烈的欢迎。里贾尔在北海公园里观看了舞蹈。他看了“丰收舞”以后说，这个舞蹈很象尼泊尔北部人民的舞蹈，我们能够同中国人民一起欢度节日，又在北京看到这样的舞蹈，令人高兴。日中友协第十二次访华团的一位七十七岁的团员斋藤常八激动地说，他能和中国人民一起欢度“五一”，感到幸福。斋藤常八在一九四九年中华人民共和国成立时，曾在东京参加庆祝活动，但一直没有机会到中国来。他的愿望今年实现了。他说，我希望以后能再来中国访问。我要为恢复日中邦交、促进日中友好而贡献自己的力量。有些外国朋友在联欢活动中通过各种方式，表达他们对中国人民和毛泽东主席的无限热爱。老挝爱国战线党文工团的演员们用中国话演唱了歌颂毛泽东主席的《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席写的诗《为女民兵题照》。演员维莱婉用中国话独唱了《丰收歌》和《打靶归来》。他们每唱一首中国歌曲，都引起全场热烈的掌声。几内亚国立佐利巴舞蹈团的演员贡特·福德，自弹“吉他”，领唱了《东方红》和他来中国途中创作的歌曲《战斗的非洲歌颂毛泽东和他伟大的事业》。这首歌曲，歌颂毛泽东思想“是永远不落的太阳”，它“把全世界战斗的人民心儿照亮”。贡特·福德在联欢时说：“我歌唱毛泽东，是因为毛泽东不只是在为中国人民而工作，他是在为所有受帝国主义压迫的人民而工作。我虽然没有见过毛泽东，但是我在歌唱毛泽东的时候，就象站在他的身边，就象面对着他而歌唱。我作为艺术家，也要为几内亚人民，为整个非洲人民，为反对帝国主义和殖民主义的事业而工作。”贡特·福德和歌舞团演员们在演唱以上歌曲的时候，全场掌声雷动，人们向战斗的非洲人民致敬。接着，这个舞蹈团的副总团长库雅特·索里·康迪亚登台又用中国话演唱了《听话要听党的话》、《边区十唱》，他那充满激情的歌声，引起全场欢呼。在人们的要求下，他又演唱了几内亚歌曲《科纳克里》。
