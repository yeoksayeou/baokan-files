　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, in the 21 months since August 1964, when U.S. imperialism began bombing North Vietnam, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have carried out 43 attacks on 24 air bases and airports of the U.S.-puppet forces, destroying and damaging a total of 1,245 enemy aircraft and eliminating 5,361 U.S. aggressor troops.

　　From August 7 to December 15, 1964, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces carried out six attacks on U.S.-puppet air bases and airports, destroying and damaging 62 enemy aircraft and eliminating 730 U.S. aggressor troops.

　　From February 7 to December 18, 1965, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces carried out 19 attacks on U.S.-puppet air bases and airports, destroying and damaging 604 enemy aircraft and eliminating 2,374 U.S. aggressor troops.

　　From January to April 22 this year, the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces carried out 18 attacks on U.S.-puppet air bases and airports, destroying and damaging 579 enemy aircraft and eliminating 2,257 U.S. aggressor troops.

　　In the above 43 attacks, nine were directed against the U.S. strategic air bases at Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa, and Da Nang. In these nine attacks, a total of 390 enemy aircraft were destroyed and damaged, most of which were jet fighters and B-57 bombers, eliminating 2,451 U.S. aggressor troops.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - Vietnamese newspapers published editorials on the 30th, warmly hailing the glorious victories of the North Vietnamese army and people in shooting down over 1,000 U.S. bandit aircraft.

　　The editorial in the "People's Daily" pointed out that the achievement of shooting down 1,000 U.S. aircraft is a victory of people's war and a concrete manifestation of the revolutionary heroism and determination of the entire Vietnamese army and people to defeat the U.S. bandits.

　　The editorial said that after more than a year of fighting, we have clearly seen the invincible power of people's war. The achievement of shooting down 1,000 U.S. aircraft has powerfully inspired the Vietnamese army and people and dealt a blow to the U.S. bandits. Although they have suffered a crushing defeat, they are extremely stubborn. They are planning new military adventures. The Vietnamese army and people must be ready to give the U.S. bandits an even more violent blow at any time.

　　The editorial in the "People's Army Daily" pointed out that shooting down 1,000 U.S. aircraft marks the failure of the U.S. imperialists' destructive war against North Vietnam. The United States' frenzied attacks on the North cannot only save it from the disastrous defeat of its "special war" in the South, but also cannot save it from suffering even more disastrous defeat in the local war it is waging in the South.

　　The editorial said that people's war has already shown its power. Only people's war can turn every village, construction site, factory, and ferry crossing into strongholds and fortresses for resisting the U.S. bandits. Only people's war can strike the enemy in a timely and effective manner. The great achievements of people's war are eloquently proving that the decisive factors in achieving victory in war are people, fighting spirit, and justice.

　　The editorial called on the North Vietnamese army and people to hold high President Ho's banner of "determination to defeat the U.S. aggressor bandits" and completely bury the U.S. aggressor bandits.

    南越军民一年多来四十三次袭击美伪空军基地和机场
    毁伤敌机一千二百多架歼灭美军五千多名
    越《人民报》说北方军民击落美机一千多架是人民战争的辉煌胜利
    新华社河内三十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量自从一九六四年八月，即美帝国主义开始轰炸越南北方以来的二十一个月中，对美伪军的二十四个空军基地和机场，进行了四十三次袭击，共击毁击伤敌机一千二百四十五架，歼灭美国侵略军五千三百六十一名。
    从一九六四年八月七日到十二月十五日，越南南方解放武装力量对美伪空军基地和机场进行了六次袭击，击毁击伤敌机六十二架，歼灭美国侵略军七百三十名。
    从一九六五年二月七日到十二月十八日，越南南方解放武装力量对美伪空军基地和机场进行了十九次袭击。击毁击伤敌机六百零四架，歼灭美国侵略军二千三百七十四名。
    从今年一月到四月二十二日，越南南方解放武装力量对美伪空军基地和机场进行了十八次袭击，击毁击伤敌机五百七十九架，歼灭美国侵略军二千二百五十七名。
    在上述的四十三次袭击中，有九次是针对新山一、边和和岘港的美国战略空军基地的。在这九次袭击中，共击毁击伤敌机三百九十架，其中大部分是喷气式战斗机和B—57型轰炸机，歼灭美国侵略军二千四百五十一名。
    新华社河内三十日电　越南各报三十日分别发表社论，热烈欢呼越南北方军民击落美国强盗飞机一千多架的辉煌战绩。
    《人民报》的社论指出，击落美机一千架的战果，是人民战争的胜利，是越南全体军民的革命英雄主义和决心战胜美国强盗意志的具体表现。
    社论说，经过一年多的战斗，我们清楚地看到人民战争的无敌力量。击落一千架美国飞机的战功，有力地鼓舞了越南军民，打击了美国强盗。他们虽然输得很惨，但是却极端顽固。他们正在部署新的军事冒险计划。越南军民必须随时准备给予美国强盗以更加猛烈的打击。
    《人民军队报》的社论指出，击落美机一千架，标志着美帝国主义对越南北方进行的破坏性战争的失败。美国疯狂袭击北方，不仅挽救不了它在南方进行的“特种战争”的惨败，也挽救不了他在南方进行的局部战争中遭到更加惨败的命运。
    社论说，人民战争已经显示了它的威力。只有人民战争，才能把每个村庄、工地、工厂和渡口变成抗击美国强盗的据点和堡垒。只有人民战争，才能及时和有效地打击敌人。人民战争的伟大战绩，正在雄辩地证明：取得战争胜利的决定因素是人，是战斗精神和正义。
    社论号召越南北方军民更高地举起胡主席的“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的旗帜，彻底埋葬美国侵略强盗。
