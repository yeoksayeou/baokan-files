    This newspaper reports that the Meizhuang Brigade of the Niujiaqiao Commune in Longyao County, Xingtai Prefecture, which suffered a severe earthquake, has, through the struggle against the disaster, arranged for the livelihood of the masses and restored collective production. When the broad masses of commune members were answering the cordial care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the strong support of the people of the whole country with heartfelt gratitude and practical actions, they heard the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Deng Tuo and his gang, and they heard their malicious attacks on our Party's "going back on its word," "untrustworthy," and "unpopular," which filled them with extreme anger, and they severely condemned the shameless conspiracy of the traitor Deng Tuo to try to sow discord between the Party and the masses.
    The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association of the Meizhuang Brigade, according to the demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, convened a forum on the evening of May 13. Everyone used ironclad facts to angrily refute Deng Tuo's wild lies, and firmly stated that they would smash the "Three-Family Village" and thoroughly make revolution.
      The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our Great Saviors
    Wang Xiangxi, chairman of the Poor Peasants Association, said: Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black words have simply infuriated us poor and lower-middle peasants. Deng Tuo said that the Communist Party is "untrustworthy" and "unpopular," which is purely nonsense! We poor and lower-middle peasants know best who is good and who is bad. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our great saviors, our closest relatives. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no way for us poor and lower-middle peasants to survive. Deng Tuo wants to sow discord between the Party and the masses, but he will not succeed! Deng Tuo, you slander the Party and attack the Party, which completely exposes your anti-Party and anti-socialist essence, and completely exposes you as the mortal enemy of the Party and the people. You want our Party to quickly step down and "rest," and listen to your "guidance" in everything, and gain your "popularity." Let me tell you, this is wishful thinking! We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely support the Communist Party and resolutely take the bright road of socialism under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.
    Si Ronglian, a poor peasant young woman, said: We poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a high level of class consciousness and bright eyes. We can clearly distinguish between fragrant flowers, poisonous weeds, demons, and monsters. We saw through you, Deng Tuo, at a glance, a wolf in sheep's clothing. You attack the Party, sow discord between the Party and the masses, and slander the Party for "looking down on the masses," "untrustworthy," and "unpopular." These words are spewed out of the same mouth as the landlords and rich peasants in our village, and they echo Jiang Jieshi and Khrushchev. The Party led us to overthrow the "three great mountains," making the slaves of the old society the masters of the new society; the Party led us to take the road of collectivization and live a happy life. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never forget all of this for generations to come. Your gang of black thugs hates the Party and shoots poisonous arrows and spits black words at the Party, which can only expose your anti-Party and anti-socialist true colors. We must resolutely fight you to the end, completely smash your black shop, and eliminate all the ghosts and monsters. We will never stop until we win complete victory.
      Without the Party, We Would Not Have Overcome This Earthquake Disaster
    Wang Xisheng, a member of the Poor Peasants Association of the Third Production Team, said: Chairman Mao said long ago: "There is absolutely no such thing as love without cause, nor is there hatred without cause." Deng Tuo viciously attacked the Communist Party, saying "untrustworthy" and "unpopular," because under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we fought down the landlords, defeated the bullies, raided the old nest of feudalism, and also crushed the rampant attacks of capitalist forces, so that Deng Tuo and his gang of ghosts and monsters could no longer ride on the heads of us poor people and act like tyrants. We have unlimited trust and unparalleled love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, because the Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of us poor people. Not to mention the past, let's just talk about how the Party and Chairman Mao rescued us disaster victims after this earthquake occurred. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army, medical teams, and cadres at all levels to us overnight; they used airplanes to drop cooked food, transport patients, and rescue us. When the people all over the country heard that we had suffered a disaster, they transported rice, flour, medicine, bamboo poles, wood, straw curtains, reed mats, and all kinds of agricultural tools from all directions. Class brothers in Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other places even transported a large number of livestock to us. It is precisely because of the cordial care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the strong support of class brothers across the country that we people in the disaster area were able to overcome the natural disaster, quickly arrange our lives, and resume production. Who in our disaster area does not say "Parents are dear, but the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are dearer," "A thousand goods and a million goods, but socialism is better"? Deng Tuo, you are daydreaming if you think you can sow discord between the Party and the masses. You will not succeed!
    Si Rongchen, a poor peasant commune member, said: I just came back from being treated at the Shijiazhuang Hospital, and I heard Deng Tuo's anti-Party black words, which filled me with anger! He slandered our Party as "untrustworthy," which is completely nonsense. We people in the disaster area will always follow the Party and our hearts are with Chairman Mao. In this earthquake, my head was severely injured and I fell into a coma. In order to save my life, the Party and Chairman Mao sent me to a large hospital in Shijiazhuang by plane; four or five doctors stayed by my side day and night, giving me injections, changing my medicine, feeding me soup and rice spoon by spoon, and even taking care of my bowel movements, taking better care of me than my own parents. If it weren't for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the good doctors taught by the Party and Chairman Mao, I, the son of a poor peasant, would have either been crushed to death at the time, or died of illness and starvation. Deng Tuo, you dare to slander our great Party. Let me tell you, we must settle accounts with you and thoroughly liquidate your anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes.
        The Communist Party is Completely and Thoroughly for the People
    Ma Quezi, a 63-year-old poor peasant commune member, said: Deng Tuo said that the Communist Party is "unpopular," which even a three-year-old child would not believe. The people will never forget the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao to the people for thousands of years. The day after the earthquake, the Party and Chairman Mao sent countless People's Liberation Army soldiers, work teams, and doctors. They gave all their efforts to us poor and lower-middle peasants. At that time, the weather was still cold, and they were shirtless, rolled up their trousers, and barefoot, coming out of the mud and going into the water to build shelters, build houses, and treat injuries for us. After working hard all day, they would still go to each household at night to visit us. When it was cloudy and rainy, they were afraid that our shelters would leak, so they took their own raincoats and tarpaulins and put them on the roofs of our shelters. They would rather get wet in the rain than let us suffer. Such a good army can only exist under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Deng Tuo, you boast of being "knowledgeable about the past," but you can check which dynasty and which era had such a thing as wholeheartedly serving the people. We have such a good Party, how can we not feel happy? We will never forgive you for slandering our beloved Party!
    Si Renchou, a poor peasant commune member, said: Deng Tuo's attack on the Party as "untrustworthy" and "unpopular" is completely speaking from the standpoint of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. We poor and lower-middle peasants have our own views, and we will make a judgment on who is good and who is bad. Take the socialist education work team in our village as an example. At the critical moment when the earthquake occurred, they did not think about their own life or death, but about the safety of their class brothers. They would rather sacrifice themselves than let the masses get hurt. Team member Li Renbo is a good cadre. When the earthquake occurred, he threw himself on us to protect us, and as a result, he was injured. His injuries were very serious, but he endured the pain and crawled to rescue the masses. Without the good teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, would there be such a good cadre? The Party is so kind and loving to us, how can we not love our Party? Deng Tuo, no poor or lower-middle peasant believes your nonsense about sowing discord between the Party and the masses!
        The People of the Disaster Area Have Their Hearts Set on the Party and Love Chairman Mao
    Wang Luoju, an old poor peasant, said: The kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to the masses in our earthquake-stricken area is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea. At the most critical moment of this earthquake, the first thing I thought of was Chairman Mao's image and Chairman Mao's books. With them, we are not afraid of anything, and we can have anything. The flesh-and-blood relationship between us poor and lower-middle peasants and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is stronger than a boulder and heavier than Mount Tai, which you Deng Tuo cannot destroy. In the old society, I worked as a beast of burden for landlords for more than 20 years, but in the end, I was still a bachelor who could not get enough to eat or wear. After liberation, it was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who led us who had suffered to overthrow the landlords and rich peasants and become masters. I also started a family, started a career, and life got better and better. My personal experience tells me a truth: only by listening to Chairman Mao's words and following the Communist Party can we poor and lower-middle peasants have all happiness. Deng Tuo, you attack our Party, you are trying to dig out the eyes of us poor and lower-middle peasants, that is absolutely impossible!
    Si Pingzhen, a poor peasant young woman, said: Deng Tuo, you scold our Party for being "unpopular," which just shows that our Party is glorious, great, and correct. The Communist Party is like the sun, and Chairman Mao is the great savior of the people. This is the conclusion of history. Deng Tuo, you see how much the people in our disaster area trust and love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. When the earthquake occurred, many poor and lower-middle peasants risked their lives to rescue Chairman Mao's image and Chairman Mao's books first; as soon as the simple shelters were set up, they first posted Chairman Mao's image in the most conspicuous place; whenever we encountered difficulties, as long as we thought of Chairman Mao's words, our spirits would be greatly lifted and our courage to overcome difficulties would increase. We poor and lower-middle peasants not only love the Party and Chairman Mao, but also treat the socialist education work team sent by Chairman Mao as if they were our own brothers and sisters. As soon as the earthquake occurred, regardless of the safety of our family members, we first ran to the residence of the work team and rescued the comrades of the work team one by one. Deng Tuo, I ask you, we poor and lower-middle peasants abandoned our family members in this life-and-death moment to rescue the work team sent by Chairman Mao, does this show that the Communist Party is "unpopular"? It is not our Party that is unpopular, but you Deng Tuo and a handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.
        Resolutely Fight the Enemies Who Do Not Carry Guns to the End
    Wei Fengyin, a poor peasant commune member, said: Deng Tuo is a class enemy who does not carry a gun, but he is even more vicious than the enemies who carry guns. If we do not completely defeat him, he will continue to stir up trouble and dig at the foundations of socialism. This is a life-and-death class struggle, and we must destroy their gang of ghosts and monsters. Now we who hold hoes are peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we are not afraid of heaven or earth, no matter whether it is Deng Tuo or other ghosts and monsters, whoever opposes the leadership of the Party and opposes socialism, we will fight him to the end.
    Wang Xiangxi said: If we want to fight against class enemies who do not carry guns, we must study Chairman Mao's books even harder, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to defeat all ghosts and monsters, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

    党和群众的关系比磐石坚比泰山重
    邢台地震中心地带梅庄大队贫下中农痛斥邓拓一伙的挑拨阴谋
    本报讯　遭受严重地震灾害的邢台专区隆尧县牛家桥公社梅庄大队，经过抗灾斗争，已经安排好群众生活，恢复了集体生产。广大社员正在以万分感激的心情，用实际行动回答党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀和全国人民大力支援的时候，听到邓拓一伙反党反社会主义的言行，听到了他们恶毒攻击我们党“自食其言”、“不堪信任”、“不得人心”的谎言，极为愤怒，严厉谴责叛徒邓拓妄图挑拨党和群众血肉关系的无耻阴谋。
    梅庄大队贫农下中农协会，根据贫下中农的要求，在五月十三日晚上召开了座谈会，大家用铁的事实，愤怒驳斥邓拓的漫天大谎，坚决表示要捣毁“三家村”，彻底闹革命。
      共产党、毛主席是我们的大救星
    贫协主席王香喜说：邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话，简直把我们贫下中农的肺都气炸了。邓拓说共产党“不堪信任”、“不得人心”，纯粹是胡说八道！谁是好人，谁是坏人，我们贫下中农心里最明白。共产党、毛主席是我们的大救星，是我们最亲的亲人，没有共产党和毛主席，就没有我们贫下中农的活路。邓拓想挑拨党和群众的关系，办不到！邓拓，你诬蔑党、攻击党，这完全暴露了你反党反社会主义的本质，完全暴露了你是党和人民的死对头。你要我们党赶快下台“休息”，一切听你们的“指导”，得你们的“人心”，告诉你，这是妄想！我们贫下中农坚决拥护共产党，坚决在党和毛主席领导下走社会主义的光明大道。
    贫农女青年四荣联说：我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，阶级觉悟高，眼光亮，什么香花、毒草，妖魔鬼怪，都能分得清清楚楚。我们一眼就看透了邓拓你这个披着人皮的狼。你攻击党，挑拨党和群众的血肉关系，诬蔑党“看不起群众”、“不堪信任”、“不得人心”。这些话和俺村地主、富农是一个嘴里喷出来的，和蒋介石、赫鲁晓夫是一唱一和。党领导我们推翻了“三座大山”，使旧社会的奴隶做了新社会的主人；党领导我们走上了集体化道路，过上了幸福生活。所有这些，我们贫下中农世世代代也不会忘记。你们这伙黑帮仇视党，向党大放毒箭，吐黑话，只能暴露你们反党反社会主义的原形。我们要坚决和你们斗争到底，彻底打垮你们的黑店，扫除一切牛鬼蛇神，不获全胜，决不收兵。
      没有党，我们就闯不过地震这场灾
    第三生产队贫协委员王西胜说：毛主席早就说过：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”邓拓恶毒地攻击共产党，说什么“不堪信任”、“不得人心”，就是因为我们在共产党和毛主席领导下，斗倒了地主，打倒了恶霸，抄了封建主义的老窝，又打垮了资本主义势力的猖狂进攻，使邓拓一伙牛鬼蛇神不能再骑在我们穷人头上作威作福。我们对共产党，对毛主席无限信赖和无比的热爱，是因为党、毛主席是我们穷人的救命恩人。过去的不用说，就说这次地震灾害发生后，党和毛主席是如何抢救我们灾民的吧。党中央和毛主席连夜给我们派来了解放军、医疗队和各级干部；用飞机投熟食，运病号，抢救我们。全国各地人民听到我们受了灾，从四面八方运来了大米、白面、医药、竹杆、木料、草帘、苇箔和各种各样的农具，西藏、内蒙古、新疆等地的阶级弟兄还给我们运来了大批牲口。正是党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀和全国阶级弟兄的大力支援，我们灾区人民才战胜了天灾，很快安排好生活，恢复了生产。我们灾区人民谁不说“爹亲娘亲，不如共产党、毛主席亲”，“千好万好，不如社会主义好”。邓拓你挑拨党与群众的关系，是白日作梦，不会得逞！
    贫农社员四荣臣说：我刚从石家庄医院治病回来，就听到邓拓的反党黑话，满肚子是气！他诬蔑我们党“不堪信任”，完全是鬼话。我们灾区人民永远跟着党，心向毛主席。这次地震，我的头部严重砸伤了，昏迷不醒。党和毛主席为了抢救我的生命，用飞机把我送到石家庄大医院；四五个医生不分白天黑夜守在我身边，给我打针、换药，一勺一勺地喂汤喂饭，还给我端屎端尿，比亲爹亲娘照顾得还好。要不是共产党、毛主席，要不是党和毛主席教导的好医生，我这个贫农的儿子，当时砸不死，也得病死饿死。邓拓你竟敢诬蔑我们伟大的党。告诉你，我们要同你算账，要彻底清算你的反党反社会主义罪行。
        共产党是完全彻底为人民的
    六十三岁的女贫农社员马缺子说：邓拓说共产党“不得人心”，这连三岁的小孩也不相信。党和毛主席对人民的恩情，人民千年万载也不会忘掉。地震第二天，党和毛主席就派来数不清的解放军、工作队和医生。他们把全部心血都掏给了俺们贫下中农。那时天还正冷，他们光着脊梁，挽着腿，赤着脚，泥里来，水里去，为我们搭窝棚，盖房子，治伤治病，白天劳累一天，黑夜还到各家各户去看望。遇到阴天下雨，他们怕我们的窝棚漏水，拿着自己的雨衣、雨布，给我们搭在棚顶上。他们宁肯在雨里淋着，也不肯让我们受罪。这样好的军队，只有在共产党、毛主席领导下才有啊！邓拓，你自吹“通古”，你查查那朝那代有过这样全心全意为人民服务的事。我们有这样好的党，能不感到幸福吗？你诬蔑我们亲爱的党，俺们绝不饶恕你！
    贫农社员四仁丑说：邓拓攻击党“不堪信任”、“不得人心”，这完全是站在地富反坏的立场上说话。我们贫下中农有我们自己的看法，谁好谁坏，会给他作出判断。就拿我村社会主义教育工作队来说吧，在地震发生的紧要关头，他们想到的不是自己的生死，而是阶级弟兄的安危，他们宁肯牺牲自己，也不让群众负伤。队员李仁波就是个好干部。地震发生时，他为了保护我们，扑在我们身上，结果他被砸伤了。他的伤势很重，还忍着疼痛，爬去抢救群众。要不是党和毛主席的好教导，会有这样的好干部吗？党对我们这样的亲，这样的爱，我们怎么能不热爱我们的党呢？邓拓，你挑拨党和群众的关系，任何贫下中农都不相信你的鬼话！
        灾区人民心向党，热爱毛主席
    老贫农王洛居说：共产党、毛主席对我们地震灾区群众的恩情，比天高、比海深。在这次地震的最紧要关头，我首先想到的是毛主席的象和毛主席的书，有了它，我们什么也不怕，什么也能有。我们贫下中农和共产党、毛主席的血肉关系，比磐石坚，比泰山重，不是你邓拓能破坏得了的。我在旧社会，给地主当牛做马二十多年，到头来还是一个吃不饱、穿不暖的单身汉。解放后，是共产党和毛主席领导我们受苦人，打倒了地主富农，翻身做了主人。我也成了家，立了业，日子越过越好。我的亲身经历告诉我一个真理：只有听毛主席的话，跟着共产党走，才有我们贫下中农的一切幸福。邓拓你攻击我们的党，就是要挖我们贫下中农的眼珠子，那是万万办不到的！
    贫农女青年四平珍说：邓拓你骂我们党“不得人心”，正说明我们党光荣、伟大、正确。共产党象太阳，毛主席是人民的大救星，这是历史的结论。邓拓你看看我们灾区人民是多么信赖和热爱共产党和毛主席的吧。在地震发生的时候，有许多贫下中农，冒着生命的危险，把毛主席象和毛主席的书首先抢救出来；简易窝棚刚刚搭起，又是先把毛主席象贴在最显眼的地方；在我们遇到困难的时刻，只要一想到毛主席的话，精神顿然振作，增加了克服困难的勇气。我们贫下中农不光对党、对毛主席热爱，就是对毛主席派来的社会主义教育工作队，也是亲如手足。地震一发生，我们不管家里亲人的安危，首先跑到工作队的住处，把工作队同志一个一个救了出来。邓拓，我问你，我们贫下中农在这生死关头，丢下家里的亲人去抢救毛主席派来的工作队，这能说明共产党“不得人心”吗？不得人心的不是我们党，而是你邓拓一小撮反党反社会主义分子。
        坚决同不拿枪的敌人斗到底
    贫农社员魏风印说：邓拓是个不拿枪的阶级敌人，可是他比拿枪的敌人还恶毒。我们不彻底斗垮他，他还会出来兴风作浪，挖社会主义的墙脚。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，非把他们这一伙牛鬼蛇神摧毁不可。现在我们拿锄钩的人，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民，天不怕，地不怕，不管是邓拓或者是其他牛鬼蛇神，谁反对党的领导、反对社会主义，我们就要和他拼到底。
    王香喜说：我们要想同不拿枪的阶级敌人作斗争，就更得好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器斗垮一切牛鬼蛇神，坚决把社会主义革命进行到底。
