    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 19th -- "Voice of Laos" radio station published a commentary on the 18th, strongly condemning the war provocation action of the American bandit planes publicly invading the airspace of Yunnan Province, China on the 12th.
    The commentary pointed out that this is a long-planned action by American imperialism to attempt to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to China. This crazy and adventurous action by American imperialism makes it clear to the people of the world that Washington's so-called "improving relations with China" is nothing more than a rhetoric to deceive world opinion and a smokescreen for attacking China, while its essence remains bellicose and aggressive.
    The commentary warmly welcomed and fully supported the four sentences of China's policy toward the United States as clarified by Premier Zhou Enlai on April 10 when he met with the reporter of the Pakistani newspaper *Dawn*, and believed that "only this position can make American imperialism clearly see that the era of their doing whatever they want is gone."
    The commentary said that the Lao people have fought against American imperialism and continuously achieved victories and grown stronger; 30 million Vietnamese people have also turned more than 200,000 American aggressors into a daze; if American imperialism dares to take the crazy risk of invading China, then 650 million Chinese people who have long been prepared will surely drive it to the bottom of the East Sea; the 3 million Lao people with the people of two great countries beside them will also drive American imperialism to the bottom of the Mekong River.
    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 19th -- The Rawalpindi National People's Party of Pakistan passed a resolution at a meeting held on the 18th, saying that the war provocation incident of American aircraft invading Chinese airspace and shooting down a Chinese aircraft is not just an isolated or accidental event, but part of a planned and gradual expansion of the Vietnam War. The gradual expansion of the Vietnam War is the national policy adopted by the current US government.
    The resolution said: "The Rawalpindi National People's Party most strongly condemns the provocative act of American military aircraft entering the border of the People's Republic of China."
    The resolution pointed out that American imperialists, facing total collapse in the brutal war of aggression against the Vietnamese people, are preparing to launch an attack on China - Pakistan's neighbor and friend.
    The resolution also said: "The provocative actions and aggressive conspiracies of the new American fascists are a provocation to the conscience of the world, especially a provocation to our expression of friendship and solidarity with the people's China."
    The resolution advocates that Pakistan should take a clear and principled stand on this issue and actively participate in the world people's anti-imperialist struggle to frustrate the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 19th -- The Ceylon weekly *Sinhala* published an editorial on the 19th on the provocative action of American aircraft recently invading the airspace of Yunnan Province, China, and attacking Chinese aircraft, saying: "The aggressive actions of American imperialism must be stopped immediately."
    The editorial pointed out that this is obviously a provocative action taken by American imperialism. American imperialism is pushing its war of aggression against the Vietnamese people to a new level.
    The editorial said that the United States should abandon its hypocritical and deceptive policy being pursued on the Vietnam issue and withdraw its troops from Vietnam. The editorial said that the Vietnam issue can only be resolved if the United States withdraws its troops from Vietnam and abides by the 1954 Geneva Accords.
    The editorial said: The United States must abandon its piratical policy of infringing on the land, sea and air rights of other countries.
    The editorial said, "Anyone who respects justice, reason, and international law will not cooperate with the aggressive policies of the United States."
    Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 19th -- The *Vanguard* here said today that the action of American aircraft invading the airspace of the northeast region of Maguan, Yunnan Province, China, and ambushing and shooting down a Chinese training flight, "is a rampant provocation, and it also reminds people that American imperialism is preparing to expand the war, attempting to find a way out of the predicament."
    The *Vanguard* said that in South Vietnam, "American imperialism is facing a situation of intertwined military crisis and political crisis."
    The newspaper said that militarily, the people's armed forces are getting stronger and stronger, and the American aggressors are suffering heavy defeats.
    Politically, the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime is crumbling. Contradictions within the puppet regime are becoming increasingly acute. In the constantly shrinking enemy-occupied areas, the people's struggle is constantly rising, demanding that the Americans get out.
    The newspaper pointed out that no matter how American imperialism prepares to expand the war adventure, it cannot escape the law of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until its destruction, as pointed out by Chairman Mao Zedong.

    各国舆论强烈谴责美国飞机侵犯中国领空罪行
    美帝胆敢冒犯中国，必将葬身东海
    不管美帝如何扩大战争新冒险都逃脱不了失败的命运
    新华社康开十九日电  “老挝之声”电台十八日发表评论，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机十二日公然入侵中国云南省上空的战争挑衅行动。
    评论指出，这是美帝国主义企图把侵略越南的战争扩大到中国的蓄谋已久的行动。美帝国主义这一疯狂和冒险的行动，使世界人民清楚地看到华盛顿叫嚷的所谓
  “同中国改善关系”的论调，只不过是为了欺骗世界舆论和作为进攻中国的烟幕，而它的本质仍然是好战和侵略的。
    评论热烈欢迎和完全支持周恩来总理四月十日在接见巴基斯坦《黎明报》记者时所阐明的中国对美国政策的四句话，并且认为，“只有这一立场才能使美帝国主义清楚看到，它们为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。”
    评论说，老挝人民同美帝国主义进行了斗争并连续取得胜利和日益强大；三千万越南人民也已经把二十多万美国侵略军打得晕头转向；美帝国主义胆敢疯狂冒险地侵略中国，那末，早就作好准备的六亿五千万中国人民，必将把它赶下东海海底；有着两个伟大国家人民在旁边的三百万老挝人民，也必将把美帝国主义赶下湄公河河底。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十九日电　巴基斯坦的拉瓦尔品第民族人民党在十八日举行的会议上通过决议说，美国飞机侵入中国领空并击落一架中国飞机的战争挑衅事件，这不只是一件孤立的事件或者偶然事件，而是蓄意逐步扩大越南战争的计划的一部分。逐步扩大越南战争是美国现政府采取的国策。
    决议说：“拉瓦尔品第民族人民党最强烈地谴责美国军用飞机侵入中华人民共和国国境进行挑衅的行为。”
    决议指出，在侵略越南人民的残酷战争中面临全面崩溃的美帝国主义者，正在准备对中国——巴基斯坦的邻邦和朋友——发动进攻。
    决议还说：“美国新法西斯分子的挑衅行动和侵略阴谋，是对世界良心的挑衅，特别是对我们要同人民中国友好和团结一致的表示的一种挑衅。”
    决议主张巴基斯坦在这个问题上应当采取明确而有原则的立场，积极参加世界人民的反帝斗争，来挫败美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    新华社科伦坡十九日电　锡兰《僧伽罗》周刊十九日就美国飞机最近侵入中国云南省上空，袭击中国飞机的挑衅行动发表社论说：“必须立即制止美帝国主义的侵略行为。”
    社论指出，这显然是美帝国主义采取的一个挑衅行动。美帝国主义正在把它对越南人民的侵略战争推向新的一级。
    社论说，美国应该放弃它在越南问题上正在推行的虚伪和欺骗的政策，而把它的军队撤出越南。社论说，只有美国军队撤出越南和遵守一九五四年日内瓦协议，越南问题才能解决。
    社论说：美国必须放弃它的侵犯其他国家的陆、海、空权利的海盗政策。
    社论说，“任何尊重正义、道理和国际法的人决不会同美国的侵略政策合作。”
    新华社墨尔本十九日电　这里的《先锋报》今天说，美国飞机侵入中国云南省马关东北地区上空，偷袭和击落中国训练飞行的飞机一架的行动，“是一个猖狂的挑衅，它也提醒人们注意，美帝国主义正在准备扩大战争，企图找到一条摆脱两难处境的出路。”
    《先锋报》说，在越南南方，“美帝国主义所面临的是军事危机和政治危机交织的局面。”
    报纸说，在军事上，人民武装力量愈战愈强，美国侵略者正在遭到惨重失败。
    在政治上，阮高其伪政权摇摇欲坠。伪政权内部矛盾日益尖锐。在不断缩小的敌占区内人民的斗争不断高涨，要求美国人滚出去。
    报纸指出，不管美帝国主义如何准备扩大战争冒险，它都逃不脱毛泽东主席指出的捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡的规律。
