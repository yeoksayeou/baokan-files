    Daring to expose contradictions and recognize contradictions is a question of daring to make revolution.
    Chairman Mao said: "The interdependence and struggle of the contradictory aspects in all things determine the life of all things and promote the development of all things. There is nothing that does not contain contradictions; without contradictions, there would be no world."① We, in engaging in socialist construction and socialist revolution, must constantly expose contradictions in our work, recognize contradictions, and correctly handle and resolve contradictions to promote the development of contradictions in a direction favorable to the cause of socialist revolution. This is the duty of a revolutionary cadre, a question of revolutionizing work, and an attitude towards the revolutionary cause. In 1963, our Shanghai Fruit and Grocery Company, Zhabei District Company, improved the quality of service and reduced losses compared to previous years in its watermelon business. However, compared with other units, the watermelons we managed were still prone to spoilage and high in cost.
    Due to the correct policies of the Party, in 1964, the enthusiasm of our farmer brothers greatly increased, agricultural production developed, and watermelons also had a bumper harvest. Before the watermelon season arrived, the higher-level organization arranged for us to go to the countryside to survey the watermelon production situation. We all saw that the watermelon seedlings in the fields were growing well, with many melons, a scene of a bumper harvest. There was no doubt that our watermelon sales task in 1964 would increase by 50 percent compared to 1963.
    With the amount of watermelons on the market greatly increased, could we vigorously reduce losses and costs? This was indeed a major problem facing our company.
    In the past, although I had studied Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction," my study was superficial. This time I restudied "On Contradiction." Studying with the problem of how to sell watermelons in mind made me deeply realize that to do a good job of selling watermelons, we must recognize the contradictions in this work, expose them, and resolve them. I also went to the masses with the problem of watermelons being easily spoiled and the heavy task to understand what contradictions existed in selling watermelons. After investigation and research, I clarified that the contradictions in selling watermelons mainly lie in: the contradiction between the surge of arrivals during peak periods and the inadequacy of sales forces, that is, the contradiction of "supply exceeding demand," specifically manifested in the contradiction that there are few sales outlets, the personnel strength is weak, and it cannot meet the requirements of expanded sales; the contradiction that the number of arrivals is large, the transportation force is weak, and there is not enough stacking space; in addition, there are many problems in management work, business technology, and other aspects.
      Taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle,
  correctly handling various contradictions is a matter of revolutionary practice.
    Studying "On Contradiction" provided enlightenment, and after investigation, the contradictions in the watermelon sales work were discovered. However, discovering the contradictions does not mean that they are resolved. To resolve the contradiction of many watermelons and no spoilage, first of all, all comrades in the company must have the confidence to solve this contradiction. Most comrades had this confidence, but a few comrades had a fear of difficulty. Some said: "Wouldn't it be better if there were fewer watermelons?" Some said: "Watermelons are easy to spoil and cannot be hidden. This year's task is so heavy. It would be a good thing to be able to not lose money or lose less money." This shows that to do a good job of this year's watermelon work, we must resolve the contradiction between fear of difficulty and full confidence. Since inspiration was gained from studying Chairman Mao's works and the contradictions in the watermelon sales work were found, then solving the ideological contradictions in the watermelon work must also draw strength from Chairman Mao's works.
    Therefore, we studied Chairman Mao's articles "Serve the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains."
    In "Serve the People," Chairman Mao said: "Our team is entirely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the interests of the people."② This tells us that although there are different divisions of labor in revolutionary work, no matter what work we do, we must serve the people wholeheartedly. Selling watermelons is also part of revolutionary work. To sell watermelons well, satisfy consumers, and satisfy producers, we must establish the idea of serving the people everywhere and considering the interests of the people everywhere. After studying, we understood that although there were many watermelons last year, the weather was hot, and there would definitely be more people buying watermelons. If we do not actively expand sales, consumers will not be able to eat good watermelons, we will not be able to promote and support production, and the state will lose money. How can this be considered serving the people? Serving the people is not abstract, it must be concrete. The farmer brothers have worked hard to grow more watermelons to supply the urban people for enjoyment, and our commercial workers must strive to deliver all the watermelons well to the consumers. For us commercial workers, to serve the people, in the current situation, is to sell watermelons well. We must support production, meet consumption, and ensure the quality of watermelons, establishing the idea of ensuring production, ensuring quality, and ensuring consumption. Chairman Mao said in "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains": For the two great mountains weighing on the Chinese people now - imperialism and feudalism, "The Chinese Communist Party has long made up its mind to dig up these two mountains. We must persevere and work unceasingly..."③ Sure enough, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people rose up together and dug away the two mountains of imperialism and feudalism. The Chinese revolution finally achieved victory. This fully proves that as long as we have confidence and are not afraid of sacrifice, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome by us. We must overcome the difficulties in selling watermelons with unwavering determination and unyielding perseverance. The ancient Foolish Old Man was able to make up his mind to move two great mountains. We must be even more determined to move the "rotten watermelon" mountain in the work of selling watermelons.
    The ideological contradictions drew strength from Chairman Mao's works and were resolved. However, there is indeed a contradiction between the heavy task and the weak forces in terms of working methods. Where do the methods come from? We still have to find them in Chairman Mao's works. So we studied Chairman Mao's "Concentrate a Superior Force to Destroy the Enemy Forces One by One." Chairman Mao said: "In the deployment of campaigns, when the enemy uses many brigades (or regiments) to advance on our army in several routes, our army must concentrate an absolutely superior force, that is, concentrate six times, or five times, or four times the enemy's force, at least three times the enemy's force, at the appropriate time, first surround and annihilate one brigade (or regiment) of the enemy."④
    Chairman Mao's words tell us that we must concentrate an absolutely superior force to deal with the enemy. Only in this way can we annihilate the enemy and achieve victory. Although this passage refers to military issues, is it also applicable to solving problems such as selling watermelons? Facts prove that it is also applicable. In addition to selling watermelons, our company also has to deal with other fruits, north-south goods, tobacco and alcohol, pastries, and other businesses. Following the old method of dividing forces equally will not destroy the enemy of rotten watermelons. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, concentrate a superior force, and fight this battle of selling watermelons well. Therefore, we adopted the measures of adjusting counters, compressing manpower and space from other fronts, and increasing and expanding the watermelon supply force. For example, there are seven Southern Goods stores in the Guangzhao area, with only over forty people in total, mostly old, weak, and women, with few people and few young and strong people, and the location is relatively remote. In order to undertake the sales task of more than two thousand loads, in addition to the supply of watermelons to each unit's store, they also drew a part of the personnel to concentrate their forces to transport and sell watermelons. For another example, the Liankang Southern Goods Store does not usually operate fruit business, but this time, in addition to drawing out a part of the personnel to sell watermelons, it also concentrated the personnel from other counters to sell watermelons during the peak watermelon business period. For another example, in order to undertake the sales task of six thousand loads, the North Station Department drew twenty-four people from each counter to sell watermelons. They were divided into three groups: inner warehouse, sorting, and acceptance, and the outer counter was divided into small groups such as on-site consumption, supply to factories, door-to-door whole sales, and sliced supply, compressing the sales personnel of the southern goods counter to only two people. In this way, the force selling watermelons was greatly concentrated, creating good conditions for fighting the battle of selling watermelons well.
      Grasp the main contradictions, solve the
  contradictions fiercely, and promote the progress of work.
    Chairman Mao said: "In certain times of revolutionary struggle, difficult conditions exceed favorable conditions. In such times, difficulty is the main aspect of the contradiction, and smoothness is the secondary aspect. However, due to the efforts of the revolutionaries, they can gradually overcome the difficulties and develop a new situation of smoothness, and the difficult situation gives way to the smooth situation."⑤ This tells us that the contradictions existing in the work of selling watermelons, currently, the main aspect is the difficulty, but as long as we actively create conditions and take measures to solve the contradictions in the work of selling watermelons fiercely, the difficult situation is not immutable, and it can be transformed into a smooth situation. Last year, during a typhoon in late July, several thousand loads of watermelons were heating up in the ship's hold and were about to rot immediately. It was raining heavily at the time. Due to the establishment of the idea of serving the people, cadres and the masses, soaked with rain, also rushed to transport the watermelons from the ship's hold to the store overnight in the rain. If there are few supply outlets, we took measures to supply watermelons to all the southern goods stores that did not originally operate fruit business, and also took measures such as setting up stalls for supply, mobile supply, and factory supply, so that the original twenty-nine outlets were expanded to one hundred and eighteen. If there are few people, we first rested before the watermelon sales peak or made up for rest after the peak, which is equivalent to increasing the labor force by one-tenth, plus most of the personnel were concentrated to transport and sell watermelons during the peak period, from the original more than one hundred people operating the fruit business to more than three hundred people. Based on the experience of 1963, the peak period for watermelon arrivals is from July 25th to the beginning of August (an average of about 5,000 to 8,000 loads per day). We adopted the method of selling as they arrived before the peak, resolutely not leaving any inventory, and welcoming the peak with an empty stomach. We adopted the method of frequently turning and tidying up watermelons with good physique and easy preservation to reduce the rate of rot and prepare for the needs of supplying the market on the Beginning of Autumn. There were few watermelon stacking places. With the strong support of relevant departments, we temporarily borrowed a place that could store 9,000 loads of watermelons. The use of trucks to transport watermelons in the past was one of the important reasons for the large losses. Last year, we inspected all vehicles and made full use of the transportation forces of small three-wheel trucks in each unit. Last year, the number of self-transported watermelons reached 87%, which not only reduced costs but also reduced losses. In terms of leadership style, improvements were also made. The company organs reduced meetings, and analyzed the arrival and sales situation, climate changes, and ideological dynamics every night after 10:00 p.m., and took timely dispatching measures. On the day of the Beginning of Autumn, Shanghai people have the habit of eating watermelons. We organized personnel to go all out to rush the nearly 2,000 loads of watermelons stacked on the wharf to retail stores on the night before the Beginning of Autumn. All the stored watermelons were sold, so that most of the watermelon shops did not experience out-of-stock phenomena. The above-mentioned series of measures created conditions for the transformation of contradictions - turning difficulties into advantages. Therefore, compared with the previous year, the work of selling watermelons last year: the sales volume increased by 79% compared with the previous year, the expense rate decreased from 15.8% to 10.65%, the loss decreased from 4.5% to 1.72%, the gross profit rate increased from 17.4% to 23.76%, and the surplus was more than 19,000 yuan, increasing the accumulation for socialist construction.

    Last year's watermelon sales work started from studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" to discover the contradictions in the work, and then from studying "On Contradiction" to obtain the method of solving the contradictions, turning the spirit into material force. It made me deeply realize that: as a revolutionary cadre, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, we must study with problems in mind, and draw strength from Chairman Mao's works. This is a powerful ideological weapon for transforming the subjective world and the objective world.

    谈谈大城市卖西瓜的哲学问题
    周信礼
    敢不敢揭露矛盾，敢不敢认识矛盾，是敢不敢革命的问题
    毛主席说：“一切事物中包含的矛盾方面的相互依赖和相互斗争，决定一切事物的生命，推动一切事物的发展。没有什么事物是不包含矛盾的，没有矛盾就没有世界。”①我们搞社会主义建设和社会主义革命，必须不断地揭露工作中的矛盾，认识矛盾，正确地处理与解决矛盾，促进矛盾朝着有利于社会主义革命事业的方向发展。这是一个革命干部的职责，是工作革命化的问题，亦是对待革命事业的态度问题。一九六三年我们上海市果品杂货公司闸北区公司经营西瓜业务，虽然比以往几年在服务质量方面有了提高，损耗率有所降低。但是与其他单位比较，我们经营的西瓜仍然是烂耗大、费用高。
    由于党的政策正确，一九六四年，农民兄弟生产积极性大大提高，农业生产发展了，西瓜又获得了大丰收。在收西瓜的季节到来之前，上级组织我们到农村去踏看西瓜的生产情况。我们都看到，田里的西瓜苗长势好、结瓜多，一派丰收景象。估计我们一九六四年西瓜销售任务要比一九六三年增加百分之五十，则是毫无疑问的了。
    西瓜上市量大大增加了，我们能否大力降低损耗、降低费用呢？这确实是摆在我们公司面前的一个大问题。
    以往我虽然也学习过毛主席的《矛盾论》，但学习得很肤浅。这次又重新学习了《矛盾论》。带着如何卖西瓜这个问题进行学习，使我深刻地认识到要把卖西瓜这样的工作做好，就必须认识这一工作中的矛盾，揭露矛盾，解决矛盾。我又带着西瓜容易烂、任务重的问题，到群众那里去了解卖西瓜到底有些什么矛盾。经过调查研究，使自己明确了：在卖西瓜工作中的矛盾，主要是：高峰时到货涌，销售力量不相适应的矛盾，也就是存在“供过于求”的矛盾，具体表现在销售网点少，人员力量弱，不能适应扩大销售要求的矛盾；到货数量大，运输力量薄弱，堆放场地不够的矛盾；此外管理工作、业务技术等方面亦存在不少问题。
      以毛泽东思想挂帅，正确处
  理各种矛盾，是革命实践的问题
    学习《矛盾论》，得到了启发，经过调查，发现了西瓜销售工作中的矛盾。但是，发现了矛盾并不等于就解决了矛盾。要解决西瓜多而不烂的矛盾，首先就要公司全体同志都有解决这个矛盾的信心。多数同志有这种信心，少数同志却存在着畏难情绪。有的说：“西瓜少来一些不是很好吗？”有的说：“西瓜容易烂又不能藏起来，今年任务又这样重，能够做到不亏本或少亏本已经是好事情。”这就说明要把今年西瓜工作做好，必须解决畏难情绪与满怀信心之间的矛盾。既然从学习毛主席著作中得到启发，找到了销售西瓜的工作中的矛盾，那末解决西瓜工作中思想上的矛盾，还得从毛主席著作中吸取力量。
    于是，我们就学习毛主席《为人民服务》与《愚公移山》这两篇文章。
    在《为人民服务》一文中，毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”②这就告诉我们革命工作虽有分工的不同，但，无论干哪一行工作，都必须是全心全意地为人民服务。卖瓜的工作亦是革命工作的一部分。要把瓜卖好，使消费者满意，使生产者满意，就必须树立处处为人民服务，处处为人民利益着想的思想。经过学习，使我们懂得：去年西瓜虽多，但天气热，买西瓜的一定也会多起来。如果我们不积极扩大销售，消费者又吃不到好瓜，既不能促进与支持生产，国家又要亏本，怎么能算为人民服务呢？为人民服务，不是抽象的，必须是具体的。农民兄弟辛辛苦苦地多种了瓜，要供给城市人民享用，我们的商业工作者就要力求把所有的瓜都好好送到消费者手里。对于我们这些商业工作者来说，要为人民服务，在当前，就要把西瓜卖好。我们必须支持生产、满足消费，要保证西瓜的质量，树立保生产、保质量、保消费的思想。毛主席在《愚公移山》这篇文章中说：对于现在压在中国人民头上的两座大山——帝国主义和封建主义，“中国共产党早就下了决心，要挖掉这两座山。我们一定要坚持下去，一定要不断地工作……。”③果然，在党中央和毛主席领导下，我们中国人民一齐起来挖掉了帝国主义和封建主义这两座大山。中国革命终于取得了胜利。这完全证明，只要我们有信心，不怕牺牲，再大的困难，也可以被我们所克服。我们必须要以坚定不移的决心，坚韧不拔的毅力，克服卖西瓜工作中的困难。古代的愚公能够下定决心搬掉两座大山，我们更要下定决心，搬掉卖西瓜工作中“烂瓜”这座大山。
    思想上的矛盾从毛主席著作中吸取了力量，得到了解决。但是在工作办法上亦确实存在着任务重与力量弱之间的矛盾。办法从那里来呢？还得到毛主席著作中去找。于是我们又学习了毛主席的《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》一文。毛主席说：“在战役的部署方面，当着敌人使用许多个旅（或团）分几路向我军前进的时候，我军必须集中绝对优势的兵力，即集中六倍、或五倍、或四倍于敌的兵力、至少也要有三倍于敌的兵力，于适当时机，首先包围歼击敌军的一个旅（或团）。”④
    毛主席这段话告诉我们对付敌人必须集中绝对优势的兵力，只有这样，才能歼灭敌人，取得胜利。这段话虽然是对军事问题而言，对于解决卖西瓜这样的问题，是否也适用呢？事实证明也是适用的。我们公司除了经营西瓜外，还得经营其他水果、南北货、烟酒、糕点等其他业务，要按照平分兵力的老办法，是不能歼灭烂西瓜这个敌人的。我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，集中优势兵力，打好卖西瓜这一仗。于是我们采取调整柜台，压缩其他战线的人力与场地，增加与扩大西瓜供应力量。象广肇地区有七家南货店，总共仅四十多人，老弱多，妇女多，人员少，年轻力壮少，地段比较偏僻。为了承担二千多担销售任务，他们除了各单位门市供应西瓜外，还抽一部分人员集中力量运瓜卖瓜。再如象联康南货店平时不经营水果业务，但这次却除了抽出一部分人员卖瓜外，还在西瓜营业高峰时，集中其他柜台人员卖瓜。再如北站门市部为了承担六千担销售任务，他们从各柜台抽出二十四人卖瓜。他们划分为内仓、整理、验收三个组，外柜又划分为堂吃、下厂供应、门售整只、切块供应等小组，把南货柜销售人员压缩到仅存两个人。这样，卖西瓜的兵力就大大集中了，给打好卖西瓜这一仗创造了良好的条件。
      抓住主要矛盾，狠狠地解决
  矛盾，推动工作前进
    毛主席说：“革命斗争中的某些时候，困难条件超过顺利条件，在这种时候，困难是矛盾的主要方面，顺利是其次要方面。然而由于革命党人的努力，能够逐步地克服困难，开展顺利的新局面，困难的局面让位于顺利的局面。”⑤这就告诉我们卖西瓜工作中存在的矛盾，当前，主要方面是困难，但是只要积极地创造条件，采取措施，狠狠地解决卖西瓜工作中的矛盾，困难的局面不是一成不变的，是可以转化为顺利的局面的。去年七月下旬一次台风，有几千担西瓜在船舱内发热，马上就要腐烂。当时正下着大雨。由于树立了为人民服务的思想，干部与群众，淋湿了衣服，也冒雨把西瓜从船舱内连夜抢运到商店。供应网点少，就采取了把原来不经营水果业务的南货店全部供应西瓜，同时还采取设摊供应、流动供应、下厂供应等措施，使原来二十九个网点扩大到一百十八个。人员少，就在卖西瓜高峰前先休息或高峰后补休，这样等于增加劳动力十分之一，再加上高峰时绝大部分人员均集中起来运瓜卖瓜，从原来经营水果业务一百多人增加到三百多人。根据一九六三年的经验，西瓜到货高峰是七月二十五日到八月初这一段时间（平均每天要达五千担到八千担左右），我们就采取高峰前随到随销，坚决不留库存，空肚子迎接高峰的办法。把身骨好、容易保藏的西瓜采取勤翻勤整理的办法，降低腐烂率，准备立秋供应市场的需要。西瓜堆放场地少，我们在有关部门大力支持下，临时借到可以存放九千担西瓜的场地。前年用卡车运瓜，是产生损耗大的重要原因之一。去年我们对所有车辆进行检修，并充分使用各单位小三卡、三轮车的运输力量。去年西瓜的自运数量达到百分之八十七，既减少费用又降低损耗。在领导作风方面，也作了改进。公司机关减少了会议，每天晚上十时以后分析到货及销售情况，气候变化及思想动态，及时采取调度措施。立秋这一天，上海人有吃瓜的习惯，我们就组织人员全力以赴地把码头上堆放的近二千担西瓜在立秋前夜突击运到零售店，库存西瓜全部出售，使大部分卖瓜商店未发生脱销现象。上述一系列措施，为矛盾的转化——困难转化为有利创造了条件。因此，去年卖西瓜的工作与前年比较：销售数量比前年增加百分之七十九，费用率从百分之十五点八下降到百分之十点六五，损耗从百分之四点五降低到百分之一点七二，毛利率从百分之十七点四上升到百分之二十三点七六，盈余一万九千多元，为社会主义建设增加了积累。
                      ×　×　×
    去年卖西瓜的工作是从学习毛主席的《矛盾论》开始发现工作中的矛盾，又从学习《矛盾论》中得到解决矛盾的办法，使精神变成物质力量。使我深刻地认识到：作为一个革命干部必须认真学习毛主席著作，必须带着问题去学，从毛主席著作中吸取力量。这是改造主观世界和客观世界的强大的思想武器。（本文作者系上海市果品杂货公司闸北区公司经理）
