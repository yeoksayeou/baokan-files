    Thoroughly Eliminate Deng Tuo's Black Gang
    Deng Tuo's statement that the Party "looks down on the masses" and "does not value the wisdom of the masses" is a complete slander against the Party. The "masses" Deng Tuo refers to are anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and the "wisdom" Deng Tuo refers to is anti-Party and anti-socialist "wisdom."
    Huang Rongchang, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Deputy Chief Engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company

    After reading Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk, I was simply bursting with anger. This fellow waves the "red flag" while opposing the red flag, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism while engaging in revisionist activities. He releases one poisonous arrow after another, all aimed at our great Party and great leader. It is very clear that his conspiracy is to attempt to overthrow the Party and let their gang of right-leaning opportunists take power, engage in revisionism, and drag us back to the old road of capitalism. Let me tell you frankly, Deng Tuo! This is wishful thinking, you are having a nightmare! Our struggle with you is a life-and-death class struggle, a matter of paramount importance related to defending the Party, defending Mao Zedong Thought, and defending the socialist state. As the leading class of the country, we, the working class, must stand at the forefront of the struggle, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly uproot your black flag!
    Our Party is a glorious, great, and correct Party. Our Party represents the highest interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and serves the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. The Party leads us in making revolution, advancing from one victory to another. The fate of the Party is our fate. Without the Party, we would have nothing. The relationship between the Party and us is one of flesh and blood. The Party cannot do without us, and we cannot do without the Party. We will fight to the death against anyone who dares to slander our Party or attack our Party. Deng Tuo attempts to sow discord between the Party and the masses, saying that the Party leadership is "wise in its own conceit, looks down on the masses," does not value the wisdom of the masses, and "does not accept the good opinions of the masses below." This is complete nonsense! Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "The people, and only the people, are the driving force in the making of world history." Our Party has always believed in and relied on the masses, consulted with the masses in everything, and fully utilized the wisdom and strength of the masses. The great achievements in socialist construction over the past sixteen years since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, such as the emergence of Daqing Oilfield, the manufacture of the 12,000-ton hydraulic press, the success of two atomic bombs and the recent nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, are all the result of our Party relying on the masses and fully utilizing their wisdom. Take our Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, for example. It has developed from a dilapidated small steel factory into a modern integrated iron and steel enterprise, and the production outlook has been completely renewed. The variety of steel has increased from one or two before the Great Leap Forward to fifty or sixty, and the quality of steel has reached 99.9 percent. The quality of some steel even reaches or exceeds international standards. Are these not all tremendous achievements made under the leadership of the Party by fully utilizing the wisdom of the masses? Over the past ten years, our mechanical workshop has completed 97 innovation projects and improved and created more than 230 various mechanical equipment, all of which have been realized by relying on the masses under the leadership of the Party. I myself had no right to speak at all in the old society. After liberation, I was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress and discussed national affairs with national leaders once a year. There are many, many people like me across the country. Deng Tuo, on what basis do you slander our Party for looking down on the masses and not accepting the opinions of the masses?
    Deng Tuo, what kind of "masses" are your so-called "masses"? Your "masses" are those "杂家 [miscellaneous specialists]," bourgeois elements, landlord class elements, and the intellectuals of these classes, that is, right-leaning opportunists. You want us to believe the so-called "wisdom" of these guys and listen to the "good" opinions of these so-called "masses." What kind of "wisdom" is this? It is the "wisdom" of opposing the Party and socialism, the "wisdom" of advocating for right-leaning opportunism! What kind of "good opinions" are these? They are the "good opinions" that our Party should "not say anything," "not do anything," and quickly step down to "rest"! Accepting these so-called "wisdom" and "good opinions" would not that mean letting right-leaning opportunists and demons and monsters take power, capitalism be restored, and the entire China change color?
    Our struggle with Deng Tuo is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. Is Mao Zedong Thought in the lead or is revisionism in power? The question is very clear. In this struggle, we must resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and open fire on your gang of demons and monsters. We will not withdraw until we win.

    彻底清除邓拓这个黑帮
    邓拓说党“看不起群众”、“不重视群众的智慧”，是对党彻头彻尾的污蔑。邓拓所谓的“群众”就是反党反社会主义分子，邓拓所谓的“智慧”就是反党反社会主义的“智慧”
    全国人民代表大会代表、重庆钢铁公司副总工程师　黄荣昌
    看了邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话，简直把我的肚子都气爆了。这个家伙打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马列主义的外衣干着修正主义的勾当。他放出一支支毒箭，都是针对着我们伟大的党，伟大的领袖。很明显，他的阴谋就是企图把党赶下台，让他们一伙右倾机会主义分子上台，搞修正主义，把我们拖回资本主义的老路。老实告诉你，邓拓！你这是妄想，你这是做鬼梦！我们和你的斗争，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，是关系到保卫党保卫毛泽东思想保卫社会主义江山的头等大事。我们工人阶级作为国家的领导阶级，一定要站在斗争的最前列，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，彻底拔掉你这个黑旗！
    我们的党是光荣、伟大、正确的党，我们的党是代表中国人民和世界人民的最高利益的，是全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的。党领导着我们干革命，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。党的命运就是我们的命运，没有党，就没有我们的一切。党和我们的关系是血肉关系，党离不开我们，我们离不开党。那个胆敢污蔑我们的党，攻击我们的党，我们就要同他作拼死的斗争。邓拓企图挑拨党和群众的关系，说什么党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”，不重视群众的智慧，“不接受下面群众的好意见”，这完全是胡说八道！毛主席一再教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们党从来就是相信群众，依靠群众，事事同群众商量，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量的。解放十六年来，特别是大跃进以来，社会主义各项建设事业取得的伟大成就，譬如大庆油田的出现，一万二千吨水压机的制成，两颗原子弹和最近含有热核材料的核爆炸的成功，都是我们党依靠群众，充分发挥群众智慧的结果。就说我们重钢吧，从过去一个破烂的小钢厂发展成为一个现代化的联合钢铁企业，生产面貌焕然一新，钢的品种从大跃进以前的一两种，增加到五六十种，钢的质量达到了百分之九十九点九，有的钢材质量达到甚至超过了国际水平，难道这些不是在党的领导下，充分发挥群众智慧取得的巨大成就吗？十多年来，我们机械化车间搞成了九十七种革新项目，改进和创造了二百三十多台各种机械设备，都是在党领导下依靠群众实现的。我自己在旧社会根本没有说话的权利，解放后被选为全国人民代表大会代表，和国家领导人一年一次地讨论国家大事。象我这样的人，全国还有很多很多。邓拓你凭什么污蔑我党看不起群众，不接受群众的意见呢？
    邓拓，你所谓的“群众”究竟是什么样的“群众”？你的“群众”就是那些“杂家”，就是资产阶级分子、地主阶级分子，以及这些阶级的知识分子，就是右倾机会主义分子。你要我们相信这些家伙的所谓“智慧”，听这些所谓“群众”的“好”意见。这是些什么“智慧”呢？就是反党反社会主义的“智慧”，为右倾机会主义喊冤的“智慧”！你们是些什么“好意见”呢？就是要我们党“什么话都不要说”，“什么事情都不能做”，赶快下台“休息”的“好意见”！接受了这些所谓“智慧”、“好意见”，那不就是让右倾机会主义分子、牛鬼蛇神上台，资本主义复辟，整个中国就要改变颜色吗？
    我们同邓拓的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。是毛泽东思想领导还是修正主义掌权？问题就是明摆着的。我们在这场斗争中，要坚决保卫毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高举起，对准你们这伙牛鬼蛇神开火，不获胜，不收兵。
