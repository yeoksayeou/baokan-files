Title: Apologists for the Spiritual Aggression of American Imperialism

    In early 1960, Wu Han shamelessly praised the running dogs of the American-Chiang reactionaries, such as Mei Yi-qi and Jiang Tingfu, in a conversation with several comrades, acting as an apologist for the spiritual aggression of American imperialism.

    Wu Han went to great lengths to praise the attitude of a group of people headed by Mei Yi-qi, the former president of Qinghua University, towards students. He said, "The school administration's attitude towards students was different from that of the Kuomintang's Third Gendarmerie Regiment. Although they didn't love the students, they didn't sell them out much either." He also said, "Mei Yi-qi should be analyzed specifically." He repeatedly said, "Qinghua had walls, school guards, and its own armed forces, and was not controlled by the Kuomintang administrative authorities."

    This is a complete fabrication of history. Mei Yi-qi was a member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and a representative of the puppet National Assembly. The leadership group of the old Qinghua, headed by such a reactionary element, faithfully implemented the instructions of the Kuomintang reactionary regime. Mei Yi-qi once conspired with the reactionary government on how to effectively suppress the student movement and viciously provided the reactionary government with blacklists. In 1948, Mei Yi-qi claimed that he had "consulted more than ten times" with the reactionary government regarding the blacklist, and had "telegraphed Hu (Shi) to Zhu (the puppet Minister of Education, Zhu Jiahua) to forward to Weng (the puppet Executive Yuan President) and present to the President (Jiang Jieshi)" regarding this matter. Later, he "discussed in detail" with Chen Xueping, the head of the Kuomintang CC clique secret service, and others, and jointly planned the "August 19th" mass arrest. Under the instigation of Mei Yi-qi and others, the reactionaries plotted to arrest more than 200 people, including 59 Qinghua students. Clearly, Mei Yi-qi was a faithful running dog of the American-Chiang reactionaries and an insidious and cruel executioner in suppressing the student movement. What was Wu Han trying to achieve by deliberately exonerating him?

    As for the old Qinghua school guards, they could only be a part of the Kuomintang's reactionary armed forces. Wu Han's description of the old Qinghua school guards as "its own armed forces" that were "not controlled by the Kuomintang administrative authorities" is not only defending Mei Yi-qi, but also beautifying the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    In this conversation, Wu Han also repeatedly said that although the United States "established schools with the aim of aggression and poisoned some people, it also did some good things and cultivated a group of revolutionary cadres." It is truly absurd that American imperialism "cultivated a group of revolutionary cadres" for us! Before liberation, most of the graduates of the old Qinghua served the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Some of them, such as Hu Shi, Jiang Tingfu, and Mei Yi-qi, remained enemies of the people until their deaths, and some even betrayed their motherland and became American citizens. It is true that some students from the old Qinghua embarked on the revolutionary road. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, they broke through numerous obstacles and embarked on the revolutionary road of combining with workers and peasants and with revolutionary armed forces. This cannot be attributed to the old Qinghua at all. The old Qinghua was a school established by the United States with the Boxer Indemnity. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that the United States "participated in the Eight-Power Allied Forces to defeat China, forced the Boxer Indemnity, and used it to 'educate Chinese students,' engaging in spiritual aggression, which can also be regarded as a sign of 'friendship.'" But Wu Han beautified the spiritual aggression of American imperialism as "cultivating talents for China." This view is identical to that of former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson. Acheson said: "The United States has been deepening America's friendship with China... for example, using the Boxer Indemnity to educate Chinese students." Wu Han was still promoting Acheson's views in 1960. Isn't this the complete face of an American slave?

    In this conversation, Wu Han also attempted to rehabilitate Jiang Tingfu. He said, "Few Qinghua students held power in the Kuomintang," "Jiang Tingfu was just a bureaucrat," and "not a big official." Everyone knows that Jiang Tingfu served as the Chiang bandit gang's ambassador to the United States and representative to the United Nations. In 1950, Comrade Wu Xiuquan righteously and sternly denounced the crimes of American aggression against China at the United Nations. Jiang Tingfu, speaking fluent English, shamelessly tried to deny the crimes of his American masters and remained reactionary to the end, dying in the United States. Wu Han in the 1960s closed his eyes to the facts and tried to exonerate him. This was no accident. After graduating from university, Wu Han was promoted by Jiang Tingfu to become a teaching assistant at the old Qinghua, rising rapidly and becoming a professor a few years later. Wu Han was therefore grateful to Jiang and defended him.

    美帝国主义精神侵略的辩护士
    寇世琪　金丽华
    一九六○年初吴晗在对几位同志的谈话中，无耻地对美蒋反动派走卒梅贻琦、蒋廷黻之流歌功颂德，充当美帝国主义精神侵略的辩护士。
    吴晗竭力称颂以旧清华校长梅贻琦为首的一帮人对待学生的态度。他说：“学校行政对学生的态度与国民党的宪兵三团有区别。虽不是爱护学生，但出卖的也不多。”还说“对梅贻琦要具体分析”。他再三地说：“清华有围墙，有校卫队，自己有武装，不受国民党行政当局的控制。”
    这完全是对历史的捏造。梅贻琦是国民党中央执行委员和伪国大代表。以这样一个反动分子为首的旧清华的领导集团，是忠实地执行国民党反动政权的指令的。梅贻琦就曾和反动政府密谋如何有力地扑灭学生运动，恶毒地为反动政府提供黑名单。一九四八年，梅贻琦自称曾和反动政府就黑名单“会商达十余次”，并就此事“与胡（适）密电致朱（伪教育部长朱家骅）转翁（伪行政院长）并呈总统（蒋介石）”。后又与国民党CC派特务头子陈雪屏等“细商”，共同策划了“八一九”大逮捕。在梅贻琦等人的策动下，反动派阴谋逮捕二百多人，其中清华同学有五十九人。很清楚，梅贻琦是美蒋反动派的忠实走卒，是镇压学生运动的阴险残酷的刽子手。吴晗着意为他开脱罪责，这是为了什么？
    至于说到旧清华的校卫队，也只能是国民党的反动武装的一部分。吴晗把旧清华校卫队说成是“不受国民党行政当局的控制”的“自己的武装”，这就不仅是替梅贻琦辩护，而且也是美化国民党反动派。
    吴晗在这次谈话中还一再说，虽然美国“创办学校抱着侵略目的，毒害了一些人，但也办了些好事，培养了一批革命干部”。美帝国主义竟然给我们“培养了一批革命干部”，这真是天下奇谈！旧清华的毕业生，在解放前，多数是为大地主大资产阶级服务的人，其中一部分人象胡适、蒋廷黻、梅贻琦之流，则至死与人民为敌，还有个别人背叛祖国入了美国籍。旧清华确实也有一部分同学走上了革命道路，他们在党的培养、教育下，冲破了重重阻挠，走上与工农相结合，与革命武装相结合的革命道路。这根本不能算在旧清华的账上。旧清华是美国用庚子赔款办的学校。毛主席早就指出，美国“参加八国联军打败中国，迫出庚子赔款，又用之于‘教育中国学生’，从事精神侵略，也算一项‘友谊’的表示。”而吴晗却把美帝的精神侵略美化成“为中国培养人才”。这种观点与前美国国务卿艾奇逊的说法如出一辙。艾奇逊说：“美国一直在加深着美国对中国的友谊……例如用庚子赔款来教育中国学生。”吴晗在一九六○年还在宣扬艾奇逊的观点，这不是十足的美国奴才嘴脸吗？
    吴晗在这次谈话中还企图替蒋廷黻翻案。他说，“清华学生在国民党中当权的少”，“蒋廷黻只是个事务官”，“不是什么大官”。大家知道，蒋廷黻当过蒋匪帮驻美国大使和驻联合国代表。一九五○年伍修权同志到联合国义正辞严地控诉美国侵略中国的罪行，蒋廷黻操着满口英语恬不知耻地替美国主子抵赖，一直反动到底，死在美国。六十年代的吴晗却闭着眼睛不看事实，替他开脱罪责，这绝非偶然。吴晗在大学毕业以后靠蒋廷黻的提拔，当了旧清华的助教，青云直上，几年后作了教授。吴晗因此对蒋感恩戴德，为蒋辩护。
