    Deng Tuo, Don't Even Think About Slipping Away!
    If it’s a black line, it must be eliminated; if it’s a black gang, it must be smashed. We, the working class, have a responsibility to defend socialism and defend Mao Zedong Thought.
    Tian Fenglin, Political Instructor of the Delivery Section of the Hohhot Post and Telecommunications Bureau
    After reading the materials published in the newspaper regarding the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of the Deng Tuo and his gang, I am filled with extreme indignation. The anti-Party and anti-socialist black remarks made by Deng Tuo in "Yanshan Evening Talks" are completely in tune with the chorus sung by class enemies at home and abroad. They are exactly the same, and the maliciousness and cruelty of his tactics are even worse than those of previous anti-communist experts. Deng Tuo is indeed a leading general among a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and a ringleader in the black gang.

      If it’s a black line, it must be eliminated; if it’s a black gang, it must be smashed. We are the working class and have a responsibility to defend socialism and defend Mao Zedong Thought. We will never allow Deng Tuo to stir up trouble. We must resolutely overthrow him, resolutely open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and must stand at the forefront of the socialist cultural revolution.

    Deng Tuo has launched countless poisonous arrows at the Party, maliciously scolding our Party for "bragging," "fanaticism," and speaking "great empty words," suffering from "amnesia," and being "untrustworthy," and slandering our socialist construction as "finished." This is complete nonsense. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, China's industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry are developing rapidly. Daqing has emerged in industry, Dazhai has emerged in agriculture, China is self-sufficient in oil, and one atomic bomb after another has been exploded. It seems that these achievements have frightened Deng Tuo and his ilk. They stand with imperialist and revisionist elements and curse us. We must shout loudly at Deng Tuo and his ilk: Your purpose in slandering our Party is to overthrow our Party and realize capitalist restoration. Your sinister attempts will never succeed.

    In the old society, I suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. The painful past is still fresh in my memory, and the life of being worse than cattle and horses is still vivid in my mind. In 1941, when I was only six or seven years old, I followed my parents begging along the streets to Hohhot. My father worked as a long-term laborer, my mother did needlework, and I carried a patched burlap sack through the streets and alleys picking up coal cinders. Even so, our whole family's desperate labor could not feed the family. After liberation, the Communist Party came, and we were liberated. The Communist Party is our great savior. Deng Tuo wants us to distrust the Communist Party. Isn't his malicious intention very clear?

    Deng Tuo arrogantly clamored for our Party to quickly step down to "rest," "say nothing," "do nothing," and listen to the "guidance" of Deng Tuo and his gang. We want to solemnly tell Deng Tuo: The workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not be confused by you. It is absolutely impossible to make us disobey the Party. The era of our being exploited and oppressed is gone forever. We have truly become the masters of the new society. We know how to be good masters of this country. We know that to be good masters of our proletariat's home, we must listen to the Party and rely on the Party's leadership; we must not relax class struggle and eliminate all open or hidden class enemies. To tell the Party to "step down" and listen to your "guidance" is a "pipe dream" you are having.

    Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist face has been completely exposed. Regardless of whether he retreats to advance or defends to attack, he should not even think about slipping away.

    邓拓，休想溜过去！
    是黑线就要搞掉，是黑帮就要打垮。我们工人阶级，有责任捍卫社会主义，捍卫毛泽东思想
    呼和浩特邮电局投递科政治指导员　田凤林
    我看了报上刊登的有关邓拓等一伙黑帮的反党反社会主义的材料后，万分愤慨。邓拓在《燕山夜话》中说的反党反社会主义的黑话，和国内外阶级敌人唱的完全是一个调子，如出一辙，其性质之恶毒，手腕之毒辣，比起以往的反共专家们都有过之而无不及。邓拓不愧为一小撮反党反社会主义分子中的一员主将，黑帮中的一个头目。
      是黑线就要搞掉，是黑帮就要打垮。我们是工人阶级，有责任捍卫社会主义、捍卫毛泽东思想。我们决不允许邓拓兴风作浪，一定要坚决把他打倒，坚决向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，而且一定要站在社会主义文化大革命的前列。
    邓拓向党发出了无数支毒箭，恶毒地骂我们党“吹牛皮”“狂热”，说“伟大的空话”，害了“健忘症”，“不堪信任”，污蔑我们的社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了。这完全是胡说八道。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国的工农牧业正在一日千里地发展，工业上出现了大庆，农业上出现了大寨，我国的石油自给了，原子弹一颗接一颗地爆炸了，想来是这些成就把邓拓之流吓坏了，他们和帝国主义、修正主义分子站在一起对我们破口大骂了。我们要向邓拓之流大喝一声：你们污蔑我们党的目的，是想推翻我们党，实现资本主义复辟。你们的罪恶企图是永远也不会得逞的。
    我在旧社会受尽了剥削和压迫。苦难的过去，我还记忆犹新，牛马不如的生活，还历历在目。一九四一年，我才六七岁，就跟着父母沿街乞讨来到了呼和浩特市，父亲揽长工，母亲做针线，我背了一个补了又补的麻袋走街串巷拣煤渣。就这样，我们全家拼死拼活地劳动也糊不住一家人的口。解放后，共产党来了，我们才翻了身。共产党是我们的大救星，邓拓要我们不信任共产党，其恶毒居心不是很清楚的吗？
    邓拓狂妄地叫喊要我们党赶快下台“休息”，“什么话都不要说”，“什么事情都不能做”，一切听从邓拓你们这伙人的“指导”。我们要正告邓拓：用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵，是不会被你迷惑住的，要想让我们不听党的话，是万万办不到的。我们受剥削受压迫的时代已经一去不复返了，我们真正当了新社会的主人翁。我们懂得怎样当好这个家，我们懂得要当好我们无产阶级的家，就要听党的话，靠党的领导；就要不放松阶级斗争，消灭一切公开的或暗藏的阶级敌人。叫党“下台”，听你们来“指导”，这是你们做的“白日梦”。
    邓拓反党反社会主义的面貌已经彻底暴露。不管他以退为进，还是以守为攻，都休想溜过去。
