    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th - As Indonesia's economic situation deteriorated sharply and teetered on the brink of collapse after the right-wing generals' clique seized state power, the Japanese Sato government seized the opportunity to step up economic penetration.
    It is reported that Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia, Shizuo Saito, held talks with Suharto on April 28. Saito told Suharto that the Japanese government was willing to "help" Indonesia "stabilize" its economy. According to the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* on May 2, the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently decided to provide the Indonesian government with another $40 million in "emergency aid," and hypocritically stated that the purpose of this "aid" was to "rebuild" the Indonesian economy.
    As previously reported, the Japanese government provided the Indonesian right-wing forces with $2.5 million in "emergency aid" after they seized state power. According to the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, the "emergency aid" determined by the Japanese Foreign Ministry this time is in the form of a loan to provide Indonesia with "necessary materials," and Indonesia should repay the principal and interest within five years after the Japanese government provides the loan.
    The newspaper also said that the Japanese Foreign Ministry is preparing to use the funds of the Export-Import Bank of Japan to provide the Indonesian right-wing military clique with fertilizers, cotton cloth, auto parts, and ships that it "urgently needs."
    The report said that the Foreign Ministry has also decided to provide the Indonesian right-wing military group with formal loans depending on the progress of Indonesia's economy in the future.

    佐藤政府向印尼加紧经济渗透
    决定再给右派政权四千万美元“紧急援助”
    新华社东京四日电　在印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取国家政权后，印度尼西亚经济情况急剧恶化，正濒于崩溃的时候，日本佐藤政府乘虚而入，加紧进行经济渗透。
    据报道，日本驻印度尼西亚大使斋藤镇男四月二十八日同苏哈托举行会谈，斋藤向苏哈托表示，日本政府愿意“帮助”印度尼西亚“稳定”经济。据《日本经济新闻》五月二日透露，日本外务省（外交部）最近确定再次给予印度尼西亚政府以四千万美元的“紧急援助”，并且假惺惺的表示这项“援助”的目的是为“重建”印度尼西亚经济。
    前已报道，日本政府在印度尼西亚右派势力夺取国家政权后，曾向它提供了二百五十万美元的“紧急援助”。据《日本经济新闻》报道，日本外务省这次确定的
  “紧急援助”是以贷款的形式向印度尼西亚提供“必要的物资”，而印度尼西亚应于日本政府提供贷款后的五年内还本付息。
    这家报纸还说，日本外务省准备使用日本输出入银行的资金向印度尼西亚提供它“紧急需要”的肥料、棉布、汽车零件和船舶等。
    报道说，外务省还决定，看今后印度尼西亚经济的进展情况，将向印度尼西亚右派军人集团提供正式贷款。
