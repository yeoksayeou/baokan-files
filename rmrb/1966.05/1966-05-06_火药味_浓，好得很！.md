    Strong "Gunpowder Smell" is Excellent!
    Liberation Army Navy, Department of a certain unit  Chen Shixin
    For more than a decade, a counter-Party and anti-socialist black line has consistently existed in the literary and art circles. They have cooperated with the political struggles of the bourgeoisie and modern revisionism, stirring up wave after wave of black winds. One of these currents is the so-called anti-"gunpowder smell" theory. Echoing international imperialism and revisionism, they have slandered our literary and artistic works depicting class struggle, people's war, and the people's army as having "too rough lines," "monotonous colors," "narrow subject matter," and "making people so tense they can't breathe." There are many ways of saying it, but the conclusion is one: the "gunpowder smell" is too strong. There are many tunes, but the aim is one: to make the revolutionary people lay down their guns. In fact, what they oppose is only the revolutionary "gunpowder smell." As for the bourgeoisie's "gunpowder smell," they not only do not oppose it, but like it very much.
      "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." Therefore, our army, personally created and led by Chairman Mao and composed of workers and peasants, has always been a thorn in the side of reactionaries at home and abroad. They are constantly trying to undermine and disintegrate the fighting power of this people's army. The anti-"gunpowder smell" theory is a detachment of the enemy on the literary and artistic front.
    In order to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, we must firmly grasp the gun. Our literary and artistic works should vigorously promote Chairman Mao's thought on people's war, educate the people to hold their guns tightly, and use revolutionary war to eliminate counter-revolutionary war. The enemy opposes our "gunpowder smell," which proves that we are doing the right thing. We must firmly grasp the revolutionary pen and write more and better literary and artistic works with a strong revolutionary "gunpowder smell." Let us shout loudly: A strong "gunpowder smell" is excellent!

    “火药味”浓，好得很！
    解放军海军某部  陈诗信
    十几年来，文艺界一直存在着一条反党反社会主义的黑线。他们配合资产阶级和现代修正主义的政治斗争，刮起了一阵阵黑风。其中的一股，就是所谓反“火药味”论。他们和国际上的帝国主义、修正主义遥相呼应，一唱一和，污蔑我们描写阶级斗争、人民战争、人民军队的文艺作品“线条太粗”、
  “色彩单调”、“题材狭窄”、“使人紧张得透不过气来”。说法很多，结论一个：“火药味”太重了。调调很多，目的一个：就是要革命的人民放下枪杆子。其实，他们反对的只是革命的“火药味”，对于资产阶级的“火药味”，他们不仅不反对，而且喜欢得很。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”因此，我们这支由毛主席亲手缔造和领导的工人、农民的武装，一直是国内外反动派的眼中钉、肉中刺。他们无时无刻不是在想方设法破坏和瓦解这支人民军队的战斗力。反“火药味”论，就是敌人在文艺战线上的一支别动队。
    为了把社会主义革命进行到底，我们要紧握枪杆子。我们的文艺作品，应当大力宣传毛主席的人民战争的思想，教育人民握紧枪杆子，用革命的战争来消灭反革命的战争。敌人反对我们的“火药味”，这正好证明我们做对了。我们要紧握革命的笔杆子，写出更多更好的有浓浓的革命“火药味”的文艺作品。让我们高呼：“火药味”浓，好得很！
