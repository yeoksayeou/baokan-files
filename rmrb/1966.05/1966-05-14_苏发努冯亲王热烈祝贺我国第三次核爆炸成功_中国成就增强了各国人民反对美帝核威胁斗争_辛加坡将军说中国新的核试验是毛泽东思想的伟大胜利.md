    Xinhua News Agency, 13th.

The full text of the telegram is as follows:
To His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai, State Council of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:
    We were extremely pleased to learn that China successfully conducted its third nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials on the afternoon of May 9, 1966. This is a great achievement made by Chinese workers, scientific workers, and 650 million Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong in the field of scientific research and in the cause of defending China.
    The great victory of the successful third nuclear explosion test has further strengthened China's national defense strength, made important contributions to defending the socialist camp, enhancing the strength of national liberation movements in the world, and opposing the nuclear threat of US imperialism.
    On this occasion, on behalf of the Lao people, I would like to wish the fraternal Chinese people more great victories in the cause of national construction, in the field of scientific research, and in the cause of consolidating national defense, defending the motherland, and defending world peace.
Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao Tripartite National Unity Government, May 10, 1966, at Sam Neua.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 12th. General Singapo, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, congratulated the Chinese Economic and Cultural Delegation to Laos on China's successful third nuclear test on the 11th. He said that this great victory belongs not only to the Chinese people, but also to the oppressed and exploited people all over the world, and also to the Lao people. The Lao people are overjoyed by this new victory.
    General Singapo said that the Lao people warmly congratulate the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chinese workers, scientific and technical personnel, and 650 million Chinese people with unparalleled excitement on the successful nuclear test under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great Chairman Mao Zedong, and wish the Chinese people new and greater victories.
    General Singapo also said that this new major achievement made by the Chinese people is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. China's nuclear tests and the development of nuclear weapons are aimed at opposing US imperialism's nuclear monopoly, nuclear blackmail, and nuclear threat, and opposing US imperialism's disruption and suppression of the revolutionary struggles of oppressed people and oppressed nations around the world. Therefore, US imperialism has tried its best to prevent revolutionary China from mastering nuclear weapons. However, China has completely shattered the US nuclear monopoly.
    He said that the success of this nuclear test has powerfully strengthened China's national defense strength and the forces for defending world peace, and once again greatly enhanced the strength of the national liberation movement and encouraged the people of all countries in the world, especially the Lao people, to fight against US imperialism.
    General Singapo warmly praised and firmly supported the Chinese government's consistent position of China not being the first to use nuclear weapons.
    He said that in the current world revolutionary situation, as long as the people of all countries in the world further unite and resolutely fight, they can completely defeat US imperialism.

    苏发努冯亲王热烈祝贺我国第三次核爆炸成功
    中国成就增强了各国人民反对美帝核威胁斗争
    辛加坡将军说中国新的核试验是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    新华社十三日讯　周恩来总理收到了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方面民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王热烈祝贺我国成功地进行了第三次核试验的电报。电报全文如下：北京中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来阁下：
    当获悉中国在一九六六年五月九日下午第三次成功地试验了含有热核材料的核爆炸消息后，我们感到无比的高兴。这是中国工人、科学工作者和六亿五千万中国人民，在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在科学研究领域中和在保卫中国事业中所取得的一项巨大成就。
    第三次核爆炸试验成功的巨大胜利，进一步加强了中国的国防力量，对保卫社会主义阵营，增强世界上民族解放运动的力量和反对美帝国主义的核威胁，做出了重要的贡献。
    值此机会，我谨代表老挝人民祝兄弟的中国人民在建设国家事业中，在科学研究领域中，在巩固国防、保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的事业中取得更多的重大胜利。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席老挝三方面民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王一九六六年五月十日于桑怒
    新华社康开十二日电　老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表辛加坡将军十一日向中国驻老挝经济文化代表团祝贺中国第三次核试验成功。他说，这个伟大的胜利不仅是属于中国人民，也是属于全世界被压迫和被剥削人民的，也是属于老挝人民的。老挝人民为这一新的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。
    辛加坡将军说，老挝人民以无比兴奋的心情热烈祝贺中国人民解放军、中国工人和科学技术人员以及六亿五千万中国人民，在伟大的中国共产党和伟大的毛泽东主席的领导下，成功地进行了这次核试验，并预祝中国人民取得更新更大的胜利。
    辛加坡将军又说，中国人民取得的这一新的重大成就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。中国进行核试验、发展核武器，是为了反对美帝国主义的核垄断、核讹诈和核威胁，反对美帝国主义破坏和镇压全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。因此美帝国主义竭力阻止革命的中国掌握核武器。但是，中国已彻底粉碎了美国的核垄断。
    他说，这次核试验的成功，有力地加强了中国的国防力量和保卫世界和平的力量，又一次大大地增强了民族解放运动的力量和鼓舞了全世界各国人民特别是老挝人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    辛加坡将军热烈赞扬和坚决支持中国政府一贯表明的中国不首先使用核武器的立场。
    他说，在当前世界革命的形势下，只要全世界各国人民进一步团结起来，坚决地进行斗争，就可以彻底打败美帝国主义。
