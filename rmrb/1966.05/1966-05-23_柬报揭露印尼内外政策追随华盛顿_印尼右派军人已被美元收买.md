    Phnom Penh, May 21 (Xinhua) - The "Cambodge Soir" published a commentary on the 21st, stating that Indonesia's "domestic and foreign policies, if not dictated by Washington, are at least blindly following Washington."

    The commentary said: "It has been confirmed that the military group currently ruling Indonesia is requesting and will receive aid from certain imperialist countries, especially the United States."

    The commentary said: "An official Indonesian delegation is currently in the United States, and Rusk and McNamara have already expressed their approval of restoring aid to Jakarta. Plans are also underway to establish an 'international consortium' to study the issue of providing funds for Indonesia to repay its foreign debt."

    Referring to the economic situation in Indonesia, the commentary said that industrial and agricultural enterprises are once again falling into the hands of foreign capital and monopoly capitalist groups, Indonesia's currency is propped up by foreign banks, and military officers have also been bought off by US dollars.
