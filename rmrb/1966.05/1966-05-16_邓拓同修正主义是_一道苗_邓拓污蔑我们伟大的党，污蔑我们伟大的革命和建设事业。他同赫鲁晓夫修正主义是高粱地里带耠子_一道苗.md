    Deng Tuo's Revisionism is "A Single Sprout"
    Deng Tuo Slanders Our Great Party, Slanders Our Great Revolutionary and Construction Undertaking. He and Khrushchev's Revisionism are Like a Hoe in a Sorghum Field - A Single Sprout
    Li Molin, Representative to the National People's Congress, Deputy Director of the Si Ji Qing Commune, Beijing
    After listening to Deng Tuo's vicious anti-Party and anti-socialist black words, I am extremely indignant. This wolf in human skin dares to do such a thing, it's too crazy! We will never allow him to slander our great Party, nor will we allow him to slander our great revolutionary and construction undertaking.
    Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, holding high the red flag of the General Line, we have overcome numerous difficulties and achieved great accomplishments. People all over the world are happy for us. Deng Tuo, however, is as uncomfortable as if he had tuberculosis, scolding us for "bragging" and "talking big." What are the facts? Not to mention anything far away, let’s just take our Si Ji Qing as an example. Since the Great Leap Forward, we have gradually realized water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification, with production increasing year after year and life getting better year after year. In the past, wheat yielded forty or fifty jin per mu, but now the average yield is four to five hundred jin per mu. Is this also "bragging"? Si Ji Qing produces vegetables to supply the needs of the capital. Regardless of the cold or heat, every day fresh vegetables are sent to the city. Where has this ever happened before? In the past, when there were emperors, there was a saying, "Presenting melons on the 28th of the fourth month," meaning that melons only came down on the 28th day of the fourth lunar month, and they were first "presented" to the emperor. Now, we "present melons" every day—cucumbers, eggplants, green peppers, tomatoes, evergreen in all seasons, continuous every day, fully satisfying the needs of the people of the capital. I ask Deng Tuo, don't you eat these grains and vegetables that we produce? You eat human food but don't speak human words, with the heart of a wolf and the guts of a dog, black-hearted. The grain and vegetables you eat every day are clearly the results of the Great Leap Forward, but you turn around and viciously slander the Great Leap Forward, telling lies against your conscience!
    Deng Tuo slanders our Party for not cherishing the labor force, asking our Party to learn "ruling experience" from the feudal ruling class. These words not only nakedly expose Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist ugly face, but also nakedly expose his purpose to drag us back to the evil capitalist and feudalist society, and restore capitalism and feudalism in our country. These words can only fool two- or three-year-old children, you can't fool me with that. My hometown is Baiyangdian. I escaped famine at the age of thirteen, worked as an apprentice, begged for food, and carried long-term work until liberation. How did the landlords and capitalists "cherish" us "labor forces"? Worse than a dog! They fed dogs with steamed buns and dumplings, but those who carried long-term work ate bran and wild herbs, and sometimes even had to pay for meals while carrying long-term work. They used to hit, scold, freeze, starve, insult, and trample on us, using every means. I have suffered all these crimes, and I have personally seen countless class brothers being tortured to death! If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, my bones would have rotted long ago! Deng Tuo said that the ruling class in the old society knew how to "cherish the labor force," who is he speaking for? Isn't it clear?
    The "stinking beggars" of the past have now become the masters of the country; the "stinking peasants" of the past have now become fragrant peasants. Chairman Mao treats us like golden nuggets, what a big change! Chairman Mao calls on us to be self-reliant, strive for strength, and quickly change the face of poverty and blankness. This is the greatest care and love for us, and it is a fundamental plan related to the future and destiny of our children and grandchildren. Isn't it natural for us to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, be self-reliant, build the motherland, and support the world revolution? Deng Tuo suddenly pretended to sympathize with us, slandering the Party for not cherishing the labor force. This is completely speaking from the standpoint of the class enemy, singing the same tune as imperialism and modern revisionism, vainly attempting to alienate us from the Party. Tell you, Deng Tuo, it can't be done! The more you slander, the more we will do better and do well. Those who "break their heads and bleed" in the face of the facts are not us, but imperialism, modern revisionism, all reactionaries, and monsters and demons!
    What is particularly noteworthy is that Deng Tuo has been waving the banner of a Party member, stealing important leading positions in the Party, and doing this kind of dirty thing. He is the agent of imperialism, modern revisionism, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within our Party, and a spy hidden within our Party. He and the Khrushchev revisionists are like a hoe in a sorghum field - a single sprout. We must thoroughly expose the ugly face of this spy, fight him to the end, and never stop until we win a complete victory!

    邓拓同修正主义是“一道苗”
    邓拓污蔑我们伟大的党，污蔑我们伟大的革命和建设事业。他同赫鲁晓夫修正主义是高粱地里带耠子——一道苗
    全国人民代表大会代表、北京四季青公社副主任  李墨林
    听了邓拓那些恶毒的反党反社会主义的黑话，我非常愤恨。这个披着人皮的恶狼，竟敢干出这种勾当，太疯狂了！我们决不容许他污蔑我们伟大的党，决不容许他污蔑我们伟大的革命和建设事业。
    我们在党和毛主席的领导下，高举总路线的红旗，战胜了重重困难，取得了伟大成就，全世界的人民都为我们高兴。邓拓却象?了肺尖子一样难受，骂我们是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”。事实是怎么样呢？远的不说，就拿我们四季青来说吧，自从大跃进以来，我们逐步实现了水利化、机械化、电气化，生产年年都有提高，生活一年比一年好。过去小麦每亩收四五十斤，现在每亩平均达到四、五百斤，这也是“吹牛皮”吗？四季青生产蔬菜，供应首都需要，不管五冬六夏，不管多冷多热，每天都往城里上鲜菜，这种事过去哪儿有过？早先有皇帝的时候，有句俗话：“四月二十八进瓜”，是说阴历四月二十八瓜才下来，先给皇帝“进”上去。现在我们天天“进瓜”，黄瓜、茄子、青椒、西红柿，四季常青，天天不断，充分满足首都人民的需要。我问邓拓，难道你就不吃我们生产的这些粮食和蔬菜吗？你吃人饭不说人话，狼心狗肺黑心肠。你每天吃的粮和菜，明明是大跃进的成果，你却反过来恶毒地污蔑大跃进，昧着良心说瞎话！
    邓拓污蔑我们党不爱护劳动力，要我们党向封建统治阶级学习“统治经验”，这些话不仅赤裸裸地暴露了邓拓的反党反社会主义的丑恶面目，也赤裸裸地暴露了他的目的是要把我们拉回到万恶的资本主义和封建主义社会，在我国复辟资本主义和封建主义。这些话只能糊弄两三岁的小孩，跟我说可蒙不过去。我老家是白洋淀。我十三岁就逃荒出来，当学徒，要饭，扛长活，一直扛到解放。地主、资本家是怎样“爱惜”我们这些“劳动力”的呢？连一条狗都不如！他们喂狗用饽饽、馒头，扛长活的却吃糠咽菜，有时给他扛长活，吃饭还倒找钱。他们对我们，打、骂、冻、饿、侮辱、糟踏，什么都使得出来。这些罪我全受过，亲眼看见不知多少阶级兄弟被折磨死了！要不是共产党、毛主席来，我的骨头也早烂了！邓拓说旧社会的统治阶级知道“爱护劳动力”，这是在替谁说话，还不明白吗？
    过去的“臭要饭的”，现在成了国家的主人；过去的“臭农民”，现在成了香农民。毛主席拿我们当金疙瘩，这是多大的变化！毛主席号召我们自力更生，奋发图强，迅速改变一穷二白的面貌，这是对我们的最大关怀和爱护，是关系到我们子孙万代的前途和命运的根本大计。我们积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，自力更生，建设祖国，支援世界革命，不是很自然的事吗？邓拓忽然装作同情我们的样子，诬蔑党不爱护劳动力，这完全是站在阶级敌人的立场上说话，和帝国主义、现代修正主义唱一个调调，妄想离间我们和党的血肉关系。告诉你，邓拓，办不到！你越污蔑，我们越要干得棒，干得好。在事实面前“碰得头破血流”的，不是我们，而是帝国主义、现代修正主义、一切反动派和牛鬼蛇神！
    特别值得注意的是，邓拓一直打着党员的招牌，窃踞着党的重要领导岗位，干的却是这种肮脏的勾当。他是帝国主义、现代修正主义和地富反坏右在我们党内的代理人，是隐藏在我们党内的奸细。他和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是高粱地里带耠子——一道苗。我们一定要彻底揭穿这个奸细的丑恶嘴脸，跟他斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
