    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 21st: Under the instigation of the Indonesian authorities, a group of thugs staged an anti-China demonstration in Kuala Simpang, Aceh Province, Sumatra, on May 8th.  R. Arsa, Commander of the First Military Region of Indonesia, addressed the demonstrating thugs, inciting them to oppose China and openly clamoring for the expulsion of Overseas Chinese.

    The thugs participating in this anti-China activity included members of the reactionary organization "Indonesian University Students Action Union" ("KAMI") in Kuala Simpang City, and members of "KAMI" and "Indonesian Youth Students Action Union" ("KABI") in Langsa City.

    According to a Chinese-language newspaper run by the Armed Forces in the Aceh region: "This demonstration was divided into two steps. The first step was to distribute leaflets to shops owned by citizens of the People's Republic of China, demanding that all citizens of the People's Republic of China leave Indonesia quickly. The second step was for 'KABI' and 'KAMI' to arrest the heads of citizens of the People's Republic of China (referring to leaders of Overseas Chinese community organizations – Editor's Note), and then hand them directly to Brigadier General R. Arsa, Commander of the First Military Region, for disposal."

    R. Arsa addressed this group of thugs in the Youth Square of Kuala Simpang, expressing "extreme understanding of the 'KABI' members' sacred intention to demand that citizens of the People's Republic of China leave this area quickly." He threatened the Overseas Chinese, saying: "If you from mainland China really want to be enemies with Indonesia, then please leave Indonesia immediately."

    On May 8th, "KAMI" and "KABI" thugs forcibly paraded more than 20 directors of the Chinese General Association of Langsa City and eight directors of the Chinese General Association of Kuala Simpang City through the streets, wantonly insulting them.

    On May 9th, the Commander of the 14th Military Region in South and Southeast Sulawesi openly issued a decision, ordering the deprivation of the right of Overseas Chinese to dispose of their property. The decision falsely accused China of engaging in "subversive and counter-revolutionary acts" and "prohibited Overseas Chinese from transferring personal or collective and limited liability company property to Indonesian citizens or other foreign citizens."

    印尼当局又指使暴徒举行反华示威
    右派军事头目煽动暴徒反华并叫嚷要驱逐华侨
    第十四军区司令悍然下令剥夺华侨处理自己财产的权利
    据新华社二十一日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚当局的指使下，一批暴徒五月八日在苏门答腊亚齐省瓜拉新邦市举行了一次反华示威。印度尼西亚第一军区司令儒阿尔萨对示威的暴徒发表讲话，煽动他们反华，并公然叫嚷要驱逐华侨。
    参加这次反华活动的暴徒包括瓜拉新邦市的反动组织“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”（“卡米”）的成员和冷沙市的“卡米”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”（“卡比”）的成员。
    据亚齐地区武装部队所办的华文报纸报道：“此次示威行动分为两个步骤，第一步向中华人民共和国籍公民之商店分发传单，要全体中华人民共和国籍公民迅速离开印尼。第二步是由‘卡比’及‘卡米’逮捕中华人民共和国籍公民之首脑（指华侨社团领导人——编者按），然后直接交与第一军区司令儒阿尔萨准将发落。”
    儒阿尔萨在瓜拉新邦市青年广场对这批暴徒发表讲话，表示“极为了解‘卡比’成员对要求中华人民共和国籍公民迅速离开本区的神圣之意”。他威胁华侨说：“如果来自中国大陆的你们确实想同印尼为敌，那末，就请你们马上离开印尼。”
    在五月八日这一天，“卡米”、“卡比”暴徒把冷沙市中华总会理事二十多名和瓜拉新邦市中华总会理事八名，强押着沿街游行，肆意侮辱。
    在南和东南苏拉威西的第十四军区司令五月九日公然颁布决定书，下令剥夺华侨处理他们的财产的权利。决定书指名诬蔑中国进行“颠覆和反革命行为”，“禁止华侨把个人或集体、有限公司的财产转移给印度尼西亚籍公民或其他外籍公民的做法”。
