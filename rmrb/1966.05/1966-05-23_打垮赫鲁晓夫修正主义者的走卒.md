    Defeat the Running Dogs of Khrushchev's Revisionism
    In the anti-American demonstration in Moscow, I was suppressed and persecuted by the revisionist clique, and I saw through their vicious intentions and reactionary nature. The "Three-Family Village" gang chimed in with them, colluding from within and without, and became loyal running dogs of Khrushchev's revisionism.

    The black goods peddled by the "Three-Family Village" black shop are exactly the same as the black goods of Khrushchev's revisionists. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are jackals of the same lair as Khrushchev's revisionists. Not only do they have the same tune and the same language, but they also cooperate with each other in a planned way in their actions. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and defeat the running dogs of Khrushchev's revisionism.
    In the anti-American demonstration of Asian and African students in Moscow on March 4 last year, I was brutally suppressed and persecuted by the Soviet revisionist clique. Later, our dear Party brought me back to the motherland. The events of a year ago are still fresh in my memory. When I heard of the crimes of the "Three-Family Village" gang viciously attacking our great Party and Chairman Mao, and arrogantly attempting to restore capitalism in our country, old and new hatreds surged into my heart, and the fire of anger exploded in my chest. We want to tell Deng Tuo and other small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements that your delusion to turn red China into black China is a pipe dream. The people of our country wholeheartedly love the Party Central Committee headed by our great leader Chairman Mao. We must thoroughly defeat you, a group of demons and monsters, and resolutely carry out this great struggle related to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!
    Khrushchev's revisionists slandered our leader Chairman Mao's scientific conclusion that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" as "absurd" and "dogmatic theory," while Deng Tuo and his ilk slandered this conclusion as "great empty talk" and "clichés."
    Khrushchev's revisionists cursed our Party as "despotic" and "dictatorial," while Deng Tuo and his ilk cursed our Party as "aggressive" and "hegemonic."
    Khrushchev's revisionists were bent on subverting the leadership of our Party, and described the right-leaning opportunists in our Party as their "good friends," while Deng Tuo and his ilk everywhere cried injustice for the right-leaning opportunists who had been removed from office, praised their anti-Party "backbone," clamored for our Party to step down and "rest," and encouraged the right-leaning opportunists to make a comeback.
    Khrushchev's revisionists attacked our country's socialist construction's General Line and the Great Leap Forward as "big talk," "adventurous plans," and "voluntarism," while Deng Tuo and his ilk scolded us for "bragging," "talking big," and acting recklessly based on the "role of psychological elements" of Machism.
    Khrushchev's revisionists slandered our General Line and Great Leap Forward as having "failed" and "collapsed"; Deng Tuo said that we had "the possessions of a single egg," and that they were "all destroyed." Khrushchev's revisionists slandered us as "drinking clear water soup from a big pot," while Deng Tuo said "plain boiled water is the best drink," and so on.
    Look, how congenial is the smell of Deng Tuo and this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements with that of Khrushchev's revisionists! How similar are their ugly faces! How consistent are their tunes! They chime in with each other, collude from within and without, and are truly jackals of the same lair.
    This group of domestic and foreign reactionaries is completely consistent in their actions of attacking our great country and great Party. Around 1961, imperialism, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries stirred up a rampant anti-China chorus. In October 1961, Soviet revisionists held the infamous 22nd Congress. Domestically, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists took advantage of our temporary economic difficulties to fan the flames, stir up trouble, and妄想to overthrow the leadership of our Party and subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was in this situation that Deng Tuo and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, believing that the time had come, came out one after another, shooting a large number of poisonous arrows to pave the way for capitalist restoration. They were completely loyal running dogs of Khrushchev's revisionists!
    Deng Tuo, the big boss of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, not only attacked our great Party together with domestic and foreign reactionaries, but also tried his best to advocate learning from the Khrushchev revisionist group, saying that it is necessary to "learn" from and "unite" with countries that are "stronger than oneself," and slandered that "if you kick the teacher away, then you will not learn anything." What kind of stuff is this gang of Deng Tuo, and what path do they want to take? Isn't it very clear? They are thorough revisionists, and they are taking the black path of revisionism. If we do not overthrow this small handful of running dogs of Khrushchev's revisionism, what will our great country become? The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat tells us that we must firmly remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and never forget class struggle. Only by thoroughly defeating the frenzied attacks of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements can we consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that our country will never change color!
    Deng Tuo, this anti-Party element, viciously attacked our dictatorship of the proletariat as "hegemony" and asked us to learn the so-called "benevolent rule" of modern revisionists. What kind of stuff is their "benevolent rule"? When I was in Moscow, I and the students from our country and other Asian, African, and Latin American countries conducted an anti-American demonstration in front of the American Embassy, and I experienced the so-called "benevolent rule" of Khrushchev's revisionists. More than 700 Soviet military police carried out a bloody suppression of our foreign students who were demonstrating against the United States with bare hands, causing a bloody tragedy in which more than 130 people were injured. This is their "benevolent rule"; the Soviet revisionist authorities ordered that injured students were not allowed to enter the hospital, and those who were admitted were driven out, and those who could not be driven away were severely tortured or sent to "mental hospitals." This is their "benevolent government." Obviously, the "benevolent rule" praised by Deng Tuo and his ilk is precisely the "hegemony" that is an absolute "hegemony" towards revolutionary people, and precisely a bloody fascist rule. We want to tell the "Three-Family Village" black gang that your attempt to restore the bourgeois dictatorship in our country will not succeed. We will not only defeat you, a group of running dogs of modern revisionists, but also implement the dictatorship of the proletariat against you, using your own methods to treat you in the same way.
    Deng Tuo, this anti-socialist element, viciously slandered our socialist construction cause and asked us to "learn" from the Soviet revisionists, saying that otherwise, the difficulties would "increase day by day." This is completely nonsense. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding high the great red banner of the General Line and implementing the policy of self-reliance, we have achieved extremely great results. This is a fact that is obvious to all and cannot be denied by anyone. Deng Tuo and his ilk妄想to restore capitalism in our country, and they dream of implementing the revisionist exploitation rule like the Soviet Union. We have seen with our own eyes that the privileged class in the Soviet Union cruelly exploits the broad masses of workers and peasants. They take thousands or even tens of thousands of rubles every month and live a corrupt and decadent life, while the living standards of the broad masses of workers and peasants are very low. Some workers only earn thirty-six rubles a month, and some workers have to work twelve to sixteen hours a day to barely maintain the lowest standard of living. We are resolutely opposed to such a path. Deng Tuo and his ilk妄想want us to go backwards, which is fundamentally impossible. We are determined to take the socialist road, and whoever wants to stop the wheel of history from moving forward, we will smash them to pieces.
    Deng Tuo and this group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements adopted the means of "peaceful evolution" and tried their best to spread bourgeois ideas and lifestyles, and asked us to "learn" from the Soviet revisionists in this regard as well. Their real purpose is to use "knowledge," "interests," etc. as a cover, to subvert the entire dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism, starting from corroding "one-third of people's lives." We know that the Soviet Union under the rule of modern revisionists is precisely the decadent society promoted by Deng Tuo. There, it is completely "money" first and "I" in command. In education, they are engaged in bourgeois education that is divorced from proletarian politics and divorced from productive labor; in literature and art, they are engaged in old antiques from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women, vigorously promoting the American lifestyle, so that high hairstyles, stiletto heels, black light dances, alcoholism, etc. are rampant everywhere. Soviet revisionists used these messy things to corrupt the broad masses of young people and cultivate successors of the bourgeoisie. Deng Tuo and his ilk attempted to take the same measures to dissolve the broad revolutionary cadres and young students in order to recruit troops and buy horses for the "Three-Family Village" group. We angrily accuse Deng Tuo and other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements of this criminal act. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse illuminating the road of progress for the people of our country and the revolutionary people of the world. Whoever wants to abolish Mao Zedong Thought, whoever wants to corrupt our souls, we will resolutely fight him to the end!
    Now, the eyes of the people of the whole country and the whole world are watching our great Party, and the hearts of the people of the whole country and the whole world yearn for our great leader Chairman Mao. When abroad, many revolutionary Soviet people and friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America often expressed to us: "I earnestly hope that China will achieve great success," and "hope is pinned on Comrade Mao Zedong." All revolutionary people understand that without Mao Zedong Thought, there can be no socialism and communism at all, and it is impossible to achieve the victory of the proletarian revolution. We infinitely love our great Party, infinitely love our great leader Chairman Mao, and infinitely believe in the Mao Zedong Thought that guides our progress. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the banner of class struggle, and resolutely defeat Deng Tuo and other small handful of running dogs of Khrushchev's revisionists. "The golden monkey brandishes its mighty club, and the jade firmament is cleared of ten thousand miles of dust. Today we cheer for Sun Dasheng, only because the demon mist has returned again." Today's "Sun Dasheng" is the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the "mighty club" is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. With the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely smash Deng Tuo and other small handful of demons and monsters to pieces and carry the socialist revolution through to the end!

    打垮赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的走卒
    我在莫斯科的反美游行中，受到修正主义集团的镇压和迫害，看透了他们的恶毒用心和反动本质。“三家村”一伙黑帮同他们一唱一和，里应外合，成为赫鲁晓夫修正主义的忠实走卒
    西北大学讲师　黄照庚
    “三家村”、黑店贩卖的黑货，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的黑货完全一模一样。邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等反党反社会主义分子和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是一丘之貉。他们不仅腔调一致，语言一致，而且在行动上也是有计划地互相配合的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，打垮赫鲁晓夫修正主义的走卒。
    在去年三月四日莫斯科亚非留学生反美游行中，我遭到了苏联修正主义集团的残酷镇压和迫害。以后，我们亲爱的党把我接回祖国。一年前的事件，记忆犹新。当我听到“三家村”的黑帮们恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党和毛主席，狂妄地企图在我国复辟资本主义的罪行以后，旧恨新仇一起涌上心头，愤怒的烈火烧炸了胸膛。我们要正告邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子，你们妄想把红色的中国变成黑色的中国，这是白日作梦。我们全国人民都衷心爱戴以伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央，我们一定要彻底打垮你们这群牛鬼蛇神，坚决把这场关系到中国革命和世界革命的伟大斗争进行到底！
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者辱骂我们的领袖毛主席作出的“东风压倒西风”的科学论断，是“荒唐无稽”、“教条主义理论”，邓拓之流则诬蔑这个论断是“伟大的空话”、“陈词滥调”。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者诅咒我们的党“专制”、“独裁”，邓拓之流则咒骂我们的党是“逞强”、“霸道”。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一心想颠覆我们党的领导，把我们党内的右倾机会主义分子说成是他们的“好朋友”，而邓拓之流则到处为罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤，吹捧他们的反党“骨气”，叫嚷要我们的党下台“休息”，鼓励右倾机会主义分子东山再起。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者攻击我国的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进是“说大话”，是“冒险的计划”，是“唯意志论”，邓拓之流则骂我们是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，是凭着马赫派的“心理要素的作用”为所欲为。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者诬蔑我们的总路线、大跃进“失败了”，“垮台了”；邓拓则说我们“一个鸡蛋的家当”，“全部毁掉了”。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者诬蔑我们是“喝大锅清水汤”，邓拓则说“白开水最好喝”，等等。
    请看，邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的气味是多么相投！他们的丑恶嘴脸是多么一样！他们的腔调是多么一致。他们一唱一和，里应外合，真是一丘之貉。
    这群国内外的反动派，在攻击我们伟大的国家伟大的党的行动上，也是完全一致的。一九六一年前后，帝国主义、现代修正主义者和各国反动派，煽起了嚣张一时的反华大合唱，一九六一年十月苏联修正主义者召开了遗臭万年的二十二大；在国内，地富反坏右等牛鬼蛇神，利用我们暂时的经济困难，煽风点火，兴风作浪，妄想推翻我们党的领导，颠覆无产阶级专政。就是在这种情况下，邓拓等反党反社会主义分子，以为时机已到，纷纷出笼，射出了大量毒箭，为资本主义复辟开道。他们完全是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的忠实走卒！
    “三家村”黑店的大掌柜邓拓，不仅和国内外反动派一起攻击我们伟大的党，而且还竭力鼓吹要向赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团学习，说什么要“学习”和“团结”“比自己强”的国家，诬蔑说“如果把老师一脚踢开，那么，他就什么也学不成”。邓拓这一群黑帮究竟是什么货色，要走什么道路，这不是很明白吗？他们是地地道道的修正主义分子，他们要走的正是修正主义的黑路。如果不打倒这一小撮赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的走卒，我们伟大的国家会变成什么样子呢？无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，必须牢牢地记住我们伟大的领袖毛主席的教导，千万不可忘记阶级斗争。彻底打垮反党反社会主义分子的猖狂进攻，才能巩固无产阶级专政，保证我们的国家永不变色！
    邓拓这个反党分子恶毒地攻击我们的无产阶级专政是“霸道”，要我们学习现代修正主义者的所谓“王道”。他们所要的“王道”、“仁政”究竟是什么货色呢？我自己在莫斯科美国大使馆前和我国以及其他亚非拉国家的留学生一道进行反美游行时，就领教过赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的所谓“王道”。七百多名苏联军警对我们这些赤手空拳的反美游行的外国留学生进行了血腥镇压，造成了一百三十多人的流血惨案，这就是他们的“王道”；苏联修正主义当局下令不准受伤的留学生进医院，住进去的要赶出来，赶不走就采用严加拷打的办法，或者送入“疯人院”，这就是他们的“仁政”。很明显，邓拓之流百般赞扬的“王道”正是对革命人民不折不扣的“霸道”，正是血腥的法西斯统治。我们要正告“三家村”黑帮们，你们妄想在我国恢复资产阶级专政，这办不到。我们不仅要打垮你们这群现代修正主义者的走卒，而且要对你们实行无产阶级专政，以其人之道，还治其人之身。
    邓拓这个反社会主义分子，恶毒地诬蔑我们的社会主义建设事业，要我们向苏联修正主义者“学习”，说什么不然的话困难就会“日益增大”。这完全是彻头彻尾的胡说，我们在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线伟大红旗，贯彻了自力更生的方针，取得了极其巨大的成绩，这是有目共睹的事实，谁也抹杀不了。邓拓之流妄想在我国复辟资本主义，他们梦想要象苏联那样实行修正主义的剥削统治。我们亲眼看到，苏联的特权阶层残酷地剥削广大工农群众，他们每月拿几千甚至上万卢布，过着腐化堕落的生活，而广大工人农民生活水平很低，有的工人每月只有三十六个卢布，有些工人每天工作十二至十六小时，才能勉强维持最低的生活。这样的道路，我们是坚决反对的。邓拓之流妄想要我们走回头路，这是根本办不到的。社会主义的阳关大道，我们是走定了，谁想阻挡历史的车轮前进，我们就把他们砸得粉碎。
    邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子采取“和平演变”的手段，竭力散布资产阶级思想和生活方式，要我们在这方面也向苏联修正主义“学习”。他们的真正目的就是用“学问”、“兴趣”等打掩护，从腐蚀人们“生命的三分之一”开始，颠覆整个无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。我们知道，在现代修正主义者统治下的苏联，正是邓拓所宣扬的糜烂的社会。那里，完全是“钱”字当头，“我”字挂帅。教育方面搞的是脱离无产阶级政治，脱离生产劳动的资产阶级教育；文艺方面搞的是十六、十七世纪的老古董和帝王将相、才子佳人，大力宣扬美国生活方式，使高头发、细高跟、黑灯舞、酗酒等到处泛滥。苏联修正主义者利用这样一些乌七八糟的东西腐蚀广大青年，培养资产阶级的接班人。邓拓之流企图采取同样的手段溶化广大的革命干部和青年学生，为“三家村”集团招兵买马。我们愤怒地控诉邓拓等反党反社会主义分子的这种罪恶勾当。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，伟大的毛泽东思想是照亮我们全国人民和全世界革命人民前进道路的灯塔，谁想取消毛泽东思想，谁想腐蚀我们的灵魂，我们就坚决和他斗争到底！
    现在，全国和全世界人民的眼睛都望着我们伟大的党，全国和全世界人民的心都向往着我们伟大的领袖毛主席。在国外时，很多革命的苏联人民和亚非拉的朋友常常向我们表示：“殷切希望中国取得巨大成就”，“希望寄托在毛泽东同志身上”。凡是革命的人们都懂得，离开毛泽东思想，就根本谈不上什么社会主义和共产主义，就不可能取得无产阶级革命的胜利。我们无限热爱我们伟大的党，无限热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，无限信仰指导我们前进的毛泽东思想。我们一定高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高举阶级斗争的旗帜，坚决打垮邓拓等一小撮赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的走卒。“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃，今日欢呼孙大圣，只缘妖雾又重来。”今日的“孙大圣”就是广大的工农兵，“千钧棒”就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，一定把邓拓等一小撮牛鬼蛇神打得稀烂，把社会主义革命进行到底！
