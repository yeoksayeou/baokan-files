	Record This Blood Debt
	By Our Staff Commentator
	The heinous American imperialism has once again committed a bloody crime against the Chinese people. On the afternoon of May 28th, American military aircraft barbarously attacked our fishing boats fishing in the northern part of the Beibu Gulf public sea fishing grounds, killing and wounding as many as twenty-one Chinese fishermen. The Chinese people are extremely indignant and lodge the strongest protest with the Johnson administration, which committed this serious crime.
	Recently, incidents of American imperialism attacking our fishing boats and killing and wounding our fishermen have occurred one after another. On April 7th of this year, our fishing boats were bombed and strafed by American military aircraft on the high seas, and seventeen of our fishermen were killed and wounded. After a little over a month, an incident of even more serious nature of attacking our fishing boats occurred again. This is yet another naked provocation by American imperialism against the Chinese people.
	American imperialism's provocation against the Chinese people is occurring in the context of the Johnson administration's continuous expansion of its war of aggression against Vietnam. The American invasion ringleaders have recently repeatedly stated that the United States must continue this war of aggression and further expand the flames of war. In the words of Rusk on May 24th, the United States "will continue to do what is necessary." This clearly shows that the successive attacks by American military aircraft on our fishing boats fishing in the Beibu Gulf are by no means accidental.
	One fact after another tells the Chinese people that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. American imperialism's policy of being enemies with the Chinese people to the end will not change. Every provocation of theirs reminds the Chinese people: we must be a hundred times more vigilant and constantly prepared.
	The Chinese people warn the American aggressors: the debts you owe, we have recorded them one by one. Debts must be repaid; blood debts must be repaid with blood. The great Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will surely thoroughly settle the debts owed to the Chinese people by American imperialism.

    记下这笔血债
    本报评论员
    万恶的美帝国主义，又一次对中国人民犯下了血腥罪行。五月二十八日下午，美国军用飞机野蛮袭击在北部湾北部公海渔场捕鱼的我国渔船，打死打伤我国渔民达二十一人之多。中国人民愤慨万分，对犯下这一严重罪行的约翰逊政府，提出最强烈的抗议。
    最近一段时期，美帝国主义袭击我国渔船、杀伤我国渔民的事件，接连不断发生。今年四月七日，我国渔船就在公海上遭到美国军用飞机的轰炸扫射，我国渔民被打死打伤十七人。时隔一个多月，竟然又发生性质更为严重的袭击我渔船的事件。这是美帝国主义对中国人民的又一次赤裸裸挑衅。
    美帝国主义向中国人民寻衅，是在约翰逊政府不断扩大侵越战争的情况下发生的。美国侵略头子最近几次三番表示，美国一定要把这场侵略战争打下去，并进一步扩大战火。用腊斯克五月二十四日的话来说，美国“将继续做必要的事情”。这就清楚地表明，美国军用飞机接连袭击在北部湾捕鱼的我国渔船，决不是偶然的。
    一次又一次的事实告诉中国人民，美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。美帝国主义同中国人民为敌到底的政策是不会改变的。它的每一次挑衅都提醒中国人民：我们必须百倍警惕，常备不懈。
    中国人民警告美国侵略者：你欠下的债，我们一笔一笔地记了下来。欠债，是一定要偿还的；血债，必须用血来偿还。用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民，一定要彻底清算美帝国主义欠下中国人民的债。
