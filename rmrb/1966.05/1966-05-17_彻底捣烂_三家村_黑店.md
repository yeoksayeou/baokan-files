    Thoroughly Smash the "Three-Family Village" Black Inn
    Representative to the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman of the Poor Peasants Association of Guiyang County, Ouyang Hengwen

    After reading the materials published in the newspaper exposing Deng Tuo and his gang's anti-Party, anti-socialist activities, my anger soared dozens of feet high. This "Three-Family Village" black inn boss put on red robes and spoke black words, standing in a leading position and engaging in anti-Party, anti-people schemes. We must smash his black inn and thoroughly disarm him.
    Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits used ancient things to satirize the present, made veiled attacks, spread poison everywhere, opposed the General Line, opposed the Great Leap Forward, and opposed the People's Communes, with the aim of carrying out capitalist restoration and wanting the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, that bunch of exploiting ghosts, to ride on our heads again. Deng Tuo! Let me tell you honestly, you are dreaming! We poor and lower-middle peasants grew up in the bitter water jar of the old society. We suffered the most in the past, so we know best where today's sweetness comes from. When I was twenty years old, my father died, and the burden of the family's life fell on my shoulders. I relied entirely on selling firewood, carrying loads, doing odd jobs, and working as a long-term laborer to make a living. One winter, I went to Guangzhou to help capitalists carry charcoal, and I fell into the river with the charcoal, almost losing my life. With great difficulty, I raised my eldest son to eighteen years old. I thought I would have a helper, but the pseudo-chief came to grab my eldest son as a conscript. I reluctantly pawned the three fen of ancestral land, two fen of soil, and a tea mountain to the landlord's family for five dan of grain and fifteen silver dollars, hoping to exempt my eldest son from "military service." Who knew that in less than a month, my eldest son was still tied up and taken away. Hai Zi's mother became seriously ill, and Hai Zi, who was just two months old, and his sister, who was less than three years old, also fell ill. In these days of poverty and illness, an unexpected "snow on the frost" encounter came. The landlord Liu Xianjing suddenly broke into the door, saying that my father borrowed four dan of grain from him, and over the past ten years, the principal and interest had rolled into fifty-three dan of grain, which he wanted to be repaid. As soon as the landlord left, the moneylender came to force repayment again, saying that the seventeen dan of grain my father borrowed when he died, including principal and interest, had to be repaid with forty-seven dan. How could poor people bear such heavy debts to the King of Hell! There was no way but to be forced to work as a long-term laborer in Liu Xianjing's house, working like an ox and a horse for six years without a penny. Hai Zi's mother, with her children, lived on begging for rice. Finally, in 1949, the Communist Party came, and the People's Liberation Army came. I, an old poor peasant who was bent over by the old society, completely turned over, just like thousands of poor brothers. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would we poor and lower-middle peasants be today! Deng Tuo! You want to oppose the Party, you want to oppose Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will not allow it! We poor and lower-middle peasants have Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. When we shine the demon-revealing mirror, no demons or monsters can escape. You, a small "Three-Family Village" black inn, want to rebel. That's like a maggot trying to move a millstone—overestimating yourself.
    Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of our working people. Whoever opposes the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we will immediately fight with him. I am sixty-six years old this year, and I am not too old. My revolutionary spirit is even stronger. In order to defend the Party and defend socialism, our whole family will always stand at the forefront of the revolution. My third son, Ouyang Hai, contributed his life to the revolution, setting a good example for our whole family. In 1963, I sent my fourth son, Ouyang Hu, to the army again. Now he is a soldier in the "Ouyang Hai Class," and he has gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party and become a Five-Good Soldier. My fifth son was elected secretary of the brigade's Communist Youth League branch in this socialist education movement and is wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution. My sixth son is studying at Guiyang No. 3 Middle School, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and is also a three-good student. Our whole family wants to carry the revolution through to the end. With the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our socialist country is as solid as iron!
    Warning to Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and all anti-Party elements: Your only way out is to bow your heads and admit your guilt, and completely surrender!

    彻底捣烂“三家村”黑店
    全国人民代表大会代表、桂阳县贫协副主席　欧阳恒文
    看了报上登的揭发邓拓一伙反党、反社会主义的材料，我的怒火冲起几十丈高。这个“三家村”黑店老板，穿起红袍讲黑话，站在领导工作的位子上干反党反人民的勾当。我们要把他的黑店捣烂，彻底缴他的械。
    邓拓这伙黑帮分子借古非今，指桑骂槐，到处放毒，反对总路线，反对大跃进，反对人民公社，目的就是要搞资本主义复辟，想让地主阶级、资产阶级那班剥削鬼重新骑到我们头上来。邓拓！老实告诉你，你这是做梦！我们贫下中农是旧社会苦水坛子里泡大的，我们过去受苦最深，也就最晓得今天的甜是从哪里来的。我二十岁那年死了爹，一家的生活担子落在我的肩上，全靠卖柴、挑脚、打零工、做长工过日子。有年冬天，我到广州帮资本家挑木炭，连人带炭倒在河里，差点丢了性命。好容易把大崽带大到十八岁，我满以为有个帮手了，哪晓得伪保长就来抓我大崽当壮丁。我忍心把祖遗的三分田、两分土、一块茶山，向地主家当了五担谷、十五元银洋，送给伪保长，想免了大崽的“兵役”。谁知不到一个月，大崽还是被他们五花大绑捆去了。海子的妈急病了，刚满两月的海子和他不到三岁的姐姐也拖病了。在这贫病交加的日子里，不料又来了一个“雪上加霜”的遭遇。地主刘显经突然闯进门来，说我爹借了他四担谷，十几年连本带利滚成了五十三担谷，就要还。地主刚出门，放债的又来逼债了，说我爹死时借的十七担谷，连本带利要还四十七担。这么重的阎王债，穷人哪里背得起啊！没有办法，只好被迫到刘显经家里做长工，一连当了六年牛马，一文钱也没有。海子的妈，拖儿带女，靠讨米过日子。好容易盼到了一九四九年，共产党来了，解放军来了，我这个被旧社会压得弯腰驼背的老贫农，才和千千万万穷兄弟一样，彻底翻了身。不是共产党、毛主席，我们贫下中农哪里有今日！邓拓！你要反党，你要反对毛主席，我们贫下中农不准许！我们贫下中农有毛泽东思想做武器，用照妖镜一照，什么妖魔鬼怪也跑不了。你一个小小的“三家村”黑店想造反，那是蛆婆拱磨子——不自量力。
    毛主席是我们劳动人民心里的红太阳。谁要反对党和毛主席的领导，我们马上就跟他干。我今年六十六岁，年纪还不老，革命的劲头更旺。为了保卫党，保卫社会主义，我们全家永远站在革命最前列。我的三儿子欧阳海为革命贡献了生命，给我们全家立了个好榜样。一九六三年，我又送老四欧阳湖参了军，现在他在“欧阳海班”当战士，已经光荣地参加了中国共产党，并且成为五好战士。老五在这次社会主义教育运动中当选为大队团支部书记，一心为革命。老六在桂阳三中读书，听毛主席的话，也是个三好学生。我们这一家，全都要革命到底。有党和毛主席的英明领导，我们的社会主义江山是铁打的！
    警告邓拓、吴晗和所有的反党分子：你们只有低头认罪，彻底缴械投降，才是唯一的出路！
