    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 1st (By our correspondent) It is reported that since the establishment of the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions five years ago, the workers of South Vietnam have actively launched struggles against the American aggressors and the South Vietnamese traitorous clique, making significant contributions to the cause of resisting America and saving the nation.
    Over the past five years, the workers' movement in enemy-occupied areas has flourished. According to statistics, urban workers and laborers have carried out more than 9,200 political struggles, with 5.5 million participants. They have adopted various forms of struggle, such as strikes, slowdowns, rallies, and demonstrations. They demanded that the American aggressors stop the war of aggression against Vietnam, opposed "sweeps" and conscription, demanded increased wages and lower prices, and struck the American robbers and their lackeys from all sides.
    Last year, workers and students in Saigon-Cholon held large-scale struggles and burned down the U.S. Information Service. Workers in ports such as Vung Tau, Da Nang, Cam Ranh, and airports such as Can Tho also held continuous strikes, refusing to transport weapons and war materials for the American aggressors. In particular, the week-long strike launched by workers in Da Nang City, an important U.S. base in South Vietnam, in July last year, paralyzed the entire Da Nang base. These struggles have caused serious losses to the enemy.
    At the same time, workers in enemy-occupied areas, under the leadership of the Liberation Federation of Trade Unions at all levels in the South, also organized worker armed self-defense forces and guerrillas to carry out armed struggles in the enemy's dens. In recent years, the armed self-defense organizations of workers in Saigon City, in coordination with the Liberation Army, have carried out 120 battles in Saigon. The guerrillas composed of plantation workers in the eastern part of the South carried out 250 battles last year, eliminating and disintegrating more than 1,860 enemy soldiers, seizing large quantities of weapons and military supplies, and destroying 21 "strategic hamlets." In addition, tens of thousands of workers enthusiastically joined the Liberation Army and rushed to the front to kill the enemy. Workers also organized civilian labor teams to serve the front. In the Dau Tieng area alone, thousands of young male and female workers participated in civilian support teams. (Attached picture)

    从各方面沉重打击美国强盗及其走狗
    南越工人积极展开反美伪集团斗争
    五年来敌占区城市工人进行九千多次政治斗争，参加人数五百五十万人次
    新华社河内一日电　本社记者报道，自越南南方解放工会联合会成立五年来，越南南方工人积极开展反对美国侵略者和南越卖国集团的斗争，为抗美救国事业作出了重大贡献。
    五年来，敌占区的工人运动日益蓬勃发展，据统计，城市工人和劳动者进行了九千二百多次政治斗争，参加人数达五百五十万人次。他们采取了罢工、怠工、集会和游行示威等各种斗争形式。他们要求美国侵略者停止侵越战争，反对“扫荡”、抓兵，要求增加工资、降低物价，从各方面打击了美国强盗及其走狗。
    去年，在西贡—堤岸，工人、学生举行了声势浩大的斗争，并烧毁了美国新闻处。头顿、岘港、金兰等港口和芹苴等机场的工人，也连续举行罢工，拒绝给美国侵略者搬运武器和战争物资，特别是去年七月间，美国在南越的重要基地——岘港市的工人开展的为期一周的罢工，使整个岘港基地陷于瘫痪。这些斗争，都给敌人造成了严重的损失。
    与此同时，敌占区的工人，还在南方各级解放工会联合会的领导下，组织工人武装自卫队和游击队，在敌人的巢穴里开展武装斗争。几年来，西贡市工人的武装自卫组织，同解放军配合，在西贡进行了一百二十次战斗。由南部东区种植园工人组成的游击队，去年进行了二百五十次战斗，消灭和瓦解敌人一千八百六十多名，缴获大批武器和军用物资，捣毁了二十一个“战略村”。此外，还有数以万计的工人踊跃参加解放军，奔赴前线杀敌。工人还组织民工队为前线服务。仅油汀地区，就有成千名男女青年工人参加了支前民工队。（附图片）
