    Congratulations to Guyana on its Independence
    After achieving internal autonomy in 1961, the former British Guiana officially declared its independence today. Our Premier Zhou Enlai has sent a telegram to Guyana's national leaders, extending warm congratulations to the people of Guyana. The Chinese people are sincerely pleased with the achievement made by the Guyanese people.
    Guyana's independence is the result of the long-term struggle of the Guyanese people. For a century and a half, the people of Guyana have waged heroic and unyielding struggles, one after another, to resist British colonial rule and fight for national independence. Especially since the end of the war, the Guyanese people have waged fierce and repeated struggles against British colonialism. In 1953, Britain was forced to promulgate a constitution in Guyana and hold parliamentary elections. However, shortly thereafter, the British colonialists used force to dissolve the Guyanese government, formed through elections, which advocated national independence. Under the pressure of the people's struggle, in 1961, Britain was again forced to announce its agreement to grant Guyana "internal self-government" and decided that Guyana would achieve independence within the Commonwealth two years later. After this, the British colonialists adopted conspiratorial means to create riots in Guyana and used this as an excuse to make a decision to postpone Guyana's independence indefinitely. However, all this could not shake the Guyanese people's determination to resolutely demand freedom from colonial rule. The flames of the struggle for national independence burned more and more fiercely in Guyana. It was precisely under these circumstances that the British colonialists had no choice but to announce last November that they agreed to Guyana's transition from self-government to independence.
    The development of the situation in Guyana in recent years has once again proved a truth: Imperialists and colonialists will never willingly withdraw from their vested positions, and will never hand over independence to oppressed nations on a silver platter. In the past, some "concessions" made and some "promises" made by British colonialists to the Guyanese people were nothing more than a tactic to deal with the national independence movement, a technique to disintegrate the people's will to struggle. In order to maintain their colonial rule, they could discard all pretenses at any time, tear up all promises, reveal their ferocious faces full of murderous intent, and carry out bloody suppression of the Guyanese people. Today, although Guyana has declared its independence, this does not mean that British colonialists have changed their nature and will not counterattack and make a comeback. Moreover, beside the people of Guyana, there is an even more dangerous enemy, namely the American neo-colonialists. For a long time, the United States has supported British colonialists in suppressing and undermining the Guyanese people's struggle for national independence, and has tried to incorporate Guyana into its sphere of influence. At present, it is stepping up its efforts to extend its sinister hands into Guyana. Therefore, continuing to strengthen the struggle against colonialism, defeating the conspiracies of British old colonialism and American neo-colonialism, remains a serious task facing the Guyanese people.
    The Guyanese people's struggle for independence has received the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. In the current era, imperialism and colonialism are bound to perish, and the national liberation movement has become an irresistible historical trend. The Guyanese people, with their tradition of heroic struggle, as long as they continue to strengthen unity, be vigilant against the various conspiracies of new and old colonialists, and continue to persist in the anti-colonialist struggle, will surely be able to defend the fruits of the struggle and achieve true and complete national independence.

### 祝贺圭亚那独立

    祝贺圭亚那独立
    前英属圭亚那在一九六一年取得内部自治地位之后，今天正式宣告独立。我国周恩来总理已致电圭亚那国家领导人，向圭亚那人民表示热烈的祝贺。中国人民为圭亚那人民所取得的这一成就感到由衷的高兴。
    圭亚那的独立，是圭亚那人民长期斗争的结果。一个半世纪以来，圭亚那人民为了反抗英国殖民统治、争取民族独立，前赴后继地进行了英勇不屈的斗争。特别是战后以来，圭亚那人民同英国殖民主义者更是进行了激烈的反复的斗争。一九五三年，英国被迫在圭亚那颁布宪法，举行议会选举。但是不久后，英国殖民主义者就用武力解散了通过选举成立的主张民族独立的圭亚那政府。在人民斗争的压力下，一九六一年，英国又被迫宣布同意给圭亚那以“内部自治权”，并决定圭亚那两年后在英联邦内取得独立。在这以后，英国殖民主义者却采取阴谋手段，在圭亚那制造骚乱，并以此为借口作出无限期推迟圭亚那独立的决定。但是，这一切并不能动摇圭亚那人民坚决要求摆脱殖民统治的决心。争取民族独立的斗争怒火，在圭亚那越来越猛烈地燃烧起来了。正是在这种情况下，英国殖民主义者才不得不在去年十一月宣布同意圭亚那从自治走向独立。
    几年来圭亚那局势的发展再一次证明了一个真理：帝国主义和殖民主义者是决不会甘心退出它们既得的阵地的，是决不会把独立放在银盘子里端给被压迫民族的。过去，英国殖民主义者对圭亚那人民作出的一些“让步”，许下的一些“诺言”，都不过是对付民族独立运动的一种策略，是瓦解人民斗争意志的一种手法。他们为了维护自己的殖民统治，随时可以丢掉一切伪装，撕毁一切诺言，露出杀气腾腾的狰狞面目，对圭亚那人民进行血腥镇压。今天，圭亚那虽然已经宣布独立了，但是这决不意味着英国殖民主义者已经改变本性，不会再进行反扑而卷土重来了。不仅如此，在圭亚那人民身边，还有着一个更加危险的敌人，这就是美国新殖民主义者。长期以来，美国一直支持英国殖民主义者镇压和破坏圭亚那人民的民族独立斗争，并且力图把圭亚那并入自己的势力范围。目前，它正加紧把黑手伸进圭亚那。因此，继续加强反对殖民主义的斗争，击败英国老殖民主义和美国新殖民主义的阴谋活动，仍然是摆在圭亚那人民面前的严重任务。
    圭亚那人民争取独立的斗争，得到中国人民和全世界人民的同情和支持。在当前的时代里，帝国主义和殖民主义必然要走向灭亡，民族解放运动已经成为不可抗拒的历史潮流。有着英勇斗争传统的圭亚那人民，只要不断加强团结，警惕新老殖民主义者的各种阴谋，并且继续坚持反殖民主义的斗争，就一定能够保卫斗争的成果，取得真正的、完全的民族独立。
