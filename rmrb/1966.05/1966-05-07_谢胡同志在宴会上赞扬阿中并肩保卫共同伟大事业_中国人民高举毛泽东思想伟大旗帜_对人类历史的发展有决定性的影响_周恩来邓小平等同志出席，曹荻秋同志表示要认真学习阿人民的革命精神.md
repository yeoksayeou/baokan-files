    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th -- Comrade Shehu and all comrades of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by him attended a welcome banquet held by Comrade Cao Diqiu in Shanghai tonight. In his speech, Comrade Shehu pointed out that hundreds of millions of Chinese people are holding high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, the great banner of Comrade Mao Zedong’s thought, deeply carrying out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, and extensively conducting socialist education movements in urban and rural areas. This is not only to raise their motherland to the highest level of world development, but also to use their revolutionary labor and achievements to exert a greater and decisive influence on the development of human history.

    Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others attended this welcome banquet held by Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, for the Albanian guests.

    Comrade Shehu delivered an enthusiastic speech at the banquet. He said that the welcome given to us by the people of Shanghai and people all over China vividly demonstrates the fraternal, internationalist love and solidarity of the heroic and great Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party of China towards the Albanian people and their Party of Labor.

    He said that our people and our Party hold the same deep friendship, internationalist solidarity, love, and deep respect for the fraternal Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and their great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, our people's most respected and greatest friend. The Albanian people are proud of the ever-strengthening and developing eternal friendship with the great Chinese people.

    Comrade Shehu said that the Albanian Party of Labor believes that one cannot be a steadfast Marxist-Leninist without resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism while opposing the Soviet Khrushchev revisionists, without resolutely upholding the profound revolutionary stance of the Chinese Communist Party, and without understanding the universal significance of the revolutionary activities of the Chinese Communist Party and the great thought of Comrade Mao Zedong.

    Comrade Shehu said that the Albanian and Chinese parties, governments, and peoples have common thoughts and aspirations, which is to defend the common, great, and lofty cause. He said that the common struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and opposing Khrushchev revisionism unites our two parties together, and no force in the world can hinder this friendship.

    Comrade Shehu said that the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China are an insurmountable copper wall and iron bastion for U.S. imperialists and the current leaders of Soviet Khrushchev revisionism and their followers. The Communist Party of China has held high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism and bravely exposed and resolutely struggled against the Soviet revisionists' capitulation and collusion with U.S. imperialism, their betrayal of Marxism-Leninism, and their betrayal of the interests of the Soviet people, the people of socialist camp countries, and the revolutionary movements of the people of the world. The people of the world are happy and encouraged by this.

    Comrade Shehu spoke about China's achievements in industry, agriculture, national defense, and scientific and cultural construction. He said that China's strong national defense force not only guarantees the victory of socialism in China but also safeguards the interests of the socialist camp and the interests of the people of all countries from infringement by imperialism and its accomplices.

    In his speech, Comrade Shehu praised the Shanghai people for further maintaining and carrying forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, implementing the great thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, and continuously advancing on the broad road of socialist revolution and construction, achieving magnificent victories.

    Comrade Shehu's speech aroused bursts of warm applause in the hall.

    Comrade Cao Diqiu spoke at the beginning of the banquet. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, and the people of Shanghai, he extended the warmest greetings and the most enthusiastic welcome to the Albanian guests. He said that the Party organization and the people of the city of Shanghai, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have greatly changed the city. However, our work is far from enough. In addition to continuing to study Chairman Mao's works conscientiously and summarizing our own experience, we must also earnestly learn from the Albanian people's spirit of adhering to the truth, daring to struggle, and continuously making revolution, taking the valuable experience of the Albanian people's revolution and construction as a driving force for promoting our work and striving to further develop Shanghai's socialist cause.

    Cao Diqiu said that revolutionary red hearts closely link our two countries together. The great unity and sacred friendship forged between China and Albania have already dealt a huge blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. In the future, in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and in the great cause of building socialism, we, the people of Shanghai, will, like the people of the whole country, always support each other and advance side by side with the Albanian people.

    Wu Xiuquan, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Bingnan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Xu Jianguo, our country's ambassador to Albania, attended the banquet as companions. Also attending the banquet were Ma Tianshui, Wang Yiping, Liang Guobin, Yang Xiguang, Wang Shaoyong, Shi Ying, Song Richang, Song Jiwen, Li Gancheng, Jin Zhonghua, Zhang Chengzong, Zhao Zukang and other responsible persons from the East China and Shanghai municipal party, government, and military organizations.

    中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大旗帜  对人类历史的发展有决定性的影响
    周恩来邓小平等同志出席，曹荻秋同志表示要认真学习阿人民的革命精神
    新华社上海六日电　谢胡同志和由他率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，今晚在上海出席了曹荻秋同志举行的欢迎宴会。谢胡同志在讲话中指出，亿万中国人民高举马克思列宁主义红旗，高举毛泽东同志伟大思想旗帜，深入开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，广泛进行城乡社会主义教育运动，这不仅是为了使自己的祖国提高到世界发展的最高水平，而且是为了用自己的革命劳动和成就，对人类历史的发展给予更大的决定性的影响。
    中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来，中共中央总书记邓小平，中共中央华东局书记处书记魏文伯等，出席了中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市市长曹荻秋为阿尔巴尼亚贵宾举行的这个欢迎宴会。
    谢胡同志在宴会上作了热情洋溢的讲话。他说，上海人民和中国各地人民对我们的欢迎，生动地表现了英雄的、伟大的中国人民及其光荣的中国共产党，对阿尔巴尼亚人民及其劳动党的兄弟般的、国际主义的热爱感情和团结一致。
    他说，我国人民和我们党，对兄弟的中国人民、中国共产党及其伟大的领袖、我国人民最敬爱的最伟大的朋友毛泽东同志，同样怀着深厚的友好感情、国际主义的团结、热爱和深切的敬意。阿尔巴尼亚人民为同伟大的中国人民的日益加强和发展的永恒友谊而感到自豪。
    谢胡同志说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党认为，不坚决地在反对美帝国主义的同时反对苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，不坚决拥护中国共产党的深刻的革命立场，不了解中国共产党的革命活动和毛泽东同志的伟大思想的普遍意义，就不是坚定的马克思列宁主义者。
    谢胡同志说，阿中两党、两国政府和人民，有着共同的思想和愿望，这就是保卫共同的伟大的崇高的事业。他说，反对以美国为首的帝国主义，捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的共同斗争，把我们两党联结在一起，世界上没有任何力量可以妨碍这种友谊。
    谢胡同志说，中国共产党和中华人民共和国，是美帝国主义者和苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义现领导及其追随者不可逾越的铜墙铁壁。中国共产党高举马克思列宁主义的战无不胜的大旗，对苏联修正主义者投降和勾结美帝国主义，背叛马克思列宁主义，出卖苏联人民、社会主义阵营各国人民以及世界各国人民革命运动利益的活动，在全世界面前进行了勇敢的揭露和坚决的斗争。全世界人民为此感到高兴和鼓舞。
    谢胡同志谈到了中国在工业、农业、国防和科学、文化建设方面所取得的成就。他说，中国的强大国防力量不仅保障社会主义在中国的胜利，而且保障社会主义阵营的利益和各国人民的利益，免遭帝国主义及其同伙的侵害。
    谢胡同志在讲话中赞扬上海人民进一步保持和发扬了光荣的革命传统，贯彻执行了毛泽东同志的伟大思想，在社会主义革命和建设的康庄大道上不断前进，取得了宏伟的胜利。
   谢胡同志的讲话在全场激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    曹荻秋同志在宴会开始时讲话。他代表中国共产党上海市委员会、上海市人民委员会和上海人民，向阿尔巴尼亚贵宾致以最亲切的问候和最热烈的欢迎。他说，上海党的组织和全市人民，遵照党中央的指示，高高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，已经使这个城市大大地变了样。但是，我们的工作做得很不够，我们除了需要继续认真学习毛主席著作、总结自己经验而外，还要认真地学习阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持真理、敢于斗争、不断革命的精神，把阿尔巴尼亚人民革命和建设的宝贵经验作为推进我们工作的动力，为进一步发展上海的社会主义事业而努力。
    曹荻秋说，革命的红心，把我们两国紧密地联系在一起。中阿两国结成的伟大团结和神圣友谊，已经给予帝国主义和现代修正主义巨大的打击。今后，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的革命斗争中，在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，我们上海人民将同全国人民一样，永远同阿尔巴尼亚人民相互支持，并肩前进。
    中共中央委员伍修权、外交部副部长王炳南、我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使许建国出席宴会作陪。出席宴会作陪的，还有华东和上海市党、政府、军队负责人马天水、王一平、梁国斌、杨西光、王少庸、石英、宋日昌、宋季文、李干成、金仲华、张承宗、赵祖康等。
    宴会后，宾主出席了上海市文化局为欢迎阿尔巴尼亚贵宾所举行的文艺晚会。晚会上演出了现代革命京剧《智取威虎山》。演出结束后，谢胡、卡博同志等在周恩来、邓小平、魏文伯、曹荻秋、马天水等同志陪同下，走上舞台和演员一一握手，赠送花篮并合影留念。
