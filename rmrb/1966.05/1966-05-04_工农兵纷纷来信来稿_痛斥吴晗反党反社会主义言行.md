    Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Send Letters and Articles
    Denouncing Wu Han's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Words and Deeds
    Since newspapers and periodicals have launched criticisms of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist stance and ideology, especially since the publication of the two batches of materials on Wu Han's reactionary political thought and academic viewpoints, this newspaper has received a large number of letters and articles from workers, peasants, and soldiers every day. In their letters and articles, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have plunged into the battle with great political enthusiasm, angrily denouncing Wu Han's reactionary political thought. They unanimously stated that they must defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attack and win the complete victory in this struggle.
      We Must Thoroughly Crush Wu Han's Rampant Attack
    All letters and articles from workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously point out that Wu Han's works such as "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are great poisonous weeds that oppose the Party and oppose socialism. He used the shell of Hai Rui to speak up for the Right opportunists and encouraged the Right opportunists who had been "dismissed" by the people to "try again after failing". They said: The struggle between Wu Han and us is a major class struggle on the political and ideological front. Wu Han opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and fanatically supports Right opportunists; while we support the Party, support socialism, love Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely oppose Right opportunists. Wu Han's position and views are diametrically opposed to those of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Hou Guangxing, a worker at the Fenghuangshan Mine of the Jincheng Mining Bureau in Shanxi, wrote: "Wu Han's works such as "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" blatantly support Right opportunists and frantically oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Wu Han stands on a position hostile to us; what he opposes is precisely what we love. We advocate class analysis, but he uses the label of "theory of pure bloodlines" to oppose it; we want the dictatorship of the proletariat, but he wants emperors, generals, landlords, and the bourgeoisie to rule the people again; we want to promote communist morality, but he promotes corrupt feudal morality and bourgeois morality; we sing the praises of leaders of peasant uprisings, but he sings the praises of Hai Rui and Zhou Chen. Wu Han's views are incompatible with those of us workers." Liu Heng, a worker at the factory of the Institute of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power Research, wrote: "Wu Han's thinking runs counter to ours. We want to 'never forget the bitterness of exploitation and firmly remember class hatred,' but he tells us that it doesn't matter if we are exploited, because there are "upright officials" to take care of us. We want to move towards socialism, but he wants to take the capitalist road. He is truly rampant to the extreme. We must resolutely defeat Wu Han's rampant attack."
    Many letters from workers, peasants, and soldiers point out that Wu Han is a spokesperson for the bourgeoisie and a person who is determined to follow the road of Hu Shi. His anti-Party and anti-people thinking is consistent. They said: Wu Han's cursing of us is not accidental. Judging from the two batches of materials exposed by the People's Daily, he cursed us decades ago, calling us "bandits," "a swarm of bees," and "scattered like birds and beasts." He has cursed us for more than thirty years, openly cursing in the past, and now cursing implicitly. Now is the time for us to counterattack.
    Ma Runhe, a worker at a factory in Tianshui City, Gansu Province, wrote: Wu Han thinks that he can confuse us workers by reversing right and wrong and distorting historical facts, but things have turned out contrary to his expectations. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "In a society where classes exist, class struggle will not end." No matter how cunning Wu Han is, he cannot escape the eyes of the working class.
      Unmask Wu Han's Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Tactics
    Letters and articles from workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously point out that in the new situation of class struggle, Wu Han uses essays, dramas, and other forms to "use the past to satirize the present," implicitly attacking the Party and socialism. We must unmask Wu Han's tactics. Wu Han holds up "upright officials" and promotes the spirit of Hai Rui, attempting to blur class boundaries, which is extremely vicious. The so-called "upright officials" are a great scam deliberately set up by the feudal landlord class and their chieftains.
    Feng Qingjiang, a worker at the Nü'erhe Paper Mill in Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, wrote: "Wu Han insists that Hai Rui stood on the side of the poor and spoke for the working people, which is a lie. Hai Rui sought welfare for the feudal landlord class and worked for the emperor. He was a member of the exploiting class and would never stand on the side of the working people." Fan Lianzhong, a worker at the Inner Mongolia First Machinery Factory in Baotou, wrote: "Whether they are 'upright officials' or 'corrupt officials,' they are all officials, and their essence is reactionary. Wu Han said that Hai Rui 'stood on the side of the people, opposed bad people and bad things throughout his life, and never opposed good people and good things.' This is a blatant lie. Hai Rui was a reactionary fellow whose hands were stained with the blood of the people. But Wu Han said that he never opposed good people and good things, truly wanting to cover the sky with one hand!"
    Sun Zhian, a worker at the Chaoyang Electric Power Bureau in Liaoning Province, wrote: "Wu Han said that Hai Rui spared no personal effort to seek welfare for the working people, which is purely a distortion of history. All crows are black, and Wu Han's attempt to put a colorful coat on the black crows is futile."
    Wang Yuqing, a soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, wrote: "I do not recognize the so-called "upright officials" in Chinese history. "Upright officials" were promoted by the reactionary exploiting classes, they are smiling tigers, and they are corrosives. What we want today are good cadres like Jiao Yulu, and only in today's society can there be good cadres like Jiao Yulu. We have thoroughly overthrown the feudal exploiting class, and we must also thoroughly eliminate the ideological poison of "upright officials" spread by people like Wu Han of the feudal exploiting class."
    Resolutely Refute Wu Han's Vicious Slanders of the Working People
    Workers, peasants, and soldiers also refuted Wu Han's slanders of the working people and praise of emperors and generals in their articles. Tian Xiquan, a young worker at the Huanan County Agricultural Machinery Factory in Heilongjiang Province, wrote: "Wu Han said that in the past historical era, the leading role was played by emperors and generals, and that poor and lower-middle peasants achieved nothing in their lives. This is truly the greatest slander! May I ask which engineering construction or which invention was not the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the working people? It was the peasant uprisings and peasant wars that promoted historical progress. Wu Han stands on the position of the landlord and fights for the position of emperors and generals. What he wants to continue is the genealogy of the exploiting class."
    Li Zhizhu, an educated youth of the Wang'anbao Brigade of the Jianzhuang Commune in Handan, Hebei Province, wrote: "Thousands of years of Chinese history books have all been written by feudal literati. The working people have been suppressed for thousands of years, and the masses of people have been distorted and丑化 in historical books. In 1963, an old poor peasant held our village history in his hands, tears streaming down his face, and said: 'This is the history book of us poor and lower-middle peasants!' Today, we of the proletariat are in charge and we must rewrite history from the proletarian point of view and reverse the history that has been reversed by feudal literati like Wu Han."
        We Must Not Allow Wu Han to Poison Young People
    The proletariat wants to cultivate its own revolutionary successors, and the bourgeoisie is also doing everything possible to cultivate successors for their counter-revolutionary exploiting cause. Wu Han is vigorously cultivating successors for the bourgeoisie. Many letters from workers, peasants, and soldiers expressed indignation at Wu Han's reactionary behavior of poisoning the younger generation and even the younger generation.
    Zhang Huarong, a soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, wrote: "The Party and Chairman Mao have always been very concerned about us young people. Chairman Mao compared us young people to the sun at eight or nine in the morning, saying: 'Hope is placed on you.' But Wu Han, the representative of the bourgeois reactionaries, also places hope on us. Wu Han poisoned young people everywhere, spreading the idea of personal struggle, becoming famous and establishing a career, telling young people to read books behind closed doors, not to participate in political movements, and to overcome all difficulties to become experts and scholars. In a word, he wants us to be bourgeois counter-revolutionary successors. Let me tell you, Wu Han, we young people will never listen to your set of ideas. We will resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the direction pointed out by the Party, and be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."
    Zhang Hetong, a commune member of the Xiashuangtuo Village of the Jianzigou Commune in Fengnan County, Hebei Province, wrote: "The broad masses of young people are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to go to the vast countryside to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to temper themselves in the three major revolutionary struggles. This is 'very good.' Only Wu Han scolds us, slanders us, and says 'very bad.'"
    Wang Fulin, a radio repair worker at the Yixian Broadcasting Service Department in Hebei Province, wrote: "Wu Han poisons young people, wanting young people to engage in individual heroism, and everything must be based on their own ideas. Not listening to other people's opinions and rejecting other people's criticism is 'upright and unyielding' and 'has backbone.'"
    Wang Yunbin, a worker at the prefabricated factory of the First Engineering Department of the Yellow River Engineering Bureau in Inner Mongolia, wrote: "I am an industrial worker, and what I need most is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to engage in socialist construction. Wu Han opposes our studying Chairman Mao's works, which shows that we are doing the right thing, and we must redouble our efforts to study Chairman Mao's works."
      Always Listen to Chairman Mao's Words and Follow the Communist Party
    Many letters from workers, peasants, and soldiers talk about the exploitation they suffered in the old society and the oppression of feudalism and capitalism, explaining that only the Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of the people, and only by following the Communist Party on the bright road of socialism can there be truly happy lives.
    Li Laijun, a worker at the Luoyang Tractor Forging Factory, wrote: "On the north bank of our Yellow River, before liberation, it was a vast expanse of saline-alkali land, no crops grew, and the people suffered disasters. After the establishment of the People's Commune, rivers were dug and canals were built, suppressing the saline-alkali, and the desolate wasteland of the past was transformed into good red soil, with green crops, truly turning Hebei into Jiangnan. We have gone from fleeing famine and begging for food every year to now selling surplus grain by the team and everyone having enough food and clothing. This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Wu Han vainly dreams of changing the world, isn't this daydreaming!"
    Liu Deshun, a poor peasant of the Xishankou Brigade of the Shisanling Commune in Changping, wrote: "The Party and Chairman Mao led us onto the path of collectivization, and life is getting better day by day. Now, whenever I think of the time when we worked individually, I feel sad. Chairman Mao saved us from the fire pit, and we poor and lower-middle peasants truly stood up straight and lived a good life. If Wu Han wants to take away our happiness, we will resolutely fight him to the end."
    Zhang Guanglu, a railway worker at the Zhengjiatun Railway Bureau in Jinzhou, wrote: "When I was five or six years old, my father was laid off by the weaving factory, and the whole family of four had nothing to eat. My mother had just given birth to my little sister, and in order to survive, she sold her own flesh and blood and went to nurse someone else's child. I worked for the landlord as a hired hand when I was nine years old, working like an ox and a horse. Once, I got up at five o'clock in the morning to cook for the landlord, and the fire came out of the stove door and burned my leg. It still hurts when it rains on cloudy days. Wu Han wants to lead us extremely viciously onto the black road of capitalism, and we must thoroughly expose his vicious conspiracy."
    Chen Xiaoxing of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "The beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are the great saviors of the people of the whole country, the red sun in our hearts, and great socialism is the lifeline of our 650 million people. We love the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, socialism, and the three red banners from the bottom of our hearts. Whoever opposes the Party and opposes socialism is opposing the Chinese people. Whether he is literary, martial, open, or hidden, we will fight him! We want to solemnly tell Wu Han that the people's country is made of iron and cannot be overthrown. Since you have launched a challenge to the people of the whole country, then the people of the whole country will surely rise up to meet the challenge and resolutely fight you to the end!"
    The salient features of the articles from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are: clear class viewpoints and full of political enthusiasm. Each article is clearly distinct in what it loves and hates, and the words are filled with hatred for Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist stance and thinking, and filled with infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao. These articles can all grasp the key political issues and give powerful criticisms with one shot. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are rising up to denounce Wu Han's reactionary words and deeds and actively participating in the Great Cultural Revolution struggle. This is an exciting and epoch-making event on the ideological front in our country.

### 工农兵纷纷来信来稿  痛斥吴晗反党反社会主义言行

专栏：

    工农兵纷纷来信来稿
    痛斥吴晗反党反社会主义言行
    自从报刊上对吴晗反党反社会主义的立场和思想开展批判以来，特别是关于吴晗的反动政治思想和学术观点的两批材料公布以来，本报每天都收到工农兵群众大量来信来稿。在来信来稿中，工农兵群众以极大的政治热情投入了战斗，愤怒斥责吴晗的反动政治思想。他们一致表示，一定要打垮资产阶级的猖狂进攻，赢得这场斗争的彻底胜利。
      必须彻底粉碎吴晗的猖狂进攻
    所有工农兵来信来稿一致指出：吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》、
  《海瑞罢官》等作品是反党反社会主义的大毒草。他借海瑞的躯壳，为右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，并鼓励被人民“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子“失败了再干”。他们说：吴晗同我们之间的斗争，是政治思想战线上一场重大的阶级斗争。吴晗反对党、反对社会主义、反对毛泽东思想，狂热支持右倾机会主义分子；我们则拥护党、拥护社会主义，热爱毛泽东思想，坚决反对右倾机会主义分子。吴晗的立场、观点和工农兵的立场、观点是针锋相对的。
    山西晋城矿务局凤凰山矿工人侯光兴来信说：“吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》等作品，露骨地支持右倾机会主义分子，疯狂地反党反社会主义。吴晗站在同我们敌对的立场上，他反对的，恰恰是我们热爱的。我们主张阶级分析，他用
  “唯成分论”的帽子来反对它；我们要无产阶级专政，他要帝王将相、地主、资产阶级重新统治人民；我们要发扬共产主义道德，他宣扬腐烂的封建道德、资产阶级道德；我们歌颂农民起义领袖，他歌颂海瑞、周忱。吴晗的观点同我们工人的观点水火不相容。”　　水利电力科学研究院工厂工人刘恒来稿说：“吴晗的思想，同我们背道而驰。我们要‘不忘剥削苦，牢记阶级仇’，他告诉我们受剥削也不要紧，有“清官”替我们作主。我们要走向社会主义，他要走资本主义。真是猖狂到了极点。我们要坚决打退吴晗的猖狂进攻。”
    许多工农兵来信指出，吴晗是资产阶级代言人，是个死心塌地走胡适道路的人。他的反党反人民的思想是一贯的。他们说：吴晗骂我们，不是偶然的。从《人民日报》揭发的两批材料来看，他几十年前就骂我们了，什么“流寇”啦，什么“一窝蜂”、
  “鸟兽散”啦。他骂了我们三十多年，过去是明目张胆地骂，现在是含沙射影地骂。现在该是我们反击的时候了。
    甘肃省天水市某厂工人马润和来稿说：吴晗以为他颠倒黑白，歪曲历史事实，可以迷惑我们工人阶级，可是事情出于他的意外。我们牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“在有阶级存在的社会内，阶级斗争不会完结。”吴晗再狡猾，也逃不过工人阶级的眼睛。
      拆穿吴晗的反党反社会主义手法
    工农兵来信来稿一致指出，在阶级斗争的新形势下，吴晗通过杂文、戏剧等形式，“以古喻今”，指桑骂槐，向党和社会主义进攻。我们必须拆穿吴晗的手法。吴晗抬出“清官”来，宣扬海瑞精神，企图模糊阶级界限，这是十分恶毒的。所谓“清官”，是封建地主阶级和他们的头子有意布设的大骗局。
    辽宁省锦州市女儿河造纸厂工人冯清江来信说：“吴晗硬说海瑞是站在穷人一边，替劳动人民说话的，这是撒谎。海瑞为封建地主阶级谋福利，给皇帝老儿卖命，他是剥削阶级的人，绝不会站在劳动人民一边。”包头市内蒙古一机厂工人范连仲来信说：“不管‘清官’、‘贪官’，他们都是官，他们的本质都是反动的。吴晗说海瑞‘站在人民方面，一生反对坏人坏事，从没有反对过好人好事’。这是睁眼说瞎话。海瑞是个双手沾满人民鲜血的反动家伙。吴晗却说他从没有反对过好人好事，真是想只手遮天！”
    辽宁省朝阳电业局工人孙志安来信说：“吴晗说海瑞不惜个人一切为劳动人民谋福利，这纯粹是对历史的歪曲。天下乌鸦一般黑，吴晗要为一般黑的乌鸦披上件五彩的外衣，是徒劳的。”
    解放军某部战士王玉卿来信说：“我不承认中国历史上的所谓‘清官’。‘清官’是反动剥削阶级抬出来的，是笑面虎，是腐蚀剂。我们今天要的是焦裕禄式的好干部，也只有在今天的社会里才会有焦裕禄式的好干部。我们彻底打倒了封建剥削阶级，我们也要彻底清除封建剥削阶级包括吴晗这样的人所散布的‘清官’的思想毒害。”
    坚决驳斥吴晗污蔑劳动人民的恶毒谰言
    工农兵来稿，还驳斥了吴晗污蔑劳动人民、歌颂帝王将相的谰言。黑龙江省桦南县农机厂青年工人田希全来信说：“吴晗说，在过去的历史时代里，起主导作用的是帝王将相，贫雇农一辈子没有什么成就。这真是莫大的污蔑！请问历史上哪一个工程建设、哪一项发明创造不是劳动人民的血汗结晶？正是农民起义农民战争推动了历史前进。吴晗站在地主立场上，替帝王将相争地位。他要续的是剥削阶级家谱。”
    河北邯郸兼庄公社王安堡大队知识青年李之枢来稿说：“数千年的中国史书，全是封建文人编写的。劳动人民被压制了几千年，人民群众在史书上被歪曲被丑化。一九六三年，一位老贫农双手捧着我们的村史，热泪盈眶地说：‘这才是咱贫下中农的史书呀！’我们今天无产阶级当了家作了主，就要用无产阶级观点重新写历史，把过去被象吴晗之流的封建文人颠倒了的历史，颠倒过来。”
        决不容许吴晗毒害青少年
    无产阶级要培养自己的革命接班人，资产阶级也在千方百计培养他们的反革命剥削事业的接班人。吴晗就是大力为资产阶级培养接班人的。许多工农兵来信对吴晗毒害青年一代甚至少年一代的反动行为表示愤慨。
    解放军某部战士张化荣来信说：“党和毛主席向来非常关心我们青年。毛主席把我们青年比作早晨八、九点钟的太阳，说：
  ‘希望寄托在你们身上’。可是资产阶级反动派的代表吴晗也把希望寄托在我们身上。吴晗到处毒害青年，散布个人奋斗，成名成家思想，要青年闭门读书，别参加政治运动，要克服一切困难，成为专家学者。一句话，要我们当资产阶级反革命接班人。告诉你，吴晗，我们青年决不听你那一套。我们坚决听毛主席的话，按照党指引的方向，作无产阶级革命事业接班人。”
    河北省丰南县尖字沽公社下双坨村社员张贺彤来稿说：“广大青年都响应毛主席的伟大号召，到农村这个广阔天地里去，同工农兵相结合，到三大革命斗争中去锻炼。这是‘好得很’。只有吴晗才骂我们，污蔑我们，说‘糟得很’。”
    河北省易县广播服务部无线电修理工人王福林来信说：“吴晗毒害青年，要青年闹个人英雄主义，什么都得依着自己。不听别人意见，拒绝别人批评，就是‘刚直不阿’，‘有骨气’。”
    内蒙古黄河工程局一处预制厂工人王允斌来信说：“我是一个产业工人，最最需要的是学习和运用毛泽东思想，来搞社会主义建设。吴晗反对我们学毛主席著作，这正说明我们做对了，我们越要加倍努力学习毛主席著作。”
      永远听毛主席的话，跟共产党走
    许多工农兵来信，谈起在旧社会所受的剥削，所受的封建主义和资本主义的压迫，说明只有党和毛主席才是人民的救星，只有跟着共产党走社会主义的光明大道，才能有真正幸福的生活。
    洛阳拖拉机锻造厂工人李来俊来信说：“在我们黄河北岸，解放前是白茫茫一片盐碱地，一棵庄稼不长，人民受灾受难。人民公社成立以后，挖河修渠，压住了盐碱，往日的荒凉白地变成了红土好地，绿油油的庄稼，真是河北变成了江南。我们由年年逃荒要饭，到如今的队队卖余粮，人人丰衣足食。这全是共产党毛主席的好领导带来的好光景。吴晗妄想变天，这不是白日做梦吗！”
    昌平十三陵公社西山口大队贫农刘德顺来稿说：“党和毛主席领导我们走上了公社化的道路，生活一天比一天好。现在我一想起单干那阵儿，心里就难过。毛主席把我们从火坑中救出来，我们贫下中农才真正挺起了腰板，过上了好日子。吴晗要想夺走我们的幸福，我们坚决跟他斗到底。”
    锦州铁路局郑家屯铁路工人张广录来信说：“我在五六岁的时候，父亲被织布工厂解雇，全家四口人吃不上饭。母亲刚生下我的小妹妹，为了生活，就卖掉了亲骨肉，去给人家奶孩子。我九岁就给地主扛活，当牛当马。有一次起五更给地主烧饭，火从灶门着出来，把腿烧伤，到现在阴天下雨还难受。吴晗极为恶毒地要把我们朝资本主义黑道上领，我们要彻底揭露他的恶毒阴谋。”
    解放军某部陈孝兴来稿说：“亲爱的党中央和毛主席是我们全国人民的大救星，心中的红太阳，伟大的社会主义是我们六亿五千万人民的命根子。我们打心眼里热爱党中央、热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义、热爱三面红旗。谁反对党，反对社会主义，就是反对中国人民，不管他是文的、武的、公开的、隐蔽的，我们都要同他拼！我们要正告吴晗，人民的江山是铁打的，是反不掉的。既然你向全国人民发起了挑战，那么，全国人民必将奋起迎战，坚决同你斗争到底！”
    广大工农兵来稿的显著特点是：阶级观点明确，政治热情饱满。每一篇都是爱憎分明，字里行间充满着对吴晗反党反社会主义的立场和思想的憎恨，充满着对党和毛主席的无限热爱。这些来稿都能抓住政治上的要害问题，一针见血地给以有力的批判。广大工农兵奋起声讨吴晗的反动言行，积极参加文化大革命斗争，这是我国思想战线上的一件令人兴奋的划时代的大事。
