    China is a Miracle
    —The Chinese Pavilion Once Again Becomes the Attraction Center of the Paris Exposition
    At this year's Paris Exposition, the Chinese Pavilion once again achieved great success. Many people, after visiting the Chinese Pavilion, enthusiastically praised the People's Republic of China as a great country and the Chinese people as a great people, and they cheered, "Long live the New China!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" Here, countless visitors not only saw exquisite exhibits, but also saw the spirited mental outlook of the New China. They praised from their hearts: "China is amazing, just like last year, it's number one again!" "A wonderful exhibition!" "Unforgettable for a lifetime!"
    Last year's Chinese Pavilion was comprehensive, reflecting a general overview of the New China's economic and cultural construction achievements. This year's Chinese Pavilion focuses on displaying arts and crafts, fully demonstrating the brilliant achievements made by Chinese arts and crafts with a long tradition in the seventeen years since liberation.
    Stepping into the gate of the Chinese Pavilion, one is greeted by a colorful, giant velvet embroidery "Six Hundred Million People Are All Like Yao and Shun," measuring seven meters wide. It embroidered representatives of China's more than fifty ethnic groups united around Chairman Mao. Here, many people couldn't help but stop and be attracted by this vivid embroidery.
    In the central hall and right hall, the most eye-catching are the giant velvet embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao and the velvet embroidered "Yan'an Torch" and tapestry "Great Wall of China". These two halls also exhibited various furniture, embroideries, ceramics, weavings, as well as feather paintings, wheat straw paintings, shell inlay paintings, art dolls, and so on.
    The live embroidery performance aroused great interest among the audience. When Zhu Aizhen, a Suzhou girl performing double-sided embroidery, was embroidering two lifelike kittens stitch by stitch, she was always surrounded by a large group of spectators. Especially French women watched with rapt attention. French men and women watched the live performance intently, marveling at this exquisite craftsmanship, and then constantly asked the young embroidery worker, cultivated since liberation, about her training and her family and life. Here, people not only recognized the high skills of Chinese arts and crafts, but also learned about the care and training of artists by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government.
    In the left hall, lacquerware, jewelry, metal crafts, jade, ivory carvings, and stone carvings are displayed. The most attractive to the audience is the two-meter-long, sixty-kilogram ivory carved with the story of the Long March. There is always a large crowd gathered here, some taking pictures, some listening with interest to the guide explaining the Long March of twenty-five thousand li.
    People not only appreciate traditional Chinese arts and crafts, but also love products that express new themes and use new artistic techniques. New themed products exhibited this time, such as the velvet embroidery "Yan'an Torch" and "Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station", ivory carving "Long March", stone carving "Plum Blossom", jade carving "Drinking Water from the Same River", etc., were all warmly welcomed by the audience.
    After seeing the exhibition, many viewers wrote words of praise and encouragement for Chinese arts and crafts and for New China on the guestbook with excitement: "It is unimaginable that mankind can create such good works!" "China is a miracle!" "Tradition and innovation, this is a symbol of a dynamic people!" "Today's China absorbs the traditions of its ancestors and makes art leap forward, which is admirable." "China always does its things very well and has unlimited prospects!" Many people enthusiastically wrote: "What a great country China is, supporting and sympathizing with China!" "Great country! Great people!" "Long live New China!" "Long live Mao Zedong!"
    Many French people also said that they had increased their understanding of China after seeing the exhibition. They wrote: "All this shatters the lies of the West." "After seeing the Chinese Pavilion, I took off my (colored) glasses, and I will no longer look at people through the crack of a door." Some people also wrote: "These exquisite works you exhibited are the creations of your country's workers and peasants."
    While admiring Chinese arts and crafts, people were full of emotion about the current decadent Western art, and they wrote: "This exhibition has given us some relief from the depressing Western civilization." "Your exhibition is a successful exhibition against the corrupt and abstract art of the West." "In the face of so many beautiful and outstanding crafts, we deeply regret the messy life in the West." Four Parisian sculptors also jointly signed to congratulate the Chinese artists.
    Occasionally, someone wrote a sentence in the guestbook that slandered China. But other viewers immediately filled the space next to it with words denouncing him with righteous indignation.
    Every day, moving scenes appear in the Chinese Pavilion. An old lady in her eighties came to visit despite her age. There are also some blind people who come to the Chinese Pavilion. They stroked some of the exhibits with their hands, revealing joy and admiration. After seeing the exhibition, a worker took the initiative to publicize it to his relatives and friends, urging them to visit the Chinese Pavilion. He said: "I want many people to go and see it, to write inscriptions, to say that China is good, and then I will be happy."
    The Chinese Pavilion has a small shop selling Chinese crafts and newspapers. After seeing the exhibition, many viewers are happy to buy one or two Chinese crafts as souvenirs.

    中国就是奇迹
    ——中国馆再度成为巴黎博览会的吸引中心
    在今年的巴黎博览会上，中国馆再一次获得了极大的成功。许多人在参观中国馆后热情地赞扬中华人民共和国是伟大的国家，中国人民是伟大的人民，并且欢呼“新中国万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”在这里，无数观众不仅看到精美的展品，而且看到了新中国意气风发的精神面貌。他们从心里赞扬说：“中国了不起，同去年一样，又是第一名。”“绝妙的展览！”“终生难忘！”
    去年的中国馆是综合性的，它反映了新中国经济、文化建设成就的概貌。今年的中国馆则集中展出了工艺美术品，充分显示了具有悠久传统的中国工艺美术在解放后十七年来所取得的辉煌成就。
    一踏进中国馆的大门，迎面就是一幅宽达七米的彩色巨幅绒绣
  “六亿神州尽舜尧”。它绣出了中国五十多个民族的代表团结在毛主席的周围。在这里，许多人都不由自主地停住了脚步，被这幅神采奕奕的绣象吸引住。
    在中厅和右厅，最令人注目的是巨幅绒绣毛主席象以及绒绣“延安火炬”和壁毯“万里长城”。这两个厅还展出了各种家具、刺绣品、陶瓷、编织品以及羽毛画、麦秆画、贝壳镶嵌画、美术人形等等。
    刺绣的现场表演引起观众的极大兴趣。当表演双面绣的苏州姑娘朱爱珍一针针地绣着两只栩栩如生的小猫时，她的身旁总是围着一大批观众。特别是法国妇女看得出神。法国男女观众一边聚精会神地观看现场表演，一边啧啧称道这种精湛的手艺，随后不断地向这位解放后培养出来的青年刺绣工作者问长问短，从刺绣手法的学习经过一直问到她的家庭和生活。在这里，人们既认识了中国工艺美术的高度技巧，也了解到中国共产党和中国政府对艺人的关怀和培养。
    在左厅里，陈列着漆器、首饰、金属工艺和玉器、牙刻、石刻等。最吸引观众的是整根雕刻着长征故事的长两米、重六十公斤的象牙。这里总是挤着一大圈人，有的照相，有的兴致勃勃地倾听解说员讲解二万五千里长征的经过。
    人们不仅欣赏中国传统的工艺美术品，而且也热爱表现新题材和运用新艺术手法的产品。这次展出的新题材产品如绒绣“延安火炬”和“新安江水电站”、牙刻“长征”、石刻“梅花”、玉刻“同饮一江水”等等，都受到观众热烈欢迎。
    许多观众在看完展览以后怀着激动的心情，在留言簿上写下了对中国工艺美术以及对新中国的赞扬和鼓励的话：“难以想象人类能创造出这样好的作品！”“中国就是奇迹！”“传统和革新，这是充满活力的人民的象征！”“今天的中国，汲取了祖先的传统，使艺术获得飞跃，令人倾倒。”“中国总是把它的事情做得极好，前途无量！”许多人热情地写道：“中国是一个多么了不起的国家，支持和同情中国！”“伟大的国家！伟大的人民！”“新中国万岁！”“毛泽东万岁！”
    许许多多法国人还表示，他们在看了展览以后增加了对中国的了解。他们写道：“这一切戳穿了西方的谎言。”“看了中国馆，我摘下了（有色）眼镜，我再不从门缝里看人了。”还有人写道：“你们展出的这些精美作品是贵国工人、农民的创造”。
    人们在赞赏中国工艺美术的同时，对当前颓废没落的西方艺术感慨万端，他们写道：“这一展览使我们从令人苦闷的西方文明中获得了某些解脱。”“你们的展览是一次成功的、反对西方腐朽抽象艺术的展览。”“在这样多的优美卓绝的工艺品面前，我们为西方乱糟糟的生活深感遗憾。”四个巴黎雕刻家还联合签名向中国艺术家表示祝贺。
    偶尔有人在留言簿上写了一句谩骂中国的话。但别的观众马上满腔义愤地在旁边写满了痛斥他的字句。
    每天，在中国馆里都有动人的场面出现。八十多岁的老太太也不顾年迈赶来参观。还有一些双目失明的人来到中国馆。他们用手抚摸一些展品，流露出高兴和钦佩的心情。一个工人看了展览之后，主动地向亲友进行宣传，劝他们去参观中国馆。他说：“我愿意很多人去看，去题字，讲中国好，我才高兴。”
    中国馆附设有中国工艺品和书报小卖部。许多观众看完展览以后，都乐意买上一两件中国工艺品留作纪念。
