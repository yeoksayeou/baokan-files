甲：Look, a clump of poisonous weeds grows in a bed of flowers,
乙：Look, a gust of black wind blows in the clear sky.
甲：A handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist black gangs,
乙：Launched an attack against the Party and the people!
甲：How can we workers allow them to spread poison!
乙：We workers have long been filled with anger!
合：Firmly stand at the forefront of the struggle, participate in the great revolution on the cultural front, with a hammer in one hand and a pen in the other, eradicate poisonous weeds, get rid of the black line, our bullets will hit the target every time!
甲：We can sweep away all dark clouds and mists,
乙：We can defeat all cold rain and evil winds!
合：Because we have Mao Zedong Thought, which serves as a magic mirror of the era for us; because we have Mao Zedong Thought, which illuminates our path forward. We, the worker-peasant-soldier masses, have truly become the vanguards of the cultural front.
甲：Remember Chairman Mao's teachings,
乙：Never forget class struggle!
乙：Contending with enemies who fire covert shots,
甲：This is by no means a trivial matter,
合：We must meet them tit-for-tat, and fight for every inch of ground!
甲：We workers,
乙：Guarantee to the Party:
合：Forever listen to Chairman Mao, stand firm! Forever follow the Party, never stop!
甲：We must turn the fighting pen into bombs to throw at the enemy;
乙：We must forge our boundless loyalty to the Party into sharp blades to stab the enemy!
合：Resolutely open fire on all black lines, resolutely smash the enemy's attack; hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away all pests; we will never withdraw until complete victory!
