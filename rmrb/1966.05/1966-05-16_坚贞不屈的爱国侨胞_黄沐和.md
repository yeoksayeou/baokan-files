    The anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities organized by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are becoming increasingly rampant. In April, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia was openly and savagely attacked by the Indonesian armed forces and thugs. Overseas Chinese organizations and schools in various parts of Indonesia have been illegally seized and destroyed one after another. Under the cruel persecution of the racist Indonesian right-wing military clique, the broad masses of overseas Chinese are living in dire straits.

    On April 8, the clutches of the Indonesian right-wing forces reached out to the Jakarta Chinese Associations Federation. Right-wing soldiers and thugs forcibly occupied the Federation's premises, kidnapped, and illegally interrogated Huang Muhe, an innocent executive of the Federation. Huang Muhe fainted several times under the brutal torture of the thugs, but he always responded with stern words and never yielded. Huang Muhe's staunch national integrity overwhelmed the reactionary arrogance of the right-wing military clique and thwarted their meticulously planned persecution plot.
          Standing Up Against the Thugs
    At a little after six o'clock on the morning of April 8, Huang Muhe, who was just over thirty years old and born in Indonesia, was engrossed in studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Since the Indonesian right-wing generals group launched a counter-revolutionary military coup and stirred up a counter-current of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment, Huang Muhe had been even more diligent in studying Chairman Mao's works. At half past seven in the morning, it was almost time for the Federation to start work. Suddenly, an American-made jeep, escorted a group of thugs calling themselves "Kabi" (short for "Indonesian Youth and Student Unified Action Organization"), broke into the iron gate of the Federation's premises.

    Wielding machetes, daggers, iron bars, and wooden sticks, the thugs forcibly entered the premises. They stormed into various offices, ransacking cabinets and chests, and robbing the Federation staff of their watches and clothing. They wrote "Ownership of the building belongs to 'Kami' (short for "Indonesian University Students Unified Action Organization") and 'Kabi' from 8:05 a.m. on April 8" and anti-China slogans such as "Hang the Chinamen" on the door and the walls of the room. The thugs used daggers to threaten the staff and overseas Chinese who came to the Federation to handle affairs, locking them in the rooms and conducting illegal interrogations one by one. Some overseas Chinese were searched, some were punched and kicked, and some were forced to stand facing the wall.

    Standing among the overseas Chinese staff, Huang Muhe stepped forward at this time and sternly questioned the thugs: "What are you doing here?"
    One of the thugs, a ringleader, said aggressively: "We are ordered to take over your property. Hand over the keys to the office!"
    "We are a legitimate Federation, you have no right to take over!" Huang Muhe said righteously.

    Although the thugs waved daggers and machetes and shouted loudly, they could not get the keys from the Federation's staff. The thugs then made wild accusations, saying that the Federation was engaged in illegal activities. Huang Muhe sternly refuted, "Our Federation is upright and honorable, and we have always supported the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism." He pointed out that the overseas Chinese have a deep friendship with the Indonesian people, and recently, when a flood occurred in Solo, the Federation donated money and sent clothes to the victims. The overseas Chinese have always lived in harmony with the Indonesian people.

    At this time, the thugs shouted, "Take him away!" Immediately, four thugs wielding weapons came up and forcibly took him away, ignoring Huang Muhe's resolute protests. He was kidnapped to a secret interrogation room set up in a Jakarta middle school, guarded by armed soldiers. The right-wing reactionary forces attempted to use this overseas Chinese to create an anti-China excuse to cover up their shameless crime of destroying the Federation.
          Crushing the Farce of Forced Interrogation
    A farce of forced interrogation began. Huang Muhe strode into a room and saw thugs holding short swords and bayonets, some with half their faces covered. Several thugs were "interrogating" an Indonesian "student," and while "beating" the "student," they shamelessly said to Huang Muhe: "We are doing this because someone is paying us! Do you know? Suharto Uncle is our protector!" Huang Muhe thought: The reactionaries are scaring me. They are fierce on the surface, but actually very timid. They are obviously afraid that others will see their true colors.

    When the thugs interrogated Huang Muhe, one of them pointed a knife at his chest and asked him many provocative questions. Huang Muhe refused to answer any of them. The thug then asked, "What is your attitude towards the 'September 30th' incident?" Huang Muhe replied simply, "I am a foreigner and do not interfere in your internal affairs." The thug took out a prepared note to the effect that the Chinese Association Federation was turning over the property and demanded that Huang Muhe sign it. Huang Muhe flatly refused. The thug asked, "Who can sign it?" Huang Muhe replied, "I don't know!"

    Huang Muhe was then taken to the second interrogation room next door. The atmosphere in this interrogation room was completely different. When the thugs saw Huang Muhe coming in, they bowed and scraped to greet him, and one of them respectfully brought tea and cigarettes. Huang Muhe thought: They're playing a new trick again. The thugs took out the note again and asked Huang Muhe to sign it. Huang Muhe only said one sentence, "I will not sign," and then ignored them.

    The thugs saw that Huang Muhe was calm and composed, neither drinking tea nor smoking cigarettes, and they lost their patience. They suddenly revealed their fierce faces and rushed up to push Huang Muhe into the third interrogation room.

    It was already eleven o'clock in the morning. A sign hung on the door of the third interrogation room, reading "Strictly Forbidden to Enter." Huang Muhe walked in with his head held high, only to see a gloomy scene inside. A person lay on the ground with his limbs outstretched, making pig-like howls. A thug roared, ordering the person lying on the ground to get up, and pointing to Huang Muhe, said to that person: "Turn this person over to you for interrogation. Let's see your skills!"
    Huang Muhe took a closer look and realized that the guy who got up from the ground was the "student" who had been "interrogated" and "beaten" in the first interrogation room. That guy quickly got up and pleaded with Huang Muhe: "Sign it quickly! If you don't sign, you'll be beaten like me. If you sign, you'll be free!"

    Huang Muhe saw that this guy was dressed like a gangster and had no injuries on his body. He quickly realized: This is a trap set by the enemy! He became vigilant and ignored it completely. That guy quickly revealed the face of a fascist bandit, flew into a rage, and slapped Huang Muhe repeatedly. Another thug then rushed in front of Huang Muhe, held a dagger to Huang Muhe's throat, and roared: "Do you want to live or die?"
        Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings
    Faced with the thugs' threats, Huang Muhe thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai." He also thought of Wu Pengde and Li Huanquan, the overseas Chinese staff of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta who had upheld their national integrity under the guns of the right-wing soldiers, and the nine comrades who had fought against the reactionaries in Brazil for more than a year. At this time, Huang Muhe was calm and composed. He resolved to do as Chairman Mao said, and he would rather sacrifice himself than yield to the reactionaries. He glared angrily at the thugs and replied: "Kill me or beat me, do as you please! I will not sign!" Four other thugs standing beside him rushed up and took turns beating Huang Muhe, some punching him in the chest and abdomen, some kicking his lower body, and some hitting his knees with wooden sticks. Huang Muhe fainted several times, but he stood up stubbornly again and again. He thought that the more fiercely the thugs beat him, the more it proved that he was doing the right thing. He could not have any illusions about the reactionaries. Persisting in the struggle would surely lead to victory.

    A fat thug in his thirties flashed in, and the other thugs retreated to the side. Huang Muhe saw that this thug was bare-chested, with a chest full of black hair, wearing grass-green military trousers, and immediately realized that this guy was not a "student." The thug came up and took Huang Muhe's hand, handed him a pen, and attempted to force Huang Muhe to sign. Huang Muhe pushed the pen aside and shouted loudly: "Even if you beat me to death, I will not sign!" The exasperated thug then shamelessly stripped off Huang Muhe's clothes, leaving only a pair of shorts, and then punched Huang Muhe's chest forcefully, asking Huang Muhe if he would sign as he beat him. The thugs further threatened him, saying that he had received communist education, that he was serving the Chinese Communist Party, and that they would bury him alive at night. Huang Muhe had long since put life and death out of his mind. At this time, he only had one thought: As a Chinese living abroad, he must never bring disgrace to the great motherland! He must never lose his national integrity! He gritted his teeth, glared at the thugs, and said nothing more.
          Heroically and Unyieldingly Resisting the Adverse Current
    It was already past five o'clock in the afternoon. In the face of the enemy's torture, Huang Muhe had waged a heroic struggle for more than eight hours, making the thugs helpless. The thugs ran out to make a phone call. A few minutes later, three armed soldiers appeared openly and took Huang Muhe out of the interrogation room.

    When Huang Muhe passed the first interrogation room, he saw that the thugs were illegally interrogating some overseas Chinese who had been unreasonably detained. He immediately exposed the process by which the right-wing soldiers and thugs had used various means to harm him, and strongly protested to the military authorities against the fascist crimes of infringing on the human rights of overseas Chinese. At this time, the soldiers and thugs present stood aside, speechless. Huang Muhe was taken to the Northern Command of the Fifth Military District in Jakarta. Through the solemn representations of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and Huang Muhe's heroic and tenacious struggle, the right-wing military clique had no choice but to release him.

    The only result of the Indonesian right-wing military clique's kidnapping and beating of a Chinese national was that it once again exposed their ugly fascist faces.

    Recently, Huang Muhe, who grew up in Indonesia, returned to the capital of the motherland for the first time, and was warmly welcomed and cordially comforted by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and the people of the capital. This patriotic overseas Chinese shed tears of emotion when he met his compatriots. While exposing the crimes of the Indonesian right-wing military clique in persecuting overseas Chinese, he said: "Chairman Mao's words gave me strength to wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries. In the anti-China and anti-Chinese counter-current in Indonesia, we overseas Chinese can stand firm and withstand it, because behind us, there is an increasingly powerful socialist motherland, and 650 million great people of the motherland armed with Mao Zedong Thought."　Xinhua News Agency Reporter

    坚贞不屈的爱国侨胞——黄沐和
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的反华排华暴行，越来越猖狂。四月，中国驻印度尼西亚的大使馆，公然遭到印度尼西亚武装部队和暴徒的野蛮袭击，印度尼西亚各地的华侨团体和华侨学校，相继被非法侵占和破坏。在印度尼西亚右派军人集团的种族主义的残酷迫害下，广大华侨正处在水深火热之中。
    四月八日，印度尼西亚右派势力的魔掌，伸向雅加达中华侨团总会，右派军人和暴徒强行霸占了总会会所，绑架和非法刑讯无辜的侨团总会干事黄沐和。黄沐和在暴徒的严刑拷打下，几次昏迷，但他始终严词相对，绝不屈服。黄沐和以自己坚贞不屈的民族正气，压倒了右派军人集团的反动气焰，挫败了他们精心策划的迫害阴谋。
          挺身而出拒暴徒
    四月八日清晨六时多，刚满三十岁的出生在印度尼西亚的黄沐和，正在聚精会神地学习《毛泽东选集》。自从印度尼西亚右派将领集团发动反革命军事政变，掀起反华排华的逆流之后，黄沐和对毛主席著作的学习更加勤奋了。早晨七时半，侨团总会上班的时间快到了。突然，一辆美国造的吉普车，护送着一群自称“卡比”（即“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”）的暴徒，闯进了侨团总会会所的大铁门。
    手持砍刀、匕首、铁棒、木棍的暴徒，强行进入会所。他们窜进各个办公室，翻箱倒柜，抢走侨团总会工作人员的手表和衣物。他们在大门和室内墙壁上涂写“从四月八日八时零五分起房屋主权属‘卡米’（即“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”）、‘卡比’”的字样和“吊死支那人”等反华标语。暴徒们用匕首威胁着把工作人员和来会所办理事务的华侨关押到房子里，逐一进行非法审讯。有的华侨被搜身，有的被拳打脚踢，有的被强行面壁罚站。
    站在华侨工作人员中间的黄沐和，这时挺身而出，厉声责问暴徒：“你们到这里来干什么？”
    暴徒中的一个头目气势汹汹地说：“我们奉命来接管你们的房产，快把办公室的钥匙交出来！”
    “我们是合法的侨团，你们无权接管！”黄沐和理直气壮地说。
    尽管暴徒们挥着匕首、砍刀大叫大嚷，但是暴徒们却无法从侨团总会工作人员手中获得钥匙。暴徒们接着大肆诬蔑，说什么侨团搞非法活动。黄沐和义正词严地驳斥道，“我们侨团正大光明，我们一向支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争”。他指出，华侨同印度尼西亚人民有着深厚的友谊，最近梭罗地方发生水灾，侨团总会还给灾民捐了钱，送了衣服。华侨同印度尼西亚人民一贯是友好相处的。
    这时，暴徒们狂喊“把他带走！”随即上来四个手持凶器的暴徒，不顾黄沐和的坚决抗议，强行把他带走了。他被绑架到有武装军人把守的私设在雅加达中学的秘密审讯室里。右派反动势力妄图利用这位华侨制造反华的借口，掩盖他们破坏侨团总会的无耻罪行。
          粉碎逼讯的丑剧
    一场逼讯丑剧开始了。黄沐和昂然走进一个房间，看到这里的暴徒拿着短剑、刺刀，有的用布蒙住半个脸。几个暴徒正在“审讯”一个印度尼西亚“学生”，暴徒们一面“打”这个“学生”，一面无耻地对黄沐和说：“我们这样做，是有人给钱的！你知道吗？苏哈托伯伯就是我们的保护人！”黄沐和心想：反动派是在吓唬我，他们表面上凶狠，实际上十分怯弱，他们显然怕别人识破自己的真面目。
    暴徒逼讯黄沐和的时候，一个暴徒用刀指着他的胸口，向他提出许多挑衅性的问题，黄沐和全部拒绝回答。暴徒又问道：“你对‘九卅’事件的态度如何？”黄沐和干脆地回答说：“我是外侨，不过问你们的内政问题。”暴徒拿出一份打好字的所谓移交中华侨团总会房屋的字条，要黄沐和在上面签字。黄沐和断然地拒绝了。暴徒问：“你说谁能签字？”黄沐和回答“不知道！”
    黄沐和又被带进隔壁的第二个审讯室。这个审讯室完全是另一种气氛。暴徒们看见黄沐和进来了，点头哈腰地迎上来，一个暴徒毕恭毕敬地端来了茶和烟。黄沐和心想：又耍新的花招了。暴徒又拿出字条来，要黄沐和签字。黄沐和只说了一句“我不签”，就再也不理睬他们了。
    暴徒们看到黄沐和镇定自若，一不喝茶，二不抽烟，他们沉不住气了，一下子现出满脸凶相，冲上来把黄沐和推进了第三个审讯室。
    这时已经是上午十一点。第三个审讯室的门上挂着一个牌子，写着“严禁入内”。黄沐和昂首挺胸地走了进去，只见室内一片阴森。一个人伸开四肢，躺在地上，发出猪一般的嚎叫声。一个暴徒狂吼着命令躺在地上的那个人爬起来，指着黄沐和对那个人说：“把这个人交给你审，看你的本领吧！”
    黄沐和定睛一看，原来那个从地上爬起来的家伙，就是在第一审讯室被暴徒“审讯”和“打”过的那个“学生”。那家伙一骨碌爬起来，就向黄沐和哀求说：“你快签字吧！不签字，就要象我一样挨打了。签了字，你就自由了！”
    黄沐和看见这个家伙是阿飞打扮，身上没有一点伤痕，很快就想到：这是敌人设下的圈套！他警惕起来，根本不予理睬。那个家伙很快露出法西斯匪徒的面目，暴跳如雷，连着打黄沐和的耳光。另一个暴徒紧接着窜到黄沐和面前，用一把匕首顶着黄沐和的喉咙吼叫：“你要死还是要活？”
        记住毛主席的教导
    黄沐和在暴徒们的威胁面前，想起了毛主席的教导：“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所”。他还想到在右派军人枪口下坚持民族气节的中国驻雅加达总领事馆的华侨工作人员吴朋德、李焕权，想到在巴西同反动派斗争一年多的九位同志。这时，黄沐和镇定自若，他下定决心照毛主席的话去做，宁可牺牲，也绝不向反动派屈服。他怒目回答暴徒说：“要杀要打，随你们的便！字，我是不签的！”站在旁边的另外四个暴徒，扑上来围着黄沐和轮番毒打，有的用拳头猛击他的胸部和腹部，有的用脚踢他的下体，有的用木棍敲击他的膝盖。黄沐和几次被打得昏迷过去，但是他一次又一次地顽强地站立起来。他想，暴徒越是凶恶地毒打自己，正是说明自己完全做得对，对反动派不能抱任何幻想，坚持斗争，一定能胜利。
    一个三十多岁的肥胖的暴徒闪了进来，其他的暴徒都退到一边。黄沐和看到这暴徒赤着上身，满胸黑毛，穿着草绿色的军人裤，一眼就看出这家伙不是什么“学生”。那暴徒上来拉着黄沐和的手，递过去一枝钢笔，妄图强迫黄沐和签字。黄沐和把钢笔推到一边，大声喝道：“你们就是打死我，我也不签字！”气急败坏的暴徒，这时无耻地剥掉了黄沐和的衣服，只剩下一条短裤，然后用拳头大力锤击黄沐和的胸部，一面打，一面问黄沐和签不签字。暴徒们进一步发出恐吓，说他受了共产主义教育，说他是在为中国共产党服务，声称要在夜里把他活埋掉。黄沐和早已把生死置之度外，他这时只有一个念头：作为一个侨居国外的中国人，决不给伟大的祖国丢脸！决不失掉民族的气节！他咬牙怒视着暴徒，再也不说话。
          英勇不屈抗逆流
    这时已是下午五时多。在敌人的酷刑面前，黄沐和进行了八个多小时的英勇斗争，使得暴徒无可奈何。暴徒们跑出去打电话，几分钟后，三个武装军人公开出场，把黄沐和带出了审讯室。
    当黄沐和走过第一审讯室的时候，看到暴徒正在非法审讯被无理拘留的一些华侨，便当场大声揭露右派军人和暴徒用各种手段残害自己的经过，并向军方强烈抗议侵犯华侨人权的法西斯罪行。这时，在场的军人和暴徒站在一边，哑口无言。黄沐和被带到雅加达第五军区北区司令部。经过中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的严正交涉，和黄沐和英勇顽强的斗争，右派军人集团不得不释放了他。
    印度尼西亚右派军人集团绑架和毒打一个中国侨民，得到的唯一结果是，又一次暴露了他们丑恶的法西斯嘴脸。
    最近，在印度尼西亚长大的黄沐和，第一次回到了祖国首都，受到华侨事务委员会、全国侨联和首都人民的热烈欢迎和亲切慰问。这位爱国华侨在见到祖国亲人的时候，激动得流下了眼泪。他在揭露印度尼西亚右派军人集团迫害华侨的罪行时说：“我和印度尼西亚反动派进行针锋相对的斗争，是毛主席的话给了我力量。在印度尼西亚的反华排华逆流中，我们华侨站得稳，顶得住，因为在我们的身后，有一个日益强大的社会主义祖国，有站立起来的用毛泽东思想武装的六亿五千万伟大祖国的人民。”　新华社记者
