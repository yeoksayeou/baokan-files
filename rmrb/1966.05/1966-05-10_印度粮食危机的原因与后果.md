Title: The Causes and Consequences of the Indian Food Crisis

    The current food crisis in India is the third and most severe since its independence. Among the fifteen states in India, ten have been affected by disasters or are facing severe food shortages. Indian officials openly admit a shortage of 14 million to 15 million tons this year, while American official newspapers estimate a shortage of 19 million to 22 million tons. In comparison, the 1951 crisis saw a shortage of 9 million tons, and the 1958 crisis a shortage of 6.7 million tons.

    The fundamental reason for India's continuous and increasingly severe food crises is that feudal land relations severely restrict agricultural productivity. The cruel exploitation by feudal landlords deprives the vast majority of peasants of any incentive to produce, let alone improve production techniques. The increasing impoverishment of the vast majority of peasants makes it impossible for them to improve production. In the seventeen years after 1947, grain production decreased or stagnated in eleven years. Even in normal years, half of India's population is undernourished, and half of the deaths are due to starvation.

    The reasons for this unprecedented food crisis also include the large-scale dumping of American grain, which has severely hit domestic grain production in India. Because the Indian government has always used the import of American grain as a means to stabilize grain prices, grain prices have consistently lagged behind the prices of other crops, and wheat prices (wheat being the main imported grain) have lagged behind the prices of other food crops. This situation has led to a continuous reduction in grain acreage. For example, in the 1963-1964 fiscal year, grain acreage decreased by 1.84 million hectares, accounting for approximately 1.7 percent of the total grain acreage in India.

    Secondly, severe natural disasters have caused poor harvests, while the Congress Party government has turned a blind eye to natural disasters. Eighty percent of India's cultivated land lacks irrigation and drainage facilities, making it impossible to resist natural disasters. The Congress Party government only focuses on extorting peasants and does not pay attention to the development of agricultural production, resulting in increasingly poor agricultural production and increasingly severe food crises.

    In addition, the Congress Party government implements a policy of military expansion and war preparation, intensifying the plunder of peasants. Taking land tax as an example, it has almost doubled since 1962. Heavy taxes accelerate the bankruptcy of peasants, making them even less able to develop production.

    This food crisis has a profound impact on India's entire national economy, domestic political situation, and foreign policy.

    Rising grain prices have led to a general rise in prices, further inflating the currency and greatly devaluing it. The food crisis has also exacerbated the foreign exchange crisis. Although buying American grain does not require foreign exchange, freight still needs to be paid in foreign exchange. Every million tons of American grain imported costs 12 million US dollars in foreign exchange. This is a huge pressure on India's dwindling foreign exchange reserves. Without solving the food problem, industry cannot develop. The 1966-1967 budget has already stipulated that new industrial projects are generally not allowed, and factories that rely on imported raw materials and parts to maintain production are also experiencing large-scale shutdowns and production cuts.

    The Indian government has been relying on importing American grain to solve the food crisis, which has not only damaged its own grain production and made the food shortage more severe, but also created a great opportunity for the United States to further control India. In the past six months, the United States has repeatedly used the food crisis to exert pressure on India. Recently, the American *Wall Street Journal* bluntly stated that because "India is dependent on Washington for survival... in the future, every form of American aid to India must be conditional on New Delhi implementing political and economic reforms." In order to beg for "aid," the Congress Party government will inevitably pursue a reactionary policy of relying on American imperialism.

    Under the impact of the food crisis, the contradictions between the people and the Congress Party's reactionary rule are becoming increasingly acute. Since the beginning of this year, anti-hunger struggles have been emerging one after another, characterized by their momentum, scale, and duration. The Congress Party government is increasingly brutally suppressing the people's anti-hunger struggles with force, but the result can only further intensify class contradictions in India and make the people's anti-hunger struggles intensify.

    印度粮食危机的原因与后果
    目前印度的粮食危机是独立以来的第三次，也是最严重的一次粮食危机。现在全印度十五个邦中，已有十个邦受灾或严重缺粮。印度官方公开承认今年缺粮一千四百万吨至一千五百万吨，美国官方报刊则估计缺一千九百万吨至二千二百万吨。而一九五一年危机时缺粮九百万吨，一九五八年危机时缺粮六百七十万吨。
    印度粮食危机之所以连绵不断，而且越来越严重，其根本原因是封建土地关系严重地束缚着农业生产力。封建地主的残酷剥削，使广大农民毫无生产积极性，更谈不上生产技术的改进；广大农民的日益赤贫化，使他们根本没有能力提高生产。在一九四七年以后的十七年中，就有十一年粮食生产减低或停滞。即使在正常年景，印度也有一半人口食不果腹，在死亡的人口中，有半数是由于饥馑。
    造成这次空前的粮食危机的原因还有，美国粮食大量倾销，严重地打击了印度国内的粮食生产。由于印度政府一向以进口美国粮食作为平抑粮价的手段，因此粮价一直落在其他农作物价格之后，而小麦价格（进口粮食中主要是小麦）更落在其他粮食作物价格之后。这种情况造成了粮田面积的不断减少。如一九六三——一九六四年度粮田面积就减少了一百八十四万公顷，约占全印度粮田总面积的百分之一点七。
    其次，严重的自然灾害造成农业歉收，而国大党政府对自然灾害则置若罔闻。印度全国百分之八十的耕地没有水利排灌设施，对于自然灾害毫无办法抵抗。国大党政府只顾搜刮农民，而不重视农业生产的发展，结果使农业生产越来越糟，粮食危机也随之而越来越严重。
    此外，国大党政府实行扩军备战政策，加紧掠夺农民。仅以土地税而言，一九六二年以来就几乎增加了一倍。苛捐杂税加速了农民的破产，农民更加无力发展生产。
    这次粮食危机，对印度的整个国民经济，国内政局和内外政策有着十分深刻的影响。
    由于粮价上涨引起物价普遍上涨，使通货更加膨胀，货币大大贬值。粮食危机也加剧了外汇危机。买美国粮食虽不用外汇，但运费仍需用外汇支付。每进口一百万吨美国粮食就要花一千二百万美元的外汇。这对日趋枯竭的印度外汇储备，是个巨大的压力。粮食问题解决不了，工业也发展不了。一九六六——一九六七年度预算已经规定一般不准建设新的工业项目，同时，依赖进口原料和零件维持生产的工厂也大量停工减产。
    印度政府一直用依靠进口美国粮食的办法来解决粮食危机，其结果不但破坏了本国的粮食生产，使粮荒更加严重，而且给美国进一步控制印度造成大好机会。近半年来，美国一再利用粮食危机对印度施加压力。最近美国《华尔街杂志》就曾露骨地说，由于“印度是依赖华盛顿而生存的……今后美国对印度的每种形式的援助都必须以新德里实施政治和经济改革为条件”。国大党政府为了乞取“援助”，就必然要奉行投靠美帝国主义的反动政策。
    在粮食危机的冲击下，人民群众同国大党反动统治的矛盾日趋尖锐。今年以来，反饥饿斗争彼伏此起，其特点是来势猛、规模大、持续时间长。对于人民的反饥饿斗争，国大党政府正在越来越残暴地进行武力镇压，但是其结果只能使印度国内的阶级矛盾更加激化，使人民反饥饿斗争愈演愈烈。　　（荣久）
