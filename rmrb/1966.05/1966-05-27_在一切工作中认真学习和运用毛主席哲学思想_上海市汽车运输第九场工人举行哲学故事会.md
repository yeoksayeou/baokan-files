    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 25th (Dispatch) – Workers from the Shanghai No. 9 Automobile Transportation Team recently held a lively philosophy storytelling session. The workers shared many practical philosophies from their work and lives at the meeting, demonstrating their excellent understanding and application of Mao Zedong's philosophical thought. This fully illustrates that once Mao Zedong's philosophical thought is grasped by the masses, it transforms into an immensely powerful material force.

    Part and Whole
    At the beginning of the storytelling session, squad leader and driver Song Qichang took the lead. He said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works has enabled me to understand that in any work, one must stand tall, see far, and first see the whole picture, the overall situation, and handle the relationship between the part and the whole well. As transportation workers, if we don't see the overall picture of industrial and agricultural production and serving the people's livelihood, we cannot do a good job in transportation production."

    "On the day before the Spring Festival this year, our squad's six vehicles were assigned to transport pork from the non-staple food company early in the morning. To meet the needs of the citizens to celebrate the Spring Festival, the stores extended the time for supplying pork. Our task was to distribute the pork to various supply points."

    "After a day of intense work, we completed the task of delivering meat, and it was almost time to get off work. However, at that time, the stores were still supplying pork, and it was very likely that we would be asked to transport pork to various supply points again. Should we go home to celebrate New Year's Eve, or should we stay a little longer? We thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: 'A Communist Party member must understand the principle of subordinating the needs of the part to the needs of the whole. If a certain opinion seems feasible in the local situation but not feasible in the overall situation, the part should be subordinate to the whole.' Now the situation was before us: our six vehicles were the part, and the market supply was the whole. From the perspective of the part, our task was completed, and we could leave; from the perspective of the whole, to ensure that the majority of citizens could buy fresh meat, there might be a phone call at any time asking us to transport it. When the part and the whole contradict each other, the part should be subordinate to the whole."

    "Everyone unified their understanding: it was a small matter for us to go home for New Year's Eve dinner, and a big matter to ensure the supply for the citizens. So, we decided not to leave and stick to our posts. Sure enough, before long, the phone rang. We were asked to urgently transport seven truckloads of pork to various supply stores. Everyone immediately went into battle and completed the task in time. Although we returned late, we felt very happy thinking that more residents could buy fresh meat in time."

    Seeing with Eyes vs. Doing with Hands

    As soon as Song Qichang finished speaking, driver Sun Naifa immediately stood up and said: "I'd like to talk about the story of learning to repair cars. Chairman Mao's 'On Practice' made me understand that seeing with eyes is not as good as doing with hands. I followed Chairman Mao's instructions and gradually learned the techniques of minor repairs, progressing from ignorance to knowledge."

    "I am a three-wheeled vehicle driver. In the past, I only knew how to drive, but not how to repair. Whenever the vehicle broke down during transportation, I would invariably 'break down, make a phone call, and rely on technicians for repairs,' which inevitably delayed the timely completion of production tasks. Seeing that some drivers in the team could adjust and repair their own vehicles, making them powerful, fuel-efficient, and without delaying time, I was very envious. So, I wanted to learn how to repair cars. How to learn? Initially, I couldn't grasp the essentials, only watching without doing. Although I watched a lot, I just couldn't learn it."

    "Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, my thinking was enlightened. Chairman Mao said: 'If you want to know the taste of a pear, you have to change the pear and eat it yourself.' I thought, why can others learn it, but I can't? It turned out that I didn't do it myself. Finding the reason, I was determined to start with the convenient ones and ask others if I didn't understand. With the enthusiastic help of my comrades, I used the time before and after work to disassemble and assemble, and do it myself. Once, I drove out to load goods, and after loading, the vehicle wouldn't start. I checked step by step according to the techniques I had learned, and found that there was oil on the points of the distributor and the fuel injection pipe of the carburetor was blocked. After I repaired these problems, I pressed the starter switch, and the car started. I felt indescribably happy."

    "The process of learning minor car repairs has made me understand a principle: seeing with eyes is not as good as doing with hands. To realize the leap from the 'realm of necessity' to the 'realm of freedom,' one must do it oneself. Learning to repair cars is like this, and doing other things is also like this."

    Small Accounts vs. Big Accounts

    Tire worker Jiang Xiaoguan then told a story about how only calculating small accounts could lead to big losses.

    He said: "One day, while inspecting tires, I found that a tire on a car had some small cracks. At that time, I thought it didn't matter much. It was an old tire, so it could run for another day and earn another day's worth of money, and anyway, it wouldn't lose money, so I let it run!"

    "A few days later, I received a call from the driver from outside, saying that the tire had exploded, the car had broken down, and they needed emergency repairs. I rushed to the scene and saw that the exploded tire was the one I had seen with some small cracks a few days ago. It turned out that although the cracks on the tire were small, they gradually expanded after running for a few days, and finally exploded with a 'bang.' The car broke down on the road, not only could the transportation task not be completed in time, but the team also had to send a repair vehicle to the scene to deliver a tire, which would cost a lot of gasoline, causing unnecessary losses. I originally thought that not repairing the small cracks was quite cost-effective, but it turned out to be very uneconomical! Seeing this situation, I felt very sad."

    "This incident made me understand a principle: advantages and disadvantages are a unity of opposites, and they can transform into each other under certain conditions. The so-called cost-effective or uneconomical must be viewed comprehensively. When we do things, we must not only see the immediate interests, but also the future development interests. We must calculate big accounts, not just small accounts, and not be greedy for temporary gains. Some things, from a local perspective, are quite cost-effective, but from an overall perspective, they are very uneconomical. If we only calculate local small accounts and not overall big accounts, we will suffer big losses. Accepting this lesson, whenever I encounter a tire with some damage, I will promptly remove it and repair it, which not only greatly extends the service life of the tire, but also ensures the timely completion of transportation tasks."

    Good and Bad

    Squad leader and driver Lu Junchang then said: "Jiang Xiaoguan said that contradictions can be transformed under certain conditions, which is very true. We are not afraid of encountering problems or failures, but we are afraid of getting discouraged."

    "One day in April two years ago, a car in our squad was not careful when reversing at a glass factory and broke the front corner light, and we didn't get the overall victory in the second quarter. This incident once affected the enthusiasm of the comrades in the squad. Some complained, and some were discouraged. To clarify our thinking and improve our understanding, I organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: 'Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results.' During the study, everyone used Chairman Mao's philosophical thought as a weapon to summarize and check the experience and lessons of the accident. Some said: 'A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit. It is not terrible to have an accident, what is terrible is to be discouraged.' Some said: 'Learn a lesson from a loss. As long as we truly learn from the lessons in driving in the future, we can turn failure into success.' Everyone believed that our fundamental purpose of safe driving is to protect the safety of the people's lives and property, not to win the victory. Since the accident has already happened, the main thing is to learn from the lessons and prevent the accident from happening again, so that we can turn bad things into good things. If we are dispirited because of an accident and refuse to learn from the lessons of the accident, then a bigger accident may occur, making bad things worse. Therefore, we should use this accident of breaking the corner light as a warning in our minds, drive with a high sense of responsibility to the people, and ensure driving safety." Since then, the comrades have been full of confidence, everyone has kept the lesson of this accident in mind, and every time they reverse or turn around, they think of the broken corner light, and drive cautiously at all times."

    "With the efforts of the comrades, our squad has maintained collective safe driving continuously from then until now, and has never had a similar accident. This year, we were also rated as a Five-Good Collective."

    Difficult and Easy

    Driver Zhang Wenlian, from the comparison of two events, realized the key to ensuring safety in transportation and loading and unloading work, which also gave people a lot of inspiration.

    "Once, I was loading canned food. The cans were placed in boxes, which were not heavy, and the boxes were very smooth. He thought that this kind of cargo was easy to load, so why bother wearing gloves? So, he loaded and unloaded barehanded. Unexpectedly, the tinplate of one box was not wrapped properly, and a corner popped out of the box, cutting a gash in his hand, and blood flowed. Another time, he loaded a batch of broken glass. This kind of broken glass was sharp, and he could cut his hand if he was not careful. But he took it seriously, not only wearing canvas gloves, but also padding with a piece of old cloth, and as a result, he completed the task smoothly."

    Zhang Wenlian said: "The two loading and unloading tasks have given me a lesson, that is, we must take everything seriously. The two sides of the contradiction will transform into each other under certain conditions, and so is the loading and unloading work. There are factors of difficulty in the easy loading, and factors of easy loading in the difficult loading. If we are serious in our thinking, difficult goods can also be loaded well without accidents; on the contrary, if we have the idea of seeking simplicity, even easy goods will have accidents, large or small."

    External Cause and Internal Cause

    Next, car captain and loader Wang Jinhong talked about "how bad people try to take advantage of me." He had just been discharged from the army and became a loader. He once regarded a bad element who pretended to be "honest," "active," and "caring" as a "good" friend. This bad element saw that Wang Jinhong was a little uneasy about the loading and unloading work, so he said to him: "You should choose a job with a future. There is no future in being a loader." He also often spread the idea of "life is about eating, drinking, and having fun" to Wang Jinhong. Later, Wang Jinhong studied Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle, became vigilant about this bad element, and, together with the masses, exposed and criticized his reactionary words and deeds.

    Wang Jinhong was greatly educated by this incident. He said: "Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and dialectical materialism make people red-hearted and bright-eyed. After studying Chairman Mao's philosophical thought, I understood the relationship between external and internal causes, and understood how bad people try to take advantage of me. Chairman Mao said: 'Dialectical materialism believes that external causes are the conditions of change, internal causes are the basis of change, and external causes play a role through internal causes.' As the saying goes, 'Flies don't bite seamless eggs.' It turned out that because there were individualistic mildew spots in my thinking, the enemy saw this point, took advantage of the gap, and took an inch, but I lost my vigilance and couldn't see his reactionary essence, and even once regarded him as a 'good' friend, which is so dangerous! Chairman Mao taught us: Never forget class struggle. In socialist society, although the reactionary ruling class has been overthrown by us, they are not reconciled, and they will take more hidden and cunning methods to attack us. This person mixed into the loading and unloading team, and his 'help,' 'care,' etc. were all a means for him to carry out class struggle. If we want to be able to timely see through the conspiratorial sabotage activities of class enemies in this sharp and complex class struggle, we must first seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, eliminate the 'mildew spots' in our thinking, and establish the proletarian world outlook of serving the people wholeheartedly."

### 在一切工作中认真学习和运用毛主席哲学思想  上海市汽车运输第九场工人举行哲学故事会

    在一切工作中认真学习和运用毛主席哲学思想
    上海市汽车运输第九场工人举行哲学故事会
    新华社上海二十五日电　上海市汽车运输第九场的工人最近举行了一次生动活泼的哲学故事会。工人们在会上讲了很多工作中、生活中的活哲学，表明他们对毛主席的哲学思想学得很好，运用得也很好，充分说明毛主席的哲学思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成无比强大的物质力量。
    局部与整体
    故事会一开始，小队长、驾驶员宋其昌就当了“开路先锋”。他说：学了毛主席著作，使我懂得做任何工作都要站得高，看得远，首先看到整体，看到全局，处理好局部和整体的关系。象我们运输工人，如果看不到工农业生产和为人民生活服务这个全局，就不可能搞好运输生产。
    今年春节前一天，我们小队六部车子一早到副食品公司担负装运猪肉的任务。为了满足市民欢度春节的需要，商店延长供应猪肉的时间。我们的任务是把猪肉分运各供应点。
    经过一天的紧张劳动，我们完成了送肉的任务，到了快要下班的时候了。可是，当时商店里还在供应猪肉，很可能还要我们装运猪肉给各供应点。是回家过年三十夜去呢，还是再留一会儿？我们想起了毛主席的教导：“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。如果某项意见在局部的情形看来是可行的，而在全局的情形看来是不可行的，就应以局部服从全局。”现在事情摆在面前，我们六部车子是局部，市场供应是整体。从局部来说，我们的任务完成了，可以走了；从全局来看，为了保证广大市民能够买到鲜肉，随时都可能有电话来叫我们装运。局部和整体发生矛盾，局部应当服从整体。
    大家统一了认识：我们回家吃年夜饭是小事，保证市民的供应是大事。于是决定不走，坚守岗位。果然不多时，电话铃响了。要我们急运七车猪肉送往各供应店。大家马上投入战斗，及时完成了任务。虽然回场迟了，但是想到更多的居民能及时买到鲜肉，我们心里非常愉快。
    眼看与手干
    宋其昌话音刚落，驾驶员孙乃发马上站起来说：我来谈一谈学习修车的故事。毛主席的《实践论》使我懂得，眼看不如手干。我照着毛主席的指示去做，由不懂到懂，逐步学会了小修的技术。
    我是三轮汽车驾驶员。以前我只会开车，不会修理，在运输途中碰到车子坏了，照例是“抛锚打电话，修理靠技工”，这样就势必耽误生产任务的及时完成。看看车队里有的驾驶员，自己能够调整车子，修理车子，开起来既有力道，又省汽油，又不耽误时间，我心里很羡慕。于是我就想学修车。怎样学？起初，我不得要领，只看不动手，虽然看了很多，可就是学不会。
    后来学习了毛主席著作，思想开了窍。毛主席说：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”我想，同样是一个驾驶员，为什么别人能够学得会，而我却学不会呢？原来是自己没有亲自动手去干。找到了原因，我就下定决心，拣便当的先摸起来，不懂就请教别人。在同志们的热情帮助下，我利用工前工余的时间拆拆装装，亲自动手去做。有一次，我开车出去装货，装好以后，车子发动不起，我就按照平时所掌握的技术，一步步地进行检查，原来是分电盘白金有油污，化油器的喷油管堵塞。我把这些毛病修好，一揿马达开关，车子开动起来了，我心里真有说不出的高兴。
    学会汽车小修的过程，使我明白了一个道理：眼看不如手摸。要实现从“必然王国”向“自由王国”的飞跃，必须亲自动手去干。学修汽车是这样，做其他事情也是这样。
    小账与大账
    轮胎工姜小关接着讲了一个只算小账就要吃大亏的故事。
    他说：有一天检查轮胎，发现一部汽车上的一只轮胎有一些小裂口，当时我认为这没有多大关系。旧轮胎嘛，能多跑一天就多赚一天，反正不会亏本的，就让它去跑吧！
    隔了没有几天，我接到驾驶员从外面打来的电话，说是轮胎爆破，汽车抛锚了，要求紧急修理。我赶到现场一看，爆破了的轮胎，就是前几天我看到的有些小裂口的那一只。原来轮胎上的裂口虽小，但是跑了几天，小裂口慢慢扩大，终于“嘭”地一声爆破了。车子在路上抛锚，不但运输任务不能及时完成，而且车队里派修理车送胎到现场，又得耗费不少汽油，造成了不应该有的损失。本来认为小口不修是蛮合算的，结果变成了大不合算！看到这种情况，我心里非常难过。
    这件事情使我懂得了一个道理：利和弊是对立的统一，在一定条件下是互相转化的。所谓合算与不合算要全面来看。我们做事情不但要看到眼前的利益，更要看到将来发展的利益。要算大账，不要光算小账，不要贪一时的便宜。有些事情，从局部上来看，是蛮合算的，但是从整体上看却是大不合算。如果我们只算局部的小账，不算整体的大账，那就会吃大亏。接受这次教训，以后凡是遇到轮胎上有些破损，我就及时拆下修好，这样不但大大延长了轮胎的使用寿命，而且还保证了运输任务的及时完成。
    好与坏
    小队长、驾驶员卢俊昌紧接着说：姜小关说矛盾在一定条件下是可以转化的，这话很对。我们碰到问题，遇到失败并不可怕，可就怕泄气。
    前年四月里的一天，我们小队的一部车子，在一家玻璃厂倒车时不用心，将前角灯碰坏，第二季度的全面优胜没有评上。这件事一度影响了小队同志们的积极性，有的埋怨，有的泄气。为了澄清思想，提高认识，我就组织大家学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”在学习中，大家用毛主席的哲学思想作武器，总结检查出事故的经验教训。有的说：“吃一堑，长一智。出了事故不可怕，可怕的是灰心泄气。”有的说：“吃一次亏，学一次乖。只要今后在行车中真正接受教训，就能变失败为成功。”大家认为，我们安全行车，根本目的是保护人民生命财产的安全，不是为了评上优胜。既然事故已经发生了，主要的是吸取教训，防止事故再次发生，这样才能把坏事转化为好事。如果因为出了一次事故而精神不振，又不肯吸取事故的教训，那就可能会发生更大的事故，使坏事变得更坏。因此，我们应当通过这次碰坏角灯的事故，在思想上敲起警钟，带着对人民的高度责任感开车，确保行车安全。从此以后，同志们信心十足，个个牢记这次事故的教训，每倒一次车，每掉一个头，就想到碰坏角灯的事情，时时处处，谨慎驾驶。
    在同志们的努力下，我们小队从那时候到现在，连续保持集体安全行车，从未发生类似事故，今年还评上了五好集体。
    难与易
    驾驶员张文连从两个事件的对比，体会到了运输装卸工作中保证安全的关键，也给了人们很大启发。
    有一次装罐头食品。罐头是放在箱子里的，分量不重，箱子又做得很光滑。他想，这种货物好装，何必戴上手套，自找麻烦呢！于是，就赤手装卸起来。不料，有只箱子铁皮没有包服贴，一只角冒出箱边，把他的手划破一个口子，淌了血。又一次，装一批碎玻璃。这种碎玻璃又尖又锐，一不小心就会划破手。但是他认真对待，戴好帆布手套不算，还垫上一块旧布，结果顺利地完成了任务。
    张文连说：两次装卸，使我得到一个经验教训，就是作任何事情都必须认真对待。矛盾的双方在一定的条件下是会相互转化的，装卸工作也是如此。好装之中就包含着难装的因素，而难装之中也包含着好装的因素。如果思想上认真了，难装的货物也可以装好，不出事故；相反，如果有了图简单的思想，即使是好装的货物也会发生或大或小的事故。
    外因与内因
    接着，车长、装卸工王金宏谈了“坏人如何在我身上打主意”的问题。他刚从部队复员当装卸工，曾经把一个表面上装作“老实”、“积极”、“关心人”的坏分子，当作“要好”朋友。这个坏分子看出王金宏有些不安心装卸工作，就对他说：“你应该挑个有奔头的工作做做。当装卸工没出息。”还经常对王金宏散布“人生在世、吃喝玩乐”的思想，后来，王金宏学习了毛主席的阶级斗争的理论，对这个坏分子提高了警惕，和群众一起，揭发批判了他的反动言行。
    王金宏从这件事受到很大教育。他说：毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导和唯物辩证法，教人心红眼睛亮。我学了毛主席的哲学思想，懂得了外因与内因的关系，懂得了坏人如何在我身上打主意。毛主席说：“唯物辩证法认为外因是变化的条件，内因是变化的根据，外因通过内因而起作用。”俗话说：“苍蝇不叮无缝的鸡蛋”，原来因为在我思想上有个人主义霉点，敌人看准了这一点，就乘虚而入，得寸进尺，而我却失去警惕，看不清他的反动本质，竟一度把他当作“要好”朋友，这是多么危险啊！毛主席教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。在社会主义社会里，反动统治阶级虽然已被我们打倒，但是他们还不死心，他们会采取更隐蔽、更狡猾的手法，向我们进攻。这个人混入装卸工队伍，对我的“帮助”、“体贴”等都是他进行阶级斗争的一种手段。我们要能够在这种尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，及时识破阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，首先就要认真活学活用毛主席著作，清除自己思想上的“霉点”，树立全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观。
