    Morning Reading
    Soldier Qin Tianxiang
    The sea has not yet awakened, and the sound of reading comes from the deck.
    Who is up so early?
    Even the mountains bow their heads to listen.
    Reading a sentence is like a drop of sweet dew, nourishing the young soul;
    Turning a page is like a gust of spring breeze, filling the broad mind of the soldier.
    Reading and reading, like walking into the ocean of truth,
    Tells you, what is called a fighting life;
    Reading and reading, like climbing to the peak of the era,
    Seeing the turbulent situation in the world.
    At this moment, the soldier holding Chairman Mao's works,
    Is like the sea holding up a round of the rising sun!
    When the sunshine covers the mighty fleet,
    The young sailors seem to have grown taller again.

    晨读
    战士　秦天祥大海还没有苏醒，甲板上传来阵阵读书声。是谁起得这么早哇？高山也俯首倾听。读一句，象一滴甘露，滋润着年青的心灵；翻一页，象一阵春风，吹满了战士广阔的胸襟。读呀读，象走进真理的海洋，告诉你，什么叫做战斗的人生；读呀读，象攀上时代的顶峰，看到了，五洲四海风云滚滚。此刻呵，战士捧着毛主席著作，象大海托起朝日一轮！当阳光镀满了威武的舰群，年轻的水兵又仿佛长高了几分。
