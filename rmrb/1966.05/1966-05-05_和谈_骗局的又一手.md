    Another Trick in the "Peace Talks" Swindle
                       By Our Staff Commentator
    Recently, U.S. imperialism has been employing a two-pronged approach on the Vietnam issue: on the one hand, intensifying the escalation of its war of aggression; on the other hand, vigorously promoting the "peace talks" swindle. The Johnson administration is attempting to use the blackmail of expanding the war to force a "peace talks" situation, and is also attempting to use the smokescreen of "peace talks" to cover up its activities of expanding the war. U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary dual tactics are being played out very blatantly.
    Mansfield's "new appeal" for "peace talks," recently thrown out by Washington, is yet another trick employed by U.S. imperialism using its counter-revolutionary dual tactics. So, what's new about Mansfield's so-called "new appeal"?
    The so-called "new appeal" put forward by Mansfield, the Democratic Party leader in the U.S. Senate, on April 18th, contains nothing more than two central points. First, the United States would hold "face-to-face talks" with "Hanoi, Beijing" "at a peace table"; second, the "best" place to "set up this peace table" is in some Asian country.
    Anyone with clear eyes can see that this is completely Johnson government's worn-out tune, with nothing new about it, something people have long been tired of hearing.
    What does "face-to-face talks" mean? This is clearly a revamped version of the "unconditional discussions" junk that the Johnson government has been peddling for over a year. This means asking the Vietnamese people to abandon their sacred right to resist aggression, defend their independence and sovereignty, and strive for the unification of their motherland, and to sit at a table with the American aggressors, whose hands are stained with blood, while the U.S. occupies South Vietnam and frantically expands the war. This means asking the Chinese people to abandon their just stance of supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation through to the end, regardless of right or wrong, and to help the United States realize its "peace talks" swindle. To seriously present such absurd things and ask the Vietnamese and Chinese people to accept them is nothing but wishful thinking and daydreaming.
    The so-called "setting up" a "peace table" in some Asian place is even more utter nonsense. The Johnson government's "peace table" is a trap it intends to use to gain what it cannot obtain on the battlefield. No matter where this table is set, whether it is in Europe or Asia, whether it is inside the United Nations or outside the United Nations, whether it is in the sky or on the ground, it is still a trap. More and more people around the world have already seen through this.
    Therefore, to put it bluntly, Mansfield's so-called "new appeal" is a bluff, attempting to deceive the world. In reality, the focus of U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy activities is not here.
    In order to extricate itself from the predicament it is deeply mired in in Vietnam, the Johnson government, while stepping up the expansion of the war, is using various channels and various figures to quietly carry out the transaction of peddling the "peace talks" swindle.
    People see that in this regard, there are many people working for U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy.
    The British Labour government has always been eager to jump in, frequently offering advice for "peace talks." The Japanese Sato government is working very hard, even sending special envoys to travel all over Asia, Europe, and Africa. The Indian reactionaries are cooperating either overtly or covertly, especially using their identity as the chairman of the International Control Commission for Vietnam to collude with other members of the commission, trying to open new channels. U.N. Secretary-General U Thant is even more publicly active, running between North America and Western Europe. They are all quite active figures in U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy activities.
    It must be solemnly pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionists, who are waving the banner of "aid Vietnam and oppose America," are the number one salesman of the U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" swindle. Over the past year, Soviet leaders' behind-the-scenes activities in instigating "peace talks" have never ceased. Some international conferences and international activities they have convened and participated in are creating an uproar of voices advocating "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue. Recently, after the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, Gromyko immediately held unusual secret talks with the Pope on the Vietnam issue. As soon as this Soviet Foreign Minister stepped out of the Vatican gate, the U.S. "Ambassador" Lodge stepped into the same gate. The mystery here is self-evident. Although the Soviet modern revisionists have said some nice words and offered a little "aid" on the Vietnam issue, and their methods of serving the United States are more covert, what they are actually doing is coordinating with U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary dual tactics, peddling the Johnson government's "peace talks" plan, attempting to extinguish the flames of revolution of the Vietnamese people, and betraying the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people. No wonder the American bourgeois newspapers have openly said that Soviet leaders "may become brokers helping us achieve a decent peace in Vietnam."
    It is no accident that U.S. imperialism is so painstakingly promoting its "peace talks" conspiracy, and that its accomplices and lackeys are engaging in activities so tirelessly. The American aggressors in Vietnam have already fallen into an unprecedented predicament. The United States has invested two to three hundred thousand troops in the South Vietnam battlefield, but as a result they are still passively taking a beating and suffering heavy casualties. Its expanded bombing of North Vietnam has resulted in the shooting down of more than a thousand aircraft. Its attempts to stabilize the puppet regime have resulted in the small Nguyen Cao Ky court being precarious, and in a state of uncertainty. The Johnson government is besieged on all sides, both domestically and internationally, and what awaits it is not the laurel of victory, but the death knell of its doomsday. Therefore, the Johnson government is trying to extricate itself from its predicament and save its defeat. Under such a situation, whether it is the emergence of Mansfield's "new appeal" or the activities of all kinds of monsters and demons, the purpose is to maintain U.S. imperialism's policy of occupying South Vietnam, and to help the United States untie the noose that is tightening around its neck.
    However, U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam, no matter to what level it is escalated, will inevitably end in complete failure. The "peace talks" conspiracy promoted by U.S. imperialism, no matter who helps it, will eventually be seen through by more and more people. Those who oppose the people are bound to be overthrown by the people. Those who go against the tide of history are bound to be submerged by the tide of history. U.S. imperialism and its accomplices' various struggles on the Vietnam issue will ultimately only arouse and promote the further unity and struggle of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of all countries, thereby accelerating the early arrival of their doomsday.

    “和谈”骗局的又一手
                       本报评论员
    最近一个时期，美帝国主义在越南问题上，双管齐下：一面加紧侵略战争的升级，一面竭力推行“和谈”的骗局。约翰逊政府妄图用扩大战争的讹诈，压出一个“和谈”的局面，又妄图用“和谈”的烟幕，掩盖它扩大战争的活动。美帝国主义反革命的两手策略，玩弄得十分露骨。
    华盛顿不久前抛出的曼斯菲尔德的“和谈”“新呼吁”，就是美帝国主义施展反革命两手策略的又一手。那么，所谓曼斯菲尔德的“新呼吁”，到底有什么新鲜之处呢？
    美国参议院民主党头子曼斯菲尔德四月十八日提出的所谓“新呼吁”，其中心内容不外乎两点。一，美国同“河内、北京”“在一张和平桌上”“面对面会谈”；二，“设置这种和平桌的地方”，“最好不过的”是亚洲某个国家。
    明眼人一看便知，这完全是约翰逊政府的陈腔滥调，毫无新鲜之点，人们早就听厌了。
    什么叫“面对面会谈”？这分明是约翰逊政府抛出了一年多的“无条件讨论”陈货的翻版。这就是要越南人民抛弃反抗侵略、保卫独立主权和争取祖国统一的神圣权利，在美国占领南越和疯狂扩大战争的情况下，同双手沾满鲜血的美国侵略者，坐到一张桌子旁。这就是要中国人民不问是非曲直，抛弃自己支援越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底的正义立场，去帮助美国实现“和谈”的骗局。这样荒唐透顶的东西，竟然象煞有介事地拿出来，要越南人民和中国人民接受，真是想入非非，白日做梦。
    所谓要在亚洲什么地方“设置”一张“和平桌”，更是十足的废话。约翰逊政府的“和平桌”，是它妄图取得它在战场上得不到的东西的一个圈套。这张桌子不论设在哪里，是欧洲也好，亚洲也好；联合国里也好，联合国外也好；天上也好，地上也好；都是圈套一个。这一点，全世界有越来越多的人，已经识破。
    因此，拆穿了说，曼斯菲尔德的所谓“新呼吁”，是虚张声势，企图借以迷惑世人耳目。实际上，美帝国主义“和谈”阴谋活动的重点，并不在此。
    约翰逊政府为了摆脱它在越南深深陷入的困境，在加紧扩大战争的同时，利用种种渠道，通过各色人等，悄悄地进行兜售“和谈”骗局的交易。
    人们看到，在这方面，为美帝国主义“和谈”阴谋出力的，大有人在。
    英国工党政府向来不甘人后，频频为“和谈”献策。日本佐藤政府十分卖力，不惜派出特使，跑遍亚欧非三大洲。印度反动派或明或暗地配合，特别利用自己作为越南国际委员会主席的身份，同委员会的其他成员勾搭，力图打开新的渠道。联合国秘书长吴丹，更是抛头露面，奔走于北美西欧之间。他们都是美帝国主义“和谈”阴谋活动中相当活跃的人物。
    必须严正指出的是，打着“援越反美”旗号的苏联现代修正主义者，更是美帝国主义“和谈”骗局的一个头号推销员。一年来，苏联领导人策动“和谈”的幕后活动，从未间断。他们召集和参加的一些国际会议和国际活动，鼓吹越南问题“和谈”的声浪，甚嚣尘上。最近，苏共二十三大之后，葛罗米柯马上同罗马教皇就越南问题进行了不寻常的密谈。这位苏联外长前脚刚踏出梵蒂冈大门，美国“大使”洛奇后脚就跨进同一个大门。这里面的蹊跷，不言自明。苏联现代修正主义者在越南问题上，虽然讲了一些漂亮话，拿出了一点“援助”，为美国效劳的手法也更隐蔽一些，但是，他们脚踏实地干的却是配合美帝国主义反革命的两手策略，兜售约翰逊政府的“和谈”方案，企图扑灭越南人民的革命烈火，出卖越南人民的根本利益。无怪乎美国资产阶级报刊毫不隐讳地说，苏联领导人“可能成为帮助我们在越南实现体面的和平的掮客”。
    美帝国主义如此挖空心思地推行“和谈”阴谋，它的帮凶、走卒们如此不辞辛劳地活动，不是偶然的。美国侵略者在越南已经陷入前所未有的困境。美国在南越战场投入了二、三十万兵力，结果照样被动挨打，伤亡惨重。它对越南北方扩大轰炸，结果是一千多架飞机被揍了下来。它力图稳住傀儡统治，结果是阮高其小朝廷风雨飘摇，朝不保夕。约翰逊政府内外交困，四面楚歌，等待着它的，不是胜利的桂冠，而是末日的丧钟。因此，约翰逊政府力图摆脱困境，挽回败局。在这种局面下，无论是曼斯菲尔德“新呼吁”的出笼，还是一切牛鬼蛇神的活动，目的都是为了维持美帝国主义霸占南越的政策，并且帮助美国解脱套在它脖子上的那一根越拉越紧的绞索。
    但是，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，不管它升到哪一级，必定以彻底的失败告终。美帝国主义推行的“和谈”阴谋，不管有什么人帮忙，终将为越来越多的人所识破。反对人民的必定被人民所打倒。违背历史潮流的必定被历史潮流所淹没。美帝国主义及其帮凶在越南问题上的种种挣扎，到头来，只能激起和促进越南人民和各国革命人民的进一步团结和斗争，从而加速它们末日的早日到来。
