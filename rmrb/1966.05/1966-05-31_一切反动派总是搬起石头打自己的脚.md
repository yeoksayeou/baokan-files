    All Reactionaries Always Lift a Stone to Drop It on Their Own Feet
    As revolutionary fighters, we must be a hundred times more vigilant, remember Chairman Mao's teachings firmly, keep our eyes wide open, stand firm, grip our guns tightly, and be ready to smash all the enemy's conspiracies at any time.
    Shenyang Military Region, a certain unit, Wang Daoming, Cao Huichen
    Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese saying to describe the behavior of some fools. Reactionaries in all countries are such fools." This irrefutable truth has been repeatedly proven by all reactionaries in history. But reactionaries do not take this as a lesson, they still lift a stone to drop it on their own feet in the same way. Now Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist clowns have come on stage again. Then let us review Chairman Mao's teaching, using Deng Tuo and his gang of clowns as material, to study why reactionaries always lift a stone to drop it on their own feet, and why they continue to lift a stone to drop it on their own feet.
    Deng Tuo and his gang, who claim to understand "history," should have some knowledge of China's modern revolutionary history! Let's not talk about the distant past, just the recent past: In 1946, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, relying on American imperialism as its backing, clamored to eliminate the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army within a few months, and was arrogant for a time. What was the result? All eight million of the Kuomintang reactionary troops were wiped out. In 1957, a small handful of right-wing elements also took the stage to perform. They attacked the Party and the socialist system with arrogance, saying that the Communist Party was "the party's world," "the present is not as good as the past," "cooperation has messed things up," etc., vainly trying to drive the Communist Party off the stage. The result was that they failed to steal rice and lost their bags, and they themselves became the target of attacks and beatings by the broad masses, and thus completely failed. American imperialism has been slandering and attacking us as "belligerent" all the time, and it has been stirring up anti-China sentiment everywhere, establishing military bases to surround our country. As a result, it has formed a situation of "universal betrayal and encirclement on all sides" and is in the embarrassing situation of "a rat crossing the street, everyone shouting to beat it." And our friends are all over the world. The Khrushchev revisionist clique, adapting to the needs of imperialism, betrayed the international communist movement, opposed communism, opposed China, and opposed the world revolution. The result? Khrushchev fell, the new Soviet leadership came to power, and anti-China sentiment became even more vigorous, and things got even worse. There are truly countless such examples.
    In fact, Deng Tuo, a junior of the reactionaries in history, has nothing new to offer in this performance. He just changed his mask, re-dressed himself, and sang the "stereotyped tune" left by his predecessors. However, Deng Tuo has after all learned some "lessons." He did not pick up a gun and fight us, nor did he scold us directly, but instead "cleverly" played some tricks. In the name of "talking about history," "telling stories," and "passing on knowledge," he used methods such as using the past to satirize the present, insinuating, hinting, and scolding one thing while meaning another to attack our Party and the socialist system. The stone was still lifted, only the method was different. The result was that he tried to cover things up but only made them more obvious, and made things worse, smashing the clown's feet even more painfully and failing even more miserably.
    Isn't the fact the most eloquent proof? Deng Tuo and his gang viciously attacked our Party and attacked our socialist system. The more tricks they played, the more they revealed their true colors. Wu Han was first dragged out and condemned by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. When Deng Tuo saw that things were not going well, he hurriedly came on stage, on the one hand to extricate his "brother" Wu Han, and on the other hand to cover himself, using a "self-inflicted injury" trick. The result was that we saw through it. Just when he was in crisis, *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* came forward and published an article that was a fake criticism and a real cover-up. Unexpectedly, this time they covered their heads but exposed their buttocks, allowing the broad masses of people to grab their tails and drag out the "Three-Family Village" black shop, along with the anti-Party and anti-socialist tools of the black shop—*Qianxian*, *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News*. The workers, peasants, and soldiers rose up and attacked them. Not only did they smash their feet, but they also smashed their heads and bled.
    People cannot help but ask: Why do reactionaries fail more miserably than one another? Why don't they take this as a warning and instead repeat the same mistakes? Let us look at Chairman Mao's teachings, and it will be clear at a glance. Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will still make a final struggle." "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until their demise—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the cause of the people." Reactionaries will never violate this logic, which is determined by their reactionary class nature. The socialist revolution is the most profound and thorough revolution. It does not replace one form of exploitation with another, but to completely eliminate exploitation, eliminate classes, and establish a socialist and communist society. Therefore, the class struggle in the ideological field that reflects this social change must also be the most thorough and profound in history. The more the revolution develops, the closer the reactionary forces get to their demise, the more they will struggle to the death; the deeper the revolution goes, the more clowns will appear to block the wheels of history, until they are completely comfortable only after being crushed by the wheels of history. But in front of the wheels of history, new "clowns" will appear, and the new "clowns" will be crushed again. This is how history advances.
    The appearance of Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist "clowns" is because the socialist economic base is becoming increasingly consolidated, the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts is constantly victorious, and the class struggle in the ideological field has become more acute and complex. The old ideas, old concepts, and old consciousness in the ideological field, that is, the feudal remnants and bourgeois ideas, must be constantly criticized and completely eliminated in order to meet the requirements of the socialist economic base and prepare conditions for the transition to communism. This is the inevitable trend of revolutionary development. Especially now that the masses have mastered Mao Zedong Thought and have entered the era of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory, this is a major change and leap of historical significance. Therefore, a small number of intellectuals standing on the positions of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie will inevitably stubbornly resist and resist this great change, attempting to transform the world with the bourgeois world outlook. Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements came on stage in this way.
    All reactionaries are the biggest subjectivists. This is determined by their reactionary class nature, they always misjudge the situation, and Deng Tuo and his gang are no exception.
    In 1961, our country encountered temporary economic difficulties due to natural disasters; internationally, American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries launched an unprecedented chorus of anti-China. Domestically, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists were eager to move. The shopkeepers and associates of the "Three-Family Village" thought that dark clouds had appeared in the sky and that storms were coming. So they "broke out of the door," were overjoyed, and rubbed their hands and said: "The wax drum sounds, the spring grass grows," "The spring season is about to start working hard." They "divided the work and cooperated," echoed each other, and cooperated in all directions, setting off black waves and blowing up evil winds, launching a large-scale attack on the Party and socialism. By the spring of 1962, they were so arrogant that they regarded the international and domestic counter-revolutionary currents as waves, happily shouting: "This wave is really big," and estimated that it would be "getting bigger and bigger." Look! How beautiful the "Three-Family Village" black gang's dream is! However, the development of things is always contrary to the wishes of the reactionaries. The result is that the east wind blows away the dark clouds, the sun shines on the earth, and a small group of demons and monsters are exposed in broad daylight, with no room to hide. Isn't this smashing one's own feet again?
    The reason why reactionaries always lift "stones" is also because their reactionary class nature determines that they always do not believe that the people are the masters of history, and they always overestimate their own strength. Isn't Deng Tuo and his gang like this? Their *Yanshan Evening Talks* and *Three-Family Village Notes* wrote so much about the "three religions," "nine streams," and the "history" of emperors, generals, and ministers. "Defending Li Sancai," "Zheng Banqiao's character of not being a slave," and "Hai Rui's spirit of scolding the emperor" were all nothing more than using the past to satirize the present, cursing our Party and the socialist system, vainly trying to make us learn from and admire these landlords and their political representatives, and inciting us to be dissatisfied with reality. They simply do not understand that it is always the masses of the people who control the destiny of history, and the development of history will never be shifted by the wishes of a small group of reactionaries. The masses of the people are the real bronze walls and iron walls. They stubbornly oppose the masses of the people, and they cannot but lift a stone to smash their own feet.
    From this point of view, it is inevitable for reactionaries to lift stones. And no matter how the method of lifting changes, the consequence of smashing feet is also doomed. Now the fierce counterattack launched by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers against the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" black shop to uproot the "Three-Family Village" and "Four-Family Village" is the result of Deng Tuo and his gang lifting "stones."
    From a revolutionary point of view, it is a good thing for reactionaries to lift stones to drop them on their own feet. It educates the revolutionary people from the negative side. Deng Tuo, this negative teacher, has inspired us to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently. The crimes of the "Three-Family Village" once again warn us that in a society where classes exist, the class struggle will never end, and the nature of imperialism and all reactionaries will never change. We must never forget the class struggle. At the same time, it also tells us that the class struggle in the socialist revolution period is complex and long-term. The enemy's attacks on us are overt, covert, civil, and military. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, master this omnipotent weapon, in order to see through all the conspiracies of class enemies.
    However, we must also see that the purpose of the reactionaries in lifting stones is not to drop them on their own feet, but to smash our heads. It is because we have recognized them in the practice of revolution and have heightened our vigilance, so that the enemy's wishes have been transformed in the opposite direction. If we relax our vigilance, the stone will still smash the revolutionary people. Therefore, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionary things, if you do not hit them, they will not fall." All reactionaries will never lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot. Therefore, as revolutionary fighters, we must be a hundred times more vigilant, remember Chairman Mao's teachings firmly, keep our eyes wide open, stand firm, grip our guns tightly, and be ready to smash all the enemy's conspiracies at any time.
    Let the reactionaries forever lift a stone to drop it on their own feet!

    一切反动派总是搬起石头打自己的脚
    作为革命战士，必须百倍警惕，把毛主席的教导记得牢牢的，眼睛擦得亮亮的，脚跟站得稳稳的，枪杆子握得紧紧的，随时准备粉碎一切敌人的阴谋
    沈阳部队某部　王道明　曹惠臣
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”这个颠扑不破的真理早已被历史上的一切反动派反复证明了。但是反动派并不以此为教训，他们还是照样地搬起石头打自己的脚。现在邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义的小丑又出场表演了。那就让我们重温一下毛主席的这一教导，以邓拓这一伙小丑为材料，研究一下反动派为什么总是搬起石头打自己的脚，而且还要不断地搬起石头打自己的脚。
    自称懂得“历史”的邓拓一伙，对于中国的近代革命史知识总该有一点吧！远的不讲，只讲近的：一九四六年，蒋介石反动派依仗美帝国主义作后盾，叫嚷在几个月内消灭共产党、八路军，一时嚣张得很。结果怎样呢？八百万国民党反动军队全部报销了。一九五七年，一小撮右派分子也登台表演了一番。他们狂妄地向党向社会主义制度发起了进攻，说什么共产党是“党天下”，“今不如昔”，“合作化搞糟了”，等等，妄想把共产党赶下台。结果是没有偷到米，反把口袋舍了，他们自己成为广大群众围攻打倒的对象，因而彻底失败。美帝国主义时时刻刻都在诬蔑攻击我们“好战”，它到处煽动反华，建立军事基地包围我国。结果使它自己形成了“众叛亲离、四面楚歌”的局面，处在“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的窘境。而我们的朋友遍天下。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，适应帝国主义的需要，背叛国际共产主义运动，反共、反华、反对世界革命。结果呢？赫鲁晓夫垮台了，苏联新领导上台，反华更起劲，日子就更糟。这样的例子真是举不胜举。
    其实，邓拓这个历史上反动派的晚辈，这次出场表演，也没有啥新鲜玩艺，只不过是换了换面具，重新打扮打扮，唱的还是他的前辈留下的“陈词滥调”。但是，邓拓毕竟是吸取了些“教训”，他没有拿起枪来和我们干，也没有直出直入地骂，而是“自作聪明”地耍了一些花招。用“谈历史”、“讲故事”、“传知识”为名，采用借古讽今、含沙射影、旁敲侧击、指桑骂槐等等手法，攻击我们的党和社会主义制度。石头照样搬，方法不同而已。结果是欲盖弥彰，弄巧成拙，把小丑的脚砸得更痛，失败得更惨。
    事实不是最胜于雄辩吗？邓拓一伙恶毒地攻击我们的党，攻击我们的社会主义制度，花招耍得越多，越露出了马脚。吴晗首先被揪出来，遭到了广大工农兵群众的斥责。邓拓一看大事不好，急忙出场，一方面为吴晗“老弟”解围，另一方面也为掩护自己，使了一个“苦肉计”，结果还是被我们识破。正在危急的时候，《前线》、《北京日报》出面发表了一篇假批判、真掩护的文章，没想到这下子盖上脑袋，露出了屁股，让广大人民揪住了尾巴，把“三家村”黑店，连同黑店的反党反社会主义工具——《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》一古脑揪了出来。工农兵群众奋起而攻之。不但砸了脚，而且砸得头破血流。
    人们不禁要问：反动派为什么一个比一个失败得更惨？他们都不引以为戒，反而重蹈复辙呢？让我们看看毛主席的教导，就一清二楚了。毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑。”反动派决不会违背这个逻辑，这是由于它的反动的阶级本性决定的。社会主义革命是一次最深刻、最彻底的革命，它不是用一种剥削形式代替另一种剥削形式，而是要彻底消灭剥削，消灭阶级，要建立社会主义、共产主义社会。因而，反映这种社会变革的意识形态领域中的阶级斗争，也必然是历史上最彻底、最深刻的。革命越发展，反动势力越接近灭亡，它们越要垂死挣扎；革命深入一步，就会出现一次跳梁小丑来阻挡历史车轮，直到被历史车轮轧得粉碎才彻底舒服。但是在历史车轮的前边，还会出现新的“小丑”，新的“小丑”再被辗碎，历史就是这样在前进。
    邓拓一伙反党反社会主义“小丑”的出现，就是因为社会主义经济基础日益巩固，政治战线、思想战线社会主义革命的不断胜利，意识形态领域的阶级斗争更加尖锐复杂起来。意识形态领域的旧思想、旧观念、旧意识即封建残余、资产阶级思想，必须不断批判，直至彻底扫除，才能适应社会主义经济基础的要求，并为向共产主义过渡准备条件。这是革命发展的必然趋势。特别是当前群众已掌握了毛泽东思想，进入了工农兵掌握理论的时代，这是一个具有历史意义的重大变革和飞跃。因此，一小部分站在封建地主阶级立场和资产阶级立场上的知识分子，必然顽强地抵制和抗拒这一伟大的变革，企图用资产阶级世界观改造世界。邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子就是这样出场的。
    一切反动派，都是最大的主观主义者。这是由于他们的反动的阶级本质所决定，他们总是错误的估计形势，邓拓一伙也不例外。
    一九六一年，我们国内因为受到自然灾害，遇到暂时的经济困难；国际上，美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，掀起了空前的反华大合唱。国内，地富反坏右蠢蠢欲动。“三家村”的掌柜和伙计们以为天空出现乌云了，风雨来临了，于是“破门而出”，得意忘形，摩拳擦掌地说：“腊鼓鸣，春草生”，“春季就要开始大干”。他们“分工合作”，相互呼应、四面配合，掀起了黑浪，刮起了妖风，向党向社会主义发起大规模的进攻。到了一九六二年春天，他们竟狂妄到这种地步：把国际国内的反革命逆流当做浪，高兴地喊叫：“这股浪头可真大”，而且估计是“越来越大”。看！“三家村”黑帮的梦做得多美！但是事物的发展总是和反动派的愿望相反，结果是东风吹散了乌云，阳光普照了大地，一小撮牛鬼蛇神暴露在光天化日之下，毫无躲藏的余地。这不又是砸了自己的脚吗？
    反动派之所以总是搬“石头”，还因他们反动的阶级本性决定着他们总是不相信人民群众是历史的主人，总是过高地估计自己的力量。邓拓一伙不正是这样吗？他们的《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》，写了那么多“三教”、“九流”、帝王将相的“历史”。“为李三才辩护”也好，“郑板桥不当奴才的性格”也好，“海瑞骂皇帝的精神”也好，无非是借古讽今，咒骂我们党和社会主义制度，妄图要我们学习、崇敬这些地主和他们的政治代表人物，煽动我们对现实不满。它们根本不懂得掌握历史命运的永远是人民群众，历史的发展决不会以一小撮反动派的愿望为转移。人民群众是真正的铜墙铁壁，他们顽固地反对人民群众，就不能不是搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
    由此看来，反动派搬石头是必然的。而且不管搬法如何千变万化，砸脚的后果也是注定的。现在广大工农兵群众向反党反社会主义的“三家村”黑店进行的猛烈反击，要把“三家村”、“四家村”连根挖掉，正是邓拓一伙搬“石头”的结果。
    从革命的观点来看，反动派搬石头砸自己的脚，这是一件好事。它从反面教育了革命的人民。邓拓这个反面教员就激励了我们更努力学习毛主席著作。“三家村”的罪行再一次告诫我们：在存在阶级的社会内，阶级斗争永远不会完结，帝国主义和一切反动派的本性永远不会改变。我们千万不能忘记阶级斗争。同时，也告诉我们：社会主义革命时期的阶级斗争是复杂的、长期的。敌人向我们的进攻，有明的，有暗的，有文的，有武的。我们必须认真地学好毛主席著作，掌握这个万能的武器，才能识破一切阶级敌人的阴谋。
    但是，我们也必须看到：反动派搬石头的目的不是为了砸它自己的脚，而是为了砸我们的头。是因为我们在革命的实践中认识了它们，提高了警惕，所以才使敌人的愿望向反面转化。如果我们放松了警惕，石头仍然会砸向革命的人民。因此，我们必须牢记毛主席的教导：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，它就不倒。”一切反动派决不会放下屠刀立地成佛。因此，我们作为革命战士，必须百倍警惕，把毛主席的教导记得牢牢的，眼睛擦得亮亮的，脚跟站得稳稳的，枪杆子握得紧紧的，随时准备粉碎一切敌人的阴谋。
    让反动派永远搬起石头砸自己的脚去吧！
