    Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The fascist persecution of Overseas Chinese by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces continues to provoke strong reactions among returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese in various localities. Returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese in various parts of Guangdong, as well as in Chengdu, Chongqing, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Nanjing, and other places, have held gatherings in recent days. At these meetings, they emphasized that the great Chinese people cannot be humiliated, and that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, catering to the needs of US imperialism by rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, will ultimately reap the bitter fruit. They strongly demanded that the Indonesian government must promptly provide a satisfactory response to the note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 18th, allowing the victimized Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to the motherland to do so smoothly as soon as possible.
    At a gathering of representatives from all sectors of returned Overseas Chinese on Hainan Island, Guangdong, Zhou Zheng, chairman of the Hainan Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, pointed out that the anti-China atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are organized, planned, and carried out in stages, and they cannot deny their responsibility for the fascist persecution of Overseas Chinese. On behalf of hundreds of thousands of returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese in the region, he demanded that the Indonesian government promptly provide a satisfactory response to the note from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Many returned Overseas Chinese at the meeting angrily denounced the heinous crimes of Indonesian right-wing thugs. Worker Fu Jifu said that his brother-in-law, Zhan Yishui, residing in Setadawa, Indonesia, was subjected to the vicious hands of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces for actively developing friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people out of love for the motherland. Last December, he was stabbed more than twenty times by right-wing thugs and died, leaving behind orphans and widows in Indonesia with no means of support. He angrily said that the Indonesian right-wing thugs' countless blood debts to Overseas Chinese will surely be settled one day. Returned Overseas Chinese from Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Shaoguan held gatherings. Chen Huacai, a returned Overseas Chinese from Nanbang, Indonesia, in Zhanjiang City, revealed that in his area, more than 4,000 students and 150 teachers were out of school and unemployed due to the forced closure of Overseas Chinese schools by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
    Returned Overseas Chinese in Chengdu, at a gathering held on the 21st, strongly condemned the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces for openly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, using Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents as accomplices, and more rampantly persecuting Overseas Chinese. Li Kaixun, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a teacher at Chongqing Coal Mine School, revealed at a gathering of returned Overseas Chinese in Chongqing that when Indonesian right-wing military police broke into his home last November, they saw an embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao that his father had brought back from a sightseeing trip to China in 1959. They slandered his father for "illegal activities," carried out extensive looting and destruction of his home, and insulted the embroidered portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in every possible way. This proves that the anti-China and anti-Chinese activities organized by the Indonesian right-wing authorities have their political purpose. Huang Pitian, a mechanical engineer at the Machine Casting Workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant, said that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, relying on US imperialism and willing to be its pawns, are frantically opposing China and discriminating against Chinese, which not only cannot harm a single hair of our great motherland but will also further expose their ugly faces.
    Returned Overseas Chinese in Jinan and Qingdao also held gatherings. Zhang Mingying, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a middle school teacher, denounced at a gathering in Jinan that on February 2nd this year, her cousin Zhang Bixiang, who ran a factory in Jakarta, was shot and killed on the spot by right-wing thugs in broad daylight in Jakarta for failing to rob him of his property. At a gathering of returned Overseas Chinese in Qingdao on the 21st, Yang Zanzhou, a member of the Shandong Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, said that since the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces launched a military coup, they have carried out a shocking bloody massacre in the country, followed by anti-China farces one after another. We want to warn the Indonesian reactionaries: no matter how rampant you are, you will only end up with a disgraceful end like other anti-China clowns. The returned Overseas Chinese also exposed the political conspiracy of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces to oppose China, discriminate against Chinese, and persecute Overseas Chinese with a large number of facts. Xu Minxian, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and a teacher at Beijing Road Primary School, said that the Indonesian government described the persecution of Overseas Chinese as a "reaction of the angry masses." This is nonsense and an attempt to shirk responsibility. As everyone knows, the current Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik has repeatedly and openly incited anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and those who have carried out these anti-China activities are actually only a small handful of reactionaries. We tell the Indonesian reactionaries that you are the ones who are persecuting Overseas Chinese, and this ironclad fact can never be denied.
    Returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese in Taiyuan, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and other places also held gatherings. Liu Qi, chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, Song Jinrong, deputy secretary-general, Huang Hua, chairman of the Taiyuan Municipal Overseas Chinese Federation, Xu Riqing, a returned Overseas Chinese, and others, pointed out at a gathering of returned Overseas Chinese in Taiyuan that the Indonesian government's claim that Overseas Chinese returning to China is "due to the orders or political measures of the Chinese government" is absurd. Overseas Chinese demand to escape the tiger's mouth and return to the motherland as soon as possible, which is entirely the result of the persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries. Our government and the Overseas Chinese who have already returned will never stand idly by and watch their compatriots suffer in dire straits. The four demands of the Chinese government are completely reasonable, completely legitimate, and completely in line with international law, and the Indonesian government must respond promptly. At a gathering of returned Overseas Chinese in Nanjing, many family members of victimized Overseas Chinese angrily denounced the heinous crimes of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in beating, looting, kidnapping, and killing their relatives. At a joint gathering held by the Henan Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation and the Zhengzhou Municipal Overseas Chinese Federation, Hu Xuanchang, vice chairman of the Henan Provincial Overseas Chinese Federation, Chen Daming, chairman of the Zhengzhou Municipal Overseas Chinese Federation, and many returned Overseas Chinese denounced the heinous crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in persecuting Overseas Chinese in their speeches.

    各地归国华侨和侨眷集会继续声讨印尼右派迫害华侨的罪行
    印尼右派迎合美帝需要反华排华必自食恶果
    据新华社二十三日讯　印度尼西亚右派反动势力对华侨进行法西斯迫害的暴行，在各地归国华侨和华侨眷属中继续激起强烈反应。广东各地和成都、重庆、济南、青岛、太原、郑州、南京等地的归侨、侨眷这几天分别举行了集会。他们在会上强调指出，伟大的中国人民是不可侮的，印度尼西亚右派反动势力迎合美帝国主义的需要猖狂反华排华，终将自食恶果。他们强烈要求印度尼西亚政府必须迅速对我国外交部五月十八日的照会作出圆满的答复，让自愿回国的受害华侨早日顺利回到祖国。
    在广东侨乡海南岛各界归国华侨代表举行的集会上，海南归国华侨联合会主席周铮指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力的反华暴行是有组织、有计划、有步骤地进行的，他们抵赖不了对华侨进行法西斯迫害的罪责。他代表全区几十万归侨、侨眷，要求印度尼西亚政府对我国外交部的照会迅速作出满意的答复。许多归侨在会上愤怒控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒的滔天罪行。工人傅吉福说，他的侨居印度尼西亚实打挖的姐夫詹乙水为热爱祖国积极发展中国和印度尼西亚人民的友谊，竟遭到印度尼西亚右派反动势力的毒手，去年十二月他被右派暴徒连刺二十多刀后死去，现在遗下孤儿寡妇在印度尼西亚，生活无着。他愤怒地说，印度尼西亚右派暴徒对华侨的累累血债，必有被清算的一天。汕头、湛江、韶关各界归侨举行了集会。湛江市印度尼西亚归侨陈华才揭露说，他所在的印度尼西亚楠榜地区，就有四千多学生、一百五十名教师因华侨学校被印度尼西亚右派反动势力强迫关闭而失学、失业。
    成都市归国华侨在二十一日举行的集会上，强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力公开同蒋匪帮勾结，利用蒋匪帮特务作为爪牙，更加猖狂地迫害华侨的罪恶勾当。印度尼西亚归侨、重庆煤矿学校教师李开勋在重庆市归侨举行的集会上揭露说，去年十一月印度尼西亚右派军警冲进他的家搜查时，看见他父亲一九五九年回国观光时带回去的一幅毛主席绣象，便污蔑他父亲有“非法行为”，对他家进行了大肆抢劫破坏，并对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的绣象百般侮辱，这证明印度尼西亚右派当局组织的反华排华活动是有其政治目的的。重钢机铸车间机械工程师黄丕田说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力投靠美帝国主义，甘当美帝国主义的走卒，疯狂地反华排华，不仅损害不了我们伟大祖国的一根毫毛，反而更加暴露了他们的丑恶面目。
    济南和青岛市的归侨也举行了集会。印度尼西亚归侨、中学教员张明瑛在济南举行的集会上控诉说，今年二月二日他在雅加达经营工厂的堂哥张必祥，竟在雅加达的光天化日之下被强抢财物不遂的右派暴徒当场开枪打死。在青岛市归国华侨二十一日举行的集会上，山东省侨联委员杨赞周说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力发动军事政变以来，在国内实行了骇人听闻的血腥大屠杀，接着又干出了一件一件的反华丑剧，我们要正告印度尼西亚反动派：不管你们怎么猖狂，你们只会和其他的反华丑角一样，得到可耻的下场。归侨们还以大量事实，揭穿了印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华、排华和迫害华侨的政治阴谋。印度尼西亚归侨、北京路小学教员徐敏先说，印度尼西亚政府把迫害华侨说成是什么“愤怒的人民大众的反应”。这是胡说八道，是推卸罪责。众所周知，现任印度尼西亚外交部长的马利克，就曾多次公开鼓动反华排华，而干出那些反华勾当的，实际上只是一小撮反动分子。我们告诉印度尼西亚反动派，迫害华侨是你们干的，这铁一般的事实，永远是赖不掉的。
    太原、南京、郑州等地的归侨和侨眷也举行了集会。山西省侨联主席刘琪、副秘书长宋晋荣、太原市侨联主席黄华、归侨许日清等在太原市归侨举行的集会上指出，印度尼西亚政府说什么华侨回国是“出于中国政府的命令或政治措施”，这种说法十分荒谬。华侨要求早日脱离虎口，返回祖国，这完全是印度尼西亚反动派迫害的结果。我国政府、已经回国的华侨，决不会看着自己的同胞在水深火热中惨遭迫害而置之不顾。中国政府的四项要求是完全合情合理的，完全正当的，完全符合国际法准则的，印度尼西亚政府必须迅速作出答复。在南京市归国华侨的集会上，许多受害华侨的家属，愤怒控诉印度尼西亚右派反动势力殴打、抢劫、绑架、屠杀他们亲人的滔天罪行。在河南省归国华侨联合会和郑州市归国华侨联合会联合举行的集会上，河南省归国华侨联合会副主席虎轩昌、郑州市侨联主席陈大明和许多归国华侨，在发言中声讨印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害华侨的滔天罪行。
