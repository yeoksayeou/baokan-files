    Just as the Johnson administration recalled U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, Lodge, for further consultations on expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique was intensifying and developing into a fierce internal struggle. This further undermined the Honolulu Plan, by which the United States sought to "stabilize" the South Vietnamese puppet regime.
    This infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique is actually a continuation of the ruling crisis of the Nguyễn Văn Thiệu - Nguyễn Cao Kỳ clique puppet regime in mid-April. At that time, the United States, through the Nguyễn Văn Thiệu - Nguyễn Cao Kỳ clique, staged a so-called "National Political Congress" farce, attempting to use deceptive means such as "general elections" and the establishment of a "civilian government" to ease the infighting within the puppet clique and induce the opposition to stop resisting the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ regime. However, this deceptive trick of the United States was quickly exposed by the Nguyễn Văn Thiệu - Nguyễn Cao Kỳ clique's actions of sending troops to Đà Nẵng, which further intensified the infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique.
    The Johnson administration was panicking, doing its best to conceal its role as the director, and hypocritically expressed its disapproval of the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ clique's actions, once again trotting out the United States' continued "support for the planned elections in South Vietnam," implementing new deceptions. This, of course, is futile. The Nguyễn Văn Thiệu - Nguyễn Cao Kỳ clique is a loyal running dog of U.S. imperialism. Nguyễn Cao Kỳ's dispatch of troops to Đà Nẵng was merely following the will of its U.S. master, attempting to use force to eliminate dissidents and achieve its goals of "unification" and "stability."
    The intensification of the South Vietnamese puppet infighting is the result of increasingly powerful blows by the South Vietnamese people. In South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has been driven to a dead end, both militarily and politically.

    都是绝路
    正当约翰逊政府召回美国驻南越“大使”洛奇，进一步磋商扩大侵越战争的时候，南越傀儡集团的内讧愈演愈烈，正在发展成一场激烈的火并。这使美国力图“稳定”南越傀儡政权的檀香山计划进一步趋于破产。
    这次南越傀儡集团的内讧，实际上是四月中旬阮文绍—阮高其集团伪政权统治危机的继续。当时美国曾经假手阮文绍—阮高其集团演出一幕所谓“全国政治代表大会”的丑剧，企图用“大选”、成立“文官政府”等欺骗手段来缓和傀儡集团的内讧，诱使反对派停止对阮高其政权的反抗。但是，美国这一欺骗伎俩，很快就被阮文绍—阮高其集团出兵岘港的行动所戳穿，结果使南越傀儡集团的内讧进一步激化。
    约翰逊政府惶惶不安，百般掩盖自己的导演者的面目，假惺惺地表示不赞成阮高其集团的做法，并且再一次端出什么美国的继续“支持南越计划中的选举”，实行新的欺骗。这当然是徒劳的。阮文绍—阮高其集团是美帝国主义的一条忠实的走狗。阮高其的出兵岘港，不过是秉承美国主子的意旨，企图用武力剪除异己，达到其“统一”和“稳定”的目的。
    南越傀儡内讧的加剧，是南越人民日益有力的打击的结果。美帝国主义在南越，无论在军事上，还是在政治上，都已经陷于绝路。
