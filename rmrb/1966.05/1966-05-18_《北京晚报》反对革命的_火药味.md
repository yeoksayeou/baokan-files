Title: The “Gunpowder Smell” of the *Beijing Evening News*'s Opposition to Revolution

    The *Beijing Evening News* was the main base for Deng Tuo and his gang's attacks on the Party and the people through *Yanshan Night Talks*, and it was Deng Tuo and his gang's tool for opposing the Party and socialism. It released a large amount of poison gas in Beijing and even throughout the country, spreading extremely bad influence, and has long been subjected to the resentment and dissatisfaction of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    In recent years, because I often wrote articles about revolutionary cultural relics for the *Beijing Evening News*, I deeply felt that the leaders of the *Beijing Evening News* were completely following the baton of Deng Tuo and his gang. They sometimes publish some revolutionary articles, but this is just a facade. The guiding ideology of our articles on revolutionary cultural relics is to emphasize the distinctness of the Mao Zedong banner, highlight the combativeness of the proletariat, and pay attention to the pertinence of revolutionary tradition education. However, the *Beijing Evening News* repeatedly asked us to first pay attention to its "storytelling," that is, to cater to the tastes of their "Boss Deng."

    I once wrote an article entitled *Blood-Stained Braid*, recounting how a poor peasant girl, after joining the anti-Japanese guerrilla force, cut off her braid to express her determination to carry out the revolution to the end. Later, she heroically sacrificed herself in battle. Her comrades-in-arms found the blood-stained braid in her arms and preserved it permanently to educate future generations never to forget class hatred. When this article was sent to the *Beijing Evening News*, the newspaper's leaders, after "reviewing" it, said, "Cutting off the braid cannot be regarded as expressing revolutionary determination." Thus, the article was returned. Soon after, I sent this article to the *Liberation Army Daily*. They published it quickly and even included it in the fourth collection of the *Liberation Army Daily Anthology*. It can be seen that the leaders of the *Beijing Evening News* always talk about "revolution," but in fact, they are most unwilling to smell the "gunpowder smell" of revolution. And Deng Tuo's "beautiful" "long hair" is regarded as a "masterpiece" in their minds. Therefore, they greatly publish those bourgeois revisionist, reactionary, and decadent things. From this specific example, we can see through whose world the *Beijing Evening News* is and whose position it is!

    Another time, I wrote a poem to accompany the revolutionary cultural relic "Red Army Family Certificate" and sent it to the *Beijing Evening News*. The newspaper's leaders, after reading it, said, "Writing a story is better than writing a poem." Thus, this article was returned again. A year later, I found this poem and sent it to the *Liberation Army Daily*. This poem was also published quickly. The reason why the *Beijing Evening News* did not publish this poem was not that "a story is better than a poem," but the real reason was that this poem was promoting revolution, which of course made the *Beijing Evening News* unbearable. What the *Beijing Evening News* wants is Deng Tuo's "spring breeze blowing dreams, lake waves sending warmth" and other "black swan" rubbish, as well as "wind sounds, rain sounds, reading sounds" and other black goods and poisons!

    Look, under the control of Deng Tuo, this small group of black shopkeepers, there is no sincerity in publicizing revolutionary struggle and revolutionary traditions! It is so difficult for us workers, peasants, and soldiers to write articles for them and want to seize a piece of ground on their position! Even if some are published, after their harsh digging and cutting, they become unrecognizable, weak, and powerless. If you ask them why they delete and revise so much, they will say with "sufficient reasons": "The layout is too crowded!" In fact, if our workers, peasants, and soldiers' articles fill their position, where will Deng Tuo and his ilk plant their poisonous weeds!

    In recent years, we have always felt that the taste of the *Beijing Evening News* is not right. Therefore, I have repeatedly pointed out to the *Beijing Evening News* in writing and orally that the articles they published do not highlight proletarian politics, violate Mao Zedong Thought, slander the People's Liberation Army, and distort revolutionary history. However, the *Beijing Evening News* never dared to publicly explain to readers. The *Beijing Evening News* does not listen to the opinions of readers, but pretends to be "modest" and repeatedly asked me to establish a "reading group" directly controlled by them among the soldiers in our company, nominally to listen to the soldiers' reflections on the *Beijing Evening News*, but in reality, to try to spread their poison gas. Of course, I could not agree to this approach and turned them away. If I went to help them establish a "reading group" in the company and let the soldiers read their "black talk" in large quantities, wouldn't I also become a "good citizen" of their "Three-Family Village"?

    We want to solemnly tell the *Beijing Evening News* that you are still only shouting slogans about exposing and settling accounts for your errors. This is far from enough! Observe its actions after listening to its words. You must first hand over the household registration book of the black shop, turn out the black accounts that Deng Tuo, the shopkeeper of the "Three-Family Village," gave you, reveal all the disgraceful black deeds, and completely open up the inside story of opposing the Party and socialism. We, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, must smash the "Three-Family Village" and must seize back the positions of the *Beijing Evening News*, *Frontline*, and *Beijing Daily*.

    《北京晚报》反对革命的“火药味”
    晓白
    《北京晚报》是邓拓一伙向党向人民进攻的《燕山夜话》主要阵地，是邓拓一伙的反党反社会主义的御用工具。它在北京以至全国施放了大量毒气，散布了极为恶劣的影响，早就受到广大工农兵读者的愤责和不满。
    这些年来，我由于经常给《北京晚报》写些革命文物的稿件，深深地感到《北京晚报》领导完全是按照邓拓一伙的指挥棒转的。他们有时也登点革命的稿件，这只不过是装装门面而已。我们写革命文物的稿件的指导思想，是强调毛泽东旗帜的鲜明性，突出无产阶级的战斗性，注意革命传统教育的针对性。而《北京晚报》却一再要我们首先注意它的“故事性”，也就是要作者去迎合他们的“邓老板”的趣味。
    我曾写了一篇《血染的发辫》的稿件，记述一个贫农姑娘参加抗日游击队后，剪去了自己的发辫，以表达她革命到底的决心，后来她在战斗中英勇牺牲了，战友们从她怀中发现了这条血染的发辫，并永久保存下来，教育后代永远不忘记阶级仇恨。这篇稿件寄到《北京晚报》，该报领导“审阅”后说：“剪掉辫子不能算表示革命决心”。这样，稿件就被退了回来。不久，我把这份稿件送到《解放军报》。他们很快就把它登载了，并且还把它编入《解放军报文选》第四集中。可见，《北京晚报》领导口口声声离不了“革命”，其实他们最不愿意闻革命的“火药味儿”。而邓拓写的“美”的“长发”，在他们心目中，却是捧为至宝的“杰作”。所以，他们就大登特登那些资产阶级修正主义反动腐朽透顶的东西。从这个具体的事例中，我们看透了《北京晚报》是谁家的天下，谁人的阵地！
    还有一次，我写了一首诗，配合革命文物“红军家属证”，寄给《北京晚报》。该报领导看过后说：“写诗不如故事好。”于是，这篇稿件又被退回来了。过了一年，我翻出了这首诗，又寄给《解放军报》。这首诗也很快就被刊出了。原来《北京晚报》不登这首诗，并不是什么“诗不如故事好”，真正原因是这首诗是宣传革命的，当然使《北京晚报》受不了。《北京晚报》所要的是象邓拓那样的什么“春风吹梦、湖波送暖”之类的“黑天鹅”，以及什么“风声、雨声、读书声”之类的黑货毒品！
    看，在邓拓这一小撮黑店掌柜的把持下的报纸，那里有宣传革命斗争和革命传统的真心！我们工农兵写给他们的稿件，想在他们的阵地上争夺一块地盘，是何等地不易啊！即便是有的被登了出来，经他们狠挖大割，也变得面目全非、软弱无力了。如果你要问他们为什么如此大删大改，他们会“理由十足”地说：“版面太挤了！”实际上，要是我们工农兵的稿件占满他们的阵地，那末邓拓之流的毒草往那儿栽呀！
    这些年来，我们总感到《北京晚报》的味儿不对劲。因此，我曾多次以书面和口头向《北京晚报》指出他们刊登的稿件中不突出无产阶级政治，违反毛泽东思想，诋毁解放军，歪曲革命历史。但是，《北京晚报》根本不敢公开向读者交代。《北京晚报》不听取读者的意见，却又装出一副“虚心”的态度，多次要求我为他们在我们连队战士当中建立一个直接由他们控制的“读报小组”，名为听取战士对《北京晚报》的反映，实则企图扩散他们的毒气。我当然不能同意这种做法，把他们顶了回去。如果我去帮他们在连队里去建立什么“读报小组”，让战士们大量地去读他们的“黑话”，那末我不也要成了他们的“三家村”的良民了么？
    我们要正告《北京晚报》，你们至今还仅仅是空喊要揭露呀，要清算错误呀。这是远远不够的！听其言必观其行，你们必须首先把黑店的户口本交出来，把“三家村”掌柜的邓拓交给你们的黑账翻出来，把一切见不得人的黑事揭出来，把反党反社会主义的内幕完全打开。我们工农兵群众一定要捣毁“三家村”，一定要夺回《北京晚报》和《前线》《北京日报》的阵地。
