    Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 21st -- Overseas Chinese workers and staff of the state-owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm held a rally on the 19th, resolutely supporting the note of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of our country, strongly protesting the Indonesian right-wing group's frantic anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities, and expressing a warm welcome to persecuted Overseas Chinese to voluntarily return to the motherland and join them in the socialist construction of the motherland.
    The state-owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm is a relatively large farm on Hainan Island with the largest number of returned Overseas Chinese. Among the Overseas Chinese workers and staff, Indonesian returned Overseas Chinese account for half. The returned Overseas Chinese are filled with righteous indignation at the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' organized, planned, and step-by-step large-scale persecution of Overseas Chinese, a fascist atrocity.
    Shao Lizhen, an Overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia in 1960, said in her accusation: "My parents, who lived in Indonesia, have always been upright and hardworking. During this anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces robbed my family's property and burned down my family's house. The Indonesian people understand, and the people all over the world also know very well, that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces persecuted my parents simply because they love the motherland and are committed to developing the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people."
    Zhou Quangen, a representative of the National People's Congress and an Indonesian returned Overseas Chinese, said that the Indonesian right-wing leaders massacred Overseas Chinese and hated China simply because our country adheres to an anti-imperialist stance. He said: "I was sold to Indonesia as a coolie when I was a teenager, mining and reclaiming wasteland in Indonesia, living like a beast of burden for thirty years, and being trampled underfoot by the Indonesian reactionaries. After returning to the motherland, the Party and Chairman Mao cared for us in every possible way, and I was even elected as a representative to the National People's Congress to discuss national affairs with Chairman Mao. This is truly like heaven and earth compared to being in Indonesia. All our workers and staff warmly welcome the victimized Overseas Chinese brothers to settle down in our farm."
    The returned Overseas Chinese workers and staff who participated in the rally expressed that they would conscientiously study Chairman Mao's writings, actively participate in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and actively make all preparations to welcome their relatives. They expressed their willingness to join the Indonesian victimized Overseas Chinese compatriots who have returned to the embrace of the motherland to jointly contribute their greatest strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    海南岛兴隆华侨农场归侨集会抗议印尼右派反华
    热烈欢迎受害印尼华侨归国参加建设
    新华社海口二十一日电  国营兴隆华侨农场的归侨职工十九日举行集会，坚决拥护我国外交部照会和我国华侨事务委员会声明，强烈抗议印度尼西亚右派集团疯狂反华、排华的暴行，表示热烈欢迎受害华侨自愿返回祖国，和他们一起参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    国营兴隆华侨农场是海南岛规模较大、归侨最多的农场，在归侨职工中，印度尼西亚归侨占一半。归侨们对印度尼西亚右派反动势力有组织、有计划、有步骤地大规模迫害华侨的法西斯暴行义愤填膺。
    一九六○年从印度尼西亚回国的归侨邵丽珍控诉说：“我旅居印度尼西亚的父母，一向正直，勤奋劳动，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在这次反华排华活动中抢劫了我家的财产，放火烧毁了我家的住房。印度尼西亚人民心里明白，全世界人民也很清楚，印度尼西亚右派反动势力迫害我的父母，无非是因为他们热爱祖国和致力于发展中国同印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊。”
    全国人民代表大会代表、印度尼西亚归侨周全根说，印度尼西亚右派头目屠杀华侨，仇恨中国，无非是因为我国坚持反帝立场。他说：“我是在十几岁的时候被卖到印度尼西亚当华工的，在印度尼西亚挖矿开荒，过了三十年的牛马生活，被印度尼西亚反动派踩在脚下。回到祖国后，党和毛主席无微不至地关怀我们，我还被选为全国人民代表大会代表，和毛主席一起讨论国家大事。这同在印度尼西亚真是天上地下之别。我们全场职工热烈欢迎受害的归侨兄弟到我们场来落户。”
    参加集会的归侨职工们纷纷表示，要认真学习毛主席著作，积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设，积极地作好一切准备迎接亲人。他们表示要和回到祖国怀抱的印度尼西亚受害侨胞一起，共同为祖国的社会主义建设贡献出最大力量。
