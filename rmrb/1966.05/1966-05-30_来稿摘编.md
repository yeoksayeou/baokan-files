    Excerpts from Incoming Submissions
    Deng Tuo told us "don't have preconceived notions" in the Great Cultural Revolution. What are the "preconceived notions" that Deng Tuo speaks of? They are the method of class analysis that Chairman Mao taught us, they are Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Tuo told us "don't have preconceived notions" because he wants us not to use class viewpoint to analyze the anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous weeds of the "Three-Family Village," not to criticize them with Mao Zedong Thought. This is the wishful thinking of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. In this sharp and complex class struggle of the Great Cultural Revolution, if we don't use class viewpoint, if we don't arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, we will be fooled by the enemy. Every proletarian revolutionary fighter must always listen to the Party, listen to Chairman Mao, use Mao Zedong Thought to expose the enemy's conspiracies and eliminate all poisonous weeds.

    Deng Tuo said, "Don't listen to anyone casually," which is obviously with ulterior motives. The "anyone" that Deng Tuo speaks of is the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. He wants us "not to listen to anyone casually" because he wants us not to listen to the Party Central Committee, not to listen to Chairman Mao, but to listen to the likes of Deng Tuo, and become tools for them to oppose the Party and socialism. Since Deng Tuo attacks our Party, attacks socialism, just like landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, we must "do the opposite." What he wants us "not to listen to casually," we must listen to; what he wants us to listen to, we not only won't listen to, but we must also thoroughly criticize.

    I was born into a poor peasant family. My parents died when I was seven years old, and I begged for food and wandered everywhere. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued me from the sea of bitterness. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I would have been buried long ago. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and this gang of anti-Party elements viciously attacked the Party and Chairman Mao, and called for our Party to "step down," which is really infuriating. Now, I am still sick and cannot go to work, and my education level is very low. I have never written a letter before. However, I can't worry about these things. This is the first time I picked up a pen to write this letter to the Party newspaper, to express the determination of our working class: No matter who it is, if they attack our beloved Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, our working class will fight them to the end, even if it costs our lives.

    邓拓叫我们在文化大革命中“不要先有框框”。邓拓所说的“框框”是什么？就是毛主席告诉我们的阶级分析的方法，就是毛泽东思想。邓拓叫我们“不要先有框框”，就是要我们对“三家村”反党反社会主义的毒草，不要用阶级观点去分析，不要用毛泽东思想去批判。这是“三家村”黑帮的痴心妄想。在文化大革命这场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，不用阶级观点，不用毛泽东思想来武装我们的头脑，我们就会上敌人的当。每个无产阶级革命战士，一定要永远听党的话，听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想去戳破敌人的阴谋诡计，铲除一切毒草。

    邓拓说：“不要随便听谁的话”，显然是别有用心的。邓拓所说的“谁”，就是党中央和毛主席。他要我们“不要随便听谁的话”，就是要我们不要听党中央的话，不要听毛主席的话，而要听邓拓之流的话，充当他们反党反社会主义的工具。邓拓既然和地富反坏右、帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派一模一样攻击我们的党，攻击社会主义，对他的言行，就要“反其道而行之”。他要我们“不随便听”的，我们就要听；他要我们听的，我们不但不听，而且还要进行彻底批判。

    我出身于一个雇农家庭，七岁时死去了父母，一个人要饭，到处流浪。共产党和毛主席，把我从苦海里救了出来。没有共产党和毛主席，我早就给埋了。邓拓、吴晗这伙反党分子恶毒地攻击党和毛主席，叫我们党“下台”，真叫人气愤。现在，我正在病中，还不能上班，加上我的文化水平很低，从前信都没写过一封。但是，我顾不得这些，第一次拿起笔来写这封信给党报，表示咱们工人阶级的决心：不管是谁，要攻击我们敬爱的党中央和伟大的领袖毛主席，我们工人阶级拼着命也要和他坚决斗争到底。
