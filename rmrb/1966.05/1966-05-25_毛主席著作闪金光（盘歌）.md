    The wind fills the sails and the fish fill the holds,
    The light shines on the hills,
    Barren hills become gold and silver hills;
    The light shines on the fields,
    The crops are strong in all seasons;
    The light shines in our hearts,
    Every red heart faces the Party,
    With one heart and one mind for the revolution,
    We will transform the world into paradise!
