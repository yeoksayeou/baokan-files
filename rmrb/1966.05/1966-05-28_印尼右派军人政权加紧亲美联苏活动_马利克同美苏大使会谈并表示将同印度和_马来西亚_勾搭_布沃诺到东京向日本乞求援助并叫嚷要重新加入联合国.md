    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 27th: The Indonesian right-wing military regime is intensifying its pro-US, pro-Soviet, and colluding with imperialist running dogs activities.
    Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik recently held secret talks with the US and Soviet ambassadors to Indonesia one after another. Malik's talks with US Ambassador Green were held on the 24th. It was revealed that the content of the talks included the issue of Indonesia importing rice from the United States. On the same day, according to the United States Information Service, the US Department of Agriculture announced that, under the so-called "Food for Peace Program," the United States decided to provide Indonesia with long-term loans to import 45,000 tons of rice from the United States.
    Malik then held talks with the Soviet Ambassador to Indonesia on the 25th. It is said that the two sides discussed Malik's visit to the Soviet Union.
    According to Reuters, Malik revealed on the 25th that he will soon go to Bangkok to meet with "Malaysia" Deputy Prime Minister Razak. He said that the purpose of the talks was to end Indonesia's three-year confrontation with "Malaysia". Malik also admitted on the 24th that the Indonesian right-wing military regime had sent a "messenger" to "Malaysia" for this purpose and met with Razak. He said that this "messenger" had successfully completed his mission and conveyed the message that the Indonesian Foreign Minister was ready to come to the conference table.
    Prior to this, on April 29th, on the same day that Britain announced it would provide the Indonesian right-wing military regime with one million pounds of "emergency aid," Malik suddenly flew from Jakarta to Bangkok, and held talks with Philippine Foreign Minister Ramos on April 30th and May 1st. The joint communique issued after the talks showed that Malik's trip to Bangkok was to find a way to compromise with "Malaysia". The joint communique stated that Malik said during the talks that the Indonesian government was willing to "find a peaceful solution to the Malaysian issue."
    Malik also revealed earlier the Indonesian right-wing military regime's request to collude with the Indian government. According to the Indian newspaper The Statesman on the 21st, Malik told the newspaper's Jakarta correspondent that he would stop in New Delhi en route to Moscow in June. Malik said that the three main issues he would discuss with Indian government leaders were: "the situation in Southeast Asia, the Non-Aligned Movement and Indonesia's desire to play a more active role in this movement, and Indonesia's re-entry into the United Nations."
    Malik also "welcomed" the Indian government's formal announcement on the 19th that it would grant Indonesia a loan of 100 million rupees in his speech. He said: "If you give more, it would be even better." Malik also gave a speech to right-wing student organizations on the 23rd, again declaring that Indonesia would soon rejoin the United Nations. He said: "Such a return is beneficial, not a loss."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 25th: The economic delegation led by Hamengkubuwono, the fourth deputy prime minister of the Indonesian government, arrived in Tokyo by plane on the evening of the 24th.
    At Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Buwono told reporters that he hoped that during the visit, regarding the issue of Japan's "economic assistance" to Indonesia, "a final decision will be made based on the consideration of the Japanese government." Buwono also stated that Indonesia would soon rejoin the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations controlled by the United States. Buwono and his party will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina, Director General of the Economic Planning Agency Aiichiro Fujiyama, Finance Minister Takeo Fukuda, and Minister of International Trade and Industry Takeo Miki respectively, and will hold a round table meeting on the 27th.

    印尼右派军人政权加紧亲美联苏活动
    马利克同美苏大使会谈并表示将同印度和“马来西亚”勾搭
    布沃诺到东京向日本乞求援助并叫嚷要重新加入联合国
    据新华社二十七日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在加紧进行亲美联苏和同帝国主义走狗相勾结的活动。
    印度尼西亚外交部长阿达姆·马利克最近接连同美国和苏联驻印度尼西亚大使举行秘密会谈。马利克同美国大使格林的会谈，是在二十四日举行的。据透露，会谈内容包括印度尼西亚从美国进口大米的问题。当天，据美国新闻处报道，美国农业部宣布，根据所谓“粮食用于和平计划”，美国决定向印度尼西亚提供长期贷款，以便从美国进口四万五千吨大米。
    马利克接着在二十五日同苏联驻印度尼西亚大使举行会谈，据说，双方讨论了马利克访问苏联的问题。
    据路透社报道，马利克二十五日透露，他不久将去曼谷，同“马来西亚”副总理拉扎克会谈。他说，会谈的目的是结束印度尼西亚对“马来西亚”三年来的对抗。马利克二十四日还承认，印度尼西亚右派军人政权为此已向“马来西亚”派遣了“信使”，并会见了拉扎克。他说，这个“信使”已成功地完成了他的使命，转达了这样的信息：印度尼西亚外交部长准备到会议桌上来。
    在这之前，四月二十九日，在英国宣布向印度尼西亚右派军人政权提供一百万英镑的“紧急援助”的同一天，马利克突然从雅加达飞往曼谷，并在四月三十日和五月一日同菲律宾外交部长拉莫斯举行了会谈。会谈后发表的联合公报表明，马利克的曼谷之行是为了寻找同“马来西亚”实行妥协的途径。联合公报说，马利克在会谈中表示，印度尼西亚政府愿意“寻找一个和平解决马来西亚问题的办法”。
    马利克早些时候还透露了印度尼西亚右派军人政权同印度政府勾搭的要求。据印度《政治家报》二十一日报道，马利克对这家报纸驻雅加达记者说，他六月间前往莫斯科途中将在新德里停留。马利克说，他将同印度政府领导人讨论的三个主要问题是：“东南亚局势，不结盟俱乐部和印度尼西亚要在这个俱乐部中起更积极的作用的愿望，印度尼西亚重新加入联合国的问题”。
    马利克在讲话中还对印度政府十九日正式宣布答应给印度尼西亚一亿卢比贷款“表示欢迎”。他说：“如果你们多给一些，那就更好”。马利克二十三日还对右派学生组织发表谈话，再次宣称印度尼西亚不久将重新加入联合国。他说：“这样的返回是有利的，而不是损失”。
    据新华社东京二十五日电　由印度尼西亚政府第四副总理哈孟库·布沃诺率领的经济代表团，二十四日晚上坐飞机到达东京。
    布沃诺在东京羽田机场向新闻记者表示，希望在访问期间，关于日本给予印度尼西亚的“经济援助”问题，“将根据日本政府的照顾，作出最后决定”。布沃诺还表示，印度尼西亚最近将重新加入美国控制的联合国和国际货币基金组织等国际机构。布沃诺一行将同日本首相佐藤荣作、外务大臣椎名悦三郎、经济企划厅长宫藤山爱一郎、财政大臣福田赳夫和通商产业大臣三木武夫分别举行会谈，并在二十七日举行圆桌会议。
