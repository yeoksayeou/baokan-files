    Deng Tuo and his gang of black elements in "Evening Talks at Yanshan" and "Notes from Three-Family Village" tried every possible means to corrupt our youth and promote the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution." First, they slandered Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to confuse the youth and prevent them from arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. They also meticulously designed a dark path for the youth—luring them to become "new-type collectors," delving into old papers and pursuing the decadent bourgeois low tastes. We must thoroughly smash this conspiracy of Deng Tuo and his gang of black elements.
    We Must Never Become Successors of the Bourgeoisie
    —Exposing the "Three-Family Village's" Conspiracy to Deceive Youth and Carry Out "Peaceful Evolution"

    We warmly endorse Comrade Yao Wenyuan's exposure and criticism of Deng Tuo and his gang of black elements in the article "Comment on 'Three-Family Village.'" This article is well written, and it severely hit the vital point of Deng Tuo and his gang of black elements.
    Deng Tuo and his partners, in "Evening Talks at Yanshan" and "Notes from Three-Family Village," under the guise of spreading "knowledge" and "learning," and adopting the method of "cutting off heads with soft knives," tried every possible means to corrupt our youth, vainly attempting to lure the youth into the "Three-Family Village" black shop, push them into the revisionist quagmire, and use them as the social foundation for their realization of capitalist restoration. Their words are extremely sweet, but their hearts are extremely poisonous. We must drag them into the broad daylight and see their black hearts in order to completely eradicate this big poisonous weed.
    The corruption of the youth by Deng Tuo and his gang of black elements begins with trying every possible means to make the youth abandon Mao Zedong Thought. With deep proletarian feelings, we eagerly read Chairman Mao's books, regarding them as the supreme instructions for all actions. However, Deng Tuo actually slandered the great Mao Zedong Thought as "empty talk," saying, "If it is popularized, repeated everywhere, and even used as a specialty, it would be quite terrible"; saying, "If we teach this skill of empty talk to our descendants and cultivate such a group of experts, it would be even worse." These words of Deng Tuo viciously slander Mao Zedong Thought, which guides our progress, attempting to confuse our youth: do not arm your minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and do not become experts in "empty talk."
    Then, what does Deng Tuo want us to learn? In his article "The Merits of Collectors," he undisguisedly said: "...until today, in the socialist Soviet Union, we can see completely new types of collectors appearing in society," "For example, there is one named Slavsky," "who actually collected hundreds of Chaplin's photos and related magazine and newspaper clippings, ...etc." He was even afraid that people would not believe him, and he further guaranteed: "Even in the future communist society, such new-style collectors and their collecting activities will still not disappear; on the contrary, they may further develop and improve, becoming more widespread and diversified." Here, Deng Tuo vigorously promotes "new-type collectors" to the youth. Is it to introduce some fresh things? No, definitely not. "The old drunkard's real intention is not the wine." This is the same stuff as his "Three-Family Village's" talk about cats and dogs, praising landlords, playing with antiques, playing mahjong, and doing business. It is also to guide the youth to eating, drinking, and having fun, alienating us from Mao Zedong Thought, weakening our revolutionary will, and gradually becoming corrupt, degenerate, and evolve into new bourgeois elements.
    The sugar-coated bullets used by Deng Tuo to corrupt the youth are truly colorful and diverse. If you have no intention of becoming a "new-type collector," then he launches another set: "do scholarship." Our Party has never opposed anyone's efforts to enrich their knowledge and skills to serve the people, and it advocates that young people should be both red and expert, and have the knowledge and skills to engage in the three major revolutionary movements. But how does Deng Tuo want us to "do scholarship"? In his article "A Small Key," he said: "To specialize in a subject, or to study a specific issue, one must read all the books and materials related to this subject or issue." He wants us to shut ourselves up, not care about the affairs of the world, bury ourselves in reading, and read all the relevant materials, but only not to read Chairman Mao's books, because they think that is "empty talk," "stereotyped writing," and "clichés." This is a great slander. Young comrades, take a look. Deng Tuo wants us to leave Mao Zedong Thought and delve into books. Isn't this to make us leave the revolutionary road, leave socialism, and become the successors of the bourgeois intellectuals?
    If you neither want to be a "new-type collector" nor are you interested in "doing scholarship," then Deng Tuo has other decadent bourgeois low tastes to lure you in and corrupt your thoughts. Please see "a letter from a student at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute." This "student" is dominated by bourgeois ideology, full of low tastes, paying special attention to how long a woman's hair is on a "public bus," asking Deng Tuo to "talk about what inspiration such long hair has for us." Deng Tuo immediately wrote a rotten, typical juvenile delinquent work, not only supporting this "student" but also digging out various "beauties'" "long hair" from the court life of the most decadent emperors of all dynasties to make a big advertisement. Isn't this a vivid example?
    In short, Deng Tuo and his gang carefully designed a dark path for the youth, deliberately trying to lead us into the quagmire of revisionism, and become the organizational force and social foundation for the "Three-Family Village" group to recruit troops and buy horses to promote "peaceful evolution." Truly, their mouths are as sweet as honey, but their hearts are as poisonous as scorpions. However, with Mao Zedong Thought as our sharp weapon, we can completely recognize their various conspiracies and tricks. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely stand with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and thoroughly smash the vicious conspiracy of the "Three-Family Village" black gang to promote peaceful evolution!

    邓拓一伙黑帮在《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》中，千方百计地腐蚀我们青年，推行“和平演变”的阴谋。他们首先污蔑毛泽东思想，企图迷惑青年不要用毛泽东思想武装头脑。他们还精心地为青年设计了一条黑路——引诱青年做“新型收藏家”，钻故纸堆，追求腐朽透顶的资产阶级低级趣味。我们一定要彻底粉碎邓拓一伙黑帮的这种阴谋

    ——揭穿“三家村”迷惑青年实行“和平演变”的阴谋
    上海合成纤维研究所红雷青年小组
    我们热烈赞同姚文元同志在《评“三家村”》文章中对邓拓这伙黑帮的揭露和批驳。这篇文章写得好，它狠狠地击中了邓拓这伙黑帮的要害。
    邓拓和他的合伙者，在《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》中，以传播“学问”、“知识”作幌子，采取“软刀子割头”的办法，千方百计腐蚀我们青年，妄图把青年诱入“三家村”黑店，推进修正主义泥坑，作为他们实现资本主义复辟的社会基础。他们其言极甜，其心极毒。我们必须把他们拖到光天化日之下，看看他们的黑心肠，以彻底铲除这棵大毒草。
    邓拓这一伙黑帮对青年人的腐蚀，首先是千方百计使青年离开毛泽东思想。我们怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，如饥似渴地读毛主席的书，把毛主席的书当作一切行动的最高指示。但是，邓拓竟然把伟大的毛泽东思想污蔑为“空话”，说什么“如果把它普遍化起来，到处搬弄，甚至于以此为专长，那就相当可怕了”；说什么“假若再把这种说空话的本领教给我们的后代，培养出这么一批专家，那就更糟糕了”。邓拓的这些话，刻毒地污蔑指引着我们前进的毛泽东思想，企图迷惑我们青年人：不要用毛泽东思想武装头脑，不要成为说“空话”的专家。
    那么，邓拓要我们学习什么呢？他在《收藏家的功绩》一文中毫不掩饰地说：“……直到今天，在社会主义的苏联，我们可以看到完全新型的收藏家出现在社会上”，“例如，有一个名叫斯拉夫斯基的”，“居然，收集了几百张卓别林的照片和有关的杂志报纸的剪页，……等等”。他还生怕人家不信他这一套，又进一步拍胸脯担保：“即便到了将来的共产主义社会，这样新式的收藏家和他们的收藏活动，仍然不会消失；相反的，倒有可能进一步发展和提高，变得更加普遍化和多样化起来。”在这里，邓拓向青年大肆宣扬什么“新型收藏家”，难道是为了介绍一些新鲜事情吗？不，决不是。“醉翁之意不在酒”，这跟他们“三家村”这一伙谈猫吹狗，捧地主，玩古董，打麻将，做买卖那一套是同样货色，也是要把青年引导到吃喝玩乐上面去，使我们同毛泽东思想疏远，革命意志衰退，一步步走向腐化堕落，蜕化变质，演变成新的资产阶级分子。
      邓拓腐蚀青年的糖衣炮弹，真是五颜六色，种类多得很。如果你无意于做“新型收藏家”，那么，他打出另外一套：去“做学问”。我们党从来不反对一个人要努力充实为人民服务的学问和本领，而且提倡青年要又红又专，要有从事三大革命运动的学问和本事。但是，邓拓叫我们怎样“做学问”呢？他在《一把小钥匙》一文中说：“要想专攻一门学问，或者专门研究一个问题，就必须读尽这一门学问或这一个问题有关的一切图书资料。”他要我们关起门来，不问天下事，埋头读书，把有关的资料都读尽，但是唯独不能读毛主席的书，因为他们认为那是“空话”，“八股”，“陈词滥调”。这是绝大的污蔑。青年同志们看一看，邓拓要我们离开毛泽东思想去钻书堆，这不是要我们离开革命的道路，离开社会主义，去做资产阶级知识分子的接班人吗？
    如果你既不想做“新型的收藏家”，又没有兴趣“做学问”，那末，邓拓还有其他腐朽透顶的资产阶级低级趣味来引你上钩，腐蚀你的思想。请看“北京广播学院的一个同学来信”。这个“同学”被资产阶级思想支配了，满脑袋低级趣味，专门注意“公共汽车”上某个女人的头发多么长，要邓拓“说说这样的长发对我们有一点什么启发”。邓拓立刻写了一篇腐烂的典型的阿飞作品，不但支持了这个“同学”，而且从历代最糜烂的皇帝的宫廷生活中挖出各种“美人”的“长发”来大做广告。这不是活生生的例子吗？
    总之，邓拓一伙人精心地为青年设计了一条黑路，处心积虑地要把我们引向修正主义的泥坑，成为“三家村”集团招兵买马推行“和平演变”的组织力量和社会基础。真是嘴甜象蜜糖，心毒如蛇蝎。但是，我们凭着毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，完全能够识别他们的各种阴谋诡计。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决和工农兵站在一起，彻底粉碎“三家村”这一黑帮推行和平演变的恶毒阴谋！
