    Five young men take their posts,
    Singing all the way until dawn breaks,
    Sparks fly as the song lands,
    The song circles the steel beams in the sky,
    The song reaches the furnace platform,
    The rolling mill's roar can't match its sound!
    One sings: The furnace door rises, emitting red light,
    Just like "our" Shanghai Port,
    Rows of cranes compete in strength,
    Striving to hold up the red sun!
    Another sings: Looking at the rolling mill from the control panel,
    It's like a mountain range rising from a sea of clouds,
    Golden rays accompany silver mist,
    The red-hot billet is exceptionally bright,
    Just like watching the sunrise before Mount Emei,
    The red sun clings to the mountain's back!
    Hearing his comrades praise their hometowns,
    The one from the vast Gobi rushes to speak,
    Have any of you seen—
    A rainbow spanning the desert?!
    The sunrise isn't as beautiful, the full moon isn't as bright!
    Now we wave our handwheels,
    And the "long rainbow" shines before our eyes!
    Hearing his comrades praise their jobs,
    The printing worker from the South China Sea gets anxious:
    The fish season tide in the South China Sea is the loudest,
    Tens of thousands of fishing nets scoop up the ocean,
    Sheets of white sails cut through the giant waves,
    Sounds of conches are so magnificent!
    Look at the fine steel on our conveyor belt,
    Doesn't it resemble hundreds of millions of fish leaping into the hold?
    Red steel is beautiful, red steel is bright,
    Just like the big red lanterns on Tiananmen Square,
    Shining day and night!
    The fifth young man barely begins to speak,
    The steam whistle shouts with its shrill voice:
    Five young men take their posts!
    Step! Step! Step!
    Five young men take their posts,
    Five pairs of footsteps sound the same!
    Iron stairs, iron railings, iron control panels,
    Are all shaken straight!
    Step! Step! Step!
    Five young men take their posts,
    Five pairs of big hands are equally strong!
    Steel handwheels, steel wrenches, steel control levers,
    Follow the young men forward!
    Work! Work! Work!
    Five young men are at their posts,
    Five red hearts are close to the Party,
    Different accents sing the same tune,
    Bearing the heavy burden of revolution on their shoulders!
