	With the Determination to Eliminate the "Three Pests," Destroy the "Three-Family Village"
	—Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants of Lankao County, Henan Province, Angrily Denounce Deng Tuo and His Gang of Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Elements
	In recent days, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Lankao County, where Comrade Jiao Yulu worked during his lifetime, have held座谈 (zuòtán, discussion forums) filled with class hatred, criticizing the crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. They expressed their determination to destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop with the same resolution they had to eliminate the "three pests," and to use the shovels they used to seal sand dunes and reclaim saline-alkali land to dig out this group of bad guys, discredit and overthrow them, and eradicate them completely.
  Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Can Never Be Separated from the Party and Chairman Mao
	The poor and lower-middle peasants of Lankao County expressed extreme anger at Deng Tuo's cursing of our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao. Yan Xichong, representative of the provincial poor and lower-middle peasants and director of the Poor Peasants Association of Tangzhai Brigade, Xiaosong Commune, said: "When I heard that Deng Tuo, this bad egg, wanted the Party and Chairman Mao to 'rest,' I was so angry my stomach almost exploded. These past few days, the more I think about it, the more I hate him. In the past, my family had been begging for three generations, and my father only wore one cotton-padded coat his whole life, wearing 'lantern pants' in the heavy snow, and the whole family of six lived in a dilapidated thatched hut." Speaking here, Yan Xichong broke down in tears. He pointed to the scar on his leg, bitten by a landlord's vicious dog when he was begging, and said, "You see, this is the evidence of the old society. After liberation, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to turn over, with food and clothing, and living in a new tile-roofed house. My own father and mother are not as close as the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Our poor and lower-middle peasants can never forget the Communist Party, and can never forget Chairman Mao." He gritted his teeth and said, "Deng Tuo, you bad egg, you want to overthrow the Communist Party and prevent the poor peasants from living a good life. This is wishful thinking, a pipe dream, and will never happen." Liu Zongxing, the first poor peasant hero recommended to the whole county by Comrade Jiao Yulu during his lifetime and the feeder of Zhaoduolou Brigade, Zhangjunmu Commune, was both angry and hateful after hearing Deng Tuo and others' reactionary remarks viciously attacking the Party and Chairman Mao. He said: "Deng Tuo, you fellow, you eat human food but don't speak human words. The gourd is full of bad medicine. You dare to attack Chairman Mao. I will never spare you. Everyone knows that Chairman Mao is our savior. Without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, there would be no Liu Zongxing. Before liberation, I worked as a hired hand for the landlord. A family of seven didn't have a single house, and I didn't even have a proper name until I was over forty. Who treated us like human beings? Only after liberation did we raise our heads and take control of the seal. In the difficult years a few years ago, I received many commendations from the Party for feeding a few livestock for the team, and I was even asked to make a report on my experience to the whole county. Without the Communist Party, where would I be today? Deng Tuo, you want the Communist Party to step down. I will fight you to the end, even at the cost of my life."
	
	The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Trust the Party Most and Listen to the Party's Words Most
	Many poor and lower-middle peasants sternly refuted Deng Tuo's reactionary remarks slandering our Party as "untrustworthy" and "unreliable." Cao Yuying, Director of the Women's Federation of Tushanzhai Brigade, Hongmiao Commune, said: "The poor and lower-middle peasants trust the Party most and listen to the Party's words most. The Party is our guide, first leading us onto the road of agricultural collectivization, and then establishing the People's Communes. Collective production is getting better and better, and our lives are getting richer and richer. In the years when we suffered from disasters, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements took the opportunity to sabotage the collective economy and stirred up a gust of wind of individual farming. At this time, Jiao Yulu, Chairman Mao's good student, led a work team to our brigade, relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and repelled the attack of the class enemies, consolidating the collective economy. Later, he led us to carry out basic farmland construction and march towards stable and high yields, with grain production rising year after year. Deng Tuo, can you point to anything that was not done under the leadership of the Party? How can you say the Party is not trustworthy? You are completely instigating, and we will not be fooled by you and listen to your nonsense!" You Futian, Director of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Representative Association of Zhangzhuang Brigade, Zhaoying Commune, said: "The Party says what it can do, and it is most trustworthy. Our brigade is a sandy area. When the wind blows, the yellow sand fills the sky, destroying many crops every year. The masses urgently demand to control the sandstorms. In the spring of 1963, the Party led us to use only three months to seal all eleven sand dunes in the brigade, covering an area of more than 1,400 mu, with silt and planted trees. It stopped the harm of the sandstorms, and grain production increased several times. Deng Tuo, tell me, which dynasty or generation has done such a thing? The Communist Party does what it says. You say the Party is not trustworthy, which is completely inflammatory. We will not be fooled by you and listen to your lies!"

	The Party and Chairman Mao Trust the People Most
	The anti-Party element Deng Tuo slandered our great Party as "self-righteous," "looking down on the masses," and "not accepting the good opinions of the masses below," arousing strong resentment among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhao Xinzhen, Secretary of the Party Branch of Qinzhai Brigade, Guyang Commune, said: "Deng Tuo, what are you saying about our Party not accepting the good opinions of the masses? This is complete nonsense. Take Comrade Jiao Yulu's leadership in our Lankao's struggle to eliminate the 'three pests,' for example. In order to find out the details of the 'three pests,' he personally led an investigation team to various places to investigate and visit. Everywhere he went, he held座谈 (zuòtán, discussion forums) of the poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly listened to the opinions of the masses, and summed up the experience of eliminating the 'three pests' bit by bit, gathered them together, and promoted them. After Comrade Jiao Yulu discovered our brigade's practice of deep plowing and pressing alkali, he attached great importance to it and quickly promoted it throughout the county, and also designated our brigade as one of the four red flags in the county. Deng Tuo, I ask you, can you say that our Party looks down on the masses? Aren't you just telling lies with your eyes wide open?" Zhang Honghua, Director of the Women's Federation of Xiawuying Brigade, Hongmiao Commune, said: "The Party trusts us poor and lower-middle peasants most, and every policy of the Party is formulated based on the opinions and demands of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is our wish. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, our brigade has realized garden-style farmland. Grain production has increased from more than 200 jin in the past to more than 400 jin. Deng Tuo, who are you referring to when you say 'the masses'? Isn't it referring to us working people? It's referring to the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Our Party will never listen to the opinions of the 'masses' you are talking about."
	
	The Party and Chairman Mao Cherish Labor Power Most
	Deng Tuo viciously slandered our Party as not knowing how to "cherish labor power." Many poor and lower-middle peasants also refuted these black words. Sun Yutang, representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xugongzhuang Production Team, Chengguan Commune, said: "Deng Tuo is scolding our Party as being not as good as the landlord class in feudal society in 'cherishing labor power.' Isn't this standing on the landlord class's position and speaking up for the landlords? In the old society, the landlords relied on drinking the blood of the poor to get rich. They only hated that they exploited too little. How could they talk about 'cherishing labor power'? I fled from another place to Xugongzhuang and worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. All year round, I worked myself to death, was beaten and scolded, and still couldn't get warm. This is proof!" Yang Sulan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Hancun Brigade, Chengguan Commune, said: "Our Party knows best how to cherish labor power. The number of workdays each commune member works each month is decided by the commune members themselves through discussion. There are also holidays every month, and women have maternity leave when they give birth. The Party and government are very concerned when commune members have difficulties in their lives. In the past few years when we encountered serious natural disasters, the Party and the state transported a large amount of grain and supplies from other places. Everything we eat, burn, and use is planned for us in every detail. How can you say the Party doesn't cherish us? Deng Tuo, you are purely slandering us."
	
	At various gatherings and座谈 (zuòtán, discussion forums), many poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out that Deng Tuo and his gang are frantically anti-Party and anti-socialist, singing the same tune as domestic and foreign class enemies, and are bad eggs molded from the same mold. No matter what tricks you gang of gangsters play, we will completely defeat you. We will never stop until we win complete victory!

    以除“三害”的决心捣毁“三家村”
    ——河南省兰考县贫下中农怒斥邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子
    近日来，焦裕禄同志生前工作过的兰考县的广大贫下中农，满怀阶级仇恨，纷纷举行座谈，批判邓拓等一伙反党反社会主义的罪行。他们表示要以除“三害”的决心，捣毁“三家村”黑店，要用封沙丘、翻盐碱地的铁锹，把这一群坏家伙挖出来，斗臭斗垮，连根拔除。
  贫下中农永远离不开党和毛主席
    兰考县的贫下中农，对邓拓咒骂我们伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席表示万分愤怒。省贫下中农代表、小宋公社唐寨大队贫协主任阎协崇说：邓拓这个坏货要叫党和毛主席“休息”，我一听肚子都气炸啦，这几天，越想越恨。过去俺家三辈都逃荒要饭，我爹一辈子只穿过一件棉袄，大雪天穿的是“灯笼裤”，全家六口人住一个破草庵子。说到这里，阎协崇痛哭失声，他指着自己要饭时腿上被地主恶狗咬伤的疤痕说，你们看，这就是旧社会的罪证。解放后，共产党，毛主席领导俺翻了身，有吃有穿，住上了新瓦房，爹亲娘亲都没有共产党毛主席亲，咱贫下中农祖祖辈辈都不能忘记共产党、都不能忘记毛主席。他咬牙切齿地说，邓拓你这个坏家伙，想推翻共产党，不叫贫农过好日子，这是白天作梦瞎想，永远办不到。焦裕禄同志生前向全县推荐的第一个贫农英雄、张君墓公社赵垛楼大队的饲养员刘宗行，听到邓拓等人恶毒攻击党和毛主席的反动言论以后，又气又恨。他说：邓拓你这个家伙，吃人饭不说人话，葫芦里装的净是坏药，你竟敢攻击毛主席，俺决不饶你。谁都知道毛主席是咱的救命恩人，离了共产党、离了毛主席，就没有我刘宗行。解放前，我给地主扛活，一家七口人没有一间房子，四十多岁啦还没个大名，谁把咱当人看。解放后，才抬起头来了，掌握了印把子，在前几年困难时期，我给队里喂几头牲口，就受到党多次表扬，还让我在全县作报告介绍经验。要没有共产党，我那有今天。邓拓你想叫共产党下台，我拼上老命也要和你干到底。
    贫下中农最信任党、最听党的话
    许多贫下中农对邓拓辱骂我们党“言而无信”、“不堪信任”的反动言论进行了严厉的驳斥。红庙公社土山寨大队妇联主任曹玉英说：贫下中农最信任党，最听党的话。党是我们的领路人，先领导我们走上了农业集体化的道路，以后又成立了人民公社，集体生产越来越好，生活越来越富裕。前几年遭灾，地、富、反、坏分子乘机破坏集体经济，刮起了一股单干风。这时毛主席的好学生——焦裕禄带领工作组来到俺大队，依靠贫下中农，打退了阶级敌人的进攻，巩固了集体经济。后来，又领导俺们进行农田基本建设，向稳产高产进军，粮食产量年年上升。邓拓，你看哪一项不是党领导我们干出来的，这能说党不可信任吗？爪营公社张庄大队贫下中农代表协会主任尤富田说：党说得出，就做得到，最可信任。俺大队是个沙区，大风一起黄沙满天，每年都打毁不少庄稼，群众迫切要求治住风沙。一九六三年春天，党领导我们只用了三个月的时间，就把全大队的十一个沙丘，面积一千四百多亩，用淤泥全部封住，并栽上了树。制止了风沙的危害，粮食产量就成倍的增长。邓拓你说哪一朝、哪一代办过这样的事？共产党说办就办到了。你说党不可信任，完全是煽动，我们不会上你的当，听你的鬼话！
    党和毛主席最相信人民群众
    反党分子邓拓诬蔑我们伟大的党“自作聪明”，“看不起群众”，“不接受下面群众的好意见”，激起了广大贫下中农的强烈愤恨。堌阳公社秦砦大队党支部书记赵新贞说：邓拓你说什么我们党不接受群众的好意见，这完全是胡说八道。就以焦裕禄同志领导我们兰考除“三害”的斗争来说吧，为了摸清“三害”的底细，他亲自带领调查队，到各地调查访问，每到一处，都召开贫下中农座谈会，虚心听取群众的意见，一点一滴地总结除“三害”的经验，集中起来，加以推广。俺大队深翻压碱的作法，焦裕禄同志发现以后，非常重视，很快就在全县推广，还把俺们大队作为全县四杆红旗之一。邓拓，我问你，这能说我们党看不起群众吗？你不是瞪着两眼说瞎话吗？红庙公社夏武营大队妇联主任张红花说：党最相信我们贫下中农，党的每一项方针政策都是根据我们贫下中农的意见和要求制订的。鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，就是我们的心愿。俺们大队，在总路线的光辉照耀下，实现了园田化。粮食产量已由过去的二百多斤提高到四百多斤。邓拓，你所说的“群众”是什么人？不是指的俺劳动人民，是指的地富反坏右。我们党永远也不会听你所说的“群众”的意见。
    党和毛主席最爱护劳动力
    邓拓恶毒地诬蔑我们党不懂得“爱护劳动力”，对这些黑话，许多贫下中农也进行了驳斥。城关公社许贡庄生产队贫下中农代表孙玉堂说：邓拓骂我们党还不如封建社会的地主阶级“爱护劳动力”，这不是站在地主阶级立场上为地主说好话吗？在旧社会里，地主就是靠喝穷人的血起家的，他只嫌剥削的少，那能谈得上“爱护劳动力”呢？我是从外地逃荒到许贡庄的，给地主扛长工，一年到头，累死累活，挨打受骂，还不得温暖，这就是个证明！城关公社韩村大队党支部副书记杨素兰说：我们党最懂得爱护劳动力。社员每月出勤天数，都由社员自己讨论决定。每月还有休假日期，妇女生孩子还有产假。社员生活有了困难，党和政府非常关心。前几年遇到严重自然灾害，党和国家从外地运来了大批粮食和物资，吃的、烧的、用的，都为俺打算的周周到到。这能说党对我们不爱护吗？邓拓你这纯粹是诬蔑。
    在各个集会和座谈会上，许多贫下中农都指出，邓拓这一伙疯狂地反党反社会主义，和国内外阶级敌人唱一个调子，都是一个模子里脱出来的坏货。不管你们这伙黑帮耍什么鬼把戏，我们非把你们彻底斗垮不可，不获全胜，决不收兵！
