    Guangdong and Fujian Returned Overseas Chinese Hold Rallies to Angrily Denounce the Heinous Crimes of the Indonesian Reactionaries in Opposing China and Persecuting Chinese
    Chairman Mao and the Powerful Motherland are the Backing of Overseas Chinese
    Warning to the Indonesian Reactionaries: No Good Will Come of Being Hostile to the Chinese People and the Indonesian People
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th) Returned overseas Chinese from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held rallies today to resolutely support the May 18th note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Embassy in China and the statement from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and to angrily condemn the monstrous crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in frantically persecuting overseas Chinese.
    The returned overseas Chinese pointed out that the note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed what thousands upon thousands of overseas Chinese wanted to say, and fully embodied the motherland's concern for the suffering overseas Chinese in Indonesia. They unanimously demanded that the Indonesian government respond satisfactorily to the note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible, immediately stop the atrocities of persecuting overseas Chinese, and ensure that the victimized overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China can return to the motherland smoothly as soon as possible.
    At the rallies held separately by the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, many newly returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia used their own firsthand experiences to accuse the Indonesian right-wing thugs of the fascist acts of looting, beating, and killing overseas Chinese. Among them, some had been illegally arrested by Indonesian right-wing thugs and subjected to severe torture; some were slandered for "illegal activities" and subjected to various persecutions simply because they had portraits of Chairman Mao and books published in Beijing at home. Liu Yaozeng, the newly returned chairman of the Jakarta Chinese Association in Indonesia, revealed at the meeting the anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, saying: "We solemnly warn the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces: although you deliberately sabotage the relations between the two countries, although you have carried out cruel persecution against overseas Chinese, we have Chairman Mao in our hearts and a powerful socialist motherland behind us, and we have full confidence and strength to overcome your anti-China and anti-Chinese countercurrent."
    Many family members of Indonesian victimized overseas Chinese angrily accused the Indonesian right-wing thugs of the crimes of brutally killing their relatives at the meeting. Zhang Qun'ai, a female worker at the Guangdong Glass Factory, angrily accused: "My family lived on Lombok Island, Indonesia. On December 26th last year, Indonesian right-wing thugs suddenly broke into the house, hacked my brother Zhang Zhongxiang to death, and my sister-in-law Zhang Meizhen, who had only been married to my brother for five days, was raped by the thugs and also suffered a tragic death. My second brother-in-law Yu Yaoyi, nephew Yu Guoming, cousin Zhang Quanhou, and nephew Zhang Jinfang were also killed by the thugs one after another." The returned overseas Chinese angrily pointed out that the Indonesian government's anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities are irrefutable evidence and cannot be denied in any way. The overseas Chinese have a strong socialist motherland as their backing, and are led by the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and cannot be slaughtered and bullied at will.
    The persons in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese participated in the meeting today. Yi Meihou, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, expressed on behalf of the returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese throughout the province that they resolutely supported the note and statement issued by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and angrily condemned the Indonesian government's attempt to deny the responsibility for persecuting overseas Chinese. Yi Meihou finally expressed the deepest concern and condolences to the victimized overseas Chinese currently in Indonesia on behalf of the returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese throughout the province, and expressed that they would work hard to do all the preparatory work for receiving overseas Chinese and warmly welcome the suffering overseas Chinese to return home as soon as possible.
    Huang Jie, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, who had lived in Indonesia for decades, cited facts at the meeting to refute the shameless lies of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces that the anti-Chinese atrocities were caused by the "attitude and behavior" of the overseas Chinese. He said: "We warn the Indonesian right-wing generals: your perverse actions will not end well!" Fang Junzhuang, chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the barbaric persecution of Chinese nationals by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces was carefully planned and organized. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces insisted on turning the atrocities of persecuting overseas Chinese into some kind of "reaction of the angry masses," attempting to shift the blame to the Indonesian people, which is the most shameless slander against the Indonesian people. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. Their attempt to cover up the sky with one hand and deny their guilt will never be allowed by the great Chinese people, nor will it be allowed by the people of the world and the Indonesian people.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 20th) Returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City held a rally on the 19th, resolutely supporting the note given by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Embassy in China on May 18th and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and angrily denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against China and persecuting Chinese. They unanimously demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop the atrocities of persecuting overseas Chinese and be responsible for arranging ships to send the overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to China back to China.
    Wang Hanjie, chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said at the meeting on behalf of all returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and returned overseas Chinese students that they resolutely supported the note of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the statement of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. He warned that the powerful motherland would never ignore the barbaric persecution of overseas Chinese by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. If the Indonesian government does not stop the persecution of overseas Chinese, it will surely reap the consequences.
    Jiang Yaying, a relative of overseas Chinese whose younger brother was killed by the Indonesian reactionaries, angrily accused at the meeting: My brother Kang Minghua went out on business on November 13th last year and was beaten to death on the road by Indonesian right-wing thugs. The thugs robbed him of everything on his body and threw his body in the suburbs, leaving behind six old and young people in the family, without any support. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces to the Chinese people must be repaid.
    Guo Ruiren, vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said angrily that the Indonesian government not only brazenly refused to send the overseas Chinese who voluntarily returned to China back to China, but also tried to make things difficult and obstruct our government's dispatch of ships to transport the victimized overseas Chinese, which we will never tolerate.
    Lin Zhuguang, vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese from Malaya, severely condemned the crimes of the Indonesian right-wing generals using Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to persecute overseas Chinese. He said that now the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces openly collude with Chiang Kai-shek's gang in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, acting in collusion, which fully exposes what kind of stuff they are.
    Lin Zhuguang, chairman of the Fuzhou Municipal Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, said that the anti-China and anti-Chinese countercurrent launched by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces is essentially against the Indonesian people and will surely be resolutely opposed by the Indonesian people.
    Li Qingding, Lin Nian, and Shen Yousheng, returned overseas Chinese workers from Indonesia, solemnly warned the Indonesian government in their speeches: The great Chinese people cannot be humiliated, and dark clouds cannot cover the sun. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, who are hostile to the Chinese people and hostile to the Indonesian people, will never end well.

    广东福建归侨集会愤怒声讨印尼反动派反华排华的滔天罪行
    毛主席和强大的祖国是华侨的靠山
    警告印尼反动派：同中国人民为敌，同印度尼西亚人民为敌，不会有好下场
    据新华社广州二十日电广东省、广州市各界归国华侨今天分别集会，坚决拥护我国外交部五月十八日给印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明，愤怒谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂地迫害华侨的滔天罪行。
    归国华侨们指出，我国外交部的照会说出了上千上万华侨心中要说的话，充分体现了祖国对印度尼西亚受难华侨的关怀。他们一致要求印度尼西亚政府对我国外交部的照会尽速作出满意的答复，立即停止迫害华侨的暴行，保证自愿返国的受害华侨能够早日顺利回到祖国。
    在广东省、广州市归国华侨联合会分别举行的集会上，许多新近回国的印度尼西亚归侨用自己眼见身受的事实，控诉印度尼西亚右派暴徒掠夺、殴打、残杀华侨的法西斯行径。他们当中，有的曾被印度尼西亚右派暴徒非法逮捕并受到严刑拷打；有的只是因为家里挂着毛主席的像、存有北京出版的书刊，就被诬蔑为“非法行为”而受到种种迫害。新近回国的印度尼西亚雅加达中华侨团总会主席刘耀曾，在会上揭露了印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华排华的暴行说：“我们正告印度尼西亚右派反动势力：尽管你们蓄意破坏两国关系，尽管你们对华侨进行了残酷的迫害，但是，我们的心里有毛主席，背后有强大的社会主义祖国，完全有信心、有力量战胜你们的反华排华逆流。”
    许多印度尼西亚受害华侨的家属，在会上愤怒地控诉了印度尼西亚右派暴徒惨杀他们亲人的罪行。广东玻璃厂女工张群爱激愤地控诉说：“我一家住在印度尼西亚龙目岛，去年十二月二十六日，印度尼西亚右派暴徒突然冲进屋里，把我哥哥张忠祥一刀砍死，同我哥哥结婚才五天的嫂嫂张美珍，被暴徒奸污后也遭到惨害。二姊丈余耀义、外甥余国铭、堂兄张权厚、侄子张锦芳四人也先后遭到暴徒杀害。”归侨们愤怒地指出：印度尼西亚政府反华排华的暴行铁证如山，是怎么也抵赖不了的。华侨有强大的社会主义祖国作靠山，有伟大的共产党和毛主席领导，不是任意可以宰割、欺侮的。
    广东省、广州市归国华侨联合会的负责人今天参加了集会。广东省侨联主席蚁美厚在会上代表全省归侨、侨眷表示坚决拥护我国外交部、华侨事务委员会为了维护印度尼西亚华侨正当权益而发出的照会和声明，并愤怒地斥责印度尼西亚政府妄图抵赖迫害华侨的罪责。蚁美厚最后还代表全省归侨、侨眷向目前在印度尼西亚的受害侨胞，表示最深切的关怀和慰问，并表示要努力做好一切接侨的准备工作，热烈欢迎受难侨胞早日归来。
    在印度尼西亚侨居了几十年的广东省侨联副主席黄洁，在会上列举事实，驳斥印度尼西亚右派反动势力胡说排华暴行是由于华侨的“态度和行为”引起的无耻谰言。他说：“我们警告印度尼西亚右派将领集团：你们倒行逆施，是不会有什么好下场的！”广州市侨联主席方君壮说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力对我国侨民进行野蛮的迫害，是经过精心策划和组织的。印度尼西亚右派反动势力硬把迫害华侨的暴行，说成是什么“愤怒的人民大众的反应”，妄图把罪责推给印度尼西亚人民，这是对印度尼西亚人民最无耻的诬蔑。血债必须用血来还，他们企图一手遮天，抵赖罪责，伟大的中国人民绝不容许，全世界人民和印度尼西亚人民也是绝不容许的。
    据新华社福州二十日电福建省、福州市的归国华侨和侨眷十九日集会，坚决支持我国外交部在五月十八日给印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆的照会和华侨事务委员会的声明，愤怒斥责印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华排华的法西斯暴行。他们一致要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止迫害华侨的暴行，并负责安排船只，把自愿回国的华侨送回中国。
    福建省归国华侨联合会主席王汉杰在会上代表全省归国华侨、华侨眷属、归国华侨学生，表示坚决拥护我国外交部的照会和侨委的声明。他警告说，强大的祖国对印度尼西亚右派反动势力野蛮迫害侨胞，决不会置之不顾。印度尼西亚政府如果不停止对华侨的迫害，必将自食其果。
    亲弟弟被印度尼西亚反动派杀害的侨眷江雅英在会上愤怒地控诉说：我的弟弟康明华在去年十一月十三日因事出门，在路上被印度尼西亚右派暴徒活活打死，暴徒们把他身上所有的东西抢光后，又把尸首丢在郊外，现在家中丢下老少六口，无依无靠。印度尼西亚右派反动势力欠下中国人民的血债是一定要偿还的。
    福建省归国华侨联合会副主席、印度尼西亚归国华侨郭瑞人愤怒地说，印度尼西亚政府不仅悍然拒绝把自愿回国的华侨送回中国，而且对我国政府派船前往接运受害华侨妄图进行刁难和阻挠，这是我们绝不能容忍的。
    福建省归国华侨联合会副主席、马来亚归国华侨林珠光在发言中，严厉谴责印度尼西亚右派将领集团利用蒋匪帮特务残害华侨的罪行。他说，现在印度尼西亚右派反动势力在反华排华中公然同蒋匪帮勾结，狼狈为奸，这就充分暴露了他们究竟是什么货色。
    福州市归国华侨联合会主席、印度尼西亚归侨林珠光说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力掀起的反华排华逆流，实质上是反对印度尼西亚人民，一定会遭到印度尼西亚人民的坚决反对。
    从印度尼西亚回国的华侨职工李庆丁、林年、沈幼生在发言中正告印度尼西亚政府：伟大的中国人民是不可辱的，乌云遮不住太阳。印尼右派反动势力同中国人民为敌，同印度尼西亚人民为敌，决不会有好下场。
