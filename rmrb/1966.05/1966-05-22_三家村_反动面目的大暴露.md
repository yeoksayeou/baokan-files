    The Great Exposure of the Reactionary Face of "Sanjiacun"
    Lu Tianming
    After reading Comrade Liu Chengjie's article, "‘Qianxian’—A Tool for Capitalist Restoration," I further saw the grand conspiracy of the "Sanjiacun" black shop. This is truly a startling piece of material. Another layer of the "Sanjiacun" black curtain has been unveiled.
    It seems that the small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements in "Sanjiacun" are quite experienced in counter-revolution and understand counter-revolutionary tactics quite well. They know how to seize the "key" and grasp the "vital point." In the words of Deng Tuo, the boss of "Sanjiacun," they believed that the "very important" "big issues" were "positions," "teams," and "artillery shells."
    What were their "positions"?
    "Qianxian," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" were their "positions." Publishing books and editing the "Historical Small Series" were their "positions." The stage for performing bad plays was also their "position." They believed that these were only "openings." They also wanted to expand their "positions" and occupy more "positions." In a word, they wanted to occupy all the "positions" in the ideological sphere. The reason they were able to occupy and expand their "positions" in this sphere was because they had usurped leadership positions in some departments of the Party and government.
    Fortresses are most easily breached from within. These insidious representatives of the bourgeoisie did their utmost to infiltrate our ranks, seize positions, especially positions in the ideological sphere, engage in the superstructure, and engage in theoretical, academic, literary, and other spiritual things, in order to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism and pave the way for the subversion of the proletarian regime.
    What were their "teams"?
    Bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the Party, traitors to the Communist Party, escaped Rightists, and long-time anti-Communists, such as Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han, were the backbone of the "Sanjiacun" anti-Party clique. They collected "all sorts" of people, including reactionary landlord and bourgeois elements, as well as anti-Party, anti-socialist "scholars," "authorities," "masters," "famous people," and even traitors, etc. They also wanted to win over more people and corrupt more people. When explaining their policy of recruiting troops, Deng Tuo said, "We must be like rolling a snowball, the more we associate, the wider and bigger it becomes, and constantly discover talents in various units."
    What were their "artillery shells"?
    Their "artillery shells" were anti-Party, anti-socialist "artillery shells," "artillery shells" that spread the poison of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism. The various things they threw out, as Deng Tuo said, "every word is an artillery shell," "everything is said, not a word is empty," "the whole is permeated with political vision," and "every shot hits the target." They talked about history, fables, medicine, wrote scripts, told lies, etc., all to be "aimed at the current situation," all to be "to the point," all to "talk about the vital point and put forward some substantial conclusions." Every shell they fired was aimed at the "vital point," opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the Party Central Committee, and opposing the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system.
    What was the ultimate goal of the "Sanjiacun" anti-Party clique in occupying "positions," organizing "teams," and firing "artillery shells"? Listen to Deng Tuo's blatant confession: "In every turning period, in every period of transition from the old to the new, revisionism will come out. Every time a Marxist dies, there will be his closest people—friends, old acquaintances—who will come out to revise it." This clearly means that they want to implement thorough revisionism, and once the time is ripe, they will usurp the leadership of the Party and the state and turn the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship.
    The characteristic of the "Sanjiacun" anti-revolutionary gang is that they oppose the Red Flag while waving the "Red Flag," oppose the Communist Party while sitting in the leading organs of the Communist Party, and oppose the Communist Party while using the banner of Communist Party newspapers and periodicals, attempting to "cut cleanly and neatly with one stroke" and "leave no trace." This is their insidious and vicious nature, and this is where their harm is greatest.
    The rampant activities of the "Sanjiacun" anti-Party clique tell us that the enemy is sleeping beside us, stirring up trouble within our ranks. However, since they are engaged in anti-Party, anti-socialist activities, no matter how disguised they are, it is impossible to "leave no trace." As long as the revolutionary people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and improve their political sensitivity, they will certainly be able to distinguish between truth and falsehood, identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and drag out all the monsters and demons.
    The "Sanjiacun" anti-Party clique, like all backward, decadent, and reactionary factions, always makes erroneous estimates of the situation of class struggle. Deng Tuo once predicted: "For the sake of the cause," "truly devote oneself to it," not afraid of "banging one's head until it bleeds," "the future is limitless." They did indeed "devote themselves to it," and they did indeed have the anti-revolutionary die-hard spirit of not being afraid of "banging their heads until they bled." However, "How easy is it to shake a tree with an ant," in the current high tide of the socialist Cultural Revolution, the "Sanjiacun" anti-Party, anti-people, anti-socialist clique has been exposed. Where else can this small handful of counter-revolutionary elements and their backstage supporters escape! We must thoroughly destroy the nest of this poisonous snake, "Sanjiacun," and never stop until we win complete victory!

    “三家村”反动面目的大暴露
    鲁天明
    我读了刘成杰同志写的《〈前线〉——资本主义复辟的工具》的文章，进一步使我看到了“三家村”黑店的大阴谋。这真是一篇使人触目惊心的材料。“三家村”的黑幕又被揭开了一层。
    看来“三家村”的一小撮反党反社会主义分子，是颇有反革命经验，颇懂得反革命策略的。他们知道抓住“关键”，抓住“要害”。用“三家村”掌柜邓拓的话来说，他们认为“很重要”的“大问题”，就是“阵地”、“队伍”和“炮弹”。
    什么是他们的“阵地”呢？
    《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》，是他们的“阵地”。出版书籍，主编“历史小丛书”，是他们的“阵地”。演坏戏的舞台，也是他们的“阵地”。这些，他们认为仅仅是“开了端”。他们还要扩大“阵地”，还要占领更多的“阵地”。一句话，他们就是要占领意识形态领域的一切“阵地”。他们所以能够在这个领域内占领和扩大“阵地”，是因为他们窃据了党和政府一些部门的领导岗位。
    堡垒是最容易从内部被攻破的。这些阴险的资产阶级代表人物，就竭力混进我们的队伍里来，夺取阵地，特别是夺取意识形态领域内的阵地，搞上层建筑，搞理论、学术、文艺等等精神方面的东西，来为复辟资本主义准备舆论条件，为颠覆无产阶级政权开辟道路。
    什么是他们的“队伍”呢？
    混入党内的资产阶级代表人物，共产党的叛徒，漏网的右派，长期反共的老手，象邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗这样的人，是“三家村”反党集团的骨干。他们搜罗了“杂七杂八”的人，包括反动的地主资产阶级分子以及反党反社会主义的“学者”、“权威”、
  “大师”、“著名人士”，甚至汉奸等等。他们还要拉拢更多的人，腐蚀更多的人。邓拓在说明他们招兵买马的方针时说，“要如滚雪球一样，越交越广，越滚越大，在各单位不断地发现人材”。
    什么是他们的“炮弹”呢？
    他们的“炮弹”，就是反党反社会主义的“炮弹”，就是散布资本主义、封建主义、修正主义毒素的“炮弹”。他们抛出来的各种各样的东西，象邓拓所说的，“字字是炮弹”，“什么都讲，一字不空”，“整个的都是政治眼光贯串着”，“弹不虚发”。他们讲历史，谈寓言，传医道，编剧本，扯谎话，等等，都是要“针对当前的”，都是要“一针见血”，都是要“讲要害，提出些有分量的结论”。他们发出的每一发炮弹，都是射向“要害”，反对毛泽东思想，反对党中央，反对无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。
    “三家村”反党集团占领“阵地”、组织“队伍”、连发“炮弹”，他们的最终目的是什么呢？请听邓拓的一段露骨的自白：“每个转折时期、新旧交替的时期，修正主义就会出来。每个马克思主义者死了，都有他最亲近的人——朋友，老交情，出来修正它”。这明明是说，他们要实行彻头彻尾的修正主义，一旦时机成熟，他们就要篡夺党和国家的领导，把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政。
    “三家村”一伙反革命的特点是，打着“红旗”反红旗，坐在共产党的领导机关里反共产党，打着共产党报刊的招牌反共产党，企图“干净利落地一刀下去”、“不留痕迹”。这就是他们阴险、毒辣的地方，就是他们危害最大的地方。
    “三家村”反党集团的猖狂活动告诉我们，敌人正睡在我们的身边，隐藏在我们内部兴风作浪。但是，他们既要搞反党反社会主义的活动，那么无论怎样伪装，都决不可能“不留痕迹”。只要革命的人民用毛泽东思想武装起来，提高政治上的敏感，就一定能辨别真伪，鉴别香花和毒草，把一切牛鬼蛇神通通揪出来。
    “三家村”反党集团，象所有落后的腐朽的反动派一样，总是对阶级斗争的形势作出错误的估计。邓拓就曾经这样预言：“为了事业”，“真正死心塌地地钻进去”，不怕“碰得头破血流”，“前途不可限量”。他们确实是“死心塌地地钻进去”了，确实是抱着不怕“头破血流”的反革命死硬派精神。但是，“蚍蜉撼树谈何易”，在目前社会主义文化大革命的高潮中，“三家村”反党反人民反社会主义集团已经被揭露出来了。他们这一小撮反革命分子和他们的后台还能往哪里逃！我们一定要彻底捣毁“三家村”这个毒蛇的巢穴，不获全胜，决不收兵！
