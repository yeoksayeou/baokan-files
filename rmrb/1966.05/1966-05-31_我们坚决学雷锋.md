    We Resolutely Learn from Lei Feng
    Wang Honghai and Zhou Guangjun, Young Pioneers of Benxi Road Primary School, Fushun City

    Deng Tuo, Wu Han! You gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, you dug up a pile of dead men's bones, nonsense that Hai Rui and others were "heroes," openly advocating that anti-Party elements continue to attack the Party and the people. As if that wasn’t enough, you even told us to learn from these dead men. Bah! They served the emperor and landlords, what kind of heroes are they? Only emperors and landlords would call them "heroes." What the enemy says is good, we must resolutely oppose. Our instructor, Uncle Lei Feng, said: "Landlord Zhang San is a living閻王 [Yan Wang; King of Hell], Landlord Li Si is a smiling tiger. You can never say Landlord Zhang San is bad, and Landlord Li Si is better. All crows under heaven are equally black." A dog eats excrement, there is no good person in the pile of bureaucrats and landlords.
    Whenever we mention landlords, our hatred is endless. Uncle Lei Feng told us the story of "Nine Years of Blood and Tears" and showed us the scars on his hands. The damned landlords almost tortured Uncle Lei Feng to death. If the Party and Chairman Mao had not liberated all of China, we would never have known Uncle Lei Feng, how could we have such a good instructor? Landlords are all black-hearted, they have no "benevolence" at all. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, you want us to learn from the landlord class’s Hai Rui, what kind of medicine are you selling in your black gourd? The truth is now clear. You want to deceive us and follow you in opposing the Party and socialism, this is wishful thinking.
    Deng Tuo, Wu Han! Your sinister plan has failed, we are Young Pioneers educated by Chairman Mao, we are revolutionary successors. In our minds, the revolutionary heroes are engraved. Chairman Mao calls on us to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." We resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and do as Chairman Mao says. The great communist fighter, our most beloved instructor—Uncle Lei Feng, is our best example to learn from. He loves and hates clearly, is utterly selfless, and dedicated to serving others. Learning from him, we understand that "to comrades, be as warm as spring"; learning from him, we understand that "to enemies, be as cruel and ruthless as winter"; learning from him, from a young age, we follow the worker-peasant-soldier uncles to learn fighting, learn construction, and make revolution; learning from him, we all resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and be good children of Chairman Mao. And also Jiao Yulu, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Zhao Xiaoshou, Zhang Chunyu… They, like Uncle Lei Feng, are great revolutionary heroes. They are truly the role models for our Young Pioneers to learn from.
    Deng Tuo, Wu Han! Listen to this, the Red Scarves [Young Pioneers] who were instructed by our Uncle Lei Feng solemnly warn you: your dreams are over, the children of the new China resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, overthrow all anti-Party and anti-socialist monsters and demons, learn from the example of revolutionary heroes, take the revolutionary road, and be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    我们坚决学雷锋
    抚顺市本溪路小学少先队员　汪洪海　周广君
    邓拓，吴晗！你们这伙反党反社会主义分子，抱出一堆死人骨头，胡说海瑞等是“英雄”，公开鼓吹反党分子继续向党和人民进攻。这不算，还叫我们也向这些死人学习。呸！他们替皇帝地主卖命，算得上那份英雄。只有皇帝、地主才称他们
  “英雄”。敌人说好的，我们就要坚决反对。我们的辅导员雷锋叔叔说过：“张三地主是活阎王，李四地主是笑面虎，这决不能说张三地主不好，李四地主好些。天下乌鸦一般黑。”是狗就吃屎，官僚地主堆里没好人。
    一提起地主，我们的仇恨就说不完。雷锋叔叔给我们讲过“血泪九年”的故事，还给我们看过他手上的伤疤，万恶的地主差点没把雷锋叔叔折磨死。要不是党和毛主席解放了全中国，我们根本不会认识雷锋叔叔，那会有这样好的辅导员？地主都是黑心肠，那有一点“仁慈”。邓拓、吴晗，你们让我们向地主阶级的海瑞学习，你们黑葫芦里装的什么药？现在已经真相大白了。你们就是要欺骗我们，跟你们反党反社会主义，这是妄想。
    邓拓，吴晗！你们的鬼算盘打错了，我们是毛主席教导下的少先队员，是革命接班人。在我们的心目中，刻下的是革命英雄谱。毛主席号召我们“向雷锋同志学习”。我们坚决听毛主席的话，照着毛主席的话去做。伟大的共产主义战士，我们最敬爱的辅导员——雷锋叔叔，是我们最好的学习榜样。他爱憎分明，毫不利己，专门利人。学习他，我们懂得了“对同志要象春天般温暖”；学习他，我们懂得了“对敌人要象严冬一样残酷无情”；学习他，我们从小就跟着工农兵叔叔学打仗，学建设，干革命；学习他，我们都坚决听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好孩子。还有焦裕禄、王杰、麦贤得、赵小寿、张春玉……他们和雷锋叔叔一样，都是伟大的革命英雄。他们才真正是我们少先队员学习的榜样。
    邓拓，吴晗！你们听着，我们雷锋叔叔辅导过的红领巾正告你：你们的梦想完蛋了，新中国的少年儿童坚决听毛主席的话，打倒一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神，学习革命英雄的榜样，走革命的道路，做无产阶级革命事业接班人。
