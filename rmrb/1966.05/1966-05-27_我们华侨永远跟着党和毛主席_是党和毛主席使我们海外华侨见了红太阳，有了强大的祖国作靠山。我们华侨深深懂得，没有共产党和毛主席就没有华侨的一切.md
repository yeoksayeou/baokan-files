    We Overseas Chinese Will Forever Follow the Party and Chairman Mao
    It was the Party and Chairman Mao who allowed us overseas Chinese to see the red sun and have a strong motherland as our backing. We overseas Chinese deeply understand that without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, overseas Chinese would have nothing.

    We are returned overseas Chinese, and we are extremely angry at the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo and others. Although we are not very good at writing articles, and Chen Rongqiao is still recuperating, we cannot help but pick up our pens and join this life-and-death struggle, resolutely smash the anti-revolutionary black gang of Deng Tuo and eliminate this anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and resolutely defend socialism. We will never allow this group of enemies without guns to touch a single hair of our Party, and we will never allow them to slander our beloved great leader! We must subdue this group of enemies, so that they can no longer stir up trouble.

    Before the liberation of the motherland, overseas Chinese were "overseas orphans" who were bullied, slaughtered, and trampled underfoot by others. The Party and Chairman Mao led the people to liberate the motherland, and in just over a decade, they built the motherland into such a powerful country, allowing overseas Chinese to see the red sun from then on! From then on, we had a mother, and such a strong motherland as our backing, and we would never be "overseas orphans" again! Overseas, overseas Chinese can hold their heads high, stick out their chests, and walk on the streets with firm and powerful steps, with the pride of being Chinese! We overseas Chinese deeply understand that without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no New China, and overseas Chinese would have nothing! The hearts of returned overseas Chinese and the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese thousands of miles away, under the Party's cordial care and education, are forever towards the Party and Chairman Mao! We infinitely love our great, wise, and correct Party and our most beloved Chairman Mao! We will forever follow the Party and Chairman Mao to the end! Deng Tuo, let me tell you, we absolutely will not allow you anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to touch a single hair of the Party, and any vicious slander and attacks you make against the Party will not shake our infinitely loving heart for the Party and Chairman Mao, but will only arouse our more profound hatred for you enemies without guns and a hundred times more love for the Party and Chairman Mao!

    Deng Tuo, let me tell you, any vicious conspiracy of you anti-Party and anti-socialist elements will never succeed, and you will only be "lifting a stone to drop it on your own feet." It is you who are "bashing your heads until they are bleeding" in the face of the facts! You "social scum" will be thrown into the "garbage can" by the people!

    Here we want to especially question the editorial departments of *Qianxian* [*Frontline*], *Beijing Ribao* [*Beijing Daily*], and *Beijing Wanbao* [*Beijing Evening News*]. In recent years, you have released so many poisonous arrows for this group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo, acting as accomplices to this small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo. Now, you have not only failed to conduct a serious and thorough exposure and criticism of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes and your own serious mistakes, but you have also played tricks and used poisonous schemes in an attempt to cover up Deng Tuo, the head of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, and the murderer who wantonly spread poison, so that he can escape. Let us tell you that this is absolutely impossible! We want to ask you, in this life-and-death class struggle, where exactly do you want to go? The people will definitely settle accounts with you for your crimes of acting as accomplices to this group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo, and you must thoroughly confess to the people!

    The overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought are determined to thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" black shop together with the people of the whole country and overthrow these enemies without guns who are mixed in the revolutionary ranks. We will never stop until we win a complete victory.

    我们华侨永远跟着党和毛主席
    是党和毛主席使我们海外华侨见了红太阳，有了强大的祖国作靠山。我们华侨深深懂得，没有共产党和毛主席就没有华侨的一切
    印度尼西亚归国华侨　陈荣侨　新加坡归国华侨　刘韵芳
    我们是归国华侨，对邓拓等人反党反社会主义的罪行，十分气愤。我们尽管不大会写文章，而且陈荣侨还正在养病，但是，也禁不住要拿起笔来投入这场你死我活的斗争，坚决打垮邓拓这伙反革命黑帮，搞掉这根反党反社会主义的黑线，坚决保卫社会主义。决不容许这伙不拿枪的敌人动我们党一根毫毛，决不容许污蔑我们敬爱的伟大领袖！一定要制服邓拓这伙敌人，使他们再也不能兴妖作怪。
    在祖国解放前，华侨是任人欺辱、任人宰割、被人踩在脚底下的“海外孤儿”。党和毛主席领导人民解放了祖国，在短短的十几年中把祖国建设成为如此强大的国家，使海外华侨从此见到了红太阳！从此有了娘，有了如此强大的祖国作靠山，永远不再成为“海外孤儿”了！在海外，华侨能够昂起头，挺起胸，迈着坚定有力的步伐，怀着做一个中国人的自豪感走在街上了！我们华侨深深懂得没有共产党和毛主席就没有新中国，就没有华侨的一切！我们在党亲切关怀和教育下的归国华侨和远在万里之外的广大爱国华侨的心，是永远向着党和毛主席的！我们无比热爱我们伟大、英明、正确的党和最敬爱的毛主席！我们永远跟党和毛主席走到底！邓拓，告诉你，我们绝对不容许你们这伙反党反社会主义分子动党的一根毫毛，你们对党的任何恶毒污蔑和攻击，丝毫动摇不了我们无比热爱党和毛主席的心，而只能激起我们对你们这些不拿枪的敌人更加刻骨仇恨，更加百倍地热爱党和毛主席！
    邓拓，告诉你，你们这伙反党反社会主义分子的任何恶毒阴谋，决不会得逞，只能是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”。在事实面前“碰得头破血流”的正是你们！你们这些“社会渣滓”，将被人民扔到“垃圾箱”里去！
    在这里我们要特别责问《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》的编辑部。近几年来，你们为邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子放出这么多的毒箭，充当了邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的帮凶。如今，你们对邓拓的反党反社会主义的罪行和自己的严重错误，不仅没有进行认真严肃的揭露和批判，反而耍花招、施展毒计，企图掩护邓拓这个“三家村”黑店的头目、大肆放毒的凶手逃走。告诉你们，这是绝对办不到的！我们要责问你们，在这场你死我活的阶级斗争中，你们到底想要往哪里走？你们充当邓拓这伙反党反社会主义帮凶的罪行，人民一定要向你们清算的，你们必须彻底向人民交代！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的华侨，坚决和全国人民一道，彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店，打倒这些混在革命队伍里的不拿枪的敌人。不获全胜，决不收兵。
