    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th – The Albanian Party and Government Delegation, led by Comrade Shehu, today visited the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, the famous Daqing-style enterprise, Yongxin Seamless Steel Pipe Factory, and the Shanghai Children’s Palace. Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kambo, and others received the warmest welcome from the people.
    Comrades Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Wu Xiuquan, Wei Wenbo, Cao Diqiu and others accompanied the distinguished guests on their visit.
    At the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kambo, and others viewed many advanced and precision products, such as high-precision semi-automatic universal cylindrical grinders, vacuum electron bombardment furnaces, 200,000-magnification first-grade large electron microscopes, 6,000-kilowatt gas turbines, and optical coordinate boring machines. Comrade Shehu visited China in 1959 and had visited the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition. Today, during the visit, he said happily: “When I visited in 1959, I had not seen such machines.” Comrade Cao Diqiu told the distinguished guests that Shanghai now produces nearly 100,000 kinds of products. The workers are working hard to catch up with the advanced international scientific and technological level, which is an important task undertaken by Shanghai.
    During the visit to the Yongxin Seamless Steel Pipe Factory, Comrade Shehu and Comrade Deng Xiaoping watched various special-shaped seamless steel pipes with great interest. At the end of the visit, Zhao Xixiang, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, presented some samples of special-shaped steel pipes to the guests on behalf of all the factory’s employees. Comrade Shehu also presented the factory with a banner and a photo album reflecting the achievements of Albania's socialist construction.
    Prior to this, Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kambo, and others visited the Shanghai Children’s Palace and were warmly welcomed by the Young Pioneers. The Young Pioneers blew their bugles, beat their drums, and waved bouquets and willow branches, enthusiastically shouting: "Welcome, welcome! Uncle Shehu!" When the distinguished guests came to the activity room of the painting group and saw the plaster statue of Comrade Lei Feng, Comrade Kambo encouraged the children and said: "When you grow up, you must also be Lei Feng." A Young Pioneer replied: "We will certainly listen to you and learn from Uncle Lei Feng." Comrade Kambo shook a Young Pioneer’s hand happily and said: "I hope you listen to Chairman Mao well and be good children of Chairman Mao."
    The distinguished guests were about to leave. The Young Pioneers shouted "Goodbye! Goodbye! Uncle Shehu!" reluctantly and asked Comrade Shehu to send greetings to the Albanian children.

    由周恩来邓小平等同志陪同
    谢胡卡博等同志在上海参观受到最热烈欢迎
    新华社上海六日电　由谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团，今天上午在上海参观了上海工业展览会，访问了著名的大庆式企业——永鑫无缝钢管厂，以及上海市少年宫。谢胡同志、卡博同志等受到了人们最热烈的欢迎。
    周恩来、邓小平、伍修权、魏文伯、曹荻秋等同志，陪同贵宾参观访问。
    谢胡同志、卡博同志等在上海工业展览会，参观了高精度半自动万能外圆磨床、真空电子轰击炉、二十万倍一级大型电子显微镜、六千瓩燃气轮机、光学座标镗床等许多高级、精密产品。谢胡同志一九五九年访问过中国，曾经参观过上海工业展览会。今天，他在参观时高兴地说：“一九五九年我来参观的时候，还没有看到这样的机器。”曹荻秋同志告诉贵宾们，现在上海生产的产品近十万种。工人们正在努力赶超国际先进的科学技术水平，这是上海担负的一项重要的任务。
    在永鑫无缝钢管厂访问时，谢胡同志和邓小平同志很有兴趣地看了各种异型无缝钢管。访问结束时，工厂党支部书记赵熙祥，代表全厂职工把一部分异型钢管样品送给客人。谢胡同志也向工厂赠送了锦旗和反映阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设成就的相册。
    在此以前，谢胡同志、卡博同志等访问了上海市少年宫，受到了少先队员的热烈欢迎。少先队员们吹起号角，擂起队鼓，挥舞着花束、柳条，热情奔放地高呼：“欢迎、欢迎！谢胡伯伯！”贵宾们来到绘画小组的活动室，看到雷锋同志石膏象，卡博同志勉励孩子们说：“你们长大了也要做雷锋。”一个少先队员回答说：“我们一定听您的话，向雷锋叔叔学习。”卡博同志握着一个少先队员的手高兴地说：“希望你们好好听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好孩子。”
    贵宾要离开了。少先队员们依依不舍地高呼“再见！再见！谢胡伯伯！”并请谢胡同志向阿尔巴尼亚小朋友问好。
