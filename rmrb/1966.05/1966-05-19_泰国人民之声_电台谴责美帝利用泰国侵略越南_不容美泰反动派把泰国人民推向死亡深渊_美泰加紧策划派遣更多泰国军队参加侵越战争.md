    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Bangkok News: "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station broadcast a commentary on the 14th, calling on the patriotic people of Thailand to unite closely and carry out resolute struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dog Thanom-Praphas group to further transform Thailand into a base for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and a rest and recuperation area for U.S. troops invading Vietnam.

    The commentary said that the number of U.S. invading troops stationed in Thailand has increased from 5,000 in May 1962 to more than 20,000, and there are reports that it will soon increase to 30,000. U.S. air bases in Thailand have also rapidly increased, and a giant military base has been built in Sattahip. Currently, an average of 5,000 U.S. invading troops "on vacation" come to Thailand for rest and recuperation every week. U.S. invading troops can enter Thailand at will. The United States has turned Thailand into a battlefield and more closely linked the Thai battlefield with the South Vietnamese battlefield.

    The commentary pointed out that facts clearly show that in the U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression against Indochina, Thailand is the first to suffer from U.S. aggression. In order to build military bases and strategic highways, the United States has driven hundreds of thousands of Thai farmers from their homes. U.S. planes often randomly drop bombs and rockets in Thailand, causing serious damage to people's lives and property. Large numbers of U.S. troops pouring into Thailand act like overlords, running rampant everywhere and arbitrarily bullying the Thai people. The United States also seizes large quantities of rice from Thailand and transports it to South Vietnam and Laos to feed its invading troops, causing a serious shortage of rice in Thailand and severely impacting the people's lives.

    The commentary said that U.S. imperialism directs its running dog Thanom-Praphas group to intensify the suppression of the patriotic struggles of the Thai people. U.S. Air Force shock troops stationed at the Udon Thani base personally participate directly in the actions to suppress the Thai people. Thai Deputy Minister of Defense Thawi Chullasap said that the suppression of the people in the Northeast "completely depends on the situation in South Vietnam and Laos." It is revealed that the national budget expenditure for 1967 will reach more than 16 billion baht. This is the highest budget expenditure figure in Thai history. In this way, the Thai economy will further collapse, and the people will be subjected to more brutal exploitation.

    The commentary said that the Thai people must not sit idly by while U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas group push the Thai people into the abyss of death. Under the leadership of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, the Thai people, together with the people of the world, will continue to carry out resolute struggles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    The commentary emphasized that the united people are much stronger than U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and they will definitely be able to defeat them in the end.

    Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Bangkok News: The Thai Thanom puppet group dispatched six naval officers to Saigon on the 16th to make arrangements for Thai naval vessels to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    According to earlier reports, the combat troops that the Thanom group decided to send to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam include: a tank landing ship and a coastal patrol boat, totaling 189 officers and soldiers, and two transport planes driven by Thai pilots.

    According to Western news agencies quoting a Thai newspaper report, U.S. imperialism is planning to transfer more Thai troops to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder in the war of aggression. The news said that Thai Prime Minister Thanom will discuss the issue of sending a battalion of combat troops to South Vietnam at a cabinet meeting.

    “泰国人民之声”电台谴责美帝利用泰国侵略越南
    不容美泰反动派把泰国人民推向死亡深渊
    美泰加紧策划派遣更多泰国军队参加侵越战争
    新华社十八日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十四日发表评论，号召泰国爱国人民紧密团结起来，进行坚决斗争，反对美帝国主义和它的走狗他侬—巴博集团进一步把泰国变为扩大侵越战争的基地和侵越美军的休整地。
    评论说，目前进驻泰国的美国侵略军人数已经从一九六二年五月的五千人增加到两万多人，有消息说，在最近将增加到三万人。美国在泰国的空军基地也迅速增加，在梭桃邑修建了一个巨型的军事基地。目前以“度假”为名到泰国进行休整的美国侵略军每周平均有五千人。美国侵略军可以随意进入泰国，美国已把泰国变成一个战场，并把泰国战场同南越战场更加密切地联接起来。
    评论指出，事实清楚地表明，在美帝国主义扩大侵略印度支那的战争中，首先受到美国侵略的是泰国。美国为了修筑军事基地和战略公路，已把数以十万计的泰国农民赶出家园。美国的飞机经常在泰国乱扔炸弹和火箭，给人民的生命财产带来严重的损失。涌进泰国的大量美军以太上皇自居，到处横行霸道，任意欺凌泰国人民。美国还从泰国夺走大量的大米运往南越和老挝，以豢养它的侵略军队，造成泰国大米严重缺乏，人民生活也受到严重的影响。
    评论说，美帝国主义指使它的走狗他侬—巴博集团加紧镇压泰国爱国人民的爱国斗争。美国驻乌隆基地的空军突击队亲自出马直接参加镇压泰国人民的行动。泰国国防部副部长他威·尊拉塞曾宣称，对东北部人民的镇压“完全取决于南越和老挝的局势”。据透露，一九六七年度的国家预算支出将达到一百六十多亿铢。这是泰国历史上的最高预算支出数字。这样，泰国经济也将进一步崩溃，人民将受到更残酷的压榨。
    评论说，泰国人民决不能坐视美帝国主义和他侬—巴博集团把泰国人民推向死亡的深渊。泰国人民在泰国爱国阵线的领导下，和全世界人民一起，将继续同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争。
    评论强调指出，团结起来的人民比美帝国主义及其走狗要强大得多，最后一定能够战胜它们。
    新华社十八日讯　曼谷消息：泰国他侬傀儡集团十六日派遣了六名海军军官到西贡去，为泰国海军舰艇参加侵越战争进行安排。
    据早些时候的报道，他侬集团决定派出参加侵越战争的战斗部队包括：共拥有官兵一百八十九人的一艘坦克登陆艇和一艘海岸巡逻艇，以及两架由泰国驾驶员驾驶的运输机。
    据西方通讯社援引一家泰国报纸报道，美帝国主义正在策划抽调更多的泰国军队到南越去充当侵略战争的炮灰。消息说，泰国总理他侬将要在内阁会议上讨论派遣一营战斗部队到南越去的问题。
