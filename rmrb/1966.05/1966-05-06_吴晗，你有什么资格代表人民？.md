    Wu Han, What Qualifications Do You Have to Represent the People?
    Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory Worker Inspector Sun Yusheng
    In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, supported by American imperialism, launched a full-scale civil war. Wu Han, posing as a "representative of the people," nonsensically claimed that "although the opponents in the civil war are only the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the land resources, manpower, and financial resources belong to all the people. When the two parties fight, they unilaterally talk amongst themselves and completely ignore the people, disregarding matters concerning the very life and death of the people and not allowing the people to have a say or even inquire." Wu Han's words, under the guise of a "third party," were a minor criticism of Chiang Kai-shek but a major assistance, opposing the People's Liberation War and attempting to save the dying Chiang dynasty.
    Recalling the Kuomintang-controlled areas in 1946, the people were truly living in misery. At that time, American soldiers were stationed in Tangshan, and their cars recklessly roamed the streets, committing all kinds of evil deeds; they were simply a pack of beasts. The Kuomintang army was even more extortionate towards the common people. They also conscripted able-bodied men everywhere, insisting that the old were young and the underage were of age. The Kuomintang bandit troops stationed at the Dawangzhuang blockhouse frequently fired their guns, injuring one worker and killing a washing woman. At that time, we working people had no status; to whom could we appeal?
    My hometown, Xinzhuangzi, was near the liberated areas. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) treated the common people kindly and often explained revolutionary principles to them. Whenever they arrived at the homes of the common people, they would fetch water and clean the courtyard. They would refuse cigarettes offered by the people, not taking even a needle or thread from the masses. Truly, the military and the people cooperated like one family. At that time, the workers in our factory eagerly hoped that the Communist Party and the PLA would come to Tangshan soon to liberate us.
    The PLA grew stronger and stronger, and the Kuomintang army suffered repeated defeats. It was clear that the Chiang dynasty was about to collapse. It was at that moment that Wu Han came out posing as a "representative of the people," spreading poison, equating the revolutionary and just people's war waged by the Communist Party with the counter-revolutionary war waged by the Kuomintang. This was to paralyze the masses, urging us working people to lay down our weapons and surrender to Chiang Kai-shek. Of course, Wu Han's sinister schemes could not succeed. We working people could clearly see who was right and who was wrong based on our own experiences. The Communist Party served us working people wholeheartedly, while the Kuomintang oppressed and exploited us. In 1949, we, the broad masses of working people, finally overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and liberated all of China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Wu Han, what qualifications do you have to represent the people? What kind of people do you represent?
    After liberation, Wu Han's reactionary political ambitions did not die. He published his reactionary articles written before liberation, continuing to spread poison in a vain attempt to restore capitalism. Let me tell you frankly, we working people have discerning eyes. You could not deceive us in the past, and you cannot deceive us now. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, fight you to the end, and never stop until we achieve complete victory.

### 吴晗，你有什么资格代表人民？

    吴晗，你有什么资格代表人民？
    唐山机车车辆修理厂工人检查员  孙玉升
    一九四六年，蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下，发动了全面内战。吴晗以“人民代表”自居，胡说什么“内战的对手虽然只是国共双方，可是土地资源人力财力却是全体人民的，两党打仗，两党一相情愿自己谈而完全漠视人民，有关人民本身生死存亡的大事而不容许人民作主，甚至过问。”吴晗说这话，是打着“第三者”的幌子，对蒋介石小骂大帮忙，反对人民解放战争，企图挽救垂死的蒋家皇朝。
    回想起一九四六年的国民党统治区，真是民不聊生。那时美国兵驻在唐山，汽车横冲直撞，无恶不作，简直是一群野兽。国民党军队对老百姓，更是敲诈勒索。他们还到处抓壮丁，岁数大的硬说成小的，岁数不够的硬说成够的。驻在大王庄炮楼的国民党匪军经常往外打枪，有一个工人被打伤，有一个洗衣服的妇女被打死。那时候，我们劳动人民没有地位，向谁说理去？
    我老家新庄子，靠近解放区。解放军对老百姓态度和蔼，经常给大家讲革命道理。他们一到老百姓家，就挑水打扫院子。老百姓给烟抽，他们也不要，他们不拿群众一针一线。真是军民合作，亲如一家。当时我们厂里的工人，日夜盼望共产党、解放军早日来到唐山解放我们。
    解放军越打越强，国民党军队连连吃败仗，眼看蒋家皇朝就要完蛋。就在那个时候，吴晗出来冒充“人民代表”，散布毒素，把共产党进行的革命的、正义的人民战争，同国民党进行的反革命战争说成是一样的。这是为了麻痹人民群众，要我们劳动人民放下武器，向蒋介石投降。当然，吴晗的阴谋诡计是不能得逞的，我们劳动人民根据亲身的体会，谁是谁非，看得都很清楚。共产党是全心全意为我们劳动人民服务的，国民党是压迫和剥削我们劳动人民的。一九四九年我们广大劳动人民终于在中国共产党的领导下，推翻了国民党的反动统治，解放了全中国。吴晗你有什么资格代表人民？你代表的是什么人民？
    解放后，吴晗反动的政治野心并没有死，出版了他解放前写的反动文章继续放毒，妄图复辟资本主义。老实告诉你，我们劳动人民眼睛是雪亮的。过去你欺骗不了我们，现在你更欺骗不了我们。我们要用毛泽东思想武装起来，和你斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
