    Deng Tuo, clinging to the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, visited the old kiln owners who had drained the blood of the miners when he arrived in Mentougou, but did not visit the old miners. He wrote a history of wealth accumulation for the capitalists, while ignoring the tragic history of the miners in the old society.

    We feel great indignation at the counter-revolutionary crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang of bourgeois black gangsters and the despicable acts of the "Three-Family Village" black shop in opposing the Party and the people! Deng Tuo, leading his accomplices, "broke out" when our country's economy encountered temporary difficulties, released a large number of poisonous weeds, and launched a rampant attack on the Party and socialism. This was by no means accidental, but determined by their reactionary bourgeois nature. Today, we will use the following facts to further expose Deng Tuo's consistent reactionary bourgeois face.

Speaking out for Capitalists and Complaining

    In 1957, just as the anti-Rightist struggle was in full swing across the country, Deng Tuo suddenly had an impulse. Leisurely, he came to the Mentougou Mining Area in Kyoto West, under the guise of being the editor-in-chief of the *People's Daily* and a "scholar," to conduct a so-called "on-the-spot investigation," and swindled away a batch of coal mine historical data that had been preserved for many years. Soon after, he wrote an article entitled "From Wanli to Qianlong—An Argument on the Budding Period of Chinese Capitalism," which he collected in his book *Several Issues on Chinese History* (published by Sanlian Bookstore in 1959). In this article, Deng Tuo deliberately distorted historical facts, and through a series of tedious textual research, cited a large number of old coal kiln contracts and documents, painstakingly writing a history of wealth accumulation for the reactionary coal kiln owners—capitalists—who cruelly exploited the miners.
    Deng Tuo passionately spoke out for the newly emerged capitalists, complaining, "It is not difficult to imagine how brutally the feudal rulers of the Qing Dynasty oppressed the private kiln owners." His basis was: "Emperor Kangxi sent 'Master Yu' to visit Mentougou privately, causing many private kiln owners to lose both their wealth and their people." In fact, the feudal officials and kiln owners of the Ming and Qing dynasties colluded with each other, and sometimes, due to conflicting interests, they often squeezed each other out. Deng Tuo took a clear stand on the side of the capitalists in this dog-eat-dog struggle, and sang a lament for the premature death of Chinese capitalism. He repeatedly said: "If historical conditions continued to be conducive to the growth of capitalist factors in China, then China could very well have independently developed into a capitalist society. Unfortunately, the development of history encountered a serious setback." Look, Deng Tuo felt as mournful as losing his parents at the premature death of Chinese capitalism. Doesn't this clearly illustrate Deng Tuo's position? Not only that, Deng Tuo also praised the kiln owners in a sickening manner for possessing "qualities" of "cooperating with one heart and mind, working hard, being patient and amiable, and being utterly impartial and selfless." He also defended the kiln owners' inhumane behavior of exploiting miners with ulterior motives, saying that this was because "under the severe oppression of feudal forces, if the kiln owners did not adopt some degree of extra-economic coercive measures to strengthen the exploitation of kiln workers, then it would be even more difficult for them to continue commodity production and capital accumulation." That is to say, the kiln owners' exploitation of the kiln workers was not determined by their nature, but was a last resort.

Ignoring the Tragic History of Miners in the Old Society

    Is this really the case? No, definitely not! What exactly were the private kiln owners who were praised as heroes and heroines in Deng Tuo's writing? They were landlords, usurers, and bureaucratic politicians in feudal society. In the long years of more than 300 years of the Ming and Qing dynasties, they turned Mentougou into a hell on earth. They bought a large number of child laborers and bonded laborers through vicious contracts of indenture, depriving these workers of the right to a free life. Under their cruel enslavement, these workers became beasts of burden and slaves, leading to family ruin, wives and children being separated, and a tragic fate of gradually moving towards death. The old miners said that no one lived past the age of forty in the old days, and after they died, no one buried them at all, and they were thrown onto the river beach to feed the dogs by the wolf-hearted kiln owners. In the past, there was an old folk song circulating in Mentougou: "If you have half a bowl of porridge at home, don't go to Mentougou; if you come to Mentougou, it's like entering a den of tigers and wolves; there is no way to live in the human world, hell eats more people!" The miners' blood and sweat fattened the kiln owner masters, who lived a dissolute and shameless life. The coal miners who were liberated from the pit of fire by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao will always remember this countless blood debt. But Deng Tuo shouted grievances for the kiln owners, and lightly glossed over the miners' tragic situation. He said, "In order to study the exploitation of hired workers and the cost accounting of commodity production by the private kilns at that time, I tried my best to investigate and collect various account books of the old kilns, but I couldn't find them." And, "To what extent did the kiln owners exploit the kiln workers at that time? How much profit did the kiln industry have? Because of the lack of sufficient materials, it is still difficult to make a more complete judgment." …. Look how lightly he speaks, and it is no wonder, because Deng Tuo, who insists on the reactionary bourgeois stand, cannot see these historical materials at all.
    Everyone knows that in feudal society, the main sign of the budding of capitalism is the emergence of capitalist relations of production, that is, the emergence of the production relations in which capitalists exploit the surplus labor of hired workers. Deng Tuo does not mention this at all in his article, but vigorously praises the history of the private kiln owners' wealth accumulation, from which we can see the extent of his sinister intentions.

Reactionary Face Fully Exposed

    As the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together, and people are divided into groups." Let's look back at how Deng Tuo conducted this "on-the-spot investigation." The people he was looking for were not the old miners who had suffered so much in the old society and had deep-seated hatred for the kiln owners, but he eagerly "visited many old kiln owners," and had heart-to-heart talks with those vipers who had drained the blood of the miners, and affectionately called Wang Shanxiang, the kiln owner's lackey and overseer, "Technician Comrade Wang Shanxiang." Such living facts just happen to expose Deng Tuo's reactionary face without being beaten.
    At the end of the article, Deng Tuo openly clamored arrogantly: "This complex and tortuous process has also left many painful imprints in the industrial history of the Mentougou coal mine. For example, the Mentougou Sino-British Coal Mining Company in the late Qing Dynasty squeezed out many private kilns, and it also relied on feudal bureaucratic forces to support bureaucratic capital and exclude and打击the private kiln economy. All these facts should be written in our history, so that the people will always remember the lessons of historical experience." Look, these are the "facts" that Deng Tuo wants to write into our history and the "lessons of experience" that he wants us to "always remember"! Would we easily believe this nonsense? No, what we want to remember is not the collapse of the private kilns, not the premature death of capitalism, but the class hatred and history of blood and tears of millions of miners! Not only that, we must also settle this blood debt with them—Deng Tuo and his gang of bourgeois black gangsters!
    At present, a small group of evil dogs in the "Three-Family Village" has been beaten into the water by the people. We must carry forward Lu Xun's spirit of beating drowning dogs, and, together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, thoroughly defeat this group of demons and monsters, and resolutely get rid of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.

    从对门头沟矿区的调查看邓拓反动的阶级立场
    坚持资产阶级反动立场的邓拓，到了门头沟，不去访问老矿工，而去访问喝尽矿工鲜血的老窑主。他为资本家编了一部发家史，却无视旧社会矿工的悲惨历史
    京西矿务局　邬廷铭、萧笃君
    我们对邓拓等一伙资产阶级黑帮的反革命罪行和“三家村”黑店反党反人民的卑鄙勾当，感到极大的愤慨！邓拓率领着他的同伙，在我们国家经济遇到暂时困难的时候“破门而出”，放出大批毒草，向党和社会主义展开了猖狂进攻，这决不是偶然的事情，而是由他们资产阶级的反动本性决定的。今天，我们用下面的事实，来进一步揭露邓拓一贯的资产阶级反动面目。为资本家伸冤诉苦
    一九五七年，正当全国范围内的反右派斗争轰轰烈烈进行的时候，邓拓却忽然心血来潮，悠悠闲闲地来到京西门头沟矿区，以《人民日报》总编辑和
  “学者”的身份做幌子，进行了一次他所谓的“实地调查”，骗走了一批保存多年的煤矿历史资料。不久，他写成了《从万历到乾隆——关于中国资本主义萌芽时期的一个论证》一文，把它收集在他的《论中国历史的几个问题》（三联书店一九五九年出版）一书中。在这篇文章里，邓拓蓄意歪曲历史事实，通过一系列的烦琐考据，引证了一大堆旧煤窑的契约和文书，苦心孤诣地为残酷压榨矿工的反动煤窑业主——资本家们编了一部发家史。
    邓拓大动感情地为初出笼的资本家们伸冤诉苦，说什么：“不难想见，清朝的封建统治者对于民窑业主们多么残暴地进行压迫。”其根据是：“康熙皇帝派了‘于大人’私访门头沟，害得许多民窑人财两空。”实际上，明清的封建官府和窑主们是狼狈为奸的，有时为了利害关系，他们之间又常常互相排挤。邓拓在这种狗咬狗的斗争中，态度鲜明地站在资本家一边，为中国资本主义的夭折大唱挽歌。他反复地说：“如果历史条件继续便利于中国资本主义因素的成长，那末，中国完全有可能独立发展成为资本主义社会。不幸的是，历史的发展却遭遇了严重的顿挫。”请看，中国资本主义的夭折竟会使邓拓感到如丧考妣似的沉痛，这不是很明显地说明了邓拓的立场吗？不仅如此，邓拓还肉麻地赞美窑主们具有“协力同心，刻苦营运”，“忍耐和气，至公无私”的“品德”。他并别有用心地为窑主剥削矿工的惨无人道的行为开脱罪责，说什么这是“在封建势力的严重压迫之下，窑主们如不采用某种程度超经济的强制的办法加强对窑工的剥削，那末，他们要继续商品生产和资本积累就更要困难的多了”。这就是说，窑主对窑工的剥削竟然不是他们本性决定的，而是不得已为之的。无视旧社会矿工的悲惨历史
    事情难道果真是这样的吗？不，决不！在邓拓笔下被歌颂成英雄豪杰的民窑业主们究竟是些什么东西呢？他们就是封建社会里的地主、高利贷者和官僚政客。在明清两朝三百多年的漫长岁月里，他们把门头沟变成了一座惨无人道的人间地狱。他们用狠毒的卖身契的方式买下了大批的童工和包身工，剥夺了这些工人自由生活的权利。在他们残酷的奴役下，这些工人做牛马，当奴隶，弄得家破人亡、妻离子散，一步一步走向死亡的悲惨命运。老矿工们说，旧日的矿工没有能活到过四十岁以上的人，他们死后根本没有人埋葬，而被狼心狗肺的窑主们扔到河滩上喂狗。过去，门头沟流传着一个古老的民谣：“家有半碗粥，不到门头沟；来到门头沟，如入虎狼窝；人间无活路，地狱吃人多！”矿工的血汗，养肥了窑主老爷们，他们过着荒淫无耻的生活。被共产党、毛主席从火坑里解放出来的煤矿工人，他们永远记得这数不清的血债。而邓拓却直着嗓子替窑主们喊冤，对于矿工的悲惨境遇，轻轻一笔带过。他说什么：“为了研究当时民窑对于雇工的剥削和商品生产的成本计算等问题，我曾尽力调查和收集老窑的各种账本，可是没有找到。”又说什么：“当时窑主们对窑工的剥削究竟达到了什么程度？窑业的利润究竟有多少？因为缺乏充分的材料，还难以作出较完全的判断。”……。你看他说得多么轻松，这也难怪，因为坚持资产阶级反动立场的邓拓，是根本看不见这些历史资料的。
    谁都知道，在封建社会里，资本主义萌芽的主要征兆是资本主义生产关系的产生，也就是资本家剥削雇佣工人剩余劳动的生产关系的产生。邓拓在文章里绝口不谈这些，反而大肆颂扬民窑业主的发家史，从这里可以看出其居心之险恶程度。反动嘴脸充分暴露
    俗话说：“人以群分，物以类聚”，让我们再回过头来看看邓拓是如何进行这次“实地调查”的吧。他要找的不是在旧社会受尽摧残，对窑主们怀着血海深仇的老矿工，而是迫不及待地“访问了许多老窑主”，和那些喝尽矿工鲜血的毒蛇们促膝谈心，把窑主的狗腿子大作（把）头王善祥亲热地称为“技术员王善祥同志”。这样的活生生的事实，正巧不打自招地暴露了邓拓的反动嘴脸。
    邓拓在文章的末尾，还公然狂妄叫嚣：“这一段复杂曲折的过程在门头沟煤矿工业史上同样留下了许多惨痛的烙印。例如，清朝末年的门头沟中英煤矿公司曾经挤垮了许许多多民窑，它并且依托封建官僚势力，扶植官僚资本，排斥和打击民窑经济。这一切事实都应该写在我们的历史上，让人民群众永远记得历史的经验教训。”请看，这就是邓拓要写进我们历史的“事实”和要我们“永远记住”的“经验教训”！我们难道会轻易相信这种胡说八道吗？不，我们要记住的不是什么民窑的垮台，不是什么资本主义的夭折，我们要记住的是千百万矿工的阶级仇和血泪史！不仅如此，我们还要向他们——邓拓这一伙资产阶级黑帮清算这笔血债！
    目前“三家村”的一小撮恶狗已经被人民打下水了，我们要发扬鲁迅先生打落水狗的精神，和全国工农兵一道，彻底打垮这批牛、鬼、蛇、神，坚决搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线。
