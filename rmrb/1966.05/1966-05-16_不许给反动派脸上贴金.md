    No Laudatory Remarks for Reactionaries Permitted
    Qi Guanghua, Commune Member (Yi Nationality), Yongding Commune, Fumin County, Yunnan

    The movie "Two Stage Sisters" is a poisonous weed. It propagandizes to the audience that revolution can succeed through individual struggle without the leadership of the Party. The movie only arranges for an unidentified reporter named Jiang Bo to say a few words of encouragement to Chunhua, and then Chunhua bravely fights the reactionaries and achieves victory without much difficulty. Can things be that easy? Absolutely impossible! Take the events in my hometown as an example. Before liberation, in 1947, Fumin County suffered a natural disaster, and many farmers couldn't get enough to eat and were starving. They spontaneously gathered in groups to go to the Kuomintang county government to beg for relief grain. Not only did the reactionaries refuse to give grain, but they also ordered the police to whip and beat the poor farmers with clubs, driving everyone away. The peasant brothers didn't get a single grain of rice but were left with injuries. Facts prove that without the leadership of the Party, struggle cannot be victorious. Why do the authors of the movie promote the idea that revolution can succeed without the leadership of the Party? It is very clear that they dream of using the poison of "individual struggle" to harm our broad masses of people, leading us away from the leadership of the Communist Party, taking the path of bourgeois individualism, and undermining the socialist revolution and socialist construction. We must fiercely expose these people's conspiracies and tricks.

    The courts and government offices of the old society served the reactionaries such as landlords and bureaucrats, specifically oppressing the working people. As the saying goes:
    "The yamen gate faces south, those with reason but no money shall not enter." This is absolutely true. Take my family's situation as an example. Before liberation, we didn't have a house to live in, or land to cultivate. We only had a small forest patch a little over an acre in size, and the family relied on cutting firewood to sell for a living. Our family's forest was right next to the forest of the local tyrant landlord Li Jianzhong. Li Jianzhong had malicious intentions and seized our family's forest. My father argued with him, but the vicious landlord instead bribed the yamen, sent out his thugs to tie my father up and take him to the county yamen to imprison him, saying he would be detained for a year. My mother rushed to the county yamen and pleaded, and finally, the poor villagers scraped together three dou of rice to bribe the yamen official before they released my father. This is the kind of place the yamen of the old society was! They relied on reversing right and wrong, framing the poor, eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the poor to live their lives. The movie, however, portrays the courts of the old society as so good, the judges as so democratic and reasonable, and that Chunhua could righteously expose the conspiracy of Tang's manager and his gang; and without much effort, win the lawsuit. The screenwriters and directors of the movie did this deliberately to put gold on the faces of the reactionaries, with the aim of telling the masses that the reactionaries also have good intentions, that they should not hate the reactionaries, and that they should not engage in class struggle.

    Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us, "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between the various political forces, the class struggle in the ideological field between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is

    不许给反动派脸上贴金
    云南富民县永定公社社员（彝族）　戚光华
    电影《舞台姐妹》是株毒草。它向观众宣传：没有党的领导，靠个人奋斗，革命也可以成功。电影里只安排了一个身份不明的新闻记者江波，对春花讲了几句鼓励的话，春花就非常勇敢地和反动派斗，而且也没经过多少困难就取得了胜利。能有那样便宜的事吗？根本不可能！就拿我们家乡的事情做例子。解放前，一九四七年，我们富民县遭了天灾，好多农民吃不上饭，饿得不行，就自发地成群结伙到国民党县衙门去讨施米。反动派不给米不说，还命令警察用皮鞭用棍棒抽打穷苦农民，把大伙赶走。农民兄弟没要到一粒米，倒落下一身伤。事实证明，如果没有党的领导，斗争是没法胜利的。为什么电影的作者要宣传没有党的领导，革命也可以成功呢？很清楚，他们是梦想用“个人奋斗”这服毒药毒害我们广大人民群众，让我们离开共产党的领导，走资产阶级个人主义的路，破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设。我们要狠狠揭穿这些人的阴谋诡计。
    旧社会的法庭、衙门，都是为地主官僚等反动派服务，专门欺压劳动人民的。俗话说：
  “衙门口朝南开，有理无钱莫进来。”真是一点不错。拿我们家的事情做例子。解放前，我们家住没房屋，种田没有土地，只有一亩大点的林子，一家就靠打点柴卖过生活。我家这块林子同恶霸地主李建中家的森林紧挨着，李建中起了歹心，霸占了我家的林子。我父亲和他评理，穷凶极恶的地主，反倒买通衙门，派出狗腿子把我父亲捆绑到县衙门去坐牢，说是要关押一年。我母亲赶到县衙门好说歹说，最后由穷乡亲凑足三斗米的钱塞给衙门管事的人，才把我父亲放出来。这就是旧社会的衙门！他们就靠颠倒黑白、陷害穷人、吃穷人的肉、喝穷人的血过日子。电影却把旧社会的法庭写得那么好，法官那样民主、那样讲理，还能让春花理直气壮地揭露唐经理这伙坏蛋的阴谋；而且不费什么力，就把官司打赢了。电影的编剧、导演所以这样做，是存心给反动派脸上贴金，目的是要告诉人民群众，反动派也有好心肠的，不要仇恨反动派，不要进行阶级斗争。
    毛主席一再教导我们，“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”当前文化战线上这场大破黑线的斗争，正是说明阶级斗争还很尖锐复杂，我一定要好好学习毛主席著作，不断提高分辨香花和毒草的能力，积极参加这场文化大革命，和全国阶级弟兄一道，铲除《舞台姐妹》这株毒草，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神。
