    Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Commentary by our agency reporter: On May 12th, five U.S. bandit planes intruded into the airspace of northeastern Maguan area, Yunnan Province, China, ambushed and shot down a Chinese training plane. Today, we are publishing photos of the missile debris and auxiliary fuel tanks dropped by the U.S. bandit planes in the aforementioned area when they attacked our plane. With irrefutable evidence, the crime of U.S. imperialism deliberately antagonizing the Chinese people and carrying out serious war provocations against the Chinese people is absolutely undeniable.

    After this serious war provocation, U.S. officials in Washington and Saigon remained silent. Only after China lodged a strong protest did they hurriedly come out to make statements, attempting to fabricate lies to deny and shirk their responsibility.

    The spokesman for the U.S. invading forces in Saigon said first that they "shot down a communist plane," then claimed its "nationality was unknown" and "did not see any markings on the plane." He said at one moment that the event occurred 105 miles northwest of Hanoi, 25 to 30 miles south of the Chinese border, and then said it was 115 miles northwest of Hanoi, 50 miles from the Chinese border. They even fabricated a bizarre myth, claiming that U.S. aircraft "over North Vietnam" "fired two missiles, and besides the plane that was shot down, may have hit another plane. This plane may have stayed in the air for two or three minutes before crashing in Chinese territory." These self-contradictory lies, slapping themselves in the face, completely expose the embarrassed appearance of the U.S. aggressors acting guilty.

    U.S. officials in Washington originally wanted to stay behind the scenes and remain silent, but seeing the loopholes in the lies fabricated by the Saigon U.S. military spokesman, they were forced to hurriedly come out and say that they had no evidence to prove that Chinese aircraft had flown from Chinese bases into Vietnam. Both the White House spokesman and the State Department spokesman "refused to comment" on China's protest. "[They are] unwilling to say anything to confirm or deny China's claims."

    The fact is still the fact, and it cannot be denied. A wealth of evidence is present, and now is the time for the gentlemen in Washington to admit their guilt. We can tell you: The debris of the missiles used by the U.S. bandit planes when they intruded into Chinese airspace and ambushed our training planes, and the seven auxiliary fuel tanks that were dropped, all landed in the northeastern Maguan area of our Yunnan Province. The auxiliary fuel tanks are printed with the words "Sargent-Fletcher Company of California, USA." Did this happen "over North Vietnam"? Would a Chinese plane bring auxiliary fuel tanks from U.S. fighter jets onto Chinese territory?

    It should be pointed out that this serious war provocation against China by U.S. imperialism is by no means accidental. This event occurred precisely when Washington was intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam and making shameless war threats against China. This situation cannot but arouse the high vigilance of the Chinese people. U.S. President Johnson has recently convened consecutive meetings of the National Security Council, the highest military decision-making body in the U.S., to plan further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. U.S. bandit planes have recently intensified their indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam. The U.S. military in Saigon announced that on the 12th alone, U.S. aircraft carried out 135 attacks on North Vietnam, greatly exceeding previous records. U.S. newspapers revealed that the U.S. military is also preparing to implement a "major escalation of the war," bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. For half a month, officials in Washington have repeatedly clamored that there is "no sanctuary" in the war of aggression against Vietnam, creating public opinion for U.S. bandit planes to violate Chinese airspace and plotting to expand the flames of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam to China. Obviously, this provocative act by the U.S. aggressors is part of the U.S.'s plan to expand the war.

    Regarding this conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to expand the war of aggression, the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense has solemnly pointed out in a statement: "The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are prepared. The blood debt owed to the Chinese people by U.S. imperialism must be repaid." The Chinese people keep their word. If U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will certainly accompany them to the end. Once the war starts, there will be no boundaries. The U.S. aggressors will not escape the fate of being completely, cleanly, and totally eliminated.

    美帝国主义欠下中国人民的血债一定要偿还！
    我国公布美机袭击我机的罪证
    美帝绝对赖不掉战争挑衅罪责
    美国官方编造的谎言自相矛盾，完全暴露了美国侵略者作贼心虚的窘相
    新华社十七日讯　本社记者述评：五月十二日，美国强盗飞机五架，侵入中国云南省马关东北地区上空，偷袭并击落中国训练飞机一架。今天，我们公布了美国强盗飞机在袭击我机时丢在上述地区的导弹残骸和副油箱的照片。罪证如山，美帝国主义蓄意与中国人民为敌，向中国人民进行严重战争挑衅的罪行，是绝对抵赖不了的。
    在这个严重战争挑衅事件发生后，华盛顿和西贡的美国官方一直不敢作声。直到中国提出强烈抗议后，他们才被迫慌慌张张地出来发表谈话，企图编造一些鬼话来进行抵赖，推卸罪责。
    西贡侵越美军发言人一会儿说“击落了一架共产党飞机”，一会儿又说“国籍不明”、“没有看到飞机上的标志”。他一会儿说什么事情发生在河内西北一百零五英里，中国边界以南二十五到三十英里处，一会儿又说什么在河内西北一百一十五英里，离中国边界五十英里处。他们还编造一个离奇古怪的神话，说什么美国飞机在“北越上空”“发射了两枚导弹，除了打下的那架飞机外，还可能击中了另一架飞机。这架飞机可能在空中呆了两三分钟，然后在中国境内坠毁。”这些自相矛盾，自己打自己嘴巴的谎言，完全暴露了美国侵略者作贼心虚的一副窘相。
    华盛顿的美国官方本想躲在后面不吭声，但是看到西贡美军发言人编造的谎言漏洞百出，实在不象个样子，才被迫急急忙忙地出来说，他们没有证据证明，中国的飞机曾经从中国基地飞入越南。白宫发言人和国务院发言人都对中国的抗议“拒绝评论”。“不愿意说任何话来证实或否认中国的说法”。
    事实终归是事实，赖是赖不了的。大量的罪证俱在，现在是华盛顿的先生们低头认罪的时候了。我们可以告诉你们：美国强盗飞机侵入中国领空，偷袭我训练飞机时所使用的导弹的残骸和丢下的七个副油箱，都落在我云南省的马关东北地区。副油箱上面印有美国“加利福尼亚州萨金特—佛莱彻尔公司”制造的字样。这难道是发生在“北越上空”吗？难道中国飞机会把美国战斗机上的副油箱带到中国领土上吗？
    应该指出，美帝国主义这次对中国的严重战争挑衅，决不是偶然的。这件事情正是发生在华盛顿加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，并且发生在对中国进行无耻的战争威胁的时候，这种情况不能不引起中国人民的高度警惕。美国总统约翰逊最近几天连续召开美国最高的军事决策机关国家安全委员会会议，策划进一步扩大侵越战争。美国强盗飞机最近变本加厉地对越南北方进行狂轰滥炸。西贡美国军方宣布，十二日一天中，美国飞机对越南北方进行了一百三十五次袭击，大大超过以往纪录。美国报纸透露，美国军方还准备实行“战争的重大升级”，轰炸河内、海防。华盛顿的官员们半个月来一再叫嚷在侵越战争中“没有庇护所”，为美国强盗飞机侵犯中国领空制造舆论，阴谋把美国侵越战争的战火扩大到中国。显然，美国侵略者这次的挑衅行为，是美国扩大战争计划的一部分。
    对于美帝国主义这种扩大侵略战争的阴谋计划，中国国防部发言人在谈话中已经严正指出：“中国人民和中国人民解放军是早有准备的。美帝国主义欠下中国人民的血债是一定要偿还的”。中国人民说话是算数的，如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加到中国人民头上，中国人民一定奉陪到底。战争打起来，就没有界限。美国侵略者就逃脱不了它被彻底、干净、全部地消灭的命运。
