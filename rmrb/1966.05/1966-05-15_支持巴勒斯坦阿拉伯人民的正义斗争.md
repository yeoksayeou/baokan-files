    Today is "Palestine Day." The Chinese people will launch various activities to support the Palestinian Arab people in their struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and Zionists, and for the return to their homeland.
    The Palestinian Arab people have lived in their own homeland for generations, but for more than a decade, they have been forced to leave their homes and live as displaced, homeless refugees. The Palestinian Arab people have every right to return to their homeland. Their just struggle has won the sympathy and support of the Asian and African people and the people of the world.
    The main enemy of the Palestinian Arab people is U.S. imperialism. Israel is an aggressive base created by U.S. imperialism in the Middle East, and a sharp knife inserted by U.S. imperialism into the Middle East and Arab countries. The Washington ruling clique has consistently supported and aided Israel, especially by continuously strengthening Israel's armed forces, threatening the peace and security of Arab countries. As recently as February of this year, the United States openly transported 200 Patton tanks to Israel; then in early April, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs made new weapons requests to the United States. The Arab people have seen with their own eyes that U.S. imperialism, like sucking the blood of the Arab people, plunders the oil wealth of the Arab countries, and at the same time uses Israel to carry out aggression and provocations against Arab countries. Recently, after holding the so-called Middle East Envoys Conference, U.S. imperialism is further plotting subversive conspiracies in the Arab region. Therefore, while resolutely opposing Israeli Zionism, the Palestinian people and the people of Arab countries must inevitably direct the spearhead of their struggle at the heinous U.S. imperialism.
    On the one hand, U.S. imperialism supports Israel in taking a hard line against the people of Arab countries; on the other hand, it has brought out the old trick of taking a soft line, trying in every possible way to get the Arab people to "reconcile" with the Zionists and recognize the status quo of Israel, that is, to recognize the persecuted and humiliated status of the Palestinian Arabs. It must be pointed out that in this evil plan of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leading group is playing the role of a partner. The collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Israeli Zionists is well known. Recently, the Soviet press has been actively advocating the use of the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to resolve "conflicts" in various regions. The Soviet magazine "New Times" blatantly clamored for resolving the disputes between Israel and Arab countries through the "Tashkent spirit." This is a despicable conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist leading group colluding with U.S. imperialism, betraying the interests of the Palestinian Arab people and the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab countries.
    However, the people of Arab countries and the Palestinian Arab people cannot be deceived. Arab public opinion not long ago gave a sharp rebuttal to the fallacy that the so-called "Tashkent Declaration" is a "model" for the Middle East. The Palestine Liberation Organization has repeatedly declared that armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine. This is precisely the correct conclusion drawn by the Palestinian Arab people and the people of Arab countries in their own struggle practice.
    The Chinese people are the most reliable and most faithful friends of the Arab people. We have always supported the struggle of the Palestinian people and the people of Arab countries against imperialism and new and old colonialism, and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence, and resolutely maintained that the sovereignty of Arab countries should be respected by all other countries, and opposed infringement and interference from any side. The Chinese people firmly support the struggle of the Arab people against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, and firmly support the struggle of the Palestinian Arabs to return to their homeland. We believe that as long as the Palestinian Arab people, with the strong support of the Arab countries and the people of the world, carry out a persistent struggle, final victory will surely belong to the Palestinian people and the people of Arab countries.

### 支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的正义斗争

    支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的正义斗争
    今天是“巴勒斯坦日”。中国人民将展开各种活动，声援巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和犹太复国主义者、争取重返家园的斗争。
    巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民曾经世世代代生活在他们自己的乡土上，可是，十多年来，他们却被迫背井离乡，过着颠沛流离、无家可归的难民生活。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民有一切权利，重返自己的家园。他们的正义斗争得到亚非人民和全世界人民的同情和支持。
    巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的主要敌人，是美帝国主义。以色列是美帝国主义在中东制造出来的一个侵略基地，是美帝国主义插入中东和阿拉伯国家的一把尖刀。华盛顿统治集团一贯支持和援助以色列，特别是不断地加强以色列的武装力量，威胁阿拉伯各国的和平和安全。仅仅在今年二月间，美国就公开地把二百辆巴顿式坦克运交给以色列；接着在四月初，以色列外交部又向美国提出了新的武器要求。阿拉伯人民亲眼看到，美帝国主义象吮吸阿拉伯人民的鲜血一样，掠夺了阿拉伯国家的石油财富，同时还利用以色列对阿拉伯国家进行侵略和挑衅。最近，美帝国主义在召开了所谓中东使节会议后，正在阿拉伯地区进一步策划颠覆阴谋活动。因此，巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民在坚决反对以色列犹太复国主义的同时，必然地要把斗争的矛头指向万恶的美帝国主义。
    美帝国主义一方面支持以色列对阿拉伯各国人民采取硬的一手；另一方面又搬出了老一套的软的一手，千方百计地要阿拉伯人民同犹太复国主义者“和解”，承认以色列的现状，即承认巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人受迫害、受屈辱的地位。必须指出，在美帝国主义的这一罪恶计划中，苏联修正主义领导集团扮演着合伙者的角色。苏联修正主义者同以色列犹太复国主义者的勾搭，这是众所周知的。最近，苏联报刊积极鼓吹用所谓“塔什干精神”来解决各地区的“冲突”。苏联《新时代》杂志露骨地叫嚷通过“塔什干精神”来解决以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的争端。这是苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，出卖巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民利益和阿拉伯各国人民反帝斗争的一个卑鄙的阴谋。
    但是，阿拉伯各国人民和巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民，是欺骗不了的。阿拉伯国家的舆论不久以前对所谓“塔什干宣言”是中东
  “榜样”的谬论，给予了尖锐的驳斥。巴勒斯坦解放组织一再宣告：武装斗争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路。这正是巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民在自己的斗争实践中所得出的正确结论。
    中国人民是阿拉伯人民最可靠、最忠实的朋友。我们一贯支持巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，坚决主张阿拉伯国家的主权应当得到一切其他国家的尊重，反对来自任何方面的侵犯和干涉。中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争，坚决支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人重返家园的斗争。我们相信，只要巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民在阿拉伯国家和全世界人民的有力支援下，进行坚持不懈的斗争，最后胜利一定属于巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民。
