　　People's Steel Transportation Line
　　China News Delegation
　　On the battlefields of South Vietnam, there are many steel transportation lines made up of tens of thousands of heroic sons and daughters. In the towering mountains, men and women of all ethnic groups use rattan backpacks to carry weapons, ammunition, and food, climbing wooden ladders on cliffs and crossing suspension bridges made of rattan to reach the front lines. In the dense forests of the plains, teams of male and female laborers push bicycles, drive ox carts, and carry shoulder poles, transporting various supplies to the troops. At night, on the intricate network of small rivers in the south, large and small ships loaded with supplies surge forward, and captured vehicles speed through the forests in the dark. When American planes circle and reconnoiter, these streams of people and vehicles suddenly disappear into the jungle. When the American planes fly away after fruitless reconnaissance, the transportation army reappears on the roads, advancing in a mighty manner. The United States dispatches hundreds of aircraft and drops millions of tons of bombs to block a road, but the transportation teams open up two or three new roads in other places. This is an indestructible and unblastable steel transportation line, and also a people's transportation line that operates day and night, rain or shine.
　　One day, as we were advancing in the deep mountains and dense forests, we happened to be walking alongside a women's transportation team from various ethnic groups. They were a dozen or so people, including the Katu, Kado, and Ve ethnicities, the oldest being twenty-four years old and the youngest nineteen. They carried heavy ammunition in rattan backpacks, the lightest weighing over thirty kilograms and the heaviest over fifty kilograms. The captain, Looi, a twenty-two-year-old Kado girl, carried over sixty kilograms. She led everyone steadily along the steep mountain roads, which were full of gravel and gnarled roots. This was a narrow path carved out of the bushes on the cliffs. On one side of the road were towering, abrupt peaks, and on the other side were deep valleys filled with dense forests. The dense foliage of tall trees covered the path. American planes constantly circled and reconnoitered overhead, but all they saw was a vast expanse of forest. The female transportation team members agilely climbed steep slopes, ascended wooden ladders built on the cliffs, and crossed log bridges and rope bridges made of rattan, carrying ammunition to the front lines as quickly as possible.
　　The weather in South Vietnam is changeable. Suddenly, dark clouds covered the sky, and a fierce wind howled through the jungle, plunging the forest into darkness. Before long, a torrential downpour began, producing a roaring sound in the forest. The female transportation team members had already tightly wrapped their backpacks with rain tarps to prevent the ammunition from getting wet. They leaned on wooden sticks picked up from the forest, bent over, and struggled to advance step by step against the storm. Captain Looi constantly encouraged everyone along the way, urging them to learn from the spirit of the People's Liberation Army in fighting the American devils and to resolutely complete the transportation mission. This was a group of tenacious and admirable female transportation team members. To ensure the victory of the battle, they braved the storm and rushed to the front lines.
　　After walking for more than an hour in the storm, we finally arrived at the transportation team's resting place. This was a dilapidated thatched hut built in the jungle. They lit bonfires in the hut and set up wooden tripods over the fires, hanging small aluminum pots to boil water to drink. We sat around the bonfire, drying our wet clothes, and the girls' hearty laughter echoed throughout the small hut. As we chatted, the girls all praised their female captain.
　　Female Captain Looi is a famous model figure on this transportation line. She grew up in a poor Kado peasant family in this mountainous area, suffering from the oppression and bullying of the American-puppet clique and feudal chieftains. After the Liberation Army liberated her hometown, she refused the marriage arranged by her parents and signed up to join the transportation team. She has now been fighting on this transportation line for nearly four years. Her spirit of not fearing hardship, not fearing difficulties, and resolutely completing the transportation mission has won the respect and praise of all the transportation team members. When she first joined the transportation team, she could only carry twenty or so kilograms, but later she constantly exercised her physical strength and finally could carry sixty kilograms. During an emergency rush to transport supplies, she even carried seventy kilograms. Regardless of wind, rain, or darkness, no matter how far the journey, she resolutely completed the transportation mission on time. Once, enemy aircraft blockaded a ferry crossing day and night, so she led everyone to open a road in the thorny bushes, detoured to the upstream of the river, swam across the rapid current in the dark, and continued to clear the way in the dark, delivering the supplies to their destination on time. The transportation team she led has been repeatedly commended by higher authorities.
　　The storm stopped, and the sunlight shone through the scattered clouds, making the mountains and valleys verdant and filled with fresh air. The female captain and some other team members immediately took us to see the crops they had planted. On small plots of land cleared in the jungle, the stems and leaves of the cassava they had planted were already more than a meter tall, and the tender shoots of corn had also sprouted. These lands were all reclaimed by them during their rest breaks.
　　When we were interviewing in the D liberated area near Saigon, we once again went to the front with an armed transportation team. They were all strong young men, some pushing bicycles loaded with several large bags of grain, and some carrying a large bag of grain like a backpack. They all carried automatic weapons, and their bodies and vehicles were camouflaged with branches and leaves, ready to fight the encountered enemies at any time. American jet planes flew over the jungle, making strange howls. They circled and reconnoitered on the nearby roads and avenues, and bombed and strafed, but they were just wasting their efforts and could not stop the advance of the hundreds and thousands of transportation team members in the jungle.
　　The captain of this transportation team, Nguyen Duc, was a battle-tested and energetic young man in his twenties. He carried a large bag of grain and a submachine gun at the front, humming combat songs, and held a machete in his hand, cutting off the branches and thorns that protruded from both sides of the road. His machete had opened up many such paths in the jungle.
　　The transportation team came to a small stream and camped here. They lit a small oil lamp made of a small glass bottle, and everyone gathered around, using the dim light to open the rice wrapped in plastic cloth, adding some salted shrimp paste in small cans to eat.
　　We asked them to talk about their stories of combat and life. Captain Nguyen Duc said to us in an excited tone, "I want to tell you a story about a hero on our transportation line. He gave his life to protect the grain sent to the front lines and his comrades. Compared to him, we have done too little and too poorly and need to make greater efforts."
　　This hero was named A Cheng. He was originally a worker in Saigon and joined the transportation team not long ago. One day, his transportation team was in the process of delivering a large batch of grain to the front when they suddenly discovered that several companies of American invading troops were searching and surrounding them. The transportation captain immediately ordered everyone to prepare for battle and quickly retreat into the depths of the jungle to try to break out of the enemy's encirclement and safely deliver the batch of grain to the troops. At this critical moment, A Cheng handed the bag of grain he was carrying to another comrade and quickly circled behind the enemy with his submachine gun. He deliberately exposed himself and opened fire on the enemy. As soon as the gunfire rang out, the enemy rushed in his direction. He stubbornly held back the enemy, jumping from one tree to another to fight the enemy. Finally, he fell heroically. At that moment, the transportation team quickly ran out of the enemy's encirclement. The grain was not damaged at all and was all delivered to the troops.
　　While we were talking, American planes were constantly circling over the jungle. The small oil lamp was lit and extinguished again and again, and finally it was simply not lit. The pale light of the flares dropped by the American jet planes, which made piercing whistles, and the strong flashes of the American night reconnaissance planes, which made constant snapping sounds, faintly illuminated the jungle through the dense foliage. Finally, Nguyen Duc's high-pitched voice overwhelmed the roar of the planes: "We must learn from A Cheng. In front of us, there are no impassable roads, and there are no undeliverable supplies."
　　These heroes who fight on the transportation line day and night are admired and loved by the Liberation Army soldiers. They praise these heroes as "good soldiers with iron shoulders and steel feet." This indestructible and unblastable steel transportation line, composed of these steel warriors, has made a great contribution to ensuring the victory of the Liberation Army's battles.

    人民钢铁运输线
    中国新闻代表团
    在越南南方的战场上，有许许多多条由成千成万英雄儿女组成的钢铁运输线。在丛山峻岭中，各民族男女用野藤制成的背篓背着武器、弹药和粮食在木梯上攀登绝壁，越过悬崖上用野藤结成的吊桥赶到前线去。在平原的密林中，一队队男女民工推着自行车、赶着牛车、挑着担，把各种物资运到部队去。夜里，在南部密如蛛网的小河道上，大大小小满载的船只破浪前进，缴获来的汽车在森林中摸黑奔驰。在美国飞机盘旋侦察的时候，这一股股人流、车流，忽然在丛林中消失不见了，等美国飞机侦察无结果飞走的时候，运输大军又出现在道路上浩浩荡荡地向前开去。美国出动几百架次飞机，投下千万吨炸弹来封锁一条道路的交通，但是运输队员又在另外地方开辟出来了两条、三条新的道路。这是一条打不垮、炸不烂的钢铁运输线，也是一条夜以继日、风雨无阻的人民运输线。
    有一天，我们在深山密林中行进的时候，正好同一队各民族的妇女运输队走在一起。她们十多个人，包括有卡都、卡当、维三个民族，年纪最大的二十四岁，最小的十九岁。她们用野藤制成的背篓背着沉重的弹药，最少的有三十多公斤，多的有五十多公斤。队长洛伊是一个二十二岁的卡当族姑娘，背了六十多公斤。她带着大家在陡峭的、到处是碎石块和虬结的树根的山路上稳健地行进着。这是在山崖上树丛里开辟出来的一条羊肠小道，路一边是峭峻的兀突的奇峰，另一边是密布林海的深谷。高耸的树木的茂密的枝叶，覆盖了这条小道。美国飞机不断地在上空盘旋侦察，但是看到的只是一片茫茫的林海。女运输队员们敏捷地爬上陡坡，攀登架在崖壁上的木梯，扶着野藤结成的扶手跨过独木桥和用野藤结成的绳索桥，把弹药尽快运到前线去。
    越南南方的天气是多变的。突然，乌云密布了天空，狂风在丛林上猛烈呼啸起来，林子里一片天昏地暗。不一会，暴雨就倾泻似的倒下来了，在林子里发出了哗哗的巨响。女运输队员们早已把雨布严严地包住了背篓，不让弹药受一点雨淋。她们扶着从林子里拣来的木棍，弯着腰，一步一步顶着暴风雨费力地前进。队长洛伊一路上不断地鼓励着大家，学习解放军打击美国佬的精神，坚决完成运输任务。这是一群顽强和令人敬佩的女运输队员。她们为了保证战斗的胜利，冒着暴风雨奔向前线。
    在暴风雨中走了一个多小时以后，我们终于来到了运输队的歇脚处。这是搭在丛林中的一间破茅屋。她们在屋子里燃起了一堆堆篝火，又在篝火上架起了木头的三角架，挂上了小铝锅，烧开水喝。我们围着篝火坐下来，烤干身上湿漉漉的衣服，姑娘们的爽朗的笑声，响彻了小小的茅屋。在我们闲谈的时候，姑娘们一个个都夸起她们的女队长来了。
    女队长洛伊是这条运输线上有名的模范人物。她生长在这个山区的一家卡当族的贫苦农民的家里，受尽了美伪集团和封建酋长的压迫和欺凌。在解放军解放她的家乡后，她拒绝了父母给她说的婚事，报名参加了运输队。到现在，她已在这条运输线上战斗近四年了。她不怕艰苦，不怕困难，坚决完成运输任务的精神，受到了全体运输队员们的敬佩和赞扬。她刚参加运输队的时候，只能背二十多公斤，后来她不断锻炼自己的体力，终于能背六十公斤，在一次紧急抢运物资的时候，她还背过七十公斤重。不管风雨、黑夜，不管多远的路程，她都坚决按时完成运输任务。有一次，敌机夜以继日地封锁一个渡口，她就率领大家在荆棘丛莽中开出一条路来，绕到了河流的上游，在黑夜里游过了湍急的水流，又摸黑继续开路，按时把物资送到了目的地。她率领的运输队一再受到了上级的表扬。
    风雨停止了，阳光从四散的云块中射出来，满山满谷青翠欲滴，一片清新的空气。女队长和其他一些队员立刻带我们出去看看她们种的庄稼。在丛林里开辟出来的一小块又一小块的土地上，她们种的木薯的杆叶已经长得一人多高，玉米的嫩苗也已经出土了。这些土地都是她们利用歇脚休息的时间开垦的。
    我们在西贡附近的D解放区采访的时候，又有一次同一个武装运输队一起到前方去。他们都是些年青力壮的小伙子，有些人推着装上了几大口袋粮食的自行车，有些人象背包一样背着一大口袋的粮食。他们都背着自动武器，身上和车上都插着枝叶的伪装，随时准备同遭遇的敌人进行战斗。美国喷气飞机发出怪啸声在丛林上空飞过，在附近的公路和大道上又是盘旋侦察，又是轰炸扫射，但是，它们只是白花气力，怎么也阻挡不了丛林中的成百成千队的运输队员的前进。
    这个运输队的队长阮德是一个久经战斗考验的精力充沛的二十多岁的小伙子，他背着一大口袋粮食和一支冲锋枪走在前头，嘴里哼着战斗歌曲，手里拿着一把砍刀，顺手把路两边伸出来的枝丫和荆棘砍掉，他的这把砍刀已在丛林中开辟了许多条这样的小道。
    运输队来到了一条小溪流旁边，在这里歇营。他们点起了一盏用小玻璃瓶做成的小油灯，大家围在一起，凑着微弱的灯光打开包在塑料布里的米饭，加上一些装在小罐头里的盐虾酱吃起来。
    我们请他们大家谈谈他们的战斗和生活的故事。队长阮德用一种激动的语调对我们说，“我要给你们讲我们运输线上一个英雄的故事，他为了保护送到前线去的粮食和战友们而付出了自己的生命，比起他来，我们做得太少太差，还要作更大的努力。”
    这个英雄名叫阿成，原先是西贡市内的一个工人，参加运输队不久。有一天，他那个运输队正在把一大批粮食送到前方去的途中，突然发现有几个连的美国侵略军正在一面搜索一面包围上来。运输队长立刻命令大家准备战斗，并且迅速撤进丛林深处，设法跳出敌人的包围圈，把这批粮食安全送到部队去。就在这紧急的时刻，阿成把身上背的一口袋粮食交给了另外一个同志，自己提着冲锋枪迅速绕到了敌人的背后去。他故意暴露自己，对敌人猛烈开火。枪声一响，敌人都朝他那个方向涌去。他死死拖住了敌人，从一棵树跳到另一棵树同敌人进行战斗，最后他英勇地倒下去了。就在这一刻，运输队飞快地跑出了敌人的包围圈，粮食没有受一点损失，全部送到了部队。
    正在谈着的时候，美国飞机不断地在丛林上空盘旋，小油灯点了又熄，熄了又点，最后索性不点了。发出刺耳啸声的美国喷气飞机投下的照明弹的惨白色的光亮，不断发出拍拍拍声音的美国夜间拍摄照片的侦察机发出的强烈闪光，透过浓密的枝叶微微地照亮了丛林。最后，阮德的高昂的声音压倒了飞机的轰鸣：“我们要向阿成学习，在我们前面，没有走不通的道路，没有送不到的物资。”
    这些日日夜夜战斗在运输线上的英雄们受到了解放军战士们的敬佩和热爱，他们称赞这些英雄们是“铁肩钢脚的好战士”。这条由这些钢铁战士组成的炸不烂、打不垮的钢铁运输线，为保证解放军战斗的胜利作出了巨大的贡献。（附图片）
