    The Era of Farmers Consciously Mastering Agricultural Science Begins
    ——Mass Scientific Experiment Activities in Nantong Commune, Minhou County, Fujian Province
    中共南通公社委员会 (CPC Nantong Commune Committee)
    Editor's Note: Nantong Commune in Minhou County is a typical unit for mass scientific experiment activities in rural areas nationwide. Their experience enlightens people: Do you want to truly carry out scientific experiments? Then you must highlight politics, take class struggle as the key link, and promote scientific experiments; if you only focus on scientific experiments themselves, you will never do well.
    Conducting scientific experiments in rural people's communes is to continuously develop collective production and consolidate the collective economy. As the material from Nantong Commune illustrates, elements opposing the consolidation of the collective economy sabotage scientific experiments, people with all kinds of "old views" doubt scientific experiments, and some scientific and technological personnel look down on the ability and role of peasant masses in conducting scientific experiments. The Nantong Commune Party Committee grasped the key link of class struggle and the struggle between two roads, promoted proletarian ideology and eliminated bourgeois ideology, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of poor and lower-middle peasants for conducting scientific experiments for the sake of revolution, and enabled the commune's scientific experiments to achieve great victories along the correct direction, overcoming various difficulties. This experience of Nantong Commune has great universal significance.
    The vast number of peasants consciously mastering agricultural science is a major event of epoch-making significance. The Nantong Commune Party Committee insisted on creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and on arming the peasant masses with Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, things that people in the past could not imagine they dared to imagine, and things that people in the past could not do they dared to do. Through the revolutionary movement of scientific experiments, the subjective world of the people was changed, and thus the objective world of Nantong Commune was also changed.
    Nantong Commune, Minhou County, is located in the lower reaches of the Dazhang River, close to the Wulong River, a tributary of the Min River. The commune has more than 23,500 mu of cultivated land, with an average of less than eight fen per person. Before liberation, disasters frequently occurred here, with "nine lean years out of ten," and the people's lives were very difficult.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, relying on the collective economy, farmland capital construction was carried out, flood control dikes were built, disaster resistance capabilities were enhanced, and production technology was also improved to some extent, resulting in significant development in production. By 1956, the average grain yield per mu had reached more than 700 jin, nearly double that before liberation. However, the serious problem of waterlogging had not been resolved, and important material conditions and technical issues such as seeds, fertilizers, plant protection, cropping systems, and close planting had not been addressed. For three consecutive years, the area suffered severe natural disasters, especially in June 1961, when a severe flood occurred, and grain production regressed to the level of the early post-liberation period.

    Change or Not? Rely on Whom to Change?
    It is an urgent demand of the vast number of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to change the poor and backward state of Nantong Commune. However, where is the way out? After analysis, the Commune Party Committee believed that the fundamental reason why production could not increase at that time was that there were complex and acute class struggles and struggles between two roads within the commune, and the Party Committee had not grasped class struggle tightly. Therefore, a serious ideological struggle was carried out from within the Party to outside the Party, through summarizing experiences, recalling comparisons, and conducting extensive debates, initially unifying the understanding of the entire Party that class struggle must be grasped tightly, resisting unhealthy tendencies, and stabilizing the collective economy.
    With the direction issue resolved, how can production be improved faster and better? All parts of the country are changing, and some advanced units in agricultural production have emerged in the county. Can Nantong change? In 1962, the leading cadres of the commune, with this question in mind, visited and learned from the Lianban Brigade of Chengmen Commune, which had changed both quickly and well, three times. After returning, the first thing they did at the Party Committee meeting was to conduct a serious discussion on the topic of "Lianban is changing, the whole country is changing, should Nantong change, can Nantong change, how to change, and rely on whom to change." Through "comparing with the advanced and finding the gaps," most comrades believed that compared with Lianban, there were three shortcomings: First, revolutionary thinking was not as good; they dared to make revolution, while we were timid and hesitant; second, revolutionary work style was not as good; their Party Branch Secretary Huang Baoluo had been planting experimental plots since 1951, delving into production practice and mastering first-hand information, while we talked more and did less, adhering to the old methods of urging planting and harvesting; third, the promotion of new technologies was not as good; they practiced short-stalk varieties, close planting, and continuous cropping, while we practiced tall-stalk varieties, sparse planting, and intercropping.
    Views on this issue were not consistent among the members of the Party Committee. Some people remembered the attacks made by class enemies in the past on cadres planting experimental plots, and felt a little timid, believing that the Party Committee should focus on ideology, and the peasants would handle production themselves. They put the word "fear" first, simply seeking "stability," and using "seeking truth from facts" as an excuse, they dared not move forward. In this situation, our Party Committee re-studied Chairman Mao's instructions on seeking truth from facts in "Reform Our Study," and summarized the experiences and lessons of leading agricultural production since 1958 using the viewpoint of "one divides into two," criticizing the idea of seeking "stability" one-sidedly and being afraid to make revolution. We unanimously realized that not seeking in-depth understanding of agricultural production and planting according to "old habits and old methods" was not "stability," let alone seeking truth from facts; only by studying and exploring the objective laws of agricultural production through class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments, and actively leading production, could we truly adopt an attitude of seeking truth from facts. That kind of conservative "stability" is a manifestation of a lack of revolutionary spirit.
    Can it be changed? Everyone again used Lianban as a mirror and conducted discussions. Originally, the soil quality of Lianban was not as good as that of the adjacent Pandun, so grain production was also not as good as that of Pandun. Before liberation, there was a saying, "Poor Lianban, golden Pandun." However, after liberation, because Lianban achieved revolutionary farming and scientific farming, its output surpassed Pandun Brigade in just a few years, becoming an advanced unit in the county. Everyone believed that the road of Lianban was the road of Nantong. If a foundation as "poor and blank" as Lianban's could be changed, Nantong could also be changed.
    After unifying ideological understanding, it is necessary to solve the problem of relying on whom to change, and to solve the problem of whether to believe that peasants can engage in science. Chairman Mao taught us that all the Party's work must rely on the masses and follow the mass line. Land reform and cooperativization were all carried out by cadres personally taking action, relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, and fully mobilizing the masses. Scientific experiment is a revolutionary struggle to change the world. It is impossible to succeed without the participation of the broad masses. Our commune lacks technical strength, with only three agricultural technology station cadres with secondary specialized education. We need to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, rely on poor and lower-middle peasants, and boldly mobilize the masses to carry out the revolutionary movement of scientific experiments.
    Before 1962, our commune had an old farmer advisory committee. At the beginning, we underestimated the role of this organization, and only let them "consult" and "advise." In the spring of 1962, Zhang Xiangzao (张祥灶), our commune's "old farmer advisor" (now a peasant breeder from Qiaojie Brigade), was the first to participate in the agricultural group meeting held by the Minhou County Science and Technology Association. He asked Wang Maoyu (王茂玉), a peasant breeder in the county, for 20 jin of high-quality dwarf-foot Nanthe No. 1 variety seeds, and planted 2.2 mu, achieving a yield of 604 jin per mu, an increase of 51.4% compared with the tall-stalk varieties planted under the same conditions. This incident gave us great inspiration. Through the practice of activities organized by the County Agricultural Society and the commune's old farmer advisory committee (later renamed the agricultural group), we gradually tasted the sweetness of summarizing the experiences of peasants and gradually realized that the productive practice of peasants is an infinitely rich source of science and technology. For example, from the experience of old farmers that "farming requires managing the seedling fields well," we realized the importance of "sparse sowing and cultivating strong seedlings"; from the experience summary of Qiaojie Brigade not having rotten seedlings for seven consecutive years, we realized the truth that practice produces science. Since then, we have gradually changed our views on old farmers, regarding them as the backbone of carrying out mass scientific experiment activities. Old farmers' understanding of scientific farming has also changed: In the past, old farmers had a sense of mystery about science and were separated from technical cadres, believing that "you are foreign, and I am local." Now old farmers and technical cadres are equally members of the agricultural group. Everyone gathers together, exchanges experiences, discusses each other, and speaks freely, truly achieving the three-way combination of cadres, old farmers, and technical personnel. In the past, old farmers only talked about old experiences. Now, through scientific experiments, old farmers have created something new and can also talk about new things when attending meetings. All of these have gradually clarified our understanding of whether farmers can engage in science.
    In 1963, Chairman Mao put forward the development of the three great revolutionary movements. We organized more than 1,200 cadres, Party members, League members, and activists from the entire commune to conduct serious study, further improving their understanding of scientific experiments. In that same year, the commune promoted dwarf-foot Nanthe on 1,300 mu, and the incidence of rice borers was greatly reduced. The total output of early rice achieved a bumper harvest, an increase of 48% compared with 1962. Under this situation, we organized the broad masses to conduct a major summary lasting more than 20 days, profoundly educating the cadres and masses. We found that wherever production changes were significant, revolutionary farming and scientific experiments were consciously or unconsciously combined; the production teams where the 13 old farmer advisory committee members were located had outstanding increases in production. This bumper harvest further made us realize that leading production must have a revolutionary spirit and, at the same time, scientific methods; agricultural technology reform is not just a matter for technical departments but must involve a vigorous mass movement; among the peasant masses, there is a wealth of traditional experience that must be well explored and summarized.
    In 1964, we put scientific experiments on the agenda of the Party Committee and used the advanced deeds of Qiaojie Brigade, which transformed from backward to advanced in our commune, peasant experts Huang Baoluo and Wang Maoyu in our county, and peasant experts Zhang Xiangzao and Lin Yunchang in our commune to explain that scientific experiments are about exploring the laws of agricultural production and farming using scientific methods; science comes from production practice, and the peasant masses can completely become masters of agricultural science; carrying out scientific experiments is related to the vital interests of the Party, the country, and the commune members, and is related to anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world, encouraging everyone to advance towards agricultural science. In scientific experiment activities, we regarded the peasants as the main body of the rural mass scientific experiment movement, the poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force in the mass scientific experiment movement, and further organized the broad masses according to the principle of the three-way combination of cadres, old farmers, and educated youth, and plunged them into the revolutionary movement of scientific experiments.
    The tremendous role of peasants in scientific experiments has gradually become apparent. In 1965, the entire commune, with scientific experiment groups as the core, established more than 4,200 mu of model fields for crops such as rice, and more than 1,700 mu of experimental fields, seed fields, and high-yield fields. In the seed aspect alone, the entire commune has introduced and tested 171 different varieties of grain and oil crops over the years. At the same time, technical night schools were established, and old farmers Zhou Yiliu (周依六), Pan Yuxuan (潘玉煊), and the leaders of the scientific experiment central groups in each brigade served as teachers in the technical night schools, giving technical lessons to educated youth and teachers and students of Nantong Middle School. The commune also organized 18 farmers with experience in planting dwarf-foot Nanthe to form a "peasant lecturer group" to pass on their knowledge to 12 production brigades. This method of educating farmers by farmers is practical for the speakers, cordial for the listeners, and quickly accepted. The peasant masses also used literary forms such as ballads and short dramas to bring the practice of scientific experiments to the stage, reflecting the era spirit of farmers engaging in science. This not only popularized scientific knowledge but also promoted advanced figures and advanced ideas, promoted the cultural revolution in socialist rural areas, promoted changes in people's mental outlook, and consolidated the socialist ideological front in rural areas.
    From these years of work, we have gradually realized that knowledge comes from practice, and science belongs to the people. The era of a few people monopolizing science has begun to pass, and the era of the peasant masses mastering agricultural science has begun to arrive. At a meeting of the commune agricultural group, everyone collectively created a poem to praise the peasants' emancipation in science. The poem says: Scientific experiments bloom red flowers, Everywhere you look are native experts, Not doctors or overseas students, We are all farmers.

    Great Changes in Nantong
    Nantong has changed.
    Since 1962, grain production in Nantong Commune has continuously increased, and the income of commune members has increased year by year. By 1965, the total collective grain output of the entire commune increased by 25.6% and 115% compared with 1964 and 1961, respectively; the average yield per mu reached 1,112 jin, an increase of 25.1% and 148% compared with 1964 and 1961, respectively, and an increase of about 50% compared with 1956, the year with the highest output before the commune. While grain production has continued to increase, diversified operations other than citrus have also developed. With the development of production, the lives of commune members have gradually improved, and the socialist collective economy has been increasingly consolidated. The food grain collectively distributed to commune members in 1965 increased by 17% compared with 1964; the average annual income per commune member increased by 33% compared with 1964. In 1965, the entire commune supported the state with more than 7.3 million jin of grain, an increase of about 26% compared with 1964; public accumulation reached 470,000 yuan; and reserve grain reached 360,000 jin. The enthusiasm of commune members to participate in collective production labor has generally increased.
    At present, Nantong Commune has initially solved more than 20 key production technologies such as promoting dwarf-stalk fine varieties, continuous cropping and close planting, improving sulfuric acid fields, preventing and controlling rice diseases and insect pests, preventing citrus root rot disease, artificially hatching domestic fish, and cultivating straw mushrooms. These all come from the masses, go to the masses, start from the current local production needs, and serve the current local production.
    Nantong Commune's preliminary change in its poor and backward state in a relatively short period of time is due to highlighting politics and highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. They took class struggle as the key link and Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, promoting the development of the scientific experiment revolutionary movement; at the same time, through scientific experiments, they changed people's mental outlook, which in turn promoted class struggle and the struggle between two roads, and consolidated the collective economy; this has far-reaching significance for realizing the intellectualization of intellectuals, the knowledge of laboring people, gradually narrowing the gap between mental and physical labor, and cultivating revolutionary successors.
    First, people's class consciousness has been raised. In the entire process of scientific experiments, there is not only a struggle between the advanced and the backward but also an acute class struggle. Class enemies and wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas scolded us for engaging in scientific experiments as "a toad wanting to eat swan meat," and more seriously, they carried out direct sabotage. We mobilized the masses and carried out resolute struggle, which enabled production and scientific experiments to develop smoothly. The masses said: "The Communist Party is truly wise, class struggle is effective when grasped, scientific experiments show great power, and agricultural production has a great harvest."
    Second, the cadres have changed. The leadership style has become more in-depth, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, and bureaucracy has decreased. In the past, when we formulated production plans, we had no idea what we were doing, and leading production often relied on administrative methods to urge planting and harvesting. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, squatting to participate in labor and scientific experiments, we gradually explored some objective laws of agricultural production, and we had a better idea of what we were doing in leading production, and our words were more effective. At present, many cadres have shown a new atmosphere of three changes (ideology, work style, and cadre-masses relationship), three activenesses (work, labor, and scientific experiments), and three more (knowledge, methods, and labor).
    Third, the peasant masses have changed. Among peasants with low levels of education, even illiterates, "science enthusiasts" have emerged. Zhang Yuying (张玉英), an old poor peasant in Guashan Brigade, used her own money and cloth coupons to purchase seed bags and got up in the middle of the night to take care of seeds during soaking. Three old farmers near the age of sixty in the Qinxing Production Team of Yinan Brigade also started comparative experiments of different varieties and different densities of "spring sowing backward." The old idea of "eating and wearing clothes for decades, farming without science" has been replaced by "learn until old" and "believe in ghosts and gods, nothing can be accomplished, talk about science, and there will be good harvests every year."
    Fourth, the educated youth have changed. The entire commune has more than 1,500 educated youth with high elementary school or higher education. When they first returned to their hometowns, most of them looked down on labor, looked down on peasants, and were not at ease in the countryside. Class enemies also used the weaknesses in the thinking of the youth and carried out fierce struggles with us. We seized these issues, organized the youth to study Chairman Mao's works, organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to tell them the "three histories," helped them improve their awareness, and automatically exposed and struggled against the conspiracies of class enemies. We also organized clubs, ran night schools, and scientific laboratories according to the characteristics of the youth, guiding them to study Chairman Mao's works, carry out recreational activities, educate them to learn from old farmers, actively participate in production labor and scientific experiments, and pay attention to letting them take on observation and recording, surveying and reporting, testing seeds, soil rapid testing and chemical analysis, and popular science literary propaganda. Now most of the youth are more at ease, have begun to develop labor habits, have mastered certain production technologies, and have seen that the countryside has vast prospects, laying a good ideological foundation for becoming red in the countryside and specialized in the countryside. Among more than 100 educated youth in Yinan Brigade, 109 are now backbones of various grassroots organizations, and 52 have been rated as five-good commune members. College student Pan Shanzhi (潘善治) was not at ease when he first returned, and when he was asked to participate in labor, he said he was "sick" and covered his face with a bamboo hat when he saw people. Now he can carry more than 100 jin, has learned general farm work, and actively takes the lead in organizing soil rapid testing, and is known as the "field doctor."
    Fifth, the various departments have changed. The Party branch of the supply and marketing cooperative highlighted politics, vigorously grasped the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and made greater contributions to scientific experiments. They actively participated in soil testing, helped scientific experiment groups establish soil archives, supplied different fertilizers according to different soils, and guided scientific fertilization; they vigorously organized the supply of calcium carbide slag, duckweed mothers (for breeding red duckweed), sweet potato seedlings, etc., to meet the needs of various teams for production and scientific experiments; inspired by the spirit of "the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," they used indigenous methods and, after 13 experiments, successfully cultivated more than 20,000 bottles of straw mushroom spores, so that the production of straw mushrooms in the entire commune in 1965 developed from one brigade to 15 brigades, increasing collective income by more than 20,000 yuan, and supporting the development of straw mushroom production in other areas with spores. People praised that this supply and marketing cooperative is like a research institute and a technical service station, and it has also enlivened business.
    The agricultural technology station is closely combined with mass scientific experiments, and the work of technology promotion has taken root. They actively guide scientific experiment groups, summarize and promote the results of mass scientific experiment activities, and improve the scientific and technological level of the members of each group, and their work has become much more active than in the past. The commune-run agricultural middle school has also promoted the combination of theory and practice, improved teaching, and served production by participating in scientific experiments. Other departments such as the food company, transportation station, handicraft cooperative, hospital, primary and secondary schools, tax office, bank, and grain station have also actively cooperated and participated in the scientific experiment movement.
    The entire Party has devoted itself to the three great revolutionary movements, and the three great revolutionary movements have exerted incomparable power. This makes us more deeply appreciate the great significance of Chairman Mao's instructions that the three great revolutionary movements "are a reliable guarantee for Communists to be free from bureaucratism, avoid revisionism and dogmatism, and stand forever in an invincible position, and a reliable guarantee for the proletariat to unite with the broad masses of working people and implement democratic dictatorship."

    Several Experiences
    Over the past few years, we have been learning as we do in the mass scientific experiment movement, and we have the following experiences.
    1. Take class struggle as the key link and grasp the three great revolutions together. The Party Committee must first thoroughly understand the spirit of the three great revolutionary movements. The three great revolutionary movements are a whole, which are interconnected and mutually promote each other. Class struggle and the struggle between the two roads are the key link. The most important thing in carrying out the revolutionary movement of scientific experiments is to highlight politics, arm cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and establish the idea of farming for the revolution and farming with a revolutionary spirit and scientific methods. Put scientific experiments effectively on the agenda of the Party Committee, and at the same time as deploying various central tasks to various departments and units, put forward tasks and requirements for scientific experiments. Politics must be highlighted from beginning to end when promoting advanced experience and publicizing science and technology.
    2. Cadres at all levels personally squat at points to create models, cultivate typical examples, and promote the overall situation. Starting in 1962, we established three models of rice, green manure, and citrus in Qiaojie, Guashan, and Bayi Brigades, respectively. Because we obtained first-hand information during squatting, our words were powerful, and the promotion of advanced technologies went smoothly. At present, our commune has models for grain, fruit trees, green manure, animal husbandry, aquaculture, and forestry. Eight commune Party Committee members squat at different points to create models, cultivate typical examples, and promote the overall situation. The grain model Qiaojie Brigade, which was originally "last" in the commune, has now become an advanced team, winning the high-yield red flag for several consecutive years and being hailed as the "technical staff headquarters" of the entire commune. The cadres of each production brigade also squat at different points in 32 production teams to create models and promote the overall situation by grasping points.
    3. Start from reality and encircle key issues. "The Party Committee sets the topic, and the group writes the article." Once you have set your sights on something, grasp it firmly, grasp it to the end, and concentrate your efforts to encircle and annihilate it. Several key technical issues such as planting, protection, density, and improvement in our commune have been resolved in this way. There is often a process from successful experimentation to promotion, and the masses cannot fully understand and master many things that have been successfully tested. What to do? The best way is to let the facts speak for themselves, organize the masses to further experiment, and ask the masses to personally taste the "pear." This is how we closely combine experimentation, demonstration, and promotion, from one point to many points, from many points to the overall situation, from model demonstrations to large-scale promotion. Our experience is that the drive must be great, the steps must be steady, and the war of annihilation must be based on boldly mobilizing the masses and "everything through experimentation" to be invincible.
    4. Cultivate backbones. Backbones emerge from the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments and are cultivated through the method of mass movements. At present, our commune has established 28 scientific experiment pacesetters. Among these pacesetters, there are "old farmer head" Zhou Yiliu, "youth head" Pan Shanzhi, and "women head" Chen Youzhu, etc. With them as the core, they lead the 340-plus members of the scientific experiment central group in the entire commune; then, through the latter, they lead the 1,200-plus members of the scientific experiment group.
    5. Carry out comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing, and constantly revolutionize. To make scientific experiments unfold persistently and deeply, they must be twisted into a rope with the comparison, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing movement in production, constantly revolutionize, and constantly advance. After the 28 scientific experiment pacesetters were established, we called on the broad masses of cadres and people in the entire commune to learn from them. We also carried out a "three checks and three comparisons" competition among cadres at all levels and scientific experiment groups, namely, check leadership and compare organization; check system and compare activities; check plan and compare results. Scientific experiments were also made one of the contents of evaluating five-good cadres, with small evaluations in the quarters and overall evaluations at the end of the year. In the evaluation in the first half of 1965, among the 50 brigade cadres, 36 had done better in scientific experiments.
    6. Run science diligently and frugally. Implementing the principle of running science diligently and frugally is an important issue in carrying out mass scientific experiment activities. The experimental projects should be practical, not for show, to achieve high output, low cost, less labor, and more income; the experimental conditions should be simple, take local materials, and not be greedy for big and foreign things, to spend less money, do more things, and do good things. At present, the scientific experiment central groups in the 16 brigades of our commune have generally set up small, simple laboratories as the "technical rear" for carrying out mass scientific experiments. The simple instruments and equipment displayed in the laboratory are also mainly created by the hands of the peasant masses, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.
    7. Organize a mass scientific experiment network as a powerful assistant and shock force for leading the scientific experiment movement. Scientific experiment is a great revolutionary movement, which must be led by the Party Committee in a unified manner. But there must also be an office to handle daily specific affairs; otherwise, if everything is handled by the Party Committee, it will not be so specific.
    Over the past few years, although we have done some work in the unified grasp of the three great revolutions and the development of mass scientific experiment activities, it is only the beginning. In terms of production, we have only initially changed the poor and backward state. The current output level is not high, and cultivation is not detailed enough. In terms of scientific experiments, development is not balanced enough. The summary of mass production experience is not enough. The training of the mass scientific and technological team has not been grasped forcefully enough.
    In order to further improve the scientific experiment movement and strive for a comprehensive good harvest in agricultural production in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, we must first highlight politics, take Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all our work, study Chairman Mao's works better, make the political atmosphere stronger, and conscientiously learn from fraternal units to make our scientific experiments better.

    农民自觉掌握农业科学的时代开始了
    ——福建省闽侯县南通公社的群众性科学实验活动
    中共南通公社委员会
    编者按：闽侯县南通公社是全国农村群众科学实验活动的典型单位。他们的经验启示人们：你想要真正开展科学实验么？那你就必须突出政治，以阶级斗争为纲，推进科学实验；如果就科学实验抓科学实验，那是永远搞不好的。
    在农村人民公社搞科学实验，是为了不断发展集体生产，巩固集体经济。正象南通公社的材料所说明的，反对巩固集体经济的分子破坏科学实验，有着种种“老眼光”的人们怀疑科学实验，某些科技人员轻视农民群众进行科学实验的能力和作用。南通公社党委抓紧阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的纲，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，把贫下中农为了革命而进行科学实验的积极性充分调动起来，使全公社的科学实验，沿着正确的方向，排除种种困难，取得巨大胜利。南通公社的这个经验，很有普遍的意义。
    广大农民自觉地掌握农业科学，是一件有着划时代意义的大事。南通公社党委，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持用毛泽东思想武装农民群众，这样，前人所不能想的事情敢想了，前人所不能作的事情敢作了，通过科学实验这个革命运动，改变了人们的主观世界，也就改变了南通公社的客观世界。
    闽侯县南通公社地处大樟溪下游，紧靠闽江支流乌龙江边。全社有耕地二万三千五百多亩，平均每人不到八分地。解放前，这里灾害频繁，“十年九歉收”，群众生活十分困苦。
    解放后，在党的领导下，依靠集体经济，进行了农田基本建设，修建了防洪堤，增强了抗灾能力，生产技术也作了一些改进，生产有了很大的发展。到一九五六年，粮食亩产平均达到七百多斤，比解放前将近翻了一番。但是，严重的内涝问题还没有解决，种子、肥料、植保、耕作制度、密植等项重要物质条件和技术问题，都没有过关。连续三年遭到严重自然灾害，特别是一九六一年六月，发生了特大水灾，粮食产量又退到解放初期的水平。		变不变？靠谁变？
    必须改变南通公社的贫穷落后面貌，这是广大干部和贫农下中农的迫切要求。但是，出路在那里？公社党委经过分析认为，当时生产上不去的根本原因是，公社内部存在着复杂尖锐的阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争，而党委则没有抓紧进行阶级斗争。于是从党内到党外，通过总结经验、回忆对比和大鸣大放大辩论，进行了一场严重的思想斗争，初步统一了全党对于必须抓紧阶级斗争的认识，顶住了歪风邪气，稳定了集体经济。
    方向问题解决了，怎样才能把生产更快更好地搞上去呢？全国各地都在变，本县也出现了一些农业生产的先进单位，南通能不能变呢？一九六二年公社领导干部带着这个问题，三到变得既快又好的城门公社连坂大队参观取经。回来后，首先在党委会上，以“连坂在变，全国在变，南通要不要变，能不能变，怎样变，依靠谁来变”为题，进行了认真的讨论。通过“比先进，找差距”，多数同志认为和连坂比，有三个不如：一是革命化思想不如，人家敢于革命，我们畏缩不前；二是革命化作风不如，人家党支部书记黄宝洛从一九五一年就开始种试验田，深入生产实际，掌握第一性资料，我们是说得多，做得少，墨守催收催种的老一套领导方法；三是推广新技术不如，人家是矮秆、密植、连作，我们是高秆、稀植、间作。
    对于这个问题的看法，党委会成员认识并不一致。有人想起过去阶级敌人对干部种试验田所进行的攻击，心里就有些胆怯，认为党委抓思想就行了，生产农民自己会搞。他们怕字当头，单纯求“稳”，借口“实事求是”，不敢前进。在这种情况下，我们党委会重新学习毛主席在《改造我们的学习》中关于实事求是的指示，用一分为二的观点，总结了一九五八年以来领导农业生产的经验教训，批判了那种片面求“稳”的不敢革命的思想。一致认识到，对农业生产不求甚解，按“老习惯、老办法种田”，不是“稳”，更不是实事求是；只有通过阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，去研究和探索农业生产的客观规律，积极领导生产，这才是真正的实事求是的态度。那种因循守旧的“稳”，是缺乏革命精神的表现。
    能不能变呢？大家又拿连坂作镜子，进行了讨论。原来连坂的土质不如毗邻的潘墩，因此粮食产量也不如潘墩，解放前有“土连坂，金潘墩”之称。可是，解放以后由于连坂实现了革命种田和科学种田，没过几年产量就超过了潘墩大队，成为全县的先进单位。大家认为连坂的道路就是南通的道路，象连坂那样“一穷二白”的底子能够变，南通也能够变。
    在统一了思想认识后，就要解决一个依靠谁来变的问题，就要解决相信不相信农民能办科学的问题。毛主席教导我们，党的一切工作，都要依靠群众，走群众路线。土改、合作化，都是干部亲自动手，依靠贫农下中农，充分发动群众搞起来的。科学实验是一场改天换地的革命斗争，没有广大群众的参加是不可能成功的。我社技术力量缺乏，只有三个中专程度的农技站干部，需要发扬自力更生的革命精神，依靠贫农下中农，放手发动群众，开展科学实验的革命运动。
    一九六二年以前，我社有个老农顾问委员会。开始，我们对这个组织的作用估计不足，只是让他们“参谋参谋”、“顾问顾问”。一九六二年春，我社的“老农顾问”张祥灶（现桥街大队农民育种家），第一个参加了闽侯县科学技术协会召开的农学组会议，向本县农民育种家王茂玉同志要回二十斤矮脚南特号良种，试种二点二亩，亩产达六百零四斤，比同等条件种植的高秆品种增产百分之五十一点四。这件事给了我们很大的启示。通过县农学组和公社老农顾问委员会（后改为农学组）活动的实践，使我们逐步尝到了总结农民经验的甜头，逐步体会到农民的生产实践，是无限丰富的科学技术源泉。例如，我们从老农“种田要管好秧地”的经验中，体会到了“稀播种、育壮秧”的重要性；从桥街大队连续七年不烂秧的经验总结中，体会到了实践出科学的真理。从此，我们逐步改变了对老农的看法，把他们作为开展群众性科学实验活动的骨干力量。老农对科学种田的认识也有了改变：过去老农对科学有神秘感，和技术干部有隔膜，认为“你是洋的，我是土的”，现在老农和技术干部一样是农学组成员，大家共聚一堂，交流经验，相互讨论，畅所欲言，真正地做到了干部、老农、技术人员三结合；过去老农只是谈老经验，现在老农，通过搞科学实验，有所创造了，开会时也能谈新的东西了。这些都使我们对农民能否办科学的认识逐步明确起来。
    一九六三年，毛主席提出了开展三大革命运动。我们集中全社一千二百多名干部、党团员和积极分子，进行了认真的学习，进一步提高了对科学实验的认识。就在这一年，全社推广了一千三百亩的矮脚南特，螟害率也大大降低，早稻总产量取得了比一九六二年增长百分之四十八的大丰收。在这种形势下，我们组织广大群众，进行了二十多天的大总结，深刻地教育了干部和群众。我们发现凡是生产变化显著的地方，都是自觉或不自觉地把革命种田和科学实验结合起来抓的；十三个老农顾问委员会成员所在的生产队，增产突出。这次大丰收进一步使我们认识到领导生产必须要有革命的精神，同时要有科学的办法；农业技术改革，不仅仅是技术部门的事，必须大搞革命的群众运动；在农民群众中，有着丰富的传统经验，必须很好地发掘和总结出来。
    一九六四年，我们把科学实验列入了党委议事日程，并且以落后变先进的本社桥街大队、本县农民专家黄宝洛和王茂玉、本社农民专家张祥灶和林云长的先进事迹，来阐明科学实验就是探索农业增产的规律，用科学的方法种田；科学来自生产实践，农民群众完全可以成为农业科学的主人；开展科学实验，关系到党、国家和社员群众的切身利益，关系到反帝、反修和世界人民的革命事业，鼓励大家向农业科学进军。在科学实验活动中，我们把农民作为农村群众科学实验运动的主体，把贫农下中农作为群众搞科学实验运动的主力军，并且根据干部、老农、知识青年三结合的原则，把广大群众进一步组织起来，投入到科学实验革命运动中去。
    农民在科学实验中的巨大作用，逐步显示出来了。一九六五年，全社以科学实验小组为核心，建立了水稻等作物样板田四千二百多亩，试验田、种子田、丰产田一千七百多亩。仅种子一项，全社几年来就引种试种了不同粮油作物品种一百七十一个。同时办起了技术夜校，老农周依六、潘玉煊和各个大队的科学实验中心组组长，当了技术夜校的老师，给知识青年和南通中学的师生上技术课。公社还组织十八个对矮脚南特有种植经验的农民成立“农民讲师团”，到十二个生产大队去传经。这种以农民教育农民的方法，讲者实际，听者亲切，接受得快。农民群众还以说唱、短剧等文艺形式，把科学实验的实践，搬上舞台，反映了农民办科学的时代精神。这样既普及了科学知识，也宣扬了先进人物、先进思想，推动了社会主义农村的文化革命，促进了人们精神面貌的变化，巩固了农村社会主义思想阵地。
    从这几年的工作中，我们逐步体会到：认识来自实践，科学属于人民。少数人垄断科学的时代开始过去，农民群众掌握农业科学的时代已经开始到来。在公社农学组的一次会议上，大家集体创作了一首诗，来歌颂农民在科学上的翻身，诗曰：科学实验开红花，举目尽是土专家，不是博士留学生，我们都是种田家。		南通大变化
    南通变了。
    一九六二年以来，南通公社粮食产量不断增长，社员收入逐年增加。到一九六五年，全社集体粮食总产量比一九六四和一九六一年分别增长百分之二十五点六和百分之一百一十五；亩产平均达到一千一百一十二斤，比一九六四和一九六一年分别增长百分之二十五点一和百分之一百四十八，比公社化前年产量最高的一九五六年，也增长百分之五十左右。在粮食生产不断增长的同时，除柑桔外，其他多种经营也都有了发展。随着生产的发展，社员的生活逐步改善，社会主义集体经济日益巩固。一九六五年集体分配给社员的口粮，比一九六四年增长百分之十七；每个社员平均年收入比一九六四年增长百分之三十三。一九六五年全社支援国家粮食七百三十多万斤，比一九六四年增长百分之二十六左右；公共积累达到四十七万元；储备粮三十六万斤。社员参加集体生产劳动的积极性普遍提高。
    目前，南通公社已初步解决了推广矮秆良种、连作密植、改良磺酸田、防治水稻病虫害和柑桔烂根病、人工孵化家鱼、培植草菇等二十多项生产技术关键。这些都是从群众中来，到群众中去，从当前当地的生产需要出发，为当前当地的生产服务的。
    南通公社在比较短的时间就初步改变了贫穷落后面貌，是由于突出政治，突出毛泽东思想。他们以阶级斗争为纲，以毛泽东思想为统帅，促进了科学实验革命运动的发展；同时，通过科学实验，改变了人们的精神面貌，又反过来推动了阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，巩固了集体经济；对于实现知识分子劳动化、劳动人民知识化，逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，培养革命接班人，都具有深远的影响。
    首先，人们的阶级觉悟提高了。在科学实验的整个过程中，不但存在着先进和落后的斗争，而且存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。阶级敌人和资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，骂我们搞科学实验是“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，更严重的是进行直接的破坏。我们发动群众，进行了坚决的斗争，才使生产和科学实验得到顺利的发展。群众说：“共产党真英明，阶级斗争一抓就灵，科学实验大显神通，农业生产大好收成。”
    第二，干部变了。领导作风深入了，干群关系密切了，官僚主义减少了。过去，我们制订生产计划，心中无数，领导生产常常靠行政办法，催收催种。通过学习毛主席著作，蹲点参加劳动和科学实验，逐步摸索到一些农业生产的客观规律，领导生产心中比较有数，说话比较灵了。目前，不少干部出现了三变（思想、作风、干群关系）、三积极（工作、劳动、科学实验）、三多（知识、办法、劳动）的新气象。
    第三，农民群众变了。在文化水平很低甚至是文盲的农民中，也出现了“科学迷”。瓜山大队老贫农张玉英，用自己的钱和布票购制种子袋，浸种时半夜起床护理。银安大队勤耕生产队三个年近花甲的老农，也搞起“倒种春”不同品种和不同密度的对比试验。泽洋大队生产队长周依六，在水稻抽穗扬花季节，带领儿子跑遍全社寻找变异穗。“吃饭穿衣几十年，没有科学也种田”的老观念，已为“做到老、学到老”，“信鬼神，一事无成，讲科学，年年好收成”所代替。
    第四，知识青年变了。全社共有高小以上的知识青年一千五百多人。他们初回乡时大部分轻视劳动，轻视农民，不安心在农村。阶级敌人也利用青年思想上的弱点，和我们进行着激烈的争夺战。我们抓住这些问题，组织青年学习毛主席著作，组织贫下中农给他们讲“三史”，帮助他们提高了觉悟，自动地揭露阶级敌人的阴谋活动，展开斗争。我们还根据青年的特点，通过组织俱乐部、办夜校和科学实验室，指导他们学习毛主席著作，开展文娱活动，教育他们向老农学习，积极参加生产劳动和科学实验，注意多让他们担任观察记载、测报、考种、土壤速测化验和科普文艺宣传等方面的工作。现在多数青年比较安心，开始养成了劳动习惯，掌握了一定的生产技术，看到了农村有广阔的天地，为红在农村、专在农村打下了较好的思想基础。银安大队一百多个知识青年，现在有一百零九个知识青年当了各种基层组织的骨干，有五十二个知识青年被评为五好社员。大学生潘善治，刚回来时不安心，要他参加劳动，说是“有病”，见人时用斗笠遮着脸，现在能挑一百多斤，学会了一般农活，并且积极带头组织土壤速测，被誉为“田医生”。
    第五，各个部门变了。供销社党支部突出政治，大抓活学活用毛主席著作，在科学实验上做出了较大的贡献。他们积极参加土壤化验，帮助科学实验小组建立土壤档案，根据不同土壤供应不同化肥，辅导科学施肥；他们大力组织供应电石渣、萍母（繁殖红萍用）、甘薯苗等，满足各队生产和科学实验的需要；他们在“愚公移山”精神的激励下，土法上马，经过十三次试验，培植成功了二万多瓶草菇菌种，使一九六五年全社草菇生产由一个大队发展到十五个大队，增加集体收入二万多元，并以菌种支援外地发展草菇生产。人们夸奖说，这个供销社既象研究所，又象技术服务站，把生意也做活了。
    农技站和群众性科学实验密切结合，技术推广工作有了根。他们积极辅导科学实验小组，总结推广群众性科学实验活动成果，提高各小组成员的科学技术水平，工作比过去大大活跃起来了。社办农业中学，也通过参加科学实验，促进了理论和实际的结合，改进了教学，服务了生产。其他如食品公司、搬运站、手工业社、医院、中小学、税务所、银行、粮站等，也都积极配合和参加了科学实验运动。
    全党都投入了三大革命运动，三大革命运动发挥了无比的威力。这使我们更深刻地体会到毛主席所指示的，三大革命运动“是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证”的伟大意义。		几点体会
    几年来，在群众性科学实验运动中，我们边做边学，有以下几点体会。
    一、以阶级斗争为纲，三大革命一齐抓。党委首先要吃透三大革命运动的精神。三大革命运动是一个整体，是互相联系、互相促进的。阶级斗争和两条道路斗争是纲，开展科学实验的革命运动，最重要的是要突出政治，以毛泽东思想武装干部和群众，树立为革命种田，用革命的精神和科学的方法种田的思想。把科学实验切实列入党委的议事日程，在对各部门、各单位部署各项中心工作的同时，对科学实验也提出了任务和要求。在推广先进经验和宣传科学技术时，自始至终要突出政治。
    二、各级干部亲自蹲点搞样板，培养典型，推动全面。我们从一九六二年开始，就分别在桥街、瓜山和八一大队，建立了水稻、绿肥、柑桔等三个样板。由于在蹲点中取得了第一性资料，我们说话就有了力量，推广先进技术也就顺利了。目前，我社粮食、果树、绿肥、畜牧、水产、林业等都有样板，八个公社党委委员都分别蹲点搞样板，培养典型，推动全面。粮食样板桥街大队，原来在全社“倒数第一”，现在成为先进队，连续几年获得高产红旗，并被誉为全社的“技术参谋部”。各个生产大队的干部，也分别在三十二个生产队搞样板，抓点促面。
    三、从实际出发，围攻关键。“党委出题目，小组做文章”，看准了就狠狠抓，抓到底，集中力量围歼。我社种、保、密、改等几项技术关键问题，都是这样解决的。从试验成功到推广往往有一个过程，有许多试验成功的东西，群众还不能完全认识它、掌握它。怎么办？最好的办法还是让事实说话，组织群众来进一步试验，请群众亲自尝尝“梨子”的味道。我们就是这样把试验、示范和推广密切结合起来，从一点到多点，从多点到全面，从样板示范到大面积推广。我们的体会是，干劲要大，步子要稳，打歼灭战要建立在放手发动群众和“一切经过试验”的基础上，才能立于不败之地。
    四、培养骨干。骨干是从阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中涌现出来，通过群众运动的方法培养的。目前，我社树起了二十八名科学实验标兵。在这些标兵中，有“老农头”周依六，“青年头”潘善治，“妇女头”陈幼珠等。以他们为核心，带动全社三百四十多个科学实验中心组成员；再通过后者，带动一千二百多个科学实验小组成员。
    五、开展比学赶帮超，不断革命。要使科学实验持久深入地展开，必须与生产上的比学赶帮超运动拧成一股绳，不断革命，不断前进。二十八个科学实验标兵树起后，我们号召全社广大干部群众，向他们学习。还在各级干部和科学实验小组中，开展了“三查三比”竞赛，即查领导，比组织；查制度，比活动；查计划，比成果。并把科学实验作为评比五好干部的内容之一，季度有小评，年终有总评。一九六五年上半年评比，五十名大队干部中，科学实验搞得较好的有三十六名。
    六、勤俭办科学。贯彻勤俭办科学的原则，是开展群众性科学实验活动中的一个重要问题。实验的项目，要讲究实惠，不图表面，达到产量高，成本低，花工少，收入多；实验的条件，要因陋就简，就地取材，不贪大求洋，做到少花钱，多办事，办好事。目前，我社十六个大队科学实验中心组一般都设置了小型的简易实验室，作为开展群众性科学实验的“技术后方”。实验室里陈列的简易仪器设备，也主要是发扬了自力更生的革命精神，依靠农民群众的双手创造的。
    七、组织一个群众性的科学实验网，作为领导科学实验运动的有力助手和突击力量。科学实验是一项伟大的革命运动，必须由党委统一领导。但还要有一个办事机构，抓日常的具体事务，否则，凡事都由党委来抓，就抓不那么具体。
    几年来，我们在统一抓三大革命、开展群众性科学实验活动中，虽然做了一些工作，但仅仅是开始。在生产方面，我们只是初步改变了贫穷落后的面貌，目前的产量水平还不高，耕作还不够细致。在科学实验方面，发展也不够平衡。群众生产经验的总结还不够。群众性科学技术队伍的培训也抓得不够有力。
    为了进一步搞好科学实验运动，争取第三个五年计划的第一年，在农业生产上有一个全面的好收成，首先要突出政治，把毛主席的书作为我们一切工作的最高指示，把毛主席著作学得更好，把政治空气搞得更浓，并认真地向兄弟单位学习，把我们的科学实验搞得更好。
