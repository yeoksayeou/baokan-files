Title: "Shanghai Spring" Continues Special Performances of "Long Live the Victory of People's War," Vigorously Praising Chairman Mao's Great Thought on People's War, Fiercely Repulsing the So-called "Heterodoxy," Anti-"Bellicosity" and Other Reactionary Fallacies

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 29th. The 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival recently held a series of special performances of "Long Live the Victory of People's War," enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War. This is a powerful counterattack by Shanghai music and dance workers against the bourgeois "authorities" and the modern revisionists' reactionary fallacies of opposing literary and artistic praise for people's war, such as the so-called "heterodoxy" and anti-"bellicosity."

    The musical dances in this special performance reflect the glorious history of the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War, defeating domestic and foreign enemies in the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, as well as the great struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are currently taking up arms against US imperialism and its running dogs. These programs collectively reveal this truth: The unparalleled People's War is the most effective weapon against US imperialism and its running dogs. Revolutionary people all over the world will learn to use People's War to deal with US imperialism and its running dogs. US imperialism, this wild bull running amok everywhere, will eventually be burned to ashes in the flames of People's War that it ignites itself.

    The large-scale dance suite "The Red Army Fears No Expedition Difficulties" once again demonstrates a truth: with Mao Zedong Thought, and with a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary tide can overcome all difficulties and move forward.

    "The Long March is the first of its kind in the historical record, the Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a seed spreader... The Long March ended with our victory and the enemy's defeat." Amidst the solemn recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations and the magnificent music, the seven-part large-scale dance suite "The Red Army Fears No Expedition Difficulties" (excerpts) was unveiled. With its powerful revolutionary momentum and grand scenery, it enthusiastically praised the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's unparalleled revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    The first scene "Farewell," reflecting the Red Army's main force embarking on the expedition, centered on the Red Guards' broadsword dance, depicting the determination of the people in the base areas to persist in the struggle. The second scene is "Breaking Through the Blockade Line." The third scene, "Entering Zunyi," vividly highlights the significant historical moment when the Zunyi Conference of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee in 1935 established Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership in the entire party. The backdrop of the Zunyi Conference site is presented on the backdrop, and on the stage is a dance depicting the army and people eagerly awaiting Chairman Mao's leadership. In the warm and solemn music, Chairman Mao's image and the red flag are reflected on the backdrop. At this time, the choir resounds with a loud song: "Wise leader steers the helm, the revolution advances with great vigor." The actors use jubilant dances to express the enthusiastic scene of soldiers passing the news, the army and people celebrating together, and workers and peasants enthusiastically joining the army, as well as their firm determination to always follow Chairman Mao.

    The fourth, fifth, and sixth scenes of this dance suite, with resolute and powerful musical rhythms and magnificent choruses, take the audience to the Yungui Plateau where "the Hengduan Mountains are difficult to traverse"; to the Dadu River where "the water is turbulent and the mountains are steep"; and to the snowy mountains and grasslands where "the snow is white and the wilderness is vast." The dance portrays the Red Army warriors bravely fighting the enemy, fiercely pursuing and seizing Luding Bridge, and officers and soldiers sharing hardships in the snowy mountains and grasslands, as well as the indomitable revolutionary will of "the wind and rain penetrate clothes, but the bones are harder, and revolutionary ideals are higher than the sky." The tall revolutionary hero image once again shows the audience a truth: with Mao Zedong Thought, and with a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary tide can overcome all difficulties and move forward. The last scene of the dance suite, "The Great Reunion," takes Chairman Mao's poem "The Long March" as its theme, and uses dance and sculpture to summarize the great course of the Long March, depicting the victorious scene of the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army joining forces in the Northwest, "Japanese invaders are frightened, Chiang's soul is lost, and thousands of rivers and mountains sing together."

    This dance suite was created by four young teachers from the Shanghai Dance School who had never done creative work before, based on the same-named suite of songs written by Xiao Hua and composed by Chen Geng and others, and performed by fifty-six students and one teacher. It incorporates the movements of Peking Opera, folk dance, and ethnic minority dance, re-creating them, and is supplemented by accompaniment, recitation, and slide backdrops, which not only has a strong revolutionary combat atmosphere but also has a national style that the masses love to see and hear.

    The symphonic poem "First Battle of Pingxingguan" powerfully embodies the truth that the People's Army does not fight simply by relying on weapons and technology, but more importantly, by relying on politics, by relying on the revolutionary consciousness and courage of commanders and fighters, and by relying on the support of the people.

    The symphonic poem "First Battle of Pingxingguan," which was also performed in the special program, reflects the brilliant victory of our Eighth Route Army under the command of Comrade Lin Biao in annihilating 3,000 Japanese invading troops at Pingxingguan in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Kuomintang army fled without fighting and the people of North China were in dire straits. It enthusiastically praised the invincible power of the People's Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    This symphonic poem was composed by LÃ¼ Qiming and runs through the clear theme of the inevitable victory of the People's War from beginning to end. The music uses the tunes of the then-popular revolutionary songs "The Eighth Route Army March" and "The Army and the People" as the basis and develops them, playing the heroic image of the people's soldiers and showing the magnificent battle scene of the Pingxingguan battle that year. The music also blends the heroic and tenacious combat image of the People's Army with the patriotic feelings of the people who actively support the Eighth Route Army's resistance against Japan. The music powerfully embodies the truth that the People's Army does not fight simply by relying on weapons and technology, but more importantly, by relying on politics, by relying on the proletarian revolutionary consciousness and courage of commanders and fighters, and by relying on the support of the people. This symphony aroused the audience's memories of the fiery struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan, enabling people to more deeply realize that without the People's Army, there would be nothing for the people; if the people want to eliminate the invaders and gain liberation, they must rely on guns.

    The "Ode to Wind and Thunder" suite is a magnificent revolutionary battle march, a paean to "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind."

    The special performance of "Long Live the Victory of People's War" began with the symphonic suite "Ode to Wind and Thunder." The suite uses Chairman Mao's verses, "The four seas are seething, clouds and waters raging, the five continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring," as its theme, depicting the great revolutionary situation in which the world's people's anti-imperialist revolutionary storms are rising and sweeping the globe with the force of thunder. It is a magnificent revolutionary battle march, a paean to "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind," powerfully reflecting the current situation: the revolutionary forces of the world's people far exceed the reactionary forces of imperialism, and the great torrent of the world's people's revolutionary struggle cannot be stopped by any reactionary and decadent force.

    "Ode to Wind and Thunder" consists of six parts: Overture, "Fighting Vietnam," "Storm on Mount Fuji," "African War Drums," "Guerrilla Flames All Over Latin America," and "People of the World Unite and Fight." The music finally played out the heroic spirit of the world's people daring to fight, daring to win, and advancing wave upon wave. It tells people that the lifespan of imperialists will not be very long, and the struggle of the world's people against US imperialism and its running dogs will surely achieve even greater victories, and all demons will be eliminated.

    The special performance also included a male solo of Chairman Mao's poem "The People's Liberation Army Occupies Nanjing," a female solo "Revolutionary Flames Spread All Over Asia, Africa, and Latin America," a flute solo "Militiamen Display Heroic Skills," and a Pipa ballad singing the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation, "Singing Heroes," and so on.

    Music and dance workers regard creating and performing programs praising Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War as their actual actions in participating in the socialist cultural revolution.

    Shanghai music and dance workers regard creating and performing programs praising Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War as their actual actions in participating in the socialist cultural revolution. When the young teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School were creating and rehearsing "The Red Army Fears No Expedition Difficulties" (excerpts), according to the opinions of the school's Party organization, they had to more prominently express the great Mao Zedong Thought, and repeatedly revised and strengthened the dance and music of the "Zunyi Conference" scene. They earnestly studied Chairman Mao's theory on People's War and relevant revolutionary memoirs, and also went to the companies to be soldiers, first performing some of the compiled dances for the soldiers, and modifying them according to the soldiers' opinions. During the performance, when the actors read the report "What are Deng Tuo's Intentions in Tampering with the Engraving 'The East is Red'?" published in the *China Youth Daily*, they felt extremely indignant at Deng Tuo's blatant crimes of wanting to cancel the scenes of the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers cheering to Chairman Mao in front of Zunyi City and Chairman Mao appearing on the Tiananmen Gate Tower at the founding of the People's Republic of China. The actors said: "These demons and monsters like Deng Tuo oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and we must enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought. In the Zunyi Conference scene, when Chairman Mao's huge image appears on the backdrop, we must turn the lights on redder and brighter. Every one of our dance postures must fully reflect the unparalleled love of the people of all nationalities in the country for Chairman Mao."

    How to use foreign symphonic music forms and national dances to praise Chairman Mao's People's War thought? Shanghai music and dance workers have made gratifying attempts in this regard, and have made some breakthroughs and innovations. They are prepared to further process and improve key programs based on the opinions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai believe that the special performance of "Long Live the Victory of People's War" gave everyone a vivid political lesson, enabling everyone to more deeply understand the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and further inspiring the fighting will to struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. They said: A small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs oppose "bellicosity" and attempt to deviate us from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and betray the path of people's revolutionary war. We resolutely oppose this. We must use all literary and artistic forms to praise the great victory of Chairman Mao's People's War thought. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and vigorously support the armed struggles of the people of all countries against US imperialist aggression. (Attached picture)
