    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 29th. The 7th "Shanghai Spring" Music Festival recently held a series of special performances of "Long Live the Victory of People's War," enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War. This is a powerful counterattack by Shanghai music and dance workers against the bourgeois "authorities" and the modern revisionists' reactionary fallacies of opposing literary and artistic praise for people's war, such as the so-called "heterodoxy" and anti-"bellicosity."

    The musical dances in this special performance reflect the glorious history of the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War, defeating domestic and foreign enemies in the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, as well as the great struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are currently taking up arms against US imperialism and its running dogs. These programs collectively reveal this truth: The unparalleled People's War is the most effective weapon against US imperialism and its running dogs. Revolutionary people all over the world will learn to use People's War to deal with US imperialism and its running dogs. US imperialism, this wild bull running amok everywhere, will eventually be burned to ashes in the flames of People's War that it ignites itself.

    The large-scale dance suite "The Red Army Fears No Expedition Difficulties" once again demonstrates a truth: with Mao Zedong Thought, and with a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary tide can overcome all difficulties and move forward.

    "The Long March is the first of its kind in the historical record, the Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a seed spreader... The Long March ended with our victory and the enemy's defeat." Amidst the solemn recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations and the magnificent music, the seven-part large-scale dance suite "The Red Army Fears No Expedition Difficulties" (excerpts) was unveiled. With its powerful revolutionary momentum and grand scenery, it enthusiastically praised the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's unparalleled revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    The first scene "Farewell," reflecting the Red Army's main force embarking on the expedition, centered on the Red Guards' broadsword dance, depicting the determination of the people in the base areas to persist in the struggle. The second scene is "Breaking Through the Blockade Line." The third scene, "Entering Zunyi," vividly highlights the significant historical moment when the Zunyi Conference of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee in 1935 established Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership in the entire party. The backdrop of the Zunyi Conference site is presented on the backdrop, and on the stage is a dance depicting the army and people eagerly awaiting Chairman Mao's leadership. In the warm and solemn music, Chairman Mao's image and the red flag are reflected on the backdrop. At this time, the choir resounds with a loud song: "Wise leader steers the helm, the revolution advances with great vigor." The actors use jubilant dances to express the enthusiastic scene of soldiers passing the news, the army and people celebrating together, and workers and peasants enthusiastically joining the army, as well as their firm determination to always follow Chairman Mao.

    The fourth, fifth, and sixth scenes of this dance suite, with resolute and powerful musical rhythms and magnificent choruses, take the audience to the Yungui Plateau where "the Hengduan Mountains are difficult to traverse"; to the Dadu River where "the water is turbulent and the mountains are steep"; and to the snowy mountains and grasslands where "the snow is white and the wilderness is vast." The dance portrays the Red Army warriors bravely fighting the enemy, fiercely pursuing and seizing Luding Bridge, and officers and soldiers sharing hardships in the snowy mountains and grasslands, as well as the indomitable revolutionary will of "the wind and rain penetrate clothes, but the bones are harder, and revolutionary ideals are higher than the sky." The tall revolutionary hero image once again shows the audience a truth: with Mao Zedong Thought, and with a revolutionary army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary tide can overcome all difficulties and move forward. The last scene of the dance suite, "The Great Reunion," takes Chairman Mao's poem "The Long March" as its theme, and uses dance and sculpture to summarize the great course of the Long March, depicting the victorious scene of the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies of the Red Army joining forces in the Northwest, "Japanese invaders are frightened, Chiang's soul is lost, and thousands of rivers and mountains sing together."

    This dance suite was created by four young teachers from the Shanghai Dance School who had never done creative work before, based on the same-named suite of songs written by Xiao Hua and composed by Chen Geng and others, and performed by fifty-six students and one teacher. It incorporates the movements of Peking Opera, folk dance, and ethnic minority dance, re-creating them, and is supplemented by accompaniment, recitation, and slide backdrops, which not only has a strong revolutionary combat atmosphere but also has a national style that the masses love to see and hear.

    The symphonic poem "First Battle of Pingxingguan" powerfully embodies the truth that the People's Army does not fight simply by relying on weapons and technology, but more importantly, by relying on politics, by relying on the revolutionary consciousness and courage of commanders and fighters, and by relying on the support of the people.

    The symphonic poem "First Battle of Pingxingguan," which was also performed in the special program, reflects the brilliant victory of our Eighth Route Army under the command of Comrade Lin Biao in annihilating 3,000 Japanese invading troops at Pingxingguan in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the Kuomintang army fled without fighting and the people of North China were in dire straits. It enthusiastically praised the invincible power of the People's Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    This symphonic poem was composed by Lü Qiming and runs through the clear theme of the inevitable victory of the People's War from beginning to end. The music uses the tunes of the then-popular revolutionary songs "The Eighth Route Army March" and "The Army and the People" as the basis and develops them, playing the heroic image of the people's soldiers and showing the magnificent battle scene of the Pingxingguan battle that year. The music also blends the heroic and tenacious combat image of the People's Army with the patriotic feelings of the people who actively support the Eighth Route Army's resistance against Japan. The music powerfully embodies the truth that the People's Army does not fight simply by relying on weapons and technology, but more importantly, by relying on politics, by relying on the proletarian revolutionary consciousness and courage of commanders and fighters, and by relying on the support of the people. This symphony aroused the audience's memories of the fiery struggle during the War of Resistance Against Japan, enabling people to more deeply realize that without the People's Army, there would be nothing for the people; if the people want to eliminate the invaders and gain liberation, they must rely on guns.

    The "Ode to Wind and Thunder" suite is a magnificent revolutionary battle march, a paean to "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind."

    The special performance of "Long Live the Victory of People's War" began with the symphonic suite "Ode to Wind and Thunder." The suite uses Chairman Mao's verses, "The four seas are seething, clouds and waters raging, the five continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring," as its theme, depicting the great revolutionary situation in which the world's people's anti-imperialist revolutionary storms are rising and sweeping the globe with the force of thunder. It is a magnificent revolutionary battle march, a paean to "the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind," powerfully reflecting the current situation: the revolutionary forces of the world's people far exceed the reactionary forces of imperialism, and the great torrent of the world's people's revolutionary struggle cannot be stopped by any reactionary and decadent force.

    "Ode to Wind and Thunder" consists of six parts: Overture, "Fighting Vietnam," "Storm on Mount Fuji," "African War Drums," "Guerrilla Flames All Over Latin America," and "People of the World Unite and Fight." The music finally played out the heroic spirit of the world's people daring to fight, daring to win, and advancing wave upon wave. It tells people that the lifespan of imperialists will not be very long, and the struggle of the world's people against US imperialism and its running dogs will surely achieve even greater victories, and all demons will be eliminated.

    The special performance also included a male solo of Chairman Mao's poem "The People's Liberation Army Occupies Nanjing," a female solo "Revolutionary Flames Spread All Over Asia, Africa, and Latin America," a flute solo "Militiamen Display Heroic Skills," and a Pipa ballad singing the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation, "Singing Heroes," and so on.

    Music and dance workers regard creating and performing programs praising Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War as their actual actions in participating in the socialist cultural revolution.

    Shanghai music and dance workers regard creating and performing programs praising Chairman Mao's great thought on People's War as their actual actions in participating in the socialist cultural revolution. When the young teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School were creating and rehearsing "The Red Army Fears No Expedition Difficulties" (excerpts), according to the opinions of the school's Party organization, they had to more prominently express the great Mao Zedong Thought, and repeatedly revised and strengthened the dance and music of the "Zunyi Conference" scene. They earnestly studied Chairman Mao's theory on People's War and relevant revolutionary memoirs, and also went to the companies to be soldiers, first performing some of the compiled dances for the soldiers, and modifying them according to the soldiers' opinions. During the performance, when the actors read the report "What are Deng Tuo's Intentions in Tampering with the Engraving 'The East is Red'?" published in the *China Youth Daily*, they felt extremely indignant at Deng Tuo's blatant crimes of wanting to cancel the scenes of the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers cheering to Chairman Mao in front of Zunyi City and Chairman Mao appearing on the Tiananmen Gate Tower at the founding of the People's Republic of China. The actors said: "These demons and monsters like Deng Tuo oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and we must enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought. In the Zunyi Conference scene, when Chairman Mao's huge image appears on the backdrop, we must turn the lights on redder and brighter. Every one of our dance postures must fully reflect the unparalleled love of the people of all nationalities in the country for Chairman Mao."

    How to use foreign symphonic music forms and national dances to praise Chairman Mao's People's War thought? Shanghai music and dance workers have made gratifying attempts in this regard, and have made some breakthroughs and innovations. They are prepared to further process and improve key programs based on the opinions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai believe that the special performance of "Long Live the Victory of People's War" gave everyone a vivid political lesson, enabling everyone to more deeply understand the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and further inspiring the fighting will to struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. They said: A small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs oppose "bellicosity" and attempt to deviate us from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and betray the path of people's revolutionary war. We resolutely oppose this. We must use all literary and artistic forms to praise the great victory of Chairman Mao's People's War thought. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and vigorously support the armed struggles of the people of all countries against US imperialist aggression. (Attached picture)

    “上海之春”连续举行《人民战争胜利万岁》专场演出
    热烈歌颂毛主席伟大的人民战争思想
    狠狠回击所谓“离经叛道”、反“火药味”等反动谬论
    新华社上海二十九日电　第七届“上海之春”音乐会，最近连续举行《人民战争胜利万岁》专场演出，热烈歌颂毛主席伟大的人民战争思想。这是上海音乐舞蹈工作者对于资产阶级“权威”、现代修正主义者反对文艺歌颂人民战争的所谓“离经叛道”、反“火药味”等反动谬论的有力回击。
    这次专场演出的音乐舞蹈，反映出在毛主席伟大的人民战争思想指导下，我国人民在第二次国内革命战争、抗日战争、解放战争各个时期战胜国内外敌人的光辉史实，以及当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民拿起武器反对美帝国主义及其走狗的伟大斗争。这些节目集中地揭示了这个真理：威力无比的人民战争，是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。全世界革命人民，都将学会用人民战争来对付美帝国主义及其走狗。美帝国主义这只到处乱闯的野牛，终将在它自己点燃起来的人民战争的烈火中被烧成灰烬。
    大型组舞《红军不怕远征难》再次显示出一个真理：有了毛泽东思想，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命队伍，革命浪潮就能排除万难滚滚向前
    “长征是历史纪录上的第一次，长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。……长征是以我们胜利、敌人失败的结果而告结束。”在庄严朗诵毛主席语录和雄壮的乐曲声中，七场大型组舞《红军不怕远征难》（选段）揭幕了。它以磅礴的革命气势，宏伟的图景，热情歌颂了中国工农红军在毛泽东思想指引下，无比的革命英雄气概和革命乐观主义精神。
    反映红军主力踏上征途的第一场“告别”，以赤卫队的大刀舞为中心，刻划了根据地人民坚持斗争的决心。第二场是《突破封锁线》。第三场《进遵义》，鲜明突出地反映了一九三五年党中央政治局“遵义会议”确立毛泽东同志在全党的领导地位的重大历史时刻。天幕上呈现出遵义会议会址的背景，舞台上是军民们急切期待着毛主席来领导的舞蹈塑型。在热烈、庄严的乐声中，天幕上映现出毛主席象和红旗。这时，合唱席响起嘹亮的歌声：“英明领袖来掌舵，革命磅礴向前进。”演员们以欢腾的舞蹈，表现出战士们奔走相告、军民同庆和工农踊跃参军的热烈情景，以及他们永远跟着毛主席走的坚定决心。
    这个组舞的第四、五、六场，以坚毅有力的音乐节奏和雄壮的合唱，把观众带到“横断山、路难行”的云贵高原；“水湍急，山峭耸”的大渡河畔；“雪皑皑、野茫茫”的雪山草地。舞蹈表现了红军健儿踩波踏浪歼敌人、猛追猛打夺泸定、官兵雪山草地同甘苦等英勇盖世的场面，和风雨侵衣骨更硬、革命理想高于天的坚韧不拔的革命意志。高大的革命英雄形象，再一次向观众显示出一个真理：有了毛泽东思想，有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命队伍，革命浪潮就能排除万难滚滚向前。组舞的最后一场《大会师》，以毛主席诗《长征》作主题，用舞蹈、塑型概括了长征的伟大历程，描绘了红军第一、二、四三个方面军会师西北，“日寇胆破蒋魂丧，万水千山齐歌唱”的胜利情景。
    这个组舞是上海市舞蹈学校四个从未进行过创作的青年教师，根据萧华作词、晨耕等作曲的同名组歌创作，由五十六个学生和一个教师演出的。它融汇了京剧、民间舞蹈和少数民族舞蹈的动作，进行了再创造，并辅以伴唱、朗诵和幻灯布景，既有强烈的革命战斗气息，又具有群众喜闻乐见的民族风格。
    交响诗《首战平型关》，有力地体现了人民军队打仗不是单纯地凭武器、技术，更重要的是凭政治，凭指战员的革命觉悟和勇敢精神，凭人民群众的拥护和支持这一真理
    专场演出的交响诗《首战平型关》，反映了抗日战争初期，当国民党军队不战而逃，华北人民陷于水深火热之中的时候，我八路军在林彪同志指挥下在平型关全歼三千日本侵略军的辉煌胜利，热情歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队的战无不胜的威力。
    这首交响诗由吕其明创作，自始至终贯穿着人民战争必胜的鲜明主题。乐曲运用当时流行的《八路军军歌》和《军队和老百姓》两首革命歌曲的音调作为基础并加以发展，奏出了人民子弟兵的英雄形象，展现了当年平型关战役的宏伟的战斗场面。乐曲还把人民军队英勇顽强的战斗形象同人民爱国、积极支持八路军抗日的情感揉和在一起。乐曲有力地体现了人民军队打仗不是单纯地凭武器、技术，更重要的是凭政治，凭指战员的无产阶级革命觉悟和勇敢精神，凭人民群众的拥护和支持这一真理。这首交响乐激起了听众对抗日时期战火纷飞的斗争生活的回忆，使人们更深刻地认识到：没有人民的军队，便没有人民的一切；人民要消灭侵略者，得到解放，必须靠枪杆子。
    《风雷颂》组曲，是一首波澜壮阔的革命的战斗进行曲，是一首“东风压倒西风”的颂歌
    《人民战争胜利万岁》专场演出，是以交响组曲《风雷颂》开始的。组曲用毛主席的诗句：“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”作为主题，描绘了世界人民反帝革命风暴风起云涌，正以雷霆万钧之势席卷全球的一派大好革命形势。它是一首波澜壮阔的革命的战斗进行曲，是一首“东风压倒西风”的颂歌，有力地反映出当前的形势：世界人民的革命力量远远超过了帝国主义的反动力量，世界人民革命斗争的巨大洪流，是任何反动腐朽的力量阻挡不住的。
    《风雷颂》由序曲、《战斗的越南》、《富士山的风暴》、《非洲战鼓》、《游击烽火遍拉美》、《全世界人民团结战斗》六个部分组成。乐曲最后奏出了世界人民敢于斗争，敢于胜利，前赴后继的英雄气概。它告诉人们：帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利，一切魔鬼统统都要被消灭。
    在这个专场演出的，还有男声独唱毛主席诗《人民解放军占领南京》、女声独唱《革命烈火燃遍亚非拉》、笛子独奏《民兵逞英豪》，和歌颂越南人民抗美救国斗争英雄事迹的琵琶弹唱《唱英雄》等。
    音乐舞蹈工作者把创作排演歌颂毛主席伟大人民战争思想的节目，看做是自己参加社会主义文化大革命的实际行动
    上海音乐舞蹈工作者把创作排演歌颂毛主席伟大人民战争思想的节目，看做是自己参加社会主义文化大革命的实际行动。上海市舞蹈学校青年师生在创作和排练《红军不怕远征难》（选段）时，根据学校党组织的意见，一定要更突出地表现伟大的毛泽东思想，曾反复修改和加强《遵义会议》一场的舞蹈和音乐。他们认真学习了毛主席关于人民战争的理论和有关的革命回忆录，并且到连队当兵，把编好的一些舞蹈先演给战士看，根据战士的意见加以修改。演出过程中，当演员们读到《中国青年报》刊登的《邓拓篡改雕刻〈东方红〉居心何在？》的报道时，对邓拓明目张胆地要取消广大工农兵在遵义城前向毛主席欢呼和中华人民共和国成立时毛主席出现在天安门城楼等画面的罪行，感到万分愤慨。演员们说：“邓拓这些牛鬼蛇神反对毛泽东思想，我们就是要热烈歌颂毛泽东思想。遵义会议这一场，当毛主席的巨象在天幕上出现时，一定要把灯光开得更红、更亮。我们每一个舞姿都要充分体现全国各族人民对毛主席的无比热爱。”
    怎样利用外来的交响音乐形式和民族舞蹈来歌颂毛主席人民战争思想？上海音乐舞蹈工作者在这方面作了可喜的尝试，并有所突破和创新。他们准备根据工农兵的意见，进一步加工提高重点节目。上海广大工农兵观众认为，《人民战争胜利万岁》专场演出，给大家上了一堂生动的政治课，使大家更深刻地领会了毛主席所指出的：“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，进一步鼓舞了同帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争的战斗意志。他们说：一小撮反党反社会主义的黑帮反对“火药味”，妄图使我们离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之经，叛人民革命战争之道，我们坚决反对。我们就是要用一切文艺形式颂扬毛主席人民战争思想的伟大胜利。我们就是要遵照毛主席的教导，大力支持世界各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的武装斗争。（附图片）
