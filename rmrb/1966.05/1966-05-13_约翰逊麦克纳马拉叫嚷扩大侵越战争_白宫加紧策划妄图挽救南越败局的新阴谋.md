    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th -- Washington news: U.S. President Johnson and Defense Secretary McNamara on the 11th clamored for strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam in order to save the U.S. from defeat there.
    In a speech at Princeton University in New Jersey, Johnson tried his best to defend the U.S. government's policy of continuously expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. He clamored that the United States could not "ignore the misfortunes of the cause of freedom" in Southeast Asia and that the United States would "use force" to pursue its aggressive goals. He also said that Americans must "recognize that there are still enemies that must be confronted" and that "the most ruthless challenge is in Southeast Asia."
    McNamara said bluntly during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States would "continue to intensify its involvement" in South Vietnam. He said, "We are prepared, militarily prepared, to fulfill our political obligations." He also announced that if "new emergencies" occurred during the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. government would call up military reservists for active duty.
    Johnson and McNamara made these remarks at a time when the U.S. "Ambassador" to South Vietnam, Lodge, had returned to Washington to discuss expanding the war of aggression with the U.S. government. Johnson had already held a National Security Council meeting on the 10th to hear Lodge's report on the Vietnam issue. At this meeting, McNamara and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler gave estimates of the military situation in South Vietnam, and Secretary of State Rusk made a statement on political issues.
    According to U.S. news agencies, in order to discuss steps to expand aggression, Johnson and senior U.S. government officials will "conduct a week of intensive study."

    约翰逊麦克纳马拉叫嚷扩大侵越战争
    白宫加紧策划妄图挽救南越败局的新阴谋
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊和国防部长麦克纳马拉十一日鼓吹强化和扩大侵越战争，以挽救美国在那里的败局。
    约翰逊在新泽西州普林斯顿大学发表演说时竭力为美国政府不断扩大侵越战争的政策辩护。他叫嚷，美国不能把东南亚的“自由事业的不幸遭遇置之度外”，美国要“使用力量”来追求它的侵略目标。他还说，美国人必须“认识到现在仍旧存在着必须对付其挑战的敌人”，而“最冷酷的挑战是在东南亚”。
    麦克纳马拉在参议院外交委员会会议上作证时露骨地说，美国要在南越“继续加紧干”。他说，“我们已经作好了准备，在军事上作好了准备，以履行我们的政治义务。”他还宣布，如果美国在进行侵越战争时发生“新的紧急事件”，美国政府将要征召军事后备役人员服现役。
    约翰逊和麦克纳马拉是在美国驻南越“大使”洛奇回到华盛顿同美国政府商讨扩大侵越战争的时候发表谈话的。约翰逊已经在十日举行国家安全委员会会议，听取洛奇关于越南问题的报告。在这个会议上，麦克纳马拉和参谋长联席会议主席惠勒作了关于南越军事形势的估计，国务卿腊斯克作了关于政治问题的发言。
    据美国通讯社报道，为了磋商扩大侵略的步骤，约翰逊和美国政府的高级官员将“进行一个星期的集中研究的工作”。
