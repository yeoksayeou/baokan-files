    Critique of the Bourgeois Standpoint of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily"
    Qi Benyu
    On April 16th of this year, "Beijing Daily" published "criticism" materials about "Three-Family Village" and "Evening Talks at Yanshan" in a special three-page spread with a banner headline in bold type. The "Editor's Note" for this material was added by the "Frontline" magazine and "Beijing Daily" of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. "Beijing Evening News," published on the same day, also selected and published these materials in three pages. The momentum was unprecedented since the founding of these newspapers and magazines.
    "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" have published a large number of anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous weeds in the past. If they can seriously criticize these poisonous weeds and conduct a serious self-criticism of their mistakes, it is necessary and should be done. However, is the current practice of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" seriously criticizing poisonous weeds? Are they seriously conducting self-criticism? No, they are not.
    Have you criticized Wu Han?
    No.
    From 1959, when Wu Han launched a frantic attack on the Party and socialism with the theme of Hai Rui, to November 10, 1965, when Comrade Yao Wenyuan published "Critique of the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," there were more than six years. During these six years, "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" did not expose a single word about Wu Han. On the contrary, "Beijing Daily" and "Beijing Evening News" actively published articles during this period to warmly support Wu Han and the anti-Party, anti-socialist "Hai Rui" he created. The "Old Brother, Young Brother" group's wonderful "fine blowing and subtle hitting" articles were the most outrageous and worst of all the articles praising "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    After Comrade Yao Wenyuan raised the issue of Wu Han, did you change your attitude? No, you did not. For nearly twenty days, you neither reprinted nor introduced such an important fighting article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan. Instead, you questioned the comrades in Shanghai: "What is the background for your publication of Yao Wenyuan's article? Why didn't you give us prior notice? Where is your Party spirit?"
    What background? The background is the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the background is Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on classes and class contradictions in socialist society, and the background is the decision in the Communiqué of the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, which you also published in your newspapers, to carry out a class struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology throughout the country. Does carrying out class struggle require your approval? Does not having your approval mean a lack of Party spirit? It seems very clear that the Party spirit you want is not the Party spirit of the proletariat, but the Party spirit of the bourgeoisie.
    On November 29, 1965, "Beijing Daily" was forced to reprint Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article under the pressure of the masses. Did your attitude change at this time? No. "Liberation Army Daily" published a clear-cut "Editor's Note" that correctly pointed out that Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was a big poisonous weed. The "Editor's Note" of "Beijing Daily," however, neither affirmed nor denied "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." It only said that it was a "play with considerable influence," and that in recent years, everyone had "different opinions," and that "different opinions should be discussed." In fact, you supported Wu Han and opposed Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article. "Frontline" and "Beijing Evening News" did not reprint Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article. "Beijing Daily" came out to reprint it, pretending to be fair to cover up your true biased attitude.
    On December 12, 1965, "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" suddenly published an article by Xiang Yangsheng in a prominent position with an eye-catching headline. The title was "From 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' to 'Theory of Moral Inheritance'." It seemed that you had corrected your mistakes and stood on the front line of the socialist cultural revolution.
    What was going on?
    It turned out that this was an article that sang a tune opposite to the cultural revolution. This article was using the technique of "small criticism for big help" to protect Wu Han. The central idea of ​​the article was to describe the "guiding ideology" of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" as a question of "moral inheritance." A major anti-Party, anti-socialist political issue was turned into a so-called "pure academic" issue in Xiang Yangsheng's article.
    The author of the article also used the bourgeois slogan of "everyone is equal before the truth" to defend Wu Han. In fact, you have always stood on the bourgeois position, shielding bourgeois representatives like Wu Han and suppressing proletarian revolutionaries. You have always given the green light to reactionary things, allowing a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds to be published, while suppressing articles criticizing poisonous weeds, not allowing them to be published. This is unadulterated bourgeois "liberalization" and unadulterated dictatorship over the proletariat. Where is the equality?
    At the end of Xiang Yangsheng's article, he pretended to ask everyone to discuss the so-called "moral inheritance" issue, trying to set the tone for the discussion of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" issue, and wanted to shift the criticism of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" from a sharp political issue to a so-called "pure academic" issue. Later, people learned that the so-called Xiang Yangsheng was Deng Tuo, who co-wrote anti-Party articles with Wu Han. More seriously, on December 2, 1965, Deng Tuo publicly announced at a meeting of "Beijing Daily" that "it has not been confirmed that 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' is a big poisonous weed," and said that Yao Wenyuan's article also had mistakes like Wu Han's article.
    Not long after, on December 27, 1965, "Beijing Daily" published Wu Han's "Self-Criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," which was a false self-criticism and a true attack. When "Beijing Daily" published this article, it did not add any editor's note or make any criticism, which actually supported Wu Han in launching a counterattack against the comrades who criticized him in the form of a self-criticism. It is worth noting that in this article, Wu Han tacitly told Xiang Yangsheng that your criticism "made me realize my mistakes and correct my views." After Wu Han completed the counterattack mission, he followed the tone set by Xiang Yangsheng and published a so-called self-criticism on the issue of "moral inheritance" in "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily," gladly admitting that the "center" of his mistakes was the so-called "moral inheritance" issue. The two people worked closely together, singing in harmony and acting out a double act.
    One article was not enough, and the tone could not be set. You then successively published articles of a similar nature, trying to pull Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist political issue onto the so-called "pure academic" issue. Li Dongshi's (i.e., Li Qi, head of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee) article "On Comrade Wu Han's View of History," published in "Beijing Daily" on January 8 this year, was thrown out for this purpose. This article described the "guiding" ideology of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" as a view of evaluating historical figures. The same "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was sometimes the product of the so-called "theory of moral inheritance," and sometimes a product of a certain view of evaluating historical figures. You just refused to say that it was a product of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiments.
    With everyone watching, it is impossible to engage in private interests. The tactics of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" of falsely exposing and truly supporting, falsely criticizing and truly shielding, and falsely struggling and truly protecting Wu Han were quickly recognized by everyone. Many newspapers and magazines published articles exposing Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Especially since April this year, Wu Han's crimes of being anti-Party and anti-socialist have become increasingly recognized by people. The face of an anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary intellectual has become increasingly clear. An embarrassing "checkmate" situation was placed in front of "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," which supported and shielded Wu Han. Therefore, you reluctantly came out and said, "Wu Han is the author of the two big poisonous weeds, 'Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor' and 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," and re-published Wu Han's past article "Zhao Kuo and Ma Su" in "Frontline," wanting to perfunctorily deal with the matter and deceive readers. This is your so-called "criticism" of Wu Han. People cannot help but ask, why do you introduce things that everyone knows as important secrets, but you refuse to mention a single word about Wu Han's loyal inheritance of Hu Shi's mantle, his willingness to serve as an American comprador, and his various criminal activities of plotting for the Kuomintang reactionaries?
    Have you criticized Liao Mosha?
    No.
    Liao Mosha (former head of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee) was the person who "changed the name and hung it on a hidden arrow" ① to attack Lu Xun, the main general of the cultural revolution. Now he uses the same method to shoot hidden arrows at the Party and the people. May I ask "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News": When have you ever criticized such a person?
    Rotten poisonous weeds are described by Liao Mosha as bright flowers. The anti-Party, anti-socialist "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is very good, "write another one"; the anti-Party, anti-socialist "Li Huiniang" is "harmless even with ghosts," "can inspire people's fighting spirit." When have you criticized these works that advocate for the right-leaning opportunist, i.e., revisionist, trends, create waves, and spread a large number of toxins in society?
    You clearly know that the publication of "Stories of Not Being Afraid of Ghosts" is to encourage the Chinese people to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, but you insist on singing a counter-tune and publishing Liao Mosha's "Afraid of Ghosts 'Elegant Humor'" in "Frontline," maliciously attacking the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, slandering our great Party and great people as "despicable and stupid," "making empty talk," "only considering the front and not the back," and "people who claim not to be afraid of ghosts but are actually afraid of ghosts to death." May I ask what you want to do by publishing such articles? When have the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people ever been afraid of ghosts? Isn't your humiliation of the great Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people exactly the same as that of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries?
    On May 6, 1963, Comrade Liang Bihui (i.e., Yu Minghuang) published an article in "Wenhui Daily" criticizing Liao Mosha's "Theory of No Harm in Ghosts." Other newspapers and magazines then launched criticisms, but you still refused to publish articles criticizing him at this time. You dragged on until later, when you really couldn't account for it, and then you were forced to help Liao Mosha publish a disguised and deceptive self-criticism: "My 'Theory of No Harm in Ghosts' is Wrong." What "forgotten" about "class struggle," what "lost vigilance," what "unclear boundaries," what "lost" "direction," what "unconsciously helped the bourgeoisie and feudal forces to launch a frantic attack on the Party and socialism," and put a pile of relaxed hats on yourself as if it were a serious matter.
    Of course, such a false self-criticism cannot fool the masses. Readers seriously criticized this false self-criticism, but neither "Frontline" nor "Beijing Daily" or "Beijing Evening News" paid attention to this legitimate criticism from the masses. Because for you, Liao Mosha must be well protected. This anti-Party and anti-socialist position must not be conceded.
    On April 16th of this year, the "Editor's Note" of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" seemed to have changed their past tone, saying: "He (referring to Liao Mosha) is by no means 'unconsciously helping the bourgeoisie and feudal forces to launch a frantic attack on the Party and socialism,' but a member of the main force who consciously opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought." However, this is still an empty hat. We want to ask what exactly is this Liao Mosha doing? From his series of reactionary words and deeds, it can be seen that he is a bourgeois representative who has infiltrated the Party, he is a bourgeois representative who speaks for "ghosts," speaks for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and speaks for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. He is a bourgeois representative who has formed an anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary united front with foreign devils and local devils. You know much more about his reactionary activities than we do. Why don't you expose a little bit? It seems that you are still confused by "ghosts" until now.
    Have you criticized Deng Tuo?
    No.
    A few years ago, right-leaning opportunists, i.e., revisionists, representing the forces of capitalist restoration, set off a countercurrent in the surging tide of socialist revolution. They took advantage of our temporary difficulties and frantically launched attacks on the Party and socialism. Deng Tuo was an important figure in this frantic attack. Deng Tuo was the organizer and leader of the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party clique, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and Deng Tuo. We know that it was this Deng Tuo who personally took the lead in September 1961, gathering Wu Han and Liao Mosha for a dinner in a hotel to organize this anti-Party and anti-socialist black shop. He came up with the name of the black shop, he decided on Wu Nanxing's pseudonym, and he approved whether or not the articles were published. The history of the opening of "Three-Family Village" is the history of Deng Tuo leading Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and a group of anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois representatives in carrying out a sharp class struggle with the proletariat on the cultural and ideological front.
    What kind of person is Deng Tuo? It has now been verified that he is a traitor. He infiltrated the Party again during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He pretended to be active and won the trust of the Party and the people, and served in an important position in "People's Daily." He often used his position to distort Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and promoted and publicized his bourgeois revisionist ideas. In the summer of 1957, he was a feather-shaking figure on the side of the bourgeois rightists. He published many anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist remarks. "People's Daily" published an article under the pseudonym Bu Wuji "Abolish 'Mediocre Politics'" on May 11, 1957, which he wrote. This article viciously attacked the Party and wanted the Party to hand over leadership to the bourgeois rightists. In addition, he actively supported the rightists in launching frantic attacks on the Party. The extreme rightist Lin Xiling was his closest friend. Lin Xiling once called him a Chinese "unorthodox Marxist." That is to say, even the bourgeois rightists had long known that he was a revisionist. With the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, Deng Tuo's dream of capitalist restoration failed. His position in "People's Daily" was revoked by the Party Central Committee. He was "dismissed" by the people. Shortly after this, he sneaked into the Beijing Municipal Committee again, returned to the stage, and became the Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Committee.
    Deng Tuo "understood" some strategies of struggle. The stormy waves of the anti-rightist movement in 1957 made him change his way of fighting. The scene of the rightists being criticized and struggled by the broad masses in the anti-rightist movement made him feel lingering fear. Under the new situation of class struggle, he no longer went into battle bare-chested like he did in 1957 when he published rightist remarks, but adopted a more insidious and cunning method to fight us. Relying on positions like "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," he used the method of borrowing from the past to satirize the present and pointing at the mulberry to scold the locust, continuously sending one poisonous arrow after another to the Party and socialism. "An Egg's Fortune," "The Story of Exaggeration," "Two Foreign Fables," "Three Kinds of Zhuge Liang," "'Great Empty Talk'," "'Putting Down Is Reality'," "The Theory of Protecting Labor," "The Way of Making Friends and Treating Guests," "The Case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng," "Defending Li Sancai," "Kunlun Mountain People," "Wanping Big and Small Rice," "Zheng Banqiao and 'Banqiao Style'," "Is Wisdom Reliable?," "Kingly Way and Hegemony," "After-the-Fact Cannon," "Ancient Cartoons," "The Death of Lin Baishui," "Specializing in Treating 'Amnesia'," etc., are the worst among them.
    Have "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" ever criticized all these poisonous weeds that viciously attacked the Party and socialism using the techniques of borrowing from the past to satirize the present and pointing at the mulberry to scold the locust? No, not a single bit.
    Especially that extremely reactionary "Specializing in Treating 'Amnesia'," this is a very vicious arrow, its spearhead directly aimed at our beloved Party Central Committee. He unscrupulously attacks our beloved Party. He wants to use "dog blood" to shower our "heads," and use foreign-made sticks to hit our "heads" until we are in "shock," so that those so-called "brilliant doctors," i.e., a small handful of revisionists, can come to power. This crazy anti-revolutionary miscellaneous essay fully exposes the black heart of Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist revisionists, who hate the Party and the people to the bone.
    Deng Tuo's rampant anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior aroused the indignation of the broad masses of readers, who wrote letters to "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" to make serious criticisms. However, you did not publish such criticism letters. Not only did you not publish them, but you also tried every means to defend Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes. What you said was "a hundred schools of thought contend," but what you actually did was bourgeois "one family contend." That is to say, you are only allowed to oppose the Party and socialism and release capitalist poison, and the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres are not allowed to defend the Party and defend socialism and eradicate your poisonous weeds. What you are implementing is completely bourgeois dictatorship and bourgeois autocracy.
    In November 1965, the situation on the socialist cultural revolution front changed drastically. A new counterattack began, and Deng Tuo's collaborator Wu Han was exposed. If "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" were truly willing to expose Deng Tuo, you still had some initiative at this time, but you did not do so. Not only did you not do so, but you also asked Deng Tuo to give reports and write articles to support and shield Wu Han.
    Objective class struggle is independent of people's subjective will. The struggle continued to deepen. The joint anti-Party and anti-socialist face of Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and Deng Tuo became completely clear. The broad masses of readers were extremely dissatisfied with the practice of "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" of shielding Deng Tuo and suppressing criticism, and were indignant. The lid had to be lifted. At this time, in order to get rid of the passive situation of being attacked, and more importantly, to better protect Deng Tuo and others, you hurriedly raised the issue of Deng Tuo.
    Isn't the statement that the purpose of raising the issue of Deng Tuo is to better protect Deng Tuo and others self-contradictory? No, it is not contradictory.
    More than three months ago, didn't "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" actively publish Xiang Yangsheng's article "criticizing" Wu Han in order to protect Wu Han? Raising the issue of Deng Tuo is just a re-enactment of this ugly drama of false exposure and true support, false criticism and true shielding, and false struggle and true protection.
    In the "Editor's Note," "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" tried their best to avoid the issue of Deng Tuo's attack on the Party and socialism. Deng Tuo, one of the most important figures in "Three-Family Village," occupied the least important position in the "Editor's Note" of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily." Wu Han was "attacking the Party and socialism," Liao Mosha was the "main force" against the Party and socialism, but Deng Tuo was not against the Party and socialism. Inverting the importance, covering up the key points, sacrificing the pawns to save the generals, this is the set of tactics that "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" played in protecting Deng Tuo.
    The materials published by "Beijing Daily" on "criticizing" Deng Tuo also did not mention the issue of Deng Tuo's attack on the Party and socialism. The "abstracts of Evening Talks at Yanshan" that occupied two pages only mentioned Deng Tuo's "satirizing the present with the past" problem at the end with two bland and inconspicuous subheadings. Deng Tuo's reactionary remarks that maliciously attacked the Party, attacked the general line, attacked the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and those articles that defended the right-leaning opportunists, i.e., revisionists, who were dismissed from office and demoted, were also written to defend his own dismissal and demotion, were all lightly described by "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" as "vulgar and boring," "self-admiring," and at most "beautifying the feudal social system" and promoting bourgeois ideology.
    On April 19th of this year, "Beijing Daily" also distributed a copy of "Reference Topics on Criticizing 'Evening Talks at Yanshan'," saying that "Deng Tuo is a revivalist in art," "standing on the tower of the ancients," "promoting that the older the art, the better," continuing to provide cover for Deng Tuo, trying to guide readers to focus the criticism of Deng Tuo on the direction of "worshiping the ancients and learning from the ancients."
    The political key issue of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and preparing public opinion for capitalist restoration is gone.
    Can this be called "criticism"? Isn't it more in line with reality to call it covering up mistakes, shielding bad people, and deceiving readers?
    The "Editor's Note" of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" said: "In this struggle, the lessons we have learned are very profound. In the past, because we relaxed the class struggle on the cultural and academic front, we allowed bourgeois representatives inside and outside the Party to take advantage of the situation, use academic articles, essays, and other forms to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, and use newspaper columns to open up their 'free markets'.... This magazine and this newspaper published these articles in the past without criticizing them in time, which is wrong. The reason is that we did not implement proletarian politics in command, and our minds were influenced by bourgeois and feudal class ideas, so that we lost our position or lost our vigilance in this serious struggle."
    Can this be called self-criticism?
    "The lessons are very profound." What lessons?
    "Relaxing the class struggle on the cultural and academic front." Was it really relaxed?
    "Allowing bourgeois representatives inside and outside the Party to take advantage of the situation, use academic articles, essays, and other forms to oppose the Party and oppose socialism." Were you really taken advantage of by others? Were you really used by others?
    "The reason is that we did not implement proletarian politics in command." If proletarian politics was not in command, then which class's politics was in command?
    "Our minds were influenced by bourgeois and feudal class ideas." Was there only a little influence from bourgeois and feudal class ideas?
    "So that we lost our position or lost our vigilance in this serious struggle." Did you lose your position? Did you lose your vigilance?
    All are not true.
    "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and that "Beijing Evening News," for a considerable period of time in recent years, were themselves tools for Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others to frantically attack the Party and socialism, rather than the problem of being "used" by others unconsciously. Your position is not the position of the proletariat, but the position of the bourgeoisie. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others were originally sitting safely in the gates of the Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, acting as officials and masters, issuing orders, faithfully implementing the revisionist line, and attempting to realize the dream of capitalist restoration through "peaceful evolution," and there was no question of being "taken advantage of by bourgeois representatives." You are opposing the red flag while waving the "red flag," opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought while wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. You are shouting the slogans of proletarian dictatorship and socialism to uglify proletarian dictatorship and uglify the socialist system. You are hanging up the signboard of the Communist Party and stealing the name of the Party newspaper and Party magazine to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. At the moment of the serious struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism in our country, you have always stood on the bourgeois position and intensified the sharp class struggle with the proletariat, and it is by no means a relaxation of class struggle. You do not have proletarian politics in command, but you have bourgeois politics in command. Your bourgeois reactionary ideas are very stubborn, your bourgeois reactionary position is very firm, your bourgeois reactionary sense of smell is very sensitive, and your bourgeois Party spirit is very strong. Until recently, you were still waving axes, chopping off all the key issues in other people's articles criticizing Deng Tuo, saying that "this cannot be linked," "that cannot be established," "no matter how others do it, we will still do it as an academic discussion." How is this just a little influence from bourgeois and feudal class ideas, or a loss of position or loss of vigilance?
    Fake is fake, and disguise should be stripped away. Applying rouge and powder cannot cover up an ugly face. You have released so much poison in the past, let out so many monsters and demons, and played so many bad tricks to resist the cultural revolution. Can you explain the past to readers with a few empty words today?
     It is time for "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" to be thoroughly revolutionized. When domestic and foreign class enemies were stirring up black winds, who actively supported Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha in carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities? After the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha were countered by the revolutionary masses, who used various methods to shield Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha? Later, when the problems of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha could not be covered up, who instructed you to play that set of false criticism tricks of "sacrificing the pawns to save the generals"? You cannot cover up all these problems, and you cannot avoid them. Concealment cannot last. The eyes of the masses are sharp. If you do not expose them, the masses will expose them. If you do not criticize them, the masses will criticize them. We believe that all comrades in the editorial departments of "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" who are willing to make revolution will be able to bravely stand up, raise the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly break with the bourgeois representatives, and boldly expose and criticize your criminal facts of opposing the Party and opposing socialism.
    The organized, planned, and led anti-Party incidents of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others should arouse our high vigilance. The powerful socialist revolutionary forces have overthrown batches of bourgeois representatives, but this does not mean that everything is fine. We should see that some bourgeois representatives will continue to come on stage to perform. The difference is that their performance methods will often change, some are naked, some are more concealed, sometimes they attack separately, and sometimes they attack collectively. We must actively participate in the current movement, resolutely launch struggles against all kinds of bourgeois representatives, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.
    The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. All monsters and demons that have come out, have not come out, are on stage, and are off stage are vulnerable in the face of such great power. The moribund capitalist system is facing a tragic fate like the autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. How can a small handful of insignificant ants shake the towering tree of socialism?
  Note ①　Liao Mosha once used the pseudonym "Lin Mo" in 1934 to publish an article "On 'Gossip Literature'" in "Da Wan Bao," attacking Lu Xun's revolutionary essays as "gossip literature." Lu Xun returned this sentence to Liao Mosha and named his collection of essays "Gossip Literature." See "Complete Works of Lu Xun," Volume 5, People's Literature Publishing House, 1957 edition, pages 341, 397-400.

    评《前线》《北京日报》的资产阶级立场

    今年四月十六日，《北京日报》以三个版的特大篇幅和通栏的黑体大字标题，刊登了关于“三家村”和《燕山夜话》的“批判”资料。中共北京市委《前线》杂志和《北京日报》，为这个资料加上了“编者按”。当天出版的《北京晚报》，也以三个多版的篇幅选登了这些资料。声势之大，是这几个报刊创办以来所罕见的。
    《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，过去发表了大量的反党、反社会主义毒草，现在如果能对这许多毒草进行认真的批判，并且对自己的错误进行严肃的自我批评，这是必要的，也是应该的。但是，《前线》《北京日报》现在的这种作法，是不是在认真地批判毒草呢？是不是在严肃地进行自我批评呢？不，不是。
    你们批判过吴晗吗？
    没有。
    从一九五九年吴晗以海瑞为题，向党、向社会主义发动猖狂进攻以来，到一九六五年十一月十日姚文元同志发表《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》，时间共有六年多。在这六年多时间里，《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，没有揭露过吴晗一个字。相反地，《北京日报》《北京晚报》却在这个期间积极发表文章，为吴晗，为吴晗所塑造的反党、反社会主义的“海瑞”热烈捧场。“老兄老弟”们那一组“细吹细打”的妙文，在所有吹捧《海瑞罢官》的文章中，是最不象样子，最恶劣的。
    姚文元同志提出吴晗的问题以后，你们是否改变了自己的态度呢？也没有。在差不多二十天的时间里，你们对姚文元同志这样一篇重要的战斗文章，不转载，不介绍，反而质问上海的同志：“你们发表姚文元的文章有什么背景？为什么不事先打招呼？你们的党性到哪里去了？”
    什么背景？背景就是无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争，背景就是毛泽东同志经常教导我们的关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级矛盾的学说，背景就是你们报纸上也登载过的党的八届十中全会公报中关于在全国开展兴无灭资阶级斗争的决定。难道进行阶级斗争，还要经过你们批准吗？难道不经过你们批准，就是没有党性吗？看来很清楚，你们所要的党性不是无产阶级的党性，而是资产阶级的党性。
    一九六五年十一月二十九日，《北京日报》在群众的压力下被迫转载了姚文元同志的文章。这时，你们的态度转变了吗？也没有。《解放军报》发表了旗帜鲜明的“编者按”，正确地指出，吴晗的《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草。而《北京日报》的“编者按”，对《海瑞罢官》却既不讲是，又不讲非，只是说，这是一出“影响较大的戏”，几年来，大家是“有不同意见的”，“有不同的意见应该展开讨论”。其实，你们是支持吴晗，反对姚文元同志文章的。《前线》《北京晚报》都不转载姚文元同志的文章，《北京日报》出来转载一下，这是装出一副假公正的面孔，来掩盖你们真偏袒的态度。
    一九六五年十二月十二日，《前线》《北京日报》突然以显著的地位、醒目的标题，发表了署名向阳生的文章，题目是《从〈海瑞罢官〉谈到“道德继承论”》。好象你们改正了自己的错误，站到社会主义文化革命的前线上了。
    这是怎么一回事呢？
    原来这是一篇同文化革命唱反调的文章。这篇文章是在用“小骂大帮忙”的手法，为吴晗保驾。文章的中心意思，是要把吴晗《海瑞罢官》的“指导思想”说成是一种“道德继承”问题。一个反党、反社会主义的重大政治问题，在向阳生的文章里，变成了一个所谓“纯学术”问题。
    文章的作者还打着“在真理面前人人平等”的资产阶级口号，来为吴晗辩护。其实，你们从来是站在资产阶级的立场上，包庇吴晗之类的资产阶级代表人物，压制无产阶级革命者。你们对于反动的东西，一直是开放绿灯，让反党、反社会主义的毒草大量出笼，而对于批判毒草的文章却一概扣压起来，不准发表，这是不折不扣的资产阶级“自由化”，不折不扣的对无产阶级实行专政，哪里是什么平等呢？
    向阳生文章的末尾还装腔作势地要求大家对所谓“道德继承”问题，进行讨论，企图为吴晗《海瑞罢官》问题的讨论定调子，想把对吴晗《海瑞罢官》的批判，从尖锐的政治问题转到所谓“纯学术”问题上去。后来人们知道，所谓向阳生者，也就是同吴晗合写反党文章的邓拓。更为严重的是，一九六五年十二月二日邓拓还在《北京日报》一次会议上公开宣布“现在并没有肯定《海瑞罢官》是株大毒草”，并且说姚文元同志的文章同吴晗的文章一样也有错误。
    隔了不久，即一九六五年的十二月二十七日，《北京日报》发表了吴晗的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》，这是一篇假检讨、真进攻的文章。《北京日报》在发表这篇文章的时候，不加任何按语，不作任何批判，这实际上是支持吴晗以检讨的形式向批评他的同志进行反攻。值得注意的是，在这篇文章里，吴晗就心照不宣地对向阳生说，你的批评“使我认识了错误，改正了自己的观点”。吴晗完成了反攻任务以后，就按照向阳生定的调子，在《前线》《北京日报》上发表了关于“道德继承”问题的所谓自我批评，欣然承认自己错误的“中心”，是所谓“道德继承”问题。两个人密切搭配，一唱一和，演了一场双簧。
    一篇不够，调子定不下来。你们又接连发表同类性质的文章，一个劲地想把吴晗反党、反社会主义的政治问题，往所谓“纯学术”问题上拉。发表在今年一月八日《北京日报》上的李东石（即北京市委宣传部长李琪）《评吴晗同志的历史观》的文章，就是为这个目的而抛出来的。这篇文章把吴晗《海瑞罢官》的“指导”思想，说成是一种评价历史人物的观点。同一个《海瑞罢官》，一会儿是所谓“道德继承论”的产物，一会儿又是某种评价历史人物观点的产物，就是不肯说它是反党、反社会主义的产物。
    众目睽睽，营私舞弊是不行的。《前线》《北京日报》对吴晗假揭露、真支持，假批判、真包庇，假斗争、真保护的手法，迅速为大家识破了。不少报刊发表了揭露吴晗反党、反社会主义的文章，特别是今年四月以来，吴晗反党、反社会主义的罪行，越来越为人们所认识，一个反共、反人民、反革命知识分子的面目暴露得越来越清楚了。一种难堪的“将军”局面摆在支持、包庇吴晗的《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》的面前。于是，你们才扭扭捏捏地走出来说，“吴晗是《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》这两株大毒草的作者”，并且重新发表了吴晗过去在《前线》上发表的《赵括和马谡》，想以此敷衍塞责，欺骗读者。这就是你们对吴晗的所谓“批判”。人们不禁要问，为什么你们把一些人人皆知的事情，当做重要秘密来介绍，而对于吴晗忠实继承胡适衣钵，甘心充当美国洋奴，为国民党反动派出谋献策的种种罪恶活动却连一个字都不肯提呢？
    你们批判过廖沫沙吗？
    没有。
    廖沫沙（前北京市委统战部长），就是当年把刻毒的话“换掉姓名挂在暗箭上”①向文化革命的主将鲁迅进行攻击的人。现在他又用同样的手法，把暗箭射向党、射向人民。请问《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》：对这样的人，你们什么时候作过批判？
    腐烂的毒草，被廖沫沙说成是鲜艳的花朵。反党、反社会主义的《海瑞罢官》是好得很，“再写一个”；反党、反社会主义的《李慧娘》，是“有鬼无害”，“能鼓舞人们的斗志”。对于这些为右倾机会主义即修正主义逆流呼风唤雨，兴风助浪，在社会上散放了大量毒素的作品，你们什么时候作过批判？
    你们明明知道，《不怕鬼的故事》的出版，是为了鼓舞中国人民向帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派斗争，却偏偏要唱对台戏，在《前线》上发表廖沫沙《怕鬼的“雅谑”》，恶意地向中国共产党和中国人民进行攻击，污蔑我们伟大的党和伟大的人民“卑怯和愚蠢”，“空口说大话”，“顾前不顾后”，是“口称不怕鬼而实际怕鬼怕得要死的人”。请问你们把这样的文章发表出来，究竟是要干什么？中国共产党和中国人民什么时候怕过鬼？你们对伟大的中国共产党和中国人民的污辱，不是同帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派一模一样吗？
    一九六三年五月六日，梁壁辉（即俞铭璜）同志在《文汇报》上发表了批判廖沫沙《有鬼无害论》的文章，接着其他报刊也展开了批判，而你们在这个时候仍然不肯发表批判他的文章。拖到后来，实在交不了账了，这才迫不得已地帮助廖沫沙发表了一个遮遮掩掩、欺骗群众的假检讨：《我的〈有鬼无害论〉是错误的》。什么“忘记了”“阶级斗争”呀，什么“失去了警惕”呀，什么“划不清界限”呀，什么“迷失”了“方向”呀，什么“不自觉地给资产阶级和封建势力向党和社会主义猖狂进攻作了帮手”呀，象煞有介事地给自己扣了一堆轻松的帽子。
    这样一篇假检讨，当然蒙混不了群众。读者严肃地对这种假检讨提出了批评，但是无论是《前线》还是《北京日报》《北京晚报》，都不理睬群众这种正当的批评。因为对你们来说，廖沫沙是必须好好加以保护的，这个反党、反社会主义的阵地，是万万退让不得的。
    今年四月十六日，《前线》《北京日报》的“编者按”似乎改变了自己以往的腔调，说：“他（指廖沫沙）决不是‘不自觉地给资产阶级和封建势力向党和社会主义猖狂进攻作了帮手’，而是自觉地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的一员主将。”但是，这仍然是一顶空洞的帽子。我们要问这个廖沫沙究竟是干什么的？从他一系列反动的言行中，完全可以看出来，他是一个混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，他是一个为“鬼”张目，为帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派张目，为地、富、反、坏、右张目的资产阶级代表人物，他是一个跟洋鬼、土鬼结成反共、反人民、反革命统一战线的资产阶级代表人物。他的反动活动事实，你们比我们知道的要多得多，为什么你们不肯作一点揭发呢？看来你们是直到现在还被“鬼”迷住了心窍。
    你们批判过邓拓吗？
    也没有。
    前几年，代表资本主义复辟势力的右倾机会主义分子即修正主义分子，在奔腾澎湃的社会主义革命浪潮里掀起了一股逆流。他们利用我们的暂时困难，猖狂地向党、向社会主义发动进攻。邓拓在这场猖狂的进攻中，是一个重要人物。吴晗、廖沫沙、邓拓，“三家村”反党小集团的组织者和领导者就是邓拓。我们知道，就是这个邓拓，在一九六一年的九月，亲自出马，纠集吴晗、廖沫沙，在一个饭店里聚餐，组织起了这个反党、反社会主义的黑店。黑店的名称是他起的，吴南星的化名是他定的，文章的刊登与否是他批的。“三家村”开业的历史，就是邓拓率领吴晗、廖沫沙一伙反党、反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物在文化思想战线上同无产阶级进行尖锐的阶级斗争的历史。
    邓拓是一个什么人？现在已经查明，他是一个叛徒。在抗日战争时期又混进党内。他伪装积极，骗取党和人民的信任，担任了《人民日报》的重要职务。他经常利用自己的职权，歪曲马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，推行和宣传他的资产阶级修正主义思想。一九五七年夏天，他是资产阶级右派方面一个摇羽毛扇的人物。他发表了许多反党、反社会主义的右派言论，《人民日报》一九五七年五月十一日有一篇化名卜无忌《废弃“庸人政治”》的文章，就是他写的。这篇文章对党进行了恶毒的攻击，要党把领导权交给资产阶级右派。除此之外，他还积极支持右派分子向党猖狂进攻。极右分子林希翎，是他最亲密的朋友。林希翎曾经称呼他是中国的“非正统的马克思主义者”。这就是说，连资产阶级右派也早已知道他是一个修正主义分子。随着反右派斗争的胜利，邓拓的资本主义复辟的梦想失败了。他在《人民日报》的职务被党中央撤销了。他被人民“罢”了“官”。在这以后不久，他又钻入了北京市委，重新上台，当上了市委书记处书记。
    邓拓颇“懂得”一些斗争的策略。一九五七年反右派运动的惊涛骇浪，使他改换了自己的斗争方式。右派分子在反右派运动中遭到广大群众批判、斗争的情景，使他心有余悸。在新的阶级斗争形势下，他不再象一九五七年发表右派言论那样赤膊上阵，而是采取更加阴险、狡猾的方式同我们进行斗争。他凭借《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》这样的阵地，用借古讽今、指桑骂槐的方法，连续不断地向党、向社会主义发出一支又一支的毒箭。《一个鸡蛋的家当》《说大话的故事》《两则外国寓言》《三种诸葛亮》《“伟大的空话”》《“放下即实地”》《爱护劳动力的学说》《交友待客之道》《陈绛和王耿的案件》《为李三才辩护》《昆仑山人》《宛平大小米》《郑板桥和“板桥体”》《智谋是可靠的吗？》《王道和霸道》《马后炮》《古代的漫画》《林白水之死》《专治“健忘症”》等，是其中之最甚者。
    对所有这些用借古讽今、指桑骂槐的手法，十分恶毒地攻击党、攻击社会主义的毒草，《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，过去曾经作过批判没有？没有，一丝一毫也没有。
    特别是那篇极端反动的《专治“健忘症”》，这是一支很恶毒的箭，它的矛头直接射向我们敬爱的党中央。他肆无忌惮地攻击我们敬爱的党。他要用“狗血”淋我们的“头部”，要用外国特制的棍棒对着我们的“头部”打得我们“休克”，以让他们那些所谓“高明的医师”，也就是一小撮修正主义分子上台。这一篇疯狂的反革命杂文，充分暴露了邓拓这帮反党、反社会主义的修正主义分子刻骨地仇恨党、仇恨人民的黑心肠。
    邓拓猖狂反党、反社会主义的行为，引起了广大读者的愤慨，他们向《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》写信，提出严正的批评。但是，你们对于这样的批评信都不予刊登，不仅不予刊登，反而千方百计地为邓拓的反党、反社会主义的罪行辩护。你们嘴上说的是“百家争鸣”，实际上行的是资产阶级的“一家独鸣”。就是说，只许你们反党、反社会主义，放资本主义之毒，不许工农兵群众和革命干部捍卫党、捍卫社会主义，铲除你们的毒草。你们实行的完全是资产阶级的独裁，资产阶级的专政。
    一九六五年十一月，社会主义文化革命战线上的形势陡起变化。一场新的反击战开始了，邓拓的合作者吴晗被揭露出来了。如果《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》真正愿意揭露邓拓，这时候，你们仍然有一点主动权，但是你们没有这样做。非但没有这样做，而且你们还请邓拓做报告、写文章，支持、包庇吴晗。
    客观的阶级斗争是不以人们主观的意志为转移的。斗争不断深入。吴晗、廖沫沙、邓拓联合反党、反社会主义的面貌完全明朗化了。广大的读者对《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》包庇邓拓、压制批评的作法极端不满，愤愤不平，盖子非揭不可了。这时候，你们为了摆脱被动挨攻的局面，更重要的是为了更好地保护邓拓等人，才匆匆忙忙地把邓拓的问题提了出来。
    提出邓拓问题的目的是为了更好地保护邓拓等人，这种说法岂不自相矛盾？不，并不矛盾。
    三个多月以前，《前线》《北京日报》不是就曾经为了保护吴晗，而积极发表了向阳生“批评”吴晗的文章吗？提出邓拓的问题，不过是这种假揭露、真支持，假批判、真包庇，假斗争、真保护的丑剧的重演。
    《前线》《北京日报》在“编者按”里，极力回避邓拓向党、向社会主义进攻的问题。“三家村”里的一个最重要的人物——邓拓，在《前线》《北京日报》的“编者按”里却占了最次要的地位。吴晗是“向党向社会主义进攻”，廖沫沙是反党、反社会主义的“主将”，而邓拓却不是反党、反社会主义。轻重倒置，掩盖要害，牺牲车马，保存将帅，这就是《前线》《北京日报》在保护邓拓问题上玩弄的一套手法。
    《北京日报》发表的关于“批判”邓拓的资料，同样不提邓拓向党、向社会主义进攻的问题。占了两个版面的《燕山夜话》摘要，只在最后用两个平淡不引人注意的小标题，提了一下邓拓的“以古讽今”问题。邓拓那些恶意攻击党，攻击总路线、攻击大跃进、人民公社的反动言论，那些为右倾机会主义分子即修正主义分子被罢官、贬官鸣冤叫屈也是为他自己的被罢官、贬官鸣冤叫屈的文章，都被《前线》《北京日报》轻描淡写地说成是“庸俗无聊”，“孤芳自赏”的东西，至多也不过是“美化封建社会制度”，宣传资产阶级思想而已。
    今年四月十九日，《北京日报》又散发了一份“关于批判《燕山夜话》的参考选题”，说什么“邓拓是艺术上的复古派”，“站在古人的楼台上”，“宣传艺术越古越好”，继续为邓拓打掩护，企图引导读者把对邓拓的批判锋芒集中到“崇古师古”的方向上去。
    反党、反社会主义，为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的政治要害问题没有了。
    这能叫做“批判”吗？把它叫做掩盖错误、包庇坏人、欺骗读者，不是更符合实际吗？
    《前线》《北京日报》的“编者按”说：“在这一场斗争中，我们得到的教训是很深刻的。过去由于我们放松了文化学术战线上的阶级斗争，使党内外资产阶级的代表人物乘虚而入，利用学术文章、杂文等形式反党反社会主义，利用报刊的专栏来开辟他们的‘自由市场’，……本刊、本报过去发表了这些文章又没有及时地批判，这是错误的。其原因是我们没有实行无产阶级政治挂帅，头脑中又有着资产阶级、封建阶级思想的影响，以致在这一场严重的斗争中丧失立场或者丧失警惕。”
    这能叫做自我批评吗？
    “教训是很深刻的”。什么教训呢？
    “放松了文化学术战线上的阶级斗争”。真是放松了吗？
    “使党内外资产阶级的代表人物乘虚而入，利用学术文章、杂文等形式反党反社会主义”。真是被别人乘虚而入吗？真是被别人利用了吗？
    “其原因是我们没有实行无产阶级政治挂帅”。没有无产阶级政治挂帅，那末是哪个阶级的政治在挂帅呢？
    “头脑中又有着资产阶级、封建阶级思想的影响”。只有一点儿资产阶级、封建阶级的思想影响吗？
    “以致在这一场严重的斗争中丧失立场或者丧失警惕。”是丧失立场吗？是丧失警惕吗？
    统统不是。
    《前线》《北京日报》，还有那份《北京晚报》，在最近几年的一个相当长的时间里，本身就是邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等人猖狂向党、向社会主义进攻的工具，而不是什么不自觉地被人“利用”的问题。你们这个阵地，不是无产阶级的阵地，而是资产阶级的阵地。邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等人在过去的一个相当长的时间里，本来就是安安稳稳地坐在市委、市人委的大门里当官做老爷，发号施令，忠实执行着修正主义路线，企图用“和平演变”的方法实现资本主义复辟的梦想，而根本不是什么被“资产阶级的代表人物乘虚而入”的问题。你们是打着“红旗”反红旗，披着马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的外衣反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。你们喊着无产阶级专政和社会主义的口号来丑化无产阶级专政，丑化社会主义制度。你们是挂着共产党的招牌，窃取党报、党刊的名义来反党、反社会主义。你们在我国社会主义同资本主义两条道路严重斗争的时刻，一直是站在资产阶级的立场上加紧同无产阶级进行着尖锐的阶级斗争，而绝不是什么放松了阶级斗争。你们没有无产阶级的政治挂帅，却有着资产阶级的政治挂帅。你们的资产阶级反动思想顽固得很，资产阶级反动立场坚定得很，资产阶级反动嗅觉灵敏得很，资产阶级党性强烈得很。直到不久以前，你们还在挥舞板斧，把别人批判邓拓文章中的要害问题统统砍去，说什么“这个不能联系”，“那个不能成立”，“不管人家怎么搞，我们还是按学术讨论搞”，这怎么是头脑中仅有一点儿资产阶级、封建阶级的思想影响，或者是什么丧失立场、丧失警惕呢？
    假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。抹胭脂搽粉，是遮盖不住丑陋的面孔的。你们过去放了那么许多毒，出了那么许多牛鬼蛇神，又耍了那么许多恶劣手法来抗拒文化革命，今天用几句空话，就能向读者交代过去吗？
      《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》到了彻底革命的时候了。在国内外阶级敌人大刮黑风的时候，是谁积极支持邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙进行反党、反社会主义的活动呢？邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的反党、反社会主义活动遭到革命群众反击以后，是谁用各种办法包庇邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙呢？后来，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的问题包不住了，又是谁指使你们玩弄那一套“牺牲车马，保存将帅”的假批判把戏呢？所有这些问题，你们掩盖是掩盖不住的，回避是回避不了的。隐瞒是不能持久的，群众的眼睛是雪亮的，你们不揭发，群众要揭发，你们不批判，群众要批判。我们相信《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》编辑部一切愿意革命的同志，一定能够勇敢地站出来，举起毛泽东思想红旗，同资产阶级的代表人物彻底决裂，大胆揭露和批判你们反党、反社会主义的罪恶事实。
    邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等人有组织、有计划、有领导的反党事件，应当引起我们的高度警惕。强大的社会主义革命力量把一批批资产阶级代表人物打下台去，但是这并不等于万事大吉。我们应该看到，还会有一些资产阶级代表人物继续登台表演。不同的是他们的表演方式会经常变花样，有的是赤裸裸的，有的则比较隐蔽，有时分散出击，有时集中进攻。我们一定要积极参加当前的运动，坚决地同各式各样的资产阶级代表人物展开斗争，把社会主义文化革命进行到底。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是无敌的。一切已出笼、未出笼的，台上、台下的牛鬼蛇神在这样伟大力量的面前，都是不堪一击的。日薄西山、气息奄奄的资本主义制度面临着秋风扫落叶般的悲惨命运，一小撮渺小的蚍蜉怎么能撼动社会主义的参天大树？
