    Make the Monsters and Demons Show Their True Colors
    We liberated serfs must drag out this gang of anti-Party black gangsters like we catch harmful field mice.
    Tibet

    The vast numbers of liberated serfs and Tibetan and Han workers in Tibet are revealing the crimes of Deng Tuo, the boss of the "Three-Family Village" black inn, and his accomplices like Wu Han with boundless anger.
    Deng Tuo, Wu Han and others' anti-Party, anti-socialist words and deeds have deeply angered the liberated serfs who are sowing seeds to compete for the eighth bumper year. Dejue, an old and poor serf from Tongga Township near Lhasa, said with irrepressible anger: "The Party leads us to develop production, and our township's grain production has multiplied, and our lives are getting better and better. In the past, all the possessions of our serf family could be carried away by a dog, but now the collective property cannot be pulled by hundreds of yaks. Is our property like 'an egg'?" This is completely slander! " Speaking of this, the old and poor serf stretched out his left leg full of whip marks and said that he would never forget the painful mark left by the class enemies on him, and would fight them to the end.
    Nyima Tsering, the head of Tongga Township, said angrily: In the old society, my father and I were sold here from Xigaze by the serf owner. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we truly lived a human life. I, who was scolded as "livestock" by the serf owner, became the head of the township and truly became the master of my own affairs. Now Deng Tuo wants us to return to the hell ruled by the Dalai, the big rebel. This is a dream! We liberated serfs must drag out this gang of anti-Party black gangsters like we catch harmful field mice.
    Tibetan workers from a car repair shop in Lhasa, with strong class feelings, angrily criticized the reactionary crimes of Deng Tuo and this small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. Ren Zengduoji, a model Communist Youth League member and five-good Tibetan worker, said excitedly: "The Communist Party is the savior of the people of Tibet, and Chairman Mao is the sun of millions of serfs. But Deng Tuo attacked our most beloved Party and Chairman Mao, and our working class must fight them to the end. The reactionary big serf owners in Tibet hate us for living a good life, and Deng Tuo and his gang also hate the working people for living a good life. They are all man-eating wolves, and we Tibetan working class know how to teach these reactionary guys a lesson."
    The soldiers who guard the Tibetan Plateau day and night expressed great indignation at the anti-Party and anti-socialist Deng Tuo and his gang. Baima, the leader of the third squad of a certain unit and a five-good Tibetan soldier, said: "We stand on the southwest frontier of the motherland and defend the people of the motherland, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with our lives. Deng Tuo and this small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are shooting 'cold arrows' behind our backs, which is absolutely intolerable." This five-good soldier, who came from slavery, said: "In the old society ruled by the three major lords, my father was beaten to death by the lord because he could not afford to pay the labor service. After liberation, millions of serfs stood up. Now we don't have to worry about food and clothing, and our lives are getting better every day. Many people have also honorably joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao is higher than the mountains and deeper than the water! However, Deng Tuo and his gang are trying every means to undermine socialism, and we will never agree."
    The workers, vast numbers of liberated serfs and soldiers in Tibet expressed great indignation at the fact that the "Beijing Daily", "Frontline" and "Beijing Evening News" first released poison and then shielded anti-Party elements, and unanimously demanded that they honestly confess.

    要叫魍魉鬼魅现原形
    我们翻身农奴，要象抓害人的地老鼠一样，把这伙反党黑帮都抓出来
    西藏
    西藏广大翻身农奴和藏汉族职工，怀着无比愤怒的心情，揭露“三家村”黑店老板邓拓和他的同伙吴晗等人的罪行。
    邓拓、吴晗等反党反社会主义的言行，深深地激怒了正在为争夺第八个丰收年播种的翻身农奴们。拉萨近郊通嘎乡老贫苦农奴德觉怒不可遏地说：“党领导我们发展生产，我们全乡粮食成倍地增长，生活越过越好。过去我们农奴全家的家当只要一条狗就驮走了，现在集体的家业几百条牦牛也拉不动，难道我们的家当就象“一个鸡蛋一样”吗？这完全是血口喷人！这个老贫苦农奴说到这里，伸出了鞭痕累累的左腿说，我永远也不会忘记阶级敌人在我身上留下的痛苦烙印，一定要同他们斗争到底。
    通嘎乡乡长尼玛次仁愤怒地说：在旧社会我们父子四人都被农奴主从日喀则卖到这儿来。在共产党的领导下，我们才真正过上了人的生活，我这个被农奴主骂为“牲畜”的人还当上了乡长，真正当了家作了主。现在邓拓要我们重新回到叛乱大头子达赖统治的地狱里去，这是梦想！我们翻身农奴要象抓害人的地老鼠一样把这伙反党黑帮都抓出来。
    拉萨某汽车修配厂的藏族工人，怀着强烈的阶级感情愤怒地批判邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的反动罪行。模范共青团员、五好藏族工人仁增多吉激动地说：共产党是我们西藏人民的救星，毛主席是百万农奴的太阳。而邓拓却攻击我们最敬爱的党和毛主席，我们工人阶级一定要同他们斗争到底。西藏反动大农奴主仇恨我们过好日子，邓拓这帮人也仇恨劳动人民过好日子。他们都是吃人的狼，我们西藏工人阶级懂得怎样来教训这些反动家伙。
    日日夜夜守卫在西藏高原的战士们，对反党反社会主义的邓拓一伙，表示极大的愤慨。某部三班班长、藏族五好战士白玛说：我们站在祖国边疆的西南前哨，用自己的生命捍卫祖国人民，捍卫党中央和毛主席，邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子却在我们背后放“冷箭”，这是绝对不能容忍的。这位奴隶出身的五好战士说：在三大领主统治的旧社会，我的阿爸因支不起差，被领主活活地打死了。解放后，咱百万农奴站起来了，现在吃穿不愁，生活天天向上，不少人还光荣地参加了中国人民解放军。党和毛主席的恩情真是比山还高，比水还深啊！可是，邓拓这一伙千方百计地想搞垮社会主义，我们决不答应。
    西藏的工人、广大翻身农奴和战士们对《北京日报》、《前线》和《北京晚报》既放毒在先，又包庇反党分子于后，表示极大愤慨，一致要求他们老老实实地作交代。
