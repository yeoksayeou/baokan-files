    Commune Springtime More Precious Than Gold (Two Poems)
    Member of Goumenzi Commune, Xinglong County, Hebei Province, Liu Zhang

    Well-Digging Song

    Digging for silver in the soil,
    Drawing water from underground,
    Three hundred li of mountains lined up in teams,
    Listening to the commands.
    Young people, don’t know what it means to be tired;
    Older folks say:
  “Commune springtime is more precious than gold!”

    The whistle blows,
    Wild geese fly overhead,
    The old folks still dig a few spadefuls,
    The young ones still swing the hammer a few times.
  “Time to quit, time to go home…”
    The captain only urges people on,
    Tossing a few shovels of earth, and putting the whistle back in his mouth.
    The old folks say:
  “Catch up with Dazhai! We can't just use our legs,
    We have to grow wings and fly!”
    Young people say:
  “Fight heaven and earth! We are a regular army,
    This is the Shangganling cave!”

    Digging for silver in the soil,
    Drawing water from underground,
    The sun retreats downward,
    The moon frowns!

    Young Man and Sledgehammer

    Twenty-year-old young man,
    Twelve-pound sledgehammer,
    Heave-ho, a truly powerful pair!
    There’s a giant rock in the middle of the ground,
    The captain says: “Looks like an American ghost!”
    The young man roars:
  “I’ll smash it to pieces!”
    Dong! Dong! Dong!
    Crisp cracks and snaps,
    Chunks fly everywhere,
    A pile of white dust.
    Good young man,
    Raising his hammer, he smiles slightly:
  “If the enemy comes, let him taste this!”

    公社春光比金贵（二首）
    河北省兴隆县沟门子公社社员　刘章打井歌土里掏银，地下取水，三百里群山排成队，正听人指挥。年轻人，不知什么叫累；上年岁的说：
  “公社春光比金贵！”哨子嘟嘟吹，头上大雁回，老的还刨几镐，少的还打几锤。
  “收工了，就回……”队长也只顾把人催，扬几锨土，又把口哨含进嘴。年老的说：
  “赶大寨嘛！咱不能用两腿，要鼓起翅膀飞！”年轻人说：
  “战天斗地嘛！咱是正规军队，这儿就是上甘岭岩洞内！”土里掏银，地下取水，太阳往下退，月亮直皱眉！
  小伙和大锤二十岁小伙，十二磅大锤，嘿哟嘿，当当硬的一对！地当中有个巨石，队长说：“象个美国鬼！”小伙吼一声：
  “我把它砸碎！”咚！咚！咚！卡巴响脆，块块四下飞，白碴一堆灰。好小伙，举锤笑微微：
  “敌人来了，就让它尝这滋味！”
