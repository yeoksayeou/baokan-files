    Our Embassy Lodges a Note with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Regarding the Inhumane Anti-Chinese Atrocities in North Sumatra and Other Places
    Strongly Protests the Indonesian Authorities for Inciting Mobs to Frenziedly Oppose Chinese
    Demands an Immediate End to Anti-China and Anti-Chinese Propaganda and Incitement, Severe Punishment of the Masterminds and Organizers of the Atrocities, Release of Overseas Chinese Under House Arrest, and Return of Refugee Chinese Who Voluntarily Wish to Return to China
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th) News: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia lodged a note with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on the 11th, expressing extreme indignation and lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the frenzied anti-Chinese incidents organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in North Sumatra, Aceh, and Kediri in East Java.

    The note stated that since April 15, when the Overseas Chinese Association and Yanghui School in Simpang Ulim, North Aceh Regency, were forcibly taken over by the military police, the local Overseas Chinese have been living in an atmosphere of terror. On April 18, mobs calling themselves "Pancasila Youth" and "Unified Action Organization of Indonesian Youth Students" held anti-China demonstrations, shouting slogans such as "Expel the Chinese," "Smash the People's Republic of China," and "Sever Diplomatic Relations with China," and threw stones to provoke Overseas Chinese shops. At 10:00 a.m. on April 19, mobs from the aforementioned right-wing organizations in Simpang Ulim, joined by more than a thousand mobs from Meulaboh, armed with various weapons, stormed into the urban area of Simpang Ulim, wantonly destroying and looting Overseas Chinese shops and residences, smashing doors and windows, overturning shelves, smashing furniture and kitchen utensils, throwing kerosene, soap, and broken glass into wells, and robbing Overseas Chinese of large amounts of property, including jewelry and valuables. These atrocities were completely planned and carried out in shifts. Around 1:00 p.m., Overseas Chinese vegetable farmers in the suburbs of Simpang Ulim and Overseas Chinese in nearby towns suffered the same fate. The vegetable farmers' gardens were ruined, and livestock were slashed with knives. The atrocities continued until around 3:00 p.m. before ending, while a large number of armed military police were present throughout the entire process, protecting the mobs as they carried out destruction and looting, and strictly monitoring the actions of the Overseas Chinese.

    The note stated: At 10:00 a.m. on April 20, mobs once again poured into the urban and suburban areas of Simpang Ulim, forcibly gathering all Chinese, regardless of gender, age, or nationality, even dragging those who were sick in bed. Adult men were stripped naked as soon as they went outside, leaving only their underwear, and then covered with various colors of paint on their heads and faces, and anti-China and insulting slogans were written on their bodies. The mobs also uttered filthy language and wantonly humiliated them. If the Overseas Chinese resisted even slightly, they were brutally beaten. Relying on the threat of armed military police, the mobs forced all men, women, and children to run barefoot across a long stretch of scorching asphalt road and sit together on the cement floor in front of the regent's office, exposed to the scorching sun for more than five hours. Many people's feet and buttocks were burned and blistered, and the elderly, weak, women, and children fainted constantly. It was not until evening that women, children, and Indonesian Chinese citizens were released to go home, while nearly four hundred adult Chinese men were escorted to Yanghui School by military police and imprisoned until the afternoon of April 24. During their imprisonment, the mobs repeatedly looted their homes, taking away their remaining property. Rao Jucai, chairman of the Simpang Ulim Overseas Chinese Association, was subjected to illegal torture by mobs on April 21. He was first tied to the office of "KAMI" (i.e., "Indonesian University Students' Unified Action Organization" - editor's note), stripped naked, covered with paint on his face and body, and then paraded through the streets. After all kinds of insults, he was finally taken to the wilderness. The mobs put a knife to his neck, forcing him to confess to fabricated crimes, but Rao Jucai, unafraid of violence, firmly resisted the provocation of the mobs. As of April 27, Rao Jucai and other responsible persons of the Overseas Chinese Association, Cai Yuanyou, Luo Nanzhi, Luo Miaojing, etc., as well as all teachers of Yanghui School, were still under house arrest.

    The note stated that from April 18 to 22, similar atrocities occurred continuously in Meulaboh, Lhokseukon, and other towns in North Aceh. After the Overseas Chinese's property was barbarously plundered, they were forcibly gathered, stripped, painted, and exposed to the sun. At present, thousands of Overseas Chinese in the North Aceh region have been bankrupted and their livelihoods cut off.

    The note pointed out that as early as mid-October 1965, Overseas Chinese in Peureulak, South Aceh, were subjected to cruel persecution. Right-wing mobs had forced all Overseas Chinese who had hung the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China to gather, robbed them of all their property, and inhumanely murdered the leaders of local Overseas Chinese organizations, Wen Dashan, Huang Muxiang, Zeng Yumin, and Ye Baixiang.

    The note stated that on April 11, a frenzied anti-Chinese incident also occurred in Kediri, East Java. More than a thousand mobs calling themselves "Unified Action Organization of Indonesian Youth Students" carried out frenzied attacks on Dukuh River Street, Kelenteng Street, and Jakarta Street, where Overseas Chinese were concentrated in Kediri City. Overseas Chinese shops and residences, as well as Overseas Chinese community organizations such as Fuk Kwong Temple, Kwangtung and Zhaoqing Association, and Zhangzhou and Quanzhou Association, suffered extremely serious damage and losses.

    The note emphasized that the above-mentioned large number of facts show that the racist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in opposing Chinese, under the Indonesian authorities' unremitting incitement, have intensified to an inhumane point, making Hitler's fascists and Japanese militarists pale in comparison.

    The note stated that the Overseas Chinese in the above-mentioned areas, who are on the verge of desperation, have repeatedly negotiated with the local Five-in-One authorities, demanding emergency relief and resettlement, and assistance in repatriating them to their motherland. This was originally the most basic, justified, and reasonable demand, but the local authorities have so far made no response, completely disregarding the lives and deaths of these suffering Overseas Chinese.

    In the note, the Chinese Embassy demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop anti-China and anti-Chinese propaganda and incitement, take measures to ensure that similar incidents do not occur again, severely punish the masterminds and organizers of the above-mentioned atrocities, release the Overseas Chinese who are still under house arrest, compensate the Overseas Chinese for all losses, provide the most urgent relief and resettlement for the refugees, protect their personal safety, and fulfill its undeniable responsibility to send the persecuted refugees who voluntarily wish to return to China back to China.

    我大使馆就北苏门答腊等地灭绝人性的排华暴行照会印尼外交部
    最强烈抗议印尼当局煽动暴徒疯狂排华
    要求立即停止反华排华的宣传煽动，严惩暴行主使人组织者，释放被软禁华侨，把自愿回国的难侨送回中国
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十一日照会印度尼西亚共和国外交部，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力在北苏门答腊亚齐和东爪哇谏义里组织疯狂排华事件，表示极大愤慨，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，自从四月十五日北亚齐县司马委的华侨总会和养慧学校被军警强行接管以来，当地华侨即生活在恐怖气氛之中。四月十八日，自称为“潘查希拉青年”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”的暴徒举行反华示威，狂呼“驱逐支那人”、“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“断绝和中国的外交关系”等口号，并投掷石块向华侨商店挑衅。四月十九日上午十时，司马委上述右派组织的暴徒联合美伦的暴徒共千余人，手持各种凶器冲入司马委市区，对华侨商店和住宅大肆破坏、抢劫，打碎门窗、翻倒货架、砸坏家私和厨房用具，把煤油、肥皂、碎玻璃投入水井，并抢走华侨大量财物以及首饰、细软等，这些暴行完全是按计划进行和轮番展开的，到午后一时许，司马委郊区的华侨菜农和附近小镇的华侨也同样遭殃，菜农的园地被糟踏，家畜被刀斩。暴行一直延续到下午三时许才收场，而大批武装军警自始至终在场保护暴徒进行破坏、抢劫，对华侨的行动则严加监视。
    照会说：四月二十日上午十时，暴徒们又大批涌入司马委市区及市郊，强迫所有华人，不分男女老幼，也不分国籍，连病倒在床上的也要拖起来，统统集中，成年男人一出门就被剥光衣服，仅剩一条内裤，然后用各色漆油浇淋在他们的头上和脸上，并在身上涂写反华、辱华标语，暴徒们还满口污言，恣意凌辱，华侨稍加反抗，就遭横蛮殴打；暴徒依仗持枪的军警在旁威胁，强令全体男女老幼赤足跑步通过很长一段滚烫的柏油马路，到县长公署前的水泥坪上坐齐，在烈日下曝晒五个多小时，许多人脚底臀部都被烫伤起泡，老弱妇孺不断有人晕倒，直到傍晚才将妇孺和印度尼西亚籍的华裔公民释放回家，而华侨成年男子近四百人仍由军警押解到养慧学校监禁，至四月二十四日下午才放出。暴徒又在他们被关押期间，逐家逐户地进行反复洗劫，把他们残留的财物抢光。司马委华侨总会主席饶举才于四月二十一日遭受暴徒非法酷刑，先被绑往“卡米”（即“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”——编者注）办事处，脱光衣服，在脸上身上涂满油漆，然后架出游街，经百般侮辱，最后被带到荒野，暴徒把刀放在他头颈上，逼他承认莫须有的罪名，但饶举才不畏强暴，坚决顶回了暴徒的挑衅。到四月二十七日为止，饶举才和华侨总会其他负责人蔡元佑、罗南智、罗妙晶等以及养慧学校全体教师仍被集中软禁。
    照会说，四月十八日至二十二日，在北亚齐的美伦、鹿树昆和其他一些市镇，都连续发生了类似性质的暴行，华侨的财物被野蛮掠夺后，又被强行集中，剥衣、涂漆、曝晒。目前北亚齐地区已经有华侨数千人倾家荡产，生计断绝。
    照会指出：早在一九六五年十月中旬，南亚齐必力埠的华侨就遭到了残酷迫害，右派暴徒曾强迫所有悬挂过中华人民共和国五星红旗的华侨集中，抢走了他们的全部财物，还惨无人道地杀害了当地华侨团体的领导人温达善、黄木祥、曾裕民和叶柏祥。
    照会说，四月十一日在东爪哇的谏义里，也发生了疯狂的排华事件。自称“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”的暴徒千余人，对谏义里市华侨集中的杜河街、格冷丁街和雅加冷街进行了疯狂袭击，华侨商店和住宅以及华侨社团福光公会、广肇会馆、漳泉公会等，受到了极其严重的破坏和损失。
    照会着重指出：上述大量事实表明，印度尼西亚右派反动势力排华的种族主义暴行，在印度尼西亚当局不遗余力地煽动下，已经愈演愈烈，达到了灭绝人性的地步，使希特勒法西斯和日本军国主义都为之黯然失色。
    照会说，以上地区濒于绝境的华侨曾多次向当地五位一体提出交涉，要求给予紧急救济和安置，并协助遣送他们返回自己的祖国，这本来是最起码的正当合理的要求，然而地方当局迄今毫无反应，完全不顾这些受难华侨的死活。
    中国大使馆在照会中要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止反华、排华的宣传煽动，采取措施保证不再发生类似事件，严惩上述暴行的主使人和组织者，释放尚被软禁的华侨，赔偿华侨一切损失，给予难侨最紧急的救济和安置，保障他们的人身安全，并履行其不可推卸的责任，把惨遭迫害自愿回国的难侨送回中国。
