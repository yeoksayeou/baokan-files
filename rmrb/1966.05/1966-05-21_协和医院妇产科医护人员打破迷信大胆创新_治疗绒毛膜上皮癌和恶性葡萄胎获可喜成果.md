    Xinhua News Agency, May 20th – Obstetrics and gynecology medical staff at Beijing Xiehe Hospital have boldly innovated, broken superstitions, and achieved gratifying results in conquering choriocarcinoma and malignant hydatidiform mole, cancers known for their high malignancy, rapid development, and high mortality rate.
    Recently, the Ministry of Health invited more than twenty medical workers from obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, pharmacology, radiology, and other fields to evaluate the clinical treatment research achievements of Beijing Xiehe Hospital in "Choriocarcinoma" and "Malignant Hydatidiform Mole." They rigorously reviewed relevant pathological sections, X-ray photographs, laboratory reports, and other extensive data, listened to six cured patients describe their treatment process and health recovery, and inspected the work in the wards for choriocarcinoma and malignant hydatidiform mole patients. They unanimously agreed that this significant research achievement has reached the highest domestic level. This is the result of emphasizing politics in medical scientific research and conducting scientific practice under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Choriocarcinoma and malignant hydatidiform mole are both trophoblastic tumors that grow in the uterus of women. Malignant hydatidiform mole often transforms into choriocarcinoma. Some foreign experts call choriocarcinoma the "king of cancers" and for a long time, it has been regarded as an "incurable disease" by medical circles in various countries. These foreign frameworks have long restricted the thinking of our country's medical personnel, causing them to mainly follow foreign literature step by step in treatment. In 1958, inspired by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the medical staff of Beijing Xiehe Hospital responded to the Party's call and marched towards the goal of "conquering cancer." They diligently studied Chairman Mao's works and used the idea of serving the people completely and thoroughly to measure their own work. Many people criticized all kinds of bourgeois thoughts, broke superstitions, and promoted the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to act. They said that what foreigners have, we must have; what foreigners don't have, we must also have. We cannot walk with crutches, we must take our own path.
    Under the leadership of the hospital's Party committee, these medical personnel reorganized the research group, implemented a three-way combination research method involving doctors, nurses, and patients, and organized cooperation inside and outside the hospital, summarizing the experience and lessons of more than ten years of clinical treatment to carry out this research work. After eight years of repeated practice, they accumulated a large amount of data and successively overcame more than ten technical difficulties such as drug dosage, side effects, drug resistance, and preservation of reproductive function. Finally, they creatively applied a comprehensive treatment method of large-dose concentrated administration of 6-mercaptopurine (referred to as 6-MP) combined with surgery, achieving satisfactory results in the treatment of choriocarcinoma. In the past eight years, they have treated 226 patients, of which 137 have fully recovered and been discharged from the hospital, taking up their work posts. In the past two years, they have treated advanced generalized pulmonary metastasis and brain metastasis choriocarcinoma patients, who were previously untreatable, and one-fifth of the patients have been cured. At the same time, no one has died from the treatment of malignant hydatidiform mole. In addition, they also used treatment methods to preserve the reproductive function of some young women. Among the 31 patients treated, 12 have become pregnant, and 7 have given birth normally.
    The medical staff participating in this scientific research work excitedly told reporters that this achievement is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. In the research process, due to emphasizing politics and constantly transforming their own thinking with Mao Zedong Thought, they changed the past "treatment and being treated" relationship between medical staff and patients, and both sides became close comrades-in-arms fighting against the disease together. One patient said to the doctor: "My disease is anyway a 'terminal illness,' so treat it boldly. If it is cured, I can still work for the Party; if it is not cured, you can also learn lessons from me to cure more patients of this disease." The doctors were moved to tears upon hearing these words and resolved to eliminate all personal selfishness and雜念. In order to reduce the pain of patients receiving intravenous infusions every day, some nurses first conducted experiments on themselves to retain the intravenous needle, creating a way to retain the needle after one insertion for three to eight days, greatly reducing the pain of patients.
    Currently, this experience has been promoted in some hospitals in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other places, and has also achieved good results.

    协和医院妇产科医护人员打破迷信大胆创新
    治疗绒毛膜上皮癌和恶性葡萄胎获可喜成果
    新华社二十日讯　北京协和医院妇产科医护人员大胆创新，打破迷信，在征服癌症中恶性程度最大、发展最快、死亡率最高的绒毛膜上皮癌和恶性葡萄胎的工作中获得可喜成果。
    最近，卫生部邀请国内妇产科、病理科、药理放射科等方面的二十多名医学工作者，对北京协和医院从事“绒毛膜上皮癌”及“恶性葡萄胎”临床治疗研究成果作了鉴定。他们严格地审查了有关病理切片、爱克斯光照片、化验报告等大量资料，听取了六位治愈病人介绍治疗过程与健康恢复情况，并检查了收治绒毛膜上皮癌和恶性葡萄胎的病房工作。他们一致认为，这项重大的研究成果，已达到国内最高水平。这是医学科学研究工作中突出政治，以毛泽东思想为指导进行科学实践的结果。
    绒毛膜上皮癌和恶性葡萄胎都是生长在妇女子宫里的一种滋养细胞肿瘤。恶性葡萄胎往往会转化为绒毛膜上皮癌。有些外国专家称绒毛膜上皮癌为“癌中之王”，长期以来被各国医学界认为是“不治之症”。这些洋框框长期以来束缚了我国医务人员的思想，使他们在治疗中主要依照国外文献，亦步亦趋地进行。一九五八年在全国大跃进的形势鼓舞下，北京协和医院的医护人员响应党的号召，向“征服癌症”的目标进军。他们努力学习毛主席著作，以完全、彻底为人民服务的思想来衡量自己的工作，许多人批判了形形色色的资产阶级思想，破除迷信，发扬敢想敢干革命精神。他们说，外国人有的我们要有；外国人没有的我们也要有，我们不能扶着拐杖走路，必须走自己的道路。
    这些医务人员在医院党委的领导下，重新组成研究组，实行医生、护士、病人三结合的研究方法，并组织院内外的协作，总结了十多年临床治疗的经验教训，开展了这项研究工作。经过八年的反复实践，积累了大量的资料，先后克服了用药剂量、副作用、耐药性和保留生育机能等十多个技术难关，终于创造性地应用大剂量集中服用一种六巯基嘌呤（简称6 MP）和结合手术治疗的综合疗法，对治疗绒毛膜上皮癌取得了满意效果。八年来，他们收治了二百二十六例病人，有一百三十七例已全愈出院，走上了工作岗位。近两年来对过去毫无办法治疗的晚期广泛性肺转移、脑转移的绒毛膜上皮癌病人进行收治，已有五分之一的患者治愈。同时，治疗恶性葡萄胎无一例死亡。此外，他们对部分青年妇女还运用了保留生育机能的治疗方法，在治疗的三十一名病人中，十二人已怀孕，并有七人正常分娩。
    参加这次科学研究工作的医护人员兴奋地对记者说，这一成就是毛泽东思想的胜利。在研究过程中，由于突出政治，不断以毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，改变了过去医护人员同病人之间的“治与被治”的关系，双方成了向疾病共同斗争的亲密战友。有一位病人对医生说：“我的病反正是‘绝症’，你们大胆的治吧，治好了，我还能为党工作；治不好，你们也可以从我身上吸取教训，为更多的病人治好这个病”。医生们听这些话感动地流下了眼泪，决心排除一切个人的私心杂念。为了减轻病人每天静脉穿刺滴药的痛苦，有些护士先在自己身上进行了保留输液针头方法的试验，创造了一种保留针头，扎一次针可以持续保留三至八天，大大减轻了病人的痛苦。
    目前，这一经验已在上海、天津、广州、武汉等地一些医院推广，也取得较好的疗效。
