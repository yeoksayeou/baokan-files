    Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" is Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Black Speech
    Editors: Lin Jie, Ma Zemin, Yan Changgui, Zhou Ying, Teng Wensheng, Jin Dianliang
    Foreword
    Since 1961, Deng Tuo has published a series of anti-Party and anti-socialist articles in newspapers and periodicals such as "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. These anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks immediately aroused opposition from many comrades, who wrote articles to "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" to offer criticism. However, "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" suppressed these articles and refused to publish them.
    Recently, due to the complete exposure of the anti-Party and anti-socialist faces of Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others, Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist face can no longer be concealed. Therefore, "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" hurriedly published the summarized materials of "Yanshan Night Talks," with an editor's note.
    This editor's note from "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" does not mention that Deng Tuo is anti-Party and anti-socialist, and the materials about "Yanshan Night Talks" compiled under this ideological guidance also try their best to cover up Deng Tuo's fundamental problem of being anti-Party and anti-socialist.
    We believe that Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" is anti-Party and anti-socialist black speech. Based on our own views, we have also excerpted materials from "Yanshan Night Talks" and added annotations for everyone to compare, contrast, and study.

    I. Viciously Attacks Our Great Party
    Viciously attacks the scientific assertion that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, calling it "great empty talk" and "cliché"
      "Some people are good at talking and can keep talking in any occasion, just like a hanging river pouring endlessly. However, after listening to his speech, after a little thought, no one remembers what he said."
      "After talking for a long time, it is still incomprehensible, the more you explain, the more confused it becomes, or it is equivalent to no explanation. This is the characteristic of great empty talk."
      "It cannot be denied that this kind of great empty talk is unavoidable in some special occasions, and therefore has its necessity in a certain sense. But if it is generalized and used everywhere, and even made a specialty of, it is quite terrible. If we teach this skill of speaking empty words to our descendants and cultivate such a group of experts, it will be even worse."
      "Coincidentally, a child in my neighborhood has recently often imitated the tone of a great poet and wrote many 'great empty talks'... Not long ago, he wrote an 'Ode to Weeds,' which is full of empty talk. He wrote:
        'Heaven is our father,
        The earth is our mother,
        The sun is our nanny,
        The East Wind is our benefactor,
        The West Wind is our enemy.'"
    "Although this poem also has eye-catching words such as heaven, earth, parents, sun, nanny, east wind, west wind, benefactor, and enemy, they are all misused by him and become clichés."
    "Even with the greatest words and vocabulary, it will not help, and the more you say, the worse it will be. Therefore, I would like to advise friends who like to speak great empty talk to read more, think more, and speak less. When you have to speak, go and rest, and don't waste your own and others' time and energy!"
        《“伟大的空话”》, 《前线》一九六一年第二十一期.  ("Great Empty Talk," Frontline, Issue 21, 1961.)
    Note: The scientific conclusion that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" was proposed by Chairman Mao at the meeting of communist and workers' parties on November 18, 1957. It vividly pointed out that the international situation had reached a new turning point, and the socialist forces had overwhelmed the imperialist forces. The East Wind is the revolutionary force of the proletariat and the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism; the West Wind is the decadent imperialism and all reactionary forces. It is completely correct to praise the "East Wind" and hate the "West Wind." Why does Deng Tuo insist on slandering the saying that the "East Wind" is a "benefactor" and the "West Wind" is an "enemy" as "great empty talk" and "cliché"?
    Khrushchev's revisionists once incited: "It is necessary to more bravely and resolutely expose the dogmatic theory of competition between the ridiculous 'West Wind and East Wind'." Here, Deng Tuo is singing the same tune as Khrushchev.
    Insidiously attacks our Party's leadership as "being clever, looking down on the masses"
    "Human wisdom is by no means unlimited. To know everything and possess infinite wisdom is just the delusion of a fool, which is absolutely impossible in reality... Some people seem to be very clever, strictly speaking, they are just pretending to be clever or being a little clever, not truly clever, let alone greatly clever."
    "Laozi and the later rulers of the Six Kingdoms each held to one extreme, either advocating abandoning saints and rejecting wisdom, negating everything; or blindly confident in their own wisdom, the results were certainly not wonderful. Their problem was that they did not value the wisdom of the masses."
  "The best strategies can only come from the masses. Kuang Heng, the prime minister of Emperor Yuan of Han Dynasty, once said in his memorial: 'I have heard that broad planning from the masses is in accordance with the will of heaven.'... Zheng Xing, a famous scholar during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of Han Dynasty, also advised Liu Xiu to 'widely gather plans and accept the strategies of the masses.' Fan Yaofu, the son of Fan Zhongyan of Song Dynasty, once advised Sima Guang, saying: 'I hope you will humbly extend to the public's opinions, and do not necessarily come up with your own plans. If you come up with your own plans, flatterers will take the opportunity to cater to you.' These ancient people's views are very good. Especially Fan Yaofu's saying 'do not necessarily come up with your own plans.' This point is especially worth noting. Some people often like to show off their ability, be clever, look down on the masses, and always want to come up with their own ideas, trying to win by surprise, without accepting the good opinions of the masses below. People with this kind of problem, if they don't realize it themselves and don't correct this problem, will eventually suffer a big loss one day." 《智谋是可靠的吗？》, 《燕山夜话》四集, 第十七——十九页.  (Is Wit Reliable?, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 4, pp. 17-19.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, February 22, 1962.
  Note: Today, Deng Tuo talks about Kuang Heng advising Emperor Yuan of Han Dynasty to "widely gather plans from the masses," and Zheng Xing advising Emperor Guangwu to "accept the strategies of the masses." What does this mean? This is insinuating that our great Party is "being clever, looking down on the masses." Comparing these words with the slanders of Khrushchev's revisionists against us makes it clear. Aren't Deng Tuo's words the same as the modern revisionists' slanders against our Party?
    Slanders our Party as "going back on its word," "untrustworthy"
      "There are many sick people in the world... Among them, there is a disease called 'amnesia.' Anyone who gets this disease will be in trouble and difficult to cure."
      "People who have this disease... often show that they go back on their word and are untrustworthy, even making people suspect that he is pretending to be crazy and unreliable."
      "Lu Zhuo's 'Postscript to Aizi' in the Ming Dynasty recorded a story that can be used as a typical case of amnesia. He wrote:
      'A man in Qi suffered from amnesia, forgetting to stop when walking and forgetting to get up when lying down. His wife was worried about it and said: I heard that Aizi is humorous and wise and can cure incurable diseases. Why don't you go and learn from him? The man said: Good. So he rode a horse with a bow and arrow. Before reaching a single post station, he had to go, got off the horse and relieved himself. The arrow was planted in the ground, and the horse was tied to the tree. After relieving himself, he looked to the left and saw his arrow, and said: Danger, where did the stray arrow come from? Almost hit me! Looking to the right and seeing his horse, he rejoiced and said: Although suffered a false alarm, I got a horse. Taking the reins and about to turn around, he suddenly stepped on the dung he left behind, stamped his feet and said: Stepping on dog dung, it has soiled my shoes, what a pity, he whipped the horse and went back the way he came. Soon he arrived home, and lingered outside the door, saying: Who lives here? Is it where Master Ai lives? His wife happened to see him and knew that he had forgotten again, scolded him, and the man said sadly: Madam, I don’t know you, why do you say hurtful things? It seems that the symptoms of this amnesiac have reached a fairly serious stage. However, we cannot estimate what will happen when this disease develops to its most severe stage. Probably it will be either going crazy or becoming stupid.
    According to ancient Chinese medical books... one cause of this disease is due to the so-called disordered qi and blood, the result is not only amnesia, but also slowly becoming moody, having difficulty speaking, easily getting angry, and finally developing into madness. There is another cause, which is due to brain damage, a tingling sensation, a rush of blood to the head, and sometimes faintness. If it is not treated early, it will inevitably become stupid. If any of these two polarized phenomena are found, you must take a complete rest immediately, do not say anything, and do not do anything. Forcing yourself to speak and do things will cause great chaos.
    So, is there no active treatment for this disease? Of course not. For example... when an attack occurs, immediately pour a basin of dog blood on the patient's head, and then rinse with cold water, which can make the mind slightly clearer... Some modern Western medicine methods use a specially made stick to hit the patient's head when an attack occurs to induce 'shock' and then wake him up."
            《专治“健忘症”》, 《前线》一九六二年第十四期. (Special Treatment for "Amnesia," Frontline, Issue 14, 1962.)
    Note: This is obviously a fiercely attacking our great Party. After searching through medical books, it is never said that the symptoms of amnesia are "going back on one's word, being untrustworthy," "being moody," "going crazy," "going mad." There is no such method of treating amnesia with dog blood on the head and hitting the patient unconscious with a wooden stick. Lu Zhuo's "Postscript to Aizi" in the Ming Dynasty is a political satire, not a medical book. Deng Tuo is talking about politics here, not medicine. This is an iron fact.
    Curses our Party's leadership as "Zhuge Liang with juice"
    "Zhuge Liang with juice is the most undesirable. This name is found in Yue Fei's grandson Yue Ke's "Ting Shi" Volume 15, a record of "Guo Ni Comparing Himself to Zhuge Liang." It is said that: "Guo Di commanded Huai Dong, and actually built two cities, and Ni followed him... He was so confident in his opinions that no one dared to challenge him. One day, holding a fan, he inscribed on it: Three visits frequently troubled the world's plan, serving two dynasties with the heart of an old minister. He meant to compare himself to Kongming... When I arrived at Si, it was the height of summer, and I saw the guest fan he was sitting on, indeed with these two sentences, and then I knew that what I had heard was not false. Zhuo collapsed at Fulicheng, and Zhun was defeated at Yizhen. He knew that he could not recover, and wept several lines in front of the guests. At that time, Peng Fachuan was a clerk, and he liked to joke. He happened to be present and said to people: This is Zhuge Liang with juice. Those who heard it all applauded. Ni knew it and was angry, and was about to punish him, but he was dismissed, so he stopped."
      "Zhuge Liang with juice like Guo Ni is simply laughable and nauseating. However, it also proves that pretending to be Zhuge Liang cannot intimidate people. One day, the true face will be revealed and ridiculed by the world."
            《三种诸葛亮》, 《燕山夜话》四集, 第十二页.  (Three Types of Zhuge Liang, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 4, p. 12.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, March 1, 1962.
    Note: Deng Tuo scolds the so-called "Zhuge Liang with juice," saying that "pretending to be Zhuge Liang" will one day "reveal its true face." Who is this referring to? If it refers to the landlord bourgeoisie, there is no need to be so obscure. Therefore, it can only be insulting our Party's leadership.

    II. Opposes the General Line of Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, Attacks the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
    Slanders our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "talking big," "crashing and bleeding" in the face of facts
      "When you have time, it is very beneficial to read foreign folk tales and fables... If you have the ability to understand by analogy, then no matter what tricks the demons and ghosts play, they will be seen through by your wise eyes."
      "Let's look at Aesop's Fables. For example, there is a story on it that says:
      'Five athletes, usually because of lack of courage, were criticized by the people of the city, and temporarily went out to travel. After some time, when they returned, they said some big words, saying that they had competed bravely in other cities many times. In Rhodes, they jumped so far that no Olympic athlete could match them. He also said that the people present there could testify for him if he returned there again. At that time, someone next to him shouted: Hey! Friend! If this is true, you don't need any witnesses, because this is Rhodes, jump well!'"
    "Facts clearly prove that talking big can only brag, and it is impossible to take action. Until now, such bragging figures can be encountered anytime and anywhere. Among them, the size of the bragging may be different, but the essence of bragging is the same."
    "This fable can also inspire people to identify cunning braggarts and expose their bragging.
    Another fable by Krylov has the same effect. He said: 'A tit flew to the sea, and it boasted that it would dry up the sea... Those who like to listen to rumors quickly spread the legend, and first brought spoons to the seaside to attend the feast and drink the rich fish soup.'"
    "The Machists exaggerated the role of their so-called 'psychological elements' and bragged loudly. Isn't this the same as the titmouse's nonsense about drying up the sea? However, the Machists thought that with the role of their psychological elements, they could do whatever they wanted, and the result could only be crashing and bleeding in the face of actual things, and finally they would inevitably declare the bankruptcy of Machism."
        《两则外国寓言》, 《燕山夜话》五集, 第九一——九三页.  (Two Foreign Fables, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 5, pp. 91-93.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, November 26, 1961.
    Note: A discerning person can see at a glance that this is a vicious curse on our Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "crashing and bleeding" in the face of facts. If it were not so, why would Deng Tuo tirelessly talk about it having "profound significance" and being worth "deep thought"? Why shout that until today, bragging people "can be encountered anytime and anywhere"? Since it is a story, why mention the role of the "psychological elements" of the Machists? Everyone knows that the imperialists and Khrushchev's revisionists once attacked our Great Leap Forward as "talking big," "a risky plan," and "voluntarism." Right-leaning opportunists also slandered our Great Leap Forward as "rising false fire," "having a high fever," and "idealism." Look, is this an accidental coincidence?!
      "People who have read "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms" all remember that when Zhuge Liang shed tears and beheaded Ma Su, he mentioned that Liu Bei had said before his death that Ma Su's words were exaggerated and could not be used extensively... Liu Bei's understanding of Ma Su was really profound. In Liu Bei's eyes, Ma Su was a person who liked to talk big. The ancients had long known the harm of talking big, so Guan Zhong said: 'Words should not exceed the reality, and the reality should not exceed its name.' This is to warn people not to talk big, not to brag, to take a cautious attitude in everything, to say less, to do more, and to make one's reputation even smaller."
    "According to the opinion of Wang Chong, a scholar in the Han Dynasty, it seems that scholars or literati have always ignored this principle the most. Wang Chong pointed out in "Lun Heng": 'The words of Confucian scholars are full of beauty and exceed the reality.' His meaning is obviously that literati often like to talk big. In fact, there are all kinds of other people who like to talk big, not just literati."
      "Lu Zhuo satirized Ji Sunshi for being jealous of Meng Changjun's ability to support three thousand retainers, so he bragged that he also had three thousand retainers, but he couldn't stand the on-the-spot observation, and he was exposed at a glance. Lu Zhuo wrote this fabricated story with the aim of educating the world not to brag."
      "Although there are many true stories of people who talked big in history, these fabricated stories are more generalized. They concentrate the various tricks of talking big in typical plots, which can attract more attention, raise vigilance, and therefore have more educational significance."
        《说大话的故事》, 《燕山夜话》五集, 第八八——九○页.  (The Story of Talking Big, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 5, pp. 88-90.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, June 11, 1961.
    "Wang Anshi was a great political reformer in the Song Dynasty. He had many innovative ideas, but lacked practical knowledge and experience. Zhang Lei of the Song Dynasty said in "Mingdao Magazine":
  'When Wang Jinggong was prime minister, he talked a lot about water conservancy projects in the world. At that time, someone was willing to work on Taihu Lake, saying that he could get tens of thousands of acres of good farmland. Everyone laughed at him. Jinggong talked about it with guests, and Liu Gongfu, a scholar, was sitting at the table and immediately replied: This is easy to do. Jinggong said: How? Gongfu said: Just open another Taihu Lake to drain the water. Gong laughed loudly.' There were many similar jokes during Wang Anshi's administration. These only prove that Wang Anshi had many impractical ideas. In particular, he was not humble, which can be said to be his big problem."

    Note: Deng Tuo repeatedly attacks the so-called talking big and bragging, and says that people who like to talk big are "not just literati," but also "great politicians." Is he talking about history? No, this is using the past to satirize the present, this is attempting to incite people to oppose the Party's general line and attack the Great Leap Forward.
    Slanders our Party for not cherishing labor during the Great Leap Forward
    "As early as the Spring and Autumn Period, the Warring States Period, and the periods before and after them, many ancient great politicians already knew the importance of cherishing labor... Through their own ruling experience, they also discovered the 'limit' of so-called 'using the people's labor,' which is actually discovering certain objective laws of the rise and fall of labor."
      "The "Book of Rites" ("Wang Zhi Chapter") writes: 'When using the people's labor, it should not exceed three days a year.' Chen Hao, a scholar in the Yuan Dynasty, annotated: 'Using the people's labor is for building city walls, roads, alleys, ditches, temples, etc.' In fact, in modern terms, this refers to the labor used for various basic construction projects. According to the level of productivity in that society, the ancients stipulated that the labor used for various basic construction projects should only account for about 1% of the total labor force. Now it seems that this ratio is appropriate for ancient countries that rely on agricultural production."
      "Hu Yan of Jin advised Prince Chong'er, saying: 'Accumulate strength for twelve years, and you can go far.' Twelve years is called a cycle. At that time, Hu Yan was accompanying Chong'er as he passed through Wu Lu of the Wei Kingdom, and he predicted: 'In twelve years, you will definitely win this land.'... From this story, people like Hu Yan, under the historical conditions of ancient times, can be considered to have understood the accumulation of strength. The ancients in the seventh century BC still understood these principles, and we should of course understand these principles more clearly in the 1960s."
    "We should draw new inspiration from the experience of the ancients."
        《爱护劳动力的学说》, 《燕山夜话》一集, 第五六——五八页.  (The Theory of Cherishing Labor, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 1, pp. 56-58.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, April 30, 1961.
    Note: Saying that the ancients "discovered the laws of the rise and fall of labor" is completely nonsense. Saying that "we should of course understand these principles more clearly in the 1960s" and that we should "draw new inspiration from the experience of the ancients" is obviously attacking us for not cherishing labor during the Great Leap Forward, in basic construction and water conservancy projects.

    Slanders our socialist construction cause as "finished"
      "Indeed, any great wealth often begins with a very small amount when it is first accumulated. This is just like the principle that accumulating armpits can make a fur coat, and droplets can become rivers. However, this does not mean that in any situation, as long as you have an egg, it is equal to having a fortune. Things can never be so simple and easy."
      "During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, there was a novelist named Jiang Yingke. He compiled a "Xuetao Novel," in which there was a story that said: 'A man in the city was very poor, unable to plan for the evening in the morning. One day, he picked up a chicken egg and happily told his wife: I have a fortune. His wife asked where it was. He showed her the egg and said: This is it, but it will take ten years for the fortune to be achieved. So he discussed with his wife and said: I will take this egg and borrow a hen from my neighbor to incubate it. When the chicks are hatched, I will take one of the females and bring it back to lay eggs. In one month, I can get fifteen chickens. Within two years, chickens will lay chickens again, and I can get three hundred chickens, which can be exchanged for ten gold. I will exchange ten gold for five cows, and the cows will lay cows again. In three years, I can get twenty-five cows. The offspring of the cows will lay cows again. In three years, I can get one hundred and fifty cows, which can be exchanged for three hundred gold. I will use this gold to take out loans, and in three years, I can get half a thousand gold.'
    There are many other plots in the second half of this story, which are not very meaningful and do not need to be mentioned. However, one point should also be mentioned, that is, this money-grubber later said that he also planned to marry a concubine. This angered his wife, 'who struck the chicken egg with her hand and broke it.' So this fortune of one egg was completely destroyed.
    Don't you think this story can illustrate many problems? This money-grubber also knows that the accumulation of fortune takes a lot of time. Therefore, he calculated with his wife that it would take ten years to earn this fortune. This also seems reasonable. However, his plan has no reliable basis at all, and is completely based on an assumption. Each step is based on the result of the previous assumption. He completely replaced reality with fantasy for things ten years later, fully showing the true colors of a money-grubber, which aroused his wife's anger, and with one punch, his fortune was wiped out."
       《一个鸡蛋的家当》, 《燕山夜话》一集, 第七六——七七页.  (The Fortune of One Egg, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 1, pp. 76-77.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, June 18, 1961.
    Note: When our Party proposed a socialist economic construction plan, Khrushchev's revisionists said, "It remains to be seen how much truth there is"; when we encountered temporary difficulties, they attacked our Great Leap Forward as "failed" and "collapsed." Deng Tuo said in this essay that he was daydreaming, "replacing reality with fantasy," and that "the fortune of one egg" was "completely destroyed." Isn't this also attacking our Great Leap Forward as "failed"? Isn't this echoing Khrushchev's revisionists?

    Viciously attacks the dictatorship of the proletariat
      "In the past, historians also had many comments on the way of kings and the way of hegemons. From our current point of view, how should we view the way of kings and the way of hegemons?"
    "(Liu Xiang) wrote in his "New Preface" ("Good Planning Chapter"): 'The way of kings is like a whetstone, based on human feelings and emerging from etiquette and righteousness.' He also wrote in another place in the same volume: 'The Three Dynasties did not use the same way to rule, and the Five Hegemons did not use the same law to become hegemons.' It seems that Liu Xiang praised the way of kings and did not approve of the way of hegemons. He regarded the way of kings as the result of the combination of human feelings and legal and moral principles. This also makes sense. Because the "Book of Rites" wrote long ago: 'Etiquette, music, punishment, and politics, reaching four directions without contradiction, then the way of kings is complete.' In this way, the so-called way of kings is actually a certain attitude and action taken by people in a certain historical period when dealing with all problems, according to the prevailing human feelings and social moral standards, and on the premise of not violating the political and legal system at that time. Conversely, if you disregard everything, rely on power, be arrogant and strong, boss people around, and seize by trickery, it is the so-called way of hegemons."
      "From our current point of view, in our language, what exactly is the way of kings and what is the way of hegemons? The so-called way of kings can be interpreted as the ideological style of the mass line that honestly starts from reality; and the so-called way of hegemons can also be interpreted as the ideological style of arbitrary decision-making that is bluffing (according to the "Beijing Evening News," it is "fraudulent"). However, this interpretation cannot be imposed on the ancients, and it is not realistic to use this point of view to comment on the ancients."
    "But in any case, from ancient history, people can also easily find experiences and lessons that show that even in ancient times, the way of kings was much better than the way of hegemons. Ban Gu, the author of the "Book of Han," when recounting the situation of the princes vying for hegemony before the Qin and Han Dynasties, satirized the way of hegemons in several places. For example, he said: 'Duke Wen of Jin was about to practice the way of hegemons, so he attacked Wei, arrested the Earl of Cao, defeated Chu at Chengpu, and met with the princes again.' This makes people feel at a glance how unpopular it was to make enemies everywhere when you wanted to be a hegemon at that time!"
        《王道和霸道》, 《燕山夜话》四集, 第十三——十六页.  (The Way of Kings and the Way of Hegemons, Yanshan Night Talks, Volume 4, pp. 13-16.) Originally published in Beijing Evening News, February 25, 1962.
    Note: This is a piece of article that uses the past to satirize the present and viciously attack the dictatorship of the proletariat. Deng Tuo scolds us for "relying on power, being arrogant and strong," and "being unpopular." May I ask: unpopular with whom? It is the hearts of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The dictatorship of the proletariat can only implement the "way of hegemons" against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and never implement "benevolent governance"; to implement the so-called "way of kings" or "benevolent governance" against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists is to betray the revolution and betray the people.

    III. Advocates for Right-leaning Opportunists Who Have Been Dismissed from Their Posts, Praising Their Anti-Party "Integrity," Encouraging Them to Make a Comeback
    Defends "Li Sancai," the Minister of Revenue Who Was Dismissed from His Post
      "Among the historical figures in Beijing, the deeds of Li Sancai of Tongzhou in the Ming Dynasty seem to have been buried for a long time. This is a pity for those who study local history.
    Recently, I accidentally talked about this person with individual friends in the historical field. After returning and consulting some historical materials, I found that the old historians' comments on Li Sancai were quite problematic and should be re-examined.
    Li Sancai, styled Daofu and nicknamed Xiuwu, was a Jinshi in the second year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty. He successively served as 'Right Vice Censor-in-Chief,' 'Patrol Governor of Fengyang,' and 'Minister of Revenue.' He opposed the method of collecting mining taxes at that time and actively supported the Donglin Party members. He is a famous figure in the "History of Ming."
    Zhang Tingyu and others in the early Qing Dynasty compiled the "History of Ming," which includes the "Biography of Li Sancai." There are a few lines of summary words at the end of this biography. It writes:
    'Sancai was talented and liked to use tricks, and was good at co-opting courtiers. He made friends all over the world during his thirteen years in Huai. His nature was unable to maintain integrity, so he was destroyed by the public. Later, those who attacked Sancai, such as Shao Fuzhong and Xu Zhaokui, were all attached to Wei Zhongxian, and their names were listed in the treason case; and those who recommended Sancai, such as Gu Xiancheng, Zou Yuanbiao, Zhao Nanxing, and Liu Zongzhou, were all famous ministers of the time, so the world regarded Sancai as virtuous.'"
    "The "History of Ming" says that Li Sancai 'liked to use tricks and was good at co-opting courtiers.' This is not a good word. If you say that, Li Sancai seems to be a person who is used to playing tricks and manipulating power. However, this is not the case. According to the materials of the "Veritable Records of Emperor Shenzong of Ming," Li Sancai repeatedly presented memorials in the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth years of Wanli of Shenzong, stating the harms of mining taxes. He boldly exposed the crimes of eunuchs using the name of collecting mining taxes to extort money and do evil. In the thirtieth and thirty-first years of Wanli, he repeatedly presented memorials against mining taxes, and proposed to repair river channels, build water gates, and prevent floods and droughts. These proposals were not adopted, but were 'deprived of salary for five months.' How can this be said to be 'liking to use tricks and being good at co-opting courtiers'?"
    "Because repeated memorials had no results, Li Sancai once requested to resign and go home."
      "Of course, at that time, there also appeared the 'Donglin Party members' who attacked the dark feudal politics, and 'Sancai was deeply connected with them.' Therefore, at that time, a group of stubborn and corrupt forces tried their best to attack Gu Xiancheng, Gao Panlong, and other Donglin Party members, and also tried their best to attack Li Sancai. Later, the gang of Wei Zhongxian treated Li Sancai and the Donglin Party members as mortal enemies, which is not surprising at all.
    That group of stubborn and corrupt forces, represented by Shao Fuzhong, Xu Zhaokui, and others, under the instigation of the eunuchs, naturally wanted to attack Li Sancai greatly. They attacked Li Sancai for being 'a great traitor who looks like a loyalist, a great fraud who looks like an upright man, and listed the four major crimes of greed, falsehood, danger, and recklessness.' Even after Li Sancai finally retired to his hometown, they still wanted to add the crime of 'stealing imperial wood to build a private residence' to Li Sancai. This may be the factual basis for the "History of Ming" saying that he 'could not maintain integrity.' However, Li Sancai repeatedly presented memorials, 'asking to send an official to investigate,' 'asking the ministers to jointly investigate,' and 'asking the emperor to personally interrogate.' It seems that he was justified, but the court of Wanli did not dare to thoroughly investigate this fact. What is the truth of the matter? Isn't this very clear?"
    "From these facts before and after his death, although we cannot think that Li Sancai's life was completely without flaws, he should be considered a positive historical figure."

    Note: Li Sancai is an insignificant figure in history. He was an executioner who suppressed peasant uprisings. Deng Tuo said that he was a good official who pleaded for the people and sought benefits for the people; defending his "dismissal" and saying that he was "justified." Why is this? It is not difficult to see that this Li Sancai is a Hai Rui-style figure, defending Li Sancai is a name, and advocating for right-leaning opportunists is the reality.

    Promotes that Zheng Banqiao was "falsely accused" and dismissed from his post, full of hatred, "the bone structure is difficult to change"; calling on people to learn his character of "being one's own master, not being a slave"

    A painting brush is the brush of spring and autumn; ten Daoist love songs are the love of heaven and earth.

    邓拓的《燕山夜话》是反党反社会主义的黑话
    编者　林杰　马泽民　阎长贵　周　英　滕文生　靳殿良
    前言
    从一九六一年以来，邓拓在《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》等报刊上，发表了一系列的反党反社会主义的文章，对党对社会主义进行了猖狂的进攻。这些反党反社会主义的言论，当时即激起了许多同志的反对，他们给《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》写文章，提出了批评。但是，《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》却扣压起来，不予发表。
    最近，由于吴晗、廖沫沙等人的反党反社会主义面目的大暴露，邓拓的反党反社会主义面目再也无法掩盖了。因此，《前线》和《北京日报》才匆匆忙忙地发表了《燕山夜话》的摘要材料，加了编者按。
    《前线》《北京日报》的这个编者按，不提邓拓是反党反社会主义，在这个思想指导下，所编的关于《燕山夜话》的材料，也是竭力掩盖邓拓反党反社会主义这个根本问题。
    我们认为，邓拓的《燕山夜话》是反党反社会主义的黑话。我们根据自己的看法，也摘编了《燕山夜话》的材料，并加了按语，请大家加以对照、比较，进行研究。一、恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党
    恶毒地攻击东风压倒西风的科学论断，是“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”
      “有的人擅长于说话，可以在任何场合，嘴里说个不停，真好比悬河之口，滔滔不绝。但是，听完他的说话以后，稍一回想，都不记得他说的是什么了。”
      “说了半天还是不知所云，越解释越糊涂，或者等于没有解释。这就是伟大的空话的特点。”
      “不能否认，这种伟大的空话在某些特殊的场合是不可避免的，因而在一定的意义上有其存在的必要。可是如果把它普遍化起来，到处搬弄，甚至于以此为专长，那就相当可怕了。假若再把这种说空话的本领教给我们的后代，培养出这么一批专家，那就更糟糕了。”
      “凑巧得很，我的邻居有个孩子近来常常模仿大诗人的口气，编写了许多‘伟大的空话’，……不久以前，他写了一首‘野草颂’，通篇都是空话。他写的是：
        ‘老天是我们的父亲，
        大地是我们的母亲，
        太阳是我们的褓姆，
        东风是我们的恩人，
        西风是我们的敌人。’”
    “这首诗里尽管也有天地、父母、太阳、褓姆、东风、西风、恩人、敌人等等引人注目的字眼，然而这些都被他滥用了，变成了陈词滥调。”
    “即便用了最伟大的字眼和词汇，也将无济于事，甚至越说得多，反而越糟糕。因此，我想奉劝爱说伟大的空话的朋友，还是多读、多想，少说一些，遇到要说话的时候，就去休息，不要浪费你自己和别人的时间和精力吧！”
        《“伟大的空话”》，《前线》一九六一年第二十一期。按：“东风压倒西风”这个科学论断，是一九五七年
    十一月十八日，毛主席在各国共产党和工人党会
    议上提出来的。它形象地指明了国际形势到了一
    个新的转折点，社会主义力量已经压倒了帝国主
    义的力量。东风，就是无产阶级和亚非拉被压迫
    人民反对帝国主义的革命力量；西风，就是腐朽
    的帝国主义和一切反动势力。歌颂“东风”，憎恨
    “西风”，这是完全正确的。为什么邓拓却偏偏把
    “东风”是“恩人”、“西风”是“敌人”的说法，
    诬蔑为“伟大的空话”，诬蔑为“陈词滥调”呢？
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者曾经煽动地说：“必须更勇
    敢和坚决揭露关于荒唐无稽的‘西风和东风’的
    竞争的教条主义理论。”在这里，邓拓同赫鲁晓夫
    唱的是一个调子。
    含沙射影地攻击我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”
    “人的智慧决不是无限制的。要想任何东西都知道，拥有无穷的智慧，那不过是愚夫的妄想而已，实际上绝对不可能做到。……有一种人看来好象很聪明，严格说来，只不过是假聪明或者是小聪明罢了，算不得真聪明，更算不得大聪明。”
    “老子和后来的六国诸君，各执一偏，要么就主张绝圣弃智，否定一切；要么就凭着自己的明智，盲目自信，结果当然都不美妙。他们的毛病就在于不重视群众的智慧。”
  “最好的计谋只能从群众中产生。汉元帝时的宰相匡衡，曾经在他的奏议中说：‘臣闻广谋从众，则合于天心。’……汉光武帝时著名的学者郑兴，也曾经劝告刘秀，要‘博采广谋，纳群下之策’。宋代范仲淹的儿子范尧夫，曾经劝告司马光说：‘愿公虚心以延众论，不必谋自己出。谋自己出，则谄谀得乘间迎合矣。’这些古人的见解都很不错。特别是范尧夫所说的‘不必谋自己出’。这一点尤其值得注意。有的人常常喜欢自己逞能，自作聪明，看不起群众，不管什么事情总是要自己出主意，企图出奇制胜，而不接受下面群众的好意见。有这种毛病的人，如果自己不觉悟，不改正这种毛病，终久会有一天要吃大亏。”《智谋是可靠的吗？》，《燕山夜话》四集，第十七——
  十九页。原载《北京晚报》一九六二年二月二十二日。按：在今天，邓拓大谈什么匡衡劝汉元帝“广谋从众”，
    郑兴劝汉光武皇帝“纳群下之策”，这是什么意思呢？这是影射我们伟大的党，“自作聪明，看不起群众”。把这些话同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者诬蔑我们的话加以对照，就很清楚了。邓拓的话同现代修正主义者对我党的诬蔑，不是如出一辙吗？
    污蔑我们党“自食其言”，“不堪信任”
      “世上有病的人很多，……其中有一种病症，名叫‘健忘症’。谁要是得了这种病症，就很麻烦，不容易治好。
      “得了这种病的人，……常常表现出自食其言和言而无信，甚至于使人怀疑他是否装疯卖傻，不堪信任。”
      “明代陆灼的‘艾子后语’中记载了一个故事，可以当做健忘症的一个典型病例。他写道：
      ‘齐有病忘者，行则忘止，卧则忘起。其妻患之，谓曰：
  闻艾子滑稽多智，能愈膏肓之疾，盍往师之？其人曰：善。
  于是乘马挟弓矢而行。未一舍，内逼，下马而便焉。矢植于
  土，马系于树。便讫，左顾而睹其矢，曰：危乎，流矢奚
  自？几乎中我！右顾而睹其马，喜曰：虽受虚惊，亦得一
  马。引辔将旋，忽自践其所遗粪，顿足曰：脚踏犬粪，污吾履
  矣，惜哉，鞭马反向归路而行。须臾抵家，徘徊门外曰：此何
  人居？岂艾夫子所寓耶？其妻适见之，知其又忘也，骂之，
  其人怅然曰：娘子素非相识，何故出语伤人？’看来这位健忘
  者的症状，已经达到相当严重的地步。但是，我们还不能估
  计这种病症发展到最严重的时候，会变成什么样子，大概总
  不外乎发疯或者变傻这两个结果。
    据中国古代医书记载，……这种病的一个起因，是由于所谓气脉颠倒失常，其结果不但是健忘，而且慢慢地变成喜怒无常，说话特别吃力，容易发火，最后就发展为疯狂。还有另一种病因，则是由于脑髓受伤，一阵阵发麻，心血上冲，有时不免昏厥，如果不早治，必致成为傻子。如果发现有这两极化任何一种的现象，必须赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做，勉强说话做事，就会出大乱子。
    那末，对这种病症，难道就没有一点积极治疗的方法吗？当然不是。比如……在发病的时候，马上用一盆狗血，从病人的头上淋下去，然后再用冷水冲洗，可使神志稍清，……现代西医的办法，有的是在发病的时候，用一根特制的棍棒，打击病人的头部，使之‘休克’，然后再把他救醒。”
            《专治“健忘症”》，《前线》一九六二年第十四期。按：这显然是一篇咬牙切齿地攻击我们伟大的党的杂文。查遍医书，从来没有说健忘症的症状是“自食其言，言而无信”、“喜怒无常”，“发疯”、“发狂”。更没有用狗血淋头和用木棍把病人打昏过去这种办法治健忘症的。明陆灼的《艾子后语》是政治讽刺小品，而不是医书。邓拓这里讲的是政治，而不是医道。这是铁一样的事实。
    咒骂我们党的领导是“带汁的诸葛亮”
    “带汁的诸葛亮是最要不得的。这个名目见于岳飞的孙子岳珂的《桯史》第十五卷《郭倪自比诸葛亮》的一条记载中。据称：“郭棣帅淮东，实筑二城，倪从焉。……议论自负，莫敢撄者。一日，持扇题其上曰：三顾频烦天下计，两朝开济老臣心。盖意以孔明自许。……余至泗，正暑，见其坐上客扇，果有此两句，然后知所闻为不诬也。倬既溃于符离，僎又败于仪真，自度不复振，对客泣数行。时彭法传师为法曹，好谑，适在座，谓人曰：此带汁诸葛亮也。传者莫不拊掌。倪知而怒，将罪之，会罢去，遂止。”
      “象郭倪这种带汁的诸葛亮，简直令人发笑，也令人发呕。然而，这也证明，冒充诸葛亮假装诸葛亮是吓不住人的，总会有一天要原形毕露，被天下人所耻笑。”
            《三种诸葛亮》，《燕山夜话》四集，第十二页。原载
              《北京晚报》一九六二年三月一日。按：邓拓大骂所谓“带汁的诸葛亮”，说什么“冒充诸
    葛亮，假装诸葛亮”总会有一天“要原形毕露”，
    这到底是指谁呢？如果是指地主资产阶级，就不
    必这样隐晦。因此，它只能是在辱骂我们党的领
    导。二、反对社会主义建设总路线、大跃进，攻击
  无产阶级专政
    污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”
      “有空的时候，看看外国的民间故事和寓言，益处很多。……如果有举一反三的理解力，那末，无论什么妖魔鬼怪，耍出多少花招，都将被你的慧眼一一看穿。”
      “且看《伊索寓言》吧。比如，那上边有一个故事说：
      ‘有五种竞技的人，平常因为缺少勇气，被城市的人所非难，暂时出外旅行去了。过了些时回来的时候，很说些大话，说在别的各城市屡次英勇地竞赛。在罗陀斯地方，曾跳得那么远，没有一个奥林匹克选手能及得上。他还说，那里在场的人可以给他作证，假如下回到那里去的话。当时在旁边有一个人喊道：喴！朋友！假如这是真的，你也不要什么见证，因为这里就算是罗陀斯，你跳好了！’”
    “事实显然证明，说大话的只能胡吹牛皮，决不可能采取行动。直到如今，这样吹牛的人物，随时随地都还可以遇见。他们之中，牛皮吹的大小虽然有所不同，但是，其为吹牛则一。”
    “这个寓言同样可以启发人们辨认出诡计多端的吹牛家，便于揭穿他的牛皮。
    与伊索的这个寓言有异曲同工之妙的，还有克雷洛夫的另一个寓言。他说：‘山雀飞到海上去，它夸口说，要把海水烧干。……，爱听谣言的人，听了迅速地传播开来的传说，首先就带了汤匙到海边去赴宴，去喝那丰美的鱼汤。’”
    “马赫派夸大他们所谓‘心理要素’的作用，大吹牛皮。这同山雀要把海水烧干的胡说岂不是一样的吗？然而，马赫派自以为凭着他们的心理要素的作用，就能够为所欲为，而其结果，只能在实际的事物面前碰得头破血流，最后必然要宣告马赫派的破产。”
        《两则外国寓言》，《燕山夜话》五集，第九一——九三页。
          原载《北京晚报》一九六一年十一月二十六日。按：明眼人一看就知道，这是恶毒地咒骂我们的大跃
    进是“吹牛皮”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”了。
    如果不是这样，为什么邓拓不厌其烦地大讲有
    “深远的意义”，值得“深思”呢？为什么叫喊直到
    今天，吹牛的人“随时随地都还可以遇见”呢？既
    然是讲故事，为什么又扯到马赫派的“心理要素”
    作用呢？大家知道，帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主
    义者曾经攻击我们的大跃进是“说大话”，是“冒
    险的计划”，是“唯意志论”。右倾机会主义分子
    也诬蔑我们的大跃进是“升虚火”、“发高烧”，是
    “唯心主义”。请看，这难道是偶然的巧合吗？！
      “看过《三国演义》的人都记得，诸葛亮挥泪斩马谡的时候，曾经提到刘备生前说过，马谡言过其实，不可大用。……刘备对于马谡的了解，实在是很深刻的。马谡在刘备的眼里就是一个好说大话的人。说大话的害处古人早已深知，所以，管子说过：‘言不得过其实，实不得过其名’。这就是告诫人们千万不要说大话，不要吹牛，遇事要采取慎重的态度，话要说得少些，事情要做得多些，名声更要小一些。”
    “据汉代的学者王充的意见，似乎历来忽视这个道理的以书生或文人为最多。王充在《论衡》中指出：‘儒者之言，溢美过实’。他的意思显然是认为，文人之流往往爱说大话。其实，爱说大话的还有其他各色人等，决不只是文人之流而已。”
      “陆灼讽刺季孙氏嫉妒孟尝君能养三千食客，就胡乱吹牛说自己也有三千食客，可是经不住实地观察，一看就漏底了。陆灼写出这个杜撰的故事，其目的是要教育世人不可吹牛。”
      “历史上说大话的真人真事，虽然有许多，但是这些编造的故事却更富有概括性，它们把说大话的各种伎俩集中在典型的故事情节里，这样更能引人注意，提高警惕，因而也就更有教育意义了。”
        《说大话的故事》，《燕山夜话》五集，第八八——九○页。
          原载《北京晚报》一九六一年六月十一日。
    “王安石是宋代革新派的大政治家。他有许多革新的思想，但是缺少实际知识和办事的经验。宋代张耒的《明道杂志》说：
  ‘王荆公为相，大讲天下水利。时至有愿干太湖，云可得良田数万顷。人皆笑之。荆公因与客话及之，时刘贡父学士在坐，遽对曰：此易为也。荆公曰：何也？贡父曰：但旁别开一太湖纳水则成矣。公大笑。’在王安石当政时期，类似这样的笑话还有不少。这些无非证明，王安石有许多想法是不切实际的。特别是他很不虚心，这一点可以说是他的大毛病。”
        《多学少评》，《燕山夜话》二集，第八四页。原载《北京
          晚报》一九六一年四月二日。按：邓拓反复地攻击所谓说大话、吹牛皮，并说，爱
    说大话的“决不只是文人”，而且还有“大政治
    家”。他这是讲历史吗？不是，这是借古讽今，这
    是妄想煽动人们反对党的总路线，攻击大跃进。
    污蔑我们党在大跃进中不爱护劳动力
    “早在春秋战国及其前后的时期，许多古代的大政治家已经知道爱护劳动力的重要意义。……他们通过自己的统治经验，却也发现了所谓‘使用民力’的‘限度’，实际上就是发现了劳动力消长的某些客观规律。”
      “《礼记》《王制篇》写道：‘用民之力，岁不过三日。’元代的学者陈澔注解说：‘用民力，为治城郭、途巷、沟渠、宫庙之类。’其实，用现代的话来讲解，这就是指的各种基本建设所用的劳动力。按照当时社会的生产力水平，古人规定了各种基本建设所用的劳动力，大致只能占总劳动力的百分之一左右。现在看来，这个比例对于以农业生产为根本的古老国家是适当的。”
      “晋国的狐偃为公子重耳策谋说：‘蓄力一纪，可以远矣。’一纪是十二年。当时狐偃伴随着重耳正走过卫国的五鹿，他就预言：‘十有二年，必获此土。’……从这个故事看来，象狐偃这样的人，在古代的历史条件下，总算是懂得积蓄力量的了。纪元前七世纪的古人尚且懂得这些道理，我们生当二十世纪六十年代当然就应该更清楚地懂得这些道理。”
    “我们应该从古人的经验中得到新的启发”。
        《爱护劳动力的学说》，《燕山夜话》一集，第五六——五八
          页。原载《北京晚报》一九六一年四月三十日。按：说古人“发现了劳动力消长的规律”，这完全是瞎
    说。又说“我们生当二十世纪六十年代当然就应
    该更清楚地懂得这些道理”，还要我们“从古人的
    经验中得到新的启发”，这显然是攻击我们在大跃
    进中、在基本建设和兴修水利中，不爱护劳动力。
    污蔑我们的社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了
      “的确，任何巨大的财富，在最初积累的时候，往往是由一个很小的数量开始的。这正如集腋可以成裘、涓滴可以成江河的道理一样。但是，这并不是说，无论在什么情况下，你只要有了一个鸡蛋，就等于有了一份家当。事情决不可能这样简单和容易。”
      “明代万历年间，有一位小说家，名叫江盈科。他编写了一部《雪涛小说》，其中有一个故事说：‘一市人，贫甚，朝不谋夕。偶一日，拾得一鸡卵，喜而告其妻曰：我有家当矣。妻问安在？持卵示之，曰：此是，然须十年，家当乃就。因与妻计曰：我持此卵，借邻人伏鸡乳之，待彼雏成，就中取一雌者，归而生卵，一月可得十五鸡。两年之内，鸡又生鸡，可得鸡三百，堪易十金。我以十金易五牸，牸复生牸，三年可得二十五牛。牸所生者，又复生牸，三年可得百五十牛，堪易三百金矣。吾持此金以举债，三年间，半千金可得也。’
    这个故事的后半还有许多情节，没有多大意义，可以不必讲它。不过有一点还应该提到，就是这个财迷后来说，他还打算娶一个小老婆。这下子引起了他的老婆‘怫然大怒，以手击鸡卵，碎之’。于是这一个鸡蛋的家当就全部毁掉了。
    你看这个故事不是可以说明许多问题吗？这个财迷也知道，家当的积累是需要不少时间的。因此，他同老婆计算要有十年才能挣到这份家当。这似乎也合于情理。但是，他的计划简直没有任何可靠的根据，而完全是出于一种假设，每一个步骤都以前一个假设的结果为前提。对于十年以后的事情，他统统用空想代替了现实，充分显出了财迷的本色，以致激起老婆生气，一拳头就把他的家当打得精光。”
       《一个鸡蛋的家当》，《燕山夜话》一集，第七六——七
          七页。原载《北京晚报》一九六一年六月十八日。按：我们党提出社会主义经济建设计划时，赫鲁晓夫
    修正主义者扬言说，“有几分真实性，须要看看”；
    当我们遇到暂时困难时，他们又攻击我们的大跃
    进“失败了”、“垮台了”。邓拓在这篇杂文中说什
    么想入非非，“用空想代替了现实”，“一个鸡蛋的
    家当”“全部毁掉了”。这不也是攻击我们的大跃
    进“失败了”吗？这不是与赫鲁晓夫修正主义者
    一唱一和吗？恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政
      “过去的历史家，对于王道和霸道也有不少评论。用我们现在的观点，对于王道和霸道，究竟应该怎样看法呢？”
    “（刘向）所著的《新序》《善谋篇》中写道：‘王道如砥，本乎人情，出乎礼义。’他在同卷的另一处又写道：‘三代不同道而王，五霸不同法而霸。’看来刘向是称赞王道，而不赞成霸道的。他把王道看做是由于人情和法律道德相结合的结果。这也有道理。因为《礼记》老早就写道：‘礼、乐、刑、政，四达而不悖，则王道备矣。’这样说来，所谓王道，实际上就是人们在一定的历史时期，处理一切问题的时候，按照当时通行的人情和社会道德标准，在不违背当时的政治和法律制度的前提下，所采取的某种态度和行动，反之，如果不顾一切，依靠权势，蛮横逞强，颐指气使，巧取豪夺，就是所谓霸道了。”
      “照我们现在的观点，用我们的语言来说，究竟什么是王道，什么是霸道呢？所谓王道，可以做一种解释，就是老老实实的从实际出发的群众路线的思想作风；而所谓霸道，也可以做一种解释，就是咋咋呼呼（按《北京晚报》上为“诈诈胡胡”）的凭主观武断的一意孤行的思想作风。不过，这种解释是不能强加于古人的，用这种观点去评论古人也是不合实际的。”
    “但是无论如何，从古代的历史中，人们却也不难找出经验教训，说明即便在古代，王道也毕竟要比霸道好得多。《汉书》的作者班固，追述秦汉以前诸侯争霸的局势时，在好几个地方都对霸道有所讥刺。例如，他说：‘晋文公将行霸道，遂伐卫，执曹伯，败楚城濮，再会诸侯。’这使人一看就会感觉到当时要想做霸主的，到处树敌，多么不得人心！”

          载《北京晚报》一九六二年二月二十五日。按：这是借古讽今，恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政的一篇
    文章。邓拓骂我们“依靠权势，蛮横逞强”，“不
    得人心”。请问：不得什么人的心呢？就是地富反
    坏右的心。无产阶级专政对地富反坏右，只能实
    行“霸道”，决不施行什么“仁政”；对地富反坏右
    施行所谓“王道”或“仁政”，就是背叛革命，背
    叛人民。三、为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤，吹
  捧他们的反党“骨气”，鼓励他们东山再起
    为被罢了官的户部尚书“李三才”辩护
      “在北京的历史人物中，明代通州李三才的事迹，似乎久已被湮没了。这是研究地方史的人感到遗憾的事情。
    最近我同史学界的个别朋友，偶然谈起此人。回来翻阅一些史料，才发现旧史家对李三才的评论颇有问题，应该重新加以研究。
    李三才字道甫，别号修吾，明代万历二年进士，曾任‘右佥都御史’、‘凤阳巡抚’、‘户部尚书’等官职。他反对当时征收矿税的办法，并且积极支持东林党人。他是《明史》上的有名人物。
    清初张廷玉等撰修《明史》，其中有《李三才传》。这一篇列传的末段，有几行带总结性的文字。它写道：
    ‘三才才大而好用机权，善笼络朝士，抚淮十三年，结交遍天下。性不能持廉、以故为众所毁。其后击三才者，若邵辅忠、徐兆魁辈，咸以附魏忠贤，名丽逆案；而推毂三才者，若顾宪成、邹元标、赵南星、刘宗周，皆表表为时名臣，故世以三才为贤。’”
    “《明史》说李三才‘好用机权，善笼络朝士’。这句话并不是好话。如果照这样说，李三才似乎是惯于耍手段，弄权术的人。可是，事实却不是这样。据明代《神宗实录》的材料，李三才于神宗万历二十七年和二十八年，曾一再上疏，陈述矿税的弊害。他大胆地揭发了太监利用征收矿税的名义，大肆勒索，为非作恶的罪行。万历三十年和三十一年，他又一再上疏反对矿税，并且提议修浚河渠、建筑水闸、防治水旱。这些主张都没有被采纳，反而被‘夺俸五月’。这怎么能说是‘好用机权，善笼络朝士’呢？”
    “因为多次上疏没有结果，李三才曾经请求辞官回家”。
      “当然，在那个时候还出现了攻击封建黑暗政治的‘东林党人’，而‘三才与深相结。’因此，当时有一班顽固腐败的势力，极力攻击顾宪成、高攀龙等东林党人，同时也极力攻击李三才。后来魏忠贤的一伙人，更把李三才和东林党人同样当做不共戴天的仇敌，那是毫不足怪的。
    那一班顽固腐败势力，以邵辅忠、徐兆魁等人为代表，在太监们的嗾使之下，自然要大肆攻击李三才。他们攻击李三才‘大奸似忠，大诈似直，列具贪、伪、险、横四大罪’。甚至在李三才终于退归故里以后，他们还要把‘盗皇木营建私第’等罪名，加于李三才身上。这也许正是《明史》说他‘性不能持廉’的事实根据吧。但是李三才又一再上疏，‘请遣中官按问’，‘请诸臣会勘’，‘请上亲鞫’。看来他是理直气壮的，而万历的朝廷却不敢彻底查究这个事实。问题的真相如何，这不是很明白了吗？”
    “从他生前死后的这些事实中，我们对于李三才的一生为人虽然不能认为全无缺点，但是，他总应该算是一个正面的历史人物啊。”

          原载《北京晚报》一九六二年三月二十九日。按：李三才在历史上是个微不足道的人物，他是镇压
    农民起义的刽子手。邓拓却说他是为民请命、为
    民兴利的好官；为他的被“罢官”辩护，还说他
    是“理直气壮”的。这是为什么呢？不难看出，
    这位李三才是海瑞式的人物，为李三才辩护是
    名，为右倾机会主义分子喊冤是实。
    宣扬郑板桥遭到“诬告”被罢官以后，满腔仇恨，“骨相难更”；号召人们学习他的“自作主人、不当奴才”的性格“歌吹扬州惹怪名，兰香竹影伴书声。一枝画笔春秋笔；十首道情天地情。脱却乌纱真面目；泼干水墨是生平。板桥不见虹桥在，无数青山分外明。
    这是我前年（指一九六一年）到扬州访问的时候，为怀念清代画家和诗人郑板桥而作的一首律诗。……明天就是他的诞辰，我想趁此机会对这位作家重新进行评价，似乎还是有必要的。”
      “乾隆五年他被派往山东范县当知县，到乾隆十一年又被调为潍县知县。不料山东连年灾荒，板桥积极筹赈，得罪了巨绅大贾，被扣上了‘贪污舞弊’的罪名，罢官而去。”
    “郑板桥在山东救灾工作中是很有成绩的，他完全站在人民的方面，为受灾群众谋利益，而激怒了封建官僚和豪绅地主阶级。……他们联合起来，捏造罪名，控告郑板桥假借救灾的机会贪污舞弊。清代腐败的统治阶级在处理这个案件中，完全听信了豪绅地主们的诬告。板桥见到情况如此，愤而辞职，他的上司也乐得照准了。因此，乾隆十七年的秋末冬初，郑板桥竟罢官而去。”
      “从他罢官以后，直到七十三岁死的时候为止，所谓‘板桥体’，即板桥的思想作风总是越来越鲜明突出。首先在他的诗词中表现出来。这里只举他的沁园春一阕为证，词的题目就是一个‘恨’字，他写道：
    花亦无知，月亦无聊，酒亦无灵。把夭桃砍断，杀他风景；鹦哥煮熟，佐我杯羹。焚砚烧书，椎琴裂画，毁尽文章抹尽名。……单寒骨相难更，賸席帽青衫太瘦生。看蓬门秋草，年年破巷；疏窗细雨，夜夜孤灯。难道天公还拑恨口，不许长吁一两声？颠狂甚，取乌纱百幅，细写凄清。”
    “我在这里……随手介绍一付未发表的板桥作品吧。这是《深山兰竹图》，它大约是板桥在山东范县时期画的。上面题了一首诗，写道：
    深山绝壁见幽兰，竹影萧萧几片寒。一顶乌纱须早脱，好来高枕卧其间。”
    “非常明显，这是他还在做知县而心里简直不愿做官的时候所作的，画意诗情完全一致。……把这个画中的境界和当时画家所经历的官宦生活做一对照，它的主题思想不是显而易见了吗？”
      “据我所知，现在仍然有人在认真地学习‘板桥体’。但是，我认为学习‘板桥体’的最重要之点，是要抓住‘板桥体’的灵魂。什么是‘板桥体’的灵魂？我以为它就是在一切方面都要自作主人、不当奴才！”
      “板桥曾经说过：‘凡作文者，当作主子文章，不可作奴才文章。’这句话非常要紧。他自己为了贯彻实现这种思想，所以特地刻了一方图章，文曰：‘郑为东道主’。这个意思就是说，他自己无论做什么事情，处处都以主人翁自居，自己踏出一条路来。”
        《郑板桥和“板桥体”》，《光明日报》一九六三年十一月二
          十一日。按：真是无独有偶。吴晗的《海瑞罢官》出笼以后，
    邓拓也忽然发出思古的幽情，“怀念”起被罢官的
    郑板桥来了。邓拓先在一九六一年作诗，继而在
    一九六三年著文，一股劲地为“郑板桥”的罢官
    喊冤，喊得那么愤慨，那么激动！读者只要把此
    文同吴晗的《海瑞罢官》比较一下，就会发现二
    者实在是异曲同工，都是在为罢了官的右倾机会
    主义分子鸣不平！
        邓拓的画龙点睛之笔，是点出“板桥体”的
    灵魂是“自作主人，不当奴才”，号召人们抓住
    这个“灵魂”认真学习，“自己踏出一条路来”。恶
    毒！恶毒！邓拓不是在号召人们反对党的领导
    吗？摆着社会主义光明大道，却号召人们“自己
    踏出一条路来”，这条路不是复辟资本主义的黑
    路又是什么呢？
    宣扬米万钟“为政清廉，关心民刑”，屡评时事，颇受中下层人民称颂，为此遭到罢官
    “米万钟是一位很有学问也很有骨气的人。他的生平为人确有许多值得称道的好处。他出生于明代隆庆四年，……刚刚二十五岁就中了进士，……第二年他就被任命为江宁令尹。不久以后，他奉命改任江西按察使。据称，米万钟为政清廉，关心民刑和文教事业，所到之处，颇受中下层人民和文士们的称颂。”
      “由于米万钟平日鄙视魏忠贤及其同伙，并且屡次评议时事，他就成了魏忠贤的眼中钉。特别是魏忠贤的走狗倪文焕极力诬陷好人，当时被他陷害的有几十人，重的严刑拷打致死，轻的则被削籍夺职。米万钟也受到了削籍夺职的处治。”
      “他在一幅白绫上写了一首诗题《烂柯山》的绝句，笔墨飞舞，毫无馆阁气味。他写道：‘双丸阅世怪他忙，为羡仙翁岁未央。假尔片时成异代，人天却比洞天长。’这一首绝句的意思是什么呢？这显然是反映他对于明代政治上风云变化出人意外的心情。”
        《宛平大小米》，《燕山夜话》三集，第三九——四一
          页。《北京晚报》一九六一年十一月九日。按：此文是借米万钟这个亡灵，再一次为右倾机会主义分子喊冤。
    为“李鱓”被罢官而鸣不平
      “李鱓的遭遇很不好，正如郑板桥在写给他的另一首诗中所说的，‘两革科名一贬官，萧萧华发镜中寒。’当时李鱓早已被清宫画院里临摹古画的一班画师所排挤而离开了画院，到山东滕县当了一时期的知县，又被一班权贵人物所忌，以致解职，从此他就流落在扬州依靠卖画为生，成为扬州八怪之一了。”
    “再看他自己的题诗，就更觉得这幅画的意境很深。这首诗明白地写道：
    黄叶飘萧处士林，霜华不畏早寒侵。画鸡欲画鸡儿叫，唤起人间为善心。”
      “诗意不但阐明了画意，并且反映了李鱓当时的遭遇和他的愤懑不平的心情。”
        《谈李鱓和他的画》，《光明日报》一九六一年二月十四日。按：又是一个罢官！一九六一年到一九六三年，邓拓
    四次为被罢了官的人鸣不平，歌颂他们被罢官而
    不屈服的“反抗精神”，真是“运思独苦”！四、狂妄地叫喊要我们党赶快下台“休息”
    要我们党“什么话都不要说”，什么事都不要做，一切听从邓拓们的“指导”！
      “我想奉劝爱说伟大的空话的朋友，还是多读，多想，少说一些，遇到要说话的时候，就去休息，不要浪费你自己和别人的时间和精力吧！”
        《“伟大的空话”》，《前线》一九六二年第二十一期。
    “健忘病者的症状……发展到最严重的时候，会变成什么样子，大概总不外乎发疯或者变傻这两个结果。”
    “如果发现有这两极化任何一种的现象，必须赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做，勉强说话做事，就会出大乱子。”“需要请高明的医师指导，病家不要自己做决定，尤其是健忘病者本人切不要乱加干涉。”
        《专治“健忘症”》，《前线》一九六二年第十四期。
   “山雀在牛皮吹破以后，只不过害羞地飞走了，这当然是幸运的；应该看到，在另外的情况下，牛皮既已吹破，受骗的人们就决不会轻易地放走吹牛的骗子。”
        《两则外国寓言》，《燕山夜话》五集，第九三页。原载《北京
          晚报》一九六一年十一月二十六日。
    “贾岛是当时范阳郡的人。……这一带早在春秋战国时期，属于幽燕之地，英雄豪侠慷慨悲歌，成了传统的风气。正如贾岛在一首题为《剑客》的五言绝句中写的：‘十年磨一剑，霜刃未曾试；今日把示君，谁有不平事？’这位诗人显然想借此来表达他自己的心情。”
        《贾岛的创作态度》，《燕山夜话》一集，第十六页。原载《北
          京晚报》一九六一年六月十八日。按：这几则材料，使我们进一步看清了《夜话》的凶
    恶面目。邓拓对我们党和社会主义，决不是骂骂
    而已，而是要根本推翻。所谓“健忘病者”“必须赶
    紧完全休息”，这不是妄想把共产党赶下台去吗？
    不是“书生空议论”，而是“力抗权奸”的“好男儿”“东林讲学继龟山，事事关心天地间。莫谓书生空议论，头颅掷处血斑斑。”“力抗权奸志不移，东林一代好男儿！攀龙风节扬千古，字字动心绝命词。”
    《歌唱太湖》，《光明日报》一九六○年九月七日。按：邓拓近几年来大讲“东林党”，他还特别介绍了东
    林书院的一副对子，说东林党人读书、讲学都
    “有他们的政治目的”，说他们很有“骨气”。上面
    两首诗，宣扬他们的“力抗权奸志不移”的反抗精
    神，显然这也是有“政治目的”的。邓拓之流在
    反党反社会主义的活动中搬出东林党来，大肆鼓
    吹东林党的叛逆性格，给他们的一伙鼓励士气。五、《燕山夜话》假介绍“知识”之名，行反
  党反社会主义之实
    “发端于苍蝇、臭虫之微，而归结及于政局”，是邓拓反党反社会主义的一种手法
      “《夜话》在报纸上连续发表，而对于报纸方面的事情却几乎一点也不曾谈起，这是什么原故？难道你对于这一方面的事情不感兴趣吗？
    熟悉的朋友向我提出了这样的责难，不禁使我哑然失笑。这有什么可说的呢？好了，现在刚巧有一封读者来信，要我谈谈林白水之死，这一下总算有机会谈到新闻方面的事情了。”
    “辛亥革命以后，林白水在北京创办了《新社会日报》。他发表文章说：‘中国今日之政体，民主固善，而封建余威曾未少杀，欲谋芟除，计须十五年之努力。’有人说，从他写文章的时候起，到一九二五——二七年的大革命，恰恰是十五年左右，这一点也算是林白水的‘预见’吧。然而，他的文章据说往往是
  ‘信手拈来’，‘发端于苍蝇、臭虫之微，而归结及于政局’，‘语多感愤而杂以诙谐’，所以特别惹起了一部分当权者的不满。《新社会日报》一度曾被勒令停刊，后来复刊的时候，他宣布：‘自今伊始，除去新社会日报之新字，如斩首级，示所以自刑也。’这便是《新社会日报》改为《社会日报》的经过。”
        《林白水之死》，《燕山夜话》五集，第一○五——一○七页。
          原载《北京晚报》一九六二年八月二十六日。按：长期办报的邓拓，为什么提起报纸方面的事情，
    会“哑然失笑”呢？这是值得考证一番的，一考
    证就会发现他因为办报时受了批评，而对党怀恨
    在心。
        据说，辛亥革命后，在北京创办了一份报纸
    的报馆主笔林白水，他所写的文章往往是“信手
    拈来”，“发端于苍蝇、臭虫之微，而归结及于政
    局”。这难道不是邓拓的自白吗？邓拓“辛辛苦
    苦”，写了文章，如果读者不懂怎么办呢？因此，
    他需要借死人之口来表白一番，他讲的是瓦片，
    蜜蜂之类，但“归结及于政局”。这是一把钥匙，
    我们应该用这把钥匙去“打开”他的《燕山夜话》。
    “夜话”大都“语带双关”，有其“政治目的”的
      “‘风声、雨声、读书声，声声入耳，
    家事、国事、天下事，事事关心。’
    这是明代东林党首领顾宪成撰写的一副对联。”
    “为什么忽然想起这副对联呢？因为有几位朋友在谈话中，认为古人读书似乎都没有什么政治目的，都是为读书而读书，都是读死书的。为了证明这种认识不合事实，才提起了这副对联。而且，这副对联知道的人很少，颇有介绍的必要。
    上联的意思是讲书院的环境便于人们专心读书。这十一个字很生动地描写了自然界的风雨声和人们的读书声交织在一起的情景：令人仿佛置身于当年的东林书院中，耳朵里好象真正听见了一片朗诵和讲学的声音，与天籁齐鸣。
    下联的意思是讲在书院中读书的人都要关心政治。这十一个字充分地表明了当时的东林党人在政治上的抱负。他们主张不能只关心自己的家事，还要关心国家大事和全世界的事情。”
    “把上下联贯串起来看，它的意思更加明显，就是说一面要致力读书，一面要关心政治，两方面要紧密结合。而且，上联的风声、雨声也可以理解为语带双关，即兼指自然界的风雨和政治上的风雨而言。因此，这副对联的意义实在是相当深长的。
    从我们现在的眼光看上去，东林党人读书和讲学，显然有他们的政治目的。”
      “既要努力读书，又要关心政治，这是愈来愈明白的道理。古人尚且知道这种道理，宣扬这种道理，难道我们还不如古人，还不懂得这种道理吗？无论如何，我们应该比古人懂得更充分，更深刻，更透彻！”
        《事事关心》，《燕山夜话》二集，第六○——六二页。原载
          《北京晚报》一九六一年十月八日。按：邓拓告诉我们，“东林党人读书和讲学，显然有他
    们的政治目的”，东林党人说的风声、雨声，是
    “语带双关”，“兼指自然界的风雨和政治上的
    风雨”，意义“相当深长”。这是邓拓的自我表白。
    煽动要用“漫画手法”，表达对“社会现实不满的情绪”
    “古代的人已经懂得用绘画为武器，揭露恶人恶事，表扬善人善事。因此，以善恶对比为题材的绘画，就可以认为是中国古代漫画的一种表现形式。”
    “但是，一般的说来，历来的画家们对于当时的社会现实不但不能进行分析和批判，而且毕竟还不敢大胆地揭露它的弊病。于是有一些画家就选择了特别含蓄的表现形式，以表达他们对当时的社会现实不满的情绪。”
      “最突出的漫画，还应该说到所谓扬州八怪的作品。这些画家实际上都是当时南北各地不满于现实的文人，他们愤世嫉俗，满腹牢骚，不合时宜。因此，当时的人们称之为‘怪’，而他们自己也坦然以‘怪’自居。他们在这样的思想感情支配之下，画出来的东西，就必然非有一些‘怪’气不可了。在这里，就举罗两峰的作品为例吧。……他生平最爱画鬼，并且以画鬼而成名。人们都知道他的成名之作乃是《鬼趣图》，这可以说是古代漫画的典型了。”
    “（我们）知道他对鬼的讽刺，实际上却是对人的讽刺。但是在当时的社会上，画家如果直接用漫画去讽刺那班活人，一定要惹祸；如果只是讽刺一些死鬼，就不至于有什么危险了。也许正是经过了这些实际的考虑之后，画家终于选择了以鬼为讽刺对象的这种漫画手法。”
        《古代的漫画》，《燕山夜话》三集，第五一——五三页。
          原载《北京晚报》一九六一年十一月二日。按：这里讲得很明白，“对鬼的讽刺”，就是“对人的
    讽刺”，就是用“漫画手法”发泄对社会现实的“不
    满的情绪”。“夜话”当然也是这样。
    形势不妙，暂时退却，三十六计，走为上计
      “看到一本题名为《三十六计》的油印小册子”。
      “它列举了三十六计的名目，并且引述了古代兵家用计的实例作为证明，这是他的可取之处。”
    “这本小册子所说的三十六计是：瞒天过海、围魏救赵、借刀杀人、以逸待劳、趁火打劫、声东击西、无中生有、暗渡陈仓、隔岸观火、笑里藏刀、李代桃僵、顺手牵羊、打草惊蛇、借尸还魂、调虎离山、欲擒故纵、抛砖引玉、擒贼擒王、釜底抽薪、浑水摸鱼、金蝉脱壳、关门捉贼、远交近攻、假途伐虢、偷梁换柱、指桑骂槐、假痴不癫、上屋抽梯、树上开花、反客为主、美人计、空城计、反间计、苦肉计、连环计、走为上。这里头没有增兵减灶、十面埋伏、虚张声势、诱敌深入、拖刀计、疑兵计等名目，而把打草惊蛇、无中生有、树上开花等都开列进去，似乎也不算妥当。
      “究竟三十六计应该包括哪些内容？解释有出入是什么原因呢？这个问题，多想想就能明白”。
      “那末，在古代是否有人谈到三十六计呢？最早谈到它的是谁呢？据我所知……大概以《南齐书》《王敬则传》为最早。”
    “《南齐书》卷二十六《王敬则传》中关于这一段话有如下的记载：
      ‘时上疾已笃，敬则仓卒东起，朝廷震惧。东昏侯在东宫……谓敬则至，急装欲走。有告敬则者，敬则曰：檀公三十六策；走是上计，汝父子唯应急走耳。’
    同样，在《南史》卷四十五《王敬则传》中‘……在汝父子唯应急走耳’的一句后面，还加了一句话：‘盖讥檀道济避魏事也。’”
      “檀道济生活的时代稍早于王敬则。他是南朝宋武帝刘裕的开国武将；宋文帝刘义隆即位以后，他被进封为武陵郡公，拜征南大将军，督师伐魏，三十余战皆捷，后以粮草不继，巧计退兵。”
    “《南史》卷十五《檀道济传》却写得比较清楚，它说：
      ‘道济都督征讨诸军事，北略地，转战至济上，魏军盛，遂克滑台。道济时与魏军三十余战，多捷。军至历城，以资运竭，乃还。时人降魏者俱说粮食已罄，于是士卒忧惧，莫有固志。道济夜唱筹量沙、以所余少米散其上。及旦，魏军谓资粮有余，故不复追；以降者妄，斩以狥。时道济兵寡弱，军中大惧，道济乃命军士悉甲身，自服乘舆，徐出外围，魏军惧有伏，不敢逼，乃归。道济虽不克定河南，全军而反，雄名大振，魏甚惮之。’
    照这样的情形看来，檀道济当时所用的计策，并不只是以
  ‘走为上’；如果没有其他计策，他要走也走不了。可是他用了疑兵、反间等几种计策，互相配合，使魏军不敢追逼，才能安全退走。王敬则讥笑檀道济避魏之事，现在看来，恰恰证明王敬则乃是无谋之辈。
    从上面所引的有关材料，加以综合判断，我们对于所谓
  ‘檀公三十六策走是上计’这句话，已经了解它是什么意思了。那末，由此引伸发展而构成的所谓三十六计，究竟是什么一回事，不是也就很明白了吗？”
        《三十六计》，《燕山夜话》五集，第八四——八七页。原载
          《北京晚报》一九六二年九月二日。按：《三十六计》是《燕山夜话》的最后一篇文章。发
    表于一九六二年九月二日。党的十中全会快要召
    开了。邓拓觉得形势不妙，于是，“三十六计，走
    为上计”，布置退却了。但是，要退得安全，必须
    动脑筋，用计谋。如果没有其它计策，“要走也走
    不了。”他开列了三十六计的名目，供同道者参
    考。“夜话”暂时“下马”了，“三家村”黑店照常
    营业，以便保存实力，东山再起。但是，不管他
    是三十六还是七十二计，都是跑不了的。
