    On May 17th, *Wenhui Bao* published a record of a symposium held by Shanghai theatrical circles criticizing the film *Stage Sisters* under the title " *Stage Sisters* is a Poisonous Weed Peddling "Thirties" Black Goods", and added an editor's note. The note pointed out: "The film *Stage Sisters* is a poisonous weed that expresses the so-called literary thought of the 1930s. It blatantly promotes the so-called literary line of the 1930s, advocating that literary workers do not need to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers at all, and do not need to transform their thinking, to embark on a revolutionary path. This is completely singing a different tune from Chairman Mao's literary thought. It promotes bourgeois individual struggle and propagates bourgeois humanism, using this to guide people to take the capitalist road to confront socialism."
    The following is a summary of the symposium record.
    The film promotes the so-called literary line of the 1930s, opposing the integration of literary workers with workers, peasants, and soldiers
    Zhang Shaoxiang, director of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, said: What kind of person is the film's author praising? Zhu Chunhua is actually an extreme individualist. She said she wanted to perform with her head held high and live with her chest out, but what kind of plays did she perform, and what kind of person did she become? Zhu Chunhua in the film performs *San Kan Yu Mei* (Three Visits to the Imperial Sister), *Jie Hongdeng* (Borrowing the Red Lantern), *Pan Fu* (Interrogating the Husband), *Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai*, *Fang Qing Chang Daoqing* (Fang Qing Recites Daoqing); singing what "I originally entrusted my heart to the bright moon, but who knew the bright moon would shine in the ditch," all show what kind of plays she performs with her chest out and her head held high, and what kind of person she becomes. Particularly vicious is the film's use of Zhu Chunhua's words to Jiang Bo, "I've seen several movies and plays you recommended, and our sister troupe really wants to learn from them," to tout the movies and dramas of the time, as models of revolutionary literature and art, implying that people should follow the so-called literary path of the 1930s.
    *Stage Sisters* tells our young generation that there's no need for ideological transformation, no need to emphasize politics, as long as you strive individually, have talent, and "live cleanly and perform earnestly," you can strive to become a famous actor. This film is singing a different tune from the Party's literary direction and should be thoroughly criticized.
    Yuehong selling herself for patronage, Chunhua selling her art for patronage, both are bourgeois individualists of the same kind
    Wang Wenjuan, actress of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, said: The theme of *Stage Sisters* is "living cleanly and performing earnestly." These two sentences sound very deceptive at first, and if we don't analyze and criticize them seriously, we will be poisoned by them. Because those two sentences completely remove the content of class and class struggle.
      "Living cleanly," how exactly does Chunhua live? Isn't it still individual struggle, climbing up, achieving fame and fortune? This kind of thinking is very unclean. She is making plans for her personal interests at all times.
    "Performing earnestly," what kind of plays does she perform? During the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai was an occupied area. At that time, class contradictions and national contradictions were very sharp, but what kind of plays did Chunhua perform? Did she perform plays reflecting these struggles, or plays paralyzing the people's fighting spirit? She performed plays paralyzing the people's fighting spirit, so how can it be said that she was "performing earnestly"?
    Jin Caifeng, actress of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, said: What kind of plays did Zhu Chunhua earnestly perform? On stage, we see *San Kan Yu Mei* (Three Visits to the Imperial Sister) and other plays about talented scholars and beautiful women. How can this be considered performing earnestly? In the past, our Yue Opera sisters always thought that the Yue Opera of this period was good, but now thinking about it, it was during this period that feudal toxins and bourgeois ideas were concentratedly expressed on the stage.
    Xue Yunhuang, playwright of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, said: While the film portrays Zhu Chunhua as a clean person and a hero unafraid of the powerful, it portrays Xing Yuehong as a person who went astray and then returned to the revolutionary ranks. The two seem to have taken two different paths. In fact, they are both bourgeois individualists of the same kind. It's just that Yuehong sold herself for patronage, and Chunhua sold her art for patronage. Yuehong selling herself to hooligan counter-revolutionaries, Chunhua's greatest hope is to have a stage where she can perform "earnestly," which is still relying on the bourgeoisie. There is no essential difference between the paths they took.
    Wei Xiaoyun, teacher at the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre School, said: The film praises Chunhua's individual struggle, as if a person in the old society could become famous and successful single-handedly, as if Chunhua was born a hero. The film's portrayal of Yuehong is also like this. The author not only depicts her willingly taking the wrong path in many ways, but also shows sympathy for her everywhere. What kind of thoughts and feelings are these?
    Xu Peijun, playwright of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, pointed out: The idea that the film is trying to promote: "living cleanly and performing earnestly," is not something new, but is derived from Hu Shi's notorious "study more problems, talk less about isms." It means telling people not to make revolution, but to be detached from class struggle. Today, there are still people promoting this reactionary idea, which is nothing more than wanting people to be professionally competent but not politically conscious, to take the path of individual struggle, and to stay away from the socialist revolution.
    The film promotes class reconciliation, advocates bourgeois humanism, and is a reflection of an anti-socialist countercurrent at the time
    Xiao Wenyan, actress of the Shanghai People's Huai Opera Troupe, Ding Shi'e, actress of the Shanghai People's Huju Opera Troupe, and Liu Yunruo, actress of the Shanghai People's Pingtan Troupe, all sternly criticized the film's views on human nature. Xiao Wenyan said: "The film uses bourgeois humanism to cover up class struggle. The sisterly affection is promoted very strongly. We used to have a sister who later married a puppet regiment commander. She had no affection for us at all. This is a real problem that cannot be erased." Ding Shi'e said: "This film has removed class and class struggle. The film is false. The film emphasizes sisterly feelings and erases class feelings, making a big fuss about human nature. For example, Yuehong has already become a boss's wife, but the film depicts her 'conscience' being discovered in court and refusing to harm Chunhua. This is a way to cover up class struggle and spread and promote the poison of humanism." Zhang Shaoxiang said: The film extravagantly exaggerates the so-called "sisterly affection," most prominently in the courtroom trial scene. Zhu Chunhua said that Yuehong "would never secretly harm a sister who had shared hardships together even if she fell again," meaning that you, Yuehong, were forced, and I, Chunhua, understand you, and the two are still in perfect harmony. The bourgeois humanistic thought is expressed here to a climax.
    Ding Fan, playwright of the Shanghai Yue Opera Theatre, said: According to the logic of the directors, as long as bourgeois elements are moved with affection, they can negate their own class attributes. Isn't this clearly promoting the bourgeois "two combine into one" theory of class reconciliation? The most absurd thing is that the film also uses Jiang Bo, as an image of the Party, to help promote the theory of class reconciliation. Chunhua moved Yuehong in court, acting according to Jiang Bo's winks; later, Jiang Bo also instructed Chunhua to look for Yuehong. Under Jiang Bo's instructions, Chunhua and Yuehong finally joined hands and "merged" together.
    The process of creating and filming *Stage Sisters* was exactly when we were implementing the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee of the Party and strengthening the viewpoint of class and class struggle. At that time, some people stood on the bourgeois position and resisted the socialist revolution. It can be seen that the emergence of this film was not accidental. It was a reflection of an anti-socialist countercurrent in society at that time and should be thoroughly criticized.
    The film promotes the path of serving the bourgeoisie in order to resist the socialist path of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers
    Xue Yunhuang said: Some people say that this film can play a role in recalling the bitterness of the past and appreciating the sweetness of the present. This statement is wrong. Recalling and comparing should be to recount the bitterness of the class, raise class consciousness, and expose the crimes of the old society. However, the film not only does not express the above-mentioned content, but also greatly promotes the artistic paths and lives of two famous actors in the old society. Although it also lightly reflects the life of the Yangchun stage troupe wandering and performing in the countryside, even this little bit, the author's intention is not to recount the suffering of the artists, but to use a bourgeois sentiment to paint a so-called poetic and picturesque picture in a large space, admiring the life of "singing every year when it's difficult to sing, and being homeless everywhere." How can this be used as a material for recalling and comparing to educate the general public?
    Some people say that although this film cannot be regarded as a work in the socialist category, it can be regarded as a work in the New Democratic category. This is also wrong. Chairman Mao said in *On New Democracy*: "The so-called New Democratic culture, in a word, is the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal culture of the masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat." The period reflected in this film was precisely when the Chinese people were deeply oppressed by the three great mountains, suffering the most and struggling the most fiercely, but the film did not involve this aspect at all. There is not a single shadow of anti-imperialism in Chunhua's thoughts and words. Can this be considered anti-imperialist? The film not only does not oppose feudalism, but also promotes feudalist moral codes in many places, such as apprentice-master relationships, emphasizing loyalty and treachery, sworn brotherhood, and the so-called "living cleanly," etc.
    Shi Xilai, actor of the Shanghai Youth Drama Troupe, said: "The film extravagantly promotes the bourgeois path of individual struggle for fame and fortune, repeatedly promoting the reactionary philosophy of life of 'living cleanly and performing earnestly.' The effect it has today is extremely bad. It guides people to break away from politics and take the path of being professionally competent but not politically conscious." Cai Yaoxian, actress of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theatre, said: "In 1961, I graduated from school and performed many plays about talented scholars and beautiful women. My thinking was deeply influenced by bourgeois ideas, and I thought a lot about achieving fame and fortune. If the Party hadn't sounded the alarm in time and carried out education, some young people would have been in danger of taking the path of degeneration and deterioration. This film is a negative example. We should sharpen our eyes in the future and take the revolutionary path pointed out by the Party."
    Li Zhongcheng, creative staff member of the Shanghai Drama School, pointed out: Through Zhu Chunhua's development process from child bride to Yue Opera "star," *Stage Sisters* erases class struggle and promotes the bourgeois ideas of individual struggle for fame and fortune, directing thousands of young people to this bourgeois artistic path of so-called "living cleanly and performing earnestly."
    In recent years, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Yang Hansheng and others have greatly praised the so-called films and dramas of the 1930s, promoted bourgeois literature and art, and launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. The appearance of *Stage Sisters* is by no means accidental. It is precisely a bad film that prominently expresses the so-called literary thought of the 1930s. The protagonist of the film, Zhu Chunhua, is a thorough bourgeois artist. Through the depiction of her and the people around her, the film promotes the bourgeois path to resist the path of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, replacing the theory of class with the theory of human nature. It is a reflection of class struggle and the struggle between two roads. It represents the interests of the bourgeoisie.

### 上海戏剧界批判贩卖“三十年代”黑货的坏影片《舞台姐妹》

    上海戏剧界批判贩卖“三十年代”黑货的坏影片《舞台姐妹》
    五月十七日，《文汇报》以《〈舞台姐妹〉是贩卖“三十年代”黑货的毒草》为题，发表了上海戏剧界批判影片《舞台姐妹》的座谈记录，并加了编者按语。按语指出：影片《舞台姐妹》是“表现所谓三十年代文艺思想的一株毒草。它露骨地宣扬了所谓三十年代的文艺路线，鼓吹文艺工作者根本不必要与工农兵相结合，不必要改造思想，就能走上革命的道路，这完全是在和毛主席的文艺思想唱对台戏。它鼓吹资产阶级的个人奋斗，宣扬资产阶级的人性论，以此引导人们走资本主义道路，来和社会主义相对抗。”
    现将座谈记录综述如下。
    影片宣扬了所谓三十年代文艺路线，反对文艺工作者与工农兵相结合
    上海越剧院导演张少祥说：影片作者歌颂的究竟是什么样的人物？竺春花实际上是个极端的个人主义者，她说要昂首演戏、挺胸做人，但她究竟演的是什么戏，做的是什么人？竺春花在影片中演的是《三看御妹》《借红灯》《盘夫》《梁山伯与祝英台》《方卿唱道情》；唱什么“我本将心托明月，谁知明月照沟渠”，都说明她挺胸昂首地演的是什么戏，做的是什么人。特别恶毒的是影片通过竺春花对江波的话，“你介绍的几个电影和话剧我都看过了，我们姐妹班真想学他们那样”，借以标榜当时的电影和戏剧，作为革命文艺的样板，暗示人们应该按照所谓三十年代文艺的道路走去。
    《舞台姐妹》叫我们年轻的一代用不着思想改造，用不着突出政治，只要个人奋斗，有本领，去“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”，争取做个名演员就可以了。这部影片是与党的文艺方向唱对台戏，应该彻底批判。
    月红卖身投靠，春花卖艺投靠，同是资产阶级个人主义一路货色
    上海越剧院演员王文娟说：《舞台姐妹》的主题思想是“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”。这两句话乍听起来，很能迷惑人，如果不严肃认真地来分析、批判它，就会受到它的毒害。因为那两句话把阶级、阶级斗争的内容完全抽掉了。
      “清清白白的做人”，究竟春花是在怎样做人？还不是个人奋斗、往上爬、成名成家？这种思想就很不清白。她随时随地都是为着个人的利益在作打算。
    “认认真真的唱戏”，唱啥戏呀？抗日战争时期，上海是沦陷区，当时阶级矛盾和民族矛盾非常尖锐，可是春花在演些什么戏呢？是演的反映这些斗争的戏呢，还是演的麻痹人民斗志的戏？演的是麻痹人民斗志的戏，这怎么能说得上是“认认真真的唱戏”？
    上海越剧院演员金采风说：竺春花到底认认真真唱了些什么戏呢？我们在台上看到的是《三看御妹》等才子佳人戏，这怎么能算认认真真唱戏呢？过去我们越剧界的姐妹，总认为这个时期的越剧是不错的，现在想想，就是这个时候，在舞台上集中地表现出来的也都是封建毒素和资产阶级思想。
    上海越剧院编剧薛允璜说：影片把竺春花描写成清白做人不畏强暴的英雄的同时，把邢月红写成误入歧途而后又重返革命队伍的一个人物，两人似乎走了两条道路。其实都是资产阶级个人主义的一路货色，只不过月红是卖身投靠，春花是卖艺投靠而已。月红卖身投靠流氓反革命，春花最大的希望是有一个舞台可以“认真”演戏，依然是投靠资产阶级，两个人所走的道路，绝无本质的差别。
    上海越剧院学馆教师魏小云说：影片歌颂春花个人奋斗，好象在旧社会一个人单枪匹马就能成名成家成大事，好象春花天生成是个英雄。影片对月红的描写也是这样，作者既多方面地刻划她心甘情愿走邪路，但又处处加以同情。这是什么样的思想感情？
    上海越剧院编剧徐佩珺指出：影片竭力宣扬的思想：“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”，不是什么新货色，而是从胡适的臭名昭著的“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”那里脱胎而来的。意思是叫人不要革命，而要超然于阶级斗争之外。今天仍然有人来宣传这种反动思想，无非是要人们只专不红，走个人奋斗的道路，远离社会主义革命。
    影片宣扬了阶级调和，鼓吹了资产阶级人性论，是当时一股反社会主义逆流的反映
    上海市人民淮剧团演员筱文艳、上海人民沪剧团演员丁是娥、上海市人民评弹团演员刘韵若等，都严正地批判了影片的人性论观点。筱文艳说：“影片以资产阶级人性论掩盖了阶级斗争。姐妹之情宣扬得十分厉害。从前我们有个姐妹，后来嫁了伪团长，她对我们哪有一点情分？这是个现实问题，不容抹煞。”丁是娥说：“这部影片把阶级、阶级斗争抽掉了，影片是虚假的。片中强调了姐妹感情，抹煞了阶级感情，在人性论上大做文章。例如月红已经变成了老板娘，影片却描写她在法庭上‘良心’发现，不肯坑害春花。这是掩盖阶级斗争，散布、宣扬人性论的毒素的一种方法。”张少祥说：影片大肆渲染所谓“姐妹情分”，最突出的是法庭审判这一场。竺春花说月红“再堕落也决不会暗害一起同过患难的姐妹”，意思是你月红是被迫的，我春花是了解你的，两人还是心心相印。资产阶级人性论思想在这里的表现到了一个高潮。
    上海越剧院编剧丁凡说：按照编导者的逻辑，对资产阶级分子只要用情分感化他们，他们就能否定自己的阶级属性，这不是分明在宣扬资产阶级“合二而一”的阶级调和论吗？最荒谬的，影片还通过作为党的形象的江波来帮助宣扬阶级调和论。春花在法庭上感化月红，是按江波眼色行事的；后来，江波又叮嘱春花寻找月红，在江波的指示下，春花、月红最后终于携起手来，“汇合”到一起了。
    《舞台姐妹》创作和摄制的过程，正是我们贯彻党的八届十中全会公报精神，加强阶级和阶级斗争观点的时候。当时，有人站在资产阶级立场上，抵制社会主义革命。可见，这部影片的出现决不是偶然的，它是当时社会上一股反社会主义逆流的反映，应该彻底批判。
    影片宣扬为资产阶级服务的道路，以抗拒为工农兵服务的社会主义道路
    薛允璜说：有人说这部影片可以起到忆苦思甜的作用，这种说法是错误的。回忆对比，应该是诉阶级之苦，提高阶级觉悟，揭露旧社会的罪恶。但影片不仅没有表现上述这些内容，反而大大宣扬了旧社会两个名演员的艺术道路和生活道路。虽然它也轻描淡写地反映了一下阳春舞台在乡下流浪演戏的生活，但就是这一点点，作者的意图也不是诉艺人之苦，而是怀着一种资产阶级的感情，以大量篇幅点染所谓诗情画意，欣赏那种“年年难唱年年唱，处处无家处处家”的生活，这怎么能够作为回忆对比的材料来向广大观众进行教育呢？
    有人说这部影片虽然不能作为社会主义范畴的作品，但可以作为新民主主义范畴的作品。这也是错误的。毛主席在《新民主主义论》中说：“所谓新民主主义的文化，一句话，就是无产阶级领导的人民大众的反帝反封建的文化。”这部影片所反映的时期，正是中国人民深受三座大山压迫，苦难最深，斗争最剧烈的时候，但影片根本没有涉及这方面的内容。春花的思想和言行中根本没有一点反帝的影子，这能算反帝了吗？影片不仅没有反封建，而且多处宣扬了封建主义的做人道德，如收徒拜师，讲究忠奸，义结金兰，以及所谓“清清白白的做人”等等。
    上海青年话剧团演员施锡来说：“影片大肆宣扬资产阶级个人奋斗成名成家的道路，反复地宣传“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”这条反动的处世哲学，在今天所起的效果是极为恶劣的，它引导人们脱离政治，走白专道路。”上海京剧院演员蔡瑶铣说：“一九六一年，我从学校毕业，演过不少才子佳人戏，思想上受资产阶级思想影响很深，成名成家想得多。要不是党及时敲起警钟，进行教育，有的青年真有走上蜕化变质道路的危险。这部影片是反面教材，我们以后更应擦亮眼睛，走党所指引的革命道路。”
    上海市戏曲学校创作人员黎中城指出：《舞台姐妹》通过竺春花从童养媳到越剧“明星”的发展过程，抹煞了阶级斗争，宣扬了资产阶级的个人奋斗成名成家的思想。要把千千万万的青年人，引向所谓“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”的这种资产阶级的艺术道路。
    这些年来，夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙等人大肆吹捧所谓三十年代的影剧，宣扬资产阶级的文艺，向党向社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻。《舞台姐妹》的出现，决不是偶然的，它正是突出表现所谓三十年代文艺思想的一部坏影片。影片主角竺春花，是个彻头彻尾的资产阶级文艺家，影片通过对她和她周围人物的描写，宣扬了资产阶级道路以对抗为工农兵服务的道路，以人性论代替了阶级论。它是阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的反映，它是代表资产阶级利益的。
