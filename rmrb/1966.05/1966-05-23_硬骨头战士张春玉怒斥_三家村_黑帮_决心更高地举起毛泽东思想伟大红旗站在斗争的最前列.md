    Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch: The entire staff and convalescing personnel of a certain hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a celebration meeting on the 21st for Zhang Chunyu, a hard-boned warrior of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, who was awarded the first-class merit. At the meeting, Zhang Chunyu angrily denounced the crimes of Deng Tuo and a handful of other anti-Party and anti-socialist elements.
    Zhang Chunyu was accidentally injured on June 30th last year while working on a railway tunnel construction project when a sudden cave-in occurred. He was struck by a falling boulder weighing tens of thousands of pounds while bravely rescuing wounded comrades. The leadership organs of the Railway Corps awarded Zhang Chunyu a first-class merit.
    Zhang Chunyu said at the meeting: I was born into a poor peasant family and lived a life worse than that of beasts of burden in the old society. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who rescued me from the sea of suffering. After joining the army, I became a glorious Communist Party member under the nurturing of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought. After being injured, the Party arranged the best medical treatment for me, and my injuries quickly improved. The Party and Chairman Mao gave me a second life. I love the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. The "Three-Family Village" gang, headed by Deng Tuo, attacked our great Party and our beloved leader Chairman Mao, viciously attacked Mao Zedong Thought, attacked the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward, blatantly supported right-leaning opportunists who had been "removed" from their posts, and sang "praises" for them, engaging in organized and planned activities to restore capitalism. This is a life-and-death class struggle. I will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, stand at the forefront of the struggle, thoroughly smash the frantic attacks of the "Three-Family Village" gang, pursue them to the end, and never stop until complete victory!
    At the celebration meeting, representatives of the medical staff presented Zhang Chunyu with a mirror inscribed with "Learn from your hard-boned spirit of serving the public wholeheartedly, and hope you maintain your glory and carry forward your glory."

    硬骨头战士张春玉怒斥“三家村”黑帮
    决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗站在斗争的最前列
    新华社二十二日讯　中国人民解放军某医院全体工作人员和休养人员，二十一日为铁道兵某部荣立一等功的硬骨头战士张春玉举行庆功大会。张春玉在会上怒斥邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子的罪行。
    张春玉是在去年六月三十日在某铁路隧道施工时，因突然发生意外塌方，在奋不顾身抢救负伤战友时，不幸被塌下的万斤巨石压伤。铁道兵领导机关给张春玉记一等功奖励。
    张春玉在会上说：我出身在一个贫苦的农民家庭，在旧社会过着牛马不如的生活，是党和毛主席把我从苦海中解救出来的。我参军以后，在党和毛主席思想的哺育下，成了一个光荣的共产党员。负伤以后，党给我安排了最好的医疗条件，我的伤迅速好转，是党和毛主席给了我第二次生命，我从心眼里热爱党，热爱毛主席。邓拓为首的“三家村”黑帮攻击我们伟大的党和我们敬爱的领袖毛主席，恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，攻击党的总路线、大跃进，明目张胆地支持被“罢”了官的右倾机会主义分子，为他们大唱“赞歌”，是有组织有计划地进行资本主义复辟活动。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，站在斗争的最前列，彻底打垮“三家村”黑帮的猖狂进攻，穷追到底，不获全胜决不收兵！
    在庆功会上，医护人员代表，把写着“学习你一心为公的硬骨头精神，希望你保持光荣，发扬光荣”的镜子赠给张春玉。
