    Fire on the Demons and Monsters
    Luō Shìfā, Representative of the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Xinmin People's Commune Party Committee, Xindu County, Sichuan

    Dèng Tuò viciously attacked the General Line and the Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "wishful thinking," and "replacing reality with fantasy," claiming it "destroyed the entire fortune of even 'a single egg.'" This is entirely speaking from the standpoint of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements.

    I remember in 1958, Dèng Tuò, under the guise of being the editor-in-chief of the *People's Daily*, visited our commune and personally witnessed the vibrant and thriving scene of agricultural production. While visiting the newly built residential area of the Eighth Production Team of the First Brigade, poor peasants Xú Jìyīng and Zēng Jiànmíng personally told him that before liberation, they lived in dilapidated thatched huts with walls open to the wind, enduring the miserable life where "when the windmill turned, tears flowed endlessly"; after liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, their lives were getting better and better. At that time, Dèng Tuò hypocritically acknowledged these facts. But only a few years later, Dèng Tuò, in his *Yanshan Evening Talks*, blatantly told lies, completely distorting the facts. This fully proves his deep-seated hatred for the Party.

    Since communization, our area has undergone earth-shaking changes. In 1965, the average yield per mu of the commune's more than 20,000 mu of cultivated land reached over 900 jin, an increase of more than 45% compared to 1957; the number of pigs also increased from more than 7,000 in 1957 to more than 12,900; the number of tractors increased to 34, and there are also automatic rice and wheat threshers, and so on. Are these many living facts "replacing reality with fantasy" or "bragging"?

    The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune suffered under the oppression of the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism before liberation, never having enough to eat or wear throughout the year. We will never forget that kind of suffering. Take myself as an example, from a very young age, I grazed cattle for landlords, milled rice, and pressed oil, and never wore a cotton coat. Now, that kind of situation is gone forever. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, our lives are getting better and better. I remember during the land reform that year, I was only twenty years old and served as the chairman of the village peasant association. Only the landlord's family had two pairs of leather shoes in the entire village of 168 households, but now every household has rubber shoes. In the past, poor and lower-middle peasants rarely saw milk, but now our commune has established a milk farm, and it is very common for frail elderly people and children to drink milk. Are these all "bragging"?

    The Party, socialism, and the People's Commune are the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants. The more frantically Dèng Tuò and his ilk attack us, the more it proves the greatness and correctness of the Party, and the greatness and correctness of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely do not agree with the slander and vilification of Dèng Tuò and this small handful of demons and monsters, and we resolutely fire on them and struggle against them.

    The exposure of Dèng Tuò and a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements is not a bad thing, but a good thing. This reminds us that it is not enough for poor and lower-middle peasants to only hold hoes and engage in production; we must also actively participate in the Cultural Revolution and take control of the pen. Enemies like Dèng Tuò, who use the pen to carry out destructive activities, are the most cunning and insidious. We shed sweat and produce grain to support them, and after they are full, they wave their pens and ride on our heads to make trouble. This is absolutely not allowed. This incident has taught us that we must drive bourgeois "authorities" like Dèng Tuò off the stage of history, the pen must be held in the hands of the proletariat, and workers, peasants, and soldiers must be the main force of the Cultural Revolution.

    向牛鬼蛇神开火
    全国人民代表大会代表四川新都县新民公社党委书记  罗世发
    邓拓恶毒地攻击总路线、大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“想入非非”、“用空想代替了现实”，把“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”。这完全是站在地富反坏分子立场讲话的。
    记得一九五八年邓拓挂着《人民日报》总编辑的招牌，来我们公社访问，曾亲眼见到农村生产上一片生气蓬勃的景象。他在参观第一大队第八生产队新建的居民点时，贫农徐记英、曾建明亲自告诉他：他们解放前住在四壁通风的烂茅屋里，过着“风车一响，眼泪长淌”的悲惨生活；解放后在毛主席的领导下，生活越来越好了。当时，邓拓假惺惺地承认了这些事实。可是事隔不几年，邓拓却在抛出的《燕山夜话》中睁着眼睛说瞎话，完全歪曲事实。这充分证明了他对党怀有刻骨的仇恨。
    我们这里自从公社化以来，发生了翻天覆地的变化。一九六五年全社二万多亩耕地，平均亩产量达到九百多斤，比一九五七年增产了百分之四十五以上；生猪也由一九五七年的七千多头，发展到一万二千九百多头；拖拉机增加到三十四台，还有自动的稻麦脱粒机等等。这许多活生生的事实，难道都是“用空想代替了现实”，是“吹牛皮”吗？
    我们公社的广大贫下中农，解放前受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山的压迫，一年四季吃不饱，穿不暖。那种痛苦我们永远不会忘记。就拿我来说，从很小起就给地主放牛，碾米，打油，没穿过一件棉衣。现在这种光景一去不复还了。在总路线、大跃进、人民公社的光辉照耀下，我们的生活蒸蒸日上。曾记得土改那年，我才二十岁，当村农会主席，全村一百六十八户人家，只有地主家有两双皮鞋，而今每户人家都有了胶鞋。过去，贫下中农很少见过牛奶，现在我们公社办起了牛奶场，体弱的老人和小孩喝牛奶也是很平常的事，这些难道都是“吹牛皮”吗？
    党、社会主义、人民公社是我们贫下中农的命根子。邓拓之流越是猖狂攻击我们，越是证明党的伟大正确，证明总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大正确。我们贫下中农坚决不答应邓拓这一小撮牛鬼蛇神的诽谤、诬蔑，坚决向他们开火，同他们斗争。
    邓拓等一小撮反党反社会主义分子被揪出来，这并不是一件坏事，而是一件好事。这件事情提醒了我们：贫下中农光拿锄头搞生产不行，还要积极参加文化革命，把笔杆掌管起来。象邓拓这种凭借笔杆子进行破坏活动的敌人，是最狡猾阴险的。我们流着汗，生产出粮食来供养他们，他们吃饱了，却摇着笔杆，骑在我们的头上捣乱，这是绝对不能允许的。这件事教训了我们：必须把邓拓等这类的资产阶级“权威”从历史舞台上赶下去，笔杆子必须掌握在无产阶级手里，由工农兵作文化革命的主力军。
