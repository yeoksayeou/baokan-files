    Poisonous weeds not eradicated, crops won't grow.
    Pests not exterminated, seedlings won't thrive.
    The anti-Party black line must be severed,
    The socialist cultural front must be fortified and secure.
    All demons and monsters must be overthrown,
    The revolutionary red flag will forever flutter in the wind.
    The hearts of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the reddest,
    The revolution leads the charge.
    Grip the guns tightly in our hands,
    Launch a great counterattack.
    Class struggle must not be forgotten,
    Completely uproot the roots of revisionism.
    Hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought,
    The socialist state is secure and firm.

    修正主义根子全拔掉
    战士　杨国珍毒草不除尽，庄稼不长苗。害虫不消灭，禾苗长不好。反党的黑线要斩断，社会主义文化阵地牢又牢。牛鬼蛇神全斗垮，革命红旗永远迎风飘。工农兵心最红，革命打先锋。紧握手中枪，展开大反攻。阶级斗争不能忘，修正主义根子全拔掉。毛泽东思想红旗高高举，社会主义江山牢又牢。
