    *Liberation Army Daily* Editor's Note: From a large number of messages from all over the world, and from the remarks of friends from various countries who have visited our country, we can clearly see that our great leader Chairman Mao is infinitely loved by all revolutionary people in the world. The great Mao Zedong Thought is surging around the world with unparalleled power.

    Revolutionary people of various countries have deeply realized from their own practical struggles that, in this great era of ours, having the great Mao Zedong is the greatest fortune for the oppressed people and oppressed nations. They enthusiastically praise: Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader, the great standard-bearer of the communist movement, Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon of world people's revolution, and a guide for all oppressed people to strive for liberation. They regard Mao Zedong as the Lenin of our time, and enthusiastically shout: "Long live Mao Zedong!"

    Revolutionary people of various countries highly value the mass movement of the Chinese people in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. More and more revolutionaries have expressed that, like the Chinese people, they must master Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their own revolutionary struggles.

    The reason why revolutionary people around the world love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is that Chairman Mao has ingeniously, creatively, and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of our time, a powerful ideological weapon for defeating imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and a universal truth applicable everywhere. With Mao Zedong Thought, the world revolution can succeed; with Mao Zedong Thought, the oppressed and exploited people of the world can stand up and stand up forever. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of revolution, the banner of victory.

    Imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries tremble with fear at the increasingly widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world. They viciously attack Mao Zedong Thought and try every possible means to slander Mao Zedong Thought. In our country, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs also viciously curse Mao Zedong Thought and desperately oppose our workers, peasants, and soldiers in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way. Their desperate opposition does not diminish the great glory of Mao Zedong Thought in the slightest, but further proves the unparalleled greatness and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts, the lifeline of our existence. We infinitely love and are forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Studying Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the bounden duty of every revolutionary fighter. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead bravely. We must pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, forever and forever. Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight them to the end, no matter what monsters and demons, no matter what bourgeois "authorities," we will overthrow them all.

    Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 30th: At the 1966 Budapest International Fair, the great achievements of the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, as displayed in the Chinese Pavilion, have made the broad masses of viewers feel elated and encouraged. Every day, a large number of viewers continue to express their love for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to the Chinese staff in the guestbook or directly, praising the correct line implemented by the Chinese Communist Party. A viewer from Budapest said to the Chinese staff: "The exhibition of the Chinese Pavilion has inspired every true communist." He asked the Chinese staff to convey the "heartfelt congratulations" of the Hungarian people "to Comrade Mao Zedong and all Chinese comrades."

    Viewers expressed unlimited admiration for Chairman Mao's correct leadership. An old painter said: "You are truly engaged in revolution. Mao Zedong's leadership is very correct…Marxist-Leninists all over the world are pinning their hopes on China!" A worker from an instrument manufacturing plant in Budapest said: "In the international communist movement, Comrade Mao Zedong is a leader who consistently upholds the correct line." A university student wrote in the guestbook: "The Chinese Pavilion reflects the great creation and struggle of the Chinese people, and reflects the heroic labor of the Chinese people. The great creation and labor of the Chinese people are carried out under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. We Hungarian communists know that the new achievements of the People's Republic of China have strengthened our common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism."

    Viewers highly praised the inspiring role of China's great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction for the revolutionary people of the world. One person wrote: "The achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction have inspired progressive people and frustrated enemies and modern revisionists." A person in charge of a factory in Budapest said: "We all know that China truly adheres to Marxism-Leninism. It never compromises with any enemy. The Chinese Communist Party not only leads the Chinese people in revolution, but will definitely lead the world revolution well." A farmer said: "We Hungarian farmers are your friends. We are happy to see your achievements as our own." Some people said: "A people with such a high level of creative talent can help the development of peoples who have not yet been liberated and those who have been liberated from oppression in many ways."

    While praising China's great achievements, many people also refuted the various slanders and smears issued by imperialism and modern revisionism against China. One person wrote in the guestbook: "You are advancing on the most beautiful road!" A worker said: "After seeing China's exhibition, it is difficult for people to believe the imperialist slander that the Chinese people are starving." A Hungarian who had been to China said that he had heard a lot of bad things about China before going to China, but what he saw and heard after arriving in China was completely different from what was said here. He said that what impressed him the most was that the Chinese people were very honest and did not lie. When talking about the Soviet revisionist rumors that China was obstructing the transit of aid to Vietnam, he said: "The situation is not like that. We know that China has not obstructed the transit of aid to Vietnam. China has provided a lot of aid to Vietnam, from grain to machines, a lot, a lot." An old farmer who came from the countryside said: "China has everything in terms of grain. The bumper harvests in recent years are the result of the hard work of the Chinese people. After seeing the exhibition, I was surprised that China is a very rich country and not backward at all." Several workers from the Csepel Iron and Steel Works said: "China is developing so fast because of the benefits of self-reliance!"

    Another mechanical engineer said: "The Chinese do not like to brag, but are the most humble and practical...China is now, and will be in the future, the most respected country in the world, and its influence is growing. From the exhibits, it can be seen that it is not China that is bellicose, as some people say, but US imperialism. American planes invade Chinese airspace, and China eats them like dinner. Some countries dare not do this, but just shout weakly a few times." He went on to say: The reason why China is so strong is mainly because of the correctness of the leadership, and secondly because everyone is united like one person.

    Someone wrote in the guestbook: "After seeing your great achievements, I think that the existence of socialist China today is the greatest happiness for progressive mankind in the world, and China is at the forefront of defending world peace." "The brilliant achievements made by the great Chinese people in socialist construction prove that the Chinese Communist Party and its brilliant leader Comrade Mao Zedong are implementing the correct Marxist-Leninist policy." "The creations made by the talented, hardworking and tenacious Chinese people in all aspects are amazing." A retired worker said: "Some people tell us that China is bellicose, and we find it hard to believe. We know that China, with a population of 700 million, is by no means bellicose."

    A Nigerian friend said: "Seeing the Chinese exhibits makes me see even more that the Chinese people have stood up. I am proud of the achievements made by the Chinese people...The African people are actively struggling and will surely stand up like you in the near future." Several Greeks said: "The exhibition hall is very beautiful, but the most beautiful thing is not the exhibition hall, but the political line of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Without Mao Zedong's political line, the exhibition hall would never be so beautiful!"

    广大观众热烈赞扬布达佩斯国际博览会中国馆
    毛泽东同志一贯坚持国际共运正确路线　世界马列主义者把希望寄托在中国身上
    《解放军报》编者按：从来自世界各地的大量消息中，从到我国访问过的各国朋友的言论中，我们清楚地看到，我们的伟大领袖毛主席，受到了全世界一切革命人民的无限热爱。伟大的毛泽东思想正以无比强大的威力磅礴于全世界。
    各国革命的人民从自己的斗争实践中，深切地体会到：在我们这个伟大时代，有了伟大的毛泽东，是被压迫人民和被压迫民族莫大的幸运。他们热情歌颂：毛主席是最伟大的革命领袖，是共产主义运动的伟大旗手，毛泽东思想是世界人民革命的灯塔，是一切被压迫人民争取解放的指针。他们把毛泽东看作当代的列宁，热烈欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
    各国革命人民高度评价中国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。越来越多的革命者表示要象中国人民一样，一定要把毛泽东思想学到手，用毛泽东思想来指导自己的革命斗争。
    全世界革命人民所以热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，是因为毛主席天才地创造性地全面地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的强大思想武器，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。有了毛泽东思想，世界革命就能成功，有了毛泽东思想，全世界被压迫、被剥削的人民就能站起来，永远站起来。伟大的毛泽东思想，是革命的旗帜，胜利的旗帜。
    帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和一切反动派，对毛泽东思想在全世界越来越广泛的传播，害怕得发抖。他们恶毒地攻击毛泽东思想，千方百计地诋毁毛泽东思想。在我们国内，一小撮反党反社会主义黑帮，也恶毒地咒骂毛泽东思想，拚命地反对我们工农兵群众活学活用毛泽东思想。他们这样拚命反对，丝毫无损于毛泽东思想的伟大光辉，而更加证明了毛泽东思想的无比伟大，无比正确。
    毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，是我们的命根子。我们无限热爱和永远忠实于毛泽东思想。学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，是我们每一个革命战士的天职。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗奋勇前进，我们要把毛泽东思想世世代代传下去，永远永远传下去。谁胆敢反对毛泽东思想，我们就和他斗到底，拚到底，不管什么牛鬼蛇神，不管什么资产阶级“权威”，都统统把它打倒。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
                              （原载五月三十日《解放军报》）
    新华社布达佩斯三十日电  在一九六六年布达佩斯国际博览会上，中国馆所显示的中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下取得的伟大成就，使得广大观众感到欢欣鼓舞。每天都继续有大批观众在留言簿上或对中国工作人员表达他们对中国共产党和毛泽东主席的爱戴，赞扬中国共产党执行的正确路线。一位布达佩斯的观众对中国工作人员说：“中国馆的展出鼓舞了我们每一个真正的共产党人”。他要中国工作人员转达匈牙利人民“向毛泽东同志和所有中国同志”的“衷心祝贺”。
    观众们对毛主席的正确领导表示了无限钦佩。一位老油漆工人说：“你们是真正搞革命的，毛泽东的领导是非常正确的，……世界上的马克思列宁主义者都把希望寄托在中国身上啦！”布达佩斯一家仪器制造厂的一位工人说：“在国际共产主义运动中，毛泽东同志是一贯坚持正确路线的领导人。”一名大学生在留言簿上写道：“中国馆反映了中国人民伟大的创造和斗争，反映了中国人民的英勇劳动。中国人民的伟大创造和劳动是在中国共产党和毛泽东同志正确的领导下进行的。我们匈牙利的共产党人知道，中华人民共和国取得的新成就加强了我们共同进行的反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争。”
    观众们高度评价中国在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就对世界革命人民的鼓舞作用。有一个人写道：“中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的成就鼓舞了进步的人民，使敌人和现代修正主义者感到沮丧。”布达佩斯某工厂的一位负责人说：“我们都知道中国是真正地坚持马克思列宁主义的。它从来不向任何敌人妥协。中国共产党不仅领导中国人民搞革命，而且一定会领导好世界革命。”一位农民说：“我们匈牙利农民是你们的朋友。我们高兴地把你们的成就看成是自己的成就。”有的人说：“一个具有如此高水平的创造才能的人民能够在很多方面对还未解放的人民和已经从压迫下解放出来的人民的发展给予帮助。”
    许多人在盛赞中国取得的伟大成就的同时，还驳斥了帝国主义和现代修正主义对中国发出的各种诽谤和诬蔑。有一人在留言簿上写道：“你们是在最美好的道路上前进！”一位工人说：“看了中国的展出后，人们很难相信帝国主义的诬蔑宣传说中国人民在挨饿。”一位曾到过中国的匈牙利人说，他去中国前听到了很多关于中国的坏话，但到中国后的所见所闻完全和这里说的不一样。他说，给他印象最深的是中国人民十分诚实，不说谎。在谈到苏联修正主义造谣中国阻挠援越物资过境时，他说：“情况不是这样的。我们知道，中国没有阻挠援越物资过境，中国给越南的援助很多，从粮食到机器，很多很多。”一位从乡下赶来的老农民说：“中国的粮食应有尽有，近几年的丰收，是中国人民辛勤劳动的结果。看了展览后，使我惊奇，中国是个很富饶的国家，一点也不落后。”切佩尔钢铁厂的几个工人说：“中国发展得这样快，就是自力更生的好处！”
    另一位机械工程师说：“中国人是不喜欢吹嘘的，而是最谦虚、最会实干。……中国现在是、将来更是世界上最受人重视的国家，它的影响愈来愈大。从展品中看出的，不是象有些人说的中国好战，好战的是美帝国主义。美国飞机侵入中国领空，中国象吃晚餐一样把它们吃掉。有些国家不敢这样做，只是有气无力地喊几声。”他接着说：中国之所以强大，主要是领导的正确，其次是大家团结得象一个人一样。
    有人在留言簿上写道：“在看了你们伟大的成绩后，我想，今天社会主义中国的存在，是世界进步人类的最大幸福，中国走在保卫世界和平的前面。”“伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，证明了中国共产党和它的天才领袖毛泽东同志执行着正确的马克思列宁主义政策。”“天才的、勤劳的和顽强的中国人民在各个方面所进行的创造是令人惊异的。”一位退休工人说：“有人对我们说，中国好战，我们很难相信。我们知道拥有七亿人口的中国决不是好战的。”
    一位尼日利亚朋友说：“看到中国的展品，使我更加看到中国人民站起来了，我为中国人民取得的成就而感到骄傲。……非洲人民正在积极斗争，在不久的将来，一定会和你们一样地站起来。”几个希腊人说：“展览馆非常漂亮，但最漂亮的还不是展览馆，而是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东的政治路线。没有毛泽东的政治路线，展览馆决不会这样漂亮！”
