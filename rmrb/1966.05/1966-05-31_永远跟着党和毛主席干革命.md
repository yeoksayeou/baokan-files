    To warn Deng Tuo and his ilk, we will certainly be able to extinguish you few buzzing flies. If you don't believe it, come on! You come one, we will hit one! You come two, we will hit a pair! Come all of you and we will eliminate you all! We will never stop until we have swept away all of you pests.
    National People's Congress Representative, Retired Old Red Army Soldier Gan Zuchang
    After reading the black talk in the "Three-Family Village" black inn, I was very angry and had many things I had to say. The Deng Tuo gang wrote a large number of poisonous weeds filled with slander and attacks on the Party and socialism with their so-called "things they thought, saw, and heard," which is truly hateful to the extreme. I am an old Red Army soldier who has been making revolution with the Party and Chairman Mao since 1927, for a full thirty-eight years. I also want to write down what I have seen, heard, and thought, and fiercely fire at the Deng Tuo anti-Party and anti-socialist gang!

    The Party and Chairman Mao are Most Popular
    The Deng Tuo gang slanders our great Party and Chairman Mao as "untrustworthy" and "unpopular," which is utterly reactionary language! Who doesn't trust the Party and Chairman Mao? It's you, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist demons. Whose hearts are not won? It's just the hearts of you, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist gangs. Let me tell you, we trust the Party and Chairman Mao the most, and they have our hearts the most!
    In 1927, when Chairman Mao led the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops through my hometown—Lianhua County, Jiangxi—he led us to fight local tyrants, distribute land, and explained the revolutionary principles to us, making us understand that only by making revolution with the Party and Chairman Mao could we achieve liberation. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Lianhua started a revolution with a single gun. My fellow villagers and I trusted the Party and Chairman Mao, followed Chairman Mao's troops to Jinggang Mountain, and entrusted our hearts to the revolution. In the fighting years of following the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution, I personally witnessed many moving scenes of the masses loving the Party and Chairman Mao. I need not say much, but just one thing is enough to shatter the slanderous words of Deng Tuo and his ilk against the Party and Chairman Mao. In 1945, our troops marched south from Yan'an to join the Dongjiang guerrillas to fight against Japan. One day in September, the troops arrived at a village in Yongxin County, at the foot of Jinggang Mountain. At first, the villagers mistook us for the Kuomintang army, and every household closed its doors. The soldiers from the north couldn't get the doors open because of language differences. Later, I used the Yongxin dialect to knock on the doors, and the villagers asked me, "What are you doing?" I replied, "I am a soldier of the 17th Division." The 17th Division was established by Chairman Mao himself in Jinggang Mountain and enjoyed a high reputation among the masses. When the villagers heard that I was from the 17th Division, they burst out of their doors, looked at me again and again, and asked repeatedly, "Has Chairman Mao returned?" I said, "He is still in Yan'an." He asked again, "Is Chairman Mao in good health?" I told him that Chairman Mao was leading the people of the whole country to fight against Japan and was in good health. He was extremely happy and shouted throughout the village, "Open the doors quickly, Chairman Mao's 17th Division is back!" When the villagers heard that Chairman Mao's troops had returned, they quickly opened the doors and welcomed our soldiers into their homes, boiled water, cooked food, and asked all sorts of questions. What a moving scene this was! Chairman Mao left here with his troops in 1934. At that time, eleven years had passed, and the masses still remembered Chairman Mao so fondly. How could this be that the Party and Chairman Mao were "untrustworthy" and "unpopular"!
    The Party and Chairman Mao not only enjoy a high reputation in the hearts of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, but also in the hearts of the broad working people throughout China. I have followed the Party and Chairman Mao and traveled almost all over China. Wherever our troops went, they received the support of the masses. In the hail of bullets, the masses led us, sent intelligence, transported supplies, and carried stretchers, vying to do everything. With the support of the masses, our troops grew stronger day by day. When the Jinggang Mountain base area was opened up, our troops had only a few hundred people, but later, they developed into thousands, tens of thousands, and millions. The broad masses of the people regard the Party and Chairman Mao as their saviors and compare them to the red sun in the sky, following the Party and Chairman Mao wholeheartedly. The Party and Chairman Mao have the highest prestige, the greatest power, and are most dear to our hearts. We trust them the most, we trusted them in the past, we trust them now, and we will always trust them in the future. I have followed the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution for most of my life, and in the second half of my life, I will still resolutely follow the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution, and I will also let my children and grandchildren always follow the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution!

    The Great Leap Forward Achieved Great Success
    Deng Tuo and his ilk are like flies crawling out of a latrine, buzzing everywhere, spreading poison everywhere, not only viciously attacking our great Party and Chairman Mao, but also frantically slandering our General Line and the Great Leap Forward. They say we "failed," "collapsed," "bragged," "talked big"... No ivory comes from a dog's mouth! Deng Tuo, I will use facts to teach you bad guys with sores on your heads and pus flowing under your feet!
    In September 1957, I retired from Xinjiang and returned to Lianhua. In the past nine years, I have personally witnessed the people of our old Jinggang Mountain base area, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, achieving one victory after another. This is what you cannot slander.
    Deng Tuo, open your eyes and take a look at the facts in our hometown first! The Yanbei Brigade of the Youlou Commune where I am located is situated in a mountain gully, with very poor natural conditions, high mountains and cold water, and most of the paddy fields are winter water fields. Before liberation, this was a poor place where "sickles hung on the wall, and there was no rice in the pot." The general yield per mu was over a hundred jin, and even in good years, it was only two hundred jin. After liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, all the members of our team, under the brilliant light of the General Line, carried forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, fought against nature, fought against the land, declared war on the drought demon, and demanded grain from the wasteland. After three years of hard work, we opened up more than a hundred drainage ditches, blocked more than five hundred springs, reclaimed more than a hundred mu of red soil, and transformed more than six hundred and eighty mu of winter water fields into high-yield fields for planting double-cropping rice, and the yield per mu leaped from one or two hundred jin to more than seven hundred and fifty jin at once. The commune members said: "In the past, the yield per mu was one basket, now it is more than seven hundred jin per mu. This is truly the greatness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward!" Deng Tuo, open your eyes again and take a look at the facts of farmland water conservancy construction in our entire Lianhua County! Our county is a remote mountainous area. Before liberation, most of the farmland was "looking-at-the-sky hills" lacking water sources. At that time, there was a popular folk song: "Huangtian ridges, Huangtian ridges, dry up the toads and starve the insects; Gu Xiu dikes, Gu Xiu dikes, a big tide washes everything away." After liberation, the Party and the government led the farmers to carry out large-scale water conservancy construction, building dikes, repairing dams, opening canals, and diverting water. Especially after 1958, the achievements in water conservancy construction in the county were even greater, building 119 large and small reservoirs, 450 water dikes, 541 water ditches, and 1,245 water ponds. Now, in every mountain gully and mountain col in the county, clear water flows everywhere. Most of the more than 200,000 mu of farmland have solved the problem of water shortage, and the output has greatly increased. Deng Tuo, take a look at the ironclad facts, listen to the voices of the people of Jinggang Mountain, and think with your head propped up by bricks: Did the General Line and the Great Leap Forward fail? Can these great achievements be achieved by "bragging"? Facts prove that it is not us who have failed, but you, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist demons!
    Deng Tuo and his ilk's hatred for us cannot harm a single hair on our heads, but can only further expose their counter-revolutionary faces. Deng Tuo, we solemnly warn you! The people of our old revolutionary base areas know how to fight for the country and also know how to defend our country. Yesterday we could defeat the vicious American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and today we will certainly be able to extinguish you few buzzing flies. If you don't believe it, come on! You come one, we will hit one! You come two, we will hit a pair! Come all of you and we will eliminate you all! No matter if you are big flies or small flies, no matter if you are green-headed flies or red-headed flies, we will never stop until we have swept away all of you pests.

    Deng Tuo's "Peaceful Evolution" Conspiracy Will Never Succeed
    Deng Tuo and his gang of poisonous snakes know that young people are eager to learn and improve, and have a strong desire for knowledge, but lack experience in class struggle. Therefore, they hung up the banners of "transmitting knowledge," "telling stories," and "discussing history," put on a face of caring for young people, and peddled black goods that corrode and poison young people, vainly trying to drag young people into their "Three-Family Village" black inn to realize the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution." Deng Tuo, let me tell you, revolutionary youth will never be fooled by you, and we older generation of revolutionaries will never let them be fooled. Your conspiracy will never succeed!
    We older generation of revolutionaries deeply know that revolutionary fruits are not easy to come by. Therefore, we know what kind of path to educate our descendants to take, and we also know how to fulfill our responsibility to cultivate and educate the younger generation.
    My whole family has seventeen children (including my sons, nephews, and grandchildren). Every one of our children listens to the Party and Chairman Mao. In 1951, not long after Xinjiang was liberated, my eldest son came from my hometown of Lianhua to Xinjiang and asked to study. Seeing that he was a bit older, I sent him to learn blacksmithing. At first, he was unwilling, but I told him: "The purpose of our revolution is to serve the people, and blacksmithing is also serving the people. As long as it is labor, it is glorious." Later, he went to learn blacksmithing and became a good blacksmith. In 1957, I retired and returned home, and I organized all the children in my family, gave each of them a sickle and a manure basket, and asked them to pick up wild manure and cut pig grass every day. Later, I bought several handcarts, and every Sunday I asked them to push coal at the Shilong Coal Mine. At that time, some kind-hearted people advised me not to be so strict with my children. I said to them: "This is not a matter of picking up a little manure, cutting a little grass, or pushing a little coal, but a matter of cultivating what kind of revolutionary successors. To make our next generation never deteriorate and not squander our revolutionary fruits, we must make them take the same path as the working people from an early age." In the past nine years, my children have been walking along this path. They said to me: "We must always advance along the road pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao and be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause."
    In addition to educating my own children and letting them take over the revolutionary class, I often tell revolutionary traditions to young people in and out of the village, in and out of the county, and encourage them to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the Communist Party, and be good revolutionary successors. Although doing so takes up some of my time, I feel that this is my responsibility. Deng Tuo and his ilk are now engaged in the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution," which makes me feel that my responsibility is even greater. I will do a better job of cultivating revolutionary descendants in the future and let them inherit and pass on the revolutionary traditions of our older generation.
    In recent years, knowledge youth from all over the country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao to go to the countryside, go to the border areas, and go to the crucible of the three great revolutionary movements to temper themselves. Seeing this revolutionary action of the young people, I am happy from the bottom of my heart. Dozens of young people in the Gaozhou Forestry Farm in our Lianhua County are all knowledge youth from Ji'an City. After two years of labor training, they have tanned their skin, tempered their thoughts, and are not afraid of being tired or suffering. These eighteen- and nineteen-year-old young men and women are proficient in plowing fields, hoeing the ground, and threshing rice. They have learned everything. This generation of young people has not disappointed the expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao. We older generation of revolutionaries can also feel at ease with such successors.

    Deng Tuo, let me ask you: What kind of "stories" did you tell the young people? What kind of "history" did you tell? What kind of "knowledge" did you impart? The stories you tell are anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds; the history you tell is to complain and cry injustice for emperors, generals, and landlord bourgeoisie; the knowledge you impart is to corrupt our young people to eat, drink, and have fun. It's really all mud scooped up from the pond, and all feces dug out of the cesspool. Deng Tuo, let me tell you: Our proletarian descendants are going to study, that is, to read Chairman Mao's books; our young people should understand history, and what they should understand is the history of the working people; our young people hope to "become famous," that is, to become proletarian revolutionaries. You, a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist ambitious wolves, will not get what you want from our older generation of revolutionaries, and you will never get it from our next generation, never!

    Thoroughly Smash the "Three-Family Village"
    Chairman Mao taught us: "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all demons and monsters, should be criticized and must not be allowed to run rampant freely." I have followed the Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution for thirty-eight years. Whether it was during the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, or the Liberation War, I have never violated Chairman Mao's teachings. Wherever Chairman Mao pointed, I fought there, until the enemy surrendered their weapons. Today, Deng Tuo, this small handful of class enemies without guns, has emerged, and I resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and thoroughly overthrow them. In the past, we could defeat the enemy with guns, and now we will certainly be able to eliminate the enemy without guns!
    Although I am retired at home, my thoughts have not retired, and my revolutionary will is forever strong. Closely follow the Party and Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village," and overthrow all demons and monsters. This is my will and determination!

### 永远跟着党和毛主席干革命

    永远跟着党和毛主席干革命
    正告邓拓之流，我们一定能扑灭你们这几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇。不信，你们就来吧！你们来一只，我们打一只！你们来两只，我们就打一双！全部来就全部消灭！不扫尽你们这些害人虫，我们决不收兵
    全国人民代表大会代表、退休老红军　甘祖昌
    看了“三家村”黑店里的黑话，我非常气愤，心里有许多话非说不可。邓拓黑帮把他们所谓“想到的，看到的，听到的东西”写了一大批诬蔑攻击党和社会主义的毒草，真是可恨到了极点。我是一个老红军战士，从一九二七年跟着党和毛主席干革命，整整三十八年。我也要把我所看到的，听到的，想到的东西写下来，向邓拓一小撮反党反社会主义的黑帮猛烈开火！
    党和毛主席最得人心
    邓拓黑帮诬蔑我们伟大的党和毛主席“不堪信任”，“不得人心”，这是十足的反革命语言！是谁不信任党和毛主席？是你们那一小撮反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神。是不得谁的心？只不过是不得你们那一小撮反党反社会主义黑帮的心。告诉你们，党和毛主席我们最信任，最得我们的心！
    一九二七年，毛主席带领秋收起义的队伍经过我的家乡——江西莲花县时，领导我们打土豪分田地，给我们讲革命道理，使我们懂得了只有跟着党和毛主席闹革命，才能得翻身。于是，我们莲花人民在党的领导下，用一杆枪闹起了革命。我和老乡们信得过党和毛主席，跟着毛主席的队伍上了井冈山，把自己的心交给了革命。在跟随党和毛主席干革命的战斗岁月里，我亲眼看到许多群众热爱党、热爱毛主席的动人情景，不用多说，只说一件就足以粉碎邓拓之流诬蔑党和毛主席的谰言。一九四五年，我们的部队从延安南下与东江游击队会合打日本。九月的一天，部队开到井冈山下永新县的一个村庄。起初，老乡把我们错当成国民党的军队，家家关门闭户。北方来的战士因语言关系叫不开门，后来我操着永新腔去叫门，老乡问我：“你是干什么的？”我回答：“我是十七师的战士。”十七师是毛主席当年在井冈山亲手建立的，在群众中享有崇高的威望。老乡听说我是十七师的，破门而出，拉着我看了又看，连声问道：“毛主席回来了没有？”我说：“他还在延安。”他又问：“毛主席的身体可好？”我告诉他毛主席在领导全国人民打日本，身体很好。他高兴的不得了，在全村高喊：“快开门呀，毛主席的十七师回来了！”老乡们听说是毛主席的队伍回来了，赶紧开门把我们的战士迎进屋里，烧水煮饭，问长问短。这是一幅多么动人的情景啊！毛主席是一九三四年带着队伍离开这里的，当时时隔十一年，群众还那样念念不忘毛主席，这难道是党和毛主席“不堪信任”“不得人心”吗！
    党和毛主席不仅在革命老根据地人民的心目中享有崇高的威望，在全中国广大劳动人民的心目中也一样。我跟随党和毛主席差不多跑遍了整个中国，我们的队伍开到哪里，就得到哪里的群众的拥护和支持。在枪林弹雨里，群众给我们带路、送情报、运输、抬担架，样样活儿争着干。在群众的支持下，我们的队伍也一天天壮大起来。开辟井冈山根据地的时候，我们的队伍只有几百人，可是到后来，发展到几千人、几万人、几百万人。广大人民把党和毛主席当做自己的救命恩人，比做天上的红太阳，一个心眼跟着党和毛主席走。党和毛主席的威信最高，威力最大，最得我们的心，我们最信任，过去信任，现在信任，将来永远信任。我跟着党和毛主席干了大半辈子革命，后半辈子我仍然坚决跟着党和毛主席干革命，我还要让我的子孙永远跟着党和毛主席干革命！
    大跃进成绩伟大
    邓拓之流就象茅坑里爬上来的苍蝇，到处嗡叫，到处放毒，不仅恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党和毛主席，还疯狂地诬蔑我们的总路线、大跃进。他们说我们“失败”了“垮台”了，是“吹牛皮”“说大话”……狗嘴里长不出象牙！邓拓，我要用事实好好教训教训你们这些头顶上长疮脚底下流脓的坏家伙！
    一九五七年九月我从新疆退休回到莲花。九年来，我亲眼看到我们井冈山老根据地人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社红旗，取得的一个又一个的胜利。这是你们诬蔑不了的。
    邓拓，睁开你的两眼先看看我们家乡的事实！我所在的圩楼公社沿背大队，座落在一个山沟里，自然条件很差，山高水冷，大部分稻田是冬水田。解放前，这里是一个“镰刀挂上壁，锅里没饭吃”的穷地方，一般亩产一百多斤，好年成也只有两百来斤。解放以后，特别是一九五八年大跃进以来，我们全队社员在总路线的光辉照耀下，发扬革命老根据地人民艰苦创业精神，与天奋斗，与地奋斗，向旱魔开战，向荒地要粮。我们苦战三年，开了一百多条排水沟，堵死了五百多个泉眼，开垦了一百多亩红壤土，把六百八十多亩冬水田，改造成种双季稻的高产田，亩产由一两百斤，一下子跃进到七百五十多斤。社员说：“过去是亩产收一箩，现在是亩产七百多，这真是共产党毛主席伟大，大跃进成绩大呀！”邓拓，再睁开你的两眼看看我们莲花全县农田水利建设的事实！我们县是个偏僻的山区。解放前，大部分农田是水源缺乏的“望天丘”，当时流传着这样一首歌谣：“黄天垄，黄天垄，干死蛤蟆饿死虫；谷修陂，谷修陂，一潮大水光哩哩。”解放以后，党和政府领导农民大搞水利建设，筑堤修坝，开渠引水，特别是一九五八年以后，全县水利建设成绩更大，修建起大、小水库一百一十九个，水陂四百五十座，水圳五百四十一条，水塘一千二百四十五口。现在，全县每一个山冲山坳，到处是清水长流，二十多万亩农田，绝大部分解决了缺水的问题，产量大大提高。邓拓，你看一看铁一般的事实，你听一听井冈山人民的声音，拿起砖头垫起脑袋想一想：总路线、大跃进失败了吗？这些伟大的成绩靠“吹牛皮”能吹出来吗？事实证明，失败了的不是我们，而是你们这一小撮反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神！
    邓拓之流如此仇视我们，损害不了我们一根毫毛，只能进一步暴露他们的反革命嘴脸。邓拓，我们正告你！我们革命老根据地的人民知道怎样去打江山，也知道怎样去保卫我们的江山。昨天我们能打败穷凶极恶的美帝国主义和国民党反动派，今天也一定能扑灭你们这几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇。不信，你们就来吧！你们来一只，我们就打一只！你们来两只，我们就打一双！全部来就全部消灭！不管你是大苍蝇，还是小苍蝇，也不管你是绿头苍蝇，还是红头苍蝇，不扫尽你们这些害人虫，我们决不收兵。
    邓拓的“和平演变”阴谋休想得逞
    邓拓这伙毒蛇深知青年人好学上进，求知心强，但又缺乏阶级斗争经验，于是他们挂起了“传知识”、“讲故事”、“谈历史”的招牌，摆出了一副关心青年的面孔，贩卖腐蚀毒害青年的黑货，妄想把青年拉进他们的“三家村”黑店里去，实现“和平演变”的阴谋。邓拓，告诉你，革命的青年决不会上你们的当，我们老一辈革命者也绝不会让他们去上当，你们的阴谋休想得逞！
    我们老一辈革命者深知革命果实来之不易，因此，我们懂得教育我们的后代走什么样的路，我们也知道如何尽到我们培养教育青年一代的责任。
    我全家有十七个孩子（包括我的儿子、侄子、孙子）。我们的孩子个个都听党和毛主席的话。一九五一年，新疆解放不久，我的大儿子从莲花老家来到新疆要求读书。我看到他年龄大了一些，于是就把他送去学打铁。起初他不愿意，我告诉他：“我们革命的目的是为人民服务，打铁也是为人民服务。只要是劳动，都是光荣的。”他后来就去学打铁了，成为一个好铁匠了。一九五七年我退休回家，就把我家的孩子都组织起来，每人发给一把镰刀，一只粪筐，每天要他们去拣野粪、割猪草。后来，我又买了几辆手推车，每逢星期日要他们去时垄煤矿推煤炭。当时，有些好心人劝我别对孩子这么严，我对他们说：“这不是拣一点粪，割一点草、推一点煤的问题，而是关系到培养什么样的革命接班人的大事。要使我们的下一代永不变质，不糟践掉我们的革命果实，就必须使他们从小和劳动人民走一条道。”九年来，我的孩子正是朝着这条道走的，他们对我说：“我们要永远朝着党和毛主席指引的道路前进，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    我除了教育自己的孩子，让他们接好革命的班外，还经常给村里、村外，县里、县外的青少年讲革命传统，勉励他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，当好革命接班人。这样做，虽然占了我一些时间，但我觉得这是我应尽的责任。邓拓之流现在搞“和平演变”的阴谋，使我感到自己肩上的责任更加重大，我今后要更加把培养革命后代的工作做好，让他们把我们老一辈的革命传统接过去，传下去。
    近几年来，全国各地的知识青年，热烈响应党和毛主席的号召，到农村去，到边疆去，到三大革命运动的熔炉中去锻炼自己。看到青年们的这种革命行动，我从心底里欢喜。我们莲花县高洲林场的几十个青年人都是吉安市来的知识青年，他们经过两年的劳动锻炼，晒黑了皮肤，炼红了思想，不怕累、不怕苦。这些十八九岁的男女青年，耕田、锄地，打禾门门在行，样样都学会了。这一代青年人没有辜负党和毛主席的期望，我们老一辈革命者能有这样的接班人，也感到放心。
    邓拓，我要问问你：你给青年人讲的是什么“故事”？讲的是什么“历史”？传授的是什么“知识”？你讲的故事，是反党反社会主义的毒草；你讲的历史，是为帝王将相、地主资产阶级鸣屈叫冤；你传授的知识，是腐蚀我们的青年去吃喝玩乐。这真是水塘里捞上的尽是泥，粪坑里掏出来尽是屎。邓拓，我告诉你：我们无产阶级的后代是要读书的，那就是要读毛主席的书；我们的青年是应该懂历史的，他们懂得的应是劳动人民的历史；我们的青年是希望“成名成家”的，那就是成为无产阶级的革命家。你们这一小撮反党反社会主义的野心狼，在我们老一辈革命者身上得不到的东西，也休想在我们下一代身上得到，永远都得不到！
     彻底捣毁“三家村”
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”我跟随党和毛主席干革命三十八年，无论是土地革命时期，抗日战争时期，还是解放战争时期，从未违背过毛主席的教导，毛主席指向那里，我就打向那里，直打得敌人缴了械，投了降。今天，邓拓这一小撮不拿枪的阶级敌人出笼了，我坚决听毛主席的话，把他们彻底打倒。过去我们能把拿枪的敌人打倒，现在也一定能把不拿枪的敌人消灭！
    我虽然退休在家，但我的思想却没有退休，革命意志永远旺盛。紧跟党和毛主席，彻底捣毁“三家村”，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，这就是我的意志和决心！
