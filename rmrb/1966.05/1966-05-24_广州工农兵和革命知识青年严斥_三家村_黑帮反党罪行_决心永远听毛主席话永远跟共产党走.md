    Amidst the high tide of the socialist cultural revolution, Guangzhou workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals have been holding discussions and writing articles, severely condemning the towering crimes of the "Three-Family Village" gang for opposing the Party and socialism. With profound class feelings, they said: "Chairman Mao is the most beloved, and the Communist Party is the most popular; we must always listen to Chairman Mao's words and always follow the Communist Party."

    Chairman Mao is our great savior, and the Communist Party is the sun in our hearts

    He Zeng, a Guangzhou model worker and worker at the Guangzhou Port Authority, said at a discussion: The Deng Tuo gang wants the Communist Party to step down, which means they want our working class to step down; they want the Communist Party not to speak, which means they want our working class not to speak; they want the Communist Party to do nothing, which means they want our working class not to make revolution. This is absolutely impossible! The great Communist Party of China leads our working class and the people of the whole country, and we must carry the revolution through to the end!

    Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Deng Tuo viciously slanders our Party as "unpopular," which is exactly the tune used by imperialism and revisionism to attack us. Who is the savior of the people, and who is the mortal enemy of the people, our working class knows best. In the old society, our dockworkers suffered the oppression and exploitation of the "three great mountains." A single bamboo pole pressed us down so that we couldn't straighten our backs. We went from being strong to being weak, and finally we had to beg for food. After liberation, we dockworkers were liberated from the abyss of suffering. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are heart-to-heart with us working people, and we are connected to the Party by flesh and blood. Deng Tuo viciously attacks the Party, attempting to sow discord between us working people and the Party, which is simply a dream!

    Xu Shouqi, instructor of the "Maritime Vanguard Boat," said in an article: The glorious Communist Party of China is the savior of the Chinese people and the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. History proves: If it were not for the great Communist Party of China, could the Chinese people have been liberated from the oppression of the "three great mountains"? Could the Chinese people, who have been enslaved and oppressed for hundreds and thousands of years, be able to stand tall before imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries today and wage a resolute struggle against them? The glorious, great, and correct Communist Party of China is not only warmly supported by the people of the whole country, but also enthusiastically praised by the revolutionary people of the world. They regard the Communist Party of China as the hope of the world revolution.

    The Deng Tuo gang attacks our Party as "unworthy of trust," arrogantly demanding that our Party step down quickly to "rest." They are singing the same tune as imperialism and modern revisionism, trying to remove the red sun in our hearts and make China take the capitalist road. We solemnly declare: The great Communist Party of China is the red sun in our hearts, and whoever tries to remove the red sun in our hearts, we will wage a resolute struggle against them!

    Attacking the Party and Chairman Mao is attacking all working people

    Wang Cai, a national "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetter, Guangzhou People's Representative, and waiter at the Liwan Hotel, said at a discussion: The Party rescued us from the fire pit, the Party loves us the most, and also trusts us the most. In the old society, I had fourteen brothers and sisters, a family of sixteen people. By the time of liberation, fifteen people had been tortured to death by landlords and bullies. When I was twelve years old, I ran from the countryside to Guangzhou to work as a child laborer, living a life worse than animals. Only because of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I am now the master of my own house, a Guangzhou People's Representative, and have even gone to Beijing to attend meetings and discuss state affairs with national leaders. The Deng Tuo gang wants to drive our Party out of power, which means they want the landlords and capitalists to come to power, so that the "three great mountains" can oppress us again. We resolutely disagree! We working people love the Party the most, love Chairman Mao the most, we must always listen to Chairman Mao's words and always follow the Communist Party.

    Lu Ping, captain of the Nanhai 155 ship of the Guangzhou Maritime Administration, a national Daqing-style advanced unit, said at a discussion: Our maritime workers have traveled to many places in the world and have personally seen the extremely high prestige of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party of China among the revolutionary people of the world. We have seen many exciting things in foreign ports. Some foreign friends affectionately stroke our five-star red flag, expressing their respect for the People's Republic of China; some people gaze at Chairman Mao's portrait for a long time, expressing their infinite love; some people, as soon as they hear us speak Chinese, happily give a thumbs up and shout "Mao Zedong." Some people ask us for Chairman Mao's works again and again, saying, "To get a copy of Chairman Mao's works is the greatest happiness." Why is this? Because Chairman Mao pointed out the direction of revolution for the people of the world, because the Communist Party of China firmly supports the revolutions of the people of all countries and supports the people of the world in striving for emancipation and liberation. Deng Tuo, this handful of "Three-Family Village" reactionary fellows, dared to shamelessly slander our great Party and Chairman Mao. To tell you the truth, whoever opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought is the irreconcilable enemy of our working class and all the Chinese people.

    Fang Shilin, a veteran worker of the Hong Kong Seamen's Strike and a trade union cadre of the Guangzhou Maritime Administration, said at a discussion: I am a maritime worker and participated in the Hong Kong Seamen's Strike. I understand that if the working class wants to stand up, it must always follow the Party and fight against all kinds of class enemies. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and carried out a bloody massacre. I still clearly remember that many Communist Party members and revolutionary people shouted "Long live the Communist Party of China!" heroically when they were martyred at Wuyan Bridge. Our current regime was won with the blood and lives of countless martyrs. We must firmly grasp the seal of power that was exchanged for the blood of the martyrs in our hands. The "Three-Family Village" gang wants the Communist Party to step down, that is wishful thinking! Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The facts of more than ten years of liberation prove that as long as we master Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how cunning the demons and monsters are, they cannot escape our grasp.

    Listen to the Party and resolutely take the socialist road

    He Xingchan, chairman of the Poor Peasants Association of Tangyong Brigade, Sanyuanli Commune, Guangzhou Suburbs, said in an article: The Deng Tuo gang tried to arouse the masses' dissatisfaction with the Party, so that the "Three-Family Village"'s anti-Party and anti-socialist ambitious people could seize leadership. We want to warn Deng Tuo: Don't daydream. The Party and the masses of the people are closely linked. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to the Party the most and are most determined to take the socialist road. We will never be fooled by you!

    I was a maid in the old society, and my father was killed in the old society. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to make liberation and rescued us poor and lower-middle peasants from the eighteenth layer of hell, and we became masters of our own affairs. The Party and Chairman Mao led us to take the socialist road of common prosperity and led us to carry the revolution through to the end. Without the Communist Party, there would be no happiness for our people today. When we poor and lower-middle peasants think of the past suffering, we will never forget the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao, and we must always follow the Party.

    Huang Zhaoxia, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Zhongluotan Commune, Guangzhou Suburbs, said in an article: Deng Tuo and his gang's vicious attacks on our Party made us particularly angry. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for building socialism, and it is the fundamental guarantee for us to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end. Before liberation, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our Yu Bei area suffered all kinds of oppression and exploitation from the landlords. They worked hard for a year but could not get enough to eat, and countless people fled from famine and starved to death. At that time, a small drought would occur here if it didn't rain for three days, and a large drought would occur if it didn't rain for seven days. Too much rain would cause waterlogging. Natural and man-made disasters made it impossible for our poor and lower-middle peasants to survive. The Communist Party came and rescued us from the abyss of suffering. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, we have been exerting great efforts and striving for upstream, building sixteen large and small reservoirs, eleven kilometers of the Liuxi River irrigation canal, twelve electric pumping stations, one drainage station, and two flood control dikes, fundamentally changing the past situation of drought and waterlogging. In the great drought of 1963, our commune not only did not reduce production, but increased production. Now, the average yield per mu of rice in our commune has reached more than 900 jin, more than double the pre-Great Leap Forward yield. The development of production has made the lives of commune members better and better. The vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants know that today's good life was brought by the Party and Chairman Mao. We resolutely follow the Party and Chairman Mao, and better days are ahead.

    广州工农兵和革命知识青年严斥“三家村”黑帮反党罪行
    决心永远听毛主席话永远跟共产党走
    广州工农兵和革命知识青年在社会主义文化大革命高潮中，纷纷座谈、写稿，严厉斥责“三家村”黑帮反党反社会主义的滔天罪行。他们怀着无比深厚的阶级感情说：“毛主席最受敬爱，共产党最得人心；我们要永远听毛主席的话，永远跟着共产党走。”
    毛主席是我们的大救星，共产党是我们心中的太阳
    广州市五好职工、广州港务局工人何增在座谈会上说：邓拓黑帮要共产党下台，就是要我们工人阶级下台；要共产党不要讲话，就是要我们工人阶级不要讲话；要共产党什么都不要做，就是要我们工人阶级不要革命。这绝对办不到！伟大的中国共产党领导我们工人阶级和全国人民，一定要将革命进行到底！
    没有共产党，就没有新中国。邓拓恶毒地污蔑我们党“不得人心”，这完全是帝国主义、修正主义攻击我们的腔调。谁是人民的救星，谁是人民的死敌，我们工人阶级最清楚。在旧社会，我们码头工人受尽了“三座大山”的压迫和剥削。一条竹杠把我们压得直不起腰来，从有力干到无力，最后只好讨饭。解放后，我们码头工人才从苦难的深渊中解放出来。共产党和毛主席同我们劳动人民心贴心，我们和党血肉相连。邓拓恶毒地攻击党，妄图挑拨我们劳动人民和党的关系，简直是作梦！
    “海上先锋艇”指导员徐寿祺在文章中说：光荣的中国共产党，是中国人民的救星，是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。历史证明：要是没有伟大的中国共产党，中国人民能从“三座大山”的压迫下解放出来吗？几百年、几千年受奴役、受压迫的中国人民，今天能够在帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派面前扬眉吐气，并同它们进行坚决的斗争吗？光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党，不仅受到全国人民的热烈拥护，还受到世界革命人民的热情赞颂。他们把中国共产党看成是世界革命的希望。
    邓拓黑帮攻击我们党“不堪信任”，狂妄地要我们党赶快下台“休息”。他们和帝国主义、现代修正主义唱的是一个调子，妄想摘下我们心中的红太阳，使中国走资本主义的黑路。我们庄严地宣告：伟大的中国共产党，是我们心中的红太阳，谁妄想摘掉我们心中的红太阳，我们就同它进行坚决的斗争！
    攻击党和毛主席，就是攻击全体劳动人民
    全国“三八”红旗手、广州市人民代表、荔湾酒店服务员王才在座谈会上说：党把我们从火坑里救出来，党最爱护我们，也最相信我们。在旧社会，我有十四个兄弟姐妹，全家十六口人，到解放的时候，十五人被地主、恶霸活活折磨死了。我十二岁那年，从农村跑到广州做童工，过着牛马不如的生活。只因为有了共产党和毛主席，我今天才当家作了主人，当上广州市人民代表，还到北京去开会，和国家领导人一起商量国家大事。邓拓黑帮要赶我们党下台，就是要让地主资本家上台，好让“三座大山”再压在我们头上，我们坚决不答应！我们劳动人民最热爱党，最热爱毛主席，我们要永远听毛主席的话，永远跟着共产党走。
    全国大庆式先进单位、广州海运管理局南海一五五轮船长鲁萍在座谈会上说：我们海员工人走过世界上许多地方，亲眼看到我们伟大的领袖毛主席和伟大的中国共产党，在全世界革命人民中有极高的威信。我们在外国港口，看到许许多多激动人心的事情。有的外国朋友深情地抚摸着我们的五星红旗，表示他们对中华人民共和国的尊敬；有的人久久地凝视着毛主席象，表达他们的无限敬爱；有的人一听到我们讲中国话，就高兴得举起大拇指，高喊“毛泽东”。有的人一次又一次地跟我们要毛主席著作，他们说：“得到一本毛主席著作，就是最大的幸福。”这是为什么？因为毛主席给世界人民指出了革命的方向，因为中国共产党坚决支持各国人民革命，支持世界人民争取翻身、解放。邓拓这一小撮“三家村”反动家伙，竟敢对我们伟大的党和毛主席进行无耻的污蔑。老实告诉你们，谁要反党反社会主义，反对毛泽东思想，谁就是我们工人阶级和全中国人民不共戴天的敌人。
    省港大罢工老工人、广州市海运管理局工会干部方世林在座谈会上说：我是个海员工人，参加过省港大罢工。我懂得工人阶级要翻身，就要永远跟着党走，向各式各样的阶级敌人作斗争。一九二七年，蒋介石背叛革命，进行血腥屠杀。我还清楚地记得，许多共产党员、革命人民在五眼桥英勇就义的时候，高呼“中国共产党万岁！”我们今天的政权，是无数先烈抛头颅、洒热血换得来的。用烈士们的鲜血换来的印把子，我们一定要牢牢掌握在手里。“三家村”黑帮要共产党下台，那是妄想！毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。解放十几年的事实证明，只要我们掌握了毛泽东思想，牛鬼蛇神再狡猾，也逃不出我们的手掌心。
    听党的话，坚决走社会主义道路
    广州郊区三元里公社棠涌大队贫协主席何杏婵在文章里说：邓拓黑帮企图挑起群众对党的不满，好让“三家村”的反党反社会主义野心家夺取领导权。我们要警告邓拓：你们不要痴心妄想。党和人民群众是亲密无间的，我们贫下中农最听党的话，走社会主义道路最坚决，绝不会上你们的当！
    我在旧社会是个婢女，我的父亲是在旧社会被害死的。共产党和毛主席领导我们闹解放，把我们贫下中农从十八层地狱中搭救出来，翻身做了主人。党和毛主席领导我们走共同富裕的社会主义道路，领导我们把革命进行到底。没有共产党，就没有我们人民今天的幸福。我们贫下中农一想起过去的苦难，就永远不会忘记党和毛主席的恩情，就要永远跟着党走。
    广州市郊钟落潭公社党委副书记黄兆霞在文章中说：邓拓一伙对我们党的恶毒攻击，使我们特别愤怒。党的领导是建设社会主义的根本保证，是我们把中国革命和世界革命进行到底的根本保证。解放前，我们禺北地区的贫下中农受尽地主的压迫剥削，一年辛劳，不得温饱，逃荒、饿死的人不知多少。那时候，我们这里三天不雨小旱，七天不雨大旱，雨下多了又涝，天灾人祸使我们贫下中农无法活下去。共产党来了，把我们从水深火热中拯救了出来。大跃进以来，我们在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，鼓足干劲、力争上游，修了大小山塘水库十六个，流溪河灌溉渠十一公里，电动排灌站十二个，排涝站一个，防洪堤二条，根本改变了过去不旱即涝的面貌。一九六三年大旱，我们公社不但没有减产，反而增了产。现在，我们公社的水稻，平均亩产量达到九百多斤，比大跃进前增加了一倍多。生产的发展，使社员生活越来越好。广大贫下中农都知道，今天的好日子是党和毛主席带来的，我们坚决跟着党和毛主席走，更好的日子还在前头。
