    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 28th - Baron Anton Hala, Chairman of the Belgian Action for Peace and Independence of All Peoples and the Belgian Committee for Solidarity with the South Vietnamese People, told our reporter here that the main enemy of the world peace movement today is American imperialism. To defend world peace, we must first oppose American imperialism.
    He said that today, American imperialism, like Hitler's fascist Germany in the past, uses anti-communism as an excuse to carry out aggression everywhere, with the aim of dominating the entire world. He pointed out that American imperialism regards China as its number one enemy because China has adopted a correct stand and played a significant role in the struggle to defend world peace. He said that in order to oppose American imperialism and defend world peace, people all over the world must stand on China's side. As long as the people of the world persist in their struggle, they will surely achieve victory.
    Baron Hala condemned American imperialism's burning, killing, and looting in Vietnam, just like the fascist Hitler did in the past. He emphasized: "The only way to solve the Vietnam problem is for the United States to withdraw all its aggressor troops from South Vietnam." He exposed the so-called "peace talks" conspiracy of American imperialism on the Vietnam issue, saying that the Vietnam problem can never be resolved through so-called "peace talks." Anyone who advocates so-called "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue is a traitor. He expressed his firm belief that American imperialism will never win in Vietnam, and final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people.
    Baron Hala condemned the Soviet leadership group's actions in undermining the world peace movement. He said that the Soviet leadership group uses deceptive and foolish methods to try to obstruct the world's people from fighting against American imperialism. The Soviet leadership group says that the world's people's anti-imperialist struggle will lead to a nuclear war, but history has given them the opposite answer. The anti-American struggles of the Korean and Vietnamese people have not caused a nuclear war.
    Speaking about his impressions of visiting China, he said that he saw that the Chinese people are working hard and consciously, using their own hands to build their motherland diligently. He said that the Chinese people are very humble, live very frugally, and are full of confidence in their leaders.

    比利时阿拉男爵在广州发表谈话
    为了保卫和平，必须站在中国一边
    中国人民自觉地工作，对自己的领导人充满着信心
    新华社广州二十八日电  比利时争取和平与各国人民独立行动和比利时声援越南南方人民委员会主席安东·阿拉男爵在这里对本社记者说，当前世界和平运动中的主要敌人是美国帝国主义。要保卫世界和平，首先必须反对美帝国主义。
    他说，今天美帝国主义同过去的希特勒法西斯德国一样，以反对共产主义为借口，到处进行侵略，其目的是想统治全世界。他指出，美帝国主义把中国作为它的头号敌人，因为中国在保卫世界和平的斗争中采取了正确的立场，并起了很大的作用。他说，为了反对美帝国主义，保卫世界和平，全世界人民必须站在中国这一边。只要全世界人民坚持斗争，一定会取得胜利。
    阿拉男爵谴责美帝国主义在越南的烧杀抢掠，同当年法西斯希特勒一样。他强调指出：“解决越南问题的唯一出路是，美国必须从南越撤出它的全部侵略军。”他揭露美帝国主义在越南问题上搞的所谓“和谈”阴谋，他说，越南问题绝不能通过所谓“和谈”来解决。谁要是在越南问题上主张所谓“和谈”，谁就是叛徒。他表示坚信，美帝国主义在越南绝不能取胜，最后胜利一定属于越南人民。
    阿拉男爵谴责苏联领导集团破坏世界和平运动的行径。他说，苏联领导集团用欺骗和愚弄人民的手法，企图阻挠世界人民进行反对美帝国主义的斗争。苏联领导集团说什么世界人民反帝斗争会导致一场核战争，但是历史已给了他们相反的回答，朝鲜人民和越南人民的反美斗争并没有引起一场核战争。
    他谈到访问中国的观感时说，他看到了中国人民都在努力地、自觉地工作，他们用自己的双手在辛勤地建设祖国。他说，中国人民很谦虚，生活很俭朴，他们对自己的领导人充满着信心。
