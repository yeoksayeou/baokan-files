    Class contradictions are irreconcilable
    Since the beginning of this year, the strike struggles in the United States have been surging. This is a sign of the increasing intensification of class contradictions and class struggle within the United States. Although the Johnson administration, in the name of "national interest," wants American workers to tighten their belts and uses various deceptive propaganda to fool them, it still cannot prevent the continuous outbreak of large-scale strikes.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as twenty years ago that "the American reactionaries must attack the American people before they can launch a war." The burden of the war of aggression against Vietnam that the American ruling group is placing on the working people is becoming heavier and heavier. Not long ago, Johnson assured the American people that both guns and butter could be had at the same time, but recently he openly asked them to "make sacrifices" for the war of aggression against Vietnam. Such a disastrous policy of the Johnson administration cannot but arouse increasingly strong resistance.
    At present, the strike struggles in various parts of the United States, which rise one after another, are mainly economic struggles to improve living and working conditions. However, they cannot but make the difficulties caused by the setbacks of the Johnson administration's aggressive policy more serious. What is particularly noteworthy is that the masses of workers in some American cities have joined the ranks of the struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam, which shows that the political consciousness of the American working class is rapidly increasing.
    It can be affirmed that as the Johnson administration continues to expand the war externally and intensifies its exploitation of the people internally, the American working class's struggle against exploitation and oppression will surely become more high-pitched, and the spearhead of the struggle will increasingly point directly to the domestic and foreign reactionary policies of the American ruling group. The American working class and the American people want revolution, they want to rise up and support the people's struggles in countries that are being invaded and controlled by U.S. imperialism. This is the inevitable law of class struggle.

    阶级矛盾不可调和
    今年以来，美国的罢工斗争风起云涌。这是美国国内阶级矛盾和阶级斗争日益激化的标志。约翰逊政府尽管以“国家利益”为名，要美国工人勒紧腰带，并用各种欺骗宣传来愚弄工人，仍不能阻止大规模罢工的不断爆发。
    毛泽东同志早在二十年前就指出，“美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。”美国统治集团加在劳动人民身上的侵越战争负担越来越沉重。不久以前约翰逊向美国人民保证，大炮与牛油可兼而有之，最近却公然要求他们为侵越战争“作出牺牲”了。约翰逊政府的这种灾难政策，当然不能不引起日益强烈的反抗。
    目前，美国各地此伏彼起的罢工斗争，虽然主要还是属于争取改善生活条件和劳动条件的经济斗争的性质，但不能不使约翰逊政府由于侵略政策挫折所产生的困难更为严重。特别值得注意的是，美国一些城市的工人群众已纷纷投入反对侵越战争的斗争行列，这说明美国工人阶级的政治觉悟，正在迅速提高。
    可以肯定，随着约翰逊政府对外继续扩大战争，对内加紧压榨人民，美国工人阶级反剥削、反压迫的斗争必将更加高涨，而且斗争的矛头势将越来越直接指向美国统治集团的内外反动政策。美国工人阶级和美国人民是要革命的，是要起来支持受到美帝国主义侵略和控制的国家的人民斗争的，这是阶级斗争的必然规律。
