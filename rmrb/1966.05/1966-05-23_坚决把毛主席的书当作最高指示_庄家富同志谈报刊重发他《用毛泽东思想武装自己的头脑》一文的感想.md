Edition: 1

    After the "Liberation Army Daily" and "Guangming Daily" published the article "Arming Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought" and the editor's note, all newspapers in the capital reprinted it. "Sports News" and "New Sports" also jointly wrote an editor's note. "China Youth Daily" also held a symposium and published a special article. We specially interviewed Comrade Zhuang Jiafu, the author of this article, who is now a table tennis coach.

    *The "Liberation Army Daily" and "Guangming Daily" Did the Right Thing*

    As soon as we met, this Communist Party member, who came from a working people's family and had a high degree of political awareness, excitedly told us: "The 'Liberation Army Daily,' 'Guangming Daily,' and other newspapers published my article written six years ago and added a note, which greatly encouraged me. This was the right thing to do. Let the broad masses of people judge why certain bourgeois 'authorities' want to criticize our articles on studying Chairman Mao's works. What are they criticizing? What are their intentions? Isn't this a great thing! I must point out that the reason they accused my article of being a typical example of 'simplification' and 'vulgarization' was not to criticize me personally, but to attack the great Mao Zedong Thought by insinuation and using the topic as a pretext, and to hate the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres who read Chairman Mao's books and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They waved the banner of 'authority,' wielded the big stick of 'simplification' and 'vulgarization,' and tried to block Mao Zedong Thought, not allowing us to learn and use it, so that they could oppose and distort Mao Zedong Thought. They are doing this to meet the needs of the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries. In essence, they are jackals of the same lair as Deng Tuo and his ilk.

      "Judging from the recent exposure in the newspapers of Deng Tuo and his gang's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism, all demons and monsters are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought and hate it the most, and they try every possible means to slander and attack Mao Zedong Thought. Because Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism, the most powerful ideological weapon for transforming the subjective and objective world. Once it is grasped by the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres, our class stand will be incomparably firm, our vision will become incomparably sharp, our socialist revolution and construction will leap forward, our proletarian dictatorship will become incomparably consolidated and powerful, and the Chinese revolution and even the world revolution will move towards complete victory. And that bunch of clowns will have nowhere to hide and will be completely finished. The enemy's frantic and vicious attacks on us in recent years show that the class struggle in the political and ideological field is very sharp, complex, and fierce. Since the enemy dares to challenge us, then we will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, fight tit-for-tat, tooth for tooth, and resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eradicate them from the roots!"

    *How "Arming Our Minds with Mao Zedong Thought" Was Created*

    Then, we talked about how the 1960 article was written. Comrade Zhuang Jiafu said modestly: "That article, limited by my own level, did not fully express our team's and my love for Chairman Mao and our experience in studying Chairman Mao's works. We haven't learned enough, but we learn a little and use a little. That article is a record of our gains in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to guide our participation in the 25th World Table Tennis Championships and the European tour. It is an objective reflection of our table tennis team's flexible study and application of Mao Zedong Thought." In fact, under the guidance of the Chinese table tennis team collective, which was nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Zhuang Jiafu began to study Chairman Mao's works very early, and worked hard to transform his own thinking, guide training and competition, and achieved good results. Originally, he was a right-handed player who was good at attacking. In order to help his comrades adapt to the European-style horizontal bat technique and enable China's table tennis to quickly reach the world peak, he resolutely gave up the right-handed attacking technique and switched to the horizontal defensive technique, willingly acting as a "paving stone." He was determined to take his own path, break the European horizontal bat tradition in a very short time, change defense into attack, and create a unique horizontal bat style. At the 25th World Table Tennis Championships in 1959, Comrade Rong Guotuan defeated the crowd and won the world championship for the first time, winning great honor for the motherland. Comrade Zhuang Jiafu, who was also a coach, entered the top eight in the men's singles along with Rong Guotuan and four other players, becoming one of China's first members to be included in the world's outstanding players. Why was Comrade Zhuang Jiafu able to do this? He said: "After studying articles such as 'Serve the People' and 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' in those years, I realized that playing table tennis is also for the revolution. As a revolutionary youth, all my actions should be done according to Chairman Mao's teachings, without considering personal gains or losses, and be a person without any selfishness, a person who is beneficial to the people. Only in this way can we completely establish a proletarian world outlook and live up to the expectations of the Party and Chairman Mao." In November of that year, he led Zhuang Zedong, Li Furong, and other sixteen- or seventeen-year-old players on an "expedition" to Northern Europe, winning consecutive battles and earning the reputation of "shaking overseas" and "little tigers." When Comrade Zhuang Jiafu reviewed the reasons for these achievements, he said with deep feeling: "That was entirely the result of Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds, and the result of combining the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions with the specific details of table tennis competition."

      "At that time, foreigners looked down on our right-handed technique. Whether speaking or writing, they believed that our right-handed technique was backward and had no future. But we didn't care about their nonsense at all. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, broke superstitions, worked hard, relied on our own efforts, we had to have what others had, and we had to have what others didn't have. We were determined to take our own path and establish our own style. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we overcame many difficulties. As a result, Rong Guotuan won the first world championship for the motherland. Zhuang Zedong, Li Furong, and others dared to fight hard at critical moments, were resourceful and brave, and won many world-class players by turning defeat into victory. Facts have proved that Chairman Mao's words are the truth that 'applies to all parts of the world.' It can be used in all walks of life, and it works wherever it is used. Due to the profound education and encouragement of Mao Zedong Thought, I wrote that article after returning to China. Since then, I have felt that reading Chairman Mao's books and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything I do should become an instinctive action of a revolutionary." After hearing these words, we can't help but ask certain "authorities," aren't you pouring cold water on the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres studying Chairman Mao's works, opposing the broad masses directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought, and denying that Mao Zedong Thought is a truth that applies to all parts of the world, isn't that paving the way for the restoration of the bourgeoisie?

    *Mao Zedong Thought Guides the Chinese Table Tennis Team to Move Forward Continuously*

    The Chinese table tennis team flexibly studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, uses Mao Zedong Thought to arm its mind, commands its playing, and thus rapidly grows into a sports team with a red ideology, excellent skills, and a good style. In such a revolutionary melting pot, Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's love for Chairman Mao's books grew stronger and stronger, and his consciousness and enthusiasm for flexibly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works increased day by day, and his proletarian revolutionary consciousness continuously improved. His performance in several World Championships after 1960 is an example. Take the 26th World Table Tennis Championships in 1961 as an example. At that time, the Party and the people placed high expectations on them. In order to unify understanding, improve combat effectiveness, and overcome the conservative thinking and personal gains and losses of some people, the leaders of the table tennis team took the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works, using the central idea of the fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong": "Dare to win, be good at fighting," as the guiding ideology for welcoming this competition. Organize everyone to repeatedly study and repeatedly understand three main issues: Not only must we strategically despise difficulties, continuously oppose right-leaning tendencies, boost our energy, and establish confidence in victory; but also tactically pay attention to difficulties, repeatedly find problems, think of solutions, and make full preparations. Not only must we highly promote the spirit of collectivism, helping each other and yielding to each other; but also fully mobilize everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, and everyone should strive to be the best. Not only must we be responsible, meticulous, and have the energy and perseverance to fight for every ball; but also have a long-term vision, an open mind, and the capacity and cultivation not to be nervous and abnormal due to the gains and losses of one ball or one point. Comrade Zhuang Jiafu actively used these dialectical viewpoints of Chairman Mao to arm himself, firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "everything should proceed from the interests of the people," and devoted himself to intense pre-match preparations. At that time, the Japanese team created a new technology, the "arc ball." In order to study countermeasures, the leaders of the Chinese table tennis team sent him to study the technical data of the arc ball. He unhesitatingly gave up his precious pre-match training time and actively completed the task, becoming a "person who walked in front of the world champion." After the competition began, he was not discouraged by the lack of pre-match training, but "admitted difficulties, analyzed difficulties, and fought against difficulties," and strived to achieve the best results. He said well: "Although I did not directly win the championship and win glory for the country, I contributed my own strength to our team's winning of the world championship and completed the task assigned to me by the Party and the people. I, like everyone else, felt great comfort and encouragement." This kind of action that puts the interests of the revolution first and actively contributes one's youth fully demonstrates the power of Mao Zedong Thought and the lofty spiritual realm of our young generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Who would criticize and slander such revolutionary youth and their articles? Only those bourgeois "authorities," only those demons and monsters.

    *Persist in Studying Chairman Mao's Works in the Three Great Revolutionary Movements*

    Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, Comrade Zhuang Jiafu's revolutionary spirit has been continuously developed. In 1964, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call to go to the three major revolutionary movements to train himself and transform himself, he actively signed up to go to the countryside to participate in labor training, and established a close class relationship with the poor and lower-middle peasants, which greatly advanced him on the road of revolutionization. In the scientific experiment of technological innovation of the table tennis team, he also actively offered advice and suggestions and worked hard, which played a significant role in promoting the improvement of training work and the improvement of technical level.

    When Comrade Zhuang Jiafu reviewed the work situation in 1965, he said: "Chairman Mao often taught us that we must train in the great storms and waves of the revolution. We must not only be domestic revolutionary promoters, but also international revolutionary promoters; we must serve the Chinese people and also serve the people of the world. In accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, at the end of 1964, I happily obeyed the organization's decision and went to Indonesia to work as a table tennis coach. After the September 30th Incident last year, I was still there. At that time, the Indonesian right-wing soldiers frantically launched an anti-communist and anti-Chinese wave, and white terror enveloped the entire country. Facing this severe class struggle, I and five other comrades studied Chairman Mao's works every day on class analysis, class and class struggle, In Memory of Norman Bethune, patriotism and internationalism, the exemplary role of Communist Party members in the national war, and other chapters. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings and were determined that no matter what kind of provocations and persecutions we encountered from the Indonesian reactionaries, we would fight for the honor and dignity of the motherland. Heads can be broken and blood can flow, but the revolutionary integrity of Mao Zedong's children cannot be lost. Truth and justice are on our side, we are not afraid of anything!"

      *Using Mao Zedong Thought to Cultivate a Younger Generation*

    After returning to China from Indonesia, Comrade Zhuang Jiafu took on the task of training successors for table tennis. He felt that this was a glorious and arduous task. He said: "Now workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary cadres across the country are studying Chairman Mao's works hard, highlighting politics, and taking Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work. Under this situation, it is not only important to study well ourselves, but more importantly, to use Mao Zedong Thought to lead the successors well. To this end, we actively use Mao Zedong Thought to solve all ideological and training competition problems. For example, some players encountered difficulties in practicing the new technology of backhand attack, and were somewhat shaken by the two-sided attack technique. I used Chairman Mao's saying that 'the growth of any new thing must go through difficulties and twists' to encourage them. First, solve the problem ideologically, help them improve their understanding, and strive to overcome the difficulties of playing the two-sided attack. The players said: 'This is much more effective than simply talking about how to play a backhand attack technically.' At the beginning of this year, based on some of the flexible ideological problems that athletes are prone to encounter in competitions, we studied and compiled 'What to Do in Twenty Situations?' with our comrades, and used Chairman Mao's relevant quotations to answer these questions. For example, what should we do when we encounter strong opponents in the competition and feel nervous and scared? We asked the players to study Chairman Mao's saying that 'superiority without preparation is not real superiority, nor is there any initiative. Understanding this point, an army that is inferior but prepared can often launch unexpected offensives against the enemy and defeat the superior.' This improved their courage and fighting spirit, and the effect was very good. Now, Chairman Mao's thought is like sunshine and rain, nourishing these seedlings. They are learning, living, and training vigorously with the motherland in their hearts and the world in their eyes. They listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This is a vivid reflection of the characteristics of our great era."

    From some of the brief examples listed above, we can clearly see that Mao Zedong Thought has become the guide for the actions of the Chinese table tennis team and Comrade Zhuang Jiafu, and has generated tremendous material strength. Obviously, the truth cannot be overthrown by scolding. The more the bourgeois "authorities" scold, the more it shows the correctness and greatness of Mao Zedong Thought, and the more the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers will support it. Therefore, Comrade Zhuang Jiafu finally said well: "I have not studied Chairman Mao's works enough, and I have used them even less, but Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary books. In the future, I will more respect and love Chairman Mao, and better flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Any bourgeois 'authority' or any enemy's attempt to prevent us from grasping Mao Zedong Thought is a futile effort."

### 坚决把毛主席的书当作最高指示  庄家富同志谈报刊重发他《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》一文的感想

专栏：

    坚决把毛主席的书当作最高指示
    庄家富同志谈报刊重发他《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》一文的感想
    《解放军报》、《光明日报》登载了《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》一文和编者按后，首都各报都转载了，《体育报》《新体育》也联合写了编者按。《中国青年报》还专门召开了座谈会，发了专文。我们特地访问了这篇文章的作者、现在担任乒乓球教练的庄家富同志。
    《解放军报》《光明日报》做得很正确
    我们一见面，这位出身于劳动人民家庭，具有高度政治觉悟的共产党员，便非常激动地对我们说：“《解放军报》《光明日报》等报刊把我六年前写的文章登出来，并加了按语，对自己鼓励很大。这件事做得很正确。让广大群众来鉴别一下某些资产阶级‘权威’为什么要骂我们写的学习毛主席著作的文章？他们骂的是什么？居心何在？这岂不是一件大好事吗！我不能不指出，他们所以指责我的文章为‘简单化’、‘庸俗化’的典型，那不是指责我个人，而是指桑骂槐、借题发挥，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，仇视读毛主席的书、按毛主席的指示办事的广大工农兵群众和革命干部。他们打着‘权威’的招牌，挥舞‘简单化’、‘庸俗化’的大棒，妄想把毛泽东思想封锁起来，不许我们学和用，以便于他们反对毛泽东思想，篡改毛泽东思想。他们这样做，是适应资产阶级和一切反动派的需要的。他们与邓拓等黑帮实质上是一丘之貉。
      “从最近报刊上揭发邓拓之流反党反社会主义的罪行来看，凡是牛鬼蛇神都最怕毛泽东思想，最恨毛泽东思想，千方百计地诽谤、攻击毛泽东思想。因为，毛泽东思想是最高最活的马克思列宁主义，是改造主客观世界最强大的思想武器，一旦被工农兵群众和革命干部所掌握，我们的阶级立场就会无比坚定，眼光就会变得无比敏锐，我们的社会主义革命和建设事业就会飞跃前进，我们的无产阶级专政就会变得无比巩固和强大，中国革命乃至世界革命就会走向彻底胜利。而他们那帮跳梁小丑就会无处藏身、彻底完蛋了。几年来敌人如此疯狂、狠毒地向我们进攻，说明政治思想领域内的阶级斗争是非常尖锐、复杂而又激烈的。敌人既然胆敢向我们挑战，那我们就按毛主席的教导，针锋相对，以牙还牙，坚决、彻底、干净地把他们连根铲除！”
    《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》是怎样产生的
    接着，我们谈起了一九六○年的文章是怎么写出来的。庄家富同志谦逊地说：“那篇文章限于自己的水平，还没有把我们队和我对毛主席的热爱、对毛主席著作学习的体会充分地表达出来。我们学得很不够，不过，我们学一点，就用一点。那篇文章就是记录我们学习运用毛泽东思想去指导参加二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛和访欧比赛的一点收获，是我们乒乓球队活学活用毛泽东思想的一点客观反映。”事实上，在用毛泽东思想哺育的中国乒乓球队集体的带动下，庄家富同志很早就开始学习毛主席著作，努力用来改造自己的思想，指导训练和比赛，收到很好的效果。原来他是直握球拍擅长进攻的运动员。为了帮助同志们适应欧洲式横拍打法，使我国乒乓球运动迅速攀上世界高峰，他毅然放弃直拍攻球打法，改成横拍守球打法，甘愿作一块“铺路石”。他决心要走自己的路，在很短时间内，打破欧洲横拍的传统，变守球为攻球，创造了独特的横拍风格。一九五九年第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛上，容国团同志力胜群雄，首次夺得世界冠军，为祖国争得了极大的荣誉，身兼教练的庄家富同志也和容国团等四名队员一起进入男子单打前八名，成为我国首批列入世界优秀选手的成员之一。庄家富同志为什么能做到这一步呢？他说：“那几年我学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章后，认识到打球也是为了革命，作为一个革命青年，自己的一切行动都应该按毛主席的教导去做，不计较个人得失，做一个毫无自私自利之心的人，做一个有益于人民的人。只有这样，才能彻底树立无产阶级的世界观，不辜负党和毛主席的期望。”当年十一月，他又带领庄则栋、李富荣等十六七岁的小将“出征”北欧，连战皆捷，赢得了“威震海外”和“小老虎”的赞誉。庄家富同志回顾这些成绩取得的原因时，深有感触地说：“那完全是毛泽东思想武装我们头脑的结果，是把毛主席指示的精神和乒乓球比赛具体结合的结果。”
      “那时候，外国人对我们的直拍打法是瞧不起的，无论说话写文章，都认为我们的直拍打法落后，没有发展前途。可我们根本不睬他们那一套，我们按毛主席的教导，破除迷信，奋发图强，自力更生，别人有的我们要有，别人没有的我们也要有，坚决走自己的路，树立自己的风格。在毛泽东思想指引下，我们克服了重重难关，结果容国团为祖国夺得了第一个世界冠军。庄则栋、李富荣等在关键时刻敢打敢拼，智勇双全，反败为胜，赢了许多世界强手。事实证明，毛主席的话是‘放之四海而皆准’的真理。各行各业都可以用，用到那里那里灵。由于受到毛泽东思想深刻的教育和激励，我回国后就写了那篇文章。从那时起，我就感到读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切，应该成为一个革命者本能的行动。”听了这番话，我们不禁要问某些“权威”，你们用“庸俗化”、“简单化”给广大工农兵、革命干部学毛主席著作大泼冷水，来反对广大群众直接掌握毛泽东思想，否定毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，不是在为资产阶级复辟鸣锣开道吗？
    毛泽东思想指引中国乒乓球队不断前进
    中国乒乓球队是活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，统帅打球，从而迅速成长为一支思想红、球艺精、作风好的运动队。在这样一个革命化的熔炉里，庄家富同志对毛主席的书越来越热爱，活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性和积极性与日俱增，无产阶级的革命觉悟不断提高，一九六○年后，他在几届世界锦标赛中的表现就是例证。拿一九六一年第二十六届世界乒乓球锦标赛来说吧，当时党和人民对他们寄予了很高的期望。为了统一认识，提高战斗力，克服部分人的保守思想和个人得失的考虑，乒乓球队的领导带头大学毛主席著作，以《毛泽东选集》第四卷的中心思想：“敢于胜利，善于斗争”，作为迎接这届比赛的指导思想。组织大家反复学习、反复认识了三个主要问题：既要在战略上藐视困难，不断反右倾，鼓干劲，树立胜利信心；又要在战术上重视困难，反复找问题，想办法，做好充分准备。既要高度发扬集体主义精神，彼此互助互让；又要充分发挥每个人的积极性与创造性，人人力争上游。既要认真负责，一丝不苟，有每球必争的干劲和毅力；又要高瞻远瞩，胸襟开阔，有不因一球一分之得失而紧张失常的器量与修养。庄家富同志积极运用毛主席的这些辩证观点把自己武装起来，牢牢记住毛主席“一切从人民的利益出发”的教导，投入了紧张的赛前准备。当时日本队创造了一种新技术“弧圈球”，我国乒乓球队为了研究对策，领导派他研究弧圈球技术资料，他毫不犹疑地放弃了宝贵的赛前集训时间，积极地完成了任务，成为“走在世界冠军前面的人”。比赛开始后，他丝毫未因缺少赛前训练而气馁，而是“承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争”，力争打出最好的成绩。他说得好：“我个人虽然没有直接取得冠军，为国争光，但为我队夺得世界冠军尽了自己一点力量，完成了党和人民交给自己的任务，我和大家一样感到莫大的快慰和鼓舞。”这种以革命利益为重，积极贡献自己青春的行动，充分显示了毛泽东思想的威力，显示了毛泽东思想哺育下，我们年青一代崇高的精神境界。什么人才会责骂、诬蔑这样的革命青年和他们写的文章呢？只有那些资产阶级的“权威”，只有那些牛鬼蛇神。
    在三大革命运动中坚持学毛主席著作
    通过毛主席著作的学习，庄家富同志的革命精神不断发扬。一九六四年，为了响应毛主席的号召，到三大革命运动中去锻炼自己、改造自己，他主动报名下农村进行劳动锻炼，和贫下中农建立了亲密的阶级感情，使自己在革命化的大道上大大向前迈进了一步。在乒乓球队技术革新的科学实验中，他也积极地献计献策，刻苦钻研，对改进训练工作和提高技术水平起了不少促进作用。
    庄家富同志回顾一九六五年的工作情况时说：“毛主席经常教导我们，要在革命的大风大浪里锻炼。既要做国内的革命促进派，也要做国际的革命促进派；要为中国人民服务，也要为世界人民服务。本着毛主席的教导，一九六四年底，我愉快地服从了组织的决定，到印度尼西亚担任乒乓球教练工作。去年九月三十日事件后，我仍在那里。当时，印尼右派军人疯狂地掀起了反共反华浪潮，白色恐怖笼罩印尼全国。面对这场严酷的阶级斗争，我和其他五个同志一起，每天学习毛主席著作中有关阶级分析，阶级和阶级斗争，纪念白求恩，爱国主义和国际主义，共产党员在民族战争中的模范作用等篇章，我们遵循毛主席的教导，决心无论遇到印尼反动派什么样的挑衅和迫害，都要为祖国的荣誉和尊严而战，头可断、血可流，毛泽东儿女的革命气节不可丢，真理和正义在我们这一边，我们什么也不怕！”
      用毛泽东思想培育更年青的一代
    从印尼回国后，庄家富同志担任了培养乒乓球运动接班人的工作，他感到这是一项光荣而又艰巨的任务。他说：“现在全国工农兵和革命干部都在大学毛主席著作，突出政治，把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示。在这种形势下，不仅自己要学好，更重要的是要用毛泽东思想把接班人带好。为此，我们就积极运用毛泽东思想来解决思想上和训练比赛上的一切问题。比如一些队员在练习反手攻球的新技术时遇到了困难，对两边攻的打法有些动摇，我就用毛主席‘任何新生事物的成长都是要经过艰难曲折的’那段语录去勉励他们，首先从思想上解决问题，帮助他们提高认识，努力克服了打两边攻的困难。队员们说：‘这比单纯从技术上讲反手攻球怎么打，效果大多了。’今年初，我们根据运动员在比赛中容易出现的一些活的思想问题，和同志们一起研究编了‘二十个怎么办？’用毛主席的有关语录回答这些问题。比如，在比赛中遇到强手紧张害怕时怎么办？我们就要求队员学习毛主席‘优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动。懂得这一点，劣势而有准备之军，常可对敌举行不意的攻势，把优势者打败’这段语录，这样便提高了他们的勇气和斗志，效果很好。现在，毛主席的思想就象阳光和雨露一样滋润着这些幼苗，他们胸怀祖国、放眼世界，生气勃勃地学习、生活、锻炼，他们听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，这是我们伟大时代特征的生动反映。”
    从上面列举的一些简要事例中，我们可以鲜明地看出，毛泽东思想已经成为中国乒乓球队和庄家富同志行动的指南，并已产生了巨大的物质力量。显然，真理是骂不倒的，资产阶级的“权威”们越骂，越说明毛泽东思想的正确、伟大，广大的工农兵群众就越要拥护。所以庄家富同志最后说得好：“毛主席著作我还学习得很不够，用得更不够，但毛主席的书是革命的书，今后，我要更加崇敬、热爱毛主席，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，任何资产阶级‘权威’，任何敌人企图反对我们掌握毛泽东思想，是枉费心机的。”
