    Exposing the Reactionary Essence of the "Theory of Caring for Labor Power"
    Deng Tuo brandished the banner of "caring for labor power" in a vain attempt to slander the Party's general line for socialist construction and prevent us from making revolution. We, the people of Lin County, like the people of the whole country, deeply realize that the Party cares most about labor power and are determined to hold high the red flag of the general line and advance forever.
    Ma Youjin, Special-Class Labor Model of the Red Flag Canal in Lin County, Henan Province, Deputy County Head

    Deng Tuo, the owner of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, threw out the "Theory of Caring for Labor Power," which, like other poisonous arrows, is a thoroughly anti-Party and anti-socialist piece of black talk. This guy, flaunting his writing skills, used veiled language to slander our Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, as "not caring for labor power," in order to sow discord between the people and the Party. Deng Tuo's criminal words and deeds have aroused the people of Lin County to filled with righteous indignation.

    In his "Theory of Caring for Labor Power," Deng Tuo quoted extensively from the classics, saying that slave owners and the landlord class stipulated the proportion of labor power occupied by various basic constructions, and that as early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, many ancient politicians already knew the importance of caring for labor power. Through their own ruling experience, they discovered the so-called "limits" of "using the people's strength," which in reality was the discovery of some "objective laws of labor power waxing and waning." He also said that "we should learn from the experience of the ancients and pay more attention to caring for labor power in all aspects."

    These black words of Deng Tuo are an insinuation and insult to our great Party, implying that it does not know the importance of caring for labor power as well as slave owners and the feudal landlord class. He wants us to "learn from the experience of the ancients" and "discover the objective laws of labor power waxing and waning." Isn't this blatant slander of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results as not conforming to objective laws? Since Deng Tuo slanders the general line of socialist construction as not conforming to objective laws and curses the Party as not caring for labor power as well as slave owners and the landlord class, isn't he insulting the masters of our new society—the broad masses of working people—as being inferior to the slaves of the old society?

    Although Deng Tuo harbors a deep hatred for the Party and socialism and uses the method of greatly beautifying the ruling class of the old society to oppose the Party and the people, the broad masses of working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrew the old ruling class, stood up, and became the masters. They have not forgotten the suffering of exploitation and oppression in the old society. At that time, the broad masses of working people had no food or clothing, and the ruling class used the methods of allocating funds and conscripting laborers to force them to build palaces and gardens for their enjoyment. Even if the ruling class in some places engaged in water conservancy and other basic constructions, it was only to squeeze the people's wealth. In the old society, the exploiting class in Lin County, in order to maintain their rule, built government offices, temples, and blockhouses, and some villages even built ancestral halls. The laborers who participated in these basic constructions all worked under the whips of landlords and rich peasants. In the old society, I was also dragged by them to engage in so-called "basic construction." I tasted the flavors of beatings, scoldings, hunger, and cold, and I personally witnessed many class brothers being tortured to death. Is all this what Deng Tuo and his ilk call the feudal ruling class "caring for labor power"? At that time, the broad masses of working people were so oppressed that they could not live on, and they rose up in resistance one after another. In history, there were countless slave riots and peasant uprisings, forcing the ruling class to not be able to wantonly carry out so-called "basic construction." Is this what Deng Tuo calls the feudal ruling class of the old society discovering the law of the waxing and waning of labor power? This is completely nonsense.

    We, the broad masses of working people in Lin County, who have experienced the pain of the old society, have also discovered the law of the exploiting class's use of labor power, that is, they disregard the life and death of the people and exploit and plunder labor power to the maximum extent. In that dark and gloomy old society, countless poor and lower-middle peasant class brothers, on snowy nights, on New Year's Eve, with tears in their eyes, left their families and were dragged by the landlords and reactionaries to perform hard labor. In the history of Lin County, the reactionary ruling class forced the working people to work for them, like cattle and horses. Nowhere could we find a reactionary ruler who, starting from caring for labor power, carried out a little mountain construction to relieve the suffering of the working people from "lack of water to drink" and "difficulty in traveling." Until the time of liberation, Lin County had only one seventeen-kilometer horse-drawn road from the county seat to the border of Anyang. The rest were rugged and uneven mountain trails, and all transportation relied on human carrying. Many working people were crushed and hunched over. In the past, two-thirds of the villages in the county had no water source, and even people and livestock had to cross mountains and ridges to fetch water for several or even dozens of miles. Many people were killed by falls in the valleys, and some were eaten by wolves at night while carrying water. Millions of laborers lived in such suffering. Which dynasty or generation of the ruling class ever cared about it?

    After liberation, the Lin County Party Committee followed the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and, on the basis of collectivization, led the people of the county to carry out mountain construction, build roads, and manage water conservancy. With the birth of the people's commune and the strengthening of collective power, a Great Leap Forward in production and construction appeared in the county. Every year, tens of thousands of laborers participated in the construction. According to Deng Tuo's statement, haven't we committed the crime of not caring for labor power again? In fact, our active leadership of the people of Lin County in carrying out mountain construction is fundamentally to care for labor power. In recent years, Lin County has built more than 300 kilometers of highways and more than 3,000 kilometers of field roads. The originally closed mountainous areas have become accessible in all directions. Even field transportation has basically eliminated the heavy manual labor of carrying on shoulders, realizing vehicle transportation, saving more than 16 million workdays of transportation every year, and investing them in water conservancy construction and farmland capital construction. Since 1960, Lin County has averaged more than 3 million workdays each year to build the Red Flag Canal, which is more than 340 li long, from Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, to Lin County, and has introduced the Zhang River water into Lin County, solving the problem of people drinking water nearby in this thousand-year-old drought-stricken mountainous area, and also creating hundreds of thousands of mu of self-flowing irrigated land. After the Red Flag Canal was opened to water, the average annual labor saved is several times more than the labor used for canal construction.

    In recent years, in order to change the face of the mountainous areas, Lin County has had more than 10% of its labor force engaged in water conservancy and transportation construction every year. However, in his "Theory of Caring for Labor Power," Deng Tuo said that in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, "according to the level of social production at that time, the ancients stipulated that the labor force used for various basic constructions could only account for about 1% of the total labor force. Now it seems that this ratio is appropriate for ancient countries that take agricultural production as their foundation." Deng Tuo said that the labor force stipulated by the ancients for various basic constructions "was based on the level of social production at that time," and also said that "now it seems that this ratio is still appropriate for our country." Isn't this saying that our production today is still at the level of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods? This is completely an attempt to erase the achievements of the great revolution and construction led by our Party and the broad masses of the people, in order to achieve the goal of overthrowing our Party.

    Deng Tuo cannot erase the achievements of our Party in leading the people in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction. Not to mention other places, let's take our Lin County as an example. Before liberation, the yield per mu of grain was at most only a hundred jin, but from mutual aid teams, agricultural cooperatives to communes, the grain yield has been continuously increasing. By 1964, the average yield per mu in the county reached 410 jin. The labor force we used for mountain construction was also determined according to our own level of production development. Therefore, since liberation, agricultural production and mountain construction have been continuously developing and expanding. Mountain construction has been continuously developing, which has promoted the continuous improvement of agricultural production. Our current production level is many times higher than in the old society, but Deng Tuo still wants us to carry out construction according to the so-called ratio stipulated by the ancients. Isn't this nakedly exposing your true colors of opposing socialist construction?

    Deng Tuo threw out the "Theory of Caring for Labor Power" to oppose the general line of socialist construction during the period when our country suffered from natural disasters and the whole country experienced temporary difficulties. At that time, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the revolutionary policy of striving for strength and self-reliance, calling on us to vigorously develop agriculture. However, in his "Theory of Caring for Labor Power," Deng Tuo proposed that "in bumper years, the labor force occupied by basic construction can reach about 1% of the total labor force; in normal years, it can only account for about 0.6%; in famine years with no harvest, it can only account for a maximum of 0.3%." He also said that there are many things that must be estimated as to whether one's own strength is competent, and never force it. Isn't this cursing our self-reliance as being incompetent and "too forced" in vigorously developing agriculture? It is really singing the same tune as imperialism and modern revisionism.

    The people of Lin County, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, like the rest of the country, held high the red flag of the general line of socialist construction during the difficult years when natural disasters struck, regardless of the vicious attacks of class enemies at home and abroad. We not only persisted in building the Red Flag Canal, but also built field roads, promoting the development of agricultural production. Although some people wanted mountain construction in Lin County to "dismount" at that time, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants issued such heroic voices: "We would rather fight hard than suffer bitterly!" The labor force participating in mountain construction far exceeded the ratio mentioned by Deng Tuo. Isn't this because we did not estimate our own abilities? No. The people of Lin County know their own strength very well. Our collective farmers in the socialist era not only have the support of material strength such as grain reserves and public accumulation, but also the thought of self-reliance given by Chairman Mao. This is the powerful force that enables the people of Lin County to resist natural disasters and carry out mountain construction. Where would these forces be in the old society? However, Deng Tuo fabricated the proportion of labor force occupied by basic construction in disaster years in the old society, asking us to follow suit. Isn't this saying that the disaster years in the socialist era are disaster years in feudal society? This is a great slander against our socialism.

    We tell Deng Tuo and his ilk that the people of Lin County, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the more serious the natural disaster, the more vigorous the revolutionary spirit of changing the world. Last year, when we started building the three main canals of the Red Flag Canal, we encountered a drought that had not been seen in a century. However, in this year of severe drought, the canal construction site had a maximum of more than 60,000 people, accounting for a quarter of the total labor force in the county. As a result, the canals planned to be completed in five years were completed in seven months, turning 330,000 mu of drought-stricken land into irrigated land. From Deng Tuo's point of view, haven't we not cared for labor power again? At that time, the broad masses of commune members actively demanded to increase the labor force for canal construction and speed up the progress of canal construction in order to increase the strength to resist drought as soon as possible. Although the county party committee stipulated that the elderly and women should not participate in canal construction, many old stonemasons and young women still secretly ran to the construction site to participate in the construction. Don't these people care about themselves?

    Deng Tuo shot this poisonous arrow of the "Theory of Caring for Labor Power" to slander the general line of socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward, and to prevent the broad masses of people from making revolution. However, the broad masses of working people in Lin County, whether in bumper years, normal years, or disaster years, have held high the great red flag of the general line, making the red flowers of the Great Leap Forward bloom all over the county, making mountain construction better and better, and making people's lives better and better. Didn't Deng Tuo curse that our socialist construction was "finished" and "bashing its head against the wall"? In fact, it is not us who are bashing our heads against the wall, but Deng Tuo and his gang.

    揭穿《爱护劳动力的学说》的反动实质
    邓拓打出“爱护劳动力”的招牌，妄图诬蔑党的社会主义建设总路线，要我们不革命。我们林县人民同全国人民一样，深深体会到党最爱护劳动力，决心高举总路线红旗，永远前进
    河南省林县红旗渠特等劳动模范、副县长　马有金
    “三家村”黑店掌柜邓拓，抛出的《爱护劳动力的学说》，同其他毒箭一样，是彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义的黑话。这个家伙，卖弄文笔，含沙射影，诬蔑我们党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进是“不爱护劳动力”，来挑拨离间人民群众和党的关系。邓拓这种罪恶言行，引起了林县人民的满腔义愤。
    邓拓在《爱护劳动力的学说》里，引经据典地说什么奴隶主和地主阶级规定了各种基本建设占用劳动力的比例，说什么早在春秋战国时代，许多古代政治家已经知道爱护劳动力的重要性，他们通过自己的统治经验，发现了所谓“使用民力”的“限度”，实际上就是发现了劳动力“消长的某些客观规律”。并且说什么“我们应该从古人的经验中得到启发，更加注意在各方面努力爱护劳动力。”
    邓拓的这些黑话，是在影射、辱骂我们伟大的党，不如奴隶主和封建地主阶级知道爱护劳动力的重要。他要我们“从古人的经验中得到启发”，“发现劳动力消长的客观规律”，这不是明目张胆地在诬蔑党制定的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线，是不合乎客观规律吗？既然邓拓诬蔑社会主义建设总路线不符合客观规律，诅咒党不如奴隶主和地主阶级爱护劳动力，那么，不是把我们新社会的主人——广大劳动人民，辱骂成连旧社会的奴隶都不如吗？
    尽管邓拓对党对社会主义怀着刻骨的仇恨，以极力美化旧社会统治阶级的手法，来反党反人民，但是广大劳动人民在共产党的领导下，推翻了旧的统治阶级，翻了身，当了主人，并没有忘记旧社会遭受剥削压迫的痛苦。那时，广大劳动人民衣食无着，统治阶级以派款、抓伕的办法，强迫劳动人民修建供他们享受的宫殿、花园。有些地方的统治阶级即便搞一些水利和其他基本建设。也是为了榨取民膏。在旧社会，林县的剥削阶级为了维护他们的统治，修衙门、寺院、炮楼，有些村庄还盖祠堂。参加这些基本建设的民工，都是在地主老财的皮鞭下干活。我在旧社会也曾被他们拉去搞所谓“基本建设”，打、骂、饿、冻，啥滋味都尝过，并且亲眼看见过许多阶级兄弟被活活折磨死。这一切，难道就是邓拓之流所说的封建统治阶级“爱护劳动力”吗？在那时候，广大劳动人民被压迫得无法活下去，纷纷起来反抗，历史上不知有多少次奴隶暴动和农民起义，逼使统治阶级不能肆意进行所谓“基本建设”，难道这就是邓拓所说的旧社会封建统治阶级发现了劳动力的消长规律吗？这完全是胡说八道。
    我们林县饱经旧社会痛苦的广大劳动人民，也发现了剥削阶级使用劳动力的规律，那就是他们不顾人民的死活，最大限度地剥削掠夺劳动力。在那暗无天日的旧社会，不知有多少贫下中农阶级兄弟，在风雪之夜，在大年三十，含着泪水，离开家人，被地主反动派抓去服苦役。在林县的历史上，反动统治阶级都是强迫劳动人民为他们干活，当牛当马。哪里也找不到一个反动统治者从爱护劳动力出发，搞一点山区建设，解除劳动人民“缺水吃”和“行路难”的痛苦。直到解放的时候，林县只有从县城到安阳边境一条十七公里的马车路，其他都是崎岖不平的山间羊肠小道，一切运输全靠人担背驮，很多劳动人民被压得弯腰驼背。过去全县有三分之二的村庄没有水源，连人畜用水都要翻山越岭跑几里甚至几十里去担，有不少人被摔死在山谷间，还有人在夜间担水被狼吃掉。千千万万的劳动力在这样苦难中生活，哪一朝哪一代的统治阶级过问过？
    解放以后，林县县委遵循党中央和毛主席的教导，在集体化的基础上，领导全县人民进行山区建设，修道路，办水利。随着人民公社的诞生，集体力量的壮大，在全县出现了生产建设大跃进，每年有数以万计的劳动力参加建设。照邓拓的说法，我们不是又犯了不爱护劳动力的罪过吗？其实，我们积极领导林县人民进行山区建设，正是从根本上来爱护劳动力。这几年来，林县建成了总长三百多公里的公路，三千多公里的田间道路。原来闭塞的山区变得四通八达；连田间运输也基本上消灭了肩挑人抬的笨重体力劳动，实现了运输车辆化，每年节约运输工一千六百多万个，投入水利建设和农田基本建设。林县从一九六○年以来，平均每年以三百多万个工，修建从山西平顺县到林县的干渠总长达三百四十多里的红旗渠，把漳河水引进林县，使这个千年苦旱的山区，解决了人民就近吃水问题，还有了几十万亩自流灌溉的水浇地。红旗渠通水后，平均每年节约的劳动力比修渠使用的劳力多几倍。
    这些年来，林县为了改变山区面貌，每年有百分之十几的劳力在修水利，办交通。而邓拓在《爱护劳动力的学说》里，却说什么春秋战国时代“按当时社会的生产水平，古人规定了各种基本建设所用的劳动力，大致只能占总劳动力的百分之一左右。现在看来，这个比例对于以农业生产为根本的古老国家是适当的。”邓拓说古人规定的各种基本建设所占的劳动力，“是按当时社会生产水平”，又说“现在看来这个比例对我们国家还是适当的。”这不是说我们今天的生产还停留在春秋战国时代的水平吗？这完全是企图把我们党领导广大人民群众进行的伟大革命和建设的成就一笔抹煞，以便达到推翻我们党的目的。
    我们党领导人民进行伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成绩，邓拓是骂不掉的。不说别的地方，就拿我们林县说，解放前的粮食亩产量最多只有百把斤，可是从互助组、农业社到公社化，粮食产量不断提高，到一九六四年，全县平均亩产达到四百一十斤。我们搞山区建设所占的劳动力，也是根据自己的生产发展水平决定的。因此，解放以来，农业生产和山区建设都在不断发展和扩大，山区建设不断向前发展，又促进农业生产不断提高。我们今天的生产水平比旧社会不知提高多少倍，而邓拓还要我们按照所谓古人规定的比例进行建设，这不是赤裸裸地暴露了你们反对社会主义建设的真面目吗？
    邓拓抛出《爱护劳动力的学说》，反对社会主义建设总路线，是在我国遭受自然灾害袭击，全国出现了暂时困难的时期。当时，党中央、毛主席提出奋发图强、自力更生的革命方针，号召我们大办农业，而邓拓却在《爱护劳动力的学说》里，提出“在丰年基本建设占用的劳动力可以达到总劳力的百分之一左右；平年只能占百分之零点六左右；没有什么收成的荒年，顶多只能占百分之零点三”。并且说什么有许多事情必须估计自己的力量是否胜任，决不勉强。这不是在骂我们自力更生是力不胜任、大办农业“过于勉强”吗？真是同帝国主义、现代修正主义唱的一个调门。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的林县人民同全国一样，在遭受自然灾害袭击的困难年月里，不顾国内外阶级敌人的恶毒攻击，始终高举着社会主义建设总路线的红旗。我们不仅坚持修建了红旗渠，还修建了田间道路，促进了农业生产发展。当时虽然有人要林县山区建设“下马”，但是广大贫下中农却发出这样豪迈的声音：“宁愿苦战，不愿苦熬！”参加山区建设的劳动力，远远超过邓拓所说的比例，这是不是我们没有估计自己的能力呢？不是的。我们林县人民对自己的力量知道得一清二楚。我们社会主义时代的集体农民，不但有储备粮和公共积累等物质力量支持，还有毛主席给予的自力更生的思想，这就是林县人民能够抵御自然灾害，进行山区建设的强大力量，这些力量旧社会哪会有？而邓拓却编造了什么旧社会灾年的基本建设占用劳动力的比例，要我们照办，这不是把社会主义时代的灾年说成封建社会的灾年了吗？这是对我们社会主义莫大的诬蔑。
    我们告诉邓拓之流，用毛泽东思想武装起来的林县人民，自然灾害愈严重，改天换地的革命精神愈旺盛。去年我们开始建设红旗渠的三条干渠，遇到百年不遇的旱灾。可是，就在这大旱年头，修渠工地最多上了六万多人，占全县总劳动力的四分之一，结果计划五年修成的渠道七个月就完工了，让三十三万亩干旱的土地变成了水浇地。以邓拓的观点看来，我们不是又不爱护劳动力了吗？当时广大社员群众为了尽快增加抗拒旱灾的力量，积极要求增加修渠的劳动力，加快修渠进度。尽管县委规定不让老年人、妇女参加修渠，但仍有不少老石匠和年轻妇女偷偷跑到工地上参加建设，难道这些群众自己不爱护自己吗？
    邓拓射出《爱护劳动力的学说》这支毒箭，诬蔑社会主义建设总路线、大跃进，要广大人民不要革命。可是我们林县广大劳动人民，不管是丰年、平年还是灾年，都是高举总路线的伟大红旗，使大跃进的红花开遍了全县，山区建设越来越好，人民生活也越过越好。邓拓不是骂我们社会主义建设“完蛋”了、“碰得头破血流”吗？事实上，碰得头破血流的不是我们，而是邓拓这伙黑帮。
