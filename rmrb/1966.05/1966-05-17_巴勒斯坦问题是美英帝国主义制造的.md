　　In western Asia, on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, lies a narrow strip of land called Palestine. This region, covering an area of over 25,000 square kilometers, is situated at the transportation hub of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is also the outlet for oil from countries such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Therefore, it holds a vital position both economically and strategically.

　　The Palestinian question, on the surface, appears to be an ethnic dispute between Arabs and Jews, but in reality, it was instigated and manufactured single-handedly by US-British imperialism. They attempt to foster reactionary Zionism, provoke ethnic disputes between Arabs and Jews, establish a bridgehead for aggression in the region, create tensions in the Middle East, stifle the national liberation movements in the area, and continue to maintain their colonial rule over Palestine and Middle Eastern countries.

　　Over a thousand years B.C., Jews had established states in the Palestinian region. Later, these states were successively conquered by Assyria and Babylon, and the Jews began to disperse and migrate to various parts of the world. From the sixth and seventh centuries A.D., Arabs began to settle in Palestine. For over a thousand years, the Arabs have ruled this land and Arabized the entire region. The vast majority of the residents here are Arabs.

　　After World War I, Britain occupied Palestine and implemented so-called "mandate rule," actually using Palestine as a strategic base to control the Middle East and eventually dominate the world. At that time, there were 90,000 Jews and 660,000 Arabs in Palestine. To deal with the resistance of the Arab people, British imperialism adopted an insidious "divide and rule" colonial tactic in Palestine, that is, using and supporting the "Zionist movement" initiated by the European Jewish bourgeoisie, it began to relocate Jews from all over the world to Palestine. After Hitler established a fascist regime in Germany and during World War II, European Jews were subjected to bloody persecution. US-British imperialism took advantage of this situation, massively luring European Jews to Palestine, allowing them to enjoy political and economic privileges, lending them various modern weapons, and encouraging them to plunder Arab land and expel Arabs.

　　After World War II, US imperialism actively invaded Palestine, intensifying its collusion with Zionist elements, attempting to use Palestine as a springboard for aggression and interference in Asia and Africa. In 1947, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations, against the will of the Arabs, passed a resolution to partition Palestine, stipulating the establishment of two independent states, one Arab and one Jewish, in Palestine, with the city of Jerusalem internationalized. On May 14, 1948, the Jews established the State of Israel, but the Arab state was not established. Due to the instigation of US-British imperialism, Israel launched a war of aggression against neighboring Arab countries the day after its establishment, May 15, which lasted until a truce was declared in February 1949. During the war, Israel occupied large tracts of land, expanding its original control from 14,000 square kilometers to 20,700 square kilometers, and occupying most of the new city of Jerusalem.

　　Not only that, Israel forcibly expelled the Arabs who had lived in Palestine for generations, unreasonably confiscating their property, turning a large number of Palestinian Arabs into refugees. According to statistics, the total number of refugees is more than 1.2 million, of which 650,000 are scattered in Jordan, 300,000 in the United Arab Republic, and more than 100,000 each in Syria and Lebanon. They live a life of displacement and their situation is very tragic. They firmly demand to return to their homes and establish a peaceful life. Therefore, the refugee problem has become a very acute issue in the Palestinian question.

　　US imperialism has consistently supported Israel's policy of aggression and expansion, encouraging Israel to constantly provoke border conflicts with Arab countries, unilaterally changing the course of the Jordan River, and refusing to resolve the Palestinian question, in order to achieve its shameful goal of controlling and enslaving the people of Arab countries.

　　It can be seen that the essence of the Palestinian question is the issue of aggression by imperialism and Zionism, led by the United States, versus the anti-aggression of the Palestinian Arab people and the people of Arab countries.

### 巴勒斯坦问题是美英帝国主义制造的

    巴勒斯坦问题是美英帝国主义制造的
    在亚洲西部，地中海东岸，有一块狭长的地带，这就是巴勒斯坦。这个地区面积二万五千多平方公里，处在欧、亚、非三洲的交通枢纽，又是伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯等国石油的出海口，因此在经济上和战略上都具有十分重要的地位。
    巴勒斯坦问题，表面上看来好象是阿拉伯人和犹太人的民族纠纷问题，其实是美英帝国主义一手挑拨和制造出来的。它们企图通过扶植反动的犹太复国主义，挑起阿拉伯人和犹太人的民族纠纷，在这里建立侵略的桥头堡，制造中东紧张局势，扼杀这一地区的民族解放运动，继续维持对巴勒斯坦和中东国家的殖民统治。
    早在公元前一千多年，犹太人曾经在巴勒斯坦地区建立过国家。后来，这些国家先后亡于亚述和巴比伦，犹太人开始向世界各地分散和流亡。从公元六、七世纪起，阿拉伯人就开始在巴勒斯坦定居下来。一千多年来，阿拉伯人始终统治着这块地方，并使整个地区阿拉伯化。这里的绝大多数居民都是阿拉伯人。
    第一次世界大战后，英国占领了巴勒斯坦，实行所谓“委任统治”，实际是把巴勒斯坦作为它控制中东、进而称霸世界的战略基地。当时巴勒斯坦有九万犹太人和六十六万阿拉伯人。为了对付阿拉伯人民的反抗，英帝国主义对巴勒斯坦采取了阴险的“分而治之”的殖民统治手法，即利用和扶植欧洲犹太资产阶级发起的“犹太复国主义运动”，开始把犹太人从世界各地移居到巴勒斯坦来。希特勒在德国建立法西斯政权后和第二次世界大战期间，欧洲犹太人遭到血腥的迫害。美英帝国主义利用这一形势，大规模地诱骗欧洲犹太人前往巴勒斯坦，让他们享受政治经济特权，借给他们各种新式武器，怂恿他们掠夺阿拉伯人的土地，驱逐阿拉伯人。
    第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义积极侵入巴勒斯坦，加紧与犹太复国主义者勾结，企图利用巴勒斯坦作为侵略和干涉亚洲和非洲的跳板。一九四七年，联合国在美国操纵下，违反阿拉伯人的意志，通过巴勒斯坦分治的决议，规定在巴勒斯坦建立阿拉伯人和犹太人两个独立国家，耶路撒冷市国际化。一九四八年五月十四日，犹太人建立以色列国，但阿拉伯人的国家没有成立。由于美英帝国主义的挑拨，以色列在成立后的第二天，也就是五月十五日，就向毗连的阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争，直到一九四九年二月才宣告停战。在战争期间，以色列侵占了大片土地，把原来控制的一万四千平方公里面积扩张到二万零七百平方公里，并占领耶路撒冷新城的大部分。
    不仅如此，以色列还把世世代代居住在巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人强行驱逐出境，无理没收他们的财产，使大批的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人沦为难民。据统计，难民总数为一百二十多万，其中散居约旦六十五万，阿联三十万，叙利亚、黎巴嫩各十多万。他们过着颠沛流离的生活，处境十分悲惨，他们坚决要求重返家园，建立和平生活。因此，难民问题成为巴勒斯坦问题中一个十分尖锐的问题。
    美帝国主义一贯支持以色列的侵略和扩张政策，怂恿以色列不断挑起和阿拉伯国家的边境冲突，单方面改变约旦河道，拒绝解决巴勒斯坦问题，借以达到它控制和奴役阿拉伯各国人民的可耻目的。
    由此可见，巴勒斯坦问题的实质，就是以美国为首的帝国主义和犹太复国主义的侵略与巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民的反侵略的问题。
