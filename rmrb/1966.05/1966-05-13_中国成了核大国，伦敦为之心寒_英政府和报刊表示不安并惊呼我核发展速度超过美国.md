    China Becomes a Nuclear Power, London is Alarmed
    British Government and Newspapers Express Anxiety and Exclaim that Our Nuclear Development Speed Exceeds that of the United States
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 11th – China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear material has caused unease among the British government and the bourgeois press.
    A British Foreign Office spokesman, on the 9th, issued a statement attacking China's nuclear test as "disappointing."
    Disarmament Minister Chalfont even advocated on the 10th, regarding China’s nuclear explosion, the conclusion of a "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" aimed at maintaining the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union. He said: "This Chinese explosion has increased the danger of nuclear proliferation, making it more urgent to arrange a treaty on this matter."
    The *Guardian's* editorial on the 10th had to admit that "China, like any other sovereign state, is entitled" to possess nuclear weapons. It said that the Chinese government has been "the target of American hostility for nearly twenty years"; and Soviet "hostility towards it has increased year by year," "China is one country in the world today that does not appear to completely exclude the possibility of being subjected to a nuclear attack." However, this newspaper also said that China's nuclear explosion to defend its national security and world peace "certainly will not help world security," and advocated using so-called conferences on preventing nuclear proliferation and disarmament to obstruct China from possessing the means of self-defense.
    The *Daily Telegraph's* editorial on the same day expressed unease about China's achievements in developing nuclear weapons. The editorial said: "Sooner or later the world will have to treat Communist China as a nuclear power. This prospect, although long anticipated, is chilling." The editorial also advocated using methods such as concluding a "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons" to restrict China's development of nuclear weapons.
    However, some British newspapers, while attacking China's nuclear test, had to admit China's great achievements in developing nuclear weapons. The *Financial Times* said on the 10th that the nuclear explosion on the 9th "further proves that China has made impressive progress in nuclear technology."
    This newspaper admitted that China conducted a nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear material within eighteen months of exploding its first atomic bomb, a process that took "the United States seven years, and Russia and Britain five years." The *Guardian* also admitted that this nuclear explosion "is undoubtedly a remarkable scientific and technological achievement." This newspaper also said that China "has consistently been ahead of predictions of their nuclear program."

    中国成了核大国，伦敦为之心寒
    英政府和报刊表示不安并惊呼我核发展速度超过美国
    新华社伦敦十一日电　中国成功地进行含有热核材料的核爆炸引起了英国政府和资产阶级报刊的不安。
    英国外交部发言人九日发表谈话，攻击中国的核试验“是令人失望的”。
    裁军大臣查尔方特十日还就中国这次核爆炸鼓吹缔结旨在保持美苏核垄断的“防止核扩散条约”。他说：“中国这次爆炸使得扩散核武器的危险扩大了，就此安排一项条约更有迫切需要了。”
    《卫报》十日的社论不得不承认，“中国象其他任何主权国家一样有资格”拥有核武器。它说，中国政府是美国“近二十年敌视的目标”；而苏联“对它的敌视也逐年增加”，“中国是今天世界上看来不完全排除遭到核攻击的一个国家”。但是，这家报纸又说什么中国为保卫祖国安全和世界和平而进行核爆炸“肯定不会对世界安全有什么帮助”，而鼓吹以所谓防止核扩散和裁军的会议来阻挠中国拥有自卫手段。
    《每日电讯报》同一天的社论对中国发展核武器的成就表示不安。社论说：“迟早世界得把共产党中国作为一个核大国对待。这种前景虽然是老早预料到的，却是令人寒心的。”社论也鼓吹用缔结“防止核扩散条约”等办法来束缚中国发展核武器。
    但是，一些英国报纸在攻击中国核试验的同时，不得不承认中国在发展核武器方面的巨大成就。《金融时报》十日说，九日的核爆炸“进一步证明中国在核技术方面取得了给人深刻印象的进展”。
    这家报纸承认，中国在爆炸第一个原子弹以后的十八个月内就进行了含有热核材料的核爆炸，而这个过程在“美国花了七年时间，俄国和英国花了五年”。《卫报》也承认，这次核爆炸“无疑是一个惊人的科学技术成就”。这家报纸还说，中国“一直跑在人们对他们的核计划的预测的前头”。
