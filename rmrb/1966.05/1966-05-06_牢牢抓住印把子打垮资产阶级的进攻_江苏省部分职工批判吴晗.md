    On the afternoon of April 23rd, the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Philosophy and Social Sciences invited some workers to a symposium to criticize Wu Han. Ten people from ten units, including Nanjing Iron and Steel Plant, Nanjing Cotton and Wool Textile Factory, and Liu Hua Chun Restaurant, participated in the symposium. The workers spoke enthusiastically and eagerly. They expressed their clear love and hatred, denounced Wu Han's crimes against the Party and socialism, poured out their love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the struggle, and eliminate poisonous weeds.

      Wu Han Chimes in With Enemies at Home and Abroad Attempting to Overthrow Socialism

    The ten speakers unanimously agreed that Wu Han colluded with class enemies at home and abroad, echoing each other in an attempt to undermine socialism. Hu Changling from Liu Hua Chun Restaurant said, "When I read the materials about Wu Han in the newspaper, I was very angry at his crimes against the Party and socialism; I was also very happy to see that he was being criticized all over the country." He also said, "Wu Han served bourgeois politics and was a bourgeois agent who had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. He shared the same views as right-leaning opportunists, stood on a reactionary position, sang a tune against our Party and socialism, and engaged in capitalist restoration." Guo Shaojiang from Chenguang Machinery Factory said, "From 1959 to 1961, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries launched an anti-China chorus internationally. Domestic right-leaning opportunists also took advantage of our country's temporary difficulties to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. At this time, Wu Han wrote 'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' to cheer them on; after the right-leaning opportunists were defeated by us, Wu Han broke out and wrote 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' to speak up for them, encouraging them to try again after their failure. This is an extra-large poisonous weed!" Yu Hua from Nanjing Gengxin Department Store said, "Wu Han used the name of 'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' to scold our Party and our socialism." She questioned Wu Han, "What is wrong with socialism? In just sixteen years since liberation, we have developed atomic bombs and a 12,000-ton hydraulic press. Isn't that good? The Party and Chairman Mao liberated the vast majority of poor people, and girls from poor families like me can also learn culture and participate in work. Isn't that good? What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what kind of words. Wu Han is completely speaking from the bourgeois standpoint." Yu Xiuwen from Nanjing Railway Bureau said, "What Wu Han wrote is the revival of dead souls. We want socialist collective economy, landlords and rich peasants want to go it alone, Wu Han wants to return land, isn't this Wu Han singing a different tune from the Communist Party? Isn't this Wu Han advising the four categories of elements?" Zhou Haiqing from Nanjing Radio Factory further exposed Wu Han, saying, "He is hanging a sheep's head to sell dog meat, wearing the cloak of a Marxist-Leninist scholar, and using literary forms to incite and help right-leaning opportunists, dreaming of overthrowing the socialist system and letting landlords and capitalists ride on our backs again. This is daydreaming, this is a toad wanting to eat swan meat, it is impossible."

  Don't Forget Class Struggle, Defeat the Bourgeoisie's Attack

    Yuan Zunan from Huohua Glass Factory, Zhao Fenggui from Zhan Dou Machinery Factory, Gao Busheng from Nanjing Electron Tube Factory and other comrades all believed that Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist behavior was not accidental. He was the favorite student of the most reactionary Hu Shi. For decades, he hung the signboard of a history expert, but in reality, he was an expert who admired the United States, was pro-Chiang, and anti-Communist. Hu Chuanjiu from Nanjing Machinery Factory said, "Wu Han in the 1960s is the same as Wu Han in the 1930s, the difference is that the current Wu Han is more cunning and more dangerous." He said, "Because our regime is relatively consolidated and Mao Zedong Thought is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, these guys like Wu Han do not dare to attack openly, they can only carry out their restoration activities in a disguised way by pointing at the mulberry tree and scolding the locust tree. This shows that class struggle is complex. We must firmly grasp the key link of class struggle and fight against all kinds of enemies." Hu Changling said, "Wu Han's 'Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor' and 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' are also very good negative teaching materials for us. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, always highlight politics, firmly grasp the seal of power, and resolutely defeat the bourgeoisie's attack!"

      Distinguishing Between the Enemy and Ourselves is the Primary Issue of the Revolution

    The workers also believed that both "honest officials" and corrupt officials are equally bad villains. Cao Aju from Nanjing Cotton and Wool Textile Factory said from her own experience, "I have been working in factories since I was a child, and I know what kind of people capitalists and their lackeys are. All capitalists want to exploit workers, that goes without saying. What about those second bosses who work for the capitalists? True, from the phenomenon, one type bares its fangs and claws at the workers, beating and scolding them; and another type seems to be more 'amiable', sometimes giving the workers a fake smile. But what is the reality? They are all the same. One is a robber, and the other is a liar." Hu Changling said, "I am over fifty years old, and I have been working as an apprentice in a factory since I was sixteen years old. Until liberation, I have never seen a good capitalist. All crows under the sky are black, there is no cat that doesn't eat fish, there is no such thing as an 'honest official'?" Guo Shaojiang excitedly said, "Chairman Mao told us: 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is the primary question of the revolution.' Wu Han actually puts powder on feudal rulers and smears the faces of the working people! He vainly attempts to confuse the line between the enemy and ourselves and abolish class struggle." Yu Hua also said, "Wu Han put Hai Rui on the stage. May I ask Wu Han: Where do you want to lead our youth?" She said, "Wu Han brought out this corpse just to use it as a tool to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Marxism-Leninism. We must not be fooled!"

  We Will Never Stop Fighting Until We Achieve Complete Victory

    Finally, the worker comrades solemnly pointed out: "Tell Wu Han, the workers are conscious and have sharp eyes. No matter what monsters and demons, we can catch them!" Gao Busheng said, "I am an old worker with thirty years of seniority. Although I am not very literate and I don't understand what academics are, I will be irreconcilable with anyone who attacks the Party, and I will resolutely oppose him." He said, "We workers resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, we will do what Chairman Mao says. We must uproot poisonous weeds, and we will never stop fighting until we achieve complete victory!" Hu Changling said, "The Party is our only savior, and Chairman Mao is our red sun. We will not allow anyone to attack and slander our great Party, our great Chairman Mao, and our great socialism. Today, we workers who have turned over and mastered the great Mao Zedong Thought can defeat you whether you come with force or words, whether you come openly or secretly." Zhou Haiqing said, "Anyone who wants to be an enemy of the people will be bruised and battered. Please remember the fate of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique and the Feng Xuefeng rightists, bourgeois gentlemen! This is a mirror for Wu Han." Yu Hua said, "All history has been reversed by the likes of Wu Han. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to rewrite history and restore history to its original appearance. We will never allow Wu Han to plant poisonous weeds in the socialist flower garden!" Cao Aju said, "The time has come for workers to speak out. In the past, workers were beaten and scolded by capitalists, and could only cry in the corner or under the covers. Today is different, we have the right to speak. I am the union group leader, and I will not only fight against Wu Han, I will also mobilize all comrades in the group to fight against these bad guys when I go back. I tell Wu Han: We workers have the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, our eyes are sharp, and our consciousness is high. No matter how poisonous something is, we can recognize it. We workers have the power to crush you!"

### 牢牢抓住印把子打垮资产阶级的进攻  江苏省部分职工批判吴晗

    牢牢抓住印把子打垮资产阶级的进攻
    江苏省部分职工批判吴晗
    四月二十三日下午，江苏省哲学、社会科学联合会邀请部分工人举行了一次批判吴晗的座谈会。参加座谈会的有南京钢铁厂、南京棉毛纺织厂、六华春菜馆等十个单位，共十人。会上工人们发言热烈，争先恐后。他们爱憎分明，痛斥吴晗反党反社会主义的罪行，倾吐对党对毛主席的热爱，并且决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加战斗，锄掉毒草。
      吴晗与国内外敌人一唱一和企图搞垮社会主义
    十个人的发言，一致认为吴晗与国内外的阶级敌人里应外合，一唱一和，企图搞垮社会主义。六华春菜馆胡长龄说：“我在报上看到吴晗的材料，对他反党反社会主义的罪行，十分气愤；看到全国各地都来批判他，心里又十分痛快。”他还说：“吴晗是为资产阶级政治服务的，是混入革命队伍中的资产阶级代理人，与右倾机会主义分子一鼻孔出气，站在反动的立场上，同我们党、同社会主义唱反调，搞资本主义复辟。”晨光机械厂郭绍江说：“一九五九年至一九六一年，国际上帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派掀起了反华大合唱，国内的右倾机会主义分子也利用我国的暂时困难，向党猖狂进攻，这时吴晗写了《海瑞骂皇帝》为他们助威；当右倾机会主义者被我们打下去后，吴晗破门而出写了《海瑞罢官》为他们打不平，鼓励他们失败再干。这是一棵特大号的毒草！”南京更新百货店余华说：“吴晗借《海瑞骂皇帝》之名，来骂我们的党，骂我们的社会主义。”她责问吴晗：“社会主义那点不好？解放只有十六年就有了原子弹和一万二千吨的水压机，难道说这不好吗？党和毛主席解放了广大贫苦人民，象我这样穷人家出身的女孩子也能学到了文化、参加了工作，难道说这不好吗？什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话，吴晗完全是站在资产阶级立场上说话的。”南京铁路局俞秀文说：“吴晗写的东西是借尸还魂。我们要社会主义集体经济，地富要单干，吴晗要退田，这不是吴晗和共产党唱对台戏吗？这不是吴晗给四类分子出谋献计吗？”南京无线电厂周海清进一步揭露吴晗说：“他是挂羊头卖狗肉，披着马列主义学者的外衣，利用文艺形式来煽动、帮助右倾机会主义分子，梦想推翻社会主义制度，让地主、资本家重新骑在我们头上，这是白天做梦，这是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，办不到的。”
  不忘阶级斗争、打垮资产阶级的进攻
    火花玻璃厂袁祖南、战斗机械厂赵逢贵、南京电子管厂高步生等同志都认为：吴晗反党反社会主义，并不是偶然的。他是最反动的胡适的得意门生，几十年来，他挂着史学专家的招牌，实际上却是崇美、亲蒋、反共的专家。南京机械厂胡传九说：“六十年代的吴晗与三十年代的吴晗一样，不同的是：现在的吴晗更加狡猾，更加危险了。”他说：“因为我们的政权相当巩固，毛泽东思想深入人心，吴晗这些家伙不敢明目张胆地进攻，只有用指桑骂槐的隐蔽方式进行他们的复辟活动，这说明阶级斗争复杂了。我们要紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲，和各式各样的敌人作斗争。”胡长龄说：“吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》对我们也是很好的反面教材，我们要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，不要忘记阶级斗争，永远突出政治，牢牢抓住印把子，坚决打垮资产阶级的进攻！”
      分清敌我是革命的首要问题
    工人们还认为：“清官”、贪官，都是一样的大坏蛋。南京棉毛纺织厂曹阿菊以自己的亲身体会说：“我从小就进工厂做工，我知道资本家以及为资本家服务的狗腿子是什么样的人。凡是资本家都要剥削工人的，这点不用说了。那些为资本家办事的二老板怎样呢？不错，从现象上看，一种是对工人张牙舞爪，打骂都来；还有一种好象是‘和气’点，对工人有时也来点皮笑肉不笑，实际怎么样？半斤八两。一个是强盗，一个是骗子。”胡长龄说：“我五十多岁了，从十六岁进厂当学徒，直到解放前，我没有看到一个好资本家。天下乌鸦一般黑，那有猫儿不吃腥，那有什么‘清官’？”郭绍江激动地说：“毛主席告诉我们：‘谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。’吴晗竟然给封建统治者搽粉，在劳动人民脸上抹黑！他妄想混淆敌我界限，取消阶级斗争。”余华也说：“吴晗把海瑞搬上舞台，试问吴晗：你要把我们青年引到那里去？”她说：“吴晗搬出这具死尸，只不过是借此来做反党、反社会主义、反马克思列宁主义的工具罢了，我们不能上当！”
  不获全胜决不收兵
    最后，工人同志们严肃地指出：“告诉吴晗，工人是有觉悟的，眼睛是雪亮的，不管什么妖魔鬼怪，我们都能揪住！”高步生说：“我是一个工龄三十年的老工人，虽然识字不多，也不懂什么学术不学术，但谁要攻击党，我就与他势不两立，就要坚决反对他。”他说：“我们工人坚决听毛主席的话，毛主席怎样说的，我们就怎样做。毒草，我们一定要连根拔掉，不获全胜，决不收兵！”胡长龄说：“党是我们唯一的救星，毛主席是我们的红太阳。我们不容许任何人对我们伟大的党、伟大的毛主席、伟大的社会主义进行攻击和污蔑。今天我们翻了身的工人，掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，不问你是武来，还是文来，不问你是明来，还是暗来，都可以击败的。”周海清说：“谁要和人民为敌，谁就要碰得头破血流，请这些资产阶级老爷们记住胡风反革命集团和冯雪峰右派的下场吧！这就是吴晗的一面镜子。”余华说：“全部历史被吴晗之流颠倒了，我们要以毛泽东思想为指导，重新写历史，还历史本来面目。我们决不容许吴晗在社会主义花坛上栽毒草！”曹阿菊说：“工人说话的时机到了，过去工人被资本家打骂，只有到墙角里或者钻到被窝里去哭，今天不同了，我们有说话的权利。我是工会小组长，不仅我要和吴晗斗，我回去也要发动全组同志和这些坏蛋斗。我告诉吴晗：我们工人有毛泽东思想这个锐利武器，眼睛是雪亮的，觉悟是高的，再毒的东西，我们也能识别出来，我们工人有力量粉碎你！”
