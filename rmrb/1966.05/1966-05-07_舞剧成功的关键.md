    The opera "The White-Haired Girl" is an excellent work from the period of China's New Democratic Revolution, and it has had a tremendous impact on the broad masses of people. Now, the comrades of the Shanghai Dance School have adapted it into a ballet. Under the leadership of the Party, and based on Chairman Mao's ideas on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, as well as his analysis of the class nature of poor peasants, they re-examined and re-created the work. They prominently demonstrated the resistance and revolutionary spirit of the poor peasants, and they threaded the Party's leadership and the rural armed struggle as a red line throughout the entire drama. This made the image of the poor peasants in the drama more typical and greater, and the theme of the play higher and deeper. In terms of form, they critically inherited the art forms of foreign ballet and Chinese folk dance and opera dance. They proceeded from life in everything, for the sake of portraying workers, peasants, and soldiers in everything, and for the sake of portraying class struggle in everything. They used the past for the present and foreign things for Chinese use, bravely breaking the foreign constraints of ballet, constantly revolutionizing, and constantly creating, making outstanding achievements in the revolutionization, nationalization, and massification of ballet. The creations in composition, music, and stage art are also excellent!
    After seeing it, I particularly loved the revisions to the characters of Xi'er and Yang Bailao. The work removed the scene in the original opera where Xi'er was raped, and strengthened their character of daring to struggle and daring to resist. The depiction of Xi'er's struggle life in the mountains, and the changes in the several scenes from black hair to white hair, show the growth process of Xi'er's character, which is both rich in life-like reality and has a strong revolutionary romanticism.
    Watching the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" was a profound education in Mao Zedong Thought. My excited mood could not calm down for a long time, and I couldn't help but recall the various scenes of participating in the creation, rehearsal, and performance of the new opera "The White-Haired Girl" at Lu Yi in Yan'an in the past. I repeatedly thought about a question: In the past, when we created and rehearsed the opera "The White-Haired Girl," we also emphasized class and class struggle, and we also created with incomparable hatred for the landlord class and deep sympathy for the poor peasants. Why didn't we express Xi'er and Yang Bailao's resistance and revolutionary spirit strongly enough in the past? Why were we unable to shape these images of poor peasants more typically, completely, and greatly at that time? The most important reason is that at that time we (especially myself) studied Mao Zedong Thought too poorly. We had not yet achieved using Mao Zedong Thought to guide creation at all times, in all places, and in all things. Furthermore, we had not yet deeply immersed ourselves in the reality of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary struggle, and we were not yet familiar enough with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, although we had read some of Chairman Mao's books at that time, we could not understand the spiritual essence of Chairman Mao's words.
    At that time, in my mind, there was only the image of peasants suffering, humiliated, and persecuted in the old society, and there was no image of revolutionary peasants who dared to resist and struggle. Therefore, we could not create a great image of a revolutionary hero.
    In the past, in Yan'an and behind enemy lines, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers had opinions about the image of Xi'er, feeling that as a typical image of poor peasants, there were still shortcomings. We also felt that the image of Xi'er was not ideal enough. However, this problem has not been resolved for a long time. This is because our ideological transformation was not enough at that time, and we lacked the ideological feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Here, I once again realize how important it is for art workers to study Mao Zedong Thought and to highlight politics in artistic creation. If one's worldview is not transformed well, and if one neglects ideological transformation in the creative process, it is impossible to do a good job of creation. If one is not familiar with or does not understand the object of expression when engaging in creation, problems and deviations will inevitably occur. If we do not use Mao Zedong Thought to observe, experience, analyze, and study life, and to carry out creation, we will not see or see clearly the essence and mainstream of life. If we do not delve into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and do not personally participate in the hot reality of struggle, and do not feel the revolutionary spirit of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we cannot establish great heroic images for workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this way, our creation cannot be said to be a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Without using Mao Zedong Thought to carry out creation, it is impossible to create works with a high degree of unity of politics and art.
    Of course, there are still places in the work that can be further processed. For example, the formation process of Yang Bailao's rebellious character seems to be portrayed more fully, and the final struggle meeting seems to be expressed more powerfully.
    The creators of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" are all very young comrades. Its tremendous success is not accidental. It is a product of our great socialist revolutionary era. It was produced in the era when Comrade Mao Zedong highly developed Marxism-Leninism, in the era when Mao Zedong Thought has become the highest instruction for us to engage in all work, and in the era when the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and art workers are working hard to study and are beginning to gradually master Mao Zedong Thought! It is precisely because the comrades of the Shanghai Dance School have worked hard to study Mao Zedong Thought that they have used Mao Zedong Thought as the highest instruction for all work at all times, in all places, and in all things throughout the entire creative process that they have created such an artistic work full of the spirit of the socialist era!

    舞剧成功的关键
    舒强
    歌剧《白毛女》是我国新民主主义革命时期的一部优秀作品，在广大人民群众中有着巨大影响。现在上海市舞蹈学校的同志们把它改编为芭蕾舞剧。他们在党的领导下，根据毛主席的关于阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的思想和对贫农的阶级性的分析，重新认识，重新创造，突出地表现了贫农的反抗性和革命性，把党的领导和农村武装斗争作为一条红线贯串全剧，使剧中的贫农形象更典型、更高大，使剧本的主题思想更高、更深。在形式上，他们批判地继承了外国芭蕾舞和我国民间舞蹈、戏曲舞蹈等艺术形式。他们一切从生活出发，一切为了表现工农兵，一切为了表现阶级斗争，古为今用、外为中用，勇敢地打破了芭蕾舞的洋框框，不断革命，不断创造，在芭蕾舞剧革命化，民族化，群众化方面作出了优异的成绩。在作曲、音乐和舞台美术方面的创造，也都是好样的！
    我看了以后，特别喜爱关于喜儿和杨白劳的形象的修改。作品去掉了原歌剧中喜儿受奸污的情节，加强了他们的敢于斗争，敢于反抗的性格。喜儿在山中的斗争生活的描绘，从黑发到白发的几个场面的变化，表现了喜儿性格的成长过程，既富于生活真实，又具有浓厚的革命浪漫主义色彩。
    看芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，受了一次深刻的毛泽东思想的教育，激动的心情长久不能平静，不由得回忆起过去在延安鲁艺时参加新歌剧《白毛女》的创作、排演和演出的种种情景。我反复地想着一个问题：过去，我们创作和排演歌剧《白毛女》时，也是强调了阶级和阶级斗争，也是怀着对地主阶级无比仇恨、对贫农的深厚同情去创造的，为什么从前我们把喜儿和杨白劳的反抗性和革命性表现得不够强烈呢？为什么当时我们没能把这些贫农的形象塑造得更典型、更完整、更高大呢？其最重要的原因，是当时我们（尤其是我自己）对毛泽东思想学习太差。还没有做到时时、处处、事事都以毛泽东思想来指导创作。更由于我们那时还没有很好地深入工农兵和革命斗争实际，还不太熟悉工农兵的思想和感情。所以尽管那时也读了点毛主席的书，可是就不能懂得毛主席的话的精神实质。
    那时，在自己的脑子里，只有过去旧社会的受苦、受污辱、受迫害的农民形象，还没有革命的、敢于反抗和斗争的农民形象。所以，也就塑造不出革命英雄的高大形象。
    过去在延安和敌后时，工农兵群众对于喜儿的形象就有过意见，觉得作为贫农的典型形象，还有美中不足之处。我们也曾感到喜儿的形象还不够理想。但是，这个问题长期以来未能解决。这是由于当时我们的思想改造不够，缺少工农兵的思想感情。
    这里，我再一次认识到，艺术工作者学习毛泽东思想和在艺术创作中突出政治是多么重要。世界观未改造好，在创作过程中若是忽略了思想改造，创作就不可能搞好。搞创作，若是对表现的对象不熟悉，不懂，就一定会出问题，出偏差。不能以毛泽东思想去观察、体验、分析、研究生活，去进行创作，就看不到或看不清生活的本质和主流，不深入工农兵生活，不亲身参与火热的斗争实际，感受不到工农兵的革命精神，就不能为工农兵树立起高大的英雄形象，这样，我们的创作也就谈不上革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合。不以毛泽东思想来进行创作，就不可能创造出政治性和艺术性高度统一的作品来。
    当然，作品也还有可以进一步加工的地方，例如，杨白劳的反抗性格的形成过程，似乎可以刻划得更充分一些；最后一场的斗争会似乎可以表现得更有力一些。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的创作者都是很年青的同志，它能获得如此巨大的成功，不是偶然的。它是我们这个伟大的社会主义革命时代的产物，它是产生在毛泽东同志高度发展了马克思列宁主义的时代，是产生在毛泽东思想已经成为我们从事一切工作的最高指示的时代，是产生在广大的工农兵群众和革命的文艺工作者正在努力学习并开始逐渐掌握毛泽东思想的时代！正因为上海市舞蹈学校的同志努力学习了毛泽东思想，他们在整个创作过程中，时时，处处，事事都以毛泽东思想作一切工作的最高指示，才创作出如此富于社会主义时代精神的艺术作品来！
