    Emphasize Politics, Use Mao Zedong Thought to Mobilize the Revolutionary Enthusiasm of the People of the Whole County
    -- On the Solidan County Party Committee, Hebei Province, Breaking the Old Ideology of Valuing “Fat” and Neglecting “Lean” and Strengthening Political Leadership in Backward Areas
    Editor's Note: The revolutionization of the county committee's leadership starts with the ideological revolutionization of the county committee members. This is a class struggle in the ideological field. The article "Emphasize Politics, Use Mao Zedong Thought to Mobilize the Revolutionary Enthusiasm of the People of the Whole County," published in this newspaper today, raises the question of how to solve the ideological revolutionization of the county committee's leadership from one aspect.
    A county committee is the headquarters for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and leading the people of the whole county in socialist revolution and socialist construction. The fundamental task of this headquarters is to emphasize politics, emphasize Mao Zedong Thought, and do a good job in the revolutionization of people. In order to realize this great task, the comrades of the county committee must first dig out all bourgeois and feudal class ideological influences from the depths of their souls. Only by revolutionizing oneself can one lead the people of the whole county to make revolution and plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts.
    The "valuing 'fat' and neglecting 'lean'" and "valuing the south and neglecting the north" thinking in the leadership ideology of the CPC Solidan County Committee actually reflects the old "dislike the poor and love the rich" thinking in the minds of some comrades of the county committee. "Disliking the poor," "fearing the poor," and "looking down on the poor," and regarding "poverty" as a burden is a reflection of the ideology of the exploiting classes in people's minds. After the comrades of the Solidan County Committee cleared such thinking, they used the class analysis method taught by Comrade Mao Zedong to conduct class analysis of the northern poor and backward areas, and carried out class education for the broad masses of commune members, greatly invigorating the revolutionary spirit of the people. They began to understand the great truth of Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching that "poverty gives rise to the desire for change," and made work arrangements in line with the spirit of the Party's general line for socialist construction, achieving considerable results.
    There are many similar living ideas in various places. We hope that the county committee comrades will bravely dig out the old ideas in the leadership ideology during the Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, consciously arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the socialist revolution to the end in the economic, political, ideological, and cultural fields.
    The concepts of north and south, or east and west, are all geographical concepts. Due to different geographical conditions, natural conditions also have advantages and disadvantages. Some places are better in the south and worse in the north, and some places are better in the east and worse in the west. In the process of leading revolutionization, how can a county committee break free from the shackles of old habitual thinking, see the good places and also see the bad places, regardless of north and south, regardless of "fat" or "lean," without harboring partiality, but emphasizing politics and comprehensively strengthening political leadership? This is a major issue for the county committee to achieve leadership revolutionization.
    Take Solidan County in the Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area as an example. For thousands of years, the Yongding River has created a different situation in the north and south of this county. The north relies on the Yongding River. When the river floods, it brings down mud and sand. The sand is heavy and the mud is light, so more sand stays in the north and more mud silts up in the south. The north is sandy and barren, and the south is fertile. In the leadership ideology of the Solidan County Committee, there has long been a view of the south being fat and the north being lean. In practice, this has formed a policy of using the south to support the north and transferring grain from the south to the north.
    Where is the emphasis on the south and neglect of the north manifested?
    Most of the cadres sent to the countryside went to the south, and none of the main responsible comrades and standing committee members of the county committee squatted in the north.
    More than 80% of production investment and production materials are used in the south.
    Before 1965, more than 500 mechanized wells were dug in the county, more than 90% of which were in the south.
    When the county committee held meetings to study work, the focus of production was on the south, and the focus of unified sales of grain and relief funds was on the north.
    The two brigades in the county that attended the provincial agricultural advanced unit representative meeting were both in the south, and nine of the ten advanced brigades on the prefectural committee list were in the south.
    When carrying out drainage projects, under the guidance of the idea of valuing the south and neglecting the north, the natural flow of water was violated, resulting in flooding in the north and no guarantee in the south.
    Commune cadres also believe that working in the south is promising and has a future, and being transferred from the south to the north is not glorious.
    The most fundamental aspect of the ideological revolutionization of the county committee's leadership is whether it consciously uses Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the whole county. In a socialist society, class struggle permeates every corner. Poor and lower-middle peasants everywhere want revolution. How can the county committee lead the people to make revolution and be restricted by the "fatness" and "leanness" of the region? How can they value "fat" and neglect "lean," and value the south and neglect the north?
    The old geographical concept has long been broken by the revolutionary reality. The Yongding River was historically called the Wuding River (Unstable River). In the old society, although the ruling class renamed it the Yongding River (Eternally Stable River), it was still a frequently flooding "Unstable River." In the sixteen years since liberation, especially after the Guanting Reservoir was built, the Yongding River has truly been "eternally stable," and water damage has been turned into water conservancy. Socialism is changing the face of nature. However, without self-revolution of people's minds, they cannot correctly understand the new natural phenomena. They do not understand that the sandy land in the north created by the Yongding River can already be eaten away by the people piece by piece like a dead tiger. Every piece of sand that is controlled is one piece less. Socialist Solidan County can no longer be at the mercy of the Yongding River. The natural conditions for building a socialist economy in northern Solidan are ripe, but why hasn't the situation in the north fundamentally changed? Is the north really as bad as some people think? Absolutely not.
    There is more sand in the north. This is a headache. Many people regard sand as an insurmountable enemy in the north. In fact, sand is just a temporary natural phenomenon. What's so great about it? According to historical records, this large area of sandy land used to be a granary before the Ming Dynasty. The sand accumulated with the flooding of the Yongding River. Socialist revolution and construction is to solve the problems that the predecessors dreamed of solving but could not solve. Turning sandy land into fertile land is the essence of the problem. After ideological revolutionization, the Solidan County Committee sent people to the north to conduct actual investigations, and obtained many new views on sandy land.
    It turns out that the sand in the northern region is only a little over a foot thick, and the thickest is no more than two or three feet. Under the sand is fertile clay soil. As long as the clay soil below is turned up and mixed with sand, it becomes fertile land. Li Zhihe, secretary of the Solidan County Committee, said: "The people of Dazhai are fighting against nature by hitting stones. We are going to control the sand. Changing sand is much easier than moving stones. But without ideological revolution, you can't see it and you can't do it."
    Without ideological revolution, you only see the south and not the north, you only see things and not people. You only see the poverty in the north, but you don't see that the people want to revolutionize poverty. Revolution can create its own path. Chengguan Commune is a place that has long been eating state-supplied grain and receiving relief funds, but there is a bright pearl of the northern region – Xiaosun Guo Brigade – only four miles away from the county seat. This brigade has only seventy households. Since 1961, it has been digging soil to cushion the land. In the past five years, more than half of the 700 mu of land has been transformed, and more than 700 mu of economic forests have been created. Fruit trees and economic forests began to yield benefits last year. In 1960, this team had only one old horse and three pigs; the members had to eat 50,000 jin of grain from the state every year. In 1965, the total grain output was more than 190,000 jin, and the members and the collective had reserves, and also sold 20,000 jin to the state; the number of livestock increased to more than 30, including 13 mules and horses, and the number of pigs also increased to more than 100. Now they are using thousands of acres of sandy land to cultivate large areas of forest belts. Xiaosun Guo Brigade is Dazhai in northern Solidan. Why didn't the county committee summarize the experience well, spread it widely, and set up this banner high? The idea of neglecting the north has made them suffer from political color blindness.
    It seems that it is not the geographical conditions that are backward, nor are the masses of the people; what is backward is the leadership, is the thinking of the leadership. To transform the backward, we must first start by transforming the backward thinking of the county committee. What views need to be clarified among the leading comrades of the county committee?
    "Valuing the south and neglecting the north" is because "the south is fat and the north is lean." How to view "fat" and "lean"?
    According to socialist requirements, the standard of "fat" is first and foremost a political standard. Where class struggle is taken as the key link, the class line is implemented, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members is mobilized, the socialist economy there will be greatly developed. From the perspective of production, there are roughly two lines: one is that grain output meets the "Program" and exceeds the "Program." The other is that diversified operations develop well, providing funds for agriculture and increasing income for farmers. It seems that the "fat" of the southern region is not "fat" enough. They focused on grain and did not focus on diversified operations for expanding reproduction. Now that the south is engaged in agricultural modernization and needs to invest funds, it is found that the "foundation" is insufficient. However, the so-called "fat" in the past only reflects the "fat" of small-scale peasant economic thinking, focusing only on eating and not on building large-scale socialist agriculture. Therefore, the saying that the south is "fat" is not comprehensive. Only when the southern economy is fully developed can it be called truly "fat."
    How to view the "leanness" of the north? As mentioned earlier, the land in the north, after being transformed, is no worse than the south. As the saying goes: "Sand mixed with clay is better than gold." After the Socialist Education Movement, the sandy land of the Xiaoliangqu Brigade has not yet been transformed. It has only reached 403 jin per mu last year due to the promotion of improved varieties and increased manure, reaching the "Program" standard. The county committee vigorously promoted this experience. People who were considered to be "justified" in eating state-supplied grain in the past are no longer "justified." The saying that "ancestors produced one stone per mu for three generations" has been broken. Meeting the "Program" in terms of output is both visible and tangible in the north. From the perspective of developing diversified operations, the conditions in the north are much better than in the south. More land is the most important thing. On average, there are more than three mu of land per person, including more than two mu of farmland, one mu of forest, and a lot of idle land. Sandy land can be used to grow peanuts, osier, etc. Secondly, people have expertise in various sideline occupations such as willow weaving. In the old society, this was a means for people to make a living. Now it has become an important condition for providing funds for agricultural modernization.
    Obviously, the view of the south being "fat" and the north being "lean" is lagging behind the revolutionary situation. Under the guidance of the idea of neglecting "lean" and valuing "fat," it is impossible to have "fat" that meets the requirements of socialist standards, and it is impossible to correctly solve the problem of "lean" by emphasizing politics. We must not look at problems with the "snobbish eyes" left over from the old society, but correctly solve the problem of the south being rich and the north being poor from the class point of view. Only by looking at it from the Party's class stand can we avoid being confused by superficial phenomena, grasp the main aspects of the contradiction, and promote all positive factors of the people to seek "fat" from "lean" and achieve comprehensive development of the socialist economy.
    Some people believe that since the conditions in the south are good and there is a lot of oil and water, is there anything wrong with focusing on the south?
    In a certain period, it is right to concentrate manpower and material resources to build the south into a stable and high-yield production base and to increase grain production as soon as possible. In the past few years, under the leadership of the county committee, the masses in the south have made positive contributions to the country in grain production and have given strong support to the class brothers in the north, which should be affirmed. However, as the fighting headquarters of the people of the whole county, the most fundamental task of the county committee is to emphasize politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the whole county, and make full use of the material resources of the whole county to build a socialist county. If grain production in the south goes up, the north will be more likely to go up. If the focus is isolated, only focusing on the key points and ignoring the rest, this is not right. Supporting the north with the south increases the burden on the south, and the north feels that it has no role and status. As a result, the enthusiasm of both the north and the south is restricted and not fully mobilized.
    The cadres and masses in the north have opinions on three issues: First, drainage projects have been carried out, but flooding is still unavoidable. In the past, when it rained heavily, the water could flow smoothly to the south. In recent years, the north, located upstream, has also been flooded. Second, they have not been led to increase grain production. If grain production does not go up, nothing is done proactively. Third, the county committee leaders rarely run to the north. They said that it would be a great encouragement for the county committee to come here to take a look. The county committee believes that these opinions are correct. After ideological revolutionization, more cadres have been running to the north. The masses are very satisfied with this change in the county committee leadership. The masses said: The northern region has great potential. This place is not only a large granary, but also has many ways to engage in diversified operations. If it is done well, there will be five autumns a year: wheat autumn, apricot autumn, willow autumn, autumn harvest, and pear autumn. As long as the county committee leads the way, we will sell some strength and change our appearance in three to five years.
    Some people's understanding of key points is one-sided. They only focus on key areas and ignore non-key areas. This is abandoning leadership. If socialism abandons the ideological and production fronts, capitalism will take the opportunity. In the past few years, capitalist spontaneous tendencies in several communes in the northern region have developed to some extent. The direction of sideline occupations is not correct, and a few people benefit, while the collective and most commune members benefit little. The Socialist Education Movement was launched, and the capitalist spontaneous forces were strongly attacked. One of the county leaders, who had been squatting in the south for a long time, recently transferred to the north. Seeing the production situation here, he said with emotion: "In the past, I knew too little about the north. Compared with the south, the north is a few years behind."
    Some people believe that the south has a good foundation and develops quickly, while the north has poor conditions and cannot be improved for a while. Therefore, attention should be focused on the south.
    There is a saying of "splitting the harness of two horses": If two horses are pulling a cart, one is strong and the other is weak. The weak horse drags the strong horse, affecting the speed of the cart; it is better to split the harness and let the single horse go alone.
      "Two horses harnessed together" or "two horses splitting the harness"? This is a major issue of whether to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically, or less, slower, worse, and more expensively. It is an important issue related to the correct implementation of the general line. To build socialism and implement the general line, it can only be "two horses harnessed together," running side by side and advancing together. In this way, the strength and speed will be doubled, which is the real more, faster, better, and more economical.
    Although the south develops quickly, it is only a period of fast, and only a local fast. Local does not equal the whole. From the overall point of view, the growth rate of the whole county before 1965 was actually slow. For more than ten years, under the guidance of the idea of "valuing the south and neglecting the north" and "supporting the north with the south," Solidan's grain output has long remained at around 80 million jin, the so-called "old 80 million" level, and has not been able to increase significantly. During the Socialist Education Movement in 1965, the leaders of this county initially changed their understanding of valuing the south and neglecting the north and began to focus on the north. The total grain output of the county increased significantly, reaching 125 million jin, an increase of more than 30% compared with 1964. Without the large-scale increase in production in the northern region, such a speed would be impossible.
    Taking the Beima Village, Chengguan, and Zhiziying communes, the three communes with the worst conditions in the north, as an example, the grain output of these three communes in 1965 was 15.88 million jin, an increase of 88% compared with 1964. Many production teams that had been eating state-supplied grain for a long time achieved self-sufficiency, and many teams had reserve grain for the first time. The situation of "supporting the north with the south" began to turn around. Simultaneous increase in production in the south and north laid a strong material foundation for the desire to change the appearance of the whole county through self-reliance and accelerated pace. In just one year, there has been such a big change, which shows how important it is to change the guiding ideology of valuing the south and neglecting the north. Grasping both the north and the south, that is, implementing the so-called "two horses harnessed together" and advancing side by side, will not only not slow down the speed as some people imagine, but on the contrary, the speed will be accelerated.
    To improve the production of backward areas, its significance is not only to reduce the burden and eliminate the "burden" for the whole county, but this matter also has a huge promotion effect on the development of advanced areas. Just imagine, a large area of backward areas that has always been neglected has actually made great strides forward, which will be a great encouragement to the people of the whole county! The fact that the Xiaosun Guo Brigade in northern China basically changed its appearance in five years and the fact that the yield per mu of the Xiaoliangqu Brigade reached 400 jin gave a great shock to the southern region: "People with such poor conditions have reached the 'Program' standard. What can we say if we don't reach it!" Recently, a commune in the north challenged the best commune in the south, wanting to conduct a friendly competition with them, which made the party secretary of this commune sleepless all night thinking about how to do a better job in the local area. The situation of mutual promotion and common progress between the north and the south has begun to take shape. The high speed that appears in this situation is the real high speed.
    Correctly treating the problems of various regions in the county is an extremely serious political issue. The fundamental point is to stand on the proletarian position, correctly view and lead the people of the whole county to build socialist mountains and rivers. To eliminate the feudal ideology and bourgeois ideology remaining in the leadership ideology of the county committee, we must also oppose metaphysical views. The so-called "north and south," "fat and lean," "splitting the harness of two horses," etc., are all old ideological manifestations. A revolutionized county committee must revolutionize these ideas, otherwise it will not be possible to comprehensively emphasize politics in the work of leading socialist construction.

### 突出政治，用毛泽东思想调动全县人民革命积极性——记河北固安县委打破重“肥”轻“瘦”的旧思想，加强对落后地区的政治领导

    突出政治，用毛泽东思想调动全县人民革命积极性
    ——记河北固安县委打破重“肥”轻“瘦”的旧思想，加强对落后地区的政治领导
    编者按：县委领导革命化，首先是县委成员思想革命化，这是意识形态领域内的阶级斗争。今天本报发表的《突出政治，用毛泽东思想调动全县人民革命积极性》一文，从一个侧面提出了如何解决县委领导思想革命化的问题。
    一个县的县委会是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导全县人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的司令部。这个司令部的根本任务，是突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，做好人的革命化工作。为了实现这个伟大的任务，县委同志首先要从自己的灵魂深处挖掉一切资产阶级、封建阶级的思想影响。自己革命了，才能领导全县人民闹革命，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍在一切阵地上。
    中共固安县委领导思想中的“重肥轻瘦”、“重南轻北”思想，实际上反映了县委一些同志头脑中的“嫌贫爱富”的旧思想。“嫌穷”、“怕穷”、“看不起穷”，把“穷”看作包袱，这是剥削阶级思想在人们头脑中的反映。固安县委同志们清除了这样的思想，用毛泽东同志教导的阶级分析方法，对北部穷苦落后地区作了阶级分析，对广大社员群众进行了阶级教育，人民革命精神大振。他们开始懂得了毛泽东同志教导的“穷则思变”的伟大真理，做出符合党的社会主义建设总路线精神的工作安排，收到了较大成效。
    各地类似这样的活思想是很多的，我们希望县委同志们在社会主义文化大革命中，勇敢地挖掉领导思想中的旧思想，自觉地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，从经济、政治、思想、文化各个领域内，把社会主义大革命进行到底。
    南北的概念，或是东西的概念，都是一个地理概念。由于地理条件的不同，自然条件也有优劣之分。有的地方南好北差，也有的地方东好西差。一个县的县委，在领导革命化的过程中，怎样打破旧的习惯思想的束缚，眼睛看到好的地方，更看到差的地方，不分南北东西，不分“肥”“瘦”，不心存偏爱，而是突出政治，全面地加强政治领导，这是县委实现领导革命化的一个大问题。
    拿京津保三角地带的固安县来说，千百年来，一条永定河把这个县造成南北不同的局面。北部靠永定河，河水泛滥时，泥沙俱下。沙重泥轻，沙多留在北部，泥多淤在南部，北部多沙贫瘠，南部土壤肥沃。在固安县委的领导思想中，长期以来，有一种南肥北瘦的看法，工作中重南轻北，实际上形成了一条以南养北、南粮北调的方针。
    重南轻北表现在什么地方？
    干部下乡多数去南部，县委主要负责同志和常委没有一个人在北部蹲点。
    生产投资和生产物资百分之八十以上用在南部。
    一九六五年以前全县打了五百多眼机井，百分之九十以上在南部。
    县委开会研究工作，谈生产重点是南部，谈统销粮、救济款重点是北部。
    全县出席省的农业先进单位代表会的两个大队都在南部，在地委上榜的十个先进大队，有九个在南部。
    搞排水工程，在重南轻北的思想指导下，违反了水的自然流向，结果是北部淹了，南部也没有保住。
    公社干部也认为在南部工作才有作为，有前途，由南部调到北部是不光彩的。
    县委领导思想革命化，最根本的是要看是否自觉地用毛泽东思想调动全县全体人民的革命积极性。社会主义社会，阶级斗争遍及每一角落，贫农下中农到处要革命，县委领导人民闹革命，怎能受地区“肥”“瘦”的限制？怎能重“肥”轻“瘦”、“重南轻北”？
    旧的地理概念，早已被革命的现实打破了。永定河，历史上叫无定河。在旧社会，尽管统治阶级把它改名为永定河，但它终归还是一个经常泛滥的“无定河”。解放十六年来，特别是在修了官厅水库之后，永定河真正“永定”了，水害变成了水利。社会主义正在改变自然面貌。但是，人的思想不经过自我革命，就不能正确地认识新的自然现象。他们不了解北部一片被永定河造成的沙地，已经是可以被人民一口一口吃掉的死老虎。沙子，治一块，就会少一块。社会主义的固安县，已经可以不再受永定河的气了。建设固安北部社会主义大经济的自然条件成熟了，但是，为什么北部情况还没有根本改变？北部果真象一些人想的那样不行吗？完全不是。
    北部沙多。这是让人头疼的事。不少人把沙子看作是北部无法战胜的敌人。其实，沙子不过是一种暂时的自然现象，有什么了不起？根据历史记载，这大片的沙地，明朝以前曾经是粮仓。沙是随着永定河的泛滥聚集而成的。社会主义革命和建设就是要解决前人梦想解决而不可能解决的问题。沙地变良田，这才是问题的本质所在。固安县委在思想革命化以后，派人去到北部实际考察的结果，得到了不少对于沙地的新看法。
    原来北部地区的沙子只有一尺多厚，最厚的不过二三尺。沙子下面是肥沃的胶泥土。只要把下面的胶泥土翻上来，泥沙混合，就成了良田。固安县委书记李致和同志说：“大寨人同自然作斗争是碰石头。我们就是要治沙子。改沙子比搬石头要容易的多。可是思想不革命，就看不见，办不到。”
    思想不革命，看南不看北，见物不见人。只看到北部穷，看不到人民要革贫穷的命。革命就能闯出自己的路子来。城关公社是个长期吃供应粮、拿救济款的地方，可是，就在离县城四里的地方，却有一颗北部地区的夜明珠——小孙郭大队。这个大队只有七十户人家，从一九六一年开始挖土垫地，五年来，七百多亩土地已经改造了一半，并且造经济林木七百多亩。果树和经济林去年开始收益。这个队一九六○年只有一匹老马、三只猪；社员每年要吃国家五万斤粮食。一九六五年，粮食总产十九万多斤，社员、集体都有了储备，还卖给国家两万斤；牲畜发展到三十多头，其中骡马十三匹，猪也发展到一百多只。现在他们正利用上千亩沙地培育大片林带。小孙郭大队就是固安北部地区的大寨。县委为什么没有很好地总结经验，广泛传播，把这面旗帜高高树立起来呢？轻北的思想，使他们害了政治上的色盲症。
    看来，落后的不是地理条件，更不是人民群众；落后的是领导，是领导的思想。改造落后，首先要从改造县委的落后思想作起。县委的领导同志中有一些什么观点需要澄清呢？
    “重南轻北”，是因为“南肥北瘦”。怎样看“肥”和“瘦”呢？
    按照社会主义的要求，“肥”的标准首先是政治标准。那里以阶级斗争为纲，执行阶级路线，依靠贫下中农，调动了广大社员群众的革命积极性，那里的社会主义经济就会是大发展。从生产上看大体是两条，一条是粮食产量上“纲要”，超“纲要”。一条是多种经营发展的好，给农业提供资金，让农民增加收入。看来，南部地区的“肥”，是“肥”得不够的。他们着重抓了粮食，没有为扩大再生产而抓多种经营。现在南部一搞农业现代化，需要投入资金，就发现“底气”不足。可是过去所说的“肥”，只不过是反映小农经济思想的“肥”，只是着眼在吃饭问题上，而不是着眼在建设社会主义的大农业上。所以，南“肥”的说法并不全面。只有南部经济全面发展了，才能称得上真正的“肥”。
    怎样看北部的“瘦”呢？前面已经说过，北部的土地经过改造并不比南部差。俗语说：“沙掺粘，赛金团”。社会主义教育运动后，小良渠大队的沙地还没有改造，只是因为推广良种和增加粪肥，去年就达到亩产四百零三斤，上了“纲要”。县委狠狠推广了这个经验，过去认为理应吃国家供应粮的人，再也不“理直气壮”了。流传的“祖宗三代亩产一石”的说法被打破了。产量上“纲要”，在北部是既看得见，也摸得到了。从发展多种经营看，北部条件要比南部优越得多。地多，是最重要的一条。平均每人三亩多地，内有二亩多粮田，一亩林，此外，闲地还很多。沙土地可以种花生、杞柳等。其次，人有从事各种副业如柳编等的专长。在旧社会，这是人们谋生的手段。现在成了提供农业现代化资金的重要条件。
    显然，南“肥”和北“瘦”的看法，是落后于革命形势的，在轻“瘦”重“肥”思想指导下，既不能有按照社会主义标准要求的“肥”，也不能突出政治正确解决“瘦”的问题。不能用旧社会遗留下的“势利眼”去看问题，而要从阶级观点上正确解决南富北贫的问题。只有从党的阶级立场去看，才能不被表面现象所迷惑，把握住矛盾主要方面，发扬人民的一切积极因素，去“瘦”求“肥”，达到社会主义经济全面的发展。
    有人认为：既然是南部条件好，油水多，把重点放在南部有什么错误呢？
    在一定时期，集中人力和物力把南部建设成稳产高产生产基地，把粮食生产尽快抓上去，是对的。几年来，南部的群众，在县委领导下，在粮食生产上，对国家作出了积极的贡献，对北部的阶级兄弟给了有力的支援，这是应该肯定的。但是，作为全县人民战斗司令部的县委，最根本的任务就是突出政治，用毛泽东思想调动全县人民的革命积极性，充分利用全县的物质资源，建设一个社会主义的县。南部粮食上去了，北部就更有条件上去，如果把重点孤立起来，只管重点，不顾其余，这就不对了。以南养北，南部加重了负担，北部感到没有作用和地位，结果南北的积极性都受到了限制，没有充分调动起来。
    北部的干部和群众在三个问题上有意见，一是做了排水工程仍避免不了挨淹，过去下大雨，水能顺当地往南流，这几年，位于上游的北部也要挨淹；二是没有领导他们抓粮食，粮食上不去，什么事情都不主动；三是县委领导跑北部少。他们说，县委只要来这里看一看，就是很大的鼓励。县委认为这些意见是对的，思想革命化后，干部跑北部的多了，对于县委领导的这种改变，群众很满意。群众说：北部地区潜力很大，这个地方不但是个大粮仓，多种经营门路也多。搞好了，一年有五个秋：麦秋、杏秋、柳秋、大秋、梨秋。只要县委领出路子，我们卖点力气，不出三年五年就会变样子。
    有人对重点的了解是有片面性的，他们只抓重点地区，不是重点就不抓。这是放弃领导。思想阵地和生产阵地，社会主义放弃了，资本主义就有了可乘之机。几年来，北部地区几个公社的资本主义自发倾向一度曾有发展，搞副业的方向不对头，少数人沾光，集体和多数社员得利很少。开展了社会主义教育运动，对资本主义自发势力进行了有力的打击。有一位县的领导同志过去长期在南部蹲点，最近转移到北部，看到这里的生产状况，感慨地说：“过去对北部了解太少，北部和南部比，落后了几年。”
    有人认为：南部基础好，发展速度快；北部条件差，一时半晌上不去。因此应该把注意力集中在南边。
    有一种“两马拆套”的说法：二马拉车，一壮一弱，弱马牵扯壮马，影响了车子前进的速度；不如拆套，单马独行。
      “两马合套”还是“两马拆套”？这是要多快好省还是要少慢差费的大问题，是关系到正确执行总路线的大问题。要建设社会主义，要执行总路线，就只能是“两马合套”，并驾齐驱，齐头并进。这样，力量和速度倍增，才是真正的多快好省。
    南部虽说发展快，但只是一个时期的快，而且只是局部的快。局部不等于整体。从整体看，全县一九六五年以前的增产速度，实际上是慢了。十多年来，在“重南轻北”、“以南养北”思想指导下，固安的粮食产量长期保持在八千万斤上下、即所谓“老八千”的水平，未能有较大的增长。一九六五年社会主义教育运动中，这个县的领导初步改变了重南轻北的认识，开始抓了北部，全县粮食总产量就有了显著增长，达到一亿二千五百万斤，比一九六四年增长百分之三十以上。如果没有北部地区的大幅度增产，这样的速度是根本不可能的。
    以北部条件最差的北马村、城关、知子营三个公社为例，这三个公社一九六五年的粮食产量是一千五百八十八万斤，比一九六四年增长百分之八十八。许多长期吃国家供应粮的生产队达到了自给，不少队第一次有了储备粮。“以南养北”的情况开始扭转了。南部北部同时增产，这就为自力更生、加速改变全县面貌的愿望，打下了有力的物质基础。时间仅仅一年，就有了这样大的变化，可见改变重南轻北的指导思想，关系是多么重大。南北一齐抓，即实行所谓“两马合套”，齐头并进的方针，不仅不会象某些人所设想的那样速度会慢，而且恰恰相反，速度是加快了。
    把后进地区生产搞上去，它的意义绝不仅仅是为全县减轻负担、解除“包袱”的问题，这件事对先进地区的发展也具有巨大的促进作用。试想，一大片素来被人忽视的落后地区，居然大踏步前进了，这对全县人民会是多么大的鼓舞的力量！北部小孙郭大队五年基本改变面貌和小良渠大队亩产达到四百斤的事实，给了南部地区很大的震动：“人家条件那样差都上了‘纲要’，我们如果再上不去可怎么说！”最近，北部一个公社向南部最好的一个公社提出挑战，要同他们开展友谊竞赛，使得这个公社的党委书记为考虑如何把本地工作搞得更好而彻夜不眠。南北互相促进、共同前进的局面已经开始形成。这种情况下出现的高速度，才是实实在在的高速度。
    正确对待全县各个不同地区的问题，是一个极其严肃的政治问题。根本之点是站在无产阶级立场，正确看待和领导全县人民建设社会主义河山。要肃清在县委领导思想中残留的封建思想和资产阶级思想，还要反对形而上学观点。所谓“南北”、“肥瘦”、“两马拆套”等问题，都是旧的思想表现。一个革命化的县委，要革这些思想的命，否则就不可能在领导建设社会主义的工作中全面地突出政治。
