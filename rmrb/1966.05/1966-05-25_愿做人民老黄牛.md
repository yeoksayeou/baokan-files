    Willing to be an Old Ox for the People
    Anhui Zongyang Commune Member Zhu Peiling
	Head topped with the blue sky, hands holding a hoe, feet treading through mud, thinking of the whole world;
	Armed with Chairman Mao's thought, I am willing to be an old ox for the people.

    安徽枞阳社员　朱佩玲头顶蓝天手拿锄，脚踩污泥想全球；主席思想武装我，愿做人民老黄牛。
