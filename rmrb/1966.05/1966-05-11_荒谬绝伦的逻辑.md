    Absurd Logic
    By a commentator of this newspaper

    After a series of fascist atrocities in which the Indonesian government organized armed forces and thugs to attack Chinese embassies and consulates, it not only refused to respond to the repeated protests of the Chinese government and showed no remorse, but also made every effort to justify itself and attempted to deny its guilt. Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Malik, in a statement on foreign policy to the Mutual Cooperation Parliament on May 5, said that the anti-China atrocities that occurred in Indonesia were "understandable and logical." The Indonesian government openly regards fascist atrocities that violate the diplomatic privileges of Chinese embassies and consulates as a legitimate means in international relations, which cannot but be surprising.

    Malik has created a peculiar "logic," namely: only the Indonesian reactionaries are allowed to frantically oppose communism, oppose the people, oppose China, and discriminate against Chinese, but Chinese newspapers and radio stations are not allowed to report truthfully. Otherwise, it would be an "attack" and "insult" to Indonesia, which would arouse "strong resentment" and "aversion" among the Indonesian people. Then they have the right to take fascist violent measures against Chinese diplomatic missions, for which the Indonesian government is not responsible.

    Malik's logic is untenable. First of all, there is no such thing as China "attacking" and "insulting" Indonesia. On the contrary, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are attacking China viciously every day. Since the right-wing generals' group launched a counter-revolutionary coup more than seven months ago, Indonesian newspapers and radio stations have published more than 2,000 articles attacking and slandering China. Some leaders of the Indonesian right wing have also openly slandered China as "imperialism" and "neo-colonialism," and so on. Malik's attempt to reverse black and white and make a counter-charge to deny the Indonesian government's guilt is simply impossible.

    Malik's claim that the anti-China fascist atrocities were committed by the Indonesian people is the most clumsy lie. Everyone knows that all these fascist atrocities were committed by only a handful of counter-revolutionary right-wing elements, who cannot represent the Indonesian people at all. The Indonesian people want to be friendly with the people of all countries, and they want to be friendly with the Chinese people. To pin the despicable and dirty acts of burning, killing, and looting by right-wing thugs on the Indonesian people is a great insult to the Indonesian people.

    The facts cannot be denied. All the fascist atrocities of attacking, destroying, and occupying Chinese diplomatic missions were carried out under the direct organization and command of the Indonesian government and with the open cooperation of the Indonesian armed forces. Today's Indonesia is completely under the bloody rule of the right-wing military regime, where those who obey me prosper and those who resist me perish. In Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, in broad daylight, a full-scale performance was staged where thousands of thugs and hundreds of army armed personnel committed violence, looting, and arson against the Chinese embassy. The army even dispatched armored vehicles to break open the gate of the Chinese embassy to clear the way for the fighting thugs. Army armed personnel also shot and wounded the staff of the Chinese embassy. If it were not organized and commanded by the Indonesian government, how could such incidents have occurred? In fact, the heads of the right-wing military group, Suharto, Nasution, and Malik himself, have made "speeches" and "congratulatory messages" to the right-wing thugs, issuing orders and encouragement. Malik's attempt to shirk the Indonesian government's guilt can only be counterproductive.

    The Indonesian right-wing military regime's frantic attack on Chinese embassies and consulates is unprecedented in the history of international relations in terms of the number of times, the scale, and the despicable methods used. In the past seven months, they have attacked Chinese embassies and consulates and other Chinese representative offices in Indonesia more than 20 times, injured more than 40 Chinese diplomats, staff, and reporters, damaged and forcibly occupied most of the office premises and dormitories of Chinese embassies and consulates, and robbed the property and furniture of Chinese diplomatic missions and their personnel. At the same time, they also persecuted overseas Chinese and even massacred hundreds of them. Even Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan did not dare to commit such atrocities against the embassies and consulates of enemy countries, even during wartime. Now, Malik actually claims that this is "logical," which is simply the height of shamelessness. If we act according to this reactionary "logic" of the Indonesian government, then what normal diplomatic relations are there in the world, and what basic principles of international relations are there to speak of?

    In his foreign policy statement, Malik said that China "openly stated that it failed to understand" Indonesia's "developments" and "fundamentally lacked understanding" of the Indonesian situation; that China "attacked" and "insulted" Indonesia. He also once again brought up the Bandung Principles, slandering China for "interfering" in Indonesia's "internal affairs." This is completely unfounded and nonsense.

    Since October 1 last year, what changes have taken place in Indonesia are not only well understood by the Chinese people, but also clearly seen by the people of the world. The words and deeds of the Indonesian right wing themselves illustrate the development of the situation in Indonesia. After the right-wing reactionary forces, with the Indonesian generals' group as the core, launched a counter-revolutionary coup, they implemented white terror in the country, massacring communists and patriotic democratic people, leaving hundreds of thousands of people dead under the counter-revolutionary butcher's knife. In terms of foreign policy, they openly threw themselves into the arms of imperialism. They declared that they would "improve relations with the United States," accept "aid" from US, British imperialism and Japanese militarism, and vigorously carry out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, treating socialist China as an enemy. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces did this themselves, and newspapers and news agencies of various countries also reported it. Why should Chinese newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations conceal the truth for them and put makeup on them? How can the truthful reports of Chinese newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations be "attacks" and "insults" to Indonesia, or "interference" in Indonesia's "internal affairs"? Frankly speaking, what has brought great shame on Indonesia today is none other than a handful of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. Today, it is also a handful of Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces who are wantonly trampling and ravaging the Bandung principles of Asian-African solidarity against imperialism and desecrating the Bandung spirit.

    While wantonly slandering and attacking China, Malik also hypocritically said that the Indonesian government still hopes to "maintain normal and good relations" with China. Mr. Malik, please stop pretending and playing two-faced tricks. In fact, Malik's statement itself is not only a sophistry to cover up anti-China crimes, but also a noteworthy signal to support Indonesian right-wing thugs and continue to instigate new fascist anti-China atrocities. We must solemnly warn the Indonesian government that you can use all your abilities to oppose China! However, no matter what tricks you play, you can never escape the full responsibility for deliberately and completely breaking off relations between China and Indonesia. History will make the most severe judgment on your anti-China crimes.

    荒谬绝伦的逻辑
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚政府在组织武装部队和暴徒袭击中国使领馆的一系列法西斯暴行之后，不但拒不答复中国政府的多次抗议，毫无悔过之意，反而百般辩解，妄图抵赖自己的罪责。印度尼西亚副总理兼外交部长马利克，五月五日在合作国会发表外交政策声明时，说什么印度尼西亚发生的反华暴行，是“可以理解和合乎逻辑的”。印度尼西亚政府公然把侵犯中国使领馆外交特权的法西斯暴行，当作国际关系中的一种正当手段，这不能不令人感到吃惊。
    马利克创造了一种奇特的“逻辑”，那就是：只准印度尼西亚反动派疯狂地反共、反人民和反华排华，不准中国的报纸和广播电台作如实的报道。否则，便是对印度尼西亚进行了“攻击”和“侮辱”，便会引起印度尼西亚人民的“强烈的反感”和“恶感”，于是他们有权对中国的外交代表机构采取法西斯暴力手段，而印度尼西亚政府对此是没有责任的。
    马利克的这种逻辑，是根本站不住脚的。首先，根本不存在中国“攻击”和“侮辱”印度尼西亚的问题，而是印度尼西亚右派反动势力天天在对中国进行恶毒的攻击。自从右派将领集团发动反革命政变后的七个多月以来，印度尼西亚的报纸和电台已经发表了两千多篇攻击和诽谤中国的文章。印度尼西亚右派的一些头目们，也公开诬蔑中国为“帝国主义”和“新殖民主义”等等。马利克想用颠倒黑白、反咬一口的手法，来抵赖印度尼西亚政府的罪责，是根本办不到的。
    马利克把反华法西斯暴行说成是印度尼西亚人民干的，这也是最拙劣不过的撒谎。谁都知道，所有这些法西斯暴行，只是一小撮反革命右派分子干的，他们根本不能代表印度尼西亚人民。印度尼西亚人民是要同各国人民友好的，是要同中国人民友好的。把右派暴徒干的那种烧杀抢劫的卑鄙肮脏的勾当，硬栽在印度尼西亚人民身上，这是对印度尼西亚人民的莫大侮辱。
    事实是不容抵赖的。所有袭击、破坏和霸占中国外交代表机构的法西斯暴行，都是在印度尼西亚政府的直接组织和指挥下，在印度尼西亚武装部队的公开配合下干出来的。今天的印度尼西亚，完全处于右派军人政权的血腥统治之下，顺我者昌，逆我者亡。在印度尼西亚首都雅加达，在光天化日之下，演出了成千暴徒和成百陆军武装人员对中国大使馆行凶、抢劫、放火的全武行。陆军甚至出动了装甲车，撞开中国大使馆的大门，为大打出手的暴徒开道。陆军武装人员还开枪打伤了中国大使馆的工作人员。如果不是印度尼西亚政府组织和指挥的，怎么可能发生这类事件呢？事实上，右派军人集团的头目苏哈托、纳苏蒂安和马利克本人，都曾对右派暴徒发表“谈话”、“贺词”，发出命令，进行鼓励。马利克企图推卸印度尼西亚政府的罪责，只能是欲盖弥彰。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权疯狂袭击中国使领馆的野蛮暴行，其次数之多，规模之大，手段之卑劣，是国际关系史上闻所未闻、见所未见的。七个多月来，他们袭击中国使领馆等中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构达二十多次，打伤中国外交官员、工作人员和记者等四十多人，破坏和强占了中国使领馆的绝大部分办公处所和宿舍，抢劫了中国外交代表机构及其人员的财物和家具。同时，他们还大肆迫害华侨，甚至屠杀了华侨数百人。过去的希特勒德国和军国主义的日本，即使在战争时期，对待敌国的使领馆也不敢干出这样的暴行。而现在，马利克居然声称这是“合乎逻辑”的，这简直是无耻之尤。如果按照印度尼西亚政府的这种反动“逻辑”办事，那么，世界上还有什么正常的外交关系，还有什么起码的国际关系准则可言呢？
    马利克在外交政策声明中，说什么中国“公然表明它未能了解”印度尼西亚的“事态发展”，对印度尼西亚局势“根本缺乏了解”；说什么中国“攻击”和“侮辱”了印度尼西亚。他并且又一次搬出万隆原则，诬蔑中国“干涉”印度尼西亚“内政”。这完全是信口开河，胡说八道。
    自去年十月一日以来，印度尼西亚发生了什么变化，不但中国人民很了解，全世界人民也看得很清楚。印度尼西亚右派自己的言行，就说明了印度尼西亚的事态发展。以印度尼西亚将领集团为核心的右派反动势力发动反革命政变后，在国内实行白色恐怖，大肆屠杀共产党人和爱国民主人士，使数十万人死于反革命的屠刀之下。在对外政策方面，他们公开投入了帝国主义的怀抱。他们声言要“改善同美国的关系”，接受美、英帝国主义和日本军国主义的“援助”，并且大肆进行反华排华，把社会主义的中国当作敌人。印度尼西亚右派反动势力自己这么干了，各国的报纸和通讯社也这么报道了，为什么中国的报纸通讯社和电台反而要为他们隐瞒真相，替他们涂脂抹粉呢？中国的报纸通讯社和电台如实地作了报道，怎么就是“攻击”和“侮辱”印度尼西亚，怎么就是“干涉”印度尼西亚的“内政”呢？老实说，今天使印度尼西亚蒙受奇耻大辱的，不是别人，正是一小撮印度尼西亚的右派反动势力。今天恣意践踏和蹂躏亚非团结反帝的万隆原则、亵渎万隆精神的，也不是别人，正是一小撮印度尼西亚的右派反动势力。
    马利克在大肆诬蔑和攻击中国的同时，还假惺惺地说什么印度尼西亚政府仍然希望同中国“保持正常的良好关系”。马利克先生，请不要再装模作样，玩弄两面手法了。实际上，马利克的声明本身，不仅是一份掩饰反华罪行的狡辩辞，而且也是为印度尼西亚右派暴徒张目，继续策动新的法西斯反华暴行的一个值得注意的信号。我们必须正告印度尼西亚政府，你们有多大的能耐进行反华，就请你们使出浑身解数来吧！但是，不管你们耍什么花样，你们绝对逃脱不了蓄意彻底破裂中国和印度尼西亚两国关系的全部罪责。历史必将对你们的反华罪行作出最严厉的判决。
