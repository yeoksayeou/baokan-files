    Another Sinister Step in Serving as an Accomplice to U.S. Aggression Against Vietnam and Indochina
    Thailand Brazenly Announces Dispatch of Naval and Air Forces to Participate in the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    "Voice of the People of Thailand" Radio Warns that the Thanom Group Will Inevitably Be Punished
    Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, Bangkok Dispatch: Ignoring national interests, the Thai Thanom reactionary ruling clique brazenly announced on the 3rd its decision to dispatch naval and air forces to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for the U.S. imperialists in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    According to official Thai announcements, this decision was made at a cabinet meeting presided over by Thanom. The combat forces prepared for dispatch include: one tank landing ship and one coastal patrol boat. Both of these ships were "donated" by the United States and have a total of 189 Thai officers and soldiers. In addition, they are preparing to dispatch two C-123 transport aircraft "aided" by the United States, flown by Thai pilots. These cannon fodder troops will arrive in South Vietnam within two months.
    It is reported that the Thai government has allocated 2.5 million baht (20.80 baht equals one U.S. dollar) as maintenance expenses for these troops going to Vietnam this year. Starting next year, 10.5 million baht will be allocated annually as maintenance expenses.
    Thailand has long become a military base for U.S. aggression against South Vietnam and the entire Indochina. A report submitted by the Thai Ministry of Defense to the cabinet meeting also admitted that as early as 1964, Thailand had sent transport aircraft pilots and maintenance personnel to South Vietnam to serve the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, and had trained seven batches of jet pilots for the South Vietnamese puppet clique.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, Bangkok Dispatch: The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station published an editorial on the 4th, calling on the Thai people to wage a resolute struggle against the Thanom traitorous clique's dispatch of troops to South Vietnam to serve as accomplices to the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The editorial said that the Thanom traitorous clique's decision to send naval and air forces to South Vietnam to serve the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam is a serious event, indicating that the Thanom group has directly participated in the war of aggression against Vietnam and openly declared itself an enemy of the Vietnamese people. This completely violates the will of the thirty million Thai people; this is a barbaric trampling on the Geneva Accords and principles of international law; this is a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world.
    The editorial pointed out that the Thanom traitorous clique has always provided the U.S. imperialists with bases for the war of aggression against Vietnam, and has helped and supported the U.S. aggression against Vietnam in various ways. Now it openly sends troops, warships, and aircraft to South Vietnam to slaughter the Vietnamese people together with the U.S. imperialists, acting as accomplices to the U.S. aggression against Vietnam. This is another serious step in its service to the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to expand the Indochina war. This sinful behavior will bring even deeper disasters to the Thai people.
    The editorial warned that if the Thanom group disregards the opposition of the Thai people and the people of the world and insists on following the U.S. imperialists' path of participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam, it will inevitably be punished by the Thai people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of the world.
    The editorial said that no matter how the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices struggle, they will certainly not be able to save their doomed fate. The Thanom group's direct participation in the war of aggression against Vietnam will eventually be burned to ashes together with the U.S. imperialists and other accomplices.

    充当美帝侵略越南和印度支那帮凶的又一罪恶步骤
    泰国悍然宣布派海空部队参与侵越战争
    “泰国人民之声”电台警告说他侬集团必遭惩罚
    新华社五日讯　曼谷消息：泰国他侬反动统治集团不顾民族利益，三日悍然宣布决定派遣海空部队到南越，为美帝国主义扩大侵越战争充当炮灰。
    据泰国官方公布，这项决定是由他侬主持的内阁会议作出的。准备派遣的战斗部队包括：一艘坦克登陆舰和一艘海岸巡逻艇。这两艘舰艇都是美国“赠送”的，共拥有泰国官兵一百八十九人。另外还准备派遣两架由泰国驾驶员驾驶的美国“援助”的C—123型运输机。这些炮灰部队将在两个月内到达南越。
    据报道，泰国政府已经拨出二百五十万铢（二○点八○铢合一美元）作为今年这些赴越南部队的维持费。从明年起，每年将拨出一千零五十万铢作为维持费。
    泰国早已成为美国侵略南越和整个印度支那的军事基地。泰国国防部向内阁会议提出的报告还承认，早在一九六四年，泰国就曾经派出运输机的飞行员和维修人员到南越为美国侵越战争效劳，并为南越傀儡集团训练了七批喷气式飞机驾驶员。
    据新华社五日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台四日发表社论，号召泰国人民进行坚决的斗争，反对他侬卖国集团出兵南越，充当美帝国主义侵略越南战争的帮凶。
    社论说，他侬卖国集团决定派海空军去南越为美国侵略越南战争效劳，这是一个严重的事件，表明他侬集团已直接参加侵越战争，公开宣布与越南人民为敌。这是完全违背三千万泰国人民的意志；这是对日内瓦协议和国际法原则的野蛮践踏；这是对全世界爱好和平人民的挑衅。
    社论指出，他侬卖国集团过去一直为美帝国主义提供侵越战争的基地，并从各方面帮助和支持美国侵略越南。现在它又公开派遣军队、战舰和飞机去南越，跟美帝国主义一起屠杀越南人民，作美帝侵略越南的帮凶。这是它为美帝国主义扩大印度支那战争阴谋效劳的又一个严重步骤。这种罪恶的行为将给泰国人民带来更深重的灾难。
    社论警告说，他侬集团如果不顾泰国人民和世界人民的反对，硬要在追随美帝国主义参加侵越战争的道路上走下去，必将遭到泰国人民、越南人民和世界人民的惩罚。
    社论说，不管美帝国主义及其帮凶怎样挣扎，肯定不能挽救它们注定失败的命运。他侬集团直接参加侵越战争，终将同美帝国主义和其他帮凶一起被烈火烧成灰烬。
