    Last year, Japanese youth who came to China to participate in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally visited the Peasant Movement Training Institute in Guangzhou, which was founded by Comrade Mao Zedong in his early years. Looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao, they listened attentively to the guide's explanation of the Chinese people's arduous struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao, which finally led to the victory of the revolution.

    去年来中国参加中日青年友好大联欢的日本青年，在广州参观毛泽东同志早年主办的农民运动讲习所。他们望着毛主席的像，专心地听讲解员讲述中国人民在毛主席的领导下，经过艰苦的斗争，最后终于取得胜利的革命历程。　新华社记者　张家昌摄
