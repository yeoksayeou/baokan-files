    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, the Fifth Session of the Third Supreme People's Assembly of Korea was held in Pyongyang from April 27 to 29.

    The meeting heard a report by Finance Minister Han Sang-du on the 1965 State Budget Final Accounts and the 1966 State Budget, and adopted a resolution approving the results of the 1965 State Budget execution and the 1966 State Budget Law.

    In his report, Finance Minister Han Sang-du said that great achievements had been made last year in implementing the national economic plan and strengthening national defense.

    He also said that in response to the blatant aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism and its followers, it was necessary to strengthen national defense with more force than planned. Therefore, we were unable to execute the state budget according to plan, but both state revenue and expenditure increased compared to 1964. Last year, the state's revenue totaled 3,573,840,000 won. These funds, in addition to being used to promote socialist construction, strengthen national defense, and improve the people's welfare, also had a surplus of 97,710,000 won.

    Han Sang-du said that the most important issue for us today is to effectively utilize the existing economic foundation, manage all aspects of life diligently and frugally to promote socialist construction, continue to strengthen national defense, and at the same time further improve the people's living standards.

    He pointed out that both the state's revenue and expenditure in 1966 would be 3,752,760,000 won, and the state's revenue would increase by 5 percent compared to 1965.

    He said that in order to victoriously complete this year's combat tasks, we must more resolutely implement the Party's policy of advancing economic construction and defense construction in parallel, arming the whole people and fortifying the entire country, must prevent complacency and relaxation, oppose the atmosphere of peace, and make full preparations to staunchly defend the motherland and the revolution from enemy aggression.

    After hearing the report by Vice-Premier of the Cabinet Kim Kwang-hyup on the complete abolition of the agricultural tax in kind system, the meeting adopted a law on this issue, deciding to completely abolish the agricultural tax in kind system this year.

    The meeting passed a letter supporting the statement of the Third Session of the Third National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The letter adopted at the meeting said: The Third Session of the National Assembly of Vietnam strongly condemned US imperialism for gradually escalating the war of aggression against South Vietnam and the destructive war against North Vietnam, exposed the "peace talks" scam of US imperialism, and called for a more resolute struggle until final victory, which is completely correct.

    The Korean Supreme People's Assembly severely condemns the new conspiracies of US imperialism to expand the war, and firmly supports the firm stand of the Vietnamese people expressed in the statement of the Vietnamese National Assembly.

    The letter warned that if the US imperialists do not abandon their conspiracy to expand the war, they will surely suffer a more shameful defeat in the face of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary forces of the world.

    The letter exposed the cunning tricks of US imperialism in attempting to cover up its conspiracy to expand the war with a new smokescreen of "peace discussions."

    The letter emphasized that the Korean people will always fight alongside the Vietnamese people under any difficult conditions until the fraternal Vietnamese people completely drive out the US imperialist aggressors.

    The meeting adopted a letter to the South Korean people, calling on the South Korean people to wage a resolute struggle against the Park Chung-hee clique for sending troops to South Vietnam to participate in the US war of aggression.

    The letter to the South Korean people said that all the people in the northern half of Korea will give all possible support to the struggle of the South Korean people, and together with them, will resolutely fight for the complete liberation and independence of the motherland.

    The meeting also approved some decrees promulgated by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly.

    Premier of the Korean Cabinet Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Choi Yong-kun, and other Korean party and government leaders attended the meeting.

    朝鲜最高人民会议举行第五次会议
    韩相斗财政相强调要促进经济建设，加强国防，提高人民生活会议重申支持越南人民斗争并号召南朝鲜人民反对侵越战争
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜第三届最高人民会议第五次会议四月二十七日到二十九日在平壤举行。
    会议听取了财政相韩相斗关于一九六五年国家决算和一九六六年国家预算的报告，并且通过了批准一九六五年国家预算执行结果的决议和一九六六年国家预算法。
    财政相韩相斗在报告中说，去年在执行国民经济计划方面，在加强国防方面，都取得了巨大成就。
    他又说，针对美帝国主义及其追随者露骨的侵略阴谋，不得不超出国家计划以更多的力量来加强国防。因此，我们没有能按计划执行国家预算，但是国家的收入和支出都比一九六四年有所增加。去年国家的收入共达三十五亿七千三百八十四万元。这些资金除被利用来促进社会主义建设、加强国防、增进人民福利外，还剩余九千七百七十一万元。
    韩相斗说，今天我们最重要的问题，是有效利用现有的经济基础、勤俭地管好各方面的生活来促进社会主义建设，继续加强国防，同时还要进一步提高人民的生活。
    他指出一九六六年国家的收入和支出都将为三十七亿五千二百七十六万元，国家收入将比一九六五年增长百分之五。
    他说，为胜利完成今年的战斗任务，我们必须更加坚决贯彻党关于经济建设和国防建设并进、全民武装和全国堡垒化的方针，必须防止安逸和松懈，反对和平气氛，作好充分准备，以便坚强地保卫祖国和革命不受敌人的侵犯。
    会议在听取了内阁副首相金光侠所作的关于完全废除农业实物税制度的报告后，通过了有关这个问题的法律，决定在今年全部废除农业实物税制度。
    会议通过了一封信，支持越南民主共和国第三届国会第三次会议的声明。会议通过的信件说：越南国会第三次会议强烈谴责美帝国主义逐步加剧侵略越南南方的战争和对越南北方的破坏性战争，揭露了美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局并号召更坚定地进行斗争直到取得最后胜利，这是完全正确的。
    朝鲜最高人民会议严厉谴责美帝国主义扩大战争的新阴谋，并且坚决支持越南国会声明所表达的越南人民的坚定立场。
    信件警告说，如果美帝国主义者不放弃扩大战争的阴谋，他们在越南人民和世界革命力量面前一定要遭到更可耻的失败。
    信件揭露了美帝国主义企图以新的“和平讨论”的烟幕来掩盖它扩大战争的阴谋的狡猾诡计。
    信件强调说，朝鲜人民在任何困难条件下将始终同越南人民一起战斗，直到兄弟的越南人民完全赶走美帝国主义侵略者为止。
    会议通过了告南朝鲜人民书，号召南朝鲜人民为反对朴正熙集团向南越派遣军队参加美国侵略战争而进行坚决斗争。
    告南朝鲜人民书说，朝鲜北半部全体人民将给予南朝鲜人民的斗争以一切可能的支持，并且同他们一起，为祖国的彻底解放和独立而坚决斗争。
    会议还批准了最高人民会议常任委员会颁布的一些法令。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成、最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健和朝鲜其他党政领导人出席了会议。
