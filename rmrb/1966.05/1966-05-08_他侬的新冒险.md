    Thanom's authorities have brazenly decided to send naval and air forces to South Vietnam to directly participate in the US war of aggression against Vietnam. This is a new adventurous act by the Thai reactionaries in openly acting as accomplices of US imperialism.
    The Thai reactionaries have long not only turned Thai territory into a military base for the United States to invade Vietnam and Indochina, but also provided various military assistance to the South Vietnamese puppet clique. Thailand has also been involved in the US imperialism's continuous expansion of the war of aggression against Laos. As for the invasion and provocation of Cambodia by Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppets under the command of US imperialism, they are undisguised collusions. Now the United States is further driving Thailand to directly send troops to South Vietnam. This, in addition to illustrating that US imperialism is at the end of its rope and urgently needs to drag a few more lackeys onto the stage to help, clearly indicates that US imperialism is preparing to use Thailand as an important base and accomplice to expand the war of aggression in Indochina.
    What will be the result of the Thai reactionaries sending troops to South Vietnam? More than 200,000 American aggressor troops, plus the accomplice troops of South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, have all proven unable to save the situation, and are suffering increasingly larger defeats. So, what can the Thai reactionaries do to prop up their American masters? As for the Thai reactionaries, because they have followed the US imperialist policy of aggression, their situation is already very unfavorable. The patriotic armed struggle of the Thai people is flourishing and unstoppable. Now that the Thai reactionaries are further plunging themselves into the quagmire of the US war of aggression against Vietnam, they can only put themselves in a situation where they are beaten on both sides.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Lackeys who are wholeheartedly led by the nose by US imperialism will only be buried with US imperialism in the end." The fate of the like of Ngo Dinh Diem and Syngman Rhee is such. It seems that Thanom is following in their footsteps and heading towards the same end.

    他侬的新冒险
    泰国当局悍然决定派出海空军前往南越，直接参加美国侵越战争，这是泰国反动派公开充当美帝国主义帮凶的新的冒险行径。
    泰国反动派早就不仅把泰国领土变成美国侵略越南和印度支那的军事基地，而且向南越傀儡集团提供各种军事援助。在美帝国主义不断扩大侵略老挝的战争中，泰国也是插了手的。至于泰国和南越傀儡在美帝国主义指挥下，对柬埔寨的侵犯和挑衅，更是毫不遮掩的勾当。现在美国进一步驱使泰国直接出兵南越，这除了说明美帝国主义日暮途穷，急需多拉个把走狗出场助阵以外，显然表明美帝国主义正在准备以泰国为重要基地和帮凶，来扩大在印度支那的侵略战火。
    泰国反动派出兵南越，会有什么结果呢？二十多万美国侵略军，加上南朝鲜、澳大利亚和新西兰的帮凶军，都已证明无法挽救败局，而且吃的败仗越来越大，那么，泰国反动派又能给美国主子撑得了什么场面呢！至于对泰国反动派来说，由于它们追随美帝国主义侵略政策，景况已经十分不妙，泰国人民爱国武装斗争正在蓬勃兴起，势不可挡。现在泰国反动派进一步使自己陷入美国侵越战争泥潭之中，只能使自己处于两头挨打的境地。
    毛泽东同志说过：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”吴庭艳、李承晚之流的下场，都是如此。看来，他侬正在步他们的后尘，向着同样的结局走去。
