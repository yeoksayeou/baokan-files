    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 1st. Representatives from all walks of life in Hanoi held a rally at Ba Dinh Hall on the evening of April 30th to warmly celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day.

    Vietnamese Party and government leaders Le Duan, Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Le Duc Tho, Le Thanh Nghi, Hoang Van Hoan, Phan Ke Toai and others attended the celebration.

    Truong Chinh, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Vietnamese National Assembly, delivered the opening speech. He said that "May Day" International Labor Day is a day for the working people of the world to strengthen their unity and fight against U.S. imperialism and old and new colonialism. At the same time, this year's International Labor Day comes at a time when the military and civilians of North Vietnam have shot down 1,000 U.S. bandit aircraft, and the military and civilians of South Vietnam have crushed the "dry season offensive" of the United States and its lackeys. He called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to launch a patriotic emulation movement and strive to defend the North, liberate the South, and unify the motherland.

    Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that in the past year or so, the people and army of North Vietnam have achieved brilliant victories in both production and combat. The U.S. imperialist offensive against North Vietnam has not only failed to shake the fighting will of the Vietnamese military and civilians, but has instead promoted their revolutionary heroism. He said, "Our people are not afraid of sacrifice or hardship, and are determined to be ready to fight at any time, and can also fight for five, ten, twenty years, or even longer, until final victory."

    The meeting finally passed a resolution condemning the aggressive crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people and expressing the determination of the Vietnamese people to fight to the end.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 1st. The working people of all circles in Pyongyang, the capital of Korea, warmly celebrated "May Day" International Labor Day.

    Korean Premier Kim Il Sung and other party and government leaders, including Choi Yong Kun, Kim Il, Park Kum Chul, and Kim Kwang Hyup, visited the Kang Kon Military Academy on May 1st, watched the students' group exercises "Twenty Years in the Embrace of the Party," and also watched their live ammunition shooting exercises.

    越朝两国党和国家领导人同人民群众一道欢度节日
    新华社河内一日电　河内市各界代表四月三十日晚上在巴亭会堂举行集会，热烈庆祝“五一”国际劳动节。
    越南党政领导人黎笋、长征、范文同、武元甲、黎德寿、黎清毅、黄文欢、潘继遂等出席了庆祝会。
    越南国会常务委员会主席长征致开幕词。他说，“五一”国际劳动节是全世界劳动人民加强团结，反对美帝国主义，反对新老殖民主义斗争的日子。同时今年的国际劳动节，又是在越南北方军民击落一千架美国强盗飞机，越南南方军民粉碎了美国及其走狗的“旱季攻势”的时候到来的。他号召越南北方军民展开爱国竞赛运动，为保卫北方、解放南方，统一祖国而奋斗。
    越南总工会主席黄国越在会上作了报告。他说，一年多来，越南北方全民全军在生产和战斗两个方面，都取得了辉煌胜利。美帝国主义进攻越南北方，不仅不能动摇越南军民的战斗意志，反而使军民们的革命英雄主义得到了发扬。他说，“我国人民不怕牺牲，不怕艰苦，下定决心随时准备战斗，同时也能够再战斗五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，直到最后胜利。”
    集会最后通过了一项决议，谴责美帝国主义对越南人民犯下的侵略罪行和表示越南人民战斗到底的决心。
