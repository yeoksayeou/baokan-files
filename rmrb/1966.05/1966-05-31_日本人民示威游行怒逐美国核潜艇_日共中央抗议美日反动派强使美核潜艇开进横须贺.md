    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th: Fifteen hundred Japanese workers, students, and citizens braved the heavy rain on the morning of May 30th to hold a protest rally at the seaside park in front of the US base in Yokosuka City, protesting against the US nuclear submarine "Halibut" intruding into Yokosuka Port on the morning of May 30th. This is the ninth time a US nuclear submarine has entered a Japanese port since 1964.

    Japanese Communist Party Senator Masao Iwama spoke at the rally, condemning US imperialism for trampling its dirty feet on the doorstep of Tokyo, the heart of Japan. He also condemned the Sato cabinet for agreeing to the US sending the nuclear submarine "Halibut" to Yokosuka.

    Koabayashi Toru, representative of the Central Executive Committee for Abolishing the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and Striving for Various Demands, spoke at the meeting, calling on all democratic forces in Japan to rise up and conduct a nationwide struggle.

    After the meeting, the masses, holding up placards, began a demonstration, shouting slogans such as "Halibut go home!" "US troops get out of Vietnam!" The demonstrators passed through the gate of the US naval base and entered the city, where citizens welcomed them and shouted in unison: "Nuclear submarines go home!"

    In order to suppress the protests of the Japanese people and the people of Yokosuka, the Sato government mobilized 5,600 policemen to Yokosuka. The Maritime Safety Agency ordered a ban on commercial tour boats from operating in Yokosuka Port in order to prevent the people of Yokosuka from holding protest demonstrations in the port. On the evening of May 29th, approximately 8,200 people held a rally and demonstration in the downtown area of Yokosuka City.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 29th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party handed over a letter of protest to the US Embassy in Japan on May 29th, condemning the US government for sending the nuclear submarine "Halibut" to intrude into Yokosuka on May 30th. The letter of protest emphasized that this atrocity by the US government "is a serious challenge to the Japanese people who are striving for independence and peace."

    The letter of protest pointed out that the US government, ignoring the strong opposition of the Japanese people, brazenly wants to have its nuclear submarine enter Yokosuka, which is very close to the Japanese capital Tokyo, with the aim of paving the way for the large-scale stationing of US nuclear fleets, including the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise," in Japanese ports. The letter of protest demanded that the United States immediately cancel its plan to station nuclear submarines in Japanese ports. The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party also submitted a letter of protest to the Sato government on May 29th. (Attached photo)

    日本人民示威游行怒逐美国核潜艇
    日共中央抗议美日反动派强使美核潜艇开进横须贺
    据新华社三十日讯　东京消息：一千五百名日本工人、学生和市民三十日上午冒着倾盆大雨，在横须贺市美国基地前的海滨公园举行抗议大会，抗议美国核潜艇“军曹鱼号”在三十日上午闯进横须贺港。这是一九六四年以来美国核潜艇第九次开入日本港口。
    日本共产党参议员岩间正男在大会上讲话，他谴责美帝国主义把它的脏脚踏上作为日本心脏的东京的前门口。他同时谴责佐藤内阁同意美国派核潜艇“军曹鱼号”开进横须贺。
    废除日美“安全条约”争取实现各种要求中央执行委员会代表小林彻在会上讲话，号召日本所有的民主力量起来进行全国范围的斗争。
    大会结束后，高举标语牌的群众开始了示威游行，高呼“军曹鱼号滚回去”“美国军队滚出越南”等口号。游行者经过美国海军基地的大门，进入市区，市民们欢迎他们，同声高呼：“核潜艇滚回去”。
    为了镇压日本人民和横须贺人民的抗议活动，佐藤政府调集了五千六百名警察到横须贺。海上保安厅下令禁止商业性的游览船只在横须贺港内行驶，以阻挠横须贺人民在港内举行抗议示威。在二十九日晚上，大约有八千二百人曾在横须贺市的闹市举行大会和游行。
    据新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会二十九日把一份抗议书交给美国驻日本大使馆，谴责美国政府将于三十日派“军曹鱼号”核潜艇闯入横须贺。抗议书强调指出，美国政府的这一暴行，“是对争取独立与和平的日本人民的严重挑战”。
    抗议书指出，美国政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对，悍然要使它的核潜艇闯进离日本首都东京很近的横须贺，目的是为包括核动力航空母舰“企业号”在内的美国核舰队大规模地进驻日本港口铺平道路。抗议书要求美国立即撤销核潜艇进驻日本港口的计划。日本共产党中央委员会二十九日还向佐藤政府递交了抗议书。（附图片）
