    Facts Shatter Counter-Revolutionary Lies
    The Dictatorship of the Proletariat is Ironclad; Deng Tuo's Cry for the Party to "Step Down" is a Delusion!
    Nanchang
    Nanchang City's Five-Good Workers held a symposium to criticize Deng Tuo and his gang of black bandits for their crimes against the Party and socialism. The Five-Good Workers who participated in the symposium angrily refuted Deng Tuo's sinister language that viciously attacked the Party and its leadership. Wang Jinsheng, a worker-engineer at Hongdu Machinery Factory, said that in the old society, I was a poor child. After liberation, the Party cultivated me into an engineer, enabling thousands of workers to stand up and become masters. Who says the Party "looks down on the masses"!
    Deng Tuo smeared the Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "talking big," and everyone pointed out that this was complete nonsense. Yu Shuigen, a worker at the Jiangxi Tractor Factory, said that before liberation, the Jiangxi Tractor Factory was a small factory with only a few dilapidated machines. During the Great Leap Forward, workers, in accordance with the Party's call for self-reliance and hard work, manufactured amphibious tractors. These ironclad facts shattered Deng Tuo's lies that our Party was "bragging."
    The Five-Good Workers vehemently denounced Deng Tuo's sinister language accusing the Party of "not cherishing the working people" and "not cherishing manpower." Peng Xianji, a worker at the Jiangxi Tractor Factory, said with irrepressible anger: In the old society, I was an orphan. I herded sheep for the landlord at the age of seven and was often beaten and starved. At the age of twelve, I entered the factory as an apprentice. The boss forced me to work and hit me on the head with an iron rod. Once I was so sick that I was unconscious, and they wanted to throw me into the wilderness to feed the dogs. Is there any indication that the reactionary ruling class in the old society cherished labor power! Peng Xianji also said that during the Great Leap Forward, he did work hard and practically, but that was to build socialism and give play to the spirit of workers as masters of their own affairs. And the Party's care for the workers is the most meticulous. When he got sick, the branch secretary and the factory director often came to visit him and sent him to Lushan for treatment. The Five-Good Workers unanimously pointed out that Deng Tuo's attempts to undermine the Party's fish-and-water relationship with the workers and peasants would not succeed.
    At the meeting, the Five-Good Workers also solemnly warned Deng Tuo and other anti-Party elements: The Party's leadership and the dictatorship of the proletariat are ironclad; anyone who shouts for the Party to "step down" is delusional.

    事实粉碎了反革命谎言
    无产阶级专政是铁打的，邓拓叫喊要党“下台”是妄想！
    南昌
    南昌市五好工人举行座谈会，批判邓拓等一伙黑帮分子反党反社会主义的罪行。参加座谈的五好工人愤怒驳斥邓拓恶毒地攻击党和党的领导的黑话。洪都机械厂工人工程师王金生说，在旧社会，我是个穷孩子，解放后党把我培养成工程师，使千千万万的工人翻身作了主人，谁说党“看不起群众”！
    邓拓污蔑大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，大家指出这全是胡说。江西拖拉机厂工人喻水根说，江西拖拉机厂解放前是个只有几台烂机器的小工厂，在大跃进中，工人根据党提出自力更生，奋发图强的号召，制造出了水旱两用拖拉机。这铁一般的事实粉碎了邓拓骂我们党“吹牛皮”的谎话。
    五好工人们对邓拓指骂党“不爱护劳动人民”，“不爱惜民力”的黑话，进行了痛斥。江西拖拉机厂工人彭先吉怒不可遏地说：在旧社会我是个孤儿，七岁给地主放羊，经常挨打受饿。十二岁进工厂当学徒，老板强逼我劳动，用铁棍打我头，有次我病得不省人事，他们想把我抛到野外去喂狗。有那一点能说明旧社会反动统治阶级是爱护劳动力的！彭先吉又说，在大跃进中他的确苦干实干过，但那是为了建设社会主义，发挥工人当家作主人的精神。而党对工人的关怀，却是最无微不至的。他生了病，支部书记、厂长常来探望，并送他到庐山去疗养。五好工人们一致指出，邓拓破坏党与工人农民鱼水般的关系，这是办不到的。
    会上，五好工人还严正警告邓拓等反党分子：党的领导，无产阶级专政是铁打的，任何人叫喊要党“下台”，都是妄想。
