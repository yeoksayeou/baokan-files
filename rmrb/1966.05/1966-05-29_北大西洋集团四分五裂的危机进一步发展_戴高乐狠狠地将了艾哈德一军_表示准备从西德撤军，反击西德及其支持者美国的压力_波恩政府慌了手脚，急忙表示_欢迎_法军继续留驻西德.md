    Crisis of the North Atlantic Group Splitting Further Develops
    De Gaulle Checkmates Erhard Severely
    Expresses Readiness to Withdraw Troops from West Germany, Counterattacking the Pressure from West Germany and its Supporter, the United States
    Bonn Government Panics, Hastily Expressing "Welcome" for French Troops to Continue Stationing in West Germany
    Xinhua News Agency, Bonn Electric Dispatch: A note from the French government to the West German government was announced here on the 22nd. This note shows that the West German government's practice of cooperating with the United States to exert pressure on France on the issue of the North Atlantic Group has been fiercely countered by the de Gaulle government. This situation reflects the further development of the crisis in the North Atlantic Group.
    The note, which France handed to West Germany on the 18th, clarified the French government's position on the issue of whether French troops should remain stationed in West Germany after France's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group Command on July 1st this year. Since France announced its withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group's military "integration" mechanism, the Bonn government, which has been using the banner of this group to cover up the revival of West German militarism, has been trying its best to maintain this military group, which is on the verge of collapse, while also wanting to take advantage of France's withdrawal to raise West Germany's status. Therefore, under the support of the United States, it exerted pressure on France. To this end, the Bonn government gave France a note on May 3rd, proposing a series of conditions for the French troops to remain stationed in West Germany, actually trying to trap France back into the circle of North Atlantic military "integration" and to subject the French troops to a certain degree of West German jurisdiction. However, West Germany also relies on France. It fears that a fallout with France will greatly weaken its position in bargaining with the United States, especially that France will no longer support West Germany on the German question. Therefore, while proposing the above note, the leaders of the Bonn government also said that West Germany still "welcomes" the French troops to remain stationed.
    Grasping this weakness of West Germany, France, in its note of the 18th, asked West Germany to clearly state whether it wanted French troops to remain stationed or not. It said that France did not want to keep troops in West Germany and was prepared to withdraw troops from July 1966 and complete the withdrawal by July 1967 if West Germany did not want French troops to remain stationed.
    The French note stated that only on the premise that West Germany welcomes the French troops to remain stationed would France be willing to negotiate with West Germany on the actual conditions for the French troops to be stationed in West Germany. In this regard, France refuted West Germany's statement that after France withdrew from the North Atlantic Group's military "integration" mechanism, it could not enjoy the rights conferred by the 1954 agreement on the stationing of Western Allied forces in West Germany. The note emphasized that a slight modification of the 1954 agreement could serve as an "appropriate legal basis" for negotiations.
    France also particularly seized on West Germany's fundamental weakness in that it could not lack France's support on the German question, giving West Germany a heavy blow. It reminded West Germany that while France enjoys the "right" to station troops in West Germany under the 1954 agreement, it also undertakes the "obligation" in the "reunification" of Germany. It warned in the note that whoever doubts France's right to station troops is damaging the "responsibility" of the four countries, including France, for the "reunification" of Germany.
    When talking about the future relationship between the French troops stationed in West Germany and the troops of other countries of the North Atlantic Group stationed in West Germany, France only reiterated its attitude towards the relationship between the French troops and the "integrated" troops of this group after its withdrawal from the military "integration" mechanism.
    It said in the note that France is willing to negotiate on the issue of "cooperation" between each other in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This article stipulates that when one of the signatory countries of the treaty is attacked, other signatory countries should provide the assistance they deem necessary.
    After the French note was published, the Western press pointed out that the tone of the note was "tough" and that it showed that France forced West Germany to make a "either/or choice."
    The de Gaulle government's response of "toughness" with "toughness," especially the throwing out of the trump card of the German "reunification" issue, panicked the West German government. West German Foreign Minister Schroeder hurriedly came out on the 22nd to say that the West German government "welcomes" the French troops to continue to stay in West Germany. Leaders of various parties in Bonn also expressed their desire to negotiate with France.
    West Germany's pressure on France with the United States as its backstage support not only failed to gain any practical benefits, but also caused the Erhard government, whose position was originally unstable, to be severely attacked again from within its own party. The faction headed by former Chancellor Adenauer and Christian Social Union Chairman and former Defense Minister Strauss criticized West Germany's note to France as "too cold" and "unnecessarily tough," demanding that "everything possible be done to maintain the French garrison in (West) Germany" and avoid a break with France. The West German newspaper *Die Welt* said: "The Prime Minister and his Foreign Minister's approach to German-French relations has become the core of the Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union's criticism of Schroeder."

    北大西洋集团四分五裂的危机进一步发展
    戴高乐狠狠地将了艾哈德一军
    表示准备从西德撤军，反击西德及其支持者美国的压力
    波恩政府慌了手脚，急忙表示“欢迎”法军继续留驻西德
    新华社波恩电　这里在二十二日公布了法国政府给西德政府的一份照会。这份照会表明，西德政府在北大西洋集团问题上配合美国对法国施加压力的做法，遭到了戴高乐政府的猛烈反击。这种情况反映了北大西洋集团的危机进一步发展。
    这份照会是法国在十八日交给西德的，它阐述了法国政府在今年七月一日退出北大西洋集团司令部后法军是否留驻西德这个问题上的立场。自从法国宣布退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构后，一直以这个集团的招牌来掩盖西德军国主义复活的波恩政府就竭力使濒于瓦解的这个军事集团维持下去，同时又想利用法国退出的局势抬高西德的地位，因此在美国支持下向法国施压力。为此，波恩政府在五月三日给法国一个照会，提出了法军留驻西德的一系列条件，实际上是要把法国仍然套进北大西洋军事“一体化”的圈套中，并且要法国驻军在一定程度上受到西德的管辖。但是，西德也有求于法国，它害怕同法国闹翻将使自己同美国讨价还价的地位大大削弱，尤其害怕法国在德国问题上不再支持西德。因此，在提出上述照会的同时，波恩政府的领导人又说，西德还是“欢迎”法军留驻的。
    法国抓住西德这一弱点，在十八日的照会中要西德明确表示到底要不要法军留驻。它说，法国并不想把军队留在西德，而且准备从一九六六年七月开始撤走驻军，到一九六七年七月全部撤完，如果西德不愿意法军留驻的话。
    法国的照会表示，只有在西德欢迎法国军队留驻的前提下，法国才愿意同西德就法军在西德驻军的实际条件进行谈判。在这方面，法国驳斥了西德这一说法：法国退出北大西洋集团军事“一体化”机构后，就不能享有一九五四年关于西方盟国在西德驻军的协定所赋予的权利。照会强调说，把一九五四年协定稍加修改，就可以作为谈判的“适当的法律基础”。
    法国还特别抓住西德在德国问题上不能缺少法国的支持这一根本弱点，给西德以沉重的一击。它提醒西德，法国在根据一九五四年协定享受在西德驻军的“权利”的同时，也承担了在德国“重新统一”方面的“义务”。它在照会中警告说，谁怀疑法国驻军的权利，谁就是损害包括法国在内的四国对德国“重新统一”的“责任”。
    在谈到今后法国驻西德军队同北大西洋集团其他国家驻西德军队的关系时，法国只是重申了它在退出军事“一体化”机构后就法国军队同这个集团的“一体化”军队的关系所表示的态度。
    它在照会中说，法国愿意就相互之间根据北大西洋公约第五款的规定进行“合作”的问题进行谈判。这个条款规定，在公约签字国之一受到攻击时，其他签字国应提供它们认为必要的援助。
    法国的照会发表后，西方报界纷纷指出，照会的语调“强硬”，它表明法国迫西德作出“非此即彼的选择”。
    戴高乐政府这种以“强硬”对“强硬”的答复，特别是抛出了德国“重新统一”问题这张王牌，使西德政府慌了手脚，西德外长施罗德在二十二日慌忙出来表示，西德政府“欢迎”法国部队继续留在西德。波恩各党派领导人也纷纷表示要同法国谈判。
    西德以美国为后台向法国施压力，结果非但没有捞到任何实惠，反而使本来地位不稳的艾哈德政府再次遭到来自自己党内的猛烈攻击。以前总理阿登纳和基督教社会联盟主席、前国防部长施特劳斯为首的一派纷纷抨击西德给法国的照会“太冷淡”和“不必要地强硬”，要求“尽一切可能保持法国在（西）德国的驻军”，而避免同法国闹翻。西德《世界报》说：“总理和他的外长在德、法关系上的做法，已经成为基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟内部对施罗德进行批评的核心。”
