    "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman"
    We often sail overseas and deeply appreciate the enormous power of Mao Zedong Thought from what we see and hear. Seamen armed with Mao Zedong Thought must steer the giant ship of the Cultural Revolution, breaking through the poisonous fog of the Deng Tuo gang.
    Liu Fu, Seaman of the "Liaoyuan" Ship, China Ocean Shipping Company
    I am a New China ocean-going seaman. My heart is burning with boundless anger towards the monsters and demons of the "Three-Family Village" who attack our beloved Party and the great Mao Zedong Thought! We understand very well that with Mao Zedong Thought as our guiding light, we can overcome rapid currents and dangerous shoals and embark on the happy and prosperous socialist road. Today, you viciously slander our Party for "making enemies everywhere" and "losing popular support," and you want our Party to "rest" in a frenzy. This is simply tearing out the "heart" of our working class and digging out the lifeblood of our laboring people. Let me tell you plainly: the boundary between us and you is clear. Either you or us, either us or you!
    We often sail abroad. What we see and hear truly makes us appreciate the enormous power of Mao Zedong Thought. "We have friends all over the world," and our Party and country are very popular. In 1964, our "Liaoyuan" ship made its maiden voyage to Japan. When we arrived at Moji Port, it caused a sensation throughout Kitakyushu. On that day, fifty or sixty small boats were full of people who came to welcome us. They waved colorful flags, held up banners, and set off firecrackers. The docks were full of Japanese friends and overseas Chinese who shouted slogans to welcome us. When the ship arrived in Tokyo, it was also warmly welcomed in the same way. Among the welcoming crowd were many people who had traveled from other places to Tokyo. Everyone rushed to shake hands, and many people shed tears. A Japanese youth said excitedly, "You have brought Chinese goods, but we hope even more that you will bring Mao Zedong Thought." In Europe, Africa, and all over the world, the crew members of New China have been warmly welcomed. Old crew members feel these scenes most deeply. An old boatswain said, "Before liberation, I also went to various parts of the world. At that time, who looked up to us Chinese? Chinese seamen are recognized internationally for their diligence and bravery, but they can only do the dirtiest, hardest, and most tiring work. Today, we are no longer oppressed by others, but we can hold our heads high." Why is this so? It is because our motherland has become strong, because we are sailing our own manufactured giant ships, and all of this is the result of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. In Tobata, Japan, a Japanese friend said meaningfully, "From your ship and from you, I have seen the brilliance of the socialist system and felt the power of Mao Zedong Thought." An overseas Chinese who had lived in Japan for a long time came to our ship and said enthusiastically, "Did you bring water from the motherland? I want to drink a cup!" It is precisely because our country's prestige is so high and Mao Zedong Thought is so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people that the black gang of the "Three-Family Village" is afraid. You want our Party to "rest," not only we will not agree, but the revolutionary people of the whole world will not agree!
    Deng Tuo, you viciously sow discord between the Party and our laboring people, saying that our Party "does not cherish labor power." In fact, you bunch of bourgeois black gangs, you don't know how to work, you don't know how to farm, what do you know about cherishing labor power? Only we, the laboring people, know best what is meant by class exploitation and oppression, and we know most deeply the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. We often go to capitalist countries and see with our own eyes the miserable lives of the laboring people there. In Ceylon, we knew a dockworker who was over sixty years old. He worked from morning to night and still couldn't support his family. Old workers like this should have retired and be enjoying their old age in our country. The lives of Japanese workers are also so miserable. Some stevedores often come to our ship to beg for food, and it is commonplace for them to be beaten and scolded by the foremen. I personally saw three Japanese worker brothers who had work-related injuries. They were in great pain, rolling around everywhere in the warehouse, and the capitalists simply ignored them. It was we who applied medicine and bandaged them up. Later, we went to visit them with fruit, and they were moved to tears and said, "We have received 'human' treatment for the first time!" This is the Japanese working class's comment on the socialist system. Although it is a simple sentence, it fully expresses the Japanese working class's love for New China and their love for socialism.
    The Party and Chairman Mao not only care about our material life, but more importantly, they care for us spiritually, teaching us to have the motherland in our hearts, to have the world in our eyes, and to be thoroughgoing proletarian revolutionaries. We love Chairman Mao. Whether we are far away from our motherland or in the midst of raging waves, we have never stopped studying Chairman Mao's works. It is precisely because of Chairman Mao's teachings that we have resisted the erosion of bourgeois decadent ideas. Foreign friends cannot help but say, "We have never seen such good crew members. From your faces, we can see that your lives are happy and your labor is something to be proud of." Deng Tuo, do you know what caring means? This is the greatest care, the greatest happiness!
    What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what class speaks what kind of words, it is really not wrong at all. Deng Tuo is flattering revisionism and wants us to "unite" with them and worship them as "teachers." We firmly oppose this. What is the Soviet revisionist group? Let me talk about something I saw with my own eyes. In the summer of 1965, our ship arrived at Kobe Port in Japan, and a Soviet cargo ship was parked next to it. One afternoon, an American cargo ship was "shifting berths" (changing berths) in the port. When it passed by the Soviet cargo ship, the revisionists shamelessly sounded their horn to pay tribute to it, and also raised "signal flags" to wish it "bon voyage." However, the American ship ignored it and arrogantly sailed past. What a shameful thing this is! Deng Tuo, do you want us to learn the servile appearance of the revisionists?
    Deng Tuo, you handful of anti-Party elements, put on the airs of "spreading knowledge" and "discussing academics," using ancient things to satirize the present. Your black hands have already been caught. Now, you have raised the bourgeois slogan of "everyone is equal before the truth,"妄想 to sit on an equal footing with us. This is absolutely impossible. To tell you the truth, in class struggle, there is no abstract truth, only class truth. Why has *Qianxian* and *Beijing Ribao* been publishing a large amount of your anti-Party and anti-socialist stuff, while suppressing our articles criticizing you from workers, peasants, and soldiers, refusing to publish them? Is this "everyone is equal before the truth"? On this point, we will not be fooled. We can only exercise dictatorship over you handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. There is no "equality" to speak of at all.
    "Sailing the seas depends on the helmsman, all things grow thanks to the sun, rain and dew nourish the seedlings, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought…"
    These lyrics are especially intimate for us sailors. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can steer around reefs and see through fog in the boundless ocean, sailing in the right direction. Today, the monsters and demons of the "Three-Family Village" have spread poisonous fog and dust in front of us, attempting to lead us onto the capitalist path. You are daydreaming, wishful thinking.
    New China's seamen, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must steer the giant ship through the countercurrents in this Great Socialist Cultural Revolution, and must pick up our pens and sweep away all the demons.

### “大海航行靠舵手”

    “大海航行靠舵手”
    我们经常航行海外，从眼见耳闻中，深刻体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力。用毛泽东思想武装起来的海员，一定要驾驶文化革命的巨轮，冲破邓拓黑帮的毒雾迷尘
    中国远洋运输公司“燎原”轮海员　刘福
    我是新中国的远洋海员，对“三家村”这帮牛鬼蛇神攻击我们亲爱的党，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，真是火烧胸膛，无比愤怒！我们很懂得，有了毛泽东思想这盏指路明灯，我们才能战胜急流险滩，走上幸福康庄的社会主义大道。今天，你们恶毒地诬蔑我们的党“到处树敌”、“不得人心”，猖狂地要我们党“休息”。这简直是掏我们工人阶级的“心”，挖我们劳动人民的命根子。可以明白地告诉你们：我们与你们之间界限分明，有你无我，有我无你！
    我们经常航行国外。眼见耳闻，真正体会到毛泽东思想的巨大威力，“我们的朋友遍天下”，我们的党和国家非常得人心。一九六四年，我们“燎原”轮首航日本。到门司港时，轰动了整个北九州。当天，有五六十艘小艇满载欢迎的人们，他们挥舞彩旗，举着标语牌，燃放鞭炮；码头上站满了日本朋友和华侨，他们高呼口号迎接我们。船到东京，也受到同样的热烈欢迎。欢迎的人群中，有许多是从外地赶来东京的，大家争相握手，许多人流出了热泪。有个日本青年激动地说：“你们运来了中国的货物，更希望你们运来毛泽东思想。”在欧洲、非洲，在全世界，新中国的船员都受到了热情欢迎。老船员对这些情景感受最深，一位老水手长说：“解放以前，我也到过世界各地，那时候谁看得起咱们中国人呢？中国海员勤劳、勇敢，在国际上是公认的，但只能干着最脏最苦最累的工作。今天我们不再受人欺压，而是扬眉吐气了。”为什么能够如此？就因为我们的祖国强大起来了，因为我们驾驶着自己制造的巨轮，而这一切是党和毛主席领导的结果。在日本户畑，有位日本朋友意味深长地说：“从你们的船上和你们的身上，我看到了社会主义制度的光辉，体会到毛泽东思想的力量。”一位久居日本的华侨来到我们船上，热情地说：“你们带来祖国的水吗？我要喝一杯呵！”正是由于我们国家的威望是如此之高，毛泽东思想如此深入人心，“三家村”的黑帮们害怕了。你们要我们党“休息”，不仅我们不答应，就是全世界的革命人民也不答应！
    邓拓，你恶毒地挑拨党和我们劳动人民的关系，说我们党“不爱护劳动力”。其实，你们这伙资产阶级黑帮，一不会做工，二不会种地，懂得什么叫爱护劳动力？只有我们劳动人民，才最懂得什么叫阶级的剥削和压迫，最深知党和毛主席的恩情。我们经常到资本主义国家去，亲眼看见那里的劳动人民的悲惨生活。在锡兰，我们认识的一位六十多岁的码头工人，他从早干到晚，还养不活一家人。象这样的老工人，要是在我们国家里，早就该退休养老了。日本工人的生活也是这样悲惨。有些装卸工人经常到我们船上讨东西吃，被工头打骂更是家常便饭。我亲眼见过三个日本工人弟兄出了工伤事故，他们在大仓里痛的到处乱滚，资本家根本不理睬，还是由我们给他们敷药包扎的。后来，我们带着水果去慰问，他们感动得流着泪说：“我们第一次受到了‘人’的待遇！”这是日本工人阶级对社会主义制度的评语，这虽然是简单的一句话，却充分地表达了日本工人阶级对新中国的热爱，对社会主义的热爱。
    党和毛主席不仅关心我们的物质生活，更重要的是从精神上关怀我们，教导我们胸怀祖国，放眼世界，做一个无产阶级的彻底革命者。我们热爱毛主席，无论在远离祖国的地方，还是在惊涛骇浪之中，我们从来没有停止过学习毛主席的著作。正是由于毛主席的教导，我们抵制了资产阶级腐朽思想的侵蚀。外国的朋友也不能不说：“我们从来没有见过这样好的船员，从你们的脸上就能看到你们的生活是幸福的，你们的劳动是自豪的。”邓拓，你们懂得什么叫关怀？这就是最大的关怀，最大的幸福！
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话，真是一点不假。邓拓大拍修正主义的马屁，要我们同他们搞“团结”，拜他们当“老师”。我们坚决反对。苏联修正主义集团是什么东西？让我谈件亲眼看到的事。一九六五年夏天，我们轮船到达日本神户港，旁边停着一条苏联货船。一天下午，一艘美国货船在港内“移泊”（调换泊位），当它从苏联货船旁边经过时，修正主义者竟然无耻地向它鸣笛致敬，还升起了“旗号”祝“一路平安”。可是，这条美国船毫不理睬，傲慢地开了过去。这是多么丢人的丑事！邓拓，难道你要我们也去学修正主义者那副卑躬屈膝的奴才相吗？
    邓拓，你们这一小撮反党分子，摆出了“传知识”、“论学术”的夫子面孔，借古讽今。你们的黑手已经被抓住了。现在，你们又抬出了什么“在真理面前人人平等”的资产阶级口号，妄想同我们平起平坐，这是绝对办不到的。老实告诉你们，在阶级斗争中，没有什么抽象的真理，只有阶级的真理。《前线》《北京日报》为什么对你们反党反社会主义的东西一直是大量刊登，而对我们工农兵批判你们的文章，却扣压起来不给发表，这难道是“在真理面前人人平等”吗？在这一点上，我们不会上当。对你们一小撮反党反社会主义分子，我们只能实行专政，根本没有什么“平等”可讲。
    “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。
    ……”
    这首歌词对我们海员来说，格外亲切。有了毛泽东思想，就能使我们在无边无际的海洋中绕过暗礁，透过迷雾，朝着正确的方向航行。今天，“三家村”的牛鬼蛇神在我们面前撒出了毒雾迷尘，企图把我们引向资本主义的航道，这是你们在白日作梦，痴心妄想。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国海员，在这场社会主义文化大革命中，一定要驾驶巨轮冲破逆流，一定要拿起笔杆扫尽妖魔。
