    Standing on the anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist position, Wu Han always sang the opposite tune to the revolutionary people in every time and in every matter.

    On the issue of war, he clearly stood on the pro-Chiang, pro-American, and anti-communist position, yet he portrayed himself as a "fair" "third party." He posed as a "people's representative" and a "savior," peddling his anti-communist and anti-people private goods. Wu Han lumped together revolutionary just wars and counter-revolutionary unjust wars, creating various reactionary fallacies to greatly help Chiang Kai-shek.

    After the "September 18th Incident," the iron heel of Japanese fascism stepped into China. The people, unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, waged the War of Resistance against Japan under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. However, Wu Han hated the national salvation movement of resistance against Japan, and viciously scolded the national salvation movement as "window dressing," "showing off fashionable trends," "a swarm of people," and "scattering like birds and beasts"..., At the same time, he actively advised Chiang Kai-shek in an attempt to eliminate the people's revolutionary movement.

    In 1946, following the Japanese fascists, came the great civil war in which American imperialism provided money and guns, and Chiang Kai-shek provided the manpower to slaughter the Chinese people. At this time, the Party and Chairman Mao led the people of the whole country in a resolute war of self-defense. Wu Han, again acting as Chiang Kai-shek's vanguard against communism and the people, rushed into battle and greatly helped him. In order to alienate the flesh-and-blood relationship between our Party and the masses and undermine the War of Resistance, he launched vicious attacks on our Party, nonsensically saying, "Your Party history, your Party program, your self-aggrandizing propaganda, we the people, to be honest, are not very interested." In order to disintegrate the people's fighting will, deceive the people into laying down their arms and surrendering to the Kuomintang, he again fabricated things such as, "If the two parties hold each other, the people will suffer, and it will not be good to anger the people." When soft tactics didn't work, he used hard tactics, and when deception failed, he resorted to intimidation, arrogantly shouting: "The Kuomintang will never be able to eliminate the Communist Party, and vice versa, the Communist Party will not be able to eliminate the Kuomintang."

    How to treat war, our revolutionary's attitude has always been distinct. We oppose all counter-revolutionary unjust wars; we support all revolutionary just wars. Chairman Mao taught us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without them, the leap in social development cannot be completed, and the reactionary ruling class cannot be overthrown, and the people cannot gain political power." The history of the Chinese revolution proves this truth, and the revolutionary history of the world, both now and in the future, will continue to confirm this truth. It is true that war is arduous, and there will be sacrifices. However, we clearly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." Just imagine, without twenty-two years of arduous struggle, where would today's happy life come from? In order to carry the Chinese and world revolution through to the end, we are all willing to be "believers in the omnipotence of revolutionary war."

    We warn Wu Han that our iron socialist state will never be shaken by any reactionaries. If they dare to take risks, we will use revolutionary just war to bury them. This is the inevitable law of historical development.

    革命者如何看待战争
                        刘增喜
    吴晗站在反党、反人民、反社会主义的立场上，时时、事事同革命的人民唱反调。
    在对待战争的问题上，他明明站在亲蒋、崇美、反共的立场上，却把自己标榜为“公正”的“第三者”。他以“人民代表”、“救世主”的身份自居，贩卖其反共、反人民的私货。吴晗把革命的正义战争和反革命的非正义战争混为一谈，制造了种种反动谬论对蒋介石大帮其忙。
    “九一八”事变后，日本法西斯的铁蹄踏进中国。不愿做亡国奴的人民，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，进行了抗日战争。然而，吴晗却对抗日救亡运动恨之入骨，破口大骂救亡运动是“装门面”、“显时髦”、“一窝蜂”、“鸟兽散”……，同时，他又积极为蒋介石出谋献策，企图消灭人民革命运动。
    一九四六年，继日本法西斯而来的是由美帝国主义出钱、出枪，蒋介石出人屠杀中国人民的大内战。这时，党和毛主席领导全国人民进行了坚决的自卫战争。而吴晗又当了蒋介石反共反人民的马前卒，匆忙上阵，大帮其忙。他为了离间我党和群众的血肉关系，破坏抗战，对我党进行了恶毒的攻击，胡说什么“你们的党史，你们的党纲，你们自吹自擂的宣传品，我们人民，老实说，都不大感兴趣。”他为了瓦解人民的抗战斗志，欺骗人民放下武器向国民党投降，又胡诌什么“两党相持，人民受罪，结怒于人民是不会有什么好处的。”他软的不行来硬的，欺骗不成又来恫吓，狂妄的叫喊：“国民党决消灭不了共产党，反之，共产党也消灭不了国民党。”
    如何对待战争，我们革命者的态度从来是泾渭分明的。我们反对一切反革命的非正义战争；拥护一切革命的正义战争。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”中国革命的历史证明了这一真理，世界上现在和将来的革命历史，都将继续证实这一真理。不错，战争是艰苦的，也是会有牺牲的。但是，我们清楚地记住毛主席的教导：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”试想，没有二十二年的艰苦斗争，那有今天的幸福生活？为了把中国和世界革命进行到底，我们都愿做“革命战争万能论者”。
    我们警告吴晗，我国铁打的社会主义江山，一切反动派都休想动撼。如果他们胆敢冒险，我们就将采用革命的正义战争把他们埋葬。这是历史发展的必然规律。
