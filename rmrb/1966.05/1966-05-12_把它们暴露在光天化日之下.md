    Expose them to the Light of Day
    Huang Zushi, Political Instructor of a Unit of the Guangzhou Military Region of the PLA

    When the people of our country, filled with righteous indignation and united as one, were ferreting out the demons and monsters of the "Three-Family Village," *Qianxian* (Frontline) and *Beijing Ribao* (Beijing Daily) completely stood on the position of the bourgeoisie, hypocritically publishing articles "criticizing" Deng Tuo, using the name of criticism to actually cover up and exonerate Deng Tuo. They attempted to abolish class struggle, abolish revolution, and build air-raid shelters for demons and monsters. This will never succeed.

    Deng Tuo is a big ringleader of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, the boss of the "Three-Family Village" black inn jointly run with Wu Han and Liao Mosha. They shamelessly took advantage of the natural disasters our country suffered and the modern revisionists' delusions of strangling us, coordinating with other right-leaning opportunists, shooting the poisonous arrows of *Yanshan Yehua* (Yanshan Night Talks) and *Sanjiacun Zhaji* (Notes from Three-Family Village), launching vicious attacks on our great Party and our great socialist system. Their rampant attacks were by no means accidental. Because the people of the whole country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stirred up an irresistible revolutionary torrent, strongly impacting capitalist and feudal remnants, it was bound to be opposed by Deng Tuo and his gang, who stubbornly clung to the bourgeois world outlook and were unwilling to withdraw from the stage of history. However, under the historical conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, these bourgeois elements adopted concealed, cunning, and circuitous methods, waving "red flags" to oppose the red flag, using their powers, putting on the appearance of "experts" and "authorities," taking culture and art as a stubborn fortress for attacking the Party and socialism, transforming anti-Party and anti-socialist ideas through writing articles, telling history, transmitting knowledge, and telling jokes, singing a counter-tune to Mao Zedong Thought, and paving the way for capitalist restoration. We must ferret out this gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist great villains and expose their ugly faces to the light of day.

    However, *Qianxian* (Frontline) and *Beijing Ribao* (Beijing Daily) have not only long served as tools for these demons and monsters to oppose the Party and socialism, but are still now laying smoke screens and providing cover for anti-Party elements. This situation provides us with very good negative teaching material, making us more clearly remember Chairman Mao's teaching about never forgetting class struggle, and never thinking that "scholars rebelling will not succeed in three years." We must know that for thousands of years, landlords and capitalists have ridden on the heads of the working people, monopolized culture, and used it to paralyze the working people; if after liberation, we still allow their agents to occupy the cultural fortress and constantly attack the Party and socialism, then it will not be long before our country changes color. Therefore, we revolutionary fighters must use the hands that hold guns to pick up the revolutionary pen, take Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and take the viewpoint of class struggle as our bullets, to fire on the black line of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, fire on the bourgeois "authorities," and create a world where workers, peasants, and soldiers control the pen, and completely destroy the remaining capitalist and feudal positions in the political, economic, and cultural fields.

    把它们暴露在光天化日之下
    解放军广州部队某部政治指导员　黄祖示
    当我国人民义愤填膺、团结一致，揪出“三家村”的牛鬼蛇神的时候，《前线》和《北京日报》完全站在资产阶级立场，假惺惺地发表了“批判”邓拓的文章，借批判之名，行掩护之实，为邓拓开脱罪责。他们企图取消阶级斗争，取消革命，为牛鬼蛇神砌防空洞，这是万万办不到的。
    邓拓是反党反社会主义的一个大头头，是和吴晗、廖沫沙合伙经营的“三家村”黑店的掌柜。他们无耻地利用我国遭到自然灾害和现代修正主义妄想卡住我们的脖子的时候，配合其它右倾机会主义分子，射出了《燕山夜话》《三家村札记》的毒箭，向我们伟大的党、伟大的社会主义制度进行了恶毒的进攻。他们的猖狂进攻决不是偶然的现象。因为全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，激起了一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，强烈地冲击着资本主义和封建残余势力，必然会受到死抱着资产阶级世界观、不甘心退出历史舞台的邓拓一伙的反对。但是，在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，这些资产阶级分子，采取的是隐蔽、狡猾、迂回曲折的手法，打着“红旗”反红旗，利用他们的职权，摆出“专家”、“权威”的面貌，把文化艺术作为向党向社会主义进攻的顽固堡垒，通过写文章、讲历史、传知识、说笑话，把反党反社会主义思想改头换面，与毛泽东思想唱对台戏，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。我们一定要把这伙反党反社会主义的大恶棍揪出来，把他们的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下。
    可是，《前线》和《北京日报》不仅长期作为这些牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义的工具，并且在现在仍为反党分子放烟幕，打掩护。这种情况向我们提供了很好的反面教材，使我们更加清醒地记住毛主席关于千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，千万不能认为“秀才造反三年不成”。要知道，几千年来，地主、资本家骑在劳动人民头上，垄断了文化，并且用来麻痹劳动人民；如果解放以后，仍然听任他们的代理人盘踞文化堡垒，不断向党向社会主义进攻，那么不要多久，就会使我们的国家变颜色。因此，我们革命战士要用拿枪杆子的手，拿起革命的笔杆子来，以毛泽东思想为武器，以阶级斗争的观点为子弹，向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，向资产阶级“权威”开火，打出一个工农兵掌握笔杆子的天下，从政治、经济和文化各个领域里，把资本主义和封建主义残余阵地彻底摧毁。
