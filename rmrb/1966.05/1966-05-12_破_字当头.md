“Breakthrough” at the Forefront
    Xin Wu
    In this world, the birth of any new thing must go through a severe struggle with the old things to be realized. To "establish" the new, one must first "break" the old. This is a law.
    The socialist Cultural Revolution is also like this. In this great revolution, to "establish," one must first "break," and "breakthrough" must be at the forefront.
    "Break" what? "Break" the ideas of the feudal class, the bourgeoisie, and revisionism, "break" all the ideologies of the exploiting classes that poison the masses, "break" the monopoly of bourgeois "authorities," "scholars," and "experts" in the cultural field, and "break" the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line in the cultural field. For all these monsters and demons, we must resolutely "break" them, fiercely "break" them, and thoroughly "break" them.
    "If poisonous weeds are not hoed, crops will not grow." The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are irreconcilable, Marxism and all exploiting class ideologies that poison the masses are incompatible, and the new socialist culture and the culture of feudalism and capitalism cannot "peacefully coexist." If all monsters and demons are not "broken" down, Marxist thought cannot occupy the cultural front, and the proletariat's leadership in the cultural field cannot be established. In short, without thorough "breakthrough," there can be no real "establishment."
    The history of the birth of Marxism is actually a history with "breakthrough" at the forefront. Marx and Engels "broke" Hegel's idealism philosophy before they "established" the philosophy of dialectical materialism; they "broke" Ricardo's classical economics before they "established" Marxist economics; they "broke" utopian socialism before they "established" scientific socialism.
    In "On New Democracy," Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly expounded the relationship between "breakthrough" and "establishment": If reactionary culture is not overthrown, no new culture can be established. That's how it is. Why have there been so few good works serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism in the dozen years since liberation? It is because an anti-Party and anti-socialist black line has controlled the literary and artistic circles. If this black line is not "broken" down, new socialist literature and art can never be truly "established." Isn't this principle crystal clear!
    "The golden monkey rises up with a cudgel of ten thousand tons, clearing away the dust for ten thousand miles of the jade-like sky." Only with "breakthrough" at the forefront, "rising up" with the proletariat's "cudgel of ten thousand tons," can we defeat the monsters and demons, and "clear away the dust for ten thousand miles" in the cultural field, clearing the way for the establishment of a brilliant new socialist culture. The significance of "breakthrough," of course, is not only to clear the way for "establishment"; "discarding the old" can "bring forth the new," and in the process of "breaking" the old, "new" things will inevitably be "established." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "There is struggle, then there is development." In the current socialist Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken up the weapon of literary and artistic criticism and actively participated in the battle, and have begun to establish a revolutionary, combatant, and mass-based literary and artistic criticism force in our country. Isn't this "establishment" with epoch-making significance developing in the midst of "breakthrough"!
    A major "breakthrough" of the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line is the most important and most urgent task of the current socialist Cultural Revolution.
    "Breakthrough" is struggle; "breakthrough" is revolution. To "breakthrough" the enemies with guns, we must carry out "the criticism of weapons"; to "breakthrough" the enemies without guns, we must grasp "the weapon of criticism." "Riding the waves in the midstream"! Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take up "the weapon of criticism," and throw ourselves into the "midstream" of this great struggle to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois, resolutely smash the black line!

    “破”字当头
    辛午
    世界上任何一个新事物，它的出生，都是要经过同旧事物的严重斗争才能实现的。要“立”新的，就得先“破”旧的。这是一条规律。
    社会主义的文化大革命也是如此。在这场大革命中，要“立”，就得先“破”，就得“破”字当头。
    “破”什么？“破”封建阶级的、资产阶级的、修正主义的思想，“破”一切剥削阶级毒害人民群众的意识形态，“破”资产阶级的“权威”、“学者”、“专家”在文化界的垄断地位，“破”文化界的反党反社会主义的黑线。对于这一切牛鬼蛇神，必须坚决的“破”，狠狠的“破”，彻底的“破”。
      “毒草不锄，庄稼不长。”无产阶级同资产阶级是势不两立的，马克思主义同一切剥削阶级毒害人民群众的意识形态是不共戴天的，社会主义的新文化同封建主义、资本主义的文化是不能“和平共处”的。不“破”掉一切牛鬼蛇神，马克思主义的思想就不能占领文化阵地，无产阶级在文化领域中的领导权就不能确立。总之，不彻底“破”，就不能真正“立”。
    马克思主义诞生的历史，实际上是一部“破”字当头的历史。马克思和恩格斯，“破”了黑格尔的唯心主义哲学，才“立”起了辩证唯物主义的哲学；“破”了李嘉图的古典经济学，才“立”起了马克思主义的经济学；“破”了空想的社会主义，才“立”起了科学的社会主义。
    毛泽东同志在《新民主主义论》中，深刻地阐明了“破”和“立”的关系：不把反动的文化打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。事情就是这样。解放后的十几年来，为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的好作品为什么不多呢？就是因为一条反党反社会主义的黑线控制了文艺界。如果不把这条黑线“破”掉，社会主义的新文艺就休想真正“立”起来。这个道理难道还不是一清二楚的么！
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”只有“破”字当头，“奋起”无产阶级的“千钧棒”，才能打倒牛鬼蛇神，才能在文化领域中“澄清万里埃”，为建立光辉灿烂的社会主义新文化扫清道路。“破”的意义，当然还不只是为“立”扫清道路；“推陈”可以“出新”，在“破”旧的过程中也必然会“立”出“新”的东西来。毛泽东同志说过：“有斗争，才能发展。”在当前的社会主义文化大革命中，广大工农兵群众拿起了文艺批评的武器，积极参加了战斗，在我国开始建立起一支革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评队伍。这个具有划时代意义的“立”，不正是在“破”中发展起来的么！
    大“破”反党反社会主义的黑线，是当前社会主义文化大革命的最重要、最迫切的任务。
    “破”，就是斗争；“破”，就是革命。“破”拿枪的敌人，必须进行“武器的批判”；“破”不拿枪的敌人，就得掌握“批判的武器”。“到中流击水”！让我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，拿起“批判的武器”，投到这个兴无灭资大斗争的“中流”去，坚决击破黑线！
