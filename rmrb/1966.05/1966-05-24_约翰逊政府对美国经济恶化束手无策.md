Title: Johnson Government Helpless in the Face of Worsening US Economy

    The Johnson government is deeply troubled by the recent continuous deterioration of the American economy. With rising prices and accelerating inflation, divisions within the US ruling group over how to stem the economic deterioration are deepening, and debates are becoming increasingly heated.
    A group of economic experts, led by Heller, former chief economic advisor to President Kennedy, has been issuing warnings since late April, demanding immediate tax increases to curb dangerous inflation. Martin, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, also publicly echoed this. However, Treasury Secretary Fowler and Johnson's chief economic advisor, Ackley, and others expressed opposition. They believe that rash tax increases are likely to accelerate the arrival of a crisis of production "surplus."
    Amidst the endless quarreling, Johnson issued a statement on May 4, admitting that "worrisome symptoms are beginning to appear" in the American economy. However, he neither indicated that he would raise taxes nor that he would not raise taxes, but instead asked his "Labor-Management Policy Advisory Committee" to help him consider developing a plan that would both prevent inflation and maintain America's "lasting prosperity." But how is this possible? The current so-called "prosperity" in the United States is caused by inflation policies. To maintain false "prosperity," inflation cannot be prevented; to prevent inflation, "prosperity" cannot be maintained. Johnson wants to ride two horses at the same time and asks people to come up with ideas for him, which is clearly self-deception.
    The Johnson government's indecisiveness and reluctance to make a firm decision on domestic economic policy are inseparable from the following current state of the US economy:
    First, since April, the three pillars of the US economy—the automotive, construction, and steel industries—have shown a downward trend. Among them, especially the automotive industry. In April, nearly 1.6 million cars were stockpiled, setting an unprecedented record, and the three major automobile companies successively announced production cuts. It is estimated that the adjusted output, from May to July, will be 7% lower than originally planned and 11% lower than the same period last year. The housing construction industry has been sluggish for two years. Recently, an unfavorable situation of declining start-up rates has emerged. The steel industry has already been adjusting its investments due to excessive expansion. Now, production cuts in the automotive industry further foreshadow a possible decline in new steel orders.
    Second, the continued rise in prices has far exceeded the limit of 1.2% per year, which is considered "tolerable." Even according to official figures, the consumer price index for April this year was 2.9% higher than a year ago, and the wholesale price index for April was even 4.1% higher than a year ago. However, the degree of inflation felt by the people in their daily lives is far higher than what these indices show.
    Third, the New York stock market has recently experienced consecutive declines, reflecting a lack of confidence in the economic outlook. As early as February of this year, the New York stock market plummeted due to news of tighter monetary policy and tax increases. Since the beginning of this month, with General Motors' announcement of production cuts and further declines in automobile sales in early May, New York stock prices have fallen steadily. At the close of trading on May 16, the Dow Jones stock price index was about 130 points lower than its peak of 995 points in February. This situation, occurring while corporate profits continue to reach record highs, particularly demonstrates investors' extreme nervousness about the business outlook.
    Fourth, foreign trade continues to decline, and gold reserves have fallen to new lows. With the development of domestic inflation, the export conditions for American goods have further deteriorated. Despite the Johnson government's efforts to reverse the unfavorable development of foreign trade, the trade surplus in the first quarter of this year continued to decline. At the same time, due to increased military spending in the Vietnam War, the US balance of payments situation deteriorated. The balance of payments deficit in the first quarter was more than 580 million US dollars, an increase of nearly one-third compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The current US gold reserves have decreased to 13.5 billion US dollars, the lowest level in 28 years. Short-term debts held by foreigners that can be exchanged for gold are as high as 27.6 billion US dollars, which is more than twice the US gold reserves. The credibility of the US dollar has become increasingly shaky.
    Each of the above aspects reflects the fundamental weakness of the false "prosperity" of the American economy. Therefore, even those so-called representatives of the "New Economics" school on Johnson's Economic Advisory Committee feel uncertain about the economic prospects for the next few months and the beginning of next year.
    The May 13 issue of the American magazine *Time* commented that the American economy "is facing the most complex situation it has faced in the 1960s." The article believes that Johnson must now make "one of the most difficult decisions" since he took office: "Whether to raise taxes to curb the inflation that will inevitably lead to an economic downturn later on, or not to raise taxes for fear that tax increases will harm this year's business activity."

### 约翰逊政府对美国经济恶化束手无策

    约翰逊政府对美国经济恶化束手无策
    美国经济最近不断恶化的情况已经引起约翰逊政府的严重不安。随着物价上涨和通货膨胀的加剧，美国统治集团内部在如何制止经济恶化问题上的分歧越来越深，争论也越来越激烈。
    以前总统肯尼迪首席经济顾问海勒为首的一批经济专家，四月下旬以来不断发出警告，要求立刻增税，制止危险的通货膨胀。联邦储备局局长马丁也公开响应。但是，财政部长福勒和约翰逊的首席经济顾问阿克利等人却表示反对。他们认为，冒然增税，很可能加速一场生产“过剩”危机的到来。
    在双方争吵不休中，约翰逊于五月四日发表了一项声明，承认美国经济中“正在开始出现值得忧虑的症象”。但是，他既不表示要增税，也不表示不增税，而是要求他的“劳资政策顾问委员会”帮助他考虑制订一项既能防止通货膨胀，又能保持住美国的“持久繁荣”的方案。可是，这又怎样可能呢？美国目前的所谓“繁荣”，就是依靠通货膨胀政策造成的。要保持虚假的“繁荣”，就不能防止通货膨胀，要防止通货膨胀，就不能保持“繁荣”。而约翰逊竟想同时脚踏两只船，并要人们替他想办法，这显然是自欺欺人。
    约翰逊政府在国内经济政策上这样举棋不定，不敢轻下决心，是同目前美国经济的下列情况分不开的：
    一，从四月份以来，美国经济的三大支柱——汽车、建筑和钢铁工业，都出现不景气的趋势。其中特别是汽车业。四月份积压汽车将近一百六十万辆，创造了前所未有的纪录，三大汽车公司先后宣布削减生产。据估计，调整后的产量，从五月到七月将比原计划低百分之七，比去年同期低百分之十一。房屋建筑本来已有两年不大景气。最近又出现开工率下降的不妙情况。钢铁业已经因为过分扩充而在调整投资。现在汽车业削减生产，更是预示了钢铁新定货有可能下降的趋势。
    二，物价的继续上涨，已远超过被认为是“可以容忍的”每年百分之一点二的限度。即使按照官方公布的数字，今年四月份的消费物价指数也比一年前高了百分之二点九，批发物价指数四月份更是比一年前高出百分之四点一。但是，人民在日常生活中感受到的通货膨胀程度，远比这些指数表现的为高。
    三，纽约股票市场的行情，最近又连续下跌。反映了人们对经济前景缺乏信心。早在今年二月间，纽约股票市场就曾因为有消息说要收紧银根和增税，而出现暴跌。本月初以来，随着通用汽车公司的宣布减产和五月上旬汽车销售量进一步下降，纽约股票价格节节下跌。五月十六日收盘时，道·琼斯编的股票价格指数比二月最高时的九九五点强，低了约一百三十点。这种情况发生在公司利润继续达到破纪录高度的情况下，特别表明投资者对于企业前景的极度神经紧张。
    四，对外贸易继续走下坡路，黄金储备下降到新的低点。随着国内通货膨胀趋势的发展，美国商品的出口条件进一步恶化。尽管约翰逊政府在竭力扭转对外贸易的不利发展，今年第一季度贸易出超额仍在继续下降。同时，由于侵越军费的增加，美国国际收支状况恶化。第一季度国际收支逆差五亿八千多万美元，比去年第四季度增加近三分之一。现在美国黄金储备已减少到一百三十五亿美元，为二十八年以来的最低点。目前握在外国人手中可以向美国兑换黄金的短期债权，已达二百七十六亿美元之巨，即超过美国黄金储备两倍。美元的信用，已益加动摇。
    以上的每一方面，都反映出美国经济虚假“繁荣”的根本弱点。因此连约翰逊经济顾问委员会的那些所谓“新经济学派”的代表人物，也对未来几个月和明年开始的经济前景感到没有把握。
    五月十三日一期美国《时代》周刊在评论中指出，美国经济“正面临着它在六十年代里最复杂的局势”。文章认为，约翰逊目前必须作出自他上台以来“最困难的决定之一：究竟是提高税收，以制止那种不可避免地会在以后导致经济下降的通货膨胀，或者是不增税，因为害怕增税会损害今年的企业活动”。　（史）
