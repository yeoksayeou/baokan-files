    Editor's Note: The following selected letters from workers, peasants, and soldiers express their determination to actively participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution and thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line existing on the cultural front.

    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Socialist Cultural Revolution. These letters say it well: "Our working class must be at the forefront of this struggle, acting as warriors charging into battle." "The Cultural Revolution is a serious class struggle. We rural women cannot ignore it!" "We must not only continue to hold our guns tightly, but also pick up our pens and actively participate in this Socialist Cultural Revolution." With the participation of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the cultural front, it is time for bourgeois "authorities" to roll off the stage of history.

    The Socialist Cultural Revolution is a crucial issue for the in-depth development of our country's socialist revolution at the present stage. It is an issue of overall importance, a top priority concerning the fate and future of our Party and country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers must actively mobilize, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promote proletarian ideas and eradicate bourgeois ones, and open fire on all monsters and demons. We will not stop fighting until we achieve complete victory!

    Currently, our country is undergoing a profound Socialist Cultural Revolution. On the cultural front, a red line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is engaged in a fierce struggle with a black, anti-Party, and anti-socialist line of the bourgeoisie. Our working class must be at the forefront of this struggle, acting as warriors charging into battle. The April 18th editorial of the *Liberation Army Daily*, "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Actively Participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution," has sounded a clear bugle call for us to charge forward.

    Bourgeois things, revisionist things, have long occupied our cultural sphere. Now we must give them a resolute and merciless rebuff. Although they do not have murderous knives and guns in their hands, they have pens. Through movies, dramas, novels, and other forms, they frantically attack the Party and socialism. They have launched a black line in the literary and art circles, singing a tune contrary to Mao Zedong Thought. While we are engaged in socialist construction and ideological revolutionization, they are using literature and art to give us intoxicating drugs. While we say socialism is good, they say socialism is "dark." While we praise the Party, they glorify emperors, kings, generals, and ministers. While we want to learn from socialist heroes, they are obsessed with talented scholars and beautiful women. While we want to write epics about worker, peasant, and soldier heroes, they promote "middle characters." While we have deep-seated hatred for class enemies, they say there are also good people and kind human nature among the enemies, asking us to shake hands and make peace with them. While we want to vigorously publicize Mao Zedong Thought and the idea of people's war, they want to "deviate from the classics and rebel against orthodoxy," deviating from the classics of Mao Zedong Thought and rebelling against the principles of people's war. While we want to establish a worldview of not fearing hardship or death and serving the people wholeheartedly, they advocate the bourgeois and modern revisionist philosophy of survival. What we need are revolutionary literary and artistic works that are full of political enthusiasm and can inspire us to move forward, but what they produce are all kinds of filthy and decadent things that erode our revolutionary will... In short, they use all means and methods to obliterate class struggle, reconcile class contradictions, and oppose our Party and socialism in every possible way. If we do not thoroughly settle accounts with them and completely eliminate this black line, there is a danger of "peaceful evolution," a danger of capitalist restoration, a danger of the Party and the country perishing!

    The strength of the bourgeoisie in the cultural and artistic circles is indeed still considerable. For example, there is Xia Yan in the film industry, Tian Han in the drama industry, and Wu Han and Jian Bozan in the historical circles. These people are all "leading figures" and "authorities" in the cultural and artistic circles. Today, the working people are in charge and have become masters, but the cultural arts are still basically controlled by these bourgeois elements. This is absolutely intolerable! No matter what "authority" they are, we, with hands that wield hammers, must also pick up pens and wage a tit-for-tat battle with them, overthrowing them. The bugle call has sounded! Our working class must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand at the forefront of the struggle, and completely defeat all monsters and demons.

    工人阶级要站在斗争最前列
    北京铁路局丰台机务段工人  周系皋
    编者按：这里选登的几封工农兵来信，表示他们决心积极参加社会主义文化大革命，彻底搞掉文化战线上存在的反党反社会主义的黑线。
    工农兵群众是社会主义文化大革命的主力。这几封来信说得好：“我们工人阶级在这场斗争中要走在前头，作冲锋陷阵的战士。”“文化革命是一场严重的阶级斗争。我们农村妇女不能不管！”“我们不仅要继续握紧枪杆子，也要拿起笔杆子，积极参加这场社会主义文化大革命。”在文化战线上，工农兵参战了，是资产阶级“权威”滚下历史舞台的时候了。
    社会主义文化大革命，是现阶段我国社会主义革命深入发展的关键问题，是关系全局的问题，是关系到我们党和国家命运和前途的头等大事。广大工农兵群众积极行动起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，兴无灭资，向一切牛鬼蛇神开火，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    目前，我国正在进行一场深入的社会主义文化大革命。在文化战线上，一条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的红线，正在和一条资产阶级的反党反社会主义的黑线进行着激烈的斗争。我们工人阶级在这场斗争中要跑在前头，作冲锋陷阵的战士。《解放军报》四月十八日社论《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命》，给我们吹起了响亮的冲锋号。
    资产阶级的东西，修正主义的东西，长久占据着我们的文化领域，现在我们要给予坚决的、无情的回击。他们手里虽然没有杀人的刀枪，但是他们手里有笔，通过电影、戏剧、小说等形式，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。他们在文艺界搞起了一条黑线，和毛泽东思想唱对台戏。我们搞社会主义建设，搞思想革命化，他们却通过文艺给我们灌迷魂汤；我们说社会主义好，他们却说社会主义如何“阴暗”；我们歌颂党，他们却吹捧帝王将相；我们要向社会主义英雄人物学习，他们却大搞什么才子佳人；我们要大写工农兵英雄人物，他们却抬出什么“中间人物”；我们对阶级敌人有着刻骨的仇恨，他们却说敌人中也有好人，也有善良的人性，要我们和他们握手言欢；我们要大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传人民战争的思想，他们却要
  “离经叛道”，离毛泽东思想之经，叛人民战争之道；我们要树立一不怕苦二不怕死，全心全意为人民服务的人生观，他们却宣扬资产阶级、现代修正主义的活命哲学；我们需要的是政治热情饱满、能鼓舞我们前进的革命的文艺作品，他们搞出的却是那些腐蚀我们革命意志的乌七八糟的东西……。总之，他们通过一切途径，运用一切方式，抹煞阶级斗争，调和阶级矛盾，千方百计、无孔不入地反对我们的党，反对社会主义。如果我们不和他们彻底清算，不把这条黑线彻底搞掉，那就有“和平演变”的危险，有资本主义复辟的危险，有亡党亡国的危险！
    资产阶级在文化艺术界的实力确实还不小，如电影界里有夏衍，戏剧界里有田汉，史学界里有吴晗、翦伯赞，这些人都是文化艺术界的“头头脑脑”，都是“权威”人物。今天，劳动人民当家作了主人，可是文化艺术基本上还被这些资产阶级分子把持着。这是绝对不能容忍的事情！管他们什么“权威”不“权威”，我们拿鎯头锤子的手，也要拿起笔来，和他们展开针锋相对的战斗，把他们打倒。冲锋号吹响了，我们工人阶级要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，站在斗争最前列，彻底打垮一切牛鬼蛇神。
