    According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Public opinion in various countries continues to condemn the serious provocation of US aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace and attacking Chinese aircraft.
    The Albanian newspaper *Zeri i Popullit* published a commentary on the 15th, stating, "The American robbers are playing with fire with the Chinese people and will be buried in flames."
    The commentary pointed out, "Neither blackmail nor provocation can intimidate the great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On the contrary, such actions by the American robbers will further heighten the vigilance of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, further increase their hatred of the aggressors, further enhance their war preparedness, and wage a tit-for-tat struggle against US imperialism." It said, "The US imperialists have already learned that the Chinese People's Liberation Army keeps its word."
    Cambodia's National Radio broadcast a commentary in Phnom Penh on the 14th, stating that the US aircraft shooting down a Chinese aircraft in Chinese territory is an unprecedented new provocation against the People's Republic of China. The commentary said that the direct attack on China exposes Johnson's "peace" platitudes.
    The *Ceylon Observer*, published in Colombo, Ceylon, on the 15th, stated in an editorial: "The high-handed policy pursued by the United States in Asia has created an intolerable situation throughout Asia. The incident itself of the United States aircraft shooting down a Chinese aircraft inside China proves that the provocative actions of the United States in Asia have gone beyond the scope."
    Pakistan's *Leader* stated in an editorial in Karachi on the 14th that the recent intrusion of US aircraft into Chinese airspace is a premeditated aggression by the United States in Southeast Asia. "The whole purpose is to maintain US hegemony in Vietnam and then expand outwards."
    Hirano Yoshitaro, representative member of the Central Executive Committee for the Abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and striving for the realization of various demands, and nine others submitted a protest letter to the US Embassy in Japan on the afternoon of the 14th, strongly condemning the US policy of expanding the war, including expanding the bombing of North Vietnam, invading Laos and Cambodia, and sending five US military aircraft to intrude into Chinese airspace for provocation.
    On the same day, seven representatives of the Japan Democratic Youth League and representatives of the Japanese Communist Party and the Democratic Youth League organizations in Tokyo's Minato Ward also lodged a serious protest with the US Embassy in Japan and demanded that US imperialism get out of Asia and Japan.
    Thirty nurses belonging to the union of the Tokyo Nakano Workers' Medical Association held a demonstration parade on the afternoon of the 14th. Wearing vests with slogans protesting against the US invasion of Vietnam and the intrusion of US aircraft into China, they called on citizens along the way to rise up against US aggression. On the 13th, the union held protest rallies in six locations and sent protest telegrams to the US President.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 16th dispatch from Pathet Lao Radio, broadcasted on the 16th: A spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army issued a statement on the 13th, strongly protesting and condemning the serious incident of US aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace and attacking Chinese aircraft. The statement pointed out that this is another blatant act of war provocation by US imperialism against the great People's Republic of China.
    The statement said that it is clear that while strengthening and expanding the entire Indochina war of aggression, US imperialism is deliberately promoting "escalation," conspiring to invade the People's Republic of China. The statement pointed out that this action by US imperialism is also a resounding slap in the face to the recent rhetoric of the Johnson administration regarding so-called "improving relations with China."
    The statement said that the spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army sternly condemned the above-mentioned rampant war provocation actions of US imperialism. It demands that they immediately stop such actions; otherwise, US imperialism must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.
    The statement said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the 650 million Chinese people will never allow US imperialism to arbitrarily trample on and bully them. We firmly believe that if US imperialism insists on drawing the flames of war to China, China will immediately retaliate. Victory will certainly belong to the Chinese army and the Chinese people.

    阿尔巴尼亚和亚洲各国舆论谴责美机侵犯中国
    美帝国主义必须从亚洲滚出去
    向中国人民玩火必将葬身火海
    老挝人民解放军最高指挥部抗议美帝对中国的新战争挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：各国舆论继续谴责美机侵入中国领空并袭击中国飞机的严重挑衅。
    阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》十五日发表评论说，“美国强盗对中国人民玩火，必将葬身火海”。
    评论指出，“不管是讹诈还是挑衅，都吓不倒伟大的中国人民和中国人民解放军。相反，美国强盗的这类行动必将进一步更加提高中国人民和中国人民解放军的警惕性，必将进一步提高他们对侵略者的仇恨，进一步提高他们的战备并且和美帝国主义作针锋相对的斗争。”它说，“美帝国主义者已经领教过中国人民解放军是说话算数的。”
    柬埔寨国家电台十四日在金边发表评论说，美国飞机在中国领土上空击落一架中国飞机，是对中华人民共和国史无前例的新的挑衅。评论说，对中国的直接攻击拆穿了约翰逊的“和平”滥调。
    在锡兰科伦坡出版的《锡兰之光报》十五日发表的社论说：“美国在亚洲奉行的蛮横无理的政策，在整个亚洲造成了难以容忍的局面。美国飞机在中国境内击落中国飞机，这个事件本身证明，美国在亚洲的挑衅行动已经超出了范围。”
    巴基斯坦《领袖报》十四日在卡拉奇发表社论指出，美国飞机最近侵入中国领空，是美国在东南亚的一次预谋的侵略。“整个目的是要维持美国在越南的霸权，然后向四外扩张。”
    废除日美“安全条约”争取实现各种要求中央执行委员会代表委员平野义太郎等十人，十四日下午把一份抗议书递交美国驻日本大使馆，强烈谴责美国扩大对越南北方的轰炸、侵略老挝与侵犯柬埔寨以及派遣五架美军飞机侵入中国领空进行挑衅等扩大战争的政策。
    同一天，日本民主青年同盟的七位代表以及东京港区的日本共产党和民主青年同盟组织的代表，也向美国驻日本大使馆提出了严重抗议，并且要求美帝国主义从亚洲以及日本滚出去。
    东京中野勤劳者医疗协议会工会所属的三十名护士，十四日下午举行了游行示威。她们身穿写有抗议美国侵越和美机侵入中国等口号的坎肩，在沿途呼吁市民起来反对美国的侵略行为。十三日，这个工会曾经在六个地方举行了抗议集会，并且向美国总统发出了抗议电报。
    据新华社康开十六日电　据巴特寮电台十六日广播：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人十三日发表声明，强烈抗议和谴责美国飞机侵犯中国领空和袭击中国飞机的严重事件。声明指出，这是美帝国主义对伟大的中华人民共和国进行的又一明目张胆的战争挑衅行动。
    声明说，很显然，美帝国主义在强化和扩大整个印度支那侵略战争的同时，正在蓄意促进“升级”，阴谋进犯中华人民共和国。声明指出，美帝国主义这一行动也是对约翰逊政府最近叫嚷的所谓“改善同中国的关系”的论调打了一记响亮的耳光。
    声明说，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人严厉谴责美帝国主义的上述猖狂的战争挑衅行动。要求它们必须立即停止这种行动，否则，美帝国主义必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
    声明说，中国人民解放军和六亿五千万中国人民是绝不允许美帝国主义任意蹂躏和欺负的。我们坚信，如果美帝国主义一定要把战火引到中国，中国必将立即给予回击。胜利肯定是属于中国军队和中国人民的。
