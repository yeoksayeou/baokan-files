    Overseas Chinese Returning Home Love the Party
    We tell you, Deng Tuo, you want us to go backwards, it's absolutely impossible, we Overseas Chinese returning home resolutely disagree.
    Zhou Quangen, Delegate to the National People's Congress, Returned Overseas Chinese Worker from Indonesia, State-Run Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm

    Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist black elements are in cahoots with domestic and foreign monsters and demons, venomously cursing our Party for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses," gnashing their teeth and cursing our Party for being "hegemonistic," and arrogantly clamoring for our Party to step down and "rest." We returned Overseas Chinese at the farm became more and more angry the more we listened to these flies buzzing. We tell you, Deng Tuo, we can see clearly your black heart in attacking our Party in an organized and planned way.

    I was born into a poor family and worked as a coolie in Shanghai from a young age. Later, in order to squeeze more money out of me, the capitalists sold me to Hong Kong to work as a miner. The Hong Kong capitalists were even more ruthless and sold me as a "piglet" to Indonesia. In Indonesia, I lived under someone else's roof, never had enough to eat or wear, and the landlords and capitalists often beat me half to death. I swallowed my tears and endured this hardship for over thirty years. When the motherland was liberated and the red sun rose in the East, we Overseas Chinese had a strong backing. I was extremely happy. Soon after, I returned to the embrace of the motherland empty-handed with my family. The Party and Chairman Mao were truly kind to us, and quickly made proper arrangements. In 1954, we were allowed to settle down at the Xinglong Farm. Life at Xinglong Farm is truly thriving. I have never had such a good life as I have today. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the political status of us returned Overseas Chinese has been elevated to an unprecedented level. In 1964, I was elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress. In Beijing, I met our beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao and many central leaders sat with us, discussing state affairs and letting us be masters of our own affairs. A person like me, who was sold as a "piglet" in the old society, can now attend meetings with Chairman Mao. Isn't this proof that the Party trusts us and looks up to us? Among the delegates to the National People's Congress, how many delegates are there like me? Deng Tuo, we returned Overseas Chinese have boundless love for the Party. The more you, a small handful of black elements, curse the Party, the more we love the Party.

    Our Party and Chairman Mao have always relied on the masses and followed the mass line in leading the revolution. The successive victories of the revolutionary cause were won by relying on the masses. Take our farm as an example. The farm consults with the masses on everything it does and relies on everyone to do it. In order to develop tropical cash crops, the Party committee hired me and several old farmers to participate in the Scientific Research Committee, implementing the three-way combination of leaders, technicians, and old farmers. Our farm workers work together with one heart and one mind. Now, a barren mountain has been transformed into a tropical crop garden. Deng Tuo, you curse our Party for "looking down on the masses," and vainly attempt to sow discord between the Party and the masses. This is absolutely impossible. We returned Overseas Chinese resolutely disagree. Whoever wants us to go backwards, we will resolutely fight them until they are bloody.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "If you don't hit reactionary things, they won't fall." We must fight you, this small handful of harmful insects, to the end. Whether you are the big boss, or some small clerk, or even some chairman of the board, we will completely overthrow all monsters and demons, and leave not even half of them!

    归国华侨热爱党
    告诉你，邓拓，你们想让我们走回头路，这绝对办不到，我们归国华侨坚决不答应
    全国人民代表大会代表国营兴隆华侨农场印尼归侨工人  周全根
    邓拓一伙反党反社会主义黑帮和国内外牛鬼蛇神穿一条裤子，一个鼻孔出气，恶毒地咒骂我们的党“自作聪明，看不起群众”，咬牙切齿地骂我们党“霸道”，狂妄地叫嚷要我们党赶快下台“休息”。我们场的归国华侨听到这几头苍蝇嗡嗡叫，越听越生气。告诉你，邓拓，你们有组织有计划地攻击我们党的黑心，我们是看得清清楚楚的。
    我出身在一个贫苦的家庭，从小就在上海作苦工，后来，资本家为从我身上榨更多的钱，把我卖给香港作矿工，香港的资本家心更狠，又把我当“猪仔”出卖，运到印度尼西亚去。在印度尼西亚，我寄人篱下，吃不饱，穿不暖，地主资本家还常把我打得死去活来。就这样，泪水往肚里流，苦熬了三十多年。祖国解放了，东方升起了红太阳，我们华侨才有了强大的靠山，我高兴极了，没多久，我就带着一家人两手空空地回到了祖国的怀抱。党和毛主席对我们真是恩深如海，很快就作了妥善安排，一九五四年又让我们到兴隆农场来落户。兴隆农场日子过得真兴隆，我从来没有过过象今天这样的好生活。在党和毛主席的领导下，我们归国华侨的政治地位空前提高。一九六四年，我被选为全国人民代表大会代表，在北京，我见过我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席和中央许多首长跟我们坐在一起，议论国家大事，让我们当家作主。象我这样在旧社会被当作“猪仔”出卖的人，现在能和毛主席一起开会，这不是党很信任我们，看得起我们的证明吗？在全国人民代表大会的代表中，象我这样的代表，不知道有多少？邓拓，我们归国华侨对党有无限的热爱，你们一小撮黑帮越骂党，我们就越热爱党。
    我们党和毛主席领导革命，向来都是依靠群众，走群众路线的，革命事业一个接一个的胜利，就是依靠群众夺来的。就拿我们农场来说吧，场里无论办哪一件事都要和群众商量，靠大家来办。场里发展热带经济作物，党委聘请我和几位老农参加科学研究委员会，实行领导、技术员、老农三结合。我们场职工齐心协力干。现在，一片荒山已经变成了热带作物园。邓拓，你骂我们党“看不起群众”，妄想挑拨党和群众的关系，这绝对办不到。我们归国华侨坚决不答应，无论是谁，要让我们走回头路，我们坚决打他个头破血流。
    毛主席教导我们：“反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们要和你们这一小撮害人虫斗到底，不管是你这个大掌柜，还是什么小伙计，甚至什么董事长，凡是牛鬼蛇神，我们一律要彻底打倒，半个也不留！
