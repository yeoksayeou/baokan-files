    Exposing Wu Han's Counter-Revolutionary True Colors
    —Investigative Materials from Wudian Commune, Yiwu County, Wu Han's Hometown
    Qi Li, Meng Jin
    What kind of stuff is Wu Han, this vanguard of the "Three-Family Village" black shop? Recently, we conducted an investigation in his hometown—Kututang Brigade of Wudian Commune in Yiwu County and the nearby Democratic, Liberation, Peace, and Victory Brigades, and Fucun and Yiting Communes. A large number of facts revealed by the local poor and lower-middle peasants, and a batch of incriminating evidence we collected, punctured the various lies carefully fabricated by Wu Han for many years and fully exposed Wu Han's counter-revolutionary true colors.
  (I) Fabricating a progressive family history, concealing two generations
        of counter-revolutionary crimes, covering up the landlord family's
        reactionary essence, and engaging in political opportunism
    In February 1950, Wu Han published an article, "I Overcame the 'Super-Class' Viewpoint," fabricating a "progressive" and "glorious" family history for himself, attempting to deceive the masses and cover up his counter-revolutionary face. Now, let's take a look at the truth of the facts!
      (1) Grandfather was a butcher who suppressed the Taiping Army
    Wu Han said: His "grandfather was a tenant farmer." Was he really a tenant farmer?
    Please see Wu Han's father, Wu Binjue, in the "Jiaoshan Wu Clan Genealogy," giving Wu Han's grandfather, Wu Maohuan, the "Biography of the Honorable Father":
      "The Honorable Father was a Dengshilang, with the given name Maohuan. Throughout his life, he rarely smiled and valued promises. Filial piety, brotherly love, and kindness came naturally to him. He was able to adapt to circumstances. He had great aspirations. Because he was limited by circumstances, he was unable to study the classics, which he always regretted. In the eleventh year of Xianfeng, the Hong and Yang branches attacked Jinhua,... In the autumn of that year, large groups of bandits disturbed the territory, and the surrounding villages formed volunteer groups in Kushan. On July 13th, they fought the bandits. The Honorable Father bravely took the lead, chasing them twenty miles to the Donghe border." (Note: The punctuation in the quote was added by the investigators, the same below.)
      "Previously, the Honorable Father and the late paternal uncle jointly invested some funds to trade money lending, using the funds for the ancestors' sacrificial rites. After the late paternal uncle passed away, the Honorable Father managed it alone, unknown to the nephews."
    It turns out that Wu Han's grandfather, Wu Maohuan, was not a "tenant farmer" at all, but a "Dengshilang"—a ninth-rank official of the feudal dynasty, a butcher who "bravely took the lead" in slaughtering and suppressing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolutionary army, and a usurer who "traded money lending."
      (2) Father was a reactionary police officer
    Wu Han said: His "father went to Hangzhou to attend school" and "worked as a civil servant after graduation." What kind of "school" did his father attend? What kind of "civil servant" did he work as?
    Please see his father's own account in the "Biography of the Honorable Father":
      "Graduated from the Zhejiang Advanced Police Academy as a student of the county school, and served as a police assistant in Shipu, Daishan, Fengxia, and Yushan towns in Xiangshan."
    The "Jiaoshan Wu Clan Genealogy" also has a record of this "civil servant":
    "Line Bin 2174, given name Binjue, style name Wenzhai, alias Yunhe, listed name Sheng, Bangxiangsheng, graduated from the Zhejiang Advanced Police Academy, and served as a police officer in Xiangshan, Dinghai, Jiangshan, Dongyang, and other counties."
    It can be seen that Wu Han's father, Wu Binjue, was not a "civil servant" at all, but a reactionary police officer, a loyal lackey of the reactionary ruling class, and a fierce enemy of the working people.
    Wu Han said: After his father, Wu Binjue, was "unemployed," he was very resentful, drank all day, and did not care about anything.
    According to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Kututang Brigade, Wu Binjue lost his "black gauze hat" as a police officer due to "dog-eat-dog" infighting within the reactionary ruling group. After returning to his hometown, he became a local evil force, doing evil and dominating the area. All the big and small things in the village had to be decided by him. Poor families had to invite him to drink at weddings and funerals. If the meat was not cooked well, he would scold people with his "stick." Local tyrants, landlords, and rich peasants often came to visit him. At times, eight or nine sedan chairs would be carried into his house in a single day. The police of the local reactionary police station were like his doormen. As long as Wu Binjue gave them a note, they would do whatever he said immediately. The masses said: Wu Binjue was a notorious local scoundrel.
      (3) Mother was a landlord woman who was hostile to the Communist Party
    Wu Han said: His "mother was the daughter of a middle peasant." In his article "Record of the Eighth Detachment," Wu Han portrayed his mother, Jiang Sanying, as a "good person" who "sympathized" with the revolution and "praised" the revolutionary troops.
    According to local poor and lower-middle peasants: From 1943 to 1944, the Eighth Detachment of our Jin-Xiao Column carried out "two-five" rent reduction in the base area according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee. At that time, Wu Bihui (a Communist Party member), a tenant farmer of the Wu family, took the lead in asking the landlord woman, Jiang Sanying, to reduce rent. The landlord woman said fiercely: "If you want to reduce rent, I will take back the land!" Wu Bihui complained to the Xikou Democratic Government, and the landlord woman went to Xikou twice by sedan chair to resist frantically and refused to reduce rent. Later, she was forced to reduce the rent because the Democratic Government made a judgment.
    According to the family members of revolutionary cadres such as Fu Zhiying: The landlord woman, Jiang Sanying, also often cursed the Eighth Detachment of the Jin-Xiao Column as "bandits" and "maggots," and cursed the family members of the Eighth Detachment's cadres as "bandit mothers" and "bandit wives." In 1945, when the main force of the Eighth Detachment withdrew north, the landlord woman, Jiang Sanying, became even more arrogant and cursed the Eighth Detachment, saying: "Heaven has eyes, these maggots have flown away."
    It can be seen that Wu Han's mother, Jiang Sanying, was not a "good person" who "sympathized" with the revolution at all, but a landlord woman who hated the revolutionary army and was irreconcilable with the Communist Party.
      (4) The truth about "building a family through hard work"
    Wu Han said: His family "relied on a large labor force," "lived frugally," "saved every penny," and "built a family through hard work." He also said that he was a "poor man," a "poor student," and that his family was "poor" in his early years, with his mother and him eating "a penny's worth of tofu for a day, washing and reheating leftover rice, and his mother still shed tears when she mentioned these days in her later years."
    Is this really the case?
    According to investigations, from Wu Han's childhood until liberation, his family had 42.5 mu of land, 12 buildings, and employed two to three long-term workers and maids all year round. During busy times, they also hired a large number of short-term workers, with a net income of 7,000 to 8,000 jin of grain per year. At the same time, they also partnered with others to open a Jicheng Jingnan goods store in Wudian, employing seven shop assistants. They were the richest family among the 100-plus households in Kututang Village. According to poor peasants Chen Jin'e, Gong Yinmei, and Bao Huaying, who had worked as hired laborers in his house, Wu Han's family had a lot of ham and a lot of stale grain. His mother drank alcohol every day, and his father was addicted to eating "red pills." The family lived a luxurious life of "meat rotting behind the vermillion gates." Wu Han himself hated labor since he was a child and could not distinguish between scallions and wheat. When he went to Jinhua to study, he went by sedan chair and returned on horseback. He drank alcohol and gambled, living the life of a dissolute young master. During the investigation, we read Wu Han's fabricated lies about "eating leftover rice" to the local poor and lower-middle peasants. The local poor and lower-middle peasants said angrily: "The landlord master and the police officer's wife could not finish all their wine and meat, how could they eat leftover rice? It's nonsense!"
    Where did Wu Han's family's luxurious living conditions come from? The poor and lower-middle peasants of Kututang Brigade revealed: Wu Han's family did not work. Most of his family's fields, houses, and shops were acquired during the short six or seven years when his father was a reactionary police officer, using the people's hard-earned money. Relying on this sinful family property, the Wu family more cruelly exploited the peasants, and the family lived a luxurious life. One year, the poor peasant Zhu Haiying rented land from Wu Han's family. The landlord woman, Jiang Sanying, rented her a plot of 2.25 mu of land but insisted on calculating the rent as 2.5 mu, requiring her to pay 700 jin of grain every year. After Zhu Haiying rented the land, the best harvest was only 800 to 900 jin. Almost all the grain harvested every year went into the Wu family's granary, and she had to eat bean and wheat bran porridge to survive. Every year, when the crops were not yet ripe, she had to borrow grain from the Wu family. She borrowed 100 jin at the end of the year and had to repay 150 jin when the new grain came on the market. The poor peasant Gong Yinmei and her daughter worked as maids in the Wu family because they were forced by life. The daughter, Chen Jin'e, worked like an animal in the Wu family, getting up before dawn and going to bed late at night, for six years without receiving a penny of wages. Because Chen Jin'e could not stand this inhuman abuse, she escaped back home. The landlord woman, Jiang Sanying, went to the Chen family and forced Jin'e to return to the Wu family. When Jin'e refused, Jiang Sanying even stripped off Chen Jin'e's cotton coat and trousers. It is because of this that the local poor and lower-middle peasants deeply hated the Wu family landlords. They said: "Every inch of land, every brick, and every tile of the Wu family is permeated with the blood and tears of our working people. If they hadn't died before the land reform, we would have struggled against them."
    So far, the "progressive" family history carefully fabricated by Wu Han has been revealed! It turns out that he is not the grandson of a "tenant farmer" or the son of a "civil servant," but the grandson of a butcher who slaughtered and suppressed the Taiping Army, and the son of a reactionary police officer. He himself is not a "poor man" or a "poor student," but a thoroughbred landlord's young master who grew up on the blood and sweat of the working people. Wu Han's family history is not a "progressive" family history, but a counter-revolutionary history of crimes! A history of exploitation by the landlord class!
      (5) A counter-revolutionary political conspiracy
    Why did Wu Han choose 1950, not sooner or later, shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, to play tricks, fabricate a progressive family history, and cover up the reactionary essence of the landlord family? In this regard, Wu Han has a confession in his article "I Overcame the 'Super-Class' Viewpoint." He said:
      "Because of the difficulties of my family in my childhood, I naturally disliked the wealthy landlords in the countryside and sympathized with the peasants," "I had unlimited concern and longing for the peasant revolution."
    It turns out that Wu Han's purpose in creating something out of nothing and racking his brains to fabricate a family history was not for anything else, but to plant a "progressive" class origin on his "rebellious bone," so that people would believe that he was "naturally" a person who "belonged to the proletariat or at least should follow the proletariat," so that he could more unscrupulously attack the Party under the cover of a "progressive" face.
    This is a shameful lie and a vicious political conspiracy!
  (II) Adhering to the reactionary stance, whitewashing the landlords, rich
        peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists,
        calling for redress, undermining various revolutionary
        movements, and consistently being an enemy of the people
    For a long time, Wu Han has repeatedly declared that his class stance is "firmly established." In 1950, he reiterated this point. In 1961, he reiterated this point again. Until last December, after the two anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," were exposed and criticized, he still quibbled: "For more than 20 years," "my political class stance has been firmly established."
    Then, what class "stance" has Wu Han "firmly established"? Let's take a look at what Wu Han has done in his hometown in the 16 years since liberation!
          (1) Playing double-dealing tricks, undermining
      land reform
    In 1950, on the eve of the land reform movement, Wu Han, on the one hand, threw out the article "I Overcame the 'Super-Class' Viewpoint," publicly proclaiming that his family was "built through hard work," and on the other hand, appeared as a "progressive person" who "supported land reform," writing to the Yiwu County People's Government, saying:
      "All my houses, fields, and furniture are all dedicated to the government..."
    Wu Han attempted to paralyze the revolutionary will of the masses and escape the struggle of the masses by means of "dedicating" fields and "dedicating" houses. The local masses saw through Wu Han's tricks. They said: "The landlord's land was all exploited from our working people. Now it is the return of land to its original owners. Why do you landlords need to show such concern!" According to the Party's policy, they classified Wu Han's family as landlord class, and Wu Han's conspiracy to "dedicate land" did not succeed. In the winter of 1952, just as the land reform struggle in this province achieved a great victory and the poor and lower-middle peasants were elated, Wu Han directed a disgraceful farce of extensively repairing the graves of his landlord parents. He entrusted people to buy a large tombstone from other places, and specially invited a celebrity from Beijing to inscribe the tombstone, customized a batch of tomb bricks with his father's name, and extensively built a large tomb. It goes without saying that this was a reactionary activity to greatly increase the prestige of the landlord class and frantically counterattack the land reform movement.
          (2) Acting as a spokesman for rich peasant elements,
    attacking the policy of unified purchase and marketing
    In 1954, the rural areas of this province implemented a unified purchase and marketing of grain, which was a major measure for socialist transformation. This measure dealt a heavy blow to the capitalist forces and was enthusiastically supported by the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, but it also aroused resistance from a small handful of landlords and rich peasants. It was at this important moment of the struggle between these two roads that Wu Chongyang's son, a rich peasant element from Wudian Commune, went to see Wu Han. As soon as they met, Wu Han asked point-blank: "Are you a Party member?" with a rather wary intention. Later, when Wu Han realized from the conversation that the father and son had dissatisfaction with the policy of unified purchase and marketing of grain, Wu Han said happily: "I have no son and I like young people very much. Come and play often in the future." And he instructed Wu Chongyang's son to find a "reliable person" in his hometown to "write a detailed investigation report" for him. He said: "I want to report this situation to the central leadership." Wu Han attempted to use this as "artillery shells," using "reporting the situation" as an excuse to attack the Party Central Committee and the Party's policy of unified purchase and marketing.
          (3) Reversing verdicts for counter-revolutionary elements,
    opposing the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement
    In 1956, just as our country's struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements achieved a major victory, Wu Han could not wait to stand up and call "injustice" for the counter-revolutionary element Yang Zulin, using his authority to actively reverse the verdict for the counter-revolutionary element Yang Zulin. Yang Zulin was a company commander in the Chiang bandit army. Before liberation, under the command of Liao Ken, the pseudo-Wenzhou defense commander and murderous devil, he led bandit troops to Pingyang to suppress the "Big Sword Society" peasant army, burning, killing, and looting along the way. He was a butcher with blood debts. After liberation, Yang Zulin concealed his counter-revolutionary identity and sneaked into Wudian Central Primary School in Yiwu County as a teacher. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries struggle, the masses exposed his counter-revolutionary crimes and removed him from the ranks of the people's teachers. This was completely necessary, correct, and in line with the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. However, Wu Han, as the deputy mayor of Beijing, was greatly dissatisfied with this fair handling by the people. After receiving the letter from the counter-revolutionary element Yang Zulin slandering the suppression of counter-revolutionaries struggle and shouting "injustice," Wu Han wrote a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, loudly shouting "injustice" for the counter-revolutionary element, asking the local government to "redress" and "reverse the verdict" for the counter-revolutionary element. At the same time, he personally wrote a "letter of condolence" to Yang Zulin. The original text is as follows:
       "Langzhi, Jiaqi, Brother Zulin:
    The letter has been received. It has been forwarded to the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee for investigation and handling.
    I believe that the truth will come to light and a proper solution will be found.
        With respect.
                        Wu Han, August 29th"
    What a "Brother Zulin"! What a "the truth will come to light and a proper solution will be found"! See, Wu Han is calling the counter-revolutionary element Yang Zulin brother, how intimate! See, Wu Han is cheering up the counter-revolutionary element Yang Zulin how vigorously! However, because Yang Zulin's counter-revolutionary crimes were irrefutable, Wu Han's conspiracy to reverse the verdict for the counter-revolutionary element did not succeed. However, his reactionary behavior greatly boosted Yang Zulin's counter-revolutionary arrogance. Yang Zulin, relying on Wu Han as his "big backer," frantically counterattacked the Party, the People's Government, and the local masses. He openly cursed the cadres, posted reactionary slogans, and attacked our Party's theory of class struggle. He said that "the Communist Party's theory of class struggle is always the living coffin of the four categories of elements." Because this counter-revolutionary element refused to submit to control, he was resolutely struggled against by the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants.
      (4) Inciting demons and monsters to attack the Party
    In June and July 1959, on the eve of the Lushan Conference, just as the right-leaning opportunist elements were frantically attacking the Party, Wu Han, on the one hand, threw out poisonous weeds such as "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" to beat the drums and cheer for the right-leaning opportunist elements; on the other hand, he threw out "Collection of Javelins," whitewashing the local big landlord Yang Dejian and the rightist element Ji Hongye in the "Record of the Eighth Detachment" this "Returning Home Prose," praising Yang Dejian as "shrewd," "honest," "generous," "liking friends," and understanding "the principle of resisting Japan and saving the country," and so on. He blatantly tampered with history and "conferred" the big landlords and rightist elements as "heroes" who "founded" the Eighth Detachment of the Jin-Xiao Column. Not only that, Wu Han also nonsensically said that the Eighth Detachment of the Jin-Xiao Column organized under the leadership of our Party was "an anti-Japanese self-defense armed force automatically organized by enlightened landlords and the people," singing praises for the landlord class, openly inciting demons and monsters, and cooperating with the right-leaning opportunist elements to attack the Party.
    In 1962, just as the rural areas of this province encountered temporary difficulties due to years of natural disasters, Wu Han once again stood up and continued to incite the four categories of elements to attack the Party. That winter, the counter-revolutionary element Bao Wenda from Yiting Commune in Yiwu and the renegade Fu Zhangfeng from Fucun Commune in Jinhua wrote letters to Wu Han, viciously attacking the People's Commune and attacking the Party's policies, and both immediately received Wu Han's "deep sympathy" and "care." He, in the guise of a "senior leader," wrote directly to the Party committees of Yiting and Fucun Communes, asking them to meet the various "demands" put forward by the counter-revolutionary elements and renegades.
    Chairman Mao taught us that whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Although Wu Han has repeatedly claimed that his "political class stance is firmly established," his own actions in the 16 years since liberation have just shattered his own nonsense and exposed his true colors. It turns out that what he has "firmly established" is not the class stance of the proletariat at all, but consistently and stubbornly standing on the stance of the landlords and the bourgeoisie; he is not a revolutionary, but a counter-revolutionary who has consistently been an enemy of the people, a conspirator who is carrying out capitalist and feudal restoration! A veteran anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary. We must recognize his counter-revolutionary essence, thoroughly expose his counter-revolutionary conspiracy! Tear off his disguise and thoroughly smash him together with the "Three-Family Village"!

    揭露吴晗的反革命真面目
    ——吴晗家乡义乌县吴店公社调查材料
    齐力　孟进
    吴晗这个“三家村”黑店的急先锋，究竟是个什么货色？最近，我们到他的家乡——义乌县吴店公社苦竹塘大队和附近的民主、解放、和平、胜利等大队，傅村、义亭等公社，进行了一次调查。当地贫下中农揭露的大量事实，和我们搜集到的一批罪证，戳破了吴晗多年来苦心编造的种种谎话，充分暴露了吴晗的反革命真面目。
  （一）伪造进步家史，隐瞒两代
        反革命罪恶，掩盖地主家
        庭反动本质，进行政治投
        机
    一九五○年二月，吴晗发表了一篇文章：《我克服了“超阶级”观点》，为自己编造了一部“进步”的、“光荣”的家史，妄图蒙骗群众，掩盖他的反革命面目。现在，我们就来看看事实的真相是怎样的吧！
      （一）祖父是镇压太平军的刽子手
    吴晗说：他的“祖父是佃农”。真的是佃农吗？
    请看吴晗的父亲吴瑸珏在《椒山吴氏宗谱》中，给吴晗的祖父吴懋环作的《府君行述》：
      “府君登仕郎，讳懋环。生平寡言笑，重然诺。孝友慈爱，出自性成。虑事能达权变。宅志阔大。因困于境遇。未克执经，常以为生平恨。咸丰十一年，洪、杨支党陷金华，……是年秋，匪党大股扰境，附近各村落，相聚义勇团于苦山。七月十三日，与匪开仗。府君奋勇当先，追击二十里至东河界。”（注：引文中的标点是调查者加的，下同。）
      “先是府君与先伯父合资若干，权贸子母，资为先人祀典。先伯父逝世，府君独手经营，子侄辈不知也。”
    原来，吴晗的祖父吴懋环，并不是什么“佃农”，而是一个“登仕郎”——封建王朝的九品官，一个“奋勇当先”屠杀和镇压太平天国农民革命军的刽子手，一个“权贸子母”的高利贷者。
      （二）父亲是反动警察官
    吴晗说：他“父亲到杭州去进学校”，“毕业后一直作公务员”。他父亲进的是什么“学校”？作的是什么“公务员”？
    请看他父亲在《府君行述》中的自白：
      “以邑庠生毕业于浙江高等巡警学堂，历任象山石浦、岱山、凤峡、玉山各镇警佐。”
    《椒山吴氏宗谱》还有一段关于这位“公务员”的记载：
    “行瑸二千一百七十四讳瑸珏，字闻斋，号云鹤，榜名声，邦庠生，全浙高等巡警学堂毕业，历任象山、定海、江山、东阳等县警察官。”
    可见，吴晗的父亲吴瑸珏，并不是什么“公务员”，而是一个反动警察官，一个反动统治阶级的忠实爪牙，劳动人民的凶狠敌人。
    吴晗说：他父亲吴瑸珏“失业”以后，很牢骚，成天喝酒，闲事勿管了。
    据苦竹塘大队贫下中农揭露：吴瑸珏由于反动统治集团内部“狗咬狗”的原因，丢掉了警察官的“乌纱帽”，回乡以后，又成了地方上的恶势力，为非作歹，称霸一方。村里大小事情，要由他说了算。穷人家碰到红白喜事，非要请他吃酒不可。肉烧得不好，他还要笃着“斯的克”（即手杖）骂人。地方上的土豪劣绅和地主富农，常来他家拜访。多的时候，一天就有八九顶轿子抬进他家的大门。当地反动警察所的警察，好比他家的看门狗，只要吴瑸珏一个条子，什么事都马上照办。群众说：吴瑸珏是当地一个出名的恶棍。
      （三）母亲是敌视共产党的地主婆
    吴晗说：他的“母亲是中农的女儿”。吴晗在《记第八大队》一文中，把他的母亲蒋三英描绘成为一个“同情”革命、“赞扬”革命部队的“好人”。
    据当地贫下中农揭露：一九四三年到一九四四年，我金萧支队第八大队根据党中央的指示，在根据地进行“二五”减租。当时，吴家佃户吴璧辉（共产党员）带头要地主婆蒋三英减租，地主婆恶狠狠地说：“你要减租，我就收田！”吴璧辉向溪口民主政府控告，地主婆又先后两次乘轿去溪口，疯狂顽抗，拒不减租。后来，因民主政府作出判决，才被迫减了租。
    又据傅芝英等革命干部家属揭露：地主婆蒋三英还经常咒骂金萧支队第八大队是“土匪”，是“蛆虫”，咒骂八大队的干部家属是“土匪娘”、“土匪婆”。一九四五年，第八大队主力北撤，地主婆蒋三英气焰更加嚣张，咒骂第八大队说：“老天爷有眼睛，这批蛆虫飞走了。”
    由此可见，吴晗的母亲蒋三英，根本不是一个“同情”革命的“好人”，而是一个仇视革命军队、与共产党誓不两立的地主婆。
      （四）“勤苦成家”的真相
    吴晗说：他们一家人是“靠着人力多”、“节衣缩食”、“省吃俭用”、“勤苦成家”的。他还说什么他是“穷人”，“穷学生”，早年家境“困难”，母子三人“一个钱豆腐吃一天，馊饭洗了再热了吃，母亲晚年提到这些日子还流泪。”
    情况果真是这样的吗？
    经调查，他的家，从吴晗少年时起，直到解放，有田地四十二亩半，楼屋十二间，常年雇用长工和女佣人两人至三人，忙时还大量雇用短工，每年净收租谷七、八千斤，同时还与人合伙，在吴店开办过一爿雇有七个伙计的集成京南货店，是苦竹塘村一百几十户人家的首富。据在他家当过雇工的贫农陈金娥、龚银妹和鲍华英等人揭露：吴晗家中，火腿多，陈粮多，他母亲天天喝酒，父亲嗜吃“红丸”，一家人过的是“朱门酒肉臭”的奢侈生活。吴晗本人，也从小厌恶劳动，葱麦不分；到金华读书，是乘轿而去，骑马而归；喝酒、赌博，过去是浪荡公子的生活。在调查过程中，我们给当地贫下中农读了吴晗编造的“吃馊饭”等谎话，当地贫下中农气愤地说：“地主老爷，警官太太，酒肉都吃不光，哪里还会吃什么馊饭，真是胡说八道！”
    吴晗一家的这种奢侈的生活条件哪里来？苦竹塘大队贫下中农揭露：吴晗一家人都不劳动，他家的田产、房屋、店铺，大都是在他父亲当反动警察官的短短六、七年时间内，用搜刮来的民脂民膏弄起来的。依靠这份罪恶的家当，吴家便更加残酷地剥削农民，一家人过着奢侈的生活。有一年，贫农朱海英向吴晗家租田，地主婆蒋三英将一丘二亩二分五的田租给她，却一定要按二亩半计租，每年要交租谷七百斤。朱海英租得田后，最好的年景收成也不过八九百斤。每年打下的粮食，几乎全都倒进了吴家的谷仓，自己只好吃豆麦糠菜糊口。每年青黄不接的时候，又得向吴家去借粮。年底借一百斤，新谷登场时要还一百五十斤。贫农龚银妹母女两人，因生活所迫，到吴家当女佣人。女儿陈金娥，在吴家，起三更，落半夜，做了六年牛马，没有拿到一分钱的工资。陈金娥因受不了这种非人的虐待，逃回家去。地主婆蒋三英便赶到陈家，硬逼金娥回吴家。金娥不从，蒋三英竟剥走了陈金娥的棉衣和单裤。正是因为这样，当地贫下中农对吴家地主深恶痛绝。他们说：“吴家的每一寸土地，每一块砖、每一片瓦，都渗透着我们劳动人民的血和泪。要不是他们在土改前死掉，非斗争他们不可。”
    至此，吴晗苦心编造的“进步”家史，真相大白！原来，他不是什么“佃农”的孙子，“公务员”的儿子，而是屠杀和镇压太平军的刽子手的孙子，反动警察官的儿子。他自己也不是什么“穷人”、“穷学生”，而是一个喝劳动人民血汗长大的地地道道的地主大少爷。吴晗的家史，不是什么“进步”家史，而是一部反革命的罪恶史！地主阶级的剥削史！
      （五）一个反革命政治阴谋
    吴晗为什么不迟不早地选择中华人民共和国刚成立不久的一九五○年耍弄花招伪造进步家史、掩盖地主家庭的反动本质呢？对此，吴晗在《我克服了“超阶级”观点》一文中，有一段自白。他说：
      “由于幼年时家境的困难，我自然地对农村中生活富裕的大地主不满意，对农民同情”，“对农民革命则寄予无限的关切和向往”。
    原来，吴晗无中生有，挖空心思伪造家史的目的，不是为了别的，而是为了在他的“反骨”上栽上一条“进步”的阶级根源，从而使人们相信，他是“自然地”成为“无产阶级或者至少应该跟着无产阶级走了”的人，以便他在“进步”面目的掩护下，更加肆无忌惮地向党猖狂进攻。
    这是一个可耻的谎言，恶毒的政治阴谋！
  （二）坚持反动立场，为地富反
        坏右分子涂脂抹粉，喊冤
        叫屈，破坏各项革命运
        动，一贯与人民为敌
    长期以来，吴晗一再宣称：他的阶级立场是“站稳了的”。一九五○年，他重申过这一点。一九六一年，他又重申这一点。直到去年十二月《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》这两株反党反社会主义大毒草受到了揭露和批判以后，他仍然狡辩：“二十多年来”“政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的”。
    那么，吴晗“站稳了的”究竟是什么阶级的“立场”呢？请看解放十六年来吴晗在家乡的所作所为吧！
          （一）耍弄两面手法，破坏
      土地改革
    一九五○年，土地改革运动开展前夕，吴晗一面抛出《我克服了“超阶级”观点》这篇文章，公开宣扬他家是“勤苦成家”的，一面又以“拥护土改”的“进步人士”面目出现，给义乌县人民政府写信说：
      “我的房子、田地和家具一切，全部献给政府……。”
    吴晗妄图用“献”田、“献”屋的手段，麻痹群众的革命斗志，逃避群众斗争。当地群众识破了吴晗的诡计。他们说：“地主的土地，都是从我们劳动人民手上剥削去的，如今是土地还老家，哪要你地主献殷勤！”他们根据党的政策，把吴晗的家庭划为地主成份，吴晗的“献田”阴谋没有得逞。一九五二年冬天，正当本省土地改革斗争取得伟大胜利，贫下中农扬眉吐气的时候，吴晗又别有用心地导演了一场为地主父母大修坟墓的丑剧。他托人从外地买回一块大坟碑，又特地请北京一位名人给坟碑题了字，定制了一批有他父亲名字的坟砖，大事张罗，修起了一个大坟头。不言而喻，这是为地主阶级大长威风、对土地改革运动疯狂反扑的反动活动。
          （二）作富农分子代言人，
    攻击统购统销政策
    一九五四年，本省农村实行粮食统购统销，这是社会主义改造的一项重大措施。这一措施，给了资本主义势力以沉重的打击，受到了广大贫下中农的热烈拥护，但是，也引起了一小撮地富分子的反抗。正是在这两条道路斗争的重要时刻，吴店公社富农分子吴重阳的儿子去找吴晗。一见面，吴晗劈头就问：“你是不是党员？”颇有戒备之意。后来，当吴晗从谈话中发觉对方父子两人对粮食统购统销政策怀有不满情绪时，吴晗便高兴地说：“我没有儿子，非常喜欢青年人，以后常来玩。”并且指使吴重阳的儿子设法在家乡找一个“可靠的人”，给他“写一个详细的调查材料”。他说：“我要把这个情况反映给中央领导。”吴晗妄图以此为“炮弹”，以“反映情况”为借口，攻击党中央，攻击党的统购统销政策。
          （三）为反革命分子翻案，
    对抗肃反运动
    一九五六年，正当我国肃清反革命分子的斗争取得重大胜利的时候，吴晗迫不及待地站出来，为反革命分子杨祖霖喊“冤”，利用职权，积极为反革命分子杨祖霖翻案。杨祖霖，是蒋匪军连长。解放前，他在伪温州防守司令、杀人魔王廖肯的指挥下，曾经率领匪部到平阳镇压“大刀会”农民军，沿途烧杀抢劫，是一个有血债的刽子手。解放后，杨祖霖隐瞒反革命身份，混入义乌县吴店中心小学担任教员。在肃反斗争中，群众揭发了他的反革命罪恶，把他从人民教师队伍中清除了出去。这样做，是完全必要的，正确的，是符合党的肃反政策的。可是，身为北京市副市长的吴晗，却对人民的这一公正处理大为不满。吴晗收到反革命分子杨祖霖污蔑肃反斗争和喊“冤”叫“屈”的信件之后，就写信给浙江省人民委员会，为反革命分子大声喊“冤”，要当地政府为反革命分子“平冤”、“翻案”。与此同时，他还亲自给杨祖霖写了一封“慰问信”。原文如下：
       “琅芝、家骐祖霖兄：
    信收到。已转请浙江省人民委员会查处。
    我相信，一定会水落石出，妥善解决。
        此致敬礼。
                        吴晗八月二十九日”
    好一个“祖霖兄”！好一个“水落石出，妥善解决”！看，吴晗在这里同反革命分子杨祖霖称兄道弟，多亲热！看，吴晗在这里给反革命分子杨祖霖打气打得多起劲！但是，由于杨祖霖的反革命罪行铁证如山，吴晗为反革命分子翻案的阴谋并没有得逞。不过，他这种反动行径却大大助长了杨祖霖的反革命气焰。杨祖霖自恃有了吴晗这个“大靠山”，便疯狂地向党向人民政府和当地群众进行反扑。他公开谩骂干部，张贴反动标语，攻击我们党的阶级斗争学说。说什么“共产党的阶级斗争理论，永远是四类分子的活棺材”。因为这个反革命分子不服管制，受到了广大贫下中农的坚决斗争。
      （四）煽动牛鬼蛇神向党进攻
    一九五九年六、七月，庐山会议前夕，正当右倾机会主义分子猖狂向党进攻的时候，吴晗一手抛出《海瑞骂皇帝》等毒草，为右倾机会主义分子擂鼓助战；一手又抛出《投枪集》，在《记第八大队》这篇《还乡散记》中，为当地大地主杨德鉴和右派分子季洪业涂脂抹粉，吹捧杨德鉴“为人精明”，“忠厚”、“慷慨”，“喜欢朋友”，懂得“抗日救国的道理”，等等。他明目张胆地篡改历史，把大地主和右派分子“封”为“开创”金萧支队第八大队的“功臣”。不仅如此，吴晗还胡说什么在我党领导下组织起来的金萧支队第八大队是“开明地主和人民自动组织起来的抗日自卫武装”，为地主阶级大唱颂歌，公开煽动牛鬼蛇神，配合右倾机会主义分子向党进攻。
    一九六二年，正当本省农村由于连年遭受自然灾害，遇到暂时困难的时候，吴晗又再一次挺身而出，继续煽动四类分子向党进攻。那一年冬天，义乌义亭公社反革命分子鲍文达和金华傅村公社叛党分子傅章风，先后写信给吴晗，信中恶毒攻击人民公社，攻击党的政策，都立即得到吴晗的“深切同情”和“关怀”。他以“高级领导人”的姿态，直接写信给义亭、傅村公社党委，要他们满足反革命分子和叛徒提出来的种种“要求”。
    毛主席教导我们，什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。吴晗虽然口口声声标榜自己“政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的”，但是，他自己在解放十六年来的所作所为，恰好粉碎了他自己的种种鬼话，暴露了他自己的真面目。原来，他所“站稳了的”，根本不是无产阶级的阶级立场，而是一贯地顽固地站在地主、资产阶级的立场上；他不是什么革命派，而是一贯与人民为敌的反革命派，是一个进行资本主义和封建主义复辟的阴谋家！一个反共反人民反革命的老手。我们必须认清他的反革命本质，彻底揭穿他的反革命阴谋！扯下他的伪装，连同“三家村”一起，彻底粉碎！
