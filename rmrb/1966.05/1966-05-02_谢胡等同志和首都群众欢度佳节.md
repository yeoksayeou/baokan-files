Comrade Shehu and Others Celebrate the Holiday with the People of the Capital
Comrade Liu Ningyi said at the celebration: The Albanian people have achieved great successes in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and in the socialist revolution and construction. Every victory of theirs is a support for us and a great encouragement.
Comrade Kabo said at the celebration: Today we are here to celebrate May Day, which is an expression of the two peoples' opposition to imperialism and revisionism, an expression of the two peoples' firm progress on the socialist road, and an expression of firm support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 1st, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and all the comrades of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by him, accompanied by leaders of our Party and state, celebrated "May Day" International Labor Day with the workers and people of all circles in the capital this morning.

Today, the Party and state leaders of our country who celebrated the festival with the Albanian comrades included Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, He Long, Kang Sheng, Liu Ningyi, Xie Fuzhi and other leaders. Wherever the leaders of China and Albania went, they aroused warm applause and cheers, and the atmosphere was extremely cordial and warm.

At about 10 o'clock in the morning, Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kabo, and all the comrades of the delegation came to the Labor People's Cultural Palace, the center of the capital's festival activities, in the rain. They warmly shook hands with Song Qingling, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Deng Xiaoping and other leaders who were waiting at the entrance of the Cultural Palace. At this time, the surrounding masses applauded warmly and shouted slogans. A group of young girls at the entrance spread out colorful silks and paid tribute to the distinguished guests and our country's leaders with rhythmic and lively dance steps to express their welcome.

The leaders of China and Albania came to various celebration venues. Under the pine and cypress trees, under countless red flags waving in the wind, people beat drums, played music, sang and danced. The entire Cultural Palace presented a magnificent festive scene. Wherever the leaders of China and Albania passed, groups of workers, students, government cadres, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and Young Pioneers waved colorful flowers and cheered "Long live Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Comrade Shehu and Comrade Zhou Enlai and others constantly waved in return and shook hands with the people cordially.

A group of textile workers invited the leaders of China and Albania to their activity site and enthusiastically performed the "Clever Girls" dance. At another activity site, workers from the Jingxi Coal Mine, holding pneumatic picks, performed the "Miner's War Song" dance, which showed their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, work hard, and intensify military training. Comrade Shehu enthusiastically took a pneumatic pick from the workers, then took a rifle and a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" used in the performance, and raised them high, expressing his praise for the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese workers. At this time, the surrounding crowd excitedly shouted:
"Long live the Albanian Party of Labor!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

When the leaders of China and Albania came to the front of the Great Hall of the Cultural Palace, an extremely enthusiastic celebration scene appeared on the square there. People gathered on the square and on the steps of the ancient palace, waving colorful bouquets, and cheers rang out. Under the banner with the words "Workers of all countries, unite!", Comrade Zhou Enlai walked to the loudspeaker and led the audience to shout: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people!" Then, Comrade Shehu also approached the loudspeaker and led everyone to shout in Chinese:
"Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" At this time, the venue was jubilant, and the slogans resounded through the sky.

The celebration turned into a grand rally. Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Hisni Kabo, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, delivered enthusiastic speeches here successively.

In his speech, Comrade Liu Ningyi, on behalf of the workers of the whole country, expressed the warmest welcome to the Albanian comrades. He said that the Albanian people are heroic people who have been tempered in the revolutionary fire. Under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, they are resolutely carrying out the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership group, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and advancing bravely. They hold a pick in one hand and a gun in the other. They would rather die standing than live on their knees. They resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the world.

Liu Ningyi said that the heroic Albanian people have experienced a glorious road. They dare to struggle, dare to win, and fly high in the sky like eagles, seeing high and far, brave and resolute, and regard U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism as decadent paper tigers.

Liu Ningyi said that the Albanian people have achieved great successes in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and in socialist revolution and construction. Every victory of theirs is a support for us and has given us great encouragement. Albania's international status is getting higher and higher, and Albania is respected and loved by the revolutionary people all over the world. We are extremely proud to have such heroic comrades-in-arms. He finally said that the Sino-Albanian friendship is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, developed in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and is eternal and unbreakable. The people of China and Albania will always support each other and advance side by side in the common revolutionary struggle. He finally shouted: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism!" "U.S. imperialism is bound to be defeated!" "Modern revisionism is bound to be defeated!"

Comrade Kabo spoke amid warm applause. He said that today we feel doubly happy because we are here representing our Party and our people, representing Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the fraternal China; because we are celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day together with the 700 million Chinese people. He said that our Party, our people and Comrade Enver Hoxha sent us here to express the strong unity and eternal friendship between our two parties and two countries. The Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people are proud to have the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people as comrades-in-arms advancing side by side.

Comrade Kabo said that the people of Albania and China are connected by an eternal and flesh-and-blood friendship. Such friendship was forged by the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is built on the basis of invincible Marxism-Leninism and will last forever. We will cherish the Albanian-Chinese friendship as we cherish our eyes. This great friendship connects the hearts, pulses, and thoughts of our two peoples.

Comrade Kabo warmly praised the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. He said that the achievements of China have great international significance, and we are happy and proud of your achievements. More than 90% of the people in the world, their hopes, their eyes are all on the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong are the standard-bearers who inspire the people of the world to oppose imperialism and strive for independence and freedom.

Comrade Kabo said with great emotion that our struggle has received the firm support of the great Chinese people. Now, if someone asks us how many people we have, we say 700 million and 100,000! Because we are with the great Chinese people!

Comrade Kabo's words were full of great proletarian internationalist feelings, which aroused a long and stormy applause from the audience.

Comrade Kabo then said that our enemies, imperialism and modern revisionism, are doing everything possible to oppose our two parties and two peoples of Albania and China. They sabotage and blockade us, and do all kinds of evil. But they have suffered a shameful defeat. The future belongs to the people, belongs to Marxism-Leninism; defeat and death belong to the enemies. No matter how the Soviet modern revisionists try to cover up their traitorous faces, the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Albanian Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as all the genuine Marxist-Leninist parties in the world, will surely hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and give them the deserved counterattack, just as we have exposed them in the past.

Comrade Kabo said, today we are here to celebrate "May Day," which is an expression of our two peoples' opposition to imperialism and revisionism, an expression of our two peoples' firm progress on the socialist road, and an expression of firm support for the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

Comrade Kabo finally shouted: "Long live the eternal friendship between Albania and China!" "Glory belongs to the Communist Party of China, the standard-bearer defending the victory of Marxism-Leninism!" "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the close friend of the Albanian people!" "Glory belongs to Marxism-Leninism!"

After the speech, cheers rang out in the square. People sang "On the Golden Hill in Beijing" in unison, and rhythmically shouted "Mao Zedong - Enver", "Enver - Mao Zedong" for a long time. Chinese students and Albanian students present sang "The East is Red" and the Albanian revolutionary song "Eagle of the Guerrillas". When the leaders of China and Albania left here, Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kabo, Comrade Kelezi, Comrade Nase, and Comrade Natanaili waved to everyone again and again. On both sides of the road they passed, the masses holding colorful flowers poured out their unrestrained deep feelings to their Albanian comrades-in-arms. Inside and outside the Cultural Palace, the slogan "Long live the friendship between the great peoples of China and Albania" reverberated for a long time.

Some members of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation also went to the Summer Palace to participate in the celebration after leaving the Cultural Palace, and they were also warmly welcomed by the people of the capital.

    显示中阿人民的亲密友谊和伟大团结
    谢胡等同志和首都群众欢度佳节
    刘宁一同志在联欢会上说：阿尔巴尼亚人民在反帝反修斗争中，在社会主义革命和建设中，取得了伟大的成就，他们的每一个胜利都是对我们的支持和巨大的鼓舞。
    卡博同志在联欢会上说：今天我们在这里庆祝五一，是两国人民反帝反修的表示，是两国人民在社会主义道路上坚决前进的表示，是坚决支持各国人民革命斗争的表示。
    据新华社一日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席谢胡同志，和由他率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，在我国党和国家领导人陪同下，今天上午同首都工人和各界人民一起，欢庆“五一”国际劳动节。
    今天，同阿尔巴尼亚同志一起欢庆节日的我国党和国家领导人，有中华人民共和国副主席宋庆龄，中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来，中共中央副主席、人大常委会委员长朱德，中共中央总书记邓小平，以及陈毅、李富春、贺龙、康生、刘宁一、谢富治等领导人。中阿两国领导人所到之处，激起了热烈的掌声和欢呼声，气氛极为亲切热烈。
    上午十时许，谢胡同志、卡博同志和代表团全体同志，冒雨来到首都节日活动的中心劳动人民文化宫。他们同在文化宫入口处迎候的宋庆龄、周恩来、朱德、邓小平等领导人，一一亲切握手。这时，四周群众热烈鼓掌，高呼口号，入口处一群小姑娘撒开彩绸，以节奏欢快的舞步，向贵宾和我国领导人致敬和表示欢迎。
    中阿两国领导人来到各个联欢场所。在松柏树下，在数不清的迎风招展的红旗下面，人们擂鼓奏乐，高歌欢舞，整个文化宫里呈现一幅壮丽的节日景象。中阿两国领导人经过之处，成群的工人、学生、机关干部、解放军指战员和少先队员，挥舞着彩花，夹道欢呼“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”谢胡同志和周恩来等同志，不断招手致意，并且和人们亲切握手。
    一群纺织女工把中阿两国领导人请到他们活动的场地上，热情奔放地表演了“巧姑娘”舞。在另一个活动场所，拿着风镐的京西煤矿工人演出了他们活学活用毛主席著作、努力生产、加紧练武的“矿工战歌”舞蹈。谢胡同志热情地从工人们手中接过一把风镐，又接过一支步枪、一本演出用的《毛泽东选集》，高高地举起，对中国工人的革命精神表示赞扬。这时，周围的人群激动地高呼：
  “阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”
    中阿两国领导人来到文化宫大殿前的时候，那里的广场上出现了一个极为热烈的联欢场面。人们聚集在广场上和古老宫殿的台阶上，挥舞着彩色花束，欢呼声响成一片。在悬挂着写有“全世界无产者联合起来”的横幅下面，周恩来同志走到扩音器前，领导全场高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“中阿两国人民的友谊万岁！”接着，谢胡同志也走近扩音器，用中国话领导大家高呼：
  “毛泽东同志万岁！”这时，会场欢腾，口号声响彻云霄。
    联欢变成了一次盛大的集会。中华全国总工会主席刘宁一同志，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员希斯尼·卡博同志，在这里先后发表了热情洋溢的讲话。
    刘宁一同志在讲话时代表全国工人向阿尔巴尼亚同志表示最热烈的欢迎。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民是在革命烈火中久经锻炼的英雄人民，他们在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，坚决进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，奋勇前进。他们一手拿镐，一手拿枪，他们宁可站着死，不愿跪着活。他们坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持亚非拉人民和全世界人民的革命斗争。
    刘宁一说，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民经历了一条光荣的道路，他们敢于斗争，敢于胜利，象山鹰一样飞翔高空，看得高，看得远，英勇坚决，把美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义统统看成是腐朽的纸老虎。
    刘宁一说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在反帝反修斗争中，在社会主义革命和建设中，取得了伟大的成就，他们的每一个胜利都是对我们的支持，给了我们巨大的鼓舞。阿尔巴尼亚的国际地位越来越高，阿尔巴尼亚受到了全世界革命人民的尊敬和爱戴，我们以有这样英雄的战友而感到极大的自豪。他最后说，中阿友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义基础之上的，是在反帝反修斗争中发展起来的，是永恒的，牢不可破的。中阿两国人民在共同的革命斗争中永远相互支持，并肩前进。他最后高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“马克思列宁主义胜利万岁！”“美帝国主义必败！”“现代修正主义必败！”
    卡博同志在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，今天我们感到加倍的高兴，因为我们是代表我们党和我们的人民，代表恩维尔·霍查同志，来到兄弟的中国的；因为我们是同七亿中国人民一起欢庆“五一”国际劳动节。他说，我们党、我们的人民和恩维尔·霍查同志派我们到这里来，就是表示我们两党两国坚强的团结和永恒友谊的。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，因为有中国共产党和中国人民这样并肩前进的战友而感到自豪。
    卡博同志说，阿中两国人民是由永恒的血肉相联的友谊联系在一起的。这样的友谊是以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党铸炼起来的，它建立在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义基础上，将万古长青。我们将象爱护眼珠一样爱护阿中友谊。这种伟大的友谊把我们两国人民的心、脉搏和思想都联结在一起。
    卡博同志热情地赞扬了中国人民在中国共产党领导下所取得的辉煌成就。他说，中国所取得的成就，有着巨大的国际意义，我们为你们的成就感到高兴和自豪。全世界百分之九十以上的人民，他们的希望，他们的眼睛都向着伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志。中国共产党和毛泽东同志是鼓舞全世界人民反对帝国主义、争取独立、自由的旗手。
    卡博同志满怀激情地说，我们的斗争得到了伟大的中国人民的坚决支持。现在，如果有人问我们有多少人口时，我们说有七亿零一百万！因为我们同伟大的中国人民在一起！
    卡博同志的这些话，充满了伟大的无产阶级国际主义感情，激起了全场长时间的暴风雨般的掌声。
    卡博同志接着说，我们的敌人帝国主义和现代修正主义，千方百计地反对我们阿中两党和两国人民。他们破坏和封锁我们，无恶不作。但是他们遭到了可耻的失败。未来是属于人民的，属于马克思列宁主义的；失败和死亡是属于敌人的。不管苏联现代修正主义者怎样掩盖他们的叛逆面目，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，以及全世界所有真正的马克思列宁主义的政党，必将高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，给他们以应有的回击，就象过去我们揭露他们那样。
    卡博同志说，今天我们在这里庆祝“五一”，这是我们两国人民反对帝国主义和修正主义的表示，是我们两国人民在社会主义道路上坚决前进的表示，是坚决支持各国人民革命斗争的表示。
    卡博同志最后高呼：“阿中友谊万古长青！”“光荣属于捍卫马克思列宁主义胜利的旗手——中国共产党！”“祝中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民亲密的朋友毛泽东同志万寿无疆！”“光荣属于马克思列宁主义！”
    讲话以后，广场上响起一片欢呼声。人们齐声高唱《在北京的金山上》，并且有节奏地长时间地高呼“毛泽东—恩维尔”、“恩维尔—毛泽东”。在场的中国学生和阿尔巴尼亚留学生，唱起了《东方红》和阿尔巴尼亚革命歌曲《游击队之鹰》。中阿两国领导人离开这里的时候，谢胡同志、卡博同志、凯莱齐同志、纳赛同志和纳塔奈利同志，一再向大家挥手致意。在他们经过的道路两旁，手执彩花的群众尽情地向阿尔巴尼亚战友倾注他们不可抑制的深厚情意。文化宫内外长时间地震响着“中阿两国伟大人民的友谊万岁”的口号声。
    阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的部分成员，在离开文化宫以后，还到颐和园参加了联欢，他们也受到了首都群众的热烈欢迎。
