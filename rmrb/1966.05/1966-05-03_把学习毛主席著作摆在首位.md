    Putting the Study of Chairman Mao's Works First
    This oil painting depicts the scene of the Party branch of the Casting Workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Casting Pipe Plant using Mao Zedong Thought to command and conduct ideological and political work.
    In 1963, Comrade Mao Zedong issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng." When studying Lei Feng and discussing Lei Feng's path to growth, this Party branch realized that studying Chairman Mao's works was the fundamental guarantee for realizing ideological revolutionization, and began to consciously grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works firmly.
    Over the past few years, this branch has persisted in placing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work. In the three great revolutionary movements, they aimed at the workers' living thoughts, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, class education as the foundation, and actual struggle as the classroom, grasped the fundamental issue of transforming the world outlook, and actively carried out the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. This greatly promoted the workers' conscious revolution, and brought about tremendous changes in the workers' mental outlook and the workshop's production outlook.　(Picture attached)

    把学习毛主席著作摆在首位
    这幅油画，描绘的是鞍钢铸管厂铸造车间党支部用毛泽东思想挂帅，做思想政治工作的情景。
    一九六三年，毛泽东同志发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召。这个党支部在学习雷锋，在讨论雷锋成长道路的时候，认识到学习毛主席著作是实现思想革命化的根本保证，开始自觉地狠抓毛主席著作的学习。
    几年来，这个支部坚持把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位。在三大革命运动中，他们针对职工的活思想，以毛泽东思想为武器，以阶级教育为基础，以实际斗争为课堂，抓住改造世界观这个根本问题，积极开展兴无灭资的斗争。这就大大促进了职工的自觉革命，使职工的精神面貌和车间的生产面貌都发生了巨大变化。　（附图片）
