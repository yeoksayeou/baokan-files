    Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are extensively carrying out activities to learn from Comrade Zhang Chunyu, deputy squad leader and Communist Party member of a certain unit of the Railway Corps. The commanders and fighters expressed that they must learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way like Zhang Chunyu, treat Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instruction, consciously and diligently transform their ideology, and truly become hard-boned fighters who are wholeheartedly for the public and wholeheartedly for the people.
    Zhang Chunyu is an advanced figure in the Lei Feng mold. Since joining the army in 1963, he has consistently studied Chairman Mao's works conscientiously and acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions in everything he did. In the early morning of June 30, 1965, an unexpected cave-in occurred during tunnel construction at one location. Zhang Chunyu remained calm in the face of danger, stepped forward bravely, and worked with other comrades to bravely rescue injured comrades-in-arms. Unfortunately, he was trapped for two hours and forty minutes by a falling rock weighing tens of thousands of pounds. Despite being seriously injured, he was still very concerned about the safety of other comrades-in-arms and the work of the company, demonstrating the noble qualities and heroic and tenacious hard-boned spirit of a revolutionary fighter armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The leading organs of the Railway Corps awarded Zhang Chunyu a first-class merit for this.
    In April of this year, the Party Committee of the Railway Corps issued a notice calling on its subordinate units to extensively and deeply carry out activities to learn from Comrade Zhang Chunyu. The notice pointed out that Comrade Zhang Chunyu's glorious deeds once again vividly proved that: People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat power. To learn from Comrade Zhang Chunyu is to resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin Biao's five principles on continuing to give prominence to politics, further set off a new upsurge in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, accelerate the revolutionization and modernization of the troops, and make greater contributions to defending and building the motherland.
    In the activities of learning from Comrade Zhang Chunyu, the broad masses of commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps deeply realized that Zhang Chunyu's hard-boned spirit of the proletariat, being wholeheartedly for the public, originated from the great Mao Zedong Thought. They said that Comrade Zhang Chunyu has set an example for us in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works. To learn from Zhang Chunyu, the most fundamental thing is to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way like him, consciously transform ourselves, realize ideological revolutionization, and do good deeds for the people for a lifetime. Many comrades also restudied Chairman Mao's five requirements for successors to the proletarian revolution, looked at Zhang Chunyu's growth process, and found the gaps in their own thinking and actions. Li Jinhong, a five-good soldier of a certain unit, after learning about Zhang Chunyu's deeds, compared and examined himself and found that he was not as good as Zhang Chunyu in studying Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, and the effect of transforming his ideology was not as good as Zhang Chunyu's. He was determined to take Zhang Chunyu as an example, step up the transformation of his ideology, and become a good soldier of Chairman Mao. Some comrades who were recuperating with Zhang Chunyu saw that Zhang Chunyu, despite being seriously injured, never forgot to study Chairman Mao's works, and excitedly expressed: We must be like Zhang Chunyu, resting our bodies but not our minds, and persist in reading Chairman Mao's books at all times. Encouraged by Zhang Chunyu, the medical staff responsible for treating and caring for Zhang Chunyu became more conscious of the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works.
    During this period, many leading cadres of the Railway Corps went deep into the grassroots level and used Zhang Chunyu's typical deeds to vigorously grasp the implementation of giving prominence to politics. Jiang Shiliang, Song Lianshan and other leading cadres of a certain unit went deep into companies and platoons to investigate and understand the situation, and in response to the living thoughts of the soldiers, introduced to everyone their own experiences in learning from Zhang Chunyu. They also organized everyone to discuss "Where does Zhang Chunyu's heroic behavior come from? What should we learn from Zhang Chunyu?" and "How to correctly handle the relationship between politics and technology?" Through discussion, everyone clearly realized that only by arming ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought like Zhang Chunyu can we pass the test under any circumstances; only by using Mao Zedong Thought to command technology can technology also pass the test. They said that Zhang Chunyu's hard-boned actions are the result of giving prominence to politics. In our work, we must not only pay attention to material achievements, but also pay more attention to spiritual achievements, and put the ideological revolutionization of people first at all times.

    铁道兵广大指战员抓住学习张春玉的根本
    要象张春玉那样活学活用毛主席著作
    新华社二十日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵部队广泛开展向铁道兵某部副班长、共产党员张春玉同志学习的活动。指战员们表示，要象张春玉那样活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，自觉地刻苦地改造思想，真正成为一心为公、一心为人民的硬骨头战士。
    张春玉是雷锋式的先进人物。他从一九六三年入伍以来，一贯认真学习毛主席著作，处处按毛主席的指示办事。一九六五年六月三十日凌晨，在一处隧道施工时突然发生意外塌方。张春玉临危不惧，挺身而出，同其他同志一起奋勇抢救受伤战友，不幸被塌落的万斤巨石卡住二小时四十分钟之久。他身负重伤，还十分关心其他战友的安危和连队工作，表现了一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的高尚品质和英勇顽强的硬骨头精神。铁道兵领导机关为此给予张春玉记一等功奖励。
    今年四月，铁道兵党委发出通知，号召所属部队广泛深入地开展学习张春玉同志的活动。通知指出，张春玉同志的光辉事迹又一次生动地证明了：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力。学习张春玉同志，就是要坚决执行林彪副主席关于继续突出政治的五项原则，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，加速部队革命化、现代化建设，为保卫祖国、建设祖国作出更大贡献。
    在学习张春玉同志的活动中，铁道兵广大指战员深深体会到：张春玉一心为公的无产阶级硬骨头精神，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说，张春玉同志为我们树立了活学活用毛主席著作的榜样，学习张春玉，最根本的就是要象他那样活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地改造自己，实现思想革命化，为人民做一辈子好事。许多同志还重新学习了毛主席关于无产阶级革命接班人的五个条件，看张春玉的成长过程，找自己思想和行动上的差距。某部五好战士李进宏学习张春玉事迹后，对照检查自己带着问题学习毛主席著作不如他好，改造思想的效果不如他好，决心以张春玉为榜样，加紧改造思想，做毛主席的好战士。一些和张春玉在一起治疗休养的同志，看到张春玉身负重伤还时刻不忘学习毛主席著作，激动地表示：要象张春玉那样，身体休息，思想不休息，在任何时候都坚持读毛主席的书。在张春玉的鼓舞下，负责治疗护理张春玉的医护人员活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性更高了。
    这期间，铁道兵许多领导干部纷纷深入基层，运用张春玉的典型事迹，狠抓突出政治的落实。某部领导干部姜世良、宋连山等深入班排调查了解情况，并针对战士的活思想，向大家介绍自己学习张春玉的体会，还组织大家讨论“张春玉的英雄行为从何而来？向张春玉学习什么？”和“如何正确处理政治与技术的关系？”通过讨论，大家明确认识到，只有象张春玉那样用毛泽东思想武装自己，才能在任何情况下都过得硬；只有用毛泽东思想统帅技术，技术也才能过得硬。他们说，张春玉的硬骨头行动是突出政治的结果。在工作中我们不但要重视物质成果，更要重视精神成果，在任何时候都要把人的思想革命化放在第一位。
