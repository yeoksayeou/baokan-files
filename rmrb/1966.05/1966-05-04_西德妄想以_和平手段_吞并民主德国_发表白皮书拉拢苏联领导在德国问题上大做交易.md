    West Germany Fantasizes About Annexing East Germany Through "Peaceful Means"
    Publishes White Paper to Woo Soviet Leaders for Deals on the German Question
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 2nd, the West German government published a white paper on the German question on April 29th, once again emphasizing the West German ruling clique's desire to annex the German Democratic Republic through negotiations with the Soviet Union and other "peaceful means."
    This 562-page white paper, which compiles a large number of official documents and speeches, is a continuation of the Bonn government's recent "peaceful offensive" surrounding the issue of German reunification. In the preface to this white paper, the West German government stubbornly adheres to its consistent position of annexing the German Democratic Republic, claiming that "completing Germany's unification in freedom" is the "highest goal" of West German policy, that West Germany is "the only German government entitled to speak for Germany in international affairs," and that West Berlin is "inseparably linked" to West Germany. In order to conceal the expansionist and revanchist ambitions of the West German ruling clique, the white paper dwells on "contributing to détente" and "renouncing the use of force," attempting to achieve the German "reunification" of subverting the German Democratic Republic under the banner of "peaceful policy."
    The preface to the white paper refuses to recognize the German Democratic Republic and states that it will negotiate with the Soviet Union to achieve its conspiracy to annex the German Democratic Republic. It emphasizes that West Germany "has consistently and patiently tried to hold talks with Moscow," and that the West German government "has always believed that its diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union should be a means of reaching an understanding on all issues related to reunification." It says that "if the Soviet Union truly shows interest, individual issues will be discussed first." It points out that "West Germany will firmly adhere to the principle of not making concessions without concessions from the other side."
    When talking about relations with Eastern European countries, the white paper emphasizes "normalizing the relations between the Federal Republic (referring to West Germany) and Eastern European countries without abandoning Germany's vital interests."
    West German Chancellor Erhard issued a statement on the same day regarding the white paper, saying that the white paper embodies the West German government's "firmness in goals and flexibility in methods regarding the German question." He called on the Soviet Union and West Germany to "mutually agree to recognize each other's vital interests" and viciously slandered the German Democratic Republic as a "threat to world peace" and a "moral burden on the Soviet Union."
    The West German government's "peaceful offensive" surrounding the German question began with the West German government's distribution of "peace notes" to many countries, including the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, on March 25th.
    Since then, the West German government has launched a series of activities to promote its "peaceful offensive." On April 20th, the West German government issued a statement announcing its willingness to provide "advice, support, and assistance" to the Social Democratic Party, whose chairman Brandt and others, to go to Karl Marx City in the German Democratic Republic and invite United Socialist Party members to Hanover, a city in West Germany, to engage in debate on the issue of German unification. The *Bonn Review* commented: "The benefits of this debate are obvious; it will cause riots in the occupied territories (referring to the German Democratic Republic)."
    While employing various "peaceful" means and claiming to "hope for more détente," the West German authorities are strengthening their hostility and provocations towards the German Democratic Republic. Shortly after West Germany sent out the so-called "peace notes," the West German Parliament blatantly held the so-called "Federal Parliament Berlin Week" provocatively in West Berlin. Many senior West German government officials, including Erhard, also went to the city to engage in activities and make remarks hostile to the German Democratic Republic. Remer, Erhard's "representative" in West Berlin, also嚣张 declared on April 23rd that the West German Parliament and Erhard would strengthen their activities in West Berlin in the future in order to make West Germany's "stay" in West Berlin "more clear."

### 西德妄想以“和平手段”吞并民主德国  发表白皮书拉拢苏联领导在德国问题上大做交易

    西德妄想以“和平手段”吞并民主德国
    发表白皮书拉拢苏联领导在德国问题上大做交易
    据新华社波恩二日电　西德政府在四月二十九日发表了一本关于德国问题的白皮书，再次强调西德统治集团要通过同苏联谈判等“和平手段”来吞并德意志民主共和国。
    这本长达五百六十二页、汇集了大量官方文件和言论的白皮书，是波恩政府最近围绕德国重新统一问题而展开的
  “和平攻势”的继续。西德政府在为这个白皮书写的序言里顽固坚持西德政府一贯的吞并德意志民主共和国的立场，声称“完成德国在自由中的统一”是西德政策的“最高目标”，西德是“有权在国际事务中代表德国发言的唯一的德国政府”，西柏林同西德“不可分地联系在一起”。为了掩饰西德统治集团扩张主义和复仇主义的野心，白皮书大谈什么“对缓和作出贡献”，“放弃使用武力”，力图在“和平政策”的招牌下实现颠覆德意志民主共和国的德国“重新统一”。
    白皮书的序言拒不承认德意志民主共和国，并且表示要同苏联进行谈判来实现它吞并德意志民主共和国的阴谋。它强调西德“一直坚持不渝地和有耐心地试图同莫斯科会谈”，西德政府“一开始就认为，它同苏联的外交关系，应该是一种就一切与重新统一有关的问题取得谅解的手段”。它说，“如果苏联真正显示出有兴趣的话，将首先就单个问题进行讨论”。它指出，“西德将坚定地遵循在对方不让步的情况下不作让步的原则”。
    在谈到同东欧国家关系时，白皮书强调“在不放弃德国切身利益的情况下，实现联邦共和国（指西德）同东欧国家关系的正常化”。
    西德总理艾哈德同一天就白皮书发表声明说，白皮书体现了西德政府“目标上坚定，方法上灵活的德国问题政策”。他呼吁苏联同西德“双方同意认可对方的切身利益”，并且恶毒污蔑德意志民主共和国是“世界和平的威胁”，是“苏联的一种道义上的负担”。
    西德政府围绕德国问题的这个“和平攻势”，是从西德政府三月二十五日向包括苏联东欧国家在内的许多国家分发“和平照会”开始的。
    自从那时以来，西德政府为推进它的“和平攻势”而展开了一连串活动。四月二十日，西德政府发表声明，宣布愿意为西德社会民主党派这个党的主席勃兰特等人去德意志民主共和国的卡尔·马克思城，并邀请统一社会党派人在西德城市汉诺威，就统一德国问题展开论战，而向社会民主党提供
  “建议、支持和帮助”。《波恩评论报》评论说：“这种论战的好处是显而易见的，它会使占领区（指德意志民主共和国）发生骚乱。”
    西德当局在施展种种“和平”手腕，宣称“希望更多一些缓和”的同时，正在加强它对德意志民主共和国的敌视和挑衅。就在西德送出所谓“和平照会”后不久，西德议会就公然在西柏林挑衅性地举行所谓“联邦议院柏林周”。包括艾哈德在内的西德政府许多要员也都到这个城市活动，发表敌视德意志民主共和国的言论。艾哈德在西柏林的“代表”勒麦尔四月二十三日还嚣张地宣称，西德议会和艾哈德今后将加强在西柏林的活动，以便使西德“呆在”西柏林“更加明确化”。
