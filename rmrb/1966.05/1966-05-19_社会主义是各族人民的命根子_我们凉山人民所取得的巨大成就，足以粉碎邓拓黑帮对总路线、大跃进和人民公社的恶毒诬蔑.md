    Socialism is the Lifeline of All Ethnic Groups
    The Tremendous Achievements of Our Liangshan People are Enough to Shatter Deng Tuo's Gang's Vicious Slanders Against the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes
    By Ligu Guoge, Deputy County Head of Zhaojue County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, and Delegate to the National People's Congress

    In his "Evening Talks at Yanshan," Deng Tuo curses our General Line and the Great Leap Forward as "bragging" and "exaggerating," and curses our socialist construction as "finished." What difference is there between this and the slanders of imperialism and revisionism against us? Here, I will use ironclad facts and the great achievements made by the people of Liangshan under the brilliant banner of the General Line to answer the attacks and slanders of Deng Tuo and his ilk.

    Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the more than 700,000 slaves of Liangshan overthrew the dark slave society and shattered the shackles that had been on their necks for generations. Is this "bragging" or "exaggerating"?

    Before liberation, under the barbaric rule and shackles of the slave system, the average yield of grain per mu in Liangshan was only a few dozen jin. After democratic reform and agricultural collectivization, the vast numbers of Yi people who had been emancipated from slavery threw themselves into the vigorous Three Great Revolutionary Movements. Now, the grain yield per mu has reached more than 300 jin. Is this "bragging" or "exaggerating"?

    Since liberation, especially since the Great Leap Forward, the people of Liangshan, under the leadership of the Party, have worked hard to make every county accessible by car, have electric lights and telephones, and have built countless large and small reservoirs, ditches, hydroelectric power stations, electric irrigation stations, machine factories, and farm tool factories. Schools have also been established in all counties, districts, and townships. These are all tremendous achievements of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward. Is this also "bragging" or "exaggerating"?

    In the evil old society, the Yi people did not even have a needle or thread, and could not even afford salt for several years, nor had they ever worn a good piece of clothing. Now, we eat three meals a day, wear cloth clothes, and live a prosperous life. Is this also "bragging" or "exaggerating"?

    Looking at the whole country, we have Daqing and Dazhai, we have built a 12,000-ton hydraulic press, and we have successfully conducted three nuclear tests. Industrial and agricultural production have achieved unprecedented development. Isn't this a fact?

    I lived under the slave owner's whip. Recalling the evil slave system, I am filled with grief and indignation, and the suffering of the past floats before my eyes. My family has been slaves for generations. When I was very young, I followed my parents to be slaves for the landlords, forced to do heavy work for the slave owners like adults. We never had a full meal; we only relied on a piece of burlap and broken sheepskin to keep out the wind, and we never wore clothes or shoes. We had nowhere to live at night, and we huddled with the sheep for warmth. We worked all day without rest, and if we did not please the slave owners, we would be beaten severely. When I was seven years old, my mother was tortured to death, and my father was sold by the slave owner. This is all bloody testimony to the slave system.

    Deng Tuo, this so-called "erudite" and "generalist," doesn't he know about this barbaric slave system? He deliberately slanders the leadership of our Party, wanting us to return to slave society. Chairman Mao taught us: "The intellectuals who harbor hostile feelings towards our country are a very small minority. These people do not like our proletarian dictatorship. They miss the old society. Given the opportunity, they will stir up trouble, wanting to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old China." Deng Tuo is such a reactionary element who is hostile to our socialist cause. He has deep-seated hatred for the leadership of our Party, for our socialist cause, and for the General Line. His slander of our Party's leadership as "bragging" and "exaggerating" is aimed at inciting our various ethnic groups to oppose the Party's General Line and the Great Leap Forward. The great red banner of the General Line is the lifeline of our various ethnic groups, so Deng Tuo and others who have deep-seated hatred for the people are attacking us from here. We will never allow Deng Tuo and his ilk to slander the great red banner of the General Line. The more they oppose and slander us, the higher we must hold it. We shout: Long live the great red banner of the General Line! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!

    社会主义是各族人民的命根子
    我们凉山人民所取得的巨大成就，足以粉碎邓拓黑帮对总路线、大跃进和人民公社的恶毒诬蔑
    全国人民代表大会代表凉山彝族自治州昭觉县副县长  里古果各
    邓拓在《燕山夜话》里骂我们的总路线和大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，骂我们社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了，这同帝国主义、修正主义对我们的诬蔑有什么区别？这里我要用铁一般的事实，用我们凉山人民在总路线伟大红旗照耀下所取得的伟大成就来回答邓拓之流的攻击和诬蔑。
    我们凉山七十多万奴隶在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，推翻了黑暗的奴隶社会，粉碎了世世代代套在脖子上的枷锁，这难道是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？
    解放前，凉山在奴隶制度野蛮的统治和束缚下，粮食平均亩产只有几十斤，经过民主改革和农业集体化以后，广大彝族翻身奴隶投入到轰轰烈烈的三大革命运动中去。现在粮食亩产已达三百多斤。这难道是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？
    解放以来，特别是大跃进以来，凉山人民在党的领导下，经过辛勤劳动，使每个县通了汽车，有了电灯电话，修了无数的大小水库、沟渠。水电站、电灌站、机械厂、农具厂也都建立起来了，各县、区、乡都办了学校。这些都是总路线、大跃进的巨大成就，难道这也是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”吗？
    彝族人民在万恶的旧社会里连一针一线都没有，甚至几年都吃不上盐巴，没有穿过一件好衣服。现在，我们每天吃三顿饭，穿上了布衣服，过着富裕的生活。这难道也是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”吗？
    就全国来说，我们有了大庆、大寨，制成了一万二千吨水压机，成功地进行了三次核试验，工农业生产得到了史无前例的发展。难道这不是事实吗？
    我是在奴隶主的皮鞭下生活过来的。回忆起万恶的奴隶制度，真是悲愤交加，往日的苦难生活又浮现在眼前。我家祖祖辈辈都是奴隶。我很小就随父母给地主当奴隶，象大人一样被逼给奴隶主干重活。我们没有吃过一顿饱饭；只靠一张麻布片和破羊皮遮风，没有穿过一件衣服、一双鞋子。晚上无处安身，和羊挤在一起取暖。我们整天劳动，没有休息，稍不如奴隶主心愿，就要遭到毒打。我七岁的时候，母亲被折磨死了，父亲被奴隶主卖了。这都是奴隶制度血的见证。
    邓拓，这个所谓“博古通今”的“杂家”，难道不知道这野蛮的奴隶制度吗？他故意诬蔑我们党的领导，要我们重新回到奴隶社会里去。毛主席教导说：“对于我们的国家抱着敌对情绪的知识分子，是极少数。这种人不喜欢我们这个无产阶级专政的国家，他们留恋旧社会。一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”邓拓就是这样一个敌视我们社会主义事业的反动分子，他对我们党的领导，对我们社会主义事业，对总路线，有刻骨仇恨。他诬蔑我们党的领导是“吹牛皮”，“说大话”，其目的是挑拨我们各族人民来反对党的总路线和大跃进。总路线的伟大红旗是我们各民族人民的命根子，所以邓拓等对人民有刻骨仇恨的人，反对我们才从这里开刀。我们决不许邓拓之流对总路线的伟大红旗进行诬蔑。他们越是反对，越是诬蔑，我们越要把它举得高高的。我们高呼：总路线的伟大红旗万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！
