    Revolutionary Measures Vigorously Promote the Development of Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Albania's Production Front Presents a Great Situation
    People's Army Officers and Soldiers Are Closer, More Spirited, and Brave and Handsome After the Abolition of Military Ranks
    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 2nd: This correspondent reports: At present, the situation on Albania's industrial and agricultural production front is very good. A series of major revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party and the government last winter and this spring have vigorously promoted the development of production.
    On the agricultural front, the broad masses of peasants, under the great call of the Labor Party to "vigorously develop agricultural production and strive for national self-sufficiency in grain production" and "fighting for grain is fighting for socialism and strengthening the motherland," have launched a high tide of great production. Peasants in various places are actively reclaiming wasteland and deep-plowing the land, and accumulating organic fertilizer in large quantities. By the end of March, the country had reclaimed more than 11,000 hectares (each hectare is equivalent to 15 mu) of land; the area of land deep-plowed to more than 40 centimeters reached 75,000 hectares, creating the highest deep-plowing record in Albanian history. Leading cadres at all levels and cadres sent to lower levels, unafraid of dirt or fatigue, took the lead in collecting human and animal manure, setting an example with their own practical actions, and changing the old habits of not collecting and using human and animal manure in many areas in the past. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of March, the amount of organic fertilizer applied nationwide reached 1.36 million tons. Now, every agricultural cooperative in the country has built manure pits and is vigorously promoting the experience of using human manure to fertilize fields.
    The Party's revolutionary measures have become a huge driving force for promoting spring plowing and sowing. As of April 23, the progress of spring plowing and sowing across the country was 8 percent faster than in the same period last year.
    In order to ensure increased crop production, water conservancy projects are being built everywhere in the country to expand the irrigated area. This year alone, the state will build 80 water conservancy projects.
    The Party's revolutionary spirit and measures have also promoted the development of production in industrial and mining enterprises. Many industrial and mining enterprises have transferred a large number of personnel to support agricultural production this spring. However, the workers who remain at their posts have demonstrated revolutionary vigor and labor enthusiasm, and have successfully completed industrial and mining production tasks. In the first three months of this year, enterprises under the Ministry of Industry overfulfilled their production plans by 56,000 meters of cloth, 32,000 pairs of shoes, and 1,540 cubic meters of wood. In the first quarter of this year, the Tirana region overfulfilled the state plan by producing 44,000 meters of cloth, 18,000 shirts, and 9,500 shovels, hoes, and other agricultural implements.
    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 4th: This correspondent reports: The decision of the Albanian Labor Party to abolish the military rank system and adopt new military uniforms has come into effect on May 1st. People's Army officers and soldiers have put on new grass-green uniforms without military ranks, only red collar badges. They all appear spirited, brave, and handsome.
    On the morning of May 1st, this reporter visited a unit of the People's Army – the First Assault Brigade, which Comrade Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, commanded during the Liberation War. At that time, this unit was holding a ceremony to celebrate the abolition of military ranks and the adoption of new military uniforms.
    Comrade Torkusi, who was recently appointed as the political commissar of this unit, said: The abolition of the military rank system is of great significance for our political workers in implementing the Party's line. This veteran guerrilla, who once fought for the independence and freedom of the motherland, recalled the scene during the National Liberation War. He said that at that time, our commanders had no military ranks, and fought side by side with the guerrillas, hand in hand, living together day and night, intimately. Now that we have changed into uniforms without military ranks, we are even closer to the soldiers. When I see the soldiers wearing new uniforms, I feel as if they are the guerrillas of yesterday. Torkusi also said that we will strengthen our ties with the masses of soldiers, listen to their opinions, and make officers and soldiers closer.
    During the entertainment performance at the celebration, soldier Jila enthusiastically accompanied himself on a folk instrument and sang a song he composed, which sang:
    “Today we celebrate the festival,
    The military rank system is officially abolished,
      A red star shines on our heads,
    Fighting hand in hand, we are comrades.
        ……”
    Since the Albanian Labor Party announced a series of revolutionary measures, including the abolition of the military rank system, in its open letter on March 4th, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Albanian army have responded to the Party's call with practical actions. Some officers of the People's Army have already been eating, living, and working with the soldiers. Rabi, the political instructor of the Second Company of a certain unit, moved into the soldiers' barracks on the evening of the day the open letter was published. After hearing this news, the soldiers grabbed his bedding, vying to invite him to their class. Through strengthening political and ideological work and the exemplary actions of cadres, the soldiers' enthusiasm for participating in military training and labor has increased even more. Under the slogan of "treating the training ground as the battlefield," they demand to hone their skills in killing the enemy in the worst weather, the most difficult terrain, and the worst conditions; at the same time, they are also vigorously engaged in agricultural production, maximizing the savings in military expenditure, and striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, vegetables, and meat for the army as soon as possible.

    革命化措施有力地推动了工农业生产发展
    阿尔巴尼亚生产战线呈现一片大好形势
    取消军衔后人民军官兵更加亲密精神焕发威武英俊
    据新华社地拉那二日电　本社记者报道：目前，阿尔巴尼亚工农业生产战线的形势很好。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府去冬今春所采取的一系列重大革命化措施，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    在农业战线上，广大农民群众在劳动党发出的“大力发展农业生产，争取全国粮食生产自给”、
  “为粮食而斗争，就是为社会主义和加强祖国而斗争”的伟大号召下，掀起了热火朝天的大生产高潮。各地的农民积极开垦荒地和深翻土地，并大积有机肥料。到三月底为止，全国共开垦了一万一千多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的土地；深翻四十厘米以上的土地面积达七万五千公顷，创造了阿尔巴尼亚历史上深翻的最高纪录。各级领导干部和下放干部不怕脏、不怕累，带头收集人畜粪尿，以自己的实际行动树立了样板，改变了过去不少地区不收集和使用人畜粪尿的旧习惯。据不完全统计，到三月底为止，全国有机肥施肥量达一百三十六万吨。现在，全国每个农业合作社都修建了积粪坑，大力推广使用人粪尿肥田的经验。
    党的革命化措施成了推动春耕春种工作的巨大动力。到四月二十三日为止，全国春耕春播工作的进展速度比去年同期快百分之八。
    为了保证农作物增产，目前全国到处都在大兴水利，扩大灌溉面积。今年仅由国家修建的水利工程就有八十项。
    党的革命化精神和措施也促进了工矿企业生产的发展。许多工矿企业今年春天都调出了大批人员支援农业生产，但是，坚守岗位的职工发挥革命干劲和劳动热情，出色地完成了工矿业生产任务。工业部所属企业今年头三个月超计划生产了五万六千米布、三万二千双鞋和一千五百四十立方米木材。地拉那区今年第一季度为国家超计划生产了四万四千米布、一万八千件衬衣、九千五百把锹和镐等农具。
    据新华社地拉那四日电　本社记者报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党关于取消军衔制和采用新军服的决定，已经从五月一日起生效。人民军军官和士兵穿上了不佩带军衔、只有红色领章的草绿色的新军装。他们个个显得精神焕发，威武英俊。
    记者五月一日早晨访问了人民军某部——阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡同志在解放战争时期指挥过的第一突击旅。当时，这支部队正在举行庆祝取消军衔和采用新军服的仪式。
    不久前被任命为这个部队的政治委员的托尔库西同志说：取消军衔制对我们政治工作人员执行党的路线具有很重要的意义。这位曾经为祖国的独立和自由而战斗过的老游击队员回忆了在民族解放战争时期的情景。他说，那时候，我们的指挥员没有军衔，同游击队员们肩并肩、手挽手地共同战斗，朝夕相处，亲密无间。现在，我们换上了没有军衔的军装，和战士们更加亲近了。我看见穿着新军装的战士，就感到他们好象就是昨天的游击队员。托尔库西还说，我们将更加紧密地联系战士群众，倾听他们的意见，使官兵更加接近。
    在庆祝会上举行文娱表演时，战士吉拉兴致勃勃地用民间乐器伴奏，演唱了他自编的一首歌曲，歌中唱道：
    “今天我们过节日，
    正式取消军衔制，
      一颗红星头上照，
    携手战斗是同志。
        ……”
    自从阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在三月四日的公开信中宣布采取包括取消军衔制在内的一系列革命化措施以来，阿尔巴尼亚全军广大官兵用实际行动响应了党的号召。人民军有些军官已经同战士们同吃、同住、同劳动。某部第二连指导员拉比在公开信公布后的当天晚上，就搬到战士的营房里去住。战士们听到这个消息以后，把他的铺盖抢来抢去，争着要把他请到自己班里去。通过加强政治思想工作和干部们的模范行动，战士们参加军事训练和劳动的热情更加高涨。他们在“把练兵场当战场”的口号下，要求在最坏的气候、最困难的地势和最坏的条件下，苦练杀敌本领；同时还大搞农业生产，最大限度地节约军队开支，争取早日实现军队的粮食、蔬菜和肉食自给。
