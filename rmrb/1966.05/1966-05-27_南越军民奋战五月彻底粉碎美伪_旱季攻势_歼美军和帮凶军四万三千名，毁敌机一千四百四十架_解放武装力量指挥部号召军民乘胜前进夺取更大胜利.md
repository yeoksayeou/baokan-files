    Hanoi, May 25 (Xinhua) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces recently issued a communique stating that after five months of heroic struggle, the South Vietnamese army and people thoroughly shattered the so-called "Dry Season Offensive" launched by the US aggressors and their lackeys, achieving brilliant victories. According to statistics, in the five months from November last year to the end of March this year, the South Vietnamese army and people killed, wounded, and captured a total of 114,000 enemy troops, including 43,000 US aggressor troops and accomplice troops.

    In these five months, the South Vietnamese army and people completely annihilated more than thirty enemy regular battalions and one hundred and forty-eight companies, including fourteen infantry battalions, seven armored battalions of US and accomplice troops, and twenty-two US companies. In addition, the South Vietnamese army and people shot down and destroyed 1,440 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed 1,310 military vehicles of various types (including 330 tanks and armored vehicles), sunk 27 warships, destroyed 102 bridges, and eliminated or forced the enemy to withdraw from one military sub-region, forty-three strongholds, and seventy outposts, seizing more than 9,000 weapons of various types.

    The communique said that since the middle of last year, the US aggressors, facing the increasing disintegration and collapse of the South Vietnamese puppet army and puppet regime, hurriedly increased their troops to South Vietnam and launched a "Dry Season Offensive" in a vain attempt to reverse the losing situation. The US aggressors thought that by relying on the strength of 700,000 US, puppet, and accomplice troops, and in a climate favorable to their artillery, military vehicles, and air force advantages, they could consume and eliminate our armed forces, drive us out of densely populated areas and key areas (the central coastal plain of central Vietnam, the eastern region of the south, and the area around Saigon-Cholon), open up transportation lines, expand the security zones around important bases, and seize the initiative on the battlefield. While wantonly conducting large-scale "sweeps," they also vigorously carried out cunning political deception activities, attempting to concentrate the people in areas under their strict control.

    The communique pointed out that in order to realize this conspiracy, in the five months of the dry season, the US aggressors threw in all their forces on the South Vietnamese battlefield, including the "elite" units of the US aggressor army, the South Korean and Australian accomplice troops, and the main forces of the puppet army, continuously conducting large-scale "sweeps" in many areas of the south for a long time. In addition, they dispatched B-52 strategic bombers to indiscriminately bomb, widely used chemical poisons, and cruelly implemented the barbaric "scorched earth policy" of burning all, killing all, and destroying all. They thought that these barbaric means could threaten the spirit of the South Vietnamese people. However, on the contrary, these inhuman actions further exposed the aggressive face of the US bandits and the traitorous face of the South Vietnamese lackeys, arousing stronger hatred among the southern army and people and further strengthening their determination to strike them harder and more fiercely.

    The communique said that the five months of the dry season were five months in which our army and people frequently struck the enemy in various places. Our three armed forces grew rapidly, cooperated closely, and established incomparably brilliant military exploits. The enemy's "sweeps," especially the large-scale "sweeps" lasting for many days, were all crushed and suffered heavy defeats. In the counter-"sweeps," our army and people cleverly, flexibly, and proactively attacked the enemy, consuming and eliminating a large number of enemy troops.

    The communique said that in the five months of the dry season, the South Vietnamese army and people not only took the initiative to attack the enemy in the counter-"sweeps," but also took the initiative to attack on the enemy's defense lines in the enemy-occupied areas. In the Saigon-Cholon area alone, the Liberation Armed Forces conducted more than seventy battles, annihilating thousands of US and puppet troops. The Liberation Armed Forces also constantly attacked enemy airfields, destroying a large number of enemy aircraft and eliminating many enemy effectives. According to statistics, the number of enemy aircraft destroyed during this period was more than three times the number of enemy aircraft destroyed in 1964. The enemy's various important military bases were trapped in the heavy encirclement of guerrillas, and the enemy's various water and land transportation lines were also frequently attacked and cut off by guerrillas, falling into a state of paralysis.

    The communique said that the victory of the South Vietnamese army and people has put the enemy in a predicament of being beaten everywhere and passively coping with the situation, and they no longer have any safe place. After five months of competition, the US-puppet clique not only failed to eliminate our armed forces, but also suffered heavy blows, suffering serious losses in manpower, material resources, and financial resources. They not only failed to regain the initiative on the battlefield, but became more passive and embarrassed. The puppet army not only failed to be consolidated, but moved further towards disintegration.

    The communique said that the more US aggressor troops come in, the more crimes they commit, and the sharper the contradiction between our nation and the US aggressors and their lackeys. The puppet regime is also increasingly exposing its despicable traitorous face, the storm of political struggle of our urban people is also becoming more and more fierce, and the rule of the US-puppet clique is becoming weaker and weaker. US imperialism is facing fierce opposition from domestic and world public opinion and is in an unprecedentedly isolated situation. The communique said that we have not only eliminated a large number of the enemy's important effectives, but also expanded the liberated areas and widely and vigorously developed guerrilla warfare. We are getting stronger and stronger in the invincible people's war. The various aspects of the various armed forces are constantly being improved. Thousands of heroes and hundreds of "heroic US annihilation" units have emerged in the upsurge of annihilating the US and saving the country.

    The communique concluded by saying that the victory in the dry season has consolidated the confidence of our army and people in the power of people's war, made us more clearly understand the enemy, see their weaknesses, and encouraged our entire army and people to advance and seize greater victories.

    南越军民奋战五月彻底粉碎美伪“旱季攻势”
    歼美军和帮凶军四万三千名，毁敌机一千四百四十架
    解放武装力量指挥部号召军民乘胜前进夺取更大胜利
    新华社河内二十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量指挥部最近发表公报说，越南南方军民经过五个月的英勇奋战，彻底粉碎了美国侵略者和它的走狗发动的所谓“旱季攻势”，取得了辉煌的胜利。据统计，从去年十一月到今年三月底的五个月中，越南南方军民共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人十一万四千名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军四万三千名。
    在这五个月中，越南南方军民全歼敌军三十多个整营和一百四十八个连，其中包括美军和帮凶军十四个步兵营、七个装甲营和美军二十二个连。此外，南越军民还击落和击毁敌人各种类型飞机一千四百四十架，击毁各种军车一千三百一十辆（其中包括坦克和装甲车三百三十辆），击沉战船二十七艘，炸毁桥梁一百零二座，拔除和迫使敌人撤出一个军事支区、四十三个据点和七十个哨所，缴获各种武器九千多件。
    公报说，自去年年中以来，美国侵略者面临着南越伪军和伪政权日益瓦解和崩溃的危机，匆忙向越南南方大举增兵，并且进行“旱季攻势”，妄图扭转败局。美国侵略者以为，依靠着七十万美、伪军和帮凶军的兵力，在气候有利于它们发挥炮兵、军车和空军优势的情况下，就可以消耗和消灭我们的武装力量，把我们赶出居民稠密区和重点地区（中部中区沿海平原、南部东区、西贡—堤岸周围地区），打通交通线，扩大重要基地周围的安全地带，夺取战场上的主动权。在滥肆进行大规模“扫荡”的同时，它们还大力进行狡猾的政治欺骗活动，企图把人民集中到它们严密控制的地区去。
    公报指出，为了实现这个阴谋，在旱季的五个月中，美国侵略者抛出了它在南越战场上的全部力量，其中包括美国侵略军的“精锐”部队、南朝鲜、澳大利亚帮凶军和伪军的主力部队，连续对南方许多地区进行长时间的大规模“扫荡”。此外，它们还出动B—52型战略轰炸机滥肆进行轰炸，广泛使用化学毒药，残酷地推行野蛮的烧光、杀光、毁光的“焦土政策”，它们以为用这些野蛮手段就可以威胁越南南方人民的精神。但是相反，这些惨无人道的行动却进一步暴露了美国强盗的侵略面目和南越走狗的卖国面目，激起了南方军民更加强烈的仇恨，更加坚定更狠更猛地打击它们。
    公报说，旱季的五个月是我国军民在各地频繁打击敌人的五个月。我们的三种武装力量迅速壮大，紧密合作，立下了无比辉煌的战功。敌人的各次“扫荡”，尤其是持续多天的大规模“扫荡”，都被粉碎了，遭到了惨重的失败。我国军民在反“扫荡”中，机智、灵活和主动地打击敌人，大量消耗和消灭敌人。
    公报说，在旱季的五个月中，南越军民不仅在反“扫荡”中主动地进攻敌人，而且还主动在敌占区的各条防线上出击。仅在西贡、堤岸地区，解放武装力量就进行了七十多次战斗，歼灭了成千名美伪军。解放武装力量还不断袭击敌人的机场，击毁大批敌机和消灭敌人许多有生力量。据统计，在这期间被击毁的敌机等于一九六四年被击毁的敌机的三倍多。敌人的各个重要的军事基地都陷于游击队的重重包围中，敌人的各条水陆交通线也经常遭到游击队的袭击和切断，陷于瘫痪状态。
    公报说，越南南方军民的胜利，已使敌人陷入到处挨打和被动应付的困境，它们已经没有任何安全的地方了。经过五个月的较量，美伪集团不仅消灭不了我们的武装力量，反而遭到了沉重的打击，在人力、物力和财力方面都受到了严重的损失。它们不但没有夺回战场上的主动权，反而更加被动和窘困。伪军不但得不到巩固，反而更加走向瓦解。
    公报说，美国侵略军开进来愈多，它们犯下的罪恶愈多，我们民族同美国侵略者及其走狗之间的矛盾也愈加尖锐。伪政权也日益暴露出它的卑鄙的卖国面目，我们城市人民政治斗争的风暴也日益猛烈，美伪集团的统治越来越削弱。美帝国主义受到国内和世界舆论的激烈反对，处于空前孤立的境地。公报说，我们不仅大量消灭了敌人重要的有生力量，而且还扩大了解放区，广泛和大力地发展游击战争。我们以无敌的人民战争，愈打愈强大。各种武装力量的各方面水平都不断地得到提高。在歼美救国的高潮中涌现出了数以千计的勇士和数以百计的“英勇歼美”单位。
    公报最后说，旱季的胜利，巩固了我们军民对人民战争威力的信心，使我们更加清楚地认识敌人，看清它们的弱点，鼓舞我们全军全民前进，夺取更大的胜利。
