	Fire on the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Black Line
	Gao Ju
	Chairman Mao often warned us: After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight us desperately. We must not underestimate these enemies. Throughout the socialist stage, there runs the struggle between the two roads, socialism and capitalism. In order to ensure socialist construction and prevent capitalist restoration, the socialist revolution must be carried through to the end on the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never neglect the enemies in the ideological field, and never forget the class struggle.
	Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks," as well as the "Notes from Three-Family Village" written under the pen names Wu (i.e., Wu Han), Nan (Ma Nancun, i.e., Deng Tuo), and Xing (Fan Xing, i.e., Liao Mosha), fully illustrate that class struggle in our society is still very acute, complex, and fierce. Class enemies not only sabotage and attack us from the outside but also desperately from the inside. And all anti-Party and anti-socialist elements always direct their attacks against our Party and the socialist system.
	Deng Tuo was the owner of the "Three-Family Village" black shop opened by him, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, and was a ringleader of this small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. They controlled "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" as anti-Party tools, shooting a large number of poisonous arrows and frantically attacking the Party and socialism.
	The anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of Deng Tuo and his small group are by no means accidental or isolated phenomena. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the Party's General Line, the Chinese people went all out, aimed high, and achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward. On the political, economic, and ideological-cultural fronts, with the force of thunder, we fiercely impacted capitalism and the remnant feudal forces. With the further deepening of the socialist revolution, right opportunist elements within the Party, catering to the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, launched a frantic attack on the Party at the Party's Lushan Conference in 1959. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, these right opportunist elements were resolutely countered, their "weapons" were seized, their officials were dismissed, and their anti-Party conspiracy was thoroughly crushed. Subsequently, from 1959 to 1962, due to continuous years of severe natural disasters and the sabotage of Khrushchev's modern revisionists, China encountered temporary economic difficulties. At this time, domestic and foreign class enemies gloated over our misfortune and came out one after another. Right opportunist elements within the Party again coordinated with them and launched a new attack on the Party. Deng Tuo and his gang, in this situation, could not wait to "break out of the gate."
	Harboring a deep-seated hatred for the Party and socialism, Deng Tuo and his gang, starting in 1961, threw out their "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Notes from Three-Family Village." Under the guise of discussing history, imparting knowledge, telling stories, and cracking jokes, they used ancient events to satirize the present, pointed at the mulberry to scold the locust, used veiled language, and made oblique attacks, launching a comprehensive and malicious attack on our great Party. They insulted our Party as "fanatical," "running a high fever," saying "great empty words," and suffering from "amnesia." They viciously attacked the General Line and the Great Leap Forward as "boasting," "wishful thinking," and "replacing reality with fantasy," saying that "the entire property of an egg" was "completely destroyed" and that they "smashed their heads and bled" in the face of the facts. They tried their best to cry out for injustice for the dismissed right opportunist elements, touting their anti-Party "bone structure" and "rebellious character," and encouraging them to make a comeback. They slandered the dictatorship of the proletariat, tried their best to incite dissatisfaction with the socialist system, promoted decadent and declining feudal morality and bourgeois ideology, and cleared the way for capitalist restoration. Deng Tuo even arrogantly clamored for our Party to quickly step down and "rest," saying not to say anything, not to do anything, and to listen to their "guidance" in everything, allowing them to exercise our dictatorship.
	Comrades, please recall, didn't Khrushchev's modern revisionists scold us for "talking big," "boasting," and the Great Leap Forward as "adventurism"? Didn't they praise the right opportunist elements within our Party for "having enough courage"? What is the difference between Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist clamoring and Khrushchev's revisionists' slander and attacks on us?
	Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" are downright anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk. We must seize it, recognize it, expose it, strip off its painted skin, and expose the ugly faces of Deng Tuo and his small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to the light of day. Debts must always be repaid. Deng Tuo's attempts to "deceive the heavens and cross the sea," and to "take the best of the thirty-six strategies, running away," are absolutely impossible. Not only will Deng Tuo not get away with it, but his accomplices will not get away with it either; not only must "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Notes from Three-Family Village" be eradicated, but "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Li Hui Niang," "Xie Yao Huan," and the poisonous weeds in "Chang Duan Lu," etc., all anti-Party and anti-socialist things must be eradicated one by one, without exception.
	It is particularly noteworthy that "Beijing Daily" published a batch of materials in three pages on April 16 under the banner headline "Criticism of 'Three-Family Village' and 'Yanshan Night Talks'," and published the editor's notes of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily." "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" have long been shielding Wu Han and others, but now they suddenly "actively" put out this set of things in a hurry. What is going on here? Are they really going to "launch a serious criticism"? No, not at all. There is much to it, much mystery. They are merely using criticism as a cover to carry out protection, holding up the banner of struggle, and doing the work of sheltering.
	The editor's notes of "Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" placed Deng Tuo, the owner of such an anti-Party and anti-socialist black shop, in the position of a junior clerk, and treated Deng Tuo's serious problem with only a perfunctory sentence. Isn't this too unfair to your boss? In the three pages of materials you painstakingly compiled, the secondary things, such as "praising long hair," "advocating keeping cats and dogs," "the older the art, the better," "promoting the leisure and elegance of feudal scholar-officials," "promoting feudal superstition," etc., etc., were placed in a very prominent and conspicuous position, occupying a large amount of space, while the most important thing about Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities was only excerpted a little, and placed in a very secondary position. What exactly are you doing with this practice of avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial, and turning big things into small things?
	"Frontline" and "Beijing Daily" also made a little so-called "self-criticism," saying that in the past, when they published articles by Deng Tuo and his gang, they "did not criticize them in time," but only because "there were influences of bourgeois and feudal class ideas in their minds," "they relaxed the class struggle on the cultural and academic front," "they did not implement proletarian politics in command," and "they lost their position or lost their vigilance." After reading your "self-criticism," we can't help but "burst out laughing," just as your Deng Tuo said. You have published so many articles by Deng Tuo and his gang for a long time, released so much poison, made such a mess, and became a tool for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Is just a little "influence of bourgeois and feudal class ideas" enough? After Wu Han's anti-Party face was greatly exposed, you even staged a farce of "Zhou Yu beating Huang Gai," publishing Xiang Yangsheng's, i.e. Deng Tuo's, fake criticism of Wu Han, and described Wu Han's monstrous anti-Party crimes as an academic issue of "moral inheritance theory," both exonerating Wu Han and protecting Deng Tuo from getting through. Even today, you are still continuing to play tricks and stubbornly resisting. Is this "losing your position or losing your vigilance," "relaxing the class struggle"? No! You have not lost your position, your position is very stable, but it is standing on the bourgeois position. You have not relaxed the class struggle, you have grasped the class struggle very tightly, but you are fighting against the proletariat.
	Where there are classes, there is class struggle, this is an inevitable law. It is not a bad thing to ferret out a small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements within us, but a great good thing, a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The slander and attacks of a small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are just the buzzing of a few flies, and do not detract from the great glory of our Party in the slightest. We want to solemnly warn those anti-Party and anti-socialist elements that it is you who have long since opened fire on the Party and socialism. "It is impolite not to reciprocate." We will certainly not let you go, we will certainly not let go of all the monsters and demons, we must fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end, and never stop until complete victory.

    向反党反社会主义的黑线开火
    高炬
    毛主席经常告诫我们：在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。在整个社会主义阶段，贯穿着社会主义和资本主义这两条道路的斗争。为了保证社会主义建设和防止资本主义复辟，必须在政治战线、经济战线、思想和文化战线上，把社会主义革命进行到底。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，千万不可忽视意识形态领域里的敌人，千万不要忘记阶级斗争。
    邓拓的《燕山夜话》，以及用吴（即吴晗）南（马南邨即邓拓）星（繁星即廖沫沙）署名写的《三家村札记》，充分说明了，在我们社会里，阶级斗争还是十分尖锐、复杂、激烈的。阶级敌人不仅从外部，而且从内部拚命地破坏和攻击我们。而一切反党反社会主义分子，他们攻击的矛头，总是对准我们的党和社会主义制度。
    邓拓是他和吴晗、廖沫沙开设的“三家村”黑店的掌柜，是这一小撮反党反社会主义分子的一个头目。他们把持《前线》、《北京日报》以及《北京晚报》作为反党工具，射出了大量毒箭，猖狂地向党向社会主义进攻。
    邓拓等一小撮人的反党反社会主义活动，绝不是偶然的孤立的现象。一九五八年，我国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党的总路线的指引下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，实现了全面大跃进。在政治、经济和思想文化战线上，以雷霆万钧之势，猛烈地冲击着资本主义和封建残余势力。在社会主义革命更加深入的情况下，党内的右倾机会主义分子适应帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内地、富、反、坏、右的需要，在一九五九年党的庐山会议上，向党展开了疯狂的进攻。在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，给了这些右倾机会主义分子以坚决的回击，缴了他们的“械”，罢了他们的官，彻底粉碎了他们的反党阴谋。随后，在一九五九年到一九六二年期间，由于连续几年严重自然灾害和赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者的破坏，我国遇到了暂时的经济困难。这时，国内外阶级敌人幸灾乐祸，纷纷出笼，党内右倾机会主义分子又和它们配合起来，向党发起了新的进攻。邓拓这一伙，就是在这种情况下，迫不及待“破门而出”的。
    对党和社会主义怀着刻骨仇恨的邓拓一伙，从一九六一年开始，就抛出了他们的《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》。他们以谈历史、传知识、讲故事、说笑话作幌子，借古讽今，指桑骂槐，含沙射影，旁敲侧击，对我们伟大的党进行了全面的恶毒的攻击。辱骂我们的党“狂热”、“发高烧”，说“伟大的空话”，害了“健忘症”。恶毒地攻击总路线、大跃进是“吹牛皮”，“想入非非”，“用空想代替了现实”，把“一个鸡蛋的家当”，“全部毁掉了”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”。竭力为罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，吹捧他们的反党“骨相”和“叛逆性格”，鼓励他们东山再起。诽谤无产阶级专政，极力煽动对社会主义制度的不满情绪，宣扬腐朽没落的封建道德和资产阶级思想，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。邓拓甚至狂妄地叫嚷要我们党赶快下台“休息”，什么话都不要说，什么事都不要做，一切听从他们的“指导”，由他们来专我们的政。
    请同志们回想一下，赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者不是骂过我们“说大话”，“吹牛皮”，大跃进是“冒险主义”吗？不是赞赏过我们党内的右倾机会主义分子“有足够的勇气”吗？邓拓反党反社会主义的叫嚣，和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对我们的污蔑和攻击，有什么两样呢！
    邓拓的《燕山夜话》，是地地道道的反党反社会主义的黑话。我们一定要抓住它，识破它，戳穿它，剥掉它的画皮，让邓拓这一小撮人反党反社会主义的丑恶面目，统统暴露在光天化日之下。欠债总是要还的。邓拓要想“瞒天过海”，要想“三十六计，走为上计”，是绝对办不到的。不仅邓拓滑不过去，他的同伙也滑不过去；不仅《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》要铲除掉，《海瑞罢官》、《李慧娘》、《谢瑶环》，以及《长短录》中的毒草，等等，凡是反党反社会主义的东西，都要一一铲除，毫不例外。
    特别值得注意的是，《北京日报》在四月十六日以三个版的篇幅，在《关于“三家村”和〈燕山夜话〉的批判》这个通栏大标题下，发表了一批材料，并发表了《前线》、《北京日报》的编者按。《前线》、《北京日报》长期以来，为吴晗等人打掩护，现在突然“积极”起来，急急忙忙抛出这一套东西，这究竟是怎么回事呢？他们是真的要“展开严肃的批判”吗？不，完全不是。这里面大有文章，大有奥妙。他们不过是借批判之名，行掩护之实，打起斗争的招牌，干着包庇的勾当。
    《前线》、《北京日报》的编者按，把邓拓这样一个反党反社会主义黑店的掌柜，放在了小伙计的地位，把邓拓这么严重的问题，只是不痛不痒地说了那么一句。这不是对你们这位掌柜太委屈了吗？你们煞费心机地编制的三个版的材料，把那些次要的东西，什么“赞美长发”呀，什么“提倡养猫养狗”呀，什么“艺术越古越好”呀，什么“宣扬封建士大夫的闲情逸致”呀，什么“提倡封建迷信”呀，等等，等等，放在非常突出显眼的地位，占了大量的篇幅，而对邓拓反党反社会主义最主要的东西，只摘录了一点点，并且放在很次要的地位。你们这种避重就轻、大事化小的做法，究竟是为了什么？
    《前线》、《北京日报》也做了一点所谓“检讨”，说什么过去发表邓拓等一伙人的文章，“没有及时地批判”，只是头脑中
  “有着资产阶级、封建阶级思想的影响”，“放松了文化学术战线上的阶级斗争”，“没有实行无产阶级政治挂帅”，“丧失立场或者丧失警惕”。我们读了你们这个“检讨”之后，正象你们邓拓所讲的，不禁使人“哑然失笑”。你们长期以来发表了邓拓一伙人那么多文章，放了那么多毒，搞得个乌烟瘴气，成为反党反社会主义的工具，仅仅一点“资产阶级、封建阶级思想的影响”够用吗？在吴晗反党面目大暴露之后，你们竟然还演出了一幕“周瑜打黄盖”的丑剧，发表了向阳生即邓拓对吴晗的假批判，把吴晗反党的滔天罪行，说成是什么“道德继承论”的学术问题，既为吴晗开脱，又保护邓拓过关。时至今日，你们还在继续玩弄花招，顽强抵抗。这难道是“丧失立场或者丧失警惕”、“放松阶级斗争”吗？不！你们并没有丧失立场，你们的立场站得很稳，不过是站在资产阶级的立场罢了。你们并没有放松阶级斗争，你们对阶级斗争抓得很紧，不过是对无产阶级进行斗争罢了。
    有阶级，就有阶级斗争，这是个必然的规律。在我们内部揪出一小撮反党反社会主义分子，不是坏事，而是一件大好事，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。一小撮反党反社会主义分子的污蔑和攻击，只不过是几个苍蝇嗡嗡叫而已，丝毫也无损于我们党的伟大光辉。我们要正告那些反党反社会主义分子，是你们早就向党向社会主义开了火。“来而不往，非礼也”。我们一定不会放过你们，一定不会放过一切牛鬼蛇神，一定要向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
