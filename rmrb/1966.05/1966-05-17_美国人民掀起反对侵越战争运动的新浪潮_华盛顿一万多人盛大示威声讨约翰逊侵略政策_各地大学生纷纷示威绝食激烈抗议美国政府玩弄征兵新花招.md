    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th Dispatch: Over ten thousand Americans held a march and demonstration in front of the White House on the 15th to oppose the Johnson administration's policy of aggression in Vietnam.

    In addition to Washington residents, participants in the march included Americans from eastern cities such as New York and from western and midwestern states. The massive procession of demonstrators took nearly two hours to pass the White House. Among them were white-haired elders and women pushing strollers. Demonstrators held up signs demanding "End the war in Vietnam."

    At the end of the march, demonstrators held a mass rally not far from the White House. Speakers at the rally pointed out that more and more Americans oppose the Johnson administration's policy of aggression in Vietnam. One speaker said, "The American war in Vietnam will be considered the most shameful war in American history."

    Throughout the demonstration, the US government dispatched a large number of police and secret agents to monitor and threaten the demonstrators.

    Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: College students across the United States held demonstrations on the 14th to protest the government authorities' manipulation of so-called "intelligence tests" as a new trick to send large numbers of college students to South Vietnam as cannon fodder.

    According to an order from the US Department of Defense, approximately 1,200 colleges and universities across the United States should conduct "intelligence tests" on nearly one million eligible college students within a month and a half starting on May 14; those with "poor" test scores will be drafted into the army first. This decision was met with fierce opposition from the majority of students as soon as it was announced.

    News from many cities in the United States indicates that students at many institutions of higher learning held various forms of protest demonstrations on the 14th. Some students also held collective hunger strikes to express their strong opposition to this despicable tactic by the government.

    After three consecutive days and nights of "sit-in" demonstrations, students at the University of Chicago immediately held demonstrations around the campus office building on the 14th and distributed leaflets opposing the American war of aggression in Vietnam. On the evening of the 13th, 350 students from this university also marched to the president's residence and presented him with a letter of protest.

    A group of students in Detroit held a two-hour demonstration on the 14th in support of the just actions of the students at the University of Chicago.

    Approximately sixty students at the City College of New York also demonstrated outside the "testing" site on the same day. They chanted anti-war slogans and distributed leaflets demanding that the United States immediately end the war of aggression in Vietnam.

    A group of students at the State University of New York at New Paltz held a protest demonstration on this day, and another ten students held a collective hunger strike in protest. The students said they would continue to demonstrate on the 16th.

    In addition, students at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Buffalo, and Princeton University also held demonstrations on this day.

    Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch: New York News: A group of students at the City University of New York held a demonstration on the 14th to oppose the Johnson administration's war of aggression in Vietnam.

    The demonstrators chanted slogans, held up signs, and distributed leaflets opposing the Johnson administration's driving American youth to serve as cannon fodder in the war of aggression in Vietnam. The demonstrators also held a sit-in demonstration on the evening of the 13th.

    In Oberlin, Ohio, about 250 students began a sit-in demonstration on the 14th. The demonstrators said they opposed conscription and protested the US government's policy toward Vietnam. (Attached picture)

    各地大学生纷纷示威绝食激烈抗议美国政府玩弄征兵新花招
    新华社十六日讯　华盛顿消息：一万多名美国人十五日在白宫前面举行游行示威，反对约翰逊政府侵略越南的政策。
    参加这次游行的除了华盛顿的市民外，还有来自纽约等美国东部城市和西部、中西部各州的美国人。示威群众的浩浩荡荡的队伍在白宫前面走了将近两个小时才走完。他们中有白发的老人，推着儿童手推车的妇女。示威者高举标语牌，要求“结束在越南的战争”。
    游行结束时，示威者在离白宫不远的地方举行了群众集会。会上发言的人指出，越来越多的美国人反对约翰逊政府侵略越南的政策。有一个发言者说，“美国在越南的战争将被认为是美国历史上最可耻的战争”。
    在整个示威过程中，美国政府派出了大批警察和密探对示威者进行监视和威胁。
    据新华社十六日讯　美国各地大学生十四日纷纷举行示威，抗议政府当局玩弄所谓“智力测验”的新花招，以便把大批大学生送往南越充当炮灰。
    根据美国国防部的命令，美国各地大约一千二百所大专学校应在五月十四日开始的一个半月内对将近一百万适龄大学生进行“智力测验”；凡测验成绩“较差”者将被尽先征召入伍。这个决定一经宣布就遭到了广大学生的激烈反对。
    来自美国许多城市的消息表明，许多高等院校的学生在十四日这一天分别举行了各种形式的抗议示威，一些学生还举行集体绝食，以表达他们对政府这种卑劣手段的强烈反对。
    芝加哥大学的学生在连续三天三夜的“静坐”示威以后，紧接着在十四日又在校内办公大楼周围举行示威，并且散发了反对美国侵越战争的传单。十三日晚上，这个大学的三百五十名学生还列队前往校长的住所，向他递交了抗议信。
    底特律一批学生十四日举行了两小时示威，声援芝加哥大学学生的正义行动。
    纽约市立学院的大约六十名学生同一天也在“测验”场所外边示威。他们齐声高呼反战口号，并且散发了要求美国立即结束侵越战争的传单。
    纽约州纽帕尔茨市州立大学分校的一批学生这一天举行了抗议示威，另外还有十名学生集体绝食以示抗议。学生们表示他们将在十六日继续示威。

    新华社十五日讯　纽约消息：纽约市立大学的一批学生十四日举行示威，反对约翰逊政府侵越战争。
