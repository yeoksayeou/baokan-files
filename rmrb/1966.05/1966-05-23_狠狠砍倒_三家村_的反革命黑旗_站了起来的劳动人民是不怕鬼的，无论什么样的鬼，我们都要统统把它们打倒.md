    Resolutely Chop Down the Anti-Revolutionary Black Flag of the "Three-Family Village"
    The Laboring People Who Have Stood Up Are Not Afraid of Ghosts, No Matter What Kind of Ghosts They Are, We Must Overthrow Them All
    Representative of the National People's Congress, "Mother of the Soldiers" Rong Guanxiu
    Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist." This is absolutely true. Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han, these fellows, wearing red hats and waving black flags, seizing the seals of power on the cultural front, and using "Qianxian," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" as tools, actively cleared the way for counter-revolutionary restoration. These fellows are even more insidious and vicious than enemies with real guns and knives. They kill without knives, kill without bloodshed, fire black guns behind our backs, and undermine the socialist cause.
    We laboring people are the creators of the world. We are at the forefront in the struggle for production, and we must also be at the forefront in the Great Cultural Revolution. In the evil old society, I suffered the most and was oppressed the most severely. In that cannibalistic old society, there was no way for us poor people to survive. My parents did heavy labor for the landlords, but still could not support our three children. We had to beg for food with sticks. My father had no choice but to sell me for fifteen strings of cash. After that, I went from this landlord's house to that landlord's house, working like a cow or a horse. I remember when I gave birth to my eldest son, Chun Jing, the landlord's family also gave birth to a son on the same day. They forced me not to give my child milk, but to give milk to their son, giving me only one *dou* of corn a year, and it was rotten. Unable to survive, I had to cultivate some wasteland on the mountain, but who knew that the mountain at that time also belonged to the "rich," and half of the grain harvested had to be handed over to the landlord. I lived like this for forty-two years.
    I don't know how many people had a family history of blood and tears like mine in the old society.
    After the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came here, they implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, distributed land, struggled against landlords, and established mutual aid teams. The poor and lower-middle peasants became the masters of the house. After the liberation of the whole country, I, an old woman of seventy, was also elected as a representative to the National People's Congress, discussing national affairs with the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We embarked on the socialist road, and the village has undergone earth-shattering changes. In the past, there was no paddy field. Now, 85% of the dry land has been turned into paddy field, and the yield per *mu* has increased from 40 or 50 *jin* in the past to more than 450 *jin* now. Pingshan County is a large mountainous area. Now the people have changed, the land has changed, and the high barren land since ancient times has become paddy field. Many production teams with a yield of more than 800 *jin* per *mu* have emerged. The mountain roads that could not be traveled by people in the past are now accessible by cars in all directions, and 60% of the mountain villages have installed electric lights. Aren't all these great achievements made under the glorious illumination of the General Line? We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, understand the suffering of the old society best, and we also understand the sweetness of the new society best. Deng Tuo, you small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, vainly attempt to turn the wheel of history backward and drag us back to the old road of being exploited and oppressed. This is ten million times impossible! We are determined to chop down your black flag and uproot your poisonous weeds.
    Deng Tuo, you and your gang are rotten to the core, with sores on your head and pus flowing from the soles of your feet. You eat the people's food and wear the people's clothes, but you are ungrateful, anti-Party and anti-people, and oppose the Great Leap Forward. The laboring people who have stood up are not afraid of ghosts. No matter what kind of ghosts they are, we must overthrow them all. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight against the demons and monsters, fight against imperialism and revisionism, and send them all to the grave.

### 狠狠砍倒“三家村”的反革命黑旗  站了起来的劳动人民是不怕鬼的，无论什么样的鬼，我们都要统统把它们打倒

    狠狠砍倒“三家村”的反革命黑旗
    站了起来的劳动人民是不怕鬼的，无论什么样的鬼，我们都要统统把它们打倒
    全国人民代表大会代表、“子弟兵的母亲”　戎冠秀
    毛主席说过：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”。这真是一点也不差。邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗这些家伙，戴着红帽子，打着黑旗子，抓着文化战线的印把子，以《前线》《北京日报》和《北京晚报》为工具，积极为反革命复辟鸣锣开道。这些家伙比拿真刀真枪的敌人还阴险毒辣，他们杀人不用刀，杀人不见血，在我们背后放黑枪，破坏社会主义事业。
    我们劳动人民是世界的创造者，在生产斗争中是打头阵的，在文化大革命中也要打头阵。我在万恶的旧社会，受的苦最深，受的压迫最厉害。在那吃人的旧社会，根本没有我们穷人的活路，父母给地主扛大活，仍然维持不了我们三个孩子的生活。我们只好拉着棍子要饭，父亲没办法，十五吊钱就把我卖了。以后我就从这家地主到那家地主，做牛做马。记得我生下大儿子春景的时候，地主家也在同一天生了个儿子，他们逼着我不给孩子吃奶，而给他家的儿子吃奶，一年只给一斗玉米，还是霉烂的。我生活不下去，只好在山上开点荒地，谁知那时的山也姓“富”，收的粮食也得交地主一半。这样的生活我整整过了四十二年。
    象我这样的血泪家史，在旧社会不知有多少呢。
    我们这里来了共产党、八路军以后，实行减租减息，分田地，斗地主，办互助组，贫下中农当了家，成了主人。全国解放后，我这个七十岁的老人还被选为全国人民代表大会代表，同党中央和毛主席共议国家大事。我们走上了社会主义道路，村里起了翻天覆地的变化。过去没有水地，现在百分之八十五的旱地变成了水地，亩产粮食由过去的四五十斤上升到现在的四百五十多斤。我们平山县是个大山区，现在人变了，地变了，自古以来的高岗旱地变成了水地，出现了许多亩产八百斤以上的生产队，过去不能行人的山路，现在汽车四通八达，百分之六十的山庄安上了电灯。所有这些，不都是在总路线的光辉照耀下所取得的伟大成绩吗？我们广大贫下中农最懂得旧社会的苦，也最懂得新社会的甜。邓拓，你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，妄想倒转历史车轮，把我们再拉回受剥削、受压迫的老路上去，这是千万个万万个办不到！我们坚决要把你们的黑旗砍倒，把你们的毒草连根拔掉。
    邓拓你们这一伙，头顶长疮，脚心里流脓，坏透了。你们吃着人民的，穿着人民的，却忘恩负义，反党反人民，反对大跃进。站起来了的劳动人民是不怕鬼的，无论什么样的鬼，我们统统都要把它们打倒。我们广大贫下中农，一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同牛鬼蛇神斗，同帝国主义、修正主义斗，把它们统统送进坟墓。
