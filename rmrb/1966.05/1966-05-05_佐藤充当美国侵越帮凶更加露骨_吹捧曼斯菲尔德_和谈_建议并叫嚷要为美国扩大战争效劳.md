    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 28th – Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, in speeches at plenary sessions of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives on April 28th, twice indicated that he would actively serve the U.S. in promoting its new "peace talk" fraud on the Vietnam issue, and act as an apologist for the U.S. in expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Sato said: "I wholeheartedly welcome (U.S. Senator) Mansfield's proposal for holding a peace conference to resolve the Vietnam issue. It is extremely important to get the countries concerned to agree to this proposal, and Japan will work to achieve this goal in the future."
    In his "peace talk" proposal, Mansfield regarded Japan as a "best possible" location for "peace talks." Sato acknowledged that he had assured U.S. Vice President Humphrey, who visited Japan, that he would serve the "peace talks" proposed by the U.S.
    In his speech, Sato also indicated that he was faithfully serving the U.S. in expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. He said: "I maintain that while enjoying the rights of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan should faithfully fulfill its obligations (to the U.S.)." Sato also said: "The U.S. has administrative rights in Okinawa, and it doesn't matter how it uses the bases there." He also stated that Japan "does not intend to stop" assisting the South Vietnamese puppet clique. Sato once again defended U.S. imperialism's armed aggression against Vietnam, absurdly claiming that this was a "military action" taken by the U.S. at the "request" of the Saigon regime, and that the Saigon regime was "defending its own independence and security." He even defended U.S. imperialism's crime of barbarously using poison gas to slaughter the Vietnamese people, ridiculously saying that "the poison gas the U.S. is using in Vietnam is the same as that used by the police, and is not deadly."
    Sato made these remarks in response to urgent inquiries from Socialist Party members Shigeo Tsubaki and Hideichi Yanagida. They pointed out that the Sato government's cooperation with the U.S. on the aggression against Vietnam has brought Japan to the brink of war. This perverse behavior completely violates the will of the Japanese people. They demanded that the Sato government refuse the U.S. use of Okinawa and mainland Japan to carry out the war of aggression against Vietnam, and completely change the Japanese government's position of colluding with the U.S. to "contain" China and joining the U.S. strategic system in the Asia-Pacific region.

    佐藤充当美国侵越帮凶更加露骨
    吹捧曼斯菲尔德“和谈”建议并叫嚷要为美国扩大战争效劳
    新华社东京电　日本内阁首相佐藤荣作四月二十八日在参议院和众议院的全体会议上，两次发言表示要积极为美国推销在越南问题上的新“和谈”骗局效劳，并且充当美国扩大侵略越南战争的辩护士。
    佐藤说：“我从心里欢迎
  （美国参议员）曼斯菲尔德关于举行解决越南问题的和平会议的建议。使有关各国赞同这一建议极为重要，今后日本要为实现这一目的而努力。
    曼斯菲尔德在他的“和谈”建议中，把日本作为一个“最好不过的”“和谈”地点。佐藤承认他曾向访问日本的美国副总统汉弗莱保证要为美国提出的“和谈”效劳。
    佐藤在发言中同时表示他也忠实地为美国扩大侵略越南战争效劳。他说：“我主张日本在享受日美安全条约的权利的同时，应当忠实地（对美国）尽自己的义务。”佐藤还说：“美国在冲绳具有施政权，不论怎样利用那里的基地都没关系”。他还表示日本“不打算停止”援助南越傀儡集团。佐藤又一次为美帝国主义武装侵略越南辩解，说什么这是美国应西贡政权的“请求”采取的“军事行动”，而西贡政权是“为了保卫自己的独立和安全”。他甚至替美帝国主义野蛮地使用毒气屠杀越南人民的罪行辩护，荒诞地说什么“美国正在越南使用的毒气，是同警察使用的一样，不是致人死命的。”
    佐藤是在回答社会党议员椿繁夫、柳田秀一的紧急质询时发表这篇谈话的。他们指出，佐藤政府同美国在侵略越南问题上合作，已经使日本面临战争危险的边缘。这种倒行逆施的行为完全违反了日本人民的意志。他们要求佐藤政府拒绝美国使用冲绳和日本本土去进行侵略越南的战争，彻底改变日本政府伙同美国“遏制”中国和加入美国在亚洲太平洋地区的战略体制的立场。
