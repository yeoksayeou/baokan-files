    Western European Public Opinion Exclaims that China's Nuclear Development Speed Exceeds that of the West and the Soviet Union
    Acknowledging that China's Prestige in the World Has Increased Further
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th - Some Western European countries' bourgeois press admitted that China's successful third nuclear explosion broke the US-Soviet nuclear monopoly, causing "shockwaves around the world" and increasing China's prestige throughout the world. West Germany's *Die Welt* pointed out in an editorial on the 11th that China's nuclear explosion "is increasingly dispelling the unreliable prospect of preventing nuclear proliferation and maintaining the US-Soviet monopoly." The newspaper believes that China's third explosion "caused shockwaves around the world" and demonstrated China's "rapid progress" in this area.
    A news item from Deutsche Presse-Agentur on the 10th admitted that China's successful third nuclear explosion meant its "remarkable victory in the world's prestige." The news said: "China's recent nuclear test is also a tremendous achievement by Chinese scientists, who, after the withdrawal of Soviet nuclear experts, relied solely on their own strength to advance nuclear research without any foreign assistance. Furthermore, this third test is another important step for Beijing on its path to becoming a world power, and its voice can no longer be ignored."
    West Berlin's *Der Tagesspiegel* said that the success of this explosion illustrates China's "economic strength, political willpower, and a certain level of industrial development." The newspaper believes that what is more important is "the speed at which the Chinese are moving forward."
    Switzerland's *Tribune de Genève* also published an article on the 10th, saying, "The progress of the People's China in the atomic race is extraordinarily rapid and astonishing," and "the assumptions made by the West regarding the timeframe of China's nuclear program (the so-called timeframe required due to technical requirements) have been negated by the course of events." Switzerland's *Neue Zürcher Zeitung* wrote on the 11th that it was astonishing that "in producing their nuclear weapons, the Chinese took a completely different path from the Americans."
    Swedish Television commented on China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials, saying that the "political significance is very significant," and "technically it is also a major achievement." The television station pointed out that the time China took from the atomic bomb to the successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials was "shorter than the United States took back then."
    A commentary in Sweden's *Dagens Nyheter* said, "It is clear that China is continuing to develop into a nuclear power, at a speed that is much faster than generally estimated by people in Western countries and the Soviet Union."

    西欧舆论惊呼我国核发展速度超过西方和苏联
    承认中国在世界的威望更加提高了
    新华社十四日讯　西欧一些国家的资产阶级报界承认，中国第三次核爆炸成功，打破了美苏核垄断，引起了“世界范围的震动”，提高了中国在全世界的威望。西德《世界报》十一日在社论中指出，中国的核爆炸，“使防止核扩散、保持美苏垄断地位的靠不住的前景，愈来愈烟消云散了”。这家报纸认为，中国的第三次爆炸“引起了世界范围的震动”，表明了中国在这方面的“迅速的进步”。
    德意志新闻社十日在一条消息中承认，中国第三次核爆炸成功意味着它“在世界上的威望的令人注目的胜利”。消息说：“中国最近的核试验，也是中国的科学家们，在苏联核专家撤退后，在没有任何外国援助的情况下，只依靠自己的力量，推进核研究的巨大成就。此外，这第三次试验，对北京来说，是它在成为一个世界强国的道路上又迈出的重要一步，它的声音不再能充耳不闻了。”
    西柏林的《每日镜报》说，这次爆炸的成功说明了中国的“经济能力、政治意志力量和一定的工业发展水平”。这家报纸认为，更重要的是“中国人在以怎样的速度向前进”。
    瑞士的《日内瓦论坛报》十日也发表文章说，“人民中国在原子竞赛中的进展是格外迅速的和令人惊异的”，“西方作出的关于中国核计划的期限（所谓由于技术要求而必须的期限）的假设被事态的演变所否定了”。瑞士《联邦报》十一日还写道，令人惊讶的是，“在生产他们的核武器方面，中国人走了完全不同于美国人的路。”
    瑞典电视台就中国进行含有热核材料的核爆炸成功发表评论说，这个成就的“政治意义十分重大”，而且“在技术上也是个重大成就”。电视台指出，中国从原子弹到这次含有热核材料的核爆炸成功，所经历的时间“比美国当年短”。
    瑞典《每日新闻报》的评论说，“很明显，中国正在继续向核大国发展，在速度上比西方国家和苏联的人们的一般估计要快得多。”
