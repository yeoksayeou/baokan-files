    一位观众说通过表演看到了伟大的中国革命
    新华社阿尔及尔十九日电  中国太原杂技团十九日晚上在这里演出，受到八百多名观众的热烈欢迎。
    一位阿尔及利亚记者对新华社记者说，“通过中国艺术家，我们看到了伟大的中国人民和伟大的中国革命。”
    中国太原杂技团在阿尔及利亚全国各地进行了一个月的巡回演出之后，十七日到达这里。这是他们在首都阿尔及尔的第一次正式公演。
    中国艺术家的每一个节目都受到热烈欢迎。观众不断发出喝采声和掌声。观众往往用“精采”、“难以想象”等词句来称赞精采的表演。许多观众说，他们到这里来欣赏杂技艺术，是因为他们听说杂技团来自中国，而且表演十分精采。
    在杂技团到达这里的前夕，阿尔及利亚广播电台和电视台以及这里的各家报纸对太原杂技团和中国的杂技艺术作了介绍。
    杂技团将在首都再演三场，然后到阿尔及利亚东部继续访问演出。
