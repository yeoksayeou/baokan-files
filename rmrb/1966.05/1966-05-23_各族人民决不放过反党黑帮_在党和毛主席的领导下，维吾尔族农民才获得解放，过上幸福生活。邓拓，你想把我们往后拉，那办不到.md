    People of All Nationalities Will Never Let Go of the Anti-Party Gang
    Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, Uyghur farmers were liberated and are living a happy life. Deng Tuo, you want to drag us backward, that won't work!
    Ayufu, Member of the Poor Peasants Association of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Vice Chairman of the Poor Peasants Association of Turpan County
    Deng Tuo, this bad guy, madly opposes the Party, opposes Chairman Mao, opposes socialism, and opposes us poor and lower-middle peasants and the people of the whole country. What he said is exactly the same as what the landlords said. The landlords said the Great Leap Forward couldn't be done, Deng Tuo said the Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "talking big"; the landlords said we were like chicken feathers that couldn't fly to the sky, Deng Tuo said we "destroyed the entire possessions of an egg." I was very angry when I heard this. Let me use the facts to shut this bad egg's mouth.
    I am seventy-four years old this year. Before liberation, I ran all over Turpan and worked as a long-term hired hand for ten landlords for decades. My parents also worked as long-term hired hands for landlords, and I was born in a landlord's cowshed. Before liberation, my family didn't have a room, didn't have an acre of land, and never ate enough. After liberation, we became masters of our own affairs, and life got better year by year, especially since the Great Leap Forward, life has gotten even better. In 1958, I deposited 1,500 yuan in the bank for the first time and built three new houses, and now I have two more houses under construction. Deng Tuo said we had "the possessions of an egg" and were "destroyed" in the Great Leap Forward, which is completely nonsense!
    Before liberation, Turpan suffered from drought every year. Landlords used the peasants' desire for water to incite peasants to fight for water with weapons, and many peasant brothers were killed every year. After liberation, Turpan's water conservancy became better year by year, especially since the Great Leap Forward. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole county dug three large canals all at once, and the snow water of the Tianshan Mountains flowed in, flowing into the interior of the Turpan Basin for the first time, and could irrigate 1,500 acres of land overnight. With water, the people of the whole county reclaimed wasteland every year, reclaiming tens of thousands of acres of land. The Targai Gobi used to be full of camel thorns, desolate and terrifying, but now it is crisscrossed with fertile fields and shaded by grapevines, as beautiful as Grape Valley. Since the Great Leap Forward, the county's grain production has increased year after year, and cotton production has also continued to increase. In our Wuxing Brigade alone, the grain production in 1965 was twice as much as in 1958. I want to ask Deng Tuo: the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune have achieved such great results, why are they not good? The rapid development of our county, our autonomous region, and our country is a fact. Are we "bragging" and "talking big," or are you intentionally opposing the Party and opposing socialism, closing your eyes and not seeing the facts? Deng Tuo and his gang are opposing the general line, opposing the Great Leap Forward, opposing the people's commune, and opposing the rapid construction of a strong socialist country by the people of the whole country; they are telling us to abandon the lofty ideals of building communism, telling us to follow behind imperialism and modern revisionism, and begging for food from them; they are telling us to go back to the old society, and telling us working people to be poor and oppressed forever.
    In the old society, many peasants who made revolution were killed by the reactionaries, their heads fell to the ground, and blood flowed like rivers. Only under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao did the Uyghur farmers gain liberation and live a happy life. Deng Tuo wants to drag us backwards, which is simply impossible! Deng Tuo, I warn you, you are anti-Party and anti-socialist, we poor and lower-middle peasants cannot let you go, and the people of all nationalities in the country cannot let you go!

    各族人民决不放过反党黑帮
    在党和毛主席的领导下，维吾尔族农民才获得解放，过上幸福生活。邓拓，你想把我们往后拉，那办不到
    新疆维吾尔自治区贫协委员吐鲁番县贫协副主席  阿尤甫
    邓拓这个坏家伙疯狂地反对党、反对毛主席、反对社会主义、反对我们贫下中农和全国人民。他说的话，和地主说的话一模一样。地主说大跃进办不到，邓拓说大跃进是“吹牛皮”“说大话”；地主说我们是鸡毛上不了天，邓拓说我们把“一个鸡蛋的家当”“全部毁掉了”。我听了十分气愤。让我用事实来封住这个坏蛋的嘴巴。
    我今年七十四岁了。解放前，跑遍吐鲁番，给十家地主扛了几十年长工。我的父辈也是给地主家扛长工，我就是在地主家的牛屋里生下来的。解放前，我家没有一间房，没有一亩地，从来没有吃饱过肚子。解放后，我们当家作了主人，生活一年比一年好，特别是大跃进以来，生活更好。一九五八年，我头一次在银行存了一千五百块钱，盖了三间新房，现在还有两间房子正在盖。邓拓说我们是“一个鸡蛋的家当”，在大跃进中“毁掉了”，完全是胡说！
    解放前，吐鲁番年年遭旱，地主利用农民渴望得到水的心情，挑拨农民争水械斗，哪年不打死好些农民兄弟。解放后，吐鲁番水利一年比一年办得好，特别是大跃进以来，全县人民在党的领导下，一下子挖了三条大渠，天山雪水滚滚而来，第一次流进了吐鲁番盆地的腹部，一夜可以浇一千五百亩地。有了水，全县人民年年开荒，开了几万亩地。塔尔珈戈壁过去遍地骆驼刺，荒凉可怕，现在是良田纵横，葡萄成荫，简直和葡萄沟一样美丽。大跃进以来，全县粮食年年增产，棉花产量也不断增加，仅我们五星大队，一九六五年的粮食就比一九五八年增加两倍。我要质问邓拓：总路线、大跃进、人民公社取得了这样大的成绩，为什么不好？我们县、我们自治区、我们国家的飞跃发展，事实俱在，是我们“吹牛皮”“说大话”，还是你们存心反党反社会主义，闭眼不看事实？邓拓这一伙人就是反对总路线，反对大跃进，反对人民公社，反对全国人民迅速建设强大的社会主义国家；就是叫我们放弃建设共产主义的远大理想，叫我们跟在帝国主义、现代修正主义后面跑，从它们手里讨饭吃；就是叫我们回到旧社会去，叫我们劳动人民永远受穷受压迫。
    在旧社会，许多农民闹革命都被反动派杀害了，人头落地，血流成河。只是在党和毛主席领导下，维吾尔族农民才获得解放，过上幸福生活。邓拓想把我们拉向后退，这根本办不到！邓拓，我警告你，你反党反社会主义，我们贫下中农不能放过你，全国各族人民不能放过你！
