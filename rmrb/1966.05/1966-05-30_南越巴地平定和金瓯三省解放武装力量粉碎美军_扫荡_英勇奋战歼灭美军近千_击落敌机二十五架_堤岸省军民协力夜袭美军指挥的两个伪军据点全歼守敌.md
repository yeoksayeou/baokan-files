    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Ba Dinh Province, South Vietnam, completely crushed the "sweep" conducted by 5,000 US invading troops against Long Phu Commune, Long Thanh District, in six days from the 16th to the 21st. They annihilated 667 US troops, shot down 8 enemy helicopters, and destroyed 2 enemy military vehicles.

    In the first four days of the battle, the Liberation Armed Forces bravely repelled multiple enemy attacks, annihilating more than 300 enemies and shooting down four helicopters.

    On the 20th, the battle intensified, and the Liberation Armed Forces bravely repelled 25 enemy attacks on the commune, killing and wounding nearly 200 enemies. On May 21st, the enemy, unwilling to admit defeat, launched another attack, but was again repelled by the Liberation Armed Forces. More than 100 US invading troops were annihilated, and four helicopters were shot down. That same evening, the Liberation Armed Forces took advantage of the victory to launch a surprise attack on the US invading troops' campsite, which had already been beaten into a state of disarray and fear, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 29th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Thua Thien Province, South Vietnam, with the assistance of the local people, launched fierce attacks on the Duc Hue Military Sub-district Command and the Xiehe stronghold, directly commanded by the US invaders, late on the night of May 26th.

    According to preliminary reports, after only one hour of combat, the Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated the enemy troops at both locations and seized all weapons, ammunition, and military supplies. According to another report from the Liberation News Agency, guerrillas in the northern area of Bien Cat District, Thu Dau Mot Province, closely coordinated their operations during the period from May 9th to 14th, continuously intercepting and attacking the enemy, thwarting the "sweep" launched by more than 3,000 US invading troops, eliminating 82 enemies, and shooting down five helicopters.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 29th – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of Binh Dinh and Kim Ou provinces in South Vietnam fiercely attacked the enemy in mid-May, annihilating a total of more than 600 enemies, including more than 300 US invading troops, shooting down 17 enemy aircraft, and destroying five enemy M-113 amphibious armored vehicles.

    From May 11th to May 19th, the US First Cavalry Division used helicopters to transport three battalions of troops, under the cover of artillery and armored vehicles, to "sweep" through the counties of Hoai An, Phu Cat, and Vinh Thanh in Binh Dinh Province. The Liberation Armed Forces of Hoai An County immediately launched a fierce attack when the enemy's helicopters had just landed, killing more than 90 enemies and wounding many others on the spot, and shooting down 12 helicopters.

    The military and civilians of Vinh Thanh County also engaged in fierce battles with the US invading troops and intercepted the enemy's reinforcements, annihilating more than 200 enemies in one fell swoop.

    This is another new victory for the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province after smashing the large-scale "sweep" of the US First Cavalry Division in the San Guan area on May 5th and 6th, achieving a great victory of annihilating more than 500 enemies.

    In Kim Ou Province, the enemy dispatched 2,000 puppet troops on May 14th, divided into three routes, to launch a frenzied attack on Xin Xie Commune, attempting to relieve the enemy in the Tan Ren Military Sub-district, which was heavily surrounded by the military and civilians of Tan Ren County. The local Liberation Armed Forces had long been waiting in full battle array. As soon as the enemy entered Xin Xie Commune, they were immediately met with a head-on blow. The fierce battle continued from 1:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. that day, and the Liberation Armed Forces killed and wounded nearly 300 enemies, completely crushing the enemy's attack.

    堤岸省军民协力夜袭美军指挥的两个伪军据点全歼守敌
    新华社二十九日讯　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方巴地省解放武装力量从十六日到二十一日的六天中，彻底粉碎了五千名美国侵略军对隆成县隆福乡进行的“扫荡”，歼灭美军六百六十七名，击落敌直升飞机八架，击毁敌军车两辆。
    在战斗开始的头四天中，解放武装力量英勇地击退了敌人的多次进攻，歼敌三百多名，击落直升飞机四架。
    二十日，战斗转趋激烈，解放武装力量奋勇击退了敌人对这个乡发动的二十五次进攻，打死、打伤敌人将近二百名。五月二十一日，敌人还不死心，再次发动进攻，但又被解放武装力量击退。一百多名美国侵略军被歼灭，四架直升飞机被击落。解放武装力量还在当天晚上，乘胜对已经被打得狼狈不堪、胆战心惊的美国侵略军的野营发动突然袭击，又大量杀伤敌人。
    据新华社河内二十九日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方堤岸省解放武装力量在当地人民的协助下，五月二十六日深夜向美国侵略者直接指挥的德惠军事支区指挥所和协和据点发动猛烈袭击。
    据初步消息，仅经过一小时的战斗，解放武装力量就全歼了这两处的敌军，并缴获所有武器、弹药和军用物资。另据解放通讯社报道，土龙木省边葛县北部地区的游击队，在五月九日至十四日期间，紧密配合作战，连续截击和袭击敌人，挫败了三千多名美国侵略军发动的“扫荡”，消灭敌人八十二名，击落直升飞机五架。
    据新华社河内二十九日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定和金瓯两省军民五月中旬猛烈打击敌人，共歼灭敌人六百多名，其中包括美国侵略军三百多名，击落敌机十七架，击毁敌M—113型两栖装甲车五辆。
    从五月十一日到五月十九日，美国第一骑兵师用直升飞机装运了三个营的兵力，在大炮和装甲车的掩护下，到平定省怀恩、符吉和永盛等县“扫荡”。怀恩县解放武装力量在敌人的直升飞机刚刚着陆的时候，就立即给以猛烈的打击，当场打死敌人九十多名，打伤多名，击落直升飞机十二架。
    永盛县军民也同美国侵略军展开了激烈的战斗，同时截击敌人的援军，一举歼敌二百多名。
    这是平定省军民继五月五日和六日在三关地区粉碎美国第一骑兵师的大规模“扫荡”，取得歼敌五百多名的巨大战果之后又一次新的胜利。
    在金瓯省，敌人在五月十四日出动了二千名伪军，分成三路向新协乡发动猖狂进攻，妄图给被潭惹县军民重重包围的潭惹军事支区的敌人解围。当地解放武装力量早已严阵以待。敌人刚刚进入新协乡就立即遭到迎头痛击。激烈的战斗从当天下午一时一直继续到傍晚七时，解放武装力量共打死、打伤敌人近三百名，彻底粉碎了敌人的这次进攻。
