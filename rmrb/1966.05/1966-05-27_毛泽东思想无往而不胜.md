    Mao Zedong Thought is Invincible
    Experiences of learning Chairman Mao's writings summarized by leading cadres of a division in the Nanjing Military Region:
    With revolutionary spirit, firmly believe that Mao Zedong Thought is invincible; with revolutionary spirit, adhere to high standards and strict requirements in transforming thought and guiding work; with revolutionary spirit, adhere to the unity of theory and practice, learn in practice, learn from the masses, and break away from the bookishness in learning methods.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th – Leading cadres at the division and regiment levels of a certain unit in the Nanjing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have deeply realized in their study of Chairman Mao's writings that: to make great efforts in "application" in studying Chairman Mao's works, one must, with revolutionary spirit, firmly believe that Mao Zedong Thought is invincible; one must, with revolutionary spirit, adhere to high standards and strict requirements in transforming thought and guiding work; one must, with revolutionary spirit, adhere to the unity of theory and practice, learn in practice, learn from the masses, and break away from the bookishness in learning methods.
    The leading cadres of this unit have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a flexible way for a relatively long time, and they have a lot of experience, as well as some lessons. A few months ago, they held an enlarged Party committee meeting, pooled their wisdom, and summarized some experiences in studying Chairman Mao's writings and making great efforts in "application."
    Their first experience is: only by firmly believing can one be determined, and only by daring to use can one know how to use. They said: We are not afraid of not knowing how to use it, but of not daring to use it; only by daring to use it can we know how to use it. How well it is used depends first and foremost on the revolutionary consciousness. The question of whether or not to dare to use it is essentially whether or not one firmly believes that Mao Zedong Thought will be effective once used, will be effective again when used again, and will be effective wherever it is used. Use it not only in normal circumstances, but also in difficult tasks, tight deadlines, and other critical moments. They believe that critical moments are the moments when Mao Zedong Thought is most needed, and are also the moments when it is easiest to "turn." The Party committee of a certain regiment in this unit has a deep understanding of this issue. They undertook a production task last year and received the task of accumulating 270,000 dan of fertilizer before the end of March, but by mid-March they had only completed 130,000 dan. Therefore, some people criticized them, saying: "Studying Chairman Mao's writings and political education take up too much time, grinding the sickle without cutting the grass, and there is no way to explain it." What to do? The Party committee of a certain regiment firmly believed that the more this was the case, the more necessary it was to apply Mao Zedong Thought, and only by applying Mao Zedong Thought could difficulties be turned into smooth progress and passivity into initiative. Therefore, in the only ten days or so of production time, they took out two days to study Chairman Mao's thesis of "overcoming all difficulties to win victory" with the troops. Facts once again proved that Mao Zedong Thought is effective once used. After studying, the revolutionary heroism of the troops was greatly developed. They said: "One is not a true man if he does not reach the Great Wall, and one will not be satisfied unless he wins 140,000 dan of fertilizer!" As a result, they accumulated 240,000 dan of fertilizer in ten days or so, exceeding the original target by 100,000 dan.
    To dare to use means to resolutely use it even when the results are temporarily not improving. Another regiment was a unit that studied relatively well in the entire division, and had participated in the Nanjing Military Region's conference of activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings, especially the regimental commander, who not only studied well himself, but also guided the troops well in their studies. However, shooting training results were once less than ideal. At this time, some people complained that he was "not doing his job properly," saying: "What's the use of studying so well if the training results don't improve?" But he withstood the pressure, firmly believing that he was taking the right path, and would rather be a "political regimental commander," making the unit's politics strong, able to charge and defend in battle, and would never be a "purely military regimental commander," focusing solely on training "results." The regimental Party committee also firmly believed that if Mao Zedong Thought was truly used well, and there were spiritual results, material results would eventually emerge. They tightened their grip on the study of Chairman Mao's writings, and as a result, the unit's political atmosphere became more intense, and training results gradually improved. They deeply realized: "We are not afraid of not being able to use it, but of changing direction; we are not afraid of not having results, but of not persisting."
    In addition to the above two situations, they also realized that to dare to use means to resolutely use it when problems arise in the troops; even if it is not used well for a while, or even if some mistakes are made, one must still persist in using it. In short, in any case, one must firmly and unremittingly believe in Mao Zedong Thought. Daring to apply Mao Zedong Thought in any situation is a high degree of responsibility to the Party, the people, and the revolution. Therefore, one must not be afraid of taking risks, not be afraid of making mistakes, eliminate all selfish ideas and distracting thoughts, and break down all erroneous ideas that hinder the application of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Their second experience is: use Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints to solve the main problems that urgently need to be solved.
    They said: There are many problems to be addressed in studying Chairman Mao's writings. Some are specific, some are common; some are major, some are minor; some are urgent, some are gradual. These problems cannot all be solved at once in the same time period, but the main problems that are universally and urgently needed to be solved must be solved first. Once a main problem that urgently needs to be solved is solved, another main problem that urgently needs to be solved is solved. By persisting in this way for a long time, we can not only solve practical problems immediately, but also gradually solve fundamental problems systematically.
    At one time, the leading group of this unit underwent great changes, with some being transferred out, some being transferred in, and some being newly promoted, and the tasks they were responsible for were also new. Under the conditions of new tasks and new teams, they believed that they should not lower requirements or standards, but should do a better job. But the problem they encountered was that the ideological level of the leaders could not keep up with the needs of the development of the situation, and they were often willing but not able to do so. Without improving the ideological level of the leaders, even the best revolutionary aspirations would not be easy to realize. Therefore, they decided to solve this problem first. Chairman Mao said: "Correct ideas of people can only come from social practice, can only come from the three practices of social production struggle, class struggle and scientific experiment." Chairman Mao's teachings made them further understand that the ideological level and work experience of leaders can only be improved and enriched through continuous practice, and that doing revolution is often not learning well and then doing it, but doing it and then learning, and doing is learning. Therefore, they went to the companies to stay, pilot, and investigate, and for a time there was a trend of "eating pears" and "seizing the two rights" (having the right to speak and the right to lead after investigation and research). In this way, the ideological level of the division and regiment leaders was improved, the guidance of various tasks was relatively solid, and better results were also achieved. In the face of achievements, some comrades exposed the signs of being content with the status quo, and they were satisfied with general enthusiasm, general leadership, and general completion of tasks. The division and regiment Party committees believed that if this obstacle was not removed, not only would they not be able to continue to advance, but even the achievements already made would be difficult to maintain. Therefore, they repeatedly studied the viewpoint of one divides into two, broke the "three generals" (general enthusiasm, general leadership, general completion of tasks), and established the "four somethings" (something discovered, something invented, something created, something advanced). For a relatively long period of time, they studied once, practiced once, and then re-studied with the problems exposed in practice. After three or four rounds of this, they finally made everyone deeply understand that the viewpoints of stopping, inaction, and complacency are all wrong, and that they must constantly create and advance. How can we advance? They felt that first of all, we must have the revolutionary spirit of daring to break through and daring to go to a higher level. They are troops that train and produce at the same time. They demanded that they catch up with the troops that fully carried out training tasks in training, and catch up with the troops that fully undertook production tasks in production.
    In this way, we first used Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints to solve some major problems that urgently needed to be solved; and in the process of solving these major problems, we gradually transformed the fundamental problem of the world outlook.
    Their third experience is: consciously transform ideology in the process of guiding work. They said that studying Chairman Mao's writings, transforming ideology, and improving work are not isolated; there are various methods for transforming ideology, but for leading cadres above the regiment level, what often plays a role is consciously transforming ideology in the process of guiding work with Mao Zedong Thought. A certain regiment undertook a large-scale rice production task for the first time last year and lacked experience. The regimental Party committee felt that this was a good opportunity to overcome the subjective and one-sided ideological methods. They gave themselves a topic: "In the practice of production, get rid of the habit of blindly groping." In the process of production, they often used Chairman Mao's teaching that "no investigation, no right to speak" to warn themselves, and if they did not understand, they would learn from the basic-level cadres, soldiers, and old peasants of the troops with production experience, so the work proceeded smoothly. But when raising seedlings, some comrades relapsed, shortening the time for sowing seeds subjectively without investigating the local rural cadres and masses. Although the task of sowing seeds was completed ahead of schedule, the seedlings all grew up together later, and all needed to be transplanted into the fields in a short period of time, which made them very nervous and almost missed the farming season. Afterwards, they consciously aimed at this shortcoming in their work, reviewed "On Contradiction," found out the ideological root causes, and further criticized subjectivity and one-sidedness. Since then, every time they carry out a task, they carefully analyze the relationship between this task and other tasks, and better overcome the ideological method of looking at problems in isolation and one-sidedly, and the production task is completed better.
    The division and regiment Party committees also believe that: in the process of guiding work, not only can we consciously transform ideological methods, but also we can consciously transform problems in the aspect of ideological consciousness. Once, a certain regiment conducted education on management regulations for the companies. Before the education, the regimental Party committee believed that the shortcomings in the management education of the companies were mainly that the leading cadres of the regiment did not set an example for the troops. They believed that the lack of proletarian feelings for the soldiers was not only a problem of the basic-level cadres, but first of all a problem of the leaders themselves. Realizing this, they consciously studied Chairman Mao's thesis of "being ruthless to the enemy and harmonious to ourselves" before the troops studied it; when the troops studied, they went deep into the companies to give lectures and discuss with the cadres and soldiers, consciously accepting criticism from the companies' promotion of democracy. After the troops studied, they re-studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" with the problems reflected by the troops. After this study, not only did the management and education work of the troops make great progress, but also the class feelings and democratic style of the leading cadres of the regiment made obvious progress.
    From practice, the division and regiment cadres realized that: the relationship between transforming ideology and guiding work is a unity of opposites, and only by transforming ideology well can we better guide work; and only by consciously transforming ideology in the process of guiding work can the transformation of ideology achieve better results.

    毛泽东思想无往而不胜
    南京部队某部师团领导干部总结学习毛主席著作的经验：
    以革命精神，坚信毛泽东思想无往而不胜；以革命精神，坚持在改造思想、指导工作上的高标准、严要求；以革命精神，坚持理论联系实际，在实践中学，在群众中学，打破学习方法上的书生气。
    新华社南京二十六日电　中国人民解放军南京部队某部师团两级领导干部在学习毛主席著作中深刻体会到：学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，必须以革命精神，坚信毛泽东思想无往而不胜；必须以革命精神，坚持在改造思想、指导工作上的高标准、严要求；必须以革命精神，坚持理论联系实际，在实践中学，在群众中学，打破学习方法上的书生气。
    这支部队领导干部活学活用毛主席著作时间比较长，有很多经验，也有一些教训。几个月前，他们召开了党委扩大会，集思广益，总结出一些学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的经验。
    他们的第一条经验是：坚信才能坚定，敢用才能会用。他们说：不怕不会用，就怕不敢用；只有敢于用，才能会用。用得怎样，首先取决于革命的自觉性怎样。敢不敢用的问题，实质上是是否坚信毛泽东思想一用就灵，再用再灵，用到哪里哪里灵的问题。用，不仅要在一般情况下敢于用，而且要在任务艰巨、时间紧迫以及其他关键时刻敢学敢用。他们认为，关键时刻是最需要运用毛泽东思想的时刻，也是最容易“转向”的时刻。这个部队某团党委在这个问题上是深有体会的。他们去年担任生产任务，年初领受了在三月底以前积肥二十七万担的任务，到三月中旬仅完成了十三万担。因此有人就责难说：“学习毛主席著作和政治教育占用时间太多了，光磨镰不割草，没法交代。”怎么办？某团党委坚信，越是在这种情况下，越是要运用毛泽东思想，只有运用毛泽东思想，才能化困难为顺利，化被动为主动。于是，就在仅有的十几天生产时间里，拿出两天时间和部队一起学习毛主席“排除万难，去争取胜利”的论述。事实再一次证明，毛泽东思想一用就灵。经过学习，部队的革命英雄主义大大发扬，他们说：“不到长城非好汉，不拿下十四万担肥就不甘心！”结果在十几天时间里积肥二十四万担，超过原订指标十万担。
    敢用，就要在成绩暂时上不去的情况下，坚决用。另一个团是全师学习比较好的单位，曾经参加过南京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，特别是团长，不仅自己学得好，指导部队学习也好。可是，射击训练成绩一度不够理想。这时，就有人埋怨他“不务正业”，说：“你学习再好，训练成绩上不去有啥用。”但他顶得住，坚信自己走的是阳关大道，宁愿做个“政治团长”，把部队的政治搞得浓浓的，打起仗来冲得上、守得住，决不做“单纯军事团长”，片面抓训练“成绩”。团党委也坚信，真正用好了毛泽东思想，有了精神成果，到头来终究会出物质成果的。他们抓毛主席著作的学习抓得更紧，因而部队的政治空气更加浓厚，训练成绩也逐步上升了。他们深有体会地说：“不怕用不上，就怕转了向；不怕没成绩，就怕不坚持。”
    除了上述两种情况外，他们还体会到，敢用，就要在部队发生了问题的时候，坚决用；即使一时用得不好，甚至出了点差错，仍然要坚持用。总之，要在任何情况下，都对毛泽东思想坚信不移、坚持不懈。敢于在任何情况下运用毛泽东思想，是对党、对人民、对革命高度负责，因此，要不怕担风险，不怕出差错，去掉一切私心杂念，破除一切妨碍运用毛泽东思想的各种错误思想。
    他们的第二条经验是：用毛主席的根本观点，解决急需解决的主要问题。
    他们说：学习毛主席著作，要带的问题很多。有个性的，有共性的；有主要的，有次要的；有急的，有缓的。这些问题不可能在同一时间内一下子都解决，要首先解决有普遍性的急需解决的主要问题。一个急需解决的主要问题解决了，再解决另一个急需解决的主要问题。这样长期坚持下去，既能立竿见影地解决现实问题，也能逐步系统地解决根本问题。
    有个时期，这个部队领导班子变动很大，有的调出，有的调进，有的是新提拔起来的，担负的任务又是新的。在新任务、新班子的条件下，他们认为不能降低要求、降低标准，而更应当把工作做得好上加好。但是遇到的问题是，领导思想水平跟不上形势发展的需要，常常是心有余而力不足，领导思想水平不提高，再好的革命愿望也不易实现。因此，他们便决定首先解决这个问题。毛主席说：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”毛主席的教导使他们进一步领会了：领导的思想水平和工作经验只有不断实践才能提高和丰富，干革命常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。因此他们纷纷到连队蹲点、试点、调查研究，一时形成了一股“吃梨子”和“抓两权”（经过调查研究才有发言权和领导权）的风气。这样，师团领导的思想水平提高了，对各项工作的指导比较扎实，也取得了较好的成绩。在成绩面前，有些同志暴露了安于现状的苗头，他们满足于一般的干劲，一般的领导，一般的完成任务。师团党委认为，这一障碍不拆除，不但不能继续前进，就连已经取得的成果也难保住。于是，又反复学习一分为二观点，破“三个一般”（一般的干劲，一般的领导，一般的完成任务），立“四个有所”（有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进）。在一段较长的时间里，他们学习一次，实践一次，再带着实践中暴露出的问题，重新学习。经过这样三四个回合，终于使大家较深刻地理解到停止的论点、无所作为和骄傲自满的论点都是错误的，必须不断地有所创造，有所前进。怎样才能有所前进呢？他们觉得首先要有敢闯的革命精神，敢于更上一层楼。他们是边训练边生产的部队，他们要求做到在训练上赶全部执行训练任务的部队，在生产上赶全部担负生产任务的部队。
    这样，首先用毛主席的根本观点，解决了一些急需解决的主要问题；并在解决这些主要问题的过程中，逐步地改造世界观这个根本问题。
    他们的第三个经验是：在指导工作的过程中自觉地改造思想。他们说，学习毛主席著作，改造思想和改进工作并不是孤立的；改造思想有种种方法，对团以上的领导干部来说，经常起作用的是在用毛泽东思想指导工作的过程中自觉地改造思想。有个团去年第一次担任大面积水稻生产任务，缺乏经验。团党委觉得这正是克服思想方法主观片面的好时机。他们给自己出了一个题目：“在生产实践中改掉闭塞眼睛捉麻雀”的毛病。在生产过程中，他们经常用毛主席“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导来告诫自己，不懂就向有生产经验的部队基层干部、战士和老农学习，因而工作进行得较顺利。但在育秧时，有的同志老病重犯，没有向当地农村干部和群众调查就主观地缩短了落谷时间，虽然落谷任务提前完成了，但后来秧苗一齐长大，需要在短时间内全部插到田里去，弄得十分紧张，险些误了农时，事后，他们自觉地针对这一工作上的缺点，重温《矛盾论》，找出了思想根源，进一步批判了主观片面性。从此，他们每进行一件工作，都要仔细地分析这件工作与其他工作之间的联系，比较好地克服了孤立、片面看问题的思想方法，生产任务完成的较好。
    师团党委还认为：在指导工作的过程中，不仅可以自觉地改造思想方法，而且可以自觉地改造思想意识方面的问题。有一次有个团对连队进行管理条例教育。教育前，团党委认为连队在管理教育方面存在的缺点主要是团的领导干部没有给部队做出样子来。他们认为，对战士缺乏无产阶级感情，不仅是基层干部的问题，而首先是领导本身。认识到这一点，他们就自觉地在部队学习以前，先学习了毛主席“对敌狠，对己和”的论述；在部队学习时，又深入连队讲课，同干部战士一起讨论，从连队发扬民主中自觉地接受批评，在部队学习后，他们又带着部队反映出的问题，重新学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。经过这次学习，不仅部队的管理教育工作有了一大进步，团的领导干部的阶级感情和民主作风也有了明显进步。
    从实践中，师团干部体会到：改造思想和指导工作的关系，是对立统一的关系，只有改造好了思想，才能更好地指导工作；也只有在指导工作的过程中自觉地改造思想，才可能使思想改造收到更好的效果。
