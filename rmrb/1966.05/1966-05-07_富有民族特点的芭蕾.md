    Ballet with Rich National Characteristics
    Su Fengzhu
    Just as the nation is launching a vigorous Great Cultural Revolution, promoting proletarian ideology, and eliminating bourgeois ideology, seeing the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" fills me with excitement. The performance of this drama uses ironclad facts to powerfully refute the fallacies of those who advocate taking the bourgeois path in literature and art.
    There are many things in the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" that are worth learning for literary and artistic workers. I believe the most important and fundamental point is to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the comrades of the Shanghai School of Dance. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and make a great revolution in ballet, using this foreign and ancient art form to create biographies for China's poor and lower-middle peasants, shaping heroic images of the working people, and serving proletarian politics. This is a great joyous event in the Great Cultural Revolution and a result of literary and artistic workers highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong's works.
    There are many successful and distinctive aspects of the ballet, for example:
    The theme is clear—the entire ballet is consistently threaded with a red line of class struggle. The plot is clear, the structure is concise, and it has the characteristics of traditional Chinese opera: dance in the drama, drama in the dance, and all the dances do not break away from the content of the plot to dance for the sake of dancing, nor are they restricted by the original program, but depart from life, depart from the content, make breakthroughs, and make innovations.
    The ballet has songs and dances, combining singing and dancing. This suits the Chinese people's appreciation habits. More importantly, the addition of singing to the ballet can help the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers better understand the plot, and at the same time can play a role in deepening the content and more fully expressing the inner feelings of the characters. Several songs in the ballet are particularly exciting, such as Xi'er's "I will not die, I want to live, I want revenge" mood, which is difficult to express through dance. Adding these few lines of singing powerfully expresses Xi'er's thoughts and feelings at the time, and the accompanying comrades sing well, with great infection.
    Another characteristic and success of the ballet is the bold absorption and application of folk dance, and it is well integrated, not at all rigid. This is an organic combination of ballet and Chinese national dance, not a hard拼凑在一起. So after watching it, it doesn't feel foreign. For example, when Yang Bailao is beaten to death and Xi'er kneels and rushes to her father, it uses the techniques of opera, but it completely conforms to the feelings of the Chinese people. The ballet provides us with very valuable experience in nationalization.
    In terms of artistic techniques, the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is very imaginative and unique. For example, in the scene "Wild Mountain", the ballet uses film techniques to express Xi'er's suffering from fighting with nature and her growth in the wind and rain through several hair color changes, concisely expressing the innovative and infectious performance techniques, and also gives play to the characteristics of the ballet.
    In short, I feel that the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is a brand-new revolutionary modern ballet. Its performance provides us with valuable experience in the revolutionization of ballet, and valuable experience in how to achieve a better unity of revolutionary content and artistic form, indicating that only by starting from life, only by starting from revolutionary content, and only by shaping the perfect heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the stage, can we boldly break through old forms and create new forms.

    富有民族特点的芭蕾
    苏凤竹
    正当全国掀起轰轰烈烈的文化大革命，大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想的时候，看到芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，心情十分激动。这个剧的演出，用铁的事实，有力地驳斥了那些鼓吹走资产阶级文艺路线的人的谬论。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》值得文艺工作者学习的地方很多。我认为最重要、最根本的一点，是要学习上海市舞蹈学校同志们的那种勇于革命的精神。他们在毛泽东思想指引下，面向工农兵，大闹芭蕾革命，利用芭蕾这种外来的、古老的艺术形式，为我国贫下中农立传，塑造出劳动人民的英雄形象，为无产阶级政治服务，这是文化大革命当中的一件大喜事，是文艺工作者突出政治，活学活用毛泽东著作的结果。
    舞剧成功之处很多，很有特点，例如：
    主题思想鲜明——整个舞剧，自始至终贯穿着一根阶级斗争的红线。情节清晰，结构精炼，具有中国传统戏剧的特点：舞中有戏，戏中有舞，而且所有的舞蹈，不是脱离开剧情内容，为舞而舞，也不拘泥于原来的程式，而是从生活出发，从内容出发，有所突破，有所创新。
    舞剧有歌有舞，歌舞结合。这是适合中国人民的欣赏习惯的。更主要的是，舞剧加进了歌唱，能帮助工农兵群众更好地理解剧情，同时能起到加深内容和更饱满地表达人物内心感情的作用。舞剧有几段唱特别激动人心，如喜儿的“我不死，我要活，我要报仇”那种心情，如用舞蹈，很难表现，加进这几句唱，就把喜儿当时的思想感情有力表现出来，伴唱的同志唱得也好，很有感染力。
    舞剧的另一个特点和成功之处，是大胆吸收和运用了民间舞，而且揉合得好，一点不生硬。这是芭蕾和中国民族舞有机的化合，不是硬拼凑在一起的。所以看完之后，不觉得洋气。比如杨白劳被打死，喜儿跪着扑向父亲，是采用了戏曲的手法，但是，完全符合中国人的感情的。舞剧在民族化上，给我们提供了非常宝贵的经验。
    在艺术手法上，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》很有想象力，别具一格。如《荒山》这一场，舞剧运用了电影手法，把喜儿和大自然搏斗所受的苦难以及在风雨中锻炼成长，通过几次头发变色，精炼地表现出来，表现手法新颖，富有感染力，而且又发挥了舞剧的特点。
    总之，我感到芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是一个崭新的革命现代芭蕾舞剧。它的演出，为我们提供了芭蕾革命化的宝贵经验，提供了革命内容和艺术形式如何求得更好的统一的宝贵经验，说明只有从生活出发，只有从革命的内容出发，从塑造舞台上完美的工农兵英雄形象出发，才能大胆地突破旧形式，创造新形式。（附图片）
