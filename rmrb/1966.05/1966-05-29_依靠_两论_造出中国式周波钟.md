　　Relying on "Two Theories" to Create a Chinese-Style Frequency Clock
　　Good worker, Shanghai Red Flag Youth Shock Team member, worker-turned technician Fang Fugen

　　We, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, after more than a year of effort, have created China's first frequency clock. Compared with similar foreign products, this clock has a much simpler and more reasonable structure, is much more convenient to manufacture and use, has a much lower cost, and its accuracy has reached the most advanced level. This is a Chinese-style frequency clock.

　　In the past, we people didn't know what a frequency clock was, we hadn't even heard the name. I was originally an apprentice in a nib factory, and although I studied at a vocational school for two years, I didn't study clockmaking. Several other comrades had studied clockmaking, but had never seen a frequency clock. What is a frequency clock? A frequency clock is not only used for timekeeping, but also a precision instrument indispensable for power plants to measure power generation frequency. Its accuracy is much higher than ordinary clocks. The highest-grade ordinary clocks have an error of a dozen seconds in twenty-four hours, while the error of a frequency clock cannot exceed one second. The reason we were able to make the frequency clock is entirely due to Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" armed our minds, helped us break free from the superstition of bourgeois "authorities," "experts," and "foreign books," and gave us sharp weapons to understand and transform the objective world.

　　We accepted this task in the spring of 1964.

　　At that time, we heard that the Electric Power Bureau had an American frequency clock manufactured in the 1920s, and everyone said: "Let's go and see it first, and then make a decision!" We were shocked when we saw it. This clock was placed in a constant-temperature instrument room, and a master craftsman was specially assigned to serve it all year round. Except for repairs, the clock door was not usually opened, because this clock could not withstand the slightest vibration or dust.

　　I approached the clock and looked inside through the glass door: the gears of this clock were already worn, the "chromium" coating on the outside had fallen off, and it was older than myself. We can't use Chinese frequency clocks to replace it today, we still have to serve this "shoddy product," which is a real shame for us young technicians studying clockmaking. It was also said that a large-scale hydroelectric power station built by our country was entirely made of our own products, and the only frequency clock was imported. We must fight for it! Today, we are workers of great China, proletarian fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, why can't we catch up with and surpass the Western bourgeoisie in clockmaking technology? We all have this common wish, we must rely on our own efforts to build a better frequency clock!

　　The Party branch also pointed out to us that the trial production of frequency clocks is an important political task, and the trial production process should be regarded as a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. After the education of the Party, our confidence in the trial production of frequency clocks was even greater.

　　　　Firmly believe in Chairman Mao's words and follow our own path

　　But what kind of frequency clock should we make? There was still ideological struggle among us.

　　Some engineers were superstitious about foreign science and technology, and always felt that we could only walk with "foreign crutches," believing that "the task is so urgent, and we are not sure, let's 'refer to' others!" The so-called "reference" is actually copying.

　　Once, we went to Anhui to see a frequency clock imported from abroad a few years ago. This clock had gears overlapping each other, parts of the mechanism twisting and turning, and wires stretched back and forth, making people dizzy. When it really needed to be used, it was like a person with a chronic disease, walking for a while, and then "falling" again after a while. When we went, the comrades there were worried because it had stopped working again, and the problem could not be solved. This is revisionism deliberately trying to bully us, but some people still think it is amazing, thinking that the structure, parts, and even the wooden shell and screws of the frequency clock are foreign-made, and we should learn from foreign countries. Some of our comrades were really a little angry at the time. Could it be that we Chinese even have to follow the "foreign framework" for a screw! Chairman Mao taught us: "When learning, use your brains to think about it, learn those things that are suitable for our country's situation, that is, absorb the beneficial experience for us, this is the attitude we need." Like some "experts" and "authorities," blindly worshiping foreign frameworks, isn't it destroying our own ambitions and increasing the prestige of the bourgeoisie? We must listen carefully to Chairman Mao's words, learn in practice, boldly create, and learn from other people's experience with a revolutionary critical spirit. However, some comrades felt that this proposal lacked the spirit of "three strictness" (strict attitude, strict requirements, strict methods), I couldn't understand it, could it be that following Chairman Mao's teachings, going through practice in everything, and letting practice draw conclusions is lacking "three strictness"? Is copying foreign books "three strictness"?

　　Starting from this understanding, I put forward a design plan. Some so-called "authorities" asked: "Is there a theoretical basis?" I said no, theory will arise in practice. Seeing that I couldn't produce a theoretical basis for a while, they adopted a non-recognition policy and immediately rejected me.

　　They spent several months, completely imitating foreign frequency clocks, and finally produced one. After verification, the time error was as high as ten seconds or more. Compared with the world's advanced level of error not exceeding one second, the gap was too large. These so-called "authorities" did not learn a lesson from it, but instead believed that the "imitation" was not complete or thorough enough. Therefore, they compared each part with foreign frequency clocks, and all those that were not completely imitated were reworked. If the pointer was too long, it was cut shorter; if the part was too light, it was replaced with a heavier one... What was the result? After verification, the error was still five or six seconds.

　　This incident educated me from the opposite side, the road of blindly believing in bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" is a dead end; listening to Chairman Mao's words, everything becomes clear, and the road becomes wider and wider. I am even more determined: I must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, be brave in practice, break all frameworks, dare to challenge all bourgeois "authorities," and firmly follow our own path of technological development.

　　　　Practice is the best school

　　How to break out of a Chinese-style path?

　　I also consulted Chairman Mao's "On Practice." Chairman Mao said: "How can you get tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" To understand something, the fundamental problem lies in practice. Think about myself: I can't talk about theory, let alone experience, there is only one way, that is, I must enter the "tiger's den." Therefore, I was determined to be honest and go to practice to learn, compare various methods of others in practice, and see the strengths and weaknesses of others; through practical work, "thoroughly understand" the interrelationships and operating laws of various parts of the frequency clock.

　　In this period of trial production, in order to solve the problem of the energy supplement device for the pendulum, we conducted a large number of experiments. This energy supplement device is a very important part of the frequency clock. The pendulum is like a person marching a long distance, and the energy supplement device is like a "mobile canteen," which must supply well and in a timely manner to ensure that the pendulum keeps walking and walks accurately. Judging from some foreign frequency clocks, there are many ways to supply this "canteen," which one is the best and can suit our situation?

　　At that time, it was said that a "fixed time" method was the most advanced. However, if this method is adopted, the frequency clock must not be interfered with by the outside world at all. To solve this contradiction, the frequency clock must be placed in a specially built basement. I thought, we want to build in the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, can our hydroelectric power station use such a delicate frequency clock? No! We can't use this method. Therefore, we experimented with other methods one by one. After more than three months and dozens of experiments, although we did not find a method that was completely suitable for us, it was not in vain. Because after comparing various methods, we had a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Later, we concentrated the strengths of others and designed a new energy supplement device based on our situation. It doesn't need to put the frequency clock in the basement at all, and it can supplement energy at any time according to the needs of the pendulum, and the effect is very good.

　　In order to master the operating rules of various mechanical parts, I carefully observed various phenomena. One night, when I was observing the swing range of the pendulum, I saw from the light and shadow refracted when the pendulum swung that after swinging left and right dozens of times, the pendulum suddenly swayed slightly forward and backward. If it was an accidental phenomenon, it was already late at night, the surroundings were very quiet, and there was no external influence; if it was a necessary phenomenon, it had never been discovered before. I tracked down this suspicious phenomenon.

　　This shaking only lasted for 0.3 seconds each time, and it was very difficult to see, and my eyes became sore after a while. In order to grasp the primary data, I insisted on observing every day. At that time, it was already the hot dog days of summer. The studio was originally a cement-built ice storage, three meters square, with no windows on all sides, and electric fans could not be used, because the wind in the laboratory would affect the accuracy of the pendulum's movement. Standing there, it was stuffy and hot, and my whole body was soaked in sweat in an instant. In this way, I persisted for a month, two months... By the third month, I finally found the reason for the pendulum's shaking. Once the reason was found, the contradiction was quickly resolved.

　　Chairman Mao said: "Learn warfare through warfare - this is our main method. ... Often it is not learning well before doing, but learning while doing, doing is learning." After a period of practice, I finally had a more comprehensive and deeper understanding of the rules of the frequency clock, and I increasingly realized that practice is really the best school. Only through practice can we improve our ability to understand the objective world; only through practice can we learn to master the skills to transform the objective world.

　　　　Dare to challenge all "authorities"

　　Chairman Mao taught us: "The change and movement of the objective real world never ends, and people's understanding of the truth in practice never ends." The experience of predecessors is not immutable, and we descendants not only can, but also should have the responsibility to enrich and develop it. There are essences and dregs in the experience of predecessors. Only by breaking those old concepts can we recognize and create new things; only by breaking those old frameworks and daring to challenge all "authorities" can technology develop and can we find our own way.

　　In the process of trial production, the problem to be solved with concentrated efforts was the relationship between the pendulum and the gear. Since the advent of pendulum clocks, for hundreds of years, the pendulum and the gear have always been connected together, and the gear is driven by the pendulum. Few people doubt that there is any problem here. However, after dozens of analyses and experiments, I found that the problem lies precisely in the conventional "pendulum drives the gear." Any problem in the complex mechanism structure will increase the burden on the pendulum through the gear. The pendulum driving a pile of gears is like carrying a big burden on its back, which is prone to problems.

　　One morning, I saw several athletes on the road outside the door, wearing vests and shorts, practicing long-distance running, running very lightly. I thought, the athletes took off many outer clothes and ran so lightly, why can't I think of a way to let the pendulum also put down the burden and run as comfortably as the athletes? Following this line of thought, I discovered a very simple and easily overlooked truth: the pendulum is the standard for timekeeping, each swing, "tick," "?", is two seconds. The gears serve the pendulum, and their role is to help the pendulum record the number of swings one by one. These two things are closely related and different from each other. Therefore, I boldly imagined: separating the pendulum from the gear, and having the pendulum send a signal to command the gear to rotate through electricity to record the number of swings.

　　When I put forward this idea and sought the opinions of others, some people said: "Experiment, that's okay; but if this road can be taken, I'm afraid others have already taken it." I thought, the road that others have not taken does not prove that this road is impassable; the road that others have not taken even more cannot prove that the road I want to take cannot be taken. Everything still needs to be tested in practice. Therefore, I conducted new experiments according to my conceived plan. After the experiment, it was indeed very promising, with an error of only half a second in twenty-four hours. However, it also brought a very tricky new problem: it would stop sometimes when it was running. When we were in difficulty, we thought of solutions collectively. Many young workers and young technicians enthusiastically supported the experiment and gave me a lot of ideas. People with "experience" in clock research shook their heads and said: "I have never heard of a pendulum clock being driven by electricity, electricity is not reliable..."

　　We carefully analyzed these different opinions. Now, the time error of the clock has dropped from five or six seconds to only half a second, which proves that the road is right; the reason why it stops when it is running is only because we have not fully mastered the new rules of using electricity to command the gear to rotate. Chairman Mao told us: "In the scope of the struggle for production and scientific experiment, mankind is constantly developing, nature is also constantly developing, and will never stop at one level." Now, our ability to control electricity is improving, and our use of the material conditions of electricity is also developing, as long as we continue to muster the courage to experiment, this problem can always be solved.

　　Therefore, we further repeatedly observed, analyzed, and experimented. Finally, we finally found the answer: the reason why it stops when it is running is not the problem of the electric energy itself, but the related parts and machinery have problems, which affect the transmission of electricity. After making a few improvements to address the problem, the circuit was unblocked, the frequency clock operated normally, and the daily time error stabilized within one second.

　　In the process of trial production, we also found that some formulas and laws in the past were not correct. In a book called "Clock Mechanism," a foreign scientist derived a formula for calculating the size, position, and weight of the pendulum. For more than ten years, we have calculated the pendulum according to this formula when making pendulum clocks. This time, I also calculated the size, position, and weight of the pendulum according to this formula. However, the calculations were perfect, but the actual work was not perfect. Was I wrong, or was this formula wrong? At the beginning, I always thought that I had calculated wrong, but the result of repeated verification proved that the calculation was not wrong. I also found several different materials and did several experiments, and the result proved that this formula was wrong. It did not take into account the important factor of what kind of material to use. In fact, there is a lot of attention to what kind of material is used. During the experiment, I used two materials of the same size and different components to do the experiment, and the result was that the speed of the pendulum's swing was very different. Later, I simply discarded this "theory that is well-spoken but cannot be compared in practice" formula, and conducted experiments according to our actual situation, and found the correct size, position, and weight of the pendulum.

　　From this period of practice, I deeply realized that: only by adhering to and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of criticism can we break the old and establish the new, create something, and make progress. The idea that the laws and theorems in foreign books cannot be moved is metaphysical and does not conform to the laws of development of things. Human society is developing, nature is developing, and people's understanding of the objective world should also constantly develop. Traditional technical concepts and formulas and laws in books are all created by predecessors under certain conditions. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and re-understanding the existing conclusions and formulas can we have new development and new creation in technology.

　　Chinese-style frequency clock is the product of Mao Zedong Thought

　　After the pendulum is separated from the gear, because the structure principle is different, some parts are eliminated. Compared with foreign frequency clocks, the structure is much simpler. Some people were a little worried after seeing it: "The accuracy requirements of the frequency clock are very high, you have made it so simple now, can the quality be guaranteed?" It seems that only complex things are precise. This is also an old concept. In fact, some complex frequency clocks are not necessarily good. Take the frequency clock imported from abroad, which revisionism deliberately used to bully us, its structure is very complex. Because it is complex, it brings negative factors. Its gears are more than others, its parts are more than others, which not only affect each other and increase the burden on the pendulum, but also bring great trouble to use and maintenance. It is really "more harmful than helpful." The law of development of things is originally from simple to complex, and then from complex to new simple. The earliest timekeeping tool in the world was "setting up a pole to see the shadow," called a sundial, and later it developed to "copper pot dripping." Later, someone created gears and springs, and connected the pendulum with the spring and gear, which made the structure of the clock complex. But now, isn't there an electronic clock that doesn't need a spring or a pendulum? We are a great socialist country, we have the great Mao Zedong Thought as a pointer, and all our products should start from the convenience of manufacturing and use, and should be both precise and more precise, and simple and simpler. Today, we should and can recognize things and create new things according to the original laws of things. I researched and compared various foreign frequency clocks from 1922 to around 1958. Their common feature is that the structure is complex. This is inseparable from the scientific and technological conditions at that time and is related to the social system. Frequency clocks in capitalist countries and countries ruled by revisionism are not only complex in structure, but also have some formalistic and complex parts, which look scary, but are of no practical value. This is the product of their decadent thoughts. This kind of thing does not exist in our frequency clocks at all. From the process of trial production of frequency clocks, we deeply realized that to manufacture advanced products, we must first have advanced ideas, and we must revolutionize our thinking; and to revolutionize our thinking, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to take command.

　　In order to be more in line with China's actual situation, to make the frequency clock simpler and more reasonable, and to make manufacturing, use, and maintenance more convenient, with the support of the Party organization, I and the worker comrades further conducted experiments together. After more than 40 "operations" before and after, nearly half of the main parts of the frequency clock were cut off, and more than half of the parts reduced the technical requirements of mechanical processing. In this way, the structure of the frequency clock is almost simpler than that of an ordinary table clock, its accuracy has been greatly improved, and it has caught up with the most advanced level. Moreover, it can be completely made of domestic materials, and ordinary clock factories can manufacture it.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, with the joint efforts of comrades and the enthusiastic cooperation of fraternal units, our first Chinese-style frequency clock was finally born in September 1965.

　　The successful trial production of the frequency clock is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a product of "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Now that we have manufactured Chinese-style frequency clocks, there are more Chinese-style products that need us to create. We must more consciously study Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to further transform our subjective world, and better understand and transform the objective world.

    依靠“两论”造出中国式周波钟
    五好职工、上海市红旗青年突击手、工人出身的技术员　方福根
    我们以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，经过一年多的努力，造出了我国第一台周波钟。这只钟，同外国的同类产品相比，结构要简单合理得多，制造、使用要方便得多，成本要低得多，而且精确度达到了最先进的水平。这是一台中国式的周波钟。
    过去，我们这些人根本不知道什么叫周波钟，连名字都没有听到过。我原来是一家笔尖厂里的学徒，虽然读过两年中专，但是学的并不是造钟。还有几位同志，有的虽然也研究过钟表的制造，但是也没有见到过周波钟。什么是周波钟呢？周波钟不单可以用来计时，而且是发电站用来测量发电频率不可缺少的精密仪表。它的精度比普通钟表要高得多。普通最高级的钟表走二十四小时有十几秒钟的误差，而周波钟误差不能超过一秒钟。我们所以能把周波钟造出来，全靠毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》。毛主席的《实践论》《矛盾论》，武装了我们的头脑，帮助我们破除了对资产阶级“权威”、“专家”以及“洋本本”的迷信，给了我们认识和改造客观世界的锐利武器。
    我们接受这项任务，是在一九六四年春天。
    当时，我们听说电业局有一台美国二十年代制造的周波钟，大家就说：“先去看看，然后再打主意吧！”不看还罢，一看吓了一跳。这台钟放在一间恒温的仪器室里，专门有一位老师傅，一年四季在侍候它。除了检修，平时钟门还不好打开，因为这只钟，经不起一点振动，受不得一点灰尘。
    我走近钟前，隔着玻璃门往里一看：这台钟的齿轮已经磨损了，外面涂的“克罗米”也脱落得不象样子了，年龄比我自己还大得多。我们今天不能用中国的周波钟去代替它，还得侍候这种“蹩脚货”，这对我们研究钟表的青年技术人员来说，实在是一种耻辱。又听说，我国自己建造的一个大型水力发电站，里面什么东西都是我国自己造的，唯一的一台周波钟却是进口货。我们说什么也得争一口气！今天，我们是伟大的中国的工人，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级战士，为什么不能在制钟工业技术上赶上和超过西方资产阶级呢？我们都有这样一个共同的愿望，说什么也要自力更生把更好的周波钟造出来！
    党支部也向我们指出，试制周波钟是一项重要的政治任务，应该把试制的过程作为活学活用毛主席著作的过程。经过党的教育，我们试制周波钟的信心更足了。
        坚信毛主席的话，走自己的路
    但是，到底要造一台什么样的周波钟呢？我们中间还是有思想斗争的。
    有的工程师迷信外国的科学技术，总觉得我们只能拄着“洋拐棍”走路，认为“任务这么紧，我们又没有把握，还是‘参考参考’人家的吧！”所谓“参考”，其实就是照抄。
    有一次，我们到安徽去看一台前几年从外国进口的周波钟。这台钟，搞得齿轮重重迭迭，机心零件转弯抹角，电线拉来拉去，弄得人眼花缭乱。真正要派它用场，就象有慢性病的人一样，一个时期走走，过一个时期又“病”倒了。我们去的时候，那里的同志正在发愁，因为它又不走了，毛病怎么也治不好。这是修正主义存心要欺负我们，可是有的人还觉得它不得了，认为周波钟的结构、零件，甚至连木壳、螺丝钉也是外国的好，要学外国的。我们有些同志当时心里实在有点气不过。难道我们中国人，连一只螺丝钉都得按“洋框框”办吗！毛主席教导我们说：“学习的时候用脑筋想一下，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西，即吸取对我们有益的经验，我们需要的是这样一种态度。”象某些“专家”“权威”这样，一味崇拜洋框框，不是灭我们自己的志气，长资产阶级的威风吗？我们要认真听毛主席的话，在实践中学习，要大胆创造，对人家的经验应该用革命的批判的精神去学习。但是，有的同志觉得这样提，缺乏“三严”精神（严肃的态度、严格的要求、严密的方法），我想不通，难道遵循毛主席的教导，一切经过实践，让实践来作结论就是缺乏“三严”吗？照抄照搬洋本本就算“三严”吗？
    从这一认识出发，我提出了一个设计方案。有些所谓“权威”便问：“有理论根据吗？”我说没有，实践中会产生理论的。他们看到我一时拿不出理论根据，就采取不承认主义，一下子把我顶了回来。
    他们花了几个月时间，完全仿照外国的周波钟，总算搞出来一台。一校验，走时误差竟高达十秒以上。同世界先进水平误差不超过一秒钟相比，差距太大了。这些所谓“权威”并没有从中吸取教训，反而认为“仿”得还不完全、不彻底。于是，就照着外国的周波钟，一样一样零件作对比，凡是仿得不完全一样的，通通返工重搞。指针长了，就剪短一些；零件分量轻了，就换一个重的……结果怎么样呢？校验下来，误差还是有五六秒。
    这件事，从反面教育了我，走迷信资产阶级“专家”“权威”的道路，是死胡同；听毛主席的话，一通百通，路子越来越宽广。我更加坚定了决心：一定要照毛主席的教导办事，勇于实践，打破一切框框，敢于向一切资产阶级“权威”挑战，坚定地走我们自己的发展技术的道路。
              实践是最好的学校
    怎样闯出中国式的道路来呢？
    我又请教了毛主席的《实践论》。毛主席说：“不入虎穴，焉得虎子。”要认识一件事物，根本的问题在于实践。想想我自己：理论我讲不上，经验更没有，只有一条路，就是非入“虎穴”不可。于是，我抱定老老实实的态度，到实践中去学习，把人家的各种办法，都拿到实践中去加以比较，看出人家的长处和短处；通过实地去做，把周波钟各个部分的相互关系和运转规律“吃透”。
    在这一段试制工作中，为了解决钟摆的能量补充装置问题，我们进行了大量的试验。这个能量补充装置是周波钟中很重要的一个部分。钟摆就好比一个长途行军的人，能量补充装置就好比一个“随军食堂”，它要供应得好，供应得及时，才能保证钟摆不停地走而且走得准。从外国的一些周波钟来看，这个“食堂”的供应方法有许多种，究竟哪一种最好，能够适合我们的情况呢？
    当时听说有一种“定时间”的方法最先进。但是，采用这种办法，周波钟要一点也不能受外界的干扰。要解决这个矛盾，要把周波钟放在专门造的地下室里。我想，我们要按总路线的精神多快好省地搞建设，我们的水力发电站能够用这么娇贵的周波钟吗？不行！这种办法我们不能用。于是，又对另外的几种办法，一种一种地进行试验。前后经过三个多月、几十次试验，虽然没有找到完全适合于我们的办法，但是也没有白费力气。因为经过用各种办法进行比较，对各种办法的长处和短处都有了全面的了解。后来，就把人家的长处集中起来，根据我们的情况，设计了一种新的能量补充装置。它根本不需要把周波钟放在地下室里，而且能够根据钟摆的需要，随时补充能量，效果很好。
    为了掌握各部分机械的运行规律，我就仔细观察各种现象。有一天夜里，我在观察钟摆的摆动幅度时，从钟摆摆动时折射出来的光影中，看到钟摆在左右摆动几十下以后，突然极其轻微地前后晃动了一下。说它是个偶然的现象吧，当时已是深夜，周围非常安静，并没有什么外界因素的影响；说它是个必然现象吧，平时却从来没有发现过。我就对这个可疑的现象跟踪追查下去。
    这种晃动每次只有零点三秒，看起来非常吃力，一会儿眼睛就看得发痠。为了掌握第一性资料，我还是天天坚持观察。那时候，已经是炎热的三伏天了。工作室原来是一座水泥砌的冰库，大小三米见方，四面没有窗户，而且不能用电风扇，实验室里一有风，就会影响钟摆走动的准确性。人站在那里，又闷又热，一下子浑身就给汗水湿透了。就这样，坚持了一个月、两个月……到了第三个月，终于找到了钟摆晃动的原因。原因一找到，矛盾很快就解决了。
    毛主席说：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。……常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”经过一段时期的实践，我终于对周波钟的规律，有了比较全面、比较深刻的了解，越来越体会到，实践真是个最好的学校。只有通过实践，才能使我们提高对客观世界的认识能力；只有通过实践，才能学习掌握改造客观世界的本领。
          敢于向一切“权威”挑战
    毛主席教导我们：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”前人的经验，都不是万古不变的，我们后人不但可以、而且应该有责任去丰富它、发展它。前人的经验中，有精华，也有糟粕。只有破除那些旧的观念，才能认识和创造新的事物；只有破除那些旧的框框，敢于向一切“权威”挑战，技术才能发展，才能走出我们自己的路。
    在试制的过程中，要集中力量解决的，是钟摆和齿轮的关系问题。自从有摆钟以来，几百年了，从来就是钟摆和齿轮连在一起，由钟摆带动齿轮走。很少有人怀疑这里头有什么问题。但是，在经过几十次的分析和试验以后，我发现，问题恰恰就出在这个“钟摆带动齿轮走”的常规上面。复杂的机心结构当中任何一点毛病，都会通过齿轮增加钟摆的负担。钟摆带动一大堆齿轮走，就象背上了一个大包袱，很容易出毛病。
    有一天早晨，我看到门口马路上有几个运动员，穿着背心、短裤在练长跑，跑得非常轻快。我想，运动员脱掉了许多外衣，就跑得这么轻快，为什么不可以想个办法，让钟摆也放下包袱，象运动员那样走得惬意点呢？顺着这条思路想下去，我发现了一个很简单、也是很容易被忽略的道理：钟摆就是计时间的标准，每一次摆动，“滴”、“?”两声，就是两秒钟。齿轮是为钟摆服务的，它们的作用是帮助钟摆把摆动的次数一一记下来。这两样东西，既有密切联系，又各有区别。于是，我就大胆设想：把钟摆与齿轮分开，由摆发出讯号，通过电去指挥齿轮运转，记录摆动的次数。
    当我把这个设想提出来，征求别人的意见时，有人说：“试验嘛，也可以；不过，这条路要是走得通，恐怕人家早就走了。”我想，人家没有走通的路，并不能证明此路不通；人家没有走过的路，更不能证明我要走的这条路不能走。一切都还要到实践中去检验。于是，我就根据自己设想的方案，进行了新的试验。试验下来，果然很有“苗头”，走二十四小时误差只有半秒钟。不过，同时也带来了一个很棘手的新问题：走走有时会停掉。在困难的时候，我们就集体想办法。不少青年工人和青年技术员热情地支持试验，帮我出了不少点子。对钟表研究有“经验”的人却摇头说：“从来也没有听说过摆钟可以用电来带动齿轮，电这样东西不保险……。”
    我们仔细分析这些不同意见。现在，钟的走时误差已经从五六秒下降到只有半秒，这证明路子是对的；走走要停，只是因为我们对用电指挥齿轮运转的新规律还没有完全掌握。毛主席告诉我们：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。”现在，我们对电的驾驭能力正在提高，我们利用电的物质条件也在发展，只要继续鼓起勇气试验下去，这个问题总是能解决的。
    于是，我们又进一步反复观察、分析和试验。最后，终于找到了答案：走走会停，不是电能本身的问题，而是有关的零件和机械出了毛病，影响了电的输送。针对问题作了几处改进，电路畅通了，周波钟的运转也正常了，每天的走时误差稳定在一秒以内。
    在试制的过程中，我们还发现：过去有些公式、定律并不正确。在一本叫《钟表机构》的书里，有一个外国科学家求出一种计算钟摆的尺寸、位置、重量的公式。十几年来，我们造摆钟都照这个公式计算。这一次，我也根据这个公式来计算钟摆的尺寸、位置和重量。但是，算算满对，实际做起来就是对不起来。到底是我错了，还是这个公式错了呢？开始，我还总以为是自己计算错了，但是，一再地进行验算的结果，证明运算并没有错。我又找了几种不同的材料，做了几次试验，结果证明：这个公式是不对的。它根本没有考虑到用什么样的材料这样一个重要的因素。其实，用什么样成分的材料，大有讲究。试验的时候，用了两种尺寸相同、成分不同的材料做试验，结果钟摆摆动的快慢就相差很大。后来，我就干脆丢开了这个“理论上讲得头头是道、实际上无法对照”的公式，根据我们的实际情况进行试验，找到了钟摆的正确尺寸、位置和重量。
    从这一段时间的实践中，我深深体会到：坚持发扬革命的批判精神，才能破旧立新，有所创造，有所前进。那种认为洋本本上定律定理是动也动不得的想法，是形而上学的，是不符合事物发展规律的。人类社会在发展，自然界在发展，人对客观世界的认识也应该不断发展。传统的技术观念也好，书本上的公式定律也好，都是前人在一定条件下创造的，我们只有以毛泽东思想为武器，重新认识已有的结论和公式，才能在技术上有新的发展、新的创造。
      中国式周波钟是毛泽东思想的产物
    钟摆同齿轮分开以后，由于结构原理不同了，有些零件革掉了，同外国的周波钟相比，结构简单得多了。有的人看到后有些担心：“周波钟的精度要求高得很，你们现在弄得这么简单，质量能够保证吗？”好象只有复杂的东西才是精密的。这也是一种旧的观念。事实上，有些复杂的周波钟并不见得好。就拿那只从外国进口的、修正主义存心用来欺负我们的那只周波钟来说吧，它的构造十分复杂。由于复杂，就带来了消极的因素，它的齿轮比人家多，零件比人家多，不但相互牵扯，加重了钟摆的负担，而且还给使用和维修带来了很大的麻烦，真是
  “成事不足，败事有余”。事物发展的规律本来就是由简单到复杂，再从复杂到新的简单的。世界上最初的计时工具是“立竿见影”，叫做日晷，后来又发展到“铜壶滴漏”。再后来，有人创造了齿轮、发条，把钟摆同发条和齿轮联系起来，这才使钟的结构复杂起来。可是，现在不是有了不用发条、不用钟摆的电子钟了吗？我们是伟大的社会主义国家，我们有伟大的毛泽东思想作指针，我们的任何产品，都应该从制造使用方便出发，既要精密更精密，又要简单更简单。我们今天应该而且能够根据事物本来的规律，去认识事物，创造新事物。我研究对比了一九二二年到一九五八年前后的各种外国周波钟。它们的共同特点，就是结构复杂。这是跟当时的科学技术条件分不开的，是同社会制度有关系的。资本主义国家和修正主义统治的国家的周波钟，不但结构复杂，而且还有一些形式主义的复杂的零件，看起来样子很吓人，其实是毫无实用价值的。这是他们腐朽思想的产物。这种东西在我们的周波钟中根本没有。从试制周波钟的过程中，我们深刻地体会到，要制造先进产品，首先要有先进思想，要思想革命化；而思想革命化，就要用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    为了更符合我国的实际情况，把周波钟改得更加简单合理，制造使用和维修都更加方便，在党组织的支持下，我和工人同志一起，进一步进行试验。经过前后四十多次的“开刀”，把周波钟的主要零件砍掉了将近一半，有一半以上的零件降低了机械加工的技术要求。这样一来，周波钟的结构几乎比一般台钟还要简单，它的精度大大提高，赶上了最先进的水平。而且，完全可以用国产的材料，一般的钟厂都可以制造。
    在党的领导下，在同志们的共同努力和兄弟单位的热心协作下，我们第一台中国式的周波钟，终于在一九六五年九月诞生了。
    周波钟试制成功是毛泽东思想的胜利，是《实践论》和《矛盾论》的产物。现在，我们把中国式的周波钟制造出来了，但是，还有更多的中国式产品需要我们去创造。我们一定要更加自觉地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想进一步改造自己的主观世界，更好地认识、改造客观世界。
