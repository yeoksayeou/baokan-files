    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 30th - Maria, the leader of the Italian "Oriental Publishing House" visiting delegation, emphasized here: "We must grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought, which is the guarantee against US imperialism and modern revisionism, and also the guarantee for a bright future for mankind."
    She said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a profound development of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, and it reflects the reality of today's era. Mao Zedong Thought is applicable to Marxist-Leninists all over the world and is the common wealth of the people of the world." She said that we have even more reason to study Mao Zedong Thought, which is the purpose of our visit to China.
    The delegation said this when talking to Xinhua News Agency reporters about their impressions of their visit to China.
    She said: "The most profound point that Mao Zedong Thought gives me is Comrade Mao Zedong's viewpoint of class analysis, which runs through every one of his works. Constantly carrying out class analysis and formulating strategies and tactics." She cited facts to illustrate the great role of Mao Zedong Thought in China's socialist practice. She said that the recent successful third nuclear test in China and the 12,000-ton hydraulic press she saw in Shanghai are significant in illustrating that people are the determining factor. It is because the Chinese working class has grasped and applied Mao Zedong Thought that they have brought into play their creativity and have been able to accomplish amazing things. When she talked about the great achievements of the people's commune, she said that this was also based on Mao Zedong Thought, otherwise such achievements would not have been possible.
    Maria emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee against revisionism and preventing revisionism. She said: "Why did revisionism emerge in the Soviet Union? Because a privileged stratum was formed in the Soviet Union. Why is it possible that revisionism will not or cannot emerge in China? Because I see here that the wage gap in China tends to gradually narrow, cadres participate in labor, the system of half-work and half-study education, the system of both workers and peasants, and the policy of combining intellectuals with labor are being implemented. In this way, a privileged stratum cannot be produced in China. Seeing from everything that China insists on class struggle and pays attention to raising the ideological consciousness of the masses, this is the guarantee for preventing the emergence of revisionism."
    She also refuted the fallacies of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries who slander China as being increasingly "isolated". She said that the power of the revolutionary people of the world is constantly developing and growing, while imperialism and modern revisionism are full of internal contradictions. She emphasized: "The more China is 'isolated' by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, the happier we are, because China and them can absolutely not be together."
    Maria continued, in order to oppose imperialism, it is necessary to strengthen the struggle against revisionism. She said: "Opposing imperialism and opposing revisionism is an indivisible issue. Because revisionism and imperialism stand together."
    The Italian friends of the "Oriental Publishing House" delegation have ended their visit to our country and have left here to return home.

    意大利“东方出版社”代表团团长玛丽亚强调要学习毛主席著作
    毛泽东思想是全世界人民的共同财富
    掌握毛泽东思想是反帝反修和人类美好未来的保障
    新华社广州三十日电　意大利“东方出版社”访华代表团团长玛丽亚在这里强调说：“我们必须掌握和运用毛泽东思想，这是反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的保障，也是人类美好未来的保障。”
    她说：“毛泽东思想是深刻发展了的马克思列宁主义的哲学，它反映了今天时代的现实。毛泽东思想对全世界马克思列宁主义者都是适用的，是全世界人民的共同财富。”她说，所以我们有更大的理由要学习毛泽东思想，这就是我们到中国来访问的目的。
    代表团是在这里向新华社记者畅谈访华观感时这样说的。
    她说：“毛泽东思想给我最深刻的一点是毛泽东同志的阶级分析观点，这贯穿在他的每篇著作中，不断进行阶级分析，制定战略和策略。”她列举事实来说明毛泽东思想在中国社会主义实践中的伟大作用。她说，中国最近第三次核试验成功和她在上海看到的一万二千吨水压机，它们的重要意义在于说明了人是决定的因素。这是中国工人阶级掌握运用毛泽东思想才发挥了人的创造性，因此能够作出惊人的事业。她谈到人民公社取得的伟大成就时说，这也是以毛泽东思想为基础的，不然不可能取得这样的成就。
    玛丽亚强调指出，毛泽东思想是反对修正主义、防止修正主义的根本保证。她说：“苏联为什么出修正主义？因为苏联形成了一个特权阶层。中国为什么可能不出修正主义或不可能出修正主义？因为我在这里看到，中国工资差额趋于逐渐缩小的倾向，干部参加劳动，半工半读的教育制度，亦工亦农的劳动制度，知识分子与劳动相结合的政策，正在贯彻执行。这样，在中国就不可能产生特权阶层。从一切事情中看到，中国坚持阶级斗争，并注意提高人民群众的思想觉悟，这就是防止产生修正主义的保证。”
    她还驳斥了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派诬蔑中国日益“孤立”的谬论。她说，世界革命人民的力量正在不断发展壮大，而帝国主义、现代修正主义内部矛盾重重。她着重指出：“中国越被帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派所‘孤立’，我们越高兴，因为中国和它们是绝对不能搞在一起的。”
    玛丽亚接着说，为了反对帝国主义，就必须加强反对修正主义的斗争。她说：“反对帝国主义和反对修正主义是一个不可分割的问题。因为修正主义和帝国主义是站在一起的。”
     “东方出版社”代表团的意大利朋友结束了在我国的访问，已经离开这里回国。
