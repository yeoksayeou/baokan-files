    Congratulating the Successful Conclusion of the Emerging Forces Weightlifting Invitational Tournament
    The 1966 Emerging Forces Weightlifting Invitational Tournament has successfully concluded after five days of friendly and enthusiastic competition, achieving significant results. We extend our warm congratulations to all delegations with extreme excitement.
    This invitational tournament, based on the spirit of enhancing friendship, promoting mutual progress, achieving common development, and uniting against imperialism, held high the revolutionary banner against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys, headed by the United States. It fully reflected the strong desire of the people of all countries in the world to oppose the monopoly of international sports affairs by imperialism and its lackeys and to develop their sports undertakings independently and autonomously.
    More than 70 athletes, representatives, and observers from twelve countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Europe participated in this invitational tournament, making it a world-class weightlifting competition. During the competition, athletes from various countries not only improved their technical levels through the exchange of experience and mutual learning, but also enhanced their friendship and unity. This was a competition that reaped both achievements and friendship.
    It is particularly worth congratulating that, according to the unanimous wishes of all delegations, and through democratic consultation, based on the spirit of unity against imperialism, a completely new type of world international weightlifting organization—the Liaison Committee for Emerging Forces Weightlifting Competitions—was established. The establishment of this organization has created favorable conditions for better promoting the development of world weightlifting, and enhancing the friendship and unity between the people and athletes of all countries.
    In order to participate in this competition, athletes from some countries resolutely came to Beijing despite the persecution and threats from imperialism and its lackeys. They demonstrated a spirit of not fearing violence and daring to struggle, opening up a vigorous and brand-new situation for international sports activities. It shows the world that the era in which imperialists vainly attempted to monopolize and control international sports affairs is gone forever. Of course, imperialism will never be reconciled to its defeat. The International Weightlifting Federation and Bodybuilding, which it controls, will continue to issue various arrogant howls and take various despicable means to sabotage. However, as long as the people and athletes of all countries unite and persist in the struggle, any conspiracy of imperialism and its lackeys will surely be defeated.
    Unity is strength. Friends from all delegations put it well: "As long as everyone unites, the power will be greater. The International Weightlifting Federation and Bodybuilding cannot shake us"; "If everyone ignores it, the IOC and the International Weightlifting Federation and Bodybuilding will only become things for imperialism itself and will be useless"; "We must drive away imperialism like a dog"; "Let the International Weightlifting Federation and Bodybuilding and its masters go to hell"; "Emerging Forces Weightlifting Competitions must continue." With such determination, our cause will continue to develop and achieve new and greater achievements.
    Today, the revolutionary waves of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the world are rising vigorously, and the situation of US imperialism and its lackeys is becoming more and more difficult. All the reactionary international sports organizations manipulated by them are also in the same situation. Let us unite more closely in the struggle against imperialism, and work together and strive forward to develop the sports undertakings of the people of all countries and to strengthen the friendship between athletes and people of all countries!

### 祝贺新兴力量举重邀请赛胜利闭幕

    祝贺新兴力量举重邀请赛胜利闭幕
    一九六六年新兴力量举重邀请赛，经过五天友好而热烈的比赛，取得了重大的成就，已经胜利闭幕了。我们怀着极其兴奋的心情，向各代表团致以热烈的祝贺。
    这次邀请赛，以增进友好、互相促进、共同发展、团结反帝的精神为基础，高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义及其走狗的革命旗帜，充分反映了世界各国人民反对帝国主义及其走狗垄断把持国际体育事务、要求独立自主地发展体育事业的强烈愿望。
    参加这次邀请赛的，有来自亚洲、非洲和欧洲的十二个国家和地区的七十多位选手、代表和观察员，是一次世界性的举重比赛。在比赛中，各国运动员通过交流经验、互相学习，不仅提高了彼此的技术水平，并且增进了友好团结。这是一次成绩和友谊双丰收的竞赛。
    特别值得祝贺的是，根据各代表团的一致愿望，经过民主协商，本着团结反帝的精神，成立了一个完全新型的、世界性的国际举重组织——新兴力量举重比赛联络委员会。这个组织的建立，为更好地推动世界举重运动的发展，增进各国人民和运动员之间的友谊和团结，创造了良好条件。
    为了参加这次比赛，一些国家的运动员是在不顾帝国主义及其走狗的迫害和威胁的情况下，毅然来到北京的。他们表现了不畏强暴、勇于斗争的精神，为国际体育活动打开了一个生气勃勃的崭新的局面。它向全世界表明：帝国主义者妄想垄断和控制国际体育事务的时代已一去不复返了。当然，帝国主义是决不会甘心它们的失败的。它们控制的国际举重与健身联合会还会不断地发出各种狂妄的叫嚣，采取各种卑劣的手段进行破坏。但是，只要各国人民和运动员团结一致，坚持斗争，帝国主义及其走狗的任何阴谋都是一定能够被挫败的。
    团结就是力量。各代表团的朋友们说得好：“只要大家联合起来，力量就大了。国际举重与健身联合会是不能动摇我们的”；“大家都不理它，奥委会和国际举重与健身联合会就只成了帝国主义自己的东西，没什么用了”；“我们要把帝国主义象狗一样地赶走”；“让国际举重与健身联合会和它的主子去见鬼吧”；“新兴力量举重比赛一定要继续下去”。有了这样的决心，我们的事业一定会继续向前发展，取得新的和更大的成就。
    今天，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命浪潮，正在风起云涌，美帝国主义及其走狗的处境越来越困难。为它们所操纵的一切反动的国际体育组织，也陷于同样的境况。让我们在反对帝国主义的斗争中更加紧密地团结起来，为发展各国人民的体育事业，为加强各国运动员和人民之间的友谊，共同努力，奋勇前进！
