    Telegram from the Capital's People of All Circles Supporting the Palestinian People's Anti-American Struggle Conference
    The Chinese People Are the Most Reliable Comrades-in-Arms of the Palestinian People

    Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- The Support Telegram passed by the Capital's People of All Circles Supporting the Palestinian People's Anti-American Struggle Conference. The full text is as follows: To the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian People:

    Today, people from all circles in Beijing, the capital of China, are holding a grand rally, and in the name of the entire Chinese people, express our highest and fraternal respect to the heroic Palestinian Arab people, express our most resolute support to the Palestinian Arab people who are persistently struggling against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, and striving to return to their homeland, and express our most resolute support to the people of Arab countries who are tenaciously struggling against imperialism headed by the United States and new and old colonialism, and striving for and safeguarding national independence.

    The Palestinian issue was entirely created by U.S. and British imperialism manipulating the United Nations. For more than a decade, U.S. imperialism has used Israel, this tool of aggression, to brazenly provoke Arab countries, threatening the independence of Arab countries and the security of the Asian and African regions. Now, U.S. imperialism is stepping up the arming of Israel, while actively peddling the Arab-Israeli "peace talks" conspiracy, vainly attempting to force the Arab people to abandon their struggle, so as to realize its sinister attempt to perpetually oppress and enslave the Arab people. It is worth noting that the Soviet revisionist leading clique, posing as "friends" of the Arab people, is colluding with U.S. imperialism and Zionism, engaging in the shameful act of false support but real betrayal. It is actually acting as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism, playing the role of a saboteur of the Arab people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. Today, the Arab people have become increasingly awakened. No matter what conspiracies U.S. imperialism and its accomplices play, they will never intimidate or deceive the Arab people. The Arab people will wage a more resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its partners until final victory!

    The Palestinian Arab people and the Arab countries' people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, and for national independence is a component of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. In your just anti-imperialist struggle, the 650 million Chinese people will always be your most loyal and reliable comrades-in-arms. Like our support for all revolutionary people's struggles, we consistently and resolutely support your struggle, and we will certainly support it to the end! Similarly, your struggle has also constantly encouraged and supported us. The anti-imperialist fighting friendship and unity between the Chinese people and the Palestinian Arab people and the Arab countries' people cannot be undermined by any reactionary forces. It will be consolidated and developed in the struggle. We firmly believe that the Palestinian Arab people, who are determined to control their own destiny, will strengthen unity, persevere in the struggle, and, with the support of the people of Arab countries and the people of the world, will finally realize the sacred aspiration of returning to their homeland and restoring their legitimate rights.

    The heroic Palestinian Arab people and the Arab countries' people will surely win!
    U.S. imperialism and its partners are bound to fail!

    首都各界支持巴勒斯坦人民反美斗争大会通电
    中国人民是巴勒斯坦人民最可靠的战友
    新华社二十日讯　首都各界人民支持巴勒斯坦人民反美斗争大会通过的支持电。全文如下：巴勒斯坦解放组织并巴勒斯坦人民：
    今天中国首都北京各界人民隆重集会，并以全中国人民的名义，向英勇的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民致崇高的、兄弟的敬意，向为反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列、争取重返家园而坚持斗争的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民表示最坚决的支持，向为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立而顽强斗争的阿拉伯各国人民表示最坚决的支持。
    巴勒斯坦问题完全是美英帝国主义操纵联合国一手造成的。十几年来，美帝国主义利用以色列这个侵略工具，狂妄地向阿拉伯国家进行挑衅，威胁着阿拉伯各国的独立和亚非地区的安全。现在，美帝国主义正加紧武装以色列，同时积极兜售阿拉伯—以色列“和谈”阴谋，妄图迫使阿拉伯人民放弃斗争，实现其永远压迫和奴役阿拉伯人民的罪恶企图。值得人们警惕的是，苏联修正主义领导集团冒充阿拉伯人民的“朋友”，但却同美帝国主义和犹太复国主义勾勾搭搭，干着假支持真出卖的可耻勾当。它实际上充当着美帝的帮凶，它起着阿拉伯人民反帝革命斗争的破坏者的作用。今天，阿拉伯人民已经日益觉醒，美帝国主义及其帮凶尽管玩弄种种阴谋，绝吓不倒、也欺骗不了阿拉伯人民。阿拉伯人民必将对美帝国主义及其合伙者进行更加坚决的斗争，直到取得最后胜利！
    巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列、争取和维护民族独立的斗争是全世界人民革命斗争的组成部分。在你们的反帝正义斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民永远是你们最忠实、最可靠的战友。对你们的斗争，正象对一切革命人民的斗争一样，我们始终不渝，坚决支持，而且一定支持到底！同样，你们的斗争也不断鼓舞和支持了我们。中国人民同巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民之间的反帝的战斗友谊和团结，是任何反动势力所破坏不了的，它将在斗争中日臻巩固，更加发展。我们深信，决心掌握自己命运的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民必将加强团结、坚持斗争，在阿拉伯各国人民和全世界人民的支援下，最后实现重返家园和恢复自己合法权利的神圣愿望。
    英勇的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民必胜！
    美帝国主义及其合伙者必败！
        首都各界人民支持巴勒斯坦人民反美斗争大会
