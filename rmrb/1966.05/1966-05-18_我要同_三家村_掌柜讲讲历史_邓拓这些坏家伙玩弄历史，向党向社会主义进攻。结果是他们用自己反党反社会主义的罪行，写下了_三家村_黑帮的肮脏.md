    I Want to Talk to the Bosses of "Three-Family Village"
    Deng Tuo and these bad guys played with history, attacking the Party and socialism. In the end, they used their own crimes of being anti-Party and anti-socialist to write down the dirty history of the "Three-Family Village" black gang.
    Yang Jianfa, President of the "May 3rd" People's Commune, Shenyang City
    When I saw the materials exposing Deng Tuo's crimes of opposing the Party and socialism in the newspaper, I was furious. For the past few days, I've had a belly full of things I had to say. Now, I want to talk to the big boss of the "Three-Family Village" – Deng Tuo – about history.
        Deng Tuo Used Dead People to Speak Cryptic Words and Frenziedly Attack the Party
    I have seen some anti-Party and anti-socialist people in the past, but this fellow Deng Tuo is different from those people. That is, he waves the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, hangs the sign of Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee, and secretly shoots black guns at the people. He moved a large pile of historical "materials" and brought out a long list of dead people to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. He thought that this could deceive and scare people. In fact, Deng Tuo was wrong. We don't need to know what you're talking about, Li Sancai, Mi Wanzhong, the long hair of the imperial concubine, the birthday of the "Jade Emperor," and other messy things. What we know is the history of the working people, that is the real history.
    History is created by the working people, not fabricated by your small group of people. You talk about emperors and bureaucrats all the time, as if there are only these few people in history. The millions of suffering working people are simply not in your eyes. If you say you have them in your eyes, they are just some "dullards" and "fools" who don't understand anything and can't do anything. Deng Tuo, let me ask you first, if it weren't for us working people tilling the land to produce grain, spinning yarn, and weaving cloth, how many days could those emperors and generals you praise as great Bodhisattvas live? Where would the "glorious history" of emperors and generals and the "unyielding spirit" of bureaucrats come from to be your capital for opposing the Party and opposing socialism!
    If it weren't for us working people working hard, could those "jacks-of-all-trades" and those who wielded pens and painted pictures have the spirit to read and write, shake their heads and wag their tails, and spout nonsense? What would you eat and wear if it weren't for what we working people produce? The working people provide you with education to study history, but you betray us, sit in the office, and spend all day wielding a pen to come up with tricks, using dead people to speak cryptic words, scolding our Party, scolding our socialism, and vainly trying to turn back the clock, restore capitalism, and make the working people slaves again, oppressed and exploited. This will never be allowed.
    In your anti-Party and anti-socialist general store of *Yanshan Night Talks*, *Notes from Three-Family Village*, etc., you describe Li Sancai, the executioner who suppressed the peasant uprising, as a great hero who "attacked the dark feudal rule"; you describe Mi Wanzhong, a big landlord and high-ranking bureaucrat, as a person who was "clean in government and concerned about civil and criminal matters." These people are wolves in human skin, and their hands are stained with the blood of countless working people. You say that in the past some emperors, landlords, and bureaucrats treated the people well, but I say that all crows in the world are black. From ancient times to the present, there have never been any kind-hearted heads of the exploiting classes. I don't know much about other things, but I know a lot about the things of the old society where people eat people. I don't need to talk about others, just my own things, and I can't finish talking about them in three days and three nights. Our ancestors have worked for the landlords for generations, and the grain they harvested filled the landlords' granaries, but sometimes our whole family couldn't even drink a bowl of thin porridge. I begged for food everywhere with my mother since I was a child, and I worked for the landlord when I was fourteen years old. I could only bring a mouth, and my mother and sister at home still had to beg for food. In that kind of society, I don't know how many people like me there were. Yang Shixin, the Party branch secretary of the Fifth Production Team of the Nantag Brigade in our commune, was driven to a dead end by the landlord in the old society. His family of six sold an older sister and a younger sister, his mother starved to death, his younger brother froze to death, his father ran from the countryside to the city to work, and was also tortured to death by the foreman. In the end, only Yang Shixin was left. He survived to the new society, but his arm was already crippled from exhaustion. In the past, landlords didn't treat us poor people as human beings at all. When the hired workers ate, the landlord sent lackeys to watch, for fear that they would eat too much and take the cornbread away. The landlord was also afraid that the poor and lower-middle peasants would draw water from his vegetable garden and well, so he sprinkled manure in the well. Aren't all these things done by the kind of people you praise day and night! In the old society, the exploiters and the exploited, the oppressors and the oppressed, were always enemies who could not stand each other. You keep telling us to learn what "morality" and what "backbone" from them, and you even say that the present is not as good as the past! This just shows that you are obsessed with opposing the Party and socialism.
      Deng Tuo's Statement That the New Society Does Not Cherish Labor is a Distortion of the Truth
    You say that ancient politicians knew how to cherish and save labor, and that our new society does not cherish and save labor, which is a deliberate distortion of the truth by you. How did the landlords "cherish" labor? When I worked for the landlord, I went out when the stars were still out and came back when the stars were still out, never seeing the sun all day long, working without straightening my back, and the landlord still put a sentry on the big tree in the middle of the ground to watch you work. An old commune member in our commune named Sun Shulin worked for the landlord for more than twenty years before liberation, his waist was bent from exhaustion, his legs were lame from exhaustion, and he was finally driven out by the landlord. The landlord only knew to call the peasants cattle and horses, and there was no cherishing of the working people at all. As for the working people who were personally tortured to death by the bureaucrats, landlords, and capitalist masters in the old society, no one knows how many there were! The working people couldn't even live if they wanted to, and those who were lucky enough to live were just skin and bones. Is this the reactionary who cherished and saved labor in the old society? When the Communist Party came, the working people were liberated and became the masters of the country. At this time, labor was truly cherished and truly saved. Our Party regards people as the most precious wealth in the world, and regards labor protection and the combination of work and rest as very important policies. This is common sense that even elementary school students know. However, Deng Tuo is telling lies with his eyes open, trying to provoke the relationship between us working people and the Party, which is really a daydream. We can never forget the bloody history of class oppression in the old society, and we can never forget the care and love of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for our working people. Not only can't we forget it, but our children and grandchildren can never forget it. You small handful of reactionaries want to obliterate class struggle, want to distort right and wrong, want to shake our infinite love and trust in the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will never agree! We must fight you to the end.
  "The Devil is One Foot Tall, the Dao is Ten Feet Tall," We Must Overthrow the Deng Tuo Black Gang
    Why do Deng Tuo and his gang of bad guys uglify the Party and attack our socialist system? I say: What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what kind of person says what kind of words. Standing on the bourgeois position that is hostile to the people, everything you see is upside down. What we say is good, they say is bad; what we say is bad, they insist is good. They can't see the past clearly, they can't see the present clearly, and they can't see the future clearly. The working people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a clear class viewpoint, stand firmly on their feet, and can not only see the history clearly, distinguish who is the enemy and who is the friend, but also see through the essence of these bad guys inside and outside your "Three-Family Village" black shop, and see through your wolfish hearts.
    You know that today is the world of the people, and blatantly and directly opposing the Party and socialism will be exposed immediately. You are afraid that the black shop will not be able to open, so you use the methods of talking about history, telling stories, and spreading knowledge to secretly form black gangs, traffic in black goods, speak black language, and open black guns. You guys are most afraid of seeing the sun, and when the light of Mao Zedong Thought shines on you, you will show your true colors. You thought that others hadn't read so many books, so you brought out a large pile of historical materials to scare people, saying that emperors and generals were amazing, saying that "jacks-of-all-trades" were the most capable people, and simply praised them to the sky. To say a thousand words, to say ten thousand words, your talking about dead people, talking about ancient people, and playing with history are the means, and opposing the Party and opposing socialism is the real purpose. You vainly try to replace the new society with the old society and ride on the heads of the people. Unfortunately, today's working people are already the masters of the country who hold the seals of power. Your idea will not be realized. The business of your "Three-Family Village" black shop has already lost everything and is completely finished!
    Deng Tuo thought he was doing it very cleverly and played many tricks to viciously attack the Party and attack socialism. Why doesn't he go and look at history? Not to mention the distant past, wasn't the Hu Feng anti-Party clique hidden very well, but wasn't it dug out! In 1957, the rightists launched a very frenzied attack on the Party, but weren't we crushed! The hearts of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements are black, and their eyes are also pitch black. Deng Tuo can't see these historical facts. Otherwise, his anti-Party and anti-socialist "anger" has attacked his heart, and he has become crazy and suffers from "amnesia" that cannot be cured even with "dog blood on the head."
    Deng Tuo and these bad guys played with history, attacking the Party and socialism. In the end, they used their own crimes of being anti-Party and anti-socialist to write down the dirty history of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. Class struggle is complex, and I say: In the future, there will still be anti-Party black gangs like "Three-Family Village" and "Four-Family Village," and there will still be guys like Deng Tuo who wear the cloak of "scholars" to oppose the Party. No matter who he is, "the devil is one foot tall, the Dao is ten feet tall," we will definitely overthrow them completely.

    我要同“三家村”掌柜讲讲历史
    邓拓这些坏家伙玩弄历史，向党向社会主义进攻。结果是他们用自己反党反社会主义的罪行，写下了“三家村”黑帮的肮脏
    历史沈阳市“五三”人民公社社长　杨建发
    我在报纸上看到邓拓反党反社会主义的罪行的材料，心里火冒三尺，气不打一处来。这几天，憋了一肚的话，非说不可。现在，我要和“三家村”的大掌柜——邓拓，讲讲历史。
        邓拓借着死人说黑话向党猖狂进攻
    我过去也见过一些反党反社会主义的人，可是邓拓这家伙和那些人还有不一样的地方。这就是他打着“红旗”反红旗，挂着市委书记处书记的招牌，在背地里向人民放黑枪。他搬了一大堆历史“材料”，抬出了一大串死人，来反党、反社会主义。他以为，这样可以蒙混人和吓唬人。其实，邓拓想错了。你讲的什么李三才、米万钟，什么贵妃的长头发，“玉皇”的生日，我们不需要知道那些乱七八糟的东西。我们知道的是劳动人民的历史，这才是真正的历史。
    历史是劳动人民创造的，不是你们那一小伙人捏造得了的。你口口声声，不是皇帝就是官僚，好象历史上就这么几个人，千千万万受苦受难的劳动人民，根本没有在你们的眼里。如果说你们眼里有，那也是一些啥也不懂啥也不能干的“呆子”、“傻子”。邓拓，我先问你，要是没有我们劳动人民种地打粮，纺纱织布，你当作大菩萨吹捧的那些帝王将相能活几天？那还有什么帝王将相的“光荣历史”，什么官僚的“傲骨”，作为你反党反社会主义的本钱！
    要是没有我们劳动人民辛苦劳动，你抬出的那些“杂家”，那些耍笔杆的，画画的，能有精神去识文断字，摇头晃脑，胡吹乱耪吗？没有我们劳动人民生产出来的东西，你吃啥，穿啥？劳动人民供你念书学历史，你却背叛了我们，坐在办公室里，整天价耍笔杆想鬼招，借着死人说黑话，骂我们的党，骂我们的社会主义，妄想走回头路，使资本主义复辟，让劳动人民重新当牛做马、受压迫挨剥削。这是万万办不到的。
    在你那些《燕山夜话》、《三家村札记》等反党反社会主义的杂货铺里，把镇压农民起义的刽子手李三才，说成是“攻击封建黑暗统治”的大英雄；把大地主和大官僚米万钟，说成是“为政清廉，关心民刑”的人。这些人都是披着人皮的狼，他们手上不知沾了多少劳动人民的鲜血。你说过去有些皇帝、地主官僚对人民怎样怎样好，我说天下老鸦一般黑，从古到今，根本没有什么好心肠的剥削阶级统治头头。讲别的我知道的不多，讲旧社会人吃人的事，我知道的不少。不用讲别人，就是我自己的事，三天三夜也讲不完。我们祖祖辈辈都给地主扛活，打的粮食装满了地主的粮仓，有时我们全家连一碗稀粥都喝不上。我从小跟母亲到处讨饭，十四岁就给地主扛活，只能带出一张嘴，家里的母亲和妹妹还得要饭吃。在那种社会里，象我这样的人不知有多少。我们公社南塔大队第五生产队党支部书记杨士新，在旧社会被地主逼得走投无路。一家六口，卖掉了一个姐姐，一个妹妹，饿死了母亲，冻死了弟弟，父亲从乡下跑到城里去做工，也被工头给折磨死了，最后只剩下杨士新自己。他熬到了新社会，胳膊已累成了残废。过去，地主拿我们穷人根本不当人待，扛活的伙计们吃饭，地主派狗腿子看着，怕吃多了，怕把窝窝头拿走了。地主还怕贫雇农到他菜地井里打水，往井里撒大粪。所有这些不正是你黑天白日吹捧的那类人物干的吗！在旧社会，剥削人的和被剥削的，压迫人的和被压迫的，从来就是势不两立的冤家对头。你张口闭口让我们向他们学什么“品德”呀，什么“骨气”呀，还讲什么现在不如过去呀！这正说明你反党反社会主义迷了心窍。
      邓拓说新社会不爱护劳动力是颠倒黑白
    你说古代的大政治家懂得爱护、节约劳动力，我们新社会不爱护、节约劳动力，这是你有意地颠倒黑白。地主是怎样“爱护”劳动力的？我给地主扛活，都是顶着星星出去，顶着星星回来，两头不见日头，整天不直腰地干，地主还在地当腰的大树上放哨看着你干活。我们公社有个老社员叫孙树林，解放前给地主扛了二十多年大活，腰累弯了，腿累瘸了，最后还被地主赶出来了。地主只知道叫农民当牛做马，根本就没有什么对劳动人民的爱护。至于在旧社会里被官僚、地主、资本家老爷们亲手折腾死的劳动人民，谁也不知道有多少！劳动人民要想活命都活不成，侥幸活着的人，也是皮包着骨头。这就是旧社会反动派爱护、节约劳动力吗？共产党来了，劳动人民翻了身，成了国家的主人。这时劳动力才受到了真正的爱护，做到了真正的节约。我们党把人当做世界上第一最可宝贵的财富，把劳动保护、劳逸结合当作很重要的政策。这是连小学生都知道的常识。可是，邓拓却瞪着眼睛说瞎话，想挑拨我们劳动人民和党的关系，这真是白日做梦。旧社会阶级压迫的血泪史，我们永远不能忘记，共产党和毛主席对我们劳动人民的关怀和爱护，我们永远不能忘记。不但我们这辈人不能忘记，就是我们的子子孙孙也永远不能忘记。你们一小撮反动分子，想抹煞阶级斗争，想颠倒黑白，想动摇我们对共产党和毛主席的无限热爱和信任，我们坚决不答应！我们一定要和你们斗争到底。
  “魔高一尺，道高一丈”，一定要把邓拓黑帮斗垮
    邓拓这一伙坏家伙，为什么丑化党，攻击我们的社会主义制度？我说：什么藤结什么瓜，什么人说什么话。站在和人民为敌的资产阶级立场上，看什么都是颠倒的。我们说好的，他们就说是坏的；我们说是坏的，他们就硬说是好的。他们不但看不清过去，也看不清现在，更看不清将来。用毛泽东思想武装起来的劳动人民，阶级观点鲜明，立场站得稳，不仅能够看清楚历史，能分清谁是敌人、谁是朋友，也能看透你们“三家村”黑店里里外外这帮坏家伙的本质，看透你们的虎狼心肠。
    你们知道，今天是人民的天下，明目张胆、直来直去地反党反社会主义，一下子就要露馅。你们怕黑店开不成，就用说历史、讲故事、传知识的方法，偷偷摸摸地结黑帮，贩黑货，讲黑话，开黑枪。你们这帮家伙最怕见太阳，用毛泽东思想的光芒一照，你们就现出原形了。你们以为别人没读那么多书，就搬出一大堆历史材料来吓唬人，说什么帝王将相了不起，说什么“杂家”是最有本事的人，简直把他们捧上了天。说一千，道一万，你们谈死人、讲古人、搬弄历史是手段，反党反社会主义是真正的目的。你们妄想用旧社会代替新社会，骑在人民的头上。可惜，今天的劳动人民，早已是掌握了印把子的国家主人。你的主意实现不了。你们“三家村”黑店的买卖已经赔得净光，连根完蛋了！
    邓拓自以为做得挺聪明，耍了许多花招，恶毒地攻击党、攻击社会主义。他怎么不去看看历史呢？远的不说，胡风反党集团藏得很隐蔽，不是被挖出来了吗！一九五七年，右派向党进攻十分猖狂，不是被我们粉碎了吗！反党反社会主义分子的心是黑的，两眼也是墨黑的。邓拓是看不清这些历史事实的。要不，就是他反党反社会主义的“火气”攻心，到了发疯的程度，患了用“狗血淋头”也治不好的“健忘症”。
    邓拓这些坏家伙玩弄历史，向党向社会主义进攻。结果是他们用自己反党反社会主义的罪行，写下了“三家村”黑帮的肮脏历史。阶级斗争是复杂的，我说：今后也还会有“三家村”、“四家村”之类的反党黑帮，还会有邓拓这类披着“学者”外衣来反党的家伙。不管他是谁，“魔高一尺，道高一丈”，我们一定会把他们彻底斗垮。
