    The Great Leap Forward is Good!
    I will Fight to the End Against Anyone Who Opposes the Party and Chairman Mao
    Xia Juhua, Representative of the National People's Congress, Actress of the Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe
    Deng Tuo viciously attacked our great Party, saying that the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind was "great empty talk," slandering our Party as "unworthy of trust," and falsely accusing our socialist construction cause of being "finished." This is purely nonsense.
    Speaking as an acrobat, I used to live a bitter life, treated worse than a beast of burden, constantly wandering, with no home to return to. In order to make a living, I was once forced to endure the pain of performing "hanging by braids." Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao did our people achieve complete liberation, and I, an acrobat, achieved a complete political turnaround. Under the loving care of the Party and Chairman Mao, our acrobatic art has also made great achievements in the past sixteen years. Especially during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, our acrobatic art created programs and movements that our predecessors dared not imagine. For example, several movements in my bowl-balancing act were created under the inspiration of the Great Leap Forward.
    Our domestic socialist construction, the great development of industry and agriculture, has achieved one great victory after another. The recent successful nuclear explosion is a victory of the Party and a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It has inspired the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao enjoys extremely high prestige not only at home but also abroad. I have been abroad many times and have personally witnessed our country's international prestige growing higher and higher. Our acrobatic troupe has traveled to many countries and many places. At the end of the performance, people shouted: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Their excited feelings fully expressed their love and respect for Chairman Mao. People all over the world yearn for Beijing and yearn for Chairman Mao. When we performed in Italy, a worker said: "The world revolution is pinned on China and on Chairman Mao. I wish you greater prosperity."
    All these facts are what we have seen with our own eyes. These all prove that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, socialism is thriving, and the Great Leap Forward is good! But Deng Tuo and other anti-Party gangs falsely accuse our socialist construction cause of being "finished," saying that we are "an estate of one egg." Facts show that it is not us who are finished, but American imperialism, revisionism, and the likes of Deng Tuo who are finished.
    Deng Tuo and his gang of reactionary elements extremely hate the Communist Party and our great leader Chairman Mao and want to destroy our socialism. This is impossible, absolutely impossible. I was cultivated by the Party, and I resolutely listen to the Party. I will go wherever the Party points. If anyone opposes the Party and Chairman Mao, I will fight him to the end. Deng Tuo has been attacking us for a long time, and now it is time for us to counterattack.

    大跃进就是好
    谁要反对党和毛主席，我就同他拼到底
    全国人民代表大会代表武汉市杂技团演员  夏菊花
    邓拓恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党，说东风压倒西风是“伟大的空话”，诽谤我们的党“不堪信任”，诬蔑我们的社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了。这纯粹是胡说八道。
    以我这个杂技演员来说，过去过的痛苦不堪的生活，牛马不如，处处流浪，无家可归。为了混饭吃，曾被迫忍痛作“吊辫子”的表演。只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们全国人民才彻底得到了解放，我这个杂技演员在政治上也彻底翻了身。在党和毛主席的亲切关怀下，十六年来，我们杂技艺术，也取得了很大的成绩。特别是在一九五八年大跃进的时候，我们杂技艺术，创造了前人不敢想象的节目和动作，如我的顶碗中的几个动作，就是在大跃进的鼓舞下创造出来的。
    我们国内的社会主义建设，工农业大发展，取得了一个又一个的伟大的胜利。最近的核爆炸成功就是党的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。它鼓舞了全世界革命的人民。毛主席不仅在国内就是在国外也享有极高的威信。我曾多次出国，亲眼看到了我国国际威望越来越高。我们杂技团走过很多国家、很多地方。在演出谢幕时，人们都高喊：“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”他们那种激动的心情，充分表达了对毛主席的热爱和尊敬，世界人民向往着北京，向往着毛主席。当我们在意大利演出时，有一位工人说：“世界革命寄托在中国的身上，寄托在毛主席的身上，祝你们日益昌盛。”
    这一切事实是我们亲眼所见。这些都证明东风劲吹西风衰，社会主义蒸蒸日上，大跃进就是好！可是邓拓等反党黑帮却诬蔑我们社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了，说我们是“一个鸡蛋的家当”。事实说明，完蛋的不是我们，完蛋的是美帝国主义、修正主义和邓拓之流。
    邓拓一伙反动分子，极端仇视共产党和我们伟大领袖毛主席，想把我们的社会主义毁掉，这是办不到的，万万办不到的。我是党一手培养起来的，我坚决听党的话，党指向那里我就奔向那里。谁要是反对党和毛主席，我就和他拼到底。邓拓已经很早就向我们进攻了，现在是该我们反击的时候了。
