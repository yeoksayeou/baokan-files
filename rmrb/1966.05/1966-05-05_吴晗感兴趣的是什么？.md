    After reading the materials in the *People's Daily*, "Please Look at Wu Han's Political Face Before Liberation!", we feel extremely indignant at Wu Han's words and actions. It turns out he is a sinister and vicious fellow who has consistently opposed the Party, the people, and socialism.

    In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, supported by American imperialism, launched a full-scale civil war. Wu Han, however, advertised a "third party" stance, equating the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Kuomintang with the revolutionary self-defense war led by our Party. On the surface, he seemed to favor neither side, criticizing both the Communist Party and the Kuomintang. However, his attitude at the time was actually to excuse the guilt of the American-Chiang reactionaries in launching the civil war, standing on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie and acting as a counter-revolutionary "vanguard."

    Wu Han used the tone of "we the people" in his article to severely scold our Party. We can't help but ask: Wu Han, are you worthy to represent the people? Our people have always loved the Party and Chairman Mao, and actively plunged into the torrent of the people's revolutionary war. How can you say that they are not interested in our Party history, Party program, and Party propaganda? Our people are interested. It is precisely you, a small handful of loyal running dogs of the US and Chiang, who are not interested.

    We also want to ask Wu Han, what are you interested in? From your historical materials, it can be clearly seen that you are interested in: First, being pro-Chiang. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, you viciously insulted and attacked the anti-Japanese national salvation movement as "window dressing," "showing off," "a craze," and "scattered like birds and beasts," serving Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance and plotting for the "long-term stability" of the Kuomintang reactionaries, urging Chiang Kai-shek to learn from "historical lessons" and devote all efforts to eliminate the Communist Party. During the Liberation War, you, under the guise of a "third party," helped Chiang Kai-shek with minor criticisms and major support, opposing the People's Liberation War and vainly attempting to reverse the wheels of history. Second, worshiping America. You fantasized about establishing a bourgeois dictatorship in China according to the American model, praising American bourgeois democracy, touting Roosevelt's "Four Freedoms," and wanting "us to learn" from America's "democratic methods" to establish a "free world." Third, being anti-communist. Before liberation, you stood on the reactionary position of being pro-Chiang and worshiping America, viciously attacking our great Party and opposing our Party. After liberation, from the articles you wrote such as *Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor* and *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, we can see that what you are interested in is still the same old merchandise you peddled in the past, truly "ten thousand changes without departing from the original principle." You used the form of writing plays and articles to, in a planned and purposeful way, coordinate with right-leaning opportunists to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, the people, and socialism. The above is your "interest."

    Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." Mao Zedong Thought has given us a pair of "fiery golden eyes." No matter what kind of face Wu Han puts on, he can never deceive the revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

    吴晗感兴趣的是什么？
                     邓宝丞　孔根林
    我们读了《人民日报》《请看吴晗解放前的政治面目！》的材料后，对吴晗的言行，感到极大的愤慨。原来他是一个一贯反党、反人民、反社会主义的阴险毒辣的家伙。
    一九四六年，蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下，发动了全面内战。吴晗却标榜“第三者”立场，把国民党发动的反革命内战和我党所领导的革命自卫战争，相提并论。他表面上好象都不偏袒，既指责共产党，又指责国民党，但是，他当时的这种态度，实际是为美蒋反动派发动内战开脱罪责，是站在资产阶级的反动立场上，充当反革命的“急先锋”。
    吴晗在文章中以“我们人民”的口吻来大骂我们的党，我们不禁要问：吴晗，你配代表人民吗？我们的人民一贯热爱党、热爱毛主席，积极投入到人民革命战争的洪流中去，怎能说对我们的党史、党纲、党的宣传品不感兴趣呢？我们人民是感兴趣的，不感兴趣的，正是你们这一小撮美、蒋的忠实走狗们。
    我们还要问吴晗，你感兴趣的又是什么呢？从你的历史材料中，可以清楚地看出，你感兴趣的：一是亲蒋。在抗日战争时期，你恶毒辱骂、攻击抗日救亡运动是“装门面”、
  “显时髦”、“一窝蜂”、“鸟兽散”，为蒋介石不抵抗反动政策效劳，并为国民党反动派
  “长治久安”出谋献策，要蒋介石吸取“历史教训”，全力以赴消灭共产党。在解放战争时期，你打着“第三者”的幌子，对蒋介石小骂大帮忙，反对人民解放战争，妄想倒转历史车轮。二是崇美。幻想按照美国的样子，在中国建立资产阶级专政，颂扬美国的资产阶级民主，吹捧罗斯福的“四大自由”，要“我们学习”美国的“民主方法”，建立一个“自由世界”。三是反共。解放前，你站在亲蒋、崇美的反动立场上，恶毒攻击我们伟大的党，反对我们的党。解放后，从你写的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》等文章中，看到你所感兴趣的仍然是过去所贩卖的货色，真是“万变不离其宗”。你利用写戏、写文章的形式，有计划、有目的地配合右倾机会主义分子，向党、向人民、向社会主义猖狂进攻。以上就是你的“兴趣”。
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”毛泽东思想使我们长了一副“火眼金睛”，吴晗不管装出一副什么样的嘴脸，都休想骗过用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士。
