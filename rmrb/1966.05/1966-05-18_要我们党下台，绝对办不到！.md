    It's Absolutely Impossible to Make Our Party Step Down!
    Han Chaxian, National Model Worker in Industry, Female Loom Operator at Beijing Velvet Carpet Factory
    Upon hearing Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk, I felt extremely angry and had many things I wanted to say.
    That fellow Deng Tuo, in his black talk, viciously slandered our great Party as suffering from "amnesia," "feigning madness," and being "untrustworthy." He frantically shouted that our Party "must quickly take a complete rest, not say anything, not do anything," and obey their "guidance" in everything. We see through Deng Tuo's wolfish heart and dog-like lungs. His aim is to seal the mouths of our Party and our working class so that they can talk nonsense themselves, to bind the hands and feet of our Party and our working class so that they can act recklessly. This is, in effect, to drive our Party from power, seize the seal of authority from the hands of our working class, and let their gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs take power, dragging our socialist country back onto the old road of capitalism. Let me tell you, Deng Tuo, it's a daydream to have our Party step down to "rest" and let you restore capitalism! Our working class has suffered enough in the old society and knows the sweetness of the new society. We absolutely cannot go backward!
    Thinking back to the old society, my father died when I was five, and I wandered everywhere with my mother. At seven or eight, I picked up scraps in the streets, and at nine, I became a child laborer, living a life worse than that of cattle and horses. After liberation, it was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved our family, turning me, a girl who picked up scraps in the old society, into a liberated person and master of the country. I became a member of the trade union committee and participated in the factory's management. Thanks to the Party's cultivation and education, I gloriously joined the Party in 1956. When I achieved a little success in production, the Party and the people gave me great honor, allowing me to participate in the National Congress of Heroes and even meet the beloved leader, Chairman Mao.
    From my personal experience, I deeply feel that the old society was hell for us poor people, making me live a miserable life worse than that of cattle and horses. The new society is heaven for us poor people. The Party and Chairman Mao rescued us from the sea of suffering, brought us a happy life, and led us onto the bright road of socialism. The Party is my lifeline. Without the Party, there would be no Han Chaxian, no happiness for our working class today, and none of our achievements. Now, Deng Tuo is dreaming of driving our Party from power, letting us return to that era of suffering and restoring capitalism in China. No, no, a thousand times no! Our working class absolutely will not agree, and the people of the whole country absolutely will not agree!
    Our struggle with Deng Tuo and these monsters and demons is a life-and-death class struggle. In this struggle, our working class must stand on the front line. In order to defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, and defend our socialist country, our working class will resolutely fight to the end against Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gang elements!

    要我们党下台，绝对办不到！
    全国工业劳动模范、北京绒毯厂挡车女工　韩茶仙
    听到邓拓反党、反社会主义的黑话，我非常气愤，心里有许多话很想说一说。
    邓拓这家伙在他的黑话里恶毒地污蔑我们伟大的党害了“健忘症”、“装疯卖傻”、“不堪信任”。他发了疯地叫喊要我们党“必须赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做”，一切听从他们的“指导”。我们看透了邓拓的狼心狗肺，他的目的是要封住我们党、我们工人阶级的嘴巴而让他们自己胡说八道，是要捆住我们党、我们工人阶级的手脚而让他们胡作非为。这实际上就是要把我们党赶下台去，夺取我们工人阶级手里的印把子，由他们那伙反党、反社会主义的黑帮当权，把我们社会主义的国家拉回资本主义的老路上去。告诉你邓拓，要我们党下台“休息”，由你们搞资本主义复辟，这是大白天作梦！我们工人阶级受尽旧社会的苦，深知新社会的甜，要我们走回头路，万万不能！
    回想起旧社会，我五岁死了父亲，随母亲到处流浪，七、八岁就满街拾破烂，九岁就当了童工，过着牛马不如的生活。解放后，是党和毛主席救了我们一家人，使我这个在旧社会拾破烂的女孩子翻身解放，成了国家的主人。我当了工会委员，参加了工厂的管理工作。由于党的培养、教育，一九五六年我光荣地入了党。我在生产上取得一点成绩，党和人民却给了我极大的荣誉，让我参加全国群英会，还见到敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    从我的亲身经历中，我深深地感到，旧社会是我们穷人的地狱，它使我过着牛马不如的苦难生活。新社会是我们穷人的天堂，党和毛主席把我们从苦海中救出来，给我们带来幸福生活，领导我们走社会主义光明大道。党就是我的命根子，没有党就没有我韩茶仙，就没有我们工人阶级今天的幸福，就没有我们的一切。如今邓拓妄想把我们党赶下台去，让我们重新回到那苦难的年代，在中国复辟资本主义。不行，不行，一万个不行！我们工人阶级绝对不答应，全国人民绝对不答应！
    我们和邓拓这些牛鬼蛇神的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，我们工人阶级一定要站在最前线。为了保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，保卫我们社会主义的江山，我们工人阶级坚决和邓拓一伙反党、反社会主义的黑帮分子斗争到底！
