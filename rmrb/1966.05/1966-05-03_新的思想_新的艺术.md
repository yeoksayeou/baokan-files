    New Thoughts, New Art

    After seeing the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," I felt that the theme had developed. Yang Bailao and Xi'er possessed more of the rebellious and combative nature of poor peasants, and lacked the weeping and wailing weakness. This adaptation is very good. This point is precisely where the ballet can once again give people a profound education. Without mentioning other things, let me give two details as examples. After Xi'er was snatched into the Huang family, she used a duster to dust the chairs. After dusting a few times, she resentfully threw the duster away. When the landlord Huang Shiren wanted to harass Xi'er, Xi'er picked up the incense burner in uncontrollable anger and smashed it at Huang Shiren. Every look and action of Xi'er allows the audience to see the flames of class hatred deeply buried in Xi'er's heart, as well as her desire to resist and take revenge.
    The prologue also contains deep meaning. A group of poor peasants, under the whips of the landlord's lackeys, sent the grain they earned with their blood and sweat to the landlord's house. A Kuomintang military officer swaggered and was welcomed into the house by the landlord. It tells the audience that there is not only one Yang Bailao in the world, nor is there only one Huang Shiren. The Kuomintang reactionary regime and the landlord class wear the same pair of pants; they cruelly oppress and exploit the peasants. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The struggle of Yang Bailao and his daughter, as well as other revolutionary masses, against the landlord's reactionary forces, is completely reasonable.
    The ballet also made bold breakthroughs and innovations in form, adding accompaniment singing. Before seeing this play, I also wondered, is it good to add accompaniment singing to ballet? After seeing it, not only were the doubts dispelled, but it was felt that in some places, precisely because accompaniment singing was added, the plot became more infectious to the audience. For example, in the third scene, Xi'er suffered all kinds of humiliation in the Huang family and escaped from the Huang family with unbearable suffering. I was wondering what Xi'er would do after escaping. At this time, the music suddenly added the accompaniment singing of "I will not die, I want to live, I want to take revenge." After listening, I felt a sigh of relief. The accompaniment singing expressed Xi'er's strong spirit of resistance and also expressed the audience's feelings.

    新的思想　新的艺术

    看了芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，觉得主题有了发展，杨白劳和喜儿的身上多了贫农的反抗性和斗争性，缺了哭哭啼啼的软弱性，这样改编很好。这一点，也正是舞剧能再一次给人深刻教育的地方。别的不说，举两个细节做例子。喜儿被抢到黄家后，用掸子掸椅子，掸不几下，就恨恨地把掸子扔了；地主黄世仁要调戏喜儿，喜儿怒不可遏地拿起香炉砸黄世仁。喜儿的每个眼神和动作，都让观众看到深深埋藏在喜儿心里的阶级仇恨的烈火，以及她要反抗、要报仇的斗争性。
    序幕包含的意义也很深。一群穷苦农民在地主狗腿子的皮鞭下，把自己血汗换来的粮食往地主家送，一个国民党军官耀武扬威地被地主迎进了家门。它告诉观众，天底下不只一个杨白劳，也不只一个黄世仁。国民党反动政权和地主阶级同穿一条连裆裤，他们残酷压迫农民、剥削农民。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，杨白劳父女俩以及其他革命群众反抗地主反动势力的斗争，是完全合情合理的。
    舞剧在形式上也作了大胆的突破和创新，加了伴唱。看这个剧之前，我也想过，芭蕾舞加伴唱，好不好？看了以后，不但疑问打消了，而且觉得有的地方正是由于加进了伴唱，才使得剧情更加感染观众。比如第三场，喜儿在黄家受尽凌辱，忍无可忍从黄家逃出来。我正在想喜儿逃出来以后又怎么办呢？这时，音乐忽然加进“我不死，我要活，我要报仇”这几句伴唱，听后就觉得舒了一口气。伴唱把喜儿坚强的反抗精神唱出来了，也把观众的心情唱出来了。
