    *The White Haired Girl* Educated Me
    Li Shanyuan, Vegetable Technician of Lugouqiao People's Commune, Beijing Model Worker
    I am an old peasant over sixty years old. I have little education and little knowledge. As for ballet, a foreign thing, I had not only never seen it before, but I had never even heard of it. When I heard that I was invited to watch the ballet *The White Haired Girl* and asked to give my opinion on the play, I felt quite nervous: Could a peasant like me, so unsophisticated, understand this foreign thing? Unexpectedly, I not only understood it, but I also loved watching it. This is a good play. I can't speak the language of intellectuals, those terms, but I will talk about my feelings and the education I received after watching this play.
    In the old society, the countryside was the world of landlords and despots, and the land was the land of landlords and despots. Landlords rode on the heads of us peasants, acting rampantly. Which poor peasant hadn't suffered the kind of crime that Yang Bailao and Xi'er suffered? Take my family as an example. My family has been farming for landlords for generations. The whole family worked hard for a year, but the harvested grain couldn't fill our own stomachs. We had to carry the grain to the landlord's house, just like in the play. I myself started working for the landlord when I was ten years old. The black-hearted landlord bullied me in every possible way. If he was not satisfied, he would whip, kick, and punch me. The hearts of the poor people all over the world are linked together. When I saw Yang Bailao beaten to death by the landlord's henchmen, and Xi'er being beaten and abused in the landlord Huang Shiren's house, I thought: This is not a play, isn't it just the bitter life we poor peasants lived in the old society? I couldn't help clenching my fists, wanting to punch Huang Shiren a few times. When I saw the Eighth Route Army liberated Yanggezhuang and brought Xi'er back from the cave, and then suppressed the two bad guys, Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi, I finally relieved the hatred and resentment in my heart. I feel that this play, from beginning to end, portrays the real things of us peasants, and says all the words I wanted to say in my heart. This play educates us not to forget the crimes of the landlord class, not to forget class hatred; it educates us that the people's country did not come easily, and we must hold on to the seals of power.

    《白毛女》给我的教育
    芦沟桥人民公社蔬菜技术员、北京市劳动模范  李善元
    我是六十多岁的老庄稼人了，文化低，见识少，芭蕾舞这洋玩意儿，早先不说没看过，连听也没听说过。听说要请我看芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，还要我对这个剧谈点意见，我心里直发怵：这洋玩意儿象我这样土里土气的农民能看得懂吗？没曾想到，不只能看懂，我还挺爱看呢。这是个好戏。我说不来文化人说的那些道理，那些名词儿，我就说说我看了这个戏以后的感想和受到的教育吧。
    旧社会的农村，天是地主恶霸的天，地是地主恶霸的地。地主骑在我们农民头上，横行霸道。杨白劳和喜儿遭的那份罪，哪个穷苦农民没遭过？就说我家吧，我们家几辈子都是给地主种地。一家老小劳累一年，打下粮食来不能填饱自己的肚子，要象剧里那样扛着粮食往地主家送。我自己，十来岁上就给地主扛活。黑心的地主变着法儿欺侮我，一不遂意，便鞭子抽，脚踢，拳打。天下穷人心贴心，当我看到杨白劳被地主的狗腿子活活打死，喜儿在地主黄世仁家挨打受气，就想：这哪是戏，不就是我们穷苦农民在旧社会过的苦日子么？不由得把拳头捏紧，想揍黄世仁几拳。看到八路军解放了杨各庄，把喜儿从山洞里寻了回来，以后把黄世仁、穆仁智这两个坏蛋镇压了，才解了心里那股仇，那股恨。我觉着：这个剧从头至尾，演的是我们农民实实在在的事情，把我心里想说的话都说出来了，这个戏，教育我们不要忘记地主阶级的罪恶，不要忘记阶级仇恨；教育我们人民的江山得来不容易，我们要掌好印把子。
