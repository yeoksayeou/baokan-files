    The Soviet Komsomol Leadership Has Degenerated into a Tool for the Soviet Communist Party Leadership Group to Promote Revisionism
    Our Communist Youth League Will Not Send a Delegation to the 15th Congress of the Soviet Komsomol
    In its reply to the Soviet Komsomol Central Committee, our Communist Youth League Central Committee stated that you are following the Soviet Communist Party leadership group's general line of Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world, catering to the needs of U.S. imperialism's "peaceful evolution" policy, betraying the revolutionary direction and revolutionary traditions of the Soviet Komsomol founded and nurtured by the great Lenin and Stalin, betraying the fundamental interests of the Soviet youth and the Soviet people, and betraying the fundamental interests of the youth and the people of the world. The Communist Youth League of China, as an assistant to the great Marxist-Leninist Chinese Communist Party, must draw a complete line with you.
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China sent a reply on May 10th to the letter from the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol dated March 30th. The full text of the reply is as follows: Comrades of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol:
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China has received your letter of March 30th, inviting us to send a delegation to your 15th Congress.
    We must point out that in recent years, the leadership of the Soviet Komsomol has degenerated into a tool for the Soviet Communist Party leadership group to promote revisionism. You follow the Soviet Communist Party leadership group's general line of Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world, promote capitulationism and splittism in the international youth movement, and oppose China, oppose communism, oppose the people, oppose revolution, and oppose youth organizations that adhere to anti-imperialism and adhere to revolution. You cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism's "peaceful evolution" policy, serve the Soviet bourgeois privileged class, and spread decadent and declining bourgeois ideological toxins and lifestyles among Soviet youth, paving the way for capitalist restoration. You have betrayed the revolutionary direction and revolutionary traditions of the Soviet Komsomol founded and nurtured by the great Lenin and Stalin. You have betrayed the fundamental interests of the Soviet youth and the Soviet people, and betrayed the fundamental interests of the youth and the people of the world. The Communist Youth League of China, as an assistant to the great Marxist-Leninist Chinese Communist Party, must draw a complete line with you.
    It is very clear that your congress is to implement the revisionist line of the 23rd Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. You are now following the dictates of the Soviet Communist Party leadership group and are frantically engaged in an anti-China movement. Your invitation is completely malicious. Under these circumstances, we cannot send a delegation to your 15th Congress.
    The broad masses of Soviet youth and Soviet Komsomol members with glorious revolutionary traditions want revolution and want to be friendly with Chinese youth and the Chinese people. Chinese youth will, as always, strive to maintain the revolutionary friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union, based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. We firmly believe that in the common struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership group, and reactionaries of all countries, the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union, together with the revolutionary people and youth of the world, will eventually sweep away all obstacles, unite, and advance side by side.
        With comradely greetings,
                  The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China
                              May 10, 1966
        To the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol
    The full text of the letter from the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China on March 30th is as follows: Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China!
    The regular 15th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League will be held in Moscow on May 17, 1966.
    At the congress, the summary report of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League will be heard and discussed, and the tasks of the Komsomol in the coming period will be formulated.
    The Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League invites a delegation of the Communist Youth League of China, consisting of three people, to participate in the work of the congress.
    Please inform us upon receipt of the invitation, and notify us of the names of your representatives attending the 15th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League.
        With Komsomol greetings!
                      Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League

    苏联共青团领导已堕落为苏共领导集团推行修正主义的工具
    我共青团不派代表团参加苏联共青团十五次代表大会
    我共青团中央在给苏联共青团中央的复信中说，你们遵循苏共领导集团苏美合作主宰世界的总路线，适应美帝国主义“和平演变”政策的需要，背叛了伟大的列宁和斯大林所创立和培育的苏联共青团的革命方向和革命传统，背叛了苏联青年和苏联人民的根本利益，背叛了世界青年和世界人民的根本利益。中国共产主义青年团，作为伟大的马克思列宁主义的中国共产党的助手，必须同你们彻底划清界限。
    新华社十二日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会五月十日就苏联共青团中央三月三十日的来信发出一封复信。复信全文如下：苏联共产主义青年团中央委员会同志们：
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会收到了你们三月三十日的来信，邀请我们派代表团参加你们的第十五次代表大会。
    我们必须指出，这些年来，苏联共产主义青年团领导已经堕落成为苏共领导集团推行修正主义的一个工具。你们遵循苏共领导集团苏美合作主宰世界的总路线，在国际青年运动中推行投降主义、分裂主义，反华、反共、反人民、反革命、反对坚持反帝坚持革命的青年组织。你们适应美帝国主义“和平演变”政策的需要，为苏联资产阶级特权阶层效劳，在苏联青年中大肆散播腐朽没落的资产阶级思想毒素和生活方式，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。你们背叛了伟大的列宁和斯大林所创立和培育的苏联共产主义青年团的革命方向和革命传统。你们背叛了苏联青年和苏联人民的根本利益，背叛了世界青年和世界人民的根本利益。中国共产主义青年团，作为伟大的马克思列宁主义的中国共产党的助手，必须同你们彻底划清界限。
    很明白，你们这次代表大会就是为了贯彻执行苏共第二十三次代表大会的修正主义路线。你们现在正在遵照苏共领导集团的意旨，疯狂地大搞反华运动。你们对我们的邀请完全是别有用心的。在这种情况下，我们不能派代表团参加你们的第十五次代表大会。
    具有光荣革命传统的广大苏联青年和苏联共青团员是要革命的，是要同中国青年和中国人民友好的。中国青年将一如既往，为维护中苏两国人民和两国青年建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的革命友谊而努力。我们坚信，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的共同斗争中，中苏两国人民和两国青年，同全世界革命人民和青年一起，终将扫除一切障碍，团结起来，并肩前进。
        此致敬礼
                  中国共产主义青年团中央委员会
                              一九六六年五月十日
        苏联共青团中央三月三十日给
    中国共青团中央来信的全文如下：中国共产主义青年团中央委员会同志们！
    一九六六年五月十七日将在莫斯科召开全苏列宁共产主义青年团例行的第十五次代表大会。
    在代表大会上将听取和讨论全苏列宁共青团中央的总结报告和制定共青团在今后时期的任务。
    全苏列宁共青团中央邀请由三人组成的中国共产主义青年团代表团参加代表大会的工作。
    收到邀请后请告知，并将你们参加全苏列宁共青团第十五次代表大会的代表姓名通知我们。
        致以共青团的敬礼！
                      全苏列宁共青团中央书记
                            谢·巴甫洛夫（签名）
