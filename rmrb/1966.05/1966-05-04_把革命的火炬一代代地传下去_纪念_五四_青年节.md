    Today is the “May Fourth” Youth Day. With boundless excitement, we extend our congratulations to the youth of the whole country, wishing them to actively participate in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and especially to actively participate in the current Socialist Cultural Revolution, weathering storms and seeing the world in such revolutionary struggles, so as to grow better and faster.
    Mao Zedong Thought is our beacon, illuminating our path forward. In long-term revolutionary practice, the youth of our country have deeply realized that by reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can adhere to the correct political direction, highlight proletarian politics, unswervingly follow the socialist road, always be domestic revolutionaries and international revolutionaries, and do a good job in study, labor, and work. We have seen that in recent years, in the three great revolutionary movements, a large number of activists and advanced collectives who creatively study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works have emerged, and the Communist Youth League has truly become a school for studying Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Communist Youth League recently held its Third Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee, focusing on discussing how the League's work can further highlight politics. The meeting emphasized that highlighting politics means highlighting Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting called on Communist Youth League organizations at all levels, all Communist Youth League members, and the youth of the whole country to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought under the leadership of the Party, further highlight politics, better carry out the movement of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and bravely struggle for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!
    Highlighting politics is the need of the international and domestic class struggle and is the foundation of all work. Highlighting proletarian politics among young people is not only related to the development of the current revolutionary cause, but also to the cultivation and growth of the next generation, and to the fate of the country and the future of the revolution. This generation of young people is a generation that carries forward our great revolutionary cause. The people's world, won by the heroic sacrifice and bloody struggle of the revolutionary predecessors, is to be inherited by this generation of young people; the great, glorious, and arduous historical task of continuing to oppose imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism, and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, is to be shouldered by this generation of young people. This is the greatest and most profound revolution in history. This is a revolution to finally eliminate the exploiting classes and gradually reduce and even eliminate the three major differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and manual labor, and a revolution to thoroughly eliminate the ideology of the exploiting classes. This revolution requires the efforts of several generations, even more than a dozen generations, to complete. In order to pass on the torch of revolution from generation to generation, this generation of young people must first truly grow into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.
    This generation of young people grew up after the victory of the revolution and were nurtured by our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The broad masses of revolutionary youth listen to the Party's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, warmly support socialism, and have great revolutionary enthusiasm. However, at the same time, we must see that this generation of young people grew up in a relatively peaceful and stable environment, and most of them have not personally suffered the oppression and exploitation of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and lack the training of class struggle and the tempering of a hard life, so they must be allowed to go into the revolutionary struggle to weather storms and see the world, so that they can gradually become revolutionized and proletarianized. Without weathering storms and seeing the world, they cannot endure great hardships, withstand hard labor, or shoulder heavy burdens. There are also some young people who come from exploiting-class families; they must draw a clear line with their families politically and ideologically and conscientiously carry out ideological remolding. Imperialism places its hopes for "peaceful evolution" on our country's third and fourth generations. The youth of our country must take imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism as negative teachers, firmly remember class hatred, and carry the proletarian revolutionary cause through to the end.
    The key for young people to highlight proletarian politics lies in earnestly and practically studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, working hard on the word "use," vigorously promoting proletarian ideology, vigorously eliminating bourgeois ideology, and truly arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, so as to become revolutionary youth with the greatest fighting power. The work experience of the Communist Youth League branch of the Fourth Specialization of the Second Department of Harbin Institute of Technology, introduced in this newspaper today (see page six), is a vivid example of educating and cultivating young people.
    This Communist Youth League branch highlights politics and consciously places the creative study and application of Comrade Mao Zedong's works at the top of all its work. They seize the issues related to world outlook among young students, as well as other fundamental issues, and mobilize everyone to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, first helping young people solve the fundamental issue of for whom to study and for whom to serve. When young people establish the view of studying for the revolution and serving the people, and initially solve the issue of political direction, their revolutionary enthusiasm will be brought into play, and they will learn vividly and practically. In their growth, young people generally attach importance to issues such as "future, achievement, and happiness." However, many people do not fully understand what the future is, what achievement is, and what happiness is. This requires strengthening political and ideological education, so that they understand that a future of personal fame and fortune is dangerous and has no happiness; struggling for the cause of socialism and the proletarian revolution, the future is bright and far-reaching, and contributing one's wisdom and talent to such a collective cause will make achievements and is true happiness.
    Comrade Mao Zedong called on "all educated young people and student youth must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants and become one with them." The students of the Fourth Specialization of the Second Department of Harbin Institute of Technology are precisely taking Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction and going deep into the masses, deep into reality, and undergoing training in the three great revolutionary movements. If the youth of our country are to be tempered and raise their awareness in the struggle between the two classes and the two roads, they should go to factories, rural areas, shops, and military units to become workers, peasants, shop assistants, and soldiers, and especially go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to contribute to the construction of a new socialist countryside and cultivate class feelings of sharing weal and woe with the working people. In practice, the students of Harbin Institute of Technology have broken down the concept of "knowledge as private property" and are determined to learn from the workers and peasants for a lifetime and serve the workers and peasants for a lifetime. This is a change in foothold and a change in world outlook. This fully proves that only by combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving the

    把革命的火炬一代代地传下去
    ——纪念“五四”青年节
    今天是“五四”青年节。我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，向全国青年致贺，祝青年们在毛泽东思想指导下，积极参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，特别是积极参加当前的社会主义文化大革命，在这样的革命斗争中经风雨，见世面，更好更快地成长起来。
    毛泽东思想是我们的灯塔，照耀着我们前进的道路。我国青年在长期革命实践中，深切地认识到，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就能够坚持正确的政治方向，突出无产阶级政治，坚定不移地走社会主义道路，永远当国内的革命派，当国际的革命派，把学习、劳动、工作搞好。我们看到，近几年来，在三大革命运动中，大批活学活用毛泽东同志著作的积极分子和先进集体涌现出来，共青团真正成为学习毛泽东思想的学校。
    共青团最近举行了九届三中全会，着重讨论了团的工作如何进一步突出政治的问题。会议强调指出，突出政治就是突出毛泽东思想。会议号召各级共青团组织、全体共青团员和全国青年，在党的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步突出政治，更好地开展活学活用毛主席著作运动，为中国革命和世界革命的胜利而英勇奋斗！
    突出政治，是国际国内阶级斗争的需要，是一切工作的根本。在青年中突出无产阶级政治，不仅关系当前革命事业的发展，而且关系下一代的培养和成长，关系国家的命运和革命的前途。这一代青年是我们伟大革命事业承前启后的一代。革命前辈英勇牺牲、流血奋斗夺得的人民天下，要这一代的青年来继承；继续反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义，把社会主义革命进行到底的伟大、光荣、艰巨的历史任务，要这一代青年来担承。这是历史上从来没有过的最伟大最深刻的革命。这是一场要最后消灭剥削阶级，逐步缩小以至消灭工农、城乡、脑力劳动和体力劳动三大差别的革命，是一场彻底清除剥削阶级意识形态的革命。这个革命，需要几代人、十几代人的努力才能完成。为了把革命的火炬一代一代地传下去，这一代青年首先要真正成长为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    这一代青年是革命胜利以后长大的，是在我们党和毛泽东同志抚育下长大的。广大革命青年，听党的话，读毛主席的书，照毛主席的指示办事，热烈拥护社会主义，有很大的革命积极性。但是，我们同时要看到，这一代青年是在比较和平、安定的环境中成长的，大都没有亲身受过地主、资产阶级的压迫和剥削，缺少阶级斗争的锻炼和艰苦生活的磨炼，所以必须让他们到革命斗争中去经风雨，见世面，使他们逐步地革命化、无产阶级化。不经风雨，不见世面，是吃不得大苦，耐不得大劳，挑不起重担的。还有一部分青年，出身是剥削阶级家庭，他们必须从政治思想上同自己的家庭划清界限，认真进行思想改造。帝国主义把“和平演变”的希望放在我国的第三代、第四代身上。我国的青年一定要把帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义当作反面教员，牢记阶级仇恨，把无产阶级的革命事业进行到底。
    青年们突出无产阶级政治，关键在于认真地切实地学习毛泽东同志的著作，在用字上狠下功夫，大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想，真正用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，成为有最大战斗力的革命青年。今天本报介绍的哈尔滨工业大学二系四专业四年级团支部的工作经验（见第六版），就是教育和培养青年的一个生动范例。
    这个团支部突出政治，自觉地把活学活用毛泽东同志著作放在一切工作的首位。他们抓住青年学生中有关世界观的问题以及其他带根本性的问题，发动大家学习毛泽东同志著作，首先帮助青年解决为谁学习、为谁服务这个根本立场问题。青年们树立了为革命学习，为人民服务的观点，初步解决了政治方向问题，革命积极性发扬起来，就会学得生动活泼，学得深入切实。青年在成长中，普遍重视“前途、成就、幸福”等等问题。可是，什么是前途，什么是成就，什么是幸福，许多人是不甚了了的。这就要加强政治思想教育，让他们懂得为个人成名成家的前途是危险的，是没有什么幸福的；为着社会主义事业、无产阶级革命事业而奋斗，前途是光明远大的，在这样的集体事业里贡献自己的智慧和才能，就会做出成绩，才是真正的幸福。
    毛泽东同志号召“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体”。哈尔滨工业大学二系四专业四年级的学生，正是带着毛泽东同志这个指示，深入群众，深入实际，到三大革命运动中去经受锻炼的。我国青年要在两个阶级、两条道路的斗争中经受锻炼，提高觉悟，就应当到工厂、农村、商店、部队去当工人、农民、店员、战士，特别要上山下乡，为建设社会主义新农村贡献力量，培养同劳动人民同甘共苦的阶级感情。哈尔滨工业大学的学生在实践中破除了“知识私有”的观念，下定决心，向工农学习一辈子，为工农服务一辈子。这是立足点的转变，是世界观的转变。这充分证明了，青年知识分子和青年学生只有同工农兵结合，为工农兵服务，才能更好地改造自己，全心全意地为全中国人民和全世界人民服务。
    在我们国家，一个具有伟大历史意义的社会主义文化革命正在兴起。这是意识形态领域中无产阶级和资产阶级谁战胜谁的激烈而又长期的斗争，也是两个阶级争夺青年一代的斗争。广大团员和革命青年，要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，踊跃参加这场社会主义文化大革命，积极参加文学艺术、教育、历史、哲学、新闻等意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，坚决反对反党、反社会主义的资产阶级、修正主义思想，坚持用社会主义思想去占领这些阵地。我们要在这场伟大的社会主义文化大革命中，提高识别香花和毒草的能力，锻炼阶级斗争的战斗力，增强免疫力，坚持革命到底，战胜修正主义。
    共青团要在党的领导下，更好地组织和领导共青团员和广大青年，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作。要象山东临朐县李家庄团支部那样，领导得活，辅导得活，使团员和青年学得好，用得好，做到政治统帅业务，政治统帅生产，使青年们真正实现以红带专，又红又专，使他们经受得起更大的风险，更严峻的考验。我们深信，毛泽东时代的青年，一定会沿着坚定正确的政治方向，象早晨八九点钟的太阳，放射出灿烂的光辉，把革命前辈创建的无产阶级革命事业，接过来，传下去，永远革命，永不变质。
