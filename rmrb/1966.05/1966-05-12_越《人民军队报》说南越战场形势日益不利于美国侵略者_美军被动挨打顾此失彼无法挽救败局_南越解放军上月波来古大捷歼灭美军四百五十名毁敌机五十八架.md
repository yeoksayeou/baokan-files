    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th dispatch) The Vietnamese "People's Army Daily" published a commentary on the 10th, pointing out that the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces' assault warfare has developed to the enemy's lair, making the battlefield situation increasingly unfavorable to the American aggressor troops and their puppet army.
    The commentary said that during the dry season this year, when the enemy concentrated its forces on the front line, its rear was subjected to unprecedented and fierce attacks. In the first three months of this year alone, the Southern army and people inflicted seventeen heavy blows on the enemy in attacking airports, destroying more than 400 aircraft of various types, accounting for about half of the total number of American aircraft destroyed, damaged, or shot down on the southern battlefields. The attacks on the enemy behind enemy lines have effectively cooperated with the main forces in dealing heavy blows to the enemy, and have also powerfully supported the political struggle movement of the people in the southern cities.
    The commentary pointed out that the American robbers cannot deal with the people's war in South Vietnam. Because the wonder of the people's war lies in the fact that the people's armed forces are right next to the enemy, but it cannot see them; the enemy is attacked but cannot find a target to fight back. The people are the guerrillas, and the guerrillas are the people. The people are the backer, and the people are the eyes and ears. Relying on the support of the people, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces use magical tactics, always holding a sword against the enemy's back, and striking at the enemy's loopholes whenever conditions permit, and hitting accurately.
    The commentary pointed out that although the enemy still has a lot of soldiers, its tactics are often very chaotic. If it fights in the front, it cannot protect the rear; if it concentrates its forces to save the rear, it cannot protect the front. Its defeat is already determined.
    The commentary said that the people and Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have thwarted the US puppet army and its vassal troops' plot to regain the initiative in the dry season. This proves that the United States' massive increase of 250,000 troops in a short period of time cannot save the predicament or change the balance of power in its favor. In its current unfavorable situation, no matter if it adds another 100,000 or 200,000 troops, it cannot escape its passive situation and will only suffer a more disastrous defeat in the end.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th dispatch) According to a supplementary report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency: The Liberation Armed Forces of Gia Lai Province in South Vietnam simultaneously attacked the Pleiku U.S. military airport, the U.S. military barracks, and two nearby strongholds on the night of April 21st to the early morning of the 22nd, annihilating more than 500 enemy soldiers, including 450 American aggressors, and destroying and shooting down 58 American aircraft of various types, including eight fighter jets and ten C-130 heavy transport aircraft.
    The report said that that night, a Liberation Armed Forces unit attacked the Pleiku U.S. military airport, destroying 40 enemy aircraft and annihilating more than 380 enemy soldiers (almost all of whom were American soldiers). At the same time, they also attacked the U.S. military barracks in the city center, destroying part of the barracks, destroying eight jeeps, shooting down one enemy plane, and killing many American aggressor troops. Another Liberation Army unit fiercely attacked the enemy in Li Zhong County and Li Zhi area near Pleiku, leveling the Ya Demin stronghold, destroying three military vehicles of various types, and causing heavy casualties to the enemy.
    On the morning of the 22nd, the enemy hurriedly dispatched helicopters to transport a large number of U.S. puppet troops to the north of Pleiku for rescue. However, the enemy's reinforcements were fiercely intercepted by the Liberation Army and more than 110 people were killed on the spot, including 76 American aggressor troops, and 17 enemy planes were shot down.

    越《人民军队报》说南越战场形势日益不利于美国侵略者
    美军被动挨打顾此失彼无法挽救败局
    南越解放军上月波来古大捷歼灭美军四百五十名毁敌机五十八架
    据新华社河内十一日电 越南《人民军队报》十日发表一篇评论指出，越南南方解放武装力量的袭击战已经发展到敌人的巢穴，使战场的形势日益朝着不利于美国侵略军及其走狗军队的方向发展。
    评论说，今年旱季，当敌人把兵力集中到前线的时候，它的背后却遭受到空前的猛烈打击。今年头三个月，南方军民仅在袭击机场方面，就给了敌人十七次沉重的打击，击毁各种类型的飞机四百多架，约占南方各战场击毁、击伤、击落美机总数的一半。在敌人背后对敌人的袭击，有效地配合了主力部队给敌人以沉重打击，也有力地支援了南方城市人民的政治斗争运动。
    评论指出，美国强盗无法对付越南南方的人民战争。因为人民战争的奇妙之处在于，人民武装力量就在敌人的身边而它却看不到；敌人遭到袭击而找不到还击的目标。人民就是游击队，游击队就是人民。人民是靠山，人民是耳目，越南南方解放武装力量依靠人民的支持，运用神奇的打法，时刻把利剑架在敌人的背上，一有条件就找敌人的漏洞来打，打得很准。
    评论指出，虽然敌人的兵还不少，但打法经常很乱，在前面打，后面就保不住，集中起来救后面，前面又保不住。它的败局已定。
    评论说，越南南方人民和解放武装力量已经挫败了美伪军和仆从军在旱季中夺回主动权的阴谋，这一点证明：美国在一个短期间内大举增兵二十五万名，仍然挽救不了困境，改变不了双方力量的对比使之有利于它们。它在目前的不利处境下，不管再增兵十万或二十万名，也摆脱不了被动的处境，最后只能遭到更惨重的失败。
    据新华社河内十一日电据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道：越南南方嘉莱省解放武装力量在四月二十一日夜晚到二十二日凌晨，同时袭击了波来古美军机场、美军兵营和附近的两个据点，共歼灭敌军五百多名，其中包括美国侵略者四百五十名，炸毁和打落各种类型的美国飞机五十八架，其中有驱逐机八架和C—130重型运输机十架。
    报道说，当夜，一支解放武装力量袭击了波来古美军机场，炸毁敌机四十架，歼灭敌人三百八十多名（几乎全部是美军），同时，还袭击了市中心区的美军兵营，炸毁一部分营房，炸毁吉普车八辆，击落敌机一架，打死许多名美国侵略军。另一支解放军则猛烈袭击波来古附近的丽中县城和丽志地区的敌军，夷平了芽德敏据点，炸毁各种军车三辆，使敌人遭到重大伤亡。
    二十二日上午，敌人慌忙地出动直升飞机把大批美伪军运到波来古以北救援。但是，敌人的援军又遭到解放军的猛烈阻击，当场被打死一百一十多名，其中有美国侵略军七十六名，击落敌机十七架。
