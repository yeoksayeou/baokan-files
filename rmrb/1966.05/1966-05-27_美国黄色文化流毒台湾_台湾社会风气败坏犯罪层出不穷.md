    American Yellow Culture Poisons Taiwan
    Taiwan's Social Morality Declines and Crimes Emerge in an Endless Stream
    (Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, 23rd dispatch) News from Taipei: American imperialism is stepping up its cultural infiltration of Taiwan, corrupting social morality, and arousing strong dissatisfaction among Taiwan compatriots.
    Taiwanese newspapers revealed that the US invading Taiwan "Embassy's" "Information Office" and "Agricultural Revival Committee" distribute a large number of propaganda materials in Taiwan every year promoting the American way of life, such as books, newspapers, and pictorials, the contents of which are mostly descriptions of pornography, fighting, or absurd stories of demons and monsters. At the same time, American films that encourage prostitution and theft also flood the towns and villages of Taiwan.
    The US government also constantly sends "song and dance troupes," "choirs," and "musical teams" to Taiwan to perform "striptease" and "twist dances," play "frantic melodies" of "hot music," and sing American yellow songs, spreading poison in a big way.
    Under the poisoning of American culture, Taiwan's social atmosphere is deteriorating, and crime is constantly occurring. Currently, on the streets and alleys of Taiwan, one can see those "loafers" and hooligans wearing American "jeans" everywhere. They imitate the hooligan actions in American movies, doing whatever they want, causing chaos and disorder.
    Taiwanese newspapers revealed that the American's frenzied cultural aggression has aroused strong dissatisfaction among Taiwan compatriots. Many people accused American books, newspapers, movies, etc., of being "corrupting toxins" "containing yeast," and "spiritual opium," which corrodes people's will and becomes the root of crime.

    美国黄色文化流毒台湾
    台湾社会风气败坏犯罪层出不穷
    据新华社二十三日讯　台北消息：美帝国主义对台湾加紧进行文化渗透，败坏社会风气，引起台湾同胞强烈不满。
    台湾报纸透露，美国侵台“大使馆”的“新闻处”和“农复会”，每年都要在台湾散发大批宣扬美国生活方式的书报、画刊等宣传品，内容大都是描写色情、打斗或妖魔鬼怪等荒诞故事的。在这同时，诲淫诲盗的美国影片也充斥台湾的城镇乡村。
    美国政府还不断派遣“歌舞团”、“合唱团”、“音乐队”来到台湾，表演“脱衣舞”“扭摆舞”，演奏“旋律疯颠”的“热门音乐”，演唱美国的黄色歌曲，大肆散布毒素。
    在美国文化的荼毒下，台湾社会风气败坏，犯罪案件不断发生。目前，在台湾的大街小巷，到处可以看到那些穿着美国“牛仔裤”的阿飞流氓。他们模仿美国影片里的那些流氓动作，为所欲为，闹得乌烟瘴气。
    台湾报纸透露，美国疯狂的文化侵略，引起台湾同胞的强烈不满。许多人指责美国书报、电影等“是含有酵母菌”的“腐化的毒素”，是“精神鸦片烟”，它腐蚀人们的意志，成为犯罪的祸根。
