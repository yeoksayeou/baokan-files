	We Must Take Over and Pass Down Mao Zedong Thought
	Youth Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Can Farm with Hoes, Fight with Guns, and Use Pens to Attack Demons and Monsters During the Great Cultural Revolution

	From the massive facts of the "Three-Family Village" gang's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, it can be clearly seen that Deng Tuo and others tried every means to poison youth, compete with our Party for the younger generation, and serve their restoration of capitalism. This is a serious class struggle concerning the future of the Party and the country. As revolutionary youth, we must resolutely expose their conspiracies and crush their attacks in this struggle.

	Deng Tuo nonsensically said that Mao Zedong Thought is "grand empty talk," "clichés," and "untrustworthy," and opposed passing Mao Zedong Thought on to the revolutionary next generation. He maliciously said, "If we teach our descendants this skill of empty talk and cultivate such a group of experts, it will be even worse." Deng Tuo also said that "Chairman Mao has never told any of us to listen to him." Deng Tuo and others said these words with extremely sinister intentions, aiming to lead youth away from Mao Zedong Thought. But the attacks of Deng Tuo and others, like the attacks of imperialism and modern revisionism, cannot damage the great Mao Zedong Thought in the slightest. On the contrary, they have aroused our infinite love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and infinite love for Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is a great spiritual force. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will transform into a great material force. After the youth of our Li Village studied Chairman Mao's works, they were full of energy. We stood taller, saw further, liberated ourselves from our personal small worlds, and understood the principle of farming for the revolution. It is because the youth and members of our Li Village studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's other articles, and were inspired by the revolutionary spirit, that we transformed 300 mu of waterlogged land, increased grain production from more than 300 jin per mu to more than 900 jin, leveled the land, realized water conservancy, and achieved guaranteed harvests in both drought and flood. We have the most profound experience that Mao Zedong Thought has the greatest power and the highest prestige. Deng Tuo, this handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, attempts to undermine the prestige of the great Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of youth. This is like an ant trying to shake a tree, overestimating its own strength. Deng Tuo opposes passing Mao Zedong Thought on to the next generation. We must take over Mao Zedong Thought, pass it on, and let it shine forever from generation to generation.

	After studying Mao Zedong Thought, our eyes are bright and our hearts are clear. Deng Tuo wants to blur our class boundaries and disrupt our political direction. This is wishful thinking. You black gangs are our enemies. We are very clear about which class you represent. You promoted the "Biography of Poor Scholars," telling us to give these bad eggs "a certain status"; you also promoted the morality of the landlord and capitalist classes, talking a lot about "loyalty," "filial piety," and "making money," telling us youth to learn from the landlords and capitalists. Let me tell you, this is absolutely impossible. We don't need to learn any "Biography of Poor Scholars," let alone your kind of "integrity." We have communist fighters like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande as role models. We are not afraid of hardship or death, and are determined to be revolutionaries for a lifetime. You also advocated that "spare time is a free world for the first interest to gallop," luring youth to pay attention to eating, drinking, playing, and having fun, talking about cats and dogs, playing with antiques, playing mahjong, and paying attention to "beauties" and "miracles of long hair." Your conspiracy in playing this trick is to use the bourgeois lifestyle to anesthetize youth, cut off our heads with "soft knives," and bombard us with sugar-coated bullets. You are vainly trying to disarm us ideologically and engage in peaceful evolution. Our younger generation has the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and will never fall into your trap or be fooled by you. We will never forget class struggle at any time. No matter what banner you wave or what coat you wear, we will expose it all.

	The villains of the "Three-Family Village," in the class struggle to compete with the proletariat for youth, also paid special attention to poisoning educated youth. You, posing as "professors," "experts," and "authorities," encouraged youth to delve into ancient books and use "hard study" to become "famous scholars." You also, under the guise of replying to a letter from an old doctor, put forward a landlord-bourgeois academic path that combines self-study and family tradition. This is exactly the path that Hu Shi designed for Wu Han back then, and Deng Tuo is selling it to today's educated youth. This is blatant opposition to Chairman Mao's instruction that educated youth should integrate with workers and peasants, blatant obstruction of educated youth from going to the countryside to work, and opposition to educated youth participating in the three major revolutionary movements, attempting to train educated youth into bourgeois successors and tools for opposing the Party and socialism. But the vast number of educated youth listen to Chairman Mao and want to make revolution. The youth of our Li Village, following Chairman Mao's teachings, wholeheartedly integrate with the poor and lower-middle peasants, serve the poor and lower-middle peasants, and take the road of being both red and expert. They can farm with hoes, fight with guns, and today, when Deng Tuo and others are frantically attacking socialism, they have also picked up pens to fire at demons and monsters. This is how the educated youth of Li Village are, and this is how the educated youth of Linqu County are, and this is how the educated youth of the whole country are. You want to capture prisoners for the bourgeoisie among the educated youth, but your efforts are in vain.

    一定要把毛泽东思想接过来传下去
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年，拿起锄头会种田，拿起枪杆能打仗，在文化大革命中，也能拿起笔杆向牛鬼蛇神开火
    中共山东临朐县委副书记、共青团临朐县委书记前临朐县李家庄团支部书记  尹兴方
    从“三家村”的黑帮们反党反社会主义的大量事实中，可以清清楚楚地看出，邓拓等人千方百计、无孔不入地毒害青年，跟我们党争夺青年一代，为他们复辟资本主义效劳。这是一场关系到党和国家前途的严重的阶级斗争。我们是革命青年，在这场斗争中坚决揭穿他们的阴谋，粉碎他们的进攻。
    邓拓胡说毛泽东思想是“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”、“不堪信任”，反对把毛泽东思想传给革命的下一代。恶毒地说什么“假若再把这种说空话的本领教给我们的后代，培养出这么一批专家，那就更糟糕了。”邓拓还说什么“毛主席从来没有叫我们谁一定要听他的话。”邓拓等人说这些话的用心是极其阴险的，他的目的就是要引导青年离开毛泽东思想。但是邓拓等人的攻击如同帝国主义、现代修正主义的攻击一样，丝毫也损伤不了伟大的毛泽东思想，相反地更加激起了我们对党对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛主席著作的无限热爱。毛泽东思想是伟大的精神力量，毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众掌握，就会变成为伟大的物质力量。我们李家庄的青年学习了毛主席著作后，浑身是劲，我们站得高了，看得远了，从个人的小天地里解放出来，懂得了为革命种田的道理。我们李家庄的青年和社员，就是因为学习了“老三篇”和毛主席的其他文章，振奋了革命精神，才改造了三百亩涝洼地，把粮食产量从亩产三百多斤提高到九百多斤，并且整平了土地，实现了水利化，达到了旱涝保丰收。我们最深刻地体会到毛泽东思想威力最大、威信最高。邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，企图破坏伟大的毛泽东思想在青年心目中的威望，这是蚍蜉撼大树，不自量力。邓拓反对把毛泽东思想传给下一代。我们就是要把毛泽东思想接过来，传下去，世世代代永远放光芒。
    我们学了毛泽东思想，眼亮心明。邓拓想模糊我们的阶级界限，搅乱我们的政治方向，这是痴心妄想。你们这些黑帮是我们的敌人，你们代表那个阶级我们是清清楚楚的。你们宣扬“贫士传”，叫我们给这些坏蛋“一定的地位”；你们还宣扬地主资产阶级的道德，大讲“忠”、“孝”、“赚钱”，叫我们青年向地主资产阶级学习。告诉你们，这绝对办不到。我们不需要学什么“贫士传”，更不需要你们的那种“骨气”，我们有雷锋、王杰、麦贤得这样的共产主义战士作榜样，我们不怕苦，不怕死，决心作一辈子革命派。你们还鼓吹“业余时间是第一兴趣广泛驰骋的自由天地”，引诱青年讲究吃、喝、玩、乐，谈猫说狗，玩古董，打麻将，去注意“美人”、“长发的奇迹”。你们玩弄这一套的阴谋，是企图用资产阶级的生活方式麻醉青年，用“软刀子”割我们的头，用糖衣炮弹轰我们。你们妄想解除我们的思想武装，搞和平演变。我们青年一代有党和毛主席的领导，绝不会落入你们的圈套，上你们的当。我们任何时候也不忘阶级斗争，不管你们打着什么旗号，披着什么外衣，我们统统要戳穿它。
    “三家村”的坏蛋们，在与无产阶级争夺青年的阶级斗争中，还特别注意向知识青年放毒。你们以“教授”、“专家”、“权威”自居，鼓励青年钻古书堆，用“苦读”成为“著名的学者”，你们还假借答复一个老医师的来信，提出什么自学和家传相结合的地主资产阶级治学道路。这也正是当年胡适替吴晗设计的道路，邓拓又来贩卖给今天的知识青年。这是明目张胆地反对毛主席关于知识青年要与工农群众相结合的指示，是明目张胆地阻挠知识青年下乡劳动，反对知识青年参加三大革命运动，企图把知识青年造就成资产阶级接班人，做反党反社会主义的工具。但是广大的知识青年是听毛主席的话的，是要革命的。我们李家庄的青年，按照毛主席的教导，一心一意与贫下中农相结合，为贫下中农服务，走又红又专的道路。他们拿起锄头会种田，拿起枪杆能打仗，在邓拓等向社会主义猖狂进攻的今天，他们又拿起笔杆向牛鬼蛇神开火。李家庄的知识青年是这样，临朐县的知识青年也是这样，全国的知识青年都是这样，你们想在知识青年中为资产阶级捉俘虏是枉费心机的。
