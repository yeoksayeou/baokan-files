    Despise the Bourgeoisie's Technical "Authorities"
    Shanghai "Liberation Daily" May 20 Editorial
    The advanced deeds of Comrade Meng Dehe and others in manufacturing domestically produced seamless oxygen cylinders are a paean to greatly enhance the proletariat's ambition and greatly diminish the bourgeoisie's prestige. It makes the bourgeois technical "authorities" pale in comparison and allows the revolutionary people's ambition and creativity to shine brightly.
    Comrade Meng Dehe and his factory comrades all said: "The birth of domestically produced oxygen cylinders was fought out in the struggle between two ideologies and two lines." This sentence is correct and well said. As everyone knows, natural science and technology itself does not have class character; we must learn all advanced technologies that are useful to us. However, the ideology and path used to develop science and technology, and who science and technology serve, do have class character. On this issue, there are two completely opposed ideologies and lines: one is the bourgeoisie's technical development line, which serves a minority of exploiting classes and the development of capitalism. It is opposed to the broad masses of workers, it can only rely on and buy off a few technical experts to carry out technical work, and it monopolizes technology as private property to pursue more profits; while the broad masses of workers are excluded from the laboratory and fundamentally cannot and will not participate in scientific and technological research. The other is the proletariat's technical development line, which serves the people's interests and the construction of socialism. Therefore, it can rely on the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, fully absorb the practical experience of the broad working masses to the greatest extent, maximize the wisdom and creativity of the masses, break the circle of a few people engaged in technology, and rely on the broad masses to develop science and technology. Our proletariat's technical development line is far superior to the bourgeoisie's technical development line, and the path is much broader. Acting in accordance with the proletariat's technical development line will be lively and vigorous, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results; acting in accordance with the bourgeoisie's technical development line will inevitably be cold and desolate, rigid and inflexible, achieving less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. The struggle between these two technical development lines is a reflection of the class struggle in the field of science and technology. To implement the Party's general line, develop our country's science and technology, and strive to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels in the not-too-distant future, we must adhere to the proletariat's technical line and oppose the bourgeoisie's technical line. The successful manufacture of oxygen cylinders by Comrade Meng Dehe and others is a victory in implementing the proletariat's technical line, a victory in breaking down "foreign frameworks," and a victory in carrying out mass movements in technical work.
    How can we adhere to the proletariat's technical development line? The successful trial manufacture of domestically produced oxygen cylinders provides a very good answer, which is: to promote the revolutionary spirit of daring to speak, daring to think, daring to break through, and daring to create, and to dare to despise all bourgeois technical "authorities." The characteristic of bourgeois technical "authorities" is to act as "authorities," stubbornly clinging to foreign frameworks, looking down on the masses, and even more looking down on the practical experience of the masses, hindering the development of science and technology. You want to develop cutting-edge products? He says, foreigners haven't done it before! You want to create new processes and new technologies? He says, it hasn't been seen in foreign literature! You want to start with indigenous methods? He says, without foreign equipment, it can't be done at all! Some comrades are superstitious about "authorities," and they are frightened by their foreign crutches waving a few times and dare not act. Comrade Meng Dehe and others are not like that. In the process of trial-manufacturing oxygen cylinders, with a commanding momentum, they dared to carry out a tit-for-tat contest with the bourgeois technical "authorities": Some people asserted that "China will need at least another twenty years to manufacture oxygen cylinders," but Comrade Meng Dehe and his comrades, based on the urgent needs of the country's socialist construction, did what they said and manufactured oxygen cylinders in just a few years; some people said, "Welded oxygen cylinders must be forged, which has not been seen in world literature," but Comrade Meng Dehe and his comrades did not care about that and insisted on conducting experiments, and finally mastered the laws of forging from practice and solved this problem; when someone was appraising the oxygen cylinders, they made things difficult in many ways, insisting that the cylinders were "useless," but Comrade Meng Dehe and his comrades drew conclusions based on experiments, proving that the oxygen cylinders were very good in use, breaking the shackles of various frameworks of "experts." In this way, Comrade Meng Dehe and others eliminated the superstition of the bourgeois technical "authorities," relied on the masses, relied on practice, and created a veritable "striving-for-success cylinder." From this, it can be seen that if we do not liberate our minds, do not eliminate superstition, and do not dare to despise the bourgeois technical "authorities," it will be fundamentally impossible to jump out of the old framework and further develop technology.
    Where did Comrade Meng Dehe and others get the strength and confidence to dare to fight the bourgeois "authorities"? It comes from Mao Zedong Thought. The process of manufacturing oxygen cylinders is precisely the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. The successful trial manufacture of domestically produced oxygen cylinders once again reveals a truth to people: to develop our country's science and technology in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, and to catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels as soon as possible, we must act in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, continuously carry out the struggle between two ideologies and two lines in the field of science and technology, adhere to the proletariat's technical development line, and overthrow all "authorities" and "foreign frameworks" that adhere to the bourgeoisie's technical development line!

    藐视资产阶级技术“权威”
    上海《解放日报》五月二十日社论
    孟德和等同志制造国产无缝氧气瓶的先进事迹，是一曲大长无产阶级志气、大灭资产阶级威风的凯歌。它使资产阶级技术“权威”黯然失色，使革命人民的雄心壮志和创造才能大放光彩。
    孟德和和他们厂里的同志都说：“国产氧气瓶的诞生，是在两种思想、两条路线的斗争中斗出来的。”这句话说得对，说得好。大家知道，自然科学技术本身，并没有阶级性，我们要学习一切对我们有用的先进的技术；但是，用什么思想、走什么道路来发展科学技术，科学技术为谁服务，却是有阶级性的。在这个问题上，有两种完全对立的思想和路线：一种是资产阶级的技术发展路线，它是为少数剥削阶级服务、为发展资本主义服务的，它和广大职工是对立的，它只能依靠、收买少数技术专家来开展技术工作，并且把技术作为私有财产垄断起来，以追求更多的利润；而广大群众却被排斥在实验室之外，根本不会也不可能参加科学技术研究。另一种是无产阶级的技术发展路线，它是为人民利益服务、为建设社会主义服务的，因而能够依靠广大职工的积极性，能够最充分地吸收广大劳动群众的实践经验，最大限度地发挥群众的智慧和创造力，能够打破少数人搞技术的圈子，能够依靠广大群众发展科学技术。我们无产阶级的技术发展路线，比资产阶级的技术发展路线要优越得多，路子也要宽广得多。按照无产阶级的技术发展路线办事，就会热气腾腾，生龙活虎，多快好省；按照资产阶级的技术发展路线办事，就必然冷冷清清，死死板板，少慢差费。这两条技术发展路线的斗争，是阶级斗争在科学技术领域中的反映。我们要贯彻执行党的总路线，发展我国的科学技术，争取在不远的将来赶上和超过世界先进水平，就一定要坚持无产阶级的技术路线，反对资产阶级的技术路线。孟德和等同志制造氧气瓶成功，正是贯彻执行无产阶级技术路线的胜利，是打破“洋框框”的胜利，是在技术工作中大搞群众运动的胜利。
    怎样才能坚持无产阶级的技术发展路线呢？国产氧气瓶的试制成功，提供了很好的答案，这就是：发扬敢说敢想敢闯敢创的革命精神，敢于藐视一切资产阶级的技术“权威”。资产阶级技术“权威”的特点，是以“权威”自居，死抱住洋框框不放，看不起群众，更看不起群众的实践经验，阻碍着科学技术的发展。你要搞尖端产品么？他说，外国还没有搞过哩！你要创造新工艺、新技术么？他说，外国文献上没有见过！你要土法上马么？他说，没有洋设备，根本搞不成！有些同志迷信“权威”，经不起他们的洋拐棍挥舞几下，就给吓住了，不敢作为了。孟德和等同志却不然。他们在试制氧气瓶的过程中，以高屋建瓴的气势，敢于同资产阶级技术“权威”进行针锋相对的较量：有的人断言“中国要造氧气瓶至少再过二十年”，孟德和他们却根据国家的社会主义建设的急需，说干就干，短短几年功夫，就制成了氧气瓶；有的人说“焊接的氧气瓶要锻造，这在世界文献里还没有看到过”，孟德和他们却不管那一套，坚持进行试验，终于从实践中掌握了锻造的规律，解决了这道难题；有人在鉴定氧气瓶的时候，多方加以非难，硬说瓶子“不顶用”，孟德和他们却凭试验作出结论，证明氧气瓶在使用中好得很，打破了“专家”的种种框框的束缚。就这样，孟德和等同志破除了对资产阶级技术“权威”的迷信，依靠群众，依靠实践，造出了名副其实的“争气瓶”。由此可见，如果不解放思想，不破除迷信，不敢于藐视资产阶级技术“权威”，要想跳出老框框，进一步发展技术是根本不可能的。
    孟德和等同志敢于同资产阶级“权威”斗，他们的力量和信心是从那里来的？是从毛泽东思想来的。制造氧气瓶的过程，正是活学活用毛主席著作的过程。国产氧气瓶的试制成功，又一次向人们揭示了一个真理：要多快好省地发展我国的科学技术，尽快地赶上和超过世界先进水平，我们就必须按照毛泽东思想办事，在科学技术领域内，不断开展两种思想、两条路线的斗争，坚持无产阶级的技术发展路线，把一切坚持资产阶级技术发展路线的“权威”、“洋框框”统统打倒！
