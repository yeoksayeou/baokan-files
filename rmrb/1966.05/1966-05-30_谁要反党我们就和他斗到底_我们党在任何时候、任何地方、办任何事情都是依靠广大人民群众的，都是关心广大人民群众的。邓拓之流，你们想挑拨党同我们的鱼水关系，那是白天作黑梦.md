    We Will Fight Anyone Who Opposes the Party to the End
    Our Party, at any time, in any place, and in doing anything, relies on the broad masses of the people and cares for the broad masses of the people. Deng Tuo and his ilk, you want to sow discord between the Party and our relationship like fish and water, that's daydreaming in broad daylight!
    Liu Tongren, Representative of the National People's Congress, Salesperson of Zhongshan Road Department Store, Changsha City, Hunan

    Recently, I have been reading in the newspapers about the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo and his ilk, and I feel extremely indignant. Deng Tuo and this gang of blackguards, using their positions of power, through newspapers and periodicals such as *Qianxian* ("Frontline"), *Beijing Daily*, and *Beijing Evening News*, viciously attacked our great Party and Chairman Mao, attacked our socialist system and the proletarian dictatorship, attacked the Party's General Line, slandered the Great Leap Forward, and vainly attempted to restore capitalism. We, the broad masses of the working people, resolutely do not agree! We must drag out this gang of bad elements, discredit them completely, and never stop fighting until we have won a complete victory.
    Deng Tuo and his ilk sow discord between the Party and the masses, using extremely malicious language to attack our Party for being "self-righteous and looking down on the masses." This is utter nonsense. Who believes in the masses the most? It is the Party and Chairman Mao. Who respects our working people the most? It is the Party and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao long ago said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "What is the real wall of iron? It is the masses, the millions upon millions who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution." Our Party, at any time, in any place, and in doing anything, relies on the broad masses of the people. I want to shout loudly: Deng Tuo, you are not allowed to talk nonsense!
    I am a salesperson. After liberation, I joined the socialist commercial work. Taking our store as an example, the varieties of goods we handle are about ten thousand, and the amount of money coming in and out every day is several tens of thousands of yuan. The Party and Chairman Mao entrusted such a large business to us to manage. A workers' representative assembly has been established in the store, and each sales team has also established a workers' representative group. Every major decision must be discussed and approved by the workers' representative assembly and the workers' representative group. The worker masses regularly inspect various tasks in the enterprise. Isn't this trusting the masses?
    Furthermore, personally speaking, after liberation, I have always received the care and trust of the Party. In the old society, capitalists broke my hand and injured my waist, but it was the Party that healed me; in the old society, my livelihood was precarious, and life was not guaranteed, but it was the Party that gave me the right to work. The Party trusts our working class the most. Since 1956, I, an ordinary salesperson, have been elected as a representative of the people of Changsha City, and in 1964, I was also elected as a representative of the National People's Congress to personally participate in the management of national affairs. I remember when I attended the first session of the Third National People's Congress in 1964, Premier Zhou's government work report was first printed and distributed to each of us representatives for repeated comments. Party and state leaders also held discussions with us to discuss national affairs. If this isn't the Party believing in and relying on the masses, then what is? In the old society, where would we, the "counter clerks" who were exploited and looked down upon, have the right to speak? I remember before liberation, when a farmer came to the store to buy galoshes, the capitalist insisted on passing off inferior goods as good goods. When I said, "It's not good to do this," I was beaten badly by the capitalist. At that time, the enterprise was a tool for capitalists to exploit and oppress the people. How could we talk about letting workers manage the enterprise and national affairs!
    Deng Tuo, I want to ask you, on what basis do you say that the Party is "self-righteous" and "looks down on the masses"? Does it mean that our Party should believe in and rely on you and your gang, believe in and rely on the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have been overthrown? That is never possible! If we believe in you and rely on you, our country will change color, and we workers, peasants, and the broad masses of working people will return to the days of suffering in the past. No way! Absolutely not! Our Party and the people have a relationship like fish and water. Deng Tuo, if you want to destroy this relationship between the Party and the masses, that is daydreaming in broad daylight. I want to warn you: Whoever opposes our Party, we will resolutely fight them to the end!

    谁要反党我们就和他斗到底
    我们党在任何时候、任何地方、办任何事情都是依靠广大人民群众的，都是关心广大人民群众的。邓拓之流，你们想挑拨党同我们的鱼水关系，那是白天作黑梦
    全国人民代表大会代表湖南长沙市中山路百货商店营业员  柳同仁
    最近以来，我看到报纸上揭发的邓拓之流反党反社会主义罪行，感到非常气愤。邓拓这伙黑帮利用自己的职权，通过《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》等报刊，恶毒地攻击我们伟大的党和毛主席，攻击我们社会主义制度和无产阶级专政，攻击党的总路线，诬蔑大跃进，妄想复辟资本主义。我们广大劳动人民坚决不答应！我们一定要把这伙坏东西揪出来，搞垮搞臭，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    邓拓之流挑拨党和群众的关系，用极其恶毒的语言，攻击我们党“自作聪明，看不起群众”。这完全是一派胡言。谁最相信群众？是党和毛主席。谁最看得起我们劳动人民？是党和毛主席。毛主席早就说过：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”我们党在任何时候、任何地方、办任何事情都是依靠广大人民群众的。我要大喝一声：邓拓，不准你胡说八道！
    我是个营业员。解放后我就参加了社会主义商业工作。拿我们商店来说，经营的品种有一万种左右，每天进出的金额就有几万元。党和毛主席把这样大的家当交给我们管。店里建立了职工代表大会，各营业组也分别成立了职工代表小组，每一次重大的决定都要经过职工代表大会和职工代表小组讨论通过。职工群众经常检查企业里的各项工作。这难道不是相信群众吗？
    再拿我个人来说，解放后，就一直受到党的关怀和信任。旧社会资本家打断了我的手，踢伤了我的腰，是党给我治好的；旧社会使我饭碗挂在腰上跑，生活无保障，是党给了我工作的权利。党最信任我们工人阶级。从一九五六年以来，我一个普普通通的营业员，就一直被选为长沙市人民代表，一九六四年还被选为全国人民代表大会的代表，亲身参加管理国家大事。记得一九六四年参加第三届全国人民代表大会第一次会议时，周总理的政府工作报告，就是先印出来发给我们每个代表反复征求意见的。党和国家领导人还和我们一起座谈，商议国家大事。这不是党相信和依靠群众，又是什么？要是在旧社会，我们这些受尽压榨、被人瞧不起的“抹柜台的”，哪有说话的权利？记得解放前，一个农民到店里买套鞋，资本家硬要以次货充好货，我说，“这样做不好”，就挨了资本家一顿毒打。那时，企业是资本家压榨和剥削人民的工具，哪里还谈得到让职工管理企业和国家大事呢！
    邓拓，我要问你，你凭什么说党“自作聪明”，“看不起群众”？难道要我们的党相信和依靠你们这伙人，相信和依靠打倒了的地富反坏右分子？那是永远办不到的！相信了你们，依靠了你们，我们的国家就要变颜色，我们工人、农民、广大劳动群众就要回到过去受苦受难的日子里去。不行！绝对不行！我们党和人民群众有着鱼水之情。邓拓，你想破坏党和群众的这种关系，那是白日里作黑梦。我要警告你：谁要反对我们的党，我们就要和他坚决斗争到底！
