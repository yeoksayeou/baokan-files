    Miscalculated on the Abacus
    U.S. Senator Morse said that, according to the predictions of American military experts, the United States would need three million troops to expand the war to China. He lamented, "Where will we get enough money and soldiers to support a large-scale ground war across several continents?"
    It seems that this senator is relatively realistic. However, the estimate he cited is somewhat too optimistic. Based on the current situation in the South Vietnamese battlefield, the United States has dispatched more than 200,000 invading troops but still cannot cope with the fourteen million people of South Vietnam. To deal with seven hundred million Chinese people, how many American troops would be needed? This is a very simple arithmetic problem. The answer is at least ten million, not three million. Therefore, Morse's lament is even more well-founded.

    算盘没打对
    美国参议员莫尔斯说，据美国的军事专家预测，美国要把战争扩大到中国，非用三百万军队不可。他感叹道：“我们从哪里去弄足够的钱和军人来支持相隔几个大洲的一场大规模地面战争？”
    看来，这位参议员是比较有现实感的。不过他所援引的估计未免太乐观了。按目前南越战场的情况来看，美国出动了二十多万侵略军队仍然对付不了一千四百万南越人民。要想对付七亿中国人民需要多少美国军队，这是一道很简单的算术题。得数至少是一千万而不是三百万。因此，莫尔斯的感叹就更有根据了。
