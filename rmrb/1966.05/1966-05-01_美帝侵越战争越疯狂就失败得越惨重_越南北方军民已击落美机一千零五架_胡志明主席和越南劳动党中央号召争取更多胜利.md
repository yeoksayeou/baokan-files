    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th -- President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party sent letters to the people, cadres, and soldiers throughout Vietnam on the 30th, warmly congratulating the brilliant victory of the military and civilians in North Vietnam in shooting down more than a thousand American bandit aircraft.
    Chairman Ho's letter stated: "While celebrating the 12th anniversary of the historically significant Dien Bien Phu victory, the military and civilians of our North Vietnam achieved a glorious feat on April 29, 1966, shooting down the 1,000th American aircraft. At the same time, the military and civilians in the South have achieved many great victories. Thus, the more frantically US imperialism wages its war of aggression against Vietnam, the more miserable defeats it suffers in both the North and the South of our country."
    The letter said, "I am very pleased to express, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the government, commendation to the soldiers, cadres, and people of all ethnic groups for uniting as one, overcoming all difficulties, fighting well, and producing well."
    The letter said, "The more disastrous the defeats suffered by the American bandits, the more cunning and ferocious they become. Our compatriots, cadres, and soldiers must not be complacent and underestimate the enemy because of victory. We must constantly heighten our vigilance, enhance our fighting will, and carry forward the heroic tradition of Dien Bien Phu. We must strive for more victories. We are determined to defeat the American aggressor bandits, defend the North, and wholeheartedly support the Southern liberation revolution, so that the great cause of resisting America and saving the nation will achieve a complete victory."
    The congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party pointed out, "The American bandits have already suffered disastrous defeats in both the North and South of our country. But they will still have many insidious and cunning plots. You must constantly heighten your vigilance, carry forward revolutionary heroism, strengthen organizational sense and discipline, as well as the spirit of building the army through diligence and thrift, strengthen internal unity, the unity between the army and the people, and together with the entire people, smash all the enemy's sinister plots and means, firmly defend the socialist North, and wholeheartedly support the Southern liberation revolution, thereby peacefully unifying the motherland."
    On the 29th, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army sent a telegram to the people's armed forces of Bac Thai Province in North Vietnam, commending them for their meritorious service in shooting down the 1,000th American bandit aircraft.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th -- The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army held a press conference in Hanoi on the morning of the 30th, announcing that the American bandit aircraft shot down by the military and civilians in North Vietnam had exceeded one thousand.
    Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, read out at the meeting the communique issued by the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army on the great victory of shooting down more than a thousand American aircraft.
    The communique pointed out that the US imperialist destructive war against North Vietnam has been defeated.
    The communique said that the American bandits sent out their air force to attack North Vietnam, vainly attempting to threaten the military and civilians in both North and South Vietnam, shake our determination to resist America and save the nation, sabotage socialist construction in the North, and obstruct the North Vietnamese people's active support for the South Vietnamese people. However, the facts are precisely the opposite of its wishes. The more the military and civilians in both North and South Vietnam fight, the more victories they achieve, and the stronger they become. The determination to resist America and save the nation has become even higher.
    The communique said that the American bandits sent out their air force to launch attacks on the North, hoping to achieve its strategic goals. However, the so-called "air superiority" of the United States has been shattered. The important air force strength of the American bandits has suffered serious losses.
    The communique said that the American bandits sent out their air force to launch attacks on the North, attempting to salvage the crisis of defeat facing it and its running dogs. However, the facts are precisely the opposite of its arrogant wishes. Despite massively sending over 270,000 American expeditionary troops and their accomplice troops to the South, the American bandits are still unable to reverse the situation. US imperialism has also suffered a heavy defeat politically and has fallen into unprecedented isolation in the world.
    The communique pointed out that the great victories achieved by the military and civilians in North and South Vietnam show that the Vietnamese people have sufficient strength to defeat any type of war of aggression waged by US imperialism under any circumstances.
    The communique sternly warned the American aggressors that every new "escalation" in the war will inevitably be defeated. All the evil actions they carry out against the people of both North and South Vietnam will inevitably be punished.
    The communique called on the Vietnamese military and civilians to hold high Chairman Ho Chi Minh's brilliant banner of "determination to defeat the American aggressor bandits," heighten vigilance, deepen hatred for the enemy, advance courageously, and resolutely lead the cause of resisting America and saving the nation to a complete victory.
    Colonel Ha Van Lau also answered questions raised by reporters at the meeting. At the press conference, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army also announced the confessions of seven captured American pilots.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th -- It was announced here on the 29th that from August 5, 1964, to April 29 this year, North Vietnam had shot down 1,005 invading American aircraft.
    On the 29th, the North Vietnamese air defense forces and people, in coordination with the Vietnamese People's Air Force, shot down seven American aircraft. Two were shot down in Bac Thai Province, three in Quang Ninh Province, one in Ha Bac Province, and another was shot down by the People's Air Force.
    The 1,000th American aircraft was shot down over Bac Thai Province.

    美帝侵越战争越疯狂就失败得越惨重
    越南北方军民已击落美机一千零五架
    胡志明主席和越南劳动党中央号召争取更多胜利
    据新华社河内三十日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明和越南劳动党中央委员会三十日分别写信给越南全国人民、干部和战士，热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落美国强盗飞机一千多架的辉煌胜利。
    胡主席的信中说：“在庆祝具有历史意义的奠边府大捷十二周年的时候，我国北方军民于一九六六年四月二十九日建立了辉煌战功，击落第一千架美国飞机。同时，南方军民取得了许多大捷。这样，美帝国主义越是疯狂进行侵略越南的战争，它就越是在我国南北两方遭到惨重失败。”
    信中说，“我很高兴代表党中央和政府表扬战士、干部和各族同胞团结一致，克服一切困难，战斗好，生产好。”
    信中说，“美国强盗遭到更加惨重的失败，它就更加狡猾和凶恶。我国同胞、干部和战士决不能因胜利而主观轻敌。必须时刻提高警惕，提高战斗意志；必须发扬奠边府的英雄传统。必须努力争取更多的胜利。决心战胜美国侵略强盗，保卫北方，全心全力支援南方解放革命，使伟大的抗美救国事业取得彻底胜利。”
    越南劳动党中央的贺信指出，“美国强盗已经在我国南北两方遭到了惨败。但是它们还会有许多阴险和狡猾的阴谋。你们必须时刻提高警惕，发扬革命英雄主义、加强组织观念和纪律性以及勤俭建军精神，加强内部团结，军民团结，同全民一起粉碎敌人的一切凶恶阴谋和手段，牢固地保卫社会主义北方，全心全力支援南方解放革命，进而和平统一祖国”。
    越南人民军总司令部在二十九日曾经打电报给越南北方北太省各人民武装力量，表彰他们击落第一千架美国强盗飞机的功勋。
    新华社河内三十日电　越南人民军总司令部三十日上午在河内举行记者招待会，宣布越南北方军民击落的美国强盗飞机已经超过一千架。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校在会上宣读了越南人民军总司令部就击落美国飞机一千多架的巨大胜利发表的公报。
    公报指出，美帝国主义对越南北方进行的破坏性战争已经遭到失败。
    公报说，美国强盗出动空军进攻越南北方，妄图对越南南北两方军民进行威胁，动摇我们的抗美救国的决心，破坏北方的社会主义建设，阻挠北方人民对南方人民的积极支援。然而事实和它的愿望恰恰相反，我国南北两方军民越打越胜，越胜越强，抗美救国的决心更加高涨。
    公报说，美国强盗出动空军向北方发动袭击，指望实现它的战略目的。但是，美国的所谓“空中优势”遭到了粉碎。美国强盗重要的空军力量遭到严重损失。
    公报说，美国强盗出动空军向北方发动进攻，企图挽救它和它的走狗面临的失败危机。但是，事实跟它的狂妄的愿望恰恰相反。尽管它大规模地把二十七万多美国远征军及其帮凶军派到南方，美国强盗仍然无法扭转局势。美帝国主义还在政治上遭到沉重的失败，在世界上陷于空前孤立。
    公报指出，越南北方和南方军民所取得的巨大胜利表明，越南人民有足够的力量打败美帝国主义在任何情况下进行的任何类型的侵略战争。
    公报严厉警告美国侵略者，它们在战争中的每一个新的“升级”，都必将被打败。他们对越南南北两方人民所进行的一切罪恶行动，都必将受到惩罚。
    公报号召越南军民高举胡志明主席的“决心战胜美国侵略强盗”的光辉旗帜，提高警惕，加深对敌人的仇恨，英勇前进，坚决把抗美救国事业引向彻底胜利。
    何文楼大校在会上还回答了记者们提出的问题。在记者招待会上，越南人民军总司令部还公布了被俘的七名美国飞行员的供词。
    新华社河内二十九日电　据这里二十九日宣布，从一九六四年八月五日到今年四月二十九日，越南北方已经击落入侵的美国飞机一千零五架。
    二十九日，越南北方防空部队和人民在越南人民空军的配合下，击落美机七架。计在北太省击落两架，广宁省击落三架，河北省击落一架，另一架由人民空军击落。
    第一千架美机是在北太省上空被击落的。
