    According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 6th May. The French government announced on the 6th that France would not participate in the annual naval exercises of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, beginning on May 19th. The French government had just announced on the 5th that, from June 1st, France would prohibit U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization military aircraft from flying over French airspace. Last year, due to disapproval of the U.S. policy in Vietnam and unwillingness to be implicated by the U.S., France boycotted the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting, refused to participate in the naval exercise, and withdrew French officers from the organization. This French action brought the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to the brink of paralysis.

    法国拒绝参加东南亚集团海军演习
    据新华社巴黎六日电　法国政府六日宣布，法国将不参加东南亚条约组织五月十九日开始的一年一度的海军演习。法国政府刚刚在五日宣布，从六月一日起，法国将禁止美国和北大西洋集团的军用飞机飞越法国领空。去年，由于不赞成美国在越南的政策和不愿意受美国牵连，法国抵制了东南亚条约组织会议，拒绝参加海军演习，并且从这个组织中撤退了法国军官。法国的这个作法使得侵略性的东南亚条约组织濒于瘫痪。
