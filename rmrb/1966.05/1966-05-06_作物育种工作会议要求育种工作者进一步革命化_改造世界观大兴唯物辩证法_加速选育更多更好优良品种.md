    Xinhua News Agency: The Third National Crop Breeding Work Conference proposed that breeding workers should vigorously promote materialist dialectics, take various effective measures, and forge a path of their own that adapts to the speed of China's construction, in order to rapidly select more and better superior varieties for agricultural production increase.
    The breeding work conference held in Beijing was a conference that highlighted politics. The participating representatives, including agricultural scientists and some farmer breeders, earnestly studied Chairman Mao's works at the meeting and, in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, jointly examined and summarized the achievements and shortcomings of breeding work since liberation.
    After discussion, the conference proposed that the guiding principles and tasks for future breeding work are: to highlight politics, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, base on mass selection and mass breeding, combine professional teams with mass movements, implement overall planning, zonal selection and breeding, complete sets of matching measures, continuous updating, and do everything possible to select more and better improved varieties for the forefront of production.
    During the conference, representatives from various regions exchanged experiences in breeding work and recommended seventy-two new superior varieties of grain crops and economic crops that had been selected.
    Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, agricultural scientists and farmer breeders throughout the country have selected some new varieties with significant yield increases, strong resistance to adversity, and adaptation to certain cultivation systems, which have played a certain role in promoting agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,300 superior varieties have been selected for the five major grain crops alone: rice, wheat, corn, millet, and sorghum. It is particularly worth mentioning that a group of dwarf rice varieties developed in the south has solved the problem of easy lodging of rice in the later stages, which has played a greater role in increasing rice production. Now, these dwarf rice varieties have been widely promoted in the southern provinces. Some rust-resistant and yield-increasing wheat varieties and some high-yielding cotton varieties with good quality that have been selected in wheat and cotton aspects are also being promoted. Due to the extensive development of mass scientific experimentation activities in the people's communes, many of these superior varieties were selected by farmer breeders or the masses. In recent years, emphasis has been placed on scientific workers going deep into reality, emphasizing the combination of breeding professional teams and the broad masses, and breeding networks with points and faces are being formed in various regions, and a large number of advanced breeding units, advanced breeding workers, and outstanding farmer breeders have emerged. The level of breeding work has also been greatly improved, and the time for developing many new varieties has been greatly shortened.
    The meeting held that further revolutionizing the breeding workforce is the only way to make greater achievements and adapt to the requirements of China's rapidly developing agricultural production for high-yielding varieties. At present, China's agricultural production conditions have changed greatly, and yields have increased rapidly, and many crop varieties cannot adapt, and new varieties are urgently needed. However, many scientific personnel engaged in breeding work do not have enough contact with reality and the masses, and old frameworks and foreign frameworks still restrict the further development of breeding work. To revolutionize the breeding team, it is necessary to highlight politics, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. On the one hand, transform the worldview, establish a complete and thorough idea of serving the people, and clarify the question of breeding for whom; on the other hand, vigorously promote materialist dialectics in breeding work, vigorously break metaphysics and cumbersome philosophy, break old frameworks and foreign frameworks, summarize the advanced breeding experience of the masses, and further improve the level of breeding work.

    作物育种工作会议要求育种工作者进一步革命化
    改造世界观大兴唯物辩证法  加速选育更多更好优良品种
    新华社讯　第三次全国作物育种工作会议提出：育种工作者要大兴唯物辩证法，采取各种有效措施，闯出一条适应我国建设速度的自己的道路，为农业增产迅速选育出更多更好的优良品种。
    在北京举行的这一次育种工作会议，是一次突出政治的会议。出席的代表包括农业科学工作者和一些农民育种家，在会上认真地学习了毛主席的著作，按毛主席指示的精神，共同检查和总结了解放以来育种工作的成就和缺点。
    经过讨论，会议提出今后育种工作的方针和任务是：突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以群选群育为基础，专业队伍与群众运动相结合，实行全面规划、分区选育、成龙配套、不断更新，千方百计地为生产第一线选育更多更好的良种。
    会议期间，各地代表交流了育种工作的经验，推荐了七十二个新选育成的粮食作物和经济作物的优良品种。
    解放以来，在党的领导下，全国农业科学工作者和农民育种家，都选育出了一些增产显著、抗逆性强、适应一定栽培制度的新的品种，对农业增产起了一定的促进作用。据不完全统计，仅水稻、小麦、玉米、谷子、高粱五种主要粮食作物，就选育出了一千三百多个优良品种。特别值得一提的是南方育成的一批矮秆水稻良种，解决了水稻后期易倒伏的难题，对水稻增产起的作用较大。现在，这些矮秆水稻良种已经在南方各省大面积推广。小麦方面选育的一些抗锈增产品种，棉花方面选育的一些质量好的高产品种也正在推广。由于人民公社广泛开展群众性的科学实验活动，其中许多优良品种是农民育种家或群众选育的。近年来，强调科学工作者深入实际，强调育种专业队伍与广大群众结合，各地正在形成有点有面的育种网，涌现出了一大批先进育种单位、先进育种工作者和优秀的农民育种家。育种工作水平也有很大提高，许多新品种育成时间大大缩短。
    会议认为：育种工作队伍的进一步革命化，才能作出更大成绩，适应我国迅速发展的农业生产对于高产品种的要求。现在我国农业生产条件变化很大，产量提高很快，许多作物品种不能适应，迫切需要新的品种。但是目前许多搞育种工作的科学人员，联系实际、联系群众还不够，旧框框和洋框框仍然限制着育种工作的进一步开展。育种队伍革命化，就必须突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装起来，一方面，改造世界观，树立完全的、彻底的为人民服务的思想，弄清楚为谁育种的问题；另一方面，要在育种工作中大兴唯物辩证法，大破形而上学和烦琐哲学，打破旧框框和洋框框，总结群众中先进的育种经验，进一步提高育种工作的水平。
