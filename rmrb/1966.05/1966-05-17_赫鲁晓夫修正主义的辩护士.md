    At a conference, Deng Tuo tried his best to beautify the Khrushchev revisionists and defended their views. He said that it could not be said that Khrushchev "did not understand" Marxism-Leninism at all; he slandered our party's criticism of revisionism's "peaceful transition" as not proceeding from reality; he also confused the boundary between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, attempting to restore capitalism in China.
    Apologists for Khrushchev Revisionism
    Jia Guan, Li Runhai, Xu Baogeng, Zhao Yuanbi, Xu Keqing, Political Course Teachers, Tsinghua University
    On August 22, 1963, shortly after the publication of the CCP Central Committee’s programmatic document "Proposal Concerning the General Line of the International Communist Movement," Deng Tuo delivered a so-called report on the "anti-revisionism" issue at the Municipal Party School to some political work cadres and political course teachers from universities and middle schools in Beijing. In this report, Deng Tuo tried his best to beautify Khrushchev revisionists and defend their views; viciously attacked our party’s Marxist views on the issue of proletarian revolution; and distorted the nature of this great debate in every possible way. This was another poisonous arrow that Deng Tuo released from the podium against the Party and socialism.
      Deng Tuo described
  Khrushchev, the greatest
  proletarian traitor of our time,
  as a fighter who made mistakes but could turn back,
  a fighter who was “infinitely loyal to revolution and socialism.”
    When Deng Tuo gave his report, the CPSU Central Committee had already issued its notorious open letter to party organizations at all levels and all Communist Party members. The Khrushchev revisionists had long demonstrated their final break with the international communist movement through a series of acts of betrayal, showing that they had degenerated into running dogs of US imperialism and incurable proletarian traitors. Deng Tuo attempted to overturn this historical conclusion and reverse the verdict on the greatest proletarian traitor of our time. In his report, he said that it cannot be said that Khrushchev "understands nothing" about Marxism-Leninism, it should be said that he "understands it but not well". Because Khrushchev's "worldview was not resolved," it was not surprising that "he made mistakes at a historical turning point." To prove this point, Deng Tuo painstakingly found an example from Russian revolutionary history and found a short article entitled "In Memory of Comrade Proshyan" in Lenin's works (Volume 36, page 520 of the Complete Works of Lenin), introducing Proshyan in detail and comparing him to Khrushchev, and repeatedly emphasized that everyone should go back and open this article to study it carefully. We should really thank Deng Tuo for providing us with a good weapon of criticism. As long as people read Lenin's article, Deng Tuo's conspiracy to overturn the verdict for the traitor will be revealed.
    First of all, Lenin pointed out in this article: "Proshyan showed from the beginning an infinite loyalty to the revolution and socialism" and was a "socialist with firm beliefs" among the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. Deng Tuo compared Khrushchev to Proshyan, which was to tell everyone: Khrushchev was also a person who was "infinitely loyal to the revolution and socialism," a "socialist with firm beliefs." When evaluating Khrushchev, people must not forget his "glorious history," otherwise they would violate Lenin's "spirit."
    Secondly, Lenin wrote: During the Brest peace talks, Proshyan "due to committing the subjectivism of the Narodniks,...allowed a strange force of illusion, namely German imperialism, to turn his head," and therefore "embarked on the road of armed struggle against the Soviet regime." Deng Tuo compared Khrushchev to Proshyan, which was to tell everyone: Khrushchev made mistakes because he was also confused by some kind of subjectivism. Shouldn't this kind of mistake be forgiven?
    Thirdly, Lenin argued: Despite this, Proshyan’s “contribution to the consolidation of Soviet power” was still greater than his “crime of undermining this power.” Deng Tuo's comparison of Khrushchev to Proshyan was an attempt to apply Lenin's conclusion of "merit is greater than demerit" to Khrushchev. Wasn't this openly standing on Khrushchev's position and attacking our party and other Marxist-Leninist fraternal parties' criticisms of Khrushchev revisionism as all being wrong?
    Finally, Lenin predicted in the article: If Proshyan had not died prematurely, he "would definitely return to communism—more firmly than before." Deng Tuo compared Khrushchev to Proshyan, which was to predict to people: Khrushchev would also abandon his mistakes and return to Marxism-Leninism, and more firmly than before, as long as God blesses him not to die prematurely. Deng Tuo was actually advising people: Stop your anti-revisionist struggle, he will change his mind, sooner or later you will shake hands and make peace!
    Please see, Deng Tuo only cited one example, but isn't this more useful than saying a thousand or ten thousand words to beautify Khrushchev? Deng Tuo only used one example, but wasn't the entire content of his attempt to reverse the verdict for Khrushchev revealed? Even more insidious is that Deng Tuo used the method of distorting Lenin's works to reverse the verdict for Khrushchev, thinking that others would not be able to accuse him. However, Lenin's works are the theoretical weapon of the proletarian revolution, and the revisionists' attempt to turn it into a tool to serve themselves is futile. Lenin's works not only did not help Deng Tuo, but instead, like a sharp dagger, pierced through Deng Tuo's political conspiracy. This is called things going in the opposite direction. Deng Tuo lifted a rock and hit his own foot, really stupid and sad!
    In his report, Deng Tuo not only beautified Khrushchev, but also defended Khrushchev’s comrades-in-arms Togliatti and Thorez. He said that they "served as general secretaries for many years" and "are old veterans in the international communist movement," so the mistakes they made were only because they "lack Marxist-Leninist cultivation" and "see problems mechanically," using "formal logic." Isn't this openly opposing the fundamental points in our party's anti-revisionist articles such as "Another Discussion on the Differences Between Comrade Togliatti and Us"?
    Deng Tuo's conspiracy to reverse the verdict for Khrushchev revisionists will never succeed. Historically, everyone who defended traitors has suffered the same fate as traitors. This is the law of class struggle. Can a small Deng Tuo escape the control of this law and become an exception?
      Deng Tuo attacked our party's adherence
  to the theory of violent proletarian revolution,
  saying it was "captive to metaphysical one-
  sidedness."
    In his report, Deng Tuo frantically attacked the theory of violent proletarian revolution and openly advocated the revisionist "peaceful transition." He played with philosophical concepts and said that only by combining peaceful transition with non-peaceful transition can there be "unity of opposites, and only then can we see the problem dialectically and comprehensively." Deng Tuo also distortedly quoted Engels' words to slander our single mention of the possibility of seizing power by armed force as "one-sidedly grasping one point, treating it as absolute, and opposing it to another point," and slandered our party's criticism of the revisionist "peaceful transition" as not proceeding from reality and being "captive to the one-sidedness of metaphysical thinking"!
    Chairman Mao's summary of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and a universal law of proletarian revolution in all countries. After our party had already refuted the modern revisionist fallacy of "peaceful transition" beyond recognition, Deng Tuo still stubbornly promoted "peaceful transition," which shows that Deng Tuo has completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism and become a jackal with Khrushchev revisionism! Deng Tuo watched with his own eyes that the revisionist theory of "peaceful transition" has brought heavy losses to the revolutions of many countries, but he still desperately trumpets the possibility of "peaceful transition," which shows that Deng Tuo deliberately ruined the revolutions of various countries and acted as a pastor of imperialism.
    It is worth noting that just one month before Deng Tuo's report, precisely when the Soviet Communist leadership issued the open letter, in the "open letter," the Soviet Communist leadership reiterated the old tune of "peaceful transition," and Deng Tuo's remarks were exactly the same! It seems that Deng Tuo acted entirely according to Khrushchev's will and can be called a loyal mouthpiece of Khrushchev!
      Deng Tuo described the anti-revisionist
  struggle as a purely philosophical dispute,
  plotting to disintegrate and sabotage the anti-
  revisionist struggle.
    In his report, Deng Tuo tried his best to deny that the differences between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism are fundamental line differences. He said: "Regarding the contradiction with imperialism,...they also admit this contradiction, but they just want to use the method of compromise and concession to resolve the contradiction." That is to say, the contradiction between us and revisionism is not a question of anti-imperialism or not, but only a difference in method.
    When talking about the reasons for the differences, he attributed them all to the fact that "we dialectically and comprehensively view the problem, while they view the problem in isolation, one-sidedly, and metaphysically." In this way, Deng Tuo actually degraded the serious struggle against modern revisionism, which is related to the fate of mankind, into a purely philosophical dispute!
    Is the difference between us and the modern revisionists only "different tactics" and "different understandings"? No, stop lying! You know very well that the difference between us and you, the revisionists, is, in the final analysis, the fundamental difference of whether or not to have a revolution, whether or not to oppose imperialism, and whether or not to have Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Why don't you dare to admit it? You are afraid! Lenin said it well: For revisionists, "the most unpleasant, the most unwilling, and the most unacceptable thing is to clarify the main differences of opinion in theory, program, strategy, and organization." Doesn't this passage just hit your vital point?
    Deng Tuo said this with ulterior motives. That is to: confuse the boundary between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, let the revolutionary people abandon the struggle against revisionism, let revisionist ideology run rampant, and let capitalism be restored in China! Therefore, Deng Tuo tried his best to conceal the seriousness and sharpness of this struggle. The fact that he did this is itself a serious and sharp class struggle! Deng Tuo! The eyes of the revolutionaries cannot be blurred, the anti-revisionist struggle cannot be hindered, and your doomed fate cannot be changed!
    Through the above analysis, it is not difficult for readers to see that Deng Tuo claimed that his report was to explain our party's "Proposal Concerning the General Line of the International Communist Movement," but in fact, what he vigorously promoted was the Soviet Communist Central Committee's "Open Letter." As far as we know, the Soviet Communist revisionist leading group once hired a group of so-called "propagandists" to go to various parts of the Soviet Union to promote the anti-China views of the "Open Letter." It seems that it would be appropriate to give Deng Tuo the title of "propaganda and agitation member" of the Soviet Communist leading group!
    Since Deng Tuo made the report in the capacity of Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat under the banner of interpreting the central documents, and the audience was propaganda work cadres, the impact was extremely bad. This debt must be thoroughly settled, and the revisionist apologists like Deng Tuo, and all the demons and monsters in the world, must be overthrown!

    邓拓在一次会议上，极力美化赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，并为其观点辩护。他说，不能说赫鲁晓夫对马克思列宁主义“一点不懂”；他污蔑我们党批判修正主义的“和平过渡”，是不从实际出发；他还混淆马克思列宁主义与修正主义的界限，企图让资本主义在中国复辟。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义的辩护士
    清华大学政治课教师　贾观　李润海　徐葆耕　赵原璧　许克清
    一九六三年八月二十二日，在中共中央《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》这个纲领性文件刚刚发表不久，邓拓在市委党校向北京市大中学校的部分政治工作干部和政治课教师做了一个所谓“反修”问题的报告。在这个报告里，邓拓极力美化赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，并为其观点辩护；恶毒攻击我党在无产阶级革命问题上的马克思主义的观点；百般歪曲这场大论战的性质。这是邓拓在讲坛上放出的又一支反党反社会主义的毒箭。
      邓拓把当代最大的
  无产阶级叛徒赫鲁晓夫
  说成是犯了错误可以回
  头的“对革命和社会主
  义无限忠诚”的战士
    邓拓做报告时，苏共中央已经发表了那封臭名远扬的给各级党组织和全体共产党员的公开信，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者早已用自己的一系列背叛行为表明了他们同国际共产主义运动的最终决裂，表明他们堕落成了美帝国主义的走狗、不可救药的无产阶级叛徒。邓拓妄图推翻这个历史的结论，为当代最大的无产阶级叛徒翻案。他在报告中说，不能说赫鲁晓夫对马列主义“一点不懂”，应当说“似懂非懂”。由于赫鲁晓夫“世界观没有解决”，所以“他在历史转折的关头犯了错误”，这是不奇怪的。为了论证这一点，邓拓煞费心机地从俄国革命史上找了一个例，从列宁著作中翻到了一篇题为《悼念普罗相同志》的短文（《列宁全集》第三十六卷第五百二十页），不厌其详地向大家介绍普罗相其人，用他来比喻赫鲁晓夫，并反复强调要大家回去翻开这篇文章好好地学一学。我们真应该感谢邓拓，他为我们提供了一个很好的批评的武器。只要人们读一读列宁这篇文章，邓拓为叛徒翻案的阴谋就真相大白了。
    首先，列宁在这篇文章里指出：“普罗相一开始就表现出对革命和社会主义的无限忠诚”，是左派社会革命党人中的一个“信念坚定的社会主义者”。邓拓把赫鲁晓夫比成普罗相，就是告诉大家：赫鲁晓夫也曾是一个“对革命和社会主义无限忠诚”的人、“信念坚定的社会主义者”，人们在评价赫鲁晓夫时，万万不要忘记他的“光荣历史”，否则就会违背列宁的“精神”。
    其次，列宁写道：在布列斯特和谈时期，普罗相“由于犯了民粹派的主观主义，……让一种幻想的怪异力量即德国帝国主义把自己弄得晕头转向”，因而“走上了同苏维埃政权作武装斗争的道路”。邓拓把赫鲁晓夫比成普罗相，就是告诉大家：赫鲁晓夫犯错误，也是由于犯了某种主观主义而弄得自己“晕头转向”，这种错误不是应该原谅吗？
    再次，列宁论道：尽管这样，普罗相“为巩固苏维埃政权作出的贡献”仍大于他“破坏这一政权的罪过”。邓拓把赫鲁晓夫比成普罗相，是企图把列宁对普罗相所作的“功大于过”的结论套在赫鲁晓夫的头上。这不是公然地站到赫鲁晓夫的立场上，攻击我党和其它马列主义兄弟党对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的批判都是错误的吗？
    最后，列宁在文章中预言：如果普罗相不是过早地逝世、他“一定会同共产主义重新——比以前更巩固地——接近起来”。邓拓把赫鲁晓夫比成普罗相，就是向人们预示：赫鲁晓夫也一定会抛弃自己的错误，同马列主义重新而且是比前更巩固地接近起来，只要上帝保佑他不过早地死掉。邓拓实际上是劝告人们：停止你们的反修斗争吧，他自己会回心转意，迟早你们之间还会握手言欢的！
    请看，邓拓仅仅是引用了一个例，但是这比他说一千句一万句美化赫鲁晓夫的话不更有用吗？邓拓仅仅是用了一个例，但是他为赫鲁晓夫翻案的全部内容不是和盘托出了吗？更恶毒的是，邓拓使用歪曲列宁著作的手法为赫鲁晓夫翻案，他以为这样别人就无法指责了。但是，列宁著作是无产阶级革命的理论武器，修正主义者企图把它变成为自己服务的工具是徒劳的。列宁著作不仅没有帮了邓拓的忙，相反却象一把锋利的匕首，戳穿了邓拓的政治阴谋，这叫做事物走向了反面。邓拓搬起石头打了自己脚，真是愚蠢而可悲！
    邓拓在报告中不仅美化赫鲁晓夫，而且也为赫鲁晓夫的难兄难弟陶里亚蒂、多列士辩护。说他们“当了多年总书记”，“是国际共产主义运动中的老资格”，所以犯错误，也只是因为“缺乏马列主义修养”，“看问题机械”，用“形式逻辑”。这不是公然反对我党在《再论陶里亚蒂同志同我们的分歧》等反修文章中的根本论点吗？
    邓拓为赫鲁晓夫修正主义者翻案的阴谋是决不能得逞的。历史上一切为叛徒辩护的人都得到了同叛徒相同的下场。这是阶级斗争的规律。一个小小的邓拓难道能够逃脱这条规律的支配而成为例外吗？
      邓拓攻击我党坚持
  无产阶级暴力革命学
  说，是“形而上学片面
  性的俘虏”
    邓拓在报告里，疯狂攻击无产阶级暴力革命学说，公然宣扬修正主义的“和平过渡”。他玩弄哲学概念说：只有将和平过渡同非和平过渡结合起来，才是“矛盾的统一，才是辩证地全面地看问题”。邓拓还歪曲地引用恩格斯的话污蔑我们单提武装夺取政权一种可能性是“片面地抓住一个观点，把它当做绝对的，和另一个观点对立”，污蔑我们党批判修正主义的“和平过渡”是不从实际出发，是“形而上学思维的片面性的俘虏”！
    毛主席概括的“枪杆子里面出政权”是马列主义的一条根本原理，是各国无产阶级革命的普遍规律。当我们党早已把现代修正主义的“和平过渡”谬论驳得体无完肤之后，邓拓仍然如此顽固地宣扬“和平过渡”，这表明：邓拓已经彻底背叛了马列主义，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义成了一丘之貉！邓拓眼睁睁地看着修正主义的“和平过渡”理论已经给许多国家的革命带来了惨重的损失，而仍然拼命鼓吹“和平过渡”的可能性，这表明，邓拓蓄意葬送各国革命，充当帝国主义的牧师。
    值得注意的是：在邓拓报告前一个月，恰恰苏共领导发表公开信的时候，在“公开信”里，苏共领导重弹了“和平过渡”的老调，而邓拓的言论竟然与其一模一样！看来邓拓是完全按照了赫鲁晓夫的旨意行事的，真称得起是赫鲁晓夫的忠实喉舌！
      邓拓把反修斗争说成是纯粹
  的哲学争论，阴谋瓦解和破坏反
  修斗争
    邓拓在报告里，竭力否认马列主义与修正主义的分歧是根本的路线分歧，他说：“对帝国主义的矛盾，……他们也承认这个矛盾，只不过要用妥协退让的办法来解决矛盾。”也就是说，我们和修正主义的矛盾不是反帝不反帝的问题，而只是方法上的分歧而已。
    在谈到分歧的原因时，他都归结为仅仅是由于“我们是辩证地全面地看问题，而他们是孤立地、片面地和形而上学地看问题。”就是这样，邓拓竟然把反对现代修正主义这场关系人类命运的严重斗争贬低为一场纯粹的哲学争论！
    我们同现代修正主义者的分歧仅仅是“策略不同”、“认识不同”吗？不，还是不要撒谎吧！你们明明知道，我们同你们即修正主义者们的分歧，归根到底，是要不要革命，要不要反帝，要不要马列主义和无产阶级国际主义的根本分歧。你们为什么不敢承认呢？你们害怕！列宁说的好：对于修正主义者来说：“最不愉快、最不乐意和最不能接受的，莫过于弄清理论上、纲领上、策略上和组织上的主要意见分歧了。”这段话不是刚好打中了你们的要害吗？
    邓拓这样说，是别有用心的。那就是：混淆马列主义与修正主义的界限，让革命的人们放弃对于修正主义的斗争，让修正主义思潮泛滥，让资本主义在中国复辟！因此，邓拓千方百计掩饰这场斗争的严重性，尖锐性，这件事实本身，就是一场严重的、尖锐的阶级斗争！邓拓！革命者的眼睛是模糊不了的，反修斗争是阻挠不了的，你们注定灭亡的命运是改变不了的！
    通过以上分析，读者不难看出，邓拓标榜自己的报告是讲解我党的《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》，实际上大肆宣传的却是苏共中央的“公开信”。据我们所知，苏共修正主义领导集团曾雇佣了一批所谓“宣传员”到苏联各地宣传“公开信”的反华观点。看来，送给邓拓一个苏共领导集团的“宣传鼓动员”的称号，恐怕是当之无愧的吧！
    由于邓拓是以市委书记处书记的身份打着解释中央文件的招牌来作报告的，而听众又是宣传工作的干部，因而影响是极为恶劣的。这笔账必须彻底清算，将邓拓之流的修正主义辩护士，世界上一切牛鬼蛇神通通打倒！
