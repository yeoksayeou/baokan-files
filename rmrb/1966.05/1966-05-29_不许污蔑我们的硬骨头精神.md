    Do Not Allow Slander of Our Hard-Bone Spirit
    Hu Xiudao, Former First-Class Hero and Special-Class Merit Citation Recipient of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    The director and screenwriter of "Red Sun" have severely distorted the image of our army's revolutionary soldiers. When several enemy shells landed around our fortifications, some people hurriedly crawled into the fortifications, curled up in the corners, and tightly covered their ears with their hands. One soldier said, "New recruits fear cannons, veterans fear machine guns."
    Do we really fear the enemy's cannons and machine guns? No! This is shameless slander! Our revolutionary soldiers have always been fearless.
    More than a decade ago, during the Battle of Shangganling in Korea, I was still a new soldier, not yet eighteen years old, and had just put on my uniform. The U.S. imperialism boasted that this battle was their "most fierce offensive." However, even though the bombs dropped by enemy aircraft turned the stones on the mountains into three-foot-thick powder, we had no fear at all. After the enemy's indiscriminate bombing, they charged towards us across the mountains and fields with a battalion of troops. As soon as I saw the American devils, the new and old hatreds surged into my heart. Thinking of the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, I gained confidence and courage. There was not a single "fear" in my heart, and I was determined to wipe out all the devils and avenge the people of China and Korea, and the people of the world. When the enemy climbed to within twenty meters of us, we calmly gave them a fierce beating, grabbed grenades, pulled the pins, and smashed them hard on the heads of the devils, beating them until they lost their souls, shit their pants, and crawled and rolled, fleeing down the mountain in a panic.
    After participating in the Battle of Shangganling, I deeply realized that U.S. imperialism is indeed a paper tiger, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, bullying the weak and fearing the strong. And we, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are the greatest fighting force!
    On the battlefield, there is only our bravery, where is the enemy's prestige! Our People's Liberation Army, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, has a high degree of class consciousness and has always been a hard bone that is not afraid of hardship or death. Our army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has always been the victor. The director and screenwriter of "Red Sun" have imposed the philosophy of survival at all costs on us. This is a malicious attack and slander against us. We, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, cannot be slandered by anyone!

    不许污蔑我们的硬骨头精神
    前中国人民志愿军一级英雄、特等功臣  胡修道
    《红日》的编导者严重地歪曲了我军革命战士的形象。当敌人的几发炮弹落在我军工事周围时，有的人急忙钻进工事蜷缩在角落里，还用双手紧紧捂住耳朵。有个战士说：“新兵怕炮，老兵怕机关枪。”
    我们真的会怕敌人的大炮、机关枪吗？不！这是无耻的污蔑！我们革命战士从来都是无所畏惧的。
    十几年前，在朝鲜上甘岭的战斗中，我还是一个不满十八岁、刚穿上军装的新战士。这次战役，美帝国主义吹嘘地说，是它们“攻势最猛烈”的一次。然而，尽管敌机丢下的炸弹把山上的石头炸成了三尺厚的粉末，我们却没有一点畏惧。敌人狂轰滥炸后，以一个营的兵力满山遍野向我们冲来，我一看到美国鬼子，新仇旧恨一齐涌上心头，想到党和毛主席的教导，就有了信心和勇气，心里没有半个“怕”字，决心把鬼子全部消灭，为中朝人民和世界人民报仇。当敌人爬到离我们只有二十来米时，我们沉着地给了他们一顿猛揍，抓起手榴弹，拉开弦狠狠地向鬼子的头上砸去，直打得鬼子丧魂落魄，屎滚尿流，爬的爬、滚的滚，狼狈逃下山去。
    参加上甘岭战斗后，我深刻地体会到，美帝国主义的确是一只纸老虎，外强中干，欺软怕硬。而我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，是最大的战斗力！
    在战场上，只有我们的勇敢，哪有敌人的威风！我们人民解放军在毛泽东思想的哺育下，有着高度的阶级觉悟，从来是不怕苦、不怕死的硬骨头。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队，从来都是胜利者。《红日》的编导者，把贪生怕死的活命哲学强加在我们头上，这是对我们恶毒的攻击和污蔑。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，是任何人污蔑不了的！
