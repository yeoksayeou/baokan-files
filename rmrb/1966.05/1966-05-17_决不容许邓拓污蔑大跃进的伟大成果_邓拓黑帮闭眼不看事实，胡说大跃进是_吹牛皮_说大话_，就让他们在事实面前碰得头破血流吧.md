    Absolutely No Tolerance for Deng Tuo's Slander of the Great Achievements of the Great Leap Forward
    The Deng Tuo Gang Closes Their Eyes to the Facts, Nonsensically Claiming the Great Leap Forward Was "Bragging" and "Boasting"; Let Them Be Smashed Headfirst Against the Facts!
    Tian Qifa, Representative of the National People's Congress, National Model of High Rice Yield

    After reading the materials exposing Deng Tuo's anti-Party, anti-socialist black talk in the newspaper, I was so angry I felt like I was going to explode. The Deng Tuo gang, in order to incite people to oppose the Party and oppose socialism, and attempting to achieve the goal of capitalist restoration, during the period when our national economy encountered temporary difficulties, coordinated with the rampant attacks of imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism against our country, echoing each other, and wildly slandered the Party's line and policies, saying that the Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "boasting," and would "smash their heads against the facts." This is complete nonsense and a reversal of black and white. Deng Tuo, we are poor and lower-middle peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and we see you demons and monsters very clearly.

    The Great Leap Forward, under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, was something our workers and peasants exchanged with their own hands through tenacious labor in order to rapidly develop the productive forces and quickly change our country's poor and blank state. The great achievements of the Great Leap Forward are well known and cannot be erased by you! The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Suifeng Brigade of the Wushenggong Commune in Nanxian, where I am located, still talk about the changes of the Great Leap Forward with joy, saying, "The achievements of the Great Leap Forward are unforgettable to us forever, and must be told to our children and grandchildren, passing them down from generation to generation."

    Before liberation, our Suifeng was a place of "three drops of drizzle, a patch of white; three suns to crack the fields." At that time, the dikes collapsed east and west, and the enclosure was a stagnant pool of water. Years of water and drought disasters took countless lives and destroyed countless properties. The broad masses of working people suffered from hunger and cold generation after generation, unable to make a living. In those years, how much the peasants longed to change the water conservancy conditions. However, the evil feudal landlord class didn't care about the life or death of us peasants. I remember in 1926, Suifeng was flooded, and the dikes burst, turning the entire enclosure into a vast expanse of water. More than 30 of our entire village of more than 400 farmers died from drowning, starvation, and disease. Four families were ruined, and even more people were separated from their wives and children, and went to other places, only three landlord families were towed to the streets of Changsha by a汽船. What an unforgettable scene!

    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Suifeng changed, and the water conservancy situation improved, especially in 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, when the People's Commune was established, providing favorable conditions for building water conservancy. In order to fundamentally eradicate floods, our poor and lower-middle peasants organized themselves and repaired dikes and dug canals. That winter, more than 300 male and female laborers in our Suifeng Brigade, braving the cold, went into battle together. After more than four months of hard work, solid work, and clever work, they built a strong new dike and drainage and irrigation canals. The amount of earthwork completed this year was equal to that of the seven years since liberation. This great change not only freed our Suifeng Brigade's more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields from the threat of water and drought disasters, but also provided many favorable conditions for stable and high agricultural yields. Due to the fundamental improvement of water conservancy conditions, a large amount of labor is saved every year for intensive cultivation of rice fields. At the same time, the area of green manure has expanded, the area of double-cropping rice has expanded, and the area of cultivated land has expanded, and agricultural production has developed rapidly. In recent years, grain output has been rising step by step. Last year, the average yield per mu of grain in our Suifeng Third Team reached 1,021 jin, an increase of more than two times compared with before liberation, and nearly one time more than before the Great Leap Forward. Production has developed, the lives of the commune members have been greatly improved, and the contribution to the country has greatly increased. These unprecedented miracles were created by our poor and lower-middle peasants with their own hands under the leadership of the Party and inspired by the General Line. Who can deny it! Who closes their eyes to the facts? Whoever says the Great Leap Forward was "bragging" and "boasting," let whoever be smashed headfirst against the facts!

    Deng Tuo and his ilk, using all their strength, used the past to satirize the present, attacking the Great Leap Forward, simply because they were afraid of the strength of our country, afraid of our great socialist construction cause, and trying to drag our country back, making our country go backwards, back to the old road of the Kuomintang, and suffer forever. Deng Tuo! We honestly tell you, you are daydreaming, wasting your efforts!

    决不容许邓拓污蔑大跃进的伟大成果
    邓拓黑帮闭眼不看事实，胡说大跃进是“吹牛皮”“说大话”，就让他们在事实面前碰得头破血流吧
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国水稻丰产模范　田启发
    看了报上揭露的邓拓反党反社会主义黑话的材料，气得我心都快要炸裂了。邓拓一伙为了煽动人们反党反社会主义，妄图达到资本主义复辟的目的，在我国国民经济遇到暂时困难的时期，配合帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义对我国的猖狂进攻，一唱一和，大肆污蔑党的路线和方针政策，说什么大跃进是“吹牛皮”、“说大话”，在事实面前“碰得头破血流”。这完全是胡说八道，颠倒黑白。邓拓，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农，对你们这些牛鬼蛇神是看得清清楚楚的。
    大跃进是在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国工人、农民为了迅速发展生产力，尽快改变我国一穷二白的面貌，用自己的双手顽强劳动换来的，大跃进的伟大成果，是众所周知的，你们抹煞不了！我所在的南县武圣宫公社岁丰大队的贫下中农至今一谈起大跃进的变化来，谁都满心欢喜地说：“大跃进的成就，叫我们永世难忘，要告诉子子孙孙，一代一代传下去。”
    解放前，我们岁丰是“三滴麻雨一片白，三个太阳田开坼”的地方，那时，大堤东崩西塌，垸内死水一潭，连年的水旱灾害，不知断送了多少人命，不知毁灭了多少财产，广大劳苦人民祖祖辈辈受饥挨冻，不得生涯，那年头，农民是多么渴望改变水利条件。可是，万恶的封建地主阶级，那管我们农民的死活。记得一九二六年，我们岁丰洪水泛滥，大堤溃决，全垸一片汪洋。我们全村四百多个农民，光淹死、饿死和病死的达三十多人，有四户家破人亡，还有更多的人妻离子散，投奔他乡，唯有三户地主一汽船拖到长沙逛大街去了。这是多么难忘的情景呵！
    解放后，在党的领导下，岁丰变了，水利面貌改观了，特别是大跃进的一九五八年成立人民公社，为兴办水利提供了有利条件。我们贫下中农为了从根本上根除水患，纷纷组织起来，维修大堤，开挖渠道。这年冬天，我们岁丰大队三百多个男女劳动力，不畏天寒地冻，一齐上阵，经过四个多月的苦干实干巧干，就修起了牢固的新堤和排灌渠道。这一年所完成的土方等于解放七年来那样多。这个伟大的变化，不仅使我们岁丰大队的二千多亩水田，摆脱了水旱灾害的威胁，而且为农业的稳产高产提供了许多有利条件。由于水利条件的根本改观，每年便节省大量劳动力，用于稻田的精耕细作，同时，绿肥面积扩大了，双季稻面积扩大了，耕地面积扩大了，农业生产获得了迅速发展。这些年来，粮食产量步步高升。去年我们岁丰三队粮食平均亩产达一千零二十一斤，比解放前增产两倍多，比大跃进以前也增产将近一倍。生产发展了，社员的生活大大改善了，对国家的贡献大大增加了。这些史无前例的奇迹，都是在党的领导下，在总路线的鼓舞下，我们贫下中农用自己的双手创造出来的。谁能否认！谁闭眼不看事实？谁说大跃进是“吹牛皮”“说大话”，就让谁在事实面前碰得头破血流吧！
    邓拓之流，使尽吃奶的气力，借古骂今，攻击大跃进，无非是害怕我们国家的强大，害怕我们伟大的社会主义建设事业，妄图拖我们国家的后腿，使我们的国家走回头路，回到国民党的老路上去，永远受苦受难。邓拓！我们老实告诉你，你这是白日作梦，枉费心机！
