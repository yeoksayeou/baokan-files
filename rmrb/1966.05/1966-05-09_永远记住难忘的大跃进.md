    Always Remember the Unforgettable Great Leap Forward
    Worker of Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, Liu Zhen
    In "Evening Talks at Yanshan," Deng Tuo launched a venomous and comprehensive attack on our great Party and the Party's General Line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward. He repeatedly insulted our great Party by calling it "bragging," "fanatical," "running a high fever," and speaking "grand empty words," suffering from "amnesia." This is utter nonsense!
    In 1958, we, the entire workforce of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant, like the people of the whole country, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and under the guidance of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, experienced a great leap forward in production. The Great Leap Forward of 1958 is unforgettable. In that year, our factory built a freight car branch; in that year, our workers displayed soaring revolutionary zeal and, in a matter of dozens of days, built a steam locomotive, ending our factory's decades-long history of only being able to repair locomotives. 1958 was the year of the Great Leap Forward, a year to be remembered forever. All this was under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, turning our ideals into reality. Why does Deng Tuo slander our Party for "reneging on its words," being "untrustworthy," and suffering from "amnesia"? There is only one answer: Deng Tuo is an anti-Party and anti-socialist element, and therefore he is, of course, extremely unhappy with the achievements made by our Party and the people.

    永远记住难忘的大跃进
    长辛店机车车辆厂工人　刘振
    邓拓在《燕山夜话》里，对我们伟大的党，对党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进，进行了恶毒的全面的攻击。他百般辱骂我们伟大的党“吹牛皮”、“狂热”、“发高烧”、说“伟大的空话”，害了“健忘症”。这是彻底的胡说八道！
    一九五八年，我们长辛店机车车辆工厂全体工人，同全国人民一样，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，在生产上来了一个大跃进。一九五八年的大跃进是难忘的。那一年，我们厂修建了货车分厂；那一年，我们工人发挥了冲天的革命干劲，用几十天的时间，造出了蒸汽机车，结束了我们厂几十年来只能修理机车的历史。一九五八年是大跃进的年代，是永远难忘的一年。这一切都是在党和毛主席的领导下，使我们的理想变成现实。为什么邓拓污蔑我们党“自食其言”，“言而无信”，害了“健忘症”呢？答案只有一个，这就是，邓拓是反党反社会主义分子，因此他对我们党和人民所取得的成就，当然是极不高兴的。
