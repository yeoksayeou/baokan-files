    The socialist system cannot be breached, the seal of the proletarian dictatorship cannot be seized, and the locomotive of the Cultural Revolution must advance forward. The working class charges forward on the production front and dares to fight and struggle on the political, ideological, and cultural fronts.

    Seeing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha, this gang of counter-revolutionaries, our hearts are filled with soaring anger. These guys wildly attacked the Party and socialism, and even wanted to shut our mouths, telling us to "say less," to "rest," and "not waste time and energy." This is a pipe dream, it can't be done! Our workers have spoken, our peasants have spoken, and our People's Liberation Army has spoken. This is tit-for-tat, a sharp confrontation. As long as you oppose the Party and oppose socialism, as long as you are enemies of the people, our working class has the right to wield the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought. No matter if you are three *juren* or four *jinshi*, black speech experts, or heads of several villages, we will fight you until you honestly bow your heads, confess your crimes, surrender, and disarm.

    The gang headed by Deng Tuo is simply too outrageous. You want imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism to ride on the backs of our working people again, defecating and urinating on us. You want to enshrine those reactionary "eclectics" as ancestral tablets, and even pass on their lineage, afraid these precious species will become extinct. You dream of the exploiting classes taking power and the working people being overthrown, wanting us to return to a dark and sunless world. We workers, peasants, and soldiers will not allow it! U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries have opened a general store in the international arena, jointly opposing China; you also want to share the profits, hurriedly opening a branch store by joining in a partnership. You think you have a strong backbone by relying on the big bosses internationally and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists domestically as your second bosses, and for a time you are so smug and pleased with yourselves, as if the sky is about to change, clamoring that "the earth will soon thaw." Your shopkeeper Deng Tuo has miscalculated. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are only a small handful, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, plus your gang, are also only a small handful, accounting for only a few percent of the total population. You are really overestimating yourselves by putting yourselves in opposition to more than 90 percent of the people. You should know that imperialism's life is not long, modern revisionism's days are not good, and the black shop you are running will also close down. This is not some "great empty talk," but an honest and correct judgment. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao led us working people to stand up. We working people have never felt so proud and elated as we do today; our lives have never been so good; our country has never been so strong. We will also take big strides and fly towards communism, to better build socialism and support the world revolution. Are you, this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, blind and deaf? You are walking on a path that runs counter to ours. We promote Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the idea of people's war, and you want us to deviate from the "canon" of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and betray the "path" of people's revolutionary war; we engage in promoting the proletarian ideology and eliminating the bourgeois ideology, and you want us to inherit the morality of feudalism and capitalism; we adhere to the general line of socialist construction, and you scold us for being "feverish," "having a high fever," and "bragging"; we want to establish heroes like Jiao Yulu, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie, and you promote emperors, generals, ministers, scholars, and beauties, praising the landlord heads to the skies; we uphold the people's commune and strike at capitalist forces, and you encourage individual farming. Right opportunists curse the Party and attack socialism, and you shout and cheer for them; right opportunists are removed from office, and you speak out in their defense, encouraging them to make a comeback, to "try again after failure." It is obvious that you are acting to meet the needs of imperialism, modern revisionism, and domestic landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

    A few years ago, our country suffered natural disasters, imperialism wanted to attack us, and revisionism wanted to strangle us, preventing us from building socialism. Our people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions to build socialism well, refusing to be manipulated by revisionism. You do what you want, we do what we do, and our working class will fight for this breath. The people of the whole country unite around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and in order to defend the Party's general line of socialist construction, our working class will fight to the end against heaven, against earth, and against you monsters and demons. I am a train driver, and in order to seize time and speed with imperialism, I am not afraid to put in more effort and sweat more. One train hauls more than two thousand tons, three thousand tons, even four thousand tons. In the past, we ran forty or fifty kilometers per hour, now we run sixty kilometers all the way up to eighty kilometers and ninety-five kilometers. I drive like flying, others call me Flying Car Huang. Flying car is flying car, socialist construction must have a flying spirit. Our country is poor, so we have to build it with greater effort. Slow and steady will lead to backwardness, and backwardness will be bullied by the enemy. My comrades consciously practice hard under the big steam valve and low hand lever, practicing today, practicing tomorrow, practicing in the wind, practicing in the rain, practicing in the dark, practicing in the day, practicing a set of fast, accurate, and stable Chinese-style driving methods. My comrades say, being in front of the furnace door, we observe the world, with our hearts set on revolution, we are not afraid of dying from exhaustion. We practice single-handed operation, high-speed operation. In wartime, if one arm is broken, we still have one arm to drive with. Our comrades practice "night tiger" skills, being able to quickly and accurately throw coal and correctly judge the boiler steam pressure with the lights off. We drive for the revolution, we work consciously. Deng Tuo and his gang of ugly people cursed us for being "feverish," "having a high fever," attacked the Party's general line and the Great Leap Forward, and slandered the Party for "not cherishing labor," wanting our Party to "gain new inspiration from the experience of the ancients." This sings the same tune as U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, and all of this is a vicious attack. Deng Tuo also attacked us for destroying "the belongings of an egg" by implementing the general line and the Great Leap Forward. We are indeed going to destroy some people's belongings, destroy the belongings of landlords and the belongings of capitalism, and the belongings of your black shop will also be completely destroyed. We implement the general line and the Great Leap Forward, the proletarian dictatorship is consolidated, the socialist system is stronger, the atomic bomb is in the sky, the 12,000-ton hydraulic press is born, the Daqing Oilfield is gushing oil, the barren mountains in Dazhai have changed, and the Handan Railway in Hubei Province is open to traffic... Isn't this the power of the Party's general line? Isn't this the great product of the Great Leap Forward? Deng Tuo and his gang of monsters and demons oppose the general line, and we are even more determined to implement the Party's general line. You oppose the Great Leap Forward, and we will continue the Great Leap Forward.

    The wheel of history is turning forward, and you are frantically trying to push it backward. This can only be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, and it will not end well. Our workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army soldiers, under the wise leadership of the Party, form a solid worker-peasant alliance, which is an impregnable fortress that cannot be smashed or scolded down.

    Where there are classes, there is class struggle. Monsters and demons will always come out, and poisonous weeds will always come out. When they come out, we will catch them, and when we find them, we will pull them out. Chairman Mao's works are the supreme instructions for all our work. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of anything, not afraid of imperialism, and will eliminate imperialism; not afraid of monsters and demons, and will overthrow monsters and demons. Deng Tuo and his ilk, listen up! With the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the world of the proletariat cannot be overturned, and the socialist system cannot be breached! The seal of the proletarian dictatorship cannot be seized! We must occupy this position in the cultural field, and the revolutionary locomotive must advance forward.

    The working class must charge forward on the production front and dare to fight and struggle on the political, ideological, and cultural fronts. Monsters and demons attack the Party and socialism from the stage, the screen, and the newspapers, and we must take over these positions one by one. Our railway workers cannot only look at steam locomotives, but must also immediately participate in the battle of the Great Cultural Revolution. We cannot only manage to fully open the steam valve, lower the hand lever, and wave the coal shovel, but also firmly grasp the gun and pick up the pen, defend the seal of the proletariat, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely advance. We will never stop until we have won a complete victory.

    革命的火车头要把“三家村”碾成碎粉
    社会主义制度是攻不破的，无产阶级专政的印把子是夺不去的，文化革命的火车头是一定要向前开的。工人阶级在生产战线上冲锋陷阵，在政治、思想、文化战线上，也敢打敢拼
    江岸机务段一四七九号机车司机长　黄义臣
    看到邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙这帮反党、反社会主义分子，进行反党反社会主义的罪行，我们心头怒火升得老高。这些家伙对党对社会主义大肆攻击，还想要捂住我们的嘴巴，叫咱“少说一些”，去“休息”，“不要浪费时间和精力”，这是白日作梦，办不到！咱们工人说话了，咱们农民说话了，咱们解放军说话了。这才是有来有往，针锋相对。只要你反党反社会主义，只要你与人民为敌，咱工人阶级就有权抡起毛泽东思想的千钧大棒，不管你是三举人或者是四进士，是黑话专家，还是几家村的头佬，都要跟你斗，揍得你老老实实的低头认罪投降缴械为止。
    以邓拓为首的这一群黑帮，简直欺人太甚啦。你们想叫帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义，重新骑在咱劳动人民头上拉粪拉尿，要把那些反动的“杂家”当祖宗牌供奉起来，还要为“杂家”传宗接代，生怕这几种宝贝绝了种。梦想剥削阶级上台，劳动人民下台，要咱回到暗无天日的世界，咱们工农兵不答应！美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，三家在国际开了一家总店，联合反华；你们也想从中分红得利，急急忙忙合股开了分店，自以为靠着国际上的大老板，又有国内的地富反坏右做二老板，腰杆子挺硬，一时神气得不得了，好象天就要变了，叫嚷“大地很快就要解冻了”。你们的掌柜邓拓的算盘珠子拨错了，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派只是一小撮，地、富、反、坏、右再加上你们一伙，也只是一小撮，只占人口总数的百分之几。你们把自己放在同百分之九十以上的人民相对立的地位，真是自不量力。要晓得，帝国主义寿命不长了，现代修正主义日子不好混了，你们这一伙经营的黑店也要倒闭了，这不是什么“伟大的空话”，而是地地道道的实话，是英明正确的论断。党中央、毛主席领导咱们劳动人民翻了身，咱劳动人民从来没有象今天这样扬眉吐气；咱们生活从来没有象今天这样美好；咱们国家从来没有象今天这样强大。咱们还要迈开步子，往共产主义飞跑，要更好地建设社会主义，支援世界革命。你们这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，是瞎子，是聋子？你们走的是一条和我们背道而驰的道路。我们宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，宣传人民战争的思想，你们要我们离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之“经”，叛人民革命战争之“道”；我们搞兴无灭资，你们要我们继承封建主义、资本主义的道德；我们坚持社会主义建设总路线，你们就骂咱是“狂热”“发高烧”“吹牛皮”；我们要树立焦裕禄、雷锋、王杰式的英雄人物，你们搞帝王将相、才子佳人，把地主头子捧上天；我们坚持人民公社，打击资本主义势力，你们鼓励搞单干。右倾机会主义分子咒骂党，攻击社会主义，你们为他们呐喊助威；右倾机会主义分子被罢了官，你们为他们打抱不平，鼓励他们东山再起，“失败了再干”。显而易见，你们是适应帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内地富反坏右分子的需要行事的。
    前几年咱国家遭到天灾，帝国主义要打咱，修正主义想卡住咱的脖子，不要咱建设社会主义，咱们全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按毛主席的指示办事，把社会主义建设好，偏不挨修正主义的整。你整你的，咱干咱的，咱工人阶级就要争这口气。全国人民团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，为着保卫党的社会主义建设总路线，咱工人阶级与天斗、与地斗、与你们牛鬼蛇神斗到底。我是个开火车的，为着和帝国主义抢时间，争速度，不怕多出力，多冒汗，一趟车拉二千多吨，三千多吨，就是四千多吨也还是拉；过去每小时跑四十多公里，五十公里，现在跑六十公里一直到八十公里、九十五公里。咱开车如飞，别人叫咱飞车黄，飞车就飞车，建设社会主义就要有个飞劲。咱国家穷，咱就加劲建设，慢慢吞吞就要落后，落后就要受到敌人欺负。咱的伙计们都自觉地在大汽门、低手把下面练功夫，今天练，明天练，风里练，雨里练，黑夜练，白日练，练出一套又快、又准，又稳的中国式的开车法。咱伙计们说，身在炉门下，两眼观天下，一心为革命，累死也不怕。咱练单手操纵，高速运行，打起仗来，打断一只胳膀还有一只胳膀开车；咱伙计练“夜老虎”本领，关着电机能快速准确投煤，正确判断锅炉汽压。咱是为革命开车，咱是自觉劳动。邓拓这些群丑们咒骂我们“狂热”、“发高烧”，攻击党的总路线、大跃进，诬蔑党“不爱护劳动力”，要我们党“从古人的经验中得到新的启发”，这和美帝国主义、现代修正主义唱的是一个腔调，这通通都是恶毒的攻击。邓拓还攻击我们执行总路线、大跃进“把一个鸡蛋的家当”毁掉了。我们的确是要毁掉一些人的家当，要毁掉地主的家当、资本主义的家当，你们那黑店的家当也要彻底毁掉。我们执行总路线、大跃进，无产阶级专政巩固了，社会主义制度更强大了，原子弹上天了，一万二千吨水压机出世了，大庆油田哗哗冒油了，大寨那里的荒山变样了，湖北省汉丹铁路通车了……这不是党的总路线的威力吗？不是大跃进的伟大产物吗？邓拓之流牛鬼蛇神反对总路线，咱们越是坚定不移执行党的总路线，你们反对大跃进，咱们要继续大跃进。
    历史的车轮是朝前转的，你们气急败坏地要往后推，这只能是螳臂挡车，不会有好下场的。咱工人、农民、解放军战士，在党的英明领导下，形成巩固的工农联盟，是铜墙铁壁，是砸不碎、骂不倒的。
    有阶级，就有阶级斗争，牛鬼蛇神总是要出笼的，毒草也总是要出来的，出笼了，咱们就要逮住，发现了就要锄掉。毛主席著作就是我们一切工作的最高指示，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，天不怕、地不怕、不怕帝国主义，还要消灭帝国主义，不怕牛鬼蛇神，还要打倒牛鬼蛇神。邓拓之流听着，我们有党中央和毛主席英明领导，无产阶级天下是翻不了的，社会主义制度是攻不破的！无产阶级专政的印把子是夺不去的！文化领域这块阵地，我们一定要占领，革命的火车头是一定要向前开的。
    工人阶级在生产战线上要冲锋陷阵，在政治思想文化战线上，要敢打敢拼。牛鬼蛇神从舞台上、银幕上、报刊上向党向社会主义进攻，咱们就要把这些阵地一个一个夺过来。咱铁路工人不能两眼只看蒸汽机车，还要立即参加文化大革命的战斗。不能只管满开汽门，低放手把，挥舞煤锹，还要紧握枪杆、拿起笔杆，保卫无产阶级印把子，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进，不获全胜，决不收兵。
