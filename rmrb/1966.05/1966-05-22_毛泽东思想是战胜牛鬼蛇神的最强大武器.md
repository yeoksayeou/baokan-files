    Mao Zedong Thought is the Most Powerful Weapon to Defeat Demons and Monsters
    The fate of our proletariat is closely linked to the great Mao Zedong Thought. The class enemies hate Mao Zedong Thought so much precisely because they fear this great truth of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Political Instructor of an Air Force Unit on the Fujian Front, Feng Fusheng
    Deng Tuo, the shopkeeper of the "Three Family Village" black inn, viciously slandered our great Mao Zedong Thought and attacked our great Party. The crimes of this black gang make me extremely angry.
    The great Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, a universal truth applicable everywhere, a magic weapon for the proletariat to carry out revolutionary struggles victoriously, a beacon for the working people to advance, and the red sun in our hearts that never sets. With Mao Zedong Thought, we workers, peasants, and soldiers have everything. The fate of our proletariat is closely linked to the great and glorious Mao Zedong Thought. The class enemies hate Mao Zedong Thought so much precisely because they fear this great truth of Mao Zedong Thought. The Deng Tuo black gang openly opposes Mao Zedong Thought in an attempt to make our proletarian revolution lose its direction, vainly hoping to drag us back to the old capitalist road, and make us slaves of landlords and capitalists again. We want to warn all demons and monsters of the Three Family Village and Four Family Shops: This is a pipe dream!
    We workers, peasants, and soldiers will never forget the suffering of the old society. I started herding cows for landlords at the age of thirteen. At fourteen, I was forced to be a laborer for the Japanese devils. At fifteen, I left my hometown and went to work as an apprentice in a capitalist's restaurant, where I was beaten and scolded, doing the work of cattle and horses and eating the food of pigs and dogs. Finally, after struggling through, I awaited liberation, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came, and I completely turned over and became the master of the country. After liberation, nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought, I grew from a miserable child called a "fool" in the old society into a revolutionary fighter, fighting on the glorious post of defending the motherland, serving the Chinese people and the people of the world. The great Mao Zedong Thought is my guiding light. I have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's works. I can eat less food and sleep less, but I cannot go a day without reading Chairman Mao's books. I read Chairman Mao's books every day and listen to Chairman Mao's words every day, as if I were by Chairman Mao's side. It is Mao Zedong Thought that gave me wisdom and strength. The more I learn, the more I love to learn, and the more I learn, the more I love Mao Zedong Thought!
    The Deng Tuo black gang frantically slanders Mao Zedong Thought as "empty words." This is a vicious rant, and I really want to knock their teeth out! It was under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought that we working people, who were hungry and cold and suffered all kinds of hardships in the cannibalistic old society, achieved revolutionary victory and were liberated and turned over. Is this "empty words"?
    In the old society, we working people were persecuted, humiliated, not treated as human beings, and had no social status. After liberation, we became the masters of the country. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, our wisdom and talents can be fully utilized, and we can actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our great motherland is leaping forward at a rapid pace, and how many advanced units like Daqing and Dazhai have emerged; how many heroic figures like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Mai Xiande have emerged. Are these "empty words"?
    "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind," and "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" are Chairman Mao's scientific judgments on the world revolutionary situation and are irrefutable truths. This brilliant judgment greatly encourages the revolutionary people of the world and points out the bright future for the revolutionary people of the world. Are these "empty words"? Deng Tuo and his ilk, open your eyes and look at the current international situation. The tide of the world opposing imperialism and modern revisionism is rising higher and higher, shaking the foundations of imperialism and all reactionaries. These many iron facts fully prove the great glory of Mao Zedong Thought. Let you, this small handful of demons and monsters, tremble before the great Mao Zedong Thought!
    Chairman Mao said, "It is a good thing to be opposed by the enemy and not a bad thing." The enemy's slander of Mao Zedong Thought further proves the greatness, wisdom, and correctness of Mao Zedong Thought. The more the enemy opposes Mao Zedong Thought, the more we love Mao Zedong Thought. Now the people of the world all recognize that every word in Chairman Mao's books is the truth, and every sentence speaks the words in the hearts of the proletariat and the working people. We workers, peasants, and soldiers can listen to, remember, and use every word and sentence of Chairman Mao's books, and the more we learn, the brighter our hearts become. The Deng Tuo black gang stands on the reactionary position of opposing the Party and opposing the people, fears Mao Zedong Thought, hates Mao Zedong Thought, fears that we will arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and fears that we will study Chairman Mao's works and "popularize them." We must study Chairman Mao's works more conscientiously and use Chairman Mao's works better. We must carry out the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works more universally and deeply!
    Through the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works, transforming my thinking, and improving my work, the canteen in my unit has achieved "five goods" for many years. After serving as the political instructor of the supply section last year, I and all the comrades in the section worked even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we went deep into practice, conducted investigations and research, and vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought. Not only has my own class consciousness been continuously improved, but our supply section has also been rated as a "four goods" section. I deeply realize that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the foundation for us to do a good job in revolutionary work and is the source of strength and happiness for the people of the whole country and the people of the world!
    Without the great Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no revolutionary victory. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought will be battered and bruised! Under the attack of Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful weapon, Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek failed; Khrushchev's modern revisionists also went bankrupt; Deng Tuo, this small group of anti-Party and anti-socialist black gangs, can only end up in a shameful end of complete failure!
    Dark clouds cannot block the sun, and lies cannot cover up the truth. The Deng Tuo black gang's curse cannot damage a single hair of our great Mao Zedong Thought. On the contrary, they are lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet, acting as negative teachers for us, brightening our eyes, arousing our stronger class hatred, and making us more firmly believe in the brilliance and greatness of Mao Zedong Thought.
    The Deng Tuo black gang will never be able to stop the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Not only do we Chinese people love Chairman Mao's books, but the people of the world also love Chairman Mao's books. We will not only study now, but we will study forever; not only will our generation study, but our children and grandchildren will also study. We must pass on the great Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation!
    I am a revolutionary fighter. I want to defend every inch of the position of Mao Zedong Thought and will never allow any enemy to infringe on every sentence and every word of it. I want to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the socialist cultural revolution, stand at the forefront of this struggle, fiercely fire at all demons and monsters, and completely defeat the rampant attack of the Deng Tuo black gang!
    Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    毛泽东思想是战胜牛鬼蛇神的最强大武器
    我们无产阶级的命运与伟大的毛泽东思想紧密联系在一起。阶级敌人如此仇视毛泽东思想，正是因为他们害怕毛泽东思想这个伟大真理
    福建前线空军某部政治指导员　丰福生
    “三家村”黑店掌柜邓拓恶毒诋毁我们伟大的毛泽东思想，攻击我们伟大的党，这个黑帮的罪行，使我无比愤怒。
    伟大的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是无产阶级胜利地进行革命斗争的法宝，是劳动人民前进的灯塔，是我们心里永远不落的红太阳。有了毛泽东思想，就有了我们工农兵的一切。我们无产阶级的命运与伟大光辉的毛泽东思想紧密地联系在一起。阶级敌人如此仇视毛泽东思想，正是因为他们害怕毛泽东思想这个伟大的真理。邓拓黑帮公开反对毛泽东思想，就是企图使我们无产阶级革命迷失方向，妄想把我们拉回资本主义的老路，要我们重新给地主资本家做牛做马。我们要警告一切三家村、四家店的牛鬼蛇神：这是白日做梦！
    旧社会的苦难，我们工农兵是不会忘记的。我十三岁就给地主放牛。十四岁那年，我被迫给日本鬼子当劳工。十五岁，我背井离乡到资本家的饭店里当徒工，挨打受骂，干的是牛马活，吃的是猪狗食。好不容易熬到解放，盼来了共产党和毛主席，我才彻底翻了身，成了国家的主人。解放以后，我在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，由一个旧社会被人称为“呆子”的苦孩子成长为革命战士，战斗在保卫祖国的光荣岗位上，为中国人民和全世界人民服务。伟大的毛泽东思想，是我的指路明灯，我对毛主席著作有最深的感情，我饭可以少吃，觉可以少睡，但是不能一天不读毛主席的书。我每天读毛主席的书，每天听毛主席的话，就好象在毛主席的身边一样。是毛泽东思想给了我智慧，给了我力量。我越学越爱学，越学就更加热爱毛泽东思想！
    邓拓黑帮疯狂诬蔑毛泽东思想是“空话”。这是恶毒的狂吠，我真想敲掉他们的牙！我们劳动人民在吃人的旧社会饥寒交迫，受尽苦难，正是在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下取得了革命的胜利，才得到解放翻身。这难道是“空话”吗？
    在旧社会，我们劳动人民被迫害、被凌辱，不被当人看待，没有社会地位。解放后，我们成了国家的主人。在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，我们的智慧才能得到充分的发挥，积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设。我们伟大的祖国一日千里地向前跃进，涌现出多少大庆、大寨式的先进单位；涌现出多少雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、麦贤得式的英雄人物，难道这是“空话”吗？
    “东风压倒西风”、“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，是毛主席对世界革命形势的科学论断，是颠扑不破的真理，这个英明的论断，给全世界革命人民以极大鼓舞，指出了全世界革命人民的光明前途，这难道是“空话”吗？邓拓之流，你们睁开眼睛看看当前的国际形势，全世界反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义的浪潮一浪高过一浪，正在动摇着帝国主义和一切反动派的根基。这许多铁的事实，充分地证明毛泽东思想的伟大光辉。让你们这一小撮牛鬼蛇神在伟大的毛泽东思想面前发抖吧！
    毛主席说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。敌人诋毁毛泽东思想，更加证明毛泽东思想的伟大、英明和正确。敌人越是反对毛泽东思想，我们就越是热爱毛泽东思想。现在全世界人民都认定毛主席的书，字字是真理，句句说的是无产阶级、劳动人民心里的话。我们工农兵读毛主席的书，字字句句听得进，记得牢，用得上，越学心越亮。邓拓黑帮站在反党反人民的反动立场上，害怕毛泽东思想，仇视毛泽东思想，害怕我们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，害怕我们学习毛主席著作“普遍化起来”，我们要更加认真地学习毛主席著作，更好地运用毛主席著作。我们一定要把学习毛主席著作的运动更普遍、更深入地开展起来！
    我经过活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，改进工作，我所在的单位食堂曾连年实现了“五好”。去年到给养科担任了政治指导员以后，我和全科同志一道更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，按照毛主席的教导，深入实践，调查研究，大力宣传毛泽东思想。不仅我自己的阶级觉悟不断提高，而且我们的给养科也被评上了“四好”科。我深深体会到：伟大的毛泽东思想是我们做好革命工作的根本，是全国人民和全世界人民力量和幸福的源泉！
    离开伟大的毛泽东思想，就没有革命的胜利。谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就要碰得头破血流！在毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器打击下，日本帝国主义、美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石失败了；赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者也破产了；邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义黑帮，也只能落得彻底失败的可耻下场！
    乌云遮不住太阳，谎言掩盖不住真理。邓拓黑帮的咒骂，损伤不了我们伟大毛泽东思想的一根毫毛。相反的，他们是搬起了石头砸自己的脚，给我们充当了反面教员，擦亮了我们的眼睛，激起了我们更强烈的阶级仇恨，使我们更加坚信毛泽东思想的英明伟大。
    邓拓黑帮永远也阻挡不了伟大的毛泽东思想的传播。不仅我们中国人民热爱毛主席的书，全世界人民也都热爱毛主席的书。我们不仅现在学，而且永远要学；不仅我们这一代学，而且子子孙孙都要学。我们一定要把伟大的毛泽东思想一代一代地传下去！
    我是一个革命战士，我要捍卫毛泽东思想的每一寸阵地，绝不允许任何敌人侵犯它的每一句话，每一个字。我要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加社会主义文化大革命，站在这个斗争的最前列，勇猛地向一切牛鬼蛇神开火，彻底打垮邓拓黑帮的猖狂进攻！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
