    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th. This reporter reports: Sholokhov, a leading figure in modern Soviet revisionist literature, engaged in activities in Japan for nearly three weeks, from May 10th to 28th, serving the Soviet revisionist leading group's policy of "Soviet-Japanese cooperation" to jointly oppose China.

    In recent years, Sholokhov has traveled abroad many times, actively implementing the Soviet revisionist leading group's reactionary policy of Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world, peddling anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people black goods. As early as 1964, when the Soviet leadership began secretly wooing the United States' anti-China pawn in the Far East, the Japanese Sato government, Sholokhov wrote a letter to Mrs. Abe, a Japanese embassy stenographer he had met in Moscow thirty years earlier, expressing his intention to go to Japan to "visit" her illness. Recently, shortly after Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato expressed his acceptance of an invitation to visit the Soviet Union, Sholokhov's visit to Japan was realized.

    As soon as Sholokhov, along with his wife, children, and personnel from the Soviet Writers' Union, set foot on Japanese soil, they were warmly received by the Japanese reactionaries and bourgeois writers as "state guests." Japanese bourgeois public opinion nauseatingly praised him, lavishing praise on his reactionary works such as "A Man's Fate" and "And Quiet Flows the Don," which oppose revolutionary war, glorify traitorous cowards, and uglify the Soviet people and army.

    At a press conference in Tokyo on the 26th, when Japanese reporters asked him what he thought of the articles in China's "People's Daily" exposing his traitorous face, Sholokhov said in embarrassment, "I have nothing to say on this question." Apart from cursing, he dared not answer any substantive questions.

    During his activities in Japan, Sholokhov seized every opportunity to vigorously promote "super-class," "abstract" bourgeois humanism, and peddle the fallacy of class cooperation. At a symposium with some Japanese writers on television on the 24th, when it was pointed out that he beautified counter-revolutionaries in his book "And Quiet Flows the Don," he shamelessly replied, "Because they are human." On the 25th, at a symposium attended by Japanese reactionary writers and traitors to the Japanese Communist Party, he clamored, "The general task of writers is to further elevate people's souls and create literature worthy of modern people." He also advised young writers to sell themselves, saying, "A young writer, as long as he has the living conditions (i.e., economic conditions) to spend three or four years writing a work, that writer can grow up. I suggest Japanese young writers marry the daughters of millionaires."

    This so-called "proletarian writer" vigorously praised Japan's capitalist society. According to Japan's "Yomiuri Shimbun," at the "birthday celebration" held by the Japan Literary Artists Association for Sholokhov's sixty-first birthday on the 24th, "with tears in his eyes, he said with endless emotion that Japan is so good. If I had known it was so good here, I should have come earlier." He also said on Tokyo television that he "loves everything about Japan."

    Sholokhov traveled around Japan, sightseeing, eating, and drinking, showing no interest whatsoever in the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents. The day after his arrival in Japan, he expressed great appreciation for the decadent capitalist society of the Ginza district and Asakusa in downtown Tokyo. According to Japanese newspapers, whenever he entered a store, he always put on the airs of a "big shot," saying, "I have money, give me the high-end stuff." Even a Japanese bourgeois newspaper, "Modern Weekly," considered him a "Soviet nouveau riche who has forgotten the workers." According to this weekly, Japanese people who received Sholokhov said, "Seeing the lifestyle of the Sholokhov family during their stay in Japan, they all said in unison that they could never have imagined that they were people from a communist country."

    肖洛霍夫访日为“苏日合作”反华效劳
    对我国报刊揭露他的叛徒面目感到狼狈不堪不敢回答  日资产阶级报刊讥讽他是“忘记了工人的苏联新贵族”
    新华社二十九日讯　本社记者报道：苏联现代修正主义文艺主将肖洛霍夫从五月十日到二十八日在日本活动了近三个星期，为苏联修正主义领导集团的“苏日合作”共同反华政策服务。
    最近几年，肖洛霍夫曾经多次出国活动，积极执行苏联修正主义领导集团的苏美合作主宰世界的反动政策，兜售反华、反共、反人民的黑货。早在一九六四年，苏联领导集团开始暗中拉拢美国在远东的反华走卒日本佐藤政府的时候，肖洛霍夫就写信给他在三十年前在莫斯科认识的日本大使馆女速记员阿部，表示要到日本去“探望”她的病。最近，在日本首相佐藤荣作表示接受访苏邀请之后不久，肖洛霍夫的访日计划也就实现了。
    肖洛霍夫带了老婆儿女和苏联作家协会的人员一踏上日本的土地，就被日本反动派和资产阶级作家当作“国宾”一般，热烈招待。日本资产阶级舆论令人作呕地吹捧他，对他写的反对革命战争、美化叛徒懦夫、丑化苏联人民和军队的《一个人的命运》、《静静的顿河》等反动作品，大加赞赏。
    肖洛霍夫二十六日在东京举行记者招待会时，日本记者问他对中国《人民日报》揭露他叛徒真面目的文章有何看法。肖洛霍夫狼狈不堪地说：“对于这个问题，我没有什么要说的。”他除了谩骂以外，对于实质问题不敢作任何回答。
    肖洛霍夫在日本活动期间，一有机会便大事宣扬“超阶级”的、“抽象”的资产阶级人性论，鼓吹阶级合作的谬论。他二十四日在电视台同日本一些作家举行座谈会时，别人提出他在《静静的顿河》一书中美化反革命分子的问题，他竟然恬不知耻地回答说：“因为他们是人”。二十五日，他在一个有日本反动作家和日共叛徒参加的座谈会上叫嚷说：“作家的一般性任务，就是要进一步提高人们的灵魂，创造不愧为现代人的文学”。他还劝告年青作家出卖自己，他说：“一个年青的作家，只要他有花费三四年时间写一部作品的生活条件（即经济条件），这个作家就能成长起来。我建议日本青年作家和富翁的女儿结婚。”
    这个所谓“无产阶级作家”极力颂扬日本的资本主义社会。据日本《读卖新闻》报道，肖洛霍夫二十四日在日本文艺家协会为他的六十一岁生日而举办的“祝寿”酒会上，“眼圈湿润，感慨不尽地说，日本太好了。我要知道这儿好，早就该来了。”他还在东京的电视广播中说他“爱日本的一切”。
    肖洛霍夫在日本到处游山逛水，吃喝玩乐，对日本人民反对美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争，丝毫不感兴趣。他到达日本的第二天，就对东京闹市银座大街和浅草的腐朽的资本主义社会，表示十分欣赏。据日本报刊报道，他无论走进哪家商店，总是摆出一副“大人物”的派头，说：“我有钱，你拿高级的东西给我”。连一家日本的资产阶级报刊《现代周刊》也认为他是“忘记了工人的苏联新贵族”。据这家周刊报道，接待肖洛霍夫的日本人士说：“看到肖洛霍夫一家在日本逗留期间的生活方式，都异口同声地说，怎么也想象不到是从共产主义国家来的人”。
