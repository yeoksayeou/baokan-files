    According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, 6th, Tanzanian newspaper *The Nationalist* published a commentary on the 6th, condemning the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for plotting subversive conspiracies in Asian and African countries, and calling on the people of Asian and African countries to remain vigilant against this.

    The newspaper warned that U.S. CIA agents usually infiltrate Asian and African countries under the guise of "Peace Corps," "travelers," "teachers," and "advisors" to carry out subversive activities.

    The newspaper pointed out that the imperialists "want us to open our doors for them to come in and engage in subversive activities, so that they can decide for us who will rule us and for whom we will serve."

    The newspaper also said, "In the former British colonies, that is, in the Commonwealth countries, the U.S. CIA, in close collusion with the infamous British MI6 intelligence network," is carrying out infiltration and subversion activities in these countries.

    谴责美中央情报局颠覆阴谋
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆六日电　坦桑尼亚报纸《民族主义者报》六日发表评论，谴责美国中央情报局在亚非国家策划颠覆阴谋，并号召亚非各国人民对此保持警惕。
    报纸警告说，美国中央情报局的特务通常是披着“和平队”、“旅行家”、“教师”和“顾问”的外衣渗入亚非国家进行颠覆活动的。
    报纸指出，帝国主义者“要我们敞开大门让他们进来搞颠覆活动，以便他们能够代我们决定谁来统治我们和为谁效劳。”
    报纸又说，“在英国前殖民地中，也就是在英联邦国家中，美国中央情报局在同臭名远扬的英国特务网军事情报第六处密切勾结下”，对这些国家进行渗透和颠覆活动。
