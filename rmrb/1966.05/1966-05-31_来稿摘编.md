    Excerpts from Submitted Articles
    Deng Tuo vigorously praised Zheng Banqiao for "being his own master in all aspects, not being a slave" and "blazing his own trail." This is telling us not to listen to the Party and Chairman Mao. This is wishful thinking! I, an orphan who lost my parents at a young age, deeply understand that without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we would have nothing. If it weren't for the Communist Party, I wouldn't even have my life, let alone go to university. In the old society, where demons reigned, countless orphans like me starved and froze to death! We must listen to the Party, and take Chairman Mao's words as the highest instruction for all our work, and carry the revolution through to the end. Only in this way can we forever "be our own masters," not be "slaves" of the landlord class, the bourgeoisie, and imperialism, and truly "blaze" a broad road leading to communism!
                    Zheng Chuande, Student of the Department of Law, Peking University
    On New Year's Day in 1961, the traitor Deng Tuo wrote a reactionary "New Year's Message," clamoring loudly to "take advantage of the good times, work together with one heart, persist in struggle, and never hesitate!" Shouting loudly about "raising the red flag high," and seeing "who is the pioneer," implying that as long as their gang "brothers" "work hard," "the people of our country" will "cheer in all four seas." Look, how arrogant Deng Tuo's arrogance is, he is simply "going crazy"! We want to question you, what do you mean by this? "Work together with one heart" shows that you have a plan, and now is the time to "work hard" and "do great things." "Persist in struggle" shows that you have been plotting for a long time, struggling for many years, and now it is time to "do great things" and "persist" to the end; "never hesitate," this is your clarion call to mobilize your "brothers" to "do great things" without hesitation.
    "Raising the red flag high" means that you want to raise the "red flag" high, shout Marxist-Leninist words loudly, and do counter-revolutionary deeds fiercely. How sinister and vicious! It truly makes old and new hatreds surge into our hearts together! You are thinking too beautifully! We can only settle accounts with you, and will never "cheer" for you. As for a small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, they would like to "cheer" for you, but unfortunately they have no chance. They can only sing a dirge for you now.

    邓拓极力吹捧郑板桥在“一切方面都要自作主人，不当奴才”，“自己踏出一条路来”。这是叫我们不要听党和毛主席的话。这是白日作梦！我这个从小失去父母的孤儿深切体会到，没有共产党和毛主席，就没有我们的一切，要不是共产党来了，我甚至连命也没有了，哪还能上大学念书。在那魔鬼当道的旧社会，象我这样的孤儿活活饿死、冻死的何止千万！我们要听党的话，要把毛主席话作为一切工作的最高指示，将革命进行到底。只有这样，才能永远“自作主人”，不当地主资产阶级和帝国主义的“奴才”，才能真正“踏出”一条通向共产主义的康庄大道来！

    一九六一年元旦，叛徒邓拓写了一篇反动的“元旦献辞”，高声狂叫什么要“趁良辰美景，同心戮力，坚持奋斗，切莫踌躇！”大叫什么“红旗高举”，什么看“谁是先驱”，暗示他们的黑帮“兄弟”只要“大干”，“我国人民”就会“四海欢呼”。看，邓拓的气焰多么嚣张，简直要“发疯”了！我们要质问你，你这是什么意思？“同心戮力”说明你们早有计划，现在是“戮力”“大干”的时候了，“坚持奋斗”说明你们蓄谋已久，奋斗多年，现在到了要“大干”，“坚持”到底的时候了；“切莫踌躇”，这是你策动你的“兄弟”“大干”，不要犹豫的号角。
    “红旗高举”，是说你们要把“红旗”举得高高的，马列主义的言词要喊得响响的，而反革命的勾当要干得狠狠的。多么阴险、毒辣！真使人旧恨新仇一起涌上心头！你们想得也太美了！我们只能跟你们算账，决不会向你们“欢呼”。至于一小撮地富反坏右呢，他们倒想向你们“欢呼”，可惜没有机会，他们现在只好向你们唱挽歌了。
