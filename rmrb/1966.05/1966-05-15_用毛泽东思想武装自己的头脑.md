*People's Liberation Army Daily* and *Guangming Daily* Editors' Note:

    The articles "Arming One's Mind with Mao Zedong Thought" written by comrade Zhuang Jiafu, a table tennis player, in 1960, and "Talking About the Philosophy of Selling Watermelons in Big Cities" written by comrade Zhou Xinli, manager of the Zhabei District Company of the Shanghai Fruit and Grocery Company, in 1965, are two excellent examples of the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. However, they were criticized by certain so-called "authorities" as typical examples of "vulgarization" and "pragmatism." We are publishing these two articles to ask everyone to read and think: On what standpoint do the so-called "authorities" who vehemently criticized these two articles stand in relation to Mao Zedong Thought, and in relation to workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's writings? What attitude do they adopt?

    Arming One's Mind with Mao Zedong Thought
    Zhuang Jiafu

    Since liberation, all aspects of the motherland have developed rapidly. If people's thinking cannot keep up with the development of the situation, it will inevitably lead to losses in work. In the past, due to my low level of thinking, unclear understanding of the development and changes of things, and working based on subjective ideas, I often encountered setbacks and made mistakes. After emphasizing theoretical study, I have gained certain achievements. However, persisting in learning is also difficult. First, there is no habit; second, it is difficult to understand, such as what is meant by "metaphysics." Sometimes, even after reading it two or three times, the meaning is still unclear. Some problems are not easy to understand and remember, and it feels boring and uninteresting, which is mainly because a reading habit has not been formed. Later, I alternated between reading novels and theoretical books, reading a section of a novel, then a section of a theoretical book. This energized me, and I gradually persisted, forming a reading habit. Now, I no longer need to read a section of a novel. I also combine reading more with thinking more and asking more, which makes it easier to understand, and my interest grows more and more. (Note: Cultivating interest and habit in studying theory should mainly rely on raising class consciousness.) However, to persist in learning, especially after exercising every day, when the body is fatigued, and sometimes having to participate in competitions continuously, if I don't seize the time, I will interrupt or relax. This requires overcoming difficulties and developing my subjective initiative. I often carry Chairman Mao's works with me, seizing all available time, reading a section before and after meetings and meals, or before going to bed at night. Facts have proven that this is entirely possible.

    While learning, I also connect it with my own work and thoughts, comparing my own position, viewpoints, thinking methods, and working methods, thereby raising ideological understanding and improving work. Before participating in the 25th World Table Tennis Championships last year, we organized the study of Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," which greatly broadened my horizons and improved my ability to use dialectical analysis. In the past, when we competed with foreigners, we always saw more of their advantages and fewer of our own, saw fewer of their shortcomings and more of our own, and could not comprehensively analyze, estimate, and correctly judge the situation. Therefore, we lacked confidence in the competition and were prone to tension. Due to viewing problems with mechanical, idealistic, and absolute viewpoints, I used to blindly believe in Hungary's Berczik and Sidó, and Czechoslovakia's Štipek, thinking they were formidable and difficult to deal with. But after studying and raising understanding, my thinking changed, and I recognized and believed that our straight-grip fast and powerful attacks and varied serves could defeat the opponent's spin, angled chops, and counter-attacks. Through actual contact, we achieved victory, and our understanding and confidence were further enhanced and consolidated, breaking down superstition.

    From Chairman Mao's teachings to army commanders, I realized that an athlete or coach must also be both wise and brave, having both revolutionary enthusiasm and a calm mind to analyze specific situations. In competition, one must "adopt tactics according to the opponent," and reckless actions are not acceptable. For example, if a long attack doesn't work, use a short ball; if a hard smash is unfavorable, change to a soft loop; and flexibly use chop-attack, loop-attack, serve-attack, diagonal and straight lines, and the middle line. Rong Guotuan's ability to win the men's singles title at the 25th World Table Tennis Championships was inseparable from implementing Chairman Mao's thought of being both wise and brave. I remember in one match, Rong Guotuan was in a losing position of one to two (best of five games), and in the fourth game, he was behind five to ten. It seemed that Rong Guotuan might be eliminated. At that time, we analyzed the situation and found that Rong's fierce power drives had not only been closely defended and returned by opponents far from the table but also frequently resulted in self-inflicted errors. Later, he switched to a more steady attack, forcing the opponent to cover both front and back, unable to cope and losing points repeatedly until defeat. When Rong Guotuan competed with Sidó for the world championship, the importance of correct thinking methods was even more evident. Before this match, Rong and Sidó had each won and lost, just as Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "In a war between two armies, one wins and the other loses; the reason for victory or defeat always lies in the internal causes," "In war, offense and defense, advance and retreat, victory and defeat, are all contradictory phenomena." Yes, sports competition itself is contradictory movement. Table tennis is the same; if you want to attack, the opponent will not let you attack, but will return the ball to a place where your counterattack is awkward. Constantly discovering contradictions and resolving contradictions is the process for athletes to strive for victory. Therefore, one must have a strong will, not be afraid, and have perseverance no matter what, persisting to the end. This kind of inspiration gave Rong Guotuan wisdom and courage, found the main contradiction in the match with Sidó, and adopted a solution to this contradiction. As a result, he achieved victory.

    In on-the-spot guidance in world competitions, although there have been some gains, there are still many shortcomings. After returning to China, I re-studied Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War." Chairman Mao said: "Experienced soldiers, if they are modest and learn, and they are familiar with the temperament of their own troops (commanders, fighters, weapons, supplies, etc. and their totality), and also familiar with the temperament of the enemy's troops (similarly, commanders, fighters, weapons, supplies, etc. and their totality), and familiar with all other conditions related to the war such as politics, economy, geography, climate, etc., then such soldiers are more likely to be sure and more likely to win when guiding the war or combat. This is the result of recognizing the situation of both the enemy and ourselves over a long period of time, finding the law of action, and resolving the contradiction between the subjective and the objective." Chairman Mao's teachings made me pay more attention to grasping the changes in the players' ideological situation during on-the-spot guidance, and pay attention to how to grasp the timing of the battle, and specifically combine the spirit of Chairman Mao's remarks with table tennis competitions, such as always paying attention to the reasons for changes in the competition situation, telling the players in time, and paying attention to the way to speak to the players. Talk more about the advantages, boost the morale of our own players. Usually pay attention to understanding the temperament of the players, and in what circumstances will produce what bad emotions, such as fear, soft hands; before the game, explain to the athletes the tactical ideas to be adopted, and so on.

    When the Chinese Table Tennis B Team competed in Hungary, Li Furong's battle against Yugoslav veteran Haringzo was a tough fight. Haringzo is the ninth-ranked outstanding table tennis player in the world this year. His chop shots have strong spin, he uses spin and no-spin very well, and can coordinate with sudden counterattacks. Li Furong happens to be relatively poor at smashing balls with strong spin. I didn't tell Li Furong how formidable the opponent was beforehand, because as long as I show a lack of confidence at this time, it would affect Li Furong's mood. The battle continued fiercely until the decisive fifth game. Li Furong was behind 20 to 21. At that time, I was really a little nervous, because if Li Furong lost another point, he would be eliminated. At this time, I noticed that the opponent was closely watching Li Furong's attack on his left. I thought about shouting "Li Furong, don't attack the left!" But I immediately thought that this would shake Li Furong's confidence, so I changed my tone and said to Li Furong: "The opponent is afraid of you attacking the left, and has strictly guarded it, you attack his right, and serve from the right corner." Sure enough, Li Furong was full of confidence, serving and attacking continuously, and won the final victory with 23 to 21. The Chinese Table Tennis B Team paid special attention to learning and improving in the competition during its visit to Europe, and therefore also learned some ways to deal with European players.

    After studying for this period of time, I deeply realized that correct theory is not limited by time and is "universally applicable." Chairman Mao's "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" was published as early as the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1936). However, the universal truths in the book can be fully used to guide table tennis competitions today, because it is materialist dialectics. The tremendous guiding role of Mao Zedong Thought in our work fully proves the importance and urgency of a revolutionary studying Chairman Mao's works. In the future, I will study Chairman Mao's works more vigorously and use Chairman Mao's thought to better arm my mind, so as to obtain endless strength.

### 用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑
庄家富

专栏：

    《解放军报》《光明日报》编者按：
    乒乓球运动员庄家富同志一九六○年写的《用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑》，上海市果品杂货公司闸北区公司经理周信礼同志一九六五年写的《谈谈大城市卖西瓜的哲学问题》，是活学活用毛泽东思想的两篇好文章。但是，竟被某些所谓“权威”指责为“庸俗化”、“实用主义”的典型。我们把这两篇文章发表出来，请大家读一读，想一想：大骂这两篇文章的所谓“权威”，对待毛泽东思想，对待工农兵学习毛主席著作，究竟是站在什么立场？究竟是采取什么态度？
    用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑
    庄家富
    解放几年来，祖国各方面都飞跃地发展，人的思想如果跟不上形势发展，必然会给工作带来损失。过去在工作中，由于自己思想水平低，对事物的发展和变化认识不清，凭主观去干，往往碰了钉子，出了差错。重视理论学习后，已有一定收获。但坚持学习也是有困难的。首先是没有习惯，其次是难懂，比如什么叫“形而上学”。有时连看两三遍，意思还是不明白。有些问题不容易理解和记忆，会感到枯燥乏味，兴趣下降，这主要是没有养成读书习惯。后来我把小说和理论书交替看，看一段小说，看一段理论书。这样一来就提神了，慢慢地坚持下来，养成了读书习惯。现在就不必再看一段小说了。我还把多看和多想、多问结合起来，这样就容易体会，兴趣也就越来越大。（注：培养学习理论的兴趣和习惯，主要应靠提高阶级觉悟）但是，要坚持学习，尤其是每天锻炼之后，身体疲劳，有时又要连续参加比赛，如果不抓紧时间，就会中断或放松。这就要克服困难，发扬自己的主观能动性。我经常带着毛主席著作，抓紧一切空隙时间，在开会和吃饭前后，或在晚上睡觉前看一段。事实证明，这样做是完全可以的。
    一面学习，一面联系自己的工作和思想，对照自己的立场、观点、思想方法和工作方法，从而提高思想认识，改进工作。去年参加第二十五届世界乒乓球比赛前，我们组织学习了毛主席的《中国革命战争的战略问题》，使我大开眼界，提高了运用辩证法的分析能力。过去，我们同外国人比赛，总看到对方优点多，自己优点少，看到对方缺点少，自己缺点多，不能全面分析、估计和正确判断情况。因此，对比赛缺乏信心，容易紧张。由于以机械、唯心、绝对的观点看问题，过去我对匈牙利的别尔切克、西多，捷克斯洛伐克的斯蒂佩克，都很迷信，认为他们厉害，难以应付。但经过学习，提高认识后，思想有了转变，认清和相信了我们的直拍快速有力的进攻和变化多端的发球，可以战胜对方的旋转、逼角削球和反攻。通过实际接触，我们取得了胜利，认识和信心更加提高了，巩固了，破除了迷信。
    从毛主席对军队指挥员的教导中，我认识到，一个运动员或教练员也必须智勇双全，既有革命的干劲，也要有分析具体情况的冷静头脑，比赛中要“看对象讲战术”，蛮干是不行的。比如，长攻不死，放短球，硬抽不利，改软拉；搓攻、拉攻、发球抢攻、斜直和中间线路等灵活运用。容国团能获得第二十五届世界乒乓球赛男子单打冠军，是与贯彻毛主席智勇双全的思想分不开的。记得容国团在一场比赛中，处在一比二失利地位（五局三胜制），第四局又居于五比十劣势下，眼看容国团可能被淘汰下来。当时我们分析了情况，发现容凶猛的大板抽击不但已被远离球台的对手严密防守顶回，而且自己频频自杀失误。后来改用了抢攻较稳健的打法，迫使对方前后照顾，不及应付而连连失分，直至败北。当容国团与西多争夺世界冠军时，更显示出正确思想方法的重要性。在这场比赛之前，容与西多各有胜负，正如毛主席在《矛盾论》中说的：“两军相争，一胜一败，所以胜败，皆决于内因”，“战争中的攻守，进退，胜败，都是矛盾着的现象”。是的，运动竞赛本身就是矛盾运动。乒乓球也一样，你要攻，对方就是不给你攻，把球打回到你反击别扭的地方去。不断发现矛盾和解决矛盾，就是运动员争取胜利的过程。因此必须有坚强的意志，不要怕，不论什么时候都要有毅力，坚持到底。这样的启发给了容国团智慧和勇气，找出了同西多比赛的主要矛盾所在，并采取了解决这个矛盾的办法。结果得到了胜利。
    在世界比赛临场指导中，虽然有一些收获，但缺点仍不少。回国后，重新学习毛主席的《中国革命战争的战略问题》。毛主席说：“经验多的军人，假使他是虚心学习的，他摸熟了自己的部队（指挥员、战斗员、武器、给养等等及其总体）的脾气，又摸熟了敌人的部队（同样，指挥员、战斗员、武器、给养等等及其总体）的脾气，摸熟了一切和战争有关的其他的条件如政治、经济、地理、气候等等，这样的军人指导战争或作战，就比较地有把握，比较地能打胜仗。这是在长时间内认识了敌我双方的情况，找出了行动的规律，解决了主观和客观的矛盾的结果。”毛主席的教导使我在临场指导时，更注意掌握队员的思想情况的变化，注意如何掌握战机，把毛主席这番话的精神和乒乓球比赛具体地结合起来，如时刻注意比赛局势发生变化的原因，及时告诉队员，而且注意用什么方式给队员讲话。多讲优点，长自己队员的志气。平时注意摸透队员的脾气，在什么情况下会产生什么不良情绪，如害怕、手软；临赛前，给运动员讲清楚准备采用的战术思想，等等。
    中国乒乓球乙队在匈牙利比赛时，李富荣对南斯拉夫老将哈林格佐一战，是一场艰苦战斗。哈林格佐是今年世界乒乓球优秀选手第九名。他的削球旋转力很强，运用转与不转也很好，并能配合突然性反击。小李恰恰抽杀较转的球是较差的。事前我不对小李说对手如何厉害的话，因为这时只要我表现信心不足，就会影响小李的情绪。战斗一直激烈地进行到决胜的第五局。小李以二十比二十一落后。当时我心里也实在有点紧张，因为再失一球小李就被淘汰。这时发觉对方密切注意了小李进攻他的左路。我想大声叫“小李不要攻左路！”但立刻想到这样会动摇小李的信心，就改变语气对小李说：“对手怕你攻左路，已经严防了，你攻他右路，发球也从右角发。”果然小李充满信心，一口气连续发球抢攻，以二十三比二十一取得最后胜利。中国乒乓球乙队到欧洲访问比赛，特别注意了在比赛中学习和提高，因而也摸到一些对付欧洲选手的办法。
    经过这段时间的学习，我深深体会到：正确的理论是不受时间限制“放之四海而皆准”的。毛主席的《中国革命战争的战略问题》，早在抗日战争初期（一九三六年）就问世了。但书中的普遍真理今天完全可以用来指导乒乓球比赛，因为它是唯物辩证的。毛泽东思想对我们工作所起的巨大指导作用，完全证明了一个革命者学习毛主席著作的重要性和迫切性。今后，我要更加奋发努力学习毛主席著作，用毛主席的思想更好地武装自己的头脑，从而获得无穷无尽的力量。
