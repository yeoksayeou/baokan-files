The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Hubei Province and Wuhan City have taken active action to open fire on the black gang headed by Deng Tuo.

Workers at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's iron smelting plant held a discussion in front of the furnace. They angrily said: Deng Tuo's vicious attacks on the Party and Chairman Mao, on the General Line and the Great Leap Forward, are in tune with the domestic and foreign class enemies. Wasn't Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation built from scratch, from nothing to something, from small to large, the product of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward? Is this "blowing one's own trumpet" and "talking nonsense"? Workers at Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant cited the rapid construction of this factory and the mass production of many heavy machine tools as an example, employees of the Tramway Company cited the development of public transportation in this city as an example, and medical workers cited the achievements of reattaching severed hands and treating large-area burns as examples, and denounced Deng Tuo's slander against the Party. They unanimously questioned Deng Tuo: "Which of our country's great achievements is not the result of the Party's leadership and the product of the General Line and the Great Leap Forward? Deng Tuo, can you deny these iron-clad facts?"

Many employees refuted Deng Tuo's slander that the Party does not believe in the masses and does not care about the masses with their personal experiences. At a discussion meeting held by Factory 7435, many workers and technical personnel presented the results of technological innovations in their factory, saying: "This is the result of the Party relying on the masses, believing in the masses, and implementing the combination of leadership, workers, and technical personnel. Deng Tuo spreads these black words, which only shows that he has a black heart." Dragon Wenzhong, a worker engineer and technological innovator from the Municipal Construction Bureau, denounced Deng Tuo at a workers' discussion meeting held at Jianghan Workers' Cultural Palace: "The construction system was completely manual labor in the past. The Party has always cared for us workers and valued technological innovation. In less than ten years, many of our construction sites have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. Isn't this the product of the Great Leap Forward? Isn't this the result of the Party's great concern for us workers?" Old salesperson Xiong Boshen from the Central Department Store said: "The Party and Chairman Mao have always taught us to rely on the masses, go deep into the masses, and care about the masses. We have always done this under the leadership of the Party. Deng Tuo says the Party does not believe in the masses and does not care about the masses, which is a vicious attack."

In many discussion meetings and articles, everyone expressed great indignation at the fact that *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily* were using false criticism to protect, acting as anti-Party tools for Deng Tuo and his gang.

In discussions and articles, everyone talked about how we must never forget class struggle. Worker Guo Baolong from Hanyang Rolling Mill said: "This is a serious class struggle, a long-term, tortuous, and sharp struggle. If we defeat today's Deng Tuo and Wu Han, there will be tomorrow's Deng Tuo and Wu Han. We must never be complacent and must never forget class struggle." Worker Liu Yongcai from Jianghan No. 1 Mill said: "The enemy who does not use guns but uses the 'red flag' to oppose the red flag is therefore more treacherous. We must peel off their 'red skin' to see their black hearts."

    高举红旗  打垮黑帮
    不拿枪的敌人打着“红旗”反红旗，因此他们更加阴险
    武汉
    湖北省和武汉市广大工农兵积极行动起来，向以邓拓为首的资产阶级黑帮开火。
    武钢炼铁厂工人在炉前举行座谈。他们愤怒地说：邓拓那样恶毒地攻击党和毛主席，攻击总路线和大跃进，和国内外阶级敌人是一个调子。我们武钢平地起家，从无到有，从小到大，这不是总路线、大跃进的产物吗？这是“吹牛皮”、“说空话”吗？武汉重型机床厂的工人在座谈会上举出这个厂迅速建成、成批生产很多重型机床为例，电车公司的职工以本市公用交通事业的发展为例，医务工作者举出断手再植、治愈大面积烧伤等成果为例，痛斥邓拓对党的污蔑。他们一致质问邓拓：“我们祖国伟大的成就那一件不是党领导的结果和总路线、大跃进的产物？邓拓，这些铁的事实，你能否认吗？”
    许多职工以亲身体验，驳斥了邓拓诬蔑我们党不相信群众、不关心群众的黑话。七四三五工厂举行的座谈会上，许多工人、技术人员举出他们工厂技术革新的成果，说：“这都是党依靠群众，相信群众，实行领导、工人和技术人员三结合的结果。邓拓散布这些黑话，只能说明他长的是一颗黑心。”市建工局工人工程师、技术革新闯将龙文忠在江汉工人文化宫举行的职工座谈会上，痛斥邓拓说：“建筑系统过去完全是手工劳动，党一贯关心我们工人，重视技术革新，不到十年，现在在我们系统的许多工地基本上实现了机械化和半机械化。这难道不是大跃进的产物，难道不是党十分关心我们工人的结果吗？”市中心百货商店的老营业员熊波臣说：“党和毛主席一贯教导我们要依靠群众，深入群众，关心群众，我们在党的领导下，也一贯这样做，邓拓说党不相信群众，不关心群众，这完全是恶毒的攻击。”
    在许多座谈会上和文章中，大家对《前线》、《北京日报》假批判，真掩护，充当邓拓一伙人的反党工具，表示极大愤慨。
    在座谈和文章中大家谈到千万不能忘记阶级斗争。汉阳轧钢厂工人郭宝龙说：“这是一场严重的阶级斗争，这场斗争是长期的、曲折的、尖锐的。斗倒了今天的邓拓、吴晗，还会有明天的邓拓、吴晗，我们绝不能麻痹，永远不忘阶级斗争。”江汉一米厂的工人刘永才说：“不拿枪的敌人打着‘红旗’反红旗，因此他们更加阴险，我们一定要剥掉他们的‘红皮’看黑心。”
