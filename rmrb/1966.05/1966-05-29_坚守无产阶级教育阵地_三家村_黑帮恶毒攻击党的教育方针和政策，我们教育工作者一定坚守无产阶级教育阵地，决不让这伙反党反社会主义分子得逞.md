    Firmly Defend the Proletarian Education Position
    The "Three-Family Village" Black Gang Viciously Attacks the Party's Education Guidelines and Policies; We Education Workers Must Firmly Defend the Proletarian Education Position, and Absolutely Not Allow This Gang of Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Elements to Succeed
    Li Jinglan, Representative of the National People's Congress and Teacher at Lanzhou Workers' Children's Primary School
    The "Three-Family Village" anti-Party black gang, headed by Deng Tuo, viciously attacks our great Party, great leader, and slanders the General Line. They make a big fuss, viciously attacking the Party's education guidelines and policies, attempting to use the bourgeois education line to poison the successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We education workers resolutely disagree.
    Imperialism places its hopes on the "peaceful evolution" of our third and fourth generations, and Deng Tuo and his ilk help and serve them, even attempting to organize forces for the restoration of capitalism in China. They vigorously tout the bourgeois theory of human nature and the educational methods of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes. They say things like "regarding Mencius's opinion that 'human beings are inherently good,' we should basically agree," promoting things like "the methods of the old opera schools are in line with the principles of education," and telling us to "teach according to aptitude and employ according to aptitude," and so on. This is clearly opposing the use of a class perspective to analyze and educate the younger generation, so that they can effortlessly drag the younger generation into their black shop and turn them into tools for capitalist restoration. From this, it is not difficult to see that Deng Tuo and his ilk are doing their utmost to advocate the abolition of the Party's education guidelines and the class line. Our education guidelines should enable those receiving education to develop in terms of morality, intellect, and physical education, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. But Deng Tuo and his ilk do the opposite, advocating "learning the spirit of Wang Chong, studying diligently," attempting to abolish moral and physical education. This means not emphasizing politics, not putting Mao Zedong Thought in command, intellect first, detachment from the masses, and detachment from labor. Isn't this exactly the same old tune as the bourgeoisie shouting about "technology is supreme," "studying is first," and "having technology is a golden rice bowl"? Isn't this exactly the same as modern revisionism, wanting to cultivate a group of highly paid people who are divorced from the people? In reality, they want us to train bourgeois successors.
      The "Three-Family Village" black gang also desperately instills in young people things like "the combination of self-study and family tradition," how to become a "famous scholar" through "hard study," and how to "lay the foundation by 'reading all the materials,'" saying that "since ancient times, there have been countless famous scholars who have succeeded through self-study." They also say, "The destination is still far away!" What destination? It is "to know that to become an 'expert,' it is absolutely not enough to rely on one article, you have to put in tremendous hard work." (Preface to the first collection of children's writings in Beijing, *Today I Feed Chickens* - Wu Han) They also said: "As long as the children do not slacken their efforts, I am very optimistic that in a few years, a group of writers, poets, painters, botanists and other experts will emerge from this group of authors, and our generation will have better successors." (Preface to the second collection of children's writings in Beijing, *Me and Little Mischief* - Wu Han) How vicious! They want the successors to our revolutionary cause to break away from the three great revolutionary movements, become bourgeois "experts," take over the "class" of Deng Tuo and Wu Han, and become tools for capitalist restoration. Their words are extremely sweet, but their hearts are extremely poisonous.
    Deng Tuo and his ilk also released a lot of nonsense about how "the quality of teaching methods is of great importance to the quality of teaching," saying that our "daily inspections are even fewer," that "teachers should always inspect," and that "our teachers' demands on students should seem to be stricter than Sima Guang, and should never be inferior to him," and so on. These black words of Deng Tuo are meant to make us abandon politics and abandon revolution. So-called wanting us to be "stricter" than Sima Guang in our demands on students, isn't its intention to use fascist and feudal methods to treat children?
    Deng Tuo black gang, we will never be fooled by you. Under the leadership of the Party, we have achieved great success because we have implemented the Party's education policy. Your calculations are wrong. We education workers will never allow the conspiracy of Deng Tuo and his anti-Party, anti-socialist gang to succeed. We must emphasize politics even more, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, regard Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instruction for all work, firmly defend the proletarian education position, and defend socialism. Resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, overthrow all monsters and demons, and carry the socialist cultural revolution through to the end.

    坚守无产阶级教育阵地
    “三家村”黑帮恶毒攻击党的教育方针和政策，我们教育工作者一定坚守无产阶级教育阵地，决不让这伙反党反社会主义分子得逞
    全国人民代表大会代表兰州职工子弟小学教师  李景兰
    以邓拓为首的“三家村”反党黑帮，恶毒攻击我们伟大的党、伟大的领袖，污蔑总路线。他们大作文章，恶毒攻击党的教育方针和政策，企图用资产阶级的教育路线，毒害无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们教育工作者坚决不答应。
    帝国主义把希望寄托在我们第三代、第四代的“和平演变”上，邓拓之流也就给帮忙、效劳，还企图为资本主义在中国复辟组织力量。他们大肆吹捧资产阶级人性论和资产阶级、封建阶级的教育方法。说什么“对于孟子说的‘人生皆有善性’的意见却应该表示基本上赞同”，鼓吹什么“旧科班的这一套方法是符合于教育学原理的”，要我们“量才而教之，量才而用之”等等。这明明是反对用阶级观点去分析和教育青少年一代，以便让他们不费气力地把青少年一代拉入黑店，充当资本主义复辟的工具。从这里不难看出，邓拓之流这样极力鼓吹，就是要我们取消党的教育方针，取消阶级路线。我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。可是邓拓之流却恰恰相反，提倡
  “学习王充的精神，勤苦读书”，企图取消德育、体育。这也就是不要突出政治，不要毛泽东思想挂帅，智育第一，脱离群众，脱离劳动。这不正是资产阶级喊的什么“技术至上”、“读书第一”、“有技术就是金饭碗”的滥调吗？这不正是要象现代修正主义一样，要培养一批脱离人民的高薪阶层吗？揭穿了，就是要我们培养资产阶级接班人。
      “三家村”黑帮还极力向青少年灌输什么“自学和家传相结合的途径”，什么用“苦读”成为“著名的学者”，什么“读尽一切资料‘来’打基础”，“古来不知有多少著名的学者都是自学成功的。”他们还说什么“到达目的地还远着呢！”什么目的？就是“要知道成一个‘家’，光靠一篇文章是绝对不行的，要付出巨大的艰苦的努力”。（北京市少年儿童习作选第一集《今天我喂鸡》序——吴晗）还说：“只要小朋友们不放松努力，我很乐观，不用多少年，将会从这批作者中涌现出成群的作家、诗人、画家、植物学家和其它方面的专家，我们这一代就有了更好的接班人”。（北京市少年儿童习作选第二集《我和小淘气》序——吴晗）这多恶毒啊！要我们革命事业的接班人脱离三大革命运动，成为资产阶级的“家”，接邓拓、吴晗之流的“班”，当资本主义复辟的工具。真是其言极甜，其心极毒。
    邓拓之流还大肆放出什么“教授法的好坏对教学质量关系重大”，说什么我们“日常的考察更少”，“教师总应该经常考察”，还说“我们的教师对学生的要求似乎应该比司马光更严格一些，而决不应比他还不如”等等。邓拓这些黑话，是要我们脱离政治，脱离革命，所谓要我们对学生的要求比司马光“更严格一些”，其用意不是要我们用法西斯的、封建的办法来对待少年儿童吗？
    邓拓黑帮，我们决不会上你们的当。在党的领导下，我们因为贯彻了党的教育方针，才取得了伟大成绩。你们的算盘打错了。我们教育工作者决不让邓拓一伙反党反社会主义分子的阴谋得逞，一定要更加突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示，坚守无产阶级教育阵地，保卫社会主义。坚决彻底搞掉反党反社会主义的黑线，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底。
