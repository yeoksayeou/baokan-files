    How I Achieved Over a Decade Without Producing Defective Products
    Yu Yongkang, Turner at Shanghai Dalong Machinery Factory

    Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: Specifically analyzing specific situations is the living soul of Marxism-Leninism. Only by specifically analyzing the particularity of contradictions in things can we possibly understand the essence of things and find methods for resolving contradictions.

    Currently, one of the characteristics of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is that they are good at starting from the characteristics of their own work, specifically analyzing specific situations, grasping the dialectics of the development of things themselves, and thereby improving their work. The article by veteran worker Yu Yongkang and several articles discussing dialectics in blast furnaces published in today's newspaper are good examples. Comrade Yu Yongkang first correctly resolved the relationship between people and products, understood for whom and why he was working, and connected his daily work with the issue of serving the revolution; on this basis, he correctly analyzed the various special contradictions existing in processing operations and correctly resolved them, which enabled him to achieve over a decade without producing defective products. Their experiences and insights are worth reading.

    I am a lathe worker at the Dalong Machinery Factory in Shanghai, and I've been dealing with hand cranks for over a decade. Since our factory became a joint state-private enterprise in 1954, I haven't produced any defective products in my work and have exceeded the state plan. Some comrades have asked me, why haven't you produced defective products in over a decade? In the past, I couldn't explain it clearly either. Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," and looking back at my own work, I understand it a bit better. Below, I'll talk about my experiences of not producing defective products for over a decade.

          Correctly Handling the Relationship Between People and Products

    I entered the Dalong Factory at the age of fifteen, and it's been twenty-four years now. Over these twenty-four years, the relationship between me and the products has changed greatly. Now, my relationship with the products is different from the past, and my attitude towards the products is also different.

    Before liberation, I ran to the Dalong Factory as a child laborer because my family was poor. I produced products simply to earn a living. Whether the products were good or bad wasn't up to us workers. Some castings in the factory had sand holes so large that even a child's fist could fit inside, but the boss still said they were good to use. In the boss's eyes, there was no such thing as "quality" or "defective products"; making money was his only "standard."

    In the early days of liberation, I thought: Now that we are liberated, it won't hurt to improve my life, and I can get a higher grade and a bigger salary in the future. I regarded the quality of the products as my own "capital" issue, the "face" issue of the master workers. Therefore, in production, I only sought "stability," dared not take on difficulties, dared not shoulder heavy burdens, and although I didn't produce any defective products, the quality couldn't be considered outstanding.

    In 1954, our factory implemented joint state-private ownership. After that, the factory's production tasks underwent great changes, from producing textile machine parts to manufacturing metallurgical equipment and chemical fertilizer equipment, etc. The precision requirements for these products were relatively high. Some originally relied on imports, but now we had to rely on ourselves to make them, and some even had to be exported to support other countries. Therefore, whether we could do it well was not a matter of personal face, but a matter of the Chinese workers' ambition, a matter of winning honor for the revolutionary people. Whenever I thought of this, I was full of energy, dared to face difficulties, and dared to shoulder heavy burdens. For example, the crankshaft on the high-pressure water pump had very high requirements for parallelism and ellipticity. At first, I couldn't do it well no matter how I tried. I thought that I was careful in the operation, and I had checked all the places where problems might occur, but the product was still a second-class product. I was really a bit discouraged. Later, I thought that product upgrading was a matter of catching up with foreign countries. The United States imperialists have high-pressure water pumps, and the revisionists also have them. If they can produce first-class ones, why can we only produce second-class ones? I was really not convinced. Therefore, I adopted the "three-in-one" method to find the reasons and found that the rigidity of the machine tool itself was not enough, and the faceplate was somewhat deformed. With the help of relevant departments, the headstock, faceplate, and tailstock on the machine tool were modified to increase rigidity, the product quality was upgraded, and the output was also increased by more than half. This incident shows that: to do a good job in production and make good products, we must first see that the workers are the masters of the products, and we must let the products express the revolutionary ambition of our workers.

      Promote the Transformation of Things to Achieve Revolutionary Goals

    Products must be processed using tools. The quality of the product is related to the precision of the machine tool equipment and the accuracy of the tools and gauges to a certain extent. But good and bad conditions are relative, and they transform into each other under certain conditions. Even the best machine tool still has errors; the errors of two machine tools are certainly different, and even the errors of the same machine tool are different at the same period due to different products being processed (different lengths, weights, and geometric shapes of the products). If we blindly rely on the "precision" of the machine tool and our thinking is not good enough, we will still have problems even if we use the most precise machine tool to process products.

    Based on these situations, whenever I use a machine tool, whether it is precise or "old," I always first familiarize myself with its temperament and find out its errors; even with machine tools that I am familiar with, I always try it out first each time I change the product to see how the machine tool error is. Micrometers are precision measuring tools, but they also have inaccuracies. Therefore, when I pick up a micrometer, I must first find out its error, and even micrometers that I use frequently, I must check to see if they have shifted after using them for a while. Because it is easy to be negligent and have problems when the "conditions are good," I require myself in this way: treat precision machine tools as "old" machine tools; treat old products as new products; treat "easy" work as "difficult" work; if the comrade on the shift says "no problem," I check as if there "is a problem." I think that: it is better to pay attention to "ten thousand" than to have "one in ten thousand" occur; the better the conditions, the more we must think from the unfavorable aspects, so that we can be prepared and truly utilize the good conditions.

      "Poor conditions" will certainly also produce defective products. But don't just give up because the conditions are poor. There are also favorable places in unfavorable situations. Because it is difficult to do, we pay attention in our thinking, which is a favorable condition in terms of spirit; because there is still a certain "precision" in the imprecision, this is a material condition. Once, I was processing a nut eye on a three-hundred-ton press drill. This eye was nine hundred and ten millimeters long, and the processing error could not exceed four threads, but the machine tool used for processing had concavity and convexity, and the error was six threads. It seemed that the precision of the machine tool was not enough, but as long as we found a way to avoid these six threads of error, the "old" machine tool could still produce good work. Therefore, I installed a dial indicator on the tool holder to control the accuracy of the product. When cutting, I kept my eyes wide open so that the error would not escape. The products processed in this way were all qualified.

    Finding unfavorable factors under favorable conditions and finding favorable factors under unfavorable conditions, I think that this is in line with the revolutionary spirit of dialectics, and only then can we "promote the transformation of things to achieve revolutionary goals."

        Make the Spirit of the General Line Blossom on Products

    To make good products, time is also an important condition. But it is not to say that only slow work can produce fine work. Why is "slow work" "slow"? Some are due to insufficient enthusiasm, and they are slow in places where they shouldn't be slow; some are because they haven't found the rules and don't do it the right way. If the enthusiasm is sufficient and the method is correct, "fast work" can completely produce "fine work." Once, when we were processing parts for large refrigeration machines, according to the drawings, there were only two processes. The processing time was two hundred and thirty minutes per piece. Some comrades had done it in the past, but it was actually impossible to do, and they were always behind schedule, and sometimes there were defective products. It was really a headache to encounter this kind of "awkward work." At first, some comrades suggested that quality would not be guaranteed without adding a process. Later, they thought: Adding a process would take more time. If we didn't add a process and still guaranteed quality, then it would be more, faster, better, and more economical. Therefore, we specifically analyzed the characteristics of the product and found a way to do it well with one process. With the leadership's approval, we did it, and not only was the quality qualified, but the output was also increased by more than half. From practice, I deeply realized that to solve the contradiction between more, faster, better, and more economical, we must first adhere to the spirit of the General Line, have sufficient enthusiasm in everything we do, strive for the upstream; at the same time, we must also start from the actual situation of the product, thoroughly understand the characteristics of the product, take comprehensive measures, and seek truly more, faster, better, and more economical, so that the spirit of the General Line can blossom on the products.

    Thoroughly understanding the characteristics of the product means "making specific analysis of specific things." Different products processed on different machine tools certainly have different processing methods; the same product processed on the same machine tool also has different processing methods; in various different processing methods, we must compare their advantages and disadvantages, and find a method from this that is the most reliable in quality and the most efficient. For example, in March 1965, I made the guide plate on the mud pump. This is an old product that has been made since 1958. The production quota has gradually been shortened from two workers making one pair to one worker making one pair. And this time, because it was needed for assembly, the workshop wanted me to make two pairs per worker. After receiving the task, I thought that there was no use in being anxious. It was still necessary to analyze the characteristics of the product to solve the processing problem of the product. The characteristic of this product is that it is processed by joining two semicircles together, and there is a gap in the middle. The knife is easy to break when cutting quickly, which is an unfavorable factor, so some people think that this kind of work cannot be done quickly. However, processing two things together is intermittent cutting, and the heat on the knife is easy to dissipate, which determines that the cutting speed can be increased and the feed rate can be increased, which is a favorable factor. However, I was not clear at this time how much the unfavorable factors and favorable factors played in the product. So I chose a knife for testing. In order to avoid breaking the knife, I changed the angle of the knife first; then I gradually increased the cutting speed from twenty revolutions to sixty revolutions; and then I gradually increased the feed rate from thirty-four threads to sixty threads. The knife did not break, the quality was also very good, and three pairs were made in one shift, completing the production plan ahead of schedule.

              Strive for Collective Honor

    In the high tide of competition, it is also easy to produce defective products. At this time, you make a few, I make a few, you chase me, and it is easy to only seek output. Whether we can adhere to quality first in the competition depends on whether we can give priority to the gains and losses of the country and take personal gains and losses lightly. Once, the young worker who worked with me on the shift created new achievements in production and did it faster than me. Before I even entered the workshop that day, some comrades said to me: "Today, it depends on Yongkang!" When I heard this, I asked myself: Am I unconvinced, or do I admit that I am behind and learn with an open mind? I thought: In the great plan of construction, quality is the first priority. I cannot put personal honor above the interests of the country. No matter whether I can catch up with the output today, the principle of quality first must be adhered to. I also thought that there must be a reason and strength for others to be fast. My slowness is a weakness, but I also have my strengths. If I learn the strengths of others and add them to my strengths, the sum of the two strengths will always be stronger than the strengths of either party. That day, I learned from the comrades on the shift, and I not only exceeded the output of the comrades on the shift, but the quality was also very good.

    In the activities of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, we must strive for what we can strive for, and we should not try to strive for what we cannot strive for temporarily, but create conditions to strive for. For example, sometimes the production task is more urgent, and the leader transfers me to do it. Some comrades jokingly say: "Now, it depends on Yongkang!" In the first two days, I won't strive for it. Because I just got the product and I am not familiar with the machine tool, I would rather do it slower than others than rush to strive for it. I think that rushing is also irresponsible to the country; therefore, we must gradually grasp the objective laws in the process of striving, so that the product can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical.

            Resolved to Be Two "Students"

    The fundamental reason why I have not produced defective products for more than ten years is the education of the Party and the help of the masses.

    For more than ten years, the Party has cultivated and educated me, so that I understand why people live? And why do they work? I have only been reading Chairman Mao's books for the past two years. I found that the fundamental revolutionary principles that the Party usually teaches me are clearly written in Chairman Mao's books. To better understand revolutionary principles, I must study Chairman Mao's books well and listen directly to Chairman Mao's teachings. At the beginning, I read "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Combat Liberalism." I further understood that to be a revolutionary worker, we must have a loyal and courageous heart, a spirit of moving mountains, a set of skills of striving for perfection, and a spirit of self-criticism. These teachings have all guided me to transform my thinking and do a good job in production. In 1965, I also studied the philosophical works "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" I understood that: Marxist philosophy is the most powerful weapon for us to understand the world and transform the world. I also made up my mind to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and never let it go. We must practice excellent skills and be meticulous.

    I haven't produced defective products for more than ten years, thanks to the help of my comrades. There are many veteran workers in our workshop. Some of the products that I am not sure about are solved with their help. Their successful experiences help me, and the lessons of producing defective products also inspire me. Someone said: "If you want to learn, you should learn from the advanced, why learn from defective products?" I think that: Sometimes it is not easy to see the experience in successful things; things that have failed can instead find vivid lessons. Accepting lessons also becomes experience.

    My time studying Chairman Mao's works is still very short, and I haven't done my work well enough. But, I have the confidence to learn well and do well. My determination and method are: be a good student of Chairman Mao and be a primary school student of the masses. (Compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions)

    我是怎样做到十几年不出废品的
    上海大隆机器厂车工　郁永康
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：具体地分析具体情况，是马克思列宁主义的活的灵魂。只有具体地分析事物矛盾的特殊性，才有可能认识事物的本质，找到解决矛盾的方法。
    目前，广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的特点之一，就是他们善于从本身工作的特点出发，具体地分析具体情况，掌握事物发展本身的辩证法，从而改进自己的工作。今天本报发表的老工人郁永康的文章和几篇论述高炉上的辩证法的文章，就是很好的例子。郁永康同志首先正确解决了人和产品的关系，懂得了为谁干活，为什么干活，把自己的日常工作同为革命的问题联系了起来；在这个基础上，又正确地分析了加工作业中存在的各种特殊矛盾，并加以正确的解决，这就使他能够做到十几年不出废品。他们的体会和经验，值得一读。
    我是大隆机器厂的车床工人，和摇手柄打了十多年的交道。从一九五四年我们厂公私合营以来，我做生活没有出过废品，超额完成了国家计划。有同志问我，你为什么十几年不出废品？过去我也说不清楚。最近学习了毛主席的《实践论》和《矛盾论》，回头看看自己的工作，心里有些明白了。下面就谈谈我十几年不出废品的体会。
          正确处理人和产品的关系
    我十五岁进大隆厂，到现在二十四年。二十四年来，我和产品的关系发生了很大的变化。现在我和产品的关系和过去不同了，我对产品的态度也不同了。
    解放前，我因为家里穷，才跑到大隆厂做童工。我生产产品，不过是为了混饭吃。产品是好是坏，我们工人做不了主。厂里有些铸件，砂眼大得连小孩的拳头也伸得进去，老板还是说好用。在老板看来，没有什么“质量”和“废品”，赚钱才是他的“标准”。
    解放初，我想：现在解放了，生活做好点不会吃亏，将来评级可以高一点，工钱可以大一点。我把产品做得好坏，看成是自己的“本钱”问题，老师傅的“面子”问题。因此，生产上只求“稳”，困难不敢闯，重担不敢挑，虽然没有出什么废品，但质量不能算过得硬。
    一九五四年，我们厂实行公私合营。这以后，厂里的生产任务发生了很大的变化，从生产纺织机件到制造冶金设备和化学肥料设备等。这些产品的精密度要求都比较高，有些本来要靠国外进口，现在要靠自己来做，有的还要出口支援别的国家。因此，我们能不能把它做好，这就不是个人的面子问题，而是中国工人的雄心问题，为革命人民争气的问题。每想到这里，浑身都是劲，困难敢去闯，担子重也要挑。象做高压水泵上的曲轴，它的平行度和椭圆度要求都很高，起初横做竖做做不好。想想在操作上，我算是当心的了，可能出毛病的地方，我全找过了，做出来还是个二等品，真有点灰心。后来，我想，产品升级这是赶超外国的问题。高压水泵，美帝国主义手上有，修正主义手上也有，它们能拿出第一流的，我们为什么只能拿出第二流的？心里实在不服气。于是采取三结合的办法来找原因，发现机床本身的刚性不够，花盘有些变型。经过有关方面的帮助，改装了机床上的车头、花盘和尾架，加强了刚性，产品质量升了级，产量也提高了一半。这件事情说明：要搞好生产、做好产品，首先要看到工人是产品的主人，要叫产品来表达出我们工人的革命雄心。
      促成事物的转化，达到革命的目的
    产品要用工具来加工。产品质量的好坏，和机床设备的精密度，工具量具的准确度，有一定的关系。但是条件好和条件差，都是相对的；而且在一定的条件下，是要相互转化的。再好的机床，还是有误差；两台机床的误差固然不同，就是同一部机床在同一个时期，由于加工的产品不同（产品的长短不同、轻重不同、几何形状不同），机床的误差也各不相同。如果我们盲目依赖机床的“精密性”，而思想不过硬，就是用再精密的机床来加工产品，也要出毛病。
    根据这些情况，我每用一部机床，不管它是精密的还是“老爷”的，总要先摸熟它的脾气，弄清它的误差；就是用熟了的机床，每次调换产品，也要先试一试，看看机床误差的程度怎么样。分厘卡是精密量具，但它也还有不精确的地方。因此一把分厘卡拿上手，我要先弄清它的误差，就是经常用的分厘卡，用过一阵也要看它有没有移动。由于“条件好”，做生活容易疏忽出毛病，我就这样要求自己：精密机床要当“老爷”机床来对待；老产品要当新产品来做，“好做”的活要当“难做”的活来做；交班同志说“没有问题”，我要当“有问题”去检查。我觉得：宁可注意“一万”，不可发生“万一”，条件越好越要从不利的方面去想，才能有备无患，把好条件真正利用起来。
      “条件差”当然也会出废品。但是不要因为条件差，就双手一摊。不利之中也有有利的地方。因为难做，思想重视，这是精神上的有利条件；因为不精确之中还有一定的“精确性”，这又是物质条件。有一次，我加工三百吨压钻机上的一只螺帽眼子。这只眼子有九百一十毫米长，加工误差不能超过四丝，但是用来加工的机床，本身却有凹度、凸度，误差倒有六丝。看起来机床的精密度不够，但只要想办法把这六丝误差避免掉，“老爷”机床还是可以做出好活来。于是我在刀架上装了一只丝表，用它来掌握产品的精度，切削的时候，我把眼睛睁得大大的，不让误差逃过去，这样加工出来的产品，也就只只合格了。
    在有利条件下找不利因素，在不利条件下找有利因素，我觉得这才符合于辩证法的革命精神，才能“促成事物的转化，达到革命的目的”。
        使总路线精神在产品上开花
    要做好产品，时间也是一个重要条件。但不是说，只有慢工才能出细活。“慢工”为什么“慢”，有的是干劲不足，不该慢的它慢了；有的是没有找到规律，做得不上路。如果干劲足，做法对头，“快工”就完全可以做出“细活”。有一次，我们加工大冷机零件的时候，根据图纸规定，只有两道工序。加工时间每只二百三十分钟，过去有些同志做过，实际上办不到，不但老是脱期，有时还要出废品。遇到这种“尴尬活”，确实很伤脑筋。起初有的同志提出，不增加一道工序，质量不会有保证。后来又想：增加工序，就要多花时间，要是不增加工序，而又保证质量，那就多快好省了。于是我们具体分析了产品的特点，找到了一个用一道工序就能做好的办法，经过领导同意去做，质量不但合格，产量还提高了一倍多。从实践中我深刻体会到，要解决多快和好省的矛盾，首先要坚持总路线的精神，遇事要鼓足干劲，力争上游；同时，也要从产品的实际出发，吃透产品的特点，采取全面措施，求得真正的多快好省，使总路线的精神在产品上开花。
    吃透产品的特点，就是“对于具体的事物作具体的分析”。不同的产品在不同的机床上加工，固然加工的方法不同；同样的产品在同样的机床上加工，也有不同的加工方法；在各种不同的加工方法中，又要比较它们的利弊得失，从这中间找出一种质量最可靠的、效率又最高的方法来。象一九六五年三月间，我做泥浆泵上的导板。这是个老产品，从一九五八年做到现在，生产定额大体上是从两个人工做一副逐步缩短到一个人工做一副。而这次由于装配方面要用，车间要我一个人工做两副。接到任务以后，我想，心急也没有用，还是从分析产品特点，来解决产品的加工问题。这个产品的特点是由两个半圆体并在一起加工，中间有空档，刀子在切削的时候，快了容易敲坏，这是不利因素，所以有人认为这种生活做不快。但是两个东西拼在一起加工，倒是断续切削，刀子上的热量容易发散，这又决定了车速能够加快，走刀量可以加大，这又是有利因素。但是，不利因素和有利因素对于产品各起多大作用，这时我还不清楚。于是我选了一把刀子作试验。为了避免刀子敲坏，我先把刀子的角度改变了一下；然后把车速逐步加快，从二十转加到六十转；又把走刀量逐步加大，从三十四丝加到六十丝，刀子没有敲坏，质量也很好，一个班做了三副，提前完成了生产计划。
              要争集体的荣誉
    在竞赛的高潮当中，也容易出废品。这时候，你做几只，我做几只，你追我赶，容易只求产量。在竞赛中能不能坚持质量第一，这里有一个能不能以国家得失为重，以个人得失为轻的问题。有一次和我搭班的青年工人创造了生产上的新成绩，比我做得快了。那天我人还没有走进车间，有的同志就对我讲：“今朝要看永康的了！”我听了就问自己：是不服气，还是承认落后，虚心学习呢？我想：建设大计，质量第一，我不能把个人的荣誉放在国家利益的上面。产量今天不管能不能赶上，质量第一的原则要坚持不放。我又想，人家快一定有道理，有长处，我慢是个短处，但我也有我的长处，把人家的长处学过来，再加上我的长处，两个长处加起来总比任何一方的长处强。当天，我向搭班的同志学习，既超过了搭班同志的产量，质量也很好。
    在比学赶帮超的活动中，能争的一定要争，暂时不能争的也不要硬争，而要创造条件去争。比如，有时候生产任务比较急，领导调我去做，有的同志开玩笑说：“现在要看永康的了！”开头两天，我就不争。因为产品刚拿上手，机床又不熟悉，我宁可做得比别人慢些，也不要冒冒失失去争。我觉得，冒冒失失，也是对国家不负责任；因此要在争的过程中，逐渐掌握客观规律，就能使产品达到多快好省。
            决心做两个“学生”
    我十几年来不出废品的根本原因是党的教育和群众的帮助。
    十几年来，党培养教育我，使我懂得了人活着为什么？做工又为啥？我读毛主席的书，还是这两年的事情。我发现，党平时教育我的一些根本的革命道理，毛主席的书上都明明白白地写着的。我要更好地懂得革命道理，就要好好地读毛主席的书，直接地听毛主席的教导。开始，我读的是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《反对自由主义》，我进一步懂得了，做一个革命的工人，要有一颗赤胆忠心，要有一股搬山的干劲，要有一套精益求精的本领，要有一个自我批评的精神。这些教导，都指导了我改造思想，搞好生产。一九六五年，我又学习了《实践论》、《矛盾论》和《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》这几篇哲学著作。我懂得了：马克思主义的哲学，是我们认识世界、改造世界最强大的武器。我也下定决心，要把毛泽东思想红旗高高举起，终生不放。要练好过硬本领，一丝不苟。
    我十几年不出废品，还多亏同志们的帮助。我们车间的老工人很多，有些我做起来没有把握的产品，都是他们帮助解决的。他们成功的经验对我有帮助，出废品的教训对我也有启发。有人说：“要学就要学先进，为什么要学废品？”我觉得：成功的事情，有时一下子还看不出经验；失败了的事情，反而可以找到活生生的教训。教训接受了，也就变成了经验。
    我学习毛主席著作的时间还很短，我工作做的还不够好。但是，我有信心学好、做好。我的决心和办法是：做毛主席的好学生，做群众的小学生。　（上海市总工会宣传部整理）
