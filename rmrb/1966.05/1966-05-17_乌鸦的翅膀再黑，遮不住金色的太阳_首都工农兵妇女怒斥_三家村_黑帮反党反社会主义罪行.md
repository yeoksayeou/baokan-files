    "No matter how black the crow's wings are, they cannot cover the golden sun"
    Capital's workers, peasants, soldiers, and women angrily denounce the "Three-Family Village" black gang's crimes against the Party and socialism
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 16th, advanced working women from the industrial, agricultural, financial, and trade fronts in Beijing, as well as female cadres of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, angrily denounced the crimes of the "Three-Family Village" black shop, headed by Deng Tuo, against the Party and socialism at a forum of workers, peasants, soldiers, and women in the capital on the 14th. They unanimously stated that workers, peasants, soldiers, and women must stand at the forefront of the struggle, defend the interests of the Party, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend the socialist state, destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop, eliminate all monsters and demons, and never stop fighting until complete victory is achieved.
    Luo Shuzhen, representative of the National People's Congress, national model worker, and postal worker at the Public Security Street Branch of the Beijing Post Office; Han Chaxian, national March 8th Red Banner Holder, national model worker, and loom operator at the Beijing Velvet Carpet Factory; Ma Xiuyun, deputy director and deputy factory director of the Political Department of the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill, who came from a child labor background; and Kong Xiuying, a binding worker at the Xinhua Printing Factory, angrily denounced Deng Tuo, saying: We in the working class have suffered enough in the old society and deeply know the sweetness of the new society. Deng Tuo nonsensically claimed that our Party is "untrustworthy" and wanted our Party to step down and "rest." This is his delusion of restoring capitalism in China, changing the color of our country, and forcing us in the working class to return to the bitter years, serving as beasts of burden for capitalists. No way, absolutely no way! Our working class absolutely will not agree.
    Han Chaxian and Ma Xiuyun powerfully refuted Deng Tuo's slander against the General Line and the Great Leap Forward with facts. Ma Xiuyun said that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, holding high the three red banners, achieved a comprehensive leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results and was rated as one of the national Daqing-style advanced enterprises. This is an ironclad fact. This black gang Deng Tuo wants to erase our achievements with slander, which is completely wishful thinking. On the contrary, it can only expose their true anti-Party face.
    Female poor peasant commune members Li Fenglan, Song Wenmei, Pang Guixiang, and Gao Shiqin from rural people's communes in the Beijing suburbs stated in their speeches: Poor and lower-middle peasant women must not only hold onto the hoe handle but also firmly grasp the seal handle, pick up the pen, destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop, and uproot all anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds.
    Li Fenglan, a female commune member of the Demao Brigade of the Hongxing Commune in Daxing County and a member of the municipal Poor Peasants' Association, said, "We poor and lower-middle peasants love the Party and Chairman Mao the most. No matter how hard Deng Tuo tries to viciously attack, he cannot cover up the glory of our Party in the slightest, nor can he shake our belief in Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants are of one heart with the Party. Whoever scolds our Party or moves our Party, no matter who he is, no matter how high his position, or what tricks he plays, we will fight him to the end."
    Ciren Lamu, a Tibetan student at the Central University for Nationalities who was seized by serf owners as a slave from a young age and suffered all kinds of oppression, said: "Deng Tuo's curses against our Party are the same as those spoken by the Tibetan serf owners. Without the Party, without Chairman Mao, without the revolution, there would be no New Tibet today. Without the Party, without Chairman Mao, I, Ciren Lamu, would not know where I would have died. Deng Tuo wants to seize our revolutionary banner and let the bourgeoisie and serf owners make a comeback. This is a dream. The revolutionary banner was dyed red with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. We must defend it and pass on the revolutionary red flag and Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation."
    In an article, Deng Tuo incited people to learn from the feudal scholar-official Zheng Banqiao, to "be masters of themselves, not slaves," and to "blaze their own trail" to oppose the Party and socialism along with them. Xie Bingqin, leader of the sales group of the Beilishi Road Non-Staple Food Store and a "Six-Good" worker, refuted his conspiracy. Xie Bingqin said: "We in the working class of New China are the masters of the country. Deng Tuo is provoking us not to listen to the Party, not to listen to Chairman Mao. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and take the bright road of proletarian revolution. We will never take the black road of capitalist restoration."
    Zhou Xiuling, a staff member's family member and director of the Chaoyangmen Street Residents' Committee in Beijing, used her own experience at the symposium to powerfully refute Deng Tuo's lies that our Party "does not cherish the labor force." She also said: "We must listen to the Party and Chairman Mao in everything we do, keep our eyes open, occupy the position of street work, closely monitor landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and not allow anti-Party elements like Deng Tuo to talk nonsense and act recklessly."
    Li Landing, representative of the National People's Congress and director of the Third Outpatient Department of the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Yang Xinghuo, a writer from the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the Tibet Military Region who is currently in Beijing for a meeting, said: "Our People's Liberation Army must not only hold on tightly to the gun to defend our motherland but also pick up the pen to fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend socialism." Yang Xinghuo said that we Tibetans have a saying: "No matter how black the crow's wings are, they cannot cover the golden sun." Deng Tuo, your curses and slanders can only be like a flock of crows cawing, while Mao Zedong Thought is like the rising sun, shining brilliantly!
    Zhao Weixin, deputy manager of the Tianqiao Department Store, once submitted an article criticizing Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," but it was returned by the *Beijing Daily* with reasons such as "not specific" and "cannot refute the person." Zhao Weixin and the women who participated in the meeting angrily accused *Beijing Daily*, *Frontline*, and *Beijing Evening News* of using all kinds of tricks to try to cover up the criminal behavior of Deng Tuo and others in trying to muddle through.

### “乌鸦的翅膀再黑，遮不住金色的太阳”  首都工农兵妇女怒斥“三家村”黑帮反党反社会主义罪行

    “乌鸦的翅膀再黑，遮不住金色的太阳”
    首都工农兵妇女怒斥“三家村”  黑帮反党反社会主义罪行
    据新华社十六日讯　北京市工业、农业、财贸等各个战线上的先进劳动妇女和中国人民解放军的女干部，十四日在首都工农兵妇女座谈会上愤怒斥责以邓拓为首的“三家村”黑店反党反社会主义的罪行。她们一致表示，工农兵妇女一定要站在斗争的最前列，保卫党的利益，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫社会主义江山，摧毁“三家村”黑店，扫除一切牛鬼蛇神，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    全国人民代表大会代表、全国劳动模范、北京市邮局公安街支局邮递员罗淑珍，全国三八红旗手、全国劳动模范、北京绒毯厂挡车工韩茶仙，童工出身的北京国棉二厂政治部副主任兼副厂长马秀云，新华印刷厂装订工人孔秀英等愤怒地斥责邓拓说：我们工人阶级受尽旧社会的苦，深知新社会的甜。邓拓胡说我们的党“不堪信任”，要我们党下台“休息”，这是他妄想在中国复辟资本主义，让我们国家变颜色，要我们工人阶级重新回到苦难的年代，给资本家当牛当马。不行，一万个不行！我们工人阶级绝对不答应。
    韩茶仙和马秀云用事实有力地驳斥了邓拓对总路线、大跃进的污蔑。马秀云说，我们北京第二棉纺织厂在党中央和毛主席的领导下，高举三面红旗，实现了多快好省的全面跃进，被评为全国大庆式先进企业之一。这是铁的事实。邓拓这个黑帮想用污蔑来抹煞我们的成就，完全是枉费心机，相反，只能是暴露他们反党的真实面目。
    北京郊区农村人民公社的贫农女社员李凤兰、宋文美、庞桂香、高士芹等在发言中表示：贫下中农妇女不仅要握住锄把子，更要握紧印把子，拿起笔杆子，摧毁“三家村”黑店，把一切反党反社会主义的毒草连根拔掉。
    大兴县红星公社德茂大队女社员、市贫协委员李凤兰说，我们贫下中农最热爱党、最热爱毛主席。不管邓拓怎样挖空心思恶毒攻击，丝毫也遮盖不了我们党的光辉，丝毫动摇不了我们对毛泽东思想的信仰。我们贫下中农同党心连心，谁骂我们党一下，动我们党一下，不管他是什么人，不管他有多高职位，耍什么手腕，我们都要同他拼到底。
    从小就被农奴主抢去作奴隶，受尽压迫蹂躏的中央民族学院藏族学员次仁拉姆说：邓拓咒骂我们党的话，同西藏农奴主嘴里说出来的一样。没有党，没有毛主席，没有革命，就没有今天的新西藏。没有党，没有毛主席，我次仁拉姆不知道死到什么地方去了。邓拓想夺去我们革命的大旗，让资产阶级、农奴主卷土重来，这是梦想。革命的大旗是无数革命烈士用鲜血染红的，我们要保卫它，要把革命的红旗、毛泽东思想世世代代传下去。
    邓拓在一篇文章里煽动人们向封建士大夫郑板桥学习，“自作主人，不当奴才”，“自己踏出一条路来”，同他们一起反党反社会主义。北礼士路副食品商店售货组长、六好职工谢炳琴在发言中对他的这一阴谋诡计作了驳斥。谢炳琴说：我们新中国的工人阶级就是国家的主人。邓拓挑拨我们不要听党的话，不要听毛主席的话，我们就是要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，走无产阶级革命的光明大道，决不走资本主义复辟的黑路。
    职工家属、北京朝阳门大街居民委员会主任周秀玲在座谈会上以切身的经历有力地驳斥了邓拓污蔑我们党“不爱护劳动力”的谎言。她还说：我们要时时事事听党的话，听毛主席的话，擦亮眼睛，占领住街道工作这个阵地，严密地监视地富反坏，不许邓拓之类的反党分子乱说乱动。
    全国人民代表大会代表、中国人民解放军总参谋部第三门诊部主任李兰丁和正在北京开会的西藏军区政治部文化部创作员杨星火等说：我们解放军不仅要紧握枪杆子保卫我们的祖国，而且要拿起笔杆子向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫社会主义。杨星火说，我们西藏有这么一句话“乌鸦的翅膀再黑，遮不住金色的太阳”。邓拓，你们的咒骂、诬蔑，只能象一群乌鸦乱叫，毛泽东思想却象东升的太阳，光芒万丈！
    天桥百货商场副经理赵维新曾经投稿批判吴晗的《海瑞罢官》，被《北京日报》以“不具体”“驳不倒人家”等理由退回来了。赵维新和参加会议的妇女都气愤地指责《北京日报》、《前线》、《北京晚报》耍尽花招，企图包庇邓拓等人蒙混过关的罪恶行为。
