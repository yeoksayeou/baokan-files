    The Most Fundamental Thing is the Revolutionization of the Leadership Team
    To run an enterprise well, the first thing is to build a revolutionary team;
    The most fundamental issue in building a team is the revolutionization of the leadership team

    The experience of Daqing tells us that to run an enterprise well, the first thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to build a very proletarian, revolutionary, and combat-ready team. The most fundamental issue in team building is the revolutionization of the leadership team. If the leadership team is not revolutionized, it will not be able to lead a revolutionary team. The Daqing team is so strong because they put the revolutionization of the leadership team in the primary position of team building.
    The most fundamental aspect of leadership revolutionization is to closely follow Chairman Mao's thought, that is, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's thought. At any time, in any work, and under any conditions, we must resolutely and faithfully act in accordance with Chairman Mao's thought and in accordance with the central authorities' line, principles, and policies. Not only should the leaders themselves closely follow Chairman Mao's thought, but they should also lead the team to follow closely, quickly, accurately, and well.
    Daqing put forward the "Three-Point Agreement" for leading cadres. This is an important measure for Daqing to follow the five conditions for cultivating revolutionary successors put forward by Chairman Mao and the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" for party and government cadres, inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, and is also an important measure to prevent revisionism and avoid bureaucracy. Now, our factory has taken Daqing's "Three-Point Agreement" as a system that every cadre must implement and as a code of conduct for every cadre. We have also formulated some systems for leading cadres in accordance with the spirit of the "Three-Point Agreement" and in light of the specific conditions of our factory, and they have been resolutely implemented, such as not allowing special privileges, leading cadres living in the same houses as the masses, and visiting workers' homes during normal times and festivals to understand workers' ideological, work, and living problems. Not putting sofas in offices and conference rooms, not pursuing extravagance and ostentation, etc.
    In learning from Daqing's experience, we have also implemented the practice of leading cadres persisting in participating in labor, going deep into the grassroots to stay at selected points, conducting investigations and research, paying attention to grasping typical examples and setting up models, and using points to lead the whole area. After doing this, the work has become more orderly and methodical, more information has been obtained, and bureaucracy has been greatly reduced.
    Inspired by Daqing's experience, we have also stepped up the construction of leadership teams at all levels, and promoted 145 young and outstanding cadres to leadership positions. They have good ideas, great enthusiasm, and high enthusiasm, but they generally lack leadership experience. In order to improve their skills, we fully trust them, boldly use them, and let them go to the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment to temper themselves. In addition, we also organize short-term training to cultivate and improve them. In the past year, our factory has successively held six training courses for workshop directors, instructors, and team leaders, each lasting ten to twelve days, training a total of 440 workshop leaders and team leaders. The main focus of the training is on how to give prominence to politics and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In order to better learn Daqing's experience, our factory has also sent leaders at all levels to Daqing for study many times. After the study, everyone unanimously felt that seeing is believing, and seeing the spirit of Daqing with their own eyes has given them more confidence and determination to further learn from Daqing. Through the above series of work, the leadership level of the grassroots leadership teams has been greatly improved.

    最根本的是领导班子革命化
    要办好一个企业，首先要建设一支革命化的队伍；
    建设队伍最根本的问题是领导班子革命化
    大庆的经验告诉我们，要办好一个企业，首先就要用毛泽东思想建设一支非常无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的队伍。而队伍建设最根本的问题是领导班子革命化。领导班子不革命化，就不会带出一支革命化的队伍来。大庆队伍所以过硬，就是他们把领导班子的革命化放到队伍建设的首要地位。
    领导革命化，最根本的是紧跟毛主席思想，就是要对毛主席思想无限忠诚，任何时候，任何工作，任何条件下，都要坚定不移、原原本本地按照毛主席思想办事，按照中央的路线、方针、政策办事，不但领导本身要紧跟毛主席思想，还要带上队伍跟得紧，跟得快，跟得准，跟得好。
    大庆提出了领导干部“约法三章”，这是大庆遵照毛主席提出的关于培养革命接班人五个条件和党政干部“三大纪律、八项注意”，继承和发扬艰苦奋斗优良传统的重要措施，也是防止修正主义、避免官僚主义的重要措施。现在，我们厂已经把大庆的“约法三章”作为每个干部必须执行的制度，作为每个干部的行动准则。我们还按照“约法三章”的精神，结合我厂的具体情况，对领导干部制定了一些制度，并已坚决执行，如不准特殊化，领导干部和群众住一样的房子，平时和逢年过节都要到职工家里去走访，了解职工的思想、工作和生活问题。在办公室、会议室里不摆沙发，不追求阔气讲排场，等等。
    我们学习大庆的经验，还实行了领导干部坚持参加劳动，深入基层蹲点，调查研究，注意抓典型、树样板，以点带面，这样作了以后，工作更有秩序，更有条理了，了解的情况也更多了，官僚主义大大减少了。
    在大庆经验的启发下，我们也抓紧了各级领导班子的建设，把一百四十五名年青优秀干部提拔到领导岗位上来。他们思想好、干劲大、热情高，但是一般都缺少领导经验。为了提高他们的本领，我们对他们充分信任，大胆使用，让他们到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动中去锻炼。另外还组织短期训练，培养提高。近一年来，我厂先后举办了六期车间主任、指导员和组长训练班，每期十至十二天，共训练了四百四十名车间领导干部和班组长。在训练中主要是学习如何突出政治，活学活用主席著作。为了更好的把大庆的经验学到手，我厂还多次派各级领导干部到大庆学习。学习以后，大家一致感到，百闻不如一见，亲眼看到了大庆精神，对进一步学好大庆，更有了信心和决心。通过上述一系列的工作，基层领导班子的领导水平有了很大的提高。
