    Deng Tuo viciously incited people to be "concerned about everything" like the Donglin Party members of the Ming Dynasty. Like him, "concerned about everything": he was concerned when right-leaning opportunists were removed from office; he was concerned about Li Sancai, a political corpse from four hundred years ago; he was concerned about "The Biography of a Poor Scholar"; he was even concerned about the "long hair" of a "beauty." In a word, everything that could be used to oppose the Party and socialism, everything that capitalist restoration needed, he would "break down the door" and be insidiously concerned about. Not just concerned, but personally involved, adding fuel to the fire. The large collection of over 150 essays, "Yanshan Evening Talks," is a testament to his "concern about everything" and ironclad proof of his opposition to the Party, the people, and socialism!
              Students of Peking University: Wang Chunting, Zheng Guozhi
      The "Three-Family Village" gang slanders us as being "scared to death of ghosts," which is utter nonsense! Revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought have accumulated rich experience in fighting "ghosts," and we always have ways to defeat them completely. Twenty years ago, we defeated the Japanese devils, and then we defeated Chiang Kai-shek, this ghost, and we drove the American devils out of the mainland. The Khrushchev revisionist ghost was also beaten to the point of near death by us. As for your "Three-Family Village," this small bunch of black ghosts, they are even less of a problem.
    Veteran Red Army Soldier, Deputy Director of Yuhuatai Martyrs' Cemetery: Yang Ruijiang
    Deng Tuo smears our Party for "not cherishing labor power," which is simply turning black into white. Before liberation, we workers were treated like beasts of burden by the capitalists all year round. After liberation, we workers, under the leadership of the Party, completely turned ourselves over and became masters of the country. In the old society, I was a "stinking worker," but now I have become a municipal people's representative and have also been promoted to engineer. This was unimaginable in the old society! In particular, the Party has repeatedly emphasized the need to combine work and rest, and is always concerned about the health and safety of workers. All of this eloquently proves that our Party is the most concerned about the people and cherishes labor power the most. Deng Tuo, you can forget about trying to provoke our relationship with the Party. The Party is the lifeline of our working people, and we are determined to follow the Party!

    来稿摘编
    邓拓恶毒地煽动人们要象明代东林党人那样，“事事关心”。象他那样，“事事关心”：右倾机会主义分子被罢官，他关心；四百年前的政治僵尸李三才，他关心；《贫士传》，他关心；直到“美人”的“长发”，他也关心。一句话，凡是可以利用来反党反社会主义的一切，凡是资本主义复辟需要的一切，他统统要“破门而出”地，无孔不入地关心。何止关心而已，而且亲自动手，推波助澜。一百五十多篇杂文的一大本《燕山夜话》，正是他“事事关心”的见证，也是他反党反人民反社会主义的铁证！

      “三家村”黑帮诬蔑我们“怕鬼怕得要死”，这完全是一派胡说！用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，与“鬼”作斗争积累了丰富的经验，我们总有办法把他打得落花流水。二十年前，我们打倒了日本鬼，接着又打倒了蒋介石这个鬼，美国鬼也被我们赶出大陆。赫鲁晓夫修正主义这个鬼也被我们打得奄奄一息。至于你们“三家村”这一小撮黑鬼，就更不在话下了。
    老红军战士、雨花台烈士陵园管理处副主任　杨瑞江
    邓拓污蔑我们党“不爱护劳动力”，这简直是颠倒黑白。解放前，我们工人一年四季为资本家做牛当马。解放后，我们工人才在党的领导下，彻底翻了身，成了国家的主人。我在旧社会是一个“臭工人”，现在当上了市人民代表，还被提拔为工程师，这在旧社会做梦也想不到！特别是，党一再强调要劳逸结合，处处关心工人身体健康和安全，这都雄辩地证明，我们党是最关心人民群众，最爱护劳动力的。邓拓，你休想挑拨我们工人和党的关系，党是我们劳动人民的命根子，我们跟党走定啦！
