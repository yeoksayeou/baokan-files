Title: Singapore's "People's Forum" Says Modern Revisionism Has Become a Pillar of U.S. Imperialism; Only By Resolutely Opposing Revisionism Can We Better Oppose U.S. Imperialism; Soviet Leaders' Help to U.S. Imperialism in Promoting the Peace Talks Fraud on the Vietnam Issue Has Become an Open Secret

    Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Singapore: The Singapore People's Party newspaper, *People's Forum*, published an article on May 1st stating that the struggle against U.S. imperialism and the struggle against revisionism should proceed simultaneously; without opposing revisionism, one cannot better oppose U.S. imperialism.

    The article, signed "Observer," pointed out that U.S. imperialism has become the common enemy of people worldwide. The article stated: "We believe that it is very necessary and correct to call on the people of all continents around the world to unite, to call on all peace-loving countries to unite, and to form the broadest united front against the United States. This is a great call. This behemoth of U.S. imperialism can be divided and eliminated piece by piece."

    The article stated: "To deal with the aggression of U.S. imperialism, it is necessary to mobilize all the people and launch a people's war. In this regard, the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation provides us with a brilliant example. Countless historical facts prove that the fundamental factors determining the outcome of a war are people and the nature of the war. The international anti-U.S. united front and people's war are the two magic weapons to defeat U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. If the people of the world firmly grasp these two magic weapons and give full play to their power, they will surely be able to completely overthrow U.S. imperialism."

    The article stated: "In the international scope of class struggle, nothing is more harmful than harboring illusions about imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism. Whoever believes in the 'sincerity' of U.S. imperialism's peace negotiations, trusts its agreements, takes its 'guarantees' seriously, and thinks that a piece of treaty or agreement will make U.S. imperialism's aggressive ambitions 'restrained' and become more well-behaved can truly be said to be incredibly foolish. If one harbors illusions about U.S. imperialism, one will ultimately suffer losses from U.S. imperialism oneself. If one's own illusions are not enough and one wants to spread these illusions to others, then objectively one is doing U.S. imperialism a great favor. This is what the people of all countries must resolutely oppose. In class struggle, nothing is more harmful than harboring illusions about class enemies."

    The article stated: "Modern revisionists painstakingly and meticulously whitewash U.S. imperialism, nonsensically claiming that in the 'new situation,' there has emerged a 'struggle' between two major groups of 'belligerents' and 'enlightened people' among the imperialists. They call Eisenhower and Kennedy, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of various countries, people who 'sincerely hope for peace' and are 'supported by the American people.' They even insist that Johnson, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, the Congolese (L) people, and the Dominican people, is a 'sober-minded' 'enlightened person.' However, it is none other than these U.S. imperialist ringleaders, who have been touted as 'enlightened' and 'peace-loving,' who have repeatedly and heavily slapped the faces of modern revisionism with their bloody acts of aggression. They themselves have torn off the mask of 'peace-loving' that they wore. In the face of bloody facts, many people who have been fooled by U.S. imperialism and revisionism have awakened one after another. Revisionism is more isolated than ever before. In this situation, revisionists are forced to slightly change their tune and have to shout anti-U.S. slogans and make some fake anti-U.S. gestures, changing their collusion with U.S. imperialism from open agreement to covert cooperation, implementing a policy of 'light scolding and heavy help' towards U.S. imperialism."

    The article stated: "Modern revisionism is the main accomplice of U.S. imperialism in playing counter-revolutionary dual tactics. Modern revisionists mix within the anti-imperialist camp, carrying out activities of division and disruption. Especially when U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression faces bankruptcy, revisionists will certainly rush out to find a way out for U.S. imperialism, allowing it to step down gracefully.

    "U.S. imperialism is accustomed to playing 'peace deception,' and revisionism comes out to advocate 'peace negotiations.' In the past, revisionism touted the 'Camp David spirit,' and now revisionism touts the so-called 'Tashkent spirit,' the purpose of which is to get the people of all countries to abandon the tit-for-tat struggle against imperialism and aggressors, and to get the people of all countries to accept the 'peace talks' fraud played by imperialism and aggressors. No wonder the U.S. imperialists expressed satisfaction and praise for the 'Tashkent meeting' organized by the Soviet Union. On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet revisionist leaders have repeatedly flirted with the United States, exchanged intelligence, and even acted as messengers for the United States, helping the United States engage in the 'peace talks' fraud. This has become an open secret."

    The article stated: "U.S. imperialism is accustomed to engaging in war blackmail against the people of all countries, especially by waving its few atomic bombs to scare people and force them to surrender. Revisionism comes to cooperate, spreading war terror on a large scale, for example, saying that a spark in a certain place on earth will lead to a world war, and that the outbreak of a world war will mean the extinction of mankind, and so on. Revisionism does not emphasize that imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is the main source of war, but instead opposes all wars indiscriminately, regardless of whether they are just or unjust. If we accept this set of revisionism, wouldn't the people of all countries be prevented from using just wars to oppose wars of aggression? Wouldn't this mean that the current war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation being waged by the Vietnamese people is also impermissible? From this, it can be seen that revisionism's 'theory of war' is a 'theory of war' that does not distinguish between just and unjust wars, and a 'theory of war' that opposes and obstructs the people of all countries from using revolutionary wars to oppose counter-revolutionary wars. Needless to say, this 'theory of war' is intended to disarm the revolutionary people and greatly help U.S. imperialism."

    The article stated: "Since modern revisionism has always been mixed in the anti-imperialist camp, using beautiful anti-imperialist rhetoric to conceal its true face, it often plays a role that the exposed running dogs of U.S. imperialism cannot play. Modern revisionism has in fact become one of the pillars on which U.S. imperialism relies for its survival. Therefore, the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States must be closely combined with the struggle against modern revisionism. The anti-U.S. and anti-revisionist struggles should proceed simultaneously; without opposing revisionism, one cannot better oppose the United States. There is no room for dispute, and there should be no hesitation."

    The article stated: "We must not be deceived by revisionism and fail to recognize the main enemies of the people of all countries. In the just struggle of the people of the world, who is our enemy and who is our friend is a primary question. If enemies and friends are not distinguished, and the relationship between enemies and friends is reversed, the struggle will inevitably fail. Today, a large number of facts prove that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world. All people who demand independence and liberation, all people who cherish their national independence and sovereignty, and all people who are unwilling to be subjected to aggression, control, exploitation, and oppression must rise up to oppose the world's largest aggressor, the largest exploiter and oppressor—U.S. imperialism."

### 新加坡《人民论坛》说现代修正主义已成美帝支柱  只有坚决反对修正主义才能更好地反对美帝  苏联领导人在越南问题上帮助美帝国主义推销和谈骗局已成公开秘密

    新加坡《人民论坛》说现代修正主义已成美帝支柱
    只有坚决反对修正主义才能更好地反对美帝
    苏联领导人在越南问题上帮助美帝国主义推销和谈骗局已成公开秘密
    新华社十日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡人民党机关报《人民论坛》五月一日发表的文章说，反对美帝国主义和反对修正主义的斗争应该双管齐下，不反对修正主义，就不能更好地反对美帝国主义。
    这篇署名“观察者”的文章指出，美帝国主义已成为全世界人民的共同敌人。文章说：“我们认为，号召全世界各大洲的人民联合起来，号召所有爱好和平的国家联合起来，结成最广泛的反美统一战线，这是非常必要和正确的，这是一个伟大的号召。美帝国主义这个庞然大物是可以分割的，是可以一部分一部分地消灭掉的。”
    文章说：“对付美帝国主义的侵略，必须动员全体人民，展开人民战争。在这方面，越南人民的抗美救国斗争为我们提供了光辉的典范。无数的历史事实证明，决定战争胜负的根本因素是人，是战争的性质。国际反美统一战线和人民战争，这是打败美帝国主义及其走狗的两大法宝。全世界人民抓紧这两大法宝，充分发挥这两大法宝的威力，就一定能把美帝国主义彻底打倒。”
    文章说：“在国际范围内进行阶级斗争，最有害的莫过于对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义产生幻想。谁要是相信了美帝国主义和平谈判的‘诚意’，信赖了它的协议，把它的‘保证’当真，以为一纸条约或协议书就会使美帝国主义的侵略野心‘收敛’，变得规矩一点，那真可说是愚不可及。自己对美帝国主义存在幻想，到头来是自己吃美帝国主义的亏，如果自己幻想还不够，还要向人散播这种幻想，那在客观上就帮了美帝国主义的大忙，这是各国人民必须坚决反对的。在阶级斗争中，最有害的莫过于对阶级敌人产生幻想。”
    文章说：“现代修正主义者苦心孤诣，惟恐不周地替美帝国主义涂脂抹粉，胡扯什么在‘新的形势下’，帝国主义者当中出现了‘好战派’和‘明智派’的两大集团的‘斗争’。他们把双手沾满各国人民鲜血的艾森豪威尔和肯尼迪称为‘真诚希望和平’、‘得到美国人民拥护’的人。他们还把双手沾满越南人民、刚果（利）人民和多米尼加人民鲜血的约翰逊，硬说成是‘脑子清醒’的‘明智派’。但是，不是别人，正是这些被吹捧为‘明智派’和‘爱好和平’的美帝国主义头子，用他们的血淋淋的侵略勾当，一次又一次地、沉重地打了现代修正主义的嘴巴，他们自己撕下了自己所挂的‘爱好和平’的假面具。在血淋淋的事实面前，许多上过美帝国主义的当、上过修正主义的当的人都纷纷醒悟过来了，修正主义比过去任何时候都孤立。在这种情况下，修正主义者被迫稍稍改变腔调，不得不喊一喊反美的口号，做一些反美的假动作，同美帝国主义的勾结从公开呼应改变为暗中配合，对美帝国主义实行‘小骂大帮忙’的政策。”
    文章说：“现代修正主义是美帝国主义玩弄反革命两手策略的主要帮手，现代修正主义者混在反帝阵营内部，进行分裂和扰乱活动。特别是在美帝国主义的侵略政策面临破产时，修正主义者就一定赶紧跑出来，为美帝国主义寻找出路，让它下得了台。
    “美帝国主义惯于玩弄‘和平欺骗’，修正主义就出来鼓吹‘和平谈判’。过去，修正主义鼓吹‘戴维营精神’，现在，修正主义则鼓吹所谓‘塔什干精神’，其目的都是要各国人民放弃同帝国主义，同侵略者进行针锋相对的斗争，要各国人民接受帝国主义和侵略者玩弄的‘和谈’骗局。无怪乎美帝国主义者对苏联所搞的‘塔什干会谈’表示满意和夸奖。在越南问题上，苏联的修正主义领导人多次同美国眉来眼去，互通情报，还充当美国的信差，帮助美国搞‘和谈’骗局，这已是公开了的秘密。”
    文章说：“美帝国主义惯于对各国人民进行战争讹诈，特别是挥舞它的几颗原子弹吓人，迫人向它屈膝投降。修正主义就来个配合，大肆传播战争恐怖，比如说什么地球上某个地方的星星之火，就会酿成世界大战，而世界大战一爆发，就是人类的灭亡等等。修正主义不强调帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义是战争的主要根源，而是不区别正义战争抑或非正义战争，只要是战争就一概反对。如果接受了修正主义的这一套，各国人民岂不是不应该用正义的战争去反对侵略战争了吗？这岂不是说目前越南人民所进行的抗美救国的战争也是不应该的吗？由此可见，修正主义的‘战争论’，是不分正义战争和非正义战争的‘战争论’，是反对和阻挠各国人民用革命的战争去反对反革命战争的‘战争论’。不用说，这种‘战争论’是为了解除革命人民的武装，给美帝国主义帮了大忙。”
    文章说：“由于现代修正主义一直混在反帝阵营里，用反帝的漂亮言词掩盖它的真面目，它往往起了美帝国主义的露面走狗所不能起的作用，现代修正主义在事实上已成为美帝国主义赖以生存的支柱之一。因此，反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争，必须同反对现代修正主义的斗争紧密结合起来。反美和反修斗争应该双管齐下，不反修，就不能更好地反美，这是没有争辩余地的，是不应该犹疑的。”
    文章说：“我们决不能受修正主义的欺骗，认不清各国人民的主要敌人。在世界人民的正义斗争中，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，这是一个首要问题。如果敌友分不清，敌友关系到置，斗争就难免于失败。今天，大量的事实证明，美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人，一切要求独立、解放的人们，一切珍惜自己的国家独立主权的人们，一切不愿受侵略、控制、剥削和压迫的人们，都必须起来反对世界上最大的侵略者，最大的剥削和压迫者——美帝国主义。”
