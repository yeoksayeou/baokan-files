	Strengthening Party building is the guarantee for doing all work well; studying Chairman Mao's writings well is the foundation for strengthening Party building. The article by Zhou Pengjiang, the Party Branch Secretary of the Sanzhou Brigade in Lianyi Commune, Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province, vividly illustrates this truth.
	How can we study Chairman Mao's writings well, strengthen Party building, and do all work well? Of the thousands of things to do, the most important is to closely link the study of Chairman Mao's writings with the ideological and practical realities of the region, department, and individual, and use Mao Zedong Thought to solve various ideological and work-related problems. We advocate the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings, especially focusing on the "application" aspect, and that is the reason why. "Application" means solving problems in a targeted manner. The standard for judging whether one has studied Chairman Mao's writings well is whether one can solve problems in a targeted manner. The experience of the Sanzhou Brigade Party Branch shows that because they tasted the sweetness of the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings, constantly using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the "target" of actual problems in their branch and brigade's ideology and work, they quickly changed the people's mental state, strengthened Party building, and promoted production.
	The experience of the Sanzhou Brigade Party Branch in the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings also shows that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings in a living way in struggle and practice can we maximize the infinite power of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 要有的放矢

    要有的放矢
    加强党的建设，是做好一切工作的保证；学好毛主席著作，是加强党的建设的根本。江苏省东台县廉贻公社三周大队党支部书记周朋江的文章，生动地说明了这一真理。
    怎样才能学好毛主席著作，加强党的建设，做好一切工作呢？千条万条，最主要的一条，是把学习毛主席著作，同本地区、本部门和本人的思想实际与工作实际密切地联系起来，用毛泽东思想解决思想上、工作中的各种问题。我们提倡活学活用毛主席著作，特别是在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是这个道理。“用”，就是有的放矢地解决问题。判断是不是学好了毛主席著作的标准，就是看是否能够有的放矢地解决问题。三周大队党支部的经验说明了，他们由于尝到了活学活用毛主席著作的甜头，不断用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射他们支部、大队中的思想和工作上的实际问题之“的”，很快地改变了人的精神状态，加强了党的建设，促进了生产。
    三周大队党支部活学活用毛主席著作的经验也说明了，只有在斗争中、实践中活学活用毛主席著作，才能够最大限度地发挥毛泽东思想的无穷威力。
