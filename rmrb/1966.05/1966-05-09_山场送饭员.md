    Mountain Field Food Delivery Worker
    Northeast Forestry Bureau Worker Liu Dechang
Hidden and appearing among the green trees,
A string of songs shaking down from the clouds,
The carrying pole creaks with song,
Who? The mountain field food delivery worker.
The little carrying pole trembles,
Like a wild goose spreading its wings;
Treading on mountain rocks, crossing mountain streams,
Trained a pair of iron feet!
The boundless dense forest—dare to drill!
The towering cliffs—dare to climb!
A heart tied tightly to the mountain field,
The mountains and waters are all carried on her shoulders!
Listen, in the lumberjack's small hut,
She is singing "We are revolutionary youth,"
Look, under the towering pine trees,
She tells the lumberjacks "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains"…
Hidden and appearing among the green trees,
A string of songs shaking down from the clouds,
Here she comes! The lumberjacks welcome her,
With felled red pines, and picked azaleas…

    山场送饭员
    东北林业局工人　刘德昌绿树间忽隐忽现，云雾里抖下歌声一串，扁担吚呀歌不断，谁？山场送饭员。小扁担颤呀颤，好象张开翅膀的雁；踩山石，跨山涧，练就一双铁脚板！无边的密林——敢钻！插天的石崖——敢攀！一颗心和山场系的紧，这山呀水呀都在她肩上担！听，在伐木工的小屋里，她在唱“我们是革命青年”，看，在巍然挺拔的松树下，她给伐木工讲《愚公移山》……绿树间忽隐忽现，云雾里抖下歌声一串，来了！伐木工迎接她，用伐倒的红松，采来的杜鹃……
