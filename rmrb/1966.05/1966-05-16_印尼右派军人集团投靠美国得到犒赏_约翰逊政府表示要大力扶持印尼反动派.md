    (Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 15th) News broadcast by Jakarta Radio on the 14th indicates that the U.S. Johnson administration is pleased that the Indonesian right-wing military clique has seized power and is prepared to infiltrate Indonesia by providing "aid."

    The Antara News Agency correspondent in Washington reported in a dispatch broadcast by the radio station: "The development of the domestic situation in Indonesia has given the United States the need to restore cooperation with Indonesia. It appears that the United States is also prepared to assist Indonesia in all aspects."

    The dispatch stated that the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently discussed the 1967 U.S. "foreign aid program," including the issue of providing "aid" to Indonesia. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk stated at the meeting that the United States must "assist" Indonesia. Rusk also recalled that "two years ago, due to the political situation in Indonesia (Editor's note: referring to Indonesia's confrontation with the neo-colonial product 'Malaysia'), the United States suspended economic aid to Indonesia."

    According to a report by Jakarta Radio, a government delegation dispatched by the right-wing military regime arrived in New York on the 12th to beg for U.S. "aid." This is the first official delegation sent to the United States after the right-wing military regime declared its establishment.

    Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Hamengkubuwono IX disclosed in a statement on domestic economic issues at a joint session of the Cooperative Parliament that the right-wing military regime had reached an agreement with the United States that negotiations on U.S. "aid" would be held in Jakarta between the regime and the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia. When discussing Indonesia's urgent need for loans from Japan and Western countries, he said: "The recovery and stability of our economy greatly requires such loans."

    印尼右派军人集团投靠美国得到犒赏
    约翰逊政府表示要大力扶持印尼反动派
    据新华社十五日讯　雅加达电台十四日广播的消息表明：美国约翰逊政府对印度尼西亚右派军人集团夺取了政权表示高兴，并准备通过给予印度尼西亚“援助”的方式渗入印度尼西亚。
    这家电台广播的安塔拉通讯社驻华盛顿记者所写的这一条消息说：“印度尼西亚国内局势的发展，给了美国以恢复同印度尼西亚之间的合作的需要。看来，美国也准备在一切方面援助印度尼西亚。”
    消息说，美国参议院外交委员会最近讨论了一九六七年度美国的“援外方案”，包括向印度尼西亚提供“援助”的问题。美国国务卿腊斯克在会上发表讲话说，美国必须“援助”印度尼西亚。腊斯克还回顾说，“两年前，由于印度尼西亚政局的关系（编者按：指印度尼西亚对抗新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”），美国停止了对印度尼西亚的经济援助。”
    据雅加达电台报道，为了乞求美“援”，由右派军人政权派遣的一个政府代表团已于十二日到达纽约。这是右派军人政权宣布成立后派往美国的第一个官方代表团。
    印度尼西亚副总理哈孟库·布沃诺六日在合作国会全体会议上就国内经济问题发表声明时曾经透露：右派军人政权同美国已经达成一致的意见：关于美“援”的谈判将由这个政权同美国驻印度尼西亚大使在雅加达举行。他在谈到印度尼西亚急需日本和西方国家的贷款时说：“我国经济的恢复和稳定很需要这样的贷款”。
