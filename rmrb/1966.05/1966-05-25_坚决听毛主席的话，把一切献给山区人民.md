    Resolutely Listen to Chairman Mao's Words and Dedicate Everything to the People of the Mountainous Areas
    Chairman Mao says it this way, we do it this way; Chairman Mao instructs it this way, we execute it this way. Study Chairman Mao's works, learn one, remember one, and never let it go once remembered; learn one, then use one, and use it to the very end.
    Xiao Funian, Salesman of Zong'ai Supply and Marketing Cooperative, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province
    Editor's Note: People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. The article written by Comrade Xiao Funian once again vividly and powerfully proves this truth.
    Xiao Funian carried a shoulder pole and worked in the deep mountains of Shouyang County for ten years with a fiery red heart. Whatever the masses needed, he provided; what the masses had not thought of, he proactively thought of and provided for the masses. He is not only an excellent salesman, but also an excellent production organizer, and an excellent arranger of the masses' lives. In this ordinary yet important position, difficulties cannot defeat him, honors cannot hold back his progress, and ridicule and mockery cannot shake his determination. The poor and lower-middle peasants made the following assessment of him: a confidant of the people in the mountainous areas.
    "Chairman Mao says it this way, we do it this way."
    "Learn one, then use one, and use it to the very end." This most profound and fundamental realization of Xiao Funian has enabled him to reach a selfless level in the process of serving the people.
    "Chairman Mao's books and Chairman Mao's words are so good, why am I only learning and using them myself and not introducing them to the people of the mountainous areas? This shows that my mass viewpoint is not complete or thorough enough." From most resolutely and thoroughly acting in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought to helping the masses learn Mao Zedong Thought, an ordinary salesman became a conscious disseminator of Mao Zedong Thought. Some of the masses are illiterate, so Xiao Funian takes the time to study with them; some people lack money to buy books, so Xiao Funian mobilizes them to collect sour dates and tree seeds to save money to buy books. Caring both about improving the lives of the masses and about raising the consciousness of the masses, Xiao Funian has reached a new realm in his work of serving the masses.
    I just turned fifty this year, but the shoulder pole has been pressing on my shoulders for nearly forty years. On this shoulder pole of mine, there is not only endless bitterness but also inexhaustible joy.
    From the time I can remember, my family was so poor that we often couldn't make ends meet. As soon as I got rid of my open-crotch pants, I herded cattle and pigs for the landlord, cut grass, and gathered firewood. At the age of sixteen, I left my hometown of Xinxian and became an apprentice in a grocery store in Zong'ai Town, Shouyang. In the old society, being an apprentice meant being a beast of burden for the capitalists. It was not until the liberation of my hometown in 1948 that I turned over. In January 1956, I transferred to work in the supply and marketing cooperative, and because I worked relatively well, I was successively selected as an advanced worker at the county, district, and provincial levels. Especially in 1959, comrades all said that I had "four happy events," referring to attending the National Conference of Heroes, participating in the National Day observation ceremony in the capital, personally seeing our great leader Chairman Mao, and joining the great Chinese Communist Party. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, it's like two worlds, two different skies. How could I not be happy, how could I not be revolutionary!
    The leaders asked me to talk about my work experience. What can I say? Water has a source, trees have roots, and everything comes down to one principle: Chairman Mao says it this way, we do it this way; Chairman Mao instructs it this way, we execute it this way. I have no education, and I haven't studied Chairman Mao's works much, but I learn one, remember one, and never let it go once remembered; learn one, then use one, and use it to the very end. If you want to talk about experience, that's it.
            The More Remote the Mountain Village, the More We Must Go
    The area I serve is the Shuangfeng Mountain area bordering Yuxian County, including six production brigades and twenty-five natural villages. Some comrades say that the characteristics of this area are: one mountain, two far, three poor, four small, five scattered. One mountain, meaning it's all mountainous area; two far, meaning it's far away, a trip is dozens of li; three poor, meaning the place is poor, with low yields and low income; four small, meaning they are all small villages; five scattered, meaning the residences are very scattered, three families here, two households there. Because of this, some people are unwilling to go. Their saying is: "The suffering is not small, but the profits are not big." I think this saying is right for businessmen in the old society, but we are socialist commerce, not doing business to make money. Chairman Mao said: Developing the economy and ensuring supply is the general policy of our financial and economic work. Chairman Mao also said: Serving the people wholeheartedly and proceeding from the interests of the people in everything, this is our starting point. How can we be afraid of hardship and fatigue and simply consider making more money? I resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, and for the past ten years, I have insisted on traveling in these mountain villages, using a shoulder pole and eight ropes to carry the means of production and means of livelihood needed by the people in the mountainous areas, one load after another, to the team, to the land, to the household; and then collect the agricultural and sideline products that the people in the mountainous areas want to sell, door to door, one load after another, back home. The more inconvenient the place, the more I want to go, the busier the masses, the happier I run.
    The Yangmo Temple Brigade only has sixteen households, behind Shuangfeng Mountain, twenty li away from the store where I am. The road is very difficult to walk uphill, not to mention carrying a load of hundreds of catties, even an empty-handed person has to sweat all over to make the trip. The more I go to this kind of place every two or three days, from plows, seeders, and rollers to needles and thread, I carry everything to deliver to them. Once last year, commune member Nie Shuanxiao and I were chatting, and he said he wanted to ask for leave to go to Zong'ai. I asked him what he was going to do, but he didn't say. Later, I learned from others that he wanted to buy an iron warming pot. This thing weighed thirty-eight catties and was only worth five yuan. If he went to buy it himself, he was afraid of delaying work; if he told me, he was a little embarrassed. When I learned about this situation, I carried one to him the next day. When Shuanxiao saw it, he was so excited that he didn't know what to say for a long time. I quickly comforted him: "What's the big deal! It's sixty li round trip for you, and you'll have to miss a day's work. I just brought it along, see if you like it, if you don't, we can exchange it." Shuanxiao said: "My Lao Xiao, even if you brought a stone, I wouldn't know how to thank you, let alone say whether I like it or not!"
    One evening last spring, I had just returned from going village to village when the Shangjiazhai Brigade called and said that they were going to plant millet the next day, and asked us to prepare one hundred catties of 666 powder and thirteen catties of seed-mixing wine, saying that they would send someone to pick it up at dawn. I thought, since they needed it so urgently, and they were so busy right now, how could I let the production team send someone! Thinking of this, I shouldered my shoulder pole again and delivered these things overnight. When the cadres of Shangjiazhai saw me, they said: "Lao Xiao, why are you in such a hurry?" I said: "Soldiers and horses have not moved, but food and grass must go first. The 'front line' is in such a hurry, how dare I, this 'logistics soldier,' delay?" One sentence made everyone laugh.
    Some people say: "Lao Xiao is a fool. People sit in the department store, not afraid of the wind in winter, not afraid of the sun in summer, and still do business; he just can't leave that shoulder pole, and looks for his own suffering." I say: it depends on what point of view you look at the problem. If it is for the individual, to support the family and make a living, then you feel that carrying a shoulder pole is a bitter thing, suffering; if it is for the revolution, for the people, you will feel that carrying a shoulder pole is the need of the Party, the need of the revolution, the need of the people in the mountainous areas. For the people, for the revolution, I am willing to be such a "fool" and carry a shoulder pole for a lifetime. Therefore, as long as it is the need of the people in the mountainous areas, no matter the size of the village, no matter how far the road, no matter how good or bad the weather, no matter how light or heavy the goods, and no matter whether it is my business or not, whether there is a profit or not, I always carry them diligently and quickly, and do not delay the need.
          Choose the Biggest Difficulties, Carry the Heaviest Burdens
    The Shuangfeng Mountain area is all dry, sandy loess land, which originally had low yields and low income. In recent years, there has been a continuous drought, so the production and lives of the masses have suffered temporary but relatively serious difficulties. Especially in the Shangjiazhai Brigade, grain yields were even lower. One year after the autumn harvest distribution, the team had very little cash left, and there was no source for production funds for the coming year. I saw the difficulties brought to Shangjiazhai by the natural disaster, kept them in my heart, and always wanted to think of a good way to help them overcome the difficulties. Later, I saw in Chairman Mao's books: the more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is the good comrade. Chairman Mao also taught us to choose the heaviest burdens to carry. Chairman Mao's instructions reminded me, yes, I should live in Shangjiazhai, share weal and woe with my class brothers, and work together to overcome difficulties. Soon, the Party branch approved my application, and from March 1960, I carried my peddler's pole to work in the Shangjiazhai store.
    After arriving in Shangjiazhai, I first conducted door-to-door investigations, held discussions with cadres and commune members, and then suggested holding a Party branch meeting to discuss the great plan to overcome difficulties. At that time, the emotions of some Party members were not good enough either. I said: Chairman Mao taught us long ago, "We must recognize difficulties, analyze difficulties, and fight against difficulties." In the past, when fighting enemies and making revolution, there was always the danger of losing our heads, and we had to do it even with such great difficulties. Can the current temporary difficulties scare us? I came here to be stationed in the team according to Chairman Mao's instructions to overcome difficulties with everyone... Hearing me say this, everyone unanimously said that they would be determined to overcome difficulties. After the meeting, Party members mobilized the masses separately to prepare for next year's production. I ran around looking for ways to develop sideline production. Soon, more than ten kinds of sideline production were launched, such as burning charcoal, making woodenware, making wipes, raising pigs, raising chickens, and raising rabbits. In one year, the average income per household reached one hundred yuan. The development of sideline production provided funds for agriculture, and agriculture also achieved better harvests. Shangjiazhai, the poorest brigade, finally became prosperous year after year.
    While helping the collective develop sideline production, I also focused on helping the poor and lower-middle peasants develop household sideline production. Poor old woman Zheng Sanni was a lonely old woman who had lost her labor power. I thought, helping the old woman raise a few chickens was still possible. So I mobilized her to hatch chicks. She said: "Good my Chou Sanli (Chou San is my nickname, people of the older generation here call me that), as the saying goes, to catch a mouse, you have to have a piece of oily rope, I have no chickens, no eggs, how can I hatch chicks!" I said: As long as you are willing to raise them, I will help you with the chickens and eggs. The old woman said: "I couldn't be happier to do such a good thing." I carried goods to the Dongguang Brigade and found that Wang Lihe's family had four hens brooding, so I borrowed one from him, and from the eggs I had collected, I selected twenty good breeds and delivered them to the old woman's house. As a result, sixteen chicks hatched from the twenty eggs, and last year she sold more than thirty catties of eggs alone, earning more than twenty yuan.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution." The poor and lower-middle peasants are the pillars of socialist construction in the countryside. I believe that sincerely and wholeheartedly serving the poor and lower-middle peasants is also serving the revolution.
      Embrace a Revolutionary World, Go Wherever Needed
    Anyone who has been to our store will find a strange phenomenon, that is, we are business personnel of the Zong'ai Supply and Marketing Cooperative, but we serve four brigades of the Jiechou Commune. How is this going?
    After I settled in Shangjiazhai in 1960, the masses of several brigades near Shangjiazhai in the Jiechou Commune often came to Shangjiazhai to buy and sell things. I asked them: Why do you run so far to buy and sell things? They replied: "It's much closer than going to Jiechou." I said: Doesn't the Jiechou Supply and Marketing Cooperative send anyone to your place? Asking this stirred up a "hornet's nest." This one said this, that one said that, opinions were endless. I thought, these places are even more remote than Shangjiazhai, and it's even more inconvenient for the masses to buy and sell things. The Party educated us that all people in the world are one family, and serving the people is unlimited. Why worry about regional boundaries, if others don't go, I will take on this burden. I didn't expect that going a few times would cause trouble. Some comrades in the Jiechou Supply and Marketing Cooperative said: Xiao Funian is really a grasshopper from Henan, eating over the border. So they went to the county to say that I had stolen their business. The county specially sent people to investigate, and the cadres and masses were all angry when they heard it. They said, how can there be such a reason in the world, they dislike being poor and suffering and don't come, and they don't let others come, they are really occupying the latrine without shitting, let them go and complain, we just have to have Lao Xiao! At the unanimous request of the cadres and masses, the county made a decision: the four brigades of Yangmo Temple, Shuerling, Jianzui, and Baozi still belong to the Jiechou Commune administratively, but the supply and marketing business belongs to Xiao Funian.
    (Editor's Note: "Occupying the latrine without shitting" is very wrong. If you don't serve the people well yourself, why don't you let others come to serve the people? Comrade Xiao Funian's initiative to actively serve the people regardless of regional boundaries is a very noble revolutionary quality. In addition, another problem can be seen from here, that is, the scope of purchase and sales of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives should also be divided according to economic regions. Since these four production brigades of the Jiechou Commune are far from the Jiechou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and close to Shangjiazhai, they should be assigned to the Shangjiazhai Supply and Marketing Cooperative for supply).
    The leaders and the masses trust me so much, which is a great encouragement and also a spur to me. If I don't do a good job, how can I be worthy of the trust of the leaders and the hearts of the class brothers in the mountainous areas! Therefore, the more I work, the more energetic I am, and I always want to worry about them, do my best, and sweat as much as possible, and only then do I feel happy.
    The Yangmo Temple Brigade has a wide area and a sparse population, and has always been characterized by extensive planting and low yields. Last year, after I went to Dazhai to visit, I publicized to them the construction of Dazhai fields, learning the "three deep" experience (ie, deep plowing, deep planting, and deep hoeing), and mobilized them to buy mountain plows to implement deep plowing. Unexpectedly, some commune members simply did not believe it, so I specially carried a mountain plow back from the Zong'ai farm tool factory and called on cadres and commune members to conduct a comparison test between the mountain plow and the old plow in the field. As the saying goes, don't be afraid of not knowing the goods, just be afraid of comparing goods, after a comparison, people saw that the mountain plow plowed deeper and more evenly, and everyone present praised it unanimously. At this time, I also discovered that they were lubricating the "wok-type car" with sesame oil; half of the oil flowed away, which was a great waste. I asked them: Why don't you buy black oil to grease the car? They said: "Buying black oil costs money, and sesame oil is produced by ourselves, which can be done without spending money." I said: You have calculated the account wrong. One catty of black oil can top two catties of sesame oil, and selling one catty of sesame oil can buy three catties of black oil, how much should be saved inside and out. They were all stunned when they heard this. The next day, I carried the mountain plow on one side and the black oil on the other to deliver to them. I bought the goods without cash, so I opened a check, turned to the Jiechou Credit Cooperative to withdraw the money, and sent it to the Zong'ai Machinery Factory. Running back and forth for one hundred and fifty li, I lost a full three days of time, which was neither my business nor had any profit. Therefore, some people said: "The way you do this, you really have a house and don't worry about losing the land." I said: As long as I can help the poor brothers develop production, I am willing to give up my wife and children.
          Completely for the People, Thoroughly for the People
    Once, I was carrying my load to Dongguang when I happened to meet Wang Cheng, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, who looked at my load and said: "Lao Xiao, people are selling sewing machines and bicycles, a transaction is more than one hundred yuan; you are a needle, a thread, sauce, vinegar, alkali, and flour, a mess of everything, I think you've made the business rusty." I said: Lao Wang, you are wrong to say that. I ask you: If you buy a sewing machine, can you do without a needle? If you have a bicycle and the valve is broken, can you ride it? If you make new clothes, can you wear them without buttons? Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people completely and thoroughly, whatever the people need, we will carry it, how can we consider the size of the business, how much money to make? When I said this, Lao Wang laughed, and he said: "What you think is right, what you do is right, is to resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's words, this is truly serving the people."
    Indeed, looking at my load, the lazy can't carry it, the good can't leave it, there are more than one hundred varieties, the price is not worth thirty yuan, but the mountain masses can't do without that thing. Last spring, an epidemic broke out in the Shuangfeng Mountain area, so I went back to the Zong'ai Hospital to consult the doctor, and since then, my load has increased by fifty-three kinds of prepared medicines such as sulfonamides, baking soda, and Lianqiao Detoxification Pills. Prevention for the healthy, treatment for the sick, not much money is spent, but a lot of things are done, and the masses feel very convenient. Later I thought: I carry so many piglets to the masses, it is inevitable that some will get sick, so I contacted the veterinary station again, and the load was increased with prepared medicines such as "Cure Pig Spirit" and "Treat Pig Powder." When pigs have diarrhea, catch a cold, or refuse to eat, give them some medicine in time, and they will get better after eating.
    Last year, the superiors also called for a large-scale development of rabbit raising. I went to Shangjiazhai to find out that there were only thirty-three female rabbits and not a single male rabbit. How can we develop with a female and no male? So I always paid attention to finding male rabbits, and later recovered six from Ansheng and Yangmo Temple. I built a nest myself and fed them. The young people joked with me: "Lao Xiao has also set up a breeding station." Soon, borrowing rabbits also became famous. People from other communes also came to mate. The six male rabbits were almost never at home every day. There were also some poor households who wanted to raise rabbits, but they didn't even have female rabbits, so I temporarily lent them the female rabbits I had collected to develop them, and then sent the female rabbits back after they gave birth to baby rabbits. In this way, the number of rabbits quickly developed to one thousand six hundred.
    I roll around with the class brothers in the mountainous areas every day, and I have the most contact with their actual problems and personal difficulties, and I have the deepest understanding. Therefore, I always treat their affairs as my affairs and overcome their difficulties as my own difficulties. And every time I do something, I have to use the high standard of "complete" and "thorough" to demand myself. For example, if someone gets sick, I will go to the health station and hospital to ask a doctor for him; after seeing a doctor, I will get medicine for him; if one place doesn't have all the medicine, I will run to several places; postal workers don't often go to mountain villages, so I will send letters, mail parcels, and remit money for them; if the shoes of cattle and sheep workers are broken, I will take them to Zong'ai to be nailed and then send them back; when the public debt numbers are announced, I will carry the numbers with me and exchange them door to door, and if anyone wins, I will go to the bank to get them back, etc. Living in this place, it takes dozens of li to get a haircut, and commune members miss a lot of work. Later, I bought a razor myself and carried it with me, and wherever I go, I act as a volunteer barber whenever I have time. Although my skills are not strong, it saves both work and money and is very popular with the masses. In short, whatever I can do, I will never let the masses miss work and run around, so people gave me the nickname—Wideranger. In fact, these are just things I do along the way, and they don't affect my main business at all.
    Some people say: "Xiao Funian specializes in operating small commodities, doing small businesses, and doing small things." I said, it depends on how you say it. If it is in a city or a place with convenient transportation, these are indeed small commodities, small businesses, and small things, but for the area I run to and the objects I serve, they are big commodities, big businesses, and big things. It is a small thing for me to take on these things and do them, but if each household does them, they become big things again; besides, since the people in the mountainous areas cannot do without these small commodities, small businesses, and small things, they have become my big things.
          Send Mao Zedong Thought to the People of the Mountainous Areas
    Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, my revolutionary consciousness is constantly improving, and my work is getting smoother and smoother. I thought, Chairman Mao's books and Chairman Mao's words are so good, why am I only learning and using them myself and not introducing them to the people of the mountainous areas? This shows that my mass viewpoint is not complete or thorough enough. I realized this and was determined to send Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the mountainous areas. Last May, I went to Taiyuan to participate in the representative meeting of activists in industry, transportation, finance, and trade. The meeting organized us to visit the exhibition of Liao Chujiang, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zushi studying Chairman Mao's works. I was very moved after seeing the exhibition and hearing the explanation. At that time, I thought that it would be sure to mobilize the people by publicizing the study deeds of these three comrades when I went back. When I walked out of the door, I bought five hanging pictures and also bought fifty copies of the three pamphlets "Serve the People", "In Memory of Bethune", and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains", and carried them on my load, and wherever I went, I promoted them. Chairman Mao's books are really attractive, and people can't bear to let go of them when they see them. This one wants it, that one wants it. Seeing that the people in the mountainous areas love Chairman Mao's works so much, I carry them to them in large quantities.
    But after the books were delivered, some people wanted to buy them but didn't have money. I thought, selling books also had to combine purchase and sales. So I started a barter business again. Eggs can be exchanged, rabbits can be exchanged, and waste products can be exchanged, as long as you buy red books, whatever you have, you can exchange for them. But some people are not well-off. I calculated that three and a half taels of sour dates could buy a pamphlet. There are plenty of sour dates in these places, so I carried the red books to the fields and, during their rest time, mobilized them to collect sour dates. In this way, more than one hundred catties of sour dates were exchanged in a few days.
    The young people of Yangtouzhai wanted to set up a cultural room, and the League branch secretary Zhao Daiying asked me to help him think of a way, so I asked him to mobilize the young people to collect vinegar willow seeds in their spare time. In three to five days, they collected thirty catties and sold them for eighteen yuan, and bought red books worth twelve yuan and nine jiao. In this way, Chairman Mao's books were pushed open in large quantities. By the end of last November, more than five hundred and thirty books had been sold, and three hundred and thirty revolutionary propaganda paintings had also been sold.
    The power of Chairman Mao's works is really great. The masses said: Old people become younger after learning them, young people become red-hearted after learning them, men become more energetic after learning them, and women become more diligent after learning them. Jia Jincai, a seventy-nine-year-old poor peasant in Yangtouzhai, asked someone to read "In Memory of Bethune" and "Serve the People" to him, and his class consciousness was greatly improved. Not only did he insist on being on time, but he also became the "Wideranger" of the team. The cadres and commune members of Shuerling learned "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and were determined to change the old habit of extensive planting and low yields, and built one hundred and fifty mu of Dazhai fields in one winter and one spring.
    After the activities of studying Chairman Mao's works were launched, some illiterate people were also anxious to learn, so I mobilized literate people to help them, and I also took time to study with them. While I read, I also combined revolutionary stories and good deeds to publicize Mao Zedong Thought.
    I am a Communist Party member, and I am doing revolution. It is my responsibility to send Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the mountainous areas. Some time ago, the Jinzhong Xinhua Bookstore held a on-site meeting in Shouyang and asked me to introduce my experience. I said to everyone: "I really don't have any experience, I just have an idea: Chairman Mao's books are the true scriptures of revolution, whoever learns them will make revolution, and they are effective wherever they are used. I myself must be determined to learn well, and I also have the responsibility to help the people of the mountainous areas learn well."
        Do Revolution for a Lifetime, Learn from Advanced People for a Lifetime
    Under the education of the Party and the support of the masses, I have done a little work in my own capacity, but the leaders and the masses have given me very high honors. I keep in mind and often warn myself: All achievements, merits, and honors, and even I, Xiao Funian, were salvaged from the sea of bitterness by the Party and Chairman Mao; without the Party and without the revolution, there would be none of what I have now. Therefore, I have no reason to be complacent, let alone rely on the old and sell the old, and sleep on my laurels, but must resolutely act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions that "modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people lag behind", and live to old age, work to old age, and learn to old age. Do revolution for a lifetime, learn Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, and learn from advanced people for a lifetime.
    Because of this, I read Chairman Mao's works every day. After a day of traveling in the villages, I always have to turn on the oil lamp to read for a while after returning at night. If I don't read, I feel like I've lost something. And wherever I go, whatever I do, I always seize every opportunity to learn from advanced people. I found that all advanced people, although they have their own specialties, are all good at learning and using Mao Zedong Thought in the final analysis. Learning from advanced people with an open mind is also learning from them how to flexibly learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. With this understanding, learning from advanced people is even more open-minded and sincere.
    Last September, I took the opportunity to participate in the provincial finance and trade department's "Five Good" enterprises and "Six Good" employee representative meeting, and visited Comrades Lü Guirong, Zhang Guizhi, and Fan Lingxiu. After listening to their introductions, I felt that in the most important issue of flexibly learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, young people surpass old people, and one generation surpasses another! If I don't catch up quickly and learn from them, I will lag behind. In particular, after hearing the experience of the Zhaige Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fushan County, I deeply felt that this cooperative is a living example of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have learned the best and implemented the best the general policy of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" formulated by Chairman Mao himself. Therefore, I visited several times during the meeting breaks to learn from them. Last March, I personally went to Zhaige to visit and study. After looking in the mirror and finding the gaps, I discovered many weaknesses in my work. For example, in organizing the development of diversified operations, they support the collective more, and I focus on individuals more; they focus on complete sets more, and I focus on fragments more; they focus on both the present and the long-term, combining short and long, and I pay attention to the current, ignore the long-term, and have more short-term than long-term.
    After returning from Zhaige, I conveyed the experience to all employees of the cooperative and, under the direct guidance and help of the leaders, made specific plans and decided to take large planting and large breeding as breakthroughs to comprehensively learn from, catch up with, and surpass Zhaige. Our Shuerling Brigade is not worthy of its name, and there is not even a single tree. Last year, we helped plant a total of more than 4,900 walnut, red date, pear, and apple trees. People happily said: "If we keep doing this for a few years, it will become a real Shuerling." Yangtouzhai Brigade is the resident of my store (I moved here from Shangjiazhai in the spring of 1965). Last year, we helped plant a fruit tree ditch, a pear tree ditch, a thirty-mu apricot tree ditch, and a jujube tree slope, and a walnut tree mouth. The local people wanted to grow peppercorns but had no technology, so I asked the director of the Xucun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Heshun County to help cultivate one mu of seedlings. In just one year, more than 14,000 various fruit trees were planted (excluding apricot trees and peppercorns), and dangshen, niuxi, and rehmannia were also planted.
    Learning from Zhang Guizhi's experience of making a big fuss in Huaguoshan, I felt that although I also lived in the mountains, the utilization of the mountains was not enough. Last year, I proposed the suggestion of digging Shuangfeng Mountain in a big way. In order to find out the resources in the mountains, Comrade Wang Changgui, the instructor of our cooperative, and I went into the mountains to investigate together. We drilled through ditches and climbed slopes during the day and lived in cowsheds at night. After running for five or six days, we finally discovered many new varieties, and then mobilized commune members to go to the mountains to collect them in large quantities. The number of varieties purchased increased by thirty-two compared with the previous year, and more than 8,000 yuan was dug out of the mountains in one autumn. Coupled with other sideline income, the average income per household in the six brigades I served reached 120 yuan, an increase of 40 yuan compared with the previous year.
    Not only should we learn from the famous advanced units and advanced individuals in the province, but we should also learn from whoever has advanced experience. Li Guoxin, a salesman at the Mengshan Branch of the Dazhai Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xiyang County, and Ma Bianhua of the Niucun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuxian County, had both learned from me in the past. They were very modest and said they were my apprentices. In fact, they have always been helping and learning from each other, and learning from each other's strengths. In the past two years, young people have made rapid progress, so I went to Mengshan to study from Comrade Li Guoxin by following up on labor, to learn advanced experience in serving the poor and lower-middle peasants and organizing knitting production. Since last year, I have been concentrating on learning from Ma Bianhua's experience in supplying construction sites, and the results have been very good.
    My experience is that as long as you are really learning for the revolution and surpassing for the revolution, first study politics, study ideology, study style, flexibly learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, then you will feel that there are advanced people everywhere, and you can use it after learning it.
    Some of the work I have done under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is far from the requirements of the Party and the masses. I will work harder to read Chairman Mao's books, resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and dedicate everything to the Party, to the revolution, and to the people of the mountainous areas.

专栏：

    坚决听毛主席的话，把一切献给山区人民
    毛主席怎个说，咱就怎个做，毛主席怎个指示，咱就怎个执行。学习毛主席著作，学一条，记一条，记住就死不放；学一条，就用一条，用就用到底。
    山西省寿阳县宗艾供销社营业员　萧富年
    编者按：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。营业员萧富年同志写的这篇文章，再一次生动、有力地证明了这个真理。
    萧富年扛着一条扁担，怀着一颗火热的红心，在寿阳县的深山里工作了十年。群众需要什么，他就作什么；群众没有想到的，他主动为群众想到、作到。他既是一个优秀的营业员，又是一个优秀的生产组织者，还是一个优秀的群众生活的安排者。在这个平凡而重要的岗位上，困难难不倒他，荣誉拖不住他前进的脚步，奚落嘲讽动摇不了他的决心。贫下中农为他作了鉴定：山区群众的贴心人。
    “毛主席怎个说，咱就怎个做。”
    “学一条，就用一条，用就用到底。”萧富年的这个最深刻、最根本的觉悟，使他在为人民服务的过程中，达到了忘我的程度。
    “毛主席的书、毛主席的话这样好，我为啥光是自己学、自己用，而不介绍给山区人民呢？这说明自己的群众观点还不完全、不彻底。”从自己最坚决、最彻底地按照毛泽东思想办事，到帮助群众学习毛泽东思想，一个普通的营业员，成为一个自觉的毛泽东思想传播者。有些群众不认字，萧富年抽时间同他们一起学；有些人缺钱买书，萧富年发动他们打酸枣、采树籽，攒钱买书。既关心群众生活的改善，又关心群众觉悟的提高，萧富年在为群众服务的工作中，达到了一个新的境界。
    今年我刚满五十岁，可是扁担在我肩膀上就压了近四十年。在我的这条扁担上，既有吐不尽的苦水，更有说不完的欢乐。
    从我能记事起，家里就穷得经常揭不开锅。我刚脱掉开裆裤，就给地主家放牛放猪，割草打柴。十六岁上，离开忻县老家，到寿阳宗艾镇一家杂货铺里当学徒。在旧社会，当学徒就是给资本家当牛作马。一九四八年家乡解放，我这才翻了身。一九五六年一月转到供销社工作，因为工作得比较好，先后被评选为县、专、省的先进工作者。特别是一九五九年，同志们都说我是“四喜临门”，指的是出席了全国群英会，参加了首都国庆观礼，亲眼看到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席，还加入了伟大的中国共产党。想过去，比现在，两个世界两层天，我怎能不高兴，怎能不革命！
    领导让我谈谈工作经验。说什么呢？水有源，树有根，九九归一一本经，就是毛主席怎个说，咱就怎个做，毛主席怎个指示，咱就怎个执行。咱没文化，毛主席著作学得不多，可是学一条，记一条，记住就死不放；学一条，就用一条，用就用到底。要说经验，就这么一条。
            越是偏僻的山庄越要去
    我所服务的地区，是和盂县交界的双风山一带，包括六个生产大队，二十五个自然村。有的同志说，这个地区的特点是：一山，二远，三穷，四小，五分散。一山，是全是山区；二远，是路远，跑一趟就是几十里；三穷，是地方穷，产量低，收入少；四小，全是些小村；五分散，就是居住十分分散，这里三家，那里两户。正因为这样，有些人就不愿意去。他们的说法是：“受苦不小，油水不大。”我想，这说法，对旧社会的买卖人来说是对劲的，可是，我们是社会主义的商业，不是为了赚钱才做生意。毛主席说：发展经济，保障供给，是我们财经工作的总方针。毛主席还说：全心全意为人民服务，一切从人民利益出发，这就是我们的出发点。我们怎能怕苦怕累，单纯考虑多赚钱？我坚决听毛主席的话，十年来就一直坚持在这些山庄小村里转，用一条扁担八股绳，把山区人民需要的生产资料和生活资料，一担一担地送到队，送到地，送到户；再把山区人民要出售的农副产品，挨门逐户地收起来，一担一担地担回来。越是不方便的地方我越要去，群众越忙我越跑得欢。
    羊摩寺大队只有十六户人家，在双风山背后，离我在的购销店足有二十里。一路爬坡，路很难走，不用说担上上百斤重的担子，就是空行人走一趟也得满身放汗。这样的地方，我越是三天两头就去一趟，大至犁、耧、砘耙，小至一针一线，我都担上给他们送去。去年有一次，社员聂拴小和我闲聊之中，说他想请假下一趟宗艾。我问他去干什么，他不说。后来，我从别人嘴里了解到他想买个铁温罐。这家伙有三十八斤重，只值五元钱。他自己去买吧，怕误工；跟我说吧，又有点不好意思。我了解到这个情况，第二天就担了一个给他送去。拴小一见，激动得好半天不知道说什么好。我赶紧安慰他：“这有啥！你去一趟往返六十里，总得误一个工。我这是捎办，你看称心不称心吧，不称心咱还可以换。”拴小说：“我的老萧啊，你就是担来块石头，我也不知道该怎么谢你才好，还说什么称心不称心！”
    去年春天一个晚上，我刚串乡回来，尚家寨大队打来个电话，说第二天要种谷，让我们准备一百斤六六六粉，十三斤拌种酒，说是天明就派人来取。我想，既然用得这样急，眼下又是这样忙，怎么能让生产队派人来！想到这里，我就又担起扁担，连夜把这些东西给送去了。尚家寨的干部们一见我，就说：“老萧，你咋这样性急？”我说：“兵马未动，粮草先行嘛。‘前线’上用得这样急，我这‘后勤兵’怎敢耽误？”一句话说得大伙都笑了。
    有些人说：“老萧是个傻瓜。人家坐在门市部，冬天不怕风吹，夏天不怕日晒，照样做了买卖；他就硬是离不开那条扁担，自己找着受那份洋罪。”我说：这要看拿什么观点看问题，如果是为了个人，为了养家糊口混饭吃，那就觉得担扁担是苦事情，受洋罪；如果是为了革命，为了人民，你就会感觉到担扁担是党的需要，革命的需要，山区人民的需要。为了人民，为了革命，我就心甘情愿当这样的“傻瓜”，担一辈子扁担。所以，只要是山区人民的需要，不管村庄大小，不管道路远近，不管天气好坏，不管商品轻重，也不管算不算我的业务，有没有利润，我都是勤担快跑，不误需要。
          困难拣大的　担子挑重的
    双风山一带，全都是些干沙圪梁地，本来就产量低，收入少，前几年，又连续大旱，所以群众的生产和生活遭受了暂时的、但却是比较严重的困难。尤其是尚家寨大队，粮食产量更低，有一年秋收分配以后，队里留下的现金很少，来年生产资金没有着落。天灾给尚家寨带来的困难，我看在眼里，记在心里，总想思谋个好办法来帮助他们克服困难。后来，我从毛主席的书里看到：越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。毛主席还教导我们，担子要拣重的挑。毛主席的指示一下把我给提醒啦，对，我应该住到尚家寨去，同阶级兄弟同甘共苦，一道去战胜困难。不久，党支部批准了我的申请，从一九六○年三月份，我便挑着货郎担到尚家寨购销店工作。
    到尚家寨以后，我首先逐户进行调查，找干部、社员座谈，接着又建议召开党支部会，共商克服困难的大计。当时，有的党员的情绪也不够好。我就说：毛主席早就教导我们，“要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”过去打敌人闹革命，随时都有脑袋搬家的危险，困难那么大都要干，现在的这点暂时困难就能把我们吓倒？我来咱们这里驻队，就是按毛主席的指示来同大家一起战胜困难的……。听我这么一说，大家一致表示，要下定决心，战胜困难。会后，党员们分头动员群众，张罗来年生产。我就跑出去四处寻找副业生产门路。不久，就开展了烧木炭、制木器、做擦子、养猪、养鸡、养兔等十多种副业生产。一年时间，每户平均收入达一百元。副业生产发展，为农业提供了资金，农业也取得了较好收成。尚家寨这个最穷的大队，终于一年一年地兴旺起来啦。
    在帮助集体发展副业生产的同时，我又重点去帮助贫下中农发展家庭副业。贫农老大娘郑三妮，是个失去了劳动力的孤寡老太太。我想，帮助老人家养几只鸡还是可以的。我就动员她孵小鸡。她说：“好俺丑三哩（丑三是我的奶名，这里上年岁的人都是这样叫我），俗话说，打老鼠还得有根油焾焾，咱一没鸡，二没蛋，怎么个孵小鸡！”我说：只要你愿意养，鸡和蛋我帮助你。老人家说：“这样的好事，俺还有不愿意的。”我担货去东光大队，发现王利和家里有四只落窝鸡，我就向他借了一只，又从我收下的蛋中，拣了二十个优种，一起给老人送到家里。结果二十个蛋孵出十六个小鸡，去年光蛋就卖了三十多斤，收入二十多元。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”贫下中农是农村建设社会主义的台柱子，我认为，诚心诚意为贫下中农服务，也就是为革命服务。
      胸怀革命大天地　哪里需要去哪里
    凡是去过我们购销店的同志，都会发现这样一个奇怪的现象，就是我们是宗艾供销社的业务人员，却为解愁公社的四个大队服务。这是怎回事呢？
    一九六○年我去尚家寨落户以后，解愁公社靠近尚家寨的几个大队的群众，经常不断地来尚家寨买卖东西。我问他们：你们为甚跑这么远来买卖东西？他们回答说：“这比去解愁近的多哩。”我说：解愁供销社没人去你们那里吗？一问这个，就捅了“马蜂窝”啦，这个说长，那个道短，意见没个完。我想，这些地方比尚家寨还偏僻，群众买卖东西更不方便，党教育我们天下人民是一家，为人民服务是无限的，还管什么地区界限，别人不去，我就要把这个担子担起来。想不到我去跑了几趟，却惹下了麻烦。解愁供销社有的同志说：萧富年真是河南的蚂蚱，吃过交界来咧。于是就到县里，说我抢了他们的生意。县里专门派人来做调查，干部和群众一听都火了。他们说，天下哪有这样的道理，他们嫌穷嫌苦不来，还不让别人来，真是占住茅坑不拉屎，由他们去告吧，我们就是非要老萧不行！在干部和群众的一致要求下，县里做了个决定：羊摩寺、树儿岭、尖嘴、堡子这四个大队，行政区划仍属解愁公社，供销业务划归萧富年。
    （编者按：“占住茅坑不拉屎”，是很不对的。自己不好好为人民服务，为什么又不让别人来为人民服务呢？萧富年同志，不分地区界限积极为人民服务的主动精神是很高贵的革命品质。此外，从这里也可以看到另一个问题，就是基层供销社的购销范围，也应当按照经济区域划分。解愁公社这四个生产大队既然离解愁供销社远，离尚家寨近，就应当划归尚家寨供销社负责供应）。
    领导上和群众都是这样信任我，这对我既是很大的鼓励，也是个鞭策。我要是干不好，怎能对得住领导的信任，对得住山区阶级兄弟的这颗心！所以，我是越干越劲大，总想为他们操碎心，出尽力，流尽汗，心里才觉得痛快。
    羊摩寺大队地广人稀，历来是广种薄收。去年我去大寨参观回来，就向他们宣传建大寨田，学“三深”经验（即深耕、深种、深刨），并动员他们买山地犁实行深耕。不想有些社员硬是不相信，我就专门到宗艾农具厂担回一部，并叫上干部和社员，一同到地里进行山地犁和旧犁的对比试验。俗话说，不怕不识货，就怕货比货，一对比，人们看到山地犁耕得又深又匀，到场的人都是齐口称赞。这时，我又发现他们往“锅拍车”上膏油，用的是麻油；膏一半流一半，浪费很大。我就问他们：为啥不买点黑油膏车？他们说：“买黑油得花钱，麻油是自己产下的，不花钱就能办了事。”我说：你们把账算错了。一斤黑油可以顶二斤麻油用，而卖掉一斤麻油，可以买三斤黑油，一里一外该节省多少。他们一听都愣了。第二天我就一头担着山地犁，一头担上黑油给他们送去。买上东西没有现款，我又开上支票，拐到解愁信用社提出款来，送到宗艾机器厂。来来回回跑了一百五十里，误了可满三天时间，既不算我的业务，更没有分文利润，于是，有的人便说：“照你这样干，真是有房子不愁赔了地。”我说：只要能帮助穷兄弟们发展了生产，我就是贴上老婆娃娃也愿意。
          完全为人民　彻底为人民
    有一次，我担着担子到了东光，正好碰上大队党支部书记王成，他看了看我的担子便说：“老萧，人家是经营缝纫机、自行车，一笔买卖就是一百多元；你是一根针、一条线、酱醋碱面杂不烂，我看你把买卖做的生锈了。”我说：老王，你这就说的不对。我问你：买上缝纫机，没针行不行？有了自行车，坏了气门芯能走不能走？做上新衣裳，不缀扣子能穿不能穿？毛主席教育我们要完全为人民服务，要彻底为人民服务，人民需要啥咱就担啥，还能考虑业务大小、赚钱多少？我这么一说，老王笑了，他说：“你想的对，做的对，就是要坚决照毛主席的话办事，这才真正是为人民服务哩。”
    的确是，看我的担子，赖后生担不起，好后生走不了，论品种一百多，说价钱不值三十元，可是那宗那件山区群众也离不了。去年春天，双风山一带发生了一种流行病，我就回宗艾医院向医生请教，从此，我的担子又增加了磺胺、小苏打、羚翘解毒丸等五十三种成药。没病的预防，有病的治疗，花钱不多，办事不少，群众感到十分方便。后来我又想：我给群众担去那么多仔猪，难免也有生病的，于是，我就又和兽医站联系，担子上又增加了“治猪灵”、“疗猪散”等成药，碰到猪拉稀、感冒、不肯吃，及时给点药，一吃就好。
    去年上级又号召大量发展养兔，我去尚家寨一了解，只有三十三只母兔，没有一只公兔。有母的没公的怎发展？我就随时注意发现公兔，后来从安胜、羊摩寺收回六只，自己动手垒了个窝喂起来，谁家想配种就借给他，年轻人们和我开玩笑说：
  “老萧又办起配种站来了。”不久，借兔也出了名。外公社的也找来配，六只公兔几乎天天不在家。还有些贫困户，想养兔子，可连母兔也没有，我就把收下的母兔暂借给他们发展，等生下小兔再把母兔送回来。就这样，兔子就很快发展到一千六百只。
    我每天和山区的阶级弟兄们滚在一起，他们的实际问题，切身困难，我接触的最多，体会也最深，所以我总是把他们的事当我的事去办，把他们的困难当自己的困难去克服。而且每办一件事，都要拿“完全”“彻底”这个高标准来要求自己。比如，有人生了病，我就代他去保健站医院请医生；看了病再替他去抓药；一个地方抓不齐药，就跑它几个地方；邮政人员不经常到山庄小村，我就代他们寄信、邮包裹、汇兑款项；牛、羊工的鞋破了，我就拿上到宗艾给他们钉好再送去；兑公债的号码公布了，就随身带上号码，一家一户去兑，谁家中了就去银行给取回来等等。住在这地方，剃一回头都得跑几十里，社员误工多，后来我就自己掏钱买了把剃头刀随身带上，走到那里，一有空就当义务理发员。虽然手艺不强，但既省工又省钱，深受群众欢迎。总之，我能办了的事，就总不让群众去误工跑路，所以人们就给我送了个外号——揽得宽。其实这些都是捎带办了的事，一点也不影响我的正业。
    有人说：“萧富年就是专爱经营小商品，做小生意，办小事情。”我说，这要看怎说，如果是在城市，或者交通方便的地方，这些的确就是小商品、小生意、小事情，可是对我所跑的这个地区，我所服务的对象来说，它就是大商品、大生意、大事情。把这些事情我一个人揽起来去办，就是小事情，如果让一家一户去办，就又成了大事情；再说，既然山区人民离不了这些小商品、小生意、小事情，也就成了我的大事情。
          把毛泽东思想送给山区人民
    读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，我的革命觉悟不断提高，工作也越搞越顺当。我就想，毛主席的书、毛主席的话这样好，我为啥光是自己学、自己用，而不介绍给山区人民呢？这说明自己的群众观点还不完全、不彻底。我认识了这一点，就下定决心要把毛泽东思想送给山区人民。去年五月份，我去太原参加工交、财贸积极分子代表会，大会组织我们参观了廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示学习毛主席著作展览。看了展览，听了说明，很受感动。当时我就想，用这三位同志的学习事迹回去宣传发动保准行。走出门口，我就买了五幅挂图，还把《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》这三种单行本买了五十本，担在货担上，走到那里就宣传。毛主席的书吸引力真大，人们一看就舍不得松手了，这个也要，那个也要。看到山区人民这样热爱毛主席著作，我就大批给他们担。
    可是书送来了，有些人想买又缺钱。我想，卖书也得来个购销结合。于是我又开展了货换货的业务。鸡蛋可以换，兔儿可以换，废品也能换，只要买红书，有甚就换甚。可有些人手头不宽裕。我算了算，三两半酸枣的钱就能买一本单行本。这些地方有的是酸枣，我就把红书担到地里，趁他们休息时间，发动他们去打酸枣，这样一来，没几天就换下一百多斤酸枣。
    羊头寨的青年想办个文化室，团支书赵代英找我给他想办法，我就让他动员青年们利用工余时间去采醋柳籽。三五天时间就采下三十斤，卖下十八元，买了十二元九角钱的红书。就这样，毛主席的书大量推开了。到去年十一月底，已出售了五百三十多本，还卖了三百三十多张革命宣传画。
    毛主席著作的威力可真大，群众说：老年人学了变年轻，青年人学了红了心，男人学了添干劲，女人学了出了勤。羊头寨七十九岁的老贫农贾进财，请人给他读了《纪念白求恩》《为人民服务》，阶级觉悟大大提高，不仅坚持常出勤，而且变成队里的“管得宽”。树儿岭的干部社员学了《愚公移山》，立志改变广种薄收的老习惯，一冬一春建起大寨田一百五十亩。
    学习毛主席著作的活动开展起来以后，有些不识字的人也急着想学，我就动员识字的人去帮助他们，自己也抽时间和他们一块儿学习。我一边念，还结合讲革命故事和好人好事，宣传毛泽东思想。
    我是共产党员，是干革命的，把毛泽东思想送给山区人民是我的责任。前些时候，晋中新华书店在寿阳开现场会，叫我介绍经验。我对大家说：“咱实在没有什么经验，就有一个想法：毛主席的书是革命真经，劳动人民谁学了谁革命，用在那儿那儿灵。我自己要下决心学好，也有责任帮助山区人民学好。”
        干一辈子革命，学一辈子先进
    在党的教育和群众的支持下，我做了自己份内的一点工作，可领导和群众却给了我很高的荣誉。我牢牢记着，经常警告自己：什么成绩、功劳、荣誉，就连我萧富年，也是党和毛主席从苦海里打捞起来的；没有党，没有革命，就没有现在的一切。所以我丝毫没有理由自满，更不能倚老卖老，躺在荣誉上睡大觉，而必须坚决按照毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的指示办事，活到老、干到老、学到老。干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，学一辈子先进。
    正因为这样，我就天天看毛主席著作。白天串乡累一天，晚上回来结算后，总要点上油灯看一会。不看就觉得丢了一件什么似的。而且我不论走到那里，去干什么，总是抓住一切机会向先进学习。我发现所有的先进虽然各有特长，但追根究底都是毛泽东思想学的好、用的好。虚心学先进，也就是学他们活学活用毛泽东思想。有了这种认识，学先进就更加虚心诚心了。
    前年九月份，我利用参加全省财贸部门“五好”企业、“六好”职工代表会议的机会，访问了吕贵荣、张桂枝、范玲秀等同志。听了他们的介绍，我感受到，在活学活用毛主席著作这个最重要的问题上，也是年轻人超过老年人，一代人超过一代人啊！如果再不急起直追，向他们学习，就会落后啦。特别是听了浮山县寨圪?供销社的经验，我深深感到，这个社是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的活榜样，他们对毛主席亲手制订的“发展经济，保障供给”总方针学习的最好，执行的最好，所以我在会议休息时间，就数次登门取经。去年三月份又亲自去寨圪?参观学习。经过照镜子、找差距，发现了自己工作上的许多弱点，比如在组织发展多种经营上，人家是扶植集体多，咱是抓个人多；人家抓成套多，咱是抓零碎的多；人家是既抓眼前、又抓长远、长短结合，咱是注意当前、忽视长远、短多长少。
    从寨圪?回来，我向全社职工进行了传达，并在领导的直接指导和帮助下，作了具体规划，决定以大种、大养为突破口，全面学、赶、超寨圪?。我们的树儿岭大队，可是名不符实，连一棵树也没有。去年帮助栽了核桃、红枣、梨、苹果共四千九百多株，人们高兴地说：“照这样连着干上几年，可就变成真正的树儿岭啦。”羊头寨大队是我购销店的驻地（我是一九六五年春由尚家寨移来这里），去年帮助种了一条果树沟，一条梨树沟，一条三十亩的杏树沟，还有一个枣树坡，一个核桃树嘴。当地想种花椒没技术，我又从和顺请来许村供销社主任帮助育了一亩苗，短短一年时间，就种了各种果木树一万四千多株（不包括杏树、花椒），同时还种了党参、牛夕、生地。
    学了张桂枝大闹花果山的经验，感到自己虽然也住在山里，对山的利用很不够，去年我就提出了大挖双风山的建议。为了弄清山里的资源情况，我们社的指导员王蝉贵同志同我一起入山勘察，白天钻沟爬坡，晚上住在牛棚，一连跑了五六天，终于发现了许多新品种，然后就发动社员上山大采，收购品种比前年增加了三十二种，一秋天就从山里挖出八千多块钱来，加上其他副业收入，我所服务的六个大队，每户平均收入达到一百二十元，比前年增加了四十元。
    不只要向全省著名的先进单位和先进个人学习，而且谁有先进经验就向谁学。昔阳县大寨供销社蒙山分销店的业务员李国信、盂县牛村供销社的马变花，过去都曾向我学习，他们很谦虚说是我的徒弟，其实从来都是互帮互学、取长补短。这二年年轻人进步很快，我就去蒙山通过跟班劳动，向李国信同志学习为贫下中农服务，组织编织生产等先进经验，从去年，我又专心学习马变花工地供应的经验，效果都很好。
    我的体会是：只要真正是为革命而学，为革命而超，首先学政治、学思想、学风格，活学活用毛泽东思想，那就会感到处处有先进，学了就能用。
    我在毛泽东思想指导下，做了的一些工作，跟党和群众的要求距离很远。我要更加努力读毛主席的书，坚决听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，把一切献给党，献给革命，献给山区人民。
