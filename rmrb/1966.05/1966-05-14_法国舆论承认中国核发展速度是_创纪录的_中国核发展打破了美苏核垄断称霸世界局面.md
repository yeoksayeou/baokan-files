    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th – The successful Chinese nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials has attracted great attention from the French public and opinion circles. French figures pointed out that China's achievement has ended the US-Soviet two-power monopoly of nuclear weapons and hegemony over the world.
    Although some bourgeois newspapers expressed "unease" and even slandered and attacked China, they had to admit that China had made "amazing progress" in military, industrial, and scientific fields. Some newspapers said that the speed of this progress was "record-breaking."
    A Paris report in the *New York Herald Tribune* stated that French figures believed that China's achievement "ended the US-Soviet monopoly (of nuclear weapons)" and "ended the situation in which the US and Soviet two major power blocs divided the world." They were also surprised by the rapid progress China had made since its first atomic bomb explosion.
    A veteran French journalist said that China's achievement is conducive to world peace. He said that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons.
    French newspapers all carried related news or commentaries. *Le Figaro* reported on China's nuclear explosion on the 10th with the headline: "Communist China's 'Leap Forward' in the Nuclear Field." The newspaper said that this new explosion put China "into the ranks of thermonuclear powers." This test, which was "only eighteen months" after China's first atomic bomb explosion, "confirmed the amazing progress China has made as a nuclear power, not only in military terms, but also in industrial and scientific terms." *Aujourd'hui Paris* said that China has "created a record for the speed of progress" in this area. Agence France-Presse said that China's new achievement "established its position as a world nuclear power in military, industrial, and scientific terms."
    On the evening of the 9th, French television made an exception by broadcasting the news of China's successful nuclear explosion containing thermonuclear materials at the beginning of the broadcast without reporting news programs. The television station said that this achievement is "technologically very surprising."

    法国舆论承认中国核发展速度是“创纪录的”
    中国核发展打破了美苏核垄断称霸世界局面
    新华社巴黎十二日电　中国进行含有热核材料的核爆炸成功的消息在法国公众和舆论界中引起了很大的注意。法国人士指出，中国的成就结束了美苏两霸垄断核武器、称霸世界的局面。
    尽管有一些资产阶级报刊表示“不安”、甚至对中国诽谤中伤，它们不得不承认中国在军事、工业和科学上取得了“惊人进步”。有的报纸说，这种进展速度是“创纪录的”。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》的一则巴黎报道说，法国人士认为，中国这一成就“结束了美苏（对核武器的）垄断”，“结束了美苏两个大国集团瓜分世界的局面”。他们还对中国在第一次原子弹爆炸后取得了如此迅速的进展表示吃惊。
    法国一位老资格新闻界人士说，中国这个成就有助于世界和平。他说，中国将永远不首先使用核武器。
    法国报刊都刊载了有关消息或评论。《费加罗报》十日报道中国核爆炸所用的通栏标题是：《共产党中国在核方面的“跃进”》。这家报纸说，这次新爆炸使中国“进入了热核大国的行列”。这次试验距中国第一次原子弹爆炸“只有十八个月”，它“证实了，中国作为一个核大国，不仅在军事上、而且在工业和科学上所取得的惊人进步”。《今日巴黎报》说，中国在这方面“创造了进展速度的纪录”。法新社说，中国取得的新成就，“在军事、工业和科学方面都确立了它作为世界核国家的地位”。
    法国电视台九日晚上破例地在广播一开始时不报告新闻节目，而广播中国进行了含有热核材料的核爆炸成功的消息。电视台说，这个成就“在技术方面是十分令人惊异的”。
