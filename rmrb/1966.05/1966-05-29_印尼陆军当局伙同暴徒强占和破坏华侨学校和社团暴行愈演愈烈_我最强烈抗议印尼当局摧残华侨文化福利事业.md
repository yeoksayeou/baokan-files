    The Indonesian Army Authorities Collude with Mobs to Seize and Destroy Overseas Chinese Schools and Organizations, Atrocities Intensifying
    We Most Strongly Protest the Indonesian Authorities' Destruction of Overseas Chinese Cultural and Welfare Undertakings
    Our Embassy's Note Solemnly Points Out: All Atrocities Against Overseas Chinese Schools and Organizations are Staged According to the Instructions of the Indonesian Government, Which is Another Extremely Serious Step Deliberately Rupturing Bilateral Relations
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th: A message states that on May 22nd, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia handed a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lodging the strongest protest against the fascist atrocities of destroying, looting, and illegally seizing Overseas Chinese schools and organizations throughout Indonesia, which occurred under the planning and arrangement of the Indonesian government.

    The note states that after the Chinese Embassy submitted protest notes to the Indonesian government on April 9th and 10th regarding the closure of Overseas Chinese schools and the seizure of Overseas Chinese organizations in Jakarta, West Java, South Sumatra, Bandung, Malang, and other places, not only has it received no response to date, but under the instruction of the Indonesian authorities, the atrocities of seizing and destroying Overseas Chinese schools and organizations have intensified, spreading throughout Indonesia.

    The note listed the barbaric crimes of the Indonesian armed forces, in collusion with mobs from right-wing organizations such as "KAPI" ("Indonesian Youth and Students United Action Front"), continuing to illegally occupy, take over, close down, and destroy Overseas Chinese schools and Overseas Chinese organizations in various parts of Indonesia since March. In Jakarta, 27 Overseas Chinese organizations, including the General Association of Overseas Chinese, were illegally occupied. In Bandung, three Overseas Chinese organizations, including the Chinese General Association, were forcibly seized. In Medan, North Sumatra, nine organizations, including the General Association of Overseas Chinese, and thirteen schools, including Overseas Chinese Middle School, were successively destroyed and seized. Overseas Chinese schools and organizations in ten cities, including Siantar in North Sumatra, were all taken over by local military authorities in collaboration with reactionary organizations. The Overseas Chinese General Association and two schools in Padang, West Sumatra, were destroyed by mobs. The military authorities in West Sumatra also announced that Overseas Chinese schools in the jurisdiction would be placed under "supervision." In Aceh, three Overseas Chinese organizations and schools, including the General Association of Overseas Chinese, were forcibly taken over. In Langsa, five Overseas Chinese organizations and schools, including the General Association of Overseas Chinese, were closed down. Military and political authorities in places such as Pekanbaru, Tanjung Pinang, and Belitung successively took over Overseas Chinese organizations and schools.

    In Central Java, including the Yogyakarta Special Region, all Overseas Chinese schools were taken over and converted into "National Schools." Overseas Chinese organizations and schools were destroyed and taken over in Yogyakarta, Solo, Semarang, Purwokerto, Kudus, Magelang, Pekalongan, Tegal, Salatiga, and Shuangjiao Han in Central Java.

    In East Java, all Overseas Chinese schools in the jurisdiction were "temporarily closed"; in Surabaya, eighteen Overseas Chinese primary and secondary schools were placed under "supervision," and ten schools were forcibly taken over; four organizations, including the United Federation of Overseas Chinese Organizations, were destroyed, looted, and seized. In West Nusa Tenggara, all Overseas Chinese schools in the jurisdiction were closed down. Overseas Chinese organizations and schools were forcibly taken over in Bali, Lombok, and Bima.

    In South and Southeast Sulawesi, all Overseas Chinese schools in the jurisdiction were taken over and converted into "National Schools," and all Overseas Chinese organizations were closed down.

    In Manado, North Sulawesi; Maluku; Ambon and Kendari; West Kalimantan; and South Kalimantan, all Overseas Chinese schools were "supervised" or "controlled." In Pontianak, Singkawang, Bangka, Sambas, and other places in West Kalimantan, Overseas Chinese schools were closed down, and Overseas Chinese organizations were destroyed and seized.

    In Samarinda, Tarakan, and other places in East Kalimantan, Overseas Chinese organizations and schools were taken over.

    The note emphasized that all atrocities of forcibly occupying and taking over Overseas Chinese schools and organizations in various places were carried out by local army authorities in collusion with right-wing reactionary mobs. In most cases, Overseas Chinese schools and organizations were first destroyed, looted, and forcibly occupied by mobs, then transferred to local military authorities, followed by orders to close down or take over, and allocated to right-wing organizations for use. In some cases, the military authorities first ordered "supervision" and closure, and then allowed right-wing mobs to occupy or loot them. All atrocities against Overseas Chinese schools and organizations were staged according to the instructions of the Indonesian government authorities. They arbitrarily insulted the national flag of the People's Republic of China and portraits of the Chinese people's beloved leaders, burned Chinese books and documents, and seized a large amount of equipment, vehicles, and other property for their own use. Some even rudely insulted and beat Overseas Chinese teachers and students and Overseas Chinese organization staff.

    The note stated that the so-called "KAMI" and "KAPI" and other right-wing reactionary mobs are merely a special operations force controlled by the right-wing general group. It is not difficult to understand why some responsible officials in Indonesia recently praised the outright banditry committed by these mobs as "revolutionary" and "heroic" deeds.

    The note stated that in order to cater to the needs of imperialism, the Indonesian government has completely disregarded international law and the norms of international relations, crudely destroying the cultural and welfare undertakings of Overseas Chinese who have made important contributions to maintaining and developing the friendship between the two peoples, causing more than 200,000 Overseas Chinese children to lose their schooling, nearly 10,000 teachers and staff to lose their jobs, and plunging the vast number of Overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia into chaos and insecurity. This is another extremely serious step by the Indonesian government deliberately rupturing bilateral relations. The Chinese Embassy expresses great indignation at this and lodges the strongest protest to the Indonesian government.

    The note solemnly demanded that the Indonesian government immediately revoke the unreasonable decisions of the relevant regional military authorities to close down and take over Overseas Chinese schools and organizations, return the illegally seized school buildings and Overseas Chinese organization meeting places, as well as the occupied and looted Overseas Chinese public and private property, compensate for all losses, enable Overseas Chinese schools to resume operation as soon as possible, enable Overseas Chinese organizations to resume their normal work, and take necessary measures to effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese schools and organizations, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

### 印尼陆军当局伙同暴徒强占和破坏华侨学校和社团暴行愈演愈烈  我最强烈抗议印尼当局摧残华侨文化福利事业

    印尼陆军当局伙同暴徒强占和破坏华侨学校和社团暴行愈演愈烈
    我最强烈抗议印尼当局摧残华侨文化福利事业
    我大使馆照会严正指出：所有侵犯华侨学校、社团的暴行，都是按照印度尼西亚政府指令演出的，这是蓄意破裂两国关系的又一极端严重的步骤
    新华社二十八日讯  雅加达消息：中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十二日把一件照会交给印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚全国各地在印度尼西亚政府策划和布置下，发生了破坏、抢劫和非法侵占华侨学校和社团的法西斯暴行，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，中国大使馆在四月九日、十日向印度尼西亚政府递交了关于雅加达、西爪哇和南苏门答腊、万隆、玛琅等地方封闭华侨学校、侵占华侨团体的抗议照会以后，迄今不仅没有得到任何答复，而且在印度尼西亚当局的指使下，强占和破坏华侨学校和社团的暴行愈演愈烈，竟遍及印度尼西亚全国。
    照会列举了三月份以来印度尼西亚武装部队伙同“卡比”（“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”）等右派组织的暴徒，在印度尼西亚各地继续非法霸占、接管、封闭和破坏华侨学校和华侨团体的野蛮罪行。在雅加达非法霸占了中华侨团总会等二十七所华侨团体。在万隆继续强占了中华总会等三所华侨团体。在北苏门答腊棉兰先后破坏和强占了华侨总会等九个社团和华侨中学等十三所学校。北苏门答腊的先达等十个城市的华侨学校和社团全部被各地军事当局协同反动组织所接管。西苏门答腊巴东的华侨总会和两所学校被暴徒破坏。西苏门答腊军事当局还宣布将辖区的华侨学校置于“监督”之下。在亚齐，强行接管了华侨总会等三所社团和学校。在冷沙，封闭了华侨总会等五所社团和学校。北干峇鲁、丹绒槟榔、勿里洞等地的军政当局先后接管了华侨团体和学校。
    在中爪哇，包括日惹特区，接管了所有华侨学校并改为“国民学校”。在中爪哇的日惹、梭罗、三宝垄、普禾格多、古突士、马吉冷、北加朗岸、直葛、沙拉迪加和双胶汉等地纷纷破坏和接管了华侨团体和学校。
    在东爪哇，“暂时封闭”了辖区内的全部华侨学校；在泗水市，有十八所华侨中小学被置于“监督”之下，并强行接管了十所学校；破坏、抢劫和强占了中华侨团联合会等四个社团。在西努沙登加拉，关闭了辖区内的所有华侨学校。在峇厘、龙目和美玛等地强行接管了华侨团体和学校。
    在南与东南苏拉威西接管了辖区内的所有华侨学校，改为“国民学校”，并封闭了全部华侨社团。
    在北苏拉威西万鸦佬、马鹿姑、安汶和干纳底、西加里曼丹、南加里曼丹等地“监督”或“管制”了所有的华侨学校。在西加里曼丹的坤甸、山口洋、邦戛、三发等地封闭了华侨学校，破坏和强占了华侨团体。
    在东加里曼丹三马林达、打拉根等地接管了华侨社团和学校。
    照会强调指出，所有各地强占和接管华侨学校和社团的暴行，都是各地陆军当局伙同右派反动暴徒干出来的。华侨学校和社团在多数情况下是由暴徒先进行破坏、抢劫和强占，然后转交给地方军事当局，接着再下令封闭或接管，转拨右派组织使用，也有的是先由军事当局下令“监督”和封闭，然后让右派暴徒占用或进行劫掠。所有侵犯华侨学校和社团的暴行，都是按照印度尼西亚政府当局的指令演出的。他们恣意侮辱中华人民共和国国旗和中国人民敬爱的领导人的画象，烧毁中文书籍和文卷，抢走大量设备、车辆和其他财物据为己有。有的还横蛮辱骂、殴打华侨师生和侨团职员。
    照会说，所谓“卡米”、“卡比”等右派反动暴徒，不过是右派将领集团所掌握和控制的一支别动队而已。人们也就不难理解，为什么最近印度尼西亚的一些负责官员，将这些暴徒所干出的十足的匪盗行为，称颂为“革命”、“英雄”事迹的真实原因了。
    照会说，印度尼西亚政府为了迎合帝国主义的需要，竟然完全不顾国际公法和国际关系的准则，粗暴地摧残对维护与发展两国人民友谊有过重要贡献的华侨的文化福利事业，致使华侨子女二十多万人失学，近万名教职员失业，使居住在印度尼西亚的广大华侨陷入混乱和不安，这是印度尼西亚政府蓄意破裂两国关系的又一极端严重的步骤。中国大使馆对此表示极大的愤慨，特向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会严正要求印度尼西亚政府，立即撤销有关地区军事当局封闭和接管华侨学校、团体的无理决定，交还被非法强占的学校校舍、侨团会所，以及被占用、被劫走的华侨公私财物，赔偿一切损失，使华侨学校尽速复办，使华侨团体恢复其正常工作，并采取必要措施，切实保障华侨学校和社团的正当权益，保证不再发生类似事件。
