    Pakistani Public Opinion Condemns Soviet Union's Continued Supply of Arms to India
    Soviet Arming of India Equals Inciting War
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 22nd, Malik Khuda Bakhsh, Chairman of the West Pakistan Muslim League, told reporters in Lahore on May 20th that Indian leaders, encouraged by the influx of weapons from the Soviet Union and other sources, have launched a campaign of hatred and slander against Pakistan, creating new tensions in Indo-Pakistani relations.

    He said that Indian leaders are creating war hysteria in their country, plagued by famine and unrest. Their increasingly aggressive tone in speeches and their threatening posture along the Pakistani border are a direct result of India's renewed and frantic arms expansion.
    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 21st. Karachi's *Dawn* published an editorial on May 21st regarding the Soviet Union's recent provision of large quantities of weapons to Indian reactionaries, titled "Adding Fuel to the Fire," which stated: Given India's current provocative and bellicose attitude, "the Soviet Union's continued provision of military aid to India is tantamount to inciting war."

    The editorial pointed out that if India did not receive foreign military aid, "it is inconceivable that it would dare to display a chauvinistic attitude towards its neighbors on the verge of collapse—its economic structure, its ridiculous democracy, and its corrupt leadership."
    The editorial said, "We must oppose the Soviet Union's continued military assistance to India."
    Another Karachi newspaper, *Freedom*, also published an editorial on May 21st opposing the Soviet Union's provision of large quantities of weapons to India.

    The editorial stated that Pakistan has strongly protested and warned that these war materials would be used against Pakistan, while Western countries frantically and continuously provide India with war materials. Everyone knows the sinister motives of Western countries.

    The editorial questioned, "What is the real motive of the Soviet Union in doing this?"

    巴基斯坦公众舆论谴责苏联继续供应印度军火
    苏联武装印度等于煽动战火
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第二十二日电　西巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟主席马利克·胡达·巴赫什五月二十日在拉合尔对报界发表谈话说，印度领导人由于又从苏联和其他方面运入武器而受到鼓励，发动了仇恨和诋毁巴基斯坦的运动，在印度和巴基斯坦的关系中制造新的紧张局势。
    他说，印度领导人正在他们的饥荒遍地和动乱不宁的国家中制造战争歇斯底里。他们在讲话中越来越多侵略性的语调，在沿着巴基斯坦边界又摆出一副威吓的架式。这是印度重新疯狂扩军的直接结果。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十一日电　卡拉奇报纸《晨报》二十一日就苏联最近向印度反动派提供大量武器发表题为《煽风点火》的社论说：在印度目前采取挑衅好战的态度的情况下，“苏联源源不断地向印度提供军事援助，等于是煽动战火。”
    社论指出，如果印度得不到外国的军事援助，“它会敢在它的行将倒坍的废墟上——它的经济结构、它的可笑的民主和腐败的领导——对它的邻国耍沙文主义态度是不能设想的。”
    社论说：“我们必须反对苏联继续给予印度军事援助。”
    卡拉奇的另一家报纸《自由报》二十一日也发表社论，反对苏联向印度提供大量武器。
    社论说，在西方国家疯狂地源源不断地给予印度战争物资的时候，巴基斯坦曾经强烈抗议，并且警告说，这些战争物资是用来对付巴基斯坦的。大家都知道西方国家的这种不可告人的目的。
    社论质问道，“苏联这样做的真正动机是什么？”
