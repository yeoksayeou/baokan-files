    Chairman Mao’s scientific thesis on “the East wind prevailing over the West wind” is the source of strength for the revolutionary people of the world to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people and deflating the arrogance of the enemy. Deng Tuo's cursing of our love for the "East wind" is precisely to make us love the "West wind." This is wishful thinking! Deng Tuo, the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never be fooled by you! We must peel off the painted skin of this poisonous snake, Deng Tuo, and knock out its poisonous fangs.
              Gansu Second Construction Engineering Company Worker Zeng Guobao
    Deng Tuo slanders us for "making enemies everywhere." Yes, we have "made" some enemies, but not everywhere. Enemies like American imperialism and modern revisionism, and enemies like Deng Tuo who oppose the Party and oppose socialism, must be "made." If we do not recognize enemies as enemies, we will inevitably recognize enemies as friends, like modern revisionists, and in this way the world communist movement will be in danger of being buried.
                      Nanning Pharmaceutical Factory Worker Mei Weimin
    Deng Tuo attacks our proletarian dictatorship as "hegemony." We say that we should be "hegemonic" in dealing with enemies. If there is no "hegemony" of the proletariat, there will be the "hegemony" of the bourgeoisie. Deng Tuo wants us not to be "hegemonic" in front of them, "not to say anything," and "not to do anything." His only purpose is to let them practice "hegemony" in front of the working people, letting them have the final say in everything and letting them do everything. Wouldn't this become the world of demons and monsters?

    Wei Yan in *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* had a "rebellious bone" behind his head and was a typical political opportunist. Deng Tuo, Wu Han and his ilk can also be said to be Wei Yans in the revolutionary ranks. They once arrogantly declared through the mouth of Hai Rui: "In old age, the arrogant bone is still there, how can I bend my waist to flatter powerful ministers." Now, the revolutionary people are going to pull out that "rebellious bone" behind your heads.

    Deng Tuo and Wu Han said that there were "honest officials" and "good officials" in the old society, and also said that "good officials" were also appointed by the people. This is a slander against the people. All officials in the old society exploited and oppressed the people, how could they be appointed by the people? I remember when I fled from famine from Henan to Shanxi, the high officials and petty officials I saw were all landlords and rich peasants. At that time, we poor people once elected a partner to be the Lilzhang, and the landlord scolded: "I would rather let a dog be it than let a poor person be it." They also colluded with the government to arrest seven or eight poor people and put them in jail in the name of "disturbing the election." That's how it was in the old society: how could there be good people as officials!
              Shanxi Province, Jiangxian County, Nanliu Brigade Commune Member Liang Zhenhai
    Some of Deng Tuo's articles "talk about books and paintings," "transmit knowledge," "tell jokes," and study "raising cats and dogs," etc. It seems that they are all promoting leisure and elegance, and it seems that there is no politics. In fact, this is the most vicious political attack by the bourgeoisie on the proletariat. "Don't say that scholars are empty talk," "care about everything in the world," this is Deng Tuo's self-confession. It turns out that Deng Tuo's promotion of "leisure and elegance" is precisely one aspect of his counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy - promoting the bourgeois way of life and promoting "peaceful evolution."

    锄草集
    毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的科学论断，是全世界革命人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的力量源泉，大大长了革命人民的志气，灭了敌人的威风。邓拓咒骂我们热爱“东风”，就是想让我们热爱“西风”，这真是痴心妄想！邓拓，毛泽东思想武装起来的人民是决不会上你们的当的！我们一定要剥掉邓拓这条毒蛇的画皮，敲掉它的毒牙。
              甘肃第二建筑工程公司工人　曾国宝
    邓拓诬蔑我们“到处树敌”。是的，我们是“树”了
  一些敌，但不是到处树敌。对于美帝国主义和现代修正主义这样的敌，对于邓拓之流反党反社会主义这样的敌，是非树不可的。如果不认敌为敌，就必然要象现代修正主义者那样认敌为友，这样世界共产主义运动就有被葬送的危险。
                      南宁制药厂工人　梅伟民
    邓拓攻击我们无产阶级专政是“霸道”，我们说对付敌人就应该“霸道”，如果没有无产阶级的“霸道”，就会出资产阶级的“霸道”。邓拓要我们在他们面前不要“霸道”，“什么话都不要说”，“什么事情都不能做”，唯一的目的，就是好让他们在劳动人民面前大行“霸道”，什么话都让他们说了算，什么事都让他们做了算。这不就成了牛鬼蛇神的天下了么？
                    武汉某工厂干部　徐绍礼
    《三国演义》里的魏延脑后有根“反骨”，是个典型的政治投机分子。邓拓、吴晗之流也可以说是革命队伍里的魏延。他们曾经借海瑞之口狂妄地宣称：“老来傲骨犹然在，岂肯折腰媚权臣。”现在，革命人民就是要拔掉你们脑后那根“反骨”。
                    新疆军区政治部　程启瑞
    邓拓、吴晗说旧社会有“清官”“好官”，还说“好官”也是人民封的。这是对人民的污蔑。旧社会所有的官都是剥削压迫人民的，怎么会是人民封的呢？记得我从河南逃荒来到山西的时候，见到的大官、小官都是地主、富农。当时我们穷人曾经推举了个伙伴当闾长，地主就大骂：“宁肯叫狗当，也不让穷人当。”还沟通官府以“捣乱选举”为名，抓了七八个穷人送进了班房。旧社会就是这样：当官的那有好人！
              山西省绛县南柳大队社员　梁振海
    邓拓有些文章“谈书说画”，“传知识”，“说笑话”，研究“养猫养狗”之类，看来都是宣扬闲情逸致，好象没有什么政治。其实不然，这正是资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的最恶毒的政治。“莫谓书生空议论”，“事事关心天地间”，这就是邓拓的不打自招。原来邓拓的宣扬“闲情逸致”，正是他反革命两手政策的一个方面——宣传资产阶级生活方式，推行“和平演变”。
