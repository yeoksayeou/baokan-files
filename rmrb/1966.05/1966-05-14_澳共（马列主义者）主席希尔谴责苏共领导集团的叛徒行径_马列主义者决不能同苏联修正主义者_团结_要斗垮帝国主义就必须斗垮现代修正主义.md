    Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)'s official newspaper, *The Vanguard*, published an article by Party Chairman Hill on the 5th, entitled: "Why There Can Be No Unity Between Marxist-Leninists and Modern Revisionists." The article pointed out that the Soviet Communist leadership are labor traitors, betrayers, and allies of U.S. imperialism. Marxist-Leninists, responsible for the fate of the world, must never engage in "reconciliation" or "unity" with them.

    The article begins by clearly stating: "It is quite clear that there can be no reconciliation with those we call modern revisionists." The article says: "This question is both a theoretical question and a concrete practical question." "Khrushchev has been removed. It is said that the situation has changed; the new leaders are better; since Khrushchev has stepped down, the revisionists are better in capitalist countries; there is a possibility of unity and reconciliation. But we must assert that the situation has not improved: it has deteriorated."

    The article points out: "The fact is that Khrushchev and his partners (who are now his successors) represent the bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union. In fact, there is a bourgeois stratum in the Soviet Union. The high-paid stratum lives by exploiting workers.

      "That is their economic base, just like in capitalist society. ... Everything the Soviet revisionists do stems from their class interests—the bourgeoisie (interests). Therefore, they practice class unity with capitalists all over the world. ... They seek a common position with capitalists in what they see as another powerful capitalist country—the United States."

    The article lists the treacherous acts of Khrushchev and his successors in the Soviet Communist leadership group. It says: "Khrushchev aided the Indian reactionaries in fighting China, and Kosygin supported India in fighting Pakistan, and then imposed the so-called Tashkent Agreement to strengthen India. Kosygin suggested that socialist countries take joint action to support Vietnam. On the surface, this seems very moving. Some people say that we should give it a try so that the Soviet leaders can expose themselves. Therefore, we should implement unity and agree to this suggestion. We believe that this is very wrong. The Soviet leaders have already exposed themselves.

      "Khrushchev pursued a policy of disengagement in Vietnam, which was to completely withdraw from there and let the United States handle it. Kosygin pursued a policy of engagement in Vietnam in order to achieve the same goal, which is for the Soviet Union and the United States to control the situation. The Soviet leaders hope to end the struggle in Vietnam through negotiations, which is to allow U.S. imperialism to remain in Vietnam. ...

      "If they occupy important military strongholds in Vietnam or provide important military supplies to Vietnam, then they can use this to control the situation, just as they used the missiles in Cuba."

      "Would you engage in a decisive struggle with someone you already know is a traitor in order to test his act of betrayal? Of course not."

      "We know from numerous facts about the Soviet leaders' betrayal and their actual alliance with the U.S. imperialists. There is the 'Camp David spirit,' the 'Tashkent spirit,' open collusion with the Indian reactionaries, attempts to reach agreements with Japanese imperialists, and coordinated actions with U.S. imperialism." "It is only because of the Soviet leaders' actual (not imagined) actions that U.S. imperialism has been able to withdraw from Europe the troops that are of decisive significance to them in Vietnam."

    "The Soviet leaders interfere in the internal affairs of the Japanese Communist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party, the New Zealand Communist Party, and all other Communist Parties, including those in Asia and Europe, attempting to impose their line of peaceful transition, peaceful coexistence, and negotiations upon them. This line is to exchange peace at all costs; to reach an agreement with U.S. imperialism at all costs."

    When discussing the so-called "reconciliation" with the Soviet revisionist group, the article emphasizes: "For the Chinese and for us, even raising this question is an act of betrayal. Doing so would imply that these people have some merit. This will only fuel their betrayal and be a betrayal of the world's working people. The Soviet revisionists or our revisionists have nothing good, only bad."

    The article emphatically points out that it was correct and necessary for some Marxist-Leninist parties to refuse to attend the 23rd Congress of the CPSU. The article refutes the argument that this caused confusion. The article says, "We must say it again, attending a meeting initiated by traitors is to cover up for the traitors and help their betrayal. We know perfectly well from a wealth of facts that they are traitors."

    The article says, "Marxist-Leninists are responsible for the fate of the world. Anything they do that harms this fate is bad. In particular, the Chinese Party is considered, and correctly considered, to be the central party, the main Marxist-Leninist party. Would it be helpful to the Marxist-Leninists in the Soviet Union if the Chinese Party attended, for example? Quite the contrary. Would it be helpful to the Marxist-Leninists in Australia? Quite the contrary. The same goes for the whole world."

      "When a person is actually undermining a major struggle of workers in secret and convenes a meeting, ... can the workers in the struggle accept an invitation to attend the meeting to discuss how to carry out sabotage? Of course, they do not accept it, because going to the meeting—as if this person is not a labor traitor, this is helping him, giving him status, relieving him of his difficulties."

    "Those who did not attend the 23rd Congress are helping the struggle against labor traitors and betrayers. They make the labor traitors and betrayers more clearly exposed to the world."

    The article reveals that the Soviet Communist leadership invited the Communist Party of China and other Marxist-Leninist parties to attend the 23rd Congress of the CPSU "only to cover up their own revisionist betrayal and try to continue their betrayal."

    The article points out, "The revisionists have put the issue of revolution aside. They have abandoned the revolution. If they abandon the revolution, they must support capitalism, because only revolution can end capitalism. The struggle of the workers is to overthrow capitalism and the influence of capitalism in the working class. So, how can we reconcile or unite with them? To reconcile or unite with them means to reconcile or unite with capitalism. For us, giving them any comfort or assistance is to abandon Marxism-Leninism. This in itself is betrayal."

    The article says: "Someone once strongly argued to Lenin the necessity of unity. He agreed that unity was necessary, but unity on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. It was precisely because Lenin insisted on principles and rejected this 'unity' and 'reconciliation' that he created the world socialist system. In such an important historical period as today, demanding unity and reconciliation (with the revisionists) will only disarm the working class, just as such a demand would have disarmed the working class in Lenin's time."

    Therefore, we say: "There must be no unity and reconciliation with the revisionists. The world's working people are abandoning the revisionists. This can be seen internationally. This can be seen in Australia. We will never do anything to help the revisionists maintain their position. On the contrary, the distance between each other is getting bigger and bigger, and we must fight to the end and defeat revisionism. This is a very important part of the struggle to defeat capitalism and imperialism."

### 澳共（马列主义者）主席希尔谴责苏共领导集团的叛徒行径  马列主义者决不能同苏联修正主义者“团结”  要斗垮帝国主义就必须斗垮现代修正主义

    澳共（马列主义者）主席希尔谴责苏共领导集团的叛徒行径
    马列主义者决不能同苏联修正主义者“团结”
    要斗垮帝国主义就必须斗垮现代修正主义
    新华社十三日讯　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》五日发表党主席希尔的文章：《为什么在马克思列宁主义者和现代修正主义者之间不能存在任何团结》。文章指出，苏共领导是工贼，是叛徒，是美帝国主义的同盟者，马克思列宁主义者要对全世界的命运负责，决不能同他们搞“和解”、“团结”。
    文章一开始就明确指出：“十分清楚，同被我们称为现代修正主义者的人是决不能和解的。”文章说：“这个问题是一个理论问题，也是一个具体的实践问题。”“赫鲁晓夫已经被撤换掉。据说，情况有了改变；新的领导人要好一些；由于赫鲁晓夫已经下台，在资本主义国家内，修正主义者就好一些了；存在着团结、和解的可能性。但我们必须断言，情况并没有改善：它恶化了。”
    文章指出：“事实是：赫鲁晓夫及其伙伴（他们现在是他的继承人）代表着苏联的资产阶级分子。事实上，在苏联存在着资产阶级阶层。高薪阶层是靠剥削工人生活的。
      “那是他们的经济基础，就象资本主义社会里一样。……苏联修正主义者所干的一切都出于他们的阶级利益——资产阶级（的利益）。所以，他们同全世界的资本家实行阶级团结。……他们同在他们看来是另一个强大的资本主义国家——美国——的资本家谋求共同的立场。”
    文章历数了赫鲁晓夫及其继承者苏共领导集团的叛徒行径。它说：“赫鲁晓夫援助印度反动派对中国作战，柯西金支持印度对巴基斯坦作战，然后把所谓的塔什干协议强加于人，以便加强印度。柯西金建议社会主义国家联合行动支持越南。表面上看来，这是很动人的。有些人说，应该试一试，这样能使苏联领导人自我暴露。因此应该实行团结和同意这个建议。我们认为，这是非常错误的。苏联领导人已经暴露了自己。
      “赫鲁晓夫在越南奉行脱离接触政策，那就是从那里完全脱身，让美国去搞。柯西金在越南奉行接触政策，以便达到同样的目的，那就是苏美控制局势。苏联领导人希望通过谈判结束越南的斗争，那就是让美帝国主义留在越南。……
      “如果他们占有越南重要的军事据点或者向越南提供重要的军事物资，那么他们就可以利用这一点来控制局势，正如他们在古巴利用火箭一样。”
      “你会同一个你已经确知是叛徒的人一道进行一场决定性的斗争，以便检验他的背叛行为吗？当然不。”
      “我们从许许多多的事实中知道苏联领导人的背叛行为以及他们同美帝国主义者实际的联盟。有‘戴维营精神’、有‘塔什干精神’，同印度反动派公开勾结，企图同日本帝国主义者达成协议，同美帝国主义互相配合采取一致行动。”“只是由于苏联领导人的实际的（而不是臆想的）行动，美帝国主义才能够从欧洲撤出对他们在越南来说是有决定意义的军队。”
    “苏联领导人干涉日本共产党、印度尼西亚共产党、新西兰共产党以及包括亚洲和欧洲共产党在内的其他一切共产党的内部事务，试图把他们的和平过渡、和平共处和谈判的路线强加于它们。这条路线是要不惜一切代价换取和平；不惜一切代价同美帝国主义达成协议。”
    文章在谈到所谓同苏联修正主义集团“和解”的问题时强调指出：“对中国人和我们来说，甚至提出这个问题都是一种背叛行为。这样做将暗示这些人还有可取之处。这只会助长他们的背叛行为，这将是对世界劳动人民的背叛。苏联修正主义者或者我国的修正主义者没有一点好的地方，只有坏的地方。”
    文章着重指出，一些马克思列宁主义政党拒绝参加苏共二十三大是正确的、必要的。文章驳斥所谓由于这些党不参加而造成了混乱的论调。文章说，“我们必须再说一遍，参加叛徒所发起的会议是给叛徒打掩护，是给他们的背叛帮忙。我们从大量事实中完全知道，他们是叛徒。”
    文章说，“马克思列宁主义者要对全世界的命运负责。他们所做的任何事情，只要是危害这一命运的，就是坏的。特别是，中国党被认为是，被正确地认为是中心的党，主要的马克思列宁主义政党。要是中国的党出席了，譬如说，对苏联的马克思列宁主义者会不会有帮助呢？恰恰相反。这对澳大利亚的马克思列宁主义者会不会有帮助呢？恰恰相反。对全世界也一样。”
      “当一个人实际上是在暗中破坏一场工人的大斗争并且召开一次会议的时候，……斗争中的工人难道可以接受邀请赴会讨论怎样进行破坏吗？他们当然不接受，因为跑去开会——就象这个人不是工贼似的，这就是给他帮忙，给他身份，给他解除困难。”
    “不参加第二十三次代表大会的人是帮助了反对工贼和叛徒的斗争。他们使工贼和叛徒更加清楚地暴露在全世界面前。”
    文章揭露说，苏共领导邀请中国共产党等马克思列宁主义政党参加苏共二十三大，“只不过是为了掩盖他们自己的修正主义背叛行为，并且设法继续搞背叛”。
    文章指出，“修正主义者已经把革命问题放在一边。他们放弃了革命。如果他们放弃革命，他们必然支持资本主义，因为只有革命才能结束资本主义。工人的斗争就是要打倒资本主义和资本主义在工人阶级中的影响。那么，怎么可以同他们和解或团结呢？同他们和解或团结就意味着同资本主义和解或团结。对于我们来说，给他们任何安慰或援助，就是背弃马克思列宁主义。这本身就是背叛。”
    文章说：“有人曾向列宁力陈团结的必要。他同意必须团结，但是要按照马克思列宁主义的原则来团结。正是由于列宁坚持原则和拒绝这种‘团结’与‘和解’，才开创了世界社会主义制度。在今天这样一个重要的历史时期，要求（同修正主义者）团结与和解，只会解除工人阶级的武装，就象这种要求在列宁时代会解除工人阶级武装一样的肯定。”
    因此我们说：“绝不能同修正主义者实行团结与和解。世界劳动人民正在弃绝修正主义者。这可以从国际上看出来。这可以在澳大利亚看出来。我们绝不做有助于修正主义者保住其地位的任何事情。相反，彼此之间的距离越来越大，我们要斗争到底，斗垮修正主义。这是斗垮资本主义和帝国主义的斗争的十分重要的一部分。”
