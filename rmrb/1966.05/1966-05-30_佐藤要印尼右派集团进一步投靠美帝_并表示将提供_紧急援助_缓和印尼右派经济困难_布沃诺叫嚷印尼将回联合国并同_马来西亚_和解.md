    佐藤要印尼右派集团进一步投靠美帝
    并表示将提供“紧急援助”缓和印尼右派经济困难  布沃诺叫嚷印尼将回联合国并同“马来西亚”和解
    新华社东京二十七日电  日本首相佐藤荣作二十六日接见正在日本乞求“援助”的印度尼西亚政府副总理哈孟库·布沃诺时，竭力称赞印度尼西亚法西斯军人集团夺取政权干得好。并且鼓励他们进一步投靠美帝国主义。
    据日本报纸报道，佐藤在会谈中毫不掩饰他对印度尼西亚右派军人集团把印度尼西亚拖向右转的满意心情。他说，他对印度尼西亚右派军人集团的
  “新政权的方向”，“一直表示强烈的关切”。他表示，“对于最近这个新政权的方向正在巩固这一点，感到高兴”。佐藤还说，他对印度尼西亚右派军人集团控制的“新政权的同志们长年来所做的努力正在收到成果这一点，衷心表示敬意”。佐藤还极力鼓动印度尼西亚右派军人集团重新回到美帝国主义控制的联合国。佐藤对布沃诺说，他“衷心希望”印度尼西亚右派军人集团“拿出勇气”，“早日回到联合国”。佐藤还表示“希望”印度尼西亚右派军人集团同样“拿出勇气”解决“马来西亚”争端。
    在会谈中佐藤表示，为了解决印度尼西亚当前的严重经济困难，要加强正在进行的“紧急援助”。他说，日本外务省等有关大臣正在积极地研究重建印度尼西亚的经济问题。“在紧急经济援助方面，我想尽快地做出结论。”
    布沃诺表示“感谢”佐藤的“好意”，并且说，可以指望印度尼西亚在“不久的将来”就会回到联合国以及有关组织，而且通过即将举行的印度尼西亚右派军人政权副总理兼外交部长阿达姆·马利克和“马来西亚”副总理拉扎克的会谈，对解决争端，一定会有“很大的进展”。
