    On the "Three-Family Village" Black Gang, Proletarian Dictatorship Must Be Implemented
    By Yi Caixue, Former Special-Class Merit Citation Recipient of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Second-Class Combat Hero, Minister of the People's Armed Forces Department of Zhongping District, Qianxi County, Guizhou Province
      After the anti-Party crimes of the "Three-Family Village" black gang were published in the newspaper, the more I read, the more indignant I became. Under the leadership of the Party, our broad masses of militiamen must, together with the people of the whole country, exercise dictatorship over this group of enemies without guns to the end, and defend the socialist state.
    Deng Tuo and his gang attack our country's proletarian dictatorship as "hegemonic," vainly attempting to abolish the proletarian dictatorship and allow landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and all monsters and demons to come to power, once again riding roughshod over the people and restoring capitalism. This is truly a toad trying to eat swan meat—a pipe dream. It is utterly impossible!
    In the old society, we working people suffered enough from the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class, being treated like beasts of burden, enduring endless hardships. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we overthrew the "three great mountains" weighing on our heads, established a new China, and implemented the proletarian dictatorship. From then on, the working people became masters of their own destiny and grasped the reins of power. The proletarian dictatorship's power was bought with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. The socialist state did not come easily, and our broad masses of militiamen must safeguard it. Deng Tuo and his gang want us to abolish the dictatorship over the enemy, which is actually to abolish class and class struggle. This is cast from the same mold as Khrushchev's modern revisionists' so-called "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people." We must expose Deng Tuo's conspiracy. The proletarian dictatorship protects the interests of the working people. If we do not exercise dictatorship over the enemy, the broad masses of working people will once again suffer oppression and exploitation. This is absolutely impossible. In order to protect the interests of the working people, we must further strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there will still be enemies without guns. They will inevitably wage a desperate struggle against us, and we must never underestimate these enemies." During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, these bad elements like Deng Tuo dared not compete with us with guns and cannons, but disguised themselves, wearing revolutionary cloaks, fabricating black language, viciously cursing our great Party, demanding that our Party step down and "rest," allowing revisionists to come to power. Although Deng Tuo and his gang played many tricks and exhausted all despicable and shameless means, they cannot conceal their reactionary essence. The Deng Tuo black gang vainly attempts to attack us with silent guns and cannons. This is like hitting a rock with an egg. In those years, on the Korean battlefield, we beat the American imperialists to a pulp, sending them into utter defeat. Today, this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, under the iron fists of the people of the whole country, will also be smashed to pieces.
    Chairman Mao said: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support; whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." Deng Tuo and his gang oppose the proletarian dictatorship, and we must do everything we can to strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. Our broad masses of militiamen are an important tool for our country to defend against imperialist aggression externally and to implement the people's democratic dictatorship internally. In past revolutionary war periods and socialist revolution and construction periods, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, our broad masses of militiamen have played a huge role in coordinating with the Chinese People's Liberation Army in defeating enemies at home and abroad and defending socialism. Today, people like Deng Tuo shamelessly attack our proletarian dictatorship, vainly attempting to reverse our revolutionary cause. Our broad masses of militiamen will never allow it. We must further arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, do a good job in militia work, actively participate in the socialist cultural revolution, open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, resolutely smash all the conspiracies of this gang of enemies without guns like Deng Tuo, carry the class struggle through to the end, and defend the socialist state.

### 对“三家村”黑帮必须实行无产阶级专政

    对“三家村”黑帮必须实行无产阶级专政
    前中国人民志愿军特等功臣、二级战斗英雄贵州省黔西县中坪区人民武装部部长  易才学
      “三家村”黑帮反党罪行在报上公布以后，我越看越愤慨。在党的领导下，我们广大民兵要和全国人民一起，对这帮不拿枪的敌人专政到底，保卫社会主义的江山。
    邓拓这伙人攻击我们国家的无产阶级专政“霸道”，妄想取消无产阶级专政，让地富反坏右和一切牛鬼蛇神上台，重新骑在人民头上作威作福，复辟资本主义。这真是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉——痴心妄想。一万个办不到！
    在旧社会，我们劳动人民受够了反动统治阶级的压迫和剥削，当牛当马，吃尽了千辛万苦。在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，推翻了压在我们头上的“三座大山”，建立了新中国，实行了无产阶级专政，从此，劳动人民当家做了主人，掌握了印把子。无产阶级专政的政权，是成千上万的革命烈士用鲜血换来的。社会主义的江山来得不容易，我们广大民兵一定要保住它。邓拓这伙人，要我们取消对敌人的专政，实际上就是要取消阶级和阶级斗争，这和赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者搞的什么“全民国家”、“全民党”，是一个模子铸出来的。我们一定要揭穿邓拓的这一阴谋。无产阶级专政保护劳动人民的利益，如果我们不对敌人实行专政，广大劳动人民就要重新遭受压榨和剥削，这是绝对办不到的。为了保护劳动人民的利益，我们要进一步加强和巩固无产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，邓拓这些坏家伙，不敢用明枪明炮来较量，而把自己伪装起来，披着革命的外衣，编造黑话，恶毒地咒骂我们伟大的党，要我们党下台“休息”，让修正主义分子上台。尽管邓拓一伙耍了不少的花招，用尽了卑鄙无耻的手段，也掩盖不了他们的反动本质。邓拓黑帮妄想用无声的枪炮来攻击我们，这是拿着鸡蛋碰石头。当年，我们在朝鲜战场上，打得美帝国主义落花流水，一败涂地。今天，邓拓这一小撮反党反社会主义分子，在全国人民的铁拳下，也一定要被打得粉身碎骨。
    毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”邓拓一伙反对无产阶级专政，我们就要全力加强和巩固无产阶级专政。我们广大民兵，是我国人民对外防御帝国主义侵略，对内实行人民民主专政的重要工具。在历次革命战争时期和社会主义革命和建设时期，我们广大民兵在党和毛主席的领导下，在配合中国人民解放军战胜国内外敌人、保卫社会主义的斗争中，起了巨大的作用。今天，邓拓之流无耻地攻击我们无产阶级专政，妄想要我们革命事业倒退，我们广大民兵绝不容许。我们一定要进一步用毛泽东思想武装头脑，一手拿锄，一手拿枪，搞好民兵工作，积极参加社会主义文化大革命，向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，坚决粉碎邓拓这伙不拿枪的敌人的一切阴谋诡计，把阶级斗争进行到底，保卫社会主义的江山。
