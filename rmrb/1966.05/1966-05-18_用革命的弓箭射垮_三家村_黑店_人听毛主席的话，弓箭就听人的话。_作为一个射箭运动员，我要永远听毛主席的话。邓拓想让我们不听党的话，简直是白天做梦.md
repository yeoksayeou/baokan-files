	Use Revolutionary Arrows to Shoot Down the "Three-Family Village" Black Inn
	“If people listen to Chairman Mao's words, the bow and arrow will listen to the people." As an archery athlete, I will always listen to Chairman Mao's words. Deng Tuo's attempt to make us not listen to the Party is simply a pipe dream.
	Athlete of the People's Liberation Army Archery Team Li Shulan
	Hearing about the crimes of Deng Tuo and a small handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist gang, I was simply furious. Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party, anti-socialist elements, under the guise of "red flag" opposing the red flag, using historical stories, knowledge, and jokes as a cover, released black arrows one after another behind our backs, attacking our Party, attacking our great leader, attacking our socialist system, viciously slandering the scientific conclusion that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" as "great empty talk," "clichés," slandering our Great Leap Forward as "bragging," and falsely saying that our socialist cause is "the assets of a single egg." What our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao say are all truths, and the guidelines and policies they put forward reflect the highest demands and highest interests of the people of the whole country. The achievements our Party has led us to create are very great. I have participated in archery competitions in seven provinces across the country and have seen countless large factories, and both cities and countryside are advancing rapidly. Take our country's sports undertakings, for example! Before liberation, foreigners said we were the "sick men of East Asia." Now, we not only have a complete sports system but also a strong sports team with strong ideological awareness, excellent skills, and a tough style, and the achievements are amazing. Although our country's archery has an ancient tradition, it was almost extinct under the discrimination and restrictions of the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek. The Party led us to develop this sport, and we can do whatever we say. In the short few years since the establishment of our team in 1959, the women's team has taken back seven of the twelve world records monopolized by imperialism and revisionism. Can this ironclad fact be said to have been blown out of "bragging"? We athletes of New China absolutely do not allow the likes of Deng Tuo to attack so rampantly! We must stand at the forefront in this life-and-death socialist cultural revolution, draw the revolutionary bow and arrow, and resolutely shoot down the "Three-Family Village" black inn they opened.
	The Deng Tuo gang is extremely arrogant and even clamors for our Party to step down and "rest." We tell you: Absolutely impossible! The Party and Chairman Mao will always be the red sun in our hearts. Without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, we would not have our lives. I was born into a lower-middle peasant family and used to live a life of not having enough to eat or wear. After liberation, under the Party's and Chairman Mao's kind care and guidance, I became a national athlete and have been to three countries to participate in competitions. If I were in the old society ruled by landlords and capitalists, I don't know what would have happened to me, would I be here today? My personal growth is the result of the Party's and Chairman Mao's care and guidance. I found direction, courage, and strength in Chairman Mao's works, and understood the principle of shooting arrows for the revolution and serving the people, linking everything I have with the people of the whole country, and striving for lofty honor for the Party and the people. In the practice of learning and applying Chairman Mao's instructions, I deeply realized the truth that "if people listen to Chairman Mao's words, the bow and arrow will listen to the people." Therefore, I have the courage to overcome difficulties and the strength to rush towards world records. In the past few years, we have broken seven world records eleven times, won honor for the Party and the country, and powerfully crushed the imperialist monopoly of international sports. All this was given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao. Deng Tuo and his gang want us not to listen to the Party; it's simply a pipe dream. We not only have to listen now, but we will always listen. We will pass on Chairman Mao's words as the supreme instruction for generations. We must firmly grasp Chairman Mao's weapon of class struggle, resolutely defend the people's country, and contribute all our strength to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

    用革命的弓箭射垮“三家村”黑店
    “人听毛主席的话，弓箭就听人的话。”作为一个射箭运动员，我要永远听毛主席的话。邓拓想让我们不听党的话，简直是白天做梦
    解放军射箭队运动员　李淑兰
    听到邓拓一小撮黑帮反党反社会主义的罪行，我简直气炸了肺。邓拓这伙反党反社会主义分子，打着“红旗”反红旗，以说历史、讲故事、传知识、说笑话作幌子，在我们的背后一支一支地放出黑箭，攻击我们的党，攻击我们的伟大领袖，攻击我们的社会主义制度，恶毒地污蔑“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是“伟大的空话”、“陈词滥调”，污蔑我们的大跃进是“吹牛皮”，瞎说我们的社会主义事业是“一个鸡蛋的家当”。我们党中央和毛主席所说的话都是真理，所提出的方针政策都反映了全国人民的最高要求和最高利益。党领导我们创造的成绩是非常伟大的。我在全国的七个省参加过射箭比赛，看到了数不清的大工厂，城市和农村都在飞速前进。就拿我国的体育事业来说吧！解放前外国人说我们是“东亚病夫”，现在我们不但有了完整的体育事业的体系，而且有了强大的思想红、技术精、作风硬的体育队伍，而且成绩是惊人的。我国的射箭运动虽有古老的传统，但在蒋介石反动政府的歧视、限制下已快绝迹了，党领导我们发展这个运动，我们说啥就能做到啥。我们从一九五九年建队以来的短短几年里，女子队就从帝国主义、修正主义垄断的十二项的世界纪录里夺回了七项。这铁的事实难道说是“吹牛皮”吹出来的吗？我们新中国的运动员，决对不容许邓拓之流这样猖狂地进攻！我们要在这场你死我活的社会主义文化大革命中，站在最前列，拉开革命的弓箭，坚决射垮他们开设的“三家村”黑店。
    邓拓黑帮狂妄极了，还叫喊要我们的党下台“休息”。正告你们：绝对办不到！党和毛主席永远是我们心中的红太阳。没有共产党，没有毛主席，就没有我们的活命。我出身于一个下中农的家里，过去过着吃不饱穿不暖的生活。解放后在党和毛主席的亲切关怀和教导下，我成为国家运动员，到过三个国家参加比赛。要是我在地主、资本家统治的旧社会，还不知会落到什么地步呢，还会有今天吗？我个人的成长，就是党和毛主席关怀教导的结果。我从毛主席著作里找到了方向、勇气和力量，懂得了为革命射箭，为人民服务的道理，把自己的一切和全国人民联系在一起，为党和人民争取崇高的荣誉。我在学习和运用毛主席指示的实践中，深深领悟了“人听毛主席的话，弓箭就听人的话”这条真理，因此我才有勇气克服了困难，有力量向世界纪录猛冲。几年来我们曾十一次打破了七项世界纪录，为党和国家争得了荣誉，有力地摧垮了帝国主义对国际体育运动的垄断。这都是党和毛主席给我们的。邓拓一伙想让我们不听党的话，简直是白天做梦。我们不但现在要听，而且永远要听。我们世世代代都要把毛主席的话当做最高指示。我们要牢牢掌握毛主席的阶级斗争的武器，坚决保卫人民江山，为中国革命和世界革命贡献出全部力量！
