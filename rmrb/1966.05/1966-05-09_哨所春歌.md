    Spring tides surge and billow,
    Towering mountains pierce the clouds,
    Peach blossoms smile, swallows fly,
    Spring arrives at the sentry post with a new look.
    The Four Good Banner flutters in the wind,
    Five Good Soldiers are on the island,
    Soldiers' hearts are filled with joy,
    Holding "Selected Works of Mao" with fervent passion.
    The Yan River flows long,
    Jinggang Mountain is even higher,
    It is Chairman Mao who points the direction for me,
    It is Chairman Mao who teaches me to sharpen my battle sword.
    Sentry post with guns at the ready, surveying the world,
    Revolutionary pulse throbbing on the bayonet tip,
    Storms brewing in places, red banners flying in others,
    Songs of triumph from all corners of the globe soar into the clouds!
    Songs of triumph from all corners of the globe soar into the clouds!
    People's soldiers are filled with high morale!
    Forever gripping our guns tightly,
    We will let the spring glow set the world ablaze!
