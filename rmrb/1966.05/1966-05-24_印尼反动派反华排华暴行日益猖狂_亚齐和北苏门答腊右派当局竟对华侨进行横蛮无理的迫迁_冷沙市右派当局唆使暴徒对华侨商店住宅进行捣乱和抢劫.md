    Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd, Jakarta Dispatch: Under the direction and with the connivance of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, the anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities of the right-wing authorities in Aceh Province and North Sumatra Province are escalating, openly carrying out arbitrary forced relocation of Overseas Chinese.
    On May 8th, a group of thugs held an anti-China rally in Kuala Simpang City, Aceh Province. The commander of the Indonesian First Military District openly clamored for the expulsion of Overseas Chinese at the rally. Subsequently, on May 13th, the Langsa military authorities in this province openly clamored at a gathering of Indonesian Chinese that the directors of Overseas Chinese community organizations must leave this area before June, and the general Overseas Chinese must all leave before August 17th, otherwise the safety of Overseas Chinese' lives will not be guaranteed.
    The Langsa military authorities also stated that Indonesian Chinese and Overseas Chinese members of a family cannot live in the same house. If a store is opened in one's own name as an Indonesian Chinese, but their parents or siblings are of Chinese nationality, they should be separated immediately, otherwise it will be regarded as a foreign shop.
    In the past ten days or so, some reactionary students and hooligans instigated by the right-wing authorities in Langsa City have frequently caused disturbances at Overseas Chinese shops and residences late at night, shouting anti-China slogans. Some even broke into houses and arbitrarily robbed goods and supplies.
    The authorities of Kota Cane City, North Sumatra Province, also unreasonably ordered the local Overseas Chinese to leave the city before June 30th. On May 17th, the North Sumatra military authorities also openly ordered the freezing of the Overseas Chinese General Association organizations within its jurisdiction and prohibited all their activities.
    Under the direction of the right-wing authorities, Kuomintang secret agents in Medan City, the provincial capital of North Sumatra Province, recently established a secret organization called the "Unified Action Organization to Smash Accomplices of the People's Republic of China" as a tool of the right-wing reactionary forces, specializing in engaging in the evil deeds of assassinating patriotic Overseas Chinese.

    印尼反动派反华排华暴行日益猖狂
    亚齐和北苏门答腊右派当局竟对华侨进行横蛮无理的迫迁  冷沙市右派当局唆使暴徒对华侨商店住宅进行捣乱和抢劫
    新华社二十三日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚右派军人政权的指使和纵容下，亚齐省和北苏门答腊省右派当局的反华排华暴行愈演愈烈，公然对华侨进行横蛮无理的迫迁。
    五月八日一批暴徒在亚齐省的瓜拉新邦市举行反华集会，印度尼西亚第一军区司令在集会上公开叫嚷要驱逐华侨。随后，五月十三日，这个省的冷沙军事当局在一次印尼籍华裔的集会上公然叫嚷，华侨社团理事必须于六月以前离开这个地区，一般华侨也必须于八月十七日前全部离开，否则华侨的生命安全将不予保障。
    冷沙军事当局还声言，一个家庭内的印尼籍华裔和华侨成员不能同居一屋，本人以印尼籍身份开设的商店，其父母或兄弟姊妹是中国籍的，应立即分离，否则即被视为外侨商店。
    最近十多天来，冷沙市右派当局唆使的一些反动学生和流氓，经常在深夜到华侨商店和住宅进行捣乱，狂呼反华口号，有的竟破门而入，任意抢劫货物和用品。
    北苏门答腊省哥达占尼市当局也无理限令当地华侨在六月三十日以前离开这个城市。五月十七日，北苏门答腊军事当局还公然下令冻结所辖区内华侨总会组织并禁止它们的一切活动。
    在右派当局的指使下，北苏门答腊省会棉兰市的蒋帮特务分子最近成立了一个叫做“粉碎中华人民共和国走卒统一行动机构”的秘密组织，作为右派反动势力的爪牙，专门从事暗害爱国华侨的罪恶勾当。
