    High Hanging Quotations Board
    Ai Furen, worker at Anshan Iron and Steel Metering Plant
    Chairman Mao's quotations board,
    Hangs high by our furnace,
    Every sentence is truth,
    Every word shines bright.
    Methods come from here,
    Power comes from here,
    The spring breeze rises from here,
    A hundred flowers bloom from here.
    Everyone wants to see it,
    Everyone loves it.
    Take a look before work,
    Feeling heroic and full of spirit,
    Arms full of strength,
    Leaping steps across the furnace.
    Sweat dripping down,
    Braving the clouds into the sea of fire,
    Steel drills compared to enthusiasm,
    Shovels competing in the race.
    The furnace fire claps and laughs,
    The red flag waves in the wind.
    Take a look after work,
    Fatigue flies beyond the sky,
    The masses find solutions,
    Innovation blossoms red flowers.
    Chairman Mao's quotations board,
    Hangs high by our furnace,
    The red sun shines brightly,
    Golden flowers bloom everywhere!
    Flames cheer in unison,
    Molten steel all cheers;
    Difficulties hurriedly surrender,
    Demons and monsters turn to dust.
    Hold the red flag high,
    March forward with big strides!

    高挂语录牌
    鞍钢计量厂工人　艾福仁主席语录牌，高挂咱炉台，句句是真理，字字放光彩。办法从这出，动力从这来，春风从这起，百花从这开。人人都愿看，个个都喜爱。上班看几眼，豪情满胸怀，两膀劲儿足，飞步跨炉台。汗水唰唰掉，披云闯火海，钢钎比干劲，铁锹来竞赛。炉火拍手笑，红旗迎风摆。下班看几眼，疲劳飞天外，群力找窍门，革新红花开。主席语录牌，高挂咱炉台，红日朗朗照，金花朵朵开！火苗齐欢呼，钢水都喝彩；困难忙投降，蛇神化尘埃。红旗高高举，阔步朝前迈！
