    Studying Chairman Mao's Writings Well is the Foundation for Strengthening Party Branch Construction

    To build a good Party branch, and to revolutionize the thinking of Party members and cadres, we must study Chairman Mao's writings and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the broad masses of Party members and cadres.
    Zhou Pengjiang, Secretary of the Party Branch of Sanzhou Brigade, Lianyi Commune, Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province

    Our brigade was a backward team before 1961. In April 1961, a new branch committee was established on the basis of rectification and transformation. How could the Party branch lead Party members and the masses to quickly change the backward situation of Sanzhou? At that time, the team had many problems and confused ideas, and we didn't know where to start. I read "On Contradiction" and learned that we must grasp the principal contradiction in complex things. But what was the principal contradiction in Sanzhou? I didn't understand it myself. So I went to consult the old poor peasant Zhou Guoxin with this question. I said, "Uncle Zhou, our team has been rectified. How should we improve production in the future?" Zhou Guoxin said, "It's good that the team has been rectified, but the Party members and cadres must have good thoughts, and their appearance must be upright, so that everyone will be energetic in production." The opinions of the masses helped me find the root of the problem. It was precisely because the branch had not grasped the Party's own construction for a long time, the problems of the Party members and cadres could not be solved, the masses had opinions, and their enthusiasm for production was not high, that the phenomena of "laxity, disorder, procrastination, carelessness, and superficiality" appeared in production. From this, we realized that the backwardness of collective production was mainly a matter of people's mental state, and the mental state of the people was determined by the self-construction and revolutionary degree of the Party branch.

    Sweetness

    How to build a good branch? How to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking? The key lies in the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's writings, and the use of Mao Zedong Thought to arm Party members and cadres. However, at first, I was not aware of this problem. I only realized it after practice. In 1961, because the rice stem borer control work was not grasped, production decreased by more than 40,000 jin compared with the previous year. At this time, some Party members and cadres developed negative emotions, and I myself had ideological burdens, and my family also held me back. Some masses were also a little disappointed in us. In this situation, whether to stand up or fall down, two thoughts swayed back and forth.

    I studied "Serve the People." I compared and examined myself. What Chairman Mao said is really good. He taught: "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." But now I am afraid when I encounter a little difficulty. Isn't this a lack of courage? How can this be like a Communist Party member? Chairman Mao's writings pointed out the direction for me and gave me strength and courage. Then, I told my learning experience to other branch committee members. They also studied and said, "Chairman Mao's writings can solve our ideological problems, and they will definitely solve the ideological problems of other Party members and cadres." So, the Party branch organized all Party members and cadres to study Chairman Mao's writings. Chairman Mao's book is really effective. What Chairman Mao says is worth thousands of words. Through one study, one listen, and one discussion, everyone's thinking was clear, and their consciousness was improved. After tasting the sweetness of learning, we often paid attention to finding answers from Chairman Mao's writings to solve problems when we encountered them.

    Method

    Through the study of articles such as "Serve the People," we further realized that to build a good branch, and to revolutionize the thinking of Party members and cadres, we must study Chairman Mao's writings and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of Party members and cadres. However, in the beginning, everyone's understanding of studying Chairman Mao's writings was not consistent. Some said, "I don't know many characters. How can I learn Chairman Mao's writings?" Some said, "The things in Chairman Mao's books are different in time, place, events, and objects. It doesn't matter much whether we farmers learn or not." How to solve these ideological problems? We organized everyone to recall and discuss: Why did the Chinese revolution succeed? Why could millet plus rifles defeat American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries equipped with airplanes and tanks? Why is our national construction so fast! Where is the reason? After discussion, everyone understood that without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution and construction could not have succeeded. Chairman Mao's books were written for us poor people. If we don't study them, who will! Everyone came to a conclusion: To become a true revolutionary, one must study Chairman Mao's writings. After unifying our thinking, we adopted the following methods: First, the branch committee members took the lead in learning, and the leaders set an example. Second, we advocated self-study, and gave praise to those who studied well, and established pacesetters. Third, we equipped learning tutors to read to Party members, cadres, and masses who did not know many characters. Fourth, we combined learning with work and meetings. Fifth, we held experience exchange meetings for studying Chairman Mao's writings to promote everyone's learning. Sixth, we studied with problems in mind, flexibly studied and applied, and firmly grasped the word "use." The specific learning method has six words: study, speak, listen, discuss, compare, do. In order to solve problems in a targeted manner, we organized everyone to study problems with generality, and individually designated articles to study for individual problems. For example, when it is difficult to be pessimistic and discouraged, we study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"; when we are easy to be proud and complacent in victory, we study "Get Rid of the Burden and Start the Machine." When we found that some Party members and cadres thought it was not worthwhile to be cadres, we organized the study of "Serve the People" to establish the thought of fearing neither hardship nor death, and wholeheartedly for the revolution. In a peaceful environment, some people's class views are easily weakened, so we organized the study of articles such as "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." When there are problems in the cadres' working methods and caring for the lives of the masses, we study articles such as "Concern for the Lives of the Masses and Attention to Working Methods." Yang Laitian, a member of the branch committee and captain of the fifth team, was a bit selfish and self-interested, and the masses called him "Xiao Zhanzi" [Little Occupier]. The branch asked him to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Through study, he compared and examined himself. At a meeting of commune members, he said: "Bethune was a foreigner who, without any selfish motives, regarded the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause... and I am a Party member, a member of the branch committee, and a production team leader. When something happens, I first plan for myself, am selfish and self-interested, and take advantage of the collective. How is this like a Communist Party member? I will strive to be a person who benefits the people in the future." Now Yang Laitian has greatly changed. The masses no longer call him "Xiao Zhanzi." They all say that he is a good captain.

    Effect

    In the past few years, through studying Chairman Mao's writings, learning from the Liberation Army, learning from Dazhai, and learning from Nanliu, the socialist thinking of the broad masses of cadres and masses has been greatly developed. Many Party members and cadres have gradually been able to consciously fight the word "I" in their thinking, fight the word "occupy" in the economy, fight the word "lazy" in labor, fight the word "mix" in work, and fight the word "gluttony" in life. Now the central topics of daily discussion have changed. More and more people are talking about revolution, talking about politics, talking about production, and talking about striving for progress. The style of not fearing hardship, not fearing tiredness, acting vigorously and resolutely, doing what is said, and doing well is gradually being cultivated. The Party branch has also been able to play a better role as a fighting fortress than before. The production outlook of the entire brigade has also changed.

### 学好毛主席著作是加强支部建设的根本

    学好毛主席著作是加强支部建设的根本
    要想把党支部建设好，要想使党员、干部思想革命化，必须学习毛主席著作，必须用毛泽东思想来武装广大党员、干部的头脑江苏省东台县廉贻公社三周大队党支部书记　周朋江启　发
    我们大队一九六一年以前是个落后队。一九六一年四月，在整顿改造的基础上，建立了新的支部委员会。党支部怎样领导党员和群众迅速地改变三周的落后面貌呢？当时，队里的问题多，思想乱，一时还不知道从那入手。我读了《矛盾论》，知道了在复杂的事物中要抓主要矛盾。但是什么是三周的主要矛盾？自己还不了解。于是我就带着问题去请教老贫农周国新。我说：“周爹，我们队经过整顿了，今后该怎样把生产搞好啊？”周国新说：“队整顿了不错，党员、干部思想要好，样子要正，大家才有劲搞生产。”群众的意见帮助我找到了问题的根子。正是因为支部长期没有抓党的自身建设，党员、干部中有问题不能解决，群众有意见，生产积极性不高，在生产上出现了“松、乱、拖、粗、浮”的现象。从这里使我们认识到集体生产的落后，主要是人的精神状态问题，而人的精神状态如何，又决定于党支部的自身建设和革命化程度。
      甜头
    怎样把支部建设好呢？怎样促进人的思想革命化呢？关键在于活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装党员、干部。但是，起初我对这个问题还不自觉，后来经过实践才有了认识。一九六一年因水稻治螟工作未抓住，比上年减产四万多斤。这时，有些党员、干部产生了消极情绪，我自己思想上也有包袱，家属也扯我的后腿，有些群众对我们也有点失望。在这种情况下，是站起来，还是倒下去，两种思想，摇摆不定。
    我学了《为人民服务》。对照检查了自己。毛泽东同志讲的话真好，他教导说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”可是，我现在碰到一点困难就怕起来，这不是没有勇气吗？这怎么象个共产党员呢？毛主席著作给我指明了方向，给我增添了力量和勇气。接着，我就把自己的学习心得告诉其他支部委员。他们也进行了学习，都说：“毛主席著作能解决我们的思想问题，也就一定能解决其他党员、干部的思想问题。”于是，党支部就组织全体党员、干部学习毛主席著作。毛主席的书真灵，毛主席说一句抵我们千句万句。通过一学一听一议，大家的思想就通了，觉悟就提高了。尝到了学习的甜头以后，我们碰到问题，就经常注意从毛主席著作中找答案，解决问题。办　法通过《为人民服务》等文章的学习，使我们进一步认识到要把支部建设好，要想使党员、干部思想革命化，必须学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装党员、干部的头脑。但是，在开始的时候，大家对学习毛主席著作的认识并不一致。有的说：“我识字不多，毛主席著作怎么学得进？”有的说：“毛主席的书中讲的事，时间、地点、事件、对象都不一样，我们种田人，学不学问题不大。”这些思想问题怎么解决呢？我们组织大家回忆讨论了：中国革命为什么会胜利？为什么小米加步枪能打败以飞机、坦克装备的美帝国主义和国民党反动派？为什么我们国家建设这样快！道理在哪里？经过讨论，大家明白了，没有毛泽东思想指导，革命和建设就不可能取得胜利，毛主席的书是为了我们穷人写的，我们不学哪个学！大家得出了一个结论：要使自己成为一个真正的革命者，非学习毛主席著作不可。思想统一了，我们就采取了以下办法：一是支部委员带头学，领导作样子。二是提倡自学，对学得好的给予表扬，树立标兵。三是配备了学习辅导员，读给识字不多的党员、干部、群众听。四是结合工作、结合会议学。五是开学习毛主席著作心得交流会，促使大家学。六是带着问题学，活学活用，狠抓“用”字。具体学习方法有六个字：学、讲、听、议、比、做。为了有针对性地解决问题，对有普遍性的问题，就组织大家学，个别人的问题，就个别指定文章学。例如，困难时容易悲观泄气，就学习《愚公移山》；胜利时容易骄傲自满，就学习《放下包袱，开动机器》。在发现有些党员、干部认为当干部不划算时，就组织学习《为人民服务》，树立一不怕苦，二不怕死，一心为革命的思想。在和平环境里，有些人阶级观点容易淡漠，就组织学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》等文章。在干部工作方法和关心群众生活方面有问题时，就学习《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等文章。支部委员、五队队长杨来田，有点自私自利，群众称他为“小占子”。支部就让他学习《纪念白求恩》。通过学习，他对照检查了自己，在一次社员会上说：“白求恩是一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业　而我是一个党员，又是支部委员、生产队长，一事当前，先替自己打算，自私自利，占集体的便宜，这那象一个共产党员的样子，我今后要努力做一个有利于人民的人。”现在杨来田大有转变，群众再不叫他“小占子”了，都说他是个好队长。效　果
    几年来，通过学习毛主席著作，又学解放军，学大寨，学南柳，广大干部和群众的社会主义思想大大发扬。很多党员、干部逐渐能够自觉地在思想上同“我”字作斗争，在经济上同“占”字作斗争，在劳动上同“懒”字作斗争，在工作上同“混”字作斗争，在生活上同“馋”字作斗争。现在大家日常议论的中心议题转了，讲革命，讲政治，讲生产，讲争上游的人越来越多，不怕苦，不怕累，雷厉风行，说干就干，干就干好的作风，正在逐渐培养起来。党支部也就比以前能更好地发挥战斗堡垒作用了。全大队的生产面貌也有了改变。
