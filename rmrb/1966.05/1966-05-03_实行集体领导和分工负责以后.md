    After Implementing Collective Leadership and Division of Responsibility
                  Henan Nanyang Prefectural Committee Finance and Trade Political Department
    The Party branch of the Xindian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nanyang County, Henan, has initially formed a strong fighting bastion with sound organization, a strong core, and active life, due to the implementation of the system of collective leadership and division of responsibility.
    Adhering to collective leadership is an important guarantee for implementing correct leadership. In recent years, this branch has adhered to this leadership principle very well. Zhou Zichao, the branch secretary, has a relatively democratic style. When convening branch committee meetings, he generally informs members of the meeting's content in advance and prepares for individual consultations. At each meeting, he strives to ensure that everyone can express their opinions freely, promote democracy, and make decisions according to the principle of the minority subordinating to the majority. He also attaches great importance to dissenting opinions, even if only a few people hold them. For differences in opinion, if they stem from a lack of thorough understanding of the spirit of higher authorities, they will re-study and discuss the relevant documents of the higher authorities to reach a consensus in understanding; if they stem from inaccurate understanding of the situation below, they will further present the situation, conduct analysis and research, or simply suspend the meeting to conduct investigations and research in practice, and then make a decision.
    While strengthening the collective leadership of the Party branch, they also pay special attention to the division of responsibility among branch committee members. In the past, the Party branch of the Xindian Supply and Marketing Cooperative also experienced a situation where the secretary was busy alone while other committee members had nothing to do. The main reasons were unclear division of labor and unclear responsibilities; the branch secretary was unwilling to let go and dared not boldly allow branch committee members to handle problems independently. Since 1964, the branch has taken many measures to address these issues. Branch committee members have clear divisions of labor. In addition to dividing labor within the Party according to secretary, organization, propaganda, supervision, trade union, youth, and united front work, the seven branch committee members are also responsible for certain administrative tasks. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over enterprises and strictly prevent the branch committee from falling into the trap of being mired in administrative affairs, they first clarified ideologically that they should focus on major issues in their work, which means focusing on the study of Chairman Mao's works and on the ideological and political education of the people.
    This not only promoted democracy but also clarified the direction and tasks, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the committee members. Now, every member of this branch is actively and responsibly involved in the work of the branch. Regardless of whether the branch secretary is at home or how many committee members are at home, even if only one branch committee member is at home, they can still preside over the work of the branch as usual. Branch committee member Wu Tiancai still presided over the branch meeting on the night before his transfer and stood the last shift with other comrades.
    Due to the implementation of the system of collective leadership and division of responsibility, not only has the fighting power of the branch been enhanced, but also the unity among branch committee members has been strengthened.

    实行集体领导和分工负责以后
                  河南南阳地委财贸政治部
    河南南阳县新店供销社党支部，由于贯彻了集体领导和分工负责的制度，初步形成了一个组织健全、核心较强、生活活跃的战斗堡垒。
    坚持集体领导，是实行正确领导的重要保证。近年来，这个支部很好地坚持了这一领导原则。支部书记周子超作风比较民主，召开支委会议，一般都能做到事前通知会议内容，作好个别酝酿工作。每次会议上既能做到各抒己见，发扬民主，又能按照少数服从多数的原则来作决议。对于不同意见，那怕只是少数人坚持，也很重视。对于分歧意见，要是来自对上级精神领会不透的，他们就重新学习讨论上级的有关文件，求得认识上的一致；要是来自对下情了解不准的，他们就进一步摆情况，进行分析研究，或者干脆把会议停下来到实际中去进行调查研究，然后再作决议。
    在加强党支部集体领导的同时，他们还特别注意支部委员的分工负责。新店供销社党支部过去也曾经出现过书记一人忙，其他委员没事干的状况。主要原因是分工不清，责任不明；支部书记不放手，不敢大胆让支部委员单独处理问题。一九六四年以来，支部针对这些问题采取了很多措施。支部委员实行明确的分工。七个支部委员除在党内分别按书记、组织、宣传、监察、工会、青年、统战等分工以外，还分别负责一定的行政工作。为了加强党对企业的领导，严防支部委员会陷于事务主义的圈子里，他们首先在思想上明确了在工作中要抓重大问题，也就是抓毛主席著作的学习，抓人的思想政治教育等主要问题。
    这样既发扬了民主，又明确了方向和任务，大大地调动了委员的积极性。现在这个支部的每一个成员，对支部工作都积极主动负责。不管支部书记在不在家，也不管在家的委员有多少，那怕只有一个支部委员在家，也能照常主持支部的工作。支部委员吴天才在调动工作的前一天晚上还照常主持支部会议，并且和其他同志一起，站完了最后一班岗。
    由于实行了集体领导和分工负责制度，不仅增强了支部的战斗力，也加强了支部委员之间的团结。
