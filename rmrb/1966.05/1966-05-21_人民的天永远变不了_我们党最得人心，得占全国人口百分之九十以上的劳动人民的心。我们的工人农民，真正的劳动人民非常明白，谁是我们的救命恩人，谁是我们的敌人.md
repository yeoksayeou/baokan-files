    The People's Sky Will Never Change
    Our Party is most popular, winning the hearts of over ninety percent of the working people in the country. Our workers and peasants, the real working people, understand very well who our saviors are and who our enemies are.
    Yuan Pinggao, Old Worker of Anyuan Coal Mine
    I am extremely angry after reading Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black talk. I am an ordinary old worker, and I will never allow bourgeois elements to lie through their teeth. Let us look at the historical facts!
    Deng Tuo attacks our Party's leadership as "self-righteous, looking down on the masses, always wanting to come up with their own ideas, trying to achieve unexpected victories, and not accepting the good opinions of the masses below." This is nonsense. I am seventy-four years old this year. I started working in the Pingxiang Coal Mine at the age of fifteen, and I have been with the Party ever since I joined the revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in 1922. In these decades, what has particularly moved me and what I have felt most deeply is the Party's mass line. In 1922, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao cared about us Anyuan workers. In order to rescue us from the eighteenth level of hell—the cruel rule of capitalists and feudal foremen—the Party sent Comrade Liu Shaoqi to organize the workers' movement. Comrade Liu Shaoqi lived with us in small shacks and consulted with us on everything. During the great strike in September of that year, the capitalists brought in a brigade of reactionary troops in an attempt to suppress the revolutionary movement. Comrade Liu Shaoqi studied the situation with us, listened to the opinions of the workers, organized workers' pickets to defend the strike struggle, and finally defeated the capitalists' conspiracies one after another, winning the victory of the great strike. After liberation, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and even the current socialist education movement, which one was not repeatedly explained to the masses, and discussed with us working people?
    Take our mine as an example. The mine's production plan, measures to complete tasks, allocation of employee housing, and arrangements for employee life are all studied through the workers' congress. In the old society, workers had no place to speak. Now, we can make suggestions and criticisms to the leadership, and the Party leadership attaches great importance to the opinions of our workers. Many innovations in our mine, such as underground small cableways and snap ring supports, were researched and reformed by the leadership and the masses together, and are still in use today. These ironclad facts cannot be erased by the likes of Deng Tuo.
    Deng Tuo slanders us as "relying on power, being tyrannical and domineering," and "unpopular." I say, our Party is the most popular, winning the hearts of over ninety percent of the working people in the country. Our workers and peasants, the real working people, understand very well who our saviors are and who our enemies are. The Communist Party led us to overthrow the landlords and capitalists, defeat the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and led us to turn over and become masters. We want to exercise dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and we want to implement "hegemony" against them. Our country today was won by the Communist Party leading us with blood. Deng Tuo wants our Party to "hurry up and take a complete rest, say nothing, and do nothing," which is to say he wants our Party to step down, and wants us the working class to give up this country won with blood and give it to bourgeois elements and revisionist elements. No, absolutely not. Deng Tuo, let me tell you, you want to change the sky, this is a dream, the people will not agree, our Anyuan workers will not agree. We will discredit and dig out all of you monsters and demons. Don't think I'm over seventy years old, if anyone opposes our Party or opposes socialist construction, I will definitely stand at the forefront of the battle and resolutely fight, and will not allow anyone to slander our Party.

    人民的天永远变不了
    我们党最得人心，得占全国人口百分之九十以上的劳动人民的心。我们的工人农民，真正的劳动人民非常明白，谁是我们的救命恩人，谁是我们的敌人
    安源煤矿老工人  袁品高
    看了邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话，使我非常气愤。我是一个普通的老工人，决不允许资产阶级分子瞪着眼睛说瞎话。让我们来看看历史事实吧！
    邓拓攻击我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众，不管什么事总是要自己出主意，企图出奇制胜，而不接受下面群众的好意见”。这是胡说。我今年七十四岁了。十五岁就到萍乡煤矿做工，一九二二年在中国共产党领导下参加了革命，几十年来一直没有离开过党。在这几十年里，使我特别感动和体会最深的是党的群众路线。一九二二年，共产党和毛主席关心我们安源工人，为了把我们从十八层地狱——资本家、封建把头的残酷统治下解救出来，党派刘少奇同志来组织工人运动。刘少奇同志和我们一起住在矮小的棚子里，事事和我们商量。那年九月大罢工的时候，资本家调来一旅反动军队，企图镇压革命运动，刘少奇同志和我们一起研究，听取了工人群众的意见，组织了工人纠察队，保卫罢工斗争，终于击败了资本家一个又一个阴谋诡计，取得大罢工的胜利。解放后，土改、镇反、肃反、三反、五反以至现在的社会主义教育运动，那一次不是反复向群众交代政策，和我们劳动人民共同商量呢？
    拿我们矿上来说，矿上的生产计划，完成任务的措施，职工住宅分配，职工生活安排，每一件都通过职工代表大会研究。在旧社会，工人没有说话的地方。现在，我们可以向领导提意见提批评，党的领导非常重视我们工人群众的意见。我们矿的井下小缆道、卡环支架等许多革新，就是领导和群众一起研究改革的，现在一直在使用。这些铁的事实，是邓拓之流抹煞不了的。
    邓拓诬蔑我们“依靠权势，蛮横逞强”、“不得人心”。我说，我们党最得人心，得占全国人口百分之九十以上的劳动人民的心。我们工人农民，真正的劳动人民非常明白，谁是我们的救命恩人，谁是我们的敌人。共产党领导我们斗倒地主资本家，打垮蒋介石反动派，领导我们翻身作主人。我们要对地、富、反、坏、右专政，要对他们实行“霸道”。我们今天的江山，是共产党领导我们用鲜血换来的。邓拓要我们党“赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做”，就是要我们党下台，要我们工人阶级把这鲜血换来的江山让出去，送给资产阶级分子、修正主义分子。不能，万万不能。邓拓，告诉你，你想要变天，这是做梦，人民不会答应，我们安源工人不会答应。我们要把你们这些牛鬼蛇神搞臭、挖尽。别看我今年七十多岁，谁要反对我们的党，反对社会主义建设，我一定要站在战斗的最前列，坚决进行斗争，不容许任何人诬蔑我们的党。
