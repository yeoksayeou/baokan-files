    For several years, Deng Tuo, with one hand firmly grasping newspapers and periodicals like "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," has fired a barrage of concealed arrows at our great Party, great people, and great leader. Simultaneously, with his other hand, he tightly seized opportunities during municipal meetings, using his position as a municipal leader to disseminate, under false pretenses, much poisonous juice against Marxism, Mao Zedong Thought, and socialism to cadres at all levels in the education sector. After reading Comrade Qi Benyu's "Critique of the Bourgeois Standpoint of 'Frontline' and 'Beijing Daily,'" especially the following sentences: "Who exactly is Deng Tuo? It has now been verified that he is a traitor who infiltrated the Party during the Anti-Japanese War," we suddenly realized why, in September 1963, Deng Tuo, at a meeting of municipal, county, and middle school rural education cadres convened by the Education Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, while addressing comrades' questions regarding the study of central documents on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, suddenly spoke at length about the Li Xiucheng issue.
    In 1963, when the masses were vehemently criticizing the so-called "Loyal King" Li Xiucheng as a traitorous defector, Deng Tuo felt deeply unjust, because criticizing Li Xiucheng was precisely exposing Deng Tuo's own scars. Possessing rich counter-revolutionary strategies, Deng Tuo did not dare to blatantly bare his arms and fight, but instead, presuming to be clever, he utilized the opportunity to summarize the conference to secretly insert his unmentionable private agenda. Today, the truth is revealed: it is not surprising that a traitor defends another traitor!
    At this meeting, Deng Tuo repeatedly attacked Comrade Qi Benyu, who wrote articles criticizing Li Xiucheng, while simultaneously whitewashing Li Xiucheng, the traitor who defected to the enemy.
    Deng Tuo said: "After Li Xiucheng was captured by Zeng Guofan, he wrote tens of thousands of words of confession, scolding the Qing government and the foreign devils, resolutely opposing the Qing and imperialism, which is rare," and "we must affirm his aspect as a people's hero." It is not difficult to see that Deng Tuo wanted us to affirm in classrooms to young people that Li Xiucheng was a hero, a role model for learning, even if he became a traitor, it was still "rare."
    Deng Tuo also deliberately excused Li Xiucheng, saying that his "betrayal of the revolution was a backward aspect of the peasantry," and "was the backwardness of the peasants." This is simply an insult to the broad masses of peasants in our country. Chairman Mao said: "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced the peasants to hold multiple uprisings to resist the rule of the landlord class... In Chinese feudal society, only this kind of class struggle of the peasants, the peasant uprisings, and peasant wars are the true driving force of historical development." Deng Tuo sang precisely the opposite tune, he "instructed" us to educate students: peasants are backward, and it is natural for peasant revolutionary leaders to betray the revolution, there is no need to be surprised, it is not blameworthy.
    Deng Tuo said that we "cannot exaggerate a little, negate everything" about Li Xiucheng, "even if ninety percent is wrong and ten percent is right, we must affirm it, this is the historical materialist viewpoint." According to Deng Tuo's logic, the great traitor Wang Jingwei should also be affirmed, the right-leaning opportunist Chen Duxiu should also be affirmed, the revolutionary traitor Zhang Guotao should also be affirmed, and that small handful of right-leaning opportunists are also "rare heroes." Defection to the enemy is a major issue of right and wrong between revolution and counter-revolution, how can it be said to be "exaggerating a little, negating everything"? How can those counter-revolutionary traitors be affirmed? Whose historical materialist viewpoint is this? This is a thoroughgoing bourgeois, revisionist viewpoint!
    Deng Tuo repeatedly said: "This issue (referring to the Li Xiucheng issue) should not be debated further, there is no benefit in debating it," and such debate is "politically unfavorable." What is bad about debating? Chairman Mao said: "Marxists should not be afraid of anyone's criticism. On the contrary, Marxists should temper themselves, develop themselves, and expand their positions in the midst of people's criticism, that is, in the storms of struggle." The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, only people like Deng Tuo, with a guilty conscience, fear exposing their fox tails.
    We educators will absolutely not allow Deng Tuo to use the Party's prestige to peddle his private agenda. We must settle accounts for all the poisons that Deng Tuo has instilled in us. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in the struggle, and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois and revisionist ideological influence of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and others on the broad masses of young people.

    邓拓为李秀成的变节辩解
    刘仙舟
    几年来，邓拓一只手抓住《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》等报刊，向我们伟大的党、伟大的人民、伟大的领袖射出了大量的暗箭。同时，他的另一只手，又紧紧抓住市里召开各种会议的机会，以市委领导人的身份，以假代真，向教育界各级干部散放了许多反对马克思主义、毛泽东思想，反对社会主义的毒汁。读了戚本禹同志《评〈前线〉〈北京日报〉的资产阶级立场》，特别是其中以下几句话：“邓拓是一个什么人？现在已经查明，他是一个叛徒，在抗日战争时期又混进党内。”我们才恍然想起，为什么一九六三年九月，邓拓在中共北京市委教育部召开的市、县、中学农村教育三级干部会议上，代表市委解答同志们学习中央文件问题时，突然大讲起李秀成问题。
    在一九六三年，群众纷纷对所谓“忠王”李秀成这个变节投敌分子进行口诛笔伐的时候，邓拓是满心的不平，因为批了李秀成，正是揭在邓拓的疮疤上。而具有丰富反革命策略的邓拓，没有敢明目张胆地赤膊上阵，却自以为巧妙地利用给大会做总结之便，偷偷地塞进了他见不得天日的私货。今天，真相大白：叛徒替叛徒辩解，一点也不奇怪！
    邓拓在这次会上，一再攻击写批判李秀成文章的戚本禹同志，同时一再为变节投敌的叛徒李秀成涂脂抹粉。
    邓拓说：“李秀成被曾国藩捉住之后，写了几万字的自供，骂满清政府，骂洋鬼子，反清反帝很坚决，这是难得的”，“要肯定他人民英雄的一面”。不难看出，邓拓要我们在课堂上，向青少年肯定李秀成是英雄，是学习的榜样，即使当了叛徒，也是“难得的”。
    邓拓还故意为李秀成开脱说，他“叛变革命是农民落后的一面”，“是农民的落后性”。这简直是对我国广大农民的侮辱。毛主席说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。……在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”邓拓刚好唱的是反调，他“指示”我们教育学生：农民是落后的，农民革命领袖叛变革命是很自然的，无须大惊小怪，是无可责难的。
    邓拓说，对李秀成“不能夸大一点，否定一切”，“百分之九十是错的，百分之十是对的，也要肯定，这是历史唯物主义观点”。按照邓拓的逻辑，大汉奸汪精卫也该肯定了，右倾机会主义的陈独秀也该肯定了，革命的叛徒张国焘也该肯定了，那一小撮右倾机会主义分子也是“难得的英雄”了。投敌变节是革命与反革命的大是大非问题，怎么能说是“夸大一点，否定一切”呢？对那些反革命叛徒，怎么能够肯定呢？这是哪家的历史唯物主义观点？这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级、修正主义观点！
    邓拓反复地说：“这个问题（指李秀成问题）不要再争了，争没有什么好处”，这样争“对政治上不利”。争有什么不好？毛主席说：“马克思主义者不应该害怕任何人批评。相反，马克思主义者就要在人们的批评中间，就是要在斗争的风雨中间，锻炼自己，发展自己，扩大自己的阵地。”真理越争越明，只有邓拓之流，做贼心虚，唯恐露出他的狐狸尾巴。
    我们教育工作者绝不允许邓拓借用党的威信，大贩其私货。我们要清算邓拓向我们灌输的一切毒素，我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加斗争，彻底清除邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙等人对广大青少年的资产阶级、修正主义思想影响。
