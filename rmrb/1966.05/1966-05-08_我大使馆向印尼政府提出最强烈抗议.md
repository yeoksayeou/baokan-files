    Indonesian Government Organizes Thugs to Illegally Seize Our Consulate in Makassar Again
    Our Embassy Lodges Strongest Protest with Indonesian Government
    Points out that the Indonesian government is further taking extremely arrogant actions, pushing the relations between the two countries to a complete rupture, and exposing the lie of so-called "willingness to maintain good and normal relations with China."
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: Jakarta news: The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia delivered a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 7th, lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the extremely serious incident of Indonesian right-wing thugs, in coordination with the military police, destroying and seizing the Chinese Consulate in Makassar on the 4th. The full text of the note is as follows:
    To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia:
    The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia and states the following regarding the extremely serious incident of Indonesian right-wing thugs, in coordination with the military police, destroying and seizing the Chinese Consulate in Makassar:
    At 2:30 p.m. on May 4, 1966, more than 30 Indonesian right-wing thugs, carrying clubs and other weapons, jumped over the wall into the courtyard of the Chinese Consulate in Makassar, pried open the three doors of the consulate hall, burned a large number of books and newspapers in the lawn, and damaged the furnishings inside the consulate. The thugs also openly hung the Indonesian flag and a large horizontal cloth banner reading "Kami Headquarters" on the flagpole of the consulate hall roof, and declared to the Chinese employees of the consulate that they had been ordered to occupy the building. The Chinese consul's car was even snatched by personnel sent by the Makassar base command. The thugs also repeatedly threatened the Chinese employees, took all the keys to the rooms, and on the same afternoon, drove all the employees and their families out of the consulate. During the above-mentioned atrocities, armed military police were present to assist and cooperate.
    The Embassy solemnly points out that after the Indonesian government organized reactionary thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy, there have been as many as six incidents of destroying and seizing the Commercial Counselor's Office, the Military Attaché's Office, the Embassy dormitory, and the office and dormitory of the Chinese Consulate General. Now, the Chinese Consulate in Makassar has been illegally seized again. This series of atrocities fully proves that the Indonesian government is further taking extremely arrogant actions from all aspects, pushing the relations between the two countries to a complete rupture, and has itself exposed the lie of so-called "willingness to maintain good and normal relations with China." The Indonesian government instigated and organized a series of anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, unprecedentedly trampling on the norms of international relations, which cannot be concealed by any rhetoric and cannot escape guilt in any way.
    The Chinese Embassy lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the above-mentioned serious incident. The Embassy also demands that the Indonesian government immediately drive away the thugs who have seized the Chinese Consulate in Makassar, compensate for all losses, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. The Embassy reserves the right to make further demands.
    With the highest respect.

    印尼政府又组织暴徒非法霸占我驻望加锡领事馆
    我大使馆向印尼政府提出最强烈抗议
    指出印尼政府正在进一步采取极其狂妄的行动，把两国关系推向完全破裂，自行揭穿了所谓“愿意同中国保持良好的正常关系”的谎言
    新华社七日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆七日向印度尼西亚外交部递交了一份照会，就印度尼西亚右派暴徒在军警配合下四日破坏和霸占中国驻望加锡领事馆的极端严重事件，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会全文如下：
    印度尼西亚共和国外交部：
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆向印度尼西亚共和国外交部致意，并就印度尼西亚右派暴徒在军警配合下破坏和霸占中国驻望加锡领事馆的极端严重事件，申述如下：
    一九六六年五月四日下午二时三十分，印度尼西亚右派暴徒三十余人，携带棍棒等凶器，翻墙跳入中国驻望加锡领事馆院内，撬开领事馆大厅的三座门，在草坪上焚烧了领事馆的大批书报，破坏了馆内的陈设，暴徒们还公然在领事馆大厅屋檐的旗杆上悬挂了印度尼西亚的国旗和写着“卡米总部”的大幅横布，对领事馆的中国雇员宣称，他们已经奉命占领了这所房屋。中国领事的汽车竟被望加锡基地司令部派人抢走，暴徒还对中国雇员百般恫吓，拿去所有房间的钥匙，并在当天下午，将雇员和他的家属全部赶出领事馆。在上述暴行发生时，有武装军警多人在场协助配合。
    大使馆严正指出：在印度尼西亚政府组织反动暴徒武装袭击中国大使馆后，连续发生了破坏和霸占中国大使馆商务参赞处、武官处、大使馆宿舍、中国总领事馆的办公处和宿舍达六起之多，现在又非法霸占了中国驻望加锡领事馆。这一系列暴行，完全证明了印度尼西亚政府正在进一步从各个方面采取极其狂妄的行动，将两国关系推向完全破裂，并且自己揭穿了所谓“愿意同中国保持良好的正常关系”的谎言。印度尼西亚政府指使和组织了一系列反华、排华的罪行，史无前例地蹂躏了国际关系的准则，是任何花言巧语都掩盖不了的，是无论如何也逃避不了罪责的。
    中国大使馆对上述严重事件向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，大使馆并要求印度尼西亚政府立即赶走霸占中国驻望加锡领事馆的暴徒，赔偿一切损失，保证今后不再发生类似事件。大使馆保留提出进一步要求的权利。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
    中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆
    一九六六年五月七日
