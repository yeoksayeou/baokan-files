　　Ugandan President Announces New Cabinet Composition
　　Kampala dispatch: Ugandan President Obote announced the formation of a new Ugandan cabinet on April 30.
　　The new cabinet consists of the President, Vice President, and seventeen other ministers, including seven new ministers.
　　It was announced that Obote would continue to serve as President, and Babiiha would serve as Vice President and Minister of Animal Husbandry and Game.
　　President Obote announced that the aforementioned list of appointments would take effect from May 1.
　　Kenyan Parliament Passes Constitutional Amendment
　　Nairobi dispatch: After nine and a half hours of intense debate at an emergency meeting on April 28, the Kenyan House of Representatives passed a constitutional amendment stipulating that members of parliament who announce their withdrawal from the Kenya African National Union must resign their seats. On the same day, the Senate also passed this amendment.
　　This amendment was proposed by members of parliament supporting the Kenyan government after a number of members of the ruling Kenya African National Union recently announced their withdrawal from the party and the formation of a new party. Members of parliament who announced their withdrawal from the party include former Kenyan Vice President Oginga Odinga, Kenyan Minister of Information Oneko, Deputy Minister of Finance Okelo-Odongo, and Deputy Minister of the Vice President's Office Waiyaki, who recently resigned.
　　French Regulations Require US Military Personnel Stationed in France to Pay Taxes
　　Paris dispatch: The French government tax center stipulated that, starting from April 15, allied personnel "permanently stationed" in France—mainly Americans—must pay a tax equivalent to 10.25 percent of their private vehicle insurance premiums. United Press International believes that this is "a blow" from the French government to the thousands of American soldiers who are about to be driven out of France, who were previously exempt from this tax.
　　Spanish People Launch Anti-Dictatorial Struggle
　　Madrid dispatch: In Barcelona, a major city in northeastern Spain with a tradition of popular struggle, a struggle against fascist dictatorship and for democratic rights and living rights broke out on the eve of May Day.
　　On April 30, the masses in this city held demonstrations to fight for freedom and demand higher wages. The authorities hastily dispatched armed police to violently suppress the demonstrating masses.

    新内阁由总统、副总统和另外十七个部长组成，其中有七个是新部长。

    肯尼亚议会通过宪法修正案
    内罗毕消息：肯尼亚众议院四月二十八日在紧急会议上经过九个半小时的激烈辩论后，通过一项宪法修正案，规定宣布退出肯尼亚非洲民族联盟的议员都要辞去议席。同一天，参议院也通过了这项修正案。
    这项修正案是在执政党肯尼亚非洲民族联盟的一批议员最近相继宣布退出这个政党并另成立新党之后，由支持肯尼亚政府的议员提出的。宣布退出这个党的议员中，包括最近辞职的前肯尼亚副总统奥廷加、肯尼亚政府新闻部长奥内科、财政部副部长奥凯洛·奥东戈、副总统办公室副部长韦亚基等。
    法规定要驻法美军人员交税
    巴黎消息：法国政府税收中心规定，从四月十五日开始，“常驻”法国的盟国人员——主要是美国人——要缴纳相当于他们私人车辆保险费的百分之十点二五的捐税。合众国际社认为：这是法国政府对成千上万即将被撵出法国的美军的“一个打击”，他们从前是免交这种捐税的。
