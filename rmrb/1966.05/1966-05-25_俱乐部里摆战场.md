    Setting up a Battlefield in the Club
    Soldier Xing Shudi

Spring night in the military camp is not peaceful,
The club is seething with people.
Slogans in red characters gleam on the wall poster:
Participate in the Great Cultural Revolution.
The newspaper reader reads the newspaper first,
All the soldiers in the company listen carefully.
After reading, a great discussion unfolds,
The sound of voices is like spring thunder rumbling.
If it is poisonous weed, it must be eradicated,
No leniency for the enemy;
Resolutely open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line,
Never withdraw until complete victory!
Setting up a battlefield in the club,
The soldiers sing the strongest sound:
Vowing to be vanguards of the Cultural Revolution,
"Selected Works of Mao" is the guiding light.

    俱乐部里摆战场
    战士　邢书第春夜军营不平静，俱乐部里人沸腾。墙报上面红字闪：参加文化大革命。读报员先读报纸，全连战士仔细听。读完展开大讨论，话音好似春雷鸣。是毒草就要铲除，对敌人绝不留情；坚决向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，不获全胜不收兵！俱乐部里摆战场，战士高唱最强音：誓当文化革命的闯将，毛选”就是指路灯。
