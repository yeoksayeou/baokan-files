    Xinhua News Agency, London, May 23rd – The British merchant seamen's strike entered its second week on the 23rd, and all British ports are paralyzed.
    Of the 2,500 merchant ships in Britain, 600 are now paralyzed in various ports, and the number of striking seamen has increased to 13,000. Other merchant ships will join the strike as they return from foreign countries to British ports.
    London port is already congested with 259 ships. On the evening of the 22nd, ten ships were lined up in a row on the Thames River waiting to dock. At the same time, more ships are preparing to enter the port to join the strike, and the situation will be even more serious this week.
    Over the weekend, striking seamen set up picket lines in ports across the country. In Belfast, 2,000 seamen held rallies and demonstrations. 1,500 seamen from ports in northeastern England gathered in South Shields to demonstrate.
    On the morning of the 21st, many seamen held demonstrations with placards in Plymouth's main commercial center.
    It is estimated that British merchant ships carry approximately 60 million pounds worth of exports each week, and due to last week's strike, approximately 40 million pounds worth of exports could not be shipped. This will add to the difficulties in Britain's international trade balance.
    At present, despite the Labour government's constant pressure and threats to declare a "national state of emergency," the striking seamen still insist on their legitimate demands for improved working conditions and increased wages.
    Various trade union organizations in Britain have sent telegrams and passed resolutions in support of the seamen's strike. (Attached picture)
    British merchant seamen have been on strike since May 16, and are continuing to persist and expand it. The strike has paralyzed all British ports and a quarter of the country's merchant ships, causing significant losses to the British economy, which has always relied on import and export trade. The picture shows the scene of the seamen's strike in Liverpool, England.

    英海员坚持罢工全国港口陷于瘫痪
    新华社伦敦二十三日电  英国商船海员大罢工二十三日进入第二周，英国所有的港口都陷于瘫痪。
    在英国总共二千五百艘商船中，现在已经有六百只船瘫痪在各港口，参加罢工的海员增加到一万三千人。其他商船将在它们从国外返回英国港口时陆续参加罢工。
    伦敦港已经拥塞了二百五十九只船，二十二日晚上有十只船在泰晤士河上排成一字长蛇阵等候停泊。同时，更多的船只准备进港参加罢工，本周情况将更加严重。
    在上周末，罢工的海员在全国各港口布置了纠察线。在贝尔法斯特，二千名海员举行集会和示威游行。来自英格兰东北部各港口的一千五百名海员聚集在南希尔兹示威。
    二十一日上午，许多海员拿着标语牌在普利茅斯的主要商业中心举行示威。
    据估计，英国商船每周运载大约价值六千万英镑的出口货物，由于上星期的罢工，大约价值四千万英镑的出口货物运不出去。这将给英国的国际贸易收支困难增添不利的影响。
    目前，尽管工党政府不断施加压力并且以宣布“全国紧急状态”进行威胁，但是罢工的海员们仍然坚持他们提出的改善工作条件和增加工资的正当要求。
    英国的各工会组织纷纷打电报并且通过决议声援这次海员罢工。（附图片）
    英国商船海员从五月十六日起开始举行罢工，目前仍在坚持和扩大中。这次罢工使英国所有港口和全国四分之一的商船都陷于瘫痪，使一向依靠进出口贸易的英国经济遭到重大的损失。图为英国利物浦港口的海员罢工情景。
