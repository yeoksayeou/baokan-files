    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 26th -- Before leaving here to return home, Andrew Chou, head of the Canada-China Friendship Association delegation, told our reporter that he was deeply impressed by China's tremendous achievements in economic construction. He said that he saw this country, which was built on the ruins of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society in 1949, now manufacturing a 12,000-ton hydraulic press by itself. China has made great achievements in industry, agriculture, culture and education, medical care, sports, and even social welfare. Everywhere he went, he could see the Chinese people overcoming various difficulties left over by the past reactionary government and achieving victory in socialist construction. He said that people told him: These victories were achieved because of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the mastery of Mao Zedong Thought by the people. After a month of observation, I have no reason to doubt this statement.

    Andrew Chou said that what impressed him most during his visit to China was that people were studying Chairman Mao Zedong's works and cultivating new socialist talents who completely disregard personal interests and work for the interests of others. He said that bourgeois psychologists and sociologists believe that people are selfish and cannot be changed. However, in China, people have been cultivated who completely disregard personal interests and work for the interests of others. In this regard, people regard Bethune as an example and learn from his spirit of internationalism.

    Andrew Chou and the delegation he led were invited to China by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations. Before leaving Guangzhou to return home, the delegation members shared their impressions of their visit to China with our reporters. Delegation members Dennison, Mrs. Easter, and Aral pointed out to our reporter that they were deeply impressed by the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in implementing the policy of self-reliance. Dennison said that the self-reliance policy formulated by the Chinese Communist Party is completely correct and is the only correct policy for building an independent and strong socialist China. The people of other countries must also adopt the policy of self-reliance if they want to make their countries truly independent and autonomous. Mrs. Easter said that the Chinese people have studied Chairman Mao Zedong's works, applied Mao Zedong Thought, raised their political consciousness, and earnestly implemented the policy of self-reliance, thus achieving great economic achievements and being able to be completely independent and autonomous politically. She said that China's recent nuclear explosion is a victory of this spirit of self-reliance. Another member of the delegation, Aral, said that this is also a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Dennison also talked about the struggle against modern revisionism. He said that the main obstacle in the current struggle of the world's people against US imperialism is Soviet revisionism. While carrying out the struggle against US imperialism, the people of the world must launch a struggle against modern revisionism. He said that in order for the struggle against US imperialism to be victorious, the people of the world must launch struggles on all fronts.

    In his speech, delegation member Kleven refuted the claim that China is isolated. He said that US imperialism and reactionaries want to isolate China, but the people of the world will not allow China to be isolated, and China cannot be isolated. He also emphasized that China's third nuclear test was a victory of great significance, a victory for the oppressed people. The delegation has recently left Guangzhou to return home.

    加中友协代表团团长和团员赞扬我国自力更生精神
    中国建设成就是毛泽东思想的胜利
    全国人民学习毛主席著作培养毫不利己专门利人的新人材
    世界人民不许孤立中国，中国是孤立不了的
    新华社广州二十六日电  加拿大—中国友好协会代表团团长安德鲁·周在离开这里回国前对本社记者说，中国经济建设的巨大成就给他留下了深刻的印象。他说，他看到这个一九四九年在半封建、半殖民地废墟上建立起来的国家现在自己制造出了一万二千吨水压机。中国在工业、农业、文教、医疗、体育运动以至社会福利方面都取得了很大的成就。到每一个地方，都能看到中国人民在克服过去反动政府遗留下来的各种各样的困难，取得了社会主义建设的胜利。他说，人们告诉我：取得这些胜利是由于中国共产党的正确领导和毛泽东思想被人们所掌握的结果。我经过一个月的观察，没有理由怀疑这种说法。
    安德鲁·周说，他在中国访问期间印象最深的是人们都在学习毛泽东主席的著作，并且培养出了完全不考虑个人利益、为着别人的利益而工作的新的社会主义人材。他说，资产阶级的心理学家和社会学家认为人都是自私的，而且是不能改变的。但是，在中国却培养出了完全不考虑个人利益，为着别人的利益而工作的人。在这方面，人们把白求恩看做榜样，学习他的国际主义精神。
    安德鲁·周和他率领的代表团是应中国人民对外文化友好协会邀请来我国参加“五一”国际劳动节庆祝活动的。代表团在离开广州回国前向本社记者谈到了他们的访华观感。代表团团员丹纽森、依斯特夫人和阿乐尔在向本社记者谈话时指出，他们对中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下执行自力更生方针所取得的巨大成就，有着深刻的印象。丹纽森说，中国共产党制定的自力更生方针是完全正确的，是建立一个独立、强大的社会主义中国的唯一正确的政策，其他国家的人民要使他们国家能真正独立自主，也必须采取自力更生的方针。依斯特夫人说，中国人民学习毛泽东主席的著作，运用毛泽东思想，提高了政治觉悟，认真地执行了自力更生的方针，因而在经济上取得了很大的成就，在政治上能够完全独立自主。她说，最近中国进行的核爆炸，就是这种自力更生精神的胜利。代表团的另一位团员阿乐尔说，这也是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    丹纽森还谈到了反对现代修正主义的斗争。他说，在当前世界人民反对美帝国主义斗争中存在的主要障碍是苏联修正主义。全世界人民在进行反对美帝国主义斗争的同时，必须展开反对现代修正主义的斗争。他说，为了使反对美帝国主义斗争取得胜利，世界人民必须在各个战线上展开斗争。
    代表团团员克莱文在谈话中驳斥了所谓中国受到孤立的说法，他说，美帝国主义和反动派想孤立中国，但是世界人民不许孤立中国，中国是孤立不了的。他还强调指出，中国的第三次核试验是一次有重大意义的胜利，是被压迫人民的胜利。代表团已在最近离开广州回国。
