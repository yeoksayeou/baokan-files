    Collection of Weedings
    In the past, this place was a wilderness. During the Great Leap Forward years, we overcame numerous difficulties, built factories, and produced a large number of tractors. The "Dongfanghong" we produced became popular all over the country and even reached many countries in the world. We want to ask Deng Tuo, without the Great Leap Forward, would we have all this? If we say our factory only had "an egg's worth of possessions" at the beginning, now it has "a flock of chickens and ducks" and is making increasingly greater contributions to the cause of socialism. It is not "an egg's worth of possessions" that was "completely destroyed," but the anti-Party elements who predicted that "an egg's worth of possessions" would be "completely destroyed."

    In our village, there was a local tyrant landlord named Cui Jingui. When we wanted to set up an agricultural cooperative, he scolded us: "Turning from poor to rich, bragging!" After the agricultural cooperative was set up, we worked hard to dig ditches to drain water and control alkali, he scolded us again: "Digging ditches to control alkali, bragging!" After the ditching and alkali control succeeded, we were determined to achieve a per-mu yield of grain exceeding the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and he came out to scold us again: "Wanting to harvest four or five hundred catties of grain per mu, bragging!" Why do landlords say the same things that Deng Tuo says? This is because Deng Tuo has the same kind of head as a landlord, so of course he will have the same kind of tone as a landlord.

    In the most vicious article slandering the Great Leap Forward, "An Egg's Worth of Possessions," Deng Tuo specifically pointed out that the "city dweller's" egg "was picked up," "This fact is not glorious in itself." Here, Deng Tuo's reactionary stance is most nakedly exposed. Our revolutionary people, after a long period of arduous struggle, overthrew the three great enemies and confiscated the wealth that imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism had plundered from our people, making it the property of the people. This is completely justified, but why does Deng Tuo curse us as "not glorious"? It turns out that he is speaking for the exploiting class elements who have lost their "possessions."
                    Sun Lixian, Xiji Middle School, Tong County, Beijing
    In "Yanshan Night Talks," Deng Tuo, using the voice of a dead man, wrote with murderous intent: "Ten years to grind a sword, the sharp edge has not been tested; today I show it to you, who has grievances?" From this coded language, we hear the curses and grinding sounds of class enemies. In fact, Deng Tuo has already raised knives and guns to rebel in the cultural field, he even wants to use wooden sticks to hit our heads until we "pass out." Our response to this rampant attack by class enemies is: the enemy sharpens the knife and so do we, if the enemy attacks we will give a devastating counterattack.
                  Zhang Quanfang, Company Commander of "Hard-Boned Sixth Company"
    Deng Tuo everywhere trumpets "not scolding people," but what about himself? Today he scolds the great Party as "a Zhuge Liang with juice," tomorrow he scolds the Great Leap Forward as "bragging"... What is the difference between this and those landlord elements who are full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but are actually full of male prostitutes and female thieves! It seems that Deng Tuo's words and actions are very inconsistent. He wants us to "not scold people," but in reality, he wants us not to expose the crimes of these demons and monsters who oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Our answer is: to class enemies, we will always "scold," expose, and struggle, and never stop.

    锄草集
    从前，我们这里是一片荒野。在大跃进的几年里，我们克服了重重困难，建起了工厂，并生产出大量的拖拉机。我们生产的“东方红”红遍了祖国四面八方，还红到了世界好多国家。我们要问邓拓，没有大跃进能有这一切吗？如果说我们工厂在刚开始的时候只有“一个鸡蛋的家当”，那么现在已经“鸡鸭成群”了，并且正在为社会主义事业做出越来越大的贡献。“完全毁掉”的不是“一个鸡蛋的家当”，而是预言“一个鸡蛋的家当”要“完全毁掉”的反党分子。

    俺村有个恶霸地主叫崔金贵。我们要办农业社，他就骂我们：“由穷变富哩，吹牛皮！”农业社办起来了，我们大搞挖沟排涝治碱，他又骂我们：“挖沟治碱哩，吹牛皮！”挖沟排涝治碱成功了，我们决心要实现粮食亩产量过黄河、过长江，他又出来骂我们：“想一亩地收四五百斤粮食哩，吹牛皮！”为什么地主说啥话，邓拓也说啥话呢？这是因为邓拓是长着同地主一个样的脑袋，当然也就会是同地主一个样的腔调了。
        河南安阳县南崔庄大队崔凤梧张广礼
    在《一个鸡蛋的家当》这一篇最恶毒地污蔑大跃进的文章里，邓拓特别指明那个“市人”的鸡蛋“是拾来的”，
  “这个事实本来就不光采”。这里最赤裸裸地暴露了邓拓的反动立场。我国革命人民经过长期艰苦奋斗，打倒了三大敌人，没收了帝国主义、官僚资本主义从我国人民手中掠夺去的财富，为人民所有，这本来是完全正当的，邓拓为什么要咒骂我们“不光采”呢？原来他是在为失去了“家当”的剥削阶级分子说话。

    邓拓在《燕山夜话》里，借死人之口，杀气腾腾地写道：“十年磨一剑，霜刃未曾试；今日把示君，谁有不平事？”从这段黑话中，我们听到了阶级敌人咒骂的声音，磨刀的声音。事实上，邓拓已经在文化领域的阵地上，举着刀枪造起反来了，他甚至还想用木棒打击我们的头部，直到我们“休克”。对于阶级敌人的这种猖狂进攻，我们对付的办法是：敌人磨刀我磨刀，敌人进攻我们就要给予毁灭性的反击。
                  “硬骨头六连”连长　张全方
    邓拓到处宣扬“不骂人”，可是他自己呢？今天骂伟大的党是“带汁的诸葛亮”，明天骂大跃进是“吹牛皮”……这跟那些满口仁义道德，一肚子男盗女娼的地主分子有什么区别呢！看来，邓拓的言行是很不一致的，他要我们“不骂人”，实际上是要我们不要揭发他们这些牛鬼蛇神反党反社会主义的罪行。我们的回答是：对于阶级敌人，我们永远要“骂”，要揭发，要斗争，绝不会停止。
