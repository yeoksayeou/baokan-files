    Excerpts from Incoming Contributions
    "To shoot a man, first shoot his horse; to catch a thief, first catch the king," this principle is understood by many. Sacrificing a few pawns and deputy generals is nothing, as long as the marshal is not captured, the army can be reorganized and come back stronger. The editors of *Qianxian* and *Beijing Daily* proceeded from this point, making a great show of criticizing the "Three-Family Village" as a smokescreen, attempting to protect the "village head" Deng Tuo for a safe transfer and preserve strength. However, the revolutionary people also understand this point; they will never be satisfied with catching a few "thieves," but must capture its "king," and "round up in one fell swoop" the "Three-Family Village's" associates, shopkeepers, as well as its connivers, instigators, and protectors.
                Beijing No. 92 Middle School Teacher Ma Zongqi
    In his article "The Way of Kings and the Way of Hegemons," Deng Tuo viciously attacked our proletarian dictatorship as "the way of hegemons," cursing our Party for "relying on power and acting arbitrarily," "losing popular support." His sinister and vicious intentions are truly outrageous. Who is Deng Tuo referring to when he says "losing popular support"? It is obvious that he is referring to the hearts of that small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. If we want to win the hearts of this bunch of guys, then we will definitely not win the hearts of the vast majority of the people. Because landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are not of one heart with us. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are wholeheartedly seeking counter-revolutionary restoration, while the vast majority of our people are wholeheartedly following the Party and Chairman Mao to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. To gain a red heart, one cannot gain a black heart. The two are mutually exclusive and stand diametrically opposed.

    Deng Tuo said that the old society knew how to "cherish labor," implying that our socialism does not know how to cherish labor. He is talking nonsense to such an extent! My own personal experience is the most powerful proof. I went down the coal mine at the age of thirteen and have been working in the coal mine for more than twenty years. In the past, when I worked for the capitalists, I went down the pit at five o'clock in the morning and didn't come up until seven or eight o'clock in the evening, not seeing the sun all day long. After working like a beast of burden all day, the black-hearted capitalists would only give me a pound of black beans or a pound of sorghum. At that time, I wore burlap sacks above ground, and I still wore burlap sacks underground. If I got injured, got sick, or got old, I would be kicked away by the capitalists. This is the "care" for labor that I experienced in the old society! After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized labor protection, the combination of work and rest, and safe production. When we go down the pit, we wear work hats, work clothes, and work shoes. It can be said that the Party and the state take care of us from head to toe. The Party and the state have also established many welfare undertakings for us, such as schools, bathhouses, hospitals, clubs, and sanatoriums. This shows that the old society was a society that cruelly exploited the working people, and the socialist society is a society that truly cherishes the working people. Deng Tuo completely reversed black and white because he is a descendant of the exploiting class.

    “射人先射马，擒贼先擒王”，这个道理是许多人都懂得的，牺牲几个小卒和副将没有什么，只要元帅不被擒了去，就能重整军马，卷土重来。《前线》和《北京日报》编辑部正是从这一点出发，才大张旗鼓以批判“三家村”为名，放出烟幕，企图掩护“村长”邓拓安全转移，保存实力的。但是革命的人民同样懂得这一点，他们决不满足于擒几个“贼”，而且一定要擒住它的“王”，把“三家村”的伙计、掌柜以及它的纵容者、指使者、包庇者“一网打尽”。

    邓拓在《王道和霸道》一文里，恶毒地攻击我们无产阶级专政是什么“霸道”，咒骂我们党“依靠权势，蛮横逞强”、“不得人心”，其居心之阴险、毒辣，实在令人发指。邓拓所指的“不得人心”是指的不得什么人的心呢？显而易见，他指的是那一小撮地、富、反、坏、右的心。如果我们要得这帮家伙的心，那就肯定得不到绝大多数人民群众的心。因为地富反坏右和我们根本不是一条心。地富反坏右一心想搞反革命复辟，我们绝大多数人民则一心跟着党和毛主席，把社会主义革命进行到底。要得红心就不能得黑心。这两者是不能兼而得之的，是誓不两立的。
                    六八五八部队战士　李跃彬
    邓拓说旧社会就懂得“爱护劳动力”，言下之意是我们社会主义不懂得爱护劳动力。他胡说八道居然到了这种程度！我自己亲身的经历，就是一个最有力的证明。我十三岁就下煤窑，至今已在煤矿干了二十多年。过去，我给资本家下窑时，早上五点钟下坑，到晚上七、八点钟才上坑，一天两头不见太阳。象牛马一样受死累活的干上一天，黑心的资本家才给一斤黑豆或一斤高粱。那时候，在坑上是披麻袋片，下了坑还是披麻袋片，受了伤，生了病，上了年纪，就被资本家一脚踢开。这就是我体会到的旧社会对劳动力的“爱护”！解放后，党和毛主席一再强调劳动保护，劳逸结合，安全生产。我们一下坑，头戴工作帽，身穿工作衣，脚着工作鞋，可以说，党和国家从头到脚来爱护我们。党和国家还为我们办了学校、澡塘、医院、俱乐部和疗养院等许多福利事业。这说明，旧社会是残酷压榨劳动人民的社会，社会主义社会才是真正爱护劳动人民的社会。邓拓完全颠倒黑白，就因为他是剥削阶级的徒子徒孙。
