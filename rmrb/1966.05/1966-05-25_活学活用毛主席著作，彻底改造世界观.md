    Vigorously Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Writings, Thoroughly Transform Worldview
    Zhang Shixin, Deputy Political Commissar of a certain division of the PLA Chengdu Units
    Speaking of the time I have spent studying Chairman Mao's writings, it’s not short, relatively speaking. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I carried some of Chairman Mao's books in my small backpack. However, in the war years, I only studied them as work instructions and materials for learning to fight. After the publication of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," I treated it simply as theory. It was only in recent years that I truly used Chairman Mao's writings to transform my worldview.
    After the nationwide victory, I had some illusions about myself. I thought that I had participated in the revolution for many years, had been tempered by war and difficult environments, had been a model cadre, and had performed meritorious service. I had already made the determination to carry the revolution through to the end, and there was nothing wrong with my worldview, so I relaxed my ideological remolding. With the improvement of living standards and the rise in my position, my blindness also increased. I pursued enjoyment more, considered my status more, and my relationship with the masses was not as close as before. I realized that these were all problems, but what exactly was the root of the problems? I couldn't figure it out myself. I took this problem with me to study Chairman Mao's writings. Chairman Mao said: Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords riding on the backs of the people. He also said: All Communist Party members, all revolutionaries, must be the "oxen" of the proletariat and the masses. At this point, I realized that after becoming a leading cadre, the "official" air slowly grew stronger, and I no longer wanted to be an "ox." The problem lay here. Being an "official overlord" or being a "willing ox" is a question of worldview, the central content of ideological remolding, and the main contradiction that I must resolve. Recognizing this problem, the consciousness of transforming my ideology became higher, and my enthusiasm also increased. In actual practice, I grasped the word "bitterness" and, with the determination to carry the revolution through to the end, I recalled the past bitterness more, endured hardship more, and tempered my thinking. In my work, I went deeper and did more myself. In the company, I shared weal and woe with the soldiers and did not put on airs of an official. In my daily life, I maintained a style of hard work and simplicity and did not engage in special privileges. Starting from these specific problems, I transformed my thinking little by little.
    To be a servant of the people, one must be "diligent," one must personally do things, personally use one's brain, and actively take on the burdens of the revolution.
    In the past, when I worked in the regiment and as the director of the organization section in the army political department, I did many things myself. After becoming the deputy political commissar of the division, the situation changed: to understand the situation below, I could ask the cadres of the organization to investigate; to issue a document, I could ask the cadres of the organization to draft it; to make a report, I could ask the cadres of the organization to write the speech. There were more opportunities to manage others, and fewer opportunities to be managed by others. The amount of work done could be increased or decreased, and the flexibility was great, in any case, the superiors would not assign tasks to me every day. This new situation presented me with a new problem: should I maintain the good working style of the past, or should I put on the airs of a leader? Should I do it myself, or should I eat ready-made meals? Should I regard the position of deputy political commissar as a burden to carry, or as an official position to hold?
    Once, when I gave a current affairs report to the instructor training team, the propaganda section prepared a draft for me. I read the draft and did not grasp the living ideas. In addition, my accent was difficult to understand, so everyone didn't find it interesting. Some comrades were dozing off, and I also had a hard time speaking. After finishing the lecture, I thought, why wasn't this class good? Mainly because I suffered from the word "lazy." Chairman Mao taught: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." A servant must be "diligent," must personally do things, and actively take on the burdens of the revolution, otherwise one will become an "official overlord." The more there are conditions to be lazy, the less one can be lazy. The more one can avoid hardship, the more one must endure hardship. To write something, one must collect materials everywhere, and one must use one's brain. If I wanted to be lazy, I could just find an excuse and push it away. But there are many benefits to writing oneself. To make a report, asking someone else to write the speech is certainly the easiest. But reading someone else's draft, being confined by others, is giving up leadership. To fulfill the responsibilities of leadership, one must have one's own views. One must do it oneself. No matter what work one does, without a spirit of hard work and practical work, it will not be done well. Doing a little more or a little less, it seems like the problem is not big, but whether it is diligence or laziness reflects whether one is energetic or old-fashioned, whether one is making a difference or doing nothing. If "laziness" is the priority, there is no revolutionary spirit, and it can only bring losses to the revolutionary cause.
    Over the past few years, I have insisted on doing things myself. I personally drafted some important documents, personally went to the company to investigate and study, and prepared my own speeches and summaries for meetings, trying not to let the organization cadres "serve" me. Last year, I was engaged in socialist education in a certain regiment's organization, and the regiment wanted me to make a summary. At that time, time was very tight, there were a lot of specific problems, and a lot of living ideas. How to bring them together? How to improve them? It really required some thought. Originally, it could have been done by other cadres in the work team. But I thought again, this is an important task, I should do it myself. So, while flipping through my notes, I studied Chairman Mao's writings, and it took me a whole day and night to organize the material. In the summary, I also related my own personal feelings about transforming my thinking, and it was more practical and natural. Such a summary, if someone else was asked to write the speech, it would be impossible to write my own actual feelings into it.
    Last year, some comrades in the division organization reflected that the cadres in the troops were not studying Chairman Mao's writings as well as the soldiers. What exactly was the situation? What was the reason? They also lacked investigation and couldn't say specifically. I took this problem and went to the troops, went to two regiments one after another, personally participated in the cadres' study, talked with the cadres, and checked the study notes of more than thirty cadres. After such an investigation, I had a better understanding of the situation. The main problem with the cadres' study was in the word "use," and the most critical thing was that they didn't dare to reveal their thoughts. The cadres who didn't dare to boldly reveal their thoughts mainly had two ideological obstacles: they were afraid of losing trust with their superiors, and they were afraid of losing prestige with their subordinates. I thought that it wouldn't work to just talk about principles to solve this problem, there had to be a living example. After further investigation, I found that He Fengyou, the deputy battalion commander of the first battalion of the artillery regiment, had solved this problem well. In the past, he was arrogant and complacent. After studying Chairman Mao's writings, he checked and examined this problem every day. In the past, he didn't admit that he was arrogant, but now he can openly examine his thinking in front of the battalion and company cadres. Everyone up and down said that he had changed for the better. I seized this typical example and promoted it in the two regiments. The cadres were afraid that the leaders would not trust them if they revealed their thoughts, so I said everywhere that He Fengyou's ability to reveal his thoughts was a good thing in self-revolution, the more he could reveal his thoughts, the more he would be able to transform himself, and the more the leaders would trust him. The cadres were afraid that revealing their thoughts would affect their prestige with their subordinates, so I revealed my thoughts everywhere and also introduced some of my own experiences. Later, at the plenary session of the division party committee, I made a special speech on studying Chairman Mao's writings, emphasizing that whether or not one dares to reveal one's thoughts is a question of party spirit, a question of attitude, not a question of method; I asked the party committees and leaders of each regiment to take the lead in revealing their thoughts in guiding the troops' cadres in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and to create conditions for the cadres to boldly reveal their thoughts. If I hadn't investigated myself, I wouldn't have been able to grasp this problem. One cannot parrot others about anything, to uncover the essence of things and obtain the real right to speak and the right to lead, one must take action and use one's brain to put in some effort in practice. Lazy people will never master the dialectical materialist method of leadership, nor will they have real leadership.
    Over the past few years, I have been to almost all the companies in the entire division, and I have also stayed at nine companies. Going to the companies often is indeed harder than being in the organization. But since the party has entrusted this burden to me, I must use all my strength to carry it. Without personally going deep into the companies, how can I grasp first-hand materials, how can I guide the work! If I can't endure this hardship of going to the companies, how can I exchange it for the joy of doing a good job! The year before last, the overall evaluation of the "Four Goods" was launched simultaneously in the entire division. I thought that sitting in the organization and directing, without personally participating in practice, it would be easy to talk empty words. So, I took the work team and the telephone to stay at the fourth company of a certain regiment, participating in the overall evaluation of the fourth company while guiding the overall evaluation work of other companies. In this way, the questions raised were more practical, and the words could also be said to the point. From these things, I realized that whether or not one can do things oneself is a question of being responsible to the revolution, a question of implementing specific leadership or engaging in "abstract leadership," not just a question of working style. With this understanding, I was more conscious of doing things myself and going deep into the companies.
    Through staying at companies, by frequently contacting soldiers, one can establish proletarian feelings; if one has deep class feelings for the soldiers, one has deep feelings for the party's cause.
    Over the past few years, when I have stayed at the companies, I have often encountered many preferential treatments from the company cadres, and they have also put forward many "reasons," such as old age, poor health, old leader, a whole bunch. They would add a dish to the meal, or cook a pot of noodles, or find a good room and a good bed to sleep in, in short, they wanted to make me different from the company cadres and soldiers. Chairman Mao once told us: "Among our many working personnel, there is now a dangerous tendency of unwillingness to share weal and woe with the masses, and a fondness for calculating personal fame and gain, which is very bad." If I accept the preferential treatment they give me, it means that I admit that I am superior to the soldiers. Eating one more dish encroaches on the soldiers' share of benefits. Being a little more special than the soldiers, in terms of ideology and feelings, I am further away from the soldiers. Last spring, I went to the first company of a certain regiment to stay, and at that time, the first company had just moved to a new place to engage in production, and there was no housing. After I went, the cadres wanted me to live in the camp's houses, although the camp was only a few hundred meters away from the company, I still refused, and lived in tents like the soldiers. It rained at night, the tent leaked, and I got up to move the bed like the soldiers. For meals, I squatted in the field with the soldiers. Those few days were the season for transplanting rice seedlings, and the soldiers were soaking in the paddy fields all day long. I had neurodermatitis on my legs, which itched at night, and I scratched them until they were bloody. Should I go down to the fields? In the past, I was quite familiar with growing rice, but I hadn't done it for many years, and my hands were a little itchy. The cadres of this company were also from the north and didn't know much about transplanting rice seedlings, and the labor organization was also a mess. I came here to stay, discovered the problem, but just walked around the field, pointing and gesturing, wouldn't I become a "field gentleman"? Chairman Mao said: Cadres participating in collective productive labor and maintaining the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the working people is a fundamental issue under the socialist system. It helps to overcome bureaucratism and prevent revisionism and dogmatism. Recalling Chairman Mao's teachings, I rolled up my trousers, took off my shoes and went down to the fields, and while working with the soldiers, I told them stories about the New Fourth Army engaging in production in northern Jiangsu. Soon I became familiar with the soldiers, and they were willing to tell me anything. In our joint labor, our thoughts and feelings merged together, and I also learned many of the soldiers' excellent qualities.
    Through staying at companies, my class feelings for the soldiers became deeper. As Chairman Mao taught us, by being with the workers, peasants, and revolutionary soldiers, one gradually becomes familiar with them, and they gradually become familiar with oneself. Only at this time can one fundamentally change one's bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feelings and establish proletarian feelings. Without contacting the soldiers, without eating from the same pot, sleeping in the same room, working together, and studying together, without understanding what they are thinking and what they are asking for, it is impossible to establish true proletarian feelings. As a leading cadre, with a higher position and a greater distance from the soldiers, it is even more necessary to frequently contact the soldiers and frequently awaken one's class feelings.
    Chairman Mao said: "The more you put on your airs in front of the masses, the more you act like a 'hero,' the more you try to sell this set, the less the masses will buy it. If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to become one with the masses, you have to make up your mind and go through long and even painful trials." I think, for us leading cadres in the army, to serve the people wholeheartedly means to serve the soldiers wholeheartedly most directly. Deep class feelings for the soldiers means deep feelings for the party's cause; being responsible for the growth of the soldiers means being responsible for the party's cause.
    To maintain the true qualities of an ordinary soldier, one must endure hardship, use hardship to prevent laziness, use hardship to prevent preciousness, use hardship to prevent extravagance, and use hardship to prevent revisionism.
    A few years ago, we were carrying out tasks on the plateau. Once, during a march, I suffered a great deal, which can be said to be a great test of will and physical strength. Suffering this hardship was good, and made my thinking clearer. That day, we had to cross a mountain with an altitude of more than 5,000 meters. At the beginning, my enthusiasm was great, but the more I climbed, the more tired I became. There was no road on the mountain, only jungles, rocks, and cliffs. After climbing for several hours, I still couldn't see the top of the mountain. I was hungry, my eyes were blurred, and my arthritis also flared up. In the end, I could only move forward one step at a time with both my hands and feet. In this way, it took me a full thirteen hours to reach the top of the mountain. As soon as I reached the top of the mountain, I couldn't even stand up. After climbing this mountain, the comrades said that my body was still okay. I thought: my ability to insist on climbing to the top of the mountain shows that my usual exercise has achieved certain results; but climbing so exhausted also shows that my usual exercise is not enough, especially for climbing such a big mountain, my mental preparation is very insufficient. Whether or not I have such mental preparation at ordinary times, whether or not I think about the future from the most difficult, most arduous, and most difficult conditions, is a question of attitude towards the revolutionary cause. I am a soldier, and I must be ready to fight at any time. At ordinary times, I train myself from difficult situations, and when war breaks out, I can cope with various arduous and complex situations.
    Thirteen hours of climbing was very educational for me. I often ask myself, with my body like this, if a war breaks out, can I endure it, can I complete the tasks assigned by the party? Chairman Mao said that nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds on it. We should think more about the difficulties of future wars and prepare more fully. As long as I usually prevent preciousness, can get off my horse and walk at night, and grind my feet with more calluses, I will still be able to withstand the test at that time. In the past few years, I have never ridden a horse when I have camped with the troops. In the winter of 1964, when the troops' camping changed from stationed training to field training, our division organization walked continuously for two days and two nights. I climbed the mountain with everyone. The mountain weather was cold. I didn't wear socks, and the cold wind blew, and my feet cracked. The comrades advised me to ride a horse. I thought, I can't ride. My usual exercise is not only to exercise my marching ability, but more importantly to exercise my revolutionary will. Riding a few steps on a horse doesn't have much impact on physical strength, but once I ride on it. My will becomes soft, which is equivalent to admitting that I don't want to walk anymore and can't persevere. Willpower and physical strength are equally important. In wartime, with a tenacious revolutionary will, I can better complete the task.
    Climbing big mountains and touching night roads with the soldiers during camping is an exercise. But relying on this alone is not enough. The important thing is to always think about fighting in my heart, always be prepared to endure great hardship and endure great labor, and constantly exercise myself. Participate in more physical labor, carry manure, dig the ground, mop the floor, wash clothes, don't take the car if you can, and exercise more by walking.
    Exercise is multifaceted, in addition to exercising physical strength, it is also necessary to exercise the ability to live a hard life. To live a hard life, one must first have the idea of enduring hardship. Whether or not one can endure hardship is a big question of whether or not one is revolutionary. People who often endure hardship are not afraid of hardship, and people who can endure hardship can be revolutionary. Now that life is better, we must be vigilant in times of peace, and not be happy in times of peace. Over the past few years, our family life has always tried to maintain a low level. Some comrades joked that I was a "stingy ghost" and a "miser." I think this way: it's easy to live a rich life, but it's more difficult to live a hard life. The life of a Communist Party member cannot be too far away from the life of the masses, and one should look downward and not forget the poor and lower-middle peasants. Always maintaining the style of hard work and struggle is not only a good quality that Communist Party members must have, but also a fundamental measure for preventing revisionism and opposing revisionism. With this, we can always maintain revolutionary vigor, and we can continuously make revolution and carry the revolution through to the end. At the same time, we are troops, and we must be ready to fight at any time. Living in the city, we must think about living in the mountains in the future; living in tile houses, we must think about living in grass sheds in the future; sleeping on wooden beds, we must think about sleeping on straw mats in the future; eating rice and white flour, we must think about eating wild vegetables in the future. If the body is spoiled, it will not be able to endure hardship at that time. Therefore, being more frugal in life at ordinary times is also an important preparation for war. Chairman Mao said: "Adapt our thinking and work to the situation, prepare to sit down, and prepare to walk, and don't lose our dry food bags." Think about wartime at ordinary times, train our will more, exercise our bodies more, endure more hardship, and we will not forget our dry food bags. At that time, we can carry our dry food bags, leave when we are told, and fight when we are told.
    In the process of self-transformation in recent years, I have deeply realized that the worldview is reflected through specific problems, and the transformation of the worldview should start with the transformation of specific problems. Looking down on those "small things" and "small problems" makes the transformation empty talk. Transforming the worldview especially requires being able to endure hardship and being tough on the word "hardship." Taking Chairman Mao's writings as a weapon, using hardship to prevent laziness, using hardship to prevent preciousness, using hardship to prevent extravagance, in a word, using hardship to prevent revisionism. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie have fundamentally opposed views on hardship and happiness. The bourgeoisie is most afraid of hardship. The proletariat has the courage to deal with "hardship," and we have our own view of hardship and happiness. The victory of the communist cause is itself a long and arduous struggle process. Consciously enduring hardship with great ideals, and enduring hardship for the liberation of the people of the world, is the greatest joy and the highest enjoyment of revolutionaries. Only by always maintaining and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and struggle can we forever maintain revolutionary youth.
    My study of Chairman Mao's writings and my efforts on the word "use" are far from enough. I am determined to continue to study hard, continue to transform myself, improve my work, and work hard and do practical work for the communist cause for the rest of my life.

    活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改造世界观
    解放军成都部队某师副政委　张示心
    我学习毛主席著作的时间，按说不算短了。抗日战争时期，我的小背包里就背着毛主席的一些书。但是，在战争年代，我只是把它当成工作指示和学习打仗的教材来学，《毛泽东选集》出版以后，我又把它单纯当成理论来学。真正用毛主席著作来改造自己的世界观，还是近几年的事。
    全国胜利以后，我对自己曾经产生过一些错觉。认为自己参加革命多年，经过战争和艰苦环境的锻炼，当过模范干部，立过功，革命到底的决心早就下了，世界观没有什么问题了，所以就放松了自己的思想改造。随着生活的提高，职务的上升，我的盲目性也增长了。追求享受多了，考虑地位多了，同群众的关系也不象以前那样亲密了。我觉察到这些都是问题，但问题的根子究竟是什么？自己搞不大清楚。我带着这个问题去学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。又说：一切共产党员，一切革命家，都要做无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”。这时我才明白，原来我当了领导干部以后，“官”气慢慢的大起来了，不再想做“牛”了，问题就出在这里。当“官老爷”，还是做“孺子牛”，这是个世界观的问题，是改造思想的中心内容，是自己必需解决的主要矛盾。认识了这个问题，改造思想的自觉性就高了，干劲也大了。在实际行动中，我就抓住“苦”字不放，带着革命到底的决心，多忆苦，多吃苦，磨练自己的思想；在工作中多深入，多动手；在连队中，同战士同甘共苦，不摆官架子；在日常生活中，保持艰苦朴素的作风，不搞特殊化。从这些具体问题上做起，一点一滴地去改造自己的思想。
    做人民的勤务员，就是要“勤”，就是要亲自动手，亲自动脑，主动地挑起革命的担子
    过去，我在团里工作和在军政治部当组织处长的时候，许多工作都是自己动手。担任师副政委以后，情况变了：要了解下情，可以叫机关的干部去调查；要发个文件，可以叫机关的干部去起草；要作个报告，可以叫机关的干部写讲话稿。管别人的机会多了，受别人管的机会少了。工作做多做少，伸缩性大，反正上级不会给我天天布置任务。这种新情况，给我提出了新问题：是保持过去好的工作作风，还是要拉个首长的架子？是自己动手，还是吃现成饭？是把副政委当成担子挑，还是当成官来做？
    有一次，我给指导员集训队作时事报告，宣传科给我准备了讲稿。我拿着稿子念，没有抓住活思想，加上我的口音不好懂，大家听得没味道，有的同志打瞌睡，我讲得也很吃力。讲完以后，我想，为什么这堂课没有讲好？主要是吃了“懒”字的苦头。毛主席教导说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。勤务员就是要“勤”，就是要亲自动手，主动地挑起革命的担子，不然就成为“官老爷”了。越是有偷懒的条件，越不能偷懒，越是可以不吃苦，越要吃苦。写个东西，就要到处收集材料，要动脑子。我要想偷懒，随便找个借口，就推出去了。但是自己动手写，有很多好处。要作个报告，叫别人写讲稿，当然最省事。但是念人家的稿子，叫人家框住，就是放弃了领导权。要尽到领导的责任，要有自己的一些见解。就得亲自动手。不管做什么工作，没有苦干、实干精神，是做不好的。有些事多干一点少干一点，看起来问题不大，但是，是勤是懒，反映了是朝气勃勃还是老气横秋，是有所作为还是无所作为。“懒”字当头，就没有革命精神，只能给革命事业带来损失。
    几年来，我坚持了亲自动手。一些重要的文件我亲自动笔起草，亲自下连队调查研究，开会作报告、作总结，都是自己动手准备，尽量不要机关干部为我“服务”。去年我在某团机关搞社会主义教育，团里要我作总结，当时时间很紧，一大堆具体问题，一大堆活思想，怎样捏拢？怎样提高？确实要用一番脑子。本来让工作组的其他干部搞一搞也可以。又一想，这是个重要工作，还是自己来。于是，我一边翻笔记，一边学毛主席著作，整整搞了一天一夜，才把材料整好。在总结中，我又联系自己改造思想的切身感受，讲得比较实在，比较自然。这样的总结，要是叫别人写讲稿，是无法把自己的实际感受写上去的。
    去年，师机关有的同志反映，部队干部学习毛主席著作不如战士。究竟怎么样？是什么原因？他们也缺乏调查，说不具体。我带着这个问题下到部队，先后到了两个团，亲自参加干部的学习，找干部交谈，并检查了三十几个干部的学习心得笔记。经过这样一番调查，我的心里有了谱。部队干部的学习，主要是差在“用”字上，其中最关键的又是不敢亮思想。不敢大胆亮思想的干部，主要有两个思想障碍：对上怕失去信任，对下怕失去威信。我想，解决这个问题光讲道理不行，要有活的样板。经过进一步调查，发现炮团一营副营长何风友对这个问题解决得好。以前，他骄傲自满。学了毛主席著作以后，就天天对照、检查这个毛病。过去，他不承认自己骄傲，现在能在营连干部面前公开检查自己的思想。上上下下都说他改得好。我抓住这个典型，就在两个团作了宣传。干部怕亮了思想领导不信任，我就到处说何风友能亮思想是自我革命精神好，越能亮思想，越能勇于改造，领导对他越信任。干部怕亮了思想影响下级对自己的威信，我就到处亮我的思想，还介绍了自己的一些体会。以后，我在师党委全体会上，专门作了学习毛主席著作的发言，强调了敢不敢亮，是个党性问题，态度问题，不是个方法问题；要求各团党委和领导在指导部队干部学习毛主席著作中，要带头亮思想，创造条件让干部大胆亮思想。要不是亲自调查，我就抓不住这个问题。对任何事物不能人云亦云，要想揭开事物的本质，取得真正的发言权、领导权，就得迈开两腿，开动脑子，到实际中去下一番功夫。懒汉是永远不会掌握辩证唯物主义的领导方法的，也不会有真正领导权的。
    几年来，全师的连队我差不多都去过，还在九个连队蹲过点。经常下连队，的确比在机关苦一些。可是，既然党把这副担子交给我，我就得拿出全身力量来挑。不亲自深入连队，怎么掌握第一手材料，怎么指导工作！吃不了下连队这点苦，怎么能换来搞好工作的乐！前年四好总评，全师部队一齐展开。我想，坐在机关指挥，不亲自参加实践，容易说空话。于是，我带上工作组，带上电话机，到某团四连蹲点，边参加四连的总评，边指导其它连队的总评工作。这样一来，提的问题比较实在了，话也能说到点子上了。从这些事情里我体会到，能不能亲自动手，是对革命负责不负责的问题，是实行具体领导，还是搞“抽象领导”的问题，不只是个工作作风问题。有了这个认识，我在亲自动手，深入连队上就更自觉一些了。
    通过蹲点，经常接触战士，才能建立起无产阶级的感情；对战士的阶级感情深，就是对党的事业感情深
    几年来，我到连队蹲点，常常遇到连队干部给我的许多优待，他们还提出许多“理由”，什么年纪大啦，身体不好啦，老首长啦，一大堆。吃饭要加一个菜，或者煮一盆面条，睡觉要给找个好屋好铺，总之，要让我和连队干部、战士不一样。毛主席曾经告诉我们：“在我们的许多工作人员中间，现在滋长着一种不愿意和群众同甘苦，喜欢计较个人名利的危险倾向，这是很不好的。”如果接受他们给我的优待，就意味着我承认自己比战士高一等；多吃一个菜，就侵占战士一分利益；比战士特殊一点，在思想感情上就和战士远一点。去年春天，我到某团一连蹲点，那时一连刚搬到新地方搞生产，连住房都没有。我去了以后，干部要我住到营部的房子里，虽然营部离连队只有几百米，但我还是拒绝了，同战士们一样，都住在帐篷里。晚上下雨，帐篷漏水，我和战士们一样，起来搬床铺。吃饭，和战士们一起蹲在野地里吃。那几天正是插秧季节，战士们成天泡在水田里。我腿上有神经性皮炎，晚上发痒，扣得血糊糊的。下不下田呢？过去，我对种水稻是比较熟悉的，多少年没有搞了，手有些发痒。这个连的干部又是北方人，不大懂插秧的活路，劳动组织也比较乱。我来这里蹲点，发现了问题，只是在田边转，指手划脚，不成了“田间相公”了吗？毛主席说：干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。想起毛主席的教导，我便挽起裤腿，脱鞋下田，和战士们一边劳动，一边向他们讲新四军在苏北搞生产的故事。很快就和战士们混熟了，他们有什么话都愿对我讲。在共同劳动中，我们的思想感情融汇在一起了，我也学习了许多战士的优秀品质。
    通过蹲点，我对战士的阶级感情更深了。正如毛主席教导我们的，同工人、农民和革命战士在一起，自己逐渐熟悉了他们，他们也逐渐熟悉了自己，只是在这时，才能根本地改变自己资产阶级和小资产阶级的感情，建立起无产阶级的感情。不接触战士，不和他们同吃一锅饭，同睡一间房，一起劳动，一起学习，不了解他们想些什么，要求什么，是不可能建立起真正的无产阶级感情的。当了领导干部，职位高了，距离战士远了，更需要经常接触战士，经常唤起自己的阶级感情。
    毛主席说：“在群众面前把你的资格摆得越老，越象个‘英雄’，越要出卖这一套，群众就越不买你的账。你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”我想，对我们这些部队领导干部来说，全心全意为人民服务，最直接的就是全心全意为兵服务。对战士的阶级感情深，就是对党的事业感情深；对战士的成长负责，就是对党的事业负责。
    要保持普通一兵的本色，就要吃得苦，以苦防懒，以苦防娇，以苦防奢，以苦防修
    几年前，我们在高原执行任务。有一次行军我吃了个大苦头，可以说是一次意志和体力的大考验。这次苦吃得好，使我的思想更亮堂了。那天，我们要翻过一座海拔五千多米的高山。开始，我的劲头挺大，可是越爬越累。山上没有路，尽是丛林、乱石和峭壁，爬了好几个小时，还是不见山顶。肚子饿了，眼睛花了，关节炎也发了，到最后，简直是手脚一齐使劲才能前进一步。就这样，我整整爬了十三个小时才到了山顶。一到山顶，我站也站不起来了。爬了这次山，同志们说我的身体还行。我想：我能坚持爬上山顶，说明我平时的锻炼有了一定成绩；但是爬得这样精疲力尽，又说明我平时锻炼得还不够，特别是对爬这样大的山，精神准备是很不够的。平时有没有这样的思想准备，是不是从最困难、最艰苦、最恶劣的条件去想未来，这是个对待革命事业的态度问题。我是当兵的，要随时准备打仗。平时从困难的情况出发去锻炼自己，打起仗来，才能应付各种艰苦复杂的情况。
    十三个小时的爬山，对我的教育很深。我常常问自己，凭我这样的身体，打起仗来，能不能吃得住，能不能完成党交给的任务？毛主席说，天下无难事，只怕有心人。要把将来战争的困难想得多一些，准备得足一些。只要自己平时防止娇气，能下了马走夜路，把脚板多磨几层茧子，到时候还是能经得起摔打的。这几年我跟部队野营，从来没骑过马。一九六四年冬天，部队野营由驻练转为拉练，我们师机关连续走了两天两夜。我和大家一起爬山。山区天气冷。我没有穿袜子，冷风一吹，脚上就裂了口子。同志们劝我骑马。我想，不能骑。我平时的锻炼不只是锻炼行军能力，更重要的是锻炼我的革命意志。骑上几步马，对体力的锻炼倒没有多大影响，可是这一骑上去。意志就软了，就等于承认我不想走了，坚持不下来了。意志和体力同样重要。到了战时，有顽强的革命意志，就可以更好地完成任务。
    野营时同战士们一起爬大山，摸夜路，这是个锻炼。但是光靠这个是很不够的。重要的是要心里时刻想到打仗，时刻准备吃大苦，耐大劳，经常地锻炼自己。多参加体力劳动，挑挑粪，挖挖地，拖拖地板，洗洗衣服，能不坐汽车就不坐汽车，多锻炼走路。
    锻炼是多方面的，除了锻炼体力，还要锻炼过苦日子。过苦日子，先得有吃苦的思想。吃不吃得苦，是个革不革命的大问题。常吃苦就不怕苦，能吃苦就能革命。现在生活好了，要居安思危，不能居安思乐。几年来，我们家庭生活一直尽量保持低水平。有的同志开玩笑，说我是“小气鬼”、“守财奴”。我这样想：过富日子容易，过苦日子就比较难。一个共产党员的生活，不能离群众的生活太远了，应该眼睛向下，不要忘了贫下中农。始终保持艰苦奋斗的作风，不仅是共产党员必须具有的好品德，而且是防修、反修的根本措施。有了这一条，就能永远保持革命朝气，就能不断革命，革命到底。同时，我们是部队，要随时准备打仗，住在城市要想到将来住山上；住在瓦房要想到将来住草棚，睡板床要想到将来睡草铺；吃大米白面要想到将来吃野菜。身体娇了，到了那时候就吃不了苦了。所以，平时生活上艰苦一些，也是个重要的战备。毛主席说过：“把我们的思想、工作适应于情况，准备坐下，又准备走路，不要把干粮袋丢掉了。”平时想战时，多磨炼意志，多锻炼身体，多吃苦，就忘不了干粮袋，到时候就能背起干粮袋，说走就走，说打就打。
    在近几年自我改造的过程中，我深深体会到：世界观是通过具体问题反映出来的，改造世界观要从具体问题改造起。看不起那些“小事情”、“小问题”，改造就成了一句空话。改造世界观尤其需要吃得苦，在“苦”字上过得硬。把毛主席著作做武器，以苦防懒，以苦防娇，以苦防奢，一句话就是以苦防修。对于苦和乐，无产阶级和资产阶级有根本对立的看法。资产阶级最怕苦。无产阶级有勇气跟“苦”打交道，我们有我们的苦乐观。共产主义事业的胜利，本身就是一个长期的、艰苦的斗争过程。怀着伟大的理想自觉地去吃苦，为解放全世界人民而吃苦，这是最大的乐事，是革命者的最高的享受。永远保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，才能永葆革命的青春。
    我学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫还很不够。我决心继续努力学习，继续改造自己，改进工作，为共产主义事业实干苦干一辈子。
