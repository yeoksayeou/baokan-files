    Excerpts from Incoming Submissions

    When anti-Party elements attack the Party, they either attack indirectly, fabricate stories, revive the dead, or smuggle goods under false pretenses... their tricks are numerous and their schemes are ever-changing. In the beginning, they always think they are succeeding, arrogant and conceited; later, when they see the situation is not good, they have no choice but to "take the thirty-six strategies, running is the best strategy," trying to slip away, or hide; in the end, their conspiracy is exposed and they are completely finished. All anti-Party and anti-socialist elements follow this path, and today's Deng Tuo and Wu Han are also following this path.
                    Employee of Beijing Sport University, Zou Meitang
    Deng Tuo curses our Party as "Zhuge Liang with juice." We must ask: Who predicted "a single spark can start a prairie fire" when the Great Revolution was at a low ebb? Who predicted, during the most difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, that the Chinese people's revolutionary war would surely achieve victory, and that "the mast of the ship of New China has already emerged from the horizon"? ... Countless historical facts prove that the Chinese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, is ten thousand times smarter than Zhuge Liang. Anti-Party elements like Deng Tuo, pretending to be "Zhuge Liang," thinking they are clever, cursing others as "Zhuge Liang with juice," today their true colors are exposed, and they are ridiculed by the people of the world. This is the inevitable end of people like Deng Tuo.
                  Worker of the Comprehensive Team of the Ministry of Forestry, Li Yongdong
    A small handful of people like Deng Tuo attack our Party for "looking down on the masses." The "masses" they refer to are completely different from the masses we refer to. The masses we believe in and rely on are more than 95% of the working people, while the "masses" they refer to are a small handful of class enemies such as landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Of course, we "look down" on these people, because we are irreconcilable with them. If we look up to them, if we trust them, and rely on them, wouldn't our Party become the Kuomintang, become the Fascist Party?
  Active Participant in Studying Chairman Mao's Works, Unit 4798 of Hebei, Ma Sanqun
    Deng Tuo nonsensically says that "the army does not engage in contention." This can also be considered "correct," that is: the People's Liberation Army, as an instrument of the proletarian dictatorship, only listens to the Party and Chairman Mao, and only acts according to the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao. How can it allow anti-Party and anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo to "contend"? Listen up, anti-Party and anti-socialist elements of the "Three-Family Village," there is no profit for you to gain in the People's Liberation Army personally created and led by Chairman Mao!

    反党分子攻击党，或指桑骂槐，或无中生有，或借尸还魂，或暗渡陈仓……鬼计多端，花样百出。开头它们总是自以为得计，目中无人，狂妄极了；后来一看形势不妙，只好“三十六计，走为上计”，企图溜之大吉，或者躲藏起来；最后则是阴谋败露，彻底完蛋。一切反党反社会主义分子走的是这条路，今天的邓拓、吴晗之流，同样走的是这条路。
                    北京体育学院职工　邹美唐
    邓拓咒骂我们党是“带汁的诸葛亮”。我们要问：是谁在大革命处于低潮时期预言“星星之火，可以燎原”呢？是谁在抗日战争最艰苦的时期，就预言中国人民的革命战争一定可以取得胜利，“新中国航船的桅顶已经冒出地平线了”呢？……无数历史事实证明，用马列主义理论武装起来的中国共产党比诸葛亮高明万倍。邓拓之流的反党分子，装出一副“诸葛亮”的样子，自以为高明，咒骂别人“是带汁的诸葛亮”，今天自己原形毕露了，被天下人所耻笑。这就是邓拓之流的必然下场。
                  林业部综合队工人　李永东
    邓拓等一小撮人攻击我们党“看不起群众”，他们所指的“群众”，与我们所说的群众完全是两码事。我们相信并依靠的群众，是百分之九十五以上的劳动人民，而他们所指的“群众”，却是一小撮地富反坏右等阶级敌人。对于这些人，我们当然“看不起”，因为我们跟他们是水火不相容的，如果看得起他们，如果信任他们，依靠他们，我们的党不就变成国民党，变成法西斯党了么？
  河北四七九八部队学习毛主席著作积极分子　马三群
    邓拓胡说什么“军队不搞争鸣”，这一点也可以算是说“对”了，这就是：作为无产阶级专政工具的人民军队，只听党和毛主席的话，只按党和毛主席的指示办事，哪能容许邓拓之类的反党反社会主义分子“争鸣”呢？“三家村”的反党反社会主义分子们听着，在毛主席亲手缔造和领导的人民军队里，没有你们可捞的油水！
