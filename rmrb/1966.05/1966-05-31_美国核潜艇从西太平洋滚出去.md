    U.S. Nuclear Submarines Get Out of the Western Pacific
    By Renmin Ribao Commentator

    U.S. nuclear submarines blatantly entered the Japanese port of Yokosuka on the 30th of this month. This is yet another humiliation by U.S. imperialism against Japan's independence and sovereignty, and another naked provocation against the people of Asia.

    In the span of a little over a year, U.S. nuclear submarines have entered Japanese ports nine times. In the past eight times, U.S. nuclear submarines have docked at the port of Sasebo in southern Japan, but this time they have gone even further, penetrating the port of Yokosuka in central Japan. This action is taking place at a time when U.S. imperialism is expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam. It is also part of U.S. imperialism's sinister plot to strategically encircle China with nuclear weapons. It is clear to people that U.S. imperialism has not only made Japan its base for conducting conventional warfare in Asia, but is also systematically making Japan an important base for launching a nuclear war.

    The Japanese Sato government openly allows U.S. nuclear submarines to enter Japanese ports, and shamelessly claims that this is being done "in accordance with the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." It even claims that the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam is "related to Japan's security." This is a completely ugly face of being willing to serve as an accomplice to U.S. imperialist aggression. This fact also fully demonstrates that the Sato government insists on following U.S. imperialism and is determined to be an enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the Asian people to the end. However, any sensible Japanese person will understand that Japan becoming a nuclear war base for U.S. imperialism can only mean that the Japanese nation will be dragged into the abyss of disaster once again. Where is the "security" to be found there? The pro-U.S. imperialist Sato government is leading Japan down an extremely dangerous path.

    The continuous entry of U.S. nuclear submarines into Japanese ports cannot but arouse strong opposition from the Japanese people. A massive mass struggle has already begun. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries believe that U.S. imperialism's nuclear submarines are formidable and can flaunt their power in Asia and the Pacific. However, a mere few nuclear submarines cannot intimidate the Japanese people and the revolutionary people of Asia. What is truly powerful is not any new weapon of U.S. imperialism, but the awakened and courageous people of all countries. The Japanese people and the Asian people will surely drive U.S. imperialism, along with its nuclear submarines, out of Japan and the entire Asia, out of the Sea of Japan and the entire Western Pacific!

    美国核潜艇从西太平洋滚出去
    本报评论员
    美国核潜艇于本月三十日明目张胆地开进日本港口横须贺。这是美帝国主义对日本独立和主权的又一次凌辱，是对亚洲人民的又一次赤裸裸的挑衅。
    在一年多的时间内，美国核潜艇已经九次开进日本港口。过去八次，美国核潜艇都在日本南部的佐世保港口停泊，而这一次竟然更进一步深入到日本中部的横须贺港口。这一行动，正处于美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的时候。这也是美帝国主义对中国进行战略核包围罪恶阴谋的一部分。人们看得很清楚，美帝国主义不仅已经把日本作为它在亚洲进行常规战争的基地，而且正在有计划地把日本当作它发动核战争的一个重要基地。
    日本佐藤政府公然允许美国核潜艇进入日本港口，而且还无耻地说什么这是“根据日美安全保障条约行事的”。它竟然宣称，美国对越南的侵略战争，也是“同日本的安全有关”。这完全是一副甘心充当美帝国主义侵略帮凶的丑恶面目。这个事实也充分表明，佐藤政府坚持追随美帝国主义，决心与越南人民、中国人民和亚洲人民为敌到底。但是，任何神志清醒的日本人士都会懂得，日本成为美帝国主义的核战争基地，只能意味着日本民族将再次被拖入灾难的深渊，那里有什么“安全”可言呢？亲美帝国主义的佐藤政府正在把日本引向极端危险的道路。
    美国核潜艇不断地开进日本港口，不能不激起日本人民的强烈反对。一个声势浩大的群众斗争已经展开。美日反动派以为，美帝国主义的核潜艇十分了不起，可以在亚洲和太平洋张牙舞爪，耀武扬威。但是，区区几艘核潜艇是吓不倒日本人民和亚洲革命人民的。真正强大的不是美帝国主义的任何新式武器，而是觉醒起来、敢于斗争的各国人民。日本人民和亚洲人民定将把美帝国主义连同它的核潜艇，从日本和整个亚洲，从日本海和整个西太平洋统统赶出去！
