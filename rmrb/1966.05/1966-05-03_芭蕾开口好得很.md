Title: Ballet Opening is Excellent

    Ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has added singing, which is really good. I raise both hands in approval. Adding singing can better express the dramatic content, help the audience understand the plot, allow us to hear clearly, see clearly, and understand deeply. For example, the song in the prologue tells of the suffering of the vast number of peasants in the old society and sings of the hatred of thousands of Xi'ers, allowing us to see the sins of the entire dark old society and hear the cries of countless peasants demanding to break the feudal shackles. Adding singing further highlights the characters and better shapes them. Because the dance and accompaniment are so harmoniously unified, Xi'er's image appears to be fleshed out and very full. Often, at key moments, a high-pitched song fully demonstrates Xi'er's spiritual world. It allows the audience to better understand Xi'er, to be closer to Xi'er, as if heart to heart with Xi'er. When Xi'er, covered in whip marks and filled with anger, escaped from the Huang family, the accompanist sang "I want to live, I want revenge." This song shook our hearts. We felt that this was not singing, but Xi'er was using all her strength to accuse and shout. It fully demonstrates Xi'er's strong character, tenacious fighting spirit, and the anger of revenge. Adding singing often creates an emotional exchange between the stage and the audience. Sometimes it not only sings the inner thoughts of the characters in the play, but also sings the inner thoughts of the audience. When the play depicts the White-Haired Girl and Dachun meeting, facing the sun and walking out of the cave, my mood was also very excited. I felt that I had a lot to say in my heart, and I really wanted to stand up and shout "Long live Chairman Mao." At this time, a passionate and exciting song began, "The sun is out, the sun is out, the sun is Mao Zedong, the sun is the Communist Party." This song seemed to burst out from the hearts of us in the audience, singing the infinite love of Xi'er and our audience for the Party and Chairman Mao.

    芭蕾开口好得很

    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》加了伴唱，加得实在好，我举双手赞成。加了唱，能更好地表现戏剧内容，帮助观众理解剧情，让我们听得清楚，看得明白，理解得深。象序幕的歌声诉出了旧社会广大农民的苦难，唱出了千百个喜儿的仇恨，使我们看到整个黑暗旧社会的罪恶，听到无数农民要求打碎封建枷锁的呼声。加了唱，更突出了人物性格，更好地塑造了人物。由于舞蹈与伴唱那样和谐地统一在一起，使喜儿的形象显得有血有肉，非常饱满。常常在关键时刻，一曲高歌，充分展现了喜儿的精神世界。使观众更了解喜儿，更接近喜儿，好象和喜儿心贴着心。当喜儿带着满身鞭痕，怀着满腔怒火逃出了黄家，伴唱者唱出“我要活，我要报仇。”这歌声把我们的心震动了。我们觉得这不是在歌唱，而是喜儿用全身力量在控诉，在呼喊。充分表现了喜儿坚强的性格，顽强的斗志，复仇的怒火。加了唱，常常使台上台下感情交流起来，有时不但唱出剧中人的心里话，而且唱出了观众的心里话。当剧中演到白毛女和大春相遇，迎着太阳，走出山洞，我的心情也非常激动，觉得心里有很多话要说，真想站起来喊一喊“毛主席万岁。”这时唱起了热情激动的歌声“太阳出来了，太阳出来了，太阳就是毛泽东，太阳就是共产党”，这歌象是从我们观众心里迸发出来的，唱出了喜儿，也唱出了我们观众对党，对毛主席的无比热爱。
