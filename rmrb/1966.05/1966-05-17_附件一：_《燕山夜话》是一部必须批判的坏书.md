    *Yan Shan Night Talks* is a Bad Book That Must Be Criticized
    Shang Leilin
    Ma Nan邨’s *Yan Shan Night Talks*, Volumes 1 to 5, is a bad book that must be criticized. Now, I will present my view on "Blocking is Worse Than Guiding," from the first volume.
    This article is about nine hundred words long. Ma Nan邨 said:
    "All things have various characteristics that are different from each other, and at the same time, all things must have their commonalities. Constant movement should be considered one of the commonalities of all things.
    Because all things have the power of constant movement, the attitude people take towards various moving forces is a fundamental issue that determines the success or failure, correctness or error, of people's actions.
    People can also take various different attitudes towards the forces of movement of things. In summary, there are two attitudes that are diametrically opposed. One is to block the path of the movement and development of things; the other is to actively guide them to develop smoothly. The former is wrong and doomed to fail; the latter is correct and bound to be victorious."
    This excerpt is the entirety of the article's gist, and the remaining text merely uses the legend of Yu the Great controlling the floods as an example to find "evidence" for his fallacious reasoning. The central idea of this article is that everything should be "actively guided to develop smoothly."
    This kind of view can only be welcomed by exploiters, aggressors, imperialists, and revisionists. This is reactionary philosophy. This is purely in the same vein as the "two combine into one" theory.
    Ma Nan邨 said: "All things have the power of constant movement." This is correct. There are no exceptions in nature and human society. For example, the healthy growth and occurrence of diseases in animals in nature, and the growth of seedlings and the growth of poisonous weeds in farmland all have the "power of constant movement." But Ma Nan邨 said: "Blocking the path of the movement and development of things... is wrong and doomed to fail." "Actively guiding them to develop smoothly... is correct and bound to be victorious." According to Ma Nan邨's statement, for example, if a person gets sick, then actively guiding the disease to develop smoothly would be correct. We know that the result of the smooth development of a disease is death. May I ask Ma Nan邨, is this "victory"? If you are the Grim Reaper, then this is your victory, but your theory cannot be applied to people who are growing healthily. For example, if poisonous weeds and seedlings grow together, don't they also "have the power of constant movement"? They do. According to Ma Nan邨's statement, we should fertilize them together, water them together, and hoe and loosen the soil together, "actively guiding" the poisonous weeds and seedlings to "develop smoothly" together, which would be "correct." May I ask Ma Nan邨, if you are planting crops, would you plant them like this?
    We also know that the exploiting classes' cruel exploitation and oppression of the working people "has the power of constant movement"; the counter-offensive and restoration activities of the overthrown exploiting classes also "have the power of constant movement"; the bourgeois ideology's corrosion of the revolutionary ranks also "has the power of constant movement"; the revisionists' sabotage of the communist movement and prohibition of revolution also "have the power of constant movement"; and the imperialists' claws of aggression extending to all parts of the world to kill and plunder are even more well-known "powers of constant movement." According to Ma Nan邨's theory, all of the above-mentioned "powers of constant movement" should be "actively guided to develop smoothly," which would be "correct." If this is not reactionary philosophy, then what is it? Ma Nan邨 wants to "actively guide" these movements to "develop smoothly," if this is not advocating reaction, then what is it?
    When Japanese imperialism invaded China, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang adopted a policy of non-resistance, not "blocking" the invaders' path of attack, but in name and reality "actively guiding them to develop smoothly." As a result, the invaders' iron hooves trampled our motherland for more than ten years. According to Ma Nan邨's logic, Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior was "correct"!
    When American imperialism invaded Korea, frantically charging at China's gate, the Chinese and Korean people united, not only "blocking" the path of American imperialism's attack, but also repelling its rampant offensive and driving it south of the 38th parallel. According to Ma Nan邨's logic, the Chinese and Korean people's actions to strike at American imperialism were "wrong"! We should build a few more bridges across the Yalu River, "actively guiding" American imperialism to develop smoothly towards China and socialist countries, which would be "correct"!
    How absurd is Ma Nan邨's fallacy to this extent!
    What modern revisionists are now doing is "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition" with imperialism. Isn't this the same as "guiding" imperialism's aggression? What modern revisionists are now doing is a movement "without armies and without weapons." Isn't this the same as abandoning the tools to "block" imperialist aggression? Ma Nan邨's theory that "blocking is worse than guiding" is precisely a theory that meets the needs of revisionism.
    We have overthrown the class enemies, but we must still exercise dictatorship over them, not allowing them to turn over and restore themselves. They have long felt suffocated. Ma Nan邨's theory that "blocking is worse than guiding" is precisely a theory that meets the needs of the overthrown class enemies.
    The claws of American imperialism's aggression are extending everywhere, but they are being "blocked" everywhere. Ma Nan邨's theory that "blocking is worse than guiding" is precisely a theory that meets the needs of American imperialism.
    Isn't the reactionary essence of the theory that "blocking is worse than guiding" now fully revealed?
    We believe that everything is divided into two. The movement of things is also basically divided into two kinds of movement. One is progressive, beneficial to the people, and revolutionary; the other is decadent, harmful to the people, and reactionary. Specific problems must be treated specifically, and we must never treat them all the same using the method of "two combine into one." Moreover, in fact, a certain kind of movement is never simply a movement in isolation: where there is an action force, there must be a reaction force; where there is a revolutionary movement, there must also be a counter-revolutionary movement. Therefore, to make the revolutionary movement develop smoothly, it is necessary to "block" the counter-revolutionary movement. There is blocking in guidance, and there is guidance in blocking; conducting guidance at the same time is conducting a kind of blocking, and conducting blocking at the same time is also conducting a kind of guidance; blocking this is for guiding that, and guiding this is for blocking that; "no destruction, no construction; no blockage, no flow; no stopping, no progress"; without eliminating capitalism, there can be no flourishing of the proletariat; without eliminating capitalism, imperialism, and the system of private ownership, the people cannot achieve complete liberation. This is an important link in dividing one into two. Ma Nan邨 advocates that no matter what kind of movement, we should all "actively guide it to develop smoothly," which in reality is opposing dividing one into two and is the same kind of stuff as the "two combine into one" theory.

    《燕山夜话》是一部必须批判的坏书
    尚乐林
    马南邨著的《燕山夜话》一至五集，是一部必须批判的坏书。现在，我就其第一集中《堵塞不如开导》一文，提出我的一点看法。
    这篇文章约九百字。马南邨说：
    “一切事物都有各不相同的种种特征，同时，一切事物又必定有它们的共同性。不停的运动应该算是一切事物的共同性之一。
    因为一切事物都有不停的运动的力量，所以人们对待各种运动的力量采取什么态度，则是决定人们的所作所为成功或失败、正确或错误的一个根本问题。
    人们对待事物运动的力量也可以采取种种不同的态度。归结起来，有两种态度是正相反对的。一种是堵塞事物运动发展的道路；一种是积极开导使之顺利发展。前者是错误的，注定会失败；后者是正确的，必然会胜利。”
    这段引文是该文主旨的全部，下余的文字不过以夏禹治水的传说为例，给他的歪道理找了一个“证据”。这篇文章的中心意思就是对一切事物都“应该积极开导使之顺利发展”。
    这种观点只能为剥削者、侵略者、帝国主义者、修正主义者所欢迎。这是反动哲学。这纯粹与“合二而一”论是一丘之貉。
    马南邨说：“一切事物都有不停的运动的力量”。这一点不错，自然界和人类社会的一切事物都没有例外，比如自然界的动物的健壮成长与疾病发生，庄稼地里的禾苗的生长与毒草的生长，都是有“不停的运动的力量”的。但是马南邨说：“堵塞事物运动发展的道路……是错误的，注定会失败”。“积极开导使之顺利发展……是正确的，必然会胜利”的。按照马南邨的说法，比如人生了病，那就应该积极开导疾病顺利发展才是正确的。我们知道疾病的顺利发展的结果是致人于死亡。请问马南邨，这是“胜利”吗？假如你是死神，那这就是你的胜利，但是你的理论又不能适用于健壮成长的人了。又比如毒草和禾苗一同生长起来了，难道它们不同样“都有不停的运动的力量”吗？有的。按照马南邨的说法去做，就应该一同施肥、一同浇灌、一同锄地松土，“积极开导”毒草与禾苗一同“顺利发展”，才是“正确的”。请问马南邨，如果你种庄稼，你是这样种吗？
    我们还知道，剥削阶级残酷地剥削压迫劳动人民“有不停的运动的力量”；被打倒了的剥削阶级的反攻复辟活动也“有不停的运动的力量”；资产阶级思想腐蚀革命队伍也“有不停的运动的力量”；修正主义破坏共产主义运动、不准革命也“有不停的运动的力量”；帝国主义侵略的魔爪伸向各地去杀人、去掠夺更是尽人皆知的“不停的运动的力量”。按照马南邨的理论，上述这些“不停的运动的力量”都应该“积极开导使之顺利发展”才是“正确的”。这不是反动的哲学又是什么呢？这些运动马南邨也要“积极开导使之顺利发展”，这不是鼓吹反动又是什么呢？
    日本帝国主义侵略中国，蒋匪帮采取不抵抗主义，不去“堵塞”侵略者的进攻道路，而名副其实地“积极开导使之顺利发展”，结果侵略者的铁蹄蹂躏我们祖国十多年。按照马南邨的逻辑，蒋匪帮的卖国行为反而是“正确的”！
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，疯狂地冲撞着中国的大门，中朝人民团结起来，不但“堵塞”了美帝进攻的道路，而且打退它的猖狂进攻，把它赶到三八线以南了。按照马南邨的逻辑，中朝人民打击美帝的行动反而是“错误的”！应该在鸭绿江上多架几座桥，“积极开导”美帝顺利地向中国、向社会主义国家发展才是“正确的”！
    马南邨的谬论何其荒唐一至于此！
    现代修正主义者现在搞的是与帝国主义“和平共处”、“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”，这不等于是“开导”帝国主义的侵略吗？现代修正主义者现在搞“没有军队、没有武器”的运动，这不等于是放弃“堵塞”帝国主义侵略的工具吗？马南邨的“堵塞不如开导”论正是适应修正主义需要的理论。
    我们把阶级敌人打倒了，还要对他们实行专政，不让他们翻过身来复辟。他们早就感到透不过气来。马南邨的“堵塞不如开导”论，正是适应被打倒了的阶级敌人的需要的理论。
    美帝国主义侵略的魔爪到处伸，但是到处遭到“堵塞”。马南邨的“堵塞不如开导”论，正是适应美帝国主义需要的理论。
    “堵塞不如开导”论的反动实质还不昭然若揭吗？
    我们认为，一切事物都是一分为二的。事物的运动也基本上分为两种运动。一种是进步的、对人民群众有益的、革命的运动；一种是腐朽的、对人民群众有害的、反动的运动。具体问题要具体对待，绝不能用“合二而一”的方法一视同仁的对待。并且，事实上，某一种运动也绝不是单纯的进行运动的：有作用力必有反作用力；有革命的运动必然同时有反革命的运动。因此，要使革命运动顺利发展，就必需“堵塞”反革命的运动。开导中有堵塞，堵塞中有开导；进行开导的同时就是进行一种堵塞，进行堵塞的同时也就是进行一种开导；堵塞这是为了开导那，开导这是为了堵塞那；“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”；不灭资就不能兴无；不消灭资本主义、帝国主义和私有制度，人民就不能获得彻底的解放。这就是一分为二的一个重要环节。马南邨主张不论什么样的运动，都一律“积极开导使之顺利发展”，实则是反对一分为二、与“合二而一”论同出一辙的货色。
