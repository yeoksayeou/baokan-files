    This newspaper's Daqing, 16th – Daqing Oilfield's Five-Good Pacesetters unanimously stated at a symposium held on the 12th: The people of Daqing are determined to join the people of the whole country, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, relentlessly open fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" black den and all monsters and demons, and defend the great socialist state.

    Wang Jinxi, National People's Congress representative, Daqing "Iron Man": Deng Tuo, the anti-Party and anti-socialist ringleader of this "Three-Family Village," along with his cronies, used "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" to publish hundreds of anti-Party and anti-socialist articles, harassing us for several years. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable to him, he resorted to some "Thirty-Six Stratagems, running away being the best," trying to slip away. Where does he think he's going to slip to! I think forty-six stratagems, fifty-six stratagems won't work either. We must peel off his black skin and expose his revisionist true colors. They waved their pens, engaged in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, colluding with American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries from within and without. Look, Chiang Kai-shek clamors for a counterattack on the mainland, and they cooperate; Khrushchev opposes communism and China, and they cooperate; right-leaning opportunists engage in "reversal of verdicts," and they cooperate; rural capitalist forces whip up a "going it alone" wind, and they also cooperate. They wear the same pants and speak with one voice as all the monsters and demons at home and abroad. Deng Tuo is completely a big rightist.

    I don't think there's anything to fear from a small group of rightists emerging. What is there to fear? We have the Party, we have Chairman Mao. Every revolutionary hard bone of ours must fight them to the end. Our Daqing Oilfield fights heaven, fights earth, and fights class enemies every year. There are many such revolutionary hard bones in our country. Can't we defeat this small group of people?

    They wrote so many reactionary articles, saying that the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind is a "cliché." Why did "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News" publish so many of these blatantly reactionary articles? I think there must be someone supporting them behind the scenes. We want to question "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News": you are all organs of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, why have you been controlled by such rightists for so long, poisoning people on a large scale, and becoming an anti-Party "independent kingdom"? I think there's something fishy here! We must not let you off easily this time. No matter how big an "authority" you are, how big a leader, you must make a thorough explanation to the people.

    Zhang Hongchi, National People's Congress representative, Instructor of Daqing Logging Detachment: This "Three-Family Village" black gang of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements has long controlled "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News," holding the "gun barrels" on the cultural front, firing black guns at the Party and socialism from behind, playing a role that imperialism and Khrushchev's modern revisionism cannot play. This is a life-and-death class struggle. If we don't carry out this struggle to the end, our country will change color, the Marxist-Leninist party will become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and millions of people will lose their heads!

    Deng Tuo, this rightist who slipped through the net, harbors a deep hatred for our Party. After the Party removed him from his "official" position at "People's Daily," he wrote reactionary articles opposing our Party. Just as imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries were conducting a grand chorus of anti-China, he struck the gong of "Yanshan Night Talks," an anti-Party and anti-socialist act, and joined with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to attack our great Party, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and even wanted to "pour dog blood" on our Party, "beat it with clubs," and demand that our Party step down and "rest." How malicious! He gnashed his teeth at us, and we must retaliate in kind. They must repay the debt they owe the people. This big poisonous weed must be eradicated. Our Daqing workers and the people of the whole country must thoroughly smash this anti-Party and anti-socialist group.

    What deserves our attention is "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News." They have long been selling a large quantity of anti-Party and anti-socialist black goods of Deng Tuo and his gang of rightists, and even recently were still covering up for them. What is their intention? Who is directing them? If they don't thoroughly explain those unspeakable dirty things this time, we will never give up.

    Xue Guobang, Five-Good Pacesetter, Deputy Commander of Oil Production: Deng Tuo slandered our Party, saying "grand empty words," "bragging." This is nonsense. Our Daqing Oilfield is a part of our country's great reality, and has long smashed their nonsense. We Chinese working class say one is one, two is two, and we do what we say. We don't fire blanks. Just when you were insulting our Party as "fanatical" and "having a fever," our Daqing workers, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, took down this large oilfield, and in a very short time, threw off our country's backward oil production, achieving basic self-sufficiency in our country's oil, and forever ending the era of relying on "foreign oil." This gave imperialism and revisionists a powerful slap in the face, and also a resounding slap in the face to Deng Tuo and his gang of anti-Party elements. I am an old oil worker. I remember in old China, a drilling rig couldn't even drill a thousand meters in a year; now we can drill a thousand meters in a day. In terms of oil extraction, we have developed a whole set of new technologies that others don't have. In short, in many aspects, what foreigners have, we have, and what foreigners don't have, we also have. Is this "grand empty words"? It is you yourselves who are "bashing your heads against the wall" in the face of ironclad facts.

    Pan Xingguo, Five-Good Pacesetter, Young Geologist of Daqing Oilfield Development and Research Institute: Deng Tuo gesticulated and cursed our Party, saying we "think too highly of ourselves, think it's easy to enter the door, and kick the teacher away." He thought we couldn't survive without revisionism. Let me tell you, we have long learned about the revisionist stuff. It is precisely because we don't rely on the revisionist "teacher" with ulterior motives that we are living even better. Here, it is enough to cite one fact. So many of our oil wells in Daqing have been producing high and stable yields. No oil well has experienced a decrease in production, and no oil well has experienced a decrease in pressure. This is a groundbreaking achievement in the history of world oilfield development. You can ask your foreign revisionist "teachers," have they ever had such a miracle as ours? These are all ironclad facts. Gentlemen, it is precisely because you helped Khrushchev brag too much that you are now bashing your heads against the wall in the face of facts!

    Wang Zhaohua, Five-Good Pacesetter, Young Female Pump Operator of Daqing Refinery: Our Daqing workers do not rely on heaven, do not rely on earth, and even less on revisionism. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought, on proletarian ambition, and with a speed that capitalist countries cannot imagine, we threw away the foreign crutches, designed our own equipment, and built a modern large-scale refinery ourselves, achieving four one-time successes (one-time design, one-time installation, one-time commissioning, one-time product output), and created a miracle in the history of Chinese and world refining. Imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism thought that if we left them, we could only use small teapot-style refining equipment to refine the worst oil products. Deng Tuo also thought that we couldn't survive without the Khrushchev revisionist "teacher." Facts have proved that whether it is imperialism, foreign revisionism, or Deng Tuo and his gang of domestic revisionist elements, their assertions have failed shamefully.

    Chen Shuying, Five-Good Pacesetter, Young Female Well Chief of Daqing Oilfield's Oil Production Well: Deng Tuo, you gang of big rightists, don't think about playing bad tricks on our younger generation. You think that our youth have not been tempered by class struggle, and always want to use the guise of talking about history, talking about knowledge, telling stories, and telling jokes to lure our young people to "peacefully evolve" in the past, and drill into the dead end of revisionism. You are blind and made the wrong calculation. No matter how cunning and insidious your methods are, we are the youth who grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and we are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and forge ahead bravely. Mao Zedong Thought is like a demon-revealing mirror, and all monsters and demons will show their true colors in front of us.

    Our Party defeated American imperialism and defeated Chiang Kai-shek by relying on people's war, relying on the masses of the people; in socialist construction, we developed a large oilfield by relying on the idea of people's war, relying on the strength of the masses of the people. Now, we are carrying out the socialist cultural revolution, also relying on the idea of people's war, relying on the workers, peasants, and soldiers, relying on the broad masses of the people. In this sharp class struggle, our working class stands at the forefront of the struggle, and we will thoroughly smash your "Three-Family Village" black den, and we will never give up until we win complete victory.

    Yuan Baiqin, Five-Good Family Member Pacesetter, Instructor of Daqing Drilling Third Family Production Team: Deng Tuo, in the first article of "Yanshan Night Talks," tempted us to use "one-third" of our spare time to read his "Yanshan black talk" and corrupt us. We were very angry when we saw it. Deng Tuo and these revisionists are engaging in "peaceful evolution," also wanting to open a gap in our workers' family life, and wanting to make plans for us in our spare time. This is absolutely impossible. In the past, some of our workers' families only had their eyes on a house, and their minds were only on their husbands and children, and they didn't care about national affairs. Now, our Daqing family members are making revolution, looking at Beijing, and thinking about the revolution of the people of the whole world. Everyone participates in labor, and everyone studies Chairman Mao's works, holding up half the sky of socialism. This has cut off the bourgeoisie's retreat. You want to take advantage of loopholes and restore capitalism, that is forever a dream.

    大庆油田五好标兵义正词严：
    我们每一个革命的硬骨头  都要同“三家村”黑帮斗到底
    本报大庆十六日电　大庆油田五好标兵在十二日举行的座谈会上一致表示：大庆人坚决和全国人民一道，高举毛泽东思想红旗，毫不留情地向反党反社会主义的黑线开火，彻底打垮“三家村”黑店和一切牛鬼蛇神，保卫伟大的社会主义江山。
    全国人民代表大会代表、大庆“铁人”王进喜：邓拓这个“三家村”的反党反社会主义头子，跟他的伙计一起，利用《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》发表了几百篇反党反社会主义的文章，搞了我们好几年。他看到形势对他不妙，搞什么“三十六计，走为上计”，想溜了。他往那里溜！我看四十六计，五十六计也不行。我们要把他的黑皮扒掉，让他显出修正主义的原形。他们摇着笔杆子，干反党反社会主义的勾当，和美帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派里应外合。你看，蒋介石叫嚣反攻大陆，他们配合上；赫鲁晓夫反共反华，他们配合上；右倾机会主义分子搞“翻案风”，他们配合上；农村资本主义势力刮“单干风”，他们也配合上。他们是同国内外各种牛鬼蛇神穿一条裤子，同一个鼻孔出气。邓拓完全是个大右派。
    出了一小撮右派，我看也没有什么可怕。怕什么呀，我们有党、有毛主席。我们每一个革命的硬骨头都要跟他们斗到底。我们大庆油田年年和天斗，和地斗，和阶级敌人斗。我们国家这样的革命硬骨头多得很，难道还斗不过这一小撮人？
    他们写了那么多反动文章，说什么东风压倒西风是“陈词滥调”。这样露骨的反动文章，为什么《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》大量地发表呢？我看他们后面一定有人支持。我们要质问《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，你们都是北京市委的机关刊物，为什么长期被这样的右派把持，大量地放毒，成了反党的“独立王国”呢？我看这里边有鬼！这次我们绝不能轻易放过你们。不管你是多大的“权威”，多大的头头，都得向人民彻底交代。
    全国人民代表大会代表、大庆测井中队指导员张洪池：邓拓这伙反党反社会主义的“三家村”黑帮，长期把持《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，拿着文化战线上的“枪杆子”，从背后向党向社会主义放黑枪，他们起着帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义所起不到的作用。这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，如果不把这场斗争进行到底，我们国家就要变颜色，马克思列宁主义的党就要变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，就会有千百万人头落地！
    邓拓这个漏网的大右派，对我们党怀着刻骨的仇恨。当党罢了他在《人民日报》的“官”以后，他大写反动文章，反对我们党。正当帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派搞反华大合唱的时候，他敲起《燕山夜话》这个反党、反社会主义的锣鼓，和地富反坏右等牛鬼蛇神一起来攻击我们伟大的党、伟大的毛泽东思想，还要对我们党“狗血淋头”，“打棍子”，要我们党下台“休息”，真是太恶毒了。他对我们咬牙切齿，我们就要以牙还牙。他们欠了人民的债是一定要偿还的。这棵大毒草一定要除掉。我们大庆职工和全国人民一定要彻底打垮“三家村”这个反党反社会主义的集团。
    值得我们注意的是《前线》《北京日报》《北京晚报》，他们长期大量贩卖邓拓一伙右派反党反社会主义的黑货，直到最近还在替他们打掩护，这究竟是什么企图？是谁在指使他们？这回他们不把那些见不得人的脏东西彻底交代出来，我们决不罢休。
    五好标兵，采油副指挥薛国邦：邓拓污蔑我们党说“伟大的空话”，“吹牛皮”，这是胡说八道。我们大庆油田就是我国伟大现实的一个部分，早就把他们的鬼话粉碎了。我们中国工人阶级说一是一，说二是二，说到做到，不放空炮。就在你们辱骂我们党“狂热”、“发高烧”的时候，我们大庆职工依靠毛泽东思想拿下来了这个大油田，在很短的时间内，甩掉了我国石油落后的帽子，做到了我国石油基本自给，永远结束了依靠“洋油”的时代。这给了帝国主义和修正主义者一记有力的耳光，也是对邓拓这伙反党分子一记响亮的耳光。我是老石油工人，记得在旧中国，一个钻机一年也打不了一千米；现在我们一天就可以打一千米了。在采油方面，我们自己搞成了一整套别人没有的新技术。总之，在许多方面，外国有的，我们有了，外国没有的，我们也有了。这难道是“伟大的空话”吗？在铁的事实面前“碰得头破血流”的是你们自己。
    五好标兵、大庆油田开发研究院青年地质师潘兴国：邓拓指手划脚咒骂我们党“自命不凡，看到入门很容易，就把老师一脚踢开”。以为我们离了修正主义就活不下去了。告诉你，修正主义那一套，我们早就领教过了，正因为我们不靠修正主义这个别有用心的“老师”，我们才活得更好。在这里，只要举一个事实就够了。我们大庆这么多油井，一直高产稳产，没有一口油井产量下降，没有一口油井压力下降。这是世界油田开发史上的创举。你可以去请教你们国外的修正主义“老师”，他们有过我们这样的奇迹吗？这都是铁的事实。先生们，正是你们帮赫鲁晓夫吹牛皮吹得太过了，现在你们在事实面前碰得头破血流了吧！
    五好标兵、大庆炼油厂青年女司泵工汪兆华：我们大庆职工不靠天，不靠地，更不靠修正主义，就是靠毛泽东思想，靠无产阶级志气，用资本主义国家想象不到的速度，甩开洋拐棍，自己设计，自己制造设备，自己安装建成了一座现代化的大型炼油厂，实现了四个一次成功（一次设计、一次安装、一次投产、一次出产品），创造了中国和世界炼油史上的奇迹。帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义，以为我们离开它们就只能用小茶壶式的炼油装置炼制最次的油品，邓拓也以为我们离开赫鲁晓夫修正主义“老师”就活不下去了，事实证明，不管是帝国主义，外国的修正主义，还是邓拓这伙国内修正主义分子，它们的断言都可耻地失败了。
    五好标兵、大庆油田采油井青年女井长陈淑英：邓拓，你们这伙大右派，别想在我们青年一代身上打坏主意。你们以为我们青年没经过阶级斗争锻炼，总想用谈历史、谈知识、讲故事、说笑话的幌子，引诱我们青年人“和平演变”过去，往修正主义的死胡同里钻，你们瞎了眼，打错了主意。不管你们手段多狡猾，多阴险，我们是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的青年，坚决高举毛泽东思想红旗奋勇前进。毛泽东思想就是个照妖镜，什么牛鬼蛇神，都会在我们面前显出原形。
    我们党打垮美帝国主义，打垮蒋介石，是靠人民战争，靠人民群众；在社会主义建设中我们搞出了大油田，也是靠人民战争思想，靠人民群众的力量。现在我们搞社会主义文化大革命，同样是靠人民战争思想，靠工农兵，靠广大人民群众。在这个尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们工人阶级站在斗争的最前列，要彻底捣毁你们的“三家村”黑店，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    五好家属标兵、大庆钻井第三家属生产队指导员苑柏琴：邓拓他在《燕山夜话》头一篇文章里，就引诱我们把“三分之一”的业余时间来读他的“燕山黑话”，腐蚀我们，我们看了非常气愤。邓拓这些修正主义分子搞“和平演变”，也想在我们职工家属生活中打开缺口，想在业余时间里打我们的主意，这是万万办不到的。过去，我们有的职工家属眼睛看的是一间房子，心里想的只有丈夫孩子，不关心国家大事。现在，我们大庆家属闹革命，眼看北京城，心里想的是全世界人民的革命，人人参加劳动，人人学习毛主席著作，顶了社会主义半边天。这就抄了资产阶级的后路。你们想要钻空子，搞资本主义复辟，永远是梦想。
