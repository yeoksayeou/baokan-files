    Last summer, when our ballet troupe lived and performed in Shanghai, we were delighted to see the ballet *The White-Haired Girl* by the Shanghai Dance School and were greatly inspired. This time, *The White-Haired Girl* came to Beijing for performance, and we watched it again. We deeply feel that they have made rapid progress, and this play has made new breakthroughs and improvements from content to form.

    The most prominent feature of the ballet *The White-Haired Girl* is the use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide creation, highlighting class struggle, highlighting the rebellious character of Chinese peasants, and truly doing credit to the poor and lower-middle peasants. At the same time, it also strengthened the line of armed struggle, so that this play can truly play the role of "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy."

    Not only is the ideological content more profound than the original, but also there are great breakthroughs in art. For example, they created the form of a chorus, which can not only better express the content, but also make it easier for the audience to understand. In fact, it makes ballet more popular.

    The actors' performances are also very successful. For example, the actors vividly express the spiritual outlook of Xi'er, a rebellious poor peasant's daughter. In the scene at the Grandmother Temple, the White-Haired Girl (Xi'er) and Huang Shiren meet each other with extreme hatred, which is expressed very powerfully, highlighting Xi'er's strong class hatred in her heart; Dachun also plays well and has the temperament of a peasant. Other roles are also performed very successfully, with the thoughts and feelings of poor and lower-middle peasants.

    Why are they able to perform so successfully? It is mainly because they emphasize politics, study Chairman Mao's works hard, and learn and apply them flexibly; they insist on going deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, and integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and transform their thoughts and feelings. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they dare to think and dare to break old frameworks and foreign dogmas, and dare to establish new socialist ideas and establish the difference of the proletariat. They have made great achievements in revolutionization, nationalization, and popularization. These are all worthy of our study.

    From the performance of ballet, we deeply realize that "three-izations" begins with revolutionization. Only by first revolutionizing in thought can we achieve nationalization and popularization in art. We have undertaken the performance work in the ballet *The Red Detachment of Women*. We have realized that to perform well, we must first study Chairman Mao's works well and transform our thoughts well. In this regard, the comrades in Shanghai are ahead of us, which makes us think even more that we should take the opportunity of the ballet *The White-Haired Girl* performing in Beijing to learn from our colleagues and comrades in Shanghai.

    向上海的同行们学习
    刘庆棠　赵汝衡
    去年夏天，我们芭蕾舞团的同志们在上海生活和演出时，高兴地看到了上海舞蹈学校的芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，受到很大的启发。这次《白毛女》来京演出，我们又看了一次。我们深深感到，他们进步很快，这出戏从内容到形式又有了新的突破和提高。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》最突出的特点，就是运用毛泽东思想来指导创作，突出了阶级斗争，突出了中国农民的反抗性格，真正做到了为贫下中农立传。同时也加强了武装斗争这条线，使这出戏真正能起到“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的作用。
    不仅思想内容比原作更为深刻，在艺术上也有很大的突破，例如，他们创造了伴唱的形式，不仅能更好地表现内容，而且能使观众更容易看懂。实际上是使芭蕾更群众化了。
    演员的表演也是很成功的。例如演员把喜儿这个富于反抗性的贫苦农民的女儿的精神面貌活灵活现地表现出来了。在奶奶庙这一场，白毛女（喜儿）和黄世仁仇人相见，分外眼红，表现得很有力量，突出表现了喜儿胸中强烈的阶级仇恨；大春也演得很好，有农民的气质。其他角色也表演得很成功，有贫下中农的思想感情。
    他们为什么能演得那么成功呢？主要是因为他们突出政治，努力学习毛主席著作，并且活学活用；他们坚持深入工农兵，和工农兵打成一片，改造思想感情。他们在毛泽东思想指导下，敢想敢闯，敢于打破老框框，洋教条，敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。在革命化、民族化、群众化方面做出了巨大的成绩。这些都是值得我们好好学习的。
    从芭蕾舞的演出，我们深深体会到，“三化”首先是革命化，只有首先在思想上革命化，才能在艺术上做到民族化、群众化。我们在芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》中担负了演出工作，我们体会到，要演好戏，首先要学好毛主席著作，要改造好思想。在这方面，上海的同志们走在我们前面，这就更使我们想到，趁芭蕾舞《白毛女》在北京演出的机会，要好好地向上海的同行们、同志们学习。
