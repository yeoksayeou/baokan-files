    Jakarta's Night of Terror
    Japanese Newspaper Reporter Says Armed Bandits Rampant in Jakarta at Night
    Overseas Chinese and Other Foreign Merchants Frequently Robbed and Extorted
    (Xinhua News Agency, June 6th dispatch) Tokyo News: According to reports in the "Asahi Shimbun" on April 27th and 29th, the capital Jakarta, under the rule of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, suffers from extremely poor social order due to armed bandits and thugs in military uniforms robbing and setting fires everywhere, causing residents and foreigners to live in constant anxiety.
    "Asahi Shimbun" Jakarta correspondent, Lin Rijie's report said, "Recently, almost every night in the city (Jakarta), there have been incidents of armed gangs in military uniforms attacking and burning shops, warehouses, and robbing pedestrians and residences. The main target of the attacks is overseas Chinese merchants, but in recent days, attacks on other foreigners have also been increasing."
    The report said, "The dormitory of a Japanese company employee living in the new Kebayoran district in the southern suburbs of Jakarta was recently broken into by a gang of robbers in the middle of the night when people were sound asleep, who stole many pieces of furniture, electrical appliances, and cash."
    The report said, "In the Menteng district, where the diplomatic missions and official residences of various countries are concentrated, incidents of armed robbers robbing pedestrians often occur."
    The report said that such cases of open robbery occur most frequently in areas where overseas Chinese merchants are concentrated. In areas where overseas Chinese merchants are concentrated, "large numbers of armed gangs go out to rob every night, and even during the day, many people in student uniforms and military uniforms harass and extort large sums of money. Therefore, many overseas Chinese merchants now have to close their shops and hide in homes far away from their shops, and economic activity has virtually ceased."
    The report said: Starting from the Indonesian military's attack on the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta on October 16th last year, "the spearhead of the right-wing elements' attacks has been directed at Chinese diplomatic missions and shops opened by overseas Chinese, as well as ordinary Chinese nationals. After several attacks on the Chinese consulates in Medan (Sumatra) and Makassar (Sulawesi), large-scale looting and arson attacks were continuously carried out against overseas Chinese merchants in various commercial cities by the end of the year."

    雅加达的恐怖之夜
    日本报纸记者说雅加达夜晚武装盗匪横行
    华侨和其他外侨商人经常遭到抢劫和勒索
    据新华社六日讯　东京消息：据《朝日新闻》四月二十七日和二十九日报道，在印度尼西亚右派军人政权统治下的首都雅加达，由于穿着军服的武装盗匪和暴徒四出抢劫放火，社会治安极坏，居民和外侨都惶惶不安。
    《朝日新闻》驻雅加达记者林理介的报道说，“最近（雅加达）市内几乎每夜都发生穿着军服的武装强盗集团袭击和烧毁商店、仓库和抢劫行人、住宅的事件。袭击的主要对象是华侨商人，但是近几天来对其他外国人的袭击也在日益增加。”
    报道说，“居住在雅加达南郊新克巴约兰区的日本公司职员的宿舍，最近在人员甜睡的夜里，竟被强盗集团破门而入，抢去许多家具、电气用具和现金。”
    报道说，“在各国外交使团和官员住宅集中的门腾地区，常常发生武装强盗抢劫行人的事件。”
    报道说，这种公开抢劫的事例在华侨商人集中的地方发生的最多。在华侨商人集中的地区，“每夜都有大批的武装强盗集团出动抢劫，就是在白天也有不少穿学生服和军服的人去骚扰，大量的勒索金钱。所以，现在许多华侨商人不得不关上店门，躲在离商店很远的家里，经济活动实际上已经停止。”
    报道说：从去年十月十六日印度尼西亚军人袭击雅加达中国大使馆商务参赞处开始，“右派分子的攻击的矛头，就针对着中国的外交机关和华侨开设的商店以及一般的中国侨民。对棉兰（苏门答腊）望加锡（苏拉威西）中国领事馆进行了几次袭击之后，到年末就不断地对各商业城市的华侨商人进行了大规模地抢劫和纵火烧毁。”
