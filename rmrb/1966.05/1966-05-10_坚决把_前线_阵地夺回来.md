    Resolutely Recapture the "Front" Position
    Worker of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Liu Fangyou
    Currently, a fierce class struggle is unfolding on the cultural front. "Qianxian" (Front), a publication sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, should, in principle, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, correctly reflect and guide work, and speak for us workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, since October 1961, "Qianxian" has been controlled by anti-Party, anti-socialist elements Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, and Wu Han, with Deng Tuo as the chief commander, peddling bourgeois private goods, turning the red "Front" on the proletarian cultural front into a black "Front" on the bourgeois cultural front, opening the black den of "Three-Family Village," releasing a large amount of poisonous weeds, attacking the General Line, and attacking our great Party.
    We want to tell these anti-Party elements that we steelworkers will not allow you to use vicious language such as "drenching with dog's blood" and "hitting with a blunt instrument" to curse the Chinese Communist Party that liberated us from the mass graves; we will not allow you to use phrases such as "suffering from the loss of subjectivism, suffering from the loss of dogmatism, being self-righteous" to attack the Three Red Banners out of thin air. During the Great Leap Forward, we steelworkers brought about earth-shaking changes in Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. From then on, the days of having iron but no steel were gone forever, and the level of iron-making production also climbed to the world's peak. We want you to come out of that stinking "Three-Family Village" to see our real life, to see how despicable your slander is!
    "Things in the world are like this. A bell does not ring if it is not struck. A table does not move if it is not carried." We steelworkers will open our iron hands, wield our pens, and recapture the "Front" position of the proletarian cultural front. The red line and the black line can never coexist peacefully, we must fight to the end.
    The red line will win, and the black line will lose!

    坚决把“前线”阵地夺回来
    石景山钢铁厂工人　刘方友
    现在，文化战线上正在展开一场激烈的阶级斗争。《前线》是中共北京市委主办的刊物，照理应当高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，正确地反映和指导工作，替我们工农兵说话。可是，从一九六一年十月以来，《前线》却被反党、反社会主义分子邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗所把持，以邓拓为主帅，贩卖资产阶级私货，将无产阶级文化战线上的红色“前线”，搞成了资产阶级文化战线上的黑色“前线”，开起了“三家村”这个黑店，大放毒草，攻击总路线，攻击我们伟大的党。
    我们要告诉这些反党分子，我们钢铁工人，不允许你们用所谓“狗血淋头”“打闷棍”等恶毒的语言，来咒骂从万人坑中把我们解放出来的中国共产党；不允许你们用所谓“吃了主观主义的亏，吃了教条主义的亏，自以为是”，来无中生有地攻击三面红旗。我们钢铁工人在大跃进年代，使石钢来了一个天翻地覆的变化。从此有铁无钢的日子一去不复返了，而且炼铁生产水平也攀登上了世界高峰。我们要你们走出那个臭气熏天的“三家村”来看看我们的现实生活，看看你们的诬蔑是多么可耻！
    “世界上的事情，都是这样。钟不敲是不响的。桌子不搬是不走的。”我们钢铁工人要张开铁手，挥起大笔，夺回无产阶级的文化战线的“前线”阵地。红线和黑线是绝不能和平共处的，我们一定要斗争到底。
    红线必胜，黑线必败！
