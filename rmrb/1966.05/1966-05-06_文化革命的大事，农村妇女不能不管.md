    The Great Affairs of the Cultural Revolution, Rural Women Cannot Ignore
    Hou Xiuying, Director of the Women's Federation of the Lugouqiao People's Commune
    I am a rural woman. In the past, I always felt that as long as I worked hard and did my job well, that would be enough. The Cultural Revolution was something for intellectuals to do. After studying the *People's Liberation Army Daily* editorial, I realized that this idea was wrong. The Cultural Revolution is a serious class struggle, and we rural women cannot ignore it!
    The law of class struggle is like this: if you don't eliminate it, it will devour you. Since liberation, there has been a black line on the cultural front that opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought. The overthrown class enemies and their spokespersons in the literary and art circles, seeing that we are living well, are unwilling to accept it and always want to drag us back to the old capitalist road. At the slightest sign of trouble, they croak like toads, especially during the three years of difficulties, they croaked particularly loudly, saying things like "write truthfully," and "write about middle characters," with many names. In the end, their ulterior political motive is to not want socialism. They say that we peasants are distressed and forced to take the path of communization, which is complete nonsense. This is slandering us poor and lower-middle peasants, slandering the Party's policies. Take our rural women, for example. Before liberation, we couldn't hold our heads up at all. The Party not only liberated women from the eighteen layers of hell but also liberated us from the kitchen stove. We participated in production, happily followed the Party, and wholeheartedly took the road of socialism. The unhappy people, the distressed people, are the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. Before liberation, they opened their mouths for food and reached out for clothing; now, they can no longer exploit and oppress people. Those who slander us poor and lower-middle peasants are speaking on behalf of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. We must keep our eyes open and resolutely fight them to the end.
    We are revolutionary peasants, and we love to watch revolutionary operas and sing revolutionary songs. We understand operas like *Li Shuangshuang* and *The Seal*, and we get more and more addicted to them. We just don't like to watch those old operas with squeaky voices, maids, and young ladies. In the future, we rural women must actively participate in this great cultural revolution. We have the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. No matter what kind of monsters and demons, we can see through them and criticize them.

    文化革命的大事，农村妇女不能不管
    芦沟桥人民公社妇联主任　侯秀英
    我是个农村妇女，过去我总觉得只要好好劳动，搞好工作就行了，文化革命那都是文化人干的事情。学习了《解放军报》社论以后，认识到这种想法是不对的，文化革命是一场严重的阶级斗争，我们农村妇女不能不管！
    阶级斗争的规律就是这样的：你不消灭它，它便吃掉你。解放十几年来，文化战线上就有一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线。被打倒的阶级敌人和他们在文艺界的代言人，看见我们过好日子不甘心，总想把我们拉回资本主义老路去。一有风吹草动，他们就象癞蛤蟆一样哇哇乱叫，特别在三年困难时期，他们叫得特别凶，说什么“写真实”啦，什么“写中间人物”啦，名目很多。说来绕去，他们的不可告人的政治目的就是不要社会主义。他们说我们农民走公社化道路很苦恼，是被迫的，这完全是胡说八道。这是诬蔑我们贫下中农，诬蔑党的方针政策。就拿我们农村妇女来说，解放前根本抬不起头来，党不但把妇女从十八层地狱里解放出来，还把我们从锅台边解放出来。我们参加了生产，高高兴兴地跟党走，一心一意地走社会主义的大道。不高兴的人、苦恼的人倒是有的，那就是地富反坏分子。他们解放前是饭来张口，衣来伸手；现在，他们没法再剥削人压迫人了。诬蔑我们贫下中农的人，是在代表地富反坏说话。我们要擦亮眼睛，坚决跟他们斗到底。
    我们是革命农民，就是爱看革命戏，爱唱革命歌。《李双双》、《夺印》这些戏，我们一看就懂，越看越上瘾，就是不爱看那些吱吱呀呀、丫环小姐的旧戏。今后，我们农村妇女要积极参加这场文化大革命。我们有毛泽东思想这个武器，不管什么牛鬼蛇神，我们都能识透，都能批倒。
