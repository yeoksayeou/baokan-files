    Smash the Black Den, Eradicate the Black Line, Carry the Revolution Through to the End!
    Yan'an People Angrily Counterattack the "Three-Family Village" Black Gang
    The broad masses of the people in the revolutionary sacred land of Yan'an, including veteran Red Army soldiers, veteran Red Guards, veteran guerrillas, veteran Party members, veteran cadres, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals, have held meetings, seminars, written articles, and written letters since early May, angrily criticizing the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of the "Three-Family Village" black gang. The people of Yan'an are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the "Three-Family Village" black den, eradicate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.
    Whoever Dares to Attack the Party Central Committee, We Will Fight Them to the End
    The people of Yan'an, with deep love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, angrily counterattacked the "Three-Family Village" anti-Party group's rampant attacks on the Party. Bai Yude, a veteran guerrilla captain who participated in the defense of Yan'an in those years, said at a meeting: Deng Tuo and his black-hearted gang dared to attack our great Party, demanding that our Party quickly step down and "rest." When I heard this, my lungs were about to explode with anger. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. If it weren't for the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, how could we have defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang? If it weren't for the Party's leadership, where would the great achievements of the national socialist revolution and socialist construction come from? Not to mention anything else, just look at the construction of Yan'an! The Kuomintang said they would build a bridge and even collected money from the people, but they didn't build it. Now, Yan'an has built two large bridges, and also built the more than one hundred li long Yan-Hui Canal, as well as built roads, installed electric lights... which one is not due to the good leadership of the Communist Party? Our people across the country cannot do without the Communist Party for a moment! Whoever wants to attack the Party Central Committee, whoever dares to demand that the Party step down, we will fight them to the end! I participated in the defense of Yan'an. In those years, the People's Liberation Army and the guerrillas, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, defeated the hundreds of thousands of Jiang-Hu bandit troops with millet plus rifles. Today, Deng Tuo and you anti-Party elements dare to attack the Party, we the people of Yan'an will take the same spirit we had back then in defending the Party Central Committee and defending Chairman Mao, and completely defeat you!
    Yang Chengfu, the old township head of Zaoyuan Township, where Chairman Mao lived in Zaoyuan, said at a symposium: Chairman Mao loves the people, and the people all love Chairman Mao. Our poor and lower-middle peasants have always had a red heart towards the Party and towards our respected Chairman Mao. Deng Tuo's black gang, you can forget about destroying the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the people! When the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived in our Zaoyuan, Chairman Mao himself often solicited our opinions, told us revolutionary truths, and helped us arrange production and life. The Happiness Canal in front of our village now was built back then with Chairman Mao discussing it with us. The leading comrades of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao also personally paid New Year's visits to the masses and invited the villagers to watch yangko dances. When watching the yangko dances, Chairman Mao let the masses sit in front, and he and the cadres sat behind. When the Jiang-Hu bandit gang invaded Yan'an, Chairman Mao was the last to leave, and before leaving, he asked if the villagers had all left. There is no end to the things like this that Chairman Mao did to love the people. After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao went to Beijing, they sent people many times to visit us. The cadres in the county also followed Chairman Mao's teachings, going to our team to eat, live, work, and study with the poor and lower-middle peasants. See, how much the Party and Chairman Mao care about the people, how much they value us poor and lower-middle peasants! However, Deng Tuo and his gang of counter-revolutionary elements, curse our Party for being "self-righteous" and "looking down on the masses," which is really blatant nonsense! Our poor and lower-middle peasants will never forget the care of the Party and Chairman Mao for generations. We resolutely disagree with your slander of the Party. We must cut the weeds and eliminate the roots, and dig out and clean up all of you counter-revolutionary poisonous weeds!
    Mao Zedong Thought is the Lighthouse of World Revolution, Our Friends are All Over the World
    Based on their own experiences, the people of Yan'an deeply understand that Mao Zedong Thought is not only the lighthouse of the Chinese people's revolution, but also the lighthouse of the world's people's revolution. Yang Zaiqing, an old poor peasant from the Yangjialing Production Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Yan'an County, said at a symposium: Chairman Mao is not only the wise leader of the Chinese people, but also the wise leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world. Chairman Mao's words speak to the hearts of the working people all over the world. In order to seek liberation and freedom, the oppressed people all over the world regard the new China led by Chairman Mao as an example for their revolution. Our friends are all over the world, and more and more people are coming to China to learn revolutionary experience. Deng Tuo and this gang of bad guys, however, viciously attack our Party, attack the great Mao Zedong Thought, saying that we are "making enemies everywhere" and "unpopular," becoming more and more isolated. When we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yangjialing, heard these ghost words, we were filled with anger and wished we could pinch these poisonous insects to death with one fingernail. Our Yangjialing is where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao worked. The number of foreign friends who come here to visit is increasing year by year. In Juna (a month), there are five or six batches, and last year there were more than 1,000 people from more than 60 countries. They praised: "Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people, the savior of the Asian people, the helmsman of the world people, and the banner bearer against imperialism and revisionism." "With Chairman Mao, it is not only the happiness of the Chinese people, but also the happiness of the world people." "To make revolution is to be like China." Many people buy Chairman Mao's works here and take back bags of soil from the land that Chairman Mao cultivated. Last year, the Japanese youth delegation who came here also had a party with the youth of Yan'an, singing revolutionary songs such as "Workers of All Countries, Unite!" Our friends are increasing day by day, this iron-like fact is clearly seen by all of us living in the mountains of Yan'an. Deng Tuo and his gang, you live in the capital Beijing, why can't you see it? Are you blind?!
    This old poor peasant continued: We have already seen through the internal organs of Deng Tuo and his gang. You and the Khrushchev revisionists are sitting on the same bench, saying the same thing, playing the same tricks. The fact is that our revolutionary friends are increasing day by day, and if there are fewer, that is because there are fewer revisionists like you coming. You falsely say that we are "unpopular," we are getting the hearts of the revolutionary people who account for more than 90% of the world's population, and we don't want the hearts of you a small handful of revisionist bad eggs. You say that we are "making enemies everywhere," we just want to "make" you revisionist elements as enemies. Not only do we want to "make" you enemies, but we also want to fight, resolutely fight, fight to the end, until you are completely finished! You want to scare us with something like "making enemies everywhere" and "unpopular," so that we will no longer oppose modern revisionism, and ask us to worship Khrushchev revisionism as a "teacher" and lead us on the path of revisionism. This is completely daydreaming! Twenty years ago, when Chairman Mao was in Yan'an, he said: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Deng Tuo, you handful of anti-Party elements, how much ability do you have after all? You want to overthrow our Party, oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, you can only "bump your heads and bleed"!
    Resolutely Take the Socialist Road, Absolutely Not Allow Capitalist Restoration
    The people of Yan'an deeply understand that the socialist country, built by countless revolutionary martyrs who shed their blood and sweat and went through all kinds of hardships, is the lifeline of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and absolutely will not allow the counter-revolutionary black gang to carry out capitalist restoration. Cao Zhengui, the political instructor of the Liulin Brigade of the Liulin Commune in Yan'an County and an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works, said at a symposium: Socialism is the lifeline of our working people. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led our working people to make revolution, work hard, and sacrifice blood to overthrow the old China and seize power, precisely in order to build a strong socialist new country and gradually move towards communism. With great difficulty, we have built a socialist country and embarked on the socialist road, but Deng Tuo and this gang of bad eggs regard it as a thorn in their side. They viciously curse our socialist construction cause as "finished," and clamor for us to "enlighten" the "individual farming wind" and "put down" socialism. This is to make our working people return to the old society of exploitation and oppression. Our poor and lower-middle peasants all know that only by taking the road of agricultural collectivization pointed out by Chairman Mao can we truly live a good life. Starting in 1943, the peasants of Yan'an actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "get organized," organized mutual aid teams and labor exchange teams, and carried out the agricultural production movement, smashed the poison plan of the encirclement and blockade of the border areas by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, overcame material difficulties, and achieved food and clothing. After the national liberation, we established cooperatives and realized the communization, and embarked on the broad road of socialism. Especially since 1958, under the guidance of the general line, relying on the collective strength of the people's communes, the face of production has undergone even greater changes. Our entire brigade has built more than 200 mu of irrigated land, more than 200 mu of terraced fields, the grain yield has increased by nearly double, and we have also built more than 400 mu of economic forests and timber forests, with green trees lining the villages and roads. Electric lights, electric mills, and electric grinding machines have also been installed, and the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants are getting better and better. The working people across the country are all happy. Deng Tuo and his gang, however, stand on the position of landlords and the bourgeoisie, and vainly attempt to pave the way for capitalist restoration. We want to tell you frankly that your trickery is wrong. What is truth, goodness, and beauty, and what is falsehood, evil, and ugliness, we know clearly in our hearts, and we will never be fooled by you or deceived by you. Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we must resolutely take the socialist road, defend the socialist country, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end.
    The Poisonous Weeds Above Ground Must Be Pulled Out, the Bad Roots Buried Underground Must Be Dug Out
    The people of Yan'an, holding a deep hatred for the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, are determined to weed out the roots and thoroughly dig out and completely defeat Deng Tuo and his gang and their behind-the-scenes instigators. He Shushan and Wei Qingming, two veteran Red Army soldiers from the Yan'an August 1st Veterans Home who followed Chairman Mao on the Long March, jointly published an article in the "Yan'an Daily." The title of the article is: "Weeding Must Remove the Roots." The article questions "Frontline," "Beijing Daily," and "Beijing Evening News": In the past few years, the class enemies at home and abroad stirred up a black wind and frantically attacked the Party. From your mouths, you also spewed out the poisonous water of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha. Whose idea was this? Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes have been exposed one by one. You are playing the trick of "sacrificing pawns to save the generals." Whose plan is this? There is a king if there is a thief, and there is a general if there is a commander. You must thoroughly confess.
    The article said: We Yan'an people have a saying: "If you don't remove the roots when weeding, the disaster will be there next spring." This is also our experience from decades of struggle. We must take the same fighting spirit as we had during the Long March and pull out all the anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, roots and vines. Whether they are exposed on the ground or buried underground, we must pull them out. We are the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we have the determination and confidence to eradicate this anti-Party and anti-socialist black line under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

### 捣毁黑店　铲除黑线　革命到底  延安人民愤怒反击“三家村”黑帮

    捣毁黑店　铲除黑线　革命到底
    延安人民愤怒反击“三家村”黑帮
    革命圣地延安的广大人民，包括老红军、老赤卫队员、老游击队员、老党员、老干部和广大工农兵、革命知识分子，五月上旬以来，纷纷集会、座谈、写稿、写信，愤怒批判“三家村”黑帮的反党反社会主义罪行。延安人民决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底捣毁“三家村”黑店，铲除反党反社会主义黑线，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    谁敢攻击党中央，我们就和他拼到底
    延安人民怀着对党中央、毛主席深厚的爱戴之情，愤怒反击“三家村”反党集团对党的猖狂进攻。参加过当年保卫延安战斗的老游击队长白玉德在一次集会上说：邓拓这一帮黑心的家伙，胆敢攻击我们伟大的党，要我们党赶快下台“休息”。我知道以后，肺都要气炸了。没有共产党，就没有新中国。要不是党中央、毛主席的英明领导，怎么能打败日本帝国主义、国民党匪帮？要不是党的领导，哪有全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成绩？不说别的，光说延安的建设吧！国民党说过要修桥，还敛过老百姓的钱，可是没有修。如今，延安修起了两座大桥，还修了一百多里长的延惠渠，还有修公路，安电灯……哪一样不是共产党的好领导？我们全国人民，一时也离不开共产党！谁要攻击党中央，谁敢要求党下台，我们就和他拼到底！我参加过保卫延安的战斗。当年，解放军、游击队在毛主席领导下，用小米加步枪打败了大炮加飞机的几十万蒋胡匪军。今天，邓拓你们这伙反党分子竟敢向党进攻，我们延安人民就要拿出当年保卫党中央、保卫毛主席的劲头来，把你们彻底打垮！
    毛主席在延安枣园居住时的枣园乡老乡长杨成福在座谈会上说：毛主席热爱人民，人民都热爱毛主席。我们贫下中农从来就是一颗红心向着党，向着敬爱的毛主席。邓拓黑帮，你们休想破坏党和人民的血肉关系！党中央、毛主席在我们枣园住的时候，毛主席他老人家常亲自向我们征求意见，给我们讲革命道理，帮助我们安排生产和生活。现在我们村跟前那条幸福渠，就是当年毛主席和我们一块商量修起来的。毛主席和党中央的领导同志还亲自给群众拜年，请乡亲们看秧歌。看秧歌的时候，毛主席让群众坐在前头，他老人家和干部都坐在后头。蒋胡匪帮进犯延安的时候，毛主席是最后离开的，临起身，还问老乡们走完了没有。象这样毛主席爱人民的事情，是说也说不完的。党中央、毛主席到北京以后，还多次派人来看望我们。县上的干部也遵照毛主席的教导，到我们队里跟贫下中农同吃同住同劳动同学习。看，党和毛主席是多么关心人民，多么看重我们贫下中农！可是，邓拓这伙反革命分子，却骂我们党“自作聪明”，“瞧不起群众”，这真是睁着眼瞎胡说！我们贫下中农祖祖辈辈都忘不了党和毛主席的关怀。你们污蔑党，我们坚决不答应。我们要斩草除根，把你们这些反革命的毒草都挖出来，锄干净！
    毛泽东思想是世界革命的灯塔，我们的朋友遍天下
    延安人民根据自己的亲身经历，深切地体会到，毛泽东思想既是中国人民革命的灯塔，又是全世界人民革命的灯塔。“三家村”黑帮反对毛泽东思想，就是反对中国革命，反对世界革命。延安县城关公社杨家岭生产大队老贫农杨在清在座谈会上说：毛主席不光是中国人民的英明领袖，也是全世界革命人民的英明领袖。毛主席的话，句句说到全世界劳动人民的心窝里。全世界受压迫人民为了求解放，得自由，把毛主席领导的新中国当作他们革命的榜样。我们的朋友遍天下，到中国来学习革命经验的人越来越多。邓拓这一帮坏家伙，却恶毒地攻击我们党，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，说我们“到处树敌”、“不得人心”，越来越孤立了。我们杨家岭的贫下中农，听见这些鬼话，满肚子冒火，恨不得把这群毒虫一指甲掐死。我们杨家岭，是党中央、毛主席工作过的地方。外国朋友来这里参观访问的，一年比一年多。这几年，均拉一个月就有五六批，去年来的就有六十多个国家的一千多人。他们称赞说：“毛主席是中国人民的领袖，亚洲人民的救星，世界人民的舵手，反帝反修的旗手。”“有了毛主席，不仅是中国人民的幸福，也是世界人民的幸福。”“干革命就要象中国这样。”不少人在这里买上毛主席著作，从毛主席种过的地里带上包土回去。去年来的日本青年代表团，还在我们杨家岭和延安青年一起联欢，一块唱《全世界人民团结起来》等革命歌曲。我们的朋友越来越多，这个铁一般的事实，我们住在延安山区的人都看得清清楚楚。邓拓一伙，你们住在首都北京，为啥会看不见？难道你们是瞎子？！
    这位老贫农接着说：我们早把邓拓一伙的五脏六肺看透了。你们和赫鲁晓夫修正主义坐在一条板凳上，说的一个话，搞的一个鬼。事实是我们的革命朋友越来越多，如果说少了，那就是同你们一伙的修正主义分子来的少了。你们胡说我们“不得人心”，我们得的是占世界人口百分之九十几的革命人民的心，就是不要得你们这一小撮修正主义坏蛋的心。你们说我们“到处树敌”，我们就是要“树”你们这号修正主义分子作敌人。不光要“树”，还要斗，坚决斗，斗到底，直到你们全完蛋！你们想拿什么“到处树敌”、“不得人心”吓唬我们，让我们不再反对现代修正主义，叫我们拜赫鲁晓夫修正主义当“老师”，把我们引上修正主义的道路。这完全是大白天作梦！二十年前，毛主席在延安的时候就说过：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。”邓拓你们这一小撮反党分子，究竟有多大本领？你们想推翻我们的党，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，只能“碰得头破血流”！
    坚决走社会主义道路，绝不许搞资本主义复辟
    延安人民深深懂得，无数革命先烈抛头颅、洒热血，历尽艰难困苦建立起来的社会主义国家，是中国人民和世界革命人民的命根子，绝不允许反革命黑帮搞资本主义复辟。延安县柳林公社柳林大队政治指导员、学习毛主席著作积极分子曹振贵在座谈会上说：社会主义是我们劳动人民的命根子。共产党、毛主席领导我们劳动人民闹革命，艰苦奋斗，流血牺牲，推翻旧中国，掌握印把子，为的就是要建设一个富强的社会主义的新国家，逐步走向共产主义。好不容易，我们打下了社会主义江山，走上了社会主义道路，邓拓这一伙坏蛋却看作是眼中钉。他们恶毒地咒骂我们社会主义建设事业“完蛋”了，胡说什么要我们“开导”“单干风”，“放下”社会主义。这是想让我们劳动人民重新回到受剥削、受压迫的旧社会。我们贫下中农都知道，只有走毛主席指出的农业集体化的道路，才能真正过好日子。从一九四三年开始，我们延安的农民就积极响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，组织起变工队、扎工队等农业互助组织，开展了农业大生产运动，粉碎了蒋介石反动派包围封锁边区的毒计，克服了物质困难，达到了丰衣足食。全国解放以后，我们又办起合作社，实现了公社化，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。特别是从一九五八年以来，在总路线的指引下，依靠人民公社的集体力量，生产面貌发生了更大的变化。我们全大队修成了二百多亩水地、二百多亩水平梯田，粮食产量增长将近一倍，并且造了四百多亩经济林和用材林，村旁路旁，绿树成荫。还安装起电灯、电碾、电磨，贫下中农的生活越来越好。全国劳动人民没有不高兴的。邓拓一伙却站在地主、资产阶级的立场上，妄想为资本主义复辟开道。我们要正告你们，你们的鬼算盘打错了。什么是真善美，什么是假恶丑，我们心里亮堂堂的，绝不会上你们的当，受你们的骗。我们在党中央、毛主席的英明领导下，一定要坚决走社会主义道路，保卫社会主义江山，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    露出地面的毒草要拔，埋在地下的坏根要挖
    延安人民抱着对反党反社会主义分子的刻骨仇恨，决心锄草除根，把邓拓一伙及其幕后指使人统统挖出来，彻底打垮。延安八一敬老院的两位跟随毛主席参加过长征的老红军贺树山、魏青明，联名在《延安报》上发表文章。文章的题目是：《锄草必须锄根》。文章质问《前线》、《北京日报》和《北京晚报》：前几年，国内外阶级敌人大刮黑风，向党猖狂进攻，从你们的口里，也吐出了邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的毒水，这是谁的主意？邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的反党反社会主义罪行被一宗一宗地揭发了，你们又耍“牺牲车马，保存将帅”的把戏，这又是谁出的计谋？有贼就有王，有将就有帅，你们必须彻底交代。
    文章说：我们延安人有一句俗话：“锄草不除根，祸害在明春。”这也是我们几十年斗争的经验。我们要拿出象当年长征时那样的战斗精神，把一切反党反社会主义的毒草，连根带蔓统统拔掉。不管是露在地面的，还是埋在地下的，我们都要拔掉。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，我们有决心、有信心，在党中央、毛主席领导下，铲除这条反党反社会主义的黑线。
