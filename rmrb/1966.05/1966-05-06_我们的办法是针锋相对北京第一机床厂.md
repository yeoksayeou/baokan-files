    The *Jiefangjun Bao* (Liberation Army Daily)'s April 18th editorial sounded a loud clarion call and beat a heart-stirring war drum for the Socialist Cultural Revolution!

    Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belongs to a specific class and a specific political line." In the old society, landlords and capitalists held the seals of power, and the culture of that time served them. Today, our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have turned over politically and economically, and we must also make a great turnaround in culture. The Party and Chairman Mao have given us the iron hammer to smash the old world and create a new society, and also given us the revolutionary pen to oppose bourgeois ideology. People listen to the Party, and the pen listens to the people. We must actively participate in the Socialist Cultural Revolution, step forward bravely, and, like an iron hammer striking an anvil, completely eliminate the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line.

    Bourgeois spokesmen slander our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, falsely claiming that we are "intermediate figures" wavering between the socialist road and the capitalist road, advocating writing about "intermediate figures" to spread their doubts and wavering sentiments about socialism, and excluding worker-peasant-soldier heroes from the socialist literary and artistic stage. They say this is "deepening of realism," but we say this is not "deepening," but "uglification" -- uglifying workers, peasants, and soldiers, is "degeneration" -- degenerating socialist literature and art into bourgeois literature and art. We will never listen to their nonsense. Take our factory as an example, since studying Chairman Mao's works, the mental outlook of the worker comrades has been completely renewed. In this "Five-Good" general appraisal, more than one hundred "Five-Good" workers who creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, more than thirty advanced units, and several hundred single-item pacesetters were selected. This is the result of Mao Zedong Thought penetrating the hearts of the people, and this is Mao Zedong Thought transforming into a tremendous material force in us. Are such new people really "neither good nor bad, both good and bad" intermediate figures? Facts completely refuted the fallacy of the "theory of writing about 'intermediate figures'." There are more than just thousands upon thousands of such new people in real life. We only feel that literary and artistic works do not write enough about them, not deep enough, and not high enough. Our literature and art should describe them with the greatest enthusiasm and the most beautiful language, and sing their praises.

    After studying this editorial, we have a further understanding of the current class struggle situation, and also deeply feel our great responsibility. The worker comrades in our factory said: "What authority are Wu Han and others? They are authorities who speak up for and support right-leaning opportunists, and they are vanguards who use their pens as guns to attack the Party and socialism. Our struggle with them is not a simple academic discussion, but a sharp two-road struggle. We will never stop until we win!" Chairman Mao taught us: When the enemy holds something in his hand, we must investigate what he is holding and what use it is. Now we have investigated clearly that Wu Han, Tian Han, and others are holding anti-Party and anti-socialist things in their hands in order to achieve the goal of capitalist restoration. Our method is to be tit-for-tat, disarm them, replace them with our own guards, resolutely defend socialism, and firmly occupy the socialist cultural front!

    我们的办法是针锋相对北京第一机床厂
　  袁国梁
      《解放军报》四月十八日的社论，为社会主义文化大革命吹起了响亮的号声，擂起了震撼人心的战鼓！
    毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”旧社会里，地主资本家掌握了印把子，那时的文化是为他们服务的。今天，我们广大工农兵在政治上翻了身，在经济上翻了身，在文化上也要大翻身。党和毛主席给了我们砸碎旧世界、创造新社会的铁锤，也给了我们反对资产阶级思想的革命笔杆。人听党的话，笔听人的话。我们要积极参加社会主义文化大革命，挺身而上，象铁锤砸在铁砧子上一样，把反党反社会主义的黑线彻底搞掉。
    资产阶级代言人诬蔑我们广大的工农兵，胡说我们是动摇于社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的“中间人物”，提倡大写“中间人物”，以散布他们对社会主义的怀疑、动摇情绪，把工农兵的英雄人物排除出社会主义的文艺舞台。他们说这是“现实主义的深化”，我们说这不是“深化”，是“丑化”——丑化工农兵，是“蜕化”——把社会主义文艺蜕化成资产阶级文艺。我们决不听他们那一套。以我们厂来说吧，自从大学毛主席著作以后，工人同志的精神面貌焕然一新。这次“五好”总评，评出活学活用毛主席著作的“五好”工人一百多个，先进单位三十多个，单项标兵好几百个。这是毛泽东思想深入人心的结果，这是毛泽东思想在我们身上变成了巨大的物质力量。这样的新人，难道是“不好不坏、亦好亦坏”的中间人物么？事实完全驳倒了“写‘中间人物’论”的谬论。这样的新人，在现实生活中何止千千万万。我们只觉得文艺作品对他们写得还不够多，还不够深，还不够高。我们的文艺应当以最大的热情，最美的语言去描写他们，去歌颂他们。
    学习了这篇社论以后，我们对当前的阶级斗争形势有了进一步的认识，也深深感到自己责任重大。我们厂的工人同志说：“吴晗等人是什么权威？是为右倾机会主义分子说话撑腰的权威，是用笔杆当枪杆向党向社会主义进攻的急先锋。我们跟他的斗争，不是单纯的学术讨论，而是一场尖锐的两条道路的斗争。不取得胜利，我们誓不罢休！”毛主席教导我们：敌人手里拿着东西了，我们就要调查一下，他手里拿的是什么？有什么用处？现在我们调查清楚了，吴晗、田汉等人手里拿的是反党反社会主义的东西，为了达到资本主义复辟的目的。我们的办法是针锋相对，缴他们的械，换上我们自己的岗，坚决保卫社会主义，巩固地占领社会主义文化阵地！
