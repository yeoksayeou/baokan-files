    Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: Zheng Daiyu, an engineer of Anshan Electric Power Bureau and one of the creators of live-line work on ultra-high voltage power lines in China, recently delivered a report entitled "Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Combining with Workers and Taking the Road of Revolutionization" at the National Electric Power Industry Conference and the National Water Conservancy and Electric Power Political Work Conference, which was warmly welcomed.
    Chairman Mao said: "If intellectuals do not integrate with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing. The ultimate distinction between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, and counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." Zheng Daiyu followed Chairman Mao's teaching, consistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way for many years, insisting on close integration with the worker masses, and diligently transforming himself in labor, thus embarking on the road of revolutionization. In 1958, with the spirit of combining dauntless revolutionary spirit with scientific attitude, he successfully completed the experimental work of live-line maintenance on 220,000-volt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, making a significant contribution to ensuring the safe use of electricity in large industries. Through continuous summarization and improvement, live-line work has now formed a complete set of experiences and has been widely promoted throughout the country.
    Published here is a summary of Zheng Daiyu's report.

    In 1950, after graduating from Fujian Electrical Engineering College, I came to Anshan. At that time, under the cultivation and education of the Party organization, I had a passion for making progress and doing a good job, so I began to study Chairman Mao's works in 1952. However, my study at that time was still in an unconscious state.
    In 1956, I participated in the National Congress of Heroes. When the great leader Chairman Mao received us, I was so excited that tears streamed down my face, and I secretly resolved in my heart that all my future work must be done according to Chairman Mao's instructions. From then on, I began to read through the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" seriously. The more I studied, the more sweetness I tasted; the more I studied, the stronger my interest became. Especially in recent years, encouraged by the nationwide situation of studying Chairman Mao's works, I have finished reading Volumes I to IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and have repeatedly studied key articles. I often use "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" as my guide for work, use Comrades Bethune and Zhang Side as examples for my study, and take integrating with the worker masses as a practical action to transform myself.
    Now, I will report on how, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, I have combined with the worker masses and embarked on the road of revolutionization.
      Transforming the Subjective World and Tempering Oneself in Labor
    Although I was born into a blacksmith's family, most of my schooling took place in the old society. The influence of the old society left me with a lot of bourgeois individualism. After arriving at my work post, I regarded studying technology as my capital. My goal was to become an "engineer." To this end, I studied technical theory diligently, but I didn't think studying politics was so important, especially I didn’t have a clear understanding of the role of politics in technical work.
    Because politics was not in command, I lacked a sense of responsibility in my work, let alone any revolutionary fighting spirit. When encountering complex and difficult tasks, I often showed two attitudes: one was wanting to take the opportunity to show off; the other was being afraid of taking responsibility, being afraid of losing face, and being hesitant and afraid to step forward. For example, once the leadership gave me an urgent task: to be responsible for the surveying and designing of a section of 25-kilometer-long mountain transmission line. My initial attitude was to work on it for a while and show off my skills. But on second thought, no! Mountain transmission lines are different from those on flat ground, the terrain is complex, the position of the poles is difficult to determine, and the construction period is short and the requirements are urgent. If it is not done well, it will cause rework and waste, and I will be directly responsible. The more I thought about it, the more I felt unable to take responsibility! At that time, I said to the leader: "I am willing to go, but it is best not to ask me to be responsible." Although the leader told me some reasons, I was still unwilling to take responsibility. At that time, the leader pointed to several veteran workers next to me and said: "Old Zheng, these experienced veteran workers will go with you. If you combine well, you will definitely be able to complete the task." At this time, a veteran worker patted me on the shoulder and said: "Old Zheng, we are uneducated, but we have done the work. It doesn't matter, the task is very urgent. Even without surveying instruments, we have to complete it with our eyes! Besides, you can write and calculate, and you also have surveying instruments, so there will be no problem." These words from the worker comrades gave me a great shock. The workers were thinking about completing the task by all means, while I was thinking about being afraid of failing to complete the task, losing face, and being responsible if something went wrong. As a result, in actual work, thanks to the comrades' tireless work day and night, the task was finally completed on time. This was a great education for me.
    With the help of the Party organization, I studied the articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People". The noble qualities of Bethune and Comrade Zhang Side, who were selfless and dedicated to serving others, gave me great education. Chairman Mao said: "Our team is entirely for the purpose of liberating the people and works wholeheartedly for the interests of the people." And I wanted to specialize in a technique to become an engineer. Reading this, the more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. After thinking it over, the more I felt that my idea was wrong. Reading a passage in the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao said: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking and choosing, pushing the heavy burdens to others and choosing the light ones for themselves. When faced with something, they first think of themselves and then of others." These words were as if they were criticizing me, and my face was burning at the time. Under the enlightenment and education of Mao Zedong Thought, I slowly understood that an engineering and technical person must be clear that our work is for the revolution, to serve socialist construction. We must have revolutionary ambition and cannot mix individualism into our minds. If this is not clear, when encountering difficulties and arduous tasks, we cannot use the requirements of a "revolutionary" to spur ourselves on, and we cannot give ourselves great confidence and courage.
    Studying articles such as "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" gave me a further understanding of going deep into the field and integrating with the worker masses. Chairman Mao taught us in the article: "However, if intellectuals do not integrate with the workers and peasants, they will accomplish nothing." Reading this, my mood was particularly heavy, because my original idea was exactly the opposite of what Chairman Mao said. I thought that studying for a few more years was to enable myself to do some easy work in the office, study technical theory, not participate in physical labor, and that workers are for doing work, so whether or not to integrate with workers is not a big issue. This is actually the exploiting class ideology of the old society, "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior."
    Later, I began to change this wrong idea and often went to the site to participate in some physical labor, carrying tools, digging pits, erecting poles, and pushing capstans with the workers. Although I participated in some physical labor, my ideological understanding was not so profound, and I had not yet recognized this as a height such as "revolution or non-revolution." I merely thought that I had gained some experience in learning and mastering some practical operating techniques. However, the leaders and worker comrades were so kind to me. They encouraged me and said, "You are doing the right thing. This way, you can become one with the workers...."
    What is the right thing to do? I didn't understand it ideologically. I asked Chairman Mao's works for guidance with this question.
    After studying "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art", I found that my idea had problems. Chairman Mao said in the article "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party": "Before intellectuals are integrated into the revolutionary struggle of the masses, and before they are determined to serve the interests of the masses and combine with the masses, they often have tendencies towards subjectivism and individualism, their thinking is often empty, and their actions are often wavering." Chairman Mao's teachings awakened me. Through comparison and examination, I found the root cause of my ideological problems, that is, individualism was at play. I had not made up my mind to transform my thinking, and my old thoughts and feelings had not been completely changed, so I felt empty in my thoughts and wavered in labor. Chairman Mao said: "If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to become one with the masses, you must make up your mind and undergo long and even painful tempering." I also found the power to correct my wrong thoughts here, which made me take a leap forward in my ideological understanding. I deeply felt that intellectuals have two major weaknesses: one is the bourgeois individualistic idea of fame and gain that is unwilling to easily give way, it is like a ball thrown into the water, when pressed down with your hand, it goes down, and when you let go, it floats up again; the other is that they understand the principles quickly, but there is a big gap in action. The two major weaknesses of intellectuals were fully exposed in myself. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with generally understanding the principles, but more importantly, we must make up our minds, completely overcome bourgeois individualistic thinking, and put it into action. After further understanding these, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings, made up my mind, went to labor to temper myself, especially for those more arduous labors, such as high-altitude operations, night patrols, etc., I did not miss any opportunity to actively participate.
    High-altitude operations were not so simple for me at first. When I first climbed the iron tower, my legs trembled straight and I dared not climb up. The worker comrades encouraged me from below to keep climbing up and not look down. In this way, through slow exercise, I was finally able to climb a 42-meter-high iron tower. Wiping porcelain insulator strings on the iron tower seems very simple, but it is not so easy. The porcelain insulator string is more than three meters long, and people climb down from the upper end of the porcelain insulator string and sit on the wire. Not to mention that you have to work with both hands, just holding the porcelain insulator string without moving will make your head dizzy. The first time I climbed the iron tower to wipe the porcelain insulator string, I sat on the wire with my buttocks, my legs wandered around, and I held the porcelain insulator string tightly with both hands and dared not move. The worker comrade shouted to me: "Old Zheng! If you don't let go of your hands, how can you work?" I shouted to the worker comrade: "It's not that I don't want to let go of my hands, it's that my buttocks can't sit still!" Later, the veteran worker taught me to hook my legs on the wire so that my legs and feet were working hard. So, I sat firmly and could slowly let go of one hand to work. Later, I often insisted on diligent study and hard practice and treated it as a test of my will. Especially when encountering 60 to 70-meter-high iron towers, I used this new difficult condition to temper myself, even if I couldn't climb up in one breath, I would try my best to climb up in several times.
    In arduous labors such as high-altitude operations and night patrols, whenever I felt physically and mentally unbearable, I would grit my teeth and persevere when I thought of Chairman Mao's words "…painful tempering". These occasions fully expose the weaknesses of us intellectuals, but as long as we persist for a long time, we will be tempered stronger and stronger each time.
    Living with the worker masses, working together, over time, and with more tempering, not only strengthens the will, but more importantly, gradually enables oneself to love what the worker masses love, hate what the worker masses hate, endure the hardships that the worker masses endure, and constantly wash away the non-proletarian things on oneself. In terms of position, ideology, and emotion, I began to become one with the worker masses. Wearing work clothes and carrying pliers and screwdrivers on my waist did not make me feel out of place, but felt very glorious. On the contrary, seeing those intellectuals who are unwilling to work, dress beautifully, and talk about empty theories, I feel disgusted.
    Putting Down the Airs, Learning from the Workers, and Serving the Masses
    The process of integrating with the worker masses is not only a process of ideological transformation, but also a process of combining theory with practice. Studying "On Practice" made my understanding clearer. Chairman Mao made a profound and scientific analysis of the relationship between human knowledge and practice, and the relationship between knowing and doing. This analysis made me understand more clearly and systematically that correct human knowledge must be built on the basis of practice. Therefore, in my work, I paid attention to learning the practical operating skills of the worker comrades to improve myself. In the past, I always thought that line patrolling was a relatively easy and simple job with no technical content. I participated in line patrolling and walked with worker comrades for a day, and my neck was very sore, but I didn't find any defects. Once, a worker comrade told me the location of a gunshot wound on the wire, but it took me a long time to find it. Another time, a synchronous condenser was to be overhauled in a substation. When disassembling it, there were two wedge strips made of special steel on the rotor magnetic pole, which were long and thin, more than two meters in length and, one end ten millimeters thick and the other end five millimeters thick. If you pull it out from one end, it may break; if you hit it from one end, it may become bald. At that time, an engineer ran to Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, Shenyang and many other places and consulted some engineers, but no one could find a solution. The construction period was delayed for several months. Some engineers calculated and said: "This thing cannot be taken out by calculation, and it may not have been intended to be taken out when it was manufactured." However, later, Li Wanxin, an engineer who came from an old worker, through technical collaboration activities, together with several engineers from other factories with rich experience who came from old workers, after pondering on the spot, used an oil press and a combination of jacking, knocking, and pulling methods to solve the problem in only more than 40 minutes. This gave me a profound education and made me realize that some old workers do have a wealth of experience and unique skills that cannot be found in books.
    Many facts made me deeply aware of the practical experience of the workers. With the help of worker comrades and in constant practice, I gradually mastered some basic practical operating skills. Because I went deep into reality more often, I would encounter many big and small problems in production. Solving a small problem would accumulate an experience, and solving many small problems would improve a lot of understanding and accumulate a lot of experience. With more experience, it may be possible to solve some medium or large problems in the future. In the past, I stayed in the office and didn’t go down, looked down on small problems, and didn’t dare to deal with big problems. In recent years, the reason why I have been able to constantly generate ideas and requirements for technological innovation in my mind and realize some projects with worker comrades is because production practice has accumulated production practice problems in my mind, as well as sensual materials that have undergone some ideological processing. Without this, it is impossible to correctly think of technological innovation problems. Some people say: "It is not worth the loss for technical personnel to participate in labor," "Moving your brain in the house and doing a few studies to improve efficiency dozens of times is equivalent to laboring for a lifetime." This argument is wrong because it violates the epistemology of dialectical materialism. Chairman Mao taught us in the article "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?": "A correct understanding often needs to go through many repetitions from matter to spirit, from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to understanding, from understanding to practice, before it can be completed. This is the Marxist epistemology, the dialectical materialist epistemology."
    In the process of learning from the worker masses, it was not without some twists and turns. When I first went down, I felt very uncomfortable. At that time, instead of checking my stinky airs, I felt that the workers were very cold to me, so I was very depressed. In the end, I was enlightened and educated from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "…Without full enthusiasm, without the determination to look downwards, without the desire for knowledge, without the spirit of putting down stinky airs and becoming a willing pupil, it is certainly impossible to do it, and it will certainly not be done well. It must be understood that the masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous. If we don’t understand this, we cannot get the basic knowledge.” Chairman Mao’s teachings made me see my problems clearly and realize that the problem still lies in myself. Although I had the desire, I lacked full enthusiasm and had not sincerely learned from the worker masses. Although I went deep down, I did not completely put down my stinky airs. In this way, how dare the worker masses pay attention to you? How can they be willing to pay attention to you? After that, I began to change my style and paid attention to starting from some small actions. When participating in repairs with the workers, I helped load and unload trucks, carry tools, boil water, and cook food. I scrambled to do any odd jobs.
    After I did this, the relationship between the worker masses and me gradually became closer. Once, in the severe winter, when I was taking an open car to the line in the wild, the veteran worker was afraid that I was wearing too little, so he unbuttoned his cotton coat and put half of it on me, and another veteran worker also unbuttoned his and put half of it on me, wrapping me tightly in the middle of them. At this time, I was more warmed in my heart than on my body. Another time, when I was sick, some workers came to care for me, and some workers would rather not eat themselves and brought me dumplings. Especially when I had problems and difficulties in my work, they stretched out their strong arms to help me solve problems and overcome difficulties. Once, in a project to increase the height of an iron tower by four meters, due to my own negligence, the iron tower was not assembled tightly by seventy to eighty millimeters, which scared me! That day, I couldn't even eat dinner when I went back. I thought that to dismantle the iron frame and re-lay the foundation would not only be rework and waste, but more importantly, it would delay the power transmission time and directly affect the electricity use of industries and residents in several cities. How could this be! At this time, veteran worker Master Hu came to comfort me and said: "It doesn't matter, just learn from the lessons in the future." After arriving at the scene, he consulted with several veteran workers and adopted a method of local adjustment, which quickly solved the problem. These vivid facts moved me, educated me, and also made me deeply feel that an engineering and technical person can only have strength when living among the worker masses, and it is the greatest happiness to be trusted by the worker masses. Over time, I not only learned a lot of production practice knowledge, but also established a deep relationship with the worker masses.
    In the struggle of going deep into practice and participating in production, it is certainly important to learn the rich technical experience from the worker masses, but more important is to learn the noble ideological qualities of the working class. I once experienced such a thing that I still find unforgettable. That time, I participated in the joint overhaul of an ultra-high-voltage line. At that time, our overhaul section encountered a rainstorm and flash floods broke out. Judging from the situation, the task was very difficult to complete, but at this critical moment, a veteran worker said loudly to everyone: "Comrades! In this situation, we must think of the entire line and cannot abandon this section and affect the power supply of the entire line…." Later, under the leadership of several veteran workers, they continued to work. The comrades held hands and broke through the barrier of flash floods and completed the overhaul task on time. After the operation was completed, it was also necessary to cross a flash flood to contact the headquarters, which was also an arduous task. However, because of the performance of several veteran workers in the face of difficulties, I was really moved, so Comrade Li Dehan and I bravely broke through the barrier of flash floods and completed the contact task. Afterwards, several veteran workers such as Tang Guoqiang did not mention themselves at all, but praised us at the meeting. At this time, my eyes were a little wet with excitement and said: "Comrades! How can you praise us! This is all because of your actions that brought me courage….” In this way, from the rush repair in the rain and thunder at night, from the high-altitude operations in the severe cold, from the trekking line patrols in climbing mountains and wading through water, I saw the organized, disciplined, selfless, and fearless spirit of the working class. All of these also deeply educated me.
    Through so many vivid examples, I further realized that for an engineering and technical person to learn from workers and serve workers in production practice is not only a process of combining theory with practice, but more importantly, it is a process of self-transformation. An engineering and technical person can only play a role in production if he masters the technical experience gained through practice. However, while learning technical experience from the worker masses, self-transformation must be given top priority, otherwise, it will be difficult to implement everything else.
        Dare to Struggle, Dare to Win
    Many facts have taught me that only with correct ideas can we dare to practice and dare to innovate.
    I also took some detours in the process of technological innovation. At first, the purpose of technological innovation was not clear, and I mistakenly regarded it as a personal matter. Therefore, even if I did some small innovations, I could not complete them for a long time because I did not have a lofty purpose as a driving force. This was the case when I was researching the live-line porcelain insulator cleaner in 1953, and it took me more than two years to make just one tool. What was the reason? The most fundamental reason was that individualistic ideas of fame and gain often came out to cause trouble. First, I kept it secret, afraid of losing face if I failed; when things went smoothly, I would work on it for a while, and when I encountered difficulties, I would throw it aside. It was not until 1955 that I accepted the patient education of the Party organization and with the support of the masses that I completed it. This matter gave me a great lesson.
    In 1956, I gloriously joined the Communist Party of China, and my determination to fight for communism became clearer, and my enthusiasm for working for the revolution became stronger. When encountering difficulties, I would think of Chairman Mao's teachings and my own aspirations, which would generate great courage and strength and give me the confidence and determination to overcome difficulties. Once, when I was doing an experiment to promote the 44,000-volt live-line water flushing porcelain insulator, I accidentally caused a short circuit accident. At this time, I was timid and hesitant and dared not promote it any more. But then I thought: This is not right. Chairman Mao often teaches us that the more difficult it is, the more courage we should have to overcome difficulties. Am I frightened by this accident? Thinking of this, I mustered up my courage and decided to persevere. With this requirement in my heart, my fighting spirit was also enhanced, and I quickly learned a lesson from the failure, and with the cooperation of various units, I boldly conducted experiments on 220,000-volt equipment.
    After the equipotential operation was successfully tested at the Central Laboratory of the Former Northeast Electric Power Administration, I participated in the experimental work of promoting 220,000-volt equipotential operation. At the beginning, I also thought about many problems, such as 110 volts to 220 volts of electricity can electrocute people, and 220,000 volts is 1,000 to 2,000 times higher, so there can be no ambiguity! At that time, other comrades also had many concerns. Some people said: "220,000 volts, the voltage is so high, the corona of the wire is so large that birds dare not land on it. Can it work to touch it with the human body? The human body has resistance, and when it comes into contact with a 220,000-volt live body, a potential difference will be generated, and sparks will come out with any movement! It is not good if the person's body is dirty, it is not good to have sweat, this is easy to spark….” Some people also said: "Will it kill red blood cells and white blood cells? Will it affect nerves and fertility? The principle of equipotential is known abroad, but some scientifically developed countries do not do it, there must be some problems in it!" I thought, if foreigners don't do it, we Chinese people must do it. Chinese people should have the backbone to do their own scientific experiments and come up with their own scientific results. We must not only destroy an old world, but also be able to build a new world. Whether it works or not, whether it can be done or not, in addition to theoretical analysis, we have to test it with practice. "If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch the tiger cubs?" I am a Communist Party member, and at this critical moment, I should step forward! So, I submitted an experimental application to the leadership.
    The Party committee agreed to my application, but for the sake of prudence, the leadership instructed me to further do a scientific analysis and first do animal experiments. So, we first found a rabbit, put it in a cage, hung it in the air, and then applied voltage to the rabbit. When the voltage rose to 100,000 volts, the rabbit's body trembled a little. When it rose to 180,000 volts, the rabbit's ears drooped down. Then, when it rose to 220,000 volts, there was no new change. After the power was turned off, the rabbit's spirit returned to normal. So, why did the rabbit tremble and why did its ears droop? Our analysis believed that the trembling was mainly because the sound of the discharge was too loud when the voltage rose to 100,000 volts, and the rabbit was a little scared; the ears drooped because the rabbit's ears were long and generated tip discharge. These are normal phenomena. Later, the leadership agreed to start human experiments.
    On the first night of the experiment, my mood was very uneasy, and I thought about many problems. Late at night, the whole family was asleep, but I was still tossing and turning and couldn't sleep. The thought of an accident was still rippling in my mind…. However, when I thought that the power outage operation would force thousands of employees in many factories and mines to stop production, which would directly affect socialist construction; thinking that I am a Communist Party member, and the application I wrote when I joined the Party said: Dedicate everything to the Party, dedicate everything to communism, and if necessary, I can dedicate my life; thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings: "There will be sacrifices if you struggle…", "To die for the interests of the people is heavier than Mount Tai," I was inspired and added to my courage and strength. I thought, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang and many revolutionary martyrs, they knew that they were going to sacrifice, but they were able to rush forward without hesitation. Moreover, our experiment has sufficient scientific basis, and for socialist construction, for the uninterrupted production of factories and mines, we should be calm and calm, have courage, and have the spirit of not being afraid of self-sacrifice. The next day, I participated in the experimental work with full spirit and without any timidity. When I walked into the tightly arranged laboratory, the worker comrades kindly asked how I had rested. The leading comrades also personally helped me put on the metal wire woven coat. When I climbed onto the experimental cage, I felt a little nervous, mainly because I lacked practical experience with the 220,000-volt voltage, so I tried to calm myself down. The most tense moment was the moment when the switch was about to be closed and the power had not yet been turned on. With a "pa da" sound, the high-voltage switch was closed. The engineer on the operating table shouted out the sounds of 10,000, 20,000, 40,000… until 60,000, when I breathed a sigh of relief. I thought, the situation is good, it doesn't matter, if something happened, it would have been over long ago. After I gained direct sensory experience, I had more confidence. When the voltage rose to 100,000 volts, the comrades below shouted: "Old Zheng, there are sparks on your hat!" I was startled at first, but immediately thought that the most important thing at this time is to be calm. I thought about it carefully, this may be because a small copper wire end came out and caused a tip discharge phenomenon, so I pressed it with my hand, and sure enough, the spark disappeared. When the voltage rose to 180,000 volts, the eyebrows and hair on the face stood up, and there was an airflow phenomenon on the nose. Because I had already grasped the practical experience, I was no longer nervous, and I immediately analyzed that this was a normal phenomenon of tip discharge. At this time, I asked the commander-in-chief: "Can I do a shielding experiment on the airflow phenomenon on the tip of the nose?" The commander-in-chief nodded in agreement. So, I shielded it with my hand, and it disappeared when shielded, and it appeared again when I released it, which proved that our judgment was correct. Insist on continuing to boost the voltage until 220,000 volts, I took off my gloves and did some simple operations on the wire. Everything achieved the desired effect. After the experiment was completed, I walked out of the metal cage in the applause and cheers of the masses. When the leading comrades shook hands with me cordially, my eyes filled with tears of excitement. Later, various operating experiments were successfully carried out on the bus bar of the substation and on the 42-meter-high transmission line. In this way, together with the worker masses, I did a job that I should do for the Party and the people.
    Many facts have made me deeply realize that only by paying attention to exercising ourselves in arduous labor in peacetime and paying attention to cultivating our will can we step forward in times of difficulty. Otherwise, that kind of "courage" has no solid foundation. Therefore, we must insist on combining with the worker masses, tempering ourselves in arduous labor for a long time, learning from the workers in production practice for a long time, demanding ourselves with the standards of a revolutionary everywhere, and serving the people wholeheartedly, only in this way can we make contributions to production.
    The rapid development of live-line work technology in recent years fully demonstrates that the main factor in production is the worker masses. Facts tell us that only the worker masses can continuously sum up experience and continuously innovate tools and improve operating methods in thousands of operations and practices. Up to now, more than 1,040 pieces of live-line work tools have been created successively, and live-line maintenance has basically been realized on transmission, transformation, and distribution equipment, and the tools have reached a new level of lightness. Compared with the United States and Japan, some items have lighter tools, fewer maintenance personnel, and shorter maintenance time. These achievements are the creations of the worker masses, and I have only played a little role that a technician should play.
    The practice of the past few years has made me deeply realize that an engineering and technical person must study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their own thinking in order to take the road of revolutionization. At the same time, they must combine with the worker masses and persist in labor training in order to become one with the workers, learn the ideological feelings and production practice experience of the working class, and make the knowledge they have learned play a role.
    I deeply realize that only with Mao Zedong Thought can I constantly overcome the remaining individualistic selfish thoughts in my mind and truly learn the skills to serve the people. In the past few years, although I have paid attention to studying Chairman Mao's works and initially understood the truth of combining with the worker masses, it can only be said that it is just the beginning. In the future, I will definitely work harder to study Chairman Mao's works, arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, better combine with the worker and peasant masses, and be a veritable intellectual of the working class.

    在毛泽东思想指引下，同工人结合走革命化道路
    鞍山电业局工程师郑代雨在全国电力工业会议和全国水利电力政治工作会议上的报告摘要
    新华社三十日讯　我国超高压电线带电作业创造者之一，鞍山电业局工程师郑代雨，最近在北京召开的全国电力工业会议上和全国水利电力政治工作会议上作了题为《在毛泽东思想指引下，同工人结合走革命化道路》的报告，受到人们的热烈欢迎。
    毛主席说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”郑代雨遵循毛主席这一教导，长年坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚持同工人群众紧密结合，在劳动中认真刻苦地改造自己，因而走上了革命化的道路。一九五八年他以大无畏革命气概同科学态度相结合的精神，在二十二万伏超高压输电线路上成功地完成了带电检修作业的试验工作，为保证大工业的安全用电作出了重大贡献。经过不断总结提高，现在带电作业已经形成了一套完整的经验，在全国普遍推广。
    这里发表的是郑代雨的报告摘要。
    一九五○年，我在福建电机专科学校毕业以后便来到鞍山。当时，在党组织的培养教育下，自己有一股想进步、想搞好工作的热情，所以从一九五二年就开始学习毛主席著作。不过，那时的学习还处在不自觉的状态。
    一九五六年，我参加了全国群英会。当伟大领袖毛主席接见我们的时候，我激动得热泪直流，心里暗自下定决心，今后的一切工作，一定照着毛主席的指示去做。从那时起，我开始认真地通读了《毛泽东选集》。越学，尝到的甜头越多；越学，学的兴致越浓。特别是近几年来，在全国大学毛主席著作的形势的鼓舞下，我读完了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，并对重点文章反复地学，不断地学，我经常以《实践论》、《矛盾论》作为自己工作的指南，以白求恩、张思德同志作为自己学习的榜样，以同工人群众相结合作为改造自己的实际行动。
    现在汇报一下我是怎样在毛泽东思想指引下，同工人群众结合走革命化的道路的。
      改造主观世界，在劳动中磨练自己
    我虽然出生在一个铁匠家里，但是我的念书时间大多是在旧社会里度过的。旧社会的影响使我沾染了不少资产阶级的个人主义思想。到工作岗位以后，就把钻研技术做为自己的本钱。自己的奋斗目标是“工程师”。为此，起早贪黑地学习技术理论，而对学习政治呢，觉得不是那么重要，特别是对政治在技术工作中的作用也认识不清。
    由于政治不挂帅，工作就没有责任心，更不用说什么革命斗志。遇到复杂和困难任务的时候，往往出现两种态度：一种是想趁机会显示一下自己；另一种是怕负责任，怕丢面子，畏首畏尾，不敢挺身而出。比如，有一次领导上给我一项紧急任务：让我负责一段二十五公里长的山区输电线路的测量和设计工作。开始的态度是，想干它一阵，显示一下自己的技术。但一细想，不行啊！山区输电线路同平地的不一样，地形复杂，电杆位置不好定，并且工期短，要求急，如弄不好，就会造成返工浪费，自己就要负直接责任。越想越觉得不能负责！当时，我对领导说：“要我去，我还是愿意去的，但最好不要叫我负责。”领导上虽然和我说了一些道理，自己还是不肯负责。当时领导指着旁边的几位老师傅对我说：“老郑啊，这几位有经验的老师傅同你一起去，你们好好结合，一定能完成任务。”这时，一位老师傅拍着我的肩膀说：“老郑，我们是没有文化的，但是活是干过的，不要紧，任务很急，就是没有测量仪器，我们凭眼睛看也得把它干下来！何况有你能写会算，还有测量仪器，所以更不会有问题。”工人同志这些话，给我很大震动，工人想的是用一切办法完成任务，而我想的是怕完不成任务丢面子，怕出问题负责任。结果，在实际工作中，由于同志们不分白天黑夜的紧张劳动，终于按时完成了任务。这一次对我的教育很大。
    在党组织的帮助下，我学习了《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》这两篇文章。白求恩和张思德同志的那种毫不利己、专门利人的高贵品质，给了我极大的教育。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”而我呢，想专一套技术，做为当工程师的本钱。读到这里，越想越惭愧，思前想后，越觉得自己的想法不对头。读到《纪念白求恩》文章中的一段话，毛主席说：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”这些话就好象批评我一样，当时自己脸上火辣辣的。在毛泽东思想的启发教育下，我慢慢懂得了，一个工程技术人员必须明确我们的工作是为革命而干的，是为社会主义建设服务的。要有革命的雄心壮志，不能在头脑中掺杂着个人主义的东西，不明确这一点，在碰到困难和艰巨任务的时候，就不能用“革命者”的要求来鞭策自己，就不能使自己有巨大的信心和勇气。
    学习了《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》等文章，使我对深入现场劳动和工人群众相结合，有了进一步认识。毛主席在文章中教导我们：“然而知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”读到这儿，我的心情特别沉重，因为自己原来的想法正和毛主席讲的相反。认为多念了几年书，就是想使自己能在办公室里干些轻松的工作，钻研技术理论，不参加体力劳动，而工人是干活的，同工人结合不结合问题不大。这实际就是旧社会“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的剥削阶级思想。
    以后，开始转变了这种错误思想，经常到现场去参加一些体力劳动，同工人一起扛工具、挖坑、立杆、推绞磨。虽然参加了一些体力劳动，但在思想认识上还不是那么深刻，还没有提高到这是“革命与不革命”的那样高度来认识，仅仅认为只是在学习掌握一些实际操作技术上有了些体会。但是，领导和工人同志们对我却是那样的亲切，他们鼓励我说：“你这样做对了，这样才能和工人打成一片……。”
    究竟怎样做才是对的呢？思想上并没有通。我就带着这个问题，向毛主席著作请教。
    我学了《中国革命和中国共产党》和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》之后，发现自己的想法有毛病。毛主席在《中国革命和中国共产党》这篇文章里说：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”毛主席的教导使我清醒过来。通过对照检查，我找到了自己思想问题的根本原因，那就是个人主义思想在作怪，没有下决心改造思想，自己旧的思想感情还未彻底改变，所以在自己思想上感到空虚，在劳动中发生动摇。毛主席说：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”我又从这里找到了改正错误思想的力量，这就使我在思想认识上有了飞跃。我深深觉得，知识分子有两大弱点：一个是不肯轻易让位的资产阶级个人名利思想，它好象扔进水里的皮球一样，用手一按，下去了，一松手，它又漂了上来；一个是道理领会的快，但一行动，却有很大的差距。知识分子的这两大弱点，在我自己身上都充分地暴露了出来。因此，不能满足于一般的领会道理，更重要的是痛下决心，彻底克服资产阶级个人主义思想，付诸于行动。进一步认识了这些之后，我就按照毛主席的教导，痛下决心，到劳动中去磨练自己，尤其对那些比较艰苦的劳动，如高空作业、夜间巡线等，我都不放过机会去积极参加。
    高空作业对我来说，起初也不是那么简单的事。开始上铁塔的时候，腿就直打哆嗦，不敢往上爬。工人同志们在下边给我壮胆，鼓励我一直往上爬，眼睛不要往下看。就这样，我通过慢慢锻炼，终于能上四十二米高的铁塔了。上铁塔擦瓷瓶串，看起来很简单，其实也不是那么容易。那瓷瓶串，有三米来长，人从瓷瓶串上端爬下来坐在导线上，别说两只手还得干活，就是抱着瓷瓶串不动，头都发晕。我第一次上铁塔擦瓷瓶串的时候，屁股坐在导线上，两只腿乱游荡，两只手紧抱着瓷瓶串一动也不敢动。工人同志就对我喊：“老郑啊！你两只手不放开，那怎么能干活呀？”我就对工人同志喊：“不是我不愿放开手，是屁股坐不住啊！”后来，老师傅就叫我把腿别在导线上，使我的腿和脚都用上了劲。于是，我就坐稳当了，慢慢也可以放开一只手干活了。以后，我经常坚持勤学苦练，并把它当作考验自己的意志来对待。特别是遇到六十到七十米高的铁塔时，我就以这个新的困难条件来磨练自己，即使一口气爬不上去，也要竭尽全力分几次爬上去。
    在高空作业、夜间巡线等艰苦劳动中，每当我在精神和肉体上感到难以忍耐时，一想起毛主席所说的“……痛苦的磨练”那句话，我就咬紧牙关坚持下来。在这些场合里，充分暴露出我们知识分子的软弱性，但只要长此坚持下去，就会一次比一次锻炼得更加坚强。
    同工人群众生活在一起，劳动在一起，时间长了，磨练的次数多了，不但锻炼了意志，更主要的是使自己逐步做到了爱工人群众之所爱，恨工人群众之所恨，吃得工人群众所吃的苦，不断地洗刷自己身上非无产阶级的东西。在立场、思想、感情各个方面，开始同工人群众打成了一片。对自己穿上作业服，腰里别着钳子、螺丝刀去干活，不是感到不象样子了，而是感到很光荣了。相反地，看到那些不愿意劳动，穿得漂漂亮亮，满口空谈理论的知识分子，却感到叫人厌恶了。
    放下架子，向工人学习，为群众服务
    同工人群众相结合的过程，不仅是思想改造的过程，也是理论联系实际的过程。学习了《实践论》，使我认识更加明确了。毛主席把人类的认识和实践的关系，把知和行的关系作了精辟的、科学的分析。这个分析使我更清楚地、更系统地懂得，人类的正确认识必须建筑在实践的基础上。因此，我在劳动中就注意了学习工人同志的实际操作技术，来提高自己。过去，我总以为巡线是比较轻便和简单的工作，没有什么技术性。自己参加了巡线，跟工人同志走了一天，脖子累得很痛，但什么缺陷也没有发现。有一次，工人同志告诉了我导线枪伤的位置，而我却找了很长时间才找到。另一次，在一个变电所内要大修一台调相机，分解的时候，转子磁极上有两片用特殊钢材做的楔条，又长又薄，长度有两米多，厚度是，一头十毫米，另一头五毫米。如果从一端向外拔，就可能拔断；如果从一头打，就可能打秃。当时，有一位工程师跑到北京、天津、哈尔滨、沈阳等好多地方，也请教过一些工程师，但都没有找到解决的办法，工期拖延了好几个月。有的工程师经过计算说：“这玩意儿，通过计算是不能拿出来的，可能制造的时候就没有想拿出来。”可是，后来老工人出身的李万新工程师，通过技术串联活动，同其他工厂几位有丰富经验的老工人出身的工程师一道，在现场琢磨以后，用一台油压机，采用顶、敲、拔的联合方法，只用了四十多分钟，就把问题解决了。这给了我深刻的教育，认识到在一些老工人身上，确实蕴藏着很多从书本上无法找到的丰富经验和绝招。
    许多事实使我对工人的实际经验有了深刻认识。在工人同志的帮助下，在不断的实践中，使我逐步掌握了一些基本的实际操作技术。由于深入实际多了，在生产上就会遇到许许多多的大小问题，解决了一个小问题，就积累了一条经验，解决了许多小问题，就提高了不少认识，并积累了许多经验。由于经验多了，以后就可能解决一些中问题或大问题。过去在办公室里不下去，对小问题看不起，大问题不敢理。近几年来，我所以能在脑子里不断产生革新技术的思想和要求，并同工人同志一起实现了一些项目，是因为在生产实践中，使我脑子里积累了生产实践的问题，以及经过一番思想加工的感性材料。没有这一点，是不可能正确地想出革新技术的问题的。有的人说：“技术人员参加劳动，得不偿失”，“在屋里脑子一动，搞几项研究，提高效率几十倍，就等于劳动一辈子”。这种论点是错误的，因为它是违背辩证唯物论的认识论的。毛主席在《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》一文中教导我们说：“一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。这就是马克思主义的认识论，就是辩证唯物论的认识论。”
    我向工人群众学习的过程中，也不是没有一点波折的。最初下去的时候，觉得很不习惯，当时，自己不去检查自己的臭架子，反而感到工人对我很冷淡，于是自己思想很苦闷。最后，还是从毛主席著作中得到了启发和教育，毛主席说：“……没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。必须明白：群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”毛主席的教导，使我看清了自己的毛病，认识到问题仍然是出在自己的身上。自己虽然有愿望，但缺乏满腔的热忱，还没有真心诚意地向工人群众学习。自己虽然深入下去了，但没有彻底放下臭架子。这样，工人群众怎么敢答理你呢？怎么能愿意答理你呢？此后，我开始转变了作风，注意了从一些细小的行动做起。在同工人一块参加检修的时候，就帮助装车卸车，搬运工具、烧水做饭，不管什么零活，我都抢着干。
    我这样做了之后，工人群众同我的关系就渐渐地密切起来了。有一次，在严寒的“三九”天，坐敞篷汽车去野外的线路上时，老师傅怕我穿的少，就把棉大衣解开给我披上一半，另一位老师傅也解开给我披上一半，把我紧紧地包在他们中间。这时候，我与其说是暖在身上，倒不如说是暖在心里了。还有一次我病了，一些工人都来问寒问暖，有的工人宁肯自己不吃，把饺子给我端来了。特别是在我工作上有问题和困难的时候，他们更是伸出有力的臂膀，帮助我解决问题，战胜困难。有一次，在一项铁塔加高四米的工程中，由于自己的工作疏忽，在铁塔组装时，差七十到八十毫米宽合不上，这可把我吓坏了！那天，回去饭也吃不下去了。我想，要把铁架子拆下来，重新打基础，不只是返工浪费，更重要的是拖长了送电时间，直接影响了几个市的工矿和居民用电，那怎么得了！就在这时候，老工人胡师傅来安慰我说：“不要紧，以后吸取教训就是了。”到现场后，他找了几个老师傅一商量，采用了一种局部调整的办法，很快就解决了问题。这些生动的事实，感动了我，教育了我，同时也使我深深地感到：一个工程技术人员，只有生活在工人群众中间，才有力量，只有得到工人群众的信任，才是莫大的幸福。就这样天长日久，我不仅学到了不少的生产实践知识，还同工人群众建立了深厚的感情。
    在深入实际参加生产实践的斗争中，向工人群众学习丰富的技术经验固然重要，但更重要的是学习工人阶级的高贵思想品质。我曾经历了这样一件事，直到现在还使我难以忘怀。那一次，我参加一条超高压线路的联合检修，当时在我们检修段内遇到暴风雨，暴发了山洪。看情况，任务是很难完成了，但就在这紧急的时刻，一位老工人对大家高声说：“同志们！在这种情况下，我们要想到全条线路，不能扔下这一段而影响全线送电……。”后来，就在几位老工人的带动下继续干起来了，同志们手拉着手，冲破了山洪阻挡，按时完成了检修任务。作业完成后，还需要穿过一道山洪向指挥部联系，这也是一项艰巨的任务，但由于几位老工人在困难面前的表现，实在使我感动，我便和李德涵同志奋勇的冲过山洪阻挡，完成了联系任务。事后，唐国强等几位老工人只字不提自己，却在会上表扬了我们。这时，我激动得两眼有些湿润了，说：“同志们！怎么能表扬呀！这都是因为你们的行动，才给我带来了勇气……。”就这样，从夜间雷雨中的抢修，从严寒中的高空作业，从爬山涉水中的徒步巡线，都使我看到了工人阶级有组织、有纪律、大公无私、英勇无畏的精神面貌。所有这些也都使我深深地受到了教育。
    通过这样许多生动事例，使我进一步体会到：一个工程技术人员，在生产实践中向工人学习，为工人服务，不仅是一个理论联系实际的过程，更为重要的是进行自我改造的过程。一个工程技术人员，只有把经过实践的技术经验掌握在手里，才能在生产上发挥作用。然而，在向工人群众学习技术经验的同时，还必须把自我改造放在首位，否则，其它一切就很难付诸实现。
        勇于斗争，敢于胜利
    许多事实教育了我，必须有正确的思想，才能勇于实践，才能敢于革新创造。
    我在搞技术革新的过程中，也是走过一些弯路的。最初对技术革新的目的不明确，错误地把它看作是个人的事情。因此，即使搞些小革新，也因为没有崇高的目的作动力，而迟迟地搞不成。我在一九五三年研究带电瓷瓶扫除器的时候，就是这样，仅一件工具就拖了两年多的时间。什么原因呢？最根本的原因是，个人主义名利思想还常常出来作怪。先是闷着不说，怕搞不成丢面子；顺利的时候，就搞它一阵，碰到困难的时候，就将它扔到一边。直到一九五五年，我接受了党组织的耐心教育，并在群众的支持下才搞成了，这件事给了我很大的教训。
    一九五六年，我光荣的参加了中国共产党，为共产主义而奋斗的志愿更加明确了，为革命而干的劲头更足了。遇到困难的时候，一想起毛主席的教导，一想起自己的志愿，就产生了巨大的勇气和力量，就有了克服困难的信心和决心。有一次，我在做推行四万四千伏带电水冲瓷瓶的试验中，由于不慎发生了一次短路事故。这时候，我胆怯、犹豫了，不敢再推行了。可是我又一想：这样做不对，毛主席经常教导我们，越是困难的时候，越应该有勇气去战胜困难，难道我被这次事故吓倒了吗？想到这里，我就鼓起勇气，决定坚持下去。心里有了这种要求，斗志也就增强了，很快从失败中取得教训，并在各单位的配合下，大胆地在二十二万伏设备上进行了试验。
    等电位作业在前东北电业管理局中心试验所试验成功后，我参加了推行二十二万伏等电位作业的试验工作。开始时，自己也想了许多问题，如一百一十伏到二百二十伏的电都能把人电死，而二十二万伏比它高一、二千倍，可不能有半点含糊呀！当时，其他同志也有许多的顾虑。有些人说：“二十二万伏，电压那么高，导线电晕那么大，鸟都不敢往上落，用人身接触能行吗？人身上有电阻，与二十二万伏带电体接触后，就会产生电位差，一动作就会冒火星！人身上脏了不行，有汗不行，这都容易冒火星……。”还有些人说：“会不会杀伤红血球，白血球？会不会影响神经和生育？等电位的原理国外是知道的，可是科学发达的一些国家都不搞，必是其中有些问题！”我想，外国人不搞，我们中国人要搞，中国人应该有骨气做出自己的科学实验，搞出自己的科学成果来。我们不但要破坏一个旧世界，还要能够建设出一个新世界。究竟行不行，到底能不能搞，除了做理论上的分析以外，就得用实践来检验了。“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，我是一个共产党员，在这紧要关头，应当挺身而出！于是我向领导上提出了试验申请。
    党委同意了我的申请，但领导上为了慎重起见，指示我进一步做好科学分析，先做好动物试验。于是，我们就先找了一只兔子，装在笼子里，吊在空中，然后往兔子身上通电加压。当电压升到十万伏的时候，兔子身上有些发抖，升到十八万伏的时候，兔子的耳朵就耷拉下来了，接着升到二十二万伏没有什么新的变化。把电停下来以后，兔子的精神又恢复正常。那么，兔子为什么发抖，耳朵为什么耷拉下来呢？我们分析认为：发抖，主要是电压升到十万伏的时候，放电声音太大，兔子有些害怕；耳朵耷拉下来是因为兔子耳朵长，产生尖端放电。这都是正常现象。以后，领导上同意了开始用人试验。
    在试验的头一天晚上，我的心情很不平静，想了许多问题。夜深了，全家人都睡下了，而我还是翻来覆去睡不着，万一发生意外的思想还在脑海里动荡着……。可是，当我一想起由于停电作业，就迫使许多厂矿成千上万的职工停止生产，直接影响社会主义建设；想起自己是一个共产党员，入党的时候，申请书上写着：把一切献给党，献给共产主义，必要的时候可以献出自己的生命；想起毛主席的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲……”，“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，就使我振作起精神，使我增加了勇气和力量。我想，董存瑞、黄继光和许多革命先烈，他们明明知道是去牺牲的，可是却能奋不顾身。何况我们这次试验是有充分科学根据的，为了社会主义建设，为了厂矿不间断生产，更应该从容镇静，有勇气，有不怕自我牺牲的精神。第二天，我精神饱满、毫不胆怯地参加了试验工作。当我走进布置严密的试验室里的时候，工人同志都亲切地问候我休息的怎样？领导同志也亲自帮助我穿上金属丝编织的外衣。当我登上试验笼的时候，感到有些紧张，这主要是对二十二万伏电压缺乏实践的原故，所以我努力使自己平静下来。最紧张的是在要合闸给电而还没有合闸给电的那一刹那。“拍达”一声，高压开关合上了。操纵台上的工程师喊出了一万、两万、四万……的声音，直到六万的时候，我才松了一口气。我想，情况很好，不要紧啦，如有事早就该完啦。当我获得了直接的感觉经验之后，把握更大了。当电压升到十万伏的时候，下边的同志就喊：“老郑帽上有火星！”我先是吓了一跳，但立即想到，这个时候最重要的是镇静。我又一细想，这可能是小铜线头支出来，发生尖端放电现象，于是我就用手压了一下，果然火星没有了。当电压升到十八万伏的时候，眉毛和脸上的汗毛竖起来了，鼻子上产生了气流现象。由于已经把握了实践经验，从而使自己不再紧张了，并当即作了分析，认为这是尖端放电的正常现象。这时，我请示总指挥说：“对鼻尖的气流现象，可不可以做一下遮闭试验？”总指挥点头表示同意。于是我就用手遮闭了一下，一遮闭就没有了，一放开又出现了，这就证明我们的判断是正确的。坚持继续升压，直到二十二万伏，我摘下手套，在导线上进行了一些简单的作业。一切都达到了预想的效果。试验完了，我在群众的掌声和欢呼声中，走出了金属笼。当领导同志同我亲切地握手时，激动得我两眼涌出了泪水。以后，又在变电所母线上和四十二米高的输电线路上，成功地进行了各种操作试验。就这样，我和工人群众一起，为党为人民做了一件自己应该做的工作。
    许多事实使我深刻体会到，只有平时注意在艰苦的劳动中锻炼自己，注意培养自己的意志，才能在困难的时刻挺身而出。否则，那种“勇敢”就没有坚实的基础。所以必须坚持与工人群众相结合，长期在艰苦的劳动中磨练自己，长期在生产实践中向工人学习，要处处以一个革命者的标准要求自己，全心全意为人民服务，只有这样才能在生产上做出贡献。
    几年来，带电作业技术的迅速发展，充分说明生产上的主要因素是工人群众。事实告诉我们，只有工人群众在千万次的操作实践中，才能不断总结经验，不断革新工具，改进作业方法。到目前，先后创制出了一千零四十余件带电作业工具，在送、变、配电设备上，基本上实现了带电检修，并使工具达到了新的轻便化程度。某些项目与美国、日本比较，工具比他们轻，检修人员比他们少，检修时间比他们短。这些成就都是工人群众的创造，我仅仅是起到了一个技术人员应起的一点作用。
    几年来的实践使我深刻认识到：一个工程技术人员要走革命化的道路，必须学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想。同时，必须同工人群众相结合，坚持劳动锻炼，才能和工人打成一片，才能学到工人阶级的思想感情和生产实践经验，才能使所学习的知识发挥作用。
    我深深地体会到，只有用毛泽东思想，才能不断克服自己头脑中残存的个人主义私念，才能真正学到为人民服务的本领。几年来，我虽然注意了学习毛主席著作，初步懂得了同工人群众相结合的道理，但这只能说仅仅是开始。今后，我一定更加努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，更好地同工农群众相结合，做一个名副其实的工人阶级的知识分子。
