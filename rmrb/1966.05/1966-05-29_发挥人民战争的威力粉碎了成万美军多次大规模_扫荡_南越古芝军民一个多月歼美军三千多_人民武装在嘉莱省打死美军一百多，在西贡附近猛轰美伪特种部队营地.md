    HANOI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the army and people of Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, South Vietnam, displaying the power of people's war, continuously crushed multiple "sweeps" launched by tens of thousands of American aggressor troops during the dry season, achieving great victories. In just over a month, from January 8 to February 24, the Cu Chi army and people eliminated more than 3,300 American aggressor troops, shot down and damaged nearly 90 enemy aircraft, and destroyed and blew up 80 military vehicles of various types.

    The Cu Chi liberated area is located northwest of Saigon, and for a long time, it has been like a sharp sword inserted into the enemy's chest. In order to break the encirclement of Saigon, the American aggressors mobilized the 3rd Brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade to conduct a large-scale "sweep" of the Cu Chi liberated area in early January. However, in the first engagement from January 8 to 19, the Cu Chi army and people defeated the American aggressor troops' offensive, annihilating more than 1,600 enemy troops, shooting down and damaging more than 80 enemy aircraft, and destroying 56 military vehicles of various types.

    After suffering a defeat, the enemy retreated to the Behe area, two kilometers northeast of Cu Chi District, on January 24, attempting to establish a stronghold here to control Highways 1 and 8 as a springboard for invading the Cu Chi liberated area, and to connect with other U.S. military strongholds from Thu Dau Mot Province to Ben Tre Province, forming a forward defense line northwest of Saigon. However, the enemy's scheme failed. On January 24, as soon as the American aggressor troops withdrew from Zhonghe Township, the guerrillas immediately surrounded them, constantly attacking and harassing them, causing them to tremble with fear and be in a state of utter disarray, eventually forcing them to retreat.

    Through heroic fighting, the Cu Chi army and people crushed the enemy's "sweep," successfully defended the liberated area, and contributed to thwarting the American aggressors' "dry season offensive" plan.

    HANOI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the army and people of Gia Lai Province, South Vietnam, launched continuous proactive attacks from April 28 to May 25, killing 257 enemy troops, including 149 American aggressors, and destroying five artillery pieces and mortars.

    The report said that during this period, the U.S.-puppet clique mobilized four battalions of troops, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and artillery, to launch continuous "sweeps" against some liberated areas southeast of Pleiku. Local liberation armed forces and guerrillas constantly ambushed and attacked the enemy, inflicting heavy blows. At the same time, the guerrillas also used the favorable terrain of the mountains to place simple weapons that kill the enemy everywhere, making it difficult for the American bandits and puppet troops to move an inch, causing them to be terrified and uneasy.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 28. Saigon News: The South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces have launched successive offensives near Saigon in the past two days, severely damaging a puppet army battalion and fiercely attacking a U.S.-puppet special forces camp.

    According to Western news agencies, on the 26th, the Liberation Armed Forces launched an offensive against a puppet army battalion stationed about 109 kilometers southwest of Saigon. After a fierce mortar bombardment, Liberation Army soldiers broke into the puppet army's position and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On the night of the 27th, the Liberation Armed Forces used mortars and recoilless guns to fiercely bombard a U.S.-puppet special forces camp 40 kilometers west of Saigon, causing heavy casualties to the puppet troops stationed there.

    发挥人民战争的威力粉碎了成万美军多次大规模“扫荡”
    南越古芝军民一个多月歼美军三千多
    人民武装在嘉莱省打死美军一百多，在西贡附近猛轰美伪特种部队营地
    据新华社河内二十八日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方嘉定省古芝县军民发挥人民战争的威力，在旱季期间接连粉碎了成万名美国侵略军发动的多次“扫荡”，取得了很大的胜利。仅一月八日到二月二十四日的一个多月中，古芝军民就消灭了美国侵略军三千三百多名，击落、击伤敌机近九十架，击毁和炸毁各种军车八十辆。
    古芝解放区位于西贡西北，长期以来，它象一把利剑插在敌人胸脯上。为了打破西贡被包围的局面，美国侵略者在一月初出动了美国第一步兵师第三旅、第一七三空降旅，对古芝解放区进行大规模“扫荡”。但是，就在一月八日到十九日的首次交战中，古芝军民就击败了美国侵略军的进攻，歼敌一千六百多名，击落和击伤敌机八十多架，炸毁各种军车五十六辆。
    敌人吃了败仗后，于一月二十四日撤退到古芝县城东北两公里的北河地区，企图在这里建立据点，控制第一和第八号公路，作为进犯古芝解放区的跳板，并且同从土龙木省到堤岸省的其他美军据点连接起来，在西贡西北面形成一条前沿防线。但是，敌人的这个阴谋未能得逞。一月二十四日，当美国侵略军刚从中和乡撤下来，游击队就立即把他们层层包围起来，不断袭击和骚扰，打得他们胆战心惊，狼狈不堪，最后迫使他们撤退回去。
    古芝军民经过英勇战斗，粉碎了敌人的“扫荡”，胜利地保卫了解放区，为挫败美国侵略者的“旱季攻势”计划作出了贡献。
    据新华社河内二十八日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉莱省军民在四月二十八日到五月二十五日期间，连续主动出击，打死敌人二百五十七名，其中包括有一百四十九个美国侵略者，击毁大炮和迫击炮五门。
    报道说，在这个时期，美伪集团出动了四个营的兵力，在大批飞机和大炮的掩护下，对波来古东南面的一些解放区发动连续的“扫荡”。当地解放武装力量和游击队不断狙击和袭击敌人，给敌人以重大打击。与此同时，游击队还利用山区的有利地形，到处布满杀伤敌人的简陋武器，打得美国强盗和伪军寸步难行，惶恐不安。
    据新华社二十八日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量近两天来在西贡附近接连发动进攻，重创伪军一个营，猛烈袭击了美伪特种部队营地。
    据西方通讯社报道，二十六日，解放武装力量向驻在西贡西南约一百零九公里地方的一营伪军发动进攻。在以猛烈的迫击炮火进行轰击后，解放军战士们突入了伪军的阵地，同敌人展开肉搏战，大量杀伤了敌军。二十七日夜间，解放武装力量用迫击炮和无后座力炮猛烈轰击了西贡以西四十公里的美伪特种部队营地，使驻在那里伪军遭到了很大伤亡。
