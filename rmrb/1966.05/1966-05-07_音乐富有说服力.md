    The educational significance and infectious power of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" are very strong. The play more clearly highlights the class struggle, highlights the spirit of resistance of Yang Bailao and Xi'er as representatives of the oppressed class, and powerfully illustrates that only with the leadership of the Party can the victory of the struggle be achieved, and that the revolution must be carried through to the end (the liberated Xi'er firmly marches forward carrying a gun) in order to achieve complete liberation. It is very inspiring to watch.
    Ballet art is a foreign form, originally developed to express the lives and thoughts of bourgeois talented scholars and beautiful women. Now it has been transformed to reflect China's revolutionary struggles and the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which in itself is an astonishing event. Rooting the uniqueness of ballet in the national and mass foundation and achieving such success has profound significance not only in our country but also in the world. This is the result of the ideological revolutionization of creators and performers, and it once again proves that as long as we highlight politics, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, any fortress can be broken through and one victory after another can be achieved.
    This ballet broke through the foreign framework of ballet only being dance plus pantomime, adding a large amount of choral singing, songs (not interludes), and using the techniques of local opera accompaniment in our country, organically applying them where most needed, greatly enriching the expressiveness, making up for the limitations of dance in revealing strong inner activities, and at the same time improving the purposefulness and accuracy of dance language. More importantly, doing so can make the audience understand better and be more moved, which is precisely the embodiment of the mass character of proletarian art.
    The music of the entire ballet is very persuasive. On the basis of the opera "The White-Haired Girl," many important developments and re-creations have been made according to the new content requirements and characteristics of the ballet, and it is coherent, completely obeying the needs of the play, unlike European ballets which prioritize music and can be paused section by section (in Europe, to cater to the audience, a section can be replayed regardless of disrupting the plot). In particular, the composer's methods are simple and clear, always maintaining the leading position of complete melody, and striving to process according to the variation principle of folk music, in order to adapt to the development of dramatic music. For example, the melody of "The North Wind Blows" is treated with different characteristics in different plots, closely matching Xi'er's inner monologue, achieving a very good effect. Adding national musical instruments such as the banhu to the orchestra also played a finishing touch in the character portrayal; all of these make people feel kind and moving, adding national color to the ballet, and conforming to the aesthetic habits of the broad masses.
    The achievements of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" are multifaceted and worthy of our serious study.

    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的教育意义和感染力量是非常强烈的。剧中更加鲜明地突出了阶级斗争，突出了作为被压迫阶级代表的杨白劳、喜儿的反抗精神，并有力地说明了必须有党的领导才能获得斗争的胜利，而且必须将革命进行到底（翻了身的喜儿坚定地扛着枪前进）才能求得彻底解放。看后使人非常振奋。
    芭蕾舞艺术是一种外来的形式，它本来是为表现资产阶级才子佳人的生活和思想感情发展起来的，现在把它改造过来，用来反映中国的革命斗争和工农兵的思想感情，这本身就是一个惊人的大事。把芭蕾舞的独特性根植于民族的、群众的基础之上，取得如此成功，这不仅在我国，而且在全世界都有深远的意义。这是创作者和演出者思想革命化的结果，又一次证明了，只要我们突出政治，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，无论什么堡垒都可以攻破，取得一个又一个的胜利。
    这个舞剧突破了芭蕾舞剧只能是舞蹈加哑剧的洋框框，大量加进伴唱，歌曲（不是插曲），运用我国一些地方戏帮腔的手法，有机地运用在最需要的地方，大大丰富了表现力，弥补了舞蹈在揭示强烈的内心活动方面的局限性，同时也提高了舞蹈语言的目的性和准确性。更主要的是，这样做能使观众看得更明白，更受感动，这正是无产阶级艺术群众化的体现。
    整个舞剧的音乐说服力很强。在歌剧《白毛女》的基调上，根据新的内容要求和舞剧特点做了许多重要的发展和再创作，而且连贯一气，完全服从剧的需要，不象欧洲舞剧那样以音乐为主，并且可以一段段地停顿（在欧洲，为了迎合观众，可以不顾破坏剧情重演一段），特别是作曲者采用的手段朴实简明、始终保持完整的旋律的主导地位，并力求按民间音乐的变奏原则来处理，以适应于戏剧音乐的发展。如《北风吹》的曲调，在不同的情节中处理为不同的性格、紧密地配合着喜儿的内心独白，取得了很好的效果。在管弦乐队中加用板胡等民族乐器，对人物刻划也起了画龙点睛的作用；这些都使人听起来亲切动人，为舞剧增添了民族色彩，符合广大群众的欣赏习惯。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的成就是多方面的，值得我们大家认真学习。
