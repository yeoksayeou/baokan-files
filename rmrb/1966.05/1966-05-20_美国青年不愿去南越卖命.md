    American youth are increasingly awakening. They are adopting various methods to oppose the draft and refuse to go to Vietnam to die for the Johnson administration's policy of aggression against Vietnam. Not long ago, an official from the Chicago Draft Board told CBS that 99 percent of American youth do not want to serve in the military. The British newspaper *The Guardian* published a dispatch from Washington stating that the current phenomenon of opposition to military service in the United States is unprecedented in the history of warfare, that "for American youth being drafted to fight in Vietnam, this is the most unpopular war in American history," and that "many young people are strongly dissatisfied with being sent to die in the jungles and swamps of faraway Vietnam, and they do not believe there is any just reason to do so."

    John Slemmons, a youth from Bellingham, Washington, wrote a letter to *Spark*, the organ of the Progressive Labor Party published on the American West Coast, stating the reasons why he refused to be drafted, saying, "I refuse to serve in any army of the United States. I have clear reasons for doing so," "I am a poor man. I am poor, and I feel that we poor people must fight against our living conditions. I cannot, on the one hand, fight to improve my own conditions and the conditions of the poor in my country, and on the other hand, turn around and help suppress the poor people of Vietnam... I refuse to participate in the slaughter and atrocities that the United States is carrying out in Vietnam."

    Jeff Gordon, a student at Brooklyn College, recently distributed a statement at the White Hall Army Enlistment Center in New York State to newly drafted recruits, opposing the American war of aggression against Vietnam and opposing the draft. The statement said, "We are the people being drafted. Many of us will be sent to fight in the jungles of Vietnam. This war is very unpopular in the United States and around the world. Many people believe it is an unjust war," "We fight, kill, and die in Vietnam, and the big bosses of America's major defense industries make a fortune – when a helicopter is shot down, they build another one. One of the big shots promoting this war, Defense Secretary McNamara, was until recently the general manager of the Ford Motor Company, which has tens of millions of dollars in defense contracts with the government," "Peace means reduced profits, and war means increased profits. That's why they send us to Vietnam to kill and die."

    American youth are also devising various ways to evade military service in order to avoid becoming cannon fodder in South Vietnam. An article published in *The Wall Street Journal* on April 11 stated that the most common way for American college students to evade the draft is to continue studying at school. A university graduate school authority said that enrollment is expected to increase significantly this autumn due to the draft. Currently, some universities have changed the four-year system to a five-year system. Students outside of school are trying to find occupations that provide exemptions or deferments, such as education, culture, and health, civil defense work, and staying on farms. An official in Kansas said that there are about eight or nine hundred cases in the state requesting to stay on farms to enjoy deferments. Many young people, when drafted, appeal to the authorities for hardship deferments due to family difficulties. *The Wall Street Journal* said that more people pretend to be mentally disturbed or fabricate various illnesses during physical examinations. According to officers at the examination stations, recently a Chicago youth, in order to prove his mental disorder, pretended to be rowdy during a psychological test, then fell to the floor, screamed, groaned, and tried to tear off his clothes.

    Now, the broad masses of American youth and students have left their classrooms and taken to the streets to participate in the struggle against the war of aggression against Vietnam and against the draft. Many people, regardless of the obstruction and persecution of the American authorities, publicly burn or tear up their draft cards issued by the American government to show their determination to fight to the end. Their struggle will surely promote the advancement of the American people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam and give the Johnson government a heavy blow. (Fan Wen)

    美国青年不愿去南越卖命
    广大美国青年日益觉醒。他们正在采取各种方式反对征兵，拒绝到越南去为约翰逊政府侵略越南的政策送死。不久以前，芝加哥征兵局的一个官员向哥伦比亚广播系统发表谈话说，百分之九十九的美国青年不愿意服兵役。英国《卫报》刊登的自华盛顿发出的消息说，目前美国反对服兵役现象在战争史上是空前的，“对于正在被征召到越南去打仗的美国青年说来，这是美国历史上最不得人心的一次战争”，“许多青年对被派到遥远的越南的丛林和沼泽地中去送死，感到强烈不满，他们不相信有什么正当的理由要这样做”。
    华盛顿州贝林哈姆市青年约翰·斯莱姆卡写信给美国西海岸出版的进步劳工党机关报《火花》，申述他拒绝被征入伍的理由说，“我拒绝在美国的任何军队中服役。我这样做有明确的理由”，“我是一个穷人。我穷，我觉得我们穷人必须为反对我们的生活条件而斗争。我不能一方面为改善我自己以及我国穷人的条件而斗争，另方面却转过身去帮助镇压越南的穷苦人……我拒绝参加美国正在越南进行的屠杀和暴行”。
    美国布鲁克林学院学生杰夫·戈登最近在纽约州的怀特霍尔陆军入伍中心向被征入伍新兵散发声明，反对美国侵越战争和反对征兵。声明说，“我们是被征入伍的人。我们之中有许多人将被派往越南的丛林作战。这场战争在美国和全世界都是非常不得人心的。许多人都认为这是一场不义的战争”，“我们在越南打仗、杀人、送命，美国的主要国防工业的大老板大发横财——直升飞机被击落一架，他们就另造一架。鼓动这场战争的大头目之一国防部长麦克纳马拉不久之前是福特汽车公司的总经理，这家公司同政府订有几千万美元的防务合同”，“和平意味着利润减少，战争意味着利润增加。他们把我们派到越南杀人和送命，原因就在这里。”
    美国青年为了反对去南越当炮灰，还想出各种办法逃避兵役。美国《华尔街日报》四月十一日登载的一篇文章说，美国大学生逃避征兵最常用的办法是继续留在学校里念书。一大学研究院当局说，由于征兵，预料今秋入学注册人数将会大大增加。目前，有的大学已把四年制改成五年制。校外学生则设法寻找免役或缓役的职业，如文教卫生事业、民防工作以及留在农场工作等。堪萨斯州一个官员说，这个州约有八、九百起要求留在农场以享受缓役的事例。许多青年在应征的时候，向有关当局申诉家庭的困难，请求缓役。《华尔街日报》说，更多的人在体格检查时，假装神经错乱，捏造各种病情。据检查站的军官们说，最近有一个芝加哥青年，为了证实他的神经错乱，在接受心理测验时，假装要打闹的样子，接着倒在地板上，尖叫、呻吟，并试图撕下自己的衣服。
    现在，美国广大青年和学生已经纷纷走出课堂，走上街头，参加反对侵越战争和反对征兵的斗争。许多人不顾美国当局的阻挠、迫害，当众烧毁或撕毁美国政府的征兵证，以表示他们斗争到底的决心。他们的斗争必将推动美国人民反对侵越战争的运动前进，而给约翰逊政府以沉重的打击。（凡文）
