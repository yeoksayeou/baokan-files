    Deng Tuo, We Will Not Let You Go
    Good Fighters of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Guo Fengyu, Xue Xibao
    After reading Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist article, "The Great Empty Talk," we were extremely angry. The revisionist ringleader Khrushchev once incited, saying: It is necessary to bravely and resolutely expose the dogmatism about the absurd "East Wind and West Wind" competition.
    Deng Tuo also broke out, viciously attacking our beloved leader Chairman Mao's scientific thesis of "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind" as "great empty talk" and "cliches." Isn't this singing the same tune as Khrushchev?
    Chairman Mao, seeing that the international situation had reached a new turning point, with the forces of socialism overwhelming the forces of imperialism, vividly compared the East Wind to the revolutionary forces of the proletariat and the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism, and the West Wind to the declining imperialism and all reactionary forces. The assertion "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind" is absolutely true. It greatly encourages the struggle of the oppressed and exploited people of the world for freedom and liberation, enables people to see the international situation more clearly, boosts the morale of the people, and deflates the arrogance of the enemy.
    Deng Tuo, put away your anti-Party face! We will never listen to your nonsense, nor will we allow you to slander the great Mao Zedong Thought and viciously attack our beloved Party. We soldiers believe in and defend Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. You have wantonly slandered and cursed our Party, and we will not let you go. History will not spare you either; debts must be repaid.

    邓拓，我们不会放过你
    解放军某部五好战士　郭凤羽　薛喜宝
    看了邓拓写的《伟大的空话》这篇反党反社会主义的文章后，我们非常气愤。修正主义头子赫鲁晓夫曾经煽动地说：必须勇敢和坚决的揭露关于荒唐无稽的“西风和东风”竞争的教条主义。
    邓拓也破门而出，恶毒地攻击我们敬爱的领袖毛主席提出的“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是“伟大的空话”，是“陈词滥调”，这不是和赫鲁晓夫唱的一个调子吗？
    毛主席看到国际形势到了一个新的转折点，社会主义的力量压倒了帝国主义的力量，形象地把东风比作无产阶级和亚非拉被压迫人民反对帝国主义的革命力量，把西风比做日暮途穷的帝国主义和一切反动势力。“东风压倒西风”这一论断是千真万确的，它给世界上被压迫被剥削的人民争取自由解放的斗争以极大的鼓舞，使人们更正确地看清了国际的形势，长了人民的志气，灭了敌人的威风。
    邓拓，收起你的反党嘴脸吧，我们决不听你的鬼话，也决不容许你诬蔑伟大的毛泽东思想，恶毒的攻击我们敬爱的党。我们战士是信仰和捍卫马列主义和毛泽东思想的。你对我们党大肆诬蔑和咒骂，我们是不会放过你的。历史也不会饶你的，欠债一定要还。
