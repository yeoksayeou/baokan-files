    Shanghai Ushers in a Socialist Cultural Revolution Climax
    The Broad Masses of Revolutionary People, Armed with the Great Mao Zedong Thought, Plunge into the Class Struggle of Promoting Proletarian Ideology and Eliminating Bourgeois Ideology; the Broad Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ascend the Cultural and Academic Stage, Becoming the Main Force of the Socialist Cultural Revolution
    (Our Newspaper Shanghai, May 19th dispatch) Shanghai is at the height of the Socialist Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are fiercely opening fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, giving Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han, and other demons and monsters a fatal counterattack.
    Shanghai is a city with millions of industrial workers. The strength of the proletariat is extremely powerful and endowed with a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. For seventeen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of revolutionary people have carried out one victorious struggle after another against the bourgeoisie on the cultural front. Especially since September 1962, when Chairman Mao, at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, issued the great call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country not to forget class and class struggle, the Shanghai Party organization, leading the broad masses of revolutionary people, further unfolded the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology on the cultural front, powerfully striking at bourgeois cultural trends and promoting the flourishing development of revolutionary culture. Last November, the Shanghai newspapers published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," exposing Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, and the struggle entered a new stage. In this struggle to destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop, the revolutionary momentum is even more magnificent.
    In recent days, in thousands of factories throughout the city, in the rural areas of the suburbs and the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, in various government organs, schools, and even neighborhood streets, people have been verbally and in writing denouncing and angrily condemning Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist groups. Some workers spontaneously gathered together to denounce the crimes of the "Three-Family Village"; some wrote counter-attack articles all night long; some dictated and had their children write them down. Many soldiers also took up their pens to destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop; some sailors, returning to Shanghai from long voyages, indignantly participated in the symposiums criticizing the "Three-Family Village." Revolutionary intellectuals also participated in the struggle through discussions and writing articles. The wall newspapers, blackboards, and radio stations of various units are filled with the sound of battle; the various newspapers in Shanghai have published a large number of sharp combat articles by workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals. Newspapers and the People's Broadcasting Station receive a large number of submissions from the masses every day. The *Jiefang Ribao* (Liberation Daily) alone received more than 7,000 letters and contributions from the masses in nine days. The cultural revolutionary fighting spirit of the people of Shanghai has never been as high as it is today.
    The current Socialist Cultural Revolution in Shanghai has two extremely distinct characteristics: First, the broad masses of revolutionary people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are plunging into this class struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology; second, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are ascending the cultural and academic stage, becoming the powerful main force of the Socialist Cultural Revolution. Since last year, Shanghai has seen a climax of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and more and more cadres and masses have gained a deeper understanding of Mao Zedong Thought. In this struggle, they are learning while fighting on the front lines. At present, they are repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," as well as Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle and culture and art. Therefore, they have a very high level of discernment and immediately grasped the reactionary essence of the "Three-Family Village" and other demons and monsters.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are participating in the battle with a brand-new attitude, giving rise to an unusual situation in this struggle on the cultural front. Under the leadership of the Party, they have carried out long-term revolutionary struggles and have a close relationship with the Party. In this struggle, they take to the battlefield with deep class feelings. Their speeches and articles are filled with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao and profound hatred for the class enemies. The anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang have ignited uncontrollable anger in their hearts. Many people are intertwined with old and new hatreds; some people at the symposiums roll up their trousers, point to the scars left by the landlords' dogs before liberation, and become increasingly indignant, expressing their determination not to allow the defeated enemies to make a comeback. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers excitedly said: We love Chairman Mao the most. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who led us to stand up. We will never allow anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to slander our great Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao! Yi Shijuan, a famous national advanced producer from the No. 2 State Cotton Mill, and the workers in her group became more and more excited during the symposium. Everyone could not help but sing the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" to express their love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao.
    At the symposium of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Chen Fu, known as the "Iron Man" among Shanghai workers, denounced the crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang while accusing the evils of the old society. Before liberation, his father died of exhaustion from hard labor, his brother drowned in the Huangpu River, and his mother could not survive and committed suicide. Chen Fu said indignantly: "Our country is not allowed to be touched by bad guys!" Qiu Caiåº·, who was severely burned and rescued by the Party in every possible way, said excitedly: "My skin was given by the Party and the people, my blood was given by the Party and the people, and my life was given by the Party and Chairman Mao. Deng Tuo's kid slandered our great Party and Chairman Mao, and I will fight him to the death!" Ji Dezhang, a Shanghai agricultural labor model, had worked as a long-term laborer for many years in the old society. At the symposium, he talked excitedly about the profound changes in the political and material life of the poor and lower-middle peasants since liberation. He said: "We peasants have always dug out old roots when digging out poisonous weeds; this time, we will not give up until we dig out the old roots of Deng Tuo and his gang!" The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are determined to hold Mao Zedong Thought high, brighten their eyes, sharpen their pens, and completely destroy this gang of black thugs in this struggle!
      The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have a firm stand, clear banners, and sharp and insightful speeches and articles. This is another unusual phenomenon in this struggle. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers used Chairman Mao's great theories on class and class struggle to make a profound analysis of the serious significance of this struggle and the nature of the "Three-Family Village" group's organized, led, and planned attack. They said: "This struggle without guns is a fierce, complex, and long-term life-and-death class struggle." "This is a major event related to whether or not we can build socialism and move towards communism, and a major event related to the future of the world revolution!" They firmly believe: "Deng Tuo and his gang are the internal agents of imperialism and modern revisionism." "Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are the international 'Three-Family Village' that opposes us; Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and their gang are the domestic 'Three-Family Village' that opposes us. The two 'Three-Family Villages,' one in the open and one in the dark, singing in unison, vainly attempting to change the sky!" "New Front, Beijing Daily, and other newspapers and periodicals are playing tricks of falsely exposing but truly protecting, falsely criticizing but truly covering up, attempting to help Deng Tuo and his gang of black thugs get away with it, which is absolutely impossible!" "No matter whether the evil wind of the 'Three-Family Village' blows out of the sewer or out of the air-raid shelter; no matter what color or coat you poisonous snakes wear, we will sweep you all away!" Chen Xinyu, the Party branch secretary of Dexin Smelter, a Daqing-style advanced unit, who came from a worker's background, wrote three counter-attack articles in a week. He peeled off the skin of Deng Tuo and his gang layer by layer, exposing the sinister and vicious reactionary faces of the "Three-Family Village" group in broad daylight.
      The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai used their personal practices since the Great Leap Forward, displaying the miracles they created in the great Three Revolutionary Movements, to denounce Deng Tuo and his gang's fallacies that slandered the Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "talking big," and "bumping their heads and bleeding in the face of actual things," refuting Deng Tuo and his gang to the point where they were covered in bruises. Since 1958, the Shanghai working class has been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the general line, and adhering to the spirit of thorough revolution. Even when China's economy was suffering temporary difficulties and Deng Tuo and his gang were hiding in their rat holes cursing the sun, the Shanghai working class continued to adhere to and carry forward the revolutionary spirit, moving forward by leaps and bounds. In recent years, they have pushed the production of the iron and steel industry to a new height, raised the manufacturing technology of machinery and instruments to a new level, occupied one new industrial production field after another, and produced many precision and cutting-edge products. The Shanghai working class pioneered the double-water inner-cooled turbogenerator, and manufactured the world's rare 10,000-ton hydraulic press, high-precision semi-automatic universal cylindrical grinder, high-yield motor, etc. Tremendous changes have taken place in Shanghai's industrial landscape. The peasants and workers in the suburbs of Shanghai are advancing side by side, running the people's communes better and better, and agricultural production has been growing steadily for eight consecutive years. The workers, peasants, and soldiers of Shanghai indignantly questioned Deng Tuo and his gang: Are your eyes blind? What kind of ghosts are you harboring in your vicious attacks?
    The broad masses of cadres and revolutionary intellectuals also participated in the battle with great revolutionary enthusiasm. In the previous period, they had in-depth discussions on the relationship between politics and profession. The current serious class struggle has made them concretely and deeply feel why it is necessary to give prominence to politics. Many young intellectuals expressed such determination: To listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely take the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and become the revolutionary successors of the proletariat; to experience wind and rain, see the world, train ourselves, transform ourselves, and completely destroy Deng Tuo and his gang's conspiracy to poison young people and engage in "peaceful evolution" in this struggle. Some graduating students from institutions of higher learning, seeing that Deng Tuo spread the poison of "father and daughter depending on each other for life" and "not suitable to travel far from home" in *Yanshan Yehua* (Evening Talks from Yanshan), aroused unparalleled indignation. They immediately expressed to the Party organization: We are children of workers and peasants, descendants of revolutionaries, and we must follow the Party and Chairman Mao closely. We are about to graduate, and we firmly demand to go to the countryside, to the mountainous areas, to all places where the Party needs us most. We just want to "travel far from home"!
    In this struggle, a cultural and theoretical team composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is rapidly forming and constantly growing. In Jiangnan Shipyard, 400 people have now formed 20 combat teams; in Qiuxin Shipyard, all the workers in the factory, either collectively or individually, wrote more than 540 articles criticizing Deng Tuo and his gang in a few days. In institutions of higher learning, students have also formed amateur writing groups, and many young teachers and students are in the same writing group, fighting together. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals concentrated their fire to fiercely attack the "Three-Family Village" black shop; and with revolutionary passion, they created poems, dances, scripts, and other works that praised the Party, praised Chairman Mao, and expressed the heroic feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Thousands of steelworkers and cadres from Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant participated in discussing and revising the factory's play reflecting the workers' struggle to catch up with advanced levels. They said that they must write and revise this script well, and use it as a heavy shell to fight back against those anti-Party and anti-socialist "authorities" and "experts"!
    The emergence of this cultural and theoretical team composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals shows an irresistible trend: The idols of the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" must be overthrown! The leadership of the cultural circles that has been stolen must be taken back completely, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy all cultural positions!
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Shanghai, bearing in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, realize that this class struggle is long-term, complex, and tortuous, and the struggle has just begun. They are determined to carry the Socialist Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly destroy the "Three-Family Village," and sweep away all harmful monsters!
