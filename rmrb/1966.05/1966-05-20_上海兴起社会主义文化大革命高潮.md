    Thoroughly Smash the "Three-Family Village" and Sweep Away All Harmful Monsters
    Shanghai Ushers in a Socialist Cultural Revolution Climax
    The Broad Masses of Revolutionary People, Armed with the Great Mao Zedong Thought, Plunge into the Class Struggle of Promoting Proletarian Ideology and Eliminating Bourgeois Ideology; the Broad Masses of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ascend the Cultural and Academic Stage, Becoming the Main Force of the Socialist Cultural Revolution
    (Our Newspaper Shanghai, May 19th dispatch) Shanghai is at the height of the Socialist Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are fiercely opening fire on the anti-Party and anti-socialist black line, giving Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han, and other demons and monsters a fatal counterattack.
    Shanghai is a city with millions of industrial workers. The strength of the proletariat is extremely powerful and endowed with a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle. For seventeen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the broad masses of revolutionary people have carried out one victorious struggle after another against the bourgeoisie on the cultural front. Especially since September 1962, when Chairman Mao, at the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, issued the great call to the whole Party and the people of the whole country not to forget class and class struggle, the Shanghai Party organization, leading the broad masses of revolutionary people, further unfolded the struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology on the cultural front, powerfully striking at bourgeois cultural trends and promoting the flourishing development of revolutionary culture. Last November, the Shanghai newspapers published Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article "On the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," exposing Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, and the struggle entered a new stage. In this struggle to destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop, the revolutionary momentum is even more magnificent.
    In recent days, in thousands of factories throughout the city, in the rural areas of the suburbs and the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, in various government organs, schools, and even neighborhood streets, people have been verbally and in writing denouncing and angrily condemning Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and this small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist groups. Some workers spontaneously gathered together to denounce the crimes of the "Three-Family Village"; some wrote counter-attack articles all night long; some dictated and had their children write them down. Many soldiers also took up their pens to destroy the "Three-Family Village" black shop; some sailors, returning to Shanghai from long voyages, indignantly participated in the symposiums criticizing the "Three-Family Village." Revolutionary intellectuals also participated in the struggle through discussions and writing articles. The wall newspapers, blackboards, and radio stations of various units are filled with the sound of battle; the various newspapers in Shanghai have published a large number of sharp combat articles by workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals. Newspapers and the People's Broadcasting Station receive a large number of submissions from the masses every day. The *Jiefang Ribao* (Liberation Daily) alone received more than 7,000 letters and contributions from the masses in nine days. The cultural revolutionary fighting spirit of the people of Shanghai has never been as high as it is today.
    The current Socialist Cultural Revolution in Shanghai has two extremely distinct characteristics: First, the broad masses of revolutionary people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are plunging into this class struggle of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology; second, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are ascending the cultural and academic stage, becoming the powerful main force of the Socialist Cultural Revolution. Since last year, Shanghai has seen a climax of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and more and more cadres and masses have gained a deeper understanding of Mao Zedong Thought. In this struggle, they are learning while fighting on the front lines. At present, they are repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," as well as Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle and culture and art. Therefore, they have a very high level of discernment and immediately grasped the reactionary essence of the "Three-Family Village" and other demons and monsters.
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are participating in the battle with a brand-new attitude, giving rise to an unusual situation in this struggle on the cultural front. Under the leadership of the Party, they have carried out long-term revolutionary struggles and have a close relationship with the Party. In this struggle, they take to the battlefield with deep class feelings. Their speeches and articles are filled with boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao and profound hatred for the class enemies. The anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang have ignited uncontrollable anger in their hearts. Many people are intertwined with old and new hatreds; some people at the symposiums roll up their trousers, point to the scars left by the landlords' dogs before liberation, and become increasingly indignant, expressing their determination not to allow the defeated enemies to make a comeback. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers excitedly said: We love Chairman Mao the most. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who led us to stand up. We will never allow anti-Party and anti-socialist elements to slander our great Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao! Yi Shijuan, a famous national advanced producer from the No. 2 State Cotton Mill, and the workers in her group became more and more excited during the symposium. Everyone could not help but sing the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" to express their love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao.
    At the symposium of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, Chen Fu, known as the "Iron Man" among Shanghai workers, denounced the crimes of Deng Tuo and his gang while accusing the evils of the old society. Before liberation, his father died of exhaustion from hard labor, his brother drowned in the Huangpu River, and his mother could not survive and committed suicide. Chen Fu said indignantly: "Our country is not allowed to be touched by bad guys!" Qiu Cai康, who was severely burned and rescued by the Party in every possible way, said excitedly: "My skin was given by the Party and the people, my blood was given by the Party and the people, and my life was given by the Party and Chairman Mao. Deng Tuo's kid slandered our great Party and Chairman Mao, and I will fight him to the death!" Ji Dezhang, a Shanghai agricultural labor model, had worked as a long-term laborer for many years in the old society. At the symposium, he talked excitedly about the profound changes in the political and material life of the poor and lower-middle peasants since liberation. He said: "We peasants have always dug out old roots when digging out poisonous weeds; this time, we will not give up until we dig out the old roots of Deng Tuo and his gang!" The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are determined to hold Mao Zedong Thought high, brighten their eyes, sharpen their pens, and completely destroy this gang of black thugs in this struggle!
      The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have a firm stand, clear banners, and sharp and insightful speeches and articles. This is another unusual phenomenon in this struggle. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers used Chairman Mao's great theories on class and class struggle to make a profound analysis of the serious significance of this struggle and the nature of the "Three-Family Village" group's organized, led, and planned attack. They said: "This struggle without guns is a fierce, complex, and long-term life-and-death class struggle." "This is a major event related to whether or not we can build socialism and move towards communism, and a major event related to the future of the world revolution!" They firmly believe: "Deng Tuo and his gang are the internal agents of imperialism and modern revisionism." "Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are the international 'Three-Family Village' that opposes us; Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, and their gang are the domestic 'Three-Family Village' that opposes us. The two 'Three-Family Villages,' one in the open and one in the dark, singing in unison, vainly attempting to change the sky!" "New Front, Beijing Daily, and other newspapers and periodicals are playing tricks of falsely exposing but truly protecting, falsely criticizing but truly covering up, attempting to help Deng Tuo and his gang of black thugs get away with it, which is absolutely impossible!" "No matter whether the evil wind of the 'Three-Family Village' blows out of the sewer or out of the air-raid shelter; no matter what color or coat you poisonous snakes wear, we will sweep you all away!" Chen Xinyu, the Party branch secretary of Dexin Smelter, a Daqing-style advanced unit, who came from a worker's background, wrote three counter-attack articles in a week. He peeled off the skin of Deng Tuo and his gang layer by layer, exposing the sinister and vicious reactionary faces of the "Three-Family Village" group in broad daylight.
      The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai used their personal practices since the Great Leap Forward, displaying the miracles they created in the great Three Revolutionary Movements, to denounce Deng Tuo and his gang's fallacies that slandered the Great Leap Forward as "bragging," "talking big," and "bumping their heads and bleeding in the face of actual things," refuting Deng Tuo and his gang to the point where they were covered in bruises. Since 1958, the Shanghai working class has been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the general line, and adhering to the spirit of thorough revolution. Even when China's economy was suffering temporary difficulties and Deng Tuo and his gang were hiding in their rat holes cursing the sun, the Shanghai working class continued to adhere to and carry forward the revolutionary spirit, moving forward by leaps and bounds. In recent years, they have pushed the production of the iron and steel industry to a new height, raised the manufacturing technology of machinery and instruments to a new level, occupied one new industrial production field after another, and produced many precision and cutting-edge products. The Shanghai working class pioneered the double-water inner-cooled turbogenerator, and manufactured the world's rare 10,000-ton hydraulic press, high-precision semi-automatic universal cylindrical grinder, high-yield motor, etc. Tremendous changes have taken place in Shanghai's industrial landscape. The peasants and workers in the suburbs of Shanghai are advancing side by side, running the people's communes better and better, and agricultural production has been growing steadily for eight consecutive years. The workers, peasants, and soldiers of Shanghai indignantly questioned Deng Tuo and his gang: Are your eyes blind? What kind of ghosts are you harboring in your vicious attacks?
    The broad masses of cadres and revolutionary intellectuals also participated in the battle with great revolutionary enthusiasm. In the previous period, they had in-depth discussions on the relationship between politics and profession. The current serious class struggle has made them concretely and deeply feel why it is necessary to give prominence to politics. Many young intellectuals expressed such determination: To listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely take the road of integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and become the revolutionary successors of the proletariat; to experience wind and rain, see the world, train ourselves, transform ourselves, and completely destroy Deng Tuo and his gang's conspiracy to poison young people and engage in "peaceful evolution" in this struggle. Some graduating students from institutions of higher learning, seeing that Deng Tuo spread the poison of "father and daughter depending on each other for life" and "not suitable to travel far from home" in *Yanshan Yehua* (Evening Talks from Yanshan), aroused unparalleled indignation. They immediately expressed to the Party organization: We are children of workers and peasants, descendants of revolutionaries, and we must follow the Party and Chairman Mao closely. We are about to graduate, and we firmly demand to go to the countryside, to the mountainous areas, to all places where the Party needs us most. We just want to "travel far from home"!
    In this struggle, a cultural and theoretical team composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is rapidly forming and constantly growing. In Jiangnan Shipyard, 400 people have now formed 20 combat teams; in Qiuxin Shipyard, all the workers in the factory, either collectively or individually, wrote more than 540 articles criticizing Deng Tuo and his gang in a few days. In institutions of higher learning, students have also formed amateur writing groups, and many young teachers and students are in the same writing group, fighting together. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals concentrated their fire to fiercely attack the "Three-Family Village" black shop; and with revolutionary passion, they created poems, dances, scripts, and other works that praised the Party, praised Chairman Mao, and expressed the heroic feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Thousands of steelworkers and cadres from Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant participated in discussing and revising the factory's play reflecting the workers' struggle to catch up with advanced levels. They said that they must write and revise this script well, and use it as a heavy shell to fight back against those anti-Party and anti-socialist "authorities" and "experts"!
    The emergence of this cultural and theoretical team composed of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals shows an irresistible trend: The idols of the reactionary bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" must be overthrown! The leadership of the cultural circles that has been stolen must be taken back completely, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy all cultural positions!
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Shanghai, bearing in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, realize that this class struggle is long-term, complex, and tortuous, and the struggle has just begun. They are determined to carry the Socialist Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly destroy the "Three-Family Village," and sweep away all harmful monsters!

    彻底捣毁“三家村”扫除一切害人精
    上海兴起社会主义文化大革命高潮
    广大革命人民以伟大毛泽东思想为武器，投入兴无灭资的阶级斗争；广大工农兵登上文化、学术舞台，成为社会主义文化大革命的主力军
    本报上海十九日电　上海正处在社会主义文化大革命的高潮之中。广大工农兵群众、干部和革命知识分子，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，向着反党反社会主义的黑线猛烈开火，给邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗这些牛鬼蛇神以致命的反击。
    上海是拥有百万产业工人的城市，无产阶级的力量极其强大，而且富有光荣的革命斗争传统。解放十七年来，在党和毛主席的领导下，广大革命人民在文化战线上向资产阶级进行了一场又一场胜利的斗争。特别是一九六二年九月，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，向全党和全国人民发出了千万不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争的伟大号召以后，上海的党组织领导广大革命群众，在文化战线上进一步展开了兴无灭资的斗争，有力地打击了资产阶级的文化思潮，促使革命文化的兴旺发展。去年十一月间，上海报纸发表了姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文，揭露吴晗的反党反社会主义罪行之后，斗争进入了新的阶段。在这场摧毁“三家村”黑店的斗争中，革命声势更为壮阔。
    近些日来，在全市数千家工厂，在郊区农村和解放军驻上海各部队，在各个机关、学校，一直到里弄街道，人们口诛笔伐，愤怒谴责邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙这一小撮反党反社会主义集团。有些工人自动聚集一起，痛斥“三家村”的罪行；有的彻夜写反击文章；有的自己口述，叫儿女笔录。部队许多战士也拿起笔杆，摧毁“三家村”黑店；有些海员，远航回到上海，就激愤地参加批判“三家村”的座谈会。革命的知识分子，也纷纷座谈、写文章参加斗争。各个单位的墙报、黑板报和广播台，充满了战斗的声音；上海市的各报上，大量地刊载了工农兵和革命知识分子犀利的战斗文章。各报刊和人民广播电台，每天都收到群众的大批来稿，仅《解放日报》在九天中就收到群众来信来稿七千多件。上海人民群众文化革命的斗志，从来没有象今天这样高昂。
    当前上海的社会主义文化大革命具有两个极其鲜明的特色：一，广大革命人民以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，投入这场兴无灭资的阶级斗争；二，广大工农兵群众登上文化、学术的舞台，成为社会主义文化大革命的强大主力军。去年以来，上海出现了一个活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，越来越多的干部和群众更深地领会了毛泽东思想。在这次斗争中，他们又在火线上边战斗边学习。目前，他们正在反复地学习毛主席的《新民主主义论》《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》等四篇光辉著作，以及毛主席关于阶级斗争和文化艺术方面的语录。因此，他们具有很高的识别力，一下就抓住了“三家村”及其他牛鬼蛇神的反动本质。
    广大工农兵群众以崭新的姿态参加战斗，使这场文化战线上的斗争出现了不同寻常的局面。他们在党的领导下，进行过长期的革命斗争，和党有血肉的联系。在这场斗争中，他们带着深厚的阶级感情上阵，在发言和文章中充满了对党和毛主席的无限热爱和对阶级敌人的深刻仇恨。邓拓这一伙反党反社会主义罪行，在他们的心中燃起了无法抑制的怒火。许多人内心交织着旧恨新仇；有的人在座谈会上，卷起裤脚，指着解放前被地主的狗咬留下的疤痕，愈谈愈愤恨，表示决不让被打倒了的敌人卷土重来。不少工人、农民和战士激动地说：我们最敬爱毛主席，是党和毛主席领导我们翻了身，绝不允许反党反社会主义分子污蔑我们伟大的党中央和毛主席！国棉二厂著名的全国先进生产者裔式娟和小组的工人们在座谈时，愈谈愈激动，大家情不自禁地唱起《大海航行靠舵手》的歌曲，来表达她们对伟大领袖毛主席的敬爱。
    在上海第三钢铁厂的座谈会上，被称为上海工人中的“铁人”陈富，一面痛斥邓拓这伙人的罪行，一面控诉旧社会的罪恶。解放前，他的父亲扛活累死了，哥哥在黄浦江淹死了，母亲生活不下去，撞死了。陈富激愤地说：“我们的江山，不准坏蛋碰一碰！”曾经严重烧伤、被党千方百计救活的丘财康，激动万分地说：“我的皮肤是党和人民给的，我的血液是党和人民给的，我的生命是党和毛主席给的。邓拓这小子污蔑我们伟大的党和毛主席，我和他拼了！”上海农业劳动模范季德章，在旧社会曾经扛过多年长工。他在座谈会上，激动地谈了解放以后贫下中农在政治上、生活上的深刻变化，他说：“我们农民挖毒草，向来都挖老根；这次不把邓拓这一伙的老根挖出来，决不罢休！”广大工人、农民和战士决心在这场斗争中，把毛泽东思想举得高高的，把眼睛擦得亮亮的，把笔头磨得尖尖的，彻底摧毁这一伙黑帮！
      用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大工农兵群众，在这场斗争中立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，发言、写文章针锋相对，一针见血，高屋建瓴，气势很盛。这是这场斗争中又一个不同寻常的气象。工农兵群众运用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大学说，对这场斗争的严重意义和“三家村”集团有组织、有领导、有计划进攻的性质，作了深刻的剖析。他们说：“这场不拿枪的斗争，是一场激烈的、复杂的、长期的你死我活的阶级斗争。”“这是关系到能不能建成社会主义、走向共产主义的大事，是关系到世界革命前途的大事！”他们认定：“邓拓这伙人是帝国主义和现代修正主义的内线。”“帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，是国际上反对我们的‘三家村’；邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙这一伙，是国内反对我们的‘三家村’。两个‘三家村’，一明一暗，一唱一和，妄想变天！”“《前线》《北京日报》等报刊，玩弄假揭露、真包庇，假批判、真掩护，企图帮邓拓这伙黑帮混过去，绝对办不到！”“不管‘三家村’这一股妖风，是从阴沟洞里吹出来的，是从防空洞里钻出来的；不管你们这些毒蛇，是什么颜色，披的什么外衣，我们要统统把你们一扫光！”大庆式先进单位德新冶炼厂工人出身的党支部书记陈鑫煜，一周之内连写了三篇反击文章，他一层一层剥下邓拓这一伙人的皮，把“三家村”集团的阴险毒辣的反动面目，暴露在光天化日之下。
      上海广大工农兵群众，用大跃进以来的亲身实践，摆出他们在伟大的三大革命运动中创造的奇迹，痛斥邓拓这一伙污蔑大跃进是“吹牛”、“说大话”、“在实际的事物面前碰得头破血流”等谬论，驳得邓拓这一伙体无完肤。上海工人阶级从一九五八年以来，一直高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持总路线，坚持彻底革命精神。就是在我国经济遭受暂时困难、邓拓这一伙躲在耗子洞里咒骂太阳的时候，上海工人阶级继续坚持发扬革命精神，大踏步前进。这些年来他们把钢铁工业的生产推上一个新的高度，把机械、仪表制造技术提高到一个新的水平，占领了一个又一个新的工业生产领域，搞出了许多精密、尖端的产品。上海工人阶级首创了双水内冷汽轮发电机，制造了世界上少有的万吨水压机、高精度半自动万能外圆磨床、高出率电动机等等。上海工业面貌发生了巨大的变化。上海郊区农民和工人并肩前进，把人民公社越办越好，八年来农业生产持续地稳步地增长。上海的工农兵激愤地质问邓拓这一伙：你们的眼睛瞎了吗？你们恶毒的攻击，怀的什么鬼胎？
    广大干部和革命知识分子，也以极大的革命热情，参加战斗。前一时期，他们就政治和业务的关系进行了深入的讨论。当前这场严重的阶级斗争，使他们具体地、深刻地感受到为什么要突出政治。许多青年知识分子，表示这样的决心：要听毛主席的话，坚决走与工农兵相结合的道路，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己，做无产阶级的革命接班人；要在这场斗争中经风雨，见世面，锻炼自己，改造自己，彻底摧毁邓拓这一伙企图毒害青年，搞“和平演变”的阴谋。高等学校有些即将毕业的学生，看到邓拓在《燕山夜话》中，散布“父女相依为命”，“不宜离家远行”的毒素，激起了无比的愤恨，他们立即向党组织表示：我们是工农子弟，是革命的后代，我们要紧紧跟着党和毛主席走。我们快要毕业了，我们坚决要求到农村去，到山区去，到党最需要的一切地方去，我们就是要“离家远行”！
    在这场斗争中，一支由工农兵群众、干部和革命知识分子组成的文化理论队伍，正在迅速形成和不断壮大。在江南造船厂，现在已有四百人组成了二十个战斗小组；在求新造船厂，全厂职工或集体或个人，几天内就写出了五百四十多篇批判邓拓这一伙的文章。在高等院校，学生们也纷纷组成业余写作小组，不少青年教师和学生们同在一个写作组里，共同战斗。广大工农兵群众、干部和革命知识分子，集中火力猛烈痛击“三家村”黑店；又带着革命激情，创作歌颂党、歌颂毛主席、抒发工农兵英雄豪情的诗歌、舞蹈、剧本等作品。上海第三钢铁厂有几千钢铁工人和干部，参加讨论修改工厂编写的反映工人赶超先进水平斗争的话剧。他们说，一定要把这个剧本写好、改好，把它作为一颗重炮弹，回击那些反党反社会主义的“权威”和“专家”！
    这支由工农兵群众、干部和革命知识分子组成的文化理论队伍的出现，显示着一个不可抗拒的趋势：反动资产阶级的“权威”、“专家”的偶象，一定要被打倒！被窃取的文化界的领导权，一定要统统夺回来，工农兵一定要占领全部文化阵地！
    上海广大工农兵群众、干部和革命知识分子，牢记着毛主席的教导，认识到这场阶级斗争是长期的，复杂的，曲折的，现在斗争刚刚开始。他们下定决心，把社会主义文化大革命进行到底，彻底捣毁“三家村”，扫除一切害人精！
