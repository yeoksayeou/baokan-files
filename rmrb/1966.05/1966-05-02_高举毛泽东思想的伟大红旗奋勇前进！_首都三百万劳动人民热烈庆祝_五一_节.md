    The Albanian Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Shehu, accompanied by Chinese Party and state leaders including Soong Ching Ling, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping, came to the Working People's Cultural Palace today to celebrate the festival with the laboring people of the capital. They were warmly welcomed by the people of the capital everywhere they went. Tens of thousands of people, with strong proletarian internationalist feelings, paid the most sincere and highest respect to comrades and comrades-in-arms standing at the forefront of the struggle against U.S. imperialism and against modern revisionism. People excitedly cheered again and again, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the militant friendship between the great peoples of China and Albania!"

At various celebration venues, the masses participating in the gathering and friends from more than sixty countries and regions on five continents warmly congratulated each other, watched performances together, and sang and danced together. The people of the capital used a large number of propaganda posters, slogans, and militant literary and artistic programs to express to friends from all countries the firm determination of the Chinese people to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and to resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries in the world. Together with foreign friends, they continuously shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "U.S. imperialism get out of Vietnam! Get out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America! Get out of all the places it has invaded!"
     "Highlight politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything!" "Study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, and take Chairman Mao's writings as the supreme instruction for all tasks!" This is the loudest voice in the entire activity of the people of the capital celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day this year. Thousands of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and cadres of government organizations and other industries, raised red flags, beat gongs and drums, and used self-edited and self-performed programs to enthusiastically praise the great victories achieved by Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts, and praised workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, creating a new era in which workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism. Many activists in studying Chairman Mao's works from among workers, peasants, and soldiers met spiritedly at various celebration venues today. They performed programs together, talked heartily, exchanged experiences, encouraged each other, and expressed a common wish: "Study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime and do revolution for a lifetime."
    The capital's workers, taking the Daqing people as a learning model, today sang spiritedly: "The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is raised high, the pace of revolution never stops, catch up with Daqing, surpass Daqing, Daqing flowers bloom all over the land," they celebrated the festival with the good news of production in the first four months of this year. The Working People's Cultural Palace, the center of workers' activities, was filled with the sound of drums and a joyous atmosphere. The red flag list of advanced deeds of Daqing-style enterprises and some large propaganda posters that attracted special attention reflected the revolutionary spirit of the capital's workers of self-reliance, hard work, and striving to catch up with the world's advanced level. Employees of Beijing's three Daqing-style enterprises—Shigang Iron and Steel Plant, Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, and Liulihe Cement Plant—who participated in the get-together, together with employees from various industries such as machinery, chemical industry, light industry, and railways, brought good news of the vigorous development of production and construction: since the beginning of this year, the capital's industrial front has highlighted politics, the production level has been comprehensively improved, and new leaps have occurred in product quality and variety. The workers of Jingxi Coal Mine, who completed the coal mining plan ahead of schedule, specially came from sixty li outside the city to join in the get-together today. They performed "Miner's Dance" and "Miner's War Song", reflecting the miners' living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought to produce more coal for the country. Many well-known advanced producers and the majority of employees in various industrial systems gathered here to jointly celebrate, express their determination to each other, and further carry out the mass movement of comparing, learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing under the command of Mao Zedong Thought, and to develop Beijing's industrial construction at a high level and high speed, and strive to complete and over fulfill the Third Five-Year Plan.
    On Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace, surrounded by red flags, the huge slogan "Long Live the People's Commune" floated in the sky with colorful balloons. Commune members who came from the front line of spring plowing and production held a grand gathering with workers, PLA soldiers, and young students by the mountain and lake. The commune members joyfully stepped on the music of "Learn from Dazhai, Catch up with Dazhai" and sang songs such as "Dare to Teach the Sun and Moon to Change to a New Sky." Some well-known agricultural labor models, five-good commune members, five-good employees, and five-good soldiers toured the park in groups. They appreciated the festive scenery together in the Long Corridor, talked heartily, and encouraged each other. They talked freely about the excellent situation and new people and new things that have emerged in the rural areas of Beijing suburbs during the great socialist education movement. The commune members are determined to become a national Dazhai-style model in the suburbs of Beijing, continue to revolutionize, and strive for greater leaps forward in agriculture. In the gathering circle of Yongfengtun Commune and Tsinghua University, urban educated youth who have settled in the countryside and college students who "come from the commune and go back to the commune" appeared. These young people expressed their determination to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, be a new type of socialist peasant, and work hard to build a new socialist countryside with the songs and dances they performed.
    The vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers performed thousands of revolutionary literary and artistic programs in various celebration venues, reflecting the new look of our country's socialist cultural revolution, and the new era in which workers, peasants, and soldiers have stepped onto the stage of culture and art has begun. The various literary and artistic programs such as songs, dances, recitations, dramas, and Quyi, which they self-edited and self-performed, praised the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts. People who celebrated the festival in the rain, although their clothes were wet with rain, still enthusiastically sang and danced. "Daqing Family Members Make Revolution" performed by family members of Daqing Oilfield, "Song of Daqing" performed by workers in the capital, "Ten Learn from Dazhai" performed by commune members in the suburbs of Beijing, "Chairman Mao's Soldiers Listen Most to the Party" performed by PLA soldiers, and "Give U.S. Imperialism a Big Punch" performed by Young Pioneers, etc., were all warmly welcomed by the people. Literary and artistic workers from the capital and other places performed excellent revolutionary literary and artistic dramas such as the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," and the modern Peking operas "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang" during the festival. The literary and artistic performances of these festival activities vividly show that the vast number of literary and artistic workers can only serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve proletarian politics if they follow Chairman Mao's teachings, promote proletarian ideology in a big way, and eliminate bourgeois ideology in a big way.
    Cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and militiamen from all walks of life who have achieved major victories and outstanding achievements in combat and training joined in the gathering. They showed everywhere the high-spirited fighting spirit of "strengthening national defense and preparing to smash U.S. imperialist aggression at any time" and "we must liberate Taiwan." Mai Xiande's comrades, who won combat exploits by sinking the U.S.-made Chiang warships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" in naval battles last year, also participated in the celebration activities in the capital. They said that they would better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way and strive for new victories in defending the motherland and opposing U.S. imperialist aggression. Militiamen performed many songs and dances in the celebration activities that reflected their spirit of learning from the PLA's constant preparedness. A group of female militiamen raised their guns and bravely stabbed, performing "Female Militia Dance," and sang in unison: "The whole people are soldiers in the big ocean, setting up a dragnet and a ground net, if the enemy dares to invade, eliminate it completely!"
    Representatives of dozens of ethnic groups from all over the country, as well as returned overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao who have returned from five continents around the world, also celebrated the great victory of the world's working people's anti-imperialist struggle and celebrated the prosperity of the motherland together with the people of the capital with infinite love for the motherland and the Party today. Wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by the crowds. When overseas Chinese students from the Art Department of Huaqiao University who returned to the embrace of the motherland from Indonesia joyfully performed various programs in the colorful Beihai Park to praise the great motherland and the great Party, they did not forget their relatives who are being cruelly persecuted by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia. They angrily condemned the crimes of the Indonesian right-wing fascist thugs. They also performed the newly created dialogue "Diplomatic Warrior Zhao Xiaoshou," enthusiastically praising Zhao Xiaoshou, a foreign affairs worker in our country, for his heroic struggle with bare hands to defend the five-star red flag in the face of the attack of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. They also expressed their determination to learn from Zhao Xiaoshou's revolutionary spirit of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not being afraid of violence, and daring to struggle.
    At night, Tiananmen Square was brightly lit, red flags fluttered, gongs and drums were loud, and there was joy everywhere. People sang heartily and danced hand in hand. At about eight o'clock, there was a string of sounds, a trail of light rose into the air, and clusters of fireworks filled the night sky. The joy of the whole scene reached its climax. People celebrated the prosperity of the socialist motherland and the great friendship and fighting unity of the people of the world.
