    The Hidden Black Goods Cannot Be Concealed
    Chen Zhaoji, Young Teacher of Chinese Department, Zhongshan University
    Deng Tuo compiled and published "Yanshan Night Talks," peddling a lot of black talk. However, he also hid three articles, all of which were anti-Party and anti-socialist black goods. And the editorial departments of "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily," under the banner of criticizing "Yanshan Night Talks," helped Deng Tuo hide the black goods, not mentioning these three articles at all.
    Deng Tuo's black talk has been exposed, and the black goods in the "Three-Family Village" black shop, with Deng Tuo as the shopkeeper, have been shaken out. Deng Tuo, with a guilty conscience, hid three articles when he compiled and published "Yanshan Night Talks." These are "The Case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng," published in "Beijing Evening News" on June 22, 1961, "A Pigeon is Called a Pigeon," published on July 13, 1961, and "This Year's Spring Festival," published on February 4, 1962. What exactly are these three articles, that Deng Tuo insisted on hiding them? Now, let's take a look!
    "The Case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng" introduces such a case: Chen Jiang, a Jinshi of the Song Dynasty, served as an official in Fujian, "said to be corrupt and illegal, with a notorious reputation." Empress Dowager Mingsu, who was listening to politics, ordered Prime Minister Wang Yi to investigate, and Wang Yi sent Wang Geng to Fujian. Unexpectedly, Wang Geng, because his son had been bribed, "rashly announced dozens of crimes of the Prime Minister," "but after verifying the facts, he realized that these dozens of articles were deliberately exaggerated and fabricated," "Empress Dowager Mingsu was furious and ordered Wang Geng to be imprisoned as well, so the case was further expanded in scope and more complicated in content."
    Why in 1961, when right-leaning opportunists stirred up a reversal-of-verdicts wind, did Deng Tuo bring up this case? He announced at the beginning of the article that it was to "open people's minds." Open what minds? He said at the end of the article: "As long as you use a calm and objective attitude and carefully analyze the main plot of this case, it is not difficult to discover its expansion and complication." Isn't this blatant cooperation with the reversal-of-verdicts wind, insinuating that our struggle against right-leaning opportunists was "expanded and complicated"?
    Why would it be "expanded and complicated"? Deng Tuo led people's thinking down to say: "There is an important reason, that is, during the period when Empress Dowager Mingsu listened to the court in the Song Dynasty, the administration of officials had become increasingly corrupt. The higher-ups did not have shrewd and capable prime ministers and their subordinates to be earnestly responsible in employing and administering personnel; the local officials below did whatever they wanted." Isn't this attacking the responsible comrades of our Party Central Committee, saying that they did not employ "shrewd and capable prime ministers," attacking our cadres at all levels for "doing whatever they wanted," which led to "expansion and complication"?
    The opening sentences of this article are also very noteworthy. Deng Tuo said that this case was seen in Wei Tai's "Dongxuan Notes" of the Song Dynasty, and he felt that this book "has partial and excessive praise for Wang Anshi's New Laws, and also has many inappropriate criticisms of the Yuanyou Party (Note: a group of people who opposed Wang Anshi's New Laws at that time)." These two sentences point out Deng Tuo's intention in writing this article. We know that in the article "Learn More, Criticize Less," Deng Tuo used Wang Anshi as a target, attacking so-called "great politicians" who "have many innovative ideas but lack practical knowledge and experience in handling affairs," saying that he "has many ideas that are unrealistic." Now, Deng Tuo is bringing up Wang Anshi's New Laws again, saying "there are partial and excessive praises for Wang Anshi's New Laws." What Deng Tuo called "partial and excessive praise" for, is it really "Wang Anshi's New Laws"? No, discerning people can see at a glance that what he called "partial and excessive praise" for is the proletariat's new laws, the Communist Party's new laws, the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, the People's Commune, and other new creations of our people. In his view, these "new laws" carried out by our people under the leadership of the Party are all "unrealistic" and "partially and excessively praised." What Deng Tuo called "many inappropriate criticisms of the Yuanyou Party" is actually attacking our counterattack against right-leaning opportunists as being "excessive" and "wrong." Here, isn't Deng Tuo's reactionary face of opposing the Party and socialism, and shouting injustice for right-leaning opportunists, very clear?
    Just twenty days after the publication of "The Case of Chen Jiang and Wang Geng," Deng Tuo published "A Pigeon is Called a Pigeon," further clarifying his thinking against "new laws." In this article, Deng Tuo, under the pretext of opposing giving pigeons strange names, sarcastically said: "In the final analysis, everything has its original name, with a certain meaning, which people are very familiar with, so don't create new names and fabricate new ones." We say that creating new things is also a law of class struggle. Without creating new things, there will be no development, no revolution. The proletarian revolution must create the newness of the proletariat, establish the otherness of socialism, and completely eliminate the bourgeois and feudal culture that "people are very familiar with." Deng Tuo opposes "new laws," opposes "creating new things," isn't it opposing revolution, opposing socialism? Isn't it妄想 to rely on the "Three-Family Village" black shop to subvert our proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, starting first from the ideological field?
    "This Year's Spring Festival" is another big poisonous weed hidden by Deng Tuo. This article is superficially about introducing the customs of celebrating the Spring Festival. However, he did not use the ready-made title "The Customs of the Spring Festival," but marked it as "This Year's Spring Festival." This is by no means accidental. Deng Tuo wants to emphasize the word "this year." What is the Spring Festival like "this year" (1962)? Deng Tuo said: "The severe winter brought by the north wind is about to end, and it will be replaced by the warm east wind, the earth will soon thaw, and everything will be vibrant and prosperous." Is this a description of natural scenery? No, this is an estimate of the political situation at that time. When the Spring Festival of 1962 came, wasn't it when the "Three-Family Village" black shop was booming and all kinds of monsters and demons in society were emerging? At this time, what Deng Tuo said about "the severe winter is about to end," what he said about "the earth will soon 'thaw'," what he said about "replacing it," isn't the implication very obvious?
    However, relying solely on a few "old brothers" and "old younger brothers" to "replace it" is still too weak. So, Deng Tuo took the opportunity to talk about the customs of the Spring Festival and openly came out to sow discord between the Party and the people, especially the relationship between the Party and the 500 million peasants, and incite the people to rise up against the Party.
    Please see, what kind of Spring Festival customs did Deng Tuo introduce? In 1962, it was precisely when we encountered three consecutive years of severe natural disasters, but Deng Tuo talked a lot about the customs of "eating." What "in many places, peasant families, regardless of men, women, old or young, eat spring pancakes on this day," what "in many places, they also eat a kind of 'sticky cake'," what "especially in most areas of the north, on New Year's Eve in the lunar calendar, they must steam enough馒头 to eat for a few days, called 'Ten Thousand Years of Grain'." Then, he took the opportunity to elaborate, and actually said that steaming enough 馒头 to eat for a few days, "the meaning of doing this is to ensure that there is surplus grain every year, which can not only store grain and prevent disasters, but also make everyone well-fed and the country prosperous." This is a complete nonsense. Obviously, "steaming enough 馒头 to eat for a few days," even if it contains the prayer of "surplus grain every year," where does it relate to "storing grain to prevent disasters," and where does it relate to "everyone being well-fed and the country being prosperous"?
    Why should things that cannot be related be forcibly related together? Deng Tuo then said: "Now we see that this point (referring to the so-called 'Ten Thousand Years of Grain') is particularly important. If there can be a reserve similar to 'Ten Thousand Years of Grain', then, no matter when, where will there be any food difficulties?" Originally, the focus of this passage is on this sentence!
    Then, Deng Tuo said: "The people of our country have always attached great importance to grain reserves, and the grain storage system has become one of the most important systems of successive governments. In places where there is insufficient national grain, there are also some 'righteous granaries' and other reserves among the people as self-preparation and supplementation. In order to enrich the granaries, the ruling classes of the past dynasties also often had words such as 'cultivating three and leaving one' or 'cultivating two and leaving one' in their exhortations to agriculture. ... This kind of idea and intention still has something to be taken, and cannot be completely dismissed." Well, Deng Tuo's face is fully exposed here. It turns out that the people are good, and the previous governments and systems are also good, but the current government and system are not good, otherwise, "where will there be any food difficulties?" Please think about it, isn't Deng Tuo here taking advantage of our temporary food difficulties to sow discord between the Party and the people, and incite the people to rise up against the Party, so that Deng Tuo and his gang can "rise up and replace it"?
    From this, it can be seen that Deng Tuo's three articles are all anti-Party declarations, and Deng Tuo hid these three articles because he had a guilty conscience. The editorial departments of "Qianxian" and "Beijing Daily," under the banner of criticizing "Yanshan Night Talks," helped Deng Tuo hide the black goods, not mentioning these three articles at all. What exactly these two editorial departments are doing is also very clear. We must shout loudly: No hiding black goods! Since you dare to open a black shop and dare to sell black goods, you should dare to take out all your black goods! Hiding cannot be hidden; slipping cannot be slipped through. We must dig out your bottom line!

    藏不住的黑货
    中山大学中文系青年教师　陈兆集
    邓拓把《燕山夜话》编集出版，贩卖了许多黑话。但是，他还藏起了三篇文章，这些也都是反党反社会主义的黑货。而《前线》和《北京日报》编辑部，打着批判《燕山夜话》的旗帜，帮着邓拓藏匿黑货，对这三篇文章只字不提。
    邓拓的黑话给揭出来了，以邓拓为掌柜的“三家村”黑店里的黑货给抖出来了。邓拓做贼心虚，当他把《燕山夜话》编集出版时，藏起了三篇文章。这就是《北京晚报》一九六一年六月二十二日发表的《陈绛和王耿的案件》，一九六一年七月十三日发表的《鸽子就叫做鸽子》，和一九六二年二月四日发表的《今年的春节》。这三篇文章究竟是什么货色，邓拓偏要把它藏起来呢？现在，就来看一看吧！
    《陈绛和王耿的案件》介绍了这样一个案子：宋朝进士陈绛在福建做官，“据说贪赃枉法，声名狼籍”。临朝听政的明肃太后叫宰相王沂公查办，王沂公派王耿去福建。不料王耿因为自己的儿子受了贿赂，“冒冒失失地宣布了丞相的几十条罪状”，“可是一核对事实，才知道这几十条都是故意夸大和捏造的”，“明肃太后大怒，下令把王耿也关进了牢狱，于是这个案件更加扩大了范围，内容也更加复杂了”。
    为什么在一九六一年，正当右倾机会主义分子刮起一股翻案风时，邓拓要搬出这件案子来呢？他在文章的开头就宣告，为的是“可以打开人的思路”。打开什么思路呢？他在文章的结尾说：“只要用冷静客观的态度，仔细分析这个案件的主要情节，都不难发现它的扩大化和复杂化。”这难道不是明目张胆地配合翻案风，影射我们对右倾机会主义分子的斗争“扩大化和复杂化”了吗？
    为什么会“扩大化和复杂化”呢？邓拓把人的思路引下去说：“有一个重要的原因，这是宋代政府在明肃太后临朝期间，吏治已经日趋腐败。上边用人行政没有精明强干的宰相和他的僚属认真负责；下边的地方官吏为所欲为。”这难道不是攻击我们党中央的负责同志，说他们没有起用“精明强干的宰相”，攻击我们的各级干部“为所欲为”以致才“扩大化和复杂化”了吗？
    这篇文章的开头几句也很值得注意。邓拓说，这个案子是从宋代魏泰的《东轩笔录》上看到的，他觉得这部书“对王安石的新法有片面颂扬过火的地方，对于元祐党人（注：当时反对王安石新法的一伙人）也有许多不恰当的责难”。这两句话，点明了邓拓写这篇文章的用意。我们知道，邓拓在《多学少评》一文中，拿王安石做靶子，攻击过“有许多革新思想，但是缺少实际知识和办事的经验”的所谓“大政治家”，说他“有许多想法是不切实际的”。现在，邓拓又抬出王安石的新法来，说“对王安石的新法有片面颂扬过火的地方”。邓拓所谓“片面颂扬过火”了的，真是“王安石的新法”吗？不，明眼人一眼就能看穿，他所谓“片面颂扬过火”了的，是无产阶级的新法，是共产党的新法，是总路线、大跃进、人民公社等我国人民新的创举。在他看来，我国人民在党领导下行的这些“新法”，都是“不切实际的”，是“片面颂扬过火”了。邓拓所谓“对于元祐党人也有许多不恰当的责难”，实际上就是攻击我们对于右倾机会主义分子的反击是“过火了”，“搞错了”。这里，邓拓反党反社会主义、为右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈的反动面目，不是很清楚了吗？
    就在《陈绛和王耿的案件》一文发表二十天后，邓拓又发表了《鸽子就叫做鸽子》一文，进一步挑明了他反对“新法”的思想。在这篇文章中，邓拓借口反对给鸽子起奇怪的名称，含沙射影地说：“归根到底，凡物有其本名，有一定的含意，人们都很熟悉了，就不要标新立异，杜撰新名。”我们说，标新立异，也是阶级斗争的一条规律。不标新，不立异，就没有发展，就没有革命，无产阶级革命，一定要标无产阶级之新，立社会主义之异，彻底消灭“人们都很熟悉了”的资产阶级和封建主义的文化。邓拓反对“新法”，反对“标新立异”，不就是反对革命，反对社会主义吗？不就是妄想凭借“三家村”黑店，首先从意识形态领域开始，颠覆我们的无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义吗？
    《今年的春节》是邓拓藏起来的另一株大毒草。这篇文章表面上是介绍过春节的风俗。可是，他却没有用《春节的风俗》这个现成的题目，而标为《今年的春节》。这决不是偶然的。邓拓要着重点明的正是这“今年”两字。“今年”（一九六二年）的春节怎么样呢？邓拓说：“北风带来的严寒季节就要结束了，代之而起的将是和暖的东风，大地很快就要解冻了，万物都将朝气勃勃，欣欣向荣。”这难道是对自然景象的描写吗？不是的，这是对当时政治形势的估计。一九六二年春节来到的时候，不正是“三家村”这个黑店生意兴隆，社会上的牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼的时候吗？这时，邓拓说什么“严寒季节就要结束了”，说什么“大地很快就要‘解冻’了”，说什么“代之而起”，寓意不是十分明显的吗？
    然而，单靠几位“老兄”、“老弟”，就要“代之而起”，毕竟力量太单薄了。于是，邓拓借着谈春节的风俗，公开出来挑拨党和人民的关系，特别是党和五亿农民的关系，煽动人民起来反党。
    请看，邓拓介绍了一些什么样的春节的风俗呢？一九六二年，正是我们遇到连续三年严重自然灾害的时候，邓拓却大谈起“吃”的风俗来。什么“许多地方的农民家庭，无论男女老幼，在春节这一天都要吃春盘”，什么“有许多地方还要吃一种‘粘糕’”，什么“特别是在北方大部分地区，阴历除夕还必须蒸好够几天吃的馒头，叫做‘万年粮’”。接着，他就借题发挥，居然说蒸好够几天吃的馒头，“这样做的意思是保证年年有余粮，不但可以储备粮食，防止灾荒，而且可以使人人足食，国家富强”。这真是一派胡言。明明是“蒸好够几天吃的馒头”，就算寓有“年年有余粮”的祈愿，哪里扯得上“储备粮食，防止灾荒”，又哪里扯得到“人人足食，国家富强”上去？
    为什么要把扯不上的事情硬扯到一块呢？邓拓接着就说了：“现在看到，这一点（指所谓“万年粮”）尤其重要。如果能够有类似‘万年粮’的储备，那么，无论什么时候，哪里还会有什么粮食困难呢？”原来，这段文章的重点作在这一句话上！
    接着，邓拓说：“我国人民历来都很重视粮食的储备，粮仓制度成为历代政府最重要的制度之一。在国家粮食不足的地方，民间还有一些‘义仓’等作自备和补充。为了充实粮仓，历代的统治阶级在劝农的文告中，也常常有‘耕三余一’或‘耕二余一’等话。……这种设想和用意仍有可取之处，不可一概抹煞。”好了，邓拓的面目在这里充分暴露了。原来，人民是好的，以前的政府和制度也是好的，就是现在的政府和制度不好，否则，“哪里还会有什么粮食困难呢？”请大家想一想，邓拓在这里不是借着我们暂时的粮食困难，挑拨党和人民的关系，煽动人民起来反党，好让邓拓这批黑帮“起而代之”吗？
    由此可见，邓拓的这三篇文章，都是反党的宣言，邓拓所以把这三篇文章藏起来，是心里有鬼的。《前线》和《北京日报》编辑部，打着批判《燕山夜话》的旗帜，帮着邓拓藏匿黑货，对这三篇文章只字不提。这两个编辑部究竟是干什么的，也就一清二楚了。我们要大喝一声：不准匿藏黑货！你们既然敢开黑店，敢贩黑货，就应该敢把你们的黑货全部拿出来！藏，是藏不住的；滑，是滑不过去的。我们一定要把你们的老底挖出来！
