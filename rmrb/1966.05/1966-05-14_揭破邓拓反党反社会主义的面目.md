    Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, should be criticized and must not be allowed to spread freely."

    During the period from 1959 to 1962, due to the temporary economic difficulties our country encountered, dregs momentarily floated to the surface, evil things emerged to create trouble, and ghosts and monsters all appeared on the stage, launching a frenzied attack against the Party and socialism. We must expose them all from the dark corners and let them be paraded in broad daylight.

    Class struggle is bound to be reflected within the Party, and the bourgeois agents within the Party are bound to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities from within the proletarian party. Deng Tuo was one of the figures who launched a frenzied attack against the Party and socialism.

    Deng Tuo is the owner of the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" black inn. Over the past few years, Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han and others have launched a major offensive against the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and against socialism in a guided, organized, and planned manner.

    On April 16, the *Beijing Daily* published a batch of materials so-called criticizing "Three-Family Village" and *Yanshan Night Talks*, and added a note from the editorial departments of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily*. Both the note and the compiled materials on *Yanshan Night Talks* tried their best to cover up the fundamental issue of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist nature. This was using criticism as a cover, carrying out protection in the name of struggle, and engaging in shielding activities.

    Whether Deng Tuo and others were leading, organizing, and planning to oppose the Party and socialism is a major issue of right and wrong that cannot be blurred. Being vague on this fundamental issue is tantamount to shielding bad people. The anti-Party and anti-socialist face of Deng Tuo and others must be thoroughly exposed and resolutely criticized.

      The clowns leaped around, viciously attacking our
  Great Party Central Committee

    The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The great victories of our country's revolution and construction are all due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the respected Chairman Mao. Therefore, all class enemies at home and abroad always direct their attacks first at the great Chinese Communist Party.

    On February 22, 1962, Deng Tuo published "Is Wisdom Reliable?". Who is the target of this essay?

    Deng Tuo vigorously discussed the so-called emperors listening to the opinions of the people. He said that Kuang Heng had once advised Emperor Yuan of Han to "seek wide counsel from the masses"; the famous scholar Zheng Xing had also advised Emperor Guangwu of Han to "broadly seek counsel and accept the strategies of his subordinates." After listing how the ancient emperors and generals humbly accepted the opinions of their "subordinates," Deng Tuo commented sarcastically, "These ancient people's views were very good. In particular, Fan Yaofu's saying 'do not necessarily devise your own plans' is especially worthy of attention. Some people often like to show off their abilities, act clever, look down on the masses, and always want to come up with their own ideas, trying to win by surprise, instead of accepting the good opinions of the masses below."

    First of all, it is a complete distortion of historical facts to believe that feudal emperors and generals could accept the opinions of the masses. The "masses" and "subordinates" that Kuang Heng and Zheng Xing referred to when asking the Han emperors to listen to opinions, meant the opinions of bureaucrats such as prime ministers and ministers. To say that emperors and generals of the landlord class could listen to the opinions of the masses is something with ulterior motives.

    Second, Deng Tuo tirelessly preached about Kuang Heng and Zheng Xing wanting Emperor Yuan and Guangwu of Han to "adopt the strategies of their subordinates." What exactly does this mean? Who were the so-called "subordinates" here? Who did Emperor Yuan and Guangwu of Han refer to? People will naturally think of Wu Han's words in *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*: "You are self-righteous, refuse criticism, you have too many mistakes." Deng Tuo's saying "likes to show off his abilities, act clever, and look down on the masses" is a further elaboration of Wu Han's *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*. The "masses" that Deng Tuo refers to are the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspirators of Deng Tuo's ilk, while the Emperor Yuan and Guangwu of Han that he refers to are the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.

    Third, Deng Tuo attacked our Party for "attempting to win by surprise." Revolution is about winning by surprise. The era of revolution is the era of the proletarian party leading millions of people to create miracles. Rightists once attacked our Party Central Committee for "being fond of greatness and eager for success." Before the anti-Rightist struggle, in May 1957, Deng Tuo himself attacked our Party Central Committee for "being greedy for greatness and eager for success." It is evident how much he hates the victory of the socialist revolutionary cause. The proletariat and the working masses sing the praises of the Party and the great leader of the Party, precisely because they are singing the praises of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause. In contrast, Deng Tuo, Wu Han and others, who despise the working masses, try their best to praise emperors and generals, and the heads of the exploiting classes, viciously cursing the proletarian party.

    In the essay "The 'Great Empty Words'," Deng Tuo even more blatantly attacked the great Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Tuo said, "'The East Wind prevails over the West Wind' is our benefactor, and the West Wind is our enemy" is "great empty words," "useless" "clichés," and "the more you say it, the worse it gets."

      "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is Chairman Mao's famous thesis on the international situation. Comrade Mao Zedong said at the meeting of communist and workers' parties of various countries in 1957: "I believe that the characteristic of the current situation is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, that is to say, the socialist forces have an overwhelming advantage over the imperialist forces." "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is a scientific conclusion drawn by analyzing the comparison of international class forces at the current stage using Marxism-Leninism. This scientific conclusion is the spiritual atomic bomb of the revolutionary people of various countries. It is increasingly being grasped by the broad revolutionary people, greatly inspiring and continuing to inspire the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed and exploited people all over the world. This scientific conclusion hit the vital points of imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and Khrushchev revisionism, making them tremble with fear. For imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and Khrushchev revisionists, it is indeed true that the more we publicize it, the worse it gets for them. If it were really a "useless" empty word, then why would revisionists like Deng Tuo oppose it so desperately?

    Deng Tuo thought that these curses were not enough to vent the bourgeois hatred in his heart that was hostile to our Party. On July 25, 1962, he published an essay called "Specializing in 'Amnesia'" in *Frontline*. In this article, he used the most vicious language to attack the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, scolding our Party for "going back on its word," "not keeping its promises," and "feigning madness and foolishness, unworthy of trust." This article is full of black talk. Since it is "black talk," it is of course unable to see the sun, so Deng Tuo asserted that this was an article about talking about medical treatment. This is a monstrous lie! Let us peel off the skin and take a look.

    The article cited a story from *Aizi Houyu*, which said that there was a person in the State of Qi who suffered from amnesia and asked Aizi, who was "humorous and intelligent," to treat him. Just a few dozen steps out of his house, he could not recognize his own house or his own wife, and he could not even recognize the stool he had just left. Deng Tuo said that this was "a typical case of amnesia." This is really too deceitful! *Aizi Houyu* is clearly a political satire, how can it be talking about medical treatment? This book "has implied meanings," "satirizes the times," and "admonishes contemporary politics." Deng Tuo certainly knew that *Aizi Houyu* was an article that "satirizes the times" and "admonishes contemporary politics," but he called a stag a horse, saying that it was "a typical case of amnesia"!

    *Frontline* magazine is the theoretical publication of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Why did it suddenly publish an article specifically on treating amnesia? Deng Tuo, who was the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and in charge of theoretical propaganda, why did he "break out" and become a "doctor"? Since he was practicing medicine, why did he not treat diseases such as colds, dysentery, and typhoid fever, but "specialize" in amnesia? Is it because "amnesia" had become a serious epidemic affecting people's health at that time, so that *Frontline* needed to publish a special article, and Deng Tuo had to come to the "front line" to specialize in treatment?

      "Going back on its word," "not keeping its promises" are political concepts, not medical concepts. As for "feigning madness and foolishness, unworthy of trust," this is even more irrelevant to "amnesia." It is very clear that Deng Tuo is talking about politics here, not medicine.

    Deng Tuo also fabricated so-called "positive" methods for "specializing in amnesia": one is to drench the head with dog's blood; the other is to hit the patient's head with a stick to make him go into shock, and then "awaken" him. After searching through medical books, one cannot find such a secret recipe for specializing in "amnesia" using dog's blood or hitting with sticks. Drenching with dog's blood and hitting with sticks are clearly political tactics, where can they be a prescription for treating disease?

    Deng Tuo actually wanted to drench our Party with dog's blood and hit it with sticks, how vicious this is!

    Just drenching with dog's blood and hitting with sticks is not enough. Deng Tuo, this expert who "specializes in amnesia," also ordered the "patient": "must quickly take complete rest, say nothing, do nothing," and listen to his "high-level doctor's guidance," and "the person with amnesia must not interfere indiscriminately." The "person with amnesia" that Deng Tuo attacked is our great Party. He wants our Party to say nothing, do nothing, and "take complete rest," which is to say that he wants our Party to step down.

    At that time, who were the people who clamored for our Party to step down?

    In 1962, Chiang Kai-shek, under the direction of US imperialism, clamored to counterattack the mainland, and domestic class enemies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists carried out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. At the same time, a wind of individual farming and reversing verdicts was blowing. It was at the moment when this adverse current of domestic and foreign class enemies opposing our Party and socialism was making the most noise, that *Frontline*, the organ of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, published this most vicious article by Deng Tuo, clamoring for our Party to step down.

    Look, Deng Tuo, who was drilling within the Party, coordinated so closely with the class enemies at home and abroad!

    Deng Tuo also viciously attacked the proletarian dictatorship. He used the past to satirize the present, saying that "the way of kings" is to act "according to the prevailing human feelings and social moral standards," and "the way of hegemons" is to "rely on power and act brutally and arbitrarily," saying that "even in ancient times, the way of kings was better than the way of hegemons," and that we should "find lessons from this," and scolding us for "making enemies everywhere, how unpopular." It is very clear that this is an attack on the proletarian dictatorship. We say that in a society where classes and class struggle exist, the "way of kings" and "way of hegemons" spoken of by the exploiting classes are all the dictatorship of the exploiting classes over the people. "The way of kings" and "the way of hegemons" are the two hands with which they ruled the people. What they promoted as "the way of kings" was just a deception of the exploited classes. After we, the proletariat and the working people, overthrew the exploiting classes, we precisely used their own methods to treat them, that is, we wanted to "rely on power," that is, relying on the state machinery and the broad masses of workers and peasants to implement dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. In this situation, Deng Tuo opposed "the way of hegemons" with great fanfare and shouted at the top of his voice to promote "the way of kings," which is opposing the proletarian dictatorship and attempting to restore the bourgeois dictatorship.

    If we compare Deng Tuo's above statements with the reactionary statements of the Khrushchev revisionists, his anti-Party face will be even more exposed.

    Khrushchev revisionists incited: "It is necessary to more bravely and resolutely expose the dogmatic theory about the absurd and unfounded competition of 'West Wind and East Wind'"; Deng Tuo said that "East Wind" and "West Wind" are "clichés."

    Khrushchev revisionists slandered us for "shouting world revolution day and night, shouting down with US imperialism," as "using empty incantations, sonorous words and waving swords made of cardboard"; Deng Tuo said that the slogan "East Wind" is "benefactor" and "West Wind" is "enemy," is "useless" empty talk.

    Khrushchev revisionists used the slogan of opposing "personal cult" to oppose Marxist-Leninist parties and Marxist-Leninists all over the world, and carried out subversive activities against the proletarian state. Deng Tuo, who was hostile to the masses and did not understand what "the wisdom of the masses" was, actually said arrogantly that our Party "relies on its own wisdom" and "does not pay attention to the wisdom of the masses." This is nothing more than repeating the old tune of the Khrushchev revisionists slandering us, and cooperating with the Khrushchev revisionists' subversive activities against us.

    Domestic and foreign enemies carried out subversive activities against us, adopted peaceful evolution methods, and attempted to implement a counter-revolutionary restoration; while Deng Tuo wanted to replace the proletarian dictatorship with the bourgeois dictatorship, wanted our Party to "take complete rest," and let them, these revisionists, take over.

    Deng Tuo is the echo of the Khrushchev revisionists. What Deng Tuo said is what Khrushchev said. What Deng Tuo wanted to do is the activities of restoring capitalism that the Khrushchev revisionists did in the Soviet Union.

      A mayfly trying to shake a big tree, opposing the Party's general line, attacking the Great Leap Forward

    Deng Tuo used the so-called storytelling method to launch one poisonous arrow after another at the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward in essays such as "The Theory of Cherishing Labor Power," "The Scam of Gold and Swords," "The Story of Talking Big," "This Year's Spring Festival," and "Plain Boiled Water is the Best Drink."

    In 1961, Deng Tuo told two foreign fable stories in the *Beijing Evening News*. One was about an athlete who liked to brag, and the other was about a titmouse bragging that it would dry up the sea water.

    At the same time as "Two Foreign Fables," Deng Tuo shot another poisonous arrow at our socialist revolutionary cause: "The Fortune of an Egg."

    The material for this essay was copied from Ming Dynasty writer Jiang Yingke's *Xuetao Novel*. The story is about a person whose entire fortune consisted of a single egg he picked up. This person imagined that the egg would hatch into a chicken, the chicken would lay eggs, he would sell the chickens to buy a cow, the cow would give birth to more cows, multiplying several times, and finally he even planned to take a concubine. As a result, his wife became "extremely angry" and "smashed his entire fortune with one fist."

    After telling this story, Deng Tuo asked: "Don't you think this story can explain many problems?" What exactly does it explain? Deng Tuo continued: Although this person knew that "it would take ten years to earn this fortune," "his plan had no reliable basis at all," "replacing reality with fantasy," "daydreaming," so that "this fortune of one egg was completely destroyed."

    In these so-called "stories," Deng Tuo said three things: (1) The "great plans" of the athlete, the titmouse, and the person with only one egg were all "boasting"; (2) they exaggerated the role of "psychological factors," thinking that they could "do whatever they wanted" based on "psychological factors," and as a result, they "ran into a brick wall in the face of reality," declaring "bankruptcy" and "complete collapse"; (3) after the bragging was exposed, the "deceived people" should not "easily let go of the bragging cheaters."

    Is Deng Tuo really telling a story here? No.

    All fables have implied meanings. The title of the story told by Jiang Yingke is called *Wangxin*, which satirizes those "who have early plans in their minds, hoping for unexpected things," that is, satirizing those who hope to realize their goals sooner and faster. Deng Tuo also repeatedly enlightened readers in the article to understand the real significance of these stories. He said: "If you have the ability to understand by analogy," then "these fables obviously contain profound meanings" and can explain the "many problems" of today; "the facts clearly prove" that "even today, such bragging figures can be encountered anytime and anywhere." He also pointed his finger and said: "Please, did you hear the titmouse bragging? Did you see someone going to a banquet with a spoon?" Look, Deng Tuo is using this challenging tone to announce that the stories he told are purposeful, and his purpose is to attack the Party's general line and attack the Great Leap Forward.

    Under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country demanded to quickly change our country's backward face of poverty and blankness, and to build our country into a socialist modernized power in a not too long historical period. Imperialists once ridiculed us, saying that we were "talking big" and "bragging." When our country suffered temporary economic difficulties, imperialists clamored that China's Great Leap Forward had "failed" and attacked our socialist construction for "collapsing." And the stories told by Deng Tuo are to attack our general line and the Great Leap Forward as "talking big," "boasting," "daydreaming," "replacing reality with fantasy," and as a result, "running into a brick wall" and "destroying" all of their poor belongings.

    What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class says what kind of words. Khrushchev revisionists attacked our general line and the Great Leap Forward as "a dangerous road of experimentation," "subjectivism and voluntarism in the economy," and suffered a "complete failure." Deng Tuo's attack on us is exactly the same as the attack by the Khrushchev revisionists.

    Our Party has already forcefully refuted the shameless slander of domestic and foreign class enemies. Our Party said: Is it impossible for us to build our country into a socialist modernized power with the speed of the Great Leap Forward? Is it bragging and firing cannons? No, it is possible. It is neither bragging nor firing cannons. Just look at our history and you will know. Haven't we basically overthrown the seemingly powerful imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in our country? Haven't we reached a considerable level in all aspects of socialist revolution and socialist construction after more than ten years of hard work from a base of poverty and blankness? Haven't we also exploded the atomic bomb? The emergence of the Great Leap Forward in China is an inevitable trend that cannot be blocked by any reactionary forces.

    Those who "ran into a brick wall" in the face of facts are not us, but the domestic and foreign class enemies, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists, namely revisionists.

    It should be pointed out that Deng Tuo did not just scold the Party's general line and the Great Leap Forward, he stirred up trouble in a fierce manner saying "Now that the boasting has been exposed, the deceived people will never easily let go of the bragging cheaters," that is to say, he wanted to gather ghosts and monsters to overthrow our Party and the proletarian dictatorship. We still have to treat him in the same way he treats us. According to Deng Tuo's own words, now that the face of this political swindler has been exposed by everyone, we must never let him go easily!

      Defending the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office, singing praises to them

    Deng Tuo's above-mentioned remarks attacking the Party and attacking the general line are completely right-leaning opportunist, namely revisionist, remarks. It has now been found that in 1957, before the anti-Rightist struggle, Deng Tuo published many anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois rightist remarks. Deng Tuo is a rightist who slipped through the net. In 1959, he was dismissed from office and removed from the important work he was doing in the *People's Daily*. Deng Tuo cried out for injustice for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office, and at the same time, he was also crying out for injustice for himself.

    After Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* came out, Deng Tuo suddenly felt ancient sorrows and wrote an article *Defending Li Sancai*.

    Deng Tuo said that Li Sancai "is a positive historical figure," and Li Sancai's heroic deeds of "attacking the dark feudal politics" were "buried," which is something that makes people "feel regretful." Deng Tuo not only felt extremely sorry for Li Sancai's so-called injustice, but also became very emotional when he talked about it. Who exactly is Li Sancai, and why did Deng Tuo want to defend him?

    Li Sancai was a bureaucrat during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, who served as the governor of Fengyang and the minister of the Ministry of Revenue. He was a butcher whose hands were stained with the blood of peasant insurgents, a loyal slave of the landlord class, and a mortal enemy of the people, not a "positive figure" at all.

    The reason why Deng Tuo was interested in Li Sancai, who had been dead for hundreds of years, was because he had been dismissed from office. When Li Sancai was the minister of the Ministry of Revenue, he wanted to squeeze into the "cabinet." Shao Fuzhong, the director of the Ministry of Works, and others impeached Li Sancai for "being a great traitor who looks like a loyalist, and a great fraud who looks like a honest man, listing the four major crimes of greed, hypocrisy, danger, and tyranny." Li Sancai was forced to "resign." When he was living at home, censor Liu Guangfu accused him of "stealing imperial wood to privately build a camp," which caused another dispute. As a result, Li Sancai was "dismissed (that is, dismissed from office) as a commoner." The *History of the Ming Dynasty*'s comment on Li Sancai is: "Talented but fond of using tricks, good at co-opting court officials... by nature unable to maintain integrity, therefore destroyed by the public," "The world considers Sancai to be virtuous."

    The author of the *History of the Ming Dynasty* completely wrote in a tone of defending Li Sancai. Therefore, according to the history books, Li Sancai has no injustice and does not need to be defended. However, Deng Tuo was indignant for Li Sancai and wanted to reverse the verdict for him. He said, "Li Sancai repeatedly submitted memorials... It seems that he is justified, but the Wanli court dared not thoroughly investigate this fact. What is the truth of the matter? Isn't it very clear?"

    The matter of Li Sancai "stealing imperial wood" was investigated and found to be true according to the *History of the Ming Dynasty*, and Li Sancai was "dismissed as a commoner." What is strange is that Deng Tuo was so angry when writing this article. He ignored the records in the *History of the Ming Dynasty*, added embellishments, deliberately made waves, and insisted that Li Sancai "is justified," while the court "dared not thoroughly investigate."

    The truth of the matter is indeed very clear: the "Li Sancai" in Deng Tuo's pen is "Hai Zhongjie," that is, "Hai Rui," who are the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office by us. The reason why Deng Tuo described a butcher who suppressed peasant uprisings as a good official who spoke for the people and benefited the people, and defended his dismissal from office, was to cry out for injustice for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office. What Deng Tuo said was "justified" is the so-called anti-Party backbone. However, right-leaning opportunists are guilty in front of the people and in front of the Party. They are by no means "justified." They have long been "setting in the west, and their breath is dying."

    Deng Tuo also wrote an article *Zheng Banqiao and "Banqiao Style"*. The poem at the beginning of the article was written in 1961, of which four lines are: "A paintbrush is a historical pen; ten folk songs express the emotions of heaven and earth. Taking off the black gauze hat reveals the true face; splashing the ink dry is a lifetime." What is the whole article about? It is about Zheng Banqiao "losing his black gauze hat." He repeated again and again "dismissal from office": Zheng Banqiao "completely stood on the side of the people, seeking benefits for the disaster-stricken masses, and angered the feudal bureaucrats," therefore, "he was dismissed from office"; the ruling class "completely listened to the slanders of the local gentry and landlords," which finally made "Zheng Banqiao dismissed from office"; "after being dismissed from office," his thinking style became "more and more distinct."

    Deng Tuo also quoted a poem by Zheng Banqiao inscribed on his painting *Deep Mountain Orchid and Bamboo*: "Orchids are seen on the cliffs of deep mountains, and a few pieces of cold bamboo shadows are Xiao Xiao. It is necessary to take off the black gauze hat early, so that you can lie on a high pillow in the middle," and said, this painting was painted when he did not want to be an official. "If you compare the artistic conception in this painting with the official life experienced by the painter at that time, isn't its theme thought obvious?" That is to say, the theme thought of *Deep Mountain Orchid and Bamboo* is "It is necessary to take off the black gauze hat early," which is "dismissal from office."

    There is no doubt that the central idea of this article is to promote Zheng Banqiao's "proud bones" that he still did not succumb to "after being dismissed from office."

    In 1961, Deng Tuo also complained about the dismissal of Mi Wanzhong and Li Shan. He said that Mi Wanzhong was "a man of great integrity," "honest in politics, caring about people's criminal punishment," and repeatedly commented on current affairs, which was highly praised by the middle and lower classes of the people, so he was "dismissed from office." Said that Li Shan "was jealous of by a group of powerful figures, resulting in dismissal"; "the poem "two times in the scientific examination and one time in demotion" reflects Li Shan's "resentful and unfair mood."

    Obviously, Deng Tuo is using the spirits of these landlord classes to express his infinite sympathy for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office, and the words reveal his deep-seated hatred for the Party. In 1963, when our Party launched a counterattack against the ghosts and monsters who were launching a rampant offensive against the Party and socialism, Deng Tuo further called out through Zheng Banqiao's mouth: "Could it be that Heaven still holds back hate in its mouth, and does not allow a long sigh or two." This shows how deep his hatred is.

    After being dismissed from office in 1959, Deng Tuo wrote such a poem:

    Writing vigorously for twenty years, clearly neither dream nor smoke.
    Articles full of paper are the burden of scholars, comrades in arms who share the same boat in wind and rain are virtuous.
    Counting fingers should know the merits and demerits, caring most about the latter competing for the first.
    All my life I have won heroism, and the high tide of the whole country looks up to the sky.

    From this poem, it can be clearly seen that he himself was dismissed from office and harbored strong hatred for the Party. In this poem, Deng Tuo stubbornly expressed himself, defended himself, slandered the Party for not distinguishing his "merits" and "demerits"; Deng Tuo's "heroism" is the anti-Party "proud bones," the so-called "competing for the first," is waiting for the opportunity, attempting to make a comeback.

    From 1961 to 1963, the reason why Deng Tuo vigorously praised the "backbone" of those who were dismissed from office but did not succumb, on the one hand, was to echo Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* and closely cooperate to sing praises to the right-leaning opportunists; on the other hand, to vent his hatred for the Party and reverse the verdict for himself, attacking the Party.
	      Not allowed to slip away!

    Deng Tuo confessed that he understands "deceiving the heavens and crossing the sea," "borrowing a corpse to revive the soul," "muddling the waters to fish," "pointing at the mulberry and scolding the locust," "feigning foolishness," "hiding a knife in a smile," "creating something out of nothing," "ambushing on ten sides," and "bluffing" and other "conspiracies." He knew that going into battle naked was very "dangerous," so he always "went into battle fully armed." When he thought the time was favorable, he would attack fiercely. When he thought the time was unfavorable, he would prepare to slip away. Deng Tuo and his "brothers" in "Three-Family Village" are indeed a group of political conspirators.

    Deng Tuo and his gang grasped class struggle very tightly. They engaged in vicious struggle with the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.

    In June 1959, before the Lushan Conference, Wu Han, the vanguard of anti-Party and anti-socialist forces, released the big poisonous weed *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*, viciously cursing the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. After the Lushan Conference, another big poisonous weed *On Hai Rui* was released immediately. In order to cooperate with the right-leaning opportunist reversal offensive, in early 1961, Wu Han "broke out" and shot a big poisonous arrow *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* at the Party and socialism. In March 1961, Deng Tuo, the main general of the "Three-Family Village," "mounted the horse," and *Yanshan Night Talks* was staged. A few months later, Meng Chao's *Li Huiniang* and Tian Han's *Xie Yaohuan* were released at the same time. On October 12, 1961, Deng Tuo said the following black words in his essay *The Season for Planting Late Cabbage*: "I hope to be able to unite several gardening enthusiasts to do a small experiment with me: now sow the seeds of Chinese cabbage on the edge of the ground in front of my door, and strive to grow another crop of Chinese cabbage before the frost. Although this batch of Chinese cabbage cannot grow very large, it is also possible to have considerable harvest. Gaining some experience in this way will be more useful." As soon as the main general gave the order, in the same year and the same month, the "Three-Family Village" black inn opened in *Frontline*. In May 1962, after gaining "experience," they united another group of "gardening enthusiasts" and sowed another batch of "late cabbage"—"Changduanlu."

    For a time, a dark cloud appeared in the sky. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, Meng Chao, Xia Yan and others colluded with each other, formed a gang, opened special columns in *Frontline*, *Beijing Daily*, *Beijing Evening News* and the supplements of the *People's Daily*, addressed each other as brothers, talked long and short, and spread a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds. Ghosts and monsters came out one after another. They were blinded by greed, thought that the time had come, and arrogantly proposed that our Party must quickly "take complete rest" and use sticks to beat the revolutionaries to death.

    However, they completely misjudged the situation.

    In September 1962, our Party held the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. At the meeting, Chairman Mao further elaborated on his theory of classes and class struggle in socialist society, which he had put forward long ago, and taught us to carry out the class struggle of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's teachings, like a spring thunder, immediately brightened people's eyes. In this situation, Deng Tuo felt that the situation was not good, so he came up with a delaying tactic. He published an advertisement called *A Message to Readers*, saying that "due to recently turning the attention of amateur activities to other aspects, I no longer write *Yanshan Night Talks*." "It is not too late to write again when there is something to be learned in the future that must be written." It is clear that it was because the situation was unfavorable to them after the Tenth Plenary Session that the "Night Talks" were "dismounted," but he said that "attention was turned to other aspects." This is completely a set of deceptive lies. But on the other hand, he also hinted that once the opportunity came, when it was "impossible not to write," he would write again. The "Night Talks" were temporarily "dismounted," and the "Three-Family Village" black inn continued to "operate," observing the situation and waiting for the opportunity to move.

    In November 1965, Comrade Yao Wenyuan exposed that Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* was a big poisonous weed. Deng Tuo then hurriedly came on stage and wrote an article *From 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' to 'Moral Inheritance Theory'*, ostensibly criticizing Wu Han, but actually defending Wu Han. They tried to muddle through.

    How did Deng Tuo's article defend Wu Han?

    First, Deng Tuo said that the guiding ideology of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is the "theory of moral inheritance." He pretended and said, "Repeatedly exploring Comrade Wu Han's guiding ideology in researching Hai Rui and creating the script of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*," the conclusion is: the theory of moral inheritance. He determined that whether it is *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*, *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, or *On Hai Rui*, its ideological foundation is the theory of moral inheritance.

    Second, avoid the key issues. The key to *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is "dismissal from office," which is to sing praises to the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office. But Deng Tuo kept silent about "dismissal from office," and even indirectly explained to readers that the theme of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is not "dismissal from office."

    In short, Deng Tuo's article is ostensibly a criticism, but actually to blur the public's vision and shift the public's struggle goal; and to throw a lifebuoy to Wu Han, telling Wu Han that your problem is mainly in the moral inheritance issue, for the morality of the exploiting class, "absolutely cannot be inherited, and must adopt a revolutionary attitude," make a big fuss here, and we can avoid the "key" and slip away.

    Wu Han quickly said in his *Self-criticism on 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'*: "The criticism of Comrade Xiang Yangsheng" recently "made me realize my mistakes and correct my views." Then, in his self-criticism on moral discussion, he

    揭破邓拓反党反社会主义的面目
    林杰
    毛主席说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”
    一九五九年到一九六二年间，由于我国遭受到暂时的经济困难，一时沉渣泛起，兴妖作怪，牛鬼蛇神，纷纷登场，向党向社会主义发动了猖狂的进攻。我们必须从阴暗的角落里把他们全部暴露出来，让他们在光天化日之下示示众。
    阶级斗争，必然要反映到党内来，党内的资产阶级代理人，必然要从无产阶级政党内部来进行反党、反社会主义的活动。在向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的人物中，邓拓就是其中一个。
    邓拓是反党反社会主义“三家村”黑店的掌柜。几年来，邓拓、廖沫沙、吴晗等人，有领导、有组织、有计划地向以毛主席为首的党中央、向社会主义发动了一场大进攻。
    四月十六日《北京日报》发表一批所谓批判“三家村”和《燕山夜话》的材料，并且加了《前线》和《北京日报》两个编辑部的按语。无论是按语，无论是所编的关于《燕山夜话》的材料，都是竭力掩盖邓拓的反党反社会主义这个根本问题。这是借批判之名，行掩护之实，打着斗争的幌子，干着包庇的勾当。
    究竟邓拓等人是不是有领导、有组织、有计划地反党反社会主义，这是大是大非问题，是含糊不得的。在这个根本问题上含糊，就是包庇坏人。邓拓等人的反党反社会主义的面目，必须彻底揭露，坚决批判。
      小丑跳梁，恶毒地攻击我们
  伟大的党中央
    领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。我国革命和建设事业的伟大胜利，都是由于以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导。因此，国内外一切阶级敌人对我们的攻击，总是首先指向伟大的中国共产党。
    一九六二年二月二十二日，邓拓发表了《智谋是可靠的吗？》。这篇杂文的矛头是指向谁的呢？
    邓拓大肆议论所谓当皇帝的要倾听人民群众的意见。他说，匡衡曾经向汉元帝进谏说，作皇帝的要“广谋从众”；著名学者郑兴，也曾经劝告汉光武帝，要“博采广谋，纳群下之策”。在列举了古代的帝王将相如何虚心地接受“群下”的意见之后，邓拓即借古讽今地评论说：“这些古人的见解都很不错。特别是范尧夫所说的‘不必谋自己出’，这一点尤其值得注意。有的人常常喜欢自己逞能，自作聪明，看不起群众，不管什么事情总是要自己出主意，企图出奇制胜，而不接受下面群众的好意见。”
    首先，认为封建的帝王将相能够接受群众的意见，这是完全歪曲历史事实的。匡衡、郑兴所说的帝王听取“众”、“群”的意见，就是要听宰相、尚书等官僚的意见。说什么地主阶级的帝王将相，能听取群众的意见，这是别有用心的。
    第二，邓拓不厌其烦地宣扬什么匡衡、郑兴要汉元帝、光武帝“纳群下之策”，究竟是什么意思呢？在这里，所谓“群下”指的是谁？汉元帝、光武帝指的又是谁？人们自然会想起吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》中所说的：“你自以为是，拒绝批评，你的错误太多了”。邓拓说的“喜欢自己逞能，自作聪明，看不起群众”，这是对吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》的进一步发挥。邓拓所说的“群众”，就是邓拓之流反党反社会主义的阴谋家，而他所说的汉元帝、光武帝就是以毛主席为首的党中央。
    第三，邓拓攻击我们党“企图出奇制胜”。革命，就是要出奇制胜。革命的时代，就是无产阶级政党领导千百万群众创造奇迹的时代。右派分子曾经攻击我们党中央“好大喜功”，反右斗争前夕，一九五七年五月，邓拓自己也攻击我们党中央“贪大喜功”，现在，邓拓又攻击我们党中央“企图出奇制胜”。可见他对社会主义革命事业的胜利是多么的仇恨。无产阶级和劳动群众歌颂党，歌颂党的伟大领袖，就是歌颂无产阶级革命事业的伟大胜利。而鄙视劳动群众的邓拓、吴晗等人却相反，他们竭力歌颂帝王将相，歌颂剥削阶级的头子，恶毒地谩骂无产阶级的党。
    在《“伟大的空话”》这篇杂文中，邓拓更露骨地攻击伟大的毛泽东思想。邓拓说：“东风是我们的恩人，西风是我们的敌人”，这是“伟大的空话”，是“无济于事”的“陈词滥调”，“越说得多，反而越糟糕”。
      “东风压倒西风”是毛主席关于国际形势的著名论断。毛泽东同志在一九五七年各国共产党和工人党会议上说：“我认为目前形势的特点是东风压倒西风，也就是说，社会主义的力量对于帝国主义的力量占了压倒的优势。”“东风压倒西风”，是运用马克思列宁主义分析现阶段国际阶级力量的对比，所作出的科学论断。这个科学论断是各国革命人民的精神原子弹。它越来越被广大革命人民所掌握，极大地鼓舞了并且继续鼓舞着全世界被压迫被剥削人民的革命斗争。这个科学论断，击中了帝国主义、各国反动派和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的要害，使他们胆战心惊，怕得发抖。对于帝国主义、各国反动派和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者来说，确实是，我们宣传得越多，他们就越糟糕。如果真是一句“无济于事”的空话，那么，邓拓之流的修正主义分子，为什么这样拚死命地来反对呢？
    上面这些咒骂，邓拓认为还不足以发泄他内心敌视我党的资产阶级仇恨。一九六二年七月二十五日，他在《前线》发表了一篇叫做《专治“健忘症”》的杂文。在这篇文章里，他用了最恶毒的语言来攻击以毛主席为首的党中央，辱骂我们党“自食其言”，“言而无信”，“装疯卖傻，不堪信任”。这篇文章，一派黑话。既然是“黑话”，当然是见不得太阳的，因此，邓拓扬言这是一篇谈医说病的文章。这是弥天大谎！让我们剥开皮来看看吧。
    文章引了《艾子后语》中一则故事，据说，齐国有一个人得了健忘病，去请“滑稽多智”的艾子治病，刚出家门几十步，自己的屋子、自己的老婆就认不得了，甚至连自己刚拉的屎，都不认得。邓拓说，这是“健忘症的一个典型病例”。真是欺人太甚！《艾子后语》明明是一部政治讽刺小品，哪里是什么谈医说病的？这本书是“意有所寓”，是“以讥时相”，“规切时政”的。邓拓当然知道《艾子后语》是“以讥时相”、“规切时政”的文章，但是他却指鹿为马，说这是“健忘症的一个典型病例”！
    《前线》杂志是中共北京市委的理论刊物，为什么忽然发表专门谈治健忘症的文章？身为北京市委书记、管理论宣传工作的邓拓，为什么“破门而出”，行起“医”来呢？既然是行医治病，为什么伤风感冒、痢疾、伤寒等病都不治，而偏偏“专治”健忘症？是不是因为“健忘症”在当时已经成了严重地影响人民健康的流行病，以致需要《前线》发表专文，需要邓拓亲临“前线”专治？
      “自食其言”，“言而无信”，这是政治概念，而不是医学概念。至于“装疯卖傻，不堪信任”，这同“健忘症”更是风马牛不相及。很显然，邓拓是在这里讲政治，而不是讲医学。
    邓拓还编造了“专治健忘症”的所谓“积极的”方法：一是用狗血淋头；一是用棍子打击病人头部，使之休克，然后再把他“救醒”。遍查医书，找不到用狗血淋头或打棍子这种专治“健忘症”的秘方。狗血淋头、打棍子，这明明是政治手法，那里是什么治病的药方？
    邓拓竟要对我们党狗血淋头、打棍子，这是多么的恶毒！
    只是狗血淋头、打棍子还不够，邓拓这位“专治健忘症”的专家，还命令“病人”：“必须赶紧完全休息，什么话都不要说，什么事情都不能做”，一切听从他这位“高明的医师指导”，“健忘病者本人切不要乱加干涉”。邓拓所攻击的“健忘病者”就是我们伟大的党。他要我们党什么话都不要说，什么事都不要做，“完全休息”，这就是要我们党下台。
    在当时，叫嚣要我们党下台的都是些什么人呢？
    一九六二年，蒋介石在美帝国主义的指使下，叫嚷要反攻大陆，国内的阶级敌人，地富反坏右进行反革命的复辟活动，同时又刮起了一股单干风、翻案风。就在国内外阶级敌人反对我们党，反对社会主义这股逆流闹得最凶的时刻，北京市委机关刊物《前线》，发表了邓拓这篇最恶毒的文章，叫喊要我们党下台。
    你看，钻在党内的邓拓，同国内外的阶级敌人配合得多么密切！
    邓拓还恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政。他借古讽今地说，“王道”就是“按照当时通行的人情和社会道德标准”办事，“霸道”就是“依靠权势，蛮横逞强”，说什么“即便在古代，王道也毕竟要比霸道好得多”，要我们从这里“找出经验教训”，并且骂我们“到处树敌，多么不得人心”。很显然，这是攻击无产阶级专政。我们说，在存在阶级和阶级斗争的社会里，剥削阶级所说的“王道”、“霸道”，都是剥削阶级对人民的专政。“王道”和“霸道”是他们统治人民的两手。他们所宣扬的什么“王道”，只是对被剥削阶级的一种欺骗。我们无产阶级和劳动人民推翻剥削阶级之后，正是以其人之道，还治其人之身，就是要“依靠权势”，即依靠国家机器和广大工农群众对地富反坏右实行专政。在这个情况下，邓拓气势汹汹地反对“霸道”，声嘶力竭地宣扬“王道”，这就是反对无产阶级专政，这就是妄图复辟资产阶级专政。
    把邓拓的上述言论，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反动言论加以对照，他的反党面目就更加暴露无遗了。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者煽动地说：“必须更勇敢和坚决揭露关于荒唐无稽的‘西风和东风’的竞争的教条主义理论”；邓拓则说什么“东风”、“西风”都是“陈词滥调”。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者污蔑我们“白天黑夜地叫喊世界革命，叫喊打倒美帝国主义”，是“用空洞的咒文、响亮的辞句和挥舞马粪纸做的剑”；邓拓则说，“东风”是“恩人”、“西风”是“敌人”的口号，是“无济于事”的空话。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者用反对“个人迷信”这个口号，来反对全世界的马克思列宁主义政党和马克思列宁主义者，对无产阶级的国家进行颠覆活动。敌视群众，更不懂得什么是“群众的智慧”的邓拓，竟然狂妄地说我们党“凭着自己的明智”，“不重视群众的智慧”。这不过是重复赫鲁晓夫修正主义者诬蔑我们的滥调，配合赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对我们的颠覆活动。
    国内外敌人对我们进行颠覆活动，采取和平演变的手段，企图实行反革命复辟；而邓拓则要以资产阶级专政代替无产阶级专政，要我们党“完全休息”，一切由他们这些修正主义分子取而代之。
    邓拓是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的应声虫。邓拓所讲的，就是赫鲁晓夫所讲的。邓拓想要做的，就是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在苏联所做的复辟资本主义的活动。
      蚍蜉撼大树，反对党的总路
  线，攻击大跃进
    对党的社会主义建设总路线和大跃进，邓拓用所谓讲故事的手法，在《爱护劳动力的学说》、《黄金和宝剑的骗局》、《说大话的故事》、《今年的春节》、《白开水最好喝》等等杂文中，射出一支又一支的毒箭。
    一九六一年，邓拓在《北京晚报》上讲了两则外国寓言故事。一个是竞技人好说大话，一个是山雀夸口，要把海水烧干。
    与《两则外国寓言》同时，邓拓对我们的社会主义革命事业，射来另一支毒箭：《一个鸡蛋的家当》。
    这篇杂文的材料是从明人江盈科的《雪涛小说》上抄来的。故事是讲，有一个人全部的家当只有一个拾来的鸡蛋，这个人幻想鸡蛋生鸡，鸡生蛋，卖鸡买牛，牛再生牛，翻几番，最后还打算讨小老婆。结果引起他老婆的“怫然大怒”，“一拳头就把他的家当打得精光”。
    邓拓讲了这个故事之后，问道：“你看这个故事不是可以说明许多问题吗？”究竟说明什么问题呢？邓拓接着说：这个人虽然懂得“要有十年才能挣到这份家当”，“但是，他的计划简直没有任何可靠的根据”，“用空想代替了现实”，“想入非非”，以致“这一个鸡蛋的家当就全部毁掉了”。
    在这些所谓的“故事”中，邓拓讲了三个意思：（一）竞技人、山雀、只有一个鸡蛋的人，他们的“伟大计划”都是“胡吹牛皮”；（二）他们夸大了“心理要素”的作用，自以为凭着“心理要素”就可以“为所欲为”，结果“在实际的事物面前碰得头破血流”，宣告“破产”，“完蛋”了；（三）牛皮吹破以后，“受骗的人们”不要“轻易地放走吹牛的骗子”。
    在这里，邓拓真的是讲故事吗？不是。
    从来寓言故事，都是意有所寓的。江盈科讲的那个故事的题目就叫做《妄心》，是讽刺那些“世之妄意早计，希图非望者”，即讽刺那些希望早一点、快一点实现自己目的的人。邓拓也在文章中反复启发读者，要懂得这些故事的现实意义。他说：“如果你有举一反三的理解力”，那末，“这些寓言，显然都包含了深远的意义”，可以说明现在的“许多问题”；“事实显然证明”，“直到如今，这样吹牛的人物，随时随地都还可以遇见”。他并且指着鼻子说：“请问，你听见山雀的夸口没有？你看见带着汤匙去赴宴的没有？”你看，邓拓就是用这种挑战的口吻宣告，他讲的故事是有目的的，他的目的就是攻击党的总路线，攻击大跃进。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，全国人民要求迅速改变我国一穷二白的落后面貌，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。帝国主义者曾经嘲笑我们，说我们是“说大话”，是“吹牛皮”。在我国遭受暂时经济困难时，帝国主义者就叫嚷中国的大跃进“失败了”，攻击我们的社会主义建设“完蛋了”。而邓拓所讲的这些故事，就是攻击我们的总路线、大跃进是“说大话”，是“胡吹牛皮”，是“想入非非”，是“用空想代替了现实”，结果“碰得头破血流”，把全部穷家当都“毁掉”了。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者攻击我们的总路线、大跃进“是一条危险的尝试的道路”，是“经济中的主观主义和唯意志论”，遭到了“彻底失败”。邓拓对我们的攻击同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的攻击，如出一辙。
    对于国内外阶级敌人的无耻污蔑，我们党早就有力地作了驳斥。我们党说：我们用大跃进的速度把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国，难道这是做不到的吗？是吹牛皮、放大炮吗？不，是做得到的。既不是吹牛皮，也不是放大炮。只要看我们的历史就可以知道了。我们不是在我们的国家里把貌似强大的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义从基本上打倒了吗？我们不是从一个一穷二白的基地上经过十几年的努力，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各方面，也达到了可观的水平吗？我们不是也爆炸了原子弹吗？中国出现大跃进，这是一种必然趋势，是任何反动势力所阻挡不了的。
    在事实面前“碰得头破血流”的，不是我们，而是国内外的阶级敌人，是一小撮右倾机会主义者即修正主义者。
    应该指出，邓拓对党的总路线、大跃进不只是骂骂而已，他气势汹汹地煽动说：“牛皮既已吹破，受骗的人们就决不会轻易地放走吹牛的骗子”，这就是说，他要纠集牛鬼蛇神起来推翻我们的党，推翻无产阶级专政。我们也还是要以其人之道还治其人之身。按照邓拓自己的说法，他这个政治骗子的面目既已被大家揭破，我们也绝不能轻易放他过去！
      替被罢了官的右倾机会主义
  者辩护，为他们唱赞歌
    邓拓上述攻击党、攻击总路线的言论，完全是右倾机会主义即修正主义的言论。现在已经查明，一九五七年，反右斗争之前，邓拓发表了许多反党反社会主义的资产阶级右派言论，邓拓是漏网的右派。一九五九年，他被罢了官，被撤销了他在人民日报担任的重要工作。邓拓替被罢了官的右倾机会主义者呼冤喊屈，同时也就是为他自己呼冤喊屈。
    吴晗的《海瑞罢官》出笼以后，邓拓忽然发思古之幽情，写了一篇《为李三才辩护》的文章。
    邓拓说，李三才“是一个正面的历史人物”，李三才“攻击封建黑暗政治”的英雄事迹“被湮没”，这是使人“感到遗憾的事情”。对于李三才的所谓不白之冤，邓拓不仅为之万分痛惜，而且讲起来情绪很激动。李三才究竟是何许人，邓拓为什么要替他辩护？
    李三才是明代万历时的一个官僚，任过凤阳巡抚、户部尚书等职。他是双手沾满农民起义者鲜血的刽子手，是地主阶级的忠实奴才，是人民的死敌，根本不是“正面人物”。
    邓拓所以对已死几百年的李三才感兴趣，因为他被罢过官。李三才任户部尚书时，想挤入“内阁”，工部郎中邵辅忠等奏劾李三才“大奸似忠，大诈似直，列具贪、伪、险、横四大罪”。李三才被迫“罢官”。居家时，御史刘光复告他“盗皇木私建营第”，又引起一场争论。结果李三才“落职（即罢官）为民”。《明史》对李三才的评论是：“才大而好用机权，善笼络朝士……性不能持廉，以故为众所毁”，“世以三才为贤”。
    《明史》作者完全是用替李三才辩护的口气来写的。因此，从史书上说，李三才没有不白之冤，用不着辩护。可是，邓拓却为李三才愤愤不平，要替他翻案。他说，“李三才又一再上疏，……看来他是理直气壮的，而万历的朝廷却不敢彻底查究这个事实。问题的真相如何，这不是很明白了吗？”
    李三才“盗皇木”的事，据《明史》记载是经过查究属实，并且把李三才“落职为民”。奇怪的是，邓拓在写这篇文章时，火气却那么大，他不顾《明史》记载，添枝画叶，故作波澜，硬说李三才“是理直气壮的”，而朝廷方面“却不敢彻底查究”。
    问题的真相如何，确实很明白：邓拓笔下的这位“李三才”，就是“海忠介”即“海瑞”，就是被我们罢了官的右倾机会主义分子。邓拓所以把一个镇压农民起义的刽子手说成是为民请命、为民兴利的好官；为他的被罢官辩护，就是为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子喊冤。邓拓所说的“理直气壮”，就是所谓反党骨气。但是，右倾机会主义者在人民面前，在党面前，是有罪的，他们决不是“理直气壮”的。他们早已“日薄西山，气息奄奄”了。
    邓拓还写了《郑板桥和“板桥体”》一文。文章开头的一首诗是一九六一年写的，其中四句是：“一支画笔春秋笔；十首道情天地情。脱却乌纱真面目；泼干水墨是生平。”全文讲的是什么呢？讲的是郑板桥“丢乌纱帽”。他翻来复去说“罢官”：郑板桥“完全站在人民的方面，为受灾群众谋利益，而激怒了封建官僚”，因此，“罢官而去”；统治阶级“完全听信了豪绅地主们的诬告”，终于使“郑板桥竟罢官而去”；“罢官以后”，他的思想作风“越来越鲜明”。
    邓拓还引了郑板桥题在自己画的《深山兰竹图》上的一首诗：“深山绝壁见幽兰，竹影萧萧几片寒。一顶乌纱须早脱，好来高枕卧其间”，并说，这幅画是在他不愿做官的时候画的，如果“把这个画中的境界和当时画家所经历的官宦生活做一对照，它的主题思想不是显而易见了吗？”这就是说，《深山兰竹图》的主题思想就是“一顶乌纱须早脱”，就是“罢官”。
    毫无疑问，这篇文章的中心思想，就是宣传郑板桥在“罢官以后”仍旧不屈服的“傲骨”。
    一九六一年，邓拓还为米万钟、李鱓的被罢官鸣不平。他说，米万钟是“很有骨气的人”，“为政清廉，关心民刑”，屡评时政，颇受中下层人民称颂，因此遭到“罢官”。说李鱓“被一班权贵人物所忌，以致解职”；“两革科名一贬官”这句诗反映李鱓“愤懑不平的心情”。
    显然，邓拓是借这些地主阶级的亡灵，抒发自己对被罢了官的右倾机会主义者的无限同情，字里行间流露出他对党的刻骨仇恨。一九六三年，当我们党对那些向党、向社会主义进行猖狂进攻的牛鬼蛇神展开反击时，邓拓更借郑板桥的口叫出：“难道天公还拑恨口，不许长吁一两声”。足见仇恨之深。
    邓拓在一九五九年被罢官之后，写了这样的一首诗：
    笔走龙蛇二十年，分明非梦亦非烟。
    文章满纸书生累，风雨同舟战友贤。
    屈指当知功与过，关心最是后争先。
    平生赢得豪情在，举国高潮望接天。
    从这首诗中，可以明白地看出，他自己被罢官，对党是怀着强烈的仇恨的。在这首诗里，邓拓顽强地表现自己，为自己辩解，污蔑党没有分清他的“功”、“过”；邓拓的“豪情”，就是反党的“傲骨”，所谓“后争先”，就是等待时机，企图东山再起。
    一九六一年到一九六三年间，邓拓所以大肆颂扬被罢了官而不屈服的“骨气”，一方面是为了同吴晗的《海瑞罢官》互相呼应，密切配合，替右倾机会主义者唱赞歌；另一方面，发泄他自己胸中对党的仇恨，为自己闹翻案，向党进攻。	      不准滑过去！
    邓拓供认，他懂得“瞒天过海”、“借尸还魂”、“浑水摸鱼”、“指桑骂槐”、“假痴不癫”、“笑里藏刀”、“无中生有”、“十面埋伏”、“虚张声势”等等“阴谋诡计”。他知道赤膊上阵是很“危险”的，因此，他总是“披挂上阵”。在他认为时机有利时，就狠狠进攻，在他认为时机不利时，就准备滑过去。邓拓和他们“三家村”的“兄弟们”，确是一伙政治阴谋家。
    邓拓这一伙对阶级斗争抓得很紧，他们同以毛主席为首的党中央，恶毒地进行了斗争。
    一九五九年六月，庐山会议前，反党反社会主义的急先锋吴晗，放出了大毒草《海瑞骂皇帝》，恶毒地咒骂以毛主席为首的党中央。庐山会议之后，紧接着又放出了另一株大毒草《论海瑞》。为了配合右倾机会主义的翻案进攻，一九六一年初，吴晗“破门而出”，向党向社会主义射出了一支大毒箭《海瑞罢官》。一九六一年三月，“三家村”的主将邓拓“上马”，《燕山夜话》上台演出了。过了几个月，孟超的《李慧娘》、田汉的《谢瑶环》同时出笼。一九六一年十月十二日，邓拓在《种晚菘的季节》杂文中，讲了如下一段黑话：“我希望能够联合几位园艺的爱好者，同我一起来做个小小的试验：在自己门前的地边，现在再撒下大白菜的种子，争取在下霜以前再长出一茬白菜。虽然这一批白菜不能长得很大，但是，也很可能还有相当的收获。这样取得一些经验，将会有更多的用处”。主将一声令下，就在同年同月，“三家村”黑店在“前线”开张了。一九六二年五月，他们取得了“经验”之后，又联合了一批“园艺爱好者”，撒下了另一批“晚菘”——“长短录”。
    一时天空出现了一片乌云，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙、孟超、夏衍等人，串通一气，结为一伙，在《前线》、《北京日报》、《北京晚报》和《人民日报》的副刊上，开辟专栏，称兄道弟，说长论短，散播了大量的反党反社会主义的毒草。牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。他们利令智昏，以为时机已到，狂妄地提出，要我们党必须赶紧“完全休息”，要用棍子把革命者打死。
    但是，他们对形势完全作了错误的估计。
    一九六二年九月，我们党举行八届十中全会，会上毛主席进一步阐明了他早就提出的关于社会主义社会的阶级、阶级斗争的理论，并且教导我们开展兴无灭资的阶级斗争。毛主席的教导，象一声春雷，使人们的眼睛立刻明亮起来了。在这种情况下，邓拓觉得形势不妙，于是来了一个缓兵之计。他登了一则广告，叫《奉告读者》，说是“由于近来把业余活动的注意力转到其他方面，我已经不写《燕山夜话》了。”“等将来确有一点心得，非写不可的时候，再写不迟”。明明是因为十中全会之后形势对他们不利，“夜话”才“下马”的，却说什么“注意力转到其他方面”。这完全是一套骗人的鬼话。但是，另一方面他又暗示，一旦时机到来，“非写不可时”，还要再写。“夜话”暂时“下马”，“三家村”黑店照常“营业”，观察形势，伺机而动。
    一九六五年十一月，姚文元同志揭露了吴晗的《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草。邓拓便匆忙出场，写了一篇《从〈海瑞罢官〉谈到“道德继承论”》，表面上是批评吴晗，实际上是替吴晗辩护。他们企图混过关去。
    邓拓的这篇文章，是怎样为吴晗辩护的呢？
    第一，邓拓说，《海瑞罢官》的指导思想是“道德继承论”。他装腔作势地说，“反复探索吴晗同志研究海瑞和创作《海瑞罢官》这个剧本的指导思想”，结论是：道德继承论。他断定，无论是《海瑞骂皇帝》《海瑞罢官》还是《论海瑞》，它的思想基础都是道德继承论。
    第二，回避要害问题。《海瑞罢官》的要害就是“罢官”，就是替被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子唱赞歌。但是邓拓却闭口不提“罢官”，而且转弯抹角地向读者说明，《海瑞罢官》的主题不是“罢官”。
    总之，邓拓的文章表面上是批判，实际上是为了模糊群众的视线，转移群众的斗争目标；并且丢给吴晗一个救生圈，告诉吴晗，你的问题主要在道德继承问题上，对于剥削阶级道德，“决不能加以继承，而且必须采取革命的态度”，在这里大作文章，我们就可以避开“要害”，滑过去了。
    吴晗在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中连忙说：“最近向阳生同志”的批评，“使我认识了错误，改正了自己的观点”。接着，在他写的关于道德讨论的自我批评中，干脆就用邓拓抛给他的救生圈做题目，叫做《是革命，还是继承？》他完全按照邓拓的调子唱歌，承认自己确实是一个“旧道德继承论者”。他说：“不管那一篇文章或讲话的中心论点，归根到底只是一个”，这就是“道德继承论”。并说邓拓的批评是“科学的批评”，“我诚恳地接受，并且表示深切的感谢。”
    这是“贼喊捉贼”的一出双簧戏。
    他们认为一方提出了“批评”，一方“承认”了错误，进行了“检讨”，事情就可以过去了，邓拓、吴晗等一伙反党反社会主义分子，就可以溜之大吉了。
    但是，事情的发展，是邓拓等人料不到的。他们的这些活动反而进一步暴露了他们反党反社会主义的丑恶面目。
    毛主席教导我们：各种剥削阶级的代表人物，“他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”今天重读这段话，是多么的亲切呵！
    上述事实说明了什么呢？它说明：
    第一，邓拓等人反党反社会主义活动，贯穿着一条黑线，这条黑线是：诬蔑、攻击党和以敬爱的毛主席为首的党中央，恶毒地攻击党的总路线、大跃进，极力支持被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子的翻案进攻，积极进行资本主义的复辟活动。
    第二，他们的反党反社会主义是有领导有组织的。有将有帅，有掌柜，有伙计。他们彼此呼应，互相合作，结为一伙反党反社会主义的集团。
    第三，邓拓等人的反党反社会主义是有计划的。也就是说，何时进攻，怎样进攻，何时退却，如何退却，等等，他们是有一整套进退应变策略的。
    这说明，他们的反党反社会主义，是有领导、有组织、有计划的。我们同他们的斗争，是一场无产阶级和资产阶级之间异常尖锐的你死我活的阶级斗争，决不能等闲视之。但是，他们这一伙不过是一只纸老虎，看起来，他们神气活现，只要把他们放在太阳底下一照，他们就原形毕露了，他们就垮台了。
    既然邓拓反党反社会主义集团的阴谋已经暴露，画皮已经撕破，手法已经戳穿，我们就一定要穷追到底。
    彻底的唯物主义者，是无所畏惧的。在这场惊心动魄的阶级斗争中，我们一定要敢于揭露矛盾，敢于斗争，敢于夺取一个又一个的胜利。攻无不克、战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，引导着我们胜利前进。
