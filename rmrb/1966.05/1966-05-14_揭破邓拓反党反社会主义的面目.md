    Chairman Mao said: "All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, should be criticized and must not be allowed to spread freely."

    During the period from 1959 to 1962, due to the temporary economic difficulties our country encountered, dregs momentarily floated to the surface, evil things emerged to create trouble, and ghosts and monsters all appeared on the stage, launching a frenzied attack against the Party and socialism. We must expose them all from the dark corners and let them be paraded in broad daylight.

    Class struggle is bound to be reflected within the Party, and the bourgeois agents within the Party are bound to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities from within the proletarian party. Deng Tuo was one of the figures who launched a frenzied attack against the Party and socialism.

    Deng Tuo is the owner of the anti-Party and anti-socialist "Three-Family Village" black inn. Over the past few years, Deng Tuo, Liao Mosha, Wu Han and others have launched a major offensive against the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and against socialism in a guided, organized, and planned manner.

    On April 16, the *Beijing Daily* published a batch of materials so-called criticizing "Three-Family Village" and *Yanshan Night Talks*, and added a note from the editorial departments of *Frontline* and *Beijing Daily*. Both the note and the compiled materials on *Yanshan Night Talks* tried their best to cover up the fundamental issue of Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist nature. This was using criticism as a cover, carrying out protection in the name of struggle, and engaging in shielding activities.

    Whether Deng Tuo and others were leading, organizing, and planning to oppose the Party and socialism is a major issue of right and wrong that cannot be blurred. Being vague on this fundamental issue is tantamount to shielding bad people. The anti-Party and anti-socialist face of Deng Tuo and others must be thoroughly exposed and resolutely criticized.

      The clowns leaped around, viciously attacking our
  Great Party Central Committee

    The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party. The great victories of our country's revolution and construction are all due to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by the respected Chairman Mao. Therefore, all class enemies at home and abroad always direct their attacks first at the great Chinese Communist Party.

    On February 22, 1962, Deng Tuo published "Is Wisdom Reliable?". Who is the target of this essay?

    Deng Tuo vigorously discussed the so-called emperors listening to the opinions of the people. He said that Kuang Heng had once advised Emperor Yuan of Han to "seek wide counsel from the masses"; the famous scholar Zheng Xing had also advised Emperor Guangwu of Han to "broadly seek counsel and accept the strategies of his subordinates." After listing how the ancient emperors and generals humbly accepted the opinions of their "subordinates," Deng Tuo commented sarcastically, "These ancient people's views were very good. In particular, Fan Yaofu's saying 'do not necessarily devise your own plans' is especially worthy of attention. Some people often like to show off their abilities, act clever, look down on the masses, and always want to come up with their own ideas, trying to win by surprise, instead of accepting the good opinions of the masses below."

    First of all, it is a complete distortion of historical facts to believe that feudal emperors and generals could accept the opinions of the masses. The "masses" and "subordinates" that Kuang Heng and Zheng Xing referred to when asking the Han emperors to listen to opinions, meant the opinions of bureaucrats such as prime ministers and ministers. To say that emperors and generals of the landlord class could listen to the opinions of the masses is something with ulterior motives.

    Second, Deng Tuo tirelessly preached about Kuang Heng and Zheng Xing wanting Emperor Yuan and Guangwu of Han to "adopt the strategies of their subordinates." What exactly does this mean? Who were the so-called "subordinates" here? Who did Emperor Yuan and Guangwu of Han refer to? People will naturally think of Wu Han's words in *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*: "You are self-righteous, refuse criticism, you have too many mistakes." Deng Tuo's saying "likes to show off his abilities, act clever, and look down on the masses" is a further elaboration of Wu Han's *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*. The "masses" that Deng Tuo refers to are the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspirators of Deng Tuo's ilk, while the Emperor Yuan and Guangwu of Han that he refers to are the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.

    Third, Deng Tuo attacked our Party for "attempting to win by surprise." Revolution is about winning by surprise. The era of revolution is the era of the proletarian party leading millions of people to create miracles. Rightists once attacked our Party Central Committee for "being fond of greatness and eager for success." Before the anti-Rightist struggle, in May 1957, Deng Tuo himself attacked our Party Central Committee for "being greedy for greatness and eager for success." It is evident how much he hates the victory of the socialist revolutionary cause. The proletariat and the working masses sing the praises of the Party and the great leader of the Party, precisely because they are singing the praises of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause. In contrast, Deng Tuo, Wu Han and others, who despise the working masses, try their best to praise emperors and generals, and the heads of the exploiting classes, viciously cursing the proletarian party.

    In the essay "The 'Great Empty Words'," Deng Tuo even more blatantly attacked the great Mao Zedong Thought. Deng Tuo said, "'The East Wind prevails over the West Wind' is our benefactor, and the West Wind is our enemy" is "great empty words," "useless" "clich√©s," and "the more you say it, the worse it gets."

      "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is Chairman Mao's famous thesis on the international situation. Comrade Mao Zedong said at the meeting of communist and workers' parties of various countries in 1957: "I believe that the characteristic of the current situation is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, that is to say, the socialist forces have an overwhelming advantage over the imperialist forces." "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is a scientific conclusion drawn by analyzing the comparison of international class forces at the current stage using Marxism-Leninism. This scientific conclusion is the spiritual atomic bomb of the revolutionary people of various countries. It is increasingly being grasped by the broad revolutionary people, greatly inspiring and continuing to inspire the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed and exploited people all over the world. This scientific conclusion hit the vital points of imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and Khrushchev revisionism, making them tremble with fear. For imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and Khrushchev revisionists, it is indeed true that the more we publicize it, the worse it gets for them. If it were really a "useless" empty word, then why would revisionists like Deng Tuo oppose it so desperately?

    Deng Tuo thought that these curses were not enough to vent the bourgeois hatred in his heart that was hostile to our Party. On July 25, 1962, he published an essay called "Specializing in 'Amnesia'" in *Frontline*. In this article, he used the most vicious language to attack the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, scolding our Party for "going back on its word," "not keeping its promises," and "feigning madness and foolishness, unworthy of trust." This article is full of black talk. Since it is "black talk," it is of course unable to see the sun, so Deng Tuo asserted that this was an article about talking about medical treatment. This is a monstrous lie! Let us peel off the skin and take a look.

    The article cited a story from *Aizi Houyu*, which said that there was a person in the State of Qi who suffered from amnesia and asked Aizi, who was "humorous and intelligent," to treat him. Just a few dozen steps out of his house, he could not recognize his own house or his own wife, and he could not even recognize the stool he had just left. Deng Tuo said that this was "a typical case of amnesia." This is really too deceitful! *Aizi Houyu* is clearly a political satire, how can it be talking about medical treatment? This book "has implied meanings," "satirizes the times," and "admonishes contemporary politics." Deng Tuo certainly knew that *Aizi Houyu* was an article that "satirizes the times" and "admonishes contemporary politics," but he called a stag a horse, saying that it was "a typical case of amnesia"!

    *Frontline* magazine is the theoretical publication of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Why did it suddenly publish an article specifically on treating amnesia? Deng Tuo, who was the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and in charge of theoretical propaganda, why did he "break out" and become a "doctor"? Since he was practicing medicine, why did he not treat diseases such as colds, dysentery, and typhoid fever, but "specialize" in amnesia? Is it because "amnesia" had become a serious epidemic affecting people's health at that time, so that *Frontline* needed to publish a special article, and Deng Tuo had to come to the "front line" to specialize in treatment?

      "Going back on its word," "not keeping its promises" are political concepts, not medical concepts. As for "feigning madness and foolishness, unworthy of trust," this is even more irrelevant to "amnesia." It is very clear that Deng Tuo is talking about politics here, not medicine.

    Deng Tuo also fabricated so-called "positive" methods for "specializing in amnesia": one is to drench the head with dog's blood; the other is to hit the patient's head with a stick to make him go into shock, and then "awaken" him. After searching through medical books, one cannot find such a secret recipe for specializing in "amnesia" using dog's blood or hitting with sticks. Drenching with dog's blood and hitting with sticks are clearly political tactics, where can they be a prescription for treating disease?

    Deng Tuo actually wanted to drench our Party with dog's blood and hit it with sticks, how vicious this is!

    Just drenching with dog's blood and hitting with sticks is not enough. Deng Tuo, this expert who "specializes in amnesia," also ordered the "patient": "must quickly take complete rest, say nothing, do nothing," and listen to his "high-level doctor's guidance," and "the person with amnesia must not interfere indiscriminately." The "person with amnesia" that Deng Tuo attacked is our great Party. He wants our Party to say nothing, do nothing, and "take complete rest," which is to say that he wants our Party to step down.

    At that time, who were the people who clamored for our Party to step down?

    In 1962, Chiang Kai-shek, under the direction of US imperialism, clamored to counterattack the mainland, and domestic class enemies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists carried out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. At the same time, a wind of individual farming and reversing verdicts was blowing. It was at the moment when this adverse current of domestic and foreign class enemies opposing our Party and socialism was making the most noise, that *Frontline*, the organ of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, published this most vicious article by Deng Tuo, clamoring for our Party to step down.

    Look, Deng Tuo, who was drilling within the Party, coordinated so closely with the class enemies at home and abroad!

    Deng Tuo also viciously attacked the proletarian dictatorship. He used the past to satirize the present, saying that "the way of kings" is to act "according to the prevailing human feelings and social moral standards," and "the way of hegemons" is to "rely on power and act brutally and arbitrarily," saying that "even in ancient times, the way of kings was better than the way of hegemons," and that we should "find lessons from this," and scolding us for "making enemies everywhere, how unpopular." It is very clear that this is an attack on the proletarian dictatorship. We say that in a society where classes and class struggle exist, the "way of kings" and "way of hegemons" spoken of by the exploiting classes are all the dictatorship of the exploiting classes over the people. "The way of kings" and "the way of hegemons" are the two hands with which they ruled the people. What they promoted as "the way of kings" was just a deception of the exploited classes. After we, the proletariat and the working people, overthrew the exploiting classes, we precisely used their own methods to treat them, that is, we wanted to "rely on power," that is, relying on the state machinery and the broad masses of workers and peasants to implement dictatorship over landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. In this situation, Deng Tuo opposed "the way of hegemons" with great fanfare and shouted at the top of his voice to promote "the way of kings," which is opposing the proletarian dictatorship and attempting to restore the bourgeois dictatorship.

    If we compare Deng Tuo's above statements with the reactionary statements of the Khrushchev revisionists, his anti-Party face will be even more exposed.

    Khrushchev revisionists incited: "It is necessary to more bravely and resolutely expose the dogmatic theory about the absurd and unfounded competition of 'West Wind and East Wind'"; Deng Tuo said that "East Wind" and "West Wind" are "clich√©s."

    Khrushchev revisionists slandered us for "shouting world revolution day and night, shouting down with US imperialism," as "using empty incantations, sonorous words and waving swords made of cardboard"; Deng Tuo said that the slogan "East Wind" is "benefactor" and "West Wind" is "enemy," is "useless" empty talk.

    Khrushchev revisionists used the slogan of opposing "personal cult" to oppose Marxist-Leninist parties and Marxist-Leninists all over the world, and carried out subversive activities against the proletarian state. Deng Tuo, who was hostile to the masses and did not understand what "the wisdom of the masses" was, actually said arrogantly that our Party "relies on its own wisdom" and "does not pay attention to the wisdom of the masses." This is nothing more than repeating the old tune of the Khrushchev revisionists slandering us, and cooperating with the Khrushchev revisionists' subversive activities against us.

    Domestic and foreign enemies carried out subversive activities against us, adopted peaceful evolution methods, and attempted to implement a counter-revolutionary restoration; while Deng Tuo wanted to replace the proletarian dictatorship with the bourgeois dictatorship, wanted our Party to "take complete rest," and let them, these revisionists, take over.

    Deng Tuo is the echo of the Khrushchev revisionists. What Deng Tuo said is what Khrushchev said. What Deng Tuo wanted to do is the activities of restoring capitalism that the Khrushchev revisionists did in the Soviet Union.

      A mayfly trying to shake a big tree, opposing the Party's general line, attacking the Great Leap Forward

    Deng Tuo used the so-called storytelling method to launch one poisonous arrow after another at the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Great Leap Forward in essays such as "The Theory of Cherishing Labor Power," "The Scam of Gold and Swords," "The Story of Talking Big," "This Year's Spring Festival," and "Plain Boiled Water is the Best Drink."

    In 1961, Deng Tuo told two foreign fable stories in the *Beijing Evening News*. One was about an athlete who liked to brag, and the other was about a titmouse bragging that it would dry up the sea water.

    At the same time as "Two Foreign Fables," Deng Tuo shot another poisonous arrow at our socialist revolutionary cause: "The Fortune of an Egg."

    The material for this essay was copied from Ming Dynasty writer Jiang Yingke's *Xuetao Novel*. The story is about a person whose entire fortune consisted of a single egg he picked up. This person imagined that the egg would hatch into a chicken, the chicken would lay eggs, he would sell the chickens to buy a cow, the cow would give birth to more cows, multiplying several times, and finally he even planned to take a concubine. As a result, his wife became "extremely angry" and "smashed his entire fortune with one fist."

    After telling this story, Deng Tuo asked: "Don't you think this story can explain many problems?" What exactly does it explain? Deng Tuo continued: Although this person knew that "it would take ten years to earn this fortune," "his plan had no reliable basis at all," "replacing reality with fantasy," "daydreaming," so that "this fortune of one egg was completely destroyed."

    In these so-called "stories," Deng Tuo said three things: (1) The "great plans" of the athlete, the titmouse, and the person with only one egg were all "boasting"; (2) they exaggerated the role of "psychological factors," thinking that they could "do whatever they wanted" based on "psychological factors," and as a result, they "ran into a brick wall in the face of reality," declaring "bankruptcy" and "complete collapse"; (3) after the bragging was exposed, the "deceived people" should not "easily let go of the bragging cheaters."

    Is Deng Tuo really telling a story here? No.

    All fables have implied meanings. The title of the story told by Jiang Yingke is called *Wangxin*, which satirizes those "who have early plans in their minds, hoping for unexpected things," that is, satirizing those who hope to realize their goals sooner and faster. Deng Tuo also repeatedly enlightened readers in the article to understand the real significance of these stories. He said: "If you have the ability to understand by analogy," then "these fables obviously contain profound meanings" and can explain the "many problems" of today; "the facts clearly prove" that "even today, such bragging figures can be encountered anytime and anywhere." He also pointed his finger and said: "Please, did you hear the titmouse bragging? Did you see someone going to a banquet with a spoon?" Look, Deng Tuo is using this challenging tone to announce that the stories he told are purposeful, and his purpose is to attack the Party's general line and attack the Great Leap Forward.

    Under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the people of the whole country demanded to quickly change our country's backward face of poverty and blankness, and to build our country into a socialist modernized power in a not too long historical period. Imperialists once ridiculed us, saying that we were "talking big" and "bragging." When our country suffered temporary economic difficulties, imperialists clamored that China's Great Leap Forward had "failed" and attacked our socialist construction for "collapsing." And the stories told by Deng Tuo are to attack our general line and the Great Leap Forward as "talking big," "boasting," "daydreaming," "replacing reality with fantasy," and as a result, "running into a brick wall" and "destroying" all of their poor belongings.

    What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class says what kind of words. Khrushchev revisionists attacked our general line and the Great Leap Forward as "a dangerous road of experimentation," "subjectivism and voluntarism in the economy," and suffered a "complete failure." Deng Tuo's attack on us is exactly the same as the attack by the Khrushchev revisionists.

    Our Party has already forcefully refuted the shameless slander of domestic and foreign class enemies. Our Party said: Is it impossible for us to build our country into a socialist modernized power with the speed of the Great Leap Forward? Is it bragging and firing cannons? No, it is possible. It is neither bragging nor firing cannons. Just look at our history and you will know. Haven't we basically overthrown the seemingly powerful imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in our country? Haven't we reached a considerable level in all aspects of socialist revolution and socialist construction after more than ten years of hard work from a base of poverty and blankness? Haven't we also exploded the atomic bomb? The emergence of the Great Leap Forward in China is an inevitable trend that cannot be blocked by any reactionary forces.

    Those who "ran into a brick wall" in the face of facts are not us, but the domestic and foreign class enemies, a small handful of right-leaning opportunists, namely revisionists.

    It should be pointed out that Deng Tuo did not just scold the Party's general line and the Great Leap Forward, he stirred up trouble in a fierce manner saying "Now that the boasting has been exposed, the deceived people will never easily let go of the bragging cheaters," that is to say, he wanted to gather ghosts and monsters to overthrow our Party and the proletarian dictatorship. We still have to treat him in the same way he treats us. According to Deng Tuo's own words, now that the face of this political swindler has been exposed by everyone, we must never let him go easily!

      Defending the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office, singing praises to them

    Deng Tuo's above-mentioned remarks attacking the Party and attacking the general line are completely right-leaning opportunist, namely revisionist, remarks. It has now been found that in 1957, before the anti-Rightist struggle, Deng Tuo published many anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois rightist remarks. Deng Tuo is a rightist who slipped through the net. In 1959, he was dismissed from office and removed from the important work he was doing in the *People's Daily*. Deng Tuo cried out for injustice for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office, and at the same time, he was also crying out for injustice for himself.

    After Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* came out, Deng Tuo suddenly felt ancient sorrows and wrote an article *Defending Li Sancai*.

    Deng Tuo said that Li Sancai "is a positive historical figure," and Li Sancai's heroic deeds of "attacking the dark feudal politics" were "buried," which is something that makes people "feel regretful." Deng Tuo not only felt extremely sorry for Li Sancai's so-called injustice, but also became very emotional when he talked about it. Who exactly is Li Sancai, and why did Deng Tuo want to defend him?

    Li Sancai was a bureaucrat during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, who served as the governor of Fengyang and the minister of the Ministry of Revenue. He was a butcher whose hands were stained with the blood of peasant insurgents, a loyal slave of the landlord class, and a mortal enemy of the people, not a "positive figure" at all.

    The reason why Deng Tuo was interested in Li Sancai, who had been dead for hundreds of years, was because he had been dismissed from office. When Li Sancai was the minister of the Ministry of Revenue, he wanted to squeeze into the "cabinet." Shao Fuzhong, the director of the Ministry of Works, and others impeached Li Sancai for "being a great traitor who looks like a loyalist, and a great fraud who looks like a honest man, listing the four major crimes of greed, hypocrisy, danger, and tyranny." Li Sancai was forced to "resign." When he was living at home, censor Liu Guangfu accused him of "stealing imperial wood to privately build a camp," which caused another dispute. As a result, Li Sancai was "dismissed (that is, dismissed from office) as a commoner." The *History of the Ming Dynasty*'s comment on Li Sancai is: "Talented but fond of using tricks, good at co-opting court officials... by nature unable to maintain integrity, therefore destroyed by the public," "The world considers Sancai to be virtuous."

    The author of the *History of the Ming Dynasty* completely wrote in a tone of defending Li Sancai. Therefore, according to the history books, Li Sancai has no injustice and does not need to be defended. However, Deng Tuo was indignant for Li Sancai and wanted to reverse the verdict for him. He said, "Li Sancai repeatedly submitted memorials... It seems that he is justified, but the Wanli court dared not thoroughly investigate this fact. What is the truth of the matter? Isn't it very clear?"

    The matter of Li Sancai "stealing imperial wood" was investigated and found to be true according to the *History of the Ming Dynasty*, and Li Sancai was "dismissed as a commoner." What is strange is that Deng Tuo was so angry when writing this article. He ignored the records in the *History of the Ming Dynasty*, added embellishments, deliberately made waves, and insisted that Li Sancai "is justified," while the court "dared not thoroughly investigate."

    The truth of the matter is indeed very clear: the "Li Sancai" in Deng Tuo's pen is "Hai Zhongjie," that is, "Hai Rui," who are the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office by us. The reason why Deng Tuo described a butcher who suppressed peasant uprisings as a good official who spoke for the people and benefited the people, and defended his dismissal from office, was to cry out for injustice for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office. What Deng Tuo said was "justified" is the so-called anti-Party backbone. However, right-leaning opportunists are guilty in front of the people and in front of the Party. They are by no means "justified." They have long been "setting in the west, and their breath is dying."

    Deng Tuo also wrote an article *Zheng Banqiao and "Banqiao Style"*. The poem at the beginning of the article was written in 1961, of which four lines are: "A paintbrush is a historical pen; ten folk songs express the emotions of heaven and earth. Taking off the black gauze hat reveals the true face; splashing the ink dry is a lifetime." What is the whole article about? It is about Zheng Banqiao "losing his black gauze hat." He repeated again and again "dismissal from office": Zheng Banqiao "completely stood on the side of the people, seeking benefits for the disaster-stricken masses, and angered the feudal bureaucrats," therefore, "he was dismissed from office"; the ruling class "completely listened to the slanders of the local gentry and landlords," which finally made "Zheng Banqiao dismissed from office"; "after being dismissed from office," his thinking style became "more and more distinct."

    Deng Tuo also quoted a poem by Zheng Banqiao inscribed on his painting *Deep Mountain Orchid and Bamboo*: "Orchids are seen on the cliffs of deep mountains, and a few pieces of cold bamboo shadows are Xiao Xiao. It is necessary to take off the black gauze hat early, so that you can lie on a high pillow in the middle," and said, this painting was painted when he did not want to be an official. "If you compare the artistic conception in this painting with the official life experienced by the painter at that time, isn't its theme thought obvious?" That is to say, the theme thought of *Deep Mountain Orchid and Bamboo* is "It is necessary to take off the black gauze hat early," which is "dismissal from office."

    There is no doubt that the central idea of this article is to promote Zheng Banqiao's "proud bones" that he still did not succumb to "after being dismissed from office."

    In 1961, Deng Tuo also complained about the dismissal of Mi Wanzhong and Li Shan. He said that Mi Wanzhong was "a man of great integrity," "honest in politics, caring about people's criminal punishment," and repeatedly commented on current affairs, which was highly praised by the middle and lower classes of the people, so he was "dismissed from office." Said that Li Shan "was jealous of by a group of powerful figures, resulting in dismissal"; "the poem "two times in the scientific examination and one time in demotion" reflects Li Shan's "resentful and unfair mood."

    Obviously, Deng Tuo is using the spirits of these landlord classes to express his infinite sympathy for the right-leaning opportunists who were dismissed from office, and the words reveal his deep-seated hatred for the Party. In 1963, when our Party launched a counterattack against the ghosts and monsters who were launching a rampant offensive against the Party and socialism, Deng Tuo further called out through Zheng Banqiao's mouth: "Could it be that Heaven still holds back hate in its mouth, and does not allow a long sigh or two." This shows how deep his hatred is.

    After being dismissed from office in 1959, Deng Tuo wrote such a poem:

    Writing vigorously for twenty years, clearly neither dream nor smoke.
    Articles full of paper are the burden of scholars, comrades in arms who share the same boat in wind and rain are virtuous.
    Counting fingers should know the merits and demerits, caring most about the latter competing for the first.
    All my life I have won heroism, and the high tide of the whole country looks up to the sky.

    From this poem, it can be clearly seen that he himself was dismissed from office and harbored strong hatred for the Party. In this poem, Deng Tuo stubbornly expressed himself, defended himself, slandered the Party for not distinguishing his "merits" and "demerits"; Deng Tuo's "heroism" is the anti-Party "proud bones," the so-called "competing for the first," is waiting for the opportunity, attempting to make a comeback.

    From 1961 to 1963, the reason why Deng Tuo vigorously praised the "backbone" of those who were dismissed from office but did not succumb, on the one hand, was to echo Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* and closely cooperate to sing praises to the right-leaning opportunists; on the other hand, to vent his hatred for the Party and reverse the verdict for himself, attacking the Party.
	      Not allowed to slip away!

    Deng Tuo confessed that he understands "deceiving the heavens and crossing the sea," "borrowing a corpse to revive the soul," "muddling the waters to fish," "pointing at the mulberry and scolding the locust," "feigning foolishness," "hiding a knife in a smile," "creating something out of nothing," "ambushing on ten sides," and "bluffing" and other "conspiracies." He knew that going into battle naked was very "dangerous," so he always "went into battle fully armed." When he thought the time was favorable, he would attack fiercely. When he thought the time was unfavorable, he would prepare to slip away. Deng Tuo and his "brothers" in "Three-Family Village" are indeed a group of political conspirators.

    Deng Tuo and his gang grasped class struggle very tightly. They engaged in vicious struggle with the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao.

    In June 1959, before the Lushan Conference, Wu Han, the vanguard of anti-Party and anti-socialist forces, released the big poisonous weed *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*, viciously cursing the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. After the Lushan Conference, another big poisonous weed *On Hai Rui* was released immediately. In order to cooperate with the right-leaning opportunist reversal offensive, in early 1961, Wu Han "broke out" and shot a big poisonous arrow *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* at the Party and socialism. In March 1961, Deng Tuo, the main general of the "Three-Family Village," "mounted the horse," and *Yanshan Night Talks* was staged. A few months later, Meng Chao's *Li Huiniang* and Tian Han's *Xie Yaohuan* were released at the same time. On October 12, 1961, Deng Tuo said the following black words in his essay *The Season for Planting Late Cabbage*: "I hope to be able to unite several gardening enthusiasts to do a small experiment with me: now sow the seeds of Chinese cabbage on the edge of the ground in front of my door, and strive to grow another crop of Chinese cabbage before the frost. Although this batch of Chinese cabbage cannot grow very large, it is also possible to have considerable harvest. Gaining some experience in this way will be more useful." As soon as the main general gave the order, in the same year and the same month, the "Three-Family Village" black inn opened in *Frontline*. In May 1962, after gaining "experience," they united another group of "gardening enthusiasts" and sowed another batch of "late cabbage"‚Äî"Changduanlu."

    For a time, a dark cloud appeared in the sky. Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Liao Mosha, Meng Chao, Xia Yan and others colluded with each other, formed a gang, opened special columns in *Frontline*, *Beijing Daily*, *Beijing Evening News* and the supplements of the *People's Daily*, addressed each other as brothers, talked long and short, and spread a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds. Ghosts and monsters came out one after another. They were blinded by greed, thought that the time had come, and arrogantly proposed that our Party must quickly "take complete rest" and use sticks to beat the revolutionaries to death.

    However, they completely misjudged the situation.

    In September 1962, our Party held the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. At the meeting, Chairman Mao further elaborated on his theory of classes and class struggle in socialist society, which he had put forward long ago, and taught us to carry out the class struggle of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's teachings, like a spring thunder, immediately brightened people's eyes. In this situation, Deng Tuo felt that the situation was not good, so he came up with a delaying tactic. He published an advertisement called *A Message to Readers*, saying that "due to recently turning the attention of amateur activities to other aspects, I no longer write *Yanshan Night Talks*." "It is not too late to write again when there is something to be learned in the future that must be written." It is clear that it was because the situation was unfavorable to them after the Tenth Plenary Session that the "Night Talks" were "dismounted," but he said that "attention was turned to other aspects." This is completely a set of deceptive lies. But on the other hand, he also hinted that once the opportunity came, when it was "impossible not to write," he would write again. The "Night Talks" were temporarily "dismounted," and the "Three-Family Village" black inn continued to "operate," observing the situation and waiting for the opportunity to move.

    In November 1965, Comrade Yao Wenyuan exposed that Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* was a big poisonous weed. Deng Tuo then hurriedly came on stage and wrote an article *From 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office' to 'Moral Inheritance Theory'*, ostensibly criticizing Wu Han, but actually defending Wu Han. They tried to muddle through.

    How did Deng Tuo's article defend Wu Han?
