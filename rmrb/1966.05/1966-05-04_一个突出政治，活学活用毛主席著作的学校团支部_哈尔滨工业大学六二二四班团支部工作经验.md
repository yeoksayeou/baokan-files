    Editor's Note: In order to promote the in-depth development of the nationwide youth movement to study Chairman Mao's works, the Communist Youth League Central Committee introduces today the experience of the Youth League Branch of the Fourth Grade of the Fourth Specialty of the Second Department of Harbin Institute of Technology for the Youth League organizations and students of universities and middle schools across the country to study.
    The CYL Central Committee added an instruction when introducing the experience of this Youth League branch. The instruction stated, "Our country now has more than 10 million young people studying in universities and middle schools. This is a great achievement brought about by our revolution. Our schools are socialist schools and must draw a clear line between capitalist, feudalist, and modern revisionist educational ideologies, resolutely carry out socialist education revolution, and run schools according to Mao Zedong Thought. Cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, and creating millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is the fundamental goal of our schools."
    The instruction stated, "Achieving this goal is not easy. Because on the education front, there is also the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, and this struggle is still long-term, complex, and fierce. All kinds of bourgeois ideas are still stubbornly influencing all aspects of our school education. The task of the school's Communist Youth League organization is to resolutely implement the Party's education policy under the leadership of the Party, fight against the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and guide students to advance in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao."
    The instruction pointed out, "The sharp weapon for guiding young students to fight against bourgeois ideas and advancing them on the road of revolution is the great Mao Zedong Thought. The Fourth Grade Youth League Branch of the Fourth Specialty of the Second Department of Harbin Institute of Technology uses this weapon to firmly grasp the fundamental issue of establishing a proletarian world view, strengthen the education of students on class and class struggle, guide students to resolutely integrate with workers and peasants, establish the purpose of studying for the revolution and serving the people wholeheartedly, greatly promote proletarian ideology, greatly eliminate bourgeois ideology, and enable students to achieve lively, active, and initiative development in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness."
    The instruction stated, "We hope that the Communist Youth League organizations in universities and middle schools across the country will seriously study and research the experience of this Youth League branch, proceed from their own reality, and strive to build all Youth League branches into schools for creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought."
    The Fourth Grade of the Fourth Specialty of the Second Department of Harbin Institute of Technology (hereinafter referred to as Class Six-Two-Two-Four) was a relatively poor class when it enrolled in 1962. At that time, the political atmosphere was not strong and discipline was lax. The Youth League branch was not very good at its work, once setting up four "centers" and making "ten resolutions" at a meeting. However, over the past three years, under the cultivation of the Party, this class has become an advanced class. Students creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform their ideology for the revolution, study diligently for the revolution, and exercise for the revolution, striding forward on the road of being both red and expert. At the time of enrollment, there were only fifteen Youth League members in the class. Now, all thirty-seven students in the class wear the Youth League badge, and seven of them have joined the Party.
    The characteristics of the work of this Youth League branch are: they highlight politics in all their work, are good at grasping living ideas, guide students to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to solve some fundamental problems in their growth process, and promote ideological revolutionization; they pay attention to putting ideological work into the field of professional study, guide students to lead with redness and strive to be both red and expert; they care for, help, and unite every student with full revolutionary enthusiasm, adhere to praise as the main method, positive education as the main method, and mass self-education as the main method, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of every student.
    I. Guiding Students to Establish Revolutionary Direction and Take the Road of Integrating with Workers and Peasants
    Why go to college? When they first entered school, the students in this class had all kinds of ideas. Some regarded going to college as a "great starting point" for fame and success; some were to "rock a few times in the 'cradle of engineers'"; some rejoiced that they could get rid of the countryside and physical labor by getting into college; some were wholeheartedly thinking of repaying "the kindness of their parents," writing in a letter to their mother: "Wait! ... Take care of your health, and happiness will come in five years!"
    What is the problem? Under the education of the Party, the Youth League branch understood that these problems are ultimately a reflection of class struggle in society among students. To solve these problems, it is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, first start with class education, fundamentally improve class consciousness, and focus on the question of who to study for and who to serve to help students recognize the direction and path of the revolution.
             Class Education is a Fire
    If you don't understand class, if you don't understand exploitation, you don't understand revolution. When the school carried out the study of "On Khrushchev's Phony Communism and Its Historical Lessons for the World - The Ninth Comment on the Open Letter of the Central Committee of the CPSU" in 1964, the Youth League branch, under the leadership of the Party organization, vigorously grasped class education.
    About half of the students in this class came from working people's families, and many of their families had a history of blood and tears. The Youth League branch organized a "recall bitterness and think about sweetness" meeting, inviting students from worker and poor peasant families to talk about their family history. Song Shihe, the former Youth League branch secretary from a poor peasant family, had his mother and grandmother forced to death by the landlord when he was four years old, and his father was paralyzed by Japanese devils who seized him for forced labor. At that time, he went out to beg for food with his older sister and brother. The landlord's young master sent dogs to bite them, scolding them as "little poor beggars." He said, "Once, we got a piece of cornmeal cake, we were so hungry, but in order to leave it for my dad who was paralyzed on the bed, we didn't want to eat it. When we got home, my dad looked at our pitiful appearance and told us to eat it. We let my dad eat it, and as we let each other, we all started crying..." Ding Xiumei, who came from a worker's family, had nine family members die tragically in the old society. Many students cried as they listened. The Youth League branch also invited veteran workers to give reports and discussions, and organized students to visit the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization" to see the exhibition of crime evidence. The bloody scenes of the old society caused a strong shock in the students' minds, arousing their boundless hatred for the old social system of exploitation and their infinite love for the Party and socialism.
    Then, the Youth League branch, in response to the idea of some students that class struggle was a thing of the past, and that the school was "calm and peaceful, where is there class struggle?", organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's expositions on class and class struggle, watch the dramas "Never Forget Class Struggle" and "The Younger Generation," and other works, to make students further realize that in socialist society, there is still acute and complex class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and this struggle is right around them, and they are the object of contention. Everyone looked for class imprints on themselves. One student from an old intellectual family was asked by his father when he was a child, "What do you want to do when you grow up?" He said, "Drive a train," and was immediately beaten and scolded by his father: "Who told you to be a stinky worker?" When he failed to get into junior high school, his father locked him up at home and made him kneel. He thought: Isn't this the bourgeoisie trying to seize me? He firmly stated that he wanted to draw a clear line between his ideology and his family, stand on the side of the proletariat, and become a revolutionary successor.
    Class education is a fire, illuminating the students' eyes, igniting their revolutionary enthusiasm, and making them understand that to make revolution, to engage in class struggle, they must transform their world view. Some students said: "Now there is a battle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology in my mind, and it is no longer as peaceful as it used to be!"
            Grasp Living Ideas, Promote Proletarian Ideology and Eliminate Bourgeois Ideology
    In order to help students solve the problem of who to study for, the Six-Two-Two-Four Class Youth League branch often seizes on the living ideas of students to start discussions. For example, during the "Nine Comments" study, they held two such discussions.
    Some students believed that studying for personal benefit could also lead to good learning. The Six-Two-Two-Four Class Youth League branch believed that this was a very important living idea, so they raised it for everyone to discuss. The students opened their minds, spoke freely, and debated fiercely. One view was that studying for personal benefit could also produce "strong perseverance," and anything could be accomplished. They cited some scientists in capitalist countries as examples. Another view was that studying for personal benefit always leads to gains and losses, and it is impossible to learn well at all. The two opinions were deadlocked. At this time, the Youth League branch guided everyone to consult Mao Zedong's works with this question in mind, and learned Chairman Mao's view that "without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." They also found materials from some right-wing elements among the students in 1957 for everyone to read, and invited the Party branch secretary to introduce the performance of previous graduates. In the past, some students got five points in their studies, but refused ideological transformation, and as a result, embarked on the evil path of opposing the Party and opposing socialism. There were also two examples that greatly touched the students: one student was assigned to a factory to study the improvement of a machine. Because of his serious individualism, he always wanted to work alone and become famous in one fell swoop. As a result, he shut himself in a room for four years without achieving anything. Another student was assigned to study the same project, and because of his high political ideological consciousness, he valued revolutionary interests and humbly asked the workers for advice, and solved the problem in half a year. Combining these positive and negative examples, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon for analysis, the students realized that they should not leave the class viewpoint and the premise of "who to serve, who is it beneficial to" to talk about what is good learning and what is not. If a person does not have the idea of serving the people, even if he learns some knowledge, it is impossible to serve the people well, and may even have a bad effect. Only by using proletarian politics to command professional work, establishing the idea of studying for the revolution, can we master strong skills faster and better, and can we make good contributions to building the motherland, defending the motherland, and supporting the world revolution.
    In the minds of some students, those bourgeois scientists who became famous through personal struggle are the most worthy of admiration. Some students often see photos of some bourgeois scientists in textbooks and theorems and laws named after them, and think that with knowledge, they have everything, and with knowledge, they should be superior. The Youth League branch seized on this living idea again and guided everyone to start discussions, so that the students realized that today they are able to go to college and learn some knowledge, which are all cultivated by workers and peasants with hard work. Workers and peasants have not only created material wealth, but also spiritual wealth. Intellectuals can only play their role and make due contributions if they root themselves in the workers and peasants, serve the workers and peasants, and learn from the workers and peasants. Separating from the workers and peasants will lead to nothing.
                Find Answers Among the Workers and Peasants
    The students have some preliminary understanding of the issue of who to study for and who to serve. However, to truly solve these problems, they must go to the workers and peasants and be tempered in the three great revolutionary movements.
    Last August, the whole class went to the countryside to participate in the socialist education movement. The Youth League branch asked everyone to bring their own questions to find answers in actual struggle, and to further transform their subjective world in the struggle to transform the objective world. During the movement, the Youth League branch cooperated with the local Party organization to carry out ideological work on the students, often guiding them to find gaps with the poor and lower-middle peasants and learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants. After five months of the vigorous socialist education movement, the students' thoughts and feelings underwent great changes. In the past, some students always felt that "serving the people" was more abstract, while serving individuals, families, and parents was concrete. Now, they began to have the image of the poor and lower-middle peasants in their minds, "they can clearly see them with their eyes closed." The students deeply realized that the actual struggle of the workers and peasants is the "revolutionary cradle" that they should yearn for, and the broad masses of working people are the mothers who nurture their growth. The working people raise themselves, but they study for personal benefit, which is so shameful! Studying for the broad masses of working people, studying to completely change the poor and blank face of the motherland, this is in line with the requirements of the times, and this is the most powerful motivation for learning! Wang Shiying said: "In the past, we argued in school about 'who contributes more, workers, peasants, or scientists'. This is the result of living in school for a long time and being divorced from productive labor and the working people. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants support us in going to college. We have just learned a little knowledge and want to compare contributions with workers and peasants. It is really too wrong!" Liu Wenqi used to say: "Students, students, studying is for life." Now, he has completely different explanations for the word "student": "Students, students, study for the revolution, live for the people." Everyone made up their minds to study for the workers and peasants for a lifetime and serve the workers and peasants for a lifetime!
    II. Guiding Students to Study Vigorously and Actively for the Revolution
    In the past, the Six-Two-Two-Four Class Youth League branch did not dare to focus on study, fearing that it would "lead the students to the evil path of being only expert and not red." Even if they did focus on it, they focused more on methods and less on ideology, with little effect. Especially when it came to exams, politics "gave way." "During the review period, no politics is discussed, news and current events are seen again after the exam." After studying the "Nine Comments," the Youth League branch, according to the instructions of the Party branch, paid attention to highlighting politics in study, and guiding students to study vigorously, actively, and on their own initiative for the revolution.
            Break Through the Shackles of Scores
    In the past, some students were shackled by scores. They said: "Scores, scores, my lifeblood." "Scores are omnipotent. With good scores, you have everything." Therefore, they were "busy and tired for scores" all day long. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on education work, the Youth League branch understood that to study well, they must see through scores and concentrate their energy on cultivating and training the ability to analyze and solve problems. Therefore, they guided the students to use Chairman Mao's instructions as a weapon to expose the harm of superstition in scores at the class meeting. Some said: "Getting a good score is for the teacher's praise, the students' praise, the parents' liking, and a good job in the future." Others said: "In order to pursue scores, we memorize by rote, guess questions during exams, ask the teacher to point out the key points, and as soon as the exam is over, we return the memorized items and papers to the teacher." Why are there these phenomena? Some believe: "Superstition in scores is all caused by the examination system. It is not our fault." Others believe: "The examination system certainly has an impact, but shouldn't our own individualism and wrong understanding in our minds be solved by ourselves?" The latter opinion was very enlightening to everyone, and the students realized that to break the concept of superstition in scores, they must eliminate all kinds of individualism and further establish the idea of studying for the revolution.
    In order to stimulate the students' revolutionary sense of responsibility, guide them to establish great ambitions, stand firm, and study hard for the revolution, the Youth League branch continued to firmly carry out situation education. They invited people to talk about the heroic killing of enemies in the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and organized students to visit the exhibition of American imperialist crimes of aggression against Vietnam. Everyone said indignantly: "American imperialism relies on its planes flying high and its warships running fast to bully the revolutionary people of the world. We are studying power, why can't we get it up, surpass the enemy, and overwhelm the enemy?" "The enemy sharpens their knives, we must also sharpen our knives." The students called the group meetings to summarize professional studies "knife sharpening meetings." A good atmosphere of unprecedented hard study and research appeared. In the past, once the exam was over, everything was fine, but after this "Engineering Thermodynamics" exam, in order to learn more knowledge, many students asked the teacher to come up with some so-called "cunning problems" accumulated over the years, and started doing them that night.
    The most prominent change in breaking the superstition of scores was Liang Xiuzhen. This student, who got the most five points in the class, has always been: she works hard on things that can get scores, and copes with things that are not scored. As a result, the more she learned, the more dead her knowledge became, and her hands-on ability was very poor. Once, she actually used a thermocouple to measure her body temperature to be 16 degrees Celsius, and could not find out the reason, and she was very distressed. Under the inspiration of the Youth League branch, she reviewed the learning path she had taken, and realized that the reason for the joke was not accidental, but the result of pursuing scores and learning not being solid. From then on, she was no longer satisfied with getting five points, but used every opportunity to cultivate and exercise her ability to analyze and solve problems, and her studies greatly improved. Once she was assigned to measure the temperature of the heat exchanger, and she dealt with the thermocouple group as dense as a spider web again. Facing this arduous task, what should she do? When she thought that this was a good opportunity to learn real skills, her courage increased greatly and she faced the difficulties. She disassembled the thermocouple group and analyzed and studied them one by one, and finally found a way to measure the temperature. The Youth League branch seized on Liang Xiuzhen's transformation and carried out education to the whole class. Liang Xiuzhen said excitedly at the class meeting: "I have been a slave to scores for fifteen years, and Chairman Mao's educational thought has liberated me. I must strive hard, study hard, and master real skills and hard work to add glory to the scientific and technological cause of the motherland!"
                "Dare" Comes First, Fearless
     "Thorough materialists are fearless." This sentence has become a powerful ideological weapon for the students of Class Six-Two-Two-Four to overcome difficulties.
    In the past, some students in this class had two fears in their studies: one was fear of making mistakes, and the other was fear of difficulties. From studying Chairman Mao's teachings, the Youth League branch realized that this was mainly due to an incorrect mental state and the metaphysics at work. To solve this problem, it is necessary to arm the students with Mao Zedong Thought, establish the spirit of daring to make revolution, daring to innovate, and a rigorous scientific attitude.
    Once, in a "Heat Transfer" exercise class, when the teacher asked the students to discuss the change law of the heat release coefficient of the entrance section of the tube, Xu Wenbiao put forward an obvious wrong opinion, causing a burst of laughter, and the teacher asked: "Where is Xu Wenbiao's opinion wrong?" Everyone looked at each other, speechless. Under the teacher's inspiration, the students launched a heated discussion, the more the problem was debated, the clearer it became, and the deeper it became. As a result, not only was the problem completely clarified, but also many new problems that were extended were solved. The teacher concluded: "Xu Wenbiao played a great role in this lesson being taught well. To seek knowledge, one must have the spirit of finding the root and pursuing the bottom, and not be half-understood, and laugh it off. A lot of knowledge often quietly slipped away in a burst of laughter." These words caused the students to think deeply, and there were many discussions after class. The Youth League branch seized this opportunity and guided the students to study Chairman Mao's teaching that "error is often the precursor to correctness," and that correct things always "exist in comparison with wrong things, develop in struggle." Some students said: "Adhering to the truth and correcting errors is really the key to opening the door to lively and active learning. In the past, I didn't listen to Chairman Mao, my mind was not liberated, I was always afraid of making mistakes, and I didn't know how many good learning opportunities I had missed, and how much I had learned!" Since then, the students were no longer afraid of making mistakes. Even if they burned out a section of wire, made a mistake in an exercise, or made a mistake in the design, they never let it go, and they had to seriously analyze the reasons, learn from the experience and lessons, and turn bad things into good things.
    For students who were afraid of difficulties in their studies, the Youth League branch also armed them with Mao Zedong Thought, so that they dared to despise difficulties strategically and pay attention to difficulties tactically, straighten their waists, and move forward in the face of difficulties. Sun Zhensheng had a heavy sense of inferiority in his studies in the past, thinking that he was "stupid" and "not material for learning engineering." After finishing "Engineering Thermodynamics," the teacher asked everyone to write a summary of the course study. As soon as Sun Zhensheng heard it, he became nervous and muttered to himself: "What if I can't write it?" In the end, he didn't write the summary, but wrote a review. At this time, the Youth League branch guided him to study Chairman Mao's teaching of "four haves," so that he realized that he did not study well because he was stupid, but mainly because his mental state was not right. He thought: If I have difficulties in my studies, why can't I try to create conditions to transform the contradiction and make my studies better? Since then, he has been reinvigorated with revolutionary spirit, adopted a "tit-for-tat" approach to every difficulty in learning, tried every means to overcome it, and as a result, his studies have continued to improve. Everyone thought that the most difficult course to learn was "Aerodynamics." After hard study, he not only understood it, but also took the initiative to rewrite a lecture that the teacher had taught, and provided it to the teacher for reference.
            Theory is Linked to Practice, the More You Learn, the More Alive
    The idea of only valuing theory and neglecting practice was very prominent among some students in this class in the past. They believed that "book theory is supreme" and that "if you learn the book well, you can solve all problems"; they were not interested in practical teaching links, thinking that they "couldn't learn anything" and that it was a "waste of time."
    Last winter vacation, some students made a lot of jokes when they went to work in factories, which severely impacted this wrong idea. Several students were responsible for removing the risers of castings. They took turns swinging hammers and smashing them down, sweating all over and their hands were numb, but they didn't knock them down, so they had to go to the worker master. The master said: "How can there be risers that can't be knocked down?" Swinging the hammer and gently hitting it upwards from the side, the riser fell off. The students suddenly realized: it turned out to be the principle of "cast iron castings that are resistant to compression but not to tension" taught in "Material Mechanics." After the start of school, the Youth League branch organized students to discuss these examples at the winter vacation experience forum, and everyone deeply realized that if you stick to the book and separate from reality, the more you learn, the more stupid you become. Why is learning separated from reality? The fundamental reason is that they did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's idea that learning theory is for application, and they lacked the string of "application" in their minds, and they did not always connect every bit of knowledge they learned with the needs of socialist construction and with competing with imperialism. Then, the Youth League branch praised Fan Wenxian for being good at learning from reality. Once, the teacher asked the students to discuss the reason why the worm gear and worm gear of a new product trial-produced by a factory generated too much heat during operation. Everyone thought it was due to improper material selection. Fan Wenxian thought, is there only one reason for the heat generation? So, he went to the factory on Sunday to investigate and found that the actual situation was much more complicated than the students imagined. The reason for the excessive heat generation was not one but four. Everyone further realized that only by learning from workers and peasants, learning from practice, and linking theory with practice can we learn more and more alive.
    The students' thinking has changed, and their studies are very different from the past. In the past, design often went from book to book. Now, as soon as they get a design topic, they first run to the site, run to the laboratory, conduct actual investigations, increase perceptual knowledge, and master first-hand materials. When learning the chapter on chain transmission in the "Mechanical Parts" course, the teacher did not teach or issue handouts, and asked the students to analyze and study it themselves based on what they had learned. The students studied "On Practice," went out of the classroom, conducted investigations in bicycle parking lots and repair shops, and consulted worker masters. After comprehensive analysis, they clarified the failure form of chain transmission and derived the formulas for calculating sprockets and chains.
    Dig Out the Roots of "Knowledge is Private"
    There is also a vivid little story that reflects the Six-Two-Two-Four Class Youth League branch's ability to grasp living ideas and promote students' ideological revolutionization. Once, when making mechanical parts design, Li Ningshi looked at the drawings of the students next to him, found that his border was drawn wrong, and made corrections. Then, he found that Wang Mingxian had also drawn it wrong, and thought, don't tell him, let him be wrong! This will show that I am better than him. But then he thought, is this right? The more he thought, the more intense the ideological struggle became, and finally he told Wang Mingxian. At a group meeting, Li Ningshi took the initiative to examine his wrong thoughts. The Youth League branch believed that although this matter was small, it reflected an important issue: Is the knowledge learned used to serve the people, or is it kept as private property? On the one hand, they praised Li Ningshi for his spirit of daring to correct his mistakes and helped him further improve his understanding; on the other hand, they organized everyone to study "Serve the People" and discussed this matter. Some students said: "I can be meticulous in caring for others in life. If I tell others the experience I have gained in my professional studies, I am not very willing. This is the idea of ​​treating knowledge as private property at work, which is a mark of the bourgeoisie deeply imprinted in our minds." Some said: "The sharpshooters of the People's Liberation Army, in order to increase the strength of eliminating the enemy, unreservedly teach their shooting skills to their comrades. We learn a little more knowledge and are unwilling to tell our classmates. This is the dirty thinking of bourgeois intellectuals. It stinks very much, and we must dig out this inferior root."
    Since then, a good atmosphere of helping each other, learning from each other, and learning together has emerged in the class. Many students found that others had difficulties in their studies and went to help, or took the initiative to write down their research experience and posted it on the "Learning Garden" for everyone to refer to.
        III. The Core of the Youth League Branch Continues to Revolutionize
    Under the cultivation and education of the Party, the Youth League Committee of Class Six-Two-Two-Four insisted on creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, consciously transforming their ideology, paying attention to taking the mass line in their work, and handling affairs according to the principle of democratic centralism. After several years of efforts, the Youth League branch initially formed a leading core with good thinking, good style, and good system.
    In the first grade, the core of this class was scattered, their thinking was chaotic, and some cadres would work when they were happy, and let it go when they were unhappy. Later, under the education of the Party organization, they learned from the experience of advanced collectives such as the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" and realized that to improve the class, they must first improve the core. Therefore, the Youth League Committee and the class committee took the lead in studying Mao Zedong Thought, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to solve their own problems and promote ideological revolutionization.
    In the past, cadres only did the work of others, and rarely exposed their thoughts. Some were holding notebooks waiting to record the problems discussed by students, some were "inspecting" each group to understand the discussion situation, and some were saying a few words without pain or itch to inspire others. The students discussed: "The cadres' speeches are all 'running skin' and do not touch on the ideology." Why can't the cadres open their minds? The branch committee discussed it several times and found that there were some ideological concerns among the cadres. Some were afraid that "exposing ideological problems would lead to the organization's distrust," and some were afraid of "reducing prestige." In order to solve these problems, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on daring to expose contradictions and earnestly carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and realized that exposing ideas is a sign of wanting to make progress, and ideological problems can only be solved if they are exposed. Covering up contradictions and relaxing ideological transformation will lead to getting lost in the direction of class struggle. Cadres taking the lead means first and foremost taking the lead in transforming their ideology. After everyone's thinking was improved, they took the initiative to make examinations in front of the students, asking the students for help. The students said, "Now that the cadres have revealed their ideas, we have nothing to worry about." The whole class quickly formed a good atmosphere of everyone talking freely about their ideas and everyone consciously making revolution. The Youth League cadres realized from this that only when the cadres consciously revolutionize themselves can they drive the entire class to revolutionize themselves. Since then, they have held a democratic life meeting every once in a while, focusing on the living ideas of the Youth League Committee and the class cadres, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    During a branch committee meeting to discuss the plan to create "four goods," such a dispute occurred. Some branch committee members, without investigation and research, conceived a set of work plans and took them to the meeting for approval. Another branch committee member objected, saying: "We should first solicit more opinions from the students. Don't think that what a few people think is what it is." The two sides argued endlessly. Finally, it was decided to go to the students separately to investigate and listen to the students' opinions. Everyone put forward many good opinions and also criticized the branch committee. Some said: "The branch secretary is not democratic. He thinks of everything first and just lets us follow." Others said: "The affairs of the class are all busy by a few cadres. We are like yellow croakers, slipping by!" These criticisms greatly shocked the Youth League Committee and realized that in work, it is necessary to implement democratic centralism, and it is absolutely impossible for one person to have the final say. Only by listening carefully to all aspects of opinions can we broaden our minds, be smart, mobilize everyone's enthusiasm, and do our work well. Since then, the branch committee has fully promoted democracy when discussing work, paid attention to listening to different opinions, and encouraged everyone to finish their words.
    The cadres of this Youth League branch paid attention to overcoming some shortcomings of being divorced from the masses in a timely manner and strengthened their relationship with the students. Once, Song Shihe, the former Youth League branch secretary, wrote such a paragraph at the end of a Youth League class study group record: "You have learned very well. I hope you will overcome arrogance and rashness and continue to work hard." Below was the signature "Branch Secretary." Later, under the reminder of another branch committee member, he realized that his attitude and practice of posing as an educator was very wrong. This incident made him unable to calm down for a long time. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching on always maintaining humility, prudence, no arrogance, no rashness, and never being divorced from the masses, and decided to put himself among the masses and always pay attention to overcoming the bourgeois idea of being superior. He took the initiative to make an examination at the Youth League branch meeting. From then on, he treated the students equally, helped each other and learned from each other, and no longer posed as a cadre. Other Youth League committee members and class committee members were also greatly educated by Song Shihe's example. They realized that the students chose themselves to be cadres, and they can only rely on the students everywhere and serve the students well, and they must not be divorced from the masses.
    After several years of cultivation by the Party and practical work experience, the Youth League cadres of Class Six-Two-Two-Four have grown up batch by batch, and many people have become activists in studying Chairman Mao's works in the school and department. They set an example in everything and united all the students in the class to move forward together. In this class, everyone is willing to speak their minds, dare to raise opinions, feel comfortable, and strive to be better. The students said: "In our class, everyone cares about one person's affairs, everyone cares about collective affairs, there are no people who specialize in helping others, and there are no people who specialize in being helped by others. Everyone is ore, everyone is coke. If they are ore, they must be smelted in the revolutionary furnace; if they are coke, they must emit their own light and heat to smelt every piece of ore."

    一个突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的学校团支部
    ——哈尔滨工业大学六二二四班团支部工作经验
    编者按：共青团中央为了推动全国青年学习毛主席著作运动的深入发展，今天介绍了哈尔滨工业大学二系四专业四年级团支部的经验，让全国大、中学校的团组织和学生们学习。
    团中央在介绍这个团支部的经验时加了批语。批语说，“我们的国家现在已经有一千多万青年在大、中学校学习。这是我国革命带来的伟大成果。我们的学校是社会主义的学校，必须同资本主义、封建主义、现代修正主义的教育思想划清界限，坚决进行社会主义的教育革命，按照毛泽东思想办学校。培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人，这就是我们学校的根本目标。”
    批语说，“要实现这个目标，是很不容易的。因为在教育战线上，同样存在着无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，这个斗争还是长期的、复杂的、激烈的。形形色色的资产阶级思想还在顽强地影响着我们学校教育的各个环节。学校共青团组织的任务，就是要在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党的教育方针，同资产阶级的思想影响作斗争，引导学生按照毛主席所指引的方向前进。”
    批语指出，“引导青年学生向资产阶级思想作斗争，使他们在革命化道路上前进的锐利武器，就是伟大的毛泽东思想。哈尔滨工业大学二系四专业四年级团支部就是运用这个武器，紧紧抓住树立无产阶级世界观这个根本问题，加强对学生的阶级和阶级斗争教育，引导学生坚决同工农结合，树立为革命而学习、全心全意为人民服务的目的，把政治工作做到每个同学身上去，大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想，使学生在德智体诸方面得到生动活泼的主动的发展。”
    批语说，“我们希望全国大、中学校的共青团组织，认真地学习和研究这个团支部的经验，从自己的实际出发，为把所有团支部都办成活学活用毛泽东思想的学校而努力。”
    哈尔滨工业大学二系四专业四年级（以下简称六二二四班）一九六二年入学时是一个较差的班。当时，政治空气不浓，纪律涣散。团支部也不大会做工作，曾经一次会上布置四个“中心”，作出“十项决议”。但是，三年多来，在党的培育下，这个班已经变成为一个先进班级。同学们活学活用毛主席著作，为革命改造思想，为革命勤奋学习，为革命锻炼身体，在又红又专的大道上阔步前进。入学时，班上只有十五名团员。现在，全班三十七人都带上了团徽，其中七个同学入了党。
    这个团支部工作的特点是：他们在一切工作中突出政治，善于抓活思想，引导同学以毛泽东思想为武器，解决自己成长过程中一些带根本性的问题，促进思想革命化；他们注意把思想工作做到业务学习领域中去，引导同学以红带专，努力做到又红又专；他们怀着满腔的革命热情去关心、帮助、团结每一个同学，坚持以表扬为主，以正面教育为主，以群众的自我教育为主，充分调动每个同学的积极性。
    一、引导同学确立革命的方向，走
        同工农结合的道路
    为什么上大学？刚入学的时候，这个班的同学有各种各样的想法。有的把上大学当作成名成家的“伟大起点”；有的是为了“到‘工程师的摇篮’里摇几摇”；有的庆幸自己考上大学就可以脱离农村和体力劳动；有的一心想着报答“父母之恩”，在给母亲的信里写道：“等着吧！……望您保重身体，五年后，幸福就会来临！”
    这是什么问题？在党的教育下，团支部懂得了：这些问题，归根到底是社会上阶级斗争在同学中的反映，要解决这些问题，必须以毛泽东思想为武器，首先从阶级教育入手，从根本上提高阶级觉悟，围绕着为谁学习、为谁服务的问题，帮助同学们认清革命的方向和道路。
              阶级教育是把火
    不懂得阶级，不懂得剥削，就不懂得革命。在一九六四年学校开展《关于赫鲁晓夫的假共产主义及其在世界历史上的教训——九评苏共中央的公开信》的学习时，团支部在党组织的领导下狠抓了阶级教育。
    这个班的同学约有半数出身于劳动人民家庭，许多人家里都有一本血泪史。团支部组织了一次“忆苦思甜”会，请工人、贫农家庭出身的同学讲家史。贫农家庭出身的原团支部书记宋士合，四岁时母亲和奶奶就被地主逼死，父亲被日本鬼子抓劳工而瘫痪。当时他就跟着姐姐哥哥外出讨饭。地主少爷赶狗来咬他们，骂他们“小穷要饭花子”。他说：“有一次，我们要到一块苞米面饼子，馋得要命，但为了留给瘫在炕头的爸爸，没有舍得吃，到家后，爸爸看着我们可怜的样子，让我们吃，我们又让爸爸吃，让着让着就是一片哭声……”工人家庭出身的丁秀梅，全家有九口人惨死在旧社会。许多同学一面听一面流泪。团支部还请老工人作报告、座谈，组织同学参观“中美合作所”罪证展览。旧社会血泪斑斑的图景，在同学们思想上引起了强烈的震动，激起了他们对旧社会剥削制度的无比仇恨和对党对社会主义的无限热爱。
    接着，团支部又针对有些同学认为阶级斗争是过去的事，学校里“风平浪静，哪里有阶级斗争？”的思想，组织大家反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，看话剧《千万不要忘记》、《年青的一代》等，使同学们进一步认识到：在社会主义社会里，还存在着无产阶级和资产阶级之间尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，而且这种斗争就在自己的身边，自己就是被争夺的对象。大家纷纷找自己身上的阶级烙印。有个旧知识分子家庭出身的同学，小时候父亲问他：“长大了干什么？”他说：“开火车”，立即遭到父亲打骂：“谁叫你当臭工人？”他没有考上初中，父亲就把他关在家里罚跪。他想：这不就是资产阶级在争夺自己吗？他坚决表示，要和家庭划清思想界限，站到无产阶级这边来，做革命接班人。
    阶级教育是把火，照亮了同学们的眼睛，点燃了同学们的革命热情，使他们懂得了：要革命，要搞阶级斗争，一定要改造自己的世界观。有的同学说：“现在在我的头脑中有兴无灭资的仗可打了，再不象过去那样平静了！”
                抓活思想，兴无灭资
    为了帮助同学解决为谁学习的问题，六二二四班团支部经常抓住同学中的活思想展开讨论。例如，在“九评”学习中，他们就搞过两次这样的讨论。
    有的同学认为，为个人学习也能学好。六二二四班团支部认为这是个很重要的活思想，就提出来让大家讨论。同学们敞开思想，各抒己见，争论得十分热烈。一种意见认为：为个人学习也可以产生“强大的毅力”，什么事都能做成。他们举出资本主义国家的一些科学家为例。另一种意见认为，为个人学习总是患得患失，根本不可能学好。两种意见相持不下。这时，团支部就引导大家带着这个问题去向毛主席著作请教，学了毛主席关于“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”的观点。他们还找来了一九五七年学生中一些右派分子的材料给大家看，并请党总支书记介绍历届毕业生的表现情况。过去，有的学生功课得五分，但是拒绝思想改造，结果走上了反党反社会主义的邪路。还有两个例子对同学们的思想触动很大：一个学生，分配到某工厂研究改进一个机器，由于他个人主义思想严重，总想自己单干，一举成名，结果关在屋里搞了四年，也没有搞出什么成绩。而另一个学生分配去研究同一个项目，由于他政治思想觉悟高，以革命利益为重，虚心向工人请教，半年就把问题解决了。结合这些正面、反面的事例，用毛主席思想为武器，进行分析，同学们认识到：不应该离开阶级观点，离开“为谁服务，对什么人有利”这个前提，去谈什么学得好和学不好的问题。一个人如果没有为人民服务的思想，即使学到一些知识，也不可能很好地为人民服务，甚至会起坏作用。只有用无产阶级政治统帅业务，树立为革命而学习的思想，才能更快更好地掌握过硬本领，才能为建设祖国、保卫祖国和支援世界革命作出很好的贡献。
    在一些同学的心目中，那些靠个人奋斗成名的资产阶级科学家是最值得崇拜的。有的同学在教科书上常看到一些资产阶级科学家的照片和用他们的名字命名的定理定律，认为有了知识就有了一切，有了知识，就应该高人一等。团支部又抓住这个活思想，引导大家展开讨论，使同学们认识到，今天自己能够上大学，能够学到一些知识，都是工农用辛勤的劳动培养的。工农不仅创造了物质财富，而且创造了精神财富。知识分子只有把根子扎到工农中去，为工农服务，向工农学习，才能发挥自己的作用，做出应有的贡献，脱离了工农，就将一事无成。
                到工农群众中去找答案
    同学们对于应该为谁学习、为谁服务的问题有了一些初步认识。但是，要真正解决这些问题，必须到工农群众中去，到三大革命运动中去经受锻炼。
    去年八月，全班同学到农村参加社会主义教育运动，团支部要求大家带着自己的问题到实际斗争中去找答案，在改造客观世界的斗争中进一步改造主观世界。在运动过程中，团支部配合当地党组织，对同学们进行思想工作，经常引导他们和贫下中农找差距，向贫下中农学习。经过五个月轰轰烈烈的社会主义教育运动，使同学们的思想感情发生了很大的变化。过去，有的同学总觉得“为人民服务”比较抽象，而为个人、家庭、父母则是具体的。现在，脑子里开始有了贫下中农的形象，“一闭眼就可以清晰地看见他们”。同学们深深体会到：工农群众的实际斗争，才是自己应该向往的“革命摇篮”，广大的劳动人民，才是哺育自己成长的母亲。劳动人民把自己养育大，自己却为个人学习，那是多么可耻啊！为广大劳动人民而学，为彻底改变祖国的一穷二白面貌而学，这才符合时代的要求，这才是最强大的学习动力！王世英说：“过去在学校里争论什么‘工人农民和科学家谁的贡献大’，这是由于长期在学校里生活，脱离生产劳动和劳动人民的结果。工人和贫下中农供养我们上大学，我们刚刚学到一点点知识，就要跟工农比贡献，实在太不应该了！”刘文奇过去常说：“学生，学生，学习就是为了生活。”现在，他对“学生”两字作了完全不同的解释：“学生，学生，学为革命学，生为人民生。”大家下定决心，要为工农学一辈子，为工农服务一辈子！
    二、引导同学为革命生动活泼地学习
    过去，六二二四班团支部不大敢抓学习，担心会“把同学引到只专不红的邪路上去”。有时即使抓了，也是抓方法多，抓思想少，收效不大。特别一到考试，政治就“让路”。“温课期间，政治莫谈，新闻时事，考完再见。”学习“九评”后，团支部根据党总支的指示，注意了在学习中突出政治，引导同学为革命生动活泼地主动地学习。
              冲破分数的束缚
    过去，有些同学被分数束缚住了。他们说：“分、分，我的命根。”“分是万能的，有了好分就有了一切。”因此，成天“为分辛苦为分忙”。学习了毛主席关于教育工作的指示后，团支部懂得了：要学好，必须把分数看透，把精力集中在培养训练分析问题和解决问题的能力上。于是，引导同学以毛主席指示为武器，在全班大会上揭露迷信分数的危害。有的说：“考个好分为的是老师夸奖，同学赞扬，父母喜欢，将来分配个好工作。”还有的说：“为了追求分数，就死记硬背，考试时猜题，要求老师指重点，考试一完，就把背的条条和卷子一起交还给老师了。”为什么会有这些现象呢？有的认为：“迷信分数全是考试制度造成的，怨不得我们。”有的则认为：“考试制度固然有影响，但是我们自己头脑中的个人主义思想、错误认识，难道不应该由我们自己来解决吗？”后一种意见，对大家很有启发，同学们认识到：要破除迷信分数的观念，必须清除形形色色的个人主义，进一步树立为革命而学习的思想。
    为了激发同学们的革命责任感，引导他们树雄心，立大志，为革命奋发学习，团支部不断抓紧进行形势教育。请人讲越南人民抗美救国斗争中英勇杀敌的故事，组织同学参观美帝侵略越南罪行展览。大家愤慨地说：“美帝国主义仗着它飞机飞得高，军舰跑得快，欺负世界革命人民。我们是学动力的，为什么不可以搞上去，超过敌人、压倒敌人呢？”“敌人磨刀，我们也要磨刀”。同学们把总结业务学习的小组会叫作“磨刀会”。学习上出现了前所未有的刻苦钻研的好风气。过去，考试一过，就万事大吉，但这次《工程热力学》考试结束后，许多同学为了学到更多的知识，又要求老师出了历届积累的一些所谓“狡猾的难题”，当天晚上就做起来。
    在破除分数的迷信上，转变最突出的是梁秀珍。这个班上得五分最多的同学，过去一直是：能得分的事就猛干，不记分的事就应付。结果，知识越学越死，动手能力很差。一次，她竟然用热电偶把自己的体温测成摄氏十六度，还找不出原因在哪里，心里很苦恼。在团支部启发下，她回顾了自己所走过的学习道路，认识到所以出笑话并不是偶然的，而是追求分数、学习不扎实的结果。从此以后，她不再满足于得五分了，而是利用一切机会培养和锻炼分析问题、解决问题的能力，学习大有进步。一次分配她测定热交换器的温度，又和密如蛛网的热电偶群打上了交道。面临着这个艰巨的任务，怎么办？她一想到这正是学真本领的好机会，就勇气大增，迎难而上。她把热电偶群拆下来，一个一个地分析研究，终于找出了测温办法。团支部抓住梁秀珍转变的事例，向全班同学进行教育。梁秀珍在班会上激动地说：“我做了十五年分数的奴隶，毛主席的教育思想使我获得了解放。我一定要奋发图强，苦学苦练，把真本领硬功夫学到手，为祖国的科学技术事业增光！”
                “敢”字当头，无所畏惧
      “彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。这句话已经成为六二二四班同学战胜困难的强大思想武器。
    过去，这个班有些同学在学习上有两怕：一怕出错，二怕困难。从学习毛主席的教导中，团支部认识到：这主要是精神状态不对头，形而上学的思想在作祟。要解决这个问题，必须用毛泽东思想武装同学，树立敢于革命，敢于创新的精神和严格的科学态度。
    一次，上《传热学》习题课，老师让同学讨论管子入口段放热系数的变化规律时，须文彪提出了一个明显的错误意见，引起哄堂大笑，老师问：“须文彪的意见究竟错在哪里？”大家却面面相觑，无言以对。在老师启发下，同学们展开了热烈讨论，问题越辩越明，越争越深，结果不仅把这个问题彻底搞清楚了，而且还把引伸出来的许多新问题也解决了。老师总结说：“这堂课所以上得好，须文彪起了很大作用。求知识要有寻根究底的精神，不能一知半解，一笑了之。很多知识往往在一阵笑声中就悄悄地滑过去了。”这些话引起了同学们的深思，课后议论纷纷。团支部抓住这个时机，引导同学学习了毛主席关于“错误常常是正确的先导”，正确的东西总是同错误的东西“相比较而存在，相斗争而发展”的教导，有的同学说：“坚持真理，修正错误，真是打开生动活泼的学习大门的钥匙。过去没有听毛主席的话，思想不解放，总怕出错，不知放过了多少好的学习机会，不知少学了多少东西！”此后，同学们不再怕出错了。那怕是烧坏了一段导线，做错了一道习题，设计中出了一点毛病，他们也从不放过，都要认真分析原因，吸取经验教训，把坏事变成好事。
    对在学习上害怕困难的同学，团支部也是用毛泽东思想武装他们，使他们敢于在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，挺起腰杆，迎着困难前进。孙振省同学过去在学习上自卑心理很重，认为自己“脑子笨”，“不是学工的材料”。《工程热力学》学完后，老师让大家写一份课程学习总结。孙振省一听就紧张了，心里直嘀咕：“写不出来可咋办？”最后，总结没写出来，却写了一份检讨书。这时，团支部引导他学习毛主席“四个有所”的教导，使他认识到：自己学习不好，并不是脑子笨，主要是精神状态不对头。他想：自己学习有困难，为什么不可以努力创造条件使矛盾转化，把学习搞好呢？从此，他振奋起革命精神，对学习中的每一个困难都采取“针锋相对”的方针，千方百计地设法战胜它，因而学习不断提高。大家认为最难学的《空气动力学》课，他经过刻苦钻研，不但理解了，而且还主动地把老师讲过的一节课的内容，重新编写了一份讲稿，供教师参考。
              理论联系实际，越学越活
    只重视理论而忽视实际的思想，过去在这个班一些同学中是很突出的。他们认为“书本理论是至高无上的”，“学好了书本，就能解决一切问题”；对实践性教学环节不感兴趣，认为“学不到东西”，是“浪费时间”。
    去年寒假，部分同学到工厂劳动时，出了不少笑话，狠狠地冲击了这种错误思想。几个同学负责打掉铸件冒口，他们交替抡锤向下猛砸，累得浑身冒汗，双手发麻，也没有打下来，只好去找工人师傅。师傅说：“哪有打不下来的冒口？”抡锤从旁边向上轻轻一击，冒口就掉下来了。同学们这才恍然大悟：原来是《材料力学》中讲的生铁铸件“抗压不抗拉”的道理。开学以后，团支部在寒假见闻座谈会上，就这些事例组织同学进行了讨论，大家深深体会到：脱离实际死抠书本，越学越蠢。为什么学习脱离实际呢？根本原因是对毛主席学习理论是为了用的思想领会不深，头脑里少了“用”这根弦，没有时时刻刻把每学一点知识都和社会主义建设的需要、和跟帝国主义较量联系起来。接着，团支部表扬了范文献善于向实际学习的事例。一次，教师让同学讨论某工厂试制的新产品运行时蜗轮蜗杆发热量过大的原因。大家认为是选材不当。范文献想，发热的原因只有一个吗？于是，他利用星期日到工厂去调查，发现实际情况比同学们设想的复杂得多，造成发热量过大的原因不是一个而是四个。大家进一步认识到：向工农学习，向实际学习，把理论和实际联系起来，才能越学越活。
    同学们的思想变了，学习也就和过去大不相同了。过去搞设计往往从书本到书本，现在一拿到设计题目，首先跑现场，跑实验室，进行实际调查，增加感性知识，掌握第一性材料。学《机械零件》课链传动这一章时，老师一不讲课，二不发讲稿，要求同学根据学过的知识自己进行分析研究。同学们学习《实践论》，走出教室，到自行车停车场和修理铺进行调查，向工人师傅请教，经过综合分析，弄清了链传动的破坏形式，得出了计算链轮和链条的公式。
    挖掉“知识
        私有”的劣根
    还有一个生动的小故事，也反映了六二二四班团支部善于抓活思想，促进同学思想革命化。一次，作机械零件设计时，李宁世看了旁边同学的图纸，发现自己的边框画错了，作了改正。接着，他发现王明贤也画错了，心想，不告诉他，错就让他错吧！这样就显出我比他强。但又一想，这样作对吗？越想思想斗争越激烈，最后还是告诉了王明贤。在一次小组会上，李宁世主动检查了自己的错误思想。团支部认为这件事虽小，但反映了一个重要问题：把学得的知识用来为人民服务，还是据为私有？他们一方面表扬了李宁世勇于改正错误的精神，帮助他进一步提高认识；另一方面，组织大家学习《为人民服务》，讨论这件事情。有的同学说：“在生活上关心别人，我可以无微不至。如果把自己的业务学习上钻研的心得告诉别人，就不大愿意。这是把知识当作私有财产的思想在作怪，是资产阶级打在我们思想深处的一个烙印。”有的说：“解放军神枪手为了多增加一份消灭敌人的力量，毫无保留地把自己的射击本领教给战友，我们多学到一点知识，就不愿告诉自己的同学，这是资产阶级知识分子的肮脏思想，臭得很，一定要挖掉这个劣根。”
    此后，班上出现了互相帮助、切磋琢磨、共同学好的好风气。很多同学发现别人学习遇到困难就去帮助，或主动把自己钻研的心得写出来，贴在“学习园地”上，供大家参考。
        三、团支部核心不断革命化
    在党的培养教育下，六二二四班的团支委，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，自觉改造思想，工作中注意走群众路线，按民主集中制原则办事。经过几年的努力，团支部初步形成了一个具有好思想、好作风、好制度的领导核心。
    一年级时，这个班核心涣散，思想混乱，有的干部高兴时就抓一下工作，不高兴就放任不管。后来，在党组织的教育下，他们学习了“南京路上好八连”等先进集体的经验，认识到：要把班级搞好，必须首先搞好核心。于是团支委和班委就带头学习毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想解决自己的问题，促进思想革命化。
    过去，干部只做别人的工作，自己很少暴露思想。有的端着笔记本等着记同学谈的问题，有的到各小组去“巡视”，了解讨论情况，有的为了启发别人，也不疼不痒地说几句。同学们纷纷议论说：“干部的发言尽‘跑皮’，不触及思想。”为什么干部的思想敞不开？支委会讨论了几次，发现干部中存在一些思想顾虑，有的怕“暴露思想问题组织不信任”，有的怕“降低威信”。为了解决这些问题，他们学习了毛主席关于勇于揭露矛盾和认真开展批评与自我批评的教导，认识到：暴露思想是要求进步的表现，思想问题只有暴露了才能解决。掩盖矛盾，放松思想改造，就会在阶级斗争中迷失方向。干部带头，首先就是要带改造思想的头。大家的思想提高以后，便主动在同学面前作了检查，要求同学帮助。同学说，“现在干部亮出了思想，我们更没有什么顾虑了。”全班很快形成了人人畅谈思想，个个自觉革命的好风气。团干部从中体会到：只有干部自觉革命化，才能带动全班同学革命化。以后，他们每隔一段时间，就针对团支委和班干部的活思想，开一次民主生活会，开展批评与自我批评。
    在一次支委会上讨论创“四好”的计划时，发生了这样一场争论。有一些支委没有经过调查研究，就设想了一套工作计划，拿到会上通过。另一个支委表示反对，说：“我们首先应该多征求同学的意见，不要几个人想个啥就是啥。”双方争执不下，最后决定分头到同学中去调查，听听同学的意见。大家提了许多好意见，同时也对支委会提出了批评。有的说：“支部书记不民主，什么事情都是他先想好了，光让我们照办。”有的说：“班上的事都是几个干部在忙，我们是属黄花鱼的，溜边！”这些批评使团支委受到很大震动，认识到：在工作中，要贯彻执行民主集中制，绝不可一个人说了算。只有各方面意见都认真听取，才能使自己思想开阔，头脑聪明，也才能调动大家的积极性，把工作做好。以后，支委会在讨论工作时，充分发扬民主，注意听取不同意见，鼓励大家把话说完。
    这个团支部的干部注意及时地克服了某些脱离群众的缺点，密切了和同学的关系。有一次，原团支部书记宋士合在一份团课学习小组的记录后面批了这样一段话：“你们学得很好，望戒骄戒躁，继续努力。”下面署名“支书”。后来，在另一个支委的提醒下，他发觉自己这种以教育者自居的态度和做法很不对。这件事，使他很久不能平静下来。他反复学习了毛主席关于永远保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁和一刻也不脱离群众的教导，决心把自己放在群众当中，时刻注意克服高人一头的资产阶级思想。他主动在团支部大会上作了检查。从此以后，他和同学平等相待，互帮互学，再不以干部自居了。其他团支委和班委从宋士合的事例中，也受到很大教育。他们认识到：同学们选自己做干部，自己只能处处依靠同学，好好为同学服务，绝不能脱离群众。
    经过几年来党的培养和实际工作的锻炼，六二二四班的团干部，一批一批地成长起来，不少人成为校、系学习毛主席著作的积极分子。他们处处以身作则，把全班同学都团结起来，共同前进。在这个班上，每个同学心里有话愿意讲，有意见敢于提，心情舒畅，奋发向上。同学们说：“在我们班上，一个人的事大家关心，集体的事人人关心，没有专门帮助别人的人，也没有专门被别人帮助的人。人人是矿石，人人是焦炭，是矿石，就要在革命熔炉中熔炼；是焦炭，就要发出自己的光和热去熔炼每一块矿石。”“在我们班上，干部相信群众，群众相信干部，大家拧成一股劲儿，在又红又专的大道上向前奔！”
