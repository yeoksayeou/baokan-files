    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - Under repeated requests from Soviet leaders, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato has indicated his willingness to visit the Soviet Union within this year.

    According to a Japan Broadcasting Association (NHK) report, Ryutaro Azuma, the Governor of Tokyo, who had just returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, reported to Sato on the 13th that Nikolai Podgorny, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, said during a meeting with him: "In order to show that friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are developing, we hope to realize mutual visits between Sato and Kosygin. Therefore, the Soviet government strongly hopes that Prime Minister Sato will visit the Soviet Union."

    Sato issued a statement on the matter that evening, saying: "Some time ago, Foreign Minister Shiina visited the Soviet Union, and soon, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko will come to Japan. After the mutual visits between the foreign ministers of the two countries, visits between the heads of government of the two countries will be realized."

    Not long ago, the Japanese newspaper *Mainichi Shimbun* revealed that "Soviet leaders are enthusiastic and serious about approaching Japan." "In the past, the Soviet Union, together with Communist China, had been opposing the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system, but it can be considered that the Soviet Union has now joined hands with Japan to adopt a strategy of containing Communist China."

    Since the new Soviet leadership came to power in 1964, the Soviet Union has formally or informally expressed its welcome to Sato's visit to the Soviet Union on many occasions. In June last year, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Kuznetsov visited Japan and brought a personal letter from Kosygin to Sato, formally extending an invitation to Sato. In January this year, when Japanese Foreign Minister Shiina visited the Soviet Union, Soviet leaders once again urged that Sato's visit to the Soviet Union be realized as soon as possible.

    苏联领导加紧勾结日本反动派反华
    佐藤表示年内将去苏联作交易
    新华社东京十四日电　在苏联领导人一再请求下，日本首相佐藤荣作表示乐于在今年年内访问苏联。
    据日本广播协会电台报道，刚刚访问苏联回国的东京都知事东龙太郎十三日向佐藤报告说，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内在会见他时说：“为了显示日苏亲善关系正在发展，希望实现佐藤和柯西金的相互访问。因此苏联政府强烈期望佐藤首相访问苏联。”
    佐藤当晚就此发表谈话说：“前些时候，外务大臣椎名访问了苏联，不久，苏联外长葛罗米柯将来日本。两国外长间的相互访问之后，将实现两国政府首脑之间的访问。”
    不久前，日本《每日新闻》透露，“苏联领导人对于接近日本，是热情而且认真的”。“过去，苏联同共产党中国一起，一直对抗日美安全条约体制，但是，可以认为，现在苏联已经同日本携起手来，采取遏制共产党中国的策略。”
    自从一九六四年苏联新领导上台以后，苏联就正式或非正式地多次表示欢迎佐藤访苏。去年六月，苏联外交部第一副部长库兹涅佐夫访问日本，又带来了柯西金给佐藤的亲笔信，正式向佐藤发出了邀请。今年一月，日本外务大臣椎名访问苏联时，苏联领导人又一次敦促早日实现佐藤访苏。
