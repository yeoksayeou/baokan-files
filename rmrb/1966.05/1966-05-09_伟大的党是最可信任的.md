    After reading Deng Tuo's anti-Party and anti-socialist black words, every revolutionary cannot but be filled with boundless indignation. The venomousness of Deng Tuo's black words and the sinister intentions are even worse than those of the anti-communist expert Wu Han, proving him worthy of being the big boss of the "Three-Family Village" black shop. Our struggle with Deng Tuo is a sharp class struggle, which must not be ignored.
    Deng Tuo slanders our Party as "untrustworthy." This is purely turning black and white upside down and frantically attacking the Party. What are the facts? From 1959 to 1961, vast areas of the country suffered continuous and severe natural disasters. At that time, the disaster in my hometown of Lankao County was even more serious. However, under the wise leadership of the Party, organizations at all levels did everything possible to carry out disaster relief and famine relief work, and did everything possible to arrange the lives of commune members. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants had boundless love and trust for the Party and Chairman Mao, and therefore had boundless confidence and strength to resist the disaster. My mother often said to me: "Our family is a poor peasant, and although life is still relatively tight now, it is much better than in the past. We must follow the Party." However, at that time, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of. A rich peasant woman said: "Don't believe the Communist Party's stuff. The weather is no longer favorable." Isn't Deng Tuo's reactionary remarks exactly the same as what this rich peasant said! It's just that Deng Tuo's methods are more sophisticated. A few flies' wings cannot cover the radiant sun. The poisoning of a small handful of anti-Party and anti-socialist elements cannot shake the boundless trust of our workers, peasants, and soldiers in the Party.
    The changes in Lankao County in recent years have more powerfully proven that the Party and Chairman Mao are the most wise and the most trustworthy. Lankao has always been a "rotten eye" county and very poor. In the winter of 1962, the Party sent the outstanding cadre Comrade Jiao Yulu to Lankao to lead the people of the county to overcome waterlogging, sandstorms, and saline-alkali soil, turning Lankao from a county that relied on state-supplied grain into a county that basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain. He received the boundless respect and trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the county. Jiao Yulu is a representative of the communists. The reason why he was able to do this was mainly because he acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and combined Mao Zedong Thought with the specific conditions of Lankao. I ask you, Deng Tuo, if the leading cadres of the great Party were "amnesiacs," could Lankao have such great changes? Your slander of the Communist Party as "amnesiacs" precisely demonstrates your reactionary thinking. It is not surprising that Deng Tuo insults and attacks our great Party in every possible way. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "For us, it is bad if a person, a party, an army, or a school is not opposed by the enemy, because that would mean that we are in the same mire with the enemy. It is good if the enemy opposes us, because it proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy. It is still better if the enemy opposes us vigorously and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue, because it proves that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between ourselves and the enemy, but that our work has been quite successful."
    Now, Deng Tuo's fox tail has been completely exposed. I am a revolutionary soldier, and we must seize it, drag it into the broad daylight, tear off his disguise, and resolutely overthrow him.

    伟大的党是最可信任的
    解放军某部五好战士　秦信礼
    看了邓拓反党反社会主义的黑话，凡是一个革命者，都不能不激起无比的愤慨。邓拓所写的黑话，词句之毒辣，居心之险恶，比起反共专家吴晗有过之无不及，不愧是“三家村”黑店里的大掌柜。我们和邓拓的斗争是一场尖锐的阶级斗争，决不可忽视。
    邓拓污蔑我们党“不堪信任”。这纯粹是颠倒黑白，狂热地向党攻击。事实是怎样的呢？一九五九年到一九六一年，全国广大地区连续遭到了严重的自然灾害。当时我的家乡兰考县的灾情更为严重。但是在党的英明领导下，各级组织千方百计地开展了抗灾救荒工作，千方百计安排社员的生活。广大贫下中农，对党、对毛主席无限热爱，无限信任，对抗灾就有了无限信心和力量。母亲常常对我说：“我们家是贫农，现在生活虽然还比较紧，比过去已经强多了，我们一定要跟着党走。”但是，当时地、富、反、坏分子却认为有可乘之机了，一个富农老婆说：“你们别信共产党那一套，天也不顺时啦。”邓拓的反动言论同这个富农分子的说法不是一模一样吗！只不过邓拓的手腕玩的高明些罢了。几只苍蝇的翅膀是遮不住光芒四射的太阳的，一小撮反党反社会主义分子的放毒，动摇不了我们工农兵对党的无限信任。
    兰考县近几年来的变化，更有力地证明：党和毛主席是最英明、最可信任的。兰考历来是个“烂眼子”县，穷的很。一九六二年冬，党派了优秀的干部焦裕禄同志来到兰考，领导全县人民战胜内涝、风沙、盐碱，使一个靠吃统销粮的兰考变成粮食基本自给的县。他受到了全县贫下中农的无限尊重和信任。焦裕禄是共产党人的代表，他所以能做到这些，主要是他按照毛主席的指示办事，把毛泽东思想同兰考具体情况结合了起来。试问邓拓，如果伟大的党的领导干部是一些“健忘症”者，兰考能有这样大的变化吗？你诬蔑共产党是“健忘症”者，正说明了你的反动思想。邓拓百般侮辱和攻击我们伟大的党是不奇怪的。毛主席早就教导我们：“对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    现在，邓拓的狐狸尾巴已经毕露了，我是一个革命战士，我们一定要揪住它，拉到光天化日之下，撕掉他的伪装，坚决把他斗垮。
