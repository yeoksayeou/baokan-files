    Popularizing Advanced Experience is a Basic Method for Achieving Increased Production and Thrift
    Northeast state-owned industrial and mining enterprises will launch a new campaign for increased production and thrift on the basis of the victory of the Three-Anti Movement. This year's task of increasing production and practicing thrift is more arduous than last year. The basic method to complete this arduous task is to earnestly and conscientiously popularize various advanced experiences.
    After three years of recovery and development, Northeast industry has seen new developments. A large number of advanced producers and advanced experiences have emerged in various industries. For example, the Cui Guoshan rapid tunneling team of the Jixi Coal Mining Bureau, the rapid overhaul method of the Fushun Power Plant, the experience of the Jixi Power Plant in burning inferior coal, the mechanical factories promoting high-speed cutting, multi-tool cutting, and organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts, the steel industry's experience in increasing operating rates and shortening smelting time, the "labor division specialization" of the Electrical Engineering Plant No. 5, and the papermaking industry's rapid cooking and increased paper machine speed. If these advanced experiences (including advanced working methods and advanced technologies) are fully popularized in departments with similar business natures, and are mastered by the majority of workers, technicians and staff, that is to say, making them the dominant and prevailing working methods, then it will be possible to increase production and save a lot of wealth for the country, and greatly improve the level of various tasks.
    Let's take an example. Before learning from the Soviet advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts," a certain machinery factory produced less than one lathe per day on average; after organizing production according to this advanced experience, it produced two lathes per day in April this year, and it is estimated that it can produce three lathes per day in the third quarter. From last year to now, the factory's equipment and number of workers have not increased, and the types of lathes have not changed, but the output has increased and the product quality has also improved. Before November last year, the factory had no first-class products, and second-class products accounted for only 15 percent, with most being third-class products. In the first quarter of this year, first-class products rose to 40 percent, and most were second-class products. The labor productivity in the first quarter increased by an average of 27 percent compared with the second half of last year, while the cost decreased by 14 percent. Their main experiences are: the whole factory, each workshop, and each production team should make specific production operation plans, so that the parts produced by machine tools are roughly fixed, materials are batched, and the reserve quotas of parts are specified and maintained, so that the assembly workshop can achieve preliminary assembly line operations. In this way, they not only increased production, but also overcame the phenomenon of "relaxing at the beginning of the month and rushing to work overtime at the end of the month." These experiences can not only be fully promoted in the machinery and electrical industries, but its basic principles can be adopted in all industrial sectors.
    In the coal mining industry, if we conscientiously promote the experience of the Cui Guoshan rapid tunneling team, we can double the labor productivity of tunneling (the main production preparation work of coal mines), and we can also reverse the abnormal phenomenon that tunneling has been lagging behind output for a long time. In the power industry, if the rapid overhaul method is promoted, it is equivalent to adding 10,000 to 20,000 kilowatts of standby power to the high-voltage grid every year. If the experience of burning inferior coal is promoted, more than 300,000 tons of good coal can be saved in a year. Promoting the experience of producing and using mixed cement can increase the output of cement by 20 percent, reduce the cost by more than 10 percent, and improve the quality of certain projects. There are many similar examples.
    Some personnel in our industrial and mining enterprises have some incorrect views on popularizing advanced experience. They believe that "this is the responsibility of political workers, not our business," and regard the popularization of advanced experience as irrelevant to themselves, and therefore stand by and watch. Some people say, "As long as the experience itself is indeed advanced, it will naturally be popularized," which is a spontaneous theory of abandoning leadership. Some people, in their busy work, cannot see or grasp the main things, and they feel that "there are too many tricks of advanced experience, we can't learn them all, and there is no way to promote them!" This is a manifestation of bureaucratic work style. Some people also put the popularization of advanced experience in opposition to the completion of work tasks, and they say, "It is important to rush to complete the task, and we can't take care of these," which is a short-sighted view, indicating that there is blindness in their work. To transform the popularization of advanced experience into a mass movement, these incorrect views must be thoroughly criticized and corrected.
    There is no doubt that popularizing advanced experience should be one of the main leadership methods of cadres at all levels of enterprises. Advanced experience is created by the masses in practice, and popularizing advanced experience is to popularize it among the masses, which is to concretely implement Chairman Mao's leadership method of "concentrate, persevere." Therefore, whether advanced experience can be discovered and popularized in a timely manner has become one of the important signs to assess whether the leadership is in-depth and specific. Being good at discovering new things (advanced experience), and conscientiously and promptly studying, summarizing and popularizing them, is a concrete manifestation of the leadership cadres' mass viewpoint.
    Popularizing advanced experience is also one of the basic contents of political work in industrial and mining enterprises. Without ideological and political education of workers and staff and the popularization of advanced experience, factory political work will lose its direction, become weak and powerless, and will not be able to solve any problems. On the contrary, as long as factory political work grasps these two links and combines them with specific situations and links them with the current central tasks, it can generate tremendous power and become a strong guarantee for the successful completion of work tasks. This is true for industrial production, and it is also true for capital construction.
    The popularization of advanced experience should be carried out continuously, and it is not enough to just have a good start. That is to say, there must be leadership from beginning to end. It is very important to make a decision on popularizing an advanced experience, issue instructions, and convene a mobilization meeting, but this is only the beginning of the matter. If you don't care about it after issuing instructions and mobilizing, and let it go with the flow, it will become empty talk and will not help in practice. The popularization of any advanced experience will inevitably cause a series of changes in production or engineering. If these changes are not studied and resolved, the popularization work will be stagnant. For example, the implementation of high-speed cutting method will cause changes in tools, wage quotas, parts and parts production coordination, raw material supply, etc. Without unremitting leadership, it will not be possible to adapt various tasks to it, as a result, the promotion of high-speed cutting method will be delayed or aborted; the reason why the new coal mining method has not been further promoted is also here. Therefore, after a good start, there must be unremitting efforts. That is to say: the popularization of advanced experience should be and must be a mass movement with leadership from beginning to end and with the participation of the broad masses.
    In order to effectively popularize advanced experience, we must also oppose the conservative ideas that exist among some employees. People who hold this idea not only turn a blind eye to the buds of new things, but often refuse to accept or even refuse to recognize new things. In their way of thinking, they are unconsciously bound by mechanical materialism, and in their actual actions, they cannot get rid of certain outdated views or narrow experiences. They are often satisfied with the status quo and stick to the old ways. Without overcoming these conservative ideas, the various advanced experiences cannot be smoothly promoted.
    Under the new democratic regime, state-owned enterprises are socialist enterprises. The relationship between them is fundamentally different from that of capitalist enterprises. The working class has become the master of the enterprise. Under such conditions, not only can many advanced experiences emerge, but the popularization of advanced experiences also has broad development prospects. The Soviet Stakhanov movement was a movement to promote advanced production experience on a large scale, and the Kovalev working method was a working method that was good at integrating advanced experience. Comrade Kalinin said it well: "It is important to create a certain advanced experience, but it is more important to promote these experiences." Therefore, there is no need to doubt that the leading cadres at all levels of our industrial and mining enterprises should take the popularization of advanced experience as one of their main responsibilities. As long as we earnestly and practically promote advanced experience, we can push the campaign of increasing production and practicing thrift to a new climax.

### 推广先进经验是实现增产节约的基本方法

    推广先进经验是实现增产节约的基本方法
    东北国营工矿企业在三反运动胜利的基础上将展开新的增产节约运动。今年增产节约的任务较去年更为艰巨。完成这一艰巨任务的基本方法是切实认真地推广各项先进经验。
    经过三年的恢复和发展，东北工业已经出现了新的情况。在各类工业中都涌现了大量的先进生产者和先进经验。例如鸡西煤矿局的崔国山快速掘进队，抚顺发电厂快速检修法，鸡西发电厂燃烧劣煤的经验，机械工厂推行高速切削、多刀多刃切削及按指示图表组织有节奏的生产，钢铁工业提高作业率、缩短熔炼时间的经验，电工五厂的“劳动分工专业化”，造纸工业的快速蒸煮和提高抄速等。这些先进经验（包括先进工作法与先进技术）如在同类业务性质的部门全面推广，使之为大多数工人、技术人员和职员所掌握，也就是说使之成为主导的、占支配地位的工作方法，那末，就能为国家增产节约大量的财富，就能使各项工作的水平大大提高一步。
    我们举例来说吧。机械某厂在学习苏联先进经验
    “按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”以前，平均每天出产车床不到一台；按照这一先进经验组织生产以后，今年四月每天出产车床两台，到第三季度估计每天可出产三台。从去年到现在，该厂的设备和工人数量都没有增添，车床种类也没有改变，产量提高了，产品质量也提高了。该厂去年十一月以前没有一级品，二级品仅占百分之十五，大部分为三级品。今年第一季一级品上升到百分之四十，大部分为二级品。第一季劳动生产率较去年下半年平均提高百分之二十七，成本则降低百分之十四。他们的主要经验是：全厂、每个车间、每个生产小组都做好具体的生产作业计划，使机床生产的零件大致上固定起来，大批的下料，规定和保持部件的储备定额，使装配车间做到初步的流水作业。这样他们不但增加了生产，而且克服了“月初松一口气，月底加班突击”的现象。这些经验不仅可以在机械、电器工业中全面推广，它的基本原则，在所有工业部门中都是可以采用的。
    在煤矿工业中如果认真推广崔国山快速掘进队的经验，就可以使掘进（煤矿主要生产准备工作）的劳动生产率提高一倍，而且可以扭转长时期以来掘进落后于产量的畸形现象。在电力工业中如果推广了快速检修法，等于每年在高压网内增加了一万至两万瓩备用电源。燃烧劣煤的经验如得到推广，一年可以节省三十万吨以上的好煤。推广生产和使用混合水泥的经验，能够使水泥的产量增加百分之二十，成本降低百分之十以上，而且可以提高一定工程的质量。诸如此类的例子是很多的。
    我们工矿企业的某些人员，对推广先进经验存在着一些不正确的观点。他们认为：“这是政治工作人员的责任，不是我们的事情”，把推广先进经验看成和自己无关，因而袖手旁观。有人说：“只要经验本身的确是先进的，就自然而然会推广”，这是一种放弃领导的自发论。有的在纷繁的工作中，看不清更抓不住主要的东西，他们觉得“先进经验的名堂太多了，学不过来，没法推广！”这是事务主义思想作风的一种表现。也有人把推广先进经验与完成工作任务对立起来，他们说：“赶任务要紧，顾不上这些”，这是近视眼的看法，说明他们的工作中带有盲目性。要把推广先进经验形成为群众性的运动，必须彻底地批判和纠正这些不正确的观点。
    毫无疑问，推广先进经验应该是各级企业干部主要领导方法之一。先进经验是群众在实践中创造出来的，推广先进经验，就是要把它普及到群众中去，这就是具体地贯彻毛主席“集中起来，坚持下去”的领导方法。因此，先进经验能否及时发现与推广，就成为考核领导是否深入、具体的重要标志之一。善于发现新鲜事物（先进经验），认真而及时地加以研究、总结并推广，是领导干部的群众观点的具体表现。
    推广先进经验又是工矿企业政治工作的基本内容之一。离开对职工群众进行思想政治教育和推广先进经验，工厂政治工作就会迷失方向，就会软弱无力，也就不能解决任何问题。相反的，工厂政治工作只要抓住了这两个环节，并和具体情况相结合，和当前的中心任务联系起来，就能产生巨大的力量，成为胜利完成工作任务的坚强保证。对工业生产是这样，对基本建设也是这样。
    推广先进经验应该不间断地进行，仅仅有良好的开端是非常不够的。这就是说，自始至终必须要有领导。对推广一项先进经验作出决定，发布指示，召开动员会议是很重要的，但这只是事情的开端。如果发布指示进行动员之后就不闻不问，任其自流，就会形成空谈，于实际无补。任何一项先进经验普及起来，必然会引起生产中或工程中一系列的变化。对这些变化不加研究和解决，就会使推广工作停顿下来。例如实行高速切削法，就会引起工具、工资定额、部件和部件的生产配合、原材料供应等等发生变化，没有坚持不懈的领导，就不能使各项工作与之相适应，结果，便会使高速切削法的推广迟迟不前或趋于流产；新式采煤方法之所以没有进一步的推广起来，其原因也就在这里。因此，有了良好的开端以后，还必须有坚持不懈的努力。也就是说：推广先进经验应该是也必须是自始至终有领导的有广大群众参加的群众运动。
    为着有效地推广先进经验，还必须反对部分职工中存在着的保守思想。抱着这种思想的人们不但对新鲜事物的萌芽熟视无睹，而且常常拒绝接受，甚至拒绝承认新鲜事物。他们在思想方法上不自觉地受了机械唯物论的束缚，在实际行动上摆脱不了某些业已陈旧的观点或狭隘经验。他们常常满足现状，故步自封。不克服这些保守思想，就不能顺利地推广各项先进经验。
    在新民主主义政权下，国营企业是社会主义性质的企业。它们互相之间的关系和资本主义企业是根本不同的。工人阶级已成为企业的主人。在这样条件下，不但能够涌现许多先进经验，而且先进经验的推广也具有广阔的发展前途。苏联的斯塔哈诺夫运动就是大规模推广先进生产经验的运动，郭瓦廖夫工作方法就是善于综合先进经验的工作方法。加里宁同志说得好：“创造某一先进经验固然是重要的，但更重要的是推广这些经验。”因此，丝毫用不着怀疑，我们工矿企业的各级领导干部均应把推广先进经验作为自己的主要职责之一，只要认真、切实地推广先进经验，就可以把增产节约运动推向新的高潮。
