Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 18th. TASS dispatch: The American aggressors' massacre of prisoners of war on Koje Island has aroused angry protests from the Polish people. The "People's Tribune" wrote: The cruelty of the crimes committed by the American interventionists on Koje Island exceeds the atrocities of the Hitler bandits. The newspaper wrote: The United States has consistently attempted to sabotage the Panmunjom negotiations, making it impossible to establish peace in Korea, and has put forward shameful proposals in an attempt to forcibly detain more than 100,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the pretext of so-called "screening," turning them into slaves of American imperialism forever. Judging from these facts, the Koje Island incident clearly has special significance. The newspaper continued: The executioners who massacred prisoners of war on Koje Island are the very people who vainly attempt to realize their criminal plans by using bacteriological weapons, which are condemned by the world. Whether it is bacteriological warfare or the massacre in prisoner of war camps, both have aroused a wave of unanimous indignation around the world. All honest people resolutely demand an end to the interventionists' atrocities.

    抗议美国屠杀我被俘人员
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社华沙十八日讯：美国侵略者在巨济岛上屠杀战俘的事件，引起了波兰人民的愤怒抗议。“人民论坛报”写道：美国干涉者在巨济岛上的罪行的残酷程度，超过了希特勒匪徒的暴行。该报写道：美国一贯企图破坏板门店谈判，使朝鲜的和平无法建立，并提出了可耻的建议，企图藉口所谓“甄别”来强迫扣留十万以上的朝鲜和中国战俘，把他们永远变作美帝国主义的奴隶。从这些事实看来，巨济岛事件显然具有特别的意义。该报继称：屠杀巨济岛上战俘的刽子手们，就是那些妄想实现其罪恶计划而使用举世谴责的细菌武器的人们。不论是细菌战争，还是战俘营的屠杀，都激起了举世一致的愤怒浪潮。一切正直的人们都坚决要求制止干涉者的暴行。
