To our respected Premier Zhou:

On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we extend our highest respects to you.

Over the past five years, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have made great achievements in politics, economy, culture, education, and health in their efforts to realize Chairman Mao's great national policy. We have deeply realized that only by implementing national regional autonomy can the Inner Mongolian people achieve complete liberation. In the future, we will further strengthen various construction tasks to make the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region more developed and prosperous, further improve people's lives, and consolidate the great unity of all ethnic groups.

Currently, we are responding to Chairman Mao's great call, and on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, we are enthusiastically carrying out the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign throughout the region. At the same time, we will certainly continue to promote patriotism and internationalism, and contribute even greater strength to opposing the aggression of American imperialism, consolidating the great motherland, and defending world peace.

    内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五周年大会
    给周恩来总理的致敬电
    敬爱的周总理：
    值此内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五周年之际，我们向您致以崇高的敬礼。
    五年来，内蒙古各族人民在实现毛主席伟大的民族政策的努力中，在政治、经济、文教卫生各方面，都获得了很大成就。我们深深体验到只有实行民族区域自治，内蒙古民族才能获得彻底解放。今后我们将更进一步加强各项建设工作，使内蒙古自治区更加发展和繁荣，进一步改善人民生活，巩固各族人民的伟大团结。
    当前，我们正响应着毛主席的伟大号召，在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，在全区热烈开展爱国增产节约运动，同时，我们一定继续发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，为巩固伟大祖国与保卫世界和平贡献出更大的力量。
