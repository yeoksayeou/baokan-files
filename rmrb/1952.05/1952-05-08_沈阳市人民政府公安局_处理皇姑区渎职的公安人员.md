    Shenyang Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau
    Handles Dereliction of Duty by Public Security Personnel in Huanggu District
    Editor: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Yu Tang criticizing that public security personnel of the Huanggu District Public Security Bureau in Shenyang City lost their position and actually supported unscrupulous merchants, unreasonably detaining workers. This criticism is correct.

    With the approval of higher authorities, we arrested and prosecuted on March 8th, Jing Yuantong, the director of the Xuechi Police Station, who shielded unscrupulous merchants and illegally detained workers and trade union cadres; Wu Qingyun, the public security officer who colluded with unscrupulous merchants; and Fu Zhongxiu, the public security officer who violated the law. The unscrupulous merchant who beat workers, undermined the "Five-Anti" movement, and instigated public security personnel to violate the law was also arrested and prosecuted. Afterwards, our bureau ordered District Bureau Chief Zhu Guofan to personally apologize to the workers and the trade union; and on March 10th, a police officer meeting was held, where Deputy Bureau Chief Cui used this incident as an example to educate all police officers, calling on them to thoroughly transform their old thinking and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    The original reader's letter mentioned: "The arrested workers and trade union cadres were sent to Director Zhu of the District Public Security Bureau for strict handling," which is inconsistent with the actual situation. The police station contacted by telephone to send them to the branch bureau, but it was refused by Branch Bureau Chief Zhu at the time.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    沈阳市人民政府公安局
    处理皇姑区渎职的公安人员
    编辑同志：人民日报曾刊载读者虞唐的来信，批评沈阳市皇姑区公安分局公安人员失掉立场，竟替奸商撑腰，无理扣押工人。这个批评是正确的。
    经上级批准，我们已在三月八日把包庇奸商非法扣留工人和工会干部的雪耻派出所所长荆元通、勾结奸商的公安员吴庆云和违法的公安员傅忠秀，逮捕法办；把殴打工人、破坏“五反”运动、唆使公安人员违法的奸商也逮捕法办。事后，我局责令区分局长朱国藩亲自向工人、工会道歉；并在三月十日召开员警大会，由崔副局长拿这一事件为例，教育全体员警，号召他们彻底改造旧思想，全心全意为人民服务。
    原来的读者来信中曾提到：“把被捕的工人与工会干部送交区公安分局朱局长严办”，这与实际情况不合。派出所曾以电话联系拟送分局，但当时已为朱分局长拒绝。
