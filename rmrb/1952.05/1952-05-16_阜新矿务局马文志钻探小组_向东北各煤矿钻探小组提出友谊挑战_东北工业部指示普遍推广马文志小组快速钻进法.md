    Fuxin Mining Bureau Ma Wenzhi Drilling Team
    Issues Friendly Challenge to Drilling Teams of Northeast Coal Mines
    Northeast Industry Department Directs Widespread Promotion of Ma Wenzhi Team's Rapid Drilling Method
    In response to Chairman Mao's call to launch a production increase and economy drive, the Ma Wenzhi drilling team of the Northeast Fuxin Mining Bureau has issued a friendly challenge to drilling teams of all mines in the Northeast. The Ma Wenzhi team consists of twenty-two people (including six reserve personnel who are being trained). In this competition, they will improve operating methods, increase efficiency, and reduce costs while ensuring quality and safety. The specific conditions of the Ma Wenzhi team's challenge are: 1. From May 1st to the end of December, strive to complete four boreholes of 500 meters each, totaling 2,000 meters (drilling through rock layers, with conglomerate accounting for approximately one-fifth, sandstone approximately three-fifths, and sandy shale approximately one-fifth); and complete the training plan for reserve personnel. 2. In terms of quality, ensure accurate recording of rock and coal seams; strive to achieve a 100% core (including rock powder, coal core, and coal powder) recovery rate, without any impurities; measure water flow every hour, and accurately measure water consumption and time when changing layers. 3. In terms of safety: conscientiously abide by and implement operating procedures, strengthen the safety responsibility system (implementing a mechanical responsibility system), strictly implement handover and inspection systems, achieve safe operation, and ensure no accidents occur. 4. Reduce the cost per meter drilled by 10% to 15% compared to the cost in 1951. 5. Strengthen technical, political, and cultural learning, read the newspaper once a day, hold life review meetings twice a month; hold a meeting once a day to study and arrange work. Ensure that existing illiterate members of the team recognize 500 to 1,000 characters by the end of 1952.
    In order to promote the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi team, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Northeast People's Government Industry Department and the Northeast Regional Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union jointly issued instructions on April 24th. The instructions require all bureaus to conscientiously promote the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi drilling team, strengthen leadership over drilling work, pay attention to conducting political and ideological education, improve drilling work organizations and trade union organizations, organize drilling workers, technicians, and cadres to study the labor organization and technical experience of the Ma Wenzhi team, and generally improve drilling efficiency. The instructions also require leading cadres responsible for capital construction in each bureau to go deep into the construction sites and organize workers and technicians in each team to widely discuss the challenge conditions of the Ma Wenzhi team and formulate practical response plans. The instructions also require all mining bureaus and trade union organizations to vigorously cultivate advanced drilling teams, train drilling reserve personnel, and report monthly to the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau and the Northeast Regional Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union on the progress of promotion and competition.
    On May 1st, the Northeast People's Government Industry Department issued "Instructions on Promoting the Ma Wenzhi Rapid Drilling Method," instructing the Northeast Coal Mine Management Bureau to conscientiously implement the instructions issued on April 24th, and also instructing all geological survey and drilling units under the Northeast Industry Department to emulate the methods stipulated in the instructions of the Northeast Industry Department Coal Mine Administration Bureau and quickly promote the Ma Wenzhi team's rapid drilling method.

    阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组
    向东北各煤矿钻探小组提出友谊挑战
    东北工业部指示普遍推广马文志小组快速钻进法
    为了响应毛主席关于开展增产节约运动的号召，东北阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组向东北各矿的钻探小组提出了友谊的挑战。马文志小组共有二十二个人（包括培养训练后备人员六名）。在这次竞赛中，他们要在保证质量、保证安全的基础上，改进操作方法，提高效率，降低成本。马文志小组挑战的具体条件是：一、由五月一日开始到十二月末，争取完成五百公尺钻孔四个，共二千公尺（钻进岩层砾岩约占五分之一，砂岩约占五分之三，砂页岩约占五分之一）；并完成训练后备人员的计划。二、在质量方面，保证岩层煤层记录正确；岩芯（包括岩粉、煤芯、煤粉）采取率争取达到百分之百，并且不使含有杂质；水纹记录每小时量一次，换层时量准消耗水量和时间。三、在安全方面：切实遵守和贯彻操作规程，加强安全责任制
    （实行机械专责制），严格执行交接班和检查制度，达到安全作业，保证不出事故。四、每进一公尺的成本，较一九五一年的成本降低百分之十到十五。五、加强技术、政治、文化学习，每天读报一次，每月开两次生活检讨会；每天开一次碰头会，研究和布置工作。保证小组中现有的文盲到一九五二年末认识五百字到一千字。
    为了推广马文志小组的先进经验，东北人民政府工业部煤矿管理局和煤矿工会东北区委员会在四月二十四日联合发出指示。指示要求各局认真地推广马文志钻探小组的先进经验，加强对钻探工作的领导，注意进行政治思想教育，健全钻探工作机构和工会组织，组织钻探工人、技术人员和干部学习马文志小组的劳动组织和技术经验，普遍地提高钻探效率。指示中并要求各局负责基本建设的领导干部，深入工地，组织各小组工人和技术人员广泛地讨论马文志小组的挑战条件，订出切实可行的应战计划书。指示并要求各矿务局和工会组织大力培养先进的钻探小组，培养和训练钻探后备人员，同时按月向东北煤矿管理局和煤矿工会东北区委员会报告推广工作和竞赛进行的情况。
    五月一日，东北人民政府工业部发出“关于推广马文志快速钻进法的指示”，责成东北煤矿管理总局认真贯彻他们在四月二十四日发出的指示，同时责成东北工业部所属各地质勘察和钻探单位，仿效东北工业部煤矿管理局指示中所规定的办法，迅速推广马文志小组的快速钻进法。
