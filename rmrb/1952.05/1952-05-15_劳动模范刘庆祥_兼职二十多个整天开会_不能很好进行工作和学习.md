To the Editor: I am the vice-chairman of the trade union of Jinan Second Machine Factory. After being elected as the vice-chairman of the trade union in January 1951, I always thought about how to do good things for everyone; my work enthusiasm is very high. However, I hold more than twenty concurrent positions and am busy attending meetings all day long. In addition to attending more than thirty meetings in the factory every month, I also have to attend the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee, the Jinan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee, the Machinery Manufacturing Trade Union Executive Committee, etc. Attending meetings outside takes up seventeen days a month. I have to attend meetings for twenty-eight or nine days every month. Therefore, I cannot devote all my energy to trade union work, cannot often go deep into the front line, and cannot connect with the masses well. I have been troubled by this problem for a long time. Because of frequent meetings, I have to work until eleven or twelve o'clock at night every day, and I don't even have time to read the newspaper, let alone study culture. I hope the relevant departments will solve this problem.

    兼职二十多个整天开会 不能很好进行工作和学习
    编辑同志：我是济南第二机器厂的工会副主席。我在一九五一年一月当选工会副主席之后，总在想着怎样为大家办好事情；我的工作情绪很高。但是我兼任二十多个职务，整天忙于开会。我每月除在厂内开三十多次会外，又须出席山东省各界人民代表会议，山东省工会执行委员会、济南市工会执行委员会、机器制造业工会执行委员会等，每月在外面开会也需时十七天。我每月要开二十八九天的会。因此我不能以全部精力来做工会工作，不能经常深入现场，很好地联系群众。我长期为这个问题苦恼。因为常开会，我每天要忙到夜晚十一、二点钟，连看报纸的时间都没有，学文化就更谈不上了。我希望有关部门解决这个问题。
