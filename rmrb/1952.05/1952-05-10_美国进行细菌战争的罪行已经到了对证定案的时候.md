America's large-scale bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China will not only harm the people of Korea and China but also cause severe disasters to all of humanity. Even an elementary school student knows that bacteria do not distinguish between race and nationality. If, by artificial means, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, plague, and various other life-threatening germs are scattered in large quantities in the air on the ground, the victims will not be limited to residents in the war zone and the rear; it will create a pandemic worldwide, threatening the extinction of all mankind. Therefore, all people with a modicum of conscience deeply hate the crime of launching bacteriological warfare and regard the mastermind behind the use of bacteriological weapons—the American government—as the common enemy of mankind.

Only a very few people are exceptions. This very small number of people are completely devoid of humanity because they are kept, manipulated, and driven by Wall Street's monopoly capital. They quibble and deny the American aggressors, stubbornly claiming that bacteriological warfare is a fabrication by Koreans and Chinese, refusing to admit the facts before them. According to their logic, it is as if the sun rises in the west instead of the east. Three weeks ago, I encountered such a person at a press conference in Vienna. This kind of person is a lapdog of Wall Street. They are completely devoid of humanity, and they are as filthy as the lice, fleas, and flies containing poisonous bacteria scattered by American planes. Their only skill is lying and sophistry.

The most vicious people in the world are often the most foolish. The American aggressors are as ferocious as wolves and tigers, as cunning as foxes, and as stupid as pigs. They can keep, employ, and buy a group of journalists, radio broadcasters, and secret agents who know no shame, lying and spreading rumors all day long, deceiving the American people and the people of the world. They can use the so-called International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization as their tools for gathering intelligence and deceiving public opinion. They can also use their power to dismiss Professor Brandweiner of the University of Graz in Austria—the head of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team. The American aggressors think that this way, they can deceive the eyes and ears of the world, that all the world's public opinion can be manufactured and bought with American dollars, that all the people of the world can be deceived; the American aggressors can scatter poisonous insects and poisonous substances every day without letting the American people and the people of the world know that such a thing is happening.

Isn't this idea of the American government foolish? It is foolishly ridiculous. Needless to say, the eyes of the people are sharp, and it is impossible to deceive the eyes and ears of the world. Even the airmen and secret agents trained and employed by the American aggressors are not guaranteed not to expose their secrets. The Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea previously captured five American secret agents, all of whom confessed that the US military used bacteriological weapons and that they were ordered by the US military to investigate the actual effects of bacteriological warfare in northern Korea. Four of these agents were originally Korean, and one was Chinese. The American aggressors can still deny it. Now the confessions of American air force prisoners of war Inak and Quinn have been announced in the newspapers. These confessions were written in person by American air force personnel and broadcast personally by them. What other methods can the American aggressors use to quibble and deny?

There is a Chinese saying: "If you don't want people to know, don't do it." The crimes of American imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare have been completely exposed and can no longer be denied. As a legal worker, I believe that the heinous crime of the American bandits using bacteriological weapons, creating viral epidemics, and endangering human life has now reached the time for adjudication and condemnation. All people of goodwill in the world must stand up and make a final public judgment on the number one enemy of mankind—American imperialism. For the sake of human survival and the eternal moral concept, we must not allow the bacteriological war criminals to remain at large forever.

    美国进行细菌战争的罪行已经到了对证定案的时候
    沈钧儒
    美国帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行大规模的细菌战，其结果将不只是侵害朝鲜和中国人民，并且会使全世界人类遭受严重的灾殃。一个小学生都知道，细菌是不问人种和国籍的。要是用人为的方法，在地面的空气中，大量撒布伤寒、霍乱、痢疾、鼠疫以及其他各种足以伤害生命的病菌，受害者决不仅限于战地和后方居民，它将造成普遍全世界的疫疠，使全人类有灭亡的危险。所以凡是稍有良心的人们对于发动细菌战这一种罪行，没有一个不切齿痛恨，没有一个不把使用细菌武器的主谋者——美国政府——视为人类的公敌。
    只有极少数的人是属于例外。这种极少数的人，由于被华尔街独占资本所豢养，所操纵，所驱使，完全丧失了人性。他们替美国侵略者狡辩，抵赖，硬说细菌战是朝鲜人和中国人的造谣，对于摆在面前的事实死不承认。按照他们的逻辑，仿佛太阳是从西边出来，而不是从东边出来的。三星期以前，我在维也纳记者招待会上，就遇到了这样的一种人。这种人就是华尔街的哈叭狗。他们完全丧失了人性，他们肮脏得和美国飞机所撒布的含有毒菌的虱子、跳蚤、苍蝇一样，唯一的本领是撒谎和狡辩。
    世界上最凶恶的人往往也是最愚蠢的。美国侵略者像狼虎那样凶残，像狐狸那样狡猾，同时又像猪那样蠢笨。他可以豢养、雇用、收买一批不知人间有羞耻的新闻记者、无线电广播员和特务走狗们，一天到晚地在撒谎造谣，哄骗美国人民，哄骗全世界人民。他可以使用所谓红十字国际委员会和世界卫生组织，作为他的收集情报和蒙蔽舆论的御用机关。他也可以利用权势，开除奥地利格拉茨大学的一位教授——国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团长布兰德魏纳先生。美国侵略者以为这样就可以以一手掩尽天下人耳目，全世界的舆论都可以用美金制造和收买，全世界人民都是可以哄骗得过去的；美国侵略者可以天天撒布毒虫毒物，却不使美国人民和世界人民知道有这么一件事。
    美国政府的这种想法是不是愚蠢呢？是愚蠢得很可笑的。不用说人民的眼睛是雪亮的，要以一手掩尽天下人耳目是不可能的，就是美国侵略者自己所训练雇用的空军人员和特务，也绝不保险不揭露他们的黑幕。在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军，以前俘掳的五名美军特务，都曾经坦白供认了美军使用细菌武器，他们奉了美军命令到朝鲜北部调查细菌战的实际效果。这些特务原来有四个是朝鲜籍，一个是中国籍的，美国侵略者还可以抵赖。现在美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词已经在报上宣布了。这些供词是美国籍的空军人员亲笔书写的，又是由本人亲口广播的。美国侵略者又有什么方法来狡辩和抵赖？
    中国人有一句话：“若要人不知，除非己莫为。”美国帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行，已经完全暴露了，是再也抵赖不过去了。我以一个法律工作者的身份，认为美国强盗使用细菌武器，制造病毒疫疠，危害人类生命这一滔天罪行，现在已经到了对证定案的时候。全世界一切具有良善意志的人们，都要挺身而出，对于天字第一号的人类公敌——美国帝国主义——作最后的公判，为了人类的生存和永久的道德观念，决不能让细菌战犯永远逍遥法外。
