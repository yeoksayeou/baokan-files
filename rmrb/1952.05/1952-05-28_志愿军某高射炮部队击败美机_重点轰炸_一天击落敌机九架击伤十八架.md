    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 27th: An anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in a certain area of northern Korea engaged in fierce combat with 292 enemy aircraft sorties on May 8th, shooting down and damaging a total of 27 enemy planes. This is one of the brilliant examples of defeating the American aggressors' so-called "key bombing."
    The air defense operation lasted from morning until afternoon. The anti-aircraft gunners continuously struck the incoming air bandits in batches. Their slogan was: "We must build the blocking line in the sky and resolutely defeat the enemy's key bombing!" During the first battle in the morning, 36 enemy planes attacked. One of them, while pulling up after a dive-bombing run, was hit by anti-aircraft fire and caught fire. Several others were also hit by artillery shells. In the second battle, an enemy plane was hit head-on by a shell while diving and crashed to the ground. The most intense fighting occurred at noon, with enemy planes flying in batches to bomb and strafe the area. On the shrapnel-swept position, the anti-aircraft gunners intercepted the diving enemy planes head-on with artillery shells and machine gun fire, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in a short period of time. First gunner Yue Jianhua was knocked unconscious by earth thrown up by a bomb blast. When he regained consciousness, he immediately climbed back onto the gun mount and continued firing, instantly shooting down an enemy plane. Some enemy planes were hit simultaneously by anti-aircraft fire from various locations and were shattered in the sky. In the afternoon, the severely battered enemy planes returned in two more batches, dropping bombs indiscriminately from an altitude of 3,000 meters, but another one was hit by our anti-aircraft fire. On this day, the heroic anti-aircraft gunners and anti-aircraft machine gunners fought fiercely with 292 enemy aircraft sorties for thirteen hours, shooting down nine and damaging eighteen, inflicting a serious defeat on the enemy's "key bombing" of the area.

    志愿军某高射炮部队击败美机“重点轰炸”
    一天击落敌机九架击伤十八架
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十七日电】朝鲜北部某地的中国人民志愿军的一个高射炮部队，五月八日先后与二百九十二架次敌机猛烈战斗，共击落击伤敌机二十七架。这是击败美国侵略者所谓“重点轰炸”的光辉战例之一。
    这天对空作战从早晨一直进行到下午，对空射击手们连续不停地打击着分批来袭的空中强盗，他们的口号是：“我们要把阻击战线筑上天空，坚决打败敌机的重点轰炸！”在上午第一次的战斗中，来袭的敌机有三十六架，其中一架进行俯冲轰炸以后正在向上飞升时，就被高射炮弹击中起火，另外有几架也被炮弹击中。在第二次的战斗中，有一架敌机在俯冲时被炮弹迎头击中，一直坠落到地上。最激烈的战斗是在中午，敌机一批又一批地飞到该地上空进行轰炸、扫射。在弹片飞啸的阵地上，对空射击手们用炮弹和机关枪弹迎面截击俯冲下来的敌机，使敌机在短时间内遭到惨重的损失。第一炮炮手岳建华被炸弹炸起的土块打昏了，醒来时马上爬上炮座继续射击，瞬间就击落了一架敌机。有的敌机同时被各处射上去的高射炮火所击中，在天空中炸得粉碎。下午，受了严重打击的敌机又来两批，它们在三千公尺的高空乱投炸弹，但又被我高射炮火打中了一架。这一天，英勇的高射炮手和高射机关枪手们先后与二百九十二架次敌机激战十三小时，击落九架，击伤十八架，使敌机对该地的“重点轰炸”受到严重的失败。
