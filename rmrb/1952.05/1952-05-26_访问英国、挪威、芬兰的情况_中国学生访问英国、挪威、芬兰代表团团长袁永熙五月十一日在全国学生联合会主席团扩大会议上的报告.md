President, Vice-Presidents, Esteemed Executive Committee Members:

At the invitation of the student unions of Britain, Norway, and Finland, and the Finland-China Friendship Association, the All-China Students' Federation dispatched us—the Student Delegation of the People's Republic of China—to visit the students of Britain, Norway, and Finland.

We arrived in London on January 24th and stayed in Britain for four weeks, visiting universities in sixteen cities and touring their campuses and facilities. We saw the places where the renowned British scientist Newton and the great poet Byron had worked in the past, and we also saw the contributions of the British people to science and culture. We met some professors and social figures who are working hard for world peace and friendship with China. After concluding our visit to Britain, we went to Norway and visited Oslo, the capital of Norway, for five days. We also stayed in Finland for eight days, visiting universities in Helsinki and Turku, the capital of Finland, and participated in many gatherings of workers and youth organized by the Finland-China Friendship Association; we expressed our respect to the Finnish working class on behalf of the Chinese students.

The delegation consisted of six members, including representatives of the All-China Students' Federation, representatives of the All-China Students' Federation to the International Union of Students, representatives of Renmin University of China, representatives of Peking University, representatives of the Shanghai Students' Federation, and interpreters. The task of this delegation was to introduce the great achievements of the new China's construction and the happy lives of the new China's students, and at the same time, to understand the learning and living conditions of students in these countries, in order to enhance understanding and friendship between Chinese students and students in Britain, Norway, and Finland, and to work together to defend world peace!

We held friendly meetings with British students. In mass rallies, weekend parties, and casual chats over tea, we came into contact with many upright students. From the conversations of these ordinary college students, we heard the genuine voice of the British people—their ardent desire for peace and their friendly attitude towards new China. Although this voice is obscured by American-style war cries and the distorted and malicious propaganda of bourgeois newspapers, we cherish it very much. We know that it is expanding day by day. Many British students are extremely interested in the construction achievements of new China and the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea. They loved the Chinese records, pictures, and various artworks we brought with us. Several universities launched signature campaigns to welcome us; some students ran to the station to see us off. We know that this expresses not only friendship for our six representatives, but also friendship for the students of new China and respect for the new China that has stood up.

In Britain, we met many students from colonial countries. They warmly cared about new China and eagerly wanted to know about China's construction, land reform, the war to resist America and aid Korea, and the student movement. They cherished the badges of Mao Zedong's image that we gave them. They knew that the Chinese revolutionary struggle was their example, and the direction pointed out by Mao Zedong was their direction. We also met our students studying abroad and overseas Chinese students. They warmly welcomed us. They listened carefully to reports on the domestic situation and watched the films we brought. Everyone was excited about the victory and strength of the motherland. Many students studying abroad hope to return to the country quickly to serve the people.

When we visited the ancient and famous universities, and when we saw some upright professors and students working hard on academic research for the happiness of mankind, we also deeply felt the disasters that imperialist war propaganda and huge military budgets brought to the British people and students. Even now, many things are still subject to rationing. As military spending increases, funding for culture and education is decreasing. Only a small portion of middle school students have the opportunity to go to university. In universities, the number of scholarships is limited, and many students have to work part-time to avoid dropping out of school, and do odd jobs in factories or farms during the holidays. Many British universities have stopped adding and repairing school buildings due to financial difficulties. We saw that many school construction plans have now been replaced by plans to expand armaments. When some British students heard us talk about how Chinese students before liberation faced “graduation is unemployment,” they smiled painfully. In the face of the economic crisis, it is difficult for them to find jobs, and it is even more difficult for female students to find jobs than male students. Therefore, when we said that the construction of the new China is developing rapidly and that all departments need a large number of specialized talents, some of them asked, "Is it possible to go to China to find work?"

British students are gradually realizing from their own practical experience what following the American policy of aggression will bring them. They still vividly remember the painful experience of the last war. Everywhere in Britain, one can see the broken walls and tiles left by the bombing. The auditorium of the University of Bristol, which was bombed during the war, has not been completely repaired, but now the cries of war and frantic arms preparations are pressing upon them again. How can they not be bewildered? In many conversations with us, they revealed their dissatisfaction with the fact that savage American soldiers are still stationed on their territory in peacetime. They saw that the American imperialists were arbitrarily restricting their country's free trade with the East, making the lives of the British people more difficult. They realized that recognizing new China and allowing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to remain in the United Nations was an absurd contradiction, and that the American military occupation of Taiwan was a serious threat to peace. Therefore, suspicion and dissatisfaction with the United States are growing among them. Mrs. Felton, who won the Stalin International Peace Prize, was almost beaten when she pointed out American aggression in Korea at Cambridge University a year ago. Today, she told us that students at Cambridge University can now calmly listen to her report on the truth about the Korean issue and are beginning to doubt American false propaganda. These gradual changes in views are reflected in the growing British student movement for peace. For example, students at Cardiff University wrote on the signature book welcoming us: "Let the voice of peace drown out everything! The British people do not want to fight the great Chinese people!" More students are calling for increased understanding and friendship between the people of all countries to jointly eliminate the threat of war. Students at the London School of Economics proposed to the British National Union of Students: as this war crisis threatens them, they want to understand the situation of students in the Soviet Union, China, and other countries, and request inviting student delegations from the Soviet Union and China to visit them.

Of course, many of these demands for increased international understanding are sincere, but carrying out this work is not easy and will encounter all kinds of obstacles and sabotage. American and British bourgeois newspapers and radio stations, which spread a large number of lies every day, constantly slander and vilify our China wantonly. Affected by these distorted propaganda, many British students asked us questions such as: "Why did you invade Tibet?" and "Why did you parade foreign priests and nuns in the streets?" We answered all kinds of questions they raised patiently. However, a newspaper in Birmingham published a piece of news with the headline: "The Iron Curtain Falls in the Face of Questions," and attached a photo of several members of the delegation with their hands on their chins, secretly taken to prove that the Chinese student delegation was unwilling to answer questions. Although we focused on introducing the great achievements of new China's economic and cultural construction, few newspapers published it. These newspapers are afraid of the British people and students understanding the true situation of new China.

In various gatherings and talks, we patiently exchanged different opinions and answered various questions with British students. We believe that every meeting can increase mutual understanding, and we value these meetings very much, because sincere friendship comes from sincere understanding. There were also some universities and student groups that invited us, but due to difficulties in scheduling, we were unable to meet with them. We fully understand the goodwill of these organizations. But indeed, some British student "leaders" tried their best to isolate us from British students, such as using invitations to restrict students from participating in gatherings, or scheduling meetings at the same time as students' classes and sports competitions, but their practices sometimes ended in shameful failure. The president of the Cardiff University Student Union did not tell his classmates about our arrival and sent the delegation to stay in a seaside resort far from the school, but afterwards the students of the school learned of this fact and held a meeting to reprimand the president of the student union.

In Britain, the facts we saw show that if we want to increase the understanding and friendship between the Chinese and British people and young students, we need to work together with the upright people and young students in Britain to dispel the smog of vicious distortion propaganda and wage a serious struggle against activities that undermine international cooperation. We believe that the struggle of the people and young students of the world to unite and strive for peace, friendship, and progress will surely win more and greater victories! (Xinhua News Agency)

    访问英国、挪威、芬兰的情况
    ——中国学生访问英国、挪威、芬兰代表团团长袁永熙五月十一日在全国学生联合会主席团扩大会议上的报告主席、副主席、各位执委：
    中华全国学生联合会接受英国、挪威、芬兰三国的学生联合会及芬中友好协会的邀请派遣我们——中华人民共和国学生代表团去访问英、挪、芬三国学生。
    我们于一月二十四日抵达伦敦、在英国逗留了四个星期，访问了十六个城市的大学，参观了这些大学的校舍和设备。我们看到英国著名科学家牛顿和大诗人拜伦过去工作过的地方，也看到英国人民在科学文化方面的贡献。我们见到了一些教授及社会人士，他们在为世界和平及对中国友好努力工作着。我们在结束了访问英国之后，又去挪威，在挪威首都奥斯陆访问了五天。我们又在芬兰逗留了八天，访问芬兰首都赫尔辛基和土尔库两城市的大学，参加了不少次芬中友协所组织的工人和青年的集会；我们代表中国学生向芬兰的工人阶级表示了敬意。
    代表团是由中华全国学生联合会代表、中华全国学联驻国际学联代表、中国人民大学代表、北京大学代表、上海学联代表及翻译等六人组成的。这个代表团的任务是介绍新中国建设的伟大成就和新中国学生幸福的生活，同时了解这些国家学生学习和生活的情况，以便增进中国学生和英、挪、芬三国学生之间的了解和友谊，共同为保卫世界和平而努力！
    我们与英国学生作了友谊的会见。在群众集会上、在周末晚会上、在喝茶漫谈中，我们接触到许多正直的学生。从这些普通大学生的谈话中，我们听到英国人民真正的声音——他们对和平的热烈的愿望和对新中国友好的态度。虽然这声音被美国式的战争叫嚣，被资产阶级报纸对中国歪曲恶意的宣传所掩蔽了，可是我们十分珍重它。我们知道它正在一天一天地扩大起来。英国的许多学生对新中国建设成就和抗美援朝的胜利感到极大的兴趣。对我们带去的中国唱片，画片和各种艺术品，他们十分喜爱。有好几个大学发起签名欢迎我们；有些学生跑到车站欢送我们。我们知道，这不仅表示对我们六个代表的友谊，而是表示了对新中国学生的友谊，对站立起来了的新中国的敬意。
    在英国我们会见了许多殖民地国家的学生，他们热烈地关怀着新中国，迫切地希望知道中国建设事业、中国土地改革、抗美援朝及学生运动的情况。他们十分珍爱我们送给他们的毛泽东像的徽章。他们知道中国革命斗争是他们的榜样，毛泽东所指出的方向是他们的方向。我们也会见了我国留学生和华侨学生。他们热烈地欢迎我们。他们注意地听取关于国内情况的报告，看了我们带去的电影，大家都为祖国的胜利和强大而兴奋。很多留学生希望迅速回国为人民服务。
    当我们参观古老而著名的大学的时候，当我们看到一些正直的教授和学生们为了人类幸福而努力研究学术的时候，我们也深深感到帝国主义战争宣传和庞大备战预算带给了英国人民和学生的灾难。直到现在，许多东西还保留着配给制。随着军费的增加，文教经费在降低。中学生只有一小部分有机会升入大学。在大学里奖学金名额是有限的，不少学生为了不致辍学要半工半读，假期里要到工厂或农场去做零工。英国许多大学因为经费困难已停止添修校舍。我们看到许多学校的建设计划，现在都被扩充军备计划所代替了。当一些英国学生听我们谈到解放前中国学生“毕业就是失业”的时候，他们露出痛苦的微笑。在经济危机面前，他们找职业是困难的，女学生找职业比男学生更为困难。因此，当我们说到在新中国的建设事业迅速发展，各个部门都需要大批专门人才的时候，他们之中有的人就探问道：“可不可以到中国去找工作？”
    英国的学生渐渐从自己的实际体验中，逐渐认识追随美国侵略政策带给他们的将是什么。上次大战中惨痛的经历他们记忆犹新。英国到处可见轰炸遗下的断墙零瓦。布利斯托尔大学在大战中被炸塌的礼堂，还未完全修复，但是现在战争的叫嚣与疯狂的备战行动，却又迫人而来，这能使他们不惶惑吗？在和我们多次谈话中，他们对在和平时期野蛮的美国兵还驻扎在他们国土上这一事实，透露出不满。他们看到美帝国主义者横蛮地限制他们国家和东方进行自由贸易，使英国人民的生活更加困难。他们发觉承认新中国与让蒋介石匪帮代表留在联合国是一个荒谬的矛盾，而美国军队侵占台湾，正是对和平严重的威胁。因此，在他们之间对美国的怀疑和不满正在滋长。荣获斯大林国际和平奖金的费尔顿夫人，在一年以前，在剑桥大学指出美国在朝鲜的侵略时，几乎还挨打的，今天她告诉我们，剑桥大学学生已经能够平静地听她报告朝鲜问题的真相，并且开始怀疑美国的虚假宣传。这些看法的逐渐改变，反映在英国学生争取和平的运动的日渐发展，像加狄夫大学学生在欢迎我们的签名书上写道：“让和平的声音压倒一切！英国人民不要和伟大的中国人民作战！”更多的学生要求增进各国人民的了解和友谊，来共同消灭战争的威胁。伦敦经济学院的学生向英国学联提出：在这个战争危机威胁着他们时，他们要了解苏联、中国等国家学生的情况，要求邀请苏联、中国的学生代表团去访问他们。
    诚然，这些增进国际了解的要求许多是有诚意的，但是进行这项工作并不是轻易的，是会遭到各种各样的阻挠与破坏的。每日每时在散布大量谎言的美英资产阶级报纸和电台，不断对我们中国恣意地诽谤和污蔑。受了这些歪曲宣传的影响，许多英国学生向我们提出了：“你们为什么侵略西藏？”、
    “你们为什么要外籍教士和修女游街？”之类的问题。我们对于他们提出的各种各样的问题，都一一耐心地予以解答。可是伯明罕的一家报纸，却登出了这样的消息，标题是：“铁幕在问题面前落下来了”，在消息前还特意附上一张偷偷地拍下的代表团几个团员托腮的照片，来证明中国学生代表团不愿解答问题。虽然我们着重介绍新中国经济和文教建设的伟大成就，可是很少报纸登载。这些报纸是害怕英国人民和学生了解新中国真实情况的。
    在各次集会和谈话中，我们和英国学生耐心地交换了不同的意见，回答了各种问题。我们相信每次会晤都能增加相互的了解，我们非常重视这些会晤，因为真诚的友谊是会从真诚的了解上得来的。还有一些大学和学生团体曾邀请我们，由于节目安排的困难，所以未能与他们会见。我们对这些组织的善意是十分领会的。但的确也有些英国学生“领袖”们想尽办法把我们和英国学生隔离开，譬如用发请帖来限制学生参加集会，或把会议时间安排在学生上课和运动比赛节目的同时，但是他们的做法有时也遭到可耻的失败。加狄夫大学学生会主席不把我们到达的消息告诉同学，把代表团送到离校很远的海滨住下，但事后该校的学生知道了这一事实，开会斥责了这个学生会主席。
    在英国，我们看到的事实说明：要增进中英两国人民和青年学生的了解和友谊，还需要我们和英国正直的人民和青年学生们共同努力，拨开恶毒的歪曲宣传的烟雾，对破坏国际合作的活动，进行严肃的斗争。我们相信，世界人民和青年学生团结一致争取和平、友好和进步的斗争，一定能获得更多更大的胜利！（新华社）
