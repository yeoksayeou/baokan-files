    Gogol's Love and Hatred
    Sun Wei Shi
    We are using this performance of "The Government Inspector" to commemorate the great Russian writer Gogol and to welcome our dear international friends who defend world peace.
    The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, love Gogol because we too have suffered the hardships the Russian people suffered. We understand Gogol's laughter; he never coldly treated the things around him. He keenly observed, painfully exposed, and profoundly mocked, and this laughter carries so many bitter tears, so much love for Russia! As Nekrasov wrote in his poem to Gogol:
    Harboring hatred in his chest,
    A sarcastic smile on his lips;
    He walked the thorny path,
    Carrying a harp to punish sinners. ……………………
    Slander attacked him from all sides,
    Only when they saw his corpse,
    Did they understand how much he had done!
    How he hated in love.
    In his two immortal works, "Dead Souls" and "The Government Inspector," Gogol mercilessly exposed the corrupt Tsarist rule and the sinful serf system. He had great faith in the Russian people in chains. Through the heroes Taras Bulba, he said:
    "Parents love their children, and children love their parents; this is not the love we seek, because beasts also love their children, but only humans understand the love that is not based on blood but on spiritual union!"
    Gogol exclaimed: "Can such fire, pain, and power be found in the world that can conquer the power of Russia!" What great confidence he had in the power of the Russian people!
    He was familiar with folk customs, habits, and language. He diligently collected folk tales. From "The Eve of Ivan Kupala," "Sorochintsy Fair," and "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka," we see the beautiful and alluring Ukrainian scenery and rich folk life. He hated the unreasonable serf system, hated the Tsar's barbaric and corrupt rule, and loved his motherland and people.
    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, in 1935, Chinese artists staged "The Government Inspector," using Gogol's biting satire to mercilessly expose the corrupt rule of the reactionary regime; this play was later performed continuously and played a certain role. Our performance of "The Government Inspector" today has even more positive political significance.
    The "Pravda" review said: "...Gogol mercilessly exposed all the dark forces in the world. Today, as we carry out the great construction in our country, Gogol is still with us, helping us to sweep away the obstacles on the road to building communism." Whether in the Soviet Union or in China, the era of reactionary rule is gone forever. Under the brilliant light of Stalin, the Soviet people are happily building a communist society; 500 million oppressed Chinese people have been liberated, and Chairman Mao is leading us from victory to victory. Unfolding before our beloved motherland is a future of infinite happiness. But in this world, there still exists a small handful of imperialist elements who have turned beautiful Korea into a battlefield of rubble, causing mothers and wives to lose their sons and husbands. In order to achieve their aims of aggression, the American imperialists are carrying out bacteriological warfare, their cruelty and shamelessness far exceeding Tsar Nicholas. However, their delusions will never be realized. The progressive people of the world are closely united around the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the aggressors are bound to perish! The collapse of German fascism should teach them a deserved lesson. "The Government Inspector" is Gogol's judgment of the dark forces. Today, we perform "The Government Inspector," and the judges are we—the liberated children of New China. Let us use Gogol's laughter to mercilessly expose the remaining dark forces in the world!

    果戈理的爱和憎
    孙维世
    我们用这次“钦差大臣”的演出来纪念俄国伟大的作家果戈理，来欢迎保卫世界和平的亲爱的国际友人。
    中国人民和苏联人民一样热爱果戈理，因为我们也曾经遭受俄罗斯人民所受过的苦难，我们懂得果戈理的笑，他决不冷漠地对待周围事物。他敏锐地观察，痛心地揭露和深刻地嘲笑，这笑声带着多少辛酸的眼泪，带着多少对俄罗斯的热爱！正如涅克拉索夫写给果戈理的诗上所说的一样：
    胸中怀着仇恨，
    唇边带着讽刺的笑痕；
    他走过荆棘的途径，
    带着惩治罪人的竖琴。……………………
    诽谤从各方向他进攻，
    只在看到他尸体的时候，
    才懂得他作了多少事情！
    他是怎样在爱中仇恨。
    果戈理在他两部不朽的作品“死魂灵”和“钦差大臣”中对腐朽的沙皇统治、罪恶的农奴制度作了无情的揭露，他对在锁练下的俄罗斯人民却满怀信心，他通过英雄达拉士、布尔巴说了这样的话：
    “父母爱自己的孩子，孩子也爱自己的父母；这还不是我们所要的爱，因为野兽也爱自己的孩子，但是只有人类才懂得非血缘的而是由于精神结合的爱！”
    果戈理发出了这样的呼喊：“难道在世界上可以找得到能征服俄罗斯力量的这种火焰、痛苦和力量吗！”他对俄罗斯人民的力量是怀着多么大的信心啊！
    他熟悉民间的风俗、习惯、语言，他曾用心地收集了民间故事，从“复活节的前夜”“梭洛琴集市”“在达堪加乡村的傍晚”，我们看到美丽诱人的乌克兰景色和丰富的民间生活，他仇恨不合理的农奴制度，仇恨沙皇野蛮腐朽的统治，热爱自己的祖国和人民。
    在国民党反动统治时代，在一九三五年，中国的艺术工作者上演了“钦差大臣”，就用了果戈理的辛辣讽刺无情地揭露了反动政权的腐朽统治；以后这戏又曾不断地演出，都起了一定的作用；我们今天来上演“钦差大臣”更有它积极的政治意义。
    “真理报”的评论上说：“……果戈理向世界上的一切黑暗势力作了无情的揭露，在我们祖国进行伟大建设的今天，果戈理仍和我们在一起帮助我们扫除建设共产主义道路上的障碍。”无论在苏联或在中国，反动统治的时代已经是一去不返了。苏联人民在斯大林的光辉照耀之下，幸福地建设着共产主义社会；五万万受压迫的中国人民获得解放，毛主席领导我们从胜利走向胜利，展开在我们可爱的祖国前面的是无限幸福的远景。但是在这个世界上，还存在着一小撮帝国主义分子，它使美丽的朝鲜变成瓦砾的战场。使母亲和妻子们失去儿子和丈夫。为了要达到侵略的目的，美帝国主义者正在进行细菌战争，他们的残忍无耻远超过沙皇尼古拉。然而他们的妄想永远也不会实现，世界进步人类紧紧地团结在以苏联为首的和平阵营周围，侵略者必然死亡！德国法西斯的崩溃，应该使他们得到应得的教训。“钦差大臣”是果戈理对黑暗势力的审判，今天我们来演出“钦差大臣”，这审判者就是我们——被解放了的新中国的儿女们，让我们用果戈理的笑向世界上残存的黑暗势力作无情的揭露吧！
