Avicenna devoted his life to promoting the progress of medicine in his country and in the world, influencing medical advancement in Europe and Asia for no less than seven hundred years. He made great efforts to strengthen cultural ties between various nations.

Medieval Europe was in a very dark age in terms of culture and science. All the classics and medical literature were controlled by monks and priests. The clergy engaged in healing as a sideline, running from door to door of the sick all day long. Doctors at this time only learned some simple medical skills and did not engage in any research. They did not inquire about basic knowledge such as anatomy, physiology, and pathology. The so-called famous doctors were merely reciting some drug names.

At this time, the Islamic Empire was established, encouraging science, especially paying attention to chemistry and medicine. They not only boldly absorbed Greek medicine, but also had brilliant achievements in this area, far surpassing Europe at that time. They established a number of universities, of which the University of Baghdad was the most famous, with 6,000 teachers and students at one time.

The tenth century was a brilliant period of Arab culture. Libraries, schools and hospitals were established one after another. Education was also quite developed, and many physicians were trained, most of whom were Persian. Persians were proficient in science, but because Arabic was the common language of Islamic intellectuals at that time, they used Arabic instead of their native language to write. The most famous physician at this time was Avicenna. He not only promoted Arab medicine, but also had a significant influence on the development of European medicine.

Avicenna left us with many great works, as many as ninety-nine. Among them, sixty-eight belong to theology and philosophy, eleven belong to science and astronomy, sixteen belong to medicine, and four are collections of poems. His poems were very beautiful, and eight medical books were written in poetry. His philosophy belongs to the Aristotelian school, and the method used is Aristotle's dialectics. Later generations called him Aristotle II. In medicine, he followed Galen as a model, striving to create a strict system for medicine, and strongly advocated that medicine is a consistent, regular, and logical science. He believed that curing diseases is like a law in mathematics.

His most famous medical work is the "Canon of Medicine." This book summarizes all contemporary medical knowledge, organizes and annotates it, surpassing the medical works of those before him and those of his contemporaries. This book is divided into five volumes, each volume is divided into several chapters, totaling about one million words. The first volume is a general discussion; the second volume is on materia medica; the third volume describes diseases and treatments according to body parts (from head to toe); the fourth volume is on systemic diseases, that is, diseases that occur in various parts of the body at the same time, such as febrile diseases; the fifth volume is on prescriptions. However, there are some discrepancies between the above introduction and the actual content. For example, the first volume is divided into four chapters, the first chapter is the definition of medicine, the second chapter is the classification of diseases and general causes and symptoms, the third chapter discusses methods of maintaining health, and the fourth chapter is on general treatment methods. Each chapter is further divided into sections. For example, in addition to recording epidemics such as smallpox and measles, the fourth volume also records surgical fractures and dislocations in Chapter 5.

This book directly absorbs the theories of the Greek physician Galen, and also draws on the medicine of China and India, communicating the medical knowledge of various nations in Europe and Asia. His medical theory is based on the basic principles of cosmology and psychology to explain the problems of life, disease and death. As for the methods of treatment, it combines health preservation methods, drugs and surgery. Many of the theories and treatments in the "Canon of Medicine" are still in use today. For example, emotions and physiological states; the choice of housing and drinking water, the relationship between climate and disease and health; hydrotherapy, diet therapy, urethral instillation, vaginal packing, oral anesthesia, animal testing of drug efficacy, and using malaria to treat mental illness, etc. It first recorded the contagiousness of pulmonary tuberculosis and the sweet taste of urine in diabetic patients, etc.

In terms of drugs, it records as many as 670 kinds. It first recorded the alchemists' distillation method and alcohol manufacturing method, which is of great value to the progress of pharmaceutical chemistry. It also recorded three kinds of mineral acids, rose water, arsenic, corrosive sublimate, etc.

In diagnosis, he attached great importance to pulse taking, urine testing, and stool examination. The distinction of pulse is extremely fine, as many as forty-eight kinds. The Chinese pulse classic probably had been transmitted to Arabia at this time. Avicenna may have seen this kind of book, so thirty-five of the forty-eight kinds of pulses are consistent with those recorded in the pulse classic. Secondly, he also attached great importance to urine testing. For example, the appearance, color, and precipitation of urine were all carefully distinguished. Many of the diagnostic criteria in the book are consistent with modern medicine.

Avicenna was a person who was keen on observation and good at description. He not only summarized the records of previous physicians, but also used logical methods to find out the common and unchanging laws of things. He used this law to deduce the health and disease of life. Then, he divided patients into categories and became a complete system. This method is easy to learn and easy to implement, reducing the suffering of beginners in medicine who groped in the dark. It is the most practical method. The main reason why this book is so popular and long-lasting is that it is practical, and the second reason is that it is profound.

This book was completed during the decline of European medicine. In the twelfth century, Spaniards translated it into Latin, and at the same time, Jews annotated it. Therefore, this book quickly became popular in Europe and Asia, and doctors regarded it as a classic. European medical schools also used this book as a textbook. When examining medical students, they routinely found some questions from his book for students to answer.

For example, the University of Leipzig in Germany was established in 1409. The medical curriculum in the first and second semesters taught Avicenna's Canon of Medicine, the works of Galen in the third and fourth semesters, and Hippocrates's aphorisms in the fifth and sixth semesters. This kind of curriculum did not change for more than one hundred years.

After the invention of printing in Europe in the fifteenth century, the Latin translation of Avicenna's work was printed in 1476. Later, because of its wide popularity, it was published more than thirty times, and it was even printed once in Cairo in recent years. The original text of his work was first printed in Rome in 1493. There is also a Hebrew translation, which is now stored in the Pulonna Library. Later, this Canon of Medicine was annotated by many Europeans, which is a grand sight. Therefore, in 1523, an Italian compiled it into a special book and printed it.

In 1270, our China established the Guanghui Department in Beijing, which was in charge of repairing and managing the imperial Huihui medicines and concoctions for the treatment of the guards and the poor in Beijing at that time. In 1292, the Huihui Medicine Hospital was set up in Dadu (Beijing) and Shangdu (Duolun), and Muslims Yelikewen people (i.e. Christians) and Han people were hired to jointly manage medicine. At this time, Arabic medicine was in its heyday. Whether Arabs or Europeans used Avicenna's medical books as textbooks (as explained above). It can be seen that his works were likely translated into Chinese at this time. The Ming manuscript Huihui Materia Medica, which is now stored in the Beijing Library, is incomplete, and only the lower volume has a catalog. The order of the catalog of the lower volume is similar to that of his Canon of Medicine. It can be seen that his Canon of Medicine may have influenced Chinese medicine.

From the eleventh century to the seventeenth century, his work influenced the medical circles of Europe and Asia. Although the German Paracelsus burned this Canon of Medicine in front of the public at the University of Basel in the sixteenth century, denouncing it as useless. But he aroused the anger of people in the medical circle, and was finally expelled in 1528. It can be seen that in the sixteenth century, he was still respected by the medical circle. Until 1650, the universities of Montpellier and Rouen still used his book as a textbook.

In short, his contribution to medicine is not in the clinical experience of one branch and one section, but in establishing a system for medicine; he is even better at applying logic to medicine, so that people who study medicine can follow the books he wrote. From the eleventh century onwards, this medical beacon has illuminated for six or seven hundred years, facilitating the learning of doctors; relieving the suffering of countless patients, and further influencing the progress of world civilization. Undoubtedly, he has occupied an indelible position in the cultural connection between various nations. Today, a thousand years after his death, the reactionary doctors and scientists in the United States have forgotten the truth of healing the sick and saving lives, but instead manufacture bacteria to poison the Chinese and Korean people. It is indeed the most shameful and despicable behavior in the world. We hate those war criminals who use science and technology to poison peaceful residents, and at the same time we respect this great medical scientist Avicenna who benefited mankind.

    阿维森纳的医典和他在世界医学上的影响
    李涛
    阿维森纳平生从事促进本国医学和世界医学进步的工作，影响欧亚两洲医学进步前后不下七百年，他在加强各民族间文化联系方面曾尽了很大的力量。
    中世纪的欧洲在文化上、科学上都是处在极黑暗的时代。一切经典和医学文献都由僧侣牧师掌管。僧侣以治病为副业，终日奔走于病家之门。这时的医生只是学习一些简单的医术，谈不到什么研究，他们不过问解剖生理、病理等基础知识。所谓名医亦不过背诵若干药名而已。
    这时回教帝国成立，奖励科学，对于化学和医学尤其注意，他们不但大胆地吸收希腊医学，而且在这一方面有辉煌的业绩，远超过当时的欧洲。他们曾建立若干大学校，其中以巴格达的大学最为有名，一时曾有六千名教师和学生。
    第十世纪是阿拉伯文化灿烂的时期，图书馆、学校和医院相继设立。教育也相当发达，曾训练出很多医师，其中多半为波斯人。波斯人精于科学，但因阿拉伯文是当时回教知识分子的共同语文，所以不用本国文而用阿拉伯文著述。这时最有名的医师便是阿维森纳氏。他不仅促进阿拉伯医学，而且对于欧洲医学的发展有显著的影响。
    阿维森纳氏曾给我们留下许多的伟大著作，竟达九十九种之多。其中属于神学和哲学者有六十八种，属于科学和天文学者十一种，属于医学者十六种，诗集四种。他的诗写得非常美丽，有八种医书是用诗写的。他的哲学属于亚里斯多德派，所用的方法为亚里斯多德的辩证法，后世称他为亚里斯多德第二。在医学方面以该楞氏为法，努力为医学创立一严密系统，极力主张医学是有一致性、有规律、合乎逻辑的科学。认为治病，也似数学中的定律。
    他的医学著作中最有名的是“医典”。这部书总结了所有当代的医学知识，加以整理和注释，超过他以前和他同时代的人的医学著作。这部书共分为五卷，每卷内又分若干章，共约一百万字。第一卷总论；第二卷本草；第三卷按身体部位（从头到脚）叙述疾病和治疗；第四卷全身病，就是全身各部同时发病，如发热性病；第五卷配方。但是以上这种介绍和实际仍有若干出入，例如第一卷分四章，第一章为医学定义，第二章疾病的分类和一般原因和症状，第三章论保持健康的方法，第四章为一般治法。每章又分若干节。又如第四卷除了记述天花、麻疹等流行病外，其中第五章则记载外科的骨折和脱臼等。
    这部书直接吸取希腊医学家该楞氏的学说，兼采中国和印度的医学，沟通了欧亚两洲各民族医学的知识。他的医学学说是根据宇宙学、心理学的基本原则，以解释人生、疾病和死亡的问题。至于治病方法则兼取养生法、药物和手术。“医典”内的学说和治法，直到现在仍然有多处被沿用着。例如情感和生理状态；住房和饮水的选择，气候对于疾病和健康的关系；水疗法、饮食疗法、尿道注药法、阴道填塞法、口服麻药法、动物试验药力法、用疟疾治疗精神病法等等。它首先记载肺结核的传染性、糖尿病患者的尿有甜味等。
    在药物方面，他记载了六百七十种之多，首先记载炼丹家的蒸馏法、酒精制造法、对于药化学进步上有很大价值。它又记载了三种矿酸、蔷薇水、砒素、升汞等。
    他在诊断方面很重视切脉、验尿和检粪。脉搏的区别极其精细，多到四十八种。中国的脉经大约这时已传到阿拉伯，阿维森纳或已见到这类书，所以四十八种脉中有三十五种和脉经所记的相合。其次他对于验尿也很重视，例如尿的外观、颜色、沉淀等等都详加鉴别。书中诊断标准有很多地方和现代医学相合。
    阿氏是一位敏于观察、善于描写的人，不但综合了以前医家的记载，而且用逻辑方法找出事物共同不易的规律。用此规律推论人生的健康和疾病。于是将病人分成类别，成为一完好的系统。这种方法，易学易行，使初学医的人减少了暗中摸索的苦恼，是最实用的方法。他这部书所以流行广大而且年久，主要原因是实用，其次是渊博。
    这部书完成于欧洲医学衰落时期，十二世纪西班牙人将它译成拉丁文，同时犹太人更将它加以注释，所以这部书很快地流行欧亚两洲，医家都把它奉为经典。欧洲的医学校也用这部书作教本，在考试医学生时，照例地从他的书中找一些问题，让学生答复。
    例如德国莱比锡大学于一四零九年成立，在第一和第二学期的医学课程教阿维森纳的医典，第三和第四学期教该楞氏的著作，第五和第六学期教希波克拉底斯的箴言，这种课程表经过一百多年都没有变动。
    十五世纪欧洲印刷术发明以后，阿维森纳的这部著作的拉丁文译本在一四七六年便印行起来，以后因为流行的广泛，前后曾刊行三十版以上，就是近年还在开罗印过一次。他的这部著作的原文在一四九三年首先在罗马刊印。又有希伯来文的译本，现存普隆纳图书馆内。后来这部医典曾经多数欧洲人注释，洋洋大观，所以在一五二三年意大利人曾将它辑成专书印行。
    我们中国在一二七零年在北京设立了广惠司，掌修制御用回回药物及和剂，用以治疗当时的卫士和在京贫寒者。在一二九二年更在大都（北京）及上都（多伦）设置回回药物院，聘请回民也里可温人（即基督徒）和汉人共掌医药。这时阿拉伯医学正当兴盛时代，无论阿拉伯人或欧洲人都用阿维森纳氏的医书作为教本（已在上面说明），可见这时他的著作颇有译为中文的可能。北京图书馆现存的明抄本回回药方，残缺不全，目录也仅有下卷。按照下卷的目录的次序，和他的医典相似。可见他的医典或已影响到中国的医学。
    他这部著作由十一世纪起到十七世纪，一直影响着欧亚两洲的医学界。虽然十六世纪德国人巴拉塞尔萨斯氏曾在巴尔大学，当大众面前焚毁这部医典，斥为无用。但是他引起了医界人士的愤怒，终于一五二八年被逐出走。可见在十六世纪，他仍然是被医界尊敬的。直到一六五零年，蒙培利挨和罗文大学仍用他的书作教本。
    总之，他在医学上的贡献不在一枝一节的临床经验，而是将医学创立系统；更善于应用逻辑到医学中去，使学医的人读了他所著的书，便有所遵循。从十一世纪起，这位医界的明灯照耀了六七百年，便利了医生的学习；解除了无数病人的疾苦，更影响了世界文明的进步。无疑的，他在各民族间的文化联系上已占了永不磨灭的地位。在他死后千年的今日，美国的反动医生和科学家们，忘了治病救人的真理，反而制造细菌来毒害中朝人民，诚然是人间最可耻最卑鄙的行为。我们痛恨那些利用科学技术毒害和平居民的战争罪犯，同时更使我们尊敬这位造福人类的伟大医学家阿维森纳。（附图片）
