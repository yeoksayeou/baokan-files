Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 17th. After the American POW camp负责人负责人负责人in charge, Colson, confessed to the world the criminal facts of the American side's cruel persecution and forced screening of our captured personnel, the American aggressors not only showed no intention of remorse, but became enraged and overturned all their promises, and conspired to intensify their shameless persecution of our captured personnel.

The so-called Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, Clark, issued a shameless statement on the 15th, in accordance with the orders of the US Department of the Army, announcing that Colson's promise to our captured personnel, which he himself had announced in a statement three days earlier, "had no effect whatsoever." This means that the American aggressors have nakedly shown themselves to be perfidious in front of the whole world. Even more serious is that Clark's statement further proves that the US side is deliberately violating the Geneva Convention and carrying out extremely barbaric persecution of our captured personnel. Because what Clark is now overturning are the promises to give our captured personnel humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law, to ensure that no more violent actions and bloodshed occur, and to no longer carry out forced screening or any rearmament actions. Clark stated that these promises "have no effect whatsoever," which proves that the American aggressors will continue to treat our captured personnel with inhumane treatment that violates international conventions, continue to carry out bloody massacres and forced screening of our captured personnel, and continue to send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to serve as cannon fodder. Clark's statement, like the statement he issued on the 12th when he announced the demands of our captured personnel and the reply from Colson, the person in charge of the US POW camp, is ironclad evidence of the American aggressors' violation of the Geneva Convention and persecution of our captured personnel.

In fact, the news revealed by the American and British news agencies completely proves that the American aggressors are now plotting to carry out larger-scale massacres and persecutions of our captured personnel. After our captured personnel detained Dodd in order to demand that the US side stop inhumane persecution and forced screening, the then Commander-in-Chief of the American invading forces, Ridgway, instructed the Eighth Army to "take any necessary action and use any necessary force" (Associated Press, Seoul, 9th). The commander of the US Eighth Army, Van Fleet, personally went to Geoje Island several times to make arrangements. A large number of American tanks and "a well-trained, battle-hardened infantry" were sent to the island to deal with our unarmed captured personnel, and flame-throwing tanks were deployed in front of the No. 76 POW camp and "tested the burning flames several times" (United Press, Seoul, 11th). According to International News Service reporter Charlesberg, the island was heavily guarded, as if facing a formidable enemy. After our captured personnel released Dodd, the US side immediately broke its promise and threatened to carry out more brutal persecution of our captured personnel and continue forced screening. According to Reuters, Busan, 14th: "News from the island said that control has obviously become stricter, and there are few signs of relaxation in the military measures taken to rescue Dodd." According to Associated Press, Geoje Island, 15th, the new American POW camp负责人负责人负责人in charge, Bonner, blatantly believed that the American side's past persecution of our captured personnel was not brutal enough. Bonner believed that "the past treatment of enemy prisoners of war was too lenient," so he wanted to implement a "tough policy." This nakedly exposes the American aggressors' conspiracy to further carry out bloody massacres of our captured personnel who are justly resisting the US side's inhumane treatment. Associated Press, Geoje Island, 13th, also said that if our captured personnel are unwilling to endure the persecution of the US side, "the United Nations forces may use any necessary force." According to Associated Press, Geoje Island, 15th, the American authorities on Geoje Island have announced that "the weapons of the Geoje Island security forces have been increased to include tanks and flamethrowers. The army has been on alert since Dodd was detained eight days ago. In addition, other necessary steps have been taken." International News Service, Geoje Island, 16th, also said: "New barbed wire is being installed in front of the camp. New machine gun bunkers and other bunkers are also under construction." The American aggressors also plan to send more Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang special agents to the POW camps to serve as accomplices in further persecuting our captured personnel. The aforementioned International News Service news revealed that one of Bonner's methods "is to transfer more interpreters to this tense island." Along with all these sinister arrangements, the American aggressors are shamelessly continuing to carry out criminal forced screening of our captured personnel. An internal telegram from the Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th, revealed that the agency's "most reliable information" is that there are currently about 10,000 people still being "screened."

This conspiracy of the American aggressors to further massacre and persecute our captured personnel deserves the serious attention of people around the world.

### 美国侵略者在罪行被揭穿后恼羞成怒  竟阴谋进一步迫害我被俘人员  美国这一卑鄙阴谋值得引起全世界人民严重注意

    美国侵略者在罪行被揭穿后恼羞成怒
    竟阴谋进一步迫害我被俘人员
    美国这一卑鄙阴谋值得引起全世界人民严重注意
    【新华社开城十七日电】在美方战俘营负责人柯尔生向全世界招供了美方对我方被俘人员实行残酷迫害和强迫甄别的罪恶事实以后，美国侵略者不但毫无悔祸之意，反而恼羞成怒，将自己所作的诺言全部推翻，并阴谋变本加厉地对我方被俘人员进行更无耻的迫害。
    所谓联合国军总司令克拉克，在十五日依照美国陆军部的命令发表了一个无耻的声明，宣布三天以前他自己所发表的声明中所公布的柯尔生给我方被俘人员的诺言“没有丝毫效力”。这就是说，美国侵略者已赤裸裸地在全世界面前表明自己是这种背信弃义之徒。而意义更严重的是：克拉克的这一声明，更进一步地证明美方蓄意违反日内瓦公约，对我方被俘人员进行极端野蛮的迫害。因为克拉克现在所推翻的是给我方被俘人员以符合国际法原则的人道待遇、保证不再发生暴力行动和流血事件、不再进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动等诺言。克拉克声明这些诺言“没有丝毫效力”，这就证明美国侵略者还要继续用违反国际公约的非人道的待遇来对待我方被俘人员，还要继续对我方被俘人员进行血腥屠杀和强迫甄别，还要继续把他们送给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。克拉克这一声明，和他在十二日公布我方被俘人员的要求及美方俘虏营负责人柯尔生的复信时所发表的声明一样，是美国侵略者违反日内瓦公约、迫害我方被俘人员的铁的罪证。
    事实上，由美英通讯社所透露出来的消息，完全证明美国侵略者现在正在阴谋对我方被俘人员进行更大规模的屠杀与迫害。在我方被俘人员为了要求美方停止非人道的迫害和强迫甄别而扣留了杜德以后，当时的美国侵略军总司令李奇微就训令第八军“采取任何必要的行动并使用任何必要的武力”
    （美联社汉城九日电）。美国第八军军长范佛里特并亲自几次到巨济岛去进行布置。大批美军坦克和“一支精干的、久经战斗考验的步兵”开到岛上去对付手无寸铁的我方被俘人员，布置在七十六号俘虏营场前面的喷射火焰的坦克并且“曾几次试放了灼热的火焰”（合众社汉城十一日电）。据国际新闻社记者查尔伯格报道说，岛上戒备森严，如临大敌。在我方被俘人员释放了杜德以后，美方就立刻背弃诺言，扬言要对我方被俘人员进行更残暴的迫害，并继续进行强迫甄别。据路透社釜山十四日电称：“从该岛来的消息说：管制显然已经更加严紧，为了营救杜德而采取的军事措施很少有松弛的现象”。据美联社巨济岛十五日电透露，新任美方俘虏营负责人波纳公然认为美方过去对我方被俘人员的迫害还不够残暴，波纳认为“过去对待敌军俘虏失之过宽”，因此他要实行“强硬政策”。这赤裸裸地暴露了美国侵略者准备进一步对正义地反抗美方非人道待遇的我方被俘人员进行血腥屠杀的阴谋。美联社巨济岛十三日电也说，如果我方被俘人员不愿忍受美方的迫害，“联合国军方面就可能使用任何必要的武力”。据美联社巨济岛十五日电透露，巨济岛美方当局已经宣布，“巨济岛治安部队的武器已增加坦克和火焰喷射器两种。自八天前杜德被扣以来，军队即实行戒备。此外，还采取了其他必要步骤”。国际新闻社巨济岛十六日电也说：“营场前面正在安装新的铁丝网。新的机枪碉堡和其他碉堡也正在建筑中。”美国侵略者并计划加派国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务到俘虏营中去，以为进一步迫害我方被俘人员的鹰犬。上述国际新闻社的消息透露，波纳的办法之一“就是调更多的通译员到这个局势紧张的岛上来”。与所有这些阴险的布置同时，美国侵略者正在无耻地继续对我方被俘人员进行罪恶的强迫甄别。美联社东京十四日的内部电报透露：该社“所得到的最可靠的消息”是：目前还有一万人左右在被“甄别”。
    美国侵略者这种进一步屠杀和迫害我方被俘人员的阴谋，是值得引起全世界人民的严重注意的。
