Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 29th: The 23rd was the anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." The Tibetan local government held a celebration rally. People of all ethnic groups, Tibetan, Han, and Hui, in Lhasa enthusiastically participated in the celebration.

On May 23rd, the early summer sun shone on Lhasa. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa and the Tibetan local troops marched in neat rows, singing songs such as "The East is Red" and "March of the People's Liberation Army," and entered the venue one after another. Tibetan monks and laypeople carried red banners with the words "Support the Agreement" written in Tibetan and Chinese characters. They entered the venue along with the Han and Hui people.

The assembly hall was set up on the square in front of the Potala Palace. In the center of the rostrum hung the five-star national flag and a huge portrait of Chairman Mao. Around the venue were dozens of red flags and large character boards written in both Tibetan and Chinese with the seventeen articles of the agreement. The entire venue looked very solemn and beautiful.

The conference began with the joint performance of "The East is Red" by the Dalai Lama's guard of the Tibetan local army and the cultural troupe of the Tibet Military Region. The chairman of the conference, Rampa Tuden Gunqing (Chief Kalon of the Tibetan local government), reported on the significance of the meeting. He said: Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" was signed on this day last year in our motherland's capital, Beijing. This is a great victory for the Tibetan people and all fraternal ethnic groups in the country. Today, we solemnly commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the agreement. I hope everyone will unite closely and strive for the complete realization of the agreement.

General Zhang Jingwu, the representative of the Central People's Government, pointed out in his speech that the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" has been praised and supported by the vast number of monks and laypeople in Tibet over the past year. Patriotism among the Tibetan people has grown rapidly, and significant achievements have been made in the implementation of the agreement. These achievements are reflected in the Tibetan local government, headed by the Dalai Lama, supporting the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, supporting the agreement, and resolutely advocating the unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities, leading the Tibetan people to actively support the People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet; reflected in the Central People's Government's support for the development of Tibetan agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce; and reflected in the Panchen Erdeni's glorious return to Tibet and internal unity within Tibet. He said: The achievement of these accomplishments are the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government and the implementation of the great ethnic policies; the result of the close unity of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni and their leadership of the Tibetan people in supporting and implementing the agreement; and the result of the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet, their unity and love for the Tibetan people, and their faithful implementation of the agreement. Finally, he called on the monks and laypeople of Tibet and all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet to further unite, consolidate and develop the significant achievements made in the implementation of the agreement over the past year, and thoroughly implement the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" in a planned and step-by-step manner.

General Zhang Guohua, Commander of the Tibet Military Region, then spoke at the meeting. After briefly reporting on the achievements of the Tibet Military Region and all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet in consolidating national defense, maintaining local security in Tibet, and in production and transportation over the past year, he firmly stated that the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet will always adhere to the border of the motherland, consolidate national defense, continue to vigorously carry out production and construction, further unite closely with the Tibetan people, and strive to ensure the thorough realization of the peace agreement and to build a new Tibet.

Sukang Wangqing Kalon, representative of the Tibetan local government, and Ji Jinmei Zhaza, representative of the Panchen Kampus, unanimously stated in their speeches that the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" has brought light and happiness to the Tibetan people, enabling the Tibetan people to get rid of imperialist enslavement, return to the big family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups of the motherland, and enabling the agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce of Tibet to develop. They expressed that they will strive to fully realize the peace agreement in the future.

Apei A Wang Jinmei, who once served as the chief representative of the Tibetan local government's negotiation delegation, emphasized in his speech that the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" is completely in line with the interests of the Tibetan people. He said: The signing of the peace agreement is inseparable from the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the correctness of the ethnic policies of the Central People's Government. When we Tibetan people return to the big family of the motherland and enjoy the benefits of national equality, we must sincerely thank Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups of our country, and use practical actions to seek the full realization of the peace agreement.

Ma Junliang, the imam representative of the Hui ethnic group, congratulated the Tibetan people on their victory in returning to the big family of the motherland for the past year in his speech, and expressed his determination to strengthen unity and realize the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet."

The conference then proceeded with the presentation of Hada and flowers to General Zhang Jingwu and Zhang Guohua, representatives of the Central People's Government's negotiation team, and to the Tibetan local government's negotiation delegation headed by Apei, by Rampa Tuden Gunqing, Chief Kalon, representative of the Tibetan local government, Lhamin Yexi Chuchen, Secretary-General, representative of the Panchen Kampus, and representatives of the Tibet Military Region, respectively, to express their gratitude.
