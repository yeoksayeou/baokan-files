"Five-Anti" Briefs

	▲The third phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai has concluded victoriously. The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy convened a cadre meeting on the 5th to summarize the third phase and announce the start of the fourth phase. The third phase was the climax of the entire movement. This phase began on April 21st and, over the course of fifteen days, resolved the issues of more than 6,000 large industrial and commercial households and handled the issues of more than 70,000 small and medium industrial and commercial households. Together with the more than 2,000 large households and more than 20,000 small and medium households whose issues were resolved in the first and second phases, a total of 110,000 industrial and commercial households have been resolved in the three phases, accounting for more than two-thirds of the city's 160,000 industrial and commercial households. In terms of the number of employees, the employees of these 110,000 industrial and commercial households account for 70 percent of the total number of employees in private factories and shops in the city. Therefore, with the end of the third phase, the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai has achieved a basic victory.
	The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai has now entered its final stage. In this phase, in addition to continuing to resolve the illegal issues of 50,000 industrial and commercial households, the focus will be on handling the large households whose issues have already been resolved in the previous three phases. The fourth phase is an important stage for fully implementing policies, and everyone is now fully focused on starting work, striving for a complete and comprehensive victory of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai.
	▲In the second phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou, the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee has handled 30,000 industrial and commercial households of the law-abiding, basically law-abiding, and semi-law-abiding and semi-law-breaking categories, exceeding the planned target by 50 percent. This has rapidly formed a broad united front for the "Five-Anti" in Guangzhou. The rapid and thorough progress of the second phase was mainly due to: first, the full mobilization of workers and shop assistants. Statistics show that more than 90,000 workers and shop assistants directly participated in the struggle, of which more than 70,000 received ideological awareness raising through grievances and training, and tens of thousands of activists emerged from among them.
	In the second phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Guangzhou, on the one hand, a victory was achieved in the "Five-Anti" struggle, and on the other hand, good results were also achieved on the production front. The total value of orders entrusted to private factories for processing in April was three times that of the same period last year. State-owned specialized companies allocated large amounts of funds to purchase inventory from import and export industries. Banks began offering 100 billion yuan in loans to support private enterprises. Workers at Guangzhou Textile Factory No. 2, the largest private factory in Guangzhou, successfully implemented the Hao Jianxiu work method in the "Five-Anti" struggle. The polishing, packaging, and wire-tying departments of Xinghua Battery Factory, the largest private battery factory in Guangzhou, all created new production records. Factories in the rice and grain processing industry have increased production.

    “五反”简讯
    ▲上海市“五反”运动第三期工作已胜利结束，市增产节约委员会在五日召开“五反”工作干部大会总结第三期工作，并宣布第四期工作开始。第三期是整个运动的高潮。这期工作在四月二十一日开始，经过十五天的时间，已解决了六千多户大工商户的问题，处理了七万多户中小工商户的问题。连同第一、二两期已经解决问题的两千多户大户、二万多户中小工商户在内，三期共已解决了十一万工商户的问题，已占全市十六万工商户的三分之二以上；如以职工人数计算，这十一万工商户的职工占全市私营厂店职工总数的百分之七十。因此，随着第三期的结束，上海市“五反”运动已取得了基本的胜利。
    上海市的“五反”运动现在已进入了运动的最后阶段。这一期除继续解决五万户工商户的违法问题外，将着重对前三期已经解决问题的大户进行处理。第四期的工作是完整贯彻政策的重要阶段，现在大家已全力贯注地开始了工作，为争取上海“五反”运动彻底地全面地胜利而奋斗。
    ▲广州市“五反”运动第二期中，市“五反”运动委员会已处理了三万家守法、基本守法和半守法半违法三类工商户，超过预定计划百分之五十。这样就使广州“五反”的广泛的统一战线迅速形成。第二期工作进行得迅速和彻底，主要原因是：首先充分发动了工人、店员。统计直接参加斗争的工人、店员有九万多人，其中有七万多人经过诉苦和训练，提高了思想觉悟，在他们中间涌现出成千成万的积极分子。
    广州市“五反”运动第二期，一方面取得了“五反”斗争的胜利，另一方面在生产战线上也取得了良好的成绩。四月份委托私营工厂加工定货的总额，为去年同期的三倍。国营专业公司拨出了大批款项收购进出口行业的存货。银行开始举办一千亿元贷款，扶助私营企业。广州最大的私营广州纺二厂的工人，在“五反”斗争中成功地推行了郝建秀工作法。广州最大的私营兴华电池厂的磨光、包装、扎线等部，都创造了生产新纪录。米粮加工业的各工厂都提高了产量。
