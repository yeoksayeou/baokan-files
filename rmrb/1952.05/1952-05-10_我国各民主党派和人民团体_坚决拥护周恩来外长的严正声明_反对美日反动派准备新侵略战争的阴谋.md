    Our Country's Democratic Parties and People's Organizations
    Resolutely Support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's Solemn Statement
    Opposing the Conspiracy of the US-Japan Reactionaries to Prepare for a New War of Aggression
    [Report from this newspaper] The democratic parties and people's organizations of our country have unanimously expressed their firm support for the statement issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government on May 5 regarding the US announcement of the entry into force of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, and firmly oppose the conspiracy of US imperialism to prepare to launch a new war of aggression in the Far East.
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The US government's blatant and shameless announcement that the separate peace treaty with Japan, concocted single-handedly by it, has come into effect, its declaration of the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission in Washington and the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo, and its instruction to the Japanese Yoshida puppet government to sign an illegal "peace treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek remnants on Taiwan are ironclad proof that US imperialism is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, enslaving the Japanese people, antagonizing China and the Soviet Union, threatening the security of the Asian people, and preparing for a new war of aggression. Peace-loving people all over the world, especially the people of Asia, must fully recognize this serious fact and act in unison to resolutely counter this new provocative act by US imperialism. All comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang are determined to join the people of the whole country in responding to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's call with practical actions, and to prepare to inflict the most severe blow on the aggressors who vainly attempt to invade our sacred territory and undermine peace in Asia.
    The spokesman of the headquarters of the China Democratic League said: The China Democratic League has long expressed its determination to strive for the conclusion of a just and reasonable peace treaty with Japan that is conducive to peace in the Far East and enables Japan to become an independent, free, democratic, and peaceful country. But today, the US government, disregarding the protests and opposition of the Chinese and Japanese people, has illegally announced the entry into force of the separate peace treaty with Japan, attempting to revive Japanese militarism and re-invade China and Asia. This is absolutely intolerable to all the people of China. As for the so-called "peace treaty" signed by the reactionary Japanese Yoshida government with the Kuomintang remnants on Taiwan under the direction of the US government, it is an insult and provocation to the Chinese people, and we must resolutely oppose it. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and strive to smash any new war adventure schemes of US imperialism and its running dogs.
    The spokesman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said: The US imperialism's announcement of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan coming into effect and a series of other shameful acts further expose its crimes of brazenly betraying international faith, creating wars of aggression, and enslaving the people of other countries, which have reached a point of utter madness. This is a blatant new provocative act by US imperialism to expand the war in the Far East. The Chinese people will never allow these evil attempts to succeed!
    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: The US imperialists' brazen announcement of the entry into force of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan and other crimes have not only aroused the unparalleled anger of the Chinese people, but also the unparalleled anger of the people of Japan, Asia, and the world. Just three days after the US government announced the entry into force of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan—on May 1st, Labor Day—three million Japanese working people launched unprecedented and heroic demonstrations in more than 480 locations across the country. This is another demonstration by the Japanese people of their unwavering determination to oppose the separate peace treaty, oppose rearmament, oppose American aggression, oppose war, and defend peace. The Chinese people must unite with the Japanese people and all peace-loving people around the world to fight to the end to smash the new war conspiracy of US imperialism!
    The statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party stated: This series of illegal and provocative acts by the American aggressors, which violate international agreements and adhere to a policy of aggression and war preparations, will undoubtedly, like their base and shameless bacteriological warfare in violation of international law, not intimidate the great Chinese people. The Chinese people's strong will to oppose American aggression and defend peace in the Far East and the world is once again concentratedly expressed in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement. In addition to firmly expressing its support for this statement, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party calls on all its members to unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party, to stop the American conspiracy to create war in the Far East, and to never rest until this goal is achieved!
    The statement of the China Zhi Gong Party stated: The crimes of the American aggressors in announcing the entry into force of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan are not only a blatant threat and insult to the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries, but also a great insult to the Japanese people. Therefore, it has aroused the utmost anger of all peace-loving people. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and absolutely deny the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan and the Japanese-Chiang "peace treaty" announced by US imperialism as taking effect.
    The spokesman of the September 3rd Society said: All members of our Society resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and are willing, under the government's solemn call, to unite closely with cultural, educational, scientific workers, and the people of the whole country to thoroughly smash the conspiracy of the United States to prepare for a new war of aggression in the Far East, and to defend the security of the motherland and the peace of Asia and the world.
    Lin Yun, Acting Director of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Office in Beijing, said: The statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on May 5 represents the strong will and determination of the Chinese people to oppose the crimes of US imperialism. We fully support it. We, the people of Taiwan, see very clearly that the Kuomintang remnants who are cowering in Taiwan will not be able to prolong their dying fate because of the US imperialists' "aid" and the signing of the so-called "peace treaty". Under the leadership of the wise Chairman Mao Zedong, the entire Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, not only have the determination but also the strength to liberate Taiwan.
    The statement of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation stated: We represent the women of all China in warmly supporting the statement of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. The women of all China absolutely do not recognize and resolutely oppose the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan announced by the US government as taking effect. The purpose of the US government's series of conspiratorial activities, including the brazen announcement of the entry into force of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, is obviously to turn Japan into the center and bridgehead of its Far Eastern military aggression network in order to prepare for a new Far Eastern war of aggression to encircle New China and the Soviet Union. We vividly remember the profound disasters that wars of aggression bring to women and children. We must resolutely stop this arrogant war-preparing conspiracy of the American aggressors together with the people of the whole country.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a statement saying: Regarding this series of serious and blatant provocative acts by US imperialism, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a statement on May 5, denouncing them sharply and calling on the people of the whole country and the people of all Asia to unite and stop the crisis of US imperialism creating war in the Far East. The youth and students of the whole country fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and are determined to respond to US imperialism with practical actions.
    The statement of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: We represent the literary and art workers of the whole country in expressing our firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. In addition to expressing our resolute opposition to the illegal actions and arrogant conspiracies of US imperialism, Chinese literary and art workers pledge to fight resolutely with the people of the whole country to defeat all aggressive plans of the American reactionaries and their running dogs.

    我国各民主党派和人民团体
    坚决拥护周恩来外长的严正声明
    反对美日反动派准备新侵略战争的阴谋
    【本报讯】我国各民主党派、各人民团体，一致表示坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长在五月五日发表的关于美国宣布非法的单独对日和约生效的声明，坚决反对美帝国主义准备发动远东新侵略战争的阴谋。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：美国政府蛮横无耻地宣布它一手包办的单独对日和约生效，宣告解散在华盛顿的远东委员会和在东京的盟国对日委员会，并指使日本吉田傀儡政府与台湾蒋介石残匪签订所谓“和平条约”的非法行动，是美帝国主义加紧复活日本军国主义，奴役日本人民，敌视中苏两国，威胁亚洲人民安全，准备新的侵略战争的铁证。全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲人民，必须充分认识这一严重事实，一致行动起来坚决反击美帝国主义这种新的挑衅行为。中国国民党革命委员会的全体同志决心和全国人民一道，以实际行动响应周恩来外长的号召，准备给妄想侵犯我神圣国土、破坏亚洲和平的侵略者以最严重的打击。
    中国民主同盟总部发言人说：中国民主同盟早已表示要为缔结一个公正合理、有利于远东和平，并使日本成为一个独立、自由、民主、和平的国家的对日和约而奋斗。但今天美国政府不顾中国人民和日本人民的抗议和反对，竟非法宣布单独对日和约生效，企图复活日本军国主义，重新侵略中国和亚洲。这是我们全中国的人民绝对不能容忍的。至于日本吉田反动政府在美国政府指使下与台湾国民党残匪签订的所谓“和平条约”，更是对中国人民的侮辱和挑衅，我们要坚决反对。我们坚决拥护周恩来外长的声明，为粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的任何新的战争冒险的阴谋而奋斗。
    民主建国会总会发言人说：美帝国主义宣布非法的单独对日和约生效等一系列的可耻的勾当，进一步暴露了它悍然背弃国际信义、制造侵略战争、奴役别国人民的罪行，已经达到疯狂透顶的地步。这是美帝国主义决计扩大远东战争的露骨的新的挑衅行为。中国人民决不允许它这些罪恶企图得逞！
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦说：美帝国主义者悍然宣布非法的单独对日和约生效等罪行，不但激起了中国人民无比的愤怒，而且也激起了日本、亚洲和全世界人民的无比愤怒。就在美国政府宣布非法的单独对日和约生效后的第三天——“五一”劳动节，三百万的日本劳动人民，在全国四百八十多处地方，展开了空前的英勇的示威。这是日本人民再一次地表示了他们反对单独和约、反对重新武装、反对美国侵略、反对战争和保卫和平的不可动摇的决心。中国人民一定要和日本人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民团结起来，为粉碎美帝国主义的新战争阴谋而斗争到底！
    中国农工民主党中央委员会的声明说：美国侵略者这一连串的破坏国际协定，坚持侵略和备战政策的非法与挑衅行为，无疑，会如它卑鄙无耻地违反国际公法的细菌战一样，是不可能吓倒伟大的中国人民的。中国人民反对美国侵略，保卫远东和世界和平的坚强意志，又一次集中表现于周恩来外长的严正声明中。中国农工民主党除了坚决表示拥护这一声明外，并号召全体党员与全国人民紧密地团结在中国共产党周围，制止美国在远东制造战争的阴谋，不达目的，决不休止！
    中国致公党的声明说：美国侵略者宣布非法的单独对日和约生效等罪行，不但对于中华人民共和国、苏联、及其他亚洲国家是露骨的威胁和侮辱，对日本人民也是一种极大的侮辱。因此，引起了一切爱好和平的人民的万分愤怒。我们坚决拥护周恩来外长的声明，绝对否认美帝国主义所宣布生效的非法单独对日和约和日蒋“和平条约”。
    九三学社发言人说：本社全体社员坚决拥护周恩来外长的严正声明，并愿在政府的庄严的号召之下，与全国文教科学工作者及全国人民紧密地团结起来，为彻底粉碎美国准备远东新侵略战争的阴谋，保卫祖国的安全与亚洲及世界的和平而奋斗。
    台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处代主任林云说：我外交部周恩来部长在五月五日发表的声明，代表了中国人民的反对美帝国主义罪行的坚强意志与决心。我们完全表示拥护。我们台湾同胞看得很清楚，龟缩在台湾的国民党残余匪帮，不会因美帝国主义的“援助”和所谓“和平条约”的签订，能延长其苟延残喘的命运。全中国人民，包括台湾人民在内，在英明的毛泽东主席领导下，不但有决心，而且有力量解放台湾。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会的声明说：我们代表全中国妇女热烈拥护我外交部周恩来部长的声明。全中国妇女绝对不承认并坚决反对美国政府所宣布生效的非法的单独对日和约。美国政府悍然宣布非法的单独对日和约生效等一连串阴谋活动的目的，显然是要变日本为其远东军事侵略网的中心和桥头堡，来准备一个包围新中国和苏联的新的远东侵略战争。侵略战争带给妇女和儿童的深重灾难，我们记忆犹新。我们一定要和全国人民一起坚决制止美国侵略者这种狂妄备战的阴谋。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会联合发表声明说：对于美帝国主义这一系列的严重的露骨的挑衅行为，我外交部周恩来部长已在五月五日发表声明，予以痛斥，并号召全国人民与全亚洲人民团结起来，制止美帝国主义在远东制造战争的危机。我们全国的青年和学生完全拥护周恩来外长的声明，并决心以实际行动来回击美帝国主义。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会的声明说：我们代表全国文学艺术工作者对周恩来外长的声明，表示坚决拥护。中国文学艺术工作者除了对美帝国主义的非法行动与狂妄阴谋表示坚决反对外，并誓与全国人民为击败美国反动派及其走狗们的一切侵略计划而坚决斗争。
