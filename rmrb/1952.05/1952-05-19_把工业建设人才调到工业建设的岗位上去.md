    Transfer Industrial Construction Talent to Industrial Construction Positions
    Du Huageng, Wu Jingshi, Li Ying
    Currently, the utilization of cadres is an important issue, especially the utilization of technical personnel in industrial departments. For example, the Electricity Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has only six university graduates in civil engineering and construction in the entire bureau. One person is in charge of technical leadership, one is engaged in structural stress analysis, and the remaining four are engaged in basic construction engineering design. However, it is difficult for these four people to do a good job in basic construction engineering design. However, some units do not have much work at present, but "store" a lot of technical personnel in preparation for "future tasks." For example, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Health Engineering Bureau has sixty or seventy technical personnel, some of whom are idle and bored. If organized a little better, the Health Engineering Bureau would not need so many cadres. Other departments also assign some university graduates in civil engineering and construction, or cadres with a foundation in this field, to do clerical work, secretarial work, and so on.
    In order to rationally use cadres, we put forward the following suggestions for relevant parties to consider: 1. In the future, cadres should be used rationally to avoid creating waste of cadres' expertise. 2. Regarding basic construction, it is hoped that relevant parties will consider establishing a unified leadership organization and rationally adjusting the use of relevant cadres, and transferring industrial construction talent from other departments to industrial construction positions. 3. In basic construction departments, there is a great shortage of cadres who are politically strong. Therefore, Party and League member cadres with technical foundations or with the potential to be cultivated should be gradually transferred from general administrative work as much as possible and placed in technical positions. On the one hand, they should be trained, and on the other hand, they should play a backbone role at the forefront of production and among technical personnel.

    把工业建设人才调到工业建设的岗位上去
    杜华庚·吴景实·李英
    目前，干部的使用是一个重要问题，特别是工业部门中技术人员的使用问题。如中央人民政府燃料工业部电业管理总局，全局只有六个大学毕业的土木建筑工程人员。其中一人担任技术领导工作，一人搞结构应力分析工作，其余四人搞基本建设工程设计。但是，这四个人是很难把基本建设工程设计搞好的。而有一些单位，目前工作并不多，却“储藏”了许多技术人员，以备迎接“将来的任务”。如北京市人民政府卫生工程局有六、七十个技术人员，其中有的闲得发闷。如果组织得好一点，卫生工程局是不需要这样多的干部的。其他部门，也有把一些大学毕业的土木建筑人员，或在这方面有基础的干部，派做文书、秘书等工作的。
    为了合理地使用干部，我们提出下面几点意见，供有关方面参考：一、今后要合理使用干部，避免造成不能发挥干部特长的浪费现象。二、关于基本建设，希望有关方面考虑成立统一的领导机构，并合理调整使用有关干部，把其他部门的工业建设人才抽调到工业建设岗位上去。三、在基本建设部门，政治上坚强的干部很缺少。所以，对具有技术根基或具有培养前途的党团员干部，应尽可能地从一般的行政工作中逐步抽调出来，把他们放到技术岗位上。一方面培养他们，一方面使他们在生产的最前线、在技术人员中起骨干作用。
