    Most of the Spring Repair Projects in the Huizhou Special District Completed; Some Projects Leak and Should Be Remedied Quickly
    Editor: This year, the achievements of the spring repair water conservancy projects in the Huizhou Special District of Southern Anhui Province have surpassed those of previous years. As of the 19th of last month, the entire special district had completed more than 16,700 projects, with more than 7,100 projects under construction or nearing completion. After all the projects are completed, a total of 472,000 mu of farmland can be irrigated, exceeding the original plan by 34 percent.
    However, in the spring repair projects, there are shortcomings such as simply pursuing quantity and not paying attention to quality. Some projects have experienced water leakage, and individual projects have even collapsed. For example, the masses in Liba Village, District Three, Shidai County, built ponds on flat ground, stacking embankments, which collapsed when hit by heavy rain. Another example is the Shuijieshan project in District Three, She County, where village cadres only focused on drought prevention and neglected drainage. The sluice gate on the project was originally planned to be nine chi wide, but was made six chi wide, which did not meet the standard of considering both drought and flood control. The Hehua Pond and Dagong Pond projects in Tangmo Village originally required 5,000 jin of lime, but only 3,000 jin were used, resulting in water leakage in both cases. The phenomenon of water leakage in projects is most prevalent in District Seven, Xiuning County, where seventeen out of twenty projects in one village in this district are leaking.
    Doing a good job in the spring repair of water conservancy projects is an important condition for striving for a bumper harvest this year. It is hoped that the Huizhou Special District will immediately correct the above-mentioned shortcomings.

### 徽州专区春修工程大部完工  某些工程漏水应速设法补救

    徽州专区春修工程大部完工  某些工程漏水应速设法补救
    编辑同志：今年皖南徽州专区春修水利工程的成绩超过了往年。到上月十九日止，全专区已完成工程一万六千七百多处，正在动工和即将完成的工程有七千一百多处。工程全部完成后，共可灌溉田地四十七万二千亩，超过原计划的百分之三十四。
    但是在春修工程中，有单纯追求数量不问质量的缺点，部分工程发生漏水现象，个别的工程已经倒塌。如石埭县三区历坝村群众，在平坦地上做塘，叠成围埂，结果给大雨一冲就倒塌了。又如歙县三区水界山工程，因为村干部只顾防旱，忽视了排水，工程上的水闸原计划九尺宽，却做了六尺，结果不合旱涝兼顾的标准。唐模村的荷花塘、大公塘两个工程本来要用五千斤石灰，只用了三千斤，结果都漏水。工程漏水的现象在休宁县七区发现最多，这区一个村的二十个工程就有十七个漏水。
    搞好水利工程的春修工作，是争取今年丰收的一个重要条件，希望徽州专区立即纠正上述缺点。
