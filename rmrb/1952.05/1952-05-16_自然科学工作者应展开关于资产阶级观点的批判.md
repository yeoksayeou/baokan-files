    Natural Science Workers Should Launch a Critique of Bourgeois Viewpoints
    Editor: Recently, after reading the book "Basic Principles of Michurin Biology," I realized that I am a very stubborn Mendelian. When I read Michurin's critique of Mendelian genetics, I couldn't help but feel hot all over. Because in 1950, when I was teaching, I was still spreading the reactionary Mendelian theory to students. This was very harmful to young students.
    As far as I know, many people who study natural sciences have not yet studied Michurin biology at all, and many people, even if they have heard something about it, have not paid due attention to it. Like me, they mistakenly believe that natural science workers can serve the people without undergoing ideological transformation. Now I understand that natural science workers must undergo ideological transformation and seriously criticize many erroneous theories in natural science. Only in this way can natural science workers better serve the economic construction of the motherland.　Jiang Zhongren

    自然科学工作者应展开关于资产阶级观点的批判
    编辑同志：最近我读了“米丘林生物学的基本原理”一书以后，认识到自己是一个很顽固的孟德耳主义者。当我读到米丘林学说对孟德耳遗传学说的批判时，不禁满身发热。因为我在一九五○年教书的时候，还向学生们传播反动的孟德耳学说。这对青年学生的危害是很大的。
    据我所知，有不少研究自然科学的人，到现在还根本没有学习米丘林生物学，很多人即使听到了一些，也没有予以应有的注意。他们和我一样，错误地以为自然科学工作者不经过改造，一样可以为人民服务。现在我才明白，自然科学工作者必须进行思想改造，并对自然科学中的许多错误的学说，加以认真的批判。只有这样，自然科学工作者才能更好地为祖国的经济建设服务。　姜忠仁
