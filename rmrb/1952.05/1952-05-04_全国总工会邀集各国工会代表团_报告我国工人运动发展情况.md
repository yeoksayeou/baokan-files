Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the material and cultural standards and political consciousness of the Chinese working class have been significantly improved. Now, the task of the Chinese working class is, on the one hand, to carry out a large-scale production increase and economy drive; on the other hand, to join with worker brothers all over the world to wage a resolute struggle to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression. Lai Ruoyu finally pointed out that no matter how crazy the imperialists are, the final victory will definitely belong to the working class of the whole world. At the end of the report, all the attending trade union representatives stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
