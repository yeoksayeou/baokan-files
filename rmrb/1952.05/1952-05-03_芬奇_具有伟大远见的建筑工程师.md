    Vinci - An Architectural Engineer with Great Vision
    Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin
    "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa," two famous paintings from the High Renaissance, are masterpieces known to every art student, and therefore every art student is familiar with the name of their creator, the great Leonardo da Vinci. He was not only an outstanding artist but also an outstanding scientist.
    Da Vinci's early environment was Florence, the most prosperous and culturally developed center of Italian handicrafts production. He resided for more than a decade in Milan, a major industrial city famous for manufacturing steelware and silk fabrics. From an early age, Vinci constantly sought patterns in natural phenomena for any work, aiming to understand the truth through practice, enhance human power to overcome nature, and make it serve life. He opposed the superstitious ignorance of the church at the time and the abstract, empty reasoning of the scholars. He believed that "science that does not originate from experiments is empty and wrong; experiments are the source of all truth," and said, "A person who only practices without science is like a sailor sailing without a rudder and compass. Practice must always be based on sound theory." His life's work was based on such insights.
    Much has been written about Vinci's contributions to art and natural science. This article focuses on his activities in civil engineering and architecture and the direction he advocated.
    In architecture, Vinci was very different from the famous architects of his time and the period before and after him. Although his name is often mentioned alongside great Renaissance architects, he did not leave behind a work such as a church or a building (except for a very unique spiral staircase at the Château de Blois in France, which is unconfirmed). Moreover, researchers of his historical materials know that many of his designs were almost never adopted; and for the projects that partially accepted his ideas, either they no longer exist today or there is no concrete evidence to prove which part used his designs or suggestions. However, his actual influence in engineering and architecture is undeniable. In contemporary and later records, his status as an architect was always recognized. Where does the problem lie? It lies in that his architectural and engineering insights, like many of his other contributions, were far ahead of his time, the vision of a pioneer. The reason why many of his plans could not be realized was precisely because they far exceeded the social system and consciousness of that era, exceeded the shortsighted and selfish demands of the feudal rulers of Italy at that time, and were distrusted, ignored, or obstructed by them. Many architectural designs at that time, from the appointment of architects to the selection and decision-making, were mostly controlled by feudal aristocrats. And among his peers, because Da Vinci participated in supervising many projects, competed for designs, and made countless sketches and suggestions, his outstanding theories and methods and original inventions spread great influence.
    Da Vinci studied painting under a painter, but painters at that time often doubled as sculptors and were able to carve stone or cast bronze. They also often had to cooperate closely with architects, and most of them were also architects capable of architectural design. They were all craftsmen who could do everything themselves. Da Vinci grew up in such an era, so his versatility is not surprising. What is remarkable is that in every field of work, his deep understanding and comprehensive development were gradually achieved by his descendants over decades or even centuries, gathering the wisdom of countless people. But he had already visionary, bravely explored forward, constantly researched, tried, and planned.
    Da Vinci's understanding of architectural engineering surpassed that of ordinary people, who were limited to the formal arrangement and construction of single buildings. Although in Da Vinci's time, the main architectural activities were designing domed cathedrals and the residences of dukes and marquises, with artistic layout and form as the focus, and with the rich decoration of stone carving and statues as the main work; the field of architectural engineering drafted by Da Vinci far exceeded this narrow scope. In addition to participating in competitions for church building designs, such as the cathedrals of Milan and Pavia, and the facade of San Lorenzo in Florence; supervising the Milan fortress and the interior of the Duke's palace; designing and being responsible for the construction of small memorial rooms and small pavilions in summer villas, the scope of architectural design that he voluntarily proposed was extremely broad, diverse, and mainly aimed at improving life. For example, he meticulously designed sanitary public toilets and stables; designed and drew detailed drawings of water-powered windmills that later became common in the Netherlands; he suggested designing a large number of standard workers' residences; he made a massive plan to rebuild the city of Milan, aiming to eliminate crowded and unsanitary environments; he designed and supervised several water conservancy projects and irrigation canals, the most important of which was the canal between Florence and Pisa. He drew a beautiful and detailed map of the Arno River, suggesting controlling the upstream and downstream of the river to facilitate many industries that could use water power as motivation; he confidently believed that this was a plan that could simultaneously prosper several cities along the river. This plan is the precursor to today's most advanced planned economy, "regional planning."
    Urban planning and regional planning are architectural problems that people in the twentieth century only proposed to solve more than four hundred years after Da Vinci's death. His plan can only be seriously implemented and developed in advanced socialist countries even now. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it is understandable that all of his architectural engineering plans were either not adopted or abandoned halfway due to insufficient and universal support. But Da Vinci did not lose the courage to pursue truth and continuously make rational plans throughout his life due to the frustration or non-implementation of his plans. Until his later years, before his death, he also made plans for the canal between the Loire and Saône rivers in France, with the aim of benefiting from irrigation, navigation, and water power. He had unparalleled confidence in transforming nature and peaceful construction.
    The content of Da Vinci's urban planning is correct in terms of items and direction. It starts from reality and solves the most basic problems. Although limited by the social system and conditions at that time, it mainly aimed to eliminate the diseases, unsanitary conditions, unrest, and unpleasant environment caused by urban congestion. The lessons of the rampant plague in Milan from 1484 to 1486 prompted him to draft his plan to rebuild Milan. Da Vinci boldly divided Milan into several districts. To reduce population density, noise, the spread of diseases, bad odors, and other unsanitary conditions, he suggested building ten urban areas, each with 5,000 houses and a population of 30,000. He suggested building the city on the riverbank or seashore in order to set up a system of underground gutters for discharging sewage and garbage, using running water to wash away all dirt into the river. He suggested setting up open and covered drainage ditches on streets and alleys to avoid the accumulation of rainwater and sewage; building standardized workers' residences, building public toilets, reforming citizens' unsanitary habits, paying attention to the structure of chimneys, and driving smoke and odors out of the city; and to ensure air and sunlight in the city, the width of streets and the height of houses should have a certain proportion. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the focus of urban construction was on defense engineering, and the city itself was often regarded as a secondary accessory. Da Vinci lived in an era when Italian cities were often threatened by wars between rulers. His job was many times to supervise fortresses and strengthen defense engineering, but he was concerned about the city itself and the lives of peaceful residents. But the ignorant and selfish Ludovico was deaf and had no intention of accepting this suggestion.
    Da Vinci also had foresight on the development direction of the construction industry. He had made similar suggestions to modern "prefabricated houses." When he was in a French town, wood was the main building material there. Because it was the location of the summer palace, there was a large demand for houses. He suggested building mobile houses, with each part prefabricated in urban workshops, which could be transported to any location and quickly installed at any time.
    An example of Da Vinci's "regional planning" is the construction of the canal between Florence and Pisa. He estimated that this water conservancy project could prosper several towns in that area, such as Prato, Pistoia, Pisa, Florence itself, and even Lucca. He believed that it was a measure that could promote many industrial productions, so he not only suggested it to the local administrative responsible parties, but also persuaded various industrial and commercial guilds to give support. Especially the Wool Weavers' Guild, which was one of the most important industries in Florence. Da Vinci believed that there were many handicraft workshops that could be built along the river to use water power, such as mills, silk weaving workshops, pottery workshops, iron smelting, knife grinding, and paper making workshops. He also specifically mentioned that silk spinning could provide hundreds of female workers with jobs. In his own words, "If we can control the upstream and downstream of the Arno River, everyone, if he wants, can get treasures on every hectare of land." He once designed an engineering plan for navigation on different heights due to a high terrain in the middle section of the canal. Vasari, a biographer of the sixteenth century, said that Da Vinci was making maps or models every day, explaining how easily mountains can be moved and rivers opened! This shows how convinced the genius engineer was that human power can overcome nature and serve a better life. This is the spirit that we peace-loving people should learn from him.
    In addition, the correctness of Da Vinci's insights on individual architectural engineering should also be fully mentioned. In addition to the artistic style of architectural form organization, he consciously emphasized two elements of architectural engineering. One is the importance of tool efficiency for perfecting engineering, and the other is that the solidity and health of buildings must rely on the enrichment of natural science knowledge. What a correct and progressive view this is. Regarding the importance of tools, for example, in his early days in Milan, when he was making the Sforza bronze statue, he could see every day from upstairs that the Milan Cathedral, which was being built but could never be completed. He noticed the difficulty of workers moving stone statues and transporting stone pillars, and also noticed the low efficiency of their woodworking tools, so he often designed many tool drawings in his manuscripts, such as tools for digging foundations and raising stones, shovels, hammers, wheelbarrows for moving soil, and so on. More than ten years later, when he was supervising the canal project, he observed the number of movements required for workers to dig a shovel of soil and calculated the amount of soil that each worker could dig in two days. He designed a soil digging elevator using cattle power and calculated the number of times it went up and down every day and compared it with manual work. This method of calculating efficiency with precise numbers has only been applied in modern times, but Da Vinci already understood its importance in engineering at that time.
    Regarding the relationship between engineering and architecture, his views on architectural engineering can be represented by a passage from his letter to the person in charge of the Milan Cathedral. The letter said: "Just as doctors and nurses need to know the nature of people, life, and health, and know that the balance and harmony of various factors maintain people, life, and health, or that the disharmony of various factors harms and destroys them... Similarly, this sick church also needs all of this; it needs a 'doctor architect' who understands the nature of a building, understands the rules that must be followed for correct construction methods, and the sources and categories of these rules, and the reasons that make a building exist and can be permanent." He valued "doctor architects" so much, and the task of the so-called "doctor architect" was his tireless pursuit of the laws of nature.
    In terms of architectural style, Da Vinci was in the late "Gothic" architecture era, when classical architecture was rediscovered and adopted. His design naturally combined the foundation of Gothic structure with classical style. His style is therefore very similar to Byzantine characteristics - the format produced by the combination of classical architecture and domes, with small domes supporting a particularly large central dome. In terms of boldness and ornamentation, the style that Vinci tended to was neither what ancient Rome had nor different from the typical style of the later Renaissance. For example, his many drafts proposed in the designs of Milan Cathedral and Pavia Cathedral tried all possible combinations and changes. He emphasized the plan of a true cross, the so-called "Greek cross," and avoided the plan of a "Latin cross" with a longer front part. He understood that the plan of a true cross was more suitable for the application of domes, and the integrity of the entire church could be viewed from any side without being destroyed by a longer part. Today, St. Peter's Basilica in Rome has suffered losses due to the excessive expansion of the front part. Da Vinci's style in church design shows that he is also extremely sensitive and pursues perfection in the organization of forms. As for his abundant imagination and familiarity with structural principles, it is reflected in theatrical scenery, celebration venue arrangements, and garden deployments. Many of his outstanding designs were original to him and led to new developments in later designs. If the spiral staircase in the Château de Blois in France was indeed designed by him, we can see his interest in spiral structures and his special style; but because of insufficient evidence, we cannot be so sure. He designed an iron bridge at that time, and iron bridges were only able to appear for the first time in England at the end of the eighteenth century. All of this shows that he was a genius of architecture and engineering; an advanced giant in the architectural engineering world.
    Like his many aspects, Da Vinci has a wide range of knowledge and unique talents in the field of architectural engineering. Constantly observing nature, overcoming nature, and always having the confidence to create is his consistent spirit. His ideals and work are a treasure of human culture. This is enough to explain why we want to warmly commemorate him in today's world that strives for peace.

    芬奇——具有伟大远见的建筑工程师
    梁思成  林徽因
    “最后的晚餐”和“蒙娜丽莎”像，这两幅文艺复兴全盛时期的名画，是每一个艺术学生所认识的杰作，因此每一个艺术学生都熟识它们的作者——伟大的辽奥纳多·达·芬奇的名字。他不但是杰出的艺术家，而且是杰出的科学家。
    达·芬奇青年时期的环境是意大利手工业生产最旺盛的文化发达的佛罗仑斯，他居留过十余年的米兰是以制造钢铁器和丝织著名的工业大城。从早年起，对于任何工作，芬奇就是不断地在自然现象中寻找规律，要在实践中认识真理，提高人的力量来克服自然，使它为生活服务。他反对当时教会的迷信愚昧，也反对当时学究们的抽象空洞的推论。他认为“不从实验中产生的科学都是空的、错误的；实验是一切真实性的源泉”，并说：“只会实行而没有科学的人，正如水手航海而没有舵和指南针一样。实践必须永远以健全的理论为基础。”他一生的工作都是依据了这样的见解而进行的。
    关于芬奇在艺术和自然科学方面的贡献，已有很多专文，本文只着重介绍他在土木工程和建筑范围内所进行的活动和所主张的方向。
    在建筑方面，芬奇同他的前后时代大名鼎鼎的建筑师们是极不相同的。虽然他的名字常同文艺复兴大建筑师们相提并列，但他并没有一个作品如教堂、或大厦之类留存到今天（除却一处在法国布洛阿宫尚无法证实而非常独特的螺旋楼梯之外）。不但如此，研究他的史料的人都还知道他的许多设计，几乎每个都不曾被采用；而部分接受他的意见的工程，今天或已不存或无确证可以证明哪一部分曾用过他的设计或建议的。但是他在工程和建筑方面的实际影响又是不可否认的。在他同时代和较晚的纪录上，他的建筑师地位总是受到公认的。这问题在哪里呢？在于他的建筑上和工程上的见解，和他的其他许多贡献一样，是远远地走在时代的前面的先驱者的远见。他的许多计划之所以不能实现，正是因为它们远远超过了那时代的社会制度和意识，超过了当时意大利封建统治者的短视和自私自利的要求，为他们所不信任、所忽视或阻挠。当时的许多建筑设计，由指派建筑师到选择和决定，大都是操在封建贵族手中的。而在同行之间，由于达·芬奇参加监修许多的工程和竞选过设计，且做过无数草图和建议，他的杰出的理论和方法，独创的发明，就都传播了很大的影响。
    达·芬奇是在画师门下学习绘画的，但当时的画师常兼长雕刻，并且或能刻石，或能铸铜，又常须同建筑师密切合作，自己多半也都是能作建筑设计的建筑师。他们都是一切能自己动手的匠师。在这样的时代里成长的达·芬奇，他的才艺的多面性本不足惊奇，可异的是在每一部门的工作中，他的深入的理解和全面性的发展都是他的后代在数十年乃至数世纪中，汇集了无数人的智慧才逐渐达到的。而他却早就有远见地、勇敢地摸索前进，不断地研究、尝试和计划过。
    达·芬奇对建筑工程的理解是超过一般人局限于单座建筑物的形式部署和建造的。虽然在达·芬奇的时代，最主要建筑活动是设计穹窿顶的大教堂和公侯的府第等，以艺术的布局和形式为重点，且以雕石、刻像的富丽装璜为主要工作；但达·芬奇所草拟过的建筑工程领域却远超过这个狭隘的范围。他除了参加竞赛设计过教堂建筑，如米兰和帕维亚大教堂、佛罗仑斯的圣罗伦索的立面等；监修过米兰的堡垒和公爵府内部；设计并负责修造过小纪念室和避暑庄园中小亭子之外，他所自动提出的建筑设计的范围极广，种类很多，且主要都是以改善生活为目标的。例如他尽心地设计改善卫生的公厕和马厩；设计并详尽地绘制了后来在荷兰才普遍的水力风车的碾房的图样；他建议设计大量标准工人住宅；他做了一个志在消除拥挤和不卫生环境的庞大的米兰城改建的计划；他曾设计并监修过好几处的水利工程、灌溉水道，最重要的，如佛罗仑斯和毘萨之间的运河。他为阿尔诺河绘制过美丽而详细的地图，建议控制河的上下游，以便利许多可以利用水力作为发动力的工业；他充满信心地认为这是可以同时繁荣沿河几个城市的计划。这个策划正是今天最进步的计划经济中的“区域计划”的先声。
    都市计划和区域计划都是达·芬奇去世四百多年以后，二十世纪的人们才提出解决的建筑问题。他的计划就是在现在也只有在先进的社会主义国家里才有力量认真实行和发展的。在十五、十六世纪的年代里，他的一切建筑工程计划或不被采用，或因得不到足够和普遍的支持，半途而废，是可以理解的。但达·芬奇一生并不因计划受挫，或没有实行，而失掉追求真理和不断作理智策划的勇气。直到他的晚年，在逝世以前，他在法国还做了鲁尔河和宋河间运河的计划，且目的在灌溉、航运、水力三方面的利益。对于改造自然，和平建设，他是具有无比信心的。
    达·芬奇的都市计划的内容中，项目和方向都是正确的，它是由实际出发，解决最基本的问题的。虽受当时的社会制度和条件的限制，但主要是要消除城市的拥挤所造成的疾病、不卫生、不安宁和不愉快的环境。一四八四至八六年间米兰鼠疫猖狂的教训，使他草拟了他的改建米兰的计划。达·芬奇大胆地将米兰分划为若干区，为减少人口的密度，喧哗嘈杂，疾病的传播，恶劣的气味，和其他不卫生情形，他建议建造十个城区，每城区房屋五千，人口三万。他建议把城市建置在河岸或海边，以便设置排泄污水垃圾的暗沟系统，利用流水冲洗一切藏垢到河内。他建议设置街巷上的排水明沟和暗沟衔接，以免积存雨水和污物；建造规格化的工人住宅，建造公厕，改革市民的不卫生的习惯，注意烟囱的构造，将烟和臭气驱逐出城；且为保证市内空气和阳光，街道的宽度和房屋的高度要有一定的比例。在十五、十六世纪间，都市建设的重点在防御工程，城市的本身往往被视为次要的附属品，达·芬奇生在意大利各城市时常受到统治者之间争夺战威胁的时代，他的职务很多次都是监修堡垒，加固防御工程，但他所关心的却是城市本身和平居民的生活。但当时愚昧自私的卢多维柯是充耳不闻，无心接受这种建议的。
    对于建筑工业的发展方向，达·芬奇也有预见。近代的“预制房屋”，他就曾做过类似的建议。当他在法国乡镇的时候，木材是那里主要的建筑材料，因为是夏天行宫所在，有大量房屋的需要，他曾建议建造可移动的房屋，各部分先在城市作坊中预制，可以运至任何地点随时很快地装置起来。
    达·芬奇的“区域计划”的例子，是修建佛罗仑斯和毘萨之间的运河。他估计到这个水利工程可以繁荣那一带好几个城镇，如普拉图，皮斯托亚，毘萨，佛罗仑斯本身，乃至于卢卡。他相信那是可以促进许多工业生产的措施，因此他不但向地方行政负责方面建议，同时他也劝各工商行会给予支持。尤其是毛织业行会，它是佛罗仑斯最主要工业之一。达·芬奇认为还有许许多多手工业作坊都可以沿河建置，以利用水的动力，如碾坊、丝织业作坊、窑业作坊、镕铁、磨刀、做纸等作坊。他还特别提到纺丝可以给上百的女工以职业。用他自己的话说：“如果我们能控制阿尔诺河的上下游，每个人，如果他要的话，在每一公顷的土地上都可以得到珍宝。”他曾因运河中段地区有一处地势高起，设计过在不同高度的水平上航行的工程计划。十六世纪的传记家伐莎利说，达·芬奇每天都在制图或作模型，说明如何容易地可以移山开河！这正说明这位天才工程师是如何地确信人的力量能克服自然，为更美好的生活服务。这就是我们争取和平的人们要向他学习的精神。
    此外，达·芬奇对个别建筑工程见解的正确性也应该充分提到。他在建筑的体形组织的艺术性风格之外，还意识地着重建筑工程上两个要素。一是工具效率对于完善工程的重要，一是建筑的坚固和康健必须倚赖自然科学知识的充实。这是多么正确和进步的见解。关于工具的重视，例如他在米兰的初期，正在作斯佛尔查铜像时，每日可以在楼上望见正在建造而永无法完工的米兰大教堂，他注意到工人搬移石像、起运石柱的费力，也注意到他们木工用具效率之低，于是时常在他手稿上设计许多工具的画样，如掘地基和起石头的器具，铲子、锤子、搬土的手推车等等。十多年后，当他监修运河工程时，他观察到工人每挖一铲土所需要的动作次数，计算每工两天所能挖的土方。他自己设计了一种用牛力的挖土升降机，计算它每日上下次数和人工作了比较。这种以精确数字计算效率是到了近代才应用的方法，当时达·芬奇却已了解它在工程中的重要了。
    关于工程和建筑的关系，他对于建筑工程的看法可以从他给米兰大教堂负责人的信中一段来代表他的见解。信中说：“就如同医生和护士需要知道人和生命和健康的性质，知道各种因素之平衡与和谐保持了人和生命和健康，或是各种因素之不和谐危害并毁灭它们一样……同样的，这个有病的教堂也需要这一切；它需要一个‘医生建筑师’，他懂得一个建筑物的性质，懂得正确建造方法所须遵守的法则，以及这些法则的来源与类别，和使一座建筑物存在并能永久的原因。”他是这样地重视“医生建筑师”，而所谓“医生建筑师”的任务则是他那不倦地追求自然规律的精神。
    在建筑的艺术作风方面，达·芬奇是在“高特”建筑末期，古典建筑重新被发现被采用的时代，他的设计是很自然地把高特结构的基础和古典风格相结合。他的作风因此非常近似于拜占廷式的特征，——那个古典建筑和穹窿顶结合所产生的格式，以小型的穹窿顶衬托中心特大的穹窿圆顶。在豪放和装饰性方面，芬奇所倾向的风格都不是古罗马所曾有，也不同于后来文艺复兴的典型作风。例如他的米兰教堂和帕维亚教堂的设计中所拟的许多稿图，把各种可能的结合和变化都尝试了。他强调正十字形的平面，所谓“希腊十字形”，而避免前部较长的“拉丁十字形”的平面。他明白正十字形平面更适合于穹窿顶的应用，无论从任何一面都可以瞻望教堂全部的完整性，不致被较长的一部所破坏。今天罗马圣彼得教堂就因前部的过分扩充而受到损失的。达·芬奇在教堂设计的风格上，显示他对体形组织也是极端敏感并追求完美的。至于他的幻想力的充沛，对结构原理的谙熟，就表现在戏剧布景、庆贺的会场布置和庭园部署等方面。他所做过的卓越的设计，许多曾是他所独创，而且是引导出后代设计的新发展。如果在法国布洛阿宫中的旋梯楼确是他所设计，我们更可以看出他对于螺旋结构的兴趣和他的特殊的作风；但因证据不足，我们不能这样断定。他在当时就设计过一个铁桥，而铁桥是到了十八世纪末叶在英国才能够初次出现。凡此种种都说明他是一个建筑和工程的天才；建筑工程界的先进的巨人。
    和他的许多方面一样，达·芬奇在建筑工程的领域中，有着极广的知识和独到的才能。不断观察自然、克服自然、永有创造的信心，是他一贯的精神。他的理想和工作是人类文化的宝藏。这也就足以说明为什么在今天争取和平的世界里，我们要热烈地纪念他。
