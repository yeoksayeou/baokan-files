To the Editor:

In late 1950, to promptly supply the needs of farmers, the workers of our Jinan No. 2 Machine Factory went all out to produce over 20,000 waterwheels. At the time, in order to improve the efficiency of making waterwheel pipes, I wanted to create a drum machine for making waterwheel pipes. After more than a month of painstaking research, I successfully developed a preliminary design for the drum machine. I gave the drawings to the factory director, but the factory director felt that the task of making waterwheels was almost complete, so he did not value this drum machine, nor did he want us to trial-produce one. This drum machine drawing sat in my home for more than a year. Last November, a section chief from the preparatory committee of the China Machine Manufacturing Trade Union came to Jinan, and I gave him the drum machine drawings. But he has not given me a reply to this day. This matter shows that the leadership does not sufficiently value this drum machine that I researched. In order to better stimulate the production enthusiasm and creativity of workers, I believe that in the future Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, leading cadres of all factories and mines should highly cherish the creations of workers and hope that newspapers will report more on the difficulties of workers in the creative process and help solve them in a timely manner.

Industrial Labor Model Liu Qingxiang

Editor's Note: The preparatory committee of the China Machine Manufacturing Trade Union and the Jinan No. 2 Machine Factory should thoroughly examine their attitude towards the creations of labor model Liu Qingxiang and should publicly publish the results of the examination.

    刘庆祥创造的卷筒机图样为什么没有被重视
    编辑同志：一九五零年年底，我们济南第二机器厂职工，为及时供应农民需要，全力赶制两万多部水车。当时，为了提高制水管子的效率，我想创制一部制水管子的卷筒机。我经过一个多月的苦心钻研，已把卷筒机的初步图案研究成功了。我把图纸交给厂长，厂长认为制水车的任务快完了，没有重视这个卷筒机，更没有要我们试制一部。这一卷筒机的图纸就在我家放了一年多。去年十一月，中国机器制造业工会筹备委员会有一个科长到济南来，我把卷筒机图纸交给他。但他到现在也没有给我回信。从这件事可以说明，领导方面对我所研究的这部卷筒机是不够重视的。为了更好地启发职工的生产积极性和创造性，我认为在今后的增产节约运动中，各厂矿领导干部应十分珍视职工的创造，并希望报纸多反映职工在创造过程中的困难，及时帮助解决。　工业劳动模范　刘庆祥
    编者按：中国机器制造业工会筹备委员会和
    济南第二机器厂厂方应彻底检查对待劳动模范
    刘庆祥的创造的态度，并应将检查结果公开
    发表。
