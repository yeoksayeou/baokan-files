    Beijing Machine Factory Workers
    Organize Volunteer Labor Team to Build Dormitories
    Editor: The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to solve the worker dormitory problem, has decided to build a batch of dormitories for workers. The dormitories for our Beijing Machine Factory are being built in the eastern suburbs, and construction began on May 10th. All of our employees were very happy to hear the news that dormitories were being built for us, and we sincerely appreciate the government's care for the workers. The 10th was our day off. Under the call of the trade union, we organized a volunteer labor team to do the work of repairing and leveling the foundation. On the 10th, five hundred male and female employees participated in the work. Each workshop unit formed five teams, holding high the big red flag of "Volunteer Labor," and marched to the construction site, beating waist drums. We started working at 9:00 AM. First, the Forging and Riveting Team issued a challenge, guaranteeing to complete the task before 12:00, and to repair and level the ground smoothly and neatly. Each team then accepted the challenge. Because there were not enough tools, the Machining Team created a game of tamping the ground to level it, and the Foundry and Carpentry Team used wooden boards instead of rakes to do the work. The Forging and Riveting Team completed all its work in less than two hours, and actively assisted other teams. The workers' enthusiasm for labor was very high. Factory Director Ji Hequn also participated in the labor, which further encouraged our morale. The loudspeaker constantly broadcasted good news from each team. The task was completed in less than three hours. We all looked at the results of our labor with infinite joy, and some people said, "In less than three months, we can live in new houses!"

    北京机器厂工人
    组织义务劳动队建筑宿舍
    编辑同志：北京市人民政府为了解决工人宿舍问题，决定给工人修盖一批宿舍。我们北京机器厂的宿舍在东郊，五月十日已经动工修盖。我们全体职工听到给我们修盖宿舍的消息后，都非常高兴，打心眼里感激政府对工人的照顾。十日正是我们的休息日。我们在工会的号召下，组织了义务劳动队，做修垫地基工作。十日那天，五百个男女职工参加了工作。各车间单位组成五个中队，高举着“义务劳动”大红旗，打着腰鼓，向工地前进。我们在上午九时开始工作。首先由锻铆中队提出挑战，保证十二点前完成任务，并要修垫得又平又整齐。各中队相继都应了战。因为工具不够，机工中队创造游戏踏地法来踏平地，铸木中队用木板代替耙子来干活。锻铆中队不到两个钟点就全部把本段工作做好，并积极协助其他中队。工人们劳动热情非常高涨。厂长吉合群也参加了劳动，这更鼓舞了我们的情绪。广播器不断传来各中队的捷报。不到三小时，任务就完成了。我们都以无限愉快的心情看着劳动的成果，有的人说：“不到三个月，我们就可以住新房子啦！”
