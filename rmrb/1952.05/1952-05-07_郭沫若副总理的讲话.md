Comrade Kopecky, Ambassador, Comrades:

Today, China and Czechoslovakia signed the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Sino-Czech Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, the Sino-Czech Postal Agreement, and the Sino-Czech Telecommunications Agreement, which are of great significance. The conclusion of these agreements indicates that the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia is becoming increasingly consolidated and opens up infinitely bright prospects for future friendly cooperation. Therefore, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and myself, I express my warm congratulations on the signing of these agreements.

Since the people of China and Czechoslovakia have both been liberated, have taken control of their own governments, and are actively engaged in peaceful construction in various fields to create a better economic life, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Czechoslovakia, in terms of cultural exchanges, such as exchanging students, exchanging films and books and magazines, organizing exhibitions for each other, and sending delegations to visit each other, much work has been done that is conducive to mutual understanding and strengthening friendship between the two peoples. In the economic field, equal and mutually beneficial barter trade has been carried out. China has imported machinery, equipment, and transportation tools necessary for economic construction from Czechoslovakia, and has also received technical assistance from Czech experts; Czechoslovakia has obtained necessary industrial raw materials and agricultural products from China. At the same time, with the growth of cultural and economic cooperation between the two countries, China and Czechoslovakia had already established close postal and telecommunications links before the agreements were signed.

The signing of the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement today will play a greater role in the future development and progress of culture in the two countries, the improvement of the people's cultural life, and the common struggle against imperialist ideology. The Sino-Czech Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement will be of great help to the economic construction of China and Czechoslovakia, especially to the improvement of science and technology in China. The two Sino-Czech postal and telecommunications agreements will provide convenient and good communication conditions for enhancing friendly relations between the two countries and close economic and cultural exchanges. When American imperialism violated international law, disregarded the opposition of the people of the world, and launched a barbaric bacteriological war against Korea and China, massacring the heroic Chinese and Korean people, and attempting to strangle the science and culture of the world, the signing of these agreements embodies the common will of the people of China and Czechoslovakia to fight for peace. These agreements will not only greatly help the development of economy, culture, science, post and telecommunications of China and Czechoslovakia, but also make great contributions to strengthening the peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union and safeguarding the world's science and culture.

Finally, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and myself, I express my heartfelt thanks to the delegation of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic headed by Comrade Kopecky and to the Ambassador of the Czechoslovak Republic to China, Mr. Kousal, for their efforts in promoting Sino-Czech friendly relations.

Long live the friendly cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia!
Long live the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live President Gottwald!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
Long live Marshal Stalin!

    郭沫若副总理的讲话
    柯别茨基团长，大使，诸位同志：
    中捷两国今天签订了具有重大意义的中捷文化合作协定，中捷科学与技术合作协定，中捷邮政协定与中捷电信协定。这些协定的缔结，表明了中捷两国的友谊日益巩固，并对将来的友好合作开辟了无限光明的前途。因此，我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府、中国人民及我个人，对这些协定的签订表示热烈的庆贺。
    由于中捷两国人民都已获得了解放，自己掌握了政权，并且都在积极地进行各方面的和平建设，创造更美好的经济生活，因此中捷两国建交以来，在文化交流方面，如交换留学生、交换影片及书刊杂志，互相组织展览会，及互派代表团参观访问等，已经做了许多有利于两国人民互相了解和加强友谊的工作。在经济方面，进行了平等、互利的换货贸易。中国自捷输入了经济建设所必需的机器、器材及交通工具等，并且还得到捷专家在技术上的帮助；捷则自中国获得了必要的工业原料和农产品。同时随着两国文化、经济合作的增长，早在签订协定以前，中捷两国就已经建立了邮政电信的密切联系。
    今天中捷文化合作协定的签订，对今后两国文化的发展进步，人民文化生活的提高，及在共同反对帝国主义思想意识的斗争中，将起更大的作用。中捷科学与技术合作协定，对中捷两国的经济建设，特别对中国科学与技术的提高，会有很大的帮助。中捷邮政与电信两协定，对增进两国友好关系，密切经济与文化往来，将提供方便而良好的通讯条件。当美帝国主义违犯国际公法，不顾世界人民的反对，向朝鲜及中国发动了野蛮的细菌战，屠杀英勇的中朝人民，并企图绞杀世界人类的科学与文化的时候，这些协定的签订，正体现了中捷两国人民为和平而斗争的共同意志。这些协定不仅对中捷两国的经济、文化、科学、邮电的发展有很大帮助，而且对加强以伟大苏联为首的和平民主阵营，对保卫世界的科学与文化，也会有很大的贡献。
    最后我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府、中国人民及我个人，对以柯别茨基同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团和捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻华大使康萨拉，为中捷友好关系所作的努力表示衷心的感谢。
    中捷友好合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营万岁！
    哥特瓦尔德总统万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
