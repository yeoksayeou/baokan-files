    Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Long-Distance Division Long-Distance Station
    The stationmaster's bureaucratic work style is very serious
    Editor: Since the beginning of this year, the Long-Distance Station of the Long-Distance Division of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has never assigned production tasks to the various sections of the long-distance lines under its jurisdiction, making it impossible for the line workers to carry out their work. Zhang Enxiang, a long-distance lineman from Fengtai, raised objections to the long-distance station at the anti-bureaucracy meeting on February 3. This opinion was conveyed to the Long-Distance Division by the director of the Fengtai Business Office, but there has been no response to date. The directors of the Fengtai and Changxindian business offices jointly submitted their opinions to Stationmaster Liu of the Long-Distance Station of the Long-Distance Division, but Liu said: "The 'Three-Anti' study is very busy, and the Long-Distance Division has not approved a plan." A few days later, he said, "Why don't you make your own plans first." Although the linemen from Fengtai and Changxindian made their own plans, a lot of time and manpower was wasted. Zhang Enxiang, a lineman from Fengtai, worked only more than 120 hours in the first quarter; calculated on an eight-hour workday, excluding rest days, he wasted more than 510 working hours. Two linemen from Changxindian wasted more than 1,100 working hours in the first quarter. If we add up the wasted figures for the entire district, the number will be even more alarming. In fact, it is not that there is no work to be done in each section. For example, the current work of painting, inspecting, and consolidating the long-distance pole lines is urgent. The long-distance station receives reports every month, and this problem should have been solved long ago. However, when the director of the Fengtai Business Office recently asked Stationmaster Liu for his opinion on the waste problem, he actually said: "I have not read this year's reports. Someone else read the reports for January and February." Stationmaster Liu has not known the work situation of the linemen under his jurisdiction for several months. This serious bureaucratic work style continues to exist even after the "Three-Anti" movement. This is intolerable and should be corrected immediately.

### 北京电信局长途处长途站  站长官僚主义作风十分严重

    北京电信局长途处长途站
    站长官僚主义作风十分严重
    编辑同志：北京电信局长途处长途站，自今年年初到现在，从来没有给所辖的长途线路各段布置生产任务，使各包线员无法进行工作。丰台长途线务员张恩祥曾在二月三日反官僚主义的会上对长途站提出意见。这个意见曾由丰台营业处主任转告长途处，但到现在还没有回讯。丰台、长辛店两处的营业处主任曾联合把意见提给长途处长途站刘站长，但刘说：“‘三反’学习很忙，长途处没有批下计划。”过几天，他又说：“你们自己先订一下计划吧。”丰台、长辛店两处的线务员自己虽然订了计划，但时间和人力浪费得很多。丰台线务员张恩祥在第一季度只工作了一百二十多小时；若按八小时工作制计算，除休息日外，他浪费了五百一十多工作小时。长辛店两个线务员第一季度浪费了一千一百多工作小时。如果把全区的浪费数字加起来，就更惊人了。事实上，各段并不是没有工作做，如目前长途杆线的刷油、验杆、培固等工作都是急待做的。长途站每个月都收到报告，早就应该解决这个问题。但最近丰台营业处主任问刘站长对浪费问题有何意见时，他竟说：“今年的报告我一直没看过，由另外的人看了一、二月份的报告了。”刘站长好几个月不知道所辖各线务员的工作情况，这种严重的官僚主义作风，竟在“三反”运动后继续存在，这是使人不能容忍的，应当立即改正。
