Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 25th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 25th that on May 13th of this year, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs received identical notes from the U.S., British, and French embassies in Moscow, containing the U.S., British, and French governments' responses to the Soviet government's April 9th note regarding a peace treaty with Germany.

On May 24th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered the Soviet government's reply to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and France.

The full text of the note presented by the U.S. government on May 13, 1952, and the Soviet government's reply on May 24, 1952, are as follows:

The note presented by the U.S. government on May 13, 1952:

"The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the United States of America presents his compliments to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and has the honor, under instructions from his Government, to state the following:

(1) In reply to the Soviet Government's note of April 9, the United States Government wishes to express its views on the issues of German unification, the election of a free all-German government, and the conclusion of a peace treaty with that government. The policy of the United States Government remains to achieve these three goals under conditions that ensure free unification and secure peace.

(2) The United States Government is willing to begin negotiations with the Soviet Government on these issues; it is willing to begin negotiations as soon as it becomes clear that the Soviet Government is also willing to avoid the kind of fruitless negotiations that have occurred in the past. Therefore, the United States Government, along with the governments of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, must first reach a clear understanding on the scope of the negotiations and the fundamental issues to be studied. Proper preparation is essential for success and to avoid prolonged delays. The Soviet Government's note of April 9 offers little new insight into how it believes such negotiations should be ensured to succeed.

(3) In its recent note, the Soviet Government stipulated that Germany should not join 'any group of states aimed at any peace-loving country.' However, if Germany joins the United Nations, any such provision would naturally be unnecessary. In any case, the United States Government cannot agree to any clauses that prohibit Germany from forming alliances with other countries, regardless of whether one of the signatories to the treaty might arbitrarily consider the alliance to be 'directed against peace-loving countries.' As a free and equal nation, Germany has the fundamental right to form peaceful alliances with other countries, and the United States Government cannot agree to deprive it of this fundamental right. It can be assumed that the Soviet Government would likewise not oppose Germany's right to conclude defensive agreements.

(4) In its note of March 25, the United States Government pointed out that it is fully supporting the activities of the free nations of Western Europe—including the Federal Republic of Germany. These countries are striving to establish a peaceful European group, thereby initiating a new era in international relations based not on hostility and suspicion but on cooperation. The United States Government welcomes the establishment of such a European group with German participation. The division of Germany is because Europe is also divided. This policy of uniting Europe does not threaten the interests of the Soviet Union, nor does it threaten the interests of countries whose policies are dedicated to maintaining peace. Therefore, the United States Government will continue to support this policy. It is more convinced than ever that this policy represents the true path to peace.

(5) The United States Government cannot be held responsible for the fact that this cooperation cannot be extended beyond its current scope. The United States Government remains willing to genuinely and sincerely study any practical and correct suggestions aimed at easing tensions and remedying existing divisions.

(6) To conclude a peace treaty with Germany, there must be a freely elected all-German government that is able to participate fully in the discussion of this treaty. Therefore, it is not possible to discuss the terms of a peace treaty with Germany at this time. The United States Government has indicated its views on several of the Soviet Government's suggestions, particularly the Soviet Union's misinterpretation of the territorial provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and its intention to isolate Germany permanently from Western Europe while requiring it to defend itself entirely with its own national armed forces. The Soviet proposals would mean permanently restricting Germany's right to conclude international covenants, and would mean perpetual tension and unrest in the center of Europe.

(7) The all-German government, freely elected, must itself be free. This freedom is necessary both before and after the treaty is negotiated. This government must be able to maintain its genuine representativeness, to fulfill its responsibilities as the government of a reunified Germany, and to play its full role in the discussion of the treaty. Therefore, the issue of freedom is inseparable from the issue of elections. The Soviet Government has yet to express its views on this issue. The United States Government must clearly ask: Does the Soviet Government believe that the all-German government elected by free elections should be under the control of the four powers before the conclusion of the treaty, or does it agree that the all-German government should have the necessary freedom of action and the various powers of government?

(8) The United States Government notes with satisfaction that the Soviet Government now agrees in principle that free all-German elections should be held. However, such free elections can only be held if the necessary conditions exist in all parts of Germany, and if these conditions are maintained not only on and before the day of the vote, but also after the vote. Therefore, a necessary prerequisite is to ensure such conditions. In recent years, Eastern Germany has moved in a direction increasingly divergent from the main path of German development. This is why a fair investigation must be conducted before elections can be held.

(9) However, the Soviet Government does not agree to the international investigation team established by the United Nations General Assembly to conduct such an investigation throughout Germany. It rejects this investigation based on its interpretation of Article 107 of the United Nations Charter. However, this article reads: 'Nothing in the present Charter shall invalidate or preclude action, in relation to any state which during the Second World War has been an enemy of any signatory to the present Charter, taken or authorized as a result of that war by the Governments having responsibility for such action.' These words clearly do not prohibit the United Nations from considering these aspects of German affairs. This interpretation has been supported by the United Nations General Assembly through the adoption of an overwhelming majority of member states. However, even according to the Soviet Government's erroneous interpretation of the Charter, it cannot prevent the four powers from using the United Nations investigation team to determine whether the conditions for truly free elections exist throughout Germany. On the contrary, the Soviet Government suggests that the responsibility for the investigation can be entrusted to an investigation team composed of the four occupying powers. The United States Government must know what the organizational composition and powers of such an institution are before it can be confident that this suggestion can produce a fair investigation.

An investigation team composed solely of member states directly responsible for Germany would be both judge and party. The experience of the four-power control of Germany shows that such an investigation team cannot make useful decisions. Therefore, the elections would be greatly delayed. The United States Government also cannot ignore the fact that the appointment of a four-power investigation team might be seen as a step towards restoring control over Germany. This would be a retrograde action, inconsistent with the legitimate development of the Federal Republic.

For these reasons, the United States Government continues to advocate for an investigation team organized by the United Nations: such an investigation team has already been established, its powers have been defined, and it can take action immediately. Nevertheless, the United States Government remains willing to study all possibilities for determining whether free conditions exist throughout Germany for holding truly free elections. Therefore, the United States Government, after obtaining the consent of the British and French governments and consulting with the German Federal Government and the Berlin authorities, proposes the following suggestions:

1. An impartial investigation team should immediately determine whether the conditions necessary for holding free elections exist in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, as well as in the Federal Republic of Germany and the various districts of Berlin; if not, steps should be suggested to the four powers responsible in Germany to create such conditions for consideration. The four powers should provide such an investigation team with the necessary facilities to conduct investigations in the Federal Republic of Germany, the Soviet occupation zone, and the various districts of Berlin. The three Western powers and the German Federal Government have indicated their willingness to do so.

2. The four powers should use the already established United Nations investigation team for this purpose. This seems to be the quickest and most practical approach.

3. Although the United States Government is very willing to adopt the approach in the second item above, it remains willing to consider any practical and correct suggestions that the Soviet Government may wish to put forward regarding the establishment of an impartial investigation team, provided that this suggestion can promote the early holding of free elections throughout Germany.

4. Once the report of such an impartial investigation team is submitted, representatives of the four governments of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union should meet to discuss it, in order to reach an agreement on the following issues:

    A. Early holding of free all-German elections, including creating appropriate conditions where necessary; and

    B. The four powers provide guarantees that the all-German government established after free elections will have the necessary freedom of action before the treaty comes into effect."

The note presented by the Soviet government on May 24, 1952:

Regarding the note presented by the U.S. government on May 13th of this year, the Soviet government deems it necessary to state the following:

(1) Regarding the urgency of resolving the German question and the delaying tactics of the Western countries on this issue. In its note of March 10th of this year, the Soviet government suggested to the U.S., British, and French governments that they jointly discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and establishing an all-German government. In order to facilitate the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany and accelerate its preparation, the Soviet government submitted its draft peace treaty with Germany and also expressed its willingness to consider other possible suggestions on this issue. In view of the interests of consolidating peace in Europe and the need to satisfy the legitimate national demands of the German people, the Soviet government previously believed, and still believes, that it is necessary to resolve this issue without delay.

Since the U.S. government, in its reply of March 25th, suggested an investigation into the conditions for holding all-German elections in terms of establishing an all-German government, the Soviet government agreed to this suggestion in its note of April 9th, but insisted that the above-mentioned investigation should not be conducted by a United Nations investigation team—the issue of making peace with Germany does not fall under the jurisdiction of the United Nations—but by an impartial investigation team organized by the four occupying countries of Germany. At the same time, the Soviet government once again suggested to the U.S. government, as well as the British and French governments, that they immediately study the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, as well as the unification of Germany and the establishment of an all-German government. Despite the fact that the Soviet government has accepted the U.S. government's suggestion to investigate the conditions for holding free elections in Germany, and the Soviet government's suggestion that the investigation team to conduct this investigation should be appointed by agreement of the four powers to ensure the objectivity and impartiality of the investigation team, the U.S. government's note of May 13th proves that the resolution of the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany is still being delayed indefinitely once again. It is clear from the above-mentioned note that the U.S. government still refuses to start discussing these issues immediately by the four powers.

On the contrary, the U.S. government, in its note of May 13th, put forward many new preconditions that the U.S. government had not put forward in its note of March 25th; and suggested that before conducting direct negotiations, the exchange of notes should continue in order to reach an understanding on these conditions. For example, the U.S. government suggested in its note of May 13th that an understanding should be reached on the "scope of the negotiations and the fundamental issues to be studied" before starting direct negotiations, and that the exchange of notes should continue on the issue of the organizational composition and powers of the investigation team to investigate the election conditions in Germany.

All these facts prove that the U.S. government continues to delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, continues to delay the resolution of the issue of German unification and the establishment of an all-German government. This alone can explain the fact that the U.S. government, in its note of May 13th, once again raised many questions, attempting to continue the exchange of notes that has been going on for months, and is unwilling to have the four countries come together for direct negotiations in order to start jointly studying the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and all issues related to it.

In this case, it cannot but be further believed both domestically and internationally that the U.S. government does not in fact want to conclude a peace treaty with Germany and end the divided state of Germany. However, without concluding a peace treaty with Germany and without unifying Germany, it is impossible to restore an independent Germany with full rights that expresses the true will of the entire German people.

(2) Regarding the separate treaty signed by the Western countries with Germany and the attempt to avoid concluding a peace treaty with Germany, the Soviet government deems it necessary to remind you of the fact that while continuing to exchange notes, the U.S. government and the British and French governments are also conducting separate negotiations with the West German Bonn government to conclude a so-called "general" treaty. In fact, this is not a "general" treaty, but a separate peace treaty disguised as "general" in order to deceive the people. From this, it can be seen that the Potsdam Agreement, which entrusted the four countries (the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) with preparing a peace treaty with Germany, is being completely destroyed.

Although the negotiations between the three countries and the Bonn government are being conducted in secret, and the full text of the separate treaty has not yet been published, the content of the separate treaty can already be learned from the news revealed in the newspapers. From these reports, it is very clear that the above-mentioned separate treaty with West Germany prepared by the U.S., British, and French governments is by no means intended to give West Germany independence. This treaty formally abolishes the occupation regulations, but in fact preserves the military occupation regime, placing West Germany in a dependent and subordinate position to the U.S. government and the governments of Britain and France.

At the same time, the U.S., British, and French governments, taking advantage of the signing of this separate treaty with West Germany, are legitimizing the revival of the German army headed by generals of the Hitler gang, thereby paving the way for the revival of aggressive West German militarism. In fact, this treaty is an open military alliance between the U.S., Britain, and France and the West German government, and the Bonn government is using this treaty to force the German people to engage in preparations for another world war.

At the same time, the U.S., British, and French governments are trying to pull West Germany into a group of countries called the "European Defense Community"—composed of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

This self-proclaimed "European group" will become a component part of the North Atlantic Group and will establish a so-called "European army," which will include the German armed forces that are currently being revived in West Germany. It is very obvious that the purpose of establishing the "European group" and the "European army" is not only to legalize the re-militarization of West Germany that is already taking place in fact, but also to pull West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive group. It is a well-known fact that the U.S. government has recently been trying by all means to accelerate the conclusion of the above-mentioned separate treaty with West Germany and to pull West Germany into the "European group."

Therefore, the U.S. government not only wants to completely isolate one part of Germany from the other, but also wants to pit one part against the other. This means that the U.S. government is not concerned with the unification of Germany or a peace treaty with Germany, but rather wants to tie West Germany and the West German army, which is being revived, more closely to the North Atlantic Group through a new separate treaty than before, which is incompatible with the prospects for peaceful development in Europe.

All this shows that the revanchist ruling groups in West Germany are currently colluding with the North Atlantic state group. This collusion relationship can only be established under one condition, and that is that it supports the revanchist hopes of the Adenauer-Bonn government, which is currently preparing to launch a new war in Europe. The West German army, led by the fascist Hitlerite generals who are currently being revived, can only serve the aggressive purposes of German revanchists. On the other hand, West Germany's army joining the so-called "European army," which is also the North Atlantic Group army, further highlights the aggressive nature of the entire North Atlantic Group. In view of these facts, no one will believe that the composition of the "European group" and "European army" that are currently being prepared can represent "the path to peace" as stated in the U.S. note of May 13. The true meaning of the above-mentioned collusion between the North Atlantic Group and the Adenauer government can only be to further deepen the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic state group, which is now trying to directly collude with the most aggressive group in Europe—German revanchists.

Concluding the above-mentioned separate peace treaty with the West German Bonn government or the agreement on the "European group" places new obligations on West Germany, thereby increasing its dependence on the occupying countries and creating new difficulties for its unification with East Germany. East Germany is not bound by these obligations and is developing under conditions that are conducive to unifying all of Germany into a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful country. The U.S. government hopes to conclude the above-mentioned separate treaty with West Germany as soon as possible, but is dragging out the negotiations on a peace treaty and the unification of Germany, which means that it is attempting to confront the German people with a fait accompli through the above-mentioned separate treaty: the German people will face the re-militarization of West Germany and the continued stationing of occupying forces in West Germany, and obstacles that cannot be overcome at present will also be used to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty and the reunification of Germany.

However, it is impossible to announce on the one hand that a peace treaty and the unification of Germany are necessary, while on the other hand doing everything possible to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of a unified Germany. This loses all confidence in the two-sided policies of these countries and makes it necessary for the German people to seek their own path to conclude a peace treaty and restore Germany's national unity.

(3) The Soviet government's suggestions. Although there are differences of opinion on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and on the issue of unifying Germany and forming an all-German government, the Soviet government once again suggests to the U.S. government that it, together with the British government and the French government, begin discussing these issues without further delay.

Continuing to study these issues by exchanging notes cannot produce the results that can be achieved by direct negotiations, but can only make it difficult to reach an agreement. Furthermore, the delay in resolving the issue of a peace treaty and German unification cannot but cause legitimate dissatisfaction among the German people, not to mention that such a delay violates the interests of establishing normal and stable relations between Germany and its neighbors, and violates the interests of consolidating world peace.

The Soviet government is acting on the premise that in drafting a peace treaty with Germany, the Soviet government and the U.S., British, and French governments will base themselves on the decisions of the Potsdam Agreement, especially on the issue of German borders. The Soviet government has already pointed this out in its note of April 9th.

As for the all-German government and its powers, it is well known that this government must comply with the decisions of Potsdam, and that after the conclusion of the treaty, this government must promote the establishment of lasting peace in Europe in accordance with the terms of the treaty. In addition, the Soviet government continues to believe that the German people have the inalienable right to have their own national army necessary to defend their country. Without a national army, the issue of the powers of the all-German government cannot be decided fairly and properly. The Soviet government suggests that negotiations on a peace treaty with Germany and the formation of an all-German government should begin immediately, also based on the fact that separate treaties signed by any part of Germany with other governments cannot place any obligations on the all-German government, and that the all-German government that signs the treaty will enjoy all the rights enjoyed by other sovereign national governments. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent the same note to the British and French embassies.

    关于对德和约和组成全德政府问题
    苏联政府复照美英法三国政府
    严斥三国企图与西德签订单独和约阴谋
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：今年五月十三日，苏联外交部接到由美、英、法三国驻莫斯科大使馆送来的美国、英国和法国政府答复苏联政府今年四月九日关于对德和约照会的内容相同的照会。
    五月二十四日，苏联外交部把苏联政府的复文递交给美、英、法三国大使馆。
    一九五二年五月十三日美国政府的照会和一九五二年五月二十四日苏联政府的复文的全文如下：
    美国政府于一九五二年五月十三日提出的照会：
    “美利坚合众国临时代办谨向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长致意，并遵奉他的政府的命令荣幸地转达意见如下：
    （一）美国政府为答复四月九日苏联政府的照会，愿就德国的统一、选举一个自由的全德政府及与该政府缔结和约等问题表示意见如下：美国政府的政策仍旧是：在保证实现有自由的统一与有安全的和平的条件下达到这三个目标。
    （二）美国政府愿就这些问题与苏联政府开始谈判；一俟苏联政府也愿意避免进行过去那种毫无结果的谈判这一点弄明确以后，它就愿意开始谈判。因此，美国政府和英国、法国与苏联政府必须首先就谈判的范围和将要研究的基本问题取得明确的谅解。适当的准备是获得成功与避免长期拖延所必需的。四月九日的苏联政府照会对于它认为应如何保证这种谈判的成功很少提出新的见解。
    （三）苏联政府在最近的一个照会中规定德国不得加入‘任何旨在对付任何爱好和平国家的国家集团’。但是，如果德国参加了联合国，任何这一类的规定自然就没有必要了。无论如何，美国政府不能同意任何禁止德国与其他国家结成联盟的条款，不管和约的签字国之一是否可能武断地认为这个联盟是‘对付爱好和平的国家的’。作为一个自由与平等的国家，德国有与其他国家结成和平联盟的基本权利，把它的这种基本权利予以剥夺，是美国政府所不能同意的。可以假定，苏联政府同样也不能反对德国有权缔结防御协定。
    （四）美国政府在它三月二十五日的照会中指出：它正在全力支持西欧自由国家——包括德意志联邦共和国在内——的活动。这些国家正在努力成立一个和平的欧洲集团，从而开始一个国际关系不是以敌意和猜疑为基础而是以合作为基础的新纪元。美国政府欢迎成立这样一个有德国参加的欧洲集团。德国的分裂就是因为欧洲也是分裂的。这个统一欧洲的政策不会威胁到苏联的利益，也不会威胁到其政策是致力于维持和平的国家的利益。因此，美国政府将继续支持这个政策。它比以前任何时候都更为相信这个政策代表着真正的和平道路。
    （五）至于说这种合作不能扩大到它目前的范围以外一点，美国政府不能负责。美国政府仍然愿意真心诚意地研究任何目的在于缓和紧张局势及补救现存分裂现象的、切合实际的正确建议。
    （六）要缔结对德和约，必须有一个自由选举产生的、能够有充分自由参加讨论这个和约的全德政府。因此，现在要讨论对德和约的条款是不可能的。美国政府已经表明了它对于苏联政府的若干建议的意见，特别是苏联对于波茨坦协定中关于领土的条款的错误解释以及想使德国永远和西欧隔离，同时又要它设法完全用它自己的国家武装部队来保卫自己的意图。苏联的建议将意味着永远约束德国的缔结国际盟约的权利，将意味着欧洲中心永远陷于紧张与不安。
    （七）由自由选举而产生的全德政府，其本身亦必须是自由的。不论是在和约谈妥之前或谈妥之后，这种自由都是必要的。这个政府必须要能够保持它的真正代表性，能够担当作为一个重新统一的德国的政府的职责，并且在讨论和约时能够充分起它的作用。因此，这个自由问题是与选举问题不可分的。苏联政府在这个问题上仍未能表示它的意见。美国政府必须要明确问明：苏联政府是认为由自由选举所产生的全德政府在缔结和约前是要在四国控制之下呢，还是同意全德政府应当有必要的行动自由和政府的各种权力呢。
    （八）美国政府注意到苏联政府现在原则上同意应当举行全德自由选举，甚感欣慰。然而，这种自由选举只有在德国各部分都存在必要的条件，并且不仅在投票之日和投票以前保持这些条件，而且要在投票之后也保持着这些条件时，才能举行。所以，一个必要的先决步骤，就是要保证这种条件。否则，就不能获得进展。近几年来，德国东部已走向一个与德国发展的主要道路愈来愈远的方向。这就是为什么先要实行公正的调查然后始能举行选举的主要原因。
    （九）然而，苏联政府不同意联合国大会所设立的国际调查团在全德国实行这种调查。它根据它对联合国宪章第一百零七条的解释而拒绝了这种调查。然而这一条条文是这样写着的：‘本宪章并不取消或禁止负行动责任之政府对于在第二次世界大战中本宪章任何签字国之敌国因该次战争而采取或受权执行之行动。’这些话很清楚并没有禁止联合国考虑德国事务的这些方面。这种解释以极大多数会员国的通过而得到联合国大会的支持。然而，即使根据苏联政府对宪章的错误解释，也不能阻止四国利用联合国调查团来确定是否有在全德国举行真正自由选举的条件。相反地、苏联政府建议：调查的责任可以交给一个由四个占领国所组成的调查团。美国政府必须知道这样一个机构的组织成分和职权是什么以后，才能放心而认为这个建议可以产生一次公正的调查。
    一个仅由在德国负直接责任的成员国组成的调查团既将是法官又将是当事人。四国对德管制期间的经验说明，这样的调查团不能作出有用的决定。因此，选举便将大大地延迟。美国政府也不能忽视这样一个事实，即：任命四国调查团可能被认为是恢复对德管制的一个步骤。这将是一个倒退行动，不符合联邦共和国的合法发展的。
    由于这些理由，美国政府仍然主张由联合国组织调查团：这样的调查团已经成立，它的职权也已规定，它可以立即行动起来。尽管如此，美国政府仍然愿意研究一下决定全德是否存在举行真正自由选举的自由条件的一切可能性。因此，美国政府在取得英法政府同意并与德意志联邦政府及柏林当局商谈以后特提出下列建议：
    一、应由一个公正的调查团来立即决定在德国苏联占领区以及德意志联邦共和国和柏林各区是否存在举行自由选举所必须的条件；如果没有，应向在德国负责的四国建议创造这种条件的步骤，以供考虑。四国应给这样一个调查团以必要的便利，以便它在德意志联邦共和国、苏占区及柏林各区进行调查。西方三国和德意志联邦政府已经表明愿意这样做。
    二、四国为此目的应利用已经成立的联合国调查团。这似乎是最迅速的、最实际的途径。
    三、美国政府虽极愿意采取上述第二项内的办法，但它仍愿考虑苏联政府可能愿意提出的关于成立一个公正的调查团的任何切合实际的正确建议，然而有一个条件，就是：这个建议要能够促进早日在全德举行自由选举。
    四、一俟这样一个公正的调查团的报告提出之后，英、美、法、苏四国政府的代表即举行会议加以讨论，以在下列几个问题上达成协议：
    甲、早日举行全德自由选举，包括在必要创造适当条件的地方创造适当的条件；以及
    乙、四国提出保证：自由选举后成立的全德政府，在和约生效前将有必要的行动自由。”
    苏联政府于一九五二年五月二十四日提出的照会：
    关于美国政府于今年五月十三日提出的照会，苏联政府认为有必要声明如下：
    （一）关于解决德国问题的迫切性及关于西方国家在这个问题上交换照会的拖延手段。苏联政府在今年三月十日的照会中，曾向美国、英国、法国政府建议共同讨论缔结对德和约及成立全德政府问题，为了便于准备对德和约并加速准备对德和约，苏联政府曾提出它的对德和约草案，同时，又表示愿意考虑关于这个问题的其它可能的建议。鉴于巩固欧洲和平的利益，及满足德国人民合法民族要求的必要，苏联政府以前认为，现在仍然认为有必要毫不迟延地解决这个问题。
    由于美国政府在三月二十五日的复文中，在成立全德政府问题方面，建议对举行全德选举的条件进行调查，苏联政府在四月九日的照会中同意这一建议，但坚持上述调查不能由联合国——关于与德国媾和的问题并不属联合国的权限——调查团来进行，而由四个对德占领国家组织公正调查团来进行。同时苏联政府再度向美国政府以及英国和法国政府建议，立即研究对德和约以及德国的统一问题和成立全德政府的问题。尽管苏联政府已接受美国政府提出的调查在德国举行自由选举的条件的建议，以及苏联政府建议进行这种调查的调查团应由四国协议任命以保证该调查团的客观和公正，可是，美国政府五月十三日的照会证明，对德和约问题和统一德国问题的解决，仍然再度被无限期地拖延。从上述照会显然可以看出，美国政府还拒绝四国立即开始来讨论这些问题。
    相反地，美国政府在其五月十三日的照会中提出了许多新的先决条件，而这些条件是美国政府在它三月二十五日的照会中并未提出过的；并且建议在进行直接谈判之前，继续交换照会以对这些条件获致谅解。例如，美国政府在五月十三日的照会中建议，在开始直接谈判之前应就“谈判的范围和将要研究的基本问题”获致谅解，并且就调查德国选举条件的调查团的组织成分和职权问题，继续交换照会。
    所有这些事实都证明美国政府继续拖延缔结对德和约、继续拖延解决德国统一与成立全德政府问题。只要这一点就可说明下述事实，即：美国政府在它五月十三日的照会中又提出许多问题，企图继续进行已经延续数月之久的交换照会，而不愿使四国共聚一堂，进行直接谈判以便开始共同研究对德和约问题及一切与之有关的问题。
    在这种情况下，德国国内和国外就不能不更加认为：美国政府事实上并不想缔结对德和约和结束德国的分裂状态。但是，不缔结对德和约，不统一德国，就不能恢复一个有充分权利并表示整个德意志民族的真正意志的独立的德国。
    （二）关于西方国家与德国签订单独条约以及企图避免缔结对德和约一节，苏联政府认为有必要提醒你们注意下述事实：在继续交换照会的时候，美国政府和英国与法国政府同时又在和西德波恩政府进行着缔结一个关于所谓“一般性”条约的单独谈判。事实上，这并不是“一般性”条约，而是诡称为
    “一般性”以便欺骗人民的单独和约。由此可见，委托四国（美国、英国、法国和苏联）准备对德和约的波茨坦协定正在被彻底破坏。
    虽然三国与波恩政府的谈判是秘密进行的，而且单独条约的全文还没有公布，但是单独条约的内容已经可以从报纸透露的消息中获悉。从这些消息中，这一点是很明显的，即：美、英、法三国政府准备的上述对西德单独条约决不是要给西德独立。这个条约在形式上废除了占领法规，但在事实上保存了军事占领政权，使西德处于依附与从属于美国政府及英法两国政府的地位。
    同时，美、英、法三国政府利用签订这个对西德单独条约，把以希特勒匪帮将领们为首的德国军队的复活加以合法化，从而为侵略性的西德军国主义的复活铺平道路。事实上，这个条约是美、英、法三国与西德政府的公开军事同盟，波恩政府正在利用这个条约迫使德国人民从事另一次世界大战的准备。
    同时，美、英、法三国政府正力图把西德拉入名为“欧洲防御集团”的一个国家集团——由法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰及卢森堡组成。
    这个自称的“欧洲集团”将成为北大西洋集团的一个组成部分，并将建立一支所谓“欧洲军”，这支军队将包括现正在西德复活的德国武装部队。这是非常明显的，即：建立“欧洲集团”与“欧洲军”的目的，不但要使事实上早已在进行的西德重新军国主义化合法化，并且还要把西德拉入北大西洋侵略集团。这是大家知道的事：最近美国政府正在力图以各种方法加速缔结上述的对西德单独条约与把西德拉入“欧洲集团”。
    因此，美国政府不但要使德国的一部分与另一部分完全隔绝，并且还要使一部分反对另一部分。这意味着美国政府并不关心德国的统一或对德和约，而是要使西德与正在复活中的西德军队通过新的单独条约比以前更密切地与北大西洋集团联系起来，这件事是与欧洲和平发展的前景不相容的。
    这一切说明了，西德的复仇主义统治集团与北大西洋国家集团目前正在勾结起来。这种勾结关系只有在一个条件下才有可能建立，那便是它支持目前正在准备在欧洲发动新战争的阿登纳波恩政府的复仇希望。目前正在恢复中的法西斯希特勒将领率领的西德军队只能为德国复仇主义者的侵略目的服务。在另一方面，西德军队加入所谓“欧洲军”，也就是北大西洋集团军队，更突现了整个北大西洋集团的侵略本质。鉴于这些事实，没有人会相信目前在准备中的“欧洲集团”和“欧洲军”的组成能如五月十三日的美国照会所说，代表“和平道路”。上述北大西洋集团与阿登纳政府之间的勾结的真正意义不能是别的，只能是进一步加深北大西洋国家集团的侵略本质，这一集团现正力图与欧洲最具侵略性的集团——德国复仇主义者直接勾结起来。
    与西德波恩政府缔结上述的单独和约或关于“欧洲集团”的协定，使得西德承担了新的义务，因而增加了它对占领国家的依赖，并为它与东德的统一制造了新的困难。东德不受这种义务的约束，而且正在有利于统一全德成为一个统一的、独立的、民主的、和平的国家的条件下发展。美国政府希望尽速与西德缔结上述单独条约，但是对于和约及统一德国的谈判却一拖再拖，这意味着企图以上述单独条约使德国人民面临既成事实：德国人民将面临西德重新军国主义化和占领军继续驻在西德的事实，而在目前无法克服的障碍也将被利用来阻碍和约的缔结及德国的统一。
    然而，一方面宣布承认和约与德国的统一是必要的，而另一方面用尽一切办法来阻碍对德和约的缔结和恢复一个统一的德国，这是不可能的。这样就丧尽了对于这些国家的两面政策的信心，并使德国人民有必要寻求自己的途径来缔结和约并恢复德国的全国统一。
    （三）苏联政府的建议。虽然在对德和约问题上，在统一德国和组成全德政府的问题上存在着歧见，但是苏联政府再一次向美国政府建议，和英国政府及法国政府一道，开始讨论这些问题，而不要再拖延。
    如果再用交换照会的方式来继续研究这些问题，不能产生如直接谈判所能达成的结果，而只能使协议难以达成。并且和约问题和德国的统一再延不解决，不能不引起德国人民正当的不满，更不必说这种拖延是违反德国与其邻国建立正常稳固关系的利益，并且违反巩固世界和平的利益的了。
    苏联政府是根据这样一个前提而行事的：即在草拟对德和约时，苏联政府和美英法政府都将以波茨坦协定的决定为依据，特别是在德国边界问题上。苏联政府在它四月九日的照会中已经指出这一点。
    至于全德政府及其权力，大家知道，这个政府必须遵照波茨坦的决定，而在和约缔结后，这个政府依照和约条款必须促进欧洲持久和平的建立。此外，苏联政府继续认为德国人民有不可剥夺的权利以拥有保卫本国所必要的自己的国家军队、没有国家军队，就不能公正地和确当地决定全德政府的权力问题。苏联政府建议立即开始关于对德和约和组成全德政府的谈判，也是根据这一事实出发的：即德国任何一部分与其他国家政府所签订的单独条约都不能使全德政府担当任何义务，并且，签订和约的全德政府将享有其他自主国家政府所享受的一切权利。苏联外交部已将同样照会致送英国和法国大使馆。
