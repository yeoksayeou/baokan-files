Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The invading US Air Force has suffered heavy losses under the blows of the increasingly strong Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force and Air Defense Forces. The so-called "air superiority" that the American aggressors have been accustomed to boasting about has begun to waver. The fact that Major Davis, the squadron commander of the 134th Squadron of the invading US Air Force, was shot down by the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force is a clear example.

Davis was once touted by the American aggressors as the "most remarkable jet ace pilot." On February 10 this year, he was shot down in northern Korea by Zhang Jihui, a hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force. His death in battle caused serious panic and unease among the personnel of the invading US Air Force. According to foreign news agencies: Davis did not return to the team after going out on a mission, "bringing a bleak atmosphere to the American jet pilots in Korea." William, the head of the American air bandits—the commander of the US Far East Air Force, also sadly admitted in a "special statement" issued on February 13 that Davis's loss was "a major blow to the Far East Air Force" and "a tragic loss." He said in panic: "We are fighting a fierce and skilled enemy in air combat, and we need to bring out every bit of our skill, leadership, experience, and determination."

The news of Davis's death in battle also caused great shock and "fierce debate" in the United States. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on February 12, Republican leader Bridges in the US Senate used this to attack Truman's current method of waging the war of aggression against Korea. He said: The current Korean War "is the most hopeless conflict in American history." According to Agence France-Presse, Davis's wife resentfully protested to the US Air Force authorities about keeping her husband in Korea to fight and die. She said Davis had the right to be transferred from the Korean battlefield. She "condemned the Air Force authorities for violating her husband's will and not letting him go" and "quoted her husband's letter saying that he wanted to return to the United States." According to the Associated Press: She also quoted a section of Davis's letter written back home before his death in battle, which said: "Things are not as easy as they imagine. We have lost so many planes, so many people, the Communist aircraft are much better than the Sabre jets, and we have a lot more to do."

Davis's few words actually illustrate the plight of the invading US Air Force under the powerful blows of the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force and Air Defense Forces, and the wavering of its boasted so-called "air superiority;" and that Davis's death in battle was not an accidental event, but an inevitable result of the ebb and flow of enemy and ourselves. Such a change in the situation is indeed worrying the American aggressors who have always relied on indiscriminate bombing to wage war. Even the most arrogant American Air Force officials and the most reactionary American newspapers and news agencies can no longer hide their fear and unease.

As early as October 28 last year, an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo worriedly said that the growing Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force was the "most serious threat" to the so-called "superiority" of the invading US Air Force. The dispatch typically described the embarrassing situation of the US Air Force under the blows of the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force and Air Defense Forces, "suffering more and more losses in personnel and equipment." The dispatch admitted: "The bullet holes in the US F-86 Sabre jet fighters, F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters, and F-80 Shooting Star fighters are becoming more and more numerous when they return to base. An increasing number of B-29 Superfortresses are struggling to fly back to Okinawa and Japanese bases after being hit by enemy air force and ground fire, and many medium bombers are forced to make emergency landings at Allied airfields in Korea, or forced to land in the Yellow Sea, where they are rescued by Navy and Air Force rescue teams. A few never fly back."

Before and after this, US and British reactionary news agencies such as the Associated Press and United Press International sent many messages, all admitting that the growing Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force gave the invading US Air Force a serious blow. Many US Air Force officials, including US Air Force Secretary Finletter and Colonel Gabreski, known as "America's top air force ace," had to admit that the aircraft used by the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force were "excellent," and the Chinese pilots were "very good" and "skilled." American newspapers and magazines unanimously expressed concern, exclaiming that "the fact immediately became very obvious that the United Nations could no longer suffer such losses for long without seriously weakening the air force." ("New York Times" Sunday supplement, November 4, 1951)

On April 9 this year, an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul once again revealed the fear and unease of the American aggressors. The dispatch expressed unconcealable worries about the growing Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force and the "increasingly fierce and dense anti-aircraft artillery fire" of the Chinese air defense forces. The dispatch said: "The Fifth Air Force is already understaffed, and with the increasing strength of the Communist Air Force, the losses of Allied aircraft in combat have made the Allied Air Force increasingly critical." To what extent is it "critical"? The "Washington Post" on March 15 made a specific supplement. The newspaper said: "The losses suffered by our bombers are so great that the Air Force no longer announces them. The loss rate of our heavy bombers has exceeded 50%, which is a well-known fact in Korea."

Under this circumstance, many American Air Force pilots have lost their lives in vain for the Wall Street bosses who are making a fortune from the war. After Davis, Lieutenant Van Fleet Jr., son of Van Fleet, commander of the US Eighth Army, Colonel Heinz, deputy commander of the 51st Interceptor Fighter Wing of the US Air Force, and another pilot known as "Ace" Mahalin, were successively announced by the invading US Air Force authorities as "missing" or "shot down." For the arrogant and invincible American air bandits, the situation is indeed getting worse.

    在朝中人民空军和防空部队的有力打击下
    侵朝美空军损失惨重所谓“优势”发生动摇
    【新华社二十六日讯】侵朝美国空军在日益壮大的朝中人民空军和防空部队的打击下，损失惨重。美国侵略者所惯于吹嘘的所谓“空中优势”已经发生了动摇。侵朝美国空军第一百三十四中队中队长戴维斯少校被中国人民志愿军空军所击落，就是一个明显的例证。
    戴维斯曾经被美国侵略者夸称为“最了不起的喷气机王牌驾驶员”。今年二月十日，他被中国人民志愿军空军英雄张积慧击落在朝鲜北部。他的战死，在侵朝美空军人员中曾引起了严重的恐慌和不安。据外国通讯社透露：戴维斯外出执行任务没有归队，“给朝鲜的美国喷气机驾驶人员带来一片黯淡气氛”。美国空中强盗的头目——美国远东空军司令威兰在二月十三日发表的“特别声明”中也悲哀地承认：戴维斯的损失，是“对远东空军的一大打击”，“是一个悲惨的损失”。他惊惶地说：“我们是在空战中和一个厉害而熟练的敌人作战，需要我们拿出每一分的技能、领导、经验和决心。”
    戴维斯战死的消息传到美国国内，同样引起了很大的震动和“激烈的争论”。据合众社华盛顿二月十二日电，美国参议院内的共和党领袖勃里奇借此攻击杜鲁门目前进行的侵朝战争的方法。他说：现在进行的朝鲜战争，“是美国历史上最没有希望的冲突”。据法新社称，戴维斯的妻子对于美国空军当局把她的丈夫留在朝鲜作战以至战死一事怨愤地提出了抗议。她说戴维斯已有调离朝鲜战场的权利。她“斥责空军当局违反她丈夫的意志不把他放走”，并“引述她的丈夫的信说，他要回美国去”。据美联社透露：她并引述了戴维斯战死以前写回国的信中的一节，其中说：“事情并不像他们所想像的那样容易。我们损失了这么多的飞机，这么多的人，共方飞机比佩刀式机不知要好多少，我们要做的事情还很多很多。”
    戴维斯的信中的几句话实际上说明了侵朝美国空军在朝中人民空军和防空部队的有力打击下的厄运，及其吹嘘的所谓“空中优势”的正在动摇；说明了戴维斯的战死并不是一件偶然的事，而是敌我力量消长的必然结果。这样一个情势的变化，确实是使得一向依恃狂轰滥炸来进行战争的美国侵略者所感到烦恼的。甚至连最骄横的美国空军官员和最反动的美国报纸通讯社都已经无法掩盖他们的恐惧和不安了。
    早在去年十月二十八日，美联社从东京发出的一条消息就忧虑地说，正在壮大的朝中人民空军是对侵朝美空军的所谓“优势”的“最严重的威胁”。该消息典型地描写了美空军在朝中人民空军和防空部队的打击下，“在人员和装备方面损失愈来愈大”的狼狈相。消息承认：“美国的F—八十六型佩刀式喷气飞机、F—八十四型雷电式喷气飞机及F—八十型流星式飞机，在返回基地时，机身上的弹孔已愈来愈多了。日益增多的B—二十九型超空堡垒被敌方空军和地面炮火打得勉强飞回冲绳和日本基地来，有许多中型轰炸机被迫在朝鲜的盟军机场作紧急着陆，或被迫降落在黄海上，让海军和空军的救生队救起来。有少数从未飞回来。”
    在此前后，美、英反动通讯社如美联社、合众社，发出很多消息，都承认日益壮大的朝中人民空军给了侵朝美国空军以严重的打击。许多美国空军官员包括美国空军部长芬立脱和被称为“美国第一流空军健将”的加布利斯基上校在内，都不能不承认朝中人民空军所使用的飞机“精良”，朝中驾驶员“十分出色”，“技术娴熟”。美国的报纸杂志更是一致表示忧虑，惊呼“事实立刻变得很明显，联合国不能再长期地遭受这种损失而不致于严重地削弱空军力量”。（“纽约时报”一九五一年十一月四日星期增刊语）
    今年四月九日，美联社自汉城发出的一条消息，再度透露出美国侵略者的恐惧和不安。该消息对于朝中人民空军的日益壮大以及朝中防空部队的“高射炮炮火愈来愈猛烈，愈来愈稠密”，表示无可掩盖的忧虑。该消息说：“第五航空队本来就不足额，再加上共产党空军力量日渐增加，联军飞机在作战时的损失，就使得联军的空军日益处于危急地位。”倒底“危急”到什么程度呢？三月十五日的
    “华盛顿邮报”作了一个具体的补充。该报说：“我们的轰炸机所受的损失是那样大，以致空军不再予以宣布。我们的重轰炸机的损失率，已超过百分之五十，这在朝鲜已是人所共知的事实。”
    在这种情形下，许多美国空军驾驶员就白白地替大发战争财的华尔街老板送了命。在戴维斯之后，侵朝美国第八军军长范佛里特的儿子小范佛里特中尉、美空军第五十一截击战斗机联队副队长辛兹上校以及另一被称为“王牌”的飞行员马哈林，相继被侵朝美空军当局宣布为“失踪”或“被击落”。对于骄横不可一世的美国空中强盗来说，情势的确是愈来愈不妙了。
