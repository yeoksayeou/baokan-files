In the past six months, from the bizarre fire in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, which resulted in the persecution of 16,000 Chinese residents, to the forced closure of the Chinese people’s newspaper, the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," for six months and the illegal "trial" and sentencing of the newspaper's responsible person, the hostile policies adopted by the British Hong Kong government towards the Chinese people have escalated to an intolerable level. People remember that this was precisely the period of the Churchill cabinet's tenure. Churchill took office on October 25, 1951.

In the past six months, the series of persecutions and massacres of Chinese residents by the British Hong Kong government have been carried out in a planned and organized manner. The first was the Tung Tau Tsuen fire incident. This fire occurred on the afternoon of November 21 last year. The sudden fire burned for more than four hours, affecting an area of four square kilometers, with more than 3,000 affected households and more than 16,000 affected people. The fire started in a small textile factory. The two brothers who ran the factory, one managing the factory and the other working in the British Hong Kong government, suddenly moved away two days before the fire. During the fire, the British Hong Kong authorities not only did not actively fight the fire, but instead prevented residents from fighting the fire, and even condoned organized bandits taking advantage of the fire to loot. Afterwards, they did not investigate the cause of the fire, and also obstructed social figures from helping the victims. Two days later, the British Hong Kong government issued a notice prohibiting the victims from rebuilding houses in Tung Tau Tsuen. Peng De, an official of the British Hong Kong government, also explained that Tung Tau Tsuen had long been designated for "clearance." Prior to this, the British Hong Kong government had announced that it would expand the area of Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon and force all residents of Tung Tau Tsuen to relocate. These facts powerfully illustrate that this bizarre fire was planned and organized by the British Hong Kong government. In order to resolutely realize this barbaric and cruel conspiracy, the British Hong Kong government later dispatched armored vehicles and armed police on December 31 last year to forcibly demolish the houses that the victims had painstakingly rebuilt in Tung Tau Tsuen, injuring and arresting three victims; on January 9, the British Hong Kong government again dispatched thousands of soldiers and police, 35 military vehicles and armored vehicles, and surrounded the unarmed and starving Tung Tau Tsuen victims. Twenty or thirty machine guns were distributed on each passage. After the British military police were deployed, they entered the disaster area, demolished the offices of the victims' representatives, and robbed the clothing given to the victims by people from all walks of life. From January 10 to 16, the British Hong Kong government unreasonably arrested and deported Li Wenxing, a representative of the victims, and Xian Peiling, director of the Kowloon City branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry General Union, and Yao Jian, the secretary, who supported the victims' demands. The tragic persecution of more than 16,000 residents of Tung Tau Tsuen aroused angry protests from the people of China and enthusiastic relief and support for the affected compatriots. In addition to donating money and food, people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City organized delegations to go to Kowloon to express condolences to the affected compatriots. The condolence delegation stated that they would go to the scene of the incident to find out the truth and make it public. However, in order to cover up its unspeakable cruel conspiracy, the British Hong Kong government unreasonably refused the condolence delegation entry.

On January 10 and 14, the British Hong Kong government also arbitrarily and unreasonably arrested ten of our country's film artists, including Sima Wensen, and deported them. This incident was the beginning of another planned and organized conspiracy to persecute Chinese residents. The British Hong Kong government conspired to arrest a large number of patriotic Chinese people and deported them for the same "unnecessary" "reason". This shameless conspiracy was temporarily shelved under the resolute anti-persecution struggle of Chinese residents in Hong Kong. But another incident that occurred soon after more clearly exposed the hideous face of the British Hong Kong authorities. This incident was the bloody atrocity of massacring Chinese people on March 1.

On March 1, while unreasonably refusing entry to my "Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Organizations Condolence Delegation to Kowloon Tung Tau Tsuen Disaster-stricken Compatriots", the British Hong Kong government dispatched a large number of police, using police cars, tear gas, and even opening fire, to carry out a planned and organized arrest and killing of my patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. Many of our compatriots were injured, three were shot and wounded, and textile worker Chen Dayi died tragically due to his injuries. More than 100 of our compatriots were arrested on the spot, including three teenagers aged twelve to fifteen, 24 of whom were illegally tried and 18 illegally sentenced. This bloody atrocity was the second committed by British imperialists in Hong Kong after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The previous one was the Russell Street blood case, which occurred on January 30, 1950. According to a statement issued by British Colonial Secretary Lyttelton, the cause of the March 1 incident was due to the impact of rumors that "the condolence delegation had been blocked at the border," but the one who spread this rumor was none other than Murray, the head of the British Hong Kong government's Information Services Department. After the bloody incident occurred, the London radio station barked like a mad dog, describing their massacre as a "riot" by Chinese residents, and the British Hong Kong government also mobilized reactionary Chinese and English newspapers to create rumors, attempting to use this as an excuse to implement its conspiracy to further persecute my patriotic compatriots. Subsequently, the British Hong Kong government continuously carried out illegal searches and arrests of Chinese residents on the streets, in restaurants, and in private residences. On March 20 and 21, the British Hong Kong government arrested and charged ten responsible persons of the Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post with the "crime" of "publishing seditious texts". On April 25, ten union leaders and workers were arrested and deported. On April 30, another 2,000 wooden houses in Kowloon Tsai were burned down. After fifteen days of illegal trial, the British Hong Kong government forced the Ta Kung Pao to suspend publication for half a year on May 5, and sentenced Fei Yimin, the printer of the Ta Kung Pao, and Li Zongying, the editor, to harsh punishments. At the same time, the brutal arrests and deportations of union leaders and workers were being intensified. On May 2, 5, and 6, the British Hong Kong government unreasonably arrested and deported eighteen union leaders, workers, and students.

As everyone knows, since Churchill took office, British imperialism has promulgated a series of laws in Hong Kong to strengthen its reign of terror over the Chinese people:

On November 9, 1951, the British Hong Kong government promulgated a special decree, putting the "Emergency Ordinance No. 99 of 1949" into effect. This ordinance stipulates that the Hong Kong police can directly search houses, vehicles, ships, or aircraft, as well as anyone entering and leaving there, and can arbitrarily confiscate items, goods, documents, etc.

On December 5 of the same year, the British Hong Kong government amended the "Public Order Ordinance" to grant the military the power to arrest residents, and also announced the addition of fifty "restricted areas" and seventy-four "protected areas." This is a hostile military measure against China.

On December 7 of the same year, the British Hong Kong government announced that it would extend the validity period of the "Illegal Strike and Factory Closure Ordinance," which suppresses workers, to the end of 1952, and on the same day announced the extension of the implementation period of the "Societies Ordinance" in order to continue to "ban" people's organizations it considers "bad."

On January 8 this year, the British Hong Kong government made a "supplement" to the "Societies Ordinance," expanding the scope of control from organizations with more than ten members to "organizations with any number of members."

In addition to the original "Control of Publications Consolidation Ordinance", "Public Entertainment Places Ordinance"... these "ordinances" constitute a fascist code used to deprive Chinese residents of all legitimate rights and interests, the first of which is to suppress the patriotic activities of Chinese residents.

As is well known, the British imperialists' various acts of persecution in Hong Kong, with the main goal of suppressing the patriotic activities of Chinese residents, are a step in their attempt, under the direction of US imperialism, to turn Hong Kong into a forward base for aggression against China.

US imperialists attach great importance to Hong Kong's position in their Far East aggression plan. US Secretary of State Acheson once said that many "important tasks" could be carried out from Hong Kong to China, and that if "Hong Kong is lost," it would have "a very unfavorable impact on the interests of the United Nations in the Far East." Former US Secretary of Defense Marshall also stated that "Hong Kong is also included in the Western countries' defense system." In May 1951, senior military representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held a secret meeting in Singapore, during which they studied the issue of using Hong Kong as a military base in a broad strategic plan.

British imperialists have been tacitly allowing, supporting, and cooperating with the various criminal activities of US aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in Hong Kong. The Churchill government is even more slavishly implementing US imperialist policies and intensifying its efforts to turn Hong Kong into a base for US imperialist aggression against China. Britain in Hong Kong harbors and encourages small groups of remnants of the Chiang gang, who frequently invade our territory to harass residents and carry out various sabotage activities. Recently, US officers have also led Japanese military experts and Kuomintang bandit gang personnel to Hong Kong to conduct terrain surveys and study the terrain of the areas where Britain intends to build airports and barracks. Recently, provocative incidents by British military police in the Kowloon border area have also been increasing. On March 4, British police unreasonably arrested seven Chinese farmers, including Lin Li, who went to Kowloon to farm, and subjected them to severe torture. British Hong Kong police have consistently subjected Chinese travelers to brutal beatings and intentional delays at Luohu and Man Kam To. In the past two years, a total of eighty-eight serious incidents have occurred, including two incidents of shooting at travelers, in which four of our compatriots were shot and wounded, and two others were pushed into the river and drowned. Recently, British police have more frequently and intentionally crossed into our territory to provoke our border guards. Such incidents occurred twelve times in the period from February 3 to 9 alone.

In the past six months, the British imperialists, under the direction of US imperialism, have become increasingly rampant in their open provocative behavior towards the Chinese people! The British government must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising from these atrocities.

    不可容忍的挑衅行为
    新华社记者  黄文俞
    半年来，从九龙城东头村发生离奇火灾、一万六千个中国居民被迫害，直到迫令中国人民的报纸香港“大公报”停刊六个月和该报负责人被非法“审讯”、判刑，香港英国政府对中国人民所采取的敌对政策已发展到不可容忍的程度了。人们记得，这恰恰是邱吉尔内阁任内的半年。邱吉尔是在一九五一年十月二十五日登台的。
    半年来，香港英国政府对中国居民的一连串迫害和屠杀行为，都是有计划、有布置地进行的。首先是东头村大火事件。这场大火发生在去年十一月二十一日下午。这个突如其来的大火燃烧了四个多钟头，受灾面积达四平方公里，受灾户数三千多，受灾人口达一万六千多人。起火的地点是在一家小纺织厂中，这个小纺织厂的两兄弟，一个主持纺织厂，一个在香港英国政府机关内工作，发生火灾前两天，他们突然搬走了。在大火燃烧的过程中，香港英国当局不但不积极救火，相反地并阻拦居民去救火，而且纵容有组织的匪徒趁火打劫。事后他们不调查起火原因，并且还阻挠社会人士对灾民的救助。隔了两天，香港英国政府即发表通告，不准灾民在东头村重建房屋。香港英国政府的官员彭德还解释说：东头村是早已被划入要“清除”之列的。在此之前，香港英国政府曾宣布要在九龙扩大启德机场的面积，并迫令东头村的全部居民迁徙。这些事实有力地说明了：这一场离奇的大火，是香港英国政府有计划、有布置地一手制造出来的。为要坚决实现其野蛮残忍的这个阴谋，香港英国政府后来又在去年十二月三十一日出动冲锋车和武装警察强行拆毁灾民辛辛苦苦在东头村重建起来的房屋，殴伤并逮捕了灾民三人；在一月九日，香港英国政府再次出动了上千军警、三十五辆军车和装甲车，把手无寸铁、饥寒交迫的东头村灾民团团包围起来，二、三十挺机关枪分布在每条通道上。英国军警在部署停当后，就进入灾区，拆毁灾民代表的办事处，并抢走各界人民送给灾民的衣物。一月十日至十六日，香港英国政府又先后把灾民代表李文兴和支援灾民要求的港九纺织染业总工会九龙城支会主任冼佩玲、书记姚坚等无理逮捕并驱逐出境。东头村一万六千多居民的惨被迫害，引起了全中国人民的愤怒抗议和对受灾同胞的热烈救助和支援。广东省、广州市各人民团体除捐款捐粮外，并组织代表团准备前赴九龙慰问受灾同胞。慰问团表示，要前赴出事地点，查明真相，公诸于世。但是，香港英国政府为了掩盖其不可告人的残忍阴谋，无理拒绝慰问团入境。
    一月十日及十四日，香港英国政府又横蛮无理地逮捕了我国电影艺术工作者司马文森等十人，并将他们驱逐出境。这一事件，是又一个有计划、有布置的迫害中国居民的阴谋的开始。香港英国政府阴谋逮捕一大批中国爱国人民，同样以“不需要”为“理由”，把他们驱逐出境。这一无耻的阴谋，在香港中国居民进行坚决的反迫害斗争下，曾被迫暂时搁置起来。但不久之后发生的另一事件，更清楚地暴露出香港英国当局的狰狞面目。这个事件，就是三月一日屠杀中国人民的血腥暴行。
    三月一日，香港英国政府一面无理拒绝我“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙东头村受灾同胞代表团”前赴九龙，一面又出动了大批警察，用警车、催泪弹以至开枪射击，对我香港爱国同胞进行有计划、有布置的捕杀。我国同胞多人被打伤，三人中弹受伤，其中纺织工人陈达仪且因伤重惨死。我国同胞当场被捕的达一百多人，包括三个十二岁到十五岁的少年，其中有二十四人被非法审讯，十八人被非法判刑。这个血腥暴行已是中华人民共和国成立后，英帝国主义者在香港制造的第二次。前一次是罗素街血案，发生在一九五○年一月三十日。据英国殖民大臣里特尔顿发表的声明，三月一日事件的起因，是由于“慰问团已被阻于边境”的谣言影响，可是散播这个谣言的不是别人，正是香港英国政府的新闻处处长穆磊。血案发生后，伦敦广播电台疯狗似地狂吠，把他们的屠杀暴行说成中国居民实行“暴动”，香港英国政府也动员了反动的中英文报纸来制造谣言，企图以此为藉口，实施其进一步迫害我爱国同胞的阴谋。接着，香港英国政府就不断地在街道上，在餐室里，在私人住宅里，非法搜捕中国居民了。三月二十日、二十一日以“刊载煽动性文字”的“罪名”，逮捕了并控告大公报、文汇报、新晚报的十个负责人。四月二十五日，又把十个工会领袖和工人逮捕并驱逐出境。四月三十日九龙仔又有木屋二千间烧毁。经过十五天的非法审讯后，香港英国政府在五月五日迫令大公报停刊半年，并将大公报督印人费彝民、编辑李宗瀛分别判处苛刻的刑罚。与此同时，横蛮的逮捕和驱逐工会领袖和工人的暴行，正在加紧进行着，在五月二日、五日、六日，香港英国政府又先后把十八个工会领袖、工人和学生无理逮捕并驱逐出境。
    大家知道，自邱吉尔登台后，英帝国主义在香港曾颁布过一连串法令，加强对中国人民的恐怖统治：
    一九五一年十一月九日，香港英国政府公布一项特别法令，把“一九四九年第九十九号紧急条例”付诸实施。这个条例规定香港的警察可以迳行搜查屋宇、车辆、船舶或飞机，以及进出那里的任何人，并可以任意没收物件、货物、文件等。
    同年十二月五日，香港英国政府修正了“公共秩序条例”给予军队以逮捕居民的权力，同时还宣布增加了五十个“禁区”和七十四个“保卫地区”。这是对中国采取敌视的军事措施。
    同年十二月七日，香港英国政府宣布将镇压工人的“非法罢工与闭厂条例”，延长有效期限到一九五二年年底，同日又宣布了延长“社团条例”的实施期限，以继续“取缔”它认为“不良”的人民团体。
    今年一月八日，香港英国政府对“社团条例”作了“补充”，把管制范围由原来规定的十人以上的团体扩大为“不论任何数目会员的组织”。
    加上原来的“管制出版物合并条例”、“公共娱乐场所条例”……这些“条例”，就构成了一部法西斯法典，用来剥夺中国居民的一切正当权益，其中首先就是压制中国居民的爱国活动。
    如所周知，英帝国主义者在香港进行以压制中国居民的爱国活动为主要目标的种种迫害暴行，是他们在美帝国主义指使下，企图把香港变成侵略中国的前哨基地的一个步骤。
    美帝国主义者很重视香港在其远东侵略计划中的地位。美国国务卿艾奇逊曾说过从香港可以向中国进行许多“重要工作”，如果“失掉香港”，“对于联合国在远东的利益有很不利的影响”。美国前国防部长马歇尔也曾表示，“香港也包括在西方国家防御体系之内”。一九五一年五月间，英、美、法三国高级军事代表在新加坡举行秘密会议时，就曾研究了利用香港做广泛战略计划中的军事基地问题。
    英帝国主义者一直在默许、支持和配合美国侵略者及其走狗蒋匪帮在香港的种种罪恶活动，邱吉尔政府则更加奴颜婢膝地执行美帝国主义的政策，加紧使香港变为美帝国主义侵略中国的基地。英国在香港包庇和怂恿小股蒋帮残匪，时常侵入我境骚扰居民，进行种种破坏活动。最近美国军官还带领了日本军事专家和国民党匪帮人员到香港进行地形调查，并且研究英国打算建筑飞机场和兵营的那些地区的地形。最近以来，英国军警在九龙边境地区的挑衅事件也越来越多。英方警察在三月四日无理逮捕了前往九龙耕作的中国农民林礼几等七人，并加以严刑拷打。香港英国警察在罗湖与文锦渡，对中国旅客一贯实行凶残的殴辱和故意留难，两年来发生严重事件共八十八宗，其中有两次开枪向旅客射击，我国同胞四人中弹受伤，另有两人被推入河中溺毙。最近英警更经常有意越入我境，向我方警卫战士寻衅。此类事件，仅二月三日至九日内即发生十二次。
    近半年来，英帝国主义者在美帝国主义的指使下，对中国人民的公开挑衅行为越来越猖狂了！英国政府就必须承担这些暴行所引起的一切严重后果的全部责任。
