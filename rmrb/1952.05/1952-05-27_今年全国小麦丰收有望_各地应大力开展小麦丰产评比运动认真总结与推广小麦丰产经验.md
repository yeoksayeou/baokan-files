    【Report from this newspaper】This year's wheat production, with the exception of most areas of the Southwest and parts of Fujian Province, which may have reduced production due to drought, flooding, pests, and other disasters, wheat production in most other areas of the country is estimated to have increased compared to last year. Currently, in major wheat-producing areas such as Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong, Shaanxi, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, wheat is generally growing well and may increase by about 10% compared to last year.
    This year, various areas in East China have generally attached importance to weeding, draining, and fertilizing wheat fields. With the exception of some areas of Fujian Province, which have reduced production due to disasters and can only harvest an average of 50%, wheat yields in other areas may increase by about 10% compared to last year. Wheat growth in Zhejiang is the best, and a bumper harvest is expected. Except for individual areas in the Central South region that have suffered from frost, flooding, and insect disasters, resulting in poor harvests, wheat is generally growing well, and the total output of the region may exceed last year. This year, North China generally paid attention to conserving soil moisture and cultivating wheat fields, and the amount of fertilizer applied also increased compared to last year. Although some areas of the three major wheat-producing provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Pingyuan experienced pests and diseases, they were not disastrous due to vigorous prevention and control. Currently, wheat is growing well, and the estimated yield can be increased compared to last year. In some areas of Pingyuan Province, wheat is growing vigorously this year, which has not been seen in the past few decades. Due to drought last winter and severe cold this spring in the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, winter wheat is generally growing poorly, but spring wheat was sown in a timely manner and is emerging well, and the estimated yield will still exceed last year. In the Northwest region, the provinces' wheat fields are cultivated meticulously, and with timely rainfall, winter wheat is generally growing well. Most areas of the Southwest region suffered from severe spring droughts, and wheat harvests were not as good as last year, but due to a slight expansion of the sown area, the total output may not be lower than last year. This spring, the Northeast region has abundant rainfall, and sowing was timely. Currently, spring wheat seedlings are emerging neatly. If there are no serious disasters in the future, it is estimated that completing the production increase plan will not be a problem.
    This year, the wheat production increase work in various regions of the country has already achieved results. If there are no major disasters in the future, a bumper harvest is expected. Now that the wheat harvest is approaching, all areas should vigorously develop wheat bumper harvest competition activities, seriously summarize and promote wheat bumper harvest experiences, and lay the foundation for future wheat production increases.

    今年全国小麦丰收有望
    各地应大力开展小麦丰产评比运动认真总结与推广小麦丰产经验
    【本报讯】今年小麦生产，除西南大部地区和福建省部分地区因旱、涝、病虫等灾害可能减产外，全国其他大部地区的小麦产量估计较去年都有增加。目前，主要麦产区如山西、河北、平原、山东、陕西、苏北、皖北等地，小麦普遍生长良好，可较去年增收一成左右。
    华东区各地今年对麦田锄麦、排水、施肥等工作，普遍重视。小麦产量除福建省部分地区因灾减收，平均只能收五成外，其他地区可较去年增产一成左右。浙江小麦生长最好，可望丰收。中南区各省除个别地区遭受冻、涝、虫等灾害，收成较差外，小麦一般生长良好，全区总产量可超过去年。华北区今年普遍注意麦田保墒耕锄工作，追肥数量也较去年增加。主要麦产区如山西、河北、平原三省的部分地区虽发生病虫害，但经大力防治，未致成灾。目前小麦生长良好，估计产量都可较去年增加。平原省有些地区，今年小麦生长旺盛，为过去数十年来所未见。察哈尔、绥远两省因去冬干旱、今春严寒，冬小麦普遍生长不良，但春麦播种及时，出苗良好，估计产量仍将超过去年。西北区各省麦田耕作精细，加以雨水及时，冬麦生长普遍良好。西南区大部地区春旱严重，小麦收成不如去年，但因播种面积稍有扩大，总产量或不低于去年。东北区今春雨水充沛，播种适时，目前春麦出苗整齐，今后如无严重灾害，估计完成增产计划不成问题。
    今年全国各地区小麦增产工作已有成绩，今后如无大的灾害，丰收有望。现在麦收即届，各地应大力开展小麦丰产评比运动，认真总结与推广小麦丰产经验，为今后小麦增产打下基础。
