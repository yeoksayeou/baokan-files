    The CPC Leoting County Committee Should Pay Attention to Salt Production
    Comrade Editor: I work at the Daqinghe Management Office of the Changlu Salt Affairs Bureau. Our office is located on the coast of the Third District of Leoting County. In the past, the CPC Leoting County Committee's leadership over salt production was very insufficient. After we raised our opinions several times, there were some changes. However, since the "Three-Anti" Movement began, the leadership transferred many cadres from our office to fight "tigers," leaving comrades who were unfamiliar with the business to maintain the work. Although everyone overcame difficulties and worked hard to produce, they could not meet the production requirements due to unfamiliarity with the business. We have requested the County Committee three times to send more cadres to lead production as much as possible, but this matter has not been resolved. We also know that the work of the County Committee leaders is very heavy, but neglecting salt production is equally unacceptable, because if we do not seize the opportunity during the spring drying season, we will not be able to complete the production tasks. Therefore, we suggest that the leading organs of Leoting County pay attention to this issue, appropriately allocate manpower, arrange work, and pay attention to the leadership of salt production.

    中共乐亭县委应重视盐业生产
    编辑同志：我在长芦盐务管理局大清河管理处工作。我处设在乐亭县三区海岸。过去中共乐亭县委对盐业生产的领导很不够，经过我们几次提意见，才有了一些改变。但自“三反”运动开始后，领导方面从我处调出很多干部去打“虎”，留下不熟悉业务的同志维持工作。大家虽然克服困难，努力生产，但由于业务生疏，总达不到生产要求。我们曾三次要求县委尽可能多派一些干部来领导生产，但这件事始终没有得到解决。我们也知道县委领导的工作很繁重，但忽视盐业生产也是同样不行的，因为在春晒季节不抓紧，就完不成生产任务。因此，我们建议乐亭县的领导机关注意这个问题，适当地配备力量，安排工作，重视对盐业生产的领导。
