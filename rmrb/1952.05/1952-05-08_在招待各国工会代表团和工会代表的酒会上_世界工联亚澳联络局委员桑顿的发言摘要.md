(Xinhua News Agency, 7th) The following is a summary of the speech given by Thornton, Member of the Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, at a reception held in Beijing on the 6th by the Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau in honor of trade union delegations and representatives from various countries who came to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations:

    Thornton began by saying: The Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions welcomes you all to attend this joyful gathering. We hope you will make yourselves at home and spend this friendly time together. Thanks to the hospitality of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we have the opportunity today to meet brothers from so many countries in an atmosphere of friendly internationalism.

    Thornton continued: In November 1949, a truly historic meeting was held in Beijing, namely the Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference. This conference was initiated and convened by trade unions from many countries in Asia. The reason this conference could be held in an environment free from government and police interference was because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese working class, had achieved victory. The Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference discussed the specific problems of Asian and Australasian workers. The resolutions of the conference had a tremendous impact on workers in Asia and Australasia. The Asian and Australasian Trade Union Conference also decided to establish a permanent organization of the World Federation of Trade Unions, namely the Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to make contact with trade unions in Asian and Australian countries and to assist them in their central task of improving the labor conditions and living standards of the working class.

    Thornton said: We all know from our own painful experience that it takes arduous and long-term struggles to improve the living standards of the working people. In the struggle, workers must overcome many difficulties, and in the struggle, workers will often suffer setbacks in their efforts to win normal trade union working conditions. For example, our brothers in Korea, Malaya, and Vietnam can attest to this. Countries suffering from imperialist aggression are suffering from terrible bombing, germ warfare, and the large-scale destruction of life, buildings, and food. It is very difficult to improve living standards in these countries.

    Therefore, in order for trade union activities to improve workers' lives to be successful, it is necessary to establish and maintain peace in Asia and the world.

    Secondly, we also have the clear example of China. We see that only by driving out imperialism and defeating their domestic agents, the feudal landlord class and the comprador bourgeoisie, can the lives of workers be truly improved. If the triple exploitation of foreign imperialism and domestic feudal landlords and comprador capital still exists, it is impossible to improve the living conditions of workers.

    We can see that trade unions can only engage in normal activities when colonial and semi-colonial countries are liberated from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and its lackeys. Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions takes a firm stand and unhesitatingly supports the national liberation struggles of the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

    Thirdly, in order to make full use of the power of international solidarity to help each other, we must have the freedom to meet each other, exchange opinions and experiences.

    Thornton added: We had hoped to see representatives from Pakistan and Japan here. The workers of these two countries warmly welcomed the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to send representatives to participate in the May Day celebration in Beijing. However, the governments of Pakistan and Japan refused to issue passports to these elected representatives, thus depriving us of the opportunity to welcome the workers' representatives of these two countries.

    Thornton pointed out: Not only that, but now the Yoshida government in Japan is trying to pass a law that deprives trade unions of all freedom. All trade unions in Japan are fiercely opposing this law, and such reactionary measures have already been or are being adopted in some countries. Therefore, we believe that it is our task to assist trade unions in Asian and Australasian countries in their struggle for trade union rights, for freedom of assembly, and for freedom of communication between trade unions of various countries.

    Thornton concluded by saying: The Asian-Australasian Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions is very happy to have this opportunity to meet you all, and we hope that this will be the beginning of close and continuous cooperation between us. We believe that unified action can make the improvement of workers' living and working conditions a reality and is urgently needed. We are convinced that we will not allow anything to hinder the development of this unified action.

    Long live the working class of Asia and Australia!
    Long live the solidarity of the proletarians of the world!

    在招待各国工会代表团和工会代表的酒会上
    世界工联亚澳联络局委员桑顿的发言摘要
    【新华社七日讯】世界工会联合会亚澳联络局委员桑顿，在六日亚澳联络局在北京招待来中国参加“五一”节观礼的各国工会代表团和工会代表的酒会上的发言摘要如下：
    桑顿首先说：世界工会联合会亚澳联络局欢迎诸位来参加这个欢乐的聚会，希望大家不要客气，让我们在一起共同度过这个友好的时光。由于中华全国总工会的好客，使我们今天有机会能在友好的国际主义精神的气氛中和这样许多国家的兄弟们会面。
    桑顿接着说    ：一九四九年十一月在北京召开了一个真正有历史意义的会议，这就是亚澳工会会议。这个会议是由亚洲许多国家的工会发起召开的。这个会议所以能够在一个不受政府及警察干涉的环境下召开，是因为中国人民在中国工人阶级的领导下取得了胜利。亚澳工会会议讨论了亚澳工人的特殊问题。会议的决议在亚澳工人中发生了巨大的效果。亚澳工会会议同时也决定要建立一个世界工联的永久性组织，这就是世界工联亚澳联络局，要它来和亚洲澳洲各国的工会取得联系，对于他们的中心任务，即提高工人阶级的劳动条件及生活水平，给予帮助。
    桑顿说：我们大家从自己的痛苦的经验里，都知道只有经过艰苦的长期的斗争才能提高劳动人民的生活水平。在斗争中工人必须克服许多困难，在斗争中工人也会因为争取正常的工会工作条件而经常受到挫折。例如我们的朝鲜，马来亚，及越南兄弟们就可以证明这一点。受帝国主义侵略的国家，遭受着可怕的轰炸，细菌战，生命、建筑物、粮食遭到大量毁坏。在这些国家里是很难提高生活水平的。
    因此要使改善工人生活的工会活动得到胜利，必须建立和保持亚洲与世界和平。
    其次我们也有中国的鲜明例子，我们看到只有把帝国主义赶出去，把他们在国内的代理人封建地主阶级和买办资产阶级打垮后，才能真正地改善工人的生活。如果外国的帝国主义和国内的封建地主与买办资本的三重剥削还存在，进行改善工人生活条件是不可能的。
    我们可以看到工会能够获得正常的活动，只有使殖民地和半殖民地国家从帝国主义及其走狗的压迫和剥削下解放出来。所以世界工会联合会站稳立场毫不犹豫地支持殖民地及半殖民地国家中人民的民族解放斗争。
    再其次，为了要使我们充分地利用国际团结的力量来达到互相帮助，我们须要有互相见面交换意见和经验的自由。
    桑顿又说：我们希望能在这里见到巴基斯坦和日本的代表。这两国的工人非常热烈地欢迎中华全国总工会的邀请，要派代表来参加在北京举行的庆祝“五一”劳动节大会。但是巴基斯坦和日本政府却拒绝发护照给这些当选的代表们，因此就剥夺了我们欢迎这两国的工人代表的机会。
    桑顿指出：不仅如此，现在日本吉田政府正企图通过一个剥夺工会一切自由的法律，日本的一切工会正在激烈地反对这个法律，而这种反动的措施在某些国家里已经或正在被采纳着。因此我们认为协助亚澳各国工会争取工会权利，争取集会自由及各国工会间交往自由的斗争，是我们的任务。
    桑顿最后说：世界工联亚澳联络局很高兴能有这样的机会和大家见面，我们希望这将是我们之间紧密的不断合作的开端。我们认为统一行动可以使工人的生活和工作条件的改善得以实现而且是迫切需要的。我们深信我们决不允许任何东西阻碍我们这种统一行动的发展。
    亚洲澳洲工人阶级万岁！
    全世界无产阶级团结万岁！
