    Striving for Peace in the Asian and Pacific Region

    The US imperialists are frantically pursuing a policy of war, seriously threatening world peace and the peace and security of the Asian and Pacific region. Therefore, safeguarding peace in the Asian and Pacific region has become an important part of safeguarding world peace, and it is the most urgent demand of all peace-loving people, especially the people of the Asian and Pacific region. After Song Qingling, Guo Moruo and nine other well-known figures in China's peace movement, representing the will of the Chinese people, jointly invited prominent peace-loving figures from Asian and Pacific countries on March 21st to jointly initiate the "Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference", they quickly received enthusiastic responses from peace-loving people in Asian and Pacific coastal countries. As of May 15th, peace advocates from twenty countries, including Australia, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Burma, Indonesia, Colombia, Korea, India, Chile, Mexico, El Salvador, Ceylon, Canada, Pakistan, the United States, Japan, Vietnam, Laos, and the Soviet Union, have unanimously expressed their support for holding this conference in Beijing, the capital of China. Various countries have established preparatory committees to participate in the Peace Conference and are actively selecting representatives to attend the preparatory meeting to be held in Beijing soon. This fully demonstrates the fervent desire of the people of the Asian and Pacific region for peace and their firm determination to defend peace.

    The reason why the people of Asian and Pacific countries so enthusiastically support the convening of the Peace Conference is that the terrifying shadow of the United States' active preparations for expanding the war of aggression is seriously threatening the independence and freedom of their countries. At present, the US imperialists' sinful activities of establishing military bases everywhere in the Asian and Pacific region and everywhere searching for cannon fodder and war resources have seriously harmed the lives of the people of these countries. They know that the struggle to defend peace in the Asian and Pacific region is also a struggle to win their national independence and improve the lives of their people. The initiation of the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference points out the path for the people of this region to unite and strive for peace together, and therefore this conference has won the enthusiastic support and active participation of the people of various countries.

    Defeat the New Conspiracy of the United States to Sabotage the Korean Negotiations

    Recently, the American aggressors are carrying out a new conspiracy to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. The US side's negotiating representatives are adopting an unreasonable and unreasonable attitude of non-consultation at the negotiation meetings, and continue to adhere to their absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation"; at the same time, US aircraft attacked our delegation's vehicles on May 12, killing members of our delegation, and invaded the Kaesong Neutral Zone on May 14 to conduct strafing, continuously violating the agreement and creating provocative incidents. The purpose of the new conspiracy of the American aggressors is still to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, continue to delay and sabotage the Korean negotiations, and create international tension.

    At the plenary session of the negotiating delegations, the US negotiating representatives continued to repeat the absurd claims of so-called "open and jointly confirmed POW screening" and so-called "fair confirmation of the POW screening process," and shamelessly publicized the lies of "humane treatment" and "respect for the POWs' natural rights" in order to defend their sinful plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel. These shameless lies that distort right and wrong by the American aggressors have not only been solemnly refuted again and again by our Chief Representative General Nam Il, but have also been exposed by more and more irrefutable facts. Recently, the heroic struggle of our captured personnel on Geoje Island to fight for reasonable treatment and the right to return to their motherland has completely bankrupted the conspiracy of the American aggressors.

    The Chinese People's Volunteers captured personnel in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps on Koje Island, in the face of the US aggressors using violence to force the so-called "screening" in intolerable circumstances, once detained the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp leader Dodd and made four reasonable and just demands to the U.S. side: requiring the U.S. side to immediately stop barbaric acts, stop insults, torture, forced blood-written letters, massacres, and the use of prisoners of war as experimental subjects for poison gas and bacterial weapons and atomic bombs, ensure that prisoners of war enjoy the human rights and personal lives stipulated by international law; immediately stop the illegal so-called "voluntary repatriation" of our captured personnel; stop forced "screening" and rearm prisoners of war. The demands of our captured personnel fully exposed the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. Because this atrocity has reached the point where it cannot be concealed, Kerrson, the head of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, in his reply to the demands of our captured personnel, had to "positively acknowledge that there have been bloody incidents, as a result of which many prisoners of war were killed or injured by United Nations forces," and guaranteed that in the future, "prisoners of war can expect humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law," that "violent actions and bloody incidents will no longer occur," and that "there will be no more forced screening or any rearming actions." Kerrson's reply is the bloody confession of the American aggressors' violation of international law and the massacre and persecution of our captured personnel. The irrefutable facts reflected in the demands of our captured personnel and Kerrson's reply have completely exposed to the people of the world the sinister conspiracy of the American aggressors to forcibly detain our captured personnel as cannon fodder.

    In the face of these ironclad facts, the American aggressors not only have no remorse, but instead, betray their promises and overturn the promises made by Kerrson to our captured personnel, vainly attempting to wash away their bloody crimes that can never be washed away. General Clark, the new commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces invading Korea, issued a statement on May 15 in accordance with the orders of the U.S. Department of the Army, shamelessly denying that the promises made by Kerrson "have no effect whatsoever." The U.S. Department of Defense also issued a statement on May 13, attempting to overturn the U.S. promises and wash away its crimes. At the same time, the American aggressors are conspiring to carry out a larger-scale massacre and persecution of our captured personnel. According to a May 17 report by the United Press, "Paratroopers of the battle-hardened U.S. 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment have arrived at the POW camp surrounded by flamethrower tanks, trucks equipped with four .50-caliber machine guns, and solid bunkers." According to a May 17 Associated Press report from Tokyo, these U.S. paratroopers were sent to Geoje Island on Clark's orders "to prevent large-scale riots by prisoners." At the same time, an internal telegram from the Associated Press Tokyo on May 14 revealed that there are still about 10,000 of our captured personnel being "screened." The American aggressors' continued pursuit of these criminal activities has made it clearer to the people of the world that the conspiracy of the US side at the negotiation meetings to stubbornly adhere to its unilateral and unreasonable proposal of April 28 until now is to continue to implement inhumane treatment of our captured personnel and continue to forcibly detain them as cannon fodder, thereby sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations.

    The Chinese and Korean people resolutely oppose the American aggressors' sinister conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel. Our Chief Representative General Nam Il has repeatedly stated that our side resolutely rejects the US side's unilateral and unreasonable proposal of April 28, pointing out that our reasonable compromise proposal of May 2 is the only reasonable basis for resolving the POW issue. The spokesman for the headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers also firmly supported the just demands of our captured personnel in his May 16 statement, resolutely opposed the US side's bloody policy of violating the Geneva Convention against our captured personnel, and resolutely and unshakably opposed the US side's unilateral and unreasonable plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel. With the support of the just people of the world, the Chinese and Korean people are waging an unyielding struggle to defeat the new conspiracy of the United States to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations.

    国际述评
    争取亚洲及太平洋区域的和平
    美帝国主义疯狂推行战争政策，严重地威胁世界和平，威胁着亚洲及太平洋区域的和平安全。因此，保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，已成为保卫世界和平的重要部分，它是一切爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民当前最迫切的要求。我国努力和平事业的著名人士宋庆龄、郭沫若等十一人，代表我国人民的意志，于三月二十一日联名邀请亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平的著名人士，共同发起“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”以后，迅速获得亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国广大的爱好和平人士的热烈响应。截至五月十五日止，已有澳大利亚、蒙古、尼加拉瓜、危地马拉、缅甸、印度尼西亚、哥伦比亚、朝鲜、印度、智利、墨西哥、萨尔瓦多、锡兰、加拿大、巴基斯坦、美国、日本、越南、寮国、苏联等二十个国家的和平人士，一致表示拥护在我国首都北京召开这一会议。各国纷纷成立了参加和平会议的筹备委员会，积极推选代表出席即将在北京举行的筹备会议。这充分表现了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民争取和平的热烈愿望和保卫和平的坚决意志。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民所以这样热烈拥护召开和平会议就因为美国积极准备扩大侵略战争的可怖的阴影，正严重地威胁着他们国家的独立和自由；目前美帝国主义在亚洲及太平洋区域到处建立军事基地，到处搜罗炮灰和战争资源的罪恶活动，已使这些国家的人民的生活受到了严重的损害。他们知道：保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平的斗争，也就是争取他们的国家独立和改善他们国家人民的生活的斗争。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起，给这一区域的人民指出团结一致共同争取和平的道路，因而这个会议获得了各国人民的热烈拥护和积极参加。
    击败美国破坏朝鲜谈判新阴谋
    近来美国侵略者正在进行拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的新阴谋。美方谈判代表正在谈判会议上采取不协商、不讲理的蛮横态度，继续坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张；同时，美方飞机又于五月十二日袭击我方代表团车辆，杀害我代表团工作人员，并于五月十四日侵入开城中立区进行扫射，连续违反协议，制造挑衅事件。美国侵略者的新阴谋所要达到的目的，依然是要强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员，继续拖延和破坏朝鲜谈判，制造国际紧张局势。
    美方谈判代表在谈判代表团大会上，继续重复所谓“公开并共同证实战俘甄别”和所谓“对战俘甄别过程进行公正证实”的荒谬主张，并无耻宣传“人道主义的待遇”和“尊重战俘天赋的权利”的谎言，来为他们强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶计划辩护。美国侵略者这些颠倒黑白的无耻谎言，不仅一再遭到我方首席代表南日将军的严正驳斥，而且更为越来越多的不可辩驳的事实所揭穿。最近巨济岛上我方被俘人员为争取合理待遇与生返祖国的权利而进行的英勇斗争，更使美国侵略者的阴谋彻底破产。
    巨济岛上美方战俘营中的我方被俘人员，在对美国侵略者使用暴力强迫进行所谓“甄别”的忍无可忍的情况下，曾一度扣留了美方战俘营负责人杜德，并向美方提出四项合理的正义的要求：要求美方立即停止野蛮行为，停止侮辱、酷刑、强迫写血书、大批屠杀、使用战俘为毒气细菌武器和原子弹的试验对象，保证让战俘享受国际法所规定的人权和个人生活；立即停止对我方被俘人员实行非法的所谓“自愿遣返”；停止强迫“甄别”和重新武装战俘。我方被俘人员的要求，充分暴露了美国侵略者违反日内瓦战俘公约的血腥暴行。由于这种暴行已经到了不能掩盖的程度，美方战俘营负责人柯尔生在他对我方被俘人员的要求的答复中，不得不“肯定承认有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或打伤”的事实，并保证将来“战俘可以希望得到符合国际公法原则的人道待遇”，要“使暴力行动和流血事件不再发生”，“不再进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动”。柯尔生的答复，就是美国侵略者违反国际公法，屠杀和迫害我方被俘人员的血腥供状。我方被俘人员的要求和柯尔生的答复中所反映出来的不可辩驳的事实，已使美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的罪恶阴谋，彻底暴露在全世界人民面前。
    在这种铁的事实的面前，美国侵略者不但毫无悔祸之心，反而背信弃义地推翻了柯尔生对我方被俘人员所作的诺言，妄图洗刷其永远洗刷不掉的血腥罪行。新任侵朝美军总司令克拉克于五月十五日依照美国陆军部的命令发表声明，竟无耻抵赖说，柯尔生所作的诺言“没有丝毫效力”。美国国防部也于五月十三日发表声明，妄图推翻美方的诺言和洗刷罪行。与此同时，美国侵略者正在阴谋对我方被俘人员进行更大规模的屠杀和迫害。据合众社五月十七日电讯透露：“久经战斗的美国第一八七空运步兵团的伞兵们到达了已经被喷火坦克、架着四挺五十公厘口径机关枪的卡车和坚固的掩体包围着的战俘营。”另据美联社东京五月十七日电讯透露：这支美军伞兵是根据克拉克的命令“到巨济岛去防止俘虏的大规模暴动”的。同时，美联社东京五月十四日的内部电报更透露了目前还有一万左右的我方被俘人员在被“甄别”。美国侵略者继续进行这些罪恶的活动，使全世界人民更清楚地看到：美方在谈判会议上直到现在仍然蛮横坚持其四月二十八日片面无理方案的阴谋，就是要继续对我方被俘人员实行非人道的待遇，并继续强迫扣留他们充当炮灰，从而破坏朝鲜停战谈判。
    中朝人民坚决反对美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶阴谋。我方首席代表南日将军一再声明：我方断然拒绝美方四月二十八日的片面无理方案，指出我方五月二日的合理折衷方案是解决战俘问题的唯一的合理基础。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军总部发言人五月十六日的谈话中，也坚决支持我方被俘人员的正义要求，坚决反对美方对我方被俘人员的违反日内瓦公约的血腥政策，并坚决不可动摇地反对美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的片面无理方案。中朝人民在全世界正义人民的支持下，正在为击败美国拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的新阴谋进行不屈不挠的斗争。
