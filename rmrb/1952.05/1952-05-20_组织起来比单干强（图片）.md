    Organizing is Stronger than Going it Alone

    (19) Wang Quanbao hadn't finished harvesting his millet when a strong wind started blowing. Seeing the millet grains about to be threshed away, he stamped his feet and said, "Heavens! What am I going to do!" But the wind showed no mercy. Wang Quanbao was anxious, but helpless. His son and daughter-in-law complained about him. His son said, "It's nothing to do with the heavens, you only think about your own small gains..."
    (20) Just as they were worrying, they suddenly saw a group of people coming from the north end of the field. It turned out to be Li Sixiao's mutual aid team. Li Sixiao walked up to Wang Quanbao and said with a smile, "Brother Quanbao, how could we stand by and watch your millet be threshed away by the wind? Let us help you harvest it." The Quanbao father and son were so grateful that they couldn't speak.
    (21) Li Sixiao's mutual aid team had a bumper harvest this year, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu. Every household had full granaries. They processed and milled the best grain and quickly handed over their patriotic public grain.

    （十九）王全保还没来得及割完谷子，大风刮起来了。眼看着谷粒都要磨光啦，他跺着脚说：“老天爷呀！你叫我怎么办呀！”然而大风不留情，王全保干着急，没办法。儿子媳妇埋怨他。儿子说：“干老天爷啥事，尽怨你光算小账……”
    （二十）他们正在着急的时候，忽然看见地北头来了一伙人。原来是李四小互助组来啦。李四小走到王全保跟前笑嘻嘻地说：“全保哥，咱们那能看着你的谷子让风磨了呢？让我们来帮助你们割吧。”全保父子听了，感激得说不出话来。
    （二十一）李四小互助组今年丰收啦，每亩平均产量是四百五十斤，家家都是大囤成尖小囤满。他们把最好的粮食加工细碾，很快地交了爱国公粮。
