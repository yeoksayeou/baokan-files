    Reader's Letter

    Suggest that government cadres and Party members in various places write more letters to soldiers on behalf of military families.
    Editor: I am a revolutionary soldier. I suggest that comrades with literacy in the township and village governments, Party organizations, and Youth League organizations in various places write more letters to revolutionary soldiers on behalf of military families.
    I often read letters for my comrade soldiers around me. In the letters I have read, many are full of clichés and strange expressions, making the meaning difficult to understand, and some even contain ideologically incorrect words. According to my understanding from various sources, many of the people who write these letters are "fortune tellers" and "feng shui masters," or people with very backward ideas. The letters they write do not reflect the military families' hard work in production, their progress, and the preferential treatment they receive.
    I believe that communication between revolutionary soldiers and their families has a great encouraging effect on both sides. If the township and village governments, Party organizations, and Youth League organizations in various places can pay attention to the issue of letter writing for local military families and provide appropriate assistance, it will not only encourage revolutionary soldiers but also strengthen the connection between military families and the Party, the Youth League, and the government. This will allow the government to understand the situation of the military families in detail, making it easier to improve preferential treatment work. Chen Huixiong

### 建议各地政府干部和党团员多替军属给战士写家信

    建议各地政府干部和党团员  多替军属给战士写家信
    编辑同志：我是一个革命军人，我建议各地乡、村政府及党的组织、团的组织中有文化的同志，多替军属给革命军人写家信。
    我常为我周围的战士同志们看家信。在我看过的信中，有许多充满了陈词怪语，意思很难看懂，甚至有一些立场错误的话。据我多方面了解，代写这类家信的人，有许多是“卜卦”和“看风水”的，或者是思想很落后的人。他们代写的信，不能反映军属努力生产、进步以及受优待的情况。
    我认为，革命军人和家属通信，对双方的鼓舞作用都是很大的。如果各地乡、村政府及党的组织、团的组织能够重视当地军属写信的问题，并给以适当的帮助，不但可使革命军人受到鼓舞，并且也加强了军属和党、团、政府间的联系，可以使政府详细了解军属们的情况，便于改进优抚工作。陈辉雄
