    The Soviet press plays a significant role in the lives of the Soviet people. Its entire history of development is an inseparable part of the heroic history of the Lenin-Stalin Party, an inseparable part of the Party's great struggle for the victory of the working people and for the construction of communism.

    This year, May 5th marks the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the mass Bolshevik newspaper "Pravda." "Pravda" was founded according to Lenin's instructions and personally presided over by Stalin. Its publication was a memorable festival for the Russian proletariat and an event of great revolutionary significance. "Pravda" was a powerful weapon in the hands of the Bolshevik Party in the work of consolidating the Party's organization. It won over the vast working class and laboring masses to the side of Bolshevism, who regarded "Pravda" as a cordial and understandable newspaper, expressing their trust in it and listening attentively to its voice.

    "Pravda" cultivated an entire generation of revolutionary proletarians, the very people who later carried out the October Socialist Revolution.

    Stalin pointed out: "The 'Pravda' of 1912 laid the foundation for the victory of Bolshevism in 1917." ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," p. 192)

    For forty years, "Pravda" has consistently served the great cause of Lenin and Stalin and united the laboring masses around the Bolshevik Party. It has won the love of the Soviet people. Now the Soviet Union has a vast network of newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses. The Soviet press is a powerful force for building a new life. The day of May 5, 1912, will be forever remembered in the hearts of the laboring people: May 5th became a festival commemorating a new type of revolutionary Bolshevik press that is closely connected with the masses.

    Stalin said: "The press is the most powerful weapon, with the help of which the Party speaks to the working class daily and hourly in the language it needs. There is no other tool, no other similarly flexible organ in the world that extends the spiritual connection between the Party and the class."
    ("Stalin's Collected Works," Volume 5, p. 204)

    The Soviet press is a constant and powerful tool for the communist education of the laboring people, a tireless collective propagandist, agitator, and organizer of the masses. It is an indispensable part of the lives of the Soviet people, an active fighter for the victory of communism. The truthful words of the Soviet press help the laboring people to clearly and deeply understand the laws of social development and the political significance of newly occurring events, enabling them to see the purpose of their heroic struggle and selfless labor, correctly assess the achievements they have made, so as to make greater efforts to achieve new achievements, more stubbornly overcome any obstacles, and eliminate shortcomings in their work.

    From the very first day of the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin and Stalin paid great attention to establishing a brand-new press, impossible under capitalism.

    In March 1918, Lenin, speaking of the current tasks of the Soviet regime, pointed out that the Party should "turn newspapers from organs that mainly report political news into serious organs that provide economic education to the masses."
    ("Lenin's Collected Works," Volume 27, p. 176) Lenin proposed that the task of the new type of Soviet press was to serve as a tool for re-educating the masses politically and economically, a tool for making hundreds of millions of Soviet people understand how to arrange life and organize labor in a new way.

    In the famous essay "On Our Newspapers," Lenin pointed out that Soviet society has transitioned from capitalism to socialism, and the face of the newspapers should be drastically changed because these newspapers have to perform another task and serve new goals. He wrote: "Talk more about economics. By economics, we do not mean 'general' inferences, scholarly investigations, intellectual plans, and so on… No, the economics we want refers to the collection, meticulous examination, and research of various undertakings that are truly building a new life." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Volume 28, p. 79)

    Lenin taught that in the period of transition from capitalism to communism, the primary task of newspapers is to educate the laboring masses with vivid and concrete examples from all aspects of life, to conduct a ruthless and genuine revolutionary struggle against elements that harm the cause of socialist construction, and to launch Bolshevik criticism of shortcomings.

    Lenin put forward affirmative requirements for newspapers: "Publish less political rhetoric. Publish less intellectual discussions. Get closer to life. Pay more attention to how the workers and peasants are in fact, in their daily work, building new things. Check more on how much of this new thing is communism." ("Lenin's Collected Works," Volume 28, p. 80)

    By implementing the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, the Bolshevik press has become the most powerful and sharp weapon of the Communist Party, an indispensable tool for educating the laboring masses with communism. In all its work, it follows the policies of the Bolshevik Party, which form the basis of life in the Soviet system, and constantly instills Marxist-Leninist ideology into the masses.

    Millions of people participate in the work of Soviet newspapers, magazines, and publishing houses. Worker-peasant correspondents are activists for every Soviet newspaper and magazine. The editorial departments of newspapers and magazines receive hundreds and thousands of letters from readers every day, and these letters, essays, and correspondence are published in a planned manner.

    Stalin taught that worker-peasant correspondents are "commanders of proletarian public opinion, commanders who strive to guide the inexhaustible power of this great element to help the Party and the Soviet regime carry out the difficult task of socialist construction." ("Stalin's Collected Works," Volume 6, p. 262) The bourgeois press is manipulated by a small handful of self-serving news oligarchs who serve the bourgeois regime. The Soviet press and the press of the people's democracies, on the other hand, are closely linked to the people and belong to the people. It is a true people's forum, an expression of the public opinion of the laboring people.

    As a forum for spreading advanced experience, the Soviet press encourages the creativity of the laboring people by all means, popularizes the experience of production innovators, and organizes large-scale socialist competitions for the entire people. The laboring people see in their own newspapers a huge force that helps them solve various urgent problems in communist construction, quickly overcome shortcomings in their work, and achieve ever-increasing achievements.

    In the cause of propagating Marxist-Leninist theory and educating the masses with communism, the tasks of the Soviet press are great and important. Soviet newspapers and magazines regularly publish essays on the history and theory of Bolshevism, assist in the study of Marxist-Leninist speeches and discussions, answers to readers' questions, and other propaganda materials, using these to help workers understand the laws of social development and the knowledge of political struggle, and help them to clearly see the fruits of labor, and the great goals pointed out by the Communist Party and the brilliant leader and teacher Comrade Stalin. The power of the press lies in its ability to immediately spread a certain idea, scientific truth, and the achievements of advanced science to the broadest masses of laboring people, making it the property of everyone. In propagating Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet press is the main and decisive weapon. It is the national propaganda forum. It promotes the further prosperity of Soviet advanced science, literature, and art, and promotes the development of the creativity and talent of all workers.

    Stalin instructed that "the growth of the press should be measured not by days, but by hours, because it is the sharpest and most powerful weapon of our Party." The Communist Party has consistently implemented this instruction in its life. In pre-revolutionary old Russia, a total of 859 newspapers were published, with a total circulation of 2.7 million copies per issue; in the Soviet Union, more than 8,150 newspapers are now published, with a total circulation of about 40 million copies per issue. Soviet newspapers, like magazines and books, are published in dozens of languages of the nationalities living in the great socialist country. They have an extremely wide readership. The number of books published in the Soviet Union is also enormous. It is enough to point out this one thing: since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union has published far more than one million kinds of books, with a circulation of 14 billion copies. In the past few years, the fourth edition of the 35-volume "Complete Works of Lenin" has been published, and the 13-volume "Collected Works of Stalin" has been published, which is the greatest spiritual wealth and a treasure of true creative Marxism. The works of Soviet writers, Russian classical writers, and world literature are published in large quantities in the Soviet Union. Thanks to the consistent care of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, the Soviet press develops year after year, gloriously fulfilling the tasks it faces.

    The truly popular and sincerely free Soviet press is the most active defender of peace, ruthlessly exposing the conspiracies of the instigators of a new world war.

    The Soviet press, founded by the great teachers of mankind, Lenin and Stalin, is fighting for the communist victory of the Soviet Union, holding high the banner of unyielding warriors, opposing all the dark forces of the capitalist world, and persistently striving for peace and the security of all peoples. It realizes the instructions of the genius Stalin: "The broad movement to defend peace, as a tool for exposing the criminal conspiracies of the warmongers, now has the most significant meaning."
    (Stalin's conversation with the reporter of "Pravda") In the struggle for peace and friendship among all peoples, the Soviet press constantly receives the support of the press of the people's democratic countries and the communist and democratic press in capitalist countries. The truthful words of the press of the peaceful and democratic camp give the working people of all countries firm confidence in the inevitable victory of the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    建设新生活的强大力量
    苏联  列别节夫
    苏维埃报刊在苏联人民的生活中起着重大的作用。它的全部发展历史是列宁斯大林党的英雄历史的不可分割的一部分，是党与争取劳动人民胜利、争取建设共产主义的伟大斗争的不可分割的一部分。
    今年五月五日是群众性的布尔什维克报纸“真理报”创刊整整四十周年的纪念日。“真理报”是根据列宁的指示，由斯大林亲自主持而创办的。它的出版，对俄罗斯无产阶级来说，是一个值得纪念的节日，是一个具有巨大革命意义的事件。在巩固党的组织的工作中，“真理报”是布尔什维克党手中的强有力的武器。它把广大的工人阶级和劳动群众争取到布尔什维主义的方面来，他们把“真理报”看作是亲切的和能够理解的报纸，对它表示信任，并关心地倾听它的声音。
    “真理报”培养了革命的无产阶级的整整一代人，就是这些人后来举行了十月社会主义革命。
    斯大林曾指出：“一九一二年的‘真理报’，奠定了布尔什维主义一九一七年胜利的基础。”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”，一九二页）
    四十年来“真理报”一贯忠实地为列宁——斯大林的伟大事业服务并且把劳动群众团结在布尔什维克党的周围。它获得苏联人民的热爱。现在苏联有着广大的报纸、杂志和出版社网。苏联报刊是建设新生活的强大力量。一九一二年五月五日这一天在劳动人民的心中永志不忘：五月五日成为纪念新型的革命的密切联系群众的布尔什维克报刊的节日。
    斯大林说：“报刊——这是最有力的武器，在它的帮助下，党每日每时地用自己所需要的语言，来同工人阶级讲话。在党与阶级之间扩展精神联系的别的工具，别的类似的灵活机关，天地间还没有。”
    （“斯大林全集”，第五卷，二○四页）
    苏联报刊是劳动人民共产主义教育的经常的有力的工具，是不倦不休的集体宣传者，鼓动者和群众的组织者。它是苏联人民的生活中不可缺少的东西，是争取共产主义胜利的积极战士。苏联报刊的真实文字，帮助劳动人民清楚地和深刻地认识社会发展规律和新发生事件的政治意义，使他们看到自己的英勇斗争和忘我劳动的目的，正确地估计已获得的成绩，以便用更大的努力来达到新的成就，更顽强地克服任何障碍，并消除自己工作中的缺点。
    从伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的第一天起，列宁、斯大林就对建立崭新的、资本主义条件下所不可能有的新闻事业，予以极大的注意。
    一九一八年三月，列宁在谈到苏维埃政权的当前任务时曾指出，党应当“把报纸从主要是报道政治新闻的机关变成严肃的给群众以经济教育的机关”
    （“列宁全集”，二十七卷，一七六页）列宁提出新型的苏维埃报刊的任务是要做为在政治上的和经济上重新教育群众的工具，是使亿万的苏联人民懂得如何按照新的方式安排生活和组织劳动的工具。
    在著名的论文“论我们的报纸”中，列宁指出，苏联社会已由资本主义转变为社会主义，报纸的面貌应当断然改变，因为这些报纸要执行另一种任务，要为新的目标服务。他写道：“多谈些经济。所谓经济不是指‘一般’推论，学者考察，知识分子计划，以及其他……不是的，我们所要的经济，是指搜集、缜密检查及研究新生活的真正的建设各种事业而言。”（“列宁全集”，二十八卷，七九页）
    列宁教导说，在从资本主义过渡到共产主义的时期，报纸的首要任务是用生活中各方面的生动的、具体的范例来教育劳动群众，是与损害社会主义建设事业的分子进行无情的真正的革命斗争，是对缺点展开布尔什维克的批评。
    列宁对报纸提出了肯定的要求：“少登载些政治空谈。少登载些知识分子的议论。多接近些生活。多注意工农群众在事实上、在其日常工作中，怎样在建设新的东西。多多检查这种新的东西有多少是共产主义的。”（“列宁全集”，二十八卷，八○页）
    由于执行了列宁、斯大林的指示，布尔什维克报刊成为共产党的最有力的和最锐利的武器，变为以共产主义教育劳动群众的不可缺少的工具。它在全部工作中遵循着组成苏维埃制度生活基础的布尔什维克党的政策，不断地向群众灌输马克思—列宁主义思想。
    参加苏联的报纸、杂志和出版社的工作的有数百万人。工农通讯员是苏联每一个报纸和杂志的积极分子。报纸和杂志的编辑部每天都收到读者的成百成千的信件，并有计划地把这些信件、论文和通讯发表。
    斯大林教导说，工农通讯员是“无产阶级舆论的指挥官，这种指挥官力求指导这个伟大要素的不可耗尽的力量，来帮助党和苏维埃政权进行困难的社会主义建设事业。”（“斯大林全集”，第六卷，二六二页）资产阶级报纸是操纵在一小撮为资产阶级政权效劳的唯利是图的新闻寡头手中。而苏联报刊和人民民主国家报刊则是密切与人民相联并成为人民所有。它是真正的人民讲坛，是劳动人民舆论的表达者。
    作为传播先进经验的讲坛的苏联报刊，用一切办法鼓励劳动人民的创造性，普及生产革新者的经验，并组织大规模的全体人民的社会主义竞赛。劳动人民从自己的报纸中看到一种巨大的力量，这种力量帮助他们解决共产主义建设中的种种迫切问题，迅速克服工作中的缺点，取得日新月异的成就。
    在宣传马列主义理论和以共产主义教育群众的事业中，苏联报刊的任务是伟大而重要的。苏联报纸和杂志经常刊载有关布尔什维主义的历史和理论问题的论文，协助研究马克思—列宁主义的演讲和讨论，对读者问题的答复，以及其他宣传材料，用这些东西来帮助劳动者通晓社会发展规律和政治斗争的知识，帮助他们清楚地看到劳动的成果，看到由共产党和天才的领袖与导师斯大林同志所指出的伟大目标。报刊的力量在于，它能够把某一种思想、科学真理和先进科学的成就，立刻传播给最广大的劳动群众，使之成为大家的财产。在宣传马克思——列宁主义方面，苏联报刊是主要的有决定意义的武器。它是全国的宣传讲坛。它促进苏联先进科学、文学和艺术的进一步繁荣，促进一切劳动者的创造力和才能的发展。
    斯大林指示说，“报刊的成长，应当不是以日计，而是以小时计，因为它是我们党的最锐利最有力的武器。”共产党在生活中一贯地执行了这一指示。在革命前的旧俄罗斯共出版报纸八百五十九种，每期总份数为二百七十万份；而在苏联，现在出版有八千一百五十种以上的报纸，每期总份数约达四千万份。苏联的报纸，和杂志、书籍一样，都是用好几十种居住在伟大社会主义国家的民族文字出版的。它们拥有极其广大的读者。苏联的书籍出版数量也是巨大的。只须指出这一件事就够了：从苏维埃政权成立以来，苏联出版的书籍远超过一百万种，发行册数达一百四十亿册。过去数年间，第四版的三十五卷的列宁全集出版了，斯大林全集出了十三卷，这是最伟大的精神财富和真正的创造性马克思主义的宝物。苏联作家、俄罗斯古典作家和世界文学的作品，在苏联大量出版。由于共产党和苏联政府的始终如一的关怀，苏联报刊年复一年地发展，光荣地完成着它所面对的任务。
    真正人民的和真诚的自由的苏联报刊，是最积极的和平保卫者，无情地揭露新世界战争挑拨者的阴谋。
    由人类伟大导师列宁、斯大林所创立的苏维埃报刊，正为苏联的共产主义胜利而斗争，它高举着不屈不挠的战士的旗帜，反对资本主义世界的一切黑暗势力，坚持地争取和平和各族人民的安全。它实现着天才的斯大林的指示：“广泛的维护和平的运动，作为揭露战争贩子罪恶阴谋的工具，现在具有最重大的意义。”
    （斯大林对“真理报”记者的谈话）在争取和平与各族人民友谊的斗争中，苏联报刊经常得到人民民主国家报刊和资本主义国家中共产主义的与民主的报刊的拥护和支持。和平民主阵营的报刊的真实文字，使各国劳动人民对和平、民主与社会主义力量的必然胜利，获得坚定的信心。（附图片）
