Xinhua News Agency, May 24th dispatch from New York: The "New York Times" recently published an article by military commentator Baldwin discussing the shortage of personnel in the American Air Force. This article fully exposes how the American ruling clique is finding it increasingly difficult to deceive American youth into sacrificing their lives for their war plans.

    The article begins with the sensational incidents that recently occurred in several American air bases, where officers refused to take off. The article states: "The so-called 'disobedience' and refusal to fly by some American Air Force reserve officers overshadows a more fundamental and far more serious development striking at the heart of the American Air Force." The more fundamental "development" referred to here is: "Flying, which was once the most ardent goal of Americans, has now declined to a dangerous degree."

    The article cites examples to illustrate this "dramatic shift," saying: "West Point and Annapolis Naval Academy, which have always supplied 25 percent of the Air Force's graduating classes, are now unable to complete their pilot quotas. This is the first time since World War II. At the Naval Academy, applications for Air Force ground duty exceed the quota, while the number of volunteers for flight training, which used to exceed the quota by two times, cannot make up the shortfall this year. Of the 484 medically qualified individuals at Annapolis Naval Academy, only 207 requested to undertake flight duties in the Air Force or Naval Aviation. Of the 6,700 people scheduled to graduate from the US Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program this year, only 1,800 volunteered to fly, and of these, only 750 are qualified in terms of physical condition and other aspects."

    Not only is the number of American Air Force reserve personnel insufficient, but their quality has also greatly decreased. Baldwin said: From August to December of last year, the Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School only had about half of the prescribed number of students. Moreover, most of them have only received the bare minimum of necessary education. The U.S. Air Force is also finding it difficult to obtain qualified aviation officer candidates. He also said: "Many new flight personnel in the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Naval Aviation are, in fact, merely "airplane drivers" who have not received the education an officer should receive, nor do they have leadership ability." Baldwin pointed out that in order to make up for the shortfall, the original educational level and physical standards have been "lowered to the minimum," but "even so, the U.S. Air Force authorities are still unable to recruit to full capacity."

    Finally, the article concludes sadly: These things "certainly constitute the current crisis. At least, now, fewer people are requesting to fly… The simple and easy days when there was no need to worry about flight personnel are gone forever, America and American youth have changed." Baldwin here dares not further explain why American youth have "changed." The fact is: American youth are increasingly aware that the Truman administration's war plans are driving them to make meaningless sacrifices, and the era in which the United States could dominate the skies is already "gone forever."

Xinhua News Agency, May 24th dispatch from TASS, New York, May 20th: The "Chicago Tribune" published a letter from Korea, signed "A Completely Fed-Up American Soldier," which proves that the morale of the American interventionist forces in Korea is declining day by day. The letter says: Any news about losses suffered by the interventionist forces will cause fluctuations among the American soldiers. When they hear this news, they will unanimously ask the question: Why? What is the purpose? What has been gained?

    The writer categorically refutes the nonsense of some Washington officials who have visited Korea, who say that the morale of American soldiers is very high. He sarcastically asks: "I don't know who they talked to to reach this conclusion. I don't think they talked to the dirty, extremely fed-up American soldiers huddled in bunkers, did they?"

### 美国统治者难于诱骗青年当炮灰  美国空军人员缺乏  侵朝美军士气亦日益低落

    美国统治者难于诱骗青年当炮灰
    美国空军人员缺乏
    侵朝美军士气亦日益低落
    【新华社二十四日讯】纽约消息：“纽约时报”最近发表了军事评论员鲍尔温一篇论述美国空军人员缺乏的文章，这篇文章充分暴露了美国统治集团已愈来愈难于诱骗美国青年为他们的战争计划卖命。
    文章从最近美国几个空军基地中发生的军官拒绝起飞的轰动一时的事件谈起，文章说：“一些美国空军后备军官的所谓‘违抗命令’、拒绝飞行的事件，遮住了一个更基本的、远为严重的打击美国空军心脏的发展。”这里所指的更基本的“发展”就是：“飞行以前曾经是美国人最热中的目标，现在这种热情已下降到危险的程度。”
    文章举例说明这种“戏剧性的转变”说：“西点军校和安那普里斯海军军官学校，一向以毕业班人数的百分之二十五供应空军，现在都没有办法完成他们的飞行员配额了，自从第二次世界大战以来，这是第一次。在海军军官学校里，申请做空军地面勤务的超过了定额，志愿受飞行训练的人，以前总是超过定额两倍，今年却无法补足缺额。安那普里斯海军军官学校四百八十四名体格及格的人中，只有二百零七人请求在空军或海军航空队中担负飞行任务。今年美国空军后备军官训练团计划毕业的六千七百人中，只有一千八百人自愿飞行，而其中又只有七百五十人是在体格和其他方面及格的。”
    美国空军后备人员不只数量不足，而且质量也大大降低了。鲍尔温说：去年八月到十二月，海军的飞行士官生只够规定数额的约一半。而且其中大部分只受过最起码的必需教育。美国空军也难以获得合格的飞行士官生。他又说：“美国空军以及美国海军航空队的许许多多的新进飞行人员，事实上仅仅是一些“开飞机的”，并没有受过一个军官所应受的教育，也没有领导能力。”鲍尔温指出：为了补足缺额，已经把原定的教育程度和体格标准“降到最低限度”，但“即使如此，美国空军当局也还无法招收满额”。
    最后，文章忧郁地作结说：这些事情“确乎构成了目前的危机。至少，在现在，要求飞行的人在减少了……对于飞行人员用不到关心的那种单纯容易的日子，已经一去不返，美国和美国青年们都变了。”鲍尔温在这里不敢进一步说明，美国青年们为什么“变了”。事实是：美国青年们已愈来愈多地了解到，杜鲁门政府的战争计划正在驱使他们作无谓的牺牲，并且，美国能在空中横行的时代是已经“一去不返”了。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：“芝加哥论坛报”刊载了一封来自朝鲜的信，署名是“一个完全厌倦了的美国大兵”，这封信证明在朝鲜的美国干涉军的士气已在日渐低落。信里说：任何关于干涉军遭受损失的消息都会在美国士兵中间引起波动。他们听到了这些消息，就会不约而同地提出这样的问题：为什么？有什么目的？得到了甚么？
    写信者断然驳斥了一些访问过朝鲜的华盛顿官员们的谰言——说什么美国士兵的士气很高。他尖刻地问道：“我不知道他们是和谁谈话后得出这个结论的，我想他们未曾和伏在地堡里面的、肮脏的、极端厌倦了的美国大兵谈话吧？”
