    I Personally Experienced the Benefits of Painless Childbirth

    To the Editor: I am a female internist. I successfully gave birth on May 8th after trying the Soviet painless childbirth method at the Clinical College of the First Military Medical University. In a happy mood, I would like to share my experiences with painless childbirth during the delivery process with sisters and midwifery workers across the country, hoping that they will accept this best childbirth method and relieve the pain of women during childbirth.

    When I was about to give birth, I had many concerns. First of all, I was afraid of pain. Before I entered the Clinical College of the First Military Medical University, several doctors with childbirth experience told me: "It is very painful during childbirth, as if the pelvis is cracking." I was even more scared after hearing these words. Secondly, I was afraid of accidents. I fell ill for two months after pregnancy and had mild proteinuria. I was very worried about dystocia. When I arrived at the Clinical College, the president and the head of the department told me about the Soviet painless childbirth method. After hearing this, I was half-convinced, but I also hoped that this childbirth method would be successful in my delivery, so as to relieve me of this pain. So I took a "try it" attitude towards this childbirth method. The president understood my feelings and enlightened me politically, so that I realized that this childbirth method is an advanced scientific method that has been practiced in the Soviet Union, and there is no need to doubt it. In this way, my understanding and confidence in painless childbirth improved a step further. I not only accepted it in theory, but also accepted it emotionally. I waited patiently for the arrival of childbirth. Before giving birth, I paid great attention to the doctor's skills, but in this delivery, I realized that it is very important for doctors to care about and have a strong sense of responsibility towards the parturient. During my delivery, the doctors and nurses took care of me in every possible way and comforted me in order to prevent me from being afraid, so that I remained calm throughout.

    In the first stage of labor, the uterus had rhythmic contractions. At this time, I only felt soreness in the pelvic and lumbar regions, but no pain. In the second stage of labor, when the fetus was expelled, there was no pain at all, only slight pain when the fetus passed through the vagina. During the delivery process, the doctors and nurses kept helping me massage my lower back, which made me feel very comfortable. When the uterus contracted, I calmly exhaled and strengthened my abdominal pressure under the doctor's instructions. During the delivery, I cooperated well with the doctor and made full use of my initiative, so I had such a successful delivery.

    I personally experienced that the Soviet painless childbirth method is a gospel for parturient women. I hope that obstetricians will carefully study and promote it.

    我切身体验到了无痛分娩法的好处
    编辑同志：我是一个内科女医师。我在第一军医大学临床学院试用苏联无痛分娩法，于五月八日成功地分娩。我在高兴的情绪下，愿把我在分娩过程中对无痛分娩法的几点体会，告诉给全国姊妹们和助产工作者，希望他们接受这个最好的分娩法，免除产妇在分娩时的痛苦。
    我临产时，发生很多顾虑。我首先是怕痛。在我没有进第一军医大学临床学院时，好几位有过分娩经验的大夫对我说：“分娩时疼痛得很，好似骨盘裂开”。我听了这些话就更害怕了。其次，我怕发生意外。我妊娠后曾病倒了两个月，有轻度蛋白尿的现象，很担心难产。到了临床学院，院长和科长把苏联的无痛分娩法告诉了我。我听了以后，半信半疑，但是我也很希望这个分娩法在我的分娩中，能够得到成功，以免除我这场痛苦。于是我就抱着
    “试一试”的态度来对待这个分娩法。院长了解了我的心情，就从政治上来启发我，使我认识这种分娩法是苏联已经实行了的先进科学方法，没有怀疑的必要。这样，我对无痛分娩法的认识和信心都提高了一步，我不但在学理上接受，在感情上也接受了。我安心地等待着分娩的来临。我在产前很注意大夫技术的好坏，但是在这次分娩中，我体会到了大夫对产妇的关心和责任心强是非常重要的。在我分娩时，大夫和护士们为了不使我发生恐惧，他们都无微不至地体贴我，安慰我，使我以后一直都保持着安静。
    我在分娩的第一期，子宫发生节律性的收缩，这时只感觉骨盘部和腰部发酸，而没有发痛；在分娩第二期胎儿排出时，毫无痛苦现象，只有胎儿过阴道时，才稍觉微痛。在分娩的过程中，大夫和护士不断地帮助我按摩腰部，使我感到很舒服。在子宫收缩时，我在大夫的指示下，从容地迸气和加强腹压。在分娩中，我和大夫合作得很好，也充分运用了自己的主动性，所以才有如此成功的分娩。
    我切身体验到，苏联无痛分娩法对产妇们是一个福音，希望产科医生们细心地加以研究并推行。
