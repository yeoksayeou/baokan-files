    Shanxi Licheng County, Honghe Village Farmer Dong Hetang:
    Recognizing the Error of Purely Getting Rich, Determined to Improve the Mutual Aid Team
    Comrade Editor: I am a peasant who was emancipated. In my childhood, I lived a life of poverty. My father died early, and my mother remarried, leaving behind my three brothers. One was sold to someone due to a disaster, one died, and only I was left. From a young age, I worked as a hired hand, living like cattle and horses. After the Communist Party came, I was liberated. When I was a hired hand, I suffered immensely but managed to save a little money and bought five mu of land. Later, with the implementation of land reform, I was allocated another two mu of land, totaling seven mu. I responded to the call of the Communist Party and joined the mutual aid team. My life improved day by day with the increase in production, and I began to escape poverty. However, at this time, I developed erroneous thoughts, thinking about getting rich individually, and went down the wrong path. I wanted to buy more land and develop production individually. So I took out the grain I had accumulated over the years and bought more than twenty mu of land. I was extremely happy about this. But I made another mistake. I couldn't cultivate so much land myself, and when I put it in the mutual aid team, everyone was unwilling to cultivate so much for me, so I leased out twelve mu of land. At this time, I felt very uneasy, thinking, wouldn't I become a landlord like this? However, this did not dispel my selfish desire to get rich. I still thought about how to collect more rent and how to acquire houses and land. As a result, I lost enthusiasm for production, and production did not improve. This year, the city is carrying out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. I heard and saw the vicious methods used by illegal bourgeois elements against our cadres and felt extreme hatred. At this time, I thought of myself, originally an honest peasant, now even thinking of taking the road of feudal landlords. Recently, I attended a representative meeting of mutual aid teams, and I truly realized that the path of simply pursuing wealth is not feasible. In fact, since I thought about purely getting rich and buying land to lease, I have not had peace of mind, and production has not improved. I have only brought suffering upon myself. Now I am determined to turn back and work with everyone to improve the mutual aid team. I want to learn from the high-yield experience of corn production model Han Liuhai together with the team members to increase the yield per unit area; and I want to solve all problems within the team, consolidate the mutual aid team, and lay the foundation for establishing agricultural production cooperatives. I will definitely devote myself wholeheartedly to production and follow the Communist Party.

    认识单纯发家致富的思想是错误的，决心搞好互助组
    编辑同志：我是一个翻身农民，幼年时过着穷苦生活。我的父亲早死，母亲改嫁，丢下我兄弟三人，一个因遭灾卖给了人家，一个死去，只剩下我一个人。从小我就当长工，生活像牛马一样。共产党来后我翻了身。我当长工时，死受活受，积了一点钱买了五亩地。后来实行土地改革，我又分了二亩地，共有了七亩地。我响应共产党的号召，参加了互助组，生活随着生产的提高，一天天上升，我开始摆脱了贫困。可是，就在这时，我产生了错误思想，想着个人发家致富，走错了路。我想多买些地，个人发展生产。于是我把历年积存下的粮食拿出来，前后又买了二十多亩地。这一下我高兴极了。可是我又办错了，地多自己种不了，放到互助组里，大家不愿意给我种这么多，我就把十二亩地出租了。这时我心里非常不安，想着这样我不成了地主了吗？但是，这并没有使我打消自私发财的念头。我仍然想着怎样多收些租钱，怎样置房买地。这一来，生产也没情绪了，结果生产没有搞好。今年城里搞“三反”“五反”运动，我听到而且看到不法资产阶级分子对待我们干部的毒辣手段，痛恨万分。这时，我才想到自己，原是个老实农民，现在也竟想着走封建地主的路。最近我参加了互助组代表会议，我才真正觉悟到单纯追求发家致富的路是不通的。事实上，自从我想着单纯发家致富，买地出租以来，心里也没宁静过，生产也没搞好，真是自找苦吃。现在我决心回过头来，和大家一起搞好互助组。我要和组员们共同学习玉米丰产模范韩六孩的丰产经验，提高单位面积产量；并且要解决组内一切问题，巩固互助组，打下办农业生产合作社的基础。我一定全心全意搞生产，跟着共产党走。
