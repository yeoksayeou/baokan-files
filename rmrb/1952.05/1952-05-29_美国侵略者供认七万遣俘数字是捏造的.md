Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 28th – Recent facts revealed by the American aggressors themselves prove that their unreasonable proposal on April 19th to only repatriate 70,000 of our captured personnel was a shameless fabrication.

    When the U.S. side put forward this absurd and unreasonable plan, according to a Wen Shan dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, a so-called UN Command spokesman, Hickman, claimed on April 25th that this was the result of an "individual investigation" of our captured personnel. Hickman even told the press with feigned seriousness that the U.S. side had conducted "individual investigations" of our captured personnel and had given them "full explanations so that the investigation could be conducted with absolute fairness."

    But the wolf pretending to be a grandmother can't hide its tail after all. The myth concocted by Hickman was quickly exposed. The heroic struggles of our captured personnel in the Koje Island and Busan prisoner-of-war camps exposed the bloody inside story of the American aggressors' so-called "screening" and further proved that the U.S. claim that only 70,000 of our captured personnel were willing to be repatriated was a complete fabrication. Now, even the American aggressors themselves cannot but admit that the so-called "individual investigation" was all lies. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 24th, "American diplomats" revealed how the figure of 70,000 was manufactured. According to these individuals, "in some cases," inquiries were conducted using "loudspeakers"; and "in some other camps, the proportion of prisoners willing or unwilling to be repatriated was roughly estimated." "These individuals said: Not all prisoners in these types of camps were questioned." The Reuters dispatch also revealed: Officials at the U.S. Department of Defense said they did not know the exact number of Communist prisoners of war who had been personally and individually questioned by the UN Command authorities during the screening process, and the UN Command headquarters in Tokyo "may have these figures." Of course, the U.S. side would never dare to reveal another important method of fabricating figures, which is to force our captured personnel to express their unwillingness to be repatriated with bayonets and torture. But even so, it is enough to prove that the U.S. slander that only 70,000 people are willing to be repatriated is a fabricated ghost story that even they themselves cannot find a "basis" for, and it is completely a barbaric fabrication by the U.S. side in order to detain our captured personnel.

    The American aggressors' self-contradictory fabrication is so notorious that even the reactionary American press and news agencies cannot but express their doubts about it now. The "New York Post" on May 21st expressed "real bewilderment" about the "correctness" of the U.S.-proposed figure of only 70,000 so-called "voluntary repatriates" among our captured personnel. The newspaper said that many "UN diplomats" are also "afraid that this is another mess." An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on May 27th also put a big question mark on the so-called "accuracy" of the U.S. screening figures. The dispatch said: "The statement issued by the UN Command in Panmunjom said that the prisoners of war had been screened one by one, and after investigating almost all 169,000 prisoners of war and detained civilians one by one, the resulting figure was 70,000. Now it seems that they were not investigated separately one by one. Therefore, a big question arises: How accurate are the screening figures from the UN Command side?"

    Facts have proven that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening results" fabricated by the American aggressors are not only illegal but also completely fabricated. At a time when a ceasefire agreement is about to be reached, they have fabricated such an absurd plan out of thin air, and its sole purpose is obviously to delay or even disrupt the ceasefire negotiations.

### 美国侵略者供认七万遣俘数字是捏造的

    美国侵略者供认七万遣俘数字是捏造的
    【新华社开城二十八日电】美国侵略者自己最近吐露的一些事实，证明他们在四月十九日提出的只遣返我方七万被俘人员的无理方案，完全是无耻的捏造。
    在美方提出这个荒谬无理的方案时，据美国新闻处汶山电，所谓联合国军发言人希克曼于四月二十五日曾经宣称这是对我方被俘人员进行“个别调查”的结果。希克曼还煞有介事地向报界说，美方向我方被俘人员进行了“个别调查”，还向他们作了“充分的解释，以便调查能进行得绝对公平”。
    可是装作外婆的狼，终究藏不好自己的尾巴。希克曼编造的神话很快就被拆穿了。巨济岛战俘营和釜山战俘营中我方被俘人员的英勇斗争，揭穿了美国侵略者所谓“甄别”的血腥内幕，并且进一步证明了美方所谓对我方被俘人员“调查”结果只有七万人愿意遣返的说法，纯是彻头彻尾的捏造。现在，连美国侵略者自己都不能不承认所谓“个别调查”全是谎话了。据路透社华盛顿二十四日消息，“美国外交人士”透露了七万人的数字是怎样制造出来的。据这些人士说：“在某些情况下”，询问是用“广播器”来进行的；而“在某些其他营场中，则大略地估计愿意或不愿意遣返的俘虏的比例。”“这些人士说：这类营场中的全体俘虏都没有被询问过”。路透社的消息还透露：美国国防部的官员说，他们不知道联合国军当局在甄别中所曾亲自和个别地询问过的共产党战俘的确切数字，而东京联合国军总部也只是“可能有这些数字”。当然，美方决不敢透露美方制造数字的另一种重要的方法，那就是用刺刀和刑具逼着我方被俘人员表示不愿遣返。但是即使这样，也就足够证明美方所谓只有七万人愿意遣返的胡说是连他们自己制造的“根据”都找不出来的，它完全是美方为了扣留我方被俘人员而蛮横捏造的鬼话。
    美国侵略者这种自相矛盾的捏造是如此声名狼藉，以致连美国反动报界和通讯社现在也不能不对它表示怀疑了。五月二十一日的“纽约邮报”即对美方所提出的所谓我方被俘人员“自愿遣返”者只有七万人的数字的“正确性”，发生了“真正的迷惑”。该报说，许多“联合国外交家”，也“害怕这又是一笔糊涂账”。美联社东京二十七日电也对美方甄别数字的所谓“准确性”，加上一个大问号。该电说：“联合国军方面在板门店发表的声明说：战俘已一个个地加以甄别，在一个个地调查了几乎全部十六万九千个战俘和被拘平民之后，这样得出来的数字是七万。现在看来好像并不是一个个分别调查的。因此产生了一个大问题：联合国军方面的甄别数字的准确性如何。”
    事实已经证明，美国侵略者所制造的所谓“自愿遣返”、“甄别结果”也者，不仅是非法的，而且完全是捏造的。他们在停战谈判即可达成协议之际，凭空制造出这么一个荒唐透顶的方案来，其唯一的目的显然在于拖延以至破坏停战谈判。
