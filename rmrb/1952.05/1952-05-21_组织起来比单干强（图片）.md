    (Twenty-two) The cotton harvest of Li Si's small mutual aid team was also not bad, with an average yield of 540 jin of seed cotton per mu. They sold all of it to the state, except for a small portion that they kept for their own use.
    (Twenty-three) They sold a lot of money from the increased production of grain. In addition to donating money for airplanes and cannons, the team also added a Liberation-brand waterwheel and a seven-inch walking plow.
    (Twenty-four) But Wang Quanbao's family, because they withdrew from the mutual aid team, had too few people, couldn't take care of everything, and couldn't pay attention to technology. They also encountered a wind disaster, and the crops failed, not enough to eat. They only harvested a little cotton. His wife complained to him, "It's all your fault."

    （二十二）李四小互助组的棉花收成也不坏，每亩平均收籽花五百四十斤。他们除留下一小部分自用外，全部卖给了国家。
    （二十三）他们增产的粮食卖了很多钱，除捐献了飞机大炮外，组里还添置了一部解放式水车，一张七吋步犁。
    （二十四）可是王全保家呢，因为退出了互助组，人手又少，顾不过来，也无法讲究技术，又碰到一场风灾，庄稼歉收，不够吃。棉花也只收了一点点。老婆埋怨他说：“都是你的过错。”
