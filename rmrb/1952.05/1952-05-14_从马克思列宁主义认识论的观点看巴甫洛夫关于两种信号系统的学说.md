From the Perspective of Marxist-Leninist Epistemology
Pavlov's Theory of Two Signal Systems
by A. G. Spirkin, Soviet Union

    The brilliant scholar Pavlov, through his research on higher nervous activity, laid a solid natural scientific foundation for materialist psychology, established the theoretical cornerstone for progressive Soviet medicine, and further demonstrated and concretized Marxist-Leninist epistemology.

    Pavlov's idea about the form of activity of the cerebral cortex of humans, which is specially developed in the labor process, and which he called the second signal system, is of great significance. The idea of the second signal system, which functions in an inseparable unity with the first signal system, creates a perspective for deeply studying the most complex form of reality reflection—abstract thinking realized on the basis of language—and for studying human speech activity.

    Pavlov's theory of the second signal system (in its interaction with the first signal system) is the foundation of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the direct connection between language and thinking, that is, the theory advocated by Stalin that naked thoughts do not exist, and that the truthfulness of thought is expressed in language.

    The understanding of the unity of the organism and its external conditions of existence is the basic principle of Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity in animals and humans. In the process of life activities, the organism realizes a complex process of interacting with the surrounding world. It is affected by various influences from the external environment. Through the power of the nervous system, the organism makes various appropriate responses to various stimuli: on the one hand, it promotes some stimuli, grasps them, and assimilates them; but on the other hand, it avoids other stimuli in order to get rid of their destructive effects and protect itself.

    Pavlov wrote: "If an animal does not... accurately adapt to the outside world, then it will sooner or later cease to exist. If an animal not only does not tend towards food but instead avoids it, not only does not escape from fire but instead rushes towards it... etc., it will only tend towards destruction." [Note 1]

    The basic concept of Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity is the concept of the reflex, which is the organism's response to the influence of the external environment.

    The reflex is an objective standard in the regular analysis of the nerve processes taking place in the brain of an animal or a person. The processes of the brain that occur and proceed under external influence are not accessible to direct observation, because they cannot be seen or touched. When objective methods of studying these brain processes did not yet exist, people for centuries were predicting in vain: what exactly goes on in a person's brain when he thinks; or what exactly goes on in his brain when an animal acts in such and such a way? Pavlov discarded this prediction and created an objective method of studying this process.

    When Pavlov revealed the basic laws of the brain's work, he explained the development of the brain from lower animals to higher animals, and from higher animals to humans, and also explained the qualitative difference between the activity of the human brain and the activity of the animal brain.

    The organism's reflection of the external world differs in degree of perfection of the nervous system at various stages in the history of the development of the species. In terms of the history of species development, the unconditional reflex is the earliest form of reflection of external influences by organisms with nervous systems. The unconditional reflex is the organism's direct reaction to external influences (objects and phenomena) that have direct biological significance, that is, that can either be grasped by the organism or can cause a harmful, destructive effect.

    The unconditional reflex is an inborn reaction. For example, a chick, as soon as it hatches from its eggshell, immediately begins to peck at the food in front of it.

    At a certain stage in the development of the nervous system, a more complex relationship between the organism and the environment—the activity of the organism's conditioned reflexes—occurs and forms.

    The conditioned reflex—the most perfect form of the organism's adaptation to the conditions of external existence—is united with the organism's unconditional reflexes and is established on the basis of the unconditional reflexes. The characteristic of the conditioned reflex is different from that of the unconditional reflex; it is no longer direct, but indirect. The characteristic of conditioned reflex activity is an objective phenomenon; if it is not an assimilated phenomenon, then it signals the organism, informing it of other phenomena that are important in biology. Pavlov wrote: For the formation of a certain conditioned reflex, it is necessary for the action of the initially neutral motivator to coincide in time with the action of the unconditioned motivator that causes a certain unconditioned reflex.

    All kinds of objects, processes and phenomena in the external world; such as sounds, colors, object forms, object aggregates, time, etc. can perform the function of conditioned signals.

    It is not difficult to believe how significant conditioned signals are to an organism in adapting to the outside world. As is well known, carnivorous beasts live by eating herbivorous animals, and herbivorous animals cannot escape from carnivorous beasts if they do not receive conditioned signals in advance. Pavlov wrote: "It is another matter if a preventive psychological reaction occurs when the enemy is still far away, that is, if it occurs in the presence of its sounds. Weak animals can then escape, hide, and thus preserve their lives." [Note 2]

    Conditioned signals, through the activity of conditioned reflexes, have an indirect biological significance for animals.

    Pavlov defined the system of cortical connections in the brain of an animal under conditional influences as the first signal system. The first signal system reflects the reality in the forms of sensation, perception, representation, preliminary animal thinking, etc. It ensures that animals reflect reality more or less truthfully, on the basis of which they can orient themselves in the surrounding environment.

    The reflective activity of the human brain is qualitatively different from the activity of the animal brain. The activity of the higher nervous system of animals is limited by biological laws. Man is a social being. According to Marx, man is the sum total of social relations. Man's relationship to reality is expressed in his social relations. This relationship is qualitatively different from the relationship between animals.

    Man not only knows reality through personal experience, not only directly, but also indirectly—by applying the experience of the entire human ancestry. This is achieved with the help of language, which occurred and formed in the process of human social activity.

    When studying the role of labor in the transition from ape to man, Engels pointed out the great role of language in the development of the human brain. Labor created man, and it also created his verbal speech.

    "First labor, after labor and with labor, language—these are the two most essential stimuli under the influence of which the brain of the ape gradually transformed into... the brain of man." [Note 3]

    The transformation of the human brain and the formation of a new nerve connection took place simultaneously with the formation of thinking and language in the process of social labor activity.

    In the process of labor, contact, mutual understanding, and a certain harmony between people are necessary. This harmony in joint labor can only be achieved with the help of verbal speech. Language is a product of labor activity and a necessary condition of labor activity. Stalin, explaining the role of language in social development, wrote: "Vocal language is one of the forces in human history that helped people separate themselves from the animal world, unite into societies, develop their thinking, organize social production, fight victoriously against the forces of nature, and achieve all the progress we now possess." [Note 4]

    At a certain stage of historical development, man is able not only to reflect reality when reality affects his sensory organs, but also to react to reality indirectly, that is, through words. When words, as material stimuli, affect the human brain, they cause in the brain an image of the object, which in turn acts as a conditioned signal of an unconditional stimulus.

    Therefore, the second signal system is a complex system of nerve connections that only occurs in the cerebral cortex of humans, and is the basis of human conscious social labor activity. It is the basis for understanding language, understanding active verbal thinking, and understanding speech function.

    The second signal system is the physiological basis of abstract logical thinking and language. The transition to the second signal system was gradually prepared by the previous development of the first signal system. On the basis of the first signal system, human ancestors reflected reality using forms of direct image thinking that already contained a certain degree of generalization.

    The second signal system is formed on the basis of the first signal system, and it enables people to reflect reality in abstract verbal forms of thought, the characteristic of which, in terms of quality, is another higher level of generalization.

    After the second signal system occurs on the basis of the first signal system, it functions in an inseparable unity with the first signal system; this ensures the normal mutual relationship between humans and reality.

    Pavlov always studied these two signal systems in their inseparable unity.

    Whether it is the first signal system or the second signal system, they are nothing more than temporary conditioned connections that occur in the cerebral cortex under the influence of objective stimuli. Objective stimuli (concrete objects and phenomena in the first case, words and language in the second case) perform a foundational function in a certain sense. Although these two signal systems both send signals about some kind of reality, they reflect the existence of reality in various different ways. Pavlov wrote: "It is unreliable to say that there is a special law of nerve activity existing in the second signal system. The difference is only that the function of the first signal system is about concrete phenomena, while the second signal system reflects this phenomenon in a generalized way." [Note 5]

    However, even with their commonalities, the first signal system and the second signal system have qualitative differences.

    Animals only have the first signal system; their brains can only reflect what they see, touch, hear, or have seen, touched, and heard. The image of this object or phenomenon is evoked by a certain conditioned signal.

    Humans have both the first signal system and the second signal system; they are able to reflect in their brains things that they may never have perceived and can never directly sense with their sensory organs. Through words, people can gain knowledge of countries and natural conditions that they have never seen. They can also gain insight into the distant past, and so on.

    The second signal system, unlike the first signal system, does not occur and function under the influence of the concrete objects and phenomena of the external world itself, but under the influence of their agents, that is, words.

    These two signal systems are distinguished from each other by the nature of the objective stimuli that fall into the brain—either concrete objects or their verbal meanings.

    Cortical nerve connections that are based on directly reacting to external objects in the forms of sensation, perception, representation, and direct images constitute the first signal system. And cortical connections that are based on indirectly and generally reflecting the connections existing between objects in the form of abstract verbal thinking constitute the second signal system.

    When studying the question of the first signal system and the second signal system, in order to avoid various complex interpretations of the term "signal," it must be pointed out that Pavlov's application of the term "signal" has nothing in common with the "concept" of signum (symbol). Pavlov does not apply this term in the sense of indication, but in the sense of physiological function, that is, in the sense of notification, explanation, announcement, etc. Pavlov regards the conditioned stimulus, for example, light reflected in the brain in the form of visual sensation of light, as a signal that notifies or sends a signal about the unconditional stimulus, that is, about the stimulus of food, which is repeatedly combined with the stimulus of light at any time.

    The objective connection between the light stimulus and the food stimulus is reflected in the brain in the form of a temporary connection, according to the principles of the first signal system. Therefore, whenever a considerable light stimulus occurs, at the same time in the brain there is a reflection in the form of a sensation, that is, an image of the light stimulus, which, through a temporary connection, evokes the food reaction.

    Words are also a special material stimulus. In human organic life, it also performs the function of a signal, enabling people to determine the orientation of the external world, and notifying and informing them about the existence of some kind of reality, and evoking in their brains the complex cortical connections that reflect the objective connections of the external world. Pavlov wrote: "Of course, for man, a word is also a real conditioned stimulus, just like other stimuli shared by man and animals, but this stimulus is so broad and rich that no other stimulus has it. In this respect, whether from the quantitative or qualitative point of view, it cannot be compared with the conditioned stimuli of animals." [Note 6]

    The reason why the word stimulus is different from the stimulus of objects and things is that the word is a tool for generalizing many other stimuli with which it is connected. Moreover, the word is not only connected to the individual experience of a person, but also to the experience of all the people who speak this language.

    The difference between the word stimulus and the object stimulus is that it itself
    (the word stimulus) is often not the object of research, but only performs the function of a medium between thinking and the object expressed by the word. Although the auditory sense or the retina can directly perceive the word (sound or tracing), and although the auditory or visual image of the word also occurs in his brain, the physical meaning of the word itself is not the object of knowledge, but the object or complex relationship of the object that these words represent. object of knowledge.

    From this, it can be seen that the second signal system enables people to obtain knowledge of reality indirectly, that is, in the process of oral and written communication with other people.

    From this, it can be seen that the first signal system is the material basis of the sensory, direct cognition of the world, the material basis of cognition with sensation, perception, and representation as tools. The second signal system is the bearer of indirect cognition, abstract verbal thinking, and the bearer of human speech activity.

    Pavlov's principle that the verbal system of signalization is the abstraction of reality; that language can generalize; and that thinking is based on the verbalized word is the natural scientific basis of Stalin's theory of the direct connection between language and thinking, that is, "No matter what idea is produced in the human brain, it can only be produced and exist on the basis of the material of language, on the basis of the terms and sentences of language." [Note 7]

    Pavlov pointed out the great significance of words in the formation of abstractions, that is, in abstract concepts. He said that through abstraction, through the characteristic of words that generalize real facts, we can quickly pay attention to the demands of reality and apply these general forms in the practice of life.

    Without abstraction and without generalization, it is impossible for people to gain insight into the essence of things, impossible to reveal the laws of the world, and therefore impossible to know reality.

    Without words, any generalization is meaningless. Lenin wrote: "All words (speech) are already generalized." [Note 8] "Emotions express reality; meanings and words express general things." and continued: "In language, only general things exist." [Note 9]

    Animals can develop very complex conditioned reflexes to human speech, but animals themselves cannot consciously send signals to other animals in the same way as humans. On the contrary, people can talk to others and inform others of the content of their thoughts through the power of language.

    From this, it can be seen that the second signal system, unlike the first signal system, is not only the basis for a generalized reflection of reality, but also the basis for actively influencing others with verbal tools, that is, it is not only the basis for the process of understanding, but also the basis for the process of conveying what has been understood to others.

    The social essence of the second signal system can be explained by its origin (it occurred in the process of social labor) and the role of social life (it ensures the possibility of communication between people). According to Stalin's classic definition, the basic and decisive function of language lies in the fact that it is a tool for communication between people in society, a tool for exchanging ideas. Stalin wrote: "Language is a tool, a weapon, that people use to communicate with each other, exchange ideas, reach mutual understanding, and fight the forces of nature and the struggle for the material wealth necessary for production." [Note 10]

    Without verbal speech, without the brain basis suitable for it (the second signal system), people cannot exchange ideas with each other. The exchange of ideas is of great significance in social life. Stalin wrote: "The exchange of ideas is often extremely necessary, because without the exchange of ideas, it is impossible for people to harmonize their joint activities in the struggle with the forces of nature and in the struggle for the material wealth necessary for production, and it is impossible to succeed in social production activities, and therefore there can be no existence of social production itself." [Note 11]

    Pavlov also emphasized that this idea, that the appearance of the second signal system in the process of human system development, "is evoked by the possibility of greater communication between individuals in the human group." [Note 12]

    Theoretical thinking and all human intellectual activity occur on the basis of the second signal system. "Intellectual work," wrote Pavlov, "is the work of the second signal system or the work of the system obtained when man is transformed into a 'verbal animal'." [Note 13] When elaborating on the thought basis of thinking and language, Pavlov warned that the application of language and verbal thinking itself also hides a danger, which lies in the possibility of separating from reality and entering the realm of fantasy. In order not to break away from reality, not to "break away from reality and play with words," "one should use one's own words to understand reality every minute."

    The second signal system enables people to reflect the external world more deeply, and at the same time ensures the relative independence of thinking, the possibility of the creative combination of images and concepts, and the formation of new connections, which creates the material prerequisites for human purposeful orientation activities.

    Unlike animals, all processes of human practical activity are premised on intellectual activity. Before building anything, people first build it in their minds. Marx said: "At the end of the labor process, the result that already existed in the worker's representation, that is, in the idea, at the beginning of this process is obtained." [Note 14]

    The second signal system not only creates the possibility of human theoretical activity, but also brings fundamental changes to all human practical activities, to the process of his activities themselves, and to the methods of human-made tools that are manufactured and used in this labor activity. People not only have their theoretical and intellectual work, but also transform all complex relationships into the second signal system.

    Pavlov repeatedly pointed out the innovative role of the second signal system. Pavlov wrote: "Man first perceives reality through the first signal system, and then, through the second signal system (words, language, scientific thinking), he becomes the master of reality." [Note 15]

    Pavlov's principle is completely consistent with Stalin's famous principle that consciousness not only reflects the world, but also creates the world, that is, changes and transforms the world.

    The second signal system creates great possibilities for human conscious activity, and ensures the development of science, philosophy, art and technology. This possibility can not only deal with the distant past, but also predict the future.

    "On the one hand, countless stimuli of words enable us to move away from reality, so we should often remember not to distort our relationship with reality. On the other hand, labor, and the words connected with it, make us human." [Note 16]

    Pavlov's theory of the first signal system and the second signal system is based on natural science and demonstrates the foundation of the materialist understanding of cognition. It brings a fatal blow to idealism, and it opens up broad prospects for the deep study of higher forms of reflection—human consciousness.

    Pavlov's theory of the second signal system opens up a smooth path for the study of the natural scientific basis of thinking and language.

    从马克思列宁主义认识论的观点
    看巴甫洛夫关于两种信号系统的学说
    苏联  阿·格·斯彼尔金著
    天才的学者巴甫洛夫以他的高级神经活动底研究，给唯物论的心理学奠定了巩固的自然科学的基础，给进步的苏联医学建立了理论的基石，并且更进一步地论证了和具体化了马克思列宁主义的认识论。
    巴甫洛夫关于人在劳动过程中所特别发生的人的大脑皮质活动形式，即他所称之为第二信号系统的思想，是具有重大意义的。关于那种在和第一信号系统不可分离的统一中发生作用的第二信号系统的思想，对于深刻研究现实反映的最复杂的形式——在语言的基础上所实现的抽象思惟——以及对于研究人底言语活动，都创造了一种远景。
    巴甫洛夫关于第二信号系统的学说（在它和第一信号系统的相互作用上），乃是马克思列宁主义关于语言和思惟直接联系的学说底基础，即斯大林所主张的赤裸裸的思想是不存在的，思想底真实性乃是表现在语言之中的那种学说底基础。
    有机体和它的生存底外界条件统一的认识，乃是巴甫洛夫关于动物和人的高级神经活动学说底基本原理。有机体在生活活动底过程中实现着一种和周围世界发生相互作用的复杂过程。它感受着外界环境各式各样的影响。有机体借着神经系统的力量，对于各种刺激物作着各种适当的答复：一方面它推动着一部分刺激物，它掌握了它们，并加以同化；但在另一方面它却逃避开另一部分刺激物，以便摆脱它们的破坏影响而保护自己。
    巴甫洛夫写道：“如果动物不是……精确地适应外界世界，那么它就要或快或慢地停止生存了。如果动物不但不趋向食物，反而要逃避食物，不但不逃避火，反而向火扑去……等的话，它就只有趋向灭亡。”〔注一〕
    巴甫洛夫关于高级神经活动的学说底基本概念乃是反射的概念，反射乃是有机体对外界环境影响的一种答复。
    反射乃是在动物或人底脑中所进行的神经过程规律分析中的客观标准。在外界影响下所发生和进行的脑的过程，是直接观察所不能达到的事，因为既不能看见它们，也不能触摸到它们。当研究这些脑过程的客观方法还没有的时候，人们几世纪来都在徒劳地预测着：人思考的时候，在他的脑子里究竟进行着什么；或者动物这样或那样地动作的时候，究竟在它的脑里进行着什么呢？巴甫洛夫却将这种预测扔开，而创造了一种研究这种过程底客观方法。
    巴甫洛夫当揭露脑底工作的基本规律时，曾说明了脑之从低级动物到高级动物以及从高级动物到人之间的发展，而且也说明了人脑的活动和动物脑的活动之质的差异。
    动物的机体，在其物种发展史上的各种不同的阶段，具有着各种不同的神经系统的完善程度，而不同地反映着外界世界。无条件反射，就种族发展史上说乃是具有神经系统的有机体对于外界影响的最早的反映形式。无条件反射乃是有机体对于外界影响（对象和现象）的直接的反应，这种外界影响具有直接的生物学的意义，即或者能够为有机体所掌握，或者能够引起一种有害的、破坏的作用来。
    无条件反射乃是与生俱来的一种反应。例如，雏鸡一当从蛋壳里孵化出来之后，就立刻开始啄食它面前的食物。
    在神经系统发展底一定的阶段里，有机体和环境之间的一种更复杂的关系——有机体条件反射底活动就发生和形成了。
    条件反射——有机体对外界存在底条件的适应底最完善的形式，是和有机体底无条件反射联合着的，并且是在无条件反射的基础上建立起来的。条件反射的特征和无条件反射不同，它已非直接的，而是间接的。条件反射活动的特征是一种客观的现象，如果不是一种被同化底现象，那么就向有机体发出信号，把这种在生物学上具有其他重要性的现象通知有机体。巴甫洛夫曾经写道：对于某种条件反射底形成来说，初期的中性动因底作用和引起一定无条件反射的无条件动因底作用之在时间上的符合是必要的。
    外界形形色色的对象、过程和现象；如声音、颜色、对象底形式、对象底总体、时间等等都能够完成条件信号底作用。
    条件信号在有机体适应外界的过程中，究竟具有如何重大的意义是不难令人相信的。如所周知，肉食的猛兽是以食草动物为生的，草食动物如果预先得不到条件的信号时它是不能够逃脱肉食猛兽的。巴甫洛夫写道：“如果还当敌人遥远的时候，即如果是在有了它的声音的场合下，就发生一种预防的心理反应的话，那么就是另外一种情形了。弱小的动物在当时是能脱逃、隐避、即能保全生命的。”〔注二〕
    条件信号通过了条件反射的活动就对动物具有一种间接的生物学上的意义。
    巴甫洛夫将动物在条件影响下脑中所进行的皮质联系底系统确定为第一信号系统。第一信号系以感觉、知觉、表象、初步的动物思惟等等形态反映现实底基础。它保证动物或多或少地真实地反映现实，在这种现实底基础上它们能够在周围的环境中确定方向。
    人脑底反射活动，在质的方面说是和动物脑底活动不同的。动物高级神经系统的活动，是被生物学底规律所限制的。人是社会的生物。依照马克思的话，人是社会关系底总和。人对于现实的关系，是以它的社会关系表现出来的。这种关系在质的方面说是和动物间的关系不相同的。
    人不仅是以个人的经验，不仅是直接地认识现实，而且也间接地——应用整个人类先代底经验的方法来认识现实。这是借着在人类社会活动过程中所发生和形成的语言的帮助而达到的。
    恩格斯当研究劳动在从猿到人转变过程中的作用时，指出了语言在人脑发展中的巨大作用。劳动创造了人，也创造了他的词的言语。
    “首先是劳动，在劳动之后并和劳动一起的是语言——这两者乃是最主要的推动力，在它们的影响下，猿的脑髓才逐渐地变成……人的脑髓。”〔注三〕
    人脑底改造和一种新的神经联系底形成，是与思惟和言语之在社会劳动活动过程中底形成同时一起进行的。
    在劳动底过程中，人和人之间的接触、相互理解、以及一定的调谐都是必要的。这种共同劳动中的调谐是只有借着词的言语的帮助才能够实现的。言语是劳动活动底产物，并且是劳动活动底必要条件。斯大林阐明语言在社会发展上的作用时写道：“有声的语言，在人类历史上是帮助人从动物界划分出来、结合成社会、发展自己的思惟、组织社会生产、与自然力量作胜利的斗争并达到我们现在所有的进步的力量之一。”〔注四〕
    在历史发展一定的阶段里，人不只是在现实影响他的感觉器官时能够反映现实，而且也能够间接地，即能够通过词来反应现实。当那种作为物质的刺激物的词影响人脑时，它在脑中就引起了对象底映象，这种对象底映象从而又作为无条件刺激物底一种条件信号。
    所以第二信号系统，乃是神经联系底一种复杂的系统，它只是在人底大脑皮质中发生的，它是人底有意识的社会劳动活动底基础，它是理解言语、理解主动的词的思惟以及理解言语机能的基础。
    第二信号系统是抽象的逻辑的思惟和言语的生理基础。过渡到第二信号系统乃是由第一信号系统以前的发展逐渐准备出来的。在第一信号系统的基础上，人类底祖先是用已含有某种程度的概括性质的直接形象的思惟形式来反映现实的。
    第二信号系统是在第一信号系统的基础上组成的，它使人用抽象的词的思惟形式来反映现实，其特征就质量上来说，乃是概括底另一种更高级水准。
    第二信号系统在第一信号系统底基础上发生之后，就和第一信号系统在不可分离的统一中发生着作用；这就保证了人和现实之间的正常的相互关系。
    关于这两种信号系统，巴甫洛夫始终是在它们的不可分离的统一中来研究的。
    无论第一信号系统或第二信号系统，都不外是在客观刺激影响下，大脑皮质中所发生的临时的条件联系。客观的刺激物（在第一种情形下是具体的对象和现象，在第二种情形下是词、语言），在一定的意义上说是执行着一种基础的机能。这两种信号系统，虽然关于某种现实存在都发出信号，但却以各种不同的方法反映着现实底存在。巴甫洛夫写道：“要说第二信号系统里面存在着一种神经活动的特别规律，这是不可靠的。其差异只在于第一信号系统的机能，是关于具体的现象，而第二信号系统则概括地反映这种现象。”〔注五〕
    可是，纵使它们有着共同性，但第一信号系统和第二信号系统是具有品质上的差异的。
    动物只有第一信号系统，在它们的脑子里只能反映它们所看到、触到、听到或看过、摸过、听过的东西。这种对象或现象底映象是在以前被某种条件信号所引起来的。
    人是具有第一信号系统和第二信号系统的，他能够在自己的脑里反映他可能从没有感知过的和永远不能以自己的感觉器官来直接感觉的东西。人借着词可以得到他所从未看见过的国家和自然条件的知识。他也可以洞悉遥远的过去的东西等等。
    第二信号系统和第一信号系统不同，它不是在外界具体的对象和现象本身的影响之下而是在它们的代理者，即词的影响之下发生和起作用的。
    这两种信号系统彼此之间是以落到脑子里的客观刺激物——或者是具体的对象或是它们词的意义的性质而区分的。
    那种以感觉、知觉、表象和直接形象底形态直接反应外界对象为基础的皮质的神经联系，就组成了第一信号系统。而那种以抽象的词的思惟底形式间接地和概括地反映对象所存在的联系为基础的皮质联系就组成了第二信号系统。
    当研究关于第一信号系统和第二信号系统的问题时，为了避免对于“信号”这一术语的各种复杂的解释，必需指出，巴甫洛夫应用“信号”这一术语，并没有和符号（signum——符号）的“概念”有任何共同之点。巴甫洛夫不是在指示的意义上应用这一术语，而是在生理机能的意义上，即在通知、说明、通告等的意义上应用这一术语的，条件刺激物，例如，以光的视感觉形态反映在脑里的光，巴甫洛夫就认为是一种信号，这种信号通知或发出关于无条件刺激物，即关于和光的刺激物屡次随时结合在一起的食物的刺激物的信号来。
    光的刺激物和食的刺激物底客观联系，是以暂时联系的形态，按照第一信号系统的原则反映到脑中的。因此无论任何一次只要发生一种相当的光的刺激物作用的时候，同时在脑中就反映着一种感觉底形态即光的刺激物底映象，通过暂时联系，就引起食物的反应来。
    词同样是一种特有的物质的刺激物。它在人的有机底生命中，同样执行着信号的机能，使人确定对外界世界的方针，而通知、告知他关于某种现实底存在，并在他的脑中引起了那种反映外界世界客观联系的复杂的皮质的联系。巴甫洛夫写道：“当然，词对于人来说，正像人与动物所共有的其它刺激物一样，也是一种现实的条件刺激物，但这种刺激物却是那样的广阔与丰富，这是其它任何一种刺激物所没有的。就这一点说，不论从量的方面或质的方面讲，都不能拿它去与动物底那些条件刺激物相比较。”〔注六〕
    词的刺激物之所以和对象的，事物的刺激物不同，就在于词是概括它所联系着的许多其它刺激物的工具。抑又有进者，词不只是和人底个别经验联系着，而且是和所有说这种语言的人民的经验联系着。
    词的刺激物和物体的刺激物的差异在于它本身
    （词的刺激物）常常不是研究底客体，而只是完成思惟和该词所表示的对象之间的一种媒介物的作用。虽然听觉或视网膜能够直接地感知词（响声或模写），虽然在他的脑子里也发生词底听觉或视觉的形象，可是词底物理意义本身，并不是认识底客体，而是这些词所表示着的那种对象，或对象底复杂的关系，认识底客体。
    由此可见，第二信号系统，使人能以间接的方法，即在和其它人们口头的和文字的交际过程中得到现实的知识。
    由此可见，第一信号系统乃是世界底感性的、直接的认识的物质基础，乃是以感觉、知觉、表象为工具的认识底物质基础。第二信号系统乃是间接认识、抽象的词的思惟底负担者，人底言语活动底负担者。
    巴甫洛夫关于信号化底词的系统乃是现实的抽象化；言语能概括化，以及思惟建立在信号化底词的基础上的这些原理为斯大林关于语言和思惟直接联系学说的自然科学基础、即“不论人底头脑中会产生什么样的思想，它只有在语言的材料底基础上、在语言的术语和词句底基础上才能产生和存在”。〔注七〕
    巴甫洛夫指出，词在形成抽象、即在抽象的概念上的巨大的意义。他说借着抽象，借着概括现实事实的词底这种特性，我们可以很快地注意到现实底要求，并且在生活底实践中能应用这些一般的形式。
    没有抽象、没有概括，人就不可能洞察事物底本质，不可能揭露世界底规律，而且也就不可能认识现实。
    没有词，任何的概括都是没有意义的。列宁写道：“所有的词（言语）都是已经概括化了的。”〔注八〕“感情表示真实；意义与词则表示一般的东西。”并且继续地说：“在语言中，只是一般的东西。”〔注九〕
    动物对人底言语能够养成十分复杂的条件反射，可是动物本身，却不能够和人同样地有意识地对其它动物发出信号，相反地，人却能和别人交谈，把自己的思想内容借着语言的力量告知别人。
    由此可见，第二信号系统和第一信号系统不同，它不只是现实之概括的反映的基础，而且也是以词的工具积极影响别人的基础，即它不只是理解过程的基础，而且也是向别人传达所理解的东西的过程的基础。
    第二信号系统底社会本质是可以由它的起源（它发生于社会劳动过程中）和社会生活的作用（它保证人们彼此间交际的可能性）来说明的。根据斯大林的经典的定义，语言底基本的和决定的机能，正在于它是社会上人们彼此之间的交际的工具、交流思想的工具。斯大林写道：“语言是工具、武器，人们利用它来相互交际，交流思想，达到相互了解。”〔注十〕
    没有词的言语，没有适合于它的脑的基础（第二信号系统），人们彼此之间是不能够交流思想的。思想的交流在社会生活中是具有巨大意义的。斯大林写道：“思想的交流是经常极端必要的，因为没有思想的交流，便不可能使人们在与自然力的斗争中，在为生产必需的物质财富的斗争中调协其共同活动，便不可能在社会生产行为中获得成功，因此也就不可能有社会生产本身的存在。”〔注十一〕
    巴甫洛夫同样强调指出，这种思想，即在人的系统发展底过程中第二信号系统底出现，“是被人类集团底个体之间大的交际的可能性所引起来的。”〔注十二〕
    在第二信号系统的基础上发生了理论的思惟，发生了人类所有的智慧的活动。“智慧工作——巴甫洛夫写道——乃是第二信号系统的工作或者是那种当人转化为‘词的动物’的时候所得到的系统的工作。”〔注十三〕当阐发思惟和言语底思惟基础时，巴甫洛夫曾警告道：语言、词的思惟的应用本身也藏匿着一种危险性，这种危险性在于和现实分隔的可能性，在于走入幻想底领域中。为了不脱离现实，不“与现实脱节，而玩弄词句”，“就应当每分钟都要用自己的词理解现实”。
    第二信号系统，能使人更深刻地反映外界世界，同时也保证思惟底相对的独立性，保证形象和概念之创造性的联合底可能性，保证新的联系底形成，而这就为人底有目的方向活动创造了物质的前提。
    人和动物不同，自己实践活动底一切过程是以智慧活动为前提的。在建筑任何东西之前，人在自己的头脑中就先建筑了这种东西。马克思说道：“在劳动过程底终结中，就得到了这种过程开始时在工作者的表象上，即在观念上已经有了的结果。”〔注十四〕
    第二信号系统，不只创造了人的理论活动底可能性，而且给人的所有的实践活动，给他的活动过程的本身，给这种劳动活动制造和使用的人为工具的方法，都带来了根本的变化。人不只有他的理论的、智慧的工作，而且也把所有的复杂的关系转变为第二信号系统。
    巴甫洛夫屡次指出第二信号系统底革新作用。巴甫洛夫写道：“人首先通过第一信号系统来感知现实，其后，他是通过第二信号系统（词、言语、科学的思惟）就成为现实的主人了。”〔注十五〕
    巴甫洛夫这种原理，是完全和斯大林关于意识不只是反映世界，而且也创造世界，即改变、改造世界的有名的原理相吻合的。
    第二信号系统给人的意识活动创造了巨大的可能性，保证了科学、哲学、艺术和技术底发展。这种可能性，不只可以处理遥远的过去，而且也可以预见未来。
    “一方面，词的无数的刺激，使我们能远离开现实，因此我们常常应当记住，不要曲解了我们对现实的关系。另一方面、劳动、以及与它联系着的词却使我们成为人类。”〔注十六〕
    巴甫洛夫关于第一信号系统和第二信号系统的学说，是就自然科学上论证了认识底唯物论理解的基础。它给唯心论带来了致命的打击，它对于反映底高级形式——人底意识的深刻的研究，打开了广阔的远景。
    巴甫洛夫关于第二信号系统的学说，对于思惟和语言的自然科学的基础底研究，开辟了一条顺利的途径。
