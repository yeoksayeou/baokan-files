Column: Striving to Implement Mao Zedong's Literary Line

    For the past three years, I haven't written much, which has often prompted inquiries, both oral and written, from comrades and friends who care about me. I can only respond with gratitude. The objective reasons for my lack of writing are numerous, but none of them are the real reason. The true reason is my detachment from reality and the masses. Now, on the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I will use the spirit of this epoch-making document to examine myself and make a public self-criticism to answer the good intentions of my concerned comrades and friends.

    Chairman Mao wants us writers to go among the masses to absorb nourishment and nurture ourselves. How have I nurtured myself? To thoroughly examine this, I might as well open the box and let everyone see what's inside, what's most lacking, and what urgently needs to be added.

    I. I grew up in the countryside, and before joining the revolution, my family was a declining middle peasant family, so I understood the peasants. This is a fortunate innate condition, I believe.

    II. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War (1938), I served as a district head for forty days, working to mobilize and organize the masses for anti-Japanese self-defense. Later, I joined cultural organizations (newspapers, bookstores) and worked on mass work in the agency's stationed area. During this time (1948), I also worked on land reform for eight months. While I was still in contact with the masses every day, I only saw them in some political situations (mostly meetings), and I didn't see much of their daily lives and daily work.

    In the winter of 1948, I returned to my hometown for the New Year and stayed for two months, visiting neighbors in my village (a total of 52 households) and six relatives. This time, because of historical relationships, the masses provided me with a complete and unreserved account of the changes that had taken place over the past decade. Unfortunately, this area was a border area with no military significance during the Anti-Japanese War, and our local cadres took less care of it, and new forces had not yet grown up well at that time.

    This is all the nourishment I absorbed from the peasant masses before I came to Beijing. The comrades' and friends' views on my writing are that writing about old people and old things is clearer and more detailed, while writing about new people and new things is more vague and rough. This is completely correct, and the reason for this lies in all the nourishment I have. The subjects of my already published works are all about rural affairs. You have to understand what you want to write about. I and the old characters I write about (of course, not those individual real people) worked together in the fields, rested under the same tree, and ate in the same square. I knew everything about their environment, their thoughts and the way of life those thoughts dictated, and their future plans. When one of them was about to speak, I could generally guess what he was going to say—sometimes I could joke with him and say his half-sentence for him or complete it. Since I understood them so well, I could naturally describe them. How can one discover the thoughts and personalities of each person and the whole picture of various relationships between individuals and classes by simply meeting new people at meetings? There are also many gains at the meeting, but only non-literary reports can be written, not literary works, because only certain aspects of the masses' lives can be understood, and not the whole picture. Even these aspects are only concepts, not images. How can we talk about describing them? Outside of meetings, there are naturally some other opportunities for contact, such as connecting and venting grievances during land reform, and visiting model workers in production, but the contact is the same as in meetings, only touching on certain aspects, and the time is very short. It is almost possible to write an impressionistic record of the matter, but it is impossible to write a new complete character that is natural, vivid, and in line with the laws of progress. I am not preparing to write a complete social picture in every work, but people are social animals, and even if you only write about one person, you have to involve several aspects of society, and these aspects are not easy to recognize accurately without a proper understanding of the whole picture around them. When I write about new people and new things, I slightly describe the things that I already have a rough image or an impression of, and I use a few words to explain the things that I have never even had an impression of. Unfortunately, all the images or impressions are too few compared to what is needed. As for the new people and new things that I am absolutely sure of, that I can understand in every aspect like I understand old people and old things, and that I can describe to my heart's content, it can be said that there are even fewer of them. Therefore, when there are both old and new aspects in a work, the new aspects are relatively clumsy.

    During the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, I have always been lacking in nourishment in the aspect of new people and new things. After arriving in Beijing in 1949, the opportunities to contact the masses became even less, and the source became so thin that it almost dried up. In order to save this, I once went down to a factory, but after a month of experimenting, I felt that the road was too unfamiliar, and I wanted to turn back to the familiar road of the countryside. I turned back, and I also went to the countryside, but only for two months. I temporarily returned to Beijing for a meeting, and was dragged down by some unreasonable objective reasons and was unable to return. Therefore, in addition to writing two short things ("Family Heirloom" and "Registration") in three years, the remaining raw materials can no longer be written into something that can give people a new feeling.

    Looking back at my history since the Anti-Japanese War, I can draw such a conclusion: from the actual life of the masses, gradually to completely departing from the actual life of the masses. If I do not completely change the current situation, my writing history will stop from now on. How to change it? I can only review Chairman Mao's words: "It is necessary to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly..." Since coming from the masses, the mass work I have participated in has been short-term or participated in with part of my energy. When doing stationed work, although the time is longer, I consider myself a helper, and the masses and their directly responsible cadres also treat me as a helper. I busy myself with as large a scope as I can help with, and I help for as long as I can. I can pick it up and put it down, and the other party naturally has no obligation or necessity to reveal the overall situation and problems to me at all times. There are also times when I participate wholeheartedly—forty days as a district head, two eight-month land reforms, and one month out of the two months I went to the countryside after arriving in Beijing, were all done with full energy to grasp the overall situation. Unfortunately, the period was too short. The harvest in these short periods has been considerable, otherwise the relatively rough new people and new things would not necessarily be able to be written. The reason is that being responsible and seriously following new characters in doing new things can lead to deeper new impressions, and naturally divide these new impressions into some series, forming some new images (although the time is very short, not complete enough). Recalling what I have written, most of the new parts are from the raw materials obtained from being a district head and doing land reform work. If I could have done that for a long time, I might have already written more and better works? From these experiences and lessons, it is enough to realize that there is no shortcut to guaranteeing that I can write more and better works in the future except to follow Chairman Mao's words, and be determined to change my current situation and return to the masses.

    On this anniversary, I guarantee to immediately eliminate all objective reasons, and go to the masses for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly to absorb nourishment and write works to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.

### 决心到群众中去

专栏：为贯彻执行毛泽东文艺路线而斗争

    决心到群众中去
    赵树理
    我近三年来没有多写东西，常常引起关心我的同志们、朋友们口头的和书面的询问，问得我除了感谢之外无话可答。我之不写作，客观的理由找一百个也有，可是都不算理由；真正的原因只有一个，就是脱离实际、脱离群众。现在趁着毛主席发表“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的十周年纪念，我用他这篇划时代的文件的精神来检查一下自己，作一次公开的检讨，以回答关心我的同志们、朋友们的盛意。
    毛主席要我们写作者到群众中去吸取养料哺养自己，我究竟把我自己哺养得怎么样呢？为了彻底检查起见，我不妨揭开箱子让大家看一看底，看看这箱子里究竟还装着什么，最缺少的是什么，最近急须要进什么货。
    一、我是在农村中长大的，而且在参加革命以前，家庭是个下降的中农，因此摸得着农民的底。这是我自以为幸的先天条件。
    二、抗日初期（一九三八年）我当过四十天区长，作的是动员群众、组织群众抗日自卫的工作。后来参加了文化机构（报社、书店），作过机关驻地的群众工作。在这中间（一九四八年）又作过八个月的土地改革工作。在作这些工作的时候，虽然也还是每日和群众接触，可是只能在一些政治场合上相见（多半是开会），对于他们的日常生活和日常工作方面所见就不多。
    一九四八年冬我回到我的故乡过了个年，住了两个月，逐户访问了本村的邻里（共五十二户），拜访了六户亲属。这一次，因为有历史关系，群众把十年来的情况变化毫无保留地供给我，可惜这地区在抗日时期是个没有军事意义的接敌区，我方的地方干部照顾得较少，新的力量当时还没有很好地成长起来。
    这便是我到北京以前在农民群众中所吸取到的全部养料。同志们、朋友们对我所写的作品的观感是写旧人旧事较明朗，较细致，写新人新事较模糊，较粗糙。完全正确，其所以那样，就决定于这全部养料。我已写出的作品，其题材全部是农村的事。要写什么就得了解什么。我和我写的那些旧人物（自然不是那些个别的真人），到田地里作活在一块作，休息同在一株树下休息，吃饭同在一个广场吃饭；他们每个人的环境、思想和那思想所支配的生活方式、前途打算，我无所不晓；当他们一个人刚要开口说话，我大体上能推测出他要说什么——有时候和他开玩笑，能预先替他说出或接他的下半句话。我既然这样了解他们，自然就能描写他们。对新的人物，大半是在会议时间碰一碰头，如何能发现每一个人的思想性格和各个人各个阶级各种关系的全貌呢？在会场上的收获也不少，可是只能写非文艺性的报告，不能写文艺作品，因为只能了解到群众生活的某些方面，而不能了解到全面，就是这些方面还只有概念，没有形象，如何谈得到描写呢？会议之外，自然也还有些别的接触机会，例如土地改革中的串连诉苦，生产中的访问劳动模范等，但所接触者又和开会一样，都是只接触某一方面，而且时间也很短，就事论事写个印象记还差不多，据以写一个又自然又生动又合乎进步规律的新的完整人物是不行的。我并不是每个作品都准备写社会全面，不过人是社会动物，即使只写一个人也要牵动社会几个方面，而这些方面在对那个周围的全面没有个适当了解之前，就不易认识得准确。我在写新人新事的时候，所要涉及的事，那些在我已有个粗略的形象或已有过个印象的我就略加描写，那些是我连印象也不曾有过的我就用几句话交代过去，可惜是所有的形象或印象比起需要来太少了，至于那绝有把握的、能像我对旧人旧事那样了解得面面俱到、可以尽情描写的新人新事，可以说更少得很，所以在一个作品中同时新旧都有的时候，新的方面便相形见拙。
    在抗日战争和解放战争中，在新人新事这方面，我自己一向就是养料不足的。一九四九年到北京以后，和群众接触的机会更少了，来源更细得几乎断绝了。为了要挽救这一点，我也曾下过一次工厂，但试验了一个月，觉得路子太生，又想折回来走农村的熟路。折回来了，并且也到了农村了，可是仅仅两个月工夫，临时回到北京来开了个会，又被些不成理由的客观原因拖住没有得返回去。所以除了三年之中写了两个短东西（“传家宝”和“登记”）以外，所存的原料再也写不成个能给人以新感觉的东西。
    回顾一下自己从抗日战争以来的历史，可以得出这样个结论：从群众的实际生活中来，渐渐以至于完全脱离群众的实际生活，如不彻底改变一下现状，自己的写作历史是会从此停止的。怎样改变呢？还只有温习毛主席的话：“必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去……”自从从群众中来了以后，所参加的群众工作，是短期地、或分一部分精力参加的。在作驻地工作的时候，虽说时间较长，可是自己以帮忙者自居，群众及其直接负责干部对自己也以帮忙者看待。自己随着方便能帮多么大个范围就忙多么大个范围，能帮多久就帮多久，提得起放得下，对方自然没有把全面的情况和问题时时向自己表露的义务和必要。也有全身心参加的时候——四十天区长，两次八个月的土地改革和到北京以后又到农村去的两个月中的一个月，都是以全副精力掌握了全面情况做的，可惜为期过短。就这短短的时期中，其收获已算不少，否则比较粗糙的新人新事也不见得能写出来。原因是负责认真跟着新人物办新事，能得到较深刻的新印象，并把这些新印象自然分成一些系列，形成一些新的形象
    （虽然为时很短，不够很完整）。回忆一下我所写的东西，其中新的部分，大半是从当区长和作土地改革工作中取得原料的，假如早能长期那样作，可能早已写出较多而较好的作品来了吧？从这些经验教训中也足以体会到除了照着毛主席的话，下决心改变一下自己的现状回到群众中去，是再没有第二个捷径可以保证今后能写出更多而更好的作品来的。
    在这个纪念日，我保证立即排除一切客观的理由，长期地、无条件地、全身心地到群众中去吸取养料，写出作品来，用作品来纪念毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上发表讲话的十周年。
