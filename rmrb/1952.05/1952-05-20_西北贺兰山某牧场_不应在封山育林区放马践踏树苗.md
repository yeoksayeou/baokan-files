    Northwest Helan Mountain Pasture
    Should Not Allow Horses to Trample Seedlings in the Closure for Reforestation Area
    Comrade Editor: The Helan Mountain in Ningxia Province was entirely designated as a closure for reforestation area in January 1951. Except for essential transportation routes such as Suyukou, Sanguan, and Rujigou which are allowed to pass through, all other openings are strictly forbidden. The effect of the closure for reforestation was evident in the spring of last year. For example, the large area of mountain apricots sown in Baimafeng Gully has grown into seedlings of four or five inches, which people are very fond of. However, the comrades who graze horses at a certain pasture in Helan Mountain do not cherish the people's fruit trees, and most of those mountain apricot seedlings were trampled by the herds of horses they released. We have contacted the pasture several times, asking them to strictly control the horses. We have also explained the significance of closure for reforestation to the horse-grazing comrades, asking them not to release horses on the mountain to trample the seedlings again. However, our efforts have not been effective, and they still arbitrarily release horses into the closure area to damage the forest. Last October, the mountain apricots sown by the masses in Zhenmuguan Gully have mostly sprouted, but they have been trampled again by the horse herds of a certain pasture. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the pasture also sent people to burn lime in Suyukou Gully, arbitrarily felling trees. This time, they destroyed more than 500 naturally grown mountain elms. I hope that the leading comrades of the pasture will quickly prevent the recurrence of this erroneous behavior that undermines the policy of closure for reforestation and damages the prestige of the People's Government, and make a self-criticism in the newspaper.

    西北贺兰山某牧场
    不应在封山育林区放马践踏树苗
    编辑同志：宁夏省贺兰山在一九五一年一月全部划为封山育林区，除苏峪口、三关、汝箕沟等交通要道准许通行外，其他各口门一律封禁。封山育林后的效果在去年春天便看出来了。如在白马蜂沟播种的大片山杏已长成四五寸的苗木，人们看了很喜爱。但是贺兰山某牧场的放马同志，不爱护人民的果木，那些山杏苗大部被他们放的马群踏毁了。我们几次和某牧场联系，请他们对马群严加管制；我们又对放马同志解释封山育林的意义，请他们不要再放马上山践踏树苗。但我们这样做并没有生效，他们仍旧任意放马到封山区内破坏林木。去年十月间群众在镇木关沟内播种的山杏，到目前大部已发芽，但是又遭到某牧场马群的践踏。“三反”运动中，某牧场还派人在苏峪口沟内烧石灰，任意砍伐林木。这一次破坏了天然生长的山榆达五百余株。我希望某牧场领导同志赶快防止再发生这种破坏封山育林政策、损害人民政府威信的错误行为，并在报上作检讨。程文鹤
