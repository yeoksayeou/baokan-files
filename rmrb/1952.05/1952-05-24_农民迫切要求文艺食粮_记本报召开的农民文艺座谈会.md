Peasants Eagerly Demand Literary and Artistic Nourishment
    ——A Record of the Farmers’ Literature and Art Symposium Convened by This Newspaper
    On the 20th of this month, this newspaper convened a farmers' literature and art symposium in the suburban areas of Beijing. Eighteen people participated, including activists, enthusiasts, and cultural and educational cadres from thirteen villages in five districts. At the symposium, they reflected on the specific situations of literary and artistic activities in many villages, the main problems that currently exist, expressed many opinions, and put forward their demands and hopes.
    Literary and Artistic Propaganda Plays a Significant Role in Rural Areas
    According to Wang Linjiang of Nanyuan Town, Eleventh District, there are endless moving stories of literary and artistic propaganda activities in rural areas. Some villages have established literature and art groups or village theater troupes. Activists engaged in literary and artistic activities collect local materials, combine them with current movements, compose clappers, perform short plays, and promote propaganda everywhere, "playing a significant role." Zhang Fengshan of Guanxi Village, Fourteenth District, is a well-known clapper artist in the nearby villages. Their village has a total of 427 mu of land, and 257 mu of land were infested with wheat aphids this year. After his propaganda, the masses actively got up to catch insects, catching a total of 4,734 jin of pests. He said, "People in our village like to listen to clappers the most. I incorporated the principles of aphid reproduction into the clappers, breaking the masses' superstitious ideas." His clappers are always closely related to the season and the current situation. He said, "If insects are growing in the field, I'll talk about pests, and everyone will naturally pay attention; if I talk about pests in winter, the masses won't like to listen. In winter, I talk about fertilizer."
    Literary and artistic activities have also been very effective in helping to promote the organization of mutual aid teams. Xiu Fu, deputy head of the Xiaying Village Theater Troupe, Twelfth District, said, "When we were setting up mutual aid teams in our village last year, only ten teams were initially established. The theater troupe, based on the ideological situation in the village at the time, adapted the story of Han Weisen (a strong man in his thirties) who only cared about his own immediate interests and wanted to work alone into a play called 'It's Truly Glorious to Organize,' criticizing his backward thinking. Han Weisen couldn't even lift his head when he saw the play. After the play, the members of the troupe talked to him individually. He eventually joined the mutual aid team and later became an activist." Now, there are already fifty-one mutual aid teams in the entire village, and almost everyone is organized.
    In order to promote the benefits of the Marriage Law, many village theater troupes performed plays such as "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," "The Little Son-in-Law," "Double Satisfaction," and "Marriage Autonomy," which were written by the farmers themselves. After the girls in Siwangfu watched these plays, they no longer blushed and ran away when they heard others talking about their in-laws' families. Now they find their own partners, and their parents no longer spend money on wasteful dowries, leaving the money to buy fertilizer. After Xiaying Village performed "Marriage Autonomy," five new-style weddings soon took place. When women from Huanggu Village marry, they no longer ride in sedan chairs; they are accompanied by the village's Yangge team. One bride even joined the Yangge team and danced with everyone.
    Literary and artistic propaganda combined with political tasks is also very effective, able to enlighten farmers' class consciousness and enhance their hatred of the enemy. In the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda, Nanyuan Town performed the play "Demanding Blood Debt," which was a script published in Northeast China. They changed the dialect and performed it very successfully, with more than 3,000 spectators. Many viewers cried and couldn't lift their heads, everyone hated the American imperialist bandits. The actors also improved their level of awareness after this performance. A female actor who played the main role even ran backstage and cried after the play.
    Rural Literary and Artistic Activities Urgently Need Leadership and Guidance
    These amateur literary and artistic groups in rural areas have gradually grown up under the love and support of the masses. Nanyuan Town established a literary and artistic propaganda group in 1950 to cooperate with the government in banning the Yiguandao sect. At that time, there were only three people, performing some clappers and rhyming storytelling. Now, this propaganda group has expanded to more than 30 people and can write some short plays themselves. In Xiliu Village, Fourteenth District, there are more than 300 households and more than 2,000 people in the village. More than 50 people participate in the theater troupe, half of whom are farmers and half of whom are students in the village. The head of the troupe, Li Decai, is also a farmer. They started organizing a Yangge team in 1949 and changed to performing plays in 1950, performing plays such as "Enemies Without Guns," "Sister-in-Law Liu Captures Spies," "Banning Yiguandao," and "Great Strength Through Organization," which were very popular among the masses. The masses originally liked to listen to clappers, but now they don't like to listen to clappers anymore. Farmers love to watch plays, and actors love to perform them. "Those who listen don't listen enough, and those who sing don't sing enough." They perform from the afternoon until three o'clock in the morning. To meet the needs, they arrange actors in A and B shifts to avoid one person performing continuously, getting tired, and delaying production. After each performance, they hold review meetings to check the work and style of each member. They also do a good job in production and study at the people's school, and all literary and artistic activities are carried out in their spare time. This theater troupe has maintained a good reputation since its establishment. Li Decai said that they perform plays to promote propaganda on the one hand, and also to improve the political and cultural level of the actors on the other. Many people were illiterate when they first joined the theater troupe, but now they can all read newspapers.
    Under the cultivation of the masses themselves, rural literary and artistic activities have begun to sprout. Everyone feels distressed that there is no definite organization to lead them. There is only one cultural center in a district, and only a few villages have a cultural station. The main work of the cultural station is to run people's schools and engage in literacy education. The main cadres of some village governments do not attach importance to literary and artistic propaganda at all. Wu Yongli of Mentou Village, Thirteenth District, said, "No one cares whether you perform or not." Wang Shutian of Tiangezhuang Village, Twelfth District, said, "Our theater troupe seems to have no backing. If the cultural center or the Beijing Literature and Art Office contacted us more often and called us to talk, everyone would feel that the higher authorities care, and their morale would be higher. Now, no one goes to the village for half a year." As a result, some organizations collapsed, and some villages could not get started. Liu Hengbo of Balizhuang, Tenth District, said, "Last winter, we organized a literary and artistic propaganda team and went out to perform 'Glorious Militia,' and we also won an award. We originally wanted to consolidate this literary and artistic propaganda team, but since the establishment of the cultural station in the village, the comrades in the station did not help us, but instead disbanded it." Jin Pu of Haidian Cultural Center said, "We wrote a script based on the production increase facts of Di Guilin, a labor model in the Thirteenth District, called 'Di Guilin,' and sent it to the Beijing Literature and Art Office for review. It's been more than a month now, and it hasn't been returned yet." The lack of funding for amateur literary and artistic groups in rural areas is also a major difficulty in carrying out work. Almost every theater troupe mentioned the need for a curtain, the need for kerosene for performances, and other basic things. Now, the activity funds of these villages are either earned by everyone reclaiming wasteland, planting public land, or engaging in other production; some are donated by the masses, and some are paid out of their own pockets by those who are working. Zhao Yanru said, "Because the masses in our village love to watch plays, they raised money for the theater troupe to buy coal to heat the fire for rehearsals in the winter. A person named Li Wenlong voluntarily paid for the theater troupe to buy a script of 'Xiao Erhei Gets Married.' Last November, the Beijing Suburban Work Committee asked each theater troupe to prepare a budget and fill out a form, saying that some funding could be subsidized. But there has been no news so far." They believe that the propaganda work in rural areas should be led by a unified organization. Otherwise, the district government, cultural center, and police station each do their own thing, and the content is repeated, which is not interesting to farmers; and the literary and artistic propaganda they love is ignored by everyone.
    Young farmers like to dance and want to learn, but no one teaches them. On the evening of May Day, someone went to Tiananmen Square to play, concentrating on memorizing how people danced, getting soaked in the rain, and returned to the village to teach collective dance, enlivening the village's dusk. In some villages, farmers have already learned several simple collective dances, but after a long time, they feel old and cannot meet their requirements. Xiu Fu of Xiaying Village said, "Comrades who are engaged in dance should hurry up and teach us some."
    It is very important for literary and artistic workers to create for the farmers. At the same time, handing over the weapon of literature and art to them and helping them to do it is also what the activists of farmers' literary and artistic activities are eagerly looking forward to. They believe that too few literary and artistic workers go to their midst, almost none. They warmly request guidance and opportunities for observation. They send people to the city to watch a play once, just to learn something, and they can always gain a lot. Even the tunes have been learned. Huang Chengxiang said, "In the past, we didn't know how to do makeup and made the farmers and landlords look almost the same. After listening to the comrades from the Central Academy of Drama talk about makeup once, we understood a lot and solved the problem of makeup." During the "Three-Anti" struggle, the Nanyuan Literary and Artistic Propaganda Team originally wanted to write a one-act play, but they didn't understand the knack of writing plays, so they desperately added materials to it, resulting in a large play. It took a lot of time, but it still couldn't be performed. Wang Shutian of Tiangezhuang Village said, "Although the real people and real events that we wrote are very effective, we can't always do this." The enthusiastic activists of literary and artistic farmers are constantly demanding improvement in their practice; they support Chairman Mao's policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they also expect literary and artistic workers to do more work for them.
    Farmers Demand Movies Go to the Countryside, Demand Short Plays
    For several years, farmers in the suburbs have rarely seen movies, and some have not even seen them. Although Xiaying Village is a key village in the Twelfth District, it has only shown movies three times; the farmers in Nananhe, Thirteenth District, which is relatively remote, have only recently seen the slides "Zhao Yiman" and "Fury on the Yalu River." Even in strong winds, farmers come to see them. People there have not even seen Chairman Mao's photos. When they saw Chairman Mao's image on the slide, they were very happy. The effect of showing movies in rural areas is very great. When the movie "The White-Haired Girl" was shown in Dongbeiwang, Thirteenth District, the masses angrily shouted when they saw Huang Shiren being caught by Dachun: "Shoot him! Shoot him!" Ma Lianxi, a fifty-year-old man in Beiding, Fourteenth District, said, "After the people in our village watched 'The White-Haired Girl' twice, the songs in the movie were widely sung, and even people of my age learned them." They warmly look forward to movies going to the countryside.
    Jin Pu of Haidian Cultural Center said that the Soviet film "Spring in the Countryside" was shown in the town. It would be great if such films could be shown to farmers in the countryside.
    Farmers cannot see movies, nor can they see the dramas of professional literary and artistic groups. They reflect: there are often plays performed in the city to entertain workers, soldiers, and cadres, which is right; but it is not right not to perform them for farmers. They want to perform plays themselves, but they can't find suitable scripts. Wu Yongli of Mentou Village, Thirteenth District, said that people in their village love Pingju opera, but most Pingju opera scripts are very long and difficult to perform, and it takes them twenty days to rehearse them. At the same time, these Pingju opera scripts do not have musical scores printed on them, which is also a shortcoming. Huang Chengxiang said, "The people in our Nanyuan Town Literary and Artistic Propaganda Team feel that the masses' awareness has improved, and their requirements have also increased. We are also busy with our own work and production; but if we don't perform for a month, the masses will ask when we meet 'Why aren't you performing plays yet?' But where can we find the materials? We hope that literary and artistic workers can write more short plays for us." Wang Linjiang also said, "Literary and artistic workers write too little for us, especially too few short plays for us farmers." Zhao Yanru said, "This time, the villagers know that I am here to participate in the symposium and asked me to bring a message, hoping that we can be given more good plays." Farmers are eagerly looking forward to the creation of writers in this way. They require short scripts that are small in form, not five-act, ten-scene large plays that they cannot perform.
    Rural Areas Need a Large Number of Popular Readings
    Farmers also like comic strips and pictorials. They especially like pictures with fresh colors and don't like to read those single-line drawings. But even single-line comic strips are rare in the village. Xiu Fu of Xiaying Village, Twelfth District, said that they have to walk five miles to the cultural station to read books, which takes at least an hour back and forth. In addition to the small number of books and the large number of people, sometimes they have to make an empty trip. Illiterate people are most interested in small books that teach literacy with pictures, which can help them remember new characters. Recently, the Beijing suburbs are vigorously promoting the rapid literacy method. After three months, farmers will be able to read the fourth-grade textbook of the people's school, and at that time, there will be an even greater need for a large number of popular literary and artistic works suitable for them to read. Now, the second-grade students of the people's school are already rushing to the cultural center to read books. Liu Hengbo of Balizhuang made a suggestion to the magazine, saying, "The characters are easy to recognize, but it is difficult to understand the meaning when they are connected into an article." Farmers universally hope that the works they read will be written in a more popular way and that the characters will be printed larger. Everyone also hopes that the blackboard newspaper can be changed to a cartoon newspaper. The current blackboard newspapers are copied from newspapers and are not attractive. Xing Mincai of Huanggu Village, Fourteenth District, said, "When the villagers see long and lengthy arguments on the blackboard newspaper, they feel annoyed by a black mass." They want newspapers and magazines to provide more materials.

    农民迫切要求文艺食粮
    ——记本报召开的农民文艺座谈会
    本月二十日，本报召开了北京市郊区农民文艺座谈会。参加座谈的有五个区十三个村的农民文艺活动积极分子、文艺爱好者和文教干部，共十八人。他们在座谈会上，反映了许多村子的文艺活动的具体情况和目前存在着的主要问题，发表了许多意见，提出了他们的要求和希望。
    文艺宣传在农村中很起作用
    据十一区南苑镇王林江说，农村中文艺宣传活动的动人事实是说不完的。有些村建立了文艺组或村剧团，从事文艺活动的积极分子搜集当地材料，结合当前运动，编快板，演小戏，到处宣传，“挺起作用”。十四区关西庄张凤山，是附近几个村有名的快板能手。他们村里一共有四百二十七亩地，今年有二百五十七亩地生了麦蚜虫。经过他的宣传，群众积极地起来捉虫，共捉了四千七百三十四斤害虫。他说：“我们村里人最喜欢听快板，我在快板里编进了蚜虫繁殖的道理，打破了群众的迷信思想。”他说的快板，总是紧密地结合着季节和当时的情况。他说：“如果地里正长虫，就说害虫，大家自然留心听；要是在冬天也说害虫，群众就不爱听了，冬天我就说关于肥料的事情。”
    文艺活动帮助宣传组织互助组，也收到很大效果。十二区下营村剧团副团长修福说：“我们村里去年搞互助组的时候，最初只成立了十个组。剧团根据当时村里的思想情况，把韩维森（一个三十岁的壮年人）只顾个人眼前利益想单干的事实，编了一出话剧‘组织起来真光荣’，批评他的落后思想。韩维森看到这个戏，头也抬不起来。戏演完以后，剧团的人又个别地跟他谈。他到底参加了互助组，而且后来还成为积极分子。”现在，全村已经有五十一个互助组，差不多全组织起来了。
    为了宣传婚姻法的好处，许多村剧团演出了“小二黑结婚”、“小女婿”、“双满意”和农民自己编写的“婚姻自主”等剧。四王府的女孩子看了这些戏后，听见别人说起婆家，也不红着脸跑掉了。现在她们都是自己找对象，做父母的也不再办浪费金钱的嫁妆，留下钱买肥料了。下营村演完“婚姻自主”，很快就有五对新式结婚的。黄姑坟的妇女出嫁，再也不坐花轿了，伴她们的是村里的秧歌队。有一个新娘子也参加了秧歌队，和大家一起扭。
    结合政治任务的文艺宣传的效果也是很大的，能够启发农民的阶级觉悟、增强他们对敌人的仇恨。南苑镇在抗美援朝的宣传中，演出了话剧“讨还血债”，这是一个东北出版的剧本，他们把方言改了，演得很成功，观众三千多人。好多观众哭得抬不起头来，大家痛恨美帝国主义强盗。演员们经过这次演出后也提高了觉悟程度。有一个演主角的女演员，演完戏以后，还跑进后台大哭一场。
    农村文艺活动迫切需要领导和辅导
    农村中这些业余文艺团体是在群众的热爱、支持下逐渐成长起来的。南苑镇为配合政府取缔一贯道，一九五○年建立了文艺宣传组，当时只有三个人，演出一些快板和数来宝。现在，这个宣传组已经扩大到三十多个人，自己能够编些小戏了。十四区西柳村，全村三百多户，二千多人口，参加剧团的有五十多人，半数是农民，半数是村里的学生，团长李德才也是种地的。一九四九年开始组织了一个秧歌队，一九五○年改演话剧，演了“不拿枪的敌人”、“刘四嫂捉特务”、“取缔一贯道”、“组织起来力量大”等剧，很受群众欢迎。群众原来也喜欢听快板，可是现在一说快板，就不爱听了。农民爱看戏，演员也爱演戏。“听的人听不够，唱的人也唱不够。”下午演起，一直演到夜里下三点。为了适应需要，他们把演员分甲、乙制排演，免得一个人连续演出又疲劳又耽误生产。他们在每次演出后，都要开检讨会，检查每个团员的工作和作风。他们还和群众一样搞好生产，上民校学习，一切文艺活动都在业余时间进行。这个剧团从成立到现在，始终保持了很好的信誉。李德才说，他们演戏一面为了宣传，一面也是为了要提高演员的政治水平和文化水平。开始参加剧团的时候好多人都不识字，现在都能够看报了。
    在群众自己的培植下，农村文艺活动开始萌芽了。大家感觉苦闷的，是没有一定的机关来领导。一个区仅有一个文化馆，几个村才有一个文化站，文化站主要的工作是办民校搞识字教育。有的村政府的主要干部根本不重视文艺宣传。十三区门头村吴永利说：“你演不演，都没人管。”十二区田各庄王书田说：“我们剧团好像没有靠头，要是文化馆或是北京文艺处多和我们联系，召集我们谈谈，大伙儿觉得上级关心，情绪也会高些。现在一年半年也没人到村里去。”因此有的组织垮了，有的村搞不起来。十区八里庄刘恒博说：“去年冬天，我们组织了一个文艺宣传队，出去演‘光荣自卫队’，还得了奖。原想把这个文艺宣传队巩固下来，可是自从村里设立了文化站以后，站里的同志不帮助我们，反而散了。”海甸文化馆金普说：“我们根据十三区劳动模范狄桂林的增产事实，编了一个剧本，就叫‘狄桂林’，送到北京市文艺处审查，到现在一个多月了，还没有退回来。”农村中业余文艺团体没有经费，也是开展工作的一个很大困难。每一剧团差不多都提到了需要一块幕布，需要演出时用的煤油等等起码的东西。现在，这些村的活动经费，有的是大伙儿开荒、种公地或搞其他生产赚来的；有的是群众捐助的，有的是搞工作的人自己掏腰包。赵彦茹说：“我们村的群众因为爱看剧，冬天给剧团凑了钱买煤生火来排戏。有一个叫李文龙的，自愿出钱给剧团买了一本‘小二黑结婚’的剧本。去年十一月北京市郊区工作委员会让各个剧团把预算做好，填了表，说可以补助一些经费。但是至今没有下文。”他们认为农村的宣传工作，应该由一个统一的机构来领导。不然，区政府、文化馆、派出所各搞各的，讲的内容重复，农民不感兴趣；而他们所热爱的文艺宣传，倒是谁也不管。
    青年农民喜欢跳舞，都想学，可是没人教。五一节晚上有人到天安门去玩，专心地默记人家怎么跳的，淋了一身雨，回到村里就教起集体舞来了，活跃了村子里的黄昏。有的村里，农民们已经会跳几种简单的集体舞蹈，但时间长了便又嫌陈旧，不能满足他们的要求。下营村的修福说：“搞舞蹈的同志赶快教给我们一些吧。”
    文艺工作者为农民创作，是很重要的。同时，把文艺这个武器交给他们，帮助他们搞，也是农民文艺活动积极分子急切盼望的。他们认为文艺工作者到他们中间去的太少，几乎没有。他们热烈要求辅导他们和给他们观摩机会。他们派人进城看一回戏，就是为了要学点东西，每次总能够得到不少收获。甚至曲调也学会了。黄成祥说：“过去我们不会化装，把农民和地主化得差不多。听了中央戏剧学院的同志讲过一次化装以后，我们就懂得不少，解决了化装问题。”“三反”斗争中，南苑文艺宣传队原想编一个独幕剧，不懂得编戏的窍门，拚命把材料往上加，结果弄成一个大剧。费了很多时间，还是演不了。田各庄王书田说：“虽然我们编的真人真事很起作用，可不能老是这一套。”爱好文艺的农民积极分子，在不断的实践中要求提高；他们拥护毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方针，也期待着文艺工作者能够为他们多做一点工作。
    农民要求电影下乡，要求供给短剧
    几年以来，郊区的农民很少看电影，甚至有的人还没有看过。下营村虽然是十二区的重点村，也只放映过三次电影；十三区比较偏僻的南安河的农民，直到最近，才看了看幻灯片“赵一曼”和“鸭绿江上的怒火”，刮顶大的风，农民也都来看。那里的人甚至没有见过毛主席的照片，当他们看见了幻灯片上毛主席的像时，高兴极了。电影在农村中放映的效果是非常大的。电影“白毛女”在十三区东北旺放映时，群众看到黄世仁给大春抓住了，都愤怒地喊：“枪毙他！枪毙他！”十四区北顶五十多岁的马连喜说：“我们村子里的人看过两回‘白毛女’以后，影片里的歌子，普遍唱开了，像我这样年纪的人也学会了。”他们热烈地盼望着电影下乡。
    海甸文化馆金普说，苏联影片“山野的春天”在镇上放映过，这样的片子如果能到农村去放映给农民看该多好。
    农民看不到电影，也看不到专业文艺团体的戏剧。他们反映：城里常有招待工人、招待战士、招待干部的戏演出，这是对的；可是不演给农民看，就不应该了。自己想演戏，又找不到合适的剧本。十三区门头村吴永利说：他们村里爱评剧，可是评剧剧本多数很长，很难演，自己排起来要二十来天，希望有短一些的。同时这些评剧剧本都没有印上曲谱，也是一个缺点。黄成祥说：“我们南苑镇文艺宣传组的人，觉得群众觉悟提高了，要求也高了。自己的工作又忙，又要生产；可是一个月不演出，群众见面就问‘为什么还不演戏’，可是，材料到那里找呢？希望文艺工作者多给我们编一些小戏。”王林江也这样说：“文艺工作者给我们写的东西真是太少，特别是为我们农民写的小戏太少。”赵彦茹说：“这次老乡们知道我来参加座谈会，叫我带个信，希望多给我们编些好剧。”农民就是这样迫切地期待着作家们的创作，他们要求形式短小的剧本，不要五幕十场的大戏，他们演不了。
    农村需要大量通俗读物
    农民也挺喜爱连环画和画报。他们特别欢喜颜色新鲜的图画，不爱看那些单线条的画。但是即使单线条的连环画，村子里也很少。十二区下营村的修福说，他们要走五里地上文化站看书，来回起码一小时。加上书少人多，有时还要空跑一趟。不识字的人对看图识字的小本子最发生兴趣，能够帮助他们记住生字。最近，北京市郊区正大力推行速成识字法，三个月以后，农民就能读民校的第四册课本，到那时更需要大量适合他们阅读的通俗文艺作品。现在民校的二年级学生，已经在文化馆抢着要书看了。八里庄刘恒博对刊物提了一个意见，说：“字还好认，就是连成一篇文章，意思就不好懂。”农民普遍地希望要把给他们阅读的作品编得通俗一些，字要印得大些。大家还希望黑板报能够改成漫画报。目前的黑板报照报抄写，不吸引人。十四区黄姑坟的邢敏才说：“老乡们见着黑板报上长篇大论，一片黑，心就烦了。”他们要报纸和刊物多供给些材料。
