    I Love My Profession as a Doctor
    Fu Lianzhang
    I have been a doctor in the revolutionary ranks for twenty-five years. I love my profession and have never thought of changing careers under any difficult circumstances. I like it most when people call me Doctor Fu, which makes me feel particularly responsible for the health of the people. For young people who aspire to study medicine, I often tell them about my experiences, encourage them, and hope that before they study medicine, they will first understand how solemn and important their future responsibilities are.
    Building a new China requires various specialized talents and specialized technical knowledge. As long as technology is combined with revolutionary politics and the needs of the people, all kinds of technology can bring huge benefits to the people. Young people must first establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and then determine a specialized knowledge that they are prepared to study wholeheartedly. Political firmness and excellent skills are the standards for technical talents in the new China. I value technology in any department; but because I am a doctor, I have a responsibility to introduce my experiences in the medical profession to young people.
    In the old society, young people were threatened by unemployment, and many people studied medicine in order to obtain a relatively stable career. Now, in the new China, the era when technology has no place to be used has passed, and young people can learn any specialized technology without worrying about unemployment. The new China needs a large number of engineers, a large number of doctors, and a large number of people's teachers. Universities and specialized schools in various departments are waiting for a large number of young people to enroll. In this way, young people can choose the subjects they want to study according to national needs and their own understanding and interests. But as far as I know, the people urgently need a large number of doctors, and the number of people who aspire to study medicine cannot keep up with this need. Some young people think that medicine itself is very boring, internship dissection is very scary, approaching patients is very unpleasant, and the responsibility for treating people to death is heavy (of course, people should not be treated to death), so they are unwilling to study medicine.
    I started studying medicine in the old society, and my motivation at the time was for personal gain. But the revolution changed my view of the medical profession. The purpose of medicine is to promote human health and happiness, and to help mankind fight against disease. This sacred mission can only be realized in a society where the people are the masters. Before the Great Revolution, I felt that life was very distressing and that the medical profession was very boring. But since 1927, I have changed. During the Nanchang Uprising in 1927, the first batch of revolutionary troops passed through Tingzhou. At that time, I was in charge of a hospital in Tingzhou. They left three hundred wounded in my hospital. I healed these wounded soldiers who shed blood for the revolution, and at the same time healed my own distress. I have since discovered the future of medicine. For twenty-five years, I have been carefully engaged in the revolutionary medical profession, and in the meantime, I have cultivated a strong interest in the medical profession. In fact, if you recognize the importance of the medical profession, the business you are carrying out is beneficial to the people, and you can put your heart into the business itself, then what is so boring about the medical profession? Moreover, medicine is a specialized technology, and it is also a science that integrates many other scientific knowledge. Analyzing the structure of the human body, studying the human life process, studying the roots of diseases, exploring methods of fighting diseases, and mastering the laws of maintaining health; from the study of protein structure to the construction of urban and rural sanitation, every problem requires specialized knowledge to solve. Looking at it this way, what is so boring about medicine? If you think of the names of these medical masters such as Avicenna, Pasteur, Pavlov, and Filatov and their contributions to mankind, then what is so boring about medicine? Discovering the secrets of nature and overcoming disasters requires labor and science, and medicine is one of these sciences that is directly related to human life, so what is so boring about it? Saying that medicine only relies on memory and not on understanding is just a misunderstanding of medical science.
    When I am at the bedside, facing the patient, I will feel the importance of my responsibility and the sacredness of the business I am engaged in. Helping patients overcome the threat of death, helping patients relieve pain, and making fallen patients stand up again, as Bethune said, "restore patients to health and restore strength," isn't this a sacred business? Using my medical technology to cure patients is my greatest pleasure. Being able to help my comrades and my brothers and sisters overcome the pain caused by diseases and restore health will be the most pleasant thing. Moreover, doctors have a more important task, which is to carry out health and epidemic prevention work among the people, the purpose of which is to fundamentally eliminate diseases. This is a huge project. In the face of such a huge project, what is unpleasant? Chairman Mao gave the revolutionary medical and health workers the task of: "Heal the wounded and rescue the dying, and practice revolutionary humanitarianism." Isn't it the most glorious and pleasant thing to fight for this great task indicated by Chairman Mao for a lifetime?
    In the past twenty-five years, I have witnessed many heroes on the revolutionary medical and health front, saving the wounded and sick on the front line and in the rear, they used amazing perseverance and enthusiasm to do everything possible to help the wounded and sick, and never complained. This is because they deeply understand the significance of their work. Under the most difficult conditions, they never lost confidence and never gave up learning. If you say that they are engaged in work with unpleasant mood, who would believe it? It should be explained that the pleasure I am talking about here is the pleasure of serving the people, the pleasure of studying science, and not the "relaxed pleasure" of not being willing to study hard. I think that young people should not choose a career based on this kind of "relaxed pleasure."
    The doctor's responsibility is indeed great, and careless people cannot be doctors. A medical scientist once said: "The anatomy room is the most memorable experience in the medical course. This is the first time that medical students come into contact with 'death', and the first time that he deeply feels the seriousness and greatness of his future duties." This feeling is something that most people who study medicine have experienced. The "fear" of internship dissection that medical students feel in advance will be overcome by this feeling of "seriousness and greatness." There is nothing terrible about autopsy.
    Bethune's requirements for doctors are: "Bold, careful, agile, and loving." If a doctor does not have such valuable qualities in the face of patients, he will not be able to complete his task well. I think that when young people choose a career, it is right to recognize in advance that the doctor's responsibility is great, but it is wrong to avoid choosing a doctor as a career because of the great responsibility. No matter what kind of work you do, if you lack a sense of responsibility or show timidity in the face of responsibility, you cannot succeed. Showing timidity in the face of responsibility is an attitude that young people should not have. Not being afraid of great responsibilities and being willing to take on them is the spirit that young people should have.
    China needs a large number of doctors, but now, the existing number of doctors is far from this number, and the people are looking forward to more young people engaging in the medical profession and taking on the heavy responsibility of the people's medical work. I take great pleasure in being engaged in revolutionary medical work for the rest of my life. I love the weapon of medical technology, and I sincerely hope that more young people will pick up this weapon. I believe that if young people go to the masses and listen to their demands, they will definitely increase their courage to study medicine.

### 我热爱自己的医生职业

    我热爱自己的医生职业
    傅连暲
    我在革命队伍里做医生，已经二十五年了。我热爱自己的职业，在任何困难情况下从未想过改行。我最喜欢人家称呼我为傅医生，这使我特别感觉到我对人民健康所负的责任。对于有志学医的青年，我常常把我的经历告诉他们，鼓励他们，希望他们在学医之前，首先懂得自己未来的责任如何庄严重大。
    建设新中国，需要各种专门人材，需要各种专门技术知识。只要把技术和革命政治结合起来，和人民的需要结合起来，各种技术都能给人民带来巨大的利益。青年首先要确定革命的人生观，然后要确定一门准备专心钻研的专门知识。政治坚定，技术优良，是新中国技术人材的标准。我重视任何部门的技术；但因为我是医生，所以我有责任把自己从事医业的体会，介绍给青年们。
    在旧社会，青年们遭受着失业的威胁，有很多人学医是为了获得比较稳固的职业。现在，在新中国，技术无用武之地的时代已经过去了，青年们可以学习任何一门专门技术，而不必考虑失业问题。新中国需要大批的工程师，大批的医生，大批的人民教师。大学校和专门学校各科各系都在等待着大批的青年升学。这样，青年们就可以根据国家需要和自己的认识、志趣来选择所要进修的学科。但据我所知，人民迫切需要大量医生，而有志于学医的人数却跟不上这个需要。有些青年认为医学本身很枯燥，实习解剖很可怕，接近病人很不愉快，治死人责任重大（当然不应治死人），因而不愿学医。
    我是在旧社会里开始学医的，当时的动机是为了个人的利益。可是革命使我改变了对于医业的看法。医学的目的是为了增进人类的健康和幸福，为了帮助人类同疾病作斗争。这一神圣使命只有在人民作主的社会里才能实现。我在大革命以前，曾经觉得人生很苦恼，觉得医业很枯燥。但是从一九二七年始，我变了。一九二七年南昌起义时，头一批革命军队经过汀州。当时我在汀州一个医院里负责。他们在我的医院里留下了三百个伤员。我把这些为革命流了血的伤员医好，同时也就把自己的苦恼医好了。我从此发现了医学的前途。二十五年来，我谨慎地从事革命的医业，在这中间，培养了我对医业的浓厚兴趣。事实上，如果你认识了医业的重要性，你所执行的业务对人民有益，你对于业务本身又能用心钻研，那么医业还有什么枯燥可言呢？而且，医学是一门专门技术，又是综合了其他好多门科学知识的科学。分析人体的构造，研究人的生命过程，研究病害的根源，探讨和疾病斗争的方法，掌握保持健康的规律；从蛋白质的构造研究起，一直到城市卫生农村卫生的建设，每一个问题都需要专门知识去解决。这样看，医学有什么枯燥可言呢？如果你想起阿维森纳、巴斯德、巴甫洛夫、费拉托夫这些医学大师们的名字和他们对于人类的贡献，那么，医学又有什么枯燥可言呢？发掘自然的秘密，战胜灾害，需要劳动和科学，医学就是这些科学中间的一门和人类生活直接有关的科学，它有什么枯燥可言呢？说医学只靠记忆不靠理解，这只是对于医学科学的误解罢了。
    当我置身于病床之侧，面对病人的时候，我会感觉我的责任的重大和我所从事的业务的神圣。帮助病人战胜死亡的威胁，帮助病人解除痛苦，使倒下的病人重新站立起来，如像白求恩所说的那样，“使病人恢复健康，恢复力量”，这不是很神圣的业务吗？使用我的医疗技术，治好病人，这就是我的最大愉快。能够帮助自己的同志、自己的兄弟姊妹战胜疾病所给予的痛苦，恢复健康，那将是最愉快的。而且医生还有更重要的任务，他要在人民中间进行卫生防疫工作，其目的是根本消灭疾病。这是一个巨大的工程。在这样的巨大工程面前，有什么不愉快呢？毛主席给予革命医药卫生工作人员的任务是：“救死扶伤、实行革命的人道主义。”为了毛主席所指示的这一伟大任务而奋斗一生，难道不是最光荣最愉快的事情吗？
    二十五年来，我目击过革命医药卫生战线上的许多英雄们，在前线，在后方，拯救伤病员，他们以惊人的毅力和热情，想尽一切办法帮助伤病员，从不叫苦。这是因为他们深深懂得自己的工作的意义。在最艰苦困难的条件下，他们也从未失掉过信心，也没有放弃过学习。如果说他们是以不愉快的心情从事工作，那谁会相信呢？应该说明，我这里所说的愉快是为人民服务的愉快，是钻研科学的愉快，而不是什么不肯苦钻的“轻松愉快”。我认为，青年们是不应该从这种“轻松愉快”出发来选择职业的。
    医生的责任确实重大，粗枝大叶的人是不能做医生的。曾有一位医学家这样说过：“解剖室是医学课程里最堪记忆的经验。这是医学生第一次同‘死’接触，第一次使他深深感觉到日后职务的严重和伟大。”这种心情是大多数学医的人都曾有过的。医学生预先感到的实习解剖的“可怕”将被这种“严重和伟大”的感觉所战胜。尸体解剖是没有什么可怕的。
    白求恩对医生的要求是：“大胆、细心、敏捷、慈爱。”医生面临病人，如果不具有这样可贵的品质，就不能很好地完成任务。我认为，青年们在选择职业的时候，预先认识到医生的责任重大是对的，但因责任重大而避免选择医生为职业，则是错误的。无论从事什么工作，如果缺少责任感，或者在责任面前表示畏缩，就不可能成功。在责任面前表示畏缩，是青年所不应有的态度。不怕责任重大，肯于去担负，才是青年应有的气概。
    中国需要大量的医生，而现在，已有的医生距离这个数目还远，人民正期待着更多的青年从事医业，把人民医务工作的重任担当起来。我以终身从事于革命医务工作为极大快慰，我热爱医务技术这个武器，我深愿有更多的青年拿起这个武器。我相信青年们如果到广大群众中去听一听他们的要求，一定会增加学医的勇气的。
