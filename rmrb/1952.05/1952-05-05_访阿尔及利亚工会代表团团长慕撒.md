Visiting Mussa, Head of the Algerian Trade Union Delegation

The Algerian trade union delegation, led by Head Mussa, traveled from distant North Africa to Beijing. On "May Day," they rushed from the airport to Tiananmen Square, but the conference was already coming to an end. This made all thirteen members of the delegation feel regretful. On the evening of "May Day," they braved the rain to watch the mass singing and dancing and fireworks in Tiananmen Square; even sick members of the delegation did not give up this opportunity. Algeria has groaned under the cruel rule of the French colonial authorities for one hundred and twenty-two years, and its people have repeatedly staged armed uprisings and strikes to resist the invaders. Together with the people of the other two North African countries—Morocco and Tunisia—they have been engaged in a difficult national liberation movement. The U.S.-France military agreement signed at the end of 1950 gave U.S. imperialism the privilege of arbitrarily expanding its military preparations in North Africa, and the people of North Africa have suffered further oppression. Therefore, when the Algerian delegation came to the free and happy land of New China, their excitement can be imagined. They were eager to meet the journalists of New China and "pour out their accumulated feelings."

Head Mussa said: "We thank New China for the invitation; this invitation makes us feel extremely honored. Although we only saw the end of the 'May Day' celebration rally, we also felt the warm emotions of the working people of Beijing celebrating their own festival. Tiananmen Square on 'May Day' night in the rain was still full of singing and dancing and joy. The victory of the Chinese people has pointed out the direction for the people of colonies and dependencies, and we are willing to further contact the people of China."

He said: "Before and during the Second World War, China and Algeria stood on the anti-fascist front. At that time, we paid close attention to the developing revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, we became even closer to each other. Your victory is also our victory. Our working people are following the path you have taken." "The political, economic, and cultural development of China has entered a new stage. We are learning from you and are fighting to realize New Democracy. We are constantly fighting against French colonial policies, and in the struggle, we are uniting our neighbors (Note: referring to Morocco and Tunisia). We are fighting for democratic freedom of speech and publication."

Mussa handed us a booklet on the North African national liberation movement. He said: "Since 1945, our struggle has made progress, and our ranks include workers, intellectuals, and scientists." Last year, Algeria established a united front for the national liberation movement with the aim of breaking away from the fate of a colony. It was formed by merging with another youth group and already has its own program of struggle. The communist parties of the three North African countries had earlier proposed the goal of organizing a national anti-imperialist national front. The people of North Africa are uniting more and more closely and are throwing themselves into the anti-imperialist struggle.

Seven hundred thousand people in Algeria signed the Stockholm Appeal to ban atomic bombs, and the signatures requesting the five major powers to conclude a peace pact reached 400,000. Mussa specifically stated that the leadership of the Communist Party and the trade union constitutes the driving force of the united front. He said: "Our struggle is very difficult, and the imperialists' suppression is too fierce." However, when talking about the struggles of the Korean and Vietnamese people, he said that the struggle of the North African people is by no means isolated, and Korea and Vietnam are their direction. "We must learn from experience and look to countries that have already or are in the process of breaking free from their chains." They recognize the truth that "one more nation liberated means one less imperialist base" and firmly believe that the strength of imperialism will be weakened as a result.

The French colonial authorities, at the behest of U.S. imperialism, are carrying out bloody and barbaric suppression of the North African people with troops, tanks, and paratroopers. However, the North African national liberation movement, like an inexhaustible wildfire, is rising unprecedentedly and is integrated with the movement to defend world peace. They unite, regardless of gender, religion, or ethnicity, to carry out the struggle. For example, during a seamen's strike two years ago in February, family members all participated.

Finally, he and the members of the delegation all said: They will bring back news and information about China and tell the Algerian people, because this is a factor that can bring them victory. (Zi Gang)

    访阿尔及利亚工会代表团团长慕撒
    阿尔及利亚工会代表团由慕撒团长率领，从遥远的北非洲赶到北京。他们在“五一”那天，由飞机场匆匆抵达天安门前时，大会已进入尾声了。时间使他们全团十三个人感到遗憾。“五一”当晚，他们冒雨去天安门广场看群众歌舞和焰火，有病的团员也没有放弃这个机会。阿尔及利亚在法国殖民当局残酷统治下呻吟了一百二十二年，那里的人民多少次举行好多次武装起义、罢工反抗侵略者。他们和北非其他两个国家——摩洛哥和突尼斯的人民在一起，一直在进行艰苦的民族解放运动。一九五○年底签订的美法军事协定，使美帝国主义取得任意在北非扩军备战的特权，北非人民遭受了进一步的压迫。因此，当着阿尔及利亚代表团来到自由幸福的新中国的国土上的时候，他们的兴奋心情是可以想像的。他们急于见见新中国的记者们，“一倾积愫”。
    团长慕撒说：“我们感谢新中国的邀请；这邀请使我们感觉光荣万分。我们虽然只见到‘五一’节纪念大会的末尾，但也体会到了北京劳动人民庆祝自己的节日的热烈情绪。雨中的天安门广场‘五一’夜晚仍然是载歌载舞，一片欢欣。中国人民的胜利给殖民地和附属国人民指明了方向，我们愿意进一步地接触中国的人民。”
    他说：“第二次大战前和大战中，中国和阿尔及利亚都站在反法西斯战线上。那时候我们就十分注意发展着的中国人民的革命斗争。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们彼此是更亲切了。你们的胜利也就是我们的胜利。我们的劳动人民正在走你们走过了的道路。”“中国政治、经济、文化的发展走上了新阶段，我们向你们学习，正在为实现新民主主义而斗争。我们不断地和法国的殖民政策作斗争，在斗争中团结着我们的邻居（按：指摩洛哥和突尼斯）。我们争取言论出版的民主自由。”
    慕撒递给我们一本有关北非民族解放运动的小册子。他说：“一九四五年以后，我们的斗争有了进展，我们的队伍包括工人、知识分子和科学工作者。”去年阿尔及利亚建立了以脱离殖民地命运为目的的民族解放运动的统一战线，这是和另一个青年团体合并而成的，已有了自己的斗争纲领。北非三个国家的共产党早提出过组织全国反帝国主义的民族阵线的目标，北非人民越来越紧密地团结起来，投入反帝国主义的斗争。
    阿尔及利亚有七十万人在禁用原子弹的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名也达到了四十万人。慕撒特别说明，共产党和工会的领导构成了统一战线的动力。他说：“我们的斗争是十分困难的，帝国主义者的镇压是太凶了。”但是，谈起朝鲜和越南人民的斗争时，他说，北非人民的斗争绝不是孤立的，朝鲜和越南就是他们的方向。“我们要吸取经验，向已经或正在挣脱锁链的国家看齐。”他们认识到“多一个民族解放，就少一个帝国主义阵地”的真理，并且坚信帝国主义势力将因此被削弱。
    法国殖民当局在美帝国主义的驱使下，以军队、坦克、降落伞部队对北非人民进行血腥的野蛮的镇压。但是，北非的民族解放运动像烧不尽的野火一样，空前地高涨着，而且和保卫世界和平的运动融合在一起了。他们不分性别、宗教和民族，团结在
    一起，进行斗争。例如，前年二月的一次海员罢工，家属们都参加了。
    最后，他和团员们都说：他们将要带回有关中国的见闻和资料，转告阿尔及利亚人民，因为这是可以带给他们胜利的一个因素。（子冈）（附图片）
