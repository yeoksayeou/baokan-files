    Huailai County Yangzhuangzi Village Cadres
    Should Be Punished for Arranging Marriages and Abusing Women
    Comrade Editor: Huang Zhirong, a woman from Junzhuang Village, Wanping County, Hebei Province, and Xu Jinrong (originally from Huiyu Village, Wanping County), from Yangzhuangzi Village, Huailai County, Chahar Province, were married, and Huang Zhirong was often abused. Later, Xu Jinrong died, and Huang Zhirong asked to return to her parents' home, but the Yangzhuangzi Village cadres would not let her leave and forced her to marry Yang Min, a villager in the village. This forced marriage caused very poor feelings between the man and woman, greatly hindering production. Huang Zhirong had asked for a divorce several times, but was stopped by the village cadres. Helpless, Huang Zhirong went to the district government to request a solution. On the way, she was caught up by the village cadres and Yang Min, who beat her severely on the road and then took her home and hung her from the rafters to beat her. After she was injured, she was unable to get out of bed for more than three months. Some village cadres told her, "We would rather you die and leave the village than let you leave the village alive." A village cadre named Yang Guangcai told her, "If Yang Min can't support you, I'll find you another lover to support you together."
    This kind of abuse and insult to women is intolerable. Now, Huang Zhirong's problem has not yet been resolved. I hope the relevant parties will quickly investigate and deal with it. Yang Yukun

    怀来县杨庄子村干部
    包办婚姻虐待妇女应受处分
    编辑同志：河北省宛平县军庄村妇女黄芝荣和察哈尔省怀来县杨庄子村许金荣（原宛平县灰峪村人）结婚后，黄芝荣时常受虐待。后来许金荣死了，黄芝荣要求回娘家，但杨庄子村干部不让她走，并强迫她和该村村民杨敏结了婚。这种强迫婚姻，使男女双方感情很不好，大大地妨碍了生产。黄芝荣曾经几次提出离婚，都被村干部制止了。黄芝荣没奈何，就到区政府要求解决。她走到半路，就被村干部和杨敏赶上，在路上毒打一顿之后，又把她弄回家去，吊在房梁上毒打。她受伤后，三个多月都不能起床。有的村干部对她说：“宁叫你死了出村，决不叫你活着出村。”一个叫杨广才的村干部对她说：“如杨敏养活不了你，我再给你找一个姘头合伙养活你。”
    这种虐待妇女和侮辱妇女的行为，是令人不能容忍的。现在，黄芝荣的问题还没有解决。我希望有关方面，迅速检查处理。　杨玉崑
