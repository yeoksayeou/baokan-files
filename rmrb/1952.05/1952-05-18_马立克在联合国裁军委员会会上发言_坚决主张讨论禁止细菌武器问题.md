Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 17th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting on May 13th. The commission had before it two proposals: one was the Soviet proposal, advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons, reduction of armaments and armed forces, and discussion of the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and punishing those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare; the other was the notorious American proposal, the purpose of which was to justify the actions of the American ruling clique in refusing to prohibit atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and refusing to reduce armaments.

    At the beginning of the meeting, the Kuomintang element, who illegally occupied the position of chairman of the committee, obviously acted on the instructions of his American master, ruling that no delegation may cite the facts of bacteriological warfare or accuse anyone of using bacteriological weapons, and that the materials exposing the American armed forces' conduct of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China should not be distributed as official documents of the United Nations.

    Soviet representative Malik launched a fierce protest against the Kuomintang element's ruling. Malik pointed out that the Kuomintang element's ruling, like his attendance at the committee and his assumption of the chairmanship, was illegal, because he represents no one but the bankrupt Kuomintang adventurer group. Malik pointed out that the ruling violated the United Nations Charter and the rules of procedure of the United Nations. He said: In the meetings of all organs of the United Nations, every representative has the right to cite facts to prove its arguments and proposals. Now there are concrete facts to prove that the American aggressors are using bacteriological weapons prohibited by international conventions in Korea and China. It is precisely these facts that eloquently demonstrate that the United Nations Disarmament Commission should immediately discuss the issue of banning bacteriological weapons.

    Malik said: The Soviet delegation, acting on the instructions of the Soviet government, submitted a concrete proposal, suggesting that the United Nations Disarmament Commission discuss the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and punishing those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare. The United Nations Disarmament Commission not only has the right but also the responsibility to immediately discuss these issues. The attempt of the American representative and the Kuomintang agent to prevent the representatives from citing concrete facts of the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons is aimed at preventing the United Nations from discussing these issues. Only those who conceal the actions of the aggressors and shield those who violate the international agreement prohibiting bacteriological weapons will agree to the illegal ruling of the Kuomintang element. The Soviet delegation opposes this ruling in the most resolute manner.

    The representatives of the American-British bloc, headed by the American representative, voted in favor of this illegal ruling of the Kuomintang element. When voting on the part of the ruling that prohibits the committee from publishing documents exposing the American use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, the representatives of Chile and Pakistan abstained. The Chilean representative explained the reason for his vote, saying: No one has the right to prohibit a delegation from citing facts to support its views, and no one has the right to prohibit them from requesting that the documents they submit be printed as official documents of the United Nations. These are the rights of every delegation.

    The Soviet representative spoke after the vote, protesting this illegal decision. He pointed out that the vote of the American-British bloc once again proves that the American government and the American delegation dare not allow the documents exposing the American armed forces' use of shameful bacteriological weapons in Korea and China to be published in the Disarmament Commission. The Soviet delegation reserves the right to publish these documents in the Disarmament Commission.

    马立克在联合国裁军委员会会上发言
    坚决主张讨论禁止细菌武器问题
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁减军备委员会于五月十三日举行会议。委员会面前有着两个建议：一个是苏联的建议，主张禁止原子武器，裁减军备和武装部队，讨论破坏细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器以及惩办违反细菌战禁令者的问题；另一个是美国的声名狼藉的建议，其目的在为美国统治集团拒绝禁止原子武器、细菌武器及其他大规模毁灭的武器和拒绝裁减军备的行为辩解。
    会议一开始，非法盘据委员会主席地位的国民党分子显然奉了美国主子的指示，即裁决任何代表团均不得引证细菌战的事实或指责任何人使用细菌武器，那些揭露美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的材料都不作为联合国的正式文件散发。
    苏联代表马立克对国民党分子的裁决提出猛烈的抗议。马立克指出：国民党分子这个裁决，正如他出席委员会以及担任主席一样，都是非法的，因为他除了代表已经破产的国民党冒险家集团之外，代表不了任何人。马立克指出这个裁决是违反联合国宪章及联合国议事规则的，他说：在联合国一切机构的会议上，每一个代表都有权利引述事实以证明它的论点和建议。现在有具体的事实足以证明：美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用国际公约所禁止的细菌武器。正是这些事实极其雄辩地说明，联合国裁减军备委员会应当立即讨论禁止细菌武器问题。
    马立克说：苏联代表团根据苏联政府的指示，提出具体提案，建议联合国裁减军备委员会讨论破坏细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器和惩办违反细菌战禁令者的问题。联合国裁减军备委员会不仅有权、而且有责任立即讨论这些问题。美国代表和国民党代理人不让代表们举出美军使用细菌武器的具体事实的企图，其目的就是阻止联合国讨论这些问题。只有掩饰侵略者的行动，庇护违反禁止细菌武器的国际协议者的人，才会同意国民党分子的非法裁决。苏联代表团以最坚决的态度反对这项裁决。
    以美国代表为首的美英集团代表投票赞成国民党分子的这项非法裁决。在表决裁决中关于禁止委员会发表揭发美国在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的文件的那一部分时，智利和巴基斯坦代表弃权。智利代表并说明他的投票原因说：谁也无权禁止一个代表团引证事实来支持自己的见解，无权禁止他们要求把他们提出的文件印发为联合国的官方文件。这些是每一个代表团的权利。
    苏联代表在表决之后发言，抗议这个非法的决定。他指出：美英集团的投票再一次证明，美国政府和美国代表团不敢让揭发美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国使用可耻的细菌武器的文件在裁减军备委员会发表。苏联代表团保留在裁减军备委员会中发表这些文件的权利。
