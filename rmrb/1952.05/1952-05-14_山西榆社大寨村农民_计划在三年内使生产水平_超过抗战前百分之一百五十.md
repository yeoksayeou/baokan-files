To our beloved Chairman Mao:
Our village farmers have been organized for production for ten years. All 53 households in the village have joined mutual aid teams. This year, 42 households have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. Currently, the village's production level has exceeded 52% of pre-war levels. However, we are not satisfied with this achievement. We have set a three-year production and construction goal, which we report to you:

    1.  Within three years, we will ensure that all 53 households in the village participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    2.  We will increase the village's production level to 150% above pre-war levels, striving to reach 200% (pre-war average yield was one *shi* of grain per *mu*).
    3.  We will improve the soil, turning sandy land into fertile fields, and vigorously plant trees to prevent floods, droughts, and wind.
    4.  We will develop animal husbandry. Currently, the village has 126 sheep. Within three years, we will increase this to 330. Donkeys, horses, mules, and cattle will also be greatly developed to accumulate more fertilizer.
    5.  We will strengthen sideline production. We will establish an oil mill, purchase three rubber-wheeled carts, and nine livestock to organize transportation.

We will use these conditions to challenge Li Shunda and the entire county.

Wishing you good health.

Zhang Zhiquan, Labor Model of Dazhai Village, Yushe, Shanxi, and all the farmers in the village.

    山西榆社大寨村农民
    计划在三年内使生产水平  超过抗战前百分之一百五十
    敬爱的毛主席：俺村农民组织起来生产，已有十年历史了。全村五十三户人家全部加入了互助组。到今年，四十二户已参加了农业生产合作社。目前，全村的生产水平已超过抗战前百分之五十二。但我们并不满足这种成绩。我们已定出了三年生产建设的奋斗目标，特向你报告：
    一、三年之内我们要作到全村五十三户农民全部参加农业生产合作社。
    二、要使全村生产水平超过抗战前百分之一百五十，争取达到百分之二百。（抗战前平均每亩实产粮一石）
    三、改良土壤，使沙滩变成良田，大力植树造林，以防洪、防旱、抗风。
    四、发展畜牧业。目前全村有羊一百二十六只，三年之内要发展到三百三十只，驴、马、骡、牛也要大量发展，多积肥。
    五、加强副业生产。要建立油坊一座，置买胶皮大车三辆，牲口九头，组织运输。
    我们要拿这些条件向李顺达应战，并向全县挑战。祝您健康山西榆社大寨村劳动模范张志全及全村农民
