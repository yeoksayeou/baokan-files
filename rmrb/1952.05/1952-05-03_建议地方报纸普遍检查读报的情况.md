    Suggesting a General Review of Newspaper Reading by Local Newspapers
    Comrade Editor: In the past month or so, I have frequently seen letters in the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" column criticizing some cadres in certain organizations for neglecting to read newspapers for study; and the criticized units, under the guidance of the Party newspaper, have mostly made self-criticisms and proposed improvement measures. Facts have proven that this kind of review is very necessary. It not only sounds an alarm for units that neglect cadres' current affairs studies, but it has also aroused the attention of other units, prompting them to automatically review the current affairs study situation of cadres in their own organizations.
    Influenced by the People's Daily, I have seen the China Youth Daily, the People's Railway Daily, and the Hubei Daily, among others, also beginning to review the situation of newspaper reading. I think this is very good. However, many local newspapers have not paid enough attention to this issue. Since the Party newspaper is an important weapon for guiding actual struggle, all cadres should pay close attention to reading it.
    I believe that local newspapers at all levels should cooperate with the local Party and government leading organs to conduct a general review of the newspaper reading situation of cadres in various departments. This will become an effective driving force for strengthening cadres' current affairs studies.

    建议地方报纸普遍检查读报的情况
    编辑同志：近一个多月来，经常看到人民日报“读者来信”栏登载着批评某些机关干部忽视读报学习的来信；而被批评的单位，在党报的指导之下，大半已作了检讨并提改进的办法。事实证明这种检查是十分必要的。它不只向忽视干部时事学习的单位敲了警钟，而且已经引起其他单位的注意，促使他们自动检查本机关干部的时事学习情况。
    在人民日报的影响下，我看见中国青年报、人民铁道报和湖北日报等也都开始了对读报情况的检查，我觉得这是很好的。但有许多地方报纸对这个问题还没有重视起来。党报既然是指导实际斗争的重要武器，所有干部就应该十分注意阅读它。
    我认为各级地方报纸都应协同当地党、政领导机关，对各部门干部的读报情况作一次普遍的检查，它将成为加强干部时事学习的有效的推动力量。
    石决明
