Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th -- Just as the US negotiating representatives were doing their utmost to delay and sabotage the armistice talks at the conference table, US aircraft once again violated the agreement and arrogantly strafed our delegation's supply vehicles.

Around 11:30 AM on May 12th, US aircraft strafed a supply truck of our delegation, clearly marked with red flags, en route from Pyongyang to Kaesong, near Longxian-ri, north of Xingshui. Delegation staff member Li Dongshu was killed by the gunfire. Upon learning of this barbaric act by the US aircraft, people here expressed extreme indignation.

Since the agreement of July 8th last year, that vehicles of the delegations bearing mutually agreed-upon markings would not be attacked, the US side has continuously perpetrated such acts of attacking our delegation's vehicles. Barely two weeks after reaching this agreement, the US side disregarded its obligation and responsibility to strictly abide by the agreement, and on July 21st of last year, dispatched aircraft to illegally attack four of our delegation's transport vehicles in Huangzhou, Sariwon, and other places, despite these vehicles bearing clear markings. Subsequently, such illegal acts by the US side, violating the agreement, occurred one after another. Although our side has repeatedly brought this illegal violence to the attention of the US side and lodged protests, and the US side has repeatedly been forced to admit its mistakes, repeatedly "expressing regret" in words and documents, and feigning repentance, saying such things as "taking every possible step to prevent its recurrence," in reality, the US side has not only failed to handle such incidents responsibly, but similar illegal acts have actually increased. Since the beginning of this year, the illegal acts of US aircraft attacking our delegation's supply convoys have intensified. In January alone, US aircraft attacked our delegation's vehicles twice, on the 3rd and 18th. As recently as April 5th, US military aircraft blatantly disregarded relevant agreements and arrogantly attacked our delegation's supply vehicles, which were clearly marked, in Jianshui-dong, five kilometers north of Xingshui, causing a major incident involving the total destruction of one truck and injuries to nine of our delegation's staff (three of whom were seriously injured). Our side immediately lodged a serious protest with the US side on April 6th regarding this violation of the agreement. However, the perfidious US side has so far failed to provide a responsible response to this incident.

The repeated incidents of the US side violating the agreement show that the purpose of the US side's planned and continuous creation of incidents is to create a tense atmosphere, attempting to disrupt the Korean armistice talks. This latest act of the US side strafing our delegation's supply trucks at low altitude is especially in response to the actions taken by the US negotiating representatives in the conference tent to do their utmost to delay and sabotage the armistice talks. This is one of a series of steps in the grand conspiracy of the US aggressors to disrupt the armistice talks. Since the US side put forward its so-called "final comprehensive solution" on April 28th, the US side has created a series of provocative incidents. US aircraft bombed and strafed our Changcheng prisoner-of-war camp on May 4th and 5th. On May 11th, US aircraft strafed our Jiangdong prisoner-of-war camp again, seriously wounding four US prisoners of war. This not only shows that the US aggressors are slaughtering our captured personnel on a large scale, but also do not care about the safety of the lives of US prisoners of war. It has repeatedly clamored about "morality," "humanity," and "respect for the inherent rights of prisoners of war," but its actual actions are completely untrustworthy, inhuman, and utterly shameless.

The US aggressors have been using their "voluntary repatriation" principle to obstruct the reaching of an agreement in the negotiations. When this principle, which violates the Geneva Convention, was condemned by just world opinion, it was unwilling to abandon the "voluntary repatriation" principle in order to reach an agreement in the armistice talks, and it was also afraid of bearing the blame for disrupting the armistice talks. Therefore, on the one hand, it put forward a final ultimatum-like so-called "final comprehensive solution," and on the other hand, it created a series of provocative incidents to find excuses to disrupt the armistice talks. The Korean and Chinese people warn the US aggressors that these conspiracies of yours are doomed to failure. If you want to disrupt the armistice talks, you can declare it publicly. If you are afraid of the condemnation of the people of the world and all the serious consequences, you must honestly abandon your "final comprehensive solution" and seriously and responsibly deal with the illegal acts of US aircraft strafing our delegation's supply trucks and our prisoner-of-war camps.

### 横暴制造挑衅事件为破坏谈判寻找藉口  美方飞机竟又扫射我代表团车辆  我方代表团工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲

    横暴制造挑衅事件为破坏谈判寻找藉口
    美方飞机竟又扫射我代表团车辆
    我方代表团工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲
    【新华社开城十三日电】正当美方谈判代表在会议桌上尽力拖延和破坏停战谈判的时候，美方飞机竟再一次破坏协议，横暴地扫射我方代表团的供应车辆。
    五月十二日上午十一时三十分左右，美方飞机在兴水以北龙岘里附近对从平壤驶来开城的置有明显红旗标志的我方代表团供应卡车进行低空扫射，我方代表团工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲。此间人士获悉美方飞机这一野蛮暴行，莫不表示万分愤慨。
    自从去年七月八日双方协议置有双方同意的标志的代表团车辆不受袭击以来，美方这种袭击我方代表团车辆的暴行，即不断发生。仅在取得这一协议以后不过两星期，美方即将其应该严格遵守协议的义务和责任置于不顾，竟于去年七月二十一日出动飞机在黄州、沙里院等地非法袭击我方代表团运输车四辆，尽管这些运输车都置有显明的标志。此后，美方这种破坏协议的非法行为接踵而来，层出不穷。尽管我方对美方这种非法暴行曾经多次提起其注意并提出抗议，美方也曾多次被迫认错，在口头上和文件中一再“表示遗憾”，并假意悔改地说什么“正采取每一可能的步骤以防止其再度发生”，但是，实际上美方对此类事件非但未作负责之处理，同类的非法暴行反而有增无减。自从今年以来，美方飞机袭击我方代表团供应车队的非法行为，更有变本加厉之势。仅在一月份，美方飞机就曾在三日和十八日先后两次袭击我方代表团车辆。近在四月五日，美方军用飞机又悍然不顾有关的协议，在兴水以北五公里的剑水洞地方横暴地袭击置有明显标志的我方代表团供应车辆，造成全毁卡车一辆、伤我方代表团工作人员九人（其中三人伤势严重）的重大伤害事件。我方当即在四月六日对此违反协议事件向美方提出严重抗议。但背信弃义的美方对此事件迄今未作出负责的处理。
    历次美方的破坏协议的事件说明，美方有计划地接连制造事件的目的在于制造紧张的空气，企图破坏朝鲜停战谈判。美方这一次低空扫射我方代表团供应卡车的新暴行，尤其是与美方谈判代表在会议帐蓬内所采取的竭力拖延和破坏停战谈判的行动相呼应的。这是美国侵略者企图破坏停战谈判的大阴谋中一系列的步骤之一。自从美方在四月二十八日提出其所谓“最后全盘解决方案”以来，美方即制造一连串的挑衅事件。美方飞机五月四日和五日轰炸与扫射我方昌城俘虏营。五月十一日美机又扫射我方江东俘虏营，重伤美方战俘四人。这不仅说明美国侵略者既大批虐杀我方被俘人员，也丝毫不把美方被俘人员的生命安全放在眼里。它一再叫嚷什么“道义”、“人道”和“尊重战俘天赋的权利”，而其实际行动则是毫无信义，毫无人性，无耻之尤。
    美国侵略者一直拿它的“自愿遣返”原则来阻挠谈判达成协议，当这一违反日内瓦公约的原则遭受全世界公正舆论的唾骂之后，它既不愿放弃“自愿遣返”原则以使停战谈判达成协议，又害怕背上破坏停战谈判的罪名，于是一方面提出最后通牒式的所谓“最后全盘解决方案”，另一方面又制造一连串的挑衅事件，为破坏停战谈判寻找藉口。朝中人民警告美国侵略者，你这些阴谋是注定要失败的。如果你想破坏停战谈判，你公开宣布好了。如果你害怕全世界人民的斥责及一切严重后果，你就必须老老实实地放弃你的“最后全盘解决方案”，并认真负责处理美机扫射我代表团供应卡车和我方俘虏营的违法行为。
