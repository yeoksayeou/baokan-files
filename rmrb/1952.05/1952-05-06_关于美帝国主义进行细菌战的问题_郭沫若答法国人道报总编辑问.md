Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: The Editor-in-Chief of the French Communist Party's newspaper *l'Humanité*, Marcel Cachin, wrote to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, posing questions regarding U.S. imperialism's germ warfare. Guo Moruo replied to Cachin on April 20th. The questions and answers are as follows:

    Question: After the Oslo Conference, is there more evidence regarding America's germ warfare?

    Answer: Yes. This evidence will soon be announced to the world.

    Question: Is America's germ warfare of an experimental nature?

    Answer: Yes, but it is a large-scale experiment. The United States knows that China and Korea will not retaliate with germ bombs, and that fighting in Korea will not affect the United States. However, those conducting the germ warfare experiment did not anticipate: (1) A country where the people are masters has the power to eradicate germ warfare; (2) The conduct of germ warfare has caused the United States to experience a spiritual plague. The current U.S. government is the first to use atomic bombs and germ bombs. In human history, it will receive its due condemnation.

    Question: What are your views on the suggestion of an investigation by the "International Committee of the Red Cross" or the "World Health Organization"?

    Answer: This is merely the instigator of germ warfare wanting to investigate the effects of the experiment. The United States is eager to know the effects of the experiment and has sent special agents to airdrop into the rear of Korea to conduct investigations, who have been captured. Recordings of their confessions will be broadcast worldwide.

    Question: What are your conditions for the selection of the international committee members initiated by the World Peace Council at your suggestion?

    Answer: There are no conditions, as long as they are absolutely fair, just and possess a spirit of self-sacrifice. The people of China and Korea absolutely welcome authoritative figures. Investigating the crimes of germ warfare in China and Korea is an arduous and serious task. One must dare to risk one's life and dare to declare war on violence.

    Question: After the international committee investigates the crimes, what steps should be taken to stop germ warfare?

    Answer: We hope to convene an international conference to condemn American crimes and demand that the U.S. government ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. Among the major powers, only the United States has not ratified this protocol.

    Question: Besides stopping germ warfare, what else should be noted in the cause of peace?

    Answer: Promote universal disarmament and ban atomic weapons. Assist the people of West Germany and Japan in opposing the use of their territory as a base for aggression and rearmament. Develop equal and mutually beneficial international economic relations. Abolish the colonial system. Realize the demand for the five major powers to conclude a "peace pact," signed by over 600 million people.

    关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的问题
    郭沫若答法国人道报总编辑问
    【新华社五日讯】法国共产党机关报人道报总编辑加香写信给中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若，提出关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的问题请他答复，郭沫若已在四月二十日复信给加香，问答如下：
    问：奥斯陆会议后，关于美国进行细菌战是否已有更多的实证？
    答：有。这些实证不久会向全世界公布。
    问：美国进行细菌战是否有实验性质？
    答：是，但乃大规模的实验。美国知道中、朝不会以细菌弹回报，而且在朝鲜作战，波及不到美国。但细菌战实验者没有估计到：（1）人民作了主人的国家，有力量扑灭细菌战；（2）细菌战的进行使美国感受了精神上的瘟疫。美国现政府是原子弹与细菌弹的首先使用者，在人类史上它将获得应分的定谳。
    问：你们对于由“红十字国际委员会”或“世界卫生组织”进行调查的建议的看法如何？
    答：这是细菌战主持者想调查实验的效果而已。美国急于想知道实验的效果，曾经派遣了些特务空降到朝鲜后方，进行调查，已被俘虏。供辞录音将广播于全世界。
    问：由你们建议，由世界和平理事会发动的国际委员会的人选，你们的条件如何？
    答：没有条件，只要是绝对公正而富于自我牺牲精神的权威人士，中朝人民都绝对欢迎。到中朝调查细菌战罪行是艰苦而严重的任务，要敢于冒性命的危险，并要敢于向暴力宣战。
    问：继国际委员会的调查罪行之后，在制止细菌战上有何步骤？
    答：我们希望召开一次国际会议，谴责美国罪行，并要求美国政府批准一九二五年日内瓦禁止使用细菌武器的议定书。在大国中没有批准这项议定书的，就只美国一国。
    问：在制止细菌战之外对和平事业应该注意些什么？
    答：促进普遍裁减军备，禁止原子武器。援助西德和日本人民反对以自己的国土为侵略基地及重新武装的运动。发展平等互惠的国际经济关系。废止殖民地制度。实现由六亿以上的人民所签名的五大国缔结“和平公约”的要求。
