    Soviet Radio Day
    Soviet Union, Danilow
    May 7th is Soviet Radio Day. This Soviet festival of culture, science, and technology was established by the Soviet government in 1945 to commemorate the historic 50th anniversary of the invention of radio.

    On May 7, 1895, the great Russian scientist and physicist, Alexander Popov, presented a report "On the Relationship of Metal Powder to Electric Waves" at a meeting of the Physics Section of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society in Petrograd (now Leningrad). At this conference, he publicly demonstrated his invention – the world's first radio receiver. A few months later, on March 24, 1896, he experimented with his new device, which could transmit radio messages and record Morse code symbols on telegraph tape at a distance of 250 meters.

    Soon, with Popov's help, wireless communication between the city of Kronstadt and ships in distress in the Baltic Sea was successfully established.

    There is now conclusive evidence that two years after this event, the Italian Marconi took advantage of Popov's invention and seized the honor of inventing radio. However, Marconi's deception was later exposed, and the right to the invention of radio was returned to Alexander Popov.

    Humanity inherited a most valuable invention from the famous Russian scientist. He made a great contribution to the development of world science and technology, and he offered people a new and powerful tool for social and cultural exchange.

    One should not forget the solemn and patriotic words of Alexander Popov:
    “I am proud to be a Russian, and if contemporaries do not understand, then perhaps our descendants will understand how great my loyalty to my motherland is, and how happy I am that a new means of communication was invented not in a foreign country, but in Russia.”
    Radio occupies an important and glorious place in the economic, social, and cultural life of the Soviet Union. From the first day of the establishment of Soviet power, Lenin and Stalin paid great and constant attention to the development of radio technology and broadcasting. Lenin, with his genius foresight, called radio a newspaper without paper and without distance. He instructed that no expense should be spared in the production of radio industry and the development of broadcasting, so that the broad masses could hear the speeches, reports, and lectures from Moscow or other central cities.

    All Soviet radio stations are state-owned and serve the people entirely. With the help of Soviet scientists and technicians, Soviet radio stations are equipped with first-class machines. In terms of overall power, Soviet radio stations occupy the first place in the world. Radio stations in various Soviet republics, regions, provinces, and districts broadcast in eighty languages. Radio broadcasts reach the distant Arctic, remote mountain villages, and vast forest areas. Radio broadcasting constantly guides the daily life of the Soviet people.

    Radio broadcasts news from Soviet and international life, telling of the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people who are building communism. For example, Soviet radio stations now broadcast daily the progress of communist construction projects on the Volga, Dnieper, Don, and Amu Darya rivers, as well as the development of Soviet industry and agriculture. Soviet radio stations pay special attention to the creative labor of Soviet workers and peasants, who are diligently building factories and plants, mines and railways, hydropower stations and canals, increasing grain yields, and transforming nature.

    Soviet radio stations are a powerful tool for the promotion of science and culture. Radio stations systematically invite famous scholars, engineers, cultural figures, advanced workers – innovators, agronomists, collective farm members – experts in increasing production, to tell millions of listeners about new achievements in science and technology, and how these achievements are practically applied. These types of broadcasts are very popular with listeners.

    Soviet radio stations are also a valuable tool for disseminating literature, drama, and music. Because the radio station is state-owned, it can broadcast performances from any theater and opera house, and programs from any concert free of charge. In Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Minsk, Tbilisi, Riga, and other cities, just a few of the largest Soviet radio stations broadcast more than forty special music programs every day. Most of these broadcasts are classical music works from Russian and foreign composers, as well as modern Soviet and foreign works. Soviet radio listeners are particularly interested in the masterpieces of Glinka and Beethoven, Mussorgsky and Chopin, Glazunov and Fauré, Borodin and Gounod. The radio station also introduces its listeners to works from Ukraine, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and other republics.

    Folk songs and folk music occupy a special place in broadcasting. Special music is often broadcast according to listeners' requests, thereby familiarizing a wide audience with the excellent songs and musical treasures created by the Soviet people.

    The Soviet radio station's broadcast programs are based on the principle of meeting the needs and interests of all listeners. The radio station also pays great attention to children and young people.

    For young people and children, the radio station organizes literary recitations and broadcasts by writers, scholars, teachers, travelers, and athletes, who can vividly and interestingly tell about the lives of the Soviet people and the people of other countries. The overall goal of these broadcasts is to assist school education and family life in educating the younger generation to be knowledgeable and fond of labor, socially useful, brave and loyal, and infinitely loyal to the great cause of the motherland, the people, and progressive humanity.

    The close connection between Soviet radio stations and listeners is evidenced by the following fact: The Moscow Central Broadcasting Station alone received approximately 200,000 letters last year. These letters contain criticism of the broadcasts, as well as their hopes and requests for the broadcasts.

    The great leaders of the working people, Lenin and Stalin, have repeatedly emphasized that radio broadcasting is of great significance for international communication. The first decree of the Soviet regime – the Decree on Peace – was broadcast via radio.

    In the hands of the Soviet state, radio has become the mouthpiece for spreading truth and progress, and the mouthpiece for propagating the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, which has been consistently implemented since the first day of the establishment of Soviet power.

    Soviet radio stations widely explain the World Peace Council's declaration on the five major powers concluding a peace treaty. It systematically publicizes the Soviet government's proposals for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and broadcasts the countless reactions and angry protests of the Soviet people and people around the world against the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors in Korea and Northeast China. Soviet radio stations consistently support the statements of all organizations and people engaged in maintaining peace.

    With the help of Soviet radio stations, people from all walks of life in the world can learn the truth about the lives of the Soviet people, and the great achievements of the Soviet Union in politics, economics, and culture.

    Soviet radio stations have gained the love and gratitude of millions of people abroad. The Moscow Central Broadcasting Station has received thousands of letters from the working people of the people's democratic countries, as well as the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other countries. These cordial and friendly letters show the great interest of foreign listeners in Soviet life, and their gratitude and support for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy.

    For example, Giuseppe Gabelli from Spezia, Italy, wrote:
    "The broadcasts of Moscow Radio are true, and they are full of love for humanity. They often touch people's hearts, because they are all about peace, about the tireless struggle for peace."

    Irving Scholar, a citizen of New York, wrote to Moscow Radio:
    "When I compare your broadcasts with the propaganda of our local radio stations, I cannot but express my deep gratitude to you, because I have recognized who truly hopes for peace and international cooperation. May you continue to fight for peace in the future. We will do the same here."

    Soviet radio stations serve great and lofty goals. It is a fervent and indomitable defender of peace, freedom, and democracy, and it is a tireless promoter of the most progressive ideas of mankind.

    Following the example of Soviet radio stations, the radio stations of the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia and the German Democratic Republic similarly serve the broad masses of the people, and serve the lofty goals of developing culture and progress, defending world peace, and exposing the war plots of the imperialist aggressors. The radio stations of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are important tools for educating and uniting the people in the struggle for peace, independence, and a new life, achieving great historical victories.

    苏联的无线电节
    苏联  达尼洛夫
    五月七日是苏联的无线电节。这个苏联文化、科学和技术的节日，是苏联政府在一九四五年为纪念无线电发明五十周年这一历史性的日子而规定的。
    一八九五年五月七日，伟大的俄罗斯科学家、物理学家亚历山大·波波夫，在俄国物理化学协会物理学分会彼得格勒（即现在的列宁格勒）会议上，发表了“关于金属粉末对电波的关系”的报告。就在这个大会上，他当众实验了自己的发明——世界上第一架无线电收音机。过了不几个月以后，在一八九六年三月二十四日，他又实验了自己的新装置，借助这个新装置，可以进行无线电发报和在二百五十公尺的距离内在电报带子上纪录莫尔氏电码符号。
    不久，借着波波夫的帮助，喀琅斯塔德城和在波罗的海上遇难的轮船之间的无线电联络，得以顺利地实现。
    在这件事发生的两年以后，意大利人马可尼竟利用波波夫的发明，攫取了发明无线电的荣誉，这一点现在已有确凿的证据。然而，后来马可尼的欺骗被揭穿了，无线电的发明权又重归亚历山大·波波夫。
    人类从著名的俄罗斯科学家手中承继了最宝贵的发明。他给世界科学和技术的发展带来巨大的贡献，他献给人们一种新的有力的社会文化交流工具。
    不应该忘记亚历山大·波波夫说过的庄严的爱国主义的语言：
    “我以生为俄罗斯人而自豪，如果同时代人不懂得，那末也许我们的后代会懂得，我对我的祖国的忠诚是多么伟大，而我又多么庆幸：不是在外国，而是在俄罗斯发明了新的通讯工具。”
    无线电在苏联国家的经济、社会和文化生活中占有重要的和光荣的地位。从苏维埃政权建立的第一天起，列宁和斯大林就对无线电技术和无线电广播事业的发展，予以巨大的和经常的注意。列宁以天才的远见把无线电称为不用纸和没有距离的报纸，他指示在无线电工业的生产上和广播事业的发展上不要吝惜金钱，以使广大的群众能够听到莫斯科或其他中心城市的讲话、报告和讲演。
    苏联的全部无线电台都为国家所有，并完全是为人民服务的。在苏联科学家和技师的帮助下，苏联电台都是以头等机器装备起来的，按其全部力量说来，苏联电台在世界上占首位。在苏联各加盟共和国、边区、省和区的无线电台，用八十种语言进行广播。无线电广播直达辽远的北极、偏僻的山村和大森林地带。无线电广播经常指导着苏联人民的日常生活。
    无线电广播着苏联和国际生活中的新闻，讲述着正在建设共产主义的苏联人民的和平的创造性劳动。例如，苏联电台现在每天都广播在伏尔加河、第聂伯河、顿河和阿姆·达里亚河上的共产主义建设工程的进行情形，和苏联工业和农业的发展情形。苏联电台对苏联工人和农民的创造性劳动特别注意，这些普通人民正埋头苦干地建设工厂和制造厂、矿坑和铁路、水电站和运河，提高谷物收获量，改造大自然。
    苏联电台是科学和文化的强大的宣传工具。电台有计划地邀请著名的学者，工程师，文化人士，先进工人——革新者，农学家，集体农庄庄员——提高产量的能手，向数百万听众讲述关于科学和技术的新成就，和这些成就在实际上如何被应用。这一类的广播备受听众的欢迎。
    苏联无线电台也是传播文学、戏剧和音乐的宝贵工具。由于电台是国有的，它可以免费地转播任何剧院和歌剧院的演出和任何音乐会的节目。仅仅在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、明斯克、第比利斯、里加和其他城市的几个苏联最大的电台，每天就放送四十个以上的特别音乐节目。这些广播音乐大部分是属于俄罗斯和外国的古典音乐作品，也有现代的苏联作品及外国作品。苏联的无线电听众对格林卡和悲多芬、莫索尔格斯基和萧邦、格拉佐诺夫和浮第、鲍罗金和古诺的杰作特别感到兴趣。电台也向自己的听众介绍乌克兰、格鲁吉亚、乌兹别克、塔吉克、哈萨克和其他各加盟共和国的作品。
    民谣和民间歌曲在广播中占有特殊地位。常常根据听众的请求广播特别的音乐，并借此使广大的听众熟习苏联人民所创作的优秀歌曲和音乐宝藏。
    苏联电台的广播节目，是以满足各界听众的需要和兴趣为原则的。电台广播对儿童和青年也极为关怀。
    为了青年和儿童，电台组织文学的朗诵和作家、学者、教师、旅行家、运动家的播讲，他们可以生动地、津津有味地讲述苏联人民和别国人民的生活。这些广播的总目标是，协助学校教育和家庭，把年青一代教育成为有学识的和爱好劳动的，对社会有用的，勇敢和忠诚的，对祖国、人民和进步人类的伟大事业无限忠诚的人。
    苏联无线电台和听众联系之密切，可由下面的事实证明：莫斯科中央广播电台仅去年就接到约二十万封信件。这些信里有对广播的批评，和他们对广播的希望和要求。
    劳动人民的伟大领袖列宁和斯大林不止一次地强调指出，无线电广播对国际联系具有重要意义。通过无线电曾经广播过苏维埃政权的第一批法令之一——和平法令。
    无线电在苏维埃国家手中，就成为宣扬真理和进步的喉舌，成为宣扬苏联和平外交政策的喉舌，这一和平政策，从苏维埃政权成立的第一天起就被始终不渝地执行着。
    苏联电台广泛地解释世界和平理事会关于五大国缔结和平公约的宣言。它有系统地宣传苏联政府对缩减军备和禁止原子武器的建议，广播苏联人民和全世界人民的普遍对美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的无数反应和愤怒抗议。苏联电台一贯地支持一切从事维护和平的组织和人们的言论。
    借助苏联电台，世界各国广大阶层的人民得以知道苏联人民生活的真相，和苏联在政治上经济上和文化上的巨大成就。
    苏联电台获得国外千百万人们的热爱和感激。莫斯科中央广播电台收到成千封的人民民主国家，以及美国、英国、法国、意大利、丹麦、瑞士、印度、越南、印度尼西亚和其他国家的劳动人民寄来的信件。从这些亲热而友爱的信中，可以看出：国外听众对苏联生活的巨大兴趣，和对苏联和平外交政策的感谢与支持。
    举例来说，意大利人朱捷比·加别里从斯培西亚寄信来说：
    “莫斯科电台的广播是真实的，它充满着对人类的爱。它经常触动人们的心，因为它讲的全是关于和平，关于争取和平的不懈斗争的话。”
    纽约市民伊尔文·斯科拉尔向莫斯科电台写道：
    “当我把您们的广播和我们本地电台的宣传相比较时，我不能不对您们深表感激之情，因为我已认清谁是真正地希望和平与国际合作。愿您们今后继续为和平而斗争。我们这里亦当如此。”
    苏联电台为伟大的崇高的目标而服务。它是热烈的和不屈不挠的和平、自由与民主的捍卫者，它是人类最进步思想的不懈不休的宣传者。
    按照苏联电台的榜样，欧亚各人民民主国家和德意志民主共和国的电台，同样地为广大人民服务，并且为了发展文化和进步、保卫世界和平，揭露帝国主义侵略者的战争阴谋的崇高目的而服务。中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的电台，是教育和团结人民在争取和平、独立和新生活的斗争中获得伟大的历史性胜利的重要工具。
