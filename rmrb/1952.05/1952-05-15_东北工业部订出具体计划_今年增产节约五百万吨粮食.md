Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: The Northeast People's Government Industrial Department was the first to respond to Chairman Gao Gang's call for all state-owned and public factory and mine workers to increase production and save eight million tons of grain this year. It has formulated a specific plan for increasing production and saving. According to this plan, the factories and mines under the department will increase production and save wealth equivalent to five million tons of grain for the country this year.

The industrial department’s plan for increasing production and saving this year is based on the state production plan and capital construction plan, which have been greatly improved compared with last year. This year, the department's planned total output value will increase by 33 percent compared with the actual level achieved in 1951, costs will be reduced by 6 percent, capital turnover will be shortened by an average of 50 days, and quality indicators will also be generally improved. The total amount of engineering work in this year's capital construction plan is 130 percent higher than in 1951. The industrial department has decided to strive to exceed the plan by 6 percent in production this year, reduce production costs by 4 percent compared with the plan, and reduce costs by 15 percent in the design and construction of capital construction.

The Industrial Department has formulated methods to complete the 1952 production plan, capital construction plan, and production increase and savings plan. First, the Industrial Department has decided to launch a general discussion of the plan among the workers of all factories and mines in the near future, requiring all factories, mines, workshops, construction sites, and teams to formulate specific goals for overfulfilling the state plan for increasing production and saving after discussion, and to formulate technical and organizational measures plans to achieve these goals. The second is to discover and promote various advanced experiences and carry out mass movements to find "tricks." This is the basic method for the Industrial Department to overfulfill the state plan and increase production and savings tasks this year. The Industrial Department has decided to seriously summarize the advanced experiences in its own enterprises while discussing the plan in various enterprises, summarize the experience of last year's mass movements to tap potential and find "tricks," especially summarize the advanced experiences with great political and economic significance, such as the rapid drilling method in drilling work, the parallel operation method in the construction of vertical shafts, the Su Changyou bricklaying method and Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line operation method in civil construction, the experience of organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts in the mechanical manufacturing industry and high-speed cutting, multi-tool multi-edge cutting method, rapid cooking and rapid papermaking experience in the papermaking industry, the 1951 weaving method and Hao Jianxiu work method in the textile industry, and the rapid maintenance experience in power management work.

    东北工业部订出具体计划
    今年增产节约五百万吨粮食
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北人民政府工业部首先响应高岗主席关于国营和公营厂矿全体职工今年增产节约八百万吨粮食的号召。订出了具体的增产节约计划。根据这一计划，该部所属各厂矿今年将为国家增产节约五百万吨粮食的财富。
    工业部今年所制订的增产节约计划，是在比去年大为提高的国家生产计划和基本建设计划的基础上提出的。今年该部计划的生产总值比一九五一年实际达到的水平增长百分之三十三，成本降低百分之六，资金周转平均缩短五十天，质量指标也普遍提高。今年的基本建设施工计划的工程总量比一九五一年提高百分之一百三十。工业部决定在生产上今年争取超过计划百分之六；生产成本比计划降低百分之四；基本建设的设计和施工中降低成本百分之十五。
    工业部订出了完成一九五二年的生产计划、基本建设计划以及增产节约计划的办法。首先，工业部决定在最近开始发动各厂矿职工普遍讨论计划，要求所有厂矿、车间、工地及班组，经过讨论后，订出超额完成国家计划的增产节约具体目标，并拟定实现这个目标的技术组织措施计划。其次是发现和推广各种先进经验，开展群众性的找“窍门”运动。这是工业部今年超额完成国家计划和增产节约任务的基本方法。工业部决定在各企业讨论计划同时，就要认真地总结本企业中的先进经验，总结去年的群众性的挖潜力、找“窍门”运动的经验，特别是总结带有巨大政治、经济意义的先进经验，如钻探工作的快速钻进法，建设竖井中的平行作业法，土木建筑中的苏长有砌砖法、谢万福木工流水作业法，机械制造工业中的按指示图表组织有节奏生产的经验和高速切削、多刀多刃切削法，造纸工业中的快速蒸煮、快速抄纸经验，纺织工业中的一九五一织布法、郝建秀工作法，电业管理工作中的快速检修经验等。
