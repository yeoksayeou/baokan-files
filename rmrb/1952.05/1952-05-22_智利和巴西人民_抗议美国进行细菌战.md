Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo: The people of Chile and Brazil are angrily denouncing the crimes of the US aggressors in using bacteriological weapons.

According to the Chilean "Democracia" newspaper, the Executive Committee of the Chilean Workers' Federation has lodged a protest with the US Ambassador in Santiago. The protest states: "The Executive Committee of the Chilean Workers' Federation angrily protests to the US government's ambassador regarding the despicable actions of the US armed forces against the people of Korea and China. These heinous crimes against humanity surpass even the atrocities of the fascists in the last war. Now, all of humanity understands why the United States has systematically refused to sign the international convention banning bacteriological weapons, in violation of fundamental principles of humanitarianism." The Executive Committee firmly stated that "it will work with workers and democrats in all countries to ensure that the perpetrators of the crimes committed by the US armed forces fighting in Korea under the UN flag are punished."

According to "Brazilian News Agency" reports: Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Fialho, Congressman Virgil, and other prominent judges, lawyers, and journalists jointly issued a statement protesting against the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States. The statement points out: The United States' use of bacteriological weapons against the people of Korea and China is an attempt to test the results of its laboratory work, which the United States has been conducting for a long time. Prominent American military and political figures have publicly declared their intention to use bacteriological weapons. The statement points out: These facts cannot be ignored by any well-meaning people who hope for peace. The statement demands that all countries, especially the United States, which has not ratified the Geneva Protocol banning bacteriological weapons, must sign, ratify, and abide by the protocol. The statement concludes: "Public opinion and appropriate courts must declare all those who use such heinous weapons as war criminals. We are convinced that we are expressing the sentiments of all Brazilians. In order to stop this bloody crime that has already begun, we call on all the people of our country to condemn the use of bacteriological weapons. If we do not all come out to defend the innocent and demand an end to bacteriological warfare, this destructive force, which threatens all of humanity today, will have no restraints tomorrow. We condemn bacteriological warfare, and we support the noblest cause—the survival of all humanity and the right to respect for human dignity."

The famous Brazilian criminologist Merier also issued a special statement, denouncing the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States military. The statement said: Brazilian legal professionals, in accordance with world public opinion, protest and demand a stop to the actions of criminals "at the instigation of those who are profiting from the war."

According to "People's News," many mass leaders in Marigliani and other cities in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, are protesting against bacteriological warfare.

    智利和巴西人民
    抗议美国进行细菌战
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚讯：智利和巴西的人民都愤怒地斥责美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行。
    据智利“民主报”消息，智利劳工联合会执行委员会已向驻圣地牙哥的美国大使提出抗议。抗议说：“智利劳工联合会执行委员会愤怒地向美国政府的大使抗议美国武装部队对朝鲜和中国人民的卑劣行为。这些反人类的恶毒罪行比上次大战中法西斯的暴行有过之而无不及。现在全人类都已洞悉，美国为什么违背人道主义的基本原则而有计划地拒绝签署禁用细菌武器的国际公约。”执行委员会坚决表示，“要与世界各国的工人和民主人士共同努力，使那些在联合国旗帜下在朝鲜作战的美国武装部队所犯罪行的祸首受到惩罚”。
    另据“巴西通讯社”报道：巴西最高法院法官费阿洛、国会议员维尔戈尔等以及其他著名法官、律师、记者多人联名发表声明，抗议美国使用细菌武器。声明指出：美国对朝鲜和中国人民使用细菌武器是想考核其实验室工作的结果，这种实验工作美国曾长期进行，显要的美国军政界人物曾公开宣布他们打算使用细菌武器的意图。声明指出：这些事实，是任何希望和平的善良人民所不能忽视的，声明要求一切国家，特别是未批准禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书的美国，必须签署、批准和遵守该议定书。声明最后说：“舆论界和适当的法庭必须宣告一切使用这种恶毒武器者为战争罪犯。我们深信我们正表达全体巴西人的心意。为了制止这种已经开始的血腥罪行，我们号召我国全体人民谴责使用细菌武器。如果我们大家都不出来保卫无辜的人并要求停止细菌战，这个今天威胁着全人类的破坏力量，明天就将没有任何约束。我们谴责细菌战，我们拥护最崇高的事业——全人类的生存和人格受尊重的权利。”
    巴西著名犯罪学家梅里埃也发表特别声明，斥责美国军队使用细菌武器。声明说：巴西的法律工作者与世界舆论一致抗议，要求制止“在发战争财的人们唆使下”的罪犯们的行动。
    据“人民报”消息，巴西圣保罗省的马利格里亚和其它城市的许多群众领袖都抗议细菌战。
