International Brief Commentary

    The Brutal Acts of the French Pinay Government Must Be Stopped

    Following the illegal arrest of French Communist Party Central Committee member and "l'Humanité" editor, Stie, the French traitorous Pinay government brazenly arrested French Communist Party Central Secretary and National Assembly member, Duclos, and over seven hundred patriots on the 28th of this month. It also ordered the closure of progressive labor unions and the detention of progressive newspapers such as "l'Humanité," in an attempt to suppress the French people's protest demonstrations against Ridgway's arrival in Paris to command the North Atlantic aggressor forces. The Pinay government's brutal persecution of the French people and their leaders is extremely absurd and reckless.

    The French people are suffering under the oppression of American imperialism and French reactionaries, living in extreme misery; their hatred of American imperialism is extremely deep. Therefore, when the American executioner Ridgway arrived in Paris, the French people responded to the call of the French Communist Party, and despite the reactionary police's terroristic suppression, launched widespread protest demonstrations to express their will to defend peace, independence, and freedom. This patriotic and heroic action of the French people greatly embarrassed the American and French reactionaries, and they were enraged into taking bloody reactionary measures to cruelly persecute the French people and their beloved leaders. The despicable act of the French reactionaries in arresting Duclos, Stie, and other patriots fully exposed their ugly face of siding with the United States and openly antagonizing the French people.

    This series of bloody atrocities is clearly instigated by American imperialism. Its purpose is not only to carry out shameless intimidation against the French people, but also to further create tension in Europe, so as to promote its plan to prepare for a new war. Recently, the United States has been increasingly rampant in creating war threats in Europe. A few days ago, it coerced its Western European vassal states in Bonn and Paris to sign the so-called "General Treaty" for the rearmament of West Germany and the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty. The American warmongers know very well that the people of European countries will inevitably launch more intense struggles to oppose these war-mongering treaties and their aggression plans, so they want to use terroristic suppression to extinguish the flames of anger of the European people, in order to eliminate the difficulties in preparing for war. This is the purpose of its directing the French Pinay government to carry out vicious persecution against the French Communist Party and the patriotic French people.

    This kind of insane brutality by the American and French reactionaries has aroused greater hatred and resistance from the French people against American imperialism and the Pinay government. The French General Confederation of Labor has called on all French workers to hold a general strike to express their protest. The heroic struggle of the French people will receive the unanimous support of peace-loving people all over the world. The French Pinay government must immediately release Duclos and other patriotic people, and stop all brutal acts of terroristic suppression.

    Resolutely Oppose the American "General Treaty" for Rearming West Germany

    The United States, Britain, and France, together with the West German Bonn puppet government, signed the so-called "General Treaty" on the 26th of this month. This "treaty" is essentially a shackle to re-militarize and colonize West Germany. Its signing completely violates the Potsdam Agreement on the post-war handling of the German question. When Adenauer signed this traitorous contract, another treaty prepared by the United States—the so-called "European Defense Community Treaty"—was waiting for him to sign. Therefore, the so-called "General Treaty" is entirely a treaty to divide Germany and prepare for war. It gives the West German people not independence and peace, but enslavement and the threat of war.

    This so-called "General Treaty" was signed at a time when the Soviet Union was continuing its just efforts for the peace and unity of Germany. For several years after the war, the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to the policy of accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and unifying Germany. Especially since March 10 of this year, the Soviet government has further taken active steps, repeatedly sending notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, suggesting that the four countries jointly discuss the peace treaty with Germany and the issue of unifying Germany, and put forward a draft of the principles of the peace treaty with Germany. However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have adopted delaying tactics to the Soviet proposals, and have tried their best to obstruct direct negotiations between the four countries. Just two days before the United States, Britain, and France signed a treaty with the Bonn government, the Soviet government once again sent notes to the three governments, on the one hand exposing their conspiracy to create a separate peace treaty with Germany, and at the same time reiterating its proposal that the four countries immediately begin discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet Union's position is fully in line with the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, and it represents the common aspiration of the German people and all peace-loving people in the world. However, the United States, Britain, and France are determined to implement a war policy that is completely contrary to this, attempting to block the path to resolving the unification of Germany and concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with Germany. This is enough to make the people of the world see more clearly who is working hard to ensure peace in Europe and who is actively creating new threats of war.

    American imperialism attempts to dismember Germany with the so-called "General Treaty," but the German people will unite more closely in the great struggle against this treaty. German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl has already declared: "The struggle against the 'General Treaty' does not end with Adenauer's signing of this treaty." We firmly believe that the just struggle of the German people, with the support of the people of the world, will surely win victory; all attempts by American imperialism to enslave the German people and rearm West Germany to prepare for a new war will inevitably be met with shameful failure.

    国际简评
    法国比内政府的暴行必须停止
    法国比内卖国政府非法拘捕法国共产党中央委员、“人道报”编辑斯梯之后，又于本月二十八日悍然逮捕法国共产党中央书记、法国国民议会议员杜克洛和七百多名爱国者，并下令封闭进步工会，扣留“人道报”等进步报纸，以图镇压法国人民对于李奇微到巴黎指挥北大西洋侵略军的抗议示威运动。比内政府迫害法国人民和他们的领袖的这种暴行是极端狂谬的和不计后果的。
    法国人民遭受着美帝国主义及法国反动派的压迫，过着极端痛苦的生活；他们对美帝国主义的仇恨极深。因此当美国刽子手李奇微到达巴黎的时候，法国人民响应了法国共产党的号召，不顾反动警察的恐怖镇压，展开了广泛的抗议示威运动，来表示他们保卫和平与独立自由的意志。法国人民的这一爱国的英勇行动使得美法反动派大为狼狈，因而竟恼羞成怒，采取血腥的反动措施，对法国人民和他们爱戴的领袖横加迫害。法国反动派逮捕杜克洛、斯梯及其他爱国者的卑劣行为，充分暴露了他们投靠美国公然与法国人民为敌的丑恶面目。
    这一连串的血腥暴行显然是美帝国主义所主使的。它的目的不仅是要向法国人民施行无耻恫吓，而且企图进一步造成欧洲的紧张局面，以便于推行其准备新战争的计划。最近一个时期中，美国在欧洲愈加猖狂地制造战争威胁，前几天分别在波恩和巴黎胁迫其西欧附庸国家签订了重新武装西德的所谓“一般性条约”及所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约。美国战争贩子深知欧洲各国人民必然将展开更激烈的斗争来反对他们这些制造战争的条约和他们的侵略计划，因此就想用恐怖镇压的手段来扑灭欧洲人民的怒火，以图排除其准备战争的困难。这就是它指使法国比内政府向法国共产党和法国爱国人民实行凶恶迫害的目的。
    美法反动派的这种疯狂暴行，已激起法国人民对美帝国主义及比内政府的更大仇恨和反抗。法国总工会已号召全法国工人举行总罢工表示抗议。法国人民的英勇斗争将得到全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持。法国比内政府必须立即释放杜克洛及其他爱国人民，停止一切恐怖镇压的暴行。
    坚决反对美国重新武装西德的“一般性条约”
    美英法三国已与西德波恩傀儡政府在本月二十六日签订了所谓“一般性条约”。这个“条约”实质上就是使西德重新军国主义化和殖民地化的枷锁。它的签订完全破坏了战后处理德国问题的波茨坦协定。而阿登纳在这个卖国契约上签字的时候，另外一个由美国预备好的条约——所谓“欧洲防务集团条约”又在等待他去签字了。因此，所谓“一般性条约”完全是一个分裂德国，准备战争的条约。它给予西德人民的不是独立与和平，而是奴役和战争威胁。
    这个所谓“一般性条约”签订的时候，苏联正继续为德国的和平与统一而进行着正义的努力。战后几年来苏联一贯坚持加速缔结对德和约与统一德国的政策。尤其自今年三月十日以来，苏联政府更进一步采取了积极的步骤，一再照会美英法政府，建议四国共同讨论对德和约和统一德国的问题，并提出了对德和约原则草案。但是美英法三国政府对苏联的建议却采取拖延手段，极力阻挠四国进行直接谈判。就在美英法与波恩政府签约的前两天，苏联政府再次照会三国政府，一方面揭穿他们制造单独对德和约的阴谋，同时重申四国立即开始商讨对德和约问题的建议。苏联的主张是完全符合波茨坦协定的精神的，它代表了德国人民及全世界爱好和平人民的共同愿望。但是美英法三国一意执行与此完全相反的战争政策，企图堵塞解决德国统一及缔结全面对德和约问题的途径。这足以使全世界人民更清楚地看到，究竟谁在努力保障欧洲的和平，谁在积极制造新的战争威胁。
    美帝国主义企图以所谓“一般性条约”肢解德国，但是德国人民将在反对这一条约的伟大斗争中更加紧密地团结起来。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥已经宣告：“反对‘一般性条约’的斗争并不因阿登纳签订了这个条约而终止。”我们坚信：德国人民的正义斗争在全世界人民的支持下，必将获得胜利；美帝国主义奴役德国人民、重新武装西德以准备新战争的一切企图必然要遭到可耻的失败。
