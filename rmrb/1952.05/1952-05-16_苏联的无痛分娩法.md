The Soviet Painless Childbirth Method
Liu Minying, Deputy Dean of the Clinical College of the First Military Medical University

Many years ago, some kind obstetricians, seeing the unbearable pain of childbirth for mothers, began to think about and study the essence of childbirth pain and its prevention.

Regarding this issue, obstetricians have two fundamental views: one believes that childbirth pain is a hereditary physiological phenomenon, and the other believes that childbirth pain is an acquired man-made pathological phenomenon.

The first view was held by all obstetricians in the past. Because they saw that almost every parturient woman experienced childbirth pain, they affirmed that childbirth pain was a human hereditary phenomenon. Because they were dominated by this unscientific, erroneous view, they witnessed the suffering of parturient women without concern. Kind-hearted obstetricians could only stand by the bedside, advising the parturient women in pain to "endure it, it will be better in a while." If some parturient women were in too much pain, they had to use some passive methods, such as injecting or orally administering some anesthetics or analgesics to get through the moment.

In the past, obstetrics experts and physiologists, under the sway of the idea that "childbirth pain is a human hereditary phenomenon," conducted a lot of theoretical research on this issue. It was generally believed that the cause of uterine contractions or labor pains during childbirth was twofold: first, the amount of choline acetate in the mother's blood and placenta increased to a certain level; second, the amount of follicle hormone that "induces labor pains" exceeded the amount of corpus luteum hormone that "sustains pregnancy" at the end of pregnancy. Under the control of these two factors, the uterus undergoes strong contractions, forming labor movements and labor pains. When the uterus contracts, the fetus is compressed and descends. During the process of fetal descent, the cervical sympathetic ganglia are strongly compressed, thus causing labor pain. Furthermore, due to the increased amount of pituitary posterior lobe hormone, the sensitivity of the uterus is enhanced, making the pain even more severe. These theories prove that only pain can promote uterine contractions to cause childbirth. Therefore, childbirth pain is a physiological and beneficial phenomenon. Recently, this theory has developed to its peak, forming the "childbirth pain is necessary" argument. Because some obstetricians believe that childbirth pain should not only not be relieved, but also is a beneficial phenomenon that helps and promotes labor, so when they encounter some parturient women who have no pain or mild pain during childbirth, they still use physical or drug methods to implement "labor pain promotion methods."

Although the above theories are based on laboratory or clinical research, according to experiments conducted by Soviet obstetricians in recent years based on Pavlov's theory, the above theories are one-sided, overly far-fetched, and even some are imagined. Why do we say this? Because painless childbirth according to the new Soviet method can be completely free of labor pains and childbirth pains, and the childbirth process is very smooth, which proves clinically that childbirth pain is not "necessary." Secondly, the blood of parturient women undergoing childbirth according to the new Soviet painless childbirth method does not show choline acetate, which proves that choline acetate has no significance in promoting uterine contractions and pain during normal childbirth (as for why choline acetate appears in the blood of some parturient women who do not undergo childbirth according to the new Soviet painless childbirth method, it is currently being studied). Because childbirth can be painless, it of course also negates the follicle hormone's "induction of labor pains," which makes one doubt the pituitary posterior lobe hormone's role in increasing uterine sensitivity. Secondly, this proves that when the fetus descends from the uterus through the cervix and soft birth canal, although the nerve ganglia or nerve endings of the cervix and birth canal are compressed, it does not reach the pain threshold.

So, how exactly does childbirth labor pain occur?

Soviet obstetricians Vilyvovsky, Polochicher, and Shugom, based on the theory of the great Soviet physiologist Pavlov, believe that childbirth pain is an acquired, man-made pathological phenomenon.

In Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes, there is a principle: "The cerebral cortex, using the function of conditioned reflexes, can prevent pathogenic factors from exerting pathogenic effects; and it can also make non-pathogenic factors exert pathogenic effects." Therefore, the action of uterine contractions pushing out the baby is a very slight stimulus, which originally could not reach the pain threshold; but due to the relationship of conditioned reflexes formed in the brain, it becomes a stimulus that can reach the pain threshold.

What is a conditioned reflex? How does the cerebral cortex use conditioned reflexes to turn a stimulus that was originally painless into a painful stimulus?

Let's first explain what is called a conditioned reflex. For example, the first time we eat a red, sour plum, we don't know what the sour plum tastes like. When we put the sour plum in our mouth and taste it, it is sour, so a large amount of saliva is secreted in the mouth. At this time, the secretion of a large amount of saliva is due to the sour stimulation; from receiving the sour stimulation to the flow of saliva, this is a nerve and reflex process. This reflex process can be called an "unconditional reflex." According to animal experiments, animals with removed brains can also have "unconditional reflexes." Later, for example, when we go to the South and see red, sour plum fruits hanging on the trees, that is to say, we see the "condition" that stimulates saliva secretion, even if we don't put the sour plum in our mouth, a large amount of saliva will be secreted. Many people have experienced this, so the story of "quenching thirst by thinking of plums" has been formed. This reflex phenomenon of not eating sour plums but only seeing the "condition" that stimulates saliva secretion and then drooling is called a "conditioned reflex." According to animal experiments, animals with removed brains cannot form "conditioned reflexes"; in other words, forming "conditioned reflexes" is a function of the brain.

Similar conditioned reflexes as mentioned above are numerous in people's lives, but for people, this is harmless.

Next, let's explain how the brain uses the function of conditioned reflexes to turn harmless things into harmful things.

For example, we give a dog an injection of apomorphine (an emetic drug) once a day. About twenty minutes after the injection, the dog vomits. After several injections, we inject the dog not with apomorphine, but with physiological saline, but the dog still vomits. Physiological saline originally has no emetic effect, but because this dog is injected with an emetic every day, the brain and "injection" have formed a vomiting conditioned reflex connection, so in the dog's life, as long as it encounters the "condition" of "injection," it will vomit. Similar experiments can not only be done on people, but also be formed unconsciously in our personal lives. Forming such conditioned reflexes can cause pain to people, so it can be called a harmful conditioned reflex.

One of the fundamental differences between humans and animals is that humans have speech and writing. Although speech and writing are abstract things, they are a form of reflection of objective objects. Therefore, in addition to using real objects to form conditioned reflexes, humans can also use speech and writing to form conditioned reflexes.

We can give a very common example:

Everyone says that snakes are a very terrible poisonous insect, and many people have gained this impression from novels, comics, and stories since childhood; but few people have personally suffered from snake venom. However, when a snake really appears in front of them, they will be so frightened that their hair stands on end. This kind of terrifying nerve reflex is created by humans through speech, writing, etc. Especially northerners, no one dares to eat snake meat, believing that snake meat is the most poisonous and emetic thing. If you are forced to eat snake meat, or you see others eating snake meat, you will inevitably feel nauseous and vomit. Everyone knows that snake meat originally has no emetic effect, and some southerners like to eat it very much, and they don't feel nauseous after eating it, but northerners vomit when they eat snakes. Obviously, the vomiting reflex phenomenon at this time is not caused by snake meat, but entirely by usual education. The reason why usual education has such a great effect is of course because the brain plays a leading role in it.

When the people in my hometown try to save people who have taken poison, because they don't know how to use gastric lavage and emetics, they often force the patient to eat feces, and if they don't eat, they pour it in, in order to cause the patient to vomit violently and expel the poison. Feces have no emetic effect, and animals and babies have never vomited after eating them. However, adults vomit after eating it because they have been educated that "feces are dirty things."

Therefore, we can be sure that something that is originally harmless can be turned into a pathogenic and harmful thing by using educational methods through the action of the brain.

Childbirth is originally a matter without any pain. For example, during pregnancy, the uterus becomes very large, but it does not feel painful; of course, it should not be painful during uterine contractions. Secondly, we do not feel pain when food or feces pass through our digestive tract, or when urine is excreted from the bladder. The reason is that the impulses of all visceral activities are transmitted to the brain, and they are usually below the perception threshold. However, many years ago, due to insufficient health knowledge and unfavorable conditions, many women had diseases of the reproductive organs or appendages; in addition, since the science of obstetrics did not yet exist, women mostly gave birth on their own. Under these conditions, some women did experience pain during childbirth, and even suffered misfortune. At that time, these women or other bystanders did not know the cause of this childbirth pain, and unilaterally believed that everyone must experience pain during childbirth. After this understanding spread, it formed a "verbal childbirth pain conditioned reflex" throughout humanity. This is the historical process and root cause of childbirth pain.

Secondly, every parturient woman has a kind of fear when giving birth, afraid of pain, afraid of bleeding, and even afraid that something unfortunate will happen to the mother and child. Therefore, the air in the obstetrics ward is very tense. Parturient women with fear concentrate on the labor movements of the reproductive organs, which increases the brain's sensitivity to impulses sent from the reproductive organs, making some slight stimuli reach the pain threshold.

After we understand that the essence of childbirth pain is a pain conditioned reflex formed by education, it is not difficult to think of ways to prevent it, that is, to use educational methods to eliminate it. The Soviet Union calls this method of preventing childbirth pain without using drugs but only using "lessons" "mental prophylactic" painless childbirth. Tens of thousands of women in the Soviet Union have given birth using this method. In view of the rationality and effectiveness of this method, the Soviet Ministry of Health has now ordered all obstetrics hospitals and midwifery stations across the country to implement it.

The educational method is very simple, that is, a doctor, midwife, or nurse with high prestige talks to or gives lessons to the parturient woman. The content of the course is to explain the source of childbirth pain; to explain the rationality of all reproductive organ movements during childbirth; to explain what feelings there are in each stage of childbirth; to explain how to cooperate with the midwife during childbirth; to explain that highly developed modern obstetrics is guaranteed for the safety of the mother and child, etc. It is best to start classes one month before childbirth, a total of five or six times, the first time in the outpatient department, and then in the maternity hospital. Each lesson takes 20 minutes. Parturient women who have been educated have no fear during childbirth and are very quiet, because everything is proceeding according to the predetermined steps they expected. Her consciousness is busy analyzing everything that is going on and applying the methods she has learned before at the right time.

Using educational methods to eliminate "painful conditioned reflexes" is the main method of preventing childbirth pain. In order to ensure that the parturient woman has no pain during childbirth, some auxiliary methods can also be used. One method is to have the parturient woman use a kind of action to prevent the occurrence of pain. Another method is for the midwife to use a kind of technique to prevent the occurrence of pain in the parturient woman.

The first method is to have the parturient woman make rhythmic exhaling movements and tightly grasp the handles of the delivery bed when the cervix opens very wide during childbirth. The purpose of doing this is, on the one hand, to strengthen abdominal pressure and help the baby descend; on the other hand, to use this action to reduce the brain's sensory sensitivity, so that the uterine contractions and the fetus's compression of the birth canal do not become painful.

Probably many people have experienced that clenching the teeth and exhaling can reduce or eliminate pain. Why can clenching the teeth and exhaling reduce the brain's sensory degree? The reason is that the brain has a form of activity called "inhibitory activity," which can also be called "tension." This activity can terminate "excitatory reflexes" to the outside world. Pain is an "excitatory reflex" to the outside world. Therefore, the inhibitory activity of the brain can be aroused by clenching the teeth and exhaling movements to reduce the excitatory pain sensation.

The second method is for the midwife to massage the parturient woman's lower abdominal wall or abdomen and compress the painful points. According to psychological theory, the purpose of doing this is to shift the parturient woman's attention; according to physiology, it is to use the law of external inhibition of conditioned reflexes to put the corresponding cerebral cortex that receives the massage and compression site in a state of excitement, to inhibit the excitatory activity of the cerebral cortex that receives the impulses of the uterus and reproductive organs, so that it is in a state of inhibition, to achieve the purpose of reducing the sensitivity and reaction function of that part.

There are many examples of using this principle of physiology to reduce pain. For example, in wartime, a soldier is shot through a hole by a bullet, but because all his energy is focused on the enemy, he does not feel pain himself. If it were in peacetime, not to mention being shot through a hole, even sticking a thorn would be very painful.

We have briefly explained the essence of childbirth pain and its prevention methods as above.

To promote this new painless childbirth method that seeks happiness for women, according to our preliminary implementation experience, we need to work hard to overcome some obstacles. First of all, we must break the conservative ideas and distrust of this new method among doctors, midwives, and nurses. We must not only give them inspiration and education from a theoretical and clinical practical point of view to lay the foundation for their confidence in promoting it; but also explain the political significance of promoting this work to promote their enthusiasm for promoting this work. Second, we must thoroughly overcome all bad medical and nursing styles. Because this new painless childbirth method is built on the basis of the parturient woman's high trust in the midwife; the parturient woman's trust in the midwife depends on the midwife's care for her and her own skilled techniques. If the midwife cannot meet the parturient woman's hopes in this regard, the new painless childbirth method will be more difficult to succeed. We should not simply regard this new painless childbirth method as just an easy technical problem. When we implement this new painless childbirth method, we should combine it with rectifying the medical and nursing style, and formulate a code of conduct for obstetrics staff, requiring everyone to abide by it. Third, due to the different cultural levels, life experiences, and ideological concerns of the parturient women, we must grasp the characteristics of each person for education, the examples cited should be appropriate and diverse, and try to win over parturient women who have had painless childbirth as teachers. The effect of doing so will be greater.

    苏联的无痛分娩法
    第一军医大学临床学院副院长　刘民英
    好多年代以前，有些善良的产科医生，看到产妇们的分娩疼痛很难忍受，就开始思索和研究分娩疼痛的本质及其预防法。
    对于这一问题，产科医生们，他们有两种根本看法：一种认为分娩疼痛是遗传的生理现象，一种认为分娩疼痛是后天人为的病理现象。
    第一种看法，是以往所有产科医生们的看法。因为他们看到几乎每个产妇都发生分娩疼痛，所以他们就肯定分娩疼痛是人类遗传的现象。因为他们被这种非科学的错误观点统治着，所以他们目睹着产妇们的这种痛苦而不在意。好心的产科医生，只有站在产床旁边劝告叫痛的产妇说：“忍受些吧，过一会就好了。”有的产妇痛得实在厉害，他们只好用些消极的办法，如给产妇注射或口服一些麻醉药或镇痛药，以求得顶过一时。
    以往的产科专家和生理学家们，在“分娩疼痛是人类遗传的现象”的观念支配下，作了很多有关这一问题的理论研究。一般认为：分娩时子宫收缩或阵痛的起因有二：一是产妇血中和胎盘中的醋酸胆胺增加到了一定量；一是在妊娠末期“有诱发阵痛作用”的卵胞荷尔蒙超过了“有妊娠持续作用”的黄体荷尔蒙量。子宫在这两个因素支配下发生强烈收缩，形成分娩动作和阵痛。子宫收缩，胎儿被压迫下降。胎儿下降过程中，强度压迫子宫颈部交感神经节，因而发生产痛。更由于脑下垂体后叶荷尔蒙量增多，以致增强了子宫的感受性，使疼痛程度更形加剧。这些理论，证明只有疼痛才能促使子宫收缩，以惹起分娩。因此，分娩疼痛是合乎生理的有益现象。近来这种理论发展到登峰造极的地步，形成了“分娩疼痛必需说”。因为有些产科医生认为分娩疼痛不但不应解除，而且是有助产和催产作用的有益现象，所以当他们遇到某些产妇在分娩时无痛或痛得轻微时，他们还要用物理的或药物的方法施行“阵痛催进法”。
    以上这些理论虽然是立脚于实验室或临床的研究；但根据以巴甫洛夫学说为基础的苏联产科医生们在近年来的实验，证明以上理论带有片面性，过分地牵强附会，甚至有些是想像的。为什么这样说呢？因为按照苏联新的无痛分娩法进行分娩，可以完全无阵痛及产痛，分娩过程很顺利，这在临床上证明了分娩疼痛并非“必需”。其次，按照苏联新的无痛分娩法进行分娩的产妇，其血中并不出现醋酸胆胺，由此证明醋酸胆胺在正常分娩时，对促进子宫收缩和疼痛没有意义（至于有些不按苏联新无痛分娩法进行分娩的产妇，其血中为何出现醋酸胆胺，现在正在研究）。因为分娩可以不痛，当然也就否定了卵胞荷尔蒙有“诱发阵痛的作用”，这就使人怀疑脑下垂体后叶荷尔蒙有提高子宫感受性的作用。其次，这证明胎儿由子宫经子宫口和软产道下降时，虽然子宫口和产道的神经节或神经末梢受压迫，但也到达不了疼痛阈。
    那么，分娩阵痛到底是怎样发生的呢？
    苏联产科医生维利渥夫斯基、波罗琪柴尔和舒高姆等人，根据苏联大生理学家巴甫洛夫的学说，认为分娩疼痛是后天的人为的病理现象。
    巴甫洛夫的条件反射学说中，有这样一条原则：“大脑皮质运用条件反射的机能，可以使致病因子不发生致病作用；又可以使非致病因子发生致病作用。”因此子宫收缩将婴儿压出的动作是一个很轻微的刺激，本不是能达到疼痛阈的刺激；但由于在大脑中形成了条件反射的关系，就变成了能达到疼痛阈的刺激了。
    条件反射是怎么一回事呢？大脑皮质怎样借条件反射将本来不痛的刺激变成了有痛的刺激呢？
    我们先解释什么叫条件反射。譬如我们第一次吃红红的酸梅，不知道酸梅是什么味道，把酸梅放到嘴里，一尝是酸的，于是，嘴里分泌出大量的唾液。这时分泌出大量的唾液，是酸刺激的关系；由接受酸刺激到流出唾液，这是一个神经和反射的过程。这种反射过程可以叫做“无条件的反射”。根据动物实验，切除了大脑的动物也可发生“无条件反射”。以后，譬如我们到了南方，看到了树上挂着红红的酸梅果，也就是说，看到了刺激分泌唾液的“条件”，这时虽然不把酸梅放在嘴里，也会有大量唾液分泌出来。这个经验，很多人体会过，所以形成了“望梅止渴”的故事。这种不吃酸梅而只看到了刺激分泌唾液的“条件”就流口水的反射现象，就叫做“条件反射”。根据动物实验，切除了大脑的动物是不能形成“条件反射”的；换句话说，形成“条件反射”是大脑的机能。
    类似上边所说的条件反射，在人的生活中是很多的，但对人来说，这是一种无害性的。
    其次我们再解释大脑怎样借条件反射的作用，将无害的东西变成有害的东西？
    譬如我们每天给狗注射一次阿朴吗啡（催吐药）。注射后，过二十来分钟，狗就呕吐起来。注射几次后，我们给狗注射的不是阿朴吗啡，而是生理食盐水，可是狗照样会呕吐。生理食盐水本来没有催吐作用，但由于这只狗每天注射催吐剂，大脑和“注射”形成了呕吐性的条件反射的联系，因此，在狗的生活中，只要遇到“注射”这个“条件”，它就会呕吐起来。类似这样的实验，不但在人身上也可作到，就是在我们个人的生活中，也会不知不觉地形成的。形成类似这样的条件反射，会给人造成痛苦，所以可以称此为有害性的条件反射。
    人和动物的原则区别之一，就是人类有言语和文字。言语和文字虽然是一个抽象的东西，但它是客观实物的反映形式。因此，对人除了用实物可以形成条件反射外，还可用言语和文字形成条件反射。
    我们可以举出一个很普通的例子：
    大家都说蛇是一种很可怕的毒虫，好多人从小就从小说、漫画、故事中得到这种印象；但很少人是亲身受过蛇的毒害的。然而当蛇真的出现在面前时，他们就会吓得头发直竖。像这种使人恐怖的神经反射，是由人类借言语、文字等造成的。特别是北方人，谁也不敢吃蛇肉，认为蛇肉是最毒最能使人发呕的一种东西。假若逼着你吃蛇肉，或你看到别人吃蛇肉，那必然是要恶心呕吐的。大家知道，蛇肉本来是没有催吐作用的，有些南方人很喜欢吃它，吃下去并不发呕，可是北方人吃蛇，就发呕。很明显的，这时的呕吐反射现象，并不是由蛇肉造成的，而完全是由平时的教育造成的。平时的教育之所以有这样大的作用，当然是因为大脑在其中起着主导作用。
    我们家乡的老百姓，当挽救服毒的人时，由于他们不知道用洗胃法和催吐药，往往强迫病人吃粪便，不吃就灌，以便引起病人强烈的呕吐，将毒物吐出。粪便是没有催吐作用的，动物和婴儿吃了下去，没有发生过呕吐现象。可是成年人由于受过“粪便是肮脏东西”的教育，所以吃下去就发呕。
    因此，我们可以确信：本来是无害的东西，用教育的方法，通过大脑的作用，就可以变成致病的有害的东西。
    分娩这件事情，本来是没有丝毫疼痛的，譬如在妊娠期中，子宫变得很大，但不觉得疼痛；当然在子宫收缩时也就不应该疼痛。其次，食物或粪便通过我们的消化管，或尿由膀胱排出，我们感觉不出有疼痛。原因是所有内脏活动的冲动，传达到大脑，平时都是在感觉阈以下的。但在很多年以前，由于卫生知识的不够和条件的不允许，很多妇女有生殖器或附属器的疾病；加之产科这门科学还没有，妇女们多是自产。在这样条件下，有一部分妇女在分娩中确实是发生了疼痛，甚至遭到了不幸。那时，这一部分妇女或旁观的其他人，不知道这种分娩疼痛的原因，片面地认为每人分娩一定要疼痛。这样的认识传布开以后，就在全人类中形成了“言语性的分娩疼痛条件反射”。这是分娩疼痛产生的历史经过及根源。
    其次，每个产妇当分娩时，都有一种恐惧心理，怕疼痛，怕出血，甚至怕母子遭到什么不幸。因此产科病房的空气是十分紧张的。有恐惧心理的产妇聚精会神地注意着生殖器的分娩动作，这样就提高了大脑对生殖器官发来冲动的敏感性，使得一些轻微刺激到达了疼痛阈。
    我们明白了分娩疼痛的本质是一种由教育形成的疼痛条件反射后，就不难想出预防的方法，那就是再用教育的方法解除它。苏联把这种不用药品而只用“上课”来预防分娩疼痛的方法，叫做“精神预防性”无痛分娩法。苏联用这种方法分娩的妇女，已达数万人。苏联保健部鉴于这种方法的合理及有效，现在已明令全国各产科医院和接产站实行。
    教育的方法很简单，即由享有高度威信的医生、助产士或护士给产妇谈话或上课。课程的内容是说明分娩疼痛的来源；说明分娩过程中一切生殖器动作的合理性；说明分娩的各期中有何感觉；说明分娩时怎样和助产者合作；说明高度发展的现代产科对母子安全一定有保障等等。上课最好从产前一个月开始，一共上五、六次，第一次在门诊部，以后即在产院。每次上课用二十分钟即可。受过教育的产妇，在分娩时都没有害怕心理，非常安静，因为
    一切都按照预定的、她所期待的步骤在那里进行着。她的意识在忙着分析进行着的一切，并适时地应用她以前学习过的方法。
    用教育的方法消除“疼痛性的条件反射”，是预防分娩疼痛的主要方法。为了保证产妇在分娩时没有丝毫的疼痛，还可以用些补助办法。一个办法是：让产妇自己运用一种动作，以预防疼痛的发生。另一个办法是：助产者运用一种手法，以预防产妇疼痛的发生。
    第一个办法，就是在分娩过程中，子宫口开张到很大时，使产妇作节奏性的迸气动作，紧紧地用力抓住产床拉手。这样作的目的，一方面是加强腹压，帮助婴儿下降；一方面是借这种动作，降低大脑的感觉敏锐性，使子宫的收缩和胎儿的压迫产道不致变成疼痛性。
    大概很多人都体验过：咬紧牙关和迸气是可以减轻或消除疼痛的。咬紧牙关和迸气，为何能减低大脑的感觉度呢？原因是大脑有一种活动形式叫做“制止性活动”也可以叫做“张力”，这种活动能终止对外界的“兴奋性反射”。疼痛就是一种对外界的“兴奋性反射”。所以可以通过咬紧牙关和迸气的动作唤起大脑的制止性活动，以减低兴奋性的疼痛感觉。
    第二个办法是助产者按摩产妇下腹壁或腹部和压迫痛点。这样作的目的，按心理学说，是转移产妇的注意力；按照生理学来说，是利用条件反射外制止的法则，使接受按摩和压迫部位的相应的大脑皮质，处于兴奋状态，以制止住接受子宫和生殖器冲动的大脑皮质部的兴奋活动，使之处于制止状态，以达到减低该部的敏感性和反应机能。
    运用生理学这一条原则来减轻疼痛的例子是很多的。譬如作战时，战士被枪弹打穿了一个洞，但由于全部精力注意着敌人，所以自己不感觉疼痛。假若在平时，不要说穿一个洞，就是扎一根刺也是很疼的。
    关于分娩疼痛的本质及其预防法，我们简略地作如上解释。
    推行这种为妇女谋幸福的新的无痛分娩法，根据我们初步实行的经验来看，需要努力克服一些阻碍。首先要打破医生、助产士和护士的保守观念和对此新方法的不信任，我们不但要从理论上和临床实际上给予启发和教育，以奠定其推行的信心；更要说明推行这一工作的政治意义，以促进他们对推行这一工作的热情。第二，必须彻底克服一切不良的医疗和护理作风。因为这个新的无痛分娩法是建筑在产妇对助产者有高度信赖的基础上；产妇对助产者的信赖决定于助产者对她的爱护和自己的熟练技术。假若助产者在这方面不能满足产妇的希望，新无痛分娩法是比较难于成功的。我们不要将此新无痛分娩法简单地看成只是一个轻而易举的技术问题。我们在实行这种新无痛分娩法时，应该结合着整顿医疗和护理作风，订出产科工作人员的守则，要求人人遵行。第三，由于产妇们的文化程度、生活经历和思想顾虑不同，我们要抓住每个人的特点进行教育，举的例子要恰当而且多样性，尽量争取无痛分娩过的产妇当教员。这样作的效果是会更大的。
