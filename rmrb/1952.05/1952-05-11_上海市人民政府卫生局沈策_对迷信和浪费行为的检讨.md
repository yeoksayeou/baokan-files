    Shen Ce of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Health Bureau
    Self-Criticism Regarding Superstition and Wasteful Behavior

    To the Editors: The criticism made by comrades Zhou Qin, Song Zhiqian, and Zhang Dingwen in the People's Daily on April 3rd regarding my superstitious and wasteful behavior when returning home to sweep the tombs is completely correct. The situations mentioned in the original letter of criticism are all factual. My superstitious and wasteful behavior created a negative influence among the masses and damaged the prestige of the Party and the People's Government, which is very wrong. I am a revolutionary cadre, and while the local area is opposing superstition, I went to promote superstition; the government calls for thrift, but I was wasteful. This is truly very wrong. I accept the readers' criticism of me, and I guarantee not to repeat similar mistakes.

    上海市人民政府卫生局沈策
    对迷信和浪费行为的检讨
    编辑同志：四月三日人民日报所载周芹、宋执权、张鼎文三同志对我回家扫墓时的迷信和浪费行为的批评，是完全正确的。原批评信中提到的情况，都是事实。我的那种迷信和浪费的行为，在群众中造成不好的影响，使党和人民政府的威信受到损失，这是很不对的。我是一个革命干部，地方上在反迷信，我却去提倡迷信；政府号召节约，我却在浪费。这实在是十分错误的。我接受读者对我的批评，我保证不再重犯类似错误。沈策
