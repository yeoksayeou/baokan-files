Northeast China Electric Power Workers Launch Labor Competition

    Since the "May Day" International Labor Day, electric power workers in Northeast China have launched a region-wide labor competition for safe power generation and supply between plants (bureaus). Over 95% of the total number of electric power workers in Northeast China are participating in the competition. In this competition, each plant (bureau) will resolutely eliminate all responsibility accidents in power generation and supply to ensure the supply of inexpensive electricity.

    This competition is launched on the basis of the first and second phases of the plant (bureau) labor competition carried out by the electric power workers in Northeast China during the increase production and practice economy campaign last year, and the great victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. In the first and second phases of the competition, each unit organized and mobilized all employees to earnestly implement various rules and regulations, learn advanced experience, and carry out labor competitions within each unit, thus achieving great success in eliminating accidents. 93.7% of the power bureaus reduced accidents, and 33% of the power plants completely eliminated accidents. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the obstacles to carrying out production competitions were removed, and the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the workers were unprecedentedly improved, and the power generation and supply situation became more normal. This is a solid foundation for eliminating all responsibility accidents in power generation and supply.

    During the competition period, the participating units will concentrate on doing the following tasks well: First, it is necessary to deeply conduct the education of "safety first" among all employees, so that employees can strive to complete the elimination of accidents as a political task. Because accidents not only make it impossible to complete the production tasks of the unit, but also seriously affect the production of other industrial and mining enterprises. Each unit will use the existing experience in eliminating accidents to educate and persuade employees, and correct the erroneous idea that "accidents cannot be eliminated."

    Secondly, vigorously promote advanced experience. Do a good job in equipment maintenance and accident prevention. According to the responsibility accidents that have occurred in the Northeast Electric Power System in the past, about 52% were due to poor maintenance, and about 48% were caused by operational errors and other reasons. Therefore, it is necessary to universally promote the advanced Soviet quick maintenance method to strengthen maintenance work and improve maintenance quality. Quick maintenance is carried out under the most scientific organization and planning. It not only shortens the maintenance time and advances power generation, but also greatly improves the maintenance quality and ensures the safe operation of the machine. On the other hand, each unit will also strengthen the systems of patrol inspection, shift handover, and operation supervision to further implement various technical operating procedures and prevent the occurrence of accidents.

    The participating units will mobilize all employees to seriously discuss and formulate a plan for increasing production and practicing economy centered on ensuring safe power generation and supply, organize labor competitions within each bureau and plant, and do their best to ensure uninterrupted power supply in response to Comrade Gao Gang's call.

### 东北区电业职工开展劳动竞赛

    东北区电业职工开展劳动竞赛
    东北区电业职工从“五一”国际劳动节起，展开了全区性的安全发电、供电厂（局）际劳动竞赛。参加竞赛的职工占东北区电业职工总人数的百分之九十五以上。在这次竞赛中，各厂（局）将坚决消灭一切发电、供电的责任事故，保证供应廉价电力。
    这次竞赛是在去年东北区电业职工在增产节约运动中所展开的第一二期厂（局）际劳动竞赛，和“三反”运动伟大胜利的基础上开展起来的。在第一二期竞赛中，各单位都组织和动员了全体职工，认真贯彻执行各种规程制度，学习先进经验，开展了各单位内部的劳动竞赛，因而在消灭事故方面取得了很大的成就，百分之九十三·七的电业局减少了事故，百分之三十三的发电厂完全消灭了事故。经过“三反”“五反”运动，清除了开展生产竞赛的障碍，职工群众的阶级觉悟和生产积极性空前地提高了，发电、供电情况更加正常，这是消灭一切发电、供电责任事故的巩固基础。
    参加竞赛的各单位在竞赛期间，将集中力量做好以下几项工作：首先，要在全体职工中深入进行“安全第一”的教育，使职工们把消灭事故作为政治任务去努力完成。因为，出了事故不但使本单位的生产任务无法完成，并将严重地影响其他工矿企业的生产。各单位将用现有的消灭事故的经验教育和说服职工，纠正“事故不能消灭”的错误思想。
    其次，大力推广先进经验。作好设备检修和事故预防工作。根据东北电业系统过去所发生的责任事故来看，其中百分之五十二左右属于检修不良，百分之四十八左右是由于操作错误及其他原因造成的。因此，必须普遍推广苏联先进的快速检修法，以加强检修工作，提高检修质量。快速检修是在最科学的组织、计划下进行检修，它不但缩短了检修时间，提前发电，并且大大提高了检修质量，保证了机器的安全运行。另一方面，各单位还将加强巡回检查、交接班和操作监护等制度，以进一步贯彻各种技术操作规程，防止事故的发生。
    参加竞赛的各单位，将发动全体职工认真讨论，订出以保证安全发电、供电为中心的增产节约计划，组织各局、厂内部的劳动竞赛，全力保证不停电，以响应高岗同志的号召。
