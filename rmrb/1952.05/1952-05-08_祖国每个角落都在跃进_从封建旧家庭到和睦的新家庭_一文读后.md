    The Motherland is Leaping Forward in Every Corner
    —After Reading “From Feudal Old Family to Harmonious New Family”
    I felt very excited after reading the article "From Feudal Old Family to Harmonious New Family" published on the third page of the People's Daily on April 27th. Every sentence in this newsletter is full of delightful new atmospheres. It symbolizes that every corner of the motherland is leaping forward. The family of Aiyi Xihan, a Hui woman in Xinjiang Province, was originally a dark and autocratic family. The hearts of all family members were separated and in pain. However, after the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement was launched, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, when the rural areas of Xinjiang Province changed, Aiyi Xihan's family also became a democratic, harmonious, and happy new family. They actively participated in the rural social reform movement. The local people said: "The Communist Party is so good that even the family affairs of the common people are handled so well." Such vivid facts are so touching!
    I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, all dark and painful families will become happy new families like Aiyi Xihan's. We hope that journalists will report more new families and new atmospheres for us.    Sun Heng

    祖国每个角落都在跃进
    ——“从封建旧家庭到和睦的新家庭”一文读后
    我读了四月二十七日人民日报第三版上刊载的“从封建旧家庭到和睦的新家庭”一文后，感到很兴奋。这篇通讯的每一句话，都充满着令人喜悦的新气象。它象征着祖国的每个角落，都在跃进着。新疆省回族妇女阿衣洗汗的家庭，本是一个黑暗专制的家庭。全家人的心都是分离的、苦痛的。可是，当减租反霸运动开展以后，在共产党、毛主席的正确领导下，新疆省的农村变了样的时候，阿衣洗汗的家庭也变成了民主和睦的快乐的新家庭。他们积极地参加着农村的社会改革运动。当地群众说：“共产党真好，连老百姓的家务事，也给办得好好的。”这样活生生的事实，多感动人啊！
    我深深地相信，在共产党、毛主席的领导下，一切阴暗苦痛的家庭，都将变成像阿衣洗汗的这样幸福的新家庭。我们希望新闻工作者为我们报道更多的新家庭、新气象。    孙衡
