Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: The Burma Peace Committee will convene the All-Burma Peace Congress in Rangoon from May 10th to 13th. The China Peace Committee sent a telegram of congratulations on May 8th. The telegram reads as follows:
    To the Burma Peace Committee, Rangoon:
    We are honored to have received your invitation and have decided to send Mr. Hu Yuzhi, a member of the Executive Committee of our Committee, to Burma to attend the All-Burma Peace Congress to be held in Rangoon from May 10th to 13th this year. However, due to the British government's unreasonable refusal to issue Mr. Hu Yuzhi a transit visa, the China Peace Committee is unable to have a representative participate in the grand gathering of the Burmese people to defend peace, which we deeply regret.

    The Burmese people, who suffered as much as the Chinese people in the Japanese imperialist war of aggression, love peace and hate war. Today, the U.S. government is rearming Japan as a tool for expanding aggression, and is already conducting large-scale germ warfare within China and Korea, threatening peace in Asia and the world. At present, the development of the Burmese people's movement to defend peace not only contributes to peace in Asia, but also to peace in the world. Please allow us to extend our warm congratulations to the All-Burma Peace Congress and express the concern and support of the Chinese people to you. We are willing to work closely with the peace-loving people of Burma to fight together against wars of aggression, against germ warfare, and to defend peace in Asia and the world. We wish the congress success.
    China Peace Committee
    May 8th

Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: The China Peace Committee issued a statement on May 8th, strongly protesting the British government's unreasonable refusal to issue transit visas to our representatives attending the All-Burma Peace Congress, and its despicable act of undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people. The full text of the protest is as follows:

    The Burma Peace Committee will convene the All-Burma Peace Congress in Rangoon from May 10th to 13th and formally invited the China Peace Committee in April to send representatives to participate. We have decided to accept the invitation and send Mr. Hu Yuzhi, a member of the Executive Committee of our Committee, to Rangoon to participate. The Burmese government has already issued entry visas to the Chinese representatives and their entourage, but the British government has unreasonably refused to issue transit visas. This tyrannical measure by the British government has aroused anger and opposition among the Chinese people, making it even clearer to the Chinese people that the British government intends to undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people and, out of fear of the growth of peaceful forces, vainly attempts to obstruct the development of the Asian peace movement. The China Peace Committee protests against this obstruction and sabotage by the British government and firmly believes that the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people and the peace movement in Asian countries will by no means be obstructed or sabotaged by such despicable means of the British government. The Chinese and Burmese people will unite more closely and fight for the defense of peace in Asia and the world.
    China Peace Committee
    May 8th

    全缅和平大会即将在仰光举行
    我保卫世界和平委员会致电祝贺
    并对英政府拒发我赴缅代表过境签证提出抗议
    【新华社八日讯】缅甸保卫世界和平委员会订于五月十日至十三日召开全缅和平大会，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会特于八日去电祝贺。电文如下：仰光缅甸保卫世界和平委员会：
    我们很荣幸地接到贵会的邀请，并已决定由本会执行委员胡愈之先生代表本会，赴缅甸参加本年五月十日至十三日在仰光召开的全缅和平大会。但由于英国政府无理拒绝发给胡愈之先生的过境签证，致使中国人民保卫世界和平委员会，不能有代表参加缅甸人民保卫和平的盛会，我们感到非常遗憾。
    曾在日本帝国主义侵略战争中，和中国人民一样受到灾难的缅甸人民是热爱和平，痛恶战争的。今天美国政府重新武装日本作为扩大侵略的工具，而且在中朝境内已经进行着大规模的细菌战，亚洲和平与世界和平受着严重的威胁。在目前缅甸人民保卫和平运动的开展，不但有助于亚洲和平，并且有助于世界和平。请允许我们向全缅和平大会致以热烈的祝贺，把中国人民的关切和支持向你们表达。我们愿意与缅甸爱好和平的人民，紧密携手，为反对侵略战争，反对细菌战，保卫亚洲与世界和平而共同奋斗。敬祝大会成功。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会

    【新华社八日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会八日发表声明，严重抗议英国政府无理拒发我出席全缅和平大会代表过境签证、破坏中缅两国人民友谊的卑劣行为。抗议全文如下：
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会订于五月十日至十三日在仰光召开全缅和平大会，于四月间正式邀请中国人民保卫世界和平委员会派遣代表参加。我们已决定应邀，由本会执行委员胡愈之先生代表本会赴仰光参加，缅甸政府业已发给中国代表及随员的入境签证，不料英国政府竟无理地拒绝发给过境签证。英国政府这种蛮横的措施已引起中国人民的激愤和反对，使中国人民更加明显地看清：英国政府有意破坏中缅两国人民的友谊，并由于对和平力量增长的恐惧，妄想阻挠亚洲和平运动的发展。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会对英国政府这种阻挠和破坏提出抗议，并深信：中缅两国人民间的友谊和亚洲各国的和平运动断非英国政府这种卑劣手段所能阻挠和破坏，中缅人民将更加团结起来，为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
