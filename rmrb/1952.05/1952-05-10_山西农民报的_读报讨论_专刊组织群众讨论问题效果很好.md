    Shanxi Peasant Newspaper's "Reading Newspaper Discussion" Special Issue Achieves Good Results in Organizing the Masses to Discuss Problems

    Comrade Editor: The Shanxi Peasant Newspaper began publishing the "Reading Newspaper Discussion" special issue in September of last year. The editorial department, in conjunction with the current central work, uses this special issue to proactively raise issues, organize, and lead reading groups in thematic discussions. In addition to selecting and publishing manuscripts from various reading groups participating in the discussion, the publication also uses "Short Commentaries" and other comment forms to provide timely guidance based on ideological issues that may arise or have already arisen among the masses. This method of using the newspaper to organize reading groups to conduct discussions under leadership has yielded great results.

    After the launch of the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries last year, the editorial department discovered from submissions that some cadres and the masses had complacency. Therefore, it selected and published a manuscript from the Dongzhaipo Village reading group in Wuzhai County on how to overcome complacency, and also published a short commentary entitled "The Struggle Between Revolution and Counter-Revolution is a 'Life-and-Death' Long-Term Struggle," calling on reading groups to discuss this issue. This discussion lasted for four months. To guide this discussion, the special issue published a total of nineteen issues. Finally, the editorial department published a concluding editorial, which basically clarified the masses' confusion in the movement and overcame their complacency.

    Currently, the newspaper is closely linked to spring plowing work, and has raised discussion topics such as "How is your reading group promoting drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing work?" and "How is your reading group organizing and improving production technology?" The newspaper has received many letters from farmers' reading groups. Letters with relatively good and representative content are published in prominent positions. For example, the letter from the Gajiagou reading group in the first district of Jiang County stated: "We learned from the newspaper about the experiences of various places in preventing and combating drought, and decided to repair the reservoir that had been broken for many years. Last year, the wheat planted in our village suffered from chlorosis, and cotton was widely affected by aphids. This spring, the masses' lives are difficult, so the reading group organized everyone to discuss 'How to carry out production for self-salvation?' At first, some people had the idea of simply relying on government relief, but after discussion, everyone agreed that this idea was wrong. Now the masses have launched a disaster relief movement to engage in sideline occupations." The Dongwadai Village reading group and the Nanzhang Village reading group in the fifth district of Wenxi County have both overcome the "relying on heaven for food" mentality of some of the masses through reading newspaper discussions, and guided the masses to invest in the spring plowing production movement. Therefore, I suggest that newspapers in various places universally adopt this method of organizing reading groups to conduct discussions under leadership in order to expand the practical effects of reading newspapers.

    山西农民报的“读报讨论”专刊组织群众讨论问题效果很好
    编辑同志：山西农民报从去年九月开始出版“读报讨论”专刊。编辑部结合当前的中心工作，运用这个专刊主动提出问题，组织和领导读报组进行专题讨论。该刊除选发各地读报组参加讨论的稿件外，并根据群众中可能产生或已经产生的思想问题，用“小言论”等述评形式，及时加以指导。这种运用报纸有领导地组织读报组进行讨论的办法，收到了很大的效果。
    去年镇压反革命运动开展以后，编辑部从来稿中发现部分干部和群众存在着麻痹思想。于是选登了五寨县东寨坡村读报组如何讨论克服麻痹思想的稿件，同时发表了“革命与反革命的斗争是‘你死我活’的长期斗争”的小言论，号召读报组讨论这个问题。这次讨论进行了四个月。为了指导这个讨论，专刊共出刊十九期。最后，编辑部发表了一篇总结性的社论，基本上澄清了群众在运动中的混乱思想，克服了群众的麻痹思想。
    目前，该报紧紧结合着春耕工作，提出了“你们读报组是怎样推动防旱抗旱及春耕工作”，及“你们读报组是怎样进行组织起来和提高生产技术”等讨论题。报社收到很多农民读报组的来信。内容比较好而又有代表意义的信，都在显著的地位发表。比如：绛县一区盖家沟读报组的来信说：“我们从报纸上学习了各地防旱抗旱的经验，就决定要修好已经坏了多年的蓄水池。本村去年种的小麦生了黄疸病，棉花又普遍受了蚜虫害，今春群众生活困难，读报组就组织大家座谈‘怎样进行生产自救？’开始有些人存在着单纯依靠政府救济的想法，经过讨论，大家一致认为这种想法是不对头的。现在群众已掀起了搞副业的救灾运动”。闻喜五区东畖底村读报组及南张村读报组，都通过读报讨论的办法，克服了某些群众“靠天吃饭”的思想，引导群众投入了春耕生产运动。因此，我建议各地报纸普遍采用这种有领导地组织读报组进行讨论的办法，以扩大读报的实际效果。    石坚
