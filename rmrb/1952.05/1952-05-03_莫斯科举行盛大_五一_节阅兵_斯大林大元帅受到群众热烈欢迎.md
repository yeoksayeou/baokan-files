Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 1st: A "May Day" parade was held in Moscow's Red Square, with the participation of infantry, artillery, motorized units, the air force, cavalry, and military school cadets.

　　The atmosphere in Red Square was solemn and magnificent. Portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the founders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, were hung high on the buildings opposite Lenin's Mausoleum. Countless bright red banners were inscribed with the "May Day" slogans issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks).

　　Many distinguished guests stood on the granite reviewing stand in front of the Kremlin wall: workers, collective farmers, scientists, cultural workers, state officials, and representatives of the Soviet army. Among the observers were also many foreign guests, including representatives from many countries who came to Moscow at the invitation of Soviet social organizations, members of foreign diplomatic missions in the Soviet Union, and military attachés.

　　When Stalin and the leaders of the Party and government stepped onto the reviewing stand, they were greeted with prolonged applause.

　　The parade was commanded by General Artemyev, and reviewed by Marshal of the Soviet Union Govorov. After Marshal Govorov rode past the troops, he stepped onto the reviewing stand and delivered a speech. After Marshal Govorov finished his speech, the band played the Soviet national anthem, and the festive salute was fired. Sixty young drummers marched into Red Square. The military parade was led by military school cadets. As the last rows of their ranks were leaving Red Square, bombers and fighter jets flew over the spire of the Historical Museum. Guests on the reviewing stand simultaneously saw both the ground and air forces of the Soviet Union.

　　Columns of officers from various branches of the ground forces marched past with neat and firm steps. Following them into Red Square were naval soldiers, students from the Red Banner Infantry School, border guards, and young students from the Suvorov and Nakhimov schools. Cavalry, motorized units, artillery, and tank units also participated in the parade. The military parade concluded with a large band of thousands marching past.

　　The guests on the reviewing stand warmly congratulated the Soviet army, which demonstrated outstanding combat training. After the review, the festive parade began, with the participation of hundreds of thousands of people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: According to TASS, Moscow: Marshal of the Soviet Union Govorov, in his speech at the military parade in Red Square, Moscow, on the 1st, stated: The selfless labor of the Soviet people in the past year has brought new and great victories to the development of industry, agriculture, science, and culture. The material well-being and culture of our people are constantly growing on the basis of the rapid development of the socialist economy. The Soviet government, the Communist Party, and the great Stalin himself are tirelessly concerned with satisfying the growing material and cultural needs of Soviet society. The recent price reduction is a new and clear indication of this concern.

　　The policies of developing the economy and culture pursued by the Soviet government and the governments of the people's democratic countries represent the fundamental interests of the masses of the people and ensure a steady improvement in the living standards of the masses. The situation in capitalist countries is quite the opposite. The policies pursued by the imperialists condemn the working people of bourgeois countries to poverty and suffering. Unemployment, poverty, and starvation are the fate of millions of ordinary people in the capitalist world. The American and British aggressors and their accomplices, disregarding the will of the people, continue to expand their armaments. They have been waging a war of aggression against the heroic Korean people for nearly two years. The American bandits have recently further trampled on various international agreements and used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, thus committing the most serious crimes against humanity. The imperialist policies of the American and British aggressor groups do not have and cannot have the support of the people, because the people do not want war. In all countries, the powerful peace movement is growing stronger day by day. In the struggle to strive for peace and strengthen cooperation among the peoples of all countries, the Soviet Union unswervingly implements a policy of peace and international cooperation, strictly fulfills the international obligations we have undertaken, and scrupulously abides by the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. This peaceful foreign policy is in line with the vital interests of the working people all over the world. Our glorious armed forces, completely loyal to our people, the Communist Party, and the Soviet government, are guarding the peace and the national interests of the Soviet Union. They are ready at any time to respond with a crushing blow to any attempt by the imperialist aggressors to disrupt the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people.

    莫斯科举行盛大“五一”节阅兵
    斯大林大元帅受到群众热烈欢迎
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：五月一日，莫斯科红场上举行了“五一”节检阅，参加的有步兵、炮兵、摩托化部队、空军、骑兵和军事学校的学员。
    红场的气象庄严宏伟。布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家的缔造者列宁和斯大林的画像，高高地挂在列宁陵墓对面的建筑物上。许许多多鲜红的长旗上写着苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会发布的“五一”节口号。
    克里姆林宫墙前的花岗石观礼台上站着很多贵宾：工人、集体农民、科学家、文化工作者、国家机关工作人员和苏联军队的代表。观礼的还有许多外宾，包括了应苏联社会团体的邀请来到莫斯科的许多国家的代表们，各国驻苏外交使团人员和武官们。
    当斯大林以及党和政府的领袖走上检阅台时，受到经久不息掌声的欢迎。
    阅兵式由阿尔杰米也夫上将指挥，苏联元帅戈沃罗夫进行检阅。戈沃罗夫元帅骑马走过军队以后，即步上检阅台，发表演说。戈沃罗夫元帅演说完毕以后，乐队奏苏联国歌，节日的礼炮也响了。六十名青年鼓手走进了红场。军事检阅的行列由军事学校的学员领头，在他们队伍最后的几列将离开红场时，轰炸机和战斗机在历史博物馆的尖顶上排空而过。观礼台上的来宾们同时看到了苏联地上和空中的两支队伍。
    地面部队各兵种的军官行列踏着整齐坚定的步伐走过。随着他们之后走入红场的是海军士兵、红旗步兵学校的学生、边防军以及苏沃罗夫学校和纳希莫夫学校的青年学生。骑兵、摩托化部队、炮兵和坦克部队也参加了检阅。军事检阅末了是数千人的大乐队走过。
    观礼台上的来宾们向表现了卓越的战斗训练的苏联军队热烈祝贺。检阅后，就开始节日大游行，参加游行的有数十万人。
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联元帅戈沃罗夫一日在莫斯科红场阅兵时发表演说称：苏联人民的忘我劳动在过去一年中给工业与农业以及科学和文化的发展带来了新的伟大胜利。我国人民的物质幸福和文化在社会主义经济突飞猛进的基础上不断增长着。苏联政府、共产党和伟大的斯大林本人都在不倦地为满足苏联社会的日益增长的物质需要和文化需要而操心。最近一次减低物价就是这种关心的新的明显的表示。
    苏联政府和各人民民主国家的政府所奉行的发展经济与文化的政策，代表着人民大众的根本利益，保证稳步提高人民大众的生活水准。而资本主义各国的情况却恰恰相反。帝国主义分子所执行的政策使资产阶级国家的劳苦大众注定要遭受贫穷与苦难。失业、贫困与挨饿，就是资本主义世界千百万老百姓的命运。美、英侵略者和他们的帮凶，不顾人民的意志，继续扩张军备。他们对英雄的朝鲜人民进行掠夺战争快满两年了。美国的强盗们最近更蹂躏各种国际协定，在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，从而对人类犯下了最严重的罪行。美英侵略集团的帝国主义政策，是得不到人民支持的，而且也不可能得到人民的支持，因为人民不要战争。在所有的国家里，强大的和平运动正在一天天增长壮大。在争取和平与加强各国人民合作的斗争中，苏联坚持不渝地执行和平与国际合作的政策，一丝不苟地履行我们所承担的国际义务，并且毫不偏颇地遵守平等与不干涉他国内政的原则。这种和平外交政策是符合全世界劳动人民的切身利益的。完全忠于我们人民、共产党和苏维埃政府的我们光荣的武装部队，正在警卫着和平与苏联的国家利益。他们随时准备以粉碎性的打击回答帝国主义侵略者破坏苏联人民的和平创造劳动的任何企图。
