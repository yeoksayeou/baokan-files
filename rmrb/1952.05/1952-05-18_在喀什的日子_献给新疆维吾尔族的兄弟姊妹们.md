Days in Kashgar
—Dedicated to the Uyghur Brothers and Sisters of Xinjiang
Qu Jingji, Head of the Northwest Sub-Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Homecoming Delegation

During my stay in Kashgar, I was constantly moved by the fiery emotions of the people. I deeply felt that from the Korean front lines all the way to the remote west of the motherland—the Pamir Plateau—people separated by thousands of mountains and rivers are closely linked in their hearts.

As my plane crossed the towering Tianshan Mountains and the boundless Gobi Desert, my heart began to stir with unusual excitement.

Kashgar had arrived. Here, the people were seething with enthusiasm. A welcoming crowd of 100,000 people filled the streets and roadsides. They had been waiting for us for three days. Many farmers had come from townships sixty miles away to join the welcoming ranks.

Red flags were waving, fists were dancing, people were jumping, singing, dancing, shaking hands, and offering flowers. In an instant, we were embraced by the crowd, passing through the red flags, greeted by the flowers. People released thousands of peace doves, soaring above the enthusiastic sea of people. The elderly, the young, women and children, cadres and soldiers, workers and farmers, students and imams, all expressed their love for the Volunteer Army with the same profound emotion. Although we did not speak the same language, we were able to convey our sincere feelings to each other with our hands and eyes.

In just a few days, I deeply felt that the hearts of everyone here are yearning for Korea. Every single person here is a staunch warrior in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. Aliman is a middle-aged woman. While listening to my report, she suddenly approached, grabbed my hand, threw herself into my arms, and excitedly asked me to take her to Korea to avenge the Korean people. That day, many elderly women also surrounded me, pulled at me, and hugged me, expressing the same determination to go to Korea. Some spoke while bursting into tears. This passionate and indignant emotion inspired my will as a soldier defending the motherland and safeguarding peace, bringing tears to my eyes.

The people's hearts were burning like fire. Every time we gave a report, groups of people would request to go to Korea to join the Volunteer Army. In Hao Han District, among the 50,000 farmers who listened to the report, 10,500 people requested to go to Korea. Four young people from Yapuquan traveled sixty miles to insist that we take them to Korea. Most touching of all was the seventy-year-old woman, Asihan. She walked twenty miles to request permission for her entire family of four to join the Volunteer Army. She said, "Although I am old, I still want to go to Korea and fight the American devils. Even if I sacrifice myself, I will feel honored." After I comforted and explained to her, she still pleaded, "If I can't go, then my son must go no matter what!" She awaited my reply. I once again explained to her that striving to increase production in her hometown was also an important work in resisting America and aiding Korea, and I hoped she would support the Volunteer Army with her production achievements. She shed tears and replied excitedly, "I will definitely actively produce to support the front lines."

I have contacted and spoken with many Uyghur elders, brothers, and sisters. Here, "Resisting America and Aiding Korea" has become a household phrase. Everyone knows that "only the final victory in resisting America and aiding Korea can guarantee a good and happy life after liberation." They have donated their beloved cattle, sheep, horses, camels, and many precious items to purchase airplanes and cannons. They are making efforts to increase production in all aspects and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Sixty-year-old farmer Wu Shouyemu said to me, "In the past, I was a person who couldn't speak because there was no place for us to speak. After liberation, I became a person who can speak because people listen to me when I speak. I am already old, but I feel like I am only two years old! We have only been living like human beings for the two years after liberation. We can never let the American devils come and ruin us again." Halihan is a thirty-five-year-old middle-aged woman. She said indignantly, "In the past, we lived our lives naked, not daring to walk past the landlord's door. Now I have been emancipated, I have land, I am very willing to work, and I want to increase production tenfold to support the front lines." This is the common understanding and action of thousands of Uyghur people.

Dear Uyghur elders, brothers, and sisters, let our hearts be closely linked together, and let us advance shoulder to shoulder forever in the direction of victory!

    在喀什的日子
    ——献给新疆维吾尔族的兄弟姊妹们
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团西北分团团长  曲竟济
    在逗留喀什的日子里，我无时不被人们火热的感情激动着。我深深地感到，从朝鲜前线一直到祖国遥远的西方——帕米尔高原，被千山万水隔离着的人们，心都是紧紧地连结在一起的。
    当我乘着飞机越过崇峻的天山，穿过无边的戈壁沙漠时，我的心开始异样地激动。
    喀什到了。在这里，人们在沸腾着。十万人的欢迎行列，挤满了街巷和路旁。他们等待我们已经三天了。很多农民是从六十里外的乡镇赶来参加欢迎行列的。
    红旗在动，拳头在舞，人们在跳跃，歌唱，舞蹈，握手，献花。霎那间，我们被拥入人群，穿过红旗，迎着鲜花。人们放出了千百只和平鸽子，翱翔在热情的人海之上。老年人，年青人，妇女和儿童，干部和战士，工人和农民，学生和阿訇，都用同样深切的感情表示着他们对志愿军的热爱。虽然我们的语言不通，可是我们能用双手和眼睛来传递相互间的真挚感情。
    在短短的日子里，我深深地感触到，这里所有人的心都向往着朝鲜。这里的每一个人都是抗美援朝的坚强的战士。阿立曼是一个中年的妇女。她在听我做报告时，猛然地走近来，握住我的手，扑向我的怀里，激动地向我要求带她到朝鲜去，为朝鲜人民报仇。那一天，很多老大娘也都围向我、拉着我、抱住我，表示着要到朝鲜去的同样的决心。有的一面说话，一面失声痛哭。这种激昂悲愤的情感，激励着我保卫祖国、保卫和平的战士的意志，使我流下了热泪。
    人们的心像烈火般燃烧着。每次我们做报告后，总有成群的人请求到朝鲜去参加志愿军。在浩汉区，听报告的五万农民中，有一万零五百人请求到朝鲜去。亚普泉的四个青年，赶了六十里路跑来，坚决要求我们带他们到朝鲜去。最使人感动的是七十岁的老大娘阿西汗。她走了二十里路来请求允许她全家四口人一同参加志愿军。她说：“我年纪虽然老了，可是我也要到朝鲜去和美国鬼子拚。就是牺牲了，我也感到光荣。”当我向她进行了安慰和解释之后，她仍然恳求着：“我不能去，那无论如何要我的儿子去吧！”她等待着我的答复。我再次向她说明在家乡努力增加生产，也是抗美援朝的重要工作，希望她以生产的成绩来支援志愿军。她流出了眼泪，激动地回答：“我一定要积极生产，支援前线。”
    我同许多维吾尔族父老兄弟姊妹接触过，同他们谈过话。在这儿，“抗美援朝”已成为家喻户晓的事。谁都知道：“只有抗美援朝的最后胜利，才能保证过好解放后的幸福生活。”他们曾经捐献出心爱的牛、羊、马、骆驼和许多珍贵的物品，购买飞机大炮。他们正在从各方面努力增加生产，厉行节约，来支援中国人民志愿军。六十岁的农民乌守也来木对我说：“我过去是个不会说话的人，因为那时候没有我们说话的地方；解放了，我成了会说话的人了，因为我说话有人听了。我年纪已经老了，可是我觉得才只有两岁哩！解放后的两年，我们才过着人的日子。我们无论如何也不能让美国鬼子再来糟害我们。”哈里汗是一个三十五岁的中年妇女。她愤恨地说：“过去我们是赤着身子过日子，不敢在地主门前走过。现在我翻了身，我有了土地，我很愿意劳动，我要把生产提高十倍来支援前线。”这就是千万个维吾尔族人民共同的认识和行动。
    亲爱的维吾尔族父老兄弟姊妹们，让我们的心紧紧地连结在一起，向着胜利的方向，永远并肩前进！
