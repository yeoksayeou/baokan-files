    The Trade Union of the Central Railway Ministry
    Should Solve the Problem of Employee Sports Activities

    To the Editor: The headquarters of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Railways is an agency with thousands of employees, yet it lacks essential sports facilities. After Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Railway Ministry called for the development of sports activities the year before last, the agency's trade union repaired the sports field in order to select a representative team. Because the sports field was not managed, it was trampled on within a few days and has not been repaired to this day. Last year, after repeated requests from the employees, the trade union rented the Youth Service Department's ball court. However, after renting the ball court for two months, the trade union only paid for one month's rent, so the Youth Service Department refused to rent it out any longer. Employees playing ball in the courtyard or in the square in front of the gate is prohibited by our ministry's General Affairs Department. Now, employees have nowhere to engage in activities after work and can only engage in some activities on the dilapidated half of the ball court. We have requested basketballs and volleyballs from the trade union, but the comrades working in the trade union have repeatedly made excuses and ignored us. We don't know where the trade union has spent the cultural and educational funds. We have made many suggestions to the trade union, but they always emphasize difficulties and ignore them. We believe that the trade union has the responsibility to lead employees in sports activities to promote employee health. We urgently request a response from the trade union of the Railway Ministry and that appropriate solutions be made.

    中央铁道部机关工会
    应解决职工体育活动的问题
    编辑同志：中央人民政府铁道部本部是一个拥有数千职工的机关，却没有必需的体育设备。前年铁道部滕代远部长号召开展体育活动后，机关工会为了选拔代表队，把体育场修理了一下。体育场因无人管理，没有几天就被踏坏了，至今仍未修理。去年，经职工们多次请求，工会租用了青年服务部球场。但租用了两个月球场，工会却只付一个月租费，青年服务部因此不肯再出租了。职工在院子里或大门前广场上玩球，是为我部总务处所禁止的。现在，职工们业余无处活动，只好在破乱不堪的半个球场里面活动一下。我们曾向工会请求发给篮球和排球，作工会工作的同志却再三推托，毫不理睬。我们不知工会把文教费开支到那里去了。我们对工会提了许多次意见，但他们总是强调困难，置之不理。我们认为工会有责任领导职工进行体育活动，以促进职工的健康。我们迫切地要求铁道部机关工会给予答复，并作适当解决。
