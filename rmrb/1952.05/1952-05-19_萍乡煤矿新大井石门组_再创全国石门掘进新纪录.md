    Pingxiang Coal Mine Xin Da Well Rock Tunnel Team
    Sets New National Rock Tunneling Record Again
    Comrade Editor: The Xin Da Well Rock Tunnel Team of Pingxiang Coal Mine, on the basis of its first creation of a new national record of 15.15 meters for rock tunneling and its second creation of a new national record of 24.4 meters for rock tunneling, has now created a new national record of 29.6 meters per day. The main reason for this new record is that the rock transportation lane has a larger cross-section. In order to carry out simultaneous drilling and slag removal from two holes, they combined the rock transportation lane bottoming work from two steps into one, and deepened the blasting holes. This not only saved time, detonators, and explosives, but also created a new national record.

    萍乡煤矿新大井石门组
    再创全国石门掘进新纪录
    编辑同志：萍乡煤矿新大井石门组，在第一次创石门掘进十五公尺点一五的全国新纪录和第二次创石门掘进二十四公尺点四的全国新纪录的基础上，又创日进二十九公尺点六的全国新纪录。这次能够创造新纪录，主要是岩石运输道断面较大，他们为了进行两孔同时打眼出碴的工作，便把岩石运道起底工作从两次并作一次进行，并加深了炮眼。这不但节省了时间、雷管、炸药，而且创造了全国新纪录。
