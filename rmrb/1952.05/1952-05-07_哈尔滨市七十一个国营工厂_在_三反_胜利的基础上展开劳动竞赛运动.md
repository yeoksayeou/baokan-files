Harbin's seventy-one state-owned factories have launched a new labor emulation drive on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. According to statistics from eight industrial trade unions, thirty-eight factories out of forty in these eight industries have already joined the emulation movement. Although the emulation movement has just begun, it has already brought significant achievements. Among fifty-two factories, thirty-nine have completed and exceeded their first-quarter plans. Machine Tool Factory No. 10 completed its production task fourteen days ahead of schedule and exceeded the target by 12%.

After each factory focused its work on production, it mobilized and organized workers to universally revise their patriotic covenants. The workers' class consciousness was thus further enhanced, and they threw themselves into the emulation upsurge with unparalleled enthusiasm.

Workers Consciously Abide by Labor Discipline

Comrade Deng Xibin of the Pencil Company used to be very backward and did not abide by labor discipline, playing around with others while operating the machine. After education, his awareness was raised. He said, "Now I know that I am working for myself. I was really letting down Chairman Mao and our volunteers." Therefore, he brought his initiative into play in production, and his output increased from 450 jin of lead material per day to 1,500 jin. Workers at Electrical Engineering Factory No. 7, the Repair Shop, and other factories made self-criticisms and examined their mistakes in not abiding by labor discipline; some even wrote written self-criticisms and posted them on the blackboard newspapers. Some cadres in the Investigation Section and Collection Section of the Waterworks had very poor work attitudes and sense of responsibility in the past, only working for three hours a day, and even those three hours were not spent conscientiously. Some used the excuse of going on business trips to go home and sleep, or watch movies and plays. Now they have changed, going to work at six o'clock every day and going on business trips at eight o'clock, not returning to the factory until five o'clock in the afternoon. Therefore, work efficiency has significantly improved. Previously, each person collected 49 pieces per day, now it has increased to 99 pieces. In March, in addition to completing the March task, they also recovered 1.435 billion yuan in water fees that had not been collected in January and February.

Conscientiously Implement Operating Procedures, Strengthen and Improve Technical Management

The workers also consciously and earnestly implemented various rules and regulations, especially operating procedures. As a result, accidents and failures have been greatly reduced, and product quality has significantly improved. Due to the fact that the workers of the Enamel Insulated Wire Team of Electrical Engineering Factory No. 7 produce according to operating procedures, the quality has improved from 93% qualified to over 98%. Rubber Factory No. 6 has established a system of responsibility at all levels for quality, a shift handover system, a process responsibility system, a machine responsibility system, employee responsibility regulations for preservation, and a tool inspection system in the workshop. The team has also established regular technical research and a fifteen-minute team meeting every day after work to discuss production and quality issues of the day. As workers' technical level improved, product quality was also improved. In February, there were 811 pairs of second-class products and 122 pairs of defective products. In March, second-class products dropped to 516 pairs, and there were only three pairs of defective products. The Tannery has established a safety section system, with each worker assigned a certain area to be responsible for all safety matters. Workers in the repair workshop voluntarily proposed to go to work half an hour early to check the machines. Once, the axle tile in the first workshop came loose, but it was fortunately seen by worker Wang Jinfeng, who repaired it in time, preventing an accident.

Advanced experiences appeared in large numbers in the emulation movement. In order to ensure the completion of tasks, workers used their brains, found tricks, and created hundreds of advanced experiences. Workers in factories belonging to the Machine Manufacturing Trade Union alone created 181 items. These advanced experiences included inventions, technical improvements, improved operating methods, improved labor organization, and rationalization proposals in many areas.

Old worker Gao Yongjiang of the Tractor Repair Shop created a rubber pad making machine, which increased production efficiency six times and also guaranteed the safety of workers' bodies. Worker Bai Jinghe of the Leather Shoe Factory created a heel shaving machine, which can be done by two people what used to be done by one hundred people, increasing production efficiency fifty times.

The furnace team of the Railway Factory proposed a rationalization proposal to change three-inch raw materials to one-inch raw materials. Therefore, it changed from three fires to hit one, to one fire to hit one; in the past, thirty were hit a day, now more than one hundred can be hit a day. Workers in the Xinhua Printing Factory improved the paper cutting method and created the paper arranging method. In the past, each roll of paper was cut into 19,000 boxes, now it is cut into 20,000 boxes, saving 100 rolls of paper a year.

Changed the Backward Factories, Workshops, and Teams

In the emulation, with the efforts of all employees, new atmospheres have also appeared in backward factories, workshops, and teams. The Leather Shoe Factory was a factory that had consistently failed to complete its tasks. This time, it also completed the March task six days ahead of schedule, exceeding the first quarter by 15.4%, breaking the production record of previous years. Workers reflected, "In the past, no one cared about work stoppages, but now suggestions are resolved immediately when they are raised." The semi-finished product workshop of the Bristle Factory has historically never completed a production task, but in February it exceeded it by 5.5%, and in March it exceeded it by 11%. Liu Changlong, the leader of the furnace team of Electrical Engineering Factory No. 4, used to be the most backward, leading the workers to play during production time, taking out the fired work to cool before firing it again, just not hitting it. This time, his thinking changed, and he led all the workers in the team to start an emulation, improved the labor organization, changed from one furnace to two furnaces, and made specific divisions of labor for the entire team to establish a responsibility system. On March 13, he completed the entire month's task.

New Situations Require Timely Improvement of Production Management and Technical Management

With the deepening and development of the movement, some shortcomings in production management and technical management have also been exposed, such as some operating procedures that are no longer suitable and have not been able to adapt to this new situation, and have not been revised in a timely manner. There are also raw material supply problems that should be resolved to avoid work stoppages and waiting for materials in many factories. As advanced experiences appear in large numbers, the issue of rewards should also be resolved. Sufficient attention must be paid to the above issues, and solutions must be sought quickly, in order to consolidate the results, overcome shortcomings, and continue to move forward.

    哈尔滨市七十一个国营工厂
    在“三反”胜利的基础上展开劳动竞赛运动
    哈尔滨市七十一个国营工厂，在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，展开了新的劳动竞赛运动。据八个产业工会统计，这八个产业的四十个工厂，已有三十八个工厂卷入竞赛运动。竞赛运动虽然刚刚开始，但是，已经带来了重大的成就。在五十二个工厂中，就有三十九个工厂完成和超过了第一季度计划。机械十厂提前十四天完成了生产任务，并超过任务百分之十二。
    各厂把工作重点放到生产上以后，即发动和组织职工，普遍地修订了爱国公约。工人的阶级觉悟因而更加提高，以无比的热情投入竞赛热潮。
    工人自觉地遵守劳动纪律
    铅笔公司邓喜滨工友，过去很落后，不遵守劳动纪律，一面开着机器一面和别人闹着玩。经过教育，提高了觉悟。他说：“这回可知道是给自己干活了，我过去真对不起毛主席和咱的志愿军。”因此，他便在生产上发挥了积极性，产量由以前一天压四百五十斤铅料子，提高到一千五百斤。电工七厂、修配厂等工人们都做了自我批评，检讨了不遵守劳动纪律的错误；有的还写出书面检讨，贴在黑板报上。自来水厂调查股和收款股的部分干部，过去工作态度、责任心是很差的，一天仅能做三小时工作，而且就是三小时也不老老实实做工作，有的藉口出差而回家睡觉，或看电影、看戏。现在他们转变了，每天都是六点上班，八点多钟就出差，直到下午五点才回厂。因此，工作效率显著地提高了，以前每人一天收四十九件，现提高到九十九件。三月份除完成三月份任务外，还把一、二月份未收的水费十四亿三千五百万元收了回来。
    认真执行操作规程，加强和改进了技术管理
    工友们也自觉地认真地执行了各种规程制度，特别是操作规程。因而，事故、故障大大地减少，产品质量显著提高。电工七厂漆皮线小组，由于工友们都按操作规程生产，质量由百分之九十三合格提高到百分之九十八以上。橡胶六厂在车间建立了质量层层负责制、交接班制、过程负责制、机器负责制、保全职工责任条例、工具检查制度等。小组内也建立了定期技术研究和每天下班十五分钟小组会，讨论当天生产和质量问题。工人技术水平提高了，产品质量就改进了。二月份二等品八百十一双，废品一百二十二双。三月份二等品降到五百十六双，废品只三双。制革厂建立了安全分段制，每个工友都划分一定地盘，负责一切安全事宜。修理车间工友自动提出提前半点钟上班，检查机器。有一次第一车间轴瓦活落了，幸被工友王金峰看见，及时修理好，没发生事故。
    先进经验大批出现在竞赛运动中，工人们为了保证任务完成，便动脑筋，找窍门，创造了数以百计的先进经验。仅机器制造工会所属各厂工人就创造了一百八十一件。这些先进经验是包括发明创造、技术改进、改进操作方法、改善劳动组织、合理化建议等多方面的。
    拖拉机修配厂高永江老工友创造了制胶垫机，提高了生产效率六倍，并且还保证了工友身体的安全。皮鞋厂白景和工友创造了削后掌机器，一百个人干的活，两个人即可干，提高生产效率五十倍。
    铁路工厂烘炉小组提出合理化建议，把三寸原料改为一寸原料。因此，由三火打一个，提高到一火打一个；过去一天打三十个，现在一天能打一百多个。新华印刷厂工友，改进了裁纸法，创造了编纸法，过去每匹纸裁一万九千个盒，现在裁二万盒，一年可节省一百匹纸。
    改变了落后的工厂、车间、小组
    在竞赛中，在全体职工努力下，落后的工厂、车间、小组也出现了新的气象。皮鞋厂是一贯完不成任务的工厂，这次也提前六天完成了三月份任务，第一季度超过百分之十五点四，打破了历年来的生产纪录。工友反映：“过去停工没人管，现在意见提上去马上解决。”猪鬃工厂半成品车间，历史上没有一次完成过生产任务，在二月份超过百分之五点五，三月份超过百分之十一。电工四厂烘炉小组，组长刘昌隆以前最落后，生产的时间领着工友玩，烧好的活拿出来凉凉了再烧，就是不打，这回他的思想转变了，领导全组工友搞起竞赛，改善了劳动组织，由一盘炉，改成两盘，全组进行具体分工，建立专责制，三月十三日便全部完成了全月任务。
    新的情况要求及时改进生产管理、技术管理
    随着运动的深入和发展，也暴露出在生产管理、技术管理上还存在着一些缺点，如某些操作规程已不合适，还没有能够适应这种新的情况，及时进行修订。还有原材料供应问题，也应解决，以免使许多工厂发生停工待料现象。先进经验大批出现，奖励问题也应解决。对于以上这些问题，必须予以足够的重视，迅速求得解决，以便巩固成果，克服缺点，继续前进。（本报特约记者吴宏毅）
