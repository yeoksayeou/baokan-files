    Korean Central News Agency Denounces US Plot to Delay Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 27th] The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on May 23rd entitled "The US Side Has Absolutely No Qualification to Talk About Sincerity in the Armistice Negotiations," stating that the absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal that the US side has repeatedly insisted upon at the Korean armistice negotiations has long lost any basis today. However, the US representatives in Panmunjom have not abandoned their arrogant attitude and are still shamelessly creating plots to delay the negotiations.
    The commentary pointed out that the US side is still continuing to trample on international conventions, coercing our captured personnel to agree to "voluntary repatriation," and is still perpetrating atrocities of massacring our captured personnel. Following the Dodd incident, a series of events that occurred on Geoje Island, the bloodshed that occurred in the US POW camps on Geoje Island on the 16th and 17th, and the tragic massacres of our captured personnel in the Busan POW camp on the 20th, once again exposed the bloody atrocities of the US side; In particular, the fact that the US side massacred a large number of our captured personnel in the Busan POW camp, and the cruel suppression methods adopted by Bonner, the head of the US POW camp on Geoje Island, have more clearly exposed the US side's unwillingness to implement its promise to "improve the treatment of prisoners of war," and its ferocious face of deliberately massacring our captured personnel on a large scale.
    The commentary emphasized that such perfidious and extremely vicious behavior of the American aggressors shows that they have no sincerity in breaking the deadlock in the Korean armistice negotiations, nor have they abandoned their intention to sabotage the armistice negotiations. If the US side continues to stubbornly adhere to this rogue and disgraceful attitude, then it will inevitably be cursed and resolutely opposed by all freedom-loving people around the world. If the US side still insists on its unreasonable proposal and continues to use its false and fabricated tricks, then there will be no progress in the negotiations; Does the US side have the qualification to talk about "sincerity" in the discussions of the armistice negotiations?

    朝鲜中央通讯社斥美方拖延谈判阴谋
    【新华社二十七日讯】朝鲜中央通讯社二十三日以“美方在停战谈判中根本没有资格侈言什么诚意”为题发表评论称：美方在朝鲜停战谈判会议上所一再坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬“提案”，到今天早已没有任何根据了。但是板门店的美方代表仍未放弃他们的狂妄态度，仍在无耻地制造着拖延谈判的阴谋。
    评论指出，现在美方仍在继续蹂躏着国际公约，强迫我方被俘人员赞成“自愿遣返”，并仍在制造着残杀我方被俘人员的暴行。在杜德事件之后，发生在巨济岛的一连串事件，与十六、十七两日发生在巨济岛美方战俘营中的流血事件，以及二十日我方被俘人员在釜山战俘营被大批虐杀的惨案，再次揭穿了美方的血腥暴行；特别是美方在釜山战俘营大批虐杀我方被俘人员的事实，与巨济岛美方战俘营负责人波纳所采用的残酷镇压手段，已更加清楚地暴露了美方不肯实行其“改善战俘待遇”的诺言，与蓄意大批杀害我方被俘人员的凶恶面貌。
    评论强调说，美国侵略者这种背信弃义、穷凶极恶的行为，表明他们并没有打破朝鲜停战谈判僵局的诚意，也没有放弃其破坏停战谈判的意图。如果美方继续固执这种无赖可耻的态度，那么它就一定要受到全世界爱好自由人民的同声诅咒与坚决反对。美方假如还要坚持其无理的方案，继续使用其虚伪捏造的伎俩，那么谈判就不会有任何进展；美方在停战谈判的讨论中，难道还有侈言“诚意”的资格吗？
