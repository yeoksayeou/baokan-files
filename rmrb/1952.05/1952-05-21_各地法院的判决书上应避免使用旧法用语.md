	Avoid Using Old Legal Terminology in Judgments of Courts at All Levels

	Editor: Currently, many court judgments still use terminology from the old Six Codes. For example, some civil and criminal judgments of the East China Branch of the Supreme People's Court often contain terms like "force majeure," "whether a legal person," "both parties," "no-fault liability," "no room for shirking responsibility," "obligation to pay," "transferring one's own losses to others," "to ensure fairness," "grounds for appeal," "undisputed," "no binding force," "dispute," and so on. Similar terminology can also be found in the judgments of other courts.

	The people's laws are for the people, first and foremost for the working people. Therefore, judgments must be written in a popular and easy-to-understand manner so that the broad masses of workers and peasants can understand the content of the judgment. The aforementioned old legal terminology is incomprehensible to workers and peasants. Some farmers have to travel miles to find someone to explain the content of the judgment.

	Therefore, I suggest that relevant staff in the judicial departments no longer use old legal terminology.　Deng Tinghuan

### 各地法院的判决书上应避免使用旧法用语

    各地法院的判决书上应避免使用旧法用语
    编辑同志：现在，还有不少法院的判决书上，沿用着旧六法全书中的用语。如最高人民法院华东分院的一些民刑判决书上，常有“不可抗力”、“是否法人”、“两造”、“无过失赔偿责任”、“无诿卸余地”、“给付责任”、“将自己的损失转嫁于人”、“以昭平允”、“上诉意旨”、“毋庸争辩”、“无拘束力”、“讼争”等等用语。其他法院的判决书上，也可以看到这类用语。
    人民的法律是为人民服务的，首先是为劳动人民服务的，因此，判决书就必须写得通俗、易懂，才能使广大工农群众明白判决的内容。上述旧法用语，工农群众是看不懂的。有的农民为了弄明白判决内容，竟跑到几里外去找人解释。
    因此，我建议司法部门有关工作人员不要再使用旧法用语。　邓庭焕
