    Completion of the Banqiao Reservoir on the Huai River Frees Three Million Mu of Farmland from Flooding
    Construction of the Fozi Ridge Giant Reservoir Project to Enter Intense Stage

    The Banqiao Reservoir, located on the upper reaches of the Ru River, a tributary of the Huai River, was completed this year on May 1st Labor Day. This is the second flood-retention reservoir completed in the Huai River harnessing project, following the ShimanTan Reservoir. This reservoir is located in Miyang County, Henan Province, with a storage capacity of 240 million cubic meters. After the reservoir impounds water and the river channels are dredged, three million mu of farmland in the Ru River basin will be protected from flooding, and 200,000 mu of farmland can also be irrigated.
    This reservoir is a valley reservoir, and its structures include an earth dam 1,700 meters long and 23.5 meters high across two mountains, a water diversion tunnel, and a spillway. The total earth and stone work for the above projects is about three million cubic meters, and it took more than a year to build, starting at the end of March last year. However, after May last year, due to the busy farming season, only a small number of migrant workers and some technicians were working on the construction site, excavating the tunnel of the water diversion tunnel and repairing the spillway. The construction was expanded in October last year, and at that time, there were 57,000 migrant workers. This spring, in order to rush the construction of the dam, the number of migrant workers from seven nearby counties participating in the construction, as well as workers and technicians from cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou, increased to more than 150,000. The construction used 118 sets of various machines such as shovel trucks, bulldozers, and water pumps, and more than 4,000 tons of various materials.
    This reservoir was completed ahead of schedule in order to celebrate May 1st Labor Day, thanks to the selfless labor of the above-mentioned technical personnel, workers, and migrant workers. More than 5,000 labor models emerged among all employees during the construction. On May 1st, the project headquarters and all employees held a warm and solemn celebration ceremony for the completion of the reservoir, and labor models and meritorious personnel were rewarded at the meeting.

    The Fozi Ridge giant reservoir project on the upper reaches of the Pi River is about to enter a stage of intense construction. The dam foundation cleaning work for the hollow dam has been largely completed, and preparations are now being made to build the hollow dam. More than 10,000 workers, migrant workers, engineering technicians, and working cadres participating in the construction project are working with unparalleled enthusiasm in the patriotic labor emulation campaign, striving to start the concrete pouring of the dam foundation by the end of May.
    The main construction projects for the Fozi Ridge Reservoir this spring are to remove 450,000 cubic meters of mud and deteriorated rock from the dam foundation of the hollow dam, build a cofferdam capable of withstanding a flood flow of 1,000 cubic meters per second, and build sheds, erect power lines, install machinery, and pave roads. At present, the cofferdam, which is 320 meters long and 6 meters high, is nearing completion. Piling workers have used Soviet-style pile drivers to drive in 650 steel sheet piles; after driving in another 150 steel sheet piles, the piling task will be completed. Road construction workers have also built a 3.5-mile-long road on the hillside. Workers from the exploration team are continuing to drill on the construction site to study geological conditions. Engineering technicians are continuing to survey the terrain of the reservoir and further design various reservoir construction projects. 1,200 rooms have also been built on the construction site for housing, offices, factories, and warehouses. With the start-up of the power plant, the mechanical repair plant and the electric sawmill have also started operation.
    In this spring's construction project, the Fozi Ridge Reservoir Project Headquarters also mobilized wooden boats with a load capacity of 5,000 tons, more than 160 trucks, and 150 horse-drawn carts from the Pi River basin to transport machinery and large equipment and materials from all over the country to the construction site by land and water. More than 300,000 cubic meters of stones and yellow sand used for mixing concrete are being mined locally. A section of the 25-kilometer-long light rail track laid to supply transportation equipment has now been completed.
    Now, on the Fozi Ridge Reservoir construction site, whether on the hillside or at the foot of the mountain, workers and migrant workers are working hard everywhere, and at night, tens of thousands of lights illuminate the area like daytime. Various projects are being intensified day and night.

    淮河板桥水库竣工三百万亩农田可免水患
    佛子岭巨型水库工程即将进入紧张施工阶段
    淮河支流汝河上游的板桥水库已在今年“五一”劳动节竣工。这是根治淮河工程中继石漫滩水库之后修成的第二个蓄洪水库。这个水库在河南省泌阳县境内，蓄水量为二亿四千万立方公尺。水库蓄水再加以河道整理之后，汝河流域的三百万亩农田就可免除水患，其中有二十万亩农田还可得到灌溉。
    这个水库是个山谷水库，建筑物包括两山之间的一座一千七百公尺长、二十三点五公尺高的拦河土坝和一个输水道、一个溢洪道。以上工程土方加石方共约三百万公方，从去年三月底开始前后修了一年多。但去年五月以后因为农忙，只有少数民工和一些技术工人在工地上开凿输水道的隧洞和修溢洪道，去年十月才扩大施工，当时民工达五万七千人。今年春季为了赶修拦河大坝，参加修工的附近七个县的民工，和来自上海、南京、广州等城市的工人和技术人员增加到了十五万多人。施工所用的铲运机、推土机、抽水机等各式机械达一百一十八部，各种器材达四千多吨。
    这个水库是在上述技术人员、工人和民工的忘我劳动下，为了庆祝“五一”节提前修成的。全体员工在施工中前后涌现出了五千多名劳动模范。“五一”节那天，工程指挥部和全体员工，热烈地和隆重地举行了水库落成的庆祝典礼，劳动模范和有功人员在会上都得到了奖励。（新华社）
    ?河上游的佛子岭巨型水库工程，即将进入紧张施工阶段。空心拦河大坝的坝基清理工作已大部完成，现正准备修筑空心拦河坝。参加修建工程的一万多名工人、民工、工程技术人员和工作干部，都在爱国主义劳动竞赛运动中，无比热情地劳动着，争取在五月底开始作坝基的浇灌混凝土工作。
    今年春季，修建佛子岭水库的主要工程是清除空心拦河坝坝基的四十五万公方泥土和变质的岩层，修筑一条足以抵挡一千秒立方公尺洪水流量的围堰，以及搭设工棚，架设电线，安装机器和铺修公路等。现在，三百二十公尺长、六公尺高的围堰已快筑成。打桩工人利用苏联式打桩机，已打下六百五十块钢板桩；再打下一百五十块钢板桩，就可全部完成打桩任务。开山工人也已在山腰间修好一条三里半长的公路。钻探队的工人还在工地上继续钻探，研究地质情况。工程技术人员仍在继续测绘水库地形，进一步设计各项建库工程。工地上还修好住房、办公房和工厂、仓库等一千二百间。随着发电厂的开动，机械修配厂、电动锯木厂都已开工。
    今春修建工程中，佛子岭水库工程指挥部又动员了?河流域载重量达五千吨的木船和一百六十多辆汽车、一百五十辆马车，把来自全国各地的机械和庞大的器材、物料，水陆兼程向工地上赶运。拌和混凝土用的三十多万公方石子和黄沙正在就地开采。为供应运输器材而铺设的二十五公里长的轻便铁轨现已铺好一段。
    现在，佛子岭水库工地上，无论在山腰上或山脚下，到处是紧张劳动的工人和民工，入晚，万盏灯光照耀如昼。各项工程都在昼夜不停地加紧施工。
