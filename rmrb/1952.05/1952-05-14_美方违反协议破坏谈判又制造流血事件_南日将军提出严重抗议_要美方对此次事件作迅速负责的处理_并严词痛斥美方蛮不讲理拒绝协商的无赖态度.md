Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 13th: On the morning of May 12th at 11:30, a U.S. military aircraft seriously violated the agreement and repeatedly strafed, with machine guns, supply vehicles of our delegation to the armistice negotiations traveling between Pyongyang and Kaesong, in the area of Longhyeon-ri, north of Heungsu. Li Dong-su, a staff member of our delegation, was killed by the bullets. At the delegation meeting on the 13th, our chief delegate, General Nam Il, lodged a serious protest regarding the latest serious bloody incident in which the U.S. violated the agreement and destroyed the negotiations, demanding the other side make a swift and responsible handling of this incident. The full text of the protest is as follows:

“On the morning of May 12th, around 11:30, one of your military aircraft near Longhyeon-ri, north of Heungsu, attacked supply trucks of our delegation, clearly marked with red flags, traveling from Pyongyang to Kaesong, and carried out low-altitude strafing. One staff member of our delegation was killed by bullets. This is another serious bloody incident in which your side violated the agreement and destroyed the negotiations. Since November 26th of last year, when both sides re-established the agreement on traffic safety between Kaesong and Pyongyang, your side has repeatedly violated the agreement. The serious incident on April 5th, when your military aircraft attacked vehicles of our delegation, injuring nine of our staff members, has not yet been resolved, and now the even more serious bloody incident of May 12th has occurred. Recently, your military aircraft have continuously intruded into the airspace over the conference area and have repeatedly bombed and strafed our prisoner-of-war camps. This series of continuous incidents cannot but make us suspect that your side is attempting to fundamentally overturn all agreements reached and destroy the basis for negotiations. I must point out to you the seriousness of the May 12th incident. I lodge a serious protest with your side and demand that your side take swift and responsible action to handle this incident.”

On the one hand, the U.S. side continuously carries out provocative incidents outside the conference to violate the agreement and destroy the negotiations; on the other hand, it adopts a stubborn attitude of refusing to negotiate, refusing to reason, and refusing to discuss our reasonable compromise proposal of May 2nd at the negotiation meetings, while shamelessly talking about "humanitarian principles," "individual rights," and "facing the facts." General Nam Il sternly pointed out at the meeting on the 13th: “It is your side that dares not face the facts. The fact is that your side has long been deliberately and consistently insisting on forcibly detaining a large number of our captured personnel. For a long time, you have been continuously using and condoning the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and using Syngman Rhee's agents to coerce our captured personnel into ‘refusing repatriation’ by means of forced tattooing, writing blood letters, and forcibly taking fingerprints, etc., using barbaric medieval methods, and even using collective massacres to create the ‘results of screening’ that you desire. We and peace-loving people all over the world will never forget the facts of the bloody tragedies caused by your forcing our captured personnel to ‘refuse repatriation’ on Geoje Island on February 18th and March 13th. The righteous demands put forward by our captured personnel in order to safeguard their inalienable rights have exposed to the people of the world your heinous and inhumane atrocities, exposed the truth that you are attempting to detain our captured personnel as cannon fodder and permanent slaves under the guise of ‘voluntary repatriation,’ and confirmed that the screening activities you are forcibly carrying out are simply forcing our captured personnel to accept your forced detention under violence. Apart from your accomplices, who else can say that there is any manifestation of free will and the right to free choice in the prisoner-of-war camps under your control, and who else thinks that it is necessary to review the so-called screening results you have manufactured after a bloodbath? The fact is that your side has repeatedly declared that it abides by the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, but you have always insisted on the unprecedented absurd proposition of 'voluntary repatriation' for the purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. You insist on depriving prisoners of war of the right to be repatriated after the armistice, you refuse to fulfill the obligation to repatriate prisoners of war, and you actually deny the desire of the prisoners of war on your own side to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families. The fact is that since the discussion of the prisoner-of-war issue, the words spoken by the representative who acted as your spokesperson can be disregarded, going back on your words and eating your own words. The fact is that since the resumption of the conference, your side has been refusing to reason, refusing to negotiate, and has been playing all kinds of rogue tricks inside and outside the conference in an attempt to force our side to accept your unilateral and unreasonable plan. You ignore these iron facts, so what qualifications do you have to talk about 'facing the facts'? I tell you clearly and unambiguously: If you dare to face the facts, you must abandon your attempt to detain our captured personnel, you must fulfill the obligation to repatriate prisoners of war, you must keep your word, and you must change your unreasonable and intimidating attitude."

    美方违反协议破坏谈判又制造流血事件
    南日将军提出严重抗议
    要美方对此次事件作迅速负责的处理
    并严词痛斥美方蛮不讲理拒绝协商的无赖态度
    【新华社开城十三日电】五月十二日上午十一时三十分美方军用飞机一架，严重违反协议，在兴水以北龙岘里地方，以机枪连续数次扫射我方停战谈判代表团行驶于平壤开城间的供应车辆。我方代表团工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲。我方首席代表南日将军在十三日代表团大会上，就美方违反协议破坏谈判的又一次严重流血事件，提出严重抗议，要求对方对此次事件作迅速负责的处理。抗议全文如下：
    “五月十二日上午十一时三十分左右，你方军用飞机一架在兴水以北龙岘里附近袭击自平壤驶来开城的带有明显红旗标志的我方代表团供应卡车，进行低空扫射，我代表团工作人员一名中弹牺牲，这是你方违反协议破坏谈判的又一次严重流血事件。自从去年十一月二十六日双方再次达成开城、平壤间交通安全协议之后，你方不断发生违犯协议事件。四月五日你方军用飞机袭击我代表团车辆，伤我方工作人员九名的严重事件尚未处理，竟又发生五月十二日的更为严重的流血事件。最近以来你方军用飞机不断侵入会场区上空，多次轰炸扫射我方战俘营。这一系列连续发生的事件，不能不使我们怀疑你方是否企图根本推翻已达成的一切协议，破坏进行谈判的基础。我必须向你方指出五月十二日事件的严重性，我向你方提出严重抗议，并要求你方对此次事件作迅速负责的处理。”
    美方一方面在会外连续不断地进行违反协议破坏谈判的挑衅事件；另一方面又在谈判会议上采取拒绝协商、拒绝说理、拒绝讨论我方五月二日合理折衷方案的横蛮态度，而却厚颜无耻地恣谈“人道原则”，“个人权利”，“面对事实”。南日将军在十三日的会上严词指出：“不敢面对事实的正是你方。事实就是你方蓄意已久而一直坚持强迫扣留我方大批的被俘人员。长时期以来，你们就不断利用并纵容蒋介石匪帮和使用李承晚的特务，在我方被俘人员中用强迫刺字、代写血书、强打指印等等中世纪的野蛮办法，胁迫我方被俘人员‘拒绝遣返’，甚至使用集体屠杀来制造你们所希望的‘甄别的结果’。二月十八日和三月十三日巨济岛上，你方强迫我方被俘人员‘拒绝遣返’所造成的血腥惨案的事实，我们和全世界爱好和平的人们是永远不会忘记的。我方被俘人员为了维护他们不容剥夺的权利，所提出的义正词严的要求，向全世界人民暴露了你方令人发指的惨无人道的暴行，揭穿了你方假借‘自愿遣返’之名，企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰与永久奴役的真相，证实了你方所强迫进行的根本不能容许的甄别活动，只是在暴力之下，强使我方被俘人员接受你方的强迫扣留。除了你方的同谋者以外，还有谁能说在你方控制的战俘营中存在着什么自由意志的表现和自由选择的权利，还有谁认为需要对你方所制造的经过血洗的所谓甄别结果再进行审查。事实就是你方一再宣称遵守日内瓦战俘公约，可是你们一直坚持以强迫扣留战俘为目的的‘自愿遣返’的史无前例的荒谬主张。你们坚持剥夺停战之后战俘应被遣返的权利，你们拒绝履行遣返战俘的义务，你们事实上也否定了你们自己一方的被俘人员返回家乡与其家人团聚的愿望。事实就是讨论战俘问题以来，作为你方发言人的代表讲了的话可以不算，出尔反尔，自食其言。事实就是大会复会以来，你方一直拒绝说理，拒绝协商，并在会内会外耍弄各种无赖伎俩，企图强迫我方接受你们片面无理的方案。你们把这些铁的事实推开不管，你还有什么资格来谈什么‘面对事实’。我明白无误的告诉你：你们如果敢于面对事实，你们就必须放弃扣留我方被俘人员的企图，你们就必须履行遣返战俘的义务，你们就必须说了话算话，你们就必须改变你们那种蛮不讲理的恫吓态度。”
