Work Summary of the North China Material Exchange Conference
North China Material Exchange Conference Working Committee

In order to further strengthen material exchange and invigorate urban and rural economies on the basis of the victories of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, we convened the North China Material Exchange Conference on April 23, according to the decision of the North China Economic Conference. This conference closed on May 21, lasting 28 days. Attendees included small trade delegations from the five provinces and two cities of North China, Inner Mongolia, and major administrative regions, totaling 109 units. All municipalities and most special districts in North China provinces, as well as leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia, sent small trade delegations to participate in the conference for trading. Thanks to the correct leadership of the North China Administrative Committee, the active support of provinces, cities, and major administrative regions, and the active work of all conference staff, the conference has successfully achieved its expected goals. The main gains are as follows:

(1) A total of 2,801 contracts and agreements were signed, organizing 745.434 billion yuan in transactions. Contracts accounted for 83.9% of the total transaction amount, and agreements accounted for 16.1%. Traded commodities were mainly agricultural, sideline, local, and special products, accounting for 81.8% of the total transaction amount, followed by urban industrial products, accounting for 18.2%. From an economic composition perspective, state-owned enterprises accounted for 76.5% of the total procurement transaction amount and 39.3% of the total sales transaction amount, cooperatives accounted for 16.7% of the total procurement transaction amount and 57.7% of the total sales transaction amount, and private enterprises accounted for 6.8% of the total procurement transaction amount and 3% of the total sales transaction amount. This situation demonstrates the leading role of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives. Among the large-scale transactions of local and special products, there were 163,800 bolts of native cloth, 520,000 mats, 3.3 million jin of various medicinal materials, 12,000 tons of fertilizer, 142,000 head of fattened pigs, and 22,000 pieces of agricultural implements. The large-scale transaction of urban industrial products was for various colored fine cloth, totaling 133,000 bolts. The total value of daily necessities traded was 32.4 billion yuan.

Through the above-mentioned large volume of transactions, the temporarily stagnant phenomenon of the North China urban and rural economy will be greatly overcome. Local and special products have been largely sold out. A portion of the stockpiled industrial products has been sold. This has played a certain role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, some new trade relations have also been established through this conference. For example, pig iron and ironware from Shanxi Province, and dried shrimp from Hebei Province, were sold as far as Guangxi Province.

(2) Many of the supply and marketing problems that disaster-stricken farmers needed to solve were addressed at this conference, which greatly helped and guided production in disaster areas. For example, Baodi County in the Tianjin Special District and Yutian County in the Tangshan Special District of Hebei Province had stockpiled approximately 30,000 pairs of shoes and shoe soles produced by women from last winter to this spring, which were all sold through this conference. Another example is that the mats produced in the Baiyangdian area of the Baoding Special District of Hebei Province, a disaster area, had a serious backlog in the past, making it impossible to continue production. Through this conference, 275,000 mats were sold, exchanged for a large amount of fertilizer, and solved the production problems of 36,000 mat-weaving residents in 130 villages in the area. Because the conference solved many supply and marketing problems for the people in the disaster areas, the representatives from the disaster areas expressed their satisfaction.

(3) Past contracts and agreements were reviewed, and contract credit was further established. According to this inspection, the implementation of the 3,672 contracts and 534 agreements signed at the 1951 North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition was generally good. 87% of the contracts have been implemented, and 45% of the agreements have been implemented. Cancelled contracts accounted for 1%, and agreements accounted for 5%. This shows that the contracts signed at last year's North China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Exhibition were relatively close to the actual production and sales situation. Among the unfulfilled contracts and agreements, in addition to those that have not yet expired, the reasons for non-fulfillment are: either due to a lack of understanding of the production and sales situation, resulting in blindly signing contracts; or due to price changes, with relevant parties feeling unprofitable; or because the traded goods did not meet standard specifications, etc.; and the most fundamental reason is that some units disregard the seriousness and legality of contracts and do not abide by contract credit. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems in the execution of contracts and agreements, the conference specifically established a Contract and Agreement Inspection Committee to supervise the implementation of past contracts and convert past agreements into contracts to further confirm them. A total of 139 contract and agreement dispute issues were submitted to the conference for resolution, of which 100 were resolved through mediation and arbitration by the conference's Contract and Agreement Inspection Committee, accounting for 71% of the total number of cases, worth over 168.5 billion yuan. Among them, 28 agreements were converted into contracts, worth over 139.1 billion yuan. 53 cases were executed according to the original terms and conditions with adjustments to prices and quantities after persuasion by the committee, worth 24.7 billion yuan. 19 cases were approved for cancellation, worth 4.7 billion yuan. Through this inspection and review work, contract credit was maintained, the shortcomings of blindly signing contracts in the past were corrected, and everyone further realized the seriousness and legal responsibility of contracts. Therefore, at this conference, all units were more cautious when signing contracts. This provided a strong guarantee for the execution of the contracts and agreements signed this time.

The reasons for achieving the above results:

1.  The correct trading policy was implemented, and flexible trading methods were adopted. The trading policy of this conference was: "Consider both public and private interests, help each other in urban and rural areas, have both buying and selling, buy more and sell more, combine buying and selling." The implementation of this policy played a significant role in correcting trading ideas and organizing a large number of transactions. At the beginning of the conference, trade delegations from various places generally held the one-sided view of "only selling and not buying" or "selling more and buying less" because they only saw their own commodity stockpiles and difficulties in circulating funds. The conference promptly criticized this ideological bias, explaining that it violated the laws of trade and could not achieve the purpose of trade. It called on all trade delegations to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual benefit and implement the above-mentioned trading policy. This quickly opened up the situation of mutual observation at that time. At the same time, the conference adopted a variety of trading methods such as spot goods and cash, spot goods and deferred payment, cash and futures, sales on credit, entrusted purchase and sale, joint purchase and joint sale, old agreements changing into new contracts, and barter trade, so that trade delegations from various places could still transact large volumes despite insufficient funds. For private enterprises, the various state-owned economic departments participating in the conference implemented the policy of considering both public and private interests, and made necessary driving and care for private enterprises in terms of business operation methods, price issues, and the distribution of transactions of the same commodity. In addition, the simplification of transaction procedures also facilitated the organization of a large number of transactions in a short period of time.

2.  Political and ideological leadership was strengthened, and the enthusiasm and initiative of trade delegations from various places were promoted. At the beginning of the conference, some cadres and representatives showed timidity and did not dare to boldly carry out transactions. In response to this situation, the conference clearly pointed out that: "Three-Anti" is to oppose the "three evils," especially to oppose corruption. As long as there are no "three evils," doing more business is serving the people more, so it is wrong to be constrained and not dare to take responsibility. After such criticism and explanation, the concerns of some cadres were dispelled, and they were able to actively carry out business. The conference also conducted policy and ideological education for private business representatives, explaining that as long as they remove the "five poisons" and conduct business within the scope of the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government, they still have reasonable profits and prospects for development, in order to organize them to participate in the conference. In addition, the conference also conducted appropriate political mobilization and strengthened patriotic ideological education. For example, combined with welcoming the "May Day" Labor Day, a patriotic competition movement was launched to do more business, thereby organizing more than 200 billion yuan in transactions within just three days.

3.  Relatively meticulous organizational work was carried out. According to actual needs, the conference established a Contract and Agreement Inspection Committee, a Local Products Department, a General Merchandise Department, a Livestock Products and Oil Department, and a Service Department, and implemented the principle that everyone has a specific responsibility and everything has a specific person to do. In organizing transactions, the conference planned and proactively organized various units to exchange information with each other, and grasped the meeting of heads of trade delegations, with the conference leading cadres personally grasping and correcting obstacles and biases occurring in business at any time, so that many transactions could be concluded. At the same time, the conference focused on organizing off-site seminars and various professional meetings to cooperate with on-site transactions. In terms of contract and agreement inspection and handling, the conference adopted four forms: (1) organizing both parties to negotiate, with the conference sending people to participate in mediation, which was the main form; (2) organizing both parties to negotiate on their own, which was used for minor issues; (3) organizing both parties to negotiate and inviting a third party to assist in mediation; (4) convening a meeting of trade delegations to democratically discuss and resolve the issue of individual units that refused to execute the contract. Because this mass line approach was adopted, many disputes over the execution of contracts and agreements could be resolved in a relatively short period of time.

4.  After the education and transformation of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, coupled with the conference's repeated emphasis on abiding by contract credit, all units have begun to establish a new trading attitude. When conducting transactions, they are generally more honest and responsible, gradually achieving their word is their bond, genuine goods at fair prices, and carefully signing contracts. State-owned trade and cooperatives trust and rely on each other, and their business ties are closer. For example, state-owned trade signed 24 purchase contracts with cooperatives at this conference, totaling 270.1 billion yuan, which played a significant role in supporting cooperatives and ensuring state procurement and export tasks.

Based on the experience of this conference, the following suggestions are made for organizing material exchange work in the future:

1.  Relevant departments and units should understand the production and sales situation in various places at any time, and formulate production and sales plans. This is the main link in conducting trade work in a planned way. Only by understanding the production and sales situation can the signed contracts and agreements not fail, and can we conduct transactions with confidence. Some units at this conference were unable to transact well with others because they did not have enough understanding of the production and sales situation.

2.  In order to consolidate the achievements of the Material Exchange Conference, it is hoped that districts, provinces, cities, special districts, and counties will establish institutions for inspecting contracts and agreements under the leadership of the local Financial and Economic Committee, so as to promptly inspect and supervise the implementation of contracts and agreements. In principle, all contracts are not allowed to be torn up. In the event of unauthorized tearing up, compensation, penalties, or imprisonment and other sanctions should be given as appropriate.

3.  This type of conference is a new form of material circulation, which can play a significant role in promoting the export or domestic sale of local products. We suggest that all regions hold such conferences regularly in a planned way. Provinces, cities, special districts, and counties can also hold small-scale material exchange meetings by region to enhance the short-distance mass material exchange in various places.

4.  At present, the vast rural areas urgently need production materials such as agricultural implements and pesticides. We suggest that major cities plan to develop the production of pesticides and agricultural implements. Small and medium-sized cities should plan to establish small agricultural implement factories to meet the needs of agricultural production.

5.  We suggest that relevant departments quickly devote their main efforts to business work in order to quickly and thoroughly end the temporary economic stagnation. We also suggest that all regions immediately organize a large number of industrial products to go to the countryside to meet the needs of farmers after the wheat harvest.

    华北区物资交流大会工作总结
    华北区物资交流大会工作委员会
    为了在“三反”和“五反”的胜利基础上，进一步加强物资交流、活跃城乡经济，我们根据华北经济会议的决定，于四月二十三日召开了华北物资交流大会。这个大会至五月二十一日闭幕，历时二十八天。到会者有华北五省二市、内蒙及各大行政区的小型贸易代表团，共一百零九个单位，华北各省辖市和大部专区及内蒙各盟旗，都派遣了小型贸易代表团，参加大会，进行交易。由于华北行政委员会的正确领导，各省、市和各大行政区的积极支援，以及大会全体工作人员的积极工作，大会已胜利地达到了预期的目的。主要收获如下：
    （一）共签订了合同、协议二千八百零一件，组织了七千四百五十四亿三千四百万元的成交。其中合同部分占成交总金额百分之八十三点九，协议部分占百分之十六点一。成交商品以农、副、土、特产品为主，占成交总金额的百分之八十一点八，城市工业品为次，占百分之十八点二。从经济成分来看，国营经济采购部分占成交总金额的百分之七十六点五，推销部分占成交总金额的百分之三十九点三，合作社采购部分占成交总金额百分之十六点七，推销部分占百分之五十七点七，私营经济采购部分占成交总金额的百分之六点八，推销部分占成交总金额的百分之三。这种情况，表现了国营经济和合作社的带头作用。在大宗成交的土特产品中，计有：土布十六万三千八百匹，席子五十二万片，各种药材三百三十万斤，肥料一万二千吨，肥猪一十四万二千口，农具二万二千件。城市工业品大宗成交者为各色细布，共达一十三万三千匹。日用百货成交总值三百二十四亿元。
    经过上述的大量成交，华北城乡经济暂时呆滞的现象，将要大大克服。土特产大体上推销完了。积压的工业品推销了一部分。这对工农业生产的发展起了一定的推动作用。同时，通过此次大会，也建立了一些新的贸易关系。如山西省的生铁和铁货，河北省的虾皮，远销到广西省。
    （二）灾区农民要解决的供销问题，在这次大会上解决了不少，对灾区生产起了很大的扶助与指导作用。例如：河北省天津专区宝坻县和唐山专区玉田县，自去冬到今春，积压了妇女生产的鞋和鞋底约三万双，通过这次大会，全部推销出去。又如河北省保定专区白洋淀一带灾区生产的席子，过去积压现象相当严重，无法继续生产，通过这次大会，推销了二十七万五千片，换回了大批肥料，解决了该地一百三十个村子的三万六千席民的生产问题。由于大会解决了灾区人民不少的供销问题，因此，到会的灾区代表都表示满意。
    （三）清理了过去签订的合同协议，进一步树立了合同信用。据此次检查，一九五一年华北区城乡物资交流展览大会上所签订的三千六百七十二件合同和五百三十四件协议的执行情况，一般说来是好的，计合同已执行百分之八十七，协议已执行百分之四十五。撤销的合同占百分之一，协议占百分之五。这说明去年华北城乡物资交流展览大会所订合同还比较接近于产销实际情况。在未执行的合同、协议中，除尚未到期者外，其未执行的原因是：或因不了解产销情况，盲目地签订合同；或因价格变化，有关方面感到无利；或因成交的货品不合标准规格，等等；而最根本的原因，是由于有些单位不顾合同的严肃性与法律性，不遵守合同信用。为了解决上述合同、协议执行中的问题，大会专设了合同协议检查委员会，以督促执行过去签订的合同，并把过去的协议转订为合同，使之进一步肯定起来。此次提请大会解决的合同协议纠纷问题共一百三十九件，其中由大会合同协议检查委员会调解仲裁获得解决者共一百件。占总件数百分之七十一，值一千六百八十五亿余元。其中协议变合同者二十八件，值一千三百九十一亿余元。经该委员会说服，按原订条件并调整价格数量后执行者共五十三件，值二百四十七亿元。批准撤销者十九件，值四十七亿元。通过此次检查清理工作，维护了合同信用，纠正了过去盲目签订合同的毛病，使大家进一步认识到合同的严肃性与法律责任。因此，在这次大会上，各单位签订合同时就比较慎重。这对此次签订的合同、协议的执行，给了有力的保证。
    取得以上成绩的原因：
    一、执行了正确的交易方针，采取了灵活的交易方式。此次大会的交易方针是：“公私兼顾、城乡互助、有买有卖、多买多卖、买卖结合”。这一方针的贯彻，对端正交易思想、组织大量成交起了极大作用。大会交易开始时，各地贸易代表团由于只看到自己商品积压、流动资金困难等情况，因而普遍地存在着“只卖不买”或“多卖少买”的片面观点。大会及时地批判了这种思想偏向，说明这是违反交易规律的，是达不到交易目的的。并号召各个贸易代表团发扬互助互利的精神，贯彻上述交易方针。这就迅速地打开了当时互相观望的局面。同时，大会又采取了现货现款、现货期款、现款期货、赊销、委托代购代销、联购联销、旧协议变新合同和以货易货等多种多样的交易方式，使得各地贸易代表团在资金不足的情况下，仍能大量成交。对于私营企业，参加大会的国营经济各部门都贯彻了公私兼顾政策，在业务经营方式上、价格问题上、同一商品成交的分配上，都对私营企业作了必要的带动与照顾。此外，在成交手续上，力求简便，也便利了短期间组织大量交易。
    二、加强政治思想领导，发扬了各地贸易代表团的积极性和主动性。大会交易开始时，部分干部和代表表现了畏首畏尾，不敢大胆进行交易。针对这一情况，大会明确指出：“三反”是反对“三害”，特别是反对贪污。只要没有“三害”，多做买卖，就是多为人民服务，因此，束手束脚、不敢负责是不对的。经过这样批判和解释，就解除了部分干部的顾虑，使他们都能主动地进行业务。大会也对私商代表进行了政策思想教育，说明只要去掉“五毒”，在共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令范围内进行经营，他们仍有合理的利润与发展的前途，以组织他们参加大会交易。此外，大会还适当地进行了政治鼓动工作，加强了爱国主义思想教育。如结合迎接“五一”劳动节，掀起了多作交易的爱国主义竞赛运动，从而在短短三天内，即组织了二千多亿元的成交。
    三、进行了较细密的组织工作。根据实际需要，大会分设了合同协议检查委员会、土产部、百货部、畜产油料部和服务部，并且贯彻了人人有专责、事事有专人做的原则。在组织成交上，大会有计划地主动地组织各单位相互交换情况，并抓紧贸易代表团团长会议，由大会领导干部亲自掌握，随时纠正在业务中发生的障碍和偏向，使许多交易得以成交。同时，大会有重点地组织了场外座谈与各种专业会议，以配合场内成交。在合同协议检查处理方面，大会采取了四种形式：（一）组织双方协商，由大会派人参加调解，这是主要的形式；（二）组织双方自行协商，这种方法用于问题不大者；（三）组织双方协商，邀请第三者协助调解；（四）对个别抗不执行合同的单位，召开各贸易代表团会议，民主讨论解决。由于采取了这种群众路线的方式，故能于较短时间内解决了不少的合同协议执行中的纠纷。
    四、经过“三反”“五反”运动的教育改造，加以大会反复强调必须遵守合同信用。各单位已开始树立了新的交易态度。在进行交易时，一般地比较老实负责，逐渐做到言而有信，货真价实，并慎重地签订合同。国营贸易和合作社互相信任，互相依靠，在业务上的结合更密切了。如国营贸易在此次大会上与合作社共订立了代购合同二十四件，总值二千七百零一亿元，对扶助合作社和保证国家收购、出口任务，起了很大作用。
    根据此次大会的体验，对今后组织物资交流的工作，提出几项建议：
    1、各有关部门和单位应该随时随地了解各地产销情况，订立生产、销售计划，这是有计划地开展贸易工作的主要一环。只有了解了产销情况，才能使签订的合同协议不致落空，才能心中有数地去进行交易。有的单位在这次大会中因对产销情况不够了解，因而就不能很好地与人成交。
    2、为巩固物资交流大会的成果，希望各区、省、市、专区、县在当地财政经济委员会领导下，建立检查合同、协议的机构，以便及时检查和监督合同、协议的执行。所有的合同在原则上都不许撕毁，遇有擅自撕毁者，应酌情给以赔偿、处罚或判刑等处分。
    3、这种会议是物资流转的新形式，它对推动土产出口或内销，都能起很大的作用。我们建议各地有计划地定期召开这种会议。各省、市、专区、县亦可以地区为单位，多召开小型的物资交流会，以便增强各地短距离的群众性的物资交流。
    4、目前广大农村迫切需要农具、农药等生产资料。我们建议各大城市有计划地发展农药、农具生产。中小城市应该有计划地设立小型农具工厂，以适应农业生产的需要。
    5、我们建议各有关部门迅速拿出主要力量从事业务工作，以便迅速彻底结束暂时的经济呆滞现象。我们并建议各地立即组织大批工业品下乡，以适应麦收后农民的需要。
