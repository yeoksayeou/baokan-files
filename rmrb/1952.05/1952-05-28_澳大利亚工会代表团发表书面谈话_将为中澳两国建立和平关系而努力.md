Xinhua News Agency, May 27th:

    The Australian trade union delegation, which came to our country to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of its departure from China:

    Our visit to People's China is drawing towards its end. The Australian trade union delegation will soon return to Australia to report in detail to our trade unions and the Australian people our experiences and the results of our sightseeing here. We believe that our visit at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has been extremely successful. We have travelled to many places (these travels were arranged in consultation with and with the agreement of all the delegates), including large cities, provincial capitals and rural areas, which gave us a very pleasant opportunity to observe various important fundamental aspects of the new China.

    Everywhere in China one can see the enthusiasm and happiness of the people; everywhere one can see the people wholeheartedly supporting the social system they are building under their own new national institutions, a national institution that is truly based on the people, truly expresses their aspirations, and is thoroughly democratic. We have confirmed that, although it has been less than three years since the Chinese people achieved victory after experiencing many difficult years full of war and destruction, production has generally recovered and is now advancing at a rapid pace towards industrialization and economic development.

    In the many workplaces we visited, we were deeply impressed by the high level of self-awareness shown by the workers regarding their leading role. Everywhere, the workers' enthusiasm for labor has greatly increased productivity, far exceeding the period before liberation. This is also reflected in the increasing strength and organization of the trade unions, and their right to participate in enterprise management. The initiative and creativity of the workers have been brought into play. They have put forward rationalization measures and innovative suggestions, which have greatly accelerated economic development.

    In a factory in Shenyang, we had the opportunity to visit the demonstration of high-speed steel cutting by the famous Soviet high-speed metal cutting worker, Busuyev. We saw a large number of machine workers watching the demonstration very attentively, eagerly wanting to learn his methods and try to apply them to their own work.

    In the countryside, we also saw the high enthusiasm of the peasants aroused by the land reform. The lives of the peasants are clearly changing, they are finding happiness under the new regime, and are beginning to play their role in the new economic and social development. The peasants are no longer plagued by hunger, and they are moving towards a prosperous life.

    We saw another manifestation of the peasants' enthusiasm when we visited the great Huai River project. This great project of flood storage, irrigation, flood control and transportation is a remarkable achievement that could only be achieved under the new democratic regime.

    We know that in the old China, the social status of women was very low. But now in the new society, the situation where they actively participate in political, social and economic life together with men has made a strong impression on us. Today, Chinese women have equal status with men and receive the same pay as men. The regulations for paid maternity leave, the establishment of nurseries and other measures guarantee their rights. In towns and villages, we witnessed many examples illustrating the concern for children's welfare. This is a characteristic of People's China. The children's plump faces and happy lives deeply moved us.

    In studying the wage issue, we found that in the short period since the establishment of the people's regime, wages have increased considerably. The stability of prices and the point system for calculating wages based on purchasing power have ensured the livelihood of workers, which is not available in the capitalist world. Working hours have been shortened, work to improve housing conditions is being vigorously promoted, and labor insurance has greatly contributed to improving living standards.

    There has also been tremendous development in culture in People's China. Educational work is expanding rapidly. Great achievements have been made in eliminating illiteracy. We visited several workers' cultural palaces, where study classes, exhibitions, choirs and drama groups, literacy classes, libraries, reading rooms and other activities attract a large number of workers to participate in cultural life.

    In the life of the new China, Chinese youth are particularly enthusiastic and energetic. We saw this in Beijing on Youth Day - May 4th. At the same time, this characteristic was also clearly visible in other places we visited.

    The Chinese people's spirit of internationalism and their longing for world peace and international friendship are very strong. The powerful demonstrations we saw in Beijing on International Labor Day - May 1st, convincingly demonstrated this. Moreover, in the various places we visited, this situation was also manifested in the spontaneous and warm welcome we received as foreign delegations. We were welcomed by many masses, who expressed their friendship to the people we represent.

    In Beijing, we visited the exhibition of evidence of the bacteriological warfare crimes committed by the United States in Korea and China, and we examined it very carefully. The evidence makes us absolutely convinced that the United States has indeed committed the heinous crime of waging bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. Our delegation condemns this inhuman method of warfare and will do its utmost to awaken our people to oppose the criminals who are waging this war.

    In China, we see a society where state power is firmly in the hands of the people. There, the leaders of the government, starting with Chairman Mao Zedong, are wholeheartedly loved by the people. Its economy, on the one hand, allows capitalist enterprises to have their freedom within the framework of the Common Program unanimously adopted by all parties and people's organizations; on the other hand, it is developing socialist state-owned and cooperative enterprises, the speed of whose development ensures that the latter increasingly occupy a leading position and guarantee the victory of socialism.

    We see that the central purpose of the People's Government is peace and maintaining friendly relations with all countries. The work of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, headed by the famous peace activist Guo Moruo, is supported by the people. We will report these facts to the Australian people.

    We will recommend to Australian trade unions that they establish close ties with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and regularly exchange delegations.

    We will work to establish peaceful relations between our two countries.

### 澳大利亚工会代表团发表书面谈话  将为中澳两国建立和平关系而努力

    澳大利亚工会代表团发表书面谈话
    将为中澳两国建立和平关系而努力
    【新华社二十七日讯】来我国参加“五一”节观礼的澳大利亚工会代表团，在离开中国前夕，发表书面谈话如下：
    我们在人民中国的访问即将告一结束，澳大利亚工会代表团不久将回到澳大利亚，向我们的工会和澳大利亚人民详尽地报告我们在这里的体验以及我们观光的结果。我们认为，我们这次应中华全国总工会的邀请而作的访问极为成功。我们曾到很多地方去旅行（这些旅行是在与各代表协商并取得一致意见后安排的），其中有大都市、省会与乡村，这使我们得到一次非常愉快的机会来观察新中国的各个重要基本方面。
    在中国，到处都看得见人民的热情与幸福；到处都可以看到人民衷心拥护他们自己在新的国家机构之下所正在建设的社会制度，这个国家机构是真正以人民为基础的，真正表达了他们的愿望，而且是彻底民主的。我们证实了，虽然中国人民在经历了许多充满着战争与破坏的艰苦年月之后取得胜利还不满三年，生产方面整个来说是已经恢复了，现在正跨着迅速的步伐向工业化与发展经济的道路前进。
    在我们访问过的许多工作地点，工人对自己的领导作用所表现出来的高度自觉，给了我们深刻的印象。随便那一处，工人的劳动热情都使生产率大大提高，远超过解放前的时期。这也反映在工会的力量与组织性不断提高，以及他们参加企业管理的权利上。工人的积极性与创造力被发挥出来了。他们提出了合理化措施与革新建议，使经济发展大为加速。
    在沈阳一个工厂里，我们得到机会参观苏联著名的高速金属切削工人布苏也夫表演高速切钢。我们看见大批的机器工人非常注意地在看表演，热切地要学习他的方法，并尽量把它应用到自己的工作上去。
    在农村，我们也看到土地改革唤起了农民的高度热情。农民的生活显而易见地正在改变着，他们在新的政权下得到了幸福，并且开始在新的经济与社会发展中发挥他们的作用。农民不再为饥饿所困，他们在向着繁荣的生活前进。
    我们在参观伟大的淮河工程时看到了农民的热情的又一表现。这个蓄洪、灌溉、防洪与运输的大工程是一个卓越的成绩，只有在新民主主义的政权下才能取得这样的成绩。
    我们知道，在旧中国，妇女的社会地位是很低的。但是现在新的社会里，她们与男子一道积极参加政治、社会与经济各方面生活的情形，给了我们一个强烈的印象。今天，中国妇女与男子有平等的地位，得到和男子同样的报酬。妇女产期照付工资的规定、托儿所的设立及其他等等措施，保障了她们的权利。在城镇和乡村里，我们目睹许多的实例说明对儿童福利的关怀。这是人民中国的一个特色。儿童们丰润的面孔和幸福的生活使我们深受感动。
    在研究工资问题的时候，我们发现在人民政权建立后的短短期间，工资已增加不少，物价的稳定和根据购买力计算工资的计分制，使工人生活有了保障，这是资本主义世界所没有的。工作时间缩短了，改善居住条件的工作在大力举办，劳动保险使生活水准更得到巨大的助益。
    人民中国的文化也有巨大的发展。教育工作正在迅速扩大。扫除文盲的工作有很大的成绩。我们参观了几处工人文化宫，那里的学习班、展览会、合唱团和剧团、识字班、图书馆、阅览室和其他的活动吸引了大量工人参加文化生活。
    在新中国的生活中，中国青年是特别热情而朝气勃勃的。青年节——五月四日，我们在北京看到这种情形。同时，在我们去过的其他地点，这种特色也都显然可见。
    中国人民的国际主义精神，对世界和平与国际友谊的向往是非常强烈的。国际劳动节——五月一日，我们在北京看见的强大的示威游行，令人深信不疑地表现了这一点。而且在我们参观过的各地，这种情形在我们这些外国来的代表团所受到的自然而然的热烈欢迎上也表现出来了。我们受到许多群众的欢迎，他们对我们所代表的人民表示了他们的友情。
    在北京，我们参观了美国在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战罪证展览会，并曾加以非常仔细的考查。这些罪证使我们绝对地相信美国确是犯了对朝鲜人民和中国人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行。我们代表团谴责这种非人道的战争手段，并将尽其全力唤起我国人民来反对进行这种战争的罪犯。
    在中国，我们看到这样一个社会，在那里，国家权力是稳固地掌握在人民手里的。在那里，政府的领袖，从毛泽东主席起，莫不受到人民衷心的爱戴。它的经济，一方面准许资本主义的企业在各党派与人民团体所一致通过的共同纲领的范围内有它的自由；另一方面在发展着社会主义的国营与合作企业，其发展的速度使这后一种企业日益居于领导地位，并保证社会主义的胜利。
    我们看到，人民政府的中心目的就是和平及和各国人民保持友好关系。以著名的和平工作者郭沫若为首的中国人民保卫世界和平委员会所作的工作是得到人民的支持的。我们将要把这些事实报告给澳大利亚人民。
    我们将向澳大利亚各工会建议与中华全国总工会建立密切的联系，并经常地互派代表。
    我们将为我们两国建立和平关系而努力。
