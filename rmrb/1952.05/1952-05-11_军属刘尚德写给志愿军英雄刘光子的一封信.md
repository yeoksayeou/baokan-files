    A Letter from Military Family Member Liu Shangde to Volunteer Army Hero Liu Guangzi

    Glorious and beloved Guangzi, my son:

    The good news has reached home that you captured sixty-three enemy soldiers on the Korean battlefield, became a combat hero and a first-class meritorious worker, and were awarded the First-Class Military Service Medal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Our whole family was overjoyed. Not just our family, but everyone in the village, the county, and the entire special district are happy for you. On April 23rd this year, the Shaanba Special District's Resist America, Aid Korea branch held a celebration meeting for you. The day before, they sent a horse-drawn carriage to pick up our entire family to Shaanba Town. In the town, we were surrounded by the Young Pioneers, the waist drum team, and welcoming crowds. Everyone was as affectionate as they would be with their own parents. They held my hand, hugged my waist, and pinned glory flowers on us. At that moment, your father was so happy that he shed tears.

    The meeting was held in the Northeast Bridge Square in Shaanba. The venue was decorated with colorful sheds, and a total of 20,000 people attended. Representatives from the Suiyuan Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Government, and the Provincial Military Region were all present. The leaders of the special district were also there, along with representatives of the Volunteer Army returning from Korea and representatives of the Korean people visiting China. There were also representatives from Micang, Langshan, and Linhe counties, as well as representatives of martyrs' families, military families, organizations, groups, troops, and people from all walks of life. Everyone congratulated us upon meeting. Guangzi, I have never enjoyed such great glory in my life!

    Shen Xinfa, Chairman of the Shaanba Special District Resist America, Aid Korea branch, and Li Bingsan, Commissioner, both gave speeches. Comrade Tian Yu, a representative of the Volunteer Army returning from Korea, reported on your heroic deeds. Many other people also spoke. They all said they would learn from you and mobilize to carry out the patriotic production increase movement to support the Volunteer Army. An elementary school student said, "I must learn from Uncle Liu Guangzi's spirit, study hard, exercise, and become a hero who defends the motherland in the future." Everyone welcomed my wife and me to speak. We were covered in glory flowers. Various organizations, groups, and villagers gave us a portrait of Chairman Mao, framed in an exquisite glass frame; a large red wooden plaque engraved with the four golden characters "Patriotic Meritorious Worker"; many silk banners; and plows, rakes, hoes, shovels, and other comfort items, filling a whole cart.

    After the meeting, my younger brother Guangqian, your younger sister Jinjin, your wife, and I rode horses, wearing red flowers, parading on the streets. The streets were filled with crowds welcoming us. At that moment, I thought, "If I were twenty years younger, I would also ride a horse to Korea to kill American devils and eliminate harm for the people, which would be even more glorious!"

    The next day, Chairman Shen Xinfa, Commissioner Li Bingsan, and others personally escorted us home. When we arrived at the village, the village was celebrating with decorations. More than 5,000 representatives from the county and nearby villagers lined up to welcome us. They said, "One person's meritorious service brings glory to the whole village." "One person's meritorious service brings glory to the whole county." After the village held a celebration meeting, the villagers held a symposium. They said, "We will use patriotic production increase to celebrate Liu Guangzi's meritorious service." On the spot, eight mutual aid teams launched a bumper harvest competition challenge to the whole county. Seven families who had not signed patriotic pacts in the past now want to sign patriotic pacts. Everyone promises to produce more grain, do a good job in supporting military families, and strive to become a model village for supporting military families. Representatives of military families from the whole county also agreed to join mutual aid teams and strive to produce one extra dou of grain per mu. They will never rely on the government for problems that can be solved by themselves. Everyone also decided to jointly write a letter to comfort you.

    Guangzi, don't worry about our family at all. During the land reform, we were allocated 51.8 mu of top-quality land, five cows, and several sheep. The government and the villagers take care of us more thoughtfully than our own relatives. Our family has also participated in the patriotic production increase and conservation movement. We will practice thrift, plow deeply and cultivate carefully, diligently repair ponds and dams, and prevent pests to ensure that the 28 mu of wheat we planted ourselves will yield more than 400 jin per mu; the three mu of high-yield land will reach the highest yield in the whole village. We will use practical actions to repay Chairman Mao and the villagers for their concern for us.

    Guangzi, work even harder to kill the enemy and strive for more meritorious service!

    Please represent our whole family in extending our highest respects to Commander Peng Dehuai, General Kim Il-sung, all the Volunteer Army comrades, and the Korean People's Army comrades.

    Your father, Liu Shangde
    April 24th, in Jianzidi Village, Micang County, Suiyuan Province

    军属刘尚德写给志愿军英雄刘光子的一封信
    光荣的、亲爱的光子儿：
    你在朝鲜战场上活捉六十三个鬼子兵，当了战斗英雄和一等功臣，又得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一等军功章。这个喜讯传到家里，咱全家老小乐得不知怎样才好。不光咱一家，全村、全县、全专区的人都为你高兴。今年四月二十三日，陕坝专区抗美援朝分会为你开了庆功大会。头一天，他们派马车把咱全家人接到陕坝镇。在镇上，咱们被少年儿童队、腰鼓队和欢迎的人围住了。一个个都像对自己的爸爸、妈妈那样亲热。他们拉着我的手，抱着我的腰，给我们挂上光荣花。这时，爸爸乐得流出眼泪来了。
    大会是在陕坝东北大桥广场开的。会场高搭彩棚，到会的一共有两万人。绥远省委、省人民政府、省军区，都派代表来了。专区的首长也来了。还有志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民访华代表。还有米仓、狼山、临河各县的代表，有烈属军属、机关、团体、部队和各界人民的代表。大伙见面就向咱道贺。光子，咱一生那儿享受过这样大的光荣呀！
    专区抗美援朝分会沈新发主席、李秉三专员，都讲了话。志愿军归国代表田雨同志报告了你的英勇事迹。还有许多人讲话。他们都说要向你学习，要一致动员起来开展爱国增产运动，支援志愿军。一个小学生说：“我一定要学习刘光子叔叔的精神，努力学习，锻炼身体，将来做一个保卫祖国的英雄。”大伙又欢迎我和你的妻子讲了话。我们身上挂满了光荣花。各机关、团体、老乡们，送给咱一幅毛主席像，装着精致的玻璃框；还有刻着“爱国功臣”四个金字的大红木匾；还有许多锦旗；还有犁、耙、锄、锹和别的慰劳品，满满拉了一车。
    大会后，我和你弟弟光前、你妹妹金金和你的妻子，骑着马、戴着红花，在大街上游行。满街人山人海欢迎我们。这时，我想：“要是我小二十岁的话，也要骑着马上朝鲜杀美国鬼子，给人民除害，才更光荣哩！”
    第二天，沈新发主席、李秉三专员等亲自送我们回家。到村时，村里又在扎彩庆祝了。全县代表和附近的老乡，五千多人排着队欢迎我们。他们说：“一人立功，全村光荣。”“一人立功，全县光荣。”村里开了庆祝会以后，老乡们又开了座谈会。他们说：“要用爱国增产来给刘光子庆功。”当场就有八个互助组向全县发起丰产竞赛挑战。还有七家过去没订爱国公约的，现在也要订爱国公约。大伙保证要多打粮食，并做好优属工作，争取成为优属模范村。全县的军属代表也商量好了，都要参加互助组，每亩地争取多打一斗粮食。能自己解决的困难，决不依赖政府。大伙还决定联名写信慰问你哩。
    光子，咱家你一点也不要牵挂。土地改革时，咱分了五十一亩八分上等地、五条牛、好几只羊。政府和老乡照顾咱比亲人还周到。咱家也参加了爱国增产节约运动，要厉行节约、深耕细作、勤修塘坝、防止虫害，保证自己种的二十八亩小麦每亩打四百斤以上；三亩丰产地，要达到全村的最高产量。咱要用实际行动来报答毛主席，报答老乡们对咱的关怀。
    光子，要更加努力杀敌，争取功上加功！
    请你代表咱全家，向彭德怀司令员，向金日成将军，向全体志愿军同志和朝鲜人民军同志，致崇高的敬礼。
    你的爸爸刘尚德
    四月二十四日于绥远省米仓县尖子地村
