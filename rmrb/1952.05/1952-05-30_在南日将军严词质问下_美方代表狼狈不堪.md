　　[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 29th] Special correspondent for this agency reports: The U.S. chief representative, Harrison, became even more flustered and incoherent on the 28th, going so far as to claim that the official U.S. news about the U.S. side massacring our captured personnel on Geoje Island and Busan was "obviously a deception." General Nam Il posed a series of questions to Harrison, demanding that he give a responsible account of the U.S. side repeatedly killing and wounding our captured personnel. Harrison used the excuse that those questions were "deceptive" and refused to answer them.

　　But everyone knows that the U.S. side's massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island on February 18th and March 13th was announced by the "United Nations Command," the killing and wounding of our captured personnel in Busan on May 20th was announced by Van Fleet's Eighth Army, and the Geoje Island massacre on April 10th was announced by the Associated Press, Reuters, and other American news agencies.

　　Harrison initially pretended to be nonchalant, whistling at the conference table, but when General Nam Il posed a series of questions to him, asking about the U.S. side killing and wounding our captured personnel under the guise of so-called "fair screening," his nonchalant demeanor suddenly disappeared. General Nam Il questioned, "Why can't your side give any account of the countless massacres that have occurred in your prisoner-of-war camps? I demand that you answer this question." Harrison had to resort to his usual trick: "I suggest a recess."

　　General Nam Il pointed out, "It seems that you cannot answer. I will ask you again. Do you think that after your side openly carries out massacres of our captured personnel without giving a responsible account, your side can now openly gather a large number of troops, even assemble flamethrower tanks, and prepare to continue large-scale massacres?" Harrison was speechless for five minutes. Later, he had no choice but to say unreasonably, "I am unwilling to discuss these issues now or in the future. The facts related to this outside the tent have already been stated. I suggest a recess."

　　General Nam Il sternly reminded him, "All issues concerning the lives, deaths, and safety of our captured personnel are directly related to this meeting." He also reminded Harrison, "We are holding the meeting inside the tent, not outside. Therefore, you must answer our questions inside the tent, not outside."

　　That Harrison, who wanted General Nam Il to believe that 100,000 of our captured personnel would rather "commit suicide" than return home, was guiltily silent in the face of the series of questions posed by General Nam Il: Why was the bloodshed on April 10th concealed for as long as forty-four days? What reason is there to force them to accept so-called screening by cutting off the prisoners' food? What reason is there to refuse to answer protests and questions about the lives and safety of prisoners of war?

　　Since Harrison was unable to answer these questions, General Nam Il suggested a recess until the usual meeting time tomorrow, so that Harrison would "have time to consider these questions." Harrison immediately said, "I agree." He was so flustered and busy leaving the tent that General Nam Il's interpreter had not finished translating when he had already stood up. Harrison's predecessor, Joy, had also been in a similar hurry to leave the meeting in the face of the facts presented by General Nam Il. General Nam Il reminded him of this, and he had to sit down again until his interpreter had finished translating.

### 在南日将军严词质问下  美方代表狼狈不堪

    在南日将军严词质问下
    美方代表狼狈不堪
    【新华社开城二十九日电】本社特派记者报道：美方首席代表哈利逊二十八日更加慌乱而且语无伦次地进行抵赖，竟然把美方自己发表的关于美方在巨济岛和釜山屠杀我方被俘人员的官方消息说成“显然是欺骗”。南日将军向哈利逊提出一连串质问，要他对美方一再杀伤我方被俘人员的事件作负责交代。哈利逊藉口那些质问是“欺骗”，不肯答复这些质问。
    但是尽人皆知，二月十八日和三月十三日美方在巨济岛上屠杀我方被俘人员事件是“联合国军”司令部发表的，五月二十日在釜山杀伤我方被俘人员的事件是范佛里特的第八军发表的，四月十日的巨济岛屠杀事件是美联社、路透社以及其他美国通讯社发表的。
    哈利逊起先装做漫不经心的样子，在会议桌旁吹口哨，可是当南日将军向他提出一连串质问，问到美方在他所谓“公平甄别”的幌子下杀伤我方被俘人员的情况时，他那种漫不经心的样子突然不见了。南日将军质问道：“为什么你方对你方战俘营内发生的无数次屠杀连一次也不能交代？我要求你答复这个问题。”哈利逊只好耍弄惯用的手段：“我建议休会”。
    南日将军指出：“看来，你无法答复。我要再问你。你以为你们对我方被俘人员公然进行屠杀，而又没有作负责的交代，你方现在就可以公然集合大批军队，甚至聚集喷火坦克，准备继续进行大规模屠杀吗？”哈利逊哑口无言达五分钟之久。后来他只好蛮横无理地说：“我在现在和今后都不愿讨论这些问题。在这个帐篷外面有关的事实已经讲过了。我建议休会。”
    南日将军义正辞严地提醒他：“一切有关我方被俘人员的生死和安全的问题，都与这次会议有直接关系。”他并且提醒哈利逊说：“我们是在帐篷里面而不是在外面举行会议。因此你必须在帐篷里面而不是在外面回答我们的问题。”
    那个想要南日将军相信十万我方被俘人员宁愿“自杀”也不肯回家的哈利逊，在南日将军提出的一连串质问面前，自觉有罪地不发一语：为什么隐瞒四月十日的流血事件达四十四天之久？有什么理由用断绝战俘伙食的手段来强迫他们接受所谓甄别？有什么理由拒绝答复关于战俘的生命和安全的抗议及质问？
    由于哈利逊无法答复这些质问，南日将军建议休会到明天通常开会的时间，使哈利逊“有时间考虑这些质问”。哈利逊马上说：“我同意。”他那样狼狈不堪地忙于离开帐篷，以致南日将军的通译员还没有翻译完毕，他就已经站起来了。哈利逊的前任乔埃在南日将军提出的事实面前，也曾经同样地急于退席。南日将军提醒他注意这一点，他不得不再度落座，一直等到他的通译员翻译完毕时为止。
