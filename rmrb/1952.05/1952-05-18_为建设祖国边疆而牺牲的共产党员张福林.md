On the Kangzang Plateau, what is most moving and unforgettable is the sight of the soldiers battling against dangerous mountains and rivers to open up the Kangzang Highway. These heroes, who in the past fought north and south to liberate the vast lands of our great motherland, are now, in order to bring prosperity and happiness to the Tibetan people of the southwestern frontier, putting forward the slogan of "carrying the highway forward." Regardless of the heavy mountains and the blockade of ice and snow, they are determined to open up a wide road on the "roof of the world."

Last December, during the bitter cold winter, the troops entering Tibet were working day and night in the wind and snow to repair the highway on Mount Que'er, which is 5,300 meters above sea level. Unable to stand on the steep cliffs, they hammered steel spikes into the cliffs, tied ropes, and secured their waists, chiseling rocks in mid-air. The soldiers' selfless work spirit overcame all kinds of difficulties, and they finally built a brand-new highway on Mount Que'er.

During the most intense period of repairing the Que'er Mountain Highway, Communist Party member Zhang Fulin wrote an immortal epic with his own blood.

Communist Party member Zhang Fulin was originally a machine gun shooter who could hit the target 100% of the time within 500 meters. He had participated in more than a dozen major and minor battles in Taiyuan, Qinling, Chengdu, and other places. After the troops received the task of entering Tibet, he was promoted to the leader of a small artillery squad. This time, his small artillery squad was responsible for the blasting task to repair the Que'er Mountain Highway. Although they were engaged in fierce "artillery battles" with Que'er Mountain day and night, one shell could only blast away less than two cubic feet of stone. At this rate, when would they be able to blast a road out of a mountain? At that time, the entire army was studying ways to improve the technology of amplifying artillery. Zhang Fulin was particularly active. He studied day and night with engineers and comrades, and finally developed a method of improving the charging method and using rock crevices for artillery firing. His first shell was charged with 70 kilograms of explosives, blasting away 570 cubic feet of stone; the second shell was charged with 40 kilograms of explosives, blasting away more than 470 cubic feet. His experience in "amplifying artillery" was quickly promoted in the army.

During the road construction, Zhang Fulin had contracted malaria. The soldiers advised him to rest, but he said: "What does it matter if I personally have a few bouts of malaria! One kilogram of explosives costs 200,000 yuan. If we fire a 'sky cannon' once, the country will suffer a great loss." At noon on December 10th last year, the troops had stopped work and were preparing to gather for a meal. Zhang Fulin led his small artillery squad and was busy loading explosives for blasting. He checked whether each blasting hole was deep enough; and also held the detonator on the fuse with both hands. At this moment, a two-cubic-foot stone suddenly fell and hit Zhang Fulin, causing very serious injuries. He immediately fainted. When he woke up, he did not groan or shed tears. He said sadly to the instructor: "Instructor! I understand in my heart that I cannot live! Now I have 45,000 yuan in my pocket, which will be my last party membership fee. Also, please tell the party at the higher level that I can no longer serve the people!" His last two sentences were very low and hoarse. At this time, he saw that the comrades around him were shedding tears and feeling sorry for him. He cheered up and said: "Don't look at me, hurry up and go to work! Learn from my lessons in the future and pay attention to the safety of personnel." An hour later, Zhang Fulin finally sacrificed himself.

Zhang Fulin's last words moved his comrades around him to tears, and his words also deeply educated his comrades. The Communist Party branch of his company immediately held a branch meeting, and all party members mourned the sacrifice of Zhang Fulin with deep sorrow, and expressed their determination to learn from the spirit of Zhang Fulin and complete the task of repairing the Que'er Mountain Highway ahead of schedule. The comrades in his small artillery squad, after grief, made a common resolution plan: "In memory of our squad leader Zhang, we will never slacken our efforts. We will continue to study, improve work efficiency, and resolutely complete the road construction task."

Now, the highway on Mount Que'er has been completed, and people can sit in cars and easily and quickly cross the mountain peaks. But in the valley under Mount Que'er, lies buried the body of Zhang Fulin, an outstanding Communist Party member and a heroic soldier of the people. People who drive through here, whether Han or Tibetan, are deeply grateful to the great warrior who sacrificed himself for the construction of the motherland's frontier.

    为建设祖国边疆而牺牲的共产党员张福林
    新华社记者　赵慎应
    在康藏高原上，最使人感动和难忘的，是战士们为开辟康藏公路与险山恶水搏斗的情景。这些过去为了解放伟大祖国广大土地而南征北战的英雄们，今天为了给西南边疆的藏族人民带来繁荣和幸福，他们提出了“背着公路前进”的口号。不顾险山重重和冰雪的封锁，他们决心要在“世界屋脊”上，开辟出一条宽阔的道路来。
    去年十二月，正是严寒的冬天，进藏部队在拔海五千三百公尺的雀儿山上，夜以继日地冒着风雪，抢修公路。在陡峭的石崖上站不住脚，他们就在石崖上打下钢签，拴上绳子，把腰拦住，在半空中开山凿石。战士们忘我的工作精神，克服了各种困难，终于在雀儿山上，修出了一条崭新的公路。
    在抢修雀儿山公路最紧张的时候，共产党员张福林以自己的鲜血，写下了永垂不朽的史诗。
    共产党员张福林，原是一个在五百公尺内百发百中的机枪射手，他曾参加过太原、秦岭、成都等地大小战役十多次。在部队接受进藏任务后，他升任了小炮班长。这次抢修雀儿山公路，他的小炮班担任了爆炸任务。他们虽然不分昼夜地和雀儿山进行着激烈的“炮战”，但是，一炮只能炸掉不到两立方尺的石头。照这样什么时候才能把一个山炸出一条路来呢？当时整个部队都在研究改进放大炮的技术，张福林表现特别积极，他日夜向工程师和战友们学习，终于研究出改善装药方法和利用石缝放炮的办法。他第一炮装药七十公斤，炸掉了五百七十立方尺石头；第二炮装药四十公斤，炸掉了四百七十多立方尺。他“放大炮”的经验，很快地在部队中推广开来。
    在修路中，张福林曾经得过疟疾病，战士们劝他休息，他说：“我个人发几场疟疾算啥！一斤炸药要二十万块钱，如果放一次冲天炮，国家受的损失可就大了。”去年十二月十日中午，部队已歇工准备集合吃饭。张福林率领着他的小炮班正在忙着装药进行爆炸，他一面检查每个炮眼是否够深；一面又双手接着导火索上的雷管。这时，一块两立方尺的石头，突然坠下，打在张福林身上，伤势非常严重，他立刻昏了过去。醒来的时候，他没有呻吟，也没有流泪。他难过地对指导员说：“指导员！我心里明白，我是不能活啦！现在我口袋里还有四万五千块钱，作为我最后的一次党费。另外请你告诉上级党，说我再不能为人民服务啦！”他最后的两句话，声音很低很哑。这时他看见周围的同志们都在流泪为他痛惜，他振起精神说：“你们不要看我啦，赶快上工去吧！以后接受我的教训，注意人员安全。”一个钟头后，张福林终于牺牲了。
    张福林临死时的话，感动得围着他的战友们痛哭失声，他的话也深深地教育了他的战友。他连里的共产党支部，立即召开了一次支部大会，全体党员沉痛哀悼张福林的牺牲，并表示决心学习张福林的精神，把抢修雀儿山公路的任务提前完成。他的小炮班的战友们，在悲恸之后，订出共同的决心计划：“为纪念我们的张班长，我们决不松劲。我们继续学习，提高工效，坚决完成修路任务。”
    现在，雀儿山上的公路已经修通了，人们可以坐着汽车，毫不费力地迅速地越过山峰。但雀儿山下的山谷里，却葬埋着优秀的共产党员、人民的英勇战士张福林的尸体。坐着汽车从这里走过的人们，不论是汉人、藏人，都深深地感激着为建设祖国边疆而牺牲的伟大战士。
