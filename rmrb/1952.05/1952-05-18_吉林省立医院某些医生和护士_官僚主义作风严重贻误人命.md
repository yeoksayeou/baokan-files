    Certain Doctors and Nurses at Jilin Provincial Hospital
    Bureaucratic Work Style Seriously Endangers Lives
    Editor: I am now informing you of the bureaucratic work style of certain doctors and nurses at Jilin Provincial Hospital, and I request that you publish it publicly. At 7:00 PM on March 19th, my child suddenly vomited. By 3:00 AM the next morning, his breathing was very rapid, and the school doctor injected him with a shot of penicillin. At that time, the child showed convulsions, his eyes rolled back, and his body temperature was as high as 40.5 degrees Celsius. At 8:30 AM, I took him to Jilin Provincial Hospital. Doctor Chang Mingde injected him with a shot of cardiac stimulant and told me to take him to the emergency room to wait for treatment. When I took my child to the emergency room, his fingers and lips were turning purple, but for a very long time, no doctor or nurse came to see him. After repeated requests, a nurse in the emergency room glanced at him and walked away. At that time, the child's breathing was already weak. I took care of the child and repeatedly requested a doctor. From 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, I requested a doctor eight or nine times, but the doctor always made excuses and refused to see him. Finally, a doctor came. He took a look and said that the child's life had no hope. Later, in the morgue, the doctor injected the child with another cardiac stimulant, but the child still died.
    This incident shows that certain doctors and nurses at Jilin Provincial Hospital have a serious bureaucratic work style. From 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM was not a short time, but the doctor repeatedly delayed seeing the patient, causing the child's death. They must make a profound self-criticism of this matter.

    吉林省立医院某些医生和护士
    官僚主义作风严重贻误人命
    编辑同志：现在我把吉林省立医院某些医生和护士的官僚主义作风告诉你们，请你们公开发表。三月十九日下午七时，我的孩子突然呕吐。到了第二天早晨三时，他的呼吸很急促，我校校医就给他注射了一针盘尼西林；那时孩子表现痉挛，眼睛翻白，体温高达四十度半。八时半，我把他送往吉林省立医院。医生常铭德给他注射了一针强心剂，并叫我把他抱到急诊室候诊。我抱孩子到了急诊室时，孩子的手指嘴唇都发紫了，但是很久很久都没有医生和护士来看。经再三请求后，急诊室里的一个护士略看了一看就走开了。那时孩子呼吸已经微弱，我一面照顾孩子，又一面延请医生，从上午八时到十时，共延请了八九次，但医生总是借故拖延，不肯来看。最后有一个医生来了，他看了一看就说孩子的生命没有希望了。后来到了死亡室，医生又给孩子注射了强心剂，但孩子还是绝了气。
    这一事件，说明吉林省立医院的某些医生和护士是有着严重的官僚主义作风的。从八时到十时，为时不算短，但医生一再拖延不看病，致使孩子身死。对这一件事他们必须作深刻的检讨。
