Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 11th. Newspapers such as "Democratic Korea" and "Nodong Sinmun" prominently published the full text of the statement by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the U.S. announcement of the entry into force of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan on the 10th.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 14th. The "Liberty" newspaper, published in Calcutta, India, published an editorial on May 10th titled "Absolutely Intolerable," condemning the re-militarization of Japan under the protection of U.S. imperialism and supporting the statement by Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China. The editorial pointed out the dangers posed by the imperialist conspiracy to the Asian people, saying: "This danger is the rearming of Japan under U.S. protection. The recent treaty is just a separate 'peace' treaty forced to be signed by the United States to accelerate its war preparations.

"In fact, even before the signing of this treaty, bloodshed and tragedy had already appeared not only in one corner of Asia but in almost every part of Asia. The freedom and sovereignty of the Asian peoples continue to be subjected to violent interference. The germ warfare in Korea is conclusive proof of this violent act.

"This phenomenon is not limited to Korea. News of atrocities has also come from Malaya. Churchill's lackey government, following in the footsteps of the American war criminal ringleaders, is spreading poison in the golden rice paddies of the Malayan liberated areas. Savage British executioners are beheading captured Liberation Army soldiers for pleasure. India can no longer remain silent about this dance of death that extends from Korea to Malaya. Because this is a danger to all of us and requires a joint resistance."

The newspaper also pointed out the strength of the great Asian people, saying: "Faced with the looting, destruction, and germ warfare frenzy of the bandits, the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, the Philippines, and Indonesia have victoriously built a Great Wall of resistance. Having suffered one blow after another, the imperialists have adopted extremely barbaric means. But its own fragility makes it struggle more desperately, regardless of everything; it is impatiently trying to rekindle the ashes and ignite new flames of war throughout Asia and the world. The great strength of free and great China stands on the side of the Asian people's struggle for liberation. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is also a guarantee of peace and security in Asia."

The editorial concluded: "Each time, the imperialist acts of robbery and mad atrocities are severely hit in various parts of Asia. The people of India express their complete agreement with the statement of Mr. Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of China: This mad behavior and the conspiracy to launch a new war on the Asian continent are absolutely intolerable."

Furthermore, many newspapers throughout India and Pakistan have published summaries of the statement made by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on May 5 regarding the Japanese peace treaty issue.

    朝鲜印度巴基斯坦报纸
    显著刊载周外长声明
    印度“自由报”斥美国武装日本
    【新华社平壤十一日电】“民主朝鲜”和“劳动新闻”等报十日都以显著地位，刊载我周恩来外交部长关于美国宣布非法的单独对日和约生效的声明全文。
    【新华社新德里十四日电】印度加尔各答出版的“自由报”在五月十日以“绝对不能容忍”为题发表社论，谴责在美帝国主义者包庇之下的日本重新军国主义化，并支持中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来的声明。社论指出帝国主义阴谋对于亚洲人民所造成的危险说：“这种危险就是日本在美国的包庇之下重新武装。最近的条约只是美国为了加速备战而强迫签订的单独‘和’约。
    实际上，即使在签订这个条约以前，流血惨剧就已不仅出现在亚洲的一个角落，而且出现在亚洲的几乎每一处地方。亚洲各国人民的自由和主权还在继续受到狂暴的干涉。在朝鲜进行细菌战就是这种狂暴行为的确凿证明。
    这种现象不仅限于朝鲜一地，马来亚也传出了暴行的消息。邱吉尔奴才政府步着美国战争罪犯匪首的后尘，正在马来亚解放区金黄色的谷田里散布毒药。野蛮的英国刽子手们，把解放军俘虏拿去斩首取乐。对于这种从朝鲜一直扩展到马来亚的死亡的舞蹈，印度不能再沉默了。因为这是我们大家的危险，需要共同抵制。”
    该报又指出伟大的亚洲人民的力量说：“针对着匪帮们的掠夺、破坏与细菌战的凶焰，朝鲜、越南、马来亚、缅甸、菲律宾和印度尼西亚的人民已经胜利地筑起了一道抵抗的长城。由于受了一次又一次的打击，帝国主义者采取了极端野蛮的手段。但是由于它本身的脆弱，使它更加拚命挣扎，不顾一切；它急不可耐地企图使死灰复燃，在全亚洲和全世界点起新的战火。自由而伟大的中国的强大力量，是站在亚洲各国人民的解放斗争方面的。作为亚洲和平与安全的保证的，还有中苏的友谊。”
    社论最后说：“帝国主义的强盗行为与疯狂暴行，每一次都在亚洲各地受到严重的打击。印度全国人民表示完全同意中国外交部长周恩来先生的声明：这种疯狂行为与在亚洲大陆发动新战争的阴谋，是绝对不能容忍的。”
    又讯：印度和巴基斯坦各地的许多报纸都刊载了我国外交部长周恩来在五月五日就对日和约问题所发表的声明的摘要。
