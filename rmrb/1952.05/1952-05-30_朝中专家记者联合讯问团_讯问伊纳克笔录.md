Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The following is the transcript of the interrogation of Inoc by the "Joint Investigation Team of Korean and Chinese Experts and Journalists" on May 6, 1952. The full text is as follows:

    1. Please tell us your resume before you were captured.
    Answer: My name is Kenneth L. Inoc, Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. My military number is AO—2069988.
    I was born on January 14, 1925, in Washington City, Pennsylvania. Currently, I live with my mother, brother, sister, and brother-in-law at 18 South Osborne Street, Youngstown, Ohio. I graduated from middle school in January 1943, worked in a steel factory, and joined the U.S. Army Air Corps on June 7, 1943. After basic, shooting, and navigation training, I received training as a navigator for B-24 aircraft at Casper, Wyoming, and Langley Airfield, Virginia. During World War II, I served in China and Okinawa, carrying out twenty-one flight missions. After being discharged in 1947, I worked in several steel factories and studied at university for two years. Then I found a job in a power company. I was recalled to serve in the Korean War there.
    In mid-August 1951, I was sent to the Far East and arrived in Korea on September 1. My base was Gunsan. My unit was the 3rd Bombardment Wing commanded by Colonel Omen of the 5th Air Force, the 3rd Bombardment Group commanded by Colonel Morgan, and the 8th Bombardment Squadron commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Lee Ae.
    I carried out thirty-two flight missions in Korea. All were B-26 bombers. Our main task was to attack supply lines - vehicles, trains, roads, bridges, railway yards and airports. I performed thirty ordinary missions and two missions of dropping germ bombs.
    2. When, where and how were you captured?
    Answer: On the evening of January 13, 1952, during our last flight, I was flying with Lieutenant Quinn, the pilot, Lieutenant Tonnes, the bombardier, and Sergeant Campbell, the mechanic. I was the navigator. We were flying B-26 bomber No. 600 and were ordered to bomb the railway yard in Anzhou. We took off from Gunsan at 21:45 and reached the target area at 23:30, where we were hit by anti-aircraft fire at an altitude of 15,000 feet. We began to descend rapidly, and I parachuted down at 23:35, landing about ten miles northwest of Sunan. When I jumped, the plane was about 1,500 feet above the ground. Because I couldn't find my ripcord, my parachute only opened when I was fifty feet from the ground. I hit the ground instantly, and there I unloaded my parachute. My first thought was to escape, but the terrain made this impossible, and soon I was surrounded by personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The plane had crashed and was burning half a mile away. I heard that Lieutenant Quinn had also landed safely. I met him in Pyongyang on the last day of January.
    3. When and how were you trained in germ warfare?
    Answer: From 13:00 to 15:00 on August 25, 1951, I attended a lecture at the ground school in Iwakuni, Japan. It was about germ bombs and was given by a non-military person named Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson emphasized that this lesson was highly confidential and that its contents should not be disclosed to anyone. There were about twenty-five people in attendance, ten pilots and fifteen navigators. Among the pilots, I remember Lieutenant Guy Broughton, Captain Frank Lemek, and Lieutenant Elton Schmidt. Among the navigators, besides myself, I remember Lieutenant Emmett Hardy, Lieutenant Lloyd Daggu, Lieutenant Ronald Blanc, Second Lieutenant Larry Gilinsky, Second Lieutenant John Larson, Lieutenant Charles Gervin, and Captain Kenneth Carson.
    Mr. Wilson talked about various types of germ warfare weapons. He said you could carry a bomb that looks like a regular bomb, but is filled with insects and germs, and opens upon impact, releasing its contents. You can not only carry this regular germ bomb, but you can also carry containers made of cardboard, filled with germs and insects, which will also break open upon contact with the ground. You can drop containers with small animals and rodents carrying germs and insects by parachute. These small animals can also be placed from ships onto the enemy's rear coastline. Another method is to spray germ-laden dust directly from an airplane. You can also drop containers filled with germs into lakes, rivers, and reservoirs to poison the water for human and animal consumption. You can also drop things like leaflets, pens, clothes, food, etc., that are carrying germs. Typhoid, typhus, cholera, smallpox, bubonic plague, malaria, yellow fever, encephalitis, dysentery and many other germs can be used. Flies, fleas, mosquitoes, lice, and many other insects can be used to carry germs. Small animals such as rats and birds can be used to carry these germs and insects, for example, rats carrying fleas infected with plague germs.
    Mr. Wilson talked about some methods of defending against germ warfare, the purpose of which was naturally to make our own personnel understand how to protect ourselves when we carried out germ warfare.
    After the lecture, Mr. Wilson re-emphasized the extreme confidentiality of the contents.
    In October and December 1951, I attended two lectures on germ warfare in Gunsan, given by Propaganda and Education Officer Major Browning.
    4. Please tell us the detailed circumstances of your dropping germ bombs.
    Answer: I carried out two missions to drop germ bombs:
    At 14:00 on January 6, 1952, I heard the mission briefing in the briefing room of the 3rd Bombardment Group in Gunsan, which was delivered by Group Adjutant Captain Gilbert Galle. There were twenty-four personnel flying that night. Our group consisted of Captain William Ames, the pilot, Sergeant Lee Chu Xi, the gunner, and myself. We were ordered to fly along "Green Route 8" between Pyongyang and Sariwon. We took off at 03:00 on January 7.
    At 02:00 on the morning of January 7, Captain Ames and I reported to the Group Operations Officer to see if there were any changes to the orders. This is a normal procedure. At this time, Captain Robert Stewart of the Group Operations Section told us about a secret change in the orders. He told us to drop two germ bombs on Huangzhou. He told us that the two bombs on the outer wing racks were germ bombs to be dropped on Huangzhou, with a maximum altitude of 500 feet and a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour when dropping the bombs. He said the bombs had been loaded and checked, and after we dropped the two germ bombs, we should drop the rest of the bombs as quickly as possible and return to base immediately. During the report, we had to report that the two germ bombs were "non-explosive bombs" to keep the secret.
    We took Sergeant Chu Xi to B-26 aircraft No. 247 in the squadron operations section. A guard sent by the Ordnance Section next to the plane told us not to worry about the two bombs under the wings, because they had already checked them, which we already knew. This was not the usual procedure, because we had never seen guards during regular missions. I checked the six 500-pound regular bombs in the bomb bay, in addition to the two germ bombs on the outer wing racks, and two 500-pound regular bombs on the inner wing racks.
    We took off at 03:00 and went straight to Huangzhou. In the Sariwon area, we dropped to an altitude of 500 feet and a speed of 200 miles per hour. At 04:00, we dropped two germ bombs on the western edge of Huangzhou. I recorded them as "two 500-pound non-explosive bombs." We proceeded north for five miles, then returned to an altitude of 1,500 feet and dropped the rest of the regular bombs closely on the road. Normally, the minimum bombing altitude for 500-pound bombs should be around 1,200 feet.
    At 05:00 we returned to Gunsan, and in the post-mission briefing we reported the situation to the personnel of the Group Intelligence Section. In addition to making the routine report, we also reported that we dropped "two 500-pound non-explosive bombs" in Huangzhou, and eight 500-pound bombs on the road and railway north of Huangzhou.
    On January 10, Captain Ames, Sergeant Chu Xi, and I were again assigned to fly aircraft No. 247, "Green Route 8." We were scheduled to take off at 03:00 the next morning. At 02:00 on the morning of January 11, Captain Ames and I reported to the Group Operations Section. They told us to drop germ bombs again. This time we were to drop four germ bombs on Junghwa. The bombs were loaded on the inner and outer wing racks and, as before, were checked by others for us. This time, the rest of the instructions we heard were the same as on January 6. The adjutant was the same person as before. We took off at 03:00 and dropped to an altitude of 1,000 feet in the Sariwon area. As we flew north towards Junghwa, we descended to 500 feet above the ground. Several miles from Junghwa, we reached the city at an altitude of 500 feet and a speed of 190 miles per hour. At 04:10 we dropped four germ bombs in the western part of Junghwa. Then we flew south to the road and railway five miles north of Huangzhou, where we dropped the rest of the bombs at an altitude of 1,500 feet.
    At 05:15 we returned to Gunsan. During the briefing, we reported the four germ bombs dropped on Junghwa as "non-explosive bombs," and the other six bombs were dropped on the road and railway north of Huangzhou.
    5. How have you been treated since you were sent to the prisoner-of-war camp? What are your thoughts on this?
    Answer: After arriving at the prisoner-of-war camp, I received good treatment. I received warm clothes, enough good food, medical care, tobacco, sugar, special holiday meals, toiletries and many other considerations. Now that the weather is warmer, I have also received summer clothing.
    I feel that the treatment I have received is very humane and reasonable. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have adopted a correct and noble attitude.

    “朝中专家记者联合讯问团”讯问伊纳克笔录
    【新华社二十九日讯】一九五二年五月六日“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”讯问伊纳克笔录。全文如下：
    1、请将你被俘前的简历告诉我们。
    答：我的名字叫凯尼斯·L·伊纳克，美国空军中尉。我的军号是AO—2069988。
    我于一九二五年一月十四日生于宾夕法尼亚州的华盛顿城。目前我和我的母亲，哥哥，妹妹和妹夫一道住在俄亥俄州的杨斯顿城南奥斯本街十八号。一九四三年一月我中学毕业，在一家钢铁厂做事，于一九四三年六月七日加入美国陆军航空队。经过基本的、射击的及领航的训练后，我就在怀俄明州的加斯派尔和弗吉尼亚州的兰格利机场受B—24型飞机的领航员的训练。在第二次大战期中我在中国及冲绳岛服役，执行过二十一次飞行任务。一九四七年退伍之后，我曾在几个钢铁厂做过事，在大学里念了二年书。然后我在一家电力公司里找到职业。我就在那里重新被召服役参加朝鲜战争。
    一九五一年八月中旬我被派至远东，九月一日到达朝鲜，我的基地是群山。我的部别是第五航空队欧门上校指挥的第三轰炸联队，摩根上校指挥的第三轰炸大队，李埃中校指挥的第八轰炸中队。
    我在朝鲜执行过三十二次飞行任务。都是B—26型轰炸机。我们的任务主要是攻击供应线——车辆，火车，公路，桥梁，铁路车场和飞机场。我执行过三十次普通任务及两次投细菌弹的任务。
    2、你是在什么时候，什么地方以及如何被俘的？
    答：一九五二年一月十三日的晚上，我们最后的一次飞行中，和我一块飞行的有驾驶员奎恩中尉、轰炸手唐内士中尉和机械师坎拜尔中士。我是领航员。我们飞的是第600号B—26型轰炸机，受命轰炸安州的铁路车场。我们于二十一点四十五分钟从群山起飞，于二十三点三十分钟到达目标上空，在一万五千英尺的上空被高射炮火所击中。我们开始很快的下降，我于二十三点三十五分钟跳伞降落于顺安西北约十英里的地方。我跳伞时，飞机约离地一千五百英尺。由于我找不到我的开伞索，我的降落伞到离地面五十英尺时才开启。瞬那间我触到地面，在那里我卸下我的降落伞。我第一个念头就是想逃走，但是那里的地形使这个想法不可能实现，不久我就被中国人民志愿军部队的人员所包围。飞机已撞毁，在半英里以外的地方燃烧着。我听说奎恩中尉也安全降落了。在一月的最后一天我在平壤碰见了他。
    3、你是在什么时候和如何受到细菌战的训练的？
    答：一九五一年八月二十五日下午一时到三时我在日本岩国地面学校听过一次讲课。讲的是关于细菌弹，是由一个名叫威尔逊先生的非军事人员讲的。威尔逊先生着重地说，这一课非常秘密，不准把它内容泄露给任何人。听讲的约有二十五个人，十个驾驶员和十五个领航员。驾驶员中我记得有盖·白劳顿中尉，佛朗克·莱麦克上尉以及艾尔顿·史密德中尉。在领航员中除我外，我记得有艾密特·哈地中尉，劳埃·戴古中尉，洛纳尔德·白朗中尉，拉利·吉林斯基少尉，约翰·拉荪少尉，却尔士·格尔文中尉以及凯尼斯·卡生上尉。
    威尔逊先生谈到各种不同的细菌战武器。他谈到你可以带一种炸弹，看起来很像普通炸弹，不过是装满了昆虫和细菌的，触地后即行开启，放出里面所装的东西来。你不仅可以带这种正规的细菌弹，而且还可以带用纸板做成的容器，里面装有细菌和昆虫，在接触地面时也会裂开来，你可以用降落伞投下装着带有细菌及昆虫的小动物及啮齿类动物的容器。这些小动物也可以从船上放到敌人后方的海岸上去。还有一种方法就是直接地从一架飞机上喷射带细菌的灰尘。你也可以把装有细菌的容器丢到湖泊，河流，蓄水池里去以毒化人畜饮用的水。你也可以投下像传单，水笔，衣服，食物等带有细菌的东西。伤寒，斑疹伤寒，霍乱，天花，腺鼠疫，疟疾，黄热病，脑炎，痢疾和其他许多细菌都可以应用。像苍蝇，跳蚤，蚊子，虱子和其他许多昆虫都可以用来携带细菌。像老鼠和小鸟兽一类的小动物便可以用来携带这些细菌和昆虫，譬如老鼠携带染有鼠疫菌的跳蚤等。
    威尔逊先生讲述了一些防御细菌战的方法，其目的自然是使我们自己的人员懂得一些在我们进行细菌战时如何保护我们自己的办法。
    在授课完毕以后，威尔逊先生再度强调内容的极度机密性。
    一九五一年十月和十二月，我在群山听了两堂有关细菌战的讲课，讲课人是宣传教育军官白朗宁少校。
    4、请将你投掷细菌弹的详细情形告诉我们。
    答：我执行了两次投细菌弹的任务：
    一九五二年一月六日十四时，我在群山第三轰炸大队传令室听取传达任务报告，我们由大队传令官吉伯特·加莱上尉传达任务。那天晚上有二十四个人员飞行。我们的一组是驾驶员威廉·阿麦斯上尉，机枪手李却·屈西中士和我，我们奉命沿着平壤和沙里院间的“绿色第8航线”飞行。我们起飞的时间是一月七日，早晨三时。
    一月七日早晨两点钟阿麦斯上尉和我到大队作战官那儿报到，看看命令是不是有什么改变。这是通常的一种程序。这时候，大队作战科的罗伯特·史第华上尉，便告诉我们秘密改变命令。他告诉我们在黄州投下两枚细菌弹。他告诉我们机翼外架上的两枚炸弹是要在黄州投下的细菌弹，投弹时的最大高度是五百英尺，最大飞行速是每小时两百英里。他说炸弹都已经装好而且检查过了，我们在投下两枚细菌弹以后，应尽快的把其余的炸弹扔掉，立刻回到基地来。在汇报时，我们须报告说这两枚细菌弹是“不爆炸的炸弹”以保守秘密。
    我们在中队作战股带上屈西中士到第二四七号的B—26型飞机。飞机旁边有一个军械科派来的警卫告诉我们不要管机翼下的两枚炸弹，因为他们已经检查过了，这个我们早就知道了。这不是平常的程序，因为一般出勤时我们都从没见过警卫。我检查一下炸弹舱内的六枚五百磅重的普通炸弹，在两枚机翼外架上的细菌弹之外，在机翼内架上还有两枚五百磅的普通炸弹。
    我们在早晨三时起飞，直接向黄州进发。在沙里院地区，我们便降低到五百英尺的高度和每小时二百英里的飞行速度。四时整，我们在黄州的西缘投下了两枚细菌弹。我把它们当作“两枚五百磅不爆炸的炸弹”记录下来。我们向北前进了五英里，便恢复到一千五百英尺的高度，紧密的在公路上投下了其余的普通炸弹。通常五百磅重炸弹的最低投弹高度应当是一千二百英尺左右。
    早晨五点钟我们回到了群山，在任务后的汇报中我们向大队情报科的军人汇报了情况。在作了例行的报告外，我们还报告了我们在黄州扔下了“两枚五百磅不爆炸的炸弹”，在黄州北面的公路和铁路上扔下了八枚五百磅炸弹。
    一月十日我和阿麦斯上尉，屈西中士又被派定担任247号机，“绿色第8航线”的飞行。我们应于次晨三时起飞。一月十一日晨二时，阿麦斯上尉和我到大队作战科报到。他们又告诉我们去投细菌弹。这一次我们应去中和投掷四枚细菌弹。炸弹装在机翼内外架上而且和上次一样也是由别人替我们检查的。这一次，我们所听取的其余的通知和一月六日的相同。传令官也是前次那个人。我们在早晨三时起飞在沙里院地区降低到一千英尺的高度。我们向北往中和飞行时，降到离地五百英尺。在距中和数英里时我们在五百英尺的高度，以每小时一百九十英里飞行速度到达这个城的上空。四时十分我们在中和西区投下了四枚细菌弹。然后往南飞行到达黄州北五英里的公路和铁路上空，我们在一千五百英尺高度投下了其余的炸弹。
    五时十五分我们回到群山。汇报时，我们把在中和投下的四枚细菌弹报告成“不爆炸的炸弹”，其他的六枚炸弹是在黄州北公路和铁路上投下的。
    5、你被送到俘虏营以后所受到的待遇如何？对此你有什么感想？
    答：到达俘虏营后，我受到良好的待遇。我领到了暖和的衣服，足量的好食物，医疗，烟草，食糖，假日的特别饭食，盥洗用具和其他很多照顾。现在天气暖和了，我又领到了夏季服装。
    我感到我所受到的待遇是很人道和很合理的，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军采取了正确而高尚的态度。
