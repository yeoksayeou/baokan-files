In a guest house of the Central People's Government Personnel Department, the reporter interviewed Zhang Junde, a teacher at the Affiliated Elementary School of Xi'an Normal School in Shaanxi Province, who created the "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" (originally called the Three-Sphere Instrument). He was in Beijing to complete the formalities for being transferred to the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory in Nanjing for study. He said to the reporter: "Since the founding of New China, I have deeply realized that Chinese youth living in the Mao Zedong era are the happiest and most glorious. Because in such an era, a young person can truly exert creative power to serve their motherland and the working people." He believes that his experience is a powerful example.

He is from Zhangjiabao, Tianhe Township, Second District, Hu County, Shaanxi Province, 29 years old, a junior high school graduate, and a member of the New Democratic Youth League (over-age member). His family was originally of poor peasant background, and only after liberation did his family receive eleven mu of cultivated land and seven fen of bamboo forest. He was able to graduate from junior high school mainly because his mother earned some money by selling cloth, and by using the method of
"robbing Peter to pay Paul, taking sleeves to patch trousers" to make ends meet.

In the summer of 1944, after graduating from junior high school, he became a teacher in an elementary school in northern Hu County, teaching natural science. When he talked about why there is day and night, as well as solar and lunar eclipses, because there was no instrument to explain these problems, even with great effort in explaining, the students could not understand. This stumped him. At this time, he thought of what a teacher named Li Yuzhi said when he was in junior high school: "Misleading children is like killing their parents." A high sense of responsibility made him uneasy. He made up his mind that he must create an instrument that could explain these problems.

The environment in the countryside was very difficult, and he could not even find a reference book. It was not until November of that year that he saw a diagram in a book published by the Commercial Press for children's knowledge guidance, "Astronomy Collection," which used loquats to represent the moon, apples to represent the earth, and candles to represent the sun to explain the causes of the seasons, solar eclipses, and lunar eclipses. This diagram gave him great inspiration. So in the spring of 1945, when he was teaching at Zhongnan Elementary School in southern Hu County, he began to try to make such an instrument.

Making instruments requires tools and wood. Fortunately, his father-in-law ran a carpentry shop, and he ran to his father-in-law's house every Sunday. At that time, he was criticized a lot, such as saying that he did not teach well and ran to his father-in-law's house every Sunday, etc. But he ignored these criticisms and devoted himself to research work. Finally, he made a globe and a moon globe. However, the structure of the instrument at this time was still very simple. He only used wood as a support, mud to make the earth and the moon, and a vegetable oil lamp to replace the sun. At that time, his material conditions were so poor that he could not even afford a vegetable oil lamp, so when the instrument was made, he had to borrow the lamps used for worship in the temple (Zhongnan Elementary School was in a temple) when experimenting with the students. At this time, the instrument could only explain the causes of the seasons, the phases of the moon, and the reasons for lunar and solar eclipses. Although it had achieved great results in auxiliary teaching (such as solving problems that could not be solved in a week in 1944, which now only took an hour to solve), it still had many shortcomings: First, the earth of the globe could not rotate, and its revolution was not obvious; second, the earth of the moon globe could not rotate, so it could not well explain the cycle of day and night and the changes of the seasons.

In the autumn of 1945, with the determination to continue studying this instrument, he entered the Fine Arts and Crafts Department of Shaanxi Provincial Xi'an Vocational Normal School (at public expense). Every day, in addition to doing the work prescribed by the school, he devoted himself to modifying his globe and moon globe. In October of that year, he successfully modified the second globe and moon globe. This time, the modified instrument was much better than the first one. The earth and the moon were both made of wood, and the sun was replaced by a candle; the revolution of the earth and the revolution of the moon were also more obvious, but the earth still could not rotate. The students around him discussed one after another, saying: "Zhang Junde doesn't study painting well and makes carpentry all day long!" "Since he loves making carpentry, he should go to a carpentry shop to learn carpentry!" Some even ridiculed him and said: "Zhang Junde is going to the carpentry shop to invent and create again!" He ignored these criticisms and continued to study and improve his instrument.

In the spring of 1946, he modified the moon globe for the third time. This time, the earth could rotate 30 times, and the moon revolved around the earth once (in fact, the earth rotates 29 and a half times before the moon revolves around the earth once, but he did not know this at the time). Then he wanted to modify the globe, but when the instrument manufacturing factory of the puppet Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education discovered that he was not doing ordinary handicraft, but making instruments, all the tools were no longer lent to him. He had no choice but to write a "report" to the puppet Department of Education, requesting to continue lending him tools. But the letter was like a stone falling into the sea, without any news. So he went to the carpentry shop to make it, but he could not make it. Soon, because of a family split, his father wanted him to go back to support the family, so he had to leave the vocational normal school. But as soon as he got home, he fell ill. It was not until September of that year that he recovered and found a teaching position at Xinken Elementary School in Hu County. During this period, he modified the globe for the third time.

On New Year's Day in 1947, Xinken Elementary School held a results exhibition. Zhang Junde exhibited his two instruments at this meeting, which aroused great interest among the people in the neighboring villages, who said: "The school is 'showing off treasures' today!" Some farmers even said after listening to his explanation: "So the heavenly dog eating the moon (lunar eclipse) is like this!" In this way, some students paid attention and said: "Let the government (puppet government) help promote it!" Zhang Junde was afraid that it would be "impossible," but he finally wrote two letters to the puppet Education Section Chief of Hu County through his teacher named Cao Wenqing. There was no reply. Later, with the help of his teacher named Cao Wenqing, the puppet Education Section reluctantly agreed to discuss it at a joint meeting of principals to be held in the county in the autumn. On the day the joint meeting of principals opened, he ran to the meeting place very early, but he was not called in until it was almost dark and the meeting was about to end. Before he could talk about the creative process of the instrument, a principal named Yan Guangcheng stood up and said to him in a very bad tone: "I think you seem to have a lot of research on astronomy, so I have a question to ask you: Why does the moon fall in the northwest in the early part of each month in summer? And why does the moon fall in the southwest in the early part of each month in winter?" Zhang Junde was frightened by this sudden "interrogation." In the time it took to scratch his head, the order of the meeting was already in chaos. Some said: "A young child knows nothing!" Some said: "A 'hillbilly' (equivalent to 'country bumpkin') wants to invent an instrument!" Saying that, they dispersed in a rush.

Narrating to this point, Zhang Junde said: "There was no way, so I had to leave the meeting place. When I came out, the puppet Education Section Chief also said: 'It depends on whether this thing is useful!' I didn't say anything at the time, but I said in my heart: 'The use of the thing is not small, it's just that I am useless!' So I went back to school. On the way back to school, I felt really sad, I wanted to cry. The city was only ten miles away from the school. Although it was a flash when I came, it was already dark at this time. Walking more than ten miles was like climbing dozens of mountains and ridges in the dark night." He was silent for a while, and continued: "Less than a week after returning to school, I wrote a written answer to the question raised by the principal named Yan Guangcheng, and drew a picture. But I never received his reply. The problem is very obvious, the old society is a society that suppresses young people and harms young people! But I didn't fall down in this situation. On the contrary, this taught me, improved my understanding of the old society, and gave me the power to resist and fight it!" In less than a month, Zhang Junde modified his instrument again. This instrument can not only explain the direction of the moon's rise and fall, but also combine the moon globe and the globe together, which is the prototype of today's "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument."

In the spring of 1948, there was a solar eclipse in central China. In advance, Yiguandao spread rumors everywhere, saying: "A great disaster is coming, the sky will be dark for forty-nine days. Good people will be spared from disaster, and bad people will die." They also deceived the farmers, saying: "Only by entering the Tao, burning more incense, and kowtowing more can you eliminate disasters and difficulties." Some people were affected by these rumors, and did not do farm work. Some people sold their fields, ate and drank extravagantly, waiting for death. At that time, Zhang Junde used this "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" to explain the cause of the solar eclipse to the children and the villagers. He also wrote an article explaining why the phenomenon of "black tiger eating the sun" (solar eclipse) occurred, with diagrams attached, and posted it on the wall. His strength alone was still very small, able to persuade a few people, but not able to persuade most people. Therefore, he felt that this instrument should not only be improved, but also be promoted in the countryside, in order to popularize astronomical knowledge and eliminate superstition.

In the winter of that year, he taught at Bantianhe Elementary School in the Second District of Hu County. Because he accused the corrupt principal, he was detained by the puppet county government on the charge of "false accusation." Later, with the help of several teachers and guarantees, he was reluctantly released, but he was not allowed to teach anymore. The fifth modified "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" was completed during his unemployment, which was in the spring of 1949. At this time, his situation was even more difficult. Not only was he ridiculed by outsiders, but even his father could not understand him. His father said: "It's okay if you can't teach, but you can't learn carpentry!" But he knew that his hometown was about to be liberated, and his work would be supported after liberation, so he still only focused on modifying this "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument."

On May 20, 1949, his hometown, Hu County, was indeed liberated. After liberation, he immediately participated in teacher training and joined the New Democratic Youth League in October of the same year. In June 1950, he wrote a letter to the Xi'an Mass Daily, saying that he had created an "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument." The Mass Daily immediately forwarded the letter to the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education. In less than a month, he was transferred to Xi'an. In order to give him the opportunity to continue researching and improving this instrument, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Culture and Education not only kept him working at the Affiliated Elementary School of Xi'an Normal School, but also invited Professor Zhang Zhonghui of Northwest University to appraise this instrument for him and help him theoretically. Professor Zhang Zhonghui said: "This instrument is very good, as long as it is modified, it will be very useful." Under the guidance of Professor Zhang Zhonghui, and after painstaking research during the winter vacation of 1950, a drawing of the "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" designed for the sixth time was completed on February 5, 1951. Later, with the help of the Science Popularization Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee Culture Department and the enthusiastic work of the workers of Xi'an Yiming Machine Factory, his "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" was finally successfully manufactured before the "May Day" festival in 1951.

Narrating to this point, Zhang Junde once again pointed out the completely different treatment of the same creative work in New China and Old China. He said:

"I will never forget that if a Mao Zedong era did not appear in China, if there were no cultivation and education of me by the Party and the League, this 'Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument' would not have appeared. So this glory should not belong to me alone, it should first belong to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" Saying that, he got up and moved his "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" from under the bed. This "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" was modified after he attended the Third Meeting of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year. It looks very exquisite now, all made of metal. It was originally made of a light bulb, two balls of different sizes, eleven gears of different sizes, and two gearless gears. The light bulb represents the sun, in the center of the disc. The big ball represents the earth, the upper end of the earth is the North Pole, the lower end is the South Pole, and the white circle in the middle is the equator; the circle north of the equator is the Tropic of Cancer, the circle south of the equator is the Tropic of Capricorn, blue represents the ocean, and red represents the land. It is installed on an elliptical circumference centered on the light bulb (sun) at an inclination of twenty-three and a half degrees, and revolves around the light bulb (sun) by using the rotation of the gears. When the big ball (that is, the earth) revolves around the light bulb (sun), the big ball (earth) itself is not only rotating, but the sun and the moon are also rotating at the same time. On the outside of the circumference, there is also a flat iron ring that is the same height as the center of the sun and earth. This iron ring is used to represent the ecliptic. On the ecliptic, there are notes on the four seasons, as well as the names and positions of the "twelve constellations of the zodiac."

According to Zhang Junde, this "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument" can currently explain more than a dozen astronomical phenomena. First, it is the relationship between the moon and the earth orbiting the sun in the universe. He said that when we turn the hand crank, the earth rotates around the sun in a counterclockwise direction (revolution), and at the same time rotates in the same direction (rotation). One revolution is more than 365 rotations. The time for one rotation is called one "day", and the time for one revolution is called one "year", so there are 365 and almost a quarter of a day in a year. The moon revolves around the earth in more than 27 days, and this period of time is called a "sidereal month". Second, it is the difference between a sidereal month and a synodic month. He said that the "month" we usually talk about is not a "sidereal month", but a "solar month" or a "lunar month". The average length of a "solar month" is almost 30 and a half days. A "lunar month" is also called a "synodic month", which is the time between one full moon and the next, which is 29 and a half days long. A "sidereal month" uses a fixed star as a standard. For example, taking a star in Taurus as a standard, the earth, the moon, and a star in Taurus are in a straight line. After the moon revolves around the earth for one week, the earth, the moon, and a star in Taurus are again in a straight line, and the time interval is a "sidereal month". A "synodic month" uses the sun as a standard. When the moon and the sun are on opposite sides of the earth, people on earth see a full moon. The moon revolves, and the earth also revolves. Because they both rotate in the same direction, the time from full moon to full moon is more than two days longer than a "sidereal month." Third, it is the difference between a "sidereal day" and a "solar day". He said that the time it takes for the earth to rotate once is called a "sidereal day", and the time it takes for a certain point on earth from noon to noon is called a "solar day". The earth is rotating on one hand and revolving on the other. The direction of rotation is the same, so a solar day is a little longer than a sidereal day (about four minutes). Fourth, it is the cause of day and night. He said that the earth is a sphere, so at any time, sunlight can only shine on one half of the earth's surface. The side that is illuminated is day, and the side that is facing away from the sun is night. The earth is constantly rotating, so day and night are constantly circulating. Near the poles of the earth, half a year is day and half a year is night. Fifth, the earth's axis of rotation and axis of revolution are not parallel. He said that this is clearly shown on the instrument. The earth's axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, but forms an angle of sixty-six and a half degrees. That is to say, the earth's equator and the ecliptic intersect at an angle of twenty-three and a half degrees. This angle is the so-called "obliquity of the ecliptic." Sixth, is the reason for the changes in the four seasons. He said, "obliquity of the ecliptic" is the main reason for the changes in the four seasons. The direction of the earth's axis of rotation is almost unchanged in hundreds of years, so during the year, in temperate regions, sometimes the sunlight shines directly, and sometimes the sunlight shines obliquely. At the summer solstice, the sunlight shines directly on the Tropic of Cancer. In the northern temperate zone, the night is short and the day is long, and the sunlight is strong, so the climate is hot. The situation in winter is exactly the opposite. In spring and autumn, the sunlight shines directly in the middle of the earth (equator). The sunlight in the temperate zone is not as direct as in summer, nor as oblique as in winter, so it is neither hot nor cold. Day and night are also equal. Seventh, the point of perihelion and aphelion when the earth revolves around the sun. He said, the orbit of the earth around the sun is an ellipse, and an ellipse always has two centers (foci), and the sun is on one center, so the earth is sometimes far from the sun and sometimes close to the sun. The farthest point is called "aphelion," and the closest point is called "perihelion." Ten days after the summer solstice, the earth is at the aphelion; ten days after the winter solstice, the earth is at the perihelion. This proves that the cold and heat changes in our temperate regions are mainly due to the direct and oblique sunlight. Eighth, is the reason for the phases of the moon. He said, the moon does not emit light itself, but reflects the sunlight that shines on its surface into our eyes. The moon is constantly revolving around the earth, so the half of its surface that is lit is sometimes facing us entirely, sometimes only facing us partly, and sometimes facing away from us entirely. This is the reason for the phases of the moon. Ninth, is the rotation of the moon. He said that the moon always faces us with almost the same side; this indicates that the moon is also rotating. The time it takes to rotate once is equal to the time it takes to revolve once. If the moon did not rotate, we should see all parts of its surface in turn during the time it takes to revolve around the earth, and we should not always see the same part. The structure of this instrument can also fully explain this point. Tenth, is the reason for solar and lunar eclipses. He said that when the moon moves between the sun and the earth, and the sun, moon, and earth become a straight line, the phenomenon of solar eclipse occurs. The moon is much smaller than the sun, so each time a solar eclipse occurs, it is only visible in a small part of the earth. When the moon moves outside the earth, the earth is between the sun and the moon, and the sun, earth, and moon become a straight line, the sunlight is blocked by the earth and cannot reach the moon, and half of the earth's surface facing away from the sun sees the lunar eclipse phenomenon. Solar eclipses always occur at the new moon (first day of the lunar calendar); lunar eclipses always occur at the full moon (fifteenth day of the lunar calendar). Eleventh, the moon's orbit is not on the ecliptic plane. He said that the moon's orbit (the white path) forms an angle of five degrees and eight minutes with the ecliptic plane. This is called the "angle of the white and yellow paths." It is precisely because of this "angle of the white and yellow paths" that there is not a solar or lunar eclipse every month. Twelfth, is the reason for the change in the direction of the moon's rise and fall. He said that because of the existence of the "obliquity of the ecliptic" and the "angle of the white and yellow paths," the position of the moon on the horizon when it rises every day is constantly changing. In winter, the moon rises from the northeast, and in summer it rises from the southeast. The moon is on the horizon for a long time in winter nights, and short in summer nights; so there is more moonlight in winter and less moonlight in summer. This phenomenon, now there is no need to "scratch your head" anymore, it will be very clear from this instrument. Thirteenth, the shape of the moon's orbit (white path). He said, the moon is running around the earth on the one hand, and running around the sun in a continuous shape on the other hand. Fourteenth, the lunar calendar month has twenty-nine days and thirty days, and the reason for the three-year leap month and the five-year leap two months can also be seen clearly on this instrument. He said, the lunar calendar month is calculated according to the phase of the moon, and a month is from new moon to new moon. Because it takes about twenty-nine and a half days from new moon to new moon, for the convenience of calculation, it is moved around half a day, so the month has twenty-nine days and thirty days. One month is twenty-nine and a half days, and twelve months is a total of three hundred and fifty-four days, which is eleven days more than the time it actually takes for the earth to revolve around the sun, about three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days. Three years is thirty-three days, and five years is fifty-five days, so only three years with a leap month and five years with two leap months can be correct. Fifteenth, the sun is a fixed star, but when we look at the sun from the earth, we will feel that the sun is moving (actually the earth is moving). In a year, this route that looks like the sun is moving in the sky on earth is the so-called ecliptic. This point can also be seen clearly on this instrument. Sixteenth, the rotation of the sun. He said that not only the earth and the moon are always rotating, but the sun is also always rotating. This was improved after returning from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year. Originally, the sun on this instrument could not rotate yet.

Next, Zhang Junde showed me a "Wind and Rain Experimenter" that he made after this "Earth-Moon Orbiting Instrument." He said very modestly: "This instrument is still very simple, and currently it can only explain the causes of wind and rain and the combustion-supporting properties of oxygen. But it doesn't cost much money. It only takes 60,000 to 70,000 yuan to make one. I think if it is taken to the countryside, it can let the villagers know that there are no so-called wind婆 and rain gods in the world. This will be of great help in eliminating superstition and popularizing astronomical knowledge."

Finally, he told the reporter: "This time I go to Nanjing to study, first of all, I must work hard to complete the learning tasks assigned to me by the organization. I suffered a lot of stimulation in the old society, and my brain has problems, and my memory is too bad. I may not be a smart student, but I want to treat those scholars and experts at the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory as my teachers. I know too little, and I will definitely learn from them with a serious attitude. Secondly, I also want to improve this instrument. On the one hand, popularize it to reduce costs, so that every rural elementary school has the power to purchase one; on the other hand, improve it, so that it can explain more astronomical problems for us. But this is definitely not something that I can do alone. I must rely on the strength of the masses!"

    张俊德发明“月地运行仪”的奋斗过程
    徐放
    在中央人民政府人事部的一个招待所里，记者访问了创造“月地运行仪”（原名三球仪）的陕西省西安师范学校附属小学教师张俊德。他这次是因为被调去南京紫金山天文台学习，到北京来办理手续的。他对记者说：“自新中国成立以来，我深深地体会到：生活在毛泽东时代的中国青年是最幸福和最光荣的。因为在这样的时代，一个青年人才能真正发挥创造的力量，为自己的祖国和劳动人民服务。”他认为自己的经历就是一个有力的例证。
    他是陕西省鄠县第二区天和乡张家堡人，现年二十九岁，初中毕业生，新民主主义青年团团员（超龄团员）。家庭原是贫农成分，直到解放后家里才分得耕地十一亩，竹林七分。他所以能读到初级中学毕业，主要是靠母亲卖布赚点钱，以及用
    “拆东墙、补西墙，拆了袖子补裤裆”的挪借办法，才维持下来的。
    一九四四年夏天他在初中卒业后，因为不能继续升学，就在鄠县北乡一个小学校里当教员，教自然课。当他讲到为什么会有白天和黑夜以及日蚀月蚀等问题时，因为没有一个可以说明这些问题的仪器，即使费了很大力气解说，学生也是听不明白。这难住了他。这时他想到在初级中学念书时一个名叫李育之的老师的话：“误人子弟，如杀人之父兄。”高度的责任感，使他的内心不安起来。他就下定决心，非要制作出一个能够说明这些问题的仪器不可。
    乡下的环境是非常困难的，连一本参考书也找不到，直到这年十一月间，他才在商务印书馆出版的一本小朋友各科常识指导读物“天文集”上，看到人家用枇杷代替月球、用苹果代替地球、用蜡烛代替太阳来说明四季、日蚀、月蚀的成因的图解。这图解给他很大的启示。所以当一九四五年春天，他在鄠县南乡终南小学校教书的时候，他便开始尝试制作这样的仪器了。
    作仪器是要工具和木料的。幸好他丈人家开木匠铺，他每到星期天，就往丈人家跑。当时他曾经受到许多非议，如说他不好好教学，一到星期天就跑丈人家等等。可是他没有理会这些，一心一意地进行研究工作，终于作好了一个地球仪和一个月球仪。不过这时的仪器在构造上还十分简陋，只不过用木头来当支架，用泥来作地球和月球，用菜油灯来代替太阳。当时他的物质条件是连一盏菜油灯都买不起的，所以仪器作好了，在给学生试验时，只好借用庙上（终南小学是在一座庙里）敬神的灯。这时的仪器还只不过能说明四季的成因和月亮圆缺以及月蚀日蚀的原因而已，虽然它们在辅助教学上已收到了很大效果（如在一九四四年一个星期解决不了的问题，现在只要一小时就能解决了）。但它们的缺点还是很多的：第一，地球仪的地球不能自转，公转也不明显；第二，月球仪的地球也不能自转，因而不能很好地说明昼夜的循环和四季的变化。
    一九四五年秋天，他怀着继续研究这仪器的决心，考进陕西省立西安技艺师范学校（是公费）的美术劳作科。他每天除作学校里所规定的工作外，一心一意地改作他的地球仪和月球仪。这年十月间，他第二次的地球仪和月球仪果然改作出来了。这次改作的仪器比第一次的仪器好得多了。地球和月球都是木质的，太阳用蜡烛代替；地球的公转和月球的公转也比较明显，只是地球仍不能自转。他周围的同学纷纷议论，都说：“张俊德不好好学绘画，整天作木工！”“既然爱作木工，就到木匠铺去学木匠好啦！”有的还讽刺他说：“张俊德又上木匠铺发明创造去啦！”他没有理会这些，仍旧继续研究和改进他的仪器。
    一九四六年春天，他第三次改作好月球仪。这次地球已能自转三十次，月球绕地球转一次（实际上地球自转二十九次半，月球才绕地球转一次，但是在当时他还不知道这点）。接着他又想改作地球仪，但当伪陕西省教育厅的仪器制造厂发现他不是在作普通的劳作，而是在作仪器时，所有的工具就不再借给他使用了。他无法可想，只好写了个“呈文”给伪教育厅，要求继续借给工具。可是信像石头落在大海里，没有一点消息。于是他就到木匠铺去作，但总是作不起来。不久，他因为家庭闹分家，父亲要他回去养家糊口，不得已他便离开了那技艺师范学校。但一到家他便病倒了，直到这年九月病好起来，他才在鄠县辛垦小学找到了一个教书的位置。他在这期间，第三次改作了地球仪。
    一九四七年元旦辛垦小学开了一次成绩展览会。张俊德在这会上展览了他的两个仪器，这引起邻村的人们的很大兴趣，都说：“学校里今天‘亮宝’啦！”有些农民在听了他的讲解以后还说：“原来天狗吃月亮（月蚀）是这么回事呀！”这样，有些同学便注意起来了，说：“叫政府（伪政府）帮助推广吧！”张俊德怕“办不到”，但终于还是给鄠县伪教育科长写了两封信。一点下文也没有。后来由他一位叫曹文卿的老师给说情，伪教育科才勉强答应在秋天县里召开的一次校长联席会议上讨论一下。校长联席会议开幕的那一天，他很早就跑到开会的地方，但直等到天快黑了，会也要结束了，才把他叫进去。还没等他谈这仪器的创造经过，就有一个叫阎光成的校长站了起来，用十分恶劣的口吻向他说道：“我看你对于天文学好像很有研究的样子，那么我有个问题来请你解答一下：为什么月亮在夏季每月的初旬在西北方落？又为什么月亮在冬季的每月初旬是在西南方落？”张俊德被这突然的“质问”吓住了，在一摸脑袋的工夫，会场的秩序已经大乱。有的说：“一个年青娃娃能懂个屁！”有的说：“南山坎（相当于‘土包子’之意）么，还想发明什么仪器！”说着一哄而散。
    叙述到这里，张俊德说：“没有办法，我也只好离开会场了。出来时那伪教育科长还说：‘就看这东西有没有用处！’我当时没有讲啥，只在心里说：‘东西的用处倒也不小，就是我这人没用！’这样我便回学校了。在回学校的路上我的心里真难过极了，直想哭。城里离学校只有十多里路，来时虽然是一幌就到了，但这时天已经黑下来，走十多里路，就像在黑夜里翻几十道山爬几十道岭一样。”他沉默了一会，继续说道：“回学校不到一星期，我便把那叫阎光成的校长所提的问题作了个书面解答，并画了一张图。可是一直也没见到他的回信。问题是很明显的，旧社会就是打击青年人和损害青年人的社会！但我没有在这种情况下倒下去，相反，这教训了我，使我提高了自己对旧社会的认识，并给了我向它反抗和搏斗的力量！”在不到一个月时间，张俊德就又改作了他的仪器。这仪器不仅可以说明月亮出没的方向问题，而且把月球仪和地球仪结合在一起，这就是今天的“月地运行仪”的雏型。
    一九四八年春天，在中国的中部发生了一次日蚀。事先，一贯道到处大造谣言，说：“大难来了，天要黑七七四十九天。善人免灾，恶人要死尽。”并欺骗农民，说：“只有入道，多烧香、多磕头，才能消灾除难。”有些人受了这些谣言的影响，庄稼活不作了，有的人卖了田地，大吃大喝，等待死亡。那时候，张俊德利用这“月地运行仪”向孩子们、向老乡们解释日蚀的原因。并写了一篇说明为什么发生“黑虎吃太阳”（日蚀）现象的文章，附着图解，贴在墙上。他一个人的力量仍是很小的，能说服少数人，但不能去说服大多数人。因此他觉得：这个仪器，不仅应当改进，还必须在乡村中推广。以便普及天文知识，破除迷信。
    这年冬天，他在鄠县二区八天禾小学教书，因为控告了贪污腐化的校长，被伪县政府扣压了起来，罪名是“诬告”。后来经过几位老师的说情和担保才勉强地被放出来，但书是不许再教了。第五次改作的“月地运行仪”就是他在这失业期间完成的，那是一九四九年的春天。这时他的处境更艰苦了，他不仅被外人讽笑，就连他的父亲也不能体谅他。父亲说：“书教不成也行，可是不能学木匠！”但他知道，家乡快解放了，他的工作，等到解放以后是会得到支持的，所以他仍是只管改作这个“月地运行仪”。
    一九四九年五月二十日，他的家乡——鄠县果然解放了。解放后，他马上便参加了教师学习，并在同年十月参加了新民主主义青年团。一九五○年六月，他写信给西安群众日报社，说他创造了一个“月地运行仪”。群众日报社马上把信转给陕西省人民政府文教厅，不到一个月，他便被调到西安去了。陕西省人民政府文教厅为了叫他得到继续研究改进这仪器的机会，不仅把他留在西安师范附属小学工作，并请了西北大学的张中会教授来给他这个仪器作鉴定，同时在理论上帮助他。张中会教授说：“这仪器很好，只要改一改，用处就大了。”在张中会教授的指导下，又经过一九五○年寒假期间的苦心研究，第六次设计的一张“月地运行仪”的图样，在一九五一年二月五日画好了。后来由于西北军政委员会文化部科学普及处的帮助，和西安市一鸣机器厂的工人同志们的热情工作，他的“月地运行仪”终于在一九五一年“五一”节之前制造成功了。
    叙述到这里，张俊德又一次指出同一创造工作在新中国和旧中国所受到的完全两样的待遇。他说：
    “我将永远不能忘记，如果在中国不出现一个毛泽东时代，如果没有党和团对于我的培养和教育，这‘月地运行仪’是不可能出现的。所以这光荣不应当属于我自己，它首先应当属于共产党和毛主席！”说着他起身从床下搬出了他的“月地运行仪”来。这个“月地运行仪”是在他去年出席第一届中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会第三次会议以后改制过的。它看来已经十分精致了，全部都是金属的。它原是用一个灯泡、两个大小不同的球和十一个大小不等的齿轮以及两个无齿轮做成的。灯泡代表太阳，在圆盘中央。大球代表地球，地球的上端是北极，下端是南极，中间的白线圈是赤道；赤道以北的线圈是北回归线，以南的是南回归线，蓝色表示海洋，红色表示陆地。它以二十三度半的倾斜度，装置在以灯泡为一个圆心的椭圆周上，利用齿轮的转动，围绕着灯泡（太阳）运行。当大球（也就是地球）围绕灯泡（太阳）公转的时候，大球（地球）本身不仅是自转的，太阳、月球也都同时自转。在圆周的外围，又装有一条和太阳地球中心一样高的扁的铁圈，这铁圈是用来代表黄道的。在黄道上面，注有四季节气，还有“黄道十二宫”的名字和位置。
    据张俊德说，这个“月地运行仪”目前可以说明十几个天文现象。第一，是月球和地球在宇宙中绕日运行的关系。他说，当我们转动手拐的时候，地球便以反时针方向绕太阳转动（公转），同时以同方向自转。公转一周，自转三百六十五次多。自转一周的时间叫做一“日”，公转一周的时间叫做一
    “年”，所以一年有三百六十五又差不多四分之一日。月球绕地球转一周需要二十七天多，这样一段时间叫做一个“恒星月”。第二，是恒星月和朔望月的差别。他说，我们日常所讲的“月”并不是“恒星月”，而是“阳历月”或者“夏历月”。“阳历月”的平均长度差不多三十天半。“夏历月”也叫“朔望月”，就是满月和满月相隔的时间，有二十九天半之长。“恒星月”是以恒星为标准。比方说，以金牛座的一个星为标准，地球、月球和金牛座的一个星成一直线。月球绕地球转了一周之后，地球、月球和金牛座的一个星又成一直线，相隔的时间就是一个“恒星月”。“朔望月”是以太阳为标准。月球和太阳在地球相对的两边时，地球上的人就看到满月。月球公转，地球也在公转，因为它们都向同一方向运转，所以满月到满月的时间，比
    一个“恒星月”长两天多。第三，是“恒星日”和“太阳日”的差别。他说，地球自转一周所需要的时间叫做“恒星日”，地球上的某一点从正午到正午所需要的时间叫做“太阳日”。地球一面在自转，一面在公转，转的方向相同，所以太阳日比恒星日长一点点（约四分钟）。第四，是昼夜的成因。他说，地球是球形，所以在任何时候，太阳光只能照射在地球表面的一半上面。被照射的一面是白天，背日的一面便在黑夜。地球不停地自转，所以昼夜不停地循环。地面上两极附近半年是白天，半年是黑夜。第五，是地球自转轴和公转轴不平行。他说，这一点在仪器上面表现得很清楚。地球的自转轴不和黄道面成垂直，而成六十六度半的角度。也就是说地球的赤道和黄道以二十三度半的角度相交，这个角就是所谓“黄赤交角”。第六，是四季变化的原因。他说，“黄赤交角”是四季变化的主要原因。地球的自转轴的方向在几百年内几乎不变，所以一年内在温带的地方，有时候太阳光直射，有时候太阳光斜射。在夏至时，太阳光直射在北回归线上，北温带地方的黑夜短，白天长，太阳光也强，所以气候炎热。冬季的情形则正相反，春秋二季太阳光直射在地球的中间（赤道），温带地方的太阳光不像夏季的那样直，又没有冬季的那样斜，所以不热也不冷。昼夜也相等。第七，是地球绕日运行时的近日点和远日点。他说，地球绕太阳运行的轨道是椭圆形，椭圆形总有两个圆心（焦点），太阳在一个圆心上，所以地球有时候离太阳远，有时候离太阳近。最远的一点叫“远日点”，最近的一点叫“近日点”。夏至以后十日，地球在远日点上；冬至以后十日，地球在近日点上。由此证明，我们温带地方的冷热变化，主要是由于太阳光直射和斜射而产生的。第八，是月亮圆缺的原因。他说，月球自己不发光，只是把照射在它表面的太阳光反射到我们眼睛里。月球不停地绕地球转，所以它受光的那半面，有时全向着我们，有时只向着我们一部分，有时全背着我们。这就是月亮圆缺的道理。第九，是月球的自转。他说，月球总是以几乎同一面对着我们；这表示月球也在自转。自转一周所用的时间和公转一周相等。假使月球不自转，它绕地球转一周的时间内我们应当轮流看到它表面的各部分，而不应当总是看到同一部分。这个仪器的构造也能充分地说明这一点。第十，是日月交蚀的原因。他说，当月球走到太阳和地球中间，日、月、地成为一条直线的时候，便发生日蚀的现象。月球比太阳小得多，所以每次日蚀发生，只在地球上一小部分的地方看得见。当月球走到地球的外面，地球在日月之间，日、地、月成为一条直线的时候，太阳光被地球挡住，射不到月球，地球表面背着太阳的一半便看到月蚀现象。日蚀总在月朔（夏历初一）发生；月蚀总在满月（夏历十五）时发生。第十一，是月球的轨道不在黄道面上。他说，月球轨道（白道）和黄道面成一个五度八分交角，这叫做“黄白交角”。正因为有这个“黄白交角”，所以才不至于每月都有日月蚀发生。第十二，是月亮出没方向变动的道理。他说，因为有“黄赤交角”和“黄白交角”的存在，月亮每天上升时在地平线上的地位常在变更。冬天月亮从东北方上升，夏天则从东南方上升。冬夜里月亮在地平线上的时间长，夏夜里短；所以冬天月光多，夏天月光少。这个现象，现在不用再“摸脑袋”了，从这个仪器上会看得十分清楚的。第十三，是月球公转轨道（白道）的形状。他说，月球一方面是绕着地球运行，同时绕着太阳作连环的形状运行。第十四，夏历的月有二十九日和三十日的不同，以及三年闰一月、五年闰两月的原因，在这个仪器上也可以看得清楚。他说，夏历的月是按月球的位相计算，以从新月到新月为一月，因为从新月到新月需时约二十九日半，为了计算方便，半日前后移动，所以月有二十九日和三十日之别。一月是二十九日半，十二月共计三百五十四日，和地球实际绕太阳一周所需时间约三百六十五又四分之一日差十一日多。三年要差三十三日，五年要差五十五日，所以只有三年闰一月，五年闰两月才可以不差。第十五，太阳本是恒星，但是我们从地球上看太阳时，会觉得太阳在移动（实际上是地球在运行）。在一年当中，这个在地球上看来像是太阳在天空移动的路线，就是所谓黄道。这一点，在这个仪器上也能看得很清楚。第十六，太阳的自转。他说，不只是地球和月球总在自转，太阳也总是在自转的。这是在去年开过中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会回去以后改进的。原来，在这仪器上的太阳是还不能自转的。
    接着，张俊德又给我看了他继这个“月地运行仪”而后制造的一个“风雨实验器”。他很谦逊地说：“这个仪器还十分简单，目前他只能说明风雨的成因和氧的助燃。不过它用钱不多，只要用六、七万元就可以制造一个。我想如果把它拿到乡下去，可以叫老乡们知道：世界上是并没有所谓风婆和雨神的。这对破除迷信和普及天文知识将有很大作用。”
    最后他告诉记者：“我这次到南京去学习，首先，要努力完成组织上交给我的学习任务。我过去在旧社会里受的刺激多，脑子出了毛病，记忆太不好，可能不是个聪明的学生，但我要把紫金山天文台的那些学者和专家们都看做是我的老师。我知道的太少了，我一定用认真的态度向他们学习。其次我还想改进这个仪器。一方面普及它，使成本降低，要每一个乡村小学都有力量购置一架；另一方面提高它，使它为我们说明天文学上的更多问题。但这决不是我一个人可以做得到的，必须依靠群众的力量！”
