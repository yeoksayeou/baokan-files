    Children – Treasures of the World
    Song Qingling
    The delegates from various countries who attended the Vienna Conference for the Protection of Children have returned to their homelands. This imbues the 1952 International Children's Day with extraordinary significance. The delegates from Vienna brought back assurances of saving children, along with a resolute and unified will to strive for peace and improve lives in every corner of the world. This assurance must be realized as much as possible in daily life, but will be given special importance on this year's June 1st.

    China, as well as other people's countries, will undoubtedly fulfill this responsibility to children satisfactorily. According to our fundamental laws, our countless children are born with the guarantee of life and happiness, with opportunities for development in all aspects, and the right to develop their intelligence and cultivate their character. When we say that children are the treasures of mankind, we are not just saying it. We are turning this belief into action. We have opened more nurseries and sanatoriums, and are constantly expanding health and education facilities; we are realizing our belief with a sound moral atmosphere. We will continue to develop in these directions, which is completely certain.

    Today, the most urgent and important question is whether the aforementioned guarantee is accepted by other countries. The final resolution of the Vienna Conference contains this important passage: "People of the world, let us strengthen our brotherly cooperation to save our children!" But today, in several important countries, the thoughts and actions of their leaders are devoid of friendliness. Their concern for children and for civilization itself is far less than their interest in excessive profits. Many people in these countries, deceived and blinded by their leaders, still find it difficult to recognize the fundamental issues facing today's world that determine whether we can achieve peace. They are deceived into thinking that there are differences between them and us, and the people's countries. Even from our perspective, we cannot imagine that our pursuit of world peace and engagement in peaceful construction would cause them any harm. But the mention of protecting children immediately dissolves these so-called differences. As the general report of the Vienna Conference pointed out: "We have discovered a bridge that can bridge differences in environment, race, religion, and political parties. This bridge is children – our children." When the demand to "save children" is raised, it creates a "miracle of mutual understanding." This demand has indeed proven to be a common ground. On this, women and women, men and men, can gain understanding and acceptance; on this, we can obtain a foothold for the world's pursuit of peace. Therefore, in this crucial year of 1952, as we celebrate International Children's Day, I cannot help but think of the growing sense of justice in the world for protecting children, and how this sense of justice will affect certain countries, in which children still endure terrible harm and poverty, and intellectual and moral poverty that is as poor as their material lives. Even in their most affluent countries, this is the case. Today, in China and other people's countries, we express overflowing love and supreme pride to our children. I firmly believe that we have a great deal of love that can be distributed to children living in suffering far away; in our dedication to the struggle for peace, we can reach out to parents in all countries, because I am certain that all people in the world are pursuing the same goal – to enable our children to enjoy peace and a full life. Thanks to the support of the Vienna Conference, we have a greater possibility to gain worldwide trust and unity, just as our children symbolize.

    儿童——世界之宝
    宋庆龄
    参加维也纳保卫儿童会议的各国代表都已回到他们的本国去了。这赋与一九五二年的国际儿童节一种不平常的意义。从维也纳代表们带回去了拯救儿童的保证，与在世界每一个角落里争取和平、改善生活的坚决一致的意志。这个保证是须在日常生活中尽一切可能实现的，但在今年的六月一日将得到特别重视。
    中国以及其他人民国家，毫无疑问，将圆满完成这种对儿童的责任。根据我们的基本法律，我们千千万万的儿童，生来就获得了生命和幸福的保障，有从各方面发展的机会，以及发展智力和培养品德的权利。我们说儿童是人类的至宝，这决不是说说就算了的。我们正把这种信念化为行动，我们开办了更多托儿所和保养院，并不断地在扩充卫生和教育设施；用健全的道德风气，来实现我们的信念。我们将继续从这些方向发展，这是完全可以肯定的。
    在今天说来，最为迫切重要的问题是：上述保证是否为其他国家所接受。维也纳会议的最后决议中，有这样一段重要的话：“全世界的人民，让我们加强我们兄弟般的合作来拯救我们的儿童吧！”可是今天，在几个重要国家中，它们的领袖的思想与行动，毫无友好可言。他们对儿童以及对文明本身的关怀，比起他们对于超额利润的兴趣，真是微乎其微。这些国家的许多人民，在他们领袖的欺骗蒙蔽下，现在还不容易认识到面对今日世界的几个足以决定我们是否可以获得和平的基本问题。他们受到欺骗，以为他们和我们，和人民国家之间，有什么分歧。即使从我们方面来说，我们实无法想像我们追求世界的安宁，从事和平建设，对他们会有任何损害。但一提及保卫儿童问题，这些所谓分歧，就立即消散了。正如维也纳会议的总报告所指出：“我们已发现了一座桥梁，可以沟通环境、种族、宗教和政党方面的分歧。这座桥梁就是儿童——我们的儿童。”当“拯救儿童”的要求提出时，就造成了“相互谅解的奇迹”。这个要求已经确实证明是一个共同基础。在这上面，妇女和妇女间、男人与男人间，可以获得谅解，相互接受，在这上面，我们可以得到全世界追求和平的立足点。因此，在一九五二年这一紧要年头，当我们庆祝国际儿童节的时候，我不能不想到世界上对保卫儿童日益高涨的正义感，以及这种正义感会如何影响某一些国家，在这些国家中，儿童仍忍受着可怕的危害与贫乏，与物质生活同样贫穷的知识贫穷和道德贫穷。即便在它们那一些最富裕的国家中，也是如此。今天，在中国和其他人民国家中，我们向我们的儿童表示了洋溢的爱和无上的骄傲。我深信：我们有大量的爱，可以分散给远方那些仍在苦痛中生活的儿童；在我们献身于争取和平的斗争中，我们可以向各个国家的父母伸手，因我确信世界上所有人民都在追求同一个目标——使我们的儿童能享受和平与丰满的生活。由于维也纳会议的支援，我们已有更大的可能来获得全世界的信任与团结，正如我们的儿童所象征着的。
