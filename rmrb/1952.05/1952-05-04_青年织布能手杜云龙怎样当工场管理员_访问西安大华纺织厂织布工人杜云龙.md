    How the Young Weaving Expert Du Yunlong Became a Workshop Administrator
    – An Interview with Du Yunlong, a Weaver at the Xi’an Dahua Textile Factory
    Du Yunlong, a weaving expert at the Xi'an Dahua Textile Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, is a member of the Communist Youth League and only twenty-three years old this year. Since the liberation of Xi'an, he has been demonstrating his ability and intelligence. The quantity of cloth he weaves is consistently the highest in the entire factory. After reading about the Hao Jianxiu work method in the newspaper last September, he more humbly studied its basic spirit and characteristics and applied it to his own weaving work, making his work method more rational. In several evaluations, he was awarded the honorary title of "First-Class Model Worker." Last October 1st, he was elected by the workers as the administrator of the weaving workshop.
    He said that he had long wanted to visit Beijing to see Chairman Mao and the capital of New China. His wish has finally come true. On the afternoon of April 25th, Xi Zhichao, the chairman of the factory's trade union, told him that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had invited him to Beijing to attend the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations. He was so happy that he couldn't sleep for several days, thinking about the hard times of the past, the status of the working class today, and the work he still needs to do.
    I interviewed him the day after he arrived in Beijing.
    When I asked him how he was doing in his leadership role, he said modestly:
    "My ability is very low, and leading the entire cloth workshop is a new job for me, so I can't talk about any achievements yet. I need to work hard in the future." However, after only a very brief conversation, I felt that he was a very good leader. He has only been in a leadership position for a little over half a year, and he already understands that to do a good job as a leader, he must constantly improve the political awareness of his staff and care about their lives.
    Some of the young workers in the weft yarn section of the weaving workshop used to quarrel and not work very well because the leading cadres' education for them was too poor. "How to change their work attitude?" Du Yunlong often thought after he took over the leadership of the cloth workshop. Therefore, starting from the beginning of March, Du Yunlong squeezed out half an hour every day to read the newspaper to the workers and vividly introduced them to the work attitude of good workers, as well as the heroic stories of the volunteer army. Sure enough, it didn't take long for the work attitude of these young workers to normalize. Recently, since everyone launched a labor competition, they have also proposed guarantees to complete production tasks on time and do a good job in cleaning. The atmosphere of political study has become strong, and they often read the newspapers themselves. Several young workers are now requesting to join the Communist Youth League.
    In his conversation, he was filled with concern for the lives of the workers. He lives closely with everyone. The weaving worker Wang Maode was relatively backward before the "Three-Anti" campaign, and often did not go to meetings or study. Not long ago, he developed an eye disease and was hospitalized. Du Yunlong and Guo Xingjie, the group leader Xu Yupu, wrote him cordial letters of sympathy and bought him biscuits. Wang Maode deeply felt the care of the leading cadres for him; even while he was still sick, he asked a nurse to write a reply for him: "You care about me so much, I must work hard in production when I get back." Less than half a month after he recovered and returned to work, he achieved an excellent record of producing 46.7 yards of cloth per loom in ten hours.
    Under the leadership of Du Yunlong, and after being educated by the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, the appearance of the weaving workshop of the Dahua Yarn Factory has completely changed. The workers' production enthusiasm is very high, and all the workers have devoted themselves to the labor competition movement. After the workers of Section 2 challenged the workers of Section 3, the output per loom in ten hours exceeded 45 yards (one of the conditions of the competition); three days later, Section 4 responded to the challenge with a score of 46 yards. Workers in other workshops also launched competitions one after another. Before the competition, the average output per loom in ten hours was 43.4 yards, and the average yarn production per spindle was 0.472 pounds. After April 15th, the cloth output reached an average of 45.045 yards per loom in ten hours, and the average yarn production per spindle was 0.512 pounds, and the rate of second-grade cloth was reduced from 3% to 1.7%.

    青年织布能手杜云龙怎样当工场管理员
    ——访问西安大华纺织厂织布工人杜云龙
    西安公私合营大华纺织厂的织布能手——杜云龙，是个青年团员，今年才二十三岁。自从西安解放后，他便发挥了他的能力和智慧。他织的布的产量经常占全厂的第一位。去年九月，他从报纸上看到郝建秀工作法后，更虚心地学习它的基本精神和特点，运用到自己的织布工作中，使自己的工作法更趋向合理。在几次评选中，他得到了“甲等劳动模范”的光荣称号。去年十月一日，他被职工推选为织布场的管理员。
    他说，他很早就想到北京来看毛主席和新中国的首都。他的愿望终于实现了。四月二十五日下午，厂工会主席郗志超告诉他：全国总工会邀他到北京参加“五一”劳动节观礼。他乐得好几天没睡好觉，想着过去的苦难日子，想着今天工人阶级的地位，更想着自己要做的工作。
    在他来到北京的第二天，我访问了他。
    当我问起他怎样做领导工作时，他谦虚地说：
    “我能力很低，领导整个布场又是个新工作，还谈不到什么成绩。今后需要好好努力才行。”但是，仅经过很简短的谈话，我便感到他是一个很好的领导工作者。他负担领导工作只有半年多的时光，已懂得了要做好领导工作，必须不断地提高职工的政治觉悟，关心职工的生活。
    织布场纬纱间有些年青工人，过去因为领导干部对他们的教育太差，时常吵吵闹闹，不很好地干活。“怎样改变他们的劳动态度呢？”杜云龙担任了布场的领导工作后，常常这样想。因而，自三月初开始，杜云龙便每天挤出半点钟时间读报给工人听，并生动地向他们介绍好工人的劳动态度，以及志愿军英勇作战的故事。果然，没有多少时候，这伙年青工人的劳动态度正常起来了。最近，自大家发动劳动竞赛以后，他们也提出了要按时完成生产任务和做好清洁工作的保证。政治学习的空气浓厚了，他们时常自己拿着报看。有好几个青年工人，都正在要求加入青年团。
    在他的谈话中，洋溢着对职工生活的关怀。他密切地和大家生活在一起。织布工人王茂德在“三反”前是比较落后的，常不去开会、学习。不久前，他两眼长了病，住到医院里去。杜云龙和郭兴杰、组长许玉璞，便亲切地给他写慰问信，还买饼干送给他。王茂德深深感到领导干部对他的爱护；还在病中，他就叫护士代他写了一封回信：“你们对我这样关心，回去后一定要好好生产。”病好后，他上班不到半个月，便创出每台布机十小时产布四十六点七码的优良成绩。
    在杜云龙的领导下，职工经过了“三反”“五反”斗争的教育，把大华纱厂织布场的面貌完全改变了。职工的生产情绪非常高，全体职工都已投入劳动竞赛运动。二段工人向三段工人挑战后，每台布机十小时的产量便超过了四十五码（竞赛的条件之一）；过三天，四段又以四十六码的成绩向二段来应战。其他车间职工，也随着先后发起竞赛。竞赛以前，每台布机十小时平均产布为四十三点四码，每锭平均产纱零点四七二磅。到四月十五日以后，布的产量达到每台布机十小时平均产布四十五点零四五码，每个锭子平均产纱零点五一二磅，次布率由百分之三降低到百分之一点七。  （林悦）（附图片）
