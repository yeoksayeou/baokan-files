Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The heinous crimes of the American imperialists in the Geje Island prisoner-of-war camp have aroused unparalleled anger among the people of European countries.

    The Polish newspaper "Warsaw Life" said: The American ruling group organized a large-scale massacre, which disgraced their reputation and exposed them as insidious slanderers. The Geje Island incident once again proves that the American imperialists are unwilling to see a successful conclusion to the Panmunjom negotiations, and they are deliberately prolonging the Korean War.

    Czechoslovak Radio, in commenting on the news of the bloody incident in the American prisoner-of-war camp on Geje Island, pointed out: The American imperialists' atrocities against prisoners of war have surpassed those of the Hitler bandits. Upon hearing of the atrocities of the American interventionists in Korea, no honest person can fail to feel immense indignation and hatred towards those criminals; no peace-loving person can fail to feel deep admiration, love, and sympathy for the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are fighting for freedom and independence. "Red Rights" published an editorial on the 21st denouncing the American aggressors' atrocities in Korea. The newspaper wrote: Millions of people in various countries are increasingly firmly opposing the crimes of the American army and supporting the heroic Korean people. Under the general title "All Honest People Express Anger at American War Criminals," the newspaper published letters from workers in various parts of Czechoslovakia. These letters unanimously protested the American aggressors' heinous atrocities in Korea. Svoboda, a famous Czechoslovak metal high-speed cutting technician and National Prize winner, wrote: We most resolutely protest the brutal actions taken by American agents against prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. We protest the crime of American bandits using prisoners of war to experiment with bacteriological weapons. We condemn the US military's use of violence against prisoners of war and the mass slaughter of prisoners of war. "Red Rights" wrote: A wave of indignation and protest against the heinous crime of the US military deliberately massacring unarmed prisoners of war in the Geje Island prisoner-of-war camp has swept across Czechoslovakia.

    Hungarian public opinion is deeply indignant at the atrocities committed by American warmongers on Geje Island. The weekly "Independent Hungary" published an editorial entitled "The Exposed Lies," saying: Undoubtedly, what happened in the Geje Island prisoner-of-war camp completely exposed all the propaganda made by the American military leadership regarding the issue of prisoners of war. "Free People" newspaper published an article by its correspondent in Korea, Miray, exposing the atrocities of the American imperialists in mistreating prisoners of war. Miray said: For months, various representatives have frequently visited and inspected the Geje Island prisoner-of-war camp, including Otto Lehner, a Swiss representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other representatives of the committee. Otto Lehner said that "everything is fine" on Geje Island. Everyone knows that Lehner used to be the representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Berlin and served as a member of the investigation team of the Theresienstadt Nazi concentration camp. At that time, he assured public opinion that "the situation was good" in Hitler's death camps... Now we understand what Otto Lehner meant when he said that "the situation was good" in Hitler and American concentration camps. Miray wrote in conclusion: "The Geje Island incident has already judged the American so-called 'voluntary repatriation' policy, and no appeal can be made against this judgment."

    The entire working people of the Romanian People's Republic were greatly indignant upon learning of the atrocities committed by the American aggressors in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geje Island. In the afternoon of the 20th, workers in many enterprises in Bucharest held impassioned protest meetings, accusing the American interventionists of heinous and illegal acts, and expressing support for the struggle of the heroic Korean people. Employees of the "Dinamo" factory, the "Vulcan" factory, and the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" ready-made clothing factory in Bucharest unanimously passed protest telegrams to the United Nations.

    A protest rally was held at the Iasi railway station depot on the 21st, attended by one thousand workers, engineers, and staff. Foreman Ghis of the Stirgel Rosu factory in Stalin City represented the workers and technicians in expressing their hatred, demanding that the imperialist aggression against Korea be stopped, and demanding that all criminals who violate humanity be severely punished.

    The Romanian and Hungarian workers of the "Ianos Herbak" factory unanimously condemned the new lawless crimes of the American imperialists, and emphasized that these despicable actions cannot stop the heroic struggle of the Korean people for liberation. Protest rallies were also held in many other enterprises in the city and province of Bucharest, and protest telegrams were sent to the United Nations.

    The Romanian branch of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers sent a telegram to the United Nations, protesting the atrocities and war crimes of the American aggressors. The telegram said: The American military authorities completely disregard all international legal standards and war regulations. The United States has turned Geje Island into a torture chamber to kill Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The telegram concluded: The conscience of mankind demands that all honest citizens in the world intensify their struggle to stop the massacre, to ensure respect for human rights, and to strive for peace. "Free Romania" newspaper, in commenting on the bloody events in the Geje Island prisoner-of-war camp, said: This barbaric suppression of prisoners of war once again exposes the beastly nature of the American imperialist criminals. In order to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have used new and vicious methods of warfare. The bloody events of Geje Island are the most powerful evidence to accuse American war criminals—the spreaders of plague and cholera germs, and the American imperialists—the most ferocious enemies of mankind.

    Bulgarian public opinion and newspapers continue to express indignation at the bloody crimes of American imperialism on Geje Island. "News Evening Post" wrote: Now the whole world knows about America's heinous crimes. Honest people are extremely angry at such barbaric acts of American imperialism. General Colson's confession exposed the true situation of the prisoners of war and proved even more clearly why the Korean armistice negotiations have been so delayed—because American imperialism is妄想 hoping to legalize the enslavement of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and does not intend to send them home. Stoyanov, a member of the World Peace Council and President of the Academy of Sciences, wrote: Although the whole world knows that the atrocities committed by the United States in Korea are unprecedented, the incidents of American Generals Dodd and Colson once again exposed the true faces of the rulers and generals in Washington. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have given the US military command a crisp slap in the face, and its voice has resounded throughout the world. "Worker's Affairs" newspaper published a statement by Socialist Labor Hero Dunka Piranetova. She said: "When I heard about the atrocities committed by the American cannibals against the unarmed prisoners of war on Geje Island, I felt immense anger. In order to subdue the Korean people, the American imperialists have committed heinous crimes against prisoners of war."

    The Dutch Communist Party's organ "Truth" commented on the news of the American aggressors' mistreatment of our captured personnel on Geje Island, saying: The captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides demanded that prisoners of war be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. The US side completely ignored this international convention that provides certain guarantees for prisoners of war. The US side used torture in an attempt to force prisoners of war to sign statements indicating that they did not want to return to North Korea or China. In the process of taking terrorist measures against prisoners of war, the US side also had Chiang Kai-shek's agents, who had received specialized training in killing, work for them. But despite using all kinds of barbaric methods, this conspiracy did not succeed. Korean prisoners of war have always been looking for opportunities to attract the world's attention. They detained an American general. Newspapers all over the world commented on this incident. The US side initially kept the prisoners of war's demands secret, but later had to admit that the prisoners of war demanded humane treatment. In this way, the true face of the American imperialists was exposed: they are precisely the enemies of all mankind. The whole world has begun to understand more and more clearly how terrible the crimes committed by the United States in Korea are.

    反对美国侵略者屠杀我被俘人员的罪行
    欧洲各国人民愤怒表示抗议
    【新华社二十三日讯】美帝国主义者在巨济岛战俘营中的滔天罪行，引起了欧洲各国人民的无比愤怒。
    波兰报纸“华沙生活”说：美国统治集团组织了大规模屠杀而使他们的名誉扫地，而且暴露出他们是阴险的诽谤者。巨济岛事件再一次证明：美帝国主义者不愿意板门店谈判获得成功的结束，他们故意拖延朝鲜战争。
    捷克斯洛伐克电台在评论巨济岛美国战俘营中血腥事件的消息时指出：美国帝国主义者虐待战俘的暴行已超过了希特勒匪徒。在听到美国干涉者在朝鲜的暴行时，没有一个正直的人不对那些罪犯们感到无比的愤慨和痛恨；没有一个爱好和平的人不对为自由与独立而战的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军感到深切的钦佩、爱戴和同情。“红色权利报”在二十一日发表社论斥责美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行。该报写道：世界各国千百万群众越来越坚决地反对美军的罪行，声援英雄的朝鲜人民。该报在“一切正直的人对美国战犯表示愤怒”的总标题下登载了捷克斯洛伐克各地劳动者的来信。这些信件同声抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天暴行。捷克斯洛伐克有名的金属高速切削技师、国家奖金得奖人斯沃波达写道：我们最坚决地抗议美国特务对朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的俘虏采取的残暴行动。我们抗议美国匪徒拿战俘试验细菌武器的罪行。我们声讨美军对战俘使用暴力与大批屠杀战俘的行为。“红色权利报”写道：对侵朝美军蓄意屠杀巨济岛战俘营手无寸铁的战俘的滔天罪行表示愤慨与抗议的浪潮，已经汹涌澎湃地在捷克斯洛伐克全国展开了。
    匈牙利舆论界对美国黩武主义者在巨济岛上所作的暴行深表愤慨。“独立匈牙利”周刊以“被揭穿了的谎言”为题发表社论说：无疑的，巨济岛战俘营中所发生的事情，把美国军事领导机关在战俘问题上所作的全部宣传拆穿无遗了。“自由人民”报刊载该报驻朝鲜记者米赖依揭露美帝国主义虐待战俘兽行的文章。米赖依说：数月以来，经常有各式各样的代表来巨济岛战俘营访问和巡视，其中包括红十字国际委员会代表瑞士人奥图·莱纳以及该会的其他代表等人。奥图·莱纳说，巨济岛上“一切都好。”大家知道，莱纳曾任红十字国际委员会驻柏林代表，并且担任过特拉辛法西斯集中营调查团的团员。那时，他曾向舆论界保证说，希特勒死亡营中“情况良好”。……现在我们明白，奥图·莱纳说希特勒和美国集中营“情况良好”是什么意思了。米赖依在结语中写道：“巨济岛事件对美国所谓
    ‘自愿遣返’政策已经作了判决，对这种判决是无法提出上诉的。”
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的全体劳动人民得悉美国侵略者在巨济岛上的战俘营中所犯的暴行后，莫不感到极大的愤慨。布加勒斯特的许多企业的劳动人民在二十日下午纷纷举行情绪激昂的抗议集会，指责美国干涉者的罪大恶极的非法行为，并对英勇的朝鲜人民的斗争表示声援，布加勒斯特的“狄纳莫”工厂、“火神”工厂和“乔治乌—德治”现成服装工厂的职工都一致通过了致联合国的抗议电。
    雅西火车站停车间在二十一日举行了一个抗议大会，参加者有一千名工人、工程师和职员。在斯大林城的斯提格尔罗舒工厂的领班工人吉斯，代表工人和技术人员表示了他们的憎恨，要求制止帝国主义侵略朝鲜，并要求严惩一切违背人道的罪犯。
    “伊安诺斯·赫尔伯克”工厂的罗马尼亚和匈牙利劳动人民一致斥责美帝国主义者的无法无天的新罪行，并强调说：这种可憎的行动并不能够阻止朝鲜人民争取解放的英勇斗争。在布加勒斯特城和省的许多其他企业中也举行了抗议大会，并向联合国发出了抗议的电报。
    国际民主法律工作者协会罗马尼亚分会致电联合国，抗议美国侵略者的暴行和战争罪行。电文说：美国军事当局完全不顾一切国际法的标准和战争法规。美国把巨济岛变成了一个酷刑室，来残杀朝中战俘。电文最后说：人类的良知要求所有世界各国的诚实公民为制止屠杀、为使人权得到尊重、为争取和平而加紧斗争。“自由罗马尼亚报”在评论巨济岛战俘营的血腥事件时说：这种对战俘的野蛮镇压，再一次揭露了美帝国主义罪犯的兽性。美国侵略者为了想破坏朝鲜停战谈判，使用了新的恶毒的战争方法。巨济岛的血腥事件是控告美国战犯——鼠疫和霍乱病菌的撒布者、控告美帝国主义者——人类最凶恶的敌人的最有力的证据。
    保加利亚舆论界和报纸对于美帝国主义在巨济岛上的血腥罪行继续表示愤慨。“新闻晚报”写道：现在全世界都知道了美国的滔天罪行。正直的人们对于美帝国主义的这种野蛮行径都感到万分愤怒。柯尔生将军的招供把战俘的真正情况暴露无遗，并且更加清楚地证明了为什么朝鲜停战谈判会这样拖延不决——那是因为美帝国主义妄想使得奴役朝中战俘的举动成为合法，而且不打算遣送他们回家。世界和平理事会理事、科学院院长斯图扬诺夫写道：虽然整个世界都知道美国在朝鲜的暴行是空前未有的，但是美国将军杜德和柯尔生的事件，再一次暴露了华盛顿统治者和将军们的真面目。朝中战俘已给了美军司令部一记清脆的耳光，它的声音响彻了全世界。“工人事业报”登载了社会主义劳动英雄顿卡·彼拉涅托娃的声明。她说：“当我听到美国吃人生番对巨济岛上的手无寸铁的战俘所施的暴行时，我感到无比的愤怒。为了要使朝鲜人民屈服，美帝国主义者对战俘犯下了滔天的罪行。”
    荷兰共产党机关报“真理报”就美国侵略者在巨济岛上虐待我方被俘人员的消息发表评论称：朝中方面被俘人员要求按照日内瓦公约对待战俘。美方完全不理会这个给战俘以一定保障的国际规约。美方施用酷刑，企图借此强迫战俘签名表示不希望回北朝鲜或中国。美方在对战俘采取恐怖手段的过程中，还要受过专门杀人训练的蒋介石的特务为他们效劳。但是尽管用尽一切野蛮手段，这种阴谋仍未得逞。朝鲜战俘始终在找机会吸引全世界的注意。他们扣留了一个美国将军。全世界的报纸都对这件事加以评论。美方最初秘不透露战俘的要求，后来不得不承认战俘要求受到人道的待遇。这样一来，美帝国主义者的真面目就暴露无遗：他们正是全人类的敌人。全世界已开始日益清楚地了解美国在朝鲜犯了多么可怕的罪行。
