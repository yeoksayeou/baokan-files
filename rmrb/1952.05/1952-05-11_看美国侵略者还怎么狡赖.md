As the saying goes, "A thief has a guilty conscience." Since the American aggressors are thieves, they will certainly quibble and deny launching bacteriological warfare. The extremely cruel must also be extremely cunning; this is the nature of aggressors.

The confessions of Enuk and Quinn confirm how the American imperialist aggressors launched bacteriological warfare cruelly and secretively, and also confirm how the aggressors are essentially cunning and shameless, refusing to admit their guilt to the death. Comparing the aggressors to mosquitoes and flies, the aggressors are even more hateful and detestable. Although mosquitoes and flies are detestable, they still don't lie and quibble.

What Enuk and Quinn said is consistent with what we have investigated. The upright Chinese and Korean people will neither speak based on hearsay nor abandon the responsibility of denouncing the heinous crimes of the bacteriological warfare criminals.

With their confessions, let's see how the aggressors can still quibble! Even if they continue to quibble, it will only prove that they are even more hateful and detestable and will be subject to even more severe judgment by the people of the world. So be it: let's eliminate the aggressors, who are even more hateful than mosquitoes and flies, in the same way we eliminate mosquitoes and flies!

    看美国侵略者还怎么狡赖
    老舍
    俗语说得好：“作贼的胆虚”。美国侵略者既是贼盗，当然会狡赖，不承认发动了细菌战。残暴无比的也必狡猾无比，这是侵略者的本质。
    伊纳克和奎恩的供词证实了美帝侵略者怎样残暴地诡秘地发动了细菌战，也证实了侵略者怎样本质地狡猾无耻，死不认罪。拿侵略者和蚊子苍蝇比较起来，侵略者更可恨可憎，蚊子苍蝇虽然可憎，却还不会扯谎狡赖。
    伊纳克和奎恩所说的正和我们所调查的相符合，堂堂的中朝人民既不会望风捕影地说话，也不会放弃声讨细菌战犯们万恶罪行的责任。
    有了他们二人的供词，看侵略者还怎么再狡赖！即使还再狡赖，也不过证明他们更可恨可憎，会受到世界人民更严厉的裁判。就是这样吧：我们怎么消灭蚊子苍蝇，便怎么消灭比蚊子苍蝇更可憎恨的侵略者吧！
