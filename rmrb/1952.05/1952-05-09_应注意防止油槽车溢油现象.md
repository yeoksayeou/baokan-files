    Should Pay Attention to Prevent Oil Tanker Overflow
    To the Editor: At 9:20 AM on April 26th, I saw twenty-seven oil tankers arrive at Xuzhou Station. Because of the heat, the oil expanded, and the safety valves on nineteen of the tankers were overflowing with oil, like rain. The next day, I saw another train of oil tankers leaking oil. This not only wastes national property but also easily causes fires, which is very dangerous. Now that the weather is getting warmer, I suggest that the relevant departments across the country that use oil tankers pay attention to the amount of oil loaded. The railway transportation departments should also strengthen inspections and pay attention to the condition of oil tankers during operation, so as to avoid unnecessary losses.

    应注意防止油槽车溢油现象
    编辑同志：四月二十六日九点二十分，我看见有二十七辆油槽车到达徐州车站。因天热油涨，有十九辆车上部的安全阀向外溢油，势如下雨。第二天我又看见有一列油槽车发生漏油现象。这不但浪费了国家财产，更易引起火灾，是非常危险的。现在天气热起来了，我建议全国各地使用油槽车的有关部门，注意装油量。铁道运输部门也应加强检查，留意油槽车在运行中的情况，以免除不应有的损失。    周艺
