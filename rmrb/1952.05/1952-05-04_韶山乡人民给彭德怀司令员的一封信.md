    A Letter from the People of Shaoshan Township to Commander Peng Dehuai
    Respected Commander Peng Dehuai:
    We feel very honored and excited that the representatives sent back by the Volunteer Army visit Shaoshan Township, the hometown of Chairman Mao, every time. From the representatives' reports, we have learned more about the heroic struggles of the Volunteer Army. Every great victory of the Volunteer Army has encouraged our production enthusiasm. Last year, we launched a patriotic production increase movement, and the entire township increased rice production by 214,800 jin. We donated 32,000 jin of rice to purchase airplanes and cannons. Since November last year, we have responded to Chairman Mao's call and launched a production increase and frugality campaign. Every household has made a patriotic production increase and frugality plan. In more than three months, the entire township earned more than 1,031,000 jin of grain from sideline production, exceeding the original plan by more than double. During the Spring Festival, the entire township saved more than 100 million yuan. We have learned from the experiences of high-yield models such as Li Chenggui and Zeng Boyan, and we are determined to increase the yield per unit area. Everyone is confident of increasing production by 30% on the basis of last year. The entire township has accumulated about 420,000 dan of manure, and plans to apply 50 to 60 dan of manure per mu of land. The entire township has repaired 127 ponds, 20 dams, 6 canals, and 2 wells, which can ensure 60 days without drought. We attach great importance to preferential treatment work. In addition to doing more than 11,000 days of plowing on behalf of the families of martyrs and soldiers, we also helped them gather a lot of firewood.
    Respected Commander Peng Dehuai! The towering crime of American imperialism spreading bacteria in Korea and our country has aroused even greater anger and hatred in us. Please tell all the Volunteer Army comrades: We are determined to respond to all the government's calls with practical actions, continue to strengthen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, support you and the Korean People's Army, and completely defeat all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism.
    Salute with lofty revolutionary respect
    All the people of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan

    韶山乡人民给彭德怀司令员的一封信
    敬爱的彭德怀司令员：
    志愿军每次派回的代表，都到毛主席的故乡——韶山乡来访问，我们感到非常光荣和兴奋。从代表们的报告里，我们更多地知道了志愿军英勇斗争的情形。志愿军的每一个伟大胜利，都鼓舞了我们的生产情绪。去年，我们开展了爱国增产运动，全乡增产了二十一万四千八百斤稻谷。我们捐献了三万二千斤稻谷购买飞机大炮。去年十一月起，我们响应毛主席的号召，开展了增产节约运动。家家户户订了爱国增产节约计划。在三个多月里，全乡从副业生产中收入了一百零三万一千多斤谷，超过原计划一倍多。春节时全乡节省了一亿多元。我们已经学习了李承桂、曾伯炎等丰产模范的经验，决心提高单位面积产量，大家都有信心在去年的基础上增产百分之三十。全乡已沤粪四十二万担左右，计划要每亩田上粪五十担至六十担。全乡修好了一百二十七口水塘、二十座坝、六条圳和两口井，可保六十天不旱。我们把优抚工作看得很重要，除了替烈属军属做了一万一千多个代耕工之外，还帮助他们打了很多柴。
    敬爱的彭司令员！美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国境内撒布细菌的滔天罪行，更加激起了我们的愤怒和痛恨。请转告全体志愿军同志：我们决心以实际行动响应政府的一切号召，继续加强抗美援朝运动，支援你们和朝鲜人民军，彻底击破美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    致崇高的革命敬礼
    湖南湘潭县韶山乡全体人民
