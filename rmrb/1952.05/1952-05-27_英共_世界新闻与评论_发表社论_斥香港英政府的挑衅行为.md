Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 25th -- The British Communist Party's magazine "World News and Reviews" recently published an editorial entitled "Stop Persecuting Chinese in Hong Kong," calling on British workers to protest the British government's actions in Hong Kong. The editorial stated: "Since the Conservatives came to power in Britain, the Hong Kong government has fully complied with the United States' policy of aggression against China, carrying out a series of provocative actions, arrests, prosecutions, and deportations against Chinese staff and trade union workers in Hong Kong. The purpose of these actions is to turn Hong Kong into a base for aggressive war and to extinguish any expression of sympathy for the Chinese People's Government." Following the provocative actions of British police against peaceful Chinese people and the Hong Kong government's persecution of the Ta Kung Pao, the British authorities are continuing to deport Chinese trade union workers.

The editorial emphasized that the Chinese people can never tolerate such serious hostile actions by the British government, and they are determined to fight resolutely to safeguard the legitimate rights of their compatriots in Hong Kong.

The editorial concluded by calling on "every working-class organization in Britain to immediately demand an end to this brutal attack on Chinese staff and civil liberties in Hong Kong, in order to preserve the friendship and trade with the Chinese people, which are of vital interest to us. As British Communist Party Vice-Chairman Dutt said on May 17th: 'Britain's actions in Hong Kong are decisive for the future of Sino-British relations. If we continue to take these measures, these provocative police actions will make Hong Kong a dangerous place for expanding the war in the Far East.'"

    英共“世界新闻与评论”发表社论
    斥香港英政府的挑衅行为
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】英国共产党出版的
    “世界新闻与评论”杂志最近一期发表题为“停止迫害香港的中国人”的社论，号召英国工人抗议英国政府在香港的行动。社论说：“保守党在英国上台后，香港政府完全遵照美国的对华侵略政策，对香港的中国工作人员与工会工作者进行了一连串的挑衅、逮捕、起诉与驱逐行动。这些行动的目的是要把香港变成侵略战争的基地，灭绝同情中国人民政府的任何表示。”继英国警察对和平的中国人民的挑衅行动、香港政府对大公报的迫害以后，英国当局还在继续驱逐中国的工会工作者出境。
    社论强调指出中国人民决不能容忍英国政府这种严重的敌意行动，他们决心为保障他们的在港同胞的正当权利而坚决斗争到底。
    社论最后号召英国“每一个工人阶级的组织都必须立刻要求停止这种对香港中国工作人员与公民自由的残暴进攻，以保全与我们有切身利害关系的对中国人民的友谊和贸易。正如英国共产党副主席杜德五月十七日所说：‘英国在香港的行动，对于中英两国邦交前途是有决定性作用的。如果我们继续采取这些措施，这些挑衅性的警察行动就会使香港成为在远东扩大战争的一个危险地点。’”
