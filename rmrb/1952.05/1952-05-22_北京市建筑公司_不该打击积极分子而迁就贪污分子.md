    To the Editorial Department:

    Recently, the Beijing Construction Company seriously violated policy when allocating cadre positions. How are the leaders treating the activists in the "Three-Anti" movement? Instead of following the central government's orders to boldly promote workers with ability, prestige among the masses, and a consistently positive attitude to become cadres, or promoting these people to leadership positions, they are doing the opposite, striking at the "tiger"-fighting team members. Zhang Zhaofang, deputy director of the company's construction department, was suspended from his duties for his right-leaning ideology and obstructing the movement. Not long after Zhang Zhaofang was reinstated, he ordered the personnel department to demote Duan Tongyuan, an active "tiger" fighter, from assistant material administrator to common laborer. Xu Mingsheng, another active "tiger" fighter, who used to be the guard captain, has also been demoted to guard for no reason. On the other hand, the company's leadership is being overly accommodating to grafters. Li Wentian, the material administrator at the Guanghua Textile Factory construction site, was demoted for embezzling more than 10 million yuan, but the responsible cadres at the site not only did not implement this punishment, but also ordered Li Wentian to be responsible for management work, and even appointed him as the squad leader during the "May Day" parade. The case of Shen Rusong, who embezzled 28.8 million yuan, has not yet been processed, but he has already been promoted to deputy director of the construction site. Some people in the company have started calling those who embezzled tens of millions of yuan and are about to be convicted "Section Chief So-and-so" and "Director So-and-so" again. The workers are therefore questioning the effectiveness of the "Three-Anti" movement.

    Currently, the company's leading cadres still believe that grafters are capable and indispensable, and there are no plans to promote activists among the workers. This is extremely wrong. This mistake has already created a very bad influence among the masses. It is hoped that the company's leading cadres will pay attention to correcting this issue.

### 北京市建筑公司  不该打击积极分子而迁就贪污分子

    北京市建筑公司
    不该打击积极分子而迁就贪污分子
    编辑同志：北京市建筑公司最近在分配干部工作时，严重地违反了政策。领导方面怎样来对待“三反”运动中的积极分子呢？他们不是依照中央发布的命令，大胆放手提拔在工作中有能力、在群众中有威信、一贯积极的工人当干部，或提拔这些人到领导岗位上去，而是相反，对打“虎”队员给以打击。公司施工部副主任张兆芳，在运动中因思想右倾，阻碍运动而被停职。张兆芳复职不久，竟命令管人事的部门把积极打“虎”的队员段同元从助理材料管理员降为小工。打“虎”积极分子许明生，过去是警卫队长，现在也无故被降为警卫员。该公司领导方面，对待贪污分子却是过分迁就。光华纺织厂工地材料管理员李文田，因贪污一千多万元受到降职处分，但工地负责干部不但不执行这一处分，反令李文田负责管理工作，“五一”节游行时并被派为中队长。沈汝松贪污二千八百万元的案件还没有处理，却已经被提升为工地副主任了。公司里有些人对贪污几千万元即将判罪的人，重新喊起“某某科长”“某某主任”来。工人群众因此对“三反”运动的效果发生了怀疑。
    现在，公司领导干部思想上仍认为贪污分子有能力，离不了他们，还没有有计划地在工人中提拔积极分子。这是极端错误的。这个错误已在群众中造成很坏的影响。希望公司领导干部注意纠正这个问题。
