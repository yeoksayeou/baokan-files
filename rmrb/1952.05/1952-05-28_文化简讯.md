Cultural Briefs

    ▲ To commemorate the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the innovated combined first and second issues of "Popular Cinema" have been published ahead of schedule. This publication is the result of the decision by the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to adjust Beijing's literary and artistic publications, merging "Popular Cinema" and "New Cinema." The newly launched "Popular Cinema" published an editorial titled "Film Workers Commemorate the Tenth Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.'" In the column "On the Film Front of Our People," it reported on various recent measures taken in film work to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, summarized the in-depth practical struggles of film workers after the Beijing literary and artistic rectification study, and introduced the establishment of educational short film production institutions to meet the needs of workers, peasants, and laborers, as well as the tremendous changes in the national film audience.
    ▲ To solve the problem of school buildings after the implementation of the new school system in 107 primary schools in the suburbs this autumn, the Xi'an Municipal People's Government, with the enthusiastic support of all farmers in the suburbs, launched a mass school-building movement. To date, 216 classrooms and 74 teachers' dormitories in the suburbs have been completed, expanding the original school buildings by more than 50%. Many neat and bright new school buildings have been adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao, from which emanate the joyful sounds of reading and singing from the pupils.
