Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 20th: The Executive Bureau of the All-India Peace Council held a special meeting in Bombay on the 5th to discuss India's participation in the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference scheduled to be held in Beijing on May 28th. The Executive Bureau passed the following resolution:

"The All-India Peace Council warmly supports the call from our Chinese friends to convene the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and again expresses our apologies for not being able to host this historic conference. We are very grateful to our Chinese friends for accepting our suggestion to undertake the task of organizing this conference in Beijing.

"Such a conference should have been convened long ago. Wars – colonial wars and intervention wars – have already broken out in several places on Asian soil. In fact, war-mongers want to experiment with their machines of death and destruction in Asia first. And for months, the enemies of peace have been openly debating whether to launch a world war in Asia or in Europe. The great and noble force we represent has grown unprecedentedly strong and has given a powerful blow to those who want to deprive us of our peace, but we must still finally and effectively stop the evil and cruel plans of the war-mongers.

"To achieve this goal, the people of Asia must unite. They must transcend the obstacles and distinctions of nationality, language, culture, and different economic systems, and speak out loudly and heroically against all forms of war threats. They must consolidate the peace forces of Asia, and therefore, they must unite with friends in other parts of the world to ensure the victory of our common cause.

"In adopting its attitude towards the serious issues concerning peace and progress in Asia, the All-India Peace Council firmly believes that the agenda, discussions, and decisions of the Asian Peace Conference should not only inspire millions of people in Asia to rise up and fight for peace but also make it possible for people with various opinions in Asia to wholeheartedly participate in our great work. Only in this way can our enemies be isolated and paralyzed."

The Executive Bureau unanimously appointed the following representatives to attend the preparatory meeting to be held in Beijing: Professor D.D. Kosambi, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, and scientist (Head of Delegation); Gurbakhsh Singh, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, and writer; Yanik, a peasant leader; Romesh Chandra, Organizing Secretary of the All-India Peace Council, and journalist.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 20th: Prominent figures from all walks of life in Korea have recently made speeches, unanimously supporting the call for convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference by Song Qingling, Guo Moruo, and other eleven prominent figures dedicated to the cause of peace in our country, and firmly believing that the Peace Conference will be a success.

Hyun Chil-jong, a member of the Korean Preparatory Committee for the Peace Conference and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Farmers' Union, said: The Korean farmers, together with all the people of Korea, warmly welcome and support the call and suggestion of the famous Chinese peace fighters to convene the Peace Conference. The Korean Farmers' Union will widely explain and publicize the great significance of convening the Peace Conference to all farmers, and will actively prepare for participating in the Peace Conference together with the broad masses of farmers. We believe that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will achieve great success and give a fatal blow to the war-mongers who are frantically preparing for war.

Cho Bok-rye, a member of the Korean Preparatory Committee for the Peace Conference and Vice-Chairman of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, said: In the Far East and the Pacific region, maintaining peace has become the most urgent struggle for all good people. Therefore, the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has a very important role in the cause of defending world peace. We Korean women warmly welcome the convening of this Peace Conference and have deep expectations for it. Korean women will resolutely oppose aggression with greater enthusiasm and continue to fight to defend peace in the Far East.

Li Qingyuan, a famous Korean historian, said: The suggestion of the famous Chinese peace fighters to convene the Peace Conference is most timely at present. We firmly express our support. Li Qingyuan urged the people in the Asian and Pacific regions, where the threat of war is increasing, to further strengthen friendship and unity to defend peace.

Pastor Park Ki-hwan, Secretary-General of the North Korean Christian League and pastor, pointed out: We Korean Christians are convinced that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will make a significant contribution to the struggle for peace and security. We will implement the spirit of the Peace Conference proposal and fight to the end with all the Korean people for the freedom and independence of the motherland and for peace in the Far East.

    全印和平理事会和朝鲜各界著名人士
    热烈支持在北京举行和平会议
    全印和平理事会推定参加筹备会议的代表
    【新华社新德里二十日电】印度的全印和平理事会执行局五日在孟买举行特别会议，讨论印度参加定于五月二十八日在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的问题。执行局通过决议如下：
    “全印和平理事会热烈支持我们中国友人发出的关于召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的号召，并再度为我们不能担任这个历史性会议的主人表示歉意。我们很感激我们的中国友人接受了我们的建议，担负起在北京组织这次会议的任务。
    “这样的会议早就应该召开了。在亚洲的土地上已经有好几个地方爆发了战争——殖民战争和干涉战争。事实上，战争制造者想先拿亚洲来试验他们的死亡和毁灭的机器。而数月以来，和平的敌人就在公开辩论究竟应该在亚洲还是在欧洲发动世界大战。我们所代表的伟大而崇高的力量已经空前壮大，并且已给那些想要剥夺我们的和平的人以强有力的打击，但是我们还必须最后有效地制止战争贩子的罪恶和残酷的计划。
    “为了达到这个目的，亚洲人民必须团结起来。他们必须超越国籍、语言、文化和不同的经济制度的障碍和区分，大声疾呼地英勇地反对各种形式的战争威胁，他们必须巩固亚洲的和平力量，因此，他们必须与世界其他部分的友人团结起来，保证我们的共同事业获得胜利。
    “全印和平理事会在通过它对有关亚洲和平与进步的严重问题所采取的态度的时候，坚决认为：亚洲和平会议的议程、讨论和决定应该不仅能够鼓舞亚洲千百万人民起来进行斗争谋求和平，而且能够使亚洲具有各种意见的人士有可能全心全意地参加我们的伟大工作。只有这样才能使我们的敌人陷于孤立和瘫痪。”
    执行局一致推定出席在北京举行的筹备会议的代表名单如下：全印和平理事会副主席、科学家高善必教授（团长）；全印和平理事会副主席、作家古尔巴克希·辛格；农民领袖雅尼克；全印和平理事会组织秘书，新闻记者罗米西·钱德拉。
    【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜各界著名人士最近纷纷发表谈话，一致拥护我国宋庆龄、郭沫若等十一位努力和平事业的著名人士关于召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起书，并坚决相信和平会议一定获得成功。
    朝鲜参加和平会议筹备委员会委员、朝鲜农民同盟中央委员会副委员长玄七钟说：朝鲜农民和全朝鲜人民一道，热烈欢迎和支持中国著名和平战士们关于召开和平会议的号召和建议。朝鲜农民同盟要向全体农民广泛地解释和宣传召开和平会议的伟大意义，要和全体农民群众一起积极进行参加和平会议的准备工作。我们相信亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议一定会取得巨大的成就，并给疯狂备战的战争贩子以致命的打击。
    朝鲜参加和平会议筹备委员会委员、朝鲜民主妇女同盟副委员长赵福礼说：在远东和太平洋区域，维护和平已成为一切善良人民的最迫切的斗争。因此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，在保卫全世界和平的事业上具有极重要的作用。我们朝鲜妇女热烈欢迎这个和平会议的召开，并对它怀着深切的期望。朝鲜妇女要以更高的热情坚决反对侵略，继续进行捍卫远东和平的斗争。
    朝鲜著名历史学家李清源说：中国著名的和平战士们关于召开和平会议的建议，在目前提出是最适合时宜的。我们坚决表示支持。李清源敦促在战争威胁日益加重的亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，进一步加强友谊团结，保卫和平。
    北朝鲜基督教徒联盟书记长、牧师朴基焕指出：我们朝鲜基督教徒确信亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对争取和平安全的斗争必有重大的贡献。我们要贯彻关于和平会议建议的精神，和全朝鲜人民一道为祖国的自由、独立，为远东的和平而斗争到底。
