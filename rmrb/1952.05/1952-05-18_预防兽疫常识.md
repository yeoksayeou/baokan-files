Common Knowledge of Animal Disease Prevention
Cheng Shaohui, Director of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

Raising livestock well is an important task in the rural patriotic production increase movement. Livestock not only provide power and manure, but also are an important source of sideline income for farmers. The American aggressors' scattering of germs and viruses in China and Korea, to kill livestock and poultry is also one of their goals. Chinese scientists have definitively proven that some of the poisonous insects and objects scattered by the American aggressors carry anthrax bacilli and Pasteurella. These bacteria can cause livestock to suffer from anthrax or poultry to suffer from hemorrhagic septicemia. Therefore, our work in preventing animal diseases this year is more important than usual. In recent years, the Chinese people have made remarkable achievements in the prevention and treatment of animal diseases. As long as we are vigilant and strengthen our defenses, we will be able to defeat any vicious conspiracy of the American aggressors. The following are some common knowledge about the prevention of animal diseases.

I. Improve livestock hygiene. Animal diseases, like human diseases, are caused by germs and viruses. To prevent animal diseases, the sheds of livestock must be kept dry, clean, well-ventilated, and with sufficient sunlight. Add soil and sweep manure frequently, and repair them every year to avoid wind and rain. In some places, sheds are not built for certain livestock, which is detrimental to the health of the livestock. Troughs should be cleaned regularly, and leftover materials should be swept away daily. The sheds are best plastered with lime. The treatment and preservation of livestock manure should also be studied and improved. Manure piles and pits should be separated from the sheds. Manure piles should be located in secluded places away from people and animals, and manure pits should be covered to prevent the breeding of flies, mosquitoes, and other parasites, and to preserve the fertility of the fertilizer. Animal manure should be applied to the fields after fermentation, which can kill germs and prevent the spread of disease. Regular washing of livestock can prevent parasites and skin diseases. If livestock have lice, ticks, and fleas, they should be caught and cleaned regularly, or killed with rotenone powder, pyrethrum powder, tobacco water, etc. Mosquito prevention for livestock is also necessary. Paying attention to these tasks can not only prevent animal diseases, but also make livestock healthy, accelerate reproduction, and benefit people's cleaning and hygiene work. There are many benefits.

II. Pay attention to feeding management. Healthy livestock are not susceptible to disease, and even if they are sick, they are easy to cure, because healthy livestock have a greater resistance to toxic bacteria and viruses. If you want livestock to be healthy, you must feed them properly. Each year, enough fodder should be stored - wheat straw, rice straw, sweet potato vines, peanut vines, etc. If it is not enough, wild grass should be cut and dried in the summer or made into silage to prepare for the winter. All fodder should be stored well to prevent mildew or exposure to sunlight and rain, so as not to lose nutrients. In some places, alfalfa is planted, which can be used as green manure or to feed livestock. In some places, when harvesting broad beans and soybeans, the bean leaves are dried and made into feed. These methods are worth promoting. Some people do not build pens for raising pigs, which not only wastes fertilizer, but also easily gets disease. It should be promoted that pigs should be raised in pens.

The drinking water for livestock should be clean. It is best to use well water or spring water to drink for livestock, and do not let livestock drink unclean pond water or ditch water. In addition, pay attention to giving water and grass on time, and do not make livestock hungry one meal and full one meal. This has a great relationship with the health of livestock.

III. Report animal diseases to higher authorities quickly. In order to prevent animal diseases and smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, all localities should establish a reporting system for livestock and poultry diseases and deaths, so that veterinary organs can send people in time to diagnose and prevent diseases. If livestock owners find that their livestock are sick or dead, they should immediately report to the village's epidemic prevention committee. The epidemic prevention committee should immediately understand the condition in detail and report it to the higher authorities as soon as possible for appropriate handling and prevention to avoid spreading.

IV. Implement preventive injections. In areas where American imperialism may spread animal disease bacteria, vigilance should be heightened and attention should be paid to the occurrence of animal diseases. In areas where animal diseases are found and in the vicinity, all livestock and poultry that may be affected by the plague should be universally vaccinated against this animal disease. In particular, the bacteria of diseases such as anthrax (commonly known as Huang), emphysema, and swine erysipelas can survive in the soil for many years. Therefore, livestock in places where these diseases have occurred should be injected annually to prevent continued harm.

V. Strictly implement blockade, isolation, disinfection and disposal of corpses for diseased livestock and epidemic areas. If livestock owners find that their poultry or livestock have infectious diseases or suspected infectious diseases, in addition to reporting them quickly, they should immediately separate healthy livestock from sick livestock to avoid infection. In the event of highly contagious diseases (such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, hog cholera, swine erysipelas, anthrax, etc.), sick livestock should be fed by special personnel, and sick livestock should never be released outside the isolation circle. Other livestock and poultry should be tied up so that they do not enter the sick livestock circle or the epidemic area. At the same time, sheds and utensils should be disinfected. For the disinfection of viruses (such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, hog cholera, etc.), 20% hot plant ash water, or 2% to 5% dry alkali water, or 1% formalin solution can be used. For bacteria (such as erysipelas, swine fever, chicken and duck hemorrhagic septicemia), use 2% to 5% carbolic acid or Lysol and other disinfectant solutions. Anthrax and emphysema bacteria can produce highly resistant spores, which should be treated with formalin gas or liquid or 1/1000 hydrochloric acid mercuric chloride solution. For the disinfection of various utensils, dust and manure should be removed first, and then thoroughly washed with disinfectant solution. After being exposed to strong sunlight for four to five hours, general bacteria can be killed. Utensils with low value and can be burned should be burned. The excrement of sick livestock should be treated with disinfectant or burned to sterilize. Manure must be completely fermented before it can be used, but the manure of anthrax-infected livestock and emphysema-infected livestock should be completely burned. Each disinfection must be thorough, otherwise the germs and viruses left behind can still infect healthy livestock. The disposal of the corpses of diseased livestock should be more cautious. The skin should not be peeled off and the meat eaten. A high ground far away from water wells and rivers should be selected, a seven-foot deep pit should be dug, and lime should be added to bury it, or the corpse should be burned to avoid infectious germs. The blood and muscles of livestock suffering from anthrax contain a large amount of anthrax bacteria, and people who eat it will die from anthrax. For highly epidemic animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, and hog cholera, blockade measures should be implemented to curb the epidemic. The veterinarians and the epidemic prevention committee should delineate the villages with the epidemic as the epidemic area, and the villages without the epidemic as the non-epidemic area, cut off the traffic between them, stop the livestock markets in the epidemic area, and prohibit the free migration of livestock and the sale of livestock products until the animal epidemic stops. Isolation, disinfection, blockade and disposal of dead livestock are the most important issues in eradicating animal diseases. We must rely on the masses, organize the masses, and strictly abide by the animal disease prevention and control measures promulgated by the government in order to quickly eradicate animal diseases.

VI. In order to do these tasks well, the relevant leading organs, veterinarians, scientific workers and propaganda workers in all parts of the country should vigorously publicize the common knowledge of animal disease prevention to the livestock raising masses, overcome some feudal superstitions and habits that do not attach importance to livestock hygiene, and at the same time, mobilize the livestock owners and the forces for preventing and treating animal diseases to organize and rely on the power of everyone to work together to prevent animal diseases. Animal Loving Committees have been organized in some rural areas in northern Sichuan and Jiangxi. The farmers in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have organized animal-loving groups, and the district has organized all the Chinese veterinarians in the district, trained them, improved their skills, and established veterinary stations in counties and districts to handle livestock health care, trough protection, treatment, epidemic prevention, and environmental sanitation in rural areas. These systems and methods have played a great role in protecting livestock health. These experiences should be promoted throughout the country to establish a strong front for the prevention of animal diseases throughout the country, so as to protect livestock, ensure the victory of the rural patriotic production increase movement, and completely smash the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors.

    预防兽疫常识
    中央人民政府农业部畜牧兽医司司长　程绍回
    养好牲畜是农村爱国增产运动中一项重要的工作。牲畜不独供给动力和粪肥，而且是农民副业收入的重要来源。美国侵略者这次在中朝两国境内撒布病菌病毒，杀害家畜家禽也是他们的目标之一。我国科学家已确实证明，在美国侵略者撒下的毒虫毒物中，有的带有炭疽杆菌和巴士特杆菌。这些细菌能使家畜患炭疽病或使家禽患出血性败血病。因此，我们今年防治兽疫的工作，较平时更加重要。我国人民数年来在防治兽疫方面，已获得显著的成绩，我们只要提高警惕，加强防御，就足以击败美国侵略者的任何恶毒阴谋。下面是预防兽疫的一些常识。
    一、搞好牲畜卫生。牲畜的疫病也和人的疫病一样，是病菌和病毒所引起的。要预防兽疫，首先就要使牲畜的棚圈保持干燥、清洁、空气流通、日光充足，常垫土、勤扫粪，年年修补，以避风雨。有的地方对某些牲畜不建棚圈，这对牲畜的健康是有妨碍的。食槽要常清洗，残料剩草每日打扫。棚圈最好用石灰粉刷。牲畜粪便的处理和保存，也应研究改良。粪堆、粪坑要与棚圈分开。粪堆应选择远离人畜的僻静地点，粪坑要加掩盖，以免蝇、蚊和其他寄生虫繁殖，并保存肥料的肥力。畜肥应在发酵以后下田，这样能杀死病菌，免于传播疫病。牲畜身体常洗刷，就不生寄生虫和皮肤病。牲畜身上长了虱子、扁虱、跳蚤，要常捕捉干净，或用鱼藤粉、除虫菊粉、烟叶水等杀灭。还要给牲畜防蚊。注意这些工作，不独能预防兽疫，而且能使牲畜健壮，繁殖加速，又有益于人的清洁卫生工作。好处是很多的。
    二、注意饲养管理。健壮的牲畜不容易患病，就是病了也容易治好。因为健壮的牲畜抵抗毒菌病毒的力量大。若要牲畜健壮，必须饲养得法。每年要存储足够的草料——麦秸、谷草、稻草、白薯藤、花生藤等。不足时要在夏天割野草晒干或制成青储草，以备过冬。一切草料要保存好，不使发霉或受日晒雨淋，以免损失养分。有的地方种植苜蓿，既可作绿肥，也可以喂牲畜。有的地方收割蚕豆、大豆时，把豆叶晒干制成饲料。这些办法都值得提倡。有的人喂猪不设圈，既损失肥料，又易得疫病，应该提倡养猪都圈起来。
    牲畜的饮水要注意清洁。最好用井水、泉水饮牲口，不要叫牲畜喝不洁净的塘水、沟水。另外，要注意按时给水给草，不要使牲畜饥一顿，饱一顿。这对牲畜的健康有很大关系。
    三、发现兽疫要迅速向上级报告。为了防止兽疫，粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战，各地应建立禽畜疾病死亡报告制度，以便兽医机关及时派人诊断和防治。畜主发现牲畜患病或死亡，应立刻报告乡村的防疫委员会。防疫委员会应立即详细了解病情，赶快报告上级，作适当的处理和防治，以免蔓延。
    四、实施预防注射。在美帝国主义可能撒播兽疫细菌的地区，应提高警惕注意兽疫发生。在发现兽疫的地区及其附近，所有可能害瘟的牲畜、家禽，要普遍打预防这种兽疫的防疫针。特别是炭疽（俗称癀）、气肿疽、猪丹毒等病的病菌，能够在土壤里生存多年，因此，发生过这些病的地方的牲畜，应连年实施注射，以免继续为害。
    五、对疫畜和疫区要严格地施行封锁、隔离、消毒和处理尸体。畜主发现禽畜患传染病或疑似传染病时，除迅速报告外，应立即把健康牲畜和病畜分开，以免传染。如遇传染性强烈的病（如口蹄疫、牛瘟、猪瘟、猪丹毒、炭疽等），应由专人饲养病畜，千万不要把病畜放出隔离圈外。其他禽畜应拴起，不使进入疫畜圈或疫区。同时，要对棚圈和器物实行消毒。对病毒（如口蹄疫、牛瘟、猪瘟等）的消毒，可用百分之二十热草木灰水，或百分之二至五的干碱水，或百分之一的弗马林液。对病菌
    （如丹毒、猪肺疫、鸡鸭出血性败血病）用百分之二至五的石炭酸、或来沙儿等消毒液。炭疽菌和气肿疽菌能产生抵抗力强大的芽胞，要用弗马林气体或液体或千分之一盐酸升汞液。各种器物的消毒均应先清除尘土粪便，然后用消毒液彻底洗刷，用强烈日光晒四至五小时后，一般细菌均可杀死，其价值低廉而可焚烧的器物均应焚烧。病畜的排泄物应用消毒药处理，或焚烧灭菌。粪便须经完全发酵后方得利用，但炭疽病畜和气肿疽病畜的粪便应全部焚烧。每次消毒必须彻底，不然病菌病毒遗留下去仍可传染健康的牲畜。处理疫畜的尸体更应慎重，不应剥皮吃肉，应择离水井河流较远的高地，挖七尺深坑，加上石灰掩埋，或将尸体焚烧以免传染病菌。患炭疽病的牲畜尸体的血液中和肌肉内，有大量炭疽菌，人吃了会害炭疽病死亡。对于流行性剧烈的兽疫如口蹄疫、牛瘟、猪瘟应施行封锁办法以遏止流行，由兽医会同防疫委员会划定有疫的村庄为疫区，无疫的村庄为非疫区，断绝其间的交通，停止疫区内的牲畜集市，禁止牲畜自由迁移和畜产品的买卖，直至兽疫停止流行时才能解除封锁。隔离消毒封锁处理死畜是扑灭兽疫中最关紧要的问题。我们必须依靠群众，组织群众，严格遵守政府颁布的兽疫防治办法，才能迅速扑灭兽疫。
    六、为了做好这些工作，全国各地的有关领导机关、兽医工作者、科学工作者和宣传工作人员，应大力向养畜群众宣传预防兽疫的常识，克服某些封建迷信思想以及不重视牲畜卫生的习惯，同时，发动畜主和防治兽疫的力量组织起来，依靠大家的力量，同心协力来预防兽疫。川北、江西等地部分农村中组织了爱畜委员会。山西长治专区的农民组织了爱畜小组，该区并将全区的中兽医组织起来加以训练，提高技术，建立县区的兽医站，办理乡村的牲畜保健、保槽、治疗、防疫、环境卫生等工作。这些制度和办法，都对保护牲畜健康起了很大的作用。全国各地都应该推广这些经验，建立起全国的预防兽疫的坚强阵线，以保护牲畜，保证农村爱国增产运动的胜利，并彻底粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战。第七十一期中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会编
