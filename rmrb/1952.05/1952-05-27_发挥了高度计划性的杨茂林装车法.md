    Yang Maolin Loading Method with High Degree of Planning
    By our reporter Chen Ji

    Last July, Yang Maolin, the chief weigher of Harbin Station of the China Changchun Railway Administration, learned from advanced Soviet experiences and increased the average load of each less-than-carload lot by ten tons, while eliminating accidents that people in the past thought could not be eliminated. At that time, some people did not recognize the importance of this matter, always feeling that "a few more goods loaded are not worth mentioning!" However, people gradually realized the significance of this matter. Today, when the national railway is carrying out the movement of full loading, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers, people are talking about this matter. Yang Maolin's method of loading more goods on freight cars is called the Yang Maolin Loading Method, and it has become an advanced method that commercial workers of the national railway must learn.

    What are the main contents of the Yang Maolin Loading Method? Where does its superiority lie? Why is it worth promoting? To understand these questions, I visited Yang Maolin and studied these issues with comrades from the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. The basic purpose of the Yang Maolin Loading Method is to achieve full loading – to load more goods and save railcars. In the past, each car could only load sixteen or seventeen tons. After the implementation of the Yang Maolin Loading Method, each car can load twenty-six or twenty-seven tons. Why can he load more goods and save railcars? It is mainly because Yang Maolin boldly broke the old operating methods, planned his work, and gave full play to the transportation capacity of the vehicles. Yang Maolin is a weigher, and his job is to load goods into the carriages. For many years, loading goods has been an unplanned and extremely passive job. The weigher can only load the goods when the consignor sends them. In order to transport the goods waiting to be transported at stations along the way, the train must hang many less-than-carload lots. A less-than-carload lot could originally load thirty tons of goods, but in order to transport goods along the way, space must be left in the vehicle. Thus, a less-than-carload lot in the past often could only load five to ten tons of goods. Yang Maolin created the "Planned Transportation Method for Less-than-Carload Lots," which solved this contradiction. He consulted with the consignors in advance, made transportation plans for less-than-carload lots, and collected less-than-carload lots from different consignors going to the same area to form fully loaded less-than-carload lots. Fully loaded less-than-carload lots do not need to leave empty space. Less-than-carload lots used to load five tons per car, or at most sixteen tons, but fully loaded less-than-carload lots can load twenty-seven tons per car. Less-than-carload lots must stop at each station, thus lengthening the vehicle's operating time. Fully loaded less-than-carload lots only have one destination, so they do not need to stop at every station.

    In the past, general freight cars were not fully loaded and did not exert their effectiveness. In response to this situation, Yang Maolin improved loading techniques. When loading, he implemented mixed loading and clever loading based on the shape, weight, and other differences of the goods. For example, insert long objects into the gaps of round objects. This way, you can make the most of the space and load more goods. This is what Yang Maolin calls "drilling into the seams and squeezing into the gaps." But in the past, it was not like this. No matter what kind of goods, it was considered finished after being loaded onto the car. There was never any initiative to use space to load more goods. Yang Maolin also often consulted with the consignors, asking them to tighten the goods as much as possible when packaging, reducing the volume of the packaging to increase the amount of loading. It can be seen that Yang Maolin always thinks of ways to give play to the potential transportation capacity.

    In the past, loading cars was not only not fully loaded, but also often resulted in missed loading, misloading, and poor loading. In the past, the weighers responsible for loading cars were nominally supervising weighers, but in reality, they did not supervise. The "Flag Matching Loading Method" created by Yang Maolin was to eliminate this corrupt phenomenon of the past. In the past, when consignors sent goods, they were placed messily in the warehouse. When the vehicle arrived, the weigher would take the waybill and look for the goods everywhere, and the stevedores would run back and forth behind the weigher. The stevedores listened to the weigher's instructions and loaded whatever they were told to load. If the weigher gave the wrong instructions, the stevedores would load the wrong goods. Because there were too many vehicles, the stevedores often loaded the goods from car A onto car B. The weigher was busy looking for the goods in a hurry, so he could not supervise the stevedores. Because the goods were found only temporarily, the misplaced goods often could not be found quickly. Sometimes it took a long time to find a piece of goods, and sometimes it could not be found, so it had to be left un-transported. In this way, the phenomena of missed loading, misloading, and poor loading continued to occur. Yang Maolin corrected this chaotic way of working. Before loading, he made a loading plan, sorted out the goods to be transported in advance, divided them into several categories according to their shape and nature, arranged the order of loading, and inserted small flags with different marks on each type of goods; at the same time, he filled out a list of the loading order and handed it to the stevedores. The stevedores looked at the goods to be transported in advance and prepared to load them. When the vehicle arrived, Yang Maolin immediately inserted large flags with different marks on the vehicle. The stevedores loaded the goods with small flags into the vehicles with corresponding large flags according to the order on the list. This can avoid misloading and missed loading. The weigher no longer had to look for goods everywhere like in the past, and had time to supervise the stevedores to load the goods well. Yang Maolin implemented this flag matching loading method, which not only eliminated the phenomena of missed loading, misloading, and poor loading, but also saved loading time. It used to take four hours to load a car, but with Yang Maolin's method, it only takes fifty minutes to load a car.

    In order to further ensure that more goods are loaded and to avoid accidents, Yang Maolin took the initiative to formulate a Goods Guarantee Note. The Goods Guarantee Note is Yang Maolin's method of consciously checking his own work. After the car is loaded, the weigher fills in the name of the sending station, the freight car number, the loading date, the name of the destination station, etc. on a Goods Guarantee Note and sends it to the stationmaster of the destination station. When the goods arrive at the destination, the staff at the destination unload the goods and fill in the unloading date, arrival status (whether there are any missed loading, misloading, or insufficient loading, etc.) and other items on the Goods Guarantee Note and send it back to the stationmaster of the original sending station. In this way, the relevant parties can know from the Goods Guarantee Note whether the weigher's work is good or bad and the reason for the good or bad work. However, in the past, after the weigher finished loading the car and sent it out, everything was fine. No one cared about whether there were any errors after these goods arrived at the destination. Even if there were errors, no one knew who loaded them or who should be responsible. At the same time, no one studied the past errors and shortcomings and found ways to improve the work. The Goods Guarantee Note formulated by Yang Maolin is to make the weigher load the goods conscientiously and responsibly in order to meet the requirements of full loading and no accidents. This Goods Guarantee Note is not a railway regulation or a prescribed system, nor is it an important legal basis for handling accidents, but a regulation automatically created by Yang Maolin.

    The above is the main content of Yang Maolin's loading method. This content shows that Yang Maolin dared to break the rules, was brave enough to find out the shortcomings in his work, and changed the past blind, passive, and chaotic work methods, creating an active, planned, and step-by-step work method. This gave full play to the potential capacity of the vehicles, loaded more goods, and eliminated accidents. This is why the Yang Maolin loading method is advanced.

    Promoting the Yang Maolin loading method is an important method for increasing production and practicing economy in the railway transportation department. The figures for Yang Maolin's loading in October of last year most powerfully illustrate this problem. In October of last year, Yang Maolin loaded 210.5 cars, each loaded with 26.7 tons of goods, for a total of 5,620.35 tons of goods. If the cars were loaded according to the original standard (i.e., the standard of the China Changchun Railway Administration, which is 17 tons of goods per car), then 330.61 cars would be needed to load 5,620.35 tons of goods. This means that Yang Maolin saved the state 120.11 cars in October. If the cars were loaded according to the original standard of 17 tons of goods per car, then Yang Maolin could only load 3,578.5 tons of goods in the 210.5 cars shipped in October. In other words, Yang Maolin loaded an additional 2,041.85 tons of goods for the state in October. From this, it is very clear that promoting the Yang Maolin loading method is of great significance and is very necessary.

    Due to the preliminary promotion of the Yang Maolin loading method, the quality of freight car loading has been improved on national railways. The Jinan Railway Administration promoted the Yang Maolin loading method and thus loaded more goods. In the past, each car only loaded 17.28 tons of goods, but now each car can load 26.75 tons of goods. Gao Benqiang, a weigher at Guangzhou South Station, actively led all employees to learn the Yang Maolin loading method, and there has been significant progress in loading work. Last December, Guangzhou South Station only loaded 22.72 tons per car. This January, it loaded 25.921 tons, and this March, it increased to 28.2 tons.

    Some stations have learned Yang Maolin's loading techniques and implemented mixed loading, greatly increasing the loading capacity of freight cars. When loading miscellaneous goods, workers at Jinzhou Station mixed round goods with long goods, and thus created the highest record of 30.5 tons per boxcar, 32.5 tons per open car, and 30.1 tons per flatcar. Workers at Xuchang Station improved the loading method for tobacco leaves, increasing the load from 14 tons per car in the past to 23 tons now.

    The freight handlers at some stations took the initiative to find the consignors and persuaded them to tighten the goods as much as possible when packaging them in order to reduce the volume of the packaged goods. Gao Yanchang and Xu Chengwen, freight handlers at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, helped consignors package jute, reducing the volume of each bundle of jute, and thus increasing the load per car from 13 tons to 23.5 tons. Weighers at Chaoyangzhen Station of the Jilin Railway Bureau persuaded consignors to improve the method of packaging in sacks, increasing the load per car from 20 tons to 30 tons. Workers at Guye Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau used to load 18 tons of coke per car. Now, after learning the Yang Maolin loading method and changing the loading method, each car can load 33 tons.

    After the "Three-Anti" movement, the consciousness of the employees has been generally improved, and the political conditions for promoting the Yang Maolin loading method are mature. The Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways requires all localities to conscientiously learn the Yang Maolin loading method so that the national railway's ongoing movement of full loading, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers can develop vigorously.

    发挥了高度计划性的杨茂林装车法
    本报记者　陈迹
    去年七月，中长铁路管理局哈尔滨车站主任司磅员杨茂林学习苏联先进经验，平均在每辆整装的零担车内多装了十吨货物，并且消灭了人们在过去认为不能消灭的事故。当时某些人没有认识到这件事情的重要性，总觉得：“多装了一些货物，算不了什么！”但是，大家逐渐认识了这件事情的意义，在今天全国铁路开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的时候，人们都在传颂这件事情了。杨茂林在货车上多装货物的方法，被称做杨茂林装车法，成为全国铁路商务工作者必须学习的先进方法。
    杨茂林装车法的主要内容有那些呢？它的优越性表现在那些地方呢？它为什么值得推广呢？为了了解这些问题，我曾经访问过杨茂林，并和铁道部商务局的同志研究了这些问题。杨茂林装车法的基本目的，就是满载——多装货物，节省车皮。过去每辆车只能装十六、七吨，实行杨茂林装车法后，每辆车能装到二十六、七吨。为什么他能够多装货物，节省车皮呢？主要是因为杨茂林大胆地打破了旧的作业方法，有计划地安排自己的工作，充分发挥了车辆的运输力量。杨茂林是一个司磅员，他的工作就是往车厢里装货。多少年来，装货是没有计划、极其被动的工作。货主送来了货物，司磅员才能装。为了装运沿途车站上待运的货物，列车照例得挂很多零担车。一辆零担车本来可以装三十吨货物，但为了装运沿途的货物，必须在车辆上空下货位，这样，一辆零担车在过去往往只能装五吨到十吨的货物。杨茂林创制了“零担货物计划运送办法”，解决了这个矛盾。他和货主预先商量好，做好零担车的运输计划，把不同的货主运往同一地区去的零担货物，集中起来，凑成整装的零担车。整装的零担车，就不必要留下空的货位了。零担车每辆过去装五吨，最多装十六吨，但整装的零担车每辆可以装二十七吨。零担车必须在每个车站停车，因而延长了车辆运转的时间。整装的零担车的目的地只有一个，因此不必站站停车。
    过去一般的货车是不满载的，是没有发挥其效能的。杨茂林针对这种情况，改进了装载的技术。在装车时，他根据货物的形状、轻重等差别，实行配装、巧装。比如在圆形的货物的空隙中，插进长形的货物。这样就可以尽量利用空间，多装货物。这就是杨茂林说的“有缝就钻，有空就挤”。但在过去却不是这样，不问什么货物，装上了车，就算完事，从来就没有主动想法，利用空间，多装货物。杨茂林还经常和货主商量，要求他们在包装货物时，尽量把货物拧紧，缩小包装的体积，以便增加装载的数量。由此可见：杨茂林处处想方法发挥运输的潜在能力。
    过去装车，不只不满载，而且常常发生漏装、错装和装载不良的现象。过去负责装车的司磅员名为监装司磅员，实际是不监装的。杨茂林创造的“对旗装车法”，就是为了消灭过去这种腐朽现象的。在过去，货主送来了货物，就乱七八糟地放在仓库内。等到车辆开来，司磅员才拿着运货单到处找货，装卸工人就跟在司磅员后面跑来跑去。装卸工人听候司磅员吩咐，叫装什么，就装什么。司磅员吩咐错了，装卸工人也就装错了。因为车辆太多，装卸工人常常把甲车上的货装到乙车上去。司磅员慌慌张张地忙着找货物，也就顾不得去监督装卸工人了。因为临时才去找货，乱放的货物常常不能很快找出来。有时要用很长的时间找一件货物，有时找不出，就只好不运。这样，漏装、错装、装载不良的现象就不断出现。杨茂林纠正了这种混乱的工作方式。他在装车以前，就把装车计划做好，把将要运出的货物，预先整理出来，根据它的形状和性质，分成几类，排好装送的次序，并在每类货物上插了有不同记号的小旗；同时，把装送的次序，填成一个清单，交给装卸工人。装卸工人事先就看好将要运出的货物，准备装送。当车辆开来时，杨茂林马上就在车辆上插上有不同记号的大旗。装卸工人按照清单的次序，把插有小旗的货物，装到插有相应的大旗的车辆上。这样，就可以避免错装和漏装。司磅员不再像过去那样到处去找货物，有时间监督装卸工人把货物装好。杨茂林实行了这种对旗装车法，不但消灭了漏装、错装、装载不良的现象，而且节省了装车的时间。过去四个钟头装一车，用杨茂林的方法则只要五十分钟就可以装一车。
    为了进一步保证多装货物并避免事故，杨茂林主动地制订了货物保证笺。货物保证笺是杨茂林自觉地检查自己的工作的办法。装完车之后，司磅员在一张货物保证笺上填好发站站名、货车号码、装载日期、到站站名等，寄给到站站长。当货物到达目的地时，到站人员卸下货物，就在这个货物保证笺上填好卸车日期、到达情况（有无漏装、错装、装载不满等现象）等项目，寄回给原来发货站的站长。这样，有关方面就能够从货物保证笺上，知道司磅员工作的好坏，和工作好坏的原因。但是，在过去，司磅员装完了车，把车子发出去，就万事大吉了。至于这些货物到达目的地之后，有无错误，是没有人管的。即使有了错误，也不知道是谁装的，应由谁负责。同时，也没有人去研究过去的错误和缺点，找出改进工作的办法。杨茂林制订的货物保证笺，就是为了要使得司磅员认真地负责地装载货物，以便达到满载和无事故的要求。这种货物保证笺不是铁路的法规和规定的制度，也不是处理事故的法律上的重要的凭证，而是杨茂林自动地创立的法规。
    以上所述，就是杨茂林装车法的主要内容。这些内容，说明杨茂林敢于打破常规，勇于找出工作上的缺点，改变了过去盲目的被动的混乱的工作方法，创造了主动的有计划的有步骤的工作方法，这就发挥了车辆的潜在能力，多装了货物，又消灭了事故。杨茂林装车法所以是先进的，其原因就在于此。
    推行杨茂林装车法，是铁道运输部门重要的增产节约的方法。杨茂林在去年十月份装车的数字最有力地说明这个问题。去年十月，杨茂林装出二百一十点五辆车，每辆装了二十六点七吨货物，共装五千六百二十点三五吨货物。如果按照原订标准（即中长铁路管理局的标准，每辆车装十七吨货物）装车，那么，五千六百二十点三五吨货物，需要三百三十点六一辆车才能装出去。这就是说，杨茂林在十月份给国家节省了一百二十点一一辆车。如果按照原订标准，每辆车装十七吨货物，那么，杨茂林十月份在运出的二百一十点五辆车内，只能装出三千五百七十八点五吨货物。换句话说，杨茂林在十月份给国家多装了二千零四十一点八五吨货物。由此很显然地看出：推行杨茂林装车法是有重大意义的，是非常必要的。
    全国铁路由于初步推行了杨茂林装车法，货车装载的质量已经提高。济南铁路管理局推行了杨茂林装车法，因而多装了货物。过去每辆车只装十七点二八吨货物，现在每辆车能装到二十六点七五吨货物。广州南站的司磅员高本锵积极带动全体职工学习杨茂林装车法，装车工作有了显著的进步。去年十二月广州南站每辆车只装二十二点七二吨，今年一月已装到二十五点九二一吨，今年三月提高到二十八点二吨。
    有些车站学习了杨茂林的装载技术，实行配装，大大提高了货车的装载量。锦州车站的工人装载杂货时，把圆形货物与长形货物配装起来，因之创造了棚车每辆装三十点五吨、敞车每辆装三十二点五吨、平车每辆装三十点一吨的最高纪录。许昌车站工人装烟叶，由于改善了装载的方法，每车过去装十四吨，现在提高到二十三吨。
    有些车站的货运员主动地去找货主，说服货主在包装货物时，尽量拧紧，以减小包装的货物的体积。锦州铁路局货运员高延昌、徐成文帮助货主包装洋麻，使每捆洋麻的体积缩小，因之每辆车的装载量由十三吨提高到二十三点五吨。吉林铁路局朝阳镇车站司磅员说服货主，改善了麻袋包装的办法，使每辆车装载量由二十吨提高到三十吨。天津铁路局古冶车站工人过去装焦炭，每辆车只装十八吨；现在学习杨茂林装车法后，改变了装车方法，每车能装到三十三吨了。
    在“三反”运动后，职工觉悟普遍提高，推行杨茂林装车法的政治条件已经成熟。铁道部商务局要求各地认真学习杨茂林装车法，这样，全国铁路正在开展的满载、超轴、五百公里运动才能饱满地向前发展。（附图片）
