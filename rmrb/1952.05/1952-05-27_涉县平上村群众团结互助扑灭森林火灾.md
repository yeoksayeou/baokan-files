    Villagers in Shexian County Unite and Help Each Other to Extinguish Forest Fire
    Editor: There is a large hillside at the junction of Shexian County, Hebei, and Pingshun County, Shanxi. This slope is a protected forest. The side belonging to Shanxi is managed by Huanghua Village in Pingshun County, and the side belonging to Hebei is jointly managed by Pingshang Village and Huangyan Village in Shexian County. This hillside has been a protected forest for nearly ten years, and both sides have managed it well, so the slope is covered with trees. Unexpectedly, after lunch on April 17th, a fire broke out on the side belonging to Shanxi Province. The wind was very strong that day, and if it was not extinguished early, it would spread to the entire slope. At this time, a small number of people in Pingshang Village and Huangyan Village in Shexian County believed that the fire started in Shanxi Province, so there was no need to worry about it on their side; however, the majority of the people believed that all peasants are one family and could not sit idly by. Immediately, county cadre Lü Jinbao, district cadres Liu Yujin and Ji Xiang, and village cadres Wu Minsheng, Xing Chenghui, Huangyan Wu and other comrades persuaded the former group of people and organized a fire-fighting team of 150 people, rushing to the fire area overnight to rescue it, and sent people to Huanghua Village in Pingshun to report and ask for assistance. Later, Huanghua Village also gathered people from three villages to come to the rescue. In this way, the fire-fighting team of about 500 people from five villages in the two provinces surrounded the fire area from all directions and tried their best to put it out. By dawn, the fire was completely extinguished. According to statistics, about 150 mu of forest were destroyed this time. Now the people of the three villages in the two provinces that manage this hillside are even more united. They have made agreements with each other to jointly strengthen management, and have selected special personnel to be responsible for regular inspections, and have also decided to plant new trees in the burned areas.

    涉县平上村群众团结互助扑灭森林火灾
    编辑同志：河北涉县和山西平顺县交界处有个大山坡，这个坡是禁林，靠山西的一边由平顺县黄花村管，靠河北的一边由涉县平上村和黄岩村共管。这个山坡成为禁林已将近十年，两边都保管得很好，所以坡上满山遍野都是树木。不料四月十七日午饭后，靠山西省的那一边着起火来，这天风势很大，如不及早扑灭，势将波及全坡。这时涉县平上村、黄岩村小部分群众认为火起在山西省地界，这边不必管；但大部分群众认为天下农民是一家，不能坐视不管。当下县干部吕金保，区干部刘玉金、冀香，村干部吴民生、邢成会、黄岩武等同志说服了前一种人，组织起一百五十人的灭火队伍，连夜赶赴火灾地区抢救，并派人到平顺黄花村报信求援。后来黄花村也集合了三个村的群众赶来抢救。这样，两省五个村约有五百余人的灭火队，四面包围火区，尽力扑打，到天明完全将火扑灭。据统计，这次共约烧毁林木一百五十余亩。现在两省保管这一山坡的三个村的群众已经团结得更紧，他们相互订约，要共同加强保管，并选出专人负责，经常检查，还决定要在烧毁的地方栽上新树。
