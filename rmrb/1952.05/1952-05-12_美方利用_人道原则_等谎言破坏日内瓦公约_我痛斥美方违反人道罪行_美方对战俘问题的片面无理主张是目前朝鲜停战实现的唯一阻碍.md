Title: The US is undermining the Geneva Convention by using lies such as "humanitarian principles." I denounce the US's inhumane crimes. The US's one-sided and unreasonable demands on the POW issue are the only obstacle to the realization of the Korean armistice.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th. At the Korean armistice talks delegation meeting on the 11th, our representative strongly condemned the other side's shameless lies of so-called "voluntary repatriation," so-called "humanitarian principles," and so-called "screening results." Our representative pointed out: Our side has already made major concessions on the POW issue, and has put forward a completely reasonable compromise plan. Currently, there is only one issue obstructing the realization of the Korean armistice, and that is your side's one-sided and unreasonable demands on the POW issue. Your side has thoroughly undermined the Geneva Convention, violated the lowest standards of human conduct, and taken various barbaric measures against our captured personnel, carrying out fundamentally unacceptable so-called "screening" activities, attempting to forcibly detain our captured personnel under the guise of so-called "voluntary repatriation." Your so-called "humane methods of managing prisoners of war" are in fact "using all necessary force," even resorting to openly taking slaughtering measures, forcing our captured personnel to tattoo, petition, write blood letters, and put fingerprints to fabricate your so-called "screening" results. Your behavior is not only not similar to humanitarian principles, but is the opposite of humanitarianism, directly violating Articles 13 and 14 of the Geneva Convention. Your side shoots hundreds of our unarmed captured personnel every month, and constantly bombs your captured personnel. Your side completely disregards the natural desire of both sides' captured personnel to be repatriated, and systematically creates obstacles to prevent the POW issue from being resolved. The Korean War cannot be stopped, and the POWs on both sides cannot go home. Is this your humanitarianism? The just resistance of our captured personnel to your atrocities has exposed the essence of your so-called "voluntary repatriation" to the people of the world. The delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely and unswervingly opposes your one-sided and unreasonable demands.

    美方利用“人道原则”等谎言破坏日内瓦公约
    我痛斥美方违反人道罪行
    美方对战俘问题的片面无理主张是目前朝鲜停战实现的唯一阻碍
    【新华社开城十一日电】十一日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方代表痛斥对方所谓“自愿遣返”，所谓“人道原则”，及其所谓“甄别结果”的无耻谎言。我方代表指出：我方对战俘问题已经作了重大让步，提出了完全合理的折衷方案，目前只有一个问题阻碍着朝鲜停战的实现，那就是你方对战俘问题的片面和无理的主张。你方彻底破坏了日内瓦公约，违反了人类行为的最低标准，对我方被俘人员采取各种野蛮办法，进行根本不能容许的所谓“甄别”活动，企图假借所谓“自愿遣返”的名义，强迫扣留我方被俘人员。你方所谓“管制战俘的人道办法”，事实上就是“使用一切必要的武力”，甚至不惜公开采取屠杀的手段，强迫我方被俘人员刺字、请愿、写血书、打指印以制造你方所谓“甄别”的结果。你方这种行为，不仅和人道原则毫无相同之处，而正是人道主义的反面，直接违反了日内瓦公约的第十三条和第十四条。你方每月成百地枪杀我方手无寸铁的被俘人员，经常不断地轰炸你方被俘人员。你方根本不管双方被俘人员要求遣返的自然愿望，有计划地制造障碍，使战俘问题不能解决。朝鲜战争不能停止，双方战俘不能回家，难道这就是你方的人道主义吗？我方被俘人员对于你方暴行的正义反抗，向全世界人民揭露了你方所谓“自愿遣返”的实质。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团坚决不可动摇地反对你方的片面无理的主张。
