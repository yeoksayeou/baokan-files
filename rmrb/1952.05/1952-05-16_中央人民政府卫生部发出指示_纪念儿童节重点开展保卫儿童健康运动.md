    Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued instructions to local health administrative organs regarding the focus on launching a movement to protect children's health in commemoration of the "June 1st" International Children's Day.
    The instructions stated: In response to the call of the International Conference for the Defence of Children and to strengthen the patriotic anti-epidemic health movement, this year, in commemorating "June 1st" International Children's Day, all regions should, based on their specific circumstances, focus on launching a movement to protect children's health. The following issues should be noted when carrying out this work: (1) This movement should focus on publicity and education. Disease prevention publicity should primarily focus on defending against bacteriological warfare by American imperialism and acute infectious diseases of children, such as plague, epidemic "type B" encephalitis, cholera, dysentery, measles, smallpox, parasitic diseases, and tuberculosis. New childcare methods should also be appropriately promoted. (2) In areas where conditions permit, health check-ups for children can be organized, with children under the age of seven of the working people as the main target for check-ups. Shortcomings discovered should be rectified as much as possible. (3) When promoting this movement, health authorities should cooperate with relevant departments and people's organizations, and try to mobilize privately practicing health personnel to participate in this work. (4) At the end of this movement, under possible conditions, model mothers and model children's workers can be selected and commended, and experiences should be summarized and reported to the Ministry.
