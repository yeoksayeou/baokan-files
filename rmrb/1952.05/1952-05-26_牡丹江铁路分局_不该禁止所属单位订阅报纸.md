    Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau
    Should Not Prohibit Subordinate Units from Subscribing to Newspapers
    Comrade Editor: Our newspapers are powerful weapons for reflecting reality, exchanging experiences, guiding work, and disseminating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They are the link between the Party, the People's Government, and the masses, and they are our indispensable political nourishment. In every movement and in every task, newspapers play a role in propaganda, encouragement, organization, and leadership. Therefore, newspapers are by no means dispensable reading material. However, some units now fail to pay attention to newspaper reading. They emphasize "economy" and subscribe to fewer or no newspapers. Personnel from various railway departments in Yimianpo, Northeast China, unanimously reported that the Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau does not approve funds for newspaper subscriptions, claiming that it has exceeded the financial plan. The Hengdaohezi Engineering Section even cut back on the one newspaper that more than 70 people at the Yimianpo factory were reading. I believe that such "economy" is wrong and represents a tendency of being unconcerned with politics. I hope that the leading cadres of the Mudanjiang Railway Sub-bureau will promptly examine and correct their errors. I also suggest that units in various localities with similar situations pay attention to this issue.

    牡丹江铁路分局
    不该禁止所属单位订阅报纸
    编辑同志：我们的报纸是反映现实、交流经验、指导工作、传播马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的有力武器，是党、人民政府联系群众的纽带，是我们不可缺少的政治粮食。在每一个运动中，在每种工作上，报纸都起着宣传、鼓舞和组织领导的作用。因此，报纸决不是可有可无的读物。可是，现在有些单位偏偏不重视读报工作，他们强调“节约”，少订或不订报纸。东北一面坡各铁路部门的人员就一致反映：牡丹江铁路分局不批给订报经费，说什么已超过财务计划了。横道河子工务段把一面坡工厂七十多人看的一份报也裁减了。我认为这样的“节约”是不对的，这是一种不问政治的倾向。希望牡丹江铁路分局领导干部从速检查纠正错误；并建议各地有类似这种情形的单位注意这个问题。
