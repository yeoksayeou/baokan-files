    To Visit Tianjin, Shanghai, and Other Places

    Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The Central South Nationalities Institute visiting group, a party of 172 people, left Beijing on May 8th to visit Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. The visiting group arrived in Beijing on April 25th. They participated in the May Day International Labor Day celebrations and the May Fourth Youth Day commemorative activities in the capital; at the May Day celebration rally, they sent a representative to present a flag to Chairman Mao to pay their respects. During their stay in Beijing, they received a warm welcome from all walks of life. They visited schools, factories, and other construction projects and historical sites in the capital, and attended a banquet hosted by Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Vice Chairman Liu Geping.

    The members of the visiting group are all students from the Central South Nationalities Institute, including young people from eleven ethnic groups in the Central South region, such as Yao, Miao, Li, Dong, and Hui. After more than half a year of political study, their thinking has improved significantly, and they love the great motherland and Chairman Mao. On May Day, they were extremely excited to see Chairman Mao.

    When the visiting group left Beijing, they wrote a letter to the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, saying: This visit to the capital has shown us that the various construction undertakings of the motherland are developing rapidly, which makes us recognize the glorious, splendid, happy and fulfilling future of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland.

    The letter stated: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been liberated. Today, we not only have the opportunity to study, but also have the honor to visit the capital, where we are welcomed everywhere. The Han elder brothers love us like relatives. What moves us most is that the gray-haired old grandmothers and the three- to five-year-old children warmly applaud and welcome us when they see us. The young brothers and sisters patiently teach us to dance and sing. This unprecedented national unity makes us deeply appreciate the warmth and happiness of living in the big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups.

    The letter concluded by saying that under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will definitely work harder to study, transform our thinking, strengthen national unity, learn from the Han elder brothers, improve our patriotism and internationalism, strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and fight to the end to defend and build the great motherland.

    When the visiting group left Beijing, they also wrote a letter to thank the people of all walks of life in the capital.
