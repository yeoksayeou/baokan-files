Struggle to Implement Mao Zedong's Line on Literature and Art

    To Be a Cultural Vanguard Under the Banner of Mao Zedong for a Long Time
    Guo Moruo
    Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in May 1942 is a specific application and development of Marxist-Leninist literary theory in the practice of Chinese literary and artistic work. Literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; revolutionary literary and art workers must stand on the proletarian standpoint, move the Marxism-Leninism in books to the masses, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, become familiar with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thereby representing the workers, peasants, and soldiers, encouraging the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and educating the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that literature and art become a component part of the entire revolutionary machine. Under the determination of this fundamental direction, many contradictory issues with differing opinions are given a very satisfactory dialectical unity. Such as the unity of popularization and improvement, the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, the unity of class love and class hatred, the unity of praising the bright side and exposing the dark side, the unity of motive and effect... thoroughly solving many historical problems that have existed in the Chinese literary and art circles and in general literary theory since the May Fourth Movement, thus enriching the content of Marxist-Leninist literary theory.
    Literary and art workers who have been to Yan'an or other base areas, having received such earnest instructions from Chairman Mao, and due to the objective conditions of the revolutionary base areas making this revolutionary literary theory easy to practice, coupled with individual subjective efforts, many friends have made very good contributions to literature and art, to the revolution, and to the people. The people's literature and art, which has flourished for ten years with Yan'an as its birthplace, is not only welcomed by the people at home, but also by international friends. This clearly proves the correctness and universal adaptability of the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao.
    Literary and art workers who have not been to Yan'an are unfortunately restricted, just like a flower planted in the shade of a wall that has not seen the sun. In those years, literary and art workers active in the Kuomintang reactionary ruling areas, all those with a progressive consciousness yearned for the revolutionary sacred place of Yan'an. Some people came into contact with "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and consciously engaged in practice, but in the reactionary areas, it was very difficult to get close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers. If the object remains unchanged, and the life remains unchanged, then the quality of literature and art will not change much. This is a limitation on objective conditions. There are also limitations on subjective conditions, that is, the bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, and feudal ideologies stubbornly restrict writers in various degrees from adopting a fundamental shift in their positions. Chairman Mao had long said that "to completely solve this problem, it will take ten or eight years." Today, ten years have passed, but many people, including myself, have not completely solved this problem. This does not mean that Chairman Mao underestimated the difficulties, but rather that our subjective efforts to overcome the difficulties are really not enough. It takes ten or eight years for those who work hard to overcome them; wouldn't it take a longer time, or even drag the problem into the grave, for those who don't work hard to overcome them?
    In July 1949, three years ago, the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers was held in Beijing, which was a grand meeting of the nation's literary and art workers. At the congress, the representatives unanimously raised their hands to accept the literary and artistic direction indicated in Chairman Mao's "Talks." Friends who are willing to follow this direction and work hard have achieved success. For example, in the patriotic movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, a part of the literary and art workers are playing an effective role, producing many excellent works. But generally speaking, our literary and artistic achievements still cannot meet the requirements of reality. Compared with the rapid progress in military, political, and economic construction, our pace seems even more backward. Regardless of which department of literature and art, or which aspect of creation, criticism, theoretical teaching, or administrative leadership, there is the same phenomenon of stagnation. As a result, erroneous or reactionary literary and artistic works are able to circulate in the market. The fact that the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which promotes slavish education and distorts revolutionary history, could be produced, screened, and even praised on a fairly wide scale can be simply said to be a "frantic attack of bourgeois ideology" on the literary and artistic front.
    Now is the era when the people are the masters, the era when the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance is being implemented. There are no longer any objective conditions of reactionary regimes that can be used as excuses. We have no one to blame but ourselves, our subjective efforts are not enough, our thinking is numb and paralyzed, we have not seriously learned Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and we have not seriously "moved our butts over." The criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" launched by the CPC Central Committee served as a wake-up call, which made everyone somewhat awakened. Last November, the Beijing literary and art circles, as the vanguard of the country, launched a rectification and study movement to rectify literary and artistic thought and improve leadership work, which was completely necessary and timely. This study movement, and the ideological reform movement in the educational and scientific circles, were launched at about the same time, one after the other, and then the nationwide Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements were launched. After such a large-scale ideological reform study, the ideological numbness and paralysis of a part of the people should have hope of being revived.
    Ideological reform is a long-term and arduous struggle. Although the centralized movement can come to an end, the transformation process of each individual and the entire society, like all metabolic mechanisms, can never be stopped. The cessation of the metabolic mechanism means corruption, which means death. We are not willing to be corrupted, and we are not willing to become corpses while alive. The only way out is to constantly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly put them into practice, transform thought into action, and promote the lively vitality of thought from action.
    "China's revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle, to the only broadest and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the processing process, that is, the creative process, thus unifying the raw materials and production, the research process and the creative process."
    Chairman Mao's call to us ten years ago is still loud and clear today, and will be loud and clear for a long time to come. -- At most, only "class" will cease to exist. We must do this, and then we can earnestly transform our thinking, stand firm, and transform our class; and only then can we truly "have promise," and have achievements in research and creation. If we don't do this, Chairman Mao warned us as early as ten years ago, and we will get such a result:
    "Otherwise -- Chairman Mao said -- your labor will have no object, no raw materials or semi-finished products, and you will have nothing to process. You can only be the kind of empty-headed writer or empty-headed artist that Lu Xun repeatedly instructed his son not to be in his will."
    This warning is very real, and I myself am a very appropriate proof. I am also a literary and artistic worker, who used to engage in creation and criticism, and today I am also responsible for literary and artistic administration, but for more than two years, it can be said that I have achieved nothing. The reason is that I have been separated from the masses and separated from life. I have not "gone to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to the fiery struggle," so I have lost the source of creation, and I have no raw materials or semi-finished products to process.
    Cultural workers who come from the nurturing of the old society, whether they are writers, scientists, or educators, are generally have the same appearance, style, and tendencies, just like brothers and sisters from the same womb. Literary and art workers despise workers, peasants, and soldiers, despise popularization work, and are detached from the masses and from reality. Most scientists and educators also despise workers, peasants, and soldiers, despise popularization work, and are detached from the masses and from reality. Although the Talks at the Yan'an Forum are limited to the theoretical aspects of literature and art, they can be applied to scientific research and education work in many ways. Whoever despises workers, peasants, and soldiers, and whoever despises popularization work, is detached from the masses and detached from reality.
    Friends, please be vigilant! I myself have felt apprehensive for a long time. I very much hope that I can constantly reform myself and thoroughly "change from one class to another." "To completely solve this problem, it will take ten or eight years." Starting from today, let's have another "ten or eight years." As long as there is a breath of life, I will always be vigilant, constantly study, constantly transform myself, and constantly improve my work.
    I want to work hard to strive to be a cultural vanguard under the banner of Mao Zedong for a long time.

### 在毛泽东旗帜下长远做一名文化尖兵

专栏：为贯彻执行毛泽东文艺路线而斗争

    在毛泽东旗帜下长远做一名文化尖兵
    郭沫若
    毛泽东主席一九四二年五月“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”是马克思列宁主义的文艺理论在中国文艺工作实际中的具体的运用和发展。文艺必须为工农兵服务，革命的文艺工作者必须站在无产阶级的立场，把书本上的马克思列宁主义移到群众中去，学习工农兵，熟悉工农兵，从而表现工农兵、鼓舞工农兵、教育工农兵，使文艺成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分。在这个根本方向的确定之下，使许多意见分歧的矛盾问题得到很美满的辩证的统一。有如普及和提高的统一、政治和艺术的统一、内容和形式的统一、阶级友爱和阶级仇恨的统一、歌颂光明和暴露黑暗的统一、动机和效果的统一……透彻地解决了“五四”以来在中国文艺界中、在一般文艺理论中所存在着的许多历史性的问题，因而使马克思列宁主义的文艺理论获得了很充实的内容。
    已经到过延安或其它根据地的文艺工作者，得到毛主席这样剀切的指示，由于革命根据地的客观条件使这革命的文艺理论容易实践，更加上个人的主观的努力，有不少的朋友对于文艺、对于革命、对于人民是有了很好的贡献的。十年来以延安为发祥地蓬勃发展起来的人民文艺，不仅受着国内人民的欢迎，而且也受到国际友人的欢迎。这就明确地证明着毛主席所指示的文艺方向的正确性和普遍适应性。
    没有到过延安的文艺工作者不幸地是受着限制了，这犹如栽在墙阴里的花没有见到太阳。当年在国民党反动派统治区域里面活动着的文艺工作者，凡有前进意识的人都是憧憬着革命圣地延安的。“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”有一部分人是接触到了，也有意识从事实践，但在反动区域里面，接近工农兵是很困难的。对象不变，生活不变，因而文艺的品质也就没有多少改变。这是客观条件上的限制。还有主观条件上的限制，便是资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想和封建思想在各种不同程度上的顽强性限制着作家们采取立场上的根本转换。毛主席已早就说过“要彻底解决这个问题，非有十年八年的长时间不可”。今天已经十年了，然而很多的人，我自己也包含在内，并没有把这个问题彻底解决。这并不说明毛主席对于困难的估计有些过低，而是说明我们克服困难的主观努力实在是太不够。努力克服的人要十年八年，不努力克服的人岂不是要更长远的时期，甚至要把问题一直拖进坟墓里去吗？
    三年前的一九四九年七月，全国文学艺术工作者代表大会在北京召开，这是全国文艺工作者的大会师。在大会上代表们一致举手接受了毛主席“讲话”中所指示的文艺方向。肯遵循这个方向而努力的朋友是有成就的。如在抗美援朝的爱国运动中，一部分的文艺工作者正发挥着有效的作用，产生了不少的优秀作品。但从一般来说，我们的文艺成就还不能满足现实的要求。如果和军事、政治、经济等各方面突飞猛进的建设工作比较起来，我们的步调就更显得落后。不问是文学艺术的那一部门，也不问是创作、批评、理论教学、行政领导的那一方面，都有同样的停顿现象。结果就使错误的或反动的文艺作品得以销行于市场，像鼓吹奴化教育、歪曲革命史实的电影“武训传”之能摄制、放映、甚至受到相当广范围内的称赞，简直可以说是在文艺战线上的“资产阶级思想的猖狂进攻”了。
    现在已经是人民作了主人的时代，已经是实行着由工人阶级领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的时代，再没有什么反动政权的客观条件的限制可以作为藉口了。责无旁贷，只能怪我们大多数人的主观努力不够，怪我们的思想麻痹、瘫痪、没有认真学会马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，没有认真“把屁股移过来”。经过中共中央所发动的对于电影“武训传”的批评，连撞警钟，这才使得大家有些憬然觉悟了。去年十一月下旬北京文艺界作为全国的先导发动了整风学习运动，用以整顿文艺思想、改进领导工作，是完全必要而适时的。这一学习运动、和教育界与科学界的思想改造运动，略有先后地在同一时期内发动了起来，而紧接着又发动了全国范围的三反五反运动。经过这样大规模的思想改造的学习，一部分人的思想麻痹症、思想瘫痪症，应该是有起死回生的希望了。
    思想改造是一种长期性的艰剧斗争。集中性的运动虽然可以告一段落，但每一个人的和整个社会的改造过程却和一切的新陈代谢机构一样是永远不能中止的。新陈代谢机构的中止就意味着腐化，意味着死亡。我们是不甘心腐化，不甘心活着便成为死尸的，唯一的出路便是经常学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，而不断地移诸实践，把思想化而为行动，从行动中促进思想的活泼泼的生机。
    “中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样地把原料与生产，把研究过程与创作过程统一起来。”
    十年前毛主席所给予我们的号召，今天依然是声音琅琅的，将来也会长远地声音琅琅的。——至多只是“阶级”不会存在而已。我们必须照着这样做，然后才能使思想得到认真的改造，把立场站稳，把阶级转换过来；也才能够真正“有出息”，有研究上和创作上的表现。要是不照着这样做，毛主席也早就在十年前警告过我们了，我们就会得到这样的结果：
    “否则——毛主席说——你的劳动就没有对象，没有原料或半制品，你就无从加工，你就只能做鲁迅在他的遗嘱里所谆谆嘱咐他的儿子万不可做的那种空头文学家或空头艺术家。”
    这警告是十分真切的，我自己就是一个很适当的证明。我自己也是一个文艺工作者，以前既曾从事创作，也曾从事批评，而今天又担负着文艺行政的责任，但两年多来可以说是毫无成绩的。原因就由于我脱离了群众，脱离了生活。我没有“长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”，因而我失掉了创作的源泉，没有可以加工的原料和半制品了。
    从旧社会的薰陶中出来的文化工作者，不管是文艺家、科学家、教育家，就如从同一娘胎里出来的兄弟姊妹一样，大抵有同样的面貌，作风和倾向。文艺工作者轻视工农兵、轻视普及工作、脱离群众、脱离实际，科学家教育家们也大多数轻视工农兵、轻视普及工作、脱离群众、脱离实际。延安座谈会上的讲话，虽然是限于文艺理论方面的，但在许多问题上对于科学研究、教育工作，同样可以适用。谁要是轻视工农兵、轻视普及工作，谁就是脱离群众、脱离实际。
    朋友们，请提高警惕吧！我自己是很久以来便感觉着惶恐的。我很希望能够不断地进行改造，彻底地“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”。“要彻底解决这个问题，非有十年八年的长时间不可”，从今天做起，就再来个“十年八年的长时间”吧。只要一息尚存，我总要不断地警惕，不断地学习，不断地改造自己，不断地改进自己的工作。
    我要努力争取，在毛泽东旗帜下长远做一名文化尖兵。
