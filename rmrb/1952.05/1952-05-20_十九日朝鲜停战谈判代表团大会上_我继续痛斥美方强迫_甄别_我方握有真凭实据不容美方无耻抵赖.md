Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: At the plenary session of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation on the 19th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out that the fact now before the people of the world is that, despite the barbaric methods you have adopted against our captured personnel, raping their will, our captured personnel would rather die than submit to your forced detention. The other party still attempts to deny the undeniable fact that our captured personnel would rather die than submit to the other party's forced detention. General Nam Il sternly questioned: "Is it not a fact that our captured personnel, unable to tolerate your abuse and murder, risk collective slaughter to make just demands to you? Is it not a fact that your prisoner-of-war camp officers assured our captured personnel that they would no longer engage in criminal activities that violate the Geneva Convention? Is it not a fact that you disregarded the Geneva Convention, violated the lowest standards of human conduct, inflicted various atrocities on our captured personnel, and even resorted to massacre? Is it not a fact that your prisoner-of-war camp officers assured our captured personnel that there would be no more forced screening?" The other party was speechless and avoided answering. General Nam Il's main speech at the 19th session was as follows:

"No matter what methods you use, you cannot save the bankruptcy of your so-called 'voluntary repatriation' proposal. No matter what methods you use, you cannot cover up the fact that you are attempting to forcibly detain our captured personnel. You have attempted, and are still desperately attempting, to use the myth that our captured personnel refuse repatriation to increase your capital for expanding the war. But your affairs have not been handled well, and your secrets have been seen through by the world. Everyone knows that for a long time, you have used Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang and Li Seung-man's secret agents to threaten our captured personnel with various barbaric methods and force them to refuse repatriation. You do not hesitate to resort to bloody massacres to achieve your despicable goals. You have not yet accounted for the two cases of massacre of our captured personnel on February 18th and March 13th. In order to help you achieve the goal of detaining our captured personnel, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang has repeatedly ordered its secret agents to force our captured personnel to adopt the method of writing petitions in blood, and even fabricate their adoption of announcing collective suicide to create the so-called anti-repatriation movement. We have conclusive evidence of these facts. Your activities of adopting various barbaric methods in an attempt to forcibly detain our captured personnel have in fact reached a point where they cannot be concealed and cannot be denied. Your former prisoner-of-war camp officers publicly admitted that you adopted various acts of violence to forcibly screen our captured personnel in an attempt to detain them as your cannon fodder. Your new prisoner-of-war camp officers publicly stated that you will continue to subject our captured personnel to inhumane treatment, forcibly screen them, and detain them as your cannon fodder. In order to strengthen your bloody violent rule over our captured personnel, you have recently mobilized a large number of troops to the location of your prisoner-of-war camps to further suppress the just resistance of our captured personnel.

The fact now before the people of the world is that despite the barbaric methods you have adopted against our captured personnel, raping their will, our captured personnel would rather die than submit to your forced detention. You dare not face this fact. In order to cover up this fact, you have created the myth that our captured personnel do not want to be repatriated. In fact, when your prisoner-of-war camp officers publicly admitted to the world that you forcibly screened our captured personnel, your myth had already been completely shattered and can never deceive anyone again.

We firmly oppose your detention of our captured personnel and any screening for the purpose of detaining our captured personnel. It is inconceivable and no one would believe that we, who firmly oppose your detention of our captured personnel in any name, would directly or indirectly agree to your so-called screening. The problem now is that you insist on the one-sided and unreasonable demand to detain our captured personnel at the cost of not wanting an armistice in Korea. If you do this, the families of tens of thousands of prisoners of war on both sides and peace-loving people all over the world will curse you. In order to negotiate a solution to the problem on a reasonable basis, we have put forward a reasonable compromise plan on May 2nd, which is the only reasonable basis for solving the problem."

    十九日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    我继续痛斥美方强迫“甄别”
    我方握有真凭实据不容美方无耻抵赖
    【新华社开城十九日电】十九日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出，现在摆在全世界人民面前的事实是：尽管你方对我方被俘人员采取如此野蛮办法，强奸他们的意志，但我方被俘人员宁死不屈于你方强迫和扣留的暴力之下。对方犹图抵赖我方被俘人员宁死不屈于对方强迫扣留的不容抵赖的事实，南日将军严词质问：“难道我方被俘人员不能容忍你方的虐杀而甘冒遭受集体屠杀的危险，向你方提出正义要求不是事实吗？难道你方战俘营长官向我方被俘人员保证不再进行违反日内瓦公约的罪恶活动不是事实吗？难道你方不顾日内瓦公约，违反人类行为的最低标准，对我方被俘人员施行各种暴行，甚至采取屠杀的手段不是事实吗？难道你方战俘营长官向我方被俘人员保证不再有强迫甄别不是事实吗？”对方无词以对，避不答复。南日将军在十九日大会上主要发言如下：
    “不管用什么办法，你们也不能挽救你们的所谓‘自愿遣返’主张的破产。不管用什么办法，你们也不能掩盖你们企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员的事实。你们企图过，而现在仍然绝望地企图着用什么我方被俘人员拒绝遣返的神话来加强你们扩大战争的资本。但是你们的事情并没有做好，你们的秘密已被世人所识透。谁都知道长时期以来，你们就利用蒋介石匪帮和使用李承晚特务，用各种野蛮的手段来威胁我方被俘人员，强迫他们拒绝遣返。你们不惜采取血腥屠杀的手段来实现你们的卑鄙目的。你们对于二月十八日和三月十三日两次屠杀我方被俘人员的案件还没有交代。蒋介石匪帮为了帮助你们实现扣留我方被俘人员的目的，曾经几次命令他的特务人员强迫我方被俘人员采用写血书来请愿的办法，甚至捏造他们采用宣布集体自杀的办法来制造所谓拒绝遣返的运动。这些事实我方握有真凭实据，你方采取各种野蛮手段，企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员的活动，事实上已经到了无从掩盖和不容抵赖的程度。你方前任战俘营长官公开承认你方采取各种暴力行为，强迫甄别我方被俘人员，企图扣留他们充当你方炮灰。你方新任战俘营长官公开表示你方还将继续对我方被俘人员施行非人道待遇，强迫甄别他们、扣留他们充当你方炮灰。为了加强你方对我方被俘人员的血腥暴力统治，你方最近又调动了大量部队到你方战俘营的所在地，进一步镇压我方被俘人员的正义抗争。
    现在摆在全世界人民面前的事实是尽管你方对我方被俘人员采取如此野蛮办法，强奸他们的意志，但我方被俘人员宁死不屈于你方强迫扣留的暴力之下。你方不敢面对这个事实。为了掩盖这个事实，你方制造出我方被俘人员不愿遣返的神话，其实当你方战俘营长官向全世界公开承认你方强迫甄别我方被俘人员的时候，你方的这种神话早已被彻底粉碎永远不能再骗人了。
    我们坚决反对你方扣留我方被俘人员及以扣留我方被俘人员为目的的任何甄别，不可能设想也没有人会相信坚决反对你方以任何名义扣留我方被俘人员的我方会直接或间接同意过你方的所谓甄别。现在的问题是你方不惜不要朝鲜的停战而坚持扣留我方被俘人员的片面无理主张。你们这样做，双方千万战俘的家属和全世界爱好和平的人民都会咒诅你们。为了在合理基础上协商解决问题，我们已经提出了五月二日合理的折衷方案，这是解决问题的唯一合理的基础。”
