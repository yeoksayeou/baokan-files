    ▲ The Shanghai Workers' Political School officially opened on May 9th. Shu Tong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Liu Changsheng, Third Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, and Principal of the Workers' Political School, all attended the opening ceremony.

    The Shanghai Workers' Political School will rotate workers from factories and enterprises into the school for study, systematically improving their political level in a planned way. The first group of over 1,000 students are all worker activists drawn from state-owned factories after the Democratic Reform and the "Three-Anti" Movement, and have been carefully mobilized and recommended by the masses of each factory. The content of the study mainly concerns the education of the working class, communism, and the Communist Party. After the study, the students will have a clearer understanding of the working class's current position, future goals, and the basic relationship between the working class and the Communist Party. The learning method basically adopts the combination of theory and practice, repeated education from concrete to principle and from principle back to concrete, and the combination of inspiring reports, group discussions, seminars, recollection, complaining, typical introduction, and summaries.

    ▲ In the past year, the spare-time education for staff and workers in Jiangxi Province has developed rapidly. According to statistics from six cities, seventy counties, and seven industrial units, the number of staff and workers participating in spare-time learning in the province has reached 65,201, an increase of six times compared with the end of 1950 and a doubling compared with the first half of 1951. All major cities and more than 20 counties and towns in the province have successively formulated illiteracy elimination plans. Nanchang, Shangrao, Ganzhou, Jingdezhen, Yushan, Yongxiu, and other places have also trained a large number of mass teachers, solving part of the teacher problem for the future spare-time education of staff and workers. This year, in addition to planning to strive for 100,000 staff and workers to participate in spare-time learning, preparations are also being made to universally establish staff and worker spare-time middle schools in major cities throughout the province to meet the workers' demands for further study.

    ▲ The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries will jointly hold "Tchaikovsky Commemoration" music evenings on the 17th, 18th, 20th, 24th, and 25th of this month. The program includes Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony Second Movement, Italian Capriccio, selections from the opera "Eugene Onegin," and other programs.
