(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th) At the sixteenth session of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation today, our chief representative, General Nam Il, sternly pointed out that the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" of the other side has been declared completely bankrupt under the firm and just resistance of our captured personnel. The fact that the commanders of the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps have confessed to the world irrefutably proves that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" and the so-called "screening and re-screening" are merely tricks to forcibly detain our captured personnel and use them as cannon fodder. Since "screening" itself is absurd and cannot be tolerated, no conditions can make it reasonable and tolerable. We firmly oppose the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" and any "screening or re-screening" based on it. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

After the cessation of hostilities, the unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war is the only reasonable principle for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. It is a clear provision of all international law, a right that cannot be deprived of by either side's prisoners of war, and an obligation that cannot be evaded by either side's commanders. The principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" is itself absurd and untenable, and the "screening" based on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle is itself intolerable. "Screening" prisoners of war is fundamentally a violation of all laws of war and international law, and a violation of the clear provisions of the Geneva Convention. Your side has systematically used the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Lee Seung-man special agents for a long time, using various forms of violence against our captured personnel, in an attempt to create the so-called "screening results." However, all your atrocities cannot shake the unwavering will of our captured personnel to return home and live peaceful lives. Under the firm and just resistance of our captured personnel, your side's absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" has been declared completely bankrupt. The fact that your prisoner-of-war camp负责人 have confessed to the world irrefutably proves that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" and the so-called "screening" are merely tricks to forcibly detain our captured personnel and use them as your cannon fodder. Today, when your absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" has been completely bankrupted in the face of overwhelming facts, you have once again put forward the old tune of so-called "joint re-screening" in "absolutely peaceful conditions" within the demilitarized zone, attempting to salvage your bankrupt absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation." It should be pointed out that this desperate struggle of your side will not help you in the slightest, because anyone can see that since prisoner-of-war "screening" itself is absurd and cannot be tolerated, then no conditions can make it reasonable or tolerable. You are trying to get us to accept, in effect, your absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation," to rationalize and legitimize your so-called "screening" activities, and to "verify" the so-called "screening results" that you have fabricated. Your logic of asking people to first agree to your criminal principles in order to prove that your crimes are not crimes cannot deceive anyone.

Since the fourth agenda item began to be discussed, our side has consistently and firmly opposed the absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" and any "screening or re-screening" based on it. Our consistent position on this issue does not allow for any distortion. The facts no longer allow your side to continue to insist on your one-sided and unreasonable demands, which have been completely bankrupted. Our proposal of May 2nd is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. If your side is truly interested in achieving a Korean armistice, you have no reason to continue to delay the negotiations and refuse to accept our reasonable compromise proposal. Right and wrong cannot be reversed. For two weeks, it has been your side that has been adopting an unreasonable, non-negotiating, and refusal-to-discuss attitude at this meeting, attempting to force our side to accept your aide-mémoire. It is very clear that the responsibility for delaying the negotiations rests entirely with your side. We firmly reject your one-sided and unreasonable proposal of April 28th. It is absolutely necessary for our side to expose the absurdity of your unreasonable proposal based on facts and logic, and to explain the reasonableness of our proposal. As long as your side does not change this barbaric attitude and abandon your unreasonable proposal, our side will continue to expose the absurdity of your proposal at this meeting. Since you insist on your absurd demands, you cannot escape the consequences that inevitably arise from your insistence. The so-called "screening" is fundamentally absurd and cannot be tolerated. Your so-called "screening results" are doubly absurd and fabricated out of thin air. Your prisoner-of-war camp负责人 have already announced to the world the complete bankruptcy of your claims. Since "screening" itself is absolutely intolerable, there can be no conditions that make it legitimate or reasonable. The Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that prisoners of war must not be denied repatriation, and that so-called "screening" activities must not be conducted on prisoners of war. Your side is attempting to tear up the Geneva Convention and carry out your criminal activities in another guise. However, our side will never cooperate, nor will any truly just organization be willing to cooperate. We firmly oppose your absurd principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" and any form of "screening and re-screening" based on it. We have been working hard at this meeting to展开 discussion and seek a solution to the problem based on the reasonableness of our proposal. Unless your side formally announces the termination of the armistice negotiations, you have no reason to oppose the normal conduct of the meeting. It is the obligation of both sides to come to the meeting, so we suggest that we continue the meeting at the usual time tomorrow.

     在十六日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    南日将军斥美方罪恶的甄别阴谋
    严词指出：在我被俘人员的正义反抗下
    美方“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则彻底破产
    【新华社开城十六日电】十六日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军严词指出：在我方被俘人员的坚决和正义的反抗下，对方的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则已被宣告彻底破产。对方战俘营营长向全世界招供的事实，无可争辩地证明了所谓“自愿遣返”、所谓“甄别与重新甄别”只是强迫扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的诡计。既然“甄别”本身就是荒谬的，不能被容许的，也就没有任何条件可以使它成为合理的，可被容许的。我方坚决反对所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则和以此为基础的任何“甄别或再甄别”。南日将军主要发言如下：
    敌对行为终止后，无条件遣返全体战俘是解决战俘问题的唯一的合理原则，是一切国际公法的明文规定，是双方战俘所不容剥夺的权利，是双方司令官所不容逃避的义务。所谓“自愿遣返”的原则本身就是荒谬的，不能成立的，以所谓“自愿遣返”原则为基础的“甄别”，本身就是不能容许的。对战俘进行“甄别”，根本就是违反了一切战争法规和国际公法，违反了日内瓦公约的明确规定。你方长时期以来有计划的利用蒋介石匪帮和使用李承晚特务，对我方被俘人员使用各种暴力，企图制造所谓“甄别的结果”，但你方一切暴行都不能动摇我方被俘人员归返家园过和平生活的不可动摇的意志。在我方被俘人员的坚决和正义的反抗下，你方所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则已经被宣告彻底破产。你方战俘营负责人向全世界招供的事实无可争辩地证明了所谓“自愿遣返”、所谓“甄别”只是强迫扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰的诡计。在你方所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则已经在压倒的事实面前彻底破产的今天，你方却再次提出了所谓在“绝对和平的条件下”，在非军事地区内进行“共同重新甄别”的老调，企图以此来挽救你方已经破产了的“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则。应该指出你方这种绝望的挣扎一点也不能帮助你们，因为谁都可以看出，既然战俘“甄别”本身就是荒谬的，不能被容许的，那么也就没有任何条件可以使它成为合理的、可被容许的。你们企图要我们事实上接受你方所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，来使你方的所谓“甄别”活动合理化和合法化，来“证实”你方所捏造的所谓“甄别结果”。你们这种要人家先同意你们的罪恶原则，以证明你们的罪行并非罪行的逻辑是骗不了任何人的。
    自从第四项议程开始讨论以来，我方一直坚决反对所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则和以此为基础的任何“甄别或再甄别”。我方在这一问题上的一贯立场不容许任何曲解。事实已经不容许你方继续坚持你方已经彻底破产的片面无理的主张。我方五月二日的方案是解决战俘问题的唯一的合理基础。如果你方真正有意于达成朝鲜停战，你方没有任何理由继续拖延谈判、拒绝接受我方的合理折衷方案。是非是不容颠倒的。两个星期以来，是你方在这一会上一直采取了不讲理、不协商、拒绝任何讨论的态度，企图以此强迫我方接受你方的哀的美顿书。很清楚，拖延谈判的责任完全在于你方。我们坚决拒绝你方四月二十八日的片面无理的方案。我方根据事实与逻辑暴露你方无理方案的荒谬性，并说明我方方案的合理性，这是完全必要的。只要你方有一天还不改变这种横蛮的态度并放弃你方的无理方案，我方就将继续在这一会上暴露你方方案的荒谬性。你们既然坚持你们的荒谬主张，你们就不能逃脱你们这种坚持所必然产生的后果。所谓“甄别”根本就是荒谬的，不能容许的。你方所谓“甄别结果”更是双重荒谬的，凭空捏造的。你方战俘营负责人已经向全世界宣布了你方主张的彻底破产。既然“甄别”本身就是绝对不能容许的，就不可能有任何条件使之合法、合理。日内瓦公约明确规定不得拒绝遣返战俘，不得对战俘进行所谓“甄别”活动。你方企图撕毁日内瓦公约，用另外一种花样来进行你方的罪恶活动。但我方决不会奉陪，也决不会有任何真正公正机构愿意奉陪。我方坚决反对你方所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则及以此为基础的任何形式的“甄别与再甄别”。我们一直在这一会上努力展开讨论，寻求在我方方案的合理基础上解决问题。除非你方正式宣布终止停战谈判，你们就没有理由反对会议的正常进行。前来开会是双方的义务，因此我们建议明天通常时间继续开会。
