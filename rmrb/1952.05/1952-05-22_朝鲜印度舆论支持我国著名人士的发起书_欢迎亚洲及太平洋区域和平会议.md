Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 21st: Korean public opinion warmly welcomes the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing. "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 20th titled "Korean People Warmly Welcome the Initiation of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," stating: Under the current international situation, holding the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is an important step in defending world peace. American imperialism is currently doing its utmost in the Far East to foster Japanese militarism, delay the Korean armistice negotiations, and continue its aggressive war against Korea in a frenzied manner, launching large-scale germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. At the same time, British imperialism is also continuing its bloody war against the Malayan people, and French imperialism is still conducting its seven-year-long war of aggression against Vietnam. These atrocities have put the people of Asian and Pacific regions in danger of a new war. However, the peace-loving people of the Asian and Pacific regions are convinced that the danger of a new war can be eliminated. The existence of the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a powerful guarantee for the victory of the people of Asian and Pacific regions in their struggle to defend peace and national independence. As long as the people of all countries correctly estimate their unity, rise up to defend peace and national independence with a firm belief in victory, then peace in the Asian and Pacific regions will surely be maintained, and the war adventures of the imperialists will be thoroughly shattered. The editorial said: The Korean people warmly welcome the call by prominent Chinese peace fighters to jointly initiate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and are determined to fight to the end for the freedom and independence of their motherland and to defend world peace and security.

    "Democratic Korea" published an editorial on the 19th, pointing out: After the eleven famous Chinese peace warriors called for the initiation of the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference" on March 21st, it quickly received a warm response from peace-loving people in Asian, Australian, and American Pacific coastal countries. All Korean people firmly support and endorse this call. The editorial then said: The American imperialists have suffered a fatal blow in the nearly two-year-long war of aggression against Korea, but they have not abandoned their aggressive ambitions and their ambition to dominate the world. The American aggressors' conspiracy to expand a new war has put the people of the Asian and Pacific regions in danger of suffering armed aggression again. However, what the masses of people in the Asian and Pacific regions demand is not war but peace. Today, in any country along the Asian and Pacific coast, the strength of the masses of people opposing new wars and demanding peace is growing. The famous Chinese peace warriors pointed out in their initiation letter: "Peace cannot wait, peace requires the unity of peace-loving people to strive for it." We should unite the enormous peace forces that have developed in various countries along the Asian and Pacific coast under one banner and resolutely oppose the American imperialists' rearmament of Japan. The editorial concluded: The Korean people firmly support the initiation of this conference and are deeply convinced that the convening of this conference will be another demonstration of the unity of the people of the world.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st: The Bombay "Blitz Weekly" published an article titled "The Dawn of Peace Appears in the East; Peace Advocates All Yearn for Beijing, the Site of the Great Gathering of All Asia," commenting on the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, saying: "This conference will be an unprecedented manifestation of striving for peace and striving for Asian unity. Honest and wise activists will gather together to discuss taking various steps to curb the wars and conflicts currently underway in Asia, and to eliminate the threat of armed aggression facing the people of Asian and Pacific regions." The commentary also stated: "The people of Asian and Pacific regions must unite against the United States' rearmament of Japan in order to defend the security of Asia; oppose one country's interference in the internal affairs of another country in order to defend the independence, integrity, and sovereignty of all countries, and ensure that countries with different systems can coexist peacefully; firmly advocate the peaceful settlement of existing disputes in order to restore and develop normal trade relations and cultural exchanges between countries. This conference will be the beginning of large-scale mutual exchanges of cultural delegations between Asian countries. This conference will be the beginning of renewed efforts to break down economic barriers and establish trade relations to develop the Asian economy. This conference will be the beginning of a great, unified peace movement in the two major regions of Asia and the Pacific, which has become an important factor in defending world peace. Asia is about to raise its voice, declaring its love of peace and its determination to stop the wars and conflicts currently underway in Asia, thereby preventing the threat of world war." In discussing the preparations being made by India and other Asian countries for this conference, the commentary stated: All Asian countries will conduct the same preparatory work for this conference. At the same time, the campaign to collect signatures for the declaration demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact will be intensified. Every Indian who loves peace and freedom should participate in India's preparations for the Asian peace conference. Everyone should organize peace conferences in his own city, village, or region. The Indian delegation to Beijing should be a true representative of the millions of Indians from all walks of life and with various viewpoints. The commentary concluded by emphasizing: "Now is the time to start spreading the news of the Asian conference, the news of peace, unity, and freedom, throughout Asia. If united in the struggle for peace, the people of Asia can stop the war."

    欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜舆论界热烈欢迎在北京举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。“劳动新闻”在二十日发表题为“朝鲜人民热烈欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的发起”的专论说：在目前的国际形势下，召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议是保卫世界和平的重要步骤。美帝国主义目前正在远东竭力扶植日本军国主义，拖延朝鲜停战谈判，疯狂地继续进行侵朝战争，向朝鲜和中国人民发动了大规模的细菌战。同时，英帝国主义也在继续进行反对马来亚人民的血腥战争，法帝国主义仍在进行其已有七年的侵越战争。这些暴行使得亚洲及太平洋区域各国的人民面临着新战争的危险。但是亚洲及太平洋区域爱好和平的人民确信：新战争的危险是可以消除的。伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国的存在，就是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民保卫和平及民族独立斗争取得胜利的有力保障。各国人民只要正确估计自己的团结，以坚强的胜利信心奋起保卫和平与民族独立，那么亚洲及太平洋区域的和平就一定能够维护，帝国主义者的战争冒险必将被彻底粉碎。专论说：朝鲜人民热烈欢迎中国著名的和平斗士们关于共同发起亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的号召，决心为争取祖国的自由独立以及保卫世界和平与安全而斗争到底。
    “民主朝鲜”十九日发表社论指出：中国的十一位著名的和平战士，在三月二十一日号召发起“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”之后，迅即得到亚洲、澳洲、美洲太平洋沿岸各国广大爱好和平人士的热烈响应。全朝鲜人民坚决支持和赞同这一号召。社论接着说：美帝国主义者在将近两年的侵朝战争中已经遭到致命的打击，但是它还没有放弃其侵略企图和称霸世界的野心。美国侵略者扩大新战争阴谋，已使亚洲及太平洋区域的人民面临重新遭受武装侵略的危险。但是，亚洲及太平洋地区的人民群众所要求的决不是战争而是和平。今天，在亚洲及太平洋沿岸的任何国家，人民群众反对新战争要求和平的力量正日益增长着。中国著名的和平战士们在发起书中指出：“和平绝不能等待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。”我们应该把在亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国发展起来的巨大的和平力量，团结在一个旗帜下，坚决反对美帝国主义者重新武装日本。社论最后说：朝鲜人民坚决支持这一会议的发起，并深信这一会议的召开将成为全世界人民团结的又一个示威。
    【新华社新德里二十一日电】孟买“闪电周报”发表题为“东方出现了和平的曙光；和平拥护者都向往着全亚洲的伟大集会的所在地——北京”的文章，评论将要召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议说：“这次会议将是争取和平、争取亚洲团结的空前盛大的表现。诚实智慧的行动家们将齐集在一起讨论采取种种步骤，以遏止目前正在亚洲进行的战争和冲突，消除亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民面临的武装侵略的威胁。”评论又说：“亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民必须团结起来反对美国重新武装日本，以捍卫亚洲的安全；反对某一国家干涉另一国家的内政，以捍卫各国的独立、完整与主权，并保证不同制度的国家能够和平共存；坚决主张以和平方式解决现有的争端，以恢复并发展各国间的正常贸易关系和文化交流。这个会议将是亚洲各国大规模互派文化代表团的开端。这个会议将是重新努力打破经济障碍和建立贸易关系以发展亚洲经济的开端。这个会议将是已经成为保卫世界和平的重要因素的亚洲和太平洋两大区域的伟大、统一的和平运动的开端。亚洲将要发出它的声音，宣布它对和平的热爱和它要制止目前正在亚洲进行的战争和冲突从而防止世界大战威胁的决心。”评论在谈到印度及其他亚洲国家为这次会议所做的准备工作时说：所有的亚洲国家都将为这次会议进行同样的准备工作。和这同时，为要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言征集签名的运动将要加紧进行。每一个爱好和平与自由的印度人都应参加印度为亚洲和平会议所做的准备工作。每一个人应该在他自己的城市、乡村或地区组织和平会议。前往北京的印度代表团应该是各个阶层和各种观点的千百万印度人民的真正代表。评论最后强调说：“现在就应该开始向亚洲各地散布亚洲会议的音讯，散布和平、团结与自由的音讯了。如果团结起来争取和平，亚洲人民是可以制止战争的。”
