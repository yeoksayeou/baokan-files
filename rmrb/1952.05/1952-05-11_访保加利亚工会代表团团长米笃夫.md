An interview with Ivan Vassilev Mitov, head of the Bulgarian Trade Union Delegation who was invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations:

No matter which country it is, the existence of fascism will cause serious damage to the national economy.

After being liberated from the shackles of fascism, the Bulgarian people, with the decisive help of the Soviet Union, and under the leadership of the Dimitrov Bulgarian Communist Party tempered by war, bravely and confidently embarked on the road of socialist construction.

The nationalization of industry, banks, and large agricultural implements laid the foundation for the planned development of the national economy.

After successfully completing the National Economic Two-Year Plan of 1947-1948, the Bulgarian working people saw industrial development reach pre-war levels, and in some respects, greatly exceed them. The Bulgarian working people then enthusiastically began to implement the first Dimitrov Five-Year Plan. Labor productivity is increasing day by day, production is increasing daily, the cultural level of the working people is improving, and their welfare is growing.

In 1951, the total industrial output increased by 19% compared to 1950, which was four times that of the pre-war period. The electricity production in 1951 alone was equal to the total output of the five years before the war. New industrial sectors have been established, such as the chemical industry and the machine manufacturing industry. The average wage of industrial workers increased by 8.2% in 1951, and in some sectors, such as the chemical industry and other industries, it exceeded 20%.

New industrial enterprises with a total value of 92 billion leva were put into operation in 1951, including the Stalin Chemical Plant, the Chervenkov Thermal Power Plant, the Kolarov Reservoir, and many other industries.

Dimitrovgrad is the product of the vigorous Bulgarian-Soviet friendship and a model of a large industrial center. The chemical fertilizers produced by the Stalin Chemical Plant have been applied to agriculture in the most remote corners of Bulgaria. This chemical fertilizer has led to new and significant increases in crop yields. In addition to the Stalin Chemical Plant, one can see the huge buildings of the largest cement factory in the Balkans, "Vulcan," and many other factories.

The entire country and all the people are immersed in a creative upsurge. Just the following fact is enough to illustrate this: almost 80% of the workers participated in socialist emulation, and they all undertook specific labor responsibilities. These achievements, this creative enthusiasm and upsurge, are the guarantee for completing and overfulfilling the 1952 production plan, which increased by 24% compared to 1951.

Relying on their achievements, Bulgarian workers are full of determination to achieve new victories on the labor front. They assured Comrade Chervenkov that they would complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in four years, and they are gloriously fulfilling their promise. For example, the workers of the Voroshilov Power Plant overfulfilled the plan for the first quarter of 1952 by 19%, although this plan already exceeded the 1951 plan by 70%.

The Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian People's Government take fatherly care of the needs and rest of the working people. For example, in the first year after Bulgaria's liberation (1945), 4,900 workers were sent to sanatoriums and rest homes, while in 1951, 168,000 people rested in the best resorts in the country, which workers never dared to dream of. All working people in the country—regardless of their profession, ethnicity, or political beliefs—can enjoy free medical treatment.

In 1951, the National Assembly passed the Labor Code. All issues related to labor rights, as well as issues of rest, social security, insurance, and relief funds, were reviewed and stipulated in this code. The Labor Code is one of the greatest victories of the working class. What is particularly important is that the implementation and application of this code is undertaken by the workers themselves, by their trade union organizations.

According to the provisions of the Code, all expenses related to social security and social insurance are borne by the enterprises. Workers do not have to pay any dues related to social security or deductions from their salaries. Workers who reach a certain age and have a certain length of service are entitled to receive relief funds regardless of whether they have paid relief fund dues before or after the enactment of the current code.

In case of illness, workers can receive an amount based on a sick leave certificate that is practically equivalent to 90% of the average factory wage of the month before their illness.

In the past, although there were provisions in the law to give workers paid leave, only a very small number of workers enjoyed this right. Now, all workers can enjoy the treatment of at least 14 days of paid leave per year without exception; and in some industrial sectors and workshops with unhealthy and heavy work, the duration of this leave is stipulated to be 30 days or even more.

Agriculture in Bulgaria is developing along with the development of industry, construction, and transportation. 53.3% of Bulgaria's total agriculture has joined agricultural production cooperatives, which account for 52% of the country's arable land area, and in some grain-producing areas, it accounts for as much as 90% of the arable land. The degree of mechanization of agriculture is increasing day by day. The number of machine tractor stations serving agricultural production cooperatives was 90 in 1950 and reached 115 in 1951. Due to the mechanization of agriculture and the adoption of the world's most advanced Soviet agricultural technology, soil improvement, and some other measures, agricultural yields and productivity have increased, and the income of members of agricultural production cooperatives has also increased. Agricultural production in 1951 increased by 42.9% compared to 1950, and this increase in yields was mainly achieved by relying on agricultural production cooperatives and state farms rather than relying on individual economies. The state supply and sales plan for agricultural products was completed in a timely and smooth manner in 1951, in which agricultural production cooperatives and state farms had to undertake more than 60% of the task of implementing the entire plan. This fact once again emphasizes the leading and decisive role of new socialist labor organizations in agriculture.

These remarkable achievements, unprecedented in the history of Bulgaria, are the result of the heroic labor of the Bulgarian people, first and foremost the result of the selfless and ever-increasing assistance of the great Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin himself, and the result of the wise leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party and its Central Committee and Comrade Chervenkov himself.

The people of Bulgaria have achieved the above-mentioned achievements with their peaceful labor. Therefore, they can stand firmly in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and are prepared to cooperate with all the nations of the world to defend the interests of peace.

    访保加利亚工会代表团团长米笃夫
    应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的保加利亚工会代表团长伊凡·瓦西列夫·米笃夫对记者发表谈话如下：
    无论哪一个国家，只要有法西斯主义存在就会给国民经济以严重的损害。
    保加利亚人民在从法西斯桎梏中解放出来以后，就在苏联决定性的帮助下，在受过战争锻炼的季米特洛夫保加利亚共产党的领导下，勇敢地和自信地走上社会主义建设的道路。
    工业和银行以及大农具的收归国有，奠定了有计划的发展国民经济的基础。
    保加利亚劳动人民成功地完成了国民经济一九四七—一九四八年的两年计划以后，工业的发展达到了战前的水平，而且在某些方面，大大超过了战前水平。保加利亚劳动人民又热诚地开始执行第一个季米特洛夫的五年计划。劳动生产率一天天地提高，生产品逐日地增加，劳动人民的文化水平在提高，他们的福利增长着。
    一九五一年工业生产品的总量比一九五○年增加了百分之十九，四倍于战前。仅一九五一年的电力生产量就和战前五年产量的总和相等。新的工业部门建立起来了，如化学工业、机器制造业等。工业工人的平均工资，在一九五一年增加了百分之八·二，某些部门，例如化学工业和其他工业则超过了百分之二十。
    一九五一年拥有九百二十亿列夫总值的新工业企业开了工，其中包括斯大林化学工厂，契尔文科夫火力发电厂，科拉罗夫蓄水池和许多其他工业。
    季米特洛夫格勒是蓬勃发展的保加利亚——苏联友谊的产儿，是大工业中心的典范，斯大林化学工厂生产的化学肥料，已应用在保加利亚最辽远的角落的农业中。这种化学肥料使农产品的收获量有了新的和显著的增加。除斯大林化学工厂外，可以看到巴尔干半岛上最大的水泥工厂“火山”和其他许多工厂的巨大建筑。
    整个国家和全体人民都投入创造性的高潮中。只须举下列这一件事即可说明这一点：几乎百分之八十的工人都参加了社会主义竞赛，而且他们都承担起具体的劳动责任。这些成就，这种创造性的热情和高潮，就是完成和超额完成比一九五一年增加了百分之二十四的一九五二年的生产计划的保证。
    保加利亚工人依靠着自己的这些成就，充满了决心，要在劳动战线上达到新的胜利。他们向契尔文科夫同志保证以四年时间来提前完成五年计划，并且他们正光荣地实现着自己的诺言。例如，伏罗希洛夫电力工厂的工人，超额完成了一九五二年第一季计划的百分之十九，虽然这个计划已比一九五一年的计划超过了百分之七十。
    保加利亚共产党和保加利亚人民政府父亲般地关怀劳动人民的需要和休息。例如，保加利亚解放后第一年（一九四五年）把四千九百名工人送到休养所和疗养所去，而在一九五一年，在工人从来不敢梦想的国家最好的疗养地，有十六万八千人在休养。国内全体劳动人民——不论他们的职业、民族和政治信仰如何，都能享受到免费医疗的待遇。
    一九五一年国民会议通过了劳动法典。所有有关劳动权利问题以及休息、社会保障、保险和救济金的问题，都在这一法典中得到审查并且作了规定。劳动法典是工人阶级的一个最大的胜利品。而特别重要的是，这一法典的实施和运用，是由工人自己，由他们的工会组织来担任的。
    依照法典的规定，所有有关社会保障和社会保险的支出都是由各个企业负担。工人不必缴纳任何和社会保障有关的会费或扣除薪金。工人在达到一定年龄以后，而在具有一定的工龄时，则不管他们在现行法典通过前或通过后是否交纳过救济金会费，都可以有权领取救济金。
    遇有疾病时，工人们可以根据病假证获得实际上相当于他病前一个月的工厂平均工资的百分之九十的金额。
    过去，虽然法律中也有给工人以带薪例假的规定，但却只有极少数的工人享有这种权利。现在，全体工人都可以无例外地享有每年至少十四天的带薪例假的待遇；而在一些有损健康和工作很繁重的工业部门和车间中，这种例假的期限则规定为三十天或者还多一点。
    保加利亚的农业在伴随着工业、建筑和运输业的发展而发展。保加利亚全部农业的百分之五十三·三都加入了农业生产合作社，后者占有全国可耕土地面积的百分之五十二，而在一些谷物产区，它所占有的可耕土地甚至达到百分之九十。农业的机械化程度在逐日提高着。为农业生产合作社服务的机器拖拉机站在一九五零年时有九十所，到一九五一年已经达到一百一十五所。由于农业的机械化和采用了世界最先进的苏联农业技术、土壤改良和一些其他的措施，农业的收获量和生产率增加了，提高了，农业生产合作社的社员们的收入也增加了。一九五一年的农业生产比一九五零年提高了百分之四十二·九，而这种收获量的增加，主要是依靠农业生产合作社和国家农场而不是依靠个体经济获得的。农产品的国家供售计划在一九五一年已被及时地和顺利地完成，其中农业生产合作社和国家农场曾不得不担负了执行全部计划的百分之六十以上的任务。这一事实再度强调说明了在农业中新的社会主义的劳动组织形式的领导和决定性作用。
    这些卓越的、在保加利亚的历史上未曾有过的成绩，是保加利亚人民的英勇劳动的结果，首先是伟大的苏联和斯大林同志自己无私的和不断增强的帮助的结果，是光荣的保加利亚的共产党及其中央委员会以及契尔文科夫同志本人的英明领导的结果。
    保加利亚的人民用他们的和平劳动获得了上述的成绩。因此，他们能够坚强地屹立于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营中，并准备和世界所有的民族合作来保卫和平的利益。
