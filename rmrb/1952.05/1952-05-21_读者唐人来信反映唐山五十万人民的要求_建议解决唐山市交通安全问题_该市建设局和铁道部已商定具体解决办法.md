To the Editor: I want to tell you about the traffic safety problem of 500,000 citizens in Tangshan City (the majority of whom are workers) and ask for your assistance in solving it. Tangshan is a long and narrow industrial and mining city running from southwest to northeast, and the Jing-Shan Railway line runs right through the city. The section of the railway from Tangshan Station to the north end of Fuxing Road in the urban area is ten *li* long (it's Tangshan's commercial district, with a high population density), and there are five crossings in between. The only crossing that can accommodate large trucks and larger horse-drawn carts is the gate at the south end of Jianguo Road, but because more than sixty trains pass through every day (each train requires the gate to be closed for fifteen to twenty minutes; if trains pass continuously, the gate is closed for half an hour to an hour or more), the gate is closed for longer than it is open, causing frequent traffic jams and extreme chaos. The tunnel passages at the north entrance of Fuxing Road and Shuangqiaoli are too narrow and too low, allowing only small jeeps and smaller horse-drawn carts to pass one-way, and car collisions and car-pedestrian accidents occur frequently. The only unobstructed passage for pedestrians is the overpass at the north end of Jiefang Road, but during the Lantern Festival last year, a large number of people gathered on the overpass due to the other gates being closed for too long, resulting in a serious incident in which thirty-three people were trampled to death (this matter has been dealt with, and the People's Daily also reported it).

With only five narrow passages for the ten-*li* long railway running through the city's commercial district, coupled with the frequent closure of the gates, not only are accidents likely to happen at any time, but it also creates great difficulties in transportation. Take my situation as an example: I live north of the railway and have to go to work south of the railway every day. Because I often encounter closed gates, I have to leave an hour or half an hour early to rush to work or take a detour of two or three *li* and pass through the overpass. There are many workers in similar situations.

The railway branch lines of various factories and mines connected to the Jing-Shan line also run through the city. For example, dozens of branch lines and forks leading to the Qixin Cement Plant, the Steel Plant, the Power Plant, the Huaxin Yarn Factory, the Stone Company, and the Northwest Mine and Kiln Support Plant of the Kailuan Coal Mine pass through densely populated areas of the city, and these railways have almost no protection facilities, or the protection facilities are very poor. Train accidents causing death are no longer new to the people of Tangshan. People say, "The trains in Tangshan run all over the streets, and you never know when something might go wrong!" There are so many railway crossings in the city, and some of the gaps in the tracks are wide, so livestock often break their legs or overturn and hit people (for example, at the east gate crossing of the Qixin Cement Plant, livestock broke their legs almost every day last year; the track gap at this crossing has been narrowed, but there are many places where it has not been narrowed yet). Many farmers cry loudly by the roadside because they rely on livestock to earn a living!

Since Liberation, we have repeatedly reported this problem to the Municipal People's Government and the railway authorities. Although the government has strengthened the management of traffic order and renovated the Shuangqiaoli tunnel passage, the fundamental problem has not been solved. We also understand that moving a railway is not an easy task, but this issue of urban traffic safety for 500,000 people should be appropriately improved at present.

Tang Ren

Editor's Note: Reader Tang Ren's letter suggests improving traffic safety in the urban area of Tangshan City. This newspaper sent someone to investigate the urban area of Tangshan and confirmed that the situation reflected by Tang Ren is completely true; the people of Tangshan are very eager to solve this problem.

According to our understanding: The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government and the Tangshan Municipal People's Government originally planned to move the railway in the urban area of Tangshan to the suburbs, but because the railway branch lines of the city's factories and mines are closely connected to it, the relocation project is huge; the city's urban area is also expanding, and the prosperous area will also move accordingly, so this plan cannot be realized. However, in order to solve this major problem, the City Construction Bureau has now jointly decided with the Ministry of Railways to deepen and widen the tunnel passage at the north end of Fuxing Road so that large trucks and horse-drawn carts can pass side by side (pedestrians can also pass). This project is scheduled to start in July this year. Next year, a large tunnel passage will be built near Tangshan Station. At the same time, the Construction Bureau is looking for a location to add one or two pedestrian passages. In terms of strengthening the protection of railway branch lines of various factories and mines: Kailuan Coal Mine has set up wire mesh protection in dangerous sections where the railway passes; the protection facilities of other factory and mine railways are also being negotiated for resolution.

    读者唐人来信反映唐山五十万人民的要求
    建议解决唐山市交通安全问题
    该市建设局和铁道部已商定具体解决办法
    编辑同志：我要把关系唐山市五十万市民（绝大部分是工人）的交通安全问题告诉你们，请求你们协助解决。唐山是一座从西南向东北的狭长形的工矿城市，京山线铁道正好横穿市区而过。从唐山车站到复兴路北头的市区铁道，全长计十华里（是唐山的商业区，人口密度很大），其间共有通行道口五个。唯一可以通行大型卡车和容量较大的马车的，是建国路南头的闸口，但由于每天通行的火车在六十趟以上（每趟车需关闭闸门十五分钟至二十分钟，如果连续通行火车的话，则关闭在半小时至一小时以上），每天闸门关闭时间较开放时间还多，因此造成了交通经常阻塞和极度混乱现象。复兴路北口和双桥里的地洞通道过窄过低，只能供小型吉普车和容量较小的马车单行，经常发生车碰车、车碰人的事情。行人唯一可以通行无阻的是解放路北头的天桥通道，但去年元宵节因其他闸门关闭时间太长，天桥上聚集大量往来人群，造成了三十三人被挤踏而死的严重事件（这件事已经处理，人民日报也登过）。
    横穿全市商业区十里长的铁道，只有五个窄狭的通道，加之闸门经常关闭，这不但随时可能发生事故，同时也造成了交通上很大的困难。以我的情况来说吧，我家住在铁道以北，每天要到铁道以南去上工，因经常碰见关闭闸门的事情，我就不得不提早一小时或半小时抢道上班，或者绕道两三里，走天桥通过。类似我这样情况的工人是很多的。
    与京山线相连的各厂矿铁道支线，也是贯穿市区而过。比如：通启新洋灰厂、钢铁厂、发电厂、华新纱厂、石头公司以及开滦煤矿西北井、窑柱厂的数十条支线叉道，都是经过人口很密的市区，而这些铁道几乎是毫无防护设备，或防护设备很差。火车轧死人，在唐山人民的心中已经不是什么新鲜的事情。群众都说：“唐山的火车是满街跑，说不定那会儿要出毛病啊！”市区铁路的道口这样多，有些轨道的缝隙又宽，因此常发生牲畜蹩断腿或翻车碰人的事（像启新洋灰厂东门道口在去年几乎是每天发生牲畜蹩断腿的事，这个道口的轨缝已经改窄，但没有改窄的地方还很多），许多农民为此在道旁放声大哭，因为他们就指望牲畜赚钱来生活啊！
    解放以来，我们曾多次向市人民政府和铁路方面反映过这个问题，政府虽然加强了对交通秩序的管理和翻修了双里桥地洞通道，但根本问题还是没有解决。我们也曾想到，要迁移一条铁道不是一件轻而易举的事，但这件有关五十万人口的城市交通安全问题，在目前是应该得到适当的改善的。唐人
    编者按：读者唐人来信建议改善唐山市区的交通安全问题，本报曾派人前往唐山市区进行调查，证实唐人所反映的情况完全真实；唐山市民要求解决这一问题的心情是十分迫切的。
    据我们了解：中央人民政府铁道部和唐山市人民政府原计划把唐山市区铁道移至郊区，但由于该市工厂、矿山的铁道支线和它紧密相连，移道工程巨大；该市市区又正在扩展，繁华区亦将随之迁移，所以这一计划不能实现。但该市建设局为了解决这一重大问题，现已和中央铁道部共同决定：把复兴路北头的地洞通道加深加宽，使大型卡车和马车可以并行（行人亦可通行）。这项工程定今年七月间动工。明年则在唐山车站附近另辟一大型地洞通道。同时，建设局正在觅寻地址，加辟一个或两个行人通道。在加强各厂、矿铁道支线防护方面：开滦煤矿已在铁道通行的危险地段，设立铁丝防护网；其他工厂、矿山铁道的防护设备亦在商洽解决中。
