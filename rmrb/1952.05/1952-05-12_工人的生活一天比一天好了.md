    Workers' Lives Are Getting Better Day by Day
    Dear Editor: I was extremely excited when I heard the news that the Tianjin Railway Bureau was building 1,700 worker dormitories in Wangchuanchang, Tianjin. In the past, reactionaries always schemed and squeezed every drop of profit from the workers; the employees' food and clothing were a problem, not to mention housing. After liberation, the workers stood up, and their lives are getting better day by day. We don't have to worry about food or clothing. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the prices of daily necessities have generally decreased, and our actual income has increased. Now, our "housing" problem is also being solved. This shows how meticulously the People's Government is taking care of our employees' lives.
    The People's Government attaches great importance to this construction project. Everyone was asked to look at the model beforehand and give their opinions. The buildings are tall and spacious with good lighting. The government also plans to build schools, hospitals, and sports fields for us successively. How happy the workers are in the era of Mao Zedong! I will definitely repay the care of the People's Government with practical actions, vigorously promote the fully loaded, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movement in my work post, improve the quality of statistics, play a supervisory role, eliminate false reports, and eliminate waste.

### 工人的生活一天比一天好了

    工人的生活一天比一天好了
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局在天津王串场建筑一千七百间工人宿舍的消息传来后，我兴奋极了。过去反动派总在工人身上打算盘、挤油水；职工的衣食还成问题，更谈不到住了。解放后，工人翻了身，生活一天比一天好，不愁吃，也不愁穿。经过“三反”“五反”运动，日用百货的价格普遍降低，我们的实际收入又增加了。现在，我们“住”的问题也要解决了。这说明人民政府是如何无微不至地在照顾着我们职工的生活。
    人民政府对这个建筑工程是极其重视的，事先叫大家看了模型，提出意见。建筑的房屋高大宽敞，光线很好。政府还计划陆续给我们建筑学校、医院和运动场。毛泽东时代的工人多幸福啊！我一定以实际行动来报答人民政府的关怀，在我的工作岗位上，努力推动满载、超轴、五百公里运动，提高统计质量，发挥监督作用，消灭伪报，消灭浪费。
    郭中霞
