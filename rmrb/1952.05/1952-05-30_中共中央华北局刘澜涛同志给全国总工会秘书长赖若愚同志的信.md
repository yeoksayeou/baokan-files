Comrade Ruoyu:

Zhang Shunyou, a cart driver from Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, reported the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude in Guihua City, traveling back and forth between 27 organizations in the three provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, for nearly half a year, covering a distance of more than 15,000 li, and finally arrested the counter-revolutionary element. This kind of spirit of hating counter-revolutionary elements and upholding justice is worthy of praise. However, in this heroic action of his, he encountered obstacles from many bureaucratic officials and saboteurs in various organizations. We have decided to investigate them one by one. After several talks with relevant personnel here and Zhang himself, and four telephone calls with the Public Security Bureau of Guihua City, the Public Security Bureau of Yanggao County, Chahar Province, and an exchange of views with people from the Public Security Bureau of Guihua City, it has been proven that Zhang Shunyou's account of the situation is basically correct. This exposes that the bureaucratic work style of many organizations in Suiyuan, Chahar, Shanxi and other places has reached an intolerable level of seriousness. In order to thoroughly investigate this matter, we have decided to send people to various departments in the relevant provinces and cities to check the facts clearly. Then we will transfer all responsible party members of the various organizations involved in this case to the North China Bureau for inspection, and publicly publish the inspection results and Zhang Shunyou's oral materials for criticism, in order to educate cadres and the masses.

The travel expenses of 2.4 million yuan incurred by Zhang Shunyou have been temporarily advanced by the North China Bureau, and Zhang Shunyou has been introduced to take the money home for production. Zhang wrote after returning home expressing great satisfaction with this solution. I hereby inform you.

    中共中央华北局刘澜涛同志给全国总工会秘书长赖若愚同志的信若愚同志：
    山西省崞县赶车工人张顺有，为检举归绥市反革命分子宋郁德，往返察、绥、晋三省二十七个机关，为时几达半载，行程一万五千余里，终于逮捕了该反革命分子。此种仇恨反革命分子和坚持正义的精神值得表扬。但在他这一英勇行动中，曾遭受到许多机关官僚主义者和破坏分子的阻碍，我们已决定逐一加以检查。经此间有关人员和张本人数次谈话及与归绥市公安局、市法院、察哈尔省阳高县公安局四次电话联系，并和归绥市公安局来人交换意见的结果，证明张顺有所述情况基本上是正确的。这暴露了绥远、察哈尔、山西等地许多机关，官僚主义作风已达到不可容忍的严重程度。为彻底查清此事，我们已决定派人前往有关省市各部门查对清楚后，即调所有与此案有关的各机关负责的党员来华北局进行检查，并将检查结果及张顺有口述材料予以公开发表，加以批判，以教育干部和群众。
    张顺有往返所花路费二百四十万元，暂由华北局垫支，并已介绍张顺有带款回家生产。张回家后来信对如此解决甚为满意。特告。
