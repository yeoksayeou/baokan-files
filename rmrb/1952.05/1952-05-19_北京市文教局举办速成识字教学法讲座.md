To widely promote accelerated literacy education among workers, peasants, and citizens in the city, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education held a lecture on the accelerated literacy teaching method from May 13th to 16th to train necessary teachers. More than 900 people attended the lecture, including cultural and educational cadres from various districts and trade unions in the city, cadres from various cultural centers, and full-time teachers of workers', peasants', and citizens' spare-time education in the city. The trainees listened to reports on the basic theory and teaching process of the Qi Jianhua accelerated literacy method, and the experience report of the Gaobeidian Cultural Center in the suburbs of Beijing on experimenting with the accelerated literacy method among farmers. They also watched an exhibition and slides introducing the accelerated literacy teaching method. After three days of study, the trainees generally understood the basic spirit of the accelerated literacy method and mastered the basic teaching methods. They all expressed confidence in promoting it.

Since January, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has successively opened more than 20 experimental classes in Gaobeidian and other places, and has gained relatively complete teaching experience. In order to further use the accelerated literacy method to eliminate illiteracy in the city, the Bureau of Culture and Education has decided to select key areas in the Shijingshan, Mentougou and other industrial and mining areas, various districts in the city, and rural areas in the suburbs to conduct large-scale experiments on the accelerated literacy method. This decision has been warmly supported by workers, peasants, and citizens throughout the city. Currently, 150,000 workers, more than 90,000 peasants, and citizens in Beijing are participating in the study, and they will all gain literacy in the short term.

    北京市文教局举办速成识字教学法讲座
    北京市人民政府文教局为在全市工农及市民群众中广泛推行速成识字教育，在五月十三日至十六日举办了一个速成识字教学法讲座，以培养必要的师资。参加听讲的有全市各区及各工会文教工作干部、各文化馆的干部，以及全市工农和市民业余教育的专任教员共九百多人。参加讲座的学员们听了关于祁建华速成识字法的基本理论和教学过程的报告，和北京市郊区高碑店文化馆在农民中实验速成识字法的经验的报告，并看了介绍速成识字教学法的展览会和幻灯。参加讲座的学员们经过三天的学习，一般都认识了速成识字法的基本精神并掌握了教学的基本方法。他们都表示有信心加以推广。
    北京市人民政府文教局从一月起就先后在高碑店等处开办实验班二十余处，取得了较完整的教学经验。为了更进一步地应用速成识字法扫除全市文盲，文教局已决定在石景山、门头沟等工矿区，市内各区和郊区农村中选择重点大规模试验速成识字法。这一决定受到全市工农及市民群众的热烈拥护。北京市现有十五万工人、九万多农民和市民参加学习，他们都将在短期内获得读写能力。
