Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The confessions of American airmen Inak and Quinn, captured by the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, regarding the crimes of bacteriological warfare committed by the American military, pierce like a sword the faces of the American aggressors attempting to deny their crimes of bacteriological warfare. After U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered a shameless speech on May 7th, attempting to conceal their embarrassing situation, a speech which was refuted thoroughly, from Tokyo to Washington to Western Europe, whether habitual liars among American officials or the lackeys of the U.S. who follow their master's orders, faced with this irrefutable evidence, they had to shut their mouths. On the 16th, the "Joint Investigation Team of Korean and Chinese Expert Journalists" released to the people of the world a report on the team's interrogation of Inak and Quinn, further providing evidence of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare. The American aggressors were even more tight-lipped and dared not say a word about Inak and Quinn's confessions.

When Inak and Quinn's confessions were published, the American aggressors, in their panic, still attempted to deny them, but this denial was so shameless, so clumsy, and so full of contradictions. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's speech at a press conference on May 7th is proof of this. He painstakingly extracted statements from Inak and Quinn's confessions that denounced the American warmongers, "asserting that no two people in the entire U.S. Air Force would voluntarily make such statements," attempting to negate the two confessions in one fell swoop. But people pointed out that the long-tongued Acheson did not dare to quote, and selectively deleted, a passage from Inak and Quinn's confessions, in which they explained how, under the influence of the Chinese People's Volunteers' policy towards prisoners of war, they came to realize that their real enemies were the Wall Street warmongers, and frankly confessed the process of their awakening to the crimes of bacteriological warfare committed by the American aggressors. Thus, Acheson's only and weak basis, along with his lies, collapsed.

The American aggressors also tried to use the more despicable method of tampering with the confessions to deny the evidence of American bacteriological warfare revealed in the confessions. A dispatch from Los Angeles by the United Press International on the 7th maliciously tampered with our broadcast, saying: "The Communists broadcast that Lieutenant Quinn admitted to attending a bacteriological warfare school in Japan last August." The dispatch then quoted what was said to be Quinn's wife as saying: "My husband did not go overseas until last November, and in August, we were still together at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia." UPI attempted to use such an extremely shameless lie to rebut our broadcast of the confession as a "lie." However, as long as one checks Quinn's confession published by us, one can see that the liar is precisely the American aggressor himself. Quinn's confession stated: "I first reported to Langley Air Force Base on August 25, 1951... I stayed there for eight weeks and then was sent to Camp Stoneman to wait for departure... We left the United States by plane and arrived at Haneda Air Station in Japan on November 27, 1951..." Quinn's confession broadcast by us said that he heard the bacteriological warfare course on December 18, 1951, at Kunsan Air Base in Korea. It never said that he "attended a bacteriological warfare school in Japan last August." Therefore, the words of Quinn's wife quoted by UPI not only failed to negate the confession, but also proved the accuracy of Quinn's confession broadcast by us. The lies fabricated by UPI using this shameless method backfired and further exposed the panicked and embarrassed ugly state of the American aggressors in the face of the accusations of this powerful evidence, as well as their despicable, dirty, and unscrupulous hooligan face.

The more one wipes the ashes, the blacker they become. Any quibbling and denial of the facts by the American aggressors can only further expose their criminal face. Now, the American aggressors are silent about Inak and Quinn's confessions precisely because the evidence is so strong, exposing all the lies of the American aggressors, that they dare not even mention a word now. And the American accomplices, who spare no effort to exonerate the American masters from the crimes of bacteriological warfare, are equally silent this time. This is clearly because they have received the order from their embarrassed American masters to remain silent, so as not to embarrass themselves further and fall into a more unfavorable situation.

However, silence cannot save the American aggressors either. The "silence" of the American aggressors and their accomplices precisely proves their embarrassed predicament of being helpless in the face of so much irrefutable evidence; it proves that all the quibbling and denials they made in the past were all complete and utter lies.

### 对美国战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词  美国侵略者噤若寒蝉不敢狡辩

    对美国战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词
    美国侵略者噤若寒蝉不敢狡辩
    【新华社二十四日讯】被朝中人民军队俘获的美国空军人员伊纳克和奎恩所供认的关于美国军队进行细菌战的罪证，像利剑一样，戳破了企图抵赖进行细菌战罪行的美国侵略者的面皮。在美国国务卿艾奇逊五月七日发表了一篇妄想掩盖其狼狈面目的无耻谈话而该谈话被驳斥得体无完肤之后，从东京到华盛顿到西欧，无论是惯于撒谎抵赖的美国官方人物，或者是唯主子之命是从的美国的帮凶们，面对着这一不可辩驳的证据，都不得不闭口缄默。十六日，“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”向全世界人民公布了该团讯问伊纳克和奎恩的报告书，进一步提供了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证。美国侵略者更是噤若寒蝉，对伊纳克和奎恩的供词，连一句话都不敢讲。
    当伊纳克和奎恩的供词被发表后，美国侵略者在慌乱之余，仍妄图抵赖，但这种抵赖是如此无耻、如此拙劣而又如此矛盾百出。五月七日，美国国务卿艾奇逊特别在记者招待会上发表的那篇谈话，就是证明。他费尽心计，取出伊纳克和奎恩供词中斥责美国战争贩子的语句，“断言美国整个空军部队中决没有两个人会自愿发表这样的话的”，企图一口否定这两篇供词。但是人们指出，长舌者艾奇逊没有敢引证而且断章取义地删掉了伊纳克和奎恩在供词中的一段话，他们在那段话中说明了他们在中国人民志愿军的俘虏政策的感召下怎样认识了他们的真正敌人乃是华尔街的战争贩子，并坦白了美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行的觉醒过程。于是，艾奇逊的唯一的也是软弱无力的根据连同他的谎话一起破产了。
    美国侵略者也曾经想用更卑劣的篡改供词的方法，来否定供词中揭发出来的美国进行细菌战的罪证。美国国际新闻社七日自洛杉矶发出的消息，曾恶毒地篡改我方的广播说：“共方广播说奎恩中尉承认去年八月在日本的细菌战学校上课。”该消息于是引述据说是奎恩的妻子的话说：“我的丈夫在去年十一月才赴海外，在八月间，我们还一起在弗吉尼亚州的兰格利基地。”国际新闻社企图用这样极端无耻的谎话反噬我方所广播的供词为“谎言”。但是，人们只要一查我方所公布的奎恩的供词，就可以看出说谎者正是美国侵略者自己。奎恩的供词说：“我于一九五一年八月二十五日先到兰格利空军基地报到……我在那里待了八个星期，然后被送往史东曼兵营等候出国，……我们乘飞机离开美国，于一九五一年十一月二十七日抵达日本羽田空运站……”我方广播的奎恩供词说：他听细菌战的课程是一九五一年十二月十八日在朝鲜群山空军基地。根本没有说他在“去年八月在日本的细菌战学校上课”。因此，美国国际新闻社引述的据说是奎恩的妻子的话不但没有能否定该供词，反而证明了我方广播的奎恩供词的准确性。美国国际新闻社用这种无耻手法编造出来的谎话，反而弄巧成拙，进一步暴露出美国侵略者在这有力证据的指控面前慌张狼狈的丑态及其卑鄙龌龊不择手段的流氓面目。
    炉灰愈擦愈黑。美国侵略者对事实的任何狡辩和抵赖，都只能使它的罪恶面目更加暴露。现在，美国侵略者对于伊纳克和奎恩的供词缄口不提，正是因为罪证是如此有力，揭破了美国侵略者的一切谎话，以致现在它连一个字都不敢提到。而不惜奴颜婢膝一心想替美国主子洗脱细菌战罪名的美国的帮凶们这次也同样不敢作声，这显然因为它们奉到了狼狈不堪的美国主子的保持缄默的命令，以免使自己更加出丑并陷于更加不利的境地。
    但是，缄默同样挽救不了美国侵略者。美国侵略者及其帮凶的“缄默”，恰恰证明他们在如此众多、如此无法辩驳的证据面前束手无策的狼狈窘态；证明他们过去所作的一切狡辩、抵赖，全部都是彻头彻尾的谎话。
