    Confessions of U.S. Air Force POWs are Ironclad Proof of U.S. Germ Warfare
    —Summary of Reader Letters
    After our newspaper published the confessions of U.S. Air Force POWs regarding the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare, we immediately received letters from a broad readership, expressing a high degree of anger and determination to eliminate U.S. germ warfare.
    The entire student body of Renmin University of China wrote: The U.S. aggressors are the most shameless and vicious murderers and liars in the world. They are carrying out heinous germ warfare in broad daylight in Korea and our country, while using all kinds of despicable means to try to deny it. But like the hand of a plague god and the tail of a fox, they cannot hide it no matter what. The confessions, broadcasts, and open letters of the U.S. airmen captured by us have once again provided new ironclad evidence of the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare to the people of the world. We, the entire student body of Renmin University of China, love peace and yearn for the prosperity of culture; we are determined to take practical actions to oppose the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare and fight to defend peace and culture! Fight to eliminate U.S. germ warfare!
    The entire staff of the Beijing Native Produce Company wrote in their letter: After we, the entire staff of the Native Produce Company, read the confessions of the U.S. Air Force POWs, we were all very angry. The confessions of the U.S. prisoners of war once again prove that U.S. imperialism is systematically and on a large scale using bacteriological weapons to slaughter the peace-loving people of China and Korea. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to invade so madly. We are determined to victoriously advance on the economic construction front of our great motherland, actively support the front lines, and eliminate the germ warfare launched by U.S. imperialism.
    Reader Shao Tianren wrote in his letter: After reading the confessions of U.S. Air Force POWs Enoch and Quinn, I am extremely angry. It is absolutely impossible for U.S. aggressors to deceive the people of the world any longer. The confessions of these two U.S. Air Force POWs are ironclad evidence of the U.S. bandits' germ warfare. With such evidence placed before the people of the world, I believe that all people with blood and conscience will rise up in anger, condemn the towering crimes of the U.S. bandits, and work together to eliminate germ warfare!

    美国空军战俘的供词是美国进行细菌战的铁证
    ——读者来信综述
    本报发表了美国空军战俘关于美国侵略者进行细菌战的供词后，立即收到广大读者的来信，这些来信，表示了高度的愤怒和扑灭美国细菌战的决心。
    中国人民大学全体学生来信说：美国侵略者是世界上最无耻、最狠毒的凶手和骗子。它在光天化日之下，在朝鲜和我国进行罪恶滔天的细菌战，却又用尽各种卑鄙手段，百般狡辩抵赖。但是，瘟神的黑手和狐狸的尾巴一样，无论如何都是掩藏不住的。被我们俘获的美国空军人员的供词、广播词和公开信，又在全世界人民面前提供了美国侵略者进行细菌战的新的铁证。我们中国人民大学的全体学生热爱和平，热望文化的繁荣；我们坚决以实际行动，反对美国侵略者的细菌战，为保卫和平与文化而斗争！为扑灭美国细菌战而斗争！
    北京市土产公司全体职工的来信中说：我们土产公司全体职工看了美国空军战俘的供词后，都非常愤怒。美俘的供词，再一次证明了美帝国主义是有计划地大规模地使用细菌武器来屠杀中朝和平人民的。我们决不允许美帝国主义如此疯狂侵略。我们决心在伟大祖国的经济建设战线上胜利进军，积极支援前线，扑灭美帝国主义发动的细菌战。
    读者邵天仁来信说：我看过美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词后，万分愤怒。美国侵略者再想欺骗世界人民是绝对不可能了。这两个美国空军战俘的供词就是美国强盗进行细菌战的铁证。这样的证据摆在全世界人民面前，我相信，凡是有血性、有良心的人们，都将愤然而起，声讨美国强盗的滔天罪行，齐心扑灭细菌战！
