Having undergone the "Three Antis" campaign, the Central Ministry of Textile Industry and the Central Ministry of Trade have both thoroughly examined and overcome their previous departmentalist viewpoints, and have re-studied and determined new methods for the supply and sale of cotton yarn and cloth. The Central Ministry of Textile Industry took the initiative to propose reducing the previously stipulated cotton consumption of 410 jin per bale of 20-count yarn to 395 jin. The Central Ministry of Trade proactively increased the processing fees for each bale of 20-count yarn in Shanghai and Qingdao from 260 real units to 270 real units, while the original 265 units in Tianjin remained unchanged. After consultation, the two ministries reached an agreement, which has been approved by higher authorities and issued to various regions for implementation.

After the reduction in cotton consumption, state-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin alone can save the country more than 200,000 dan of raw cotton annually, increasing the production of cotton yarn worth more than 500 billion yuan. These achievements are mainly due to the workers of various yarn factories, who, under the call of Chairman Mao regarding increasing production and practicing economy, have improved their enthusiasm for production, continuously improved their technology, and saved raw materials.

Currently, state trade agencies are consulting with local private textile factories to revise processing contracts. In the past, capitalists of private textile factories in various regions had defrauded the state of considerable assets by falsely reporting costs. After the "Five Antis," they should overcome their selfish and profit-seeking mentality, strengthen their patriotism, and, under the leadership and supervision of the working class, disclose their true costs and revise the previous unreasonable processing contracts with state trade agencies in accordance with the principles of both public and private benefit and mutual benefit for labor and capital stipulated in the Common Program.

The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Central Ministry of Trade have signed the 1952 Coal Purchase and Sales Agreement for state-owned mines in the East China, North China, and Central South regions.

During the "Three Antis" campaign, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Central Ministry of Trade examined the shortcomings in past coal purchase and sales work, thoroughly examined and overcame a certain degree of capitalist management thinking that existed in the past, and, based on the principles decided by the Central Financial and Economic Commission, signed the 1952 Coal Purchase and Sales Agreement for state-owned mines in the North China, East China, and Central South regions on March 27. The agreement stipulates that, except for coal used by important state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and transportation enterprises, which is directly allocated by the state, all the remaining coal will be uniformly purchased and sold by the China Coal Industry and Building Materials Company affiliated to the Central Ministry of Trade, solving the long-unresolved issue of local sales in mining areas (sales of coal to local residents), and transferring all local sales businesses of each mine to the China Coal Industry and Building Materials Company. In this way, all the coal produced by state-owned coal mines in the East China, North China, and Central South regions in 1952 will have planned sales channels; and state-owned trading companies will be able to control a large amount of coal, which can reasonably adjust regional price differences and maintain complete stability of coal prices this year.

The agreement stipulates that the purchase quantity of the China Coal Industry and Building Materials Company for state-owned coal mines in the East China, North China, and Central South regions has increased by 76 percent compared with 1951, which is the result of a large increase in national coal production this year. In terms of purchase prices, the principle of higher industrial profits than commercial profits is implemented: on the one hand, state-owned industry is guaranteed to complete its fiscal tasks; on the other hand, after state-owned coal mines have accurately calculated their production costs, reasonable profits are left for state-owned commerce. The agreement specifically stipulates the common conditions for product specifications and quality and various contract terms such as delivery, payment, rewards, and penalties between the two parties, in order to ensure the promotion of economic accounting by both parties, improve business management, and improve the quality of production.

The state-owned coal mines and coal industry and building materials companies in the above three regions are now signing specific purchase and sales contracts under the leadership of the local financial and economic commissions, and are handing over local sales businesses in mining areas in accordance with the agreement between the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Central Ministry of Trade. These agreements have now been largely completed.

In addition to fully supplying coal for industrial and urban residents, the China Coal Industry and Building Materials Company is now organizing forces to actively and deeply expand sales to rural areas, especially to economic crop areas and forest protection zones, to widely supply coal, in order to solve the fuel problem in rural areas and increase the production of economic crops.

### 在“三反”运动中克服了本位主义观点  贸易部和纺织工业部改订棉纺加工协议  燃料工业部和贸易部签订煤炭购销协议

    在“三反”运动中克服了本位主义观点
    贸易部和纺织工业部改订棉纺加工协议
    燃料工业部和贸易部签订煤炭购销协议
    中央纺织工业部和中央贸易部经过了“三反”运动，都清算和克服了以往的本位主义观点，重新研究确定了新的棉花纱布供销办法。中央纺织工业部主动提出，把过去规定每件二十支纱四百一十斤的用棉量，降低为三百九十五斤；中央贸易部主动地把原规定上海、青岛两地每件二十支纱二百六十个折实单位的工缴费，增为二百七十个折实单位，天津原定二百六十五个单位仍不变。两部经过磋商，达成了协议，已经上级批准下达各地执行。
    用棉量降低以后，仅上海、青岛、天津三地的国营纱厂，每年可为国家节省原棉二十多万担，增产价值五千多亿元的棉纱。这些成绩，主要是依靠各纱厂的职工，在毛主席关于增产节约的号召下，提高了生产热情，不断改进了技术，节省了原料来获得的。
    现在，国家贸易机关正和当地私营纺织厂磋商改订加工合同。过去各地私营纺织厂的资本家，曾以虚报成本的办法，骗取了国家的不少资财。经过
    “五反”之后，他们应该克服自私自利唯利是图的思想，加强爱国主义精神，在工人阶级的领导和督促下，把真实成本公开出来，依照共同纲领中所规定的公私兼顾劳资两利的原则，和国家贸易机关改订以往的不合理的加工合同。

    中央燃料工业部与中央贸易部签订了一九五二年华东、华北、中南三区国营矿煤炭购销协议。
    在“三反”运动中，中央燃料工业部和中央贸易部检查了过去煤炭购销工作上的缺点，清算和克服了过去存在着的某种程度的资本主义经营思想，根据中央财政经济委员会决定的原则，在三月二十七日签订了一九五二年华北、华东、中南三区国营矿煤炭购销协议。协议中规定：除重要国营工矿、交通企业用煤由国家直接分配外，其余全部由中央贸易部所属中国煤业建筑器材公司统一收购、销售，解决了长期未曾解决的矿区地方销售（销售给当地群众煤炭）的问题，把各矿地方销售业务，全部划归中国煤业建筑器材公司办理。这样就使一九五二年内华东、华北、中南三区国营煤矿生产的全部煤炭，都按计划找到销路；并使国营贸易公司能掌握大量煤炭，可以合理调整地区差价，并保持今年煤价的完全稳定。
    在协议中，规定了中国煤业建筑器材公司对华东、华北、中南三区国营煤矿的收购数量，比一九五一年增加了百分之七十六，这是今年全国煤炭大量增产的结果。在收购价格上，贯彻了工业利润高于商业利润的原则：一方面使国营工业得以保证完成财政任务；另一方面国营煤矿对生产成本进行了精确核算之后，又给国营商业留出了合理利润。协议中具体地规定了产品的规格质量和双方交货、付款、奖励、罚款等各项合同的共同条件，以保证促进双方的经济核算，改善经营管理和提高生产品的质量。
    上述三个地区的国营煤矿和煤业建筑器材公司，现在正根据中央燃料工业部和中央贸易部的协议，在各当地财政经济委员会的领导下，具体签订购销合同，并交接矿区地方销售业务，这些协议现在已大体上签订完毕。
    中国煤业建筑器材公司除充分供应工业和城市人民用煤以外，现正组织力量，积极深入地向农村扩展销路，特别是向经济作物区和护林地带，普遍地供应煤炭，以解决农村的燃料问题，提高经济作物的生产。
