(I)
In the past two years, the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement initiated by outstanding labor models such as Li Yong, Zheng Xikun, Wang Jikui, Qiao Yuyan, Li Xikui, and Yang Maolin in the People's Railways has begun to develop into a nationwide movement. According to statistics in March of this year, 4,503 locomotives nationwide completed or exceeded 500 locomotive-kilometers per day, accounting for 25.6 percent of the total number of locomotives nationwide. Among them, the China Changchun Railway and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus exceeded 44 percent. The national average daily car-kilometers reached 410.5 kilometers, an increase of 11.7 percent compared with the same period last year. The China Changchun Railway and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus have reached more than 450 kilometers. In the same month, 16,474 freight trains nationwide hauled over-axle, transporting more than 262,880,000 ton-kilometers, equivalent to 1.5 times the highest month last year. Yang Maolin's new loading method has been actively promoted in stations across the country, strengthening the planned transportation of less-than-carload freight and improving cargo loading and packaging methods to increase the technical loading capacity of freight cars. Advanced units have increased the average net weight of cargo from 26.5 tons to 28.7 tons. In this movement, advanced drivers have demonstrated great wisdom and continuously created great achievements. Following the Qiao Yuyan Youth Chartered Car Group's initial national record of 1,113.4 kilometers per day, in March of this year, the Yuan Ziwen Chartered Car Group of the Shanghai Locomotive Depot created a new record of 1,135 kilometers, hauling 2,040,000 ton-kilometers. In April, the Geng Benshan Chartered Car Group of Sujiatun set a new record of 1,216.8 daily car-kilometers. In terms of over-axle, since the Zheng Xikun Youth Chartered Car Group first hauled 4,174 tons over-axle in December 1950, higher records of 7,000 tons, 8,000 tons, and even 10,000 tons have continuously emerged. The great creations and movements advocated by these advanced workers have proven the enormous potential of the People's Railway enterprise. This movement is promoting and influencing the overall work of the railway, becoming a driving force for organizing joint labor, tapping potential, and driving enterprise reform.

The full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement can only be generated and developed in the People's country and in socialist state-owned enterprises. It is the result of continuous improvement in the operation and management of railway enterprises in recent years, the result of the continuous improvement of the political, cultural, and material lives of railway workers, and the result of the further development of the patriotic production competition movement. But the most important and decisive condition is the thorough development of the democratic reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement, and the great "Three-Anti" movement in the national railway system in the past two years. Due to the development of this series of revolutionary movements, obstacles to the development of productive forces have been cleared, greatly enhancing the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the working class, creating a solid political and mass foundation for this movement. In addition, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and a complete set of advanced working methods have played a very important guiding role in the development of this movement. The China Changchun Railway is the birthplace and advanced model of this movement; the personal guidance of Soviet experts has helped us overcome various difficulties in ideology, organization, and technology. Without the above conditions, it would be impossible to have such a new stage of labor competition that promotes and influences the rapid progress of all railway work.

The development process of the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement has the following three significant characteristics: First, this movement was initiated from the bottom up by advanced workers leading the way under the leadership of the Party, actively learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and under the personal guidance of Soviet experts. Therefore, it has a very broad mass base and mature objective conditions, making it the most vigorous and unstoppable movement. However, because the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League leading organizations in the railway system in the past have not unified their thinking, concentrated their efforts, and deeply mobilized the masses, and have not solved the various difficulties encountered in organization, technology, and systems, coupled with the different working conditions in various places, the development of this movement is currently very unbalanced: the production standards achieved by advanced workers differ greatly from the general production level, and there is a large gap between advanced and backward areas. Many areas are still in the initial stage of cultivating typical experiences, and some areas have not yet started. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of this movement is the main condition for its universal, in-depth, and normal development.

Second, in the process of the movement's development, outstanding advanced workers have begun to combine the over-axle traction method of maximizing the traction capacity of locomotives, the full loading method of fully utilizing the loading capacity of vehicles, and the fast running method of accelerating the turnaround speed of locomotives and vehicles for five hundred kilometers into a complete and unified revolutionary competition movement. In this way, the quality of this movement has been greatly improved, and the production volume of railway transportation work—ton-kilometers of freight—has been increased to a great extent. It is possible to overcome the waste of transportation capacity, such as under-axle, unnecessary single-engine operation, and under-loading, and to achieve the goal of completing the largest transportation tasks with the least number of locomotives and vehicles. However, at present, the instances of closely combining full loading, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer operation are still few and far between, and it is only a beginning. Most areas have not yet combined them, and phenomena such as under-axle, under-loading, and unnecessary single-engine operation still exist widely. Overcoming this waste phenomenon must go through a serious struggle.

Third, the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement has not been generated and developed peacefully and smoothly, but has been filled with contradictions and struggles between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, from beginning to end. This struggle between the newborn and the old, the advanced and the backward, is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

First, the sharp opposition between the corrupt bourgeois conservative ideology and the advanced proletarian progressive ideology. The advanced proletarian ideology is represented by advanced elements in the conscious working class—Communist Party members, Youth League members, and advanced workers. They are never satisfied with past achievements and enthusiastically learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Many of them have mastered the technology of their profession. They take the attitude of masters of the house, being serious, responsible, brave, and intelligent, not afraid of difficulties, and tenacious. They proactively contact each other, actively forge ahead, and are not afraid of ridicule and attacks from all sides, confidently pushing the movement forward. The backward conservatives are completely the opposite. They always look backward, complacently satisfied with past achievements, and cannot see the huge potential that still exists. They stick to old ways and are superstitious about outdated technical standards, completely disregarding people's initiative when setting technical quotas. They always subordinate people to machines, rather than treating people as the masters of machines. They always emphasize that the gradients in their jurisdiction are large, there are many curves, the station lines are short, the speed limits on the lines are low, there are many slow-speed sections, the quality of locomotives and vehicles is poor, the technical level of workers is too low, and the source of goods and traffic flow are abnormal, etc. They use the above-mentioned objective difficulties, which do not fully exist or can be greatly improved, as shields, instead of actively solving them. They even scold this movement as "killing the chicken to get the eggs" and reprimand advanced workers as "reckless" who do not understand technology. When advanced workers encounter setbacks in practice, instead of helping them with an encouraging attitude, they give them blows instead. This conservative ideology is the filth left over from the old society and must be eliminated in order to smoothly carry out this movement.

Second, the contradiction between socialist enterprise management methods and capitalist management methods. The full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement is a movement of production innovation and must be adapted to advanced management systems. Therefore, it requires that all departments of railway enterprises must be interconnected, work rhythmically, have meticulous daily plans, fix locomotive routes as much as possible, formulate tight operation charts, and implement a cyclical operation system, etc. But the current situation is far from this. The phenomenon of departmentalism, where there is a lack of connection and cooperation between departments, is quite common. The non-fixed, large-shift locomotive routes and outdated scheduling methods seriously damage the enthusiasm and initiative of locomotive crews, causing this movement to fall into a state of intermittent, ebb and flow. The achievements painstakingly created by many advanced drivers are "swallowed up" by phenomena such as under-axle loads and out-of-station stops caused by the poor scheduling of individual commanders. This backward management method is a reflection of conservative ideology and a shackle to the development of this movement.

Third, the contradiction between backward technical standards and advanced technology and advanced working methods. The full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement is a synthesis of various advanced methods. Without the promotion of advanced technology and advanced methods as a foundation, it will never be able to develop normally and sustainably. Conservatives completely ignore this point, or take a passive attitude of indifference, or "steal the beams and replace the pillars" of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, making it deteriorate. This phenomenon is absolutely not allowed. We must vigorously organize technical learning and large-scale promotion of advanced working methods to create conditions for the smooth development of this movement.

In short, although the old and corrupt things still limit the progress of the movement, they have become something hated and discarded by the masses. With the development of the mass struggle, they will gradually be abandoned. Objective conditions have matured and are available. As long as the leadership is strengthened, the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement will surely move forward smoothly.

The above is a summary of the basic situation and main experiences at present.

(II)
In railway enterprises, carrying out the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement is a concrete action of railway employees responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers." The development of this movement has profound political and economic significance.

First, it will accelerate the circulation speed of materials and strive to transport materials to all parts of the country in the shortest possible time. In this way, it will directly strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, accelerate the turnover of working capital of public and private enterprises across the country, and will have an important impact on consolidating national defense, supporting the front line, and developing the national economy.

Second, it will further develop and consolidate the great achievements of democratic reform and become a great driving force for promoting production reform. All old management systems and old technical quotas will inevitably be gradually negated with the development of the movement; new systems and new technical quotas will be created quickly. Therefore, it becomes an important lever for promoting economic accounting. In addition, it is especially important not to ignore the significant role of this movement in ideological transformation. The vast numbers of cadres and workers will receive profound ideological education and quickly learn to master technical and management skills. All purely technical viewpoints that ignore politics, conservative viewpoints that are divorced from reality, and slavish ideas that worship England and the United States will be ruthlessly criticized in the face of living facts and will have to be revised. It will not only supplement and revise the opinions of managers, engineers, and technicians, but also promote their progress.

Third, after the movement is carried out in depth, it will obviously save more locomotives, vehicles, fuel, oil, and a large amount of maintenance costs, save a large amount of labor and some mechanical equipment, expand line capacity, rapidly increase labor productivity, reduce transportation costs, and increase fiscal revenue. Not only that, but it can also promote all railway employees to improve the quality of major equipment such as locomotives, vehicles, and lines most actively and responsibly.

Fourth, the development of the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement will inevitably improve the cultural and technical level of the railway workers. It requires changing the state of backward technology and requires having personnel proficient in their profession in the shortest possible time. In fact, many labor models (such as Zheng Xikun, Qiao Yuyan, etc.) have already reached this level. As long as the leadership is strengthened, a large number of outstanding talents will inevitably be trained in the movement after them.

Fifth, the result of the movement's development will promote the reform of railway enterprise management methods and labor organization, and will help the development of Party work, political work, and mass work. It is a mass movement that runs through all departments of railway enterprises and will inevitably promote and influence the work of all departments.

(III)
The current situation of the People's Railway is: the democratic reform work is basically nearing completion and is about to enter a historical stage centered on production reform. Each railway bureau should, according to the specific circumstances of its region, after the "Three-Anti" movement and the make-up lessons of democratic reform are completed, switch to the central task of production reform in a timely manner, issue this year's production plan, and mobilize the masses with leadership, with workshops and groups as units, formulating plans from the bottom up and putting forward competition conditions. On this basis, the entire railway, without exception, will take the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement as the center, and carry out large-scale patriotic production competitions in a focused and gradual manner. In order to carry out this movement well, the following decisions are made:

First, strengthen the ideological leadership of the movement and thoroughly criticize the bureaucratic, conservative, departmentalist, and formalistic ideologies that hinder the progress of the movement. Party organizations at all levels, political workers, and leading cadres of all departments must have sufficient estimates of this ideological enemy, use all scientific basis and practical proof, and launch ideological struggles against it in the form of criticism and self-criticism. We must be good at analyzing the manifestations of these erroneous ideas, analyzing the root causes of these erroneous ideas, grasping the central issues of the moment, and thoroughly criticizing them. The development process of the movement must be貫串with ideological struggle from beginning to end. Therefore, strengthening ideological leadership becomes the key to whether the movement can be carried out well.

Second, combine the "Three-Anti" movement, deeply mobilize the masses, and transfer the political enthusiasm of the workers in the "Three-Anti" movement to production competition in a timely manner. To this end, it is necessary to carry out large-scale propaganda and mobilization work according to the different situations in various places, using all opportunities and occasions, mobilizing all propaganda tools, and mobilizing the masses ideologically through various forms of propaganda. On this basis, lead the masses to formulate concrete action plans; at the same time, mobilize the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism, urge leading cadres, extensively mobilize rationalization proposals, and launch extensive mass competition movements.

Third, improve the operation and management of enterprises. First, it is required that the chief administrators of the railway and sub-bureaus should uniformly organize all administrative departments into the movement. It is necessary to assign specific tasks, determine specific goals to strive for, and conduct regular inspections according to the different business natures; strive to formulate realistic work plans, formulate tight operation diagrams, fix locomotive routes as much as possible, and implement a cyclical operation system; pay great attention to improving traffic and locomotive scheduling work, improving the quality of scheduling personnel, and improving their working conditions; improve the necessary telecommunications equipment and improve the quality of telecommunications work; improve the maintenance quality of locomotives and vehicles and shorten the number of days in the factory; enrich the cadres of the commercial department and pay attention to strengthening the leadership of loading and unloading workers; strive to reduce and eliminate adverse phenomena such as under-axle loads, under-loading, out-of-station stops, slow-speed sections on lines, and damage accidents to locomotives and vehicles. With the development of the movement, it is also necessary to appropriately adjust or add some necessary technical equipment.

Fourth, with the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement as the center, actively organize and promote the advanced experiences of various business departments such as the new operating method, the new dispatching method, the new loading method, the Luning locomotive maintenance method, the Li Xikui shunting method, the Nie Feidov road maintenance method, and the high-speed cutting method, conscientiously implement the Kovalev working method, and universally improve the technical level of all employees. Without these advanced technologies and advanced working methods being mastered by the majority of workers, the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement cannot be carried out well. Engineering and technical personnel are an important force in this work and must be organized into the movement; this will not only enable them to play their due active role, but also enable them to be trained, transformed, and improved from the movement.

Fifth, in this movement, leaders at all levels should always care about the lives of employees, improve working conditions, and pay attention to preventing possible deviations such as adventure, recklessness, disregard for traffic safety, and disregard for physical health. It is necessary to reward advanced workers and model figures in the movement in a timely manner, and should begin to study and formulate appropriate reward methods.

Sixth, for unified leadership, in the initial stage of the movement's development, the sub-bureau and above should take the Party organization as the core, and absorb administration, trade unions, and the Youth League to jointly form a "Full Load, Over-Axle, and Five Hundred Kilometer Movement Committee," and can set up a certain number of staff members to be responsible for comprehensively developing the movement, researching, summarizing, and exchanging experiences; after the movement is carried out in depth, it can be abolished as appropriate. In addition, it is necessary to open temporary advanced working method learning classes and select outstanding employees to train them into the backbone of the movement.

    中国新民主主义青年团铁道工作委员会联合发布
    关于开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的决定
    （一）
    近两年来人民铁路中，由李永、郑锡坤、王吉奎、乔玉岩、李锡奎、杨茂林等优秀的劳动模范人物所发起的满载、超轴、五百公里运动，发展到目前为止已经开始成为全路规模的运动。据今年三月份统计，全国铁路已有四、五○三个机车台日完成或超过了五百日车公里，占全国机车台日总数的百分之二五点六。其中中长、锦州各局超过百分之四十四。全国日车公里平均达到四一○点五公里，较去年同一时期提高了百分之十一点七。其中中长局、锦州局已达到四百五十余公里。在同一个月份内，全国有一六、四七四次货物列车超轴牵引二亿六千二百八十八万余吨公里，等于去年最高月份的一点五倍。杨茂林的新装车法已在全国各站积极地推行着，从加强零担货物的计划运送，改善货物的装载方法和包装方法，来提高货车的技术装载量，先进的单位已经把货物的净载重平均由二六点五吨，提高到二八点七吨。在这一运动中，先进的司机们发挥了极大的智慧，不断地创造出伟大的事迹，继乔玉岩青年包车组首创全国日车公里的最高纪录一、一一三点四公里之后，今年三月又出现上海机务段袁自文包车组创造一、一三五公里，牵引二○四万吨公里的最高纪录，四月苏家屯耿本善包车组又首创一、二一六点八日车公里的新纪录。在超轴方面，从郑锡坤青年包车组于一九五零年十二月份首次超轴牵引四、一七四吨之后，就不断出现七千吨、八千吨，以至一万吨的更高纪录。这些先进工作者的伟大创造及所倡导的运动，证明了人民铁道企业有着巨大的潜在力。这一运动正推动和影响铁路全盘工作，成为组织联合劳动、发掘潜在力、带动企业改革的动力。
    满载、超轴、五百公里运动只能在人民的国家内，社会主义性质的国营企业里才能够产生和发展。它是几年来铁道企业的经营管理不断改进的结果，是铁路工人政治、文化、物质生活不断改善的结果；是爱国主义生产竞赛运动进一步发展的结果。但最主要的有决定意义的条件，是由于两年来在全国铁道系统中，深入地开展了民主改革运动，镇压反革命运动，抗美援朝爱国主义运动，和这次伟大的“三反”运动。由于这一系列的革命运动的开展，清除了束缚生产力发展的障碍，极大地提高了工人阶级的政治觉悟和劳动积极性，给这一运动创造了坚固的政治基础与群众基础。另外，苏联的先进经验和一套完整的先进工作方法，给这一运动的开展发挥了极重要的指导作用。中国长春铁路是这一运动的发源地和先进的榜样；苏联专家的亲自指导，帮助我们在思想上、组织上和技术上战胜了各种困难。没有以上种种条件，就不可能出现这样一个推动与影响铁道一切工作迅速前进的劳动竞赛的新阶段。
    满载、超轴、五百公里运动的发展过程有以下三个显著的特点：首先，这一运动是在党的领导下由先进的工人带头，积极学习苏联先进经验和在苏联专家亲自指导下从下层开始的，是从群众中诞生和扩展起来的。因此，它就有极广泛的群众基础和成熟的客观条件，它就成为最有生命力而不可遏止的运动。但由于过去铁道系统中党、行政、工会、青年团各领导组织，还没有统一思想，集中力量，深入地去发动群众，没有在组织上、技术上和制度上解决已经遇到的各种困难问题，再加上各地工作条件的不同，因而在目前使这一运动的发展，还呈现着很不平衡的状态：先进工作者所达到的生产标准和一般的生产水平相差很大，先进地区和落后地区也相距甚远，不少地区还处在培养典型取得经验的初期阶段，部分地区还没有开始。因此，加强对于这一运动的领导，是这一运动普遍深入和正常发展的主要条件。
    第二、在运动的发展过程中，优秀的先进工作者们已经开始把发挥机车牵引能力的超轴牵引方法，充分利用车辆装载能力的满载方法和加速机车、车辆周转速度的五百公里的快速运行方法汇合而为一个完整的统一的革命竞赛运动。这样，就极大地提高了这一运动的质量，在很大的限度内增加了铁道运输工作的生产量——货物吨公里，就可以克服运输力的浪费，如欠轴、不必要的单机运行以及不满载等现象，就可能达到使用最少的机车、车辆完成最大的运输任务的目的。但目前能够把满载、超轴、五百公里运行紧密结合起来的事迹还是少数的，还只是一个开端，大多数地区还没有结合起来，欠轴、不满载和不必要的单机运行等还普遍存在着，克服这一浪费现象必须经过一个严重的斗争。
    第三、满载、超轴、五百公里运动，绝不是和平地、一帆风顺地产生和发展起来的，而是自始至终都充满着新旧之间、先进和落后之间的矛盾和斗争。这个新生的和陈旧的、先进的与落后的斗争，主要表现在以下方面：
    首先是腐朽的资产阶级的保守思想和先进的无产阶级进步思想的尖锐对立。先进的无产阶级思想是以觉悟的工人阶级中的先进分子——共产党员、青年团员和先进工作者为代表。他们永远不以过去的成就为满足，热烈地学习苏联的先进经验。他们中间的很多人已经精通了本行技术。他们以主人翁的姿态，认真负责勇敢而有智慧，不畏艰难，顽强不屈；处处主动联系，积极进取；不怕来自各方面的讥讽与打击，充满信心地把运动推向前进。落后的保守主义者，却和这完全相反。他们总是向后看，沾沾自喜地满足于过去的成绩，看不见目前还存在着巨大的潜在力量。他们墨守成规，迷信陈旧的技术标准，在规定技术定额时完全把人的能动性抛开不管。他们总是把人从属于机器，而不是把人当成机器的主人。他们总是一味的强调本管内坡道大、弯道多、站线短、线路限制速度低、徐行处多、机车车辆质量不好、工人的技术水平太低、货源货流不正常等等。他们把上述这些本来并不完全存在或者可以很大改善的客观困难作为挡箭牌，而不积极加以解决。他们甚至还责骂这个运动是“杀鸡取蛋”，训斥先进工人是不懂技术的“蛮干”；当先进的工人在实践中遇到挫折时，不是以鼓励的态度给以帮助，相反地还给以打击。这种保守思想是旧社会遗留下的污毒，必须加以清除，才能顺利开展这一运动。
    其次是社会主义的企业经营管理方法和资本主义的管理方法的矛盾。满载、超轴、五百公里运动是生产革新的运动，必须有先进的经营管理制度相适应。因此，它要求铁道企业的一切部门必须彼此联系，有节奏地工作，有周密的日计划，尽可能地固定机车交路，制定紧密运行图，要求实行循环运转制等等。但目前的实际情况却和这距离甚远，相当普遍地存在着互不联系、互不配合的本位主义现象。不固定的大轮班式的机车交路和陈旧的调度方法，严重地损害了机车乘务员的积极性和主动性，使这一运动陷于时断时续、此起彼伏的状态。许多先进司机们辛勤地创造出来的成就，被个别指挥员的不良调度所造成的不满轴、机外停车等现象所“吞没”。这种落后的管理方法是保守思想的反映，是开展这一运动的桎梏。
    再次，是落后的技术标准和先进的技术、先进的工作方法之间的矛盾。满载、超轴、五百公里运动是各种先进方法的综合，没有先进技术、先进方法的推广作基础，绝对不会正常而持久地开展起来。保守主义者们完全忽视这一点，或者采取漠不关心的消极态度，或者把苏联的先进经验“抽梁换柱”，使它变质，这种现象是绝对不能容许的。我们必须大力组织技术学习和大规模地推广先进工作方法，为顺利地开展这一运动创造条件。
    总之，旧的腐朽的东西虽然还限制着运动的前进，但它已成为群众所憎恨所唾弃的东西。随着群众斗争的开展，它们将会逐渐被废弃。客观条件已经成熟了和具备了，只要加强领导，满载、超轴、五百公里运动一定会顺利前进。
    以上是目前的基本情况和主要经验的概括总结。
    （二）
    在铁道企业内，开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，是铁路员工响应毛主席所提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召的具体行动。这一运动的开展，有着深刻的政治的和经济的意义。
    首先，它将会加速物资的流转速度，争取在最短的时间内把物资输送到全国各地去。这样，就直接加强了城乡物资的交流，加速了全国各公私企业流动资金的周转，对于巩固国防，支援前线，发展国民经济，将会发生重要的影响。
    第二、它将会进一步发展和巩固民主改革的伟大成果，并成为推动生产改革的伟大的动力。一切旧的管理制度，旧的技术定额，必然会随着运动的发展逐渐地被否定；新的制度，新的技术定额，将会迅速地创造出来。因而，它就成为推行经济核算制的重要杠杆。另外，尤其不可忽略的是，这个运动还具有思想改造的重大作用。广大的干部与工人群众，将会受到深刻的思想教育，迅速学会掌握技术和经营管理的本领。一切忽视政治的单纯技术观点，脱离实际的保守主义观点和崇拜英美的奴化思想，将会在活的事实面前受到无情的批判，而不得不加以修正。它不仅会补充和修正管理人员工程师和技师的意见，而且会推动他们前进。
    第三、运动深入地开展以后，显然地将会节约出更多的机车、车辆、燃料、油脂和大量的检修费用，节约出大量的劳动力和部分的机械设备，扩大线路容量，迅速地提高劳动生产率，减低运输成本，增加财政收入。不仅如此，还可以推动全体铁路员工，最积极、最负责地去改善机车、车辆、线路等主要设备的质量。
    第四、满载、超轴、五百公里运动的开展，必然提高铁路工人群众文化技术水准。它要求改变技术落后的状态，要求在最短时间内具有精通本行技术的人材。事实上，不少的劳动模范（如郑锡坤、乔玉岩等），他们已经达到了这个水平。只要加强领导，继他们之后必然会在运动中训练出大批的优秀人材。
    第五、运动发展的结果，将会推动铁道企业经营管理方法和劳动组织的改革，将会帮助党的工作、政治工作、群众工作的发展。它是贯串于铁道企业一切部门的群众运动，必然对一切部门的工作发生推动和影响的作用。
    （三）
    目前人民铁道的情况是：民主改革工作基本上接近完成，并即将进入以生产改革为中心的历史阶段。各路局应根据自己地区的具体情况，在“三反”运动和民主改革补课完成后，适时地转入以生产改革为中心任务，下达今年的生产计划，有领导地发动群众，以车间、小组为单位，自下而上地订计划，提出竞赛条件。在这一基础上，全路毫无例外地以开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动为中心，有重点地、逐步地展开大规模的爱国主义生产竞赛。为把这一运动开展得好，特作如下的决定：
    第一、加强运动的思想领导，彻底批判阻碍运动前进的官僚主义、保守主义、本位主义、形式主义思想。各级党的组织、政治工作者和一切部门的领导干部，必须对这个思想上的敌人有足够的估计，用一切科学的根据和实践的证明，以批评和自我批评的方式，向它开展思想斗争。要善于分析这些错误思想的表现形式，分析这些错误思想产生的根源，抓住当前的中心问题，彻底地给以批判。运动的发展过程，必然是自始至终地贯串着思想斗争。因此，加强思想领导就成为运动开展好坏的决定关键。
    第二、结合“三反”运动，深入地发动群众，把工人群众在“三反”运动中的政治热情，适时地转移到生产竞赛中去。为此，要根据各地的不同情况，开展大规模的宣传动员工作，利用一切机会、一切场合，动员一切宣传工具，通过各种宣传形式，从思想上发动群众。在这基础上，有领导地组织群众制定出具体的行动计划；同时，要发动群众开展批评和自我批评，督促领导干部，大量地发动合理化建议，展开广泛群众性的竞赛运动。
    第三、改进企业的经营管理。首先要求管理局、分局各行政首长，把行政的各部门都统一组织到运动中来。要根据不同的业务性质，分配给具体任务，确定具体的奋斗目标，定期检查；要力求制定合乎实际的工作计划，制定紧密运行图，尽可能地固定机车交路，实行循环运转制；要极大的注意改善行车机车调度工作，提高调度人员的质量和改善他们的劳动条件；要改善必要的电务设备，提高电务工作的质量；要提高机车车辆的检修质量，缩短在厂日数；要充实商务部门的干部，注意加强装卸工人的领导；要力求减少和消灭欠轴、不满载、机外停车、线路徐行处所、机车、车辆的破损事故等不良现象。随着运动的发展，还必须适当地调整或增设某些必要的技术设备。
    第四、以满载、超轴、五百公里运动为中心，积极地组织推广新操纵法、新调度法、新装载法、鲁宁机车保养法、李锡奎调车法、聂菲铎夫养路法、高速切削法等各业务部门的先进经验，认真实行郭瓦廖夫工作方法，普遍地提高全体职工的技术水平。没有这些先进的技术和先进的工作方法为广大工人所掌握，满载、超轴、五百公里运动就不能得到很好的开展。工程技术人员在这一工作中是一支重要的力量，必须把他们都组织到运动中去；这不仅能够发挥他们应有的积极作用，还能使他们从运动中得到锻炼、改造和提高。
    第五、在这一运动中，各级领导者要随时关心职工的生活，改进劳动条件，注意防止冒险、蛮干、不重视行车安全、不注意身体健康等可能的偏向的产生。要及时奖励运动中的先进工作者和模范人物，并应开始研究制定适当的奖励办法。
    第六、为统一领导，在运动发展的初期阶段，分局以上应以党的组织为核心，吸收行政、工会、青年团联合组成“满载、超轴、五百公里运动委员会”，并可设立一定数量的办事人员，负责综合运动的发展情况，研究、总结、交流经验；到运动深入开展后，即可酌情撤销。另外，必须开办临时性的先进工作方法学习班，选择优秀的员工，培养成为运动中的骨干。    一九五二年五月一日
