Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an article on the 12th written by Korean Minister of Public Health, Li Bingnan, entitled "The Enemy's Bacterial Warfare Crimes are Being Crushed." Li Bingnan pointed out in the article that the heroic Korean people's resolute anti-epidemic struggle has crushed and continues to crush the heinous public enemy of mankind, the American imperialists’ bacterial warfare.

Li Bingnan pointed out the reasons for the Korean people's preliminary victory in the anti-bacterial warfare: First, this is due to the thorough anti-epidemic countermeasures adopted by the Republic government, which not only inspired the patriotic spirit and vengeful hearts of all the people, but also suggested effective methods to crush the enemy's bacterial warfare crimes; second, this is due to the selfless dedication of all healthcare workers, who resolutely implemented the anti-epidemic countermeasures; third, this is due to the intense hatred of all the people, who rose up to carry out a tense struggle against bacterial warfare.

Li Bingnan wrote: Our anti-epidemic front is very strong, but we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. In order to thoroughly crush the enemy's atrocities, there should be no slackening. The enemy's aggressive ambitions are endless, and we must further strengthen the anti-epidemic struggle. Li Bingnan called on all healthcare workers and all the people to heighten their vigilance, strengthen discipline, consolidate the achievements already made in the anti-bacterial warfare, conscientiously implement the instructions and orders of the Military Commission, and thoroughly crush the bacterial warfare of the American invading bandits.
