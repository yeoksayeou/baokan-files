    ▲ The newly formed grapes in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang are already hanging heavily on the branches. The Uyghur farmers are joyfully anticipating a bumper grape harvest this year. The area planted with grapes in this region has been expanded this year, with Turpan County alone expanding by 460 mu. The Turpan Basin is one of the most famous grape-producing areas in the country, abundant in seedless white grapes, mare’s nipple grapes, etc. The annual production of raisins alone exceeds 1.8 million jin. Thanks to the People's Government's loans to support grape production and planned procurement, last year's raisins were sold as far as Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Guihua, Nanning and other places. This year, farmers' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high, with each grape plant being fertilized with 800 to 1,500 jin. When young Uyghur girls set up trellises for the grapes (because the vines must be buried underground every winter to prevent freezing), they are especially careful not to injure the grape branches and leaves. They have also organized hedgehog-beating teams to beat and kill hedgehogs that steal grapes.
    ▲ Li Duchun, a labor model in Shifeng Township, Yongchun County, Fujian Province, planted 1.12 mu of sweet potatoes last year and harvested 13,150 jin, with an average yield of 11,688 jin and 13 liang per mu, which is three to four times higher than the yield of the same land cultivated by local farmers. Li Duchun also plans to continue to improve production technology this year and increase production by another 15% compared to last year, reaching a sweet potato yield of 13,441 jin per mu. Every year, Li Duchun leaves behind plants with high yields and many tubers, storing them in earthen pits or sweet potato piles (with grass ash placed at the bottom of the pits to prevent termite damage), which can reduce water evaporation and make it easier to germinate during seedling cultivation. Ordinary farmers plow their sweet potato fields only twice and harrow once, while Li Duchun plows three times and harrows twice, and he also pays attention to early plowing and fine harrowing. Ordinary farmers plant sweet potato seedlings about six or seven inches apart, while he plants his seedlings only four inches apart. Dense planting and more fertilization are the main reasons for Li Duchun's bumper harvest. In addition, Li Duchun also pays close attention to vine trimming, irrigation, drainage, pest control and crop rotation. He uses sharp scissors to trim the vines without damaging the sweet potato seedlings. His sweet potato fields are planted with rice once every three years to adjust the land's fertility.
    ▲ Spring tea from the Central South region has already entered the market. This year, the tea output of the entire region is expected to increase by about 17% compared to last year. State-owned tea companies in various parts of the Central South region are vigorously purchasing tea.
    Last winter, the People's Government loaned 10 billion yuan to help tea farmers manage tea gardens, process fertilizer, and this spring, it issued another 5 billion yuan in spring tea picking loans to help tea farmers solve the difficulties of lacking tools and food during the tea picking season. As a result, production has greatly increased. The Central South District Company of China Tea Corporation began pre-purchasing spring tea from tea farmers in February and March this year, and it is estimated that the amount of spring tea purchased this year will increase by 36% compared to last year. Of this, the part purchased through cooperatives accounts for about 60% of the total. In order to help tea farmers improve their black tea production techniques and improve the quality of tea, many areas in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have opened tea farmer training classes to guide them in using new methods to make tea.

    ▲新疆吐鲁番盆地新结的葡萄已累累地挂满枝头，维吾尔族农民喜悦地预期今年的葡萄将要丰收。这个地区今年种植葡萄的面积扩大了，仅吐鲁番一县就扩大了四百六十亩。吐鲁番盆地是全国最著名的葡萄产地之一，盛产无核白葡萄、马奶子葡萄等，仅葡萄干一项，就年产一百八十万斤以上。由于人民政府贷款扶助葡萄生产，有计划地收购，去年葡萄干已远销到上海、天津、西安、归绥、南宁等地。今年农民生产热情空前提高，每墩葡萄施肥八百斤到一千五百斤。年轻的维吾尔族姑娘在给葡萄搭架时（因每年冬季须将蔓枝埋在地下防冻），特别小心仔细，不使葡萄枝叶受伤。她们还组织了打刺猬队，扑打窃食葡萄的刺猬。
    ▲福建省永春县狮蜂乡劳动模范李笃春去年种蕃薯（甘薯）一亩一分二厘，收获了一万三千一百五十斤，平均每亩产量达一万一千六百八十八斤十三两，较当地农民同等土地的产量高三倍到四倍。李笃春并计划在今年继续改进生产技术，再比去年增产一成半，达到每亩蕃薯产量一万三千四百四十一斤。李笃春种蕃薯每年都是把产量高、薯块多的植株留下来，贮存在土穴或蕃薯堆中（穴底放草木灰，以防白蚁侵害），这样可减少水分蒸发，育苗时易于发芽。一般农民的蕃薯田只耕二耙一，李笃春是犁三耙二，而且他还注意早耕、细耙。一般农民插薯苗是每株相距六、七寸，他插的薯苗每株只隔四寸。密植和施肥多，是李笃春丰收的主要原因。此外，李笃春对剪蔓灌溉排水、防治虫害和轮作等也很注意。他剪蔓用利剪，不伤薯苗。他的蕃薯田每三年种一次水稻，以调节地力。
    ▲中南区春茶已经上市，今年全区茶叶产量约可比去年增加百分之十七，中南各地国营茶业公司正在大力收购。
    人民政府去年冬天曾贷款一百亿元，帮助茶农整理茶园，加工施肥，今年春天又发放了春茶采摘贷款五十亿元，帮助茶农解决采茶期间缺乏工具和口粮的困难。因此，产量大增。中国茶业公司中南区公司在今年二、三月间就开始向茶农预购春茶，预计今年收购春茶的数量将比去年增加百分之三十六。其中委托合作社收购的部分，约占总数的百分之六十。为了帮助茶农改进红茶制作技术，提高茶叶品质，湖南、江西两省不少地区开办了茶农训练班，指导他们用新法制茶。
