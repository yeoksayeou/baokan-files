    New People, New Style
    —On Zhang Fengquan, a Newly Promoted Worker-Cadre from the Beijing North China Agricultural Machinery Factory
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ren Zhiqiao
    Since the “Three-Anti” Movement, many worker activists have been promoted to leadership positions. Some people wonder: Are they up to the task? Let's take a look at Comrade Zhang Fengquan from the Beijing North China Agricultural Machinery Factory. He was promoted from a team leader in the lathe workshop to the head of the supply and marketing section, and in less than three months, the employees have been praising him: "Our Lao Zhang is a good model in production and a good director in supply and marketing."
    When the leadership first announced this appointment, some people were indeed skeptical. Zhang Fengquan has less than a junior high school education and doesn't understand supply and marketing, how could he possibly do it? But in fact, he not only did well, but also bravely broke with convention, bringing a new look to supply and marketing work.
    When the leadership assigned the task, they told him: Materials account for 60 percent of the total production cost, and controlling materials is a major issue in reducing costs. He kept this in mind. The Agricultural Machinery Factory takes orders, so sales are not a problem. The main tasks of the supply and marketing section are to purchase and supply materials. It must supply materials in a timely manner so as not to delay production, and it must not accumulate capital to avoid increasing costs. This is the basic contradiction of this work. Due to his high sense of responsibility for the national construction cause, he grasped this basic contradiction.
    He found that a large amount of materials were stockpiled in the warehouse, including many that were bought as early as 1949. Originally, the supply and marketing section never considered the accumulation of capital when buying materials. As long as the planning section sent a plan, they would buy as much as was required, often buying a quarter or even a year's worth of materials at once. As for the collusion between embezzlers and unscrupulous merchants, buying a lot of unsalable goods at high prices, that goes without saying. Zhang Fengquan thought: Stacking up materials is stacking up money, how can this reduce costs? Therefore, he was determined to find a way to change this so-called old rule of "doing as ordered."
    Once, the planning section wanted to buy 800 tons of pig iron. He knew that 300 tons had already been paid for but not yet delivered, and 450 tons were still in the warehouse. In March, more than 200 tons were used, leaving more than 500 tons. Therefore, with the consent of the planning section, he only bought 300 tons. This one purchase alone reduced the accumulation of capital by about 700 million yuan.
    To be responsible to the country and the people, one must have the courage to overcome all difficulties. At first, some people were not satisfied with his "meddling." In early April, the timber purchased from the Northeast had not yet arrived, and the carpentry workshop asked the planning section to first buy 300 cubic meters of timber in Beijing to make plow handles. But the price in Beijing was twice as high as in the Northeast. When Comrade Zhang Fengquan received this task, he first checked the inventory in the warehouse and learned that there were still 200,000 jin of scrap material, which could still be used to make plow handles. He was determined to save this money. The next day, he went to the carpentry workshop to mobilize the workers to use scrap material. At that time, some people were dissatisfied, saying sarcastically: "The higher-ups have already agreed, why are you making trouble? Is the section chief less capable than you?" The carpentry workshop director said: "You're responsible if production is delayed." Some workers said: "Lao Zhang! You just left the workshop, how could you forget about production?" Zhang Fengquan did not yield to these comrades. He patiently explained the market and supply and marketing situation to the workers. He said: "I just came from the workshop and know that everyone likes to use whole materials. Logs are indeed good, convenient for using large or small pieces; scrap material is troublesome and tiring to use. But we also have to think about saving money! If we don't buy this batch of material, we can save more than 500 million yuan, equivalent to more than 500,000 jin of millet." When the workers understood this situation, their enthusiasm immediately rose, and they all said that this money should be saved, and they immediately went to the warehouse to select materials. As a result, the materials for these 3,500 plow handles were all found in the scrap pile. Another time, the planning section wanted to buy 160 sets of taps, with a market unit price of 400,000 yuan per set, totaling 64 million yuan. Zhang Fengquan found that there were still 300 sets in the warehouse. He thought: They clearly know that there are, why are they still buying them? Maybe because they are made in our own factory and are not as good as foreign goods. But at least two of ours can be used as one of theirs! At this time, he went to the screw workshop to find the team leader and the workers to discuss. He told everyone that if we use our own taps, we can save the country 72,000 jin of millet. When the workers heard such a large number, they not only didn't want to buy them, but also found more than 30 sets from their own workshop's small warehouse.
    From these facts, we can see that the reason why Comrade Zhang Fengquan did such a good job is not only because of his high sense of responsibility for the cause of the country and the people, but also because he can face the workshops and rely on the masses in his work. He often urged his comrades in the section to go deep into the workshops to understand the production situation and requirements. As a result, everyone was very busy and could no longer sit in the office all day like before. The two telephones were busy all day, and the supply and marketing section's office also became "lively," with workers constantly coming to contact them. Some comrades in the supply and marketing section were initially not satisfied with this situation. Some said: "How can we be so busy? Didn't we work the same way before without contacting the workshops!" Some said: "If we buy several months' worth of materials, we wouldn't have these troubles." Some were unhappy with the "lively" office: "This doesn't look like an office, it's more like a workshop!" Facts have proved that these views are wrong. Work should not always be done in the same old way. Those people were quickly persuaded by Comrade Zhang Fengquan.
    Comrade Zhang Fengquan also dared to criticize the leadership when he found shortcomings in their work. For example, in early April, the foundry workshop requested to buy 30 tons of iron oxide; in fact, only 10 tons were needed. This was mainly because the workshop director wanted to buy more for convenience; and he was afraid that the supply would not be timely, delaying production like in the past. Originally, this could have been reviewed, but the section chiefs of the production section, the planning section, and the manager's section all stamped their seals on the plan without carefully reviewing it. Comrade Zhang Fengquan then gave his opinions to these section chiefs, pointing out that stamping seals so carelessly would immediately accumulate several hundred million yuan. The section chiefs all humbly accepted this criticism.
    In his supply and marketing work, Comrade Zhang Fengquan constantly guarded against unscrupulous merchants taking advantage of loopholes. Some time ago, the fitter workshop wanted to buy a batch of No. 11 steel wire, and the merchants deliberately raised the price, charging 4,000 to 5,000 yuan more per jin. He went to the workshop to ask the workers: "Will No. 12 do?" The workers replied that it would. He then bought a batch of No. 12 steel wire. Soon, the merchants learned that the factory had switched to using No. 12 steel wire, and immediately raised the price of No. 12 steel wire, from 7,000 yuan per jin to 11,000 yuan, while the price of No. 11 steel wire dropped to 7,000 yuan. Zhang Fengquan immediately decided to switch back to using No. 11. Some workers asked: Why are we changing back and forth? He explained: "Merchants want to speculate, the price has changed, and in order to prevent the country's property from being lost, we have to change too."
    Constantly educating and helping the comrades he leads is also a reason why Zhang Fengquan can do his job well. There were originally ten people in the supply and marketing section, two of whom were major embezzlers, and another four were dishonest, so the other comrades were also demoralized and afraid of making mistakes. Comrade Zhang Fengquan, through forums and individual talks, put forward the slogan "True gold fears no fire" to encourage everyone to work boldly. He gave serious criticism to those who were sluggish in their work. The purchasing agent Wang Xiheng did not complete his task well twice when purchasing timber. The first time, Zhang Fengquan asked him with concern if he had any difficulties. Wang Xiheng did not mention any difficulties. The second time, Wang Xiheng was afraid of the cold when loading the truck and did not check, resulting in a shortage of six cubic meters in 300 cubic meters of timber. Zhang Fengquan gave him serious criticism. Wang Xiheng was very moved, he said: "In the past, no one in the supply and marketing section ever helped me, so I was very sluggish in my work and never made any progress." The third time he went to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to transport pig iron, which was originally scheduled to be delivered by March 31, but he delivered it back on the 25th.
    Comrade Zhang Fengquan did not really understand the specific business of supply and marketing at first. But he has thirteen years of work experience and is very familiar with the basic business such as production processes and finished product specifications. What he doesn't understand is actually just some accounting and financial procedures and terms. This is generally the case with worker-cadres promoted from the workshops. Therefore, it is not factual to say that they do not understand the business in general terms. As long as they learn with an open mind and rely on the masses, the difficulties in their new work are not difficult to overcome. Comrade Zhang Fengquan is like this, he humbly asks other comrades for advice, and when others are off work, he is still pondering and studying alone. At the same time, he organized two comrades who were relatively skilled in business into a core group to study business and promote work. In this way, he actively learned and brought everyone's enthusiasm into play, and the difficulties were solved.
    Comrade Zhang Fengquan is a Communist Party member. He said: "In work, whenever I think of the Party and Chairman Mao, whenever I think of the prospects for national construction, whenever I think of our most beloved people in Korea, I get the energy, and no difficulties can stop me!"
    Such a high level of political consciousness is the most valuable characteristic of this kind of new person, and it is also the most powerful guarantee for them to be able to create a new situation and establish a new style in their new leadership positions.

    新人物，新作风
    ——记北京华北农业机器总厂新提拔的工人干部张凤泉
    新华社记者  任志樵
    “三反”运动以后，许多工人积极分子被提拔到了领导岗位上。有些人怀疑：他们胜任吗？让我们看北京华北农业机器总厂的张凤泉同志。他从车工场一个小组长被提拔为供销股股长，还不到三个月，职工们就夸奖他：“咱们老张，生产上是个好模范，供销上是个好主管。”
    当领导上刚刚宣布这个任命的时候，有些人确实是怀疑的。张凤泉高小程度还不到，又不懂供销业务，怎么干得了呢？但事实上他不但干好了，而且勇敢地打破了陈规，给供销工作带来了崭新的面貌。
    领导上交代任务时嘱咐过他：材料占生产总成本的百分之六十，要降低成本，材料的掌握是个大问题。他牢牢地记住了这段话。农业机器总厂做的都是定货，销路不成问题。供销股要做的主要是采购和供应材料。既要供应及时，不误生产，又要不积压资金，以免增大成本，这是这个工作的基本矛盾。由于对祖国建设事业的高度责任心，他把这个基本矛盾抓住了。
    他发现仓库里积压着大量的材料，其中甚至还有许多是一九四九年买来的。原来过去供销股买料，从不考虑什么积压资金，只要计划科送来计划，要多少就买多少，往往把一个季度甚至一年的材料一次买回来。至于贪污分子和奸商勾结，用高价买来了许多冷货，那就更不用说了。张凤泉想：堆材料就是堆钱哪，这怎么能降低成本？于是，他决心设法改变这个所谓“照令行事”的老规矩。
    有一次，计划科要买八百吨生铁。他知道已经给款还没有进货的有三百吨，仓库里还存着四百五十吨。三月份用去二百多吨，还剩五百多吨。因此，他征得计划科同意，只买了三百吨。仅仅这一笔，就少积压资金七亿元左右。
    既要向国家和人民负责，就要有勇气克服一切困难。当初，有些人不满意他这样“多事”。四月初，到东北去买的木料还没有到，木工场向计划科要求先在北京买三百立米木料做犁辕。但是在北京买价钱要比东北贵一倍。张凤泉同志接到这个任务，先了解了一下仓库的存量，知道里边还有二十万斤碎料，这些碎料，做犁辕还是可以的。他决心节省这一部分钱。第二天，他到木工场去动员工人同志用碎料。当时就有些人不满意，冷言冷语地说：“上级都同意了，你还来找麻烦？科长不抵你能？”木工场主管说：“误了生产你负责。”有的工人说：“老张！你刚离开车间，怎么就忘了生产？”张凤泉没有迁就这些同志。他耐心地向工人同志们介绍市场和供销的情况。他说：“我刚从车间里来，知道大家都爱用整料。原木确实好，用大用小很方便；碎料用起来，又费事，又受累。可是，咱们也得想想节约呀！如果不买这批料，就能节省五亿元还多，合小米五十多万斤。”工人同志们了解了这种情况，情绪立即高起来，大家都说这笔钱应该省，他们并且马上到仓库里去挑选。结果，这三千五百根犁辕的材料，都从碎料堆里找出来了。又有一次，计划科要买一百六十付丝锤，市场单价每付四十万元，总计得花六千四百万元。张凤泉发现仓库里还存着三百付。他想：他们明明知道有，为啥还买呢？可能因为这是自己厂里做的，没有西洋货好。可是至少两付也能顶一付使呀！这时，他便到螺丝场找组长和工人们研究。他告诉大家，如果用自己做的丝锤，可以给国家节省七万二千斤小米。工人一听这么大的数字，不但不要买了，并且还从自己工场的小仓库里找出了三十多付。
    从这些事实我们可以看到，张凤泉同志之所以把工作做得这样好，除了对国家和人民事业的高度责任心之外，还有一个十分重要的因素，这就是他在工作中能面向车间，依靠群众。他经常督促股里的同志分头深入车间，了解生产情况和要求。这一来，大家可忙了，不能再像过去那样整天坐在办公室里了。两架电话机整天不闲，供销股办公室也
    “热闹”起来，不断有工人来联系。供销股有些同志起初不大满意这种情况。有的说：“这么忙还行，以前不联系车间还不是一样工作！”有的说：“要是买上几个月的料，保险没有这些麻烦。”也有人对办公室的“热闹”不高兴：“这那像办公室，简直像个车间！”事实证明这些看法是错误的。工作不应该永远照老样子做下去。那些人很快就被张凤泉同志说服了。
    张凤泉同志在工作中发现领导有缺点，也勇于提出批评。比如四月初，铸工场要求买氧化铁三十吨；其实只要买十吨就够了。这主要是因为车间主管想多买些，用起来方便；并且怕像过去那样供应不及时，耽误生产。本来，这是可以审核出来的，可是计划书上生产科、计划科和经理科的科长们都盖了章，他们并没有仔细审查。张凤泉同志便向这些科长提意见，指出这样马马虎虎盖章，一下子就会积压好几亿元。科长们都虚心接受了这个批评。
    张凤泉同志在供销工作中，时刻提防不法商人钻空子。前些时候，钳工场要买一批十一号钢丝，商人故意抬价，每斤多要四、五千元。他便到车间去问工人：“十二号的行不行？”工人们回答说可以用。他便买了一批十二号钢丝。不久，商人们知道厂里改用了，马上把十二号钢丝的价钱提起来，从每斤七千元涨到一万一千元，十一号钢丝又降为七千元。张凤泉立即决定改用十一号。有些工人就问：为啥变来变去？他解释道：“商人想投机，价钱变了，我们为了国家财产不受损失，也得变。”
    经常教育和帮助自己所领导的同志，也是张凤泉能够把工作做好的原因。供销股原来有十个人，出了两个大贪污分子，另外有四个手脚不干净，因此其他几个同志也情绪不高，怕犯错误。张凤泉同志就通过座谈会和个别谈话，提出“真金不怕火炼”的口号，鼓励大家大胆工作。对于工作疲蹋的同志，他就给以严肃的批评。采购员王希垣采购木料，两次没有很好完成任务。第一次，张凤泉很关心地问他有什么困难没有？王希垣没有谈出什么困难来。第二次，王希垣在装车时怕冷，没有检查，结果三百立米木料中短了六立米。张凤泉很严肃地提出了批评。王希垣很受感动，他说：“过去在供销股工作，从来没有人帮助过我，所以工作起来很疲蹋，老没有进步。”第三次他到石景山钢铁厂运生铁，原限三月三十一日运到，他在二十五日就运回来了。
    供销方面的具体业务，张凤泉同志原来确实不懂。但是他有十三年的工龄，生产过程、成品规格等等基本业务，他是很熟悉的。他所不懂的，实际上只不过是会计和财务上的一些手续和名词罢了。从车间里提拔出来的工人干部，一般都是这样。所以笼统地说他们不懂业务，是不合事实的。只要虚心学习，依靠群众，他们在新的工作上的困难，不是很难克服的。张凤泉同志就是这样，他虚心请教别的同志，别人下班了，他一个人还在捉摸研究。同时，他又把业务上比较熟练的两个同志组织起来，成为一个核心组，经常研究业务，推动工作。这样，自己积极学习，又发挥了大家的积极性，困难就解决了。
    张凤泉同志是共产党员。他说：“在工作里，一想起党和毛主席，一想起祖国建设的远景，一想起在朝鲜的我们最可爱的人，劲头就来了，什么困难也挡我不住！”
    这样的高度的政治觉悟，便是这类新人物最可贵的特点，也是他们之所以能在新的领导的岗位上开创新局面，树立新作风的最有力的保证。
