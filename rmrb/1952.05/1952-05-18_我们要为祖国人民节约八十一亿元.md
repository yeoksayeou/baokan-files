    We Must Save 8.1 Billion Yuan for the People of the Motherland
    Volunteer Army Unit, Lu Dan
    Since last year, our unit has been carrying out a savings campaign, saving a lot on firewood, fodder, and heating expenses. The people of the motherland, in order to take care of the health of the Volunteer Army, have given us an extra three qian of oil and salt per person per day, and we have also saved this oil and salt money. We save this money not by not burning firewood, not heating, eating less oil and salt, or starving the animals; but by using our own labor to solve our own needs, saving money for the people of the motherland. For example, the soldiers take advantage of the gaps in combat to go up the mountains to collect firewood, burn charcoal, and cut fodder, not only supplying their own needs, but many units also have surpluses, which they give to the Korean people near the garrison who lack labor. Many comrades have used their brains and come up with many ways to save. For example, a certain team in the communications unit improved the way they use batteries, which saves 800,000 to 900,000 yuan per month in battery costs.
    This year, we are responding to the call of our superiors to save even more. All units have established savings plans. According to the statistics for our part alone, we can save the people of the motherland more than 8.11773 billion yuan. We hope that this money can be used in the construction of the motherland and add to the strength of our motherland.

    我们要为祖国人民节约八十一亿元
    志愿军某部　鲁旦
    从去年开始，我们部队就开展了节约运动，把柴火费、马草费、烤火费等都节省了不少。祖国人民为了照顾志愿军的健康，给我们每人每天增发三钱油盐，我们把这笔油盐费也省下来了。我们省下这些钱，并不是不烧柴、不烤火、少吃油盐或者让牲口饿肚子；而是用自己的劳动解决自己的需要，给祖国人民把钱省下来的。比如，战士们利用战斗的空隙，上山去打柴、烧炭、打马草，不独供给了自己的需要，许多单位还有剩余，把剩余的送给了驻地附近缺乏劳动力的朝鲜人民。许多同志开动脑筋，想出了许多节约的办法。例如通讯部队某队改进了使用电池的方法，每月就可从电池费用中节省出八、九十万元。
    今年，我们响应上级的号召，要节约更多的东西。各单位都订立了节约计划。仅我们这一部分的统计，就可以给祖国人民节省八十一亿一千七百七十三万余元。我们希望这笔钱能够用在祖国的建设事业上，为我们的祖国增添一分力量。
