    Rainfall generally abundant in various regions in April, greatly benefiting this year's agricultural production
    April is the main season for sowing various crops. The rainfall this month was generally abundant across the country. Only the Yangtze River basin along the river experienced slightly less rainfall than in previous years, and eastern Gansu and northern Hebei also had slightly lower rainfall than in previous years. The total rainfall in the Northeast regions all exceeded 25 mm (each "shi cun" is equivalent to 33.3 mm). The total rainfall in Jilin and western Liaoning provinces exceeded 50 mm, equivalent to one to one and a half times the rainfall in April of previous years. The rainfall in various parts of North China in April was generally around 25 mm, slightly less in the plains and slightly more in the mountains, not far from the historical average. In the Northwest, except for a few places, the rainfall in April was all below 10 mm. In the East China region, north of the Yangtze River, the rainfall in April was between 25 and 50 mm; south of the Yangtze River, the rainfall was very high, with Zhejiang receiving about 100 mm and Fujian receiving over 300 mm, more than double that of previous years. In the Central South region, the rainfall distribution in April was roughly the same as in East China. North of the Yangtze River, it was between 50 and 100 mm, and south of the Yangtze River, it was over 200 mm. However, the rainfall in the coastal areas of Guangdong in April was not abundant, only below 100 mm. In the Southwest region, except for Guizhou Province, which received over 100 mm of rainfall in April, most areas received less than 50 mm, roughly equal to the average rainfall in April of previous years. The abundant rainfall in April is of great benefit to this year's agricultural production. Last year, North China had difficulty planting cotton due to the lack of rain in April. This year, cotton fields in most parts of North China have already been sown. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四月份各地雨量一般较丰
    对今年农业生产有很大的好处
    四月是各种农作物播种的主要季节，本月全国雨量一般都相当丰富，只有长江流域沿江一带比较往年略少，甘肃东部和河北北部全月雨量也稍低于往年。东北各地全月雨量的总量都在二十五公厘（每市寸合三十三点三公厘）以上。吉林、辽西两省全月雨量超过了五十公厘，相当于往年四月份雨量的一倍到一倍半。华北各地四月份雨量大致在二十五公厘左右，平原地区稍少而山地略多，和历年平均数相去不远。西北除少数地方而外，四月份雨量都在十公厘以下。华东区长江以北地区，四月份雨量在二十五到五十公厘之间；长江以南雨量很大，浙江约一百公厘，福建在三百公厘以上，超过往年一倍多。中南区四月份雨量分布情况，大体和华东相同。长江以北在五十到一百公厘之间，长江以南在二百公厘以上。不过广东沿海地带四月份雨量不丰，只在一百公厘以下。西南区四月份雨量除贵州省在一百公厘以上而外，大部地区都不到五十公厘，和历年四月平均雨量大抵相等。四月雨量较丰，对于今年农业生产有极大的好处。去年华北曾因四月缺雨种棉困难，今年华北大部地区的棉田都已播种了。    （新华社）
