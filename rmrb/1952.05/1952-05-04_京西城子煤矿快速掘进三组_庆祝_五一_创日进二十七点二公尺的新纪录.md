    The Fast Tunneling Team Three of Jingxi Chengzijiao Coal Mine
    Celebrates New Record of 27.2 Meters Progress Per Day on "May Day"
    To the Editor: Workers of the Beijing Jingxi Mining Bureau celebrated the "May Day" Labor Day by entering a hot production competition. On April 25th, the daily output of the Chengzijiao Mine broke through 1,000 tons, reaching a new record of 1,163.2 tons. The workers of the fast tunneling team three in the mine had an even more ardent production mood. They absorbed the advanced production experience of the Ma Liuhai team, appropriately allocated labor, and adopted a cyclical operation production method. On the 25th and 26th, they successively created the highest record of 25.7 meters and 27.2 meters of coal lane tunneling in the Jingxi mining area. This new record, after being transmitted from the mine to the entire mining area, gave everyone great encouragement. The team is prepared to continue to create greater achievements. Gao Judao

    庆祝“五一”创日进二十七点二公尺的新纪录
    编辑同志：北京京西矿务局职工，庆祝“五一”劳动节，进入生产竞赛热潮。城子矿四月二十五日日产量突破一千吨，达到一千一百六十三点二吨的新纪录。该矿快速掘进三组工人，生产情绪更为炽烈。他们吸取马六孩小组的先进生产经验，适当地配备了劳动力，采取了循环作业的生产方法，二十五、六两日先后创造日进二十五点七公尺、二十七点二公尺的京西矿区煤巷掘进最高纪录。这一新纪录从井下传到全矿区后，给大家以莫大的鼓舞。该组准备继续创造更大的成绩。  高具刀
