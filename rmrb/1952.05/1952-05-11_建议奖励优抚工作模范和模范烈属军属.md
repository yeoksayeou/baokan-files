    Suggest Rewarding Model Workers in Preferential Treatment and Model Families of Martyrs and Servicemen
    Editor: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government rewarded the model agricultural patriots for bumper harvests in 1951, which had a great impact on the patriotic bumper harvest movement in 1952. Therefore, I thought of the issue of rewarding model workers in preferential treatment and model families of martyrs and servicemen.
    Since the inspection of preferential treatment work after the "August 1st" Army Day in 1951, due to the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses, the preferential treatment work in various parts of the country has improved to varying degrees. The preferential treatment work in some areas has made rapid progress. The progress in the work of farming on behalf of others in rural areas is even greater. Many "model farmers" and "model supporters of the army and preferential treatment" have emerged among the broad masses. Many families of martyrs and servicemen, deeply moved by the warm love and care of the masses, actively participated in labor, overcame the idea of simply relying on the government and the masses, and played a backbone and leading role in paying public grain and other tasks. The families of servicemen wrote letters to their loved ones at the front, encouraging them to defend the motherland. Many model families of martyrs and servicemen have emerged in many places.
    In order to consolidate and enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for preferential treatment work, and to continue to encourage the families of martyrs and servicemen to play an active role in production, I suggest that the relevant leading departments, based on the situation of preferential treatment work across the country, formulate reward measures for model workers in preferential treatment and model families of martyrs and servicemen, and hope to award the first batch of awards before this year's "August 1st" Army Day. This will surely rapidly advance the national preferential treatment work.

    Editor's Note: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government believes that Comrade Fang Qing's suggestion is very good and will prepare to do so.

    建议奖励优抚工作模范和模范烈属军属
    编辑同志：中央人民政府农业部奖励了一九五一年的农业爱国丰产模范，这对一九五二年的爱国丰产运动发生了极大的作用。因此，我联想到关于奖励优抚工作模范和模范烈属军属的问题。
    自一九五一年“八一”建军节检查优抚工作之后，由于广大群众的政治觉悟不断提高，全国各地的优抚工作在不同的程度上都有改进。有些地区的优抚工作是突飞猛进的。农村代耕工作方面的进步更大。在广大群众中出现了不少“代耕模范”和“拥军优属模范”。许多烈属军属因为受到群众的热烈爱戴和照顾，深受感动，积极参加劳动，克服了单纯依靠政府和群众的思想，在缴纳公粮等工作中起了骨干、带头作用。军属们给在前方的亲人写信，鼓励他们保卫祖国。许多地方出现了模范烈属和军属。
    为了巩固和提高群众对优抚工作的积极性，为了继续鼓舞烈属军属在生产上发挥积极性，我建议有关领导部门，根据全国优抚工作的情况，制订对优抚模范和模范烈属军属的奖励办法，并希望能在今年“八一”建军节之前，颁发第一批奖。这样，一定会使全国优抚工作迅速地向前推进一步。

    编者按：中央人民政府内务部认为方庆同志的建议很好，将准备这样做。
