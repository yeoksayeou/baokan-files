Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd — On April 30th, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a grand meeting in Zhangjiakou to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Attending the meeting were representatives specially sent by the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government to offer congratulations, representatives from the People's Government of Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City, and cadres from various agencies of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region stationed in Zhangjiakou, totaling 2,000 people.

Ulanhu, Chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, summarized the basic experiences and achievements of the Inner Mongolian people in implementing regional autonomy over the past five years in his speech. Ulanhu said: Because we have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of national regional autonomy, the Inner Mongolian people have realized their long-standing urgent demands to eliminate foreign national oppression and internal feudal oppression, established a national autonomous region and the People's Government of the autonomous region, giving the once-disaster-ridden Inner Mongolian people the possibility and conditions for prosperity and development. Moreover, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, as well as the help of advanced brotherly nationalities, the face of the Inner Mongolian people is undergoing tremendous changes. We have greatly developed agricultural and pastoral production. In agriculture, we have already surpassed the pre-liberation level; in animal husbandry, the number of livestock has now increased nearly twofold compared to the time of liberation. The relations between the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia region have become increasingly united and consolidated. After practical and profound education in patriotism and internationalism through the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the patriotic and internationalist spirit of the people throughout the region has soared to unprecedented heights.

Finally, Ulanhu pointed out: The changes in all aspects of the Inner Mongolia region over the past five years are due to the correct implementation of the great national policy of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. In the various constructions of Inner Mongolia in the future, in addition to the active efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, it is still necessary to obtain the help of the Han nationality in order to achieve complete victory. To this end, he called on the people and cadres throughout the region to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, further strengthen unity, and complete the various construction tasks of the autonomous region in the future.

At the commemorative meeting, Peng Zemin and Wang Baozhen, representatives of the Political and Legal Committee of the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government, Liu Xiufeng, Deputy Director of the North China Administrative Committee, Sa Kongliao, representative of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Yang Gengtian, Chairman of the People's Government of Chahar Province, delivered congratulatory speeches successively.

The meeting concluded after passing a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. After the meeting, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a banquet to entertain the representatives and guests who came to offer congratulations.

    内蒙古自治区人民政府举行大会
    隆重纪念自治区成立五周年
    中央人民政府政务院代表致词祝贺
    【新华社张家口二日电】四月三十日，内蒙古自治区人民政府在张家口隆重地举行了内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五周年的纪念大会。参加大会的有中央人民政府政务院特派前来祝贺的代表，察哈尔省和张家口市人民政府的代表，以及内蒙古自治区驻张家口各机关的干部共二千人。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府主席乌兰夫在讲话中，总结了五年来内蒙古民族实行区域自治的基本经验和成就。乌兰夫说：由于我们执行了毛主席的民族区域自治政策，内蒙古民族实现了多年来扫除外来的民族压迫和内部的封建压迫的迫切要求，建立了民族自治区和自治区人民政府，使过去灾难深重的内蒙古民族有了繁荣发展的可能和条件。而且由于毛主席和中央人民政府的领导，以及先进兄弟民族的帮助，内蒙古民族的面貌正起着巨大的变化。我们大大发展了农业和牧业生产。在农业上已超过了解放前的水平；在牧业上，现在牲畜的数量，已比解放时增加将近一倍。内蒙古地区各民族人民的关系已日益团结和巩固。全区人民经过抗美援朝的爱国主义与国际主义的实际而深刻的教育之后，爱国主义与国际主义精神已空前高涨。
    最后，乌兰夫指出：内蒙古地区五年来各方面的变化，是由于正确执行了毛主席和共产党的伟大的民族政策。今后在内蒙古的各种建设中，除了自治区各民族人民的积极努力外，仍然需要取得汉民族的帮助，才能够取得彻底的胜利。为此，他号召全区人民和全区干部戒骄戒躁，更进一步地亲密团结，完成自治区今后的各项建设任务。
    在纪念大会上，中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会代表彭泽民、王葆真、华北行政委员会副主任刘秀峰、中央人民政府民族事务委员会代表萨空了等和察哈尔省人民政府主席杨耕田，都先后致贺辞。大会宣读了中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理、政务院政治法律委员会董必武主任、政务院华北行政委员会主任刘澜涛和中央人民政府民族事务委员会等祝贺自治区成立五周年的贺电。大会在通过向毛主席、周总理和中国人民志愿军的致敬电后结束。会后，内蒙古自治区人民政府举行宴会，招待前来祝贺的代表和来宾。
