What has the "Five-Anti" campaign brought to Beijing's private industry and commerce? What has it added and what has it reduced? Yesterday, I encountered a few interesting things.

	Early in the morning, on Wangfujing Street, Gui Yongchun, a thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer, told me: his mother gave him five hundred yuan RMB to buy a "Good Student" brand pencil at a stationery store. When the store clerk handed him the pencil, he took the pencil with his right hand and threw the five hundred yuan RMB on the counter with his left hand and walked out. But he was immediately called back by the clerk.

	"I didn't give you less money! Last time I bought them for five hundred yuan apiece!" Gui Yongchun explained uneasily to the clerk.

	"'Good Student' brand pencils only cost four hundred yuan." The clerk said with a smile, and handed one hundred yuan back to Gui Yongchun. He also said to Gui Yongchun: "After the 'Five-Anti' campaign, the price of stationery has been reduced. Because our boss doesn't dare to seek illegal profits anymore."

	In the afternoon, I was talking with the manager in a hardware store on Damochang Street when a middle-aged woman, dressed elegantly, brought a naive girl and pushed the door open, asking the clerk to buy a "Genuine Wang Mazi" small knife. The clerk replied directly: "We don't have it." The woman retorted: "Isn't your store a long-established store selling Wang Mazi knives?" The clerk replied: "That's right. Even now, we still have 'Genuine Wang Mazi' knives in our display case. But those are fake. To be honest, all the 'Wang Mazi' knives and scissors sold in Beijing hardware stores are fake. After the 'Five-Anti' campaign, we can no longer do deceptive things."

	Passing off fakes as genuine, openly stealing and secretly calculating, this was the "way to make money" for ordinary private industrialists and merchants before the "Five-Anti" campaign. Anyone who didn't do this would be considered a complete fool by some people. But now, this bad practice is beginning to be replaced by good practices.

	Yihua Musical Instrument Store is a shop with a capital of ninety million yuan and a storefront only one and a half zhang wide. However, last year alone, it did twenty billion yuan in turnover; the profit obtained was at least 50% and as high as 300%. At the entrance of the repair room of this store, there is a three-inch wide piece of paper with the words: "This is an important repair area, please stop unless authorized." Why is this "repair room" not allowed to be entered? The reason is that the manager, Zhang Huanyao, often plays tricks here. Zhang Huanyao grasped the psychology of some customers who blindly liked foreign goods, and often electroplated old musical instruments and engraved foreign brand names on them. Now he has changed, and he no longer does this kind of thing. He took out a brass horn with the brand name "Bosi" from the cabinet and told me that this horn was originally made in Shanghai, and the words "Bosi" and "Made in London" were completely faked by him. Now he has reduced the price from 8 million yuan to 4.61 million yuan, and added the words "Refurbished" to the brand name.

	In a hutong, there is a tailor shop called "Rui Tongji". The manager, Rui Tongji, is now doing things completely different from three months ago. Three months ago, when he undertook to make uniforms, he stole between six inches and one foot of fabric per garment. At that time, he regarded this behavior as a matter of course and did not think it was wrong. "It's not a tailor shop if you don't steal fabric," this is generally known. Now he has changed. He returns all the remaining fabric (including the cut-off strips) to the original owner. In the past, he used bad cotton thread when sewing, but now he has switched to good spool thread.

	Some merchants in the Wangfujing Department Store and the Dong'an Market have always used various kinds of flowery words to deceive customers. If you go to buy a pair of sky blue or light blue socks, the store clerks will tell you categorically: "Absolutely does not fade." When you want to buy a suitcase, the owner will pat his chest and guarantee to you: "This box is made of cowhide." Now, this set of deceptive tricks has been exposed. "Absolutely does not fade" socks often fade as soon as they are washed; many cowhide suitcases are horsehide suitcases, and horsehide suitcases are often sheepskin suitcases. Many merchants have told customers the various deceptive secrets of the past, and expressed that they will never deceive people again. This new atmosphere, although only just beginning, is welcome.

### “五反”运动后北京街头二三事

    “五反”运动后北京街头二三事
    李翼
    “五反”运动给北京的私营工商业带来了什么呢？它使北京的私营工商业增添了什么，减少了什么呢？昨天，我遇到几件有趣的事情。
    清晨，在王府井大街，十三岁的少年儿童队员桂永春对我说：他妈妈给他五百元人民币，要他到文具店去买一支“好学生”牌铅笔。当文具店的店员递给他铅笔时，他右手接过铅笔，左手把五百元人民币朝着柜台一放就往外走。但他立刻被店员喊了回来。
    “我没有少给你钱！上次我买的都是五百元一支呀！”桂永春不安地向店员解释。
    “‘好学生’牌铅笔有四百元就够了。”店员含笑说着，随手把一百元退给了桂永春。并对桂永春说：“‘五反’以后，文具的价钱降低了。因为我们掌柜的不敢再贪图非法利润了。”
    下午，我正在打磨厂街一家五金号里和经理谈话，一位衣着讲究的中年妇女携带着一个稚气的女孩子推门进来，向店员购买“真正王麻子”小刀。店员直接了当地答道：“没有。”那位妇女反问：“你家不是卖王麻子小刀的老字号吗？”店员答道：“不错。就是现在我们的货橱里也还有‘真正王麻子’小刀。可是那是假的。老实告诉你，北京所有五金号出售的‘王麻子’刀剪，都是假的。经过‘五反’，骗人的事我们不能再做了。”
    以假顶真，明偷暗算，这是“五反”前一般私营工商户的“生财之道”。谁不这样做，那就会被某些人认为是十足的傻瓜。但是，现在这种坏风气开始由好的风气来代替了。
    艺华乐器商行，是一个资金九千万元，门面仅有一丈半宽的铺子。但是，去年一年就做了二十亿元流水的买卖；获得的利润，最低是百分之五十，最高达百分之三百。在这个商行的修理室的门口，贴着一个三寸宽的纸条，上写：“此处系修理重地，非经同意请止步。”这个“修理室”为什么不让人进去呢？原因是经理张焕尧经常在这儿做鬼。张焕尧抓住某些主顾盲目地喜欢外国货的心理，时常把旧的乐器镀电加工，刻上外国牌号。现在他变了，他不再干这勾当了。他从柜橱里拿出一只牌名“波夕”的铜号给我看，并告诉我，这只号原是上海做的，牌名“波夕”和“伦敦制”等字样，完全是他假做的。现在他已把八百万元的定价降为四百六十一万元，并在牌名上加刻了“翻修”二字。
    在一条胡同里，有一个名叫“芮同吉”的成衣局。经理芮同吉，现在做着和三个月前完全两样的事。三个月以前，他承做制服，每身偷减布料六寸到一尺不等。他在那时候把这种行为看做理所当然，并不以为不对。“不偷布就不算成衣局”，这是一般人们都知道的。现在他变了。他把所有剩余的布料（包括裁下的布条子）都送还给原主。过去缝衣时使用坏棉线，现在已经改用好的轮轴线了。
    王府井的大百货店和东安市场里的一些商人，历来都是用各种各样的花言巧语哄骗主顾的。你如果去买一双天蓝色或浅蓝色的袜子，商店的售货员们会斩钉截铁地告诉你：“绝不褪色。”当你要买一只皮箱时，掌柜的会拍着胸脯向你保证：“这箱子是牛皮的”。现在，这套骗人的把戏被戳穿了。“绝不褪色”的袜子常常是一洗就褪色的；许多牛皮箱是马皮箱，而马皮箱常常是羊皮箱。不少商人已把过去各种骗人的秘密告诉主顾，表示以后绝不再骗人了。这种新的气象，虽然还只是开始，但它是值得欢迎的。
