    Elementary School Students Love "Chinese Young Pioneers"
    Comrade Editor: The "June 1st" International Children's Day is coming soon. What gifts should parents give to children? I am reflecting a request from elementary school students here, and I would like teachers and parents to consider it.
    The students of the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University deeply love "Chinese Young Pioneers" because "Chinese Young Pioneers" is a good friend and mentor to children. It can help children correct their shortcomings and cultivate new moral qualities. To give a few examples: During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements,
    "Chinese Young Pioneers" promptly put forward the call for children to achieve "Three Wants and Three Don'ts"
    (Want to protect public property, want to live plainly, want to cherish time; Don't harm public interests to benefit oneself, don't waste, don't be greedy for petty advantages and steal other people's things.) This call played a great educational role for children.
    In the past, some children did not cherish public property, and school desks, chairs, and other public items were often damaged. After educating the children to cherish public property, they would repair broken chairs themselves. One class of children voluntarily covered all the books in the school library. There are many similar examples.
    "Chinese Young Pioneers" often publishes heroic stories about the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, which are the children's favorite readings. These stories have a great influence on them. Guiding children to learn from the newspaper can cultivate children's research spirit and creative genius. For example, some children read the methods of making slides published in the newspaper, and they experimented with them, resulting in great success. These all show that "Chinese Young Pioneers" is of great help to children.
    Children deeply love the Young Pioneers newspaper. Every Monday, they chase after the teachers and ask, "Has the newspaper arrived?" After the newspapers are distributed to them, they read them eagerly and thoroughly from beginning to end, word for word, and start discussions. I often hear children say:
    "Can you lend me the Young Pioneers newspaper to read?" Some children save the money for snacks to subscribe to the newspaper. The children are eager to have their own newspaper. For this reason, I suggest that parents try their best to meet the children's demands and subscribe to children's newspapers as gifts for the children on "June 1st". Schools should strengthen the leadership of reading newspapers so that children can get more education from them.

### 小学生喜爱“中国少年报”

    小学生喜爱“中国少年报”
    编辑同志：“六一”国际儿童节就要到了，家长应该给儿童送些什么礼物呢？我在这里反映小学生们的一个要求，请教师和家长们考虑。
    北京师范第二附小的学生们，是十分热爱“中国少年报”的，因为“中国少年报”是儿童们的好朋友和导师，它能够帮助儿童改正缺点，培养儿童新的道德品质。举些例子来说吧：在“三反”“五反”运动中，
    “中国少年报”及时提出儿童要做到“三要三不要”
    （要爱护公共财产，要生活朴素，要爱惜时间；不要损公利己，不要浪费，不要贪小便宜偷窃别人的东西。）的号召，对儿童起了很大的教育作用。
    过去有些孩子不爱护公共财物，学校里的桌椅及其他公共物品，经常被损坏了。对儿童进行了爱护公物的教育以后，他们看到椅子快坏了，就自己修钉。有一个班的孩子，自动把学校图书馆的书籍都包上了书皮。类似的例子是很多的。
    “中国少年报”经常刊载有关志愿军和朝鲜人民军的英雄故事，这是儿童最喜欢阅读的。这些故事对于他们的影响很大。引导儿童学习报纸，可以培养儿童的研究精神和创造天才。比如，有的儿童看了报上登载的制造幻灯片的方法，他们就进行试验，结果成绩很好。这些都说明“中国少年报”对儿童的帮助是很大的。
    孩子们十分热爱少年报。他们每到星期一，就追着教师问：“报纸来了没有？”等到把报纸发给他们以后，他们就如饥如渴地、一字不漏地从头看到尾，并且展开讨论。我常常听到孩子们这样说：
    “你借我少年报看看吧”。有的孩子节省下买零食的钱来订报。儿童们是渴望着自己有一份报纸的。为此，我建议家长们尽可能满足孩子们的要求，给孩子们订阅少年儿童报作为在“六一”节送给孩子们的礼物。学校方面则应加强对读报工作的领导，使孩子们从中得到更多的教育。
