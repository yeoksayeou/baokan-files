    Peking University Engineering College Conducts Current Affairs Quiz to Promote Newspaper Reading

    To the Editor: In mid-May, our college held a current affairs quiz.  The participants included all professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, students, and some staff, totaling 541 people.  The results of the quiz showed that the average score was only 52 points per person.  Some people's answers were full of errors.  For example, they said the world's four great cultural figures were "Mao Dun, Guo Moruo, Lu Xun, and Li Dazhao"; the International Economic Conference was held in "Oslo" and "Vienna"; the key issue preventing progress in the Korean negotiations was "the issue of treaty ports, with the United States wanting to transport goods to Korea." More than 50 people didn't even know about the Huai River harnessing project and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion project currently underway in our country.

    Why were the quiz results so bad? Most people were too busy with the "Three-Anti" campaign to take the time to read the newspaper; some people did not sufficiently recognize the importance of reading the newspaper and simply didn't want to read it; some people felt that reading the newspaper would not solve the difficulties they encountered in their current work and study, so they didn't read it either.  Clearly, these are all manifestations of a lack of concern for politics.

    The results of this current affairs quiz served as a wake-up call for everyone.  The school's administrative leadership and the student union have begun to pay attention to strengthening leadership in current affairs study.  Recently, the student union, through broadcasts in the dining hall, emphasized the significance of reading newspapers and held a current affairs exhibition, using concise text, charts, and cartoons to comprehensively introduce the current international situation.  Now, newspaper reading groups have been universally established throughout the college, laying the foundation for in-depth current affairs study in the future.

### 北京大学工学院进行时事测验推动读报工作

    北京大学工学院进行时事测验推动读报工作
    编辑同志：五月中旬，我院举行了一次时事测验。参加这次测验的有全院的教授、讲师、助教、学生，及一部分职员，共计五百四十一人。测验结果，平均每人只得五十二分。有些人的答案错误百出。如说世界四大文化名人是：“茅盾、郭沫若、鲁迅、李大钊”；国际经济会议是在“奥斯陆”、
    “维也纳”召开的；朝鲜谈判不能进展的关键问题，是“由于通商口岸问题，美国要把物资运往朝鲜”。有五十多人连目前我国正在进行着的治淮工程和荆江分洪工程也不知道。
    为什么测验结果这样坏呢？大部分人是由于“三反”工作忙碌，没有抓紧时间读报；也有些人是因为对读报的重要性认识不足，根本不想读报；有些人觉得阅读报纸解决不了他当前的工作与学习中所存在的困难，所以也不读报。很明显的，这些都是不关心政治的表现。
    这次时事测验的结果，给大家敲了一次警钟。学校行政领导方面和学生会都已开始注意加强时事学习的领导工作。最近，学生会通过饭厅广播，着重说明了读报的意义，举办了时事展览会，用简明的文字、图表、漫画等形式，全面地介绍了目前的国际情势。现在，全院已普遍成立了读报组，为今后深入展开时事学习打下了基础。
