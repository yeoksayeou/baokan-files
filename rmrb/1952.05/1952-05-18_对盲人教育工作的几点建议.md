    Several Suggestions on Education for the Blind
    Comrade Editor: I agree with the points raised by Comrade Huang Nai in his article "Suggestions on Education for the Blind" published in the People's Daily on March 14. Here, I would like to offer a few additional suggestions: 1. Provide the blind with the opportunity to audit classes in regular schools. Due to various limitations, our country cannot yet conduct large-scale education for the blind. Most general schools do not admit blind students, which prevents many blind school graduates and those who become blind later in life from continuing their education. However, they also need to constantly improve themselves and advance with society, just like ordinary people. Therefore, I suggest that regular schools also accept blind auditors, so that ordinary blind people can also receive secondary or higher education. 2. Within an appropriate scope, absorb blind people into the workforce as much as possible. In the old society, blind people were discriminated against and oppressed, and they found it difficult to find legitimate jobs. As a result, many blind people made a living by fortune-telling, and some begged on the streets. They suffered hunger, cold, humiliation, and persecution. In the new China of the people, blind people should also have the opportunity to use their intelligence and creativity, just like ordinary people, to serve the people and the construction of the motherland. 3. Vigorously strengthen political education for the staff of existing blind schools and other educational institutions for the blind. 4. Broadcasting equipment should be universally installed in all blind schools and other educational institutions for the blind, so that they can regularly receive current affairs education. 5. Trial manufacture of Braille printing presses. This is a prerequisite for the large-scale publication and distribution of new Braille books, periodicals, and newspapers.

### 对盲人教育工作的几点建议

    对盲人教育工作的几点建议
    编辑同志：三月十四日人民日报刊登了黄乃同志的“关于盲人教育工作的建议”一文。我同意他所提出的几点意见。在这里我再提几点补充建议：一、给盲人以进入普通学校旁听的机会。由于各种条件的限制，目前我国还不能大规模地开展盲人教育工作。一般学校又多不招收盲生，这使许多盲校毕业生以及后天失明的盲人，都不能继续得到求学的机会。但是，也需要和普通人一样，不断地提高自己，随着社会的前进而前进。因此我建议普通学校兼收盲人旁听生，使一般盲人也能受到中等或高等教育。二、在适当的范围内，尽量吸收盲人参加工作。盲人在旧社会中是受歧视受压迫的，他们很难找到正当的职业。因此有不少盲人以占卦为业，有些沿街行乞。他们受尽了饥寒、凌辱和迫害。在人民的新中国，盲人应该也像普通人一样，得到发挥智慧和创造才能的机会，以便为人民、为祖国的建设事业服务。三、对旧有的盲校及其他盲人教育机关的工作人员，大力加强政治教育。四、在各盲校及其他盲人教育机关，应普遍装置播音器，使他们经常受到时事教育。五、试制盲文印书机。这是大量出版发行盲文新书、期刊、报纸的先决条件。
