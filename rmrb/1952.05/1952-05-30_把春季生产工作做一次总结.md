    Summarize Spring Production Work
    After completing the spring plowing and sowing, the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative immediately held a meeting for summary and conducted a mass appraisal using democratic methods. During the summary and appraisal process, they affirmed their achievements, further recognized the superiority of collective production, strengthened their confidence in continuing to move forward, strengthened internal unity, and on this basis, formulated a summer production plan, pushing the patriotic production increase campaign a step forward.
    At the end of the agricultural production phase, timely summaries and appraisals are an indispensable part of deeply carrying out the patriotic production increase campaign. This year, farmers in various regions enthusiastically participated in the patriotic bumper harvest competition, making this year's spring plowing and sowing work generally better than in previous years. Many advanced agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have done even better. Their achievements and experiences should be summarized and improved. In some areas, the patriotic bumper harvest competition has not been carried out well enough, and the spring production plan has not been completed well. These areas should also conduct a summary and appraisal to learn from the experiences and lessons and do a good job in the summer production work.
    In a letter to labor models and farmers across the country who challenged them, members of the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative described their summary of spring plowing and sowing and asked everyone to summarize their production achievements and experiences and publish them in the newspaper. This is of great help in exchanging experiences and promoting the bumper harvest movement. We hope that labor models and mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various regions can do the same.

    把春季生产工作做一次总结
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社，在完成春耕播种之后，立即开会进行总结，并且运用民主方式进行了群众性的评比。他们在总结和评比的过程中，肯定了自己的成就，进一步认识了集体生产的优越性，增强了继续前进的信心，加强了内部的团结，并在这个基础上订出了夏季的生产计划，把爱国增产竞赛运动向前推进了一步。
    在农业生产告一段落的时候，适时地进行总结和评比，是深入开展爱国增产竞赛运动的不可缺少的一个环节。今年各地农民踊跃地参加了爱国丰产竞赛运动，使今年的春耕播种工作，一般比往年作得好。许多先进的农业生产合作社和互助组，作得更好。他们的成绩和经验，应该加以总结和提高。有些地区的爱国丰产竞赛开展得不够好，没有很好地完成春季生产计划。这些地区也应该进行一次总结、评比，以便从中吸取经验教训，把夏季生产工作切实做好。
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社社员在给全国各地向他们应战的劳动模范和农民们的信中，叙述了他们总结春耕播种的情况，并要求大家把生产中的成绩和经验加以总结，在报上发表。这对于交流经验、推动丰产运动是有很大作用的，我们希望各地劳动模范和互助合作组织都能够这样做。
