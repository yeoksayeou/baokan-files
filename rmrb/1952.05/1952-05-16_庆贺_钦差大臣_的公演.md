    Celebrating the Premiere of "The Government Inspector"
    Liao Chengzhi
    The Chinese people love their own artistic heritage, and similarly, the Chinese people also love the artistic heritage of other nations. Gogol's name is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. During the darkest years of the past three decades, the Chinese people loved Gogol and loved his "The Government Inspector" because the suffering of the Chinese people at that time was so similar to the suffering of the Russian people.
    The reason why the Chinese people loved "The Government Inspector" so much in the past was because the Chinese people's hate and love were exactly the same as the Russian people's hate and love; on one side was Chiang Kai-shek, on the other side was the Tsar; on one side was feudalism, on the other side were the serf owners; on one side was bureaucratic capitalism, on the other side were the decadent and corrupt nobles and merchants. In the dark ages, Chinese playwrights with a sense of justice overcame many difficulties and performed "The Government Inspector," increasing the audience's hatred of the dark forces and increasing the audience's confidence and courage in the future.
    More than two years after the victory of the Chinese revolution, in our capital, with completely different feelings and in a completely different environment, "The Government Inspector," beloved by the Russian people and beloved by the Chinese people, was performed again. When we see this performance now, love and hate will also burn in our hearts; however, this is already a mood of looking back on the past love and hate. With the victory of the revolution, the dark rule that Gogol hated—the dark rule that we hated—has been sent to the grave by the people forever.
    However, in the world, figures similar to those in "The Government Inspector" still occupy a ruling position in some countries, and the people there do not even have the right to perform "The Government Inspector." However, we believe that the love and hate in their hearts must be exactly the same as the love and hate in our hearts at that time and the love and hate in the hearts of the Russian people in those years.
    The people who perform "The Government Inspector" with the joy of victory and the mood of reviewing the past have the responsibility and obligation to help the people who live in the era of "The Government Inspector" and who do not even have the right to perform "The Government Inspector."
    It is gratifying that the Beijing drama circles performed "The Government Inspector" in the centenary of Gogol's death, and I congratulate them on their success.

    庆贺“钦差大臣”的公演
    廖承志
    中国人民热爱着自己的艺术遗产，同样的中国人民也热爱别的民族的艺术遗产。果戈理的名字对于中国人民并不是陌生的，在过去三十年来最黑暗的年月中，中国人民喜爱果戈理，喜爱他的“钦差大臣”，因为当时中国人民所受的痛苦和俄罗斯人民所受的痛苦，是如此相同。
    中国人民在过去的年代中这样喜爱“钦差大臣”，就是因为中国人民的恨和爱是和俄罗斯人民的恨和爱完全相似；一方面是蒋介石，一方面是沙皇；一方面是封建主义，一方面是农奴主；一方面是官僚资本主义，一方面是荒淫腐朽的贵族和商人。在黑暗的时代里，中国的有正义感的戏剧工作者，曾经克服了许多困难，演出了“钦差大臣”，增加了观众对黑暗势力的憎恨，增加了观众对未来的信心和勇气。
    中国革命胜利后两年多，在我国的首都，以完全不同的心情和在完全不同的环境下，从新演出了俄罗斯人民所心爱的和中国人民所心爱的“钦差大臣”。我们现在看了这个演出，心里同样也会燃烧起了爱和恨；然而，这已经是回顾过去的爱和恨的心情了，随着革命的胜利，果戈理所痛恨的——我们所痛恨的黑暗统治，已被人民永远送到坟墓里去了。
    然而，在世界上，类似“钦差大臣”中的人物还在某些国家里占统治地位，那儿的人民连演出“钦差大臣”的权利也没有。但是，我们相信，他们心里的爱和恨也一定和当时我们心里的爱和恨和俄罗斯人民当年心里的爱和恨完全一样。
    以胜利的欢乐回顾过去的心情，来演出“钦差大臣”的人民，有责任和义务去帮助生活在“钦差大臣”时代和连演出“钦差大臣”的权利都没有的人民。
    北京话剧界，在果戈理逝世百年纪念中演出了“钦差大臣”是可喜的事情，我祝贺他们成功。
