    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Shaanxi Daily Call for the Development of 60,000 Reading Groups Before the End of June
    The Propaganda Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Shaanxi Daily recently issued a call to all local prefectural and county committees in the province to launch a reading group campaign during the three months of April, May, and June. The call pointed out: Last year, the Provincial Committee proposed a plan to establish 40,000 reading groups throughout the province, which was completed and exceeded by the end of the year. To further promote mass newspaper reading and study, the Provincial Committee requires that 60,000 reading groups be organized throughout the province by the end of June this year (unified arrangements have been made based on the conditions of each special zone). The policy for completing the above task is to eliminate blank spots without reading groups and to consolidate and improve existing reading groups. Combine the great production emulation movement of April, May, and June to carry out the "field reading" movement in mutual aid teams. Shaanxi Daily's "Reading Life" column and the irregularly published "Communications and Reading" will publish a large number of articles on reading group activities, and it is planned to send cadres to form reading work inspection teams to inspect and promote reading work in various counties. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Shaanxi Daily plan to hold an evaluation conference for model reading groups and outstanding cultural and educational workers in mid-June.

    中共陕西省委及陕西日报号召
    六月底前发展六万个读报组
    中共陕西省委宣传部、陕西日报社，最近向全省各地委、县委发出在四、五、六三个月内，开展读报组工作的号召。号召指出：去年七月省委提出在全省建立四万个读报组的计划，到年底即已完成，并超过此数。为进一步推动群众的读报学习，省委要求在今年六月底以前，争取在全省组织读报组六万个
    （根据各专区情况已作了统一的布置）。完成上述任务的方针是消灭没有读报组的空白点，对现有读报组加以巩固和提高。结合四、五、六月的大生产竞赛运动，开展互助组中的“地头读报”运动。陕西日报的“读报生活”栏和不定期出刊的“通讯和读报”上将大量发表有关读报组活动的稿件，并准备抽调干部组成读报工作检查组，到各县检查和推动读报工作。中共陕西省委及陕西日报计划在六月中旬进行一次模范读报组及优秀文教工作人员的评选大会。    张文广
