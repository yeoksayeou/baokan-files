    Consulting the Masses is the Trick to Doing Good Work
    — An Interview with Pu Feiyun, Labor Model of Chuandong Tianfu Coal Mine
    Labor model Pu Feiyun is a coal miner from the Chuandong Tianfu Coal Mine, and now serves as the Vice Chairman of the Trade Union of this coal mine and Chairman of the Trade Union of the Second Mine. The miner brothers of the mine affectionately call him "Elder Brother Pu." This title alone demonstrates his close connection with the worker masses. Pu Feiyun worked as a cowherd for landlords from a young age. At the age of fourteen, the Red Army liberated his hometown. He joined the then-Soviet Model Team, and after three months of study, officially joined the 267th Regiment of the Red Army, following the army in battles across various regions. During the battle against Ma Bufang's White bandit troops at Mijia Ying in Gaotai, Gansu, Pu Feiyun was wounded and captured. Later, he secretly escaped home and began his life as a coal miner. Because of his life experiences, coupled with the Party's cultivation and education after liberation, he understood even better that the Party's victory and development are mainly due to the Party taking root among the masses. He often says: "In work, we must always remember this: 'Consult with the masses when something comes up.' Don't be afraid of great difficulties in work. As long as we listen to the Party's instructions and discuss with the masses, there will definitely be a solution."
    How does he connect with the masses to do good work? In his own words: "To connect well with the masses, first of all, one must maintain a humble attitude of learning from the masses, and listen to their opinions as much as possible; and one must truly believe that the masses have solutions." He said: "Once, the administrative side blindly abandoned a section of the coal seam, believing that this section of coal could not be mined and was dangerous. But I was never willing to give up, and I always thought we should think of a solution. I consulted with the older workers, and together with them, I went deep into the coal pit to investigate. Then, I convened a meeting of the group leaders of this work face to discuss and study. Everyone believed that the 'roof' and 'floor' were both good, and that if everyone raised their vigilance, safe mining could be guaranteed. As a result, a section of the coal seam that was originally considered unminable yielded 1,500 tons of coal, and saved 240 props."
    He is diligent in using his brain, and often consults and discusses with the worker brothers, solving many difficulties in his work. He often talks about the issue of changing the headings in this way. The original headings had the wrong wind direction, with the wind blowing against the workers, causing them to breathe in coal dust. Pu Feiyun listened to the suggestions of the worker brothers, discussed with them, and also overcame the conservative thinking of the administrative leaders, changing the practice of opening a heading every 20 meters in the past to opening a heading every 40 to 50 meters. This reversed the wind direction, with the wind blowing from behind the workers, so they no longer breathed in coal dust; at the same time, it saved more than half of the labor and materials. From these things, Pu Feiyun found the trick to doing good work. He said: "I will never forget 'consulting with the masses when something comes up' in my mind."

    有事和群众商量是做好工作的窍门
    ——访问川东天府煤矿劳动模范蒲飞云
    劳动模范蒲飞云是川东天府煤矿的采煤工人，现在是这个煤矿的工会副主席兼二井工会主席。矿井的工人弟兄都爱戴地叫他“蒲老大哥”。这个称号就可以说明他和工人群众有密切的联系。蒲飞云从小就在地主家当放牛娃。十四岁时，红军解放了他的家乡。他参加了当时的苏维埃模范队，经过三个月学习，正式参加了红军的二六七团，随军转战各地。在甘肃高台的米家营对马步芳白匪军作战时，蒲飞云负伤被俘。之后，他偷偷逃跑回家，开始了采煤工的生活。因为他是这样生活过来的，加上解放后党的培养和教育，他更懂得了：党的胜利和发展，主要是由于党在群众中生了根。他经常说：“工作中要常常记住这一条，‘有事和群众商量’。不怕工作有天大的困难，只要听党的指示，和群众商量讨论，就一定会有办法。”
    他是怎样联系群众做好工作的呢？用他自己的话是：“要联系好群众，首先自己要抱着虚心向群众学习的态度，多多听取群众的意见；而且要真正相信：群众是有办法的。”他说：“有一次，行政方面盲目放弃一段煤层，认为这一段煤不能开采，有危险。可是我总不死心，总想着应该再想想办法。我找了老年工人商量，和老年工人一齐深入煤坑调查，又召集这个工作面的小组长开会讨论研究，大家都认为‘天板’‘地板’都很好，大家再提高警惕性，保证可以安全开采。结果，一段原来被认为不能开采的煤层，又挖出了一千五百吨煤炭，并且节约了二百四十根支柱。”
    他就是这样勤动脑筋，经常和工人弟兄商量讨论，解决了工作中的不少困难。他常常谈到的改顺槽的问题也是这样。原来的顺槽风向不对，风迎着工人吹，工人得吃煤灰。蒲飞云听取了工人弟兄的建议，和工人弟兄一块商量讨论，又打通行政领导干部的保守思想，把过去二十公尺开一个顺槽改为四十公尺到五十公尺开一个顺槽。这样，就掉转了风的方向，风从工人背后吹来，工人就不再吃煤灰了；同时还节约了一倍以上的人工和材料。从这些事情里，蒲飞云找到了做好工作的窍门。他说：“我脑子里啥时候也不会忘掉‘有事和群众商量’。”
