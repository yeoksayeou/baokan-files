Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 15th: The London "Daily Worker" reported on May 13th under the banner headline "America Admits Forced Screening of Prisoners" that the United States confessed that prisoners of war in its Koje Island POW camp had been killed, wounded, and forcibly screened.

The "Daily Worker's" editorial said: "This not only exposes how inhuman the United States is, but more importantly, it completely exposes the whole trick of the United States' so-called 'unwillingness' of prisoners to return home—the basis of the ultimatum that the United States handed over to the Korean-Chinese side in Panmunjom last week."

The editorial continued: "Those reasons for issuing the ultimatum, which have been pointed out in the past as violating the rules of war, are now proven to be a mixture of forgery and intimidation. If we still allow our government to support such an ultimatum from the United States, we are committing a crime against peace and against our prisoners of war."

TASS, New York, May 12th: According to a report by "New York Times" reporter Haimildon, representatives of some United Nations countries expressed dissatisfaction with the delay of the Korean armistice negotiations due to the US attitude on the issue of exchanging prisoners of war. These representatives pointed out that the US demands for prior "screening" of all captured personnel and so-called "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war contradict the 1949 Geneva Convention. According to the convention, prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the cessation of military operations. Haimildon pointed out: With the exception of the United Kingdom, "the representatives of other United Nations member states that sent troops to Korea have no enthusiasm for the attitude adopted by the United States."

"Compass Daily" wrote on the negotiation issue: "The behavior of the US delegation on the prisoner of war issue is deceptive, and this behavior can only increase the risk of prolonging the Korean War."

    伦敦“工人日报”发表社论
    斥美方强迫甄别战俘的罪行
    反对英政府支持美方的无理要求
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】伦敦“工人日报”于十三日在“美国承认强迫甄别俘虏”的通栏标题下，报道了美国供认在其巨济岛战俘营内的战俘曾被杀死、击伤和被强迫甄别。
    “工人日报”的社论说：“这不仅揭露了美国是多么惨无人道，更重要的是，这件事已把美国所谓俘虏‘不愿’回国的全套把戏——美国上星期在板门店交给朝中方面的最后通牒的依据——也揭露无余了。”
    社论又说：“那些作为提出最后通牒的理由，过去已被指出是违反了战争规则的，现在又被证明为伪造和恫吓的混合物了。如果我们仍然允许我们的政府支持美国这样一种最后通牒，我们就是犯了一种反对和平、反对我们的战俘的罪。”
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：据
    “纽约时报”记者海米尔登报道：联合国一些国家的代表对于朝鲜停战谈判因为美国在交换战俘问题上所持的态度而被拖延一事，表示不满。这些代表指出，美国关于事先“甄别”一切被俘人员与所谓
    “自愿遣返”战俘的要求，是与一九四九年日内瓦公约相矛盾的。根据该公约，战俘应在停止军事行动以后立即予以释放和遣返。海米尔登指出：除英国以外，“出兵朝鲜的其他联合国会员国的代表对美国所采取的态度都没有任何热情”。
    “指南针日报”就谈判问题写道：“美国代表团在战俘问题上所表现的行为是要欺骗人，这种行为只能增加延长朝鲜战争的危险。”
