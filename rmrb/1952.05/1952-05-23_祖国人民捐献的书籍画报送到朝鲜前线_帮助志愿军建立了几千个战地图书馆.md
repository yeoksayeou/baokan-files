Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 22nd: Since a large number of books and pictorials donated by the people of the motherland were sent to the Korean front, the battlefield cultural life of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has become more active. Since March of last year, the people of the motherland have donated millions of books and magazines to the Volunteer Army and dispatched "Battlefield Cultural Service Teams" to aid Korea to the front lines to cooperate with cultural and educational workers in the Volunteer Army to establish battlefield libraries, providing cultural nourishment for Volunteer Army commanders and fighters. In the past year or so, thousands of libraries have been established in the front lines and rear troops in Korea. These libraries have taken various forms to adapt to the different environments in which the troops are stationed. For example, there are fixed libraries in the rear troops; mobile book boxes are set up in mobile troops; even in the front-line troops, soldiers carry books separately, exchange them for reading regularly, and form a kind of invisible library. The staff of the Battlefield Cultural Service Team also often take books and letters of sympathy, take advantage of rides to travel around, and distribute books to the air defense sentries along the transportation lines.

An opening ceremony was held for the library of a Volunteer Army company on the Eastern Front. The library was set up in a huge shelter, and new books, newspapers, and pictorials were displayed on wooden bookshelves made by the soldiers themselves. Many slogans were posted on the walls: "Advance Further with Every Battle," "Study While Fighting," "Ensure the Realization of the Wishes of the People of the Motherland in Donating Books, and Never Give Up Any Opportunity to Study." At the opening ceremony, the soldiers stood up and spoke one after another. They expressed their gratitude to the people of the motherland for their deep concern for the soldiers on the front lines, and they also expressed that they would fight more bravely and study harder to respond to the people of the motherland.

The establishment of various battlefield libraries has greatly encouraged the soldiers' enthusiasm for learning. In a certain unit, more than 10,460 people borrowed books in just two months after the opening of the battlefield library.

Some units also organized regular reading discussion meetings. In units with lower cultural levels, soldiers used the method of one person reading aloud for everyone to listen to. The soldiers of a certain company regarded the library as the center of their cultural learning activities. Learning wall newspapers were posted on the walls of the library, with question and answer columns, opinion columns, learning achievement promotion and demotion platforms, and challenge letters and response letters initiating learning competitions. The soldiers also held many study meetings, seminars, and entertainment meetings in the library. Among the new newspapers and books donated by the people of the motherland, People's Pictorial, Liberation Army Pictorial, and pictorials and comic strips such as Liu Hulan and Five Warriors of Langya Mountain were the most popular among the soldiers of the company. These books and newspapers have been turned over and over by the soldiers, but they are still passed from this position to that position, and if one hasn't finished reading, another comes to urge them. These books and newspapers made the soldiers love their motherland even more and greatly inspired their revolutionary heroism. The soldiers expressed their determination to eliminate more enemies to repay the love of the people of the motherland.

    祖国人民捐献的书籍画报送到朝鲜前线
    帮助志愿军建立了几千个战地图书馆
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】祖国人民捐献的大批书籍画报送到朝鲜前线后，志愿军部队的战地文化生活更现活跃。自去年三月起，祖国人民曾为志愿军捐献了几百万册图书杂志，并派遣了志愿援朝的“战地文化服务队”到前线，协同志愿军中的文教工作者建立战地图书馆，供应志愿军指挥员战斗员们的文化食粮。一年多以来，在朝鲜前线和后方部队中建立的图书馆已有数千个。这些图书馆采取了各种形式来适应各部队所处的不同环境。例如，在后方部队中有固定的图书馆；在移动的部队中设有流动的图书箱；即使在第一线部队中，战士们也把图书分散携带，定期交换阅读，成为一种无形图书馆。战地文化服务队的工作人员也常常带着图书和慰问信，乘着便车来往奔走，将图书分送给运输线沿线的防空哨兵们阅读。
    东部战线一个志愿军连队的图书馆曾举行开馆典礼。图书馆设在一个巨大的掩蔽部内，新的书籍、报纸和画报等都陈列在战士们自制的木质书架上。墙壁上贴着许多标语：“打一仗进一步”“一面战斗一面学习”“保证实现祖国人民捐献图书的愿望，决不放弃任何学习机会”。在开馆典礼上，战士们一个接一个地站起来讲话。他们对祖国人民对于前线战士们的深切关怀表示万分感激，他们还表示要更加勇敢战斗和努力学习，来回答祖国人民。
    各种战地图书馆的建立大大地鼓舞了战士们的学习热情。某部战地图书馆开馆后仅两个月，就有一万零四百六十多人借阅了图书。
    有的单位还组织了定期的读书漫谈会。在文化水平较低的单位里，战士们用一人念大家听的办法来进行学习。某连的战士们把图书馆当成了他们文化学习活动的中心。图书馆的墙壁上贴着学习墙报，墙报设有问答栏、意见栏、学习成绩升降台和发起学习竞赛的挑战书和应战书等。战士们把许多学习会、座谈会、文娱会也都放到图书馆里来举行。在祖国人民捐献的新书报中，人民画报、解放军画报和刘胡兰、狼牙山五壮士等画报和连环图画最受连队战士们的欢迎，这些书报已经被战士们翻阅烂了，但还是从这个阵地传到那个阵地，这个未读完那个又来催了。这些书报使战士们更加热爱祖国并大大鼓舞了他们的革命英雄主义精神，战士们表示要决心更多地消灭敌人，来报答祖国人民的热爱。
