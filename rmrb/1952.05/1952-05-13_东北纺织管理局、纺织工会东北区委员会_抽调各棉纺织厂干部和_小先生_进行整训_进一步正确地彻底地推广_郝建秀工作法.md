The Northeast Textile Administration Bureau and the Textile Workers' Union Northeast Regional Committee, in order to correctly and thoroughly promote the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and resolve problems in its promotion, have drawn cadres and "little teachers" from various factories for rectification and training.

In the cotton textile factories under the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau, after half a year of efforts by cadres and workers, the promotion of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" has achieved certain results. Currently, among all spinning workers, 17.28 percent are familiar with the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," 55.94 percent can generally apply it, and 26.78 percent are relatively poor in learning it. The roller lapping rate in each factory has also decreased from 2.28 percent before promotion to 1.426 percent. However, after a recent in-depth inspection, it was found that there are still many problems to be solved urgently in the promotion in various factories. The promotion work in some factories still has relatively serious formalism; some workers are called "Hao Jianxiu workers," but in reality, they do not implement the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." Because the basic spirit and characteristics of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" are not well grasped in the promotion, the operating movements of spinning workers in various factories are still very inconsistent. Although some workers' individual movements are relatively good, their work planning and flexibility are very poor, and they cannot distinguish the priorities of the work. Some workers even violate operating procedures. Various factories do not pay enough attention to the training and use of "little teachers." The Jiamusi Textile Factory canceled the "little teachers" on the pretext of insufficient manpower in production until recently, when they were restored. The "little teachers" of the Jinzhou Textile Factory have been unable to push forward the work for several months, and they have many opinions on the leading cadres, but no one cares. Since the leading cadres of some factories have inconsistent understandings of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," the methods of promotion are not uniform in various factories. The three spinning workshops of the Jinzhou Textile Factory have three different promotion methods. In addition, the measurement and scoring methods in various factories are also very chaotic, and it is difficult to see the actual situation from the statistics.

In order to solve the above problems quickly, the Northeast Textile Administration Bureau and the Textile Workers' Union Northeast Regional Committee held a "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" rectification and training class from April 15th to 26th. A total of 36 cadres and "little teachers" responsible for promotion work in various factories participated. The main purpose was to enable these cadres and "little teachers" to correctly grasp the basic spirit and characteristics of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." The rectification and training class used a forum to report the situation of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" promotion in various factories, the difficulties encountered during the promotion, and summarized the methods of promotion. The actions of the "little teachers" in various factories were unified by having the "little teachers" perform on the machine, measure, discuss, and lecture.

During the rectification and training, the cadres and "little teachers" studied very seriously. After many "little teachers" found that they had shortcomings in their operations, they automatically corrected them. The "little teachers" from the Jiamusi and Yingkou Textile Factories also exchanged opinions and studied together in their spare time. After the rectification and training, everyone further grasped the spirit and characteristics of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and learned many promotion methods, which will surely play a significant role in promoting the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" correctly in the future.

During the rectification and training period, technicians and cadres worked together to formulate a unified measurement form, scoring method, lecture outline, and drafted a preliminary reward system. (Jiang Bozhi)

    东北纺织管理局、纺织工会东北区委员会
    抽调各棉纺织厂干部和“小先生”进行整训
    进一步正确地彻底地推广“郝建秀工作法”
    东北纺织管理局、纺织工会东北区委员会，为了正确地彻底地推广“郝建秀工作法”解决推广中的问题，抽调各厂干部和“小先生”进行整训。
    在东北纺织管理局所属各棉纺织厂，经过干部、职工半年来的努力，“郝建秀工作法”推广工作，已有一定的成果。目前，在全部细纱工人中，熟悉“郝建秀工作法”的占百分之十七点二八，一般能运用的占百分之五十五点九四，学习较差的占百分之二十六点七八。各厂的皮辊花率也由推广前的百分之二点二八，降低到百分之一点四二六。但是，经过最近深入检查，发现各厂在推广中还有很多问题急待解决。有些厂的推广工作还有比较严重的形式主义；有些职工虽被称为“郝建秀工作者”，但实际上并没有执行“郝建秀工作法”。由于在推广中对于“郝建秀工作法”的基本精神和特点掌握得不够，各厂细纱工人的操作动作，至今仍很不统一。有些工人的个别动作虽然比较好，但工作的计划性、机动性很差，分不清工作的轻重缓急。个别职工甚至违反操作规程。对于“小先生”的培养和使用，各厂也不够注意。佳木斯纺织厂藉口生产上人手不够用，把“小先生”取消了，直到近来才恢复起来。锦州纺织厂的“小先生”，好几个月来都推不动工作，对领导干部意见很多，但也没有人管。由于有些厂的领导干部对“郝建秀工作法”认识不一致，各厂在推广的方式、方法上也不统一。金州纺织厂三个细纱车间，就有三种不同的推广方法。此外，各厂在测定、记分方法上，也很混乱，从统计出来的数字很难看出实际情况来。
    为了使以上问题能迅速得到解决，东北纺织管理局、纺织工会东北区委员会，在四月十五日到二十六日，举办了一期“郝建秀工作法”整训班。各厂负责推广工作的干部和“小先生”共三十六人参加。主要目的是使这些干部和“小先生”，能正确地掌握“郝建秀工作法”的基本精神和特点。整训班利用座谈会方式，汇报了各厂推广“郝建秀工作法”的情况和推广中的困难，并总结了推广的方式、方法。以“小先生”上机台表演、测定和讨论、讲课的办法，统一了各厂“小先生”的动作。
    在整训中，干部和“小先生”都很认真学习。许多“小先生”发现自己操作上有缺点以后，都自动改正过来。佳木斯、营口纺织厂“小先生”，在课余时间还互相提意见共同研究。经过整训，大家都进一步掌握了“郝建秀工作法”的精神和特点，并学会了很多推广的方法，对今后正确推广“郝建秀工作法”一定能起很大的推动作用。
    在整训期间，技术人员和干部们共同努力，制订出了统一的测定表格、评分办法、讲课提纲，并拟出了初步的奖励制度。 （蒋博智）
