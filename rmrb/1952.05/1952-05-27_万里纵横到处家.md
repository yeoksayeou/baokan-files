　　Home Everywhere Across Thousands of Miles

　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Hua Shan

　　It was quite a coincidence. I was just thinking of going to the Baishan Motor Regiment when the regiment commander arrived, and he was about to return after dinner.

　　"Come with me," he said warmly, waving his arm with a crippled wrist. "Two hundred and twenty-two li, three hours to arrive. My little jeep can't be hit by enemy planes. The driver is brave and nimble. He's been driving in Korea for a year without a single minor accident. I guarantee your safety."

　　The enthusiastic invitation was full of confidence and boasting, leaving you no room for hesitation, just like joining an old unit on the battlefield. We set off before sunset.

　　In the December weather, the jeep sped along the cold highway. The traffic increased. Big trucks overtook us one after another, disappearing into the twilight.

　　"Those are all vehicles from our regiment," Regiment Commander Yu said. "They all set out before dark, wanting to grab as much road as possible. Look at them go! Even faster than a jeep."

　　I looked at the speedometer: the luminous needle pointed to forty kilometers per hour. Another one overtook us, leaving a cloud of dust.

　　Another one. Another one. … The dust blocked the highway, and the roar of engines filled the ears.

　　"Overloading and speeding has become a tendency!" the regiment commander said, with a hint of fondness in his criticism. "Speed is our regiment's style. The air defense sentries all recognize it. When we first came to Korea, it took us ten days or so to travel a thousand li. Now we emphasize 'loading enough and driving steadily.' Each truck is only allowed to load twenty large barrels, and the squad leader's truck leads the way to keep everyone in check. Otherwise, the vehicles in the rear would fly away."

　　Several whistles sounded in the wind, disappearing into the ear along with the drawn-out command: "Air raid! Air raid!" Only then did I realize that it was completely dark, and I didn't even notice the old sheepskin coat of the air defense sentry flashing by.

　　The jeep continued to speed along. I watched the roadside. The old sheepskin coat flashed before my eyes again. It turned out that the air defense sentries along the way were all leaning toward the cars, delivering the commands in an instant. The sound was so mixed, deep, and far-reaching, and the driver was so quiet and calm, that both sides were obviously used to air raids and completely ignored the flashing lights in the sky.

　　Enemy planes were strafing. Red, gold, floating, spraying… The jeep happened to turn on its lights at this moment. A wave of tension rose in my heart, but everything went dark again. The car jolted and swayed violently, constantly tilting and rising on bomb craters. In just a flash of light, the driver remembered the entire stretch of potholes and twisted, muddy road, and in the blink of an eye, he was back on the flat road.

　　The light flashed on again. I also managed to see clearly: rice paddies filled with large bomb craters, shattered ice ridges, and a dark mass of busy figures: hoeing, carrying soil, carrying soil bags… Deep ruts passed through the bustling crowd. The car bounced in the darkness again. "This is a key blockade zone for the enemy planes," the regiment commander said quietly. After the failure of the indiscriminate bombing policy, the enemy planes recently adopted a new tactic of "key bombing." Several "B-29s" would drop hundreds of large bombs on a single point in the early morning and evening, forcibly tearing up and blowing away the surrounding ground, even lifting the roadbed. However, vehicles only needed a ten-foot-wide road surface to pass. The engineers launched a sudden attack, and the road was cleared again.

　　In the distance, similar white lights were flashing everywhere: left, right, the distant horizon, flashing and disappearing.

　　We arrived at our destination at only 7:30 PM, an indescribable joy - we can even go to bed early when traveling at night in Korea! If it were last winter, not to mention the difficulty of traveling two hundred li in one night, just finding a place to camp and camouflage the car would take two or three hours of blind groping.

　　"With air defense sentries, cars have ears and eyes," Regiment Commander Yu said. Later, I visited several companies, and the drivers all said the same thing.

　　This volunteer army motor regiment, named after Changbai Mountain, mostly came from auto factories in major cities in Northeast China: Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, Qiqihar... Especially those from Dalian, for whom driving a trip to Lushun was a major event in their lives: their families would send padded coats and jackets, and the manager would warm wine to ward off the cold. Even with the headlights on full blast at dusk, they were afraid of falling into the ditch—and even then, they never left the asphalt road. Suddenly coming to the Korean battlefield, the test of war was particularly severe.

　　The time when the frontline offensive swept across thousands of miles was also the time when the motor transport units faced the greatest difficulties.

　　At that time, as soon as they crossed the river, they would climb mountains in the dark. They couldn't tell if there were planes or not—as soon as the engine started, the driver became deaf. If there was no bombing or strafing for half the night, others would turn on their lights, and they would follow suit, not expecting that enemy planes were already circling overhead. With so many vehicles, it was necessary to disperse and run, but there were many mountains and roads in Korea, and at every fork in the road, they would be dumbfounded: there were no residents in the abandoned villages, and even if there were, they didn't understand the language. They had no choice but to wait, not familiar with the roads. After waiting for a while, the vehicles would pile up again. Seeing that dawn was approaching, they couldn't disperse and hide, so they had to hurriedly drive the cars into the mountains and gullies.

　　"As soon as we crossed the border, we became deaf and blind," a motor company commander said. "In our company, most of the drivers grew up in peaceful cities like Dalian: there were restaurants and hotels when they went out, ready-made meals and water at home, and they could find the manager if they had any difficulties. If the sky fell, the People's Government would bear it. Who would have thought that as soon as they crossed the border, they would have to fend for themselves? I led the way to catch up with the forward troops, and in just ten days, everyone's eyes were as big as walnuts."

　　At that time, it was the "Three-Nine" weather. Along the way were snow-covered mountains, rivers, and streams. The closer to the front line, the more frantic the enemy planes became. They couldn't lower the windshield, so they couldn't see the road at all, so they had to let the mountain wind beat against their faces night after night. If they couldn't breathe, they had to stare straight ahead, and they didn't dare to blink even when snow and sand hit them. But the mountain road was so narrow, the snow slope was so steep, and even with their eyes open, they often fell into the snow ditch, let alone going the wrong way. They couldn't travel a hundred li in one night, and when they looked at their watches, they became anxious: "It's almost three o'clock, hurry up and find a place to hide!" But there was a white expanse on both sides, and no one knew where the terrain was good. After finally camouflaging and hiding the car, it was already dawn, and they couldn't find a place to cook. So they had to borrow pots and ladles, chop firewood, and fetch water, and dig a snow nest in the wilderness to build a fire and cook. After struggling to make a meal of sorghum rice, they were too sleepy to sit up. But they also had to take turns guarding the car on the snowy mountain. In the afternoon, they started to get busy again, and they were busy until dark. Then they drove the car onto the highway again, working all night.

　　"At that time, we worked all night, and we never dreamed that we would be able to eat this kind of food today," the company commander said happily, with hot scallion oil sesame cakes, stir-fried daylily with pork slices, and Korean sauerkraut pickled with Chinese cabbage, and a large pot of tofu soup right beside him.

　　After the meal, we went to visit the car concealment area. We walked towards the sound of nearby engines—what a huge project! A brand-new yellow earth road wound through a narrow gully. Square black holes revealing the cars lined up along the soil cliffs on both sides, and people in military uniforms covered in oil were busy preparing for departure: fetching water, adding oil, changing tires, and starting the engine.

　　"It's good to have a lot of people!" the company commander boasted. "This big bunker was left by our volunteer army field units; those small bunkers were dug by volunteer civilian workers; the warm kang cave dwellings on the sunny slopes were dug by ourselves... Look at this project: digging up tree roots, blasting rocks, building straw walls—just the wood for building the pillars and covering the roof had to be sawed down from that distant mountain and carried here. How much labor does it take for a small cave! In less than two months, this mountain became a car fortress. Four hundred and seventy-five million—the more I think about it, the more exciting it is."

　　"Otherwise, it would be called 'the great motherland'!" the political instructor said happily. "Working people are everywhere, and no difficulty can stop two working hands: the air defense sentries just casually dug around, and the car bunkers on the highway were placed from the rear to the front line; one motor company digs a car fortress, and our home is spread all over the Korean battlefield."

　　For several days, I went from one company to another. Some required a fifty-li car ride, and others only twenty or thirty li.

　　"Is it fun to drive during the day?" I asked a driver who had just returned.

　　"It's quite dazzling," he said, squinting his eyes, a smile suddenly cracking on his tired face. "I can't drive during the day. It's better at night!"

　　"Why are you lagging behind again?" the company commander greeted him: "Everyone has eaten and gone to bed."

　　"I made an extra round trip," he said, suddenly standing at attention, obviously not boasting.

　　"You just like to take this risk! How high is the sun? You don't take the property of the motherland seriously. What if it gets shot down? Quickly hide the car!"

　　"It's hidden."

　　"Go back and eat and sleep first, and prepare for a meeting this afternoon to review."

　　It is a violation of discipline for trucks to perform transport tasks during the day. The company commander criticized, but he couldn't help but feel a little fondness. As soon as the driver left, he praised: "Three round trips in one night, a total of one thousand two hundred li. Now the drivers are becoming more and more wild. They are still running when it's light—they have figured out the enemy planes' activity patterns and will take any opportunity. We can't not strictly enforce discipline."

　　The political instructor said: "Now that the cars have a home, the driving efficiency is even higher! In the past, it would take at least one or two hours to find a place to camp and hide on the road. If the car happened to have a problem at that time, or fell into a ditch and overturned, and couldn't be rescued, a perfectly good car would be abandoned on the road. So we would stop early before dawn. Now there are car fortresses everywhere, and even if they don't belong to our regiment, they belong to brother units. We feel more confident driving on the road. The driver just now made two round trips in one night, exceeding the prescribed distance by one hundred li. He could have come back earlier to rest. But there were still three hours before dawn, and it would be more than enough to deliver another load, so he didn't go home and went straight to the station, loaded the goods, and ran to the supply station.

　　By the time he unloaded the goods at the destination, it was already six o'clock in the morning, but the sun wouldn't come out for another hour or so: 'It's better to rush back a bit, so we don't have to run so much at night.'

　　At this time, it was also getting brighter, there were fewer cars on the road, and it was a fast, empty run. The sun came out and he had already run a hundred li. The gas station was right in front of him, and it was convenient to eat, sleep, and hide the car. But at this time, the ditch was foggy, and the mountain road ahead was winding and twisting, which was good for dealing with enemy planes: 'It's better to rush another thirty or fifty li, and then find a mountain village to stay in; then leave half an hour early in the afternoon, and we'll be home before sunset.' As he got into the swing of things, he ran hard again, until the fog cleared and the sky opened up. At this time, it was less than fifty li from home: 'Twenty li ahead is an anti-aircraft artillery position. Enemy planes wouldn't dare to sneak into that area. Let's just stay there.' But when the car drove to the anti-aircraft artillery position, his hands and feet couldn't stop: 'What's wrong with running for another fifteen minutes and we'll be home? Even if enemy planes chase us for a few laps, we won't run more than twenty li? There are car bunkers all along the way, and if we can't escape, we can just dive into a hole.'…"

　　"That's how the drivers are now," the political instructor said. "They know the roads well, they know the enemy planes' habits, they know where it's good to hide, where there are gas stations, and where they can repair cars. Everyone knows everything clearly. It's really like traveling thousands of miles and settling down everywhere—from the Yalu River all the way to the 38th parallel. The car dares to go out for a month or two without carrying gasoline or food."

    万里纵横到处家
    新华社记者　华山
    真凑巧，正想到白山汽车团去，团长就来了，而且吃过饭就要回去。
    “和我一起走吧，”他热呼呼地说，挥着腕骨残废的胳膊，“二百二十二里，三个钟头到，——我这小吉普敌机是打不着的：司机勇敢、灵活，到朝鲜开一年车没出过点小事故。你的安全我保险。”
    热情的邀请充满了信心和夸耀，不由你有半点犹疑，就像在战场上跟上了老部队那样。太阳没落山我们就出发了。
    十二月天气，吉普在寒冷的公路上疾驰着。来往的汽车多起来了。大卡车一辆辆地追上来，超越过去，消失在薄暮里。
    “都是我们团的汽车，”于团长说，“天不黑就全部出动了，都想多抢一段路。你看跑的！比吉普还快。”
    我看看时速表：磷光针指着四十公里。又一辆超越过去，留下滚滚飞尘。
    又是一辆。又是一辆。……飞尘遮断了公路，马达满耳轰响着。
    “多装快跑成了偏向啦！”团长说，责备中总是有点偏爱。“快就是我们团的作风。防空哨都认出来了。刚出国的时候，一千里地摸十来天。现在提出‘装够稳跑’，一台车只准装到二十大桶，还要班长的汽车领头压住。要不后车早飞啦。”
    大风里几响哨声，和拉长的口令一起在耳边消失：“防空！防空！”这时我才发觉天完全黑了，防空哨的老羊皮大衣从旁边闪过也不觉得。
    吉普继续疾驰。我注视着路边。老羊皮大衣又在眼前一闪。原来一路上的防空哨兵都是把头凑向汽车，在顷刻间送出口令的。声音如此浑和，深远，司机如此安静，沉着，显然双方对空袭都早已习惯了，根本没理睬天空的弹光。
    那是敌机在扫射。红色的，金色的，飘着的，喷射着的，……吉普偏偏在这时亮灯了。心头一阵紧张，但眼前又漆黑起来。车子好一顿颠簸摇晃，老在炸弹坑上倾斜起伏着，——只是一刹那间的亮光，司机便记住了整段坑洼曲扭的烂泥道，转眼间便上了平坦的路面。
    灯光又一闪亮。我也来得及看清了：布满大炸弹坑的稻田，炸裂的冰棱，黑压压一片忙碌的人影：挥锄的，挑土的，扛着土袋的，……深陷的车辙穿过奔忙的人丛。汽车又在黑暗中颠簸起来。“这是敌机的重点封锁区。”团长安静地说。滥炸政策失败以后，敌机最近又来一套“重点轰炸”，几架“B二九”一早一晚，集中一点扔下几百颗大炸弹，硬把周围的地皮掏烂，炸飞，连路基也给抬跑了。可是汽车来往，只要丈把宽的一条路面。工兵一阵突击道路又通了。
    在远方，同样的白色灯光也到处闪着：左边、右边，辽远的天边，一闪又不见了。
    到目的地只七点三十分，说不出的高兴——在朝鲜走夜路也能睡早觉啦！要是去年冬天，不说一宿难跑二百里路，光是找地方宿营和伪装汽车也得瞎摸两三个钟头呢。
    “有了防空哨，汽车就有耳朵眼睛了。”于团长说。以后我访问了几个连队，司机们也都是这末说的。
    这个以长白山命名的志愿军汽车团，绝大部分都是来自东北各大城市的汽车工人：沈阳，长春，哈尔滨，齐齐哈尔，……特别是大连来的，汽车跑一趟旅顺就是生平大事了：家里给送袄送褂，经理给烫酒搪寒，黄昏开足了大灯还怕掉沟，——就这末着也没离开过一步柏油马路。猛然来到朝鲜战场，战争的考验是格外严酷的。
    前线攻势横扫千里的时候，也正是汽车部队步步困难的时候。
    那时候，一过江就摸黑爬山。也听不出到底有没有飞机，——马达一响司机就成了聋子。跑半宿不见轰炸扫射，旁人打灯自己也跟着打灯，没料想敌机早在头顶盘旋。群车目标大，得分散跑，可是朝鲜山多路多，一到岔路口上又楞住了：废圩上没有居民，就是有也不懂话；路不熟只好等着。三等两等汽车又挤成一大溜，眼瞅着马上天亮也没法分散隐蔽了，只好急忙忙地把汽车开进山林沟岔。
    “一出国就变成聋子瞎子。”一个汽车连的连长这样说。“在我们连里，主要的司机都是在大连这样的和平城市长大的：出门有饭馆客店，回家饭水现成，有困难就找经理，天塌下来还有人民政府扛着。哪里想到一过江什么都得自己当家？我领头开车追赶前方部队，只十来天每个人的眼睛都熬的核桃大了。”
    那时候正是“三九”天气。沿途都是盖满大雪的山岭河川，越靠前线敌机活动越疯狂。不放下玻璃风挡，根本看不见路，只好让山风一宿宿地迎面打着。透不过气来还得瞪直眼珠，雪砂扑打着也不敢眨一眨眼。可是山路这样窄，雪坡这样陡，瞪着眼还常常掉进雪沟，更不用说走错路了。一宿摸不出百来里地，看看表又着急起来：“快三点啦，赶紧找地方隐蔽！”可是两旁一片白茫茫的，谁也不知道那里地形好。好容易把车子伪装隐蔽起来，天也亮了，还找不到个做饭的地方。于是又得借锅借杓，打柴打水，到野地挖个雪窝架柴做饭。好歹忙出一顿高粱米饭，人也困的坐不住了。可是还得到雪山上轮流放哨看车。——下午三点多钟又开始忙碌起来，一直忙到天黑。然后又跟手把汽车开上公路，干个通宵。
    “那时候一宿盯住一宿干，做梦也想不到今天能吃上这种饭的。”连长乐着说，跟前摆着热腾腾的葱花油酥饼，黄花炒肉片，还有祖国大白菜泡制的朝鲜酸菜，跟手又来了满满一大盆的豆腐汤。
    饭后去参观汽车隐蔽部。我们朝着近处的马达声响走进去，——好大的工程，崭新的黄土路面蜿蜒在窄窄的沟岔里，两侧土崖排着露出汽车的方形黑洞，军装油污的人们正在忙着出发的准备工作：提水，添油，换车带，发动机器。
    “人多就是好办事啊！”连长夸耀着说，“这个大掩体，是咱们志愿军野战部队留下的；那些小掩体，是志愿民工队给挖的；阳坡上的暖炕地洞，是我们自己挖的。……你看这工程：刨树根，炸石头，砌草坯，——光是打桩盖顶的木料，就得从那一片远山上锯倒，扛来，一个小洞得花多少人工！前后不到两个月，这一片山岗都成了汽车堡垒了。四亿七千五百万，——真是越想越带劲。”
    “要不就叫做‘伟大的祖国’咧！”指导员也乐起来。“劳动人民遍天下，啥困难也挡不住两只干活的手：防空哨只是在跟前捎带挖挖，公路上的汽车掩体就从后方摆到前线；一个汽车连挖一座汽车堡垒，咱们的家就布满整个朝鲜战场。”
    一连好几个白天，我从一个连队转到另一个连队。有的得坐五十里汽车，有的只一二十里。
    “白天跑车过瘾吧？”我问一个刚刚回来的司机。
    “怪晃眼的，”他眯缝着眼睛说，疲劳的脸忽然裂出微笑。“白天都不会开车了。还是晚上好啊！”
    “怎么又掉队啦？”连长迎过来：“都吃过饭睡下了。”
    “多跑了个来回。”他说，忽然立正起来，显然不是夸功。
    “你就是喜欢冒这个险！太阳多高啦？拿着祖国财产不当回事，叫打掉了怎么办？快把车子隐蔽好！”
    “隐蔽好了。”
    “先回去吃饭睡觉，准备下午开会检讨。”
    大卡车在白天执行运输任务，是违反纪律的。连长责备着，总难免有点偏爱，司机一走他就赞叹起来：“一宿跑三个来回，足有一千二百里啊。现在司机越跑越野了，天亮了还跑，——都摸透了敌机的活动规律，有个空子就钻。不严格执行纪律不行。”
    指导员说：“汽车有了家，行车效率更高啦！从前在路上找宿营隐蔽地，少说也得一两个钟头，如果那时候汽车正好出个毛病，或者掉沟翻车，救不出来，就能把好好的一台汽车白白扔在路上。所以不等天亮就早早地住下了。现在到处都是汽车堡垒，不是本团的也是兄弟部队的，路上跑着心里也有底了。刚才这个司机，本来一宿跑了两个来回，已经超过规定的路程一百里，满可以早些回来休息的。可是亮天还得三个钟头，再送一趟货也绰绰有余，所以不回家又直奔车站，装上了货又往兵站跑。
    到目的地卸了货，已经是早晨六点钟，可是太阳露头还得个把钟头：‘不如往回再赶一段路，省得晚上多跑。’
    这时候天也亮了，路上车也少了，又是放空快跑，太阳一出早已跑了百来里地。加油站就在跟前，吃饭睡觉隐蔽车都还方便，可是这时沟里雾腾腾的，前面的山路又弯拐曲折，很好对付敌机：‘不如再赶三五十里，然后找个山庄住下；后晌再提前出车半点钟，太阳不落就到家了。’一来劲又紧跑一阵，直到雾散天开，这时离家也不到五十里了：‘前面二十里就是高射炮阵地，敌机钻空子也不敢钻到那里的，干脆到那里住下得啦。’可是汽车开到高射炮阵地跟前的时候，两手两脚再也停不下来了：‘再跑一刻钟怎的也到家啦，敌机追几圈咱还跑不出一二十里？一路上汽车掩体有的是，跑不掉再钻洞子也来得及’。……”
    “现在司机们就是这样的，”指导员说，“路也摸熟了，敌机的脾气也摸透了，什么地方好隐蔽，什么地方有油站，什么地方能修车，每个人都一清二楚，真个是行车万里，到处安家，——从鸭绿江一直顶到‘三八’线，汽车不带汽油粮食也敢出去跑他一两个月了。”
