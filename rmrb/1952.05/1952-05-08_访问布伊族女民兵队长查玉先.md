    Visiting Cha Yuxian, Female Captain of the Bouyei Militia
    Huang Lin

    I visited Cha Yuxian, a Bouyei (Zhongjia) woman and leader of a militia team, who was a member of the Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group that came to Beijing for the May Day celebrations.

    Cha Yuxian is a nineteen-year-old Bouyei woman from Pingzhai Village, Mali Township, Xingyi County, Xingren Special District, in southwestern Guizhou. In the spring of 1950, most of Guizhou had been liberated, but the Kuomintang remnants fled into the deep mountains and forests, continuing to harm the people of all ethnic groups. At this time, the townships and districts to which Pingzhai belonged had been liberated one after another, and people's governments had been established. Only villages like Pingzhai, close to the edge of the old forests, were still places where bandits entrenched and operated. Under the leadership of the district people's government and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the Bouyei people of Pingzhai organized two militia forces, using spears, firelocks, and broadswords to fight the bandits. The militia force led by Cha Yuxian had more than thirty people, including six women, herself included. The following is Cha Yuxian's account of the combat experience of this militia force.

    In May 1950, on a drizzly evening, more than 1,000 bandits came to attack Pingzhai. The thirty-plus militiamen of Pingzhai began their first battle. This time they killed a bandit, won a victory, and strengthened the militia's confidence. One dark night at the end of August, while Cha Yuxian was on sentry duty, she discovered torches in the old forest behind Pingzhai. She led seven militiamen to investigate and ran into six bandits. They captured five on the spot, obtaining six rifles and some grenades. The Pingzhai militia's confidence in suppressing bandits was even higher. Cha Yuxian said, "We've gone from fighting with homemade cannons to using rifles!"

    On another occasion, a militiaman on sentry duty captured a bandit transporting guns and ammunition. Cha Yuxian remembered that her superiors had taught them to be both brave and resourceful. So she explained the policies to the bandit and mobilized him to surrender. It worked. Through this surrenderer, they retrieved several guns, three boxes of ammunition, forty-eight grenades, and American military uniforms and blankets hidden by the bandits in a mountain cave.

    The last major battle took place on New Year's Eve of the lunar calendar in 1950. In the middle of the night, bandits climbed onto the wall of Cha Yuxian's house and started shooting. She woke up the militiamen while settling the women and children. The militiamen fought until the third crowing of the rooster and finally repelled the bandits.

    Through battle, the Pingzhai militia team grew stronger day by day. Cha Yuxian showed strength and courage in battles, while on guard, and on sentry duty. The militiamen boasted, "Cha Yuxian is truly our good captain!"

    The spring of 1951 brought happiness and joy to the Bouyei people of Pingzhai. The People's Liberation Army arrived at Longjing on the opposite side of the mountain from Pingzhai (only two or three li away from Pingzhai) and contacted this battle-hardened militia force, bringing them cordial care. From then on, the bandits dared not come to Pingzhai again. In order to more thoroughly wipe out the bandits, the Pingzhai militia began a new task—scouting out bandit activities for the army, leading the way, and cooperating in combat. At this time, the village people's government was established in Pingzhai.

    Last May, Cha Yuxian had a great piece of good news. She said, "The people care for me and elected me to participate in the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles of Guizhou Province." After the conference, she was transferred to the Xingyi County Committee and participated in the land reform work in the Eighth Village of Mali Township.

    Also in that summer, an "Resist America, Aid Korea" campaign was launched in every village in Guizhou. Cha Yuxian cried because she was not approved to go to the Korean front. Why was she so emotional? Cha Yuxian said, "We fought the bandits to the death, how can we let those American devils who supply the bandits with guns, ammunition, military uniforms, and blankets come and destroy our happy life again!" Moreover, American soldiers had been to Xingren during the Anti-Japanese War, and the people's hatred for American imperialism was profound. Cha Yuxian said angrily, "At the 'Resist America, Aid Korea' meetings, the women tearfully denounced [the Americans], who doesn't hate them!" Cha Yuxian told me, "Two young men from Pingzhai joined the Volunteer Army, and more than thirty people participated in various government jobs." According to her, in order to better support the Volunteer Army, an agricultural production increase campaign was launched in every village in Xingren, and the donation task was overfulfilled. Then she told me about the situation of Pingzhai paying public grain. When the stars were still hanging high in the sky, as soon as the village gong rang, men, women, old, and young took to the road carrying grain. Singing and laughing, those who could walk three trips a day tried to walk four. Competitions were launched between villages to see who paid quickly and whose grain was good. She said, "Because everyone knows that to protect our good life, we must use all our strength to support the Volunteer Army."

    When I asked her about her impressions of visiting Beijing, gratitude and excitement were revealed on Cha Yuxian's face. She said, "I only feel that the motherland is truly great!" She paused and said, "If it weren't for the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, I, a Bouyei woman, would never have dreamed of coming to Beijing." She expressed her deep gratitude for the hospitality and cordial care of the leaders. She naively said that she could never have imagined that the motherland was so great. Now that she has seen the great achievements of the motherland's construction in the past two years, she is truly happy beyond words. This made her deeply realize the role of the working class in building the motherland. The fact that there is true equality between nationalities also moved her very much. She said, "Going everywhere is as warm as returning home, and the minority nationalities are especially well-treated."

    Speaking of this, she painfully recalled the days of the past. She talked about her life. When Cha Yuxian was ten years old, both of her parents died, leaving behind her older sister and two younger brothers and sisters. In order to seize her family's small house and a little bit of barren land, the landlord snatched away her twelve-year-old sister and wanted to break up her family. After her sister escaped from the landlord's house, they began to support their family by chopping firewood, cutting grass, carrying coal, and doing odd jobs. She narrated the bitter days of the past, straightened her back, and her eyes flashed with the joy of the oppressed who had won victory. She earnestly expressed that she would work hard to repay Chairman Mao.

    访问布伊族女民兵队长查玉先
    黄林
    我访问了五一节来北京观礼的西南各民族参观团团员布伊族女民兵队长查玉先。
    查玉先是贵州西南部兴仁专区兴义县麻栗乡平寨的布伊（仲家）族妇女，今年十九岁。一九五○年春天，贵州大部分地区已经解放，国民党残匪逃窜到深山老林里，继续着残害各族人民的勾当。这时，平寨所属的乡、区都先后得到解放，并建立了人民政府。只有像平寨这些靠近老林边的寨子，还是土匪盘踞和活动的地方。平寨布伊族人民在区人民政府的领导和人民解放军的帮助下，组织了两支民兵武装，用长矛、火枪、大刀，和土匪进行斗争。查玉先领导的这支民兵武装，一共三十多人，其中连她有六个是妇女。以下是查玉先所谈的这支民兵武装的战斗经历。
    一九五○年五月，一个细雨的晚间，土匪约一千多人来攻打平寨。平寨的三十多个民兵开始了第一次战斗。这次他们打死一个土匪，获得了胜利，坚定了民兵的信心。八月底的一个黑夜里，当查玉先放哨的时候，她发现平寨后山的老林里有火把。她带着七个民兵赶去，正碰上六个土匪。当下抓住了五个，得了六支步枪和一些手榴弹。平寨民兵剿匪的信心更高了。查玉先说：“我们从土炮打到步枪了！”
    另一次，放哨的民兵抓住了一个运送枪弹的土匪。查玉先想起上级教育她们要有勇有谋。于是她向土匪讲解政策，动员他们投诚。结果成功了。她们经过这个投诚者，从山洞里取出了土匪隐藏的几枝枪、三箱子弹、四十八个手榴弹和美国军装、毯子。
    最后一次大的战斗发生在一九五○年旧历的除夕。半夜，土匪爬到查玉先家的墙上放枪。她一面叫起民兵，一面安顿着妇女和孩子们。民兵战斗到鸡叫三遍，终于击退了土匪。
    平寨的民兵队经过战斗，一天天地坚强起来了。查玉先在战斗里，在站岗、放哨时，都表现了坚强和勇敢。民兵们夸耀地说：“查玉先真是我们的好队长！”
    一九五一年的春天，给平寨布伊族人民带来了幸福和喜悦。人民解放军到了平寨对山的龙井（离平寨只两三里地），和这支久经战斗的民兵武装取得联系，带给他们以亲切的关怀。土匪从此再不敢来平寨了。为了更彻底地肃清土匪，平寨的民兵开始了新的任务——给大军侦察匪情，带路，并且配合作战。这时平寨建立了村人民政府。
    去年五月，查玉先有一件大喜事。她说：“人民抬爱我，选我参加了贵州省各族各界第一次人民代表会议。”在会议后，她被调到兴义县委会，并参加了麻栗乡第八村的土地改革工作。
    也就在这个夏天，贵州的每一个村寨，都展开了抗美援朝运动。查玉先因为自己没有被批准到朝鲜前线，哭了一场。她为什么这么激动呢？查玉先说：“我们拼死拼活地和土匪斗争，难道我们能让那些供给土匪枪弹、军装、毛毯子的美国鬼子再来破坏我们的幸福生活么！”况且抗日战争时期美国兵曾经到过兴仁，人民对美帝国主义的仇恨是深刻的。查玉先愤怒地说：“在抗美援朝会上，妇女们一把鼻涕一把泪地控诉，谁不痛恨！”查玉先告诉我：“平寨有两个青年参加了志愿军，三十多人参加了政府各项工作。”据她说，为了更好地支援志愿军，兴仁的村村寨寨都展开了农业增产运动，在捐献中超额完成了任务。接着她告诉了我平寨缴纳公粮的情况。当星星还高挂在天上的时候，村里锣声一响，男女老少就担着粮食上了路。又是唱又是笑的，每天能走三趟的都争取走四趟。村寨间展开了比赛，看谁缴得快，缴的粮食好。她说：“因为大家都知道要保卫好日子，就要用一切力量来支援志愿军。”
    当我问起她来北京参观的感想时，感激和兴奋流露在查玉先的脸上。她说：“我只觉得祖国真正伟大！”她停了一下说：“要不是毛主席、共产党的领导，我这个布伊族的女子，做梦也想不到会来到北京。”她对各首长的招待和亲切关怀表示深深的感谢。她天真地讲她从前无论如何也想像不到祖国是这样的伟大。现在看到了祖国两年多来建设的伟大成就，心里真是说不出的喜欢。这使她深深地体会到工人阶级在建设祖国中的作用。民族间真正平等的事实，也使她非常感动。她说：“走到那里都像回到家里一样的温暖，都特别优待我们少数民族。”
    说到这里，她痛苦地回忆起以前的日子。她谈了她的身世。查玉先十岁时，父母亲都死了，留下姐姐和两个弟弟、妹妹。地主为要霸占她家的小房子和一点薄地，抢走了她的十二岁的姐姐，并想拆散她的一家。她姐姐从地主家逃回来以后，她们就开始靠砍柴、割草、挑煤、打短工来养活自己的家。她叙述了过去的苦日子，伸直了腰，眼睛里闪灼着被压迫者获得胜利的喜悦。她热诚地表示要好好地工作，以报答毛主席。
