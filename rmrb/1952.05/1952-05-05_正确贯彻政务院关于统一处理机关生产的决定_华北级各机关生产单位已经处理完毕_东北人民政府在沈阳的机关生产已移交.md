Since the Central People's Government Administration Council promulgated the "Decision on Unified Handling of Organ Production" on March 12, the North China Organ Production Handling Committee was formed accordingly, with Liu Xiufeng as the Director, and Zhou Wenlong, Ping Jiesan, and Han Zheyi as Deputy Directors. By April 5, all 276 organ production units under the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, North China Military Region, North China People's Revolutionary University, and various North China-level mass organizations had been processed. The handover procedures for organ production in various provinces and cities under the jurisdiction of the North China region are also being actively carried out, and it is expected that all handovers will be completed around May 20.

In North China, there are more than 1,500 organ production units, employing approximately 100,000 people. The industries include mining, chemical industry, ironwork, machinery, electrical equipment, textile printing and dyeing, flour, food, printing, farms, and more than 50 others. The North China Organ Production Handling Committee plans to take the following measures to rectify various types of organ production: 1. Units that are too small and do not play a significant role will be canceled, and personnel, funds, and equipment will be concentrated in other enterprises; 2. Units of the same nature will be merged; 3. Those with abundant funds but poor management and low production efficiency will be transformed; 4. Some that are well-managed and have development prospects, but lack funds or technical staff, will be expanded or strengthened. The aim is to reduce the number of units, concentrate manpower and funds, to run enterprises that are more urgently needed at present and strengthen the power of the state-owned economy.

When handling these production units, the North China Organ Production Handling Committee generally adopted the principle of "local handover." Except for construction enterprises, which were handed over to the respective levels of people's governments according to the original system, other industries, regardless of their original system, were handed over to the local people's government. Various provinces and cities have organized various specialized management agencies to be responsible for receiving them in batches.

During the handover process, most agencies were able to hand over without reservation in accordance with the spirit indicated by the central government. For example, Zhenhua Company, which belongs to the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, not only had normal production, complete organization, and reliable funds at the time of handover, but also readjusted its cadres, and many departments were also equipped with deputy positions, so that organ production did not suffer any losses due to the handover. A certain army of the North China Military Region, under the careful inspection of party committees at all levels and the efforts of all cadres and workers, cleared out various materials worth 13 billion yuan and more than 2.3 million catties of grain during this period, and prepared to hand them all over. However, a few organ production units showed a lack of responsibility during the handover process. The North China Organ Production Handling Committee has ordered the leading cadres of these units to conduct strict self-criticism and earnestly implement the decision of the Government Administration Council.

Xinhua News Agency: The organ production enterprises of the Northeast People's Government in Shenyang City have been completely transferred to the Shenyang Municipal People's Government. This is the first batch of organ production transferred in the Northeast, including seventeen production units and an organization managing production – the Enterprise Company. The total capital, excluding profits turned over to the state and taxes paid, has a net value of more than 71.3 billion yuan, and the total number of employees is 4,227.

The transfer of organ production by the Northeast People's Government this time went extremely smoothly. This is mainly because the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the past six months has greatly enhanced the awareness of all staff members to cherish state property. Therefore, after the Government Administration Council's decision on unified handling of organ production was announced, they actively handled the handover preparation work and smoothly handed over everything in a timely manner. After the "Three-Anti" movement began in the winter of last year, the departments under the Northeast People's Government implemented expenditure according to the financial system and handed over "small public treasuries" and extra-system automobiles, houses, furniture, etc., which were also very favorable conditions for carrying out this handover work. Another important factor is that Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman, both paid great attention to this work. Lin Feng personally guided and deployed this handover work. Therefore, this handover work was also particularly serious and meticulous. Before the handover, the General Affairs Bureau of the Northeast People's Government conducted a thorough and responsible survey and statistics on all enterprises and formulated various detailed forms and registers, such as the property catalogs of the units under its jurisdiction, statistics of profits over the years, total output value, "balance sheets of each unit," "a list to observe the development of each unit from the net value of property," and a roster of all cadres and personnel. These greatly helped the receiving organs to quickly grasp the situation and run the state enterprises well.

### 正确贯彻政务院关于统一处理机关生产的决定  华北级各机关生产单位已经处理完毕  东北人民政府在沈阳的机关生产已移交

    正确贯彻政务院关于统一处理机关生产的决定
    华北级各机关生产单位已经处理完毕
    东北人民政府在沈阳的机关生产已移交
    自三月十二日中央人民政府政务院公布“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”以后，华北机关生产处理委员会即根据中央决定组成，由刘秀峰任主任，周文龙、平杰三、韩哲一任副主任。到四月五日为止，中共中央华北局、华北军区、华北人民革命大学及华北级各群众团体的二百七十六个机关生产单位均已处理完毕，华北区所属各省、市的机关生产，目前也正在积极办理交接手续，预计在五月二十日前后即可全部交接完毕。
    华北区机关生产，共计一千五百多个单位，从业人员约十万名。行业包括矿业、化工、铁工、机械、电工器材、纺织印染、面粉、食品、印刷、农场等五十多种。对于各种类型的机关生产，华北机关生产处理委员会准备采取以下办法进行整顿：一、规模太小而又不大起作用的准备取消，把人员、资金、设备集中到其它企业中去；二、性质相同的予以合并；三、资金虽多，但经营不善、生产效率低的加以改造；四、有些经营得很好，又有发展前途，但缺乏资金或技术员工的，则予以扩充或加强。目的在于减少单位，集中人力和资金，以举办当前更急需的企业，加强国营经济的力量。
    华北机关生产处理委员会在处理这些生产单位时，一般采取了“属地接管”的原则，除建筑企业按原来系统交各该级人民政府接管外，其他各业不论原属何系统，都交给所在地的人民政府接管。各省、市都组织了各种专管机构，负责分批接收。
    在交接过程中，绝大部分机构都能根据中央所指示的精神，无保留地交出。如中共中央华北局所属振华公司，不但在移交时生产正常、机构完整、资金确实，而且重新调整了干部，许多部门还配备了副职，使机关生产不因交接受到任何损失。华北军区某军，在各级党委认真检查及全体干部、职工的努力下，在此期间清查出各种物资折款达一百三十亿元、粮食二百三十余万斤，准备全部上交。但也有少数机关生产单位在交接过程中有不够负责任的现象，华北机关生产处理委员会已责令这些单位的领导干部进行严格检讨，并认真执行政务院的决定。（华迅）
    东北人民政府在沈阳市的机关生产事业已完整地移交给沈阳市人民政府。这是东北机关生产办理移交的第一批，其中包括十七个生产单位和一个管理生产的机构——企业公司，全部资金除去上缴利润及纳税外，净值七百十三亿多元，全部职工共四千二百二十七人。
    东北人民政府这次移交机关生产进行极为顺利。这主要是半年来的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，大大提高了全体工作人员爱护国家财产的认识，因此在政务院关于统一处理机关生产的决定公布后，即积极办理移交准备工作，及时顺利地全部移交清楚。在去年冬季“三反”运动开始后，东北人民政府所属各部门即已实行按财政制度开支，交出了“小公家务”及制度外的汽车、房屋、家具等，也是进行这次移交工作极有利的条件。另外还有一个重要因素就是东北人民政府主席高岗、副主席林枫都极为注意这一工作，林枫并亲自指导和布置了这次的移交工作。因此，这次移交工作也特别严肃细致。移交前东北人民政府机关事务管理局对所有企业进行了完善负责的调查统计工作，制订了各种详尽的表格、清册，如所属各单位财产目录、历年利润统计、生产总值、“各单位资产负债表”和“由财产净值数字上观察各单位发展情况一览表”及全体干部人员名册等，这些都大大有助于接管机关迅速掌握情况，办好国家企业。  （新华社）
