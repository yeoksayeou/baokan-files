The Changchun Railway Bureau, in order to implement the decision of the Ministry of Railways leadership, has taken specific measures to fully launch the full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement.

Under the leadership of Soviet comrades, the Changchun Railway Bureau has become the birthplace of the national railway full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement. In 1950, Wang Jikui, driver of Locomotive No. 冖丂—一一九五 of Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot, with the help of Soviet guiding driver Malikianov, first created the record of 500 kilometers per car per day. Subsequently, Qiao Yuyan, driver of Locomotive No. 1008 of Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot, created a new record of 1,113.4 kilometers per car per day in June 1951. This movement was supported by advanced workers and gradually spread widely. In the fourth quarter of 1950, there were only 686 runs of locomotives running 500 kilometers, but in the fourth quarter of 1951, this increased to 4,527 runs. In 1951, 500-kilometer locomotives accounted for 27.6 percent of the bureau's operational locomotives; in April 1952, this reached 46.5 percent. Currently, all locomotive depots under the Changchun Railway Bureau have 500-kilometer locomotives. The super-axle movement was initiated by Zheng Xikun's chartered car group of Locomotive No. 冖丂1一○五 of Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, with the assistance of Soviet expert Golimink and guiding driver Brolak. Soon, this movement spread to Siping, Changchun, Mudanjiang, Boketu and other locomotive depots, and the number of super-axle trains also increased day by day. In 1951, super-axle trains hauled 18,424 times, carrying 3.695 million tons of extra cargo. In the first quarter of 1952, super-axle trains hauled 3,156 times, carrying 691,000 tons of extra cargo, averaging 215 tons more per freight train. Full loading began in the second half of 1951. At that time, there was more freight than cars. With the permission of the Ministry of Railways, Yang Maolin creatively and skillfully loaded light and bulky goods, increasing the loading capacity of less-than-carload freight from 16 tons to 27 tons. The full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement accelerated the turnover of vehicles on the Changchun Railway, expanded the line capacity, solved the shortage of locomotives and driver personnel, and at the same time broke the old quotas, broke through conservative thinking, enabling the Changchun Railway to complete increasingly heavy transportation tasks under the original technical conditions.

The gradual development of the full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement on the Changchun Railway fully demonstrates its great political and economic significance, pointing out a new direction for the people's railway to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

However, at present, some employees on the Changchun Railway still do not fully understand this movement. Some people think that "the Changchun Railway has already done a good job, and this movement has nothing to do with us." Some people think that "full load is a matter for the business department, and super-axle and 500 kilometers are matters for the locomotive department." Some people emphasize that "the station tracks are too short" and do not compile super-long trains. Some people believe that "the signal distance is too short" and dare not let go of super-axle. Some people say that "super-axle will break the hook" and "500 kilometers will cause journal box accidents." At the same time, the full load, super-axle, and 500 kilometer movement has played a great role in promoting the continuous progress of the railway's overall work. In the past, the Changchun Railway had taken a series of measures to solve organizational and technical problems in the course of advancement. However, with the further development of the movement, many problems need to be solved.

Therefore, before formulating specific methods to fully launch this movement, the Changchun Railway Bureau conducted many studies, issued a circular to all employees to conscientiously study documents, and carried out huge ideological, organizational, and technical preparations. The leaders of the Changchun Railway Bureau repeatedly exposed and criticized the above-mentioned errors of conservative thinking that were divorced from reality, and called on organizations at all levels and employees to continue to wage a resolute struggle against these erroneous ideas. According to the instructions of the Changchun Railway Bureau, each sub-bureau established a full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement committee, organized work groups to go deep into grassroots units to carry out publicity and mobilization, and solve specific problems. Harbin, Mudanjiang and other sub-bureaus attached importance to youth work from the beginning, held meetings of youth employee representatives and youth league cadres, and called on youth to stand at the forefront of the full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement. The Changchun Regional Committee of the Railway Trade Union held a meeting of labor models and advanced workers in the Harbin area, and ran a short-term training class for trade union cadres. Responsible cadres of the Changchun Railway Bureau also went deep into inspections and conducted publicity and mobilization work. While carrying out the above-mentioned series of mass work, organizational and technical preparations were also carried out. In addition to the specific discussions and studies and plans by the various business departments, the strong assistance of Soviet experts was obtained, and specific methods for the present were formulated.

Organizationally, with the deepening of the movement, closer joint labor between railway departments is required, especially joint labor between traffic dispatch and locomotive dispatch, between sub-bureaus, between station master on duty and locomotive depot duty chief and vehicle depot duty director, which is of decisive significance for this movement. According to the specific situation, the Changchun Railway has drafted methods to organize them together, and will establish Communist Party branches, Communist Youth League branches and trade union organizations in these joint labor organizations.

Technically, the Changchun Railway Bureau decided to concentrate its efforts on promoting advanced working methods directly related to the full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement, such as the Sudennikov dispatching method, the non-derailment car repair method (station repair), the use of the Kovalev working method to formulate the technical operation process of super-axle trains, and organize workers to put forward rationalization proposals directly related to the movement, while solving technical equipment problems.

The Changchun Railway Bureau held a telephone conference on May 17, emphasizing that organizations at all levels should care about the lives of employees, so that they have good working conditions, and hot meals should be sent to locomotives pulling super-axle and 500 kilometers, and these crew members will be issued sanatorium certificates.

At a recent telephone conference, the Changchun Railway Bureau also announced the following specific methods:

First, in order to ensure the smooth operation of super-axle trains, the transportation sections, locomotive sections and stations of each sub-bureau should specifically designate the train numbers for super-axle and super-long train operation in the daily plan, and the departure time of each train number at the connecting station should be notified to each station along the line and the neighboring sub-bureau together with the plan.

Second, in order to ensure the safety of super-axle train operation, the chiefs of each locomotive depot should submit the list of drivers to the sub-bureau, indicating which drivers must have a guiding driver on board when pulling super-axle trains.

Third, all locomotives initially pulling super-axle trains must be inspected personally by the chief, deputy chief and duty officer of the locomotive depot.

Fourth, the chiefs and transportation section chiefs of each sub-bureau should personally supervise the compilation of overloaded trains to ensure that the number of super-axle trains is increased as much as possible.

Fifth, the transportation section chiefs of each sub-bureau should establish special dispatching statistics on the operation of super-axle trains and super-long trains to ensure that each train can pass through intermediate stations without technical operations without stopping, especially intermediate stations where the slope of the line in front is large.

Sixth, the train dispatcher should be responsible for notifying each station in the operating section of the operating conditions of the super-axle train with dispatching orders, and supervising each station's preparation work for releasing each train.

Seventh, the transportation section chiefs and locomotive section chiefs and dispatchers of each sub-bureau should record each stop outside the signal machine on the operating diagram and analyze it thoroughly. In order to correctly count the phenomenon of stopping outside the signal machine, the transportation section chiefs and locomotive section chiefs of each sub-bureau should periodically check the driver's operation report and the operating diagram.

Eighth, the chiefs and deputy chiefs of each vehicle depot should personally supervise the inspection work and the quality of non-derailment maintenance carried out by the train inspection station on super-axle trains. The transportation section chiefs of each sub-bureau should promptly notify all train inspection stations in the jurisdiction of the operation of super-axle trains.

Ninth, the chief of the locomotive department and the chief of the locomotive depot should formulate a monthly standard for the total ton-kilometers of workload for each locomotive depot and each locomotive, establish statistics on the working conditions of the locomotive during washing and inspection for the standard, and should promptly announce the completion results.

Tenth, before May 20, the locomotive section chiefs and locomotive depot chiefs of each sub-bureau should strengthen the work of locomotive section and locomotive depot leaders and engineering and technical personnel.

Eleventh, the chiefs of each sub-bureau, the transportation section chiefs and locomotive section chiefs of each sub-bureau should improve production indicators in the increasingly developed full load, super-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement, so that this movement will move towards the road of overfulfilling the plan, accelerating vehicle turnover, reducing locomotive auxiliary mileage, and reducing transportation costs.

    批判了保守思想，作了组织上技术上的准备，布置了具体措施
    中长路全面开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动
    中长铁路管理局为贯彻铁道部领导机关的决定，已采取具体措施，全面开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动。
    中长铁路管理局在苏联同志参与领导之下，已成为全国铁路满载、超轴、五百公里运动的发源地。一九五○年，昂昂溪机务段冖丂—一一九五号司机王吉奎同志在苏联指导司机马力基雅诺夫的帮助下，首创日车五百公里的纪录；接着，昂昂溪机务段一○○八号司机乔玉岩于一九五一年六月，创造了日车一千一百十三点四公里的新纪录。这个运动受到先进工人的拥护，并逐渐广泛地开展起来。一九五○年第四季度五百公里运行的机车还只有六百八十六次，在一九五一年第四季度就增加到四千五百二十七次。一九五一年五百公里机车占全局运用机车的百分之二十七点六，一九五二年四月就达到百分之四十六点五，现在中长局所有机务段都有五百公里机车。超轴运动是苏家屯机务段冖丂1一○五号郑锡坤包车组在苏联专家哥立明克和指导司机布洛拉克帮助下开始的。不久这个运动便扩展到四平、长春、牡丹江、博克图等机务段，超轴的数量也一天比一天高。一九五一年超轴牵引一万八千四百二十四次，多拉了三百六十九万五千吨货物；一九五二年第一季度超轴三千一百五十六次，多拉了六十九万一千吨货物，平均每次货物列车多拉二百十五吨。满载是从一九五一年下半年开始的，那时货多车少，在铁道部允许之下，杨茂林创造性地巧装轻浮货物，把零担车装载量由十六吨提高到二十七吨。满载、超轴、五百公里运动加速了中长路的车辆周转，扩大了线路容量，解决了机车和司机人员不足的困难，同时更打破了旧的定额，冲破了保守思想，使中长路在原有技术条件下，完成了日益繁重的运输任务。
    中长路满载、超轴、五百公里运动的逐步开展，充分表现了它的伟大政治意义和经济意义，为人民铁道开展增产节约指出了新的方向。
    然而，目前在中长路仍有部分职工对这一运动认识还不够，有人认为“中长路已经作得很好了，这个运动与我们无关”；有人认为“满载是商务部门之事，超轴和五百公里是机务部门的事”；有人强调“站线太短”，不编超长列车；有人认为“信号距离太近”，不敢放手超轴；有人说“超轴会断钩”，“五百公里会造成燃轴事故”。同时，满载、超轴、五百公里运动，在推动铁路全盘工作不断前进上起了很大作用，过去中长路曾采取了一连串措施，解决前进中的组织上和技术上的问题。但随着运动的进一步开展，又有许多问题需要解决。
    因此，中长铁路管理局在制定具体办法以全面展开这一运动之前，曾作了多次研究，通令全局员工认真学习文件，进行思想上、组织上和技术上的巨大的准备工作。中长铁路管理局领导方面曾反复地揭露和批判了上述脱离实际的保守思想的错误，并号召各级组织和职工继续向这些错误思想作坚决的斗争。各分局根据中长铁路管理局的指示，先后成立了满载、超轴、五百公里运动委员会，组织工作组深入基层单位，进行宣传鼓动，解决具体问题。哈尔滨、牡丹江等分局一开始就重视了青年工作，召开了青年职工代表会和青年团干部会议，号召青年站在满载、超轴、五百公里运动的最前列。铁路工会中长区委会召开了哈尔滨地区劳动模范和先进工作者会议，并开办了工会干部短期训练班。中长铁路管理局负责干部并分头深入检查，作宣传动员工作。在上述一系列群众工作的同时，又进行了组织上和技术上的准备，除了各业务处经过具体讨论研究与计划外，并得到苏联专家的大力帮助，订出目前的具体办法。
    在组织上，随着运动的深入开展，铁路各部门间更要紧密的联合劳动，尤其是行车调度与机务调度，分局与分局，车站值班站长与机务段值班段长和车辆段值班主任等联合劳动，对于这一运动有决定意义。中长路按照具体情况，已拟就办法把它们组织在一起，并将在这些联合劳动的组织里边，建立共产党支部、青年团支部和工会组织。
    在技术上，中长铁路管理局决定集中力量推广满载、超轴、五百公里运动有直接关系的先进工作方法，如苏德尼果夫调度法、不甩车修车法（站修），运用郭瓦廖夫工作方法制定超轴列车技术作业过程，组织工人提出对运动直接有关的合理化建议，同时，将解决技术设备上的问题。
    中长铁路管理局于五月十七日召开电话会议，着重指出：各级组织要关心职工生活，使他们有良好的劳动条件，要把热饭送到拉超轴、五百公里的机车上去，并将发给这些乘务员以休养证。
    在最近一次电话会议上，中长铁路管理局又公布了以下的具体办法：
    第一，为保证超轴列车顺利运行，各分局车务科、机务科和各站应将日计划中专门指定超轴和超长列车运行车次，各列车车次接续站倒发时刻随同计划通知沿线各站和邻分局。
    第二，为了保证超轴列车行车安全，各机务段长应当把司机名单呈报分局，注明那些司机牵引超轴列车必须指导司机添乘。
    第三，所有初步牵引超轴列车的机车，必须经过机务段长、副段长和机务段值班员亲自检查。
    第四，各分局长、车务科长应亲自监督超重列车编车情况，保证尽量增加超轴列车次数。
    第五，各分局车务科长，对超轴列车和超长列车的运行情况应该建立专门的调度统计，保证各该列车能够不停车通过没有技术作业的中间站，尤其是前方区间线路坡度较大的中间站。
    第六，应该责成列车调度长，用调度命令向运行区间各站通知超轴列车的运行情况，监督各站对放行各该列车的准备工作。
    第七，各分局车务科长、机务科长和调度人员，应该把每次机（信号机）外停车记在运行图上，并加以切实分析。为了正确的统计机外停车的现象，分局车务科长，和机务科长应该定期把司机运转报告和运行图加以核对。
    第八，各车辆段长和副段长应亲自监督列车检查所，对超轴列车进行的检查工作和不甩车检修的质量，各分局车务科长，应及时把超轴列车运行情况，通知管内所有列车检查所。
    第九，机务处长和机务段长应该为每个机务段和每台机车制定月份总吨公里工作量的标准，建立该项标准的机车在洗检期间工作情况的统计，应该及时公布完成结果。
    第十，各分局机务科、机务段长，在五月二十日以前应加强机务科和机务段的领导人员和工程技术人员添乘工作。
    第十一，各分局长，各分局车务科长和机务科长，应该在日益发展的满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，改善生产指标，使这个运动，向超额完成计划、加速车辆周转、减低机车补助走行率、减低运输成本的道路上前进。　（新华社）
