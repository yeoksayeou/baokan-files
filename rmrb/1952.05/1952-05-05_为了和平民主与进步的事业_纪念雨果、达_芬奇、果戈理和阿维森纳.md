    For the Cause of Peace, Democracy, and Progress
    —Commemorating Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna
    Guo Moruo
    (Continued from page one)
    Gogol's sharp satire is famous. The images of bureaucrats, landlords, and petty merchants under Gogol's pen possess rich realism and typicality. Therefore, in any era, as long as the exploitative system has not been eliminated, people cannot help but encounter "Gogol's characters." Gogol's works educate us on how to hate those who should be hated. Gogol also profoundly depicted the vulgar faces of the petty bourgeoisie, making people deeply feel how ridiculous and pathetic it is to live solely for one's own personal gain. Gogol's works educate us that a person should live with a noble purpose. Gogol's satire is not cynical; people can feel great enthusiasm from his satirical works, an enthusiasm connected to the fate of the people and to the happiness and progress of his own country. Precisely because the author passionately craves perfection and progress, he can never tolerate ugliness and baseness. Thus, his satire is both fatal and powerful. While exposing the base rule of money and power, Gogol also allows people to see the noble humanity and hope for progress that cannot be suppressed by money and power.
    It is entirely correct that Russians regard Gogol as a great patriot. Such a patriot is irreconcilable with the ugly forces in his own country and serves the cause of freedom and progress for the people. Precisely because Gogol is such a patriot, his works possess world significance, and patriots of every nation can gain profound inspiration from Gogol's works.
    The people of all countries praise Gogol because he is one of the masters of the 19th-century Russian literary world. The realistic literature of this generation, with its revolutionary democratic tendencies, has made inestimable contributions to the spirit of humanity worldwide, and it is this excellent tradition that Soviet literature inherits and carries forward. As the Chinese proverb says, "When drinking water, remember the source." As we are drawing rich nourishment from the ever-flourishing Soviet literature, we must even more so praise Gogol and other Russian writers of his time.
    We also commemorate Avicenna, the great philosopher, scientist, and physician, who was born a thousand years ago according to the Islamic calendar.
    Avicenna was a Muslim who lived during the most brilliant era of Arab culture in the 10th and 11th centuries AD. His works were written in Arabic, the common language of intellectuals in the Islamic world at the time. In terms of Avicenna's contributions to philosophy and science, he deserves to be commemorated by people all over the world.
    Avicenna's achievements are most brilliantly manifested in medicine. He rejected religious superstitions and conducted purely scientific research on human physiology and pathology. He opposed the alchemy and astrology prevalent at the time. His monumental work, "The Canon of Medicine," discusses physiology, pathology, hygiene, treatment methods, and pharmacology. After his death, this work spread beyond Islamic countries, and many universities in Western Europe adopted his book as the basic teaching material for medical education until the end of the 17th century.
    It is not without reason that people call Avicenna "the Second Aristotle." Like Aristotle, he wrote encyclopedic works. He was indeed one of the most learned people in the world during the Middle Ages. He was not only a knowledgeable scholar but also a person with bold and original philosophical ideas. Transcendentalism combined with religious concepts was the "orthodox" thought of his time. He disregarded this "orthodox" thought and argued that the material world was not created by God and that all knowledge should be obtained from practical experience. Based on this materialist thought, he insisted on the spirit of empirical scientific research. Therefore, he achieved certain accomplishments not only in medicine but also in geology, astronomy, chemistry, physics, and psychology.
    Avicenna's scientific research work was not carried out calmly and steadily. Like all those who fought for the truth, he had to live a life of repeated turmoil. His medical efficacy made him admired by several kings, and he was once appointed as a minister, but the court politics of autocratic monarchs were not a suitable greenhouse for scientists. Avicenna suffered political setbacks and was even imprisoned. The conscience of a scientist supported him, enabling him to work diligently in any environment, exploring the secrets of nature and the path to conquering nature for mankind.
    Avicenna was a master nurtured by the brilliant Arab culture of the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages, most Europeans were in a "dark age" in terms of science and culture. The culture of the Tang Dynasty in China and Arab culture were the peaks of human culture at that time. Arab culture inherited the cultural achievements of ancient Greece, and the development of modern European culture owes much to Arab culture. The total achievement of human culture is accumulated by the diligent efforts of every nation and every generation in the East and the West. When commemorating Avicenna, one feels this point particularly deeply.
    We commemorate Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna for these reasons.
    Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna were all pioneers in culture and thought in their respective times and in their own nations. They promoted the cultural characteristics of their own nations through hard work, their work promoted mutual understanding between nations and enriched the total achievements of human culture. Their achievements should be counted into the general treasury of world human culture.
    The Chinese people, with an excellent tradition of four thousand years of culture, dare to accept foreign cultures with progressive significance and are also good at distinguishing between good and bad in what is transmitted from foreign countries. Fifty years ago, someone had already translated Hugo's masterpiece "Les Misérables" into classical Chinese, and Lu Xun began to introduce Gogol's name to the Chinese people fifty years ago. Until the May Fourth Movement, the spirit of "re-evaluating everything" in the Renaissance greatly inspired our ideological struggle against feudalism.
    After the October Revolution of 1917, advanced elements in China began to accept Marxist-Leninist ideas, and since then, the Chinese people have been paying attention to the vigorously developing Soviet culture with increasing interest. The Chinese people know that the cultural thought of the proletariat and Soviet culture are the most progressive cultures in human history and are the product of summarizing all progressive cultures in human history. It is entirely reasonable for the Chinese people to be enthusiastic about learning socialist cultural thought and all socialist cultural products. But at the same time, we must still absorb all progressive cultures in foreign history to enrich ourselves. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "China should absorb foreign progressive culture on a large scale as raw material for its own cultural nourishment. This work has not been done well enough in the past. This includes not only current socialist culture and new-democratic culture but also foreign ancient cultures, such as the culture of the Enlightenment era in various capitalist countries. Everything that we can use today should be absorbed." ("On New Democracy")
    We have always strictly distinguished between the various corrupt things of the decadent period of the Western bourgeoisie and the upward and healthy culture of the Enlightenment era in capitalist countries. In the past three or four decades, imperialists, especially American imperialists, have consciously instilled their decadent culture into China. Contained in the products of these imperialists, who insulted the dignity of human culture, are extreme selfish egoism, a perverted psychology of despair and madness, anti-rational mysticism, murder, pornography, national chauvinism, the destruction of moral and justice concepts, and the trampling of human aesthetics. All these dark things must be rejected and excluded by us.
    In the past, with the support of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there was a cultural restorationist who used the name of inheriting ancient Chinese culture to exclude all foreign progressive things. But they did not inherit the essence of ancient Chinese culture; they attempted to revive the decadent things of the feudal ruling class. And when they rejected progressive culture from abroad, they welcomed Hollywood pornographic movies, jazz music, and fascist ideas. The decadent culture of Western imperialism and Chinese feudal restorationism formed an alliance in an attempt to stifle the cultural progress of the Chinese people.
    The culture of the Chinese people can truly inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of ancient Chinese culture and can also truly absorb the essence of foreign culture. In the long history of our own nation, there is a large amount of popular cultural heritage, of which we are proud. We also sincerely appreciate and praise all the excellent cultural achievements of foreign nations.
    When commemorating Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna, we see that on the one hand, they each have different personalities and different achievements; on the other hand, they also have certain things in common. These common things can also be found in the outstanding cultural creators of every nation and every era. What are the common things they possess? I think the main ones are the following.
    First, they all use great efforts to explore and pursue objective truth. Although their fields of work are different, they are consistent in this point: they are unwilling to stop in front of the "secrets" of natural and social phenomena, and they do not believe that these "secrets" are impossible to know but that they can be known. They strive to use their scientific research and artistic power to open the "secrets" in front of mankind. Due to the efforts of generations of people, mankind has finally gradually been able to break away from being dominated by natural laws and social laws and gradually acquired the ability to dominate natural laws and social laws. Therefore, we must pay tribute to all the warriors who pursue the truth in history.
    Second, they all deeply care about the suffering of the vast majority of people. They care about the material pain of the people and also care about the spiritual pain of the people. The situation in which people are forced to live a life without political rights and are forced to lose any ideals in life is intolerable to all pioneers of human progress. They use different methods to expose and oppose the system of exploitation and oppression that causes the suffering of the people. They love their own nation, and they strive to eliminate the roots that harm the cultural life of the people and the nation. They love their own country, and they dare to fight against the scum and rotten phenomena in their own country.
    Third, they all hold strong hope for the rational future of mankind. Although the times in which they lived caused them pain, and their own lives also contained pain, they did not say that the future of mankind is hopeless and is going to destruction. On the contrary, they used their own work to make people believe that the light of hope is forever in front of mankind, illuminating mankind's progress. Although their own understanding of the future of mankind is often only vague, they have always fulfilled such a responsibility in their own times: passing the inextinguishable torch of hope to future generations. They infected the people of their time, and also infected later generations, with the victorious confidence in fighting for truth and freedom and for a beautiful world in which all nations live together in peace.
    The pursuit of objective truth, concern for the suffering of the people, hope and confidence in the rational future of mankind, aren't these precisely the most moving commonalities manifested in all cultural pioneers when we unfold the history of human cultural progress? These cultural pioneers are concerned not only with the freedom and progress of their own nation but also with the harmonious and rational common life between nations; because only in this situation can human happiness and the unlimited development of cultural life have the greatest guarantee. The people all over the world who are fighting for the cause of peace, democracy, and progress today have inherited the great ideals of these cultural pioneers and are making it possible for these ideals to be further realized.
    But in the current world, there is a small handful of imperialists whose ideas are precisely the opposite. They use deceptive lies to replace the pursuit of truth, what they care about is how to conduct murderous wars rather than how to increase the welfare of the people, and they use dark shadows to cover the future of mankind. What they are most interested in is even: using people as experimental subjects to conduct "research" on atomic weapons and germ weapons, and using the results of this "research" to slaughter humanity on a larger scale!
    The poet Hugo once enthusiastically sang about "the future century," saying:
    "In the sky of the world striving for liberation, above the heads of all young nations, peace, spreads two wide, firm wings in the blue sky." Hugo's hope, without a doubt, is precisely the hope of progressive humanity in every era. But today's imperialists regard the noble hope of this great poet as dung, they are so eager to press the black shadow of the war demon over the heads of every nation!
    When the crazy American imperialists can only seek their way out from fleas, lice, flies, and mosquitoes, it is impossible for them to see Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, Avicenna, and all the bright names in the history of human culture in their eyes.
    We know that the Hugo statue in Hugo Square in Paris was destroyed by the fascist invaders in 1941, and on the original site of the statue, a model of the Ford Motor Company has now been installed, marking the power of the gold empire. When we hear such things, we cannot help but feel angry like the French people, because this is not only an insult to the culture of the French nation but also an insult to the culture of mankind! The American imperialists and their servants are challenging the sacred cause of human peace, democracy, and progress with such despicable behavior!
    Human culture is never afraid of this challenge. The names of Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna will be immortal, but those autocratic monarchs who enslaved them and persecuted them during their lifetimes have long been forgotten!
    The hundreds of millions of people all over the world who are fighting for peace, democracy, and progress will never allow the warmongering imperialists to insult human culture with their poisonous hands, and will never allow these criminals to develop their dark acts that destroy knowledge, destroy hope, and destroy humanity. The people of the world are fighting to defend the excellent cultural traditions of humanity represented by Hugo, da Vinci, Gogol, Avicenna, and all other great names! That is, fighting to defend peace, democracy, and progress!
    The great unity of the people of the world, which is bound to be strengthened due to the promotion of cultural exchange, guarantees that the future of mankind has infinite light.

    为了和平民主与进步的事业
    ——纪念雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理和阿维森纳
    郭沫若
    （上接第一版）
    果戈理的尖锐的讽刺是有名的。在果戈理笔下的官僚、地主以及市侩商人的形象，都具有丰富的现实性和典型性，因而在任何时代里，只要剥削制度尚未消除，人们就不能不遇到“果戈理的人物”。果戈理的作品教育我们，应该如何地去憎恨那应该憎恨的人。果戈理又深刻地写出了那种庸俗的小市民的面目，使得人们不能不深切地感到，如果一个人仅仅为自己鼻子前面的一点个人利益而活着，是多么可笑可怜。果戈理的作品教育我们，人活着应该有一个高尚的目的。果戈理的讽刺不是冷嘲，人们从他的讽刺作品里可以感受到巨大的热情，这种热情是和人民的命运相关连的，是和自己的祖国的幸福和进步相关连的。正因为作者热烈地渴求完美与进步，所以他才绝不能忍受丑恶与卑污的事物。因而他的讽刺也才是致命的和有力的。果戈理在暴露了金钱与权力的卑污的统治时，又使人看到金钱与权力所压不死的崇高的人性与进步的希望。
    俄罗斯人把果戈理看做是伟大的爱国者，这是完全正确的。这样的爱国者是和自己国家中的丑恶势力势不两立的，是服务于人民的自由进步事业的。正因为果戈理是这样的爱国者，所以他的作品也就具有世界意义，每一个民族的爱国者都能从果戈理的作品中得到深刻的启发。
    世界各国人民之所以赞美果戈理，还因为果戈理是属于十九世纪俄国文学界的大师之一，这一代的具有革命民主主义倾向的现实主义的文学对于全世界人类的精神上的贡献是不可估量的，而且继承着和发扬了的这种优秀的传统的有苏维埃的文学。如同中国的谚语所说，“饮水思源”，当我们正在从一天天蓬勃发展着的苏维埃文学中吸取丰富的营养时，我们更要礼赞果戈理及其他同时代的俄国作家。    
    我们还要纪念依回历算来，诞生于一千年前的大哲学家、科学家、医学家阿维森纳。
    阿维森纳是回教徒，他生在公元十世纪至十一世纪阿拉伯文化最灿烂的一个时代，他的著作是用当时的回教的知识分子的公共语文——阿拉伯文所写作的。以阿维森纳在哲学与科学上的贡献来说，他配得上全世界人民纪念。
    阿维森纳的成就首先辉煌地表现在医学上面。他拒绝宗教的迷信观念而对于人的生理和病理进行了完全是科学的研究。他反对当时盛行的炼金术和星占术。他的巨著“医学经典”讨论着生理学，病理学，卫生方法，治疗方法，药物学各方面的问题。这个著作在他死后传播到回教国家以外，西欧的许多大学采用他的书作为医学教学的基本教材，直至
    十七世纪末。
    人们称阿维森纳是“亚里斯多德第二”，不是无因的。他和亚里斯多德一样，写出了百科全书式的著作。他的确是中古时期全世界最有学问的人中的
    一个。他不仅是个学问渊博，而且是在哲学思想上有大胆创见的人。与宗教观念相结合着的先验主义在他的时代是“正统”思想，他不顾这种“正统”思想而主张，物质世界并不是神所创造的，一切知识要从实际经验中取得。以这种唯物论思想为基础，他坚持实证的科学研究精神。因而他不仅在医学上，而且在地质学、天文学、化学、物理学、心理学各方面都有其一定的成就。
    阿维森纳的科学研究工作并不是平静地、安稳地进行的。正像一切为真理而战斗的人一样，他曾不得不过着屡经风波的一生。他在医疗上的灵效使他为若干国王所称赏，他曾被任命为大臣，但是专制君主的官廷政治并不是适宜于科学家的暖室。阿维森纳遭受到政治上的挫折，甚至还曾被投入狱中。科学家的良心支持着他，使他在任何环境下都勤勉地工作，为人类探寻走进自然界的秘密和征服自然的道路。
    阿维森纳是中世纪辉煌的阿拉伯文化所孕育出来的大师。在中世纪，大部分欧洲人在科学上文化上处于“黑暗时代”，中国唐朝的文化和阿拉伯文化是当时人类文化的高峰。阿拉伯文化上承古希腊的文化成就，近代的欧洲文化的发展受赐于阿拉伯文化很多。人类文化的总成果是由东方和西方的每一个民族，每一代人的勤恳的努力所累积而成的。在纪念阿维森纳时，使人特别深刻地感觉到这一点。
    我们之所以要纪念雨果，达·芬奇，果戈理，阿维森纳，就是由于这些理由。
    雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳都是在他们所处的时代中和在他们自己的民族中的文化和思想上的先驱者。他们以辛勤的工作来发扬了他们自己民族的文化上的特性，他们的工作促进了各民族之间的相互理解并丰富了人类文化的总成果。他们的成就应该被计算入世界人类文化的总的库藏里边。
    有四千年文化的优秀传统的中国人民敢于接受外国的有进步意义的文化，也善于从外国传来的东西中鉴别好坏美恶。我们在五十年前已有人用文言译出了雨果的杰作“悲惨世界”，鲁迅也在五十年前开始把果戈理的名字介绍给中国人，直至五四运动时，文艺复兴时期的“重新评价一切”的精神对于我们进行反封建的思想斗争曾引起了很大的鼓舞作用。
    一九一七年十月革命后，中国的先进分子开始接受马克思列宁主义的思想，并且从此以后，中国的人民抱着愈来愈强烈的兴趣注意着蓬勃发展的苏维埃文化。中国人民知道，无产阶级的文化思想，苏维埃的文化是人类历史中最进步的文化，是总结了人类历史上的一切进步文化的产物。中国人民热衷地学习社会主义的文化思想和社会主义的一切文化产物，是完全合理的。但同时我们仍要吸取外国历史上的一切进步的文化以丰富我们自己。毛泽东主席说：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料，这种工作过去还做得很不够。这不但是当前的社会主义文化和新民主主义文化，还有外国的古代文化，例如各资本主义国家启蒙时代的文化，凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收。”（“新民主主义论”）
    我们一向严格地区别西方资产阶级没落时期的各种腐败东西和资本主义国家启蒙时代的向上的健康的文化。在近三四十年来，帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义者曾有意识地向中国灌输他们的腐朽的文化。在这种侮辱了人类文化尊严的帝国主义者的产物中包含着的是极端自私自利的市侩主义，因绝望而疯狂颓丧的变态心理，反理性的神秘主义，谋杀，色情，民族的自大狂，道德与正义观念的毁灭，对人类的美感的蹂躏。这一切黑暗的东西不能不为我们所唾弃和排斥。
    过去在国民党反动派的支持下，曾经有一种文化复古论者，他们用继承中国古代文化的名义来排斥
    一切外国的进步的东西。但他们并不是继承中国古代文化的精华，他们是企图复活封建统治阶级的腐朽的东西。而当他们拒绝外国来的进步的文化时，他们举手欢迎好莱坞黄色电影、爵士音乐和法西斯思想。西方帝国主义的腐朽的文化和中国的封建复古主义结成了联盟企图扼杀中国人民的文化的前进。
    中国人民的文化，真正能够继承和发扬中国古代文化的优秀传统，也真正能够吸取外国文化中的精华。在我们自己的民族的悠久历史中有大量的富于人民性的文化遗产，我们以此而自豪，我们也由衷地欣赏和赞美外国各民族的一切优秀的文化成果。
    在纪念雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳时，我们看到一方面他们各各有着不同的个性，不同的造就；另一方面他们又具有着某些共同的东西。这种共同的东西也同样可以从每一个民族每一个时代的优秀的文化创造者的身上发现。他们所共同具备的东西是什么呢？我以为主要的就是以下这些。
    第一、他们都用巨大的努力探索和追求客观的真理。虽然他们的工作的领域互有不同，但在这点上是一致的：他们都不愿在自然界和社会现象的“秘密”面前止步，他们不认为这种“秘密”是不可能知道的，而认为是可以知道的。他们力求用他们的科学研究和艺术力量来打开在人类面前的“秘密”。由于一代代人的这种努力，人类终于渐渐地能够脱离为自然规律和社会规律所支配的状况，而逐渐地取得了支配自然规律与社会规律的能力。因此，我们必须向历史上一切追求真理的战士致敬。
    第二、他们都深切地关怀最广大人民的疾苦。他们关心人民的物质上的痛苦，也关心人民的精神上的痛苦。人民被迫着过没有政治权利的生活，被迫着失去任何生活的理想，这种情形是一切人类进步事业的先驱者所不能容忍的。他们用不同方式来揭露和反对造成人民的痛苦的剥削压迫制度。他们爱自己的民族，他们力求消除灾害人民、灾害民族的文化生活的根源。他们爱自己的祖国，他们敢于与自己祖国中的败类和朽恶现象作战。
    第三、他们对于人类的合理的前途都抱着强烈的希望。虽然他们生活着的时代使他们痛苦，他们自己的生活也包含着痛苦，但他们并不说，人类的前途是绝望的，是要走向毁灭的，恰恰相反，他们以他们自己的工作来使人们相信，希望的光芒是永远在人类面前，照耀着人类前进的。虽然他们自己对于人类的将来的认识常常只能是朦胧的，但他们总是在他们的时代里尽了这样的责任：把不灭的希望的火炬传递给了后人。他们把为真理与自由而战斗，为各民族和平共居的美好世界而战斗的胜利信心感染了同时代的人，也感染了后来的一代代的人。
    对客观真理的追求，对人民疾苦的关心，对人类的合理前途的希望和信心，当我们展开人类文化进步史时，在一切文化先驱者的身上所表现着的最使人感动的共同点，难道不正是这些么？这些文化先驱者既关心自己本民族的自由与进步，又关心各民族之间的和谐的合理的共同生活；因为只有在这种情形下，人类的幸福与文化生活的无限发展才有最大的保障。现在的全世界为和平民主与进步事业而斗争的人民继承了这些文化先驱者的伟大理想，并且正在使这种理想进一步地取得实现的可能。
    但是在当前的世界上，有那么一小撮的帝国主义分子，他们的想法恰恰相反。他们用欺骗的谎话来代替真理的追求，他们所关心的是如何进行杀人的战争而不是如何增进人民的福利，他们用黑暗的阴影来遮盖住人类的前途。他们所最感兴趣的事甚至是：用人做试验品，以进行原子武器和细菌武器的
    “研究”，并拿这种“研究”的成果来更大规模地
    屠杀人类！
    诗人雨果曾经热情地歌唱着“未来的世纪”说：
    “正在力求解放的世界上空，在所有的年轻的民族的头上，和平，在蔚蓝的空中张开两只宽阔的，坚定的翅膀。”雨果的这种希望，毫无疑问也正是每一时代的进步人类的希望。但是今天的帝国主义者把这种伟大诗人的崇高希望看做粪土，他们是如此渴望着把战争魔鬼的黑影压盖到每一个民族的头上！
    当疯狂的美帝国主义者已经只能从跳蚤、虱子、苍蝇、蚊子的身上来寻求自己的出路的时候，他们的眼中是不可能看到雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳和人类文化史上的一切光芒的名字的。
    我们知道，在巴黎的雨果广场上雨果铜像已经在一九四一年为法西斯侵略者所摧毁，而在铜像的原址，现在已装上一个福特汽车公司的模型，标志着金元帝国的势力。当我们听到这样的事情时，不能不和法国人民一样地感到愤怒，因为这不但是侮辱了法国民族的文化，也是侮辱了人类的文化！美帝国主义者及其仆从们就是用这样的可卑的行为来向人类的和平，民主，进步的神圣事业挑战！
    人类的文化绝不畏惧这种挑战。雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳的名字永垂不朽，但那些曾经在他们生前奴役他们，迫害他们的专制君主早已湮没无闻！
    全世界千千万万为和平、民主、进步而斗争的人民绝不容许好战的帝国主义者用他们的毒手来侮辱人类的文化，绝不容许这些罪犯发展他们的绝灭知识，绝灭希望，绝灭人类的黑暗行为。全世界人民为保卫雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳及其他一切伟大的名字所代表的人类优秀的文化传统而斗争！也就是为保卫和平、民主、与进步而斗争！
    由于文化交流的促进而必然加强的全世界人民的大团结，保证着人类的前途有无限的光明。
