　　Reliable Guarantee for Completing the Production Increase and Thrift Campaign
    ——Visiting Industrial Labor Models Qian Jiaguang and Li Xiujun
    I visited Qian Jiaguang (Deputy Director of the Tool Repair Workshop of the State-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory) and Li Xiujun (Deputy Director of the Boiler Workshop of the State-owned Tangshan Power Plant), industrial labor models who came to Beijing to participate in the "May 1st" Labor Day observation ceremony. They excitedly told me about the profound changes that the "Three-Anti" Movement had brought about in their factories. These changes are mainly reflected in the continued improvement of the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers and staff.

    Li Xiujun and Qian Jiaguang are both outstanding labor models who have made important contributions to the country. They have always worked selflessly and devoted themselves to studying technology. However, in the past, they did not clearly understand the difference between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology. They simply believed that "those who own shops are the bourgeoisie, and those who work are the working class," and felt that "the bourgeoisie is one of the four classes in China at present, and the government should also support their development of production and making money through business." Therefore, they naturally could not imagine that there would be bourgeois lawbreakers attacking the working class, and that it was necessary to eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology on the working class. Qian Jiaguang mentioned that in the past, he clearly knew that a corrupt element was often taking kickbacks, but he felt that this was a trivial matter and did not amount to much. After the education of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they have clearly recognized the ideological essence of the bourgeoisie. They said: "These people are selfish and only care about getting rich themselves, regardless of the life and death of others." This change is not only happening among labor models and advanced producers, but is also spreading to every corner. Li Xiujun told me such a small thing: in the past, every spring when pruning branches and repairing houses, the ground was full of branches and sorghum stalks. The children of the workers' families living in the factory would scramble to pick up the branches and sorghum stalks to take home as firewood. This year is different, the branches and sorghum stalks are still scattered all over the ground, but no child picks them up. The children say that these things belong to the state and should be taken to the factory for use as firewood. Children, old ladies, and workers who were previously considered backward now recognize the consistency of national interests and personal interests, and recognize that private individuals should not greedily take advantage of public property. The broad masses of workers and staff are working hard to stand firm and draw a clear line with the bourgeoisie ideologically. Under the leadership of the Party and the trade union, the workers of the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory carried out criticism and self-criticism. Everyone learned to use a class perspective to criticize their own and others' bourgeois selfish and self-interested bad habits. An old carpenter in his fifties, who rarely spoke, donated all the tools he had accumulated over the past two or three decades to the factory. The chairman of the trade union advised him not to do this, but he refused to listen, saying: With the labor insurance regulations, and the state building dormitories for workers, and the elimination of corrupt elements, the country's construction will develop even faster, what do I still need these for! Some workers at the Tangshan Power Plant had to go home to farm for a while after work during the busy farming season. After this movement, the workers consciously refused to do so, fearing that this would distract them and affect production.

    The workers' high degree of class consciousness will become an unlimited driving force for completing the task of increasing production and practicing thrift. In the workshops of Qian Jiaguang and Li Xiujun, there have already been good achievements in production after the "Three-Anti" movement. This year, the production task of the Textile Machinery Factory has increased a lot compared to last year. To complete this batch of tasks, it is necessary to solve the problem of unbalanced production equipment and greatly improve the production efficiency of the gantry planer. The gantry planer is an imported product, and it cannot be added in large quantities for a while; Qian Jiaguang came up with a way to modify the gantry planer into a gantry milling machine to improve production efficiency. This modification work is much more difficult than the trial production of the flyer last year. Qian Jiaguang, whose class consciousness has been further improved through the tempering of the "Three-Anti" struggle, cannot watch the country's production tasks fail to be completed because of fear of difficulties. He closely cooperated with engineer Wang Chuanyu, and with the active support of the workers in the workshop, after six weeks of hard work, the modification of the gantry milling machine was finally successful. The cutting efficiency of the new gantry milling machine is three and a half to eight times higher than that of the gantry planer, which guarantees the Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory to complete the task of increasing production and practicing thrift. The modification work encountered many difficulties. After one problem was solved, another problem came up. Qian Jiaguang often had to repeatedly modify and ponder with his workmates until eleven or twelve o'clock in the evening. He said that if it were not for the "Three-Anti" movement to improve everyone's awareness, the workers would have been annoyed long ago. Similarly, Li Xiujun's boiler workshop, in order to reduce costs and save good coal for other industries, also actively tried to burn local inferior coal after the "Three-Anti" movement. Although some workers initially believed that burning inferior coal would affect the output of the boiler, under Li Xiujun's patient education, everyone strengthened their high sense of responsibility for saving the country and continuously improved technology to overcome difficulties. Good results have been achieved in the trial burning process, and costs have been reduced by more than five percent in the experiment. After "May 1st," they will officially burn inferior coal. In their factories, it has become common for workers to think of ways to save materials and improve quality and output in production. When I asked them if they were confident of completing this year's task of increasing production and practicing thrift, they both smiled excitedly and said: There is absolutely no problem. Because, how many new records and advanced experiences the awakened workers will create in production is now unimaginable. They said that a factory cadre once said: "How many revolutions a machine makes a day can be estimated, but the creativity of the awakened workers is too great to estimate." They believe that this is the most reliable basis for successfully completing the task of increasing production and practicing thrift. （Song Zheng）（With picture）

　　完成增产节约任务有了可靠的保证
    ——访问工业劳动模范钱嘉光、李秀俊
    我访问了来北京参加“五一”劳动节观礼的工业劳动模范钱嘉光（国营天津纺织机械厂工具修配车间副主任）和李秀俊（国营唐山发电厂锅炉车间副主任）。他们兴奋地向我讲述了“三反”运动在他们所在的工厂中引起的深刻的变化。这些变化主要表现在广大职工群众阶级觉悟的继续提高。
    李秀俊和钱嘉光都是对国家有着重要贡献的出色的劳动模范，他们一向忘我地劳动埋头钻研技术。但是他们过去却并不清楚地知道资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想有着什么不同。他们简单地认为“开铺子的就是资产阶级，做工的就是工人阶级”，觉得“资产阶级是中国目前的四个阶级之一，政府还要扶植他们发展生产，做买卖赚钱。”这样，他们自然也就想像不到还会有什么资产阶级不法分子向工人阶级进攻的事情，想不到还需要肃清资产阶级思想对工人阶级的影响。钱嘉光谈起，过去他明明知道有一个贪污分子经常吃回扣，可是觉得这是小事，算不了什么。经过“三反”“五反”运动的教育，他们对资产阶级的思想本质已经认识得清清楚楚了。他们说：“这些人就是自私自利，只顾自己发财，不管别人死活。”这种变化不只是发生在劳动模范和先进生产者中间，而且是普及任何一个角落的。李秀俊告诉我了这样的一件小事：过去，每到春天打树枝和修房子时，地下扔满了树枝子和秫秸。住在工厂里的职工家属们的小孩子们都抢着拣树枝和秫秸回家去当柴烧。今年可不同了，树枝子秫秸仍然散满地，可是没有一个小孩子去拣了。小孩子们说，这些东西都是国家的，应该让厂子里拿去当柴烧。小孩子们、老太太们，以及过去被认为落后的工人，现在都认识到国家利益和个人利益的一致性，认识到私人不应该贪占公家的便宜。广大的工人和职员都在努力站稳立场，从思想上和资产阶级划清界限。天津纺织机械厂的工人在党和工会的领导下开展了批评和自我批评。大家学会了用阶级观点来批判自己身上和别人身上沾染的资产阶级的自私自利的坏习惯。一个五十多岁的从来很少讲话的老木匠把自己过去二三十年积存的工具都献给了工厂。工会主席劝他不要这样，他不肯听，他说：有了劳动保险条例，国家又给工人盖了宿舍，清除了贪污分子后国家的建设将发展得更快，自己还要这些干什么！唐山发电厂有些工人农忙时在下班后还要回家种一会儿地。在这次运动后，工人们自觉地不肯这样做了，他们怕这样会分散精力影响生产。
    工人们高度的阶级觉悟，将要成为完成增产节约任务的无限的动力。在钱嘉光和李秀俊的车间里，“三反”后在生产上已经又有了很好的成就。今年，纺织机械厂的生产任务比去年增加很多，要完成这批任务，必须要解决生产设备不平衡的问题，大大地提高龙门刨的生产效率。龙门刨是进口货，一时不能大批添置；钱嘉光想出了办法，把龙门刨改制为龙门铣以提高生产效率。这个改制工作比起去年试制锭翼是困难得多的。经过了“三反”斗争的锻炼进一步提高了阶级觉悟的钱嘉光，不能因为害怕困难而眼看着国家的生产任务不能完成。他和工程师王传钰密切合作，在车间工人的积极支持下，经过六个星期的坚苦奋斗，改制龙门铣的工作终于成功了。新的龙门铣的切削效能比龙门刨高过三倍半到八倍，使天津纺织机械厂完成增产节约任务有了保证。改制的工作曾经遇到很多困难，这一个问题解决了，另一个问题又来了，钱嘉光经常在深夜十一二点时还要和工友们反复修改琢磨。他说，要不是“三反”运动提高了大家的觉悟，工友们早就烦了。同样的，李秀俊的锅炉车间，为了降低成本，省出好煤给其他工业用，在“三反”后也积极地试烧当地的劣质煤。虽然开始时也有少数工人认为烧劣质煤会影响锅炉出力，但在李秀俊的耐心教育下，大家加强了为国家节约的高度责任心，不断改进技术克服困难，在试烧过程中已经做出很好的成绩，在试验过程中已经降低了成本百分之五多。“五一”以后，他们就要正式燃用劣质煤。在他们的工厂里，工人在生产中想法节约材料提高质量产量，已经成为普遍的情况。当我问起他们今年的增产节约任务有没有把握完成时，他们都兴奋地笑着说：绝对没有问题。因为，觉悟了的工人在生产上将要创造出多少新纪录和先进经验，现在是无法想像的。他们说，有一个工厂的干部曾经说：“机器一天转多少转是可以估计出来的，而觉悟了的工人群众的创造力却是大得无法估计的。”他们认为，这就是胜利地完成增产节约任务的最可靠的根据。  （宋琤）（附图片）
