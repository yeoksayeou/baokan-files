    Soviet Textile Worker Akhmadova
    Zǐ Gāng
    The only female representative in the Soviet trade union delegation, Akhmadova, comes from the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. This republic is in Central Asia, neighboring our Xinjiang, India, and Afghanistan. Tajikistan, on the "Roof of the World" in the Pamir Plateau, used to be desolate and backward. Since joining the Uzbek Republic as an autonomous republic in 1924, and then being reorganized into a union republic in 1929, Tajikistan has been completely transformed.
    The new face of Tajikistan is: the Vakhsh desert basin has become a prosperous cotton-growing area, collective farms have been established, industries manufacturing cotton textiles, silk fabrics, and canned fruits are developing, the mining industry and hydroelectric power stations are also growing, the capital has established a university, and last year a Academy of Sciences was established. The entire republic has many specialized schools. Stalinabad has eight cinemas, as well as theaters and a circus. The republic is connected to other large cities in the Soviet Union by scheduled flights, railways, and highways. Previously, Tajik women were only domestic servants under the oppression of feudal autocracy, but now they have removed their veils and participated in general social labor.
    Akhmadova comes from the capital of the republic, Stalinabad. This place used to be a poverty-stricken village called Jusamibe, but now it is a modern city with a population of 200,000. It was named this way because it was built in the Stalin era. The republic has a total population of 1.5 million. Akhmadova was born six years after the October Revolution, and she has no memory of oppression and exploitation. Her father and mother were both workers. Her father died when she was seven, but her mother raised the children through her own labor. The revolutionary regime gave them all possible care, and there is no distinction between pain and happiness in her history. She said with a smile: "I am a person who grew up after the October Revolution."
    When the Great Patriotic War began, she had just finished the sixth grade. She got married in 1941, but her husband died two years later defending the motherland. Now she lives with her mother.
    We can believe that Akhmadova lives a very happy life. She is the foreman of the Stalinabad Textile Factory. The factory has 3,000 workers, and she leads 55 people, solving their work obstacles and improving production. She started as a foreman in 1949 and has overfulfilled the five-year production quota in the post-war five-year plan, so she has won the Order of Lenin and the Advanced Textile Worker Medal. She has made creations in improving production and saving raw materials. This time, coming to China, she hopes to see textile factories or talk to Chinese female workers about her own work experience.
    She has been elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Tajik Republic since 1947. Each term is four years, and she has served her second term. The Supreme Soviet of the Republic has a total of 290 representatives, and she is one of the 86 female representatives.
    Speaking of life, a satisfied smile appeared on Akhmadova's face. "My monthly salary is 1,200 rubles, excluding bonuses for increased output. As a representative of the Supreme Soviet, I receive an additional 500 rubles. I travel by train free of charge within the republic." She said that the fifth price reduction this time has made her life more comfortable. Every year, she has to go to Moscow twice to attend meetings related to workers. She is one of the members of the factory management committee, participates in literary and artistic activities in her spare time, and also participates in a party history research group. She has been a member of the Party for four years.
    Last year, she went to Poland to attend the May Day celebrations, and this year the factory administration, the trade union, and the workers decided that she would come to New China. She is happy about this long journey: "It takes six days by train from Moscow to our republic's capital, but our people care about you very much. The media between us are books, newspapers, magazines, and movies. Any movies that have been shown in Moscow, we can see in Tajikistan as well. We know about your struggle to smash the Kuomintang reactionary regime headed by Chiang Kai-shek, we know about your land reform, we know how your people fight heroically and work selflessly. Seeing those movies excites us, and even the children of Tajikistan bless you for your success."
    In Beijing, she watched the films "Happy Xinjiang" and "Great Unity of the Chinese Nation." She saw the happy life of all ethnic groups in China after liberation, including the Tajik ethnic group. She said happily, "I saw them on the screen."
    Now Akhmadova's wish is to study textile technology for another four years. Because in the Soviet Union, general textile factory foremen must go through this stage, but she was promoted to foreman because of her excellent work, so she wants to make up for this study.

    苏联纺织女工阿赫玛多瓦
    子冈
    苏联工会代表团中唯一的女代表阿赫玛多瓦来自苏联塔吉克共和国。这个共和国在中亚细亚，和我们的新疆、印度、阿富汗为邻。塔吉克在帕米尔高原的“世界屋顶”上，以前是荒凉、落后的。自从一九二四年以自治共和国的名义参加乌兹别克共和国、一九二九年又改组为加盟共和国以后，塔吉克整个改观了。
    塔吉克的新面貌是：瓦赫什沙漠盆地变成了繁荣的植棉区，集体农庄建立起来了，制造棉织品、丝织品和水果罐头的工业发展着，采矿工业和水力发电站也日益发展起来，首都办了大学，去年又设立了科学院，全共和国有不少专科学校。斯大林那巴德有八个电影院，还有剧院，马戏团。共和国和苏联其他大城市之间有定班飞机、铁路和公路连系着。以前塔吉克妇女在封建专制的压迫下只能作家庭的奴仆，现在则除去了面纱，参加了一般的社会劳动。
    阿赫玛多瓦来自共和国的首都斯大林那巴德。这个地方以前原是一个名叫玖萨姆贝的赤贫村庄，现在却是一个有二十万人口的现代都市。因为它是在斯大林时代建设起来的，所以才这样取名。共和国一共有一百五十万人口。阿赫玛多瓦在十月革命后六年才出生，在她的记忆中已经没有压迫和剥削。父亲母亲都是工人，她七岁时父亲去世，但是母亲靠了自己的劳动把孩子们养大。革命政权给予他们一切可能的照顾，在她的历史中找不到痛苦和幸福的划分。她微笑着说：“我是十月革命以后才生长起来的人啊。”
    卫国战争开始时，她刚读完了六年级。一九四一年结了婚，但是丈夫在两年后为了保卫祖国而牺牲了。现在她和她的母亲住在一起。
    我们可以相信阿赫玛多瓦是生活得很愉快的。她是斯大林那巴德纺织工厂的工长。全厂三千工人，她率领五十五个人工作，为她们解决工作中的障碍，提高生产。她在一九四九年开始当工长，曾在战后五年计划中超额完成了五年的生产定额，因此她获得过列宁勋章和纺织先进者奖章。她在提高生产和节约原料方面都有过创造。这次到中国来很希望看看纺织工厂，或是和中国女工谈谈她自己的工作经验。
    她自一九四七年起就被选为塔吉克共和国最高苏维埃代表。四年一任，她已当了第二任了。共和国最高苏维埃一共有二百九十名代表，她是八十六名女代表中的一个。
    谈到生活，阿赫玛多瓦的脸上泛出了满足的笑容。“我每月工资一千二百卢布，增加产额的奖金在外。作为最高苏维埃代表，另支五百卢布。我在共和国境内坐火车免费。”她说，这次第五次减低物价，使得她的生活更宽裕了。每年为了开职工方面的会议，得两次去莫斯科。她是工厂管理委员会委员之一，业余参加文艺活动，也参加党史研究的小组，她入党已经四年了。
    去年“五一”节她到波兰去观礼，今年工厂行政、工会和工人们又决定她到新中国来。她高兴这次远行：“从莫斯科到我们共和国首都要坐六天火车，但是我们的人民很关心你们，我们之间的媒介是书报杂志，还有电影。凡是在莫斯科放映过的电影，我们在塔吉克也一样看得到。我们知道你们粉碎以蒋介石为首的国民党反动政权的斗争，知道你们进行土地改革，知道你们的人民如何英勇地战斗，忘我地劳动，看到那些电影叫我们兴奋，连塔吉克的孩子们也祝福你们成功。”
    在北京她看了影片“欢乐的新疆”和“中华民族大团结”，她看见了中国各民族在解放后的幸福生活，其中也有塔吉克民族，她高兴地说：“我在银幕上看见他们了。”
    现在阿赫玛多瓦的愿望是再学习四年纺织技术。因为苏联一般纺织厂当工长的必须经过这个阶段，而她却是为了工作优异才提升为工长的，因此她想补足这个学习。
