    Hoping Poets Will Take Action and Encourage Us to Move Forward
    What a proud and joyful thing it is to live in today's New China! The people are leaping forward. As Zhdanov said: "We...are constantly improving every day. We are not like yesterday today, and we will not be like today tomorrow." However, the voice of poetry, as the horn of the times, is now too weak and too poor, and it has not gone to the streets and to every corner. Compared with the reality of our people's lives, this is truly disproportionate.
    Therefore, I ask our poets to take action. We urgently need street poems and paintings like the "TASS Windows" of the Soviet Patriotic War. I hope that the voice of poetry, the horn of our times, coupled with huge propaganda posters, will appear on the streets of major cities as soon as possible to encourage our people to move forward more rapidly.

专栏：来信摘要

    希望诗人们行动起来，鼓动我们前进
    生活在今天的新中国是多么骄傲，多么喜悦的事啊！人民在飞跃前进。正如日丹诺夫所说：“我们……天天都在不断的提高，我们今天不是像昨天那样，而我们明天将不是像今天这样。”但是，作为时代号角的诗歌的声音，现在却是太微弱，太贫乏了，而且它也没有走向街头，走向每一个角落。这和我国人民的现实生活比较起来，真是太不相称啦。
    因此，我要求我们的诗人们行动起来。我们迫切需要如同苏联卫国战争时的“塔斯社之窗”一样的街头诗和画。我希望我们时代的号角——诗歌的声音，配上巨幅的宣传画，尽快地出现在各大都市的街头，鼓动我们人民更迅速地前进。
