    Welcoming the Return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China
    After visiting various parts of the country for more than four months, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China have successfully completed their tasks and are about to leave the capital today and return to Korea. We warmly welcome them and extend our heartfelt greetings and high respect to the Chinese and Korean people's forces and the Korean people who are heroically fighting on the Korean front.
    The representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China traveled extensively this time, from the Yalu River to Hainan Island, from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the Pamir Plateau, covering six major administrative regions, twenty-eight provinces, eleven autonomous regions, and one thousand and fifty-four counties and cities, directly meeting with more than thirty-six million people, and giving a total of five thousand nine hundred and twenty-four reports and radio lectures to more than five million one hundred thousand people. They have detailed the heroic deeds on the Korean battlefield, the spirit of the Volunteer Army in overcoming difficulties, cherishing national resources, and practicing thrift, the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, the brutal crimes of the American aggressors, the victorious situation on the Korean front, especially the tremendous changes in the military strength between the enemy and ourselves after the airplanes and cannons donated by the people of the whole country reached the front line, to the vast people of all ethnic groups and strata throughout the country. These have further inspired the patriotism and internationalism of the people throughout the country, and effectively promoted the work of supporting the front line in various places, and promoted the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles and the movement to increase production and practice economy in various places. At the same time, the representatives also expressed their condolences to the families of martyrs, military dependents, and wounded and sick soldiers in various places, making the hearts of the broad masses of people at home and the soldiers at the front line more closely linked together. We congratulate the representatives on the significant achievements of their work.
    The representatives were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people everywhere they went throughout the country, and personally experienced the love of the people of the whole country for the motherland, for the Volunteer Army, and for the Korean people. The great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai personally received the representatives. The representatives also listened to reports on the work in various places, visited many factories, rural areas, and schools, and personally witnessed the rapid progress of construction undertakings in various aspects throughout the country. We hope that after the representatives return to Korea, they will convey the care of the great leader Chairman Mao for the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army and Korean friends, the love of the people of the whole country for them, the new atmosphere that has emerged in various parts of the country after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, the brilliant achievements in industrial and agricultural production, and the good news that the country is about to begin large-scale economic construction, to the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland and the heroic Korean friends on the Korean front, thereby further inspiring the fighting will of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese and Korean people's forces, and further strengthening the fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea.
    At present, the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare have not stopped, they are stubbornly and unreasonably undermining and obstructing the armistice negotiations, and they are inhumanly and continuously massacring our captured personnel. Brave Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrades, fight even more bravely! Stand vigilantly at your posts, and resolutely, thoroughly, and decisively smash any conspiracies and recklessness of the enemy! Brave Korean people and People's Army comrades, your heroic spirit and unyielding struggle have made a great contribution to the cause of defending world peace. No matter how brutal and cunning the enemy is, victory will always belong to you. In order to fully support you, the Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea will solemnly carry through to the end.

    欢送志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团，在全国各地访问四个多月之后，已经胜利完成了工作任务，今天要离开首都，回到朝鲜了。我们热烈地欢送他们，并向在朝鲜前线英勇战斗的中、朝人民部队和朝鲜人民表示亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意。
    志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的代表们，这次跋山涉水，由鸭绿江直到海南岛，由长江口直到帕米尔高原，足迹走遍六大行政区、二十八个省、十一个自治区、一千零五十四个县市，和三千六百余万人民直接见了面，向五千零一百余万人作了报告和广播讲演共五千九百二十四次，把朝鲜战场上的英雄事迹，把志愿军克服困难、爱护祖国物资和厉行节约的精神，把朝鲜人民英勇斗争和中、朝人民团结友好的情况，把美国侵略者的残暴罪行，把朝鲜前线的胜利形势，特别是全国人民捐献的飞机大炮达到前线以后，在敌我军事力量上所引起的巨大变化，都详细地告诉了各地各民族各阶层的广大人民。这些，都进一步鼓舞了全国人民的爱国主义和国际主义的热情，有力地推动了各地支援前线的工作，推动了各地的“三反”“五反”斗争和增产节约运动。同时，代表们又慰问了各地的烈属、军属和伤病员，使国内广大人民和前线战士的心更加紧密地联系在一起了。我们为代表们此次工作的重大成绩表示祝贺。
    代表们在全国各地，到处受到广大人民的热烈欢迎，亲身体会到了全国人民对祖国、对志愿军与对朝鲜人民的热爱。伟大的领袖毛主席和朱德副主席、刘少奇副主席、周恩来总理亲自接见了代表们。代表们还听取了各地工作情况的报告，参观了许多工厂、农村、学校，亲眼看到了全国各方面建设事业的突飞猛进。我们希望代表们回到朝鲜后，把伟大领袖毛主席对志愿军指战员和朝鲜友人的关怀，把全国人民对他们的热爱，把全国各地在“三反”“五反”斗争以后出现的新气象，把工农业生产上的辉煌成就，把全国即将开始大规模经济建设的喜讯，告诉朝鲜前线上的祖国英雄子弟和英雄的朝鲜友人，借此进一步鼓舞中朝人民部队全体指战员的战斗意志，进一步加强中朝两国人民的战斗友谊。
    目前，美国侵略者进行细菌战的万恶罪行还没有停止，他们正在蛮横无理地破坏和阻挠停战谈判，并且灭绝人性地连续屠杀我方被俘人员。英勇的中国人民志愿军同志们，更加奋勇地战斗吧！警惕地站在自己的岗位上，坚决、彻底、干脆地粉碎敌人的任何阴谋和蠢动！英勇的朝鲜人民和人民军同志们，你们的英雄气概和不屈不挠的斗争，对保卫世界和平的事业作了巨大的贡献。不管敌人如何残暴和诡计多端，胜利永远是属于你们的。为了全力支援你们，中国人民的抗美援朝运动，必将庄严地进行到底。
