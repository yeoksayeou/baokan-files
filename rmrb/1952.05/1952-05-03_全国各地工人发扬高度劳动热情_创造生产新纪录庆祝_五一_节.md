Workers across the country, in the labor emulation movement to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day, have used their labor and wisdom to create many new production records of great significance as a gift to this great festival. These major achievements of the workers across the country not only demonstrate the great creative power of the working class, but also take the lead in creating a clear example for the nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy, which is about to be launched on a large scale.

In the steel and machinery industries, by April 26th, the Tianjin Steel Plant had overfulfilled its gift plan for welcoming "May Day" in all major workshops. Pei Quansheng, technician of the Electrical Department and Electric Furnace Workshop of the plant, and Wang Fengchao, head of the electric furnace team, veteran workers Liu Enpu and Zhao Lianzhong, etc., actively studied advanced Soviet experience, studied technology, and cooperated to solve the serious problem of gas eyes in the production of high-carbon steel in the plant, improved the quality of carbon steel castings, reduced waste products, and increased the output of the electric furnace workshop by 50% over the increase in production and economy plan in late April, estimating that it can save the country more than 1.5 billion yuan annually. This major technological improvement is of great significance for promoting the development of the steelmaking industry and the machinery manufacturing industry. The Wang Qingkun group of the Forging Department of the Third Branch of the Beijing Machine General Factory adopted the Kovalev work method, increasing the daily output of seven-point vertical shaft nuts from 120 to 824. Workers, engineers, and technicians of a state-owned steel plant steel rail yard in Chongqing studied advanced Soviet experience together and modified the roll groove, successfully rolling Soviet-style 38 kg (weight per meter) steel rails on April 16th. This kind of steel rail not only saves steel materials, but also has greater vertical strength than the Hanyang-style 42 kg steel rail, so the train runs smoothly and safely on the track and can run at high speed. This type of steel rail is also easier to roll and has a high qualification rate. Qian Jiaguang, deputy director of the Tool Repair Workshop of the State-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory, and engineer Wang Chuanyu cooperated closely and successfully transformed a gantry planer into a gantry milling machine on April 12th. After the transformation, the cutting efficiency was increased by 3.5 to 8 times compared to the original, and the work quality was also greatly improved. This success enables the plant to save 2.4 billion yuan in funds for purchasing machines, and provides great help in the technology of self-made gantry milling machines in China. Employees of the Northeast No. 18 Machine Factory studied advanced Soviet experience and researched a method for regenerating waste lubricating oil, which can save the country wealth worth more than 128 million yuan annually. The employees of the factory also put forward 31 rationalization proposals and found 53 tricks in the competition. These rationalization proposals and tricks play a significant role in improving output, quality, and saving raw materials. For example, workers Liang Yungong and Wang Xiangui of the Mechanical Workshop jointly created a tire mold, which increased the output of a certain product by five times compared to before. Workers of the Wang Xintian team of the Fushun Machine Repair Factory improved a tire and a bending plate by finding tricks, which increased work efficiency by 19 times compared to before.

In the electrical machinery industry, new production records continue to emerge. On the first day of launching the labor emulation campaign to welcome "May Day" (April 21st), the workers of the heavy motor workshop of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory of the Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee created seven new records, and created four new records in the second and third days. On the first day, Xin Shanfang, Xin Hongkang and other four workers improved the working method of "?Pobo", and completed the work that used to take 56 hours in 22 hours. When grinding the inner circle of the medium-sized motor stator, veteran worker Zhou Xianqing created a new work method, which reduced the time for grinding one stator inner circle from the original 12 hours to only 2 hours and 15 minutes. On the second day, Communist Party member Wang Jinfang, learning Zhou Xianqing's advanced work method, created a new record of grinding 5.5 units in 7 hours, averaging less than 80 minutes per unit. On the third day, Zhou Xianqing further applied the advanced work method and created the latest record of grinding one unit in 40 minutes. The creation of this new work method has increased the work of grinding the inner circle of the medium-sized motor stator by 17 times in three days. In order to be able to supply the needs of the grinding workers in time, the pressing group adjusted the labor organization, improved the method of division of labor and cooperation, and created a new record of pressing 10 rotors or 5.5 stators a day, the former increasing by three times and the latter increasing by one and a half times compared to the original output.

In the chemical industry, many major technological improvements and inventions have emerged. After successfully studying the method of using reclaimed rubber to replace raw rubber in November last year, Ding Hongtao and other technicians of the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 further improved the formula method in this competition, so that the raw rubber content reached the international standard. In this way, the country can save 104 tons of raw rubber a year, which can make 630,000 more pairs of rubber shoes. Employees of the Synthetic Workshop of Dalian Chemical Factory solved the ten key problems in workshop production by finding topics, which can create wealth worth nearly 7 billion yuan for the country every year. In addition, the employees of the workshop put forward 381 rationalization proposals, of which 281 have been adopted. Due to the joint efforts of technicians and workers in a workshop of Dalian Petroleum Factory, three major production key problems that had not been solved since the start of construction were solved, so that the oil yield increased by 30.8%, creating an unprecedented new record since the establishment of the factory.

In the paper industry, new achievements of great significance have also emerged. Workers and technicians of the Copper Mesh Branch of Northeast No. 6 Paper Mill cooperated closely, and after four years of painstaking research, successfully manufactured domestically produced phosphor bronze mesh for the first time from April 16th to 21st. Phosphor bronze mesh is an important equipment in the paper industry, and paper pulp can be made into paper only after it passes through it. In the past four years, they created the equipment for manufacturing copper mesh and the raw material for manufacturing copper mesh - phosphor bronze. Finally, with the enthusiastic help and guidance of Soviet experts, they produced three relatively complex phosphor bronze "long nets" for manufacturing high-quality paper. After trial use, the quality of this phosphor bronze "long net" exceeds the product standards of Japan, Britain, and the United States, and the cost is more than half cheaper than buying it from abroad. The employees of the factory presented these three "long nets" as a gift for "May Day" with great pleasure. In this competition to welcome "May Day", the workers in the steaming chamber of the Northeast No. 5 Paper Mill created a new national record of steaming a pot of pulp in 4 minutes and 8 seconds on April 19th, after creating a new national record of steaming a pot of pulp in 5 minutes and 51 seconds in December last year.

In the transportation sector, many new records have appeared, and good news continues to come. Employees of the Shanghai Train Section of the Shanghai Railway Administration Branch created a new national record of 2 million safe kilometers on April 24th after four months of efforts. In these four months, they eliminated 156 traffic liability accidents, prevented 26 traffic accidents, and 16 death and injury accidents. According to incomplete statistics, the resulting reduction in the loss of state property is more than 3 billion yuan. The No. 1124 chartered train team of the Northeast Suihua Locomotive Section has not had any accidents for more than four years from January 1948 to April 15th this year, and has safely traveled 373,000 kilometers, creating a new national record for safe travel of freight locomotives in the country. Now they are still continuing to strive for safe travel of 400,000 kilometers. Sun Yucheng, a model driver of a state-owned automobile transportation team in Xinjiang, has safely traveled 47,800 kilometers in the past year and a half, saving the country 66 million yuan.

In the coal mine, a new national record for pneumatic pick coal mining appeared on April 28th. Chen Bihua, a young pneumatic pick operator and Communist Party member of the Xinzhuangzi Coal Mine of the State-owned Huainan Mining Bureau, mined 291.6 tons of coal in 5 hours and 47 minutes on a longwall working face with the cooperation of coal hewers. The competition movement in the Chengzi Mine of Mentougou, West Beijing, has increased the daily output by 20% compared to before. Under the slogan of "Creating New Records to See Chairman Mao", the workers of the Third Rapid Tunneling Team of the Second Inclined Shaft dug a well underground on the 24th, with a daily advance of 25.9 meters (the daily advance was 5 meters to 14 meters in the past), creating a new record for the entire mine.

In other business departments, employees are also working selflessly to accumulate national wealth and improve people's lives. The workers in the boiler workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant burn a large amount of inferior coal without reducing the steam temperature. From April 1st to 21st, the coal consumption cost has been reduced by 7.6% compared to the original plan; Zhang Yinchun, a lathe operator in the repair workshop, adopted the multi-tool multi-blade cutting method when turning the cylinder lock nut, which increased the work efficiency by more than two times. The Liu Dezhen team of the factory completed a day's work in four hours when dismantling and repairing the bearings of the power thrust machine. Yu Tonghe, a worker in the Mechanical Department of the China People's Printing Factory, recently invented an automatic electric gate, which uses alternating current to drive a direct current generator, saving a lot of coal and labor, and can save the country about 540 million yuan annually. The summer clothing production of the Beijing Clothing Factory has been completed 12 days ahead of schedule, saving the country 6 billion yuan. Employees of the Shenyang Clothing Factory No. 3 researched six new operating methods in five days; after these new operating methods were adopted, the work efficiency was greatly improved, such as after the hand sewing workers adopted the quick needle pulling operation method, the number of clothes made by each person increased from 15 sets a day to 30 sets. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the employees of the Tianjin Water Supply Company continued to improve technology and operating methods, so that the movement to increase production and practice economy advanced by leaps and bounds. For example, after the workers in the boiler room changed to burning Datong coal fines, they can save 500 million yuan throughout the year. Starting from May 1st, the company decided to reduce the water price by 5.88%, and the selling price of every 100 gallons of tap water was reduced from 850 yuan to 800 yuan. According to preliminary estimates, it can directly and indirectly save Tianjin citizens 1.44 billion yuan in expenses by December this year.

The major technological improvements and inventions of workers in various places demonstrate the great creativity of the working class. The emergence of this creativity is because workers in various places have been continuously receiving communist ideological education since liberation and have been tempered by the "Three-Anti" movement, and their labor consciousness and collective heroism have been further developed.

At present, employees in various places continue to actively put forward rationalization proposals in various aspects, strive to find tricks and promote advanced experience, and carry out large-scale labor emulation to ensure that they complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy ahead of schedule and overfulfill the task.

    全国各地工人发扬高度劳动热情
    创造生产新纪录庆祝“五一”节
    全国各地工人在迎接“五一”国际劳动节的劳动竞赛运动中，用自己的劳动和智慧创造出许多有重大意义的生产新纪录，作为向这一伟大节日的献礼。各地工人们的这些重大成就，不仅显示了工人阶级伟大的创造力量，而且率先为全国即将大规模开展的增产节约运动创造出鲜明的范例。
    在钢铁和机器业中，天津钢厂到四月二十六日止，各主要车间都提前超额完成了迎接“五一”节的献礼计划。该厂机电部电炉工场技术员裴铨生和电炉班长王凤朝、老工人刘恩璞、赵连仲等积极学习苏联先进经验，钻研技术，通力合作解决了该厂炼制高炭钢一贯出气眼的严重问题，提高了炭钢铸件的质量，减少了废品，使电炉工场四月下旬的产量超过增产节约计划百分之五十，估计全年可为国家节约十五亿元以上。这项重大的技术改进，对于推动炼钢工业和机器制造工业的发展，有重大意义。北京机器总厂三分厂锻工部王清坤组，采用了郭瓦廖夫工作法，七分立轴螺母日产量从一百二十个增加到八百二十四个。重庆某国营钢铁厂钢轨场工人、工程师、技术员一道，研究苏联先进经验，改装了轧辊辊槽，在四月十六日轧制苏联式三十八公斤（一公尺重量）钢轨成功。这种钢轨不仅节约钢料，并且比汉阳式四十二公斤钢轨直立强度大，所以火车在轨道上行驶时平稳、安全，并可高速度行驶。这种钢轨轧制也比较容易，合格率大。国营天津纺织机械厂工具修配车间副主任钱嘉光和工程师王传钰等密切合作，在四月十二日改造龙门刨为龙门铣成功。改造后切削效能比原来提高三倍半到八倍，工作质量也提高很多。这一成功使该厂可以节省添置机器的资金二十四亿元，并对我国自制龙门铣在技术上有很大的帮助。东北第十八机器厂职工学习苏联先进经验，研究出废润滑油再生办法，每年可给国家节省价值一亿二千八百余万元的财富。该厂职工并在竞赛中提出三十一件合理化建议，找出五十三个窍门。这些合理化建议和窍门对提高产量、质量和节约原料方面都起很大作用。如机械车间工人梁运功、王显贵共同创造了一个胎具，使某项产品的产量较前提高了五倍。抚顺机修厂王心田小组工人由于找到窍门改进了一个胎和一个弯板，使工作效率较前提高了十九倍。
    在电机工业方面，生产新纪录不断涌现。华东军政委员会工业部上海电机厂重电机车间工人在展开迎接“五一”节劳动竞赛的第一天（四月二十一日），就创造了七次新纪录，第二、三两天又创造了四次新纪录。第一天忻善芳、忻洪康等四个工人改进了“?婆司”的工作方法，在二十二小时内完成了过去需要五十六小时的工作。老工人周贤庆在磨中型马达定子内圆时，创造了新工作法，把磨一只定子内圆的时间从原来的十二小时缩减到只要二小时十五分钟。第二天共产党员王金芳，学习了周贤庆的先进工作法，在七小时内，又创造了磨好五点五只的新纪录，平均不到八十分钟就磨一只。第三天周贤庆又进一步运用先进工作法，创造了四十分钟磨一只的最新纪录。这一新工作法的创造使磨中型马达定子内圆的工作，在三天内提高了十七倍。压装组的工人为了能及时供应磨工的需要，就调整了劳动组织，改进分工合作的方法，创造了一天压十只转子或五只半定子的新纪录，前者比原来产量提高三倍，后者提高了一倍半。
    在化学工业中，出现了许多重大的技术改进和发明创造。东北橡胶四厂技术人员丁洪涛等，继去年十一月研究利用再生胶代替生胶的方法成功后，又在这次竞赛中进一步改进配方方法，使生胶含量达到了国际标准。这样，一年就可给国家节省一百零四吨生胶，能多做六十三万双胶鞋。大连化学工厂合成车间职工用找课题的办法，解决了车间生产中的十大关键问题，每年可为国家创造价值近七十亿元的财富。此外，该车间职工们并提出三百八十一件合理化建议，其中被采纳的已有二百八十一件。大连石油工厂某车间由于技术人员和工人共同想办法，解决了开工以来一直没有解决的三个重大生产关键问题，使出油率提高了百分之三十点八，创建厂以来空前的新纪录。
    在造纸工业中，也出现了意义重大的新成就。东北第六造纸厂铜网分厂工人和技术人员密切合作，经过四年的苦心钻研，在四月十六日到二十一日首次制造国产磷青铜网成功。磷青铜网是造纸工业的重要设备，纸浆经过它才能制成纸张。在四年中，他们创建了铜网制造的设备，创制了制造铜网的原料——磷青铜。最后他们在苏联专家的热情帮助和指导下，制出了制造上等纸张用的比较复杂的磷青铜“长网”三张。经过试用证明，这种磷青铜“长网”的质量超过日、英、美各国产品标准，成本比由国外购买便宜一半以上。该厂职工以非常愉快的心情把这三张“长网”作为“五一”节献礼。东北第五造纸厂车间蒸解室工人，在这次迎接“五一”的竞赛中，继去年十二月创造五点五十一分钟蒸煮
    一罐纸浆的全国新纪录之后，在四月十九日再次创造了四点零八分蒸煮一罐纸浆的全国新纪录。
    在交通运输部门中，新纪录已出现不少，现在捷报仍不断传来。上海铁路管理分局上海列车段职工，经过四个月的努力在四月二十四日创造了二百万安全公里的全国新纪录。在这四个月当中，他们消灭了行车责任事故、防止了行车事故一百五十六件，商务事故二十六件，死伤事故十六件。据不完全统计，由此而减少的国家财产的损失在三十亿元以上。东北绥化机务段一一二四号包车组，从一九四八年一月起到今年四月十五日止，四年多中没有出过任何事故，安全行驶三十七万三千公里，创造了全国货运机车安全行驶的全国新纪录。现在他们仍继续为争取安全行走四十万公里而奋斗。新疆某国营汽车运输队模范驾驶员孙玉成，在最近一年半中安全行驶四万七千八百公里，为国家节省了六千六百万元。
    煤矿方面，四月二十八日又出现了风镐采煤的全国新纪录。国营淮南矿务局新庄子煤矿青年风镐手，共产党员陈毕华在长壁式工作面上，在攉煤工的配合下，用五小时四十七分钟采煤二百九十一点六吨。京西门头沟城子矿的竞赛运动，已使日产量较前增加百分之二十。二斜井第三快速掘进小组工人，在“创造新纪录，去见毛主席”的口号下，二十四日坑下挖井，日进二十五公尺九十公分（过去日进五公尺到十四公尺），创造了全矿新纪录。
    在其他企业部门，职工们也正为积累国家财富和改善人民生活，进行着忘我的劳动。石景山发电厂锅炉车间的工人，在不减低蒸气温度的条件下，大量烧用劣煤，从四月一日到二十一日，煤耗成本已比原订计划降低了百分之七点六；修理车间镟工张荫春在镟化汽缸锁母时，采用多刀多刃切削法，提高了工作效率两倍以上。该厂刘德珍小组，在拆修发电推力机的轴承时，四小时完成了一天的工作。中国人民印刷厂机务科工人郁同和，最近发明了自动电闸，用交流电推动直流发电机，节约了很多煤炭和劳动力，每年约能给国家节省五亿四千万元。北京被服厂的夏季衣服生产，已提前十二天完成任务，给国家节省人民币六十亿元。沈阳被服三厂职工在五天中研究出六种新的操作方法；这些新操作法被采用后，大大地提高了工作效率，如手缝工采取快拔针操作法后，每人由原来一天做十五套衣服增加到三十套。天津市自来水公司职工在“三反”运动后，不断改进技术和操作方法，使增产节约运动阔步前进。如锅炉房工人改烧大同煤末后，全年即可节省五亿元。五月一日起，该公司决定降低水价百分之五点八八，每一百加仑自来水的售价从八百五十元降到八百元。据初步估计，到今年十二月止，可直接和间接为天津市民节省开支十四亿四千万元。
    各地工人的重大技术改进和创造发明，显示了工人阶级的伟大创造力。这种创造力的出现，是因为各地工人从解放以来，不断接受共产主义思想教育和经过“三反”运动的锻炼，劳动的自觉性和集体英雄主义有了进一步的发扬。
    目前，各地职工继续积极地提出各方面的合理化建议，努力寻找窍门和推广先进经验，开展大规模的劳动竞赛，保证要提前和超额完成增产节约任务。
