    The living standards of workers in state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have recently improved again. In order to further stimulate the production enthusiasm of workers and complete and overfulfill this year's economic construction plan, the Northeast People's Government recently decided, based on the index of increased labor productivity, the current production level, and the state's financial strength, to increase workers' wages by an average of 9 percent from April, with a 10 percent increase in the industrial sector (and an 8 percent increase in other sectors). The Northeast People's Government also decided to implement a system of technical allowances, seniority allowances, and regional allowances with a focus on key areas starting this year, in order to reward workers for their efforts in learning technology, specializing in their work, and appropriately improving the lives of workers in remote areas and areas with harsh climates.

    The average basic monthly wage of workers in factories and mines is now equivalent to over 252.6 percent of their wages in 1948. Since 1949, the collective welfare of workers has also been continuously improved. The state allocates large amounts of funds every year for the construction of various welfare projects for workers. The number of sanatoriums for workers in the entire region has increased from only four in 1949 to twelve now. There are a total of 123 after-work sanatoriums in factories and mines, 209 nurseries, 1,729 libraries, and more than 4,000 clubs.

    The gradual improvement of workers' lives in Northeast China is based on the development of production. In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign of 1950, the total value of increased production and savings of factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department was equivalent to 12 million tons of grain. Therefore, the actual wage income of workers has also greatly increased. In particular, the increase in workers' income is even more significant in units with rapid increases in labor productivity. For example, in the new plant processing workshop of Machine Factory No. 6, the multi-tool and multi-edge cutting method was created and promoted during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, and the wage income of many workers increased by 50 to 100 percent. The elimination of corrupt elements and the improvement of production efficiency in the "Three-Anti" Movement also improved the lives of workers.

    With the restoration and development of production, the living welfare and safety and health of workers in Shanghai have been significantly improved.

    Since the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations by the Central People's Government, as of January this year, 720 factories and enterprises with more than 100 employees in Shanghai have implemented labor insurance, and more than 339,500 employees have enjoyed labor insurance benefits. Sixteen industries and 151 factories with less than 100 employees have signed collective labor insurance contracts in accordance with the spirit of the Labor Insurance Regulations, and more than 36,400 employees enjoy this benefit.

    Before liberation, the medical and health facilities for workers in Shanghai were very poor. Since liberation, the number of worker hospitals has increased from six hospitals with 325 beds to twelve hospitals with 1,514 beds. In addition, more than 110 hospitals have been organized into mutual aid groups to undertake special medical work for factories that have implemented labor insurance. Medical rooms and sanatoriums have also been generally established within factories. There were no labor health stations before liberation, but now 37 have been established. Nearly 400 factories have established labor health systems, and 2,887 specially trained workshop health workers provide services to workers anytime and anywhere. After the establishment of labor health stations, the health of workers in small and medium-sized factories, which account for 86 percent of the city's total number of factories, has been guaranteed. In addition, some factories have also set up rest rooms, after-work sanatoriums, and nutritious canteens to protect the health of workers. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Railway District Trade Union, and the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union have successively established worker sanatoriums in West Lake in Hangzhou and the seaside of Qingdao. More than 3,000 labor models, advanced producers, outstanding trade union cadres, and activists in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have taken turns to recuperate there.

    Over the past two years, safety and hygiene in factories have improved. According to a survey by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, from July of the year before last to June of last year, 398 factories in the city made significant improvements to safety and hygiene equipment such as ventilation, dust removal, and electrical protection, with expenditures of 38.3 billion yuan. Last summer, after all cotton textile factories in the city improved ventilation equipment and reduced workshop temperatures, they basically prevented workers from suffering from heatstroke and heat exhaustion. At present, safety guards have been installed on machines with belt rotations in general factories, greatly reducing work-related injuries.

    In terms of factory maternal and child health care, there have also been great improvements and developments since liberation. Two maternal and child health stations have been established in Hudong and Husi to conduct prenatal examinations and deliveries for pregnant female workers, and to check and prevent diseases for infants.

    Under the policy of municipal construction serving the working people, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has vigorously improved the environmental sanitation of workers' residential areas, and has successively built sewers, renovated roads, added water storage pools and garbage cans, and installed tap water and street lights in many workers' residential areas. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government is also planning to build workers' housing, and 1,002 households have now been completed. In addition, collective dormitories, dining halls, and bathrooms built by various factories are also increasing day by day.

### 东北区各公营厂矿职工生活水平提高  上海工人生活福利和安全卫生显著改善

    东北区各公营厂矿职工生活水平提高
    上海工人生活福利和安全卫生显著改善
    东北各公营厂、矿的职工生活水平，最近又普遍提高了一步。东北人民政府为进一步发挥职工的生产积极性，以完成并超额完成今年的经济建设计划，最近特根据劳动生产率提高的指标、目前生产水平和国家财政力量，决定自四月份起，将职工工资平均提高百分之九，其中产业部门提高百分之十
    （其他部门提高百分之八）。东北人民政府并决定自今年起，有重点地施行技术津贴、厂龄津贴和地区津贴等制度，以奖励职工努力学习技术，使工作专业化，并适当地改善在偏僻地区和气候不良的工矿区工作的职工的生活。
    现在，各厂、矿职工每月所得的平均基本工资，已相当于一九四八年所得工资百分之二百五十二点六强。自一九四九年以来，职工的集体福利事业也在不断地改善。国家每年都拨出大量的资金，为职工进行各种福利事业的工程建筑。全区的职工疗养院，一九四九年只有四处，现在已增加到十二处。各厂、矿的职工业余疗养所共有一百二十三所，托儿所有二百零九处，图书馆有一千七百二十九处，俱乐部有四千多个。
    东北职工生活的逐渐改善，是建立在发展生产的基础上的。在一九五零年的增产节约运动中，东北工业部所属各厂、矿增产节约总值等于一千二百万吨粮食。因此，职工的实际工资收入，也有了很大增加。特别是劳动生产率提高很快的单位，职工收入增加的情形更加显著。如机器六厂新厂加工车间，在增产节约运动中创造并推广了多刀多刃切削法，许多工人的工资收入就增加了百分之五十至一倍以上。各厂、矿在“三反”运动中，清除了贪污分子，提高了生产效率，也使职工生活得到改善。

    随着生产的恢复和发展，上海工人的生活福利和安全卫生已得到显著的改善。
    自中央人民政府颁布劳动保险条例以来，到今年一月，上海已有七百二十个百人以上的工厂企业实行了劳动保险，有三十三万九千五百多职工享受到劳动保险待遇，百人以下的工厂企业已有十六个行业和一百五十一个厂根据劳动保险条例的精神，订立了劳动保险集体合同，享受这一待遇的职工有三万六千四百多人。
    解放前，上海的工人医疗卫生和保健设施是很坏的。解放以来，工人医院已由六个院三百二十五张床位增加到十二个院一千五百一十四张床位，另有一百一十多家医院被组织成互助组，为实行劳动保险的各厂担任特约医疗工作。各工厂内部还普遍设立了医疗室和疗养所。劳工保健站在解放前根本没有，现已建立了三十七处。近四百个工厂已建立了劳工保健制度，有二千八百八十七个受过专门训练的车间保健员随时随地为工人服务。劳工保健站建立后，占全市工厂总数百分之八十六的中小工厂的职工的健康就得到了保障。此外，有些工厂里还举办了休养室、业余休养所和营养食堂等，以保障工人的健康。上海总工会和上海铁路区工会、上海邮电工会等单位，还先后在杭州西湖和青岛海滨设立了工人休养所。劳动模范、先进生产者、优秀的工会干部和“三反”、“五反”运动中的积极分子轮流到那里休养的已有三千多人。
    两年多来，各工厂的安全卫生都有改进。据上海市人民政府劳动局的调查，自前年七月至去年六月，全市已有三百九十八个工厂对通风、吸尘、防电等安全卫生设备作了显著的改进，所用经费达三百八十三亿元。去年夏季，全市各棉纺织厂改进通风设备、降低车间温度后，已基本上防止了工人中暑和发痧的疾病。目前，一般工厂有皮带转动的机器上都装设了安全防护罩，使工伤事故大为减少。
    在工厂妇幼卫生保健方面，解放以来也有很大的改善和发展。沪东、沪西已建立了两个妇幼保健站，给怀孕女工进行产前检查和接生，给婴儿检查疾病和防治疾病。
    在市政建设为劳动人民服务的方针下，上海市人民政府大力改进了工人住宅区的环境卫生，先后在许多工人住宅区建设了下水道，翻修了路面，增添了蓄水池和垃圾箱，装置了自来水、路灯。上海市人民政府还正在有计划地建筑工人住宅，现在已建成一千零二户。此外，各厂自行修建的集体宿舍、膳堂、浴室也在逐日增多。
