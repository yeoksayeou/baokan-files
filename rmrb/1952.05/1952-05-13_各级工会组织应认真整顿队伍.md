    All Levels of Trade Union Organizations Should Conscientiously Rectify Their Ranks
    During the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many trade union organizations have already adopted various methods to conscientiously rectify their ranks, and the prestige and combat effectiveness of the trade unions have been greatly improved as a result. However, the development of trade union organization rectification work is still very uneven. Some trade union cadres believe that carrying out the "Three-Anti" movement in trade union organs is "unnecessary," and they do not pay enough attention to the rectification of organizations.
    Judging from the situations that have already been exposed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, this argument that "trade union organizations have no major problems" is completely unfounded. Facts have long proven that bourgeois illegal elements regard our trade union organizations as one of their main targets for attacking the working class. In some local trade union organizations, spies sent by illegal capitalists and traitors who were pulled over by illegal capitalists have been discovered. Such trade union organizations obviously cannot play any combat role.
    Among trade union cadres, the bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses is普遍existing to varying degrees. Some trade union cadres are infected with bad work styles, are accustomed to using coercive methods to treat the masses, and cannot take good care of the masses' hardships; in some primary trade unions in factories and mines that have not undergone democratic reform and where the trade union democratic system is unsound, many feudal foremen and even counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated; even in places where democratic reforms have been carried out, the cleaning up of bad elements is not thorough enough. After these bad elements got into the trade unions, they opposed the administration, stirred up trouble and sabotaged unity in the trade unions, doing bad things that were detrimental to production and the workers. These situations must arouse the serious attention of trade union workers.
    Leading cadres at all levels of trade unions must face up to the problems existing in trade union work, be good at using the good conditions that the masses have already mobilized, and take effective methods to conscientiously rectify the organization according to the specific circumstances. It is necessary to further mobilize the masses, clean up bad elements, remove incompetent cadres who are seriously divorced from the masses, conduct re-elections seriously, and promote a large number of outstanding activists who have been tested in this struggle and have close ties with the masses to the trade union organization. At the same time, establish and improve financial and democratic systems, fully expose and criticize the bureaucratic work style of trade union cadres, and continue to improve the class consciousness and ideological level of the broad masses of cadres and the masses. In this way, trade union organizations can be further expanded and consolidated, and play a greater role in promoting the great movement to increase production and practice economy.

### 各级工会组织应认真整顿队伍

    各级工会组织应认真整顿队伍
    在“三反”“五反”运动中，许多工会组织已经采取各种方式，认真地整顿了自己的队伍，工会的威信和战斗力因而大大提高。但是，工会整顿组织工作的发展还是很不平衡的。有些工会干部认为在工会机关开展“三反”运动是“多此一举”，对于整顿组织很不重视。
    从“三反”“五反”运动中所已经暴露的情况看，这种“工会组织问题不大”的论调是毫无根据的。事实早已证明，资产阶级不法分子是把我们的工会组织当作他们向工人阶级进攻的主要对象之一的。有些地方的工会组织内部发现了不法资本家派来的坐探，和被不法资本家拉过去的叛徒。这样的工会组织显然是不能发挥什么战斗作用的。
    在工会干部中，脱离群众的官僚主义作风在不同程度上是普遍存在的。有的工会干部沾染了坏作风，习惯用强迫命令的办法对待群众，不能很好地关心群众疾苦；有些还未经过民主改革、工会民主制度不健全的厂矿的基层工会，混入不少封建把头以至反革命分子；就是已经进行了民主改革的地方，对坏分子清洗得也还不彻底。这些坏分子钻进工会以后，就和行政闹对立，在工会中拨弄是非、破坏团结，做出不利于生产、不利于工人的坏事。这些情况，必须引起工会工作者的严重注意。
    各级工会领导干部必须正视工会工作中存在的问题，善于运用群众已经发动起来的这一良好条件，根据具体情况，采取有效的方法认真整顿组织。要进一步发动群众，清洗坏分子，撤换严重脱离群众的不称职的干部，认真进行改选，提拔大批经过这次斗争考验的、和群众有密切联系的优秀的积极分子到工会组织中来。同时，建立和健全财务制度和民主制度，充分揭发和批判工会干部的官僚主义作风，继续提高广大干部和群众的阶级觉悟和思想水平。这样，工会组织才可以进一步地扩大并巩固起来，在伟大的增产节约运动中发挥更大的推动作用。
