The Chinese medical, bacteriological, and biological experts Wu Zhizhong, Qin Yaoting, Xin Jun, and professors Wei Wenbin, Zhu Fengchun, Sun Xipu, and Yang Keqin, who participated in the anti-bacterial warfare work in Northeast China, expressed their outrage and condemned the heinous crimes of the American bacterial warfare criminals after seeing the news of the American air force prisoners of war confessing that the United States was using bacteriological weapons on a large scale, when speaking to reporters from the Xinhua News Agency.

In their talks, the experts and professors unanimously pointed out: Since American imperialism launched bacteriological warfare on Chinese and Korean territory, we have had factual evidence witnessed by people in various places and scientific evidence obtained through laboratory tests, all of which unequivocally prove the crime of American imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare. However, Acheson, Ridgway, and their ilk have repeatedly and shamelessly denied it. The various facts confessed by the American air force prisoners of war this time further expose the inside story of the American bacteriological warfare. We cannot suppress the anger in our hearts towards those American scientists co-opted by the Wall Street oligarchs, such as Wilson, Ashforth, and Clark, who have actually stolen the scientific achievements of mankind to slaughter humanity with their bloody crimes. People can see that these murderous beasts want to use air and drinking water to spread bacteria-laden dust, and use insects and rodents that have been cultivated for several generations under laboratory conditions to spread many strange and rarely heard-of bacteria. They even boast about the power of atomic and hydrogen bombs, conducting all kinds of brutal and unparalleled murderous experiments. All of this clearly shows that the bloodthirsty Wall Street robber barons are the mortal enemies of all mankind. Peace-loving people all over the world should once again recognize the evil nature of American imperialism from this and unite to wage a resolute struggle against these robbers.

The experts and professors further confirmed the crime of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons on our territory with their research results from the anti-bacterial warfare struggle over the past few months. Xin Jun, a bacteriological expert and chief technician of the Changchun Infectious Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute, said: "The various flies scattered by American imperialism in Northeast China have been identified as containing pathogenic bacteria such as typhoid, paratyphoid, and meningitis. From a scientific point of view, not only should these flies not appear in the cold climate at that time, but the bacteria contained in these flies are also an abnormal phenomenon, because there were no similar epidemics occurring locally at that time. Therefore, these flies were undoubtedly artificially cultivated by American imperialism to strengthen their cold resistance. The conclusion of our scientific research is consistent with the confession of the American air force prisoners of war." Qin Yaoting, an entomology expert and director of the Biology Department of China Medical University, said: "American air force prisoner of war Quinn confessed that a person named Ashforth said that the insects used to spread bacteria could withstand the cold and survive for a long time without eating, which is completely consistent with the situation of the insects scattered by American aircraft that I identified. For example, the black springtail (called 'snow flea' by the Japanese) that I identified can survive in a climate of minus ten degrees Celsius and move on the ice. After the ice melts, the bacteria and viruses it carries can flow into the river and harm peaceful residents. Another example is the tick, which can live for a year without eating. Our past scientific research conclusions are consistent with the facts personally stated by the American air force prisoners of war. This proves that the facts we exposed in the past are very cautious, responsible, and absolutely true." Wu Zhizhong, an internal medicine expert and Dean of Education of China Medical University, said: "The containers used to spread bacteria or germ-carrying insects confessed by the American air force prisoners of war are the same as the containers dropped by American imperialism in Northeast China, especially the bacterial bombs we found in Changbai County, Liaodong Province, and the bacterial bombs found in Kuandian County, which are indeed a kind of 'non-explosive bombs'." Yang Keqin, a surgery professor at China Medical University, pointed out: "American imperialism's bacteriological warfare was prepared long ago. Since 1940, many articles on bacteriological warfare have appeared in the American 'Journal of Immunology', 'Journal of Infectious Diseases', and 'Journal of Bacteriology'. The authors of these articles mostly belong to the 'Biological Department of the Detrick Chemical Corps'. This chemical corps is one of the important bases for American imperialism's large-scale preparation of bacteriological warfare. A report published in the October 1950 issue of the American 'Journal of Immunology' revealed that the staff researching tularemia alone numbered 163, and another 809 people participated in the experiments. The confessions of the American air force prisoners of war and the materials we saw in American magazines both put air transmission and insect transmission in the first and second places of spreading bacteria methods, which is enough to prove that they have been studied for a long time."

In their talks, the experts and professors unanimously concluded that the bacteriological warfare carried out by American imperialism could not achieve its expected results. Over the past few months, our anti-bacterial warfare struggle has achieved significant victories. Facts have proved that although American imperialism has dropped a large number of poisonous insects here, due to the heroic fighting spirit of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, and the formation of a strong people's epidemic prevention line, we have victoriously wiped out various poisonous insects and prevented the spread of epidemics. We believe that with the correct leadership of the People's Government and the strength of the broad masses, no matter how vicious and cunning American imperialism carries out bacteriological warfare, we will be able to completely smash its conspiracy.

### 在东北参加反细菌战工作的专家、教授就美国战俘供词对新华社记者发表谈话

    在东北参加反细菌战工作的专家、教授就美国战俘供词对新华社记者发表谈话
    在东北参加反细菌战工作的我国医学、细菌学、生物学专家吴执中、秦耀庭、辛钧和教授魏文彬、朱逢春、孙锡璞、杨克勤等，看到了美国空军俘虏供认美国大规模地使用细菌武器的消息后，对本社记者发表谈话，愤怒斥责美国细菌战犯的滔天罪行。
    专家们和教授们在谈话中一致指出：自从美帝国主义在中朝国土上进行细菌战以来，我们已经有了各地人民目睹的事实根据，又有了经过化验检查出来的科学证据，都确凿无疑地证实了美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行，但是艾奇逊、李奇微之流却一再无耻抵赖；这次由美国空军俘虏亲口供认出来的种种事实，又进一步地揭开了美国进行细菌战的黑幕。我们对于那些为华尔街的寡头们所御用的美国科学家如威尔逊、阿西福克、克拉克等，居然盗用人类的科学成果来屠杀人类的血腥罪行，实在不能抑止胸中的愤怒。人们可以看出：这些杀人野兽们要利用空气和饮水来传播带有细菌的尘埃，用在实验室的条件下培养了好几代的昆虫和啮齿动物来传播很多奇怪的和不常听到的细菌；他们甚至吹嘘着原子弹和氢弹的威力，进行着一切残暴绝伦的杀人试验。所有这些，都十分明显地说明：嗜杀成性的华尔街的强盗头子们是全人类的死敌。全世界爱好和平的人民，都应该从这里再一次地认识美国帝国主义的罪恶本质，团结起来向这些强盗们进行坚决的斗争。
    专家们和教授们都用他们数月来在反细菌战斗争中的研究成果，进一步证实美帝国主义在我国领土上使用细菌武器的罪行。细菌学专家、长春传染病防治院总技师辛钧说：“美帝国主义在东北所撒布的各种蝇类，已经判明其含有伤寒、副伤寒和脑膜炎等病原菌。从科学的观点来看，不仅这些蝇类在当时寒冷的气候不应该出现，就是这些蝇类所含的细菌也是一种反常现象，因为本地在当时并没有任何类似的流行病发生。因此，这种蝇类无疑地是美帝国主义用人工培养方法加强了它的耐寒能力。我们的科学研究的结论，与美国空军俘虏所供认的是相符的。”昆虫学专家、中国医科大学生物系主任秦耀庭说：“美国空军战俘奎恩供认那个名叫阿西福克的人曾经说过：用来撒布细菌的这些虫子可以耐寒，并且不吃东西也能活得很长久，这和我所鉴定的美国飞机撒布的昆虫情况完全一致。譬如我所鉴定的黑跳虫（日本人叫它‘雪蚤’），它在零下十度的气候里还能生存，并且活动在冰上，在冰块融化以后，它所携带的细菌和病毒，便可流入河中危害和平居民。再如壁虱，它可以一年不吃食物还能生活。我们过去的科学研究结论和现在美国空军俘虏亲自说出来事实是一致的。这证明了我们过去所揭发的事实，是十分谨慎的，负责的，千真万确的。”内科学专家、中国医科大学教育长吴执中说：“美国空军俘虏供认的用以撒布细菌或带菌毒虫的容器，和美帝国主义在我东北投掷的容器也是相同的，特别是我们在辽东省长白县发现的细菌弹和在宽甸县发现的细菌弹，确实是一种‘不爆炸的炸弹’。”中国医科大学外科教授杨克勤指出：“美帝国主义进行细菌战是早有准备的，在一九四零年以后美国出版的‘免疫学杂志’、‘传染病杂志’、‘细菌学杂志’上面，就有许多篇关于细菌战的文章，它们的作者大都属于‘狄特里克营化学兵团生物部’，这个化学兵团是美帝国主义大规模地准备细菌战的重要基地之一。一九五零年十月号美国‘免疫学杂志’上发表的一篇报告中透露：仅仅在那里研究土拉伦斯菌这种病的工作人员，就有一百六十三人，另外还有八百零九人参加试验。美国空军俘虏的供词和我们在美国杂志上所看到的材料，都是把空气传染和昆虫传染放在撒布细菌方法的第一位和第二位，这足以证明他们是经过长期研究的。”
    专家们和教授们在谈话中，最后一致认为：美帝国主义所进行的细菌战是不可能达到它所预期的效果的。几个月来，我们的反细菌战的斗争已经取得了重大的胜利。事实证明，美帝国主义虽然在这里投掷了大批毒虫，但由于我国人民在毛主席和人民政府的领导下，发挥英勇的战斗精神，组成了强大的人民防疫战线，因而胜利地扑灭了各种毒虫，防止了疫病的流行。我们相信：有了人民政府的正确领导，有广大群众的力量，不管美帝国主义如何狠毒和狡猾地进行细菌战，我们必能彻底粉碎它的阴谋。    （新华社）
