Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS Moscow, 18th: "Pravda" published a dispatch from Dekachenko in Pyongyang, reporting on the atrocities of the American secret police on Geoje Island. Dekachenko wrote: In Korea, Geoje Island is called the American Maidanek (Note: There was a German concentration camp there during World War II). Now, this small island of 300 square kilometers is surrounded by six electrified wire fences. The American secret police have established dozens of concentration camps and prisons there to detain captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as civilians forcibly driven out of North Korea during the retreat of the intervention forces.

In the bacterial and chemical laboratories on Geoje Island, living people are used for experiments with poison gas, plague, cholera, and other germs.

Geoje Island has become the tomb of tens of thousands of people slaughtered by American butchers. In January and February of this year alone, more than 7,000 Korean patriots were shot or hanged. In just two days—February 18 and May 1—670 people were shot under the fabricated "crime" of inciting prisoner-of-war rebellion.

Due to the heinous experiments with bacteriological weapons, typhus and plague have claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people.

Recently, bloody atrocities on Geoje Island have been particularly frequent. The U.S. military authorities are sending one punitive expedition after another there.

Dekachenko then cited letters from three soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers who recently escaped from Geoje Island, reporting on the cruel atrocities on Geoje Island.

One of them, a staff sergeant named Chai Chengyu (transliteration), wrote: "The terrible persecution I suffered on Geoje Island, and the terrible persecution that our brothers are still suffering there at the hands of the American fascists, is difficult to describe in words. Being captured by the U.S. military is like entering hell, and not the ordinary hell that can be imagined from books and myths, but a much more terrifying hell... I was detained in the 76th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. This prisoner-of-war camp is just a row of dark and dirty barracks, with nothing on the bunks and very humid air; this prisoner-of-war camp has eighteen torture chambers, six so-called steam rooms, where American executioners put the 'troublemakers' among the prisoners of war and subject them to unbearable torture at extremely high temperatures, often resulting in death; there are four gallows, which are set up to punish captured personnel. The American beasts treat prisoners of war worse than livestock. We only eat two meals a day—one in the morning before being driven out to do hard labor, and one in the evening. The so-called meal is just very thin sorghum millet porridge."

Dekachenko described the situation after the well-known Dodd incident. He wrote that, according to newspaper reports, from the time Dodd was released on May 10, the intervention forces conducted a large-scale "purge" of the prisoner-of-war camps, transporting away all the prisoners who had been tortured and subjected to medical experiments, as well as those who refused to sign in blood on the so-called "petition for free repatriation." Then, batches of prisoners of war were transferred from other prisoner-of-war camps to fill their places. According to newspaper reports, on May 13, a guerrilla team attacked a motorcade carrying prisoners of war north from Busan, rescuing more than 170 captured personnel from the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. These prisoners of war were from Geoje Island. They broadcast a letter to the people of Korea and China on a guerrilla radio station. The summary of this letter is as follows: "Dear brothers and sisters of Korea and China! The American demons on Geoje Island are using unprecedented brutal methods against our captured personnel. Truman, the American executioners and murderers, have turned the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island into torture camps and death camps for experimenting on captured personnel with chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons, and atomic weapons...

The aggressors massacre, hang, and poison hundreds of our brothers, wantonly violating international law. But the murderers and executioners cannot destroy the will of the Korean and Chinese patriots. No threats or abuse from the aggressors can make the prisoners of war betray their motherland."

Dekachenko finally said that the bloody suppression of prisoners of war on Geoje Island and the aggressors' attempt to use prisoners of war as cannon fodder have aroused the indignation of the people of Korea and China, as well as all honest people in the world. This indignation is growing. The people of Korea and China have resolutely come forward to stop the American criminals.

    引证最近逃出来的我方被俘人员的信件
    揭露美国侵略者在巨济岛上的血腥暴行
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”刊载的德卡诚科的平壤通讯，报道了美国秘密警察在巨济岛上的暴行。德卡诚科写道：在朝鲜，巨济岛被称为美国的麦丹尼克（按：在第二次世界大战时那里设有德国的集中营），现在，这个三百平方公里的小岛，周围设有六道通电流的铁丝网。美国的秘密警察在那里设立了好几十个集中营和监狱，以拘禁朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘的战士，以及干涉军撤退时从北朝鲜强迫赶出来的老百姓。
    在巨济岛上的细菌与化学实验室里，活人被用来作毒气、鼠疫、霍乱与其他病菌的试验。
    巨济岛已经成为被美国屠夫们残杀的成千成万人的坟墓。在今年一月和二月间，有七千名以上的朝鲜爱国志士被枪毙或被绞死。仅在两天以内——二月十八日和五月一日——就有六百七十人在莫须有的煽动战俘叛乱的“罪名”下被枪毙。
    由于细菌武器的罪恶试验，伤寒和鼠疫已经使成千成万人丧命。
    最近巨济岛上的血腥暴行尤其频繁。美军当局一支又一支的讨伐队接着往那里派遣。
    德卡诚科接着引证最近从巨济岛上逃出来的朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军三个战士的信件，信内报告了巨济岛上残酷暴行的情形。
    其中有一个名叫柴诚玉（译音）的上士写道：“我在巨济岛上所受过的恐怖迫害，和在美国法西斯分子手中的我们的弟兄们仍然在那里受着的恐怖迫害，是难以用言语形容的。被美军俘获，就是进了地狱，而且不是从书本和神话中可以想像得到的普通地狱，而是一个可怕得多的地狱……我曾被拘留在巨济岛上的第七十六号战俘营，这个战俘营就是一排阴暗而肮脏的营房，里面的铺上没有铺着任何东西，空气十分潮湿；这个战俘营中有十八间酷刑室，六间所谓蒸气室，美国刽子手们把战俘中间的
    ‘谋乱者’放在这种房间里，使他们在极高的温度下受难以忍受的折磨，其结果往往是死亡；有四个绞架，是为惩罚被俘人员而设的。美国禽兽们对待战俘比对牲口还坏。我们一天只吃两餐——早上被赶出去做苦工以前吃一餐，傍晚吃一餐。所谓饭只是很稀的高粱小米粥。”
    德卡诚科叙述了人所共知的杜德事件发生后的情况。他写道，根据报纸消息，从五月十日杜德获释的时候起，干涉军就对战俘营进行大规模的“清洗”，把所有受过拷打和医学试验的俘虏，以及拒绝用血在所谓“要求自由遣返请愿书”上签名的俘虏都运走了。然后由其他战俘营调去一批批的战俘补充他们的位置，据报纸上的消息说，在五月十三日，一支游击队曾进攻一支装载着战俘的由釜山北上的汽车队，救出了一百七十多名人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员。这些战俘是来自巨济岛的。他们在一个游击队的电台上广播了一封致朝中人民的信。这封信的摘要如下：“朝鲜和中国的亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！巨济岛上的美国恶魔正在对我方被俘人员使用前所未闻的残暴手段。杜鲁门、美国的刽子手和杀人犯们，已经把巨济岛上的俘虏营变成了用被俘人员来试验化学武器、细菌武器和原子武器的酷刑营，变成了死亡营……
    侵略者屠杀、绞死及毒死成百的我们的弟兄，横暴地违反了国际法。但是杀人犯和刽子手们决摧毁不了朝鲜与中国爱国者的意志。侵略者的任何威胁或虐待都不能使战俘们背叛他们的祖国。”
    德卡诚科最后说，巨济岛战俘所受的血腥镇压，侵略者利用战俘充当炮灰的企图，已引起朝鲜和中国全国人民以及全世界一切诚实人民的愤慨。这种愤慨正与日俱增。朝中人民已十分坚决地出来制止美国的罪犯。
