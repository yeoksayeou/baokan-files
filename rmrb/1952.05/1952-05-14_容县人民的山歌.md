The Folksongs of the People of Rong County
Volunteer Army Returning Delegate Li Sen

    In early March, we arrived in Rong County in southern Guangxi. Here, there is no frost or snow all year round. We left Beijing wearing cotton-padded coats and trousers, but here we had to change into single layers. The new wheat had already begun to sprout, and the kapok flowers were blooming red. The continuous, unique, and precipitous mountain peaks are dotted with clusters of green pines and verdant bamboo. Rong County is a beautiful and rich place. The farmers of Rong County are carrying out the land reform and land reform review struggles, breaking the shackles of feudal oppression, and celebrating happy and joyful days. When we arrived, they excitedly sang folk songs to welcome us.
    The folk songs here are famous, but there are especially many folk songs this year. The singing is full of the determination to resist America and aid Korea and the love for the Volunteer Army. When we arrived in Rong County, in the ranks of the thousands of people welcoming us, there were twenty or thirty young men and women who had traveled from dozens of miles away, their faces smiling like flowers, clapping their hands, and singing at the top of their voices, pouring out their inner feelings:
    Kapok flowers bloom red and red,
    Heroes come to Rong County City,
    Thousands of people scramble to see,
    Hearts bloom with joy, cannot contain.

    Hands pick fresh flowers with smiles,
    Compose a folk song to sing about Korea.
    The front lines have won great victories,
    Singing folk songs, hearts are sweet.

    We walked through the warm applause and singing, deeply realizing that every cheer and every song showed the people of Rong County's love for the Volunteer Army.
    With excitement, we reported to the people of Rong County about the heroic struggles on the Korean front. After listening to the report, some people were moved to tears, and some immediately excitedly sang folk songs. After the report meeting, a young farmer sang:
    Today I saw the faces of heroes,
    Returning home to plow the fields with joy.
    Mobilizing the whole family to work hard together,
    Increase production and practice economy to support the front lines.

    Then a young man in his twenties stood up and sang:
    A clap of thunder responds throughout the world,
    Heroic stories are remembered in the heart.
    The heroes' marksmanship is accurate,
    Our hoes dig deep.

    The liberated farmers of Rong County have widely launched a high-yield competition movement. Many mutual aid groups have initiated a high-yield movement of a thousand catties per mu. The farmer brothers are working diligently in the fields, carefully studying and improving farming methods. These two folk songs vividly express the determination of thousands of farmers to increase production and practice economy to support the Volunteer Army.
    The people of Rong County, who love the Volunteer Army, are taking care of the families of the Volunteer Army with the greatest enthusiasm. The following folk song is popular in Rong County:
    Military families are like our own parents,
    Everyone keeps them in their hearts.
    Brother fights devils in Korea,
    Plowing the fields and cutting grass, I'll help.

    Respecting the families of martyrs and soldiers and giving preferential treatment to them has become a social trend here. Farmers in Wu Di Township sent more than a thousand bundles of firewood and grass, as well as many glutinous rice candies and other New Year's gifts to the families of martyrs and soldiers during the Spring Festival. We saw that farmers in the Seventh District had already started spring plowing for the families of martyrs and soldiers. The military families are living happily under the enthusiastic care of the government and the people. A military family member specially wrote me a letter, which contained the following folk song:
    Pomegranate flowers bloom red,
    Son joining the army, mother is glorious.
    Mother's hands are rough and her feet are strong,
    Deep plowing and meticulous cultivation for a good harvest.

    Son in Korea, don't worry,
    Kill more devils and make great contributions.

    These loud and powerful songs will forever inspire us to move forward!

    容县人民的山歌
    志愿军归国代表  李森
    三月初旬，我们到了广西南部的容县。这里长年不见霜雪。我们是穿着棉袄、棉裤离开北京的，到这里就得换单衣了。这里新麦已开始吐穗，木棉花开得通红。连绵不断、奇突峻峭的山峰上，点缀着一丛丛的青松翠竹。容县是美丽、富饶的地方。容县农民正在进行土地改革和土地改革复查的斗争，打碎了封建压迫的枷锁，欢度幸福、快乐的日子。我们到的时候，他们兴奋地唱着山歌欢迎我们。
    这里的山歌是有名的，但今年山歌特别多，歌声里充满了抗美援朝的决心和热爱志愿军的情感。我们到容县时，在欢迎我们的数千群众的行列里，有二、三十个男女青年从几十里地以外赶来，脸笑得像鲜花一样，拍着巴掌，引吭高歌，倾吐他们内心的情感：木棉花开红又红，英雄来到容县城，千人万人争着看，心花乐开收不拢。
    手摘鲜花笑绵绵，
    编首山歌唱朝鲜。
    前线打了大胜仗，
    口唱山歌心里甜。
    我们在热烈的掌声和歌声中走过，深深体会到每一欢呼，每一个歌声都显示出容县人民对志愿军的热爱。
    我们怀着兴奋的心情，向容县人民报告了朝鲜前线的英勇斗争。听了报告以后，有的人感动得流出了眼泪，有的人马上激动地唱出了山歌。在报告大会以后，有个青年农民唱着：
    今天见了英雄面，
    回家犁田犁得欢。
    动员全家齐努力，
    增产节约支援前线。
    接着又有一个二十多岁的小伙子，站起来唱：
    一声响雷天下应，
    英雄故事记在心。
    英雄枪法打得准，
    我们锄头锄得深。
    翻身后的容县农民，广泛地掀起了丰产竞赛运动。许多互助组发起了每亩千斤的丰产运动。农民兄弟们正在田里辛勤地耕作着，细密地研究改进耕作法。这两首山歌，生动地表现了千万农民的增产节约，以支援志愿军的决心。
    热爱志愿军的容县人民，以最大的热情照顾着志愿军的家属。在容县流行着这样一首山歌：
    军属好比亲爹娘，
    人人记挂在心肠。
    哥在朝鲜打鬼子，
    耕田割草我来帮。
    尊敬烈属军属和优待烈属军属，在这里已成为社会风气。务底乡农民在春节中给烈属军属送了一千多捆柴草，还有许多糯米糖等过年礼物。我们看到七区农民已着手替烈属军属进行春耕。军属们在政府和人民的热情照顾下，生活是愉快的。有个军属特意写了一封信给我，里面有这样一首山歌：
    石榴开花石榴红，
    儿子参军妈光荣。
    妈妈手粗脚也壮，
    深耕细作好收成。
    儿在朝鲜莫牵挂，
    多杀鬼子立大功。
    这些嘹亮有力的歌声，将永远鼓舞着我们前进！
