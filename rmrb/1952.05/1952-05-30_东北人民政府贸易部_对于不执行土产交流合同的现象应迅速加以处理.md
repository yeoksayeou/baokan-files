    Northeast People's Government Trade Department
    Should Promptly Address the Phenomenon of Non-Execution of Native Produce Exchange Contracts
    Comrade Editor: This North China Regional Materials Exchange Conference thoroughly reviewed the contract agreements signed by various regions at last year's North China Materials Exchange Conference. Most of the entangled and unresolved contract agreements have been resolved, but there are still a few contract agreements that have not been resolved. Such as certain contracts and agreements signed by the Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department and the Liaodong Provincial Native Produce Company with various regions that have not been executed. The Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department signed an agreement with the Baotou Textile Guild of Suiyuan Province to purchase 80,000 pounds of handmade wool yarn. The office initially said it could execute part of it, but later said it could not. The Department Store Section of the Tianjin Office of the Northeast Trade Department signed an agreement with the Northwest Regional Native Produce Company to purchase 20,000 jin of wool yarn and sweaters, but the office later refused to execute it. The Northeast Liaodong Provincial Native Produce Company signed three contracts with the Xianning Trade Company of Hubei Province to purchase 100,000 jin of bamboo strips, 80,000 bamboo shoulder poles, and 12,000 jin of Mao bamboo. Now that the goods have been shipped, the Liaodong Provincial Native Produce Company still owes part of the payment. The company insists that the Hubei Xianning Trade Company go to Liaodong to settle the accounts, causing the agreement to be delayed and unable to be executed. There are more than 20 disputes between the Northeast Region and various regions regarding agreements and contracts that have not been resolved. The Contract Agreement Inspection Committee of this North China Regional Materials Exchange Conference has repeatedly urged the office to send responsible cadres to the meeting to negotiate a solution, but the office only sent a section chief from the Department Store Section. This section chief said: "I can only be responsible for canceling the agreement, and I cannot revise other conditions," and said: "Please go to the Northeast to resolve it." Various regions are very dissatisfied with the phenomenon of these trade organizations in the Northeast Region not seriously executing agreements and contracts. Some regions would rather sell their native produce to other regions at a lower price than sell it to the Northeast. If this situation is not corrected immediately, it will seriously hinder the development of national materials exchange. The Northeast Trade Department should conduct a thorough inspection and handling of these irresponsible departments that disregard the reputation of state-owned enterprises and do not seriously execute contract agreements, and hopes to publicly respond.

    东北人民政府贸易部
    对于不执行土产交流合同的现象应迅速加以处理
    编辑同志：这次华北区物资交流大会，对去年各地在华北物资交流大会上订立的合同协议作了彻底的检查。大部分纠缠未决的合同协议，已经得到了解决，但仍有少数合同协议未能解决。如东北贸易部驻津办事处及辽东省土产公司等单位和各地订立而未执行的某些合同、协议等。东北贸易部驻津办事处曾和绥远省包头市纺织公会订立购买手工毛线八万磅的协议，该处开始说能执行一部分，后来又说不能执行。东北贸易部驻津办事处百货室曾和西北区土产公司订立购买毛线、毛衣二万斤的协议，而该处后来又不愿执行了。东北辽东省土产公司和湖北省咸宁贸易公司订立合同三件，要购买竹篾十万斤、竹扁担八万根、毛竹一万二千斤。现在货已运到，但辽东省土产公司尚欠款一部。该公司一定要湖北咸宁贸易公司到辽东去结账，致使协议拖延不能执行。东北区和各区所订的协议、合同发生纠纷而没有得到解决的共有二十余件。这次华北区物资交流大会合同协议检查委员会曾数次催该处派负责干部到会协商解决，但该处只派来一个百货室科长，这位科长说：“我只能负责撤销协议，不能改订其他条件”，并说：“请到东北去解决”。各地对东北区这些贸易机构不认真执行协议、合同的现象很不满意。有些地区，宁愿把土产贱价卖给别的地区，也不愿卖给东北。这种情况如不立即纠正，就会严重地障碍全国物资大交流的开展。东北贸易部应对这些不负责任，不顾国营企业信誉，不认真执行合同协议的部门，迅速作彻底的检查与处理，并希公开答复。　常熙权
