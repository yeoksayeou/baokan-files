The Ma Wenzhi team, which has challenged all coal mine drilling teams in the Northeast region, is an advanced drilling team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau. In last year's production increase and economization campaign, the Ma Wenzhi team overcame empiricism and conservative thinking, earnestly studied advanced Soviet experiences, boldly improved technology and management methods, and created the highest drilling record in the country. From the start of the well on August 21st last year to November 5th last year, the Ma Wenzhi team used a Soviet 500-meter drilling rig and averaged 7.99 meters of drilling per day. From December 15th last year to February 26th this year, under the rock conditions of one-fifth granite and conglomerate, two-fifths sandy conglomerate, and two-fifths sandstone, they drilled a total of 596 meters, averaging 8.37 meters per day (more than twice the general average efficiency).

Ma Wenzhi Team's Technical Improvements

The Ma Wenzhi team has made many improvements in operating technology. These improvements have enabled them to speed up drilling, shorten auxiliary production time, and increase drilling time, thereby greatly improving drilling records while ensuring project quality and reducing accidents.

The Ma Wenzhi team broke with conservative thinking, accelerated the rotation speed of the drilling rig, implemented rapid drilling, and improved drilling speed. In the past, when using a 500-meter drilling rig, the slow gear at 85 revolutions per minute and the medium gear at 120 revolutions per minute were generally used. However, the Ma Wenzhi team boldly changed the pulley of the motor (from 204 mm to 250 mm) to increase the rotation speed. After several tests, the fast gear at 248 revolutions per minute could be used when drilling to a depth of no more than 150 meters and when lifting the drill pipe; the medium gear at 154 revolutions per minute could be used at a depth of 150 meters to 650 meters; and the slow gear at 94 revolutions per minute was only used when encountering granite and conglomerate. The Ma Wenzhi team, based on the depth of drilling and different geological conditions, accelerated the rotation speed of the drilling rig as much as possible, breaking through the past habit of generally using slow and medium gears, and greatly improved the efficiency of drilling work.

The Ma Wenzhi team paid close attention to shortening auxiliary production time and increasing drilling time. They created a method of using two sets of sedimentation pipes with mud and sand for replacement. The rock powder, coal powder, soil, etc., crushed by the drilling rig during drilling are washed into the sedimentation pipe by water. When lifting the drill pipe to take the core and change the drill bit, the mud, rock powder, etc., in the sedimentation pipe must be removed before the pipe can be installed and used again. This used to take 20 to 30 minutes each time, totaling one to two hours per day. The Ma Wenzhi team came up with a solution: prepare two sets of sedimentation pipes, and after lifting the drill pipe and removing the sedimentation pipe, install the other pipe and continue drilling immediately. In this way, one to two hours of drilling time is added each day. The Ma Wenzhi team also came up with a method of not stopping drilling when taking cores and lowering river sand. Originally, when taking cores and lowering river sand, it took about 30 minutes each time to stop drilling at a depth of 400 meters to 500 meters, and three times a day would take about 90 minutes of drilling time. Now, it has been changed to put the river sand down during drilling, and only stop drilling when the sand reaches the bottom of the borehole, so the daily drilling time has been increased a lot.

They learned from the Soviet method of using yellow mud slurry to protect the borehole wall, which ensured safety and saved casing. In the past, during drilling, a circular iron casing was required between the core tube and the borehole wall to protect the borehole wall and prevent the collapse of small pieces of rock and rock powder. After using the method of protecting the borehole wall with yellow mud slurry, the impact force of the water was reduced, thus increasing the resistance to the pressure on the borehole wall and reducing the collapse of small pieces of rock and rock powder. At the same time, the slurry can also hold up the collapsed rock and rock powder to prevent it from sinking, reducing the time to clean the bottom of the well and avoiding accidents. In addition, the use of yellow mud slurry not only saved a large number of casings, but also saved the time to recover the casings after drilling was completed. The Ma Wenzhi team has initially gained experience in the process of using slurry, that is: when drilling hard rock, less loess should be mixed, and when drilling soft rock (especially shale), a large amount of loess should be mixed. Now the Ma Wenzhi team has created a record of not using casing for a borehole 700 meters deep. (Note: When using yellow mud slurry, it is necessary to use clean water to wash the mud slurry on the pipe when lifting the drill pipe to check the wear of the pipe.)

When encountering conglomerate and granite, iron sand drill bits must be used, and iron sand must be added. The experience of the Ma Wenzhi team proves that in this case, lengthening the water inlet of the iron sand drill bit and adding more iron sand can not only increase drilling time and reduce the time of lifting and lowering the pipe, but also prevent accidents. In order to add more iron sand, they changed the water inlet of the drill bit from 30 mm long to 90.15 to 200 mm long. The amount of iron sand used depends on the size of the drill bit. Three kilograms are used for a 100 mm drill bit each time, two kilograms are used for a 75 mm drill bit each time, and one kilogram is used for a 55 mm drill bit each time. At the beginning, many people thought that there was a danger of "pipe clamping" if too much iron sand was added, and advocated using a handful of iron sand. The Ma Wenzhi team broke with convention. Facts have proved that if too much iron sand is added, the hole diameter will be roughened, and small rock pieces will not be able to clamp the drill pipe. At the same time, more iron sand means longer wear time, which also increases drilling time. However, when using iron sand, a "drill bit connector" (called "handshake" by workers) must be connected between the core tube and the drill bit to prevent damage to the thread of the core tube. Now, the Ma Wenzhi team has been able to safely use iron sand drill bits and iron sand in boreholes 700 meters deep.

The Ma Wenzhi team also paid attention to maximizing the efficiency of the water pump. The more water is injected into the well, the faster and safer the drilling speed will be. In the past, drilling workers did not understand this principle and only used about two-thirds of the water power, and one-third of the water was wasted. The Ma Wenzhi team overcame obstacles and maximized the function of the water pump by 100%.

The Ma Wenzhi team also improved the high-speed steel drill bit. Originally, eight pieces of high-speed steel were obliquely inlaid on a 75 mm drill bit, but now it has been changed to sixteen pieces of high-speed steel obliquely inlaid in two parallel rows, thus increasing the durability and drilling force of the drill bit; test results show that the efficiency is increased by more than 30%. In order to increase the water output of the drill bit, they adopted the following methods of inlaying drill bits according to different rock formations: when drilling soft shale, the outer opening is enlarged by 1.5 to 2 mm to increase the contact surface, so the water output is also large. When drilling conglomerate formations, the diamond steel is inlaid in the center to form a convex shape and inlaid with a staggered pattern, so the progress is fast and safe. When drilling slate, the water inlet is not cut, and the diamond steel is inlaid high, so that the water rushes out from under the diamond steel, with great force and fast progress.

Management Improvements of the Ma Wenzhi Team

The Ma Wenzhi team has a set of strict management systems, which were established and consolidated in the political life of self-criticism and mutual criticism.

They implemented a dedicated responsibility system and strengthened discipline. The Ma Wenzhi team has a total of 22 people (six new reserve personnel are currently being trained). Among them, there is one team leader who is responsible for administrative leadership and technical guidance; it is divided into three shifts, day and night (24 hours is a work cycle), each shift has five people, one person is on rest, and four people are regularly working. The four people have a clear division of labor. The quality of the work of the gate operator is an important key to determining the speed of drilling, the accuracy of the core, and whether safe work can be guaranteed. In the past, everyone operated randomly, often hindering work. The Ma Wenzhi team has the shift leader specifically responsible for the gate operator. A series of inspection work centered on ensuring safety and rapid drilling, such as stirring mud slurry, checking faucets, checking rock powder, paying attention to the return of water, checking the temperature of the motor, checking the crossbeam of the gantry to pull the drilling tools, and sorting out tools, are all responsible for by certain personnel. Therefore, they have never had any accidents involving dropping pipes, burying pipes, or any other liability accidents.

The Ma Wenzhi team also formulated four systems: First, strictly implement the handover system to strengthen the coordination between shifts. Their three shifts come 15 minutes early and leave 15 minutes late every day. During this time, the person on duty introduces the situation to the person taking over, or helps the shift to repair the machinery. The things they explain are the situation in the well, the operation of the machine, materials and tools, original records, and the number of cores. Second, strictly implement the inspection system. The items they inspect include: core records, machine tools, the quality of the threads of the drill bit and drill pipe for lifting and lowering pipes, water volume and water patterns, and material consumption. Third, establish a record chart system for each shift. The record chart shows the efficiency, progress, quality, and actual completion of the entire team and each shift. This method aroused the enthusiasm of the various teams to compete with each other. Fourth, hold a meeting once a week to review work and make suggestions to each other. In case of urgent problems, hold meetings to discuss them at any time.

Although the Ma Wenzhi team has made great achievements and gained a lot of experience, there are still some difficulties that need to be overcome vigorously, such as, when encountering soft rocks, efforts should be made to use two water pumps at the same time, and the drill bit should be able to be used for more than eight hours in hard rock formations, and so on. The Ma Wenzhi team also has a more important shortcoming, that is, the time spent on moving and installing drilling equipment is too long, which affects the overall efficiency of drilling. In addition, the efficiency per worker is still far behind the actual efficiency of drilling. Therefore, the leadership of the Fuxin Mining Bureau and the drilling team should assist them as soon as possible to overcome difficulties, correct shortcomings, and accelerate the progress of drilling projects. The Ma Wenzhi team should also guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work hard to study their business, and continue to move forward. (Attached picture)

    阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组的先进经验
    煤矿工会东北区委员会  阜新矿务局
    向东北区各煤矿钻探小组挑战的马文志小组，是阜新矿务局的一个先进的钻探小组。在去年的增产节约运动中，马文志小组克服了经验主义和保守思想，认真地学习了苏联先进经验，大胆地改进了技术和管理方法，创造了全国最高的钻进纪录。从去年八月二十一日开井，到去年十一月五日止，马文志小组使用苏联五百公尺钻机，平均每天钻进七点九九公尺。从去年十二月十五日起，到今年二月二十六日止，在五分之一的花岗岩和砾岩、五分之二的砂砾岩、五分之二的砂岩的岩层条件下，共钻进五百九十六公尺，平均每天钻进八点三七公尺（比一般平均效率提高二倍多）。
    马文志小组在技术上的改进
    马文志小组在操作技术方面的改进很多。这些改进使他们加快了钻进速度，缩短了辅助生产时间，增加了钻进时间，因而大大提高了钻探纪录，同时保证了工程质量，减少了事故。
    马文志小组打破了保守思想，加快了钻机的转数，实行快速钻进，提高钻进速度。过去，使用五百公尺钻机，一般都是用一分钟八十五转的慢轮和一百二十转的中轮。但是，马文志小组却大胆地改换了电动机的皮带轮（由二百零四公厘改为二百五十公厘），把回转速度加快。经过多次试验，在钻进孔深不超过一百五十公尺和提钻杆时，都可以使用二百四十八转的快轮；在孔深一百五十公尺至六百五十公尺之间，可用一百五十四转的中轮；在遇到花岗岩和砾岩时，才用九十四转的慢轮。马文志小组根据钻进深浅和地质情况的不同，尽可能地加快钻机的转数，突破了过去一般用慢轮和中轮的习惯，大大地提高了钻探工作的效率。
    马文志小组十分注意缩短辅助生产时间，增加钻进时间。他们创造了用两套带泥沙的沉淀管更换使用的办法。在钻机钻进时所磨碎的岩粉、煤粉、泥土等，都被水冲入沉淀管。上升钻杆取岩芯换钻头时，必须把沉淀管中的泥土岩粉等取出，然后才能把管子装上继续使用。这样做，每次需要二三十分钟，每天合计要费一两小时。马文志小组想出了办法：准备下两套沉淀管，在上升钻杆取下沉淀管后，把另一管子装上，立刻就可以继续钻进。这样，每天就增加了一两小时的钻进时间。马文志小组还想出了在取岩芯、下河砂时不停止钻进的办法。原来取岩芯、下河砂的时候，在四百公尺到五百公尺深度时，每次要停止钻进三十分钟左右，一天三次就要停止九十分钟左右的钻进时间。现在改为在钻进时就把河砂放下去，到砂子到达钻孔底部时才停止钻进，这样，每天的钻进时间就又增加了许多。
    他们学习了苏联的使用黄泥浆保护井壁的办法，保证了安全，节省了套管。过去钻进时，在岩芯管和井壁之间，需用圆形铁制的套管来保护井壁，防止小块岩石、岩粉的塌落。在使用了黄泥浆保护井壁的办法后，减小了水的冲激力，因而增加了对井壁压力的抵抗，减少了小块岩石岩粉的塌落。同时，泥浆还可把塌落的岩石岩粉托住不使下沉，减少了清扫井底的时间，并且避免了事故。另外，使用黄泥浆后，不但节省了大批套管，还节省了钻井完毕回收套管的时间。马文志小组在使用泥浆的过程中，已经初步摸到了经验，即：钻硬岩石时要少掺黄土，钻软岩石（尤其是页岩）时需要掺大量黄土。现在马文志小组已经创造了七百公尺深孔不下套管的纪录。（按：在使用黄泥浆时，须要注意在上升钻杆时用清水浇洗管子上沾的泥浆，以便检查管子的磨损情况。）
    在遇到砾岩和花岗岩时，必须使用铁砂钻头，并下铁砂子。马文志小组的经验证明，在这种情况下，加长铁砂钻头水口，多放铁砂，不但可以加长钻进时间，减少上下管时间，而且可以防止事故。为了多放铁砂，他们把钻头的水口由三十粍长改为九十点一五至二百粍2长。用铁砂量的多少，根据钻头大小而定。一百粍的钻头每次用三公斤，七十五粍的钻头每次用二公斤，五十五粍的钻头每次用一公斤。开始时，很多人都认为铁砂放多了会有“夹管”的危险，主张用一把铁砂就可以了。马文志小组打破了惯例。事实证明，铁砂放多了，就会把孔径磨粗，小的岩石块就夹不住钻杆了。同时，铁砂多了，消磨的时间长，也就增加了钻进时间。但在使用铁砂时，须要在岩芯管和钻头之间接一个“接钻头”（工人叫“接手”），以防止磨坏岩芯管的丝扣。现在，马文志小组已经可以在七百公尺的深孔中安全地使用铁砂钻头和铁砂了。
    马文志小组还注意了发挥水泵的效能。往井内灌注的水越多，钻进的速度越快，也越安全。过去钻探工人们不明白这个道理，仅仅使用了三分之二左右的水力，有三分之一的水白白扔掉了。马文志小组克服了障碍，百分之百地发挥了水泵的作用。
    马文志小组还改进了锋钢钻头。原来七十五粍的钻头上斜镶八块锋钢，现在改为两行平行斜镶十六块锋钢，因而增加了钻头耐久力和钻进力；试验结果，提高效率百分之三十以上。为了增加钻头的出水量，他们按照不同的岩层，采用了以下几种镶钻头的方法：钻软质页岩时，外口放大一点五到二糎，使接触面大，因而出水量也就大。钻砾岩层时，把钻石钢镶在中央，成为凸形，并且抢槎镶，这样进度既快又安全。钻黏板岩时，不割水口，把钻石钢高高镶着，使水从钻石钢下冲出，力量大进度快。
    马文志小组在管理上的改进
    马文志小组有一套严格的管理制度，这些制度是在自我批评和互相批评的政治生活中建立和巩固起来的。
    他们实行了专责制，加强了纪律性。马文志小组共二十二人（最近增加了六名正在培养的后备人员）。其中组长一人，负责行政领导和技术指导；下分日夜三班（二十四小时为一工作循环），每班五人，一人轮休，经常工作的是四个人。四个人有明确的分工。扶闸把的工作情况的好坏，是决定钻进快慢、岩芯正确与否以及能否保证安全工作的重要关键。过去大家乱扶，常妨碍工作。马文志小组由班长专门负责扶闸把。围绕着保证安全和快速钻进的一系列的检查工作，如搅拌泥浆、检查水龙头、检查岩粉、注意回水的情况、检查电动机的热度、检查大架横梁牵引钻具和整理工具等，都有一定人员负责。因此，他们一直没有发生过掉管子、埋管子及其他任何责任事故。
    马文志小组还订了四种制度：一、严格执行交接班制，加强各班间的配合。他们三个小班每天都早来十五分钟，晚走十五分钟，在这时间里，交班的人向接班的人介绍情况，或者帮助下班修理机械。他们交代的事情是井内情况、机器运转情况、材料工具、原始记录和岩芯数目等。二、严格执行检查制度。他们检查的项目有：岩芯记录、机器工具、上下管钻头钻杆的丝扣好坏、水量水纹及材料消耗等。三、建立每个小班的纪录图表制。纪录图表上面标明全小组以及每个小班应完成的效率、进度、质量及实际完成情况。这种办法激发了各个小组相互比赛的热情。四、每星期召开一次会议，检查工作，互相提意见。有紧急问题，随时开会商量。
    马文志小组虽然已经有了很大成就，并取得很多经验，但是目前还有一些困难，须要大力克服，如，遇到软岩石时应当设法同时使用两台水泵，在硬岩层须要使钻头能使用八小时以上等等。马文志小组也还有一个较重要的缺点，就是迁移和安装钻探设备所占的时间太多，影响钻探的总效率。另外，每工效率还远远落后于钻进的实际效率，因此，阜新矿务局和钻探队的领导方面应尽速协助他们克服困难、改正缺点，加速钻探工程的进展。马文志小组也应该戒骄戒躁，努力钻研业务，继续前进。（附图片）
