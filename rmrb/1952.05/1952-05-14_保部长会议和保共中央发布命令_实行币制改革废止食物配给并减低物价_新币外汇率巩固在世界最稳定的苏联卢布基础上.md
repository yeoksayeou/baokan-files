Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 13th: TASS reports: The Bulgarian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party issued an order on the 11th regarding currency reform, the abolition of food rationing, and the reduction of state retail prices. The order states that, due to the victorious development of the national economy in recent years, the unprecedented rise in industrial output, the increase in labor productivity, the victory in developing and reorganizing agriculture, and the completion of the procurement plans for grains and other agricultural products, the Party and government believe it is now possible to abolish rationing and allow all goods to be traded on a large scale according to unified retail prices.

The order points out that the currency reform guarantees the increase in the purchasing power of the Lev and consolidates the Lev's exchange rate on the basis of the world's most stable currency – the Soviet Ruble – freeing it from the constantly depreciating US dollar. The exchange rate of the Lev is set at one Lev and seventy stotinki for one Soviet Ruble. Currency exchange will be completed within four days, from May 12th to May 15th. Old Levs will be exchanged for new Levs at a rate of one hundred to one, regardless of the amount. Wages and other remuneration for labor and services, as well as pensions, subsidies, and other similar payments, will be converted at a rate of one hundred to four. Public bonds issued previously, savings in savings banks and current deposits, accounts of private commercial and industrial enterprises in lending institutions, accounts frozen during the period of nationalization, etc., will also be converted.

The rationing system will be completely abolished. From May 12, 1952, the rationing of bread, flour, pasta, rice, vegetable oil, fat, meat, fish, etc., will be cancelled. Sales will be made at unified state retail prices. Unified state retail prices are set by reducing non-rationed prices by 6% to 50%. Among them, the price of bread is reduced by 35%, rice by 50%, vegetable oil by 38%, etc. With the abolition of food rationing, the monthly salaries of workers and staff will be increased by 1,300 to 2,400 Levs (old currency) from May 10th. Pensions and student subsidies will also be increased.

    保部长会议和保共中央发布命令
    实行币制改革废止食物配给并减低物价
    新币外汇率巩固在世界最稳定的苏联卢布基础上
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚部长会议和保加利亚共产党中央委员会在十一日发表关于币制改革、废止食物配给及减低国营零售价格的命令说：由于几年来国民经济的胜利发展、工业产量的空前上升、劳动生产率的提高、发展与改组农业的胜利、谷类与其他农业产品收购计划的完成，党和政府认为已可能废止配给，并使所有物品得以根据统一零售价格进行大规模的贸易。
    命令指出：币制改革保证了利瓦购买力的提高，并把利瓦的外汇率巩固在世界最稳定的货币——苏联卢布的基础上，摆脱不断贬值的美元。利瓦的外汇率定为一利瓦七十斯托丁基换一苏联卢布。货币兑换在五月十二日到十五日的四天内办理完毕。旧利瓦兑换新利瓦不拘数量多少，其比率为一百对
    一。工资及其他劳动和服务的报酬，以及抚恤金、补助费和其他类似的付款，其折合率为一百对四。以前发行的公债、储蓄银行的储蓄金和活期存款、私营商业和工业企业在贷款机构内的账目，实行国有化期间所冻结的账目等等也加以折算。
    配给制将全部废除，从一九五二年五月十二日起，取消面包、面粉、通心粉、大米、植物油、脂肪、肉类、鱼等等的配给制。以统一的国营零售价格出售。统一国营零售价格是将非配给价格减低百分之六到百分之五十而制定的，其中，面包价格减低百分之三十五、大米减低百分之五十、植物油减低百分之三十八等等。随着食物配给制的废止，工人与职员的月薪自五月十日起增加了一千三百至二千四百利瓦（旧币）。抚恤金与学生补助费也予增加。
