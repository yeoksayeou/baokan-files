Workers of the No. 611 Textile Factory Power Plant
Victoriously Complete Boiler Renovation Task

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are the workers of the power plant of the No. 611 Textile Factory of the Southwest Industrial Department. We have gloriously fulfilled our promise to you, completing the installation and ignition of the new boiler on International Labor Day, May 1st. These two boilers originally belonged to Factory 102 and had a heat-receiving area of 500 square meters. They were destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries with yellow explosives before liberation. In January 1951, the higher authorities allocated these two boilers to our factory for use. We drew 25 workers and spent 53 days safely dismantling them, completing the renovation task 37 days ahead of schedule. Last April, under conditions of manpower and material difficulties, we drew 13 people to form a basic construction team to begin the renovation work. Apart from a two-and-a-half-month delay due to material supply and foundation surveying, and a one-and-a-half-month delay due to the major overhaul in June, the basic construction team put forward 25 major rationalization proposals in 280 days, overcame many difficulties, and enabled the boiler to be ignited today. We held a grand ignition ceremony on the afternoon of April 30 to celebrate our victory. This is our gift to International Labor Day, May 1st. We use this practical action to oppose the towering crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare.

    六一一纺纱厂发电所工人
    胜利完成装修锅炉的任务
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是西南工业部六一一纺纱厂发电所的工人。我们光荣地实现了向您的保证，在“五一”国际劳动节那天把新锅炉装建完工升火。这两座锅炉原是一○二厂的，受热面积有五百平方公尺，解放前被国民党反动派用黄色炸药炸毁了。一九五一年一月，上级把这两座锅炉调拨给我厂使用。我们抽调了二十五个工人，花了五十三天的时间，把它们安全地拆卸下来，提前三十七天完成装修任务。去年四月，在人力物力困难的条件下，我们抽了十三个人组织成一个基本建设小组，开始作装修工作。除了中途因材料供应和勘测地基延误了两个半月，及因六月份大检修延误了一个半月外，基本建设小组在二百八十天的时间内，提出了二十五件大的合理化建议，克服了许多困难，使锅炉得以在今天生火。我们在四月三十日下午举行了隆重的升火典礼，庆祝我们的胜利。这就是我们对“五一”国际劳动节的献礼。我们用这一实际行动来反对美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    六一一纺纱厂发电所全体工人
