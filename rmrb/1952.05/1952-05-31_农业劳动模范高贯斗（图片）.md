    Agricultural Labor Model Gao Guandou
    By Li Hua and Yu Xuexin
    X. This spring, the government called for a patriotic production increase campaign. Gao Guandou led seven mutual aid teams to formulate plans to increase per-unit-area yield, and initiated a friendly challenge to Shanxi labor model Li Shunda.
    XI. After the plan was made, there was a drought. He led ninety-six mutual aid teams in the village to organize more than eighty waterwheels and launched a "defeat the drought, sow on time, and ensure a bumper harvest" campaign. After five days of intensive planting, more than 700 mu of cotton were planted, successfully completing the drought-resistant sowing task.
    XII. In May, cotton plants suffered from aphids and spider mites. Gao Guandou immediately convened a meeting of experienced farmers to mobilize everyone and break the paralyzing idea that "it doesn't matter if we treat them or not." After the meeting, he led the villagers, using the rotenone powder and sprayers awarded to him by the government, as well as homemade bamboo tube sprayers, to kill the aphids. In less than a few days, all the cotton aphids and spider mites in the village's 1,600 mu of cotton fields were eliminated.

    农业劳动模范高贯斗
    李桦　于学信作
    十、今年春天，政府号召开展爱国丰产运动。高贯斗领导七个互助组订出了提高单位面积产量的增产计划，并向山西劳动模范李顺达作友谊的应战。
    十一、计划订好以后，天旱不雨。他就领导全村九十六个互助组组织了八十多辆水车，开展了“战胜旱灾，按时播种，保证丰产”的运动。经过五天的抢种，光棉花就点种了七百多亩，胜利地完成了抗旱播种的任务。
    十二、五月里，棉花生了蚜虫和红蜘蛛。高贯斗马上召集种地有经验的农民开会，动员大家，打破“治不治不要紧”的麻痹思想。会后，他领导全村农民拿着政府奖给他的鱼藤粉、喷雾器和土制的竹筒喷雾器，扑杀蚜虫。不到几天，全村一千六百多亩棉田中的棉蚜和红蜘蛛全部被消灭了。
