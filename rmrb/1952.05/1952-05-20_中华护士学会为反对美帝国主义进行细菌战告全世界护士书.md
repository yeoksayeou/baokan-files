Dear nurses from all countries,

The Chinese Nursing Association, representing the fervent hearts of all Chinese nurses, extends its highest regards and respect to you who are working hard for the health of mankind. We, the Chinese people, who constitute a quarter of the world's population, have shaken off the iron heels of imperialism and the shackles of feudalism and stood up strong. In the two years since the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, millions of hungry and cold farmers have been allocated land and improved their lives through the land reform movement, and millions of workers struggling in dark factories and mines have gained happy and pleasant lives under democratic reform. Our health workers have also freed themselves from the influence of imperialist medical and cultural aggression against our country in the ideological remolding movement. These great movements have brought us into close contact with the working masses and have added more glorious significance to our work.

The extremely shameless and brutal American imperialists are unwilling to see the liberation and freedom of the people of other countries. After the US government launched the criminal war of aggression against Korea in 1950, it disregarded repeated warnings from the Chinese people and madly directed its troops to cross the 38th parallel, burning the flames of war to the Yalu River and bombing Northeast China with its air force. The Chinese people, who have long suffered from the disasters of imperialist aggression, cannot sit idly by and tolerate this. In order to defend our motherland and to assist our close neighbor Korea, we Chinese people are determined to resist US aggression and aid Korea, organizing the Chinese People's Volunteers to enter Korea and fight alongside the Korean people against American aggression in order to defend peace in the Far East and the world. However, after the American aggressors suffered a shameful defeat in the face of the righteous Chinese and Korean People's Armies, they not only did not stop the war of aggression against Korea, but instead went berserk and launched the most cruel and shameful germ warfare in human history in January 1952. According to incomplete statistics as of March 31, the American aggressors dropped insects and various poisons in Korea a total of 804 times. The American aggressors also spread insects carrying germs and viruses in Northeast China and other places within our country. The germ warfare waged by the American aggressors has been verified by on-the-spot investigations by the investigation team dispatched by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the "Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by American Imperialism" organized by the Chinese people; and there are also irrefutable evidences such as the confessions, broadcasts, and open letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers from American air force prisoners of war Inak and Quinn who personally dropped germ bombs. This is an ironclad criminal fact that the American imperialists cannot deny.

Dear nurses from all countries, we who are engaged in health care are working together to protect human health and eliminate bacteria, and of course we cannot tolerate the towering crime of the American aggressors who spread bacteria to exterminate humanity. In order to defend world justice and peace, and to oppose the germ warfare of American imperialists, many health workers are working selflessly on the front lines in Korea. We want to urgently appeal to nurses sisters and brothers all over the world: demand that you lodge serious protests against the public enemy of manufacturing germ warfare, destroying human justice and undermining world peace – the American aggressors. Dear nurses from all countries, let us hold hands tightly! Under the shining light of humanitarianism, for the sake of defending peace and upholding justice, let us fight to the end against the inhuman, germ warfare criminal American imperialist germ warfare criminals!

    中华护士学会为反对美帝国主义进行细菌战告全世界护士书
    亲爱的各国护士同志们：
    中华护士学会代表全中国护士们火热的心，向为人类健康而辛苦奋斗的您们致以最崇高的关怀和敬意。我们占全世界四分之一人口的中国人民，已摆脱帝国主义铁蹄的蹂躏和封建主义枷锁的压迫而坚强地站起来了。一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立以来两年多时间中，千千万万饥寒交迫的农民从土地改革运动中分得了土地，改善了生活，千百万在黑暗厂矿中挣扎的工人在民主改革下得到了幸福和愉快的生活，我们卫生工作者也在思想改造运动中摆脱了帝国主义对我国医学文化侵略的影响。这许多伟大的运动，使我们和劳动大众紧密地联系起来了，使我们的工作更增加了光辉的意义。
    极端无耻的残暴的美帝国主义者是不甘心别国人民的解放和自由的。美国政府在一九五零年发动侵略朝鲜罪恶战争后，不顾中国人民屡次警告，疯狂地指使其军队越过“三八”线，将战火烧到鸭绿江边并以空军轰炸我国东北。曾经长期经受帝国主义侵略灾难的中国人民，对此决不能坐视和容忍。为了保卫自己的祖国，为了援助唇齿相依的邻邦朝鲜，我们中国人民决心起来抗美援朝，组织中国人民志愿军进入朝鲜，与朝鲜人民并肩反抗美国侵略，以保卫远东和世界的和平。但美国侵略者在为正义而战的中朝人民军队面前遭到了可耻的失败以后，不但不停止侵朝战争，反而狗急跳墙，在一九五二年一月发动人类历史上最残酷最可耻的细菌战。截至三月三十一日止的不完全统计，美国侵略者在朝鲜投掷昆虫和各种毒物共达八百零四次。而对我国境内，美国侵略者亦在东北等地撒布带有病菌病毒的昆虫。美国侵略者进行细菌战，已由国际民主法律工作者协会所派遣的调查团和我国人民所组织的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”实地调查属实；并且已有亲手投掷细菌弹的美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩两人的供词、广播词和给中国人民志愿军的公开信作为不可辩驳的对证。这是铁证如山的罪恶事实，美帝国主义者是狡赖不了的。
    亲爱的各国护士同志们，我们从事卫生保健事业的工作者，是以保护人类健康、消灭细菌为共同奋斗目标的，当然更加不能容忍美国侵略者这种灭绝人性撒布细菌的滔天罪行。为了保卫世界正义与和平，为了反对美帝国主义者的细菌战，有很多卫生工作者正在朝鲜前线忘我地工作着。我们要向全世界的护士姊妹兄弟们紧急呼吁：要求您们对于制造细菌战争、毁灭人类正义和破坏世界和平的公敌——美国侵略者提出严重抗议。亲爱的各国护士同志们，让我们紧密地握起手来吧！在人道主义光辉的照耀下，为保卫和平，维护正义，向灭绝人性、制造细菌战的美帝国主义细菌战犯斗争到底！
