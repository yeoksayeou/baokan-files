	"Five-Antis" Briefs
	▲ The third phase of the "Five-Antis" movement in Guangzhou began on the 7th. The work in the third phase is to continue handling the law-abiding, basically law-abiding, and half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking industrial and commercial households in various industries, and this phase will quickly and thoroughly complete the handling of these three types of industrial and commercial households. At the same time, fierce struggles will be launched against the key households that have become increasingly isolated, in order to strive for the basic completion of the "Five-Antis" movement.
	▲ Chongqing has completed the processing of the first three categories of industrial and commercial households in April. These industrial and commercial households that have been treated with leniency are actively developing their businesses and changing their past bad business styles. In order to encourage this group of capitalists who have been dealt with to actively operate, workers and shop assistants have taken the initiative to hold labor-capital symposiums, labor-capital consultation meetings, etc., to help dispel the concerns of the capitalists and discuss future business plans. In April, more than 270 manufacturers and state-owned enterprises signed processing and ordering contracts through the Chongqing Trust Company. Many industrial and commercial households in various industries have automatically increased their capital and expanded their businesses.

    “五反”简讯
    ▲广州市“五反”运动第三期工作已于七日开始。第三期的工作是继续处理各行业的守法、基本守法和半守法半违法三类工商户，在这一期要将这三类工商户迅速而彻底地处理完毕。同时对于已经日益孤立的重点户将展开激烈的斗争，以争取“五反”运动的基本完成。
    ▲重庆市前三类工商户在四月份已全部处理完毕。这些受到宽大处理的工商户都积极开展业务，改变过去不良的经营作风。为鼓励这批已处理的资本家积极经营，工人店员曾主动举行劳资座谈会、劳资协商会等，帮助解除资方的顾虑，并商讨今后开展业务计划。四月份内，全市工商户经重庆市信托公司介绍，已有二百七十多家厂商和国营企业部门签订了加工定货合同。各行业有不少工商户自动增加资金，扩大业务。
