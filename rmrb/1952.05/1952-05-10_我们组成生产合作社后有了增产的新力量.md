    We Have New Strength for Increased Production After Forming a Producers' Cooperative
    Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Our labor is respected. We will no longer be looked down upon like beasts of burden, as we were in the old society. After liberation, we organized mutual aid teams and received government awards every year. Last year, only four people in our entire team did not receive medals; the county and district awarded more than thirty people, and the province awarded seven people. This year is even more different from previous years; the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has also awarded us; we are simply overjoyed and don't know what to say! Chairman Mao has given us honor, and our enthusiasm for production has increased even more.
    We working people are now masters of our own lives. This is only possible in a country led by Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the working class. Just as we were enthusiastically building our happy life, the evil U.S. imperialism once approached our country's gates, and this year it is spreading bacteria, trying to destroy us. However, with Chairman Mao and the united working people, no matter what kind of poisonous insects U.S. imperialism spreads, it will not work; we have the strength to eliminate it. Last year, to defend our motherland and our new life, our Bao'an Village donated more than nine million yuan and actively participated in supporting the front lines. On the walls of every household, we posted: "We have money if you need money, we have people if you need people, we have carts and horses if you need carts and horses, whenever you need them, we will be there." The working people have infinite strength, and we will make our country have everything it needs. This year, in the increased production competition, we will further exert all our strength and use new and greater labor achievements to answer the American aggressors!
    We are responding to the call of the Central People's Government and are concentrating our efforts to fight for increased yield per unit area. This year, our average yield per hectare (equivalent to fifteen mu) is to reach 8,194 jin, an increase of 32.2 percent over last year's plan. Our production this year is even more different from previous years - the numbers are big, and our confidence is high. The yield per unit area of some crops is to increase by 50 percent compared to last year. But the cooperative members all say, "We guarantee to exceed it, we won't fail!" This is because we have accumulated four or five years of experience in organizing, and this year we have developed from mutual aid teams into agricultural production cooperatives. In the few months of production since forming the production cooperative, we have already seen a new possibility and new strength to ensure increased production.
    After land, labor, carts, and horses are contributed as shares, everyone can get more grain because the cooperative produces more, and the cooperative members are even more united. For example, the matter of applying more manure was not universally achievable in the mutual aid team. At that time, it was "my manure on my land." Those with more carts and horses had more good manure and could transport it to the fields in a timely manner; farmers lacking carts, horses, and manure could not do this. This year is completely different; cooperative members can get twenty to twenty-five jin of grain for each cart of manure they give to the cooperative. The cooperative takes as much manure as it can get, and the cooperative members are actively collecting manure. At least forty carts are applied per hectare, double the amount in the past. Strong members apply earth manure, and those without strength apply stable manure. Starting from March 8th, more than 1,600 carts of manure were delivered by May 1st. In addition to the manure accumulated by the cooperative members themselves, more than 70 carts of yellow manure and pig manure, 1,500 jin of fertilizer powder, 70 or 80 jin of perilla oil, and 50 or 60 jin of beef tallow were purchased from the city. In addition to applying more manure fertilizer, the soil is also being improved, and black soil is being hauled to fifteen hectares of land; fifty carts of sand have already been hauled into the paddy fields. The cooperative members are working hard, with five rubber-tired carts hauling more than fifty carts of manure a day, and no one is absent from work. Doing one more unit of work earns one more unit of grain, and everyone is striving to exceed the prescribed labor days (prescribed at 240 labor days per year for agriculture and sideline occupations).
    After land and equipment are pooled, the effectiveness of the division of labour and specialisation has been enhanced. Division of labour and specialisation had already been implemented in the mutual aid joint groups, and had played a certain role in improving production, but there were still many problems that could not be solved. For example, when the agricultural team leader allocated work, strong labourers and those with good skills were willing to do their own work first; whoever weak labourers and women were allocated to, that household was not satisfied. No matter how the allocation was made, it was not appropriate. Professional division of labour such as ploughing and sowing could not always be fully realised. The leadership had difficulties, and the farmers themselves also had difficulties. After a person finished working in the fields, they had to come back to chop grass to feed the horses and also attend meetings, so they could not do everything. Only after the establishment of the co-operative can the role of division of labour and specialisation be really brought into play. Whatever labour is needed, that labour is sent, as many people as are needed are sent, and whatever part they can do, they do. Women and semi-able-bodied people can also play their part. For example, during the days of preparing for farming, every day as soon as we got up, we "took our places", the strong people dug manure, and the weak and women loaded carts. Those who repaired farm tools, made ropes, chopped grass, and went to town to buy manure were all busy going to their own jobs. On this basis, we organised
    "Individual competitions". The new farm implements, old farm implements and women's groups of the agricultural team have all set standards for each stage of work as conditions for individual competition challenges. For example, the new farm implements group fixed four people to hold the plough, and their competition conditions are: (1) The plough must be seven inches deep, and it must be ploughed evenly, with the same depth. (2) Plough five and a half to six mu of land per day. (3) Ensure that the plough does not rust, does not lose parts, and everything is packed at home, and no time is wasted in the field. Other work such as sowing and weeding has different specific conditions. The old farm implements group is the same. In addition to challenging the other two groups, each person in the women's group also challenged each other. When Wang Guilin and Niu Guizhi were scraping the stubble, they proposed: "The looting must be fast, the beating must be clean, and one person must have six ridges." The horse feeder said: "I guarantee to feed the horses fat and smooth." In short, everyone has enough confidence to complete their specialised task.
    After the land, labour force, carts and horses are pooled, we can better utilise the human and animal power. The land after the shareholding is connected into one piece, the new farm tools can give full play to their role, with the swing and the rake, the soil is loose and the ridges are straight, and the crops will certainly grow well. In the past, after ploughing for this family, we would plough for that family, and after three or four days, we would rake, and the soil blocks could not be raked open. Some people were even afraid of paying back the work and insisted on using their own cattle and plough to cultivate the land, and the small cattle could not swing, and after two days it rained again, missing the farming season.
    After the implementation of unified land management and the principle of distribution based on labour, labour morale has been unprecedentedly enhanced. In the past, if you were absent from work for two shifts, you would get two shifts of pay, and you would still get grain in the autumn, so you didn't care about being absent from work; now everyone is rushing to participate in labour. Women can also participate in labour as long as they can do one shift of work. Everyone's awareness has also been raised. For example, Xu Fengshan's family is just one person, and they have never done any work for the military dependants in the past, but now they automatically fetch water for the military dependants. He and Gao Fengming used to not attend meetings when they were working, but now they come as soon as they are called to meetings.
    This year, our mood is always indescribably happy. Niu Defang said: "Work happily, work for a few years, and it will be even better if we get tractors, we must catch up with socialism and live a happy life." All our co-operative members have this enthusiasm, and we must work hard to increase production, strengthen our country's economic and defence forces, and strive for the rapid industrialisation of the country.

    我们组成生产合作社后有了增产的新力量
    韩恩农业生产合作社
    我们的劳动受到了尊重。我们再不会像在旧社会时那样被人当牛马一样的卑视。解放以后，我们组织了互助组，每年都得到政府的奖励。去年我们全组就只有四个人没得到奖章；县区奖励了三十多人，省奖励了七人。今年更和往年不一样，中央人民政府农业部也奖励了我们；我们简直高兴得不知说什么好！毛主席给了我们光荣，我们生产的劲儿从此更大了。
    我们劳动人民，现在作了自己生活的主人。这只有在毛主席、共产党、工人阶级领导下的国家，才有可能。正当我们兴致勃勃地来建设自己的幸福生活的时候，万恶的美帝国主义，曾打近了我国的大门，今年又撒布细菌，想毁灭我们。可是，有毛主席，有团结起来的劳动人民，美帝国主义撒什么毒虫都不顶事，我们有力量消灭它。去年为了保卫祖国，保卫我们的新生活，我们保安屯曾捐献了九百多万元，并且积极参加了支援前线的行动。我们家家户户的墙上贴着：“要钱有钱，要人有人，要车马有车马，什么时候要，什么时候到。”劳动人民是有无穷的力量的，我们要让我们的国家，要什么有什么。今年我们在增产竞赛运动中，更要发挥一切力量，以新的更大的劳动成果，来回答美国侵略者！
    我们响应中央人民政府的号召，正集中力量为提高单位面积产量而斗争。今年我们每垧地（合十五市亩）平均产量要达到八千一百九十四斤，比去年的计划提高百分之三十二点二。我们今年的生产和往年更不相同了——数字大，信心高。有的作物单位面积产量要比去年提高百分之五十。但社员们都说：“保证超过，不会完不成！”这是因为我们已积累了四、五年的组织起来的经验，今年我们又由互助组发展成为农业生产合作社。在组成生产合作社后几个月的生产中，我们已经看到了保证增产的一种新的可能和新的力量。
    土地、劳力、车马入股以后，因为社里多增产，大家就可以多得粮，社员们更加一条心了。比如多上粪这件事，在互助组时，并不是普遍都做得到的。那时，“我的粪上我的地”，车马多的，好粪多，也能及时往地里拉；缺车少马和粪肥少的农户，就作不到这一点。今年就完全不同了，社员给社里一车粪可以得二十到二十五斤粮食。有多少粪社里就要多少，社员都积极拾粪。每垧地至少可上四十车，比过去增加一倍。有劲的地上土粪，没劲的地上圈粪。从“三八”节开始送，到“五一”节送完一千六百多车粪。除社员个人积的送完外，还上城里买了七十多车黄粪、猪粪，一千五百斤肥田粉，七八十斤苏子油，五十多斤牛油。除了多上粪肥，还要改良土壤，正在往十五垧地里拉黑土；稻田已拉进五十车沙。社员是使劲儿干，五台胶皮车一天拉五十多车粪，谁也不旷工。多做一个工多得一个工的粮，大家都要争取超过规定的劳动日（规定一年农副业共二百四十个劳动日）。
    土地车马入股后，进一步发挥了分工分业的效能。在互助联组的时候已实行了分工分业，在提高生产上曾发挥了一定作用，但总还有许多解决不了的问题。如农业组长拨工时，强的劳动力、技术好的人，都愿先干自己的活；弱劳动力和妇女，拨给谁家，谁家不满意。怎么拨也不合适。扶犁、播种等专业分工，总是不能完全实现。领导有困难，农户自己也有困难。一个人干完地里活，回来还得铡草喂马，又要开会，干了这干不了那。成立合作社后，才真正发挥了分工分业的作用。那里要用什么工就去什么工，要多少人有多少人，能作几分作几分。妇女和半劳力也都能发挥他们的力量。比如我们在备耕的日子里，每天一起床，就“各就各位”，力气大的刨粪，力气弱的和妇女装车。修理农具的、打绳子的、铡草的、上街买粪的，都忙着走上自己的工作岗位。在这个基础上，我们就组织了
    “个人比赛”。农业组的新农具、旧农具、妇女三个小组，在每一个工作阶段里，都规定好标准，作为个人比赛挑战的条件。如新农具组固定四个人扶犁，他们的比赛条件是：（1）犁够七寸深，要犁得匀整，深浅一样。（2）每天犁五亩半到六亩地。（3）保证犁不生锈，不丢零件，一切在家收拾好，不准在地里耽误功夫。其他播种锄草等工作都有不同的具体条件。旧农具组也同样。妇女组除和其他两组挑战外，组内每个人又互相挑战。王桂琴和牛桂芝在刨茬子时提出：“掳得快，打得净，一人六条垅。”喂马的说：“我保证把马喂得肥胖溜光。”总之，每个人对完成自己的专门任务都有足够的信心。
    土地劳力车马入股以后，我们已能更好地发挥人力畜力的作用。入股土地连成一片，新农具可以充分发挥作用，随趟随耙，土松垅直，庄稼一定长得好。过去是给这家犁完接着给那家犁，隔三四天后才耙，土块就耙不开了。甚至有的人怕还工，硬要用自己的牛和犁种地，小牛趟不动，过两天又下了雨，误了农时。
    实行土地统一经营和以劳力为主的分配原则以后，劳动情绪空前提高，过去旷两个工顶多多出两个工钱，秋后照样打粮，误点工不太在乎；现在大家抢着参加劳动。妇女们只要能干一分工，也能参加劳动。大家的觉悟也提高了，如徐凤山一家就自己一个人，过去从来没有给军属作过活，现在自动给军属挑水。他和郜凤鸣，过去作工时不参加会，现在开会时一招呼就来了。
    今年我们的心情，不知怎么的总有说不出的愉快。牛德芳说：“痛痛快快的干，干上几年，来了拖拉机就更好了，要赶上社会主义过幸福的生活。”我们全体社员都有这个劲头，我们要努力增产，加强我国的经济力量和国防力量，争取国家迅速实现工业化。
