Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th: People here, when discussing Ridgway's departure for his home country, point out that, besides the other "talents" he displayed in Korea, Ridgway also demonstrated an astonishing ability to make money. A year ago, Ridgway and his family arrived in Japan with very little personal luggage; this time, in order to transport the property he had scavenged during his year in Tokyo as the so-called Supreme Commander of the United Nations Forces and the occupying forces in Japan to the airport, he used four military trucks, which transported it for two whole days from May 11th to 12th.

     李奇微从日本搜刮大量财物
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社东京十三日讯：这儿的人谈起李奇微启程回国的事时指出：李奇微除了在朝鲜所施展了的其他“才干”以外，还表现了有惊人的发财本领。一年前，李奇微和他的家属带了很少的私人行李来到日本；这次，为了把他在东京当了一年所谓联合国军及驻日占领军总司令所搜刮得来的财物运到飞机场去，用了四辆军用大卡车，从五月十一日到十二日整整运了两天。
