Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th - The US side has not made any responsible explanation for the serious incidents of the bloody massacre of our captured personnel on February 18th and March 13th. However, the commander of the US invading Korean troops, Li Qiwei, publicly stated on May 9th that he would "take all force" against our captured personnel to suppress the just actions taken by our captured personnel to resist the forced detention carried out by the other side under the guise of so-called "voluntary repatriation". At the Korean armistice talks delegation meeting today, our chief representative, General Nan Ri, under the command of the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, issued a serious warning to the other side regarding this behavior that our side absolutely cannot tolerate. The full text of General Nan Ri's speech is as follows:

"I am ordered by our commander to inform your side: During the period when our captured personnel are held by your side, your side has systematically adopted a series of barbaric methods to achieve your long-planned purpose of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. Your side's criminal acts carried out under the guise of so-called 'voluntary repatriation' have completely destroyed the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and violated the minimum standards of human behavior. The resistance of our captured personnel to your side's illegal and unjust behavior is completely justified. Your side's successive bloody suppressions of our captured personnel cannot shake the strong will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation. However, your side has not made a responsible explanation for the two bloody massacres of our captured personnel on February 18th and March 13th, and your commander publicly stated on May 9th that another massacre would be carried out on our unarmed captured personnel, which is intolerable. Your side should clearly know that protecting the safety of the prisoners of war held by the commanders of both sides and respecting their personal dignity are inescapable obligations of the commanders of both sides. Your side must bear full and absolute responsibility for the safety of our captured personnel."

    李奇微公然声称要用武力屠杀我被俘人员
    南日将军奉命向美方提严重警告
    要美方对我被俘人员的安全负完全责任
    【新华社开城十日电】美方对于二月十八日和三月十三日两次血腥屠杀我方被俘人员的严重事件，至今未作任何负责的交代，而美国侵朝军队总司令李奇微竟于五月九日公然声称，将对我方被俘人员
    “采取一切武力”，以镇压我方被俘人员为反抗对方在所谓“自愿遣返”名义下进行的强迫扣留所采取的正义行动。十日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军奉朝鲜人民军最高司令官与中国人民志愿军司令员之命，对于这种我方绝对不能容忍的行为，向对方提出严重警告。南日将军发言全文如下：“我奉我方司令官之命通知你方：在我方被俘人员被你方收容期间，你方有计划地采取一系列的野蛮办法来实现你方蓄意已久的强迫扣留我方被俘人员的目的，你方这种在所谓‘自愿遣返’名义下进行的罪恶行为，彻底破坏了日内瓦战俘公约，违反了人类行为的最低标准。我方被俘人员对于你方这种非法不义行为的反抗，完全是正当的。你方对我方被俘人员所进行的接二连三的血腥镇压，都不能动摇我方被俘人员要求遣返的坚强意志。但你方对二月十八日、三月十三日两次血腥屠杀我方被俘人员的事件还没有作过负责的交代，你方司令官竟于五月九日公然声称，要对手无寸铁的我方被俘人员施行又一次的屠杀，这是不能容忍的。你方应该清楚知道保护双方司令官收容下的战俘的安全，并尊重他们的人格，乃是双方司令官所不能逃避的义务。你方必须对我方被俘人员的安全负完全的绝对的责任。”
