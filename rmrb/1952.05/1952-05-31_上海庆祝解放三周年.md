Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 30th: Shanghai celebrated the third anniversary of its liberation on the 28th. On that day, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government specially invited representatives from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life, totaling more than 2,000 people, to hold a commemorative meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal People's Government. Mayor Chen Yi delivered an important speech at the meeting. He said, "Over the past three years, thanks to the continuous efforts of the people of Shanghai, Shanghai has transformed from a city dependent on imperialist economics for survival to a city that develops independently without relying on imperialist economics; it has transformed from a city serving imperialists and reactionary forces to a city serving the people and production. Shanghai has greatly eliminated the poisons left behind by imperialism and its running dogs and has begun to embark on a normal and healthy path of development." Chen Yi pointed out that the victorious struggle of the people of Shanghai over the past three years has proven a truth: the Chinese people, without relying on the strength of imperialism, can not only manage a large city like Shanghai, but also manage it well and transform it well; and in the future, they will definitely build it even better!

To celebrate the third anniversary of Shanghai's liberation, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government held a grand football demonstration match at the Hongkou Stadium on the afternoon of the 28th. Participating in the competition were teams from the People's Liberation Army, workers, students, and citizens. More than 25,000 people visited to watch. Chen Yi, Shu Tong, and others also attended.

On this day, people from all walks of life also carried out celebratory activities and offered condolences to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen. The Liberation Daily, Xinwen Daily, Dagong Daily, and Wenhui Daily all published commentaries congratulating the achievements of the people of Shanghai over the past three years. The Liberation Daily and Labor Daily also published commemorative pictorials. All government agencies, organizations, factories, schools, and shops throughout the city hung national flags to celebrate, and all parks were open for free all day.
