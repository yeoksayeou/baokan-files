    How to Strengthen the Training of Propagandists
    Li Weiguang

    Training propagandists is an important method to systematically improve their political level and working ability. It is also an important method to consolidate the Party's propaganda network and ensure the regular operation of propaganda work. Over the past year, the training of propagandists across the country has achieved great success. According to statistics from last December, the Northeast Region has trained more than 63,000 propagandists, accounting for 22.3 percent of the total number of propagandists in the Northeast Region; nearly 100,000 propagandists have been trained in Hebei Province, accounting for 30 percent of the province's total; Shanxi Province has trained more than 40,000 propagandists, accounting for 38 percent of the province's total; major cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, as well as some industrial and mining areas, have also held special training courses for propagandists. The ideological consciousness of the trained propagandists has improved significantly, and they have generally become the core of the propaganda network organization and the leaders of grassroots propaganda organizations. Facts have proven that the serious training of propagandists plays a huge role in consolidating and expanding the propaganda network and enlivening propaganda work. Currently, Party organizations in various localities have attached importance to further strengthening the training of propagandists and have formulated plans to train all propagandists once or more than half of them in 1952. For example, the Northeast Region plans to train 60 percent of all propagandists this year; the Central South Region plans to train half of all propagandists; and the East China Region plans to train all propagandists once. This is a major task for the propaganda network work in various localities this year. In order to strengthen the Party's propaganda work and promote the current large-scale production increase and economy practice campaign, we must firmly grasp the work of training propagandists and ensure its completion on schedule.

    We Must Regard Explaining Current Tasks as the Central Content of Training Propagandists

    The training of propagandists should focus on current tasks as the central content, while simultaneously conducting education on current events and policies, as well as the professional education of propagandists. The educational content for training propagandists in various parts of Shandong Province includes three aspects: (1) current events and political education (including education on the Communist Party and Communism); (2) education on current work tasks; and (3) professional education for propagandists (including the significance of establishing a propaganda network, the tasks and conditions of propagandists, how to be a propagandist, and the methods and experiences of propaganda work, etc.). Generally speaking, these three contents are suitable for the current requirements for training propagandists.

    In implementing the above training guidelines and adopting the above training content, many localities have gained experience. For example, when training rural propagandists, the focus is on developing agricultural production and carrying out patriotic production increase competitions. When explaining organization, socialist education is also carried out, and various current agricultural production policies are explained. Finally, it is explained how to revise patriotic covenants with mutual aid teams as units, how to organize newspaper reading groups, carry out field newspaper reading, exchange production experience, and improve political awareness, etc. The advantage of doing this is that it can closely link with reality, promote central work, and improve the ideological awareness and working ability of propagandists. Therefore, great results have been achieved in all places where propagandists are trained in this way.

    However, some localities either only explain some principles of the propaganda network itself and methods for carrying out propaganda work, with little connection to the current central tasks, forming a phenomenon where the training work is disconnected from the current central tasks, failing to better promote the progress of the central work; or they only explain practical work issues in the training, putting forward the slogan of "teach what you do," without paying attention to improving the ideological level and working ability of the propagandists, thus reducing the effectiveness of the training. These two deviations have occurred in the Northeast and other places, and attention should be paid to correcting them in the future.

    Train Propagandists Using Various Organizational Forms According to Specific Circumstances

    The organizational form of training propagandists can be determined according to the specific circumstances of the local area. The following organizational forms are often adopted in various localities.

    1. Training courses detached from production. This form can be adopted during the slack farming season in rural areas, and it is also suitable for major cities and major industrial and mining areas. It is generally appropriate for them to be organized by the prefectural committees, county committees, city committees, and district committees. (It is also possible to attach this type of training course to other Party schools and training courses.) In this type of training course, the main focus should be on absorbing the backbone elements of propagandists, such as branch secretaries, propaganda team leaders, model propagandists, etc. The training time should be half a month. Sheng County in Zhejiang Province held a training course for backbone propagandists last December, and the effect was very good.

    2. Part-time training courses without detachment from production. This form is suitable for the universal rotation training of rural propagandists, and it is also suitable for the part-time training of industrial and mining propagandists. Huimin area in Shandong Province once conducted mobile training for propagandists by the county Party committee in collaboration with the district committee, with one or several townships as units; Renqiu and other counties in Hebei Province conducted universal training for propagandists with the village of the propagandist teaching station as the unit, and with the village with the teaching station as the center. In cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, and Jinan, the district committees or enterprise Party committees seized the spare time in the morning and evening to train their affiliated propagandists. This training method is currently the most common and main way to train propagandists.

    3. Holding propagandist lectures. This is only suitable for city committees to hold in cities. The Dalian Municipal Party Committee used the conditions of urban concentration and convenient transportation to hold propagandist lectures. When holding this type of lecture, Party reporters give regular reports. This method also plays a huge role in improving the ideology and work of propagandists.

    In addition to the above three methods, various localities have also adopted some other training methods. For example, the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee simultaneously trained backbone elements among propagandists in training courses for worker activists, and added courses required by propagandists in the training courses of some enterprise Party committees. Many prefectural committees in Shandong also transferred propagandists to participate in Party training courses and county schools for study. These methods can be adopted by various localities as appropriate.

    Closely Link with Reality and Achieve "Learning by Doing"

    Training propagandists should proceed from reality and achieve "learning by doing." The specific practices in various localities are:

    1. Combining lecturing, discussion, and summary. Some basic investigations should be made into the ideological situation of the propagandists before the lecture. For example, after conducting a general ideological situation survey of propagandists in Huimin area, Shandong Province, it was learned that they
    "felt empty in their stomachs," "were afraid of propagating incorrectly," "were afraid of delaying production," and also had ideological styles of "complaining about the backwardness of the masses" and "coercive commands." Therefore, based on these ideological situations, the conditions and tasks of propagandists and how to be a good propagandist were explained, giving the propagandists a profound education. When lecturing based on the ideological situation of the propagandists, it is necessary to grasp the key points and explain them in depth; after the lecture, discussions should be organized carefully. Special attention should be paid to using the comparison of good and bad typical examples to illustrate the problem. For example, some counties in Xingtai area, Hebei Province, introduced some typical materials of the propaganda network in the lectures, allowing the trained propagandists to analyze various typical materials based on the spirit of the Central Committee's decision on establishing a propaganda network, and then the leadership made conclusions. This vivid and specific education method has a great effect on improving the ideological level of propagandists.

    2. Organizing model propagandists to make typical reports. The Renqiu County Party Committee in Hebei Province once organized female model propagandist Fu Datizuo to report on her propaganda methods and learning methods in a propaganda training class that was not detached from production, which greatly encouraged propagandists with low cultural levels and weak abilities, and increased their confidence in their work. The trained female propagandists all said:
    "When people first became propagandists, they were similar to us, but now they have become models for the whole county. We should learn from her!" This method of mass education of the masses can be widely promoted.

    3. Conducting group practice in training and learning by doing. For example, the Party General Branch Committee of the Dalian Chemical Factory used the students of the propaganda training class to establish reading groups, oral propaganda groups, and broadcasting stations in various workshops, enabling the students to use what they learned as they learned it. Renqiu County in Hebei Province adopted the method of lecturing in the evening, discussing in the afternoon, and doing internship propaganda during the day in part-time training, which was very popular among propagandists. This not only enriches the content of the training, but also checks the effectiveness of the training.

    4. Pay attention to rectifying the organization of propagandists in training. For example, some places in Shandong Province generally conducted a review of the trained propagandists, discovered bad elements mixed into the propaganda network, and immediately cleaned them up; and used this to educate everyone and raise vigilance. This experience deserves attention.

    5. Organize photo exhibitions, and make it possible for rural propagandists to see a movie and visit a factory during the training process. After visiting the factory, the trained propagandists in Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, eliminated their doubts about using machines to farm in the future, thus deepening their understanding of communism. During the training process, Sheng County and other places in Zhejiang organized photo exhibitions on the Marriage Law and showed slides and movies about Soviet collective farms, which also had a great educational effect on the propagandists.

    The Party Committee Must Strengthen Leadership Over This Work

    The Party committee must strengthen leadership over the training of propagandists. To this end, the following points should be achieved:

    1. Formulate a unified plan for training propagandists, clearly stipulating the purpose, requirements, content, time, and methods of the training. Different requirements should be put forward for the training of propagandists in new and old areas, general propagandists, and backbone propagandists.

    2. Equip stronger cadres and strengthen the leadership of the training class; necessary preparations should be made for the business teaching materials for training propagandists, and it is best to compile and print some materials of model propagandists or draw up a certain educational outline.

    3. Before holding the training class, a thorough investigation should be conducted on the typical materials of the good and bad work of the propagandists, as one of the bases for formulating the plan, and to enrich the content of the lecture.

    4. Do a good job in the ideological mobilization work of transferring and training propagandists, as well as the preparation of food, accommodation, and other preparations for the training class.

    5. After the propagandists have been trained, they should be specifically assigned work to consolidate the training results.

    Local experience proves that strengthening the Party committee's leadership over the training class is the key to doing a good job in training propagandists.

    怎样加强宣传员的训练工作
    李维光
    训练宣传员是有系统地提高宣传员的政治水平和工作能力的重要方法，也是巩固党的宣传网、保证宣传工作经常化的重要方法。一年来，全国各地的宣传员的训练工作，已经获得了很大的成绩。根据去年十二月的统计，东北区已训练了宣传员六万三千多人，占东北区宣传员总数的百分之二十二点三；河北省受训的宣传员已近十万人，占全省宣传员总数的百分之三十；山西省训练了宣传员四万多人，占全省宣传员总数的百分之三十八；上海、武汉、重庆、广州等大城市和一些工矿地区，也都专门举办过宣传员训练班。经过训练的宣传员，思想觉悟有了显著的提高，一般都成了宣传网组织的核心和基层宣传组织的领导者。事实证明，认真训练宣传员，对巩固和扩大宣传网，活跃宣传工作，都有着极大的作用。目前各地党的组织对进一步加强宣传员的训练工作，都已重视并订出了计划，准备在一九五二年内把宣传员普遍训练一次或训练二分之一以上。比如东北区计划在今年训练所有宣传员的百分之六十；中南区计划训练所有宣传员的二分之一；华东区计划把所有宣传员普遍训练一次。这是今年各地宣传网工作的一个重大任务。为了加强党的宣传工作，推动当前的大规模的增产节约运动，对于训练宣传员的工作必须抓紧进行，保证如期完成。
    必须把讲解当前任务当作训练宣传员的中心内容
    对宣传员的训练，应以当前任务为中心内容，同时进行时事政策和宣传员的业务教育。山东省各地训练宣传员的教育内容有三个：（一）时事、政治教育（包括关于共产党和共产主义的教育）；（二）当前工作任务的教育；（三）宣传员的业务教育（包括建立宣传网工作的意义、宣传员的任务和条件、怎样做一个宣传员、以及宣传工作的方式方法和经验等）。这三个内容一般来说，是适合于当前训练宣传员的要求的。
    在贯彻执行上述训练方针和采用上述训练内容时，很多地方已获得了经验。比如对农村宣传员进行训练时，就以发展农业生产开展爱国增产竞赛为中心内容，在讲解组织起来的时候，同时进行社会主义的教育，并说明当前农业生产中的各种政策；最后再讲明如何以互助组为单位修订爱国公约，怎样组织读报组，开展地头读报工作、交流生产经验、提高政治觉悟等等。这样作的好处是既能密切联系实际、推动中心工作，又可提高宣传员的思想觉悟和工作能力。因而凡是这样训练宣传员的地方，都收到了极大的效果。
    但也有些地方或者只讲解宣传网本身的一些道理和开展宣传工作的办法，对当前中心任务联系较少，形成训练工作和当前中心任务脱节的现象，不能更好地推动中心工作前进；或者在训练中只讲解实际工作问题，提出“做什么教什么”的口号，没有注意提高宣传员的思想水平和工作能力，因而也减低了训练的效果。这两种偏向在东北及其他各地都曾发生过，今后应该注意纠正。
    根据具体情况、运用各种组织形式训练宣传员
    训练宣传员的组织形式，可以根据当地具体情况来确定。下列的几种组织形式，是各地常常采用的。
    一、脱离生产的训练班。这种形式在农村的农闲期间可以采用，也适合于大城市和主要工矿区，一般以由地委、县委和市委、区委举办为宜。（把这种训练班附设于党的其他学校和训练班中也可。）在这种训练班中，主要应是吸收宣传员的骨干分子，如支部书记、宣传员小组长、模范宣传员等，训练时间以半个月为宜。浙江省嵊县在去年十二月就举办过一期宣传员骨干分子训练班，效果很好。
    二、不脱离生产的业余训练班。这种形式适合于普遍轮训农村宣传员，也适合于工、矿宣传员的业余训练。山东省惠民地区曾由党的县委协同分区委以一乡或数乡为单位对宣传员进行了流动训练；河北省任邱等县则以宣传员传授站的片村为单位，以设有传授站的村子为中心，对宣传员进行了普训。在沈阳、天津、济南等城市是以区委或企业党委为单位，抓紧早晚的业余时间，对所属宣传员进行训练的。这种训练方式是目前训练宣传员最普遍最主要的方式。
    三、举办宣传员讲座。这只适宜于城市的市委举办。旅大市委即利用了城市集中和交通方便的条件举办过宣传员讲座。在举办这种讲座时，由党的报告员定期作报告。这种方式对提高宣传员的思想和工作也有极大的作用。
    除了上述的三种方式外，各地还采用了其他的一些训练办法。比如青岛市委在工人积极分子训练班中同时训练宣传员中的骨干分子，并在一些企业党委的训练班中加添宣传员所需的课程。山东不少地委还抽调宣传员参加党训班和县学进行学习。这些办法各地都可酌情采用。
    密切联系实际，做到“边学边做”
    训练宣传员应该从实际出发，并做到“边学边做”。各地的具体做法是：
    一、讲授、讨论和总结相结合。授课前对宣传员的思想情况应作些基本的调查。如山东惠民地区对宣传员作了一般思想情况的调查以后，了解到他们
    “感觉肚子里空”，“怕宣传错了”，“怕耽误生产”，另外还存在着“埋怨群众落后”和“强迫命令”的思想作风等。于是根据这些思想情况，讲解了宣传员的条件和任务以及怎样做一个好宣传员，给了宣传员以深刻的教育。在根据宣传员的思想情况进行讲授时，要掌握重点，深入讲解；讲授后应认真组织讨论。特别要注意运用好坏典型例子的对比来说明问题。如河北省邢台专区有些县把宣传网的一些典型材料在讲授中加以介绍，让受训的宣传员根据中央关于建立宣传网的决定的精神，分析各个典型材料，然后由领导方面作出结论。这种生动具体的教育方法，对提高宣传员的思想水平有着很大的作用。
    二、组织模范宣传员作典型报告。河北省任邱县委在不脱离生产的宣传员训练班中，曾组织女模范宣传员傅大体作了关于她的宣传方法和学习方法的报告，结果大大地鼓舞了文化低、能力弱的宣传员，使他们提高了工作信心。受训的妇女宣传员都说：
    “人家开头当宣传员的时候，跟咱差不多，现在却成了全县的模范。咱们应当向她看齐！”这种群众教育群众的方法，可以普遍推广。
    三、在训练中进行分组实习，边学边做。如旅大市化学厂党的总支委，就运用宣传员训练班的学员在各车间建立了读报组、口头宣传组和广播站等组织，使学员们作到了随学随用。河北省任邱县在业余训练中采取晚上讲课、午后讨论、白天作实习宣传的办法，很受宣传员的欢迎。这样既丰富了训练的内容，又检查了训练的效果。
    四、在训练中注意整顿宣传员的组织。比如山东省有的地方对受训的宣传员普遍进行了审查工作，发现了混入宣传网的坏分子，当即加以清洗；并以此教育大家，提高警惕。这一经验值得加以注意。
    五、组织图片展览，并尽可能在训练过程中使农村宣传员看到一次电影和参观一次工厂。浙江省临海县受训的宣传员在参观工厂后，对将来使用机器种地的怀疑便消除了，因而加深了对共产主义的认识。浙江嵊县等地在训练过程中曾组织了有关婚姻法的图片展览，并放映了有关苏联集体农庄的幻灯、电影，对宣传员的教育作用也是很大的。
    党委必须加强对这一工作的领导
    党委对宣传员的训练工作，必须加强领导。为此，应该做到以下几点：
    一、订出统一训练宣传员的计划，明确规定训练的目的、要求、内容、时间和办法。对新区和老区宣传员、一般宣传员和骨干宣传员的训练应该提出不同的要求。
    二、配备较强的干部，加强训练班的领导；对训练宣传员的业务教材应该做必要的准备，最好能编印一些模范宣传员的材料或拟出一定的教育提纲来。
    三、在举办训练班以前，应深入调查宣传员工作好坏的典型材料，作为订计划的依据之一，并以之充实讲课的内容。
    四、做好调训宣传员的思想动员工作以及训练班的食、宿等准备工作。
    五、宣传员在受训以后，应具体地给他们布置工作，以巩固训练成果。
    各地经验证明，加强党委对训练班的领导，是做好宣传员训练工作的关键。
