    Launching the Full Load, Over-Axis, Five-Hundred Kilometer Movement
    Railway Workers Across the Country Express Enthusiastic Support
    Following the release of the “Decision on Launching the Full Load, Over-Axis, Five-Hundred Kilometer Movement” by the leading organs of the Ministry of Railways, railway workers across the country have enthusiastically responded. Leading cadres at all bureaus have attached great importance to it. As a result, the national average daily car mileage in the first half of May has increased from 410.5 kilometers in March to 430 kilometers, with the China Changchun Railway Administration reaching 476 kilometers. The number of locomotives achieving 500 kilometers per day nationwide has increased from 25.6% in March to 34.5%. The national total over-axis transport reached 123,520,000 ton-kilometers, an increase of 56% compared to March. The net vehicle load of the Tianjin Railway Administration has reached 29.4 tons. The development of the movement is much faster than before the decision.
    After receiving the decision to launch the full load, over-axis, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, all railway administrations convened special meetings to study and deploy specific methods and steps for carrying out the movement. In early May, the leading organs of the China Changchun Railway Administration issued a joint notice to organizations at all levels, calling on all employees to earnestly study and implement this decision. Subsequently, detailed discussions and arrangements were made at various meetings and the bureau's overall telephone conference regarding the organizational and technical measures for carrying out the movement. The Tianjin Railway Administration's Communist Party Committee convened an enlarged committee meeting on May 12 to discuss specific methods for carrying out the movement and summarized the experience of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau in exceeding 500 daily car kilometers for the entire month of April. A decision was also made at the meeting, requiring organizations at all levels of the bureau to immediately and conscientiously study and discuss the decision to launch the movement, formulate specific implementation plans for each unit, and launch the movement throughout the bureau starting from June 1. The Qiqihar, Jilin, Shanghai, and Zhengzhou Railway Administrations have also conducted studies, discussions, and deployments.
    Workers across the country have expressed firm confidence in this movement and are actively engaged in preparatory work. The crew members of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, a national locomotive banner, wrote to the People's Railway News, saying, "We unanimously believe that launching this movement is a concrete action by railway workers to respond to Chairman Mao's great call for increasing production and practicing economy, and we unanimously support it." The Sujiatun Locomotive Depot and Sujiatun Station have signed a liaison contract to ensure the smooth development of this movement. The Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway is also working to improve locomotive routing. They have already fixed nine pairs of locomotives running over 500 kilometers between Sujiatun and Siping. Dispatchers at the Bengbu Branch and locomotive crews at the Bengbu and Pukou Locomotive Depots have established a "three-way contact system" for locomotive crews when departing on duty (i.e., the crew contacts the dispatcher once when reporting for duty, once during the trip, and once after arriving at the destination), thus ensuring that the Bengbu and Pukou Locomotive Depots exceeded 500 daily car kilometers for seven consecutive days from May 1 to May 7.

    开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动
    全国各地铁路职工表示热烈响应
    【新华社二十日讯】铁道部领导机关发布“关于开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的决定”之后，全路职工热烈响应，各局领导干部都很重视，因而五月上半月全国平均日车公里已由三月份的四百一十点五公里提高到四百三十公里，其中中长铁路管理局已达到四百七十六公里；全国五百公里机车台数由三月份的百分之二十五点六增加到百分之三十四点五；全国超轴总计达一亿二千三百五十二万吨公里，较三月份增加百分之五十六；车辆净载重天津铁路管理局已达二十九点四吨。运动发展情形，较决定前大为迅速。
    各铁路管理局在接得开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的决定之后，都召开专门会议对开展运动的具体方法、步骤进行了研究和布置。中长铁路管理局领导机关在五月上旬即向各级组织发出联合通知，号召全局职工认真学习和贯彻这一决定；随后又在各种会议上及该局全局电话会议上对于开展运动的组织上的、技术上的措施进行了详尽的讨论和布置。天津铁路管理局的中共党委在五月十二日召开了党委扩大会议，讨论开展运动的具体方法，总结了天津铁路分局四月份全月超过五百日车公里的经验。会上并作出决定，要求该局各级组织立即认真学习讨论开展运动的决定，制定各单位具体执行计划，自六月一日起，在全局范围开展这一运动。齐齐哈尔、吉林、上海、郑州等管理局，也都进行了学习讨论和布置。
    全国各地职工对这一运动表示了坚强的信心，他们积极从事准备工作。全国机车旗帜毛泽东号包车组乘务员写信给人民铁道报说：“我们一致认为开展这个运动是铁路工人响应毛主席增产节约的伟大号召的具体行动，我们一致拥护。”苏家屯机务段和苏家屯车站为了保证这一运动顺利开展，订立了联系合同。中长路沈阳分局并着手改进机车交路，他们在苏家屯、四平间已经固定了九对机车跑五百公里以上的交路。蚌埠分局调度员和蚌埠、浦口两机务段机车乘务员订立了机车乘务员在出乘时的“三联制度”（即乘务员出勤时、中途乘务时、到达目的地后和调度员各联系一次），因而保证了蚌埠、浦口两机务段从五月一日到五月七日连续七天全段日车公里突破了五百公里。
