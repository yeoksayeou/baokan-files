Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 24th: The U.S. aggressors are mobilizing troops from the British Commonwealth Division involved in the Korean War to suppress our captured personnel. According to Reuters reports from Busan on May 23rd and Tokyo on May 24th:

	"British Commonwealth troops may be sent to Geoje Island to assist in attempts to restore control over the troubled prisoner-of-war situation." "Australian troops may be ordered to undertake prisoner-of-war camp duties." It was also stated that: "British troops heading to Geoje Island will include Canadian troops." At 15:15 on May 24th, the BBC broadcast and claimed: "British and Canadian troops have arrived on Geoje Island today." For a long time, the American murderers have been using large numbers of U.S. troops and the Lee Syngman's (Rhee) puppet army, and exploiting Chiang Kai-shek's gang special agents to persecute and massacre our captured personnel. However, the persecution and massacre have only made our captured personnel's just struggle for repatriation even more heroic, and intensified the condemnation of the U.S. aggressive army by people all over the world. In order to step up the frenzied suppression and attempt to make its allied countries share the guilt of bloody massacres, the U.S. side, in addition to transferring a large number of U.S. troops and tanks to the Geoje Island and Busan prisoner-of-war camps, has ordered the British Commonwealth troops under its control to participate in the atrocities. Observers here pointed out that this practice of the U.S. aggressors cannot conceal the fact that it is the main murderer, and at the same time, all countries that have been coerced cannot shirk their due responsibilities.

    美国侵略者调侵朝英加军前往巨济岛釜山参预暴行
    【新华社开城二十四日电】美国侵略者正在调动侵朝的英联邦师部队前往镇压我方被俘人员。据路透社釜山五月二十三日和东京五月二十四日电称：
    “英联邦军队可能被派至巨济岛，以协助对多事的战俘局势恢复控制的企图。”“澳大利亚军队可能受命担任战俘营的任务。”又称：“开赴巨济岛的英国军队将包括加拿大军队。”五月二十四日十五时一刻英国广播公司广播并声称：“英国和加拿大部队今天已到达巨济岛。”按美国杀人犯长时期以来，就使用大批美军与李伪军，并利用蒋匪帮特务迫害与屠杀我方被俘人员，但迫害与屠杀反而使我方被俘人员要求遣返的正义斗争愈发英勇，使全世界人民对美国侵略军的谴责愈发尖锐。为了加紧疯狂镇压，并企图使其同盟国家分担血腥屠杀的罪名，美方除增调大量美军与坦克前往巨济岛、釜山战俘营外，更命令在其控制下的英联邦部队去参预暴行。此地观察家指出，美国侵略者这种做法丝毫也不能掩盖它是主要杀人犯的事实，同时所有被胁从的国家也不能推卸其所应负的责任。
