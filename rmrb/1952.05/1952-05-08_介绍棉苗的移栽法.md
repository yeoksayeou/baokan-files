    Introducing Cotton Seedling Transplantation Method
    Editor: I would like to introduce a method of cotton seedling transplantation to everyone.

    Cotton seedling transplantation is a very important method to ensure full cotton emergence. In the past, the general public had the saying that "cotton seedlings cannot be transplanted to live," which is a conservative idea. To strive for a bumper cotton harvest, we must break this saying. After liberation, people in many areas have begun to create methods for transplanting cotton seedlings to fill in gaps. For example, Cheng Mingjie from Northeast Liang Village, Sanqiao District, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, transplanted cotton seedlings on three-tenths of an acre of land in 1949, and the cotton plants yielded no fewer cotton bolls than those directly sown. After the cotton seedlings emerge, we should often go to the cotton fields to check for any missing seedlings. If there are missing seedlings, we should quickly find ways to transplant seedlings to fill the gaps, so as not to suffer losses. Let's do the math: If each acre of cotton field has 4,000 seedlings, and one-fifth of the seedlings are missing, then 800 seedlings are missing per acre. If each seedling bears 20 bolls, then each acre will produce 16,000 fewer bolls. If, on average, 100 bolls yield one jin of seed cotton, then each acre will yield 160 jin less of seed cotton. The magnitude of the loss is imaginable!

    In order to remedy the above losses, cotton seedling transplantation is a very important task. The method of cotton seedling transplantation is very simple. The roots of cotton seedlings are relatively deep, so when transplanting, pay attention to transplanting with soil and be careful not to damage the roots. The transplantation should be carried out on cloudy days or in the afternoon, preferably during light rain, so that the survival rate will be higher. Before transplanting, moisten the roots of the selected cotton seedlings with water so that the soil particles around the roots become mud. Then, use a shovel to carefully dig out the soil and seedlings together within two or three inches around the seedling, and transplant them into the holes with missing seedlings. Cover with soil, pat the soil with the shovel a few times to ensure close contact between the soil and the roots, and finally pour
    a bowl of water to help the seedlings survive. Last year, many places invented various cotton seedling transplanting tools. If these scientific tools can be used to transplant seedlings, the survival rate of cotton seedling transplantation can be further improved. It is hoped that cadres and farmers in various regions will pay attention to this work and strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

    介绍棉苗的移栽法
    编辑同志：我向大家介绍一个棉苗的移栽法。
    棉苗移植是保证棉花全苗的一个很重要的方法。过去一般群众有“棉花栽不活”的说法，这是一种保守的思想。为了争取棉花丰收，我们要打破这种说法。解放后，许多地区的群众已经开始创造了棉花移植补苗的方法，如陕西长安县三桥区三乡东北梁村程明杰，在一九四九年栽活了三分地的棉花，比一般棉花也不少结棉桃。我们应该在棉花出土以后，常到棉田内去检查有无缺苗的现象；如果缺苗，就应赶快设法移苗补齐，以免遭受损失。我们可算一下账：每亩棉田以四千株苗计算，如果缺苗五分之一，每亩就缺苗八百株。每株要是结铃二十个，则每亩少结铃一万六千个。如平均每一百铃折籽棉一斤，则每亩就要少收籽棉一百六十斤，损失之大可以想见！
    为了补救上述损失，棉苗移植是一件很重要的事。棉苗移植的方法很简单，棉苗的根较深，移植时应注意连土移植，并注意不要碰伤根部。移植的时期，应选阴天或下午进行，最好是趁正落小雨的时候移栽，这样成活率就高。在移植前，要把选择好准备移栽的棉苗的根部用水浇好，使棉苗根部的土粒成为泥块状。这时，再用铲子，小心地把周围二三寸宽的土连幼苗一齐挖出，补栽在缺苗的穴内，埋上土，用铲拍两下，使土壤和根部密接，最后浇
    一碗水，就可以成活。去年不少地方发明了各种棉苗移植器，如能采用这种科学的器具移苗，更可提高棉苗移植的成活率，希望各地干部和农民群众重视这个工作，为今年棉花丰产而努力。
