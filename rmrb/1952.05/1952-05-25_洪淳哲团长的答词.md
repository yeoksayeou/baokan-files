Dear Leaders, Dear Comrades:
    First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Korean People's Delegation to China, to express our deepest gratitude to you, who have provided us with immense guidance and assistance during our work and who are hosting such a grand banquet today to bid us farewell!
    Since our delegation's visit to China, through more than four months of work, we have clearly seen the great new China, which is developing actively, and we have seen the high degree of creativity and new atmosphere demonstrated by the 500 million Chinese people on all fronts. We have indeed learned many things here.
    In particular, the splendid achievements and moving, vivid stories of the Chinese brothers on the front lines of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea have given the delegation immense gratitude. Especially, we were able to meet the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and received a warm welcome from the great Chinese people. This really makes us feel extremely excited and supremely honored! We will take the astonishingly developed face of the new China and the great strength of the 500 million brothers in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea back to Korea and convey it to the fighting Korean people and the People's Army, thereby further enhancing their confidence in victory and fighting will!
    We are determined to repay the Chinese people's noble kindness to us with more heroic struggles and striving for final victory!
    The friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Korea, forged with blood through a long revolutionary history, has been further consolidated and developed through this visit!
    Finally, please allow me, on behalf of all the comrades of the delegation, to propose a toast to the further unity, consolidation, and development of the friendship between China and Korea, to the good health of our dear benefactor, the great Chairman Mao, to the rapid recovery of the health of the Chinese People's Volunteers wounded and sick who are recuperating back home, and to the good health of the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the families of the martyrs!
