Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The British workers' delegation, which came to our country to participate in the "May Day" celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of its departure from China:

We, the British workers' delegation attending the 1952 "May Day" celebration in Beijing, would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for the rare opportunity to visit and travel through New China. We also thank the cadres, translators, receptionists, train staff, and many other workers in all aspects who organized and arranged our trip to China. We congratulate them on their excellent organizational skills, thank them for their patience, amiable attitude, and thoughtful hospitality to each member of our delegation. We are even more grateful to all the Chinese people for the grand reception and warm welcome we received wherever we went.

We have traveled to Beijing, Shenyang, Fushun, Nanjing, the Huai River Basin, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. We visited factories, mines, hospitals, schools, cultural palaces, rural areas, and the New China Industrial Exhibition, and gained many profound impressions. The strength and enthusiasm of the Chinese people, and their sincere support for the Chinese People's Government and their leader Mao Zedong, were particularly impressive. During our travels, we found many examples that clearly demonstrated the Chinese people's trust and support for their leaders, and their strong confidence in their future.

We remember a young farmer in a rural area of Northeast China pointing proudly to his new horse-drawn seeder and saying, "When we are proficient in driving this machine, we will drive tractors. At that time, we will be able to cultivate more land, increasing the area cultivated each day from forty mu to one hundred mu."

We remember meeting an old lady in Hangzhou who said with a smiling face that her life was better than ever before because of the good leadership of the Chinese People's Government. She proudly showed us her textbook and said, "I was illiterate before liberation, but now I am learning to read and write."

The impression of our visit to the Huai River project was unforgettable. On our way to visit, we saw countless wounds left to the Chinese people over many centuries by brutal feudal landlords and foreign invaders. When we arrived at the places where dams, canals, sluices, and gates were being built, we were amazed. Here, we saw millions of workers, men, women, old and young, working with high efficiency, singing as they worked. We saw how excellent organization was used to overcome the lack of modern machinery. All the workers were actively working, hoping to complete the project well. Here we discovered the true reason for the Chinese people's enthusiastic and firm support of their government.

For centuries, the Huai River brought floods, disasters, poverty, tears, and tragedy to the people of northern Jiangsu. The former rulers or governments never really wanted to prevent this disaster, but here we saw that the Chinese People's Government, having been established for less than a year, was implementing a huge plan, not only to control the Huai River but also to make it suitable for irrigation and power generation, benefiting millions of people. Here we can see that the old suffering, poverty, tears, and tragedy have been transformed into the prosperity, joy, and happiness of millions of people living on both banks of the Huai River. The Huai River project is a noble humanitarian undertaking and a solid pillar of the socialist society that is being built in China. Undoubtedly, there is an indestructible link between the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Government, and their leader.

Wherever we went, whether in large or small cities and villages, we were always warmly welcomed. We will never forget the happy and cheerful smiles of the thousands of children we saw. It is because we want Chinese children and children all over the world to live happy and carefree lives that we must work hard to prevent new wars from happening.

The many constructions since the founding of the People's Republic of China have left a deep impression on us. Workers' residences, offices, hospitals, and cultural palaces have all been built since liberation. This is in stark contrast to the situation in our country, where the huge cost of rearmament has greatly reduced social, educational, and health services.

We visited the exhibition on germ warfare in Korea and China, and we saw evidence that convincingly proves that the Americans are committing the most horrific crimes imaginable against all of humanity. In addition to this evidence, we also heard recordings of speeches by captured American aviators. These all detailed the systematic and planned germ warfare conducted by the United States, and this germ warfare was carried out in the name of the United Nations. Those responsible for these horrific crimes are the enemies of all progressive humanity.

In speeches, in newspapers, and in the general conversations of all the Chinese people we met, we noticed their expression of a desire for peace.

We want to tell the British people about the excellent work of the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea. We will do everything we can to strive for the British people to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, to demand an end to the Korean War, and to force the British government to break away from the imperialist aggressive plans of the American ruling class.

We are convinced that, according to what we have seen and the reports we have received, all the Chinese people fervently desire peace.

We are also convinced that the Chinese People's Government is laying the foundation for a true socialist society, and that soon the Chinese people will reap abundant rewards from the struggles, trials, and tribulations they have experienced in winning their liberation.

We bid farewell to the Chinese people with deep feelings. We came to China as friends, but we have been accepted into the Chinese family. When the British working class fully understands the actual situation in China, no British government will dare to participate in a war of aggression against the Chinese people. We will certainly convey all the actual situations we have seen in China to the British workers.

We pledge to work to promote Anglo-Chinese friendship and to establish diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.

We pledge to do everything we can to establish world peace.

Long live the new People's Republic of China!

### 来我国参加“五一”节观礼的英国工人代表团  发表书面谈话向我国人民告别

    来我国参加“五一”节观礼的英国工人代表团
    发表书面谈话向我国人民告别
    【新华社二十三日讯】来我国参加“五一”节观礼的英国工人代表团，在离开中国的前夕，发表书面谈话如下：
    我们来北京参加一九五二年“五一”节庆祝典礼的英国工人代表团，能有难逢的机会访问并游历了新中国，特向中华全国总工会致衷心的谢意。我们也感谢各方面的干部、翻译人员、招待人员、火车上的工作人员，以及许多其他的工人，他们为我们组织并布置了旅行中国的事宜。我们对他们卓越的组织能力表示庆贺，感谢他们的耐心，和霭的态度，以及对我们代表团每一个人的周到的招待，我们更感谢全体中国人民，无论我们走到那里，都受到他们盛大的接待和亲热的欢迎。
    我们曾游历了北京、沈阳、抚顺、南京、淮河流域、扬州、镇江、杭州与上海。我们参观了工厂、矿山、医院、学校、文化宫、农村和新中国工业展览会，获得了许多深刻的印象。对中国人民的力量、热忱以及他们对中国人民政府和自己的领袖毛泽东所表现出来的真诚的拥戴，印象尤其深刻。我们在旅行中发现不少事例，明显地说明中国人民对他们领袖的信赖和拥戴，和对自己前途的坚强的信心。
    我们记得东北一个农村的青年农民非常骄傲地指着他的新的马拉的播种机说：“当我们能熟练地驾驶这架机器之后，我们将会驾驶拖拉机了；那时节我们就能多种地，每天耕种面积可以从四十亩增加到一百亩。”
    我们记得在杭州偶然遇到一位老太太，她满面笑容地说，由于中国人民政府领导得好，她的日子比以往任何时候都过得好。她骄傲地把她的课本给我们看，并且说：“解放前我是文盲，现在我在学习读和写了。”
    我们参观淮河工程的印象是令人难忘的。我们在去参观的时候，看到许多世纪来残暴的封建地主和外国侵略者所遗留给中国人民的无数创伤。当我们到了建筑堤坝、运河、水闸和闸门的地方，我们不禁惊愕了。在这里，我们看见千百万的工人，男女老少，以高度的效率在工作着，并且一面作工一面唱歌。我们见到如何以优良的组织来克服缺乏现代机器设备的困难。所有的工人都积极工作，希望很好地完成工程。我们在这里发现了中国人民热诚地坚定地拥护自己政府的真正原因。
    多少世纪来，淮河给苏北人民带来水患、灾难、贫困、眼泪和悲剧。从前的统治者或政府从来没有想要真正防止这种灾难，然而在这里，我们见到中国人民政府成立还不及一年，就来实行了一个巨大的计划，不仅要控制淮河，而且要使它适于灌溉和发电的需要，惠及千百万人民。我们在这里可以看到旧时的苦难、贫困、眼泪和悲剧已经改变为住在淮河两岸千百万人民的繁荣、喜悦与幸福。淮河工程是一个人道主义的崇高事业，也是正在中国建设的社会主义社会基础的一个坚固的柱石。无疑的，中国人民与中国人民政府和领袖之间有不可摧毁的联系。
    无论我们走到何处，无论在大小城市和乡村，我们总是受到衷心的欢迎。对我们所见到的数以千计的孩子们高兴愉快的笑容，我们将永志不忘。就是因为我们要使中国儿童与全世界儿童过着快乐的无拘无束的生活，我们要努力使新的战争不致发生。
    中华人民共和国成立以来的许多建设，给我们的印象颇为深刻。工人住宅、办公室、医院、文化宫，在解放后都已经建立起来了。这与我们国家的情况恰相反，在那里，重整军备的巨大费用已经大大缩减了社会、教育和卫生事业。
    我们参观了关于在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的展览会，我们看到了证据，令人信服地证明美国人在犯着最骇人的罪恶，可以想像到，这是反对全人类的。除了这些证据，我们还听了被俘的美国航空员讲话的录音。这都详细地揭露了美国有步骤有计划地进行细菌战，而这细菌战是在联合国名义下进行的。对这些恐怖的罪恶要负责的人们是全世界进步人类的敌人。
    在讲话中、报纸上、以及在我们会到的所有中国人民的一般交谈中，我们留意到他们表示出对和平的渴望。
    我们要把中国人民抗美援朝总会优良的工作告诉英国人民。我们要尽一切力量，努力争取英国人民要求缔结五大国和平公约，要求停止朝鲜战争，迫使英国政府摆脱美国统治阶级的帝国主义的侵略计划。
    我们确信，据我们所见到的和所收到的报告，全中国人民都热望和平。
    我们也确信，中国人民政府在为真正的社会主义社会奠定基础，不久中国人民就会从他们在赢得解放中所经历的斗争、磨炼和苦难中得到丰盛的收获。
    我们以深厚的心情向中国人民告别了。我们以朋友的资格来到中国，但是已经被接纳在中国的大家庭中了。当英国工人阶级能充分了解中国的实际情况时，就没有任何英国政府敢参与反对中国人民的侵略战争了。我们一定把在中国所见到的实际情况，全部传达给英国工人们。
    我们保证为增进英中友谊、为建立两国外交与贸易关系而努力。
    我们保证在确立世界和平上竭尽所能。
    新的中华人民共和国万岁！
