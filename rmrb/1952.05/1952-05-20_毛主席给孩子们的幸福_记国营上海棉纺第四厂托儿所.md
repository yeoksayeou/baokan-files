Chairman Mao Gives Happiness to the Children
——A Record of the Nursery of the State-Operated Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory

Walking into the gate of the State-Operated Shanghai No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, past the grape vines, roses, and a row of holly trees, one can see the newly built, beautiful nursery building. In the nursery rooms, the light green walls, light blue curtains, and smooth floors all give an impression of neatness and simplicity. The younger children sleep peacefully in light green cribs, their plump, red faces showing innocent smiles. The older children are playing with toy wooden horses, holding dolls… In the next room, porridge is being cooked, milk powder is being mixed; the nannies prepare different portions of different nutritional foods according to each child's age. Liver porridge, jujube porridge, tomato porridge… these are regular foods for children over six months old here.

The nursery has two floors, with a total of seventy beds. The upper floor is for children from newborn to ten months old, and the lower floor is for children from ten months to eighteen months old. There is a director, and eighteen nannies working day and night shifts, who have generally undergone training in the factory's nanny training class. There are also six cleaners who clean the premises.

Every day, when mothers bring their children to the nursery, feed them one last time before work, and hand them over to the nannies, the nannies carry out a series of hygiene procedures for the children: taking their temperature, checking their eyes, noses, and mouths…, and washing the children's faces with towels boiled in water. They regularly bathe the children, and in winter, they bathe them every five days. The doctor comes to visit at least once a day, paying special attention to the three most common illnesses children get: fever, diarrhea, and cough. If a child is sick, the nannies put a small flag indicating the illness on the crib and take extra care of the child. The children have now been vaccinated against smallpox and have received diphtheria and pertussis vaccinations. When the nannies hand the children back to their mothers, they always explain the child's condition for the day and tell the mothers what to pay attention to. When the mothers bring the children back the next day, they ask the mothers about the children's health. They keep a daily record of each child's life.

When feeding their babies, the mothers often talk to the nannies about the production situation in the workshops, reporting who has created new records, etc. The nannies then give the mothers general knowledge about maternal and infant care or read the newspaper to them.

One day, female worker Qiu Lanxi couldn't help but express her joy while feeding her baby, saying to the nanny, "Auntie, I'm really happy today, I've reached 30 looms!"
"Mom is so glorious!" the nanny praised.
Qiu Lanxi said, "This is all thanks to you, Auntie, for taking good care of the child. Otherwise, how could I be so focused on production? The glory should be yours!"
"This is all the glory that Chairman Mao has brought!" Everyone laughed happily.

Female worker Shang Miaoying in the fine yarn workshop hadn't had a child for many years. Not long after the nursery opened, she had a child, but the skin on her face had many wrinkles, and her legs were no thicker than an adult's thumb. Shang Miaoying was both happy and sad to see it. Her mother-in-law said, "Can this child even survive?" She said, "Let's try taking her to the nursery!" When weighed, she was only four and a half pounds. But this congenitally deficient infant grew from entering the nursery on October 29, 1950, to reaching fourteen pounds by April of the following year. Shang Miaoying was very happy, and she specially made a banner to send to the nursery, and also prepared to send a photo of the child to Chairman Mao. She said, "When I raised my older children six years ago, they were left at home without anyone to care for them. My mind was in the factory, but my heart was at home, just remembering whether the child was burned, hot, or cold. Now I only think about production." Female worker Lu Zhiying in the cloth weaving workshop did not have children, so she adopted a girl from the orphanage. The girl, who was just over two months old, still looked like a "kitten," with a layer of skin covering bones, and cried like a mosquito. When Lu Zhiying sent the child to the nursery, the nannies initially didn't dare to take her, but then they thought: We should do everything we can to keep her alive! The nannies put her in a small bed, her body was so small that she would fall through the gaps. When fed cod liver oil and milk powder, it would come out of her nose. Later, after the doctor's careful diagnosis and treatment, and the nannies' careful care, the child became stronger day by day, and now this child can run, is strong and lively.

During the reactionary rule, this nursery was only the size of a kitchen, with only four beds and no electric lights. One day, a female worker's child was sleeping in the nursery, and a rat climbed to the corner of the child's mouth to eat the leftover milk, and then climbed onto the child's nose and bit it. So the mothers were afraid when they saw this dark and gloomy little room. Wu Xiaobao, an investigator in the cloth weaving workshop, had five children, and the first four had died of neglect and poverty. Now this sixth child, after being cared for by the nursery, is growing up strong and lively. Wu Xiaobao happily said, "It would have been good if Shanghai had been liberated a few years earlier. Look how happy my child is now!" She kissed her child's little face: "Little one! This happiness is given by Chairman Mao!"

    毛主席给孩子们的幸福
    ——记国营上海棉纺第四厂托儿所
    葛娴
    走进国营上海棉纺第四厂厂门，经过紫葡萄架、月季花和一排冬青树，就可以看见一座新修的漂亮的托儿所的房子。在托儿所的房间里，浅绿色的墙，淡蓝色的窗帘，光滑的地板，一切设备都是整齐、朴素的。小的孩子们恬静地睡在浅绿色的小床里，丰润的红色小脸上露出天真的笑容。大些的孩子，有的玩小木马，有的抱小娃娃……隔壁的房里在煮着粥，调着奶粉，保育员按照每个孩子的不同月份给他们一定份量的不同的营养食品。猪肝粥、枣子粥、番茄粥……等在这里是六个月以上的孩子的经常食品。
    这个托儿所分楼上楼下两层，共有七十张床，楼上是初生到十个月的孩子，楼下是十个月以上到十八个月的孩子。这里有一个所长，日夜两班有十八个保育员，她们一般都经过了工厂保育员训练班的学习。其他还有六个清洁工人打扫卫生。
    每天当妈妈抱着孩子走进托儿所，喂好上工前的一次奶把孩子交给保育员以后，保育员就为孩子进行一系列的卫生工作：量温度，检查眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴……，用在开水里煮过的毛巾给孩子洗脸。她们经常给孩子们洗澡，在冬天每隔五天就要洗一次。医生每天至少来看一次，他特别注意孩子最容易生的发寒热、肚泻、咳嗽等三种病。那个孩子有了病，保育员就在床位上插上标志病情的小旗，特别小心看护。现在孩子们已经种了牛痘，打了白喉和百日咳的预防针。保育员们在把孩子交给他们的妈妈时，总要说明孩子一天来的情况，嘱咐妈妈应该注意的事项，到第二天妈妈送来时，她们又要向妈妈询问孩子的健康状况。她们每天都要作孩子的生活记录表。
    喂奶的时候，妈妈们常常向保育员们谈车间的生产情况，报告什么人创造了新纪录等等，保育员们就给妈妈们讲妇婴常识，或者读报给她们听。
    有一天，女工邱兰秀在喂奶时禁不住内心的喜欢，对保育员说：“阿姨，我今天真高兴，普通车挡上了三十台啦！”
    “妈妈真光荣！”保育员称赞说。
    邱兰秀说：“这都是你阿姨把孩子带得好呀，要不是，怎么能够安心生产呢？光荣该给你的！”
    “这都是毛主席带来的光荣呀！”大家都开心地笑了。
    细纱间女工尚妙英，好多年没生孩子了，这个托儿所开办不久后，她生了一个孩子，可是脸上的皮有很多皱纹，腿比大人的大拇指粗不了多少，尚妙英见了又喜欢又难过。她婆婆说：“这个孩子还能养得活吗？”她说：“带去托儿所试试吧！”一过磅，只有四磅半重。但是这个先天不足的婴儿从一九五○年十月二十九日进所到第二年四月就长到了十四磅了。尚妙英非常高兴，她特地做了一面锦旗送给托儿所，还准备把这个孩子的照片送给毛主席。她说：“六年前我养大孩子的时候，留在家里没人照管，我是人在工厂心在家，只记着孩子不要烫了吧，热了吧，冷了吧，现在我只想着搞生产了。”布机间女工卢志英没有孩子，到育婴堂抱了一个女孩。这个女孩两个多月了还活像只“小猫”，一层皮包着骨头，哭起来像蚊子叫。卢志英把这个孩子送到托儿所的时候，保育员开始不敢收，后来一想：应该尽一切力量来养活她！保育员把她放在小床上，身子小得会从空隙里掉下地去似的，给她吃鱼肝油、吃奶粉，就会从鼻子里流出来。后来经过医生细心的诊疗，经过保育员的细心调护，这个孩子一天比一天强壮起来，现在这个孩子已经会跑了，又结实又活泼。
    在反动派统治时期，这个托儿所只有灶披间那么大，里面只有四只床，没有电灯光。有一天，一个女工的孩子睡在托儿所里，老鼠爬在小孩的嘴角边吃余奶，以后就爬到孩子鼻子上，把鼻子咬坏了。所以妈妈们望见这个黑暗而阴沉的小屋子，就感到害怕。布机间调查工吴小宝，生了五个孩子，前四个都因为没人带、生活苦而折磨死了。如今这第六个孩子，经过托儿所的抚养，长得又强壮又活泼。吴小宝高兴得说：“上海早解放几年就好了，看我现在这孩子多幸福！”她亲亲她的孩子的小脸：“小囡呀！这幸福是毛主席给的！”
