Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Since January of this year, various parts of Burma have experienced continuous major fires. For example, Prome in western Burma, which suffered a fire last year, experienced another major fire in January, destroying more than 1,000 houses. Many overseas Chinese were left homeless. Pauktaw, the Irrawaddy Delta, Liangdang, and Shwegyin and Minla townships under the jurisdiction of Thayawady District also experienced continuous fires in March, causing heavy losses to our overseas Chinese in Burma. After the fires occurred in various places, our embassy in Burma and overseas Chinese organizations wrote letters or sent representatives to the disaster areas to express condolences and launch fundraising for disaster relief. The Relief Group of the Preparatory Committee of the Burmese Chinese Representatives Conference promptly allocated relief funds and sent personnel to Prome, Pauktaw, and other places for emergency relief. The disaster-stricken compatriots also organized themselves to implement mutual assistance and self-rescue. The Burmese branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications also allocated low-interest loans to help disaster victims resume their businesses. Under the banner of patriotism, the overseas Chinese in Burma promoted the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and self-reliance, and put forward the slogan of "Disaster relief must prevent disasters," actively raising this year's relief funds, and planning to establish permanent disaster relief and prevention institutions. The Chinese People's Relief Association and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government have sent telegrams to the local disaster-stricken overseas Chinese to express their condolences. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Overseas Chinese Compatriots Affected by Fires in Burma:

We have learned that overseas Chinese in Burma have suffered heavy losses from fires, and we are deeply concerned. We hereby send our condolences. We firmly believe that our overseas Chinese compatriots in Burma will be able to unite and help each other, overcome difficulties, and stabilize the lives of the disaster-stricken people as soon as possible.
