Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The heroic struggle of our captured personnel in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island to win reasonable treatment and the right to return to their motherland has ruthlessly exposed the extreme hypocrisy of the U.S. claims that our captured personnel "refuse repatriation" and the so-called "humanitarian principles" adopted by the U.S. towards prisoners of war. According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo, after our captured personnel in the U.S. 76th Prisoner of War Camp on Geoje Island detained Brigadier General Dodd, the head of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, on the 7th, they presented four demands to the U.S., which were accepted in a reply letter from Brigadier General Colson, the new head of the prisoner-of-war camp. Dodd left the prisoner-of-war camp on May 10th.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 12th, General Clark, the new Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations forces, revealed in a statement on the 12th regarding Dodd's detention that our captured personnel had made the following four demands:

"(1) Your command must immediately stop the barbaric acts, insults, torture, forced writing of blood oaths of protest, coercion, confinement, massacres, shootings and machine-gun strafing, the use of poison gas, bacteriological weapons, and experimental subjects for atomic bombs. You should guarantee that prisoners of war enjoy the human rights and personal life stipulated by international law. (2) Immediately stop the illegal and unreasonable so-called 'voluntary repatriation' of prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. (3) Immediately stop the forced investigation (screening) – a measure designed to re-arm thousands of prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, subjecting them to perpetual and illegal servitude. (4) Your command must immediately recognize the prisoner-of-war delegations (committees) composed of prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and cooperate closely with them."

These demands made by our captured personnel are entirely justified and reasonable. Their just struggle against the U.S. for the myriad abuses and massacres inflicted upon them in violation of the Geneva Convention and humanitarian principles, and to win the right to return to their motherland and reunite with their families, eloquently exposes the shameless and outrageous lies of the U.S. regarding "humanitarian treatment," "respect for the inherent rights of prisoners of war," and the "screening results" fabricated by Ridgway and Truman about more than 100,000 of our captured personnel "refusing repatriation." According to Clark's statement, Colson also acknowledged the bloody crimes of the U.S. in the past persecution and massacre of our captured personnel in his reply to the demands of our captured personnel. Colson's reply stated: "Regarding the first item in your letter, I definitely acknowledge that there have been bloody incidents, resulting in many prisoners of war being killed or injured by the United Nations forces. I can assure you that prisoners of war in this camp can expect to receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law in the future. I am willing to do everything in my power to prevent violence and bloodshed from happening again. If such incidents occur in the future, I am willing to take responsibility." In response to the second demand of our captured personnel, namely to immediately stop the so-called "voluntary repatriation," Colson excused himself by saying: "This issue is being discussed in Panmunjom, and I cannot control the decisions made by the peace conference." Regarding the third demand, Colson admitted that the U.S. had previously conducted illegal forced "screening" activities against our captured personnel. He replied: "Regarding the third item you raised concerning forced investigation (screening), I can inform you that after you release General Dodd without harm, we will no longer conduct forced screening or any re-arming actions of prisoners of war in this prisoner-of-war camp, and we will no longer conduct any nominal screening." Regarding the fourth demand, Colson replied that he agreed. Colson's personally signed reply letter was delivered to our captured personnel on the 10th.

Although the above four demands of our captured personnel and Colson's reply were only published after being suppressed by the U.S. for three days, with some deletions and alterations, and although Colson's reply did not satisfy all the demands of our captured personnel, nevertheless, as an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th acknowledged, Colson's reply "is an admission of what the Communists have consistently accused the United Nations forces of doing." This has placed the American aggressors, who are full of "humanity" and "justice" but are actually trying to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, in an extremely embarrassing situation. An Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th described the awkward situation of the American aggressors: "Clark is holding a hot potato. This hot potato is too hot to hold, and it cannot be thrown away, because throwing it away may cause trouble again." Indeed, the Dodd detention incident has revealed the inhumane dark secrets of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. Colson's reply was a heavy slap in the face to the likes of Truman, Ridgway, and Joy. The essence of the U.S.'s so-called "voluntary repatriation" is now even more obvious to the world.

Precisely because of this, the American aggressors are struggling to extricate themselves. In his statement, Clark flatly denied the facts admitted by Colson, saying that Colson's reply was "acting on his own initiative" and that Colson's reply was "made under great duress." However, Clark's statement backfired. People know that Clark's predecessor, Ridgway, had ordered Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, on the 9th to "take any necessary action, use any force, and quickly rescue Dodd," and that Van Fleet personally went to Geoje Island on the same day (the day before Colson wrote the reply letter) to give instructions to Colson, who took over the prisoner-of-war camp from the detained Dodd, and returned saying that Colson "has full authority to deal with the situation." Colson was neither "acting on his own initiative" nor subjected to any "duress," but merely admitted the facts of persecution in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp and guaranteed that forced screening would not happen again. Clark's denial, whether an attempt to overturn Colson's promise or an attempt to cover up the U.S.'s bloody atrocities and forced screening of our captured personnel, is futile. People all over the world can see the true face of the American aggressors more clearly from the Dodd detention incident.

The U.S. aggressors' despicable trick of trying to use the blood-stained fig leaf of "voluntary repatriation" to cover up the truth of their killing and detaining our captured personnel, and to stubbornly obstruct the armistice negotiations, has been repeatedly and solemnly denounced by our negotiation representatives, and has been thoroughly exposed and completely bankrupt by the heroic resistance of our captured personnel this time.

    巨济岛我被俘人员英勇反抗行动
    彻底揭穿美方“自愿遣返”的骗局
    【新华社十三日讯】巨济岛上美方战俘营中我方被俘人员为争取合理待遇和重返祖国的权利而进行的英勇斗争，无情地揭穿了美方扬言我方被俘人员“拒绝遣返”以及美方所谓对战俘采取“人道原则”的极端虚伪性。据美联社东京消息，巨济岛上美军第七十六号战俘营中的我方被俘人员于七日将美方战俘营负责人杜德准将扣留后，即向美方提出四项要求，并经美方新任战俘营负责人柯尔生准将复信表示接受，因而在五月十日杜德离开了战俘营。
    据美联社东京十二日电新任联合国军总司令克拉克在十二日发表的关于杜德被扣留的声明透露，我方被俘人员提出了下列的四项要求：
    “（一）你方司令部立即停止野蛮行为、侮辱、酷刑、强迫写血书抗议、威逼、禁闭、集体屠杀、枪杀和机关枪扫射、使用毒气、细菌武器、原子弹实验对象。你方应当保证让战俘享受国际法所规定的人权和个人生活。（二）立即停止对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘实行非法而无理的所谓‘自愿遣返’。（三）立即停止强迫调查（甄别）——这种措施是要把数以千计的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘重新武装起来，使他们受到永远而非法的奴役。（四）你方司令部立即承认朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军战俘组成的战俘代表团（委员会），并与之密切合作。”
    我方被俘人员提出这些要求是完全正当合理的。他们为反对美方违反日内瓦公约和人道原则而加给他们的百般虐待和屠杀，为争取重返祖国并与家人团聚的权利而进行的正义斗争，雄辩地揭穿了美方所谓“人道主义的待遇”、“尊重战俘天赋权利”，以及李奇微和杜鲁门捏造的关于十万名以上我方被俘人员“拒绝遣返”的“甄别结果”，是怎样无耻的漫天大谎。据克拉克发表的声明，柯尔生在答复我方被俘人员的要求时也承认了美方过去迫害及屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行。柯尔生的答复说：“关于你们来信中的第一条，我肯定承认有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或打伤。我可以向你们提出保证，将来这个俘虏营里的战俘可以希望得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇。我愿尽自己的一切力量使暴力行动和流血事件不再发生。如果将来有这类事件发生，我愿负责。”在答复我方被俘人员第二项要求，即立即停止实行所谓“自愿遣返”时，柯尔生推脱说：“这个问题正在板门店进行讨论，和平会议所作的决定，我管不了。”关于第三项要求，柯尔生承认美方过去对我方被俘人员进行非法的强迫“甄别”活动，他答复说：“关于你们所提的有关强迫调查（甄别）问题的第三条，我可以通知你们，在你们不加伤害地释放了杜德将军以后，我们不再对这个战俘营里的战俘进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动，同时不再进行任何有名无实的甄别。”关于第四项要求，柯尔生答复表示同意。柯尔生亲自签署的答复信是在十日送交我方被俘人员的。
    尽管我方被俘人员的上述四项要求和柯尔生的复信是经过美方扣压了三天才发表的，其中不无删改之处，尽管柯尔生的答复并未满足我方被俘人员的全部要求，但是，如美联社东京十三日电承认的，柯尔生的答复，“是承认了共方一直指责联合国军不断在做的事”。这就使得那些满口“人道”、“正义”而实际上是要强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的美国侵略者，陷于极端狼狈的境地。美联社东京十三日电描述美国侵略者的尴尬景况时说：“克拉克手里拿着一个烫手的山药蛋。这个山药蛋太烫了，拿不好拿，丢又丢不得，因为丢出去可能又要惹事生非。”的确，杜德被扣事件揭开了巨济岛美方俘虏营的惨无人道的黑幕。柯尔生的复信狠狠地打了杜鲁门、李奇微、乔埃之流的嘴巴。美方所谓“自愿遣返”的实质，从此更加大白于天下了。
    正因为这样，美国侵略者正挣扎着为自己解脱。克拉克在声明中矢口否认柯尔生所承认的事实，一说柯尔生的复信是“自作主张”，又说柯尔生的答复是“在极大胁迫之下作出的”。但是，克拉克的声明弄巧反拙了。人们知道，克拉克的前任者李奇微在九日曾命令美第八军军长范佛里特“采取任何必要行动，使用任何力量，赶快拯救杜德”，而范佛里特在当日（即柯尔生写复信的前一天）就亲自到巨济岛去向接替被扣留的杜德掌管俘虏营的柯尔生面授机宜，回来后并说柯尔生“有全权应付局面”。柯尔生既非“自作主张”，也没有受任何“胁迫”，只仅仅是承认了巨济岛俘虏营的迫害事实并保证不再发生强迫甄别而已。克拉克的否认不管是企图推翻柯尔生的诺言也罢，或者是企图掩饰美方对我方被俘人员的血腥暴行和强迫甄别也罢，都是徒劳的。全世界人民都可以从杜德被扣事件中更加看清美国侵略者的真面目了。
    美国侵略者想利用“自愿遣返”这块染满血迹的遮丑布来掩盖其杀害和扣留我方被俘人员的真相，并蛮横地阻挠停战谈判的可恶骗局，经过我方谈判代表的一再严正指斥，并经这次我方被俘人员英勇反抗，是已经揭露无余而彻底破产了。
