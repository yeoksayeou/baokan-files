Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 24th: A special correspondent from this agency reports: After assuming the role of chief representative for the U.S. side in the armistice negotiations, Harrison, at the first formal delegation meeting on the 23rd, proposed a three-day recess, attempting to evade the conclusive evidence of the U.S. side's isolation and "screening" of our captured personnel under the threat of bayonets.

Harrison reiterated the hypocritical old tune of Joi regarding the U.S. side's "humane" "screening" of our captured personnel, but he was utterly speechless in the face of the facts of the U.S. massacre and injury of our captured personnel in Busan and the implementation of forced, terroristic "screening" on Geoje Island.

General Nam Il said to him: "What you say about not repatriating our captured personnel at bayonet point is a pack of lies. The fact before the people of the world is that your side is forcibly detaining our captured personnel at bayonet point."

Harrison had no answer to the questions raised by General Nam Il based on ironclad evidence, and only said: "I suggest a recess."

General Nam Il asked him: "Are you trying to refuse to answer my questions?" Harrison did not dare to answer.

General Nam Il asked: "Your attitude is not one of consultation. Do you want to refuse consultation?" Harrison still weakly replied: "I suggest a recess." But he did not mention when the recess would end.

General Nam Il asked him to clarify, but Harrison refused to negotiate, saying: "I suggest a recess until your side is willing to accept our proposal." General Nam Il clearly told him: "You are fully aware that we have firmly and irrevocably rejected your proposal." Harrison then suggested a recess until May 27th.

General Nam Il pointed out: "We have always insisted that the meetings continue as scheduled. However, in order to give your side time to reconsider your attitude and accept our proposal, we agree to a recess until May 27th."

It is firmly believed here that if Harrison does not abandon the bankrupt lie of the U.S. side that our captured personnel do not want to return home, a three-day recess will not save Harrison from factual accusations. Just when a complete agreement could be reached, the U.S. side adopted extremely barbaric obstructionist tactics, and now Harrison has adopted a delaying tactic of requesting a recess. This shows that the U.S. side must bear full responsibility for the delay in the Korean armistice.

    我方同意朝鲜停战谈判休会三天  以便美方重新考虑接受我方方案
    【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者报道：美方代表哈利逊在担任美方停战谈判首席代表之后，在二十三日第一次正式代表团大会上就建议休会三天，妄图逃避美方在刺刀威逼下隔离和“甄别”我方被俘人员的确凿罪证。
    哈利逊重弹了乔埃关于美方“甄别”我方被俘人员的“人道”的伪善老调，但在美方在釜山屠杀和打伤我方被俘人员和在巨济岛实行恐怖强迫“甄别”的事实面前，他却完全无话可说。
    南日将军对他说：“你们说什么你们不能用刺刀尖遣返我方被俘人员，那是骗人的鬼话。摆在世界人民面前的事实，却是你方正在用刺刀尖强迫扣留我方被俘人员。”
    对南日将军根据铁的证据提出的问题，哈利逊无言可答，只是说：“我建议休会。”
    南日将军问他说：“你是想拒绝回答我的问题吗？”哈利逊也不敢答复。
    南日将军问道：“你方的态度不是协商的态度。你想拒绝协商吗？”哈利逊仍是无力地回答说：“我建议休会。”但他没有提到休会到什么时候。
    南日将军请他加以说明，哈利逊竟表示拒绝协商说：“我建议休会到你方愿意接受我方方案时为止。”南日将军明白地告诉他说：“你们充分地知道我们已确定不移地拒绝了你们的方案。”哈利逊接着建议休会到五月二十七日。
    南日将军指出：“我们一向坚持会议照常进行。但为了使你方有时间重新考虑你们的态度并接受我们的方案，我们同意休会到五月二十七日。”
    此间坚定地认为，如果哈利逊不放弃美方所谓我方被俘人员不愿回家的破产了的谎言，三天的休会也不能挽救哈利逊免受事实的诘难。正当完全的协议可以达成的时候，美方却采取了横蛮无理已极的阻挠手段，现在哈利逊更采取了要求会议休会的拖延策略，这说明美方必须对朝鲜停战的延迟负全部责任。
