    Organization is the Way Out for Peasants
    Editor: I am working in the production work group in Lingtou Township, Fuding County, Fujian Province. Recently, I visited Shen Siyi, Liu Xiaye, and Liu Xialu, members of the Zhang Jingsong mutual aid team in this township. Through this visit, I realized that the road of "organization" as instructed by Chairman Mao is the only way out for peasants. Shen Siyi was originally from a poor peasant background and used to make foil (superstitious items) in Wenzhou. When he returned to his hometown last year, he did not join the mutual aid team and cultivated the land by borrowing other people's farm tools and cattle. In this way, he could only borrow other people's cattle when they were free. Sometimes, when he had plowed halfway with someone else's cattle, they needed to use them, so he had to return them and had to hire someone to plow at a high price, which was very disadvantageous. This year, Shen Siyi joined the mutual aid team, and he overcame the difficulties of lacking cattle and farm tools. Liu Xiaye is also from a poor peasant background. He used to like gambling and did not work hard. The villagers regarded him as a hooligan. After joining the mutual aid team, he also gradually changed. In the beginning, when he participated in the mutual aid team's labor, he was always late and left early, only doing six points of work. Now he has become accustomed to labor. He has been working very hard on accumulating fertilizer this year. He said, "In the past, I would only burn twenty dan of ash at this time, but this year I have already burned seventy dan." The mutual aid team also has many benefits for middle peasants. Liu Xialu is a middle peasant. He said to me, "A dam in my field has not been repaired since I was born. This year, under the call of the People's Government, I joined the mutual aid team, and everyone repaired it with a single effort. If it were just me, I don't know when I would be able to repair it." In short, all three personally experienced that mutual aid labor is much better than working alone. Xie Zuozhen

    组织起来是农民的出路
    编辑同志：我在福建省福鼎县岭头乡生产工作组工作。最近我访问了这个乡张景崧互助组的组员沈思宜、刘吓叶、刘吓禄。在这次访问里，我体会到毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的道路是农民的唯一出路。沈思宜原是贫农出身，过去在温州打箔（迷信品）。去年他转业回乡时，没有参加互助组，借用别人的农具和耕牛耕种。这样，只在别人的耕牛有空的时候他才能借用，有时借人家的牛犁到一半，人家要用就得送回，只好重价雇人来犁，很是吃亏。今年沈思宜参加了互助组，便克服了缺牛缺农具的困难。刘吓叶也是贫农成分，原来喜欢赌博，不好好劳动，村里人把他当流氓看待，参加互助组后，他也慢慢转变过来了。开始时，他参加互助组劳动，每天迟到早回，只做六分工。现在他已经习惯了劳动。他今年对积肥很努力，他说：“过去这时候我还只烧灰二十担，今年已烧了七十担。”互助组对中农同样有很多好处，刘吓禄是中农，他对我说：“我田里的一条水坝，自我出世以来都没修过，今年我在人民政府号召下参加了互助组，大家一动手就修好了。如果是我一个人，也不知要到那年才能修起。”总之，三个人都亲身体验到互助劳动比单干好得多。谢作珍
