Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 26th: Since the Chinese People's Volunteer Army actively helped the Korean people with spring planting during breaks in combat, they have made great achievements, enabling many rural areas to complete their spring planting tasks ahead of schedule. According to incomplete statistics from just a few units, they have helped the Korean people cultivate 66,918 mu of land, reclaimed over 500 mu of wasteland, sown 7,338 mu of land, transported 8,491,178 dan of manure, and built 399 *huali* of water diversion dams (capable of irrigating 18,213 mu of paddy fields), and planted 4,574,684 trees. In addition, these units also helped the Korean people build many houses and plant many vegetables.

In helping the Korean people with spring planting, commanders and soldiers of various units worked as conscientiously and responsibly as if they were farming on their own homeland, practicing deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Many units organized agricultural guidance groups to promptly summarize and disseminate farming experience; and established ironworking and woodworking groups to collect discarded materials to make farm tools. One unit alone made more than 200 iron shovels in just ten days and sent them to Korean farmers who lacked farm tools. The soldiers showed great enthusiasm for labor in the spring planting. One unit, while performing tense and arduous tasks, still set aside four hours a day to help local residents repair dikes and dams. The soldiers said: "In order to prevent the Korean people from leaving their fields uncultivated and to produce more grain, we are not afraid of being tired or suffering." Some units introduced to the Korean people the experience of Chinese farmers organizing mutual aid teams for production, and helped them organize mutual aid teams, thereby improving production efficiency. For example, after hearing the propaganda from the Volunteer Army soldiers, the farmers of Beitun Village in Tieyuan immediately convened a village meeting and organized six mutual aid teams on the spot, solving the difficulties of lacking cattle, farm tools, and manpower, and formulated a plan to apply more fertilizer, hoe more, and cultivate more. Wen Chengye, the secretary of the Labor Party branch in the village, proposed at the meeting: "Respond to Premier Kim's call for more grain production with practical actions and learn from the Chinese Li Shunda Agricultural Mutual Aid Team!"

While assisting the Korean people with spring planting, the Volunteer Army units universally launched a movement to practice economy and provide disaster relief, and established organizations such as economy and disaster relief committees and disaster investigation teams to assist the local Korean government in disaster relief work. The Volunteer Army has distributed the first batch of relief grain of 1,420,353 *jin* at the end of March and the beginning of April, enabling more than 156,000 Korean refugees, who were starving under the devastation of the American aggressors, to get through the spring famine safely.

The internationalist actions of the Volunteer Army units in actively helping the Korean people with spring planting and saving Korean disaster victims have aroused widespread praise among the Korean people, and further inspired the Korean people's high enthusiasm for labor, enabling many areas to complete the spring planting work ahead of schedule. With the help of a Volunteer Army unit, farmers in a certain area completed the task of sowing 2,600 mu of wheat five days ahead of schedule, and it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 480,000 *jin*. The Korean people praised the great internationalist spirit of the Volunteer Army with phrases such as "Creators of People's Happiness," "Defenders of People's Happiness," and "Unforgettable International Friendship" on the letters of thanks and banners presented to the Volunteer Army. Gan Lizhang, a 74-year-old farmer in a certain village, held the hand of a Volunteer Army soldier tightly and said: "I want to tell our descendants to always remember our sincere friends—the great Chinese People's Volunteer Army."

    志愿军帮助朝鲜人民春耕生产获很大成绩
    各部普遍节约救灾已发放粮食百余万斤
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】中国人民志愿军各部队在战斗空隙中积极帮助朝鲜人民春耕生产以来已做出很大成绩，使许多农村提前完成了春耕任务。仅据几个部队的不完全统计，帮助朝鲜人民耕地达六万六千九百十八市亩，开荒五百多市亩，播种七千三百三十八市亩，送粪八百四十九万一千一百七十八担，修筑输水堤坝三百九十九华里（可以灌溉一万八千二百十三市亩稻田），植树四百五十七万四千六百八十四株。另外这些部队还帮助朝鲜人民盖了许多房屋和种了许多蔬菜。
    在帮助朝鲜人民春耕生产中，各部队指挥员和战斗员们像在自己祖国土地上耕作一样，做到认真负责，深耕细作。很多单位组织了农业指导小组，及时总结和传播耕种经验；并成立了铁工组、木工组，收集废弃材料打造农具。某部仅在十天内，就打造了二百多把铁锹，送给缺乏农具的朝鲜农民。战士们在春耕中都显示高度的劳动热情，某部在执行紧张而繁重的任务中，仍然每天抽出四小时帮助驻地居民修堤筑坝。战士们说：“为使朝鲜人民不荒田和多打粮食，我们不怕累也不怕苦。”有的部队向朝鲜人民介绍中国农民组织互助组进行生产的经验，并且帮助他们组织互助组，因而提高了生产效率。如铁原北屯村的农民听了志愿军战士的宣传以后，立刻召开村民大会，当场组织了六个互助组，解决了缺乏耕牛、农具和人力等困难，并且订出了多施肥、多锄、多耕的计划。劳动党村支部书记文成烨在大会上提出：“用实际行动响应金首相多产粮食的号召，向中国李顺达农业互助组学习！”
    在协助朝鲜人民春耕的时候，志愿军各部队中普遍展开了节约救灾运动，并且成立了节约救灾委员会、灾情调查组等组织，协助当地朝鲜政府进行救灾工作。志愿军已在三月底四月初发放首批救济粮一百四十二万零三百五十三斤，使十五万六千多在美国侵略者摧残下饥饿的朝鲜难民安度春荒。
    志愿军各部队积极帮助朝鲜人民春耕生产和节约救济朝鲜灾民的国际主义行动，已在朝鲜人民中引起广泛的赞扬，并更加激励了朝鲜人民高度的劳动热情，使许多地区的春耕工作提前完成。某地农民在志愿军某部的帮助下提前五天完成两千六百亩的种麦任务，预计可以增产粮食四十八万斤。朝鲜人民在献给志愿军的感谢状和锦旗上，以“人民幸福的创造者”“人民幸福的保卫者”“难忘的国际友情”等语句来颂扬志愿军的伟大的国际主义精神。某村七十四岁老农民杆礼章紧紧握住一位志愿军战士的手说：“我要告诉我们的后代永远记住我们真挚的友人——伟大的中国人民志愿军。”
