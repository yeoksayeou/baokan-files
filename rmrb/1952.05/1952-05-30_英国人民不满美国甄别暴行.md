Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: The British Conservative government's efforts to support its American master's discredited claim of "voluntary repatriation" have aroused dissatisfaction among broad sections of the British people, including many Labor Party members.

Since the American invaders put forward the unreasonable plan of repatriating only 70,000 of our captured personnel in the armistice negotiations, the Conservative government has praised this untenable plan as "very fair." However, the broad masses of the British people have long been deeply dissatisfied with the US imperialists' conspiracy to deliberately delay and undermine the armistice negotiations and the British government's obsequious attitude towards the United States. After the American General Colson confessed to the bloody crimes of the US side in the Geji Island prisoner-of-war camp, including slaughtering, persecuting, and forcibly screening our captured personnel, this dissatisfaction among the British people has increased even more. As Labor MP Donalee said in the House of Commons on the 21st: "In Britain, people are greatly shocked, they do not believe the statements made for some time about the situation of the prisoners of war." "Reynolds News" also said: The American method of "screening" prisoners of war has been exposed, which shows that the so-called refusal of 100,000 prisoners of war to return is completely fictitious.

In this situation where popular anger is hard to quell, according to a British Information Services dispatch from London on the 23rd, the Conservative government, on the one hand, hastened to shirk its responsibility, claiming that the United States had "never" "consulted" with Britain "on various issues related to the recent events in Korea"; but on the other hand, it still brazenly praised the US unreasonable plan as a "fair way to resolve differences." This servile attitude of the British government aroused great anger among the British people, so that many Labor MPs in the House of Commons questioned the government, many Labor MPs "expressed doubts about the Americans' fairness and the prisoners' statements" (United Press London, May 19th), and expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' arbitrary attitude. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 26th, the "loud cheers" from the MPs were aroused by the speeches of many Labor MPs "complaining that Britain had no say in the armistice negotiations or the Geji Island incident investigation committee." The dispatch admitted: "Increasingly, implicit and explicit criticisms of American actions are becoming more common in the House of Commons."

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS Moscow, May 27th: "Pravda" correspondent in London, Mayevsky, reported that even the most reactionary newspapers in London did not show any enthusiasm for the dispatch of British and Canadian troops to Geji Island. British and Canadian troops were sent to Geji Island by order of the US military headquarters in Korea to participate in the new atrocities that the invaders are preparing to take against the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. He wrote that the British ruling clique and its newspapers were very panicked after the exposure of British atrocities in Malaya, and did not want to be attacked by people's protests again. They were clumsily trying to excuse themselves, saying that they had nothing to do with the American crimes on Geji Island. A few days ago, an official spokesman of the British Foreign Office said that the United States had "never" "consulted" with Britain "on various issues related to the recent events in Korea."

Mayevsky said that this approach of the British ruling clique did not win Washington's favor. The US military authorities immediately ordered the deployment of British troops to Geji Island, making it impossible for London to deny its participation in the US actions in Korea.

Mayevsky wrote that all honest British people expressed great indignation at the dispatch of British troops to the "island of death" to participate in the new crimes of the US imperialists. The movement to ban bacteriological weapons, investigate the crimes of the US imperialists on Geji Island, and demand an immediate end to the Korean War is developing more and more vigorously in Britain.

    英国人民不满美国甄别暴行
    【新华社二十九日讯】英国保守党政府竭力替美国主人声名狼籍的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张捧场的态度，已经引起了英国广大阶层人民以至许多工党人士的不满。
    自从美国侵略者在停战谈判中提出了只遣返我方七万被俘人员的无理方案之后，保守党政府就极口称赞这个早就站不住脚的无理方案是“非常公道”的。但是，广大的英国人民对于美帝国主义蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判的阴谋和英国政府对美国曲意奉迎的态度，早就深感不满。而在美国将军柯尔生供认了美方在巨济岛战俘营中对我方被俘人员进行虐杀、迫害和强迫甄别的血腥罪行以后，英国人民的这种不满情绪就更加高涨。正如工党议员唐纳黎二十一日在下议院所说的：“在英国，人们大为震动，他们不相信若干时日以来所发表的关于战俘处境的那些声明。”“雷诺新闻”也说：美国人所使用的“甄别”战俘办法被揭穿了，这就显出所谓十万战俘拒绝遣返一事是完全虚构的。
    在这种众怒难犯的情况下，据英国新闻处伦敦二十三日电透露，保守党政府一方面赶紧推卸自己的责任，声称在与朝鲜最近事件有关的各项问题上，美国都“未曾”与英国“磋商”；但另一方面却仍然厚颜无耻地歌颂美方的无理方案是“解决分歧的公平办法”。英国政府的这副奴才相激起了英国人民的极大愤怒，以致在下院中的许多工党议员，都对政府提出了质询，许多工党议员“对美国人的公正和俘虏的声明表示怀疑”（合众社伦敦十九日电），并且对于美国的专横态度表示不满。据合众社伦敦二十六日电，不少工党议员“抱怨英国在停战谈判或巨济岛事件调查委员会中都没有发言权”的发言，都引起了议员们的“大声喝采”。该电承认：“下院中愈来愈常见隐隐地和公开地对美国行动表示不信任的批评了。”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日电：“真理报”驻伦敦记者马耶夫斯基报道，甚至伦敦最反动的报纸，也并未对派遣英国和加拿大军队到巨济岛去一事表示任何热诚。英、加军队是奉朝鲜美军司令部之命，到巨济岛参加侵略者正在准备对朝中战俘采取的新暴行的。他写道，英国统治集团和它的报纸在英国对马来亚的暴行被揭发以后非常惊慌，不想再受到人民抗议的夹击，他们正在笨拙地为自己开脱，说什么他们与美国在巨济岛的罪行无关。英国外交部一个官方发言人在几天前说，在与朝鲜最近的事件有关的各个问题上，美国都“未曾与”英国“磋商”。
    马耶夫斯基说，英国统治集团的这种手法没有博得华盛顿的欢心。美国军事当局立即下令调英军前往巨济岛，从而使伦敦再也无法否认它参与美国在朝鲜的行动。
    马耶夫斯基写道，所有诚实的英国人都对派遣英军到“死亡之岛”参加美帝国主义者的新的罪行，表示极大的愤慨。要求禁止细菌武器、调查美帝国主义者在巨济岛的罪行以及要求立即停止朝鲜战争的运动，正在英国日益有力地发展起来。
