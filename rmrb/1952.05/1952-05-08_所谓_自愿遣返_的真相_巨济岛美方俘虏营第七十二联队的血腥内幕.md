    The Truth About So-Called "Voluntary Repatriation"
    ——The Bloody Inside Story of the 72nd Regiment of the US Prisoner-of-War Camp on Geoje Island
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Shu
    What is the truth behind the so-called "voluntary repatriation" stubbornly insisted upon by the American aggressors at the Korean armistice talks? Clear answers can be found in the recent confessions of several US-sent special agents Liu Chenghan, Mou Bingyun, Tan Guangqing, and Zhang Wenrong, who were captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    These special agents had all served in the 72nd Regiment of the US prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. Their positions were as battalion secretary, company commander, personnel section chief, and squad leader, respectively. They were transferred from the prisoner-of-war camp in November and December of last year, received short-term training in espionage, and were then transported by American aircraft to the skies over northern Korea in February and March of this year, parachuting into our army's rear to gather military intelligence. They were captured by our army immediately after landing. During interrogation, they frankly confessed to the bloody inside story of the American aggressors' crimes in manufacturing "voluntary repatriation" in their prisoner-of-war camp.
    According to Liu Chenghan, a special agent parachuted into Yichuan County on February 25th and captured by our army, who had served as the personnel section chief of the "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia National Salvation Corps" and the academic director of the "CIE School" in the US prisoner-of-war camp's 72nd Regiment, the American aggressors had long been plotting to forcibly detain our captured personnel in order to recruit cannon fodder for their loyal lackey - the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. From September of last year, they successively transferred a large number of Chiang bandits' special agents from Taiwan, distributing them to various prisoner-of-war camps to serve as "instructors" and other positions. At that time, the 72nd Regiment had two "instructors" and two "recorders." The names of these two "instructors" were Zhang Xingdeng and Zhang Qidong, both special agents of the Second Bureau of the Chiang bandit's Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau.
    Liu Chenghan confessed that after a large number of Chiang bandit special agents arrived on Geoje Island, the American aggressors handed over the butcher's knife for directly persecuting our captured personnel to these fascist henchmen. They officially established the bandit "Kuomintang Geoje Island 63rd Branch" in the 72nd Regiment, and under the direct instructions of the American intelligence agencies "CIC", "G-2", and the Kuomintang Central Committee of the Chiang bandit gang in Taiwan, systematically launched criminal activities to persecute our captured personnel. Subsequently, these special agents established a "school" called "CIE", specializing in forcing our captured personnel to undergo reactionary education. Our captured personnel were escorted there twice a week to listen to lectures by the Chiang bandit special agents. The special agents used wooden sticks and starvation to coerce our captured personnel into reading the notorious Chiang bandit's "China's Destiny" and "History of the Kuomintang," as well as books publicizing the bloody war history of the American aggression against Korea, and forced our captured personnel to sing the Chiang bandit's "Party Song." According to Mou Bingyun, a special agent parachuted into Yichuan County on February 20th and captured by us, who had served as a clerk in the First Company of the Sixth Battalion of the regiment, our captured personnel, whether wounded or sick, were forced to listen to the lectures, and almost every time several people were beaten bloody by the special agents for refusing to listen or "disrespecting the lecture", and some were also punished by kneeling and starving. In the prisoner-of-war camp, this was called the "bloody lesson."
    The American aggressors not only instructed the Chiang bandit special agents to forcibly conduct fascist education among our captured personnel, but also tried every means to coerce our captured personnel to participate in various reactionary organizations, to alienate the unity among our captured personnel, and to create conditions for the US to forcibly detain our captured personnel. Liu Chenghan confessed that after the Chiang bandit special agents organized the "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia National Salvation Corps" in the 72nd Regiment in August of last year, they openly threatened our captured personnel to participate, claiming that if they did not participate in this organization, they would be "loyal communists" and would not have "life security"; they even shamelessly used "joining the 'Corps' can eat a full meal" and "can avoid beatings and scoldings" to lure and alienate our captured personnel. According to Liu Chenghan, after the "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia National Salvation Corps" was established, the Chiang bandit special agents first tattooed the "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia" slogans in Chinese and English on the bodies of the "Corps members." Then they forcibly tattooed our captured personnel in the camp, and those who refused to be tattooed would be regarded as "stubborn elements" and subjected to "severe punishment." Our captured personnel who refused this bloody persecution, which seriously insulted their personalities, would be beaten and killed.
    This extremely cruel fascist behavior of the American aggressors and Chiang bandit special agents developed to a frenzied level after the negotiations on the fourth item of the armistice talks began. Liu Chenghan confessed that the bandit "Kuomintang Geoje Island 63rd Branch" and the administrative organization of the prisoner-of-war camp hurriedly issued "instructions" and "directives", ordering the special agents of each battalion to quickly complete the tattooing. This bloody tattooing was carried out sequentially throughout the team. Everyone was called out of the team to answer "willing" or "unwilling," and next to them were burly men specializing in beatings—the bandit "Garrison" and instruments of torture, wooden sticks, and bayonets. Tan Guangqing, a special agent parachuted into Yichuan County on February 20th and captured by us, who had served as a company commander in the First Company of the First Battalion of the regiment, confessed that in the 20th squad of the First Battalion, a barber named He among our captured personnel refused to be tattooed, and the Chiang bandit special agents actually viciously ordered our captured personnel to beat him three times each with wooden sticks. After this shameless order was rejected by our captured personnel, the special agents became enraged and personally beat him severely. After He was beaten into a coma, the special agents forcibly tattooed the words "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia" on him.
    Subsequently, the special agents forced our captured personnel to give up their desire to return to their motherland and sign the petition written by the American aggressors and Chiang bandit special agents. The special agents confessed that Sun Zhonggeng, a Chiang bandit special agent who came to the 72nd Regiment in mid-November last year as an "instructor," was ordered to draft a "petition," which stated: "Resolutely refuse to return to the communist side, request to join the Taiwan National Army, counterattack the mainland, and support the United Nations forces' just proposition of voluntary repatriation." They coerced our captured personnel to add their blood fingerprints to this forged "petition." The Chiang bandit special agents even intimidated the personnel among our captured personnel who had been forcibly tattooed, saying: "You have been tattooed, and there is only a dead end if you go back." They also used methods such as "no food if you don't sign" to coerce our captured personnel. After the Chiang bandit special agents beat our captured personnel who refused to sign into a coma, they dipped their own fingers in the blood from the victims' wounds and smeared blood fingerprints on the petition.
    However, despite the American aggressors and Chiang bandit special agents using all kinds of bloody and cruel means to create conditions for their plot to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, they were never able to shake the firm will of our captured personnel to return to our side. The above-mentioned special agents all described the heroic struggles of our captured personnel in the US prisoner-of-war camp to resist the atrocities of the US-Chiang bandit gang. According to their confessions, in late October last year, more than 100 of our captured personnel, including Sun Zhenkui, of the Fourth Battalion of the prisoner-of-war camp, bravely gathered together to resist the enemy's forced tattooing. The US military and the Lee Seung-man guard team stationed in the prisoner-of-war camp dispatched many armored vehicles, surrounded Sun Zhenkui and others, set up machine guns, and then rushed in to beat them with clubs and gun butts. Many of our captured personnel were seriously injured, but they still stood together tightly, singing revolutionary songs such as "The East is Red," and did not yield in the slightest. The US-Chiang bandit gang had no choice but to escort them to the 71st Regiment of the prisoner-of-war camp, similar to the Chiang bandit's Shangrao concentration camp. During the escort, our captured personnel carried and supported their injured comrades, and continued to sing all the way. Tan Guangqing confessed that many of our captured personnel who had been forcibly tattooed with the words "Anti-Communist and Resist Russia" removed these words by all means, regardless of physical pain. As for the incidents of preferring to die rather than sign the forged "petition", there are countless examples. According to Zhang Wenrong, a special agent parachuted into Yichuan County on February 18th and surrendered to us, who had served as a squad leader in the 20th squad of the Fourth Battalion of the regiment: Zhao Zuorui, one of our captured personnel in the Fourth Battalion, refused to sign this forged "petition" and shouted: "Comrades, unite and fight the enemy to the end!"
    The appalling atrocities of the US-Chiang bandit gang revealed in the confessions of these special agents are just a few drops in the bucket of the bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors in their prisoner-of-war camps. However, from here, people can clearly see the ferocious and vicious face of the American aggressors who have completely violated the Geneva Convention in their treatment of prisoners of war. These bloody facts fully prove that the "voluntary repatriation" shouted by the US side at the negotiating table is just a euphemism for massacre and persecution. We will never allow the US side to continue to persecute our captured personnel. The American aggressors must be fully responsible for the consequences of these bloody crimes.

    所谓“自愿遣返”的真相
    ——巨济岛美方俘虏营第七十二联队的血腥内幕
    新华社记者  王殊
    美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判会议上蛮横地坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”的主张，究竟真相如何？人们从最近被中国人民志愿军捕获的几名美方空降特务刘承汉、牟秉云、谭广清、张文荣等的供状中，可以找到明白的答案。
    这几名空降特务，都曾在巨济岛美方俘虏营第七十二联队供过职。他们的职务是大队书记、中队长、人事股长和班长等。他们在去年十一月和十二月先后被调离俘虏营，受了短期的特务工作训练，今年二月和三月间，又先后被美国飞机运到朝鲜北部上空，空降到我军后方来刺探军情。他们在着陆后即被我军捕获。在审讯中，他们直言不讳地供述了美国侵略者在其俘虏营中制造“自愿遣返”罪行的血腥内幕。
    据二月二十五日在伊川郡被我军捕获的、曾在美方俘虏营第七十二联队任“反共抗俄救国团”人事股长及“CIE学校”教务主任的空降特务刘承汉供称，美国侵略者早就阴谋强迫扣留我方被俘人员，为其忠实走狗——台湾蒋介石匪帮搜罗炮灰。从去年九月起，他们就陆续从台湾调来大批蒋匪特务，分配到各俘虏营去充当“教官”及其它职务。第七十二联队当时就来了两个“教官”和两名“记录员”。这两名“教官”的名字是张兴登和张启东，他们都是蒋匪国防部保密局第二厅的特务。
    刘承汉供称，当大批蒋匪特务到巨济岛上以后，美国侵略者就把直接迫害我方被俘人员的屠刀移交到这群法西斯爪牙的手上。他们在第七十二联队中正式成立了匪“国民党巨济岛六三支部”，在美国特务机关“CIC”、情报机关“G——2”和台湾蒋匪国民党中央党部的直接指使下，有计划地展开迫害我方被俘人员的罪恶活动。接着，这些特务们又成立了一个被称为“CIE”的“学校”，专门对我方被俘人员强制进行反动教育。我方被俘人员每周两次被押解到那里，听蒋匪特务们讲课。特务们用木棒和不给饭吃来胁迫我方被俘人员阅读臭名远扬的蒋匪的“中国之命运”和“国民党党史”，以及宣传美国侵朝战争血腥战史的书籍，并强迫我方被俘人员唱蒋匪“党歌”。据二月二十日在伊川郡被我捕获的、曾任该联队六大队一中队文书的空降特务牟秉云供称，我方被俘人员，不论负伤或有病，均被勒令听讲，几乎每次上课都有几个人因拒绝听讲或“蔑视讲课”而被特务们打得混身是血，有的还被罚跪和饿饭一顿。在俘虏营里，这被称为“血的课”。
    美国侵略者不仅指使蒋匪特务在我方被俘人员中强制进行法西斯教育，而且百般胁迫我方被俘人员参加各种反动组织，离间我方被俘人员间的团结，并为美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员制造条件。刘承汉供认，去年八月间蒋匪特务在第七十二联队组织了“反共抗俄救国团”以后，就公开威胁我方被俘人员参加，宣称如不参加这个组织，就是“忠心共党”，就没有“生命保障”；甚至无耻地用“参加了‘团’可以吃饱饭”，“可以不受打骂”等来诱惑离间我方被俘人员。据刘承汉供称，“反共抗俄救国团”成立以后，蒋匪特务即首先在“团员”身上刺上中文和英文的“反共抗俄”等字样。然后他们就在营中强在我方被俘人员身上刺字，如拒绝刺字就要被视为“顽固分子”，受到“严厉处分”。我方被俘人员拒绝这种严重污蔑人格的血腥迫害，就要遭到殴打和杀害。
    美国侵略者和蒋匪特务的这种残暴已极的法西斯行为，到停战谈判的第四项议程谈判开始以后，发展到了疯狂的地步。刘承汉供称，匪“国民党巨济岛六三支部”及俘虏营的行政机构，曾匆忙地发出“训令”、“指示”，限令各大队特务人员迅速完成刺字。这种血腥的刺字是在全队中挨次进行的。每一个人都被叫出队去回答“愿意”或“不愿意”，在旁边则是专司殴打的彪形大汉——匪“警备队”和刑具、木棒、枪刺。二月二十日在伊川郡被我捕获的、曾在该联队一大队二中队任过中队长的空降特务谭广清供称，在一大队二十小队中，我方被俘人员中一姓何的理发员拒绝刺字，蒋匪特务们竟然恶毒地命令我方被俘人员每人用木棒打他三下。这个无耻的命令遭到我方被俘人员的拒绝以后，特务们恼羞成怒，亲自动手痛打。在何被打得昏厥以后，特务们就给他强行刺上“反共抗俄”字样。
    接着，特务们又强迫我方被俘人员放弃返回祖国的愿望，在美国侵略者和蒋匪特务写好的请愿书上签字。空降特务们供称，去年十一月中旬来第七十二联队的“教官”蒋匪特务孙忠鲠，奉命起草了一个“请愿书”，这个请愿书上写着：“坚决不回共方，要求参加台湾国军，反攻大陆，拥护联合国军自愿遣返的正义主张。”等字句。他们威逼我方被俘人员在这个伪造的“请愿书”上加盖血指印。蒋匪特务甚至恫吓我方被俘人员中被强迫刺了字的人员说：“你们已被刺字，回去只有死路一条。”他们并且用“不签字就不给饭吃”等办法来胁迫我方被俘人员。蒋匪特务们在把我方拒绝签字的被俘人员毒打昏厥之后，用自己的手指蘸着被害者伤口的鲜血，在请愿书上涂上血指印。
    然而尽管美国侵略者和蒋匪特务用尽各种血腥残暴的手段，为其强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的阴谋制造条件，他们却始终无法动摇我方被俘人员重返我方的坚定意志。上述空降特务们都叙述了我方被俘人员在美方俘虏营中不断为反抗美蒋匪帮兽行而英勇斗争的情形。据他们供称，去年十月下旬，该俘虏营第四大队我方被俘人员孙振魁等一百多人英勇地聚集在一起，反抗敌人强迫刺字。驻守俘虏营的美军及李承晚警备队出动了许多装甲车，把孙振魁等人团团包围起来，架上机枪，然后冲进去用棍棒枪托殴打他们。我方被俘人员中许多人受了重伤，然而他们仍然紧紧地站在一起，高唱“东方红”等革命歌曲，毫不屈服。美蒋匪帮没有办法，就将他们押解到类似蒋匪上饶集中营的俘虏营第七十一联队去。在被押解途中，我方被俘人员抬着扶着受伤的同伴，一路上仍然高歌不已。谭广清供称，许多被强迫刺上“反共抗俄”字样的我方被俘人员，不顾肉体的痛苦，用一切办法把这些字样除掉。至于宁死不屈，拒绝在伪造的“请愿书”上签名的事件，则更是不胜枚举。据在二月十八日在伊川郡向我投诚的、曾任该联队四大队二十小队班长的空降特务张文荣供称：四大队中我方被俘人员赵佐瑞拒绝在这个伪造的“请愿书”上签字，并高呼：“同志们团结起来，和敌人坚决斗争到底！”
    这些空降特务们的供词中所透露出来的美蒋匪帮的骇人听闻的暴行，还仅仅是美国侵略者在其俘虏营中进行的血腥罪行的点滴。但是人们从这里已经可以清楚地看到彻底破坏日内瓦公约的美国侵略者对待战争俘虏的一副狰狞恶毒的凶相。这些血淋淋的事实，完全证明美方在谈判会议桌上所叫喊的
    “自愿遣返”，只不过是大屠杀大迫害的代名词而已。我们决不容许美方继续残害我方被俘人员。美国侵略者必须对它这些血腥罪行的后果完全负责。
