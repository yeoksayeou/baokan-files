    Anti-Aircraft Gunners on Maryang Hill
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lu Yun
    On the Maryang Hill frontline along the Imjin River, volunteer soldiers have repeatedly shot down enemy aircraft that were wreaking havoc over the position in anti-aircraft firing exercises. Maryang Hill is a position on a hill with an elevation of over 300 meters and a circumference of over 2 kilometers. Enemy artillery shells pound this ridge day and night, and numerous aircraft are dispatched daily for indiscriminate bombing. This is what Van Fleet boasted about as the so-called "three-dimensional bombardment." The soldiers defending this ridge have built solid and concealed fortifications, and deployed a tight anti-aircraft fire network, simultaneously defending against enemy artillery fire and striking at American aerial bandits.

    One day, an enemy reconnaissance plane and four jet fighters were conducting reconnaissance, bombing, and strafing over Maryang Hill. As the reconnaissance plane was diving for reconnaissance, soldier Du Guorun's machine gun opened fire. He fired twenty-six rounds in quick succession, and the reconnaissance plane was hit, caught fire, and crashed into enemy territory. The four fighters circling in the air attempted to retaliate, diving down to drop bombs and strafe. The position was filled with smoke and flying shrapnel. The anti-aircraft gunners fiercely fired at the enemy planes in the smoke. Du Guorun turned his machine gun towards an enemy plane diving down and suddenly opened fire, and the enemy plane immediately emitted a plume of white smoke and fled towards enemy airspace. The other three followed behind it and fled.

    Sometimes, the enemy first uses artillery to bombard Maryang Hill fiercely, and then suddenly sends planes to bomb and strafe. One morning, the enemy concentrated over a dozen artillery pieces to relentlessly bombard the position. As soon as the artillery fire stopped, eight jet fighters swooped in to bomb and strafe the position. But the soldiers were already prepared, and various firearms immediately opened fire. Bullets from every hiding place shot into the air, weaving a tight fire net that made it impossible for the enemy planes to avoid. Machine gunner Yang Deqing shot down an enemy plane with twenty-two rounds. Rifleman Zhang Huaqing hid in a bomb crater, his eyes fixed on the foremost enemy plane. When the enemy plane dived to a height of just over 200 meters above the ground, he fired three shots in succession, and the enemy plane caught fire and crashed on a nearby hillside. Looking at the burning enemy plane, he said, "My rifle has defeated Van Fleet's 'air superiority'." Within half an hour, two of these eight enemy planes were shot down.

    Unable to gain an advantage during the day, enemy planes attacked at night. The soldiers also fought the enemy planes in the dark. One moonlit night, a B-26 bomber had just flown over Maryang Hill and was circling when all the ground fire opened up simultaneously. The enemy plane turned its head to flee, but strings of tracer bullets shot around it. Platoon Leader Zhou Chunting fired thirty-one rounds with his machine gun and shot down the bomber. When the plane crashed and caught fire, the bombs it carried exploded with a deafening roar, blowing the plane to smithereens.

    The warriors defending Maryang Hill not only continue to achieve victories in ground battles, but also achieve great victories in anti-aircraft operations. In the month of April alone, they shot down five enemy planes and damaged eight enemy planes with light firearms such as machine guns and rifles. Many soldiers have become skilled anti-aircraft gunners in the battles against enemy aircraft.

    马良山上的对空射击手
    新华社记者  路云
    临津江前线马良山阵地上的志愿军战士们在对空射击运动中屡次击落在阵地上空肆虐的敌机。马良山是一座标高三百多公尺，方圆二公里多的山头阵地。敌人的大炮不分昼夜地向这座山岭轰击，并且每天出动很多飞机来狂轰滥炸。这就是范佛里特吹嘘的所谓“立体轰击战”。守卫这座山岭的战士们修筑了坚固而隐蔽的工事，布置了严密的对空射击火网，和防御敌人炮击同时，打击着美国空中强盗。
    有一天，敌人的一架侦察机和四架喷气战斗机在马良山上空进行侦察、轰炸、扫射。当侦察机正在俯冲侦察时，战士杜国润的机枪开火了。他连续发射了二十六发子弹，那架侦察机就中弹起火，坠落到敌人阵地上去了。在空中盘旋的四架战斗机企图报复，就连接地俯冲下来投弹扫射。阵地上弥漫着烟雾和飞啸着弹片。对空射击手们就在烟雾中向敌机猛烈射击。杜国润又将机枪对准一架俯冲下来的敌机突然开火，那架敌机就立刻冒出一股白烟，一直向敌方上空逃去。其余的三架也跟在它的后面逃走了。
    敌人有时先用大炮向马良山猛轰，然后突然飞来飞机进行轰炸和扫射。有一天早晨，敌人集中了十几门大炮不停地轰击着阵地，炮声一停，八架喷气战斗机就窜来阵地上空投弹、扫射。但战士们早已准备好了，各种火器立刻开火，子弹从每一个掩蔽处射向空中，交织成一个使敌机无法躲避的严密的火网。机枪手杨得清用二十二发子弹就击落了一架敌机。步枪手张华青隐蔽在一个弹坑里，两眼紧紧地盯着最前面的一架敌机。当那架敌机俯冲到离地面二百多公尺高时，他迎着连打三枪，那架敌机就着火坠落到附近的山坡上去了。他看着燃烧着的敌机说：“我的步枪就把范佛里特的‘空中优势’打垮了。”这八架敌机不到半小时，就被击落了两架。
    敌机白天占不到便宜便在夜间来袭击。战士们，也就在黑夜里和敌机作斗争。一个月色朦胧的晚上，有一架B二十六型轰炸机刚飞到马良山上空盘旋，地面上的各种火器就一齐开放。敌机扭过头来逃窜，但一串串曳光子弹射到了它的周围。排长周春亭用机枪发射了三十一发子弹，就打落了这架轰炸机。当飞机着火坠地时，带在飞机上的炸弹轰然爆炸，把飞机炸了个粉碎。
    守卫在马良山上的勇士们，不仅在地面战斗中不断地取得胜利，而且也在对空作战中取得很大胜利。仅仅在四月一个月内，他们就用机关枪、步枪等轻型火器击落了五架敌机，击伤了八架敌机。有许多战士在和敌机作战中变成了对空射击的能手。
