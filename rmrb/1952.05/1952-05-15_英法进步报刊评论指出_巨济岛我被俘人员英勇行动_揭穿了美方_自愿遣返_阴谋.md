Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 14th: Many progressive newspapers in Western Europe prominently published news on May 9th regarding the detention of U.S. Brigadier General Dodd, the commander of the POW camp on Geoje Island, by our captured personnel. The London "Daily Worker," after exposing the US's terror tactics on Geoje Island, commented: "This news exposes the myth fabricated by the US that prisoners of war are unwilling to be repatriated." The newspaper condemned those servile British politicians who actually support the US's shameless violation of international law. The paper said: "The vast majority of the British people will certainly urge their members of Parliament to force the government to reach an agreement based on the simple, fair, and clear conditions now proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides. That would represent Britain. To pander to the American's hooliganish approach to peace is to betray Britain."

The French "l'Humanité" wrote: "From the Geoje Island incident, people can better judge the value of Truman's despicable statement supporting Ridgway's ultimatum." The newspaper said that the falsity of Truman's statement has also been clearly admitted by the London "Times." The newspaper said on May 8th that for two hundred years, there has been no precedent that does not show that reason lies on the side of the Communists. "In fact, there is no need to go back so far. International agreements stipulate that belligerents should repatriate all prisoners after the cessation of hostilities... Therefore, whether from a legal or humanitarian point of view, the attitude of the Korean and Chinese negotiators is beyond reproach."

    英法进步报刊评论指出
    巨济岛我被俘人员英勇行动揭穿了美方“自愿遣返”阴谋
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】西欧许多进步报纸都在五月九日以显著地位刊载了巨济岛上我方被俘人员扣留美方战俘营负责人杜德准将的消息。伦敦“工人日报”在揭露美方在巨济岛上的恐怖行动之后评论说：“这个消息使美方所谓战俘不愿遣返的奇谈原形毕露了。”该报斥责英国那些一副奴才相的政客居然支持美国无耻地违反国际法的行为。该报说：“绝大多数的英国人民一定将催促他们的议员，要他们迫使政府根据朝中方面现在提出的简单、公平而明确的条件达成协议，这样才能代表英国。而偏袒美国佬的对待和平的流氓手段，那是出卖英国。”
    法国“人道报”写道：“从巨济岛的事件中，人们可以更好地判断杜鲁门支持李奇微的最后通牒的卑鄙声明到底有什么价值了。”该报说，杜鲁门声明的虚伪性也已由伦敦“泰晤士报”明明白白地承认了。该报在五月八日说，二百年来，没有一个先例不说明道理是在共产党方面的。“事实上，还不必追溯这么远，国际协定就规定了交战国在战事停止后应当遣返一切俘虏……因此，无论从法律还是从人道方面来说，朝中方面谈判代表的态度都是无可非议的。”
