Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticism and Suggestions

    All-China Musicians Association and Tianjin Musicians Association and Other Units
    Strengthening Leadership over Workers' Music Activities
    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 19 published a letter from reader Zhong Limin, criticizing the error of Tianjin music workers neglecting workers' music activities. The points mentioned in the letter are basically correct (only individual facts are slightly different, such as the fact that the activities of the "Workers' Music Troupe" have not stopped so far). We are willing to accept this criticism and quickly correct our mistakes.
    In recent years, because we have neglected ideological leadership, we have not been able to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction well and resolutely. After the "Three-Anti" movement and the literary and artistic rectification study, we have found that our past work has serious errors of deviating from politics and deviating from the people.
    In order to correct errors in a timely manner, the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Tianjin Musicians Association and other units launched a song creation campaign for the "May Day" International Labor Day, and especially focused on the creations of the workers themselves. We have received eighty or ninety song creations from workers and professional music workers, and after selection, twenty or thirty songs have been introduced and published, and have been collected in the song selection edited and published by the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles.
    In order to comprehensively study Tianjin's future workers' music work, the Tianjin Musicians Association, the All-China Musicians Association, the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Tianjin Cultural Bureau, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions' Culture and Education Department, and the Central Conservatory of Music and other units jointly held a symposium on April 20, inviting music work cadres from major factories to participate. At the meeting, worker representatives put forward some opinions and hopes of workers on music activities. The Tianjin Musicians Association, the All-China Musicians Association and other units have reviewed the mistakes of not paying attention to workers' music activities in the past, and unanimously guaranteed to correct their mistakes in the future. The responsible comrade of the All-China Musicians Association particularly pointed out that in the future, the musicians associations in major cities, in addition to organizing creation, criticism, and learning, should take the work of carrying out the workers' music movement as an important task.
    In the future, the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Tianjin Musicians Association will regularly organize workers' song creation; the Municipal Cultural Bureau will try to hold various workers' music observation meetings and competitions, and organize professional music groups to tour factories; the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Culture and Education Department will be particularly responsible for the ideological education work in the entire workers' music movement; the Central Conservatory of Music will regularly organize teachers and students to go to factories to experience life, in addition to providing guidance, the main thing is to learn from the working class in order to transform their own thinking; under the assistance of various music groups and schools, the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions' Culture and Education Department plans to focus on running various study classes similar to the nature of workers' amateur music schools, to train a large number of worker cadres with a certain musical accomplishment; the All-China Musicians Association will regularly summarize and promote this work experience to various places.
    We hope that comrades, especially worker comrades, will offer more criticisms and suggestions on our work.

### 全国音协及天津市音协等单位  加强对工人音乐活动的领导

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    全国音协及天津市音协等单位
    加强对工人音乐活动的领导
    编辑同志：三月十九日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊载了读者钟立民的来信，对天津音乐工作者忽视工人音乐活动的错误提出批评。信中所谈各点基本上是正确的（只个别事实略有出入，如“工人音乐团”的活动至今并未停顿），我们愿意接受这个批评，并迅速改正错误。
    近年来，我们因为忽视了思想领导工作，所以不能很好地、坚决地贯彻毛主席的文艺方向。我们经过“三反”运动和文艺整风学习，检查出我们过去的工作有严重的脱离政治、脱离人民的错误。
    为了及时纠正错误，天津市文学艺术界联合会、天津市音乐工作者协会等单位开展了关于“五一”国际劳动节的歌曲创作运动，并特别着重工人们自己的创作。我们先后收到工人们和专业音乐工作者的歌曲创作八、九十首，经挑选介绍发表者有二、三十首，已收集在天津市文学艺术界联合会编辑出版的歌选中。
    为了全面地研究天津市今后的工人音乐工作，天津市音乐工作者协会、中华全国音乐工作者协会、天津市文学艺术界联合会、天津市文化局、天津市总工会文教部和中央音乐学院等单位，在四月二十日联合召开了一次座谈会，邀请了各大工厂音乐工作干部参加。会上工人代表提出工人对音乐活动的一些意见和希望。天津市音乐工作者协会、中华全国音乐工作者协会等单位，对过去不重视工人音乐活动的错误都作了检讨，并一致保证在今后改正错误。全国音乐工作者协会的负责同志特别指出，今后各大城市的音乐工作者协会，除组织创作、批评、学习外，应把开展工人音乐运动的工作，作为一个重要任务。
    今后，天津市文学艺术界联合会、天津市音乐工作者协会要经常组织工人们的歌曲创作；市文化局将尽量举办各种不同性质的工人音乐观摩会、比赛会，并组织音乐专业团体到工厂巡回演出；市总工会文教部将特别负责整个工人音乐运动中的思想教育工作；中央音乐学院将经常组织师生下厂体验生活，除进行辅导工作以外，主要是向工人阶级学习，以求改造自己的思想；天津市总工会文教部在各音乐团体、学校协助之下，拟有重点地举办类似工人业余音乐学校性质的各种学习班，培养大批有一定音乐修养的工人干部；全国音乐工作者协会将经常总结并向各地推广这项工作经验。
    我们希望同志们，尤其是工人同志们，多对我们的工作提出批评和建议。
    中华全国音乐工作者协会
    天津市音乐工作者协会
