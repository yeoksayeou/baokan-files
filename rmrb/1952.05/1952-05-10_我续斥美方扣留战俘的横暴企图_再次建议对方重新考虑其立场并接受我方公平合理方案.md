    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th. At the Korean armistice negotiation delegation meeting on the 9th, our representative continued to vehemently denounce the other party's thorough destruction of the Geneva Convention and violation of all international law, attempting to detain a large number of our captured personnel under the guise of so-called "voluntary repatriation." Our chief representative pointed out that the principle of so-called "voluntary repatriation" is fundamentally untenable. The other party has an unconditional obligation to repatriate all of our captured personnel and has no right to detain prisoners of war under any guise. So-called "screening" of prisoners of war is not allowed at all. The endless stream of bloody incidents in the other party's prisoner-of-war camps fully proves that the so-called "screening" is merely a means of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. The heroic resistance of our captured personnel to bloody suppression exposes the other party's shameful propaganda to slander our captured personnel. Unless the other party abandons its brutal attempt to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, the meeting cannot make any progress. Our side once again suggests that the other party reconsider its position and accept our fair and reasonable compromise proposal of May 2.

    我续斥美方扣留战俘的横暴企图
    再次建议对方重新考虑其立场并接受我方公平合理方案
    【新华社开城九日电】九日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方代表继续痛斥对方彻底破坏日内瓦公约，违反一切国际公法，企图在所谓“自愿遣返”的名义下扣留大量我方被俘人员。我方首席代表指出：所谓“自愿遣返”的原则是根本不能成立的。对方只有无条件遣返全部我方被俘人员的义务，而没有在任何名义下扣留战俘的权利。对战俘根本就不容许进行所谓“甄别”。在对方战俘营中所发生的层出不穷的血案更充分地证明所谓“甄别”只是强迫扣留我方被俘人员的一个手段。我方被俘人员对于血腥镇压的英勇反抗，揭穿了对方一切诬蔑我方被俘人员的可耻宣传。除非对方放弃强迫扣留大量我方被俘人员的横暴企图，会议不可能有任何进展。我方再次建议对方重新考虑其立场，接受我方五月二日的公平合理的折衷方案。
