The Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's publication "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 140 has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Road to International Peace and Friendship" which says: Comrade Stalin's answers to questions posed by a group of American editors have provided a powerful weapon for the millions of people fighting for peace. The editorial also says: Comrade Stalin's answers further confirm the great achievements of the international democratic anti-imperialist camp. The strength of this camp and its influence on the course of history are growing. A third world war is no closer now than it was two or three years ago. Comrade Stalin's answers give a high assessment of the growth of the strength of the camp of peace, democracy and socialism, and a high assessment of the results of the struggle waged by the organized ranks of international peace fighters in recent years, which is entirely in line with the actual situation. The editorial concludes: History has placed before the peace movement a task of global significance - the task of preventing a third world war and maintaining and consolidating peace. This great goal has generated great strength. The number of people who have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact has reached 600,357,000, and public opinion is increasingly firmly supporting the peaceful resolution of international issues that cause international tension. The movement for the conclusion of a peace pact must be strengthened. The bacteriological warfare launched by the American imperialists in Korea and Northeast China - the most despicable crime against humanity - must be stopped! To defeat the conspiracy of the American and British imperialist aggressors to destroy the peoples of all countries depends on the powerful actions and selfless struggles of the peace advocates, and on the increasingly resolute struggles of the people. The great historical task of the Communist and Workers' Parties and all progressive forces throughout the world is to save mankind from the horrors and destruction of a new world war.

Important articles in this issue include: Marshal Voroshilov's speech at the Budapest rally celebrating the 7th anniversary of the liberation of Hungary by the Soviet Army, excerpts from the report by Hoxha, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, at the Second Congress of the Albanian Labor Party: "The Albanian Labor Party Fights to Lay the Socialist Foundation," and Stoica, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, "The Romanian People's Republic Forges Ahead on the Road to Socialist Industrialization," and others.

Stoica's article states: The alliance between the working class and the working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party (now the Workers' Party), has achieved state power, which has created conditions for the rapid and continuous development of our country's productive forces. The victorious completion of the Republic's first one-year national economic plan (1949-50) ensured that production in all economic sectors reached pre-war levels, and some sectors even greatly exceeded pre-war levels. The victorious completion of the 1951 plan - the first year of the first five-year plan - was another big step towards transforming our motherland from an agricultural country into an advanced industrial country with a constantly developing mechanized agriculture. Stoica's article also describes Romania's large-scale construction of industrial enterprises, the improvement of the living standards of the working people, and the fact that socialist economic components have occupied an absolute advantage in the national economy. Stoica continued: By the end of 1951, the proportion of industry in the national economy had increased to 60.4 percent, and the production of means of production accounted for 54.4 percent of total production. These figures reflect the victory of the socialist industrialization policy implemented by millions of Romanian urban and rural working people. The planned industrial output in 1952 will increase by 24.5 percent compared with 1951, and the sector producing means of production will increase by 35 percent, that is, by 75 percent compared with 1950. Stoica then described some of the shortcomings discovered in the past during the completion of the national plan and the specific improvement measures for the implementation of the national plan in 1952. Stoica finally pointed out: Because our working people are full of fighting enthusiasm and firm confidence in the victory of their cause, we will achieve new and major achievements in 1952, and will contribute our own share to the struggle for the victory of the great international democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union in the cause of peace.

Under the heading "Stop the Crimes of the American Imperialists," this issue publishes news of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team exposing the American imperialists' germ warfare in China and Korea, and the angry protests of people around the world.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四○期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四○期已经出版。
    本期发表了题为“国际和平与友好的道路”的社论说：斯大林同志对一批美国编辑所提的问题的答复，使千百万为争取和平而战斗的人民得到了一件强有力的武器。社论又说：斯大林同志的答复进一步证实国际民主反帝国主义阵营已得到了巨大的成就。这个阵营的力量和对历史进程的影响都越来越大了。第三次世界大战现在并不比两三年前更接近。斯大林同志的答复对和平、民主和社会主义阵营的力量的成长作了很高的估价，对国际和平战士有组织的阵线在最近几年中所进行的斗争的结果作了很高的估价，这是完全符合实际情况的。社论最后说：历史已在和平运动面前提出了一个有世界性意义的任务——防止第三次世界大战、保持和巩固和平的任务。这个伟大的目标产生了伟大的力量，在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名的人数，已达六亿零三百五十七万，同时舆论越来越坚决地支持和平解决引起国际紧张局势的国际问题。要求缔结和平公约的运动必须加强。美帝国主义者在朝鲜和中国东北发动的细菌战——对人类的最卑鄙的罪行——必须受到制止！要挫败美、英帝国主义侵略者毁灭各国人民的阴谋，有赖于和平拥护者的有力行动和忘我的斗争，有赖于人民越来越坚决的斗争。共产党和工人党以及全世界一切进步力量的伟大历史任务，就是把人类由新世界大战的恐怖和毁灭中拯救出来。
    本期重要的文章有：伏罗希洛夫元帅在布达佩斯庆祝苏军解放匈牙利第七周年大会上的演说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会总书记霍查在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第二次代表大会上报告的摘录：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为奠定社会主义基础而奋斗”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局候补委员斯托依卡的“罗马尼亚人民共和国在社会主义工业化的道路上前进”等。
    斯托依卡的文章说：工人阶级和劳动人民结成联盟，在共产党（现在的工人党）领导下，取得了国家政权，这就为我国生产力的迅速和不断发展创造了条件。共和国第一个一年的国家经济计划（一九四九—五○年）的胜利完成，保证了各经济部门生产达到了战前水平，有些部门甚至大大超过了战前水平。一九五一年——第一个五年计划第一年计划的胜利完成，又朝着把我们的祖国从一个农业国变成一个拥有不断发展的机械化农业的先进工业国的方向迈进了一大步。斯托依卡的文章并叙述了罗马尼亚大规模建设工业企业，劳动人民生活水准提高和社会主义经济成分已在国民经济中占绝对优势的情形。斯托依卡接着说：到一九五一年年底，工业在国民经济中的比重已经增加到百分之六十点四了，生产资料的生产占全部生产的百分之五十四点四。这些数字反映了千百万罗马尼亚城乡劳动人民实行社会主义工业化政策的胜利。一九五二年计划工业产量要比一九五一年增加百分之二十四点五，生产生产工具的部门要增加百分之三十五，即比一九五○年增加百分之七十五。斯托依卡接着又叙述了过去在完成国家计划期间所发现的若干缺点和一九五二年执行国家计划的具体改进措施。斯托依卡最后指出：由于我国劳动人民满怀着战斗的热诚和对他们事业的胜利的坚定信心，我们将在一九五二年得到新的重大成就，并将对以苏联为首的伟大的国际民主阵营争取和平事业的胜利的斗争贡献出我们自己的一份力量。
    本期在“制止美国帝国主义者的罪行”一栏下刊载了国际民主法律工作者协会调查团揭露美国帝国主义者在中国和朝鲜进行细菌战的消息，和世界各地人民愤怒的抗议。    （新华社）
