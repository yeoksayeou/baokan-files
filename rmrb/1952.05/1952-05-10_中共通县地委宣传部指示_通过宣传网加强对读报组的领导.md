Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

    Tong County Committee Propaganda Department Instruction:
    Strengthen Leadership of Newspaper Reading Groups Through Propaganda Network
    Editor: The People's Daily readers' letters page on April 16th published Wen Chu's letter in the "Newspaper Reading Group Activities" column, suggesting that the Tong County Committee Propaganda Department restore leadership over newspaper reading groups. We believe this suggestion is correct and necessary. The reason why newspaper reading work for Tong County's special district personnel has become laissez-faire is mainly because the County Committee Propaganda Department lacks clear guiding ideology for this work. Since the higher-level Party committee proposed strengthening leadership of newspaper reading groups in 1950, we have delegated this work to the Propaganda Department's Communications Section, county communications officers, and base point village assistants in the district, without dividing the work with the cultural and educational departments and mass organizations at all levels to obtain their assistance. Therefore, after the reorganization of the County Committee Propaganda Department's Communications Section, etc., the work of newspaper reading groups throughout the special district gradually became laissez-faire.
    Looking at the current situation in the entire district, the number of newspaper reading groups is still developing. This is due to our large-scale establishment of a propaganda network last year. However, due to a long-term lack of leadership, these newspaper reading groups are not consolidated and are not of a high standard. Based on the above situation, we have notified all counties, requiring them to closely integrate with the current spring plowing production, strengthen leadership over newspaper reading groups through the Party's propaganda network, and make an appropriate number of developments. On the other hand, we have sent people to various counties for key inspections to summarize experience and promote the rapid restoration, development, and consolidation of newspaper reading groups throughout the district.

### 中共通县地委宣传部指示  通过宣传网加强对读报组的领导

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共通县地委宣传部指示
    通过宣传网加强对读报组的领导
    编辑同志：四月十六日人民日报读者来信专页“读报组活动”栏刊载文矗来信，建议中共通县地委宣传部恢复对读报组的领导，我们认为这一建议是正确的，必要的。通县专区工作人员的读报工作之所以形成自流，主要原因是地委宣传部对这一工作缺乏明确的指导思想。自一九五零年上级党委提出加强对读报组的领导以后，我们就把这一工作交给宣传部通讯科、各县通讯干事和区的基点村助理员，而没有和各级文教部门、群众团体进行分工，以取得他们的协助。因此，当地委宣传部通讯科等改组后，全专区的读报组工作就逐渐形成自流状态。
    就目前全区的情况来看，读报组的数量还是向前发展的。这是由于去年我们大规模建立宣传网的结果。但由于长期缺乏领导，这些读报组是不巩固和水平不高的。根据上述情况，我们已经通报各县，要求紧密地结合目前的春耕生产，通过党的宣传网，加强对读报组的领导，并作适当数量的发展。另方面，我们已派人到各县作重点检查，以总结经验，推动全区读报组迅速恢复、发展和巩固。
