    (4) However, after the national liberation in 1950, Wang Quanbao's thinking changed. He felt that he had strong labor and livestock power and was afraid of suffering losses in the mutual aid team, so he was determined to withdraw and work independently. He said to his son, "We have food and clothing now, and we have donkeys and cattle. You have also married a wife. Let's withdraw from the mutual aid team and make a fortune on our own. How comfortable!" But his son was unwilling and pouted, saying, "Dad, don't forget your roots!"
    (5) Regardless of his son's opposition, Wang Quanbao brought up the matter of withdrawing from the team at the mutual aid team meeting, which surprised everyone. Zhang Weimin, the secretary of the Party branch, advised him not to withdraw from the mutual aid team, but Wang Quanbao had already made up his mind and did not listen to Zhang Weimin's advice.
    (6) In the spring of 1951, the mutual aid team elected Party member Li Sixiao as the team leader, formulated a patriotic pact, and bought new agricultural tools such as five-inch plows. The patriotic production increase campaign was launched enthusiastically.

    （五）王全保不顾儿子的反对，在互助组会议上提出退组的事，大家很吃惊。党支部书记张为民劝他不要退出互助组，可是王全保已经打定了主意，不听张为民的劝告。
    （六）一九五一年的春天来了，互助组选党员李四小为组长，订了爱国公约，买了五吋步犁等新式农具，爱国丰产运动便热烈地展开了。
