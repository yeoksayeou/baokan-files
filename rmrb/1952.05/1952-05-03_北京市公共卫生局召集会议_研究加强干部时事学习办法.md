    Beijing Public Health Bureau Convenes Meeting to Study Measures for Strengthening Cadre Political Study
    Editor: The criticism made by Comrade Xiao Erwen in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 12 was entirely correct. In the past, we have not paid enough attention to the political study of cadres in our affiliated units, and lacked leadership. Sometimes, although there were arrangements, there were no inspections; especially after the rectification study began, we completely abandoned leadership, and cadre study fell into a state of neglect.
    After reading Comrade Xiao Erwen's criticism, we immediately convened a meeting of responsible persons of relevant units to study specific measures to strengthen cadre political study: First, each unit should, in accordance with the spirit of the criticisms from the masses published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on March 22 and April 12 regarding the neglect of current affairs study, and the editor's notes, examine the current affairs study situation in their own units, and ideologically recognize the importance of leading current affairs study; Second, designate personnel cadres in each unit, together with party, Youth League, and trade union organizations in each unit, to jointly lead newspaper reading; Third, set aside one or two cadre study sessions each week to discuss current affairs issues; Fourth, establish a regular system of monthly tests and meetings to report on progress in order to check and solve problems in current affairs study.

### 北京市公共卫生局召集会议  研究加强干部时事学习办法

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市公共卫生局召集会议研究加强干部时事学习办法
    编辑同志：四月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了萧尔文同志对我们的批评，这一批评是完全正确的。过去我们对所属各单位干部的时事和政治学习一向不够重视，缺少领导，有时虽有布置，却没有检查；特别是在整风学习开始后，我们便完全放弃了领导，干部学习随着陷入自流状态。
    我们看到萧尔文同志的批评后，立即召集有关单位负责人开了会，研究了加强干部时事学习的具体办法：一、各单位应根据三月二十二日和四月十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载的群众对忽视时事学习的批评和编者按语的精神，检查本单位时事学习情况，并从思想上认识领导时事学习的重要性；二、指定各单位人事干部，会同各单位党、团、工会等组织，共同领导读报工作；三、每周要抽出一两次干部学习时间，讨论时事问题；四、建立每月测验一次及会议汇报一次的经常制度，以便检查并解决时事学习中的问题。
