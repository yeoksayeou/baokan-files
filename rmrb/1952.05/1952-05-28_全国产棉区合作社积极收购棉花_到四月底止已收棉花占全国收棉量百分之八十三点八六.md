Cooperatives in Major Cotton-Producing Areas Actively Purchase Cotton
	By the End of April, Cotton Purchased Accounted for 83.86% of the National Cotton Purchase Volume

Since accepting the state's commission last year to purchase cotton, cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas across the country had purchased 83.86% of the national purchase volume by the end of April this year. Cooperatives purchased cotton according to plan, reducing the possibility of private merchants抢购 (qiǎnggòu, panic buying) and inflating cotton prices, and promptly supplied the needs of yarn factories, basically stabilizing cotton prices. In the process of purchasing cotton, cooperatives in various regions grasped reasonable cotton-grain price ratios and fully supplied cotton farmers with needed living materials and means of production. Through pre-purchase and actual purchase, they were not only able to complete the planned purchase numbers, but also improve cotton quality. According to materials from the Fiber Inspection Institute of the Central Textile Industry Ministry, the national average moisture content of cotton in November 1950 was 10.99%, which decreased to 9.68% in the same month of 1951; the average impurity content in 1950 was 2.44%, which averaged 1.03% in 1951. This is of great significance for saving state funds and improving the quality of industrial products.

In the work of purchasing cotton, cooperatives, relying on the leadership of Party and government organs and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, created a method of collective cotton sales. This method not only simplified procedures, saved cotton farmers' labor, improved cotton quality, and reduced difficulties during inspection, but also educated farmers, allowing them to experience the benefits of collective operation from vivid facts, and enhanced their enthusiasm for participating in cooperative mutual aid organizations.

At present, cotton farmers in various regions still have a certain amount of cotton waiting to be purchased, and the work of purchasing wheat is about to begin. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives is urging cooperatives at all levels in cotton-producing areas to seize the cotton purchasing work and strive to basically complete the 1951 cotton purchasing task by the end of June. At the same time, they are organizing forces to carry out wheat purchasing work.

    全国产棉区合作社积极收购棉花
    到四月底止已收棉花占全国收棉量百分之八十三点八六
    全国各产棉区合作社自去年接受国家委托，收购棉花，到今年四月底止，已收棉花占全国收购量百分之八十三点八六。合作社按照计划收购棉花，减少了私商抢购和哄抬棉价的可能，及时供应了纱厂的需要，基本上稳定了棉价。各地合作社在购棉过程中，掌握了合理的棉粮比价，充分供应棉农需要的生活资料和生产资料，通过预购，进行收购，不但可以完成计划收购的数字，同时可以提高棉花质量。据中央纺织工业部纤维检验所材料，一九五○年十一月份全国棉花平均含水量为百分之一○点九九，一九五一年同月降低至百分之九点六八；一九五○年平均含杂量为百分之二点四四，一九五一年平均为百分之一点○三。这对节省国家资金，提高工业产品的质量，都有极大的意义。
    合作社在收购棉花工作中，依靠党政机关的领导和广大农民的积极性，创造了集体售棉的办法。这种办法，不但简化了手续，节省了棉农的劳动力，提高了棉花质量，减少了检验时的困难，而且教育了农民，使他们从活生生的事实中，体验到集体经营的好处，提高了参加合作互助组织的积极性。
    目前，各地棉农手中还有一定数量的棉花等待收购，而收购小麦工作也即将开始。全国合作总社正督促产棉区各级合作社，抓紧收棉工作，争取在六月底基本上完成一九五一年度收棉任务，同时，组织力量进行收麦工作。
