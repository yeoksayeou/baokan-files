    The French People Fight for Peace
    By Faqi, Chairman of the French Peace Council

    Throughout the various stages of their history, all nations have encountered the same disasters, engaged in the same struggles, and achieved the same victories. When I saw the grand and magnificent May Day parade in Beijing, the Chinese people appearing before my astonished eyes like a joyous river, I was reminded of this truth.

    Just ten days ago, our National Peace Council in Paris unanimously and enthusiastically approved the letter I brought to Beijing addressed to the Chinese people and government. Ten days separate your victory and our struggle; and our struggle is also simultaneously a victory.

    Although we have not yet succeeded in rescuing Henri Martin from prison, we have seen new segments of public opinion joining the action to demand his release, supporting our just claim that the cruel war in Vietnam must be stopped.

    The endless stream of corruption and lies forces us to engage in constant explanatory work; in factories, urban neighborhoods, and villages, our peace committees work tirelessly: they unite men and women of differing opinions under the same strong will; they receive the full support of the Communist Party, and they are gradually creating a common program that conforms to the wishes of the French people.

    In Bordeaux, in the center of France, the sense of being occupied by the United States is heavily felt everywhere; this conflicts with the sentiment of national independence and autonomy; it causes dissatisfaction among farmers whose fields are requisitioned to build barracks and airfields.

    In Lyon, as in the north of France, the textile industry is severely hit by unemployment: various discriminatory measures imposed on French commerce by American rule are paralyzing our economy.

    The standard of living is decreasing day by day.

    American imperialism finds some French industrial and commercial giants who control the government as its pillars of support; it is the working class that suffers from this political trickery.

    The exorbitant taxes levied to prepare for war, and the dirty war in Vietnam, which costs the French people more than 1 billion francs every day, weigh heavily on taxpayers, and we are about to point out to these taxpayers that our struggle for peace is closely related to the struggle for prosperity. The rearmament of Germany has aroused the anger of the entire nation. Our country has been forced to resist the same enemy three times in seventy-five years. Our struggle against the rearmament of Germany and for the realization of peaceful relations with that country is exactly the same as the Chinese people's struggle against the rearmament of Japan.

    The people of our country are extremely sensitive to reactionary measures that endanger freedom. The government, under the influence of the United States, in order to suppress the people's growing voices of discontent, is intensifying its sabotage of all the fruits of republican victories and all the fruits of liberation: destroying or prosecuting newspapers, restricting speeches in parliament, prohibiting demonstrations, prosecuting trade union leaders, dismissing civil servants, and so on.

    It is in this environment of war preparation that we decided this year to call on the French people to participate in regional conferences, while taking into account the specific circumstances of each region. In Bordeaux, two thousand people gathered to resist American occupation; in Lyon, twenty thousand French people demanded the restoration of trade with the East; in Nancy, twenty thousand people opposed the rearmament of Germany; in Limoges, countless farmers responded to our call to resist the heavy taxes levied because of the war.

    Under special circumstances, through mass testing and based on many obvious and sometimes tragic examples, our arguments gain strong content. From this we realize that if events in many regions and under many special circumstances become universally unbearable, they will not be tolerated.

    The new situation of the French peace struggle is linked to its great revolutionary tradition, which once enabled us to seize the right moment to prepare for the overthrow of the monarchy. When the people and the middle class were writing "grievance books," they were actually preparing for the French Revolution.

    Sometimes, people say to us: "Let France remain as it is, because this 'old country' is ultimately a beautiful country." My answer is: there are no old countries; when the power of the people is liberated, all countries will become young again.

    Speaking of this, I want to talk about the greatest commemoration I saw with my own eyes in Beijing, which I will never forget—the May Day celebration of 1952. You have not only given land to the peasants, justice to the working class, and independence to your country; you have also given the youth the right and enthusiasm to dance the Yangko.

    The Yangko is the equivalent of our French four-person dance, which also involves dancing hand in hand. In the districts and villages of our big cities, there are also many beautiful squares waiting for our happiness-loving people to sing and dance there. The ancestors of our republic planted elm and linden trees in these squares for the next generation, and they called these trees "Trees of Liberty."

### 法国人民为和平而战斗

    法国人民为和平而战斗
    法国和平理事会主席  法奇
    在他们的各个不同阶段的历史中，所有各国人民都遭遇到同样的灾难，从事同样的斗争和获得同样的胜利。当我在北京看到“五一”节壮大无比的游行队伍，在使我感到惊奇的眼前现出着像一条欢乐的洪流般的中国人民时，我就想念着这个真理。
    仅仅十天以前，在巴黎举行的我们全国和平理事会，一致热烈欢呼地通过了我带到北京来的致中国人民及政府书。你们的胜利和我们的斗争之间相隔十天；而我们的斗争同时也是胜利。
    虽然我们还没有做到把亨利·马丁从监牢里抢救出来，可是我们看到了在要求释放他的行动中，已添了一些新表示意见的阶层，起来拥护我们必须停止残酷的越南战争的正义主张。
    层出不穷的腐败和谎言，迫使我们不得不从事一种经常的解释工作；在工厂里、市区街坊里和村庄里，我们的和平委员会不懈怠地工作：它们把见解不同的男人和女人在同一坚强的意志下联合起来；它们得到共产党全力的支持，它们正在逐渐地作出一个符合于法国人民愿望的共同纲领。
    在波尔多、在法国的中部，到处都沉重地感受到被美国占领的意味；这是与民族独立自主的情感相抵触的；这引起农民不满，他们的田地被征收了去建造兵营和飞机场。
    在里昂，像在法国的北部一样，纺织工业中遭受了失业问题的严重打击：美国统治强加在法国商业上的各种歧视的措施使我们的经济陷于麻痹状态。
    生活水平一天一天地降低。
    美帝国主义找出一些利用着伙计掌握政权的法国工商业巨子来，作为它的支柱点；身受这种政治把戏之害的就是工人阶级。
    为了准备战争而征收的苛税以及每天需要法国人民耗费十亿法郎以上的越南肮脏战争，沉重地压在纳税者的身上，我们正要向这些纳税者指明我们为和平的斗争是与争取繁荣的斗争息息相关的。重新武装德国激起了全国人民的愤怒。我们这个国家在七十五年间，三次被迫抵抗同一敌人。我们反对重新武装德国，争取与这个国家实现和平关系的斗争，与中国人民反对重新武装日本的斗争是完全相同的。
    我们国家的人民对于危害自由的反动措施是极其敏感的。在美国影响下的政府，为了压制人民日益增长的不满的呼声，变本加厉地对所有一切共和政体的胜利果实，一切解放的胜利果实，进行破坏：摧残或控告报纸，限制议会中发言，禁止示威游行，对工会领袖兴讼迫害，对公务人员的罢免等等。
    就是在这个备战的环境中，我们决定了在今年号召法国人民参加各区域举行的大会，我们同时顾到每个地区的特殊情况。在波尔多，两千人集会反抗美国占领；在里昂，两万法国人要求和东方恢复贸易；在南锡，两万人反抗重新武装德国；在里摩日，无数农民响应我们的号召反抗因战争而征收的重税。
    在一种特殊情况之下，经过群众性的测验和依据许多明显的有时也是惨痛的实例，使我们的论证获得强有力的内容。由此我们认识到，如果在许多地区和许多特殊情况之下的一些事件，普遍地成为忍无可忍的时候，它是不会被人们容忍过去的。
    法国和平斗争的新局面连系到它伟大的革命传统，这种传统曾经使我们掌握着适当的时机准备王室的倾覆。人民和中产阶级在编写“诉苦书”的时候，实际上就是在从事法国大革命的准备。
    有时，人们对我们这样说：“让法兰西保持着它的原状罢，因为这个‘古老的国家’终归是一个美丽的国家啊。”我的答复是：没有什么古老的国家，当人民的力量获得解放的时候，一切国家都将重新变得很年轻。
    说到这里，我要谈谈我在北京亲眼所看见的那使我衷心永远不会忘记的一个最大的纪念——一九五二年的“五一”节。你们不仅把土地给了农民，把公道给了工人阶级，使你们的国家获得了独立；你们还给了青年们以扭秧歌的权利和热情。
    秧歌就等于我们法国的四班舞，那也是手牵着手穿来穿去地跳着。在我们大都市的各区和村庄里，也有许多美丽的广场在等待着我们爱好幸福的人民到那里去载歌载舞。我们共和国的祖先为了下一代，在这些广场上种了些榆树和菩提树，他们把这些树叫作“自由之树”。
    一九五二年五月二日，在北京。（附图片）
