    Letter to the Editor:
    The Council meeting of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers held in Vienna unanimously adopted the resolution on the "Investigation Report of the Investigation Team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers on the War Crimes Committed by the US Army in Korea and the Facts of the Use of Bacteriological Weapons in Korea and China," as well as important documents such as the "Letter to Legal Workers of the World," the "Letter to the United Nations Security Council," and the "Letter to the United Nations Disarmament Commission." This has undoubtedly made an important contribution to the cause of defending world peace. The "Letter to Legal Workers of the World" is a solemn appeal to us legal workers, and we are willing to endorse it wholeheartedly and enthusiastically.
    The investigation team dispatched by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers conducted on-the-spot investigations at the Korean front and rear, as well as in Northeast China, collected a large amount of evidence of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism, and published investigation reports based on these ironclad evidences respectively; undeniable, ironclad facts prove that the American murderers have indeed been and are continuing to wage bacteriological warfare against the people of China and Korea; and once again confirmed that the American aggressors have used chemical weapons in Korea, which are also prohibited by international law. This shocking crime of violating international conventions by the US aggressors is absolutely unforgivable. All justice-loving and peace-loving people in the world must sanction the US aggressors.
    As stated in the "Letter to Legal Workers of the World," "The law in our hands must become a torch, forcing evil to retreat." We legal science researchers of New China are determined to fight against the brutal crimes of US imperialism, and are willing to unite more closely with legal workers all over the world, take strong actions, safeguard the law, uphold justice, and fight to the end to completely eliminate the bacteriological warfare of the US aggressors.

    热烈拥护国际民主法律工作者协会理事会的庄严号召
    编辑同志：在维也纳召开的国际民主法律工作者协会理事会会议一致通过了关于“国际民主法律工作者协会调查团关于美国军队在朝鲜犯的战争罪行以及在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器事实的调查报告”的决议，以及“告世界法律工作者书”、“致联合国安全理事会书”、“致联合国裁减军备委员会书”等重要文件。这对于保卫世界和平的事业无疑已作了重要的贡献。而“告世界法律工作者书”，对于我们法律工作者来说，更是一个庄严的呼吁，我们愿意衷心热烈地拥护。
    国际民主法律工作者协会派遣的调查团，在朝鲜前线和后方，以及我国东北地区进行了实地调查，收集了美帝国主义进行细菌战的大量罪证，并且根据这些铁的罪证，分别发表了调查报告；无可辩驳的，铁的事实，证实了美国杀人犯确曾而且还在继续着对中朝人民进行细菌战；并再次证实了美国侵略者在朝鲜使用了同样为国际公法所禁用的化学武器。美国侵略者这种骇人听闻的违反国际公约的罪行，是绝对不能宽恕的。全世界爱好正义爱好和平的人民，必须对美国侵略者进行制裁。
    正如在“告世界法律工作者书”中所提出的一样，“掌握在我们手中的法律，必须成为火炬，迫使罪恶后退。”我们新中国的法律科学研究者，坚决向美帝国主义的残暴罪行进行斗争，并愿和全世界法律工作者更紧密地团结一起，采取有力行动，为维护法律，申张公义，为彻底消灭美国侵略者的细菌战斗争到底。
