    Ding Ling's "Spring in China" Expresses the Thousand Words in People's Hearts

    Editor's Note: After Comrade Ding Ling's "Spring in China" was published in this newspaper on May 1st, we received letters from Li Ying, Hongniao, Yang Yin, Guang Tian, Meng Ya, etc. They believe that "this is a beautiful prose"; "it expresses the thousands of words that have been accumulated in people's hearts for a long time." Now, we are publishing excerpts from these letters below:

    Reader Li Ying's letter stated: We believe that when our Soviet friends finish reading this article, they will feel the same way as we do: "China is heading towards brightness, towards collectivization, towards the direction indicated by Mao Zedong." At the same time, in this article, we deeply feel Comrade Ding Ling's infinite love for the motherland. She said, "Although white hairs have quietly crept onto my temples, I feel like life has just begun." Indeed, when we finished reading this article, we felt even happier. Therefore, we collectively recited this article at the evening party on the eve of the "May Fourth" celebration.

    Yang Yin, Guang Tian, and Meng Ya wrote: "Spring in China" has encouraged us, giving us full confidence and vitality to create a happier tomorrow. Hongniao's letter stated: After reading "Spring in China," I have gained infinite strength in my studies. I also want to "serve as a small soldier under Mao Zedong's command" and strive for the construction of the New China.

    丁玲作“中国的春天”一文说出人们心底的千言万语
    编者按：丁玲同志写的“中国的春天”，五月一日在本报发表以后，我们收到李婴、红鸟、杨尹、光天、萌芽等的来信，他们认为“这是一篇美丽的散文”；“说出了人们久已积存在心底的千言万语”。现在把这些信摘要如下：
    读者李婴的信中说：我们相信，苏联朋友们读完这篇文章的时候，也会和我们一样地感到“中国正在奔向光明，奔向集体化，奔向毛泽东所指示的方向。”同时，在这篇文章里，我们亲切地感到丁玲同志对祖国的无限热爱。她说：“虽然在我的鬓边，已经悄悄地爬上了白发，但我却觉得好像生命才开始。”真的，我们读完这篇文章时，更感到自己的幸福了。因此，我们在“五四”前夕的晚会上集体朗诵了这篇文章。
    杨尹、光天、萌芽来信说：“中国的春天”一文鼓舞了我们，使我们有充分的信心与活力来创造更幸福的明天。红鸟的信中说：读了“中国的春天”一文后，我在学习上增加了无限的力量。我也要在“毛泽东的麾下，充当一名小小的兵士”，为新中国的建设而奋斗。
