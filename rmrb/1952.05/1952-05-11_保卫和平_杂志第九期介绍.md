An introduction to the ninth issue of "World Peace" Magazine

The Chinese edition of the ninth issue of "World Peace" magazine, the official publication of the World Peace Council, has been published. In his editorial, "Public Opinion and the Defense of Peace," the magazine's president, Pierre Cot, pointed out that public opinion plays a very important role in resolving international issues. Whether our struggle for peace can be victorious depends on the extent to which we mobilize wavering elements to oppose war. Under the current international situation, regardless of differing opinions and views, as long as they are part of the forces for peace, or are beneficial to peace in some way, we should unite them, win them over, and cooperate with them. Only in this way can we mobilize a broader stratum to oppose war, and only then can we prove our strength and our sincerity. We will make war recede.

This issue contains an article entitled "Latin America's Struggle for Independence," which details the widespread dissatisfaction of Latin American countries under American control with the United States. They have realized that they are only a dumping ground for American goods and a supplier of raw materials, and they do not even have the possibility of negotiating prices. The economies of these countries are gradually collapsing under the rearmament policies of the "Atlantic Overlords." They have begun to fight against the "Atlantic Overlords." There is also a correspondence entitled "How the French People Treat the American Occupation Army," which vividly describes the rampant tyranny of the American occupation army in France and the resulting resentment of the French people. An article titled "World Events of the Past Month" analyzes the situations in Korea, Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

Ma Yinchu, a famous Chinese economist and professor at Peking University, published an article entitled "The Brilliant Achievements of New China's Economic Construction and the Broad Prospects for the Development of International Trade." In addition to elaborating on the brilliant achievements New China has made in economic construction over the past two years, it focuses on explaining that China, which has always loved peace, is willing to establish reasonable and equal trade relations with all countries.

This issue also contains articles such as "Science and Longevity" and "Painless Childbirth in the Soviet Union," allowing people to see how much happiness science can bring to mankind if it can be used for peaceful purposes.

    “保卫和平”杂志第九期介绍
    世界和平理事会的机关刊物“保卫和平”杂志中文版第九期已经出版。该刊社长皮尔·戈特在“舆论与保卫和平”的社论中指出：舆论对于国际问题的解决，作用是非常大的。我们争取和平的斗争能否获得胜利，就看我们发动犹豫分子起来反对战争的工作做到什么程度。在目前的国际形势下，不管各人的见解和观念如何不同，只要他们是和平力量的一分子，或在某一方面对和平有利，我们就应该团结他们，争取他们，与他们合作。这样，我们才能动员更广泛的阶层起来反对战争，也才能证明我们的力量和我们的诚意。我们将使战争后退。
    本期载有“拉丁美洲争取独立”一文，详述了在美国控制下的拉丁美洲各国普遍对美国不满。他们已意识到他们只是美国商品的倾销市场和原料供给者；而自己连商订价格的可能都没有。这些国家的经济在“大西洋霸主”们的扩军政策下，已日渐崩溃。他们已经开始和“大西洋霸主”斗争。另有“法国人民怎样对待美国占领军”一篇通讯，生动地描写了美国占领军在法国的横行霸道和由此引起的法国人民的愤恨。“一月来的世界大事”一文，分析了朝鲜、西欧、中东和北非的局势。
    中国著名的经济学家、北京大学教授马寅初发表了题为“新中国的经济建设辉煌成就与发展国际贸易的远大前途”一文，除阐述新中国两年多以来在经济建设上获得了辉煌的成绩外，并着重说明一向爱和平的中国愿与各国建立合理的平等的贸易关系。
    本期还登载了“科学与延年益寿”、“没有痛苦的分娩在苏联”等文章，使人们可以从此看到：科学如果能用于和平事业，将会给人类带来多少幸福。
