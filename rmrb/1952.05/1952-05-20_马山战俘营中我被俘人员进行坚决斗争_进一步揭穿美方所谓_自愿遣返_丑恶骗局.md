Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 19th: News from U.S. sources regarding the Masan POW camp further exposes the ugly truth of the U.S. side’s "voluntary repatriation" deception.

To facilitate the forced retention of a large number of our captured personnel, the U.S. side set up new POW camps near Busan, Masan, and other places on the Korean mainland at the end of April, dispersing and isolating our captured personnel who were originally detained on Geoje Island. At the time, U.S. invasion army spokesman Hickman shamelessly declared: "Those who request repatriation are placed in prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island off the coast of South Korea, and those who say they do not wish to be sent back are sent to prisoner-of-war camps on the mainland." (U.S. Information Service, Munsan, April 25th) However, in less than a month, Hickman's lies were immediately exposed. According to a United Press report from Geoje Island on the 16th, a U.S. military officer at the Masan POW camp said: "The next riot by communist prisoners is likely to occur in a new POW camp holding prisoners who have already indicated they do not wish to be repatriated."

Fearing that the truth about the Masan POW camp would be revealed, Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, has ordered reporters to be barred from visiting POW camps on the Korean mainland, including the Masan POW camp. Commander-in-Chief of the invading forces in Korea, Clark, even threatened that if the Masan POW camp on the mainland "becomes disturbed," he would call in the U.S. 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment, which was recently transferred to Geoje Island, to suppress it. The fact that our captured personnel who had "indicated they did not wish to be repatriated" are now about to "riot" completely proves that the U.S. aggressors' so-called "expression of unwillingness to be repatriated" by our captured personnel is a completely shameless lie.

These POW camps set up by the U.S. side on the mainland are entirely controlled by special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs. A report on the 16th by an Associated Press reporter who visited a POW camp near Busan fully proves this point. This reporter visited James, the person in charge of the POW camp. James admitted that the prisoner-of-war camp was being "maintained" with the help of the so-called "Anti-Communist Youth Corps." But even under such strict control by the U.S., Chiang, and Rhee gangs, our captured personnel are still waging a resolute struggle. James also admitted that on "May Day," special agents had "increased the number of sentry posts to prevent trouble." And the news about the Masan POW camp revealed by the U.S. side itself further proves that the will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation to their motherland can never be subdued by any violence or terror.

Now, people can see very clearly: not only are our captured personnel on Geoje Island demanding to return to their motherland, but also our captured personnel in POW camps on the South Korean mainland, who were forcibly labeled as "unwilling to be repatriated" by the U.S. side, are also opposing the persecution by the U.S. side and demanding repatriation. The U.S. side's so-called "screening results" have not only been completely proven to be illegal, but have also been completely proven to be fabricated. The U.S. aggressors' cruel persecution and bloody massacres can never subdue our captured personnel in Masan or other POW camps, but only further expose the truth of the U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and the hideous face of the murderers who are full of "humanitarianism" to the people of the world.

    马山战俘营中我被俘人员进行坚决斗争
    进一步揭穿美方所谓“自愿遣返”丑恶骗局
    【新华社开城十九日电】美国通讯社所透露出来的关于美方马山战俘营的消息，进一步暴露了美方的“自愿遣返”骗局的丑恶真相。
    美方为了便于强行扣留我方大批被俘人员，曾于四月底在朝鲜大陆上的釜山、马山等地附近设置了新的战俘营，将原来被拘留在巨济岛上的我方被俘人员加以分散和隔离。当时美国侵略军发言人希克曼曾经无耻地宣称：“那些要求被遣返的人们都被放在南朝鲜海岸外的巨济岛上的俘虏营中，那些说他们不愿被送回的人们则被送到大陆上的俘虏营里。”（美国新闻处汶山四月二十五日电）但是不到一个月，希克曼的鬼话立刻就被揭穿了。据合众社巨济岛十六日电透露：马山战俘营的一个美国军官说：“共产党俘虏的下一次暴动可能在拘留已经表示不愿遣返的俘虏的某一新战俘营中发生。”
    由于害怕马山战俘营的真相泄露出来，美军第八军军长范佛里特已经下令禁止记者访问包括马山战俘营在内的朝鲜大陆上的战俘营。侵朝军总司令克拉克并且扬言：如果大陆上的马山的战俘营“发生骚动”，就要调用最近被调到巨济岛上去的美国第一八七空运步兵团前去镇压。曾经“表示不愿遣返”的我方被俘人员现在居然要“暴动”，这就完全证明了美国侵略者的所谓我方被俘人员“表示不愿遣返”，完全是一个无耻的谎言。
    美方设在大陆上的这些战俘营，是完全由蒋介石、李承晚匪帮的特务分子控制的。曾经访问过釜山附近某战俘营的美联社记者十六日的报道完全证明了这一点。这个记者访问了该战俘营的负责人杰姆斯。杰姆斯供认，俘虏营是由所谓“反共青年团”帮助他“维持”秩序的。但是即使在美、蒋、李匪帮的这样严密控制之下，我方被俘人员仍然进行着坚决的斗争。杰姆斯也供认在“五一”节那天，特务分子们曾“加布岗哨，以防乱事发生”。而美方自己所透露出来的关于马山战俘营的消息，更证明我方被俘人员要求遣返祖国的意志绝对不是任何暴力与恐怖所能屈服的。
    现在，人们可以完全清楚：不仅是巨济岛上的我方被俘人员要求返回祖国，而且在南朝鲜大陆上战俘营中的我方被俘人员，他们曾被美方强称为“不愿遣返”的，同样也反对美方迫害，要求遣返。美方的所谓“甄别结果”，不但已完全证明是非法的，而且已完全证明是捏造的。美国侵略者的残酷迫害与血腥屠杀，决不能使马山或其他战俘营中的我方被俘人员屈服，而只是在全世界人民面前进一步暴露出美方所谓“自愿遣返”的真相，和满口“人道主义”的杀人凶犯的狰狞面目而已。
