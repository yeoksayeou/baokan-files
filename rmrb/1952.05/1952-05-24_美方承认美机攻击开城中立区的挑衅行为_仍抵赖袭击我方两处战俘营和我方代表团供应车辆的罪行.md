Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 23rd: U.S. Liaison Officer Colonel Murray, due to the conclusive evidence from the joint investigation and under our side's strong protest, had to formally admit on the 23rd the serious provocative incident of U.S. military aircraft attacking the Kaesong neutral zone on May 14th. However, at the same time, Murray groundlessly denied the serious incidents of U.S. aircraft attacking our Changsong POW camp on May 4th and 5th, attacking the Kangdong POW camp on May 11th, and attacking the supply vehicles of our delegation on May 12th.

　　In a memorandum to our Chief Liaison Officer Colonel Zhang Chunshan, U.S. Liaison Officer Murray described the May 14th incident as a "mistaken attack" and lightly "expressed regret." Sources here pointed out that in this incident, U.S. aircraft dropped more than 20 flares over Kaesong and strafed at low altitude for as long as 55 minutes. Since the U.S. side admits that it was done by American aircraft, it cannot deny that it was a deliberate provocation and cannot evade the serious responsibility of attempting to undermine the negotiations.

　　Regarding the Kangdong and Changsong incidents, Murray completely denied them in another memorandum. However, the fact that four prisoners of war in the Kangdong POW camp were seriously injured by U.S. aircraft is an ironclad fact. Similarly, the fact that Li Dongzhu, a staff member of our delegation, was killed by U.S. aircraft machine guns on May 12th is also an ironclad fact, but Murray insisted that U.S. aircraft had not carried out this attack.

　　Denials and sophistry cannot exonerate the U.S. side from serious responsibility; on the contrary, they only further expose the cunning and rogue nature of the U.S. side.

    美方承认美机攻击开城中立区的挑衅行为
    仍抵赖袭击我方两处战俘营和我方代表团供应车辆的罪行
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美方联络官穆莱上校，因为双方共同调查，证据确凿，并在我方严厉抗议之下，二十三日不得不正式承认五月十四日美国军用飞机攻击开城中立区的严重挑衅事件。但同时穆莱却毫无道理地抵赖美机五月四、五两日攻击我方昌城俘虏营，五月十一日攻击江东俘虏营及五月十二日攻击我方代表团供应车辆的严重事件。
    在致我方首席联络官张春山上校的一份备忘录中，美方穆莱上校把十四日的事件说成是“错误的攻击”，而只轻描淡写地“表示遗憾”。此间人士指出：在这一事件中，美机在开城投掷照明弹二十余枚，低飞扫射达五十五分钟之久。美方既承认这是美国飞机干的，就无法否认其为蓄意挑衅，就无法逃避其企图以此破坏谈判的严重责任。
    关于江东及昌城事件，穆莱在另一份备忘录中完全抵赖。但是，江东俘虏营四个战俘被美机打得身受重伤，却是铁的事实。同样地，五月十二日我方代表团工作人员李东洙被美机机枪打死，也是铁的事实，但穆莱却硬说美机没有作过这一攻击。
    抵赖与诡辩绝不能开脱美方的严重责任，相反地，只是更暴露了美方的狡诈无赖而已。
