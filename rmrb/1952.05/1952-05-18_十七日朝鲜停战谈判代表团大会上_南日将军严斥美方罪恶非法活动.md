Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 17th: At the meeting of the delegations of both sides of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on the 17th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, pointed out: The other side, under the guise of "voluntary repatriation," attempted to detain our captured personnel to use as cannon fodder. This one-sided and unreasonable plan has been thoroughly bankrupt in the face of overwhelming facts, and in the face of facts that even the officers of the other side's prisoner-of-war camps have had to admit. However, the other side's newly appointed prisoner-of-war camp officer openly tore up the other side's guarantee to our captured personnel, stating that the other side would continue its inhumane treatment, continue forced "screening," and continue to force our captured personnel to serve as cannon fodder. General Nam Il sternly pointed out: The other side must bear full responsibility for all the criminal and illegal activities taken by the other side against our captured personnel. Our side has resolutely rejected the other side's April 28th plan aimed at detaining our captured personnel, and our side's reasonable compromise plan of May 2nd is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue.

    南日将军严斥美方罪恶非法活动
    【新华社开城十七日电】十七日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：对方假借“自愿遣返”之名，企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的片面的无理的方案，已在压倒的事实的面前，在对方战俘营长官也不得不承认的事实面前，宣告彻底破产。而对方新任战俘营长官却公开撕毁对方对我方被俘人员的保证，表示对方将继续其非人道的待遇，继续强迫“甄别”，继续强迫我方被俘人员充当炮灰。南日将军严词指出：对于对方对我方被俘人员所采取的一切罪恶非法活动，对方必须担负全部责任。我方已断然拒绝了对方以扣留我方被俘人员为目的的四月二十八日方案，我方五月二日的合理折衷方案是解决战俘问题的唯一的合理基础。
