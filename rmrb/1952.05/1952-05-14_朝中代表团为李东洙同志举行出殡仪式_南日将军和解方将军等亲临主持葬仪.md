Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th - The delegation of Korea and China held a funeral ceremony today for Comrade Li Dong-shu, a staff member who was sacrificed in an attack by American aircraft. General Nam Il and General Xie Fang personally presided over the funeral ceremony and helped carry the coffin for burial. More than 300 people, including staff members of the delegation, representatives from all walks of life in Kaesong City, and representatives of the Korean People's Army, attended the funeral. People buried their comrade-in-arms, who sacrificed himself for the cause of peace, on a grassy hillside in Kaesong City with grief and indignation.

Representatives of the Korean-Chinese negotiation delegation, representatives of the people from all walks of life in Kaesong City, and representatives of the Korean People's Army delivered memorial speeches at the funeral ceremony. They unanimously pointed out that Comrade Li Dong-shu was shot and killed by military aircraft of the American side, who violated the agreement by continuously strafing with machine guns while traveling with the supply vehicles of the Korean-Chinese delegation from Pyongyang to Kaesong on the 12th. They resolutely stated: We must accuse American imperialism of this perfidious behavior of repeatedly undermining the agreement by despicable means to the people of the world. We will continue to fight to the end for the cause of peace desired by the people of the world with an indomitable spirit.
