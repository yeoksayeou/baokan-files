To the Editor: Ning Yubao, the Party Branch Secretary of Ningjiagou Village, Daxindian District, Penglai County, Shandong Province, is a bad element who has lost his stance and cannot distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. The villagers have reported his many evil deeds to the district leadership several times. Not only did the district leaders fail to seriously deal with these matters, but they also promoted Ning Yubao to the position of township general branch committee member, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

Ning Yubao's mistakes are very serious. He abused his authority to shield the counter-revolutionary Ning Yupu; he colluded with secret agents, puppet Bao chiefs, landlords, and local bullies to plot against Ning Wenyong and Ning Yuji; he personally led gambling and liquor brewing; he developed his mistress into a Communist Party member and promoted her to branch committee member; he embezzled and accepted bribes, stole the fruits of the masses' struggle, and his character was extremely vile.

The district leaders were well aware of Ning Yubao's evil deeds. District Chief Shan Xingji knew very well that there were many problems in Ningjiagou, but instead of actively dealing with them, he said, "If Ning Yubao is dealt with, the work in the village will come to a standstill." District Party Secretary Li Yanming also adopted an attitude of shielding and condoning Ning Yubao. The masses reflected, "You can't twist your arm against your thigh. Ning Yubao has a good relationship with the district party secretary. It's useless for everyone to report their opinions to the district. Whether you are right or wrong, they listen to Ning Yubao anyway."

The Penglai County People's Government has also shown a bureaucratic work style in this matter. The county government has many materials on this matter and decided to investigate and deal with it, but it has not done so seriously. Therefore, this lawless element is still at large.

I request the Penglai County People's Government and the CCP Daxindian District Committee to handle this matter and make a public self-criticism.　Fan Zhendong

Editor's Note: The Party and government leaders of Penglai County and Daxindian District should quickly handle the bad element Ning Yubao and make a self-criticism of the erroneous attitude previously adopted.

　　蓬莱县领导机关应处理坏分子宁玉宝
    编辑同志：中共山东省蓬莱县大辛店区寗家沟村党支部书记寗玉宝，是个丧失立场，敌我不分的坏分子。关于他的许多罪恶事实，村里的农民曾数次向区的领导方面反映，区的领导干部不但不认真严肃地处理这些事，反而提拔寗玉宝为乡总支委员，因此，引起群众极大不满。
    寗玉宝的错误是很严重的。他利用职权包庇反革命分子寗玉璞；他勾结特务、伪保长、地主、恶霸等阴谋陷害寗文永和寗玉玑；他亲自领导赌博、烧酒；他把他的姘妇发展为共产党员，并提拔为支部委员；他贪污受贿，盗窃群众斗争果实，品质恶劣到了极点。
    区里的领导干部对寗玉宝的罪恶行为是知道得很清楚的。区长单兴基明明知道寗家沟问题很多，不但不积极处理，反说：“如果把寗玉宝处理了，村里工作就要停顿。”区委书记李岩明对寗玉宝也同样采取了包庇、姑息的态度。群众反映说：“胳膊拧不过大腿，寗玉宝和区委书记有感情，大家有意见反映到区里也没用，有理也没理，反正人家听寗玉宝的话。”
    蓬莱县人民政府在这个问题上也表现了官僚主义作风。县人民政府对这件事已有许多材料，曾决定要进行了解和处理，可是并没有认真去做，因此，这个不法分子仍逍遥法外。
    我要求蓬莱县人民政府和中共大辛店区委处理这件事，并公开作检讨。　范振东
    编者按：蓬莱县和该县大辛店区的党政领导方面应迅速处理坏分子寗玉宝，并对以前所采取的错误态度作检讨。
