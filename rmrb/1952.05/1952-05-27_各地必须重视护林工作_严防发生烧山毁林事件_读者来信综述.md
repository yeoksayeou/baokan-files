    All Regions Must Emphasize Forest Protection Work and Strictly Prevent Incidents of Burning Mountains and Destroying Forests
    --Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, many readers' letters have reflected that incidents of burning mountains and destroying forests, damaging national forest resources, are constantly occurring in various regions.
    The main reason for forest fires is that the leading organs in some areas do not pay enough attention to forest protection and fire prevention. Reader Wang Qifeng wrote in a letter: "Because the leading cadres of the Fourth Engineering Area of the Southern Anhui Forest Products Company only care about completing the logging tasks and do not pay attention to forest protection work, the Yujiashan forest area under its management suffered a major fire on April 17. In the Yujiashan forest area, because logging workers do not clean up the forest land on weekdays and arbitrarily discard branches and bark, which helps the burning of trees, this fire spread to 4,000 mu. After the fire broke out, the county head, the head of the Construction Section of the Commissioner's Office, and the director of the Public Security Bureau personally led more than 4,000 people, including mass cadres and armed personnel, to rush to rescue and put out the fire." Readers Zhang Jianxun and Zhang Wenyan wrote in a letter: "Since the beginning of spring, eleven mountain fires have occurred in Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, burning 189 square kilometers of forest, one iron car, and countless firewood and grass. Most of these mountain fires were caused by the masses burning wasteland and burning paper during tomb sweeping, but the reason for this is that cadres in Gannan County, from top to bottom, do not pay attention to forest protection and fire prevention. Because burning wasteland is strictly prohibited by repeated instructions from the higher-level government, but Gannan County only made general appeals when carrying out this work and did not make specific arrangements for implementation."
    Some newly land-reformed areas have experienced forest fires. Readers Tang Fangyao and comrades from the Shaoyang Zijiang Peasant News Agency in Hunan wrote in a letter:
    "Recently, forest fires have occurred continuously in Wugang, Dongkou, Xinhua, Xinning, Chengbu, Longhui, Xinshao, and Shaoyang in the Shaoyang area of Hunan Province. The main cause of the fires is the conspiracy and sabotage of unlawful landlords and counter-revolutionaries. For example, on April 15, the landlord Yu Sanmei in Yangshi Township, Chengbu County, secretly set fire to burn more than 5,000 fir trees on Shan Zhushan. Landlord Chen Suzhen in Taigong Township, Dongkou, set fire to burn more than 600 seedlings to death. Now the Shaoyang Prefectural Production Office has issued a circular requiring all counties and districts to strictly prevent the continued occurrence of fires."
    Protecting national forest resources and strictly preventing mountain fires is an extremely important task that leading party and government organs at all levels in forest areas must do well. However, the leading organs in the aforementioned regions have not yet paid enough attention to this issue, resulting in the loss of national forest resources. Readers unanimously requested them to examine and review, and immediately strengthen forest protection and fire prevention work.

    各地必须重视护林工作  严防发生烧山毁林事件
    ——读者来信综述
    最近，不少读者来信反映各地不断发生烧山毁林损害国家森林资源的事件。
    某些地区的领导机关不重视护林防火工作，是发生山林火灾的主要原因。读者汪奇峰来信说：“由于皖南林产公司第四工程区的领导干部只顾完成采伐任务，不注意护林工作，致使它所管理的余家山林区在四月十七日发生大火。余家山林区，因为平日采伐工人不整理林地，随意抛弃树枝树皮，助长了林木的燃烧，使这次火灾绵延达四千亩。火起后，县长、专署建设科长和公安处长等亲自率领群众干部、武装人员四千多人赶往抢救，才把大火扑灭。”读者张建勋、张文言来信说：“黑龙江甘南县入春以来已发生山火十一起，烧毁森林一百八十九平方公里、铁车一台、柴草不计其数。这些山火大多是群众烧荒、上坟烧纸引起的，但追究原因，则是甘南县干部从上到下都不重视护林防火工作所造成的。因为烧荒是上级政府再三指令严禁的，但甘南县在进行这一工作时，只作了一般号召，并未具体布置，贯彻执行。”
    有些新完成土地改革的地区发生山林失火事件。读者唐芳耀、湖南邵阳资江农民报社同志来信说：
    “湖南邵阳专区的武冈、洞口、新化、新宁、城步、隆回、新邵、邵阳等地最近连续发生森林失火事件。发生火灾的原因，大部是由于不法地主、反革命分子的阴谋破坏。如城步县羊石乡地主禹三妹在四月十五日偷偷放火烧毁杉竹山的杉树在五千棵以上。洞口太公乡地主陈苏贞放火烧死树苗六百多棵。现在邵阳专署生产办公室已发出通报，要求各县区严格防止火灾的继续发生。”
    保护国家森林资源，严防发生山火，是林区各级党政领导机关必须作好的一件极为重要的工作。但上述地区的领导机关对这一问题还没有重视起来，致使国家森林资财遭受损失。读者来信一致要求他们检查和检讨，并立即加强护林防火工作。
