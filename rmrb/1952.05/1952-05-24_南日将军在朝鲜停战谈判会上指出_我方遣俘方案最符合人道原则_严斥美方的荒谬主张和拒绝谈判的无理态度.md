Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 23rd: At the plenary session of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation on the 23rd, our chief representative General Nam Il pointed out: On the only issue hindering the Korean armistice – the prisoner of war issue – our May 2nd proposal guarantees that prisoners of war on both sides can return home to live peaceful lives, while the opposing side's April 28th proposal insists on detaining our prisoners of war to use as cannon fodder. People all over the world can clearly see that only our proposal truly conforms to humanitarian principles, truly respects the rights of prisoners of war, and is the only rational basis for resolving the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. At the suggestion of the opposing side, the plenary session adjourned until May 27th. General Nam Il made the following statement at the meeting on the 23rd:

	Your side's claim to detain our prisoners of war and use them as cannon fodder has absolutely nothing to do with humanitarian principles or individual rights. Only our proposal, which allows prisoners of war on both sides to return home and live peaceful lives, is reasonable, truly in line with humanitarian principles, and truly respects the rights of prisoners of war. Shortly after the discussion of the prisoner of war issue began, your side, citing the reason that neither side should gain military advantage from the exchange of prisoners of war, refused to repatriate all of our prisoners of war. In order to eliminate your excuse, our side suggested that the commanders of both sides guarantee that all their prisoners of war, after being released and repatriated, would engage in peaceful lives and no longer participate in war actions. In fact, your side's purpose in opposing the complete repatriation of our prisoners of war is not this, but rather that you yourselves intend to detain our prisoners of war. Facts have proved that your treatment of our prisoners of war is a complete violation of humanitarian principles. Your prisoner of war camp commanders have openly admitted to your inhumane treatment of our prisoners of war and the fact that you are rearming our prisoners of war. Your purpose in attempting to detain our prisoners of war is to send them to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee clique to serve as cannon fodder for your expansion of the war. Our proposal guarantees that prisoners of war on both sides can live peaceful lives, but your side insists on detaining our prisoners of war as cannon fodder. Your proposal advocates war, and our proposal advocates peace. On what basis can you say that your proposal is in line with humanitarian principles? It is very clear that your proposal is a complete violation of humanitarian principles. Only the principle of guaranteeing that prisoners of war on both sides can live peaceful lives is truly a humanitarian principle. The most basic right of a prisoner of war is to be released and repatriated after the armistice. However, in order to achieve your goal of detaining our prisoners of war, you have fantastically put forward the fallacy of "voluntary repatriation." You attempt to explain to the people of the world that it is the will of the prisoners of war not to want to return home to live peaceful lives, but this is impossible to imagine. How can there be people in the world who do not want to return home to live peaceful lives? That is contrary to human nature, that is impossible, that is not the will of the prisoners of war, that is only the wish of a few warmongers on your side. It is precisely because you want to implement a plan that is completely contrary to human nature and violates the will of prisoners of war that you have to resort to various violent actions to achieve your goals. This deception of yours can only deceive some people when you can stop our prisoners of war from speaking and let you act as their spokespersons. However, our prisoners of war have spoken, and the just struggle of our prisoners of war on Koje Island has exposed your deception. Currently, your side is adopting open and direct terrorist methods to suppress the resistance of our prisoners of war, so that you can forever be their spokespersons and refuse repatriation on their behalf. But your suppression is ultimately impossible to succeed. The will of our prisoners of war to demand repatriation is unshakable. In the Busan prisoner of war camp, only three out of 1,600 of our prisoners of war were forced to obey your orders under your armed repression. Doesn't this prove that even your open and direct repression cannot achieve your goals? What you say about not being able to repatriate our prisoners of war with bayonets is a deceptive lie. The fact before the people of the world is that you are forcibly detaining our prisoners of war with bayonets. So, from what point can it be said that your claim is a claim that respects individual rights? Your proposal advocates the separation of prisoner of war families, while our proposal advocates family reunions for prisoners of war. It is very clear that no sober person can doubt that only our proposal, which allows prisoners of war on both sides to return home and reunite with their families, is a proposal that truly respects the rights of prisoners of war. Your insistence on detaining our prisoners of war as cannon fodder directly undermines humanitarian principles and the rights of prisoners of war. Your insistence on this proposal is by no means for any moral principles; there is no morality in your proposal at all. Only our proposal, which allows prisoners of war on both sides to return home and live peaceful lives, is a reasonable proposal for resolving the prisoner of war issue. Your side refuses to use this proposal as the basis for resolving the prisoner of war issue and adopts an attitude of refusing to negotiate and refusing to talk at this meeting. This can only lead us to one conclusion: for ulterior motives, your side is unwilling to see a swift realization of the Korean armistice, and your side is planning to reject the armistice negotiations.

    南日将军在朝鲜停战谈判会上指出
    我方遣俘方案最符合人道原则
    严斥美方的荒谬主张和拒绝谈判的无理态度
    【新华社开城二十三日电】二十三日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：在阻碍着朝鲜停战的唯一问题——战俘问题上，我方五月二日的方案保证双方被俘人员回家过和平生活，而对方四月二十八日方案坚持扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰。全世界人民都能清楚地看出，只有我方方案是真正符合人道原则、真正尊重战俘权利的方案，是解决战俘遣返问题的唯一合理基础。代表团大会在对方建议下，休会到五月二十七日。南日将军在二十三日大会上发言如下：
    你方企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的主张是怎样也扯不上人道原则和个人权利的。只有我方使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的方案才是入情入理、既真正符合于人道原则、又真正尊重战俘权利的方案。在战俘问题开始讨论后不久，你方就藉口双方不得从战俘交换中得到军事利益的理由，拒绝全部遣返我方被俘人员。我方为了取消你方这个藉口，建议双方司令官保证其全部被俘人员在释放和遣返后，从事和平生活，不再参加战争行动。其实你方反对全部遣返我方被俘人员的目的并不在此，而是在于你方自己企图扣留我方被俘人员。事实证明，你方对我方被俘人员的待遇是彻底违背人道的。你方战俘营长官公开承认了你方对我方被俘人员的非人道待遇及重行武装我方被俘人员的事实。你方企图扣留我方被俘人员的目的是要把他们送给台湾蒋介石匪帮和李承晚集团充当你方扩大战争的炮灰。我方方案保证双方被俘人员过和平生活，但你方却坚持扣留我方被俘人员当炮灰。你方方案主张战争，我方方案主张和平。你们可以根据什么说你方方案是符合人道原则呢？很清楚，你们的方案是彻底违反人道原则的。只有保证双方被俘人员过和平生活的原则才是真正的人道原则。战俘的最基本的权利就是在停战后被释放和遣返。但你方为了达到扣留我方被俘人员的目的，却异想天开地提出什么
    “自愿遣返”的谬论。你们企图向全世界人民说明不愿回家过和平生活是战俘的志愿，但这是不可能设想的。世界上如何会有人不愿回家过和平生活呢？那是违背人性的，那是不可能的，那不是战俘的志愿，那只是你方少数好战分子的愿望。正是因为你们要执行一个完全违反人性、强奸战俘意志的计划，你们不能不借助于各种暴力行动来达到你们的目的。你们这个骗局只有当你们能够叫我方被俘人员不讲话，让你们充当他们的代言人的时候，才有可能欺骗一些人。但我方被俘人员讲了话，巨济岛我方被俘人员的正义抗争揭穿了你们的欺骗。目前你方正采取公开直接的恐怖办法来镇压我方被俘人员的反抗，好让你们永远做他们的代言人代他们拒绝遣返。但你们的镇压究竟是不可能成功的。我方被俘人员要求遣返的意志是不可动摇的。釜山战俘营中一千六百名我方被俘人员只有三个人在你方的武装弹压之下，被迫服从了你们的命令，难道这还不能说明你们公开直接的弹压也不能达到你们的目的吗？你们说什么你们不能用刺刀尖遣返我方被俘人员，那是骗人的鬼话。摆在世界人民面前的事实，却是你方正在用刺刀尖强迫扣留我方被俘人员。这样，从那一点可以说你们的主张是尊重个人权利的主张呢？你方方案主张拆散战俘家庭，我方方案主张战俘家人团聚。很清楚，没有一个清醒的人可以怀疑，只有使双方战俘得以回家和家人团聚的我方方案才是真正尊重战俘权利的方案。你方坚持扣留我方被俘人员当炮灰的主张是直接地破坏了人道原则和战俘权利的。你方坚持这个方案决不是为了什么道德原则，你们的方案中根本就没有什么道德。只有我方使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的方案，才是入情入理的解决战俘问题的方案。你方拒绝以这个方案为解决战俘问题的基础，在这个会上采取拒绝协商、拒绝谈判的态度。这只能使我们得到一个结论，你方为了不可告人的目的，不愿意朝鲜停战迅速实现，你方是在有计划地拒绝停战谈判。
