The "Full Load, Over-Axle, Five Hundred Kilometers" campaign is being enthusiastically launched on railways nationwide. In April, 29% of the nation's railway cargo locomotives completed and exceeded 500 kilometers per day, exceeding the prescribed traction weight by over 340 million ton-kilometers. The China Changchun Railway (CCR) achieved the best results. The CCR Bureau averaged 460.4 kilometers per day for all locomotives in April, exceeding the prescribed traction weight by a total of over 81 million ton-kilometers. The Sujiatun, Wafangdian, and other locomotive depots under the jurisdiction of the CCR Bureau regularly maintain the majority of their locomotives running 500 kilometers every day. The Shanghai Railway Bureau also continuously sets new records. For example, the Shen Boguang locomotive team of Locomotive No. 582 at the Nanjing Locomotive Depot, with the close cooperation of various departments, created a new national record of 1,244 kilometers per day on April 30th. The average daily locomotive kilometers for the entire bureau have increased from 406.9 kilometers in September of last year to 432 kilometers in April of this year. The Tianjin Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau achieved an average of 521.8 kilometers per day for all locomotives in April of this year. The Mao Zedong locomotive team, a national locomotive banner, of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Branch, pulled three heavily loaded freight trains in one day on April 25th, hauling 7,698.1 tons more than prescribed, equivalent to saving 3.2 locomotive trips between Fengtai and Tianjin. After the Jinan Railway Bureau adopted the locomotive "tight schedule" created by dispatchers at the Bengbu Branch, the locomotive utilization efficiency of the entire bureau generally improved. The average daily locomotive kilometers for the entire bureau increased from 347 kilometers in September of last year to 413 kilometers.

After the Tianjin Railway Branch workers achieved a great victory in the "Three-Anti" campaign, they studied the advanced experiences of Soviet railway work and vigorously launched the "Five Hundred Kilometers" campaign. From April 1st to April 25th, 46.8% of the branch's operating locomotives completed 500 kilometers per day.

After the "Three-Anti" campaign, the sense of ownership of the country among the workers of the Tianjin Railway Branch was strengthened, and their enthusiasm for learning and promoting advanced Soviet experience was greatly increased. After the workers of various locomotive depots implemented the locomotive operating method of "opening the steam valve wide and raising the handle high," Locomotive No. 1542 of the Guye Locomotive Depot created a maximum technical speed of 61.2 kilometers. The workers of each train inspection station of the Tianjin Vehicle Depot universally implemented the "serpentine operation method," conducting in-depth inspections of the underside of the cars. At the same time, the inspection and repair workers implemented a division of labor, strengthening specialization, thereby shortening the vehicle inspection time, accelerating vehicle turnover, and improving the quality of maintenance. After the Tianjin Station implemented the shift plan system and improved the technical operation schedule, the operating efficiency has been significantly improved. In March, the freight car stopping time at the station was shortened by 30.8% compared to the plan, and the transfer time was shortened by 11.6% compared to the plan. In order to ensure the realization of the shift plan system, the station also implemented the Li Xikui shunting method, shortening the train disassembly time and formation time. In addition to learning from advanced Soviet experience, some workers have created new working methods. For example, the parallel shunting and loading operation method created by the Cheng Zhongping team of the Xinhe Station has played a significant role in shortening the technical operation time of the station. In the past, the average shunting and loading time for each train was 30 minutes. After the implementation of the Cheng Zhongping parallel shunting and loading operation method, it has been shortened to 15.6 minutes.

The mutual connection and close cooperation among the various relevant business units and staff of the Tianjin Railway Branch, and the implementation of joint labor, have also played a great role in promoting the "Five Hundred Kilometers" campaign. For example, the dispatching office, locomotive depot, and station have signed mutual guarantee contracts. The dispatching office guarantees the supply of locomotives to prevent train delays, the station guarantees good formation quality, and the locomotive depot guarantees more hauling and faster running. Dispatchers use "dispatch notices" to establish a contact system with drivers. Drivers learn about the running situation of trains ahead and behind en route in the "dispatch notice," so they are clear about the situation when running the train, which greatly improves the train travel speed. Due to the mutual cooperation and joint labor of the various relevant units, the locomotive turnaround time has been shortened.

    全国各铁路广大职工
    普遍展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动
    四月份货物机车已有百分之二十九完成和超过五百日车公里
    满载、超轴、五百公里运动正在全国各铁路热烈展开。四月份全国铁路货物机车中已有百分之二十九的机车完成和超过五百日车公里，超过规定牵引重量达三亿四千余万吨公里。其中中长铁路成绩最好。中长铁路管理局四月份全局所有机车平均日车公里在四百六十点四公里，超过规定牵引重量共达八千一百多万吨公里。中长铁路局管辖的苏家屯、瓦房店等机务段经常保持全段大多数的机车每天都跑五百公里。上海铁路管理局也不断创造新纪录。如南京机务段五八二号机车沈波光包车组，四月三十日在各部门密切配合下，创造了一千二百四十四日车公里的全国新纪录。全局机车平均日车公里已从去年九月份的四百零六点九公里提高到今年四月份的四百三十二公里。天津铁路管理局天津分局今年四月份全局机车达到平均日车公里五百二十一点八公里。北京铁路分局丰台机务段的全国机车旗帜毛泽东号包车组在四月二十五日一天之内连拉三趟重载货物列车，较规定多拉七千六百九十八点一吨，等于在丰台天津间节省三点二趟列车的运用机车。济南铁路管理局采用蚌埠分局调度员创造的机车“紧密运行图”后，全局的机车运用效率普遍提高。全局平均日车公里从去年九月的三百四十七公里提高到四百十三公里。

    天津铁路分局职工在“三反”运动中取得伟大胜利后，学习苏联铁路工作先进经验，大力开展“五百公里”运动。自四月一日起至四月二十五日止，该分局已有占运用机车百分之四十六点八的机车完成五百日车公里。
    经过“三反”运动后，天津铁路分局职工国家主人翁的感觉加强，因而学习和推进苏联先进经验的积极性大为提高。各机务段职工推行了“大开汽门，高提手把”的机车操纵方法后，古冶机务段一五四二号机车创造了六十一点二的最高技术速度。天津车辆段各列检所职工普遍推行了“蛇行作业法”，深入车底进行检查，同时检查、修理工人实行分工，加强了专业化，因而缩短了检车时间，加速了车辆周转，并且提高了检修质量。天津车站推行了班计划制度、健全了技术作业表后，作业效能已显著提高。三月份货车停站时间较计划缩短了百分之三十点八，中转时间较计划缩短了百分之十一点六。为了保证班计划制的实现，该站又推行了李锡奎调车法，缩短了列车解体时间和编组时间。除学习苏联先进经验外，有些职工创造了新工作法。如新河车站程钟平小组创造的甩挂平行作业法，对于缩短车站技术作业时间起了很大作用。过去平均每列车一次甩挂时间为三十分，推行程钟平甩挂平行作业法后，已缩短至十五点六分。
    天津铁路分局各个有关业务单位和工作人员互相连系，密切配合，实行联合劳动对于推动“五百公里”运动也起了很大作用。如调度所、机务段和车站订立了互保合同。调度所保证供应机车，不使列车晚点，车站保证编组质量好，机务段保证多拉快跑。调度员用“调度通告签”和司机建立连系制度，司机在“调度通告签”中知道途中前后列车运行情况，因此跑车时心中有数，大大提高了列车旅行速度。由于各有关单位互相配合，联合劳动，因此缩短了机车折返时间。
