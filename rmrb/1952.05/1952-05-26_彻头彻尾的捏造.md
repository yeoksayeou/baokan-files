The Korean armistice negotiations have fallen into a dangerous stalemate due to the American side's stubbornly unreasonable insistence on its so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle. The American side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "implementation of screening" violate the Geneva Convention and international law, which is well known. Even more shameless is that the American side keeps saying that only 70,000 of our captured personnel are willing to be repatriated, and claims that this is the "result of screening." However, the American side's own words and deeds completely and self-exposingly prove that the American side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening results" are utter fabrications and fictions.

When the American side put forward the absurd and unreasonable figure of only repatriating 70,000 of our prisoners of war on April 19, it claimed that this was the result of "screening" 173,000 of our captured personnel. According to Hickmann, a spokesman for the so-called United Nations Command, this was the result of "the United Nations Command investigating the opinions of approximately 173,000 prisoners of war and detained civilians during the secret meetings recess from April 4 to 19" (Reuters, Tokyo, April 25). The Tokyo American military radio station even said on April 26 with great fanfare: "The United Nations Command has a total of 173,635 Communist soldiers and civilians. Recent screening indicates that only 70,100 of this total want to return to their side." However, a France-Presse report from Munsan on April 26 revealed another version of Hickmann slapping himself in the face, proving that the American side's so-called "investigation" was simply absurd. According to this report, Hickmann revealed that "only 70,000 of the 116,000 people who needed to vote had voted." Of course, the so-called "voting" here is just one of the American side's despicable lies. In fact, it is just a euphemism for the American side's use of beatings and massacres to conduct screening. However, on this point, this expert in lying carelessly revealed his own weakness. Since, according to the American side's spokesman, "only 70,000 of the 116,000 people who needed to vote had voted" by April 25, what is the basis for the American side's claim on April 19 that only 70,000 of our prisoners of war were "voluntarily repatriated"? Can the American aggressors, who are accustomed to sophistry, still justify themselves? What is the basis for saying that only "70,100" of our captured personnel are willing to be repatriated? The American side's slip-ups don't stop there. Since the just struggle of our captured personnel on Geoje Island exposed the bloody inside story of the American side's so-called "screening," the American side, which had long declared that it had conducted so-called "screening" of all our captured personnel, shamelessly declared that the "screening" of our captured personnel had not yet been completed. According to an Associated Press report from Seoul on the 14th, American officer Hunter in the American prisoner-of-war camp admitted that "many people" among the prisoners of war on Geoje Island "have never been questioned." Bonner, the person in charge of the American prisoner-of-war camp, also confessed that he would conduct "screening" of our captured personnel on the island in the future. An internal telegram from the Associated Press in Tokyo on the 14th also revealed that "the most reliable news" the agency "received" was that there were still about 10,000 people being "screened." Kerrson's confession also proved that the American side's so-called "investigation" and "screening" was to force our captured personnel to express their unwillingness to be repatriated through torture and abuse. All this proves that the American side's claim that the "result of screening" all our captured personnel is that only 70,000 people are willing to be repatriated is just an utter lie to cover up its sinister conspiracy to detain a large number of our captured personnel.

The barbaric act of the American side slaughtering our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp on May 20, who resolutely demanded repatriation, further exposed the bloody inside story of the American side's so-called "screening" of all our captured personnel. When the American side put forward its unreasonable plan to detain more than 100,000 of our prisoners of war, Hickmann, a spokesman for the so-called United Nations Command, claimed: "When the investigation is completed, those who request to be repatriated are placed in prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island off the coast of South Korea, and those who say they do not want to be sent back are sent to prisoner-of-war camps on the mainland." (US Information Agency, Munsan, April 25) The American side also claimed that it had transferred these so-called "people who did not want to be sent back" to six prisoner-of-war camps, including Busan. However, in less than a month, our captured personnel used their heroic struggle to show their unyielding desire to be repatriated to their motherland, forcing the American aggressors to slap themselves in the face and admit that these captured personnel, who they had once listed as "non-communist prisoners," were actually "fanatical communist prisoners." After the incident, Bostick, the person in charge of the American Busan prisoner-of-war camp, admitted on the 22nd that our captured personnel in the seven camps of this prisoner-of-war camp had not been "screened" before, and when our captured personnel resisted the American side's forced "screening" of them, American infantry carried out a bloody massacre on them. An Associated Press dispatch from Busan on the 21st also revealed: When the American side slaughtered our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp on the 20th, "residents of nearby villages heard the prisoners of war singing military songs and heard them shouting: 'Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!' 'Long live Kim Il-sung!'" The American side's crime of forcibly detaining our captured personnel has been completely exposed, and the American side's so-called plan based on the results of "screening" our captured personnel is even more proved to be absurd, completely unreasonable, and without basis.

The American side's so-called "screening" has been proved to be a synonym for bloody persecution, and the American side's so-called plan to only repatriate 70,000 of our captured personnel based on the fact that it has conducted "screening" of all our captured personnel has also been proved to be a shameless scam that is completely unreasonable and cannot justify itself.

### 彻头彻尾的捏造

    彻头彻尾的捏造
    朝鲜停战谈判已因美方蛮横无理地坚持其所谓“自愿遣返”原则而陷于危险的僵局。美方的所谓“自愿遣返”和“实行甄别”之违反日内瓦公约和国际公法是人所共知的，而更其无耻的是：美方口口声声说我方被俘人员中只有七万人愿意遣返，还说什么这是“甄别的结果”，但美方自己的言行，却完全不打自招地证明了美方的所谓“自愿遣返”和“甄别结果”是彻头彻尾的捏造和虚构。
    美方在四月十九日提出只遣返我方七万战俘的蛮横无理的数字时，曾经宣称这是对十七万三千名我方被俘人员进行了“甄别”的结果。据所谓联合国军发言人希克曼的说法，这是“联合国军在四月四日到十九日秘密会议休会期间，调查了大约十七万三千战俘和被拘平民的意见”（路透社东京四月二十五日电）的结果。东京美国军中电台在四月二十六日还煞有介事地说：“联合国军手上共有十七万三千六百三十五名共方兵士和平民。最近甄别表示，这总数中只有七万零一百名要回到他们方面去。”但是法新社汶山四月二十六日的消息，却透露了希克曼自打嘴巴的另一种说法，证明美方这种所谓“调查”根本就是无稽之谈。据这个消息说，希克曼透露说：“需要投票的十一万六千人中只有七万人已举行了投票。”当然这里所谓的“投票”不过是美方的卑鄙谎言之一种，实际上，它不过是美方用毒打和屠杀来进行甄别的代名词。可是，就在这一点上，这个撒谎专家也不小心地露出了自己的马脚。既然到四月二十五日为止，照美方发言人的说法，“需要投票的十一万六千人中只有七万人举行了投票”，那么美方在四月十九日就提出所谓“自愿遣返”的我方战俘只有七万人，有什么根据呢？惯于狡辩的美国侵略者难道还能再自圆其说吗？所谓只有“七万零一百名”我方被俘人员愿意被遣返，又有什么根据呢？美方露出来的马脚还不止此。自从巨济岛上我方被俘人员的正义斗争拆穿了美方所谓“甄别”的血腥内幕之后，早就宣称对我方全部被俘人员进行了所谓“甄别”的美方，竟然又不要脸地宣称对我方被俘人员的“甄别”尚未完毕。据美联社汉城十四日消息，美方战俘营中的美国军官亨特尔承认，巨济岛上的战俘中“有许多人从未受到询问”。美方战俘营负责人波纳也供认将来还要对岛上的我方被俘人员进行“甄别”。美联社东京十四日的内部电报也透露，该社“所得到的最可靠的消息”是：目前还有一万人左右在被“甄别”。柯尔生的供词还证明了美方的所谓“调查”和“甄别”，就是用酷刑和虐杀强迫我方被俘人员表示不愿遣返。这一切都证明了美方所谓对我方全体被俘人员进行“甄别的结果”只有七万人愿意遣返的说法，只是用来掩饰自己扣留我方大批被俘人员的罪恶阴谋的彻头彻尾的谎言。
    五月二十日美方屠杀釜山战俘营坚决要求遣返的我方被俘人员的野蛮行为，更加揭穿了美方所谓对我方全体被俘人员进行了“甄别”的血腥内幕。在美方提出其扣留我方十万以上战俘的无理方案时，所谓联合国军发言人希克曼曾经宣称：“当调查工作完毕后，那些要求被遣返的人们都被放在南朝鲜海岸外的巨济岛上的俘虏营中，那些说他们不愿被送回的人们则送到大陆上的俘虏营里。”（美国新闻处汶山四月二十五日电）美方并宣称已将这些所谓“不愿被送回的人们”移到釜山等六个战俘营中去。可是不到一个月，我方被俘人员就用自己的英勇斗争表明了要求遣返祖国的不屈意愿，迫使美国侵略者不得不自打嘴巴，承认这些曾经被他们列为“非共产党俘虏”的我方被俘人员，实际上都是“狂热的共产党俘虏”。在事件发生以后，美方釜山战俘营负责人波斯蒂克在二十二日承认这个战俘营的七个营场中的我方被俘人员以前都没有经过“甄别”，而当我方被俘人员抗拒美方对他们进行强迫“甄别”时，美国的步兵就对他们进行了血腥的屠杀。合众社釜山二十一日电还透露：在二十日美方屠杀釜山战俘营中我方被俘人员时，“附近乡村的居民听到战俘们唱军歌，并听到他们高声喊：‘朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！’‘金日成万岁！’。”美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪行至此暴露无遗，而美方所谓根据对我方被俘人员进行“甄别”的结果而提出的方案，也更其证明是荒谬绝伦的，完全没有道理的，没有根据的。
    美方的所谓“甄别”已经被证明了就是血腥迫害的代名词，而美方所提出的所谓根据对我方全部被俘人员进行了“甄别”而只遣返我方七万被俘人员的方案，也已经被证明了是毫无道理的，不能自圆其说的无耻骗局。（新华社开城二十五日电）
