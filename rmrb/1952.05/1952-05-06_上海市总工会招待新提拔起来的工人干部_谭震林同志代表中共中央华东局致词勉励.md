    Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Hosts Newly Promoted Worker Cadres
    Comrade Tan Zhenlin Delivers a Speech on Behalf of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau, Offering Encouragement
    On April 29th, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions held a grand reception to host newly promoted worker cadres from state-owned, public, and joint state-private factories throughout the city, congratulating and encouraging them to strive even harder for production and to strengthen national economic construction. A total of 1,036 new worker cadres attended, including 668 who were newly promoted after the "Three-Anti" campaign, and 368 who had been promoted before the "Three-Anti" campaign or after Liberation. Among the worker cadres newly promoted after the "Three-Anti" campaign, 55 were women, 26 were factory directors or deputy factory directors, 42 were section chiefs or station masters, and 530 were section chiefs or workshop directors.
    At the reception, Tan Zhenlin delivered a speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee's East China Bureau. He said: Boldly promoting outstanding workers to leadership positions is a major reform in the management of state-owned, public, and joint state-private factories in Shanghai in the three years since Liberation. Facts have proven that outstanding worker cadres who have been promoted to leadership positions are not only competent in their work and able to improve production, but also loyal to the cause of the people and fight for it with great enthusiasm. The work of promoting worker cadres is only just beginning, and in the future, we must promote outstanding workers more boldly and widely. In the future, we must not only have outstanding workers take on leadership roles in the administrative and technical departments of factories and enterprises, but also in the various departments of the People's Government. Tan Zhenlin strictly criticized the erroneous idea that factory directors and engineers must be intellectuals from petty-bourgeois or bourgeois families. He said: This is a completely upside-down argument.
    Tan Zhenlin encouraged the newly promoted worker cadres to maintain close ties with the masses, humbly learn from them, and bridge the gap between former staff and workers. This is a key to doing a good job and running factories well. Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, also delivered a congratulatory speech at the reception. He encouraged the newly promoted worker cadres to bravely take on new work, and instructed trade union cadres to specifically assist them, and to treat the cultivation and promotion of worker cadres as a regular task.
    The newly promoted worker cadres who spoke at the meeting unanimously agreed that they owe their glory today to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. They firmly stated that they would study diligently, rely on the masses, unite with technical personnel, and improve production even more. Dai Kedu, an old worker who was newly promoted to deputy factory director of the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, said excitedly: "I have been working for 33 years, and before Liberation, I lived like an animal. Today, we workers are truly masters, and we should be determined to create more wealth for the country." Liu Guanying, who was newly promoted to workshop director of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, said: "I will definitely repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their cultivation and education with practical actions to improve production."

    上海市总工会招待新提拔起来的工人干部
    谭震林同志代表中共中央华东局致词勉励
    上海市总工会在四月二十九日举行隆重的招待会，招待全市国营、公营和公私合营工厂里新提拔起来的工人干部，祝贺和鼓励他们更好地为搞好生产、加强国家经济建设而奋斗。到会的新工人干部共一千零三十六名，其中六百六十八名是“三反”运动后新提拔起来的，三百六十八名是“三反”运动前、解放后被提拔起来的。“三反”运动后新提拔起来的工人干部中，有五十五名是妇女，有二十六名是正副厂长，有四十二名是正副段长和站长，有五百三十名是科长和车间主任。
    在招待会上，谭震林代表中共中央华东局致词。他说：大胆提拔优秀工人到领导岗位上来，是解放后三年来上海国营、公营、公私合营工厂经营管理上的一次重大改革。事实证明：被提拔到领导岗位上来的优秀的工人干部，不仅能胜任自己的工作，把生产搞好，而且能忠实于人民事业，以高度的热情为人民事业而奋斗。现在提拔工人干部的工作还只是开始，今后必须更大胆更广泛把优秀工人提拔起来。今后，不仅要使优秀工人担负工厂企业中的行政部门和技术部门的领导工作，而且还要使他们担负人民政府各部门的工作。谭震林严格地批判了有些人认为厂长、工程师非小资产阶级或资产阶级家庭出身的知识分子来担任不可的错误思想。他说：这完全是颠到是非的说法。
    谭震林勉励新提拔的工人干部必须密切联系群众，虚心向群众学习，把过去职员和工人间的鸿沟填平。这就是作好工作办好工厂的一个关键。上海市总工会主席刘长胜也在招待会上致词祝贺。他一方面勉励新提拔的工人干部要勇敢地担负起新的工作，一方面指示工会干部必须具体地帮助新提拔的工人干部，并且把培养和提拔工人干部当成经常性的任务。
    在会上发言的新提拔的工人干部们，一致认为只有在毛主席、共产党的领导下，他们才会有今天的光荣。他们坚决表示要虚心学习，依靠群众，团结技术人员，把生产搞得更好。国营上海第二棉纺织厂新提拔为副厂长的老工人戴可都兴奋地说：“我做了三十三年工，解放前一直过着牛马生活，今天我们工人真的当家了，就应该有决心为国家创造更多的财富。”国营上海第一棉纺织厂新提拔为车间主任的刘冠英说：“我一定要以搞好生产的实际行动来报答毛主席、共产党对我的培养和教育。”
