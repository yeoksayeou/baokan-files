    Pay Attention to Checking Cotton Seedling Emergence to Ensure a Full Stand
    This year, around the Grain Rain solar term, most cotton-growing areas across the country experienced spring rains, which is a favorable condition for timely cotton sowing. However, some areas, in order to take advantage of the moisture after the rain, sowed prematurely, resulting in uneven emergence or yellow and weak young leaves after emergence. In addition, many areas have also experienced varying degrees of missing seedlings due to poor land preparation and sowing techniques, or the occurrence of diseases, pests, and drought. Ensuring a full stand of seedlings is very important for increasing cotton production. In normal years, the seedling deficiency rate in China's cotton-growing areas reaches more than 10%; if a full stand can be guaranteed, production can be increased by 10% on the existing basis. In order to "plant one mu of cotton and ensure one mu of seedlings," so as to lay the foundation for a bumper cotton harvest this year, all cotton-growing areas should regard checking, replanting, and protecting seedlings as an urgent task at present.
    1.  It is necessary to conduct a widespread and in-depth investigation of seedlings and replanting. In addition to leading the masses to complete sowing in a timely manner in a few areas where sowing has not yet been completed, in most areas where sowing has been completed, it is necessary to promptly focus on checking seedlings and replanting, and pay attention to the germination and emergence of cotton seeds. If it is found that a large number of sown cotton seeds have rotted, or that the cotton seedlings have been destroyed by cold winds and late frost after emergence, the masses should be mobilized to replant or resow with the same cotton seeds as before. This work in the northern cotton-growing areas should be completed as early as possible before the Lesser Fullness solar term.
    2.  Vigorously promote the transplanting of cotton seedlings. Experience has proven that in areas where cotton fields are missing seedlings and there is not enough time for replanting, transplanting cotton seedlings with soil before and after cotton seedling setting generally has a high survival rate and does not reduce yield. In 1950, Liaoxi Province promoted cotton seedling transplanting. According to incomplete statistics from more than 400 villages, a total of more than 580,000 seedlings were transplanted, with an average survival rate of about 90%. Many other areas have also achieved good results in promoting transplanting. This experience should be promoted.
    3.  When thinning and setting seedlings, maintain the appropriate density of cotton plants. The main reason why Liang Jiarui, a model cotton planter in Hebei Province last year, had a lower yield per unit area than Qu Yaoli was that he planted the cotton too sparsely. This year, some areas have stipulated local standards for dense planting of cotton fields. For example, Yuncheng Prefecture in Shanxi Province has set a standard for cotton density in the prefecture of 3,000 to 3,500 plants this year, and has widely explained and taught this in various technical training classes and mutual aid group representative meetings, which is very necessary. However, to truly achieve dense planting, it is necessary to implement it when thinning and setting seedlings on the basis of ensuring a full stand of seedlings. At present, some people still have doubts about dense planting, and many areas have not yet determined the planting density suitable for their local conditions. This will affect the dense planting of cotton this year. Therefore, all areas that have not stipulated the plant density of local cotton fields should quickly determine this based on the specific local conditions, and persuade the masses to maintain an appropriate density of cotton plants when checking, protecting, and setting seedlings.
    4.  Pay attention to extinguishing various diseases and insect pests. Cotton seedlings are very weak in resisting diseases and insect pests. Especially in rainy and insect-prone areas, close attention must be paid to the prevention and control of damping-off, anthracnose, and pests such as cutworms, and weeds should be diligently removed. After rain in the northern cotton-growing areas, the soil should be cultivated and seedlings hoed immediately to maintain soil moisture and increase soil temperature. In the southern cotton-growing areas, emphasis should be placed on drainage to ensure that cotton fields are not waterlogged or abandoned. In areas where cotton diseases and insect pests are relatively serious, emphasis should be placed on thinning seedlings in stages and setting seedlings later to avoid or reduce missing seedlings. According to past experience, the time around the wheat harvest is when pests such as cotton aphids begin to spread. To this end, all localities must lead the masses to check the preparation of medicines and equipment, raise vigilance, and ensure that "wherever insect pests occur, they are eliminated immediately."

### 注意检查棉苗出土情况，保证全苗

    注意检查棉苗出土情况，保证全苗
    今年谷雨前后全国大部棉区普降春雨，这是棉花适时播种的一个有利条件。但有些地区为了雨后抢墒，提前播种，因而播种期过早，出苗不齐，或出苗后幼叶黄瘦。另外，也有不少地区，由于整地和播种技术较差，或发生病虫、干旱等患害，也发生了不同程度的缺苗现象。保证全苗，对棉花增产的关系很大。我国棉区在通常年间缺苗率就达百分之十以上；假如能够保证全苗，就能在现有基础上增产百分之十。为了做到“种一亩棉花保一亩苗”，以奠定今年棉花丰产的基础，各棉区应把查苗、补苗和保苗工作作为目前的一项紧急任务。
    一、必须普遍深入地进行查苗补种。除在少数未完成播种的地区，应领导群众适时完成播种外，在大部播种已经完毕的地区，应及时抓紧查苗补种工作，注意棉籽发芽出苗情况。如发现播下的棉种大量腐烂，或棉苗出土后遭受冷风晚霜以致枯毁，应即发动群众，用原来同样棉种补种或重播。这项工作在北方棉区应尽可能争取在小满节前提早完成。
    二、要大力推行移植棉苗。经验证明，在棉田缺苗又不及补种的地区，在棉花定苗前后，连土移植棉苗，成活率一般很高，产量并不减少。一九五○年辽西省推行棉苗移植，据四百多个村不完全的统计，共移苗五十八万多株，平均成活率为百分之九十左右。其他不少地区推广移植也都有很好的成绩，这种经验应加以推广。
    三、在间苗定苗时，要保持棉株的适当密度。去年河北省植棉劳动模范梁家瑞单位面积产量不如曲耀离的主要原因，是把棉花种稀了。今年某些地区，规定了当地棉田密植的标准，如山西运城专区今年已定出本专区棉花密度应以三千株到三千五百株为标准，并在各种技术训练班及互助组代表会中普遍进行了讲解传授，这是很必要的。但要真正作到密植，还必须在保证全苗的基础上，在间苗定苗时贯彻实现。目前仍有少数人对密植怀疑，很多地区尚未根据本地情况定出适合当地的栽植密度。这都会使今年棉花的密植受到影响。因此，凡未规定本地棉田植株密度的地区，应迅速根据当地具体情况对这加以确定，在查苗保苗定苗时，说服群众保持棉株的适当密度。
    四、要注意扑灭各种病虫灾害。棉花在幼苗时期，对于病虫害的抵抗力很弱。特别是在多雨多虫地区，对立枯病、炭疽病以及地老虎等虫害，必须严密注意防治，并勤锄杂草。北方棉区每当雨后，应随即中耕锄苗，以保持土壤水分，增进地温；南方棉区要着重排水工作，经常做到棉田不涝不荒。在棉花病虫患害比较严重的地区，应强调分期间苗、晚些定苗，以避免或减少缺苗现象。根据历年经验，麦收前后正是棉蚜等害虫开始蔓延的时间。为此，各地必须领导群众，检查药械准备情况提高警觉，保证做到“虫害发生在那里，即时消灭在那里”。
