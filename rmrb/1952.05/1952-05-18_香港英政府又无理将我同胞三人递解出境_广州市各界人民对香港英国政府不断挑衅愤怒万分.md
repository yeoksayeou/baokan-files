    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 17th: The Hong Kong British government unreasonably deported Huang Jinhui, secretary-general of the Kowloon Dockyards Labour Union, Ma Hua, head of the organization department, and Mai Jiahhou, head of the organization department of the Hong Kong Seamen's Union, on May 15th. The three victims returned to Guangzhou on the same evening.
    In this persecution incident, the British police were even more tyrannical. Huang Jinhui and Ma Hua were unreasonably arrested by a British police officer leading twenty plainclothes special agents at the trade union dormitory at around 12 o'clock on the night of the 14th. On the way to the police station, British police officers and special agents Feng Ling, Zeng Xikang, and others punched and kicked them. At the Kowloon Police Headquarters, a group of British detectives and special agents surrounded and beat them until they fainted and fell to the ground. Ma Hua suffered injuries to his chest, ribs, waist, neck, and legs after being severely beaten. Huang Jinhui was covered in bruises, and his right ear was also deafened. At the same time, Mai Jiahhou was arrested by British police at the Seamen's Union. On the afternoon of the 15th, British special agents escorted the three to Luohu and deported them.
    People from all walks of life in Guangzhou are infinitely angry at the constant provocations of the Hong Kong British government and the brutal and beastly behavior of the British police and special agents, and believe that the Hong Kong British government must bear all responsibility for the consequences of such incidents.

    香港英政府又无理将我同胞三人递解出境
    广州市各界人民对香港英国政府不断挑衅愤怒万分
    【新华社广州十七日电】香港英国政府在五月十五日又无理将九龙船坞劳工联合会秘书部长黄锦辉和组织部长马华、香港海员工会组织部长麦家厚等三人递解出境。三位被迫害者已于同日晚上返抵广州。
    在此次迫害事件中，英方警察是更为横暴。黄锦辉和马华同在十四日深夜十二时许在工会宿舍被英国警官率领二十名的便衣特务人员无理逮捕。在押赴警署的途中，英国警官和特务冯领、曾锡康等对他们拳殴脚踢，到了九龙警察总署内，一群英方警探特务又将他们围殴，直至昏迷仆地。马华被毒打后，胸胁、腰、颈和腿等部都受了伤。黄锦辉遍体鳞伤，右耳也被打聋。与此同时，麦家厚在海员工会内被英警拘捕。延至十五日中午，英方特务人员将三人押解至罗湖驱逐出境。
    广州市各界人民对香港英国政府的不断挑衅和英方警察特务人员的残暴兽性行为，无限愤怒，认为香港英国政府必须对此类事件的后果承担一切责任。
