Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in People's Daily

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on February 8th criticizing our newspaper's Zhou Tiemin for not valuing public property. This criticism is correct. Zhou Tiemin was the director of the newspaper's management department. In March of the year before last, Zhou Tiemin used his position to deceive superiors and subordinates, using the name of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Cooperative to lend 800 "fold-into-real-units" to a private merchant, Yan Guoyuan, allowing the private merchant to engage in speculative activities. After this matter was discovered, he sold the oil drums stored by the private merchant to repay the debt, causing a loss of more than 800,000 yuan to the public. At that time, the newspaper was being reorganized, and the newly arrived responsible cadres did not understand the situation. Also, because they were eager to rectify the organization and improve work, the handling of this issue was not cautious enough.
    Zhou Tiemin also accepted bribes of hundreds of thousands of yuan from Yan Guoyuan. During the "Three-Anti" movement, he had received various forms of education and assistance. However, he still tried to downplay his mistakes to cover up his errors. Finally, under the pressure and exposure of the masses, he had no choice but to admit his mistakes. Zhou Tiemin has received an administrative punishment of dismissal from his post.

### 山东大众日报社节约检查委员会  处理了周铁民的受贿问题

    处理了周铁民的受贿问题
    编辑同志：人民日报二月八日刊载了读者来信，对我社周铁民不重视公家财产提出批评。这一批评是正确的。周铁民是本社经理部的主任。前年三月间，周铁民利用职权，瞒上欺下，假借浙江省委合作社名义，借给私商严国元八百个折实单位，任私商作投机倒把活动。这件事被发觉后，他就把私商所存油筒卖掉归还。使公家损失八十多万元。当时正遇报社整编，新来的负责干部不了解情况，又因急于整顿机关，改进工作，对这一问题处理不够慎重。
    周铁民还受过严国元几十万元的贿赂，“三反”运动中，已对他进行了各种教育和帮助。但他仍避重就轻地来掩盖自己的错误。最后在群众的斗争压力和揭发之下，他才不得不承认错误。周铁民在行政上已受撤职处分。
