    Tianjin Railway Administration Reviews Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Realignment Project
    Rationally Reduces Project Funds, Saving Over 20 Billion Yuan
    The Tianjin Railway Administration thoroughly reviewed the realignment project plan for the Shi (Shijiazhuang) - Tai (Taiyuan) Railway and rationally reduced project funds, resulting in a savings of 24.5 billion yuan for the country. The Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway realignment project is the largest basic construction investment for the administration this year. On the foundation of the victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the administration established a Basic Construction Department, focusing on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway realignment project to begin the work of reducing planned expenditures. Yi Qingyuan, Deputy Director of the Administration, and Lu Chengming, Director of the Basic Construction Department, personally went to the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway realignment project site to discuss the realignment project with workers and technicians; they also conducted in-depth on-site inspections of the construction site to revise certain unrealistic plans. This significantly reduced the planned project funds.
    The main methods for reducing planned funds were to reduce labor and material rates, utilize old materials and existing equipment, etc., based on the specific conditions grasped through in-depth on-site visits, combined with technical theory and advanced Soviet experience. For example, after the track-laying project plan was revised, it saved 11.2 billion yuan compared to the original plan. In terms of bridge, culvert, and tunnel engineering, the wing walls of bridges and culverts were changed to cheaper stone materials; the mixing ratio of cement and mortar was appropriately adjusted without reducing quality. Some materials were replaced with old materials; some bridges originally planned for reconstruction were changed to reinforcement projects. In this way, the bridge, culvert, and tunnel projects saved more than 5.3 billion yuan compared to the original plan. Other earthwork projects, housing construction projects, etc., were also modified according to specific circumstances.
    The administration's thorough review of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway realignment project plan and rational reduction of project funds set a good example of saving wealth for the country in basic construction projects. (Xinhua News Agency)

    天津铁路管理局审核石太路改线工程计划
    合理紧缩工程款项节省二百多亿元
    天津铁路管理局深入审核石（家庄）太（原）路改线工程计划，合理压缩工程款项，结果可为国家节省二百四十五亿元的财富。石太路改线工程是今年国家对该局基本建设投资比重最大的一项。该局在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，成立了基本建设处，以石太路改线工程为重点，着手压缩计划款额的工作。该局副局长易清源和基本建设处处长卢成铭，亲赴石太路改线工程处，和工人、技术人员研讨改线工程；并深入工地实地勘查，把某些不切合实际的计划加以修正。这样就大量压缩了工程的计划款项。
    压缩计划款项的主要方法是根据深入现场所掌握的具体情况，结合技术理论和苏联先进经验，核减工料率，利用旧料和原有设备等。如铺轨工程计划修正后，比原计划节省一百一十二亿元。在桥涵隧道工程方面，把桥涵翼墙改用价值便宜的石料；在不降低质量的原则下，适当调整了洋灰和砂浆的混合比例。有些材料用旧料代替；有些原拟重建的桥梁改为加固工程。这样，桥梁涵洞隧道等工程，就比原计划节省五十三亿多元。其他土石方工程、房屋修建工程等，也根据具体情况作了修改。
    该局此次深入审核石太路改线工程计划，合理压缩工程款项，在基本建设工程中树立了为国家节省财富的良好榜样。　（新华社）
