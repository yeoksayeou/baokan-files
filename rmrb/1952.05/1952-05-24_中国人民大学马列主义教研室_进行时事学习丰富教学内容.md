    Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University of China
    Conducts Current Affairs Study to Enrich Teaching Content
    To the Editor:  Studying the Party newspaper conscientiously is one of the important methods for us to strengthen the connection between theory and practice in teaching.
    Comrades of the undergraduate teaching group of the Marxist-Leninist Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University of China often flexibly connect the current domestic and international situation and the Party's policies in teaching to expound the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and actively guide students to use the principles of Marxism-Leninism to analyze various problems in the real struggle. For example, when talking about the international significance of the October Revolution, they connect it with the current balance of power between the two major camps in the world and the unprecedented growth of the peace and democracy camp. When talking about the Soviet government's promulgation of the Decree on Peace after the victory of the October Revolution, they connect it with Comrade Stalin's recent answers to questions from the editor of an American newspaper to explain the basis for the Decree on Peace, that is, starting from the possibility of coexistence between the capitalist and communist systems. This specifically and comprehensively explains the peaceful foreign policy that the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to. When discussing the nature of various wars and the reasons for the Soviet Union's victory in crushing foreign armed intervention and domestic counter-revolutionary forces in class, students are asked to take the Korean War as an example to analyze the nature of the war from both the enemy's and our sides. This can not only guide students to better understand this issue from the real struggle, but also strengthen their confidence in the inevitable victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    To connect theory with practice, it is necessary to first study and understand practical problems, and current affairs study is one of the most important methods to understand the real struggle and study the Party's guidelines and policies.
    Students read the People's Daily for at least one to two hours every day and conduct collective current affairs study under the leadership of the teaching group leader. Two students take turns every month to give systematic special current affairs reports in the group, and everyone discusses based on the content of the report. This semester, they have reported and discussed six special issues including the international situation, opposition to bacteriological warfare, Korean peace talks, ideological remolding of higher education teachers, Stalin's answers to questions from the editor of an American newspaper, and the International Economic Conference.
    This method of supplementing individual learning with collective learning has the following advantages:
    1. It can make up for the shortcomings of individual newspaper reading and enable everyone to understand the problem more deeply and comprehensively. For example, the recent discussion on the International Economic Conference not only made everyone clearly recognize the conditions for holding this conference, as well as its achievements and significance, but also realized its great significance for safeguarding world peace.
    2. Special reports and discussions have improved everyone's newspaper reading methods, so that comrades no longer read the news in isolation, but pay attention to studying the "ins and outs" of various major issues.
    3. The comrades who made the reports have all initially learned the methods of analyzing current affairs issues and organizing materials, and have opened the door to conducting special research. For example, when Comrade Zeng Zixia made a report on the ideological remolding of higher education teachers, she further understood the relationship between natural science and the superstructure as explained by Dr. Yudin when analyzing and criticizing the erroneous views of the bourgeoisie on so-called "supra-politics" and "supra-class."

    中国人民大学马列主义教研室
    进行时事学习丰富教学内容
    编辑同志：认真学习党报，是我们在教学当中加强理论和实际联系的重要方法之一。
    中国人民大学马列主义教研室本科教学组的同志们，在教学中经常灵活地联系当前的国内外形势和党的政策，来阐明马列主义的原则，主动地引导同学运用马列主义的原则，来分析现实斗争中的各项问题。如讲到十月革命的国际意义时，就联系到目前世界上两大阵营的力量对比与和平民主阵营的空前壮大。讲到十月革命胜利后苏联政府颁布和平法令时，就联系斯大林同志最近答美国报纸编辑问，来阐明和平法令提出的根据，即从资本主义与共产主义两种制度有共存的可能出发的。这样就具体地和全面地说明了苏联所一贯坚持的和平外交政策。在课堂上讨论各种战争的性质问题及苏联粉碎外国武装干涉与国内反革命势力而获得胜利的原因时，就让同学们以朝鲜战争为例，从敌我两方面来分析战争的性质。这样既可引导同学们从现实斗争中更好地理解这一问题，同时也加强了他们对抗美援朝必胜的信心。
    要做到理论与实际联系，必须首先研究和了解实际问题，而时事学习就是了解现实斗争和学习党的方针政策的最重要的方法之一。
    学员们每天最少读一小时到两小时人民日报，并在教学小组长的领导下，进行集体的时事学习。每月有两个学员轮流在小组里做系统的专题时事报告，大家根据报告内容展开讨论。这学期他们已经报告和讨论了关于国际形势，反对细菌战，朝鲜和平谈判，高等教师思想改造，斯大林答美国报纸编辑问和国际经济会议等六个专门问题。
    这种以集体学习辅助个人学习的方式，有如下几方面的优点：
    一、可以补救个人读报的不足，使大家对问题了解的更深刻更全面。如最近讨论了国际经济会议问题，不仅使每个人明确地认识了召开这个会议的条件以及这个会议的成就和意义，而且体会到它对保卫世界和平的伟大意义。
    二、专题报告和讨论，改善了每个人的读报方法，使同志们不再孤零零地看新闻，而是注意研究各个重大问题的“来龙去脉”了。
    三、做报告的同志，都初步地学会了分析时事问题和组织材料的方法，打开了进行专题研究的门径。如曾紫霞同志做关于高等教师思想改造的报告，在分析和批判资产阶级的所谓“超政治”“超阶级”的错误观点时，就进一步地理解了尤金博士所讲的自然科学与上层建筑的关系。
