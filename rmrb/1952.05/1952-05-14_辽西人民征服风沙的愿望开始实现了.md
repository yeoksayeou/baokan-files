The Long-Held Wish

Liaoxi Province is located in the western part of the Northeast Administrative Region, bordering the Inner Mongolian desert area to the north. Although most of it is plains, the land is not fertile, especially in the border counties, which are often plagued by wind and sand. Every spring, seasonal winds sweep across the continent from the southwest, with yellow dust obscuring the sky and shifting sand moving eastward, swallowing large areas of farmland, causing barren sandy areas to expand year by year. For example, the northern half of Zhangwu County has almost completely turned into sand dunes. Da Yijianfang Village in the Tenth District has been forced to move twice in the past twenty years due to shifting sand. During the crop-growing season, the climate is particularly dry, often causing severe droughts. Last year, the average spring rainfall in the province was less than nine centimeters, and more than one million hectares of land could not be sown on time. The upper reaches of the Liao River, Raoyang River, Yangximu River, and other rivers lack trees, and sand is washed into the rivers by rainwater, causing the riverbeds to continuously silt up. During the season of continuous伏雨rains, floods often occur. Last August, a mountain torrent broke out in the upper reaches of the Liao River, causing a severe flood that submerged most areas of eight counties, including Tieling, Kaiyuan, and Xinmin. Thus, the three natural disasters of wind, sand, drought, and flood have become the fatal threat to the people of Western Liaoning. Due to the reduction of arable land and the impoverishment of the soil, the harvest of crops has been affected, and the people have long lived in poverty.

The severity of natural disasters in Western Liaoning is inseparable from the criminal acts of the reactionary rulers of past dynasties. Eighty or ninety years ago, the border counties were covered with forests. At that time, the climate was harmonious, the rainfall was abundant, and the harvest of crops was also very abundant. The Manchu government and feudal warlords destroyed these trees. Later, Japanese imperialism carried out predatory logging. The Kuomintang reactionary rulers, in order to fight the civil war and build fortifications, swept away all the remaining trees. As a result, this area became a bare, bald mountain, and there was nothing to stop the movement of shifting sand, and natural disasters became more and more serious.

Transforming nature, conquering wind and sand, eliminating floods, and seizing farmland from nature are the long-held wishes of the people of Western Liaoning. In the era of reactionary rule, this wish had no possibility of being realized; in the era of the people's democratic dictatorship, the people's wish began to be realized.

A Great Initiative

In 1950, the Northeast People's Government decided to build farmland shelterbelts in the western part of Northeast China. This is a great initiative to transform nature on a large scale.

Liaoxi Province is the key province for building shelterbelts. Zhangwu, Shuangliao, Kangping, Xinmin, Changbei, Changtu, Lishu, Faku, Heishan, Fuxin and other ten counties plan to afforest 117,212 hectares (this is the statistics for seven counties, missing afforestation figures for Faku, Heishan, and Fuxin; the same applies to the statistics below), mainly by building forest belts, preparing to build twenty-eight east-west main belts (one every ten kilometers); six north-south main belts (one every twenty kilometers); one hundred and twelve east-west secondary belts (one every two kilometers); twenty-one north-south secondary belts (one every four kilometers). The forest belt area will occupy a total of 25,937 hectares. Secondly, in the middle of the forest belts, it is planned to build 49,275 hectares of windbreak forest nets, with each mesh being 12.5 hectares in size. To deal with mobile sand dunes, the method of "surrounding layer by layer and destroying one by one" will be adopted, with 18,700 hectares of sand-fixation forests being built. On the banks of the Liao River, Liu River, and Raoyang River, 4,300 hectares of embankment and bank protection forests will be built. In the upper reaches of the Yangximu River in Zhangwu, the upper reaches of the Lijiia River in Kangping, and the source of the Erlongshan Reservoir in Lishu, 19,000 hectares of water conservation forests will be built. In addition, in Suizhong, Jinxi, Xingcheng, Jin County, Panshan and other five counties and Shanhaiguan City, it is planned to build an 800-li-long coastal defense forest along the coast of the Bohai Sea, which will be combined with the farmland shelterbelts. The entire afforestation plan is scheduled to be completed in 1957.

After the completion of this huge shelterbelt, not only can it change the face of the natural environment in Western Liaoning Province and fundamentally overcome disasters such as wind, sand, drought, and floods, but it can also expand arable land by 230,000 hectares and make the existing arable land soil fertile, which can increase yields by an average of 20% to 30%. If you add the timber revenue, it is estimated that after ten years, it can increase grain production by at least 600,000 tons per year. Other benefits, such as regulating climate and rainfall, and improving people's living conditions and health conditions, are countless.

The possibility of building shelterbelts fully demonstrates the superiority of the new democratic social system and marks the further development of our country's economic construction. This great initiative has won the warm support and cheers of the people of Western Liaoning.

The First Year

1952 is the first year that the shelterbelt will be built ahead of schedule.

In this year, the entire Liaoxi Province plans to afforest 11,800 hectares. 48% of the total will be completed in the spring, and the rest is scheduled to be completed in the rainy season and autumn. In order to complete this huge task, the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government invested a large amount of manpower and material resources and made many preparations.

As early as last autumn and winter, the Provincial People's Government sent people to measure the afforestation sites, made thorough and practical plans, and held mass forestry technical training. In mid-March this year, it also convened an enlarged meeting of forestry responsible cadres from various counties to discuss afforestation and forest protection, focusing on improving the survival rate of afforestation, and made in-depth arrangements and mobilizations. In late March, it organized more than 1,000 technical cadres from the province, counties, and districts to go to the countryside, to the areas where shelterbelts were being built, to cooperate in mobilizing the masses and providing technical guidance and inspection. Counties building shelterbelts have also convened afforestation conferences and technical lectures to further mobilize and inspect afforestation preparations. Seventy-eight nurseries across the province have produced more than 200 million seedlings to supply the needs of afforestation areas.

In order to unify the leadership of the shelterbelt construction business, Liaoxi Province has established a desert afforestation bureau in Zhangwu, a key afforestation county, with an affiliated afforestation experiment station, and also established 50 technical guidance stations on the afforestation site to conduct afforestation business guidance at any time. Among the technical cadres participating in the guidance, a system of liaison contracts and segmented and partitioned responsibility was implemented. From seedling supply to on-site planting, each process and each link was the responsibility of a dedicated person, ensuring that technical guidance kept up with the actual actions of the masses, achieving a survival rate of 85% or more.

In the afforestation areas, the cooperative afforestation system has been vigorously promoted, mobilizing the masses participating in the construction to form various forms of afforestation and forest protection teams in a voluntary combination, and signing large and small cooperative afforestation contracts with the state. The contract stipulates that the state will supply seedlings and seeds, and the masses will provide labor to engage in construction and protection work in the designated areas. In the future, when the trees grow up, the income will be divided according to the ratio of 20% public and 80% private. Part of the cultivated land occupied by the shelterbelts will be compensated with public land, or the masses will be mobilized to adjust it themselves, or the land will be used as a cooperative afforestation share. Most counties also combined policy education with socialist prospect education and publicity on the significance of building shelterbelts. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation has been unprecedentedly high. Many farmers regard building shelterbelts as one of the patriotic actions, and the cooperative mutual aid organizations participating in the agricultural patriotic bumper harvest competition movement also regard afforestation and tree planting as one of the specific contents of the challenge competition. This large-scale construction action began in full swing.

The Upsurge of Spring Shelterbelt Construction

During the Qingming season, Western Liaoning was full of early spring atmosphere. In the areas where shelterbelts are being built, people from thousands of villages have been nervously acting and moving to the forefront of conquering nature. On April 6, the masses in Wangjia Village, Fourth District, Zhangwu, began the construction of shelterbelts on the six-li-long sandy ridge north of the village. As if holding a great happy event, the whole village mobilized more than 400 people. Song Zhanwen, the 75-year-old father of Song Huanqing, the leader of the afforestation team, also participated in pulling ropes and supporting seedlings. The Ma Shuge afforestation team used carts to haul water from the river bend two li away. Many afforestation teams carried water themselves. The whole village planted 14.5 hectares of seedlings, and each seedling was watered with two or three bowls of water. They wanted to ensure that "one tree planted, one tree lives." Everyone said, "Don't think it's difficult to get water. We must pour more water. Planting trees is for more grain. This is not a waste of work."

The masses in Gaoligou Village, Eighth District, Faku, launched a tree planting competition between villages, groups, and households before the Qingming Festival. 212 households and 407 people participated in the afforestation. Braving the violent wind and sand, they competed to work in the afforestation zone, proposing the slogan of "see who plants well and digs quickly." Many young men rushed to carry water to water the seedlings, and Wang Suyan, the director of the village women's affairs, led the women to support and plant the seedlings. After the concerted efforts of the whole village, they planted 30 hectares of forest belts in two days, not only completing the construction plan one day ahead of schedule, but also exceeding the area by five hectares. Afterwards, the whole village held a general meeting to elect eight tree planting models.

After half a month of intensive efforts, the counties in Liaoxi Province participating in the construction of forest belts have built 5,664 hectares of shelterbelts by around April 20, exceeding the spring construction plan by 392 hectares, creating a good start for the future construction of shelterbelts.

After the completion of the spring construction task, strengthening cultivation and protection has become an important task. All afforestation and forest protection teams have taken on this new task with great concern.

    辽西人民征服风沙的愿望开始实现了
    萧白门
    多年的愿望
    辽西省位从东北行政区的西部，北接内蒙沙漠地带，虽然大部分是平原，但土地并不肥沃，特别是边境上的几个县，经常遭受风沙侵害。每当春天，季节风自西南横扫大陆，黄尘蔽天，流沙东进，吞没了大片的耕地，使得不毛的沙荒逐年扩大。例如，彰武县北半部几乎已完全变成沙丘；第十区大一间房村，二十年来竟被流沙赶得搬了两次家。在庄稼生长的季节，气候格外干燥，往往造成严重的旱灾。去年全省春季降雨量平均还不足九公分，有一百多万垧地未能按时播种。辽河、绕阳河、养息牧等河流的上游，缺乏树木，沙土被雨水冲入河内，河床不断淤高。每到伏雨连绵的季节，经常泛滥成灾。去年八月间辽河上游山洪暴发，造成严重的水灾，淹没铁岭、开原、新民等八个县的大部地区。这样，风沙、干旱、洪水三种自然灾害，便成了辽西人民的致命威胁。由于耕地缩减、土质变瘠，影响了农作物的收成，人民长期过着贫困的生活。
    辽西自然灾害所以这样严重，是和历代反动统治者的罪恶行为分不开的。在八、九十年以前，边境上几个县，遍地都是森林。那时，气候调和，雨量充沛，农作物的收成也很丰盈。满清政府和封建军阀破坏了这些树木。以后日本帝国主义又进行掠夺性的采伐。国民党反动统治者为了打内战，修工事，使所有残存树木一扫而光。结果，这一带变成赤裸裸的童山秃岭，再也没有东西阻止流沙的移动，自然灾害就越来越严重了。
    改造自然、征服风沙、消灭水灾、向自然夺取耕地，这是辽西人民多年的愿望。在反动统治时代，这种愿望根本没有实现的可能；在人民民主专政的时代，人民这种愿望开始实现了。
    伟大的创举
    一九五○年，东北人民政府决定在东北西部营造农田防护林带。这是大规模改造自然的创举。
    辽西省是营造防护林带的重点省。彰武、双辽、康平、新民、昌北、昌图、梨树、法库、黑山、阜新等十个县，计划造林十一万七千二百十二垧（这是七个县的统计，里面缺法库、黑山、阜新等三县造林数字，以下统计同），以营造林带为主，准备造东西主带二十八条（每隔十公里一条）；南北主带六条（每隔二十公里一条）；东西副带一百一十二条（每隔二公里一条）；南北副带二十一条（每隔四公里一条），林带面积共占地二万五千九百三十七垧。其次，在林带中间，计划造防风林网四万九千二百七十五垧，每块网眼有十二垧半大。对移动沙丘采取“层层包围、各个击破”的办法，造固沙林一万八千七百垧。在辽河、柳河、绕阳河两岸，造护堤护岸林四千三百垧。在彰武养息牧河上游、康平李家河上游、梨树二龙山贮水库发源地，造水源涵养林一万九千垧。另外，在绥中、锦西、兴城、锦县、盘山等五县和山海关市，计划沿渤海海岸线造一道八百里长的海防林，与农田防护林带合拢。全部造林计划预定在一九五七年完成。
    这个庞大的防护林带营造成功后，不仅可以改变辽西省自然环境的面貌，从根本上战胜风沙、水旱等灾害，而且可以扩大耕地二十三万垧，并使现有耕地土质变肥，平均能提高产量百分之二十到三十；如果再加上木材收益，估计十年以后，每年最少可以增产六十万吨粮食。其他如调节气候雨量，改善人民的居住条件和健康条件，好处是不可以数计的。
    营造防护林带所以成为可能，充分显示出新民主主义社会政治制度的优越性，标志着我们祖国经济建设事业进一步的发展。这件伟大的创举，赢得了辽西人民的热烈拥护和欢呼。
    第一年
    一九五二年，是防护林带提前开始营造的第一年。
    在这一年里，全辽西省计划造林一万一千八百垧。春季要完成总数的百分之四十八，其余预定在雨季和秋季完成。为了完成这个巨大的任务，辽西省人民政府投入了大批人力物力，做了许多准备工作。
    早在去年秋、冬两季，省人民政府就派人测量了造林地点，做出周密、实际的计划，并举办了群众性的林业技术普及训练。今年三月中旬，又召开了各县林业负责干部参加的造林护林扩大会议，以提高造林成活率为中心，做了深入的布置、动员。三月下旬，又组织省、县、区一千多名技术干部下乡，到营造防护林带的地区，配合发动群众，进行技术指导和检查。各营造防护林带的县份也都先后召开了造林大会和技术讲习会，进一步发动、检查造林准备工作。全省七十八处苗圃，起出了两亿多棵树苗，供应了造林地区的需要。
    为了统一领导营造防护林带的业务，辽西省在造林重点县彰武设立了一处沙荒造林局，附营一所造林试验站，又在造林现地设立了五十个技术指导站，随时进行造林业务的指导。参加指导的技术干部中间，推行了连系合同和分段分片负责制，从种苗供应到实地种植，每个过程，每个环节，都有专人负责，保证技术指导跟上群众的实际行动，达到成活率在百分之八十五以上的要求。
    在造林地区，大力推广了合作造林制，动员参加营造的群众，按自愿结合的方式，组成各种形式的造林、护林小组，和国家签订大大小小的合作造林合同。合同上规定：由国家供应树苗种籽，群众出劳动力，在计划指定的地段上，从事营造和保护工作，将来树木成长起来，收益按公二私八分红。对防护林带所占用的一部分耕地，或用公地补偿，或发动群众自行调剂，或将土地做为合作造林的股份。大部县份并结合政策教育，进行了社会主义的前途教育和营造防护林带的意义的宣传。这样，群众造林积极性空前高涨，很多农民把营造防护林带列为爱国行动之一，参加农业爱国丰产竞赛运动的合作互助组织，也把造林植树当做挑战竞赛的具体内容之一。这样热火朝天的大规模营造行动就开始了。
    春季营造林带的热潮
    清明时节，辽西充满了早春的气息。在营造防护林带地区，千百个村落的人们已紧张地行动起来，走上征服自然的最前线。四月六日，彰武四区王家村群众，在村北六里多长的沙岗上，开始了防护林带的营造工作。好像举办一件大喜事一样，全村出动了四百来人。造林组长宋焕青的七十五岁的老父亲宋占文，也参加了拉绳、扶苗工作。马书阁造林小组用大车到二里外的河套去拉水，很多造林小组自己挑水，全村共栽了十四垧半地的树苗，每棵树苗都灌了两三碗水，他们要保证“栽一棵活一棵”。大家说：“别看弄水困难，说什么也要多灌点，栽树是为了多打粮，这不算白搭工。”
    法库八区高力沟村群众，在清明节前展开了屯与屯、组与组、户与户的造林竞赛，二百一十二户、四百零七人参加造林。他们冒着狂暴的风沙，在造林地带比赛着干活，提出“看谁栽的好、刨的快”的口号。很多年青小伙子抢着挑水浇苗，村妇女主任汪素颜领导妇女扶苗栽苗。经过全村人齐心努力，两天就栽了三十垧地的林带，不但提前一天完成了营造计划，还超过五垧面积。过后，全村开大会评选出八名植树模范。
    辽西省参加营造林带的县，经过半个月紧张突击，到四月二十日前后已营造防护林带五千六百六十四垧，超过今春营造计划三百九十二垧，给今后营造防护林带的工作，创造了一个良好的开端。
    在春季营造任务完成后，加意培育保护就成为重要任务。全体造林、护林小组，都以莫大的关切心情担负起了这个新的工作。
