Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 27th: According to news from West German "Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur," the so-called "General Treaty" between West Germany's "Federal Republic" and the United States, Britain, and France was signed in Bonn on May 26th.

As everyone knows, this separate "treaty" between the Western countries and the Bonn government aims to get West Germany to participate in the military bloc of Western European countries—the "European Defence Community," which is part of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc.

The "General Treaty" grants the Western countries unlimited rights to station troops in West Germany. They have the right to declare a state of emergency in West Germany at any time and take all power into their own hands. According to this "treaty," all expenses of the Western countries' occupation forces, as well as the expenses of West Germany establishing and maintaining an army under the infamous "European Army" system, must be borne by the Bonn government.

These enslaving obligations that the Bonn government must bear are detailed in the "subsidiary agreements" of the "General Treaty"—namely, the agreement on the stationing of Western countries' troops in West Germany, and the agreement on West Germany's financial expenditure for participating in the "European Army." In addition, these enslaving obligations are also detailed in the so-called "Agreement on the Transition Period."

The "General Treaty" does not guarantee West Germany's independence and sovereignty in any way. Formally, this treaty will replace the Western countries' occupation regulations. However, in reality, this treaty still maintains the military occupation regime in West Germany, keeping West Germany in a dependent and subordinate position to the Western countries. The "General Treaty" will take effect after being ratified by the parliaments of the three Western countries and the Bonn parliament.

The "General Treaty" is a military agreement between the US and British warmongers and the West German militarists and revanchists. The military "General Treaty" will deepen the division of Germany, hinder Germany's early reunification and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, while legitimizing the establishment of an aggressive army in West Germany, increasing the danger of a new war.

It is worth pointing out that Bonn Chancellor Adenauer signed this "General Treaty" against the clearly expressed will of the entire German people.

German democratic public opinion believes that Adenauer's signing of the "General Treaty" is not only an act of national betrayal but also a political conspiracy aimed at establishing a military dictatorship in West Germany. This view is very correct.

The atmosphere in which this separate "General Treaty" was signed in Bonn best illustrates the German people's attitude towards it. According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur reporter in Bonn, on the day of the signing, 25,500 armed police officers were deployed in Bonn and the surrounding area, transferred from all over the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The entire city seemed to have become a military fortress. The police were ordered to use any means necessary to severely suppress the people if they demonstrated against Adenauer's traitorous actions. Motor police units equipped with machine guns were in combat-ready condition. Police constantly patrolled the streets, dispersing all crowds. The parliament building, where the treaty signing "ceremony" was held, was surrounded by a dense circle of police.

The mood of the West German people can also be seen in another fact: The Bonn government had ordered all state organs to fly flags on this day to celebrate, but of all nine states in West Germany, only two complied with this order. The administrative authorities of the other seven states refused to fly flags, considering the unrest among the people, which was tantamount to protesting against the signing of the "General Treaty."

This extraordinary tension could even be felt among the representatives of the Western countries. According to reporters, the representative of the French government had requested at the last moment to "guarantee" explicitly that the revanchist army established by Germany under the "European Army" system would not be used against France. According to news from Paris, the reason why the French delegation made such a reservation was because the French ruling group, in view of the French people's mass protests against the militarization and war policy embodied in the "General Treaty," feared that the signing of the "General Treaty" would trigger a government crisis in France.

Now, people all over Germany are holding mass rallies and demonstrations to protest against the Bonn Treaty between the US-British imperialists and the West German revanchists.

### 美英法三国与阿登纳签订“一般性条约”  企图使西德参加侵略集团加深德国分裂

    美英法三国与阿登纳签订“一般性条约”
    企图使西德参加侵略集团加深德国分裂
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社柏林二十七日讯：据西德“德意志新闻社”消息，西德“联邦共和国”和美、英、法三国之间的所谓“一般性条约”已于五月二十六日在波恩签字。
    大家都知道，西方国家和波恩政府之间这个单独
    “条约”，目的是要使西德参加西欧国家的军事集团——作为北大西洋侵略集团一个组成部分的“欧洲防御集团”。
    “一般性条约”给予西方国家在西德驻扎军队的无限制的权利。它们有权在任何时候在西德宣布紧急状态，把全部权力都掌握到它们自己的手里。根据这个“条约”，西方各国占领军的全部费用，以及西德在声名狼藉的“欧洲军”体系之下建立军队及维持军队的费用，全都须由波恩政府负担。
    波恩政府必须承担的这些奴役性的义务，都详细地写在“一般性条约”的“附属协定”中——这便是关于西方国家在西德驻扎军队的协定、关于西德参加“欧洲军”的财政开支的协定。此外这些奴役性的义务还详细地写在所谓“关于过渡时期的协定”里面。
    “一般性条约”根本谈不上什么保障西德的独立和主权。在形式上说，这个条约将代替西方国家的占领法规。但是，实际上这条约仍然把西德的军事占领政权保持了下来，使西德仍然处于依附和从属于西方国家的地位。“一般性条约”将在西方三国议会和波恩议会批准之后生效。
    “一般性条约”是美英战争贩子和西德军国主义者及复仇主义者之间的军事协定。军事性的“一般性条约”将加深德国的分裂，将妨碍德国的早日统一以及缔结对德和约，而使西德建立侵略军队合法化，增加新战争的危险。
    值得指出的是，波恩总理阿登纳违背德国全体人民明白表示的意志，而签订了这个“一般性条约”。
    德国民主舆论认为，阿登纳签订“一般性条约”，不仅是背叛民族的行为，而更是一个政治阴谋，目的是要在西德建立军事独裁。这种看法是非常正确的。
    这个单独的“一般性条约”在波恩签订时的气氛，最足以说明德国人民对它的态度。据德意志通讯社驻波恩记者报道，在签字的那天，波恩市和市区有从北来因—威斯特伐利亚全州各地调来的二万五千五百名武装警察警戒。全城仿佛成了一个军事要塞。警察奉命，如果人民示威反抗阿登纳的卖国行动，就将不择手段严加镇压。装备有机关枪的摩托警察队处于战斗准备状态。警察来回不断地在街上巡逻，驱散一切人群。在举行条约签字“仪式”的议会大厦周围，密层层地布置着一圈警察。
    在另一个事实上也可以看出西德人民的情绪：波恩政府曾经下令一切国家机关在这一天都要悬旗志庆，可是在西德全部九个州当中，只有两个州遵守了这个命令。其他七个州的行政当局因为考虑到人民群众当中的不安，因而拒绝悬旗，这无异即是对
    “一般性条约”签字的抗议。
    这种异常的紧张情绪甚至在西方国家代表之间也可以感觉得到。据记者说，法国政府的代表在最后一刻曾经要求，明确“保证”德国在“欧洲军”体系之下建立的复仇主义军队不用来对付法国。据巴黎消息，法国代表团之所以提出这样的保留，是因为法国统治集团鉴于法国人民大众对这个“一般性条约”所体现的军国主义化和战争政策的抗议，害怕一旦“一般性条约”签订之后会促成法国的政府危机。
    现在，全德国各地的人民都纷纷举行群众大会和示威，抗议美英帝国主义者和西德复仇主义者之间的波恩条约。
