    Teachers Who Use Brutal Methods to Treat Children Should Be Punished
    Editor: Ouyang Xian, a teacher at the Second School of Hengjiang Township, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, has consistently used brutal methods to treat students. On April 25th, Long Yingwei, a student at the school, forgot to bring back his hoe after using his spare time to dig up turf as fertilizer for the family of a serviceman lacking labor. Ouyang Xian, taking advantage of a grudge against Long Yingwei's family, falsely accused him of intentionally stealing the hoe and organized the students to hold a mass meeting to "struggle" against him. Ouyang Xian even led the students in shouting slogans such as "Down with Long Yingwei." Such a young and weak child, of course, could not withstand such a cruel "struggle," and he fell ill upon returning home.
    Afterwards, Ouyang Xian said triumphantly, "This 'struggle' was really ruthless." When the masses offered criticism, he retorted, "I am a people's teacher, and the rice bowl of a people's teacher is ironclad and cannot be broken. Anyone who dares to attack me should be severely punished." That is how he intimidated the masses.
    Ouyang Xian has already been transferred to the District People's Government for reflection. We believe that Ouyang Xian's vile style is intolerable. He should be given appropriate punishment.　Li Changye

    用野蛮办法对待儿童的教师应该受到惩处
    编辑同志：湖南省衡阳县横江乡第二校教员欧阳咸，一贯地用野蛮的手段对待学生。四月二十五日，该校学生龙英伟在课余之际，给缺乏劳动力的军人家属刨草皮作肥料，忘记了带回锄头。欧阳咸因对龙英伟的家庭有意见，就乘机诬陷他有意偷窃锄头，组织学生开大会“斗争”他，欧阳咸还领导学生高呼“打倒龙英伟”等口号。这样一个幼弱的儿童当然经不起这样一场残酷的“斗争”，他回家就病倒了。
    事后欧阳咸还得意洋洋地说：“这场‘斗争’实在斗得狠。”群众向他提意见，他反说：“我是人民教师，人民教师的饭碗是铁打的，是打不烂的，如有那个敢打击我，那是应受严办的。”他就是这样吓唬群众。
    欧阳咸已经被调到区人民政府反省。我们认为，欧阳咸这样恶劣的作风，是令人不能容忍的。应该给他适当的惩处。　李常晔
