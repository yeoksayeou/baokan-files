Striving for the Mass Character and Militancy of Military Art and Literature
--Basic Summary and Self-Criticism of "Liberation Army Literature"
"Liberation Army Literature" Editorial Department

"Liberation Army Literature" is an art and literature publication serving the soldiers and publicizing the People's Army. Its mission is to promote the revolutionary heroism of the People's Liberation Army, with a view to inspiring fighting will in the People's Army and among the people of the whole country, and to conduct education in the working class's patriotism and internationalism. In order to achieve this goal, "Liberation Army Literature" must be combined with the political tasks of the People's Liberation Army in each period, with the actual struggles of the People's Liberation Army in each period, and must truthfully reflect the glorious combat traditions and real struggle life of the People's Army. Only in this way can "Liberation Army Literature" specifically implement Chairman Mao's orientation that art and literature are for the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Since its inception, "Liberation Army Literature" has been working under the guidance of this policy. Although there have been some achievements, a strict examination in the spirit of the "Three-Anti" Movement and the rectification of art and literature reveals many shortcomings. Below we examine the work of our editorial department from three aspects, and at the same time, improve the work of our editorial department from three aspects.

First, it is a matter of more resolutely taking a firm working-class stand. With the support of the entire army, "Liberation Army Literature" has, to a certain extent, combined with and reflected the reality of the current struggle. In 1951, the main tasks of the Chinese People's Army were: participating in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, liberating Tibet, thoroughly eliminating the remaining bandits on the mainland, consolidating national defense, and engaging in production and construction. The soldiers and cadres of our People's Army demonstrated extraordinary revolutionary heroism and great patriotism and internationalism in these several major areas. Our editorial work also concentrated its main strength on organizing manuscripts in these areas. We have repeatedly organized writers and editorial staff to go deep into the Korean battlefield to interview heroic figures and experience combat life. We reflected the heroic battles on the Korean battlefield with considerable space. We have also successively reported on advancing into Tibet, eliminating the remaining bandits on the mainland, consolidating national defense, defending and building the motherland's frontier, and the national people's movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in a relatively substantial way. In particular, we organized several special issues, such as the "March into Tibet" special issue, the "People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang" special issue, "Heroic Close-ups," and "Great Motherland, Heroic People" special issues. In the above works reflecting the reality of the struggle, we showed that our outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, for the sake of the motherland, for the ideals and cause of the working class, waged a victorious revolutionary struggle against imperialism, the remaining bandits, and the harsh natural environment with a lofty spirit of self-sacrifice and fearlessness. We praised the heroic struggle of the People's Army, and we reflected the heroic models that emerged in the struggle from various aspects.

But this does not mean that there are no shortcomings or errors in our editorial thinking and editorial work. In fact, we have made serious mistakes in handling certain specific works. The nature of the errors is mainly that the working-class stand is not clear enough, and thus the simple technical viewpoint of the petty bourgeoisie that remains in the ideology is exposed. We once published a work with major political errors, "No Tail," which was temporarily withdrawn after being discovered by the leadership, but we cannot shirk serious political responsibility because of this. This shows that our political principles are not strong, our political sense of responsibility is not strong, and our class stand is not stable. We have also published several other works with major shortcomings: such as "Little Devil and Regiment Commander," which replaced the solemn fighting thoughts and feelings of the working class with the petty bourgeoisie's standpoint, thoughts, and feelings, writing the Little Devil as a near deity, and the Regiment Commander as a mediocre and incompetent figure, seriously distorting the combat organization and discipline of the People's Army. Such as "He Shouldn't Have Died" and "Breakthrough at the Imjin River," although the author's subjective intention was good, attempting to portray the reality of the People's Army, and there were some commendable descriptions and moving scenes, because the author lacked a deep understanding of the reality of the People's Army, and the author's petty-bourgeois views and feelings were not completely overcome, the work itself seriously revealed the unhealthy ideological emotions of the petty bourgeoisie. "He Shouldn't Have Died" was originally intended to conduct education on the combination of courage and wisdom for the troops, but as a result, it distorted the organization and discipline of the troops. "Breakthrough at the Imjin River" was originally intended to show the great patriotism and internationalism of the People's Army, but because the author was not familiar with the People's Army, and lacked a deep understanding and experience of the excellent essence of the People's Army, what was expressed in the work was still mixed with the ideological feelings of the petty bourgeoisie, and replaced some aspects of the reality of the struggle and the appearance of heroic figures with his own unrealistic imagination, especially the weakness in the performance of combat and problem-solving after the Imjin River breakthrough. The publication of these works shows that our editorial thinking and the unhealthy ideological feelings of these petty-bourgeois authors are interconnected in some deep recesses of the soul. Therefore, we failed to firmly stand on the position of the working class and draw a clear line with petty-bourgeois ideology. In handling these manuscripts, we blurred our serious political standards.

Secondly, in our editorial thinking, closely combining with the political tasks and actual struggles of the entire army is clear, and has generally been achieved. However, if we measure it against the rapid development of the actual struggle and the requirements of the struggle tasks, it is not commensurate. The editorial department's investigation, research, analysis, and grasp of the actual ideological situation and development of the troops are very insufficient and not specific. The editorial department is also relatively poor in its understanding of the rich struggle knowledge of our army, lacks research on the new creations and developments in tactics of our army in recent years, and lacks learning in the knowledge of modern warfare. In 1951, the People's Army made a leap in development in ideological construction, military construction, war art, and the promotion of revolutionary heroism. This leap in development is in line with the sacred historical tasks shouldered by the People's Army today. Therefore, how to fully grasp the major ideological issues, modernization construction issues, and war art issues in the development process of the People's Army, and through the advanced heroic figures with a noble Bolshevik spirit emerging in the People's Army, to conduct systematic, vivid, and specific education for the People's Army, thereby raising the ideological understanding of the People's Army, is something we have not done enough. We have published some works that are not only ideologically weak and tactically unsound, but also have errors in military actions. This shows how important it is for our editorial department and the literary and art workers of our entire army to study military affairs.

Before the establishment of "Liberation Army Literature," when considering the target readers, we stipulated that the target of the publication was cadres above the battalion level and literary and art workers. Although serving cadres and serving the masses are not opposed to each other, in the depths of our minds, there is a confused concept of lacking a correct understanding of popularization and improvement. Although this provision has been corrected since we started editorial work, and has been further educated by the masses in the subsequent practice process and has been changed, this confused concept still has an impact on our editorial work and creates a basis for certain technical viewpoints. This petty-bourgeois erroneous idea of detaching from reality and detaching from the masses often appears like a possessed ghost, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing, and has not been eradicated. This stubborn ghost has affected our correct treatment of the relationship between popularization and improvement. It seems that a good literary work can only be appreciated by certain cadres, and the vast number of soldiers cannot understand it. This is obviously a non-working-class erroneous viewpoint, which is used by the petty bourgeoisie to cover up their preferences and unhealthy ideological feelings. The fact is not like this, the fact is that as long as the literary works that soldiers can read, listen to, accept, understand, and be educated by, and can enthusiastically like, cadres will also enthusiastically like. The working class is a whole, and the members of the working class, regardless of their degree of understanding, have the same class feelings. If literary works cannot be accepted by the feelings of the working class and the vast number of soldiers and cadres, then who will accept its profound "skills"? The result will inevitably be detached from the masses.

From the above aspects of examination, it can be concluded that only by more resolutely and clearly standing firm on the working-class position, eliminating the non-working-class, especially the remaining consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie in the editorial ideology, can we resolutely implement Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction, strengthen the ideological and artistic nature of our publication, give full play to the militancy and mass character of our publication, and make our publication more educational.

Second, we must more clearly strengthen the mass viewpoint. According to the glorious tradition of our army's literary and art work, the policy of "facing the company" and "serving the soldiers," we have published a large number of mass literary and art creations from soldiers in prominent positions and with a large amount of space, such as soldier fast board poems, drum lyrics, collective creations of companies, etc. Because these soldier works are extracted from the rich struggle life, their position is clear and firm; their feelings are healthy and full; their language is vivid and concise, and the practical educational significance is very strong. The best example is the autobiographical novel "Gao Yu Bao" by Comrade Gao Yu Bao, a soldier. In addition, we have also published criticisms and suggestions from the masses, which shows that we pay serious attention to the mass creations and criticisms in the editorial work, and vigorously promote and cultivate them and call on professional writers to learn from them.

However, from the perspective of promoting the excellent tradition of our army's literary and artistic work of "facing the company," it can be found that we have not done enough. For example, the fact that some of the long masterpieces in our publication are not practical, and there is a lack of materials suitable for company singing, which is geared towards the needs of the company, comes down to the result of a lack of a strong mass viewpoint. The unclear mass viewpoint is also manifested in the fact that we have not organized the reading work of the company well for a long time. The publications are published one after another, what is the degree of acceptance of soldiers and junior-level cadres? What educational role did they play for them? We are not very clear. We are satisfied with the achievements in the editorial office, and have not actively organized the company to read. From the ideological point of view, although we organized and published the creations of the masses of soldiers in prominent positions, we always felt that the creations of the masses were natural forms and were rough. We did not look at this issue from the perspective of the profound class essence, but somewhat looked at this issue from the form. Therefore, we often underestimate the educational role played by the creations of the masses among the masses.

Our lack of mass viewpoint is also manifested in our organization of basic-level correspondents. We are accustomed to solving problems through the leadership of the General Political Department of the Military Commission by using administrative orders, but we are not accustomed to solving problems in the middle of our editorial work by using mass, universal, and strong communication organizations. Facts have proved that if the mass communication organization is not established and there is no foundation, simple administrative orders often cannot solve our editorial work problems well or completely. In particular, understanding the actual situation below cannot be done solely by relying on administrative orders. This is a question of taking the mass line.

Only by resolutely strengthening the mass viewpoint and taking the mass line in the editorial work can we better serve the soldiers and effectively solve the problem of popularization and improvement.

Third, the issue of mastering literary and art criticism. We have not fully used the weapons of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism to guide the creative thinking of the entire army and improve the literary and art work of the entire army.

In terms of literary and art ideology, we have conducted struggles more resolutely since the founding of the publication. On the one hand, we vigorously advocated writing positive and active revolutionary heroic images, and at the same time, we strictly criticized the formulaism in the creation of the petty bourgeoisie of "backward to transformation." This work has been successful, but it is not enough. We have conducted a serious struggle against the formulaism in the creation of the petty bourgeoisie of "backward to transformation" that has long occupied the troops. This struggle is completely correct. It can be said that the creative formula of the petty bourgeoisie of "backward to transformation" has generally aroused opposition in ideology, and has gradually been overcome in the works. But at the same time, it has produced absoluteness in the views on certain issues, that is, the work of conducting criticism and self-criticism within the People's Army through literary and art works has been relaxed by us. When opposing the creative formula of the petty bourgeoisie of "backward to transformation," even if this is the main trend in our army's current creation, it is obviously incomplete if we do not clearly point out at the same time that criticizing this creative formula of the petty bourgeoisie does not mean giving up the working class's fighting weapon - criticism and self-criticism. The Bolshevik spirit of criticism and self-criticism is a principle that cannot be lowered. Standing firm on the proletarian position, creating advanced heroic images with the proletarian's full enthusiasm and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism is not only allowed, but also should be done. Otherwise, it is easy to have the illusion that to portray advanced figures, they must be written as a simplified, uncomplex growth process, a conceptual character. In fact, the creative method of revolutionary realism tells us that an advanced figure is formed after several twists and turns and difficulties, and only through the continuous struggle between advanced thoughts and things and backward thoughts and things can heroes grow, advance, and lead readers to advance. The development process of things is always the victory of proletarian ideology over the old views in advancing, and the reality development itself is tortuous and complex. Therefore, literary and art works should also grasp the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, rather than not criticize and self-criticize. The question is what position the author stands on to criticize and how to conduct criticism.

In our editorial work, we have also vigorously advocated writing advanced and positive figures, writing revolutionary heroic images; and emphasized that the spiritual state of heroic figures is first of all based on the infinite loyalty and confidence in the Party, the people, the leader, and the proletarian cause, and the revolutionary optimism to overcome all difficulties. This vigorous advocacy is completely correct, and it has also been successful. Our authors have strived to understand and express those advanced things and advanced heroic figures from the class essence in the great real revolutionary struggle life. But at the same time, the petty bourgeoisie's anti-realistic, "boundless happiness," and lack of militancy optimism has not been criticized ideologically and in the works, pointing out the principal differences between them. In this way, it is easy for petty-bourgeois formalism to take the opportunity to rise its head. In fact, there have already been such works in the works written about the People's Army.

"Liberation Army Literature" is a literary and art publication for the troops, and it has the natural responsibility to provide ideological guidance for the literary and art work of the troops. Since entering the city, the literary and art work of the troops has made achievements, especially the literary and art workers fighting on the Korean front, have made greater achievements. However, the erosion of bourgeois ideology, especially the erosion of petty-bourgeois ideology, is not less serious. The result of the "Three-Anti" Movement shows the seriousness of the problem. Some literary and art workers in the troops are quite confused in their thinking, and are getting farther and farther away from the revolutionary struggle tradition of the People's Army, and are getting closer and closer to the corrosive atmosphere of the bourgeoisie's pursuit of form and emphasis on ostentation. Some authors, detached from politics and reality, or fallen to glorifying the petty bourgeoisie in long masterpieces; or absurdly thinking that there is nothing to write about in the troops, seriously detached from politics and the masses, and feeling tired of the great real struggle. Some work units regard the clear policy of "serving the soldiers" as empty words on paper, thinking that "facing the company" is to lower themselves, and they should go to the city to "improve." Our editorial work has underestimated the nature and extent of this bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological erosion in the past, and therefore the battle against this confused thought and the battle against this bourgeois and petty-bourgeois decadent thought are also weak and untimely. Criticism and self-criticism, this fighting weapon, has not been used enough and in a timely manner in our editorial work. Whether it is the guidance of literary and art ideology, the mastery of the literary and art movement, or the analysis and criticism of specific works, we have not done enough. Although we have also conducted several criticisms of petty-bourgeois ideology in our creative thinking, on the whole, the battle against the influence of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie lacks careful planning and deployment. The lack of strong ideological leadership is due to our low level of understanding on the one hand, but more importantly, it is due to our poor working-class political sense of responsibility, and to the fact that some non-working-class confused concepts exist in ourselves.

In the future, our editorial work should be ideologically alert, stand firm on our working-class position in the spirit of the "Three-Anti" Movement, consolidate our concept of serving the soldiers, bravely and boldly criticize our past errors and shortcomings, and fully promote our past advantages and achievements. Rely on the leadership, rely on the masses, rely on our own efforts and learning to correct our errors and shortcomings, so that "Liberation Army Literature" is worthy of its own title, truly loved by the vast number of soldiers and cadres, becomes a publication that educates the People's Army with patriotism and internationalism, becomes a publication that disseminates the revolutionary heroism and advanced ideas of the People's Liberation Army, and becomes a publication that guides the literary and art ideology of the troops. We are willing to work together with our vast number of soldiers, cadres, and people who love the People's Army. We should always remember: only by relying on the help of the broad masses can we do a good job in editorial work. We sincerely hope that readers will always care about our publication, often criticize us, and hope to organize reading so as to examine and test our work among the masses.

    为部队文艺工作的群众性、战斗性而斗争
    ——“解放军文艺”的基本总结和检讨
    “解放军文艺”编辑部
    “解放军文艺”是为兵服务和宣传人民军队的文艺刊物。它的任务是：宣扬人民解放军的革命英雄主义，以期在人民军队中间，在全国人民中间，鼓舞战斗意志，进行工人阶级的爱国主义和国际主义的教育。为了实现这个目的，“解放军文艺”就必须和人民解放军每一时期的政治任务结合，就必须和人民解放军每一时期的现实斗争结合，就必须真实地表现人民军队光荣的战斗传统和现实斗争生活。也只有这样，“解放军文艺”才能具体贯彻毛主席的文艺为工农兵的文艺方向。
    “解放军文艺”自创刊以来，就是在这一方针指导下进行工作的。虽然有过一些成绩，但以“三反”运动和文艺整风的精神严格地检查起来，还存在着不少缺点。下面我们从三方面来检查我们编辑部的工作，也同时从三方面来改进我们编辑部的工作。
    第一、是要更坚决地站稳工人阶级立场的问题。“解放军文艺”在全军支持下，曾在一定程度上结合和反映了当前斗争的现实。一九五一年中国人民军队的主要任务是：参加抗美援朝运动，解放西藏，彻底肃清大陆上的残余匪帮，巩固国防和生产建设。我们人民军队的战士和干部在这几个主要方面，表现了非凡的革命英雄气概、伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神。我们的编辑工作，也就集中了主要的力量，在这几个方面，组织了稿件。我们曾多次组织作家和编辑部工作人员深入朝鲜战场，采访英雄人物，体验战斗生活。我们以相当大的篇幅反映了朝鲜战场上的英雄的战斗。在进军西藏，肃清大陆残匪，巩固国防，保卫和建设祖国边疆及全国人民的抗美援朝运动等方面，我们也陆续地比较有分量地进行了报道。特别是集中地组织了几个特辑，如：“进军西藏”特辑、“在新疆的人民解放军”特辑、“英雄特写”、“伟大的祖国、英雄的人民”等特辑。在以上反映现实斗争的这些作品中，表现了我们中国人民的优秀儿女，为了祖国，为了工人阶级的理想和事业，以崇高的自我牺牲精神，无畏地和帝国主义、残余匪帮、以及艰险的自然环境进行了胜利的革命斗争。我们歌颂了人民军队的这种英雄斗争，我们从各个方面反映了在斗争中涌现出来的英雄榜样。
    但这不能说，我们的编辑思想和编辑工作，就没有缺点、没有错误了。事实上，我们在处理某些具体作品时，还发生过严重的错误。错误的性质主要是工人阶级的立场不够明确，因而在思想上所残存的小资产阶级的单纯技术观点就暴露出来了。我们曾刊载过有重大政治错误的作品“没尾巴”，虽经领导方面发觉，临时抽掉了，但我们却不能因此而推卸严重的政治责任。这说明我们政治原则性是不强的，政治责任心是不强的，阶级立场是不稳的。我们也发表了其他几篇有重大缺点的作品：如“小鬼与团长”，用小资产阶级的立场、思想和感情，代替了工人阶级庄严的战斗思想和感情，把小鬼写得神乎其神，把团长倒反写成了一个庸碌无能的人物，严重歪曲了人民军队的战斗的组织性和纪律性。如“他不该死”和“突破临津江”，虽然作者的主观意图是好的，是企图表现人民军队的现实的，也有一些可取的描写和动人的场面，但是因为作者对人民军队的现实缺乏深刻理解，作者的小资产阶级的观点和感情没有完全克服，所以作品本身就严重地流露了小资产阶级的不健康的思想情绪。“他不该死”本拟对部队进行勇敢和智慧相结合的教育，但结果歪曲了部队的组织性和纪律性。“突破临津江”本拟表现人民军队伟大的爱国主义和国际主义精神，但因作者对人民军队不熟悉，对人民军队的优秀本质缺乏深刻的认识和体会，在作品中表现出来的东西，仍然是夹杂着小资产阶级的思想感情，并以自己的不合实际的想像代替了一些现实斗争和英雄人物的面貌，特别是临津江突破以后表现战斗表现解决问题软弱无力。这些作品的发表，说明了我们的编辑思想，和这些作者小资产阶级的不健康的思想感情，在某些灵魂深处，是一脉相通的。因此就未能坚定地站稳工人阶级的立场，和小资产阶级思想划清界限。在处理这些稿件时，就模糊了我们的严肃的政治标准。
    其次，在我们的编辑思想上，紧密结合全军的政治任务和现实斗争，虽然是明确的，并且也一般的作到了。但是如果拿现实斗争的迅速发展和斗争任务对我们的要求来衡量，却是不相称的。编辑部对部队实际的思想情况、发展情况的调查、研究、分析和掌握得都很不够，很不具体。编辑部对我军丰富的斗争知识也是比较贫乏的，对我军近年来在战术上的新创造和发展更缺乏研究，对近代化作战的知识也缺乏学习。一九五一年，人民军队无论是在思想建设上，在军事建设上，在战争艺术上，在革命英雄主义的发扬上，都有着飞跃的发展，这种飞跃的发展，是符合人民军队在今天所肩负着的神圣的历史任务的。因此，如何充分掌握人民军队在发展过程中的重大思想问题，近代化建设问题，战争艺术问题，通过在人民军队中涌现出来的具有高贵的布尔什维克精神的先进英雄人物，对人民军队进行有系统的生动而具体的教育，从而提高人民军队的思想认识，我们更是做得不够。我们发表过一些作品，这些作品不仅思想性不强，在战术原则上讲不通，即在军事动作上也是有错误的。这说明我们编辑部和我们全军的文艺工作者，学习军事是何等的重要。
    “解放军文艺”创刊以前，在考虑到读者对象的时候，我们曾规定过刊物的对象是营以上的干部和文艺工作者。虽然，为干部和为群众，并不是对立的；但是，在我们思想深处，却存在着对普及和提高缺乏正确理解的糊涂观念。虽然，这一规定在我们开始编辑工作时就已经改正了，并在其后的实践过程中进一步受到了群众的教育，有了改变，但这个糊涂观念仍在我们的编辑工作中发生了影响，为某些技术观点制造了根据。这种小资产阶级脱离实际、脱离群众的错误的提高想法，便常常像附体的幽灵似的，忽隐忽现，未能根绝。这个顽固的幽灵，影响了我们正确地对待普及和提高的关系。仿佛一篇好的文艺作品，只有一定的干部才能欣赏，广大战士是无从理解似的。这显然是一种非工人阶级的错误观点，是小资产阶级用来掩饰自己的喜好和不健康的思想感情的。事实决不是这样，事实是只要战士能读、能听、能接受、能理解、能受到教育，能够热烈喜好的文艺作品，干部也就会热烈喜好。工人阶级是一个整体，工人阶级的成员不问其理解程度如何，都具有同一的阶级感情，如果文艺作品不能为工人阶级和广大士兵及干部的感情所接受，那么，其高深的“技巧”到底让谁来接受呢？其结果就一定会脱离群众。
    从以上几个方面检查，可以论断，只有更坚决、更明确地站稳工人阶级立场，肃清编辑思想上的非工人阶级的特别是小资产阶级的残存意识，才能够坚决贯彻毛泽东的文艺方向，才能够加强我们刊物的思想性和艺术性，才能够充分发挥我们刊物的战斗性和群众性，才能够使我们的刊物更富于教育作用。
    第二、我们要更明确地加强群众观点。根据我军文艺工作的光荣传统，“面向连队”、“为兵服务”的方针，我们曾以显著位置和大量篇幅刊登了来自战士的群众性的文艺创作，如战士快板诗、鼓词、连队的集体创作等。这些战士作品，因为是从丰富的斗争生活中提炼出来的，所以立场是明确的、坚定的；感情是健康的、饱满的；语言是生动的、简练的，现实教育意义是很强的。其中最好的例子，就是战士高玉宝同志的自传小说“高玉宝”。另外我们也发表了自群众中来的批评和建议，这说明我们在编辑工作上对群众性的创作和批评是认真注意的，是大力提倡和培养并号召专业作家向他们学习的。
    但是，从发扬我军文艺工作“面向连队”的优良传统这个问题上来衡量，可以发现我们做得还很不够。如在我们刊物上，有些长篇巨著之不切合实际，针对连队需要，切合连队演唱的材料之少，归结起来，就是群众观点不强的结果。群众观点的不明确，还表现在我们长时期没有很好组织连队阅读的工作。刊物一期一期地出版了，战士和初下级干部接受的程度如何？对他们起了什么教育作用？我们是不十分了解的。我们满足于编辑室里的成绩，而没有积极地组织连队阅读。从思想上检讨，我们虽组织了并用显著地位刊载了战士群众的创作，但我们总多少觉得群众的创作是自然形态的，是粗糙的，我们不是从深刻的阶级本质上来看这一问题，而多少总有些从形式上看这一个问题。因之，我们对群众的创作在群众之间所起的教育作用，就常常是估计不足。
    我们的缺乏群众观点，也表现在我们对基干通讯员的组织工作上。我们习惯于通过军委总政治部文化部的领导，用行政命令去解决问题，却不习惯运用群众性的普遍的坚强的通讯组织去解决问题。事实证明，如果群众性的通讯组织没有建立，没有基础，简单的行政命令常常是不能很好或者全部解决我们编辑工作中间的问题的。特别是对下面实际情况的了解，更不是单依靠行政命令可以办到的，这是一个走群众路线的问题。
    只有坚决地在编辑工作中加强群众观点、走群众路线，才能更好地为兵服务，才能有效地解决普及和提高的问题。
    第三、关于文艺批评的掌握问题。我们没有充分运用布尔什维克批评和自我批评的武器，指导全军的创作思想，改进全军的文艺工作。
    在文艺思想上，创刊以来，我们曾比较坚决地进行过斗争。一方面是大力提倡写正面的、积极的革命英雄形象，同时又严格地批判了小资产阶级“落后到转变”的创作上的公式主义。这个工作是有成绩的，然而却是不足的。对长期盘据在部队中的小资产阶级“落后到转变”的创作上的公式主义，我们曾进行了严肃的斗争，这一斗争是完全正确的。可以说，小资产阶级的“落后到转变”的创作公式，在思想上已经引起普遍的反对，而在作品中也已经逐渐地被克服了。但与此同时，就产生了对某些问题看法上的绝对性，即通过文艺作品，在人民军队内部进行批评和自我批评的工作，就被我们放松了。在反对小资产阶级的“落后到转变”的创作公式的时候，即便这是我军当前创作中主要的倾向，若不同时明确地指出，批判这种小资产阶级的创作公式，并不等于放弃了工人阶级的战斗的武器——批评和自我批评，那显然是不全面的。布尔什维克的批评和自我批评精神，是一个不能降低的原则问题。站稳无产阶级的立场，以无产阶级的满腔热情，用批评和自我批评的精神，创造先进的英雄形象，不仅是允许的，而且也是应该的。否则，就很容易发生错觉，以为描写先进人物，就要把他写成一个简单化的，没有曲折、复杂生长过程的，概念化的人物。实际上，革命现实主义的创作方法告诉我们，一个先进人物正是经过若干曲折、困难而后形成的，经过先进的思想、事物，和落后的思想、事物的不断斗争，英雄才能生长，才能前进，也才能领导读者前进。事物的发展过程总是无产阶级思想观点战胜旧的观点在前进的，现实发展本身也是曲折复杂的，因此文艺作品也应该掌握批评和自我批评的精神，而不是不要批评和自我批评，问题是作者站在什么立场批评和如何进行批评的问题。
    在我们的编辑工作中，我们也曾大力提倡写先进的积极的人物，写革命的英雄形象；并着重指出，英雄人物的精神状态，首先就是建立在对党、对人民、对领袖及对无产阶级事业的无限忠心和信心并克服一切困难的革命乐观主义上面。这种大力提倡是完全正确的，而且也是有成绩的。我们的作者，已经努力在伟大的现实革命斗争生活中，从阶级本质上去认识去表现那些先进的事物，先进的英雄人物了。但与此同时，对那些小资产阶级的反现实的、
    “快乐无边”的、缺乏战斗性的乐观主义，则未从思想上和作品上加以批判，指出其间的原则区别。这样，就很容易使小资产阶级的形式主义乘机抬头。事实上，在写人民军队的作品中也已经有这样的作品出现了。
    “解放军文艺”是部队的文艺刊物，对部队文艺工作的思想领导，有其当然的职责。入城以来，部队的文艺工作，是有成绩的，尤其是战斗在朝鲜前线的文艺工作者，有更大的成绩。但是资产阶级思想的侵蚀，特别是小资产阶级思想的侵蚀，并不是不严重的。“三反”的结果，便看出问题的严重。部队中的某些文艺工作者，在思想上颇为混乱，和人民军队的革命斗争传统，愈来愈远，和资产阶级追求形式，讲究排场的腐蚀气息，却愈来愈近了。有的作者，脱离政治、脱离实际，或则堕落地以长篇巨著歌颂小资产阶级；或则荒唐地以为部队没什么可写，严重脱离政治、脱离群众，对伟大的现实斗争感到厌倦。有的工作单位，把“为兵服务”的明确方针视为纸上空文，认为“面向连队”就是降低自己，应该到城市里去“提高”。我们的编辑工作过去对这种资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的侵蚀，在性质上，在程度上都是估计不足的，因而对这种混乱思想的作战，对这种资产阶级、小资产阶级的腐朽的思想作战也是无力的、不及时的。批评和自我批评这一战斗的武器，在我们的编辑工作中，是运用得不够和不及时的。无论是对文艺思想的指导，无论是对文艺运动的掌握，无论是对具体作品的分析批评，我们都没有充分地作好。虽然，我们在创作思想上，也进行过几次对小资产阶级思想的批判，但就整个看来，和资产阶级、小资产阶级的影响作战，是缺乏周密的计划和部署的。思想领导不强，一方面固然是由于我们认识水平低，但更重要的是由于我们的工人阶级的政治责任感差，由于我们本身就存在着一些非工人阶级的糊涂观念。
    今后，我们的编辑工作，应该从思想上警觉起来，根据“三反”的精神，站稳我们工人阶级的立场，巩固我们为兵服务的观念，勇敢大胆地批判我们过去的错误和缺点，充分发扬我们过去的优点和成绩。依靠领导、依靠群众、依靠我们自己的努力和学习，去改正我们的错误和缺点，使得“解放军文艺”无愧于它自己的称号，真正为广大士兵和干部所热烈爱好，成为以爱国主义和国际主义精神教育人民军队的刊物，成为传播人民解放军的革命英雄主义和先进思想的刊物，成为指导部队文艺思想的刊物。我们愿意和我们广大战士、干部与热爱人民军队的人民，一起努力。我们应时时刻刻记着：只有依靠广大群众的帮助，才能把编辑工作做好，我们诚恳地希望读者经常关心我们的刊物，经常对我们进行批评，并希望能够组织阅读，以便在群众中审查、考验我们的工作。
