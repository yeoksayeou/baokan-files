    Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory Leading Cadres'
    Bureaucratic Work Style Halts Production
    To the Editor: Our Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory ran out of pig iron coke in March. Leading cadres did not actively seek solutions, but only borrowed from other factories. The leading cadres repeatedly delayed and procrastinated until May, when they finally sent technician Li Yuankui to purchase it. Li went to Shanghai to buy it, but the price remained the same, with an additional freight charge of more than 110,000 yuan per ton. Li telegraphed for instructions, and Deputy Factory Director Gu replied, "These coke prices are too expensive, and we cannot account for them, so we cannot accept them!" He only haggled over the freight charge of more than 110,000 yuan per ton, regardless of the factory's production. Now, the factory is using ordinary coke, which has caused great losses in terms of output and quality in the iron casting workshop. From May 3rd to 16th, the iron casting workshop used more than 5,100 jin of coke due to the low iron smelting capacity of ordinary coke. The scrap rate of castings has also greatly increased. The finished products cast by technician Sun Hongwen used to have a 100% quality rate; now, he makes thirty a day, and twenty are scrapped. The entire workshop scrapped more than eight tons of rough castings in twelve days. The cover plate group in the iron casting workshop was also forced to stop work on May 17th due to poor iron liquid quality when smelting with ordinary coke. This results in a daily loss of 360 cover plates. If the stoppage continues until the end of the month, this item alone will lose more than 100 million yuan. In addition, workers often work until after 7 or even 8 o'clock due to the late iron liquid output when using ordinary coke, which seriously affects the workers' health. This is entirely the bad result of leading cadres not paying attention to production. They should quickly change this situation, otherwise, it is unknown how much more loss will be caused to production!　Mo Zhu
    Editor's Note: The leading cadres of the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory have serious bureaucracy, do not care about solving the problem of production raw materials, and do not care about the health of workers. As a result, production has stalled, and some parts have even stopped work, causing significant losses. We hope that the leading cadres of the factory will inform us of the results of the handling of this issue within a week.

### 青岛纺织机器厂领导干部  官僚主义作风使生产停顿

    青岛纺织机器厂领导干部
    官僚主义作风使生产停顿
    编辑同志：我们青岛纺织机器厂所存的化铁焦炭在三月份就用完了，领导干部不积极设法解决，只向别的厂借用。领导干部一再延宕拖拉，直到五月份，才派技术员李元魁出去购买。李到上海去买，价格照旧，每吨要多花车费十一万多元。李来电询问，顾副厂长答说：“这些焦炭价格太贵，无法下账，我们不能要！”他只斤斤较量于每吨十一万多元的车费，而不顾厂里生产。现在，厂里用的是普通焦炭，这使铸铁工场在产量、质量上受到很大损失。从五月三日到十六日，铸铁工场因普通焦炭化铁量低，就多用了焦炭五千一百多斤。铸品的报废率也大大增加了。技工孙洪文所铸的成品，过去质量是百分之一百；现在，一天做三十个，竟废了二十个。全车间在十二天中共报废了八吨多毛胚。铸铁工场盖板组也因普通焦炭化铁时铁汁不良，被迫在五月十七日停工。每日因此少产三百六十根盖板。如停到月底，这一项即损失一亿多元。另外，工人们因用了普通焦炭，出铁汁晚，经常工作到七时多，甚至八时多，严重影响了工人的健康。这完全是领导干部不注意生产所造成的恶果。他们应迅速改变这种情况，否则对生产不知要造成多大损失！　模铸
    编者按：青岛纺织机器厂领导干部有严重的官僚主义，不关心解决生产原料问题，对工人健康也不关心。以致生产停顿，有的部分竟至停工，造成重大损失。我们希望该厂领导干部在一周内告诉我们对这个问题处理的结果。
