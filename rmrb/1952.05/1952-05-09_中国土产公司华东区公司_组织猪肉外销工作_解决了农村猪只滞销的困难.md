    China Native Produce Company East China Branch
    Organizes Pork Export Work
    Resolving Difficulties in Selling Pigs in Rural Areas
    The China Animal By-Products Company has entrusted the East China Native Produce Company to purchase large quantities of fresh pigs from rural areas, slaughter them into white meat, and store them using scientific methods for export to the Soviet Union. From March 23rd to April 19th, exports reached over 65,000 head. This pork export has helped solve the current difficulty in selling pigs in rural areas and encouraged farmers in the producing areas to raise pigs and accumulate manure.
    Raising pigs is a major sideline for the vast rural areas of East China. Farmers raise pigs not only to accumulate production funds from small sums, but also to accumulate large amounts of pig manure for fertilizing fields. Therefore, encouraging farmers to raise more pigs is very important for the current agricultural bumper harvest movement to increase yield per unit area. Last winter, the output of pigs increased greatly in various places, but the consumption of pork in cities was limited. As a result, during the first quarter of this year, there was a surplus of pigs in East China. In addition, illegal merchants took the opportunity to lower prices, and the price of live pigs in producing areas once fell. State-owned companies have carried out purchases and orders, but the sluggish sales situation has not been fully resolved. Farmers sold pigs at low prices, and sometimes it was difficult to sell them, which affected their enthusiasm for raising pigs and accumulating manure.
    The People's Government attaches great importance to this situation. In addition to vigorously coordinating transportation and sales domestically, it also strives to export to solve the problem of sluggish sales. After negotiations between the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the Soviet Commercial Representative, an agreement on the export of fresh pork was signed. Since pork gained a sales channel in the Soviet Union, the East China Native Produce Company has arranged to purchase large quantities in northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and other places. At the same time, in order to take care of the interests of producers, purchase prices were appropriately stipulated according to the specific conditions in various places. For example, in Huangqiao, the price was adjusted from 230,000 yuan per dan to 265,000 yuan per dan in late March. In early April, Lanxi also increased to 257,000 yuan per dan. Due to the large-scale purchases by state-owned companies, the production enthusiasm of farmers has generally stabilized. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国土产公司华东区公司
    组织猪肉外销工作
    解决了农村猪只滞销的困难
    中国畜产公司委托华东土产公司大量收购农村的鲜猪，宰成白肉，用科学方法储藏输往苏联。自三月二十三日到四月十九日，已输出达六万五千余头。这次猪肉的出口，帮助解决了目前农村猪只滞销的困难，鼓励了产区农民养猪积肥的情绪。
    养猪是华东广大农村的主要副业之一。农民养猪，不但可以零钱聚整，累积生产资金，还可以积储大量猪粪肥田。因此，鼓励农民多养猪，对于目前为提高单位面积产量的农业丰产运动关系很大。去年冬季，各地猪只产量大增，但城市猪肉的消费量有限，因而在本年第一季度内，华东各地出现了猪只供应过剩的现象，加上违法商人乘机杀价，产地毛猪价格曾一度下跌。国营公司曾经进行收购和定购，但滞销局面仍未全部打开。农民贱价售猪，有时尚难卖出，因此养猪积肥的情绪受到影响。
    人民政府对这一情况非常重视。除在国内大力调剂运销外，又争取输出，以解决滞销困难。经中央人民政府贸易部与苏联商务代表洽谈，签订了鲜猪肉出口的协议。自猪肉获得苏联销路后，华东土产公司即布置在苏北、苏南、浙江、山东等地大量收购，同时，为了照顾生产者的利益，根据各地具体情况，适当地规定了收购价格。如黄桥在三月下旬由原二十三万元一担，调整为二十六万五千元一担。兰溪在四月初亦提高至每担二十五万七千元。由于国营公司的大量收购，农民生产情绪已普遍安定。    （新华社）
