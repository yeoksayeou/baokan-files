    The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has stipulated that middle school students should listen to the "Domestic and International Major Events" broadcast by the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station daily and hold a current affairs quiz once a month. However, the neglect of current affairs study is still very serious in some middle schools.
    Judging from the current affairs quizzes in various middle schools in April, although the quiz questions were very simple, the results were very poor. Among the 66 first-year senior high school students at the private Chongde Middle School who took the quiz, 56 failed. Among the 45 first-year senior high school students at the private Pingmin Middle School, 39 failed. Among the 37 second-year senior high school students, 33 failed. Among the 57 third-year junior high school students in Class A, only two passed. In the private Datong Middle School, the number of students who failed in each class above the third year of junior high school was more than 60%. Similar situations existed to varying degrees in other middle schools.
    Many students lack the necessary understanding of current important current affairs and policy issues, and even have many confused concepts and erroneous ideas. For example, many students could not answer the content of the International Economic Conference. Twelve out of 38 third-year junior high school students at Peiyuan Middle School answered incorrectly. Some said that the International Economic Conference was "discussing spring plowing and drought prevention issues," etc. Some students also had incorrect understanding of the crimes of American imperialism spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. Since the launch of the Three-Anti Movement, political classes in various schools have focused on policy issues related to the "Three-Anti" Movement, but many students' understanding of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements is still very vague.
    Why has the current affairs study in middle schools not achieved the desired results? According to many readers' letters, there are two reasons: First, some students have incorrect understanding of current affairs study. Some people say: "If you don't study the regular courses well, you will be held back a grade, but it doesn't matter if you don't study current affairs well." Others say: "We study cultural and scientific knowledge in school, and we will study politics after we leave school. There is no need to study politics now." This is because they do not understand the correct relationship between studying politics and studying cultural and scientific knowledge. The other reason, which is also the main reason, is that some school leaders do not pay attention to students' current affairs study. They implement the various regulations of the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education on current affairs study in middle schools in a formalistic way, without checking the effectiveness of students' listening to the radio, without organizing students to conduct research and discussions, without giving students current affairs reports, and even without looking at the papers after the quizzes. They themselves do not attach importance to current affairs study, so they do not care about students' current affairs study. For example, Datong Middle School recently conducted a current affairs quiz among its faculty and staff. Among the 32 teachers who participated in the quiz, 11 failed, and two teachers only scored 15 points. In other schools, some language teachers do not know who the world's four great cultural celebrities are, and history and geography teachers do not know which important water conservancy projects are currently being built in China. They do not study current affairs because they have erroneous ideas, believing that: "I can still teach without studying current affairs." This purely technical viewpoint that does not ask about politics has directly affected young students.
    Readers unanimously believe that strengthening current affairs education in middle schools is an important method to cultivate young people's concern for politics and establish a revolutionary outlook on life, and must be taken seriously by relevant leading organs. To this end, first of all, teachers in various schools are required to correct their attitude towards current affairs study, care about the current affairs study of young students, improve the current formalistic study system, adopt organizational forms suitable for young people's requirements, earnestly conduct current affairs education, and correct the tendency to neglect current affairs study. Secondly, the Communist Youth League and student unions in schools should play a major role in promoting students' interest in current affairs study through various mass organizations, and educate students to realize that only by caring about politics and improving their political consciousness can they make the cultural and scientific knowledge they have learned serve the people well.

### 北京市中等学校学生时事学习的效果很差——读者来信综述

    北京市中等学校学生时事学习的效果很差
    ——读者来信综述
    北京市文教局虽然规定了中等学校学生每日收听北京人民广播电台播送的“国内外大事”和每月举行一次时事测验的制度，但是，忽视时事学习的情况，在某些中学里还十分严重。
    从各中学在四月份的时事测验来看，测验题虽然很简单，但测验的成绩很坏。私立崇德中学高中一年级参加测验的六十六人中，有五十六人不及格；私立平民中学高中一年级四十五人中，有三十九人不及格；高中二年级三十七人中，有三十三人不及格，初中三年级甲班五十七人中，只有两个人及格；私立大同中学初中三年级以上各班不及格的人数，都在百分之六十以上。类似情况在其他中学也或多或少地存在着。
    许多学生对于当前重要的时事和政策问题，缺乏应有的认识，甚至有不少糊涂观念和错误思想。比如：对于国际经济会议的内容，就有不少学生答不上来。培元中学初中三年级三十八人中，有十二人答错了。有人说国际经济会议“在讨论春耕、防旱问题”等。对美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北撒布细菌的罪行，有些学生也有不正确的认识。三反运动开展以来，各校的政治课都以有关“三反”运动的政策问题为主要内容，但是不少同学对于“三反”“五反”运动的认识还是十分模糊。
    为什么中等学校的时事学习没有收到应有的效果呢？从许多读者来信看，有两个原因：一是有些同学对时事学习存在着不正确的认识，有人说：“正课学不好要留级，时事学不好无大关系。”也有人说：“在学校里学文化科学知识，出了学校再学政治，现在学政治用不着。”这是因为他们不了解学习政治和学习文化科学知识的正确关系。另一个原因，也是主要的原因，是有些学校领导方面没有重视学生的时事学习问题。他们形式主义地执行着市文教局关于中等学校时事学习的各种制度，不检查学生收听广播的效果，不组织学生进行研究和讨论，不向学生作时事报告，甚至进行测验后也不看卷子。他们本身就不重视时事学习，所以对同学的时事学习也不关心。如最近大同中学在教职员中进行了一次时事测验。参加测验的三十二个教员中，就有十一人不及格，有两位教员只得了十五分。其他学校中，有的语文教员不知道世界四大文化名人是谁，史地教员不知道目前我国正在兴修那些重要的水利工程。他们不学习时事，是因为他们存在着错误的思想，认为：“我没有学时事还不是一样教书”。这种不问政治的单纯技术观点，已经直接影响到青年学生们了。
    读者一致认为：加强中等学校的时事教育，是培养青年关心政治，树立革命人生观的重要方法，必须引起有关领导机关的重视。为此，首先要求各校教师端正对时事学习的态度，关心青年学生们的时事学习，改进目前某些徒具形式的学习制度，采取适合青年要求的组织形式，认真地进行时事教育，纠正忽视时事学习的偏向。其次，学校中的青年团和学生会应该起主要的推动作用，通过各种群众组织的活动，来培养同学们对时事学习的兴趣，教育同学们认识只有关心政治，提高了政治觉悟，才能使自己所学习的文化和科学知识很好地为人民服务的道理。
