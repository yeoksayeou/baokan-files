    Shandong Kiln Factory Workers
    Successfully Improve Firebrick and Pipe Brick Models
    Comrade Editor: Workers at the Shandong Kiln Factory are finding ways to improve production tools and save a lot of resources. In February, Gao Chengji, Gao Shushi and others in the Carpentry Department jointly studied and transformed the models for firebricks and pipe bricks. Using the modified firebrick model, each worker increased production from 13 bricks to 16 bricks per shift; using the modified pipe brick model, labor can be reduced by half, saving an average of 12 workers per day. The two items together can save the country more than 50 million yuan per year. However, this firebrick model still has great shortcomings. The bricks made with the model go out of shape in less than three days. A model has to be repaired every three days, and after six or seven repairs, it becomes unusable, lasting less than a month in total. An average of more than 30 models have to be made each month. Wang Fangtian of the Carpentry Department and Yang Jintian of the Ironworking Department continued their research and further improved the firebrick model. Now, the improved new model can be used for about a year at a time, which is 15 times longer than the original model. The old models had to be scrapped 360 per year, while the new models only require 24. This saves another 13 million yuan per year.

    山东窑业厂工人
    改进耐火砖管子砖模型成功
    编辑同志：山东窑业厂工人找窍门改进生产工具，节省了很多资财。二月间，木工部高成继、高树实等共同研究，改造了耐火砖和管子砖模型。用改造后的耐火砖模型做砖，每工由原来做十三个提高到十六个；用改造后的管子砖模型做砖，可省一半人工，每天平均能节约十二个人工。两样合计，每年可给国家节约五千多万元。但是，这种耐火砖模型还是有很大缺点的，模型用不到三天，做出来的砖就要走样子。一个模型隔三天修理一次，修理过六、七次就不能用了，总共用不到一个月。每月平均要添制三十多个模型。木工部王芳田和铁工部杨金田继续研究，又改进了耐火砖模型。现在，改进后的新模型一次能用一年左右，比原来模型的寿命长十五倍。旧模型每年得报废三百六十个，新模型每年只用二十四个就够了。每年因此又节约了一千三百多万元。
