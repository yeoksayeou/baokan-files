    Basic Construction Department of Chuandong 103 Factory:
    Poorly Planned Construction Project Causes Waste
    To the Editor: The blast furnace workshop of the Chuandong 103 Factory is located on a hillside, separated from the main production workshop by a railway line, which is inconvenient for transportation and hinders production. Therefore, the factory's Basic Construction Department decided to relocate the equipment and build a new blast furnace plant. The original plan was to start construction in October last year and complete it in March this year. According to this plan, the factory transported a batch of raw materials back from Chongqing in August last year and stored them separately in the new and old blast furnace plants.
    The blueprint for the blast furnace plant was completed by the Southwest State-Owned Construction Company as early as June last year. The responsible cadres of the Basic Construction Department believed that the safety factor designed by the construction company was too high and cost too much money, and wanted to design their own blueprint. However, they lacked construction personnel, so the blueprint for the blast furnace plant has not been designed yet. This has delayed the start of the construction project. In addition, the cost of transporting production raw materials back and forth is 9,000 yuan per ton, which also wastes a lot of transportation costs. The responsible cadres of the Basic Construction Department did not plan the project carefully, delayed the construction of the project, and did not seize the time to actively solve the problem. This is the main reason for the waste.

### 川东一○三厂基本建设科  修建工程计划不周造成浪费

    川东一○三厂基本建设科
    修建工程计划不周造成浪费
    编辑同志：川东一○三厂鼓风炉车间设在山坡上，和主要生产车间相隔一条铁路，往来不方便，生产受到妨碍。因此，该厂基本建设科决定搬迁设备，修建新的鼓风炉工场。这一修建工程原计划去年十月动工，今年三月完成。根据这个计划，该厂去年八月从重庆运回一批原料，分别存放在新、旧鼓风炉工场。
    鼓风炉工场的图样，早在去年六月已由西南国营建筑公司设计完成。基本建设科的负责干部认为建筑公司设计的安全系数太大，花钱太多，想自己设计图样。但他们又缺乏建筑人材，致鼓风炉工场的图样拖到现在还没有设计出来。这就耽误了修建工程的动工。另外，来回搬运生产原料，每吨力资需要九千元，也浪费很多运输费。基本建设科负责干部对工程的计划不周密，耽误了工程的修建，也不抓紧时间主动解决，这是造成浪费的主要原因。
