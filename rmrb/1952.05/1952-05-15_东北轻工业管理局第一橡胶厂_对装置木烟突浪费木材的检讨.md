    Northeast Light Industry Bureau No. 1 Rubber Factory
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Waste of Wood in Installing Wooden Chimneys

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Sun Hongtao on April 9th, criticizing our factory for installing wooden chimneys and wasting national timber. We accept this criticism. Last year, our factory built 137 new Class C dormitories, totaling 508 households. We did not construct according to the construction drawings of the Northeast Industrial Department, and arbitrarily changed eight chimneys into four chimneys. The chimneys were very thin and easily blocked, and poisoning accidents occurred frequently in winter. Because our leading cadres have a bureaucratic style, this serious situation has persisted for a long time, and it was not until the "Three-Anti" campaign that it came to our attention. We convened a meeting of the factory management committee and decided to temporarily use wooden chimneys as a remedy, and replace them when the weather warmed up. In this repair project, we used 31.1 cubic meters of wood, wasting national funds. This is not in line with the spirit of the State Council's directive on saving wood. All of these deserve our deep self-criticism and vigilance. We thank the readers for their help and guarantee that similar mistakes will not happen again in the future.

    对装置木烟突浪费木材的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报四月九日刊载了读者孙洪涛的来信，批评我厂装置木烟突，浪费国家木材。我们接受这个意见。去年，我厂新建丙种宿舍一百三十七栋，共五百零八户。我们没有按东北工业部施工图纸施工，擅自把八个烟突改为四个烟突，烟突很细，容易阻塞，冬天经常发生中毒事故。因为我们领导干部有官僚主义作风，使这一严重情况存在很久，一直到“三反”期间，才引起我们的注意。我们召开了工厂管理委员会会议，决定暂时以木烟突来补救，到天气稍暖时，即行更换。在这次补修工程中，我们用了三十一点一立方公尺木材，浪费了国家的资金。这是不符合政务院节约木材指示的精神的。这些都值得我们深刻检讨和警惕。我们感谢读者的帮助，保证今后不再发生类似错误。
