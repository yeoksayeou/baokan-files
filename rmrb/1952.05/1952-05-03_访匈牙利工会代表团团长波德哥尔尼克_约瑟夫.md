Interview with József Podgórnik, Head of the Hungarian Trade Union Delegation

József Podgórnik, the head of the Hungarian Trade Union Delegation who was invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, is the son of a coal miner. At the age of fifteen, he went down the mine to work with his father. He joined the workers' movement in 1919. In 1925, he joined the Communist Party (the predecessor of the current Hungarian Working People's Party). He was arrested in 1927; after ten months in prison, he accepted the Party's instructions to organize workers' strikes. From 1930, he was forced to live in the Soviet Union for eleven years. After the liberation of Hungary, he returned to his homeland, continued to lead the national coal miners' movement, and was elected as the chairman of the All-Hungarian Miners' Union, which he still holds. In 1947 and 1949, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly twice. In 1951, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

József Podgórnik arrived in Beijing by plane on the afternoon of April 29th. Twenty-four hours later, he cordially received the reporter. Although his time in Beijing was still short, the impression the new Chinese capital made on him was very profound. He described it as "seeing a vivid and powerful picture." He said that he watched the film "The Great Unity of the Chinese Nation" on the night he arrived in Beijing, and he deeply felt the joy of life and the close unity of all ethnic groups in China. He also saw the youth teams gathered in Tiananmen Square rehearsing parades to welcome "May Day," and he enthusiastically said: "This is a very powerful force. Such a force belongs not only to Beijing but also to the world's peace camp!"

The Chinese people have seen the achievements of Hungarian cultural construction from the excellent national art performances of the Hungarian State People's Ensemble. From the conversation with Head of Delegation József Podgórnik, we realized that the rapidly developing Hungarian economic construction is constantly enriching the foundation for cultural construction. He said: "Agricultural Hungary has become a thing of the past forever; Hungary is an industrial country." The five-year plan for peaceful construction is now entering its third year and second quarter. The industrial production results for the first quarter of this year (January to March) have already been summarized, and the Hungarian working-class brothers not only completed the assigned tasks but also overfulfilled them: coal at 101.3%; ferrous metals at 103.6%; machine tools at 100.2%; electricity at 102.2%; building materials at 105.1%; chemicals at 102.2%; heavy industry at 102.1%... These brilliant achievements illustrate how the Hungarian people are opening up a path to socialism with a high degree of patriotism; at the same time, they vividly express their patriotic spirit. He said that when mainland China was not yet fully liberated, the Hungarian Working People's Party and the government organized the masses to work hard to produce and introduced them to the situation of the Chinese people's struggle. In this way, the Hungarian people understood the significance of increasing labor productivity: on the one hand, to consolidate their own country, and at the same time to help the Chinese people accelerate the struggle for liberation. The liberated Hungarian people are thus engaged in peaceful construction on the basis of a combination of patriotism and internationalism. The Hungarian People's Volunteer Medical Team serving on the front lines of the Korean War against US aggression is familiar and admired by people all over the world. When the Chinese Youth Art Troupe returned from a visit to Hungary, they mentioned that the Hungarian steelworkers had produced a large number of railway steel rails for our country; now Head of Delegation József Podgórnik told reporters that the Hungarian working-class brothers have recently produced a large number of motorcycles and various industrial machines, ready to supply China. As he said, the Hungarian working class loves the Chinese people very much, and the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people will become closer and more consolidated in the ideal of defending world peace and jointly striving to realize a communist society!

    访匈牙利工会代表团团长波德哥尔尼克·约瑟夫
    应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的匈牙利工会代表团团长波德哥尔尼克·约瑟夫是煤矿工人之子，十五岁时就下煤矿和他父亲在一起做工。一九一九年起，他参加了工人运动。一九二五年参加了共产党（即现在匈牙利劳动人民党的前身）。一九二七年被捕；过了十个月的牢狱生活之后，接受党的指示，组织工人罢工。一九三○年起被迫侨居苏联十一年。匈牙利解放后，他回到祖国，继续领导全国煤矿工人运动，并被选为全匈矿工工会主席，直到现在。一九四七和一九四九年，他两次当选为国会议员。一九五一年他当选为匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员。
    波德哥尔尼克·约瑟夫是四月二十九日下午乘飞机到达北京的。二十四小时之后，他亲切地接待了记者。这时，他到北京的时间虽然还很短，但新中国首都给他的印象却是非常深刻的。他形容这是“看了一幅生动有力的图画”。他说，到北京的当晚看了“中华民族大团结”的影片，他深切地体会到中国各民族生活的欢乐和团结的紧密。他又看到了集合在天安门广场演习游行迎接“五一”的青年队伍，他热情横溢地说：“这是非常有力量的队伍。这样的力量不仅属于北京，而且是全世界和平阵营的力量！”
    中国人民从匈牙利国家人民文工团的优秀的民族艺术演出中，看到了匈牙利文化建设的成就。从波德哥尔尼克·约瑟夫团长的谈话中，我们认识到飞跃发展中的匈牙利经济建设正不断地为文化建设充实了基础。他说：“农业的匈牙利已经永远成为过去，匈牙利是工业国了。”在和平建设的五年计划中，现在正进入第三年第二季度。今年第一季度（一至三月份）工业生产成绩已经作出总结，匈牙利工人阶级弟兄不但是完成了规定的任务，而且是超额完成了——煤百分之一百零一点三；黑色金属百分之一百零三点六；工作母机百分之一百零点二；电力百分之一百零二点二；建筑器材百分之一百零五点一；化工百分之一百零二点二；重工业百分之一百零二点一……这些光辉的业绩，说明着匈牙利人民如何以高度爱国主义精神为走向社会主义开辟了前程；同时，也生动地表现了他们的爱国主义精神。他说，当中国大陆还没有完全解放时，匈牙利劳动人民党和政府就组织群众努力生产，并向他们介绍中国人民斗争的情况。这样，匈牙利人民都懂得了提高劳动生产率的意义：一方面是为着巩固自己的国家，同时也就是帮助中国人民加速争取解放。解放了的匈牙利人民，就是这样在爱国主义和国际主义相结合的基础上从事和平建设的。在抗美援朝前线服务的匈牙利人民志愿医疗队是全世界人民所熟悉所景仰的。中国青年出国文工团代表从匈牙利访问归来时，曾谈到匈牙利炼钢工人弟兄为我国生产了大批铁路钢轨；现在波德哥尔尼克·约瑟夫团长又告诉记者：匈牙利工人阶级弟兄最近又生产了大批机器脚踏车和各种工业机器，准备供应中国。正如他所说的，匈牙利工人阶级非常热爱中国人民，中匈两国人民所结成的兄弟般友谊，将在保卫世界和平和为实现共产主义社会共同奋斗的理想中，更加密切、巩固！  （谢蔚明）（附图片）
