    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th Dispatch: Ninety thousand American oil workers began a nationwide strike on April 29th at midnight, cutting U.S. national oil production by half and creating a widespread oil shortage. The oil workers are striking to demand a wage increase of 25 cents per hour and higher night shift allowances. Negotiations on the wage increase have been going on for three months, but the capitalists have consistently refused to agree to the workers' reasonable demands.
    Shortly after the strike began, many gas stations began to run out of gasoline. As of May 4th, gasoline supplies in Detroit, an important industrial center, had been reduced by 70 percent, and more than half of the city's 3,000 gas stations either had no gasoline or had to ration it. This is the first such phenomenon since World War II. In Chicago, hundreds of buses have stopped running. Faced with this oil shortage, Truman, after ordering a halt to all gasoline exports to foreign countries (except Canada) on the 1st, ordered on the 4th that civilian aviation fuel be reduced by 30 percent starting from the 6th.
    The reduction in oil supplies not only affects the relevant transportation sectors, but also undermines the U.S.'s expansion of armaments and war preparations. After the strike began, officials of the U.S. Defense Petroleum Administration declared that the supply of aviation fuel for the Air Force was in a "dangerous state." On May 2nd, the U.S. Air Force Department ordered a reduction in military flights for all U.S. troops except those in the Korean war zone, and ordered 40 air force training bases across the country to reduce fuel consumption to a minimum. The Associated Press admitted: "The American oil workers' strike has currently paralyzed the U.S. Air Force's training program." For example, the Air Force Technical Training Center at the Denver Air Force Base in Colorado announced that it had been ordered to stop all routine flights.
    At the same time as the oil workers' strike, the issue of wage increases for 650,000 steelworkers remains unresolved. A wage conference convened by Truman himself at the White House, with representatives of the union and major U.S. steel companies, has been adjourned indefinitely without any results.

### 美国九万名石油工人举行全国性大罢工

    美国九万名石油工人举行全国性大罢工
    【新华社六日讯】纽约消息：美国九万名石油工人从四月二十九日午夜起开始了全国规模的大罢工，使美国全国石油产量减少一半，并已造成普遍的油荒。石油工人罢工是为了要求达到每小时增加工资二角五分和提高夜班津贴的目的。关于增加工资的谈判已进行了三个月，资方始终不愿答应工人的这个合理要求。
    罢工开始后不久，许多地方的加油站就已缺乏汽油。到五月四日为止，重要工业中心底特律的汽油供应已减少了百分之七十，该城三千加油站中有一半以上不是没有油就是不得不实行配给，这是自从第二次世界大战以来第一次发生的现象。在芝加哥，数百辆公共汽车已停驶。在这种油荒的情况下，杜鲁门继一日下令停止对外国（加拿大除外）的一切汽油出口之后，又于四日下令自六日起减少民用航空用油量百分之三十。
    石油供应的减少不但影响到有关的运输部门，而且还使美国的扩军备战计划遭受到打击。罢工开始后，美国国防石油管理局官员即宣告空军飞行油料的供应已处于“危险状态”。五月二日，美国空军部下令减少除朝鲜战区以外所有美国军队的军事飞行，同时命令全国四十个空军训练基地把用油量减少到最低限度。合众社承认：“美国石油工人的大罢工，目前已瘫痪了美国空军的训练计划。”例如，科罗拉多州丹佛一空军基地的空军技术训练中心即曾宣布，它已奉命停止所有日常的飞行。
    与石油工人罢工同时，六十五万钢铁工人要求增加工资的问题仍然僵持未决。由杜鲁门亲自出面召集工会及美国大钢铁公司的负责人在白宫举行的工资会议，已因未得任何结果而宣布无限期休会。
