    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th TASS dispatch: U.S. President Truman delivered a hostile speech against the Soviet Union at a press conference in Washington on April 24th this year, and even insisted that he had issued an "ultimatum" to the Soviet Union in 1946, demanding that Soviet troops withdraw from Iran. The absurdity of this remark was obvious from the beginning, because when reporters inquired about the content of the so-called "ultimatum," Truman was unable to answer. The White House spokesman, Tabe, had to declare on the same day that no ultimatum had actually been issued to the Soviet Union.
    To this end, TASS is authorized to declare that the aforementioned remarks by Mr. Truman regarding the so-called "ultimatum" are completely fabricated and are clearly intended to increase American war hysteria. As for the true facts of the Soviet army's withdrawal from Iran in 1946, they were made public at the time. The Soviet army withdrew from Iran precisely in accordance with the schedule stipulated in the agreement between the Soviet and Iranian governments.

    塔斯社斥杜鲁门造谣
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：今年四月二十四日美国总统杜鲁门在华盛顿记者招待会上发表敌视苏联的谈话，并且还硬说他曾于一九四六年向苏联提出“最后通牒”，要求苏联军队撤出伊朗。这种言论的荒谬无稽从一开头就是很明显的，因为当记者们询问所谓“最后通牒”的内容时，杜鲁门瞠目不能答复，白宫的发言人塔贝不得不于当天声明，实际上并没有向苏联提出任何最后通牒。
    为此塔斯社受权声明，上述杜鲁门先生关于所谓
    “最后通牒”的谈话是彻头彻尾虚构的，显然是为了增加美国的战争歇斯底里。至于苏军一九四六年撤出伊朗的真情实况，当时即已公诸于世，苏联军队是准确地按照苏伊两国政府的协议所规定的时间撤出伊朗的。
