    The Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council passed a resolution commemorating the anniversaries of great cultural figures, suggesting that countries hold commemorations this year for the 150th anniversary of Hugo's birth, the 500th anniversary of Da Vinci's birth, the 100th anniversary of Gogol's death, and the 1000th anniversary of Avicenna's birth.

    The Chinese cultural circles and the Chinese people accepted this suggestion with excitement. We have already commemorated these great scientists, writers, and artists separately in national newspapers and magazines. Today, the Chinese people are holding a grand and solemn memorial meeting in their capital for these four cultural giants; prominent international guests—contemporary world-renowned peace fighters, famous scientists, writers, and artists—are also attending the memorial meeting.

    The brilliant names of these four cultural giants and their great creative works have long been admired by the Chinese people. The Chinese people have long been familiar with them. In our great struggle for peace and democratic progress, in the creation of the new culture of the people, their immortal achievements and the brilliant traces of their lives have given us encouragement and inspiration in various ways.

    We recognize the great writer Victor Hugo as a great conscience of the progressive people of France; we deeply respect the spirit of democracy, humanitarianism, and the desire for a rational future for mankind expressed in Hugo's works and his life's work. We are familiar with Leonardo da Vinci, the outstanding genius of the Italian Renaissance; in him, we see the infinite creative talent of mankind and the endless power of progress. The genius writer of the great Russian nation, Gogol, makes us feel especially close. For a long time, Gogol, as a patriot, as a sympathizer of the oppressed people, and as a relentless attacker of dark politics, has been loved and cherished by us, and this has not diminished to this day. As for Avicenna, the great thinker, scientist, and physician of the Tajik people of Central Asia, who was born a thousand years ago, he is the crystallization of the brilliant Arab Islamic culture of the Middle Ages; we admire his intelligence, erudition, and multifaceted talents, especially his spirit of daring exploration and innovation in science.

    These four cultural giants are the glory of the French people, the glory of the Italian people, the glory of the Russian people, and the glory of the Tajik people. But their achievements are not limited to their own nations. Anyone who engages in creative labor for the benefit of mankind and for a better and happier future for mankind, and who explores and defends the truth, regardless of which nation he comes from, can and should be thanked by all progressive mankind.

    The general treasury of human culture throughout the world is accumulated by the diligent efforts of people of all nations and all eras. On the one hand, each nation has its own unique historical traditions, unique way of life, and psychological state, and thus can bring cultural products with its own national characteristics through its own labor and wisdom. On the other hand, all nations are fully capable of understanding each other, and each nation cherishes its own cultural products and can also appreciate and accept the contributions of others. From this, it can be seen that if the cultural development of all nations and the cultural exchanges between all nations are not hindered by anyone and can proceed smoothly, then all the intelligence and talent of mankind can be used to increase the welfare of mankind, and all nations can live in harmony and mutual understanding, and the total treasury of human culture will be infinitely enriched due to the full development of the culture of each nation. For many years, good people have held such beautiful hopes for the future of human life, and the fact that people all over the world are jointly commemorating these four cultural giants this year proves that this hope is reasonable and not impossible to realize.

    The reactionary ideas spread by the American imperialists in the world are precisely the opposite of this rational hope. The American imperialists are doing their best to spread narrow-minded nationalist ideas and concepts of discrimination and hostility between nations, and are trying to block the free exchange between nations in economic and cultural life. The American imperialists are also trying to prove that the Anglo-Saxon race is superior to all other races, and that the "colored" races are inherently inferior. Starting from the fascist racist viewpoint, they attribute the development of world culture to some "superior" nations, and according to them, naturally Americans are the first such
    "Superior" nations. In coordination with this absurd and reactionary concept, wherever the American imperialists' power reaches, they spare no effort to destroy the excellent cultural products of the people of every nation that have their own characteristics, and replace them with so-called "American culture" and "American way of life." In the so-called "American culture" of the imperialist murderers, art has degenerated into the performance of pornographic maniacs, and science has degenerated into the manufacture of weapons of mass collective killing. The American imperialists want to rely on this sinful and corrupt thing that insults the dignity of human culture to create his so-called unified "world culture."

    No one believes that the American imperialists' arrogant plan can be realized. Because no one believes that the cultural treasures accumulated by mankind for many years will be wiped out by the imperialists' sinful black hands. The realization of this hope that all nations live in harmony and jointly develop human culture is not more distant today than in any past era, but is rather closer. Because if this hope was often just a vague imagination in the hearts of good people in the past, now it has become the goal of the actual struggle of hundreds of millions of people around the world. Now that people all over the world are jointly commemorating Hugo, Da Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna, it is precisely under these great names that represent the excellent traditions of human culture that we solemnly declare a struggle against the criminals who dare to slaughter human culture, dare to destroy the free exchange of cultures between nations, and dare to block the path of human progress!

### 为保卫人类文化的优秀传统而斗争  ——纪念雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理和阿维森纳

    为保卫人类文化的优秀传统而斗争
    ——纪念雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理和阿维森纳
    世界和平理事会的维也纳会议，通过了纪念伟大的文化巨人周年的决议，建议各国在今年举行雨果诞生一百五十周年纪念，达·芬奇诞生五百周年纪念，果戈理逝世一百周年纪念，阿维森纳诞生一千周年纪念。
    中国的文化界和中国人民，以兴奋的情绪接受了这一个建议。我们已经分别地在全国的报纸、杂志上面纪念了这些伟大的科学家、文学家和艺术家。今天，中国人民更在自己的首都为这四个文化巨人举行盛大的、隆重的纪念会；在纪念会上，并有国际贵宾——当代世界著名的和平战士、著名的科学家、文学家和艺术家前来参加。
    这四位文化巨人的光辉的名字及其伟大的创造事业，素为中国人民所敬仰。中国人民早已熟悉他们。在我们为和平与民主进步事业的伟大斗争中，在人民的新文化的创造中，他们的不朽事业及其生平的灿烂的战迹，曾经从各个不同的方面，给了我们鼓舞和激励。
    对于伟大的文豪维克多·雨果，我们是把他当作法国进步人民的一颗巨大的良心来认识的；我们十分尊重在雨果的作品及其一生事业中所表现出来的民主主义、人道主义的精神和对人类的合理前途的渴望。我们熟识那产生于意大利文艺复兴时期的杰出的天才——多才多艺的辽奥纳多·达·芬奇；在他的身上，我们看到了人类无穷的创造才能和永无止境的进步力量。伟大俄罗斯民族的天才作家果戈理尤其使我们感到亲切。长久以来，果戈理作为一个爱国主义者，作为一个被压迫人民的同情者和黑暗政治的无情的攻击者，一直为我们所爱好和珍视，至今没有减退。至于诞生在一千年前的中亚细亚塔吉克族的大思想家、科学家与医学家阿维森纳，他是中世纪灿烂的阿拉伯回教文化的结晶；我们赞美他的聪明渊博的多方面的才学，尤其赞美他在科学上的勇于探求与勇于革新的精神。
    这四位文化巨人，是法兰西人民的光荣，是意大利人民的光荣，是俄罗斯人民的光荣，是塔吉克人民的光荣。但他们的功绩又不仅限于他们自己的民族。凡是为了人类的福利，为了人类的更美好幸福的将来而从事创造性的劳动，探求与保卫真理的人，不管来自那一个民族，都能够，也应该得到全体进步人类的感谢。
    全世界人类文化的总仓库是由各民族各时代的人的辛勤努力的结果所累积而成的。一方面，每一个民族都有其独特的历史传统，独特的生活方式与心理状态，因而都能够凭自己的劳动与智慧带来具有自己的民族特色的文化产物。另一方面，各民族是完全能够互相理解的，每一个民族宝爱自己的文化产物，也能够欣赏和接受别人的贡献。由此可见，如果各民族的文化发展与各民族间的文化交流不受到任何人为的阻挠，而能够顺畅地进行，那么人类的一切聪明才智都能够用在人类福利的增长上，各民族间就能够在互相理解中和睦相处，人类文化的总库藏也将因每一个民族的文化的充分发展而无限量地丰富起来。多少年代来，善良人民对于人类生活的将来都抱着这样的美好的希望，今年全世界人民共同纪念这四位文化巨人这件事本身就证明，这种希望是合理的，而且并不是不可以实现的。
    美帝国主义者在世界上所传播的反动观念，恰恰和这种合理的希望相反，美帝国主义者竭力散播狭隘的民族主义思想和民族间的歧视与敌视的观念，力图阻塞各民族间在经济生活与文化生活上的自由交往。美帝国主义者又力图证明盎格鲁—撒克逊人种优于其他一切种族，而“有色”的人种是天生处于劣等的地位。他们从法西斯的种族主义观点出发，把世界文化的发展都归功于某一些“优等”的民族，而按照他们说来，自然美国人首先就是这种
    “优等”的民族，和这种荒谬的反动观念相配合，美帝国主义者在其势力所到之处，不遗余力地摧毁每一个民族中的带有自己的特点的优秀的人民性的文化产物，而代之以所谓“美国的文化”与“美国的生活方式”。在帝国主义者杀人犯所谓的“美国文化”中，艺术已经堕落到色情狂的表演，科学已经堕落为集体杀人武器的制造。美帝国主义者就是想依靠这种沾辱了人类文化尊严的罪恶的腐朽的东西来制造他所谓统一的“世界文化”。
    没有人相信美帝国主义者的这种狂妄打算能够实现。因为没有人相信人类多少年代来积累起来的文化宝藏会被帝国主义者的罪恶的黑手所一笔勾销。一切民族和睦共处，共同发展人类文化的这种希望的实现，在今天并不比过去任何时代更为遥远，反而是更加接近了。因为如果这种希望在过去的时代里常常不过是在善良的人们的心中怀抱着的一种渺茫的想像，那么现在它已成为全世界以亿计的广大人民的实际斗争的目标了。现在全世界人民一致纪念雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳，正是在这几个足以代表人类文化的优秀传统的伟大名字下面，向那胆敢杀戮人类的文化，胆敢破坏各民族文化的自由交流，胆敢阻塞人类进步的大道的凶犯们宣布庄严的斗争！
