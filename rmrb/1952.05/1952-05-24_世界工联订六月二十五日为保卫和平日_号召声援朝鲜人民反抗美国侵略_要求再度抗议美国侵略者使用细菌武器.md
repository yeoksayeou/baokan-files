Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 22nd: According to TASS, the World Federation of Trade Unions has issued an appeal to the working people of the world, urging them to declare June 25th, 1952, as an international day of active solidarity with the heroic Korean people, namely the Day for the Defense of Peace. The appeal to the working people of the world states: "June 25th of this year marks the second anniversary since the American imperialists subjected the Korean people to terrible suffering. This day will also mark the second anniversary of the Korean people's heroic resistance against the American aggressors. On this day, the working people of the world will pay tribute to the unwavering resistance of their Korean brothers and sisters, which will certainly lead to the failure of imperialist aggression. In the struggle to defend their homeland, the Korean people, with the help of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, have provided an example of unwavering struggle against acts of aggression." The appeal to the working people of the world then strongly condemns the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China, and emphasizes that the World Federation of Trade Unions is convinced that on June 25th of this year, the working people of the world will express full solidarity with the Korean and Chinese people and will once again express firm protest against the American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons.
