Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily Readers

    Fourth Joint Clinic of the Central Ministry of Health
    Review of the Death of Zhang Ming's Child

    Editor,
    The People's Daily published a letter from comrades Li Jianfei and Zhang Ming on February 7, criticizing our hospital's bureaucratic work style. The incident occurred as follows: At 1:30 PM on January 22, Comrade Zhang Ming came to our hospital's pediatrics department requesting a doctor to make a house call. Dr. Tian Jindang was in the clinic at the time and unable to go, so he asked about the child's condition. Comrade Zhang Ming said the child did not have a fever, but had a cough, although it was not serious. Dr. Tian prescribed two kinds of medicine for her to take back. At 6:45 PM, Comrade Li Jianfei called requesting a pediatrician to make a house call. We replied that the pediatrician had not yet returned from making house calls, and would go after returning. At 7:00 PM, he called again, and we gave the same reply as before. He called a third time, saying that the child was seriously ill and requested hospitalization. We asked them to bring the child in immediately, but waited for a long time and the child did not arrive. At 9:00 PM, they called and said the child had died.

    This incident shows that our medical staff were negligent, careless, and irresponsible. More wrongly, no house call was made after the clinic hours, which shows irresponsibility for the patient's life. When they called, although they specifically requested a pediatrician, we should have sent another doctor according to the severity of the illness, instead of handling it mechanically and ignoring it because the pediatrician was not available, which also shows a lack of concern for the patient's life. When they called for the third time, they said the child's condition was serious, and we should have immediately sent a doctor to make a house call, and then decided whether the child should come to the hospital. But we only considered that the child's serious condition warranted hospitalization, and neglected whether the child's life was in danger at that time.

    After the incident, our hospital immediately convened a meeting of all medical staff for self-criticism. After the Beijing University School of Medicine conducted an autopsy and the doctors studied it, we will make further self-criticism and explanation. But one point must be clarified here: Zhang Ming's child's discharge from the hospital was requested by Zhang Ming himself, not ordered by our hospital.

### 中央卫生部第四联合门诊部  对张明的孩子死亡事件的检讨

    中央卫生部第四联合门诊部
    对张明的孩子死亡事件的检讨
    编辑同志：二月七日人民日报刊登了李剑飞、张明同志批评我院的官僚主义作风的来信。事情发生的经过是这样的：一月二十二日下午一时半，张明同志来我院儿科请大夫出诊。田金党大夫因在门诊，不能前去，当即问孩子的病情。张明同志说孩子不发烧，咳嗽，但不严重。田大夫就开了两种药交她带回。下午六时三刻李剑飞同志来电话请儿科大夫出诊，我们回答他说：儿科大夫出诊还没有回来，回来后就去。七时，他又来电话，我们仍以前面所说的话答复。他第三次来电话时说孩子病重，请求入院，我们当时就要他们把孩子送来，但是等了很久也不见孩子来。到了九时多，他们来电话说孩子已死了。
    这一事件说明我们的医务工作者是疏忽大意、不负责任的。更错误的是门诊完了也没有去出诊，这是对病人生命不负责任的表现。在他们来电话时，虽指明要儿科大夫，但是我们应该根据病情轻重，另派大夫前去，不应机械处理，因儿科大夫不在就不加理睬，以致延误时间，这也是对病人生命不关心的表现。在他们第三次来电话时，已说孩子病情严重，我们当时应该立刻派大夫前去出诊，而后决定孩子应否来院。但是我们只考虑孩子病情严重则住院，而忽略了孩子生命当时是否会发生危险。
    事情发生后，我院即已召集全体医务人员开会检讨。等到北京大学医学院进行尸体检验、经过大夫们研究后，我们再作进一步的检讨和说明。但这里有一点是必须加以说明的，张明同志孩子的出院，是张明自己请求的，并非我院命令出院的。    中央卫生部第四联合门诊部
