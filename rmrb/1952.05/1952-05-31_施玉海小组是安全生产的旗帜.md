    Shi Yuhai Group is a Banner of Safe Production
    Chen Zhen
    The Shi Yuhai Group of the Fuguo No. 3 Mine of the Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China is a nationally renowned safe production group. From the liberation in June 1947 to the present, almost five years, the Shi Yuhai Group has never had a fatal or serious injury accident, and has overfulfilled the state's production tasks every year and every season. Therefore, over the years, the Shi Yuhai Group has received 15 awards and become a banner of safe production in the coal mining industry.
    Xi'an Coal Mine is a super-gassy mine with brittle coal that is prone to spontaneous combustion. Under these objective conditions, why is the Shi Yuhai Group able to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries? This is because the Shi Yuhai Group actively and proactively carries out unremitting struggles against various accidents. Shi Yuhai combines his many years of operational experience with various scientific and technical regulations, grasps the changing laws of various production conditions underground, and has scientific foresight for various accidents. Therefore, he can conscientiously implement safety regulations, adopt scientific and standardized operation methods and strict management systems, and strive to create conditions for safe operation in every operation of every type of work.
    Based on the conditions of their own working face, the Shi Yuhai Group strives to prevent various major accidents in all aspects. For example, in order to prevent gas explosion accidents, the Shi Yuhai Group strictly implements the gas inspection system. After the surveyor checks the gas content every day, they write the results of the observation on the pillar and mark the date; in this way, on the one hand, the surveyor's sense of responsibility is improved, and on the other hand, the workers working underground can grasp the gas situation. After each blasting, the gas situation must be checked again. They blast four times a shift, and they must check the gas situation four times (other groups generally only check once or twice). Coupled with strict management of ventilation work, the Shi Yuhai Group has been able to basically control gas and prevent combustion and explosion. Roof fall (that is, the collapse of rocks or coal blocks on the top or coal wall of the coal mining site) is the most common accident underground. The Shi Yuhai Group pays great attention to roof management. After each blasting, workers must call out "top and side" (check the top and coal wall conditions, and if there is a possibility of collapse somewhere, deal with it immediately), then pick the top, trim the sides, and pull the bottom (that is, remove the loose coal on the top, coal wall, and bottom), so that the roadway specifications are neat and conform to the standards of regular operations, which is convenient for the use of finished wood supports. When building stone support tops, they must sweep away the loose coal and find a hard bottom. Because if the stone support is built on loose coal, it cannot effectively resist the pressure of the roof and is prone to roof fall accidents. According to safety regulations, a certain number of wood supports must be prepared in pit wells where wood support transportation is not mechanized before coal mining can begin. Therefore, it often happens that they dare not blast or load coal because the wood support supply cannot keep up. The coal quality of Shi Yuhai's working face is loose and brittle, and the support work is even more important. They stipulate that everyone must carry a wood support when going down the well, which solves the difficulty of support work. In terms of filling, when mining the second or third layer of coal, the top must be picked thoroughly and more stones must be placed, so that the stones in the filling part are dense in order to effectively manage the roof, and at the same time concentrate the air volume on the working face to dilute the gas. Coal dust often flies on the working face, which not only hinders the health of the workers, but also easily causes coal dust explosions. The Shi Yuhai Group strictly implemented the watering system, and watered once before and after each blasting in order to suppress the coal dust and avoid sparks during blasting that could cause a coal dust explosion. At the same time, sprayers are set up in the tunnels to regularly spray mist, water, or powder to prevent coal dust from burning. The working face of the Shi Yuhai Group is well-ordered. In this way, the workers can immediately detect any signs of an accident. The wood supports and stone supports on their working face are all in a straight line, the coal bins and coal unloading openings and water ditches are regularly cleaned; the blaster must shout a number when blasting; the wood supports must be handled gently when transporting them, and so on. The Shi Yuhai Group never neglects these small places. They understand that when producing underground, paying attention to safety work at all times, accidents can definitely be avoided; if there is any negligence, accidents can happen at any time.
    The Shi Yuhai Group implements a strict division of labor and dedicated responsibility system, but can also cooperate organically. Entering the working face of the Shi Yuhai Group is like entering a modern machine shop, with various operation specifications neat, and the workers working in a tense and coordinated manner, which is really well-organized. The workers strive to complete their tasks according to the requirements of the operating procedures according to the instructions on the charts. Similarly, they fully understand that if any type of work lags behind in coal mining work, it will affect the completion of the entire work and even cause accidents. Therefore, necessary and appropriate staggered mutual assistance can be carried out between various types of work. In the process of staggered mutual assistance, they also pay attention to solving the weakest and most critical links. In the case where the progress of each type of work cannot be completely consistent, this method of staggered mutual assistance can make each type of work closely connected and avoid the phenomenon of disconnection and idle work.
    In order to implement the policy of safe production, the Shi Yuhai Group has established various strict inspection systems. The inspection system is one of the most important of their group's many systems. They have an inspection system within the working face. This system has two contents: one is mutual inspection of each type of work: the blaster inspects the drilling specifications, and does not load explosives and blast if the specifications are not met; the support worker inspects the working face and the top and bottom plates, and does not support the shed if the specifications are not met; the pneumatic drill operator inspects the loading worker, and does not trim the sides if the coal is not dug open. The other content is that the group leader and the group leaders of each type of work inspect the working face before the completion of the work and tell the shift leader about the situation. Another inspection system is called the sign-hanging system; the wood support and stone support must be inspected and accepted by the recorder, and then the nameplate of the corresponding support worker or filling worker is hung. The qualified wood support and stone support are stamped with a steel seal, and the unqualified ones are not stamped with a steel seal, but the words "unqualified" are written in chalk. With these two systems, each type of work in the group will be subject to different forms of inspection, so everyone can gradually consciously implement various regulations and systems. The shift handover system is also an important part of the Shi Yuhai Group's various systems. Through this system, the group leader can quickly grasp the situation of the entire working face at the beginning of the work, which is convenient for directing the work; the group leaders of each type of work can also quickly understand the operation of each group, check the tools, and start the operation.
    Why is the Shi Yuhai Group able to persistently create conditions and implement safe operations? This is not only because Shi Yuhai himself has a correct understanding of safe production, but more importantly, he is good at using various methods to promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conduct ideological education for the members of the group, thus giving full play to the collective strength and wisdom of the group. He has fought against various incorrect ideas. Many young miners often act solely on enthusiasm, and therefore treat safety issues with an adventurous attitude. In the past, Li Zhiyou, a young worker in the Shi Yuhai Group, was like this. He believed that whoever complied with the safety system was a "scaredy-cat," "not brave," and "not a hard bone," and said, "I go where there is danger, don't go down the pit if you are afraid of death!" In operation, these people often blindly break through and work recklessly, and are unwilling to abide by regulations and discipline. There are also some people among the miners, especially the old miners, who have deeply ingrained fatalistic views. Zhang Yushu of the Shi Yuhai Group is like this. He entrusts his life to the "blessing" of the Old Lord, worships the "Old Lord" at home, and often goes to the Old Lord Temple to burn incense. Even when the Shi Yuhai Group was selected as a model group for safe production, he said it was "blessed by the 'Old Lord'." There are also some workers who only know how to act according to their own narrow experience and do not understand the importance of complying with scientific safety regulations. Shi Yuhai once used various facts familiar to everyone, especially various bloody lessons, to educate everyone, analyze these facts, and let everyone understand that accidents can happen at any time, but they are not accidental; mastering its laws and using scientific operating methods can overcome it; at the same time, only by ensuring safety and gradually improving technology can we overfulfill the state's tasks. Those people have all been educated by him. Shi Yuhai never relaxes ideological education. There are three types of meetings in their group: one is a production meeting to study production technology issues; one is a meeting to review and revise the patriotic pact and discuss life and welfare issues; and the other is called a temporary meeting: this meeting is irregular. If an accident occurs elsewhere, or someone in the group violates regulations and discipline, a meeting will be held to conduct criticism and self-criticism, and earnestly discuss it to learn from it. Those who violate regulations and discipline must make a review at the meeting, which they call "taking a picture." At these meetings, everyone tries to express their opinions, so the various disciplines and systems in the group can be consolidated and implemented.
    The Shi Yuhai Group pays attention to improving operating technology at all times. They often study operating procedures with technicians and check the quality specifications of operations. Old workers teaching new workers operating technology has become a natural habit. They have explored some experience in drilling, blasting, filling, and support. Therefore, their various operation specifications are neat and the progress is rapid. For example, in terms of blasting, they stipulate that the coal dust in the blast hole must be completely removed to avoid increasing coal dust after blasting. At the same time, it is stipulated that the workers who load explosives should listen to the opinions of the drilling workers and increase or decrease the explosives according to the softness and hardness of the coal quality in order to fully exert the blasting effect.
    The result of the Shi Yuhai Group's correct and complete implementation of the safe production policy is that safety and production have become an inseparable whole. Therefore, eliminating serious injuries and fatalities and frequently overfulfilling tasks have become inevitable results. The achievements of the Shi Yuhai Group prove that although accidents can often occur in underground production, as long as we carefully analyze accidents, find out the laws, create tricks, and strictly implement safe and regular operations, accidents are not unavoidable, let alone opposed to production.

    施玉海小组是安全生产的旗帜
    陈真
    东北西安煤矿富国三坑施玉海小组是全国闻名的安全生产小组。从一九四七年六月解放到现在，已经快要五年了，施玉海小组从未发生过死亡或重伤事故，并且每年每季都超额完成了国家的生产任务。因此，几年以来，施玉海小组曾受奖十五次，成为煤矿工业中安全生产的旗帜。
    西安煤矿是超级瓦斯矿，煤质松脆，容易自燃。在这种客观情况下，施玉海小组为什么能够消灭死亡和重伤事故呢？这是因为施玉海小组积极地主动地向各种事故进行了不懈的斗争。施玉海把自己多年的操作经验和各种科学的技术规程结合起来，掌握了井下各种生产条件变化的规律，对各种事故有了科学的预见，因此，他能够认真执行保安规程，采取科学的正规作业方法和严密的管理制度，在每一工种的每一操作上，都努力创造条件，实行安全操作。
    施玉海小组根据自己掌子面的情况，从一切方面，努力预防各种主要事故。比如，为了防止瓦斯爆炸事故，施玉海小组严格执行瓦斯检查制度。观测员每天检查瓦斯含量后，都要把观测的结果写在柱子上，并标明日期；这样，一方面提高观测员的责任心，一方面使在井下工作的工人都能掌握瓦斯情况。每次放完一遍炮，还要检查一次瓦斯情况。他们一个班要放四次炮，一定要检查四遍瓦斯情况
    （别的小组一般只是检查一两次）。加上对通风工作的严格管理，施玉海小组已经能够基本上控制瓦斯，不使燃烧爆炸。冒顶片帮（即采煤场子上面或煤壁上的石头或煤块塌落）是井下最多的事故，施玉海小组十分注意顶板管理工作。每放完一遍炮后，工人一定要叫顶问帮（检查顶板和煤壁情况，如果发现某处有塌落的可能，随即进行处理），然后挑顶、刷帮、拉底（即去掉顶板、煤壁、底板上的浮煤），使巷道规格整齐，合乎正规作业标准，便于使用成品棚子。在砌石垛顶子时，他们一定要扫清浮煤，找出硬底。因为如果把石垛打在浮煤上，就不能有效地抗拒顶板压力，容易造成冒顶事故。按照保安规程规定，在坑木运搬没有机械化的坑井，一定要准备一定数量的坑木，才能开始采煤。因此，常常发生因坑木供应不上而不敢放炮或装煤的现象。施玉海所在掌子的煤质松脆，支柱工作更为重要。他们规定，下井时，每人都要扛一根坑木，这样就解决了支柱工作的困难。在充填方面，在采二层或三层煤时，挑顶一定挑透多下石头，使充填部分的石头密集以便有效地管理顶板，同时使风量集中在工作面上，冲淡瓦斯。在掌子面上常有煤尘飞扬，这样，既妨碍工人的健康，又容易引起煤尘爆炸。施玉海小组严格执行了洒水制度，在每次放炮前后，一定各洒水一次，以便压下煤尘，免得在放炮时发出火花，引起煤尘爆炸。同时，在坑道内设喷雾器，经常喷雾、喷水或粉，以防煤尘燃烧。施玉海小组的工作面上秩序井然。这样，一有发生事故的迹象，工人们立刻就可以觉察到。他们的工作面上的棚木、石垛都成一条直线，煤仓及下煤口道和水沟经常清理；放炮员放炮时一定要喊号；搬运坑木时一定要轻拿轻放，等等。施玉海小组对这些小的地方，从不马虎大意。他们懂得，在井下生产时，随时注意保安工作，事故是一定可以避免的；假如稍有疏忽，事故就随时可以发生。
    施玉海小组实行严格的分工专责制，但又能有机的合作。进入施玉海小组的工作面，就像是进入一个现代化的机器车间一样，各种作业规格整齐，工人们紧张协调地工作，真是有条不紊。工人们根据图表的指示，按照作业规程的要求，努力完成自己的任务。同样，他们完全懂得，在采煤工作中，任何一个工种落后了，都会影响整个工作的完成，甚至造成事故，因此，各工种之间能够进行必要的适当的交错互助。在交错互助过程中，他们又注意解决最薄弱而又是关键性的环节。在各工种进度尚不能完全一致的情况下，这种交错互助的方法，能使各工种之间紧密衔接，避免脱节窝工现象。
    为了贯彻安全生产的方针，施玉海小组建立了各种严格的检查制度。检查制度是他们小组的许多制度中最重要的一种。他们有掌子内的检查制度。这个制度有两个内容，一是各工种互相检查：放炮员检查打眼规格，不合规格不装药放炮；支柱工检查掌子面和顶板底板，不合规格不支棚子；风镐手检查装车工，煤不扒开不刷帮。另一个内容是组长及各工种组长在完工前检查掌子，并将情况告诉接班组长。另一种检查制度叫做挂牌制度；棚子和石垛要经纪录员验收，然后挂上各该支柱工或充填工的名牌。棚子和石垛合格的打钢印，不合格的不打钢印，而用粉笔写上“不合格”的字样。有了这两种制度，小组里各个工种都要受到不同形式的检查，因此，大家能够逐渐自觉地执行各种规程制度。交接班制度也是施玉海小组各项制度中重要的一项。通过这个制度，组长在工作开始时，就可以迅速掌握全工作面的情况，便于指挥工作；各工种组长也可以迅速了解各组作业情况，检查工具，开始操作。
    施玉海小组为什么能够坚持不懈地创造条件，实行安全作业呢？这不仅是因为施玉海本人对安全生产具有正确的认识，更重要的是他善于运用各种方式，发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，对小组中的成员进行思想教育，因而充分发挥了小组的集体力量和智慧。他曾经和各种不正确的思想进行过斗争。许多青年矿工常常单凭热情办事，因而用冒险主义的态度对待保安问题。过去，施玉海小组中的青年工人李志有就是这样。他认为谁遵守保安制度谁就是“怕死鬼”、“不勇敢”、“不是硬骨头”，说什么“那里有危险我去，怕死别下坑！”在操作中，这些人常常盲闯蛮干，不愿遵守规程、纪律。在矿工中还有一些人，特别是老矿工，有着根深蒂固的宿命观点。施玉海小组的张玉书就是这样。他把自己的生命交给老君爷“保佑”，家里供着“老君爷”，还常到老君庙去烧香。直到施玉海小组当选为安全生产模范组时，他还说是“‘老君爷’保佑的”。还有一些工人，只知道按照自己的狭隘经验办事，不懂得遵守科学的保安规程的重要。施玉海曾经用大家所熟悉的各种事实，特别是种种血的教训，向大家进行教育，分析这些事实，让大家懂得事故是随时可以发生的，但都不是偶然的；掌握了它的规律，运用科学的操作办法，就可以战胜它；同时只有保证了安全，逐步提高了技术，才能超额完成国家的任务。那些人，都被他教育过来了。施玉海始终不放松思想教育工作。他们组里有三种会议，一种是研究生产技术问题的生产会议；一种是检查修订爱国公约，讨论生活福利问题的会议；另一种叫做临时会议：这种会议不定时，别的地方发生了事故，或者小组里有人违犯了规程纪律，就开会进行批评和自我批评，认真加以讨论，从中吸取教训。违犯规程纪律的人在会上要做检讨，他们把这叫做“照像”。在这些会议上，每个人都尽量发表自己的意见，所以小组中的各种纪律、制度，能够巩固和贯彻。
    施玉海小组时时注意改进操作技术。他们时常和技术人员在一起研究操作规程，检查作业的质量规格。老工人教导新工人操作技术，成为一种自然的习惯。在打眼、放炮、充填、支柱方面，他们都摸索出一些经验。因此，他们的各种作业规格整齐，进度迅速。比如，在放炮方面，他们规定炮眼内煤末一定要掏尽，免得爆破后增加煤尘。同时规定，装炮药的工人要听取打眼工的意见，根据煤质软硬增减炮药，以便充分发挥爆破效能。
    施玉海小组这样正确地完整地实现安全生产方针的结果，安全和生产就成为一个不可分割的整体。因此，消灭重伤和死亡事故，经常超额完成任务，就成了必然的结果。施玉海小组的成就证明：在井下生产，虽然经常可能发生事故，但是，只要认真地分析事故，找出规律，创造窍门，严格地实行安全正规作业，事故并不是不可避免的，更不是和生产对立的。
