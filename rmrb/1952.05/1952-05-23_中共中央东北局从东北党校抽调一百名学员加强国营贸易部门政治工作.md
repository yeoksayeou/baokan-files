The CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau Transfers One Hundred Cadets from Northeast Party School to Strengthen Political Work in State-Owned Trade Departments

Xinhua News Agency: The CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau has transferred one hundred cadets from the Northeast Party School, who have been assigned by the Northeast People's Government to work in state-owned commercial departments, in order to strengthen the political work in state-owned trade departments. These cadres had previously worked in CPC county committees in various parts of Northeast China. They had undergone a relatively long period of practical struggle and had also received eight months of study at the Party School. Before being assigned to work in state-owned trade departments this time, they underwent a short period of professional training. Gao Gang, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Northeast Bureau, and other members of the Northeast Bureau, gave special reports to the training class, correcting the erroneous ideas held by some cadres who belittled commercial work and worried about the complexity of commercial work operations.

    中共中央东北局从东北党校抽调一百名学员加强国营贸易部门政治工作
    中共中央东北局从东北党校中抽调出一百名学员，由东北人民政府分配国营商业部门工作，以加强国营贸易部门的政治工作。这批干部，过去大都在东北各地中共县委会工作，他们都经过较长时期的实际斗争，又在党校进行了八个月的学习。在这次分配到国营贸易部门工作前，又经过了短期的专业训练，中共中央东北局书记高岗及东北局的各委员并分别到训练班去作了专题报告，纠正了某些干部轻视商业工作和顾虑商业工作业务复杂等错误思想。　　　　　（新华社）
