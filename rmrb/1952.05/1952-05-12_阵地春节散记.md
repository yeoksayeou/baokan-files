    Spring Festival Diary from the Front Lines
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Huashan
    From the division headquarters to the forward command post, the car had to pass through a section of artillery fire blockade, but it was much faster than walking, and I could make it to the company in time for the Spring Festival.
    After crossing the Imjin River, the car raced towards the front line where shells were bursting.
    It was already past 10 PM on New Year's Eve. The searchlights of Panmunjom and the enemy's positions were right in front of us. Artillery fire flashed, indistinguishable from the mountains or the clouds.
    According to the report before departure, the enemy's artillery fire on this defense line was particularly light today, only 270 rounds, with no casualties. But now it has suddenly intensified.
    The enemy doesn't want us to have a good Spring Festival!
    The car roared against the screaming and roaring of howitzer shells. There were no air raid sentries along the way. The car sped for ten minutes then killed the lights and engine to listen -- enemy planes always circled over at this time.
    As soon as the enemy planes passed overhead, we turned on the lights and moved forward. This was not a place to linger.
    Splintered branches, overturned new soil, stained black snow... The road became rugged.
    The car drove into an area frequently blockaded by artillery fire.
    Several soldiers stood at the entrance of a cave beside the road. Under the earthen cliff were parked several military handcarts, Northeast sleds, and Korean-style backpacks. These were the frontline transporters waiting to carry out their mission. It seemed that the road entrance would not be shelled for the time being. Intense artillery fire was flashing not far away, lighting up patches of red hills and thick clouds pressing down on the position against the dark sky.
    The car sped toward the artillery fire.
    Midnight. We stopped in front of a dilapidated thatched house. This was the agreed-upon place. A pungent smell of gunpowder.
    Two soldiers ran out from the darkness:
    "Hurry up! We were covered in dirt from the shelling just now."
    They were there to meet us at the road entrance. The car turned back the way it came. The soldiers led us forward quickly, constantly reminding us:
    "Disperse a bit; hurry a few steps; point the flashlight low..."
    Snow-covered shell craters. Slippery field paths. Tangled thorns hitting our boots. The flashlight illuminated a newly built stone breastwork at the foot of the mountain, with a wooden sign stuck on it:
    "217 Forward Command Post."
    We've arrived! Two shells landed in the ditch, but we had already turned past the breastwork and entered the brightly lit concealed headquarters.
    The operations room was lit by a gasoline lamp. A brazier of red-hot charcoal was on the floor of the side room. Candlelight reflected off the newly papered ceiling and walls. A marching bed was placed against the wall. There were a few small wooden stools in front of the radio -- we've made a home on the front lines!
    "It's a bit more luxurious here than the company's position, but not as impressive," the deputy division commander said simply, reciting to me a recently composed gun-barrel poem by the soldiers:
    "Heroes live in caves;
    Drive 'B-29s' (American heavy bombers) to their deaths,
    Scare American soldiers to death. -- You'll see it tomorrow when you go to the front. Comrades from the Beijing Film Studio arrived at the Second Company this morning to film the Spring Festival activities."
    Looking at the map, every hilltop was a position, interconnected by trenches and roads: for infantry, artillery, tanks, frontline logistics... the entire defense area seemed like a city.
    But when we walked out of the cave and climbed the hillside, all we saw were peaks and valleys, forests and snow -- the entire defense line was well concealed from the enemy's artillery fire.
    Clearly, gongs and drums were sounding on the hillside, but we couldn't see anyone or the road up the mountain.
    Fortunately, Comrade Peng, who was accompanying me for the interview, had just returned from the Second Company yesterday. He had been running back and forth on the forward position for two months and knew the roads well. He could find any company directly without going through the command system. He said: the shortcut is only seven or eight li, but we have to walk along a newly built tank road, and that ditch is often shelled, so running in a heavy coat is too cumbersome. I just put on a snow suit, took two candles, and followed him.
    Noon. The sky was very quiet. Scattered artillery fire was heard here and there. A so-called "Thunderbolt" jet fighter, nicknamed "Oil Carrier," showed itself high in the sky and then disappeared. Only the "old patient" reconnaissance plane kept circling along the front line, from dawn until now without stopping.
    When we came from Pyongyang, we rarely encountered enemy planes attacking the ground during the day. At that time, I thought: those once-crazy "Mustangs" and "Thunderbolts" had all been driven to the front. Now that the positions were face-to-face with the enemy, these aerial bandits were flying even higher than the reconnaissance planes. The airspace above our anti-aircraft artillery positions was like a dangerous peak, and the enemy planes either circled far away or bypassed us from the clouds. My camouflage snowsuit has been worn for nothing this winter. We walked six or seven li and didn't see anyone wearing camouflage netting.
    However, there were places being shelled along the way. Even the shady slopes of the mountain, facing away from the enemy, were scattered with black snow churned up by howitzer shells. This was a mountain pass frequently used by frontline transporters. Judging from the shell-pocked stream and hillside, there was no place on this section of road that hadn't been hit by shrapnel, although the mountain was so steep and the gully so deep that only flat-trajectory shells that happened to graze the ridge and slant down could hit the slope. Then, the front and back of the mountain must have been shelled even more. Strangely, even though so many people passed through here every night, there wasn't a single trace of blood on the snowy slopes. Suddenly, a trench appeared on the mountain ridge. As soon as I jumped down, I thought of a gun-barrel poem:
    "American soldiers,
    Fooling around,
    Shooting randomly without a target..."
    In this trench, winding along the mountain ridge, the sound of Yangko gongs and drums drifted up from the ground. Comrade Peng said: It doesn't matter now. We can walk all over several mountains without leaving the trench.
    What a vast project, chipped out with pickaxes! The breastwork was all hard soil and rock, so high that you couldn't reach the top. The steps went up and down with the terrain, longer than the stairs of a mansion. Before we had gone far, we came across a deep foxhole, branching off from the wall into the mountain. Along the way, Comrade Peng introduced:
    "This is a shell shelter, for passersby to take cover from shells at any time; this is a mobile ammunition depot, for use during combat; this is a toilet, shells dropped into the trench won't hit inside; this is a fortification left by the brotherly units. The Second Company lived here when they first arrived."
    A series of shells whistled low in the air. I couldn't help but exclaim.
    "It's really upstairs and downstairs!" I said, pointing to the row of bunkers along the edge of the trench. "These caves are enough for the enemy's artillery to chew on."
    "They'll 'break down' before they get chewed up. We've moved to the new caves in front."
    The trench began to descend the ridge. Ahead was a barren, scorched hillside with scattered trees.
    Uprooted trees, splintered and hanging branches, the roots of old trees spanning the trenches -- the enemy's "aerial fortresses" had bombed here for three whole days. Even under the thick snow, the marks of the entire ground being overturned by giant bombs were still visible. And right on this hilltop, plowed by several giant bombs, I saw a series of underground bedrooms, dining halls, libraries, clubs, tofu workshops, bean sprout beds, bathhouses, and blacksmith's forges.
    Every hilltop is a home...
    Before we even reached the Second Company's command post, the masters of each squad along the way insisted that we stay.
    "Comrade Peng, you're here again!" A cheerful young man greeted us under a pine branch arch. "Come inside and warm up."
    His face was flushed, and he was standing in the wind at the entrance of the cave, probably from being hot by the stove making dumplings. A burst of steaming water billowed from the doorframe of the earthen cave. "The dumplings are in the pot, eat with us! The company also has pork and cabbage filling."
    He was the squad leader of the Third Squad, and he joined the Battle of Unsan as soon as he left the country. Hearing that I was from Beijing, he was even happier:
    "From the motherland! You must have had a hard trip."
    "You're the ones who have it hard! The enemy has been held back, the roads have been repaired, and you've made a home on the position; everywhere I went, it was like home. If you hadn't fought so well, the enemy would have let me come here to wish you a Happy New Year!"
    "It's all thanks to the support of the people of the motherland; they even sent us festive gongs and drums. ...Walk slowly, there's a step down. -- Bring a light out here!"
    I lit the candle and followed the passageway inside.
    Two flaming stoves, like fireplaces, blocked the cold air from outside the cave. One pot was made from an American artillery shell box, the other was a tin box sent from the motherland for holding biscuits. The squad leader pointed to the furniture against the wall and said: "The motherland is really thoughtful. The biscuits are packed in big tin boxes, so they're not afraid of moisture or breaking. We've eaten several boxes, and now we have vegetable bowls, rice bowls, and washbasins. The box lids can even be made into iron spoons, soup spoons, lamp bowls, and ashtrays -- we have a whole set of household items as soon as we put our hands to it."
    Deep in the passageway, neat grass beds, like foxholes, were arranged on both sides: tarpaulins were supported above them, tarpaulins were spread on the beds, straw curtains surrounded the walls, and neatly arranged rifles and knapsacks hung on the walls. "What beautiful beds!" I couldn't help but exclaim. "They're like soft sleeper cars. It would be great to sit face-to-face and have an entertainment evening!"
    "That's where we hold our squad meetings," said the squad leader. "We have to hold variety shows inside: it can seat a row of people."
    The oil lamp reflected a group of soldiers playing gongs and drums. It was the "crossroads" of three squads. On the "sleeper" near the road entrance, some were playing chess, some were playing cards, and the kang table was made of neatly folded cotton coats. Some were playing bamboo clappers, pulling on a fiddle made of tin cans and horsehair.
    We squeezed through the joyous crowd, and the bright red waist drums showed two lines of writing in front of the candles:
    "Victory Flower Drum -- Presented by the Lanzhou Women's Federation and the Youth League."
    The enthusiastic hosts led us to the end of the sleeper and brought us a steaming box of dumplings. As a salvo of artillery fire pounded the hilltop, the soldiers kept saying:
    "Eat, it's okay here, sand and dust won't fall into your bowl." (To be continued)

    阵地春节散记
    新华社记者  华山
    从师部到前线指挥所，坐汽车要多过一段炮火封锁线，可是比步行快的多，满可以赶到连队过春节。
    过了临津江，车就朝着弹光迸裂的火线奔驰起来。
    已经是除夕晚上十点多钟。板门店和敌军阵地上的探照灯光就在眼前。炮火闪闪，分不出是在山丛中还是在云缝里。
    出发前的报告，今天敌人打到这条防线的炮火特别少，只二百七十发，没有伤亡。现在却突然猛烈起来了。
    敌人想不让我们好好过春节哩！
    汽车迎着嘶裂震吼的榴弹炮声吼动着。沿途没有防空哨了。汽车猛跑十来分钟就灭灯、熄火听听，——敌机总在这时盘旋过来。
    敌机越过头顶，立刻亮灯前进。这里不是逗留的地方。
    劈裂的树枝，掀翻的新土，污黑的积雪……道路崎岖起来。
    汽车开进了炮火经常封锁的地带。
    路口旁边的洞口站着几个战士，土崖下停放着几架军用手车，东北爬犁，和朝鲜式的背架。这是等着执行任务的火线运输员。看样子，这阵子路口是不会落炮的，不远处正闪着密集的炮火，漆黑的天边亮出一处处的红色山岗和压着阵地的浓云。
    汽车朝着炮声驰去。
    午夜。我们停在一间破草房跟前。这是约定的地方。一阵刺鼻的火药味。
    黑暗中跑出两个战士来：
    “赶快走！刚刚打过炮，掀我们一身土。”
    他们是到路口接我们的。汽车顺着来路转回去了。战士领着我们往前紧走，不住地关照着：
    “疏散点；紧走几步；手电棒往低处打……”
    积雪的弹坑。溜滑的田径。乱荆条打着靴子。手电棒在山根下照出一道新垒的石头胸墙，上面插着一块木牌：
    “二一七前指。”
    到了！两发炮弹掀到沟里，我们已经转过胸墙，走进了灯火辉煌的隐蔽部。
    作战室亮着汽灯。侧房的地上放着一盆通红的木炭火。烛光映着裱糊一新的顶棚和墙壁，靠墙摆着一张行军床。收音机跟前是几张小木凳，——火线上也安家了！
    “这里比连队的阵地阔气些，可没那里气派大。”副师长简单介绍着，给我念了战士们新近创作的一段枪杆诗：
    “英雄住洞中；
    气死‘B二九’（美国重型轰炸机），
    吓死美国兵。——你明天到前面就能看到了。北京电影制片厂的同志早上刚到二连去拍春节活动。”
    从地图看，每个山头都是阵地，都有交通壕和道路交织连贯着：步兵的，炮兵的，战车的，火线后勤的，……整个防区好像一座城市。
    及至走出洞口，爬上山坡，只见到处都是峰峦沟壑，到处都是山林和积雪，——整条防线在敌人的炮火下隐蔽得好好的。
    分明半坡上响着锣鼓，却看不到人也看不见上山的路。
    好在和我一路采访的彭干事，昨天刚从二连回来。他在前沿阵地来回跑了两个月，路很熟，不用经过指挥系统就能直接找到各个连队。他说：抄近路只有七八里，不过要走一段新修的战车路，那条沟经常挨炮，穿大衣跑步太罗嗦。我只穿件雪衣，带上两根洋腊就跟他走了。
    中午。天空很安静。零落的炮声前后散布着。外号“挑油担”的所谓“雷电式”喷气冲击机在高空露了一下又不见了。只有“老病号”侦察机一劲儿顺着战线盘旋，从黎明到现在还没断过。
    从平壤来的时候，一路上白天很少碰到敌机冲击地面，当时以为：那些疯狂一时的“野马式”“雷电式”都叫撵到前面来了。现在阵地就和敌人脸对着脸地摆着，这些空中强盗反而比侦察机飞的更高。我们的高射炮阵地上空就像一座危险的高峰那样，敌机不是远远绕开就是从云里超越过去。我的伪装雪衣这一冬算是白带了，走了六七里路还没碰到谁个披着防空布。
    倒是一路上都有挨炮的地方，那怕是背着敌人的阴山坡也散布着榴弹炮掀开的黑雪。这是火线运输员经常来往的山隘口。从弹坑垒垒的溪涧和山坡看来，这段路没叫弹片打到过的地方是没有的，虽然山势这样陡，山沟这样深，平射的炮弹只有刚巧贴着山脊斜插下来才能打到坡上。那末，山前山后挨的炮就更加多的多了。奇怪的是，每晚有这许多人经过这里，雪坡上竟然看不到一点血迹。山棱上突然现出一道交通沟，我一跳下去就想起一首枪杆诗来：
    “美国兵，
    瞎胡闹，
    没有目标乱打炮。……”
    就在这条顺着山脊蜿蜒的交通沟里，地皮透出来一阵阵的秧歌锣鼓声。彭干事说：现在不要紧了，不出沟就能走遍好几道山了。
    一镐镐啃开的浩大工程，这是怎么挖出来的！胸墙尽是硬土和岩石，伸手摸不到顶，阶梯在脚下顺着山势上下，比大厦的楼梯还长，走不多远就碰到一个深深的狐洞，从墙根拐进山里。一路上彭干事介绍着说：
    “这是防炮洞，给过往人员随时躲炮的；这是机动弹药库，准备战斗中用的；这是厕所，炮弹掉到沟里也打不着里面；这是兄弟部队留下的工事，二连刚来的时候就住在这里。”
    低空响起一连串的炮弹呼啸。我忍不住赞叹起来。
    “真是楼上楼下哩！”我对着沟沿的一溜地堡说，“这些洞子，够敌人的炮火啃的。”
    “还没叫啃掉就‘报废’了。都住到前面的新洞子去了。”
    交通沟开始溜下山脊。前面是一片树木零乱焦黑的山岗。
    连根拔起的大树，劈裂倒挂的枝丫，架在壕沟上的老树的根条，——敌人的“空中堡垒”在这里轰炸了整整三天，埋在厚雪底下的山头还看得出地皮整个翻转的痕迹。就在巨型炸弹犁过几遍的山头上，我看到了一系列的地下卧房，食堂，图书馆，俱乐部，豆腐房，豆芽床，澡堂和铁匠炉。
    每个山头都是家……
    还没走到二连指挥所，沿途各班的主人就缠住不放了。
    “彭干事，你又来啦！”松枝彩门下迎出来一个愉快的小伙子，“快到里面暖和暖和。”
    他满脸红光，正在洞口风凉，大概是在火炉边包饺子热的。土洞的门框里滚出一阵阵开锅的水气。“饺子下锅啦，就在我们这里吃吧！连部也是一样的猪肉白菜馅子。”
    他是三班长，一出国就参加上云山战役。听说我是北京来的，更乐了：
    “从祖国来的！路上辛苦啦。”
    “你们才辛苦呢！敌人也打住了，公路也修好了，阵地上也安家了；一路上我走到那里都是家。要不是你们打得好，敌人让我到这里给你们拜年啦！”
    “这都是祖国人民支援的好；过节的锣鼓也送来了。……慢慢走，下坎啦，——里面快拿个灯出来！”
    我点起洋腊，照着过道往里走。
    两个火光熊熊的灶头，壁炉似的，堵住洞外的冷气，一口锅是美国炮弹箱，另一口是祖国送来的装饼干的宾铁箱。三班长指着贴墙的家具说：“祖国真想的周全，饼干装在大宾铁箱里，不怕潮，碰不碎，咱们吃了几箱，菜盆，饭盆，洗脸盆都有了，箱盖还能打成铁勺，羹匙，灯碗，烟灰盒，——一动手就有了整套家务了。”
    过道深处，两侧排列着狐洞式的齐崭的草铺：顶上撑着雨布，床上铺着雨布，草帘贴墙围着，挂着整齐的枪枝和挂包。“好漂亮的床！”我忍不住叫起来，“赶上软席卧车了。脸对脸坐着开个娱乐晚会多带劲！”
    “我们的班务会就是在这里开的。”三班长说，“开晚会得到里面：那里能坐一排人。”
    油灯映出一群敲锣打鼓的战士。那是三个班的
    “十字路口”，靠近路口的“卧铺”上有人在下象棋，打扑克，炕桌是叠得方方整整的棉大衣。有的响着竹板，拉着罐头盒子和马尾做成的胡琴。
    我们从欢乐的人群中挤过去，鲜红的腰鼓在洋蜡跟前显出两行字迹：
    “胜利花鼓——兰州市妇联会，青年团敬赠。”
    热情的主人们把我们让到卧铺尽里头，端上热腾腾的一箱饺子。一顿炮火抡到山头上，战士们只管让着说：
    “吃吧，我们这里不要紧，砂尘也掉不到碗里来。”  （未完）
