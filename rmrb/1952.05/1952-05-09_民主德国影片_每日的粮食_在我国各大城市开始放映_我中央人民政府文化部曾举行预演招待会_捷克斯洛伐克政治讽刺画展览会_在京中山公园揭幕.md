Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: The first film from the German Democratic Republic dubbed into Mandarin Chinese, "Daily Bread," will begin screening in major cities across China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Wuhan, starting on May 8th—the anniversary of Germany's liberation. The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government held a special preview reception at the Capital Cinema on the 7th. Attendees included figures from Beijing's literary, artistic, and film circles, as well as representatives from various government departments, organizations, workers, students, youth, and women, totaling over 1,000 people. Kurt König, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China with the rank of Ambassador, and other members of the mission also attended the reception. Also invited were diplomatic envoys from Romania, Mongolia, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Poland.

The reception was presided over by Zhou Yang, Vice Minister of Culture. In his speech, he pointed out the special significance of screening this film on the anniversary of Germany's liberation. He said: This film shows us the struggle of the people of Democratic Germany, under the leadership of the working class, to overcome material difficulties and capitalist ideology in the difficult years after the war. Zhou Yang pointed out: Today, the struggle for German unification and against the rearmament of West Germany by American imperialism is completely united with the struggle of the Chinese people against American imperialist war of aggression and bacteriological warfare. He concluded by wishing for the further consolidation and strengthening of friendship and cultural exchange between China and Germany.

Kurt König, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic to China, also spoke. He said: The new Chinese films "Daughters of China" and "Steel Fighter" have been dubbed into German and screened in Democratic Germany. The heroic deeds of the Chinese people introduced in these films have given the German people strength and confidence in victory in their struggle against national enemies and for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. He hoped that the film "Daily Bread" would become an outstanding messenger of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and German people.
