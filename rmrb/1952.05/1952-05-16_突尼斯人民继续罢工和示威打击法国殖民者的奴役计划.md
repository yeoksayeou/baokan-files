Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Tunis dispatch: May 12th marked the 71st anniversary of the forced signing of the protectorate treaty by French colonialists in Tunisia. The heroic Tunisian people transformed this day of humiliation into a day of struggle for national liberation. On this day, under the slogan "Tunisia belongs to Tunisians," demonstrations and strikes were held in many parts of the country. Merchants in the Arab quarter of the capital, Tunis, and Sfax went on strike. The night before, the people of Tunis gathered in front of the Prime Minister's residence of the French puppet Bakush to demonstrate. Although the colonial authorities dispatched a large number of military police who attacked the demonstrators with machine guns and submachine guns, resulting in bloodshed, the Tunisian people were not intimidated by this barbaric massacre. Thirty minutes later, the people reorganized their ranks, shouted slogans demanding national independence and overthrowing the French puppet Bakush, and continued their demonstrations. Throughout Tunisia, patriotic people held demonstrations despite martial law and the suppression by armed military police.

Since the Bakush puppet government came to power on April 12, the Tunisian people's national independence movement has continued to develop. On April 16, the working people of Tunisia held a large demonstration against the Bakush puppet government; subsequently, students in Matel, Ras Jebel, and other places also went on strike. On April 20, the Tunisian people demonstrated in front of the Prime Minister's residence. On April 22, students from the Sfax College of Arts and Sciences held a march and demonstration. On April 26, students in Tunis and Sousse held rallies and demonstrations to protest persecution, oppose the Bakush puppet government, and demand national independence. On April 28, dockworkers in various ports of Tunisia went on strike to protest the French colonial authorities' ban on holding a "May Day" demonstration; citizens of Tunis and students in Kairouan, Mornaguia, and other places also held demonstrations. In addition, leaders of many nationalist parties in Tunisia and France's other two colonies in North Africa, Algeria and Morocco, jointly sent a telegram to the United Nations in late April, protesting that the Security Council "subordinated itself to the direct political and strategic interests of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, disregarding the legitimate rights of the Tunisian people," and refused to include the Tunisian issue on the agenda on April 14.

The heroic struggle of the Tunisian people has severely undermined the French colonialists' enslavement plan. After coercing the King of Tunisia into submission by high-handed means in late March, the French colonialists, in order to divide the Tunisian national independence movement, proposed a deceptive "reform plan" to organize a so-called "French-Tunisian Joint Constitutional Reform Committee." However, until now, this puppet organization, which was originally scheduled to hold its first meeting on April 24, has still been unable to be formed. Reuters admitted: "Tunisian Prime Minister Bakush has been unable to persuade any influential Tunisians to agree to participate in this committee."

     突尼斯人民继续罢工和示威打击法国殖民者的奴役计划
    【新华社十五日讯】突尼斯消息：五月十二日是法国殖民者强迫突尼斯签订保护国条约的七十一周年纪念日。英勇的突尼斯人民把这个屈辱的日子变成了争取民族解放的斗争日。这一天，在“突尼斯属于突尼斯人”的口号下，全国许多地方都举行了示威游行和罢工，首都突尼斯市阿拉伯区和斯法克斯的商人，都举行了罢市。在前一天晚上，突尼斯市的人民齐集在法国傀儡巴库士的首相府前示威。尽管殖民当局调来大批军警，用机关枪和冲锋枪向示威者进攻，以致酿成血案，但是，突尼斯人民并没有被这种野蛮的屠杀吓倒。三十分钟以后，人们又重新整顿好队伍，高呼要求民族独立、打倒法国傀儡巴库士的口号，继续举行示威。在突尼斯全国各地，爱国人民也不顾戒严和武装军警的镇压，举行了示威。
    自从巴库士傀儡政府在四月十二日登台以来，突尼斯人民的民族独立运动继续不断地发展。四月十六日，突尼斯劳动人民举行大示威，反对巴库士傀儡政府；随后，马特尔、拉谢巴等地的学生们也举行了罢课。四月二十日，突尼斯人民在首相府前示威。四月二十二日，斯法克斯文学院的学生举行了游行示威。四月二十六日，突尼斯市和苏斯的学生又举行集会和示威，抗议迫害，反对巴库士傀儡政府，要求民族独立。四月二十八日，突尼斯各港口的码头工人举行罢工，抗议法国殖民当局禁止举行“五一”节大示威；突尼斯市市民和开洛恩、摩尼克纳等地的学生，也举行了示威。此外，突尼斯和法国在北非另外两个殖民地阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥等国的许多民族主义政党的领袖们，也在四月下旬联名致电联合国，抗议安全理事会“服从北大西洋联盟国家在政治上和战略上的直接利益，不顾突尼斯人的合法权利”，而于四月十四日拒绝把突尼斯问题列入议程。
    突尼斯人民的英勇斗争沉重地打击了法国殖民者的奴役计划。法国殖民者在三月下旬以高压手段胁迫突尼斯国王屈服后，为了分化突尼斯的民族独立运动，曾经提出一个欺骗性的“革新计划”，要组织所谓“法国、突尼斯联合宪政改革委员会”。但是，直到现在，这个原订在四月二十四日举行第一次会议的傀儡组织还仍然无法组成。路透社承认：“突尼斯首相巴库士一直无法使任何有势力的突尼斯人答应参加这个委员会。”
