Brief Commentary on Economic Life

Strengthening safety education is key to learning from the safety production experience of the Shi Yuhai Group

Last year, miners in the Northeast and other regions widely launched the Shi Yuhai Group's safety production movement, achieving significant results in eliminating and reducing casualties. In the Northeast coal mines, 455 Shi Yuhai-style groups have emerged, and the miner mortality rate has decreased by more than 58% compared to 1950. The loss of national wealth has been greatly reduced, and workers' awareness of safety issues has also greatly improved. However, since the beginning of this year, the number of accidents in coal mines in various regions has increased compared to the same period last year. In the upcoming large-scale production increase and conservation campaign, further learning from the Shi Yuhai Group's experience and resolutely implementing the safety production policy has become an important task for coal mines in various regions.

The Shi Yuhai Group has scientific systems and strict discipline, which ensures that they can carry out production under safe conditions. All kinds of systems and disciplines need to be implemented by conscious people. The reason why the Shi Yuhai Group's various systems, disciplines, and operating methods can guarantee the implementation of the safety production policy is mainly because, under Shi Yuhai's patient education, all workers in the group have a correct understanding of safety production and a scientific analysis of accidents. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate various accidents. If the workers of the Shi Yuhai Group still believe that safety depends on the "Old Lord" for protection, that "implementing safety regulations is for cowards," or blindly stick to their own old experiences, then even if the Shi Yuhai Group formulates more, more perfect, and more scientific disciplines, systems, and operating methods, it will be impossible to prevent accidents!

At present, the understanding of safety issues among mine workers has greatly changed compared to before liberation. However, because safety education has not been conducted deeply and regularly enough, workers' incorrect understanding of safety issues has not been completely corrected. This is the biggest obstacle to learning from the Shi Yuhai Group's safety production experience and should be resolved first. Leading cadres of various mines must first correct their own understanding of safety production, conduct in-depth safety education for workers, and enable workers to truly understand the important significance of safety regulations and consciously abide by them. Only in this way can the vast majority of workers absorb the experience of the Shi Yuhai Group, and based on their specific circumstances, create conditions, come up with tricks, and conscientiously implement safe and standardized operations.

    加强安全教育是学习施玉海小组安全生产经验的关键
    去年，东北和其他各地的矿工，普遍地开展了施玉海小组安全生产运动，在消灭和减少伤亡事故方面，收到了很大的效果。在东北各煤矿中，已经出现了四百五十五个施玉海式小组，矿工死亡率较一九五零年降低了百分之五十八以上。国家财富的损失大大减少，职工对安全问题的认识也大有进步。但是，今年以来，各地煤矿的事故比较去年同时期又有增加。在即将开始的大规模的增产节约运动中，进一步学习施玉海小组的经验，坚决贯彻安全生产的方针，已经成为各地煤矿的重要任务。
    施玉海小组有科学的制度和严格的纪律，这就保证了他们能够在安全的条件下进行生产。各种制度和纪律，都是要由觉悟了的人来执行的。施玉海小组的各种制度、纪律以及操作方法，所以能够成为贯彻安全生产方针的保证，主要的就是因为在施玉海的耐心教育下，全组工人对安全生产有了正确的认识，对事故做了科学的分析，因此，就有可能来消灭各种事故。假使施玉海小组的工人仍然认为安全得靠“老君爷”保佑，“执行保安规程就是怕死鬼”，或者是盲目地死守着自己的一点老经验办事，那么，即使施玉海小组订出更多的更完善更科学的纪律、制度和操作方法，也是无法防止事故的！
    目前，矿山工人对于安全问题的认识，比起解放以前已有很大的改变。但是，由于安全教育进行得还不够深入和经常，工人群众对于安全问题的不正确的认识还没有完全得到纠正。这是学习施玉海安全生产经验的最大的障碍，是应该首先加以解决的问题。各个矿山的领导干部必须首先端正自己对安全生产的认识，对工人进行深入的安全教育，使工人真正领会保安规程的重要意义而自觉地加以遵守。只有这样，广大工人才能吸取施玉海小组的经验，并根据自己的具体情况，创造条件，想出窍门，认真地实行安全正规作业。
