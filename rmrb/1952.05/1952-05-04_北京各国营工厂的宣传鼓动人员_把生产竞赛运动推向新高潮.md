    Propaganda Mobilization Personnel in State-Owned Factories in Beijing
    Push Production Emulation Campaign to New Heights
    Comrade Editor: Under the slogan of increasing production and commemorating "May Day," the workshop propaganda mobilization workers in our state-owned factories in Beijing have pushed the production emulation campaign to a new high.
    After the No. 3 Machine Factory received the task of manufacturing waterwheels, the propaganda mobilization workers widely used production bulletins, radio broadcasts, cartoons, and clapper talks for publicity. The news that worker Wu Qingxiu had found production tips was quickly spread among the workers in the entire factory, powerfully inspiring the workers' production enthusiasm. The workers of the No. 3 Factory found thirteen kinds of tips in just over ten days, greatly improving work efficiency.
    The workers in the repair workshop of the Liulihe Cement Plant put forward the mobilization slogan "One more rotation of the machine is equal to defeating one more enemy." They revised the patriotic convention, which included "Tiger Beating," "Production," "Safety," "Hygiene," and "Learning." The output of cement and clinker in this factory increased day by day, and accidents gradually decreased.
    The "Lightning Report" of the Changxindian Railway Factory greatly inspired the workers' production enthusiasm. The propaganda officers of each team promptly explained the contents of the "Lightning Report," and each team conducted discussions. Now more than two hundred trade union groups have formulated specific conditions for improving production. The workers said excitedly: "We must use the actual results of overfulfilling the production tasks as a gift to meet Chairman Mao in Tiananmen Square this year." All the teams in the freight yard, in order to celebrate "May Day" and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, guaranteed to increase production of one "Resist America, Aid Korea" locomotive in April. Many workers used their brains to find tips. The rationalization proposal committee received seven rationalization proposals in two days.

    北京各国营工厂的宣传鼓动人员
    把生产竞赛运动推向新高潮
    编辑同志：在增加生产、纪念“五一”的口号下，我们北京市各国营工厂的车间宣传鼓动工作者，把生产竞赛运动推向新的高潮。
    机器三分厂接到制造水车任务后，宣传鼓动工作者就广泛运用生产快报、广播、漫画、快板等进行宣传。工人吴清秀找出生产窍门的消息，很快地被传到全厂工人中间，有力地鼓舞了工人的生产热情。三分厂工人在十几天内找到十三种窍门，使工作效率大大提高。
    琉璃河水泥厂修理车间的工人提出“机器多转一周，就等于多打一个敌人”的鼓动口号，他们修订了爱国公约，内容包括“打虎”、“生产”、“安全”、“卫生”、“学习”等方面。这个厂水泥、熟料产额逐日增加，事故逐渐减少。
    长辛店铁路工厂的“闪电报”，大大地鼓舞了工人的生产热情，各小组的宣传干事及时地讲解了“闪电报”的内容，各组并进行了讨论。现在二百多个工会小组已订出了提高生产的具体条件。工人们都兴奋地说：“一定要以超额完成生产任务的实际成绩，作为今年在天安门前会见毛主席的礼物。”货车场所有的小组为庆祝“五一”，支援人民志愿军，保证在四月份要增产一辆“抗美援朝”号。许多工人开动脑筋找窍门。两天内合理化建议委员会就收到了七件合理化建议。  彭静
