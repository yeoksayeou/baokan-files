Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 28th: At the meeting of the Korean armistice negotiation delegation on the 28th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, sternly pointed out that the U.S. side has committed a series of massacre atrocities against our captured personnel, has not yet provided a responsible account for any of them, and has implemented a news blackout in an attempt to cover up its criminal acts. In order to force our captured personnel to accept their forced screening, the U.S. side cut off food supplies to more than 8,000 of our wounded and sick prisoners for as long as nine days. Furthermore, in order to implement its attempt to forcibly detain our captured personnel, it has mobilized the troops of its puppet countries to create various excuses and openly prepare for further persecution and massacres of our captured personnel. General Nam Il issued a serious warning that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers absolutely cannot sit idly by while their captured comrades are subjected to arbitrary massacres by the U.S. side. Every unit participating in the massacre of our captured personnel must bear the serious consequences of its actions.

General Nam Il's main speech was as follows:

	The blood debts you owe to our captured personnel cannot be denied. Over the past four months, you have carried out a series of atrocities and massacres in order to forcibly detain our captured personnel. You have an inescapable obligation to provide a responsible account to our side, but you have not yet provided any account. In the great massacre of February 18th, you killed and wounded more than 200 of our captured personnel. You cannot use any excuse to evade your responsibility for this bloody massacre, but you have not yet provided an account; in the great massacre of March 13th, you killed and wounded more than 30 of our captured personnel. You promised more than two months ago to conduct a detailed investigation into this massacre, but you have not yet provided any account; in the great massacre of April 10th, you killed and wounded more than 60 of our captured personnel. Not only did you fail to immediately notify our side of this serious incident, but you also implemented a news blackout for as long as 44 days; in the great massacre of May 20th, you killed and wounded more than 80 of our captured personnel. Our side lodged a serious protest, but you ignored it. Since you concealed the major bloody case of killing and wounding more than 60 of our captured personnel for more than 40 days, there must be more massacre incidents that are still being concealed by you and have not been made public. Now I want to question you, why did you conceal such a major case? In order to forcibly detain our captured personnel, how many massacres have you carried out? How many of our captured personnel have you killed and wounded? What are their injuries? What are the names of the dead? In the process of your persecution of our captured personnel, which ultimately evolved into the great massacre of May 20th, you inhumanely cut off food supplies to 8,000 of our wounded and sick prisoners for as long as nine days. On what principles did you use the method of stopping food supplies to forcibly compel our 8,000 wounded and sick personnel to accept your forced screening? In order to implement your attempt to forcibly detain our captured personnel, you are mobilizing more units of troops, creating various excuses, and preparing to carry out further persecution and massacres of our captured personnel. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely demand that you account for all incidents of massacring our captured personnel. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely support the just demands of our captured personnel and absolutely cannot sit idly by while their captured comrades are subjected to arbitrary massacres by your side. Every unit participating in the massacre of our captured personnel must bear the serious consequences of its actions. For the sake of the armistice in Korea, you must withdraw your heinous proposition of detaining our captured personnel and immediately cease all heinous acts of threatening, abusing, torturing, and massacring our captured personnel.

    南日将军严重警告美方
    我军不能坐视美方屠杀被俘战友
    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军严词指出美方对我被俘人员的一系列的屠杀暴行，至今没有对任何一件作负责的交代，且实行新闻封锁，企图一手掩盖其罪恶行为。美方为了强使我被俘人员接受其强迫甄别，曾对八千余名我方伤病俘断绝伙食达九天之久，而为了贯彻其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的企图，更调集其仆从国家的部队制造各种藉口，公开准备对我被俘人员进行进一步的迫害与屠杀。南日将军提出严重警告，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军绝对不能坐视他们被俘的战友遭受美方恣意屠杀。每一个参加屠杀我方被俘人员的部队，必须担负其行动所产生的严重后果。
    南日将军主要发言如下：
    你方对我方被俘人员欠下的血债是不能抵赖的。四个月来为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员，你方进行了一系列的暴行与屠杀。你方负有不可逃避的义务对我方作负责的交代，而你们至今未作任何交代。在二月十八日的大屠杀中，你方杀伤我方被俘人员二百余名，你方不能用任何藉口推卸你方对此次血腥屠杀的责任，但你们至今未作交代；在三月十三日的大屠杀中，你方杀伤我方被俘人员三十余名，对此次屠杀事件你们曾在两个多月前答应进行详细的调查，但至今未作任何交代；在四月十日的大屠杀中，你们杀伤我方被俘人员六十余名，你们不仅没有立刻将此次严重事件通知我方，并且实行新闻封锁达四十四天之久；在五月二十日的大屠杀中，你们杀伤我方被俘人员八十余名，我方提出了严重抗议，但你方竟悍然置之不理。你们既然隐瞒了杀伤我方被俘人员六十余名的重大血腥案件达四十余天之久，必然还有更多的屠杀事件，至今还在你方的隐瞒之中而没公开出来。现在我要质问你们，你们为什么要隐瞒这样的重大案件？为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员，你们究竟进行了多少次的屠杀？你们究竟杀伤了多少我方被俘人员？受伤的情况怎么样？死了的人的名字叫什么？在最后演变为五月二十日的大屠杀的你方迫害我方被俘人员的过程中，你方竟伤天害理地对八千名我方伤病俘断绝伙食达九天之久。你们究竟根据什么原则用停止伙食的办法来强使我方八千伤病人员接受你方的强迫甄别？为了贯彻你方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的企图，你方正在调集更多单位的部队，制造各种藉口，准备对我方被俘人员进行进一步的迫害与屠杀。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决要求你方交代一切屠杀我方被俘人员的事件。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决支持我方被俘人员的正义要求，绝对不能坐视他们被俘的战友遭受你方恣意屠杀。每一个参加屠杀我方被俘人员的部队，必须担负他的行动所产生的严重后果。为了朝鲜的停战，你方必须撤回扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶主张并立即停止对我方被俘人员的一切威胁、虐待、酷刑和屠杀的罪恶行为。
