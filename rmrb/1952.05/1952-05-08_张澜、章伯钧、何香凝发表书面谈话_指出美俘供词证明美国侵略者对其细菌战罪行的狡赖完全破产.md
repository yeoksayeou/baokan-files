Zhang Lan, Zhang Bojun, and He Xiangning Issue Written Statements
    Pointing Out that Confessions of American Prisoners Prove that the American Aggressors' Denials of Their Germ Warfare Crimes Have Completely Failed

    The confessions of American air force prisoners of war Enock and Quinn have once again exposed the inside story of the American aggressors' germ warfare. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, issued written statements to condemn the American aggressors' shameless behavior in denying germ warfare. Zhang Lan said: The towering crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in our country and Korea have long been confirmed by the "Investigation Team on Crimes of American Imperialism in Germ Warfare" organized by the people of our country and the investigation team dispatched by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, through on-the-spot investigations in the front and rear of Korea and in the Northeast region of our country, which obtained a large amount of evidence. The confessions of the two American air force prisoners of war, Enock and Quinn, who were enslaved, trained, and sent to Korea to drop germ bombs by Wall Street, as published in the May 6th newspaper, even more fully prove that American imperialism is a murderer who uses bacteriological weapons. The confessions exposed that the American aggressors' evil plan to launch germ warfare was carried out in extreme secrecy and after a long period of preparation. The evidence is conclusive, and the despicable and shameless American aggressors cannot use any tricks to quibble and deny it.
    Zhang Bojun said: When the American aggressors launched germ warfare, we proved, based on the many evil deeds committed by the American aggressors, that the germ warfare they launched had been premeditated for a long time. At the same time, we asserted that the American aggressors' use of inhumane bacteriological weapons precisely exposed the aggressors' decline and despair. Now, from the confessions of two American air force prisoners of war, Enock and Quinn, who personally dropped germ bombs, we further prove that our assertion is correct.
    The American aggressors are still shamelessly trying to deny their crimes of germ warfare in China and Korea in every possible way, and have instructed the Austrian reactionary government to prohibit Professor Brandweiner from reporting the evil facts of the American aggressors' germ warfare in China and Korea. The American aggressors' despicable and shameless means cannot cover up the ironclad bloody facts. The confessions of American air force prisoners of war Enock and Quinn not only give Wall Street tycoons a merciless answer, but also provide a very complete supplement to the truth and process of the American aggressors launching inhumane germ warfare.
    The towering crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in China and Korea have long been irrefutably proven. In the face of ironclad facts, denial is always just denial. The People's Daily editorial on May 6th said: "The day of judging the crimes of American germ warfare is approaching." Indeed, the peace-loving people of the world have unanimously declared that they will impose severe sanctions on the aggressors, and that day is not far away!
    He Xiangning said: The crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China have long been irrefutably proven, arousing the public outrage of the peace-loving people all over the world. Recently, two American airmen, Enock and Quinn, captured by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote confessions again, once again providing evidence of the American aggressors' germ warfare. At this point, those crazy beasts, the American aggressors, can no longer deny their towering crimes.
    In my life, I am reluctant to easily call people beasts. But for those inhumane American aggressors, I really can't find a more appropriate adjective than "crazy beasts." They risk the world's condemnation, conduct large-scale germ warfare, not only want to torture and kill Chinese and Korean soldiers, but also attempt to torture and kill Chinese and Korean women and children. This is more ferocious than any beast, and no beast is as vicious as they are, and no beast is as despicable as they are!
    Overseas Chinese families in China! Everyone should work with the people of the whole country, with practical actions, doubled efforts, and intensified efforts to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and pay attention to epidemic prevention and health work to respond to the American aggressors' atrocities of germ warfare!
    Overseas Chinese abroad! After everyone has further recognized the crimes of the American aggressors, they must further consolidate and expand the patriotic unity of overseas Chinese, strengthen the friendship between overseas Chinese and the local people, and jointly defend world peace with the peace-loving people all over the world!

### 张澜、章伯钧、何香凝发表书面谈话  指出美俘供词证明美国侵略者对其细菌战罪行的狡赖完全破产

    张澜、章伯钧、何香凝发表书面谈话
    指出美俘供词证明美国侵略者对其细菌战罪行的狡赖完全破产
    美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词再次暴露了美国侵略者进行细菌战的黑幕。中国民主同盟主席张澜、中国农工民主党中央执行委员会主席章伯钧、中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝为此发表书面谈话，痛斥美国侵略者抵赖进行细菌战的无耻行为。张澜说：美国侵略者在我国和朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行，早已为我国人民所组织的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”和国际民主法律工作者协会所派遣的调查团，在朝鲜前线和后方以及我国东北地区实地进行调查所得的大量罪证所证实了。五月六日报上公布的两个为美国华尔街所奴役、训练、派遣到朝鲜投掷细菌弹的美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词，更加充分地证明了美帝国主义是使用细菌武器的杀人犯。供词中暴露了美国侵略者发动细菌战的罪恶计划，是在极端秘密的情况下进行的，并且是经过了长时期的准备的。罪证已铁案如山，卑鄙无耻的美国侵略者虽欲狡辩抵赖也无可施其技了。
    章伯钧说：当美国侵略者发动细菌战的时候，我们曾根据美国侵略者所制造的许多罪恶的事实，证明它所发动的细菌战争，是蓄谋已久的。同时，我们曾断言，美国侵略者使用违反人道的细菌武器，正是暴露了侵略者的日暮途穷。现在，我们从两个亲身投掷细菌弹的美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词里，更进一步证明我们的断言是正确的。
    美国侵略者现在仍旧是百般无耻地企图狡赖它在中朝两国所进行的细菌战的罪行，并曾指使着奥地利反动政府，禁止了布兰德魏纳教授报告美国侵略者在中国和朝鲜进行细菌战的罪恶事实。美国侵略者这种卑鄙无耻的手段，是掩饰不了铁证如山的血腥事实的。美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词，不仅给华尔街的大亨们一个无情的回答，而且对美国侵略者发动非人道的细菌战的真相和经过提供了很完备的补充。
    美国侵略者在中朝两国进行细菌战的滔天罪行，早已是铁证如山了。在铁的事实面前狡赖永远只是狡赖而已。人民日报五月六日的社论说：“裁判美国细菌战罪行的日子临近了。”诚然，全世界爱好和平的人民曾一致声言予侵略者以严厉的制裁，这个日子已经是不远了！
    何香凝说：美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的罪行，早就铁证如山，激起了全世界爱好正义的人民的公愤。最近，被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军俘获的美国空军人员伊纳克和奎恩两人，又亲笔写了供词，再一次提供美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证。至此，美国侵略者那些疯狂的野兽，更加无法抵赖他们的滔天罪行了。
    我生平是不愿轻易骂人为野兽的。但是对于美国那些灭绝人性的侵略者，除了“疯狂的野兽”一语，我实在找不到更适当的形容词。他们冒天下之大不韪，进行大规模的细菌战，不但要虐杀中朝的士兵，还企图虐杀中朝的妇孺，这比任何野兽还更凶暴，而且任何野兽断不像他们的狠毒，也断不像他们的卑鄙！
    在国内的华侨眷属们！大家要和全国人民一道，用实际的行动，加倍的努力，加紧抗美援朝，注重防疫卫生工作，来回答美国侵略者进行细菌战的暴行！
    在国外的侨胞们！大家更进一步地认清了美国侵略者的罪行之后，要更加巩固和扩大华侨爱国大团结，还要加强华侨和当地人民的友谊，和全世界爱好正义的人民共同保卫世界和平！
