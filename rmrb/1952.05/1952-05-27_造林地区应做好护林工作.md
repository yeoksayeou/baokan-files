    Afforestation Areas Should Do a Good Job in Forest Protection
    Comrade Editor: This spring, the sand areas of Pei County and Hua Shan County in the Teng County Special District of Shandong Province were afforested. The masses were happy to see that neat young trees were planted on all the sand, and said happily: In the future, we will no longer be hit by sand, and when the trees grow up, they can not only meet the needs of national construction projects, but also burning firewood will not be a problem. However, the local government does not pay enough attention to forest protection. Some people, in groups of three or five, dig hair roots in the forest land, causing damage to the seedlings. For example, in various villages in Xiaoji Township, Fifth District of Pei County, people dig in the forest land every day, and many small seedlings are dug up. In Li Jiazhuang, Zongji Township, Fifth District of Hua Shan County, Xu Wanchuan led more than ten people to dig grass roots in the forest land of Li Lao Zhuang in the Third District. Li Hei, the forest ranger of Li Lao Zhuang, went to stop them, but was beaten instead. Therefore, the general public believes that "afforestation is easy, but forest protection is difficult." I suggest that afforestation areas should not only focus on afforestation, but also strengthen forest protection at the same time, so that seedlings can develop and grow safely.

    造林地区应做好护林工作
    编辑同志：今年春天山东滕县专区在沛县、华山县的沙滩地区进行造林，群众看见沙滩上全部种上了整齐的幼林，都高兴地说：今后可以不再挨沙子打了，将来树木长大，不但可供国家建筑工程需要，而且烧柴也不成问题了。但是当地政府对护林工作还不够重视，某些群众三五成群地到林地掘毛根，致使苗木受到损失。如沛县五区小集乡各村庄每天都有人在林地挖掘，很多小苗都被刨掉。华山县五区宗集乡李家庄有个徐万川，带领十余人到三区李老庄林地掘草根，李老庄护林员李黑去阻止，反而被打了一顿。因此，一般群众便认为“造林容易护林难”了。我建议造林地区，不要光顾造林，应同时加强护林工作，使苗木安全发育生长。
