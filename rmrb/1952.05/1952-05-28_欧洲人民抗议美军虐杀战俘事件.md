Xinhua News Agency, May 27th:

    People in various European countries continue to protest angrily against the U.S. imperialists' bloody atrocities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and demand severe punishment for the executioners who committed the atrocities.
    In many enterprises and buildings, in institutions and schools, and in countless villages in Poland, workers have unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialists' atrocities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The resolution passed by the All-Poland Sugar Workers and Advanced Agricultural Workers Conference stated: The monstrous crimes of the U.S. imperialists have shocked us greatly. We protest with unparalleled anger against the U.S. imperialists' acts of complete violation of international law. We demand an immediate end to the atrocities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island. We demand severe punishment for the culprits who presided over these monstrous crimes. The Red Cross’s Lodz branch, the Workers' Congress of the Pomorze Machine Manufacturing Factory, and the workers of the Warsaw Electrical Equipment Factory also passed resolutions protesting the atrocities of the American aggressors. Staff members of the Sierzan Textile Factory in Bialystok passed a resolution demanding an immediate halt to the barbaric acts of terror perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists against defenseless Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island. All members of the Poznan City People's Council passed a resolution stating that, regarding the crimes in the prisoner-of-war camps, we must not only accuse those who committed these crimes but also the American authorities. We demand that an international tribunal punish those who murdered unarmed prisoners of war in the concentration camps on Koje Island. A protest rally was held in Lodz. Zofia Wasilkowska, a member of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team that investigated the crimes of the U.S. imperialists in Korea, delivered a lengthy speech at the rally. The rally passed a resolution strongly protesting the U.S. imperialists' flagrant violation of international law, demanding an immediate end to the cruel and sinful treatment of defenseless Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on Koje Island, and demanding severe punishment for the war criminals who committed these heinous crimes. The "Voice of Labor," the organ of the Polish Central Council of Trade Unions, representing the views of the broadest sections of the Polish people, published an editorial stating: The Koje Island incident is a new link in the overall chain of imperialist crimes. Under this system, there have emerged people who attempt to exterminate the heroic Korean people who are bravely defending their national independence with the help of plague, cholera, and typhoid. Those who commit these crimes are the same people who are reviving the Wehrmacht in West Germany and clamoring for new massacres. These are the crimes committed by enemies of humanity who get rich off the dead. The newspaper called on all honest people to unite in a united front against American criminals and in a united front for peace. "People's Tribune" wrote in an article entitled "Another Massacre in Korea": The sound of guns used by American executioners to slaughter prisoners of war in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp is still faintly audible, but world opinion is shocked by the news of the massacre of prisoners of war by U.S. imperialists in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp. The newspaper pointed out that all the people of Poland are deeply indignant at the atrocities committed by the U.S. military in Korea.
    The people of Czechoslovakia condemned the crimes of the U.S. imperialists in Korea with unparalleled anger. The "Red Right Newspaper" of the 23rd stated: Our people are all indignant at these crimes, and we demand that not only all the executors of these crimes but also all the instigators of these crimes be severely punished. The newspaper also published a statement by representatives of all walks of life in Czechoslovakia, who sharply condemned the bloody crimes of the American aggressors against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Czechoslovak newspapers and periodicals published many letters of protest from workers, peasants, and intellectuals, protesting the maltreatment of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by American warmongers. Bratislava's "Truth Newspaper" wrote: After the bloody terrorist incident on Koje Island was exposed, world opinion expressed great anger. The atrocities on Koje Island prove that the American demons who are trying to dominate the world are the direct successors of the Hitler killing gang. "People's Defense Newspaper" wrote: Peace-loving people all over the world unanimously demand that the U.S. imperialists' despicable massacres and bestial acts in Korea be stopped.
    The Hungarian "Free People's Newspaper" wrote in an editorial entitled "The Disgraceful Failure of the American Aggressors": Not a day goes by without news of the American aggressors' disgraceful crimes in Korea. The tide of universal condemnation of the Koje Island bloodshed has not yet subsided, and American executioners have committed new crimes in Busan. The newspaper continued: Exposing the atrocities on Koje Island is of particular significance because this incident shows that the U.S. government and the U.S. military command are attempting to disrupt the Korean armistice negotiations. The U.S. military's crimes in the prisoner-of-war camps expose the despicable nature of U.S. policy, expose the means by which Wall Street attempts to guarantee world hegemony, and give a true estimate of their talk of democracy, humanitarianism, and freedom. The heroism of the prisoners of war on Koje Island proves that no amount of bloody terror by the aggressors can subdue them.
    Newspapers in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, continued to publish articles, resolutions, and letters from Romanian workers expressing their angry protests against the atrocities committed by American interventionists on Koje Island. "Spark Newspaper" wrote in an editorial on the 23rd entitled "Stop the Crimes of the American Fascists": The news that American aggressors have committed horrific atrocities on Koje Island, which has become an island of death, has aroused a wave of indignation and protest around the world. Millions of peace-loving people around the world believe that American crimes in Korea are a direct threat to their own homes and to the people of their own countries. While resolutely demanding an immediate end to the U.S. military's bestial acts in Korea, workers are raising their vigilance and working harder to thwart the sinister plans of the U.S. imperialists. The newspaper continued, saying that the Romanian people, together with the progressive forces of the world, express their sincere love and brotherly solidarity to the warriors who bravely defend Korea, and demand that "the bestial acts of the American savages in Korea be stopped, and that the users of plague and cholera bacteria, the most ferocious enemies of peace and progress—American criminals—be severely punished."
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause Newspaper" wrote in an editorial on the 22nd: For two years, the American aggressors have continuously committed atrocities in Korea, causing the land of the heroic Korean people to be covered in blood. The U.S. military has inherited the mantle of the Hitler gang and is now continuing to commit the atrocities that the Hitler beastly army committed in the Auschwitz and Maidaneck concentration camps, but on a larger scale and with more vicious methods. Koje Island has become the American Maidaneck, where Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are subjected to unbelievably cruel abuse. Thousands of prisoners of war have become victims of sinful plague and typhoid bacteria experiments. The American executioners are planning to hand over the heroic sons and daughters of China and Korea to the Kuomintang bandits and the traitorous Syngman Rhee, to be used as cannon fodder in the war against their people. But no matter how cruel the means or how barbaric the actions, they will ultimately not help the American aggressors. The great Korean people are shattering all the conspiracies of the American interventionists to conquer Korea and turn it into a colony. The Korean people are invincible because they have the support of all honest people in the world in their struggle against American aggression. The patriots of Korea and China would rather die than betray their country and obey the executioners' orders to fight against their own people. Although the American savages are more ferocious and despicable than the Hitler bandits, they are still helpless in the face of these patriotic heroes. The newspaper concluded: Peace-loving people are extremely indignant at the atrocities committed by the American bandits on Koje Island. The Bulgarian people, along with all peace-loving people, condemn the crimes of the American aggressors in Korea.
    The Swedish newspaper "Norrskensflamman," when discussing the appalling crimes of the American aggressors in Korea, especially the persecution of prisoners of war, wrote: The American aggressors are slaughtering prisoners of war in Korea, razing cities and villages to the ground, and carrying out mass massacres, and all of this is being done in the name of the United Nations. The newspaper reminded everyone that several reactionary American newspapers have so shamelessly described the bombing of Korean cities and villages with napalm bombs, even promoting this crime as an expression of Western European civilization, democracy, and humanity. News propagandists (including those in Sweden) are painstakingly covering up the heinous crimes of Western countries and the United Nations in Korea. The newspaper wrote: Truth must prevail, and those who created these crimes are no longer qualified to be called civilized people.

    欧洲人民抗议美军虐杀战俘事件
    【新华社二十七日讯】欧洲各国人民继续愤怒地抗议美帝国主义对朝中战俘的血腥暴行，并要求严惩制造暴行的刽子手。
    在波兰许多企业和建筑物里，在机关和学校里，在千千万万的乡村里，劳动者一致愤慨地声讨美帝国主义者对朝鲜和中国战俘的暴行。全波兰糖业工人与先进农业工人大会通过的决议说：美帝国主义者的滔天罪行使我们大为震惊。我们以无比的愤怒抗议美帝国主义者完全违反国际公法的行为。我们要求立即停止对巨济岛朝中战俘的暴行。我们要求严惩主持这种滔天罪行的罪魁。红十字会罗兹市分会、波莫尔兹机器制造工厂工人大会和华沙电气器材工厂工人也都通过决议，抗议美国侵略者的暴行。比亚里斯多克地方的塞尔赞纺织厂内的工作人员通过决议，要求立即制止美帝国主义者对巨济岛上朝中战俘所进行的野蛮的恐怖行为。波斯南市人民议会的全体人员通过决议说，对于战俘营内的罪行，我们不但要控诉那些犯这种罪行的人们，并且还要控诉美国当局。我们要求国际法庭惩办那些谋害巨济岛上集中营内手无寸铁的战俘的人们。罗兹举行了一次抗议大会。参加调查美帝国主义者在朝鲜罪行的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团团员华西尔考夫斯卡在会上发表了长篇演说。大会通过决议坚决抗议美帝国主义者悍然违反国际法的行为，要求立即停止对巨济岛上赤手空拳的朝中战俘的残酷而罪恶的待遇，要求严惩犯有这些凶恶罪行的战犯。波兰工会中央理事会机关报“劳动之声”代表波兰最广泛阶层的意见，发表社论说：巨济岛事件是帝国主义罪行总环节中新的一环。在这一体系下便产生了这样的人：他们企图靠鼠疫、霍乱和伤寒的帮助来消灭英勇保卫祖国独立的朝鲜人民。制造这种罪行的是那些在西德使国防军复活、为新的屠杀而奔走呼号的人。这是那些靠死人发财的人类公敌干出来的罪行。该报号召一切正直的人们团结在反对美国罪犯的统一战线里，团结在争取和平的统一战线里。“人民论坛报”在以“朝鲜又发生屠杀事件”为题的文章中写道：美国刽子手残杀巨济岛俘虏营中战俘的枪声依然隐隐在耳，可是世界舆论又为美帝国主义者在釜山战俘营屠杀战俘的消息所震惊了。该报指出，波兰全体人民对美军在朝鲜的暴行深为愤慨。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民以无比的愤怒谴责美帝国主义者在朝鲜的罪行。二十三日的“红色权利报”说：我国人民对这些罪行莫不感到愤怒，我们要求不仅要严惩这些罪行的所有执行者，并且要严惩这些罪行的所有主使者。该报并发表捷克斯洛伐克各界人民代表的声明，他们尖锐地谴责美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国战俘的血腥罪行。捷克斯洛伐克各报刊载许多件工人、农民和知识分子的抗议书，他们抗议美国黩武主义者对朝、中战俘进行虐待。布拉的斯拉发的“真理报”写道：巨济岛血腥恐怖事件被揭露后，全世界舆论一致表示非常愤怒。巨济岛上的暴行证明：力图称霸世界的美国恶魔是希特勒杀人匪帮的直接继承者。“人民防线报”写道：全世界爱好和平的人民一致要求制止美帝国主义在朝鲜所干的卑劣屠杀和兽行。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”在题为“美国侵略者的可耻失败”的社论中写道：没有一天不传来美国侵略者在朝鲜的可耻罪行的消息。举世一致谴责巨济岛流血事件的浪潮还没有下去，美国刽子手又在釜山进行新的罪行了。该报继称：揭发巨济岛暴行是有特别意义的，因为这件事表明，美国政府与美军司令部企图破坏朝鲜停战谈判。美军在战俘营的罪行暴露了美国政策的卑鄙本相，暴露了华尔街企图用以保证世界霸权的手段，并且把他们所侈谈的民主、人道主义和自由这一类大话给了一个真实的估价。巨济岛战俘的英雄气概证明，侵略者任何血腥恐怖都不能使他们屈服。
    罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特报纸继续刊载罗马尼亚劳动者对美国干涉者在巨济岛暴行表示愤怒抗议的文章、决议和信件。“火花报”二十三日在题为
    “制止美国法西斯分子的罪行”的社论中写道：美国侵略者在已经变成死亡岛的巨济岛上干出骇人听闻的暴行，这个消息激起了全世界的愤慨和抗议的浪潮。全世界千百万和平拥护者认为美国在朝鲜的罪行就是对他们自己的家、对他们本国人民的直接威胁。劳动者一方面坚决要求立即制止美军在朝鲜的兽行，一方面提高自己的警惕，为粉碎美帝国主义者的阴险计划而加倍努力奋斗。该报继称，罗马尼亚人民与全世界进步力量一道，对英勇保卫朝鲜的战士表示热诚的敬爱和兄弟的声援，并要求“制止美国野人在朝鲜的兽行，使鼠疫和霍乱细菌的使用者、和平与进步最凶恶的敌人——美国凶犯受到严厉制裁”。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”二十二日的社论写道：两年以来美国侵略者不断在朝鲜制造暴行，使英雄的朝鲜人民的土地上流遍了鲜血。美国军队承袭希特勒匪帮的衣钵，现在继续干着希特勒兽军在奥斯威辛和麦丹尼克集中营干的暴行，而且规模更大，手段更毒辣。巨济岛变成了美国的麦丹尼克，在那里朝中战俘遭受着难以置信的残酷的虐待。成千的战俘成为罪恶的鼠疫与伤寒细菌试验的牺牲品。美国刽子手正打算把中国与朝鲜的英雄儿女交给国民党匪帮和朝鲜人民的叛徒李承晚，作为进行反对他们人民的战争的炮灰。但是不论手段怎么残酷，行动怎么野蛮，终归是帮助不了美国侵略者的。伟大的朝鲜人民粉碎着美国干涉者征服朝鲜、把它变成殖民地的一切阴谋。朝鲜人民是不可战胜的，因为在他们抵抗美国侵略的斗争中有全世界所有正直的人作后盾。朝鲜与中国的爱国者宁死也决不背弃祖国听从刽子手的命令去和自己的人民作战，美国野人虽然比希特勒匪帮更加凶残卑鄙，然而在这些爱国志士面前仍然毫无办法。该报在结语中说：爱好和平的人民对美国强盗在巨济岛的暴行极为愤慨。保加利亚人民跟一切爱好和平的人民一道谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜的罪行。
    瑞典“诺尔生斯法曼”报谈到美国侵略者在朝鲜的惊人罪行，特别是迫害战俘一事时写道：美国侵略者在朝鲜残杀战俘，把城市和乡村夷为平地，进行大批屠杀，而这一切都是用联合国名义干出来的。该报提醒大家说：有几家美国反动报纸如此无耻地描述用凝固汽油弹轰炸朝鲜城市和乡村的情形，竟把这种罪行宣扬成为西欧文明、民主和人道的表现。新闻宣传家（包括瑞典的在内）处心积虑地掩饰西方国家和联合国在朝鲜的滔天罪行。该报写道：真理必定胜利，而那些一手制造这些罪行的人已经没有资格称为文明人了。
