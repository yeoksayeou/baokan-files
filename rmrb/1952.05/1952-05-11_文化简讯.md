	Cultural Briefs
	▲ The Cultural Work Troupe of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission, in order to integrate with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and to cooperate with the troops' training tasks, has produced a play "Accusation" and Shandong Quick Tales, Single String Musical Instruments, and dance programs. They were divided into three work teams and went deep into the troops to carry out extensive performances.
	The acrobatics and ballad singing work team set off in early April to perform for the troops. The cadres and soldiers were deeply moved after watching, and they said: "Chairman Mao gives us such good programs to watch, we must train well." The performances of programs such as Torch, Knife Fire Net, Springboard, and Vehicle Skills have further promoted the troops' training and sports activities. Cooks and feeders happily talked about it while cooking and walking horses. In particular, programs such as "Flying Tiger Mountain" and "A Cart of High-Quality Grain" sang about the real deeds of the heroes of the troops, so they were even more moved when they watched, saying: "Chairman Mao knows our heroic deeds!" They told new heroic and model deeds, providing the team with a lot of valuable creative materials, and wrote letters of condolences. When parting, many comrades even took out their precious merit commemoration albums and medals and gave them to outstanding actors.
	The drama and dance performance team, in its tour performances in the companies, not only adopted a combat-oriented performance style but also eradicated the past bourgeois artistic viewpoints that emphasized form and extravagance. For example, the scenery and lighting were equipped with soft scenery and lightweight equipment, and the actors also worked as stage workers. In order to meet the requirements of the broad masses of soldiers, the comrades showed a high degree of work enthusiasm, in addition to performing two shows day and night, they went to the companies every morning to teach songs, hold forums, and tutor the company's cultural activities. They firmly grasped the principle of "both a performance team and a work team." Therefore, they won the love and welcome of all commanders and fighters.
	Another team performed the play "Accusation" in Beijing. In addition to entertaining the various agencies and troops stationed in Beijing, public performances were held to meet the requirements of the broad masses of workers, students, and citizens.

    文化简讯
    ▲中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部文工团为了结合“三反”“五反”运动、配合部队练兵任务，排出了话剧“控诉”及山东快书、单弦和舞蹈等节目，分成三个工作队，分别深入部队，进行广泛演出。
    杂技曲艺工作队已于四月初出发，到各部队演出。干部、战士看了之后很受感动，他们表示：“毛主席给我们这么好的节目看，我们一定要很好的练兵”。像火把、刀火网、跳板、车技等节目的演出，更推动了部队的练兵和体育运动。炊事员、饲养员们，在做饭和蹓马时都高兴地谈论着。尤其是说唱“飞虎山”、“一车高粮米”等节目，因为说唱的都是部队英雄的实事，所以他们看了更加感动地说：“毛主席都知道了我们的英雄事迹！”他们纷纷讲叙新的英雄模范事迹，供给该队很多宝贵的创作材料；并纷纷写信慰劳。临别的时候，甚至有很多同志把他们宝贵的功臣纪念册和纪念章拿出来送给优秀的演员。
    戏剧舞蹈演出队在深入连队的巡回演出中，不但采取了战斗化的演出作风，而且根除了过去讲究形式、铺张的资产阶级艺术观点。如布景、灯光等配用软景及轻便器材，演员兼作舞台工作等。为了满足广大战士的要求，同志们发挥了高度的工作热情，除每天演出日夜两场外，并在每天上午分头到连队去教歌、开座谈会，辅导连队文艺活动。他们紧紧掌握住“既是演出队又是工作队”的原则。因此获得全体指战员同志的热爱与欢迎。
    另一个队在北京演出话剧“控诉”。除招待驻京各机关、部队外，为了满足广大工人、学生及市民群众的要求，举行公演。
