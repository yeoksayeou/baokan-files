    Letters from Families of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean Front Inspire the Fighting Will of the Soldiers

    To the Editor: I work in a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Recently, the comrades in our company received letters from their respective families. In these letters, the families of the Chinese People's Volunteers reported the lofty honors they had received at home and the help they had been given. Squad Leader Guo Shouzong received a letter from home saying, "After the news of your meritorious service arrived home, the county people's government held a meeting of military families and presented our family with farm tools and other prizes. This is the glory the great motherland has given us. You must strive to kill the enemy to repay the motherland." Gunner Wu Lin of the Second Squad received a letter from home saying, "The family received a new house in the land reform, and also received land, and someone is farming and planting it for us. You should work hard to kill the enemy at the front, so as to repay Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland." Observer Xu Delin received a letter from home saying, "The substitute farming group assures our family that they will cultivate meticulously and strive for a bumper harvest." Soldier Fan Xingju received a letter from home saying, "Our family not only received land, but the children are also in school. Your brother was also elected village chief. You must work hard to fight the American devils to protect our happy days." These letters from the motherland not only inspired the recipients themselves, but also inspired all of us, making us feel that the people of the motherland love us very much, but our contribution to the motherland is too little. We are determined to continue to strive for meritorious service in order to repay the care and honor given to our families by the people of the motherland.

    志愿军家属寄到朝鲜前线的
    信鼓舞着志愿军战士们的斗志
    编辑同志：我是在志愿军某部工作的。我们连里的同志们最近收到一些从各自家里寄来的信件。在这些信件中，志愿军家属报告了他们在家里所得到的崇高荣誉和受到帮助的情况。一班班长郭守宗接到的家信上说：“你的立功报喜信到家后，县人民政府就召开了军属会，赠给了我家农具等奖品。这是伟大祖国给咱的光荣。你要努力杀敌，以报答祖国。”二班炮手吴林接到的家信上说：“家里在土地改革中分到了新房子，而且还分到了地，并有人代耕代种。你在前方尽管努力杀敌，好报答毛主席和祖国人民。”观测员许德林接到的家信上说：“代耕组向我们家里保证，要精耕细作，争取丰收。”战士范兴具接到的家信上说：“我家不但分得了土地，而且孩子也上了学。你哥哥还当选了村长。你要努力打击美国鬼子，以保卫我们幸福的日子。”这些从祖国寄来的信，不但鼓舞了收信者本人，而且鼓舞了我们全体同志，使我们感到，祖国人民十分热爱我们，我们对祖国的贡献却太少。我们决心继续争取立功，以报答祖国人民对我们家庭的照顾和给予的荣誉。    康健雄
