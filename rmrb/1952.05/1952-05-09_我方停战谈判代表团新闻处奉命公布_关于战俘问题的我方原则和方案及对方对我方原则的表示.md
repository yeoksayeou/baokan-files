Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 8th: The Press Office of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation to the Ceasefire Negotiations is ordered to announce the following three documents regarding our principles and proposals on the issue of prisoners of war and the other side's two statements regarding our principles:

    (1) The clause on the principles of prisoner repatriation proposed by our side at the staff officers' meeting on Item 4 of the agenda on March 21st.
    (2) The original text of the understanding on the adjusted principles of prisoner repatriation proposed by our side at the staff officers' meeting on Item 4 of the agenda on March 27th.
    (3) The other side's statement regarding our side's principles of prisoner repatriation on March 25th.
    (4) The other side's statement regarding our side's principles of prisoner repatriation on March 21st on April 1st.
    (5) The original text of the solution to the three issues proposed by our side at the administrative meeting of both delegations on May 2nd.

    (1) The clause on the principles of prisoner repatriation proposed by our side at the staff officers' meeting on Item 4 of the agenda on March 21st: "After the signing and entry into force of the Armistice Agreement, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shall release and repatriate all 11,559 prisoners of war in their custody, and the United Nations Command shall release and repatriate all 132,474 prisoners of war in their custody. The above lists of prisoners of war shall be finalized by the staff officers of both sides."

    (2) The original text of the understanding on the adjusted principles of prisoner repatriation proposed by our side at the staff officers' meeting on Item 4 of the agenda on March 27th: "In order to quickly resolve Item 4 of the agenda and achieve an armistice in Korea as soon as possible, our side is now willing to make another effort to propose the following understanding on the adjusted principles of repatriation under the general principles stipulated in our proposal of March 21st:

    (1) All non-Korean United Nations Command prisoners of war held by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and all Korean prisoners of war who originally resided in your area shall be fully repatriated. All non-Korean Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war held by the United Nations Command and all Korean prisoners of war who originally resided in our area shall be fully repatriated.

    (2) All Korean prisoners of war who originally resided in our area and were held by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and all Korean prisoners of war who originally resided in your area and were held by the United Nations Command, shall be repatriated, except for those who are willing to return to their original place of residence."

    (3) The other side's statement regarding our side's principles of prisoner repatriation on March 25th: "The proposal of March 21st, after appropriate adjustments, could well constitute a suitable basis for such a solution."

    (4) The other side's statement on April 1st regarding our side's March 21st prisoner repatriation principle, which said, "The United Nations Command will release and repatriate all 132,474 prisoners of war in its custody": "We believe that 132,000 does not take all relevant factors into account, and therefore seems to be too high a number. We have indicated that perhaps 116,000 would more closely represent the magnitude of the exchange."

    (5) The original text of the solution to the three issues proposed by our side at the administrative meeting of both delegations on May 2nd: "In order to achieve an armistice in Korea as soon as possible and to satisfy the initial aspirations of the tens of millions of peace-loving people in the world, our side is willing, on the condition that your side accepts our reasonable compromise solution to the prisoner of war issue and abandons your demand to interfere in our internal affairs by restricting airport facilities in Korea, to consider accepting your proposal to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission composed of four neutral countries in the matter of nominating neutral countries. I must clearly point out that the plan proposed by our side is an indivisible whole. Our side's concession on the issue of nominating neutral countries is premised on your side abandoning the unreasonable demand to restrict airports and agreeing to our compromise solution on the issue of prisoners of war as an indispensable prerequisite."

    我方停战谈判代表团新闻处奉命公布
    关于战俘问题的我方原则和方案及对方对我方原则的表示
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团新闻处奉命公布关于战俘问题的我方原则和方案三件及对方对我方原则的表示二件如下：
    （一）三月二十一日第四项议程参谋会上我方所提遣俘原则条文。
    （二）三月二十七日第四项议程参谋会上我方所提遣俘调整原则的谅解原文。
    （三）三月二十五日对方对我方三月二十一日遣俘原则的表示。
    （四）四月一日对方对我方三月二十一日遣俘原则的表示。
    （五）五月二日我方在双方代表团大会行政性会议上提出的关于三个问题的解决方案原文。
    （一）三月二十一日第四项议程参谋会上，我方所提遣俘原则条文：“在停战协定签字并生效后，朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军方面释放并遣返其所收容的一万一千五百五十九名全部战俘，联合国军方面释放并遣返其所收容的十三万二千四百七十四名全部战俘。上述战俘名单由双方参谋人员予以最后校正。”
    （二）三月二十七日在第四项议程参谋会上我方所提遣俘调整原则的谅解原文：“为了迅速解决第四项议程，早日实现朝鲜停战，我方现在愿作再一次的努力，提出在我方三月二十一日提案总的原则规定下的关于具体规定遣返的调整原则的谅解如下：
    （1）所有朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军所收容的非朝鲜籍的联合国军战俘和所有原居住于你方地区的朝鲜籍战俘应予全部遣返，所有联合国军所收容的非朝鲜籍的中国人民志愿军战俘和所有原居住于我方地区的朝鲜籍战俘应予全部遣返。
    （2）所有朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军所收容的原居住于我方地区的朝鲜籍战俘及所有联合国军所收容的原居住于你方地区的朝鲜籍战俘，除愿返回其原住地区者可不予遣返外，应予遣返。”
    （三）三月二十五日对方对我方三月二十一日遣俘原则的表示：“三月二十一日的提案，经过一适当调整，很可能构成这种解决方案的适宜的基础。”
    （四）四月一日对方对我方三月二十一日遣俘原则中“联合国军方面释放并遣返其所收容的十三万二千四百七十四名全部战俘”一句的表示：“我们认为十三万二千是没有把一切有关的因素都考虑在内，因此，似乎是一个太高了的数字。我们指出过，可能十一万六千能更近似地表示出交换数量的大小。”
    （五）五月二日我方在双方代表团大会行政性会议上提出的关于三个问题的解决方案原文：“为了早日实现朝鲜的停战，满足世界千万爱好和平人民的初步愿望，我方愿在你方接受我方对战俘问题的合理折衷的解决方案，并放弃你方限制朝鲜境内机场设备的干涉我方内政的要求的条件下，在中立国提名问题上考虑接受你方提出的，以四个中立国家组成中立国监察委员会的方案。我必须明白无误地指出，我方提出的方案是一个不可分割的整体。我方在中立国提名问题上的让步，是以你方放弃限制机场的无理要求，并在战俘问题上同意我方的折衷方案为其不可缺的前提的。”
