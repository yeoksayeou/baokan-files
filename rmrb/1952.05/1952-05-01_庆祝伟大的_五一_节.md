　　Celebrating the Great "May Day" Festival
    Ma Yinchu
    We must resolutely establish the ideological leadership of the working class.
    Criticize bourgeois ideology and eliminate reactionary ideology!
    This year's May Day has particularly important significance for us.
    In the festival of international laboring people's solidarity, we must further consolidate our gains in the "Three-Anti" movement and enhance our understanding.
    Our teachers have initially criticized their own bourgeois ideology, clearly recognized the ideology of the working class, and achieved significant results on the ideological front. Everyone will surely celebrate this great festival with extremely pleasant feelings; and will continue to use criticism and self-criticism to continuously conduct self-education and self-transformation, in order to become outstanding educators, truly worthy of being glorious people's teachers, and cultivate more construction talents for our great motherland.
    Our students have also drawn a clear line between bourgeois ideology and working-class ideology in this "Three-Anti" movement, and realized that only by arming themselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can they truly become outstanding cadres of the motherland. The students who have been liberated from the influence of bourgeois ideology and have received working-class ideological education will surely celebrate May Day with joy and excitement, and will make stricter demands on themselves, constantly strive to improve themselves, be good students of Chairman Mao, and meet the standard of "being both talented and virtuous, physically fit, and possessing a high level of communist consciousness."
    The staff of our school have also washed away the dirt and poison left over from the old society in this "Three-Anti" movement, uprooted some weeds, and unyieldingly persisted in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. During this May Day, everyone will surely be able to appreciate the great significance of participating in the ranks of the revolutionary working class, and participate in the celebration with excitement, and from then on encourage each other, establish a work style of integrity, simplicity, and close ties with the masses, and continue to cultivate themselves into outstanding national work cadres.
    In this great "Three-Anti" movement, we also waged a merciless struggle against the reactionary thoughts of feudal comprador fascism that violated the Common Program, and drew a clear line between ourselves and the enemy. Everyone demands the elimination of these reactionary thoughts that can never continue to exist in the People's University, and demands that the cultural and educational policies stipulated by the Common Program be thoroughly implemented in our school.
    After this "Three-Anti" movement, an unprecedented unity has emerged among the teachers, students, and staff of the entire school, and the entire Peking University has a new atmosphere. This great unity will be a huge force for us to gradually build and develop the new People's Peking University.
    This year's May Day is an important milestone in our progress. Let us advance more confidently under the glorious banner of the great Chairman Mao!

    我们的同学们也在这次“三反”运动中划清了资产阶级思想和工人阶级思想的界限，认识到了只有以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来武装自己，才能真正成为祖国的优秀干部。从资产阶级思想影响下解放出来，接受了工人阶级思想教育的同学们，一定会欢欣鼓舞地庆祝五一劳动节，并且对自己作更严格的要求，不断努力提高自己，作毛主席的好学生，以符合“才德兼备，体魄健全，具有高度共产主义觉悟水平”的标准。

    在这次伟大的“三反”运动中，我们还对违反共同纲领的封建买办法西斯主义的反动思想进行了无情的斗争，划清了敌我界限。大家都要求肃清这些决不能在人民的大学中继续存在的反动思想，要求共同纲领所规定的文教政策在我们学校中彻底实现。
    经过了这次“三反”运动，全校师生员工之间出现了空前未有的大团结，整个北京大学有了一片新的气象。这种大团结将是我们逐步建设和发展人民的新北大的巨大力量。
    今年的五一节是我们前进的一个重要的里程碑。让我们在伟大的毛主席的光辉旗帜之下更加充满信心地前进罢！
