Distinguished Leaders, Comrades:

Our Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, after returning to the motherland, has spent more than four months carrying out our work. As Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the China Peace Committee said just now, our work has achieved some results. But these achievements were made possible by the full assistance of the China Peace Committee and its local branches, the assistance of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the political departments of the military regions, and the warm love and help of governments at all levels and the people of the whole country. Therefore, on behalf of the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the China Peace Committee and its local branches, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the political departments of the military regions, governments at all levels, and the people of the whole country. At the same time, I propose a toast to the good health of our great Chairman Mao, and to the final victory of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea against aggression!

    李雪三团长的答词
    各位首长、各位同志：
    我们志愿军归国代表团，回到祖国以后，经过了四个多月的时间，来进行我们的工作。正如抗美援朝总会彭真副主席刚才所说，我们的工作已取得一些成绩。但这些成绩的取得，是因为有抗美援朝总会和各地分会的全力协助，是因为有中国人民革命军事委员会总政治部与各军区政治部的协助，是因为有各级政府和全国人民热情爱戴与帮助才取得的。因此我要代表志愿军归国代表团对中国人民抗美援朝总会和各地分会、中国人民革命军事委员会总政治部及各军区政治部、各地政府、全国人民致衷心的感谢。同时，我建议为了我们伟大的毛主席的身体健康，为了抗美援朝反侵略斗争的最后胜利而干杯！
