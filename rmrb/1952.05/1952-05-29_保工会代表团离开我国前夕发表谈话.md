Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Bulgarian Trade Union delegation, invited to China to attend the May Day celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of their departure from China:

The Bulgarian delegation feels particularly happy to be able to celebrate International Labor Day in great People's China with representatives of the working class from various countries and the Chinese working class.

We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese trade unions and the Chinese People's Government for enabling us, in a short period of time, to become unrestrictedly familiar with the life, culture, and great achievements of the Chinese people.

We would like to express our sincere thanks to the great Chinese people for the warm and fraternal hospitality we have received in every corner of their vast motherland during this period.

Everything we have seen in factories and villages demonstrates the tremendous upsurge in economic and cultural creativity, eloquently proving the unparalleled creative enthusiasm of the Chinese people in building a free, happy life and a great, peaceful, and democratic new China.

What we have seen also shows that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, headed by their beloved and great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are united as one, standing steadfastly within the peace camp, self-sacrificingly fighting to defend peace, and will resolutely chop off any evil bloody hands that dare to infringe upon their freedom, independence, and national sovereignty.

After returning to our country, we will report to our people on the tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in a short period of time, on China's boundless love for peace-loving people, and on the deep hatred for instigators of new wars. This will promote the consolidation of the friendship between the Bulgarian and Chinese people, who, although separated by vast distances, are closely linked by common interests and common tasks—building their own happy new lives, and under the leadership of the great Soviet Union and the genius Stalin, jointly fighting against the instigators of new wars and defending world peace.

Let us once again thank the Chinese people for their warm and fraternal hospitality, and wish them future achievements and a happier life.

Long live the heroic, peace-loving Chinese people and their great leader Mao Zedong!

    保工会代表团离开我国前夕发表谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】应邀来我国参加五一节观礼的保加利亚工会代表团，在离开中国前夕，发表书面谈话如下：
    保加利亚代表团特别地感到幸福：能够在伟大的人民中国与各国工人阶级的代表及中国的工人阶级一同庆祝五一国际劳动节。
    我们谨向中国的工会和中国人民政府表示衷心的感激，感谢他们使我们在短期内能够毫无限制地熟悉中国人民的生活、文化及其所获得的伟大成就。
    我们谨向伟大的中国人民表示恳切的谢意，感谢在这一时期内我们在他们广大祖国的每一角落所受到的热诚的、兄弟般的招待。
    我们在工厂和农村中所看到的一切，都说明了经济和文化的创造性的巨大高涨，雄辩地证明了中国人民在建设自由、幸福的生活和伟大和平民主的新中国方面的无比的创造的热情。
    我们所看到的也说明：中国人民在以其亲爱的伟大领袖毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下，万众一心地、坚定不渝地站立在和平阵营之内，自我牺牲地为保卫和平而斗争，并将坚决地斩断任何胆敢侵犯他们的自由、独立和国家主权的罪恶血手。
    我们回国以后将向我们的人民报告中国人民在短期所获得的巨大成就，报告中国对于爱好和平的人民的无限热爱和对新战争挑拨者的深切的仇恨。这将能促进保中两国人民友谊的巩固，他们虽为辽远的距离所分隔，但共同的利益和共同的任务——建设自己幸福的新生活，和在伟大的苏联和天才的斯大林的领导之下，共同为反对新战争挑拨者、保卫世界和平而斗争——却把他们紧密地联系起来。
    让我们再一次感谢中国人民的热情的兄弟般的招待，并为他们的未来成就与更幸福的生活而祝福。
    英雄的、爱好和平的中国人民及其伟大的领袖毛泽东万岁！
