Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and its subordinate units have promoted a large number of activists who emerged during the democratic reform, production, and "Three-Anti" movements to leadership positions at all levels. A total of 257 activists have been promoted.

After promoting these cadres, the bureau not only improved production leadership but also enhanced the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of the workers, and strengthened the ties between leaders and the masses, resulting in a new atmosphere in production. After being promoted to foreman, workers Yue Changan and Xiang Junling of the Kaifeng Station actively led workers to establish a soliciting team, mobilizing the masses to actively encourage public and private cargo owners to load their goods, exceeding the April loading task by one-fold. After Chen Linsheng, Liu Bingtai, Wang Lianxi, and others, who were loading and unloading workers at Weinan Station, were promoted to deputy director of the loading and unloading supply cooperative, dispatcher, and team leader respectively, they strengthened the connection between the freight transport team and the operation team, improved the organization of labor, and increased loading and unloading efficiency by 90 percent. The workers' production enthusiasm was also exceptionally high, and they actively launched production competitions.

Before promoting worker cadres, some cadres in various units, although verbally advocating for breaking with conservative thinking, had not fully overcome it in practice. For example, the cadre section's initial list of bureau-level and section-level cadres to be promoted in the management bureau included some individuals who were unqualified but merely had "experience." Yang Junqing, a member of the Youth League in the Finance Section, was a labor model and "tiger-beating" hero. He took the lead in reporting and uncovering more than 300 corruption cases during the "Three-Anti" movement and was commended by the National Railway Working Committee of the Youth League. However, some leading cadres were initially hesitant to boldly promote him. Some employees also initially believed, "Workers are uneducated; it is unprecedented for them to be section chiefs." "Such promotion is too fast." In response to this situation, the leaders of the Railway Bureau organized leading cadres and workers in various units to study relevant documents and held various meetings to repeatedly explain the policies, using the past achievements of many promoted worker cadres as examples, focusing on breaking conservative thinking.

In order to improve the leadership ability of these newly promoted cadres, the Railway Bureau and its branch bureaus are preparing to hold short-term training classes on a rotational basis.

    郑州铁路管理局及所属各单位
    提拔新干部担任领导工作
    加强了领导和群众的联系
    郑州铁路管理局及其所属各单位大量提拔在民主改革、生产和“三反”运动中涌现出来的积极分子，担任各级领导工作。被提拔的积极分子共有二百五十七名。
    该局在提拔这些干部以后，不仅健全了生产领导工作，并提高了职工的阶级觉悟和生产积极性，加强了领导和群众的联系，在生产上出现了新气象。开封车站工人岳长安、项俊领被提拔为领班后，积极领导工人成立招徕小组，发动群众四出动员公私货主装车，使四月份装车任务，超额一倍完成。渭南车站装卸工人陈林生、刘秉太和王连喜等分别被提拔为装卸供应社副主任、调度员和组长以后，加强了货运组、运转组的联系，改进了劳动组织，装卸效率提高了百分之九十。工人们的生产情绪也分外高涨，纷纷展开生产竞赛。
    在提拔工人干部前，各单位有些干部虽口头说要打破保守思想，但实际上思想并未完全打通。如干部科第一次提出管理局机关准备提拔的处、科长名单中，就有一部分是并不称职而徒然具有“资历”的人。而财务处青年团员杨俊清是劳动模范、“打虎”英雄，“三反”运动中曾带头检举、破获了三百多起贪污案件，得到青年团全国铁道工作委员会的通报和表扬，有些领导干部在开始时却不敢大胆提拔他。部分职工在开始时也认为：“工人没文化，当段长真是史无前例。”“这样提拔未免太快了。”针对这种情况，铁路管理局领导方面就组织各单位领导干部和工人群众学习有关文件，并举行各种会议，反复交代政策，并以过去许多被提拔的工人干部工作上的成绩为例，着重打破保守思想。
    为了提高这次新提拔干部的领导能力，铁路管理局和各分局最近准备举办短期训练班轮流训练。
