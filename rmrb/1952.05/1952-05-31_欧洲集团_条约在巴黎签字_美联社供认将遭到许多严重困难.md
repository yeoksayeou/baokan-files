Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: The so-called "European Defense Community" treaty, negotiated for a long time among France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the West German puppet government, was formally signed in Paris on May 27th. This is another sinister step by the imperialist bloc in Europe to prepare for war, following the signing of the so-called "General Treaty" in Bonn on the 26th by the United States, Britain, and France with the West German puppet government.

This treaty, which is to last for fifty years, is a tool manufactured by the United States to prepare for wars of aggression. Its main purpose is to rearm West Germany. The so-called "European Defense Community" is composed of the above five countries and West Germany. It will become a component part of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and will establish a "European Army," including twelve Nazi divisions, under the command of the North Atlantic Military Command. In this way, the most aggressive German militarists in Europe will be able to openly participate in the North Atlantic war alliance and become the main lackeys of the United States.

This treaty is also a tool for the United States to further enslave Western European countries. It clearly and specifically stipulates that the "European Defense Community" must receive various instructions from the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization" directly controlled by the United States. A committee that actually leads the "European Army" must make decisions "after consulting with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." In wartime, the "European Army" will be directly under the command of the North Atlantic aggressive forces command. In this way, not only West Germany, but also France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg must hand over their right to command their own troops to the United States, which means handing over their most important national defense sovereignty.

It is precisely because of this nature of the "European Defense Community" that this conspiracy manufactured by the United States has been fiercely opposed by the broad masses of the people in Western Europe from the very beginning, and has aroused suspicion among the ruling groups of Western European countries. First of all, in France, the French people understand that the "General Treaty" concluded between the United States, Britain, France, and the West German puppet government and the "European Defense Community Treaty," which drags West Germany into the North Atlantic bloc, weaken France's position and expose France to the threat of the West German militarism that is being restored. In the face of the strong opposition of the French people, the French government had to repeatedly express hesitation when negotiating and concluding this treaty. Until the last minute before the formal signing of this so-called "European Defense Community Treaty," the French government specifically requested the United States and Britain to provide so-called "guarantees" to prevent West Germany from reneging on its obligations under the "European Defense Community." Only after the United States and Britain agreed to issue a hypocritical and empty statement with it, did it sign the treaty. The Paris "Le Monde" editorial on May 27th admitted that the French government's request for such "guarantees" from the United States and British governments was only to calm the agitated public opinion.

Due to the irreconcilable contradictions between the United States, British, and French imperialist blocs and the European people, as well as among themselves, the emergence of the so-called "European Defense Community Treaty" was delayed for a very long time. The negotiations between France, Italy, and other five countries and the West German puppet government continued for fifteen months from February last year, and finally, under the pressure of the United States, an agreement was barely reached on May 23 this year. Now that the treaty has been signed, its implementation is still a big question. The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Paris on May 9th, admitted: "After the formal signing of the agreement, the European Army plan still has to overcome many serious difficulties." The Associated Press is primarily concerned about whether the parliaments of France, Italy, and the other five countries and West Germany can quickly ratify this treaty under the strong opposition of the people of their countries. It said: "It is expected that many difficulties will be encountered in West Germany and France,... There are many people in France who oppose arming any Germans." The Associated Press also believes that it will take many years for the parliaments of various countries to approve the "European Defense Community" agreement. It said: "Speaking of the time required to ratify the agreement, the Schuman Coal and Steel Community plan can be taken as an example. This plan was also signed by these five countries and West Germany nearly thirteen months ago, but so far the Netherlands and Italy have not completed the ratification work, and the parliaments of Belgium and Luxembourg have not even discussed the ratification of this plan." Now, United Press International's dispatch from Paris on the 27th is also worried: "It is generally expected that there will be great controversy when the European Army Treaty is ratified,... As for whether it can be ratified, there is currently no certainty at all."

### “欧洲集团”条约在巴黎签字  美联社供认将遭到许多严重困难

    “欧洲集团”条约在巴黎签字
    美联社供认将遭到许多严重困难
    【新华社二十九日讯】法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡五国及西德傀儡政府间谈判了很久的所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约，已于五月二十七日在巴黎正式签字。这是继美、英、法三国与西德傀儡政府于二十六日在波恩签订所谓“一般性条约”以后，帝国主义集团在欧洲又一阴险的备战步骤。
    这个为期五十年的条约，是美国制造出来准备侵略战争的工具，其主要目的就是要重新武装西德。所谓“欧洲防务集团”系由上述五国与西德组成。它将成为北大西洋侵略集团的一个组成部分，并将在北大西洋军司令部指挥之下建立“欧洲军”，其中包括纳粹军队十二师。这样，欧洲最富侵略性的德国军国主义者，就得以明目张胆地参加北大西洋战争联盟，而且成为美国的主要仆从。
    这个条约同时又是美国进一步奴役西欧各国的工具。它明白而具体地规定：“欧洲集团”要从美国直接控制下的“北大西洋公约组织”接受各种指示，实际领导“欧洲军”的一个委员会必须“在和北大西洋公约组织商议以后”才能作出决定，在战时“欧洲军”即直接归北大西洋侵略军司令部指挥。这样，就不但是西德，而且连法国、意大利、荷兰、比利时和卢森堡也都一样要向美国交出它们指挥自己军队的权利，也就是交出了它们最重要的国防主权。
    正是由于“欧洲防务集团”的这种性质，美国所制造的这个阴谋一开始就受到西欧广大人民的猛烈反对，并且引起了西欧各国统治集团的疑惧。首先是在法国，法国人民了解：美、英、法三国和西德傀儡政府缔结的“一般性条约”和把西德拖入北大西洋集团的“欧洲集团条约”，削弱了法国的地位，使法国面临正在被恢复起来的西德军国主义的威胁。在法国人民强大的反对面前，法国政府在谈判缔结这个条约时也不得不一再表示犹豫。直到这个所谓“欧洲防务集团条约”正式签字前的最后一分钟，法国政府还特别要求美国和英国提供所谓防止西德背弃它在“欧洲集团”中所承担的义务的“保证”，在美、英两国同意与它共同发了一个虚伪而空洞的声明以后，才算签了字。巴黎“世界报”五月二十七日社论承认：法国政府向美国和英国政府要求这种“保证”的目的，只是在于安定激愤的舆论。
    由于美、英、法帝国主义集团与欧洲人民间以及它们相互间存在着无法解决的矛盾，所谓“欧洲防务集团条约”的产生，拖延了极长的时间。法、意等五国与西德傀儡政府间的谈判，从去年二月起一直继续了十五个月，最后在美国的高压之下，才在今年五月二十三日勉强达成了协议。现在条约虽已签字，但是实现却还是一个很大的问题。美联社在五月九日从巴黎发出的电讯中承认：“在正式签订协定以后，欧洲军计划仍然必须克服许多严重的困难。”美联社首先担心的是在各国人民强烈反对下法、意等五国及西德议会能否迅速批准这个条约的问题，它说：“预料在西德和法国要遭遇到很多困难，……法国有许多人反对武装任何德国人。”美联社并且认为要使各国议会批准“欧洲集团”协定还需要漫长的岁月，它说：“谈到批准协定所需要的时间，可以舒曼煤钢联营计划为例，这个计划是在将近十三个月以前也是由这五国和西德签订的，可是到现在荷兰和意大利还没有完成批准的工作，而且比利时和卢森堡议会还根本没有讨论批准这个计划的问题。”现在，合众社二十七日从巴黎发出的电讯中也在担忧：“一般预料，欧洲军条约在批准时将有大争论，……至于是否能够批准，目前完全没有把握。”
