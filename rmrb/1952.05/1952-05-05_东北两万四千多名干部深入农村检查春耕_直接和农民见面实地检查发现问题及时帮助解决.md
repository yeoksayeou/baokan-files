More Than 24,000 Cadres in Northeast China Go Deep into Rural Areas to Inspect Spring Plowing
Meet Directly with Farmers, Conduct On-the-Spot Inspections, Discover Problems, and Help Solve Them in a Timely Manner
Recently, the CPC committees and people's governments at all levels in Northeast China have successively dispatched more than 24,000 cadres to go deep into the rural areas to inspect spring plowing. They have promptly discovered and solved many practical problems in spring agricultural production, which has played a significant role in promoting timely sowing and launching the patriotic production increase competition.

This large-scale spring plowing inspection was personally led by Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, and Lin Feng, Vice Chairman. From the beginning of April, in addition to instructing and urging responsible cadres at all levels to personally conduct in-depth inspections of spring plowing work, Gao Gang set an example by personally going to the countryside twice to inspect the spring plowing situation. Lin Feng also went to Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province, during this period to inspect spring plowing. As a result, a large-scale inspection work, from top to bottom, layer by layer, quickly unfolded. Inspection teams led by Wang Guangwei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Northeast People's Government, Du Zaiheng, Minister of Agriculture, Wang Yifu, Minister of Civil Affairs, and Yan Guhang, Director of the Northeast Cooperative Enterprise Management Committee, successively went to Jilin, Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, Liaodong and other provinces to conduct key inspections. Each province was led by the main responsible cadres of the CPC Provincial Committee and the Provincial People's Government, who personally led a large number of cadres to various counties for inspection. The leading organs of the Party and government in each county also put most of their cadres into this work. In Liaoxi Province alone, more than 7,000 cadres were sent to villages and hamlets to lead spring plowing.

During this major inspection, responsible cadres of the Party and government at all levels went deep into the villages and hamlets, met directly with farmers, and conducted on-the-spot inspections of spring plowing preparations such as fertilizers, seeds, and farm tools, thereby discovering problems and solving them. When Du Zaiheng, Minister of Agriculture of the Northeast People's Government, was inspecting in Liangshan Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, after listening to the village cadres' report on the preparation for farming, he inspected the village's manure accumulation with them. As a result, he discovered the methods by which some farmers increased manure fertilizer and corrected the negative thinking of some cadres and farmers who believed that "there is no source of manure, so manure fertilizer cannot be increased." The cadres sent by Shulan County to various villages to lead spring plowing discovered that some farmers whose crops had failed last year lacked food and their enthusiasm for production was low. Therefore, they convened a forum of local farmers with surplus grain and mobilized them to lend the surplus grain to households in difficulty at reasonable interest rates to help them solve the difficulties in production.

Through this inspection, all localities have further implemented various production policies and encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production. For example, when Gao Gang arrived in Fushun County, Liaodong Province, to inspect spring plowing, the district and village cadres of the county raised many questions to him. After he answered them one by one, the district and village cadres further improved their ideological understanding and strengthened their confidence in increasing production. They unanimously assured him that they would increase the yield per mu by 20 jin of grain this year. The cadres sent by the leading organs of Yingkou County, Liaodong Province, to various villages to lead spring plowing repeatedly explained the production increase policy for this year to the farmers, helped the farmers formulate production increase plans, and mobilized the farmers to launch a production increase competition. In addition, through this major inspection, many practical problems in spring agricultural production have been discovered and solved in various places, and the spontaneous phenomenon of spring plowing leadership in various places has been basically reversed, so that spring wheat sowing could be completed in a timely manner, and the sowing of autumn crops was advanced by ten days to half a month compared with previous years.

    东北两万四千多名干部深入农村检查春耕
    直接和农民见面实地检查发现问题及时帮助解决
    最近东北各级中共党委和人民政府，先后派出了二万四千多名干部深入农村检查春耕，及时发现和解决了春耕生产中的许多实际问题，对推动各地适时播种和开展爱国增产竞赛运动起了很大作用。
    这次大规模的春耕检查，是由东北人民政府主席高岗和副主席林枫亲自领导的。从四月初起，高岗除了指示和督促各级负责干部要亲自深入检查春耕工作外，以身作则，先后两次赴农村视察春耕的情形。林枫也在这一期间赴辽东省辽阳县检查春耕。于是，一个自上而下的层层深入的大规模检查工作便很快地展开了。由东北人民政府副秘书长王光伟、农业部部长杜者蘅、民政部部长王一夫、东北合作事业管理委员会主任委员阎顾行等率领的检查组，相继到吉林、黑龙江、辽西、辽东等省有重点地进行了检查。各省就由中共省委员会和省人民政府的主要负责干部，亲自率领大批干部分赴各县进行检查。各县党、政领导机关，也把大部干部投入这一工作。仅辽西省各县派至村、屯领导春耕的干部就达七千多人。
    在这次大检查中，各级党、政负责干部都作到了深入村屯，直接和农民见面，实地检查肥料、种籽、农具等各项春耕准备工作，从而发现了问题，解决了问题。东北人民政府农业部部长杜者蘅在吉林省舒兰县亮山村进行检查时，听取了村干部关于备耕工作的汇报后，就和他们一起检查该村积粪的情况，因而发现了部分农民增加粪肥的办法，纠正了某些干部和农民认为“没有粪源，不能增加粪肥”的消极思想。舒兰县派至各村领导春耕的干部，发现去年一部分庄稼歉收的农户缺乏食粮，生产情绪低落，于是他们便召集当地有余粮的农户开座谈会，动员他们把余粮以合理的利息贷给困难户，帮助他们解决了生产中的困难。
    各地通过这次检查，都进一步贯彻了各项生产政策，鼓舞了农民的增产热情。如高岗到达辽东省抚顺县视察春耕时，该县区、村干部向他提出了许多问题，经他一一解答后，区、村干部都进一步提高了思想认识，增强了增产信心，一致向他保证今年每亩地要增产二十斤粮食。辽东省营口县领导机关派至各村领导春耕的干部，反复地向农民交代了今年的增产方针，帮助农民制订了增产计划，发动农民展开了增产竞赛。此外，经过这次大检查，各地还发现和解决了春耕生产中的许多实际问题，基本上扭转了各地对于春耕领导的自流现象，因而使各地得以适时完成春麦播种，使秋作物的播种比往年提前了十天到半个月。  （新华社）
