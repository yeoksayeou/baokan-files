Making Products Excellent While Saving Labor and Materials
    ——An Interview with Industrial Model Worker Liu Lifu

    Liu Lifu is a young forging worker and an excellent Communist Party member from a factory in Lüda City. The production group he leads is a shining example for workers in Lüda City. As early as the end of 1950, they were the first to win the "Product Exemption from Inspection Right" because they produced 100% high-quality products throughout the year. Last April, the entire group also received commendation from Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government and a circular of commendation from the Lüda City Committee of the Communist Youth League. This time, he was honorably invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to come to the capital to participate in the "May Day" Labor Day celebration.

    On April 28th, I interviewed this advanced producer. He happily told me that in the past few years, his group has made considerable progress under the cultivation of the Communist Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League. Since the beginning of this year, all the workers in the group have participated in the "Three-Anti" campaign, and their class consciousness has been further enhanced than before. When the "Three-Anti" campaign began, many workers in the group said, "Our group has not produced any defective products since 1950. Is there still waste? The 'Three-Anti' campaign has little to do with us." Later, after Liu Lifu patiently explained to all the workers in the group the harm of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the country and the people, everyone's thinking gradually became clear. Sun Changyou, the group's "fire-burning king," used to be a person who only knew how to burn the fire and did not care about politics. In the "Three-Anti" campaign, he also changed, not only becoming more energetic in production but also daring to fight against corruption and waste.

    Then, Comrade Liu Lifu emphatically told me that all the workers in his group, in order to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" campaign and to save more wealth for the country, have realized the slogan of "everyone using their brains." Not long ago, they accepted the task of making 1,700 "connecting plate clips." The raw material was two tons of iron plates, all large pieces; the plan was to complete it within 1,700 hours. After Liu Lifu received this task, he thought: there are many difficulties in doing this batch of work: one is that the raw materials are not enough; the second is that if this material is used, it must first be cut in the riveter's room before it can be taken to the forging room to do. These procedures alone will take up 800 hours; the remaining 900 hours are not enough. What to do? He found the workers in the group to discuss together. After everyone pondered, they all proposed: "It can be done by using the small waste materials in the factory." The leadership agreed to their suggestion. Later, they also developed a "central tire" (a kind of tool) and improved the pliers. As a result, it took only 831 hours to make 1,700 "connecting plate clips," saving 869 working hours compared to the stipulated time, and only used more than 2,500 kilograms of waste.

    From January to now, in addition to the big jobs, all the whole batches of parts of Liu Lifu's group, such as screws and gear wheels, are completed by using the discarded material heads and old iron thrown in the factory. In less than a month, all the workers in the group saved the country more than 30 tons of iron and fuel.

    In order to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day, on April 10th, all the workers in their group initiated a friendship competition to the workers of the whole factory and the production groups of various factories in Lüda City. By April 24th, Liu Lifu's group had completed the production quota for the first quarter of 1955. Liu Lifu said, "We are not proud of this, we are working hard to strive for greater achievements!"

　　做的产品呱呱叫，还要省工又省料
    ——访问工业劳动模范刘立富
    刘立富，是旅大市某工厂一个青年锻工，优秀的共产党员。他领导的生产小组，在旅大市职工中是一面鲜明的旗帜。早在一九五零年底，他们因为全年生产了百分之百的优等产品，第一个荣获了“产品免检权”。去年四月，全组又得到了东北人民政府高岗主席的嘉勉和青年团旅大市委员会的通报表扬。这次，他光荣地受到全国总工会的邀请，到首都来参加“五一”劳动节庆祝典礼。
    四月二十八日，我访问了这位先进的生产者。他愉快地告诉我：这几年来，他这个小组，在共产党、行政、工会、青年团的培养下，有了不少进步。今年年初以来，全组职工参加了“三反”运动，阶级觉悟比以前更提高了。当“三反”运动开始的时候，组内好多工友还说：“我们这个组，从一九五零年开始就没出过废品，还有浪费吗？‘三反’和我们关系不多。”后来经过刘立富耐心地向全组职工说明贪污、浪费、官僚主义对国家人民的危害，大家的思想便慢慢搞通了。组里的“烧火大王”孙长有，原是一个只知埋头烧火，不关心政治的人。在“三反”运动中，他也变了，不但生产更加有劲，而且能大胆地和贪污、浪费现象斗争。
    接着，刘立富同志着重地告诉我：他们全小组的职工，为了巩固“三反”的成果，为了给国家节约更多的财富，已经实现了“个个人动脑筋”的口号。不久以前，他们接受做“联接板卡子”一千七百个的任务。原料是两吨铁板，都是大块的；计划是一千七百小时内完成。刘立富接到这个任务后，便想：做这批活困难不少：一是原料不够；二是如果用这料，必须先到铆工间剪料，然后才可拿到锻工间做。光这些手续，就要占去八百小时；剩下的九百个小时，怎么也不够用。怎么办呢？他便找组里的职工一起商量。经大家一琢磨，都提出：“利用厂内的小废料就可以做。”领导方面同意了他们的建议。后来，他们又研究出一个“中心胎”（一种工具），并且改进了钳子。结果，做成一千七百个“联接板卡子”，只化去八百三十一小时，较规定的时间节约了八百六十九个工时，而且只用了二千五百多公斤废料。
    从今年一月到现在，刘立富小组除了大活外，所有的整批零件，如螺丝、牙轮等，都是利用已成废物的料头和扔在厂内的旧铁完成的。在不到一个月的时间里，全组工人就为国家节约了三十多吨铁料和燃料。
    为了迎接“五一”劳动节，在四月十日那天他们全组职工向全厂职工和旅大市各工厂生产小组发起友谊竞赛。到四月二十四日，刘立富小组已完成了一九五五年第一季的生产定额。刘立富说：“我们并没有因此而骄傲，我们正为争取更大的成绩而努力！”
