Learning the Soviet Double-Handed Mud Extrusion Bricklaying Method

Su Changyou Group Sets New National Bricklaying Record

Ma Wenzhi Group of Northeast Fuxin Mining Bureau Sets New National Drilling Record

The Su Changyou bricklaying group studied the Soviet Shavlyugin double-handed mud extrusion bricklaying method, which greatly improved work efficiency. Using this method, each person can lay an average of 6,000 bricks per day, which is two times more efficient than the segmented continuous bricklaying method, and nearly two times more efficient than the Tianjin Fu Hongbin group. This is the latest national bricklaying record.

The double-handed mud extrusion bricklaying method is a further improvement on Su Changyou's segmented continuous bricklaying method. After implementing the double-handed mud extrusion method, in addition to adding personnel, accelerating operations, and replacing the front brick placement with back brick delivery without using a large trowel, the entire process is basically the same as the segmented bricklaying method. When implementing the double-handed mud extrusion bricklaying method, the Su Changyou group consisted of a first- or second-class bricklayer leading a third-class bricklayer and three apprentices (one more apprentice than before) to form a bricklaying group dedicated to laying a section of the project. When operations begin, an apprentice first spreads mortar with a mortar spreader in front, and the first- or second-class bricklayer is responsible for hanging the line and laying the outer skin. He and the third-class bricklayer laying the inner skin proceed simultaneously. Behind them is another apprentice dedicated to delivering bricks, and the last apprentice follows with filling the core and grouting. Before the start of each section of the project, scaffolding workers first tie the scaffolding on both sides of the wall, and the transportation group also prepares for tasks such as sifting sand, carrying mortar, transporting bricks, and carrying water. When the bricklayers start working, the scaffolding workers and transportation workers move on to the next section of the project. In this way, a segmented continuous cyclical operation is formed throughout the entire project. The Su Changyou group further improved labor organization by implementing this method. At the same time, they improved the mortar spreader based on the mortar spreading tool of the Fu Hongbin bricklaying group. The bricklayers also changed the past single-handed work method of holding a brick in one hand and a large trowel in the other, which greatly accelerated the work speed, created a higher work efficiency than before, and still maintained the advantages of the segmented continuous bricklaying method.

After the Ma Wenzhi drilling group of the Northeast Fuxin Mining Bureau issued a friendly challenge to the drilling groups in the Northeast, it set a new national drilling record. The Ma Wenzhi group further leveraged collective wisdom and made many improvements in technical operations. They found ways to shorten the rod tamping time and further studied the method of using yellow mud slurry and taking rock cores with iron sand without stopping drilling. From the start of drilling on May 2nd to 11:00 AM on May 6th, in just four days and eleven hours (some time was delayed due to underground water leakage), they created a new record of drilling 100 meters, exceeding the quota set by the Northeast Industrial Department Coal Mine Administration by more than double. On May 4th, the drilling efficiency reached 31.87 meters, exceeding their previous highest daily progress record by 11.7%. (Shi Yun)

    学习苏联双手挤浆砌砖法
    苏长有小组创全国砌砖最新纪录
    东北阜新矿务局马文志小组再创全国最高钻进纪录
    苏长有瓦工小组学习苏联沙夫留金双手挤浆砌砖法，使工作效率得到更大的提高。运用这种方法砌砖，每天每人平均可砌六千块，较分段连续砌砖法的工作效率提高两倍，也比天津傅鸿宾小组的工作效率提高将近两倍。这是全国砌砖的最新纪录。
    双手挤浆砌砖法是苏长有分段连续砌砖法的进一步提高。实行双手挤浆法后，除了增添人员，加速操作，不用大铲，把前面摆砖改为后面递砖外，整个工序基本上与分段砌砖法相同。实行双手挤浆砌砖法时，苏长有小组是由一个一等或二等瓦工领导一个三等瓦工和三个学徒工（学徒比原来增加了一人），组成一砌砖小组，专砌一段工程。操作开始，首先由一徒工用铺灰器在前面铺灰，一等或二等瓦工负责挂线和砌外皮，他和砌里皮的三等瓦工同时并进，他们的后面是另一徒工专门给递砖，最后一名徒工则随着填心、灌浆。在每段工程开始以前，由架子工先绑好墙两面的架子，运输小组也把筛砂、挑灰、运砖、挑水等工作做好。瓦工开始工作时，架子工和运输工就转到下一段工程去工作。如此，在整个工程中便形成分段连续循环操作。苏长有小组由于实行这一方法进一步改进了劳动组织，同时他们根据傅鸿宾瓦工小组的铺灰工具改造了铺灰器，瓦工砌砖时又改变了过去一手拿砖一手拿大铲的单手干活法，使工作速度大大加快，创造了比以前更高的工作效率，并仍然保持了分段连续砌砖法的优点。　（新华社）
    东北阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组，向东北各钻探小组提出友谊挑战后，又创全国最高钻进纪录。马文志小组进一步发挥了集体的智慧，在技术操作上，又作了很多改进。他们设法缩短了捣杆时间，进一步研究了使用黄泥浆和取岩芯下铁砂而不停止钻进的办法。从五月二日开始钻进到五月六日上午十一时止，只四天十一小时的时间（中间因地下漏水，还耽误了一些时间），就创造了钻进一百公尺的最新纪录，超过东北工业部煤矿管理局定额的一倍以上。在五月四日，钻进效率曾达三一·八七公尺，超过他们过去最高日进纪录百分之十一点七。（石耘）
