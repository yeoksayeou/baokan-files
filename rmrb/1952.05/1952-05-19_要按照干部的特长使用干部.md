    Use Cadres According to Their Strengths
    Dong Zhenyu
    In the Soviet Union, if several trucks are not fully utilized, it would be criticized as wasting state property. This is true for all tools and machinery. People, who use the tools, are of course even more important. However, in our country, the situation of "being employed in a field other than one's expertise" still exists to a considerable extent in some units. The irrational use of personnel is not as obvious as idle machinery. When a technical person is assigned to a non-technical job, it may seem that their position is "suitable" due to their efforts. But with the large-scale economic construction of the country about to begin and a great shortage of technical personnel, this situation should be changed.
    The situation of "being employed in a field other than one's expertise" was very common in the old society. Students faced "unemployment upon graduation." Those who found jobs through "connections" were often "employed in fields other than their expertise." After liberation, the phenomenon of "unemployment upon graduation" disappeared forever. The situation of "being employed in a field other than one's expertise" has also been greatly reduced, but this phenomenon has not been eliminated.
    The general situation of "being employed in a field other than one's expertise" is as follows: technical personnel urgently needed in place A are being inappropriately used in place B, which does not need such personnel; personnel needed in place B are being inappropriately used in place A or place C. Such situations still persist in some units. The reasons for this situation are: first, cadres' situations were not thoroughly investigated during allocation, leading to inappropriate assignments. Second, some institutions need certain cadres in future plans, so they reserve a portion of cadres in advance, who are currently idle. Third, some institutions lack certain cadres, so they pull in existing cadres of other types as replacements. Some units also insist on retaining cadres they don't need, because these cadres have "higher education levels" and are "reliable in their work," etc.
    From the cadres' own perspective, some students who have just left school have only learned some book knowledge and are inevitably apprehensive about actual work. Therefore, if the work is not suitable, they dare not raise objections and gradually become content with their current occupation. Some people have raised objections, but leading cadres often say: "Don't emphasize personal interests," "This is a purely technical viewpoint," "You are more important here than elsewhere," "The revolution needs you there, so you should be there," "Everything should be subordinate to the organization." These words are correct. However, for technical personnel who are not being rationally used, it is not appropriate to only emphasize general organizational principles in a sweeping manner without considering the specific circumstances and the current needs of the country. That will cause intangible but serious losses to the revolutionary cause.
    Therefore, after the "Three-Anti" movement, when establishing systems and improving organizations, this irrational phenomenon should be eliminated as soon as possible. I suggest that relevant central departments strengthen their work in this area and truly achieve "making the best use of everyone's talents." In this way, all aspects of our country's construction will move forward at a higher speed.

    要按照干部的特长使用干部
    董振玉
    在苏联，几部卡车若不被充分利用，就会被指责为浪费了国家的财产。一切工具和机械都是这样。人，是使用工具的，当然就更重要了。但是，在我国，“所用非所学”的情形，目前在某些单位中还相当严重地存在着。人不被合理地使用，不像机器被闲置起来那样显眼。技术人员担任非技术工作，由于他的努力，看来他的工作岗位也还“合适”。但在国家大规模经济建设即将开始、技术人员非常缺乏的情况下，这种情况是应当改变的。
    “所用非所学”的情况，在旧社会是非常普遍的。学生“毕业即失业”。有人借“门路”找到职业，也多是“用非所学”。解放以后，“毕业即失业”的现象是一去不复返了。“用非所学”的情形也大大减少了，但这种现象并未消灭。
    “所用非所学”的大体情形是这样：甲处所急需的技术人员，在不需此种人员的乙处被不恰当地使用着；乙处所需人员，又在甲处或丙处被不恰当地使用着。这样的情况现在仍然残存在某些单位。这种情况存在的原因是：一、分配干部时没有把干部的情况考查清楚，以致分配不当。二、某一机构在将来的计划中需要某种干部，因而预先掌握一部分干部，现在闲着没用。三、有的机构缺乏某种干部，就把现有的别种干部拉来代替。还有的单位本来用不着这种干部而硬要留下，原因是这些干部“文化水平较高”，“办事踏实”等。
    在干部本身来说，有一些才出校门的学生，只学了一些书本知识，一想到实际工作，不免心虚，所以工作不合适，也不敢提意见，渐渐地也就安于他业了。有些人也曾提出意见，但领导干部常常说：“不要强调个人兴趣”，“这是纯技术观点”，“你在这里比别处更为重要”，“革命要你在那里，你就应该在那里”，“一切应该服从组织”。这些话都是正确的。但是，对于没有被合理使用的技术人员，不根据具体情况，不根据国家当前的需要来加以考虑，光是笼统地强调一般的组织原则，那是不够妥当的。那会给革命事业造成无形的但是严重的损失。
    所以，在“三反”运动以后，在建立制度、健全组织的时候，应该尽可能早日消除这种不合理的现象。我建议中央有关部门加强这方面的工作，真正作到“人尽其才”。这样，我们国家的各方面建设，就会以更高的速度向前迈进。
