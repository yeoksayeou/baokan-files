Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 7th: TASS reports: The Soviet Council of Ministers has issued an order to issue 30 billion rubles of national bonds for 1952. The issuance of national bonds is to absorb the people's financial resources, further develop the national economy, and build the Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka hydropower stations, the Turkmen Main Canal, and the South Ukraine and North Crimean Canals. The principal of the bonds will be repaid in installments over 20 years, and subscription will begin on May 6th. Bond tickets and winning bonuses are exempt from national, local, and other taxes.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 6th: TASS reports: Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev recently published an article on the Soviet Union's issuance of national bonds for the development of the national economy in 1952, saying: This year's bond issuance work, like in previous years, will form a great political upsurge. Workers, peasants, and government employees all consider buying bonds their civic duty, because they know that this strength they contribute to the country will be used to promote the socialist economy and culture, and to realize Stalin's communist construction plan. These forces will promote the expansion of industrial and agricultural production, develop transportation, develop science and culture, and improve the people's living standards. All sectors of the Soviet socialist economy and culture have achieved great development. In 1951, the output of socialist industry had reached more than twice the pre-war level and continues to develop rapidly. In the first quarter of this year, the total output of Soviet industry increased by 16 percent compared with the first quarter of last year, and labor productivity increased by 10 percent during the same period. Socialist agriculture also made many achievements in 1951. At the construction sites of various great communist construction projects, this year's construction work is becoming larger and larger in scale. The construction workload of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station will more than double compared with last year, the work of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station will increase by one and a half times, and the work of the South Ukraine Canal and the North Crimean Canal will increase by two and a half times. A characteristic of socialist economic development is the rapid increase in national income, and in the Soviet Union, these incomes all belong to the working people.

Zverev said: The figures in the 1952 Soviet state budget reflect the plan to further develop socialist industry, agriculture, and transportation, develop trade, and further improve the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. The vast majority of the funds in this budget are earmarked for the development of the national economy and for social and cultural facilities. Of the total budget, 180.4 billion rubles are earmarked for the development of the national economy, accounting for 37.8 percent of the total. Expenditures for social and cultural undertakings total 124.8 billion rubles, accounting for 26.2 percent of the entire budget expenditure, an increase of 5.9 billion rubles over last year. More than 80 percent of the income in the Soviet state budget comes from the socialist economy. The issuance of national bonds is another important source of budget revenue. In the 30 years that national bonds have been issued in the Soviet Union, the scope of bond issuance has been very broad and occupies an important position in the Soviet economic and political life. Tens of millions of Soviet citizens hold national bonds. The amount of bond subscriptions always exceeds the determined issuance amount. Last year's national bond was 30 billion rubles, while the amount subscribed was 34.8 billion rubles. This year, the income of the working people has increased, and there is no doubt that the issuance of bonds will be as successful as last year. Soviet bonds are another source of funds to make up for socialist state expenditures, but at the same time, they can also enable bond subscribers to obtain a large income. In the post-war period, approximately 22 billion rubles have been paid to the people in the form of bonuses, of which 5 billion rubles were paid in 1951. In 1952, the amount paid to the people will be even larger—7 billion rubles.

Zverev emphasized: Soviet bonds are fundamentally different from the bonds of capitalist countries. Capitalist countries issue bonds to make up for their budget deficits, and their budgets are for preparing new wars of aggression. The excessive issuance of bonds by capitalist countries has become a source of wealth for the exploiting classes, making the people's taxes heavier and making the working people more painful and poor.

Zverev finally said: Soviet bonds are one of the sources of funds for the development of the economy and culture. The issuance of bonds is a major economic and political task of the Soviet state. Whether the issuance can be successful depends on mass explanatory work and on skillfully organizing the subscription work in individual enterprises, institutions, and collective farms. The successful issuance of new bonds will further strengthen the economic strength of the Soviet state and help further improve the living standards of the Soviet people.

    吸收人民的财力进一步发展国民经济
    苏联发行国家公债三百亿卢布
    苏联财政部长兹维列夫著文论述发行国家公债的意义
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：苏联部长会议颁布了关于发行一九五二年国家公债三百亿卢布的命令。发行公债是为了吸收人民的财力，进一步发展国民经济，建造古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和卡霍夫卡水电站，土库曼大运河、南乌克兰和北克里米亚运河。公债在二十年中分期还本，从五月六日起开始认购。公债票和中签奖金免征国税、地方税及其他捐税。
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联财政部长兹维列夫顷就苏联发行一九五二年发展国民经济国家公债事发表文章说：今年的公债发行工作，亦将和往年一样，将要形成一个伟大的政治热潮。工人、农民和机关工作者都认为购买公债是他们的公民职责，因为他们知道，他们贡献给国家的这份力量将要用来促进社会主义的经济和文化，用来实现斯大林的共产主义建设计划。这些力量将促进工农业生产的扩大，发展交通，发展科学和文化，提高人民的生活水准。苏联社会主义经济和文化的各部门取得了伟大的发展。一九五一年，社会主义工业的产量已经达到战前水平的两倍多，并在继续迅速地发展着。今年第一季，苏联工业总产量比去年第一季增加了百分之十六，劳动生产率在同一时期提高了百分之十。社会主义的农业在一九五一年也取得了很多成就。在各个伟大的共产主义建设工程工地，今年的建设工作规模愈来愈大。古比雪夫水力发电站的建设工作量将比去年增加一倍多，斯大林格勒水力发电站的工作将增加一倍半，南乌克兰运河和北克里米亚运河的工作将增加两倍半。社会主义经济发展的特色就是国民经济收入的迅速增加，在苏联，这些收入全都是属于劳动人民的。
    兹维列夫说：一九五二年度苏联国家预算中的数字反映出了进一步发展社会主义的工业、农业和运输业，发展贸易并进一步提高苏联人民物质和文化生活水平的计划。这个预算中的款项，绝大部分都是规定用于发展国民经济和用于社会及文化设施。预算总额中，规定用来发展国民经济的有一千八百零四亿卢布，占总额百分之三十七点八。用于社会和文化事业的开支共达一千二百四十八亿卢布，占整个预算开支的百分之二十六点二，比去年增加了五十九亿卢布。苏联国家预算中的收入，百分之八十以上来自社会主义经济。发行国家公债也是预算收入的另一个重要来源。在苏联发行国家公债的三十年内，公债发行范围很广泛，并在苏联的经济生活和政治生活中占重要地位。几千万苏联公民都握有国家公债券。认购公债的数额总是超过所确定的发行数额。去年的国家公债为三百亿卢布，而认购的数额却为三百四十八亿卢布。今年，劳动人民的收入增加了，毫无疑问，公债的发行将和去年一样成功。苏联公债是弥补社会主义国家支出的另一个来源，但它同时又可使认购公债的人获得很大的收入。在战后时期中，以奖金形式向人民付出的款项约有二百二十亿卢布，其中在一九五一年付出的有五十亿卢布。在一九五二年，向人民付出的款项还要大——七十亿卢布。
    兹维列夫着重指出：苏联公债与资本主义国家的公债有根本上的区别，资本主义国家发行公债是为了弥补它们的预算赤字，而它们的预算是为了准备新的侵略战争的。资本主义国家滥发公债，这已成为剥削阶级致富的一个源泉，使人民的赋税更加繁重，并使劳动人民更加痛苦和贫穷。
    兹维列夫最后说：苏联的公债是发展经济与文化的经费来源之一。公债的发行，是苏维埃国家的一项重大的经济和政治工作。发行是否能获成功，有赖于群众性的解释工作，有赖于熟练地组织各别企业、机关、集体农场中的认购工作。新公债的顺利发行，将进一步加强苏维埃国家的经济力量，有助于苏联人民的生活水准的进一步提高。
