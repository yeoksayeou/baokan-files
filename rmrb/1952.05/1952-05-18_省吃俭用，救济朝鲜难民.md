Saving and Thrifting to Aid Korean Refugees
\tPolitical Education Section of a certain Volunteer Army Division, Li Yongxiang

The heinous American aggressors have destroyed many beloved homes of the Korean people, leaving them displaced and living in hardship. Commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Chinese Communist Party's Volunteer Army Committee to launch a movement to save food and aid Korean refugees. A certain unit, starting in January of this year, implemented a policy of "each person in the company saving five qian of grain per day, and each person in the headquarters saving one liang of grain per day." The slogan posted in the unit's mess hall was: "Cherish the Korean people as if they were our own parents and siblings." The cooks carefully prepared meals and washed rice, ensuring that not a single grain was wasted. Soldiers took their meals back to the barracks, and any leftovers were carefully preserved and returned to the mess hall. As a result of everyone's savings, the entire division saved a large quantity of rice and sorghum in January. This batch of grain was distributed to the poor people of the garrison area in early February. Before the distribution, the unit worked with the local Korean People's Government to investigate the people in need of assistance. On the day of the distribution, mass meetings were held in each ri (equivalent to our country's township), and the people who attended were deeply moved, expressing their determination to respond to the Volunteer Army's high degree of internationalist friendship by producing well and supporting the war effort. Old woman Cui Daozhong held the grain in her hands, tears streaming down her face, and said: "The American devils and Syngman Rhee are not letting us live; you are risking your lives to rescue us and are even saving and thrifting to help us. We will never forget you."

    省吃俭用，救济朝鲜难民
    志愿军某师宣教科　李永祥
    万恶的美国侵略军毁坏了朝鲜人民许多可爱的家园，使他们流离失所，生活很困难。中国人民志愿军的指战员热烈响应中共志愿军党委的号召，开展了节约粮食来救济朝鲜难民的运动。某部从今年一月份起，就实行“连队每人每日节约粮食五钱，机关每人每天节约粮食一两”。部队的伙食房里贴的标语是：“爱护朝鲜人民，像爱护我们的父母兄弟一样”。炊事员们细心地做饭、淘米，一粒米也不让浪费。战士们打了饭到营房去吃，剩下的一定要保存好，送回伙房。大家这样节约的结果，全师在一月份就省下了大批的大米和高粱米。这批粮食在二月初旬发给了驻地的贫苦人民。发放之前，部队协同当地朝鲜人民政府调查了需要救济的对象。发放的那天，各里（相当于我国的乡）召开了群众大会，到会的群众都深受感动，纷纷表示一定要用好好生产、努力支援战争来回答志愿军的这种高度的国际主义友情。崔道中老大娘两手抱着粮食，流着眼泪说：“美国鬼子和李承晚不让我们活；你们拚着命来打救我们，还省吃俭用来救济我们。我们永远不会忘记你们。”
