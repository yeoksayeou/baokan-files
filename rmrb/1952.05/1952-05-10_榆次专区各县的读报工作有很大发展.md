    The Reading Newspaper Work of Counties in Yuci Area Has Great Development
    Editor: Since the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a reading newspaper work conference last November, the people's reading newspaper work in the counties of Yuci area, Shanxi Province, has greatly developed. Before August of last year, there were a total of 4,265 reading newspaper groups in the entire area; by the beginning of February this year, the nine counties of Jiexiu, Zuoquan, Xugou, Jiaocheng, Fenyang, Lingshi, Qixian, Taigu, and Heshun alone had developed to 20,524 groups.
    Reading newspaper groups have powerfully promoted the development of various tasks. For example, after the reading newspaper group members in Houzhuang Village, Xiyang County, read Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, they immediately discussed the issue of increasing production and practicing economy based on the actual conditions of their village. They specifically calculated the village's total expenditure last year, and found that 299 dan of grain were wasted on activities such as opera performances and weddings and funerals, while the total increase in grain production for the year was only 150 dan. This calculation shocked the masses. Everyone decided to reduce unnecessary expenses this year. The whole village estimates that it can save 169 dan of grain, which, added to the increased production of 150 dan, actually increases the income by 319 dan of grain. This amount of grain is enough for the entire village to eat for four months, or to buy 70 head of draught animals. This method of conducting discussions in conjunction with actual living conditions educated the broad masses of peasants, and a movement to increase production and practice economy quickly unfolded in the whole village. Reading newspaper groups in Yushe, Fenyang and other counties, after reading Comrade Gao Gang's article "On the Direction of Rural Economic Development," launched discussions in connection with their own thoughts and the actual situation of mutual aid and cooperation, resolving many people's confused ideas. Due to clarifying the direction of rural economic development in the discussions, the mutual aid groups in Tianjiatun Village, Fenyang, have seen great development.
    After the reading newspaper work was carried out, the political atmosphere in the countryside became stronger. In the past, places where people used to gossip and tell old stories have now become places to discuss important national affairs. Many people who never cared about politics in the past are now actively participating in the activities of the reading newspaper groups. Ju Xilai, a cattle herder in Xiguan, Zuoquan, rarely participated in reading newspapers in the past, so he did not understand various policies very well. Once, he heard about the policy of protecting forests in the reading newspaper group, and he immediately realized. He said, "In the past, when I was herding cattle, I didn't care about protecting the forests, I just wanted to make sure the cattle were fed. Today, after hearing what the newspaper said, I realized that I had made a big mistake in the past." After hearing the reading newspaper group promote the Marriage Law, the old lady Zhang Bingri recalled the pain of past marriage unfreedom, and felt that what the newspaper said was reasonable and touching. Afterwards, when she heard someone reading the newspaper, she took the initiative to listen, and used the money she earned from selling eggs to subscribe to a copy of the Shanxi Pictorial.
    After the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a reading newspaper work conference, the county committees of all counties in the entire area strengthened their leadership over the reading newspaper groups. Before March of this year, all counties held propaganda member representative meetings or ran training classes to deploy and study the work of propaganda networks, reading newspapers, and communication. Zuoquan County plans to mobilize 30,000 people to participate in reading newspaper groups this year. Jiexiu County requires one newspaper for every fifty people. The Yushe County Committee instructed county and district cadres going to the countryside to participate in the reading newspaper groups in the villages where they are located, and to specifically guide the work of the reading newspaper groups.

### 榆次专区各县的读报工作有很大发展

    榆次专区各县的读报工作有很大发展
    编辑同志：山西榆次专区各县人民的读报工作，自中共榆次地委去年十一月召开读报工作会议以后，有了很大的发展。去年八月以前，全区共有读报组四千二百六十五个；到今年二月初，只介休、左权、徐沟、交城、汾阳、灵石、祁县、太谷、和顺九个县就发展到两万零五百二十四个组。
    读报组有力地推动了各种工作的开展。如昔阳县后庄村读报组员读了毛主席关于增产节约的号召后，立刻按照本村的情况，讨论了增产节约的问题。他们具体计算了去年全村的开支，只在唱戏和婚丧等事上，就浪费了二百九十九石粮食，而全年增产的粮食却只有一百五十石。这笔账使群众大吃一惊。大家决定今年要减少不必要的开支。全村估计可节省粮食一百六十九石，加上增产一百五十石，实际就增加了三百一十九石粮食的收入。这些粮食，够全村人民吃四个月，或买耕畜七十头。这种结合实际生活状况进行讨论的方法，教育了广大农民，全村很快就展开了增产节约运动。榆社、汾阳等县的读报组，读了高岗同志“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”的文章，连系自己的思想和互助合作的实际状况，展开了讨论，解决了许多人的糊涂思想。由于在讨论中明确了农村经济发展的方向，汾阳田家屯村的互助组有了很大的发展。
    读报工作开展后，农村中的政治空气浓厚起来了。过去人们拉闲话、说古书的场合，现在变成了讨论国家大事的地方。许多从来不关心政治的人，也积极地参加了读报组的活动。左权西关放牛工巨喜来过去很少参加读报，因此对各种政策都不大了解。有一次他在读报组里听了保护林木的政策，立刻恍然大悟。他说：“我以前放牛那管他护林不护林呀，反正让牛吃饱就算。今天听到报上说的，才知道我过去犯了很大的错误。”张丙日老太太听了读报组宣传婚姻法，就想起了过去婚姻不自由的痛苦，觉得报上说得句句入情入理，以后听到有人读报，她就主动去听，并把卖鸡蛋得来的钱，订了一份山西画报。
    中共榆次地委召开读报工作会议后，全专区各县县委对读报组的领导加强了。各县在今年三月以前，都召开了宣传员代表会或开办训练班，布置和研究了宣传网、读报及通讯等工作。左权县计划在今年发动三万人参加读报组。介休县要求每五十人有一份报。榆社县委指示下乡的县区干部都参加所在村读报组，并具体指导读报组工作。
