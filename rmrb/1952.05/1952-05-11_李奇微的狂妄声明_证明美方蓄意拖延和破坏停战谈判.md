Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th -- Ridgway, the commander of the invading U.S. forces in Korea, in his arrogant statement issued on the 7th, fully proved that the U.S. side deliberately put forward a brutal and unreasonable plan that our side could absolutely not accept, plotting to achieve its despicable aim of delaying and even sabotaging the ceasefire negotiations.

In his shameless statement, Ridgway said arrogantly: "Regardless of the enemy's opinions on individual issues, the Communist side needs to accept the United Nations Command's proposal in its entirety." Ridgway's extremely arrogant ultimatum-like threatening statement proves that the U.S. side completely lacks the sincerity of consultation and contains the conspiracy to sabotage the ceasefire negotiations.

What exactly is this thing that the U.S. side is trying to force our side to "accept in its entirety," and that Ridgway boasts of as a "fair and impartial" "comprehensive solution"? According to Truman's shameless statement issued on the 7th, this so-called solution includes three suggestions, namely: 1. "Not to forcibly repatriate prisoners of war as insisted upon by the Communists"; 2. "The United Nations Command will not insist on prohibiting the reconstruction or repair of airfields"; 3. "The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be composed of representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia selected by the Communist side, and Sweden and Switzerland selected by the United Nations." As everyone knows, the so-called issue of limiting airfield facilities is an issue created by the U.S. side in an attempt to interfere in Korean internal affairs and use it as a bargaining chip at the conference table, so it is an issue that has nothing to do with the ceasefire negotiations. And on the issue of nominating neutral nations, the United States has never been able to put forward any tenable reasons for opposing our plan. It can be seen that the only obstacle to reaching an agreement in the ceasefire negotiations is the issue of the repatriation of prisoners of war. And the reason why the prisoner of war issue has become a problem is precisely because the U.S. side has adopted an extremely brutal and unreasonable attitude on this issue. Not to mention the distant past, just on April 1, the U.S. representative said that the number of captured personnel exchanged with our side might be 116,000, but on April 19, they were only willing to repatriate 70,000, and wanted to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel. People can see from the U.S. side's lack of sincerity, inconsistency, and unreasonable attitude that the U.S. side's so-called "comprehensive solution" is not a "fair and impartial solution" at all, but a "smuggling solution." The U.S. side vainly attempts to use the so-called "concession" on an issue that is not a problem to exchange for our side's concession on the neutral nation issue and to accept their shameful forced detention of a large number of our captured personnel, the so-called "voluntary repatriation," on the prisoner of war issue. They attempt to force our side to "totally" swallow their so-called three suggestions through this trick of stealing the sky and changing the sun, and to deceive the people of the world through this rogue trick.

But no matter whether the U.S. side uses threats and intimidation, or uses "smuggling methods," it cannot scare anyone or deceive anyone. The people of the world now see very clearly that it is precisely the U.S. side that is adhering to the unreasonable proposition of detaining a large number of prisoners of war in violation of all international conventions, which has caused serious obstacles to the ceasefire negotiations. Our side has made it clear that we resolutely reject the U.S. side's unilateral and unreasonable plan. Only if the U.S. side abandons its shameless attempt to detain 100,000 of our captured personnel can there be a possibility of reaching an agreement in the negotiations. Ridgway's arrogant and unscrupulous shameless statement cannot affect our firm position in the slightest, but only more nakedly exposes the ugly face of the U.S. side deliberately delaying and sabotaging the ceasefire negotiations in front of the people of the world.

### 李奇微的狂妄声明  证明美方蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判

    李奇微的狂妄声明
    证明美方蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判
    【新华社开城十日电】侵朝美军总司令李奇微在七日发表的狂妄声明，完全证明美方故意提出为我方所绝对不能接受的横蛮无理的方案，阴谋达到其拖延以至破坏停战谈判的卑鄙目的。
    李奇微在他的无耻声明中骄横万状地说：“不管敌方对个别问题持什么意见，联合国军提出的办法需要共方全盘接受。”李奇微这个蛮横已极的最后通牒式的恫吓声明，证明美方完全缺乏协商的诚意并含有破坏停战谈判的阴谋。
    究竟这个美方企图强迫我方“全盘接受”的、被李奇微自吹自擂为“公正的和不偏不倚的”“全盘解决办法”是个什么样的东西呢？根据杜鲁门在七日发表的无耻声明中的说法，这个所谓办法包括三点建议，即是：一、“不像共产党所坚持的那样强迫遣返战俘”；二、“联合国军将不坚持禁止重建或修复机场”；三、“中立国监察委员会应由共方遴选的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和联合国遴选的瑞典、瑞士四国代表组成之。”谁都知道，所谓限制机场设备问题，是美方制造出来妄图干涉朝鲜内政并作为在会议桌上讨价还价的工具的问题，因此这是一个与停战谈判毫不相干的问题。而在中立国提名问题上，美国也从来提不出任何站得住脚的反对我方方案的理由。由此可见，唯一障碍停战谈判达成协议的是关于遣返战俘的问题。而战俘问题之所以成为问题，就是因为美方在这个问题上采取了极端蛮横无理的态度。远的不说，就在四月一日，美方代表还说和我方交换的被俘人员数目可能是十一万六千，但四月十九日却只愿遣返七万人，而要扣留我方十万以上的被俘人员了。人们从美方这种毫无诚意、出尔反尔、蛮不讲理的态度可以看出，美方的所谓“全盘解决办法”，完全不是什么“公正的和不偏不倚的办法”，而是一个“走私的办法”。美方妄想用在一个不成其为问题的问题上的所谓“让步”，来交换我方在中立国问题上让步并在战俘问题上接受他们见不得人的强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬办法。他们企图以这个办法来强迫我方“全盘”吞下他们的所谓三点建议，并通过这个偷天换日的流氓手法，蒙骗世界人民。
    但是无论美方用威胁恐吓的手段也好，用“走私的办法”也好，它是吓唬不了谁，也欺骗不了谁的。全世界人民现在看得很清楚，正是美方在坚持违反一切国际公约的扣留大批战俘的无理主张，使停战谈判遭遇严重的障碍。我方已经明白声明，我方断然拒绝美方这种片面无理的方案，只有美方放弃其扣留我方十万被俘人员的无耻企图，谈判才有达成协议的可能。李奇微的骄横恣肆的无耻声明，丝毫不能影响我方的坚定立场，只是在全世界人民面前更赤裸裸地暴露了美方蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判的丑恶面目而已。
