Cooperative Mutual Aid Model Village—Minji Village Farmers
    Guarantee a Yield Increase of One Stone of Grain Per Hectare This Year
    Respected Chairman Mao: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the help of our worker brothers, the people of our whole village have transformed the formerly notorious "Poor Sun Family Gully" into a prosperous Sun Family Gully in recent years. Now, 80 percent of the farmers in the village live a middle-peasant life. This is all because we followed Chairman Mao's instructions to take the path of organization, so everyone has become prosperous. In 1950, all the farmers in our village participated in mutual aid teams, and there was not a single individual farmer. Last year, there were twenty mutual aid teams in the village. This year, some mutual aid teams have developed into agricultural production cooperatives. Now, there are still nine permanent mutual aid teams (two more than last year) and three seasonal mutual aid teams (nine fewer than last year) in the village. The amount of grain harvested per hectare in the village has also increased year by year. Last year, we harvested eight stone and three pecks per hectare, exceeding the highest yield (in 1943) by 34 percent. This year, we plan to harvest nine stone and three pecks of grain per hectare, which will be an increase of one stone per hectare compared to last year.
    We must implement Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers" and Chairman Gao Gang's call to "increase grain production by five sheng per mu." After the village completed the grain purchase task of 380,000 jin ahead of schedule on March 20, under the leadership of the village's Communist Party branch, the mutual aid teams discussed for two days and formulated the village's patriotic production increase plan. We have written letters of challenge to labor models, mutual aid teams, and farmer brothers throughout the province, and we are prepared to launch a revolutionary patriotic production increase competition movement together with the farmer brothers throughout the province to support our volunteers and support national economic construction.
    Respectfully,
    All Farmers of Minji Village, Suihua Ninth District, Heilongjiang Province, a Cooperative Mutual Aid Model Village

    合作互助模范村——民吉村农民
    保证今年每垧地增产一石粮食
    敬爱的毛主席：我们全村人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在工人老大哥的帮助下，几年来已经把过去出名的“穷孙家沟子”变成富孙家沟子了。现在全村有百分之八十的农户过着中农生活。这都是因为我们按照毛主席的指示，走组织起来的道路，所以大家都富裕了。我们全村农户在一九五○年就都参加了互助组，没有一家单干户。去年全村是二十个互助组。今年有些互助组发展成了一个农业生产合作社。现在全村还有九个常年互助组（比去年增加两个），三个季节互助组（比去年减少九个）。全村每垧地打的粮食也一年比一年增多。去年每垧打八石三斗，超过最高产量的（一九四三年）百分之三十四，今年我们计划每垧地要打九石三斗粮，将比去年每垧增产一石粮。
    我们一定要贯彻毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召和高岗主席提出“每亩地多打五升粮”的号召。三月二十日全村提前超额完成了三十八万斤的购粮任务后。各互助组在村的共产党支部领导下，经两天讨论，又订出了全村的爱国增产计划。我们已给全省的劳动模范、互助组和农民弟兄们写了挑战书，准备和全省农民兄弟们一道，展开一个革命的爱国增产竞赛运动，来支援我们的志愿军，支援国家经济建设。敬礼
    黑龙江省合作互助模范绥化九区民吉村全体农民
