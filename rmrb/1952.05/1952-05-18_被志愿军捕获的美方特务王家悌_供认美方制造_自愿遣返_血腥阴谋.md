Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th. Our reporter Wang Shu reports: The confession of Wang Jiati, an American special agent captured by our army on March 29th, once again exposes the bloody conspiracy of the American aggressors to forcibly detain our captured personnel.

Wang Jiati, a native of Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, is 31 years old. In August 1951, he served as a trainee at the "CIE" school of the 72nd Regiment of the American prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. In December, he was promoted to principal of the school and also served as the head of the Propaganda and Investigation Section and secretary of the 63rd Branch of the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek on Geoje Island. In January of this year, Wang Jiati was transferred from the POW camp to the American Special Agent School in Tokyo for training. He returned to Seoul in early March. On March 21st, the American special agent agency dispatched Wang Jiati to sneak across the Jianghua Island from the entrance of the Han River to conduct intelligence gathering activities in the Haeju area of Ongjin Peninsula in northern Korea. He was captured by our army on March 29th.

Wang Jiati confessed to the bloody crimes committed by the American aggressors in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island in fabricating the so-called "voluntary repatriation," stating: After the Korean armistice negotiations began last year, in order to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, the American aggressors successively transferred more than 100 Chiang Kai-shek special agents from Taiwan to serve as "instructors" and other positions in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. At that time, a total of seven Chiang Kai-shek special agents were sent to the 72nd Regiment, including five who also served as "instructors," namely: team leader Zhang Xingdeng (from Fujian, over 40 years old, who had served as a county magistrate and middle school principal in the Chiang Kai-shek government), Zhang Qide (that is, Zhang Qidong, whom the previously reported American airborne special agent Liu Chenghan mistakenly identified, from Tianjin, over 30 years old, who had worked in the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Headquarters), Zhang Bi (from Shanghai, 24 years old, who had worked in the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense), Wang Jizhong (from Jiangsu, 30 years old), and Gan Biying (from Guangdong, over 30 years old). In addition, there were two "announcers" who specialized in broadcasting reactionary news, one of whom was named Pan Tianxin (from Shanghai). The "CIE" school forced our captured personnel to undergo training, and an examination had to be held once a month, at which time three other Chiang Kai-shek "instructors" would come to invigilate.

Wang Jiati confessed that these criminal activities of Chiang Kai-shek special agents in persecuting our captured personnel were all carried out under the instructions and supervision of the American special agent agency "CIC." In October last year, when our captured personnel of the 4th Battalion of the 72nd Regiment refused to have tattoos on their arms, the American special agent of the "CIC" stationed on Geoje Island, nicknamed "Pockface Captain," immediately questioned Wang Youmin, the secretary of the Chiang Kai-shek "Kuomintang Branch" and the captain of the 4th Battalion, and ordered him to immediately take effective measures to force our captured personnel to get tattoos. Wang Youmin hurriedly convened a meeting of squad leaders and ordered them to complete the task of forced tattooing within a week. The American special agent agency "CIC" also frequently sent people to the prisoner-of-war camp regiments to inspect and urge. By November last year, before the start of the fourth item on the agenda of negotiations, the American special agent agency "CIC" hurriedly instructed Chiang Kai-shek special agents to force our captured personnel to sign and put blood fingerprints on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" "petitions." In November, an American "CIC" special agent, Captain Booth, personally found Wang Shunqing, the Chiang Kai-shek special agent who was the commander of the 72nd Regiment, and ordered him to force all of our captured personnel to sign and affix blood fingerprints to the "petition" forged by Chiang Kai-shek special agents that night. Booth also said that he would personally take the "petition" to the Far East Command of the American invading army in Tokyo the next day. Wang Shunqing knew that this behavior would be rejected and opposed by our captured personnel, and he did not hesitate to use the most shameless methods, ordering the Chiang Kai-shek special agents to make white paper the same size as the "petition," and then deceive our captured personnel into signing these blank sheets of paper. When these despicable conspiracies were exposed by our captured personnel, the bandits became enraged and used beatings and torture to persecute the captured personnel.

Wang Jiati confessed that in order to inspect the preparations made by the American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents to forcibly detain our captured personnel, the commander of the American invading army, Ridgway, personally "inspected" the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island in November last year. Wang Jiati said: At about 10:00 a.m. that day, the American special agent agency "CIC" notified Wang Shunqing that Ridgway would come to the 72nd Regiment at 2:00 p.m. and ordered him to make all preparations. Wang Shunqing quickly convened an emergency meeting and rushed to make "petitions" requesting "voluntary repatriation" again. Because time was very tight, Wang Shunqing ordered the battalions to rush to write a roster of our captured personnel, and all the Chiang Kai-shek special agents of the battalion headquarters affixed blood fingerprints on their behalf. This roster of "petitions" covered with the fingerprints of Chiang Kai-shek bandits was handed over to Ridgway by the American military police lieutenant colonel commander of Geoje Island at 2:00 p.m. that day.

This is the truth about the conspiracy of the so-called "voluntary repatriation" manufactured by the American aggressors, and it is also the truth about the so-called "screening."

### 被志愿军捕获的美方特务王家悌  供认美方制造“自愿遣返”血腥阴谋

    被志愿军捕获的美方特务王家悌
    供认美方制造“自愿遣返”血腥阴谋
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】本社记者王殊报道：在三月二十九日被我军捕获的美方特务王家悌的供状，又一次揭露了美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员的血腥阴谋。
    王家悌，四川成都市人，三十一岁，一九五一年八月在巨济岛美方俘虏营七十二联队“CIE”学校任学员，十二月升任该校校长，并曾任巨济岛蒋介石国民党六三支部宣传调查股长及支部秘书等职。本年一月，王家悌调离战俘营，去东京美国特务学校受训，三月上旬返回汉城。三月二十一日美方特务机关派遣王家悌自汉江入口处江华岛偷渡，潜来朝鲜北部瓮津半岛海州地区进行收集情报的特务活动，于三月二十九日被我军捕获。
    王家悌供述美国侵略者在巨济岛俘虏营中制造所谓“自愿遣返”的血腥罪行称：去年朝鲜停战谈判开始后，美国侵略者为强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员，曾从台湾陆续调来蒋介石特务一百多人，在巨济岛俘虏营中充任“教官”和其他职务。当时派到第七十二联队的蒋介石特务共有七人，其中兼任“教官”的有五人，计有组长张兴登（福建人，四十多岁，曾任蒋介石政府县长及中学校长等职），张启德（即前已报道的美军空降特务刘承汉所误供的张启东，天津人，三十多岁，曾在蒋介石空军总部供职），张弼（上海人，二十四岁，曾在蒋介石国防部供职），王纪中（江苏人，三十岁）和甘碧英（广东人，三十多岁）。另外有两名专司播送反动新闻的“播音员”，其中一名叫潘天新（上海人）。“CIE”学校强迫我方被俘人员受训，每月须举行一次考试，到时另有三名蒋介石“教官”前来监考。
    王家悌供称：这些蒋介石特务迫害我被俘人员的罪恶活动，都是在美国特务机关“CIC”指使和监督下进行的。去年十月间，七十二联队四大队的我方被俘人员拒绝在臂上刺字，美国“CIC”驻巨济岛的外号叫“麻脸上尉”的美国特务，便立刻责问蒋介石“国民党支部”书记长兼四大队大队长王有敏，并命令他立即采取有效办法，强迫我方被俘人员刺字。王有敏就急忙召集小队长开会，限令他们在一周内完成强迫刺字任务。美国特务机关“CIC”并经常派人到俘虏营联队中进行检查和催逼。到了去年十一月，即第四项议程谈判开始以前，美国特务机关“CIC”又急忙地指使蒋介石特务强迫我方被俘人员在所谓“自愿遣返”的“请愿书”上签名并按血指印。十一月，一名美国“CIC”特务蒲斯（BOOTH）上尉亲自找到第七十二联队联队长蒋介石特务王顺清，限令他在当晚强迫我全体被俘人员在蒋介石特务伪造的“请愿书”上签名和加按血指印。蒲斯并说他将在第二天将“请愿书”亲自带往东京美国侵略军远东司令部。王顺清知道这种行为将遭到我方被俘人员的拒绝和反对，竟不惜采用最无耻的办法，命令各蒋介石特务用白纸制成与“请愿书”同样大小的纸片，然后欺骗我方被俘人员在这些空白纸上签名。当这些卑鄙阴谋被我方被俘人员揭穿后，匪徒们恼羞成怒，又以毒打和酷刑等手段迫害被俘人员。
    王家悌供称：为了检查美蒋特务强行扣留我方被俘人员的准备工作，美国侵略军总司令李奇微曾在去年十一月间亲自“视察”了巨济岛俘虏营。王家悌称：当天上午十时左右，美国特务机关“CIC”便通知王顺清说：李奇微要在下午二时到七十二联队，限令他作好一切准备工作。王顺清连忙召集紧急会议，再度赶制要求“自愿遣返”的“请愿书”。因时间已很紧迫，王顺清就命令各大队赶写我被俘人员名册，由大队部蒋介石特务全部代按血指印。这件盖满蒋匪特务指印的“请愿书”名册，就于当日下午二时经由巨济岛美方宪兵中校司令转交李奇微。
    这就是美国侵略者一手制造的所谓“自愿遣返”的阴谋的真相，也是所谓“甄别”的真相。
