    The Seventh Anniversary of the Heroic Soviet Army's Liberation of Czechoslovakia
    By Kopecky, Minister of Propaganda and Culture of the Czechoslovak Republic
    Head of the Government Delegation of the Czechoslovak Republic

    May 9th this year marks the seventh anniversary of the heroic Soviet Army's liberation of Czechoslovakia. On this important national holiday, the Czechoslovak people once again deeply appreciate the Soviet Union's victory over German fascism, which liberated our motherland and made it possible for us to build a happy new life. The Czechoslovak people love Comrade Stalin, who in May 1945 sent the Soviet army to rescue Prague from destruction and liberate the Czechoslovak Republic from the oppression of the German Nazi oppressors, thereby victoriously ending the war in Europe.

    The Czechoslovak people are celebrating May 9th with the great achievements they have made in building a new life in their own country over the past seven years. The Czechoslovak people, who finally freed themselves from the bourgeoisie in the victory of February 1948, now look back with justified pride on how far they have advanced along the path of socialism. It must be pointed out that Czechoslovak industry, which has been completely nationalized in the past few years, is now organized as a socialist industry. Our trade has been almost completely incorporated into the socialist distribution system. The socialist component of Czechoslovak agriculture is also growing. Today, 30 percent of all arable land in Czechoslovakia is collectively cultivated by socialist-type united agricultural cooperatives—representing our collective farms, or by state-owned farms—representing our Soviet farms.

    Many slogans will be written on the banner of May 9th this year to encourage Czechoslovak workers to further strengthen their labor and creative efforts, to further develop socialist competition and the movement of shock workers, innovators, and Stakhanovite workers. All these encouragements are aimed at completing the first Czechoslovak Five-Year Plan. The goal for this year, the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, is to realize great socialist construction, build new blast furnaces and powerful steel mills, and increase steel production by millions of tons, thereby expanding the production of heavy machinery and general machinery, and meeting export needs. It must be mentioned that the Czechoslovak socialist economy, with the growth of Czechoslovak industry and technology as its development foundation, is primarily and firmly committed to the further development of heavy industry, machinery manufacturing, and the chemical industry. In contrast to the capitalist Czechoslovakia of the "Bata" era, which was characterized by the export of light industrial products, our new people's democratic Czechoslovakia has determined a policy of focusing on the export of heavy industrial products. We export machines, locomotives, motorcycles, power station equipment, lathes, cables, steel pipes, wires, chemical glassware, and more. From this, it can be seen that Czechoslovakia, as a part of the world of peace, democracy, and socialism, has an important mission and a prosperous future.

    From the discussion of the 1952 Czechoslovak national budget, it can once again be proven how huge accumulations the sources of the socialist economy can achieve. It enables the state to spend more crowns (Czech currency) to further build industrial enterprises, develop transportation, build dormitories, hospitals, schools, theaters, etc. It can continue to improve the living standards of the working masses—not only materially, but also culturally, in terms of better sanitary equipment and social welfare.

    Undoubtedly, Czechoslovakia is advancing along the socialist path at a rapid pace. The decisive factor here is the selfless and fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, which not only supplies us with a large number of necessities, but also, like helping other people's democratic countries, sends experts, advisors, professors, and Stakhanovite workers, and uses their rich experience to teach us to apply new socialist forms in all aspects of life. With the help of the Soviet Union's experience, we are now educating our workers with a new attitude towards social wealth, a new socialist spirit of labor, and new socialist working methods. We take the Soviet example as a guide to equip and organize our industry, to mechanize and automate the production process, to solve the problem of labor potential, to mechanize agricultural production, and to apply the agricultural scientific theories of Michurin and Lysenko, and so on. We also follow the example of the Soviet Union to lead our culture, education, and art, so that they can cultivate new socialist people in our country, and strive to make our nation's sports, morality, and emotions, as well as all aspects of our motherland, adapt to the era in which we live today—the socialist era, an era in which Comrade Klement Gottwald, a loyal student of Lenin and Stalin, leads us forward.

    While celebrating this year's May 9th, we, the Czechoslovak people, will once again declare that people's democratic Czechoslovakia stands closely with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in defending the sacred cause of peace. Today, the Czechoslovak people express great concern and solidarity with the heroic battles of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and severely condemn the barbaric germ warfare carried out by the vile and shameless US imperialism. All the Czechoslovak people fervently hope that the Korean War can end soon, and hope that the Chinese people can peacefully build a happy new life, which the Chinese people have won after more than 20 years of heroic and long-term struggles under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. Czechoslovakia, which occupies an extremely important position on the border between the world's two major camps, is willing to make any effort for the common cause of the peace camp. The Czechoslovak people are aware of their responsibilities and actively improve their national defense capabilities, confidently preventing US imperialism from turning West Germany into a base of aggression. The patriotic enthusiasm and firm determination of the Czechoslovak people are strengthened by the following fact: from the western border of Czechoslovakia to the Pacific Ocean, from Prague to Guangzhou, stretches the vast territory of peace, democracy, and socialism, which represents the invincible strength of nearly one billion people.

    US imperialism's several attempts to shake the firm stance of the Czechoslovak people have all been in vain. US imperialism relied on those who sold their souls to the Tito-Trotsky ambitionists and the bourgeois nationalists, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's traitors Slánský, Švábová, Sling, Clementis and others, to organize conspiracy plans against our republic, which also ended in failure. Under the power of the Czechoslovak people's consciousness, the Slánský clique was eliminated. This year's May 9th is an opportunity for our party—the Czechoslovak Communist Party—to express our firm loyalty to the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, to the principles of Bolshevism, and to the great ideas of Lenin and Stalin.

    The author of this article feels particularly honored to celebrate the anniversary of Czechoslovakia's liberation on May 9th while the Czechoslovak government delegation is staying in the friendly People's Republic of China. We came to China as representatives of the Czechoslovak government, first of all to express the Czechoslovak people's love for the People's Republic of China, and to express the Czechoslovak people's deep respect for Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people. We have an important mission to sign four agreements between the governments of the Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of China, which will help further develop friendly cooperation between our two countries in culture, science, technology, and transportation. The Czechoslovak government delegation has been warmly received by the government of the People's Republic of China. Before the signing of these agreements, we toured most of China, visited the historical and cultural relics of four thousand years of China, witnessed the vastness, beauty, and treasures of great China, saw the results of the Chinese people's creative and diligent labor over the past three years, and further understood the needs of the new people's democratic China in its construction. On May 6, 1952, we signed four Sino-Czech agreements in the solemn city of Beijing, in an atmosphere full of harmony and joy. We are deeply convinced that our two countries can become sincere friends and help each other on the basis of mutual benefit in economics, culture, science, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. Many bonds of friendship unite us: we are jointly committed to the beautiful new life of our working people, jointly dedicated to the cause of peace, dedicated to the friendship of all nations and proletarian internationalism, and the most powerful bond is our common love for the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin, because the Soviet Union's victory over German fascism and Japanese militarism enabled the people of our two countries to build their own new lives today, and enabled us to cross thousands of miles to shake hands for mutual cooperation.

    On May 9, 1952—the banner of the seventh anniversary of the birth of the new people's democratic Czechoslovak Republic—is written with enthusiastic slogans of consolidating Sino-Czech friendship. In the name of this friendship, the Czechoslovak people, on May 9th, unanimously pay tribute to our beloved leader—President of the Czechoslovak Republic Klement Gottwald, to Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong, and to the genius leader of all progressive mankind and the standard-bearer of the struggle for world peace—the great Stalin.

    英雄的苏联军队解放捷克斯洛伐克的七周年
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国宣传与文化部部长
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团团长  柯别茨基
    今年五月九日是英雄的苏联军队解放捷克斯洛伐克的七周年。捷克斯洛伐克人民在这一重要的国家节日，再次深深地感激苏联对德国法西斯的胜利，使我们的祖国获得自由，使我们有可能建设幸福的新生活。捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱斯大林同志，他在一九四五年五月间，派遣苏联军队从毁灭下解救了布拉格，从德国纳粹压迫者的手中解放了捷克斯洛伐克共和国，从而胜利地结束了欧洲的战争。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民以过去七年来在自己的祖国建设新生活的伟大成就，来庆祝五月九日。在一九四八年二月的胜利中最后摆脱开资产阶级的捷克斯洛伐克人民，如今以正当的自豪来回顾它沿着社会主义的道路已经迈进了多远。必须指出，过去数年间业已全部国有化的捷克斯洛伐克工业，现在已经组成为社会主义工业。我们的贸易差不多已经完全纳入社会主义分配系统中。捷克斯洛伐克农业中的社会主义成份也在增长。如今捷克斯洛伐克全部耕地的百分之三十，是由社会主义型的联合农业合作社——代表我们的集体农庄，或由国营农庄——代表我们的苏维埃农庄，所集体耕种。
    在今年五月九日的旗帜上将写着许多标语，以鼓舞捷克斯洛伐克工人进一步加强自己的劳动和创造性努力，进一步开展社会主义竞赛和突击工人、革新者与斯塔哈诺夫式工人的运动。所有这些鼓舞都是为了完成第一个捷克斯洛伐克五年计划。五年计划第四年的今年的目标是：实现伟大的社会主义建设，建筑新的鼓风炉和强大的钢铁联合厂，使钢铁的产量提高数百万吨，借以扩大重机器和一般机器的生产，并满足出口的需要。必须提到，以捷克斯洛伐克工业与技术成长为发展基础的捷克斯洛伐克社会主义经济，首先坚持地致力于重工业、机器制造业和化学工业的进一步发展。和“拔佳”时代的资本主义捷克斯洛伐克以输出轻工业品为特点相反，我们新的人民民主捷克斯洛伐克确定了以输出重工业品为主的方针，我们输出机器、车头、摩托车、电力站装备、车床、电缆、钢管、电线、化学玻璃制品以及其他。由此可见，作为和平、民主与社会主义世界的组成部分之一的捷克斯洛伐克，有着重要的使命和繁荣的未来。
    从一九五二年的捷克斯洛伐克国家预算的讨论中，可以再次证明社会主义经济源泉能够达到如何巨大的积累。它使国家有可能支出更多的克朗（捷币）以进一步建设工业企业，发展交通，建筑宿舍、医院、学校、剧院等等。它可以继续提高劳动群众的生活水平——不仅在物质方面，而且也在文化方面，在更完善的卫生设备和社会福利方面。
    无疑的，捷克斯洛伐克是以迅速的步子沿着社会主义道路而前进的。在这里的决定性因素是苏联的大公无私和亲如兄弟的帮助，苏联不仅供给我们大量的必需品，而且也和帮助其他人民民主国家一样，派遣了专家、顾问、教授和斯塔哈诺夫工作者，并用他们的丰富经验来教导我们在生活的各方面应用新的社会主义形式。借助苏联的经验，我们现在正以对社会财富的新态度，新的社会主义劳动精神，新的社会主义工作方法，来教育我们的工人。我们把苏联的榜样作为指针，以配备和组织我们的工业，以使生产过程机械化和自动化，以解决劳动潜力的问题，以使农业生产机械化，并应用米丘林和李森科的农业科学学说等等。我们也遵循苏联的榜样，来领导我们的文化、教育和艺术，使之能够在我们的国家培养出社会主义的新人，并努力使我国国民的体育、道德和感情以及我们祖国的各方面，都能适应我们今日所处的时代——社会主义时代，作为列宁和斯大林的忠实学生的克利门特·哥特瓦尔德同志领导着我们前进的时代。
    在庆祝今年的五月九日的时候，我们捷克斯洛伐克人民将再次宣示，人民民主捷克斯洛伐克是紧密地站在捍卫神圣和平事业的苏联和其他人民民主国家这方面的。今天捷克斯洛伐克人民将对朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的英雄战斗表示极大关怀和休戚与共，并对卑鄙无耻地进行野蛮的细菌战的美帝国主义予以严厉斥责。所有的捷克斯洛伐克人民都热烈希望朝鲜战争能够早日结束，并希望中国人民能够和平地建设幸福的新生活，这新生活是中国人民在光荣的中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导下，经过二十多年的英勇的长期战斗而赢得的。在世界的两大阵营边境上占有极重要地位的捷克斯洛伐克，愿为和平阵营的共同事业而作任何努力。捷克斯洛伐克人民觉悟到自己的责任，并积极地提高自己的国防能力，充满信心地制止美帝国主义把西德变为侵略基地的威胁。捷克斯洛伐克人民的爱国热忱和坚定果敢为下面的事实所加强：从捷克斯洛伐克的西陲直到太平洋，从布拉格直到广东，伸展着辽阔广大的和平、民主与社会主义的领域，这个领域代表着近十亿人民的不可战胜的力量。
    美帝国主义几次企图动摇捷克斯洛伐克人民的坚定立场，结果都是徒然。美帝国主义依赖那些把灵魂出卖给铁托——托洛茨基野心分子的和资产阶级民族主义的、捷克斯洛伐克共产党的叛徒斯兰斯基、斯威莫娃、斯林、克利门蒂斯之流，组织反对我们共和国的阴谋计划，也宣告失败了。在捷克斯洛伐克人民的觉悟的力量下，斯兰斯基党羽被消灭了。今年五月九日对我们的党——捷克斯洛伐克共产党是一个机会，以表示我们坚定地忠于马克思—列宁主义学说，忠于布尔什维主义的原则和列宁、斯大林的伟大思想。
    本文作者适值捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团逗留在友好的中华人民共和国之际，来庆祝五月九日捷克斯洛伐克解放纪念日，感到特别荣幸。我们作为捷克斯洛伐克政府的代表来到中国，首先是为了表达捷克斯洛伐克人民对中华人民共和国的热爱，表达捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的深深崇敬的感情。我们负有重要使命，来签订捷克斯洛伐克共和国和中华人民共和国政府之间的四个协定，这些协定将有助于我们两国之间在文化、科学、技术和交通等方面进一步发展友谊的合作。捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团备受中华人民共和国政府的热诚招待，在这些协定签订之前，我们游览了中国的大部，参观了四千年中国的历史和文化的古迹，见识了伟大中国的广袤、美景和宝藏，看到了中国人民三年来创造性和勤勉劳动的成果，并进一步知道了新的人民民主中国在建设中的需要。一九五二年五月六日，我们在庄严的北京城，在充满融洽和欢愉的气氛中，签订了四个捷中协定。我们深信我们两国能成为诚挚的朋友，并在经济、文化、科学、技术、电信交通等方面，在互利的基础上互相帮助。许多友谊的纽带把我们联合起来：我们共同致力于我们劳动人民的美好的新生活，共同献身于和平事业，献身于各民族的友谊和无产阶级的国际主义，而最有力的纽带是我们对苏联和斯大林同志的共同热爱，因为苏联对德国法西斯和日本军国主义的胜利，使我们两国人民能够建设自己现在的新生活，并使我们能够越过万里路程，为了互相合作而握手。
    在一九五二年五月九日——新的人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国诞生七周年的旗帜上，写着巩固捷中友谊的热烈的口号。捷克斯洛伐克人民在这友谊的名义下，在五月九日，一致地向我们敬爱的领袖——捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统克利门特·哥特瓦尔德致敬，向中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东致敬，向全体进步人类的天才领袖和争取世界和平的旗手——伟大的斯大林致敬。（附图片）
