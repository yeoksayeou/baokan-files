Xinhua News Agency, Toronto: According to TASS, the Canadian National Conference for Peace, Disarmament, and Trade was held in Toronto from May 10th to 11th. More than 2,800 representatives from all provinces, nationalities, and sectors of Canada attended.

    Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, delivered a report to the conference. He emphasized that the fundamental condition for ensuring peace is that all countries agree to resolve their differences through negotiation and coexist peacefully regardless of differences in social and economic systems. Wen Youzhang said that this conference must discuss the possibility of eliminating these differences. Wen Youzhang then pointed out that in order to end the arms race and conclude a peace treaty among the major powers, the United Nations Disarmament Commission currently meeting in New York must unanimously reach an agreement on a plan for universal disarmament throughout the world, and unanimously reach an agreement on strict disarmament and strict supervision. Wen Youzhang then pointed out that the conference should also discuss the issue of developing Canada's trade with all countries. Wen Youzhang finally talked about the issue of U.S. germ warfare. He emphasized that the accusations against the United States for conducting germ warfare are completely correct. During his recent visit to China, he personally investigated this issue and saw evidence of U.S. germ warfare. He condemned germ warfare as a "threat to every family in the world." Wen Youzhang's speech was met with prolonged and enthusiastic applause from the participants.

    Many representatives who spoke at the meeting emphasized the importance of defending peace. The conference finally passed a resolution stating that international tensions and economic difficulties can only be eliminated through major power negotiations, the conclusion of peace treaties, disarmament, and the development of international trade. The conference also elected a National Council of the Canadian Peace Congress composed of 137 people.

    After the meeting, a grand All-Toronto Peace Conference was held at the "Maple Leaf Gardens" sports field, with more than 10,000 people participating. The conference listened to a recorded congratulatory message from the famous American Black peace fighter Dr. Du Bois. Wen Youzhang spoke at the meeting about his recent visit to China and again condemned the U.S. crimes of germ warfare in Korea and China.

    加举行全国争取和平、裁军与通商会议
    文幼章谴责美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社多伦多讯：加拿大全国争取和平、裁军与通商会议于五月十日至十一日在多伦多举行。出席的有加拿大各省、各民族、各界代表共两千八百余人。
    加拿大和平大会主席文幼章向大会作报告。他着重指出，要想保障和平，基本条件就是一切国家都同意用谈判来解决它们之间的分歧，并不问社会制度和经济制度的不同而和平共处。文幼章说，这次大会必须讨论消除这些分歧的可能性。文幼章接着指出，为了终止扩张军备运动并在大国间缔结和平公约，目前正在纽约开会的联合国裁减军备委员会必须就全世界普遍裁减军备的计划一致取得协议，并就严格裁减军备及严格实行监督的问题一致取得协议。文幼章继而指出，大会还应该讨论发展加拿大与一切国家的贸易的问题。文幼章最后谈到美国进行细菌战的问题，他着重指出，关于指责美国进行细菌战争一事是完全正确的。他最近访问中国时，曾对这一问题亲自进行过调查，看见了美国进行细菌战的证据。他谴责细菌战是“危及世界上每一个家庭的威胁”。文幼章的演说得到与会者历久不息的欢呼。
    在会上发言的许多代表都着重强调保卫和平的重要。会议最后通过决议称：只有以大国谈判、缔结和平公约、裁减军备、发展国际贸易等办法，才可以消除国际紧张局势和经济困难。大会并选出由一百三十七人组成的加拿大和平大会全国理事会。
    会后，在“枫叶花园”的运动场举行了盛大的全多伦多市和平大会，参加的有一万多人。大会听取了美国著名黑人和平战士杜波依斯博士的贺词录音。文幼章在会上讲述他最近访问中国的情况，并再度谴责美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战争的罪行。
