To be honest, my mind is not very sharp. For example, one day the cultural instructor taught five characters, and I worked hard to recite them, sweating profusely, and only managed to remember two characters. But after a night's sleep, the next day I picked up the book and couldn't recognize a single character. I went back to class feeling frustrated, and it so happened that the instructor wrote these characters on the blackboard and asked me to recognize them. Everyone looked at me, I looked at the blackboard, and the whole class was stunned. The instructor said, "Li Wanjun, how come you haven't learned five characters in a day? Comrade, you need to work hard!" I wanted to explain the reason, but I was afraid of wasting everyone's time, so I swallowed the words back.

I have been studying culture for a long time, but I forget two out of every three characters I learn each day. At this rate, like an old ox pulling a broken cart, when will I ever solve the problem of my low cultural level? I'm thirty years old, and my mind is dull, the more I think about it, the more upset I become.

This time, the higher authorities sent a teacher Chen to our company, saying that he had brought a new method of learning culture - a rapid literacy method, capable of teaching two thousand characters in two months. On the first day of school, the teacher especially emphasized that age doesn't matter, he had previously used this method to improve the cultural level of a fifty-nine-year-old comrade. I was very happy to hear this, and I also expressed my determination.

On the first day, the blackboard was filled with 勹攵冖匚. I thought to myself, what's the use of learning these things? But seeing that the teacher was teaching so earnestly, I thought, let's just learn it and see what new methods he has. In just a few tens of minutes, the two literacy assault teams had completely mastered it, leaving behind a few of us who had fallen behind. The teacher was sweating profusely trying to teach us, but I just couldn't learn it well; others could skillfully use the letters, but I hadn't even learned a third of them. I was too embarrassed to explain my feelings to the teacher, so on the fourth day, I joined everyone in learning pinyin. When learning two-part pinyin, the teacher noticed that my mood was not right, so he asked for my opinion. I said it was nothing. He then asked if I had any difficulties, and I said that my biggest difficulty was that my mind was too dull. Teacher Chen said, "Don't be afraid of being dull, as long as you can delve into it, I guarantee you'll learn quickly!" I said, "Teacher Chen, if you can teach me five hundred characters in a year, I'll use a year's worth of my allowance to treat you!" Teacher Chen laughed and said, "As long as you work hard, I guarantee you'll recognize two thousand characters in two months, and I don't need you to treat me."

From then on, the teacher paid close attention to me in class; and outside of class, he helped me specifically whenever he had time. I was learning so much every day that I felt dizzy, and my eyes kept tearing up because of a problem, but I still worked hard to learn.

On the first day of the character assault, a total of one hundred and sixty characters were taught. Some people even complained that it was too few, but it was really hard for me. In the evening, the class registered the learning achievements of the whole class, and mine was the least, I was probably the one who learned the least of the whole company. Teacher Chen asked how many I had learned, and I said, "Eight!" He said, "Not bad, in the past you only learned a dozen in five or six years, but today you learned eight in one go, keep up the good work, there is hope..." Lying in bed that night, I thought: if I can learn eight a day, that's still remarkable in a year! No, from today on, I must strive to improve day by day.

The next day, more than a hundred characters were taught again. I still learned according to the method the teacher taught me, and I made great progress, I remembered thirty-nine characters. The comrades in the class encouraged me, and I was even praised by name when the leaders called the roll. On the third day, I got the hang of it, and my enthusiasm also increased, and I learned eighty-three characters in one day. At this time, I felt that my mind was also working better, and my eyes were no longer tearing up, and in five days I finished learning the new characters in the first book of the national language. On the seventh day, the teacher gave me a copy of the first book of the national language and asked me to read it. I said, is this okay? The teacher said: try it, and if it doesn't work, I'll teach you again. So I opened the book, rubbed my eyes, and read more than twenty lessons in one breath, without encountering any new characters, and the more I read, the more energetic I became. The teacher kept encouraging me while I was reading. I read the whole textbook and only encountered ten or so new characters. At this time, a sentence welled up from my heart: "Teacher Chen, my eyes are bright, you helped me to brighten them!" He said: "No, it's not, it's your own efforts, and also, the leadership of the higher authorities and the help of the comrades..."

By the ninth day of the character assault, I had learned one thousand one hundred and twenty-five new characters. In the last two days, the comrades in the class who originally recognized more characters than me, came to ask me about new characters instead, and I was a little embarrassed, but as long as I knew them, I would patiently tell them.

Although I have achieved these initial results in my studies, this is only the beginning. In the future, I will definitely follow the instructions of the higher authorities, continue to work hard to study, improve my cultural level, and be a well-rounded national defense soldier, proficient in both military affairs and culture.

    我的眼睛开始亮了
    李万军
    说句老实话，我的头脑是很不灵的。譬如有一天文化教员教了五个字，我就下工夫念呀念呀，弄得满头大汗，好歹才记住了两个字。可是睡了一觉，第二天拿起本子一看，一个字也不认识了。我别着气再去上课，恰巧教员把这些字写在黑板上叫我来认。大家看我，我看黑板，全课堂都楞住了。教员说：“李万军，怎么一天还没有学会五个字呢？同志，须要努力呀！”我本想说说原因，但怕耽误了大家的时间，就又把话咽了回去。
    文化学习的时间很长了，可是我一天学三个字就忘两个。这样老牛拉破车，几时才能解决文化水平不高的问题呢？三十岁的人啦，头脑又笨，我越想越难过。
    这次上级派了个陈教员来到连队上，说是他带来了学文化的新方法——速成识字法，两个月能学两千字。开学的那一天，教员特别强调说，年纪大也没关系，他以前就用这方法把一个五十九岁的老同志的文化水平提高了。我听了也很高兴，我也表示了决心。
    头一天，黑板上写的是勹攵冖匚。我心里就想，学这些玩艺儿有什么用呢？不过看教员教的挺认真，学就学吧，看他有什么新方法。只几十分钟，两个识字突击队全突击会了，剩了我们几个掉下队的。教员累得满头大汗在教我们，而我怎么也学不好；别人都能熟练地运用字母了，可是我还没有学会三分之一的字母。我也不好意思向教员说明我的情绪，第四天就随着大家一块学拼音了。学二拼音的时候，教员发现了我的情绪不对劲，他就征求我的意见。我说没有什么。他又问我有什么困难，我说最大的困难是头脑太笨。陈教员说：“不要怕笨，只要能钻进去，保证学得很快！”我说：“陈教员，你在一年内能教会我五百字，我就用一年的津贴费来请你的客！”陈教员笑了，说：“只要你努力，两个月保证你认识两千个字，我也不要你请客。”
    从此以后，教员在课堂上非常注意我；在课外，他一有空就具体地帮助我。我成天学得昏头昏脑的，眼睛因为有毛病直淌泪，可是我还是努力地学了下去。
    突击生字的头一天，一共教了一百六十个字。有人还嫌教得少，我可真够吃力了。晚上，班里登记全班学习成绩，就数我的少，恐怕全连队谁也比我学会的多。陈教员问我会了多少，我说：“八个！”他说：“还不错呵，过去你五六年只学了十几个，今天一下就是八个，继续努力，有希望……”晚上躺在床上我也想：一天能学八个，一年也了不起啊！不，从今天起我要争取一天比一天进步。
    第二天又教了一百多字。我还是照着教员告诉的方法学，大有进步了，我记住了三十九个字。班里的同志鼓励我，上级点名时还表扬了我。第三天我就摸到了门儿，劲头也大了，一天就学会了八十三个字。这时我感到我的头脑也好使了，眼睛也不淌泪了，五天就把第一册国语上的生字给学完了。第七天，教员给了我一本第一册国语书，要我念。我说这还行？教员说：试试吧，不行我再教你。我就翻开书，揉了揉眼，一口气就念了二十多课，没碰到生字，越念越有劲。教员在我念的时候就一鼓劲地鼓励我。我把课本全念完了，才碰到十来个生字。这时，我从心里涌出来一句话：“陈教员，我的眼睛亮了，是你帮我擦亮的！”他说：“不，不是，是你自己的努力，还有，上级的领导和同志们的帮助……。”
    到突击生字的第九天，我学会了一千一百二十五个生字。最后两天，班里原来比我认字多的同志，倒向我来问生字了，我还有些不大好意思的，但只要是我认识的，我就耐心地告诉他。
    我虽然在学习中初步取得了这些成绩，但这仅是个开始。今后，我一定按照上级的指示，继续努力学习，提高我的文化水平，做一个文武双全的国防军人。
