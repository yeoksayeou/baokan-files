    ▲The Hexi region of Gansu is a well-known arid area, and a good harvest is impossible without water conservancy. Since last winter and this spring, the land reform has been universally completed in the counties of this region. The farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high, and most of them have completed spring ploughing and sowing ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. Then they began to work intensively on ditching and dam construction. As of mid-April, the ditches, dams, and wells built by farmers in eight counties including Zhangye, Yongchang, Yongdeng, and Minqin can increase the irrigated area by more than 99,000 mu.
    ▲The spring afforestation work in the Central and Southern China region this year has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from six provinces, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and the city of Wuhan, as of mid-April, the afforestation area has reached more than 1.88 million mu, with a survival rate generally ranging from 60% to 85%. This spring, the Central and Southern provinces have focused on the river basins and sandy areas to vigorously construct water source forests and shelter forests. For the needs of national construction, the Central and Southern provinces have also cultivated and developed resource forests in timber production areas this spring. Now, in Guangdong Province, where the climate is warm, afforestation work has been completed ahead of schedule. The afforestation area in the province has reached 910,000 mu, exceeding the planned afforestation task by 80%. Afforestation work in Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces is still continuing.
