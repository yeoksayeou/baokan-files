Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 7th: The American invading army and its puppet Rhee forces have intensified small-scale military activities on the front lines. In the last five days of April, they launched twenty incursions against us, but each time they were defeated under the heavy blows of the Korean-Chinese People's Forces.

    In the eastern part of the central sector, fierce mountain warfare has been taking place for days. On April 27th, an enemy reinforced platoon, under the cover of seven tanks, invaded the area east of Kimhwa, and was immediately and heroically repulsed by a unit of our army. The enemy then reinforced its troops to a company and attacked again, but was still repulsed. In this battle, our army killed or wounded more than 100 enemy soldiers. In the morning of the 28th, the enemy again attacked a high ground southeast of Kimhwa with two platoons, and was repulsed twice by our fierce firepower. Soon after, the enemy reinforced two more platoons to fiercely attack the high ground. Our defending troops calmly resisted and repulsed many enemy assaults. Later, the enemy gathered two companies of troops in the nearby mountains, attempting to continue their attack on us. After our artillery units discovered this enemy force, they suddenly bombarded it with dense artillery fire, scattering the enemy in disarray. In this day's battle, our army killed or wounded more than 150 enemy soldiers. In the area west of Mundung-ni, a unit of our army also continuously repulsed several enemy incursions, killing or wounding more than 140 enemy soldiers.

    On the eastern front, an artillery unit of our army destroyed two enemy tanks in the Sandae-ri area on the 27th.

    朝中人民部队继续击退敌军小规模进犯
    【新华社朝鲜前线七日电】美国侵略军及其李伪军在前线加强小规模的军事活动，在四月份的最后五天中共向我进犯二十次，但每次都在朝中人民部队的沉重打击下败退。
    在中线东部地区，连日发生激烈的山地战。四月二十七日，敌军一个加强排在七辆战车掩护下进犯金城以东地区，当即被我军某部英勇击退。接着敌军增兵至一个连重新进攻，但结果仍被击退，这次战争，我军共毙伤敌军一百多名。二十八日早晨，敌军又以两个排向金城东南某高地进犯，连续两次冲锋，都被我猛烈火力击退。不久，敌军又增兵两个排向该高地猛犯。我守军沉着抗击，打退敌军多次冲锋。后来，敌军又在附近山地集结了两个连的兵力，企图继续向我进攻。我军炮兵部队发现这股敌军后，即以密集炮火突然轰击，打得敌军四散溃逃。这天战斗，我军共毙伤敌军一百五十多名。在文登里以西地区，我军某部也连续击退敌军数次进犯，杀伤敌军一百四十多名。
    东线我军某部炮兵部队，二十七日在沙汰里地区击毁敌军战车两辆。
