    Persisting with Newspaper Readings for a Year Has Improved Our Understanding of Current Events

    Editor: Last year, when the first current affairs quiz was held in Beijing's secondary schools, more than one-third of the students in our Senior Three class at Beijing No. 1 Middle School failed. In the citywide secondary school current affairs quiz at the end of April this year, no one in our class failed, and 50% scored over 80. This is the result of persisting with newspaper reading and study for the past year.

    Under the leadership of the school's Current Affairs and Policy Study Committee, and with the student union and the Youth League cadres of the class as the core, we formed a current affairs and policy study cadre group of seven people, specifically responsible for newspaper reading. The cadre group determines the content of the newspaper reading based on the school's current affairs study center and the ideological situation of the students in the class, then selects relevant materials and drafts a newspaper reading outline. Because the preparation work is done well, the purpose of each newspaper reading is very clear, and the effect is very good. The way of reading the newspaper is very flexible, based on the principle of suiting the students' understanding ability and preferences. For example, when talking about the Jingjiang flood diversion and the Huai River control project, we first drew charts to illustrate the problem through the charts. Sometimes we also use dialogue or question-and-answer methods to solve some of the students' problems in current affairs study in a timely manner.

    Under the leadership of the study cadre group, the students' interest in current affairs study has increased, and they know more about the issues. Wang Yiwen, who repeatedly failed the tests in the past, now scores more than 80 points each time. In order to strengthen current affairs study, we also stipulate that a current affairs quiz should be held every two weeks, so that students can take this opportunity to review the current affairs issues of the past half month.

    During the "Three-Anti" Movement, our current affairs study was carried out in coordination with the school's "Three-Anti" Movement. Therefore, our newspaper reading activities also have a great auxiliary effect on the teaching work of teachers. The school is also very concerned about our newspaper reading activities and provides assistance at any time.

    Now, newspaper reading activities have been carried out throughout the school. We believe that through newspaper reading work, every student in the school can develop the habit of paying attention to current affairs and reading newspapers.

### 一年来坚持讲报的办法提高了我们对时事的认识

    一年来坚持讲报的办法提高了我们对时事的认识
    编辑同志：去年北京市中等学校举行第一次时事测验时，我们北京市第一中学高三全班有三分之一以上的同学不及格。今年四月底又参加全市中等学校时事测验，我们全班没有一个人不及格，而且百分之五十都在八十分以上。这是一年来坚持讲报学习的收获。
    我们在学校里的时事政策学习委员会领导下，以班的学生会和青年团的干部为核心，由七个人组成时事政策学习干事组，专门担任讲报工作。干事组根据全校的时事学习中心和本班同学们的思想情况，确定讲报的内容，然后选择有关材料，拟定讲报提纲。由于准备工作做得好，每次讲报的目的性都非常明确，效果很好。讲报的方式很灵活，以适合同学们的理解能力和爱好为原则。比如：讲荆江分洪和治淮工程时，就先画出图表，通过图表来说明问题。我们有时又采用对话或问答的方式，及时解决同学们在时事学习中的一些问题。
    在学习干事组的领导下，同学们对时事学习的兴趣提高了，知道的问题也多了，过去多次测验总是不及格的王一文，现在每次都考八十多分。为了加强时事学习，我们并规定每两周举行一次时事测验，同学们借这个机会，可以把半个月的时事问题作一次总的复习。
    在“三反”运动中，我们的时事学习是配合着学校的“三反”运动进行的。因此，我们的讲报活动对教师的教学工作，也有很大的辅助作用。学校也非常关心我们的讲报活动，并随时给予帮助。
    现在，讲报活动已在全校开展起来了。我们相信：通过讲报工作，可以使全校每个同学都养成关心时事和阅读报纸的习惯。
