To the other group of our People's Liberation Army elder brothers marching towards the Kang-Tibetan Plateau, with unparalleled fortitude and determination, who have crossed the Meili Snow Mountain and are heading towards the frontier of our motherland. They have made an ironclad vow: "To advance victoriously to the frontier of the motherland with a fighting stance, and to strive for the consolidation of national defense and the construction of a new Tibet!" They have crossed high mountains of five to six thousand meters above sea level, waded through turbulent rivers, overcome all difficulties, and successfully completed the great task of advancing to the frontier of the motherland. Crossing snow mountains of several thousand meters is an extremely arduous and difficult task. Sometimes, these hardships and difficulties are even more severe than what we encountered on the Korean battlefield. On the Korean battlefield, we fought against fierce artillery fire, but their advance into Tibet required fighting against the endless obstacles of nature.

On the Kang-Tibetan Plateau, snow accumulates year-round. Last August, the sun was visible for only three days in the entire month. In September, there were only eight sunny days. The Tibetan compatriots even said: "This is the blessing of Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army, such good weather is rare." The air on the high mountains is thin, making even breathing difficult, often causing people to gasp for air. On the mountaintop, a person's pulse rate often increases sharply to 150 beats per minute (normal is 70 to 80 beats per minute). Cooking rice is also often difficult; boiling a pot of water sometimes takes two or three hours. The mountains are a vast expanse of white, and some comrades' eyes have become blurred. Cultural instructor Comrade Wu Zhengjian, even after one of his eyes was blinded by the snow, continued to work tirelessly, and even helped the soldiers carry grain, earning the glorious title of model worker. We can understand the difficulty of the road from the following words: The Tibetan compatriots say: "January, February, March, the snow seals the mountains. April, May, June, soaked through. July, August, September, good for walking. October, November, December, crawl like a dog." This means that only July, August and September are good for walking. From October to December, the snow seals the mountains, making walking extremely difficult. The mountain roads are full of ice and snow, and a thick layer of ice forms on the soles of shoes after walking only a short distance, which the comrades call "wearing high heels." Along the way, the population is sparse. In the five hundred li distance from Meili Snow Mountain to Zuxiula Mountain, there are only the two small villages of Mengong and Zhuwagen, with a total of only eight households. Therefore, eating, drinking, and lodging became problems along the way. At that time, remnants of the enemy in Yanjing were still stubbornly resisting, and they had boasted: "The Meili Snow Mountain is a natural bunker, let alone the People's Liberation Army, even a bird would find it difficult to fly over." But our heroes overcame all difficulties from the mountaintops where birds could not fly, and achieved victory. In the advance of a certain unit towards Yanjing, they marched on the snow mountain for two days and one night. It snowed on the mountain and rained at the foot of the mountain. The cotton-padded clothes and hats of the comrades were often soaked through and frozen into ice, but they did not complain about the cold. The tents they stayed in were large on the outside and small on the inside. When it stopped snowing outside, it was still snowing inside, freezing hard and shiny, but they did not complain about the hardship. They even composed a quick-rhythm song: "Wearing a glazed hat, dressed in a glass coat, a birch bark bed, living in a fairy cave." The tents were set up on a small piece of snow ground leveled on the hillside, and the ground looked like it was paved with a large white marble slab. How did the soldiers describe eating? They said, "The chopsticks get thicker the more you eat, and the rice bowl gets smaller the more you eat." Indeed, it was often the case that the rice would turn into ice while they were eating. There were so many difficulties, so how did the heroes overcome them? They fought the difficulties with a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary optimism, demonstrating unparalleled majestic power. They said: "The road is not longer than our legs, the mountain is not higher than our insteps, the mountain is not bigger than our determination." They used this perseverance and determination to overcome the difficulties. The follow-up logistics units needed to build a large bridge 14-zhang (approx. 46 meters) long to transport grain to the front-line troops. A certain engineering unit of the Yunnan Military Region accepted the task of building the bridge. The river was wide, the current was rapid, and the river was often churning with waves more than 3 meters high. The Tibetan compatriots all said: "This river has never had a bridge built since the beginning of time. The water is deep and the waves are rapid; even if you put a large stone in, it will be washed away far!" A certain engineer also added: "A suspension bridge or iron cable bridge must be built. Without cranes or bridge-building machines, it is impossible with only a few axes and hammers."

However, the soldiers made a vow. They responded to the call of the Party, knowing that if the bridge was not built well, the grain could not be transported, and if the grain was not transported, the victory of the troops in front could not be guaranteed. Therefore, they put forward the resounding slogan: "Learn from the heroes on the Korean battlefield who repaired the 'unbreakable bridge'!" They displayed unparalleled wisdom. Without cranes or bridge-building machines, they used only wood, axes, hammers, and their hands to build the first bridge in the history of the ×× River. At the beginning, there were many difficulties. Just hauling the lumber alone was a problem, since the bridge required trees more than an arm's length in diameter and more than 20 meters long. Hauling such long trees to the riverbank was a challenge. A company used ropes as thick as eggs to haul for a whole morning, but they only managed to move the trees five or six zhang (approx. 17-20 meters). The company commander thought: "This won't do." So, the company held a branch meeting and called on everyone to find a solution. After mass discussion, they came up with the idea of placing logs underneath the trees to serve as rollers, "scratching" the trees on both sides with levers, shouting slogans, and singing songs. Soon, they hauled hundreds of large trees to the riverbank. Party member Wang Yude was hit in the stomach by a stone rolling down from the mountain while hauling trees. He was seriously injured. The comrades wanted him to go down and rest, but he said: "We are at a critical juncture in the mission, I cannot go down no matter what. I cannot do heavy work with my injury, but I can do lighter work." He sacrificed himself in this way. This spirit encouraged everyone.

The ground for the bridge piers needed to be leveled by blasting the jumbled piles of large stones. When the explosives they brought ran out, they used shovels to chip away at the stones bit by bit. Feng Jiayou, a soldier from the third platoon, said: "The stone is hard, but my determination is even harder." Many blisters appeared on his hands, and his body was also cracked from the vibrations, but he finally persevered until the bridge piers were leveled.

The trees were hauled, and the bridge piers on both sides were leveled. How could they be erected in the middle of the river? As a result, the soldiers came up with the idea of erecting them layer by layer from both sides to the middle. For the bridge planks in the middle, they used a zip line, tying it high on one side and low on the other, with a large knot in the middle. They tied the bridge plank to the high end and slid it towards the middle. When it reached the knot, it stopped and was placed on the wood erected on the other side. Thus, the task of building the bridge was successfully completed.

The logistics regiment set up grain stations at the 5,000-meter-high Meili Snow Mountain to transport grain to the front. The climate was so cold that they wore leather coats in July, and the road was so long and difficult to walk that grain transporters ate 40 pounds of grain en route to deliver one pound to the destination. Comrades, think about how many difficulties there were in this process? In the mountains, it was windy and snowy all day long, covered in thick fog, and the air was thin. It often felt like a rope was tied around the neck, and the head was dizzy and painful. After eating, the stomach was bloated and painful. They could only drink some yak butter and spicy soup every night. The livestock were also given four ounces of yak butter every week. The snow stung their eyes, and they couldn't sleep. They could only sleep for four hours a day, and sometimes they would stop breathing while sleeping. But in this arduous task of transporting grain, many heroes and role models emerged. Liang Longfu was tall and had big feet. The shoes issued to him were too small and could not be worn, so he carried grain barefoot on the ice and snow. His feet were frozen and cracked with an opening of an inch wide, but he still wrapped them in rags and limped along, carrying his load. Zhang Zhencheng, the squad leader of the tenth squad of the seventh company, once carried four bags (60 pounds each, a total of 240 pounds). The comrades called him an old ox, and he smiled and said: "I want to serve the people with the spirit of an old ox." Once, a string of eight pack animals rolled down the mountain ditch. The soldier Wu Sanyuan saw this and followed them down, carrying up the one or two hundred pounds of cargo. At this time, his hands were frozen stiff, but he used his fists to plug the broken rice bags and continued to move forward. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, everyone participated in carrying grain. Zhou Guangyue, a sixteen-year-old female comrade from the club, also carried a bag of 60 pounds of grain over the top of the mountain. The Youth League Committee asked the comrades if they were suffering? They all replied: "The Volunteer Army is fighting hard on the Korean battlefield to strike at the enemy. Our suffering is nothing."

In that vast expanse of white snow mountains, the livestock lacked grass to eat, so the soldiers had to cut bamboo leaves to feed the livestock. Bamboo leaves were not found all over the mountains, and the comrades burrowed into the wet forests, often breaking their fingers and tearing their cotton clothes to shreds. After accepting this arduous task, the combat squad of the seventh company folded 50,460 jin (25,230 kg) of bamboo leaves in 35 days, ensuring the animals' food supply. Since then, at the 1951 company-wide commendation meeting, they were gloriously selected as the "Heroic Grass-Cutting Squad."

In the harsh environment, the heroes not only completed their tasks, but also cared for and cherished the property of the motherland's people at all times. The feeder, Huang Bingfa, did not spill a single grain when feeding the livestock, and picked up even the grains that the livestock had scattered. In three or four months, he saved a total of more than ten jin (5 kg) of feed, and even picked out the undigested grass from the horse manure, washed it, and fed it to the livestock again. There were also comrades in the blacksmith squad who studied technology and figured out the knack of "flat and smooth nails, deep nail slots, and the deeper you punch, the more durable it is." The horseshoes they made were both strong and economical. Generally, they could only be used for more than a month, but the ones they made could be used for three months. They also created the method of "one furnace, two anvils," which greatly saved a sum of charcoal. So, they composed a quick-rhythm song: "Difficulties are just afraid of people with a heart, pay attention to the heat, one furnace, two anvils is a wonder, saving both coal and labor." Thanks to their efforts, they saved 20,000 jin (10,000 kg) of charcoal and more than 3,000 jin (1,500 kg) of raw iron in the 18,000 horseshoes they made. The comrades in the blasting team also put forward the resounding slogan of "five cubic meters of blasting with one pound of explosives" and "the stone is Truman." Because they used their brains to think of solutions, they blasted 736 cubic meters of stone with only 80 pounds of explosives, saving 66 pounds of explosives for the motherland, equivalent to more than 10 million yuan.

In this way, they used their strong perseverance and hard work to overcome difficulties and successfully completed the glorious task of entering and aiding Tibet.

How enthusiastically the people of Tibet welcome and support the People's Liberation Army elder brothers! They had suffered deeply from the oppression of imperialism and domestic reactionaries. But the people's army brought them happiness, helped them study, and even carried water, picked up manure, and harvested crops. They were amazed at how these people were able to transport grain from the other side of the Meili Snow Mountain! They admired how these people were able to build such a large bridge over such a wide river! They said: "The Communist Party's Mamu (Mamu is a Tibetan word, meaning army) is stronger than gods, simply heavenly soldiers."

Let the people praise this heroic army forever! Let the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries tremble before the miracles created by this heroic army! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the people's army will forever bravely advance for the liberation of the Tibetan people and to defend the sacred frontier of the motherland. In front of them, there are no insurmountable difficulties and no invincible enemies! Great elder brothers - the People's Liberation Army, we salute you!

    向进军在康藏高原上的英雄部队致敬
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团西南分团
    向祖国的康藏高原进军的另一支解放军老大哥们，以无比坚强的毅力和决心，翻过了梅里雪山，走向祖国的边疆。他们发出了铁一般的誓言：“要以战斗的姿态，胜利地挺进祖国的边疆，为巩固国防，建设新西藏而努力。”他们翻过了拔海五六千公尺的高山，涉过了水势湍急的大河，克服了一切困难，胜利地完成了挺进祖国边疆的伟大任务。翻过几千公尺的大雪山，是一件十分艰苦和困难的事。这些艰苦和困难，有时候是比我们在朝鲜战场所遭遇的还要严重。我们在朝鲜战场是与猛烈的炮火作斗争，他们进军西藏却要与无穷无尽的自然界的障碍进行战斗。
    在康藏高原，终年积雪，去年八月，一个月只有三天见到太阳的出现。九月一整月才有八天晴天。藏胞们还说：“这是毛主席和解放军的洪福，难得的好天气。”高山上空气稀薄，连呼吸都感到困难，常常使人喘不过气来。到山顶上，有人的脉搏急骤增加到每分钟一百五十次（正常人为每分钟七十到八十次）。饭也常煮不熟，烧一锅水，有的时候需要两三个钟头。山上白茫茫的一片，有些同志们的眼睛也发花了。文化教员吴正坚同志，一只右眼让雪刺瞎了，仍然不停的工作，还要帮助战士扛粮，获得了模范工作者的光荣称号。路难走的情形，我们听了下面的几句话，就可以了解一些了，藏胞说：“一二三，雪封山。四五六，淋得透。七八九，正好走。十冬腊，学狗爬。”这就是说一年中只有七八九三个月好走，到十冬腊月雪一封山，走路就异常困难了。山路尽是冰雪，走不多远鞋底上就结上很厚的冰，同志们管这叫做“穿高跟鞋”。沿路，人烟稀少，在梅里雪山到祖秀马拉山五百里的路程中，只有门工和竹瓦根两个小村庄一共还只有八家人家。所以沿路吃、喝、住都成了问题。当时盐井还有残余敌人在负隅顽抗，他们曾经吹过这样的大话：“梅里雪山是天然的碉堡，别说解放军，就是一只鸟也难飞过来。”但我们的英雄们就从鸟飞不过的山顶上克服了万难，取得了胜利。某部向盐井的进军中，在雪山上行进了两天一夜，山上下雪，山下下雨，同志们的棉衣帽子常常淋的透湿，结成了冰，也不叫冷；住的帐篷外边大了、里边小了，外边不下了，里边还在下，冻的又硬又亮，也不喊苦。他们还编了快板唱道：“头戴琉璃帽，身穿玻璃衣，铺的桦树皮，住的神仙洞。”帐篷是搭在半山坡上铲平的一小块雪地上，地上好像铺了一块白色的大理石一样。战士们形容吃饭，怎么说呢？他们说：“筷子越吃越粗，饭碗越吃越小。”确实是这样的，常常吃着吃着，连饭都成了冰块了。困难是这么多，英雄们是怎样战胜困难的呢？他们以高度的爱国主义和革命的乐观主义的精神和困难搏斗，表现出无比雄伟的力量。他们说：“路长没有我们的大腿长，山高没有我们的脚面高，山大还没有我们的决心大。”他们，就是用这种毅力和决心战胜困难的。后续的辎重部队为前边的部队运粮食，需要架一座十四丈长的大桥，云南军区工兵某部，接受了架桥的任务。河面宽，水流急，河里经常翻腾着一丈多高的大浪，藏胞们都说：“这条河自从开天辟地以来都没有架过桥，水又深，浪又急，放进一块大石头还要冲多远哩！”某工程师也接着说：“必须修吊桥或铁索桥，这没有起重机架桥机，光凭几把斧头锤子，不可能。”
    但是，战士们却发下了心愿，他们响应了党的号召，架不好桥，粮食运不过去，粮不运过去，就不能保证前边部队胜利地完成任务，于是他们提出了响亮的口号：“向朝鲜战场上抢修‘炸不断的桥’的英雄们看齐！”他们发挥了无比的智慧，没有起重机，也没有架桥机，只用木料，斧头，锤子，和双手架成了在××河上历史上的第一座大桥。开始，困难是很多的。光就拉木料来说，这桥须要一抱多粗的六丈多长的大树才行。那么长的树拉到河边去也就成了问题。一个连用鸡蛋那么粗的绳子拉了一早晨，还只拉五六丈远。他们的连长想道：“这不行。”于是连里召开了支部大会，号召大家想办法。经过群众的讨论，他们想出了在大树底下垫上滚木，两边用杠子“挠”着，喊着口号，唱着歌，很快就把几百根大树拉到河边去了。党员王玉德，在拉树时被山上滚下来的石头扎中了肚子，伤势很重，同志们要他下去休息，他说：“正在任务紧急的关头，我怎样也不下去，受了伤，重活不能干，做轻的。”就这样，他牺牲了。这种精神鼓舞了大家。
    奠桥基的地，需要把杂乱堆积的大石头炸平，带的炸药用完了，他们就用铁铲一铲一铲的把石头敲碎，三排一个战士冯家有说：“石头硬，我的决心比它还硬。”手上打了许多血泡，身上也震的裂了口子，终于坚持到把桥基打平。
    树也拉来了，两头桥基也打平了，怎么往河中间架呢？结果战士们想出了从两头一层压一层的往中间架的办法，当中的桥板，用一根溜索，一边高一边低地系在两岸，中间打一个大结，把桥板系在高的一头往中间溜，溜到有结的地方，就停止了搭在那一头架好的木料上。于是架桥的任务胜利地完成了。
    辎重团往前边运粮食，在五千多公尺高的梅里雪山上设立运粮站，气候是那么冷，七月天就穿上了皮大衣，路又是那么远，那么难走，途中运粮人吃掉四十斤粮食，才能运到目的地一斤。同志们想想看，这当中有多少困难？大山中，整天是风雪漫天，浓雾密罩，空气稀薄，脖子常常像是有绳子勒着一样，头脑也晕痛。吃过饭后肚子又胀又痛。只好每晚喝些酥油，辣汤。牲口也每星期给灌四两酥油。大雪刺得眼痛，睡不着觉。每天只能睡上四个钟头，有时睡着睡着就没气了。但在这种艰苦的运粮中，却涌现出了不少的英雄模范：梁隆富个儿大脚也大，发的鞋子嫌小不能穿，他就打赤脚在冰雪上扛粮，把脚冻裂了一寸来宽的口子，但仍用破布包了一拐一拐扛着跑。七连十班长张镇成，一次扛四包（一包是六十斤，共二百四十斤），同志们喊他是老牛，他笑着说：“我就要像老牛的精神一样来为人民服务。”有一次，八匹牲口一连串的滚下了山沟，战士吴三元一看也跟着溜下去，把一二百斤的驮子给扛上来。这时，手已经冻得伸不开，但他却用拳头塞着跌破的米袋，继续前进。为了提前完成任务，所有的人都参加了扛粮。俱乐部一位十六岁的小女同志周光月，也扛了六十斤一包的粮翻过了山顶。团委问同志们苦不苦呀？他们都答道：“志愿军在朝鲜战场上艰苦奋斗，打击敌人，我们吃点苦不算什么。”
    在那白茫茫一片的雪山中，牲口吃的草非常缺乏，战士们只好割竹叶来喂牲口。竹叶也不是漫山遍野都有的，同志们钻在湿树林子里，往往手指折出血来，棉衣撕得稀烂。七连的战斗班，接受了这个艰苦的任务后，全班在三十五天中折了五万零四百六十斤竹叶，保证了牲口的吃食。自此在一九五一年全团的评功会上，光荣地选为“割草英雄班”。
    英雄们在艰苦的环境中，不但完成了任务，而且时时刻刻，都在关心和爱护着祖国人民的财产，饲养员黄炳发给牲口喂料时一粒也不撒，把牲口撒下的还一粒粒的拾起来，三四个月中，总共节约了十几斤料，并且还把马粪里没有消化的草一根一根拣出来，洗干净后，再喂牲口。还有铁工排的同志，他们钻研技术，摸着了“掌裹平光钉槽深，多冲一分耐一分”的窍门，打的马掌又牢又省钱。一般只能用一个多月，他们打的可用三个月。并创造“一炉二砧”的办法，大大的省了一笔木炭费。于是他们编了一个快板说：“难事就怕有心人，掌握火候要留神，一炉二砧是奇闻，又省炭来又省工。”在他们的努力下，在所打的一万八千个铁掌中，就节约了两万斤木炭和三千多斤毛铁。炸石组的同志们也提出了“一斤炸药五立方”“石头就是杜鲁门”的响亮口号。由于他们动脑子想办法，只用八十斤炸药就炸了七百三十六立方，为祖国节约了六十六斤炸药，相当于一千多万元。
    就这样，他们用坚强的毅力，刻苦的精神，战胜了困难，胜利地完成了光荣的进藏和援藏的任务。
    西藏的人民，多么热烈地欢迎和拥护解放军老大哥呵！他们曾身受过帝国主义及国内反动派的压迫。人民军队却给他们带去了幸福，帮助他们学习，以至担水、拾粪、收割。他们惊异这些人怎么能从梅里雪山的那一边运来了粮食！他们佩服这些人怎么能在那样宽的河上架起那么大的桥来！他们说：“共产党的马木（马木是藏胞语言，就是军队的意思）比神人还强，简直是天兵天将。”
    让人民永世赞美这支英雄的部队吧！让帝国主义者和国民党反动派在这支英雄部队所创造的奇迹面前发抖吧！在毛主席和共产党领导下的人民军队，为了西藏人民的解放，为了捍卫祖国神圣的边疆，他们永远勇敢地前进。在他们面前，没有克服不了的困难，没有打不败的敌人！伟大的老大哥——解放军，我们向你们致敬！
