Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Soviet Trade Union Delegation, invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend the May Day celebrations in China, is about to leave Beijing to return home. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters held a tea party on the afternoon of the 27th to bid them farewell. Zhukov, the representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in China, was also invited to attend. Those present included: Wu Yuzhang, Shen Junru, and Huang Yanpei, vice presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, Qian Junrui, secretary-general, and more than 70 directors in Beijing.

The tea party began with a speech by Wu Yuzhang, who, on behalf of the 23 million members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, expressed his farewell to the Soviet Trade Union Delegation.

Then, the head of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation, Shevchenko, delivered a reply amidst warm applause. He spoke freely about his impressions and observations of visiting New China. He said that the representatives saw the high political and labor enthusiasm of the workers in the May Day demonstration and visits to various cities, and also saw the rising political enthusiasm of the peasants in the countryside. It is precisely because the people of all strata across the country have such enthusiasm that the Resist America, Aid Korea movement can be widely and enthusiastically carried out throughout the country. Shevchenko also said: Wherever we have been, we are deeply convinced that the Chinese people have a very strong spirit of internationalism. They are striving for world peace and eagerly hoping to be friendly with the people of all countries. He said that the words "Soviet representatives" were always on the lips of the tens of thousands of working people who came to welcome the representatives. When Soviet Trade Union Delegation member Busuyev performed high-speed cutting methods in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places, representatives of workers from dozens of enterprises came to visit. The workers sincerely thanked Busuyev and asked him to thank the Soviet elder brother for their assistance to the Chinese people. Finally, Shevchenko, on behalf of all the members, thanked the Chinese people for their warm and fraternal hospitality, and wished the Chinese trade unions further achievements in consolidating the cause of the People's Republic of China.

Busuyev, a high-speed lathe operator from the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory and a member of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation, also delivered a speech at the meeting. He described how he demonstrated high-speed cutting technology in factories in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places, and received a warm welcome from Chinese workers. He finally wished the Chinese working class new achievements on the production front.

Qian Junrui spoke at the meeting at the end, expressing his gratitude for the visit of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation. He pointed out that the visit of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation to New China has promoted the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

The tea party proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Finally, the Soviet Trade Union Delegation received the constitution of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters and the commemorative badge of the First National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held three consecutive seminars on the 27th with trade union representatives from Vietnam, India, Australia, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries who were invited to China to attend the May Day celebrations.
