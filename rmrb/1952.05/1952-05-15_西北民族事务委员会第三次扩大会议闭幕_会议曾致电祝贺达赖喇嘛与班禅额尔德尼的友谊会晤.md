Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 11th - The Third (Enlarged) Meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Nationalities Affairs Commission, held on May 2nd, successfully concluded on the 7th after six days. This meeting summarized the achievements and experiences of the Northwest region's ethnic work over the past three years and focused on discussing the issue of promoting ethnic regional autonomy. In addition to the members of the Northwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, representatives of various ethnic minorities, representatives of ethnic autonomous region people's governments at or above the county level, ethnic work cadres from various provinces (cities), and representatives from relevant departments in the Northwest region, totaling 116 people, attended the meeting. Xi Zhongxun and Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairmen of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and Zhang Zongxun, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military Region, attended the meeting to provide guidance.

Over the past three years, governments at all levels in the Northwest region have correctly implemented ethnic policies, and ethnic work has made great achievements. More than 3,000 ethnic disputes have been mediated throughout the region, including some cases that had not been resolved for decades or even hundreds of years. Ethnic democratic united governments have been widely established in various places, with 11 autonomous regions already established at the district and county level, and another Yushu Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province, a Tibetan area equivalent to a special district. Nearly 30,000 minority cadres have been trained throughout the region to participate in government work, and some have become leading backbone members in local government work. In addition, ethnic minority areas have also made significant achievements in trade, culture and education, health, and the restoration and development of production.

In order to take care of the special circumstances of ethnic minority areas, the meeting made several provisions on some specific issues of ethnic work in the region. The attending committee members, ethnic workers, and ethnic representatives unanimously believed that these provisions were fully in line with the actual conditions of the Northwest region and conducive to ethnic unity. Ethnic workers from various places reported on the achievements and experiences of ethnic work in their respective regions at the meeting; representatives from various autonomous regions talked about their happy lives under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government after the establishment of their autonomous region people's governments, and put forward many opinions and requirements regarding the development of their ethnic groups' economy, culture, health, and other undertakings.

The meeting carefully studied the relevant documents on ethnic regional autonomy and conducted in-depth discussions. Wang Feng, Chairman of the Northwest Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in summarizing the experience of promoting ethnic regional autonomy in the Northwest region: Actively and extensively training minority cadres is the key to doing all ethnic work well and the central link in promoting ethnic regional autonomy. He pointed out that to further promote ethnic regional autonomy, it is necessary to overcome all kinds of great-Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, and correct all incorrect understandings in the implementation of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. The promotion of ethnic regional autonomy must adhere to a cautious and steady policy; on the one hand, we must be bold and let go, and on the other hand, we must be serious and cautious, and not be impatient.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th - The Third Enlarged Meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Nationalities Affairs Commission sent a telegram on May 7th to congratulate the friendly meeting between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni. The telegram is as follows: To the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni:

As the Third Enlarged Meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Nationalities Affairs Commission is being held, we are delighted to hear that the Panchen Erdeni has safely arrived in Lhasa and had a friendly meeting with the Dalai Lama. We hereby send our congratulations. We sincerely hope that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, you will unite closely and strive to implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, consolidate the Southwest national defense, and build a new Tibet.

    西北民族事务委员会第三次扩大会议闭幕
    会议曾致电祝贺达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼的友谊会晤
    【新华社西安十一日电】西北军政委员会民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议在五月二日举行，历时六天，已于七日胜利闭幕。这次会议总结了西北地区三年来民族工作的成绩和经验，并着重地讨论了推行民族区域自治问题。出席这次会议的除西北民族事务委员会各委员外，还有各少数民族代表、县级以上民族自治区人民政府代表和各省（市）民族工作干部，和西北区各有关部门的代表，共一百一十六人。西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋、张治中和西北军区副司令员张宗逊都到会指导。
    三年来，西北区各级人民政府，正确执行了民族政策，民族工作有很大成绩。全区调解了三千多件民族纠纷，其中有的纠纷案是几十年甚至几百年来都未能获得解决的问题。各地普遍建立了民族民主联合政府，已经建立的约相当于区、县一级的自治区有十一个，另外青海省还有一个相当于专区一级的藏族聚居的玉树自治区。全区已培养了近三万名少数民族干部参加了政权工作，他们有的已经成为当地政权工作中的领导骨干。此外，各少数民族地区在贸易、文化教育、卫生、恢复与发展生产方面，也有显著的成绩。
    为了照顾少数民族地区的特殊情况，这次会议曾就全区民族工作的一些具体问题，作出若干规定。到会委员、民族工作者、各民族代表一致认为这些规定是完全符合西北区实际情况和有利于民族团结的。各地民族工作者，都在会上报告了各该地区民族工作的成绩和经验；各自治区代表讲述了他们成立自治区人民政府后，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，过着幸福生活的情形，并提出了许多有关发展本民族经济、文化、卫生等事业的意见和要求。
    会议仔细地研究了民族区域自治的有关文件并进行了深入的讨论。西北民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋在总结西北区推行民族区域自治的经验中说：积极地大量地培养少数民族干部，这是作好一切民族工作的关键，也是推行民族区域自治的中心环节。他指出：进一步推行民族区域自治，必须克服各式各样的大民族主义与狭隘民族主义的思想残余，纠正在推行民族区域自治政策中一切不正确的认识。推行民族区域自治必须掌握慎重稳进的政策，一方面要大胆放手，一方面要严肃谨慎，不能急躁。
    【新华社西安九日电】西北军政委员会民族事务委员会第三次扩大会议，在五月七日致电祝贺达赖喇嘛与班禅额尔德尼的友谊会晤。电文如下：达赖喇嘛班禅额尔德尼先生：
    正当西北军政委员会民族事务委员会第三次扩大会议召开之际，欣闻班禅额尔德尼先生安抵拉萨，并与达赖喇嘛友谊会晤，特电祝贺。敬望在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，亲密团结，为实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，巩固祖国西南国防，建设新西藏而努力。
