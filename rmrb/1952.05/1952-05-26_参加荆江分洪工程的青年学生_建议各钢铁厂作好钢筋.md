    Youth Students Participating in Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project
    Suggest Steel Plants Improve Steel Bars
    Editor: We are a group of young students participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. Based on more than a month of on-site work experience, we would like to make the following suggestions to steel plants across the country:
    (1) The length and thickness of all steel bars should be standardized. The current steel bars vary in length, ranging from six meters to nineteen meters. The fracture rate of each type of steel bar is more than 10%. The same is true for the thickness of the steel bars. According to the standard, a one-inch steel bar weighs 3.98 kilograms per meter; however, the current steel bars are uneven in thickness, with some weighing only 3.8 kilograms per meter. Engineers design based on standard thickness, but these steel bars do not meet the standard, which greatly affects the quality of the project.
    (2) Do not allow substandard products to leave the factory. We have found that some steel bars have defects such as cracks, notches, splitting, and peeling. These steel bars are unusable. This results in a waste of transportation capacity and hinders the progress of the project.
    We believe that steel plants should pay attention to these issues to avoid losses of state property and hindering the construction of the project.

    参加荆江分洪工程的青年学生
    建议各钢铁厂作好钢筋
    编辑同志：我们是一群参加荆江分洪工程的青年学生。根据一个多月来的现场工作体验，我们向全国钢铁厂提出几点建议：
    （一）所有钢筋的长度、粗细应该作到标准化。现用钢筋的长短不齐，从六公尺到十九公尺的都有。每种钢筋的断头率都在百分之十以上。在钢筋的粗细上也是这样。依照标准，一吋钢筋每公尺重三点九八公斤；但现用的钢筋粗细不匀，有的每公尺只重三点八公斤。工程师设计时是按标准粗细计算的，这些钢筋却不合标准，大大影响了工程的质量。
    （二）不要让次品出厂。我们发现有些钢筋有龟裂、缺口、对开、剥皮等毛病，这些钢筋是不能用的。因此白白浪费了运输力，妨碍了工程的进展。
    我们认为各钢铁厂应注意这些问题，以免损失国家财产，妨碍工程的建筑。
