Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Dong Biwu, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society, issued a protest against the British government in Hong Kong's order to suspend publication of Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and the illegal sentencing of the newspaper's responsible persons:

Following the bloody atrocity of killing our residents on March 1, the British government in Hong Kong recently sentenced Hong Kong's Chinese people's "Ta Kung Pao" to a six-month suspension of publication on trumped-up charges. Fei Yimin, the owner and printer of the newspaper, was sentenced to nine months in prison, and editor Li Zongying was sentenced to six months of hard labor. We lodge a serious protest against this reactionary measure by the British government in Hong Kong.

This judgment by the British government in Hong Kong is completely illegal. The reason for accusing "Ta Kung Pao" and sentencing it is the hard-line claim that "Ta Kung Pao" published "inflammatory words" "involving" the British government in Hong Kong. However, "Ta Kung Pao" only published a short commentary from the Beijing "People's Daily" broadcast by the Xinhua News Agency of China protesting against British imperialism's killing of our residents, which did not involve any "incitement" at all. "Ta Kung Pao" has full legal rights to do so, and the judgment against it by the British government in Hong Kong is completely unfounded. The trial process has powerfully demonstrated that this is a complete frame-up and persecution.

This conspiracy concocted by the British government in Hong Kong is completely illegal even in terms of judicial procedure. The British government in Hong Kong did not even complete the legal procedures prescribed by the British themselves when filing charges and arresting the responsible persons of the three newspapers. All this proves that in order to achieve the political goal of persecuting Chinese residents, the British government in Hong Kong does not hesitate to destroy the judicial system and fabricate charges. This not only arouses the hatred of the entire Chinese people, but we in the Chinese political and legal circles especially feel that this is a serious insult to the dignity of the law, and we feel particularly indignant.

The great Chinese people will never sit idly by and ignore the British government in Hong Kong's illegal persecution of their beloved compatriots. We must sternly warn the British government in Hong Kong that if they continue to act arbitrarily in this way, they will inevitably suffer the consequences of their own actions.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Fan Changjiang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the China News Publication and Printing Trade Union, issued a statement protesting against the British government in Hong Kong's order to suspend publication of Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" for six months and the illegal sentencing of the newspaper's responsible persons. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao was ordered to suspend publication because it published a short commentary from the Beijing "People's Daily" protesting against the British government in Hong Kong's killing of Chinese residents. This is a serious crime by the British government in Hong Kong, which does not hesitate to use the most despicable means to destroy freedom of speech. I now lodge a serious protest on behalf of all Chinese journalists.

As a newspaper of the Chinese people, Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" has always faithfully reported the lives, work, struggles, and victories of the people of the motherland to the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, and has therefore been supported by the vast majority of residents in Hong Kong. However, the British government in Hong Kong, at the instigation of US imperialism, is deliberately trying to deprive the Chinese people in Hong Kong of their legitimate right to obtain news from the motherland, and deliberately trying to strangle "Ta Kung Pao" and other democratic newspapers in Hong Kong. This tyrannical behavior of the British government in Hong Kong is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Its attempt to prohibit the people of Hong Kong from hearing the voice of the people of the motherland will not be achieved. All Chinese journalists will do their utmost to support the struggle of Chinese journalists in Hong Kong against the persecution of the British government in Hong Kong. I now once again, on behalf of all Chinese journalists, warn the British government in Hong Kong that the persecution of "Ta Kung Pao" and the Chinese people's news undertakings in Hong Kong must be stopped, otherwise it must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    筹委会抗议香港英国政府非法迫害香港大公报
    【新华社八日讯】中国政治法律学会筹备会主席董必武顷为香港英国政府勒令香港“大公报”停刊并对该报负责人非法判刑一事发表抗议称：
    香港英国政府继三月一日捕杀我国居民的血腥暴行之后，竟又在最近以莫须有的罪名判决香港中国人民的“大公报”停刊六个月。该报所有人兼督印人费彝民被判处徒刑九个月，编辑李宗瀛被判处苦工六个月。我们对香港英国政府这种反动措施，提出严重的抗议。
    香港英国政府的这种判决是完全非法的。它控告“大公报”并据以判刑的理由是硬说“大公报”刊登了“涉及”香港英国政府的“煽动性文字”。但是，“大公报”只是刊登了中国新华通讯社所播发的北京“人民日报”抗议英帝国主义捕杀我国居民的短评，其中根本谈不上有什么“煽动”，“大公报”这样做是有充分合法的权利的，而香港英国政府对它的判决是完全没有根据的。审讯的过程已经有力地证明了这是彻头彻尾的诬告与陷害。
    香港英国政府布置出来的这一套阴谋即使在司法程序上也是完全非法的，香港英国政府在向三报负责人提出控告并加以逮捕时甚至没有完成英国人自己规定的法律手续。所有这一切都证明香港英国政府为了达到在政治上迫害中国居民的目的，不惜破坏司法制度而罗织入罪。这不仅引起全中国人民的痛恨，我们中国政治法律学界尤其感到这是对法律尊严的一个严重侮辱，格外感到愤慨。
    伟大的中国人民决不会对香港英国政府非法迫害自己亲爱的同胞的行为坐视不理。我们必须正告香港英国政府，他们如果还要这样一意孤行地做下去，就必然要自食恶果。
    【新华社七日讯】中国新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会主任范长江发表声明，抗议香港英国政府勒令香港“大公报”停刊六个月并对该报负责人非法判刑。声明全文如下：
    香港大公报因为刊载北京“人民日报”抗议香港英国政府捕杀中国居民的短评而被勒令停刊。这是香港英国政府不惜以最卑劣的手段摧残言论自由一个严重罪行。我现在代表全中国的新闻工作者对此提出严重的抗议。
    香港“大公报”作为中国人民的报纸，一贯忠实地向香港的中国同胞报道了祖国人民的生活与工作、斗争与胜利，因此受到香港广大居民的拥护。但是，香港英国政府竟在美帝国主义的唆使下蓄意要剥夺在香港的中国人民获得祖国消息的正当权利，蓄意要绞杀“大公报”以及香港其他的民主报纸。香港英国政府的这种横暴行为是中国人民所决不能容忍的。它要想禁止香港人民听到祖国人民的声音的企图是达不到的。全中国的新闻工作者一定竭尽全力，支持在香港的中国人民新闻工作者反抗香港英国政府迫害的斗争。我现在再一次代表中国全体新闻工作者向香港英国政府提出警告，对“大公报”以及在香港的中国人民新闻事业的迫害必须停止，否则它就必须对因此引起的严重后果负完全责任。
