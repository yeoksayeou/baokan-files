Visiting Chen Yongkang, a Model of High Rice Yield, and His Mutual Aid Team
By Our Correspondent Lu Sheng

Chen Yongkang, the nationally renowned model of high rice yield, lives in Chang'an Village, southeast of Songjiang County town in the Su Nan District, on the north bank of the Huangpu River. In early May, I went to Chang'an Village to visit him and his mutual aid team. Purple-pink red clover (vetch) grew in the paddy fields, emitting a fragrant scent. The small river flowed quietly around the paddy fields, and straw-built pavilions stood at intervals along the riverbank. Water buffalo pulled waterwheels in the pavilions, and water flowed from the dragon-bone waterwheels into the fertile paddy fields. We entered Chang'an Village through a bamboo garden. After an introduction by Hua Dinglin, a member of the village work team, I saw Chen Yongkang in the paddy fields outside the village. He was waving his whip, driving the oxen to harrow the fields. He told me that this was the high-yield field of their mutual aid team, and they had already plowed it three times and harrowed it four times. He said, "This year we are organized, and every field will be plowed four times and harrowed eight times."

Organized, Spring Plowing Done Well

Last year, Chen Yongkang was still a farmer who had not joined a mutual aid team. Last December, he attended the Su Nan District People's Representative Conference in Wuxi City and began to realize that only by organizing collective labor could the yield per unit area be comprehensively improved. Therefore, with the help of the local work team and the promotion of poor peasants, after mutual consultation and multiple discussions, in January of this year, he and poor peasants such as Gu Bolin formed a mutual aid team. Now the team has a total of seven male members and eleven female members, cultivating a total of 80 mu and 6 fen of land, including 56 mu and 8 li of paddy fields. After they organized the mutual aid team, they made greater achievements in spring repairs and sowing this year than last year, creating favorable conditions for completing the patriotic production increase competition plan this year.

In order to improve the soil and unleash its potential, they started spring plowing 20 days earlier this year (in the past, spring plowing only started after the summer solstice). To ensure that all the team's land was deeply plowed to seven inches (two inches deeper than last year), Chen Yongkang began to partially adopt new-style walking plows this year. It is expected that before transplanting, all the paddy fields can be plowed four times and harrowed eight times; among them, ten mu, two fen, and nine li of white-pan fields (i.e., fields with poor soil quality that cannot grow red clover) will be guaranteed to be plowed five times and harrowed nine times.

This year, they plan to apply an average of 1,000 jin of green manure, 1,500 jin of pig manure, 80 jin of bean cake, and 10 jin of fertilizer powder per mu of paddy field. To achieve the fertilization plan, before the Qingming Festival, they applied 5 jin of fertilizer powder per mu to 39 mu of red clover fields, so this year's red clover grew better than any previous year. The extra red clover harvested this year solved the green manure needs of six mu of white-pan fields. For the remaining four mu of white-pan fields, Chen Yongkang mobilized the women and children of the team to cut more than 20,000 jin of wild grass to supplement it.

This year, the whole team adopted Chen Yongkang's experience of "good seeds produce good seedlings, and good seedlings grow good rice" and prepared three suitable nursery fields. These three nursery fields were all plowed four times and harrowed eight times, and turned over with four-pronged forks; and all were sown using Chen Yongkang's "sparse sowing" method. The nursery fields were made better than any previous year. In order to prevent pests as early as possible, all the rice seeds this year were selected using salt water, and from now on, lights are lit every night next to the straw piles outside the nursery fields to attract moths, in order to kill rice borers as early as possible. In addition, in order to continue to do a good job in breeding good seeds, maintaining the purity of good seeds, and comparing good seeds, they all used the "Lao Lai Qing" rice seeds bred by Chen Yongkang using the "one ear uniform" method this year. In order to maintain the purity of good seeds, in addition to Chen Yongkang continuing to lead the breeding of one ear uniform "Lao Lai Qing" seeds, one mu of land was also set aside for a comparison test of the new variety "853".

A Day's Life

After Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team participated in initiating the national rice production increase competition, the production enthusiasm of all team members was very high. They started working at three o'clock every morning. As soon as it dawned, the male team members drove the oxen to plow the fields, and the female team members got up to cook breakfast. After breakfast, the male team members continued to plow the fields. The female team members had just fed the pigs when the tide came through the Huangpu River. Gu Jinxiu, the head of the women's team, and Chen Xiujuan called on the women with children to entrust their children to the elderly and gather at the straw pavilion to take turns pumping water. In the past, water was pumped here by water buffalo, but this year, in order to strive to complete the patriotic production increase competition plan, they let the water buffalo plow and harrow the paddy fields and used manpower to pump water. The labor of women in the mutual aid team is also very important. The tide comes through the Huangpu River twice a day, and they have to pump water twice a day. In addition, they also have to take time to feed the cattle and pigs. In the afternoon, the male team members returned home from the fields, and the people's school became lively. The female team members first lit moth-attracting lamps next to the straw piles by the nursery fields, and then took their literacy textbooks to the people's school to evaluate work and record work points with the male team members. Afterwards, the male team members and the comrades of the work team studied the techniques of plowing and harrowing the fields and planned the work for the next day, while the female team members started their cultural lessons.

Every day, they work so actively and live happily, taking a new road of organizing to develop agricultural production.

Breaking Ideological Concerns

The production enthusiasm of Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team, from the team leader to the team members, was not so high from the beginning. When they began to formulate the patriotic production increase plan, their confidence in increasing production was insufficient. At that time, Chen Yongkang's ideological concerns were: (1) fear of water and drought disasters that would reduce rice yields; (2) fear that working together with team members (especially the newly liberated poor peasants) would affect his personal ability to increase rice yields; (3) fear of having to bear more burdens after achieving high yields. Other team members also had ideological concerns. They were afraid of bearing more burdens, and also afraid that after mutual aid, they would use more labor and be unable to afford wages in rice; some people were also afraid of not having money to buy fertilizer. However, their desire to organize and improve production was very urgent.

After understanding this situation, the comrades of the work team tried to help Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team solve these problems in a timely manner. They believed that the main reason why Chen Yongkang had these concerns was that he had only buried himself in production in the past without asking about politics, and did not understand the people's government's production policies well enough; at the same time, because he was not facing difficulties in production in the past and now, and overestimated his own production technology, he could not see the power of the masses and did not realize the benefits of organizing for a while. To solve these ideological concerns of his, in addition to strengthening policy education for him, it was also necessary to use concrete facts to educate him constantly in the process of mutual aid. The comrades of the work team understood this and acted accordingly, and they achieved good results. For example, Chen Yongkang was afraid of being reduced in production due to water and drought disasters, which was something that many farmers had no way to avoid in the past. However, this year he organized a mutual aid team, and all the team members, in addition to taking the lead in participating in the county's river repair project, also dredged three old rivers and excavated three new canals in their village together with other people; the benefited paddy fields increased from more than 300 mu to 710 mu. At the same time, in order to avoid being flooded during high tides, they also repaired four weirs. In this way, their paddy fields this year can avoid waterlogging in floods and water shortages in droughts, which was impossible when working alone. For example, in the past, he personally made suitable nursery fields, and although his technology was very high, no matter how flat the nursery bed was made and how evenly the seeds were sown, it was inevitable that some grains would be washed away when water flowed into the nursery field, destroying his "sparse sowing" method. This year, with the joint labor and joint research of all team members, they came up with a reasonable watering method, which made the "sparse sowing" method more perfect. Regarding the concern that more grain harvested would lead to more burdens, the comrades of the work team used Chen Yongkang's own facts to educate him and everyone. After he achieved high yields last year, the government not only did not collect more public grain from him, but also rewarded him. After educating them with these facts, Chen Yongkang's ideological concerns began to be dispelled, and his confidence in increasing production gradually increased.

Experienced the Benefits of the Mutual Aid Team

Now, Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team has successfully completed spring repairs, sowing, and manure accumulation, and has begun spring plowing. After the initial experience of collective labor in mutual aid production during this period, when they summarized the production work in this stage (Note: their agricultural activities in a year are divided into five stages: the first stage is spring repairs and manure accumulation, and sowing in nursery fields; the second stage is spring plowing and transplanting, summer harvest and summer planting; the third stage is mid-season cultivation and weeding, applying topdressing fertilizer on time, rational irrigation, and pest and disease prevention; the fourth stage is autumn harvest (mainly rice) and autumn planting (planting wheat, rapeseed, and beans); the fifth stage is sideline production and repairing agricultural tools), they have begun to appreciate the benefits of organizing. They all happily said:

"Organizing is stronger than working alone!" Chen Yongkang also said: "Last year, when I worked alone, I had to do all the major jobs (technically demanding) and minor jobs (such as picking grass, digging stubble, and planting melons) myself. I couldn't take care of everything, so I couldn't concentrate all my energy on researching and improving farming techniques. This year, after organizing, all these minor jobs are done by the women. Last year, I personally made six fen of nursery fields. I had to do everything myself, including digging stubble, turning the soil, digging ditches, sowing seeds, irrigating, and fertilizing. As a result, it took me a week to finish. This year, the whole team made a total of four mu of suitable nursery fields. Because we are organized and can divide the work and cooperate, the women dig the stubble, the men turn the fields, someone manages the irrigation, and I specialize in sowing (because sowing requires the best technology). The nursery fields made this year not only saved labor, but also were made better than any previous year. Now I am beginning to realize the principle that organizing is stronger than working alone."

Political and Ideological Education Must Continue to Be Strengthened

There are currently two problems in Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team that need the attention and help of local leading organs:

First, ideological education on organizing collective production must continue. Chen Yongkang himself is a middle peasant, and his original desire to organize was very weak. When the comrades of the work team proposed to him to organize a mutual aid team, he said for a long time: "Take it slowly, take it slowly." In fact, at that time, he believed that organizing to increase production was not as guaranteed as working alone. Although he has now begun to experience the benefits of organizing in the process of collective labor, this is still far from enough. Local leading organs in the past did not pay enough attention to ideological education, but only paid attention to strengthening technical guidance to Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team, which is a big shortcoming. Currently, the Songjiang County leading organs have decided to strengthen political leadership over Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team, which is very necessary.

Second, the work team cadres should boldly let go and overcome the work style of taking over and doing everything. Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team has been established for more than four months, but until now, the cadres sent by the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Su Nan Administrative Office are still doing all the daily convening of meetings to evaluate work and record accounts. I have participated in their two work evaluation meetings, and the cadres asked questions, and Chen Yongkang and other team members answered, with very little discussion. Why should work points be evaluated in that way? And why should they be recorded in that way? The team members do not understand very well. In this way, they are dependent on the cadres. It is necessary to find ways to overcome this work style of taking over and doing everything, and to inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of all team members, in order to further consolidate the mutual aid team and further strengthen the patriotic production increase confidence of each team member.

    访水稻丰产模范陈永康和他的互助组
    本报记者  鲁生
    全国著名的水稻丰产模范陈永康，住在苏南区松江县城东南黄浦江北岸的长岸村。五月初，我到长岸村去访问他和他的互助组。稻田里生长着紫粉色的红花草（紫云英），散发出阵阵的清香。小河绕着稻田静静地流着，河岸上隔不多远就有一处用稻草搭成的凉亭，水牛在亭子里拉着水车，河水从龙骨水车里流进肥沃的稻田。我们通过竹园走进长岸村。经过驻村工作组的华鼎霖同志介绍，我在村外稻田里看到了陈永康。他正扬着鞭子，赶着牛耙田。他告诉我，这就是他们的互助组的丰产田，现在已经做到了耕三遍耙四遍。他说：“今年我们组织起来了，每块田都要做到耕四遍耙八遍。”
    组织起来春耕做得好
    陈永康去年还是一个没有参加互助组的农民。去年十二月，他在无锡市参加苏南区各界人民代表会议，开始认识到只有组织起来进行集体劳动，才能全面地提高单位面积产量。于是，他在当地工作组的帮助和贫农的推动下，经过互相商量和多次讨论，在今年一月，和贫农顾伯林等组成互助组。现在全组共有七个男组员，十一个女组员，共种八十亩零六分田，其中有五十六亩零八厘水稻田。他们组织了互助组以后，今年在春修和播种方面，都比去年做出了更大的成绩，给今年完成爱国增产竞赛计划创造了有利条件。
    为了改良土壤，发挥土壤的潜在能力，他们今年提早二十天开始了春耕（过去夏至后才开始春耕）。陈永康为使全组的土地都深耕到七寸（比去年深耕二寸），今年开始部分地采用了新式步犁。预计到插秧前，全部稻田可以做到四耕八耙；其中有十亩二分九厘白板田（即土质不好，不能长红花草的田）则保证做到五耕九耙。
    今年他们计划每亩稻田平均施绿肥一千斤、猪圈肥一千五百斤、豆饼八十斤、肥田粉十斤。为实现施肥计划，他们在清明节前，就在三十九亩红花草田中，每亩施用了五斤肥田粉，因此，今年的红花草比过去那一年都长得好。今年多收的红花草，解决了六亩白板田所需的绿肥问题。其余的四亩多白板田所需的绿肥，陈永康又发动全组妇女、儿童割了两万多斤野草来补足。
    今年全组采用陈永康“好种出好苗，好苗长好稻”的经验，做好了三块合式的秧田。这三块秧田都是经过四耕八耙，并用四股叉翻过的；并且全是采用陈永康“落谷稀”的播种办法播种的。秧田作得比那一年都好。为了及早防治虫害，今年的稻种全部用盐水选种，而且从现在起，每夜都在秧田外草堆旁点灯诱蛾，以便及早杀灭螟虫。此外，为了继续做好良种繁殖、良种保纯和良种对比的工作，他们今年全部采用陈永康用“一穗齐”的方法繁殖出来的“老来青”稻种。为了良种保纯，除由陈永康继续领导繁殖一穗齐“老来青”种外，还抽出一亩田作新品种“八五三”的对比试验。
    一天的生活
    陈永康互助组参加发起全国水稻增产竞赛后，全体组员生产情绪都很高。他们每天早上三点钟就开始劳动，天刚发亮，男组员就赶着牛去耕田，女组员也起来烧锅做早饭。饭后男组员继续耕田。女组员刚喂过猪，海潮就通过黄浦江来到了。妇女组长顾锦秀和陈秀娟号召有小孩的妇女，把孩子交给老人，齐集到稻草亭子里轮流车水。过去这里都是用水牛车水，今年她们为了争取完成爱国增产竞赛计划，就让水牛去耕耙稻田，用人力车水。妇女们在互助组内的劳动也是很重要的。海潮通过黄浦江每天要来潮两次，她们每天就要车两次水。此外，她们还要抽空喂牛喂猪。下午，男组员从田里回家了，这时民校里热闹起来。女组员先到秧田边草堆旁点起诱蛾灯，然后拿着识字课本，到民校里和男组员一块评工记工。以后，男组员和工作组的同志研究耕地耙田的技术和计划明天的工作，女组员就上起文化课来。
    他们每天就是这样积极地劳动着，愉快地生活着，走着一条组织起来发展农业生产的新道路。
    打破思想顾虑
    陈永康互助组从组长到组员的生产情绪，并不是一开始就这样高涨的。当他们开始订爱国增产计划时，他们的增产信心是不足的。当时陈永康的思想顾虑是：（一）怕遇到水旱灾，稻田会减产；（二）怕和组员们（特别是刚翻身的贫农）一齐生产，会影响他个人的稻子不能提高产量；（三）怕丰产后会多负担。其他组员们也有思想顾虑。他们怕多负担，还怕互助起来以后，多用了工，出不起工资米；有的人还怕没有钱买肥料。但是，他们对组织起来提高生产的要求是很迫切的。
    工作组的同志了解了这种情况以后，就设法帮助陈永康互助组及时解决这些问题。他们认为陈永康所以有这些顾虑，主要是因为他过去只是埋头生产不问政治，对人民政府的生产政策了解得不够；同时因为他过去和现在在生产上都不困难，而且过多地看重了自己的生产技术，看不见群众的力量，一时认识不到组织起来的好处。要解决他的这些思想顾虑，除应对他加强政策教育外，同时必须在互助的过程中经常拿具体事实来教育他。工作组的同志是这样认识也这样做了，他们得到了良好的效果。比如陈永康怕遭水灾旱灾减产，这是过去许多农民都没有办法避免的事情。但是，今年他组织了互助组，全体组员，除了带头参加全县的修河工程以外，又在本村和其他群众一起疏通了三条老河，开凿了三条新的水渠；使受益的稻田由原来的三百多亩增加到七百一十亩。同时，为了在大潮来时不受水淹，他们还培修好四处圩塘。这样，他们的稻田今年就可以做到涝不积水，旱不缺水，这是在单干时无论如何办不到的。又如过去他个人做合式秧田，技术虽然很高，但是秧板做得再平，落谷落得再匀，当水流入秧田时，总免不了要冲散一些谷粒，破坏他的“落谷稀”播种法。今年在全体组员的共同劳动和共同研究下，就想出了合理的浇水办法，使“落谷稀”的播种法更加完善了。对于怕多收粮就要多负担的顾虑，工作组同志就拿陈永康本人的事实来教育他和大家。他去年获得高额产量后，政府不但没有向他多征收公粮，而且奖励了他。经过用这些事实进行教育，陈永康的思想顾虑就开始解除了，增产信心也逐渐提高了。
    体验到了互助组的好处
    现在，陈永康互助组已胜利地完成了春修、播种、积肥，并已开始进行了春耕工作。经过这一个时期互助生产集体劳动的初步体验，他们在总结这一阶段的生产工作时（按：他们一年的农事活动分为五个阶段：第一阶段是春修积肥，秧田播种；第二阶段是春耕插秧，夏收夏种；第三阶段是中耕耘耥，按期施追肥，合理灌溉，防治病虫害；第四阶段是秋收（主要收稻谷），秋种（种小麦、油菜及豆类）；第五阶段是副业生产，修置农具），已开始体会到了组织起来的好处。他们都高兴地说：
    “组织起来就是比单干强！”陈永康也说：“去年我一个人干，大工（技术性强的）小工（如挑草、刨茬、种瓜等）都得我一个人做，顾了东顾不了西，因此就不能把全部精力集中到研究改进农作技术上。今年组织起来以后，这些小工全由妇女们做了。去年我个人做六分秧田，刨茬、翻土、挖沟、落谷、灌水、施肥全得一个人搞，结果费了一个星期功夫才做好。今年全组共做了四亩合式秧田，由于组织起来能分工合作，女刨茬，男翻田，有人管灌水，我专管播种（因为播种最需要好的技术），今年做的秧田不但省了工，而且比那一年做得都好。现在我开始体会到了组织起来比单干强的道理。”
    还须继续加强政治思想教育
    陈永康互助组目前还有两个问题需要当地领导机关注意帮助解决：
    第一、必须继续进行关于组织起来集体生产的思想教育。陈永康本人是中农，他原来对组织起来的要求很淡漠。当工作组的同志向他提出要组织互助组时，他很长时间只是说：“慢慢来，慢慢来。”实际上，当时他认为组织起来提高产量，还不如他个人干有保障。现在他虽然在集体劳动的过程中，开始体验到组织起来的好处，但这还是很不够的。当地领导机关过去对思想教育问题没有足够的重视，只是注意了加强对陈永康互助组的技术指导，这是很大的缺点。目前松江县领导机关决定对陈永康互助组加强政治领导，这是十分必要的。
    第二、工作组干部要大胆放手，克服包办代替的作风。陈永康互助组已成立了四个多月，但到现在，每天召集开会评工记账都还是苏南行政公署农林处派去的干部代作。我曾参加他们的两次评工会，都是干部提问题，陈永康和其他组员回答，很少展开讨论。工分为什么应该那样评？又为什么要那样记？组员们都还不十分了解。这样就形成了他们对干部的依赖。必须设法克服这种包办代替的作法，启发全体组员们的积极性和创造性，才能进一步巩固互助组，进一步加强每个组员的爱国增产信心。
