Employees of the State-Owned Mengjiagang Mechanical Farm
Guarantee to Increase Yield Per Mu by 20% Compared to Local Farmers

Respected Chairman Mao: Under your wise leadership, we have shouldered the great and glorious task of providing a demonstration of collectivization to farmers through the superiority of state-owned farm production. At the spring plowing mobilization meeting, we unanimously and firmly stated: we must improve cultivation techniques, propagate superior varieties, strengthen business management, implement economic accounting, and conscientiously carry out drought prevention and resistance work to overcome all difficulties, increase yield per unit area, and achieve a bumper harvest. We are confident in completing the glorious task of producing 7,000 tons of grain and increasing production by 1,400 tons this year, guaranteeing that the yield per mu will exceed the yield per mu of local farmers by 20%. We will use the practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy to strike back at the heinous crimes of the US imperialists in launching bacteriological warfare. We respectfully wish you good health.

The entire staff of the State-Owned Mengjiagang Mechanical Farm

    敬爱的毛主席：在您英明的领导下，我们肩负起了伟大的光荣的任务，以国营农场生产的优越性，向农民进行集体化的示范教育。在春耕动员大会上，我们一致坚决表示：要提高耕作技术，繁殖优良品种，加强经营管理，实行经济核算，认真作好防旱、抗旱工作，以战胜一切困难，提高单位面积产量，达到丰收。我们有信心完成今年生产七千吨粮食和增产一千四百吨粮食的光荣任务，每亩地产量保证超过当地农民每亩地产量的百分之二十。我们要用增产节约的实际行动，回击美帝国主义发动细菌战的滔天罪行。敬祝您身体健康    国营孟家岗机械农场全体员工
