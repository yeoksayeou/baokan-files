    Successfully Creates Wind-Powered Fan and Sprayer, Greatly Aiding Coal Mine Safety Work
    Editor Comrade: Li Zhilin, a safety technician at the Fuguo Mine in the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine, has successively created successful "wind-powered fans" and "sprayers." Ventilation is essential inside coal mine pits for workers to produce efficiently. Otherwise, workers in the pit will not get enough air, or methane will not be exhausted due to lack of wind, which can easily lead to explosions. In the past, all pits in the Xi'an mining area used "electric fans." The biggest weakness of "electric fans" is that they cannot be used in places with high methane levels in the pit. Because it uses electricity as its power source, the moving parts inside are very likely to generate heat and sparks when rotating, which can cause methane explosions. Last August, with the encouragement and help of his comrades, Li Zhilin created the "wind-powered fan." Its characteristics are: first, because it uses wind as its power source, it will not cause explosions when used in places with high methane levels; second, it is lightweight, only twenty kilograms, and can be moved around easily, unlike the bulkiness of "electric fans"; third, it can be installed in the most remote workplaces, such as small gullies and small air ducts; while "electric fans" cannot do this. Comrade Li Zhilin also created a "sprayer." This is a small machine used in pits to spread rock dust or lime water to prevent coal dust explosions. In the past, each pit had full-time workers who used their hands or shovels to spread rock dust. This not only affected the health of the workers, but also the rock dust was spread unevenly, and its effect was not significant. The "sprayer" created by Li Zhilin has a simple structure, consisting of two horizontal and vertical two-inch iron pipes and spray nozzles. As long as the air hose is inserted into the sprayer, rock dust or lime water can be sprayed out. This overcomes the shortcomings of manual dusting in the past. The factory has been using the above two safety tools for half a year, and these two tools have played a great role in coal mine safety work.

    创制风力风机和喷雾器成功  对煤矿保安工作有很大帮助
    编辑同志：东北西安煤矿富国矿保安技术人员李志林，先后创造“风力风机”和“喷雾器”成功。煤矿坑内必须通风，工人才好在里面生产。否则，坑内作业人员得不到足够的空气，或因无风排不出去瓦斯，就容易发生爆炸事故。过去，西安矿区各坑都使用“电力风机”。“电力风机”最大的弱点，就是不能在坑内瓦斯大的地方使用。因为它以电为原动力，里面的毛头转动时极易磨擦生热发生火花，引起瓦斯爆炸。去年八月，李志林在同志们的鼓励和帮助下，创造出了“风力风机”。它的特点：一，因为用风作原动力，在瓦斯大的地方使用，也不会引起爆炸，第二，重量轻，只有二十公斤，可随便挪动，不像“电力风机”的笨重；第三，能安设在最偏僻的工作场所，如小川、小风道等处；而“电力风机”却不能这样。李志林同志还创造了“喷雾器”。这是在坑内用作散布岩粉或石灰水，以防止煤尘爆发的小机器。过去，各坑都有专职的工人，用手或用铁锹散布岩粉。这不但影响工人的健康，而且散布的岩粉不均匀，作用不大。李志林创造的“喷雾器”构造简单，由横竖两个二寸铁管和喷射口等零件制成，只要把风绳插在喷雾器上，就能把岩粉或石灰水喷射出去。这就克服了以前用人工撒粉的缺点。该厂使用以上两种安全工具已有半年，这两种工具在煤矿保安工作上起了很大作用。
