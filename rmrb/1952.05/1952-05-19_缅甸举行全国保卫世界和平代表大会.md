    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, May 17th: The All-Burma Congress for the Defense of World Peace was held from May 10th to 12th in Rangoon, the capital of Burma. The congress was attended by over 400 representatives of peace-loving people from all regions, ethnic minorities, and social strata of Burma. Over 480 people attended the opening ceremony as observers, along with over a hundred special guests and foreign guests.

    After the opening of the congress on the morning of the 10th, Secretary Maung Maung Gyee first reported that Hu Yuzhi, the representative of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, was unable to attend the congress because the British authorities in Hong Kong refused to issue him a visa. All the representatives expressed their indignation at this and unanimously protested against the illegal measures taken by the British imperialists to undermine the peace movement of the Chinese and Burmese peoples. Subsequently, Chairman Thakin Lwin delivered a report on how to strive for peace. After briefly listing the ways in which American imperialism has controlled the United Nations, invaded Korea, occupied Taiwan, and suppressed colonial liberation movements, he emphasized that because the American imperialists have openly armed Japan and engaged in bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, they have openly made themselves enemies of the people of the world. He finally called on the people of Burma to unite in order to defend world peace if they want to defend their own peace.

    During the congress, many representatives spoke enthusiastically on issues such as how to launch a nationwide peace movement in Burma and how to defend world peace, fully demonstrating the Burmese people's firm will to defend peace.

    The congress elected 72 central committee members of the Burma Committee for the Defense of World Peace, elected Thakin Kodaw Hmaing as chairman, and passed the following important resolutions: 1. Oppose the establishment of military bases by imperialism in Asia, and reject all "aid" from imperialism; 2. Oppose the American-made "peace treaty" with Japan, and oppose arming Japan; 3. Oppose American imperialism's aggression against Korea and its undermining of the Korean armistice negotiations; the Korean question should be resolved by the Korean people themselves; 4. Sympathize with and support the national liberation movements of the peoples of Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and other countries, and oppose imperialist armed intervention; 5. Oppose arming West Germany, and demand that the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France conclude a peace treaty with Germany; 6. Prohibit the use of atomic weapons, and demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact; 7. Oppose American imperialism's bacteriological warfare, and demand that the United Nations punish the American authorities who are conducting bacteriological warfare; 8. Oppose imperialist economic blockades, and demand that all countries conduct trade on an equal and mutually beneficial basis; 9. Oppose American imperialism's "Mutual Security Act."

    The day after the congress closed, more than 3,000 people, including workers, students, women, monks, and representatives from various counties and ethnic groups, as well as farmers from the suburbs of Rangoon, held a demonstration to celebrate the victory of the congress.
