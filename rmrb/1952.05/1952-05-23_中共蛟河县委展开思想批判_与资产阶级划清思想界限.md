    CCP Jiaohe County Committee Launches Ideological Criticism
    To Draw a Clear Ideological Line with the Bourgeoisie
    To the Editor: After purging the class alien element Yin Zihua, the CCP Jiaohe County Committee convened all the active members of the party in Jiaohe to criticize the degeneration of certain members of the former County Committee. Through this ideological criticism, the working cadres in the offices have basically overcome their hedonistic thinking and are determined to draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology. Party members in the countryside have criticized the erroneous thinking of being unwilling to lead mutual aid teams. Some party members who had previously hired long-term laborers and practiced usury have also settled accounts with their exploitationist thinking.
    The County Committee has decided to launch planned, organized, and systematic ideological criticism in all party grassroots organizations upon the conclusion of the spring plowing season, so that all party members in Jiaohe County can draw a clear ideological and practical line with the bourgeoisie.

    中共蛟河县委展开思想批判
    与资产阶级划清思想界限
    编辑同志：中共蛟河县委会自从清洗了阶级异己分子殷子华以后，曾召集蛟河全党的活动分子，批判前县委会中某些成员蜕化变质的事件。经过这次思想批判，机关工作干部基本上克服了享乐思想，决心要和资产阶级思想划清界限；农村中的党员批判了不愿领导互助组的错误思想。某些曾经雇长工和放高利贷的党员并清算了自己的剥削思想。
    县委决定在结束春耕时，在全党的基层组织中，开展有计划、有组织、有系统的思想批判工作，使蛟河县全体党员从思想上和行动上跟资产阶级划清思想界限。
