    Burning Mountains to Reclaim Land in Mountainous Areas Should Be Strictly Prohibited

    Editor: Farmers in mountainous areas have a tradition of burning mountains to reclaim land in the spring, which easily causes mountain fires. For example, in Daqing Township, Twelfth District of Song County, Henan Province, more than 30 mu of mountain forest were destroyed due to burning mountains to reclaim land within five days in early April. In Zhongtougou, Sixth District, a mountain fire was caused by burning mountains to reclaim land, which spread to Nangou, Foquan Temple Township, Fifth District, and burned for two days before it was extinguished. Therefore, I suggest that cadres in mountainous areas should thoroughly publicize the policy of protecting forests and preventing fire, and strictly prohibit burning mountains to reclaim land.

    山区应严禁烧山开荒
    编辑同志：山地农民在春季素有烧山开荒的习惯，这极易引起山火。如河南嵩县十二区大青乡在四月初的五天内，就因烧山开荒，烧毁山林三十多亩。六区中头沟因烧山开荒，引起山火，蔓延到五区佛泉寺乡南沟，烧了两天才熄。因此我建议山区各地干部，要深入宣传护林防火政策，严禁烧山开荒。　赵克让
