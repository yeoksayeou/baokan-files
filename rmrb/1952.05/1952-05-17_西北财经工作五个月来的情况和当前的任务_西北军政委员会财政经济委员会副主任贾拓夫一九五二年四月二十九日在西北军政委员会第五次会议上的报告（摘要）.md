Since the fourth meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, in the past five months, we have first followed the decision of the meeting, discussed and arranged the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, and submitted it to the Military and Political Committee for approval, and announced the struggle target of 15,000 billion yuan for the Northwest region's financial and economic system in 1952 to increase production and practice economy; then we fully launched the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, creating more favorable conditions for the victorious realization of the task of increasing production and practicing economy and ensuring national defense construction, stabilizing prices, and focusing on various undertakings.

In January and February, the "Three-Anti" movement absorbed a large portion of the cadres, which had a certain impact on the social and economic work. The government took emergency measures for this purpose, instructing the financial and economic departments in late February to assign one-third to one-half of the cadres to take into account business. Since March, the phenomenon of separation between urban and rural areas and stagnation of production has been rapidly reversed and is being reversed, and the spring plowing and drought prevention work has been successfully completed. On the financial front, on the basis of continuing to rectify and increase income, favorable conditions have been laid for managing expenditure work. State-owned enterprises quickly entrusted private industries with processing and ordering. The allocation of materials by state-owned enterprises has basically completed the first quarter's plan, transferring in large quantities of cement, wood, steel, pig iron, cloth, and chemical fertilizers to supply the needs of basic construction and agricultural spring plowing; at the same time, a large amount of cotton and various livestock products were transferred out to supply the production needs of other regions, enabling the railway transportation plan of the financial and economic system in the first quarter to be overfulfilled, increasing by 123% compared with the same period last year. Tax revenue has also improved month by month, completing the first quarter's collection plan. Thanks to the efforts of state-owned trade departments to supply the market and expand commissioned processing and procurement, prices across the region have stabilized. Calculated on the basis of the average wholesale price of 47 major commodities in Xi'an, prices at the end of March fell by 2.3% compared with December last year. At the same time, as a result of the "Five-Anti" movement, processing and ordering costs have been reduced. Therefore, the listed prices of more than 1,500 kinds of daily-use industrial products have been reduced by 2% to 22%, and the listed price of flour has been reduced by 3.5%. This has directly increased the welfare of consumers and created more favorable conditions for industrialists and businessmen to further expand the market. These are all direct benefits brought to the people by the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements.

The key to enlivening the national economy at present lies in carrying forward last year's experience, mobilizing public and private commerce and cooperatives, vigorously organizing material exchanges, strictly implementing the signed exchange contracts, and accelerating the turnover of social production funds.

Spring plowing and drought prevention are the central tasks that overwhelm everything in the spring. In late February, people's governments at and above the county level formed "Production and Drought Prevention Committees" with the main responsible cadres, and mobilized a large number of cadres to go to the countryside. According to statistics from five provinces, one municipality, one special district, and sixty counties, more than 5,000 cadres from the working groups that went deep into the rural areas this spring to inspect and promote production and drought prevention work. The broad masses enthusiastically joined the unprecedented patriotic production increase and drought prevention spring plowing campaign, and many new atmospheres appeared. This year, the spring wheat area started plowing and sowing generally one week earlier than last year; the spring wheat area is more than 13 million mu, of which nearly 2 million mu were treated with medicinal seed dressing, an increase of more than five times compared with last year. Winter wheat was hoeed once more than last year, and wheat seedlings are growing vigorously. In Shaanxi, cotton fields are generally cultivated three times, harrowed four times, and rolled five times, and cotton seeds are generally selected and sown in time for moisture. The amount of fertilizer applied to various crops has increased by an average of 20% compared with last year. In many places, such as Xinjiang Province, the habit of not applying fertilizer has been broken, and old manure piles and kang soil that have been accumulated for many years have been dug up. This spring, the masses have made great achievements in building small-scale water conservancy projects. According to very incomplete statistics, 7,625 small-scale canals have been built and repaired in two months, expanding the irrigated area by more than 556,900 mu, which has completed 51% of the region's annual plan. 27,121 wells have been dug, completing 54% of the annual plan. The spring repair project of large-scale canals is nearing completion, and new construction projects are generally starting. Many irrigation areas have paid attention to improving irrigation management, democratically formulating water use systems, and promoting economic water use methods such as shallow irrigation, furrow irrigation, frequent irrigation, and day and night rotation, expanding the irrigated area by a considerable amount.

On the basis of the victorious completion of land reform, and under the call of the drought prevention, anti-drought, production increase, and economy practice movement, agricultural mutual aid organizations have also developed by leaps and bounds. The male and female labor force participating in mutual aid groups generally averages around 50%, an increase of about double compared with last year. Among them, year-round mutual aid groups account for about 20%, and the rest are mostly temporary seasonal organizations, and many are only in form. However, in production and drought prevention, especially in canal repair, well digging, and weeding, most mutual aid groups have played a certain positive role.

In order to prevent drought and spring plowing, the National People's Bank plans to loan more than 310 billion yuan in agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and water conservancy this year, and two-thirds have been allocated. At the same time, free lending in rural areas is also more active than before. As of April 20, the state-owned trade system had purchased grain, cotton, livestock products, and local and special products totaling more than 320 billion yuan, and the total purchase value of cooperatives in the first quarter reached 159.7 billion yuan (of which the part purchased on behalf of trade is repeated), which enlivened the rural economy.

In order to cooperate with the spring plowing and drought prevention movement and do a good job in soil and water conservation, a wave of tree planting and afforestation has been set off in various places.

Due to the vigorous mobilization and organization of winter grass and forage reserves last winter and the improvement of feeding management, livestock mortality has been greatly reduced compared with last spring. However, there will still be a period of scarcity of fodder in the future, and all localities should take precautions in advance. This year, various localities have also launched a wolf hunting campaign to reduce damage to livestock. Although various localities have tried to do the selection and breeding of breeding livestock, they have not yet generally formed a mass movement. In the future, we must strengthen the organizational leadership in this area.

With the increase of the masses' production enthusiasm and the development of agricultural, animal husbandry, and water conservancy work, the main weaknesses and problems in our work are exposed: First, the leadership's deployment cannot keep up with the demands of the masses, and general appeals are more than specific guidance, and cadres lack production experience. Second, there is a serious formalism and coercion in mutual aid organizations, forcing the formation of groups, indiscriminately matching, and simply emphasizing selflessness, without studying work points and accounting, thus deviating from the guiding principle of voluntary mutual benefit, which is difficult to consolidate. Third, the patriotic production increase competition movement has not been fully launched, and some places still neglect or even abandon this most effective leadership method for promoting the production movement. Fourth, due to lack of foresight, or due to limitations of manpower, financial resources, and materials, preparations are not enough, such as lack of seedlings for afforestation, lack of breeding livestock for reproduction, and lack of agricultural tools, waterwheels, pesticide equipment, and fertilizers for intensive cultivation. These shortcomings must be continuously overcome in the future.

State-owned factories, mines, and transportation departments, due to the improvement of the class consciousness and labor enthusiasm of workers and staff in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, although the leadership cadres mostly turned to the "Three-Anti", which greatly weakened the leadership of production, and there were many places where the upper and lower levels were out of touch, the production situation generally rose day by day, the production and work efficiency continued to improve, and the reduction of costs and savings of funds also made significant achievements. The Oil Mine put forward the slogan of "Not completing the production task is not a complete victory in the fight against tigers" in the "Three-Anti" movement. In the first quarter, all employees put forward 449 rationalization proposals, of which 14% have been implemented. According to the comprehensive statistics of various products as of March, not only made up for the losses of certain aspects and periods in the "Three-Anti" movement that did not meet the quotas, but also completed 103.44% of the self-set production increase and economy practice plan (which is higher than the indicators given by the higher authorities). The Northwest Machine Factory employees put forward 58 rationalization proposals, of which 50 were approved and adopted, greatly improving production efficiency. Therefore, the total value of the factory's annual production increase and economy practice plan has now been increased to 21 billion yuan.

There have also been significant achievements in reducing consumption quotas and reducing costs. For example, the average power consumption per piece of yarn in the first and second textile factories of the Northwest Textile Construction Company in the first quarter has dropped from 206.84 kWh last year to 203.12 kWh, and the average has dropped to 193.474 kWh from April 1 to 18. The average labor cost per piece of yarn in the first quarter dropped from 16.83 in the fourth quarter of last year to 14.55, a decrease of 13.5%.

In terms of clearing assets and verifying funds, most of the state-owned factories and mines under the Northwest Industry Department can be completed by the end of April. Although the surplus funds that can be turned over have not yet reached the expected target, it can already explain the improvement of the operation and management of the factories and the efforts of the employees to reduce consumption quotas.

The total amount of basic construction investment approved by the Northwest Financial and Economic System this year
(including central investment) accounts for more than 50% of the total expenditure of the Northwest in 1952. If there is negligence, the loss will greatly exceed the waste of existing state-owned production units. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have created favorable conditions for plugging this loophole. We must consolidate and carry forward the valuable efforts of the employees who are now enthusiastically and automatically improving their work in a planned and organized way from the leadership. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have also improved the production efficiency and work efficiency of basic construction. For example, the Northwest Construction Company used to take three months to complete the design, but now it can be completed in only half a month; after Lanzhou implemented the new road maintenance method, the work efficiency has generally improved. In the past, each person could pave 13 cubic meters of sand per day, and now some have reached 32 cubic meters; the Northwest State Cotton No. 1 Factory implemented the assembly line operation method in the installation project, forming various specialized installation groups according to the work procedures, clarifying the division of labor, implementing the responsibility system, and promoting the rationalization proposal movement. From December 1 last year to March 25 this year, the installation has been basically completed, reducing 16,100 workdays compared with the original plan. There has also been a new beginning in reducing quotas and saving materials. For example, after the "Three-Anti" movement, according to the standards of their own reduction quotas, 14 smaller basic construction units, after review, further reduced wood by 24%, cement by 8.64%, and steel by 8.57%, without affecting the engineering specifications. There are also good examples in saving investment. For example, after reviewing the factory design of the Northwest State Cotton No. 2 Factory, it can save 24.3% of the investment; after repeated review of the design of the Shaanxi Agricultural Tool Factory, it can still save 35% of the funds under the conditions of increasing the factory construction task by nearly one time; the investment of the Yinchuan Power Plant was reduced by 23.4%. These good beginnings and spirit in basic construction must continue to be carried forward after the achievements of the Northwest Railway Main Line Engineering Bureau.

There are still many problems in industrial, mining, transportation, and all basic construction departments. The main problems are: First, there is still a lack of specific ideological leadership and organizational guidance on the general line of relying on the working class to develop production. There are more general mobilizations and appeals to complete tasks; there is less education to inspire workers' awareness of the leading class and the prospects of socialism in combination with the completion of tasks. There are more worker suggestions and reflections; there is less organizational guidance for brainstorming ideas, finding tricks, and calculating accounts carefully. Leading cadres often either shout slogans emptily, are out of touch with the masses, or are clueless and sway from side to side, falling behind the masses. Second, in terms of operation and management, it lags behind the production enthusiasm of the workers and the masses. New creations and new records continue to appear in the first quarter, the production efficiency of workshops and units has greatly improved, and consumption quotas have been greatly reduced, but many of the production increase and economy practice tasks of the entire factory and mine have not been completed. Third, there is no strict implementation of the grass-roots records and timely systematic statistical system, and it is impossible to understand the overall situation and guide the work in a timely manner, so that the degree of completion of the production tasks and the progress of basic construction cannot be grasped at any time. Fourth, the economic accounting system has not been fully implemented, costs cannot be calculated accurately at any time, and there are still rough estimates and reckless calculations. So far, the exact figures for production increase and economy practice in the first quarter cannot be calculated. Fifth, basic construction units have no dedicated personnel in charge, lack cadres, cannot be solely responsible for handling affairs, which affects the progress and quality. In addition to the responsible departments should be responsible for improvement, we must ask the party organizations and governments in various places to pay attention to dispatching strong cadres to the industrial, mining, and transportation departments; especially for large-scale basic construction, we must designate a dedicated person to be responsible for it before the design is carried out, and the full-time cadres of each part must be equipped before construction, so as to ensure the completion of the basic construction tasks. Not only must we overcome the waste in construction, but also require that we can quickly lead production after completion.

The "Three-Anti" movement postponed the time for compiling the 1952 national economic plan by more than two months; however, the "Three-Anti" movement brought countless strength and conditions for the smooth progress and guaranteed implementation of the planning work. For example, measured by the various indicators passed by the Fourth Meeting of the Northwest Military and Political Committee in November last year and the 15,000 billion yuan production increase and economy practice indicators approved and announced by the Northwest Military and Political Committee, except for individual undertakings that cannot be completed due to the original plan being inconsistent with the actual situation or changes in objective conditions, under the conditions of improving the political awareness level and actively enthusiastic work of the vast number of employees and working people, many departments have proposed higher indicators for this year's planning work, or have already overfulfilled the original plan in the practice of the first quarter. This brings a high degree of confidence in "developing production, prospering the economy" and completing the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 15,000 billion yuan. For example, the original plan for grain production increase was 1 billion jin, but it has now increased to 1.3 billion jin; the original plan for cotton production increase was 600,000 dan, but it has now been increased to 710,000 dan; the original plan for sheep breeding was 10%, but it has now been increased to 13%; the state-owned trade system originally planned to increase the total purchase value this year by 50% compared with last year, but it has now been revised to increase by 93% according to social needs and possibilities, and the total sales value has increased from the original plan of 100% to 143.73%.

The great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has opened up a broad road for the realization of production increase and economy practice tasks by public and private economies this year, and created the necessary conditions for the country to carry out long-term construction in the future. The current main tasks are to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, complete the production plans of industrial, mining, and transportation, and basic construction tasks, rapidly and comprehensively restore and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and at home and abroad, and strive to achieve and exceed the task of increasing production and practicing economy by 15,000 billion yuan in the financial and economic system of the entire region.

    西北财经工作五个月来的情况和当前的任务
    ——西北军政委员会财政经济委员会副主任贾拓夫一九五二年四月二十九日在西北军政委员会第五次会议上的报告（摘要）
    自西北军政委员会第四次会议迄今五个月期间，我们首先是遵照会议决定，讨论和布置了增产节约的计划工作，并提请军政委员会批准，公布了一九五二年度西北全区财经系统增产节约一万五千亿元的奋斗指标；随即全力展开“三反”运动和“五反”运动，为增产节约任务的胜利实现和保证国防建设、稳定物价、有重点地举办各种事业，创造了更有利的条件。
    一、二月间，由于干部力量大部集中于“三反”，社会经济的业务工作受到一定程度的影响，政府为此作了紧急措施，即在二月下旬指示各财经部门抽出三分之一以至二分之一干部兼顾业务。从三月起，就迅速扭转了和正在扭转着城乡脱节、生产停滞现象，并胜利地完成了春耕防旱工作。财政方面也在继续整顿与增加收入的基础上，对于管好支出工作奠定了有利条件。国营经济迅速对私营工业进行了委托加工、定货。国营经济的物资调拨，基本上也完成了第一季度计划，调入大量水泥、木材、钢材、生铁、布匹和化学肥料，以供应基本建设和农业春耕的需要；同时，又调出大量棉花和各种畜产品，以供应外区生产需要，使第一季度财经系统铁路运输计划超额完成，并较去年同期增加百分之一百二十三。税收方面，也逐月好转，完成了第一季度征收计划。由于国营贸易部门努力供应市场并扩大委托加工和采购，全区物价稳定。如以西安市四十七种主要商品批发价平均计算，三月底较去年十二月份落价百分之二点三。同时，由于“五反”运动的结果，加工定货成本都减低了。因此，一千五百多种日用工业品的牌价降低了百分之二至二十二，面粉牌价降低了百分之三点五。这就直接增进了消费者的生活福利，并为工商业者进一步扩大市场造成更有利的条件。这都是“三反”“五反”直接给予人民的实惠。
    目前活跃国民经济的关键，在于发扬去年的经验，发动公私商业及合作社，大力组织物资交流，严格执行已签订的交流合同，加速社会生产资金的周转。
    ×　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    春耕防旱是春季压倒一切的中心工作。二月下旬，县以上各级人民政府都抽出主要负责干部组成“生产防旱委员会”，并动员大批干部下乡。据五省一市一专署和六十个县的统计，今春深入农村、检查推动生产防旱工作的工作组干部就有五千多人。广大群众热烈地加入了空前规模的爱国增产防旱春耕运动，出现了许多新气象。今年春麦区开犁播种，一般都较去年提早一周；春麦面积一千三百余万亩，其中实行药剂拌种的近二百万亩，较去年增加五倍以上。冬麦大部比去年多锄一次，麦苗生长旺盛。陕西棉田一般做到耕三、耙四、耱五，并普遍进行棉籽粒选，抢墒播种。各种作物施肥数量平均较去年增加二成，许多地方，如新疆省已打破了向不施肥的习惯，把多年的老粪堆、炕土也挖掘一空。今春群众兴修小型水利的成绩很大，据极不完全的统计，两个月内已兴修和整修小型渠道七千六百二十五条，扩大灌溉面积五十五万六千九百多亩，已完成全区全年计划百分之五十一。打井二万七千一百二十一眼，已完成全年计划百分之五十四。大型渠道春修工程已接近完成，新修工程正在普遍开始。许多灌区都注意了改善灌溉管理，民主订立用水制度，推广浅灌、沟灌、勤灌、日夜轮浇等经济用水的方法，扩充灌溉面积不少。
    在胜利完成土地改革的基础上，并在防旱抗旱增产节约运动的号召下，农业互助组织也有突飞猛进的发展。参加互助组的男女劳力，一般平均在百分之五十左右，较去年约增加一倍。其中常年互助组约占百分之二十上下，其余大部是临时季节性的组织，且有不少徒具形式。但在生产防旱、特别是修渠、打井、锄草等工作中，大半互助组都发挥了一定的积极作用。
    为了防旱春耕，国家人民银行今年在农牧林业和水利方面计划贷款三千一百余亿元，已拨出三分之二。同时，农村自由借贷也较前活跃。国营贸易系统截至四月二十日止，已收购粮、棉、畜产及土产特产等总值达三千二百多亿元，合作社第一季度收购总值达一千五百九十七亿元（其中代贸易收购部分重复），活跃了农村经济。
    为了配合春耕防旱运动，做好水土保持工作，各地普遍掀起植树造林热潮。
    由于去冬大力动员组织储备冬天草料，改善饲养管理，牲畜死亡现象已较去春大为减少。惟今后仍有一个青黄不接时期，各地都应预为防范。今年各地还发动了打狼运动，减少了牲畜的损害。对于选育种畜工作，各地虽有试办，但尚未普遍形成群众性的运动，今后必须加强这一方面的组织领导。
    随着群众生产积极性的增长和农牧水利工作的发展，暴露出我们工作中的主要弱点和问题是：一、领导部署赶不上群众的要求，一般号召多于具体指导，干部缺乏生产经验。二、互助组织中严重地存在着形式主义和强迫命令现象，强迫编组，胡搭乱配，单纯强调大公无私，不研究计工算账，因而离开了自愿两利的指导方针，难以巩固。三、爱国增产竞赛运动尚未全面展开，有些地方仍然忽视，甚至放弃了这个推动生产运动最有效的领导方法。四、由于缺乏预见，或由于人力、财力、物力的限制，准备工作不够，如造林缺少树苗，繁殖缺乏种畜，精耕细作缺乏农具、水车、药械、肥料等。这些缺点，都必须在今后继续加以克服。
    ×　　　　×　　　　×
    国营厂矿和交通部门，由于在“三反”“五反”中提高了职工的阶级觉悟和劳动热情，虽因领导干部大半转入“三反”，相当减弱了对生产的领导，上下脱节之处甚多，但生产情况一般仍是逐日上升，生产和工作效率不断提高，降低成本、节约资金也都有显著成绩。油矿在“三反”中提出“不完成生产任务，不算打虎全胜”的口号，全体职工在第一季度内提出合理化建议达四百四十九件，已实行的占百分之十四。截至三月份各种产品综合统计，不仅补足了“三反”中某一方面某一时期未达定额的损失，并已完成自订增产节约计划（较上级给的指标为高）的百分之一百零三点四四。西北机器厂职工提出合理化建议五十八件，被批准采纳的就有五十件，提高生产效率很大。因此该厂全年增产节约计划的总值现已提高到二百一十亿元。
    在降低消耗定额、减少成本方面也有显著成效。如西北纺织建设公司第一、第二两纺织厂每件纱第一季度平均用电已由去年的二○六点八四度降至二○三点一二度，四月一日至十八日平均又降至一九三点四七四度。第一季度平均每件纱扯工由去年第四季度的一六点八三降至一四点五五，即降低了百分之十三点五。
    在清理资产、核定资金方面，西北工业部所属国营厂矿，极大部分可在四月底完成，可缴回的多余资金虽然尚未达到预期的指标，但已可说明各厂经营管理方面的改善和职工减低消耗定额的努力。
    西北财经系统今年已批准的基本建设投资总额
    （包括中央投资）占西北一九五二年全部支出的百分之五十以上，如有疏忽，其损失将会大大超过现有国营各生产单位的浪费。“三反”“五反”为堵塞这种漏洞造成了有利条件，我们必须把职工中现已热情地自动改进工作的可贵努力，从领导方面加以有计划有组织地巩固和发扬。“三反”和“五反”运动使基本建设的生产效率和工作效率也提高了。如西北建筑公司过去要三个月才能完成的设计，现在只要半月就可完成；兰州推行新养路法后，工效普遍提高，过去铺沙每人每天十三公方，现在有的已达三十二公方；西北国棉一厂安装工程中推行了流水作业法，按照工序分别组成各种专业性的安装小组，明确分工，实行专责制，并推行合理化建议运动，从去年十二月一日至今年三月二十五日已基本全部完成安装，较原计划减少一万六千一百个工。在减低定额、节约器材方面也有了新的开端，如十四个较小的基本建设单位，在“三反”后根据其自行减缩定额的标准，经过审核，木材又核减了百分之二十四，水泥又核减了百分之八点六四，钢材又核减了百分之八点五七，并不影响工程规格。在节约投资上也有了良好的范例，如西北国棉二厂建厂设计经过审核后，可以节约投资百分之二十四点三；陕西农具厂设计经反复申核，在提高建厂任务量几及一倍的条件下，仍可节约资金百分之三十五；银川电厂投资核减百分之二十三点四。在基本建设中这些良好的开端和精神，必须继西北铁路干线工程局已有成绩之后，继续加以发扬。
    工矿交通方面和所有基本建设部门存在的问题还很多，主要是：一、在依靠工人阶级发展生产的总路线上，还缺乏具体的思想领导和组织指导。一般鼓动号召完成任务时多；结合任务的完成，启发工人对领导阶级的自觉和社会主义前途的认识的教育少。工人建议反映多；出主意找窍门算细帐的组织指导少。领导干部往往不是空喊口号、脱离群众，便是心中无数、左右摇摆，落在了群众后边。二、在经营管理上，落后于工人群众的生产热情。第一季度新创造、新纪录不断出现，车间单位生产效率大量提高，消耗定额大量减低，但全厂矿增产节约任务还有许多没有完成。三、没有严格执行基层纪录和及时有系统的统计制度，不能及时了解全面、指导工作，以致对生产任务的完成程度和基本建设进度不能随时掌握。四、经济核算制度没有全面贯彻，成本不能随时精确计算，仍有粗估冒打现象，至今仍不能计算出第一季度增产节约的精确数字。五、基本建设单位没有专人负责，缺少干部，不能专责专办，影响进度和质量。以上所述，除主管部门应负责改进者外，必须提请各地党的组织和政府注意抽派坚强干部，到工矿交通部门中去；特别是对于大型基本建设，今后必须在进行设计前就指定脱离其他工作的专人负责，施工前就把各部分专职干部配备起来，才能保证基本建设任务的完成。不仅要克服施工中的浪费，并要求完工后即能迅速领导生产。
    “三反”把编制一九五二年国民经济计划工作的时间推迟了两个月以上；但是，“三反”给计划工作的顺利进展并保证实现，带来了不可数计的力量和条件。如以去年十一月西北军政委员会第四次会议所通过的各项指标和西北军政委员会批准公布的一万五千亿元的增产节约指标为标准来衡量，除了因原计划不符实际或客观条件变动而不能完成的个别部分事业外，在广大职工和劳动人民政治觉悟水平提高和积极热情工作的情况下，许多部门对今年的计划工作量，提出了更高的指标，或者已经在第
    一季度的实践中超额完成了原有计划。这就为“发展生产，繁荣经济”和完成一万五千亿元增产节约任务带来了高度的信心。如粮食增产原计划为十亿斤，现已增至十三亿斤；棉花增产原计六十万担，现已提高至七十一万担；羊增殖原计划为百分之十，现已提高至百分之十三；国营贸易系统原计今年收购总值较去年增加百分之五十，现已按社会需要和可能改订为增加百分之九十三，销货总值从原计增加百分之百提高为百分之一百四十三点七三。
    “三反”“五反”运动的伟大胜利，已经为今年公私经济实现增产节约任务开辟了广阔的道路，并为今后国家进行长期建设创造了必需的条件。当前主要任务就是要努力争取今年农业的大丰收，完成工矿交通生产计划和基本建设的任务，迅速全面地恢复和促进城乡内外物资交流，为在全区财经系统实现并超过增产节约一万五千亿元的任务而奋斗。
