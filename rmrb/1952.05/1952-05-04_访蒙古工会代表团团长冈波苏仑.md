    Interview with Gonbosuren, Head of the Mongolian Trade Union Delegation
    The Mongolian Trade Union Delegation, invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, brought us the brotherly friendship of the Mongolian people towards New China, and also brought us the latest news from our friendly neighbor.
    Gonbosuren, head of the Mongolian Trade Union Delegation, told reporters: "More than thirty years ago, Mongolia was the most backward country in Asia. At that time, there was not even a school or a factory in the whole country." He said that after thirty years of intense labor, Mongolia has now taken on a completely new look: the number of livestock has increased by two and a half times compared to before the revolution; total industrial output has increased by 380 times in the last twenty years; due to the large-scale use of new agricultural machinery and the expansion of cultivated land area, agricultural production has increased by 604.7 percent in the last ten years; modern means of transportation have emerged. At the airport in Ulaanbaatar, airplanes take off and land all day long, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles speed along the highways, and the whistles of trains frequently roar in the north and east of the republic...
    He said that the revolution brought culture to the working people. In Mongolia, many people did not understand what education was in the past, but now almost everyone is literate. Hundreds of middle schools, primary schools, technical schools, and universities have been established. He said that Mongolia's national art and literature have achieved brilliant achievements in a short period of time. Cinemas, clubs, and "Red Corners" (entertainment rooms) have been widely established throughout the country. Radio networks have also been established. No matter how remote the grassland is, herders can hear various current affairs reports and beautiful music broadcasted by the radio.
    "The peace-loving Mongolian people know that their selfless labor is promoting peace and consolidating the strength of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. They also know that their economic and cultural achievements are a powerful blow to the arrogant war instigators. Labor emulation is being carried out enthusiastically throughout the country. Ninety percent of workers, engineers, and technicians are involved in this upsurge. Labor models have exceeded 10,000." He said, pointing to the photos of workers and farmers at work he was holding.
    Then, he continued to introduce the Mongolian Trade Union's situation in the struggle for world peace. He said, "The purpose of the Mongolian Trade Union is to consolidate the unity of workers all over the world." Last year, more than 60% of the country's population signed the declaration in support of the conclusion of the Five-Power Peace Pact. When American robbers attacked Korea, the Mongolian people held a national peace conference to protest. In order to assist the just war of the Korean people, three large-scale donation campaigns were carried out in Mongolia. The trade union called on and organized workers to overfulfill their tasks to support the Korean people. All the workers sent the determination to further strive for new victories in production to the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers who are full of confidence in victory.
    He conveyed the Mongolian people's anger at the US imperialists' bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. He said that in Mongolia, even in the most remote areas, mass rallies were held to demand a stop to the use of bacteriological weapons. The broad masses demanded that the inhuman war criminals be brought to international tribunals for trial.
    "I am very happy to come to China to participate in the festival of reviewing the strength of the working people all over the world." Gonbosuren expressed his feelings after participating in the "May Day" celebrations. "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant achievements in politics, economy, and culture in the past three years. This has been fully demonstrated in the 'May Day' parade." He said, "China is Mongolia's good friend and good neighbor. Because of friends like the Soviet Union and New China, the Mongolian people can build and live safely." "The Chinese people led by Mao Zedong are not only the guarantee of peace in the Far East, but also the pillar of world peace!" He conveyed the Mongolian people's understanding of New China in enthusiastic language.
    The Mongolian delegation visited Zhangguozhuang, a suburb of Beijing, on April 30. Gonbosuren said that all the facts tell us that the Chinese people are building their happy lives. The people of Zhangguozhuang were given land after the land reform. In the past three years, some of them have built houses, some have bought cattle and new farm implements, and their children have entered schools (only the children of landlords could enter schools in the past). He said: "The conditions for building socialism have been created in China, because the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, is a reliable guarantee for China to move towards socialism."
    "The best weapon to defend the struggle for world peace is the unity of the working class all over the world, and we must strive to consolidate this unity!" The head of the Mongolian Trade Union delegation ended his conversation with this sentence.

    访蒙古工会代表团团长冈波苏仑
    应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的蒙古工会代表团，给我们带来了蒙古人民对新中国的兄弟般的情谊，还给我们带来了我们友好邻居的最近的消息。
    蒙古工会代表团团长冈波苏仑对记者说：“三十多年前，蒙古是亚洲最落后的国家。那时候，全国连一个学校和一所工厂都没有。”他说，经过三十年的紧张的劳动，现在蒙古已是面目一新了：牲畜的头数比革命前增加了两倍半；工业总产量在最近二十年增加了三百八十倍；由于大规模使用新式农业机器和扩大耕地面积，十年来农业生产增加了百分之六百零四点七；现代化的交通工具已经出现。乌兰巴托尔的机场上，整天都有飞机升降，汽车、摩托车、自行车沿着公路飞驰，火车的汽笛在共和国的北部和东部经常吼叫……。
    他说，革命给劳动人民带来了文化。在蒙古，从前很多人不懂得什么是教育，现在差不多人人都认得字了。数百个中学、小学、技术学校和高等学校已经建立起来。他说，蒙古的民族艺术和文学在短时期内获得了辉煌的成就。全国广泛地设立了电影院、俱乐部和“红角”（娱乐室）。还建立了广播网。牧民们不论走到多么偏远的草原，都可以听到收音机放出的各种时事报告和优美的音乐。
    “爱好和平的蒙古人民知道他们的忘我劳动是促进和平、巩固以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量，也知道他们在经济上、文化上得到的成就对于狂妄的战争挑拨者是一个有力的打击。劳动竞赛正在全国热烈地开展着。有百分之九十的工人、工程师和技术人员卷入了这个热潮。劳动模范已超过一万人。”他指着他手上拿着的正在工作的工人和农民的照片，这样说。
    接着，他继续介绍蒙古工会为世界和平斗争的情况。他说：“蒙古工会是以巩固全世界的工人的团结为目的的。”去年全国有百分之六十多的人口在拥护缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。美国强盗进攻朝鲜时，蒙古人民举行了全国和平大会表示抗议。为了援助朝鲜人民的正义战争，在蒙古进行了三次大规模的捐献运动。工会号召和组织工人超额完成任务，来支援朝鲜人民。全体工人把进一步争取生产上的新胜利的决心寄给怀着必胜信念的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军。
    他传达了蒙古人民对美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的愤怒情绪。他说，在蒙古，甚至连最偏僻的地区，都举行了群众大会，要求制止使用细菌武器。广大群众要求把没有人性的战争罪犯交付国际法庭审判。
    “我能来中国参加检阅全世界劳动人民力量的节日是很幸福的。”冈波苏仑发表了他参加“五一”节观礼后的感想。“中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，三年来无论在政治上、经济上、文化上，都获得了辉煌的成就。这在“五一”节检阅中充分表现出来了。”他说：“中国是蒙古的好朋友，好邻居。因为有了苏联和新中国这样的朋友，蒙古人民可以安全地建设和生活。”“毛泽东领导的中国人民不仅是远东和平的保障，也是全世界和平的支柱！”他用热情的语句传达了蒙古人民对新中国的认识。
    蒙古代表团在四月三十日参观了京郊张郭庄。冈波苏仑说，所有的事实都告诉我们，中国人民正在建设他们幸福的生活。张郭庄的老百姓在土地改革后分到了土地。三年来，他们有的盖了房子，有的买了牛和新式农具，他们的子女进了学校（过去只有地主的子女才能进学校）。他说：“在中国已创立了建设社会主义的条件，因为中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东的领导就是中国走向社会主义的可靠保证。”
    “保卫世界和平斗争的最好的武器，是全世界工人阶级的团结，我们必须为巩固这个团结而努力！”蒙古工会代表团的团长用这句话结束了他的谈话。
