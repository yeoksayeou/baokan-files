Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: Supported by the bayonets of the American occupation forces, the reactionary Yoshida government continues to frantically arrest Japanese patriots. According to statistics from the Japanese police authorities, as of the evening of the 10th, the number of people arrested has reached 618. At the same time, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has issued 700 arrest warrants, and it is expected that the number of those arrested will exceed 1,000 in the future.

While carrying out these arrests, the reactionary Japanese government has also created many new atrocities. On the afternoon of May 8th, two plainclothes policemen illegally infiltrated Tokyo's Waseda University in an attempt to arrest students who participated in the "May Day" demonstration. After their despicable attempt was discovered, it immediately aroused great anger among more than 1,000 students at the school. The students unanimously condemned the illegality of the police infiltrating the school. Under questioning from the students, the plainclothes policemen who infiltrated the school admitted their unreasonableness and wrote a letter of repentance stating "Illegally entered Waseda University on May 8th," expressing their apology to the students. However, at this moment, the police authorities, deliberately looking for trouble, dispatched 500 policemen, armed with clubs and torches, forcibly rushed into Waseda University and arbitrarily beat students who were unarmed. According to United Press International, 107 students were injured by the police, 37 of whom were seriously injured.

This new bloody incident aroused widespread anger among the school's teachers and students. The Dean of the School of Education, Sasaki, openly denounced "the police's attitude as too unreasonable."

    吉田政府继续进行疯狂逮捕
    日警冲入早稻田大学殴伤大批学生
    【新华社十二日讯】东京消息：在美国占领军刺刀支持下的吉田反动政府，继续在疯狂地逮捕日本爱国人士。据日本警察当局统计，截至十日晚上为止，被逮捕的人数已达六百一十八名。同时，东京警视厅已经发出拘票七百名，预计今后被捕者将超过一千名。
    日本反动政府在进行这种逮捕时，又制造了许多新的暴行。八日下午，两名便衣警察非法潜入东京早稻田大学，企图逮捕该校参加“五一”示威游行的学生。这两个警察的卑劣企图被发觉后，立刻激起了该校一千多名学生的极大愤怒。学生们一致指责警察潜入学校的非法性。在学生们的盘问下，潜入该校的便衣警察承认自己的无理，写了一份“五月八日任意进入早大校内”的悔过书，向学生表示道歉。但是，正在这时，蓄意寻衅的警察当局却调来了五百名警察，手执棍棒、火把，强行冲入早稻田大学，并任意殴打赤手空拳的学生。据合众社透露，学生被警察殴伤的达一百零七人，其中有三十七人伤势甚为严重。
    这一新的流血事件，激起了该校教师与学生的普遍愤怒。该校教育学院院长佐佐木公开斥责“警察的态度太无理。”
