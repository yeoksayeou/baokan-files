    Shandong Phosphorus Factory Drying Group Workers
    Use New Operating Method, Can Increase Production by Over 140 Million Yuan Annually
    Editor: The workers of the drying group of Shandong Phosphorus Factory used to have poor communication with each other and did not pay attention to research and technical improvements. When drying phosphorus sulfide, they only loaded a dozen or so liang per tray and flipped it carelessly, and could only dry over two hundred jin per day. Encouraged by the victory of the "Three-Anti" struggle, everyone gave full play to the creativity of the working class, experimented with and applied the "continuous multi-loading phosphorus sulfide operation method," and improved the original method of drying phosphorus sulfide. Using the new operating method, they can load more than one jin and four liang per tray, and by paying attention to even flipping and mastering the temperature, they can dry more than two hundred and ninety jin of phosphorus sulfide per day. This is more than 60% more productive than before, and can increase the value of over 140 million yuan of wealth per year. Zhao Ketong

    山东磷厂干燥组工人
    运用新操作法，每年可增产一亿四千多万元
    编辑同志：山东磷厂干燥组工人，过去彼此联系很差，也不注意研究改进技术。他们干燥硫化磷时，每盘只装十多两，翻得又马虎，每天只能炕干二百多市斤。在“三反”斗争胜利的鼓舞下，大家发挥工人阶级的创造性，试验运用“连续多装硫化磷操作法”，改进了原来的干燥硫化磷方法。他们用了新的操作法，每盘可装一斤四两多，再注意翻得均匀和掌握温度，每天能炕干硫化磷二百九十多斤。这比以前增产百分之六十多，一年可以增产价值一亿四千多万元的财富。赵克同
