    Proof of revolutionary military personnel should include detailed names and addresses

    Comrade Editor: Some revolutionary military personnel certificates, victory reports, and certificates of revolutionary military personnel's sacrifice or death from illness, sent by the political departments of the major military regions and troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have been received by us. Because the addresses and names are incomplete or incorrect, they cannot be found, and cannot be delivered to the relevant family members, which affects the progress of preferential treatment work. For example, a certificate of sacrifice for a revolutionary soldier (Ke Wangshan) and a certificate of death from illness for a revolutionary soldier (Fei Chenghua) sent to our county by the Political Department of the Southwest Military Region only stated Tongbai County, Henan Province, and did not specify which district or township. The name of the martyred hero, "Ke Wangshan," is probably also written incorrectly. After receiving these two certificates, our county continuously inquired in various districts and published them several times in our county's "News Express," but they have not yet been delivered to the relevant family members. Some letters also incorrectly wrote "Tongbai County" as "Tongbei County," which caused even greater difficulties. I suggest that all relevant parties should carefully clarify the names, origins, and family addresses of revolutionary military personnel when filling them out, so as to deliver them in a timely manner. Wang Qingzhou

    Editor's Note: The General Political Department Organization Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission has sent a letter requesting that the civil affairs departments of the people's governments of all counties immediately send the undeliverable revolutionary military personnel certificates, victory reports, and certificates of revolutionary military personnel's sacrifice or death from illness, etc., to the department, so that they can be returned to the original department for re-filling the names and addresses.

    投寄有关革命军人的证明书应该详实填写姓名地址
    编辑同志：我们收到的一些中国人民解放军各大军区政治部、部队寄来的革命军人证明书、喜报和革命军人牺牲、病故的证明书，因为地址、姓名不详或有错误，无从查询，不能交给有关家属，以致影响到优抚工作的进行。如西南军区政治部寄到我县的一份革命军人（科王山）牺牲证明书和一份革命军人（费城华）病故证明书，都只写了河南省桐柏县，并没有写明那区那乡。牺牲烈士的姓名“科王山”恐怕也是写错了。我县接到这两份证明书后，就连续向各区查问，并在我县“新闻快报”上登载了几次，但到现在还无法递交给有关家属。还有的信把“桐柏县”写成“通北县”，这就造成了更大的困难。我建议，各有关方面在填写革命军人姓名、籍贯、家属住址等时，要详细搞清楚，以便及时投递。    王清洲
