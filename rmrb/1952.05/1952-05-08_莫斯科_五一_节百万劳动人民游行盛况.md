    Moscow's Grand May Day Parade of a Million Workers

    On May 1st, over a million working people in Moscow held a grand demonstration. The streets were filled with red flags and flowers under the spring sunshine. Endless streams of people poured towards the city center – Red Square and the walls of the Kremlin. Leading the parade were nationally renowned industrial innovators, scientists, and cultural workers. They marched under the fluttering flags. Following them was a contingent of youth and Young Pioneers marching past Lenin's Mausoleum. A little girl, holding a bouquet of flowers, left the ranks, ascended the reviewing stand, and presented flowers to Stalin. A wave of cheers resounded across the square.

    One column after another entered Red Square to the sound of resounding music. Tens of thousands of flags and banners formed a colorful ocean. Everywhere in the ranks were red flags, large portraits of Lenin and Stalin, and portraits of the leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government. Many columns held long banners displaying the May Day slogans of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party.

    The demonstrators warmly greeted the foreign guests on the reviewing stand – representatives from China, Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, the United States, Canada, Australia, Finland, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Brazil, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Iceland, France, Albania, Britain, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and other countries. The demonstrators held high portraits of Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Vice-Chairman Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, and Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as portraits of leaders of various people's democratic countries – Bierut, Cyrankiewicz, Gottwald, Zapotocky, Chervenkov, Damianov, Rákosi, Dobi, Rónai, Gheorghiu-Dej, Groza, Bahon, Hoxha, Nishani, and others. The demonstrators paid tribute to the unyielding Korean people who are fighting against foreign aggressors and valiantly defending the freedom and independence of their motherland. They held high the portraits of Korean leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Tu-bong. Many slogans paid tribute to the democratic forces of Germany who are striving for a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany. The demonstrators held high portraits of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, Prime Minister Grotewohl, and Walter Ulbricht, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The demonstrators also held high the portrait of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the portraits of French people's leader Thorez, Italian people's leader Togliatti, American revolutionary working-class leader Foster, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party Ibarruri, and General Secretary of the British Communist Party Pollitt.

    Tens of thousands of workers, peasants, scientists, writers, artists, and students marched mightily across Red Square. The slogans and banners in the parade reflected the achievements of the Soviet working people in building communism. Workers from many factories held high portraits of Stakhanovite workers and brightly colored charts illustrating their achievements. Many banners reported on the remarkable achievements of the workers in welcoming May Day. Workers from the "Red Proletarian" factory carried a model of the unified automated machine tool they produced on the eve of May Day. Construction workers carried models of various grand buildings and large paintings of new residential areas in Moscow. The music and cheers on Red Square rose and fell, interwoven into a single sound. The demonstration lasted for more than six hours before it came to an end.

    莫斯科“五一”节百万劳动人民游行盛况
    五月一日，莫斯科一百多万劳动人民举行了盛大的示威游行。在春天阳光照耀着的街道上，到处是红旗和鲜花。无穷尽的人流涌向市中心——红场和克里姆林宫的城垣。走在游行队伍最前列的是闻名全国的工业革新者、科学家和文化工作者。他们在起伏飘扬的旗帜下行进。接着是一队青年和少年先锋队的队伍走过列宁墓。一个小女孩拿着一束鲜花离开行列，登上检阅台，向斯大林献花。一片欢呼声响遍会场。
    一队又一队的游行行列在宏亮的乐声中进入红场。千万面旗帜和标语牌汇成了一片彩色的海洋。队伍里到处飘展着红旗，到处都是列宁、斯大林的大画像和布尔什维克党和苏联政府领袖的画像。许多队伍并举着横幅的长旗，上面写着布尔什维克党中央委员会的“五一”节口号。
    游行者向看台上的外国来宾——中国、朝鲜、蒙古、越南、美国、加拿大、澳大利亚、芬兰、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、巴西、意大利、比利时、奥地利、冰岛、法国、阿尔巴尼亚、英国、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦等国观礼代表，热烈致敬。游行者高举着中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东、副主席朱德、政务院总理周恩来、中国共产党中央委员会书记刘少奇的画像，以及各人民民主国家领袖——贝鲁特、西伦凯维兹、哥特瓦尔德、萨波托斯基、契尔文科夫、达米扬诺夫、拉科西、道比、罗奈伊、乔治乌—德治、格罗查、巴洪、霍查、尼沙尼等人的画像。示威者向正在与外国侵略者作战、英勇保卫祖国自由和独立的刚毅不屈的朝鲜人民致敬。他们高举着朝鲜人民领袖金日成和金枓奉的画像。许多标语向正在为争取统一、独立、民主、和平的德国而奋斗的德国民主力量致敬。示威者高举着德意志民主共和国总统皮克、总理格罗提渥和德国统一社会党中央委员会总书记乌布利希的画像。示威者还高举着越南民主共和国主席胡志明的画像，和法国人民领袖多列士、意大利人民领袖托里亚蒂、美国革命工人阶级领袖福斯特、西班牙共产党中央委员会总书记伊巴露丽、英国共产党总书记波立特的画像。
    成千成万的工人、农民、科学家、作家、艺术家和学生浩浩荡荡地走过红场。游行队伍中标语旗帜等等反映了正在建设共产主义的苏联劳动人民的成就，许多工厂的工人还在行列里高举着斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的画像，举着颜色鲜明的说明成绩的图表。许多标语牌报告了职工们迎接“五一”节的显著成就。“红色无产者”工厂的工人抬着他们在“五一”节前夕所生产的统一自动操作工作母机的模型。建筑工人抬着种种宏伟楼房的模型和莫斯科新住宅区的大画。红场上的奏乐声和欢呼声此伏彼起，交织成一片。示威游行继续了六个多钟头才告结束。
