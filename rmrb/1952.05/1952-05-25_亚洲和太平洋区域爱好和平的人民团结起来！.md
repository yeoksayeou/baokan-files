People of Asia and the Pacific Region Unite for Peace!
Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs

If, after the end of World War II, the victorious nations had been able to handle the major post-war issues in accordance with the various solemn international agreements concluded during the war, such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Yalta Agreement, how much prosperity and progress would seven years of peaceful construction have brought to the world by now! Unfortunately, the American imperialists, intoxicated by the dream of dominating the world, only cared about expanding their hegemony and disregarded the survival interests of the people of all countries. For seven years, they have continuously and increasingly engaged in various war preparations, attempting to enslave the people of the world, so that today, not only have the various ideals cherished by the people of all countries at the end of World War II become empty dreams, but the entire world is also in a state of anxiety.

Leaving aside the other evils of the American imperialists over the past seven years, in the Far East, they launched the Korean War two years ago, occupied China's Taiwan, and obstructed China's entry into the United Nations. Since last year, they have again manufactured a unilateral peace treaty with Japan, signed the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," and rearmed Japan, attempting to turn Japan into a tool for American imperialist aggression against Asian and Pacific countries. Recently, regarding the Korean armistice negotiations, they have not only completely adopted the vulgar tactics of Chicago gangsters, delaying and sabotaging in every possible way, but even used inhuman bacteriological warfare to threaten the survival of the vast population. In addition, the continuation of the Vietnam War is entirely due to the American imperialists backing their French lackeys; the widespread network of military bases is nothing more than an attempt to encircle people's countries; and deceiving Iran out of its oil is also for the purpose of launching wars.

All this clearly indicates that today, Asia and the Pacific region, like other parts of the world, is under the serious threat of a larger-scale war of aggression, and the American imperialists are the masterminds of this larger-scale war of aggression. In other words, today, all the good people in the world want peace, only the warmongering American imperialists want war. In order to maintain and expand the interests of a small number of people on Wall Street, the American imperialists do not hesitate to be enemies with the people of Asian and Pacific countries, and do not hesitate to be enemies with the people of the whole world (including the American people).

The people of Asian countries have fresh memories of imperialist oppression, and even now, many countries have not completely broken their chains. All countries that have unfortunately been colonies or semi-colonies since the Eastern invasion of imperialism, after enduring long-term suffering, hope to restore their national independence and freedom, and hope to restore their dignity as human beings. Not only do they hope, but in reality, not a single Asian nation is not engaged in a long and arduous struggle to achieve this sacred goal. China is one of the countries that has recently achieved independence and freedom after a long and arduous struggle. Imperialism must be overthrown, colonialism must be eliminated, and the independence and autonomy of all oppressed nations must be fully restored. This is the goal that the people of Asian countries have been striving for for a long time, and it is also something that the people of Asian countries absolutely do not allow to happen again.

The American imperialists' policy in Asia today is to increasingly sacrifice the people of Asian countries to maintain and expand Wall Street's profits. This is a blind and wishful thinking of the American imperialists, and it is a muddled dream that they will never be able to realize. The reason is very simple: the awakened people of Asia will never allow others to ride on their heads again. The people of China, the people of Korea, the people of Vietnam, and the people of Malaya are just a few prominent examples. All other nations that have been oppressed by imperialism are also determined to resist the new aggression of the gold standard empire and to eliminate the new threats from the new barbarians.

However, having determination alone is not enough, and isolated resistance is also not enough. If we want to successfully resist the new aggression of the American imperialists and successfully eliminate the new threats of the American imperialists, we must unite, organize, raise our vigilance, and strengthen our strength. The enemy's conspiracies can be completely shattered, and the enemy's aggression can be completely defeated; but we must have close unity and strong organization to achieve this goal easily. Recently, eleven people in our country, including Song Qingling and Guo Moruo, who are committed to the cause of peace, jointly sent a telegram inviting peace-loving people from all countries to jointly initiate the "Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference" for this purpose. The invited peace-loving people from various countries have enthusiastically responded to this call and are preparing to hold a preparatory meeting for this peace conference in Beijing soon. We wish the preparatory meeting and the subsequent official meeting complete success. If we can unite closely and fight bravely, peace can certainly be maintained and war can certainly be prevented.

### 亚洲和太平洋区域爱好和平的人民团结起来！

    亚洲和太平洋区域爱好和平的人民团结起来！
    中国人民外交学会会长　张奚若
    当第二次世界大战结束后，战胜各国如都能按照战争期间所订各种庄严的国际协定，如开罗宣言、波茨坦公告、雅尔达协定等，处理战后各种重大问题，那到现在，七年的和平建设，将为全世界带来多大的繁荣和进步！不幸沉醉于独霸世界迷梦的美国帝国主义者只顾扩张他们的霸权，不管世界各国人民的生存利益，七年以来继续不断地，一步紧一步地，作种种战争准备，企图奴役世界人民，以致今日不但世界各国人民在第二次世界大战结束时所抱各种理想尽成泡影，而且使整个世界杌陧不安。
    美国帝国主义者七年以来在其他方面的罪恶姑且不提，在远东，它两年以前发动朝鲜战争，侵占中国台湾，并阻挠中国进入联合国。去年以来又复制造片面对日和约，签订美日“行政协定”，重新武装日本，企图使日本变成美帝国主义侵略亚洲和太平洋区域各国的工具。最近对于朝鲜停战谈判，不但完全采取芝加哥市井无赖的下流伎俩，多方拖延和破坏，甚至使用违反人道的细菌战，来威胁广大人民的生存。此外，越南战争的继续，全因美国帝国主义者为其法国走狗撑腰；在各处遍布军事基地网，无非是要包围人民国家；骗取伊朗石油，也是为了发动战争。
    凡此种种，都极明显地指出，今日亚洲和太平洋区域，正如世界其他各处一样，全在一种更大规模的侵略战争的严重威胁之中，而美国帝国主义者乃是这个更大规模的侵略战争的主谋犯。换句话说，今日全世界的善良人民都要和平，只有穷兵黩武的美国帝国主义者要战争。美国帝国主义者为了维持和扩大华尔街少数人的利益，不惜与亚洲和太平洋各国人民为敌，不惜与全世界人民（包括美国人民在内）为敌。
    亚洲各国人民对于帝国主义的压迫是记忆犹新的，甚至现在还有许多国家未能完全打破其锁链的。凡是在帝国主义东侵以来不幸曾为殖民地或半殖民地的国家，在长期备尝痛苦滋味之后，无不希望恢复其民族的独立与自由，无不希望恢复其做人的尊严。不但希望，实际上没有一个亚洲民族不为实现此种神圣目的而作长期的艰苦斗争。中国就是经过长期艰苦斗争最近才获得独立自由的国家之一。帝国主义必须打倒，殖民主义必须消灭，各被压迫民族的独立自主必须完全恢复。这是亚洲各国人民久在奋斗的目标，这也是亚洲各国人民所绝对不容许再出现的事情。
    美国帝国主义者今日在亚洲的政策，是变本加厉地拿亚洲各国人民做维持和扩大华尔街利润的牺牲品。这是美国帝国主义者瞎了眼睛、想入非非的勾当，这是他们绝对无法实现的糊涂梦。理由甚为简单：觉醒了的亚洲人民绝对不容许别人再来骑在他们头上。中国人民，朝鲜人民，越南人民，马来亚人民只是几个突出的例子，其他凡是受过帝国主义压迫的民族，也都有决心去抵抗金圆帝国的新侵略，去消灭新野蛮人的新威胁。
    不过光有决心固然不行，孤立抵抗也是不够的。我们如欲胜利地抵抗美国帝国主义者的新侵略，成功地消灭美国帝国主义者的新威胁，我们就必须团结起来，组织起来，提高我们的警惕，加强我们的力量。敌人的阴谋是能够彻底粉碎的，敌人的侵略是能够完全打败的；但我们必须有紧密的团结和坚强的组织，这个目的才容易达到。最近我国努力于和平事业的人士宋庆龄、郭沫若等十一人联名电邀各国爱好和平的人士共同发起“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”就是为的这个目的。现在被邀请的各国爱好和平的人士已经热烈地响应了这个号召，并准备最近在北京举行这个和平会议的筹备会议。我们预祝这个筹备会议和以后的正式会议完全成功。我们如能紧密地团结起来，勇敢地斗争下去，和平是一定可以保持的，战争是一定可以防止的。
