    "Read Newspapers in the Fields" Movement Widely Launched
    Shanxi Peasants Universally Increase Newspaper Subscriptions
    Comrade Editor: In order to promptly absorb advanced production experience and launch the patriotic production increase competition movement, peasants throughout Shanxi Province increased their newspaper subscriptions by 10,500 copies before May Day. This is also the result of the vigorous promotion of the "Read Newspapers in the Fields" movement by the Shanxi Peasant News. Ping顺 County had only 685 reading groups last year, but this year it has increased to 1,502. The county originally subscribed to 506 copies of the Shanxi Peasant News, but now it has increased to 1,509 copies. In the fifth district of Yangcheng County, peasants subscribed to 306 copies of the Shanxi Daily, Shanxi Peasant News, and Shanxi Youth News in March of this year, but during the busy spring plowing season in April, this increased to 783 copies, an average of one newspaper for every eleven people.
    The "Read Newspapers in the Fields" method has been welcomed by the vast number of peasants. The quick-clapper rhyme composed by the Liulin reading group in Zuoquan County says: "Newspaper goes to the field, take a break and talk about issues, production and learning, combined together." The Yangyaogou reading group in Xiangyuan County also composed similar lyrics: "Everyone listens to the newspaper in the field, doesn't delay production and opens the mind. Can know national affairs, and clearly talk about production experience. Everyone participates in the reading group, guaranteeing patriotism and increased production." These lyrics fully reflect the peasants' concern for the newspaper reading movement.

    “地头读报”运动广泛开展
    山西农民普遍增订报纸
    编辑同志：为了及时吸取先进生产经验，开展爱国丰产竞赛运动，山西全省农民在“五一”前，增订报纸一万零五百份。这也是山西农民报大力推动“地头读报”运动的结果。平顺县在去年只有六百八十五个读报组，今年已增加到一千五百零二个；该县原订山西农民报五百零六份，现在则已增加到
    一千五百零九份。阳城县五区的农民，在今年三月份订有山西日报、山西农民报、山西青年报三百零六份，到四月份春耕紧张时，增加到七百八十三份，平均每十一个人有一份报纸。
    “地头读报”的办法受到了广大农民的欢迎。左权柳林读报组编出的快板说：“报纸上了地，休息谈问题，生产和学习，结合在一起。”襄垣羊窑沟读报组也编了类似的歌词：“地里读报大家听，不误生产开脑筋。国家大事能知道，生产经验讲得清。人人参加读报组，爱国丰产有保证。”这些歌词，充分反映了农民对于读报运动的关心。
