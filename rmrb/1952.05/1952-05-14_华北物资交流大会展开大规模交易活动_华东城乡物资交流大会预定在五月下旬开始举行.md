    The North China Materials Exchange Conference is currently engaged in large-scale trading activities. As of the 7th of this month, the total transaction volume exceeded 240 billion yuan, achieving significant success in promoting local specialty products. For example, North China sold over 20 million jin of various cottonseeds, rapeseed, etc., more than 80,000 live pigs, and over 9 million eggs. Industrial products such as cloth and daily necessities also saw substantial transactions, with Tianjin Department Store alone purchasing towels, socks, and other items from East China cooperatives, reaching a transaction value of 3.6 billion yuan.
    Since the opening of the exchange conference on April 23rd, trade delegations organized by various provinces, cities, and special districts in the North China region have arrived in Tianjin successively. Trade delegations from the Northeast, Central South, and East China major administrative regions also arrived in recent days to participate in the conference's transactions. Transactions are conducted in the spirit of "having both buying and selling," "buying and selling more," and "mutual assistance and benefit." All trading units adhere to the principle of "buying before selling, combining buying and selling" in their transactions. To alleviate difficulties in transactions and achieve the goal of "buying and selling more," the conference has adopted a variety of transaction methods. In addition to spot transactions with cash, spot transactions with deferred payment, futures contracts, barter trade, consignment sales, and triangular exchange contracts, it has also created agency purchase and joint purchase-joint sales transaction methods. For example, Tianjin's pork industry and Beijing Native Produce Company jointly purchased 55,000 live pigs from Hebei Province. The North China Oil Company ordered 9,000 tons of rapeseed from the North China Cooperative General Agency's Business Office, adopting the agency purchase method, with the former providing funds and the latter acting as an agent to purchase, with the buyer paying a certain handling fee and delivering the goods within a specified time. The transaction between Beijing Native Produce Company and Suiyuan Province Native Produce Company for 3,000 cattle and 20,000 sheep, due to the varying sizes of the cattle and sheep and the difficulty in pricing, adopted the method of joint purchase and joint sales, with both parties contributing funds for joint operation. Suiyuan Province Native Produce Company is responsible for purchasing, and Beijing Native Produce Company is responsible for sales. The resulting profits and losses are shared equally by both parties. These transaction methods have greatly invigorated the conference's transactions.
    The leading role of the state-owned economy is fully demonstrated in the transactions. Tianjin Trust Company exchanged 60,000 jin of brown sugar for over 120,000 jin of slow-selling Glauber's salt from Hebei Province. Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory purchased a large quantity of mirabilite, playing a role in opening up sales channels for slow-selling local products. The state-owned economy further drives private enterprises to engage in purchase and sales through joint ventures with private businesses. For example, Tianjin Native Produce Company and Tianjin Import and Export Industry jointly purchased a batch of black melon seeds from Hebei Province.
    To promote large-scale transactions, the Exchange Conference Committee has continuously held various symposiums, inviting heads of trade delegations from various regions to participate in discussions, exchange purchasing and sales plans of various units, and conduct planned transactions. In addition, the Contract Agreement Inspection Committee of the Exchange Conference has inspected the implementation of contracts and agreements signed by various units last year, urging and assisting various units to strictly implement them as soon as possible, and criticizing those who have not implemented them, thereby strengthening the sense of responsibility of the representatives of various trade delegations for signing and implementing contracts, and ensuring the strict implementation of contracts in the future.

    In order to further expand urban-rural materials exchange and invigorate urban-rural economy, the Financial and Economic Committee of the East China Military and Administrative Committee decided to convene an urban-rural materials exchange conference in Shanghai. The conference is scheduled to start from May 25th and last for ten days to half a month, and will be extended if necessary. Public and private enterprises from various parts of the East China region will send representatives to participate in the conference, and other major administrative regions and major cities will also be invited to send representatives to participate.
    The central task of the conference is to vigorously organize and promote the exchange of local products and organize the transfer of urban industrial products to the countryside, inspect the implementation of contracts signed by various regions and units after the East China Local Products Conference and the Shanghai Local Products Exchange Exhibition last year, further promote and organize materials exchange from the perspective of new production and sales situations, and solve the existing problems. Therefore, the transaction method of this conference is determined to focus on spot goods and short-term futures, and also welcome the use of consignment sales or joint purchase and joint sales methods to promote exchange.
    The Preparatory Committee for the East China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Conference, which is in charge of preparing for this conference, was officially established on May 8th and has begun its work. The committee is composed of 27 people, including the main responsible persons of state-owned trading departments and cooperatives at the East China and Shanghai levels, as well as representatives from private industrial and commercial circles. The East China Financial and Economic Committee has sent senior responsible cadres from the Planning Bureau, the Trade Department, and the East China Branch of the People's Bank to inspect various provinces and regions, study the production and sales of various materials in various regions, so as to formulate exchange plans and prepare for the conference.

### 华北物资交流大会展开大规模交易活动  华东城乡物资交流大会预定在五月下旬开始举行

    华北物资交流大会展开大规模交易活动
    华东城乡物资交流大会预定在五月下旬开始举行
    华北区物资交流大会现正展开大规模交易活动。截至本月七日止，共成交二千四百多亿元，在推销土特产方面获得很大成绩。如华北销出各种棉籽、菜籽等二千多万斤，活猪八万多口，鸡蛋九百多万个。布匹、日用百货等工业品也有大批成交，仅天津市百货公司购进华东区合作社毛巾、袜子等一项交易额即达三十六亿元。
    交流大会四月二十三日开幕以来，华北区各省、市、专区分别组织的贸易代表团即先后抵天津，东北、中南、华东等大行政区贸易代表团也于日前先后到达，参加大会交易。成交业务是在“有买有卖”、“多买多卖”和“互助两利”的精神下进行的。各贸易单位都本着“先购后销、购销结合”的交易原则进行成交。为解除交易中的困难，达到“多买多卖”的方针，该会在交易中采取了多种多样的交易方式，除现货现款、现货期款、定购期货、以货换货、赊销代销、三角交换合同等方式外，并创造了代购和联购联销的交易方式。如天津猪肉业和北京土产公司联合购进河北省的活猪五万五千口，华北区油脂公司向华北合作总社推销经营处订购的九千吨油菜籽，就采取了代购方式，由前者出资，由后者代为采购，购方付出一定的手续费，限在一定时间内交货。北京市土产公司向绥远省土产公司洽购的牛三千头、羊两万只的交易，由于牛羊大小不一，计价困难，就采取了联购联销的方式，由双方出资合营，绥远省土产公司负责收购，北京市土产公司负责推销，经营结果，盈亏由双方平均分担。这些交易方式使大会交易大大活跃起来。
    在成交中充分显示出国营经济的领导作用。天津市信托公司以青糖六万斤换河北省滞销的火硝十二万多斤，天津染整厂收购了大批芒硝，对打开滞销土产销路起了推动作用。国营经济更通过和私商合资采购的方式，带动私营企业进行购销。如天津市土产公司和天津市进出口业曾合资购进了河北省的黑瓜子一批。
    为促进大规模成交，交流大会委员会曾连续举行了各种座谈会，邀请各地贸易代表团团长参加座谈，交换各单位购销计划，进行有计划的成交。此外，交流大会所属合同协议检查委员会并检查各单位去年所签订的合同、协议执行情况，督促和协助各单位早日严格执行，对未执行的单位予以批评，因而加强了各贸易团代表对签订合同、执行合同的责任心，保证了今后合同的严格执行。

    为进一步扩大城乡物资交流，活跃城乡经济，华东军政委员会财政经济委员会决定在上海市召开城乡物资交流大会。会期预定自五月二十五日起，连开十天到半个月，必要时将予延长。华东区区内各地公私企业将派代表参加大会，其他各大行政区、各大城市也将应邀派代表参加。
    大会的中心任务是大力组织推动土产交流和组织城市工业品下乡，检查去年华东区土产会议和上海市土产交流展览大会后各地各单位所订合同的执行情况，从新的产销情况出发，进一步推动和组织物资交流，并解决所存在的问题。因此，这次大会的交易方式决定以现货和短期期货为主，并也欢迎以委托代销或联购联销的办法来推动交流。
    主持筹备这次大会的华东城乡物资交流大会筹备委员会已于五月八日正式成立，且已开始办公。委员会是由华东和上海市两级国营贸易部门及合作社的主要负责人和私营工商界代表等二十七人组成的。华东财政经济委员会已派出计划局、贸易部及人民银行华东区行等部门的高级负责干部代表财政经济委员会前往各省区视察，研究各地各种物资产销情况，以便制定交流方案，为大会作好准备工作。
