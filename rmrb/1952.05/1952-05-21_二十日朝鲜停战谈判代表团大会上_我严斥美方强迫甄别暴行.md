Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 20th: At the twentieth meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, our chief representative General Nam Il pointed out that the absurd propositions of the other side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" and so-called "screening," which directly violate international law and the Geneva Convention, have been completely bankrupt and irreparable in the face of undeniable facts. The other side blatantly distorts our consistent proposition of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war so that they can return home to live peaceful lives, falsely claiming that we had "tacitly approved" their screening, but this only shows how despicable the vile means taken by the other side in desperation have become. The other side cannot deny the facts of using violence against our captured personnel, forcibly conducting screening, and attempting to detain our captured personnel to serve as cannon fodder. All threats and atrocities from the other side cannot shake the firm will of our captured personnel to return home and live peaceful lives. The other side must bear full and absolute responsibility for every evil and illegal action taken against our captured personnel. General Nam Il spoke twice as follows:

	"The unshakable fact is that our captured personnel would rather die than submit to your plot to detain them and use them as your cannon fodder. The unshakable fact is that the public confession of your prisoner-of-war camp commanders to the world has completely buried the myth of so-called refusal of repatriation by our captured personnel. Our captured personnel, regardless of all your threats and violence, have launched heroic and righteous resistance against your forced screening activities. Your prisoner-of-war camp commanders have had to confess to the people of the world about your inhumane treatment and massacre atrocities against our captured personnel, and the criminal and illegal acts of forced screening and forced rearmament. What qualifications do you have to propose the principle of so-called 'voluntary repatriation'? What qualifications do you have to propose so-called screening? After the cessation of hostilities, the release and repatriation by both sides of all prisoners of war they have detained is the only reasonable principle for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. The so-called 'voluntary repatriation' proposition itself violates all international law and the explicit provisions of the Geneva Convention, and violates the natural desire of prisoners of war to return home and live peaceful lives. In order to prevent the detaining party from detaining the prisoners of war in its custody in the name of 'voluntary repatriation,' the Geneva Convention explicitly stipulates that the prisoner of war himself shall not declare the renunciation of his right to repatriation, and therefore does not allow any screening activity. Our consistent proposition on the prisoner-of-war issue and the solution that allows prisoners of war on both sides to return home and live peaceful lives are fully in line with the provisions of international law and the Geneva Convention, and in line with the interests and demands of prisoners of war on both sides. We have consistently and firmly opposed, and will continue to firmly oppose, the principle of so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' and all forms of screening activities arising therefrom. We have consistently opposed and will continue to firmly oppose any unreasonable proposition to detain our captured personnel to serve as your cannon fodder. When your so-called 'voluntary repatriation' and so-called 'screening' have been declared a complete failure in the face of unshakable facts, you are still desperately trying to salvage your unreasonable proposition, falsely claiming that our prisoner-of-war policy statement of April 6 tacitly approved your screening activities. On the contrary, our prisoner-of-war policy statement fully demonstrates our consistent stance of firmly opposing the so-called 'voluntary repatriation' and so-called 'screening,' and points out that you must bear full responsibility for all illegal acts committed to detain our captured personnel. Our prisoner-of-war policy statement of April 6 explicitly pointed out that 'The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have always maintained that after the cessation of active hostilities, the belligerent parties should promptly release and repatriate all prisoners of war held by each side. This reasonable proposition will not be changed because some of our captured personnel have tattooed their arms, written certain documents, or performed other similar acts during their detention. We know that these acts are by no means voluntary on their part and should not be held responsible for them.' What point in our statement does not fundamentally oppose your screening activities? Your clumsy means of blatantly distorting the facts only serve to show how base you have become in order to salvage the absurd proposition of so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' which has been completely bankrupt. No distortion or slander can distort our consistent stance of firmly opposing the so-called 'voluntary repatriation' and so-called 'screening.' In fact, only you have been engaging in shameful acts of going back on your word and eating your own words at this conference. You have repeatedly stated in the secret meetings of agenda item four that you are willing to resolve the issue within the framework of our proposal of March 21, but you have overturned your own explicit statements, insisted on your unilateral and unreasonable proposition of detaining our captured personnel, and refused to negotiate on a reasonable basis to resolve the prisoner-of-war issue, which is the only obstacle to the Korean armistice. No matter what barbaric methods you adopt, the righteous voices of our captured personnel resisting your forced screening and forced detention and appealing to the world will not be erased. No matter what shameful means you adopt, the confession of your prisoner-of-war camp commanders openly admitting your criminal and illegal acts to the world cannot be retracted. Your absurd proposition of so-called 'voluntary repatriation' has completely failed and cannot be salvaged. For the progress of the meeting, you must withdraw your proposition to detain our captured personnel to serve as your cannon fodder and accept our May 2 plan as the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue, so that all prisoners of war can return home and live peaceful lives."

	"As I have pointed out many times, any so-called screening of our captured personnel by you is an act aimed at detaining our captured personnel, depriving prisoners of war of their right to repatriation, and violating the Geneva Convention and all international laws of war. We have consistently refuted and opposed it, and will continue to refute and oppose it. Any so-called re-screening proposed by you is for the purpose of detaining our personnel, and any method of detaining our captured personnel is unacceptable. Only when you abandon your fantasies of so-called screening or re-screening and stop depriving prisoners of war of their right to repatriation can the prisoner-of-war issue be resolved. All the facts prove that you have used violence against our captured personnel to forcibly conduct screening, attempting to detain our captured personnel to serve as your cannon fodder. Our captured personnel, in order to oppose forced screening and to refuse to serve as your cannon fodder, risked being collectively massacred and righteously demanded 'immediate cessation of forced screening... rearmament or permanent illegal enslavement.' Even your former prisoner-of-war camp commanders had to publicly guarantee that they would no longer 'conduct forced screening or any rearmament actions.' Is this not clear evidence that you have conducted forced screening? Our captured personnel righteously demanded that you 'immediately stop barbaric acts, insults, torture, coercion, forced writing of blood letters, threats, confinement, collective massacres,' and other criminal acts that completely violate the Geneva Convention and violate the minimum standards of human behavior. Your former prisoner-of-war camp commanders even explicitly stated, 'I admit that many prisoners of war have been killed or injured by United Nations forces, and I guarantee that there will be humane treatment in the future. I myself will be responsible for any future atrocities.' Does this not prove that you have incurred countless blood debts by resorting to violence for the sake of screening? These ironclad facts have been forever recorded as the ugliest page in human history and can never be erased by you. You dare not face these undeniable facts, you cannot answer the questions I have raised, but you brazenly claim that you have answered outside the tent. What is your answer outside the tent? Within days of your prisoner-of-war camp commanders making these guarantees, your commander blatantly tore up this guarantee of the minimum conditions for the treatment of prisoners of war, making it clear that you would continue to use violence, continue to forcibly conduct screening, continue to forcibly conduct rearmament, and continue to attempt to detain our captured personnel to serve as your cannon fodder. Your current prisoner-of-war camp commanders even call your inhumane treatment of our captured personnel 'too lenient' and clamor 'to make the prisoners of war realize that we are tough.' You have dispatched a large number of troops and tanks to the location of your prisoner-of-war camps to further suppress the righteous resistance of our captured personnel. This is your answer outside this tent, but you must bear full and absolute responsibility for every action you take against our captured personnel outside this tent. Every deceptive argument and lie you have made within this tent has been completely shattered by the facts known to the people of the world outside this tent. What qualifications do you have to propose 'basic human rights' and 'individual dignity' here? What qualifications do you have to continue to propose the principle of so-called 'voluntary repatriation' here? What qualifications do you have to continue to propose so-called 'screening' here? What qualifications do you have to propose so-called 'joint public re-screening' here? For the progress of the meeting, you must completely abandon your unilateral and unreasonable proposition to detain our captured personnel."

    二十日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    我严斥美方强迫甄别暴行
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军指出：对方所谓“自愿遣返”、所谓“甄别”的直接违反国际公法和日内瓦公约的荒谬主张，已在不容否认的事实面前彻底破产而无可挽救。对方公然歪曲我方释放与遣返全部战俘使他们得以回家过和平生活的一贯主张，诬称我方曾“默认”对方的甄别，但只是说明了对方在绝望之中所采取的恶劣手段已经低落到如何卑鄙的程度。对方无从否认对我方被俘人员使用暴力，强迫进行甄别，企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的事实。对方一切威胁与暴行不能动摇我方被俘人员归返家园过和平生活的坚决意志。对方必须对于我方被俘人员所采取每一罪恶非法行动负完全的绝对的责任。南日将军两次发言如下：
    “不可动摇的事实是我方被俘人员宁死不屈于你方企图扣留他们充当你方炮灰的阴谋。不可动摇的事实是你方战俘营长官向全世界的公开招供彻底地埋葬了所谓我方被俘人员拒绝遣返的神话。我方被俘人员不顾你方一切的威胁与暴力，对你方强迫进行的甄别活动，掀起了英勇正义的反抗。你方战俘营长官不得不向全世界人民招供你方对我方被俘人员的非人道待遇和屠杀暴行，强迫进行甄别，强迫进行重新武装的罪恶非法行为。你们还有什么资格提出所谓‘自愿遣返’的原则？你们还有什么资格提出所谓甄别？敌对行为终止后，双方释放并遣返其所收容的全部战俘是解决战俘问题的唯一合理原则。所谓‘自愿遣返’的主张，本身就违反了一切国际公法和日内瓦公约的明确规定，违反了战俘回家过和平生活的天然愿望。为了防止收容战俘的一方以‘自愿遣返’之名，扣留其所收容的战俘，日内瓦公约更明确规定战俘本人不得宣布放弃其遣返的权利，因而也不容许有任何甄别的活动。我方在战俘问题上的一贯主张和使双方战俘得以回家过和平生活的解决方案，是完全符合于国际公法和日内瓦公约的规定，符合于双方战俘的利益和要求的。我方一贯坚决反对并将继续坚决反对所谓‘自愿遣返’的原则，以及由此而来的一切形式下的甄别活动。我方一贯反对并将继续坚决反对任何企图扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰的无理主张。当你方所谓‘自愿遣返’和所谓‘甄别’已在不可动摇的事实面前宣告彻底破产后，你们却仍然绝望地企图挽回你方的无理主张，诬称我方四月六日的战俘政策声明默认了你方的甄别活动。正好相反，我方战俘政策声明充分地证明了我方坚决反对所谓‘自愿遣返’和所谓‘甄别’的一贯立场，指出了你方必须对于一切为了扣留我方被俘人员所进行的非法行为负全部的责任。我方四月六日的战俘政策声明明确指出‘朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一向主张在积极的敌对行为停止后，交战双方应迅速释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘。这种合理主张，绝不因我方被俘人员在拘留期间，曾有一部分人在臂上刺字，或写下某种文件，或作其他类似的行为而有所改变。我们深知这些行为绝非出于他们的自愿，不应由他们负责’。我方的声明中有那一点不是根本反对你方的甄别活动的？你方这种公然歪曲事实的拙劣手段只足以说明你方为了挽救业已彻底破产的所谓‘自愿遣返’的荒谬主张已经堕落到如何卑劣的地步，任何曲解和诬蔑，都不能歪曲我方坚决反对所谓‘自愿遣返’和所谓‘甄别’的一贯立场。事实上只有你方却在这一会议上不断地进行着出尔反尔、自食其言的可耻行为。你方在第四项议程的秘密会议中一再声称：愿在我方三月二十一日提案的轮廓内解决问题，但你方却推翻了你方自己的明确表示，坚持你方扣留我方被俘人员的片面无理主张，拒绝在合理的基础上协商解决唯一阻碍着朝鲜停战的战俘问题。不管你方采取什么野蛮的办法，我方被俘人员反抗你方强迫甄别与强迫扣留，向全世界发出的正义呼声，是不容抹煞的。不管你方采取什么可耻的手段，你方战俘营长官公开向全世界承认你方罪恶非法行为的招供是不能收回的。你方所谓‘自愿遣返’的荒谬主张已彻底破产，无可挽救。为了会议的进展，你方必须撤消你方企图扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰的主张，接受我方使全体战俘得以回家过和平生活的五月二日的方案，做解决战俘问题的唯一合理基础。”
    “如我所曾经多次指出过的，任何你方对于我方被俘人员的所谓甄别都是以扣留我方被俘人员为目的，剥夺战俘遣返权利，违反日内瓦公约和一切国际战争法规的行为。我方已经一贯地加以驳斥和反对，并且还要继续驳斥，继续反对。任何你方所提的所谓重新甄别都是为了扣留我方人员，而任何扣留我方被俘人员的办法都是不能容许的。只有你方放弃你方的所谓甄别或重新甄别的幻想，停止剥夺战俘遣返的权利，战俘问题的解决才有可能。一切事实证明你方对我方被俘人员使用暴力强迫进行甄别，企图扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰。我方的被俘人员为了反对强迫甄别，为了拒绝充当你们的炮灰，曾冒着被集体屠杀的危险，正义地要求‘立即停止强迫甄别……重新武装或永久地不合法地被奴役’。即连你方前任战俘营长官也不得不公开保证不再‘进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动’。这难道不是你们进行了强迫甄别的明证吗？我方被俘人员正义地要求你方‘立即终止野蛮行为、侮辱、酷刑、拷问、强迫写血书、威胁、禁闭、集体屠杀’等等彻底违反日内瓦公约，违反人类行为最低标准的罪恶行为。你方前任战俘营长官更明确声明‘我承认曾有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或击伤，我保证将来将有合乎人道的待遇。我本人将对将来的任何暴行负责’。这难道不是证明你方为了甄别，不能不凭借暴行欠下了无数的血债吗？这些铁一般的事实已被永远记载为人类历史上最丑恶的一页，决不是你们所能抹杀的。你方不敢面对这种无从否认的事实，你方不能回答我所提出的质问，但你方却悍然声称你方在帐篷以外已有所答复。什么是你方在帐篷外的答复？在当时你方战俘营长官提出保证后的数日之内，你方司令官就公然撕毁这种对战俘待遇的起码条件的保证，明白表示你方将继续使用暴力，继续强迫进行甄别，继续强迫进行重新武装，继续企图扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰。你方现任战俘营长官更将你方对于我方被俘人员的非人道待遇称之为‘过于宽大’，叫嚣‘要使战俘认识到我们是强硬的’。你方调派大量兵力、大批坦克到你方战俘营的所在地进一步镇压我方被俘人员的正义抗争。这就是你方在这一帐篷外的答复，但你方必须对你方在这一帐篷外对我方被俘人员的每一行动负完全的绝对的责任。你方在这一帐篷之内的每一欺骗的论点和谎言已为这一帐幕之外的全世界人民所共晓的事实所彻底粉碎。你们还有什么资格在这里提出‘基本人权’和‘个人尊严’？你们还有什么资格在这里继续提出所谓‘自愿遣返’的原则？你们还有什么资格在这里继续提出所谓‘甄别’？你们更有什么资格在这里提出所谓‘共同公开重行甄别’？为了会议的进展，你方必须彻底放弃你方企图扣留我方被俘人员的片面无理主张。”
