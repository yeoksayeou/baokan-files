    Proletarian Internationalism and the Struggle of the Korean People
    Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Korean Workers' Party

    I

    May Day—this spring festival, a festival of brotherly friendship among the people of all countries—is here. The continuous growth and strengthening of the international solidarity of the working people is one of the greatest victories of the communist movement and a concrete manifestation of the victory of the Lenin-Stalin doctrine of proletarian internationalism. Under the banner of proletarian internationalism, millions of people are uniting more closely to defend their social and national interests, shaking the tottering pillars of capitalism.

    Proletarian internationalism is a powerful weapon for freedom-loving people to fight for peace and against imperialist aggression. At present, when Anglo-American imperialism is frantically preparing for a new world massacre, and only the united efforts of the people of the world can stop this new world massacre, the Lenin-Stalin doctrine of proletarian internationalism plays a particularly important combat role.

    The Lenin-Stalin doctrine of proletarian internationalism is of extremely great significance to the national liberation struggle of the Korean people. This doctrine illuminates the path of our struggle and ensures the assistance and support of the people of all countries.

    Under the leadership and education of the Workers' Party, the Korean people have deeply realized from their own experience that only on the basis of internationalism can the interests of the motherland and the nation be defended; true patriotism is closely inseparable from proletarian internationalism and is incompatible with bourgeois nationalism.

    The attempts of the bourgeois nationalists in Korea to limit the Korean independence movement to the scope of bourgeois society are shameful and futile. Fearing the development of the revolutionary movement of the masses, bourgeois nationalists tried their best to prevent the Korean people from actively launching a struggle against the Japanese aggressors; they sought assistance from the ruling groups of the United States, old China, and other bourgeois countries, and inevitably became pawns of new imperialist ambitious men who attempted to rule Korea; the only way to avoid becoming pawns was to abandon political struggle and admit their complete failure.

    Imperialist plunderers, whether Japanese or American imperialists, regard Korea as an object of plunder, and they insist that the Korean people are born colonial slaves. They cunningly use Korean bourgeois nationalists to achieve their goal of turning Korea into a colony, and use all means to massacre those who see through their conspiracies and have the conscience and courage to refuse to serve the colonizers.

    For example, we still remember the killings of Li Yunheng and Jin Jiu in South Korea; they were killed simply because they changed their attitude towards American policy, and they saw that American policy was a threat to re-enslave Korea.

    Naturally, the bourgeois nationalists' attempts to achieve Korea's independence with the help of foreign imperialists are nothing but illusions. The bourgeois nationalists' activities in preventing the people from fighting for national liberation and assisting the conspiracies of the American imperialists are of course reactionary and betray the motherland.

    Only by taking the path of proletarian internationalism can the Korean people accomplish their historical mission, achieve the final liberation of their country, and build Korea into an independent and democratic country. The facts of the past few years have deeply convinced our people of this.

    Korea's ability to achieve independent survival and to build the country victoriously is largely due to the help of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union, for which we are deeply grateful. The Soviet Union liberated us from the long shackles of Japanese aggressors.

    The Soviet people, loyal to proletarian internationalism, have continued to give us great help after our liberation. Without this assistance from the Soviet Union, it would have been impossible for our country to carry out major political and economic reforms, thereby consolidating our people's democratic system; it is precisely because of the Soviet Union's assistance that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has become extraordinarily consolidated and strong, making it impossible for the American aggressors to defeat it.

    Because of the Soviet Union's international support for the rights and interests of the Korean people, the American imperialists, despite their political conspiracies in the United Nations, cannot achieve their goal of interfering in Korea. Even the armed intervention of the American imperialists has been in vain.

    During the years of war and suffering, our people have felt for the first time the great significance of the unity of freedom-loving people on the basis of proletarian internationalism. The Korean people, suffering from the aggression of American imperialism, are deeply sympathized with and cared for by all progressive mankind. The honest people of all countries in the world are increasingly firmly demanding to stop the American executioners who are invading Korea.

    In the countries of the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, a large-scale movement to aid the Korean people is currently underway. When our country was at a critical juncture, the Chinese People's Volunteers—representatives of our neighbor, friend, and great Chinese people—stepped forward to help Korea. The American imperialists' wishful thinking of isolating and destroying the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with the help of their United Nations organization has been utterly defeated.

    Our friends all over the world answered the conspiracies of the American imperialists with the fraternal unity of freedom-loving people, and gave us immeasurable great assistance; thanks to their assistance, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has consolidated its position at home and abroad.

    The international prestige of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been greatly enhanced in the war. Because the course of events has made our people the active fighters at the forefront of the struggle for peace and against the warmongers of imperialism, and has demonstrated unprecedented courage and fortitude.

    The moral, political, and material assistance given to us by fraternal people is a major factor in our victory in the struggle against the American aggressors. We must especially emphasize the educational significance of this factor.

    If we consider the fact that throughout the period of Japanese rule, the Korean people were deprived of the right to contact the people of other countries, and that for a long time the Japanese rulers instilled in them narrow national consciousness and anti-Soviet sentiments, then the revolutionary impact on our people due to the development of the fraternal relations between our people and the people of the democratic camp, and the selfless assistance given to our people by the people of the democratic camp in our days of suffering, becomes very obvious. The Korean people realize that they are not isolated in the struggle against the colonialists; this encourages them and strengthens their confidence in victory.

    The ideas of proletarian internationalism are deeply permeating the minds of the Korean people; the Korean people have heartfelt sympathy and gratitude for the fraternal people of all countries.

    We are loyal to the Lenin-Stalin doctrine, loyal to the unity of the people of the democratic camp—the brilliant embodiment of the Lenin-Stalin doctrine. The Korean Workers' Party is educating the Korean people in this spirit, and regards this work as its important task.

    II

    Under the influence of the Lenin-Stalin doctrine of proletarian internationalism, a completely new type of international relations unprecedented in history—the prototype of future communist international relations—has been formed. These are the relations between the countries of the democratic camp based on mutual respect and fraternal cooperation. This new type of relationship, compared with the international relations in the capitalist world, especially shows its greatness; the principles of international relations in the capitalist world are completely different. International relations in the capitalist world are a relationship of cruel struggle, a relationship of mutual competition for markets, competition for raw materials, the law of the jungle, and mutual plunder of colonies and semi-colonies. Korea was once one of the victims of this relationship; however, we are pleased that with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, Korea has been liberated from the shackles of capitalist countries and has forever become a member of the invincible camp of peace and friendship.

    Speaking of the fraternal assistance of the people of all countries in the democratic camp, one cannot help but recall the so-called "assistance" to Korea initiated by the United Nations. This is out of the shameless proposal of the American imperialists, who, after brutally ravaging our country and immersing our entire country in blood, actually want to pretend to be the benefactors of Korea, which is a great insult to us. As everyone knows, the American imperialists single-handedly created a resolution in the United Nations on "assisting" the reconstruction work of Korea. But what is the value of these criminals who are still using barbaric means to kill the Korean people and destroy their homes, while repeatedly talking about assisting Korea? This kind of hypocrisy of the imperialist bandits is extremely vicious!

    In South Korea, the Americans have set up a United Nations Korean Commission, saying that it is to help revitalize Korea, but in essence, it is only to help the invaders destroy Korea and to cover up their evil deeds. When the Korean people were groaning under the terrible conditions of terror, hunger and death in the rule of the American occupation army and its running dog Li Chengwan, this committee was indifferent and complacent.

    There has never been any capitalist country in the world willing to take out a little bit of its resources to help the civilians who have suffered from the ravages of war. Of course, we fully understand the value of the "assistance" praised by the imperialist camp. But there is another kind of assistance, this is the sincere and comprehensive assistance that we often get from the countries of the democratic camp, and we know the value of this assistance.

    Here are some remarkable examples that the Korean people will always remember. On the eve of the spring plowing in 1951 (the first spring plowing in wartime), we were extremely short of farming livestock, because some of our original livestock had been killed, and some had been driven to South Korea during the American occupation of North Korea. This situation made it impossible for us to cultivate the land. At this time, the fraternal people of Mongolia came to help us; they gave the Korean people 7,000 heads of livestock as a gift. In addition, in order to meet the needs of the Korean people who suffered from war disasters, the Mongolian People's Republic also sent us a large amount of meat, leather and other valuable items.

    The People's Republic of China, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, and Albania have all given us a large amount of assistance in food, clothing, shoes, socks, and medicine, and continue to assist us. For example, the Romanian People's Republic has been helping our people since the United States began its aggression against Korea, and this April, it sent another 188 train cars of valuable gifts to the Korean people.

    The people of Romania have announced that they are willing to adopt 1,500 Korean orphans, whose parents were sacrificed in the American aggression. Is there anything more noble than the assistance given by these truly fraternal people in the world?

    Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries have adopted Korean orphans. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia have also sent many medical experts to Korea.

    We are always grateful for the meticulous care and support of these friendly people.

    Summer is the season when North Korea is most in need of food, and the war has deepened this difficulty. However, at this critical juncture, when the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was racking its brains to solve the problem of food shortage, Comrade Stalin, who foresaw our plight, gave us 50,000 tons of flour as a gift from the Soviet people. We are infinitely pleased and grateful for the wise measures of this great leader and mentor; we accepted this gift with such infinite joy and gratitude; our people believe that this is another selfless, fraternal assistance from the Soviet people to the Korean people who are bravely fighting for the freedom and independence of their country.

    The assistance given to Korea by the great and heroic Chinese People's Volunteers is a prominent manifestation of the fraternal concern of the people of all countries in the democratic camp for the Korean people. Korea and China have always been interdependent historically. In the common struggle and common goal against foreign oppressors and their running dogs, our Korean and Chinese people have united on the basis of unbreakable friendship.

    When the Korean patriots were persecuted by the Japanese aggressors and had to find a place to settle down, the Chinese people carefully and thoughtfully prepared safe havens for them. In the years of resisting the Japanese aggressors (when the strength of the enemy and ourselves was very different), the Korean guerrillas fought in the border areas of Korea and Manchuria, and received fraternal support from the Chinese people. Similarly, thousands of Korean patriots later joined the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and fought together, actively helping the Chinese people overthrow the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang.

    Now, the American aggressors, after being driven out of China, have made a comeback and want to invade China from Korea. This is a critical moment for our Korean people. However, good neighbors help each other in times of trouble and are willing to go through fire and water. The Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely came to our aid. Thanks to the joint efforts of the Korean and Chinese people, we have successfully undertaken the task of defeating the arrogant aggressors.

    As pointed out earlier, the fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers supported the Korean War is a new and brilliant manifestation of the unwavering friendship and mutual assistance between the countries of the democratic camp. This is a noble assistance from a strong country to a weak country on the basis of selfless, equal and mutual respect. Despite all the conspiracies of the imperialists, this mutual help ensures that the countries of the democratic camp are indestructible.

    III

    The aggression of American imperialism has brought untold suffering to our people. Lenin once said that the big American tycoons, these modern slave owners, have begun a particularly tragic page in the bloody history of bloody imperialism.

    Lenin, this genius of mankind, once pointed out that American imperialism is the most ferocious imperialism, the most tyrannical imperialism that oppresses and devastates small and weak nations. Our people have deeply realized this correct and profound description through the painful experience of this war.

    The American imperialists want to turn Korea into an American colony and suppress our people's struggle for freedom and independence, so they launched a war with unprecedented destructive power on our land. They gathered the huge military force of the United States and eighteen vassal countries to invade this small country of Korea.

    After these invaders encountered the strong and unyielding resistance of our heroic people, they violated international law and all principles of human morality, and used the most barbaric war means, such as poison gas, bacteriological weapons, gasoline bombs, and the mass murder of peaceful residents—patriots.

    In this respect, the American colonists have accumulated a lot of experience. As everyone knows, as early as in their war against the Indians, the ancestors of Truman's savages skinned the captured Indians, and they offered a reward—one hundred and fifty dollars for a man's scalp, and fifty dollars for a woman's scalp. Truman's bandits are widely promoting this robber tradition in their invading Korean army. They spent a lot of money to eliminate the peaceful Korean people, destroy their families and artistic treasures, humiliate women, and carry out other crimes.

    Engels once described the British army as the most barbaric army. In World War II, the atrocities of the German fascist army surpassed the British army. At that time, people could not imagine that there could be anything more terrible and ugly than the crimes of the Hitler murderers. However, the crimes of the Americans in Korea exceeded the Hitler gang, and all fair foreign observers who visited our country, such as journalists, people's delegations, special investigation teams of the International Democratic Women's Federation and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, unanimously confirmed this in their statements.

    The destruction and losses caused by the invaders who were repeatedly frustrated and became like mad dogs in our country are indeed huge. However, despite all the destruction and losses in our country, despite the enemy's great technological superiority, despite the enemy's use of a large number of criminal means of eliminating the people, despite the enemy's various atrocities and the use of all kinds of tricks, our people have still persisted, fended off the enemy's attacks, and frustrated the enemy's plundering plans. Therefore, we can say without any doubt that in this regard, the decisive factors are the indestructible stability of the people's democratic regime, the unity and selflessness shown by the Korean people in defending their freedom and independence under the leadership of the Workers' Party armed with advanced revolutionary theory, and the solidarity and active support of the people of all countries in the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    Lenin once pointed out that war is a comprehensive test of the entire material and spiritual strength of a country's people. From this sentence, the tenacity and unity shown by the Korean people in the struggle against the American aggressors is particularly prominent. The war tested our people and made them more convinced that the path taken by the Workers' Party leading them is the only correct path to freedom and prosperity. This explains why our people are now unprecedentedly united and determined to defend their just cause to the end.

    One of the most important characteristics of the current political situation in Korea is the continuous growth of the Workers' Party's prestige among the broad masses. The strategy and tactics of the Workers' Party are based on the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and on the rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the fraternal parties of the people's democratic countries. Therefore, in the struggle against the American aggressors, the Workers' Party can ensure the consolidation of the alliance of all democratic forces in the country. This alliance is specifically manifested in the "Democratic Patriotic United Front" composed of political parties and public organizations in North and South Korea, and the establishment and consolidation of the united front is the result of the great work of the Workers' Party.

    The Workers' Party is the main organizational and leading force of the people in the front and the rear. The reason why the people are united around the Workers' Party is because they see that the Party is the most loyal and resolute fighter to defend their vital interests, and the wise leader in the national struggle against the enslavement of the American imperialists.

    IV

    As mentioned above, the Korean people's struggle against the American aggressors has received international support, which has had a decisive impact on the development of the Korean situation. At the same time, we must emphasize that the Korean situation also has a major impact on current international relations.

    After investigating the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea, the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers reached a solemn conclusion that "the Korean matter cannot be regarded as an isolated and accidental event, but as a stage of development in the ongoing war, which may threaten the world and plunge the world into the abyss of war." The atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea and their use of criminal bacteriological weapons have aroused the indignation of honest people all over the world. From the example of Korea, people can see how dangerous the aggressive policy of the American ruling group will bring to mankind, and how terrible suffering the imperialist warmongers who launched a new world massacre are preparing for mankind. This group of warmongers even used bacteriological weapons without hesitation. Recognizing this, the people of all countries can unite and fight for peace more and more actively.

    At the same time, the disastrous failure of the American aggression plan in Korea has forced the warmongers to consider the possible consequences of military adventures. There is no doubt that in the plans of the American imperialists, invading Korea and China is an important move to launch a third world war. If the third world war has not become a reality, it is not because the American ruling group does not want to promote its realization, but because the rapid turn of events in Korea has frightened them, and the wise policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have prevented the continued expansion of the Korean conflict.

    We are proud that our people have heroically repelled the offensive of the American aggressors and have made an important contribution to preventing the outbreak of a third world war. Because of the firm and unwavering nature of our people, the United States has not been able to turn Korea into a military base to attack the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union; this matter will undoubtedly affect the overall situation of the imperialist camp.

    The Korean War discredited the United States militarily and politically, which is also an event of international significance. This largest imperialist country, leading its vassal countries, threw a large number of the most elite troops, equipped with powerful modern weapons, into battle to deal with us, but failed to conquer the small Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Today, the American imperialists have to admit that their army has been defeated, although they have tried their best to boast about the strength of their army. Former US Secretary of Defense Marshall concluded the Korean War, frankly saying that the myth has been debunked; others thought we were a strong country, but the fact proves that we are not.

    Because the myth of American invincibility has gone bankrupt due to the Korean War, this will undoubtedly help the people of all countries to no longer fear American military technology, and will strengthen their confidence in their own strength.

    The achievements of the Korean people are an inspiring example for the people of other countries in the East who are fighting for national independence and freedom. While the Korean people rose up to resist, the people of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaya, Egypt, Tunisia, and other countries are also increasingly determined to engage in struggle. This is by no means accidental. This is the prelude to the eventual failure of imperialism in the East.

    The military and political plans of American imperialism have suffered a disastrous defeat in Korea. This defeat proves that the imperialists can no longer satisfy their greed by seizing foreign territories as they did in the past; it also proves that today the people of all countries know the importance of freedom, and if they rely on the support of the camp of peace and democracy and resolutely fight for their national independence, it is impossible to enslave them again.

    The lessons of Korea tell us that if we form an organized peace front and fight back against the warmongers, we can bring them to justice. Because, without a doubt, the peace camp is stronger than the imperialist camp. Uniting the freedom-loving people of all countries and all peace supporters around the Soviet Union, and unswervingly implementing the policy of peace and the security of the people of all countries, this is an effective guarantee to prevent a third world war.

    Let the banner of proletarian internationalism, the ever-victorious banner of Lenin and Stalin, fly high all over the world! For the imperialists, let May Day be a day of great demonstrations of the unity of freedom-loving people of all countries; and for our inspiring struggle for peace and happiness, for our wise leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, let May Day be a day when the people of all countries express their infinite love for him!

    无产阶级国际主义与朝鲜人民的斗争
    朝鲜劳动党主席　金日成
    一
    “五一节”——这个春天的节日，各国人民兄弟般友爱的节日到来了。劳动人民的国际团结的不断增长与不断加强是共产主义运动的一个最伟大的胜利，是列宁—斯大林关于无产阶级国际主义的学说的胜利的具体表现。在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜之下，千百万的人民群众为着维护他们的社会利益与民族利益而更加密切地团结起来了，他们震撼了资本主义摇摇欲坠的支柱。
    无产阶级国际主义是爱好自由的人民为和平而斗争和反对帝国主义侵略的强有力的武器。在目前，当美英帝国主义正在疯狂地准备新的世界大屠杀，而只有全世界人民一致努力才能制止这新的世界屠杀的情况下，列宁—斯大林关于无产阶级国际主义的学说起着特别重大的战斗作用。
    列宁—斯大林的无产阶级国际主义学说，对于朝鲜人民的民族解放斗争有极其伟大的意义。这一学说照亮了我们的斗争的道路，并保证了各国人民给我们以援助和支持。
    在劳动党的领导和教育之下的朝鲜人民，根据他们本身的经验，已经深切地了解到：只有在国际主义的基础上，才能保卫祖国和民族的利益；真正的爱国主义是和无产阶级国际主义密切不可分的，而和资产阶级的民族主义则是水火不相容的。
    朝鲜的资产阶级民族主义者企图把朝鲜的独立运动限制在资产阶级社会范畴之内，他们的这些企图是可耻的和徒然的。资产阶级民族主义者害怕人民群众革命运动的发展，竭力阻止朝鲜人民积极展开反抗日本侵略者的斗争；他们向美国的统治集团、向旧中国和其他资产阶级国家寻求援助，而终于无可避免地变成了企图统治朝鲜的新的帝国主义野心家的走狗；要想不做走狗，唯一的道路，就只有放弃政治斗争，承认自己的完全失败。
    帝国主义掠夺者，不论是日本帝国主义或美国帝国主义，他们都把朝鲜当作掠夺的对象，他们硬说朝鲜人民是天生的殖民地奴隶。他们狡猾地利用朝鲜资产阶级民族主义者来实现他们把朝鲜变成为殖民地的目的，而用尽一切手段，把那些看穿了他们的阴谋诡计、并有良心和勇气拒绝为殖民者服务的人们加以屠杀。
    例如，我们还记得李运亨和金九在南朝鲜被杀害的情形；他们之所以被杀害，只不过因为他们改变了他们对待美国政策的态度，他们看出了美国的政策是把朝鲜再次沦为被奴役的地位的一个威胁。
    自然，资产阶级民族主义者企图借助外国帝国主义者的援助来取得朝鲜的独立，这些打算不外是一种幻想罢了。资产阶级民族主义者阻止人民争取民族解放的革命斗争，并援助美国帝国主义者的种种阴谋诡计，他们的这些活动当然也是反动的和出卖祖国的活动。
    只有采取无产阶级国际主义的道路，朝鲜人民才能完成它的历史任务，才能使他们的国家获得最后解放并把朝鲜建设成为独立的民主的国家。过去数年来的事实使我国人民深深的相信了这一点。
    朝鲜能够获得独立生存，能够胜利地建设国家，在很大的程度上，得力于兄弟国家的帮助，首先是苏联的帮助，这是我们得深深感谢的。苏联把我们从日本侵略者长期奴役的枷锁下解放了出来。
    苏联人民忠实于无产阶级国际主义，他们在我国获得解放以后，仍旧给了我们巨大的帮助，没有苏联的这些援助，我国就不可能进行重大的政治与经济改革，从而巩固我国的人民民主制度；正是由于苏联的援助，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国才变得异常的巩固和强大，使得美国侵略者无法战胜它。
    由于苏联对朝鲜人民的权利和利益在国际上给予支持，就使得美国帝国主义者虽然在联合国组织中玩弄政治阴谋的手段，但也不能达到它染指朝鲜的目的。就是美国帝国主义者的武装干涉也是一无所获。
    我国人民在战争的苦难岁月里，初次感觉到了爱好自由的人民在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上团结起来的伟大意义，遭受着美国帝国主义侵略的朝鲜人民，正深深为全体进步人类所同情和关切。全世界各国的正直人民正在愈来愈坚决地要求制止侵略朝鲜的美国刽子手。
    在以苏联为首的民主阵营的各国中，目前正在展开援助朝鲜人民的大规模的运动。当我国正处于严重关头的时候，中国人民志愿军——我们的邻邦、朋友、伟大的中国人民的代表——挺身而出，援助朝鲜。美国帝国主义者，企图借助于他们的联合国机构来孤立与毁灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的如意算盘，遭到了彻头彻尾的惨败。
    我们的遍及全世界的朋友们，以爱好自由人民的兄弟般的团结来回答美国帝国主义者的阴谋诡计，并给予我们以无可估量的伟大的援助；由于他们的援助，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国巩固了它在国内外的地位。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在国际上的威信，已经在战争中大大地提高了。因为事变的进程使我国人民成为争取和平、反对帝国主义战争贩子的最前列的积极战士，并且表现了空前的勇敢与刚毅。
    兄弟般的各国人民给予我们的道义的、政治的和物质的援助，是我们在反对美国侵略者的斗争中取得胜利的重大因素。我们必须特别强调这一因素的教育意义。
    如果我们考虑到这样一个事实，即：在日本统治的整个时期中，朝鲜人民群众被剥夺了与其他国家人民联系的权利，并且在一个长时期内日本统治者向他们灌输了狭隘的民族意识和反苏情绪，那末，目前由于我国人民与民主阵营各国人民的兄弟般的联系的发展，以及民主阵营各国人民在我国苦难深重的日子里给予我国人民以忘我的援助，对于我国人民所起的革命的影响就变得非常明显了。朝鲜人民认识到他们在反对殖民者的斗争中并不是孤立无援的；这就鼓舞了他们，加强了他们获得胜利的信心。
    无产阶级国际主义的思想正深深地渗入到朝鲜人民的思想意识里去；朝鲜人民对于兄弟般的各国人民怀着衷心的同情和感谢。
    我们忠实于列宁—斯大林的学说，忠实于民主阵营各国人民的团结——列宁—斯大林学说的光辉体现。朝鲜劳动党就是以这种精神来教育朝鲜的人民群众，并把这一工作作为自己的重大任务。
    二
    在列宁—斯大林关于无产阶级国际主义学说的影响之下，一种历史上前所未有的完全新型的国际关系——未来的共产主义者的国际关系的雏型，形成起来了。这是以互相尊重和兄弟般的合作为基础的民主阵营国家间的关系。这种新型的关系，与资本主义世界中的国际关系相比较，就特别显示出它的伟大；资本主义世界中国际关系的原则是完全不同的。资本主义世界中的国际关系是一种残酷斗争的关系，是互相争夺市场、争夺原料、弱肉强食、互相抢掠殖民地和半殖民地的关系。朝鲜便曾经是这种关系中的牺牲品之一；然而，我们感到欣慰的是：靠着伟大的苏联的援助，朝鲜已经从资本主义国家的桎梏中解放出来，而且永远成为不可战胜的和平与友好阵营中的一员了。
    说到民主阵营中各国人民兄弟般的援助，便不能不令人想起联合国所发起的所谓“援助”朝鲜的方式。这是出于美国帝国主义者无耻的建议，它在把我们的国家残酷蹂躏、把我们整个国家浸入血泊中之后，竟还要装成朝鲜的恩人的模样，这对我们真是一种莫大的侮辱。如大家所知道的，美国帝国主义者曾在联合国一手制造了关于“援助”朝鲜复员工作的决议案。但是，对于这些还在继续用野蛮手段杀害朝鲜人民，毁坏朝鲜人民的家园的罪犯们，他们口口声声说什么援助朝鲜，那还有什么价值可言呢？帝国主义强盗们这一种口蜜腹剑的行为是再恶毒不过的了！
    在南朝鲜，美国人设置了一个联合国朝鲜委员会，说是为了帮助复兴朝鲜，而实质上，只是为了帮助侵略者毁灭朝鲜，并借以掩饰他们的罪恶行径罢了。当朝鲜人民在美国占领军及其走狗李承晚的统治下，辗转呻吟于恐怖、饥饿和家破人亡的悲惨境况的时候，这个委员会是熟视无睹而且洋洋得意的。
    世界上也从没有过任何一个资本主义国家肯从它的资源中拿出一点点东西来周济惨遭战争浩劫的平民的，当然，为帝国主义阵营所颂扬的“援助”，其价值如何，我们是充分了解的。但是另外有一种援助，这是我们经常从民主阵营国家所获得的真心真意的、全面的援助，我们是知道这种援助的价值的。
    这里有一些令我们朝鲜人民永远铭感的显著事例。在一九五一年春耕的前夕（这是战时的第一次春耕），我们极端缺乏耕作的牲口，因为我们原有的牲口一部分已被杀害，一部分则在美军占领北朝鲜的期间，被赶到南朝鲜去了。这一情况使我们无法耕作。这时候，蒙古的兄弟人民便帮助我们来了；他们以七千头耕作的牲口作为礼物，赠给了朝鲜人民。另外，为了适应遭受战争灾害的朝鲜人民的需要，蒙古人民共和国还送了我们大量的肉类、皮革和其他珍贵的物品。
    中华人民共和国、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚，都曾经在粮食、衣服、鞋袜和医药方面给予我们以大量的援助，并且还在继续援助我们。例如罗马尼亚人民共和国，从美国开始侵略朝鲜的时候起，便一直在帮助着我们的老百姓，今年四月，又送给了朝鲜人民一百八十八个车箱的珍贵礼品。
    罗马尼亚的人民曾宣布，愿意收养朝鲜的一千五百名孤儿，这些孤儿的父母，都是在美国的侵略中被牺牲了的。世界上还有比这种真正兄弟人民所给予的援助更高贵的吗？
    匈牙利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚以及其他国家的人民，都收养了朝鲜的孤儿。苏联、中华人民共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克还派遣了许多医学专家到朝鲜。
    对于这些友好人民无微不至的关怀和支援，我们是时刻铭感的。
    夏季是北朝鲜粮食最感缺乏的季节，而战争更加深了这一方面的困难。但是，就在这一紧急关头，当朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府正在苦思焦虑争取解决这一粮食缺乏问题的时候，预见到我们困境的斯大林同志，赠送了我们五万吨面粉，作为苏联人民的礼物。我们对于这位伟大的领袖和导师的英明措施，是感到无限欣慰和感激的；我们以这种无限欣慰和感激的心情接受了这个礼物；我们的人民认为，这是苏联人民对于正在英勇地为他们国家的自由和独立而战斗的朝鲜人民又一次无私的、兄弟般的援助。
    伟大的、英勇的中国人民志愿军给予朝鲜的援助，是民主阵营各个人民，对于朝鲜人民兄弟般的关切的突出的表现。朝鲜和中国在历史上向来就是唇齿相依的。在反对外国压迫者及其走狗这个共同的斗争中和一致的目标下，我们朝、中人民已经在牢不可破的友谊基础上团结起来了。
    当朝鲜的爱国志士受到日本侵略者的迫害而必须寻找安身之所的时候，中国人民为他们妥善周到地准备了安全的避难所。在反抗日本侵略者的岁月里
    （当时敌我的实力是悬殊的）朝鲜的游击队在朝鲜和满洲边境地区作战，获得了中国人民兄弟般的支援，同样，成千的朝鲜爱国志士后来便加入到中国人民解放军的队伍，一同战斗，积极地帮助中国人民，推翻了国民党反动统治。
    而现在，美国侵略者在被赶出中国之后，又卷土重来，要从朝鲜侵入中国。这是我们朝鲜人民的生死关头。但是，好邻居是危难相济不惜赴汤蹈火的，中国人民志愿军毅然来支援我们了。由于朝、中人民的共同努力，我们已经胜利地把击溃骄横的侵略者的任务担当起来。
    正如前面已经指出的，中国人民志愿军支援朝鲜战争这一事实，是民主阵营国家间坚贞不渝的友谊和互助的一种新的和辉煌的表现，这是在无私的、平等和互相尊敬的基础上，强国给予弱国的一种崇高的援助。尽管帝国主义者使尽一切阴谋诡计，但这种相互间的帮助，就保证了民主阵营各国是不可摧毁的。

    美国帝国主义的侵略给我国人民带来了说不尽的苦难。列宁曾说过，美国的大富豪们，这些现代的奴隶主们，已经在血腥的帝国主义的血腥历史上开始了特别悲惨的一页。
    列宁这位人类的天才，曾经指出美国帝国主义是最凶暴的帝国主义，是压迫和摧残弱小民族的最蛮横的帝国主义，他的这种正确而深刻的描写，由于这次战争的惨痛经验，我国人民已深深地体会到了。
    美国帝国主义者要把朝鲜变成美国的殖民地并镇压我国人民争取自由和独立的斗争，因此在我们的土地上发动了具有空前毁灭力量的战争。他们纠集了美国和十八个仆从国家的庞大军力来进犯朝鲜这个小国。
    这些侵略者遭遇到我国英勇人民的坚强不屈的抵抗之后，竟然破坏国际公法和一切人类道德的原则，使用了最野蛮的战争手段，如毒气、细菌武器、汽油弹以及对和平居民——爱国者的大批屠杀。
    在这种兽行方面，美国殖民者是积累了很多的经验的。大家知道，早在他们对印第安人作战的那些日子，杜鲁门生番的祖先就曾经剥下被俘虏的印第安人的头皮，他们悬了赏格——一张男人的头皮付一百五十美元，一张女人的头皮付五十美元。杜鲁门匪徒们正在他们的侵朝军队中广泛地发扬这种强盗传统。他们花费了大量的金钱来消灭和平的朝鲜人民，摧毁他们的家庭和艺术宝藏，凌辱妇女，并进行其他的罪行。
    恩格斯当年曾把英国的军队描写为最野蛮的军队。在第二次世界大战中，德国法西斯军队的暴行超过了英国军队。当时人们不能想像还有比希特勒凶手们的罪行更可怕更丑恶的了。可是，美国佬在朝鲜的罪行却超过了希特勒匪帮，所有来我国访问的公正的外国观察者如新闻记者、人民代表团、国际民主妇女联合会和国际民主法律工作者协会的特别调查团，他们所发表的言论，都一致证实了这一点。
    屡遭挫折、成为疯狗似的侵略者，在我国所造成的破坏和损失确实是巨大的。然而，尽管我国遭受这一切破坏、一切损失，尽管敌人在技术上占有莫大的优势，尽管敌人使用大批消灭人民的罪恶手段，尽管敌人犯下种种暴行和使用一切诡计，我国人民仍然坚持下去，挡开了敌人的打击，挫败了敌人的掠夺计划，因此，我们可以毫无疑问地说，在这方面，决定的因素是人民民主政权的不可摧毁的稳定性，是朝鲜人民在以先进革命理论武装起来的劳动党领导下捍卫自己的自由和独立所表现出来的团结和忘我精神，是以苏联为首的民主阵营各国人民的声援和积极支持。
    列宁曾经指出，战争是一国人民整个物质力量和精神力量的全面考验。从这句话来看，朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略者的斗争中所表现的顽强和团结就特别来得突出。战争考验了我国人民，使他们更加相信：劳动党领导着他们所走的道路是走向自由和富强的唯一正确道路。这说明了为什么我国人民现在已经空前地团结起来，并决心把他们的正义事业保卫到底。
    朝鲜当前政治形势的最重要的特点之一，就是劳动党在广大群众中威信的不断增长。劳动党的战略和策略是根据马克思—列宁主义的学说的，是根据苏联共产党和人民民主国家兄弟党的丰富经验的，因此劳动党在反对美国侵略者的斗争中，能够确保全国一切民主势力联盟的巩固。这个联盟具体表现在南北朝鲜各政党、各公共团体所组成的“民主爱国统一战线”，而统一战线的成立和巩固，乃是劳动党进行了伟大的工作的结果。
    劳动党在前线和后方都是人民的主要组织力量和领导力量。人民所以团结在劳动党的周围，是因为他们看到党是保卫他们的切身利益的最忠实最坚决的战士，是反对美国帝国主义者奴役朝鲜的全民斗争中的英明领袖。
    四
    如上所述，朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者的斗争是得到国际支援的，这种支援对于朝鲜局势的发展起了决定性的影响。同时，我们必须着重指出，朝鲜的局势对于当前的国际关系也起着重大的影响。
    国际民主法律工作者协会调查团在朝鲜调查了美国侵略者的暴行之后，下了严正的结论，调查团认为“朝鲜的事情不能看作是孤立的偶然事件，而是正在进行中的战争的一个发展阶段，这个战争可能威胁全世界，使全世界陷入战争的深渊”。美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行和他们使用罪恶的细菌武器的行为激起了全世界正直人民的愤慨。从朝鲜这个例子中，人们就可以看出，美国统治集团的侵略政策会给人类带来多大的危险，发动新的世界大屠杀的帝国主义战争贩子们正替人类准备下多么可怕的苦难，这帮战争贩子们甚至毫不踌躇地使用了细菌武器。认识了这一点，各国人民就能团结起来，越来越积极地为和平而斗争。
    同时，美国侵略计划在朝鲜的惨遭失败使得战争贩子们不得不考虑到军事冒险的可能后果。毫无疑问，在美国帝国主义者的计划中，侵略朝鲜和中国是发动第三次世界大战的重要一着。如果第三次世界大战没有成为事实，并不是因为美国统治集团不想促其实现，而是因为朝鲜局势的急转直下把它们吓慌了，以及苏联和中华人民共和国的英明政策制止了朝鲜冲突的继续扩大。
    我们引以自豪的就是我们的人民英勇地击退了美国侵略者的进攻，对于制止第三次世界大战的爆发，也作了重要的贡献。由于我们人民的坚强刚毅，美国没有能够把朝鲜变成一个军事基地，以进攻中华人民共和国和苏联；这件事情，毫无疑问地，会影响到帝国主义阵营的总形势。
    朝鲜战争使美国在军事上、政治上威信扫地，这也是一件具有国际意义的大事。这个最大的帝国主义国家率领着它的仆从国家把为数甚多的，最精锐的，配备着强有力的现代武器的部队投入战斗，来对付我们，但却打不下小小的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    今天，美国帝国主义者不得不承认他们的军队是失败了，虽然他们曾极力吹嘘过他们军队的力量。美国前任国防部长马歇尔给朝鲜战争下过结论，他坦白地说，神话是揭穿了；别人以为我们是一个强国，而事实证明，我们并不是。
    由于朝鲜战争，美国无敌的神话破了产，这毫无疑问会帮助各国人民，使他们不再恐惧美国的军事技术，会加强他们对于自己的力量的信心。
    朝鲜人民的成就，对于正在为争取民族独立与自由而斗争的东方其他各国人民，是一个令人鼓舞的范例。与朝鲜人民奋起抵抗的同时，越南、菲律宾、马来亚、埃及、突尼斯以及其他国家的人民也越来越坚决地从事斗争。这绝不是偶然的，这是帝国主义在东方终归要失败的先声。
    美国帝国主义的军事、政治计划在朝鲜遭受了惨败，这种惨败证明了，帝国主义者再不能像过去那样，用攫取外国领土的办法来满足自己的贪欲了；也证明了，今天各国人民都已知道自由的重要，假使他们依靠和平与民主阵营的支援，为自己的民族独立而坚决奋斗，再要奴役他们，是万万不能的了。
    朝鲜的教训告诉我们，如果我们结成有组织的和平阵线，予战争贩子们以反击，我们是可以使他们就范的。因为，毫无疑问，和平阵营比帝国主义阵营更为坚强。把爱好自由的各国人民与一切和平拥护者团结在苏联的周围，坚持不渝地执行和平与各国人民安全的政策，这就是制止第三次世界大战的有效保证。
    让无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，列宁和斯大林的常胜旗帜高高地飘扬在全世界吧！对于帝国主义者，让五一节成为热爱自由的各国人民团结的大示威的日子；而对于鼓舞我们为和平与幸福而斗争、对于我们的英明领袖和导师斯大林同志，让五一节成为各国人民对他表示无限热爱的日子吧！
