Cultural Briefs

    ▲ The People's Government of Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is helping lamas establish cultural schools to study ethnic culture. There are more than 5,000 lamas in Xilingol League. In June last year, the Xilingol League People's Government organized more than 30 lamas selected from various lama temples who had Mongolian literacy and volunteered to work in cultural education to form a short-term teacher training class for lama schools. Now, these trained lamas have graduated and returned to their respective temples to establish lama schools. The Mongolian textbooks, teaching aids, books, newspapers, and pictorials for the lama schools are all provided by the People's Government, and the government also regularly sends people to explain current affairs policies to the lamas.

    Lama schools are very popular. Currently, 35 lama schools have been established in Xilingol League, and more than half of the lamas have participated in the learning. There is a 73-year-old lama in Donglian Banner named Renqing who also participated in the learning this time. The lamas are not only actively studying, but some are also participating in production. They are grateful to Chairman Mao for his concern for them. Many lama students frame Chairman Mao's portrait, decorate the surroundings with colorful silk knots, and hang it up.

    ▲内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟人民政府帮助喇嘛成立文化学校，学习民族文化。锡林郭勒盟有喇嘛五千多人。去年六月，锡盟人民政府组织了三十多个由各喇嘛庙选出的有蒙文修养自愿作文化教育工作的喇嘛，成立了一个短期的喇嘛学校师资训练班。现在，这些受训喇嘛已毕业返回各庙，建立喇嘛学校。喇嘛学校的蒙文教材、教具、书报、画刊等都由人民政府供给，政府还经常派人给喇嘛们讲解时事政策。
    喇嘛学校很受欢迎，现在锡林郭勒盟已成立了三十五所喇嘛学校，有二分之一以上的喇嘛参加了学习。东联旗有个七十三岁的喇嘛名叫任清，这次也参加了学习。喇嘛们不仅积极学习，有的还参加了生产。他们感激毛主席对他们的关心。很多喇嘛学员都把毛主席的像镶在镜框里，周围用彩绸作结挂起来。
