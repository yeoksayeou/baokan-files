    Deeply Develop the Full Load, Over-Axle, and Five-Hundred-Kilometer Movement
    – Speech at the Enlarged Meeting of the Tianjin Railway Administration Party Committee of the CPC
    Téng Dài Yuǎn

    The Tianjin Railway Administration Party Committee attaches great importance to the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, and everyone is full of confidence. This is a strong guarantee for carrying out this movement.

    Thanks to the efforts of the comrades, a good foundation has been laid for this movement. For example, the average daily mileage of freight locomotives in the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau reached 500 kilometers in April, and the entire Administration has reached more than 396 kilometers, with a net freight load of 29.4 tons.

    The method adopted by the conference of summarizing typical experiences to promote the general is very good. Various railway sub-bureaus should also learn from this method of the Tianjin Railway Administration Party Committee of the CPC.

    The meeting also demonstrated that the decision of the Ministry of Railways, etc., to launch the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement is timely, thus helping comrades solve problems. However, on the other hand, it can also be seen that due to our lack of experience, there are still some aspects of our ideological understanding that are not deep or complete enough. Unifying thoughts and understanding is a central topic of this meeting. Therefore, I would like to focus on ideological understanding first.

    The first question is why the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement is a new stage in the patriotic labor emulation campaign.

    To explain this issue, it is necessary to recall the history of our people's railways. Generally speaking, our people's railways have gone through two historical stages in the past three years: taking over, repairing, and opening to traffic after liberation, which is the first stage – the takeover stage. In this stage, everything was aimed at supporting the victory of the national liberation war. The objective tense situation did not allow for detailed democratic reforms. However, this historical stage was not long. After the basic liberation of the mainland, we successively entered another historical stage of democratic reform.

    In this stage, we universally adjusted personnel and institutions, implemented the responsibility system, and in particular, our country launched several great political movements (land reform, resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, making up for missed lessons in democracy, and the current great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, etc.), which played a very important role in democratic reform. Each movement has moved democratic reform forward. After more than three years of work, especially after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the democratic reform of the national railway system is nearing completion, and the national railway system is about to enter a new historical stage centered on production reform. The slogan put forward by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for the "May Day" Labor Day of thoroughly completing democratic reform and implementing production reform is entirely suitable for our railway situation, and is also entirely suitable for the specific situation of the Tianjin Railway Administration.

    After analyzing the historical situation of the national railway system, the question of the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement being a new stage in the patriotic labor emulation campaign becomes clearer and easier to understand. This movement is adapted to the stage of production reform, and it is the driving force for implementing production reform.

    This movement does not contradict the implementation of the economic accounting system, but is mutually integrated. The Tianjin Railway Administration has partially implemented the economic accounting system. Carrying out this competition movement is even more conducive to further implementing the economic accounting system. Because in the movement, workers will inevitably break old standards and create new quotas. This creates better conditions for continuing to implement and carry out the economic accounting system.

    The second question is about the ideological leadership of this movement.

    In Comrade Guo Hongtao's report, he specifically and differentially analyzed various erroneous thoughts, which is very necessary. Comrades from various railway sub-bureaus should also follow suit and conduct specific analyses. However, it should be reminded here that the development of this movement will be filled with ideological struggle from beginning to end. The basic manifestation of this ideological struggle is the struggle between the advanced ideas of the proletariat and the conservative ideas of the bourgeoisie. This thought is not only manifested outside the Party, but also reflected within the Party. The bourgeois ideas among technicians outside the Party often play a role through the erroneous ideas of some people within the Party. Those who have these wrong ideas should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and conduct criticism and self-criticism in order to achieve the goal of self-transformation. For those technicians who do not resist transformation and are willing to conduct self-study and self-transformation, we should try our best to organize them into the movement so that they can be tempered and improved in the mass movement; as for those deeply poisoned and stubborn conservatives, we should resolutely launch an ideological struggle against them, and if they do not change after repeated education, we should remove them from their leading positions.

    Comrade Guo Hongtao has already talked about how to carry out the movement in his report, and it is correct. Comrades have also made many good suggestions in their speeches. I would like to offer a few supplementary suggestions here for your reference:

    (1) The production movement should be combined with the "Three-Anti" movement. The construction phase of the "Three-Anti" movement, such as verification, determination, recovery of stolen goods, ideological education, system improvement, institutional adjustment, personnel allocation, etc., is still an arduous task and a very important work, and must be appropriately divided and done well. We must guide the enthusiasm of the workers in the "Three-Anti" movement to the production movement.

    (2) Under the leadership of the Party, we must formulate unified goals and mobilize the masses in depth. The leadership of the Party is the decisive key to carrying out this movement. Therefore, all departments must work under the unified leadership of the Party. The specific executors of this movement should focus on transportation, supplemented by locomotive affairs and other departments. In order to unleash and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, I suggest that you formulate a fighting plan at the next meeting. The work of mobilizing the masses should first be carried out through ideological education and propaganda mobilization. On this basis, we should formulate plans from bottom to top and launch mass-based challenge competitions.

    (3) In terms of business management, we should first strengthen the daily and shift plans. Daily and shift plans are important links in completing the production tasks of the day. Without a relatively thorough plan, the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement cannot be carried out well.

    In addition, a tight operation chart should be formulated based on the marshalling plan, technical operation process, and consideration of locomotive turnaround.

    Finally, I would also like to talk about one issue. To carry out the full load, over-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement, we must vigorously promote advanced working methods and implement joint labor. You have already paid attention to the issue of implementing advanced working methods, so I will not talk about it here. I will only focus on the issue of joint labor. The railway is a huge linkage machine, and without the close cooperation of various departments and without doing a good job in joint labor, this movement cannot be carried out. The basic content of joint labor is the organic combination of the initiative and creativity of the working class and the high degree of planning in business management. Therefore, the various departments of the railway must actively put forward their own demands and plans, actively assist the work of other departments, and resolutely fulfill their obligations. Carry out criticism and self-criticism, and expose shortcomings in work.

    The above is my opinion on this meeting. After this meeting, you will definitely create more new experiences, and I hope you will summarize them in a timely manner.

    深入开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动
    ——在中共天津铁路管理局党委扩大会议上的发言
    滕代远
    天津铁路管理局党委对于满载、超轴、五百公里运动很重视，大家也满有信心。这是开展这个运动的有力的保证。
    由于同志们的努力，为这个运动已打下了很好的基础。例如天津铁路分局四月份全月平均货物机车日车公里已能达到五百公里了，全管理局已达到三百九十六公里以上，货物净载重量已达到了二十九点四吨。
    大会采取总结典型经验来推动一般的方法是很好的。各个铁路分局也应学习中共天津铁路管理局党委的这一方法。
    会议也说明了铁道部等关于开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的这一决定是适合时机的，因之它也就帮助同志们解决了问题。但是另一方面也可以看到，由于我们经验不足，因之，在思想认识上也还有某些不够深刻、不够完备的地方。统一思想、统一认识是这次会议的一个中心议题。因之，我想首先着重讲一讲思想认识上的问题。
    第一个问题，为什么满载、超轴、五百公里运动是爱国主义劳动竞赛的新阶段呢？
    为了说明这个问题，有把我们人民铁路的历史加以回忆的必要。从总的方面说，三年来我们人民铁路经过了两个历史阶段：解放后的接管、抢修、通车，这是第一阶段——接管的阶段。这一阶段，一切以支援全国解放战争胜利为目的。客观的紧张的情况，不允许去细致地进行民主改革。但这一历史阶段，为时不长。全国大陆基本解放之后，我们就先后进入了民主改革的又一个历史阶段。
    在这个阶段内，我们普遍地调整了人事、机构，推行了负责制，特别是我们的国家开展了几个伟大的政治运动（土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、民主补课以及此次伟大的“三反”“五反”运动等），对民主改革起了很重要的作用。每一个运动，都把民主改革向前推进了一步。经过了三年多的工作，特别是经过了这次“三反”“五反”运动，全国铁路民主改革已经接近完成，全国铁路即将进入以生产改革为中心的新的历史阶段。中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会发布的“五一”劳动节口号提出的彻底完成民主改革，实行生产改革，是完全适合于我们铁路的情况的，同样也是完全适合于天津铁路管理局的具体情况的。
    我们分析了全国铁路的历史情况以后，对于满载、超轴、五百公里运动是爱国主义劳动竞赛的新阶段的问题，就更加明确和容易了解了。这个运动是和生产改革阶段相适应的，它是实行生产改革的动力。
    这个运动和推行经济核算制是没有矛盾的，是相互结合的。天津铁路管理局已经部分地实行了经济核算制。开展这个竞赛运动，对进一步贯彻经济核算制是更加有利的。因为在运动当中，职工必然不断地打破旧标准，创造新定额。这样，就给继续推行和贯彻经济核算制创造了更为良好的条件。
    第二个问题就是关于这个运动的思想领导的问题。
    在郭洪涛同志的报告中，具体地、有区别地分析了各种错误思想，这是很必要的。各铁路分局的同志们也应效法，进行具体的分析。不过在这里应该提醒一点：在这个运动的开展过程中，是会自始至终地充满着思想斗争的。这个思想斗争的基本的表现形式，就是无产阶级的先进的思想与资产阶级的保守思想的斗争，这个思想不但表现在党外，而且也会反映在党内，党外的技术人员当中资产阶级的思想，常常通过党内某些人的错误思想而起作用。有这些错误思想的人，应当遵照毛主席的指示，进行批评与自我批评，以便达到自我改造的目的。对于那些不抗拒改造的，愿意进行自我学习、自我改造的技术人员，我们应尽量把他们组织到运动中来，使他们在群众运动当中得到锻炼和提高；至于对那些中毒很深、顽固的保守主义分子，我们应当坚决展开思想斗争，如经过多次教育而不改的，应当撤消他们的领导职务。
    关于运动如何开展的问题，郭洪涛同志在报告中已经谈过，是正确的。同志们在发言当中也讲了许多很好的意见，我想这里只提出几点补充的意见，作为同志们的参考：
    （一）应把生产运动和“三反”运动结合起来。“三反”运动的建设阶段如核实、定案、追赃、思想教育、制度的改进、机构的调整、人事的调配等等，仍然是一个繁重的任务、一个很重要的工作，必须适当分工，把它做好。必须把“三反”运动中的工人的热情，引导到生产运动中去。
    （二）在党的领导下，要制订统一的奋斗目标，深入地发动群众。党的领导是开展这一运动的决定关键，所以，一切部门，都要在党的统一领导下进行工作。这一运动具体的执行人，应以运输为主，机务及其他为辅。为了发挥和组织群众的积极性和创造性，我建议你们在下一次会议上，最好要制订出一个奋斗计划。发动群众的工作，应当首先进行思想教育和宣传动员。在这一基础上，应自下而上地制订计划，开展群众性的挑战竞赛。
    （三）在业务管理上，首先应当加强日计划、班计划。日计划、班计划是完成当天生产任务的重要环节。没有比较周密的计划，满载、超轴、五百公里运动是不可能很好地开展的。
    另外应根据编组计划、技术作业过程、照顾机车交路，制订紧密运行图。
    最后，我还谈一个问题。开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，必须大力推广先进工作方法，实行联合劳动。关于实行先进工作方法的问题，你们已经予以重视，我在这里不谈。我只着重讲一下联合劳动的问题。铁路是一个庞大的联动机，没有各个部门的密切配合，不搞好联合劳动，这一运动是不可能开展的。联合劳动的基本内容：就是工人阶级的主动性、创造性和经营管理上的高度的计划性的有机的结合。因此，铁路的各个部门必须主动地提出自己的要求和计划，主动地帮助别的部门的工作，并坚决地履行自己的义务。开展批评与自我批评，揭露工作上的缺点。
    以上是我对这次会议的意见。这次会议以后，你们一定会创造出更多的新的经验来，希望你们及时总结。
