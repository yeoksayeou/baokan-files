    The Soviet Union, Saslavsky
    The American military has committed and continues to commit appalling atrocities in Korea. There have been reports of this before, but the American newspapers have resorted to denial or suppression. Now, the conclusive facts of the bloody suppression of Korean prisoners of war on Geoje Island have shocked the world. These facts cannot be blocked; they cannot be ignored. The American rulers cannot deny what American generals have confirmed in documents.

    People all over the world have expressed great indignation. The American ruling group is also very unhappy.

    Why are people so angry? Why are the American rulers so agitated?

    It is the crimes committed by the American military in the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, South Korea, that have aroused the anger of the people. These crimes are inhumane. Only bandits who completely disregard the standards and concepts of international law and who lack even the most basic sense of humanity would do such things. The criminals have already confessed. General Colson said: "I certainly admit that there have been incidents of bloodshed, and as a result, many prisoners of war have been killed or wounded by United Nations forces." General Colson promised that there would be no more abuse of prisoners of war in the future. He spoke as an American general, and he swore on his military honor to treat prisoners of war humanely in the future. General Colson's confession is enough to subject him and his partners to trial.

    Will this happen? Will these executioners who once served as commanders on Geoje Island really be brought to justice? The American rulers are enraged by their actions. The American bourgeois newspapers are also furious. However, the anger and fury are not because these executioner generals committed crimes, but because General Dodd and General Colson admitted these crimes; they should not have admitted anything, they should not have betrayed anyone. The masters of the Pentagon and the masters of the White House cannot forgive these generals because they made promises to treat prisoners leniently. Those who instructed the executioners to commit crimes wish they could take revenge immediately.

    Dodd and Colson violated the bandits' code; this is a crime against the government.

    The people demand a public trial of these criminal generals. The Pentagon also threatens them with a military trial. However, it can be asserted that in the United States, things will not go so far as to go to court. No matter how angry the American rulers are with these errant generals, they will always protect these criminals. However, what Dodd and Colson have said is enough to expose the bloody atrocities of the American aggressors. The American rulers must shut their mouths. Every additional word will expose all the accomplices.

    However, they have already been exposed, no matter what. The crimes of Dodd and Colson are just one example of the many acts of brutality committed under the guise of the United Nations flag. Colson's confession not only paints a gruesome picture of massacres, torture, abuse, and falsification on Geoje Island, but it also exposes the activities carried out by General Ridgway and General Clark's headquarters, the most secret residences in Washington, and the comfortable lounges of the White House.

    The executioners meticulously kept the secret of the prisoner-of-war camps—death camps—from outsiders. Hitler's bandits in the past were not as afraid of their crimes being exposed as the American military has been and is now. After the war, the world learned in great detail about many of the crimes of Hitler's bandits; they learned about these situations from the confessions and testimony of the defendants and witnesses during the Nuremberg trials. The American chairman of the International Military Tribunal and the American prosecutor were forced, along with lawyers from other countries, to thoroughly investigate and fully explain the terrible circumstances under which Hitler's bandits tried their best to torture, torment, and slowly slaughter prisoners of war: starvation, suspension, whipping, waterboarding, tattooing, inhumane and indecent experiments, burning alive... These atrocities were declared crimes against humanity, and not only the direct perpetrators, commanders, and other executioners were responsible, but also the masterminds. According to the verdict, these people were all hanged. The Americans also signed this verdict.

    Now, the bloody crimes committed by Hitler's fascist bandits are being re-enacted in American prisoner-of-war camps in Korea. Geoje Island has become a place in the memory of the people of all countries like Auschwitz and Majdanek: the same crimes and the same atrocities as in Hitler's bandits' prisoner-of-war camps and torture chambers are being carried out on Geoje Island, but on a larger scale, more despicable, and more shameless. We now know that on Geoje Island, people are also starved and subjected to unbearable physical and mental torture. Hitler's executioners enjoyed inciting hunting dogs to strangle prisoners of war. Their American brothers also incited the heinous Syngman Rhee bandits to mutilate defenseless people, brand "anti-communist" characters on their backs, extort confessions from them, demand that they express their "hope" to stay in South Korea to participate in the war against Korean patriots, and force them to sign these petitions with their own blood.

    Those who refuse to be traitors are killed by the hundreds in American torture chambers. The executioner commander is doing these things according to the statements of the American generals and officers who participated in the negotiating delegation. In the negotiations, these generals and officers hypocritically said that some Koreans were unwilling to be repatriated, but at the same time, the executioner commander was threatening to kill the prisoners of war to sign these petitions. Whoever refused was slaughtered and tortured.

    The United States and the Pentagon know this situation; they all know it, but they not only do not condemn this brutal system, but also demand that this system be implemented.

    For the American rulers, General Colson's confession, which confirmed the unspeakable atrocities on Geoje Island, is not news. Therefore, these dishonorable facts did not anger Washington. What angered them was that the conspiracy of silence was broken, and that two American generals violated the discipline of the conspirators. However, obviously the instigators of the executioners still hope that the anger of the people will be limited to demanding the trial of individual criminals and bandits, and they still hope that the current "unpleasantness" of the American rulers can be "localized."

    However, this calculation is wrong and too short-sighted.

    General Dodd and General Colson are the executors. Who are the masterminds?

    In fact, the leaders of American policy and strategy completely confirmed what Dodd and Colson said, they only rebuked Dodd and Colson for leaking secrets and telling the world the secrets of the torture camps. The fact that American generals and ministers instructed the new executioner General Boatner to continue the atrocities on Geoje Island proves that they are also responsible.

    Washington can never cover up the crimes of the aggressors in Korea, nor can they escape their responsibility for these crimes. Their evil deeds expose their lies. Their crimes against prisoners of war have aroused the anger of the people, not only because these crimes are barbaric and despicable, but also because they are hypocritical and disgusting. Americans are engaged in this criminal activity with a division of labor. Some of them are lying with flowery words, and others are slaughtering. While Americans are talking sweetly and full of love for humanity, captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are suffering torture, torture, and slaughter.

    Those Washingtonians who preach "human dignity" secretly order their trusted lackeys in Korea to use the most barbaric means and the most cruel punishments, intending to violate the Geneva Conventions and force prisoners of war to "voluntarily" refuse repatriation. Those "decent" people in Washington talk about their so-called "dignity," so that other "decent" people in Korea can severely abuse prisoners of war and forge documents, so that other "decent" people in the armistice negotiation delegation can stage a shameless farce, sabotage the armistice, and prolong the war indefinitely. What the Washington brand of American "decent" people want is not peace, but endless war—a most profitable business. On the New York Stock Exchange, even the failure to prolong the war is worth more than any kind of peace.

    The heinous crimes of the American aggressors on Geoje Island not only exposed these two American generals, but also exposed the entire set of American imperialism's methods of using flowery words to cooperate with bloody crimes. The responsibility for this crime cannot be escaped, and lying is useless. The American ruling group issued empty statements to brazenly deny their responsibility for launching the evil germ warfare, but this denial is in vain. Acheson swore to God that the American government was not guilty. But how much are the words and oaths of this "decent" politician worth? Even a penny is too expensive.

    We know that the hypocrites in high positions in the United States will come out more than once to deny the undeniable evidence of their bloody crimes. They will also shout loudly in various tones about their own "dignity" and "moral values." But we will know that another ugly crime against humanity is being prepared, or even has already been committed, and the American mockingbirds are singing to the blood of the victims.

    However, the people cannot be deceived, and the gentlemen in the Pentagon and Congress cannot deceive not only the people of other countries who have seen through what is hidden behind the mask of American imperialism, but also the American people themselves. Over time, American soldiers who voluntarily or involuntarily participated in this atrocity will gradually loosen their lips.

    American prisoners of war detained in North Korea only discovered the whole truth after they got rid of the atmosphere of lies and fabrications, and they are now providing evidence to expose the aggressors. American pilots are also providing evidence, exposing criminals, and announcing the organization of germ warfare to the world, confirming the conclusions made by the impartial people who investigated the germ bomb incidents. Now, American generals themselves are providing evidence of atrocities.

    As the saying goes: what is written in black and white cannot be erased by an ax. The criminals in Washington were caught on the spot with conclusive evidence, so they also wanted to take an ax and cut off the black characters written by General Colson on white paper. It has become a habit for these "decent" people to do things like wiping off the words they wrote themselves on international treaties, and you cannot expect them to do anything else.

    The people do not want war. This is why the American aggressors have suffered a disastrous defeat. The people are increasingly aware of the root of the aggression. They see that American imperialists have embarked on the path of the tyrannical, lawless, and bloody banditry of the Hitler gang.

    刽子手及其保护人
    苏联  萨斯拉夫斯基
    美国军方在朝鲜干下了而且还在继续干着骇人的暴行。以前就有过这样的消息，可是美国报章采取了抵赖或者是封锁的办法。现在，对巨济岛上朝鲜战俘进行血腥镇压的确凿事实，已经震惊了全世界。这些事实是封锁不住的；不加理睬也是不行的。美国统治者们无法抵赖美国将军们在文件里已经证实了的事情。
    全世界人民表示了极大的愤慨。美国统治集团也是满不高兴的。
    为什么人民这样愤怒呢？为什么美国统治者也那样激动呢？
    是美国军方在南朝鲜巨济岛战俘营里干下的罪行激起了人民的愤怒。这些罪行是没有人性的。只有那些完全无视国际法的标准和概念、连起码的人道观念都没有的匪徒们才会干这样的事。罪犯们已经供认不讳了。柯尔生将军说：“我肯定承认有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或打伤。”柯尔生将军保证以后不会再有虐待战俘的事发生。他是以一个美国将军的身份讲话的，他以军人的荣誉宣誓以后要给战俘以人道待遇。柯尔生将军的供状已经足以使他自己和伙伴们受到审判了。
    会不会这样呢？这些曾经担任巨济岛指挥官的刽子手们会不会真的受到审判呢？美国的统治者们被他们的所作所为激怒了。美国的资产阶级报纸也大发脾气。然而，激怒和发脾气倒不是因为这些刽子手将军们犯了罪，而是因为杜德将军和柯尔生将军承认了这些罪行；他们应该什么都不承认，他们不该出卖任何人。五角大楼的主人和白宫的主人是不能饶恕这些将军的，因为他们作了宽待俘虏的诺言。指使刽子手犯罪的人们恨不得马上来一个复仇。
    杜德和柯尔生违反了土匪的纪律；这是反对政府的罪行。
    人民要求当众公审这些犯罪的将军们。五角大楼也吓唬他们说要举行军事审判。然而，可以断言，在美国，事情是不会闹到上法院那种地步的。不管美国的统治者们对于他们这些犯了错误的将军们生多大的气，他们总是要对这些罪犯加以袒护的。可是，杜德和柯尔生所说的话已经足以揭发美国侵略者的血腥暴行了。美国的统治者们必须封住他们的嘴。每多说一个字，就会把全体同谋犯都暴露出来的。
    然而，不管怎样，他们已经被暴露出来了。杜德和柯尔生的罪行不过是在联合国旗帜掩护下的许许多多兽行的一个事例罢了。柯尔生的供状不仅刻划了巨济岛上的一幅屠杀、酷刑、虐待和造假的狰狞的图画，它还把李奇微将军和克拉克将军的总部、华盛顿的最秘密的宅邸、以及白宫的舒适的休息室里面所干的勾当统统暴露了出来。
    刽子手们周密地保守战俘营——死亡营的秘密，不让任何外人知道。希特勒匪徒过去并不像美国军方过去和现在这样害怕他们的罪行被揭发。在战后，全世界已经十分详细地知道了希特勒匪徒的许多犯罪事实；他们从被告和证人在纽伦堡审讯期间的供词和证词中了解到这些情况。国际军事法庭的美国籍主席和美国籍检察官，被迫和其他国家的律师一道详细查明和充分说明希特勒匪徒千方百计对战俘实行酷刑，折磨和慢性屠杀的可怕情景：饿饭、倒悬、鞭打、灌水、刺字、进行见不得人的惨无人道的实验、活活烧死……这些暴行被宣布为反人类的罪行，不仅直接的执行者、指挥官和其他刽子手要负责，主谋人也要负责。按照判决，这些人都被绞杀了。美国人也在这个判决上签了字。
    现在，希特勒法西斯匪徒所干的血腥罪行又在朝鲜美国战俘营中重演了。巨济岛在各国人民的记忆中已经成为和奥斯威辛与麦丹尼克一样的地方：和希特勒暴徒的俘虏营与刑讯室中一样的罪行、一样的暴行正在巨济岛进行着，只不过规模更大、也更加可恶和更加无耻罢了。我们现在知道，在巨济岛上，人们也被饿饭、也遭到不堪忍受的肉体上和精神上的折磨。希特勒的刽子手以唆使猎犬扼杀战俘为乐。他们的美国兄弟也唆使穷凶极恶的李承晚匪徒残害手无寸铁的人们，在他们背上烙刺“反共”字样，实行逼供，要他们表示“希望”留在南朝鲜参加反对朝鲜爱国者的战争，并逼迫他们用自己的鲜血在这些请愿书上签名。
    那些拒绝做叛徒的人们就在美国刑讯室中成十成百地被杀害。刽子手指挥官是按照参加谈判代表团的美国将军和军官的声明来干这些勾当的。在谈判中，这些将军和军官假惺惺地说有些朝鲜人不愿遣返，而就在这时候，刽子手指挥官却在以死相威胁，要求战俘在这些请愿书上签字，谁拒绝，谁就遭到屠杀和酷刑。
    美国、五角大楼都是知道这种情况的；他们都知道，但他们不但不指责这种残暴制度，而且要求把这种制度付诸实施。
    对美国统治者说来，证实了巨济岛上不可言状的暴行的柯尔生将军的供词并不是新闻。因此，这些不名誉的事实并没有引起华盛顿的恼怒。使他们动怒的，是沉默的阴谋被打破了，是两个美军将领破坏了阴谋者的纪律。但是，显然刽子手的教唆者仍然希望人民的愤怒将限于要求审讯个别的凶犯和匪徒，他们仍然希望美国统治者当前的“不愉快”能够“局部化”。
    但是，这个算盘打错了，眼光也太短浅了。
    杜德将军和柯尔生将军是执行者。谁是主谋者呢？
    实际上，美国政策和战略的领袖完全证实了杜德和柯尔生的话，他们只是斥责杜德和柯尔生走漏机密，把酷刑营的秘密告诉了全世界。美国的将军和部长们训令新的刽子手波纳将军在巨济岛继续进行暴行，这就证明他们也负有责任。
    华盛顿决掩盖不了侵略者在朝鲜的罪行，也决逃避不了他们对这些罪行的责任。他们的罪恶行为揭穿了他们的谎言。他们对战俘的罪行之所以引起人民的愤怒，不仅是因为这些罪行野蛮而可恶，而且也是因为他们假冒为善，令人作呕。美国人干这犯罪的勾当是有分工的。他们一部分人在花言巧语地扯谎，另外一部分人就在进行屠杀。在美国人甜言蜜语、满口热爱人类的时候，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员就在遭受折磨、拷打和屠杀。
    华盛顿的那些满口“人类尊严”的说教者，暗地里命令他们在朝鲜的心腹走狗使用最野蛮的手段和最残酷的刑法，意图违反日内瓦公约，迫使战俘们“自愿”拒绝遣返。华盛顿的那些“体面的”人们大谈其所谓“尊严”，使另外一些在朝鲜的“体面的”人们可以严刑虐待战俘，伪造文件，这样又使得停战谈判代表团里的另外一些“体面的”人们可以上演一幕不要脸的笑剧，破坏停战，把战争无限期地拖下去。华盛顿牌的美国“体面”人物所要的并不是和平，他们要的是无休止的战争——一种最可图利的生意。在纽约的交易所里，甚至使战争拖下去的失败，其价钱也要比任何种类的和平来得高。
    美国侵略者在巨济岛的滔天罪行不仅仅暴露了这两个美国将领，而且还揭穿了美帝国主义的一整套用花言巧语配合血腥罪行的手法。这种罪行的责任是逃不了的，撒谎也没有用处。美国统治集团发表了毫无内容的声明，来厚着脸皮抵赖他们发动罪恶的细菌战的责任，但是这种抵赖是枉然的。艾奇逊指天发誓说美国政府没有罪。可是这位“体面”政客的话和发誓能值几个钱呢？一个铜子儿都嫌太贵。
    我们知道，美国那些高居要津的伪善之徒还会不止一次地出来抵赖他们的血腥罪行的无可置辩的罪证的。他们还会用各种各样的调子来高声叫喊他们自己的“尊严”和“道德价值”的。不过我们将会知道，又一次反人类的丑恶罪行又在准备中，或者甚至于已经干出来了，而美国的机器夜莺则正对着被害者的鲜血歌唱。
    但是，人民是欺骗不了的，五角大楼和国会的先生们不但欺骗不了已经看穿了藏在美帝国主义假面具后面的是一副什么面孔的其他国家的人民，连美国本国人民也欺骗不了。时间一长，自愿或不自愿地参加这次暴行的美国兵，口风也会渐渐放松的。
    被拘留在北朝鲜的美国战俘只是在摆脱了谎言与捏造的气氛之后才发现全盘真象，他们现在已在提供揭露侵略者的证据。美国飞行员也在提供证据，揭露罪犯，向全世界宣布组织细菌战的情况，证实了调查投掷细菌弹事件的公正无私的人们所作的结论。现在，美国的将领自己也提供了关于暴行的罪证。
    俗话说得好：白纸黑字，斧头也砍不掉。华盛顿的罪犯被当场捉住，罪证确凿，于是也想拿着一柄斧头砍去柯尔生将军在白纸上写的黑字。这些“体面”的人做那种涂去他们自己的笔在国际条约上写的字迹的事情已经成了习惯，你不能期望他们还能有别的做法。
    人民不愿意战争。美国侵略者所以遭到惨败，原因就在这里。人民越来越认识到侵略的根源何在。他们看到美帝国主义者已经走上了希特勒匪帮的暴虐无道、血腥的土匪行径的道路。
