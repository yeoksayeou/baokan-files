    The Party Branches of Factories in Gaoyang County
    Should Correct the Deviation of Neglecting Propaganda Work
    Comrade Editor: Since the establishment of the propaganda network in the factories of Gaoyang County in March last year, it has developed to sixty-eight propagandists. However, most factory party branches do not pay attention to this work, and do not study issues related to the propaganda network for four or five months. The party branches and propagandists of the Minli and Jiufeng factories even believe that there is no propaganda task in the "Three-Anti" movement. Therefore, no new propagandists were developed during the "Three-Anti" movement, and no propagandist meetings were held. The seven propagandists of the Youhao Printing Factory have been approved for a year, but they have not yet filled in the propagandist registration form, and the propagandists do not know what they should do.

    At present, the party branches of these factories have not yet made plans for carrying out propaganda work for the production competition movement. As a result, the production competition movement in the factories has not been universally carried out. Some factories have not even started preparations.

    In order to universally carry out the production competition movement and welcome the upsurge of large-scale economic construction, I believe that the party branches of factories in various places must strengthen their leadership over the work of the propaganda network, hold propagandist meetings regularly, and study the work of the propaganda network. On the one hand, they should consolidate the existing propaganda network, and at the same time, they should develop new propagandists in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that every propagandist can play their due role in the production increase competition movement.

### 高阳县各工厂党的支部  应纠正忽视宣传工作的偏向

    高阳县各工厂党的支部
    应纠正忽视宣传工作的偏向
    编辑同志：高阳县各工厂自去年三月间建立宣传网，到现在已发展了六十八名宣传员。但大部分工厂的党支部并不重视这一工作，四五个月不研究有关宣传网的问题。民利和久丰两工厂的党支部和宣传员竟认为“三反”运动中没有宣传任务。所以在“三反”运动中没有发展一个新的宣传员，也没有开过宣传员会议。友好印花厂的七个宣传员，已经被批准一年了，可是至今还没有填写宣传员登记表，宣传员们都不知道自己应该作些什么。
    目前，这些工厂的党支部还没有作出关于开展生产竞赛运动的宣传工作计划，因而，各工厂的生产竞赛运动都没有普遍地开展起来，有的工厂甚至还没有做准备工作。
    为了普遍地开展生产竞赛运动，迎接大规模的经济建设高潮，我认为各地工厂的党支部必须加强对宣传网工作的领导，定期地召开宣传员会议，并研究宣传网工作，一方面巩固已有的宣传网，同时应该有计划有步骤地发展新的宣传员，做到使每一个宣传员在增产竞赛运动中能够发挥他们应有的作用。　张蒲芦
