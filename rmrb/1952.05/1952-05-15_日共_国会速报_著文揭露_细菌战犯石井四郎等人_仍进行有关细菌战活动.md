    Japanese Communist Party "Diet Express" Article Exposes That Bacterial Warfare Criminals Shiro Ishii and Others Are Still Conducting Activities Related to Bacterial Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Fourteenth] TASS, Tokyo, Thirteenth: An article published on May 10 in the Japanese Communist Party Diet Members Group's bulletin, "Diet Express," pointed out that under the pressure of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese Special Examination Bureau recently submitted a report to the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the recent activities of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals—Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano. According to this report, it can be seen that these bacterial warfare criminals are still currently engaged in activities related to bacteriology. For example, Shiro Ishii is writing a paper on bacteria, which includes methods for manufacturing bacterial filters and test tubes for culturing bacteria. Former Major General Jiro Wakamatsu now presides over a research institute for culturing bacteria. Lieutenant General Masazo Kitano manages a factory that manufactures vaccines for typhus, cholera, and other diseases, which are said to be for medicinal purposes.

    日共“国会速报”著文揭露
    细菌战犯石井四郎等人仍进行有关细菌战活动
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社东京十三日讯：日本共产党国会议员团发行的公报“国会速报”五月十日刊载的一篇文章指出：在日本共产党的压力下，日本特别审查局最近向众议院外务委员会提出了一份关于日本细菌战犯——石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏——最近的活动的报告。从这个报告看来，可以知道这些细菌战犯目前还在从事有关细菌方面的活动。例如，石井四郎正在写一篇关于细菌的论文，其中包括制造细菌过滤器及作为培养细菌之用的试管的方法。前少将若松次郎现在主持一个培养细菌的研究机构。北野政藏中将则管理一家制造斑疹伤寒、霍乱和其他疾病的疫苗的工厂，据说这些疫苗是作医药用途的。
