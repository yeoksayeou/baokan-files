Under the New Democratic regime, our working class has become the master of the country. The responsibility of the working class is to unite the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, realize the industrialization of the country, and strive to transform to socialism and finally realize a communist society. If the working class wants to shoulder its great historical task, it must improve its political, cultural, and technical level. Comrade Stalin once taught us: "If the working class cannot get rid of the state of being uncultured, if it cannot create its own intellectuals, if it does not master science and cannot use science as a basis for managing the economy, it cannot become the true master of the country." The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have always emphasized the extreme importance of raising the political, cultural, and technical level of the working class. Therefore, seriously studying politics, culture, and technology has become a very important political task for the working class.

For more than three years, under the leadership of the Party, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions has extensively carried out on-the-job vocational education for workers. In the early days of liberation, relatively universal political enlightenment education was carried out. Later, in combination with the political and economic tasks of various periods, especially in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and increase production and practice economy, quite extensive patriotic and communist education was carried out. In a relatively long period of time, relatively regular on-the-job vocational cultural education and technical education have been carried out. Up to now, 500,000 workers have been organized to participate in on-the-job cultural studies, and 180,000 workers have been organized to participate in on-the-job technical studies. This has achieved great results in raising the awareness and cultural and technical level of the working class, and in restoring and developing Northeast economic construction. However, judging from the overall situation, on-the-job vocational education cannot be said to have received enough attention from us. On-the-job vocational education has not been able to adapt to the needs of the current and future large-scale economic construction and the development of various construction undertakings, and lacks systematic and planned comprehensive development. To this end, the General Assembly hereby makes the following resolutions:

I. It is necessary to conduct systematic political education among industrial workers on a regular basis: In addition to continuing to regularly invite Party reporters to give reports and conduct current affairs and policy studies, at present, all employees should be actively mobilized to participate in Party consolidation studies on a voluntary basis. After the Party consolidation education is over, it will be transferred to regular political studies. Employees with elementary school degrees will study the "Political Common Sense Textbook," and employees with junior high school degrees or above will study the "Chinese Revolution Reader," while taking the "History of the Chinese Workers' Movement" as a supplementary textbook. After two years, it will be connected with the academic system of theoretical education. (Engineers and technicians and staff with higher education should be organized to participate in on-the-job cadre theory study.) It is required to conduct an education on the Communist Party and communism for employees in general within two years, so that they can understand the nature and propositions of the Party and strive for the cause of communism.

II. In terms of cultural education, strive to eliminate illiteracy among existing industrial workers within the next three years. Employees who have not graduated from elementary school should be organized to study culture in a planned way.

III. In terms of technical learning, we should extensively mobilize and organize the masses of workers to learn technical operating procedures and advanced operating methods. Employees with an elementary school education or above should organize regular technical learning according to needs and on a voluntary basis, dividing into classes and subjects, and connecting with specialized industrial technical schools as much as possible. It is required to train industrial workers of different levels into skilled workers, skilled technicians, technical cadres, and production management cadres within three to five years.

IV. Time allocation: At present, each employee should generally participate in two political (Party consolidation) studies per week. After transitioning to regular political studies, participate in one political study per week or every two weeks. Under normal circumstances, illiterate employees and employees who have not graduated from elementary school should focus on cultural studies, with three study times per week (one and a half hours each time). In terms of technical learning, the main methods are decentralized and flexible methods such as technical research meetings, seminars, and apprenticeship contracts. When necessary, a technical operation procedure or safety procedure education will be conducted centrally once a week or every two weeks. Employees with an elementary school education or above should, according to their needs and on a voluntary basis, focus on regular technical learning; some should focus on systematic political learning, and some can enter vocational high schools and still focus on cultural learning. There should be three study times per week. Those who focus on regular technical learning and those who still focus on cultural learning must participate in one political study per week.

V. Leadership: Under the unified leadership of the Party, the work of the provincial and municipal workers' vocational education committees should be strengthened to unify thinking, unify steps, and better carry out work. At the grassroots level, vocational education committees are generally not established. Each factory and mine can establish a unified educational organization form - a workers' vocational school - according to the actual situation, and be directly led by the factory management committee. Major issues such as education plans, time, and teachers should be discussed and decided by the factory management committee, and then handed over to the workers' vocational school for specific implementation. And under the leadership of the Party committee, conduct regular and comprehensive inspection work.

VI. Education funds: Paid from the trade union cultural and educational funds, and when insufficient, relevant parties should be asked for subsidies to appropriately enrich various teaching needs.

    东北总工会第二届代表大会关于进一步开展职工业余学习的决议
    （一九五二年一月二十日）
    在新民主主义政权下，我们工人阶级已经成为国家的主人。工人阶级的责任就是在中国共产党领导下团结全国人民，巩固人民民主专政，实现国家工业化，并为转变到社会主义和最后实现共产主义社会而斗争。工人阶级要想担负起自己的伟大的历史任务，就必须提高自己的政治、文化、技术水平。斯大林同志曾经教导我们：“工人阶级如果不能摆脱无文化的状态，如果它不能造就它自己的知识分子，如果它不掌握科学，不能用科学做基础来管理经济，它就不能成为国家真正主人。”中国共产党中央和毛主席历来都提出必须注意提高工人阶级的政治、文化和技术的水平的极端重要性。因此，认真学习政治、文化、技术已成为工人阶级一个十分重大的政治任务。
    三年多来，东北总工会在党的领导下，已经广泛地展开了职工业余教育工作，解放初期比较普遍地进行了政治启蒙教育，以后结合各个时期的政治任务与经济任务，尤其是在抗美援朝、镇压反革命和增产节约运动中进行了相当广泛的爱国主义和共产主义教育；并且在长时期内比较经常地进行了职工业余文化教育和技术教育，到现在已经组织了五十万职工参加了业余文化学习，组织了十八万职工参加了业余技术学习。这对于提高工人阶级的觉悟和文化技术水平，对于恢复和发展东北经济建设，都获有很大的成绩。但是，从整个情况来看，职工业余教育还不能说已经引起我们足够的重视，职工业余教育还未能适应当前和今后大规模经济建设和各项建设事业发展的需要，还缺乏有系统、有计划地全面开展。为此，大会特作如下决议：
    一、必须在产业工人中经常地进行有系统的政治教育：除了继续经常请党的报告员作报告，进行时事政策学习外，在目前，应积极动员全体职工以自愿原则参加整党学习。整党教育结束后，即转入经常的政治学习，初等学校程度的职工学习“政治常识课本”，初中以上程度的职工学习“中国革命读本”，同时以“中国职工运动史”作为补助教材。两年以后即与理论教育的学年制相衔接。（工程师和文化程度较高的技术人员和职员应组织他们参加在职干部理论学习。）要求两年之内普遍向职工进行一次关于共产党与共产主义的教育，使他们认识党的性质和主张，并为共产主义事业而奋斗。
    二、在文化教育方面，争取今后三年之内扫除现有产业职工中的文盲。不够初等学校毕业程度的职工，要有计划地组织文化学习。
    三、在技术学习方面，应广泛动员与组织工人群众进行技术操作规程和先进操作方法的学习。初等学校文化程度以上的职工，根据需要与自愿组织正规技术学习，分班分科，并尽可能与专门工业技术学校相衔接。要求三、五年内将不同程度的产业工人培养成为熟练工人、熟练的技术工人与技术干部和生产管理干部。
    四、时间分配：目前一般的每个职工每周应参加两次政治（整党）学习。转为经常的政治学习以后，每周或每两周参加一次政治学习。在通常的情况下，文盲和不够初等学校毕业程度的职工，应以文化学习为主，每周应有三次学习时间（每次一个半小时）。在技术学习方面，主要采取技术研究会、座谈会、师徒合同等分散灵活的方式进行，必要时每周或每两周集中地进行一次技术操作规程或保安规程的教育。初等学校以上程度的职工，根据需要和自愿原则，有的应以正规技术学习为重点；有的应以系统的政治学习为重点，有的则可进业余中学，仍以文化学习为重点。每周均应有三次学习时间。以正规技术学习和仍以文化学习为重点的，每周都必须进行一次政治学习。
    五、领导：应在党的统一领导下加强省、市职工业余教育委员会的工作，以统一思想，统一步调，更好地开展工作。在基层，一般的不成立职工业余教育委员会，各厂矿可根据实际情况成立统一的教育组织形式——职工业余学校，并由工厂管理委员会直接领导。有关教育计划、时间、教员等重大问题，经工厂管理委员会讨论决定以后，交职工业余学校具体执行。并在党委领导下定期进行全面检查工作。
    六、教育经费：由工会文教经费中开支，不足时酌请有关方面补助，以适当充实教学上的各种需用。
