    A Brief Commentary on Economic Life

    In coal mines and the ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries, the speed and quality of drilling operations are closely related to the speed and quality of basic mine construction. It is impossible to design without sufficient drilling data; the accuracy of drilling data is inseparable from the accuracy of engineering design. Without this year's drilling work, we will not be able to sink new shafts or expand old ones next year or the year after. Currently, the weakness of drilling capacity in some areas has already limited the progress of mine basic construction design and construction. In order to accelerate the preparatory work for large-scale economic construction, vigorous drilling has become an urgent task.

    The Ma Wenzhi drilling team of the Fuxin Mining Bureau in Northeast China has opportunely created a set of advanced experiences. The Ma Wenzhi team has carried out a series of reforms in operating techniques and management methods: accelerating the revolutions per minute of the drilling rig to achieve rapid drilling; shortening auxiliary production time as much as possible to increase drilling time; implementing a system of specialized division of labor, strengthening discipline, and strictly implementing an inspection system to ensure project quality and safety, and improve drilling efficiency. At present, the drilling projects of most of our mines are still in their initial stages, cadres lack experience, and equipment and skilled workers are insufficient; to do this work well requires great effort. The experience of the Ma Wenzhi drilling team is a practical and feasible way to fully utilize the potential of drilling rigs, improve drilling efficiency, and ensure project quality under the existing manpower and equipment conditions.

    In the past, most mine leaders emphasized production and neglected basic construction, especially the geological drilling work. This situation was unavoidable during the period focused on restoring production; but now, in order to prepare for the upcoming large-scale economic construction, this must be quickly changed. Otherwise, it will delay the speed of our mine basic construction.

    Promoting an advanced experience is carrying out a production reform, whether large or small. Before promotion, various complex and meticulous ideological education work, organizational work, and various necessary material preparations must be carried out; during the promotion process, not only must these tasks continue to be carried out, but also reforms of labor organization, various quotas, and the wage system must be carried out. Leading cadres of administrative departments and trade union organizations in various state-owned mines must fully recognize the great significance of drilling work, devote a certain amount of effort to earnestly leading drilling work, vigorously promote the advanced experience of the Ma Wenzhi team, so that drilling work can be developed rapidly to meet the needs of basic construction and greet the upcoming high tide of economic construction.

### 马文志小组的先进经验应当在全国各矿山普遍推广

    马文志小组的先进经验应当在全国各矿山普遍推广
    在煤矿和黑色金属、有色金属工业中，钻探工程施工的速度和质量，和矿山的基本建设的速度、质量有密切的关系。没有足够的钻探资料就不可能进行设计；钻探资料的是否正确，和工程设计的是否正确是分不开的。没有今年的钻探工程，明年、后年我们就无法开凿新井或扩大旧井。目前，有些地区由于钻探力量的薄弱，已经限制了矿山基本建设的设计和施工的进度。为了加速进行大规模经济建设的准备工作，大力进行钻探已成为刻不容缓的任务了。
    东北阜新矿务局马文志钻探小组适时地创造出了一套先进经验。马文志小组在操作技术以及管理方法上，进行了一系列的改革：加速钻机的转数，实行了快速钻进；尽可能地缩短辅助生产时间，增加了钻进时间；实行了专责分工制，加强纪律，严格实行检查制度，保证了工程质量和安全，提高了钻进效率。目前我们各矿山的钻探工程，一般都还在开始，干部经验缺乏，设备和技术工人不足；要做好这一件工作，还须要进行很大的努力。马文志钻探小组的经验，正是在现有的人力和设备的情况下，充分发挥钻机潜在能力，提高钻进效率，保证工程质量的切实可行的办法。
    过去，多数矿山的领导干部，重视生产而忽视基本建设，对于地质钻探工作尤其不够重视。这种情况在以恢复生产为主的时期是难免的；但现在为了准备即将到来的大规模经济建设，就必须很快地加以转变。不然，就将延缓我们矿山基本建设的速度。
    推广一个先进经验，就是进行一次或大或小的生产改革。在推广之前，要进行各种复杂的细致的思想教育工作、组织工作以及各种必要的物质准备；在推广过程中，不但要继续进行这些工作，并且要进行劳动组织、各种定额以及工资制度的改革。各个国营矿山行政方面和工会组织的领导干部们，必须充分认识钻探工作的重大意义，拿出一定力量，认真领导钻探工作，大力推广马文志小组的先进经验，使钻探工作能够很快地发展，以满足基本建设的需要，迎接即将到来的经济建设的高潮。
