　　Welcoming the Indian Cultural Delegation
　　Ding Xilin
　　China and India are the two most populous countries in Asia and the world. South of our Tibet and Xikang lies the Indian territory. The border between our two countries stretches for more than six thousand li. Despite the barriers of the Pamirs and the Himalayas, China and India have had long-term cultural and economic exchanges. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between our two countries have been steadily strengthening.
　　The friendly relations between the people of China and India have a long history. As early as the 6th century, the Indian community residing in Luoyang, China, numbered as many as three thousand. Among them were not only missionaries and translators of Buddhist scriptures, but also merchants and doctors. At that time, there were also many Indian residents in Chang'an, Nanjing, Guangzhou and other cities in China. In the 7th century, Master Xuanzang went to India to study and lived in northern India for sixteen years. When he returned home, he used twenty horses to carry back 657 volumes of scriptures and other manuscripts, contributing to the cultural exchange between China and India. During the Song Dynasty, many merchants from Fujian and Guangdong went to southwestern India for business. These historical friendships between the people of the two countries are worth cherishing.
　　With the advent of the people's era, the friendly relations between China and India have developed on a brand new foundation. Last year, India-China Friendship Associations were successively established in eight places in northern India, including Calcutta, Mumbai, Banaras, Dehradun, Patiala, and Kapurthala; India-China Friendship Associations were also established in the southern cities of Hyderabad and Mysore. A monthly magazine in Indian language was also published in Banaras, specializing in reporting on the situation in New China. China sent representatives to participate in botany conferences, statistics conferences, film exhibitions, and industrial exhibitions held in India. The cultural delegation invited by the Indian government also visited various parts of India last winter for more than forty days and was warmly received by the Indian government and people. These are new developments in the friendly relations between the people of China and India.
　　In today's world, due to the demands of the times, the people of the two great nations of China and India need to establish more friendly relations and strive for peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the friendship between China and India not only represents the wishes of the people of the two great nations, but also represents the wishes of all mankind.
　　Now the Indian cultural delegation has come to China for a visit at the invitation of our government. The people of our country warmly welcome them. We hope that during their visit, the Indian cultural delegation will have more contact with people from all walks of life in our country and visit various places to enhance understanding and friendship between the people of China and India. The members of the Indian cultural delegation include parliamentarians, educators, archaeologists, lawyers, economists, engineers, physicists, as well as writers, dancers, painters, and newspaper editors. We believe that the friendly relations between the two nations of China and India will be further strengthened by their arrival. We hereby wish the Indian cultural delegation a successful visit to our country and that they will be able to achieve better and newer achievements on the basis of the existing friendship between the two countries.

　　欢迎印度文化代表团
    丁西林
    中国和印度两个国家，在亚洲以及在全世界上都是人口最多的。在我国的西藏和西康以南，就是印度的版图。我们两国境界毗连达六千余里。尽管有帕米尔和喜马拉雅天险的阻隔，中印两国在文化上和经济上长期都有往来。在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们两国友好的关系正日益加强起来。
    中印两国人民的友好关系本来是有悠久的历史的。早在六世纪时，居留中国洛阳的印度侨民曾多至三千。其中不但有传教的、翻译佛经的，而且有经商的和行医的。当时中国长安、南京、广州和其它城市中也有许多印度侨民。七世纪时玄奘大师赴印留学，在印度北部居住十六年之久。他返国时，曾用二十匹马载回经典和其它抄本六百五十七卷，对于中印文化交流有所贡献。宋时，闽粤商人到印度西南部经商的很多。两国人民在历史上的这些友谊是值得我们珍视的。
    随着人民时代的到来，中印的友好关系在一个崭新的基础上发展起来了。去年印度北部加尔各答、孟买、班拿勒斯、杜拉屯、巴地阿拉、卡普塔拉等八个地方，先后成立印中友好协会；南部海特拉巴和麦耶索二市也成立印中友好协会。在班拿勒斯还出版了印度文的月刊，专门报道新中国的情况。印度举行植物学会议、统计学会议、电影展览会、工业展览会等，我国都派了代表前往参加，我们被印度政府邀请的文化代表团去冬也在印度访问各地，历时四十余日，曾受到印度政府和人民的热烈招待。这些都是中印两国人民友好关系的新发展。
    在今天的世界上，由于时代的要求，中印两大民族人民需要建立更加友好的关系，为亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗。因此，中印的友好不但是代表两大民族人民的愿望，也是代表了全人类的愿望。
    现在印度文化代表团应我国政府之请，到中国来访问了。我国人民热诚地欢迎他们。我们希望印度文化代表团在访问的期间，能和我国各方面人士多多接触，并赴各地参观，以增进中印两国人民之间的了解和友谊。印度文化代表团团员中有议员、教育家、考古家、法律家、经济学家、工程师、物理学家，也有文学家、舞蹈家、画家和报馆主笔。我们相信，中印两个民族的友好关系，将因他们的到来而更为加强。我们在这里预祝印度文化代表团访问我国，必能在两国已有的友谊基础上，完成更好的和更新的成就。
