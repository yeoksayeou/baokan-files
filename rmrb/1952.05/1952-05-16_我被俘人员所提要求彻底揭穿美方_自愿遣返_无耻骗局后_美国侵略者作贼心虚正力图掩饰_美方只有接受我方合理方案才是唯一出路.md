Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th. After the demands made by our captured personnel on Geoje Island thoroughly exposed the U.S. side's brutal behavior in the prisoner-of-war camps and unmasked the U.S. side's shameless "voluntary repatriation" fraud, the U.S. aggressors, with a guilty conscience, were greatly alarmed and are now scrambling to try to cover it up.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Seoul on the 13th, the response by the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp负责人负责人 responsible person, Colson, to the demands raised by our captured personnel "caused confusion and even panic in the Washington Defense Department." A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 14th also stated that "diplomatic officials here do not hesitate to say that they feel extremely embarrassed by this entire incident. They say that undoubtedly, this will cause the United States to 'lose face' throughout the Orient at this critical moment." The reason why the U.S. aggressors are so flustered is obvious. The executioner Ridgway, who single-handedly created the bloody incident of massacring our captured personnel, confessed without being forced: "If the conditions stipulated by the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp prisoners when General Dodd was released are made public again, it will seriously affect the Korean armistice negotiations." (Agence France-Presse, San Francisco, 13th) This means that the demands raised by our captured personnel and Colson's response have irrefutably proven that the so-called "voluntary repatriation" stubbornly insisted upon by the U.S. side is entirely a grand conspiracy to persecute and forcibly detain our captured personnel. From now on, the U.S. side can no longer use all kinds of nonsense to deceive the people of the world, and can no longer continue to shamelessly talk about its so-called "humanitarian" "voluntary repatriation" in the armistice negotiations. The U.S. side's conspiracy to deliberately obstruct and sabotage the armistice negotiations has now been completely exposed.

In order to cover up their embarrassing situation, the U.S. aggressors, on the one hand, dismissed Colson, the person in charge of the prisoner-of-war camp, as a scapegoat, and on the other hand, hurriedly issued an extremely absurd statement from the U.S. Department of Defense on the 13th,妄想妄想 vainly attempting to shamelessly cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world with a piece of paper filled with lies. The U.S. Department of Defense shamelessly argued in the statement that Colson's "statement regarding the bloodshed and atrocities refers to the incidents caused by the previous riots of prisoners in the prisoner-of-war camp." This kind of sophistry by the U.S. Department of Defense is a futile attempt. Countless messages sent by American journalists from Geoje Island have long confirmed the various barbaric atrocities committed by the U.S. side against our captured personnel. A United Press International dispatch from Geoje Island on January 20th admitted that "in the officers' detention camp, a straightforward communist was hung up and beaten unconscious." United Press International also admitted that "the center of the concentration camp has become an island of terror," and "torture and assassination are interwoven into a terrifying picture in the daily life of prisoners." As for the so-called "incidents caused by the riots of prisoners" in the mouth of the U.S. Department of Defense, everyone knows that they are actually the barbaric measures taken by the U.S. side after its attempt to force our captured personnel to accept its "voluntary repatriation" principle failed. The truth about the U.S. side's collective massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island on February 18th has also been completely revealed by the Associated Press's dispatch. The U.S. aggressors'妄想妄想 vain attempt to cover up all their crimes with the bloody incidents they created is like a murderer using blood-stained hands to wipe his blood-splattered face. What effect can it have other than further exposing their crimes?

The U.S. Department of Defense also shamelessly said in its statement: "The treatment received by the prisoners on Geoje Island is in accordance with the principles of the Geneva Convention and the generally accepted practices of civilized countries." There is nothing more shameless than this hypocrisy of the U.S. aggressors. Not only have the various atrocities committed by the U.S. side on Geoje Island, as revealed by American news agencies, long proven that the U.S. aggressors are destroyers of the Geneva Convention and all international conventions, but Colson, the person in charge of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, also said in his reply to our captured personnel: "I can assure you that prisoners of war in this prisoner-of-war camp can expect to receive humanitarian treatment in accordance with the principles of international law in the future." This admits that the U.S. side has never given our captured personnel humanitarian treatment in accordance with the principles of international law in the past and present. The U.S. aggressors even dare to openly violate the solemn principles and practices that prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the armistice. What qualifications do they have to talk about the Geneva Convention and the generally accepted practices of civilized countries?

The U.S. Department of Defense fabricated a rumor that the "rearming" of prisoners of war, which was admitted in Colson's reply, was "added by the communists." However, the United Nations Command Headquarters in Tokyo, which has a guilty conscience, was not so bold. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 13th: "The United Nations Command Headquarters here has consistently refused to explain what the term 'rearming' prisoners of war in the Allied prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island in South Korea means." In any case, the fact is that the U.S. side colluded with the special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to continuously persecute our captured personnel in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, forcing them to write blood oaths, forcing them to tattoo their bodies, and sending them to the remnant bandits of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder. This has been confirmed by many messages revealed by American news agencies and newspapers. For example, the Washington dispatch published in the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" on April 18th stated: "Reports from Korea say that Chinese and North Korean prisoners on Geoje Island are being transported away. It is believed that this means that prisoners whose names have been removed (from the new list) are being relocated elsewhere. If they are no longer prisoners, then obviously they cannot be kept in prisoner-of-war camps. It is expected that most of them will join the South Korean army." In the face of such irrefutable evidence, it is not difficult for people to understand what the United Nations Command Headquarters "refuses to explain" what it means to "rearm" prisoners of war.

The contradictory statement of the U.S. Department of Defense eventually became delirious. In order to deny the crime of forcibly screening our captured personnel, the U.S. Department of Defense even said extremely logically chaotic words in a panic, stating: "When using the term 'forced screening,' General Colson was apparently referring to the fact that some communist leaders in the prisoner-of-war camps had attempted to prevent other prisoners from freely expressing their wishes on this issue." According to the logic of the U.S. Department of Defense, the meaning of "forced screening" is to oppose "screening"!? People see, to what degree have the American warmongers panicked and become incoherent! However, from this bizarre logic, people can see the truth on the other side, that is: since there is opposition to "screening," then there must be "forced screening" undoubtedly. Therefore, the U.S. Department of Defense's attempt to deny "forced screening" with bizarre logic instead confirmed the existence of "forced screening." This is really lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet.

The U.S. aggressors' criminal acts of violating international conventions,虐杀虐杀 torturing and massacring, and forcibly detaining a large number of our captured personnel have now been completely exposed in front of the people of the world. The U.S. side's unreasonable plan in the armistice negotiations has been completely proven to be a despicable and shameless grand conspiracy and grand fraud. No matter how the U.S. aggressors quibble or cover up, these iron-like facts and evidence cannot be denied at all. The only way out for the U.S. side is to honestly withdraw its absurd and unreasonable plan and accept our only reasonable plan of May 2nd. Otherwise, the serious responsibility for delaying and even sabotaging the armistice negotiations will be entirely borne by the U.S. side.

### 我被俘人员所提要求彻底揭穿美方“自愿遣返”无耻骗局后  美国侵略者作贼心虚正力图掩饰  美方只有接受我方合理方案才是唯一出路

    我被俘人员所提要求彻底揭穿美方“自愿遣返”无耻骗局后
    美国侵略者作贼心虚正力图掩饰
    美方只有接受我方合理方案才是唯一出路
    【新华社开城十五日电】在巨济岛我方被俘人员所提出的要求彻底揭露了美方在俘虏营中的残暴行为并拆穿了美方所谓“自愿遣返”的无耻骗局之后，作贼心虚的美国侵略者大为恐慌，正在手忙脚乱地竭力企图加以掩饰。
    据合众社汉城十三日电，美方俘虏营负责人柯尔生对我方被俘人员所提出的要求的答复，“在华盛顿国防部引起了混乱，甚至引起了惊恐”。合众社华盛顿十四日电也说，“此间的外交官员们并不讳言他们对这整个事件感到极端难堪。他们说，无疑的，这将使美国在这个紧要的时候在整个东方‘丢脸’。”美国侵略者之所以这样张皇失措，原因是十分明显的。一手制造了屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事件的刽子手李奇微就不打自招供认：“如果再公布巨济岛俘虏营战俘在释放杜德将军时所规定的条件，那会使朝鲜停战谈判受到严重影响。”（法新社旧金山十三日电）这就是说，我方被俘人员提出的要求和柯尔生的答复，已经不可辩驳地证明了美方所顽固坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”完全是迫害和强行扣留我方被俘人员的大阴谋。美方从此再不能用种种胡说八道的鬼话来欺骗世界人民，再也不能继续厚着脸皮在停战谈判中大谈其什么“人道主义”的
    “自愿遣返”了。美方蓄意阻挠和破坏停战谈判的阴谋，至此已经暴露无遗。
    为了掩饰自己出乖露丑的窘态，美国侵略者一面将俘虏营负责人柯尔生撤职，作为替罪的羔羊，一面赶紧由美国国防部在十三日发表了一个荒谬已极的声明，妄想无耻地用一纸谎言遮尽天下人的耳目。美国国防部在声明中无耻地狡赖说：柯尔生的
    “声明中所提到的流血事件和暴行是指以前俘虏营中俘虏的暴动所造成的事件而言”。美国国防部这种狡辩是枉费心机的。美国记者从巨济岛发出来的无数消息，早就证实了美方对我方被俘人员的种种野蛮暴行。合众社巨济岛一月二十日电就承认：“在军官的拘留营内，一个说话直率的共产党人被吊起来打得人事不知。”合众社还承认：“集中营中心变成了一个恐怖之岛”，“酷刑、暗杀在俘虏日常生活中交织成一幅恐怖的图画”。而美国国防部口中的所谓“俘虏的暴动所造成的事件”，谁都知道实际上是美方妄图强迫我方被俘人员接受其“自愿遣返”原则遭受失败后所采取的野蛮手段。美方在二月十八日集体屠杀巨济岛上我方被俘人员的真相，也已经由美联社的电讯透露无遗。美国侵略者妄想用自己一手造成的流血事件来掩饰自己的全部罪行，正像杀人犯用染满了血的手来揩自己的溅了血的脸一样，除了使自己的罪行更加暴露而外，还能有什么作用呢？
    美国国防部在其声明中还无耻地说：“巨济岛俘虏所受的待遇是符合日内瓦公约的原则和文明国家所公认的惯例的。”没有比美国侵略者这种伪善更无耻了。不但美国通讯社所透露出来的美方在巨济岛上的种种暴行，早就证明美国侵略者是日内瓦公约和一切国际公约的破坏者，就是美方俘虏营负责人柯尔生在他给我方被俘人员的答复中也说：“我可以向你们提出保证，将来这个俘虏营里的战俘可以希望得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇。”这就供认了美方过去和现在根本就没有给予我方被俘人员以符合国际法原则的人道待遇。美国侵略者连停战以后战俘应即予释放和遣返的庄严原则与惯例都敢公然予以破坏，还有什么资格来谈日内瓦公约和文明国家所公认的惯例呢？
    美国国防部把柯尔生的答复中所供认的“重新武装”战俘这一点，造谣说是“共产党加进去的”。但是在东京的作贼心虚的联合国军司令部却没有这样胆大包天。据路透社东京十三日电：“此间联合国军司令部今日还一直拒绝解释‘重新武装’南朝鲜巨济岛联军俘虏营的战俘一词是什么意思。”不管如何，事实是美方勾结了蒋介石、李承晚匪帮的特务分子，在美方战俘营中不断迫害我方被俘人员，强迫他们写血书，强迫他们在身上刺字，把他们送给台湾的蒋介石残余匪帮和李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。这已由美国的通讯社和报纸所透露出来的许多消息所证实了。例如：四月十八日的“纽约世界电讯太阳报”所载的华盛顿通讯就说：“朝鲜传来的报道说，巨济岛上的中国和北朝鲜的俘虏正在被运走。人们相信，这就意味着，（在新名单上）被除去名字的俘虏正被移居到别处。如果他们不再是俘虏，那末显然不能把他们关在俘虏营里。预料他们之中大多数将加入南朝鲜军。”在这样的推翻不了的证据面前，人们就不难了解联合国军司令部“拒绝解释”“重新武装”战俘是什么意思了。
    美国国防部的矛盾百出的声明，到最后简直成了胡言呓语。美国国防部为了抵赖对我方被俘人员进行强迫甄别的罪行，竟然慌乱地说出了逻辑极度混乱的话，声明说：“在使用‘强迫甄别’一词时，柯尔生将军显然是指一些俘虏营中的共产党领袖曾企图阻止其他俘虏在这个问题上自由表示他们的意愿这一事实而言。”照美国国防部的逻辑，“强迫甄别”的意思是反对“甄别”！？人们看，美国战争贩子已经慌乱到怎样语无伦次的地步啊！不过，人们从这个怪诞的逻辑中倒可以看到另一面的真理，这就是：既然有反对“甄别”，那就必有“强迫甄别”无疑了。因此，美国国防部企图用怪诞的逻辑来否认“强迫甄别”结果却反而证实了“强迫甄别”的存在，这真是搬起石头打自己的脚了。
    美国侵略者破坏国际公约、虐杀、强扣我方大批被俘人员的罪恶行为，现在已经在全世界人民面前彻底暴露了。美方在停战谈判中的蛮横无理的方案，完全被证明是一个卑鄙无耻的大阴谋，大骗局。无论美国侵略者怎样狡赖，怎样掩饰，这铁一般的事实和证据是绝对抵赖不了的。美方唯一的出路是老老实实收回其荒谬无理的方案，接受我方五月二日的唯一合理的方案，否则拖延以至破坏停战谈判的严重责任，完全要由美方担负。
