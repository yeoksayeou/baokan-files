    Always Forward
    ——Words from a Literary Worker Undergoing Transformation
    Cao Yu
    Ten years ago, on May 23rd, Chairman Mao published "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Since then, Chinese revolutionary literary workers have obtained a correct guide. In the period of old China, which was full of disasters, Chairman Mao's "Talks" resolutely and forcefully directed us. Today, China has stood up, and the high tide of economic construction is about to arrive. The working people of the whole country are even more urgently in need of rich cultural nourishment. Therefore, revolutionary literary workers should redouble their efforts to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.
    In the past ten years, all literary workers who have honestly and sincerely studied and followed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line have gained certain achievements and produced works praised by the working people, some of which have also won international acclaim. Those who study this "Talks" with a dishonest attitude and do not seriously transform themselves have encountered setbacks and failures in literary creation.
    I am a literary worker who came from the dark old society. Although I have always yearned for the light, my own ideology has been deeply influenced by bourgeois thought. When the new society arrived, I unexpectedly became a member of thousands of revolutionary literary workers, a member of Chairman Mao's literary team. How grateful and proud I am! But how timid I am, as if a blind man who has just opened his eyes has come into contact with dazzling sunlight for the first time. In the irrepressible excitement, I don't know how to take the first step. For many years, I was divorced from the revolutionary masses and divorced from the practical life of the masses. When I suddenly saw the bright things I had been longing for, I felt that I could not embrace them like relatives right away.
    I began to study Chairman Mao's "Talks" attentively. I knew that it would be futile to prove that I was a writer of the people by using grand pronouncements, declarations, or shoddy works. Workers, peasants, and soldiers hope to read works that faithfully reflect their real lives and their thoughts and feelings. They do not need people pretending to be workers, peasants, and soldiers to appear on stage, nor do they need substitutes to be promoted in front of them. One can express subjective wishes to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but the masses will only honestly look at his goods, his behavior, and his writings. Chairman Mao taught us: "Social practice is the criterion for testing subjective wishes, and effect is the criterion for testing motives." This is absolutely true.
    I gradually realized my emptiness. I was not familiar with workers, not familiar with peasants, not familiar with soldiers, and I did not know Marxism-Leninism. I lacked new experiences of social reality, and I was not even very familiar with the language of the masses. There is an old saying, "Poverty without a foothold." Today I understand how painful it is for a person to reach the point of "poverty without a foothold" in the spiritual realm.
    At this moment, I heard the great guiding voice in Chairman Mao's "Talks": "Understand them, be familiar with them," so that "one's thoughts and feelings should be integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants and soldiers." I also heard: "To be one with the masses, one must be determined. After a long and even painful tempering."
    These instructions are deeply imprinted in my mind. Yes, we should become familiar with what we are not familiar with, and we should understand what we have not understood. Unless we have no enthusiasm for the people's cause, unless we always take a cold-eyed attitude towards the struggles and victories of the people and their vanguard, when we see the light of the motherland and see the noble qualities of the working people, we must enthusiastically sing praises. All difficulties should be overcome, and must be overcome. All the rotten things entangled in the roots of the ideological consciousness of the big and small bourgeoisie should be cut off. New life cannot sprout from such old and decayed roots, and the people's literature and art of New China cannot grow on it. One must move from one class to another, and one must transform one's thoughts and feelings. Even if it is a long and painful tempering, one must go through it step by step, like many pioneering New China literary workers.
    To change, to transform, I should calm down and carefully examine my own ideological consciousness, how much of it belongs to the masses of the people, and how much is not of the people. Sets of supra-class concepts of good and evil, right and wrong, are faintly and deeply rooted in my previous works, and some even clamor wildly. I claim that I hate the dark old society and am dissatisfied with the bloody facts of people oppressing people, and I also say that the feudal forces and the evil rule of the bureaucratic comprador must be overthrown. However, I am a supra-class believer in human nature, and I believe that in such a class society, human nature is also universally good. I have never clearly realized that everyone has their own class nature. I did not understand that the objective determines the subjective, that being determines the consciousness, and that the objective reality of class struggle and national struggle determines our thoughts and emotions.
    I understand that my spiritual realm was not just poor, that was a nice term, a evasive excuse found by an old intellectual when he was cornered. In fact, in my ideological consciousness, it was not as progressive or as wholeheartedly pursuing truth and light as I had previously claimed. There is a large pile of unexposed scrap metal in my warehouse, a pile of musty wood. If I don't honestly study Marxism-Leninism, and if I don't thoroughly liquidate my thoughts according to Mao Zedong Thought, these decadent things will still be there.
    It is difficult for an intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background who has not undergone thorough transformation to forget the characters, thoughts, and emotions that he has been attached to for many years. Like ants circling a tree, they always revolve around that dark place. I remember that during the period of reactionary rule, in Chongqing, which was full of secret agents, when I first read "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I seemed to immediately understand that literature and art were of course for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Is there still a problem with this? But when I read about what the masses of the people are and who literature and art are for, I found that I could also write for the petty bourgeoisie, and I was secretly pleased, thinking that the kind of life and characters I was familiar with could still be used. As long as I could use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint, it would be fine. At that time, although I had read one or two social science books, I really couldn't understand what Marxism-Leninism was all about. Now I realize that this is the petty-bourgeois consciousness taking advantage of loopholes. It is not easy to truly grasp the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method. The author of "Between Husband and Wife" stood on the stand of the petty bourgeoisie and wrote about revolutionary cadres, resulting in the distortion of the image of revolutionary cadres. This is a lesson.
    Ten years ago, Chairman Mao said in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "People from petty-bourgeois backgrounds always stubbornly express themselves, propagate their own views, and demand that people transform the Party and transform the world according to the appearance of petty-bourgeois intellectuals through various methods, including literary and artistic methods. Under such circumstances, our job is to shout loudly to them, saying: 'Comrades,' your set is not working. The proletariat and the masses of the people cannot accommodate you. If we follow you, we are actually following the big landlords and the big bourgeoisie, and there is a danger of losing the Party, the country, and our heads."
    Our great leader has given such powerful instructions.
    I remember writing compositions in private schools in my childhood, writing things like "Dayu Cherishing Every Inch of Time." Elementary school students wrote about shortcomings similar to how they usually didn't study hard, and at the end, they always wrote two sentences like "The past is gone, the future can be pursued," but then they forgot these two sentences. Now that I think about it, if "the past is gone" only refers to time, then it has indeed passed. But "the past" should refer to one's own shortcomings. For people like me who come from a petty-bourgeois background, this shortcoming should mainly refer to bad petty-bourgeois thoughts, which cannot be "gone" with just two declarations. If one does not check at any time, does not rely on the guidance of the Party and the masses at any time, and does not thoroughly solve the problem of the relationship between the individual and the masses, then it will still be revived, and even if one goes to the masses, one cannot learn anything from the masses.
    I have been to the Huai River and participated in the land reform. During that short period, I made some mistakes, and with the help of the masses, I was corrected in time. I have not written a single word yet. This makes me deeply ashamed and painful every time I think of Chairman Mao's instructions to "go to the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers for a long, unconditional and wholehearted period, and go to the heat of the struggle."
    But I am a member of Chairman Mao's literary team, and the great construction achievements of the working people of New China encourage us, and the bright future of the whole of China calls us. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, I must study better than I do now. My own problems will cause me many difficulties, but I must gradually integrate my thoughts and feelings with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    This is an unshakable determination.

    永远向前
    ——一个在改造中的文艺工作者的话
    曹　禺
    十年前的五月二十三日，毛主席发表了“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。从此以后，中国的革命文艺工作者获得了正确的指针。在灾难深重的旧中国时期，毛主席这篇“讲话”坚决有力地指挥着我们。在今天，中国已经站起来了，经济建设的高潮眼望着就要到来，全国的劳动人民更迫切地需要丰富的文化食粮。因此，革命的文艺工作者应加倍努力来贯彻执行毛主席的文艺方针。
    十年以来，凡是老老实实、诚诚恳恳地学习和遵循了毛主席的文艺方针而工作的文艺工作者，都得到了一定的收获，做出了劳动人民所赞许的作品，有的并获得了国际上的赞扬。凡是以不老实的态度学习这篇“讲话”、不去认真改造自己的人，也就在文艺创作上遭遇到挫折和失败。
    我是一个从黑暗的旧社会里走出来的文艺工作者，虽然一直向往着光明，但自己的思想意识却受了相当深的资产阶级思想的影响。新社会到来了，我居然成为千千万万革命文艺工作者的一员，成为毛主席文艺队伍中的一员，我是多么感激和骄傲！然而我又多么胆怯，仿佛刚刚睁开眼的盲人，初次接触了耀目的阳光，在不可抑止的兴奋里，又不知道如何迈第一步。多少年来，我脱离革命的群众，脱离群众的实际生活，我猛地见了一直在渴望着的光明事物，反而觉得不能像亲人一般地立刻拥抱它。
    我开始用心学习毛主席的“讲话”。我知道如果用高谈阔论、用宣言或者粗制滥造的作品来证明自己是人民的作家，那是枉费心机。工农兵希望读到忠实地反映他们的真实生活、反映他们的思想情绪的作品，他们毫不需要冒充工农兵的人物上场，不需要一些代用品在他们面前推销。一个人可以表示主观愿望如何为了工农兵，可是群众只会老老实实地看他的货色、他的行为、他所写的作品。毛主席教导我们：“社会实践是检验主观愿望的标准，效果是检验动机的标准。”这是千真万确的。
    我逐渐发觉自己的空虚，我不熟悉工人，不熟悉农民，不熟悉士兵，也不知道马克思列宁主义。我缺乏新的社会现实的体验，甚至连人民大众的语言也不大熟悉。古人有一句话，“贫无立锥之地”。我今天才明白一个人在精神领域中到了“贫无立锥之地”的当口是多么痛苦。
    在这个当口，我从毛主席的“讲话”里听见了伟大的指路的声音：“了解他们，熟悉他们，”要使“自己的思想情绪应与工农兵大众的思想情绪打成一片。”我又听见：“要与群众打成一片，就得下决心。经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”
    这一些指示深深刻印在我的脑里。是的，不熟悉的，我们应该去熟悉，没有了解的，就要去了解。除非对人民的事业毫无热情，除非对人民和他的先锋队的战斗和胜利永远抱着冷眼旁观的态度，我们见到了祖国的光明，见到了劳动人民的高贵品质，就得热情地去歌颂，一切困难都应该克服，也必能克服。一切纠缠在大小资产阶级的思想意识的根盘上的腐烂的东西，都应该斫断。新的生命不能从这样旧的腐朽的根上发芽，新中国的人民文艺不能在这上面生长。必须从一个阶级移到另一个阶级，必须把自己的思想感情改造一下。纵然是长期的痛苦的磨练，也须要像许多开路的新中国文艺工作者一样，一步一步地经历过来。
    要变化，要改造，我该沉下心来，好好地检查一下自己的思想意识，究竟有多少是人民大众的，多少是非人民的。一套套的超阶级的善恶是非的观念，若隐若现地深深扎在我以往的作品里，有的甚至还很猖狂地叫嚣起来。我好说我痛恨黑暗的旧社会，不满意人压榨人的血腥事实，也说必须推翻封建势力、官僚买办的万恶统治，可是我却是一个超阶级的人性论者，我相信在那样的阶级社会里，人性也是普遍的善良的。我从未明确意识到每个人都有自己的阶级性。我没有明了客观决定主观，存在决定意识，阶级斗争和民族斗争的客观现实决定我们的思想情感。
    我明白我的精神领域里原来并不止于贫乏，那是一个好听的名辞，一个旧知识分子在躲闪无路时找到的一个遮丑的遁辞。实际上，在我的思想意识里，并非是如以往自命的那样进步，那样一心追求着真理和光明。我的仓库里有一大堆不见阳光的破铜烂铁，一堆发了霉味的朽木。如果不老老实实地学习马克思列宁主义，不把自己的思想根据毛泽东思想来加以彻底的清算，这些腐朽的东西还是放在那里。
    一个出身于小资产阶级、没有经过彻底改造的知识分子，很难忘怀于自己多少年来眷恋的人物、思想和情感，像蚂蚁绕树，转来转去，总离不开那样一块黑乌乌的地方。我记得在反动统治时期，在特务如麻的重庆，第一次读了“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，我仿佛立刻就明白了文艺当然是为工农兵。这还有问题吗？但是读到什么是人民大众，文艺为什么人的时候，我发现也可以为小资产阶级写，便又窃自心喜，觉得我所熟悉的那一类生活和人物还可以用得上去。只要能用马克思列宁主义的观点就成了。当时我虽然读了一两本社会科学书籍，却实在不能体会马克思列宁主义是怎么回事。现在才觉察了，这是小资产阶级意识在钻空子。真正掌握马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，那不是容易的事情。“我们夫妇之间”的作者站在小资产阶级的立场，写革命的干部，结果歪曲了革命干部的形象。这是一个教训。
    十年以前，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”说：“小资产阶级出身的人们总是经过种种方法，也经过文学艺术的方法，顽强地表现他们自己，宣传他们自己的主张，要求人们按照小资产阶级知识分子的面貌来改造党，改造世界。在这种情形下，我们的工作，就是要向他们大喝一声，说：‘同志’们，你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级和人民大众是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国亡头的危险。”
    我们伟大的领袖是这样有力地指示过的。
    记起童年时代在私塾里作文写一些“大禹惜寸阴”之类的东西，小学生写了一些类似平时如何不用心读书的缺点，末了总要写上两句“往者已矣，来者可追”的话，但从此也就忘了这两句话。现在想起来，“往者已矣”如果只指时间，那确是已经消逝了的。但“往者”应该是指自己的缺点，对于像我这样出身小资产阶级的人说来，这缺点主要应该是指小资产阶级的坏思想，那就不能凭两句宣言就能够“已矣”的。如果不随时检查，不随时靠着党和群众的指导，不彻底解决个人与群众的关系的问题，那还是会死灰复燃，即便到了群众中去，也不能从群众中学习什么东西。
    我到过淮河，参加过土地改革，在那短促的期间，我曾犯了些错误，靠了群众的帮助，得到了及时的纠正。我还不曾写出一个字来。这使我每次想起毛主席要我们“长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”的指示，我就深深感到愧痛。
    但我是毛主席的文艺队伍中的一员，新中国劳动人民伟大的建设业绩鼓励着我们，全中国光明的前途召唤着我们。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我一定要学习得比现在更好。我自身的毛病会使我遭遇到很多困难，但我一定要逐渐把自己的思想情绪和工农兵的思想情绪打成一片。
    这是不可移的决心。
