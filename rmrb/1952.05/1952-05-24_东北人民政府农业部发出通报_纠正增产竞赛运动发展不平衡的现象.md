    The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture Issues Circular
    Correcting the Imbalance in the Development of the Increased Production Emulation Campaign
    The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Agriculture issued a circular, requiring all parts of Northeast China to thoroughly implement the patriotic increased production emulation campaign and to correct the phenomena of imbalance, lack of depth, and formalism in the emulation campaign.
    The circular stated: At present, there are more than 100 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in Northeast China that have responded to Li Shunda, Han En, and others and challenged farmers across the province and even the entire Northeast region; more than 6,000 to 7,000 mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various places have responded to them and are conducting competitions with local farmers. These mutual aid and cooperative organizations have become the core of promoting the emulation campaign in various places, launching a wide-ranging mass patriotic increased production emulation campaign. As of now, half of the field planting in the southern part of Northeast China has been completed, and cotton fields in Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces are nearing completion; about one-third of the field planting in the northern region has also been completed, and Heilongjiang Province has completed 40 percent of the field planting. Agricultural technology has also improved in the spring plowing competition. For example, in Liaoxi Province, due to the development of the patriotic increased production emulation campaign involving thousands of villages and tens of thousands of groups, the area of fertilizer application in the province exceeded the plan by 3.9 percent. Most of the mutual aid and cooperative organizations participating in the competition in various places have increased manpower and animal power for farming (one plough used one to two more horses and two to three more laborers than last year), and implemented deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, creating favorable conditions for increased production this year.
    However, the phenomenon of uneven and non-thorough development of the competition campaign in various places still exists seriously. For example, according to statistics from 31 counties and cities in Songjiang Province, among the more than 7,900 mutual aid and cooperative organizations participating in the competition, Bayan and Hulan counties account for more than 4,300; while Huachuan County only has 20 groups. Another example is Yingkou County in Liaodong Province, where only a few mutual aid teams submitted written challenge and response conditions in nearly a month, with no actual production increase plan, and production continued in the old way. Some farmers in Qiujiakanzi Village said: "The competition is just about joining in the fun at the meeting." In some areas, the purpose of carrying out the patriotic increased production competition and increasing the yield per unit area is not clearly understood, pursuing huge competition plans and listing many items, such as pig raising, chicken raising, yellow wax making, rickshaw pulling, afforestation, culture, and hygiene, blurring the competition goals.
    The instructions pointed out that spring plowing has now entered a tense stage, and all localities must further thoroughly check and supervise, seize the leadership of the spring plowing competition, overcome some phenomena of being satisfied with superficial challenges and responses, strengthen patriotic education, publicize production policies, and further mobilize the enthusiasm for increased production, closely focusing on the central link of increasing the yield per unit area, so that the spring plowing patriotic increased production competition can be further widely and deeply carried out. At the same time, all localities should immediately closely combine the leadership of the spring plowing competition, carefully prepare for the spring plowing evaluation work, and when the spring plowing is near completion, conduct a thorough inspection by the masses, do a good job in the spring plowing evaluation summary, and promptly launch the summer hoeing competition.

    东北人民政府农业部发出通报
    纠正增产竞赛运动发展不平衡的现象
    东北人民政府农业部发出通报，要求东北各地深入贯彻爱国增产竞赛运动，纠正竞赛运动的不平衡、不深入和形式主义现象。
    通报内称：目前东北各省向李顺达、韩恩等应战并向全省以至东北全区农民挑战的互助组和农业生产合作社有一百多个；各地向他们应战而又和当地农民进行竞赛的互助合作组织已有六、七千个以上。这些互助合作组织已成为推动各地竞赛运动的核心，展开了广泛的群众性的爱国增产竞赛运动。截至目前为止，东北南部地区大田已种完半数，辽东、辽西两省的棉田已接近种完；北部地区大田播种亦已完成三分之一左右，黑龙江省已种完大田百分之四十。在春耕竞赛中，农业技术也有了提高。如辽西省由于开展千村万组的爱国增产竞赛运动，全省上粪面积超过计划百分之三点九。各地参加竞赛的互助合作组织，大多数都增加了种地的人力、畜力（一副犁杖比去年多用一——二匹马、二——三个劳动力），实行了深耕细作，给今年增产创造了有利条件。
    但各地竞赛运动发展不平衡不深入的现象，仍然严重存在。如据松江省三十一县市统计，参加竞赛的七千九百多个互助合作组织中，巴彦、呼兰两县就占了四千三百多个；而桦川县才只有二十个小组。又如辽东省营口县在近一个月中，仅有少数互助组提出了书面的挑战应战条件，实际没有增产计划，生产仍照老一套进行。邱家坎子村有的农民说：“竞赛是在会上凑凑热闹就行了。”还有些地区对开展爱国增产竞赛，提高单位面积产量的目的认识不明确，追逐庞大的竞赛计划，罗列很多项目，如养猪、养鸡、制黄腊、拉脚、造林、文化、卫生等样样俱全，模糊了竞赛目标。
    指示指出目前春耕已进入紧张阶段，各地必须进一步深入地检查督促，抓紧春耕竞赛的领导，克服某些满足于表面挑战应战的现象，加强爱国主义教育，宣传生产政策，进一步把增产竞赛的积极性发动起来，紧紧围绕提高单位面积产量的中心环节，使春耕爱国增产竞赛进一步广泛深入地开展起来。同时各地应即紧密结合领导春耕竞赛，认真准备春耕评比工作，在春耕近于结束时，通过群众的深入检查，做好春耕评比总结，及时开展夏锄竞赛。
