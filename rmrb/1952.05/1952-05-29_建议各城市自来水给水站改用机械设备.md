    Suggestion that water supply stations in all cities switch to mechanical equipment

    Comrade Editor: Water supply companies in various cities mostly use a water ticket system to sell water at their water supply stations. Water users first purchase water tickets and then go to the water supply station to collect water. Each water supply station has a dedicated person to manage it and opens at set times. This method is very inconvenient for residents. Often, when water is needed, the water supply station has already locked its doors. Sometimes, due to discrepancies in the size of water buckets, a reasonable amount of water cannot be obtained. Therefore, I suggest that each water supply station install appropriate machinery to automatically close the water valve. Residents can first purchase a water release key from the water company, and when they need water, they can insert the key into the water valve at the water supply station, and the water valve will automatically release water. This will not only save manpower but also be more convenient for users.

    建议各城市自来水给水站改用机械设备
    编辑同志：各城市自来水公司的给水站卖水，多半采用出售水票制度。用水者先购买水票，然后到给水站去取水；各给水站都设有专人看管，定时开放。这种办法，居民大感不便，往往需要水的时候，给水站已经把门锁起来了，有时更因水桶的悬殊，而得不到合理的水量。为此，我建议各给水站按装一适当机械，使水门自动关闭，居民可先到自来水公司购买放水钥匙，用水时，再到给水站把钥匙投入水门，水门自动放水。这样，不但能节省人力，而且用户也很方便。王修文
