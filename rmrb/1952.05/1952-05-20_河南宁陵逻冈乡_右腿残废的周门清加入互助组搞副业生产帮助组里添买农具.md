    Henan Ningling Luogang Township
    Zhou Menqing, a Crippled Man from Luogang Township, Ningling, Henan, with a Disabled Right Leg, Joins a Mutual Aid Group to Engage in Sideline Production, Helping the Group Acquire Farm Tools
    Editor: In our Luogang Township, Ningling, Henan, there is a cripple named Zhou Menqing, who is fifty-two years old this year. Before Liberation, there was a drought one year, and the grain he harvested was only enough for the rent of the landlord Li Jingren. He had to go out to do business to earn a living. Once, he pushed a cart of sorghum back from Taikang County, and his foot was chafed on the road. However, Li Jingren still forced him to carry manure, which caused dirt to enter the wound and cripple his right leg. For the next seven or eight years, he and his wife and son completely relied on singing and begging for a living. The winter before last, the township implemented land reform, and Zhou Menqing's family of six received fifteen mu of land, a donkey, and four hundred and eighty jin of sorghum. Zhou Menqing happily said to the portrait of Chairman Mao: "If it weren't for you, old man, my family would not be able to survive." However, having land also brought difficulties. Zhou Menqing's right leg was crippled, his wife had eye problems, and the oldest child was only eleven years old. None of the six family members could participate in field labor. He had no choice but to rent out the land, and the grain he received this way was not enough to eat, and he had to go hungry for four months of the year. This spring, the people's government called for production mutual aid, and the township organized nineteen mutual aid groups. Zhou Menqing asked to join, but all the groups disliked his lack of labor and did not welcome him. Later, with the help of cadres, he was reluctantly admitted into the Liu Guangyu mutual aid group. Although Zhou Menqing could not work in the fields, he had learned to grind oil when he was young, so the group raised funds to let him grind oil. His land was mutually cultivated by the group, and work points were calculated. From February to April this year, the oil Zhou Menqing ground has already earned more than 6.7 million yuan, adding a lot of farm tools and seeds to the group.
    This fact makes me realize that Zhou Menqing, who is crippled in his right leg, can only survive in a society led by the Communist Party, and only by participating in mutual aid production can he have a future. But I also feel that some mutual aid groups in the township are wrong to simply hold the view of "whoever has labor, livestock, and farm tools should be helped." The emancipated peasants should help each other with love and learn from each other's strengths.　Zhai Su

    河南宁陵逻冈乡
    右腿残废的周门清加入互助组搞副业生产帮助组里添买农具
    编辑同志：我们河南宁陵逻冈乡有个周瘸子，名叫周门清，今年五十二岁。解放前有一年，这里天旱，他收的粮食少，只够地主李敬仁的租子，他只得出门做生意赚钱过活。有一次他从太康县推一车高粱回来，路上磨破了脚，可是李敬仁还逼他去挑粪，以致脏物浸入伤口，把右腿弄残废了。这之后七、八年间，他和妻子、儿子完全依靠叫唱讨吃生活。前年冬天，乡里实行土地改革，周瘸子一家六口分得了十五亩地、一头驴和四百八十斤高粱。周瘸子对着毛主席像高兴地说：“不是您老人家搭救，我一家就活不了。”但是，分了地，还是有困难。周瘸子右腿残废，妻子的眼睛有病，最大的孩子才十一岁，一家六口都不能参加地里劳动。他没法，只得把地出租，这样收的粮食就不够吃了，一年中有四个月得挨饿。今年春天人民政府号召生产互助，乡里组织了十九个互助组。周瘸子要求参加，但各组都嫌他缺少劳动力，不欢迎他。后来在干部帮助下，他勉强被刘广玉互助组吸收入了组。周瘸子虽不能下地劳动，但他小时学过磨油，组里就集资让他磨油，他的地则由组里互助耕种，计工评分。从今年二月到四月，周瘸子磨出的油，已经赚了六十七万多元，给组里添了不少农具、种籽。
    通过这一事实，使我认识到：右腿残废的周瘸子只有在共产党领导的社会里才能生存，并且只有参加互助生产才有前途。但我也感到乡里有些互助组单纯抱着“谁有劳力、牲畜、农具，就跟谁互助”的观点是不对的。翻身农民应当互助友爱，取长补短。　翟苏
