Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The "General Treaty" between the US, British, and French imperialists and the Bonn puppet government, aimed at further driving the German people toward war, has been signed despite the strong opposition of the German people and the people of the world. The warmongers attempt to view this action as a major step in their war-mongering enterprise, but in the face of the German people's great anger and hatred, they appear so fearful, so panicked, so isolated and insignificant.

　　May 26 was the day this "General Treaty" was signed. According to Adenauer and his masters' propaganda, this day was when West Germany regained "sovereignty" and "independence," a day that the West German people should celebrate. However, even the traitors themselves dared not believe such nonsense. They spent this terrible day with fear and trepidation. Fearing the powerful demonstrations of the West German people, Adenauer even mobilized 25,500 fully armed police officers from North Rhine-Westphalia to Bonn before the signing ceremony. They densely guarded Adenauer's Chancellery and the "Bundestag Building" where the "General Treaty" was signed, strictly prohibiting passage. At the same time, police motorcycle units equipped with machine guns and other automatic weapons patrolled the streets non-stop, and traffic around the city of Bonn was cut off, strictly prohibiting passage. The entire city of Bonn was completely transformed into a military fortress. In other cities in West Germany, the police entered a state of alert as if facing a formidable enemy. The West German police authorities even specially produced a "new secret weapon" - a "large four-barreled water cannon" that could spray water columns to knock down people 225 feet away, in preparation for dealing with patriotic demonstrations.

　　Only under such severe precautions did Adenauer and his masters dare to sign their shameful names on that treaty cursed by all. All kinds of "celebrations" they had originally planned were carried out listlessly. Fearing the indignation of the people, even the reactionary leaders of the Social Democratic Party refused to participate in any programs related to the signing of this traitorous treaty. All state governments in West Germany, except for two, refused to obey the order of Bonn's Interior Minister to raise flags in all government agencies and to have all schools take a holiday to celebrate. The Bonn members of parliament who were invited to attend the treaty signing celebration actually refused Adenauer's invitation, and even many ministers of the Adenauer government refused to attend. This warmonger's "holiday" was so miserable that even United Press reporter Grigg felt greatly disappointed. In a telegram sent from Bonn on this day, Grigg lamented: "This day should have been a day of national rejoicing, but it is not." "West Germany has no joy."

　　The West German people are not merely resisting the "General Treaty" with silence; the American occupation forces and the Bonn armed police cannot suppress their anger. On the eve of the signing of the "General Treaty," the West German working people began a tense struggle. Dortmund held a demonstration of 80,000 people; Essen held a protest rally of 10,000 people; Hamburg, Stuttgart, Elberfeld, Barmen, Regensburg, Hanover, and many other places held protest demonstrations and strikes. On the day this traitorous treaty was signed, the struggle reached a new climax: Munich held the largest protest rally since the war, with 150,000 workers from Munich and southern Bavaria participating. 80,000 workers in Nuremberg held a large demonstration, and delegations from nearby industrial cities came to participate. Gelsenkirchen also held a mass rally of 40,000 people, resolutely opposing the traitorous "General Treaty" and demanding the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany in accordance with the Soviet Union's proposal. Now, the working people of the entire West Germany have expressed their determination to oppose the "General Treaty" to the end, and more demonstrations and larger protest movements are on the way.

    西德人民游行示威反对签订“一般性条约”
    阿登纳卖国政府惊慌万状景况凄惨
    【新华社二十八日讯】美、英、法帝国主义与波恩傀儡政府间为进一步驱使德国人民走向战争而缔结的“一般性条约”，已经冒着德国和全世界人民的强烈反对而签字了。战争贩子们企图把这一行动看成他们制造战争的事业上一个重大的步骤，但是，在西德人民伟大的愤怒与仇恨面前，他们却显得那么恐惧而惊慌，那么孤立而渺小。　
  五月二十六日是这个“一般性条约”签字的日子。按照阿登纳与其主子的宣传，这一天是西德重获“主权”与“独立”的日子，是西德人民应该庆祝的日子；但是，甚至卖国贼们自己都不敢相信这种鬼话，他们是提心吊胆，惶惶地度过了这可怖的一天。因为害怕西德人民的强大示威，阿登纳在签字仪式举行前，竟从北来因—威斯特伐利亚州调集了二万五千五百名全副武装的警察到波恩来。他们在阿登纳的总理府以及“一般性条约”在那里签字的“联邦议会大厦”周围密布岗哨，严禁通行。同时，装备着机关枪以及其他自动火器的警察摩托部队在街道上巡逻不停，波恩城四周也断绝交通，严禁通行。整个波恩城完全成为一座军事堡垒。在西德其他各城市，警察都如临大敌地进入戒备状态。西德警察当局甚至还特地拿出了一种“新式秘密武器”——能喷水柱把二百二十五英尺以外的人冲倒的“大型四口水炮”，准备对付举行爱国示威的人民。
    只是在这样严重的戒备之下，阿登纳和他的主子们才敢在那个为万众咒诅的条约上签下了自己可耻的名字。他们原来计划要举行的各种“庆祝”全搞得没精打采。由于害怕激愤的民气，连社会民主党的反动头子们都拒绝参加有关签订这个卖国条约的
    一切节目。西德全境的州政府，除了两个州以外，都拒绝服从波恩内政部长勒令各政府机关一律悬旗、各学校一律放假志庆的命令。被邀参加条约签字庆祝会的波恩国会议员，竟全体拒绝了阿登纳的邀请，甚至阿登纳政府的许多部长都拒绝到会。这个战争贩子的“节日”是过得这样凄惨，以至连美国合众社的记者葛利格也感到大为扫兴。葛利格在这天从波恩发出的电讯中慨叹道：“这一天本来应该是举国腾欢的日子，然而它并不是。”“西德一丝欢乐也没有。”
    西德人民并不仅仅是以沉默来抵制“一般性条约”，美国占领军与波恩武装警察也压服不了他们的愤怒。在“一般性条约”签字前夕，西德劳动人民就开始了紧张的斗争。多特蒙德举行了八万人的示威游行；埃森举行了一万人的抗议大会；汉堡、斯图加特、艾尔伯非尔德、巴尔门、累根斯堡、汉诺威以及其他许许多多地方，都举行了抗议示威和罢工。到这个卖国条约签订的这一天，斗争更达到了新的高潮：慕尼黑举行了战后以来规模最大的一次抗议大会，参加者有慕尼黑和巴伐利亚州南部工人十五万人。纽伦堡八万工人举行大示威，附近各工业城市都派代表团前来参加。盖尔森基亨也举行了四万人的群众大会，坚决反对卖国的“一般性条约”，要求按照苏联的建议从速缔结对德和约。现在，全西德的劳动人民已经表示了反对“一般性条约”到底的决心，更多的示威游行，更大的抗议运动正在到来。
