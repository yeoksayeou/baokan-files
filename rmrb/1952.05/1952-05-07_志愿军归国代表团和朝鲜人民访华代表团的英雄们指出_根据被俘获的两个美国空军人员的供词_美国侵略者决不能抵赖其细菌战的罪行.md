    Heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China Point Out:
    Based on the Confessions of Two Captured U.S. Air Force Personnel, the U.S. Aggressors Can Never Deny Their Crime of Germ Warfare
    The heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China expressed great indignation at the heinous crimes of the U.S. military in carrying out germ warfare in Korea, as confessed by two U.S. Air Force personnel captured by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    The heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation unanimously pointed out: Acheson has often clamored that the United States has not conducted and is not prepared to conduct germ warfare, and that the propaganda about germ warfare is an "accusation." Now, U.S. Air Force navigator Enoch and pilot Quinn, captured by our Volunteer Army, have confessed to the undeniable fact that the U.S. government is systematically carrying out germ warfare, and the U.S. government's shameless denial has completely gone bankrupt. Combat Hero Mao Zhangmiao said: "People have clearly seen the fact that the U.S. invading army is conducting germ warfare. The evidence is irrefutable, and it still attempts to quibble, but the confessions of the two captured U.S. Air Force personnel thoroughly exposed the hideous and ferocious face of U.S. imperialism, which can no longer be concealed." Yan Chengen, representative of the Tiande Mountain Hero Company, said: "After reading the confessions of the two U.S. Air Force personnel captured by our Volunteer Army, I was even more aroused my hatred for the enemy. This time, during my visits to various places, I saw the determination of the people of the motherland to fight against germ warfare, and I believe that our people will be able to completely crush the germ warfare of the U.S. aggressors." Yu Xiangui, a model medical worker, said: "As a medical worker, after returning to Korea, I am determined to stand at the forefront of the fight against germ warfare and work with my comrades to extinguish the poisonous flames of germ warfare."
    The heroes of the Korean People's Army in the Korean People's Delegation to China protested one after another, saying: "The statement issued by our Foreign Minister Park Heon-young on February 22 this year, based on the accurate materials obtained at the time, accused the U.S. invading army of spreading a large number of poisonous insects in the rear of the Korean front line since January 28 this year. According to the confessions of these two U.S. Air Force personnel, the U.S. aggressors had already begun germ warfare as early as January 1st. No matter what shameless means the murderers of germ warfare use, they cannot cover up their heinous crimes." Nam Man-soo, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: "According to the confessions of the two captured U.S. Air Force personnel and the materials recently published in the newspapers, people have a clearer understanding of the criminal acts of the U.S. aggressors in launching germ warfare. The confessions of these two U.S. Air Force personnel make the people of Korea and China even more hate the enemy." Kim Doo-chil, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: "During my visit to various parts of China, I saw the Chinese people actively fighting against germ warfare, which made me believe that the germ warfare carried out by U.S. imperialism will definitely fail. I personally witnessed the evidence of the U.S. military conducting germ warfare in Northeast China and visited the exhibition of the crimes of U.S. imperialism in germ warfare. Now I have seen the confessions of the two U.S. Air Force personnel published in the newspapers. These are ironclad evidence, and the U.S. government cannot deny it."
    In their angry protests, the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China unanimously pointed out that the day for judging the crimes of U.S. germ warfare is approaching. They also expressed that after returning to the Korean front, they will fight the U.S. aggressors with more courageous combat.

    志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的英雄们指出
    根据被俘获的两个美国空军人员的供词
    美国侵略者决不能抵赖其细菌战的罪行
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的英雄们，对中国人民志愿军俘获的两名美国空军人员所供认侵朝美军进行细菌战的万恶罪行，表示极大的愤怒。
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团的英雄们一致指出：艾奇逊时常叫嚣，美国没有进行也没有准备进行细菌战，对细菌战的宣传乃是一种“指责”。现在，被我志愿军俘获的美国空军领航员伊纳克和驾驶员奎恩，已供认出美国政府有计划地进行细菌战不可争辩的事实，美国政府的无耻抵赖已完全破产了。战斗英雄毛张苗说：“人们已清楚地看到美国侵略军进行细菌战的事实。铁证如山，它还企图狡赖，但是，被俘获的两名美国空军人员的供词，彻底揭露了美帝国主义可恶的狰狞的面目，再也掩饰不了了。”天德山英雄连代表阎成恩说：“我看到被我志愿军俘获的两名美国空军人员的供词后，更加激起了对敌人的仇恨。这次，我在各地访问，看到祖国人民反细菌战的决心，我相信我国人民一定能够彻底粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战。”模范医务工作者于宪桂说：“我是一个医务工作者，回到朝鲜后，决心站在反细菌战的最前线，和战友们一起努力扑灭细菌战的毒焰。”
    朝鲜人民访华代表团的朝鲜人民军英雄们纷纷提出抗议，他们说：“我国外务相朴宪永在今年二月二十二日所发出的声明，根据当时所得的确实材料，指控美国侵略军从今年一月二十八日起在朝鲜前线后方撒布大量毒虫。而根据这两个美国空军人员的供词，美国侵略者早在一月一日就已开始进行细菌战了。细菌战的凶手们用任何无耻的手段也掩盖不住它们的滔天罪行。”朝鲜人民共和国英雄南万寿说：“根据被俘获的两名美国空军人员的供词以及近来报纸上所公布的材料，人们更加认清了美国侵略者发动细菌战的罪恶行为。这两名美国空军人员的供词，使我们朝中人民更加仇恨敌人。”朝鲜人民共和国英雄金斗七说：“我在中国各地访问，看到中国人民积极反细菌战的情况，使我相信美帝国主义进行的细菌战一定要失败。我在中国东北亲眼看到美军进行细菌战的罪证，参观了美帝国主义细菌战罪行展览会，现在又看到报纸上公布的两个美国空军人员的供词。这些都是铁的证据，美国政府是抵赖不了的。”
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的英雄们在愤怒的抗议中一致指出，裁判美国细菌战罪行的日子临近了。他们并表示在回到朝鲜前线后，一定要以更勇敢的战斗，打击美国侵略军。
