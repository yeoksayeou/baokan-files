    It is wrong for Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau to reduce newspaper subscriptions

    Editor: Our Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau used to subscribe to the People's Daily for the workers. By studying the People's Daily, our political understanding has improved a step further. However, after the "Three-Anti" movement, the leadership, in order to save money, only subscribed to one copy of the People's Daily for the cadres to read, and our workers could not see it. We have raised our opinions to the higher authorities about this, but it has not been resolved. I believe that streamlining and economizing cannot be without principles. Newspapers, especially the People's Daily, should not be economized on.

    Industrial Labor Model    Sun Xiaoju

    Editor's Note: The opinion raised by Labor Model Sun Xiaoju is correct. The Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau and other enterprises with similar situations should immediately find ways to correct this deviation.

    齐齐哈尔铁路分局减订报纸是不对的
    编辑同志：我们齐齐哈尔铁路分局，在过去曾给工人订有人民日报。由于学习人民日报，我们的政治认识都提高了一步。但在“三反”运动后，领导方面为了节约，只订了一份人民日报给干部看，我们工人就看不到了。我们为此曾向上级提意见，也没有得到解决。我认为精简节约不能是无原则的。对报纸，尤其是人民日报，是不应该节约的。

    编者按：劳动模范孙孝菊提的意见是正确的。齐齐哈尔铁路分局以及其他有类似情况的企业单位，应立即设法纠正这种偏向。
