    Overcome Departmentalism and Rationally Utilize Specialized Talent

    The six comrades, including Dong Zhenyu, have put forward many important opinions on the issue of using cadres. These opinions should attract the attention of the relevant leading organs, and appropriate measures should be taken to resolve them as quickly as possible.

    Before the national liberation, due to the needs of the people's revolutionary war, we had to place some economic construction talents in other work positions. The phenomenon of "what is learned is not what is used" was difficult to avoid, and therefore also permissible. However, now that the Chinese revolution has achieved national victory, and the nation's economic construction, especially industrial construction, is about to begin on a large scale, we have absolutely no need to use economic construction talents for other work. Instead, we should mobilize a large number of cadres to study and participate in economic construction, especially industrial construction. At this time, if we still allow college students majoring in engineering to do clerical work or handle mail, that is an impermissible waste of talent. From a national perspective, due to various reasons (many of which are unreasonable phenomena left over from the Kuomintang era), there are still a large number of college students majoring in engineering and other specialized talents who remain in other work positions, doing work that is not suitable for them and that they are unwilling to do. This is a loss for our country, which currently lacks industrial talent and other specialized talent, and this situation must be changed immediately.

    In order to quickly and effectively change this situation and gather and use specialized talents for specialized construction undertakings, the departmentalism of some regions and units that lack overall awareness and disregard the overall situation must be resolutely corrected. The part must obey the whole, and small interests must obey large interests. This is our principle, and all heads of agencies and leading cadres should implement it unconditionally. Even if the transfer of specialized talent causes a small temporary impact on the work of the unit or some small difficulties, other methods should be used to solve it, and this general principle cannot be violated.

    Personnel with specialized knowledge and skills, if they believe that they are suitable for certain specialized work, can submit their opinions to the leaders of their own agencies without hesitation, and even up to higher leading organs. The leaders of their own agencies should not use some specious reasoning to obstruct them, blame, or criticize them. If this happens, the higher-level leading organs should criticize and correct such errors.

    The organization and personnel departments of leading organs at all levels should investigate this phenomenon of irrational use of cadres and accurately register all college students majoring in engineering and other specialized talents who are being irrationally used. They should also explain to the leaders of the relevant agencies the great significance of the rational use of specialized talent in the current national construction, so that they can broaden their horizons, take care of the overall situation, and transfer specialized talent to appropriate work positions. If there are special difficulties that prevent the immediate transfer of the above-mentioned cadres, it must be approved by a certain organization.

### 克服本位主义思想，合理地使用专门人才

    克服本位主义思想，合理地使用专门人才
    董振玉等六位同志对于使用干部的问题，提出了许多重要的意见。这些意见，应该引起有关领导机关的注意，并采取适当的办法尽速解决。
    全国解放以前，由于人民革命战争的需要，我们曾不得不把若干经济建设人材安置在其他工作岗位上，“所学非所用”的现象是难于避免的，因而也是可以容许的。但是，在中国革命已经取得全国胜利，国家经济建设尤其是工业建设将要大规模开始的今天，我们已经完全没有必要再把经济建设人才用于其他工作，而是应该调集大量的干部去学习和参加经济建设尤其是工业建设。在这种时候，如果还让学工的大学生去做文书、收发之类的事务，那就是一种不能容许的浪费人才的错误了。从全国看，由于各种原因（有许多是国民党时代所遗留的不合理现象），现在还有很大数量学工的大学生和其他专门人才留在其他工作岗位，做着不适于他们做而他们也不愿意做的工作。这对于工业人才和其他专门人才目前都十分缺乏的我国，是一种损失，这种状况是必须立即加以改变的。
    为了迅速地有效地改变这种状况，把专门人才调集、使用于专门的建设事业，若干地区和单位的不识大体、不顾大局的本位主义思想必须坚决予以纠正。局部服从全体，小利益服从大利益，这是我们的原则，任何机关首长和领导干部都应该无条件地执行。即令因为专门人才的调动，使本单位的工作暂时受点小的影响，遭受某些小的困难，也应该用别的办法来解决，不能违反这一总的原则。
    有专门知识和技术的人员，如果自己认为自己适于做某种专门的工作，可以无顾虑地向本机关领导人提出自己的意见，以至一直提到更高的领导机关。本机关的领导人不应该用一些似是而非的道理来阻挠他们，责备和非难他们。如果有这种情形，上级领导机关应该进行批评，纠正这样的错误。
    各级领导机关的组织部门和人事部门，应该对这种不合理地使用干部的现象进行调查，据实登记所有被不合理地使用着的学工的大学生和其他的专门人才。并对有关机关的领导人说明合理使用专门人才在目前国家建设中的重大意义，使他们能放大眼光，照顾大局，把专门人才输送到适当的工作岗位上去。如果有特殊困难不能马上调出上述干部的，须经一定的组织批准。
