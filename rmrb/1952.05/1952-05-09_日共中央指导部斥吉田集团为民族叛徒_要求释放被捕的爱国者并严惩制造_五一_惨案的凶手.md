　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 8th: TASS Tokyo, June 6th: The "Akahata," which resumed publication on May 1st, published a special edition containing a letter from the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party to Japanese workers and people. The letter stated: "The major event of May Day is the national liberation struggle, an outburst of national discontent caused by the 'peace treaty', 'security treaty', and seven years of occupation policies signed in San Francisco. The workers who died were patriots who loved their country. The Yoshida government, Tokyo Police Chief Tanaka, and the police who opened fire are all national traitors. The act of turning Japan into an American military base and colony, and the accompanying intensified exploitation of the Japanese people, will inevitably further sharpen the national liberation struggle. The Yoshida government must be held responsible for all of this. The Communist Party demands the immediate resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet, the immediate dismissal of Tokyo Police Chief, the arrest of all police officers who shot at the people, and their submission to a people's court for trial." The Central Committee of the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association Federation issued an appeal demanding the dismissal of Justice Minister Kimura, National Police Agency Director Saito, and Tokyo Police Chief Tanaka as direct perpetrators, the immediate release of those arrested, and called on students nationwide to strike in protest against the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill."
　　According to the "World Times," demonstrators arrived in an organized manner in front of the Imperial Palace plaza and were applauded by passers-by. There were women and children among the demonstrators. The girls danced peacefully, singing "May Day" songs. When the police suddenly attacked the demonstrators, the first to die was a girl who fell with a facial injury. A "World Times" reporter believes that the police authorities acted according to a pre-arranged plan from the beginning, throwing tear gas at the demonstrators and opening fire. After dispersing the demonstrators, the police continued to shoot at people standing at the tram station, even though they had nothing to do with the demonstration. The newspaper reporter pointed out that some unidentified people wearing American-style clothes threw stones at the police station. The special edition of "Akahata" stated that the person who first ordered the attack on the demonstrators came in a luxury car and said something to a police officer. The first shot fired from a revolver was by an American military policeman. According to the "May Day News" bulletin published by the trade union committee organizing the May Day celebrations, the police brutally beat women, children, and the elderly.

    日共中央指导部斥吉田集团为民族叛徒
    要求释放被捕的爱国者并严惩制造“五一”惨案的凶手
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社东京六日讯：五月一日复刊的“赤旗报”在号外中刊载日本共产党中央指导部告日本工人和人民书。该书说：“五一节的大事是民族解放斗争，是全国因在旧金山签订的‘和约’、‘安全条约’以及七年占领政策所产生的不满情绪的爆发。死难的工人是热爱祖国的志士。吉田政府、东京警察总监田中和开枪射击的警察都是民族的叛徒。把日本变成美国军事基地和殖民地的行为以及随之而来的加重剥削日本人民的行为，势必使民族解放斗争进一步尖锐化。吉田政府应对这一切负责。共产党要求吉田内阁立即辞职，要求将东京警察总监立即革职，要求逮捕所有开枪射击人民的警察并把他们交付人民法庭审判。”全日本学生自治会联合会中央委员会发表呼吁书，要求把法务总裁木村、国警本部长官斋藤和东京警察总监田中作为直接凶犯予以革职，立即释放被捕者，并号召全国学生总罢课以抗议“防止破坏活动法案”。
    据“世界时报”报道，游行者有组织地到达皇宫前广场，并受到路人鼓掌欢迎。游行者中间有妇女和儿童。女孩子们和平地舞蹈着，唱着“五一”歌曲。当警察突然向游行者袭击时，首先牺牲的是一个女孩子，脸部受伤倒了下去。“世界时报”记者认为：警察当局一开始就按照事先拟定的计划行动。向游行群众投掷催泪弹，并开枪射击。在驱散游行群众后，警察仍继续射击站在电车站的人，虽然他们是和游行毫无关系的。该报记者指出：曾有某些身穿美式衣服的来路不明的人向警察局投掷石块。“赤旗报”的号外说：首先下令向游行者进攻的那个人，是坐着豪华的汽车来的，他曾向一个警官讲了些什么。用左轮枪开第一枪的是一个美国宪兵。据组织庆祝“五一”的工会委员会所出版的“五一新闻”通报报道，警察曾毒打妇女、儿童和老人。
