Reader's Letters

To the Editor: We are the representatives elected by the workers of Pushan Printing Factory. The former manager of our factory, Xu Xunqing, was a counter-revolutionary and was dealt with by the government according to the law in May of last year. Because the factory had no capitalist responsible person to preside over operations at the time, the workers elected a democratic management committee to temporarily lead the business. On December 12th of last year, the Beijing Municipal Court formally ruled that the factory was the property of a counter-revolutionary. Due to debt relations, the Bank of Communications Enterprise Management Section took over on behalf of the government. After the Bank of Communications sent people to inventory the assets, they have not yet sent an administrative person in charge to manage the factory. The Bank of Communications负责人 said: "We only take over the property and are not responsible for business operations." Therefore, they do not care about the operations of our factory. The workers reflect that our factory is neither public nor private, and no one cares. Our factory has difficulties in business relations with other departments: if treated as publicly owned, the nature of the enterprise is not determined; if treated as privately owned, a contract and security deposit are required. The Bank of Communications does not provide security or letters of certification. The Bank of Communications' long-term inappropriate handling of the production and wage issues of our factory is, we believe, very wrong. We hope that relevant departments will deal with this promptly.

    交通银行应迅速解决普善印刷厂的领导问题编辑同志：我们是普善印刷工厂工人选举的代表。我厂前经理徐勋卿是一个反革命分子，已在去年五月被政府法办。因当时工厂无资方负责人主持，就由工人选出民主管理委员会暂时领导业务。去年十二月十二日，北京市法院正式判决这个工厂为反革命分子的财产，因债务关系，由交通银行企业管理科代政府接管。交通银行派人清点资产后，到今天还没有派行政负责人来管理。交通银行负责人说：“我们只接收财产，不负业务责任。”因此，他们就不管我厂的业务。工人反映，我厂是不公、不私，没人管。我厂在和其他部门发生业务关系时有困难：按公营处理，没有确定企业性质；按私营处理，需立合同打铺保。交通银行不管打保，也不出证明信。交通银行长期不适当地处理我厂的生产和工资问题，我们认为这是很不对的。希望有关部门迅速予以处理。
