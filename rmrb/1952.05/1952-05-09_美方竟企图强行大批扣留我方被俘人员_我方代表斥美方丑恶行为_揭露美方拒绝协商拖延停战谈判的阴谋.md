Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. At the Korean Armistice Talks delegation meeting on the 8th, our representative strongly condemned the other side for completely destroying the Geneva Convention and all international law, using violence and massacre to conduct so-called "screening" among our captured personnel, attempting to detain a large number of our captured personnel. On the issue of prisoners of war, our side has already made significant concessions, proposing reasonable compromise repatriation principles and adjustment plans. Our side has also proposed a reasonable compromise comprehensive plan on all unresolved issues. However, the other side has not only failed to make the slightest concession on the prisoner of war issue, but has instead overturned its own clear expressions, and has even adopted an attitude of refusing to negotiate and refusing to reason in the meetings, clearly attempting to delay the armistice talks. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, made the following main statement:

"I reiterate that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army resolutely reject your proposal of April 28th. Your unilateral and unreasonable demand to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel is absolutely unacceptable to our side. Our comprehensive proposal of May 2nd is the only reasonable compromise solution to resolve all unresolved issues. Our side has already made all possible concessions on the issue of prisoners of war. On March 21st and 27th, we proposed a completely reasonable compromise repatriation principle and adjustment plan. In our May 2nd proposal, we made even greater concessions on the issue of nominating neutral countries. You have no reason to continue to reject our reasonable compromise proposal of May 2nd. Your claim of so-called 'voluntary repatriation' for all our captured personnel, attempting to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel, violates all international conventions and completely destroys the clear provisions of the Geneva Convention. Everyone knows that there is no freedom whatsoever in your prisoner of war camps. The so-called 'screening' you are conducting among our captured personnel is completely absurd. The so-called 'screening' results you have presented are completely invalid. The method you have proposed of conducting on-site investigations of the so-called 'screening' results after the signing of the armistice agreement is doubly absurd. When you should clearly understand that our side fundamentally opposes your suggestion, proposing this suggestion can have no other purpose than to deceive the world. On the issue of prisoners of war, you have not made the slightest concession since December 11th of last year. Not only that, after you clearly expressed your willingness to resolve the issue within the framework of our principles of March 21st, you have regressed and put forward your unreasonable proposal on the issue of prisoners of war. This can have no other explanation than to prove that you are not concerned about the interests of your own captured personnel and that you still have no intention of reaching an armistice. Your activities of threatening and instigating our captured personnel, attempting to forcibly detain our captured personnel, are a well-known fact that requires no investigation. Your own news reports openly admit that you are using the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Li Seung-man secret service to carry out ugly acts such as forced tattooing and forced petitioning among our captured personnel. Your own news reports openly admit that you do not hesitate to resort to massacres in an attempt to force our captured personnel to accept your forced detention. The unwavering will of our captured personnel to return to their homes has been fully demonstrated in their heroic resistance to all your threats and instigations. And you have not yet made any responsible explanation for the repeated massacre cases. What qualifications do you have to present the results of your so-called screening?! What qualifications do you have to demand an investigation after the armistice of a deceptive trick that the people of the world have already seen through?! Releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war to return to their homes is a clear provision of the Geneva Convention, and it is an inescapable responsibility and obligation stipulated by all international laws. If you still intend to reach an armistice agreement, you must withdraw your unilateral and unreasonable demands on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation."

    美方竟企图强行大批扣留我方被俘人员
    我方代表斥美方丑恶行为
    揭露美方拒绝协商拖延停战谈判的阴谋
    【新华社开城八日电】八日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方代表痛斥对方彻底破坏日内瓦公约和一切国际公法，以暴行和屠杀的手段在我方被俘人员中进行所谓“甄别”，企图扣留大批我方被俘人员。我方在战俘问题上，已经作了重大的让步，提出了合理折衷的遣俘原则和调整方案，我方更在所有未决的问题上，提出了合理折衷的全面方案。而对方不但在战俘问题上始终未作丝毫的让步，反而推翻了对方自己所作的明确表示，并更在会议中采取了拒绝协商，拒绝说理的态度，显然企图拖延停战谈判。我方首席代表南日将军主要发言如下：
    “我再次指出朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军断然拒绝你方四月二十八日的方案。你方企图扣留十万以上我方被俘人员的片面无理的主张是我方所绝对不能考虑的。我方五月二日的全面方案是解决所有未决问题的唯一的合理折衷方案。我方在战俘问题上，已经作了一切可能的让步。在三月二十一日和二十七日提出了完全合理折衷的遣俘原则和调整方案。我方在五月二日方案中，更在中立国提名问题上作了重大的让步。你方没有任何理由继续拒绝我方五月二日的合理折衷方案。你方对我方被俘人员全体实行所谓‘自愿遣返’，企图扣留十万以上我方被俘人员的主张，违反了一切国际公约，彻头彻尾地破坏了日内瓦公约的明确规定。谁都知道你方战俘营中根本没有任何自由。你方在我方被俘人员中所进行的所谓‘甄别’根本是荒谬的。你方所声称的所谓‘甄别’结果是完全无效的。你方所提出的在停战协定签字后对所谓你方‘甄别’结果进行实地调查的办法是双重荒谬的。你方在应该完全清楚地了解到我方根本反对你方这种建议时，提出这种建议，除了欺骗世人以外，不可能有任何其他目的。在战俘问题上，自从去年十二月十一日以来，你方未作丝毫让步。不仅如此，在你方明白表示愿在我方三月二十一日原则轮廓内解决问题之后，反而倒退地提出你方在战俘问题上的无理方案。这除了证明你方毫不关心你方自己的被俘人员的利益，证明你方还无意于达成停战以外，不可能有任何其他的解释。你方在我方被俘人员中进行威胁策动，企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员的勾当，无须进行任何调查，已经是人所共晓的事实。你方自己的新闻报道公开承认你方利用蒋介石匪帮和使用李承晚特务在我方被俘人员中进行强迫刺字，强迫请愿等的丑恶行为。你方自己的新闻报道公开承认，你方不惜采取成批屠杀的手段，企图强使我方被俘人员接受你方的强迫扣留。我方被俘人员要求归返家园的不可动摇的意志，在他们对于你方一切的威胁策动的英勇的反抗中已经有了充分的表现。而你方对于屡次的屠杀案件至今还没有任何负责的交代。你方还有什么资格提出你方所谓甄别的结果？！你方还有什么资格要求在停战后进行调查全世界的人民已经识破了的欺骗伎俩？！释放并遣返全部战俘归返家园是日内瓦公约的明确规定，是一切国际公法所规定的、不容逃避的责任与义务。如果你方还有意达成停战协议，你方就必须撤回你方在战俘遣返问题上的片面无理的主张。”
