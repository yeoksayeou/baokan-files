    Running School Nurseries in a Revolutionary Way
    Lang Jiehua, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers Union of China
    According to current statistics, there are 209 school nurseries nationwide, caring for 2,418 children (incomplete statistics). From the perspective of the demands of female teachers nationwide, the number of nurseries is clearly insufficient. However, judging from the development of school nursery work over the past year, this development has been quite rapid.
    In regions or schools where nurseries have already been established and are run relatively well, not only has the professional work of female teachers improved significantly, but their learning requirements have also increased. Female teachers who were previously unable to participate in social activities due to having to take care of their children are now actively participating in various activities. Li Chongwei and Long Chunying, two teachers from Zhixin Girls' Middle School in Guangdong Province, said: "Before the school established a nursery, our bodies were in the classroom, but our minds were at home, constantly worrying that our children would get into trouble. After school, we were so exhausted by the children that we were dizzy and disoriented. It was impossible to study and prepare teaching materials, and it was difficult to even rest quietly. We felt tired all day long. Since the establishment of the nursery, the worry about the children causing trouble has disappeared, and we have time to study and prepare teaching materials, or to rest. As a result, it is easier to concentrate in class, and our spirit is much more full of energy when lecturing." Yin Meiqin, a female teacher at Wuchang No. 19 Elementary School, once had to get up at four o'clock in the morning to settle her children in order to attend a report. She crossed the Yangtze River four times that day to take care of her children. After the establishment of the nursery at the school, this difficulty for female teachers was resolved.
    A nursery cannot be run well by just a few people. It is necessary to rely on the strength of the masses, while striving for the attention and assistance of the administration and the support of local people's organizations such as the Democratic Women's Federation. We should not have overly high demands on nurseries. If the buildings must be magnificent, the equipment must be perfect, and well-trained nannies and experienced doctors are required, it is unrealistic, and it is impossible to achieve in some places at present.
    Wuhan City established three school nurseries in 1950, but without adequately mobilizing the masses beforehand, using revolutionary methods to solve difficulties, or establishing close ties with relevant departments. It relied solely on a few cadres from the Municipal Education Union running around raising funds. Moreover, the cadres and female teachers had excessively high demands for the nurseries. As a result, the funds were completely exhausted by the end of 1950, and the three nurseries were successively closed down. Based on the above experiences and lessons, the Wuhan Municipal Education Union realized that the reason for the failure was the excessively high demands for the nurseries and the failure to fully mobilize the masses to solve problems in a timely manner with their own strength. Therefore, after full publicity and mobilization, criticism of mothers' overly high expectations, and with the assistance of the administration, they systematically conducted pilot nursery work with Wuchang No. 19 Elementary School as the focus, under existing conditions. As a result, within three months, following No. 19 Elementary School, eighteen nurseries were established successively, based on schools as units. The experience of Wuhan City proves that running nurseries must start from the current specific situation, fully mobilize the masses, not be afraid of making do with whatever is available, and progress from nothing to something, from simple to complete. The nurseries that have already been established must establish a democratic management system. Leaders must regularly solicit and listen to opinions from all sides to improve their work. Only in this way can the nurseries be consolidated.
    Running school nurseries is extremely urgent. Whether at present or in the future, it is an important measure to solve the work difficulties of female teachers and improve their teaching effectiveness. Although there are still some difficulties under the current circumstances, as long as we pool our efforts and give play to the revolutionary spirit, school nurseries can be run well.

    用革命的办法做好学校托儿间工作
    中国教育工会全国委员会副主席  郎洁华
    根据现有的材料统计，全国共有学校托儿间二百零九处，受托的儿童有二千四百十八名（不完全的统计）。这从全国女教师的要求来讲，托儿间显然是不够的；不过就一年来学校托儿间工作的发展情况看，这种发展是相当迅速的。
    凡在已经举办托儿间而且办得较好的地区或学校，不但女教师的业务工作有了显著的提高，她们的学习要求也提高了。过去因为要照顾孩子而不能参加社会活动的女教师，都积极地参加了各种活动。广东省执信女子中学的李崇威和龙春英两位教师说：“在学校未成立托儿间以前，我们人在课堂上，心却在家里，老是提心吊胆地怕孩子出乱子。放学回家后又被孩子闹得头晕眼花，学习和准备教材固不可能，就是要安静地休息一下也很难，整日感到疲劳不堪。自托儿间成立以后，怕孩子出岔子的心事没有了，也有时间进行学习和准备教材，或者休息一下了。因此，上课时思想容易集中，讲课时精神也饱满得多了。”武昌第十九小学女教师殷美琴，有一次去听报告，不得不在早晨四点钟起床安顿孩子，为了照看孩子，在这一天接连过了四次江。而在该校成立托儿间以后，女教师的这种困难就解决了。
    托儿间不是专靠几个人便能办好的，必须依靠群众的力量，同时争取行政方面的重视和帮助以及当地人民团体如民主妇女联合会等的支持。我们对托儿间也不能有过高的要求。如果房屋要富丽、设备要完善，还要训练良好的褓姆和经验丰富的医生，那是不切合实际的，在目前有的地方还不可能办到。
    武汉市曾在一九五○年举办学校托儿间三处，但事先没有很好地发动群众，用革命的办法解决困难，也没有和有关部门取得密切的联系，只凭市教育工会几个干部东奔西跑地捐募基金，而干部和女教师们又对托儿间有过高的要求，因此到一九五○年底基金即全部用完，三个托儿间便相继停办了。武汉市教育工会根据以上的经验教训，认识到失败的原因是对托儿间的要求过高，没有充分发动群众用自己的力量来及时解决问题。于是经过充分的宣传动员，批判了母亲们要求过高的思想，在取得行政方面的帮助后，在现有的条件下，以武昌第十九小学为重点，有计划地进行了试办托儿间的工作。结果在三个月中，继第十九小学之后，以学校为单位，先后成立了十八个托儿间。武汉市的经验证明，办托儿间要从当前的具体情况出发，充分地发动群众，不怕因陋就简，要从无到有，从简陋走向完备。已经办起来的托儿间必须建立民主的管理制度，领导人要经常征求和听取各方面的意见，改进工作，只有这样，托儿间才能巩固。
    举办学校托儿间是十分迫切的，不论在目前或今后，它都是解决女教师的工作困难、提高她们的教学效能的一项重要措施。虽然在目前的情况下，还有若干困难，但只要群策群力，发扬革命的精神，学校托儿间是可以办好的。
