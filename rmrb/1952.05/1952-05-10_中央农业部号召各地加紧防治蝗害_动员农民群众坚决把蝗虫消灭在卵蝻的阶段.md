    The locust egg masses collected by the Ministry of Agriculture from Ninghe County, Hebei Province last year hatched into nymphs on May 6th. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that, based on the cyclical occurrence of locusts, it is estimated that this year will be another year of serious locust outbreaks. All regions should immediately lead the peasants to vigorously eliminate eggs and nymphs. The Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that in areas where locusts occurred last year, a large number of locust eggs have been found upon inspection, and some areas have already begun to hatch. In Hebei Province, more than 750,000 mu of land with locust eggs have been found. Among them, the Shengfang Locust Control Station west of Tianjin found more than 11,000 mu of land with locust eggs in 49 villages. In the Subei area, it is estimated that the area where locust nymphs may occur in Siyang, Guanyun, Huaiyin, and Suqian counties is more than 200,000 mu. In the Zhou Taizi and Che Lukou areas of Sihong County in northern Anhui, the density of locust eggs is very high, with an average of three to four egg masses per square foot, and up to eleven in some cases. The densest is as high as forty-nine. Calculating eighty to one hundred locust eggs per mass, there are four to five thousand locusts. Xinjiang also sent many locust control teams this spring to inspect. These teams overcame the difficulties of reed lake mud and difficult passage for people and horses, and also found many locust eggs in a vast area. The general situation in all locust areas is that the area of locust egg land is large, the density is high, and the overwintering mortality rate is very low. In addition, the warm climate last winter and the lack of rain in early spring this year have created favorable conditions for locust outbreaks. Currently, it is the locust egg hatching season. In Caijiawa, Erqu, Fushan County, Tengxian Prefecture, Shandong Province, on May 4th, a large number of locust nymphs were found on a piece of land three li long and one li wide, with a density of fifteen nymphs that could be slapped dead with one hand. Prior to this, on April 30th, locust nymphs were also found in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th districts of Minquan County, Henan Province. The locust nymph distribution area is about 300,000 mu, mostly in old river channels and wasteland. In the areas with the highest density, there are 20 to 30 nymphs per square meter. Locust nymphs were found as early as mid-April in Shengjinkou, Turpan Basin, Xinjiang Province. The situation in various places is very serious. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture believes that in addition to immediately destroying the locust eggs that have been dug out but not yet eliminated, the locust areas in North China, East China, Central South, and Northwest China should continue to strengthen the inspection of locust eggs and the reconnaissance of hopper hatching. If locust nymphs are found, peasants should be immediately mobilized to eliminate them. In some areas that have not yet made preparations for catching and beating, preparations should be stepped up immediately, and the locust situation should be closely monitored to mobilize and organize peasants in a planned and organized manner, using manual catching and beating or using pesticides and machinery at appropriate times, to resolutely eliminate locusts in the egg and nymph stages and prevent them from spreading into a disaster.

    中央农业部号召各地加紧防治蝗害
    动员农民群众坚决把蝗虫消灭在卵蝻的阶段
    中央人民政府农业部去年派员从河北省宁河县采回的蝗虫卵块已于五月六日孵化成蝻。农业部认为：根据蝗虫周期性发生的规律，估计今年蝗虫又是严重发生的一年。各地应即领导农民，大力除卵灭蝻。农业部指出：去年发生过蝗虫的地区，据检查都发现有大量的蝗卵存在，有的地区已开始孵化。河北全省查出蝗卵地七十五万多亩，其中天津以西的胜芳治蝗站，在四十九个村就查出有蝗卵的地一万一千多亩。苏北区泗阳、灌云、淮阴、宿迁四县估计可能发生蝗蝻面积有二十多万亩。皖北区泗洪县周台子、车路口一带，发现蝗卵密度很大，平均每平方尺有三块到四块，多的有十一块，最密的竟达四十九块。每块八十到一百粒蝗卵计算，即有蝗虫四、五千个。新疆今春也派出了许多扑蝗队检查，这些扑蝗队克服苇湖泥泞人马难行的困难，也在广大的地区内查出蝗卵不少。各蝗区总的情况都是蝗卵地面积大，密度稠，过冬死亡率很低。加以去冬气候温暖今年早春雨少更给蝗虫发生造成有利条件。目前已届蝗卵孵化季节，山东省滕县专区凫山县二区蔡家洼，五月四日已在长三华里宽一华里的一块地上发现了密度很大的蝗蝻，其密度一手可拍死十五个。在此以前，四月三十日河南省民权县的一、二、四、五各区也发现了蝗蝻。蝗蝻分布面积约三十万亩，多在老河道荒草地里。密度最大的地方，每平方公尺有蝻二十个到三十个。新疆省吐鲁番盆地胜金口地方，早在四月中旬就已发现了蝗蝻。各地情况都很严重。为此，农业部认为：华北、华东、中南、西北各蝗区除应将已挖出尚未消灭的蝗卵立即毁掉外，应继续加强检查蝗卵和侦察跳蝻孵化情况，如发现蝗蝻，应即发动农民扑灭。尚未作好捕打前准备工作的某些地区，应立即加紧准备，并严密掌握蝗情，做到有计划、有领导地动员和组织农民，分别用人工捕打或在适当时期使用药械，坚决把蝗虫消灭在卵蝻的阶段，不使蔓延成灾。    （新华社）
