The First Step Towards Completely Solving the Tianjin Workers' Housing Problem
—On the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Building Workers' Dormitories
　　Zhou Kang
　　In the past three years, the workers of Tianjin have created a large amount of wealth for the motherland through selfless labor. With the development of production, the lives of workers have also improved a lot. In order to solve the housing problem that Tianjin workers have been expecting for many years, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government has decided to build 50,000 rooms of workers' dormitories this year. This is the first step towards completely solving the housing problem of Tianjin workers. Among them, the first batch of 12,000 rooms officially started construction on April 19th.

　　When the decision to build workers' dormitories reached every workshop and every worker's family, everyone's excitement was indescribable. Liu Enming, a technician in the fitter group of the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory, immediately told his father when he heard the news. His father said: "I've been doing painting work since I was sixteen, just painting doors and brushing walls for others, and the nice houses were all for other people. I never thought I would live to see this day when the government builds houses for us workers. We've lived in hovels for three generations, and now we've finally made it through. We can only have such happiness under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!" During the period of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the reactionaries deprived the laborers of everything. The workers were squeezed dry, and it was impossible to get a relatively comfortable place to live. After liberation, although the lives of workers have been significantly improved, this hardship left over from the old society has not been completely resolved. For example, the state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory has only ninety-seven dormitory rooms, and only fourteen single workers and fifty-seven workers with families live in the factory out of more than six hundred and thirty workers in the factory. Among the more than three thousand and six hundred workers in the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, one thousand and eighty people live outside the factory, and the farthest ones have to walk more than thirty miles every day, which takes four hours back and forth. Some need to cross the river four times and take a ferry four times. Workers do not have suitable places to rest, which not only affects the health of workers and their families but also directly hinders production. For example, Li Jinxiu, a worker at the Tianjin Steel Plant Branch Factory, lives in Zhangguizhuang, which is twenty miles away from the factory. He goes to work at 6:00 in the morning and has to get up at 3:00, walking forty miles back and forth a day, which increases physical fatigue in vain. Therefore, workers are eager to have a better living environment. Their expectations have begun to be realized this year under the extreme care of the Communist Party and the People's Government for the welfare of workers. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government decided to build 50,000 workers' dormitory rooms this year in Zhongshanmenwai in the Fifth District, Wangchuanchang in the Fourth District, Nanbeilou in the Sixth District, and other areas, and decided to completely solve the housing problem of all workers in the city within three to five years. The engineering standard for this construction of workers' dormitories is determined based on the actual needs of the workers, striving to solve the difficulties of more people. After liberation, some state-owned factories and enterprises have begun to solve the housing problem of workers and have spent a large amount of funds. However, the engineering standard of the dormitories is not based on the actual requirements of the workers and the current actual needs but strives for "beauty" and "generosity." Therefore, a lot of money is spent, and the scope of solving the problem is very small. The state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory built a "palace-style" workers' dormitory last spring. The houses are very elegant, with corridors, heating, washrooms, ancient palace lanterns, terrazzo floors, etc. A large amount of funds were used, but there were only forty-eight rooms that could be inhabited. The Tianjin Steel Plant also built fifty "Western-style houses" the year before last, each with a bedroom, living room, toilet, and kitchen. This was originally designed for one family to live in one house; however, because there were too many workers in urgent need of housing, they had to live in one house with two or three families; thus, one family lived in the bedroom, and the other had to live in the living room or use the kitchen as a bedroom.

　　In order to avoid such extravagance, waste, and impractical tendencies, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government has repeatedly studied, carefully planned, designed ten different styles of house blueprints, and built demonstration houses, inviting workers and their families from various factories to visit and solicit their opinions. After multiple visits, discussions, and revisions, the engineering standards that the workers found satisfactory were determined. The net length of the workers' family dormitory is 4 meters, the net width is 3.35 meters, the net area is 13.4 square meters, and the net height is 2.85 meters. The net length of the single dormitory is 6 meters, the net width is 4 meters, the net area is 24 square meters, and the net height is 3.35 meters. The dormitories are equipped with glass doors and windows, the foundation is paved with coke ash, the walls are built with "two-five" solid walls, and there are electric lights and tap water and other equipment. The construction cost of each dormitory, including the cost of ancillary equipment, is more than 7.25 million yuan. Using the funds of the state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory to build forty-eight "palace-style" dormitories, renovating this kind of bungalow can build four hundred and fifty more rooms; if each room is calculated to house three people, the housing problem of one thousand three hundred and fifty more people can be solved.

　　In the entire project design, it is designed according to the "neighborhood unit" in the project. Each worker dormitory area has nine thousand to more than four thousand rooms, divided into several units. The center and four corners of each construction area are reserved for public construction land, which will be used for sports fields, primary schools, kindergartens, public canteens, bathrooms, cooperatives, and other buildings in the future. In addition to the 30-meter traffic trunk road on the edge, there is also a 60-meter-wide green belt, reserved for planting flowers, plants, and trees. Each construction area is a beautiful worker's new village where workers can live independently.

　　The houses to be built are required to be safe and durable, which requires preventing shoddy workmanship and the use of inferior materials. In the past, when state-owned factories and enterprises built dormitories, most of them were contracted and subcontracted by construction manufacturers, so the phenomenon of shoddy workmanship and the use of inferior materials was very common. This construction of workers' dormitories is completely different from the past. The materials, labor, and funds required for the entire project are uniformly allocated by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Construction Management Committee. The administration and trade union of the relevant factories, the construction workers on the site, and the engineering personnel formed a construction committee on the site to specifically grasp the project progress and engineering quality of their respective units.

　　On April 19th, batches of construction workers uniformly allocated by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government went to the construction site, and the huge project of building workers' dormitories began from the Zhongshanmenwai construction site in the Fifth District. The construction workers are very enthusiastic. The workers of the Eighth Committee of the Eleventh District of the Tianjin Construction Trade Union were the first to enter the construction site. As soon as they arrived at the construction site, they formulated a work agreement, guaranteeing not to waste materials and man-hours, abide by the labor discipline on the site, pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene to avoid getting sick, ensure the quality of the project, and strive to complete the project ahead of schedule. On the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they enthusiastically launched a challenge competition and generally improved labor efficiency. When they first started digging the trenches, sixteen workers could dig the trenches for a row of houses in one day; now eight people can dig a row in one day. The gray soil workers at the Tianjin Steel Plant construction site launched a challenge to ensure that twenty-eight workers would lay the gray soil for a row of houses well. The gray soil workers at the Tianjin Bicycle Factory construction site responded to the challenge by saying that twenty-seven workers would lay the gray soil for a row of houses well. In terms of bricklaying and making door and window materials, Fu Hongbin's circulating bricklaying method and Xie Wanfu's assembly line woodworking method were promoted. The Tianjin Yao Zengyi first-class model group, which used the circulating bricklaying method to lay walls at the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory construction site, built ten dormitory rooms in four days, saving two-thirds of the labor compared with the original plan of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Management Committee. The production efficiency of the ninety-eight carpenters at the Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory construction site, who used Xie Wanfu's assembly line woodworking method to make doors and windows, also nearly doubled. They worked selflessly and built part of the dormitories on the morning of "May Day" Labor Day.

　　Before and after the start of the construction project, another labor army appeared on the construction site—the voluntary labor team composed of workers and their families from the factories building the houses. Workers from each factory building the houses participated in voluntary labor without exception. The family members are also particularly active. As Zhang Mashi, the mother of a worker at the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, said: "After liberation, the reactionaries were driven away. After the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' campaigns, corruption and theft were eliminated, and now we are building dormitories for us. Our days are getting better and better. We must work every day so as not to fail Chairman Mao's concern." Workers seize the time to work on the construction site before and after work every day, and family members also seize the time to work on the construction site in addition to taking care of housework. The work of leveling the foundations, transporting materials, and taking care of the diet of construction workers for these workers' dormitories is mainly done by them. More than two hundred and ninety transportation and loading and unloading workers with excellent work performance from the Tianjin Steel Plant organized a voluntary labor team, divided into seven groups, with two groups participating in construction site labor every day. A few days ago, they took the initiative to assist construction workers in digging trenches, and each person dug five cubic meters of soil per day to complete the task. Song Wenlan, the sister of Song Wencai, a worker at the Bicycle Factory who has lived in broken thatched houses for three generations, goes to the construction site with her brother at six o'clock every morning, digging and carrying soil like a young man, and is also preparing to wash clothes for the construction workers. Although these people are participating in voluntary labor in their spare time, they have forgotten what fatigue is because excitement and joy are supporting them: the difficulties of generations have been resolved, and the wishes of many years have been realized!

    彻底解决天津工人住宿问题的第一步
    ——记天津市人民政府兴建工人宿舍
  　周抗
    过去三年中，天津市工人用忘我的劳动，为祖国创造了大量财富。随着生产的发展，工人的生活也有了不少改善。天津市人民政府，为解决工人多年期待而一直没有解决的住宿问题，决定在今年建筑五万间工人宿舍。这是彻底解决天津市工人住宿问题的第一步。其中第一批一万二千间的工程，已在四月十九日正式动工。
    当建筑工人宿舍的决定传到每个车间和每个工人家庭时，大家的兴奋是难以形容的。国营天津自行车厂钳工组技工刘恩铭听到这个消息，回家后立刻告诉他的父亲。他的父亲说：“我打十六岁做油漆活，净给人家油门刷墙，盖了好房子都是人家的。想不到我还能赶上今天，政府给咱工人盖房。咱们住了三辈子窝铺，这回算熬出来了。只有在毛主席、共产党领导下才有这样的幸福！”在日寇和国民党反动统治时期，反动派剥夺了劳动者的一切。工人们被榨干了血肉，不可能得到一个比较安适的栖身之所。解放后，工人的生活虽已显著提高，但是旧社会残留下的这个困苦还没有彻底解决。如国营天津自行车厂，仅有九十七间宿舍，全厂六百三十多工人中只有十四个单身工人和五十七个有家眷的工人住在厂里。国营天津第三棉纺织厂三千六百多工人中，有一千零八十人住在厂外，其中离厂最远的每天要走三十多里路，往返需要四个小时。有的需要过四次河，坐四次摆渡船。工人们没有适当的休息处所，不仅会影响工人和家属们的健康，也直接地妨碍了生产。像天津钢厂一分厂工人李锦秀，家住在张贵庄，距离工厂二十里，每天早六点上班，三点多钟就得起床，一天来回走四十里路，徒然增加了身体的疲劳。因此，工人们热望着能有个较好的居住环境。他们的期望，在共产党和人民政府对工人福利极其关怀的情况下今年开始实现了。依照毛主席的指示，天津市人民政府决定今年在五区中山门外、四区王串场、六区南北楼及其他地区建筑五万间工人宿舍，并决定在三五年内要彻底解决市内所有工人的居住问题。这次建筑工人宿舍的工程标准，是根据工人的切身需要，力求解决较多人的困难的原则下确定的。解放以后，有些国营工厂企业部门已着手解决工人的居住问题，并曾用掉很大一笔经费。但是宿舍的工程标准，不是从工人的切身要求和目前的实际需要出发，而是力求“美观”、“大方”。因此，花的钱很多，解决问题的范围很小。国营天津第五棉纺织厂去年春天建筑了一所“宫殿式”的工人宿舍，房子很讲究，有走廊、暖气、洗脸室、古式宫灯、水磨洋灰地等等，用了一大批经费，能住人的房屋却仅有四十八间。天津钢厂前年也曾盖了五十幢“西式房屋”，每幢都有卧室、会客室、厕所、厨房各一间。这本是按一家住一所设计的；但因急需房屋的工人太多，只好两三家住一幢；于是，一家住在卧室，另一家就不得不住会客室或者把厨房当成卧室。
    为了避免这种铺张浪费、不切实际的偏向，天津市人民政府经过反复研究，精密计划，设计出不同式样的十种房屋蓝图，并建造出示型房屋，邀请各厂工人和工人家属参观，征求他们的意见。经多次参观、讨论、修正后，确定了工人认为满意的工程标准。工人眷属宿舍净空长为四公尺，净空宽为三点三五公尺，净空面积为十三点四平方公尺，净空高为二点八五公尺。单身宿舍净空长为六公尺，净空宽为四公尺，净空面积为二十四平方公尺，净空高为三点三五公尺。宿舍装有玻璃门窗，地基铺有焦灰碴面，墙壁砌成“二五”实墙，有电灯及自来水等设备。每间宿舍的建筑费连同附属设备的造价为七百二十五万多元。用国营天津第五棉纺织厂建造四十八间“宫殿式”宿舍的经费，改建这种平房，可以多修四百五十间；每间房按住三口人计算，就可以多解决一千三百五十人的住宿问题。
    在整个工程设计上，是按工程中的“邻里单位”设计的。每个工人宿舍区，建筑房屋九千到四千多间不等，分为若干单元。每个建筑区的中央和四角，留有公共建筑用地，准备将来做为运动场、小学校、幼儿园、公共食堂、浴室、合作社等建筑用地。边缘上除有三十公尺的交通干路以外，并有六十公尺宽的绿色地带，留待种植花草树木。每个建筑区都是使工人可以在那里独立生活的美丽的工人新村。
    建筑的房子要求安全、耐久，这就必须防止偷工减料。过去各国营工厂企业建筑宿舍时，大多是经过营造厂商承包和转包，所以偷工减料现象十分普遍。这次建筑工人宿舍和过去完全不同，整个工程所需的材料、人工、经费都由天津市人民政府建筑管理委员会统一调配。有关工厂的行政和工会、现场的建筑工人和工程人员分别组成了工地建筑委员会，具体掌握本单位的工程进度和工程质量。
    四月十九日，由天津市人民政府统一调配的建筑工人一批批地开往工地，建筑工人宿舍的巨大工程，从五区中山门外工地开始了。建筑工人的劳动热情很高。天津市建筑工会十一区第八委员会的工人是开进工地的第一批。他们一到工地就订出了工作公约，保证不浪费物料和工时，遵守现场劳动纪律，注意清洁卫生以免生病，保证工程质量，争取提前完工。在“三反”“五反”运动胜利的基础上，他们热情澎湃地发起挑战竞赛，普遍提高了劳动效率。才开始刨槽时，十六个工人一天刨一排房子的槽；现在八个人一天就能刨一排。天津钢厂工地的灰土工，以保证二十八个工打好一排房子的灰土为条件发起挑战。天津自行车厂工地的灰土工则以二十七个工打好一排房子的灰土为条件应了战。在砌墙和做门窗口料方面，推行了傅鸿宾的循环砌砖法，和谢万福的木工流水作业法。在国营天津第一棉纺织厂工地运用循环砌砖法砌墙的天津姚增义一等模范小组，在四天之内砌好十间宿舍，比天津市建筑管理委员会原来的计划节省三分之二的人工。用谢万福木工流水作业法制做门窗的天津第一棉纺织厂工地的九十八个木工，生产效率也几乎提高了一倍。他们忘我地劳动着，在“五一”劳动节的早晨，盖起了一部分宿舍。
    建筑工程开始以前和以后，工地上还出现了另一支劳动大军——建房各厂工人和工人家属组成的义务劳动大队。建房各厂的工人几乎无例外地参加了义务劳动。家属们也特别积极。正如棉纺一厂一位工人的母亲张马氏所说的：“解放了，打跑了反动派，这回‘三反’和‘五反’，反掉了贪污和盗窃分子以后，又给我们盖宿舍，我们的日子是越过越美，我们一定每天去劳动，才不辜负毛主席的关心。”工人每天上班之前和下班之后，家属们在料里家务之余，都抓紧时间到工地劳动。这批工人宿舍的平垫地基，运送材料，照顾建筑工人饮食等工作主要是由他们来做的。天津钢厂的二百九十多个工作成绩优良的运输装卸工人，组织了一个义务劳动大队，分成七个组，每天有两个组参加工地劳动。前几天，他们主动协助建筑工人刨槽，每人每天都挖五立方公尺的土才算完成任务。家中三辈子住破草房的自行车厂工人宋文才的妹妹宋文兰，每天早上六点和哥哥一起到工地，挖土、挑土都和小伙子一样，还准备给建筑工人洗衣服。这些人虽然是在工余参加义务劳动的，但是他们忘掉了什么叫疲劳，因为兴奋和喜悦在支持着他们：累世以来的困难解决了，多年的愿望实现了！（附图片）
