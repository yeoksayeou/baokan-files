To the Editor: The Fifteenth District Committee of the CCP Laiyang County, Shandong Province, neglects the leadership of propaganda work, making the district's propaganda network merely a formality.

　　In the eight months from July of last year to March of this year, Guanzhuang Township only held two propaganda cadre meetings. Most propaganda cadres did not know what they should do or how to do it. This situation also exists in other townships.

　　Some of the original propaganda tools in the Fifteenth District have not been well utilized. For example, the blackboard newspapers are all copied from the newspapers by elementary school teachers, and have no connection with the actual situation in the villages; the loudspeakers have also become tools for calling people to meetings; few people read the newspapers. There are several reading groups in the Communist Youth League branches, but they have not become a force for promoting work.

　　The Fifteenth District does not have a strong propaganda force, and cannot regularly carry out propaganda to the broad masses. Often, the Party's policies are implemented and various tasks are arranged through meetings. As a result, there are too many meetings, but the education of the masses is not enough, and all kinds of work have been in a passive state. Some cadres have also developed a work style of coercion and commandism. When assigning the task of winter plowing last year, Zhao Shiyun, the secretary of the front township general branch, said at a village meeting: "The meeting will not be dismissed until winter plowing is done." The masses were very dissatisfied with this practice. As a result, only 2,000 mu of the 25,000 mu of winter plowing task were completed.

　　The above situation is caused by the district committee's abandonment of leadership. When the district committee studies work, it has never seriously studied the work of the propaganda network. In eight months, the district committee only held one representative meeting of propaganda cadres, and no other special meetings on propaganda work were held. The newspaper reading group in Dongmenzhuang Village is doing a relatively good job, but the district committee has never paid attention to it, and has not given it any help or guidance.

　　I think the Fifteenth District Committee of the CCP Laiyang County should thoroughly examine its attitude towards the propaganda network, and the CCP Laiyang County Committee should also supervise it.

### 中共莱阳县十五区区委  忽视对宣传工作的领导应速纠正

    中共莱阳县十五区区委
    忽视对宣传工作的领导应速纠正
    编辑同志：中共山东莱阳县十五区区委会忽视对宣传工作的领导，使全区的宣传网流于形式。
    去年七月到今年三月的八个月中，官庄乡只开过两次宣传员会，大多数宣传员不知道自己应做什么和怎么做。这种情况在其他各乡也存在着。
    十五区原有的一些宣传工具也没有很好地加以运用。如黑板报都是由小学教师从报上抄下来的，根本和村里的实际情况没有连系；广播筒也成了开会叫人的工具；看报纸的人很少，在青年团支部中有几个读报组，但也没有成为推动工作的力量。
    十五区没有一支坚强的宣传队伍，不能经常地向广大群众进行宣传，常常是通过开会来贯彻党的政策，布置各项工作，结果，会议过多，对群众的教育却很不够，各种工作一直陷于被动状态。某些干部也就发展了强迫命令的作风。去年布置冬耕任务时，前头乡总支书记赵世云在村民会上说：“不冬耕就不散会。”群众对这种作法非常不满，结果二万五千亩的冬耕任务，只完成了二千亩。
    以上情况是区委放弃领导造成的。区委在研究工作时，从来没有认真地研究过宣传网的工作。在八个月中，区委只召开过一次宣传员代表会议，其他有关宣传工作的专门会议一次也没开过。洞门庄村的读报组搞得比较好，但区委始终没有重视，没有给以帮助或指导。
    我认为中共莱阳县十五区委应彻底检查对宣传网的态度，中共莱阳县委也应加以督促。  应时珊
