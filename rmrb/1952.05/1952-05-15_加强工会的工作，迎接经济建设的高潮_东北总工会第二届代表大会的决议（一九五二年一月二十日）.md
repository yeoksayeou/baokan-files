The Second Congress of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions unanimously adopted Comrade Zhang Weizhen's report and made the following resolution:

The First Congress of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions was held at the same time as the Sixth National Labor Congress, more than three years ago. In the past three years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the working class of Northeast China has played a great role as the leading class of the country in various undertakings such as supporting the Liberation War, restoring and developing the economy of Northeast China, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. The broad masses of workers and staff in state-owned and public enterprises have improved their class consciousness and established a new attitude towards labor through democratic reforms in enterprises, the New Record Movement, patriotic emulation campaigns, and the movement to increase production and practice economy. Employees of private enterprises have also implemented the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, thus the Northeast industry, which was destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, has been rapidly restored and developed.

In 1951, the total industrial output value of Northeast China had recovered to 87.6 percent of the highest historical level, and the proportion of industry in the national economy increased from 35 percent in 1949 to 52 percent. The labor productivity of state-owned enterprises was equivalent to 142 percent of the highest historical level. Taking Shenyang as an example of private enterprises, according to statistics from the first half of 1951, the number of households increased by 41.45 percent compared with 1949; the number of workers increased by 57.34 percent. The increase in urban and rural material exchange, domestic and foreign trade, and the manufacturing of new-style agricultural implements have further promoted social and economic development and consolidated the worker-peasant alliance. Transportation, culture, and education have also developed rapidly. In production and work, a large number of male and female labor models, advanced groups, and some advanced workshops and factories have emerged, and many advanced production experiences have been created. The working class of Northeast China has begun to learn the management of modern industry. The movement to increase production and practice economy launched last year in response to Chairman Gao Gang's call has brought a new atmosphere to the working class and factory and mining enterprises in Northeast China. Tapping potential, finding shortcuts, and proposing rationalization suggestions have begun to become widespread mass movements; patriotic labor emulation campaigns, due to the participation of the broad masses of workers and the combination of labor, technology, and management, have gradually become regularized. Under the leadership of the Party, trade unions, administrative departments, and Communist Youth League organizations in enterprises have been more coordinated and closely cooperated, thus giving full play to the high enthusiasm and creativity of the workers and staff. By the end of November last year, they had created and saved wealth equivalent to 14.58 million tons of grain for the country, preparing the conditions for the large-scale economic construction with key points and steps that will begin this year.

Due to the recovery and development of production, the phenomenon of worker unemployment has been eliminated. The ranks of the working class in Northeast China have greatly expanded. The number of workers and staff in factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry system alone has increased by 208.32 percent compared with the beginning of 1949. The material and cultural life of workers and staff has been improved accordingly. The average wage of workers and staff in state-owned enterprises has increased from 70 points at the time of the First Congress to the current 164.8 points. The state has promulgated laws protecting labor, conducted major safety inspections, improved the safety and health conditions of factories and mines, implemented labor insurance, and held various types of labor insurance collective undertakings. To date, 500,000 workers and staff regularly study in spare-time cultural schools, of which about 100,000 illiterates have become literate. More than 30,000 cadres have been trained through worker political universities and training classes in various provinces and cities. Tens of thousands of outstanding industrial workers have been promoted to work in state organs, enterprise departments, and Party organizations and mass organizations.

Through its own work and the undertakings it has held, the trade union has established extensive contacts with the workers and staff, and has established more than 12,000 grassroots trade union organizations among 2.2 million organized workers and staff, with more than 1.6 million members. Trade union members account for more than 90 percent of the workers and staff in major industrial sectors. Grassroots trade union work has gained some useful experience.

"All facts prove that our people's democratic dictatorship system has great superiority over the political system of capitalist countries. On the basis of this system, the people of our country can exert their infinite strength. This strength cannot be overcome by any enemy." (Chairman Mao)

Our achievements are due to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the direct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the concerted efforts of the broad masses of workers and staff.

The experience of the past three years has made us gradually realize that to do a good job in trade union work, we must pay attention to the following issues.

First, trade union work must focus on developing production, and gradually improve the material and cultural life of workers and staff on the basis of developing production.

Under the new democratic regime, trade union work is carried out under completely new conditions. Here, the working class is the leading class in the new democratic regime. The liberated working class, as Lenin pointed out, "The most important and fundamental interest is to increase the quantity of production and greatly improve social productivity." Comrade Mao Zedong also instructed us to gradually improve the lives of workers on the basis of increasing production. Therefore, as the mass organization of the working class, the leading class of the country - the trade union, its central task is to develop production, and to do a good job in the three-in-one work of production, life, and education around the central task of developing production. The facts of the past three years have proved that trade union organizations that have a correct understanding of the nature and tasks of the trade union, unite all new and old workers, technical personnel, and staff, and take leading the masses in production work as their central task have made great achievements. They go deep into production, grasp the key issues in production, study and promote advanced production experience, help workers formulate patriotic competition covenants, contact contracts, collective contracts, care about and solve the specific problems in workers' lives, and thus often overfulfill production plans. Factory bonus funds and the wage income of workers and staff have increased, and the labor conditions and material and cultural life of workers have also been improved accordingly, which in turn has further improved the enthusiasm of workers. However, many of our cadres, including the leading cadres of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, for a period of time, in actual work, either shouted empty slogans about the difficulties of workers' lives and relaxed their research on production; or they called for production in isolation, without caring about the lives of the workers and staff; or they put production and other trade union work on an equal footing. These are all ideas and practices that oppose production and life, and they are all one-sided and wrong. Because it hinders both the development of production and the possible improvement of workers' lives. The promulgation of the Trade Union Law, the industrial rectification conference of the Northeast Bureau, and Comrade Gao Gang's instructions at the Third Enlarged Executive Committee meeting of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions played an important role in correcting the leading ideology of trade union cadres, and made important developments in subsequent trade union work. Therefore, in future trade union work, it is still very important to continue to implement the idea of focusing on developing production, caring about the possible improvement of workers' lives, and explaining to the workers that workers' lives can only be improved gradually by relying on the development of production and according to the principle of more work, more pay.

Second, constantly improve the political awareness of workers and staff, and organize workers and staff to actively learn business management.

The trade union must regularly educate the workers and staff with Marxism-Leninism - Mao Zedong Thought, improve the awareness level of the workers and staff, so that the workers and staff understand their position as the masters of the country and the responsibilities they should bear, understand the relationship between the individual and the country, between today and tomorrow, overcome various backward ideas, and actively learn business management. It is fundamentally wrong to regard the trade union as a mass organization that does not ask about politics. In the past three years, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, in close leadership of the Party, has conducted extensive political enlightenment education, historical materialism education, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and education on increasing production and practicing economy for workers and staff in combination with the political and economic tasks of each period; at the same time, various enterprises have implemented democratic reforms after liberation, abolished body searches, beatings and scoldings, and the head system, basically transformed the old personnel relations by means of criticism and self-criticism, established factory worker representative conferences and management committees, and implemented factory management democratization and various production reforms. This has gradually eliminated the unreasonable systems remaining within the socialist state-owned enterprises. Due to the promulgation of various labor laws and regulations by the People's Government, private enterprises have also considerably improved the labor conditions of workers through the signing of collective contracts, labor-capital consultation, and other methods; thus it is possible to establish the idea of workers and staff as masters of the country and a new attitude towards labor. Experience has proved that if regular political education and democratization of enterprise management are neglected, true labor competition is impossible. If the workers and staff do not regard participating in the business management of state-owned enterprises as their own responsibility, but merely as a right, it is impossible to realize the leading role of the working class in national construction. Therefore, the trade union must constantly organize workers to conduct regular political, cultural, and technical learning, actively learn business management, in order to truly become, as Lenin said, a school of management, a school of business, and a school of communism.

Third, strengthen the grassroots trade union organization in order to realize the tasks of the trade union.

The grassroots trade union organization is the foundation of the trade union, and is the most basic link in the trade union organization system. All the work of the trade union must be carried out through and rely on the grassroots organization. The higher-level trade union must face the grassroots level and strengthen the leadership over the grassroots organization.

The grassroots organizations of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions have developed and progressed after overcoming closed-doorism, especially after clarifying that the trade union should focus on developing production, and some advanced grassroots organizations have also emerged. However, due to our insufficient understanding of the important significance of grassroots organization construction and the lack of in-depth leadership, the general grassroots organizations have not yet established comprehensive and regular work, and the organizational role of the trade union is very weak, which greatly affects the progress of trade union work.

To strengthen the organization of the grassroots trade union is to strengthen the work of the grassroots trade union committee, the workshop committee, and the group. The various work committees of the grassroots trade union must be gradually established according to actual needs and in combination with the current work tasks, otherwise, it is bound to be formalism. All trade union workers should rely on the workers and staff, closely care about and seriously solve the problems in the production and life of the masses, cultivate activists, and establish a work system, so that the organization can gradually be strengthened and the organizational role of the trade union can be brought into play.

After the urban work conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the industrial trade unions of various provinces and cities began to have their own typical grassroots organizations, and responsible cadres began to go deep into factories and workshops. This experience must be promoted and adhered to. Only by strengthening the grassroots organization can all the work of the trade union be truly implemented and the contact with the masses can be strengthened.

Fourth, rely on the leadership of the Party, and work in unity with the administration and the Communist Youth League in state-owned enterprises.

The Party is the highest form of organization of the working class, and the leadership of the Party is the reliable guarantee for our work to achieve success. Trade unions at all levels should work under the leadership of the Party committee at the same level. Every trade union worker must carefully study and publicize the Party's policies, instructions, and documents, and conscientiously organize the implementation, so as to closely unite the broad masses of workers and staff around the Party and make the trade union truly become the link between the Party and the working class. Any idea or practice that puts the trade union and the Party on an equal footing is wrong.

State-owned enterprises are enterprises of a socialist nature. Here, the position and basic tasks of the trade union and the enterprise administration are consistent, and there should be no friction between them. The so-called view that the positions of each other are different is fundamentally wrong. Therefore, for the various tasks in the enterprise, the trade union must seek unity of understanding and coordination in step with the administrative side and the Communist Youth League under the leadership of the Party, and there must be a clear division of labor. When there are different opinions on issues of principle, discussions should be held; the purpose is to clarify the issues and seek agreement. Daily affairs should be consulted with each other and solutions should be sought. A working environment of unity should be created on the basis of mutual concern, mutual assistance, and criticism and self-criticism, so as to work from all aspects to realize the country's economic plan, and thoroughly eliminate the idea of mutual opposition and each doing their own thing.

These are some basic understandings that we have gained in our trade union work in the past three years. This must continue to be implemented in future work.

What should be the tasks and work of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions in the future?

The great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea must continue until the enemy is willing to resolve it peacefully. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, further increase production, practice strict economy, support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive for the final victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

After several years of recovery and development, the economy of Northeast China has enabled us to start large-scale economic construction with key points and steps this year. This is to further enhance our economic and defense strength to meet the coming high tide of large-scale economic construction across the country. This is the main task of the working class in Northeast China and the responsibility to the people of the whole country.

All workers and staff in Northeast China must continue to work hard, deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, infinitely tap the potential of enterprises, improve the business management of enterprises, vigorously promote advanced production experience and advanced working methods, in order to increase labor productivity and accumulate more construction funds; at the same time, they must strive to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of workers and staff, and cultivate a large number of cadres with political awareness, culture, business, and technical knowledge to meet the large-scale economic construction. With the development of economic construction, the material and cultural life of the working class will gradually improve.

The Party organizations and the Northeast People's Government have set our production, financial, and technical plans for 1952. According to the plan, the total industrial output value of Northeast China this year will increase by 40.3 percent compared with last year, and labor productivity will increase by 15 percent in state-owned enterprises and 20 percent in local enterprises.

All workers and staff in Northeast China will enthusiastically launch a movement to discuss the national plan, formulate advanced production and economy plans or patriotic competition covenants for their own factories and mines, workshops, groups, and individuals through mass discussions as a goal of struggle, in order to create and save more wealth for the country.

At present, the focus of increasing production and practicing economy in factories and mines under the Ministry of Industry is to continue to improve the technical management and production management of workshops in order to improve the utilization rate of equipment and product quality; strengthen the cost management of workshops, so that most workshops implement cost accounting. In terms of capital construction, it is necessary to strengthen design, do a good job in preparation, rationally organize labor, ensure quality, and accelerate the progress of the project. In local industry, it is necessary to fully utilize existing potential and implement the economic accounting system. In the state-owned trade system, it is necessary to expand and accelerate the circulation of commodities and reduce the cost of commodity circulation. In the transportation system, it is necessary to shorten the turnover rate and strengthen the planning and discipline in transportation. In government and cultural and educational departments, it is necessary to carry out ideological transformation, improve work efficiency, and strictly practice streamlining and economy. In all departments, it is necessary to launch a mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Employees of private enterprises should also advocate economy, ensure product quality, oppose bribery, oppose tax evasion, oppose theft of state property, oppose shoddy work and the use of inferior materials, oppose theft of national economic intelligence, and strive to guide capitalists to use all available funds to expand industrial production and serve urban and rural material exchange.

In order to achieve the above requirements, the following work needs to be done:

I. Launch a comprehensive and in-depth patriotic labor competition and vigorously promote advanced experience in production.

The patriotic labor competition is a method to enable the backward workers in production to catch up with the advanced workers, and the advanced workers to improve further, so as to achieve comprehensive improvement and continuous improvement. Increasing production and practicing economy must be based on the production plan, rely on the broad masses of workers and staff, and form a vigorous competition movement in order to achieve the goal. All workers and staff should strengthen political study, recognize the positive significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and understand that increasing production and practicing economy is not a temporary movement, but a basic method to gradually realize national industrialization and improve the lives of the working people; therefore, they should oppose conservative ideas, correct complacency, and the view of completing tasks casually. Technical personnel and staff should actively launch a movement of self-education and self-transformation, establish a firm idea of serving the people, eliminate the ideological style of the old society, and overcome the shortcomings of only starting from personal interests in work, neglecting the practical experience of workers, not going deep into the field, and not being at ease in work. If everyone can connect their labor with the great cause of communism, then our competition will have a solid ideological foundation, and will inevitably turn the movement to increase production and practice economy into a regular combat task of the working class in Northeast China.

In the competition, special attention should be paid to advanced experience in improving technology, improving tools, and improving labor organization. The promotion of various advanced experiences will bring huge wealth to the country and a series of improvements from mass work to production management work. Therefore, summarizing and promoting advanced experience in production should become the central content of the current competition, which is the main method to improve labor productivity.

Advanced experience exists everywhere. The problem lies in earnestly summarizing and promoting it in a planned way. In promoting advanced experience, we must especially focus on decisive experiences, such as the new coal mining method, rapid tunneling method, and Shi Yuhai's safe production experience in the coal mine system, the high-speed cutting method and multi-tool multi-edge cutting method in the machinery system, the Su Changyou bricklaying method in the construction industry, the over-axis movement, 500-kilometer movement, and Li Xikui's shunting method in the railway system, the Jiang Wanshou experience in the clothing industry, and the Ma Hengchang group experience that has long been promoted. We should learn from the experience of the textile system in promoting the "Hao Jianxiu working method" and the "1951 weaving working method," and promote it vigorously, in a planned and organized way. We must boldly advocate the pioneering spirit of the masses, establish an organization to lead rationalization suggestions, and oppose conservative ideas and bureaucratic styles that do not pay attention to the creation of the masses and bury advanced experience. Our newspapers should become a forum for disseminating advanced experience.

Each industry, each factory, each workshop, and each production group must create and learn one to several kinds of decisive advanced experience to improve their production work. Pay attention to helping the backward units and backward workers in production, and organize them to learn advanced experience. This is the social obligation of every advanced worker and advanced unit. This is the communist principle of helping the backward for the sake of overall development.

Trade unions at all levels should vigorously organize workers' technical study, rectify technical study organizations, establish technical research associations in workshops, help workers better use equipment, save man-hours, save raw materials, and encourage workers to find shortcuts and put forward rationalization suggestions to create more and more advanced working methods. We should help workers understand the technical operating procedures, and establish strict and conscious labor discipline with compliance with the operating procedures as the main point. Units with incomplete operating procedures should make the formulation and implementation of operating procedures a movement combining labor and technology through performance, synthesis, and training.

Trade unions at all levels should conduct extensive quota education, lead workers to help the administrative side formulate progressive technical quotas, oppose conservative ideas, and help workers reach and exceed the quotas. The wage policy stipulated by the government must be organized for workers to discuss and implement. In particular, piece-rate wages and time-based bonus systems are levers to promote workers' technical learning and the material basis for competition. The trade union should actively assist the enterprise administration in promoting it in combination with production. Strive to implement piece-rate wages for 50 to 60 percent of the registered production workers this year. In promoting the piece-rate wage system, special attention should be paid to and care should be given to the old technical workers, so that their wage income can be reasonable. We must strive to help them, bring their role into play, and promote them to the positions of managing production and guiding production in a planned and gradual way.

The trade union must more widely guide young workers to participate in the competition, strive to help young workers learn technology, care about and improve their cultural and living facilities; pay attention to the labor protection of female workers, and systematically improve their production proficiency.

The organizational leadership of the competition must be strengthened. It is necessary to consolidate the group patriotic competition covenants, contact contracts, and promote collective contracts, launch group and workshop competitions, and gradually develop them into competitions between factories and mines. In order to strengthen the leadership of the competition, major issues in the competition of each factory and mine should be submitted to the management committee for discussion and decision. The trade union should take the responsibility of direct organization, and conduct regular mass inspections, evaluations, summaries, and rewards to overcome the current bureaucratic style of some trade union organizations that allow the movement to run its course and are satisfied with general calls and superficial enthusiasm. All trade union cadres should go deep into the workshops to discover problems, solve problems, promote the competition forward, and combine the competition with the new business management system in the enterprise, and gradually become the daily labor life of the workers and staff.

At present, the development of the competition is unbalanced. Therefore, the workers and staff of each factory and mine must take care of the characteristics of their industry and the original work base while learning from the competition experience of advanced factories and mines, and give play to their own creativity to find a competition form that suits their own characteristics in order to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy.

We must immediately launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This is a new and historically significant revolutionary struggle. Without the victory of this struggle, our labor achievements in increasing production and practicing economy and the country's construction funds will be stolen and wasted in large quantities, and many cadres and staff will be corrupted and destroyed. Countless facts have proved that many lawless elements of the bourgeoisie not only use their corrupt and degenerate ideas to erode the fighting working class and pull away some wavering elements, but even send people to infiltrate our state organs, state-owned enterprises, and economic departments to steal state property. The essence of this struggle is a struggle against the corrupt and degenerate ideas of the bourgeoisie, and a resolute counterattack against the rampant attacks of illegal bourgeois elements against the working class. We must win victory in this serious class struggle. Therefore, all corrupt, wasteful, and bureaucratic elements should immediately confess, and the broad masses of workers and staff should bravely report in order to massively eliminate the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

Employees in private enterprises should especially boldly expose the crimes of capitalists in bribery and theft of national wealth, improve their class awareness, eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, distinguish between labor and capital, and supervise capitalists to conscientiously implement national policies and laws, so that private enterprises can be further developed on the track of benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood.

II. The trade union should closely care about the lives of workers and staff, and strive to make possible improvements.

At present, the central issue is to increase production and practice strict economy, but at the same time, we must always care about the lives of workers and staff, and strive to make possible improvements. If we take a bureaucratic attitude towards the difficulties in the lives of workers and staff, we will not only be detached from the masses, but also affect the enthusiasm of workers and staff in production.

The trade union should cooperate with the administrative side to resolutely implement the state's various labor protection laws and regulations, improve safety and health equipment in a planned way, pay attention to environmental sanitation, and strengthen safety and health education for workers and staff in order to eliminate responsibility-related casualties and gradually reduce occupational diseases and general diseases. We should fully and rationally use labor insurance funds and factory bonus funds, strengthen the management of labor insurance undertakings, and establish sanatoriums and labor insurance canteens according to the needs of the masses, and adjust general sanatoriums. The trade union should do a good job in the living and housing of workers and staff, actively assist the enterprise administrative side in improving workers' canteens and the medical and health work of factories and mines to improve the health level of workers and staff. We should increase nurseries and kindergartens, suggest that the administrative side increase the construction of simple workers' housing according to state investment, and suggest that the municipal people's government improve the traffic conditions and municipal facilities in workers' residential areas, and promote state-owned stores and cooperatives to improve the supply of workers and staff, and ensure the quality of daily necessities to facilitate workers and staff.

The trade union should widely organize the mutual aid undertakings of workers and staff, promote class love between workers and staff, and advocate mutual help to solve difficulties. The 20 percent of the trade union dues for relief should be used to relieve workers in difficulty, and should not be left unused because of the small amount of money. We must do a good job in the mutual assistance of family members, improve the awareness of the family members of workers and staff, and manage household affairs well.

The trade union is the organization of the workers and staff themselves. The responsible cadres of the trade union must be good at "placing themselves within the life of the workers, knowing all aspects of this life, being able to correctly and unerringly judge the mood of the masses and their actual intentions, needs, and thoughts at any time, on any issue, being able to clearly determine the degree of awareness of the masses and the impact of certain old prejudices or remnants of old ideas on the masses without any hypocrisy, being able to treat the masses with a comradely attitude, and caring for the satisfaction of the demands of the masses, so as to win the infinite faith of the masses." (Lenin) Our cadres at all levels of the trade union must do this in order to gradually make the trade union truly become the leader and organizer of the lives of workers and staff, and to better lead the workers to bring into play their infinite creative power.

III. Strengthen workers' spare-time education and train worker cadres.

In order to successfully complete the plan to increase production and practice economy, and to prepare talents for large-scale economic construction, all workers and staff should strive to improve their political, cultural, and technical level. With the expansion of the ranks of the working class, it is also our common responsibility to help and improve the political, cultural, and technical level of new workers and staff.

This year, we must organize the broad masses of workers and staff to universally participate in the study of communism and the Communist Party led by the Party committees at all levels, so that the workers and staff have a basic understanding of communism and the Communist Party. Prepare to basically eliminate illiteracy among existing industrial workers and general fixed workers in about three to five years. In addition to organizing workers to improve their technology in practical operations, we must also organize workers with a cultural level above elementary school to conduct systematic technical knowledge learning.

To this end, first of all, we must make workers and staff fully aware of the significance of participating in spare-time learning and consciously participate in learning. Secondly, the trade union must attach importance to this political task, formulate a specific plan for unified spare-time learning under the leadership of the Party committee, and cooperate with relevant parties to effectively solve the problem of teaching materials, and hire outstanding workers as teachers; there should also be a certain number of full-time teachers in cultural learning organizations. We must ensure learning time. Vocational spare-time schools can be established in larger enterprises to uniformly lead the political, cultural, and technical learning of workers and staff. Major issues should be submitted to the factory management committee for discussion and decision. The leadership of vocational spare-time learning must proceed from the requirements of workers and the actual situation of factories and mines. Subjectivism, eagerness for success, or one-sided emphasis on regularization are bound to fail.

In order to train a large number of worker cadres, we must run the Northeast Trade Union Cadre School (that is, Northeast Workers' Political University) and the training classes of the trade unions of various provinces and cities well. Excellent workers should be sent to study in workers and peasants' accelerated middle schools and technical schools in a planned way.

In each enterprise, workshop clubrooms should be established as much as possible, mobile book boxes should be established, and mass cultural and sports activities should be organized. Radio stations, blackboards, and movies should all become weapons for trade unions to conduct political education, production propaganda, contact the masses, and inspire the enthusiasm of the masses.

IV. Strengthen trade union organization construction and improve leadership style.

In order to complete the tasks of the trade union, we must improve the trade union organization, especially the grassroots organization. Continue to promote the work experience of advanced grassroots organizations such as the "May 3rd" Factory, train cadres in a planned way, and make trade union cadres clearly understand the nature, tasks, and practices of trade union work. In the next year or so, the general factory and mine trade unions are required to basically achieve: 1. Establishing a system of regular planned work, inspection work, reporting on situations, studying documents, and researching work; 2. Regularly holding group meetings and workshop production meetings; 3. Regularly reporting work, reporting expenses, and listening to mass criticisms to members.

We must strengthen the work of the workshop committee. The workshop committee should closely combine with the requirements of the movement to increase production and practice economy, organize production meetings, and cultivate advanced groups. Cadres who hold equivalent positions in the Party committee, the administrative side, and the Communist Youth League should participate in various trade union organizations. This is not only convenient for cooperation, but also can bring into play the organizational role of the trade union.

The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the provincial and municipal-level trade unions should earnestly improve their level of leadership and organizational work, change their leadership style, abolish those meetings and reports that do not solve problems, simplify handling procedures, and improve work efficiency. All trade union cadres, especially leading cadres, should go deep into the grassroots and into the workshops to specifically help the following solve problems.

Each industrial trade union should focus on solving the special problems of production, wages, labor protection, and other industries under the leadership of the local trade union. First of all, it is necessary to do a good job in investigation and research and promote advanced experience. In large cities, in order to strengthen the leadership of the municipal federation of trade unions over the scattered and private enterprise grassroots organizations, the district offices of the municipal federation of trade unions should be established according to the situation, but the staffing should be based on being streamlined.

Trade union work should be focused on leadership, but it must take care of the overall situation. Central work should be appropriately combined with regular business. Pay close attention to the imbalance in the development of our work; do not treat the situation in a part as the whole. Completing our glorious tasks requires us to make great efforts. There will be difficulties, but as long as we rely closely on the leadership of the Party and unite the broad masses of workers and staff, we can overcome any difficulties. Mistakes and shortcomings may also occur in our work, which requires us to fully promote democracy and launch criticism and self-criticism from bottom to top and from top to bottom; as long as we firmly grasp this fighting weapon of the working class, our work will continue to move forward.

    加强工会的工作，迎接经济建设的高潮
    ——东北总工会第二届代表大会的决议（一九五二年一月二十日）
    东北总工会第二届代表大会，一致通过了张维桢同志的报告，并做出如下的决议：
    东北总工会第一届代表大会是和全国第六次劳动大会同时举行的，到现在三年多了。三年以来，东北工人阶级在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在支援解放战争、恢复与发展东北经济、抗美援朝、镇压反革命及巩固人民民主专政的各项事业中，发挥了国家领导阶级的伟大作用。国营公营企业中的广大职工群众，经过了企业的民主改革、新纪录运动、爱国主义竞赛和增产节约运动，提高了阶级觉悟，树立了新的劳动态度。私营企业的职工，也执行了发展生产、劳资两利的政策，因而被日寇和国民党反动派破坏了的东北工业得到了迅速的恢复和发展。
    一九五一年东北工业的生产总值已恢复到历史上最高水平的百分之八十七点六，工业在国民经济中的比重，由一九四九年的百分之三十五增加到百分之五十二。国营企业的劳动生产率，相当于历史上最高水平的百分之一百四十二。私营企业以沈阳为例，根据一九五一年上半年的统计，较一九四九年户数增加了百分之四十一点四五；工人增加了百分之五十七点三四。城乡物资交流、内外贸易的增加和新式农具的制造，更推动了社会经济的发展，巩固了工农联盟。交通运输和文化教育等方面，也有了飞速的发展。在生产和工作中，出现了大批的男女劳动模范、先进小组和一些先进的车间、工厂，并创造了许多先进生产经验。东北工人阶级已开始学会了近代工业的经营管理。去年响应高岗主席号召所开展的增产节约运动，给东北工人阶级和东北厂矿企业带来了新的气象。挖潜力，找窍门，提合理化建议，开始成为广泛的群众运动；爱国主义劳动竞赛，由于广大职工群众的参加和劳动、技术、管理的结合，已逐渐走上经常化。在党的领导下，企业中工会和行政、青年团组织更协调一致，密切地配合工作，因而发挥了职工群众高度的积极性和创造性，到去年十一月底，已为国家创造和节约了一千四百五十八万吨粮食的财富，给今年开始的有重点有步骤的大规模经济建设准备了条件。
    由于生产的恢复和发展，消灭了工人失业现象。东北工人阶级的队伍已大为扩大，仅工业部系统所属厂矿的职工，已较一九四九年初增加了百分之二百零八点三二。职工的物质和文化生活，随之有了改善。国营企业职工的平均工资，由第一届代表大会时的七十分，增加到现在的一百六十四点八分。国家颁布了保护劳动的法令，进行了保安大检查，改善了厂矿的安全卫生状况，实行了劳动保险，举办了各类劳动保险集体事业。到目前为止，经常在业余文化学校学习的已有五十万职工，其中已有十万左右文盲变为非文盲。经过工人政治大学和各省市训练班的教育，培养了三万多名干部。数以万计的优秀的产业工人，被提拔到国家机关、企业部门与党组织和群众组织中担任工作。
    工会通过自己的工作和举办的事业，与职工群众建立了广泛的联系，已在二百二十万有组织的职工中，建立了一万二千余工会基层组织，会员发展到一百六十万余名。主要产业部门的职工中，工会会员占百分之九十以上。基层工会工作，已摸到一些有益的经验。
    “一切事实都证明：我们的人民民主专政的制度，较之资本主义国家的政治制度具有极大的优越性。在这种制度的基础上，我国人民能够发挥其无穷无尽的力量。这种力量，是任何敌人所不能战胜的。”    （毛主席）
    我们的成绩是由于毛主席和共产党的领导得来的，是由于中共中央东北局的直接领导、广大职工群众的一致努力得来的。
    三年来的经验，使我们逐渐明确地认识了要做好工会工作，必须注意以下几个问题。
    第一、工会工作必须以发展生产为中心，并在发展生产的基础上逐渐改善职工的物质、文化生活。
    新民主主义政权下，工会工作是在完全新的条件下进行的。在这里，工人阶级是新民主主义政权中的领导阶级。解放了的工人阶级，正如列宁所指出的，“最主要和最根本的利益，就是增加生产品量，大大提高社会生产力”。毛泽东同志也指示我们在增产的基础上逐步改良工人生活。因此，做为国家领导阶级的工人阶级的群众组织——工会，其中心任务就是发展生产，并围绕发展生产这个中心任务去做好生产、生活和教育三位一体的工作。三年来的事实证明：凡对工会的性质和任务有了正确认识，团结了全体新老工人、技术人员和职员，并以领导群众生产工作为中心任务的工会组织，都做出了很大成绩。他们深入生产，抓住生产中的关键问题，研究与推广先进生产经验，帮助工人订立爱国竞赛公约、联系合同、集体合同，关心与解决工人生活中的具体问题，因而经常超额完成生产计划。工厂奖励基金与职工的工资收入增加了，工人的劳动条件与物质、文化生活也都随之有了改善，反转来又更提高了职工的劳动积极性。但我们也有许多干部，包括东北工会的领导干部在内，有一个时期，在实际工作中，不是空喊工人生活困难，放松对生产的钻研；就是孤立地号召生产，不关心职工群众的生活；或者把生产和工会其他工作平列起来。这都是把生产和生活对立起来的思想与作法，都是片面的和错误的。因为它既妨害了生产的发展，又妨害了工人生活可能的改善。工会法的颁布，东北局的工业整风会议，及东北总工会第三次扩大执委会会议上的高岗同志的指示，对端正工会干部的领导思想，起了重要作用，使以后的工会工作有了重要发展。因此，今后在工会工作中，继续贯彻以发展生产为中心的思想，关心职工生活可能的改善，并向工人群众说明，工人的生活只能依靠生产的发展并按多劳多得的原则逐步加以改善，这仍然是十分重要的。
    第二、不断地提高职工的政治觉悟，组织职工积极学习经营管理。
    工会必须经常以马克思、列宁主义——毛泽东思想来教育职工群众，提高职工群众的觉悟水平，使职工认识自己所处的国家主人的地位和应负的责任，认识个人与国家、今天与明天的关系，克服各种落后思想，积极地学习经营管理。把工会认为是不问政治的群众组织是根本错误的。三年以来，东北工会结合每个时期的政治任务和经济任务，在党的密切领导下，对职工进行了广泛的政治启蒙教育、唯物史观教育、抗美援朝及增产节约的教育；同时，各企业在解放后就实行了民主改革，废除搜身、打骂及把头制度，基本上以批评和自我批评的方法，改造了旧的人事关系，建立了工厂职工代表会和管理委员会，实行了工厂管理民主化和各项生产改革。使残留在社会主义性质的国营企业内部的不合理制度，逐步肃清。私营企业由于人民政府颁布了各项劳动法令，经过了签订集体合同、劳资协商等方法，也相当地改善了工人的劳动条件；因而才有可能树立职工群众的国家主人翁思想和新的劳动态度。经验证明：如果忽视了经常的政治教育和企业管理的民主化，真正的劳动竞赛是不可能的。如果职工群众把参加国营企业的经营管理，不是当做自己的责任，而仅仅看做是一种权利，要实现工人阶级在国家建设中的领导作用，也是不可能的。因此，工会必须不断地组织职工进行经常的政治、文化、技术学习，积极学习经营管理，才能真正成为如列宁所说的管理的学校、经营的学校和共产主义的学校。
    第三、加强工会基层组织，才能实现工会的任务。
    工会的基层组织是工会的基础，是工会组织系统中最基本的环节。工会的全部工作都要通过和依靠基层组织来进行。上级工会必须面向基层，加强对基层组织的领导。
    东北工会的基层组织，在克服关门主义，特别是明确了工会应以发展生产为中心任务之后，有了发展和进步，也出现了一些先进的基层组织。但由于我们对基层组织建设的重要意义认识不足，和领导上的不深入，以致一般的基层组织，至今仍未很好地建立起全面的和经常的工作，工会的组织作用很薄弱，因而极大地影响了工会工作的进展。
    健全工会基层的组织，就是健全基层工会委员会、车间委员会和小组的工作。基层工会的各种工作委员会必须按照实际需要，结合当前工作任务逐步建立，否则，必然是形式主义的。所有工会工作者均应依靠职工群众，密切关心和认真解决群众生产和生活中的问题，培养积极分子，建立工作制度，才能使组织逐渐健全，发挥工会的组织作用。
    中共中央东北局城市工作会议后，各省、市产业工会开始有了自己的典型基层组织，负责干部开始深入工厂、车间，这些经验，必须推广并坚持下去。只有健全基层组织，工会的一切工作才能真正贯彻，和群众的联系才能加强。
    第四、依靠党的领导，在国营企业中和行政、青年团团结一致地进行工作。
    党是工人阶级组织的最高形式，党的领导是我们工作取得成绩的可靠保证。各级工会均应在同级党委的领导下工作，每个工会工作者必须认真地研究和宣传党的政策、指示、文件，并切实地组织执行，以便把广大职工群众紧密地团结在党的周围，使工会真正成为党联系工人阶级的纽带。任何把工会和党并列起来的想法、作法都是错误的。
    国营企业是社会主义性质的企业，在这里，工会和企业行政方面的立场、基本任务是一致的，彼此间完全不应该有磨擦，所谓彼此立场不同的观点是根本错误的。因此，对企业中的各项工作，工会必须在党的领导下和行政方面及青年团求得认识一致和步调协调，又有明确分工。对带有原则性的问题，有不同意见时，应展开讨论；目的是弄清问题，求得意见一致。日常事务则应互相协商，求得解决。要在互相关心、互相帮助和批评自我批评的基础上，造成团结工作的环境，以便从各方面为实现国家的经济计划而工作，彻底肃清互相对立和各搞一套的思想。
    这就是我们在工会工作中三年来所体会到的一些基本认识。这是在今后的工作中还必须继续加以贯彻的。
    东北工会今后的任务和工作应该是怎样的呢？
    抗美援朝的伟大斗争，必须继续进行到敌人愿意和平解决的时候为止。我们必须坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，进一步增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军，争取抗美援朝的最后胜利。
    东北经济经过了几年的恢复和发展，使我们有条件在今年就开始进行有重点的有步骤的大规模的经济建设。这就是进一步增强我们的经济力量和国防力量，以迎接即将到来的全国大规模的经济建设高潮。这是东北工人阶级当前的主要任务和对全国人民所负的责任。
    全东北的职工必须继续努力，深入开展增产节约运动，无限地发挥企业内部的潜力，改进企业的经营管理，大力推广先进生产经验和先进工作方法，以提高劳动生产率，更多地积累建设资金；同时必须努力提高职工的政治、文化、技术水平，培养大批有政治觉悟、有文化、业务、技术知识的干部，来迎接大规模的经济建设。随着经济建设的发展，工人阶级的物质和文化生活必将逐渐提高。
    东北的党组织和东北人民政府已给我们定出了一九五二年的生产、财务、技术计划。按计划规定，东北工业的生产总值今年比去年提高百分之四十点三，劳动生产率在国营企业提高百分之十五，地方企业提高百分之二十。
    全东北职工将热烈地展开一个讨论国家计划的运动，通过群众讨论，制订出本厂矿、本车间、本小组和个人的先进的增产节约计划，或爱国竞赛公约，做为奋斗目标，以便为国家创造和节约更大的财富。
    目前增产节约的重点，在工业部所属厂矿是：继续改善车间技术管理和生产管理，以提高设备运用率和产品质量；加强车间成本管理，做到多数车间实行成本核算。在基本建设方面是：加强设计，做好准备工作，合理组织劳动力，保证质量，加速工程进程。在地方工业是：充分运用现有潜力，贯彻经济核算制。在国营贸易系统是：扩大和加速商品流转，降低商品流转费用。在交通运输系统是：缩短周转率，加强运输中的计划性与纪律性。在机关和文化教育部门是：进行思想改造，提高工作效率，厉行精简节约。在所有部门，都要展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义作风的群众运动。私营企业职工也应倡导节约，保证产品质量，反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗骗国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报，努力引导资方把一切可用的资金用于扩大工业生产，并为城乡物资交流服务。
    为了达到以上要求，需要做好以下工作：
    一、全面深入地开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，大力推广生产中的先进经验。
    爱国主义劳动竞赛，是使职工在生产中落后的赶上先进的、先进的更提高一步、以达到全面提高和不断提高的方法。增产节约必须以生产计划为基础，依靠广大职工，形成轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动，才能达到目的。全体职工应加强政治学习，认清增产节约的积极意义，了解增产节约不是一时的运动，而是逐步实现国家工业化和改善劳动人民生活的基本方法；因此，应该反对保守思想，纠正自满情绪和凑任务的观点。技术人员和职员应积极展开一个自我教育和自我改造的运动，树立坚定的为人民服务的思想，肃清旧社会的思想作风，克服对工作只从个人兴趣出发、轻视工人实际经验、不深入现场和不安心工作的毛病。如果人人都能把自己的劳动和共产主义的伟大事业联系起来，那么，我们的竞赛就有了坚固的思想基础，就必然会把增产节约运动变成东北工人阶级经常的战斗任务。
    竞赛中应特别重视改进技术、改良工具和改进劳动组织的先进经验。各种先进经验的推广，必将为国家带来巨大的财富，和从群众工作到生产管理工作的一系列的改进。因此，总结和推广生产中的先进经验应成为目前竞赛的中心内容，这是提高劳动生产率的主要方法。
    先进经验是到处存在的，问题在于认真地总结和有计划地推广。推广先进经验，要特别抓紧有决定意义的经验，如煤矿系统中的新式采煤法、快速掘进法和施玉海安全生产经验，机械系统中的高速切削法和多刀多刃切削法，建筑业中的苏长有砌砖法，铁路系统的超轴运动、五百公里运动和李锡奎调车法，被服业中的姜万寿经验，和早已推行的马恒昌小组经验等。应学习纺织系统推广“郝建秀工作法”和“一九五一织布工作法”的经验，大张旗鼓地，有计划、有组织地推广。要大胆提倡群众的首创精神，建立起领导合理化建议的组织，反对不重视群众创造以及把先进经验埋没起来的保守思想和官僚主义作风。我们的报纸应成为传播先进经验的讲坛。
    每个产业，每个工厂，每个车间和每个生产小组，必须创造和学习一种到数种有决定意义的先进经验，改进自己的生产工作。注意帮助生产上落后的单位和落后的职工，组织他们学习先进经验，这是每个先进工人和先进单位的社会义务。这就是为了整体发展而帮助落后者的共产主义原则。
    各级工会应大力组织工人的技术学习，整顿技术学习组织，建立车间的技术研究会，帮助工人更好地使用设备，节省工时，节约原材料，推动工人找窍门并提出合理化建议，创造更多的和更先进的工作方法。应帮助工人通晓技术操作规程，并以遵守操作规程为主，建立起严格的自觉的劳动纪律。操作规程不完备的单位应通过表演、综合和训练，使制定和贯彻操作规程成为劳动和技术相结合的运动。
    各级工会应进行广泛的定额教育，领导职工帮助行政方面制定进步的技术定额，反对保守思想，并帮助工人达到和超过定额。政府规定的工资政策，必须组织职工讨论贯彻。特别是计件工资和计时奖励制，是推动工人学习技术的杠杆，是竞赛的物质基础，工会应结合生产，积极协助企业行政推行。争取今年有百分之五十到六十的在籍生产工人实行计件工资。在推行计件工资制中，特别要注意和照顾老技术工人，使他们的工资收入能够合理。要努力帮助他们，发挥他们的作用，有计划地逐渐地把他们提拔到管理生产、指导生产的岗位上来。
    工会必须更广泛地引导青年工人参加竞赛，努力帮助青年工人学习技术，关心并改善他们的文化生活的设施；注意女工的劳动保护工作，有系统地提高她们的生产熟练程度。
    竞赛的组织领导必须加强。要巩固小组爱国竞赛公约、联系合同和推广集体合同，展开小组的、车间的竞赛，并逐渐发展到厂矿间的竞赛。为了加强竞赛的领导，各厂矿竞赛中的重大问题都应提交管理委员会讨论和决定，工会应负起直接组织的责任，进行经常的群众性的检查、评判、总结和奖励，克服目前某些工会组织听任运动自流和满足于一般号召和表面的轰轰烈烈的官僚主义作风。所有工会干部要深入车间发现问题、解决问题，推动竞赛前进，并使竞赛和企业中新的经营管理制度相结合，逐渐成为职工的日常的劳动生活。
    目前竞赛的发展是不平衡的，因此，各厂矿职工必须在学习先进厂矿竞赛经验的同时，照顾本产业的特点和原有的工作基础，并且要发挥自己的创造性，找出适合自己的特点的竞赛形式，以便达到增产节约的目的。
    必须立即展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争。这是一场新的有历史意义的革命斗争。没有这个斗争的胜利，我们增产节约的劳动成果，国家的建设资金就会被大量盗窃和浪费，不少的干部、工作人员会被腐蚀和毁灭。无数的事实证明：许多的资产阶级不法分子不仅以其腐化堕落的思想来侵蚀战斗的工人阶级，拉走某些动摇分子，甚至派人打入我国家机关、国营企业和经济部门，以盗窃国家财产。这场斗争的本质，是反对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的斗争，是对违法的资产阶级分子向工人阶级猖狂进攻的坚决反击。在这场严重的阶级斗争中，我们必须取得胜利。因此，所有贪污浪费和官僚主义分子应当立即坦白，广大的工人、职员群众应该勇敢地检举，以便大批地肃清贪污、浪费和官僚主义的现象。
    私营企业中的职工，尤应大胆地揭露资方的行贿、盗窃国家财富的罪行，提高自己的阶级觉悟，肃清资产阶级的思想影响，分清劳资界限，并监督资方认真执行国家的政策法令，使私营企业在有利于国计民生的轨道上，获得进一步的发展。
    二、工会应密切关心职工的生活，并努力做到可能的改善。
    目前中心的问题是增加生产，厉行节约，但同时必须经常关心职工生活，并努力做到可能的改善。如果对职工生活困难采取官僚主义态度，不仅脱离群众，而且影响职工生产的积极性。
    工会应协同行政方面坚决贯彻国家各项劳动保护法令，有计划地改进安全卫生设备，注意环境卫生，加强对职工的安全、卫生教育，以便消灭责任伤亡事故，逐渐减少职业病及一般疾病。应充分合理地使用劳动保险金和工厂奖励基金，加强劳动保险事业的管理，根据群众的需要，办好业余疗养所、劳保食堂，调整一般性的疗养院。工会应做好关于职工的生活居住工作，积极协助企业行政方面改善工人食堂和厂矿的医疗、卫生工作，以增进职工健康水平。应增加托儿所和幼儿园，建议行政方面根据国家投资增修简易工人住宅，并建议市人民政府改善工人住宅区的交通状况及市政设施，推动国营商店和合作社改善对于职工的供应状况，保证日用必需品的质量，以便利职工。
    工会应广泛组织职工的互助事业，发扬职工间的阶级友爱，提倡互相帮助解决困难。工会会费中百分之二十的救济金，应用以救济困难工友，不应因为钱少而搁置不用。要做好家属互助的工作，提高职工家属的觉悟，管好家务。
    工会是职工群众自己的组织，工会负责干部必须要善于“处身于工人生活之内，知道这生活的各方面，善于在任何时机，对任何问题都能正确无讹地判定群众底情绪及其实际意图、需要和思想，善于不带半点虚伪观念，明白确定群众的觉悟程度以及某种旧成见或旧思想残余对群众的影响，善于用同志态度去对待群众，关心地满足群众要求，这样来争取群众的无限信仰。”（列宁）我们各级工会的干部一定要这样做，才能逐渐使工会真正成为职工生活的领导者和组织者，才能更好地领导工人发挥无限的创造力量。
    三、加强工人业余教育，培养工人干部。
    为了胜利完成增产节约计划，和为大规模的经济建设准备人才，全体职工均应努力提高自己的政治、文化和技术水平。随着工人阶级队伍的扩大，帮助和提高新职工的政治、文化、技术水平，也是我们共同的责任。
    今年，要组织职工群众普遍参加各级党委所领导的关于共产主义和共产党的学习，使职工对共产主义和共产党有一个基本认识。准备在三、五年左右基本消灭现有产业工人和一般固定工人中的文盲。除组织工人在实际操作中提高技术外，还要组织初等学校以上文化程度的工人进行系统的技术知识的学习。
    为此，首先要使职工充分认识参加业余学习的意义，自觉地参加学习。其次，工会必须重视这一政治任务，在党委领导下定出统一的业余学习的具体计划，协同有关方面切实解决教材问题，聘请优秀职工担任教员；在文化学习组织中并应有一定数量的专职教员。必须保证学习时间，在较大企业中可成立职工业余学校，统一领导职工的政治、文化、技术学习，重大的问题应交工厂管理委员会讨论决定。职工业余学习的领导，必须从职工的要求和厂矿的实际情况出发，主观主义、急于求成或片面强调正规化的思想都是必然要失败的。
    为了培养大批的职工干部，要办好东北工会干部学校（即东北工人政治大学）和各省市工会的训练班。应该有计划地派送优秀职工到工农速成中学和技术学校去学习。
    在各企业中，应尽可能地建立车间俱乐室，建立流动图书箱，组织群众性的文化体育活动。广播台、黑板报、电影都应成为工会进行政治教育、生产宣传、联系群众和鼓舞群众积极性的武器。
    四、加强工会组织建设，改进领导作风。
    为了完成工会的任务，必须健全工会组织，特别是基层组织。继续推广“五三”厂等先进基层组织的工作经验，有计划地训练干部，使工会干部明确认识工会的性质、任务和工会工作的做法。在今后
    一年左右，要求一般厂矿工会基本上做到：一、建立起定期的计划工作、检查工作、汇报情况、学习文件和研究工作的制度；二、定期召开小组会和车间生产会议；三、定期向会员报告工作、报告经费、听取群众批评。
    必须加强车间委员会的工作。车间委员会应该密切结合增产节约运动的要求，组织生产会议，培养先进小组。工会各种组织中应有党委、行政方面及青年团中担任相当工作的干部参加。这既便于配合工作，又能发挥工会的组织作用。
    东北总工会和省、市级工会应认真地提高自己领导工作和组织工作的水平，改变领导作风，取消那些不解决问题的会议和表报，精简办事手续，提高工作效率。所有工会干部，特别是领导干部，应深入基层，深入车间，具体地帮助下面解决问题。
    各产业工会应在地方工会领导下，着重解决生产、工资、劳动保护等产业的特殊问题，首先要做好调查研究和推广先进经验的工作。大城市中，为加强市总工会对分散的和私营企业基层组织的领导，得按情况设立市总工会的区办事处，但编制以精干为原则。
    工会工作要重点领导，但必须照顾全面。中心工作要和经常业务恰当地结合起来。要十分注意我们工作中发展的不平衡性；不要以局部的情况当做全体。完成我们光荣的任务，需要我们做巨大的努力。困难是会有的，但只要我们紧紧地依靠着党的领导，团结着广大的职工群众，我们就能够克服任何困难。工作中也可能发生错误和缺点，这就要求我们充分发扬民主，展开由下而上和由上而下的批评和自我批评；只要紧紧地掌握住这个工人阶级的战斗武器，我们的工作就会不断前进。
