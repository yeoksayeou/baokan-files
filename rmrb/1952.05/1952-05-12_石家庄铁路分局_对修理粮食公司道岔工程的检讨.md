Column: Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    On March 14th, the People's Daily's Reader's Letters column published a criticism from the Shijiazhuang Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation regarding our bureau's irresponsible handling of the siding repair project. After investigation, we believe that the opinions raised by the Shijiazhuang Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation are completely correct. Comrade Huo Yuzhi, the cadre in charge of this matter, was negligent in his work, which was the direct cause of this error. He did not personally go to the Shijiazhuang Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation to understand the transportation volume, but only inquired by telephone to the Shijiazhuang Freight Yard, and mistakenly wrote the monthly transportation volume as the annual transportation volume. Our bureau's leading cadres also have a bureaucratic work style. Although we held meetings to discuss this matter, we never discovered the error, which led to repeated mistakes. We reported to the Tianjin Railway Administration on December 7th of last year, requesting permission to suspend the repair of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation's dedicated line. However, after we discovered the error in the transportation volume, we made two consecutive requests to the higher authorities on December 15th and 28th to correct it. On February 22nd of this year, we received a notice from the Tianjin Railway Administration agreeing to build the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation's dedicated line, but this matter had already been delayed for more than two months. In this matter, we did not conduct conscientious and responsible investigation and research, thus delaying the state's basic construction project, which is a major error. In addition to deeply examining and correcting our mistakes, we have transferred personnel and allocated materials, and resumed work on April 5th to continue the construction of this siding project.

### 石家庄铁路分局  对修理粮食公司道岔工程的检讨

    石家庄铁路分局
    对修理粮食公司道岔工程的检讨
    编辑同志：三月十四日，人民日报读者来信栏内刊载了中国粮食公司石家庄分公司对我局修理道岔不负责任的批评。经过检查，我们认为中国粮食公司石家庄分公司所提意见是完全正确的。经办此事的干部霍誉之工作疏忽，是造成这种错误直接的原因。他不亲自去中国粮食公司石家庄分公司了解运量情况，只用电话向石家庄货场问了一下，就误将每月运量写成全年运量。我局领导干部也有官僚主义作风，我们虽然开会研究过这一件事，却始终没有发觉错误，以致一误再误。我们曾在去年十二月七日报告天津铁路管理局，要求准予停修中国粮食公司专用线。但在我们发现运量写错的情况后，就在十二月十五日、二十八日连续两次向上级请求改正。今年二月二十二日，我们接到天津铁路管理局同意修建中国粮食公司专用线的通知，但此事已经耽误了两个多月。在这件事情上，我们没有进行认真负责地调查研究，因而延误了国家基本建设工程，这是很大的错误。我们除了深刻检讨、纠正错误外，已抽调人员，调拨材料，在四月五日复工，继续修建这个道岔工程。    石家庄铁路分局
