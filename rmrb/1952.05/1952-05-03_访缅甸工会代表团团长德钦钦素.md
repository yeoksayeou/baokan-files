An Interview with Thakin Chit Maung, Head of the Burmese Trade Union Delegation

We interviewed Thakin Chit Maung, Head of the Burmese Trade Union Delegation and Secretary-General of the All-Burma Trade Union Congress, who was invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations.

Thakin Chit Maung first talked about the scene when they received the invitation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He said: "The Chinese people have finally won victory after more than 30 years of arduous revolutionary struggle. We are very honored to be able to come to China to participate in the 'May Day' celebrations. We believe that 'May Day' will make the world's peace forces stronger, and the unity of Chinese workers, Burmese workers, and workers all over the world will become more consolidated day by day."

Thakin Chit Maung then talked about his impressions after coming to China. They came to Guangzhou by train via Hong Kong, and then flew from Guangzhou to Beijing. He said that they received a warm and sincere welcome along the way. During the short train journey, he found that the liberated Chinese people consciously abide by public order and are very disciplined. He saw with his own eyes that passengers on the train took their favorite books and newspapers from the service desk with their tickets, and returned them on time after reading. He felt that this was completely different from the situation in capitalist countries where the masses are forced to obey orders. This was his first impression of New China.

Thakin Chit Maung briefly introduced the situation of the Burmese people's movement to defend world peace. He said: The Burmese people, regardless of religious belief, political views, or ethnic differences, are uniting to fight for world peace. Currently, a signature campaign to support the conclusion of a five-power peace pact is being carried out enthusiastically in factories, villages, and schools. Almost all factories have organizations of peace committees. The peace committees of various factories hold mass meetings to publicize the significance of the signature campaign. Their slogan is: Every worker must not only sign himself, but also mobilize at least five family members and friends to sign. The broad masses of Burmese workers and people participated in this signature campaign. The All-Burma Peace Congress, which is scheduled to be held in May, will review the strength of the Burmese people in defending world peace.

The Burmese people are extremely indignant at the crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare in Korea and China. Thakin Chit Maung told us that on March 19, trade union representatives from Rangoon, Hantawaddy, and Insein gathered to condemn the United States for using bacteriological weapons. They not only represented the will of more than 4,500 local trade union members to defend Asian and world peace, but also represented the just aspirations of the Burmese people.

Burmese workers know that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution was achieved under the leadership of the working class. Thakin Chit Maung said: "New China is like a bright star for Asian countries, pointing out a bright future for us. We are willing to use this visit to unite more closely with the Chinese working class. We Burmese workers deeply believe that by learning valuable struggle experience from the Chinese workers and uniting with the Chinese workers, we can liberate ourselves and strive for a new life."

    访缅甸工会代表团团长德钦钦素
    我们访问了应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的缅甸工会代表团团长、全缅工会大会秘书长德钦钦素。
    德钦钦素首先谈到他们接到中华全国总工会请柬时的情景。他说：“中国人民经过三十多年艰苦的革命斗争，终于获得了胜利。我们能够来中国参加‘五一’节观礼，感到非常荣幸。我们相信：‘五一’节将使世界和平的力量更加壮大起来，中国工人、缅甸工人和全世界工人的团结也将一天比一天巩固。”
    德钦钦素接着谈到他来中国后的观感。他们是经香港乘火车到广州，又从广州乘飞机到北京来的。他说，他们在一路上受到了热情而诚恳的欢迎。在短短的火车上的行程中，他发现解放了的中国人民十分自觉地遵守公共秩序，纪律性很强。他亲眼看见火车上的旅客凭票向服务台取阅自己所喜爱的书报，阅读后又按时送回。他觉得这和资本主义国家强迫群众遵守秩序的情况完全不同。这是他来到新中国的第一个印象。
    德钦钦素扼要地介绍了缅甸人民保卫世界和平运动的情况。他说：缅甸人民，不分宗教信仰，不分政治见解，不分种族差异，正在团结起来为世界和平而斗争。目前在工厂、农村和学校中，普遍热烈地进行着拥护缔结五大国和平公约的签名运动。差不多所有的工厂都有和平委员会的组织。各工厂的和平委员会召开群众大会，来宣传签名的意义。他们的口号是：每个工人不但要自己签名，并且至少要动员家属、亲友五人签名。广大的缅甸工人和人民参加了这一签名运动。准备在五月间召开的全缅和平代表大会，将要检阅缅甸人民保卫世界和平的力量。
    缅甸人民对于美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行，极为愤慨。德钦钦素告诉我们：在三月十九日，仰光、汉达瓦底、因盛三地的工会代表曾经集会，谴责美国使用细菌武器。他们不仅代表了当地四千五百多工会会员保卫亚洲和世界和平的意志，也代表了缅甸人民正义的愿望。
    缅甸工人知道：中国人民革命的胜利，是在工人阶级的领导下取得的。德钦钦素说：“新中国，对亚洲各国来说，无异一颗明亮的星，给我们指出了光明的前途。我们愿通过这次访问，和中国工人阶级更加亲密地团结起来。我们缅甸工人深深地相信，向中国工人学习宝贵的斗争经验，并和中国工人团结一致，我们就可以解放自己，争取新的生活。”
