　　We Guarantee to Fulfill the Patriotic Production Increase Competition Plan
    Agricultural Labor Model Lü Hongbin
    Worker brothers! The great "May Day" Labor Day has arrived again. The worker elder brothers are the pioneers in building socialism and communism. In the construction of the New China, the peasants, with the help of the worker brothers, have begun to embark on the road of organized collective labor, which has continuously improved agricultural production, and the peasants' lives are becoming happier day by day. In 1951, I used new farm tools such as the seven-inch walking plow and the Liberation-style waterwheel, and the yield per mu increased by 65 jin. This year, the agricultural production cooperative I lead plans to produce an average of 694 jin per mu, an increase of 279 jin per mu compared to last year. In order to realize this plan, we guarantee: to do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, deep plowing and fine harrowing, and early weeding of wheat. All 31 and a half mu of wheat in the cooperative have been weeded for the first time. Eleven mu of high-yield land were deeply plowed with heavy plows to a depth of seven to eight inches, and finely harrowed eight times. In addition to deep plowing, fine harrowing, and early weeding, this year we also responded to the government's call to dig wells for drought prevention. There were originally four water wells and four waterwheels. This year, three stone wells have been dug. Of the 65 mu of land in the cooperative, 50 mu can be guaranteed to be free from drought. In order to increase the yield per unit area, I will apply more fertilizer. I have already bought 4,000 jin of bean cake and cottonseed cake and 200 jin of fertilizer powder, which will be applied in spring and summer. We will use these as guarantees for increasing production. Now all the members of the cooperative are busy with spring planting and well digging. Our entire cooperative will certainly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" and guarantee the completion of the plan to increase the yield per unit area.

　　我们保证完成爱国增产竞赛计划
    农业劳动模范  吕鸿宾
    工人兄弟们！伟大的“五一”劳动节又到了。工人老大哥是建设社会主义和共产主义的先锋，在新中国的建设中，农民得到工人兄弟们的帮助，开始走上了组织起来集体劳动的道路，使农业生产不断地提高，农民的生活一天一天走向幸福。一九五一年俺使用了新式农具七英寸步犁和解放式水车，每亩地增产了六十五斤。今年俺领导的农业生产合作社计划每亩平均产六百九十四斤，比去年每亩增产二百七十九斤。为了实现这个计划，俺们保证：作好防旱抗旱，深耕细耙，早锄麦子。全社三十一亩半小麦，全部锄了头遍。十一亩丰产地用重犁深耕七寸到八寸，细耙耢八遍。除了深耕细耙早锄外，今年响应政府号召，还进行了打井防旱。原有水井四眼，水车四部，今年又打了石井三眼，全社六十五亩地，已有五十亩可以保证不受旱。为提高单位面积产量，俺要多施肥料，已买好豆饼和棉籽饼四千斤、肥田粉二百斤，准备在春夏二季施用。俺们增加生产就用这些做保证。现在全社社员正忙着春种、打井。俺们全社一定响应毛主席提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，保证完成提高单位面积产量的计划。（附图片）
