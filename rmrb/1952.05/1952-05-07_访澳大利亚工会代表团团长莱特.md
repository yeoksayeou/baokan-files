Interview with Wright, Head of the Australian Trade Union Delegation

Wright, the head of the Australian trade union delegation, and all the delegates who were invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations, told reporters that they were proud to be selected by the progressive trade union organizations of Australia to visit New China.

Wright said that the Australian working class is growing stronger along with the increasing strength of the world's forces for peace and democracy. They are waging an irreconcilable struggle against the right-leaning elements of the trade unions and the reactionary policies implemented by the ruling class, and are moving towards progress and victory day by day.

"Within the scope of capitalist countries, the living standards of Australian workers used to be relatively good," Wright said. "However, as a result of the ruling class's implementation of reactionary policies, workers' lives are rapidly deteriorating. Inflation is rampant, and prices are rising. Unemployment has already begun to occur, and strikes are spreading everywhere."

Wright spoke with confidence about the Australian people's sharp struggle to defend peace, saying: The Australian people once sent their representatives to the Paris Peace Conference in 1949, and last year sent 20 representatives to the Warsaw Peace Conference. The Peace Conference held in Melbourne in 1950 was attended by representatives of 800 people's organizations, and British Cardinal Archbishop Janson also came to participate in this grand event. Enthusiastic mass rallies were held in all states, demonstrating a powerful force for the defense of peace. Two hundred thousand people signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and another 130,000 people signed the request for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and the signature campaign is still continuing.

He said that the Australian people are now waging a resolute struggle against the ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty and the arming of Japan, because this measure, which violates the interests of the people and moves towards war, will bring profound disasters to the Australian people. The people clearly recognize this serious crisis, and a fighting organization including all strata of the country and all patriotic elements—the Committee Against Ratifying the Japanese Peace Treaty—unites the people of the whole country and roars with anger. The committee once sent 300 representatives to petition, all of whom traveled from as far as 150 miles away to Canberra, and the broad masses of the people signed their names to express their wishes. This boiling public opinion forced the reactionary newspapers and even the government to admit that the people were against ratifying the treaty, and only ratified it because of the insistence of the U.S. government. The signature campaign against the ratification of the Japanese Peace Treaty effectively strengthened and promoted the signature campaign to demand the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact, and the two combined pushed the Australian people's just movement for peace to a climax.

Wright said that the Australian people have always opposed the unjust war of aggression against Korea by U.S. imperialism with practical actions. When Prime Minister Menzies explained in the U.S. Congress that Australia had decided to send troops to Korea, Australia's progressive trade union organizations and independent newspapers protested angrily. Although the government, against the will of the people, sent a part of the air force and two battalions of infantry to participate in the bloody war of aggression against Korea, because this reactionary move was unpopular and the people were unwilling to be cannon fodder and executioners who would slaughter the peaceful people of Korea, the government has now been unable to recruit enough cannon fodder to replenish the personnel losses. The just call of the people to demand the withdrawal of troops from Korea resounds throughout the country, and even the recently deceased Labor Party leader Chifley and Labor Senator Cameron have made this demand. In the protest movement, the prestige of the Australian Communist Party and progressive forces among the people has greatly increased.

Wright said that the Australian people have always been friendly to the Chinese people. When the Japanese invaders invaded China in 1931, the Australian people always supported China and opposed Japanese imperialism. At that time, a strong anti-Japanese movement was launched in the country, and trade union organizations across the country took boycotting Japanese goods as a concrete action to support China, and workers in some industries held demonstrations and strikes. Bates, the chairman of the Australian Dockworkers' Union who is in the delegation, is one who personally participated in this action. They refused to transport strategic materials, especially steel, to Japan. These righteous actions were supported by the broad masses of the people. During World War II, some Chinese sailors were stranded in Australia, and Australian maritime workers took care of them with fraternal warmth. Baird, a representative of the delegation who is also present, personally participated in this matter. Now the Australian people's movement to demand the withdrawal of troops from Korea has put the government in an extremely embarrassing situation. The recruiting generals, in an attempt to deceive the people, even spread rumors saying: "China is about to invade Australia's New Guinea." The Australian people will never believe these lies, but instead have strengthened their unity and friendship with the Chinese people, and shattered the unbelievable slander. There is no doubt that people clearly realize from reality that the development of New China has only significant benefits for Australia and no harm whatsoever.

He said that the Australian people heard many new things about New China from the representatives who returned from the Berlin World Youth and Student Festival. Progressive trade union organizations showed the Chinese films "The White Haired Girl" and "Daughters of China" ("The White Haired Girl" was censored and the last part was deleted). These films made the Australian people realize that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution was not easy to come by. This great story of struggle is a realistic education for the Australian people.

The delegation has gained profound impressions since entering the territory of New China, especially after arriving in Beijing. Wright said with a happy smile: I have personally seen that the Chinese people are living such a happy life under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party. These facts have deeply moved us. The powerful strength of trade union organizations and various people's organizations not only occupies an important position in the new regime, but also has a profound influence in social life. New China, which is undergoing great construction, has achieved brilliant achievements in industry, agriculture, especially in railways and water conservancy. I believe that this is just a beginning, and even greater victories will come one after another.

Finally, Wright said that the Chinese people have achieved victory and happiness from a long and arduous struggle, and they know how to consolidate and develop their revolutionary achievements. Therefore, they have the most resolute desire for peace and also have the powerful strength to defend peace. We will bring back the Chinese people's unwavering determination to strive for lasting peace and convey it to the Australian people. (Wang Zhen) (Attached picture)

### 访澳大利亚工会代表团团长莱特

    访澳大利亚工会代表团团长莱特
    应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的澳大利亚工会代表团团长莱特和全体代表们对记者说：澳大利亚的进步工会组织选派他们到新中国参观，他们是感到自豪的。
    莱特说，澳大利亚工人阶级随着世界和平民主力量的日益强大而壮大起来。他们和工会的右倾分子及统治阶级所执行的反动政策进行不调和的斗争，正在一天天走向进步，走向胜利。
    “在资本主义国家的范畴内，过去澳大利亚工人的生活水平还算是较好的。”莱特说：“但是，统治阶级执行反动政策的结果，工人生活正在迅速地恶化中。通货膨胀，物价增高。失业现象已经开始发生，此起彼仆的罢工运动正在各地蔓延开来。”
    莱特满怀信心地谈起了澳大利亚人民为保卫和平而进行的尖锐斗争，他说：澳大利亚人民曾经派出自己的代表参加了一九四九年的巴黎和平大会，去年又派代表二十名参加了华沙和平会议。一九五○年在墨尔钵召开的和平大会，有八百个人民团体的代表参加，英国红衣大主教詹逊也赶来参与了这个盛会，全国各州都举行了热烈的群众集会，表现了强大的保卫和平的力量。在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名的达二十万人，又有十三万人在要求缔结五大国和平公约上签了名，而且签名运动仍在继续开展中。
    他说，现在澳大利亚人民正在为反对批准对日和约和武装日本展开了坚决的斗争，因为这种违反人民利益走向战争的措施，将给澳大利亚人民带来深重的灾祸。人民清楚地认识了这种严重的危机，一个包括全国各阶层和一切爱国分子的战斗组织——反对批准对日和约委员会，团结着全国人民，发出了愤怒的吼声。委员会曾经推派了三百名代表去请愿，所有的代表都从一百五十英里以外的远处赶到堪培拉，广大的人民都签名表示自己的意愿。这种沸腾的民意迫使反动报纸甚至政府也不得不承认人民是反对批准这个条约的，只是因为美国政府的坚持才不得不批准。反对批准对日和约的签名运动有力地加强和推动了要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动，两者结合起来，把澳大利亚人民争取和平的正义运动推向高潮。
    莱特说，澳大利亚人民始终以实际的行动反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的不义战争。当首相孟席斯在美国国会说明澳大利亚决定派兵赴朝后，澳大利亚的进步的工会组织和独立性报纸，愤怒地提出抗议。虽然政府违背民意，派出了一部分空军和两营步兵参加了血腥的侵朝战争，但是由于这个反动举措不得人心，人民不愿充当炮灰，充当残杀朝鲜和平人民的刽子手，现在政府已经无法征集足够的炮灰去补充缺额的兵员损失。人民强烈要求撤回侵朝军队的正义呼声响彻全国，连不久前逝世的工党领袖齐佛雷和工党参议员卡姆伦都提出了这个要求。在抗议运动中，澳大利亚共产党和进步力量在人民中间的威信大大提高了。
    莱特说，澳大利亚人民对中国人民从来就是友好的。在一九三一年日寇侵略中国时，澳大利亚人民就一直支持中国而反对日本帝国主义。当时在国内曾经掀起了强烈的反日运动，全国工会组织以抵制日货作为支援中国的具体行动，有些产业的工人举行了示威罢工。在座的代表团代表澳大利亚码头工人工会主席贝茨就是亲身参加这种行动的一个。他们拒运战略物资特别是钢铁到日本去。这些正义行动获得了广大人民的支持。第二次世界大战时期，曾经有一部分中国海员阻留在澳大利亚，澳大利亚海员工人兄弟般地热情地照顾他们，另一在座的代表团代表柏尔德就曾亲与其事。现在澳大利亚人民进行的要求从朝鲜撤兵的运动，迫使政府处于极为狼狈的境地。征兵的将军们妄图欺骗人民，竟至造谣说：“中国将要侵略澳大利亚的新几内亚。”澳大利亚人民决不相信这些鬼话，反而加强了和中国人民的团结、友谊，粉碎了使人难于置信的诬蔑。毫无疑问，人们从现实中清楚地体会到新中国的发展对澳大利亚只有重大的利益而无丝毫的危害。
    他说，澳大利亚人民从参加柏林世界青年与学生联欢大会归来的代表口中，听到了许多关于新中国的新事物。进步工会组织演出中国电影“白毛女”和“中华女儿”（“白毛女”被删割了最后一段）。这些电影使澳大利亚人民体会到中国人民革命的胜利得来非易。这种伟大的斗争故事，对澳大利亚人民是一个现实的教育。
    代表团踏进新中国的领土，特别到了北京以后，获得的各种印象是深刻的。莱特带着愉快的笑容说：我亲眼看到了中国人民在毛泽东主席和共产党领导下，过着那么愉快而幸福的生活。这些事实，使我们非常感动。工会组织和各种人民团体的强大力量，不但在新政权中占有重要的地位，而且在社会生活中具有深厚的影响。正在进行伟大建设的新中国，在工业农业特别是铁路和水利事业上，已经取得了辉煌的成就，我相信这还不过是一个开端，更伟大的胜利将一个接着一个到来。
    最后，莱特说，中国人民从长期艰苦的斗争中取得了胜利和幸福，他们是懂得如何去巩固和发展他们的革命成果的。因此他们具有最坚决的和平愿望，也有强大的力量来保卫和平。我们将把中国人民坚定不渝的争取持久和平的意志带回去传达给澳大利亚人民。（王真）（附图片）
