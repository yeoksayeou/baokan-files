    We Have Achieved Results in Piloting Painless Childbirth

    Editor: We have been experimenting with the Soviet painless childbirth method, and have achieved success in fourteen out of fifteen cases. We are now sharing our experiences for the reference of obstetrical staff and expectant mothers in various regions.

    When we started the experiment, many of our obstetrics colleagues had some fixed ideas, believing that: countless mothers have suffered pain during childbirth, how could a few lessons make it painless! But after the experiment, it was indeed successful. Since then, the doctors have gradually gained confidence in the Soviet painless childbirth method.

    According to Soviet experience, one of the main keys to painless childbirth is that the mother must have a high degree of trust in the doctors, midwives, and nurses. We have shortcomings in this regard. Before our department experimented with the Soviet painless childbirth method, there had been several accidents, so mothers expressed doubts about us as soon as they were admitted to the hospital. However, because we took care of the mothers in every possible way, they gradually trusted us.

    Although the Soviet painless childbirth method is very simple, it must be meticulously executed. We have personally experienced that: do not be afraid that mothers lack confidence in painless childbirth, it is inevitable that mothers initially do not believe in painless childbirth, because the "inevitable pain during childbirth" is an old concept that has existed for thousands of years, and it is impossible to completely break it in a short period of time. As long as we explain more to the mothers, or let them see the actual situation, they will believe it. The entire delivery room must be quiet and pleasant, avoid being rushed; when individual mothers experience pain or other unexpected phenomena during childbirth, they should be isolated, or the reasons for the event should be explained to other mothers. After the mother enters the delivery room, the midwife and doctor must never leave the delivery room, so as to avoid suspicion from the mother. The one case where we failed was because we did not pay enough attention to this point. Special attention should be paid to the wording used, as words like "contractions" are likely to increase the mother's ideological concerns. Attention should be paid to training nurses; if a nurse stammers when a mother asks questions about painless childbirth, it will increase the mother's suspicion. Using women who have already given birth using the painless childbirth method to conduct propaganda and education for expectant mothers is one of the most effective ways to promote painless childbirth.

    Painless childbirth is indeed the best method of childbirth. We believe that the obstetrics departments of various hospitals should focus on experimenting with and promoting it.

### 我们试行无痛分娩法有成绩

    我们试行无痛分娩法有成绩
    编辑同志：我们进行了苏联无痛分娩法的试验，在十五次中，就有十四次获得成功。现在把我们的经验告诉大家，以供各地产科人员和产妇参考。
    在开始试验时，我们产妇科好些同志都有一些固定的想法，认为：成千累万的产妇分娩时都免不了疼痛，那有给产妇上几次课，就会不痛了的事！但是经过试验，果然成功了。自此以后，大夫们对苏联无痛分娩法就渐渐有了信心。
    根据苏联的经验，无痛分娩法的主要关键之一，是要产妇对大夫、助产士、护士有高度的信赖。在这一点上，我们是有缺陷的。我科在试验苏联无痛分娩法以前，曾经发生过几次事故，所以产妇一入院，就对我们表示怀疑。但是由于我们处处体贴产妇，她们也就渐渐信赖我们了。
    苏联的无痛分娩法虽然很简单，但要处处作得精细。我们切身体验到：不要怕产妇对无痛分娩法没有信心，产妇起初不相信无痛分娩法是难免的，因为“分娩时必然发生疼痛”是千百年来的老观念，是不可能在很短的时间里完全打破的。只要我们向产妇多作解释，或让她们看看实际情况，她们就会相信了。整个产房的空气必须安静和愉快，切忌忙忙乱乱；个别的产妇在分娩时发生疼痛或其他意外的现象时，要予以隔离，或向其他产妇说明事情发生的原因。产妇进产房后，助产士、大夫绝对不许离开产房，免得产妇多疑。我们失败的一例，就是因为我们对这一点注意得不够。说话用词要特别留意，像“阵痛”一类语汇是容易增加产妇的思想顾虑的。要注意训练护士，当产妇询问无痛分娩法的问题时，护士支支吾吾答不出来，就会增加产妇的怀疑。利用曾经实行无痛分娩法分娩的妇人向产妇进行宣传教育，是推行无痛分娩法最有效的一个方法。
    无痛分娩法的确是分娩的最好方法，我们认为，各医院的产妇科应该有重点地试验推行。
