Xinhua News Agency, 27th dispatch: According to a TASS report: The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the German peace treaty issue on the 24th has aroused great attention from people in various European countries.

    The German Democratic Republic's state news agency, Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro (ADN), broadcast the full text of the Soviet note on the 25th. On the same day, all radio stations in the German Democratic Republic broadcast the full text of the note. "Tribune," the organ of the Free German Trade Union Federation, "Vorwärts," "Nacht-Express" (published in West Berlin), and all other democratic newspapers in Berlin published the Soviet note on the front page with large headlines.

    In Czechoslovakia and Romania, which had suffered greatly from German Nazis, radio stations repeatedly broadcast the full text of the Soviet note on the 25th. The people of both countries unanimously and warmly welcomed this document, considering it another significant contribution by the Soviet Union to the peaceful resolution of the German question.

    In France, the French Communist Party's newspaper "Dimanche Soir" reported on the Soviet note on the 25th under the headline "Soviet Union Demands Immediate Negotiations on the German Question" on the front page, and emphasized the great significance of the Soviet Union's specific proposals for establishing a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. Agence France-Presse (AFP), the French bourgeois news agency, also broadcast a summary of the Soviet note.

    In Britain, Reuters issued a summary of the Soviet note, and London Radio also broadcast reports about the Soviet note several times.

    The attention and support of the people of various European countries for the Soviet note made the US, British and French authorities deeply uneasy. According to New York radio, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France are studying the Soviet note. The US State Department has so far refused to issue an official comment on the Soviet note.

    欧洲各国人民拥护苏联关于对德和约照会
    一致认为这是苏联对和平解决德国问题的又一重大贡献
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社报道：苏联政府在二十四日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会，引起了欧洲各国人士的极大注意。
    德意志民主共和国的国家通讯社德意志通讯社在二十五日广播了苏联照会的全文。同日，德意志民主共和国的一切无线电台都全文广播了这个照会。自由德国工会机关报“论坛报”、“前进报”、“每夜快报”（在西柏林出版）及柏林其他一切民主报纸，都在第一页以大字标题刊登了苏联的照会。
    在饱受德国纳粹之害的捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚，广播电台在二十五日一再广播了苏联照会的全文。两国人民一致热烈欢迎这个文件，认为是苏联对和平解决德国问题的另一个重大贡献。
    在法国，法国共产党的报纸“星期日晚报”二十五日在首页以“苏联要求立即谈判德国问题”为题，报道了苏联的照会，并且强调指出苏联提出建立统一、独立、民主与爱好和平的德国的具体建议之重大意义。法国资产阶级的通讯社法新社，也摘要广播了苏联的照会。
    在英国，路透社播发了苏联照会的摘要，伦敦电台也把关于苏联照会的报道广播了好几次。
    欧洲各国人士对苏联照会的重视和拥护，使得美、英、法当局深感不安。据纽约广播，美、英、法三国外交部长正在研究苏联的照会。美国国务院到现在仍然拒绝对苏联照会发表正式评论。
