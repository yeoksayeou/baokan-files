    Shanxi Wenshui County Bei Hu Jia Bu Village Cadres Seriously Violate Marriage Law and Infringe Upon Human Rights
    Editor: Hao Guizhi, a woman from Xigu Village, Qingyuan County, Shanxi Province, was arranged by her mother to marry Zhang Mingze in Bei Hu Jia Bu Village, Wenshui County. After the marriage, she and her husband had disagreements and were often beaten and scolded. Last winter, she filed for divorce with the village people's government, which mediated. But she continued to be abused afterwards. On March 24th of this year, she again requested a divorce from the village people's government. The village people's government referred her to the Third District People's Government for resolution. Hao Guizhi, carrying a letter of introduction from the village people's government, went to the district people's government accompanied by her uncle, Ma Sanqing (from Xinbao Village, Third District). The Third District People's Government approved her divorce, but due to property issues, the case could not be finalized that day, and they agreed to meet again the next day. When Hao Guizhi and her uncle returned to Bei Hu Jia Bu Village, Wang Chengding, the village armed committee member and militia captain, gathered village militia and hooligans Li Shaotang, Wang Bingyin, and others to surround Ma Sanqing, verbally abuse him, and cause a disturbance. That evening, Hao Guizhi arranged for her uncle Ma Sanqing to stay at her aunt's house. Wang Chengding, Wang Xinqu and others, under the pretext of "checking household registrations," sent militia to tie Ma Sanqing to the village office, forcing Ma Sanqing to sign a "confession" admitting that "it was wrong to lead his niece to the district to get a divorce." The next morning, Zhang Mingze, along with Wang Chengding, Li Shaotang, and Lai Fuze, found Hao Guizhi and forced her to sign a statement saying "never to divorce," and pressed her fingerprint on it. Hao Guizhi, driven to desperation, attempted suicide by jumping into a water vat, but was fortunately discovered and rescued.
    Such acts of violating the Marriage Law and openly abusing women are intolerable. We hope that relevant parties will promptly investigate and deal with this matter.

    山西文水县北胡家堡村干部严重违反婚姻法侵犯人权
    编辑同志：山西省清源县西谷村妇女郝桂枝，曾由母亲包办，和文水县北胡家堡张明则结婚。结婚后，她和丈夫感情不合，常遭打骂。去年冬天，她向村人民政府提出离婚要求，曾经村人民政府调解。但以后她仍受虐待。今年三月二十四日，她又向村人民政府要求离婚。村人民政府介绍她到第三区人民政府去解决。郝桂枝拿着村人民政府的介绍信，由舅父马三庆（第三区新堡村人）伴同去区人民政府。第三区人民政府批准她离婚，但因财产问题，当天不能结案，便约好第二天再去。当郝桂枝和舅父返回北胡家堡村时，村武装委员兼民兵队长王成丁等竟纠集了村里的民兵及二流子李少堂、王丙寅等多人，把马三庆围住，横加辱骂，打闹。当晚，郝桂枝把舅父马三庆安置在她姨母家住下。王成丁、王新渠等，又借“查户口”为名，派民兵把马三庆捆到村公所，逼着马三庆具结“悔过”，承认“引外甥女到区上离婚是错误的”。第二天早上，张明则又和王成丁、李少堂、来福则找到郝桂枝，强迫她具结“永远不离婚”，并按了手印。郝桂枝被逼得走头无路，便钻水瓮自杀，幸被人发觉救起。
    这种违反婚姻法、公开虐害妇女的罪行，是令人不能容忍的。我们希望有关方面迅速检查处理这件事。　王孝举　余志坚
