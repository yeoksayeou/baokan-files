    Organizing to Listen to the "Domestic and International Events" Broadcast is a Good Way to Strengthen Current Affairs Learning

    Editor: We suggest that all organizations arrange for comrades who cannot read newspapers to listen to the "Domestic and International Events" broadcast by the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station, as this will help them in their current affairs learning.

    Many comrades are constantly engaged in mass work (as pointed out in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 26 regarding cadres of mass organizations in Beijing's 16th district). In various movements, they are the organizers and propagandists of the masses. Because of their low educational level, they have difficulty reading newspapers and know little about domestic and international events or the policies of the Party and the People's Government, which affects their work to a greater or lesser extent. According to our understanding, this is a common problem in some grassroots units.

    The "Domestic and International Events" broadcast by the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station every morning from 7:55 to 8:15 can help these comrades solve the difficulty of reading newspapers. Therefore, we suggest that all organizations pay attention to organizing them to listen to the broadcast on time. This is also one of the ways to strengthen cadres' current affairs learning.

    组织收听“国内外大事”广播是加强时事学习的好方法
    编辑同志：我们建议各机关组织不能阅读报纸的同志们收听北京人民广播电台播送的“国内外大事”，这对他们的时事学习是会有帮助的。
    有许多同志是经常作群众工作的（如四月二十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏内所指出的北京市十六区群众团体的干部），在各种运动中，都是群众的组织者和宣传鼓动者。他（她）们因为文化水平不高，看报有困难，就对国内外大事、党和人民政府的政策知道得很少，使工作或多或少受到了影响。据我们了解，这在某些基层单位中是一个普遍存在的问题。
    北京人民广播电台每天早晨七时五十五分到八时十五分播送的“国内外大事”，正可以帮助这些同志解决阅读报纸的困难。因此我们建议各机关注意组织他（她）们按时收听广播。这也是加强干部时事学习的方法之一。
