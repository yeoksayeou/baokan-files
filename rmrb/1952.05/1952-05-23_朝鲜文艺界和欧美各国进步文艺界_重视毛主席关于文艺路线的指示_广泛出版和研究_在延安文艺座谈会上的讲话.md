    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd — Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has had a profound impact on the Korean literary and art circles. On the tenth anniversary of Chairman Mao's speech, the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Literary Arts Organizations, accepting the request of the broad masses of Korean literary and art workers, is preparing to republish the Korean translation of this speech.
    As early as December 1945, Hamgyeongnam-do, Korea, published the Korean translation of Chairman Mao's speech. In April and May 1946, the Federation of Literary Arts Organizations successively organized study and discussion meetings on Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," with 40 to 50 people participating each time. Frequent participants included writers Han Seol-ya, Kim Sa-ryang, Jeon Jae-gyeong, Choi Myeong-ik, critic Ahn Ham-gwang, poet Lee Chan, playwright Han Tae-cheon, and many others. They unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's speech solved the fundamental direction problem of people's literary and art construction. At that time, the Federation of Literary Arts Organizations, guided by General Kim Il-sung's instructions, the Soviet literary and art policy, and Chairman Mao's literary and art speeches, called on all literary and art workers to go deep into the masses, understand and reflect the life, thoughts, and feelings of the working people, and create popular works for the people.
    Chairman Mao's speech also had a profound and widespread impact in the southern half of Korea. In August 1946, the Department of Chinese Literature at Seoul University translated Chairman Mao's speech into Korean and published it. According to Bae Ho, an assistant professor in the Department of Chinese Literature at Seoul University who was engaged in literary and art work in Seoul at the time, after the "August 15th" Japanese surrender, a wave of studying Chairman Mao's literary and art policies was launched in South Korean literary and art circles. Subsequently, with the brutal suppression of the democratic movement by the American-Lee gang, revolutionary literary and art workers went underground and established a literary and art research society. The literary and art research society used Chairman Mao's speech as a textbook and organized lectures. Even now, Chairman Mao's literary and art speeches are still circulating in the vast guerrilla areas of South Korea.
    Recently, a new study movement has been launched in Korean literary and art circles. The Federation of Literary Arts Organizations mobilized a large number of writers, poets, playwrights, and painters to go to the troops, factories, and rural areas to experience life, transform their thinking, engage in creation, and assist in the literary and art activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers. During the study movement, many Korean literary and art workers, while studying General Kim Il-sung's speeches to literary and art workers, re-studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Many literary and art workers wrote to the Federation of Literary Arts Organizations, requesting the reprinting of the translation of Chairman Mao's speech. The Central Committee of the Federation of Literary Arts Organizations has decided to reprint the translation of this document. Lee Tae-jun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Literary Arts Organizations, said: Through in-depth study of General Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao's speeches on literary and art issues and practical training in the new study movement, Korean literary and art workers will surely create more and better works. In particular, the reprinting of the Korean translation of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" will have a great guiding role for both writers and critics.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 22nd — Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in May 1942 has received attention from progressive literary and art circles in Western Europe and the Americas. Many progressive newspapers and publishing houses have published Chairman Mao's speech, and progressive writers have seriously studied the great significance of this speech.
    In France, "Pierre Seghers" Publishing House published the French translation of this speech in October 1949, just when the Government of the People's Republic of China had just announced its establishment. The editor introduced at the beginning of the translation: "Mao Zedong's essay in this book was published a long time ago, but it still plays a guiding role in the current Chinese revolution, cultural movement, and the direction of literature and art in the new China. The clear instructions made by Mao Zedong in the essay have been followed and affirmed in the recent meetings of artists and writers in China." This separate edition published by "Pierre Seghers" Publishing House was quickly sold out. This version has circulated to Italy and Latin American countries, and most of the Spanish and Portuguese translations are based on the French translation.
    The Italian Communist Party's theoretical magazine "Rinascita" and the mass weekly "Vie Nuove" have both published Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" published by the Italian Communist Party also contains the full text of this speech. Later, the Italian Communist Party Publishing Bureau printed this speech into a separate edition, which was immediately sold out after publication. The separate edition has now been published in three editions.
    In England, the "Modern Quarterly" Volume 4, Issue 1, published by the British Communist Party, contained a translation of Chairman Mao's speech. Progressive literary and art groups in the United Kingdom have repeatedly discussed this speech at gatherings, and many literary critics have repeatedly cited Chairman Mao's incisive insights on the people's literary and art line in their essays. Now, the British progressive publishing community is waiting for the official English translation of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and they will republish Chairman Mao's speech in the United Kingdom based on the official translation.
    In Sweden, "Månadens Bok" published an abstract of Chairman Mao's speech. Finland has also issued a Swedish translation of the extract, which has been highly valued by progressive literary and art circles in Sweden and Finland.
    In the United States, International Publishers published a separate edition of this speech in 1950. Prior to this, the New York "Daily Worker" had also published an abridged translation of the speech. Progressive literary and art workers in New York had studied and discussed the translation manuscript before the separate edition was published. The principles of going to the masses and to the struggle, and the requirement that revolutionary literature and art serve politics, proposed by Chairman Mao, are particularly meaningful to American literary and art workers. American famous writer and peace fighter Howard Fast expressed that he was deeply moved by Chairman Mao's speech. He said: "This speech opened up a new path for me, making us see the new factors of our time that made the United States and today's China produce such literary and artistic problems." Syren, editor of the progressive literary magazine "Masses & Mainstream," said: "Mao Zedong's speech is a good weapon for us Americans. It helps us to fight against the bourgeois decadent thinking that has infected so many American writers. In capitalist America, there are capitalist pressures in all aspects, one of the main pressures is to prevent writers from depicting workers. One of our main tasks is to unite writers and artists with the working class. Mao Zedong pointed out this central issue incisively. We feel that his words are an inspiration in our daily struggle for peace and world justice." Brown, a young black writer who recently traveled across the United States, said: "During this trip, I had discussions with many writers in many places, especially on the Pacific coast. In these discussions, I found that Mao Zedong's views made a deep impression. Those young writers and artists often quoted Mao Zedong's words. They are all trying to find their place in the working class, so you can imagine how much help Mao Zedong has given them ideologically."
    Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has also been introduced to Latin American countries. The Brazilian Communist Party's theoretical magazine "Para Todos" and the Cuban progressive magazine "Fundamentos" both published translations of this speech in 1951. The famous Brazilian poet and Stalin International Peace Prize winner Jorge Amado, who recently visited New China, said: "The path illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought followed by the Chinese literary and art circles is also the path taken by the Brazilian literary and art circles in the struggle for peace and against American imperialism." The famous Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén, who visited our country with Amado, also said: "Mao Zedong's speech is a very valuable document in the concept of people's literature serving the people."

    朝鲜文艺界和欧美各国进步文艺界
    重视毛主席关于文艺路线的指示
    广泛出版和研究“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，对朝鲜文艺界产生了极深刻的影响。在毛主席发表这个讲话十周年纪念的时候，朝鲜文学艺术总同盟中央委员会接受朝鲜广大文艺工作者的请求，正着手重新出版这一讲话的朝鲜文译本。
    早在一九四五年十二月，朝鲜咸镜南道就出版了毛主席这个讲话的朝鲜文译本。一九四六年四、五月间，文学艺术总同盟连续组织了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话的学习讨论会，每次都有四、五十人参加，经常参加的有作家韩雪野、金史良、田在耕、崔明翊，评论家安含光，诗人李灿，剧作家韩泰泉等多人。他们一致认为毛主席的讲话，解决了人民文艺建设的基本方向问题。当时，文学艺术总同盟即以金日成将军的指示以及苏联文艺方针和毛主席的文艺讲话为指导方针，号召全体文艺工作者深入群众，了解和反映劳动人民的生活思想和感情，为人民创作通俗化的作品。
    毛主席的讲话在朝鲜南半部同样产生了深刻和广泛的影响。一九四六年八月，汉城大学中国文学系曾将毛主席的讲话译成朝鲜文出版。据当时在汉城从事文艺工作的汉城大学中国文学系助教裴澔说：“八·一五”日本投降后，南朝鲜文艺界曾展开一个学习毛主席文艺方针的热潮，其后，随着美李匪帮对民主运动的残暴镇压，革命文艺工作者即转入地下，成立了文艺研究会。文艺研究会以毛主席的讲话作为教科书，组织讲习会。一直到现在，毛主席的文艺讲话仍在南朝鲜的广大游击地区流行。
    最近，朝鲜文艺界展开了一个新的学习运动。文学艺术总同盟动员了大批作家、诗人、剧作家、画家到部队，工厂，农村中去体验生活，改造思想，从事创作，并协助工农兵的文艺活动。在学习运动中，许多朝鲜文艺工作者在学习金日成将军对文艺工作者的讲话的同时，重新学习了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话。许多文艺工作者写信给文学艺术总同盟，要求重印毛主席的讲话的译本。文学艺术总同盟中央委员会已决定重印这一文件的译本。朝鲜文学艺术总同盟中央委员会副委员长李泰俊说：朝鲜文艺工作者在新的学习运动中，经过深入地学习金日成将军和毛主席关于文艺问题的讲话与实际的锻炼，必将创作出更多更好的作品。特别是毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话朝鲜文译本的重新出版，不论对作家对评论家，都会有莫大的指导作用。
    【新华社布拉格二十二日电】毛主席一九四二年五月在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，受到西欧和美洲各国进步文艺界的重视。许多进步的报刊和出版社都发表了毛主席的讲话，进步的作家们并认真地研究这篇讲话的伟大意义。
    在法国，“彼埃·西盖尔”出版公司在一九四九年十月，即中华人民共和国政府刚刚宣告成立的时候，出版了这篇讲话的法译本。编者在译本卷首介绍说：“这本书里的毛泽东的论文是在好久以前发表的，但是它对目前中国的革命、文化运动和新中国文学艺术的方向仍旧起着指导作用。毛泽东在论文中所作的明确指示，在中国最近各次艺术家与作家的会议上一直被遵循着和肯定着。”“彼埃·西盖尔”出版公司的这一单行本出版之后很快就销售一空。这一版本曾流传到意大利和拉丁美洲国家，西班牙文和葡萄牙文的译本大多是以法译本为依据的。
    意大利共产党的理论杂志“再生”和群众性周刊“新生活报”，都曾刊载过毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话。意共出版的“毛泽东选集”中，也刊载了这篇讲话的全文。后来意共出版局又把这篇讲话印成单行本，出版之后立即销售一空，单行本现在已经发行了三版。
    在英国，英国共产党出版的“现代季刊”第四卷第一期曾刊载了毛主席讲话的译文。英国的进步文艺团体在集会上曾反复讨论过这篇讲话，许多文艺批评家在他们的论文中曾一再引用毛主席对人民文艺路线的精辟见解。现在，英国进步出版界正在等待“毛泽东选集”的正式英文译本，他们将根据正式译本在英国重新出版毛主席的讲话。
    在瑞典，“文艺月刊”曾摘要刊载了毛主席的讲话。芬兰也曾发行过瑞典文的摘译本，这些译文极受瑞典和芬兰进步文艺界人士的重视。
    在美国，国际出版社在一九五○年曾出版了这篇讲话的单行本。在此以前，纽约“工人日报”也曾登载过讲话的摘译。纽约进步文艺工作者在单行本未出版以前，就已根据译文的手稿来研究和讨论过。毛主席提出的到群众中和到斗争中去，以及要求革命的文艺服从政治的原则，对于美国文艺工作者特别有意义。美国著名作家、和平战士法斯特表示，毛主席的讲话曾使他深受感动。他说：“这篇讲话给我开辟了新的道路，使我们看清了我们的时代使美国以及今日的中国产生这样的文艺问题的新因素。”进步的文艺杂志“群众与主流”编辑西伦说：“毛泽东的讲话对我们美国人来说是一个很好的武器。它帮助我们跟感染了那么多的美国作家的资产阶级腐朽思想进行斗争。在资本主义的美国，各方面都有资本主义的压力，其中主要压力之一就是使作家不去描写工人。我们的主要任务之一是使作家、艺术家跟工人阶级结合起来。毛泽东一针见血地说明了这个中心的问题。我们觉得他的话在我们日常争取和平和世界正义的斗争中是一种鼓舞。”最近曾在美国各地旅行的美国年青的黑人作家布朗说：“我这次旅行时，曾在许多地方，特别是在太平洋沿岸，和许多作家进行过讨论。在这些讨论中，我发现毛泽东的见解给人以很深的印象。那些青年作家和艺术家们常常引述毛泽东的话。他们都在设法寻求他们在工人阶级中的地位，由此可以想见，毛泽东在思想上对他们有多大的帮助了。”
    毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话也被介绍到拉丁美洲国家去。巴西共产党理论杂志“为了全体”和古巴进步杂志“基本”，都曾在一九五一年刊载过这篇讲话的译文。最近曾访问过新中国的巴西名诗人、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人亚玛多说：“中国文艺界遵循的毛泽东思想所照耀的道路，也就是巴西文艺界在争取和平、反对美国帝国主义的斗争中所走的道路。”和亚玛多一道访问我国的古巴名诗人纪廉也说：“毛泽东的讲话在为人民服务的人民文学的概念里，是一个具有非常大的价值的文件。”
