    The front line is now full of the colors of spring. The志愿军(Volunteer Army) fighters active on the blocking front are full of youthful vitality and are actively launching sniper competitions against the enemy in front of them. They lurk on the mountains from morning till night, searching for "prey" with hawk-like eyes, and accurately shooting single bullets into their bodies.

    In mid-April, the fighters guarding a certain position killed or wounded 139 enemies in the sniper competition. There were two sharpshooters on this position, one named Zhang Jiaxue and the other named Ma Cai. The two men shot down twelve enemies in ten days. One day, an enemy popped his head out of the traffic trench, and Zhang Jiaxue immediately aimed at the guy's chest and shot him dead. Zhang Jiaxue said to Ma Cai, "You wait and see, there will be more coming to take the bait." Sure enough, three American soldiers jumped out of the enemy's fortifications, dragging two tarpaulins to pull the dead bodies away. Zhang Jiaxue happily said to Ma Cai, "Come on, I'll aim at the first one, you aim at the second one." Just as the three American devils had pulled up the dead bodies and turned to leave, Zhang Jiaxue gently shouted "Fire!" Two shots rang out simultaneously, and two guys immediately fell into the traffic trench, while the remaining one fled in a rolling, crawling fashion. Another day at dusk, Zhang Jiaxue, who had been sniping all day, was preparing to return when he suddenly noticed a small tree shaking on the enemy's position, but there was not a bit of wind at that time. He was very surprised, so he lay down and observed carefully, only to find that the enemy was carrying a small tree and running along the shallow traffic trench. Zhang Jiaxue found it funny, thinking: "The devils have even come up with these camouflage tricks, but you can't escape from my hands." He immediately fired a shot, knocking the guy over on his back in the traffic trench, and the tree fell with him.

    In the sniper competition, a large number of sharpshooters have emerged. On the Imjin River front, there is a young sharpshooter named Luo Luzhong, who has already killed or wounded twenty-five enemies by himself. One rainy morning, Luo Luzhong found five enemies wriggling in the opposite bushes, and he shot them one by one. On another occasion, an enemy went down the mountain to change the guard. Because he was afraid of our sharpshooters, he crawled close to the ground. But just as he was about to raise his head to look around, with a "pop" sound, Luo Luzhong's bullet hit him in the head. On another position, the fighters killed or wounded eighty-four enemies in a week. In four shootings, Deputy Squad Leader Song killed or wounded twenty enemies with fifty-four bullets. Fighter Zhu Dekui killed three enemies with three bullets while on sentry duty. When another fighter came to relieve him, he said, "Wait for me to kill an enemy before I leave." Sure enough, an enemy poked his head out of the trench, and Zhu Dekui shot him down with one shot.

    Sometimes the enemy, angered by our snipers, blindly bombard and sweep with artillery and machine guns. As soon as they hear a gunshot, they fire hundreds or thousands of shells. But our snipers are even better concealed at this time; as soon as the shelling stops, gun barrels stretch out from everywhere, shooting the enemy with bullet after bullet.

    Sniping is not only the most enthusiastic "homework" for infantrymen, but even artillerymen are actively participating in this battle. The artillerymen said: "This way of fighting can not only eliminate the enemy, but also improve technology. This 'business' is very worthwhile!" Many master artillerymen actively look for opportunities and use sudden bombardments to strike enemies who are gathering or moving in groups. On the central front, many people know the story of mortar master Chen Biao. He has already killed or wounded two hundred and eighty enemies with mortar shells. Once, more than a hundred enemy troops were noisily having fun in a grove of trees. Chen Biao set up his mortar steadily and aimed accurately, firing seven shells in a row, killing or wounding more than fifty enemies. On another position, Li Zhiyou, a 60-gunner of the Sixth Company of a certain Volunteer Army unit, was also a skilled gunner. He once found six enemies looking around at the terrain on the opposite mountain. He said, "Good opportunity, let you taste the flavor of our 60-gun!" He set up his 60-gun and killed two enemies with one shell. Li Zhiyou predicted that the enemy would come to pull the dead bodies, so he measured the distance, set the target, and polished the shells brightly, waiting. Sure enough, a group of enemies came. Just as they dragged up the dead bodies, Li Zhiyou shouted, "Don't rush, wait to drag a few more away!" He fired several shells in a row, killing or wounding five more enemies.

    On the spring blocking front, the fighters' interest in sniping the enemy is getting higher and higher. The fighters composed a 快板(clapper talk) and sang: "Peach blossoms are blooming, birds are singing, sniping is really active, you one shot, me one shell, little by little, the enemy can't stand it. The invading soldiers are scared, dare not show their heads, only bombard, my position is made of steel, never afraid of your artillery. Kill hundreds of you every day, and finally eat you all." On the front lines, the fighters are filled with this joy of sniping the enemy.

    狙击兵的喜悦
    新华社记者  刘尔宁  路云  战旗
    前线已是一片春色。活跃在阻击战线上的志愿军战士们充满着青年人的活力，积极地向当面敌人展开了狙击竞赛。他们从早到晚隐伏在山岭上，用鹰样的眼睛搜索着“猎物”，准确地把单发的枪弹射在他们的身上。
    四月中旬，守卫在某处阵地上的战士们就在狙击竞赛中杀伤了一百三十九个敌人。这个阵地上有两个神枪手，一个叫张家学，另一个叫马才。两个人在十天中就打倒了十二个敌人。有一天，一个敌人从交通沟里冒出身子来，张家学立刻瞄准这个家伙的胸膛，一枪就把他打死了。张家学对马才说：“你等着瞧吧，一会儿又有来上钩的。”果然，又从敌人工事里窜出三个美国兵，他们拖着两块雨布上来拉死尸。张家学满心欢喜地向马才说：“来，我瞄第一个，你瞄第二个。”三个美国鬼子刚拉上死尸回头走，张家学轻轻喊一声“    打！”两枪齐放，两个家伙马上栽倒在交通沟里，剩下的一个连滚带爬地逃走了。另一天黄昏，张家学打了一天狙击正准备回来的时候，忽然发现敌人阵地上有一颗小树在摇幌，可是那时却没有一点风。他很奇怪，就伏下来仔细观察，原来是敌人扛着一颗小树在顺着浅浅的交通沟跑动。张家学觉得好笑，心想：“鬼子竟然搞起这些障眼法来了，可是你逃不出老子的手的。”他立刻打过去一枪，把那家伙打得仰面翻倒在交通沟里，那颗树也随着倒了下去。
    在狙击竞赛中，涌现出大批神枪手。在临津江前线，有一个年青的神枪手名叫罗鲁忠，他一个人已经打死打伤了二十五个敌人。在一个风雨交加的早晨，罗鲁忠发现对面草丛中有五个敌人在蠕动，他就把他们一个一个地打死了。另一次，一个敌人下山去换哨，因为怕我们的神枪手，他紧贴着地面爬进。但当他刚想抬起头来张望的时候，“叭”的一声，罗鲁忠的子弹就打在他的脑袋上了。在另一处阵地上，战士们在一周中就打死打伤了八十四个敌人。宋副班长在四次射击中，用五十四发子弹杀伤了二十个敌人。战士朱德奎在了望哨位上，用三发子弹打倒了三个敌人。另一个战士来换哨时，他说：“等我打死一个敌人再换。”果然，有一个敌人从战壕里冒出头来，朱德奎一枪就把他打倒了。
    有时敌人被我们的狙击兵打得恼羞成怒，就用大炮机关枪盲目地乱轰乱扫，那怕是听到一声枪响，就将成百成千发炮弹轰出来。但我们的狙击手们却在这时隐蔽得更好；炮声一停，条条枪筒就又从各处伸出来，用一颗颗的子弹射击着敌人。
    狙击，已经不仅是步兵们最热心的“功课”，连炮兵们也积极地参加这种战斗。炮手们说：“这样打法，既能消灭敌人，又能提高技术，这个‘买卖’很算得来啊！”许多神炮手积极地寻找战机，用突然的轰击来打击集结或成群地活动着的敌人。在中部前线，许多人都知道迫击炮神炮手陈彪的故事。他已经用迫击炮弹杀伤了二百八十个敌人。有一次，一百多名敌军正在一处树丛里闹嚷嚷地寻乐。陈彪把迫击炮架得稳稳的、瞄得准准的，接连放出七发炮弹就炸死炸伤了五十多个敌人。在另一处阵地上，志愿军某部第六连的六○炮手李志有也是一个打炮的能手。他有一次发现六个敌人在对面山上东张西望地看地形。他说：“好机会，让你尝尝咱六○炮的滋味吧！”他架起六○炮，用一发炮弹就打死了两个敌人。李志有预料敌人会来拉死尸，于是又测好距离，定好目标，把炮弹擦得亮亮的，等待着。一会儿果然来了一伙敌人，他们刚拖起死尸，李志有喊了一声：“先别忙，等着多拖几个去吧！”他一连打出几发炮弹，又杀伤了五个敌人。
    在春季的阻击战线上，战士们狙击敌人的兴趣越来越高。战士们编了一首快板唱道：“桃花开，小鸟叫，打狙击，真活跃，你一枪，我一炮，积少成多，敌人吃不消。侵略兵吓坏了，不敢露露头，光打炮，老子阵地钢铁造，永远不怕你大炮。每天打死你几百个，最后要把你全吃掉。”在前线阵地上，战士们都洋溢着这种狙击敌人的喜悦。
