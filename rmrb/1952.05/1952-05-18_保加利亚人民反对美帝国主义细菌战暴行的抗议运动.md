    Bulgarian People's Protest Movement Against the American Imperialist Germ Warfare Atrocities
    Bulgarian Renowned Social Activist  Buladalov
    After learning about the new atrocities of germ warfare committed by the American imperialists, the working people of enterprises, government agencies and agricultural cooperatives, scientific and cultural workers, women and youth across Bulgaria have held mass rallies to express their angry protests.
    In Bulgaria, there is not a single corner where the working people are not voicing their protests against the unprecedentedly brutal crimes of the American imperialists. The Bulgarian Democratic Women's Committee stated in its telegram to the United Nations: "Overcoming epidemics was originally a scientific victory. Spreading epidemics for military purposes is an outrageous crime against humanity. We demand that the bestial acts of the American imperialists be stopped and the criminals be brought to international justice." The women of the eighth district of Pleven declared in a telegram to the National Committee for the Defense of Peace: "We learned with extreme indignation of the beastly atrocities of the American and British robbers in Korea. We firmly agree with the demands of world public opinion: immediately stop the war in Korea and severely punish the war criminals and the executioners who slaughter the Korean people."
    The members of the Dimitrov People's Youth League in the school attached to the "Bulgaria" factory stated: "The fighting Korean people know that all progressive humanity stands by their side. The use of bacteriological weapons by the American and British robbers once again proves their desperate struggle and weakness. They will not escape the judgment of the people." The farmers of the village of Bistrets also passed a telegram to the United Nations at a mass protest rally.
    On March 11th this year, at a protest meeting of the Bulgarian Union of Scientific Workers, many well-known academicians, professors and lecturers from higher specialized schools, and scientific workers from various scientific research institutes shouted "Oppose the bestial acts of the American and British interventionists in Korea" and expressed their unity with the heroic Korean people in their struggle for freedom, independence, and peace. Bulgarian medical workers have stood at the forefront of the opposition to the germ warfare of the modern barbarians of Wall Street.
    Academician Vonakimir Markov said: "This shocking plan of the invaders to use scientific achievements to destroy humanity first exposed the moral hypocrisy of the American and British imperialists and proved the isolation and helplessness of the increasingly decadent imperialist camp." Academician Metoki Popov wrote: "We, the Bulgarian scientific workers, appeal loudly to the conscience and honor of scientists all over the world, urging them to oppose the use of science to massively destroy people and overturn the achievements of centuries of human culture."
    The Bulgarian people contribute to the cause of world peace with their peaceful labor in building the foundations of socialism in their own country, with their generous support to the suffering Korean people, and with their unwavering determination to defend national independence with all their strength.
    The Bulgarian people firmly believe that the struggle of peace-loving people will surely triumph. As the men and women workers of the Anna Ventna factory expressed it: "Humanity will not forget the deep sins of the American aggressors. The murderers who killed Korean women and children will be severely judged by the people of all countries. The people have enough strength to punish these mad and shameless criminals."

    保加利亚人民反对美帝国主义细菌战暴行的抗议运动
    保加利亚著名社会活动家  勃拉达洛夫
    保加利亚人民获悉美帝国主义者进行细菌战的新的暴行以后，全国各企业、机关和农业合作社的劳动者，科学、文化工作者，妇女和青年，都纷纷举行群众集会，提出愤怒的抗议。
    在保加利亚，现在没有一个角落的劳动人民不喊出抗议美帝国主义空前残暴罪行的呼声。保加利亚民主妇女委员会致联合国的抗议电文里说：“战胜瘟疫原是科学上的一个胜利。为了军事目的而传布瘟疫，是反人类的滔天罪行。我们要求制止美帝国主义者的兽行，并将罪犯交由国际法庭审判。”普列芬城第八区的妇女们给保卫和平全国委员会的电文宣称：“我们以极愤恨的心情获悉美英强盗们在朝鲜的野兽般的暴行，我们坚决同意全世界舆论的要求：立即制止在朝鲜的战争并严惩战犯和屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手。”
    “保加利亚”工厂附设学校里的季米特洛夫人民青年团团员们称：“正在斗争着的朝鲜人民知道，所有进步人类都站在他们这一边。美英强盗使用细菌武器又一次地证明了它的绝望的挣扎和软弱无力。他们将逃不脱人民的审判。”比斯特勒茨村的农民们，也在群众抗议大会上通过了致联合国电。
    今年三月十一日，在保加利亚科学工作者联盟的抗议会上，许多著名的院士、高等专门学校里的教授和讲师，与各种科学研究院的科学工作者们，高呼“反对美英干涉者在朝鲜的兽行”，并表示要与英勇的朝鲜人民在其争取自由、独立与和平的斗争中团结一致。保加利亚的医学工作者们，站到了反对华尔街现代野蛮人的细菌战的最前线。
    伏那基米尔·马尔可夫院士说：“侵略者这种利用科学成就来毁灭人类的骇人听闻的计划，首先揭穿了美英帝国主义者道德的假面具，并证明了日益腐朽的帝国主义阵营孤立无援。”麦托基·波波夫院士写道：“我们保加利亚的科学工作者向着全世界科学家的良心和荣誉大声疾呼，使他们反对利用科学去大量毁灭人们和覆灭整世纪的人类文化的成果。”
    保加利亚人民以在自己祖国建设社会主义基础的和平劳动，以对受难的朝鲜人民的慷慨支援、以用一切力量来保卫民族独立的坚定不移的决心来为争取世界和平的事业作出贡献。
    保加利亚人民坚信爱好和平人民的斗争必将胜利。正如安娜·文特娜工厂的男女工人们所表示的：“人类不会忘掉美国侵略者的深重罪恶。杀害朝鲜妇女儿童的杀人犯将受到各国人民的严厉裁判。人民是有足够力量来制裁这些疯狂无耻的罪犯的。”
