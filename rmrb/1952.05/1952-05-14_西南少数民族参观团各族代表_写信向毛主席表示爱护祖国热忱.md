Respected Chairman Mao: We have traveled over mountains and rivers to arrive in the capital, and now we are about to leave you. The twenty-plus days we spent here may not be long, but our boundless reverence, gratitude, and longing for you are beyond words.

Chairman Mao, our great benefactor! In the past, during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, we had eyes but could not see the beautiful things of our motherland; we had ears but could not hear the vibrant sounds of our motherland. Moreover, under the instigation and enslavement of imperialism, we lived through days of bitterness and mistakenly believed that the world was like what we experienced. This time, you gave us the opportunity to visit, and it was as if we had new eyes and ears, seeing and hearing everything about the motherland with our own senses. Who can say that our country is poor and backward? Who would be willing to listen to the deceit of imperialist elements again?

Our motherland is great and lovable! Please allow us to report to you some of our personal experiences.

From the Southwest to North China, we traveled thousands of miles. What appeared in our eyes were infinitely beautiful mountains and rivers, and boundless plains, all filled with freedom and happiness. In Beijing, no matter where we went, we were met with sincere and moving welcomes. Even the children would reach out their little hands to greet us. Everyone held our hands tightly, and we were often moved to tears. Under your education, our ethnic groups are united and loving, even closer than a family. We deeply realize that it is not the Han people who discriminate against us, but the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

Chairman Mao! From you on down, no one we have encountered has looked down on us as being dirty. In the past, we would be trembling with fear standing before a "village head" or a "Han official"; now, we can talk freely and without worry to leaders at all levels of the Central Government.

The people's leader is so considerate of the people! This time we came to visit, when it was cold, we were given cotton clothes; when it was hot, we were given single-layer clothes, and worried that we didn't have clothes to change, we were also given serge suits. To prevent us from getting sick, they checked our bodies and gave us vaccinations, and at all times respected our lifestyle habits. This is even more caring than our own parents! When we think of how these enjoyments and treatments are earned by the blood of countless martyrs and the sweat of countless working people, we feel ashamed and deeply saddened.

We deeply thank you and the leaders at all levels of the Central Government for your earnest instructions. Each conversation made our hearts clearer and helped us see the path of development for minority nationalities.

We visited many factories and were very excited to see machine production. Comparing the oppression suffered by workers during the Japanese imperialist occupation and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries with the situation today, where they are masters of their own affairs and carry out production with a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, we have received a great deal of education. We sincerely admire the technical assistance provided by our Soviet elder brothers. We were most impressed with the Qinghe Woolen Mill and the Agricultural Machinery Factory. Many representatives were deceived by imperialism in the past and always thought that wool was a "foreign product"; now they see that it is possible to use domestically made machines to spin domestically produced wool into very beautiful woolen cloth, and their thinking has undergone a great change. This fact has also encouraged our determination to improve animal husbandry. The advanced agricultural technology and production experience in the Han areas have also given us concrete guidance on the direction and prospects for developing production.

We visited the Palace Museum, the Temple of Heaven, and Longevity Hill. We admire the great achievements created by our ancestors, the working people, and we are proud of the long history and culture of our motherland. After visiting Tsinghua University, we gained a lot of scientific knowledge. We saw students from Eastern European people's democratic countries studying here, and everyone was greatly encouraged. We entered the Central Institute for Nationalities with a happy mood. Chairman Mao! You know us deeply, and you will certainly be able to appreciate our pleasant state of mind.

Paper is short, but our experiences are endless!

Chairman Mao! As we deeply experience the greatness of our motherland, we feel an unparalleled sweetness, like a child sleeping in its mother's arms! And every day we see news reports of the crimes of the American imperialists spreading germs, we are so angry! We have publicly protested against this heartless and insane crime. If these beasts are not given a heavy blow, they will not know repentance. Please tell the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers that our ethnic minorities in the Southwest are united with the people of the whole country and are resolutely opposed to American imperialism. In order to defend the prosperity of the motherland and the development of all nationalities, we resolutely guarantee to you and the volunteers: we will better strengthen national unity, expose the crimes of American imperialism in spreading germs to all ethnic groups, we will organize to fight against American imperialism's germ warfare. We will also tell the people of all ethnic groups about what we have learned and seen during our visit, call on them to respond to your slogans, increase production, and strengthen the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea. In order to express our determination to consolidate the borders of the motherland, the young people among the representatives have successively requested to join the Communist Youth League, to contribute all their strength to the revolutionary cause, and to play a model and leading role in various work positions in the construction of the border areas. Now we are all actively making plans for action after returning home. A Dai representative, Yan Kong, put it well: "If the imperialist elements stick their heads into the motherland, we will cut off their heads; if they stick their feet in, we will cut off their feet." We have full confidence and determination to love our motherland and support the Volunteers.
We wish you good health.

One hundred and seventy-eight representatives of thirty-six ethnic groups from the Southwest Minority Nationalities Visiting Group

    西南少数民族参观团各族代表
    写信向毛主席表示爱护祖国热忱
    敬爱的毛主席：我们经过了万水千山来到了首都，现在我们又要离开您了。在这里的二十多个昼夜不算长，我们对您的无比的崇敬、感谢和留恋的情意却是无法说得尽的。
    毛主席，我们伟大的恩人！从前，在蒋匪帮统治的时代，我们白白生了眼睛，看不到祖国美好的东西；白白有双耳朵，听不到祖国热闹的声音。而且在帝国主义的挑拨和奴役下，我们过饱了悲苦的日子，误以为人世之间，都是像我们所遭遇的一样。这次您给我们参观的机会，我们就像新生了眼睛和耳朵一样，对祖国的一切是亲眼见到和亲耳听到了。谁能再说我们的国家是贫穷落后的呢？谁愿再听信帝国主义分子的欺骗呢？
    我们的祖国是伟大的可爱的啊！请允许我们向您报告几句我们亲身的体会。
    从西南到华北，我们走了几千里路。在我们眼里所出现的是无限美好的山河，是广阔无边的平原，到处都充满了自由和幸福。在北京，我们不论走到那个地方，所遇到的都是诚挚的欢迎，动人的欢迎，连小孩子也会伸出小手来招呼。大家紧紧地握着我们的手不放，我们有许多次都感动得流出了眼泪。在您的教育下，我们各族人民团结友爱，比一家人还亲。我们深深体会到歧视我们的不是汉族人民，而是帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮。
    毛主席！从您起，所有和我们接触的人，没有再嫌我们脏的了。从前站在一个“保长”或“汉官”面前，我们会胆战心惊；现在，我们和中央各级首长畅所欲言地谈话，毫无顾虑。
    人民的领袖对人民是这样的体贴入微啊！我们这次来参观，天冷了，给我们棉衣；天热了，给我们单衣，还耽心我们没有换洗的，又送给我们哔叽衣服。为了避免我们生病，替我们检查身体，打预防针，而且在任何时候都尊重我们的生活习惯。这比我们的父母还关心我们！当我们想到这些享受和待遇是多少先烈的热血和多少劳动人民的汗水所换来的时候，我们感到惭愧，心里十分难过。
    我们深深地感谢您和中央各级首长对我们恳切的指示。每一次谈话，都使我们的心开朗了一些，使我们看清了少数民族发展的道路。
    我们参观了不少的工厂，看到机器生产感到很兴奋。从工人们在日本帝国主义占领的时期与国民党反动派统治时期的受压迫情形，和今天当家作主发挥着高度爱国热情进行生产的情形的比较中，我们更受到了不少的教育。苏联老大哥们在技术上对我们的帮助，使我们衷心敬佩。我们对清河制呢厂和农业机械厂印象最深。不少的代表以前受了帝国主义的欺骗，从来就认为毛呢是“外国货”；现在看到能用本国造的机器，纺织本国出的羊毛，制成很漂亮的呢子，思想有了很大的改变。这一事实也鼓舞了我们改良畜牧的决心。汉族地区先进的农业技术和生产经验也给我们具体地指出了发展生产的方向和远景。
    我们参观了故宫博物院、天坛和万寿山，我们对先辈劳动人民创造出来的伟大成绩感到敬佩，我们对祖国悠久的历史文化感到骄傲。我们参观了清华大学之后，获得了不少的科学知识。我们看见了在这里学习的东欧人民民主国家的学生，彼此都受到了很大的鼓励。我们曾带着一种幸福的心情走进中央民族学院。毛主席！您是深知我们的人，您一定能体会我们那种愉快的心境。
    纸短话长，我们的体会说不完啊！
    毛主席！当我们深刻地体验着祖国的伟大的时候，我们像孩子睡在母亲怀里一样领受着无比的甜蜜！而每天我们看到了报上登载着美帝国主义撒布细菌罪行的消息，我们是多么愤恨啊！我们对这种毫无心肝、丧心病狂的罪恶，曾经公开作了抗议。对这批野兽们，如果不给以重重的打击，它们是不会知道悔悟的。请您转告朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军，我们西南各少数民族与全国人民一致团结，和美帝国主义誓不两立。为了保卫祖国繁荣和各民族的发展，我们坚决向您和志愿军保证：我们要更好地加强民族团结，把美帝国主义撒布细菌的罪恶向各族人民揭露，我们要组织起来和美帝国主义细菌战作斗争。我们还要把参观的心得和见闻，告诉各族人民，号召他们响应您的口号，提高生产，加强抗美援朝的力量。为了表示巩固祖国边疆的决心，代表中的年青人已纷纷要求加入青年团，把全部力量贡献给革命事业，要在建设边疆的各种工作岗位上起模范和带头作用。现在我们大家都纷纷作了回家后的行动计划。一位傣族代表岩空说得好：“帝国主义分子如果把头伸进祖国来，就斩他的头，伸进脚来，就砍断他的脚。”我们是完全有这样信心和决心来爱护我们的祖国，来支援志愿军的。祝您身体健康
