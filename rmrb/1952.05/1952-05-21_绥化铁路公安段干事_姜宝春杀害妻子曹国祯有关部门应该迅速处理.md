    Suihua Railway Public Security Section Cadre
    Jiang Baochun Murdered His Wife Cao Guozhen. Relevant Departments Should Handle This Swiftly.
    Editor: I want to speak out for the victimized woman Cao Guozhen, who narrowly escaped death.
    Jiang Baochun, a cadre in the Secretariat Section of the Northeast Suihua Railway Public Security Section, was corrupt and degenerate, and had long wanted to abandon his wife, Cao Guozhen. His father, Jiang Xijiao, is seventy years old, a bad egg who once attempted to rape Cao Guozhen. Failing in his attempt, he held a grudge and often instigated Jiang Baochun to abuse Cao Guozhen. Jiang Xijiao told Jiang Baochun, "If you don't kill Cao Guozhen, sooner or later she will harm you." This fueled Jiang Baochun's wicked intention to murder his wife. On March 2nd, Jiang Baochun, under the guise of "visiting relatives," took Cao Guozhen, their child, and Jiang Xijiao from Suihua to Qiqihar by train. When the train arrived near Suiling Station, Jiang Baochun coaxed Cao Guozhen to the train door and violently pushed her off the train. Cao Guozhen grabbed the handrail of the train ladder, pleading, "What's wrong with you? If you don't like me, a divorce is fine, why harm me?" The vicious Jiang Baochun then punched and kicked her, finally pushing Cao Guozhen off the train. Cao Guozhen was severely injured and lost consciousness. She lay in the snowy wilderness all night. When she woke up the next day, she barely managed to crawl to a village and was subsequently sent to Suihua Railway Hospital for treatment.
    The criminal Jiang Baochun, as a public security cadre and a Communist Party member, acted with such disregard for the law, arbitrarily harming women, which is truly intolerable. In order to implement the Marriage Law and ensure the safety of women's lives, I demand that the People's Government arrest and bring Jiang Baochun to justice, and that Jiang Xijiao also be punished.

    Editor's Note: According to our information, the victim Cao Guozhen has now died from her injuries. This case is extremely serious, and relevant departments should handle it swiftly and seriously, and publish the results in the newspaper.

    绥化铁路公安段干事
    姜宝春杀害妻子曹国祯有关部门应该迅速处理
    编辑同志：我要替死里逃生的被害妇女曹国祯伸冤。
    东北绥化铁路公安段秘书科干事姜宝春，腐化堕落，早想抛弃妻子曹国祯。他的父亲姜锡焦，年七十岁，是一个坏蛋，曾经企图强奸曹国祯，因未得逞，怀恨在心，经常唆使姜宝春虐待曹国祯。姜锡焦对姜宝春说：“你要不弄死曹国祯，早晚她也会把你害死。”这就助长了姜宝春杀害妻子的罪恶凶心。三月二日，姜宝春以“串亲”为名，和姜锡焦带着曹国祯、小孩等从绥化乘火车往齐齐哈尔。当火车开到绥棱车站附近时，姜宝春把曹国祯哄到车门口，就猛力往车下推她。曹国祯用手拉住车梯把手，哀求说：“你怎么啦，看我不好，离婚好啦，何必害我？”狠毒的姜宝春又拳打脚踢，终于把曹国祯推下车去。曹国祯受了重伤，当时昏了过去。在冰天雪地的郊野，她躺了一夜，第二天醒来，才勉强爬到一个村子里，随后被送到绥化铁路医院治疗。
    凶犯姜宝春身为公安干部，又是共产党员，竟如此目无法纪，任意残害妇女，令人实在不能容忍。为了贯彻执行婚姻法，确保妇女生命安全，我要求人民政府把姜宝春逮捕法办，对姜锡焦也应予以惩处。
  　绥化铁路一工人家属　杨绪琴
    编者按：据我们了解，受害人曹国祯现已不治身死。这一案件是极为严重的，有关部门应迅速地、严肃地进行处理，并将处理结果，在报上公布。
