    People's Bank of China Headquarters Initially Adjusts Organization, Streamlines Staffing
    Draws Out Over 700 People to Work in Local People's Banks
    On the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, and after ideological construction and initial reasonable adjustment of organization and streamlined staffing, the People's Bank of China headquarters has overcome bureaucracy, and a new atmosphere has emerged in its work.
    In the past, the work of the People's Bank of China headquarters had a serious bureaucratic style. According to statistics, in the ten months from January to October of 1951 alone, there were more than 84,000 incoming and outgoing official documents and telegrams, with an average monthly receipt and dispatch of 8,450 documents and telegrams. The postage and telecommunications expenses for these ten months exceeded 1 billion yuan. In fact, of these incoming and outgoing documents, only a small portion were truly necessary, and more than 80 percent could have been avoided altogether, or could have been handled without telegrams. There were also too many layers in the internal processing of official documents. For example, for the accounting department to process an ordinary document, it had to go through two registrations and two signings from the department to the section to the person in charge; when the person in charge drafted the document, it also had to go through two registrations and one signing from the section to the department. This complicated procedure was both time-consuming, disruptive, and wasteful of manpower. Currently, the People's Bank of China headquarters has initially adjusted its organization and streamlined its staffing, with the number of members reduced from 2,018 to 1,141. The number of people reduced accounts for more than 43 percent of the total. Redundancy in work and waste of manpower have also been greatly reduced. For example, the number of receiving and dispatching staff in the accounting department has now been reduced from ten to four. In the handling of official documents, four layers of procedures have been simplified; the round-trip time for processing each official document has also been shortened by one hour compared to before. In the past, the four business departments of currency management, rural finance, business management, and foreign business had to have the governor approve all kinds of large and small matters, which trapped the leadership work in the quagmire of clericalism, and the ability of the staff could not be fully utilized. After adjustment and streamlining, these departments clearly stipulated the work responsibilities of each level, and many routine tasks could be handed over to lower-level agencies. This allows leading cadres to devote more time to studying and inspecting work, and strengthens the leadership work.
    Due to the widespread criticism of the bourgeois ideology existing among the staff, the political atmosphere in the agency is more intense than before, and the enthusiasm for work has also been raised a step further. For example, the reconciliation work of the International Clearing Section had accumulated a lot in the previous months, but recently they completed all of it in a few days of concentrated effort, which was impossible in the past. Similar situations exist in other departments as well.
    After adjusting its organization and streamlining its staffing, the People's Bank of China headquarters decided to transfer more than 700 people to support lower-level banks; more than 98 percent of the cadres actively responded to the call to "support lower-level banks." Currently, the staff assigned to local lower-level banks have successively set off for their new posts.

    人民银行总行初步调整机构精简编制
    抽出七百多人分配到各地人民银行工作
    中国人民银行总行在“三反”胜利的基础上，经过思想建设，并初步合理地调整机构和精简编制以后，克服了文牍主义，工作中呈现了新的气象。
    人民银行总行机关工作过去有严重的文牍主义作风。据统计：仅一九五一年一月到十月的十个月当中，来往的公文电报就有八万四千多件，每月平均收发文电八千四百五十件。这十个月的邮电费开支在十亿元以上。实际上，这些来往的文电，除一少部分确实是必要的，其余有百分之八十以上都是可以不必行文或不必以电讯来往的。机关内部办理公文时层次也太多，例如会计处办理一件普通公文，由处到科到承办人，要经过两次登记、两次签收；承办人拟稿，由科到处也须两次登记、一次签收。这种繁复的手续，既误时、误事，又浪费人力。目前，人民银行总行初步调整了机构，精简了编制，成员已由二千零十八人减为一千一百四十一人。所减人员达总数的百分之四十三强。工作上的重复、人力的浪费也大大减少。例如会计处的收发工作人员，现在已由十人减为四人。在处理公文上，简化了四层手续；经办每一公文的往返时间也较前缩短了一小时。货币管理、农村金融、业务管理、国外业务等四个业务机构，过去处理各种大小问题都要经过行长批准，因而领导工作陷于事务主义的泥坑，工作人员的能力也不能充分发挥。调整和精简以后，这些部门明确规定了各级的工作责任，很多事务性的工作可以交下级机关处理。这样就能使领导干部抽出更多时间研究和检查工作，加强了领导工作的力量。
    由于普遍地批判了在工作人员当中存在着的资产阶级思想，机关里的政治空气较前浓厚，工作积极性也提高了一步。例如国际清算科的对账工作，在前几个月积压了很多，最近他们在几天时间内就全部突击对完，这是在过去所做不到的。类似情况在其他部门也有。
    人民银行总行在调整机构、紧缩编制以后，决定抽调七百多人支援下级行；百分之九十八以上的干部都积极响应了“支援下级行”的号召。目前被分配各地下级行的工作人员已陆续出发到新的工作岗位上去。
