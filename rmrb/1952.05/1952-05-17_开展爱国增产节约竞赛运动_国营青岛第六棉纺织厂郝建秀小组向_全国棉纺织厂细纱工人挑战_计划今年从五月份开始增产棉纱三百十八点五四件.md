    Launch Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Campaign
    Hao Jianxiu Group of State-Owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory
    Challenges Fine Yarn Workers in Cotton Textile Factories Nationwide
    Planning to Increase Cotton Yarn Production by 318.54 Pieces Starting from May This Year
    The Hao Jianxiu Group of the State-Owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory has initiated a friendly competition with fine yarn workers nationwide. Their letter of challenge is as follows:
    Dear Comrades of Fine Yarn Workers Nationwide:
    The "Three-Anti" Movement has cleared the obstacles on our path to increasing production and practicing thrift, greatly boosting our production enthusiasm. In order to consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement, to launch a patriotic production increase and thrift campaign, to strengthen our country's national defense and economic power, to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and to greet the high tide of national economic construction, our group plans to increase cotton yarn production by 318.54 pieces within this year (starting from May) and reduce waste cotton and defective yarn equivalent to 2,841 jin of millet in value. We are willing to propose a friendly patriotic production increase and thrift competition challenge to fine yarn worker comrades nationwide with this goal and the following conditions.
    1. Actively learn the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," ensure that the output of 23-count yarn per spindle for ten hours reaches 0.52 pounds (12.26 Hanks); the percentage of roller laps does not exceed 0.33%; the number of empty spindles does not exceed one ten-thousandth; and the doffing time per machine does not exceed 26 seconds (400 spindles on 26 machines, 10 doffers). The results of implementing the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" should average 96 points according to the Qingdao City "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" unified measurement scoring standards, increasing cotton yarn production for the country by 39.8175 pieces per month (compared to the fourth quarter of 1951).
    Note: If the production task is changed to 18-count yarn, then the output of 18-count yarn per spindle for ten hours should reach 0.714 pounds (13.05 Hanks), increasing cotton yarn production by 30 pieces per month; the rest is the same as for 23-count yarn.
    2. Strengthen mutual assistance and unity and sanitation work, resolutely struggle against yarn waste, caught threads, and feathery yarn, ensuring that defective yarn averages no more than four ten-thousandths and that total waste cotton does not exceed 13 liang per day.
    3. Do a good job in handover work and safety and health work, eliminate personal and machine accidents, and ensure an attendance rate of 96% or higher.
    4. Strengthen cultural learning, ensuring that the entire group participates in the rapid literacy method of learning, and strive to eliminate illiteracy in the entire group by the end of the third quarter.
    5. Hold a review meeting once a week, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and review the implementation of the competition plan.

    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂郝建秀小组
    向全国棉纺织厂细纱工人挑战
    计划今年从五月份开始增产棉纱三百十八点五四件
    国营青岛第六棉纺织厂郝建秀小组向全国细纱工人发起友谊竞赛。她们的挑战书如下：亲爱的全国细纱工人同志们：
    “三反”运动扫清了我们增产节约道路上的障碍，大大鼓舞了我们的生产热情。为了巩固“三反”运动的胜利成果，为了开展爱国增产节约运动，以增强我们祖国的国防力量和经济力量，支援中国人民志愿军，迎接全国经济建设的高潮，我们小组计划在年内（从五月份开始）增产棉纱三百一十八点五四件，减少回丝和坏纱相当于二千八百四十一斤小米的价值。我们愿以这目标和以下条件向全国细纱工人同志们提出友谊的爱国增产节约竞赛挑战。
    一、积极学习“郝建秀工作法”，保证二十三支纱每锭十小时产量达到○点五二磅（十二点二六亨司）；皮辊花率不超过百分之○点三三；空锭子不超过万分之一；每台车落纱时间不超过二十六秒（四百锭二十六台，落纱工十人）。执行“郝建秀工作法”的成绩，按青岛市“郝建秀工作法”统一测定评分标准平均达到九十六分，每月为国家多增产棉纱三十九点八一七五件（同一九五一年第四季比）。
    注：如果生产任务改变为十八支纱时，则十八支纱每锭十小时产量达到○点七一四磅（十三点○五亨司），每月多增产棉纱三十件；其余同二十三支纱。
    二、加强互助团结和清洁工作，坚决和节纱、夹线、羽毛纱作斗争，保证坏纱平均不超过万分之四，回丝总量每日不超过十三啢。
    三、做好交接班工作和安全卫生工作，消灭人身和机器的事故，保证出勤率达到百分之九十六以上。
    四、加强文化学习，保证全组参加速成识字法学习，争取在第三季终全组消灭文盲。
    五、每周开一次检查会议，开展批评和自我批评，检查竞赛计划的执行情况。
