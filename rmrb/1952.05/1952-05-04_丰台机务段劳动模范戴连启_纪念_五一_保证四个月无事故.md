    Model Worker Dai Lianqi of Fengtai Locomotive Depot
    Commemorates "May Day" by Guaranteeing Four Months Without Accidents
    To the Editor: Dai Lianqi, a model worker of the lathe team at Fengtai Locomotive Depot, is commemorating the "May Day" Labor Day with the action of guaranteeing four months without accidents. During the "Three-Anti" movement, although his team had two fewer members, under his leadership, there were no faulty or scrapped parts, nor was there any extension of the locomotives' stay in the depot. The busier he gets, the more carefully he studies the technology. Since the team implemented high-speed cutting, he has found ways to speed up the lathe and increase work efficiency twofold. His action has driven many lathe teams to implement high-speed or semi-high-speed cutting one hundred percent. In the first quarter, he received the title of model worker. In February and March, the entire team also won the red flag of excellence among the six lathe teams. Under his hard work, as of April 23, his team has gone one hundred and fourteen days without an accident. To commemorate "May Day," he guaranteed to create a record of four months without accidents by the end of April. After "May Day," he will finish the rotating tube machine that was half completed last year, and modify the existing manual iron cutting machine to be operated by electricity.

    丰台机务段劳动模范戴连启
    纪念“五一”保证四个月无事故
    编辑同志：丰台机务段镟床组劳动模范戴连启，以保证四个月无事故的行动纪念“五一”劳动节。在“三反”运动中，他的小组虽然少了两个人，但在他带动下没有出过反手活和废活，也没有延长过机车在库内的停留时间。他越忙就越仔细研究技术。自从组里推行了高速切削法，他就想法加快了床子的转数，提高工作效率两倍。他的这一行动带动不少的镟床组，作到百分之百地实行高速切削或半高速切削。在第一季度中，他得到了模范工作者的称号。全组在二、三月份也得到了六个镟床组中的优胜红旗。在他的努力带动下，到四月二十三日止，他们小组已有一百一十四天没有出过事故。为了纪念“五一”，他保证在四月底创造四个月无事故的纪录。“五一”节以后，他要把去年已完成一半的转管机做好，把旧有的以人力操纵的切铁机改装，用电力来操纵。
