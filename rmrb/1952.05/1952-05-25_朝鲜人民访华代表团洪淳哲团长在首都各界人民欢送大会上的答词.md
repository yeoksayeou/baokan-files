Dear brothers and sisters, comrades, and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese capital, Beijing, and of China!

Our Korean People's Delegation to China came to visit our dear neighbor—the great People's Republic of China. Now, having completed our mission, we are about to bid farewell to this place that we are reluctant to leave. On behalf of all the comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China, I would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude and high revolutionary salute to the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and its branches across the country, to the people's governments at all levels, and to all the Chinese brothers and sisters who warmly welcomed us during our activities!

We have been in China for more than four months.

Our delegation has visited Beijing, the capital of China, as well as major administrative regions such as North China, Southwest China, Northwest China, Central South China, East China, and Northeast China. Our delegation participated in a total of 5,241 welcoming rallies, gave briefings, and had a total audience of 32,200,8,152 people. We organized 281 broadcast rallies, with an organized audience of 12.32 million. In addition, through individual conversations, symposiums, and reporting, we introduced the heroic reality of the fighting Korean people to the entire Chinese people, exposed the atrocities of American imperialism, and promoted the growing combat power and revolutionary friendship and unity between Korea and China.

During this period, our delegation clearly saw that, after the Soviet October Revolution, the 500 million Chinese people, who once again created a great achievement in world history, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, with unprecedented unity and unparalleled patriotism, were solemnly advancing in the struggle to build a new democracy and move towards socialism.

At the same time, we also saw that all aspects of the work of the 500 million Chinese people were carried out under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea! Even innocent children like to sing songs about resisting America and aiding Korea. Every mountain, every river, every tree, and every stone in China are contributing to the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

Everywhere, the people enthusiastically welcomed us with colorful red flags, bouquets, waist drum teams, and cheers and embraces. After listening to our reports, their determination to resist America and aid Korea became stronger, and they strengthened the firm fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China with a new and firm fighting will. Whenever the women in various places heard about the atrocities of the American imperialists, they said to us, "Send the orphans here, and we will take care of them." We believe that this is the true and sincere feeling of the 500 million Chinese people. This deep concern is a great encouragement to every representative of Korea.

From the moment our delegation boarded the Mao Zedong train at Fengtai Station on January 18, we were immersed in the warm welcome of the two million people of the great Chinese capital and the entire Chinese people. On May 23, our Korean People's Delegation to China and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation met Chairman Mao Zedong, the great and wise leader of the Chinese people, with incomparable excitement, and all the representatives regarded this as the supreme honor. At this meeting, Chairman Mao gave us earnest encouragement and praised the heroic struggle of the Korean people. All the Chinese people, just as their leader said, welcomed us with unparalleled enthusiasm in all the cities and villages throughout China, starting with Beijing, wherever our delegation went!

On January 28, a Spring Festival get-together was held in Zhongshan Park in Beijing. The masses welcomed our delegation with unprecedented enthusiasm. On this day, the representatives were covered with various medals, commemorative badges, labor model badges, and red scarves presented by the people.

Of course, such a warm welcome was not only here, but everywhere we went. In particular, thousands of children warmly welcomed us everywhere by tying the honorable red scarf around our necks. The people of Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, in the southwestern region, decided to repair the highway that had been under construction for twelve years during the Chiang Kai-shek era, using 10 million workers, without completing it, passing through Gaoligong Mountain, which is 3,500 meters above sea level and 146 kilometers long, after hearing the news that the delegation was coming. This project started in November and was scheduled to be completed before March 10. The people of the whole county showed unparalleled enthusiasm to welcome the delegation and completed it ten days ahead of schedule. On the day of welcoming the delegation, the county people transported white sand from the riverbank five miles away and paved it on the highway, allowing our delegation to pass through that "virgin highway" in the midst of flying snowflakes.

Yang Mianjin (20 years old), a female migrant worker who participated in the road construction project, received a letter stating, "The wedding date has arrived, and you must hurry home!" But she said, "Marriage is certainly a good thing, but it is even more glorious to repair this road to welcome the delegation. The wedding date can be postponed, but the arrival date of the heroes cannot be delayed." At this time, she still did not go home and continued to work on road construction.

The people of Xinhua County, Hunan Province, the hometown of the great internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, built a pine gate at the entrance of the city to welcome our delegation, decorated with portraits of General Kim Il-sung, Chairman Mao, Marshal Stalin, and the national flags of Korea and China, and welcome slogans. The streets were filled with thousands of people, led by dozens of waist drum teams, giving us twenty-six pennants and many gifts. Among these masses were the parents of the late Comrade Luo Shengjiao, who came from seventy miles away. They stood at the front of the crowd, waving flags and cheering us, which truly brought tears to our eyes and made us grateful. Our delegation held a memorial service for the late Comrade Luo Shengjiao here, praising and cherishing the great achievements of the late Comrade Luo Shengjiao, who became an eternal and immortal brilliant pyramid in the tradition of revolutionary friendship between the people of Korea and China. Our delegation visited Shaoshan Township, the hometown of Chairman Mao, on February 16.

The wind and snow were fierce that day, the first time in more than a decade in Hunan, but we set off to Shaoshan Township early in the morning with incomparable excitement. When we arrived about seventy miles away from Shaoshan Township, every village was crowded with militiamen, children, and farmers who came to welcome us, all sweeping away the snow. When we were ten miles away from Shaoshan, model worker Liu Xiuhua and many other men and women ran over together, not afraid of the wind, snow, and slippery roads, and carried us all the way to Shaoshan.

As mentioned above, the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in welcoming the Korean representatives is boiling everywhere, from the broad plains to the vast frontiers. These beautiful and vivid facts are the manifestation of the fighting friendship between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood through long-term revolutionary struggles. And it is the concrete manifestation of the noble internationalist thought that has been further consolidated and united in the flames of the just struggle to defeat the common enemy—American imperialism.

Dear 500 million brothers and sisters, comrades-in-arms, and comrades!

The people of Korea and China not only stand closely together today in the struggle against American imperialists, but also have close political and cultural relations as early as thousands of years ago in the Han, Tang, Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. In the past hundred years, we have been in the same fate under imperialist aggression. Especially in the arduous struggle against Japanese imperialist aggressors, we fought together, shed blood, and resisted the brutal common enemy—Japanese imperialism, side by side. Precisely because of this, there is the blood of Korean patriotic martyrs in the five-star red flag of the People's Republic of China.

The fighting friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood through long-term revolutionary struggles, has been further united in the process of resisting American imperialist aggression. This is a fortress of peace that no imperialist aggression forces can destroy.

The movement to resist America and aid Korea carried out by the great Chinese people is one of the main sources of confidence, will, and power for our Korean people. We clearly see the great contributions made by our 500 million comrades-in-arms, who are constantly advancing in the high tide of resisting America and aiding Korea, to world peace.

Advanced workers in all state-owned factories, enterprises, mines, transportation, post and telecommunications, and other departments in the Northeast, the center of China's industrial development, enthusiastically responded to the "June 1st" call and stood at the forefront of the nation's workers, planning to increase production and save 5 million tons of grain by the end of 1951 to support the front lines. As a result, by the end of September, they had increased production equivalent to 10 million tons of grain, which made a great contribution to increasing national wealth and strengthening the power of resisting America and aiding Korea. Just based on the original planned 5 million tons of grain, calculated at the original price of 630,000 yuan per ton in the Northeast, it could purchase 2,100 fighter jets.

Workers in Shandong Province in East China, after the "June 1st" call, issued a call to the people of the province to establish a "Shandong Provincial Air Force Division" and demonstrated a model role with practical actions. The entire people enthusiastically responded to this call. As of January this year, they had donated 193 aircraft, exceeding the original by 63 aircraft. Workers at the Huafeng Paper Mill in Hangzhou donated three fighter jets through bonuses and part of their wages earned through increased production and savings in the second half of 1951.

The patriotic teenager Zhou Qigang is only eleven years old this year. He is studying in a primary school in Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province. He gloriously joined the Young Pioneers on June 1 last year. Encouraged by unlimited glory after joining the team, he constantly strived to maintain and promote glory. He enthusiastically responded to the "June 1st" call. His family spent 100 yuan a day to buy water, and he decided to fetch it himself. He carried it three or four times a day from a place three miles away, thus completing the saving plan.

Wugunishahan, a 103-year-old Uygur woman from the minority ethnic group in Xi'an, spun yarn every day for resisting America and aiding Korea, donating a total of 900,000 yuan. Chang Xiangyu, a patriotic artist in Xi'an, mobilized all members of the troupe, overcame many difficulties after six months of struggle, and donated the glorious Xiangyu Troupe fighter jet as planned. In addition to the facts mentioned above, we have also heard or witnessed many stories circulating among the Chinese people on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea.

These are all brilliant epics in the revolutionary history of Korea and China, fighting together on the same anti-aggression front. Please allow me, on behalf of all the Korean people, to once again express our warm gratitude and express our comradely praise to the 500 million Chinese people.

Visiting the wounded and sick soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are recuperating in China and the families of the Volunteer Army is a major part of our delegation's work. This visit greatly contributed to the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the people of Korea and China.

All the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army are always thinking of the Korean front. Their only wish is to recover as soon as possible and return to the front. Many wounded and sick soldiers unanimously demanded: return to the front, and bless the Korean People's Army nurses and dear old ladies and children who gave them blood transfusions.

Liu Yunting, an elderly Volunteer Army family member in Xi'an, has one son and two daughters who have all volunteered to join the army. The agreement made by the father and children reads: "You strive for merit on the front lines, and I strive for merit in the rear. When you return victoriously, we will meet at the station with pride in our hearts, under the brilliant five-star red flag." He always adhered to this determination, working hard without sleep or rest, and always donating 1,000 yuan in savings every day, now donating nearly 200,000 yuan in Renminbi.

What particularly moved our delegation was that the Volunteer Army families, who were warmly cared for by the People's Government and the nearby people, regarded it as the supreme glory for their children or loved ones to kill the enemy in Korea, and they used this glory to encourage themselves to strive to be models in various struggles in the rear. The heroic fighting spirit of all the Volunteer Army families in China moved each of us. Our delegation would like to take this opportunity to bid farewell to China and once again express the gratitude and respect of the entire Korean people to all the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army and the families of the Volunteer Army!

Through the fiercely developing "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns throughout the country, we clearly saw that new heroic figures of the Mao Zedong era are constantly emerging.

Kuang Xiu?, a thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer of Liyi Middle School in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, reported his merchant father who had formed an alliance with illegal capitalists and refused to confess. Xu Yulan, a member of the Youth League in Mingxian Middle School in Changsha City, also rose up to report her father, a corrupt element who refused to confess. These examples are too numerous to mention.

The class consciousness of store employees was unprecedentedly raised through the "Five-Anti" campaign. Among the 70,000 store employees in Tianjin, 95% actively participated in the struggle of the Five-Anti campaign, and more than 9,000 store employees participated in the tiger-hunting team and inspection team. As of mid-April, they had reported more than 84,000 cases of theft by illegal merchants, including 1,000 large tigers with more than 100 million yuan.

The period when our delegation carried out its work was precisely the period when the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns entered their climax. We also paid special attention to linking our work with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, which are of great significance. We can say without hesitation that our work has had a certain influence, whether tangible or intangible. For example, when 70,000 store employees in Guangzhou City listened to the delegation's report, they wrote more than 20,000 letters of accusation on the spot, accusing illegal capitalists and corrupt elements of criminal acts.

The rampant attacks of the illegal bourgeoisie and the removal of the five poisons of illegal industrialists and businessmen in the Three-Anti movement—Five-Anti movement have made the leading position of the working class more consolidated.

Recently, state-owned department stores across the country have greatly reduced the prices of daily necessities, which is the material evidence of the victory of this movement.

The great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements fully illustrate that private industrialists and businessmen can only develop normally under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy. Our delegation would like to take this opportunity to bid farewell to China and extend our warm comradely congratulations to the activists who have played a model leading role on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" fronts! And we believe that the victory of this movement will be further consolidated in the future.

We also saw that the so-called economic blockade by the American imperialist aggressors did not hinder the revival and development of the national economy of the People's Republic of China. Contrary to the expectations of the aggressors, the Chinese economy has eliminated the past semi-colonial dependence. Like dense forests, factories erected everywhere are producing large quantities of the latest metal cutting machine tools, motors, agricultural machinery, and various machines for mining and irrigation, and their quality is very good. We are truly in awe.

In the first half of 1951, 2,233,887 people participated in the patriotic labor competition. In the past year alone, there were more than 147,670 various inventions and rationalization proposals. This is the practical proof of the Chinese working class's fiery enthusiasm for increasing production and their patriotic dedication, and it is a powerful guarantee for China to move towards great industrialization.

We clearly saw that slogans of resisting America and aiding Korea and strengthening production were posted next to every factory gate, wall, and machine.

We also clearly heard:

"The factory is the battlefield, and the machine is the weapon."

"Produce one more iron bar, pull out one more bone from the American emperor."

"Weave one more foot of cloth, peel off one more layer of skin from the American emperor." These are the fighting slogans of the Chinese working class, like a volcanic eruption, in the great production increase movement, to fight back against the American aggressors.

The fact that a more intense production increase struggle was launched after listening to our report made us feel more grateful and excited.

The 801 crew of the Sujiatun Agency District of the Fourth Branch of the Northeast China Railway was greatly moved after listening to the delegation's report. From 15:25 on April 21 to 15:25 on April 23, in 48 hours, they took turns driving 1,220 kilometers, setting a new national record. The second team of the National Day Brigade of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine of the State-owned Huainan Mining Bureau collectively excavated a total of 19,447 tons of coal in March, setting a new Chinese record. After hearing the representatives' report this time, they mined an additional 20,077 tons of coal. In addition, the moving stories of the Chinese working class giving great combat support to the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army through the delegation are too numerous to mention.

Our delegation would like to take this opportunity to bid farewell to China and express our highest respect and congratulations to the Chinese working class and all working people who are bravely fighting on the production increase front!

Dear brothers, comrades-in-arms, and comrades:

We also saw that, except for the minority areas, a large-scale land reform unprecedented in China's history was carried out in the rural areas of China according to the wishes of the farmers for thousands of years. This means that the feudal land ownership system and the feudal ruling system have been eliminated, and the victory of the Chinese revolution is becoming more and more consolidated. Farmers have been given land and have participated in the regime themselves, and their farming methods are improving by leaps and bounds. Farmers are singing about the bountiful harvest in the fertile fields, and beautiful flowers of happiness are blooming in their lives.

As the masters of the land, the farmers' enthusiasm for increasing production and their patriotic enthusiasm under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea are extremely high, which can be fully illustrated by the patriotic high-yield model farmers and various struggles in the rural areas that we directly saw.

The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Group in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, is composed of 23 households. They have achieved a miraculous high yield of 210% higher than before the war from 224 mu of arable land. The Yang Zhenru Team of the Dachenzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, has a total of eight households. They produced an average of 1,620 catties per mu from 83 mu of paddy fields, achieving an amazing figure. The Jin Shilong Production Cooperative in Yanji County, Jilin Province, is composed of 22 households. They produced an average of 417 catties of grain per mu from 655 mu of arable land, which means that they exceeded production by 65% compared to 1950.

The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Group in Quzhuangtou Village, Jiexian County, Shanxi Province, produced an average of 549 catties of cotton from 548 mu of cotton land. Qu Yaoli personally created a new record of producing 912 catties per mu.

In this way, the total agricultural output of China in 1951 increased by 107% compared to 1950, and the cotton output in 1951 increased by 140.7% compared to 1950. Taking the increase in oil crops as an example, it increased by 1.27% compared to 1950. The above facts fully illustrate the leaping development of the new Chinese rural economy.

China was originally an agricultural country. However, there was insufficient grain during the Kuomintang rule. Today, China can not only be self-sufficient in grain, but also export it. At the same time, industrial raw materials such as cotton can also be self-sufficient. Because of this, the material foundation for great industrialization is gradually increasing.

All Chinese patriotic farmers who will forever be the masters of the land! Let the flowers of happiness bloom in the boundless paradise—the land of great China!

On the high-yield front, let the brilliant light of victory continue to illuminate your progress!

We know that in the huge production increase movements in industry and agriculture, the material and cultural living standards of workers, farmers, and civil servants will keep pace with each other and rise day by day!

The consumption of cotton cloth in the entire Northeast region was 800,000 pieces in 1947 and has increased to 1,100,000 pieces in 1951, which means that it has increased by 14 times in just five years. This fact undeniably proves the rapid rise in people's living standards. In particular, the adult education for workers and farmers is developing by leaps and bounds, which is another amazing fact.

In 1951, the number of workers receiving education in adult schools reached 1.78 million, which is equivalent to 224% of 1949. It is said that illiteracy among all industrial workers in the country will be completely eliminated within the next two or three years, which is a great leap forward for the cultural development of the new China. The expansion of various school education institutions from primary schools to universities and the development of literary and artistic movements, especially the vigorous expansion of the publishing industry, have enabled us to learn many things.

We know that the great power of the 500 million Chinese people, who are rich in resources, love labor, and have valuable revolutionary experience, is endless.

Today, the Chinese people, just as they won victories in the armed struggle in the past, are also victoriously and solemnly advancing in the struggle for economic construction and various constructions!

In the economic field, due to the power of the strong leading state-owned economic sector, the sluggishness during the Kuomintang rule has been eliminated, and emerging industries have developed rapidly. In particular, the production departments of black metal, textiles, machinery, and electricity are shining with the socialist victory in higher achievements.

The rapid development and victory in all aspects of the People's Republic of China have emerged in the world with the image of a strong country. The gradual consolidation and strengthening of the People's Republic of China and the consolidation and strengthening of the world peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union are a firm guarantee for our Korean people to win the final victory in the great war of liberation of the motherland and build an independent, free, and unified new Korea. Precisely because of this, the Korean people hope and bless the prosperity and strength of the great neighboring country, the brotherly ally country—the People's Republic of China—as if it were their own business!

We have seen that the Chinese people's international friendship and unity with the Korean people is becoming stronger and stronger, which gives us a more solid confidence in victory.

Our Korean People's Delegation to China will certainly convey the brilliant victories and solemn leaps achieved by the new China on all fronts to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, thereby further enhancing their fighting will and confidence in victory. We are determined to respond to our great neighboring country, the dear ally country—the People's Republic of China—with the practical action of more bravely eliminating the enemy on the front lines and striving for the final victory.

Despite the American imperialists' unreasonable behavior at the armistice talks and their use of inhuman bacteriological weapons, the peace-loving people of Korea and China are fully confident in their ability to strive for lasting peace with their own strength.

The victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the Korean people, and the victory of the Korean people is also the victory of the Chinese people. Our victory is also the victory of the peace-loving people all over the world. Victory on the front lines of resisting American imperialist aggression will forever belong to us! No matter what sinister means and methods the American aggressors use, they cannot change their path to failure.

If the American aggressors do not take practical actions to stop their acts of aggression, the people of Korea and China cannot relax their severe blows against them for a moment, and the enemy will suffer more terrible and heavier losses.

Although there are still many difficulties ahead of us, as our leader General Kim Il-sung said: "The way to overcome these many difficulties is the way to strive for victory!"

This is the road that the Korean people are taking today. The Korean people never feel lonely standing on this road.

Because although there are differences in skin color, language, and beliefs, all peace-loving and conscientious people around the world have repeatedly expressed their support for us. Our power is stronger than that of imperialism, and victory will surely belong to us!

Let us shout: In this team, there is heroic Korea, which has pushed the common enemy of mankind—the American aggressors—into the abyss of terror and defeat, and stands tall with a hundred times unparalleled heroic spirit!

Glory to our leader General Kim Il-sung!

Let us shout, in this team there is the great new China, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, which has appeared in world history with invincible power to safeguard the peace of the Far East and mankind. With selfless internationalist spirit, it is assisting the Korean people under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea!

Glory to the great Chairman Mao Zedong!

Let us shout, in this team there is the bastion of the great international democratic camp, illuminating the future of mankind, advancing towards the victory of communism, and suppressing the world imperialist war group—the Soviet Union, as well as the people of the people's democratic countries!

Glory to the great Marshal Stalin!

All Chinese brothers and sisters, I hope that you will consolidate the victory of the Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns in the patriotic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and further promote the lofty and honorable spirit of the Mao Zedong era for the construction of the New Democracy and the victory of socialism!

I wish you more courageous advancement! Advance! Advance again!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood in the long revolutionary struggle!

Long live the leader of the Chinese people's revolution, the helmsman of the Chinese people's march towards victory, the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the organizer, inspirer, and guarantor of the Korean people's victory, the Korean Workers' Party!

Long live the great Chinese people's movement to resist America and aid Korea, one of the important sources of the Korean people's confidence, will, and power in victory!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

Long live the eternal victory of the people of Korea and China!

    朝鲜人民访华代表团洪淳哲团长在首都各界人民欢送大会上的答词
    亲爱的中国的首都北京市和中国兄弟姊妹们，战友们，同志们！
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，前来访问了我们亲爱的邻邦——伟大的中华人民共和国，现在我们完成了所负的任务，就要和这依依难舍的地方告别了。我代表朝鲜人民访华代表团的全体同志，谨向在我们进行活动的期间给予我们诚心帮助的中国人民抗美援朝总会和它的各地分会，各地人民政府以及热烈欢迎我们的全中国兄弟姊妹们，致以衷心的感谢和崇高的革命敬礼！
    我们来到中国，已经四个多月了。
    我们代表团曾经分别访问了中国首都北京以及华北、西南、西北、中南、华东、东北等各大行政区。我们代表团一共参加了五、二四一次的欢迎大会，作了访问报告，听众的总数达三千二百二十万零八千一百五十二人。组织广播大会二八一次，有组织的听众总数为一、二三二万。此外还通过个别谈话、座谈会、报道工作，向全中国人民介绍了战斗着的朝鲜人民的英雄实况，揭露了美帝国主义的兽行，并且宣扬了日益壮大的朝中两国的战斗威力和革命的友谊团结。
    在这个期间，我们代表团很清楚地看到了在苏联十月革命后，又一次在世界历史上，创立了伟大事绩的五万万中国人民，在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，以历史上未曾有的统一团结，和无比的爱国主义精神，在胜利地建设新民主主义和走向社会主义的斗争中庄严前进着。
    同时我们又看到了五万万中国人民各方面的工作又都是在抗美援朝的旗帜下进行的！甚至天真的小朋友也都最喜欢唱抗美援朝的歌子，中国的一山、一水、一木、一石亦都是为了支援抗美援朝的胜利而贡献着力量。
    各地方人民，到处都以五色灿烂的红旗、花束、腰鼓队、欢呼拥抱，来热情地迎接了我们，他们听取了我们的报告以后，抗美援朝的决心更加强了，他们都以新的坚强的斗争意志来加强朝中两国人民的牢固的战斗友谊。各地方妇女，每当听到美帝国主义者的暴行时，向我们表示：“把孤儿送来由我们来养活他们。”我们认为这是五万万中国人民的真实诚恳心情。这种深厚的关怀，对我们朝鲜的每一个代表都是很大的鼓舞。
    我们代表团从一月十八日在丰台车站乘上毛泽东号列车的那一个瞬间起，就开始投入到伟大的中国首都二百万人民和全中国人民热烈欢迎的怀抱中了。五月二十三日，我们朝鲜人民访华代表团和中国人民志愿军归国代表团，都怀着无比兴奋的心情，见到了中国人民伟大的英明领袖毛泽东主席，全体代表都以此为无尚的光荣。在这席上，毛主席给了我们恳切的勉励并且赞扬了朝鲜人民的英雄斗争。全中国的人民都如同自己的领袖所讲的一样，以北京为首的全中国各个城市和所有的乡村，凡是我们代表团所到之处，都是以无比的热情来欢迎了我们！
    一月二十八日，在北京中山公园，举行了春节联欢大会，群众以空前未有的热情，欢迎了我们代表团，这一天代表们的全身被挂满了人民所赠送的各种奖章、纪念章、劳动模范章和红领巾。
    当然，这样的热烈欢迎，不仅仅是在这里，凡是我们走到的地方没有不是这样的。特别是千千万万的小朋友，到处都把荣誉的红领巾系在我们的脖子上，以此来热烈地欢迎我们。西南地区云南省腾冲县的人民听说代表团要到来的消息后，决定提前修好曾经在蒋介石统治时期，经过十二年的时间，用了一千万个工还没有完成的通过拔海三、五○○公尺高的高黎贡山，全长一四六公里的公路。这个工程，由十一月起着手开工，计划于三月十日前把它修好。全县人民为了迎接代表团发挥了无比的热情，提早十天就完成了。迎接代表团的那一天，县民从五里地外的江边，搬运白砂子铺在公路上，在雪花纷飞之中，让我们代表团通过那条“处女公路”。
    参加修路工程的有一位女民工杨绵今（二十岁）同志，她接到一封信，信上写道“结婚日子已经来到，要赶紧回家！”但是她说：“结婚当然是好事情，把这条公路修好迎接代表团，更是光荣的事情。结婚日子可以推迟，但是英雄们来的日子可不能延期啦”。这时她仍不回家，继续地作修路工作。
    伟大的国际主义战士故罗盛教同志的故乡——湖南省新化县的人民，为了欢迎我们代表团，在城门口搭了个松门，并装饰着金日成将军、毛主席、斯大林大元帅的肖像和朝中两国的国旗和欢迎的标语，满街都是以数十名的腰鼓队为首的数千名的群众，给我们赠送了二十六幅锦旗和许多礼物。在这些群众里，有着从七十里路外来的故罗盛教同志的父母，他们站在群众的最前面，他们拿着旗子向我们欢呼，这真使我们热泪满眶不胜感激。我们代表团，在此地举行了故罗盛教同志的追悼大会。赞扬和追慕了在朝中两国人民革命友谊传统上成为永远不灭的灿烂金字塔的故罗盛教同志的伟勋。我们代表团于二月十六日，访问了毛主席的故乡韶山乡。
    这一天风雪厉害，在湖南来说，十几年来头一次，可是我们一早就怀着无比的兴奋心情向韶山乡出发了。我们到达离韶山乡大约有七十里的地方，每一个村庄都挤满了出来欢迎的民兵、儿童和农民，他们都拿着扫帚来打扫着积雪，到离韶山有十里的地点时，工作模范刘秀华同志以及其他许多男女，一齐跑过来，不怕风雪路滑，把我们一直抬到韶山去了。
    正如以上所说，中国人民欢迎朝鲜代表的热情，从宽广的平原，到辽阔的边疆，到处沸腾着。这些优美生动的事实是我们朝中两国人民经过长期的革命斗争，以鲜血相结成的战斗友谊的表现。并且是在为击败共同敌人——美帝国主义的正义斗争的火焰中，有了进一步巩固和团结的高尚的国际主义思想的具体表现。
    亲爱的五万万兄弟姊妹们、战友们、同志们！
    我们朝中两国人民不但在今天反抗美帝国主义者的斗争中，紧紧地站在一起，早在数千年前即汉、唐、宋、辽、金、元、明、清时代在政治上文化上都有着密切的关系。近百年来我们在帝国主义侵略下，处在同样的命运中，尤其是在反抗日本帝国主义侵略者，而展开的艰苦斗争中，我们共同战斗流血并肩抗击残暴的共同敌人——日本帝国主义。正因为这样，在中华人民共和国的五星红旗里面有朝鲜爱国烈士的鲜血。
    经过长时期的革命斗争，以鲜血来相结成的朝中两国人民的战斗友谊团结，在反抗美帝国主义侵略过程中，更有了进一步的团结，这是任何帝国主义侵略势力都不可能破坏的和平要塞。
    伟大的中国人民进行的抗美援朝运动是我们朝鲜人民的信心、意志、威力的主要源泉之一，我们明确地看到了在抗美援朝的高潮里，在不断前进中的五万万战友们的对世界和平所作的伟大的功绩。
    中国工业发展的中心地区——东北所有的国营工厂、企业、矿山、运输、邮电等部门先进的工人，热烈的响应了“六一”号召，站在全国工人的前头，一九五一年底为止计划增产节约五○○万吨粮食来支援前线。结果，他们截至九月底，一共增产了相当于一、○○○万吨粮食的财富，这样对增加国富上和加强抗美援朝的力量上，实有了莫大的贡献。仅就本来所计划的五○○万吨粮食来说，每吨粮价按东北的原价六三万元来计算的话，可以购买战斗机二、一○○架。
    华东地区的山东省工人，在“六一”号召以后，向全省人民发出要建立“山东省空军师”的号召，并以实际的行动来表示出模范作用，全体人民热烈地响应了这个号召，截至今年一月，已经捐献了一九三架飞机，比原来超过了六三架。杭州市华丰造纸厂的工人，通过一九五一年下半期增产节约而得来的奖金和工资的一部，捐献了三架战斗机。
    爱国少年周其刚今年刚刚十一岁，他在湖南省常德专区一个小学校里读书，于去年六月一日光荣地加入了少年儿童队。他争取入队之后，被无限的光荣所鼓舞，经常为了保持光荣，发扬光荣而不断努力，他热烈的响应了“六一”号召。他家吃水每天花一百元去买，他下了决心自己来挑。每天从三里外的地方，挑来三、四次，这样完成了节约计划。
    西安少数民族维吾尔族吾古尼沙汗是一位一○三岁的老太太，她为了抗美援朝，每天纺线，一共捐献了九○万元；西安的爱国艺人常香玉女士，推动剧社的全体人员，经过六个月的斗争，克服了许多困难，按照原来的计划，捐献了光荣的香玉剧社号战斗机一架。除了以上所说的事实之外，我们还听到或亲眼看到了在抗美援朝战线上，中国人民所流传的许多故事。
    这些都是站在同一条反侵略的战线上，共同战斗着的朝中两国革命历史上的辉煌史诗；请允许我代表全体朝鲜人民，再一次向五万万中国人民表示热烈的感谢，并表示我们战友般的赞誉。
    我们代表团在工作期间，访问归国休养中的中国人民志愿军伤病员和志愿军家属，这是我们工作的主要的一部分，这一次访问大大有助于朝中两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结。
    所有的志愿军伤病员时刻想念着朝鲜前线，他们唯一的愿望是早日恢复健康重返前线。许多伤病员们一致要求：重返前线，并且为那些给自己输血的朝鲜人民军看护员和亲爱的老大娘、小朋友们祝福。
    西安市志愿军家属刘云亭老人，他有一个儿子两个姑娘都自动的参了军，父子们订立的规约写道：“你们在战线上争取立功，我在后方立功，等你们胜利归来的那一天，互相怀着骄傲的心情，在灿烂的五星红旗下，在车站上相逢。”他始终坚持着这个决心，不睡眠不休息的努力奋斗，每天总拿出一千元的储金，现在已经捐献了将近二十万的人民币。
    我们代表团特别感动的是：受到人民政府和附近人民热情照顾的志愿军家属们，他们以自己的儿女或爱人在朝鲜杀敌引为无尚光荣，而且他们用这个光荣策励着自己，要在后方各个斗争中，争取模范。全中国所有志愿军家属的英勇的斗志，感动了我们每一个人。我们代表团借此告别中国的机会，向全体志愿军伤病员和志愿军家属，再度地表示全体朝鲜人民的感谢和敬意！
    我们通过在全国各地炽烈开展着的“三反”“五反”的斗争，明确地看到了毛泽东时代的新的英雄人物在不断地涌现着。
    湖南省衡阳市立一中十三岁的少年队员邝修?检举了与不法资本家订立攻守同盟而拒绝坦白的奸商父亲，长沙市明宪中学许玉兰，青年团员郊戾地也起来检举了死不坦白的贪污分子——自己的父亲。这些例子是举不胜举的。
    经过“五反”斗争店员工人的阶级觉悟，空前的提高了。天津市七万个店员中，占百分之九十五的店员积极的参加了五反运动的斗争，更有九千名的店员工人参加了打虎队和检查组；截至四月中旬，已检举不法商人的盗窃案件达八万四千余件，其中一亿以上的大老虎，达一、○○○个。
    我们代表团进行工作的期间正是“三反”“五反”的斗争进入高潮的时期，我们也特别注意到把我们的工作，与具有莫大意义的“三反”“五反”斗争互相连系起来进行，我们可以毫无踌躇地说，我们的工作有形或无形的是起了一定的影响。比方说广州市七万的店员工人，在听取代表团作报告的时候，当场就写两万多封检举信，检举了不法资本家与贪污分子的犯罪行为。
    在三反运动——五反运动中打退了不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻和清除了不法工商业者的五毒，使工人阶级的领导地位更加巩固了。
    最近全国各地国营百货公司，日用品价格大大的减低，这就是这个运动取得胜利的物质证据。
    伟大的“三反”和“五反”运动，充分地说明私营工商业者必须在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，才能够正常的发展。我们代表团借此告别中国的机会向在“三反”“五反”的战线上，起了模范带头作用的积极分子，致以热烈的战友般的祝贺！并且我们相信这个运动的胜利今后会更进一步的巩固。
    我们还看到了美帝国主义侵略者所谓经济封锁，并没有妨碍中华人民共和国的国家经济的复兴发展，与侵略者的期待恰恰相反，中国经济已经清除了过去那种半殖民地的隶属性。就像密林似的耸立着的各地工厂里，大量的生产着最新式的金属切断工作机、电动机、农业机械，矿山，灌溉用的各种机器，并且它的品质都很好。真使我们敬佩万分。
    在一九五一年上半期，参加爱国劳动竞赛的有二百二十三万三千八百八十七人，在去年一年间就有了十四万七千六百七十多件的各种创造和合理化建议，这就是中国工人阶级烈火般的增产热情，和爱国主义献身性的实证，这是中国走向大工业的有力保证。
    我们很清楚地看到了，不论在那一个工厂门旁、墙壁和机器间都贴着抗美援朝加强增产的标语。
    我们又很清楚地听到了：
    “工厂就是战场，机器就是刀枪。”
    “多出一根铁筋，多抽美帝一根骨。”
    “多织一尺布，多剥美帝一层皮。”这是在伟大的增产运动中，为了回击美国侵略者，像火山爆发似的中国工人阶级的战斗口号。
    听取我们的报告后，更炽烈的展开增产斗争的事实，更使我们感到莫大的感激和兴奋。
    东北中长铁路四分局苏家屯机关区八○一号包乘组，听了代表团的报告之后，大为感动，由四月二十一日十五时二十五分起到二十三日十五时二十五分止，在四十八个小时之间，分三组代行车一、二二○公里，创造了全国新纪录。国营淮南矿务局，九龙岗煤矿国庆大队第二队员，在三月由于他们的集体发动一共挖掘了一九、四四七吨煤，创造了全中国新纪录。这次听到代表们的报告之后，多挖了二○、○七七吨煤。此外：中国工人阶级通过代表团，给予朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的莫大的战斗声援，这一方面的动人故事是不胜枚举的。
    我们代表团，借此告别中国之际，向在增产战线上英勇斗争的中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，致以崇高的敬意和祝贺！
    亲爱的兄弟们、战友们、同志们：
    我们又看到了除了少数民族地区之外，在中国的各地农村，根据农民的几千年来的愿望，进行了空前大规模的土地改革，这意味着封建的土地所有制度和封建统治制度已被消灭，而中国革命的胜利愈加巩固。农民分得土地，并自己参加了政权，而他们的耕作方法在飞跃地改进着。农民们在肥沃的田园里歌颂着丰年，在他们的生活中正开放幸福的美丽的鲜花。
    做为土地主人的农民，在抗美援朝的旗帜下他们的增产热情和爱国热情，极为昂扬，由我们直接看到的爱国丰产模范农民和农村的各种斗争中，就可以充分地说明。
    山西省平顺县李顺达互助组，以二十三户来组成。他们从二二四亩的耕地面积里头取得了比战前提高到百分之二一○的奇迹般的丰产成绩。河北省宁河县大陈庄农业生产合作社杨振儒小队，全队共八个户，从八三亩稻田里头，平均每亩生产一六二○斤，取得了令人惊异的数字。吉林省延吉县，金时龙生产合作社，由二十二户来组成的，从六五五亩地耕地面积里头，每亩平均生产了四一七斤的粮食，这就是说比一九五○年度超额生产了百分之六十五。
    山西省解县曲庄头村曲耀离互助组，全组从五四八亩的棉花地里头，生产了平均五四九斤的棉花，以曲耀离个人来说创造了每亩地生产九一二斤的新纪录。
    这样，一九五一年度的中国农业总生产量比一九五○年提高到百分之一○七，一九五一年度棉花生产量比一九五○年度提高到百分之一四○·七，举油料作物的增产来说，比一九五○年度增加到百分之一·二七，以上的这些事实，充分地说明了新中国农村经济的飞跃的发展情况。
    中国原来是农业的国家。但是国民党统治时期粮食不充足的。今天的中国粮食不仅能够自给自足，而且还能出口，同时棉花等的工业原料亦可以自给自足，由于这样，对大工业化的物质基础在逐渐的增进着。
    永远的作为土地主人的全中国爱国农民们！在宽阔无边的乐园里——伟大中国的土地上，让幸福的鲜花盛开吧！
    在丰产战线上，让灿烂的胜利的光芒，继续照耀着你们前进吧！
    我们知道，在工业和农业巨大的增产运动中工人农民公务员们的物质文化生活水平，将并驾齐驱日益向上！
    全东北地方的棉布消费量，一九四七年度的是八○万匹，一九五一年度已经增加到一、一○○万匹，这就是说，在短短的五年内已经增加到十四倍，这个事实，不可置辩地证明了人民生活水平的急速向上。特别是对工人、农民大众的成人教育在飞跃的发展，这又是一个惊人的事实。
    一九五一年度，在成人学校，受教育的工人数，达一七八万人，相当于一九四九年度的百分之二二四。听说最近二、三年之内要全部消灭全国产业工人中的文盲，这对新中国文化发展上来说真是一个大跃进。从小学起一直到大学，各种学校教育机关的扩大，和文学艺术运动的发展，特别是出版事业的大力扩张，使我们学习到许多东西。
    我们知道资源丰富，热爱劳动，同时具有宝贵的革命经验的五万万中国人民伟大力量是无穷无尽的。
    今天，中国人民如同过去在武装斗争中争取胜利一样，今天亦在为经济建设以及各种建设的斗争中，在胜利地庄严前进着！
    在经济方面由于强大的居领导地位的国营经济部门的威力，清除了在国民党统治时期萎靡不振的现象，新兴的工业迅速地发展起来，尤其是黑金属纺织机械电力等生产部门，在更高的成果里闪耀着社会主义胜利的远景。
    中华人民共和国各方面的突飞猛进的发展和胜利，已经以强国的面貌出现于世界。中华人民共和国的逐渐巩固和强大，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的巩固和强大，乃是我们朝鲜人民争取伟大的祖国解放战争最后胜利、建设独立自由统一新朝鲜的坚强保证。正因为如此，朝鲜人民把伟大的邻邦，兄弟战友之国——中华人民共和国的繁荣富强，如同自己事情一样的在希望着，祝福着！
    我们看到了中国人民对朝鲜人民的国际的友谊团结愈益强大，这使我们有了更坚固的胜利信心。
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，必将新中国在各条战线上所争取的辉煌胜利，和庄严跃进的情形，传达给朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，借此更进一步地提高他们的斗争意志和胜利信心；我们决以在前线更英勇的消灭敌人，争取最后的胜利的实际行动来答复我们伟大的邻邦，亲爱的战友之国——中华人民共和国。
    尽管美帝国主义者在停战谈判会议上蛮横无理，并且还用灭绝人性的细菌武器，但是爱好和平的朝中两国人民，完全有信心以自己的力量来争取持久和平。
    中国人民的胜利也就是朝鲜人民的胜利，朝鲜人民的胜利也就是中国人民的胜利，我们的胜利也就是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利，在抗击美帝国主义侵略战线上的胜利将永远属于我们！美国侵略者们用什么样的毒辣的手段方法，都不能够变更他们走向失败的末路。
    假若美国侵略者，不以实际的行动来停止其侵略罪行的话，朝中两国人民一刻也不能够放松对它们的严重打击，而敌人将遭受到更可怕更惨重的损失。
    我们的前面虽然还有重重的困难，但正如我们的领袖金日成将军所说：“打开这些许多困难的道路，就是争取胜利的道路！”
    这条路就是今天朝鲜人民正在行进的道路，朝鲜人民站在这条路上，始终不感到孤独。
    因为虽然肤色、语言、信仰等有所不同，但全世界一切爱好和平的有良心的人类，都一再地表示要支援我们，我们的力量比帝国主义的强大，胜利一定属于我们！
    我们要高呼：在这个队伍里面，有着把人类的共同敌人——美国侵略者推进到恐怖和败亡的深渊、以百倍无比的英雄气概耸立起来的英雄的朝鲜！
    光荣归于我们的领袖金日成将军！
    我们要高呼，在这个队伍里面有着占全世界人口四分之一为了维护远东与人类和平的以不可战胜的巨力而出现于世界历史上的伟大的新中国。它以忘我无私的国际主义精神在抗美援朝的旗帜下，援助着朝鲜人民！
    光荣归于伟大的毛泽东主席！
    我们要高呼，在这个队伍里面有着照耀着人类的前途，向着建设共产主义的胜利突飞猛进，并压制着世界帝国主义战争集团的伟大的国际民主阵营的堡垒——苏联，以及各人民民主国家的人民！
    光荣归于伟大的斯大林大元帅！
    全中国兄弟姊妹们，希望你们在抗美援朝增产节约的爱国运动中，巩固三反与五反的胜利，为了新民主主义建设和走向社会主义胜利，进一步发扬毛泽东时代的崇高和荣誉吧！
    祝你们更勇敢的前进！前进！再前进！
    在长期革命斗争中以鲜血相结成的朝中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊和团结万岁！
    中国人民革命的领导者、中国人民走向胜利的舵手、伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    朝鲜人民胜利的组织者、鼓舞者、保证者朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    朝鲜人民胜利的信心意志和威力的重要源泉之一的伟大的中国人民抗美援朝运动胜利万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    朝中两国人民永远的胜利万岁！
