    Shandong Normal College's Reply Regarding Reader Criticism of the "Three-Anti" Movement

    Editor: We welcome the concern of Yang Yi and others, expressed in their letter published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on April 18th, which offered opinions on our college's "Three-Anti" work.

    Our college's "Three-Anti" work has many shortcomings. At the beginning of the anti-corruption struggle, the college's leadership had insufficient understanding and serious right-leaning tendencies. Furthermore, the leaders did not have a unified understanding of certain specific issues, which led to slow progress in the movement and resulted in criticism from higher authorities. After the Provincial-Level Organs' Thrift Inspection General Assembly sent people to our college to directly take charge of the movement, the aforementioned problems were overcome and the work proceeded smoothly. As of early April, with the exception of the building construction and instrument procurement inspections, which could not be completed temporarily due to objective reasons and which, according to instructions from the Provincial-Level Organs' Thrift Inspection General Assembly, must be handled as special cases, the corruption problems that existed in other areas have been basically clarified. The General Assembly has ordered us to focus on recovering stolen goods, determining the cases, and conducting the handling, and is preparing to move into the construction phase.

    In the "Three-Anti" movement, the shortcomings and errors exposed in our college's work are very serious. Although the leadership conducted self-criticism at the beginning of the movement, after the "Three-Anti" movement gradually deepened and the shortcomings and errors in the work were thoroughly exposed, the leaders deeply realized the inadequacy of their past self-criticism. In the future construction phase, the leaders will have to re-take the course and conduct further self-criticism.

### 山东师范学院关于“三反”运动对读者批评的答复

    山东师范学院关于“三反”运动对读者批评的答复
    编辑同志：四月十八日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了杨易等的来信，对我院“三反”工作提出了意见。杨易等这样关心我们的“三反”运动，我们是极为欢迎的。
    我院“三反”工作是有很多缺点的。反贪污斗争开始时，我院领导同志认识不足，有严重的右倾思想；领导同志间对某些具体问题的认识又不够一致，以致运动进展很慢，受到了上级的批评。及至省级机关节约检查总会派人来我院直接掌握这一运动以后，上述的毛病得以克服，工作遂顺利地开展。截至四月初，除建筑工程和仪器购置两项检查工作，限于客观原因暂时还不能完成，已经省级机关节约检查总会指示，须作专案处理外，其他方面所存在的贪污问题已基本上弄清。总会已令我们着重追赃定案，进行处理，并准备转入建设阶段。
    在“三反”运动中，我院工作上暴露出的缺点和错误是很严重的。运动开始时，领导方面虽进行了自我检查，但“三反”运动逐步深入开展，工作中的缺点和错误彻底暴露出来以后，领导同志已深知过去检讨之不足。在今后建设阶段，领导同志还要重行补课，作进一步的检查。  山东师范学院
