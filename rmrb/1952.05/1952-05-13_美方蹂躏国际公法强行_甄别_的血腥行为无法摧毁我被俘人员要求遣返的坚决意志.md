Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 12th: The U.S. side's great conspiracy to forcibly detain over 100,000 of our captured personnel has become the sole obstacle hindering the achievement of a ceasefire agreement in Korea. Despite our side's continuous efforts and significant concessions on the issue of prisoner repatriation, the U.S. side has consistently and unreasonably insisted on its absurd "voluntary repatriation" proposal, with the aim of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. In order to achieve this despicable goal, the U.S. side has not hesitated to further trample on international law, using all sorts of brutal methods to conduct so-called "screening" of our captured personnel. The U.S. side attempts to use this fabricated "screening result" as a "fait accompli," forcing our side to accept it, thereby achieving their sinister goal of forcibly detaining a large number of our captured personnel.

In fact, the U.S. side's barbaric measures of forcibly "screening" captured personnel in order to detain them are an unprecedented atrocity. It violates international law, particularly the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, which the U.S. government also signed. There is no provision in the entire Geneva Convention that allows for the so-called "screening" of prisoners of war. On the contrary, it stipulates that all prisoners of war must be repatriated, and this right of prisoners of war and other rights stipulated by the Convention are absolutely not to be arbitrarily deprived. Even British bourgeois public opinion has reminded the United States of this more than once. For example, the "Foreign Report" on April 3 stated: "The relevant articles in the Geneva Convention actually believe that the rights enjoyed by prisoners of war under the Convention shall not be deprived. One of these rights is repatriation." The "Times" on May 8 also acknowledged that "For two hundred years, it has been generally recognized that belligerents should repatriate prisoners of war after the end of the war." The 1949 Geneva Convention "formally made this obligation binding." And now the American aggressors are shamelessly using so-called "screening" to deprive prisoners of war of their legitimate right to repatriation. Is this not a blatant violation of the Geneva Convention? Even the American aggressors themselves cannot deny that the "screening" they are conducting has no legal basis whatsoever. On April 9, a British Reuters reporter asked the U.S. chief negotiator, Joy, what provisions of international law the U.S. side was using to "reclassify" North Korean and Chinese captured personnel through "screening." Joy could not conceal his response: "There is no provision in the Geneva Convention that requires identifying people who were forcibly conscripted into the army." It is abundantly clear that the American aggressors' "screening" is completely unreasonable and thoroughly illegal.

The American aggressors, putting on a "just" and "humanitarian" face, have repeatedly and shamelessly claimed that "screening" our captured personnel is to "respect individual will" and to determine so-called personal "true beliefs." However, the countless bloody tragedies created by the U.S. side for "screening" have shattered its lies. The bloody facts show that the truth of "screening" is that the American aggressors are attempting to destroy the individual will of our captured personnel and to rape their true beliefs through bloody means. To this end, the American aggressors have also recruited Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gang secret agents to force our captured personnel to accept fascist education and participate in reactionary organizations, and forced them to tattoo themselves, write blood oaths, and press blood fingerprints. Some secret agents even dipped their fingers in the blood of our wounded captured personnel and pressed their fingerprints on them. Any resistance from our captured personnel to this was met with all sorts of atrocities such as beatings, scolding, starvation, and murder. The Chiang gang secret agents also openly threatened those of our captured personnel who had been insulted and harmed, saying: "You have been tattooed, there is only death waiting for you if you go back." The American aggressors carried out such a series of inhuman acts in the prisoner-of-war camps before the "screening." The purpose was obviously to try to first intimidate our captured personnel, making them afraid to express their individual will and true beliefs.

And when the "screening" was in progress, a terrifying atmosphere similarly enveloped the prisoner-of-war camps. Even the U.S. side's statements could not conceal this. A statement issued by the U.S. military command in Korea on April 25 revealed that in the twenty-four hours before the "screening," the U.S. military authorities in Korea first created an atmosphere of terror among our captured personnel, saying that they should consider "their own safety," and threatening our captured personnel "not to talk to others about this issue before the individual interviews are held, nor to reveal their decisions." During the "interviews," everyone "was called in separately for secret talks." The "screening" conducted in such a threatening atmosphere was a rape of individual will, not respect for it. What is particularly outrageous is that when such illegal "screening" was met with resistance from our captured personnel, the American aggressors ruthlessly used collective massacre methods to eliminate those of our captured personnel who bravely expressed their firm individual will to demand repatriation. The Geoje Island massacres of February 18 and March 13 are recent examples. And when the "screening" failed to achieve the desired results, the American aggressors blatantly disregarded the individual will of our captured personnel, insisting that they "refused repatriation," and arbitrarily removing them from the list of prisoners of war to be repatriated. In fact, the U.S. side's intention to detain a large number of our captured personnel is a predetermined evil plan, and the so-called "screening" is just one of the despicable means to achieve this plan. According to the American "Newsweek" on April 21, the U.S. side's "official list of Communist Chinese prisoners is also gradually being reduced, and Washington hopes it can be further reduced." Isn't it obvious that the "screening" shamelessly flaunted by the American aggressors is actually synonymous with forcible detention?

After the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to use "screening" to detain our captured personnel was powerfully exposed by our side, Ridgway and Truman hurriedly issued statements on May 7, expressing their willingness to allow so-called "appropriate international organizations" to "re-interrogate" those "detained by" the U.S. side after the ceasefire. This is another conspiracy by the American aggressors to deceive the people of the world. The American aggressors are attempting to use "re-interrogation" to secretly legitimize its "screening" and to absolve itself of the crime of violating the Geneva Convention. If the American aggressors are allowed to do so, it would be tantamount to abandoning the Geneva Convention. Moreover, it is well known that the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps are a living hell, and the entire Geoje Island "has become an island of terror." There, secret agents run rampant, and overt and covert threats, persecutions, and even massacres are happening anytime and anywhere. Under these circumstances, our captured personnel under U.S. control have absolutely no real freedom to express their individual will. Apart from the "international institutions" used by the American aggressors, no real international institution is willing to abandon its dignity and go there to endure the American aggressors' deception. The "re-interrogation" lie of Truman and Ridgway is merely a trick to cover up the illegality and hypocrisy of "screening."

The facts are so clearly presented that the U.S. side's so-called "screening" or "re-interrogation" is completely illegal and a despicable deception. The American aggressors must not escape the serious responsibility for violating international law, and must not escape the punishment they deserve.

### 美方蹂躏国际公法强行“甄别”的血腥行为无法摧毁我被俘人员要求遣返的坚决意志

    美方蹂躏国际公法强行“甄别”的血腥行为无法摧毁我被俘人员要求遣返的坚决意志
    【新华社开城十二日电】美方强迫扣留十万以上我方被俘人员的大阴谋，已成为阻挠朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的唯一障碍。尽管我方在遣俘问题上作了不断的努力和巨大的让步，但是，美方却一贯无理坚持其以强迫扣留我方被俘人员为目的的“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。美方为了达到他们这个卑劣的目的，竟不惜进一步蹂躏国际公法，使用种种残暴无比的手段，对我方被俘人员进行所谓“甄别”。美方企图以他们这样一手制造出来的虚构的“甄别结果”，作为“既成事实”，强迫我方接受，从而达到他们强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的阴险目的。
    事实上，美方强行“甄别”被俘以便扣留他们的野蛮措施，是一个史无先例的暴行。它破坏了国际公法，特别是美国政府也签了字的一九四九年的关于对战俘的待遇的日内瓦公约。整个日内瓦公约没有一条准许对战俘进行所谓“甄别”。相反地，它规定战俘必须全部遣返，战俘的这一权利及公约所规定的其他权利是绝对不能任意予以剥夺的。关于这一点，即使是英国资产阶级舆论也已不止一次地提醒美国注意了。例如，四月三日“外事报道”说：“日内瓦公约中有关的条文实际上认为：战俘依该公约规定所享受的权利不得予以剥夺。这些权利之一便是遣返。”五月八日的“泰晤士报”也承认：“两百年来，大家一直公认，在战争结束后，交战国应该遣返战俘。”一九四九年的日内瓦公约“在形式上使这个义务有了约束力”。而现在美国侵略者竟无耻地以所谓“甄别”来剥夺战俘遣返的正当权利，这难道不对日内瓦公约明目张胆的破坏吗？甚至美国侵略者自己也无法抵赖，他们所进行的“甄别”是没有任何法律根据的。四月九日，英国路透社记者曾问美方首席谈判代表乔埃：美方对朝中方面被俘人员进行“甄别”以“重新分类”是根据国际法中的什么条款？乔埃无法掩饰地答道：“日内瓦公约中没有什么条款规定要查明被强迫征入军队的人们。”美国侵略者的“甄别”是毫无任何理由的，是彻头彻尾非法的，这再明白不过的了。
    美国侵略者装出一副“公正”、“人道”的面孔，一再无耻谰言对我方被俘人员进行“甄别”是为了“尊重个人意志”，为了决定所谓个人“真正信念”。但是，美方为了“甄别”而制造的无数血腥的惨剧，戳破了它的弥天大谎。血淋淋的事实说明：“甄别”的真相是美国侵略者用血腥的手段来妄图摧毁我们被俘人员的个人意志，来妄图强奸我方被俘人员的真正信念。美国侵略者为此并招来了蒋介石和李承晚匪帮的特务分子，强迫我方被俘人员接受法西斯教育和参加反动组织，并且强迫他们刺字、写血书、按血指印，有的特务分子甚至用自己的手指蘸着被打伤的我方被俘人员的血按上自己的指印。我方被俘人员对此一有反抗，打、骂、饿、杀种种暴行随之而来。蒋匪特务并且公然对那些被侮辱和被损害的我方被俘人员恫吓说：“你们已被刺字，回去只有死路一条。”美国侵略者在“甄别”之前就在战俘营中作了这样一系列惨无人道的勾当，其目的显然是妄图首先吓倒我方被俘人员，使他们不敢表示个人意志和真正信念。
    而在“甄别”进行时，恐怖的气氛同样地笼罩着战俘营，甚至美方的声明都不能掩饰这一点。侵朝美军司令部四月二十五日的声明透露，在进行“甄别”以前的二十四小时中，侵朝美军当局首先即在我方被俘人员中制造恐怖空气，说什么要考虑“自己的安全”，恫吓我方被俘人员“在未举行个别谈话以前不要和别人谈这个问题，也不要透露他们的决定”。在进行“谈话”时，每一个人“都被分别叫去进行秘密谈话”。在这种威胁恫吓的气氛之下进行的“甄别”，是个人意志遭到了强奸，而不是尊重。尤其令人发指的是，当这样的非法“甄别”遭到我方被俘人员的反抗时，美国侵略者竟狠毒地用集体屠杀的方法来消灭这些勇敢地表示要求遣返的坚强个人意志的我方被俘人员。二月十八日和三月十三日的巨济岛惨案，都是最近的例子。而当“甄别”未能获得预期的效果时，美国侵略者更悍然不顾我方被俘人员的个人意志，硬说他们“拒绝遣返”，擅自把他们从应遣返的战俘名单中删去。事实上，美方要扣留大批我方被俘人员是美方既定的罪恶计划，所谓“甄别”只不过是为实现这个计划的卑鄙手段之一而已。据美国“新闻周刊”四月二十一日透露，美方的“共军俘虏正式名单也在逐渐削减中，华盛顿希望它能够进一步减少”。美国侵略者所无耻炫耀的“甄别”实际上就是强行扣留的代名词，这难道还不明显吗？
    在美国侵略者企图利用“甄别”扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋被我方有力地揭穿以后，李奇微和杜鲁门在五月七日又急忙发表声明，表示愿意在停战后让所谓“适当的国际组织”，对被美方“拘留的那些人重新进行询问”。这是美国侵略者又一个企图欺骗世界人民的阴谋。美国侵略者企图用“重新进行询问”来偷偷摸摸地使它的“甄别”成为合法。来为它破坏日内瓦公约的罪行解脱。如果容许美国侵略者这样做，那就等于毁弃日内瓦公约，而且，尽人皆知，美方的战俘营是一个人间地狱，整个巨济岛“变成了一个恐怖之岛”。在那里，特务横行，明的和暗的威胁、迫害以至屠杀随时随地在发生着。在这种情况之下，在美国控制下的我方被俘人员是断无表示个人意志的真正自由的。除了美国侵略者御用的“国际机构”以外，是没有任何一个真正的国际机构愿意毁弃自己的尊严，到那里去忍受美国侵略者的愚弄的。杜鲁门和李奇微之流的“重新进行询问”的谎言，不过是掩饰“甄别”的非法性和虚伪性的花招而已。
    事实是如此明白地摆着，美方所谓“甄别”或“重新进行询问”，是完全非法的，是一个卑鄙的骗局。美国侵略者决不能逃避破坏国际公法的严重罪责，决不能逃避它应得的制裁。
