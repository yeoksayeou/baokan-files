    Don't Waste Talent, Don't Bury Talent
  　Tang Shaoli
    Our great motherland is about to begin large-scale construction. Even in this preparation period, we already feel the lack of technical talent. In this situation, all technical personnel should use what they have learned and make the best use of their talents, engaging in the work they are good at. However, this is not always the case. Some technical personnel are currently engaged in work they are not good at. For example, in the agricultural and forestry department of a certain county in Hunan, the two veterinarians hired only know how to use traditional methods of acupuncture and bloodletting, and have very little scientific knowledge, so they cannot use the epidemic prevention drugs issued by higher authorities. However, in the tax bureau, there is a veterinarian who graduated from university and has two years of practical experience doing clerical and statistical work. The agricultural and forestry department has requested his transfer several times, but the tax bureau refuses to release him. The reason is simple: the tax bureau "needs" this person for its work. The same situation exists in the grain bureau: a cadre who graduated from a higher industrial school majoring in dyeing and weaving is doing accounting work in the bureau. When he was originally working in the grain bureau of the special commissioner's office, the enterprise department of the special commissioner's office's finance and economy committee had once tried to transfer him, but the grain bureau of the special commissioner's office also refused, citing the "needs of the work" of the unit. In the grain bureau, there are also two staff members who attended higher agricultural schools but did not graduate. In the trade company, there are people who can drive cars. Although no unit has requested their transfer, agricultural technicians and tractor drivers are in short supply nationwide, but they are now "using skills they didn't learn." They are very eager to engage in their own fields, but because of "work needs," there is no way.
    The above is the situation in small places and small units. Large units also have this situation. In a report, Comrade Deng Zihui criticized a certain department in Central and South China for assigning college students assigned to the department to do receiving and dispatching work.
    The above situation is not isolated. One reason for this phenomenon is that at the beginning of liberation, the political departments needed a lot of people. Many of the old technical personnel who participated in various revolutionary universities and training classes for transformation were assigned to political departments after graduation. Another reason is that the personnel departments did not do a good job of using cadres according to their abilities. Third, there are restrictions on time and geographical conditions. For example, place A has factories and lacks talent, while place B may have talent but lacks factories. Once personnel are settled, it is more difficult to transfer them. Some cadres request to be transferred, or other units request the transfer of certain staff members, but the leading cadres of the unit only emphasize their own work needs and refuse to let them go. Cadres who request a transfer are even criticized. Of course, revolutionary work is glorious, and it is all revolutionary work everywhere. Revolutionary cadres should not emphasize personal interests and should unconditionally obey organizational assignments. This is the basic condition for a revolutionary cadre. However, leading cadres should consider how to give full play to the cadres' strengths and assign work appropriately according to their abilities. If something can be done by someone with an elementary school education, don't assign a college student to do it. If the unit cannot use someone, give them to another unit. Don't waste talent on small jobs, and don't waste and bury talent without considering the overall situation.
    I hope that the relevant departments and leading organs will pay attention to this issue, appropriately carry out a cadre adjustment and a general talent discovery work under possible conditions, so as to give play to potential human resources. I believe that before a large number of construction talents are trained, the existing talents, if used appropriately, can meet the urgent needs.

### 不要浪费人才，埋没人才

    不要浪费人才，埋没人才
  　唐绍礼
    我们伟大的祖国即将开始大规模的建设。现在虽还在准备时期，可是已感到技术人才的缺乏了。在这种情形下，所有技术人员理应学以致用、人尽其才，从事他们所擅长的工作。但是，事实却不尽如此。现在有些技术人员正从事于他所不擅长的工作。如湖南某县农林科聘到的两位兽医，只会用土办法扎针放血，科学知识很少，以致不能使用上级发下来的防疫药品。但在税务局里，却有一个兽医大学毕业、并有两年实际工作经验的人在搞文书统计工作。农林科请调几次，税务局都不给。理由很简单：因为税务局“工作需要”这个人。在粮食局也有这种情形：一个高等工业学校毕业的学染织的干部在该局搞会计工作。他原先在专署粮食局工作的时候，专署财政经济委员会企业处就曾经调过他，但专署粮食局同样以本机关“工作需要”为理由，拒绝了。在粮食局还有两个高等农业学校肄业的工作人员。在贸易公司有会开汽车的。虽然没有机关要求调他们，但在全国来说，农业技术人才和拖拉机手是缺乏的，而他们现在却“用非所学”。他们很希望搞本行工作，但因为“工作需要”，也没有办法。
    以上是小地方、小机关的情况。大机关也有这种情况。邓子恢同志的一篇报告中，就曾批评中南某部不该让分配到该部的大学生搞收发工作。
    像以上这种情形，并不是个别的。所以造成这种现象的原因，一是在解放之初，政权部门很需要人，参加各种革命大学和训练班进行改造的旧技术人员，毕业后有许多人被分配到政权部门去了。另一个原因是人事部门没有很好地量材使用干部。第三，时间、地域等条件的限制。如甲地有工厂、缺人才，乙地可能有人才、缺工厂。在人员一旦安置好之后，再调动工作就比较困难了。有些干部本人请求调动工作，或其他机关请求调动某某工作人员，本机关的领导干部却只强调自己的工作需要，不肯放。请求调动工作的干部甚至受到批评。固然革命的工作都是光荣的，在那里都是做革命工作，革命干部不应该强调个人兴趣，应该无条件地服从组织分配，这是作为一个革命干部的起码条件。但领导干部却应该考虑如何发挥干部的特长，按其才能适当地分配工作。本来一个有小学文化程度的人就可以做得了的事，就不要分配一个大学生去做。本机关用不了的，就给别的机关。不要大才小用，不照顾全面地浪费和埋没人才。
    我希望有关部门和领导机关注意这一问题，在可能条件下适当地进行一次干部调整和普遍地发掘人才的工作，以发挥潜在的人力。我相信在没有培养出大批建设人才之前，现有的人材，如能适当使用，是可以应付急需的。
