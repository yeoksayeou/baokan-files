    Circular of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on Promoting the “Rapid Literacy Method” Among Workers

    I. The "Rapid Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua has proven to be a good method for quickly eliminating illiteracy in literacy teaching in the army since 1949. Recently, the National Committee of the China Textile Trade Union and the Tianjin Municipal Committee, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union, the Hangzhou Sub-district Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, and the Jinan Municipal Committee of the China Transportation Trade Union, in order to learn from the experience of promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method" among workers, organized professional and amateur "Rapid Literacy Method" experimental classes among textile, railway, and transportation workers. The experimental results are: under normal circumstances, using this method to teach an illiterate worker only requires about 150 hours to recognize 1,500 to 2,000 characters, and another approximately 100 hours to read four to six literacy textbooks. Facts have proven that this "Rapid Literacy Method" is also a good method for quickly eliminating illiteracy among workers. Adopting this method can shorten the time it takes a worker to learn to read by at least ten to fifteen times. This will enable workers to quickly and effectively master the tool of literacy in a short period of time, so as to further improve their political, cultural, and technical level and better exert their creativity and enthusiasm in national defense construction and economic construction. Therefore, organizing and planning the promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method" among workers has become an urgent task in our current workers' cultural education work.

    II. The teaching process of the "Rapid Literacy Method" can be roughly divided into three steps: The first step is to learn phonetic symbols and pinyin to master this auxiliary tool for literacy; the second step is to intensively study new characters, first striving to be able to read and initially explain them; the third step is to study language textbooks, carry out reading, writing, and speaking activities, consolidate the characters that have been learned, and seek further improvement. This is the basic method of the "Rapid Literacy Method." In the process of popularizing it in various places, we must continue to work hard to study, develop, and enrich this literacy method based on the specific conditions of the workers.

    III. According to the existing experience in various places, first, when organizing workers to study using the "Rapid Literacy Method," we must first do a good job in ideological mobilization, use practical examples to illustrate the benefits of the "Rapid Literacy Method," dispel their ideological concerns, and further improve their learning consciousness, initiative, and enthusiasm from a political perspective to strengthen their confidence. Moreover, this ideological mobilization work must be carried out frequently throughout the learning process, targeting the ideological situation of the students. Second, in the teaching process, classes must be organized according to the students' level to avoid affecting the teaching progress and the students' emotions. When lecturing, it is necessary to connect with reality, prepare lessons before class, and allow some students to participate in order to solve problems in teaching in a timely manner and meet the needs of the students. This requires teachers to highly exert their leadership role and the students' consciousness, correctly grasp the teaching progress, and seize the teaching time. Third, we must pay attention to consolidating the students' learning results. The main method of consolidation is to read a large number of popular readings after the intensive study of new characters. Therefore, before the students graduate, in addition to providing them with a large number of popular books and newspapers, they should also be taught how to use dictionaries, assign review homework, launch mutual correspondence, and write articles for wall newspapers to continuously improve.

    IV. According to facts and experience, we can affirm that it is an urgent matter to universally promote the "Rapid Literacy Method" in vocational and spare-time schools across the country. However, our experience is not specific or systematic enough. Therefore, before universally promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method," there must first be a period of extensive experimentation in order to gain experience for universal promotion. Therefore, it is stipulated that:

    First, in order to effectively promote the "Rapid Literacy Method" among workers, cadres of the cultural and educational departments of trade unions at all levels must first learn phonetic symbols and pinyin and should study the basic methods and existing experience of the "Rapid Literacy Method."

    Second, the cultural and educational departments of municipalities directly under major administrative regions, municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, and industrial trade unions should designate special personnel to be responsible for cooperating with local government education departments under the leadership of the Party during the four months of May, June, July, and August to formulate specific plans, do a good job in preparation, obtain the cooperation of administrative and youth leagues, and organize at least one "Rapid Literacy Method" experimental class (the number of people will be determined based on the specific situation) to gain practical experience.

    Third, during the experimental period, ten to twenty local vocational and spare-time school teachers should be concentrated to participate in the experiment in order to lay the foundation for the universal training of teachers.

    Fourth, during the experimental period, trade union newspapers, local newspapers, and other propaganda tools should be used to widely publicize the promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method" and experimental experiences should be introduced in a timely manner.

    Fifth, during the experimental period, various localities should regularly summarize experience and report it level by level. The cultural and educational departments of trade unions in major administrative regions and provinces should designate special personnel to regularly organize and inspect the progress of this work.

    Sixth, in August, various localities will conduct experimental summaries and formulate plans for the universal promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method" and report them to the Cultural and Educational Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in order to formulate a national promotion plan.

    V. The promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method" will have extremely significant meaning and effect on our vocational and spare-time education; and in terms of teaching methods, it will also lead to more experience. It is hoped that trade unions in various localities will conduct experiments quickly after receiving this notice, in conjunction with local conditions.

### 中华全国总工会关于在工人中推行“速成识字法”的通知

专栏：

    中华全国总工会关于在工人中推行“速成识字法”的通知
    一、祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”，从一九四九年以来，在部队识字教学中，证明是迅速扫除文盲的良好方法。最近中国纺织工会全国委员会与天津市委员会、纺织工会重庆市委员会、中国铁路工会杭州分区委员会、中国搬运工会济南市委员会，为了吸取在工人群众中推广“速成识字法”的经验，分别在纺织、铁路、搬运工人中组织了专业的和业余的“速成识字法”实验班，实验结果是：在一般情况下，对一个工人文盲，采用这种方法教学，只要一百五十小时左右的时间，就能认识一千五百字到两千字，再有大约一百小时，就可以读完识字课本四本到六本。事实证明，这种“速成识字法”同样是迅速扫除工人中文盲的良好方法。采用这种方法，使一个工人学会文字的时间至少可以缩短十倍到十五倍。这样就能使工人在短时间内迅速地有效地掌握文字工具，以便进一步提高他们的政治、文化与技术水平，在国防建设、经济建设中更好的发挥自己的创造性和积极性。因此，在工人群众中有组织有计划地推广“速成识字法”，便成了我们当前工人文化教育工作中的迫切任务。
    二、“速成识字法”的教学过程，大致可以分为三个步骤：第一步学会注音符号和拼音，掌握这种识字的辅助工具；第二步，突击生字，先求会读和初步会讲；第三步，学习语文课本，展开阅读、写字、写话活动，巩固已经认识的文字并求进一步的提高。这是“速成识字法”的基本方法，在各地普遍推行中，必须根据工人的具体情况，继续努力研究，发展和充实这种识字方法。
    三、根据各地已有经验，第一，在组织工人群众采用“速成识字法”进行学习时，首先必须做好思想动员工作，用实际的事例说明“速成识字法”的好处，解除他们的思想顾虑，并进一步从政治上提高他们的学习自觉性、主动性与积极性，以坚定他们的信心。而且这种思想动员工作，还必须在学习过程中，针对学员的思想情况，经常进行。第二，在教学过程中必须按学员的程度编班，以免影响教学进度和学员情绪。在讲课时，必须联系实际，课前备课，可让一些学员参加，以便及时解决教学中的问题，满足学员们的要求。这就要求教员要高度地发挥自己的领导作用与学员的自觉性，正确掌握教学进度，抓紧教学时间。第三，必须注意巩固学员的学习成绩。巩固的方法，主要是在突击生字后大量阅读通俗读物。因此，在学员毕业前，除供给其大量通俗书报外，并应教会学员使用字典，布置复习作业，发动互相通信，给墙报写稿等，以求不断提高。
    四、根据事实和经验，我们可以肯定在全国各地职工业余学校中普遍推行“速成识字法”是刻不容缓的事情了。但是我们的经验还不具体，还不系统，因此，在普遍推行“速成识字法”之前，首先必须有个广泛实验的期间，以便取得普遍推行的经验，为此规定：
    第一、为了有效地在工人中推行“速成识字法”，各级工会文教部干部，必须首先学会注音符号和拼音，并应研究“速成识字法”的基本方法和已有经验。
    第二、各大行政区直属市、各省属市及各产业工会文教部应指定专人负责，必须在五、六、七、八四个月中，与当地政府教育部门合作，在党的领导下，制定具体计划，做好准备工作，取得行政和青年团的配合，至少组织一个“速成识字法”实验班（人数视具体情况而定），以取得实际经验。
    第三、在实验期间，并应集中十个到二十个当地的职工业余学校教员参加实验，以打下普遍训练教员的基础。
    第四、在实验期间，要利用工会报纸和地方报纸以及其它宣传武器，进行推广“速成识字法”的广泛宣传，并应及时介绍实验经验。
    第五、在实验期间，各地应经常总结经验，逐级上报。各大行政区和各省工会文教部，并应指定专人，经常组织和检查这一工作进行的程度。
    第六、八月份各地进行实验总结，并制定普遍推行“速成识字法”的计划，报告全国总工会文教部，以便制定全国推行计划。
    五、“速成识字法”的推行，对我们的职工业余教育将有极其重大的意义和作用；而在教育方法上，也将引出更多经验，希各地工会接此通知后，结合当地具体情况，迅速进行实验。
                              五月六日
