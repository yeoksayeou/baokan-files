    North China Materials Exchange Conference Achieves Transactions of Over 530 Billion Yuan
    Native Produce Company and Cooperatives Sign Purchase Contracts for Planned Acquisition of Native Produce
    Since the North China Materials Exchange Conference began its large-scale trading activities in early May, it has, as of the 14th, achieved transactions totaling over 530 billion yuan. Large quantities of local and specialty products have found markets, and many units have purchased industrial raw materials such as tobacco leaves and hemp. Private sectors in Tianjin, such as the Chinese medicine industry and general merchandise businesses, have actively participated in the conference's transactions, with brisk buying and selling.
    A key feature of the transactions during this stage is the planned and organized acquisition of native produce through purchase contracts. The North China Company of the China Native Produce Company and its affiliated provincial native produce companies have signed purchase contracts with the North China Five Provinces Cooperative Federation for seven major North China native products, including white hemp, sunflower seeds, black dates, walnuts, peach kernels, sweet apricots, and bitter apricots, totaling over 170 billion yuan. According to the contracts, the provincial cooperative federations will deliver the purchased items to the respective provincial native produce companies as they are acquired, based on the different seasons of the native products. The companies will then allocate purchase funds on schedule and pay the cooperatives a purchasing fee ranging from 2.5% to 4%. The signing of such purchase contracts not only overcomes the blindness in the production and sales of North China's native produce, guaranteeing the sales of native products, but also plays a significant role in strengthening the leadership of the state-owned economy and ensuring the completion of export goods procurement tasks.
    To further organize and expand future material exchanges, the exchange conference is currently holding specialized meetings on industrial raw materials, agricultural implements, and cotton knitwear, among others, to conduct organized transactions.

    华北区物资交流大会成交五千三百多亿元
    土产公司与合作社签订代购合同有计划地收购土产
    华北区物资交流大会自五月上旬展开大规模交易活动以来，截至十四日止，已共成交五千三百多亿元，大量土产特产找到销路，不少单位购进了烟叶、麻等工业原料。天津市国药业、杂货商业等私营行业都积极参加大会交易，购销颇为活跃。
    通过代购合同有计划有组织地收购土产，是这一阶段成交中的特点之一。中国土产公司华北区公司及所属各省土产公司与华北五省合作总社签订了白麻、葵花子、乌枣、核桃、桃仁、甜杏、苦杏等七种华北区主要土产的代购合同，总值一千七百多亿元。根据合同，各省合作总社将根据不同的土产季节，随购随交各省土产公司，由各公司按期拨付收购资金，并付给合作社以百分之二点五至百分之四不等的代购手续费。签订这种代购合同，不仅可以克服华北土产产销中的盲目性，保证了土产的销路，同时在加强国营经济的领导，保证出口物资收购任务的完成上，也将起重大作用。
    交流大会为进一步组织与扩大今后物资交流，现正分别召开工业原料、农具、棉毛针织品等专业会议，进行有组织的成交。
