The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation issued statements and jointly issued written statements, angrily condemning the U.S. aggressors' heinous crime of deliberately conducting large-scale germ warfare.

The statement of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation said: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing all Chinese women, expresses great anger at the crimes of the U.S. military in Korea for conducting germ warfare as confessed by the two captured U.S. airmen. Chinese women will join the entire Chinese people in responding to the inhumane germ warfare conducted by the U.S. aggressors with practical actions, and resolutely fight to defend the security of the motherland and world peace.

The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a written statement saying: Following the "Investigation Team on Crimes of U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare" and the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers presenting a large number of evidences of U.S. aggressors conducting germ warfare, now, two American prisoners of war who personally dropped germ bombs have once again irrefutably provided evidence of U.S. aggressors deliberately and on a large scale using bacteriological weapons. All attempts by the U.S. aggressors to deceive the people of the world have completely failed. Chinese youth absolutely cannot tolerate the crimes of the U.S. aggressors, and we will, together with the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world, take practical actions to smash the germ warfare of the U.S. aggressors. We firmly believe that the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors will be justly judged by the people of the world.

    谴责美国侵略者蓄意大规模进行细菌战
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会等四团体分别发表声明和联合发表书面谈话，愤怒谴责美国侵略者有计划地大规模地进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会的声明说：对于被俘获的两名美国空军人员所供出侵朝美军进行细菌战的罪行，中华全国民主妇女联合会代表全中国妇女表示极大的愤怒。中国妇女将和全中国人民一起，用实际的行动来回答美国侵略者所进行的灭绝人性的细菌战，并为保卫祖国的安全和全世界的和平而坚决奋斗。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会联合发表书面谈话说：继“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”和国际民主法律工作者协会调查团提出美国侵略者进行细菌战的大量的罪证后，现在，亲身投掷过细菌弹的两名美国战俘再一次无可争辩地提供了美国侵略者有计划地大规模地使用细菌武器的罪状。美国侵略者一切企图蒙蔽全世界人民视听的狡赖手段完全破产了。中国青年对于美国侵略者的罪行是绝对不能容忍的，我们将和全国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民一道，以实际行动来粉碎美国侵略者的细菌战。我们深信：美国侵略者的暴行，必将受到全世界人民的正义裁判。
