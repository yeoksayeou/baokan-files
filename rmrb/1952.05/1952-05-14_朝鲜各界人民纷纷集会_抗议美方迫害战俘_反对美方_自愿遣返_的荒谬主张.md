Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th—People from all walks of life in Korea unanimously protested against the U.S. aggressors' shameless act of attempting to detain a large number of our captured personnel. Workers at a factory held a protest meeting on the 11th, unanimously and resolutely expressing their opposition to the U.S.'s absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation," which is essentially the detention of most of our captured personnel. Model worker Jin Bingde angrily said: "The U.S. aggressors insist on detaining our captured personnel in order to hand them over to the Li Chengwan and Jiang Jieshi bandits to be used as cannon fodder. But even if it uses all kinds of threats and intimidation, and persecutes our captured personnel in every possible way, its sinister purpose will absolutely not be achieved."

Tian Yuanjun, a model farmer from Dingping Village in Pyongyang, protested, saying: The continuous anti-persecution movements launched by our captured personnel in the U.S. POW camp on Geoje Island have further exposed the ferocious face of the U.S. beasts who massacre prisoners of war. On May 7, our captured personnel's indignant detention of Dodds, the person in charge of the U.S. POW camp, was a just resistance against persecution and massacre. In order to rescue our captured personnel groaning under the iron hooves of the U.S. beasts, we will resolutely fight for the complete release and repatriation of prisoners of war.

Protesters unanimously called on all kind and upright people to take action and completely smash the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to kill and detain prisoners of war in order to delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations.

    朝鲜各界人民纷纷集会
    抗议美方迫害战俘
    反对美方“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张
    【新华社平壤十三日电】朝鲜各界人民一致抗议美国侵略者妄图扣留我方大批被俘人员的无耻行为。某工厂工人在十一日举行了抗议大会，一致坚决表示反对美方的实质上就是扣留我方大部分被俘人员的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。模范工人金炳德愤怒地说：“美国侵略者坚持扣留我方被俘人员，就是想把他们交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。但是即使它使用了一切威胁恫吓手段，百般迫害我方被俘人员，它的罪恶目的也是绝对不会达到的。”
    平壤市定平里的模范农民田元均抗议说：在巨济岛美方战俘营内的我方被俘人员连续展开的反迫害运动，已进一步揭穿了美国野兽残杀战俘的凶恶面貌。五月七日我方被俘人员愤然扣留美方战俘营负责人杜德的行动，是他们反迫害反屠杀的正义反抗。为了解救呻吟在美国野兽铁蹄下的我方被俘人员，我们将坚决为实现全部释放与遣返战俘而斗争。
    抗议者一致号召所有善良正直的人们行动起来，彻底粉碎美国侵略者残杀扣留战俘以拖延甚至破坏停战谈判的阴谋。
