Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo (delayed): The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a letter to the Japanese people on March 25th regarding the US Senate's approval of the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty." The following is a summary:

On March 23rd, the US Senate passed the "Peace Treaty" with Japan and the "Security Treaty." This event signifies that the American ruling class disregards the American people's desire for peace and their commitment to international good faith. It does not desire world peace but desires war, and does not desire international cooperation but hopes to undermine international cooperation.

Ridgway said on March 21st: "The Treaty of Peace with Japan and the Security Treaty were drafted for the independence of Japan and to defend Japan from aggression by the Soviet Union and communist forces. Therefore, the United States will station troops in Japan." However, the reality is not so. These two treaties are not for the independence of Japan, but for the United States, for America's war policy, especially for launching wars against China and the Soviet Union. This was clearly shown in the discussion and resolution of the US Senate this time.

From any point of view, these two treaties and the "Administrative Agreement" are beneficial to the United States and detrimental to Japan. For the Japanese people, the consequence of recognizing these treaties can only be occupation, being treated as beasts of burden, and having bayonets thrust at their throats. In short, as a result of the treaties coming into effect, Japan will only be a puppet of the US imperialists. The US imperialists have bought off Japan's reactionary forces, giving "independence in name only," and in fact completed a treaty of permanent occupation.

It goes without saying that the ambitions and actions of the US imperialists in the Far East will become more blatant and active in the future. The rule, oppression, and exploitation of the Japanese people will also intensify day by day. After the treaties come into effect, through the traitorous government and its lackeys, it will more cleverly press these things upon the heads and shoulders of the Japanese people.

Confiscation of land, business closures, enterprise "rationalization," intensified labor, layoffs, unemployment, hunger, and all sorts of hardships are being imposed on the heads of the people. These phenomena are increasing and expanding, and that is the result of approving these two treaties.

We, along with the majority of the people, do not recognize any treaties or agreements recognized by this traitorous government and traitorous Diet, which are occupied and have bayonets pointed at their backs.

We are willing to exert all our strength, mobilize the strength of all patriots, and unite the strength of the people of the whole country, to strive to abolish these humiliating treaties and agreements.

All the policies required by the two treaties and the administrative agreement, as well as the laws enacted to support the domestic reactionary forces by taking advantage of the situation, will meet with greater blows from the masses of the people. The people will further strengthen their resistance. The movement to refuse to hand over land, houses, fishing grounds, harbors, wharves, and all equipment, and to demand that these things be returned to their original owners, will also become increasingly fierce. This movement will develop into not buying any American goods, not selling anything to the American troops, not accepting military orders, and not accepting employment by the American military. The struggle for peace and independence will permeate all of Japan. Our party will always stand at the forefront and fight alongside the masses.

    日共斥责美国参议院批准对日“和约”
    号召日本爱国者团结斗争废除卖国条约
    【新华社讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党中央指导部于三月二十五日就美国参议院批准单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”发表告日本全国人民书，摘要如下：
    三月二十三日美国参议院通过了对日“和约”和“安全条约”。这件事意味着美国统治阶级忽视美国人民愿意和平与履行国际信义的意志，它不愿世界和平而愿意战争，不愿国际合作而希望破坏国际间的合作。
    李奇微在三月二十一日说：“对日和约与安全条约是为了日本的独立、保卫日本不受苏联及共产主义势力的侵略而拟制的。所以美国将在日本驻军。”但是，事实上并不是如此。这两个条约不是为了日本的独立，而是为了美国，为了美国的战争政策，特别是为了发动对中苏两国的战争。在这次美国参议院的讨论和决议中，明确地显示了这一点。
    不论从那一个角度来看，这两个条约和“行政协定”都是对美国有利，对日本不利的。对于日本国民说来，承认这些条约的结果只能是被占领、被作为牛马、被枪刺刺在喉头。总之，条约生效的结果，日本只不过是美帝国主义者的傀儡而已。美帝国主义者收买日本的反动势力，给予“名义上的独立”，在事实上完成了永久占领的条约。
    美帝国主义者在远东的野心和行动今后将更加露骨而且积极起来，是用不着多说的。对日本国民的统治、压迫和剥削也将日益加强。条约生效以后，通过卖国政府及其走狗们，它将更巧妙地把这些东西压在日本人民的头上和肩上。
    征收土地、企业倒闭、企业“合理化”、加强劳动、裁减人员、失业、饥饿等，所有这些各种各样的苦恼，都压在国民的头上。这些现象与日俱增地在扩大，这就是批准这两个条约的结果。
    我们和大多数国民一道，不承认这个被占领、被枪刺指在背心的卖国政府和卖国国会所承认的任何条约与协定。
    我们愿竭尽我们所有的力量，动员一切爱国者的力量，团结全国人民的力量，努力废除这些屈辱的条约和协定。
    两个条约和行政协定所要求的一切政策，以及乘机制订的支持国内反动势力的法律，将遇到国民群众更大的打击。国民将更加加强抵抗的力量。拒绝缴出土地、房屋、渔场、港湾、码头和一切设备，并且要求把这些东西归还给原主的运动，也将日益炽烈起来。这运动将发展成不购买一切美国商品，不卖东西给美国驻军，不接受军事订货，不应美军的雇佣。和平与独立的斗争将弥漫全日本。我党将永远站在前列，和群众一起进行斗争。
