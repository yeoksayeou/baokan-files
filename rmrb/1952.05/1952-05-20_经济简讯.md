Economic Briefs

    ▲ In order to help private industrial and commercial enterprises overcome production difficulties during the off-season, state-owned economic departments in the Central-South region have, since March, been entrusting processing, placing orders, and purchasing stockpiled products from private factories and merchants that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, based on market supply and demand. The total value of processing, orders, and purchases entrusted by the China Department Store Central-South Company in April increased more than threefold compared to March, benefiting more than 3,500 manufacturers. The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Central-South Company also increased its plan to entrust small weaving factories with processing by 20%.
    Because these private manufacturers eliminated the "five evils" in the "Five-Anti" campaign, and the workers actively united with the capitalists to improve production and operation, the quality of processed products has improved, costs have decreased, and raw materials have been saved. For example, the amount of 20-count yarn raw cotton used per piece has been reduced from 414 jin before the "Five-Anti" campaign to 395 jin. The cost of dyeing cloth has also been reduced by 10%. In terms of grain processing, the rice yield of second-grade rice has increased from 63% to 65%, yielding an additional two jin of rice per hundred jin.
    ▲ Bai Yusheng, a model worker in water conservancy in Ningxia Province, created a new record of digging 29.1 cubic meters of earth per day in this year's spring water conservancy project. The 26-member team he led averaged 19.5 cubic meters of earth dug per person per day. After Bai Yusheng's advanced experience in ditch digging was promoted in the spring water conservancy project throughout Ningxia Province, the work efficiency on various construction sites was generally increased by more than 30%, and many projects were completed ahead of schedule. The spring water conservancy project throughout the province saved 200,000 workdays compared to previous years. Bai Yusheng's ditch digging method has the following characteristics: First, reasonable allocation of manpower and improved labor organization. Second, making preparations in advance and continuously studying and improving operating methods. Third, paying attention to conducting patriotic ideological education for team members on a regular basis, so that the competition between groups and individuals is regularized. Fourth, caring about the lives of team members and closely uniting the masses.
    ▲ Fujian Province is one of the main rosin-producing areas in China. In a certain area of western Fujian alone, there are more than 10 million pine trees available for tapping rosin, producing more than 700,000 dan of cooked rosin annually. At present, farmers in various places have begun tapping pine resin, and the people's government is stepping up its work in purchasing, transporting, and processing. Rosin is a raw material for manufacturing soap, paper, paint, electrical appliances, artificial rubber, and other industries, and can also be used for medicinal purposes. Governments at all levels in Fujian Province attach great importance to the development of rosin production. At the end of last year, they established the state-owned Minxi Rosin Company, built a rosin processing plant equipped with steam engines, and sent cadres to Guangdong to learn the technology and experience of mechanized rosin production.

    ▲中南区国营经济部门为了帮助私营工商业度过淡销季节的生产困难，自三月份起，根据市场的供销情况，有计划地向有利于国计民生的私营厂商委托加工、定货和收购积压的产品。中国百货公司中南区公司四月份委托加工、定货和收购的总值，比三月份又增加了三倍多，得到扶助的厂商达三千五百多家。中国花纱布公司中南区公司委托小型织布厂加工的计划也增加了百分之二十。
    由于这些私营厂商在“五反”运动中肃清了“五毒”，工人们主动地团结资方改善生产经营，因此，加工产品质量提高，成本降低，原料节省。例如：每件二十支纱原棉用量已由“五反”前的四百十四斤降低到三百九十五斤。布匹染色成本也降低了百分之十。粮食加工方面，二机米出米率已由百分之六十三增至百分之六十五，每百斤多出二斤米。
    ▲宁夏省水利劳动模范白玉生在今年水利春修工程中，创造了每天挖土二十九点一公方的新纪录，他领导的小队共二十六人平均每人每天挖土十九点五公方。白玉生的挖渠先进经验在宁夏全省水利春修工程中推广以后，使各个工地上的工作效率普遍提高了百分之三十以上，许多工程得以提前完工，全省水利春修工程较往年节省了二十万个工。白玉生挖渠方法有如下几个特点：第一，合理的调配人力，改进劳动组织。第二，提前做好准备工作，不断研究改善操作方法。第三，注意了经常向队员进行爱国主义思想教育，使组与组、个人与个人之间的竞赛运动经常化。第四，关心队员的生活，密切团结群众。
    ▲福建省是我国松香主要产区之一，仅福建西部某地，可供采割松香的松树就有一千多万株，每年生产熟松香七十万担以上。目前各地农民已开始采割松脂，人民政府正加紧进行收购、运输、加工等工作。松香是制造肥皂、纸、油漆、电器、人造橡胶等工业的原料，还可做药用。福建省各级人民政府都很重视发展松香生产，在去年年底就设立了公营闽西松香公司，并建造了有蒸气机设备的松香加工厂，派干部到广东学习机制松香的技术和经验。
