The Northeast People's Government Ministry of Education and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions recently jointly convened a meeting to promote the "Quick Literacy Method." The meeting decided to systematically and gradually promote the "Qi Jianhua Quick Literacy Method" throughout Northeast China. More than 800 people attended the meeting, including负责人 from the cultural and educational departments of provinces and cities in the Northeast region, as well as cultural and educational cadres from various regions and industrial trade unions. Lin Handa, Director of the Workers' and Peasants' Spare-time Education Department of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education, Deputy Director Jiang Ling, and Qi Jianhua, the creator of the "Quick Literacy Method," were all invited to attend.

At the meeting, Li Zhuoran, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out that due to the rapid economic construction in the Northeast region in recent years and the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the political awareness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people have been unprecedentedly enhanced. In order to increase production further and master scientific production technology, they generally demand to learn culture. The promotion of the "Qi Jianhua Quick Literacy Method" is precisely in line with the urgent needs of the broad masses of working people in the Northeast. He also pointed out that in promoting the "Quick Literacy Method," it is necessary to first conduct extensive and in-depth publicity to make it a mass movement; secondly, it is necessary to do a good job in preparing thoroughly, especially the training of teachers. In addition, it is necessary to proceed steadily and with emphasis at the beginning, gain experience, and then promote it universally.

The meeting studied the plan and program for promoting the "Quick Literacy Method," and Dong Chuncai, Deputy Minister of the Northeast People's Government Ministry of Education, gave a summary. Dong Chuncai requested that all localities formulate their plans for promoting the "Quick Literacy Method" this year before the end of May; and pointed out several principles that must be observed in promoting the "Quick Literacy Method" and the need to prevent conservative ideas and impatience and other deviations.

During the meeting, Qi Jianhua, the creator of the "Quick Literacy Method," gave a report and taught teaching methods to the cultural and educational cadres present. In his teaching, he criticized the conservative view of the "three-five concept" in past literacy education (that is, teaching only three or five new characters per lesson), and clearly pointed out that it is necessary to focus on the psychology of adults who want to learn quickly, teach phonetic symbols and Pinyin in a quick way, and then "devour" new characters in a blitz, and after learning one or two thousand characters, teach reading and writing. In this way, in as little as one hundred fifty or sixty hours, one can learn to read popular books and newspapers and write short essays of one or two hundred words. Qi Jianhua's report and teaching methods gave great encouragement to the cadres participating in the study. With a fighting and blitz spirit, he enabled the vast majority of the cadres to learn phonetic symbols and quick literacy teaching methods in a day and a half, making a typical demonstration of quick literacy method teacher training.

The Chongqing Municipal People's Government has decided to further carry out the literacy campaign among workers on the basis of the original spare-time education work for workers in the city. Since liberation, Chongqing has established more than 120 spare-time schools for workers in factories and mines, with more than 100,000 workers participating in these schools. The Chongqing Municipal Workers' Spare-time Education Committee has successively trained and equipped more than 450 full-time teachers for spare-time education work in factories and mines as the backbone of spare-time education work for workers; at the same time, it has also hired more than 3,000 volunteer teachers to participate in the work. The Chongqing Municipal Workers' Spare-time Education Committee has adopted this policy of combining full-time teachers as the backbone with volunteer teachers, which has largely solved the problem of the lack of teachers. In order to facilitate the enrollment of the broad masses of workers, spare-time schools have created many methods suitable for the working nature of various types of workers in terms of organizational form, such as creating mobile study groups among porters, and establishing joint spare-time schools in industries such as seafarers, light industry, and machinery, solving the learning problems of scattered workers and workers in small factories. Spare-time schools pay special attention to absorbing worker cadres and activists to enroll. According to a survey by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, more than 80% of worker cadres and activists have participated in spare-time learning. In order to further promote workers' cultural learning, the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions began to promote the "Quick Literacy Method" among the working masses in Chongqing from April 1 this year, with more than 4,400 workers participating in the quick literacy classes.

The Chongqing Municipal People's Government has decided to first conduct a survey and statistics of illiteracy and semi-illiteracy in the grassroots trade unions of various factories and mines, and then formulate specific plans to gradually carry out the literacy campaign for workers according to the specific conditions of each unit, such as funding and teachers.

    东北人民政府教育部  东北总工会联合召开会议
　　决定在东北全区推行“速成识字法”
    重庆市在厂矿企业中进一步开展职工识字运动
    东北人民政府教育部和东北总工会最近联合召开了推行“速成识字法”会议。会议决定在东北全区有计划地逐步推行“祁建华速成识字法”。参加这次会议的有东北区各省市文化教育部门负责人和各地区、各产业工会的文教干部等八百余人，中央人民政府教育部工农业余教育司司长林汉达、副司长江凌和“速成识字法”的创造者祁建华都应邀出席。
    会上，东北人民政府文化教育委员会主任李卓然指出：由于东北地区数年来经济建设的迅速发展，和“三反”“五反”运动获得伟大胜利，广大劳动人民的政治觉悟和生产积极性空前提高，他们为了更多地增加生产，进一步掌握科学的生产技术，普遍要求学习文化。“祁建华速成识字法”的推广，正适合东北广大劳动人民的迫切要求。他并指出：在推行“速成识字法”时，必须首先进行广泛深入的宣传，使之成为群众性的运动；其次必须做好充分的准备工作，特别是教员的训练。此外，在开始时要稳步地有重点地进行，取得经验，然后普遍推广。
    会议研究了推行“速成识字法”的计划和方案，并由东北人民政府教育部副部长董纯才作总结。董纯才要求各地在五月底以前订出今年推行“速成识字法”的计划；并指出了推行“速成识字法”必须遵守的几项原则和必须防止保守思想和急性病等偏向。
    在会议期间，“速成识字法”创造者祁建华作了报告，并向到会的文教干部传授教学方法。他在教学时，批判了过去识字教育中“三五观念”的保守观点（即每课只教三、五个生字），明确地指出：要针对成年人要求速成的心理，以速成方式教会注音符号和拼音，然后就要“狼吞虎咽”地突击认生字，识字一两千字以后，再教以阅读和写作。这样，只要一百五、六十小时，就可以学会阅读通俗书报，写作一、二百字的短文。祁建华的报告和传授教学法，给予参加学习的干部以极大鼓舞。他以一种战斗的突击精神，在一天半的时间内，使绝大多数的干部学会了注音符号和速成识字教学法，作了一次速成识字法师资训练的典型示范。

    重庆市人民政府决定在该市原有职工业余教育工作的基础上，进一步开展职工识字运动。重庆市自解放以来，在厂矿企业中已建立了职工业余学校一百二十多所，有十万多职工参加这些学校学习。重庆市职工业余教育委员会已先后给各厂矿企业训练和配备了专任职工业余教育工作的教员四百五十多人，作为职工业余教育工作中的骨干；同时还聘请了三千多义务教员参加工作。重庆市职工业余教育委员会采取这种以专任教员为骨干与义务教员相结合的方针，大体上解决了教师缺乏的问题。为便于广大职工入学，业余学校在组织形式上，创造了许多适合于各类工人工作性质的方法，如在搬运工人中创造了流动学习组，在海员、轻工业、机器业等行业中建立了联合业余学校，解决了分散的工人与小厂工人的学习问题。业余学校特别注意吸收工人干部和积极分子入学，据市总工会的调查，已有百分之八十以上的工人干部和积极分子参加了业余学习。为了进一步推动职工的文化学习，重庆市总工会从今年四月一日开始在重庆工人群众中推广“速成识字法”，参加速成识字班学习的工人有四千四百多人。
    重庆市人民政府已决定首先在各厂矿企业的基层工会中进行文盲、半文盲的调查统计工作，然后根据各单位的经费、师资等具体情况制订逐步开展职工识字运动的具体计划。　（新华社）
