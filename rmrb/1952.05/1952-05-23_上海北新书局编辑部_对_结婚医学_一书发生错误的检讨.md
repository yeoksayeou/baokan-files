Response to readers' criticisms and suggestions in People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    The letter from comrades Yuan Ruifang and Li Junmin published in the People's Daily on April 16th, criticizing the book "Marriage Medicine," compiled by Mou Hongyi and published by our bookstore, correctly pointed out the error of blindly promoting the reactionary idealist Mendelian-Morgan theory. The criticism of comrades Yuan and Li is entirely correct. Our bookstore is conducting a comprehensive review of previously published books to improve the quality of publications. We have decided to stop selling "Marriage Medicine" and have notified all branches accordingly. In the past, we published books with such erroneous content and failed to promptly review and address them, resulting in the dissemination of the negative influence of the reactionary Mendelian-Morgan theory. This demonstrates that our ideological level and sense of responsibility to readers are insufficient. In the future, we will diligently improve the editing and review work of our publications, raise our ideological level, and strengthen our sense of responsibility to readers.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对“结婚医学”一书发生错误的检讨
    编辑同志：四月十六日人民日报所载袁瑞芳、李俊民两同志对牟鸿彝编、本局出版的“结婚医学”一书的批评信中，指出该书有盲目宣扬反动的唯心的孟德尔—莫尔根学说的错误；袁、李两同志的批评是完全正确的。本局为提高出版物水平，正在对以往所出版的书籍进行全面检查。“结婚医学”一书，我们已决定停售，并分别通知各分店办理。以往我们出版了这种内容错误的书籍，又没有及时地检查处理，以致散布了反动的孟德尔—莫尔根学说的恶劣影响，这说明我们的思想水平，以及对读者的责任心是很不够的。今后我们一定认真做好出版物的编审工作，提高思想水平，加强对读者的责任心。
