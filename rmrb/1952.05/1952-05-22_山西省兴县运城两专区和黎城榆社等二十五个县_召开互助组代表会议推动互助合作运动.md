Shanxi Province, Xingxian Special District, Yuncheng Special District, and twenty-five counties including Licheng and Yushe, all convened mutual aid group representative meetings at the special district or county level in March of this year. These meetings have greatly promoted the further development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Shanxi Province.

A total of six thousand representatives attended these mutual aid group representative meetings. They were all leaders and key members of mutual aid groups. The meetings generally lasted three to five days, focusing on resolving three issues:

First, a clear understanding of the policy and future of mutual aid. At the meetings, everyone studied the report by Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, on "The Direction of Rural Economic Development," studied the experiences of various model mutual aid groups, and the leaders of the meetings introduced the situation of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and the happy lives of Soviet farmers. This transformed many representatives' superficial view that organizing was merely for "getting rich" and "overcoming difficulties," and they began to clearly understand the path and prospects of agricultural production development in New China. At the mutual aid group representative meetings in Licheng, Hequ, and other counties, after the representatives earnestly studied and discussed the "voluntary and mutually beneficial" mutual aid policy, they eliminated the "fear of suffering losses," "fear of trouble," and "wanting to work alone" thoughts of many people, and established the concept of long-term agricultural mutual aid for the agricultural collectivization of New China.

Secondly, the representatives were made to clearly understand that learning advanced farming techniques, increasing yield per unit area, combining with supply and marketing cooperatives, and actively developing sideline occupations to solve surplus labor were important keys to consolidating and improving labor mutual aid.

Thirdly, the relatively widespread laissez-faire tendency in the leadership of mutual aid and the errors of coercion and commandism in the work style of certain party members and cadres were strictly examined and criticized. For example, the Yu County representative meeting reflected that until March of this year, the mutual aid movement in one-third of the county's villages was still in a state of laissez-faire. The representatives criticized certain village cadres for empty slogans of "organizing," while not actively participating in leadership themselves, or the formalism tendency of forcibly including every household in the village in a mutual aid group.

The mutual aid group representative meetings in each county formulated resolutions and plans for carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement based on the actual conditions of the county. The resolution of Heshun County stipulated that this year, the county should ensure that the number of male laborers organized reaches 80 percent of the total, and female laborers reach 60 percent; long-term mutual aid groups should reach 70 percent of the total number of mutual aid groups. The county should also cultivate two hundred high-yield groups.

In areas where such representative meetings have been held, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has seen new development. After Gao Ping County held a mutual aid group representative meeting, district and village cadres assisted the mutual aid group representatives in mobilizing farmers who had not yet participated in mutual aid to organize, while also reorganizing the original mutual aid organizations. Within one month, the county not only rectified 70 percent of the mutual aid groups, but also developed 1,500 new mutual aid groups. Hundreds of mutual aid groups throughout the county have signed combination contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. After Qu Yaoli, a national cotton high-yield model, participated in the mutual aid group representative meeting, he promoted the establishment of 31 mutual aid groups in Quzhuangtou Village, and all of them formulated production increase plans.

Holding mutual aid group representative meetings is an effective way to develop, consolidate, and improve mutual aid groups. This method is now being widely promoted throughout Shanxi Province. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西省兴县运城两专区和黎城榆社等二十五个县
    召开互助组代表会议推动互助合作运动
    山西省兴县专区、运城专区和黎城、榆社等二十五县，今年三月间都召开了全专区或全县的互助组代表会议。这些会议，对山西省进一步开展互助合作运动起了很大的推动作用。
    参加这些互助组代表会议的代表计有六千人。他们都是互助组的组长和骨干分子。开会的时间一般是三天到五天，会上着重地解决了三个问题：
    第一、明确认识了互助的政策和前途；会上，大家学习了东北人民政府主席高岗“关于农村经济发展的方向问题”的报告；研究了各模范互助组的经验；领导会议的负责人介绍了先进的农业生产合作社的情况和苏联农民的幸福生活。这样使许多代表们转变了对组织起来只是为了“发家致富”、“克服困难”的肤浅看法，开始明确地认识了新中国农业生产发展的道路和远景。黎城、河曲等县互助组代表会议上，代表们在认真地学习讨论了“自愿两利”的互助政策后，便消除了许多人“怕吃亏”、“怕麻烦”、“想单干”等思想，树立了长期农业互助为新中国的农业集体化而奋斗的观念。
    其次，使各地代表明确地认识了：学习先进耕作技术，提高单位面积产量，与供销合作社相结合，积极发展副业解决剩余劳力，是巩固和提高劳动互助的重要关键。
    第三，严格地检查和批判了互助领导上较普遍存在的放任自流偏向和某些党员干部作风上强迫命令的错误。如盂县代表会议反映，直到今年三月，全县三分之一的村庄互助运动仍陷于自流状态。代表们批评了某些村干部空喊叫“组织起来”，自己却不积极参加领导，或强把全村每户编入互助组的形式主义偏向。
    各县的互助组代表会议，都根据本县的实际情况，订出开展互助合作运动的决议和计划。和顺县的决议中规定，今年全县要使组织起来的男劳动力达到总数的百分之八十，女劳动力达到百分之六十；长年互助组要达到互助组总数的百分之七十。全县还要培养二百个丰产组。
    凡已召开过这种代表会议的地区，互助合作运动就有新的发展。高平县在召开互助组代表会议后，区村干部协助互助组代表，一面发动还没有参加互助的农民组织起来，一面整理原有的互助组织。全县在一个月内除整顿了百分之七十互助组外，并发展了新互助组一千五百个。全县已有数百个互助组和供销合作社订了结合合同。全国棉花丰产模范曲耀离参加互助组代表会议后，推动曲庄头村建立了三十一个互助组，并都订出增产计划。
    召开互助组代表会议，是发展、整理和提高互助组的有效的办法。现在山西全省正普遍推广此一方法。  （新华社）
