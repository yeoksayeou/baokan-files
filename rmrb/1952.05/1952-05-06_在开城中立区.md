    In the Kaesong Neutral Zone
    Ba Jin
    I stood before the tomb of "Martyr Yao Qingxiang, who sacrificed for the peace of Korea," looking down at the Nam Mountain. Amidst the deep green pine trees, the blooming pink peach blossoms were revealed. Beside a shallow pool of water were several budding willows, and several patches of newly green wheat fields. Two or three Korean women in white clothes walked out of the village at the foot of the opposite mountain. I gazed at this peaceful scene for a long time. This rain-washed field reminded me of the spring in my homeland of Jiangnan. Although a flurry of snow had passed this morning, spring had indeed arrived in Kaesong, on the 38th parallel of Korea. Even if it came late, it had finally arrived. Yesterday, I saw nearly two hundred elementary school students with happy smiles on their faces in the schoolyard, and heard their youthful songs. In this very schoolyard, I also saw the Korean flowers blooming beautifully.
    Korea is a land of flowers. When spring arrives, the mountains and fields are covered with brightly colored blossoms. But the American aggressors have exhausted every means to turn this beautiful land into a wasteland. For more than a month, I have passed through many Korean cities, and I have not seen a single neat and intact house. But this place is an exception. Here, before my eyes, a peaceful village appeared, and on the other side, in the place I had just come from, there were also beautiful houses with typical Korean flavor.
    This is a special place. Kaesong is the neutral zone in the Korean War. The Korean armistice talks began here, and the current conference site, Panmunjom, is also nearby. During the day, walking out of the city, I could see four silver balloons suspended in the air above Panmunjom. At night, standing on the veranda of my residence, I saw a cylindrical searchlight beam rising straight into the sky. Here, one rarely hears the sound of airplanes. American planes occasionally pass over the city, but quickly pass on. This is indeed a special place.
    Martyr Yao Qingxiang's tombstone faces the peaceful scene below the mountain. On the back of this tombstone, I read the following passage: "...After the start of the Korean armistice talks, Comrade Yao Qingxiang was ordered to go to the Kaesong neutral zone to serve as a military policeman, protecting the conference site and the safety of both delegations. On August 19, 1951, while patrolling near Panmunjom, he was illegally attacked by armed forces of the American-Li aggressor troops who had been ambushing there, and heroically sacrificed his life." This passage of the inscription illustrates the insincere attitude taken by the American aggressors in the Korean armistice talks. Martyr Yao Qingxiang sacrificed himself in the neutral zone, sacrificing himself while performing a solemn duty. His remains still lie here, protecting peace. Ten months will soon pass. The negotiating venue was moved from Laifeng Village in Kaesong to Panmunjom. The eyes of the people of the world are focused on the few tents in Panmunjom, hoping that the aggressors can learn from their failures, accept the fair and reasonable peace terms of the Chinese and Korean people, and stop the aggression and atrocities against the Korean people. But today, the American aggressors continue to delay the negotiations with meetings lasting one minute, half a minute, forty seconds. And even in the middle of the negotiations, they are throwing a large number of insects carrying various bacteria and viruses on Korean land outside this neutral zone, and have begun a bacteriological war aimed at slaughtering the Korean people. Not only that, even the land of this neutral zone has suffered damage from American bombs, and even Laifeng Village, which served as the negotiating venue, still bears the scars caused by American bombs today. Martyr Yao Qingxiang's blood was not shed in vain. Today he sleeps on this hillside, as if he is still watching with his eyes open the enemies who are destroying peace, and he is constantly warning us to be vigilant.
    I walked down the mountain and turned to the road on the left, and saw a large burned-down building. I walked through the central area of the city, and everywhere there were piles of rubble. In the city, I couldn't easily find an intact house. I have been to this area more than once. The peaceful scene I saw earlier is only one side of the neutral zone. The other side is these countless broken tiles and crumbling walls that tell people about the atrocities of American imperialism. The Korean people live in these piles of rubble. At noon, the market still presents an unprecedentedly crowded and lively scene. Now people are all sitting at home resting.
    I also returned to my temporary "home." As soon as I sat down on the kang (platform bed), I heard a roaring cannon sound. This sound is not unfamiliar to me. Every night, every morning I hear it. American artillery is firing at our positions again. This constant artillery fire, morning and evening, makes me forever remember one fact: our soldiers are not only on guard at all times, but they are also protecting the peace here. They are protecting this neutral zone where war is lurking everywhere. We all know that the American imperialists wanted this city at the beginning of the negotiations. But they did not have the strength to take Kaesong, so they had to fire randomly at our positions outside this neutral zone. And our soldiers, their courage and confidence, as well as their spirit of optimism, have moved and inspired everyone who has been to the front lines. They are all heroes like Martyr Yao Qingxiang. They are determined to defend world peace, repel the invaders, and make international contributions. With them, there is this special peaceful scene here, and with them, there will definitely be the final, true peace. Because peace is not obtained by waiting, peace is won by the power of the people.

    在开城中立区
    巴金
    我站在“为朝鲜和平而牺牲的姚庆祥烈士”的墓前，望子南山下。在深绿的松树中间露出盛开的粉红桃花，一汪浅水旁边有几棵抽芽的杨柳，有几块新绿的麦田，对面山脚下村子里走出来两三个穿白衣的朝鲜女人。我把眼前这一片和平的景象望了好一会。这雨后的田野使我想到了祖国的江南的春天。虽然今天早晨还飘过一阵雪，可是在朝鲜三八线上的开城，春天毕竟来了，即使它来得迟，但它终于来了。昨天我还在小学校的操场上看见将近两百个小学生的快乐的笑容，听到他们年青的歌声。就在这个操场上我也看到开得很好的朝鲜的花。
    朝鲜是花的国土，春天到来的时候，满山满野开遍了颜色鲜明的花。可是美国侵略者却用尽方法把这个美丽的国土变成一片废墟。一个多月来，我经过不少的朝鲜的城市，我就没有看见一间整齐完好的屋子。这里却是一个例外。在这里，在我眼前出现了和平的村庄，而且在那一边，在我刚才来的那个地方还有着典型的朝鲜风味的美丽的房屋。
    这里是一个特殊的地方。开城是朝鲜战争中的中立区。朝鲜的停战谈判的会议就是在这里开始的，而且现在的谈判会议的会场板门店也就在这附近。白天走出城区，我可以看见悬在板门店上空的四个银色气球。夜晚站在住房的廊上，我又看到那圆柱似的探照灯光笔直地高耸在天空。在这里这时很少听见飞机声，美国飞机偶尔也经过这个城市的上空，但很快地就过了。这里的确是一个特殊的地方。
    姚庆祥烈士的墓碑面对着山下的和平景象。就在这墓碑的背面，我读到这样的一段话：“……朝鲜停战谈判开始后，姚庆祥同志奉命到开城中立区担任军事警察，保卫会场及双方代表团的安全。一九五一年八月十九日在板门店附近巡逻时，遭美李侵略军预伏在该地的武装部队的非法袭击，壮烈殉职。”这一段碑文就说明了美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判中所采取的无诚意的态度。姚庆祥烈士牺牲在中立区内，牺牲在执行庄严的职务的时候，他的遗体还躺在这里保卫和平。十个月很快地就要过去了。谈判的会场由开城的来凤庄搬到板门店。全世界人民的眼光正集中在板门店的几个帐篷上面，希望侵略者能够从失败中得到教训，接受中朝人民的公平合理的和平条件，停止对朝鲜人民的侵略暴行。可是今天美国侵略者还继续在用一分钟、半分钟、四十秒钟的会议来拖延谈判。而且就在谈判进行的中间，他们在这个中立区以外的朝鲜土地上投掷大量的带有各种细菌和病毒的昆虫，开始了以屠杀朝鲜人民为目的的细菌战。不但这样，连这个中立区的土地也曾遭受过美国炸弹的损害，而且连做过谈判会场的来凤庄今天也还留着美国炸弹造成的伤痕。姚庆祥烈士的血并不是白白流了的。今天他睡在这山腰，他好像还睁着两只眼睛在监视着破坏和平的敌人，他时时刻刻都在警告我们，要我们提高警惕。
    我走下山来，向左边的路上转过去，便看见一所烧毁了的大建筑物。我走过城内中心区，到处都是瓦砾堆，在城内我不容易找到一所完好的房屋。这
    一带地方我来过不只一次。先前看见的和平景象不过是中立区的一面，另一面便是这无数的向人们诉说着美帝国主义暴行的断瓦颓垣。朝鲜人民就在这些瓦堆中生活，在正午的时候，市场上还出现了空前拥挤的热闹景象。现在人们都坐在家里休息了。
    我也回到了我的暂时的“家”。刚在炕上坐下来我就听见了轰隆的炮声。这声音对我并不是陌生的。每个夜晚，每个早晨我都听见它。美国的大炮又在向我们的阵地发射。这种早晚不断的炮声使我永远记住一个事实：我们的战士不仅时时刻刻在警戒着，而且他们在保卫着这里的和平。他们在保卫着这个四处埋伏着战争的中立区。我们都知道美帝国主义者在谈判的初期，曾经要过这个城市。可是他们没有力量拿到开城，就只好乱向这个中立区外我方的阵地发炮了。而我们的战士呢，战士们的勇气和信心以及他们的乐观主义的精神使得每个到过前沿阵地的人都受到了感动和鼓舞。他们都是像姚庆祥烈士那样的英雄，他们下了决心要保卫世界和平，打退侵略者，立国际功。有了他们才有这里的特殊的和平景象，而且有了他们也一定会有最后的真正的和平。因为和平不是靠等待得来的，和平是靠人民的力量争取来的。
