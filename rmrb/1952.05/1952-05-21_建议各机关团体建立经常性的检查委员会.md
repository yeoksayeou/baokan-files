    Suggesting the Establishment of Regular Inspection Committees in All Agencies and Organizations
    To the Editor: After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, the frantic attacks of illegal bourgeois elements have been repelled. However, I think illegal bourgeois elements may still use other methods to attack us in the future. Although we have dealt with some embezzlers and thieves, corrected bureaucratic work styles, and criticized the decadent and corrupt bourgeois ideology and work styles in this "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movement, we should still be vigilant against the resurgence of corruption, waste, and bureaucratic work styles. Therefore, I believe that all regions, agencies, and organizations should establish regular inspection committees. This committee should not only supervise and inspect various construction projects to prevent the occurrence of corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and theft of state property, but also regularly study all possible ways to save money, so as to make the increase production and practice economy movement a success. The members of this inspection committee must be the main leading cadres of the respective agencies and organizations, the most steadfast and outstanding cadres, and the model workers recognized by all units. This organization must have the strong leadership of the Party and a mass base. A Reader

    建议各机关团体建立经常性的检查委员会
    编辑同志：经过这次“三反”“五反”运动，已经把不法资产阶级分子的猖狂进攻打退了。但是，我想不法资产阶级分子今后还可能用其他方式来向我们进攻。在这次“三反”“五反”运动中，我们虽然处理了若干贪污盗窃分子，纠正了官僚主义作风，批判了堕落腐化的资产阶级思想作风，但是我们还应该警惕贪污、浪费和官僚主义作风的复活。所以，我认为各地区、各机关、团体，应建立经常性的检查委员会。这一委员会，不只是要监督、检查各种建设工作，防止贪污、浪费、官僚主义和盗窃国家财产事件的发生，并且还要经常研究一切可能的节约办法，以使增产节约运动顺利进行。这一检查委员会的组成人员，必须是各该机关、团体的主要领导干部和立场最坚定的优秀干部和各单位所公认的模范工作人员。这一组织必须有党的坚强领导和群众基础。　一读者
