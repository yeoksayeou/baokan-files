Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Home Delegation, Comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China:

Today, on behalf of the General Association of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and the Beijing Branch, on behalf of the people of Beijing, and on behalf of all the people of China, I extend to you my incomparably warm welcome as you return to the Korean front; at the same time, I express my most heartfelt greetings and sincere thanks to you for your tireless efforts in successfully completing your visits and reporting missions in various regions over the past four months.

Dear Comrades of the Delegation, since you arrived in Beijing on January 18 this year, you have given multiple reports to people from all walks of life in Beijing, and then set off in batches to various parts of the country. Over the past four months, you have traveled to almost every province, city, most of the counties, and hundreds of towns and villages throughout mainland China, except for the Tibet region, and have given more than 5,500 reports of various sizes. The people of China have been deeply moved and influenced by the patriotic and internationalist education you have given, as well as the spirit of hard struggle of the Chinese and Korean people on the Korean battlefield. The speeches of the delegates and the heroic deeds on the Korean battlefield are forever engraved in the hearts of every Chinese person.

During your reporting period, the great revolutionary movements of "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" were launched vigorously in the country. Your reports played a significant role in promoting these movements. Today, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have been successfully completed, and the people of the whole country are launching a larger-scale movement to increase production, practice economy, and promote economic construction on this basis. The people of China must work hard to produce and continue to support you. We must strive to achieve greater victories on two different fronts!

After suffering serious defeats in the war of aggression against Korea and under the righteous pressure of peace-loving people all over the world, the American imperialists had no choice but to engage in peace talks. However, because they are unwilling to admit defeat, they are unreasonably delaying the armistice negotiations on the one hand, and launching heinous bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China in violation of international law on the other hand, and have recently carried out bloody massacres of our prisoners of war on an even larger scale. However, the heroic Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and the people of China and Korea have not been intimidated in the slightest. On the contrary, the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people all over the world are angrily and bravely uniting to resolutely fight to crush the aggressors' bacteriological warfare. Comrades, we all know that we not only have the ability to crush the enemy's bacteriological warfare, but we have the ability to crush any form of war by the enemy.

Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Delegation to China, your visit and reports have obviously further consolidated the fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea. On the basis of the victory of our movement to resist America and aid Korea, we have full confidence in finally stopping the war of aggression launched by the United States and striving for the advent of peace in Korea. Now, as you are about to return to the front, please take back the Chinese people's highest respect for the most beloved people of the motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—and the heroic Korean people, as well as the Chinese people's wholehearted support and determination. I wish you greater victories on the front of defending peace and opposing aggression!

Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!
Long live General Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!
Long live Marshal Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

    张奚若的欢送词
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团的同志们、朝鲜人民访华代表团的同志们：
    今天我代表抗美援朝总会和北京市分会，代表北京市各界人民、代表全中国人民，以无比热烈的心情欢送你们重回朝鲜前方去；同时对你们四个月来不辞辛劳地在各地区胜利完成了访问和传达报告的任务，特表示最亲切的慰问和最诚恳的感谢。
    各位代表同志们，你们自从今年一月十八日来到北京后，即在北京向各界人民进行多次的传达报告，接着又分批向全国各地出发。四个多月以来，你们除了西藏地区以外，几乎走遍了全国大陆每一个省、市、绝大多数的县和几百个乡镇，进行了五千五百多次的大小报告。全中国人民对你们所给予的爱国主义与国际主义相结合的教育，以及中朝人民在朝鲜战场上艰苦奋斗的精神，都受到极大的感动和影响。各位代表们的讲话和朝鲜战场上的英勇事迹是永远刻在每一个中国人的心坎上的。
    在你们传达报告期间，国内正轰轰烈烈地展开了“三反”和“五反”伟大的革命运动。你们的传达报告对这个运动起了很大的推动作用。今天“三反”和“五反”运动已经胜利地完成了，全国人民正在这个基础上展开了更大规模的增产节约和经济建设运动。全中国人民一定要努力生产来继续支援你们。一定要争取在两个不同战线上获得更大的胜利！
    美帝国主义者在侵朝战争遭到严重的失败以后和在全世界爱好和平的人民的正义压力之下，不得不进行和平谈判。但是，他们因为不甘心承认失败，所以一方面无理地拖延停战谈判，另一方面又违反国际公法在朝鲜和中国东北发动了万恶的细菌战争，最近更大规模地对我方俘虏进行血腥屠杀。可是英勇的朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军和中朝两国人民丝毫没有被吓倒，相反的我们中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都在愤怒地、勇敢地团结在一起，为粉碎侵略者的细菌战而坚决斗争。同志们，我们大家知道，我们不但有能力粉碎敌人的细菌战，我们有能力粉碎敌人任何形式的战争。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民访华团各位代表同志们，你们这次的访问和传达报告，显然使中朝两国人民的战斗友谊愈加巩固了。在我们抗美援朝运动胜利的基础上，我们完全有信心最后制止美国发动的侵略战争和争取朝鲜和平的到来。现在，当你们临别重返前线的时候，请你们带回中国人民对祖国最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军，和对英勇的朝鲜人民崇高的敬意和全中国人民全力支援他们的热诚和决心。祝你们在保卫和平、反对侵略的战线上获得更大的胜利！
    中朝人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    朝鲜人民的伟大领袖金日成将军万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
