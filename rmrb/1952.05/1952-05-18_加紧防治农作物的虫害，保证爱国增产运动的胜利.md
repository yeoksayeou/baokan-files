Intensifying the prevention and control of crop pests is an important task to ensure the victory of this year's patriotic production increase movement and to increase yield per unit area. Recently, many regions have launched a resolute struggle against insect pests. For example, farmers in the four special districts of Luoyang and Zhengzhou in Henan Province have used more than 6.4 million person-days to catch insects, killing more than 970,000 jin of wheat aphids and red spiders. In Xinxiang Special District, Pingyuan Province, more than 700,000 people participated in catching insects, completely eliminating pests on more than 1.2 million mu of wheat fields. This year, in Jie County, Shanxi, the number of people organized to go to the fields to kill wheat aphids accounted for two-thirds of the county's population. In Qingcheng County, Western Sichuan, the Nanfu and other eleven townships set up more than 3,000 moth-catching lamps this spring, killing more than 3.6 million rice stem borers in six days. Many cotton-growing areas in Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Henan and other places have begun to prevent and control cotton aphids.

Everyone knows that insect pests are very harmful to crops. The Central People's Government has long instructed all localities to prevent and control insect pests as early as possible this year, and many places have made preparations and arrangements long ago. Now is the most critical season for pest control work, and farmers across the country should put forth all their strength to eliminate pests completely.

"There is no trick to pest control, the first thing is to start early." Everyone should understand this principle. For example, cotton aphids can grow a generation in five or six days in warm weather, and each time they can give birth to dozens of them. If an aphid is treated half a month or twenty days late, it will turn into tens of thousands. Locusts are easier to kill when they are still nymphs, but it is difficult to kill them when they grow up and can fly. In many areas, stem borer egg masses are still on the seedling leaves, and eliminating one egg mass is equivalent to killing dozens to more than a hundred stem borers. Therefore, everyone should be vigilant and always pay attention to inspecting the fields (in locust-affected areas, also pay attention to those remote swamps, reed ponds, etc.). Once pests are found, they should organize forces to catch them and report to higher authorities to eliminate them as soon as possible. Do not be paralyzed and think that "a few bugs are not a big deal and will not cause great harm"; and do not have the fluke mentality that "the bugs will die after a few days of rain or a gust of wind." This kind of wrong thinking is the most harmful. Often, when you go to the fields to see again after a few days, the bugs have become a dark mass, and it will take a lot more effort to eliminate them, and the crops will also suffer losses. Last year, many places started aphid control work a little late, which wasted a lot of manpower. This year, aphid damage may be very serious in many cotton-growing areas. Everyone must learn from last year's lessons and start early.

To achieve early control, we must organize our forces well, give full play to the spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family," and unite to fight. The occurrence and development of pests such as locusts and cotton aphids is precisely during the busiest time of wheat harvesting, and many people will feel that they can't take care of everything. However, if all the manpower in the countryside is organized, and work is divided and cooperated to carry out wheat harvesting and pest control in a planned way, it can be done very well. In the past, farmers in the old liberated areas often spared a large part of their manpower to support the war during the busy farming season, and they could still do a good job in farming; now, if organized well, they will certainly be able to eliminate pests. In cotton-growing areas, everyone must treat aphids at least once before the wheat harvest, and continue to treat them after the wheat harvest; in areas where locust nymphs are found, do not relax locust control work during the wheat harvest, so as not to leave behind hidden dangers.

Pest damage spreads very quickly. If pests are not completely eliminated in one place, they will quickly spread to other places. Today the bugs are still in Zhang's field, and tomorrow they may be in Li's. Therefore, if there are pests in anyone's field, they must find ways to eliminate them quickly, so as not to implicate everyone. If everyone finds pests in the fields of neighboring households or villages, they should enthusiastically help others to eliminate them, just like if there were pests in their own fields. Only in this way can pest damage be quickly eliminated. When wheat aphids were serious in Henan Province this year, the head of the Provincial People's Government personally took action, mobilizing more than 1,000 cadres from the Provincial Government and teachers and students from Henan University to go to the countryside to catch insects. Last year, personnel from government agencies and schools in many places, as well as citizens, housewives, and industrialists and merchants in some cities and towns, voluntarily went to the countryside to help farmers catch insects. This is an act of patriotism and worthy of everyone's learning.

To prevent and control insect pests, we must make a great determination. That is to say, we must fight thoroughly, fight continuously, and never stop until complete victory is achieved. No matter what kind of pest, no matter what good method is used, it cannot be completely eliminated at once. It must be a long-term effort to eliminate it. In the past, when some places were eliminating insects, they were very diligent at first and eliminated almost all the pests, but they did not persist in eliminating them completely. After some time, the pest damage continued to develop, and in the end, it took a lot of effort to fight again, wasting a lot of manpower. Some people also lack confidence in pest control work, and when they see a large area of bugs, they think that they cannot be eliminated; some even superstitiously believe that "bugs are born by nature and the more you fight, the more there will be," which is wrong. As long as everyone works hard to prevent and control them, pests can be eliminated. Last year, more than 100 million mu of crops across the country suffered from insect pests, but through the efforts of the masses, most areas did not suffer disasters. This year, we have more experience in pest control than last year, and we are also more prepared than last year. As long as everyone starts early and persists in the struggle, victory is more assured.

In the work of preventing and controlling insect pests, everyone should learn the common sense of preventing and controlling insect pests (you can refer to the "Summary of Prevention and Control Methods for Several Major Diseases and Insect Pests of Crops in 1952" issued by the Central Ministry of Agriculture, which was published in the People's Daily on April 24, and various small booklets on preventing and controlling insect pests compiled and printed in various places), find out the laws of the occurrence and growth of pests, and find out the tricks to prevent and control insect pests. At the same time, we should pay attention to exchanging experiences and spreading various good methods of preventing and controlling insect pests created by the masses. If you can purchase pesticides and sprayers, of course, you should try your best to use pesticides and machinery to control insects. But without pesticides and machinery, various native methods can also eliminate pests. The wisdom of Chinese farmers is infinite. As long as everyone uses their brains, they can come up with good ideas. For example, farmers in Xin'an County, Henan Province, recently created fifteen methods such as mat pulling and winnowing basket pushing, killing 200,000 jin of wheat aphids. Zhi Guangqing in Yanshi County, Luoyang Special District, Henan, created a very simple "four-legged insect catcher" this year, which can kill wheat sucking worms on 20 mu of land per person per day. His creation was rewarded by the Yanshi County People's Government. The Luoyang Special Commissioner's Office also issued a circular to promote this insect-catching tool throughout the district. We should all learn from these good experiences and methods in insect control, and carry out competitions between counties, districts, villages, groups, households, and people, to kill pests, and ensure the victorious completion of this year's patriotic production increase task.

### 加紧防治农作物的虫害，保证爱国增产运动的胜利

    加紧防治农作物的虫害，保证爱国增产运动的胜利
    防治虫害是保证今年爱国丰产运动的胜利、提高单位面积产量的重要工作之一。最近，许多地区已经和虫害展开了坚决的斗争。例如河南省洛阳、郑州等四个专区的农民，已经用了六百四十多万个人工去捕虫，捕杀了麦蚜虫、红蜘蛛等九十七万多斤。平原省新乡专区有七十多万人参加捕虫，彻底消灭了一百二十多万亩麦田的害虫。山西解县今年组织下地灭麦蚜的人数，占全县人口的三分之二。川西区青神县的南附等十一个乡，今春设置了三千多盏捕蛾灯，六天就捕杀了稻田的螟蛾三百六十多万个。河北、山西、平原、河南等地不少植棉区，已开始防治棉蚜虫。
    大家都知道，害虫蹧害庄稼很厉害。中央人民政府早就指示各地，今年要及早防治虫害，很多地方也早就做了准备和布置。现在正是除虫工作最关紧要的季节，全国各地农民都应该拿出全副力量，把害虫除得干干净净。
    “除虫没有巧，第一是动手早”。这个道理，大家都应该明白。比如，棉蚜虫在暖和的天气里，五、六天就能生长一代，每次能生好几十个。一个蚜虫迟上半月二十天去治，就变成万数个了。蝗虫还是蝻子的时候容易打，等到它长大会飞了，打起来就困难。螟虫的卵块，很多地区现在还在秧叶子上，消灭一个卵块，就等于杀了几十条到一百多条螟虫。因此，大家要提高警惕，时刻注意到田地里检查（在蝗害区，还要注意那些荒僻的沼泽地、苇塘地等），发现了害虫就一面组织力量捕  ，一面向上级报告，趁早把它消灭。千万不要麻痹大意，以为“少数几个虫子没大关系，成不了大害”；更不要抱着侥幸心理，以为“过几天下场雨，刮阵风，虫子就会死掉的”。这种错误思想是最有害的，往往过几天你再到田地里去看，虫子已经变得黑压压一大片，除治起来要多花很多力量，庄稼也要受损失。去年，许多地方治蚜工作动手晚了一点，浪费人力很大。今年，许多植棉区的蚜害可能很严重，大家一定要接受去年的教训，一定要早动手。
    要做到早打，就得好好组织自己的力量，发挥“天下农民是一家”的精神，大家联合起来打。蝗虫、棉蚜等害虫的发生和发展，正是在麦收最紧张的时候，许多人会感到顾了这顾不了那。但是，如果把乡村的全部人力组织起来，分工合作，有计划地进行收麦和治虫，那就可以做得很好。从前，老解放区的农民往往在农忙时抽出很大一部分人去支援战争，还能把耕作搞好；现在如果组织得好，一定也能把害虫打光。在植棉区，大家在麦收前一定要把蚜虫至少治一次，麦收后再继续治；在发现蝗蝻的地区，麦收中也不要放松了治蝗工作，以免留下祸害。
    虫害蔓延得很快。一处的害虫不除尽，很快就会蔓延到别处。今天虫子还在张家地里，明天也许就到了李家。所以，任何人家的田地里有了害虫，都要想法赶快除尽，以免连累大家。大家发现邻户、邻村田地里有了害虫，也应该像自己田地里有了害虫一样，热心地帮助别人除治。这样才能把虫害很快消灭。今年河南省麦蚜严重时，省人民政府首长亲自动手，动员省府干部和河南大学师生一千多人下乡捕虫。去年，许多地方的机关学校人员和一些城市、集镇的市民、家庭妇女和工商业者，都自愿下乡帮助农民捕虫。这是一种爱国行为，值得大家学习。
    防治虫害，要下很大的决心。就是说，要彻底打，连续打，不获全胜，决不停止。无论什么害虫，无论用什么好方法都不能一次除尽，一定要长期努力，才能消灭。过去，有的地方除虫时，起初很努力，把害虫打得差不多了，可是没有坚持除尽；过了些时，虫害又继续发展，到后来又要花很大的力量去打，浪费了很多人力。也有些人对除虫工作缺乏信心，看到一大片虫子，就以为没法打尽；甚至还有人迷信“虫子是天生、越打越多”，这都是不对的。只要大家努力防治，虫害是可以消灭的。去年，全国曾经有一万万亩以上庄稼发生虫害，但经过群众努力除治，一般地区都没有成灾。今年，我们除虫的经验比去年多了，准备也比去年充分，只要大家早动手，坚持奋斗，胜利是更有把握的。
    在防治虫害工作中，大家要学习防治虫害的常识
    （可以参考四月二十四日人民日报登的中央农业部“关于一九五二年农作物几种主要病虫害防治作法的提要”和各地编印的关于防治虫害的各种小册子），摸到害虫发生和成长的规律，找出防治虫害的窍门。同时要注意交流经验，传播群众创造的各种防治虫害的好办法。能够购置杀虫药和喷雾器的，当然要尽量用药械去治虫。但没有药械的，用各种土办法也能够把害虫消灭。中国农民的智慧是无穷的，大家只要多动脑筋，就能想出好办法。例如河南新安县农民最近创造了席拉、簸箕推等十五种办法，捕杀了麦蚜虫等二十万斤。河南洛阳专区偃师县的智光庆，今年创造了一种很简便的“四条腿捕虫器”，一个人每天可以捕杀二十亩地的小麦吸浆虫。他的创造受到了偃师县人民政府的奖励。洛阳专署也发出通报，向全区推广这一捕虫工具。我们大家要学习这些除虫中的好的经验和办法，并且展开县与县、区与区、村与村、组与组、户与户、人与人之间的竞赛，把害虫杀尽，保证今年爱国丰产任务的胜利完成。
