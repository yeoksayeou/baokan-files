　　After the "Three-Anti" Campaign, the Casting Workshop of Pingxiang Mining Machinery Factory Strengthens Worker Unity and Reduces Scrap Rate
　　Editor: Our Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Factory's casting workshop used to produce a lot of scrap, averaging seventeen or eighteen pieces per month, which greatly affected the mine's production and construction. The reason for the scrap was that the workers were secretly disagreeing, sulking with each other, and not trying to solve the difficulties. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the workers all recognized and criticized their wrong thoughts. Foreman Luo Hansheng took the lead in making a profound self-criticism, saying that he didn't cooperate with everyone in the past because he was afraid that if he told others his skills, he would lose his job. The situation of unity and mutual assistance and good production has thus unfolded. Labor model Peng Yisheng took the initiative to find tricks and improved the working method of casting cableway bucket pulleys. Thanks to Peng Yisheng's lead, the young worker Tang Haiquan increased the number of Qian Falan castings from 30 to 68 per worker. Other workers also took active action. The casting workshop only produced one piece of scrap in April. Wu Bangguo

　　萍乡矿机厂铸工间在“三反”后
    工人加强团结废品率降低
    编辑同志：我们萍乡煤矿机厂铸工间过去老出废活，每月平均有十七、八件，使矿山生产建设受到很大影响。出废活的原因是工人们暗地里闹意见，互相赌气，不想办法解决困难。“三反”运动后，工人们都认识和批判了错误思想。领工骆汉生首先作了深刻的检讨，他说过去不和大家合作，是怕把技术告诉了别人，自己会失业。团结互助、搞好生产的局面由此展开。劳动模范彭义生首先积极找窍门，改良了铸缆道吊斗滑轮的工作法。由于彭义生带头，青年工人唐海泉铸千法蓝由每工铸三十个提高到六十八个，其他工人也都积极行动起来。铸工间四月份只出了一件废品。　巫邦国
