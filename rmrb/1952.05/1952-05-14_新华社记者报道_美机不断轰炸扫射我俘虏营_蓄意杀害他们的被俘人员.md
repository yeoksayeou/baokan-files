Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 13th. This reporter has just learned from the press office of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation to the armistice talks: Four prisoners of war who were seriously injured in the strafing of our Jiangdong prisoner of war camp by U.S. aircraft on the 11th of this month, despite the efforts of our medical personnel to rescue them, two of them are on the verge of death due to their severe injuries. The American aggressors, who sing the praises of "humanitarianism," have intensified their bombing and strafing of their own captured personnel, despite our repeated serious protests and the angry appeals of their own captured personnel, becoming more and more frequent.

On January 14th of this year, U.S. aircraft bombed our Jiangdong prisoner of war camp, killing and wounding 79 prisoners of war in one instance. On March 16th, U.S. aircraft strafed the Changcheng prisoner of war camp, wounding one British prisoner. On May 4th and 5th, U.S. aircraft again bombed and strafed the Changcheng prisoner of war camp. For this reason, our chief liaison officer, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan, notified the U.S. liaison officer, Colonel Kenney, on the 8th, requesting the U.S. side to pay serious attention. As with previous similar incidents, Kenney replied lightly that the U.S. side "will investigate."

However, while the U.S. side's "investigation" of the previous incident was still "in progress," and while figures like Joye and Ridgway were singing the praises of "humanitarianism," the prisoners of war in the Jiangdong prisoner of war camp were subjected to another strafing and massacre.

Observers here point out that the locations of our prisoner of war camps have long been marked on detailed maps and handed over to the U.S. side, and each prisoner of war camp has obvious markings according to the agreement between the two sides; and that the continuous bombing and strafing by U.S. aircraft is clearly a planned action to deliberately murder their own captured personnel.

The American aggressors' hatred for their own captured personnel is not difficult to understand. Because the prisoners of war from the United States and its vassal states have realized that they are being driven to fight an unjust war, and in their many public statements, in the hundreds of letters they send to their relatives and friends every day via Panmunjom, they demand the release and repatriation of all prisoners of war on both sides, demand an early armistice in Korea, and demand world peace. This has angered the U.S. imperialists. According to news from the United States, the U.S. authorities have already set up concentration camps, preparing to imprison the repatriated U.S. prisoners of war and conduct so-called "loyalty tests" when they are forced to accept the armistice. For the bloodthirsty American aggressors, today's bombs and machine guns are, of course, more effective and easier than future "loyalty tests."

### 新华社记者报道  美机不断轰炸扫射我俘虏营  蓄意杀害他们的被俘人员

    美机不断轰炸扫射我俘虏营  蓄意杀害他们的被俘人员
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社记者顷自朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团新闻处获悉：本月十一日因美机扫射我方江东俘虏营而惨遭重伤的战俘四名，虽经我方医务人员努力救治，但其中二名因伤势过重，已濒危境。高唱“人道主义”的美国侵略者，对于他们自己被俘人员的轰炸扫射，虽经我方多次严重抗议，虽经他们自己的被俘人员愤怒呼吁，反而变本加厉，愈来愈频繁。
    今年一月十四日，美机即曾轰炸我方江东俘虏营，一次即炸死、炸伤战俘七十九名。三月十六日，美机扫射昌城俘虏营，伤英籍俘虏一名。五月四日、五日，美机再度轰炸扫射昌城俘虏营。为此我方首席联络官张春山上校曾于八日通知美方联络官肯尼上校，提请美方严重注意。一如历次发生的同类事件一样，肯尼只轻描淡写地答称美方“将进行调查”。
    但是，就在美方上一次事件“调查”还在“进行”，就在乔埃、李奇微之流高唱“人道主义”之时，江东俘虏营的战俘又遭到另一次扫射和残杀。
    此间观察家指出：我方俘虏营的位置，早已用详尽地图标明，交给美方，各俘虏营都按双方协议设有明显的标志；而美机这样连续地进行轰炸扫射，显系蓄意杀害他们自己被俘人员的有计划行动。
    美国侵略者这种仇视他们自己被俘人员的行为，是不难了解的。因为美国及其附庸国的战俘，已经觉悟到他们是被驱使来进行一个非正义的战争，因而在他们的许多公开声明里，在每天经由板门店发给他们亲友的成百封信件中，他们要求释放及遣返双方全部战俘，要求朝鲜早日停战，要求世界和平。这就触怒了美帝国主义者。根据美国方面消息，美国当局已经设好集中营，预备在一旦被迫接受停战时，囚禁被遣返的美方被俘人员，进行所谓“忠诚测验”。而对嗜杀成性的美国侵略者说来，今天的炸弹和机关枪，当然是比将来的“忠诚测验”更为有效而简单易行的。
