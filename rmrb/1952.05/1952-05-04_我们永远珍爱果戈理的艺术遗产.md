    We Will Always Cherish Gogol's Artistic Legacy
    Shā Tīng
    The great Russian writer Gogol once added a subtitle to his comedy "Marriage": "Absolutely Incredible Event." In fact, not only "Marriage" but many other stories in Gogol's works are also unusual, such as the short story "The Nose" and the novel "Dead Souls." A tenth-rank civil servant actually lost his nose in a daze and unexpectedly found it again: still sitting on his pockmarked face as if nothing had happened. Isn't this a "bizarre" story?
    However, it is built on real life. Think about it, for a young bureaucrat in the old society who loves beauty, likes to show off, always wants to climb up, and is flirting with women, the nose is such an important thing—but it just disappears! And in such a peculiar situation, the empty and boring nature of a bureaucrat is even more exposed. In fact, Gogol did expose the frivolous faces of all bureaucrats without any illusions because of the bizarre event.
    As for "Dead Souls," the characters who move in this seemingly bizarre story are very ordinary. Even if the times and countries are different, when I reread it, I often cannot help but think of those familiar figures who were recently taken down from their pedestals by the peasant masses in the past two or three years. This comes from the high artistic achievement Gogol reached in shaping characters: he not only made an extremely typical generalization of the bureaucrats and landlords of Russia at that time but also profoundly exposed the evils inherent in all parasitic classes under the private ownership system. These bloodsuckers who gain without labor use the blood and sweat of the people to enrich themselves, but precisely because of this, they themselves are also spiritually degenerated to a terrible degree. For example, from Plyushkin, who is so greedy to the point of stupidity, can we smell any trace of humanity? And that absurdly foolish Nozdryov, besides gambling, drinking, and lying, is simply incapable of anything else. As for Chichikov, he is a living embodiment of the selfish and self-interested thoughts of the exploiting class, an open robber.
    Selecting social types from ordinary life especially requires the insight of an artist. Because the more ordinary something is, the more accustomed people are to it and the less attention they pay to it, let alone revealing the truth of life from it. But Gogol fully possessed the talent of this great artist. Moreover, through his powerful form of expression, each of his characters unfolds his personality, habits, and all secret life desires to the reader through every action and detail of life. Manilov is definitely different from Sobakevich because what he cares about is a series of self-righteous, elegant, but extremely boring daydreams, not focusing all his strength on a piece of lamb rib. And although both are greedy, Plyushkin is obviously different from Sobakevich, the former would rather tighten his belt than use a piece of moldy bread. But these various images unanimously prove to the world that the exploitation system is evil.
    We usually like to call the powerful expression of the great Russian writer "exaggeration" and attribute it to him being a satirical writer. This is worth considering. Because it is very obvious that this is not a simple matter of expression, but the most basic thing lies in Gogol's unparalleled knowledge of the old Russian society and his unparalleled deep love for Russia and the Russian people. This is the first condition that every great writer should possess, otherwise, he cannot grasp the typical characteristics of life, let alone shape an image that makes readers full of passionate yearning or hatred, and our general so-called "exaggeration" will lose its authenticity and powerful infectious power. However, it is indeed true that if a writer attempts to integrate his love for the motherland and the people into accurate and unmistakable descriptions, it is not an easy task, which requires long-term ideological training and strict labor discipline.
    Gogol's love for great Russia is particularly strongly expressed in "Dead Souls" through those rich lyrical digressions. Through the description of childhood memories and natural landscapes, the author not only sharply contrasts the ignorance and evil of the bureaucratic landlords but also shows his conviction in the great future of Russia. However, due to the limitations of historical conditions and class background, when he succeeded in seeking heroic figures and great characters from the ancient Ukrainian history to inspire the people; but when he violated the reality of Russian life and attempted to revive the dead souls of the noble landlords, Gogol suffered a serious setback, and his genius was powerless.
    On the occasion of the centenary of the death of this great Russian writer, although China's feudal landlords and bureaucrats have also been kicked off the historical stage, the artistic legacy left by Gogol still has many things for us to learn from. His creation has a particularly profound educational significance for Chinese writers who are undergoing ideological transformation.

    我们永远珍爱果戈理的艺术遗产
    沙汀
    伟大的俄国作家果戈理，曾经给他自己的喜剧“婚事”加过一个小题：“完全离奇的事件。”其实不但“婚事”如此，果戈理其他许多作品中的故事，也是不平常的，例如短篇小说“鼻子”和长篇小说“死魂灵”。一个十品文官竟会胡胡涂涂不见了自己的鼻子，终于又出人意表地找到了它：依旧原封未动坐在自己有着面疱的脸孔上。这不是很
    “离奇”的故事吗？
    但是，它是建筑在现实生活上面的。想一想吧，鼻子，这对旧社会中一个爱漂亮、爱排场、无时无刻不想往上面爬，而且正在向女性们施展手段的青年官僚，该是何等重大的物事，——但它偏偏是不见了！而在这样一种颇为别致的情势下，一个空虚无聊的官僚的本性，也就更加原形毕露。事实上，果戈理确也借此暴露了一切官僚的轻薄嘴脸，并未因为事件的离奇产生任何错觉。
    至于“死魂灵”，在这个看来好像离奇的故事中活动的人物，却又极为平凡。纵使时代不同，国度不同，当我重读它的时候，往往情不自禁地联想起那些最近三两年间才被农民群众下掉架子的熟识人物。这是从果戈理塑造人物时所达到的高度艺术成就来的：他不仅对当时俄国的官僚地主作了极为典型的概括，同时更深刻地暴露了私有制度下一切寄生阶级所必然具有的恶德。这些不劳而获的吸血虫，他们借人民的血汗以自肥，但是正因为如此，他们自己却也在精神上堕落到可怕的程度。比如，从那个贪婪到了愚蠢地步的泼留希金身上，我们何尝嗅得出半点人气？而那个荒唐透顶的罗士特来夫，除开赌博，酗酒、撒诳、简直就百无一能。至于乞乞可夫，那更是一个剥削阶级自私自利思想的活的化身，一个公开的强盗。
    从平凡生活中选取社会典型，这是特别需要一个艺术家的洞察力的。因为愈是平凡，就谁都见惯不惊，不加注意，更谈不上从中揭示出生活的真理。而果戈理却正充分具有这种伟大艺术家的才能。而且，通过他那强有力的表现形式，他的每个人物都借自己的每一行动和生活细节向读者展开自己的个性、习尚、以及一切隐秘的生活愿望。码尼罗夫决不同于梭巴开维支，因为他所关心的是一系列自以为高尚、优雅，实则无聊之极的痴想，并不专在一片羊肋脊身上发挥他的全部力量。而虽则同是贪鄙，泼留希金又显然有别于梭巴开维支，前者是宁肯勒紧裤带，而不愿动用一块发霉的面包的。但是这些形形色色的形象，却又莫不一致现身说法地向世人证明：剥削制度就是罪恶。
    我们通常总爱把伟大俄国作家强有力的表现，称为“夸张”，而归因于他是讽刺作家。这是值得我们斟酌的。因为十分显然，这不是一个简单的表现形式问题，而最为基本的，倒在于果戈理对旧的俄国社会具有无比丰富的知识，对俄国和俄国人民具有无比深湛的热爱。这才是每一个伟大作家应该首先具备的条件，否则，他不可能捉住生活中典型性的特点，更不可能塑造一个使读者满怀激情向往，或者憎恨的形象，而我们一般的所谓“夸张”，也就会失掉真实性和强大的感染力量。不过，这倒是的确的，一个作家如果企图将自己对于祖国人民的热爱融注在准确无误的描写当中，不是容易的事，这里需要长期的思想锻炼和严格的劳动纪律。
    果戈理对于伟大俄罗斯的热爱，在“死魂灵”中，通过那些丰富的抒情插话，表现得特别强烈。借着童年回忆和自然风景的描写，作者不但十分鲜明地对比了官僚地主的愚昧、邪恶，同时更表现出他对俄国伟大前途充满了何等样的确信。然而，由于历史条件同阶级出身的限制，当他为了给人民以鼓舞，从往古乌克兰历史中觅取英雄人物和伟大性格的时候，他成功了；但当他违反俄罗斯的生活现实，企图驱使贵族地主的死灵魂复活的时候，果戈理遭到了严重的挫折，他的天才也就无能为力了。
    当此伟大俄国作家逝世百周年之际，虽然中国的封建地主、官僚也已经从历史舞台上滚蛋了；果戈理所遗留下来的艺术遗产，足供我们借镜之处仍然是很多的。他的创作，对于我们正在进行思想改造的中国作家，尤其具有深长的教育意义。
