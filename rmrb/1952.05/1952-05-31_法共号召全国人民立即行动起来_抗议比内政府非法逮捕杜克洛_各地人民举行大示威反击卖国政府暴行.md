    TASS, Paris, May 29th:
    "L'Humanité" has published a report regarding the arrest of Jacques Duclos, member of the French National Assembly and Secretary of the French Communist Party, stating: Duclos and his wife, Gilberte Duclos, were arrested together after leaving the "L'Humanité" editorial office at 10 PM. Police attacked their car and arrested both of them. Their whereabouts are currently unknown. The "L'Humanité" editorial office attempted to contact the authorities by phone but received no response.
    The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement in "L'Humanité" regarding Duclos's arrest, saying: The French people are becoming increasingly angered by the policy of reviving the forces of German revanchism and militarism, a fact that deeply disturbs the French war government. The unprecedented scale of demonstrations in Paris and across the country against Ridgway and in support of peace has further alarmed the government. It is for this reason that the government, in collusion with its American masters, has taken this heinous decision to arrest Duclos. This extremely serious fascist measure has aroused boundless indignation among factory workers and the people nationwide. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party calls on all working people, all democrats, and all French people who cherish the independence of France and the peace of France, which is in danger, to unanimously express their irrepressible and strong protest and demand the immediate release of Duclos.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: Paris dispatch: The French government's unprecedented act of violently and illegally arresting Jacques Duclos, the Secretary of the French Communist Party and member of the National Assembly, following the massive demonstrations by the people of Paris protesting the visit of American "germ warfare general" Ridgway to France, has aroused boundless anger among the French people. Under the call of the French Communist Party, the working people of all of France have taken action to resolutely fight back against this frantic suppression of patriotic people by the treacherous Binet government.
    Duclos was arrested late on the 28th. On the 29th, massive protest strikes and demonstrations erupted in all major cities of France. Workers in all machine factories in Paris and many gas plant workers went on strike. Many factory workers sent delegations to the Ministry of Interior to lodge serious protests. In Marseille, many factory workers stopped work. Factory workers in Dalby and Montluçon, shipyard workers and dockworkers in Bordeaux, and coal miners in Nord and Pas-de-Calais also went on strike to protest the arrest of Duclos. On the same day, Communist parliamentarians Grenier and Guyonnet harshly criticized the government's illegal arrest of Duclos in the French National Assembly and demanded Duclos's immediate release.
    In the face of the nationwide tide of protest and anger, the Binet government妄想妄想 to stop the resistance of the French people by intensifying the persecution of Duclos and the Communist Party. But this can only further expose their true colors as lackeys of the United States who openly oppose the French people, and can have no other result. When the French government conducted an illegal interrogation of Duclos on the 29th and accused Duclos of fabricated "crimes against public order," Duclos's defense lawyer solemnly pointed out that the French government's shameful behavior completely violated the constitutional provisions on guaranteeing basic human rights and not arresting members of parliament. In court, Duclos personally denounced the actions of the French rulers, like "the slaves of their foreign masters." On the same day, the French government also ordered the confiscation of "L'Humanité" and "Libération" in Paris, as well as nine democratic newspapers in Marseille, Saint-Étienne, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lille, Toulon, Rennes, Valenciennes, and Montpellier.
    Under these circumstances, the French working people and all patriotic people have further intensified their struggle. The French General Confederation of Labour (CGT) issued a call late on the 29th, after Duclos was formally charged and sent to prison, calling on workers nationwide to hold even larger-scale strikes and demonstrations. The CGT Executive Bureau said in its call: French workers should act quickly, gather in every enterprise, and hold strikes and demonstrations to defend peace, bread, and freedom. The Executive Bureau called on workers to demand the release of Duclos and all other imprisoned people, to defend their rights, and to defeat the conspiracy against the workers. On the 29th, the Seine Prefecture Peace Committee also published a notice in "L'Humanité" protesting the French government's fascist atrocities. The Peace Committee called on all patriots to continue the struggle for France's national independence and for peace. Now, the great mass movement to rescue Duclos and oppose the American and French reactionaries has begun throughout France.

    法共号召全国人民立即行动起来
    抗议比内政府非法逮捕杜克洛
    各地人民举行大示威反击卖国政府暴行
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十九日讯：
    “人道报”顷就法国国民议会议员、法国共产党书记杜克洛被捕事发表消息说：杜克洛和他的妻子吉尔布丽特·杜克洛在下午十时离开“人道报”编辑部之后同时被捕。警察攻击他们的座车，逮捕了他们两人。杜克洛和他的妻子被拘禁在什么地方，现在还不知道。人道报编辑部曾打电话询问当局，但得不到回答。
    法国共产党政治局在“人道报”上就杜克洛被捕事发表声明说：法国全体人民对于复活德国复仇主义者和军国主义者的力量的政策一天比一天愤怒，法国战争政府眼看到这个事实而感到非常不安。巴黎和全国各地反对李奇微、拥护和平的示威规模空前壮阔，更使政府十分惶恐。正是为了这个缘故，政府便和它的美国主子串通一起，采取了这个逮捕杜克洛的罪恶滔天的决定。这种极端严重的法西斯式的措施，激起了各工厂工人和全国人民的无比愤慨。法国共产党政治局号召全体劳动人民、全体民主分子以及全体珍爱法兰西独立和珍爱已处于危险状态中的和平的法国人民，一致表示他们不可抑制的强烈抗议，要求马上释放杜克洛。
    【新华社三十日讯】巴黎消息：法国政府在巴黎人民举行抗议美国“细菌战将军”李奇微来法的大示威以后，非法逮捕法国共产党书记、国民议会议员杜克洛的空前暴行，已经激起法国人民无比的愤怒。全法国的劳动人民已经在法国共产党的号召下行动起来，坚决还击比内卖国政府这种对于爱国人民的疯狂镇压。
    杜克洛是二十八日深晚被捕的。二十九日，法国各主要城市就爆发了声势浩大的抗议罢工和抗议示威。巴黎所有机器厂的工人和许多煤气厂的工人都举行了罢工。许多工厂工人派遣代表团前往内政部提出严重抗议。在马赛，有不少工厂的工人停止了工作。达尔卑、蒙律松的工厂工人，波尔多的造船工人和码头工人以及诺尔省和加莱海峡省的煤矿工人也都举行了罢工，抗议逮捕杜克洛。同一天，共产党议员格勒尼埃和刚芬在法国国民议会中对政府对杜克洛的非法逮捕，提出严厉抨击，要求立即释放杜克洛。
    在全国人民的抗议怒潮面前，比内政府妄想以加紧对杜克洛和共产党的迫害来制止法国人民的反抗。但是这除了进一步暴露自己投靠美国而公然与法国人民为敌的真面目外，不可能有任何结果。当法国政府在二十九日对杜克洛进行非法审讯，并且以捏造的“危害治安罪”控告杜克洛时，杜克洛的辩护律师严正指出，法国政府这种可耻的行为，完全破坏了宪法关于保障基本人权和不得逮捕议员的规定。在法庭上，杜克洛亲自痛斥法国统治者的行径，一如“他们外国主子的奴才”。同一天，法国政府又下令没收巴黎“人道报”、“解放报”以及马赛、圣亚田、波尔多、土鲁斯、里尔、土伦、勒纳、瓦尔米和蒙彼利埃等城市的九种民主报纸。
    在这种情况下，法国劳动人民和一切爱国人民进一步加紧了他们的斗争。法国总工会二十九日晚在杜克洛被正式起诉并解往监狱以后，立即号召全国劳动者举行更大规模的罢工和示威。总工会执行局在发出的号召中说：法国工人应迅速行动起来，集合在每一个企业中，举行罢工和示威，以保卫和平、面包和自由。执行局号召工人们要求释放杜克洛和其他一切被监禁的人，保卫自己的权利，以击败反对工人的阴谋。二十九日，塞纳省和平委员会也在“人道报”上发表通告，抗议法国政府的法西斯暴行。和平委员会号召一切爱国者继续为法国的民族独立、为和平而斗争。现在，营救杜克洛，反对美法反动派的伟大群众运动已在全法国开始了。
