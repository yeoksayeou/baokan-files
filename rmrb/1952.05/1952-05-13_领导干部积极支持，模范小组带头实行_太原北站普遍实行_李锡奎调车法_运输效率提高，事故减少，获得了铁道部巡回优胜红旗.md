    Under the leadership of labor model Zhang Xin, the Zhang Xin shunting team of the Taiyuan North Station of the Tianjin Railway Administration's Taiyuan Branch studied the "Li Xikui shunting method," improving transportation efficiency and reducing accidents. The Zhang Xin shunting team had no accidents in nine months and was named a model advanced group in Taiyuan City.

    Last September, this team accepted the task of piloting the "Li Xikui shunting method." At the beginning of the trial, some workers in the group had concerns, believing that: "In the past, we made mistakes even with shunting notification slips; now we have to learn the 'Li Xikui shunting method,' which has no shunting notification slips, so it will be even easier to make mistakes." Linkman Dong Youfu also hesitated and said: "Learning the 'Li Xikui shunting method' requires education. We haven't studied for half our lives, so I'm afraid we can't handle this shunting method." The leading cadres of Taiyuan North Station pointed out: "It's not scary to be uneducated. As long as we are willing to put in effort and carefully study, we will definitely succeed." The education of the leading cadres encouraged their enthusiasm for learning. Leading cadres also helped them solve difficulties in learning. In this way, the concerns of the comrades in the group were dispelled.

    Last November, Zhang Xin went to the Northeast to study the "Li Xikui shunting method" in person, which also strengthened their confidence in learning. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the leading cadres of Taiyuan North Station still organized study classes to allow everyone to systematically study the advanced "Li Xikui shunting method." After studying, the workers in the Zhang Xin team said: "'Li Xikui shunting method' is great! Once you master it, you are not afraid of not completing the task!"

    Since the Zhang Xin team implemented the "Li Xikui shunting method," it has made significant achievements. On January 16 this year, after they completed the compilation of train 7473, they implemented Li Xikui's re-inspection system and discovered that a wagon was a 40-ton iron wagon, but the marked tonnage was small and unclear. They immediately reported this situation to the operations room and corrected it. On February 6, when dismantling train 2802, they conscientiously implemented the re-inspection system and found that the car number was inserted incorrectly, which prevented an error. According to Li Xikui's method, they took the initiative to contact relevant departments when they received tasks. On January 15, they compiled three trains, shunting 64 wagons, and used only 36 minutes, creating a new record for the Taiyuan Branch. In order to prevent accidents, they remained vigilant at all times. One day, they hooked up six wagons and connected the air pipes. They carefully checked again and finally found a shortcoming, preventing an accident of broken air pipes. Another time, Dong Youfu, the linkman of their team, saw a coal car from the locomotive depot parked in a dangerous place. Dong Youfu rushed to stop it, averting a serious accident.

    The Zhang Xin team has learned Li Xikui's advanced shunting methods and established many systems, all of which have good results. After the Zhang Xin team successfully implemented the "Li Xikui shunting method," all the shunting teams at Taiyuan North Station implemented the "Li Xikui shunting method." In January, the entire station overfulfilled the prescribed tasks. The stop time was shortened from eight hours to seven hours, and the transfer time was shortened from three and two-tenths hours to two and two-tenths hours, greatly improving transportation efficiency and saving the country the equivalent of more than 189,000 catties of millet in wealth. Taiyuan North Station was commended twice by the Tianjin Railway Administration and awarded the Ministry of Railways' mobile excellent red banner. Recently, the Zhang Xin shunting team has also created a new record of one hundred days without accidents. They said with confidence: "Wherever the 'Li Xikui shunting method' is learned and advanced work experience is mastered, the tasks there will surely be completed."

    领导干部积极支持，模范小组带头实行
    太原北站普遍实行“李锡奎调车法”
    运输效率提高，事故减少，获得了铁道部巡回优胜红旗
    天津铁路管理局太原分局太原北站张鑫调车组，在劳动模范张鑫的带动下，学习“李锡奎调车法”，提高了运输效率，减少了事故。张鑫调车组九个月内没有发生事故，被评为太原全市模范先进小组。
    在去年九月，这个小组接受了试行“李锡奎调车法”的任务。在开始试行时，小组里有些工人有顾虑，认为：“过去有调车通知单还出错；现在要学习‘李锡奎调车法’，没有调车通知单，那更容易出错了。”连结员董有富也吞吞吐吐地说：“学习‘李锡奎调车法’，得有文化。咱们半辈子没念过书，学这个调车法，恐怕吃不消。”太原北站的领导干部就指出：“没文化，不可怕。只要我们肯下功夫，细心钻研，定会成功。”领导干部的教育，鼓舞了他们学习的热情。领导干部还帮助他们解决学习上的困难。这样，小组里的同志们的顾虑就解除了。
    去年十一月，张鑫去东北实地学习了“李锡奎调车法”，这也增强了他们学习的信心。在“三反”运动中，太原北站领导干部仍组织了学习班，让大家系统地学习先进的“李锡奎调车法”。经过了学习，张鑫小组工友们说：“‘李锡奎调车法’真棒！掌握了它，不怕完不成任务！”
    张鑫小组实行了“李锡奎调车法”以后，做出了显著的成绩。在今年一月十六日，他们编完七四七三次列车，实行李锡奎的复检制度，发现一辆车是四十吨的铁车皮，但标记吨数的字很小，又不清楚。他们立即把这个情况报告给运转室，改正过来。在二月六日，解体二八○二次列车时，他们认真地执行了复检制度，发现车牌插错了，又防止了错误。他们按照李锡奎的办法，在接到任务时，就主动地和有关部门联系；在一月十五日，他们编组了三列车，调动了六十四辆车，只用了三十六分钟，创造了太原分局的新纪录。为了防止事故，他们时时刻刻提高警惕。有一天，他们挂好了六个车，接好了风管。他们再仔细检查，终于发现了缺点，防止了折断风管事故。又有一次，他们小组的连结员董有富看见机务段的一辆煤车停放在危险地方，董有富急忙去制止，免除了一次恶性事故。
    张鑫小组学习了李锡奎的先进调车方法，建立了很多制度，都有良好的效果。这个小组实行“李锡奎调车法”成功以后，太原北站所有的调车组，都实行了“李锡奎调车法”。一月份全站超额完成规定的任务。停站时间由八小时缩短为七小时，中转时间由三点二时缩短为二点二小时，大大地提高了运输效率，给国家节省了相当于十八万九千多斤小米的财富。太原北站受到天津铁路管理局两次表扬，获得铁道部巡回优胜红旗。最近，张鑫调车组又创造了百日无事故的新纪录。他们满怀信心地说：“那里学习了‘李锡奎调车法’，掌握了先进的工作经验，那里的任务就准能完成。”
