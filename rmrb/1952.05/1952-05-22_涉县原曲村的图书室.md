    Editor's Note: The direction of the library in Yuanqu Village, She County, Hebei Province, is basically correct, and its methods are relatively specific, and thus it has achieved certain results. Rural libraries in various places should learn and apply its experience. The experience of the Yuanqu Village Library in She County shows that the establishment of rural libraries is of great help in improving the political and cultural level of farmers and promoting various tasks. Therefore, under possible conditions, villages with people's schools should establish libraries, and natural villages can jointly organize mobile libraries to enrich rural cultural life and more effectively promote the increase production and practice economy movement.
    How the library was established:
    In February of last year, Qin Junshan, a village cadre, Shen Jie, a teacher at the people's school, and Yao Futing, the secretary of the Youth League, initiated the establishment of a library in the village public office on the east side of the main street of Yuanqu Village in the Fifth District of She County after research by all village cadres. The library has a total of 532 books, including four categories: natural science, agriculture, culture and education, health, and current affairs policies. In order to facilitate mass reading, they are divided into four columns: popular reading materials, encyclopedia series, workers' reading materials, workers' popular library, and children's library. In order to give full play to the role of the library and cooperate with the teaching of the people's school and the central work, a library committee was also established. After discussion by the cadres, it was decided that the village culture and education director would serve as the director, and one teacher from the people's school would be selected as the deputy director. There are four sections: a writing section, responsible for writing materials for the blackboard newspaper and the radio station; a communications section, responsible for mobilizing the masses to contribute to the blackboard newspaper; a management section, responsible for the management and registration of books; and a publicity section, responsible for propaganda in coordination with the central work. Each section has one leader to lead the work of the section. The library's opening hours are: the third, sixth, and ninth day of the month during the slack farming season, and the fifth and tenth day of the month during the busy farming season; if it is rainy or a holiday, it is open all day.
    The borrowing situation of the masses
    After the library opened, the elderly came to see the wall charts, the young came to see the picture books, and the male and female students of the people's school came to borrow books, and it was very crowded. According to statistics for half a month from February 7th to 21st last year: about 200 people visited every day, and an average of 13 people borrowed books every day. When it came to the busy farming season, the number not only did not decrease, but increased a lot. From October 10th to 29th, there were 49 people borrowing books and more than 170 people reading in 19 days. When the exhibition of "Happy Children" pictures was held, the number of visitors during the day reached 466; by dusk, all the men, women, old and young in the village came to visit, and the number increased to 1,264. Thus, in the nine months since the library was established, 735 people have borrowed books (including 82 women) and 4,964 people have visited. According to our investigation, as long as the books meet the needs of the masses, the masses love to read them. For example, "Rural Practical Writing" has been borrowed 8 times, "The Story of Li Zicheng" 13 times, "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" 5 times, "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" 28 times, and "Learn to Read with Pictures" 111 times.
    Because the farmers have a low level of education and poor reading ability, some people need us to point out the main points of the reading materials, and some people need us to help them mark the notes; we take a variety of ways to help them gain knowledge from books. For example, when there are pictures, we are responsible for explaining them. When explaining the wall chart "History of U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against China," Uncle Xing Zhixian, who is over sixty years old, said: "How are the American devils with their teeth and claws doing in Korea?" The explainer pointed to the map of Korea and explained the war situation in Korea and the victory of the Chinese and Korean People's forces. Then he said, "I understand. It's really convenient to have a library. I have to come every day from now on!"
    Combining with central work for publicity
    How the library publicizes the central work is an important issue. We have implemented the policy of the library serving politics and the economy, thus improving the political consciousness of the masses and enriching their production knowledge.
    When mobilizing the masses of farmers to treat cotton aphids, the mutual aid groups looked for ways to treat cotton aphids. Yao Xiang of the library summarized the methods published in the newspapers and told them to Yao Yuchang, the head of the mutual aid group. After listening, Yao Yuchang convened a meeting of all the mutual aid groups in the village, introduced the method of treating cotton aphids, and then assigned tasks to experiment in more than 20 acres of cotton fields. In a few days, the cotton grew well. The publicity section of the library quickly broadcast the news and posted it on the blackboard newspaper, saying that "Yao Yuchang's method of eradicating cotton aphids is good." In this way, the masses of the whole village immediately launched a movement to treat cotton aphids.
    When signing patriotic pacts, some farmers lacked confidence, and they did not know why and how to sign patriotic pacts. The director of the library committee convened a meeting of all the library cadres, studied the documents for signing "patriotic pacts," and then worked with the village people's government to study the methods, and mobilized the masses to sign patriotic pacts by street and area. As a result, more than 350 households signed patriotic pacts. When revising the patriotic pacts for the second time, the library cadres and the village cadres revised all the unrealistic patriotic pacts in the village.
    When carrying out preferential treatment work last year, we first held a preparatory meeting and a discussion meeting on preferential treatment work before the "August 1st" Army Day, and then organized people's school teachers and students to mobilize the masses by using street food markets, so that mass preferential treatment work was carried out. The military families were very satisfied. For example, Qin Yongxiang, a military family member, wrote to his son at the front, saying: "...The village takes care of the firewood, and the masses cultivate the land for you, so there are no difficulties. You must fight well on the front line to answer the care of the village cadres and the masses for us!"
    What role does the library play?
    In general, the role played by the library is, first of all, to enrich the cultural and scientific knowledge of the masses. Because the library cadres have strengthened their assistance to borrowers, and the readers are willing to study hard, the cultural level of the general public has been significantly improved. For example, Wu Youlin, who is in his thirties, goes to the library to read whenever he has time. When he is in production, he takes the book to the field and learns in his spare time. He writes down the words he does not know and asks the comrades in the library when he returns the book. In this way, in nine months, he has learned more than 1,000 characters. According to our understanding, now the average farmer has a general understanding of common scientific knowledge of agricultural production, such as what nutrients plants need, the relationship between pests and crops, and why diligent hoeing and watering can increase grain production.
    Secondly, it has improved the political understanding of the masses. The masses' demand for political study is very urgent. Whenever they hear about important events at home and abroad or the people's government issues instructions, they rush to borrow newspapers and pamphlets on current affairs policies. On the one hand, because they actually participate in political activities, and on the other hand, because they are educated by newspapers and books, the masses are progressing rapidly. For example, Qin Liwu used to think that the village supply and marketing cooperative was a place to do business and earn money; after reading the book "How to Run the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Well," he realized that the supply and marketing cooperative is a production leading agency that "promotes the sales of agricultural products, organizes farmers' production, cooperation, and mutual assistance." Yao Qingyuan, the director of mediation, used to worry about handling marriage disputes. After reading the books on the marriage law, he knew that marriage at the age of 20 for men and 18 for women is to protect the health of the people; he also understood how to handle the problems of children and property when men and women divorce, and so on. He said: "I didn't dare to manage things before, but now I have a bottom line." Wang Erhan did not understand the significance and policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. After borrowing and reading a pamphlet "Why Suppress Counter-Revolutionaries," he said: "It is impossible not to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Those who should be killed must be killed, those who should be arrested must be arrested, and those who should be controlled must be controlled!"

    涉县原曲村的图书室

    编者按：河北涉县原曲村图书室的方针基本上是正确的，做法也是比较具体的，因而获得了一定的成绩。各地农村图书馆应该学习和运用它的经验。涉县原曲村图书室的经验说明，农村图书室的设立，对于提高农民的政治、文化水平，推进各项工作，都有很大的帮助。因此，在可能的条件下，凡是有民校的村子都应该成立图书室，自然村可以联合组织巡回书库，以充实农村文化生活，更有效地推动增产节约运动。图书室是怎样建立起来的
    去年二月，涉县五区原曲村由村干部秦俊山、民校教员申杰、青年团书记姚福亭发起，经全村干部研究，作出决定，在本村正街路东村公所建立了图书室。图书室内共有五百三十二本书，包括了自然、农业、文教卫生、时事政策等四类书籍。为便于群众阅读，分编为大众读物、百科小丛书、工人读物、工人通俗文库、儿童文库等四栏。为了发挥图书室的作用，配合民校的教学及中心工作，又成立了图书委员会。经干部讨论，决定由村文教主任担任主任，由民校教师中选出一人担任副主任。下设四股：编写股，负责编写黑板报和广播台的材料；通讯股，负责发动群众给黑板报投稿；管理股，负责图书的管理和登记等工作；宣传股，负责配合中心工作进行宣传；各股各推出股长一人，领导本股工作。图书室开放时间：农闲时是三、六、九日，农忙时是逢五逢十；如遇阴雨或节日，白天整日开放。
    群众的借阅情况
    图书室开放以后，年老的来看挂图，年小的看画报，民校的男女学员多来借书，人来人往，拥挤得很。据去年二月七日至二十一日半个月的统计：参观的每天约有二百多人，每日平均有十三个人借书。到了农忙时，人数不但没有减少，反而增加了很多。从十月十日到二十九日的十九天内，借书的有四十九人，阅读的一百七十多人。当展览“幸福的孩子”的画片时，白天的参观人数达到了四百六十六人；到了黄昏，全村男女老少都来参观，人数就增加到一千二百六十四人。这样图书室成立了九个月，借书的就有七百三十五人（内有妇女八十二人），参观的有四千九百六十四人。根据我们的调查，只要图书适合群众需要，群众是很爱看的。如“农村应用文”借出过八次，“李自成故事”十三次，“梁山伯祝英台”五次，“王贵与李香香”二十八次，“看图识字”一百一十一次。
    因为农民的文化程度低，阅读能力差，有的人需要我们给他提出读物的要点，有的人需要我们帮助他标上记号；我们便采取多种多样的办法帮助他们获得书本知识。如遇有图画，我们就负责讲解。在讲“美帝侵华史”的挂图时，六十多岁的邢治贤大伯说：“张牙舞爪的美国鬼子，在朝鲜打得怎么样了？”讲解员就指着朝鲜的地图，说明朝鲜的战争形势和中朝人民部队的胜利情况。接着他又说：“明白了。有了图书室可真方便，往后我得天天来！”
    结合中心工作进行宣传
    图书室如何宣传中心工作是一个重要的问题。我们贯彻执行了图书室为政治、经济服务的方针，因而提高了群众的政治觉悟，丰富了群众的生产知识。
    在发动农民群众治棉蚜时，互助组的人都找治棉蚜的法子。图书室的姚相就把报纸上发表过的办法综合起来，讲给互助组的总组长姚玉昌听。姚玉昌听过以后，便召开全村互助组会议，介绍了治棉蚜的办法，然后分工在二十多亩棉花地里作了试验。不几天，棉花长好了。图书室的宣传股就很快地把这个消息广播出去，黑板报上也登出了消息，说“玉昌除治棉蚜的办法好”。这样全村群众立即展开了治棉蚜运动。
    在订爱国公约时，某些农民缺乏信心，他们不知道为什么、怎样订爱国公约。图书室委员会主任就召开了全体图书室干部会议，共同学习了订“爱国公约”的文件，然后协同村人民政府研究了办法，按街分片地发动群众订立爱国公约。结果，有三百五十多户订立了爱国公约。第二次修订爱国公约时，图书室干部又协同村干部把全村不切合实际的爱国公约都作了修订。
    在去年开展优抚工作时，我们在“八一”建军节前先开了准备会和优抚工作讨论会，然后组织民校教员和学员，利用街头饭市，向群众作了动员，这样群众性的优抚工作便开展起来了。军属感到很满意。例如军属秦永祥给他在前方的儿子写信说：“……烧柴有村上照顾，地有群众代耕，没有困难了。你在前线上要好好打仗，来回答村干部和群众对咱的照顾！”
    图书室起了什么作用
    总起来说，图书室所起的作用，首先是丰富了群众的文化科学知识。由于图书室干部加强了对借阅者的帮助，同时读者又肯认真学习，所以一般群众的文化程度有了显著的提高。例如三十多岁的吴有林，只要有时间，就到图书室里去看书。生产时，他带着书到田里，抽空学习，有不认得的字就记下来，在还书的时候问图书室的同志。这样，九个月的工夫，他就认识了一千多字。根据我们的了解，现在一般农民对农业生产的普通科学知识，如植物需要什么养分，害虫和庄稼的关系，为什么锄地勤、浇水多就能多打粮等问题，大体都已经懂得了。
    其次，提高了群众的政治认识。群众对于政治学习的要求，是很迫切的。每当他们听到国内外发生重要事件或人民政府发布指示时，都争先恐后地来借阅报纸和有关时事政策的小册子。一方面因为实际参加政治活动，一方面因为受到了报刊书籍的教育，群众都进步得很快。如秦立武过去认为村供销社是做买卖挣钱的地方；他看了“怎样办好供销社”一书以后，才明白供销社是“推销农产品，组织农民生产、合作互助”的生产领导机关。调解主任姚庆缘，过去处理婚姻纠纷很发愁。看过了有关婚姻法的书，他知道了男二十岁、女十八岁结婚，是为了保护人民的健康；又懂得了男女离婚时对小孩以及财产问题的处理办法，等等。他说：“早先有事不敢管，现在有了底了。”王二汉在镇压反革命运动中，对镇压反革命的意义和政策都不很了解。当借读了一本“为什么镇压反革命”的小册子后，他说：“不镇压反革命可不行，该杀的就得杀，该逮捕的就得逮捕，该管制的就得管制！”
