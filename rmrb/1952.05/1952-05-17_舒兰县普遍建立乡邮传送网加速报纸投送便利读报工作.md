    Shulan County Universally Establishes Township Postal Delivery Network to Accelerate Newspaper Delivery and Facilitate Newspaper Reading
    The Propaganda Department of the Shulan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to carry out newspaper reading group work, convened a joint meeting of propaganda committee members, transportation committee members, and propaganda worker representatives from various districts in March of this year to study the issue of accelerating newspaper delivery and preventing newspaper loss. Currently, township postal delivery networks have been universally established throughout the county, and township postmen have been selected to be responsible for the timely delivery of newspapers. This method has been warmly praised by the masses. Because the masses can see the newspapers in a timely manner, the number of newspaper reading groups in the county has quickly increased from the original 241 groups to 1,532 groups. Note: Currently, in many rural areas, due to limited transportation conditions, postal delivery is very slow, and newspapers are often delivered together after several days or even more than a week. Cases of missed or incorrect delivery also occur constantly, which greatly affects the development of newspaper reading group work in rural areas. The experience of Shulan County in establishing a township postal delivery network and developing a large number of newspaper reading groups is worth emulating by other regions.

    舒兰县普遍建立乡邮传送网加速报纸投送便利读报工作
    中共吉林省舒兰县委宣传部为开展读报组工作，曾在今年三月间召开各区宣传委员、交通委员及宣传员代表联席会议，研究加速投送报纸和防止报纸遗失的问题。目前，全县各地已普遍建立乡邮传送网，选出乡邮员来负责及时投送报纸。这一办法受到了广大群众的热烈赞许。因为群众能够及时看到报纸，该县读报组很快就从原有的二百四十一组增至一千五百三十二个组。按，目前许多农村因限于交通条件，邮递工作十分迟缓，往往是数天甚至一星期以上的报纸一齐投送，漏投或误投的情况也不断发生，这就大大地影响了农村读报组工作的开展。舒兰县建立乡邮传送网而发展了大量读报组的经验值得各地仿效。　　　　　　　　　　唐大中
