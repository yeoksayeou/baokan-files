    Soviet Science Critiques Idealistic Views in Quantum Mechanics
    He Zuoxiu
    In his famous work "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," Lenin pointed out the crisis existing in physics. This crisis in physics is also extremely serious in quantum mechanics. In recent years, Western bourgeois scholars, led by Bohr and Heisenberg, have advocated the so-called "complementarity principle," using idealistic interpretations to distort the essence of quantum mechanics, even claiming that this "complementarity principle" also applies to biological, psychological, and social laws. As Comrade Zhdanov pointed out in his famous "Speech at the Discussion Meeting on Alexandrov's 'History of Western Philosophy'": "Modern bourgeois science provides new arguments for religion and theology, which must be ruthlessly exposed. ... Similarly, the Kantian fantasies of modern bourgeois atomic physicists lead them to the conclusion that electrons possess 'free will,' and they attempt to describe matter as only the sum of some electromagnetic waves, and other such nonsense." Obviously, such absurd opinions cannot but encounter opposition and ruthless criticism from Soviet scientists. Especially after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued resolutions on literature and art, this critical work has been greatly promoted. Like the work of criticizing idealism in other scientific departments (such as the criticism of Morgan-Weismann's old biology, the conference on Pavlov's doctrine, the conference on the evolution of celestial bodies, and the criticism of the "resonance theory" in chemistry), opposing various forms of idealism in physics is also a link in this series of theoretical struggles against various kinds of idealistic pseudo-science.
    As early as before 1940, the Soviet scientist Nikolsky had already made some criticisms of idealism in quantum mechanics and proposed his own theory of quantum collectives. Until 1947, after Comrade Zhdanov criticized the status quo on the philosophical front, the criticism of quantum mechanics was launched in the "Problems of Philosophy" magazine in 1947 and 1948, particularly discussing the errors of Markov's article "On the Nature of Physical Knowledge" in detail. In the third issue of 1948, the editorial department made a summary. In addition to correcting Markov's mistakes, this discussion also shattered the idealistic foundation of the so-called "complementarity principle." In 1949, Blokhintsev's "Principles of Quantum Mechanics" was published. This book made extremely detailed criticisms of the idealistic errors of Bohr, Heisenberg, and other idealistic scholars, and put forward his theory of quantum collectives (this book won the Stalin Prize in 1951). However, the above-mentioned erroneous viewpoints were still prevalent among some physicists in the Soviet Union, so in 1950 and 1951, criticisms of idealism in quantum mechanics were launched again in magazines such as "Advances in Physical Sciences" and "Problems of Philosophy," and were also related to the issue of how to establish the theory of "field" [Note 1]. This is a problem closely related to modern production and construction and of great theoretical significance. This discussion has not ended so far. This article intends to briefly introduce the situation of this discussion.
    ×　×　×
    From the many articles participating in the discussion, it can be clearly seen that there are two lines in the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics: one is the materialist line represented by Nikolsky, Blokhintsev, and others, who advocate the theory of quantum collectives; the other is the line represented by Bohr, Heisenberg, and others, who use the complementarity principle full of Machist spirit to distort the interpretation of quantum mechanics. These two opinions mainly focus on the following three issues.
    First, the issue of the object of study in quantum mechanics. From a materialist point of view, the object of study in quantum mechanics is quantum collectives. The laws of quantum mechanics are the laws of motion of quantum collectives. For individual particles, only indirect conclusions can be drawn, that is, conclusions about the probability of the particle [Note 2]. The theory of quantum mechanics can be compared extremely accurately with various experimental results. This theory predicts experimental results extremely accurately, and all these experiments are experiments of micro-particle collectives. It is enough to cite this fact: the state of a particle collective is described by a wave function, and the square of the absolute value of the wave function is the probability of this or that value of those physical quantities measured during the measurement. Therefore, in general, the concept of the motion of individual particles cannot be obtained. Quantum mechanics, in fact, cannot depict the movement of individual particles at all, but can only make conclusions about where the particle may be.
    However, according to the theory of Bohr and other "complementarity principles," a different understanding is made of the object of quantum mechanics. Contrary to the theory of collectives, it believes that quantum mechanics is the theory of individual activities, while at the same time believing that the individual activity process cannot be accurately described. Because quantum mechanics can only depict the results of macroscopic instruments measuring electrons. The electron is only measured at this moment, and measured again at another moment. Raising the question, that is, the question of what the electron is like between two measurements, is meaningless to us, because it is beyond our life experience. Quantum mechanics can only statistically explain the results of measurement, and the reason why this statistical nature occurs is due to the "uncontrollable interaction" of macroscopic instruments in the process of measuring electrons. From here, Bohr and others derived the concept that the law of causality does not exist. According to Bohr and others, due to the development of atomic physics, we must revise our concept of causality. Causality can only be applied to undisturbed systems. If this system is very small, then we cannot help but cause serious disturbances when observing it, and therefore, it is impossible to hope to find any causal connection from the results of observation. The law of causality is still applicable to undisturbed systems, and these equations can still be used to describe an undisturbed system, and a differential equation can be used to express the causal relationship between the state at this time and the state at another time. However, when we compare it with experiments, causality no longer exists due to the disturbance caused by observation, and can only be compared with indirect statistics and experiments. According to Heisenberg, it is either the depiction of time and space but the uncertainty principle; or the causal relationship expressed by mathematical formulas; however, the physical depiction in time and space becomes impossible. The two are alternately connected by statistical properties. The two are mutually "complementary" and mutually "exclusive" at the same time.
    Obviously, from the above-mentioned passage of the so-called "complementarity principle" on the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics, it can be seen that it is full of the spirit of philosophical agnosticism. From the point of view of the "complementarity principle," the object of study in quantum mechanics is not quantum collectives, the phenomena of micro-particles, but the results of observers, or the results of instrument measurements, rather than understanding the essence of micro-particles through instruments. Starting from the "complementarity principle," an artificial boundary is made for cognition, claiming that the nature or laws of motion of micro-particles are unknowable, supposedly due to the "uncontrollable interaction" of instruments with micro-particles (we will talk about the role of instruments and measurements below). In fact, the Schrödinger equation accurately describes the behavior of particle collectives and can be compared extremely accurately with experiments of particle collectives. For particle collectives, the law of causality is completely applicable.
    The "complementarity principle" first mistakes the object of study as individual particles, and then declares that the law of causality of individual particles does not exist during observation. In fact, we can only test the correctness of the law of change or causal law of particles from measurement. Bohr and others then announced the bankruptcy of the law of causality from here. This erroneous viewpoint is exactly what Lenin severely criticized in his book "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," those idealists attempt to melt the object into sensation or experience, regard scientific theory as organized experience, and declare the non-existence and unknowability of the laws of material movement. It obliterates the role of reason in recognizing objective things. Obviously, this is a Machist preaching, which distorts the essence of quantum mechanics and can only lead to hindering the development of science.
    The second issue in the discussion is the issue of the "uncertainty relation." The "uncertainty relation" is one of the important conclusions of modern science and has sufficient experimental basis. Various idealists and agnostics have placed high expectations on the "uncertainty relation," hoping to find the conclusions they hope to get here. However, in this discussion, this attempt was completely defeated. How to understand the uncertainty relation according to the theory of quantum collectives? First of all, it should be affirmed that the uncertainty relation is the result of the measurement of quantum collectives. For individual particles, only indirect conclusions can be drawn. If we measure the position of a certain micro-particle collective, and measure it ten thousand times, we can get ten thousand different values. An average value can be obtained from these values, and various differences can be obtained by subtracting the average value from each different value. The square root of the average of the squares of the differences can also be obtained, which is the △X used in the uncertainty relation. If we measure the momentum of the same micro-particle collective, we can also get the uncertainty △P in the same way, then we can get △P·△×Zh. In Blokhintsev's book, there is a precise mathematical proof of the correctness of the above relationship, and it proves that this is the result of the wave nature of particles.
    Conversely, Bohr and others start from a series of "hypothetical" experiments, and use "hypothetical" experiments to prove the uncertainty relation. Using "hypothetical" experiments to confirm the uncertainty relation is an extremely serious error in methodology. It is the most offensive way of modern idealism. Building physical theories on the basis of "hypothetical" experiments means that people build the foundation of physics from their own consciousness. Bohr and others completely deny here that practice is the criterion of truth, the basic principle of this famous dialectical materialism. Bohr and others imagined a set of experiments aimed at measuring single particles, used the laws of classical physics to imagine the interaction of particles, but in fact the interaction of particles does not obey the laws of classical physics. Bohr and others artificially added the "uncontrollable interaction" here, and erroneously derived the conclusion of the statistical nature of particles due to the uncontrollable effect during measurement. In order to prove the errors of Bohr and others, we can take the single-slit diffraction experiment listed in ordinary textbooks as an example. If it is considered that the uncertainty relation is aimed at individual electrons, it can be seen what contradictory results will be obtained. If a certain electron passes through a single slit and happens to fall in the center of the diffraction pattern on the back, then we have every right to assume that the momentum of the particle has not changed. However, for the width of the single slit, it can infinitely approach the minimum in principle, then at least for this one electron, isn't the uncertainty relation broken? (This experiment cannot be used to prove that particles can be measured accurately at the same time, but it can be used to prove the inaccuracy of Heisenberg's thesis.) Therefore, it can be seen from this experiment alone that the uncertainty relation has no meaning for individual particles. At most, it only makes some indirect conclusions from the uncertainty relation of particle collectives. From here, we can see how absurd the opinions of Bohr and others are, which deny the existence of causality due to the uncertainty relation of individual particles.
    The third issue touched upon in the discussion is the issue of the role of instruments. What should be the problem of the role of instruments studied from the principle of materialism? Regarding this point, Blokhintsev correctly wrote in his textbook "Principles of Quantum Mechanics": "From a materialist point of view, the possibility of cognition itself is premised on the existence of material connection between the subject of cognition and the object of study. In physics, this connection is realized with the help of various instruments. These instruments always affect the object, and conversely, the object also affects the instruments. Classical physics assumes that this interaction can make it arbitrarily small, but quantum physics has found that this effect cannot be made arbitrarily small. We have already seen that measuring instruments, in fact, change the state of the electronic system, thus turning one collective into another, but even so, it is absurd to link materialism with interactions that are infinitesimal in principle. The limitation of the interaction discovered in the field of quantum physics does not destroy materialism, nor does it add any boundaries to cognition. For example, when studying cosmic rays, counters or other instruments are used. These instruments change the state of individual particles appearing in the instrument, leading to new collectives, but for the entire quantum collective, or the collective we call cosmic rays, it has not changed. The changes introduced by these instruments to the entire process of cosmic ray phenomena are extremely small, so they do not disturb our understanding of the objective laws and characteristics of cosmic rays at all. Therefore, what quantum mechanics actually studies is the objective essence of quantum collectives, which exists independently of the observer."
    Starting from the theory of the "complementarity principle," instruments will be incorrectly given too high a role. It is believed that the state of the quantum collective is determined by the measurement of the instrument, and depends on the instrument. It even believes that the object of study in quantum mechanics is the deflection of the galvanometer pointer, the degree of expansion of the gold leaf of the electroscope, etc. It will believe that the statistical properties of particles are due to the uncontrollable interaction of the instrument with the particles. In fact, it is enough to cite some facts to prove the absurdity of these arguments. For example, the natural radioactive phenomenon existing in nature, such as the radioactive phenomenon of β-rays of uranium, is completely a statistical phenomenon, and these statistical phenomena do not depend on any instrument at all. This phenomenon has been going on for hundreds of millions of years. The statistical experiments applied in modern research on cosmic rays can show that cosmic rays are also completely statistical collectives that do not depend on instruments. The idea that quantum mechanics is the study of the interaction between instruments and micro-particles, which is advocated by the propagandists of the "complementarity principle," is exactly the same as Avenarius's doctrine of "principal coordination" [Note 3]. The only difference is that the subject in Avenarius's theory is replaced by the instrument here, and the object in Avenarius's theory is replaced by micro-particles. In this way, Bohr obliterates the issue of the nature of micro-particles, and attributes the state of particles to the category of instruments, which is fundamentally wrong.
    The situation of Soviet scientists and philosophers criticizing the "complementarity principle" is roughly like this. There are many other issues involved, which will not be introduced here one by one.
          ×　×　×
    We now have to ask: What is the significance of such critical work for further developing quantum theory?
    First of all, preliminary conclusions have been reached on the issue of the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. We know that there are various kinds of opinions surrounding the issue of the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics. Some attempt to reduce particles to waves, while others attempt to reduce waves to particles, and some simply evade this issue, refusing to make any answer to the nature of micro-particles, believing that quantum mechanics only studies the results of observers. People who are new to modern physics have this experience: whenever they learn about the "uncertainty relation," wave and particle, and other issues, they cannot help but feel great difficulty and ideological confusion. Here, the theory of quantum collectives proposed by Soviet scientists confirms that the object of quantum mechanics is the collective of micro-particles, which clarifies the confused thinking in this area to a great extent, thus clearing ideological obstacles for the further development of quantum theory.
    Secondly, after confirming that the object of study in quantum mechanics is the micro-particle collective, the question is raised: what are the laws of motion of individual micro-particles? Obviously, if starting from the "complementarity principle," such a question cannot be raised at all. Bohr and others completely obliterated this question in the discussion of the so-called "hidden variables," while according to the theory of quantum collectives, such a question is naturally raised, stimulating us to open up a new field, that is, the issue of the theory of non-statistical properties of micro-particles. From here, we can see that the reactionary role of the "complementarity principle" lies in hindering us from raising such questions, while the progressive role of the theory of quantum collectives lies in raising a new question. The issue of how to establish the theory of non-statistical properties of micro-particles, or the theory of micro-particle fields, has been raised by Soviet scientists and is beginning to unfold a wide-ranging discussion.
    What is the significance of the work of Soviet scientists criticizing idealism in quantum mechanics for Chinese scientists, and what lessons should be learned from it? First of all, it once again shows the guiding role of dialectical materialism. Once again, it powerfully criticizes the thinking of some scientific workers who despise philosophy, despise the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism for scientific work, or believe that Marxism-Leninism can only play a role in biological sciences and social sciences, while it has no guiding role for other sciences such as physics. This once again illustrates how necessary the close connection between natural scientists and philosophers is, and how necessary it is for scientists to study Marxism-Leninism! Regarding this point, Lenin specially pointed out in his book "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism" that the materialism of most natural scientists is usually spontaneous, unconscious, and not elevated to philosophical materialism, and the unconsciousness and spontaneity of the naturally generated materialism of these scholars make them unable to fight against metaphysics and idealistic philosophy, thus creating a crisis in physics. Lenin clearly demonstrated that only by arming oneself with dialectical materialism can one get rid of the status quo. Obviously, the work of Soviet scientists criticizing idealism in quantum mechanics embodies Lenin's instruction.
    Secondly, lessons should be learned from the critical work on idealism in quantum mechanics to further carry out the critical work on idealism in physics. We know that idealism has penetrated physics in various forms, and Machism has a direct origin and connection with physics. Lenin clearly pointed out that the reason why idealism penetrates physics is, first of all, the mathematization of theoretical physics (here refers to the mathematization of physics, not to say that physics does not need to use mathematics - the author), thus generating the mathematician's forgetting of matter, and concluding that "matter has disappeared," leaving only equations. Another reason is relativism, that is, the theory about the relativity of human knowledge. Relativism, in the absence of understanding dialectics, inevitably leads to idealism. Lenin's opinions are worth considering repeatedly by Chinese physicists. It is undeniable that some physicists in China have had a profound influence of Machism. Some theoretical workers also do more formal calculations when conducting theoretical research, and fewer really analyze the facts of experiments. Some theoretical workers even give a certain degree of contempt to the work of semi-empirical formulas. This practice violates the basic principle of starting from the facts. It can be seen from this criticism of quantum mechanics and the discussion of the establishment of the theory of "field" that there are two characteristics. One is the unusual emphasis on the guiding role of materialistic dialectics and the criticism of erroneous theories, and the other is the unusual emphasis on the analysis of experimental facts, attempting to establish correct physical concepts from these two, thereby promoting the development of physics. These characteristics of the research work of Soviet scientists are all worth considering and adopting.
    Finally, it should be pointed out that the vulgar bystander's objectivism attitude should be opposed. First of all, it shows an indifferent attitude towards this debate, or treats the struggle between idealism and materialism in physics as different opinions of two schools, which are only for reference, and do not intend to draw conclusions from the debate. This is a conciliatory attitude towards the party struggle on philosophy. This essentially obliterates the existence of objective truth, believing that there can be many kinds of truth, and swimming back and forth between various truths. This "objective" attitude, named objective, is not truly objective in essence, and does not truly test the correctness of the theory according to the facts.
    All people's scientists and advanced scientific workers should strive to further criticize idealism in physics and to build a physical science guided by dialectical materialism.
    [Note 1] The theory of "field" is an attempt by modern physicists, attempting to solve the theoretical problems of elementary particles and the relationship between relativity and quantum mechanics in this theory.
    [Note 2] Probability is sometimes translated as probability, but it is currently translated as probability.
    [Note 3] Avenarius's theory of principal congruence is a subjective idealism. This theory believes that it is not necessary to try to understand the subject and the object separately, but to understand the original thing that was later decomposed into these two, that is, the subject-object and the object-subject thing.

    苏联科学界批判量子力学中的唯心论观点
    何祚庥
    列宁在他的著名的著作“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中，就指出了存在于物理学中的危机。这个物理学的危机也同样极为严重地表现在量子力学当中。近来年，西方资产阶级学者以波尔、海森堡为首，创导着所谓“互补原理”，以唯心论的解说歪曲了量子力学的实质，甚而至于宣称这个“互补原理”也同样地适用于生物的、心理的以及社会的规律，这个情况诚如日丹诺夫同志在他的著名的“在讨论亚历山大洛夫‘西欧哲学史’一书讨论会上的发言”所指出：“现代资产阶级科学供给宗教和神学以新的论证，这是必须无情揭破的。……同样，现代资产阶级原子物理学家所具有的康德主义的怪想，使他们得出什么电子具有‘自由意志’的结论，使他们企图把物质描写成为只有一些电波总和等等鬼话。”显然，这种荒谬的意见不能不遭遇到苏联科学家的反对，和无情的批判。特别是联共中央发布了关于文学、艺术诸问题的决议以后，更大大地推进了这种批判的工作。像其他科学部门中批判唯心论的工作一样（如关于摩尔根·魏斯曼的旧生物学的批判，关于巴甫洛夫学说的会议，关于天体演化学的会议，以及在化学中关于“共振学说”的批判等），反对物理学中的各种各样的唯心论，也正是这一系列反对各种各样的唯心论伪科学的理论的一个环节。
    远在一九四零年以前，苏联科学家尼考耳斯基便已经对量子力学中的唯心论做了某些批判，并且提出了他自己的量子集团的理论。直到一九四七年，日丹诺夫同志批评了哲学战线上的现状以后，便在一九四七、一九四八年的“哲学问题”杂志上展开了对量子力学的批判工作，特别详尽地讨论了马尔科夫的“论物理知识的性质”一文的错误，在一九四八年的第三期上，则由编辑部做了一个总结。这次讨论除纠正了马尔科夫的错误以外，还粉碎了所谓
    “互补原理”的唯心论的基础。一九四九年布洛欣采夫所著的量子力学原理出版，该书对于波尔、海森堡等唯心学者的唯心论错误做了极为详尽的批判，并且提出了他的量子集团的理论（此书获得了一九五一年的斯大林奖金）。可是上述的错误观点尚在苏联的部分物理学者中流行，于是在一九五零、一九五一年又在“物理科学的成就”、“哲学问题”等杂志上，展开了对量子力学中的唯心论的批判工作。并且联带讨论到如何建立“场”的理论的问题〔注一〕，这是一个和近代的生产建设有密切关系、并且具有重大理论意义的问题，这个讨论直到现在为止，还没有结束。本文打算把这次讨论的情况简单地介绍一下。
    ×　×　×
    从参加讨论的许多文章中，可以清楚地看出：在量子力学的物理的解释上，存在着两条路线：一条是以尼考耳斯基、布洛欣采夫等为代表的、主张量子集团理论的唯物主义的路线，另一条是以波尔、海森堡等为代表的、用充满了马赫主义精神的互补原理来对量子力学做歪曲的解释的路线。这两种意见主要集中在下面三个问题上。
    首先便是量子力学研究的对象问题。从唯物主义的观点看来，量子力学研究的对象是量子集团。量子力学的规律是量子集团的运动的规律。对于个别粒子来说，只能做出间接的结论，即关于该粒子的几率〔注二〕底结论。量子力学的理论可以和各种实验结果作极为精确的比较，这种理论极为精确地预见了实验的结果，而这些实验无一不是微粒子集团的实验。只要举出这一事实便够了，粒子集团的状态是用波动函数来描述的，而波动函数绝对值的平方便是在测量时那些被测量的物理数量的这种或那种数值的几率。因而在一般情形下得不出关于个体质点的运动的概念。量子力学在事实上完全不能描绘个别粒子的运动状况，而只能做出该粒子可能在什么地方的结论。
    可是，根据波尔等“互补原理”的理论，却对于量子力学的对象做了另一种的理解。它和集团理论相反，认为量子力学是研究个体活动的理论，而同时又认为个体的活动过程是不能精确地描绘的。因为量子力学只能描绘着宏观的仪器对于电子的度量的结果，电子只是在这一瞬间被度量着，在另一瞬间又被度量着。提出这样的问题，即电子在两次度量之间是什么状况的问题，对于我们来说，是没有意义的，因为那是超乎我们的生活经验以外的事。量子力学只能统计地说明度量的结果，而这种统计性之所以发生，则是由于宏观的仪器对于电子的度量过程的“无法控制的相互作用”。波尔等便从这里出发，又得出了因果律不存在的概念。按照波尔等的说法，由于原子物理学的发展，必须修改我们关于因果律的概念，因果律只能适用于不扰动的系统。如果这个系统很小，那末我们在观察它时便不能不发生严重的扰动，因此，便不可能希图从观察的结果中去找出任何因果的联系。因果律对于不扰乱的系统来说还是适用的，而这些方程式还是可以用来描绘一个未曾扰乱的系统的，而且可以用一个微分方程来表示此一时间的状况和另一时间的状况之间的因果关系。不过当我们和实验相比较时，则由于观察所引起的扰乱，因果律便不再存在，而只能间接的统计的和实验相比较，按照海森堡的话说，或者是时间和空间的描绘但是测不准原理；或者是数学公式表现的因果关系；但是，时间空间中的物理的描绘成为不可能。这两者是交替的为统计性所联系的。这两者是互相“补充”，同时又互相“排斥”的。
    很显然，从上述的一段所谓“互补原理”所论述的关于对量子力学的物理解说中，可以看出它是充满了哲学上的不可知论的精神的。从“互补原理”看来，量子力学研究的对象，不是量子集团、微粒子的现象。而是观察者的结果，或者是仪器测量的结果。而不是通过仪器去认识微粒子的本质。从
    “互补原理”出发，人为地给认识做了一个界限，宣称微粒子的本性或运动规律是不可知的，据说是由于仪器对于微粒子“不可控制的相互作用”的结果（关于仪器及测量的作用我们在下面还要谈到）。事实上，史列丁格尔方程式，极为精确地描写了粒子集团的行动，可以和粒子集团的实验极为精确的相比较，对粒子集团来说，因果律是完全适用的。
    “互补原理”首先把研究对象误做个别的粒子，然后又宣称个别粒子的因果律，在观察时不存在，事实上，我们只有从度量中来检验粒子的变化规律或因果规律的正确性，波尔等便从这里而宣布了因果律的破产。这种错误的观点恰恰是列宁在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中所严厉批评的，那些唯心论者企图把客体融化到感觉或经验当中去，把科学的理论当作有组织的经验，而宣称物质运动规律的不存在和不可认识。抹杀了理性在认识客观事物的作用。很显然这是一种马赫主义的说教，歪曲了量子力学的实质，而只能引导到阻碍科学的发展。
    讨论中的第二个问题便是“测不准关系”的问题。“测不准关系”是近代科学重要结论之一，是有着充分的实验根据的。各种唯心论者、不可知论者曾对“测不准关系”寄予很高的期望，希望在这里找到他们所希望得到的结论。可是在这次讨论中，这种企图遭到了完全的失败。按照量子集团的理论是怎样来了解测不准关系呢？首先应该肯定的是，测不准关系是对量子集团的测量的结果，对于个别粒子来说，只能做出间接结论。我们如果对某一微粒子集团做位置的测量。量了一万次，可以得到一万次的不同数值。从这些数值中可以求出一个平均值，从各不同数值减去平均值可以得到各种差额。又可以求出各差额的平方平均值的平方根，这就是测不准关系中所用的△X。如果对同一微粒子集团做动量的测量，按照同样的方法也可以得到不确定△P，那末便可以得到△P·△×Zh。在布洛欣采夫书上曾有精确的数学证明了上述的关系的正确性，并证明了这是由于粒子的波动性的结果。
    相反地，波尔等从一系列的“假想”的实验出发，从“假想”的实验来证明测不准关系。用“假想”的实验来证实测不准关系，这在方法论上是一个极为严重的错误。是近代的唯心论最带有进攻性质的方式。在“假想”的实验的基础上来建造物理理论，就是说人从自己的意识中来建造物理学的基础。波尔等在这里完全否认实践是真理的标准，这一著名的辩证唯物论的基本原理。波尔等假想了以测定单个的粒子为目的的一套实验，用了古典物理学的规律来想像粒子底相互作用，而在实际上粒子的相互作用并不服从古典物理学的规律。波尔等就在这里人为地加进了“不可控制的相互作用”，错误地得出了由于测量时的不可控制的作用而得出的粒子统计性质的结论。为了证明波尔等的错误，可以拿通常教科书上所列举的单缝衍射的实验为例。如果认为测不准关系是以个体的电子为对象的话，可以看出，这会得到何等矛盾的结果。如果有某一电子通过单缝而恰巧落在背面的衍射花样的中央，那末我们就完全有权假定，该粒子的动量是没有变化的。可是对单缝的宽度来说，在原则上可以无限地趋近于极小，那末至少对这一粒电子来说，岂不是测不准关系就被破坏了么？（这个实验并不是可以用来证明粒子可以同时测准，但可以用来证明海森堡底论断的不正确。）所以，仅从这一实验就可以看出对个别粒子而言测不准关系，是没有什么意义的，最多只是间接地从粒子集团的测不准关系中做出若干间接的结论。从这里便可以看出波尔等所设想的由于个别粒子的测不准关系而引起否认因果律的存在等等意见是何等的荒谬了。
    讨论中接触到的第三个问题是关于仪器的作用的问题。从唯物主义原理出发来研讨的关于仪器的作用的问题，应该是怎样的呢？关于这一点布洛欣采夫在他的量子力学原理的教科书中正确地写道：“从唯物主义的观点来看，认识的可能性本身，就是以认识的主体与研究的客体之间的物质联系之存在，为其先决条件的。在物理中，这种联系借着各种仪器的帮助而实现。这些仪器永远影响着客体，相反地，客体也影响着仪器。古典物理学中假定这种相互影响可以使它成为任意小，但在量子物理中却发现了这种影响是不能够使之成为任意小的。我们已经看见过，测量仪器事实上改变电子系统的状态，因而把一个集团变成了另一个，可是虽然如此，如果把唯物论与原则上极微小的相互作用连在一起，那也是荒谬的。在量子物理领域里所发现的相互作用的有限性，并不破坏唯物论，也不为认识上加上任何界限。例如，当研究宇宙射线时，应用计数器或者别的仪器。这些仪器改变了出现在仪器中的个别粒子的状态，引导到新的集团，但是对于整个的量子集团来说，或者我们叫做宇宙射线的集团的，则并没有改变。这些仪器对于宇宙射线现象的整个过程所引进的改变是极微小的，因而一点也不扰乱我们对于宇宙射线的客观规律、特征的理解。因此量子力学事实上所研究的是量子集团底客观的，不受观察者的影响而存在的本质。”
    从“互补原理”的理论出发，便会不正确地赋予仪器以过高的作用。便是认为量子集团底状态是由仪器的测量来决定的，是依存于仪器的。甚而至于认为量子力学研究的对象就是电流计指针的偏转，静电仪的金箔张开的程度等等便会认为粒子的统计性质是由于仪器对于粒子的不可控制的相互作用。其实只要举出一些事实便足以证实这些论点的荒谬了。例如存在于大自然界的天然的放射现象，例如铀的β射线的放射的现象，完全是一种统计的现象，而这些统计现象完全不依存于什么仪器，这种现象已然进行了好几万万年。近代研究宇宙线所应用的统计的实验，可以看出宇宙射线也完全是不依存于仪器的统计的集团。“互补原理”的宣传者所宣扬的量子力学是研究仪器和微粒子相互作用这一思想，恰恰和阿万纳留斯所宣扬的“原则同格”的学说〔注三〕如出一辙，只不过阿万纳留斯那里的主体，在这里被换成为仪器，阿万纳留斯的客体被换为微粒子而已。这样，波尔就抹杀了微粒子的本性的问题，把粒子的状态归之于仪器的范畴，而这在原则上是错误的。
    关于苏联科学家及哲学家批判“互补原理”的情况，大致如此，其他问题涉及的还很多，这里就不一一介绍了。

    我们现在要问：这样的批判工作对于进一步发展量子理论有什么意义呢？
    首先，便是对于量子力学的物理的解释的问题得到了初步的结论。我们知道，围绕着量子力学的物理的解释的问题上有着各式各种的见解。有的企图把粒子还原为波，而有的则企图把波还原为粒子，有的则根本逃避这个问题，拒绝对微粒子的本性做任何回答，认为量子力学只是研究观察者的结果。初学近代物理的人，都有这样的经验，凡是学到“测不准关系”，波动和粒子等等问题的时候，没有不感到很大的困难和思想上的混乱的。在这里，苏联科学家所提出的量子集团的理论确认了量子力学的对象是微粒子的集团，便在极大程度上澄清了这方面的混乱思想，因而为量子理论的进一步的发展廓清了思想上的障碍。
    其次，在确认了量子力学的研究对象是微粒子集团以后，便提出了这样的问题，微粒子个体的运动规律是怎样的问题。很显然，若从“互补原理”出发，则根本提不出这样的问题，波尔等在所谓“隐藏的变数”这一问题的讨论中，根本抹杀了这个问题，而根据量子集团的理论，则自然而然地提出了这样的问题，刺激了我们去开辟一个新的领域，即微粒子非统计性的理论的问题。从这里便可以看出“互补原理”的反动作用便在于阻碍我们提出这样的问题，而量子集团理论的进步作用，便在于提出了一个新的问题。关于如何建立微粒子非统计性的理论问题，或者微粒场的理论问题，已由苏联科学家提出，正在开始展开广泛的讨论。
    苏联科学家批判量子力学唯心论的工作，对于我国科学家来说，具有什么样的意义呢，应该从这里吸取什么样的教训呢？首先便在于它再一次显示了辩证唯物主义的指导作用。再一次地有力地批判了某些科学工作者轻视哲学，轻视马克思、列宁主义的对科学工作的指导作用的思想，或者是认为马克思、列宁主义只能对生物科学、社会科学有作用，而对于其他科学如物理学等则没有什么指导作用的有害思想。这就再一次地说明了，自然科学家和哲学家的密切联系是何等必要，科学家学习马克思、列宁主义，是何等必要！关于这一点，列宁曾在“唯物论与经验批判论”一书中特别指出，大部分的自然科学家底唯物论，照例总是自发的、不自觉的、没有提高到哲学的唯物论，而这些学者的自然产生的唯物论的不自觉性和自发性，使得他们没有力量和形而上学作斗争，和唯心论哲学作斗争，由此产生了物理学的危机。列宁极为清楚地论证了，只有用辩证唯物主义武装起来，才是摆脱现状的惟一出路。很显然，苏联科学家批判量子力学中唯心论的工作，正是体现了列宁的这一指示。
    其次，应该从关于量子力学的唯心论的批判工作中吸取教训，进一步开展物理学中的唯心论的批判工作。我们知道，唯心论曾经以各种各样的形式渗透在物理学中，而马赫主义更是和物理学有着直接的渊源和联系。列宁曾极为清楚地指出，唯心论渗入物理学的原因，首先是理论物理学的数学化（这里指的是物理的数学化，不是说物理学不要用数学了——作者），因而产生了数学家对于物质的遗忘，得出了“物质消灭了”，只剩下方程式了的结论。另一原因，是相对主义，即关于人类知识底相对性的学说。相对论在不理解辩证法的情形下，是不可避免地会引导到唯心论。列宁这些意见是值得我国的物理学家再三考虑的。不可否认的是：我国有一些物理学家曾经有过马赫主义的深厚影响。有一些理论工作者，进行理论研究时，也是数学的形式的演算多而真正分析实验的事实来进行研究的则不多。有些理论工作者更对于半经验的公式的工作予以某种程度上的轻视。这种做法是违反了从事实出发这一基本原理的。仅仅从这次对量子力学的批判工作中，以及“场”的理论的建立的讨论中，可以看出有两个特点。其一是异常重视唯物辩证法的指导作用，以及对错误理论的批判，另一是异常重视实验事实的分析，企图从这两者来建立正确的物理概念，从而推动物理的发展。苏联科学家研究工作中的这些特点都是值得我们考虑采纳的。
    最后，应该提出的是：应该反对那种庸俗的旁观的客观主义的态度。首先是对这种争论表现了漠不关心的态度，或者是把物理学中唯心论和唯物论的斗争当作两种学派的意见不同，仅仅可供参考，不打算从争论中做出结论来。这就是对哲学上的党派斗争采取了调和的态度。这在实质上是抹杀了客观真理的存在，认为真理可以有好多种，而在各种真理之间游来游去。这种“客观”主义的态度，名为客观，实质上并不真正客观，并不是真正按照事实来检验理论的正确性。
    一切的人民科学家，先进的科学工作者，应该为进一步批判物理学中的唯心主义，为建设辩证唯物主义指导的物理科学而奋斗。
    〔注一〕“场”的理论是近代的物理学家的一种企图，企图站在这个理论中解决基本粒子的理论问题以及相对论和量子力学的关系的问题等等。
    〔注二〕几率即或然率，有时译做盖然性，而目前均译作几率。
    〔注三〕阿万纳留斯的原则同格学说是一种主观唯心论。这种学说认为不要企图各别地去理解主体和客体，而要理解后来才分解为这两者的原来的东西，那就是主体的——客体的和客体的——主体的东西。
