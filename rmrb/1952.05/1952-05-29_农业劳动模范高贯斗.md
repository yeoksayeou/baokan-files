    IV. Gao Guandou is not only a labor expert, but also an outstanding propagandist. Every dusk, when everyone was resting, he would gather the people of the whole village and use his talent for storytelling to tell a story and talk about the benefits of mutual aid teams. As a result, eleven mutual aid teams were developed in one year, organizing thirty-seven households.
    V. In order to consolidate and improve the production enthusiasm of the mutual aid team members, Gao Guandou created a method of recording work based on clean labor: within the team, everyone evaluates the work and determines the work value. Each labor is calculated according to the amount of work value with bamboo sticks. There are two types of bamboo sticks, full work and half work. At the end of the work, the wages are settled according to the obtained bamboo sticks; everyone feels that this is very fair. Therefore, the mutual aid team has developed day by day. Now more than 80% of the households in the village have joined the mutual aid team.
    VI. Improving saline-alkali land and improving production technology are the most urgent requirements of the farmers of Dahu Jia Village. In 1945, Gao Guandou participated in the production conference in the Jizhong District and absorbed the production experience of various places. After returning to the village, he organized elderly farmers to form a production research group to study ways to improve production technology.

    四、高贯斗不仅是个劳动能手，也是个杰出的宣传员。每当黄昏，大家正在休息的时候，他就把全村的人召集起来，利用他说评书的特长，说一段故事，讲一会互助组的好处。这样一来，一年就发展了十一个互助组，把三十七户组织起来了。
    五、为了巩固和提高互助组成员的生产情绪，高贯斗创造了清工记工的办法：在组内由大家评工、评定工值，每次劳动都按工值的多少以竹签计算。竹签有全工和半工两种，到工作结束时，以所得的竹签来结算工资；大家都觉得这很公道。因此互助组也就一天一天地发展起来。现在全村百分之八十以上的户都参加了互助组。
    六、改良碱地，提高生产技术，是大护驾庄农民最迫切的要求。一九四五年，高贯斗参加冀中区生产会议，吸取了各地的生产经验。他回村后组织老年农民成立了生产研究组，研究改进生产技术的办法。
