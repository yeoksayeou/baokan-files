    Boshan City, Shandong Province, Should Thoroughly Correct the Phenomenon of Cadres Not Paying Attention to Reading Newspapers
    Comrade Editor: The phenomenon of some cadres in Boshan City, Shandong Province, not paying attention to reading newspapers has improved since the "Three-Anti" movement, but the improvement is still not significant.
    Before the "Three-Anti" movement, many staff members in Boshan City, especially engineers and technicians in factories and mines, had the erroneous idea of "emphasizing professional work and neglecting politics." For example, some engineers and laboratory technicians at Shandong Ceramics Factory once said, "It won't do if professional work isn't done well, but it doesn't matter if politics isn't studied well."
    After the "Three-Anti" movement, most comrades began to realize that this idea was wrong and began to pay attention to reading newspapers. However, some people still haven't changed much to this day.
    Regarding the above situation, I suggest that the local Party organizations and government organs quickly find ways to correct it.

    山东博山市应彻底纠正干部不注意读报的现象
    编辑同志：山东省博山市某些机关干部不注意读报的现象，在“三反”运动以后虽有改进，但改进的还不多。
    “三反”运动以前，博山市的许多机关工作人员，特别是厂、矿的工程师和技术人员中有“重业务，轻政治”的错误思想。如山东窑业厂的某些工程师和化验技术人员曾说：“业务工作搞不好不成，政治学不好没关系。”
    “三反”运动以后，大部分同志开始认识到这种思想是错误的，也开始注意阅读报纸了。但还有一部分人至今仍没有什么改变。
    对以上情况，我建议当地党的组织和政府机关，赶快想法纠正。
