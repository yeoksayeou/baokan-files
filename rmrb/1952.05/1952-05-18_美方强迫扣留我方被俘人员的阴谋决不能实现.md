Title: The U.S. Scheme to Forcibly Detain Our Captured Personnel Must Never Succeed

The American aggressors' crime of forcibly detaining our captured personnel, like all their bloody crimes, cannot be denied by any sophistry.

Following the heroic struggle of our captured personnel on Koje Island against the U.S. side's forced "screening" and for reasonable treatment and the right to return to their homeland, the American aggressors, on the one hand, showed extreme embarrassment because their conspiracy had been completely exposed; on the other hand, they continued to intensify their retaliation and persecution of our captured personnel. The ironclad evidence of the U.S. side's forced detention of our captured personnel is now increasing day by day. Based on this evidence, the people of the world should become more determined to sanction the escalating crimes of the American aggressors.

The confession of Wang Jiati, an American-captured special agent, is another ironclad proof of the U.S. side's forced detention of our captured personnel. This special agent of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who served as principal, section chief, and secretary in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Koje Island, confessed that the crimes of forcibly tattooing and writing blood letters on our captured personnel were carried out under the personal inspection of the former commander-in-chief of the U.S. invading army, Ridgway. This is another thorough exposure of the U.S. side's shameless lie that they have "always treated prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Convention" after the Koje Island incident occurred.

The U.S. side is now continuing to take persecution measures against our captured personnel on Koje Island that are in complete violation of the Geneva Convention. An Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 15th revealed that the new commander of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, Bonner, is "strengthening security measures," and even when news reporters were visiting Bonner, they "heard two gunshots in the distance, followed by three more shots," which were said to be prisoners escaping and being "hit." An Associated Press dispatch from Busan on the 14th had already stated that "a new control agency has been established on Koje Island," and that "control is even stricter." This is enough to show that the U.S. side's so-called "treatment of prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Convention" is completely a lie. The U.S. side has even completely torn up its own written promises to our captured personnel.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th, a statement by the new commander-in-chief of the U.S. invading army, Clark, shamelessly overturned all the promises originally made by the U.S. Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp负责人负责人, Colson, to our captured personnel. Clark said that Colson's promises "had no effect whatsoever" because they were made under circumstances where the life of an American "officer was under actual threat," and Colson was considered to be "unauthorized to accept the Communist demands." However, everyone knows that the American "officer," Dodd, in his statement issued in Seoul on the 12th, repeatedly said that "throughout my stay in the camp, I was treated with utmost respect and courtesy, and my personal needs were well taken care of," "all prisoner-of-war camp representatives attended the meeting and discussed the prisoners' suffering for three hours. The meeting was conducted according to the best parliamentary procedure," and "the question of whether my response was satisfactory was put to a vote," and "the rulings were all very fair to me." This is completely contrary to what Clark said about the situation where the life of this "officer was under actual threat." Similarly, everyone also knows that when Colson accompanied U.S. Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet to Koje Island to "rescue the kidnapped U.S. Brigadier General Dodd," according to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 10th: "Van Fleet said: This prisoner-of-war camp is now under the direct control of General Colson, and he has full authority to handle this situation." This is also completely contrary to what Clark said about Colson being "unauthorized to accept the Communist demands."

The facts are very clear that the actions of those "officers" of the United States are inseparable from the instructions of the U.S. military headquarters and the U.S. Department of Defense. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 15th, a spokesman for the U.S. Eighth Army explained Van Fleet's attitude toward Koje Island and the prisoner-of-war issue: "The Eighth Army is only carrying out the screening work according to the orders of the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations forces," and "all administrative affairs are carried out according to the instructions of the higher headquarters." That is to say, they could not act outside the instructions of the highest command of the United States. The fact that the aforementioned Chiang bandit special agent Wang Jiati confessed that Ridgway personally inspected the forced "screening" on Koje Island, and the fact that Van Fleet and his ilk were ordered to carry out "screening," etc., all prove this point. Therefore, the promises made by Colson, etc., are obviously promises made by the U.S. invading army headquarters and the U.S. Department of Defense. The insidious and cunning American aggressors simply refuse to abandon their scheme to forcibly detain our captured personnel. Therefore, they went back on their word, making promises and then tearing them up. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 14th revealed that "Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp commander Brigadier General Colson was removed from his post as a result of a special three-hour consultation between senior Pentagon officials and General Clark via teletype," because they were afraid of "losing face" afterward. This is the inside story of all the conspiracies played by the American Pentagon.

Now, we must once again warn the American aggressors: no matter what conspiracies you play, they will inevitably be thoroughly exposed one by one. Every time you play a conspiracy, you add another layer of guilt. We have already obtained a large amount of your evidence of crimes. It is impossible for you to forcibly detain our captured personnel. We must continue to thoroughly smash your last obstacle in the Korean armistice negotiations—the so-called "voluntary repatriation" and forced "screening" of prisoners of war—and realize the just demands we put forward on May 2.

### 美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋决不能实现

    美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋决不能实现
    美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪行，和它的一切血腥罪行一样，是任何狡辩所抵赖不了的。
    在巨济岛上我方被俘人员为反对美方强迫“甄别”、争取合理待遇和重返祖国的权利而进行了英勇的斗争之后，美国侵略者一方面因阴谋已彻底败露而表现了狼狈不堪；另一方面又还继续对我方被俘人员加紧报复迫害。美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的铁一般的罪证，现在正一天天地继续增加。根据这些罪证，全世界人民都应该更坚决起来，制裁美国侵略者日益变本加厉的罪行。
    我方捕获的美方特务王家悌的供状，是美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的又一铁证。这个在巨济岛美方俘虏营充当过校长、股长、秘书等职务的蒋介石匪帮的特务，供认了他们对我被俘人员强迫实行刺字、写血书等的罪行是在美国侵略军前任总司令李奇微亲自检查下进行的。这对于美方在巨济岛事件发生后所狡辩的“一直按照日内瓦公约对待俘虏”的无耻谎言，又是一个彻底的揭露。
    美方对于巨济岛的我方被俘人员，现在正继续采取着完全违反日内瓦公约的迫害行为。美联社巨济岛十五日的电讯透露：美方新任巨济岛战俘营长官波纳正在“加强治安措施”，甚至就在新闻记者访问波纳的时候，就“听到远处传来枪声两响，接着又听到放了三枪”，据说是俘虏逃跑，被“打中了”。美联社釜山十四日电讯中早已说到“巨济岛上成立了新的管制机构”，“管制更加严紧”。这就很够说明美方所谓“按照日内瓦公约对待俘虏”完全是撒谎。美方甚至于把他们自己对我方被俘人员所作的书面诺言也完全撕毁了。
    据美联社东京十五日电讯公布，新任美国侵略军总司令克拉克的声明，竟然无耻地推翻了原来美方巨济岛俘虏营负责人柯尔生对我方被俘人员的一切诺言。克拉克说柯尔生的诺言“没有丝毫效力”，其理由是这诺言产生于美国“一位军官的生命受实际威胁”的情况之下，而柯尔生则被认为是“无权擅自接受共产党的要求”的。但是，谁都知道美国的那“一位军官”杜德十二日在汉城发表的声明中，曾再三地说到“在我住在营场的整个期间，我受到极为尊重和有礼貌的待遇，我个人的需要受到很大的照顾”，“所有俘虏营场代表都出席会议，对俘虏们的痛苦讨论了三个小时。这次会议是按照最好的议事程序进行的”，“我的答复是否满意的问题付诸表决”，“裁决都是对我很公正的”。这和克拉克所说的这“一位军官的生命受实际威胁”的情况恰恰是完全相反的。同样，谁也知道，当柯尔生随同美国第八军军长范佛里特到巨济岛去“营救被劫持的美国准将杜德”的时候，据美联社汉城十日电讯称：“范佛里特说：这个战俘营现在归柯尔生将军直接掌管，他有处理这种局面的全权。”这和克拉克所说的柯尔生“无权擅自接受共产党的要求”等语又恰恰是完全相反的。
    事实非常清楚，美国的不管那“一位军官”的这些行为都是和美军总部及美国国防部的指使分不开的。据美联社汉城十五日电，美国第八军的一位发言人解释范佛里特对巨济岛和战俘问题的态度时称：“第八军仅是按照着联合国军总司令的命令，进行甄别工作”，“一切行政事务都是按照上级司令部的指示进行的”。这就是说，他们不可能在美国的最高指挥机关的指示以外去行事的。上述蒋匪特务王家悌供认李奇微亲自检查巨济岛强迫“甄别”的事实，和这里所举的范佛里特之流受命进行“甄别”等等，都证明了这个问题。因此，柯尔生等所作的诺言显然就是美国侵略军总部和美国国防部所作的诺言。阴险狡诈的美国侵略者只是因为不肯放弃他们强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，因此，出尔反尔，作了诺言而又加以撕毁。合众社华盛顿十四日电讯曾透露：“巨济岛俘虏营长官柯尔生准将被撤职，是五角大楼高级官员与克拉克将军经由打字电报机特别商谈三小时的结果”，因为他们事后又害怕“丢脸”。这就是美国五角大楼所玩弄的全部阴谋的内幕。
    现在，我们必须再一次警告美国侵略者；不管你们耍弄任何阴谋，都不可避免地要一一被彻底揭穿。你们多耍弄一次阴谋就加重了一层罪恶。我们已经把你们的大批罪证都拿在手里了，你们要想强迫扣留我方被俘人员是决不可能的，我们一定要继续彻底粉碎你们在朝鲜停战谈判中所摆下的最后一个障碍——对战俘的所谓“自愿遣返”和强迫“甄别”的阴谋，并实现我方五月二日所提出的公正主张。
