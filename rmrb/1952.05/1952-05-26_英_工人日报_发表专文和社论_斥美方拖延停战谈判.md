Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 23rd. The London "Workers' Daily" published a series of articles and photos on the 17th, denouncing the atrocities of the American aggressors in forcibly detaining and abusing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

Under the banner headline "American troops shoot prisoners - Washington and Whitehall dare not publish these facts," the "Workers' Daily" published an abstract from an article in the April 1952 issue of the so-called "International Committee of the Red Cross" organ, "International Red Cross Review," published in Geneva. This article admitted that the U.S. massacred prisoners of war on Koje Island on February 18. The "Workers' Daily" said: This article "shows that the U.S. military headquarters forcibly screened prisoners of war, regardless of their wishes; if they protested, they were brutally shot; they were not allowed to take care of the wounded and dead prisoners; and the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war was violated."

The "Workers' Daily" also published a series of photos titled "Contrast between Barbarism and Civilization" covering nearly three-quarters of the front page. These photos depicted the barbarous abuse of prisoners of war by the U.S. troops invading Korea: prisoners were naked, and captured female nurses were tried naked; on the other hand, they depicted prisoners of war in the hands of the Korean and Chinese armies being cared for and living comfortable and happy lives: American prisoners were very happy to see a pig being led to the kitchen; three British prisoners were playing chess; Korean children were watching American prisoners playing ball.

The "Workers' Daily" also published interviews with the families of British prisoners of war by the newspaper's reporters. The reporter wrote: The families of prisoners of war from all over Britain who were interviewed always asked: "Why can't they let our children come home?" For example, Mrs. Teresa Gambell said: "This armistice negotiation could have ended tomorrow, but the United States is delaying it. This really makes me angry." Her son is a prisoner of war in Korea. Mrs. M. Carl Whylie said: "I think it is a completely legitimate demand for Korea to return all their prisoners. Would we like it if our people were screened like this? I will do everything I can to get Arthur home." Her son, Arthur Carl Whylie, is also a prisoner of war in Korea. Mrs. Lavinia Liggett said: "None of our children should be left there." Her son is in the same prisoner of war camp as Arthur Carl Whylie.

On the same day, the "Workers' Daily" editorial called on the British people to pay attention to the voices of British women demanding an immediate armistice and the return of all prisoners, and reminded the British people: "The only obstacle to the current armistice is the U.S. refusal to return all Chinese and North Korean prisoners." The editorial pointed out: Even the report of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" proves that the so-called claim that some Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war are unwilling to return to their countries is a deceptive lie. The editorial concluded: "To prolong this war for one more day on this pretext is to deliberately use the most trivial excuses to carry out massacres."

### 英“工人日报”发表专文和社论  斥美方拖延停战谈判

    英“工人日报”发表专文和社论
    斥美方拖延停战谈判
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】伦敦“工人日报”在十七日发表了一系列的文章和照片，痛斥美国侵略者强迫扣留和虐待朝中战俘的暴行。
    “工人日报”在“美国枪杀俘虏——华盛顿和白厅不敢发表这种事实”的通栏标题下刊载了在日内瓦出版的所谓“红十字国际委员会”的机关刊物“红十字国际评论”一九五二年四月号中一篇文章的摘要，这篇文章承认二月十八日美国在巨济岛屠杀战俘。“工人日报”说：这篇文章“表明，美军总司令部强迫甄别战俘，而不顾他们的愿望；如果他们表示抗议，就把他们惨加枪杀；不让他们照料伤亡的俘虏；把日内瓦战俘公约都破坏了。”
    “工人日报”并以头版的将近四分之三的篇幅刊载了一些题为“野蛮与文明的对比”的照片。这些照片一面描绘了侵朝美军野蛮虐待战俘的情形：俘虏们赤身露体，被俘的女护士裸体受审；一面描绘了朝中军队手里的战俘受到照顾和过着舒服愉快的生活的情形：美国俘虏看到一只猪被牵到厨房去，显得很高兴；三个英国俘虏在下棋；朝鲜儿童在看美国俘虏打球。
    “工人日报”还刊载了该报记者对英国战俘家属的访问记。记者写道：被访问的英国各地的战俘家属总是问：“为什么他们不能让我们的孩子回家呢？”例如苔莉萨·甘贝尔夫人说：“这个停战谈判本可以明天就结束的，美国却一味拖延。这真使我气愤极了。”她的儿子在朝鲜当了战俘。M·卡尔怀利夫人说：“我认为朝鲜要求放回他们的所有俘虏是完全正当的要求。如果我们的人像这样受到甄别，我们愿意不愿意呢？我愿尽一切力量使阿瑟回家。”他的儿子阿瑟·卡尔怀利也在朝鲜当了俘虏。拉维尼亚·李盖特夫人说：“我们的孩子谁也不应当留在那里。”她的儿子跟阿瑟·卡尔怀利同在一个战俘营里。
    同日“工人日报”的社论号召英国人民注意英国妇女要求立即实现停战和放回一切俘虏的呼声，并提醒英国人民说：“目前停战的唯一障碍是美国拒绝放回全部中国俘虏和北朝鲜俘虏。”社论指出：连
    “红十字国际委员会”的报告，也证明所谓有些中朝战俘不愿回国的说法是骗人的谎言。社论末了说：“用这种藉口把这场战争多延长一天，就是立意利用最无聊的托词来进行屠杀。”
