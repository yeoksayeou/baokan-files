The Tianjin Railway Administration

In the autumn of 1950, locomotive No. 11592 of the Tianjin Railway Administration, with the help of Soviet experts, ran 612 kilometers in one day. This fact proved that a locomotive could travel 500 kilometers a day. However, at that time, the leadership lacked experience and had an insufficient understanding of the issue, so that this experimental work was aborted due to opposition from some people. Last September, we selected the Guye Locomotive Depot as the experimental section for the 500-kilometer movement. Last December, all the freight locomotives used by this depot traveled an average of 500.3 kilometers per day. This proved that the 500-kilometer movement was possible and necessary to carry out. The Tianjin Railway Administration then decided to first launch the 500-kilometer movement in the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau, requiring the entire sub-bureau to achieve a daily car kilometer of 500 kilometers. This April, the entire Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau achieved a daily car kilometer of 521.8 kilometers. This is a great victory. In order to better carry out the full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements, it is very meaningful to summarize the experiences of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau in carrying out the 500-kilometer movement over the past eight months.

(1) What are the Benefits of Carrying Out the 500-Kilometer Movement?

In carrying out the 500-kilometer movement, the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau created new quotas and broke through old standards. The daily car kilometer for freight locomotives in April was 521.8 kilometers, an increase of 76 kilometers compared to last September (before the movement was launched). The technical speed was 38.4 kilometers, an increase of 1.4 kilometers compared to last September. The locomotive turnaround time was 12.06 hours, a decrease of 2.02 hours compared to last September. After the 500-kilometer movement was launched, labor productivity increased. In early April, each freight locomotive in operation at the Guye Locomotive Depot averaged 784,724 ton-kilometers per day, an increase of 266,112 ton-kilometers compared to last September, with a labor productivity increase of 51.7 percent. Vehicle turnaround accelerated. The average train travel time between Tianjin and Dezhou was 9.36 hours, a reduction of 2.38 hours compared to last September. The entire sub-bureau saved 60,818 car hours in one month. Train delays have been basically overcome. The on-time departure rate for freight trains reached 93 percent, and the on-time arrival rate reached 90 percent. The train traction tonnage increased. The average traction of each freight train reached 1,617.3 tons, an increase of 108 tons compared to last September. The quality of the line was strengthened. The speed limit for entering stations between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan was increased from 45 kilometers to 55 kilometers, and the line's permissible speed was increased to 80 kilometers. Locomotive coal consumption was saved. The current coal consumption per 10,000 ton-kilometers is 179.99 kilograms, while it was 208.35 kilograms in April last year. One month saved 1,398 tons of coal. It can be said that carrying out the 500-kilometer movement has become an important lever for promoting economic accounting.

(2) What Ideological Problems Occurred During the Movement?

The process of carrying out the 500-kilometer movement is also a process of ideological struggle. It is mainly manifested in the following issues:

"Can locomotives run 500 kilometers?" The fact that advanced drivers Zheng Xikun and Qiao Yuyan of the Northeast Railway, with the help of Soviet experts, drove locomotives to achieve 500 daily car kilometers has already answered this question. Locomotive No. 11592 of the Tianjin Railway Administration also achieved 500 daily car kilometers in 1950. These iron facts powerfully criticized the erroneous thinking of some technical personnel who worshipped Anglo-American old quotas and old standards. They believed that locomotives could not run 500 kilometers, that doing so was risky, and that it would "break the locomotives." The facts refuted this conservative opinion.

"You can run it there, but I can't here." It is not easy or even possible to run 500 kilometers on single-track sections with short intervals and many train services (such as the Beijing Ring Line) and on sections with large gradients (such as the Guangou section). However, these sections can still participate in the 500-kilometer movement. Due to the different conditions of each line, the requirements should also be different. Some should strive to run 500 kilometers as the main goal of the struggle, while others should strive to exceed the daily car kilometer standard stipulated by the tight timetable as the goal of the struggle. This approach is reasonable. The view that all lines must run 500 kilometers, regardless of the line, is wrong.

In 1950, there was a tendency for dispatchers to favor locomotives with the 500-kilometer red flag; recently, in order to increase the daily car kilometer, there have also been phenomena such as dissatisfaction with axle traction and running single locomotives. These shortcomings are unavoidable when there is no experience, but they can be overcome. People who oppose the 500-kilometer movement not only do not offer suggestions to overcome these shortcomings, but instead use these shortcomings to negatively criticize the movement, believing that the movement is undesirable. Obviously, this view is wrong.

Some people believe that the 500-kilometer movement is only a matter for the locomotive department. These people do not care about the 500-kilometer movement, do not help it, and even hinder the 500-kilometer movement for the benefit of their own unit. When repairing locomotives, some people disregard the quality of the locomotives. When dispatching, some people arbitrarily waste locomotives in order to complete transportation tasks. Some railway sub-bureaus do not arrange trains according to plan in order to shorten their own vehicle turnover rate. These phenomena that hinder the development of the 500-kilometer movement are partly caused by the fact that some old systems and old methods of division of labor have not been abolished, and new systems and new methods of division of labor have not been established. This must be resolved by reforming the system. The main reason is departmentalism. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for employees, resolutely struggle against these erroneous ideas, and lay a good ideological foundation for carrying out the full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements.

(3) How to Carry Out the 500-Kilometer Movement?

In the 500-kilometer movement, the driver is the main force of the movement, the dispatching office is the command post of the movement, and the administration and sub-bureau are the leaders and organizers of the movement. All other relevant business departments should clearly establish the idea of taking the 500-kilometer movement as the central goal of improving business, and each should fulfill its due responsibilities. With such a clear division of labor, the 500-kilometer movement can be carried out in a planned, led, and orderly manner. Based on the experience of the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau in carrying out the 500-kilometer movement, the following four points are initially summarized:

First, the driver should play a leading role

Experience has shown that locomotive drivers are the main force in the 500-kilometer movement. To give play to their main force role, the following points must be achieved:

First of all, drivers must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and learn the operating methods of advanced driver Zheng Xikun, such as opening the throttle wide and raising the lever high. Different operating methods should be adopted in different situations. Therefore, drivers must conscientiously combine their own experience to study the theory of operating technology in order to improve operating technology.

Secondly, drivers must learn the Soviet three-shovel coal throwing method and the ring-shaped coal throwing method to replace the old cross-coal throwing method. This will give play to the firepower of the coal and ensure that the operating method of opening the throttle wide and raising the lever high can be implemented. It is also necessary to adopt the Soviet method of softening hard water to completely remove water rust and increase the locomotive's power. Drivers must also learn the Soviet Lunin-style locomotive maintenance method so that drivers can self-check and self-repair and be good at oiling. This ensures the quality of the locomotive.

In addition, drivers must actively maintain close contact with the dispatching department, reflect operating conditions, strive for reasonable meetings (reasonable passing of trains), and eliminate waiting phenomena (not waiting for other trains) in order to arrive at the terminal station in a timely manner. Drivers must also actively contact the train captain to understand the train's traction tonnage and loading conditions in order to correctly prescribe their operating methods.

Second, the dispatching office should play a commanding role

Experience has shown that doing a good job in train dispatching is the key to carrying out the 500-kilometer movement. In the movement, the dispatching department must play a commanding role. To give play to its commanding role, the following things must be done well:

First of all, the dispatching office must do a good job in the daily transportation plan and organize the various railway staff, otherwise, the operation will be chaotic and the efficiency of the locomotive cannot be brought into play. To do a good job in the daily transportation plan, the dispatcher must be familiar with various transportation conditions and establish various forecasting systems; must unify locomotive dispatching and train dispatching; must correctly understand the source of goods and vehicle operation status; and must implement the Yang Maolin loading method. According to the daily transportation situation, the plan must be reviewed and revised every six hours. Based on the daily transportation plan, determine the 500-kilometer operation chart for the day, and try to help the driver shorten travel time and locomotive turnaround time.

In order to do a good job in the 500-kilometer operation chart, the dispatcher must flexibly take care of the overall transportation situation. For example, when train operation is unbalanced and there are too many trains waiting to depart, trains with over-axle traction can be assembled.

Secondly, when implementing the daily transportation plan and the 500-kilometer operation chart, the train dispatcher should use all possible conditions to shorten travel time and bring into play the locomotive's efficiency. For example, rationally organize train meetings, use meeting time to add water, and perform shunting operations; or use shunting time for train meetings. In addition, the dispatcher must actively establish close contact with the driver, urge the driver to reflect operating conditions, and make requests to the driver, encouraging the driver to consciously complete the task ahead of schedule. At the same time, dispatching discipline should be strictly enforced, and phenomena that violate discipline should be fought against.

Third, all relevant departments should play an active role in the movement

Carrying out the 500-kilometer movement is actually organizing large-scale joint labor by all relevant departments on the basis of new operating methods. Without joint labor of this nature, it is impossible to carry out the 500-kilometer movement. Therefore, all relevant departments must actively promote advanced working methods around the 500-kilometer movement and give play to the role of each department. For example, the station must promote the Li Xikui shunting method to accelerate the assembling operation to ensure that the locomotive does not wait for the train; the business department must promote the Yang Maolin loading method to increase the vehicle's loading capacity; the maintenance department must strengthen maintenance work to improve the quality of locomotives and vehicles; the engineering department must learn the Nie Feidov track maintenance method to ensure that the line condition is always good; and the telecommunications department must try out the joint work area system to improve communication work and signal equipment. Only when relevant departments can actively work and cooperate with each other can the 500-kilometer movement be successfully carried out.

Fourth, the administration and sub-bureau should play a leading role

The Tianjin Railway Administration and the Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau have always paid attention to ideological leadership in the movement, launched ideological struggles, criticized various erroneous ideas that opposed the 500-kilometer movement, and corrected various deviations that occurred in the movement; and organized employees to study various new operating methods of the 500-kilometer movement, summarized the experiences created by the masses, and promoted these experiences in a planned and step-by-step manner. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the administrative, trade union, and youth league organizations at all levels of the entire Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau acted in unison, actively organized the broad masses of employees to participate in this movement, and cultivated many backbone members in the movement, laying the foundation for carrying out the full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements in the future.

(4) Several Shortcomings in the Movement

The Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau has achieved great results in carrying out the 500-kilometer movement, but there are also some shortcomings. Cadres in certain areas and departments do not pay enough attention to the work of promoting advanced experience. They have not earnestly implemented Zheng Xikun's over-axle operation method. Many locomotives cannot be over-axle, and there are even phenomena of under-axle. Some business workers have not yet fully adopted the Yang Maolin loading method, and the vehicle's loading capacity is not high enough. Therefore, the 500-kilometer, full load, and over-axle movements must be carried out as an indivisible movement. In addition, phenomena such as running single locomotives, locomotives waiting for trains, and poor locomotive quality are still very serious. Not enough attention has been paid to improving the lives and cultural education of employees. The incentive system for promoting the 500-kilometer movement has not yet been established. The Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau must correct these shortcomings, prevent pride, consolidate achievements, so as to create greater results in the full load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer movements.

    天津铁路分局开展五百公里运动的经验
    天津铁路管理局
    一九五○年秋季，天津铁路管理局的冖ㄎ1一五九二号机车，在苏联专家帮助下一天跑了六百一十二公里。这个事实证明：一台机车一天是能够走行五百公里的。但是，当时领导方面缺乏经验，对这个问题的认识也很不够，以致这一试验工作，竟因遭到某些人的反对而流产了。去年九月，我们选定古冶机务段为五百公里的试验段。去年十二月，这个段所有的运用的货物机车，平均每天跑了五百零一点三公里。这就证明了五百公里运动是能够而且必须开展的。天津铁路管理局遂确定先在天津铁路分局开展五百公里运动，要求全分局日车公里达到五百公里。今年四月，整个天津铁路分局日车公里达到五百二十一点八公里。这是一个很大的胜利。为了很好地开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，把天津铁路分局在八个月来开展五百公里运动的一些经验总结起来，是非常有意义的。
    （一）开展五百公里运动有什么好处
    天津铁路分局在开展五百公里运动中，创造了新的定额，突破了旧的标准。货物机车日车公里四月份为五百二十一点八公里，比去年九月份（运动开展以前）提高了七十六公里。技术速度三十八点四公里，比去年九月份提高了一点四公里。机车周转时间十二点零六小时，比去年九月份缩短了二点零二小时。开展五百公里运动后，劳动生产率提高了。古冶机务段四月上旬每台运用的货物机车平均每天是七十八万四千七百二十四吨公里，比去年九月份增加了二十六万六千一百十二吨公里，劳动生产率提高了百分之五十一点七。车辆周转加快了。天津德县间平均列车旅行时间九点三六小时，比去年九月缩短二点三八小时。全分局一个月节省六万零八百十八车小时。列车晚点现象基本上克服了。货物列车正点出发达百分之九十三，正点到达达百分之九十。列车牵引吨数增加了。每列货车平均牵引达一千六百十七点三吨，比去年九月份增加了一百零八吨。线路质量加强了。天津山海关间进站限制速度由四十五公里提高到五十五公里，线路容许速度提高到八十公里。机车燃煤节省了。每万吨公里现用煤一百七十九点九九公斤，而去年四月份用煤二百零八点三五公斤。一个月节省用煤一千三百九十八吨。可以说，开展五百公里运动成为推行经济核算制的重要杠杆。
    （二）运动中发生了那些思想问题
    开展五百公里运动的过程，也就是一个思想斗争的过程。主要表现于下列几个问题：
    “机车能不能跑到五百公里？”东北铁路的先进司机郑锡坤、乔玉岩等在苏联专家帮助之下，驾驶机车达到五百日车公里的事实，已经答覆了这个问题。天津铁路管理局冖ㄎ1一五九二号机车在一九五○年也达到五百日车公里。这些铁的事实，有力地批判了崇拜英美的旧定额、旧标准的某些技术人员的错误思想。他们认为机车不可能跑到五百公里，这样做是冒险的，是会“把机车跑散了”的。事实批驳了这种保守的意见。
    “你那里可以跑，我这里可不行。”在区间短、车次多的单线区间（如北京环城线）以及大坡道区间
    （如关沟段），不容易甚至不可能跑到五百公里。但是这些区间，还是能够参加五百公里运动的。由于各个线路的情况不同，要求也应有所不同。有的应以争取跑到五百公里为主要的斗争目标，有的应以争取超过紧密运行图所规定的日车公里标准为奋斗目标。这种做法是合理的。那种认为不分线路都要跑到五百公里的看法，是错误的。
    一九五○年曾发生过调度员偏爱五百公里红旗机车的偏向；最近，为提高日车公里，也曾发生过不满轴牵引、放单机等现象。这些缺点在没有经验的时候是难免的，但是是能够克服的。反对五百公里运动的人们，不仅不提出克服这些缺点的意见，反而拿着这些缺点，消极地指责这个运动，认为这个运动要不得。显然易见，这种观点是错误的。
    有些人认为五百公里运动，只是机务部门的事。这些人对于五百公里运动，不关心，不帮助，甚至为了本单位的利益，阻碍五百公里运动。修车时，有些人不顾机车质量。调度时，有些人为了完成运输任务，随意浪费机车。有些铁路分局为了缩短自己的车辆周转率，不按计划排车。这些阻碍五百公里运动开展的现象，一部分原因，是若干旧的制度、旧的分工方法没有废除，新的制度、新的分工方法没有建立所造成的。这就必须从改革制度上加以解决。而主要的原因是本位主义。因此，要加强对职工的思想教育，坚决地向这些错误思想作斗争，为开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动打好思想基础。
    （三）怎样开展五百公里运动
    在五百公里运动中，以司机为运动的主力，以调度所为运动的指挥所，以管理局和分局为运动的领导者和组织者，其他有关各业务部门，都应明确树立以五百公里运动为改进业务的中心目标的思想，各尽其应尽的责任。有了这样明确的分工，才能有计划地、有领导地、有秩序地开展五百公里运动。根据天津铁路分局开展五百公里运动的经验，初步归纳起来，有以下四点：
    第一、司机应该发挥主力作用
    经验证明：机车司机是五百公里运动的主力。而要发挥其主力作用，必须做到以下几点：
    首先，司机必须学习苏联先进经验，学会先进司机郑锡坤的大开汽门、高提手把的操纵方法。在不同的情况下，要采用不同的操纵方法。因此，司机必须认真地结合自己的经验，来学习有关操纵技术的理论，以提高操纵技术。
    其次，司机必须学会苏联的三锹投煤法和环状投煤法，来代替旧的交叉投煤法。这样就发挥了煤的火力，保证了大开汽门、高提手把的操纵方法得以实行。并且必须采用苏联的化硬水为软水的方法，彻底扫除水锈，增加机车的气力。司机还必须学会苏联的鲁宁式机车保养法，使司机能够自检自修，并善于给油。这样，就保证了机车的质量。
    此外，司机必须主动地和调度部门保持密切的联系，反映运行情况，争取合理会让（合理地错车）、消灭待避现象（不等待别的列车），以便及时到达终点站。司机还必须主动地和车长联系，了解列车牵引吨数和装载情况，以便正确地规定自己的操纵方法。
    第二、调度所应该发挥指挥作用
    经验证明：做好列车的调度工作，是开展五百公里运动的重要关键。在运动中，调度部门必须起指挥的作用。而要发挥其指挥作用，必须做好以下几件事情：
    首先，调度所必须做好运输日计划，把铁路的各种工作人员组织起来，否则，运行紊乱，就不能发挥机车的效能。要做好运输日计划，调度员必须熟悉有关运输的各种情况，建立各种预报制度；必须统一机车调度和行车调度；必须正确了解货源和车辆运行状况；必须实行杨茂林装车法。根据每天运输情况，每六小时必须审查修订一次计划。根据运输日计划定出当天的五百公里运行图，尽量地帮助司机缩短旅行时间和机车折返时间。
    为了做好五百公里运行图，调度员必须机动灵活地照顾全盘的运输情况。比如在列车运行不平衡、待发车过多的时候，可以编组超轴牵引的列车。
    其次，行车调度员在执行运输日计划和五百公里运行图时，应该利用一切可能的条件，来缩短旅行时间，发挥机车效能。比如合理地组织会让，利用会让时间上水，和进行甩挂作业；或利用在甩挂时间会让。此外，调度员必须主动地和司机取得密切联系，督促司机反映运行情况，并向司机提出要求，鼓励司机自觉地提前完成任务。同时应该严格调度纪律，和违反纪律的现象作斗争。
    第三、各有关部门在运动中应该发挥积极作用
    开展五百公里运动，实际是组织各有关部门在新的作业方法基础上进行大规模的联合劳动。没有这样性质的联合劳动，开展五百公里运动是不可能的。因此各有关部门必须围绕五百公里运动，积极推广先进工作方法，发挥各个部门的作用。例如，车站必须推广李锡奎调车法，加速编组作业，以保证机车不等列车；商务部门必须推广杨茂林装车法，以便提高车辆的装载量；检修部门必须加强检修工作，提高机车、车辆的质量；工务部门必须学习聂菲铎夫养路法，以保证线路状况经常良好；电务部门必须试行联合工区制，改善通讯工作和信号设备。只有有关部门都能积极地工作，互相配合，五百公里运动才能胜利开展。
    第四、管理局和分局应该发挥领导作用
    天津铁路管理局和天津铁路分局在运动中始终注意了思想领导，展开了思想斗争，批判了各种各样反对五百公里运动的错误思想，纠正了在运动中所发生的各种偏差；并且组织职工学习了五百公里运动的各种新作业方法，总结了群众创造的经验，并有计划有步骤地推广这些经验。在党的统一领导下，整个天津铁路分局的各级行政、工会、青年团一致行动起来，积极组织广大职工，参加了这一运动，并在运动中培养了许多骨干分子，为今后开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动打下了基础。
    （四）运动中的几个缺点
    天津铁路分局在开展五百公里运动中，取得了很大的成绩，但也有一些缺点。某些地区和部门的干部对于推广先进经验的工作还不够重视。他们没有认真实行郑锡坤的超轴作业法，很多机车不能超轴，甚至还有欠轴的现象。有些商务工作者还未完全采用杨茂林装车法，车辆的装载量还不够高。因此，必须把五百公里和满载、超轴当做一个不可分割的运动开展起来。此外，跑单机、机车等列车、机车质量不良等现象还很严重。对于职工的生活改善和文化教育等，还没有足够的注意。推行五百公里运动的奖励制度，也还没有建立起来。天津铁路分局必须纠正这些缺点，防止骄傲，巩固成绩，以便在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，创造出更大的成果来。
