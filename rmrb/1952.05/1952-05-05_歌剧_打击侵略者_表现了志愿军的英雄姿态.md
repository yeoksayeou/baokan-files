    The Opera "Strike the Aggressors" Shows the Heroic Bearing of the Volunteer Army
    Editor's Note: Since the premiere of the opera "Strike the Aggressors" (script by Song Zhidi, Ding Yi, and Wei Wei) performed by the Central Academy of Drama's Affiliated Song and Dance Troupe in Beijing on March 27th, our newspaper has received contributions and letters from comrades such as Yan Gongzhan, Sang Fu, and Mu Xin, who believe that this opera is of educational significance to the audience. We are now publishing excerpts from the impressions of this play written by a comrade who has just returned from the Korean front:
    I finished watching the opera "Strike the Aggressors" with excitement. When various moving scenes of the Chinese and Korean people fighting side by side against the aggressors and achieving victory appeared on the stage, several of us comrades who had just returned from the Korean battlefield seemed to have returned to the world-renowned Korean battlefield, seeing the heroic bearing of the Volunteer Army warriors marching in the wind and snow, seeing the fraternal friendship overflowing between the Korean people and the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and seeing the bloody crimes of the man-eating American aggressors. The enthusiastic applause of the audience fully demonstrated their sincere respect and love for the Volunteer Army.
    "Strike the Aggressors" is one of the relatively large-scale operas depicting the war life on the Korean front. It expresses the noble qualities and revolutionary heroism of the Volunteer Army, as well as the Korean people and the Korean People's Army's strong and unyielding patriotic behavior and invincible strength. The script is permeated with the spirit of patriotism and internationalism from beginning to end, and positively portrays the noble qualities of the working people and the people's army. Every cadre, soldier, and person who appears on the stage is a hardworking, simple, resolute, tenacious, brave, and decisive lovable person. Over the past year, many plays depicting this great theme have been performed across the country, but there are not many works that systematically and comprehensively reflect the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army like this one, so the premiere of this play has been welcomed by the masses.
    I think this opera still has some shortcomings, such as a weak storyline and the failure to create typical characters, so the audience's impression after watching it is not very deep. But it is still an educational play, inspiring the people of the motherland to more enthusiastically participate in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and contribute greater strength to defeating the common enemy of mankind, supporting our close friends, and defending our great motherland.

### 歌剧“打击侵略者”表现了志愿军的英雄姿态

    歌剧“打击侵略者”表现了志愿军的英雄姿态
    编者按：中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院演出的歌剧“打击侵略者”（宋之的、丁毅、魏巍编剧）自三月二十七日在北京演出后，本报曾收到阎公展、桑夫、穆欣等同志的来稿、来信，认为这个歌剧对观众是有教育意义的。现在把刚从朝鲜前线回来的一位同志写的对这个剧的观感摘要登载如下：
    我带着兴奋的心情看完歌剧“打击侵略者”。当舞台上出现中朝人民对侵略者并肩作战、取得胜利的各种动人的场景时，我们几个刚从朝鲜战场归来的同志，仿佛又回到了举世瞩目的朝鲜战场上，看见了志愿军勇士们在风雪中进军的英雄姿态，看见了朝鲜人民和我国志愿军指战员中间洋溢着的手足情谊，看见了吃人生番美国侵略者的血腥罪行。观众的热烈掌声充分说明了他们对于志愿军的衷心的崇敬和热爱。
    “打击侵略者”是描写朝鲜前线战争生活的比较大型的歌剧之一。它表现了志愿军的高贵品质和革命英雄主义，也表现了朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军坚强不屈的爱国行为和不可战胜的力量。剧本从头到尾贯串着爱国主义和国际主义的精神，积极地从正面表现了劳动人民与人民军队的高贵品质。在舞台上所出现的每一个干部、战士和人民，都是勤劳朴实、坚毅顽强、英勇果敢的可爱的人。一年多来，全国各地曾经演出过不少描写这一伟大主题的剧作，但像这样比较系统的全面的反映志愿军和朝鲜人民军的作品还不很多，所以这个剧的公演受到了群众的欢迎。
    我认为这个歌剧还有一些缺点，如故事性不强、没有塑造出典型人物的形象等，以致观众看后印象还不很深刻。但它仍不失为一个有教育意义的剧，它鼓舞着祖国人民更加热烈地参加抗美援朝运动，为战胜人类公敌、支援亲密的友人、保卫我们伟大的祖国而贡献更大的力量。
