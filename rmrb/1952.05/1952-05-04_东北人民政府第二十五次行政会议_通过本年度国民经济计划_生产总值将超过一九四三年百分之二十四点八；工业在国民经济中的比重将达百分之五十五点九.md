Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. The Northeast People's Government held its twenty-fifth administrative conference on April 28th and approved the 1952 Northeast Region National Economic Plan. According to this plan, the total output value of state-owned and public industries in the Northeast region in 1952 will increase by 41.5 percent compared to 1951; the total agricultural output value will increase by 20.6 percent; and the total amount of industrial capital construction will increase by 125 percent. After the implementation of this industrial and agricultural production plan, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Northeast region will exceed that of 1943 by 24.8 percent; the proportion of industry in the region's national economy will increase from 52.6 percent in 1951 to 55.9 percent; the proportion of state-owned industry in the region's total industrial output value, the industrial production equipment capacity, and the number of technical personnel and skilled workers will all greatly increase.

    Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out at the meeting that the 1952 National Economic Plan is a plan for the Northeast region to begin large-scale economic construction with emphasis and step-by-step, a plan to further strengthen economic and defense forces, and a plan for the Northeast to move forward towards industrialization. This plan is the result of several years of struggle by the working people of the entire Northeast under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government. Therefore, all departments must recognize the importance of this plan and must strive to ensure its completion and overfulfillment. Lin Feng then said: In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the plan, the following work must be done well: (1) Each department should formulate its own specific plans based on the overall plan. Not only should annual plans be made, but also quarterly, monthly, and even ten-day plans, and specific methods for completing the tasks must be formulated. Efforts must be organized to conduct practical inspections and resolutely implement the plan. At the same time, personnel, supervision, public security, and judicial departments should also formulate plans to ensure the completion of the national economic plan. (2) The 1952 National Economic Plan is an arduous and glorious task for the people of the entire Northeast. In order to realize this plan, we must rely on the broad masses of working people, on the entire working class, and on all working farmers. Therefore, after the plans of each department are formulated, discussions should be organized among all working people and the broad masses of workers and cadres to transform the plans into practical actions of the masses. At the same time, specific plans for completing the tasks should be formulated at each level, all the way down to individual action plans. It is necessary to bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of all working people and the broad masses of workers and cadres in the Northeast, extensively launch a patriotic production increase and economy campaign, and ensure the completion or overfulfillment of the plan. (3) We must accept the lessons of the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements, constantly and continuously conduct in-depth inspections of shortcomings and errors in our work, and propose methods for improvement, so that the work of each department can be improved and advanced after the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" movements. Inspecting work is the key to ensuring the completion of tasks. In addition to each department regularly inspecting its own work, the General Office of the Government, the People's Economic Planning Committee, and the People's Supervisory Committee must organize inspections in a timely manner, and the old method of simply summarizing work once a year or every six months must be overcome. Various necessary working systems must be established and improved, especially supervision systems, financial systems, personnel systems, and learning systems. Attention should be paid to summarizing and promoting advanced production experiences and advanced working methods, establishing a reward system, tapping the potential in industrial and agricultural production, and creating a new upsurge in production. Political work and ideological leadership must be strengthened. (4) We must conscientiously do a good job in the welfare work of employees. Administrative leaders at all levels should regularly care about and improve the welfare work of employees. The shortcomings in the welfare work of employees must be conscientiously inspected and resolutely corrected.

    东北人民政府第二十五次行政会议
    通过本年度国民经济计划
    生产总值将超过一九四三年百分之二十四点八；工业在国民经济中的比重将达百分之五十五点九
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北人民政府在四月二十八日举行第二十五次行政会议，通过了一九五二年度东北区国民经济计划。根据这个计划，一九五二年东北全区国营和公营工业的生产总值将比一九五一年提高百分之四十一点五；农业生产总值将提高百分之二十点六；工业基本建设总量将增长百分之一百二十五。这一项工农业生产计划实现以后，东北全区工农业生产总值将超过一九四三年百分之二十四点八；全区工业在国民经济中的比重，将由一九五一年的百分之五十二点六提高到百分之五十五点九；国营工业在全区工业生产总值中所占的比重，工业生产设备能力以及技术人员和技术工人都会有极大的增加。
    东北人民政府副主席林枫在会上指出：一九五二年国民经济计划是东北地区开始有重点地有步骤地进行大规模经济建设的计划，是进一步增强经济力量和国防力量的计划，是东北向工业化前进一步的计划。这个计划是全东北劳动人民在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府领导下几年来奋斗的成果，因此，各部门必须认识这个计划的重要性，必须努力保证完成和超过这一计划。林枫接着说：为了保证完成和超过计划，必须做好下列工作：（一）各个部门应根据总的计划订出自己的具体计划。不仅要做出年度计划，而且要做出季度、月度以至每旬的计划，并须制定完成任务的具体办法。要组织力量，切实进行检查，坚决贯彻。同时人事、监察、公安、司法等部门也应做出保证完成国民经济计划的计划。（二）一九五二年国民经济计划是全东北人民的一个艰巨而又光荣的任务，为了实现这一计划，必须依靠广大劳动人民，依靠全体工人阶级，全体劳动农民，因此各个部门的计划订出后应在全体劳动人民和广大职工、干部中组织讨论，把计划变成广大群众的实际行动，同时要逐层订出完成任务的具体计划，一直到个人的行动计划。要将东北全体劳动人民和广大职工、干部的积极性、创造性发挥起来，广泛地发动爱国主义增产节约竞赛运动，保证完成或超过计划。（三）必须接受“三反”“五反”运动的教训，经常不断地深入检查工作中的缺点、错误和提出改进的办法，使每个部门的工作在“三反”、“五反”运动之后都能提高一步，前进一步。检查工作是保证完成任务的关键，除各个部门自己要经常检查工作外，政府办公厅、人民经济计划委员会、人民监察委员会等必须及时地组织检查，要克服那种单纯的一年或半年总结一次工作的老办法。要将各种必要的工作制度建立和健全起来，特别是监督制度、财务制度、人事制度和学习制度等。要注意总结和推广先进生产经验和先进工作方法，建立奖励制度，发挥工农业生产中的潜在力，造成新的生产高潮。要加强政治工作和思想领导。（四）要认真做好职工福利工作，各级行政领导干部应经常关心和改善职工福利工作，凡是目前能够做到的必须认真做好。职工福利工作中的缺点，必须认真检查，切实纠正。
