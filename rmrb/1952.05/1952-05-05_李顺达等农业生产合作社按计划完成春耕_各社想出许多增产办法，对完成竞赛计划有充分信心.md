Li Shunda, Geng Changsuo, and Lü Hongbin, the three agricultural production cooperatives that jointly initiated a comprehensive production increase competition among agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers nationwide, began various preparations as early as November of last year to complete this year's comprehensive production increase plan. They focused on resolving specific issues related to production increases. Currently, each cooperative is carrying out spring planting and wheat hoeing intensively and methodically according to plan.

Each cooperative has made great achievements in drought and flood prevention. The Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in a mountainous area, and all the cultivated land is dry land. To ensure timely sowing and full seedling emergence, laying the foundation for increasing yield per unit area, they dug eighteen "water storage pits," seven living water ponds, and three living water wells at the beginning of spring. They also universally carried out snow accumulation work on an area of sixty-six mu. In case of spring drought, it can be guaranteed that all 150 mu of cultivated land in the cooperative will be sown on time. The Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative originally had four water wells and thirty mu of irrigated land. This spring, three new water wells were dug, increasing the irrigated land of the entire cooperative to fifty mu (the entire cooperative has sixty-five mu of cultivated land). The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, which had the most difficulty digging wells, has completed one new brick well and repaired one old brick well. In addition, five earthen wells were dug, turning eighteen mu of high-yield land and thirty mu of dry land in the cooperative into paddy fields (the entire cooperative has 318 mu of cultivated land).

In terms of improving cultivation techniques, the Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative has completed the plan of plowing three times, harrowing twice, and raking three times for this year's autumn fields. Sixty percent of the land was plowed with new-style walking plows. At the same time, to ensure full seedling emergence and prevent pests and diseases, all kinds of seeds in this cooperative this year have been treated with medicine. In addition, the cooperative has also established a small farm for experimentation to create experience to guide the production of the entire cooperative. The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative has also completed the task of plowing two times for the autumn fields according to plan, and harrowed six times, exceeding the original plan of four times. The soil in the Lü Hongbin Cooperative is particularly hard, and new-style plows cannot be used for deep plowing. They use the method of heavy plowing (that is, the first plow goes over, and the second plow goes over the first plow furrow), and the eleven mu of high-yield land is deeply plowed about seven to eight inches.

In terms of increasing fertilizer, this year the three cooperatives have prepared more fully than in any previous year. The Li Shunda Cooperative has completed the plan of applying 110 dan of base fertilizer per mu under the most difficult conditions of accumulating fertilizer. Now, they are continuing to accumulate fertilizer while concentrating funds to purchase fertilizer powder, sesame cake, and other fine fertilizers, preparing to apply them as top dressing. In addition, a pig raising and fertilizer accumulation plan has been formulated. In addition to completing the plan of applying 3,900 jin of manure per mu as base fertilizer, the Geng Changsuo Cooperative also bought 12,000 jin of soybean cake (6,000 jin for base fertilizer and 6,000 jin for top dressing). In addition, nine pigs were purchased and three pigsties were added. Including the original six pigsties, there are now nine pigsties, which are estimated to accumulate 160,000 jin of pig manure per month. The Lü Hongbin Cooperative has also completed the fertilization plan. In addition to accumulating enough manure to apply 2,400 jin per mu, they also bought 200 jin of fertilizer powder and 4,000 jin of cake fertilizer.

The main reason why the spring plowing preparation work of these three cooperatives this year is better than in previous years is that they focused on solving many specific issues related to production increases. The Li Shunda Agricultural Production Cooperative was reorganized from a mutual aid team last winter. Due to years of mutual assistance in the past, agricultural production has been considerably developed, and output has increased year by year. Their average yield per mu in 1951 had increased from 170 jin when the mutual aid team was established in 1943 to 370 jin. How to continue to develop production and continue to increase output? On the original basis, the team members felt that their confidence was not high. However, after they were reorganized from mutual aid teams into agricultural production cooperatives last winter, the land changed from decentralized management to collective management, and they continued to invest heavily in the land, and determined a long-term development production policy, so the members' confidence in increasing production was increased a hundredfold. When they launched a patriotic production increase competition to mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers across the country this year, they demanded that the average yield per mu be increased to 423 jin, an increase of more than 10% compared to last year. All the land of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative is dry land, which is often threatened by drought. Geng Changsuo seized this main problem and planned to gradually turn dry land into paddy fields and increase output year by year. However, the local groundwater level is particularly low, and it is very difficult to dig wells. To dig a well with sufficient water, it is necessary to drill down to the spring. Locally, to drill a well, it is necessary to first drill ten zhang deep, and then drill down more than fifty zhang to find the underground spring. In this way, it costs at least 10 million yuan to drill a well. In order to solve the difficulty of well drilling funds, Geng Changsuo encouraged the members to invest in the cooperative, and also invested all the materials he had prepared for building houses for many years (because his family has many people and needed to build houses five years ago) into the cooperative. Now they have repaired an old well (which can irrigate more than ten mu of land), drilled a new well (which can irrigate more than twenty mu of land), built five earthen wells, installed two waterwheels, and newly built seven brick houses as houses for expanding livestock breeding. This has turned eighteen mu of high-yield land and thirty mu of dry land into paddy fields, laying the foundation for increasing production. The Lü Hongbin Cooperative mainly solved the problem of deep plowing. Because the soil of their cooperative is hard, it is not easy to deep plow, which affects the continued increase in output. This spring, the members came up with a method of deep plowing with "heavy plows," which can generally plow to seven to eight inches, solving this problem. Because these three cooperatives have come up with ways to increase production according to their specific circumstances, they have high confidence in completing this year's patriotic production increase competition plan.

    李顺达等农业生产合作社按计划完成春耕
    各社想出许多增产办法，对完成竞赛计划有充分信心
    联名向全国农业生产合作社、互助组和农民发起全面增产竞赛的李顺达、耿长锁、吕鸿宾三个农业生产合作社，为了完成今年的全面增产计划，各社从去年十一月就开始了各项准备工作，并着重解决了有关增产的一些具体问题，目前各社正按照计划有步骤地紧张地进行春耕播种和锄麦等工作。
    各社在防旱防涝方面都有很大成绩。李顺达农业生产合作社是在山区，耕地全部是旱地，为了作到按时播种保证全苗，打下提高单位面积产量的基础，他们一开春就打好十八个“蓄水坑”，七个活水池，三眼活水井，还在六十六亩地的面积上普遍地进行了积雪工作，如遇春旱可保证全社一百五十多亩耕地按时播种。吕鸿宾农业生产合作社原有四眼水井，三十亩水地，今春又新打三眼水井，使全社水浇地增加到五十亩（全社共有六十五亩耕地）。打井最困难的耿长锁农业生产合作社已锥好一眼新砖井，修好一眼旧砖井，此外还打了五眼土井，将社里的十八亩丰产地和三十亩旱地变成了水田（全社共三百一十八亩耕地）。
    在改进耕作技术方面，李顺达农业生产合作社今年的秋田已按计划完成了耕三、耙二、耢三的计划，其中有百分之六十的地都是用新式步犁翻耕的。同时为了保证全苗和防止病虫害，这个社今年的各种种籽已全部是用药剂拌种。此外，这个社还举办了一个小型农场作试验，以便创造经验指导全社生产。耿长锁农业生产合作社的秋田也按计划完成了普犁两遍的任务，并且耙了六遍，超过原计划四遍。吕鸿宾社的土质特硬，不能采用新式犁深耕，他们就采用重犁（即第一张犁犁过去，第二张犁再顺第一张犁沟犁过去）的办法，十一亩丰产地，深耕约七寸到八寸。
    在增加肥料方面，今年三个社比以往任何一年都准备得充分。李顺达社在积肥最困难的条件下已完成了每亩上一百一十担基肥的计划，现在正一面继续积肥，一面集中资金购买肥田粉、麻饼等细肥，准备作追肥施用。此外并订出了养猪积肥的计划。耿长锁社除按计划完成每亩上三千九百斤圈粪做基肥外，又买了一万二千斤豆饼（六千斤作基肥，六千斤作追肥）。此外又增买了九只猪和增加了三个猪圈，连原有的六个猪圈，已共有九个猪圈，估计每月能积十六万斤猪厩肥。吕鸿宾社也完成了施肥计划。除已积够每亩能上两千四百斤的圈粪外，还买了两百斤肥田粉和四千斤饼类肥料。
    这三个社今年的春耕准备工作所以比往年做的好的主要原因，是着重解决了许多有关增产的具体问题。李顺达农业生产合作社是去年冬天由互助组改组成立的，由于过去多年的互助，农业生产已有相当发展，产量已逐年提高。他们一九五一年的每亩平均产量已由一九四三年开始成立互助组时的一百七十斤提高到了三百七十斤。如何使生产继续向前发展、产量继续提高呢？在原有基础上组员们已感到信心不高。但是他们去年冬天由互助组改组为农业生产合作社以后，土地由分散经营变为集体经营，继续大量向土地投资，并确定了长期发展生产的方针，因而社员们的增产信心便百倍提高。他们今年向全国的互助组、农业生产合作社和单干农民发起爱国增产竞赛时，便要求每亩平均产量提高到四百二十三斤，较去年增产一成以上。耿长锁农业生产合作社的土地全部是旱地，经常遭受干旱的威胁。耿长锁抓住了这个主要问题，计划要逐年把旱地变成水田，提高产量。可是当地的地下水位特别低，打井非常困难。要想打一眼有充足水量的井，必须锥井下泉才能解决问题。当地锥一眼井，必须先打十丈深，然后再往下锥五十多丈深，才能找到井下泉。这样每锥一眼井最少得一千万元资金。耿长锁为了解决打井资金的困难，一方面鼓励社员向合作社投资，一面又把自己多年准备修房的材料（因他家人口多早五年前就需要修房了）也全部投入了合作社。现在他们已修好一眼旧井（可浇十多亩地），锥成一眼新井（可浇二十多亩地），打成五眼土井，装好两架水车，另外还新修七间砖房，作为扩大饲养牲畜的房屋。这样就使十八亩丰产地和三十亩旱地都变成了水田，打下了增产的基础。吕鸿宾社主要解决了深耕的问题。因他们社的土质较硬，不易深耕，因此影响产量的继续提高。今春社员们想出了用“重犁”的办法深耕，一般可以耕到七寸到八寸，解决了这个问题。这三个社因为针对各自的具体情况，想出了增产办法，因而对完成今年的爱国增产竞赛计划，都有很高的信心。
