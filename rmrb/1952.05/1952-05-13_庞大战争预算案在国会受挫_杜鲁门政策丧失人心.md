Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: The setbacks encountered in Congress by Truman's unprecedentedly large war budget during peacetime demonstrate that the Truman administration's war policy has lost credibility in recent years.

In January of this year, Truman submitted a massive budget of $85.4 billion to Congress, of which direct military expenditures for the Army, Navy, and Air Force accounted for approximately $52 billion. In March, Truman separately submitted a so-called "Mutual Security" budget to Congress, requesting an appropriation of $7.9 billion for the next fiscal year starting July 1, 1952, to accelerate the arms expansion of satellite countries. However, as soon as Truman's budget was proposed, many Democratic and Republican members of Congress rushed to express their intention to make substantial cuts, including Connally, who had consistently advocated for Truman's policies in Congress. To defend his budget, Truman mobilized all the major heads of the government's military, political, and economic sectors to testify before Congress, desperately clamoring about the so-called "Soviet threat of aggression" and adopting various methods to increase the atmosphere of tension, from ordering government departments to prepare for "contingencies" to creating new tensions in the Korean armistice negotiations.

However, despite all these methods used by the Truman administration, the U.S. Congress successively passed several proposals to cut the budget. First, the House Appropriations Committee decided in early April to cut the direct military budget by $4.2 billion. Then, when the House of Representatives passed this budget, it was further reduced by $470 million. The House also passed an amendment limiting the total amount of government military spending for the next fiscal year to no more than $46 billion. This is equivalent to a reduction of $6 billion. The budget for the so-called "Mutual Security" plan encountered the same situation, with the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate successively deciding to cut $1 billion.

Currently, the U.S. budget is still being debated in Congress, and the expenditure figures have not yet been finalized. Although these "savings" measures by members of Congress are to a large extent just political tricks of the election year, the fact that the government budget has been so substantially reduced sharply illustrates how unpopular Truman's policy of arms expansion and war preparation for the purpose of foreign aggression has become in the United States.

The Korean War caused unprecedented military defeat for the United States and greatly reduced its international prestige. The much-touted rearmament efforts in Western Europe are also fraught with difficulties. Domestically, direct military spending has increased by about three times in two years, and the people's tax burden has increased by nearly two-thirds. As a result of the frenzied implementation of arms programs, the peace economy has contracted, prices have soared, and the unemployment problem has become increasingly serious. The arms race has reached such an intensity that even many representatives of the American bourgeoisie are warning of the danger of a collapse of the American economy.

Under these circumstances, the "Truman Doctrine" has become one of the most hated terms in the United States. Not only has Truman himself been forced to announce that he will no longer participate in the presidential election, but even Connally has had to abandon his ambition to continue occupying the congressional seat he has held for thirty-five years because of his deep connection to Truman's policies. According to the American "Newsweek," Connally had to make this "painful decision" because, after conducting an investigation, he knew that his district "opposed anyone who proved to be with Truman." "Newsweek" said: "Connally has tried hard to extricate himself from the relationship with the (Truman) government. From a supporter of Truman's foreign policy, he has become a sharp critic. But it's no use." Another American bourgeois magazine, "Time," reported on Connally's decision to give up his candidacy for senator, saying that his opponent's campaign was very successful because it "exploited Connally's ties to Truman and Acheson."

### 庞大战争预算案在国会受挫  杜鲁门政策丧失人心

    庞大战争预算案在国会受挫
    杜鲁门政策丧失人心
    【新华社九日讯】杜鲁门提出的美国和平时期空前庞大的战争预算在国会中遭遇的挫折，说明了近年来杜鲁门政府的战争政策业已威信扫地。
    杜鲁门在今年一月向国会提出了一个八百五十四亿美元的庞大预算，其中陆、海、空三军开支直接军费就约占五百二十亿。三月间，杜鲁门又向国会单独提出所谓“共同安全”预算，要求在一九五二年七月一日起的下年度中拨款七十九亿美元，作为加紧仆从国家扩军之用。但是杜鲁门的这一预算刚刚提出，国会中民主、共和两党许多议员就争先恐后表示要予以大量削减，在这些议员中间包括在国会中一贯为杜鲁门政策鼓吹的康纳利。杜鲁门为保卫他的预算，动员了政府所有军事、政治、经济方面的主要首脑到国会作证，竭力叫嚷所谓苏联的“侵略威胁”，并且采取各种增加紧张空气的办法，从下令政府各部门作“应变”准备一直到在朝鲜停战谈判中制造新的紧张局面。
    但是尽管杜鲁门政府用了这一切办法，美国国会仍然先后通过了几个削减预算的提案。首先是众议院拨款委员会在四月初决定把直接军费预算削减四十二亿，接着，在众议院全体会议通过这个预算案时，又再削减了四亿七千万。众议院还通过了一个修正案，把下年度政府军事开支的总数限定不得超过四百六十亿的总数。这样就等于削减了六十亿。所谓“共同安全”计划的预算也遇到同样情形，参众两院外交委员会已先后决定削减十亿。
    现在，美国的预算案还在国会继续辩论中，其支出数字尚未最后确定，尽管国会议员们的这种“节约”措施在很大的程度上不过是大选年的政治把戏。但是，政府预算案之如此被大量削减仍然尖锐地说明了杜鲁门的以对外侵略为目的的扩军备战政策在美国已如何不得人心。
    朝鲜战争使美国在军事上遭到空前的失败，大大降低了美国的国际威信。大吹大擂的西欧备战工作也是困难丛生。在国内，直接军事开支两年中间增加了大约三倍，人民的捐税负担增加了近三分之二。由于疯狂地推行军备计划的结果，和平经济萎缩，物价高涨，失业问题日益严重。军备运动进行到了这样的强度，以至连美国资产阶级的许多代表都警告有使美国经济崩溃的危险。
    在这种情况下，“杜鲁门政策”在美国已成为最受人讨厌的名词之一。不仅杜鲁门本人已因此被迫宣告不再参加总统竞选，而且连康纳利也因为与杜鲁门政策关系太深而不得不放弃继续占据他已坐了三十五年的国会议席的野心。按照美国“新闻周刊”解释，康纳利之所以不得不作出这个“痛苦的决定”，是因为他在作过一番调查之后，知道他的选区“反对任何证明和杜鲁门在一起的人”。“新闻周刊”说：“康纳利曾经竭力试图解脱自己和
    （杜鲁门）政府的关系。从一个杜鲁门外交政策的支持者，他变成了一个尖刻的批评者。但是已没有用了。”另一美国资产阶级杂志“时代”在报道康纳利决定放弃竞选参议员的决定时说，他的对手竞选非常成功，就是靠“利用康纳利和杜鲁门、艾奇逊的瓜葛”。
