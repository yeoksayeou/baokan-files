To the Editor:

    Village cadres in Dongguan Town, Qixian County, Third District, Shanxi Province, in promoting new agricultural tools, did not first let the masses understand the benefits of the new agricultural tools before promoting them; instead, they adopted a simple quota method to force the masses to buy them, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

    The village cadres planned for the whole village to buy four 5-inch walking plows, one sprayer, and nine thermometers, and then distributed these numbers to nine "lu" (a local administrative unit). They assigned the seventh "lu" to buy one walking plow, and that "lu" then divided it equally among the households, with each household paying 2,000 yuan. The third "lu" bought one walking plow, which was allocated based on population, with each person over the age of fourteen paying 2,000 yuan and each person under the age of fourteen paying 1,000 yuan. The fourth "lu" bought one walking plow, which was allocated based on labor and animal power, with each laborer paying 20% of the amount in cash, and the remainder to be repaid after the autumn harvest. The masses are all dissatisfied with this approach by the village cadres. We believe it should be quickly corrected.

    山西祁县三区东观镇村干部
    应纠正推广新式农具中的摊派现象
    编辑同志：祁县三区东观镇村干部推广新式农具，不是先让群众了解新式农具的好处，然后再进行推广；而是采取了简单的摊派的方法，强迫群众购买，引起群众不满。
    该村干部计划全村购买五吋步犁四张、喷雾器一架、温度计九个，就把这些数字分配给九个闾。他们分配七闾买步犁一张，该闾就按户平均分摊，每户出现款二千元。三闾买步犁一张，是按人口摊派，十四岁以上每人出二千元，十四岁以下每人出一千元。四闾买步犁一张，是按劳畜力摊派，每个劳力缴百分之二十的现款，其余秋后再还。群众对村干部这种做法都不满意。我们认为应该迅速纠正。
