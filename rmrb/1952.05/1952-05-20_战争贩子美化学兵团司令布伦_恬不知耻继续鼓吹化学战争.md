Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 19th: TASS Washington, May 19th—At the annual meeting of the Chemical Society of the Armed Forces held in Chicago, Brigadier General Brennan, Commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, delivered a speech praising chemical weapons as "cheap," "powerful," and not causing permanent damage to property.

Brennan said: Now, the United States is the most advanced industrial country in the world, and our chemical industry is the largest in our entire industry. "This industrial potential and chemical warfare offers us enormous possibilities..."

Brennan continued: Chemical weapons are weapons for killing human beings. However, apart from incendiary bombs, these weapons are generally not destructive. Chemical weapons are cheap, powerful, and do not cause permanent damage to property. They can do things that destructive weapons cannot. Destructive weapons can penetrate armor, but chemical weapons can penetrate deep into armor. Underground fortifications and shelters, unless protected by sophisticated and complete ventilation equipment, can also be deeply penetrated by chemical weapons.

From Brennan's remarks, it can be seen that the American man-eating savages in general's uniforms are becoming more and more arrogant and embarrassing themselves more and more. All the people know the crimes these man-eating savages have recently committed: intervening in Korea and committing atrocities; using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China; carrying out bloody revenge on prisoners of war on Geoje Island; and shamelessly promoting chemical weapons.

    战争贩子美化学兵团司令布伦
    恬不知耻继续鼓吹化学战争
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：美国陆军化学兵团司令布伦少将在芝加哥举行的武装部队化学学会年会上发表演说，称赞化学武器“成本便宜”、“效力强大”、而且不会使财物遭受永久性的损害。
    布伦说：现在，美国是世界上最先进的工业国家，我们的化学工业在我们的全部工业中是最大的工业。“这种工业潜力与化学战争对我们提供了巨大的可能性……”
    布伦继称：化学武器是杀伤人类的武器。然而，除去烧夷弹以外，这种武器一般不是破坏性的武器。化学武器成本便宜，效力强大，而且不会使财物遭受永久性的损害。它可以做到破坏性武器所做不到的事。破坏性武器可以突破铁甲，化学武器却可以深入铁甲。地下工事和避弹室，除非有巧妙的、完整的通风装置的保护，也同样可以被化学武器深深地打进去。
    由布伦的谈话中可以看出，穿着将官制服的美国吃人生番越来越狂妄，越来越使自己丢脸了。全体人民都知道这些吃人生番最近犯下的罪行：在朝鲜进行干涉，干出暴行；在朝鲜和中国东北使用细菌武器；对巨济岛上的战俘进行血腥的报复；无耻地宣传化学武器。
