    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    Peterhof near Leningrad is Under Construction
    Peterhof near Leningrad is a famous 18th-century Russian building. During the Soviet Patriotic War, it was deliberately destroyed by the Hitlerite bandits. However, after large-scale construction work in recent years, the appearance of Peterhof has become unrecognizable. Its famous fountains are spraying water again, and the beautiful park has been completely restored. This scenic area has once again become a popular vacation spot for the working people of Leningrad.
    A beautiful three-story building with a high tower stands on a scenic hill in Strelna Park. This is the reconstructed Konstantinovsky Palace. The restoration of its building is nearing completion. All the magnificent vaults, eaves, and other decorations have been rebuilt according to their original forms.
    The speed of repairing the famous product of Russian architecture - the Grand Palace is increasing every day.
    Peter the Great's Summer Palace is being rebuilt. The classical paintings in its central hall are about to be restored.
    Romanian Workers' Peace Labor Brigades
    Romanian workers express their determination to defend the cause of peace by forming peace labor brigades.
    These peace labor brigades are widely established in factories, mines, and enterprises throughout the country, and are named after famous peace fighters such as Joliot-Curie, Fadeyev, Guo Moruo, and Amado. These peace labor brigades play a significant role in increasing labor productivity, increasing output, and striving to complete the Five-Year Plan. For example, the "Fadeyev" brigade in the "November 7th" factory in Bucharest exceeded the production plan by 7% to 9% in the first quarter of the second year (1952) of the Five-Year Plan. This brigade has now produced six Stakhanovite workers.
    In order to promote the advanced production methods of outstanding peace labor brigades, the Bucharest Peace Committee recently organized a conference to exchange experiences. Representatives of various peace labor brigades reported on their working methods, their insights into learning from the experience of Soviet Stakhanovite workers, and their achievements in production. Many representatives also expressed their determination to continuously improve their work and strengthen the strength of the motherland and the world peace camp with their production achievements.
    Production Achievements of a Bulgarian Paint Factory
    The "Andrei Yulukov" paint factory in Iskar, Bulgaria, has already completed the Five-Year Plan in three years and three months in the first quarter of this year, ahead of schedule. Workers' labor productivity has increased by 366% compared to 1948, and the output of paint products has increased twenty times compared to before the factory was nationalized. On the day of completing the plan, all the workers of the factory excitedly telegraphed Comrade Chervenkov, their beloved leader, to report the good news.
    During the period from 1950 to 1951 and the first quarter of 1952, the workers created many methods to improve work and put forward many rationalization proposals, thereby saving the state a total of 11.4 million leva (Bulgarian currency).
    In order to congratulate the workers on their achievements in completing the production plan ahead of schedule, Comrade Chervenkov sent a special telegram to the factory, encouraging the workers to work better and continue to achieve new achievements.
    Soviet Books in Czechoslovakia
    Learning from the Soviet Union has become a common desire and demand of the Czechoslovak people. Translations of various Soviet books have a large readership in Czechoslovakia. In the past year alone, 21 million copies of translations of various Soviet books were sold, an average of about two copies per person.
    Since the Czech and Slovak languages are very close to Russian, and hundreds of thousands of Czechoslovak people have learned Russian, the demand for Russian books is also very high. Last year, a total of 1.5 million copies of Russian books were sold, about double the number in 1950. The "Short Course on the History of the CPSU(B)" has been published in 551,000 copies; Lenin's works have been published in 572,000 copies; and the first six volumes of Stalin's works have been published in 860,000 copies.
    The Czechoslovak people also have a great need for Soviet technical and scientific books. Labor models and technical inventors actively study these books and often find the path to their achievements in these books.
    Czech and Slovak translations of Soviet literary and artistic works sold a total of 5 million copies last year. Gorky's "Mother" was only published in 3,000 copies before the war, but now it has increased to 172,000 copies. "Far from Moscow," by the famous Soviet young writer Azhayev, has sold 231,000 copies, and another 115,000 copies are now being printed.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    列宁格勒近郊名胜彼得宫在修建中
    列宁格勒近郊的彼得宫，是十八世纪俄国著名的建筑物。在苏联卫国战争期间，曾经遭受到希特勒匪帮的蓄意破坏。但是，经过最近几年来的大规模的修建工作，彼得宫的面貌，已变得不能辨认了。它的著名的喷泉又在喷水，美丽的公园已经完全修复。这一个名胜地区又成为列宁格勒劳动人民常去的休假的地方了。
    伸出一座美丽的高塔来的一所三层楼房屋，在斯特列尔纳公园的一座风景幽美的小山上屹立着。这是重建的康斯坦丁诺夫斯基宫。它的大厦的修复工作将近完成。一切华丽的拱顶和屋檐以及其他装饰，都是依照它们的原来的形式重建的。
    俄罗斯建筑上著名的产物——大宫的修理速度每天都在增加。
    彼得一世的夏宫正在重建。它的中央大厅里的古典绘画即将修复完成。
    罗马尼亚工人的和平劳动工作队
    罗马尼亚工人以成立和平劳动工作队的方式，来表示他们保卫和平事业的决心。
    这些和平劳动工作队在全国各地工厂、矿坑和企业中广泛成立起来，并以约里奥—居里、法捷耶夫、郭沫若和亚马多等著名和平战士的名字命名。在提高劳动生产率、提高产量和争取完成五年计划的斗争中，这些和平劳动工作队起着很大的作用。例如在布加勒斯特的“诺恩勃莱第七”工厂里的“法捷耶夫”工作队，在五年计划第二年（一九五二年）第一季的生产中，超额完成了生产计划的百分之七至百分之九。这个工作队现在已经产生了六位斯达哈诺夫工作者。
    为了推广优秀的和平劳动工作队的先进生产方法，布加勒斯特和平委员会最近组织了一次交流经验的会议。各个和平劳动工作队的代表在会上报告了他们的工作方法，学习苏联斯达哈诺夫工作者经验的心得和他们在生产中所获得的成就。许多代表并且表示决心要不断改进他们的工作，用生产的成绩来加强祖国与世界和平阵营的力量。
    保加利亚一个油漆工厂的生产成就
    保加利亚伊萨卡尔地方的“安德里·尤路科夫”油漆工厂已经在今年第一季以三年又三个月的时间，提前完成了五年计划。工人们的劳动生产率比
    一九四八年增加了百分之三百六十六，油漆制品的产量已较该厂国有化前增加了二十倍。在完成计划的那一天，该厂的全体工人怀着兴奋的心情用电报向他们敬爱的领袖契尔文科夫同志报告了这个喜讯。
    在一九五○年、一九五一年两年和一九五二年第一季这一段时期内，由于工人们创造了许多改进工作的方法，提出了许多合理化建议，因而总共为国家节省了一千一百四十万利瓦（保币）的支出。
    为了祝贺工人们提前完成生产计划的成就，契尔文科夫同志特地致电该厂，鼓舞工人们更好地工作，继续取得新的成就。
    苏联书籍在捷克斯洛伐克
    学习苏联已成为捷克斯洛伐克人民的普遍愿望和要求。苏联各种书籍的译本在捷有着广大的读者。仅去年一年内，苏联各种书籍的译本就销售了二千一百万册，平均每一个人约有两册。
    由于捷克和斯洛伐克的文字都很接近俄文，并且已有数十万捷克斯洛伐克人民学会了俄文，所以人民对于俄文书籍的需要也很大。去年俄文书籍共销售了一百五十万册，较一九五○年约增加一倍。“联共（布）党史简明教程”已发行了五十五万一千册；列宁的作品已发行了五十七万二千册；斯大林作品的前六卷已发行了八十六万册。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民也非常需要苏联的技术和科学方面的书籍。劳动模范和技术发明者积极地学习这些书本，并且常从这些书里找到他们创造成绩的道路。
    苏联文学艺术作品的捷克文和斯洛伐克文译本，在去年一年内共销售了五百万册。高尔基的“母亲”在战前只发行三千册，现在已增加到十七万二千册。苏联著名青年作家阿绥叶夫的“远离莫斯科的地方”已销售了二十三万一千册，现在又有十一万五千册在印制中。
