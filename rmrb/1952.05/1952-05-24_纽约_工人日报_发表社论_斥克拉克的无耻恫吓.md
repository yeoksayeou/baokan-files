Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 23rd: The New York "Daily Worker" published an editorial on April 16th, severely condemning General Clark's intimidating statement that he would take "tough" measures against prisoners of war on Geoje Island, and his attempt to break the promises made by Dodd and Colson. The editorial said: "Since General Clark has placed his flamethrowing tanks before defenseless prisoners of war and still has not been able to scare them... then what other methods does Clark have to cover up the ugly lie of his manufactured 'anti-communist prisoners'? Dodd agreed to stop forced screening. Clark says he does not intend to fulfill Dodd's promise. So, what does he intend to do? Strengthen the atrocities against prisoners of war, forcing them to become 'evidence' to delay the Panmunjom armistice negotiations?"

"These brutal actions of General Clark can no longer conceal the scandal on Geoje Island; the whole world has already seen the truth of the matter. Now, the American people should realize how this panic-stricken military group is disregarding the interests and happiness of the American people. Their suppression of the prisoners of war on Geoje Island is, in fact, equivalent to suppressing the American people's desire for peace. Now is the time for the American people to begin putting pressure on those who are obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations."

Pittman, the foreign news editor of the New York "Daily Worker," wrote an editorial in the paper on the 14th, saying: "The recent Geoje Island incident has revealed how the militarists in the Pentagon are illegally and barbarically treating prisoners of war under the pretext of the lie of 'voluntary repatriation.'" He said: "What is the purpose of this 'voluntary repatriation' lie? Clearly, they intend to give Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek more manpower, which Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek do not need if Washington truly hopes to reach an armistice agreement. The fact that Washington is now using this issue to hinder the entire armistice negotiations is enough to convict American military personnel and politicians of being war criminals attempting to expand the Korean War."

    纽约“工人日报”发表社论
    斥克拉克的无耻恫吓
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】四月十六日的纽约“工人日报”发表社论，对克拉克将军表示要对巨济岛战俘采取“强硬”手段的恫吓性声明，以及他想撕毁杜德和柯尔生的诺言的企图，痛加斥责。社论说：“既然克拉克将军把他的火焰喷射坦克摆在毫无抵抗能力的战俘眼前，尚且没有能够吓倒他们……那么，克拉克还有什么办法来掩饰他所制造的‘反共的俘虏’的丑恶谎话呢？杜德同意了停止进行强迫甄别。克拉克说，他不打算实现杜德的诺言。那么，他打算怎样办呢？打算加强对战俘的暴行，逼迫他们成为拖延板门店停战谈判的‘证据’吗？
    “克拉克将军这些残暴的行动，再也遮掩不住巨济岛的丑事了；全世界都已经看到事件的真相。现在，美国人民应该认识得到，这惊慌失措的军事集团是怎样无视美国人民的利益和幸福。他们镇压巨济岛的战俘，事实上即等于压制美国人民对和平的渴望。现在，是美国人民开始对那些妨碍朝鲜停战谈判的人施用压力的时候了。”
    纽约“工人日报”国外新闻编辑皮特曼十四日在该报上撰写社论说：“最近的巨济岛事件，揭露了五角大楼的军国主义者如何以“自愿遣返”的谎话为藉口而非法地野蛮地对待战俘。”他说：“这种
    ‘自愿遣返’的谎话，目的何在呢？显然，他们是打算给予李承晚和蒋介石更多的人力，而如果华盛顿真正希望取得停战协议，李承晚和蒋介石是不需要这些人的。华盛顿现在利用这个问题来妨碍整个停战谈判，这个事实就足以判定美国军人和政客是企图扩大朝鲜战争的战犯。”
