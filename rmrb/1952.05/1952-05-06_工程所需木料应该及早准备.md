    Lumber for Projects Should Be Prepared Early
    Comrade Editor: In early January of this year, the Forestry Science Department of Wufeng County, Hubei Province, assigned us the task of felling and transporting 50,000 Chinese fir logs needed for the Jingjiang River Diversion Project, with a deadline of the end of January. Because of the tight schedule, we started transporting the lumber immediately after felling it, without waiting for it to dry. Wet lumber is twice as heavy as dry lumber, making transportation difficult. If this lumber is bundled into rafts, it will sink in the water (some has already sunk), unlike dry lumber which can float. If transported by boat, the high shipping cost is a secondary concern; the important issue is that the river channels are small, and the boats are also small, with limited carrying capacity, making it impossible to complete the task by the end of the month. Not to mention the waste of manpower and resources, and the increased costs, the transportation alone is estimated to cost 300 million yuan more than transporting dry lumber. If calculated based on the 200,000 Chinese fir logs task assigned to the Yichang Prefecture, the extra cost would be over 1 billion yuan.
    The above situation tells us that when constructing a certain project, a comprehensive plan must be made early, and the required timber must be arranged in the production area in advance to avoid temporary chaos and losses. Relevant departments should at least understand the situation in the timber production area and the time it takes for lumber to dry after felling.
    The loss caused by transporting lumber in January was already a very clear lesson, but the relevant parties did not pay attention to it. Therefore, at the end of March this year, the Hubei Provincial People's Government instructed our county to purchase pine pit props and transport them to Hankou by the end of May. However, pine wood must be dried for more than two and a half months after being felled, which will inevitably lead to a waste of manpower and resources.
    I believe that future construction projects across the country will be larger and more numerous, and the demand for timber will also increase. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant authorities pay attention to the issue of preparing lumber early.    Liu Mingduo

### 工程所需木料应该及早准备

    工程所需木料应该及早准备
    编辑同志：今年一月初，湖北省五峰县农林科分配给我们砍伐和运送荆江分洪工程所需的五万根杉木的任务，并限令一月底完成。因为时间紧迫，我们把木料砍伐下来后，没有等它干，就开始运送了。湿木料比干木料体重一倍，运送困难。这些木料若扎成木排，放到水里就沉下去了（已经沉下去了一些），不能像干木料那样能浮在水面；若用船装，装运费贵还是次要的事，重要的问题是河道小，船只也小，载重量不多，到月底完不成任务。不说浪费人力物力，加高了成本，单运输一项，计算起来就比运送干木料多费了三亿元。若按宜昌专区负担的二十万根杉木的任务来计算，多化的费用当在十亿元以上。
    以上所说的事情告诉我们：建筑某一工程时，必须早有通盘计划，把需用木材提前布置到产区，以免临时手忙脚乱，造成损失。有关部门至少也应了解木材产区情况，及木料砍伐下来从湿到干所需的时间。
    一月份因运送木料造成损失的事，本来是很明显的教训，而有关方面对此并未加以注意。因此，在今年三月末，湖北省人民政府又指令在我县采购松坑木，限五月底运到汉口。可是松木砍下来以后，必须经过两个半月以上时间才能干，这样势必又要造成人力物力的浪费。
    我觉得今后全国的工程建设将更大更多，需要的木材也会更多，因此我建议有关机关注意及早准备木料的问题。    刘明铎
