Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th. Our special correspondent reports: Today, the US side's chief representative, Joye, desperately but feebly continued to cling to the US propaganda deception, saying that "prisoners of war have the freedom to refuse repatriation." In fact, this deception has been completely exposed by the demands made by captured Korean and Chinese personnel on Geoje Island.

The demands made by the prisoners of war for the release of Dodd, which have been published by Clark, Leechway's successor in Tokyo. Although these demands have been tampered with and distorted, they have already tolled the death knell for the US propaganda deception of "100,000 prisoners refusing repatriation" and the US "willing to sacrifice the armistice for this issue." Clark's statement is undeniable proof of the ugly farce of "voluntary repatriation" and "non-forced repatriation" created by the US in the prisoner of war camps on Geoje Island. The simple and solemn demands of the captured Korean and Chinese personnel allow the world to glimpse the grim situation of massacres and violent actions on the island. This will expose the true colors of Leechway's and Truman's so-called "humane and moral" treatment of prisoners of war, proving it to be a complete lie.

Our captured personnel's four demands and Coelson's reply irrefutably prove that the United States has continuously created violence and bloodshed on Geoje Island. If Joye continues to promote the so-called "individual fair freedom of will of prisoners of war" every day, he cannot help but appear extremely foolish. According to American sources, Joye "seems to be more annoyed than at any time since the ten months of fruitless negotiations, as far as journalists can remember." The reason is that Joye cannot stand in the face of the ironclad fact presented by General Nan Ri - "In your prisoner of war camps, our captured personnel have no freedom to express their free will, and only you have the freedom to use force against our captured personnel at will."

Observers point out that Joye's rage and loss of self-control at the open delegation meeting was due to his inability to fend off the fatal blow to the propaganda carried out by the US both inside and outside the meeting tent. At one delegation meeting, Joye got up and walked away even before General Nan Ri had finished speaking. Obviously, Joye does not like open meetings, because open meetings subject the statements of both parties to public opinion. In the past, secret meetings had enabled him to violate the agreement and use one-sided propaganda published by Tokyo and Washington to confuse public opinion.

Observers point out that the climax of the US side's bluffing and threats is precisely when the US negotiating representatives have reached a dead end because their own propaganda has gone bankrupt. The whole world has seen Joye desperately clinging to the US requirement of so-called "no forced repatriation," although this deception has been shattered by the demands of the Geoje Island prisoners of war and exposed by the confessions of his superiors in Tokyo. Acting camp commander Coelson agreed to "fully comply with the terms of the Geneva Convention" in accordance with the demands of the prisoners of war, but Joye blatantly violated the terms of the Geneva Convention every day, insisting on detaining 100,000 prisoners of war.

The US side's "final and unchangeable plan" of April 28th has gone bankrupt. Joye's only way out is to admit that this plan has gone bankrupt and face a final and unchangeable fact: The Korean and Chinese representatives have already taken the final decisive step on May 2nd to break the deadlock. The next step depends on the US negotiating representatives. The sooner they recognize this fact, the sooner the armistice in Korea can be achieved.

### 巨济岛我方被俘人员提出的要求彻底揭穿了乔埃的“自愿遣返”骗局

    巨济岛我方被俘人员提出的要求彻底揭穿了乔埃的“自愿遣返”骗局
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者报道：美方首席代表乔埃今天拚命地但又无力地继续死抓住美方的宣传骗局不放，说什么“战俘有拒绝遣返的自由”。其实这个骗局已被传出来的巨济岛上朝中被俘人员所提的要求彻底拆穿了。
    战俘为释放杜德而提出的要求业经李奇微在东京的继任人克拉克发表。这些要求虽经删改和歪曲，但是也已为美方所作的“十万战俘拒绝遣返”、美方“愿为这个问题而牺牲停战”等宣传骗局敲起了丧钟。克拉克的声明就是美方在巨济岛战俘营中制造“自愿遣返”与“不强迫遣返”的丑剧的死也抵赖不了的证据。朝中被俘人员的简单而严正的要求，使全世界得以一睹岛上屠杀与暴力行动的阴森景况。这一来，可使李奇微和杜鲁门所谓的对战俘以“人道和道德为怀”的言论原形毕露，证明是个弥天大谎。
    我方被俘人员的四项要求和柯尔生的答复，无可辩驳地证明了美国在巨济岛不断地制造暴力和流血事件，已使乔埃如果再继续天天宣传所谓“战俘的个人公正自由意志”，就不能不显得异常愚蠢。据美国消息说，乔埃“就新闻记者记忆所及，似乎比十个月无结果的谈判以来任何时候都更为恼怒”。其原因即在于此，在南日将军提出的铁一般的事实——“在你方战俘营内，我方被俘人员毫无表示自由意志的自由，只有你方有任意对我方被俘人员施用武力的自由”——面前，乔埃站不住脚了。
    观察家指出，乔埃所以在公开的代表团大会上暴跳如雷、失去自制力，是由于他无力挡开美方在会议帐篷内外进行的宣传所遭受的致命打击。在一次代表团大会上，甚至在南日将军还没有发言完毕的时候，乔埃就起来走开了。很显然，乔埃不喜欢公开会议，因为公开会议使双方的发言受到舆论的监督。在过去，秘密会议曾经使他能够违反协定，由东京和华盛顿发表片面的宣传言论来迷惑舆论。
    观察家指出，美方的虚张声势和威胁的高潮，正是在美方谈判代表因为自己的宣传破产而走头无路的时候。全世界都看到乔埃拚命抓住美方关于所谓“不得强行遣返”的要求不放，虽然这种骗局已经被巨济岛战俘的要求击破了，并且被他在东京的上司的供状揭穿了。在俘虏营代理长官柯尔生依照战俘的要求答应“完全遵照日内瓦公约的条款”，但乔埃却天天公然破坏日内瓦公约的条款，坚持扣留十万名战俘。
    美方四月二十八日的“最后而不可改变的方案”已经破产了。乔埃的唯一出路就是承认这一方案已经破产，并且正视一个最后而不可改变的事实：朝中代表已经在五月二日采取了最后的决定性的步骤来打破僵局。下一步就看美国谈判代表了。他们早一天承认这一个事实，朝鲜的停战就能早一天实现。
