Visiting the Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha of Longwu Monastery in Qinghai
    Li Yi
    The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha of Longwu Monastery in Tongren County, Qinghai, is thirty-three years old this year and a talkative person. In 1950, he traveled to Lhasa to work for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Recently, he came to Beijing from Qinghai to visit, and I visited him at his residence. When I visited him, he warmly grasped my hands with both hands, according to Tibetan custom. He said that he was very happy to come to Beijing, see the people's leader Chairman Mao, and see the great construction of the motherland. He said that Tibetan compatriots compared Chairman Mao to the sun shining into the deep mountains and forests, and the sun dispelled the deep suffering of the Tibetan people. This metaphor aptly, profoundly, and vividly depicts the past and present of the Tibetan people.
    The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha excitedly told me that the Tongren County Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government was officially established on March 22nd this year. The Tibetan people have a government led by cadres of their own ethnicity. This is an earth-shattering change. This marks the unity of the Tibetan people with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, and also marks the Tibetan people's complete and equal rights with all ethnic groups.
    The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha said that in the nearly three years since liberation, incidents of mutual looting and killing between Tibetan tribes in Tongren County have disappeared. The grassland dispute between the Jiawu tribe in Tongren County and the Ganjia tribe in Xiahe, Gansu, which had not been resolved for thirty-five years, was satisfactorily resolved in October 1950 through fair mediation by the People's Government. This incident gave the Tibetan people a clear revelation. In the past long years, for the sake of cattle and sheep grazing and drinking water, blood had been shed on the grasslands from Aji Da Dangni in the west to the banks of the Palang Nanpan Saiqing River in the east. More than seventy Tibetan people were innocently sacrificed. Now the Tibetan compatriots understand that this was deliberately created by reactionaries such as Chiang Kai-shek and Ma Bufang. The reactionaries have always applauded the infighting among Tibetan compatriots, calling it a "great happy event" because it is very beneficial to their rule and extortion. The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha said that these bandits often put on a "mediation" face in front of Tibetan compatriots, but they were not actually mediating, but were trying to expand the disputes in every possible way. Ma Bufang once gave the Jiawu tribe guns, cannons, and bullets to instigate them to kill the Tibetan compatriots of the Ganjia tribe; he once instigated a person named Jiu Se'er from the Maixiu tribe to rob everywhere in order to expand the disputes between the various ethnic groups. Every time Jiu Se'er returned from robbing, he would receive a "reward" of one or two thousand silver dollars from Ma Bufang. The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha said that now, after education by facts, Tibetan compatriots have seen through the conspiracy of the reactionaries and know that there is no hatred between their tribes; all the so-called hatred is created by the reactionaries. Due to this awakening, this spring, the Tibetan compatriots in Tongren County have taken the initiative to propose resolving the dispute between the Ga'erze tribe and the Suhu tribe in Tongde County. The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha said that after the satisfactory resolution of the armed fighting dispute between the Jiawu and Ganjia tribes, the boundaries for grazing and drinking water have now been broken for many years; it is safe to transport grain and do business in the agricultural area. Abundant water and grass, and strong cattle and sheep have become a sign of the increasingly upward economic trend in the Tibetan pastoral areas.
    Our conversation turned to the most prominent wool problem in Qinghai.
    Speaking of wool, the Tibetan people had endless grievances in the past. The Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha said that during the Ma Bufang rule, every hundred catties of wool was worth at most fourteen or five silver dollars, and at least it had dropped to four silver dollars, and it had to be sold unconditionally to Ma Bufang's Dexinghai store. This is simply no different from robbery. After liberation, the situation has completely changed. The People's Government has formulated fair and reasonable purchase prices, and the Tibetan people can sell one million RMB for every hundred catties of wool. This is something that the Tibetan people never dreamed of before.
    Speaking of the culture and education of the Tibetan people, the Xia Ri Cang Living Buddha was extremely excited. He said that before liberation, the Tibetan people in Tongren County had no opportunity to receive school education at all. At that time, there was only one Han-Hui primary school in the whole county, and Tibetan children could not get in even if they wanted to. Ma Bufang also expressed that he wanted to run schools for Tibetan compatriots, but Tibetan compatriots knew that he was not well-intentioned and unanimously refused. Ma Bufang took the opportunity to extort tens of thousands of silver dollars from Tibetan compatriots. Now, with the strong assistance of the People's Government, the Tibetan compatriots in Tongren County are building five primary schools. More than 140 Tibetan people have been sent by the People's Government to study in schools in Xining and other places. With the rise of economic life, learning culture has now become an urgent requirement of the Tibetan people.
    Just as our conversation was coming to an end, a soft "Che Leng" (i.e., horizontal flute) sound came from outside the room. This was a Tibetan folk tune played by a Tibetan farmer named Xiangba Dingzeng. The first sentence of this little tune is "Drink up the wine in the glass." This is a very beautiful song. Today, in their tents, whenever the moon is bright and the wind is clear, the Tibetan people sing to their heart's content and drink to their heart's content for their increasingly better life.

    访问青海隆务寺夏日仓活佛
    李翼
    青海同仁县隆务寺夏日仓活佛，今年三十三岁，是一位健谈的人。一九五○年他曾为西藏的和平解放，到拉萨奔走过。最近他由青海来到北京参观，我到他的住处访问了他。当我访问他时，他按照藏族的习惯，双手热情地紧握着我的手。他说，他来到北京，看到了人民领袖毛主席，看到了祖国的各项伟大建设，内心非常愉快。他说，藏区同胞把毛主席比做照进深山老林里的太阳，太阳驱散了藏族人民的深重苦难。这比喻恰切、深刻、生动地描绘了藏族人民的过去和现在。
    夏日仓活佛兴奋地告诉我，同仁县藏族自治区人民政府已在今年三月二十二日正式成立了。藏族人民有了由本族干部领导的政府。这是一个翻天覆地的大变化。这标志着藏族和国内各兄弟民族的团结一致，同时标志着藏族人民有了和各族人民完全平等的权利。
    夏日仓活佛说，解放近三年来，同仁县藏族部落间互相抢劫烧杀的事件已经没有了。同仁县藏族甲吾部落和甘肃夏河藏族甘加部落间三十五年不能解决的草山纠纷，经过人民政府的公平调解，在一九五○年十月圆满地解决了。这一事件，给了藏族人民一个鲜明的启示。在过去漫长的岁月里，藏族同胞间为着牛羊吃草、饮水的问题，西起阿吉达当尼，东至帕浪南畔赛庆河两岸的草山上，曾经遍洒鲜血。七十多位藏族人民无辜地牺牲了。现在藏族同胞懂得了：这正是反动派蒋介石、马步芳等故意制造的。反动派对于藏族同胞的自相残杀，一直是拍手叫好，称为“大喜事”。因为这对于他们的统治和敲榨勒索是非常有利的。夏日仓活佛说，这些匪帮常常在藏族同胞面前装出一付“调解”的面孔，但他们实际上并不是在调解，而是在百般设法扩大纠纷。马步芳曾经给甲吾部落以枪炮子弹，嗾使他们去杀甘加部落的藏族同胞；曾经嗾使麦秀部落的一个名久塞尔的人到处打劫，以扩大各族人民间的纠纷。久塞尔每次抢劫回来，都要受到马步芳一、二千块白洋的“犒赏”。夏日仓活佛说，现在经过事实的教育，藏族同胞识破了反动派的这一套阴谋诡计，知道了他们部落间本来没有什么仇恨；一切的所谓仇恨，都是反动派制造的。由于这种觉醒，今年春天，同仁县藏族同胞已主动地提出要解决尕尔泽部落和同德县苏呼部落间的纠纷了。夏日仓活佛说，甲吾、甘加两部落间械斗纠纷得到圆满解决之后，现在牛羊吃草、饮水，都打破了多年的界线；到农业区驮粮、做生意，路途上也平安无事了。水草丰裕，牛羊肥壮，成了藏族牧区经济日益向上的标志。
    我们的谈话转到青海最突出的羊毛问题上。
    提起羊毛，过去藏族人民是有说不尽的怨恨的。夏日仓活佛说，马步芳统治时期，每百斤羊毛至多值十四、五块白洋，最少时曾降到四块白洋，而且要无条件地卖给马步芳的德兴海商店。这简直无异于抢劫。解放后，情形完全改变了。人民政府订定了公平合理的收购价格，藏族人民每百斤羊毛，可卖得一百万元人民币。这是从前藏族人民做梦也想不到的。
    谈起藏族人民的文化教育，夏日仓活佛异常激动。他说，在解放前，同仁县藏族人民根本没有受学校教育的机会。那时全县只有一座汉回小学，藏族子弟是想进也进不去的。马步芳也曾经表示要给藏族同胞办学校，但藏族同胞都知道他不怀好意，一致表示拒绝。而马步芳却趁机向藏族同胞勒索了上万的白洋。现在，同仁县藏族同胞在人民政府大力协助下，正在修建着五所小学校。经过人民政府送到西宁等地学校学习的藏民，已有一百四十多人。随着经济生活的上升，学习文化现在已经成为藏族人民迫切的要求了。
    正当我们谈话结束的时候，室外传来了柔和的“撤冷”（即横笛）声。这是一位名叫祥巴丁曾的藏族农民所吹奏的一只藏区小调。这小调的第一句就是“把酒杯里的酒喝干”。这是一支很美丽的歌。今天，藏族人民在他们的帐篷里，每当月白风清的夜间，他们都要为今天日益美好的生活而尽情地歌唱，尽情地干杯。（附图片）
