Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 27th: American news agencies have published numerous reports revealing that the American aggressors, disregarding the angry protests of people worldwide, are intensifying their preparations for a new large-scale massacre of our captured personnel detained on Koje Island. After the commander of the US Eighth Army, Van Fleet, personally inspected the preparations for the massacre on Koje Island on the 22nd, the commander-in-chief of the American invading forces, Clark, brazenly declared on the 23rd that "General Van Fleet has authorized the guards to use concussion grenades, tear gas grenades" and so-called "riot control tactics" to conduct a more cruel and bloody suppression of our captured personnel, which the US has been planning for a long time.

To carry out this new large-scale massacre, the American aggressor army has assembled many troops on Koje Island to act as executioners. According to a report from the Associated Press in Seoul on the 24th, the US Eighth Army announced that the troops gathered on the island have "an armored infantry force, with combat strength only slightly less than that of an infantry division." The American paratroopers, described by the American aggressors as "valiant," are unscrupulously conducting intense massacre drills. According to a report from International News Service on Koje Island on the 23rd: "Soldiers held heavy tank exercises and bayonet drills in front of the prisoner-of-war camp." "American Patton tanks rumbled into an empty camp, knocking down the old walls of the barracks." "Infantry and paratroopers of the 187th Airborne Regiment waved their bayonets in areas where the Communist prisoners in some camps could clearly see them." American officers said that the US military would soon rush into the camps to carry out a bloody suppression of our captured personnel, "If the Communist prisoners resist, the United Nations forces will use tanks and, if necessary, flamethrowers." In addition, according to a report from Reuters in Tokyo on the 24th: "Tear gas has been prepared, machine guns have been loaded, and small bunkers have been built along the double barbed wire." An Associated Press report on the 23rd ominously announced: "The final showdown is approaching."

While making these new massacre preparations, the American aggressors are very insidiously creating rumors and deliberately spreading tension, creating excuses for their bloody massacre. A message issued by the Associated Press on the 26th said that our captured personnel under the strict imprisonment of the American aggressors "are creating a crudely equipped army," and devoted much space to so-called "estimates." However, even the rumor-mongers themselves cannot provide any specific basis. On the same day, United Press International also issued a similar message, saying that our captured personnel "have created a so-called Pittsburgh of Koje Island within the prisoner-of-war camp" (note: Pittsburgh is the center of the American steel industry) and other myths. The fact that the Associated Press and United Press International, two news agencies serving American imperialism, fabricated the same subject matter using the same methods on the same day is clearly not a coincidence, but part of the insidious plan of the American aggressors to create excuses in advance for a large-scale massacre of our captured personnel.

In order to strengthen the forces suppressing our captured personnel, and more importantly, to make its vassal states share the responsibility for the bloody massacre, the American aggressors have now transferred troops from Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Greece, and other countries under its control to Koje Island. According to an Associated Press report on the 26th: Bona, the head of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, told British and Canadian troops on the 26th that they could "shoot indiscriminately" and "use rifle butts and kick the lower abdomen" to treat our captured personnel. The report also admitted that the purpose of the United States dispatching troops from these vassal states to Koje Island was not only to "reinforce the guards here," but also to "give it an international character," or more clearly, to have the troops of these countries share the blame for the American bloody massacre, and to "give it an international character." Sources here emphasized that if the American aggressors dare to become enraged because of the failure of their conspiracy to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel and risk the condemnation of the world, and carry out new persecution and massacres of our captured personnel, then the American aggressors must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    美国侵略者阴谋大规模屠杀我被俘人员
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美国通讯社发表的许多新闻透露：美国侵略者不顾全世界人民的愤怒抗议，正在加紧准备对被拘留在巨济岛上的我方被俘人员进行新的大规模屠杀。在美国第八军军长范佛里特于二十二日亲自到巨济岛视察了美方进行屠杀的准备工作后，美国侵略军总司令克拉克在二十三日公然宣称“范佛里特将军已允许警卫人员使用震荡手榴弹、催泪毒气弹”和所谓“镇压暴动的战术”，来对我方被俘人员进行美方策划已久的更残酷的血腥镇压。
    为了进行这一新的大规模屠杀，美国侵略军已调集许多部队到巨济岛充当刽子手。据美联社汉城二十四日电透露：美国第八军宣布，集结在岛上的部队，已有“一个坦克步兵部队，实力仅稍逊于一个步兵师的作战实力”。被美国侵略者称为“剽悍”的美国伞兵正肆无忌惮地进行着紧张的屠杀操练。据国际新闻社巨济岛二十三日电称：“兵士们在俘虏场前面举行了重坦克演习和刺刀操练”。“美国的巴顿式坦克隆隆地开进一个空营场，撞倒了营房古老的墙壁”。“第一八七伞兵团的步兵和伞兵在一些营场中的共产党俘虏可以清楚地看得见的地方挥舞着他们的刺刀。”美国的军官们说，美军即将冲入营场，对我方被俘人员进行血腥镇压，“如果共产党俘虏进行抵抗，联合国军将调用坦克，必要时还要用喷火器。”除此之外，据路透社东京二十四日电透露：“催泪弹已准备好，机动机枪已上了子弹，小碉堡已沿双重的铁丝网建立起来。”美联社二十三日电已阴森森地宣布：“最后摊牌已更加迫近”。
    美国侵略者在进行这些新的大屠杀准备的同时，正在十分险毒地制造谣言并故意散布紧张空气，为他们进行血腥大屠杀制造藉口。美联社在二十六日发出的消息，说什么在美国侵略者严密监禁下的我方被俘人员“正在创立一支装备粗陋的军队”，并不惜篇幅作了许多所谓“估计”。但是连造谣者自己也提不出任何具体的根据。而合众社在同一天也发出类似的一条消息，说什么我方被俘人员“在战俘营内出现了所谓巨济岛的匹兹堡”（按匹兹堡为美国钢铁工业中心）等等神话。美联社和合众社这两个为美帝国主义服务的通讯社，在同一天用同样的手法编造了同样的题材，这显然不是什么偶然的巧合，而是美国侵略者阴险计划的一部分，即为大规模残杀我方被俘人员事先制造藉口。
    为了加强镇压我方被俘人员的力量，更重要的是为了使其仆从国家分担血腥屠杀的责任，现在美国侵略者已调动了在它控制下的英国、加拿大、荷兰、希腊等国的部队前往巨济岛。据美联社二十六日透露：巨济岛战俘营负责人波纳二十六日在向英国和加拿大军队讲话时，已指示他们可以“乱打”和“用步枪枪托、踢小肚子”来对待我方被俘人员。该消息同时承认美国调遣这些仆从国家的部队到巨济岛的目的除了是“增援此间的警卫队”外，另一目的是为了“使它带有国际色彩”，更清楚地说，也就是使这些国家的军队来分担美国血腥屠杀的罪责，而使之“带有国际色彩”。此间人士强调指出：美国侵略者如果竟敢因为它的企图强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的阴谋的破产，而恼羞成怒，甘冒天下之大不韪，对我被俘人员进行新的迫害和屠杀，那么由此而产生的一切严重后果，必须由美国侵略者负全部责任。
