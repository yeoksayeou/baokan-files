    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 11th: The All-India Cultural Circle Committee for Peace issued a statement on May 8th, the birthday of Tagore, the poet beloved by the Indian people, calling on the Indian people to commemorate him, paying particular attention to his writings promoting peace and his great contributions to the cause of peace.
    Tagore sternly rebuked the Japanese imperialist poet Noguchi, who attempted to defend the Japanese fascists' invasion of China in 1937. In 1941, on his eighty-first birthday, he issued a famous call from his sickbed against war and Western imperialism, expressing his firm belief in the victory of the Eastern peoples.
    Under the auspices of various cultural organizations, major Indian cities such as Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, and Delhi held song festivals, dances, recitations, and stage plays based on Tagore's works to commemorate his birthday.
    Newspapers in various languages published throughout India issued special editions to commemorate his birthday. Newspaper editorials unanimously called on the Indian people to remember his great legacy of love for humanity, his contribution to world peace, and his condemnation of the enemies of mankind and civilization.
    The Bengali daily "Liberty" in Calcutta published an editorial on May 8th stating: "Tagore's dream of a new awakening in China has now become a reality. The East, of which he was often proud, now stands among the 800 million people, including the Soviet Union and China. Hundreds of millions of people in the East are moving forward. They do not want war, they want peace, and they want a free and happy future."

    印度全国各地人民纪念泰戈尔诞辰
    【新华社新德里十一日电】五月八日是印度人民爱戴的诗人泰戈尔的诞辰，全印文化界争取和平委员会发表声明，号召印度人民进行纪念，特别重视他鼓吹和平的著作和他对和平事业的巨大贡献。
    泰戈尔曾严厉斥责企图替日本法西斯在一九三七年对中国发动进攻辩护的日本帝国主义诗人野口。在一九四一年他八十一岁诞辰时，他曾在病榻上发出反对战争、反对西方帝国主义的著名号召，并表示了他对东方人民的胜利的坚定信心。
    在各文化组织的主持下，加尔各答、孟买、马德拉斯和德里等印度大城市都举行了歌咏会、舞会、朗诵会和上演取材于泰戈尔的作品的话剧，以纪念他的诞辰。
    印度全国各地出版的各种语文的报纸都出了特刊，以纪念他的诞辰。报纸的社论一致号召印度人民记取他热爱人类的伟大遗教、他对世界和平的贡献以及他对人类和文明的敌人的斥责。
    加尔各答孟加拉文日报“自由报”在五月八日发表社论说：“泰戈尔所怀抱的中国的新觉醒的梦想，今天已成为现实了。他经常感到骄傲的东方，今天已跻于包括苏联和中国在内的八万万人民之列了，东方千千万万的人民正在向前迈进。他们不希望战争，他们希望和平，希望得到自由和幸福的未来。”
