Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Tokyo - The heroic Japanese working people, disregarding the frantic suppression by the American and Japanese reactionaries, bravely and enthusiastically celebrated May Day. It is estimated that there were more than 480 May Day rallies held in various parts of Japan, with a total of approximately three million participants. This is the largest May Day celebration since the first one was held twenty-three years ago; and it is also a powerful demonstration by the united Japanese working class and laboring people against the American and Japanese reactionaries, following the general strike on April 18th. In this unprecedented May Day gathering, the Japanese working people emphatically expressed their unwavering determination to oppose war, oppose a separate peace treaty, oppose rearmament, and defend peace, freedom, and independence.

Among the celebrations held across the country, the largest was in Tokyo, with 400,000 participants. From early morning, groups of Tokyo working people continuously entered the venue set up in the Meiji Shrine Outer Garden Square, with members from fifty-four industrial trade unions, students, and citizens packing the venue. Red flags fluttered and slogan signs stood tall. Many slogan signs read: "Oppose the rearmament of Japan, strive for national independence," "American soldiers go home," "Oppose forced grain requisition," and so on. The masses at the rally also carried portraits of Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, as well as Stalin, Mao Zedong, Kim Il-sung, and other leaders of various countries. On this very day, the Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag), which had been illegally banned from publication by the American occupation authorities for nearly two years, was relaunched. The shouts of students and women selling "Akahata" at the venue greatly excited the masses, who rushed to buy it. "Akahata," the battle horn of the Japanese people, published an editorial entitled "Facing a Day of National Shame" in its relaunched issue, pointing out that April 28th, the day the separate peace treaty with Japan came into effect, was a day of national shame for Japan. The newspaper denounced the "peace treaty" and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," pointing out that the "peace treaty" left Japan still occupied by foreign troops. "Akahata" also published a photograph of Tokuda Kyuichi and the Japanese Communist Party's May Day slogans.

The rally officially opened at 10:00 AM. Representatives from trade unions, the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, as well as representatives from cultural circles, all took the stage to deliver speeches. The rally passed twenty-seven slogans: "Down with the reactionary Yoshida Government!" "We want to defend peace!" "Oppose war and rearmament!" "Oppose conscription!" "Oppose the separate peace treaty, the Security Treaty, and the Administrative Agreement!" "American troops, go home!" "We protest against the United States' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea!" "No interference in Korea!" "Down with reactionary bills!" "Fight for wage increases!" and so on. The rally also issued a declaration stating that the Yoshida Cabinet, in violation of the Japanese people's desire to establish friendly relations with countries around the world, signed the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," placing Japan in a position of humiliation and subordination, and attempting to rearm and strengthen monopoly capital. At the same time, in order to suppress the opposition of the working masses, it is revising labor laws, formulating a "Prohibition of General Strikes Law," and restoring the "Maintenance of Public Order Law." We must resolutely struggle to crush the reactionary offensive of the ruling class. The rally also passed a resolution on crushing the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." The resolution pointed out: The Yoshida Cabinet is attempting to rely on a majority vote in the Diet to pass the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." The true intention of the Yoshida government is to use the excuse of preventing subversive activities to suppress anti-government speech and the labor and mass movements. The day the freedom of the people is deprived is the day the ruling class prepares for war against the will of the people. We firmly demand the withdrawal of the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" and continue to fight to crush this bill.

At noon, the rally participants marched in five routes through the city. They held high red flags, slogan signs, and portraits of Tokuda Kyuichi and others, singing the Internationale and shouting slogans.

While the Tokyo working people were holding their celebration, the American and Japanese reactionaries mobilized thousands of American occupation soldiers, 25,000 Japanese police, and a large number of secret agents, provocatively preparing for bloody suppression of the rally participants. Shortly after the demonstration began, the police frantically attacked the peaceful demonstrators, not only wielding batons but also firing guns and tear gas at the crowd. This led to clashes between the masses and the executioners. According to an investigation by an "Asahi Shimbun" reporter, at least 271 people were injured or killed, including 70 seriously injured and one dead. The deceased was Takahashi Masao (transliteration), a government agency worker, who was shot and killed by the barbaric police. The American and Japanese reactionaries also carried out large-scale arrests. According to an investigation by the police authorities on the morning of the 2nd, 89 people had already been arrested in Tokyo, and "there is a possibility that many more will be arrested."

In Kyoto, Maizuru, Himeji, Otsu, Nara, and other places, the police also carried out barbarous suppression of the May Day celebrants, with many people injured and arrested. According to a temporary report issued by the National Police Agency on the evening of the 1st, a total of 207 people were arrested nationwide by midnight on the 1st.

However, the closely united Japanese working people will never be intimidated by this bloody suppression by the American and Japanese reactionaries. They are fighting for independence, freedom, and peace with even more steadfast spirit and greater confidence.

    为争取日本独立自由与和平而坚决斗争
    日本三百万人民“五一”节大示威
    日共“赤旗报”复刊指出四月二十八日为国耻日
    【新华社二日讯】东京消息：英雄的日本劳动人民不顾美、日反动派的疯狂镇压，勇敢而热烈地庆祝五一劳动节。据估计，日本全国各地举行集会庆祝五一节的共有四百八十多处地方，参加者合计约三百万人。这是日本劳动人民自从在二十三年以前首次庆祝五一节以来，规模最盛大的一次；并且也是继四月十八日的总罢工之后，团结一致的日本工人阶级和劳动人民向美、日反动派的一个有力的示威。在这次规模空前的五一节集会中，日本劳动人民着重地表示了他们反对战争、反对单独和约、反对重新武装与保卫和平、自由和独立的不可动摇的决心。
    在各地的庆祝大会中，规模最大的是东京，参加者达四十万人。从清晨起，东京劳动人民成群结队络绎不绝地进入设在明治神宫外苑广场的会场，五十四个产业工会的会员和学生以及市民等，把会场挤得水泄不通。会场上红旗翻飞，标语牌林立。许多标语牌上写着：“反对重新武装日本，争取民族独立”、“美国兵滚回去”、“反对强制征粮”等。大会群众也抬着日本共产党总书记德田球一和斯大林、毛泽东、金日成以及其他各国人民领袖的画像。就在这一天，被美国占领当局非法禁止出版将近两年的日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”复刊了。一些学生和妇女在会场中叫卖“赤旗报”的呼声，使大会群众极感兴奋，纷纷争先抢购。日本人民战斗的号角——“赤旗报”在复刊号上发表了题为“面临国耻日”的社论，指出单独对日和约生效的四月二十八日是日本的国耻日。该报痛斥“和约”与美日“安全条约”，并指出“和约”使日本仍然为外国军队所占领。“赤旗报”同时还刊登了德田球一的照片和日本共产党的五一节口号。
    上午十时，大会正式开幕。工会代表，共产党、劳农党和社会党左派与右派的代表以及文化界的代表等，都上台致词。大会通过了二十七项口号：“打倒反动的吉田政府！”“我们要保卫和平！”“反对战争和重新武装！”“反对征兵！”“反对单独和约、安全条约和行政协定！”“美国军队，回家去！”“我们抗议美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器！”“不准干涉朝鲜！”“打倒反动的法案！”“为增加工资而斗争！”等等。大会并发表宣言说：吉田内阁违背日本人民希望与全世界各国建立友好关系的愿望，签订了美日“行政协定”，陷日本于屈辱和隶属的地位，并力图重新武装，加强垄断资本。同时，为了镇压工人群众的反对，它正在修改劳工法规，制订“禁止总罢工法”，恢复“维持治安法”。我们要坚决斗争，摧毁统治阶级的反动攻势。大会又通过了关于粉碎“防止破坏活动法案”的决议。决议指出：吉田内阁正企图依赖多数票在国会中通过所谓“防止破坏活动法案”。吉田政府的真正意图在于藉口防止破坏活动来镇压反对政府的言论和劳工运动与群众运动。国民的自由被剥夺的日子，也就是统治阶级违反人民意志进行战争准备的日子。我们坚决要求撤销“防止破坏活动法案”，并为粉碎这个法案而继续斗争。
    中午，大会群众分五路在市内举行示威游行。他们高举红旗、标语牌和德田球一等的画像，唱着国际歌，高呼口号。
    在东京劳动人民举行庆祝大会时，美、日反动派动员了上千的美国占领军、二万五千名日本警察和大批特务，对大会群众挑衅地摆好了血腥镇压的阵势。示威游行开始以后不久，警察就疯狂地向和平的示威群众进攻，他们不但挥舞着警棍，并且向群众开枪和施放催泪弹。这样就引起了群众和刽子手之间的冲突。据“朝日新闻”记者的调查，群众至少伤亡二百七十一人，其中七十人伤势严重，一人死亡。死者是政府机关工作人员高桥正夫（译音），他是被野蛮的警察的枪弹打死的。美、日反动派并大肆逮捕。据警察当局在二日上午的调查，东京已经逮捕了八十九人，并且“还有可能增加很多”。
    在京都、舞鹤、姬路、大津、奈良等地，警察也对庆祝五一节的群众进行横蛮的镇压，许多群众受伤和被捕。据国家警察本部一日晚发表的临时报告，到一日午夜为止，全国各地共逮捕了二百零七人。
    但是，紧密团结的日本劳动人民绝不会被美、日反动派这种血腥的镇压所吓倒，他们正以更坚毅的精神和更充分的信心为独立、自由与和平而斗争。
