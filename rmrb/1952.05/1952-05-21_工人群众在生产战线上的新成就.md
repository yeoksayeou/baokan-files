The Working Class's New Achievements on the Production Front

Northeast Machinery Factory No. 20
Successful Trial Production of Small Locomotive

The Northeast Machinery Factory No. 20 successfully trial-produced a small locomotive before Labor Day, and the test run was effective. This locomotive is a 080 type, weighing 18 tons, capable of pulling a 160-ton freight train, and can be used for transportation in mines and forests. The workers of the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 20 overcame many difficulties in design, machinery and equipment, and technical conditions, and successfully manufactured all parts themselves. At the celebration meeting on the 30th, all the employees of Factory No. 20 wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to report the good news.

Taiyuan Machinery Factory
Manufactured Three 300-Meter Drilling Machines

The Taiyuan Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced three 300-meter drilling machines. This is a new product of the Taiyuan Machinery Factory after it independently produced a 65-horsepower coal cutter last year. Drilling machines are the main machinery for geological surveys in prospecting and water conservancy, civil engineering, and other projects. This type of machinery has always been dependent on foreign imports. This successful trial production is another major contribution of China's machinery industry to industrial and agricultural production.

These drilling machines can detect geological components within 300 meters underground; the main shaft speed can reach 113 to 157 revolutions per minute, and the main shaft can be rotated to a 90-degree angle parallel to the ground.

Li Zhilin, Safety Technician of Xi'an Coal Mine
Invented Wind-Powered Blower and Ejector

Li Zhilin, a safety technician from Fuguo Mine, Xi'an Coal Mine in Northeast China, has successively invented two safety devices for use in coal mine pits: a wind-powered blower and an ejector.

Coal mine production must have good ventilation equipment to ensure sufficient airflow in the pit. Otherwise, not only will the workers in the pit not be able to breathe enough fresh air, but there is also a risk of gas explosions in the coal mine. Previously, the blowers used in various pits in the Xi'an mining area had a major drawback: they used electricity as power, which could easily cause gas explosions in areas with high gas concentrations. The blower invented by Li Zhilin uses wind as power and can be used in places with high temperatures and high gas concentrations without causing gas explosions. Secondly, the wind-powered blower is very light, only 20 kilograms, and can be easily moved by one person, making it very convenient to use.

The ejector is also a safety device used in coal mines. Before Li Zhilin invented the ejector, each pit in the Xi'an mining area had special personnel to spread rock powder in the pit to prevent coal dust explosions. However, in the past, it was spread by hand or with shovels, so the spreading was uneven and did not achieve the desired effect, and the rock powder often sprinkled on the operators, affecting their health. After Li Zhilin invented the ejector, both of these shortcomings were overcome.

Song Renyuan, Engineer of Shanghai Water Supply Management Office
Created Electric Pipe Locator and Leak Detector

Song Renyuan, an engineer from the Water Supply Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Utilities Bureau, successfully trial-produced an electric pipe locator and an electric leak detector, and received a reward of 5 million yuan from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government. Using electric leak detectors and electric pipe locators can detect water pipe leaks and water pressure drops at any time and deal with them in a timely manner. At the same time, it can also eliminate the waste of manpower and material resources caused by tap water companies not knowing the exact location of water pipes when connecting water and repairing water pipes. The leak detector made by Song Renyuan is not only more effective than those made in the United States, but also simple in design and easy to use.

Yu Jinhai, Worker of Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory, Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Creates Method to Unify All Types of Brake Shoes

Yu Jinhai, a worker and Youth League member of the Jiulongpo Temporary Machine Factory of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, successfully created a method to unify the first, second, and third types of brake shoes for passenger and freight cars.

Due to different car types, the types of brake shoes used in railways are not uniform. Originally, the second and third types of brake shoes used for passenger and freight cars on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway were costly, and the casting and replacement procedures were complicated. These two types of brake shoes are different from the first type in that they do not have brake shoe holders. Because the first type of brake shoe has a separate brake shoe holder, the brake shoe holder generally does not wear out. When replacing, only the brake shoe needs to be replaced, not the brake shoe holder. When using the second and third types of brake shoes, because there is no brake shoe holder, the brake shoe cannot be used after one-third of it is worn out, resulting in a great waste. Yu Jinhai imitated the method of using brake shoe holders for the first type of brake shoes, and cast two new types of brake shoe holders for the second and third types using cast steel. Installing the first type of brake shoe can completely replace the second and third types of brake shoes. With these two new types of brake shoe holders, the first type of brake shoe can be used uniformly. After remelting the first type of brake shoe, the material can be saved by half compared to casting the second and third types of brake shoes, and the efficiency can be increased from 40 pieces per worker per day to 300 pieces, and the replacement time can be shortened from five minutes per piece to one minute.

    工人群众在生产战线上的新成就
    东北机械二十厂
    试制小型火车头成功
    东北机械二十厂在“五一”节前夕试制小型火车头成功，试车效果良好。这辆火车头是零八零型，体重十八吨，能拉动一百六十吨重的货车，可供矿山和森林的运输使用。东北机械二十厂职工克服了许多设计、机器设备和技术条件等方面的困难，使全部零件自制成功。在三十日的庆祝会上二十厂全体职工特为此写信向毛主席报捷。
    太原机器厂
    造出三部三百公尺钻探机
    太原机器厂试制三部三百公尺的钻探机成功，这是太原机器厂继去年自制六十五匹马力截煤机后的新产品。钻探机是探矿和进行水利、土木等工程时作地质勘测的主要机械。这种机械一向依赖外国进口，这次试制成功，是我国机器工业对工农业生产所作的又一次重大贡献。
    这批钻探机可探测地面下三百公尺以内的地质成分；主轴转速可达每分钟一百一十三转到一百五十七转，主轴并可转至九十度角与地面平行。西安煤矿保安技术员李志林
    创造风力吹风机和喷射器
    东北西安煤矿富国矿保安技术员李志林，先后创造出煤矿坑内使用的风力吹风机和喷射器两种安全装置。
    煤矿生产，必须有很好的通风设备，使坑内有足够的风量。否则，不但坑内作业人员呼吸不到足够的新鲜空气，而且煤矿里还会发生瓦斯爆炸的危险。以前西安矿区各坑使用的吹风机，有一个很大的缺点，是用电作动力，在坑内瓦斯大的地方使用，极易引起瓦斯爆炸。李志林所创造的吹风机，是以风作动力，在温度高和瓦斯大的地方都能使用，不会引起瓦斯爆炸。其次，风力吹风机很轻，只有二十公斤，一个人就能随便挪动，使用非常灵便。
    喷射器也是煤矿内使用的一种安全装置。在李志林发明喷射器以前，西安矿区各坑，都设有专人在坑内散布岩粉以防止煤尘爆炸。但是过去是用手或铁锹散布，所以散得既不均匀，起不到应有的作用，而且岩粉往往撒在操作者身上，影响健康。李志林创造喷射器后，这两个缺点都克服了。
    上海给水管理处工务员宋仁元
    造成电动寻管仪和检漏仪
    上海市人民政府公用局给水管理处工务员宋仁元试制电动寻管仪和电动检漏仪成功，得到上海市人民政府五百万元的奖金。使用电动检漏仪和电动寻管仪，可以随时发现水管漏水和水压低落的情况，及时加以处理；同时，也可以消除自来水公司在接水和检修水管时，因不了解水管的准确位置而造成的人力和物力的浪费。宋仁元制出的检漏仪，不但效果比美国造的好，而且设计简单使用方便。成渝铁路九龙坡临时机厂工人余金海创造统一各型闸瓦的办法
    成渝铁路重庆九龙坡临时机厂工人、青年团员余金海创造统一客货车一、二、三种闸瓦办法成功。
    由于车型不同，铁路所用的闸瓦类型也不统一。原来成渝铁路客货车所用第二、三种闸瓦，成本高，铸造和装换手续复杂。这两种闸瓦和第一种闸瓦不同，没有闸瓦托。第一种闸瓦因为有分离的闸瓦托，闸瓦托一般不会磨损，更换时只要更换闸瓦，而不必更换闸瓦托。而用第二、第三种闸瓦时，因为没有闸瓦托，所以闸瓦磨损三分之一后就不能再用了，造成很大的浪费。余金海仿效第一种闸瓦用闸瓦托的办法，用浇钢铸成第二、第三两种新型的闸瓦托，装上第一种闸瓦，就可以完全代替第二、三种闸瓦。有了这两种新型的闸瓦托，就可以统一使用第一种闸瓦。改铸第一种闸瓦之后材料可比铸造第二、三种闸瓦节省一半，效率可从每天每工铸四十块提高到铸三百块，装换时间由每块五分钟缩短到一分钟。
