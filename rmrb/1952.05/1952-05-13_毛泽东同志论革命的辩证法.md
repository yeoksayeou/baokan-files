Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On Contradiction" elaborates on the views of Marxist, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on materialist dialectics, especially his outstanding analysis of Lenin's major views "On the Question of Dialectics," thus unfolding all aspects of the question of the essence of materialist dialectics. Reading "On Contradiction" enables us to better understand how Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly and vividly applied Marxist dialectics when solving various complex problems of the Chinese revolution. Consequently, it also enables us to better understand why Comrade Mao Zedong has always stood higher and seen further and deeper than others in the struggles within our party concerning ideological and political issues, and why Comrade Mao Zedong has always been able to maintain his high degree of Marxist correctness at any time, and as a result, has always defeated his opponents.

China is a large country in a long-term revolution. Especially after the Russian October Socialist Revolution, the revolutionary movement carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the working class, its magnificent scale, the cruelty of the life-and-death struggle between revolution and domestic and foreign counter-revolution, the combination of unity and struggle within the revolutionary united front, the changes and reorganization of revolutionary enemies and friends, the victories and setbacks in the revolutionary development process, offense and retreat, the extreme imbalance of revolutionary movements in various places, and the diversity of revolutionary struggle forms, and the strategic and tactical versatility used in the armed struggle, which is the main form of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, on a vast area, all of these particularly showed intense contradictions, intense changes, that is to say, particularly showed the dialectical movement of historical events. Obviously, the Chinese Communists must be good at grasping this vibrant dialectical movement of revolution based on the general guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism, and constantly use the new things provided by this dialectical movement of objective things to enrich our ideological dialectics, to enrich our party's theory, principles, policies, and strategies for leading the Chinese revolution, otherwise, the victory of the Chinese revolution is impossible.

The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong became the most outstanding representative and leader of Chinese Marxists-Leninists is because he carried out such a great task. In a certain sense, his "On Contradiction" is a product of the complex and tortuous contradictory movement manifested by the Chinese revolution, and it is connected with an extremely complex and extremely tortuous historical period of the Chinese revolution—namely, the War of Resistance Against Japan. During this period, national contradictions and class contradictions formed a peculiar intersection. The difference between the struggles of the two types of contradictions and their mutual connection, the identity of opposites; various different types of contradictions and various different types of struggles between classes within the national united front, the identity of opposites; according to different conditions, the national struggle itself has its multifaceted nature, and the class struggle itself has its multifaceted nature; the mutual transition of various different states of struggle; the mutual connection between local struggles and overall struggles; so many contradictions are intertwined, concentrating almost all the complex and tortuous contradictory movements manifested in the long term of the Chinese revolution, thus placing the question of dialectics most prominently before the Chinese Communists. Comrade Mao Zedong's presence in such a period, especially his efforts to study Marxist-Leninist dialectics, study the issues of contradictory movement, and combine this study with the experience of the Chinese revolutionary movement, had immeasurable significance for guiding the practice of the Chinese revolution.

It is precisely because Comrade Mao Zedong flexibly applied Marxist-Leninist dialectics that our comrades, in this extremely complex period of contradictory intersection, were not lost, avoiding both "left" leaning errors and right-leaning errors; it enabled us to finally get rid of the reefs placed by domestic and foreign enemies, and push the revolution forward by leaps and bounds, while domestic and foreign enemies had to fall one after another on the road of history.

(II)

Lenin said that dialectics is "the most complete, profound, and free from one-sidedness development doctrine." ("The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism"). Lenin also said: "Dialectics is living, multifaceted (the number of aspects is constantly increasing), with countless facets of observation and approach to reality (with the development from all facets into a philosophical system as a whole) recognition…". ("On the Question of Dialectics") Dialectics is completely incompatible with one-sidedness.

As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in many works: The reason why some of our comrades in the past committed right-leaning opportunist or "left" leaning opportunist errors was because they fell into this or that one-sidedness in their thinking, and one-sidedness is precisely the characteristic of various forms of subjectivism. They did not see the whole picture of revolutionary life, so they had neither materialism nor dialectics.

Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Contradiction":

"The reason why the dogmatist and empiricist comrades in China
make mistakes is because their method of viewing things is subjective,
one-sided, and superficial. One-sidedness and superficiality are also subjectivity; because
all objective things are inherently interconnected and have internal laws,
people do not truthfully reflect these situations, but only
look at them one-sidedly or superficially, without recognizing the interconnection of things,
without recognizing the internal laws of things, so this method is
subjectivism."

This is precisely the case.

The subjectivist's view of things is only fixed in some rigid formulas they themselves imagine. They are particularly addicted to the following two formulas: The first formula: if there is unity, there is no contradiction. The second formula: if there is contradiction, there is no unity. That is to say, they either only singularly highlight a one-sided aspect of unity, or they only singularly highlight a one-sided aspect of contradiction. They will not grasp its contradiction in unity, nor will they grasp its unity in contradiction.

When subjectivists apply these rigid formulas to political issues, they completely fall into extreme absurdity and harm the revolution. For example, during the period of 1924-27, when our party and the Kuomintang formed a united front, the ideological formula of right-leaning opportunism belonged to the first type, thus forming a set of policies of "all alliance, denying struggle." For example, during the ten years of civil war, the ideological formula of "left" leaning opportunism belonged to the second type, thus forming another set of policies of "all struggle, denying alliance."

Since subjectivists can only rigidly absolutize a prominent one-sided aspect under certain historical conditions, and in other historical conditions can only rigidly absolutize another prominent one-sided aspect, therefore, they can sometimes commit right-leaning errors and sometimes commit "left" leaning errors.

Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction," in elaborating on a series of issues such as the universality of contradiction, the particularity of contradiction, the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of contradiction, the identity and struggle of the aspects of contradiction, and the position of antagonism in contradiction, is warning against the inevitable danger to the revolution caused by one-sidedness of thought. Comrade Mao Zedong emphatically criticized dogmatism, precisely because the one-sided arrogance and ignorance of our dogmatists has seriously harmed the revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong spent more space, superbly discussing the particularity of the contradiction of things, precisely because the main characteristic of the one-sidedness of our dogmatists lies in not knowing how to grasp the particularity of the contradiction. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Regarding the question of the particularity of contradiction, there are still many comrades, especially dogmatists, who are not clear about it. They do not understand that the universality of contradiction is inherent in particularity. They also do not understand the importance of studying the particularity of the contradiction of current concrete things for guiding the development of our revolutionary practice." Since dogmatists do not know how to study the particularity of the contradiction of things, they also deprive the general truth of the universality of contradiction of its true flesh and blood, turning general truth "into purely abstract formulas that people cannot grasp," which in fact means not understanding what the universality of the contradiction of things is.

In order to explain the error of the dogmatists' thinking method, Comrade Mao Zedong particularly chewed on Lenin's point about the main point of Marxism: that is, the most essential thing in Marxism, the living soul of Marxism, lies in the concrete analysis of concrete situations. What is concrete analysis of concrete situations? This is concrete analysis of the particularity of the contradiction of things. This is as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Not only must we pay attention to the characteristics of the contradictory movement in the entire process of the development of things, in its interconnections, and in the circumstances of its various parties, but also in the various stages of the development of the process, it also has its characteristics, and we must also pay attention to it." This is also as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Studying the particularity of the contradiction in each stage of the development process of things, we must not only look at it in its connection and in its totality, but also look at it from all aspects of the contradiction in each stage."

It is very clear that our dogmatists are unfortunate because they have lost this living soul of Marxism in their minds. They leave all these concrete analyses, and therefore, for the revolutionary movement, for everything, they can only resemble "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night," and there is no failure.

By analyzing the particularity of contradictions from various aspects, we can grasp the principal contradiction in the development process of things. As Comrade Mao Zedong proposed: We must grasp the principal contradiction, thereby finding a method to solve the principal contradiction, and thereby paving the way for continuing to solve other contradictions. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "When studying any process, if there is a complex process with more than two contradictions, we must use all our strength to find its principal contradiction. If we grasp this principal contradiction, all problems will be easily solved."

But since our dogmatists do not analyze the particularity of contradictions, then, for grasping the principal contradiction, it is like looking for a needle in the sea, and it will never be found. For example, when Japanese imperialists had already invaded our country, they still had not seen the new changes in the contradictions that had occurred. Therefore, they did not know how to grasp this new prominent principal contradiction, and thereby change their policies.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: To find a method to solve the principal contradiction, we must distinguish between the principal aspect and the secondary aspect of the contradiction. He said: "In studying the question of the particularity of contradiction, if we do not study the two situations of the principal and non-principal contradictions in the process and the principal and non-principal aspects of the contradiction, that is, if we do not study the difference between these two contradictory situations, then we will fall into abstract research, and we cannot concretely understand the situation of the contradiction, and therefore we cannot find the correct method to solve the contradiction."

But since our dogmatists cannot distinguish between the principal and non-principal aspects of the contradiction, then, it is impossible to successfully solve any problem. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they had a completely reversed view of the main and non-main forces of the united front, regarding the reactionary forces of the Kuomintang as the main force against Japan, and regarding the forces of workers and peasants as the non-main force against Japan. Therefore, they could not find the correct method to solve the contradiction between the Japanese imperialists and the Chinese people, nor could they find the correct method to solve the contradictions within the anti-Japanese national united front.

The failure of dogmatism precisely illustrates the important position of the particularity of contradiction in the dialectical movement, and whoever does not pay attention to this issue again, whoever will have to wait for failure. "We must take the failure of dogmatists as a warning." This is Comrade Mao Zedong's conclusion on this issue.

(III)

Comrade Mao Zedong constantly seeks the road to victory for the Chinese revolution in the general movement of the world revolution. In every period, he always connects with the universal contradictions of the world, focusing on studying and solving the problems of various specific contradictions encountered by the Chinese revolution in its development. He is good at flexibly applying the universal truths discovered by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as well as Lenin and Stalin's theories on the Chinese revolution, in light of the specific political and economic characteristics of China, thereby grasping the characteristics of the specific process of the development of the Chinese revolution in a certain period, and exposing the contradictions of various aspects of China step by step in each period, so that people can obtain the brilliance of thought in the midst of chaotic groping.

In the revolution from 1924 to 1927, the Chinese proletariat and the national bourgeoisie formed the first national united front with the revolutionary alliance of various classes of the Kuomintang as the organizational form. The reason why the bourgeois people united with the Communist Party was because they had contradictions with foreign imperialism and its running dog, the Northern Warlords, at that time; but because they also had contradictions with the domestic people's masses, they also engaged in a struggle for leadership with the Communist Party. It was correct and necessary for the Communist Party to carry out this union. Before this union was formed, there was a one-sidedness from the "left" side represented by Zhang Guotao, whose characteristic was not recognizing the possibility of the unity of opposing parties, that is, not recognizing the alliance. But after this alliance had been formed, the one-sidedness from the right side represented by Chen Duxiu was particularly prominent, whose characteristic was not recognizing the opposition in unity, that is, not recognizing the contradictory struggle within the united front. Comrade Mao Zedong engaged in an analysis of the contradiction between revolutionary enemies and friends, an analysis of the contradiction between classes within the national united front, and an analysis of the contradiction between various parts within the bourgeoisie, opposing the former type of one-sidedness on the one hand, and on the other hand, particularly using great effort to oppose the latter type of one-sidedness, because the development of the scale of the revolution—especially the development of the peasant revolution, the right-leaning one-sidedness had become the main danger within the party.

After the bourgeoisie represented by the Kuomintang groups of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei successively betrayed the revolution, a new differentiation and a new combination were formed between the forces of the two sides of the revolution and counter-revolution. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, our party independently opened up the road of the vast land revolution, regardless of the betrayal of the Chiang-Wang Kuomintang. The revolution became more in-depth, but due to the betrayal of the Chiang-Wang Kuomintang, the revolution encountered new difficulties. Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunists at this time went from denying the contradictions within the united front to denying the contradictions between the revolution and the counter-revolution, becoming liquidationists, and then colluding with the counter-revolutionary Trotskyites, and thus were expelled from the party. But on the other hand, some one-sidednesses from the "left" side reappeared within the party. These comrades who committed "left" leaning errors saw the sharp contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution, but they denied the tortuousness and long-term nature of the revolution, thinking that the contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution could be quickly resolved on a national scale one accidental morning. They could not see the contradictions within the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary rule, nor could they see the differences and contradictions between the big landlord and big bourgeoisie's ruling faction and the middle-class opposition faction, so the policy they advocated was "overthrowing everything," thinking that there was no room for flexibility under any conditions, and even thinking that there would be no possibility of a united front for the policy toward the petty bourgeoisie. They regarded all political factions of the middle class and petty bourgeoisie as counter-revolutionaries like Chiang Kai-shek, even thinking that they were more dangerous enemies of the revolution than Chiang Kai-shek. At such a time, Comrade Mao Zedong's further analysis of the question of the contradiction between the Chinese revolution and the counter-revolution had decisive significance for promoting the revolution to advance under extremely difficult conditions. He analyzed a prominent contradiction that has long existed in semi-colonial China: that is, on the one hand, the continuous wars formed by the contradictions within the counter-revolutionary ruling class supported by different imperialist forces, and on the other hand, the red regime can use the contradictions within the ruling class and rely on its own correct and flexible policies to occur and persist in the encirclement of the surrounding white regimes. He analyzed this prominent contradiction and came to the conclusion that the Chinese revolution could and must go through the countryside surrounding the cities and then capture the cities, foreseeing that the rural revolutionary bases and some small pieces of red regime would be like "a single spark can start a prairie fire" in a long-term struggle, foreseeing that they would become the starting point for a new great revolution and the Chinese people seizing national power under the leadership of the proletariat.

In 1931, Japanese aggressors began to occupy large tracts of Chinese territory, causing new changes in national contradictions and domestic contradictions, and when Japanese aggressors invaded North China in 1935, this change became even more prominent. But some of our party comrades who had previously committed "left" leaning errors could not see this change for a long time, and then after acknowledging this change, they turned from the one-sidedness of the "left" side to the one-sidedness of the right side. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1937, they only recognized the contradiction between the Japanese aggressors and the Chinese nation, completely ignoring other contradictions, ignoring the class contradictions within the Chinese nation, ignoring that in addition to the contradictions with Japanese imperialism, British and American imperialism also had contradictions with the Chinese nation, thus denying that there were three different aspects of forces, left, middle, and right, within the anti-Japanese national united front, denying that there was a difference between the anti-people line and the people's line on the anti-Japanese issue between the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek, which served as the tool of British and American imperialism, and our party. Comrade Mao Zedong criticized these comrades for their errors of one-sidedness of suddenly "left" and suddenly right. He pointed out: "The development of the Sino-Japanese national contradiction has lowered the position of the contradictions between domestic classes and the contradictions between political groups in political weight, making them secondary and subordinate things. But the contradictions between domestic classes and the contradictions between political groups themselves still exist, and have not been reduced or eliminated. The same is true of the contradictions between China and other imperialist countries other than Japan." ("The Tasks of the Communist Party of China During the War of Resistance Against Japan") That is to say, because of the change in the position of national contradictions and domestic contradictions, our party was able to re-propose and engage in the establishment of a united front including the bourgeoisie; those who opposed the united front were precisely committing the error of one-sidedness. But at the same time, because the class contradictions within the anti-Japanese united front still existed, and the fact that Chiang Kai-shek's forced participation in the War of Resistance Against Japan actually reflected the contradictions between British and American imperialism and Japanese imperialism in the Far East, the proletariat had to take warning from the failure of Chen Duxiu's opportunism in 1927, and firmly implement the principle of independence and self-reliance and firmly adopt the policy of both unity and struggle in the united front, striving to promote the development of contradictions that are conducive to the people, so that the victorious ending of the War of Resistance Against Japan develops into a victorious ending for the people; those who believe that in the united front, "regardless of left, middle, and right" and give up the struggle, are also committing an extremely serious error of one-sidedness.

After Japan surrendered, Comrade Mao Zedong re-analyzed the new changing contradictions in the world and China. He pointed out that American imperialism and its running dogs in various countries replaced the position of German and Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, and the original contradictions between the Chinese people and Japanese imperialism and its running dogs had become the contradictions between the Chinese people and American imperialism and its running dogs. From the analysis of this specific contradiction, Comrade Mao Zedong foresaw that there was no way out for the people of the whole country except to continue the struggle, the People's Liberation Army would turn from defense to offense to achieve complete victory, and Chiang Kai-shek had fallen into a completely isolated position, and his future would inevitably be unpopular and his army would be completely destroyed.

At this time, Comrade Mao Zedong similarly criticized the two types of one-sidedness, the one from the right and the one from the "left." The one-sidedness from the right was to overestimate the strength of the enemy and underestimate the strength of the people, and Comrade Mao Zedong called these "weak and incompetent thoughts." The one-sidedness from the "left" was to harm the middle peasants and destroy industry and commerce in the countryside. Comrade Mao Zedong exposed the reactionary political tendencies of some right-wing elements in the bourgeoisie, but at the same time pointed out:

"Political strikes and economic elimination are two different things. If we confuse these two things, we will make mistakes." Therefore, some comrades corrected the errors of "left" one-sidedness.

In the spring of 1949, when the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army had been wiped out and the country was approaching complete liberation, the contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution in China had undergone a fundamental change. According to the new situation of this fundamental change in contradiction, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the period of the Chinese revolution for more than 20 years, with the countryside as the center and then capturing the cities, had ended, and what had replaced it was the period of going from the cities to the countryside and leading the countryside from the cities. Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the contradictions that would exist after the victory of the revolution in the whole country, the basic contradictions, one is foreign, that is, the contradiction between China and imperialist countries; one is domestic, that is, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. From the analysis of these contradictions, he pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the state system of the people's republic led by the working class, and at the same time pointed out the possibility and necessity of the continued consolidation and development of the people's democratic united front led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, thereby stipulating various policies on these aspects.

On political policy, Comrade Mao Zedong believed that after the victory of the revolution in the whole country, "the policy of long-term cooperation between our party and non-party democratic people must be established in the ideology and work of the whole party," and the one-sidedness to be opposed, on the one hand, is right-leaning accommodationism, and on the other hand, it is "left" closing-doorism or perfunctoryism. On economic policy, Comrade Mao Zedong believed that after the victory of the revolution in the whole country, it is also necessary to oppose the two types of one-sidedness, right and "left." He pointed out: "If we think that we do not need to restrict capitalism now, and think that we can abandon the slogan of 'restricting capital,' this is completely wrong, this is a right-leaning opportunist point of view. But on the contrary, if we think that private capital should be restricted too much and too rigidly, or think that we can simply quickly eliminate private capital and quickly enter a socialist society under the dictatorship of the proletariat, this is also completely wrong. This is a 'left' leaning opportunist or adventurist point of view." Comrade Mao Zedong opposed various one-sidednesses and stipulated all these correct policies, while at the same time warning our party comrades that we must always maintain full vigilance against the attacks of the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets."

The history that our party has gone through precisely illustrates this: Comrade Mao Zedong, according to the development of the situation, at any time captures the current special principal contradiction and the principal aspect of the contradiction, and according to the general guiding principles of Marxism-Leninism, solves it one by one in theory and policy, thereby guiding our great people to constantly overcome countless difficulties and obstacles, and achieve the victory of the new democratic revolution, and prepare for the victory of socialism.

The history that our party has gone through precisely illustrates this: In the struggle on the two lines of opposing right-leaning and "left" leaning opportunism, Comrade Mao Zedong always refutes the one-sided simplified errors of those who either only see unity and do not see contradictions, or only see contradictions and do not see unity, and at any time according to the development of revolutionary life, sees contradictions in unity, and sees unity in contradictions, thus correctly ensuring the great mobility of the party's policy.

History is similarly illustrating this: Comrade Mao Zedong never treats the particularity of contradictions as isolated things. In any research work, he fully pays attention to the mutual connection between the universality of the contradiction and the particularity of the contradiction in the development process of things. Whether he is analyzing any specific contradiction or solving any specific problem, he has never ignored the universality of the contradiction, but always sees the particularity of the contradiction from the universality of the contradiction according to the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, these great teachers, and sees the universality of the contradiction from the particularity of the contradiction.

Comrade Mao Zedong's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "On New Democracy," and many other works all study the Chinese revolution from the world's main contradiction of imperialism (that is, dying capitalism) and the proletarian socialist revolutionary movement analyzed by Lenin and Stalin. He observes the contradictions of China from the overall situation of world contradictions, and at the same time he sees from the analysis of the contradictions of China the world significance contained in this great force of the Chinese revolution, believing that the Chinese revolution is "a great part of the world revolution." "On New Democracy" is precisely a model in the method of analyzing problems in handling the relationship between the particularity of contradiction and the universality of contradiction, and thereby developing Lenin and Stalin's theory that the national question is a part of the general proletarian socialist revolution on the question of the Chinese revolution.

However, it is not only major issues such as the relationship between the Chinese revolution and the world revolution that have the question of the relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction. In Comrade Mao Zedong's view, any thing will have the question of the relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction within its certain range. For example, Comrade Mao Zedong once said in "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" on the question of war: "As long as there is war, there is the overall situation of war. The world can be the overall situation of a war, a country can be the overall situation of a war, an independent guerrilla area, a large independent combat aspect, can also be the overall situation of a war. Anything that has the nature of taking care of all aspects and all stages is the overall situation of war." Then he explained in detail the mutual relationship between the overall situation and the local situation, pointing out on the one hand: "Understanding the things of the overall situation will make it easier to use the things of the local situation... The things of the local situation are subordinate to the things of the overall situation." On the other hand, he pointed out: "However, the things of the overall situation cannot be independent of the local and independent, the overall situation is composed of all its local parts." The relationship between the overall situation and the local situation that Comrade Mao Zedong said here is the relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction. The situation of war is like this, and there is no other situation that is not like this.

It is very clear that if we are only limited to vaguely looking at the universality of the contradiction, and do not specifically reveal the particularity of the contradiction, that is to say, if we are only limited to vaguely looking at the things of the overall situation, and do not specifically reveal the things of the local situation—especially revealing the things of the local situation that have decisive significance, then we will commit the error of one-sidedness. Why? Because "the overall situation is composed of all its local parts." Conversely, if we are only limited to superficially seeing the particularity of the contradiction, and do not closely connect with the universality of the contradiction, that is to say, if we are only limited to seeing the things of the local situation, and do not closely connect with the things of the overall situation, then we will also commit the error of one-sidedness. Why? Because "the things of the local situation are subordinate to the things of the overall situation."

In "On Contradiction," Comrade Mao Zedong briefly narrated the analysis methods of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on the question of the relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction, and then made the following generalization:

"The relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction is
the relationship between the commonness and individuality of contradiction. Its commonness is that contradiction exists in
all processes and runs through the entire process from beginning to end,... So
it is commonness, it is absoluteness. However, this commonness is included in
all individuality, without individuality there is no commonness... Because the contradictions are all
specially specific, so it creates individuality. All individuality is
conditionally temporarily existing, so it is relative.

This principle of commonness individuality, absolute relativity, is the essence of the question of the contradiction of things. Without understanding it, it is tantamount to abandoning
dialectics."

Profoundly explaining and developing this essence of Marxist-Leninist dialectics is Comrade Mao Zedong's contribution.

(IV)

According to Lenin, the dialectics of revolution is "what is decisive in Marxism." Lenin ridiculed the extreme pedantry of the heroes of the Second International, because they did not understand the dialectics of revolution at all, and they did not understand at all what Marx said about the need for great flexibility in revolutionary periods. (See Lenin: "On Our Revolution")

Lenin wrote in his essay "On the Correspondence of Marx and Engels": "If we want to use one word to determine the aggregation point of the entire collection of correspondence, that is, the central point where all the ideas published and discussed in it are aggregated, then this word is dialectics. Marx and Engels paid the most attention to it, they made the most important and novel contributions to it, and thus created a genius progress in the history of revolutionary thought, that is, using materialist dialectics to fundamentally transform the entire political economy, and applying materialist dialectics to history, natural science, philosophy, and the policies and strategies of the working class."

Stalin wrote in "Anarchism or Socialism": "Scientific history shows that the dialectical method is a truly scientific method... The spirit of dialectics runs through all modern science."

From this it can be seen that without understanding materialist dialectics, it is impossible to understand Marxism. We must use the viewpoint of materialist dialectics to study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Because there is one thing that connects the thoughts of all the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and this is materialist dialectics.

Similarly, without the viewpoint of materialist dialectics, it is also impossible to understand all of Comrade Mao Zedong's works on the question of the Chinese revolution. Because in the thoughts of all of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, there is one thing that connects them, and this is also materialist dialectics.

Comrade Mao Zedong not only used materialist dialectics in all his works, and not only wrote "On Contradiction," a special work on dialectics, but also in his many works on various issues, he often gave us direct enlightenment on some important issues of materialist dialectics. For example, in the work "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," he directly raised the dialectical question about phenomenon and essence. He said: "We must look at the essence of things, and only regard its phenomenon as a guide to entering the door. Once we enter the door, we must grasp its essence. This is a reliable scientific method of analysis." In the work "Pay Attention to the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," he directly raised the dialectical question about tasks and methods of work. He said: "Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of bridges or boats, crossing the river is just empty talk. Without solving the problem of methods, tasks are just blind talk." In the work "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," he directly raised the dialectical question about the general law and special law of war, and also the dialectical question about the overall situation and the local situation quoted earlier in this article. In the work "On Protracted War," he directly raised a series of dialectical questions about the material and comprehensive theory of knowledge, and criticized the subjective and one-sided theory of knowledge. In the work "Study" at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, he wrote: "Movement is developing, and there are new things ahead, and new things are emerging endlessly. Studying the overall situation of this movement and its development is a major topic that we must always pay attention to. If anyone refuses to make serious and detailed studies of these, then he is not a Marxist." Comrade Mao Zedong here is also directly raising the question of dialectics. And so on.

Comrade Mao Zedong always puts Marxist-Leninist dialectics in an extremely prominent position on any occasion, and is completely faithful to the dialectics of revolution in all his work.

Lenin wrote in "Summary of Hegel's 'Logic'":

"The unfolding of the entire sum of the elements of reality (note) is equal to the essence of dialectical understanding." Many of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, such as: "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," "On the Strategy of Resisting Japanese Imperialism," "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War," "The Tasks of the Communist Party of China During the War of Resistance Against Japan," "The Situation and Tasks of the War of Resistance Against Japan After the Fall of Shanghai and Taiyuan," "Strategic Issues in Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare," "On Protracted War," "Independence and Autonomy in the United Front," "Problems of War and Strategy," "The Chinese Revolution and the Communist Party of China," "On New Democracy," "The Current Tactical Problems in the Anti-Japanese United Front," "On Policy," "Summary on Defeating the Second Anti-Communist Upsurge," "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," "On Coalition Government," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship" These famous works, etc., are characterized by being good at unfolding the entire sum of the elements of reality. He first analyzes the initial state of the development of the contradiction of things, then step by step, layer by layer, deeply exposes all aspects of reality, the mutual intersection and mutual transition of various aspects, and reaches conclusions about solving the contradiction.

The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Protracted War" in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan and "On New Democracy" in the middle stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan were able to attract the hearts of the Chinese people, enabling countless Chinese people to see their own light in difficulties and confusion, is because these works unfolded the entire sum of the elements of reality. He gave genius analysis and synthesis to various aspects, various parts, and various relationships of the specific contradictory movement at that time, interwoven with the dialectics of revolutionary life from beginning to end, thus making people think that his thought is irresistible.

Throughout the entire period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong's works on policy issues analyzed various contradictions in a zigzag and flexible manner, and proposed various differential countermeasures based on the various contradictory aspects of the other party, fully demonstrating the very outstanding and lively power of Marxist-Leninist dialectics.

The reason why Comrade Mao Zedong was able to so excellently apply Marxist-Leninist dialectics to solve the problems of the Chinese revolution is clearly because he lived in combat, he studied dialectics for the people's struggle, and he used dialectics to wage a firm struggle against various opponents.

Stalin mentioned in "Foundations of Leninism" that Marx himself said: the dialectical method "is in essence a critical revolutionary doctrine." At the same time, he pointed out: "Lenin's method is thoroughly permeated with this spirit of critical revolution." Stalin said in "On Dialectical and Historical Materialism" that the original meaning of the word dialectics is to conduct debate. He pointed out: "What the ancients called dialectics was the art of seeking the truth by revealing the contradictions in the other party's arguments and overcoming these contradictions." The spirit of dialectics that runs through the entire works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is the spirit of struggle. Without struggle, there is no dialectics. Therefore, no scholar can possibly understand materialist dialectics.

Comrade Mao Zedong's writing experience is his experience of applying materialist dialectics to fight against the enemies of the people and against various erroneous thoughts within the party, and in the struggle he constantly attracted the power of the people's struggle to enhance the thought of materialist dialectics. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Protracted War" about "conscious initiative." There is no doubt that whoever is able to highly exert conscious initiative in the revolution is he who is able to combine with the current specific struggle and highly apply materialist dialectics.

Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On Contradiction" itself is a great fighting work, and its publication has great new significance for us. It will enable us to better understand how we must study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and better understand how we must study the works of

    毛泽东同志论革命的辩证法
    陈伯达
    （一）
    毛泽东同志的著作“矛盾论”阐发了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的唯物辩证法观点，特别是对于列宁“关于辩证法问题”这一著作的主要观点，作了极其杰出的分析的工作，从而展开了关于唯物辩证法的本质的问题的各个方面。阅读“矛盾论”，使得我们能够更加懂得毛泽东同志在从事解决中国革命的各种复杂问题的时候，是如何深刻地和如何生动地运用马克思主义的辩证法；因而也就使得我们能够更加懂得为什么毛泽东同志历来在我们党内关于思想问题和政治问题的斗争中，总是比别人站得更高与看得更远更深，为什么毛泽东同志在任何时机总是能够保持自己高度的马克思主义的正确性，而结果总是战败了论敌。
    中国是一个处在长期革命中的大国。特别是在俄国十月社会主义革命之后，中国人民在工人阶级领导下所进行的革命运动，它的规模的壮阔，革命与国内外反革命的生死斗争的残酷，革命统一战线内部的又联合又斗争，革命敌友的变化与重新组合，革命发展过程中的胜利和挫折，进攻和退却，各地革命运动的极端不平衡，革命斗争形式的多种多样，作为中国革命斗争主要形式的武装斗争在广阔地面上所使用的战略战术的多端随机应变，所有这些，都特别表现出激烈的矛盾，激烈的变化，也即是说，特别表现出历史事变的辩证法运动。很明显，中国共产党人必须善于根据马克思列宁主义一般的指导的原理，去掌握这样生气勃勃的革命的辩证法运动，不断地把这种客观事物的辩证法运动所提供的新东西用以丰富我们思想上的辩证法，用以丰富我们党领导中国革命的理论、方针、政策和策略，否则，中国革命的胜利是不可能的。
    毛泽东同志所以成为中国马克思列宁主义者最杰出的代表和领袖，就是因为他执行了这样一个伟大的任务。在一定的意义上说来，他的“矛盾论”，就是中国革命所表现出的复杂而曲折的矛盾运动的产物，并且是和中国革命的一个极端复杂和极端曲折的历史时期——即抗日战争时期相联系的。在这一个时期，民族矛盾和阶级矛盾形成了奇特的交错。两类矛盾的斗争之间的差别及其互相联结，对立的同一性；民族统一战线内部各阶级之间的各种不同性质的矛盾和各种不同性质的斗争，对立的同一性；根据不同的条件，民族斗争本身有它的多面性，阶级斗争本身又有它的多面性；各种不同的斗争状态的互相推移；局部斗争和全局斗争的互相联结；如此等等的矛盾纠缠在一起，差不多把中国革命长期中所表现出的复杂而曲折的矛盾运动都集中起来，因而也就把辩证法问题最突出地摆在中国共产党人的面前。毛泽东同志临在这样一个时期，特别用力去研究马克思列宁主义的辩证法，研究矛盾运动的诸问题，并把这种研究和中国革命运动的经验结合起来，这就对于指导中国革命的实践，有着不可估量的意义。
    事情正是由于毛泽东同志灵活地运用了马克思列宁主义的辩证法，使得我们同志们处在这样极端复杂的矛盾交错的时期，能够不致迷失方向，既避免陷入“左”倾的错误，又避免陷入右倾的错误；使得我们终于摆脱了国内外敌人所放置的暗礁，把革命大踏步地推向前进，而国内外的敌人结果只好一个又一个地倒在历史的道路上。
    （二）
    列宁说，辩证法乃是“最完整深刻而没有片面性弊病的发展学说”。（“马克思主义的三个来源与三个组成部分”）列宁又说：“辩证法是活生生的、多方面的（方面的数目永远增加着），带着对现实的任何观察与接近之无数侧面的（具有从各个侧面发展成为整体的哲学体系的）认识……”。（“关于辩证法问题”）辩证法是和片面性完全不能够相容的。
    正如毛泽东同志在许多著作中所指出的：过去我们有些同志之所以犯右倾机会主义或“左”倾机会主义的错误，就都是因为他们在思想上陷入这样或那样的片面性，而片面性正是各种形式的主观主义的特点。他们没有看到革命生活的全貌，所以他们就没有唯物论，也没有辩证法。
    毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中写道：
    “中国的教条主义和经验主义的同志们所以犯
    错误，就是因为他们看事物的方法是主观的、片
    面的和表面的。片面性、表面性也是主观性；因
    为一切客观事物本来是互相联系的和具有内部规
    律的，人们不去如实地反映这些情况，而只是片
    面地或表面地去看它们，不认识事物的互相联
    系，不认识事物的内部规律，所以这种方法是主
    观主义的。”
    事实正是如此。
    主观主义者对于事物的看法，只是固定化在他们自己设想的一些僵死的公式里面。他们特别沉溺在以下的这两种公式：第一种公式：如果说那里有统
    一的东西，便也就没有矛盾的东西。第二种公式：如果说那里有矛盾的东西，便也就没有统一的东西。就是说，他们或者只是单独地突出一个统一的片面，或者只是单独地突出一个矛盾的片面。他们不会在统一中把握其矛盾，又不会在矛盾中把握其统一。
    主观主义者把他们这些僵死的公式用在政治问题上，便完全陷于极端的荒谬，而致害于革命。例如：当一九二四——二七年间，我们党和国民党成立统一战线的时候，右倾机会主义的思想公式，便是属于第一种，因而在政策上形成了“一切联合，否认斗争”的一套。又例如：当十年内战时期，“左”倾机会主义的思想公式，便是属于第二种，因而在政策上又形成了“一切斗争，否认联合”的另一套。
    主观主义者既然在某种历史条件下只会死板地绝对化某一个突出的片面，而在其他的历史条件下又只会死板地绝对化另一个突出的片面，因此，他们就可以时而犯右倾错误，又时而犯“左”倾错误。
    毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”，在阐发矛盾的普遍性、矛盾的特殊性、主要的矛盾和主要的矛盾方面、矛盾诸方面的同一性和斗争性、对抗在矛盾中的地位等等这一系列的问题的时候，都是在警告思想的片面对于革命所必然引起的危险性。毛泽东同志着重地批判了教条主义，这就是因为我们教条主义者的片面性的狂妄无知，曾经很重大地危害过革命的缘故。
    毛泽东同志用了较多的篇幅，卓绝地论述了事物矛盾的特殊性，这就是因为我们教条主义者的片面性的主要特点，就在于不懂得把握矛盾的特殊性。毛泽东同志说：“关于矛盾的特殊性的问题，则还有很多的同志，特别是教条主义者，弄不清楚。他们不了解矛盾的普遍性即寓于特殊性之中。他们也不了解研究当前具体事物的矛盾的特殊性，对于我们指导革命实践的发展有何等重要的意义。”教条主义者既然不懂得研究事物矛盾的特殊性，从而也就剥夺了矛盾的普遍性的真实血肉，把一般真理“变成为人们所不能够捉摸的纯粹抽象的公式”，实际上也即是不懂得什么是事物矛盾的普遍性。
    为了说明教条主义者的思想方法的错误，毛泽东同志特别咀嚼了列宁所指出的关于马克思主义的主要点：即马克思主义的最本质的东西，马克思主义活的灵魂，就在于具体地分析具体的情况。什么是具体地分析具体的情况？这就是具体地分析事物矛盾的特殊性。这就是如毛泽东同志所说的：“不但事物发展的全过程中的矛盾运动，在其相互联结上，在其各方情况上，我们必须注意其特点，而且在过程发展的各个阶段中，也有其特点，也必须注意。”这又就是如毛泽东同志所说的：“研究事物发展过程中的各个发展阶段上的矛盾的特殊性，不但必须在其联结上、在其总体上去看，而且必须从各个阶段中矛盾的各个方面去看。”
    很明白，我们的教条主义者之所以不幸，就是因为他们脑子里面失掉了这样的马克思主义的活的灵魂。他们离开这一切具体的分析，因而对于革命的运动，对于一切事物，就都只能类似“盲人骑瞎马，夜半临深池”，那是没有不失败的。
    由各个方面分析矛盾的特殊性，才能达到捉住事物发展过程中的主要矛盾。如毛泽东同志所提出：必须捉住主要的矛盾，从而找出解决主要矛盾的方法，又从而为继续解决其他的矛盾开辟道路。毛泽东同志说：“研究任何过程，如果存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂的过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    但我们的教条主义者既然不去分析矛盾的特殊性，那末，对于捉住主要的矛盾这一件事，也就只好像在海底捞针一样，是永远捞不着的。例如：当日本帝国主义者已经打到我国里面的时候，他们就还没有看到所发生的矛盾的新变化。因此，他们也就不懂得去捉住这个新的突出的主要矛盾，并从而变化自己的政策。
    毛泽东同志指出：要找出解决主要矛盾的方法，就必须分别该矛盾之主要的方面和次要的方面。他说：“在研究矛盾特殊性的问题中，如果不研究过程中主要的矛盾和非主要的矛盾以及矛盾之主要的方面和非主要的方面这两种情形，也就是说不研究这两种矛盾情况的差别性，那就将陷入抽象的研究，不能具体地懂得矛盾的情况，因而也就不能找出解决矛盾的正确的方法。”
    但我们的教条主义者既然不能够分别矛盾的主要方面和非主要方面，那末，也就不可能成功地解决任何的问题。例如：在抗日战争时期，他们对于统一战线的主要力量和非主要力量，就有了完全颠倒的看法，把国民党的反动力量看成抗日的主要力量，而把工人和农民的力量看成抗日的非主要力量。因此，他们也就不可能找出解决日本帝国主义者和中国人民这两方面矛盾的正确的方法，同样也不可能找出解决抗日民族统一战线内部矛盾的正确的方法。
    教条主义的失败，恰恰说明了矛盾的特殊性在辩证法运动中的重要的地位，而谁如果再不去注意到这个问题，谁就还是只好等着失败。“我们必须以教条主义者的失败为鉴戒”。这就是毛泽东同志在这个问题上的结论。
    （三）
    毛泽东同志不断地在世界革命的总运动中找寻中国革命胜利的道路。他在每一个时期内，总是联系着世界普遍性的矛盾，着重地研究与解决中国革命在发展中所遇到的种种特殊性的矛盾的问题。他善于针对着中国的政治的和经济的具体特点，灵活地运用了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林所发现的普遍真理以及列宁斯大林关于中国革命问题的学说，从而掌握中国革命的发展在其某一定时期的具体过程的特点，并且在各个时期一步一步深入地暴露中国各个方面的矛盾，使得人们在纷乱的摸索中，得到思想的光辉。
    在一九二四年到一九二七年的革命中，中国无产阶级和民族资产阶级以国民党的各阶级革命联盟为组织形式，形成了第一次的民族统一战线。资产阶级的人们之所以和共产党联合，是因为他们那时有和国外帝国主义及其走狗北洋军阀的矛盾；但又因为他们有和国内人民大众的矛盾，所以又和共产党进行领导权的斗争。共产党进行这个联合是正确的，必要的。在这个联合还没有形成的时候，曾经有以张国焘为代表的从“左”方面来的片面性，其特点是不承认对立方面的统一的可能性，即不承认联合。但在这个联合业已形成之后，便特别突出了以陈独秀为代表的从右方面来的片面性，其特点是不承认统一中的对立，即不承认统一战线内部的矛盾的斗争。毛泽东同志从事关于革命敌友的矛盾的分析，关于民族统一战线内部阶级之间的矛盾的分析，关于资产阶级内部各部分之间的矛盾的分析，便一方面反对了前一类的片面性，而另一方面又特别用大力反对了后一类的片面性，因为革命规模的发展——特别是农民革命的发展，右倾的片面性已成为党内主要的危险。
    当以蒋介石和汪精卫的国民党集团为代表的资产阶级相继叛变了革命之后，革命和反革命的矛盾双方的力量之间形成了新的分化，新的结合。我们党在毛泽东同志的领导下，不顾蒋汪国民党的叛变，独立地开辟了广阔的土地革命的道路。革命是更加深入了，但是由于蒋汪国民党的叛变，革命却遇到了新的困难。陈独秀的右倾机会主义者在这时候由原来否认统一战线内部的矛盾而走到否认革命与反革命之间的矛盾，变成了取消主义者，随又与反革命的托洛茨基派合伙，因而被逐出党外。但另方面，在党内则重新出现了一些从“左”方面来的片面性。这些犯“左”倾错误的同志，看到了革命与反革命的尖锐的矛盾，但是他们否认革命的曲折性和长期性，以为革命与反革命之间的矛盾，可以很快地在一个偶然的早上，便在全国规模上得到解决。他们看不见国民党反革命统治内部的矛盾，也看不见大地主大资产阶级在朝派与中产阶级在野派的差别和矛盾，因此他们主张的政策是“一切打倒”，以为在任何条件下都没有什么灵活的余地，甚至以为对小资产阶级的政策都不会有什么统一战线的可能性。他们把中产阶级和小资产阶级的一切政派都看成是和蒋介石一样的反革命，甚至以为它们还是比蒋介石更危险的革命敌人。在这样一个时候，毛泽东同志进一步地分析中国革命与反革命之间的矛盾的问题，这对于推动革命在极其困难的条件下前进，具有决定的意义。他分析了半殖民地中国长期存在的一种突出的矛盾：即一方面是在不同的帝国主义势力支持之下的反革命统治阶级内部矛盾所形成的继续不断的战争，另一方面便是红色政权能够利用统治阶级内部的矛盾并依靠自己正确的机变的政策，而在四周围白色政权的包围中间发生和坚持下来。他分析了这个突出的矛盾，便得出了中国革命能够而且必须经过乡村包围城市然后取得城市的结论，预见了乡村革命根据地和一些小块的红色政权在长时期的斗争中将如“星星之火、可以燎原”，预见了它们将成为新的大革命和中国人民在无产阶级领导下夺取全国政权的出发点。
    在一九三一年，日本侵略者开始侵占中国大片的领土，使民族矛盾和国内矛盾又开始发生了新的变化，而当一九三五年日本侵略者向华北侵入的时候，就更加突出了这种变化。但我们党内原来一些犯“左”倾错误的同志曾经在很长时间内看不到这种变化，随后承认了这种变化，却又由“左”的方面的片面性转到右的方面的片面性。在一九三七年抗日战争爆发之后，他们只承认了日本侵略者和中国民族的矛盾，而完全抹煞其他的矛盾，抹煞了中国民族内部的阶级矛盾，抹煞了美英帝国主义除了和日本帝国主义的矛盾之外还有和中国民族的矛盾，因而否认了在抗日民族统一战线内部有左、中、右三种不同方面力量的差别，否认了在那作为美英帝国主义工具的蒋介石国民党与我们党之间对于抗日问题有反人民的路线和人民的路线的差别。毛泽东同志批判了这些同志忽“左”忽右的片面性的错误。他指出：“中日民族矛盾的发展，在政治比重上，降低了国内阶级间的矛盾和政治集团间的矛盾的地位，使他们变为次要和服从的东西。但是国内阶级间的矛盾和政治集团间的矛盾本身依然存在着，并没有减少或消灭。中国和日本以外其他帝国主义国家之间的矛盾亦然。”（“中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”）就是说，因为有民族矛盾与国内矛盾的地位的变化，所以我们党便能够重新提出并从事建立包括资产阶级在内的统一战线；那些反对统一战线的，正是犯了片面性的错误。但同时又因为抗日统一战线内部的阶级矛盾依然存在，以及蒋介石的被迫参加抗日这一件事在实际上是反映了美英帝国主义和日本帝国主义在远东争霸的矛盾，所以无产阶级就必须鉴戒一九二七年陈独秀机会主义的覆辙，而在统一战线中坚定地执行独立自主的原则和坚定地采取又团结又斗争的政策，力求推动矛盾的发展有利于人民，使抗日战争胜利的结局发展为人民胜利的结局；那些认为在统一战线中，“不分左中右”而放弃斗争的，也正是犯了极其严重的片面性的错误。
    在日本投降以后，毛泽东同志重新分析了世界和中国所发生的新的变化的矛盾。他指出了美帝国主义及其在各国的走狗代替德日帝国主义及其走狗的地位，中国人民原来和日本帝国主义及其走狗的矛盾已变为中国人民和美帝国主义及其走狗的矛盾。从这个具体矛盾的分析中，毛泽东同志预见了全国人民除了继续斗争再无出路，人民解放军将由防御转到进攻以取得完全的胜利，而蒋介石则已陷于完全孤立的地位，他的前途必然是众叛亲离，全军覆灭。
    在这个时候，毛泽东同志同样地批判了从右方面来的和从“左”方面来的两种片面性。从右方面来的片面性，乃是过高地估计敌人的力量和过低地估计人民的力量，毛泽东同志把这些叫做“软弱无能的思想”。从“左”方面来的片面性，乃是在乡村中损害中农和破坏工商业。毛泽东同志揭露了资产阶级中一些右翼分子的反动政治倾向，但同时指出了：
    “政治上的打击与经济上的消灭是两件事，如果混同这两件事，我们就要犯错误。”因此，就使得一些同志纠正了“左”的片面性的错误。
    当一九四九年春间，蒋介石匪军的主力已被消灭、全国正接近完全解放的时候，中国革命与反革命的矛盾已发生了根本的变化。毛泽东同志根据这个矛盾根本变化的新形势，即指出了二十几年来中国革命以乡村为重心然后取得城市的时期已经完结，代之而起的，乃是由城市到乡村并由城市领导乡村的时期。毛泽东同志分析了革命在全国胜利以后的所将存在的矛盾，其基本的矛盾，一种是国外的，即中国与帝国主义国家的矛盾；一种是国内的，即无产阶级与资产阶级的矛盾。他由这些矛盾的分析，指出了必须强化工人阶级领导的人民共和国的国家制度，同时指出了在工人阶级领导下的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线的继续巩固和发展的可能性和必要性，从而规定了关于这些方面的种种政策。
    在政治的政策上，毛泽东同志认为在全国革命胜利以后，“我党和党外民主人士长期合作的政策，必须在全党思想和工作上确定下来”，而所要反对的片面性，一方面是右的迁就主义，另方面就是“左”的关门主义或敷衍主义。在经济的政策上，毛泽东同志认为在全国革命胜利以后也必须反对右的和“左”的两种片面性。他这样指出：“如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃‘节制资本’的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。但是反过来，如果认为应当对私人资本限制得太大太死，或者认为简直可以很快地消灭私人资本，很快地进入无产阶级专政的社会主义社会，这也是完全错误的。这就是‘左’倾机会主义或冒险主义的观点。”毛泽东同志反对各种片面性而规定这一切正确的政策，同时便已警告了我们党的同志对于资产阶级的“糖衣炮弹”的攻击，必须随时保持充分的警惕。
    我们党所经过的历史正是这样地说明的：毛泽东同志根据时局的发展，随时捕捉当前特殊的主要的矛盾以及主要的矛盾方面，而根据马克思列宁主义的一般的指导的原理，一个一个地在理论上和政策上解决了它，由此引导我们伟大的人民不断地克服无数的困难和阻碍，而取得了新民主主义革命的胜利，并准备着社会主义的胜利。
    我们党所经过的历史也正是这样地说明的：毛泽东同志在反对右倾与“左”倾机会主义的两条战线的斗争中，总是驳斥那些或者只看到统一而没有看到矛盾、或者只看到矛盾而没有看到统一的片面的简单化的错误，而随时根据革命生活的发展，从统一中看出矛盾，又从矛盾中看出统一，因此就正确地保证了党的政策的极大机动性。
    历史同样又是这样地说明的：毛泽东同志从来不把矛盾的特殊性当做孤立的东西。他在任何研究工作中，都充分地注意到事物发展过程之矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的互相联结。他不论在分析任何一个具体的矛盾或解决任何一个具体的问题的时候，都不曾忽视矛盾的普遍性，而总是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林这些伟大的导师的学说，从矛盾的普遍性中看出矛盾的特殊性，又从矛盾的特殊性中看出矛盾的普遍性。
    毛泽东同志在“中国社会各阶级的分析”、“新民主主义论”以及其他许多著作，都是从列宁和斯大林所分析的帝国主义（即垂死的资本主义）和无产阶级社会主义的革命运动这个世界主要的矛盾来研究中国革命问题的。他从世界矛盾的全局来观察中国的矛盾，同时他又从分析中国的矛盾而看出中国革命这一伟大力量所包含的世界意义，认为中国革命是“世界革命的伟大的一部分”。“新民主主义论”这个著作正是在分析问题的方法上模范地处理了矛盾的特殊性和矛盾的普遍性的关系，并由此在中国革命问题上发展了列宁斯大林关于民族问题是一般无产阶级的社会主义革命的一部分这一个理论。
    然而不只是像中国革命和世界革命的关系这样的大问题才有矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的关系的问题。在毛泽东同志看来，任何事物在其一定的范围中都会有其矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的关系的问题。例如，毛泽东同志在“中国革命战争的战略问题”中曾经就战争这一个问题说道：“只要有战争，就有战争的全局。世界可以是战争的一全局，一国可以是战争的一全局，一个独立的游击区、一个大的独立的作战方面，也可以是战争的一全局。凡属带有要照顾各方面和各阶段的性质的，都是战争的全局。”接着他就详细地说明了全局性和局部性的互相关系，一方面指出：“懂得了全局性的东西，就更会使用局部性的东西……局部性的东西是隶属于全局性的东西的。”另方面又指出：“然而全局性的东西，不能脱离局部而独立，全局是由它的一切局部构成的。”毛泽东同志这里所说的全局性和局部性的关系，就是矛盾普遍性和矛盾特殊性的关系。战争的情况是这样，其他的情况也没有不是这样的。
    很明白，如果只是限于笼统地看看矛盾的普遍性，而没有具体地揭露矛盾的特殊性，就是说，如果只是笼统地看看全局的东西，而没有具体地揭露局部的东西——特别是揭露那具有决定意义的局部的东西，那末，便会犯片面性的错误。为什么？因为“全局是由它的一切局部构成的”。反之，如果只限于表面地看到矛盾的特殊性，而没有密切地联系矛盾的普遍性，就是说，如果只是限于看到局部的东西，而没有密切地联系全局的东西，那末，便也会犯片面性的错误。为什么？因为“局部性的东西是隶属于全局性的东西的”。
    在“矛盾论”中，毛泽东同志关于事物矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的关系的问题，扼要地叙述了马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的分析方法，随后即作了以下的概括：
    “矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的关系，就是
    矛盾的共性和个性的关系。其共性是矛盾存在于
    一切过程中，并贯串于一切过程的始终，……所
    以它是共性，是绝对性。然而这种共性，即包含于
    一切个性之中，无个性即无共性。……因为矛盾
    的各各特殊，所以造成了个性。一切个性都是有
    条件地暂时地存在的，所以是相对的。
    这一共性个性、绝对相对的道理，是关于事物
    矛盾的问题的精髓，不懂得它，就等于抛弃了辩
    证法。”
    深刻地说明了和发展了这个马克思列宁主义辩证法的精髓，乃是毛泽东同志的贡献。
    （四）
    按照列宁的说法，革命的辩证法是“马克思主义中有决定意义的东西”。列宁讥笑第二国际英雄们的万分迂腐，因为他们对于革命的辩证法是一窍不通的，他们完全不了解马克思所说的在革命时期必须有极大的机变性。（见列宁：“论我国革命”）
    列宁在他的“论马克思恩格斯通信集”的论文中写道：“如果我们想用一个字来断定全部通信集的集点，即其中所发表所讨论的一切思想集结的中心点，那么这个字就是辩证法。马克思和恩格斯最为注意，他们对之有最重要最新颖的贡献，因而在革命思想史上造成了天才进步的地方，就是运用唯物辩证法来根本改造全部政治经济学，把唯物辩证法运用于历史、自然科学、哲学以及工人阶级的政策和策略方面。”
    斯大林在“无政府主义还是社会主义”的著作中写道：“科学底历史表明着：辩证方法是真正科学的方法……辩证法的精神贯通全部现代科学。”
    由此可见，不懂得唯物辩证法，就不可能懂得马克思主义。必须用唯物辩证法的观点来学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的著作。因为有一个东西把马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林全部著作的思想贯串起来的，这就是唯物辩证法。
    同样地，如果没有唯物辩证法的观点，要懂得毛泽东同志关于中国革命问题的一切著作，也是不可能的。因为在毛泽东同志一切著作的思想中，有一个东西贯串起来的，这也就是唯物辩证法。
    毛泽东同志不但一切著作都是借助于唯物辩证法，不但写了“矛盾论”这个专门的辩证法著作，而且还在他关于各种问题的许多著作中，对于唯物辩证法的一些重要问题，时常给我们作直接的启示。例如：在“星星之火，可以燎原”的著作里面，他直接提出了关于现象和实质的辩证法问题。他说：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”在“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的著作里面，他直接提出了关于任务和工作方法的辩证法问题。他说：“我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”在“中国革命战争的战略问题”的著作里面，他直接提出了关于战争的一般规律和特殊规律的辩证法问题，又如前面本文所引述的关于全局性和局部性的辩证法问题。在“论持久战”的著作里，他直接地提出了关于唯物的全面的认识论一系列的辩证法问题，而批判了主观的和片面的认识论。在党的六届六中全会论“学习”的著作里面，他写道：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。如果有人拒绝对于这些作认真的过细的研究，那他就不是一个马克思主义者。”毛泽东同志在这里也正是直接地提出了辩证法的问题。如此等等。
    毛泽东同志平日不论在任何场合，总是把马克思列宁主义的辩证法提到极其突出的地位，而在自己的一切工作中完全忠实于革命的辩证法。
    列宁在“黑格尔‘逻辑学’一书摘要”写道：
    “现实性诸要素之全部总和底展开（注意）等于辩证法的认识之本质。”毛泽东同志许多著作，例如：“星星之火，可以燎原”，“论反对日本帝国主义的策略”，“中国革命战争的战略问题”，“中国共产党在抗日时期的任务”，“上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务”，“抗日游击战争的战略问题”，“论持久战”，“统一战线中的独立自主问题”，“战争和战略问题”，“中国革命和中国共产党”，“新民主主义论”，“目前抗日统一战线中的策略问题”，“论政策”，“关于打退第二次反共高潮的总结”，“目前形势和我们的任务”，“论联合政府”，“论人民民主专政”这些等等著名的论著，其特点也正在善于展开现实性诸要素之全部总和。他先分析事物矛盾发展的最初状态，随而一步又一步地，一层又一层地深入暴露现实的一切方面、各个方面的互相交错和互相推移，而达到关于解决矛盾的结论。
    毛泽东同志在抗日战争初期的“论持久战”和抗日战争中期的“新民主主义论”的所以能够吸引中国的人心，使无数的中国人在困难与迷途中看到自己的光明，就是因为这些著作展开了现实性诸要素之全部总和。他对于当时具体的矛盾运动的各个方面，各个部分，各种关系，给予了天才的分析与综合，从头至尾地交织着革命的生活的辩证法，因而使得人们认为他的思想是不可抵抗的。
    在整个抗日时期中，毛泽东同志关于政策问题的那些论著，纵横屈伸地分析各种矛盾，并根据对方的各种矛盾的方面而提出各种差别的对策，完全显出马克思列宁主义的辩证法的非常出色的活泼泼的力量。
    毛泽东同志之所以能够那样出色地运用马克思列宁主义的辩证法以解决中国革命的问题，很明显地，那是因为他是在战斗中过生活，他为人民的斗争而研究辩证法，并用辩证法去和各种论敌作坚定的斗争。
    斯大林在“论列宁主义基础”一书上曾提到马克思自己所说的：辩证方法“在实质上是批判的革命的学说”。同时指出：“列宁的方法就是彻头彻尾都为这种批判的革命的精神所贯注的”。斯大林在
    “论辩证唯物论和历史唯物论”一书上说到辩证法这一个字的原来含义就是进行论战。他指出：“古代人所谓辩证法，就是借助于揭露对方议论中的矛盾并克服这些矛盾来求得真理的方术”。整个马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的著作所贯串的辩证法精神就是斗争的精神。没有斗争就没有辩证法。因此，任何学究决不可能懂得唯物辩证法。
    毛泽东同志著作的经历，就是他应用唯物辩证法去和人民的敌人作斗争以及和党内各种错误思想作斗争的经历，而他在斗争中又随时吸引人民斗争的力量以增强唯物辩证法的思想。毛泽东同志在“论持久战”里面说到“自觉的能动性”。毫无疑问：凡是在革命中能够高度地发挥自觉的能动性的，便是他能够和当前具体的斗争结合起来而高度地运用唯物辩证法。
    毛泽东同志的著作“矛盾论”本身就是一个伟大的战斗的著作，它的发表，对于我们有伟大的新的意义。它将使得我们更加懂得必须如何去学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的著作，更加懂得必须如何去学习毛泽东同志的著作。它给我们以工作的尖锐的武器，将使得我们在各个工作岗位上，更加懂得必须如何去分析具体的问题和解决具体的问题，而促进我们伟大的人民共和国在政治、经济与文化思想各个方面的新胜利。
    “矛盾论”的发表，实际上也是对于我们现在所表现的力量不足和生气不足的学术界，给予了一个当头的批判。我认为我国的广大革命干部和知识分子必须熟读毛泽东同志这个著作，从那里得到启发。如果他们中还有如像教条主义者“从来不用脑筋具体地分析任何事物”的作风，那就应当抛弃这种作风，而根据毛泽东同志的指示，开动自己的脑筋，在思想战线上和学术上认真地有所作为，以符合我们党和我们人民的希望。
