In the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors, on the one hand, stubbornly and unreasonably insisted on their absurd proposition of forcibly detaining our captured personnel to hinder the realization of the Korean armistice. On the other hand, they shamelessly uttered absurd remarks to defend their absurd proposition. The speech made by the chief American negotiator, Joy, at the negotiation meeting on the 11th was another concentrated expression of this shameless lie.

In his speech, Joy actually described our consistent and solemn attitude toward the issue of prisoners of war as our "unwillingness to face the inherent rights of the individual," and put forward the absurd propositions of so-called "open and jointly confirmed screening" and so-called "fair confirmation of the screening process." Obviously, Joy is trying to reverse the truth with arrogant clamor and find a market for their absurd proposition of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. However, the bloody atrocities committed by the American aggressors in the Korean prisoner-of-war camps have fully proved that the absurd proposition of forcibly detaining prisoners of war that they insisted on is just a synonym for their inhuman trampling on human rights and large-scale massacre and enslavement of our captured personnel. Therefore, the lies of Joy and his ilk cannot but be completely bankrupt.

People all know that the best way to respect the "inherent rights of the individual" of prisoners of war is to give prisoners of war humane treatment in prisoner-of-war camps, protect prisoners of war from abuse, threats, insults or physical harm, and release and repatriate all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, so that they can return to their homes and live a peaceful and happy life again. However, the American aggressors not only violated all humanitarian principles in the prisoner-of-war camps, forcing our captured personnel to tattoo characters, forcing them to write blood letters, and massacring them on a large scale, but also attempted to detain a large number of our captured personnel after the armistice was realized and send them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandits to serve as cannon fodder. Facts have proved that the American aggressors completely disregarded the wishes of the prisoners of war and continued to create human tragedies. Where is there any shadow of "inherent rights of the individual"!

In the negotiations on the fourth item on the agenda of the Korean armistice negotiations, we have always advocated that both parties release and repatriate all prisoners of war after the armistice agreement is reached, so that they can reunite with their beloved families as soon as possible. Moreover, not only that, in order to further take care of the wishes of all prisoners of war to be able to go home and live a peaceful life, on March 27, we also proposed a compromise plan on the principle of repatriating prisoners of war, stipulating that the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the captured personnel of the United Nations forces must be repatriated in full; The captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the captured personnel of the South Korean Army, who originally came from or whose families were in the areas controlled by their own army, must also be repatriated in full; And the Korean prisoners of war on both sides whose original place of origin or family is in the area of the receiving party, if they themselves request to go home and live a peaceful life, may not be repatriated. People can clearly see that our fair proposition is completely reasonable and completely in line with the individual interests of the prisoners of war. Facts have proved that only we truly respect the "inherent rights of the individual" of prisoners of war.

The darkness and terror of the American aggressors in the Korean prisoner-of-war camps are known to the world; In order to create an excuse for forcibly detaining our captured personnel, they even imposed "screening" on our captured personnel in their prisoner-of-war camps. After the American agents beat or fainted our captured personnel, they pulled the fingers of our captured personnel and dipped them in blood to put fingerprints on the list of so-called "unwilling to be forcibly repatriated"; Some were even used by American agents to dip their own fingers in the blood of the injured to make fake fingerprints. This brutal and shameless practice of the American aggressors aroused the unbearable anger and resistance of our captured personnel. Our captured personnel detained on Geoje Island once detained the American prisoner-of-war camp commander Dodd in a state of indignation on the 7th of this month. This is just one of many facts that our captured personnel have risen up to resist the American murderers who forcibly carried out the so-called "screening" of our captured personnel by means of massacre. However, this is enough to explain what kind of bloody crime the "respect" for the "inherent rights of the individual" of prisoners of war in the mouths of Joy and his ilk is.

The American aggressors' forcible "screening" of prisoners of war is a fundamental violation of the provisions of the Geneva Convention, and we cannot recognize it at all; and the so-called "re-screening" by Joy and his ilk is even more doubly absurd. As for the bloody incidents created by the US side in an attempt to forcibly detain our captured personnel, they have long been known to the world, and even the reports of American reporters and the confessions of American airborne agents have confirmed this, so it is obviously unnecessary to conduct any investigation. In the face of ironclad facts, what qualifications do the American aggressors have to propose any "open and jointly confirmed screening" and any "fair confirmation of the screening process"?

The absurd proposition of the American aggressors to forcibly detain our captured personnel, no matter how many tricks it changes, has absolutely no market for people who know the truth of the facts and have a little sense of justice. The peace-loving people all over the world and the prisoners of war on both sides of the Korean War all know that the stalemate in the Korean negotiations was created entirely by the US side; It is impossible for the American aggressors to shirk their responsibility for delaying and undermining the Korean armistice negotiations.

### 美方谈判代表的无耻谬论是没有市场的

    美方谈判代表的无耻谬论是没有市场的
    在朝鲜停战谈判中，美国侵略者一面蛮横无理地坚持其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，来阻碍朝鲜停战的实现，一面又厚颜无耻地大放厥词，来为他们的荒谬主张进行辩护。美国首席谈判代表乔埃在十一日谈判会议上的发言，就是这种无耻谎言的又一次集中的表现。
    乔埃在他的发言中，竟然将我方对战俘问题所一贯采取的严正态度，说成是我方“不愿正视个人的固有权利”，提出所谓“公开并共同证实甄别”和所谓“对甄别过程公正证实”的荒谬主张。显然，乔埃是妄图以蛮横的叫嚣来颠倒事实的真相，并为他们强迫扣留战俘的荒谬主张寻找市场。但是，美国侵略者在朝鲜战俘营中所犯下的血腥暴行已完全证明了：他们所坚持的强迫扣留战俘的荒谬主张不过是他们灭绝人性地蹂躏人权，并大规模屠杀和奴役我被俘人员的代名词，因而乔埃之流的颠倒黑白的谎言，就不能不遭到彻底的破产。
    人们都知道，尊重战俘“个人固有权利”的最好的办法，是使战俘在俘虏营中受到人道的待遇，保护战俘不受虐待、威胁、侮辱或毁伤身体，并且在敌对行为停止后释放与遣返全部战俘，使他们归返家园，重过和平幸福的生活。但是美国侵略者不但在战俘营中违反一切人道的原则，对我被俘人员强迫刺字、逼写血书，并加以大规模的屠杀，而且还妄图在停战实现后大批扣留我方被俘人员，送给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。事实证明，美国侵略者完全不顾战俘个人的愿望，而不断制造着人间的惨剧，这那里有什么“个人固有权利”的丝毫影子呢！
    在朝鲜停战谈判的第四项议程的谈判中，我方自始至终主张在停战协议达成后，双方释放与遣返全部战俘，使他们与亲爱的家人得以早日团聚。而且不仅如此，我方为了进一步照顾所有的战俘都能够回家过和平生活的愿望，在三月二十七日又曾对遣返战俘原则提出一个折衷方案，规定中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，和联合国军的被俘人员，必须全部遣返；朝鲜人民军的被俘人员，和南朝鲜军队的被俘人员，凡原籍或家庭在其本方军队控制地区内者亦须全部遣返；而双方朝鲜籍战俘之原籍或家庭在收容一方地区内者，如本人要求回家过和平生活者，可以不必遣返。人们可以清楚地看出：我方的这个公正主张是完全合情合理的，是完全符合战俘的个人利益的。事实证明只有我方是真正尊重战俘“个人固有权利”的。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战俘营的黑暗和恐怖是举世皆知的；他们为了制造强迫扣留我方被俘人员的藉口，在他们的俘虏营中竟对我被俘人员横加“甄别”。美国特务把我被俘人员打伤或打昏之后，拉着我被俘人员的手指蘸着血，在他们所谓
    “不愿强行遣返”的名单上打指印；有的甚至由美国特务用自己的手指蘸着受伤者的血去盖假的指印。美国侵略者的这种残暴无耻的做法，激起了我方被俘人员忍无可忍的愤怒反抗，被拘在巨济岛的我方被俘人员于本月七日在激愤的情况下一度扣留了美方俘虏营长官杜德。这不过是我被俘人员奋起反抗美国杀人犯以屠杀手段对我被俘人员强迫进行所谓“甄别”的许多事实中的一件。然而这已足以说明乔埃之流口中所说的“尊重”战俘“个人的固有权利”是怎样的一种血腥罪行了。
    美国侵略者对战俘强行“甄别”是根本违反日内瓦公约的规定的，我方根本不能予以承认；而乔埃之流的所谓“重新甄别”则更是双倍的荒谬了。至于美方企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员而制造的血腥事件，早已为世人所共知，连美方记者的报道和美国空降特务的供词也予以证实了，这显然是不必要进行任何调查的。在铁的事实面前，美国侵略者还有什么资格提出什么“公开并共同证实甄别”和什么“对甄别过程公正证实”呢？
    美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，不管它改变多少花样，对于稍知事实真情和稍有正义感的人们，都是绝对没有市场的。全世界爱好和平的人民以及朝鲜战争中的双方战俘都完全晓得朝鲜谈判的僵局是由美方所一手造成的；美国侵略者要想推卸他们拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的责任是决不可能的。
