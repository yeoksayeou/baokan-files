To Help Some Cotton Farmers Solve Production Difficulties
The Ministry of Trade Allocates a Large Quantity of Goods to Entrust Cooperatives to Pre-Purchase Cotton

In 1951, the trade departments and cooperatives' cotton pre-purchase work provided cotton farmers with considerable benefits from cotton production to sales, as well as in purchasing materials. The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council instructed all regions to continue pre-purchasing cotton from cotton farmers this year. The Central Trade Department has followed these instructions and allocated 500,000 bolts of fine cloth, 300 million jin of soybeans, and 250,000 tons of coal, entrusting the All-China Federation of Cooperatives to use them for "pre-purchase with actual payment" for cotton farmers in disaster areas and those with genuine difficulties, in order to help these cotton farmers solve their production difficulties.

After consultation between the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and the Central Trade Department, it was decided that this year's purchase of cotton from cotton farmers will be mainly based on "credit pre-purchase," and it was stipulated that cooperatives and cotton farmers should sign pre-purchase contracts: cotton farmers guarantee to sell a certain amount of cotton to the state after the cotton is harvested; cooperatives guarantee to purchase at the state-set price. At the same time, based on the principle of meeting both state needs and people's needs, cotton farmers can submit order forms to the cooperatives when pre-selling cotton to the state; cooperatives guarantee to give priority to supplying the goods listed on the order forms. Through this organized and planned supply and marketing relationship, the economy of cities and villages, industry and agriculture, the state and individuals, can be more closely integrated.

    帮助部分棉农解决生产的困难
    贸易部拨出大量实物委托合作社预购棉花
    一九五一年贸易部门和合作社的棉花预购工作，使棉农从生产到销售棉花，以及购买物资上，都得到了不少的实惠。政务院财政经济委员会曾指示各地，今年仍继续向棉农进行预购棉花。中央贸易部已遵照指示，拨出细布五十万匹、大豆三亿斤、煤二十五万吨，委托中华全国合作总社，作为向灾区及确有困难的棉农进行“预购付实”之用，以帮助这一部分棉农解决生产上的困难。
    经中华全国合作总社、中央贸易部商定，今年向棉农购买棉花，以“信用预购”为主，并规定由合作社和棉农签订预购合同：棉农保证在收棉后以一定数量的棉花售予国家；合作社保证按国家牌价进行收购。同时，根据国有民需的原则，棉农在向国家预售棉花时，可向合作社提出定货单；合作社保证对定货单上所列商品优先供应。通过这种带有组织性计划性的供销关系，就可以使城市和乡村、工业和农业、国家和个人的经济，更紧密地结合在一起。  （中央贸易部国内贸易司通讯组）
