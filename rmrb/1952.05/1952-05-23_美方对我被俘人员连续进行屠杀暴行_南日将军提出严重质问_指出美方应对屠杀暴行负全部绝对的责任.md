Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 22nd: At the plenary session of the Korean armistice negotiations delegation on the morning of the 22nd, our chief representative first raised serious questions to the other side regarding the continuous atrocities of slaughter committed against our captured personnel by the other side in the past week. According to the other side's official reports, on May 15th, the other side shot and wounded one of our captured personnel; on May 17th, the other side shot and killed one of our captured personnel; and on May 20th, the other side carried out a large-scale massacre of our captured personnel in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, resulting in 86 casualties. At the meeting on the 22nd, the other side's Joy not only continued to refuse to answer our questions but also completely distorted the facts, lavishly talking about "sincerity for armistice," "noble goals," and "humanitarian principles." Joy also stated in his speech that the position of chief representative of the other side's armistice negotiations would soon be taken over by Major General Harrison. After Joy's speech, he left the meeting, and Harrison took over as the other side's chief representative. The meeting continued in the afternoon.

General Nam Il sternly pointed out at the afternoon meeting that the other side must bear full and absolute responsibility for every bloody act it committed. The history of more than ten months of negotiations proves that it is the U.S. side that is delaying the negotiations. No "noble" words can distort the unshakeable facts or conceal the essence of the other side's plan to detain our captured personnel as cannon fodder. General Nam Il's two speeches are as follows:

	Since our side put forward a completely reasonable compromise plan on May 2nd, your side has consistently refused to discuss it, attempting to force our side to accept your one-sided and unreasonable demands by presenting the Acheson Line proposal. When the essence of your so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" was declared completely bankrupt due to the public confession of your prisoner-of-war camp officers, your side at this meeting not only refused to give any explanation for the atrocities you continue to commit, and did not give any answer to our questions, but also flatly denied the facts, attempting to salvage your already completely bankrupt proposal. But the facts cannot be denied. It irrefutably proves that your so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" activities are your conspiracies to detain our captured personnel as your cannon fodder, to be used and enslaved by you. For a long time, your side has systematically and directly used the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Lee Seung-man agents to adopt various barbaric methods against our captured personnel, forcibly conducting screening and fabricating your so-called screening results to achieve your purpose of detaining them as cannon fodder. But our captured personnel would rather die than submit to your violence. Due to the resolute struggle of our captured personnel, your prisoner-of-war camp officers had to confess to the world that your so-called "voluntary repatriation" is forced detention; your so-called screening is forced tattooing and forced writing of blood letters; and the goal you are pursuing is to rearm our captured personnel as your cannon fodder. Can you deny the fact that your prisoner-of-war camp officers publicly admitted to subjecting our captured personnel to inhumane treatment, massacring them, forcibly screening them, and rearming them? Can you deny the fact that your prisoner-of-war camp officers publicly promised our captured personnel that they would no longer subject them to inhumane treatment, no longer forcibly screen them, and no longer rearm them? Can you deny the fact that yet another one of your prisoner-of-war camp officers went back on his word, tore up your own promise, and stated that he would continue to subject our captured personnel to inhumane treatment, continue to forcibly screen them, and continue to rearm them? Can you deny that you are now using open armed suppression to try to achieve your goal of forcibly detaining our captured personnel? Your prisoner-of-war camp officers openly used notorious Kuomintang bandit gang generals who have nothing to do with the Korean War as so-called Chinese prisoner-of-war problem consultants, jointly plotting to persecute our captured personnel. Your side dispatched a large number of troops to the location of your prisoner-of-war camps to further carry out atrocities of slaughter. According to your own official reports, on May 15th, your side shot and wounded one of our captured personnel; on May 17th, your side shot and killed one of our captured personnel; and on May 20th, in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, our captured personnel suffered 86 casualties. But your kind of lawless slaughter behavior not only cannot suppress the just resistance of our captured personnel, and cannot save your already completely bankrupt proposal, but on the contrary, it can only more fully expose that your so-called nonsense that our captured personnel refuse to return home to live peaceful lives is an utter lie. Ironclad facts cannot be concealed, and your full and absolute responsibility for every atrocity of slaughter and every illegal act cannot be evaded. Your already completely bankrupt absurd proposals of so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "screening" cannot be salvaged. You must completely abandon the absurd proposal to try to detain our captured personnel.

	The negotiations have entered their eleventh month, and no agreement has yet been reached. The entire record of the negotiations proves that the responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with your side. Your former chief representative boasted here this morning about how sincere your side is in reaching an armistice in Korea, but sincerity is not an empty word; it must be expressed through action. Your side's actions throughout the negotiations prove that your so-called sincerity is just an empty word. Everyone knows that shortly after the armistice negotiations began, it was your side that put forward the unreasonable proposal of a military demarcation line deep into our positions, hindering the smooth progress of the initial armistice negotiations. Everyone knows that it was your side that violated the Kaesong Neutral Zone Agreement, bombed our delegation, and interrupted the continuation of the armistice negotiations. Only because your side could not use military force to realize your unreasonable proposal in your so-called summer and autumn offensives, and under the pressure of the people of the world, did you have to return to the negotiating table again. Everyone knows that it is because your side insists on occupying Kaesong, interfering in our internal affairs, and trying to detain our captured personnel and a series of other unreasonable demands, that the resumed armistice negotiations have not reached an armistice agreement from October last year to the present. Your side has exhausted the good words of sincerity for armistice, but you have also done the bad things of delaying the negotiations to the extreme. And these facts cannot be overturned by any sophistry; they have been irrevocably written into the history of the Korean armistice negotiations. You say that you have the sincerity to reach an armistice in Korea, but since May 2nd, you have been taking an unreasonable, non-negotiating, and non-discussing barbaric attitude at this meeting. Is this your sincerity to reach an armistice in Korea? I want to point out that even in the same speech in which your former chief representative proclaimed your sincerity for armistice, you also openly claimed that there is now nothing to negotiate. This shows the world that your so-called sincerity is just an empty word. You are only trying to use the empty words of sincerity for armistice to cover up the truth that you are refusing to negotiate. You say that you are committed to the agreements that have been reached between the two sides, but just since May, your military aircraft have bombed and strafed our prisoner-of-war camps, wounding your own captured personnel, strafing our delegation's vehicles, killing our delegation's staff, and intruding into the Kaesong Neutral Zone to strafe. Is this your observance of the agreements? You talk about observing the agreements, but you do the opposite. You are not qualified to boast about your observance of the agreements at this meeting. You say that you are pursuing noble goals and humanitarian principles, but you insist on detaining our captured personnel. You subject our captured personnel to various inhumane treatments and repeatedly massacre our captured personnel. Are these your noble humanitarian principles? At the very moment when your former chief representative was proclaiming your noble principles, your armed forces were carrying out bloody suppression against our captured personnel. Your own news reports had to admit it publicly. It should be pointed out that no noble words can cover up the bloody acts you have committed. Now everyone knows that the only thing hindering the Korean armistice is the prisoner-of-war issue. The reason why the Korean armistice cannot be reached is only because your side insists on the absurd proposal to detain our captured personnel. Your absurd proposal fundamentally violates the natural desire of both sides' prisoners of war to return home to live peaceful lives, completely tears up the Geneva Convention, and completely destroys the spirit and essence of the United Nations Charter. But your side openly claims that it does not hesitate to forgo the Korean armistice in order to detain our captured personnel and send them to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Lee Seung-man group to be used as cannon fodder. From this, it can be seen what your so-called sincerity in reaching an armistice in Korea is all about. Our side has made great efforts to reach an armistice in Korea, and this is a fact known to the world. Likewise, in order to reach an armistice in Korea, our side will patiently negotiate with your side, continue to oppose your unreasonable attitude of refusing to negotiate, and your unreasonable proposals. But if you think that in this way, we will accept your absolutely unreasonable proposal on the prisoner-of-war issue, you are making a big mistake. We insist on negotiations, but we resolutely oppose your absolutely unreasonable proposal to try to detain our captured personnel. Our side has already rejected your April 28th proposal and put forward our reasonable compromise proposal of May 2nd, which is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue. Until now, the responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with your side. The next step in the negotiations also lies entirely with your side.

    美方对我被俘人员连续进行屠杀暴行
    南日将军提出严重质问
    指出美方应对屠杀暴行负全部绝对的责任
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二十二日朝鲜停战谈判代表团上午大会上，我方首席代表首先就一星期以来对方对我被俘人员所连续进行的屠杀暴行，向对方提出严重质问。根据对方官方报道，五月十五日对方枪伤我被俘人员一名，五月十七日枪杀我被俘人员一名，五月二十日更在釜山战俘营大批屠杀我被俘人员，伤亡达八十六名。对方乔埃在二十二日的会上，不但对我方质问继续拒绝答复，反而彻底歪曲事实，侈谈“停战诚意”，“崇高目标”，
    “人道原则”。乔埃并在发言中声称今后对方停战谈判首席代表之职即将由哈利逊少将继任。乔埃发言后即退席，哈利逊就任对方首席代表，会议于下午继续举行。
    南日将军于下午会议上严词指出对方对其所作的每一血腥行为，必须负全部绝对的责任。十个多月的谈判历史，证明拖延谈判者正是美方，任何“崇高”的辞句，都不能歪曲不可动摇的事实，不能掩饰对方方案企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的实质。南日将军的两次发言如下：
    自五月二日我方提出了完全合理的折衷方案以来，你方一直拒绝进行讨论，以提出哀的美顿书的方式，企图强使我方接受你方片面无理的主张。当你方所谓“自愿遣返”，所谓“甄别”的实质因你方战俘营长官的公开招供而宣布彻底破产后，你方在这一会议上，不但对于你方所继续进行的暴行拒绝作任何交代，对我方的质问不作任何的答复，而且矢口抵赖事实，企图以此来挽救你方业已全部破产的主张。但事实是不容抵赖的。它无可置辩地证实了你方所谓“自愿遣返”的主张，所谓“甄别”的活动，就是你方企图扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰、供你方驱使与奴役的阴谋诡计。长时期以来，你方有计划地直接利用蒋介石匪帮和使用李承晚特务，对我方被俘人员采取各种野蛮办法，强迫进行甄别，制造你方所谓甄别结果，以实现你方扣留他们充当炮灰的目的。但我方被俘人员宁死不屈于你方的暴力之下。由于我方被俘人员的坚决斗争，你方战俘营长官不得不向全世界招供，你方所谓“自愿遣返”就是强迫扣留；你方的所谓甄别，就是强迫刺字和强迫写血书；你方所追求的目的，就是重新武装我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰。你方能否认你方战俘营长官公开承认对我方被俘人员施行非人道待遇，屠杀他们，强迫甄别他们，重新武装他们的事实吗？你方能否认你方战俘营长官公开答应我方被俘人员，不再对他们施行非人道待遇，不再强迫甄别他们，不再重新武装他们的事实吗？你方能否认你方又一位战俘营长官背信弃义，撕毁你方自己的诺言，表示要对我方被俘人员继续施行非人道待遇，继续强迫甄别他们，继续重新武装他们的事实吗？你方能否认你们现在正在用公开的武装镇压，来企图达到你们强迫扣留我方被俘人员的目的吗？你方战俘营长官公开使用与朝鲜战争毫无关系而声名狼籍的国民党匪帮将领，充当所谓中国战俘问题顾问，共同策划迫害我方被俘人员。你方调派大量兵力到你方战俘营的所在地，进一步地进行屠杀暴行。根据你方自己的官方报道，五月十五日你方枪伤我方被俘人员一名，五月十七日枪杀我方被俘人员一名，五月二十日在釜山战俘营伤亡我方被俘人员八十六名。但你方这种无法无天的屠杀行为，不但不能压制我方被俘人员的正义反抗，不但不能挽救你方已经彻底破产的主张，相反地它只能更充分地暴露你方所谓我方被俘人员拒绝回家过和平生活的鬼话是彻头彻尾的谎言。铁一般的事实是不能掩盖的，你方对于每一屠杀暴行和每一非法行为的全部绝对的责任，是不容逃避的。你方已经彻底破产的所谓“自愿遣返”，所谓“甄别”的荒谬主张，是无法挽救的。你方必须彻底放弃企图扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张。
    谈判已经进入第十一个月，而仍未达成协议。整个谈判的记录证明，拖延谈判的责任完全在于你方。你方前任首席代表今上午在这里鼓吹你方如何具有达成朝鲜停战的诚意，但诚意不是一句空话，它是要用行动来表现的。你方在整个谈判期间的行动，证明了你方的所谓诚意，只是一句空话。谁都知道在停战谈判开始后不久，是你方提出深入我方阵地的军事分界线的无理方案，阻碍了初期停战谈判的顺利进行。谁都知道是你方破坏了开城中立区协议，轰炸我方代表团，中断了停战谈判的继续进行。仅仅是由于你方不能在你们的所谓夏秋季攻势中，用军事力量来实现你们的无理方案，在世界人民的压力下，你们才又不得不重新回到会议桌上来。谁都知道，是由于你方坚持占有开城，干涉我方内政，企图扣留我方被俘人员等等一系列的无理要求，才使复会后的停战谈判从去年十月起到现在，还没有达成停战协议。你方把停战诚意的好话说尽了，但你们却也把拖延谈判的坏事做到了尽头。而这些事实不是任何诡辩所能推翻的，它们已不可更改地被写入了朝鲜停战谈判的历史中。你说你们具有达成朝鲜停战的诚意，但你们自从五月二日以来，却一直在这个会上采取不讲理、不协商、不讨论的横蛮态度，难道这就是你们达成朝鲜停战的诚意吗？我要指出就是在你方前任首席代表宣扬你们停战诚意的同一篇发言里，你们还公然声称，现在已经无可谈判。这就向全世界表示了你方所谓诚意只是一句空话而已。你方只是企图以停战诚意的空话，来掩盖你方拒绝谈判的真相。你们说你们是信守双方之间所已达成的协议的，但仅就五月份以来，你方军用飞机轰炸扫射我方战俘营，击伤你方自己的被俘人员，扫射我方代表团车辆，打死我方代表团工作人员，侵入开城中立区进行扫射，难道这就是你方的遵守协议吗？你们嘴里讲的是遵守协议，你们手上做的是违反协议，你们在这一会上是没有资格来夸耀你们遵守协议的。你们说你们是在追求着崇高的目标和人道主义的原则，但你们却坚持扣留我方被俘人员的主张。你们对我方被俘人员施行各种非人道的待遇，迭次屠杀我方被俘人员，难道这就是你们的崇高的人道原则吗？就在你方前任首席代表宣扬你们崇高原则的瞬间，你方的武装部队正在对我方被俘人员进行血腥镇压。你们自己的新闻报道，也不得不公开予以承认。应该指出任何崇高的辞句，是不能掩盖你方所作的血腥行为的。现在大家都知道阻碍着朝鲜停战的只有一个战俘问题。朝鲜停战之所以不能达成，只是因为你方坚持扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张。你们这个荒谬主张根本违反了双方战俘回家过和平生活的天然愿望，彻底撕毁了日内瓦公约，完全破坏了联合国宪章的精神与实质。但你方却公然声称不惜不要朝鲜停战，而要扣留我方被俘人员，把他们送给台湾蒋介石匪帮和李承晚集团去当炮灰。从此就可以看出你方的所谓达成朝鲜停战的诚意，究竟是怎么一回事。我方为了达成朝鲜停战，已经作了很大的努力，这是举世共知的事实。同样为了达成朝鲜停战，我方还将耐心地和你方进行谈判，继续反对你方拒绝谈判的无理态度，和你方的无理方案。但如果你们以为这样，我们就会接受你们对战俘问题的绝对无理的主张，你们就犯了大错。我们坚持谈判，但我们坚决反对你方企图扣留我方被俘人员的绝对无理的方案。我方已经拒绝了你方的四月二十八日方案，并提出了我方五月二日的合理折衷方案，这是解决战俘问题唯一合理的基础。谈判直到现在，拖延的责任完全在于你方。谈判的下一步，也同样地完全在于你方。
