Resolutely Oppose the U.S.-Made Treaty with Japan, Support the Japanese People's Heroic Struggle
—Summary of Readers' Letters

    Readers have written to this newspaper in large numbers, strongly opposing the U.S. and the reactionary Japanese government's declaration that the illegal treaty with Japan has gone into effect, and expressing deep concern and enthusiastic support for the Japanese people's heroic struggle for independence and liberation.

    Zhao Jiaju of the Tenth District Committee of the Beijing Educational Trade Union wrote: "The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' announcement that the U.S.-made treaty with Japan has gone into effect most powerfully demonstrates that the U.S. government is stepping up preparations for a new war of aggression, placing the Japanese nation in a precarious situation. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country and peace-loving people all over the world." Yan Jinduo of Beijing Normal University wrote: We must not sit idly by and ignore the provocative behavior of U.S. imperialism in attempting to use Japan to expand its war of aggression.

    The readers' letters unanimously support the Japanese people's heroic struggle against long-term U.S. occupation, against rearmament, and for independence and freedom. Xu Jianguo of the Soviet Research Office of the Beijing Library wrote: We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism and the Yoshida reactionary clique: your fascist atrocities will not escape the judgment of the people of the world. The Chinese people and the people of the whole world are supporting the just struggle of the Japanese people, and the Japanese people's struggle for national freedom and independence will surely achieve final victory. All the students of Senior One Class A and Junior Three Class A of Beijing No. 3 Middle School wrote: We fully support the heroic struggle of the Japanese working people, and extend our cordial greetings to the families of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the just struggle and to the injured.

    Our country's workers and students express warm support for the strikes and class boycotts of Japanese workers and students against U.S. colonial enslavement. Zhang Cheng, a worker at the Tianjin Taiping Rubber Factory, wrote in a letter to Japanese workers: "The Chinese working class is constantly watching your heroic struggle. Your strike has increased our hatred for the Yoshida government. We express our highest respect and support to the Japanese people." The fourth-year students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University, in a letter to Japanese students, expressed their deep sympathy and support for the Japanese students' movement against the entry into force of the U.S.-made treaty with Japan and against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill." The letter said: "We are deeply concerned about your unyielding struggle together with all the Japanese people. In the course of continuous struggle, your ranks have grown stronger and stronger, while the Yoshida reactionary clique has become increasingly isolated."

    坚决反对美制对日和约  支持日本人民英勇斗争
    ——读者来信综述
    本报读者纷纷来信，强烈反对美国及日本反动政府宣布非法的对日“和约”生效，并对日本人民争取独立解放的英勇斗争表示深切的关怀和热烈支持。
    北京市教育工会十区委员会赵家举来信说：“美日反动派宣布美制对日‘和约’生效，最有力地说明了美国政府正在加紧准备新的侵略战争，使日本民族陷于危亡的境地。这是我国和全世界爱好和平人民绝对不能容忍的。”北京师范大学阎金铎来信说：对于美帝国主义妄图利用日本扩大侵略战争的挑衅行为，我们绝不能坐视不顾。
    读者的来信一致支持日本人民反对美国长期占领、反对重新武装和争取独立自由的英勇斗争。北京图书馆苏联研究室徐健国来信说：我们严正警告美帝国主义和吉田反动派：你们这种法西斯的暴行是逃不出世界人民的裁判的。中国人民和全世界人民都在支援着日本人民的正义斗争，日本人民争取民族自由和独立的斗争，必定获得最后胜利。北京市第三中学高一甲、初三甲全体同学来信说：我们以全力支援日本劳动人民的英勇斗争，并向为正义斗争而牺牲的烈士家属和受伤的人士致以亲切的慰问。
    我国工人和学生对于日本工人和学生为反对美国殖民地奴役的罢工、罢课，表示热烈的支援。天津太平橡胶厂工人张诚给日本工人的信中说：“中国工人阶级经常注视着你们英勇的斗争。你们的罢工使我们更增加了对吉田政府的仇恨。我们对日本人民表示崇高的敬意和支持。”清华大学机械系四年级同学给日本学生的信中，对于日本学生反对美制“和约”生效和反对“防止破坏活动法案”的运动，表示深切的同情和支持。信上说：“我们深切地关怀着你们和全日本人民在一起的不屈不挠的斗争。在不断的斗争中，你们的队伍已日益强大起来，而吉田反动集团却是越来越孤立了。”
