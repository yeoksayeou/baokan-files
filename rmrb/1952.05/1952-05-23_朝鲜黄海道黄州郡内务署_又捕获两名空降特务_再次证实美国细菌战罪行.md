    North Korean Hwanghae Province Hwangju County Internal Affairs Department
    Captures Two More Airborne Spies
    Further Confirming U.S. Germ Warfare Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd] According to the Korean Central News Agency, the Hwangju County Internal Affairs Department in Hwanghae Province, Korea, captured two Korean spies on April 17 who had been airdropped into the rear of North Korea to gather intelligence on the effects of U.S. germ warfare. The spies' confessions once again confirmed the criminal facts of the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare. The two spies are named Li Wande, female, and Wu Caize, male (names are transliterations). They confessed to having received six months of spy training at the Seoul Rhee Syngman puppet army intelligence bureau spy training center (affiliated with the U.S. military intelligence agency KLO system). On February 25, they were airdropped by a U.S. aircraft in Changshou Mountain, Jaeryong County, Hwanghae Province. Before their departure, they received forged identification papers from the Rhee puppet army intelligence bureau, and were given orders by relevant U.S. military personnel to gather intelligence on the effects of the U.S. military's germ warfare and the deployment of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, and to cooperate with the germ warfare by投放 poison in wells and small rivers in northern Korea. After being airdropped, they traveled between Jaeryong County and Pyongyang to carry out activities and poisoned wells twice. However, due to their suspicious behavior, they attracted the attention of the people and were captured by local internal affairs department officials.

    朝鲜黄海道黄州郡内务署
    又捕获两名空降特务
    再次证实美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社平壤二十二日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜黄海道黄州郡内务署署员在四月十七日捕获了两名空降到朝鲜后方为美国刺探细菌战效果情报的朝鲜籍特务。特务的供词，又一次证实了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪恶事实。这两个特务一个名叫李万德，女；一个名叫吴采泽，男，（姓名都是译音）。他们供认曾在汉城李承晚伪军陆军情报局间谍训练所（属美军特务机关KLO系统）受过六个月的特务训练。二月二十五日，他们被美机空投在黄海道载宁郡长寿山。他们出发之前，在李伪军情报局领到伪造的身份证明书，并在美军有关人员那里接到命令，要他们刺探美军进行细菌战的效果和朝中人民军队的布防情形，并配合细菌战，在朝鲜北部的水井与小河流中投放毒药。他们被空投下来后，即在载宁郡与平壤之间来往进行活动，并曾在水井中放毒两次，但终因行动可疑，受到人民的注意，而被地方内务署员捕获。
