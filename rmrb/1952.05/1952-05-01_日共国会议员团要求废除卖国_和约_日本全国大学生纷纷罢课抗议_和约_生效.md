Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: Japanese people are firmly protesting the entry into force of the separate peace treaty with Japan. On the so-called "Treaty Effective Date" (April 28), the Japanese Communist Party Diet Members Group issued a statement saying: We reiterate our determination to demand the abolition of the treacherous "treaty" and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Japan, and to liberate the Japanese people.

On the same day, students from universities across Japan protested the entry into force of the "treaty" and the anti-democratic "Subversive Activities Prevention Law," with the majority of students expressing their firm protest through strikes. In Tokyo, students at Tokyo University held a strike despite the authorities' prohibition and convened a protest rally on campus. The school authorities unreasonably locked the school gates, attempting to isolate the students from the outside world. However, students from Waseda University, upon hearing the news, rushed to the gates of Tokyo University, broke through, and joined the Tokyo University students in a victorious meeting, participating in the protest rally. The students also placed black mourning cloth over the two Japanese flags hung by the Tokyo University authorities to "celebrate" the "Treaty Effective Date," expressing their grief and indignation against the separate peace treaty taking effect.

　　日共国会议员团要求废除卖国“和约”
    日本全国大学生纷纷罢课抗议“和约”生效
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：日本人民坚决抗议单独对日和约的生效。在所谓“和约生效日”（四月二十八日），日本共产党国会议员团发表声明说：我们重申我们的决心，要求废除卖国的“和约”和美日“安全条约”，要求外国军队撤离日本，解放日本人民。
    同一天，日本全国大学的学生纷纷抗议“和约”的生效和反民主的“防止破坏活动法案”，其中大多数的学生以罢课的方式表示他们的坚决抗议。在东京，东京大学的学生不顾当局的禁止，举行了罢课，并在校内召开抗议大会。学校当局无理锁闭了校门，妄图把学生和外界隔绝起来。但是，早稻田大学的学生闻讯赶来，冲进东京大学的校门，与东京大学学生胜利会师，参加了抗议大会。学生们并把黑色的丧布放在东京大学当局为了“庆祝”“和约生效日”而挂出来的两面太阳旗上，表示他们反对单独和约生效的悲愤心情。
