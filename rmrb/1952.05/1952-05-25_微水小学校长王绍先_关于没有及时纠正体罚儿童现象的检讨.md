To the Editor: After I began working at Weishui Elementary School, I discovered that the teachers there were engaging in corporal punishment of students. However, because I myself also had strong feudal ideas, I did not pay serious attention to this matter. It was not until the People's Daily published its criticism on April 21st, and after an inspection by the leadership, that I realized this was wrong.

The phenomenon of teachers engaging in corporal punishment of students at our school is very serious. All ten junior grade teachers have used corporal punishment on students, and five out of the nine senior grade teachers have also used corporal punishment on students. Out of 670 students in the whole school, 200 have been subjected to corporal punishment or disguised corporal punishment. The types of corporal punishment include: hitting with hands, kicking with feet, beating with sticks, being forced to stand, being forced to sweep the floor, etc. Some teachers even wrongly said: "To teach students well, you can only hit them, you can't talk about democracy with them." This shows that their feudal thinking is very serious.

The reasons for these errors are, on the one hand, due to my insufficient leadership. When I discovered the phenomenon of corporal punishment, I did not wage a firm struggle against this erroneous behavior, but only offered slight "admonishments." Therefore, the phenomenon of corporal punishment continued to exist. On the other hand, it is due to our lack of understanding of the New Democratic education policy, the weak political atmosphere in the school, and colleagues disagreeing with each other, failing to fully utilize the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to seek solutions. Therefore, the improvement of teaching methods was hindered, and the erroneous phenomenon of corporal punishment of students was not corrected in a timely manner.

In the future, we must strive to study politics, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and continuously improve our thinking. In terms of professional work, we will study and learn democratic management methods more, and completely eliminate the phenomenon of corporal punishment.

Finally, in addition to expressing my apologies to the parents of the children who have been subjected to corporal punishment, I also request that the People's Government give me a punishment.

    微水小学校长王绍先
    关于没有及时纠正体罚儿童现象的检讨
    编辑同志：我到了微水小学工作以后，就发现该校的教师有体罚学生的现象，但是由于我自己也有浓厚的封建意识，所以对这件事没有引起严重注意。直到四月二十一日人民日报提出了批评，又经过领导方面检查以后，我才认识到这是错误的行为。
    我校教师体罚学生的现象是非常严重的，十个初级班教师都体罚过学生，九个高级班教师有五个人对学生用过体罚；全校学生六百七十人中，受过体罚或变相体罚的就有二百人。体罚的种类有：手打、脚踢、棍打、罚站、罚扫地等。有的教师甚至错误地说：“要教好学生，只有打，不能对他们讲民主。”可见他们的封建思想是十分严重的。
    造成这些错误的原因，一方面是由于我领导的不够，当发现体罚现象的时候，我并没有和这种错误的行为进行坚决的斗争，只是略加“劝阻”，因此体罚现象依旧继续存在；另一方面是由于我们对新民主主义的教育政策缺乏了解，学校里的政治空气薄弱，同事间互相闹意见，没有充分运用批评与自我批评的武器求得解决，因此，阻碍了教学方法的改进，错误地体罚学生的现象没有及时纠正。
    以后我们一定要努力学习政治，运用批评与自我批评的武器，不断地提高自己的思想；在业务方面多多研究和学习民主管理方法，彻底消除体罚的现象。
    最后，我除向被体罚的儿童的家长表示歉意外，并要求人民政府给我以处分。
