    The Japanese People's Struggle for Independence and Democracy
    Cui Qi
    Since the signing of the illegal separate "peace treaty" with Japan and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," U.S. imperialism's enslavement of Japan has become even more blatant. In February of this year, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries signed the "Administrative Agreement," and Japan was completely transformed into a "legal" colony and military base of the United States. Under the instigation of the U.S. military, the reactionary Yoshida government's persecution of the Japanese peace and democracy movement has become even more frantic. The Yoshida government recently formulated a series of fascist measures such as the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," attempting to suppress the Japanese peace and democratic forces, clear the way for arming Japan, and turn Japan into an accomplice of the United States in launching aggressive wars.

    According to the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," Japan is obliged to assist the United States in carrying out aggressive wars; U.S. troops can be stationed in Japan for a long time, can directly suppress the Japanese people, and can command the Japanese army and use any military facilities and any area; Americans enjoy extraterritorial rights and other privileges in Japan. The U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" stipulates that issues concerning the U.S. and Japan will be decided by the "U.S.-Japan Joint Committee" controlled by the United States. This so-called "U.S.-Japan Joint Committee" has actually become Japan's "supreme government." The "Administrative Agreement" also stipulates that the Japanese people must pay huge amounts of "defense burden-sharing fees." This means that through this agreement, the United States will not only strengthen its military control over Japan but also intensify its economic plunder of Japan. This will inevitably further impoverish the lives of the Japanese people and completely deprive Japan of its national sovereignty.

    The so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" is the "legal" basis for the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to intensify their implementation of fascist terror rule over the Japanese people. This bill stipulates that the Yoshida government will establish a "Public Security Examination Committee," which has the power to disband any organization and prohibit meetings, demonstrations, and the publication of newspapers. In addition, the reactionary Yoshida government has also formulated a series of anti-people and anti-democratic fascist bills such as the "Prohibition of General Strike Bill" and the "Special Criminal Law Bill." It is clear that once these fascist bills are implemented, all the basic rights of the Japanese people will be completely deprived.

    However, these sinister measures by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have now been met with increasingly strong opposition from the Japanese people. The recent major strikes by Japanese workers and the large-scale demonstrations by Japanese working people on the "May Day" labor festival are a huge development in the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. enslavement and fascist rule, demonstrating the Japanese people's strong will and strength to fight for national independence and democracy.

    Even during the "Administrative Agreement" negotiations, the Japanese people launched a patriotic movement against the humiliating sell-out of national sovereignty. On February 21, "Anti-Colonial System Struggle Day," Japanese patriotic youths held nationwide demonstrations, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the Administrative Agreement" and "Oppose the War Budget." After the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" was signed on February 28, the Japanese Communist Party was the first to issue a statement, denouncing and exposing the conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and pointing out that this traitorous agreement, which disregarded the Japanese constitution and the interests of the Japanese nation, was illegal and invalid. Other opposition parties in the Japanese Diet and many social figures unanimously condemned the Yoshida government for selling out Japanese sovereignty.

    While the broad patriotic movement against the "Administrative Agreement" was flourishing, the reactionary Yoshida government launched an attack on the Japanese people with fascist bills such as the "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill," which aroused even greater anger among the Japanese people. On March 1, 100,000 working people in Tokyo held a demonstration, protesting against the Yoshida government's traitorous policies and demanding the resignation of the Yoshida government. The "Joint Struggle Liaison Committee of the Diet," composed of the Labor-Farmer Party, the left-wing Socialist Party, the right-wing Socialist Party, the First Club, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, issued a statement on March 29, believing that this bill was "a preparatory step towards the restoration of Japanese militarism." The Farmers' Association and the Progressive Party also expressed dissatisfaction with this bill and worried about the revival of the fascist spy system.

    Because the Yoshida government's fascist bill is a serious attack on the basic rights of all Japanese citizens, the mass base for opposing this bill is exceptionally broad, encompassing people from all walks of life. The mainstay of this movement is the struggle of the working class. On March 31, the "Struggle Committee Against Deteriorating Labor Regulations," composed of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and other trade unions, decided to hold two 24-hour protest strikes on April 12 and 18, respectively. The Japanese working class launched a heroic counterattack against the vicious attacks of the reactionaries.

    The Japanese working class achieved a major victory in these two major strikes. On the eve of the April 12 strike, the reactionary Yoshida government, fearing the power of the masses, used lies to conceal the anti-democratic nature of this bill and attempted to use shameless intimidation to prevent workers from striking. However, the nationwide strike on April 12 was successfully held as scheduled. More than 400,000 workers participated in this strike, and about 2 million workers participated in the protest movement. On the eve of the April 18 strike, the panicked Yoshida reactionary government made superficial modifications to this fascist bill, attempting to use despicable deception to ease the anger of the masses in order to prevent the holding of the second major strike. But the Japanese working class immediately exposed this political deception by the reactionaries and shattered the reactionaries' conspiracy to divide the workers' movement. On April 18, the Japanese working class held a nationwide strike with even greater momentum. More than one million workers participated in this major strike, including thirteen major trade union organizations from important enterprises such as coal mines, electricity, automobiles, metals, private railways, and metal mines. This strike was unprecedented in Japanese history in terms of the number of participants and the scale. At the same time as the strike, more than 2.4 million people, including government agencies and state-owned enterprise employees, and students from Tokyo and other places, held rallies and demonstrations to support the striking workers. The Japanese people have become more united under the vicious attacks of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries.

    The April 18 strike paralyzed traffic in many parts of Japan and caused the suspension of approximately 400 ships in various ports. According to the Yoshida government's estimates, the strike by private railway workers alone caused losses of approximately 130 million yen. This major strike was an even more serious blow to the Yoshida government politically. Even Kyodo News could not help but admit: "The occurrence of this major strike in the weeks before the treaty is about to be concluded (referring to the illegal U.S. separate peace treaty with Japan formally taking effect on April 28) will have a huge international reaction."

    On April 28, the U.S. government and the reactionary Yoshida government announced that the U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan had taken effect. The Japanese people launched a strong protest movement with grief and indignation, designating April 28 as National Humiliation Day. On April 28, students from Tokyo and universities across Japan, disregarding the Yoshida government's prohibition, went on strike and convened protest rallies. Three days later, on "May Day," the Japanese working people held mass rallies in more than 480 locations across the country, with a total participation of three million people. Members of 54 industrial unions in Tokyo, as well as students and citizens, held rallies, demonstrations, and marches with 400,000 participants. Representatives from the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the left and right wings of the Socialist Party attended the rally. The participants unanimously shouted fighting slogans such as "Oppose war and rearmament," "Oppose the separate treaty, the security treaty, and the administrative agreement," and "Down with the reactionary bills." The declaration of the rally pointed out: The Yoshida government, in violation of the Japanese people's desire to establish friendly relations with all countries in the world, signed the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," plunging Japan into a position of humiliation and subordination. At the same time, in order to suppress the opposition of the people, it is formulating fascist bills, attempting to revive the notorious "Public Security Preservation Law." The declaration called on the Japanese people to wage a resolute struggle to crush the offensive of the reactionaries. The spirited participants held a demonstration march after the meeting. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries were panic-stricken in the face of the powerful people's ranks and dispatched thousands of U.S. troops and tens of thousands of Japanese police and secret agents to carry out a bloody massacre of the demonstrators. According to incomplete statistics, in this tragedy, in Tokyo alone, 500 to 600 innocent people were killed or injured, and more than 200 people were injured in Kyoto. This crazy atrocity by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries fully demonstrates that when their sinister conspiracies are thoroughly exposed and resolutely opposed by the Japanese people, they completely reveal their hideous faces and the nature of jackals. But the solidarity and strength demonstrated by the Japanese working people on "May Day" cannot be defeated by the reactionaries.

    In the period of less than a month before and after the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan took effect, the Japanese people held three nationwide strikes and demonstrations, which clearly seriously undermined the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries' plan to accelerate the arming of Japan.

    The heroic struggle of the Japanese people is a powerful action to defend peace, and it has won the support of peace-loving people all over the world. In his statement on May 5, China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and warmly support the struggle of the Japanese people. The Chinese people firmly believe that the great struggle of the Japanese people for the independence, freedom, democracy, and peace of their motherland will surely achieve final victory."

    日本人民争取独立民主的斗争
    崔奇
    自非法的单独对日“和约”和美日“安全条约”签订以后，美帝国主义对日本的奴役是更加露骨了。今年二月间美、日反动派签订了“行政协定”，日本便彻底变为美国“合法”的殖民地和军事基地。在美军的指使下，吉田反动政府对日本和平民主运动的迫害也更加疯狂了。吉田政府最近制订了
    “防止破坏活动法案”等一系列法西斯措施，妄图镇压日本和平民主力量，为武装日本扫除障碍，把日本变成美国发动侵略战争的帮凶。
    根据美日“行政协定”，日本有义务协助美国进行侵略战争；美国军队可以长期驻在日本，可以直接镇压日本人民，并可指挥日本军队和使用任何军事设施与任何地区；美国人在日本享有治外法权以及其他种种特权。美日“行政协定”规定，有关美日两国的问题，要由美国所操纵的“美日联合委员会”来决定。这个所谓“美日联合委员会”，实际上成了日本的“太上政府”。“行政协定”又规定要由日本人民缴纳巨额的“防卫分担费”。这就是说，美国通过这一协定，不仅将加强对日本的军事控制，而且将加紧对日本的经济掠夺。这就必然使日本人民的生活进一步贫困化，使日本国家主权丧失净尽。
    所谓“防止破坏活动法案”，是美、日反动派加紧对日本人民实行法西斯恐怖统治的“法律”根据。这一法案规定，吉田政府将设立一个“公安审查委员会”，这个委员会有权解散任何团体及禁止集会、示威、发行报纸等。此外，吉田反动政府又制订了
    “禁止总罢工法案”和“刑事特别法案”等一系列的反人民反民主的法西斯法案。很明显，这些法西斯法案一旦实施，日本人民的一切基本权利就完全被剥夺了。
    但是，美、日反动派的这些罪恶措施，现在已经遭到日本人民的越来越强烈的反对。最近日本工人的大罢工和日本劳动人民“五一”劳动节的大示威，就是日本人民反对美国奴役和法西斯统治的斗争的巨大发展，它表现了日本人民争取民族独立和民主的坚强意志和力量。
    还在“行政协定”谈判的时候，日本人民就展开了反对丧权辱国的爱国运动。今年二月二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”，日本爱国青年举行了全国规模的示威游行，他们高呼“反对行政协定”和“反对战争预算”的口号。二月二十八日美日“行政协定”签字后，日本共产党首先发表声明，指斥和揭露了美、日反动派的阴谋，并指出这一不顾日本宪法和日本民族利益的卖国协定是非法的和无效的。日本国会的其他反对党和许多社会人士，都一致指责吉田政府出卖了日本主权。
    当反对“行政协定”的广泛的爱国运动正在蓬勃开展时，吉田反动政府又以“防止破坏活动法案”等法西斯法案向日本人民进攻；这激起了日本人民更大的愤怒。三月一日，东京十万劳动人民举行了示威游行，抗议吉田政府的卖国政策，要求吉田政府辞职。由劳农党、社会党左派、社会党右派、第一俱乐部和日本工会总评议会组成的“国会联合斗争联络委员会”，在三月二十九日发表声明，认为这一法案是“走向恢复日本军国主义的准备步骤”。农民协会和改进党对这一法案也表示不满，并忧虑法西斯特务制度的复活。
    由于吉田政府的法西斯法案是对日本全体国民的基本权利的严重进攻，所以反对这一法案的群众基础就异常广泛，而包括了各阶层的人民。这一运动的主体是工人阶级的斗争。三月三十一日，由日本工会总评议会等工会组成的“反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会”，决定了在四月十二日和十八日分别举行两次二十四小时的抗议大罢工。日本工人阶级对反动派的凶恶进攻举行了英勇的回击。
    日本工人阶级在这两次大罢工中获得重大胜利。四月十二日罢工前夕，恐惧群众威力的吉田反动政府曾用谎言来掩饰这一法案的反民主的性质，并企图用无耻的恫吓手段来阻止工人罢工。然而，四月十二日全国规模的大罢工胜利地如期地举行了。四十余万工人参加了这次罢工，约二百万工人参加了抗议运动。四月十八日罢工前夕，惊慌的吉田反动政府对这一法西斯法案作了表面的修改，企图用卑鄙的欺骗手段来缓和群众的愤怒，以阻止第二次大罢工的举行。但日本工人阶级立即揭穿了反动派的这种政治欺骗，粉碎了反动派对工人运动的分化阴谋。四月十八日，日本工人阶级举行了全国规模的声势更加浩大的罢工。参加这次大罢工的有一百多万工人，包括煤矿、电气、汽车、金属、私营铁道、金属矿山等重要企业的十三个大工会组织。这次罢工，人数之多，规模之大，在日本历史上是空前的。与罢工同时，政府机关和国营企业的工作人员，东京等地的学生等二百四十多万人，举行了支援罢工工人的集会示威。日本人民在美、日反动派的凶恶进攻下，已经团结得更坚强了。
    四月十八日的大罢工，使日本许多地方的交通陷于瘫痪，使各港口的约四百艘船只停驶。据吉田政府的估计，仅私营铁道工人的罢工就造成了一亿三千万日元左右的损失。这次大罢工在政治上对吉田政府更是一个严重的打击。连共同社也不得不承认：“在和约即将成立的旬日以前（按指非法的美国对日单独和约在四月二十八日正式生效）发生了这次大罢工，在国际上也会发生巨大的反应。”
    四月二十八日，美国政府和吉田反动政府宣布美制的单独对日“和约”生效。日本人民以悲愤的心情展开了强烈的抗议运动，把四月二十八日作为国耻日。四月二十八日，东京和日本全国各大学的学生不顾吉田政府的禁止，纷纷举行罢课，并召集抗议大会。在三天以后的“五一”劳动节，日本劳动人民在全国四百八十多处地方举行了群众大会，参加者共达三百万人。东京五十四个产业工会的会员和学生及市民四十万人举行了集会示威和游行。共产党、劳农党、社会党左派和右派的代表都出席了这次大会。与会者一致喊出了“反对战争和重新武装”，“反对单独和约、安全条约和行政协定”和“打倒反动的法案”等战斗口号。大会宣言指出：吉田政府违背日本人民希望与全世界各国建立友好关系的愿望，签订了美日“行政协定”，陷日本于屈辱和隶属的地位。同时，为了镇压人民群众的反对，它正在制订法西斯法案，企图把臭名昭彰的“维持治安法”加以复活。宣言号召日本人民进行坚决的斗争，以摧毁反动派的攻势。斗志昂扬的与会群众，在会后举行了示威游行。美、日反动派在强大的人民队伍面前惊慌万状，竟出动上千的美军和日本的警察、特务两万数千人，对游行群众实行血腥的大屠杀。据不完全的统计，在这次惨案中，仅东京一地就有无辜群众五六百人伤亡，在京都被打伤的亦达二百多人。美、日反动派的这种疯狂暴行，充分说明当它们的恶毒阴谋遭到日本人民彻底揭穿和坚决反对的时候，它们就完全露出了它们的狰狞面孔和豺狼本色。但是日本劳动人民在“五一”劳动节所表现的团结和力量，是反动派无法挫败的。
    在非法的单独对日“和约”生效前后不到一个月的期间里，日本人民举行了三次全国规模的罢工和示威，这显然严重地打击了美、日反动派加紧武装日本的计划。
    日本人民的英勇斗争是保卫和平的有力行动，它获得全世界爱好和平人民的支持。我国周恩来外交部长在五月五日的声明中指出：“中国人民对日本人民的这个斗争，是深切同情、热烈支持的。中国人民深信，日本人民争取自己祖国独立、自由、民主、和平的伟大斗争定能获得最后胜利。”
