来信摘要 (Letters to the Editor)

    I Shouldn't Have Written to the Party Newspaper Without Investigation and Research
    Some time ago, without investigation or research, relying solely on subjective conjecture, I wrote a letter to the People's Daily criticizing the staff of the Beijing West Railway Station for not assisting in tax collection and for not notifying the tax office when changing unloading locations. I also fabricated facts, writing that I heard something from moving workers when I actually heard it from someone else. After the letter was published in the newspaper, I wrongly thought that it was only inappropriate to publish it in the name of an organization, and that the rest was correct. Later, I learned from my superiors that the railway bureau had notified us in advance of the change of unloading location, but I simply didn't know it. The situation I described in my letter was completely inconsistent with the facts. This error occurred because I did not treat revolutionary work with a serious and responsible attitude, and I did not use the weapon of criticism with a serious attitude. I wrote the letter based only on what I saw and heard, without conducting a comprehensive investigation and understanding. This was a big mistake. I must accept the lesson of this error and conscientiously correct this irresponsible work style in my future work.

    我不该不经调查研究就写信给党报
    前些日子，我没有经过调查研究，只凭主观臆测，就写了一封信给人民日报，批评北京西车站人员不协助税收工作，改换卸货地点不通知稽征所；并捏造事实，把听别人说的话，写成是听搬运工人说的话。那封信在报上发表后，我还错误地认为只是以机关名义发表不太恰当，其他的还是正确的。后来我从领导方面才知道，铁路局改换地点卸货是预先通知我们了，只是我自己不知道而已。我信中所说的情况都是不符合事实的。这一错误的发生，是因为我没有以认真负责的态度对待革命工作，没有以严肃的态度运用批评的武器之故。我只凭自己所见的和听说的就写了信，却没有作全面的调查了解，这是一个大错误。我要接受这次错误对我的教训，在今后的工作中切实地改正这种不负责任的作风。
    王德起
