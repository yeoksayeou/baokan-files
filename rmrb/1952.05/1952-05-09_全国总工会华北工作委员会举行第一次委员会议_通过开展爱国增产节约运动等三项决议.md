    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions North China Working Committee held its first committee meeting from April 15th to 23rd. The meeting passed three important resolutions: carrying out the patriotic increase production and practice economy campaign in 1952, strengthening trade union work in private enterprises, and thoroughly rectifying trade union organizations and strengthening grassroots trade union work.
    The meeting first heard reports from Liu Xiufeng, Vice Chairman of the North China Administrative Committee of the Government Administration Council, Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Kang Yonghe, Director of the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on the tasks of trade unions in economic construction. Everyone agreed that under the leadership of the Party and trade unions at all levels, workers and shop assistants in the North China region actively participated in the “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” movements. Over 90% of the workers and shop assistants in the region received class education in this movement, and their political awareness was unprecedentedly enhanced, and trade union organizations also greatly developed. Therefore, trade unions at all levels must, on the basis of this victory, immediately shift the focus of their work to the preparation for the increase production and practice economy emulation drive. In state-owned factories and mines where the anti-corruption campaign has ended, trade unions should cooperate with the administrative leadership to continue to mobilize the masses to oppose waste and bureaucracy. Workers should be mobilized to thoroughly expose problems from the main aspects of capital construction, business management, technology safety, and labor organization; and organize employees to help the administrative side complete the work of clearing assets and verifying funds, establish and improve various practical management systems, and formulate specific plans for each factory, workshop, and tunnel to ensure the completion of increase production and practice economy tasks. Factories and mines where democratic reforms are not thorough should conduct supplementary lessons in conjunction with anti-bureaucracy. The "Three-Anti" struggle within the trade union should be carried out thoroughly under the unified leadership of the Party. The purely technical viewpoints among technical personnel should be strictly liquidated through inspecting specific examples of waste, mobilizing employees to thoroughly liquidate the technical viewpoints of worshiping the bourgeoisie, and educating them to closely integrate with workers. The purpose of all this work is to find out the loopholes in the management and production process of factories and mines, and to formulate ways to overcome them and practical systems, so as to lay the foundation for carrying out the patriotic increase production and practice economy emulation drive on a regional scale. After the emulation drive is launched in June, provincial and municipal trade unions must strengthen their leadership over grassroots trade union organizations, focusing on work at the group level and strengthening workshop trade union work.
    The meeting believed that strengthening trade union work in private enterprises is a crucial key to consolidating the achievements of the "Five-Anti" movement and uniting and supervising capitalists in production. The meeting decided that the main task of trade union work in private enterprises is to assist the capitalists in restoring and developing production. While restoring production, trade unions should rectify their organizations, promote activists in the "Five-Anti" movement to take on leadership roles in trade unions, cleanse the running dogs who betrayed the working class, educate workers to abide by labor discipline, correct some excessive demands on welfare, urge capitalists to jointly convene labor-capital consultation meetings, and sign labor-capital contracts, so as to gradually achieve the goal of carrying out the patriotic increase production and practice economy emulation drive in a conditional, planned, and prepared manner. The meeting decided to establish district-level trade union organizations in Beijing and Tianjin, and other provincial cities should establish district trade union offices according to the actual situation to strengthen trade union work in private enterprises.
    The meeting finally decided that trade union organizations in public and private enterprises should be rectified, and grassroots trade union work should be strengthened. Trade unions at all levels above the city level must focus their work on leading grassroots trade unions, first of all, they must train grassroots trade union cadres and trade union group leaders in a planned way so that they can regularly go deep into workshops and groups to carry out work. Trade unions at all levels should convene representative meetings, fully promote democracy, and inspect trade union leadership from the bottom up; grassroots trade unions should conduct a general election in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" movement within the trade union, boldly promoting activists in the movement to participate in the leadership. Thoroughly change the work style of trade union cadres being divorced from employees, establish a style of going deep into the front lines, regularly understanding the workers' working conditions, thoughts, and living conditions, and solving problems in a timely manner. Provincial and municipal trade unions must train the newly promoted worker cadres in a planned and phased manner to improve their policy and business level.

    全国总工会华北工作委员会举行第一次委员会议
    通过开展爱国增产节约运动等三项决议
    中华全国总工会华北工作委员会在四月十五日到二十三日举行了第一次委员会议。这次会议通过了一九五二年开展爱国增产节约运动，加强私营企业工会工作，彻底整顿工会组织加强基层工会工作三项重要决议。
    会议首先听取了政务院华北行政委员会副主任刘秀峰、中华全国总工会秘书长赖若愚、中华全国总工会华北工作委员会主任康永和关于工会在经济建设中的任务等报告。大家一致认为：华北区的工人、店员，在各级党和工会的领导下，积极参加了
    “三反”“五反”斗争；全区百分之九十以上的工人店员在这次运动中受到了阶级教育，政治觉悟空前提高，工会组织也有很大发展。因此各级工会必须在这一胜利的基础上，立即把工作重点转到增产节约竞赛的准备工作方面去。在反贪污已经结束的公营厂矿中，工会应配合行政领导方面继续发动群众进行反浪费、反官僚主义。发动工人从基本建设、经营管理、技术安全、劳动组织等主要方面进行彻底的揭发；并组织职工帮助行政方面完成清理资产核定资金的工作，建立、健全各种切实可行的经营管理制度，订出各厂、车间、坑道保证完成增产节约任务的具体计划。民主改革尚不彻底的厂矿，应结合反官僚主义认真进行补课。工会内部的“三反”斗争，应在党的统一领导下进行彻底。对技术人员中的单纯技术观点，要通过检查浪费的具体事例，发动职工严格清算崇拜资产阶级的技术观点，教育他们和工人紧密结合。这一切工作的目的，都是为了找出厂矿经营管理和生产过程中的漏洞，并订出克服的办法和切实的制度，以便为开展全区规模的爱国增产节约竞赛运动打下基础。六月份竞赛运动开展后，省、市工会必须加强对基层工会组织的领导，作到面向小组，加强车间工会工作。
    会议认为加强私营企业中的工会工作，是巩固“五反”成果和团结与监督资本家进行生产的重要关键。会议决定私营企业中的工会工作，目前的主要任务是协助资方恢复和发展生产。在恢复生产的同时工会要整顿自己的组织，提拔“五反”运动中的积极分子担任工会的领导工作，清洗背叛工人阶级的走狗，并教育工人遵守劳动纪律，纠正在福利上的某些过高要求，督促资本家共同召开劳资协商会议，订立劳资合同，逐步达到有条件、有计划、有准备地开展爱国增产节约竞赛运动。会议决定：在北京、天津两市成立区级工会组织，其他省属市根据实际情况设立区工会办事处，以加强私营企业工会工作。
    会议最后决定：公、私营企业中的工会组织要进行整顿，要加强基层工会工作。市以上各级工会必须把工作重点放在对基层工会的领导上去，首先要有计划地训练基层工会干部和工会小组长，使他们能经常地深入车间、小组进行工作。各级工会要召开代表会议，充分发扬民主，自下而上地检查工会领导；基层工会要结合工会内部的“三反”运动进行一次普选，大胆提拔运动中的积极分子参加领导。彻底转变工会干部脱离职工的作风，树立深入现场经常了解工人的劳动条件、思想、生活情况和及时解决问题的作风。各省市工会对新提拔的工人干部，必须有计划地分批地进行训练，提高其政策、业务水平。
