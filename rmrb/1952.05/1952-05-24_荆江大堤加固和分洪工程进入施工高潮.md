The Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion projects have now entered the climax of construction. Three hundred thousand and seventy military personnel, civilian laborers, and technical workers have put forward the slogan of "racing against the flood" and are engaged in enthusiastic labor competitions with each other, working day and night on various construction sites.

As of May 11, the revetment toe riprap work of the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement project has been fully completed, and more than 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed, which means that more than 74% of the reinforcement project has been completed. The steel reinforcement and concrete pouring of the bottom slabs of the Taipingkou floodgate and Huangshantou control gate of the flood diversion project were also fully completed on the 11th. Military personnel and civilian laborers are now rushing to repair the slope protection works upstream and downstream of the two gates. More than 40% of the flood diversion project has also been completed.

A vigorous patriotic labor competition has been launched on the entire line of the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion projects, which has greatly promoted the rapid progress of the entire project. As soon as the competition movement began, good news poured in from various construction sites. The efficiency of steel reinforcement work for the bottom slabs of the floodgate and control gate, the most important parts of the project, increased by more than 150% within two or three days. Originally, it took 30 people more than 20 hours to reinforce the steel for one gate bottom slab, but in the competition, it only took about 10 hours. The fourth team of the steel reinforcement brigade actively studied and mastered scientific batching and clear division of labor working methods, creating a record of reinforcing one bay in seven and a half hours. The vast numbers of military personnel and civilian laborers who were digging earth and building embankments also put forward the slogan of "dig fast, carry fast, tamp fast" and launched a competition. On May 3, 1,480 civilian laborers in Yichang County extracted soil from a depth of four meters or more, and dug 1,837 cubic meters of earth by 6:30 a.m., increasing work efficiency by 100% compared to the past. The most arduous transportation work in the project also achieved significant improvements in work efficiency during the labor competition. In the past, the dockworkers' brigade at Taipingkou could only load and unload two tons of equipment and materials per person per day, but after May 1, the loading and unloading efficiency increased to more than four tons. The ships responsible for water transportation universally learned the advanced experience of the Soviet "train tow method" and implemented Jingjiang night navigation, which greatly accelerated the shipping turnover time. From Taipingkou to Yichang, a total of 330 li, it used to take a tugboat four or five days for a round trip, but now it only takes two or three days. The Huheng, Xingkang and other ships have even created a new record of one and a half days for a round trip.

At present, the patriotic labor competition movement on the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion project construction sites is continuing to deepen. According to the current project progress, the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement project and this year's scheduled Jingjiang Flood Diversion project tasks are expected to be fully completed by the end of May.

    荆江大堤加固和分洪工程进入施工高潮
    荆江大堤加固和荆江分洪工程现已进入施工的高潮阶段。三十万零七千军工、民工和技术工人，提出了“和洪水赛跑”的口号，相互间展开了热烈的劳动竞赛，在各个工地上日夜赶修。
    截至五月十一日，荆江大堤加固工程的护堤脚抛石工作已全部完成，土方已完成二十五万多公方，就是说，已完成了加固工程的百分之七十四以上。分洪工程的太平口进洪闸和黄山头节制闸两闸底板的扎钢筋和浇灌混凝土工作，也已在十一日全部完成。军工和民工现在正在赶修两闸上、下游的护坡工程。分洪工程也已完成了百分之四十以上。
    在荆堤加固和荆江分洪工程全线上，展开了热火朝天的爱国主义劳动竞赛，大大地推动了整个工程的迅速进展。竞赛运动刚展开，各工地捷报频传，工程中最重要的进洪闸和节制闸闸底板扎钢筋工作，两三天内工作效率提高了百分之一百五十以上。原来三十人二十多小时才能扎好一孔闸底板钢筋，竞赛中只需十点钟左右就行了。扎钢筋大队第四分队更积极研究掌握了科学配料、明确分工的工作方法，创造了七时半扎一孔的最高纪录。挖土培堤的广大军工、民工，也提出了“挖的快、挑的快，打硪快”的口号，展开竞赛。宜昌县一千四百八十个民工五月三日在深四公尺以下取土，六时半即挖土一八三七公方，工作效率比过去提高了百分之百。工程中最艰巨的运输工作，在劳动竞赛中工作效率也获得显著提高。太平口的码头工人大队，过去每天每人只能起卸两吨器材物料，“五一”后起卸工作效率提高到四吨多。担负水运的轮船普遍学习了苏联的“一列拖带法”的先进经验，并实行荆江夜航，大大加速了航运周转时间。从太平口至宜昌共三百三十华里，以前拖船往返一次需四、五天，现在只需二、三天，湖衡、兴康等轮更创造了一天半往返一次的新纪录。
    目前荆堤加固和荆江分洪工程工地上的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动仍在继续深入开展，按照目前的工程进度，荆堤加固工程和今年预订的荆江分洪工程任务，五月底可望全部完成。　　　（据新华社讯）
