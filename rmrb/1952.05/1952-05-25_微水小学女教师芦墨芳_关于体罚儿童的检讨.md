    Micro-Water Elementary School Female Teacher Lu Mofang
    Regarding Corporal Punishment of Children

    Comrade Editor: I have served as the homeroom teacher for two classes at Micro-Water Elementary School, with a total of ninety-one students in these two classes. Forty-four of them have been subjected to corporal punishment by me. On one occasion, student Li Wen imitated my speech in class, and I considered this disrespectful to me, so I hit him twice with a wooden stick. Student Gao Chunyuan accidentally broke another student's hand, so I made him stand for half the class period and slapped him once. Student Qi Junying took something belonging to someone else and wouldn't admit it, so I hit him twice with a stick, scaring him so much that he wet his pants. The children who were subjected to corporal punishment by me were very resentful and afraid of me. Student Gao Chunyuan never dared to come to me, and didn't dare to ask even if he couldn't read; student Qi Junying didn't dare to say a word when he saw me; student Cai Goudan didn't dare to speak up even when he needed to urinate. Apart from class time, the children didn't dare to see me. In the eyes of the students, I had become a very fierce person. How can I carry out the task of educating children this way? The loss caused to the children is incalculable. Upon examining this now, it is truly heartbreaking.

    The reason these mistakes occurred is mainly because I have a strong feudal mindset. I usually refuse to learn humbly, which has resulted in my being completely ignorant of the New Democratic educational policy, let alone knowing how to educate students ideologically. Furthermore, because I lack the spirit of serving the people and a concept of loving children, I only knew how to blame them when they made mistakes, rather than how to educate them. In the future, I will definitely correct these mistakes, thoroughly transform myself, and teach diligently, striving to be a people's teacher.

    微水小学女教师芦墨芳
    关于体罚儿童的检讨
    编辑同志：我在微水小学先后担任过两个班的班主任，这两个班的学生一共九十一人，受过我体罚的就有四十四人。有一次李文同学在课堂上学我讲话，我就认为这是对我不尊重，用木棍打了他两下；高春元同学碰破了另外一位同学的手，我罚他站了半堂课的时间，又打了他一巴掌；齐俊英同学拿了别人的东西不承认，我打了他两棍，把他吓得尿流满裤。受过我体罚的儿童，对我非常愤恨和害怕，高春元同学永远不敢来找我，不识字也不敢问；齐俊英同学见到我不敢吭声；蔡狗旦同学要小便也不敢讲。除了上课以外，孩子们都不敢见我，我在学生的心目中已成为一个非常凶恶的人，这样我怎能执行教育儿童的任务呢？这给儿童们造成的损失是无法计算的，现在检查起来，实在痛心。
    这些错误发生的原因，主要是由于自己有着浓厚的封建思想，平时又不肯虚心学习，以致对于新民主主义的教育政策一无所知，更不知道从思想上来教育学生。又由于自己缺乏为人民服务的精神，缺乏热爱儿童的观念，所以当他们有了错误时，只知责备而不知教育。以后我一定纠正这些错误，彻底改造自己，认真教学，做一个人民教师。
