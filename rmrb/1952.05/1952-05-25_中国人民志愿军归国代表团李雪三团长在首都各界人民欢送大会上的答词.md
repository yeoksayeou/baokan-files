Dear fellow compatriots from all walks of life in the capital and across the country, esteemed leaders, and comrades:

Today, our Volunteer Army Returning Delegation is about to bid farewell to you with excitement and gratitude. We are about to return to the front lines in Korea to convey the will and determination of the 475 million people of the motherland to support the front lines in Korea to our comrades. For more than four months since returning to the country, under the leadership of the China Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea and its various local branches, and with the encouragement and guidance of leaders at all levels, and with the care and love of the broad masses of people in various places, we have successfully completed our various tasks. For more than four months, we, together with the Korean People's Delegation to China, traveled across the vast land stretching from the Bohai Bay in the east to the Pamir Plateau in the west, from Hainan Island in the south to Heilongjiang in the north. We visited 28 provinces, 8 administrative regions, 201 prefectures, 11 autonomous regions, 1,054 counties and cities, and 390 townships. We delivered 5,589 reports, and over 36,608,000 people directly met with us and listened to our reports. We organized a total of 335 radio broadcasts, with an organized audience of over 15,340,000 people, and published 474 articles. We brought back materials and pictures from the front lines of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, and held exhibitions in 31 cities, with an audience of over 2.2 million. The broad masses of people in the motherland received us like their own relatives, affectionately calling us "the most beloved people," which made us feel warm and excited everywhere. On behalf of the Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and all the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and pay our highest respects to all the leaders, comrades, and compatriots of all ethnic groups.

After returning to the embrace of the motherland from the front lines in Korea, we worked and lived in tense and joyful days, as if we had entered a university of patriotism and internationalism education. We gloriously spent every minute and every moment. The motherland left us with unforgettable impressions everywhere, and everything left us with profound education. Every time we arrived in a place, the people expressed their heartfelt love for the Volunteer Army with grand ceremonies such as cheers, songs, handshakes, dances, and gifts. Whether in cities or villages, on plains or grasslands, along railway lines or in towering mountains, we could see actions of Resisting America and Aiding Korea and increasing production and practicing economy to support the Volunteer Army everywhere. When we went to Yaxian at the southern end of Hainan Island, there was a welcome procession of seventy-two li long, and many brothers and sisters of various ethnic groups came from dozens of li away to welcome us. In Xining City, Qinghai Province, more than 40,000 people lined up for three hours in weather with swirling yellow wind and dust. The leaders of Qinghai Province came fifteen li away to greet us, and the soaring cheers echoed throughout the Qilian Mountains and the source of the Yellow River. When we arrived in Zhuoni Autonomous Region, Tibetan compatriots from 300 li away rushed overnight to see us. Because of our arrival, on that boundless grassland, horses galloped, people cheered, and joyful songs and laughter rose everywhere. When we reported in Wanting, Yunnan, many compatriots residing in Vietnam and Burma rushed from abroad to Hekou and Mangshi to offer us gifts and flowers and listen to the reports. Such moving examples are too numerous to mention. Seeing the powerful lineup of millions of people loving the motherland and the Volunteer Army, we felt infinitely gratified!

Everywhere we went on the vast land of the motherland, we were given strong impressions and beautiful feelings. Our motherland has abundant treasures: the oil of Gansu and Qinghai, the antimony of Hunan, the tungsten of Jiangxi, the iron of Northeast and Northwest China, and the coal of North and Southwest China are all world-famous minerals. In the Changbai Mountains of Northeast China and the Songpan and Maoxian areas of the Kangzang Plateau, we saw the primeval forests of our motherland, which are rich resources for the national defense construction of our motherland. Our motherland is indeed the richest and most beautiful country in the world.

At the same time, we also saw the brave and hardworking people of the motherland, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, setting off a nationwide upsurge of increasing production to support the front lines in Korea. We saw the great worker brothers and sisters, under the call of Chairman Mao, carrying out a vigorous patriotic production increase movement. They worked hard day and night with selfless patriotic labor enthusiasm, regarding production tasks as their own combat tasks, and rapidly restoring and developing large-scale railways, mines, and factories. They humbly learned from the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union, promoted the working methods and operating methods of Kovalev and high-speed cutting, implemented the Hao Jianxiu working method, advocated rationalization proposals, and launched a movement to find tricks, so that new records continued to appear. For example, in transportation, the Li Xikui shunting method appeared, which greatly shortened the stopping time of vehicles at stations; in the textile industry, the Hao Jianxiu advanced working method appeared, which greatly reduced the amount of leather roller flowers. In the construction industry, the Su Changyou bricklaying method appeared, which increased the bricklaying efficiency of each technician to 128%. In the coal mining industry, the Ma Liuhai tunneling method appeared, which increased the production volume to 188%. The result of the workers' enthusiasm for labor has made my country's industrial production leap forward by leaps and bounds in a short period of two years. For example, the output of pig iron has recovered to 64% of the highest annual output in my country's history, steel ingots have recovered to 97%, coal has recovered to 69.2%, cotton yarn has recovered to 105.9%, and cotton cloth has recovered to 113.5%... These great achievements are inseparable from the improvement of workers' political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm. We saw worker brothers and sisters disregarding their lives and any danger in order to protect the motherland's property. When a certain electrical factory in Kunming was smelting copper, the reverberatory furnace broke down, and it was obvious that a furnace of copper was about to be scrapped. Workers Yang Zhigui and Lu Shengcai disregarded the danger to their lives, climbed to the top of the furnace to repair it despite the intense high temperature. Although their feet were unbearably scalded, when they thought of "protecting the motherland's property for Resisting America and Aiding Korea," they disregarded all pain and continued to insist on their work. The reverberatory furnace was finally repaired, and the task of 86 tons of columnar copper was overfulfilled. Last March, when a certain mining section of a certain industrial and mining bureau in Northeast China was carrying out production in full swing, it was suddenly discovered that a rock crack was about to fall on the top of the head. Communists Li Wensheng and Liu Honglin were anxious when they saw it. They thought: If it collapses and crushes the electric pick, it will not only affect production, but also cause a large loss of wealth to the country. The two of them disregarded all dangers and rushed out to grab the equipment. The electric pick was grabbed out, but the electric wire was still inside. They went in to clean it up, and the rock mountain collapsed. Two outstanding Communist Party members heroically dedicated their lives to rescue national property. The workers' enthusiasm for labor has accumulated a large amount of wealth for the country. Last year alone, the employees of state-owned and public-owned enterprises in the entire Northeast region, in addition to completing the state's production tasks, overproduced and saved more than 16,000 tons of grain, creating huge wealth for the country. What a great action! We received two bottles of self-made potassium sulfate samples from workers in a certain factory in Changshou, Eastern Sichuan, with a line of blue characters printed on them: "Quality exceeds the American empire." We also saw at the Chengdu exhibition that our motherland has produced refractory bricks that can withstand high temperatures of 1,400 degrees Celsius, high-voltage insulators that can withstand 13,200 volts, and the gears of boilers, motors, and copper water pumps made by Wenjiang Power Plant are better in quality than American goods. We have gotten rid of the colonial economic status of old China, defeated the blockade of American imperialism, and built a new independent economy for the people of China. We thank the worker brothers for creating a large amount of wealth for the motherland. Dear worker brothers, you are the true masters of the country and the most reliable supporters of our Volunteer Army. I sincerely thank you for your support to us. We will definitely repay you with greater victories. I hope you will continue to work hard and strive to restore and build a strong industrialized motherland!

At the same time, we saw the brilliant achievements of another labor force in the motherland, our farmer brothers. They are working hard with unparalleled patriotic enthusiasm on their beautiful land. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, they will gradually move from a backward and impoverished state to a happy road. Last year, the farmers of the motherland, under the slogan of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, increasing production and loving the country," set off a vigorous patriotic production increase movement and achieved great achievements. Liling, Hunan, increased its total rice output by 40 million catties compared with 1950. More than 2,360 agricultural labor models were emerged in the county, districts, and townships, including Li Chenggui, a special-class labor model in Xiafang Village, District 2, who produced 1,314 catties of rice per mu, and won the honorary title of National Rice High-Yield Model. When we visited him, he confidently said to us: "This year, I guarantee that the average yield per mu of rice will reach 1,500 catties." After more than a year of the Resisting America and Aiding Korea movement, the broad masses of farmers have become politically aware. We visited many rural areas and saw that they universally set off a high-yield competition movement. Since several national agricultural labor models initiated the challenge to create a high yield of 1,000 catties per mu, 10,100 farmers in Nanchuan, Sichuan, have responded to the challenge, and two-thirds of the farmers in Bishan have responded to the challenge. These vivid facts of patriotic high yield clearly tell us that there is a strong potential force hidden in our agricultural production, and the anti-aggression war on the front line has an infinitely huge backing. At the same time, it also points out the superiority of the new democratic system.

What surprised us even more was that Chen Yongkang, a nationally renowned high-yield rice model in East China, had a maximum yield of 1,433 catties last year. This year, he led a mutual aid team to guarantee that the average yield per mu of the 56.8 mu of rice fields in the entire team would be 1,000 catties, of which 3 mu would have a record of 1,600 catties. He researched and improved production techniques in terms of seed selection, rice transplanting, fertilization, and weeding. They scientifically calculated the distance of each rice plant and the yield of each ear of rice. Dear farmer brothers, we are very grateful for your patriotic actions to increase production and support the front line. We wish you greater victories on the production front by producing more grain and industrial raw materials for the motherland!

When we left the front lines in Korea, Commander Peng Dehuai repeatedly and kindly instructed us to do a good job of comforting the wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army who returned to the country for recuperation. We did it carefully. In hospitals and honor schools across the motherland, we saw some old comrades who had fought side by side on the front lines in Korea. They were well taken care of by the state and lived happily. Many local governments have built new classrooms, dormitories, and clinics for them, and even built libraries and cool pavilions... Many wounded soldiers told us: "Although our bodies are disabled, our thoughts are not disabled. I still want to learn culture well and do more things for the motherland and the people in the future." We saw that the wounded soldiers also played a model leading role in abiding by the government's policies and laws and responding to the call of the people's government. A certain honor school in Southern Sichuan also helped build the school in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production and practicing economy." Some wounded soldiers tried their best to actively produce, which deeply moved the broad masses of people. Dear wounded and sick soldiers of the Volunteer Army, you have made glorious contributions in the revolutionary struggle. I hope you will maintain your glory and carry forward your glory, and always be revolutionary fighters of the Mao Zedong era. At the same time, we would like to express our warm gratitude and respect to the governments at all levels, people from all walks of life, and medical workers who warmly care for, treat, and care for us.

When we reported the situation of the front line struggle to the people of the motherland, we also extensively consoled the families of martyrs and soldiers. The relatives said to us with incomparable excitement: "Please tell the relatives in the front! The people's government and the masses treat us warmly and thoughtfully. Tell them not to worry about their families, but to wholeheartedly defend the motherland and kill more enemies." We saw from all over the country that the people of the motherland not only fully supported the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people, but also warmly and thoughtfully took care of the families of martyrs and soldiers. Since the China Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea issued the "June 1st" call last year, and after the "August 1st" preferential treatment work general inspection and this year's Spring Festival support-the-army and preferential-treatment-to-families-of-soldiers movement, the motherland people's concern for the families of martyrs and soldiers and their unprecedentedly high patriotic enthusiasm are combined, which has greatly promoted the work of preferential treatment. Preferential treatment work committees have been established in various places, and the broad masses of people have included preferential treatment work in the patriotic covenants. The political status of the families of martyrs and soldiers has been unprecedentedly improved, their living standards are rising, and loving, respecting, and helping the families of martyrs and soldiers has become a noble social atmosphere. From cities to villages, regardless of ethnic group or class, the unanimous slogan is: "Everything for the Volunteer Army!" Every year during the New Year and festivals, the broad masses of people warmly congratulate and give gifts. Wuxi City, Southern Jiangsu, gave gifts to the families of martyrs and soldiers worth more than 1 billion yuan in the first half of 1951. There are 319 families of Volunteer Army soldiers in Changsha City, Hunan Province, and the government has introduced jobs for more than 70 of them. In the second half of last year, they also received more than 5,000 catties of comfort rice. Eight counties in the Yancheng Prefecture of Northern Jiangsu built 103,079 houses for the families of martyrs and soldiers. Eight counties in the Huaiyin Prefecture had more than 18,000 farming teams, which cultivated more than 550,000 mu of land for more than 56,000 families of soldiers. In Anguo County, Hebei Province, 90% of the children of the families of martyrs and soldiers have been enrolled in schools, and the political status of the families of martyrs and soldiers has also been greatly improved. At the same time, we met many glorious model families of soldiers who actively produced and supported the front lines. They all stood in the forefront in various movements. Zhou Hushi, a first-class production model in a county in Yunnan, is a production model. She proposed to challenge her husband who was fighting American devils on the front lines in Korea. Liu Shenyi, a 54-year-old family member of a soldier in Chongqing, said: "We saw in the newspapers that the atrocities of the US military are becoming more and more serious. The more we think about it, the more angry we get. I donated all my jewelry to buy medicines. We will never let the bacteria manufactured by the US imperialism kill our relatives. I hope the children on the front line will fight bravely, defend the motherland, avenge the Chinese and Korean people, and win glory for the motherland." This is not just the hope of one mother, but the unanimous requirement of the 475 million people of the motherland. Dear family elders, brothers and sisters, we will definitely fight more bravely in accordance with your hopes and will!

What makes us particularly excited here is the People's Liberation Army, the old brother guarding the frontier of the motherland. In the past two years, they have carried forward a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, overcome various unimaginable difficulties, and demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism and a spirit of hard work, which deeply moved us. The troops entering Tibet endured hunger and cold, broke through thousands of miles of snow, and fought against the primitive permafrost and stubborn rocks on the plateau at an altitude of 4,000 meters above sea level. Finally, they opened up the Zheduo Mountain and Que'er Mountain, consolidating and building the southwestern frontier of the motherland. The comrades stationed on the Yunnan frontier overcame difficulties such as diseases, fatigue, hunger, cold, and language barriers in the deep mountains and forests where people rarely visited and where miasma prevailed. They launched a "doing good deeds" movement and formed a deep friendship with ethnic minorities. We saw that the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang has built many factories on the desolate Gobi Desert and on the vast grasslands. Irrigation projects that can irrigate 5 million mu of fertile land are being built under the Tianshan and Kunlun Mountains, bringing happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang and creating endless wealth for the country. Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army, you have set a glorious example for us. We will learn from your glorious traditions and use a high degree of patriotism and internationalism to give the American aggressors an even heavier blow. Let us unite closely and jointly defend our great motherland!

We also witnessed with our own eyes the great victories of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements achieved by the people of the motherland under the call of Chairman Mao's "increase production and practice economy." Since then, the fine qualities of diligence and thrift of the Chinese people have been further promoted. The filth and poison left over from the reactionary rule for many years will be eradicated from now on, prices will begin to fall, people's lives will become more and more stable, and a large amount of national funds will be accumulated. Our motherland will enter a climax of economic construction. Because of this, we feel that our responsibility is even greater. Dear compatriots and comrades, we will continue to do a better job of "simplifying and practicing economy" to answer you. We will use all our strength to defend the victorious achievements of the people of the motherland and fight to the end to completely defeat the American aggressors and safeguard world peace!

Just as we were making reports in various places, the inhuman American imperialists spread a large number of bacteria and poisonous insects in Korea and the Northeast and Shandong of the motherland, arousing the anger of the broad masses of people in the motherland. Many medical workers have organized epidemic prevention teams and asked to go to the front lines in Korea. In order to support the Korean people and the Volunteer Army to completely smash the enemy's germ warfare, the broad masses of people have organized and urgently acted. Many scientists, biologists, and medical and health scientists have gone to the front lines of epidemic prevention, and health education and epidemic prevention work have been universally carried out in various places. The people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world have launched a righteous condemnation against the enemy. With such huge support, we firmly believe that the germ warfare conspiracy launched by American imperialism will be completely crushed in front of the righteous people!

What makes us the most glorious and most exciting thing is that our wise and great Chairman Mao met us on the 23rd of this month. We also saw Vice-Chairmen Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Premier Zhou. We are excited about the Chairman's good health, and we are moved by the Chairman's encouragement to us. We have added endless strength, and we will definitely bring this strength to the front lines in Korea and pass it on to every comrade on the front lines to win greater glory! We will definitely fight to the end to defend the motherland and defend our Chairman Mao!

Dear compatriots! Comrades! Let us sincerely thank you for your support to us. Our Volunteer Army Returning Delegation will definitely convey the glorious achievements and enthusiasm for supporting the front lines achieved by the people of the motherland on the production front, on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" fronts, and on the anti-germ warfare front, as well as the great enthusiasm for loving the Volunteer Army, to the comrades on the Korean front to improve the patriotic enthusiasm and fighting will of the Volunteer Army comrades.

Goodbye! Dear fellow compatriots from all walks of life, leaders, and comrades! We will definitely bring the strength you have given us into combat and work!

Let us hold high the banner of victory in Resisting America and Aiding Korea and march from victory to victory along the road pointed out to us by Chairman Mao!

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the great, sacred cause of Resisting America and Aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country!

Glory forever belongs to our great leader Chairman Mao!

Glory forever belongs to the great motherland and the heroic people!

Long live the victory of the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea!

    中国人民志愿军归国代表团李雪三团长在首都各界人民欢送大会上的答词
    亲爱的首都和全国各界同胞们、各首长、各同志们：
    今天，我们志愿军归国代表团，怀着兴奋和感激的心情，要和你们告别了。我们就要回到朝鲜前线去，将祖国四亿七千五百万人民支援朝鲜前线的意志和决心，传达给前线的同志。回国四个多月来，我们在抗美援朝总会及各地总分会的领导下，在各级首长的勉励和指导下，在各地广大人民的关怀和爱护下，顺利地完成了各项工作。四个多月来，我们协同朝鲜人民访华代表团，走过了东起渤海湾，西抵帕米尔高原，南达海南岛，北到黑龙江广阔的土地。我们到了二十八个省份、八个行政区、二百零一个专署、十一个自治区、一千零五十四个县市、三百九十个乡镇。我们作了五千五百八十九次报告，和我们直接见面听取报告的人有三千六百六十万八千余人。我们共组织了三百三十五次广播会，有组织的听众达一千五百三十四万余人，文字宣传四百七十四篇。我们从前线带来抗美援朝实物和图片，在三十一个城市中举行了展览，观众有二百二十万以上。祖国广大人民像接待自己亲人一样的接待我们，亲切的称呼我们为“最可爱的人”，使我们处处感到温暖和兴奋。我谨代表志愿军归国代表团及志愿军全体指战员，向各位首长、各位同志、各族同胞表示衷心的感谢，并致崇高的敬礼。
    我们从朝鲜前线回到祖国怀抱以后，我们工作和生活在紧张、愉快的日子里，仿佛进到爱国主义和国际主义教育的大学校里一样，我们光荣地度过了每一分钟、每一刻钟，祖国处处给我们留下难忘的印象，事事给我们留下深刻的教育。我们每到一个地方，人民都用欢呼、歌唱、握手、献舞、献礼等隆重的仪式表达对志愿军的衷心热爱，无论是城市和乡村，无论是平原和草原上，无论是铁路沿线或是崇山峻岭中，处处都可以看到抗美援朝，增产节约以支持志愿军的行动。我们到海南岛南端崖县去的时候，出现了七十二里长的欢迎队伍，许多兄弟民族同胞从几十里地以外赶来欢迎我们。青海省西宁市四万多人，在黄风弥漫，尘土四起的天气里，列队等了我们三个钟头。青海省级首长们，亲到十五里地外来迎接我们，高昂的欢呼声响彻了祁连山下和黄河之源的每个地方。到卓尼自治区时，三百里以外的藏族同胞连夜赶来看我们。由于我们的来临，在那无边的草原上，马在奔驰，人在欢呼，到处扬起了愉快的歌声和欢笑。我们在云南畹町报告时，许多侨居越南、缅甸的同胞从国外赶到河口、芒市来，向我们献礼献花，听报告，像这样动人的事例，举不胜举。我们看到千百万人民热爱祖国、热爱志愿军的强大阵容，我们感到无限欣慰！
    我们在祖国辽阔的土地上，每到一地，都给我们以强烈的印象和美好的感觉。我们祖国有丰富的宝藏，甘肃青海的石油，湖南的锑，江西的钨，东北、西北的铁，华北、西南的煤，都是举世闻名的矿产。东北的长白山及康藏高原的松潘、茂县一带，我们看到了祖国的原始森林，这是祖国国防建设的丰富资源，我们祖国的确是世界上最富饶最美丽的国家。
    同时，我们也看到祖国勇敢、勤劳的人民，在毛主席领导下，到处掀起增加生产支援朝鲜前线的热潮。我们看到伟大的工人兄弟姊妹们，在毛主席的号召下，开展着轰轰烈烈的爱国增产运动，他们以忘我的爱国劳动热情，日以继夜地辛勤劳动着，把生产任务当作了自己的战斗任务，迅速地恢复与发展着规模宏大的铁路、矿山和工厂。他们虚心地学习了苏联的先进生产经验，推广了郭瓦廖夫和高速切削等工作方法和操作方法，推行了郝建秀工作法，提倡合理化建议，开展找窍门运动，使新纪录不断出现。例如交通运输上出现了李锡奎调车法，大大缩短了车辆在车站的停车时间，在纺织工业上出现了郝建秀先进工作法，大大的减少了皮辊花。在建筑工业上出现了苏长有砌砖法，使每一个技工的砌砖效率提高到百分之一百二十八。在煤矿工业上出现了马六孩掘进法，使生产额提高到百分之一百八十八。工人兄弟姐妹们发挥劳动热情的结果，使我国工业生产在短短的两年内，一日千里地飞跃发展。例如生铁产量，已恢复到我国历史上最高年产量的百分之六十四，钢锭已恢复到百分之九十七，煤恢复到百分之六十九点二，棉纱恢复到百分之一百零五点九，棉布已恢复到百分之一百一十三点五……这些伟大的成就，和工人们政治觉悟与爱国热情的提高是分不开的，我们看到工人兄弟姐妹们，为了爱护祖国资财，而不顾生命和任何危险。昆明某电工厂在炼铜的时候，反射炉坏了，眼看一炉铜就要作废，工人杨治贵、鲁盛才不顾生命危险，冒着猛烈的高温，爬上炉顶补修，虽然脚下被烫得受不了，但他想起“爱护祖国财产，为了抗美援朝”的时候，就不顾一切烫痛，继续坚持工作，反射炉终于修好了，并超额完成了八十六吨柱铜的任务。去年三月，东北某工矿局采矿工段，在紧张进行生产的时候，忽然发现头顶上一块岩石裂缝将坠，共产党员李文生、刘洪林一看急了眼。他们想：假使塌下来把电镐压掉了，不但影响生产，还给国家损失大量财富，他俩就不顾一切危险往外抢器材。电镐抢出来了，电线还留在里面，他们又进去收拾，岩山塌了下来，两位优秀的共产党员为抢救国家资财，壮烈地献出自己的生命。工人们这样紧张忘我的劳动热忱，使国家积累了大量财富，单去年东北全区的国营和公营企业的职工，除完成国家的生产任务外，超额增产节约了一万六千多吨粮食，为国家创造了巨大的财富，这是多么伟大的行动！我们曾从川东长寿某工厂工人手里接到两瓶自制硫酸钾的样品，上面印着一行蓝字：“质量超过美帝”。我们更从成都展览会上看到我们祖国已制出可耐摄氏一千四百度高温的耐火砖，可负荷一万三千二伏特的高压绝缘器，温江电厂自制的锅炉、马达、铜水泵人字齿，质量都比美国货好。我们已经摆脱了旧中国的殖民地经济地位，战胜了美帝国主义封锁，建设了新中国人民自己独立的经济。我们感谢工人兄弟为祖国创造了大量财富。亲爱的工人兄弟们，你们是国家真正的主人，是我们志愿军最可靠的支援者。我衷心感谢你们对我们的支援，我们一定以更大的胜利来答谢你们，希望你们继续努力，为恢复和建设强大的工业化的祖国而奋斗！
    同时，我们看到祖国另一支劳动大军农民兄弟们的辉煌成就，他们在自己美好的土地上以无比的爱国热情辛勤的劳动着。他们在毛主席的领导下，将从落后、贫困的境地逐渐走向幸福的道路，去年祖国的农民在“抗美援朝，丰产爱国”号召下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的爱国增产运动，获得伟大的成就。湖南醴陵全年稻谷产量较一九五○年增产四千万斤，全县涌现县、区、乡农业劳动模范二千三百六十余名，其中二区夏坊村特等劳动模范李承桂，每亩产稻一千三百一十四斤，获得全国水稻丰产模范的光荣称号。我们访问他的时候，他充分有把握的对我们说：“今年保证每亩田平均产量达一千五百斤”。经过一年多抗美援朝运动，广大农民在政治上有了觉悟。我们曾访问了许多农村，看到他们普遍掀起丰产竞赛运动。自全国几位农业劳动模范发起创造每亩千斤丰产挑战后，在四川省南川就有一万零一百户农民应了战，璧山则有三分之二的农民应战。这些生动的爱国丰产事实，明确地告诉了我们：我们农业生产上蕴藏着雄厚的潜在力量，前线的反侵略战争有无限巨大的靠山，同时也指明了新民主主义制度的优越性。
    更使我们惊异的是：华东区全国闻名的水稻丰产模范陈永康，去年最高产量达一千四百三十三斤，今年他又领导一个互助组，保证全组五十六亩八厘稻田平均每亩产一千斤，其中三亩产一千六百斤的纪录。他从选种、栽秧、插秧、施肥薅田等方面来研究和改进生产技术，他们将每一株稻的距离，每一穗稻的产量都科学地计算出来。亲爱的农民兄弟们，你们这种努力增产支援前线的爱国行动，使我们万分感谢，我们预祝你们为祖国生产更多的粮食和工业原料，在生产战线上获得更大的胜利！
    当我们离开朝鲜前线时，彭德怀司令员一再亲切地嘱托我们，要很好的慰问志愿军回国休养的伤病员，我们认真地做了。我们在祖国各地的医院和荣校里，看到了一些曾在朝鲜前线并肩作过战的老战友，他们受到国家的妥善照顾，生活很愉快。不少地方的政府，替他们修建了新的课堂、宿舍、医务所，甚至还修了图书馆和乘凉亭……许多伤员同志告诉我们说：“我们身体虽然残废了，可是思想并没残废，我还要学好文化，将来替祖国替人民做更多的事情。”我们看到伤员在遵守政府政策法令和响应人民政府的号召等方面，也起了模范的带头作用。川南某荣校为了响应毛主席“增产节约”号召，还帮助修建学校的工作，有的伤员尽力积极生产，使广大群众深深受到感动。亲爱的志愿军伤病员同志们，你们在革命斗争中立下了光荣的功劳，希望保持光荣发扬光荣，永远做毛泽东时代的革命战士。同时，我们对热情照顾医治和关怀我们的各级政府，各界人民和医务工作者，致以热情的感谢和敬意。
    我们向祖国人民报告前线斗争情况时、也广泛的向烈、军属进行了慰问。亲人们以无比兴奋的心情对我们说：“请告诉前方的亲人吧！人民政府和群众对待我们热心周到，叫他们不要顾虑家庭，专心一意地去保卫祖国，多杀敌人。”我们从全国各地看到，祖国人民不仅以全力支援了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民，而且热情周到地照顾着烈、军属。自去年抗美援朝总会发出了“六一”号召以后，又经过“八一”优抚工作大检查和今年春节的拥军优属运动，祖国人民对烈、军属的关怀和空前高涨的爱国热情相结合，大大地推进了优抚工作。各地建立了优抚工作委员会，广大群众把优抚工作订入爱国公约里，烈军属的政治地位空前提高，生活水平正在上升，热爱，尊敬和帮助烈军属已成为高尚的社会风气。从城市到乡村，不分民族、不分阶层，一致的口号是：“一切为了志愿军！”每逢过年过节，广大人民都热情地祝贺送礼，苏南无锡市在一九五
    一年上半年给烈军属送礼价值十亿元以上。湖南长沙市有志愿军家属三百十九户，其中有七十多人已由政府介绍了职业，去年下半年还得到慰劳大米五千多斤。苏北盐城专署八个县，为烈军属修建了十万三千另七十九间房子，淮阴专署八个县有一万八千多个代耕小组，替五万六千多军属耕地五十五万余亩。河北安国县百分之九十的烈军属子女均已入学，烈军属政治地位也大大提高。同时我们会见了许多积极生产、支援前线的光荣模范军属，他们在各种运动中都站在最前面。云南一个县的甲等生产模范周胡氏，她是生产模范，她提出和朝鲜前线打美国鬼子的丈夫挑战；重庆市五十四岁的军属刘深一老太太说：“我们在报上看见美军暴行一天比一天厉害，越想越气愤，我将首饰全部捐献买药品，我们绝不让美帝国主义制造的细菌杀死我们的亲人。希望前线的孩子们勇敢地打，保卫祖国，为中朝人民报仇，为祖国争光。”这不只是一个母亲的希望，而是祖国四亿七千五百万人民一致的要求。亲爱的家属父老兄弟姐妹们，我们一定按照你们的希望和意志更英勇地战斗！
    这里，特别使我们感到兴奋的，就是守卫在祖国边疆的老大哥——人民解放军，两年来他们发扬着高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，克服了各种难以想像的困难，表现了高度的革命英雄主义气概和坚苦卓绝的精神，深深地使我们感动。进藏部队忍饥耐寒，踏破千里雪，在拔海四千公尺的高原上跟原始冻土、顽石做斗争，终于辟开了折多山和雀儿山，巩固和建设着祖国西南的边疆。驻守在云南边疆的同志们，在人迹罕到、弥漫瘴疠的深山树林中，克服了疾病、疲劳、饥饿寒冷及言语不通等困难，展开了“做好事”运动，与兄弟民族结成了深厚的友谊。我们看到驻新疆的人民解放军在荒凉的戈壁滩上，在茫茫的草原上，建立起许多工厂，在天山、昆仑山下正建设着能灌溉五百万亩良田的灌溉工程，给新疆各族人民带来了幸福，为国家创造着无穷的财富。亲爱的解放军同志们，你们为我们树立了光辉的榜样，我们将学习你们的光荣传统，以高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，给美国侵略者以更沉重的打击。让我们紧密团结在一起，共同保卫我们伟大的祖国！
    我们也亲眼见到祖国人民在毛主席“增产节约”的号召下，又取得了“三反”和“五反”的伟大胜利。从此，中国人民勤劳朴素的优良品质得到更大的发扬。多少年来反动统治遗留下来的污毒将从此根绝，物价开始下降，人民生活愈来愈安定，国家资金将大量积累，我们祖国将进入一个经济建设的高潮。正因为这样，我们更感到责任重大。亲爱的同胞们、同志们，我们将继续地把“精简节约”工作做得更好来回答你们，我们将以一切力量来保卫祖国人民的胜利果实，为彻底打败美国侵略者、维护世界和平而战斗到底！
    正当我们在各地做报告的时候，灭绝人性的美帝国主义者在朝鲜及祖国东北、山东等地撒布大批细菌毒虫，激起了祖国广大人民的愤怒，许多医务工作者纷纷组织了防疫队，要求到朝鲜前线去。为了支援朝鲜人民和志愿军彻底粉碎敌人的细菌战，广大人民已经有组织地紧急地行动起来，许多科学家、生物学家、医药卫生学家都走上了防疫前线，各地普遍展开了卫生教育和防疫工作。全国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民已向敌人进行正义的声讨。我们有如此巨大的支援，我们坚信：美帝国主义所发动的细菌战阴谋，一定会在正义的人民面前粉碎无遗的！
    使我们感到最大的光荣、最兴奋的事情，就是我们英明伟大的毛主席于本月二十三日接见了我们。我们同时也看到了刘少奇、朱德副主席和周总理。我们为主席身体健康而兴奋，我们为主席对我们的勉励而感动，我们浑身增加了无穷无尽的力量，我们一定把这种力量带到朝鲜前线去、并传授给前线的每一个同志，争取更大的光荣！我们一定为保卫祖国、保卫我们的毛主席而战斗到底！
    亲爱的同胞们！同志们！让我们衷心地感谢你们对我们的支援。我们志愿军归国代表团一定把祖国人民在生产战线上、在“三反”和“五反”战线上，在反细菌战战线上所取得的光辉成就和支援前线的热情，以及热爱志愿军的盛情，传达给朝鲜前线的同志，借以提高志愿军同志的爱国热忱和战斗意志。
    再见吧！亲爱的全国各界同胞、各位首长、各位同志！我们一定把你们所给予的力量带到战斗中和工作中去！
    让我们高举着抗美援朝胜利的旗帜，向着毛主席指给我们的道路从胜利走向胜利！
    为伟大抗美援朝保家卫国神圣事业而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    光荣永远属于我们伟大的领袖毛主席！
    光荣永远属于伟大的祖国和英雄的人民！
    伟大的抗美援朝斗争胜利万岁！
