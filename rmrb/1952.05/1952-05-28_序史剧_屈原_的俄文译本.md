    Russian Translation of Historical Drama "Qu Yuan"
    Guo Moruo
    Editor's Note: Today is "Dragon Boat Festival" - the anniversary of the death of our great patriotic poet Qu Yuan. We are publishing Guo Moruo's preface to the Russian translation of the historical drama "Qu Yuan" here. The Russian translation of "Qu Yuan" was published by the Moscow Foreign Literature Publishing House in 1951, translated by Dr. Fedlin.

    Qu Yuan was a poet of our Chinese nation who loved his motherland and people two thousand years ago. His position in our national poetry history is similar to that of Homer for the Greek nation, and his character is closer to that of Dante in Italy.

    He was not a mere poet, but also a politician with profound thoughts and a sense of justice. His era in China was precisely the era of transformation from a slave society to a feudal society. He respected the people and sympathized with the liberation of slaves. He suffered attacks from reactionary forces at home and abroad, resulting in his political failure and forming the tragedy of his life. He spent half his life in exile, and finally committed suicide after seeing his country broken and his family destroyed.

    His tragedy is a tragedy of the times. His political failure ultimately led to the demise of his motherland, the State of Chu, and his ideal of respecting the people was never realized. The people sympathized with him. Even today, on the day traditionally regarded as the anniversary of his death (the fifth day of the fifth month of the old lunar calendar), the Chinese people still hold commemorations for him.

    Of course, I wrote him as a play to commemorate him. I tried my best to use some fragmented information about him, coupled with the knowledge I gained from my research on ancient society, to organize his life. But I do not want to deny that there are many imaginative elements in it. For example, Chan Juan, the female disciple who was most loyal to him and loved him, and the guard who volunteered to be his "servant" and rescued him in the end, are all characters I fabricated. They can be said to be symbols of two kinds of poetic emotions or two kinds of poetic character. Chan Juan symbolizes the gentle and nostalgic emotion, and the guard symbolizes the passionate and struggling emotion. I let the former die mournfully. Qu Yuan underwent such changes after his exile; not only did his poems change, but his character also changed.

    But I wrote this play in January 1942, when the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries was at its darkest, and in the center of reactionary rule - the darkest Chongqing. Not only was Chinese society facing a period of transformation at a different stage, but I also saw many large and small tragedies of the times before my eyes. Countless patriotic youths and revolutionary comrades disappeared and were imprisoned in concentration camps. The Chinese Communist Party, which represented the people's strength, was blockaded in northern Shaanxi, and the New Fourth Army, another fraternal force led by the CCP, which had made the most meritorious contributions to resisting the Japanese imperialist invasion in Jiangnan, suffered great losses due to the encirclement and suppression by the reactionaries. All progressive people in China felt angry, so I revived the anger of this era in the era of Qu Yuan. In other words, I used the era of Qu Yuan to symbolize our current era.

    My writing in this way had an effect at the time. The publication and performance of the play received unprecedentedly warm welcomes from the progressive side, and unprecedentedly fierce suppression from the reactionary side. However, the era in China progressed very quickly. In just eight or nine years, China had become the people's China, so such a play quickly lost its significance of the times. Such a play, when viewed today, is as if it were a work from the era of Shakespeare.

    It is naturally a great honor for me that this play is being introduced to the Soviet Union today. The translator, Dr. Fedlin, is an expert in Qu Yuan studies. When this play was being written and performed, he was also in Chongqing. Dr. Fedlin knows best how I wrote this play and what the general response to the play was when it was performed. Therefore, Dr. Fedlin can be said to be the most suitable translator.

    But I am very worried that this play may not be welcomed by Soviet readers. The reason is as mentioned above: it tells the story of China two thousand years ago, and it quickly lost that meaning of symbolizing the present era. In addition to this, I do not have the talent of Shakespeare. If my worry becomes a reality, I should naturally be responsible. Dr. Fedlin has done his best, and I would like to thank him.

    October 22, 1950, in Beijing

    This preface was written a year and a half ago, and the Russian translation of the historical drama "Qu Yuan" was published last October. This March, I met Dr. Fedlin in Moscow. He told me that the Moscow theater community was planning to stage the play, and Fadeyev also expressed his support. Fadeyev also told me in person that he admired the play very much and that the characterization was very vivid, and that my "worry" was an overestimation. I am very grateful to our Soviet friends for attaching great importance to our outstanding historical figures.

### 序史剧“屈原”的俄文译本

    序史剧“屈原”的俄文译本
    郭沫若
    编者按：今天是“端午节”——我国伟大爱国诗人屈原的忌辰，我们特将郭沫若为史剧“屈原”俄文译本所作的序言发表于此。“屈原”俄文译本系于一九五一年由莫斯科外国文学出版局出版，译者为费德林博士。
    屈原是两千年前我们中国一位爱祖国、爱人民的诗人。他在我们民族诗史上的地位，有类于希腊民族的荷默，而他的性格更和意大利的但丁接近。
    他不是单纯的诗人，而同时是一位有深刻的思想和正义感的政治家。他的时代在我们中国正是由奴隶社会向封建社会蜕变的时代，他是尊重人民，同情奴隶解放的。他遭受到国内外反动势力的夹攻，因而在政治上失败了，形成了他的人生悲剧。他过了半生的流窜生活，最后看到自己的国破家亡，而终于自杀了。
    他的悲剧是一个时代悲剧。由于他的政治上的失败而终于招致到他的祖国——楚国的灭亡，而他尊重人民的理想也始终没有得到实现。人民是同情他的。一直到今天，在相传是他的死日的那一天（旧时太阴历的五月五日），中国民间对于他都还在举行着纪念。
    我把他写成剧本当然也是为了纪念他。我尽量地利用了有关于他的一些零碎的资料，加上我对于古代社会的研究所得的知识，把他的生活组织了起来。但我不想否认，这里面是有不少的想像成分的。例如最忠于他而且爱他的女弟子婵娟，最后救他出走的那位自愿作他的“仆夫”的卫士，都是我所虚构的人物。那可以说，是两种诗的感情或两种诗人性格的象征。婵娟是象征着优婉的怀旧的感情，卫士是象征着激越的奋斗的感情，前者我让她哀婉地死了。屈原在流窜后是有了这样的变化的，不仅他的诗起了变化，他的性格也起了变化。
    但我写这个剧本是在一九四二年一月，国民党反动派的统治最黑暗的时候，而且是在反动统治的中心——最黑暗的重庆。不仅中国社会又临到阶段不同的蜕变时期，而且在我的眼前看见了不少的大大小小的时代悲剧。无数的爱国青年、革命同志失踪了，关进了集中营。代表人民力量的中国共产党在陕北遭受着封锁，而在江南抵抗日本帝国主义的侵略最有功劳的中共所领导的八路军之外的另一支兄弟部队——新四军，遭了反动派的围剿而受到很大的损失。全中国进步的人们都感受着愤怒，因而我便把这时代的愤怒复活在屈原时代里去了。换句话说，我是借了屈原的时代来象征我们当前的时代。
    我的这样写法在当时是收到了效果的。剧本的发表和演出，从进步方面都受到了前所未有的热烈的欢迎，而从反动方面也都受到了前所未有的猛烈的弹压。然而中国的时代进展得很快，仅仅八九年的期间中国已经成为了人民的中国，因而这样的剧本便很快地失掉了它的时代的意义。这样的剧本，在今天看起来，就仿佛是莎士比亚时代的作品了。
    这个剧本在今天被介绍到苏联，在我自然是很光荣的事。译者费德林博士是屈原研究的专家，当这个剧本的写作和演出时，他也正在重庆；我是怎样为这个剧本的，这个剧本演出时的一般反映情况是怎样，费德林博士知道得最清楚。因此，费德林博士可以说是再适当也没有的译者了。
    但我很耽心，这个剧本不一定能够受到苏联读者的欢迎。原因是如上所述，它所表现的是两千年前的中国的故事，而又很快地失掉了象征现时代的那一段意义。在这之外，更加以我没有莎士比亚那样的才华。假使我这耽心成为事实，自然是该我负责。费德林博士是尽了他的最善的努力的，我谨向他致谢。
    一九五○年十月二十二日于北京
    这篇序文是一年半前写的了，史剧“屈原”的俄文译本已于去年十月出版。今年三月，在莫斯科遇见费德林博士，他告诉我，莫斯科戏剧界正在酝酿着这个剧本的演出，法捷耶夫也表示支持。法捷耶夫也曾当面告诉我，他很欣赏这个剧本，人物塑造很鲜明，我的“耽心”是过虑。我很感谢苏联朋友们十分重视我们杰出的历史人物。
    一九五二年五月二十六日
