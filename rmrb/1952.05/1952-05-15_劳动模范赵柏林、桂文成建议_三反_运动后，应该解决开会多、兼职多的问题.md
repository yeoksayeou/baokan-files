    Labor Models Zhao Bolin and Gui Wencheng Suggest:
   After the "Three-Anti" Campaign, the Problems of Too Many Meetings and Too Many Concurrent Jobs Should Be Resolved
    Editor: I am a labor model from the Nanchong Silk Textile Factory No. 2 in the North Sichuan District. I hold too many positions concurrently, and I attend too many meetings. Therefore, I do not have time to study culture and technology. I once attended seven meetings in one evening; normally, I have to attend three or four meetings every day. I hold eight positions concurrently. I once signed up for a spare-time school, but because I didn't have time, I only attended three classes in one semester, and the rest of my spare time was spent attending meetings. This situation hinders my studies and prevents me from improving my cultural level. I hope that relevant departments will solve this problem after the "Three-Anti" campaign.

    Editor: I am a labor model from the Huaxin Textile Mill in Pingyuan Province. I think the main reason why we can't study properly is because of too many concurrent jobs. With too many concurrent jobs, there are also too many meetings. I hold ten positions concurrently, and I have to attend fourteen regular meetings every month, not including temporary meetings. I calculated that in one year, the time spent in meetings accounts for seven months. In this way, I don't have time to study properly. I hope that after the "Three-Anti" campaign, all factories will solve this problem.

    劳动模范赵柏林、桂文成建议
   “三反”运动后，应该解决开会多、兼职多的问题
    编辑同志：我是川北区南充丝纺二厂的劳动模范。我兼任的职务太多，参加的会议也多，因此，我没有时间学习文化和技术。我曾经在一个晚上，参加了七个会议；平常，每天我要参加三四个会议。我一个人，兼了八个职务。我曾报名参加业余学校，但因为没有时间，在一个学期内只上了三堂课，其余的业余时间都去开会了。这种情况，妨碍了我的学习，使我的文化水平不能提高。我希望有关方面在“三反”运动后解决这个问题。

    编辑同志：我是平原省华新纱厂的劳动模范。我觉得我们不能好好地学习的原因，主要是兼职多。兼职多了，会议也就多了。我一个人兼了十个职务，每月要参加十四个例会，临时的会议还不在内。我统计了一下，在一年内，开会的时间就占了七个月。这样，我就没有时间来好好学习。我希望在“三反”运动后，各工厂都解决这个问题。
