Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The seventh detachment of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team returned to Beijing on the 22nd. Those who welcomed them at the station included Li Dequan of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Peng Zemin and Wu Maosun of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, Chen Qiyuan of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, Bao Jinghuan of the Ministry of Health, and representatives from units such as the Chinese People's Relief Administration, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, numbering dozens of people. Choi Young, the Counselor of the Korean Embassy, was also present to welcome them at the station.

The detachment, totaling 148 people, served the Korean People's Army, the Korean people, and the Chinese People's Volunteers day and night under the leadership of Detachment Leader Wang Changlai and Deputy Detachment Leader Wang Qingchun. They displayed a high degree of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism, and achieved brilliant successes in their work.

In the hospitals, the team members not only meticulously treated the wounded but also used their ingenuity and worked diligently to overcome various material difficulties. On their first day in Korea, they manufactured application instruments and carried out the expansion of the hospital's construction work. Later, without affecting medical work, they gradually made mobile operating tables, footstools, washstands, medicine delivery boxes, instrument tables, examination beds, and fixed splints, thereby enabling the work to proceed smoothly. They also managed to have one surgical team perform six major operations in a day, expanding one operating room into six operating rooms. At the same time, they built underground sickrooms, living quarters, bathhouses, and air-raid shelter-style operating rooms and treatment rooms, overcoming the barbarity of the American aggressors' indiscriminate bombing and ensuring the safety of the wounded and sick. When the severe cold arrived, most of the team members went up the mountains to chop firewood to save public fuel, keeping the wards and operating rooms warm. The female comrades insisted on washing dressings in the river in the cold climate of minus fifteen degrees Celsius to reduce the consumption of dressings. When the wounded needed blood transfusions, all the team members rushed to give their blood to the wounded. Nurse Gao Jingxia donated 450 cc of blood and saved the life of Korean People's Army female soldier Li Jishu. They faithfully carried out the oath they had made in their motherland: "Everything for the wounded."

In their spare time, the team members also helped Korean nurses learn techniques, enabling them to participate in surgical work within three months. They also helped the Korean people treat diseases, carry out spring plowing, and transport fertilizer. In the two months before returning home, they also focused on environmental sanitation and preventive injections to eradicate bacteria. The entire team received a very warm send-off when they returned home. The Korean people and the People's Army gave them the title of "Most Noble Saviors of Life."

    我红十字会国际医防服务队第七大队已从朝鲜回到北京
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国红十字会国际医防服务队第七大队已在二十二日回到北京。到车站欢迎的有中国红十字会总会李德全、中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会彭泽民、吴茂荪、中央人民政府内务部陈其瑗、卫生部鲍敬桓和中国人民救济总会、北京市卫生局、中华医学会、中国红十字会北京市分会等单位代表数十人。到车站欢迎的还有朝鲜大使馆参赞崔英。
    该大队共一百四十八人，到朝鲜后，在大队长王昌来、副大队长王庆春领导下，不分昼夜，不辞劳苦地为朝鲜人民军、朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军服务，发挥了高度的国际主义和革命人道主义精神，在工作上获得了光辉的成就。
    该队队员在医院中除悉心为伤员治疗外，并且开动脑筋亲自动手克服了各种物质条件的困难。他们到朝鲜的第一天，就制造了应用器具，进行扩展医院的修建工作；以后又在不影响医疗工作的情况下，逐渐做出了活动手术台、足凳、洗手架、送药提盒、器械台、诊病床、固定用夹板等，因而使工作得到顺利开展。他们并争取到一个手术组在一天内做六个大手术，把一个手术室扩展成为六个手术室；同时还修建了地下病室、住室、洗澡场、防空洞式的手术室和治疗室等，战胜了美国侵略者滥施轰炸的兽行，保障了伤病人员的安全。严寒来到时，队员们大部分都上山砍柴，以节省公家的燃料，使病房和手术室保持温暖；女同志在零下十五度的寒冷气候里，坚持到河里去洗敷料，以减少敷料的消耗。当伤员需要输血时，全体队员都争先恐后地把自己的血输给伤员，女护士郜静霞输血四百五十西西挽救了朝鲜人民军女战士李吉洙的生命。他们忠实地执行着在祖国所提出的“一切为伤员”的誓言。
    队员们在业余时间还帮助朝鲜护士们学习技术，使他们在三个月内能参加手术工作，并帮助了朝鲜人民治疗疾病、春耕、运肥。临返国前两个月，他们还重点地做了扑灭细菌的环境卫生及防疫注射等工作。全体队员回国时，曾受到非常热烈的欢送。朝鲜人民和人民军赠给他们以“最高贵的生命之恩人”的称号。
