    Strengthening Friendly Cooperation Between Czechoslovakia and China
    柯别茨基 (Ke Biezki)
    Minister of Information and Culture of the Czechoslovak Republic
    Head of the Czechoslovak Government Delegation

    Editor's Note: The Czechoslovak Government Delegation, which arrived in China on April 12th, returned to their country on May 10th after gloriously completing their mission. Before leaving Beijing, 柯别茨基 (Ke Biezki), the head of the delegation and Minister of Information and Culture of the Czechoslovak Republic, wrote an article for this newspaper to bid farewell to the Chinese people. The full text is as follows:

    On May 6, 1952, the Czechoslovak Government Delegation, representing the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, signed four important agreements related to the development of cultural and scientific-technological cooperation between the two countries. The conclusion of these agreements will strengthen the foundation for the development of friendly cooperation and mutual assistance in various fields between the two countries, which will first be reflected in cultural and economic life. These agreements were signed on the basis of the feelings of sympathy and sincere friendship that have existed between our two peoples for many years. These agreements will not only strengthen the friendship between the two peoples, but will also consolidate the economic ties between the two countries and accelerate the development of productive forces in both countries. Therefore, our agreements for mutual assistance are a major contribution to strengthening the power of the peace camp headed by the great and invincible Soviet Union—our common friend and ally—consolidating world lasting peace, and opposing the war plans and provocations of the United States and other imperialist countries.

    Thanks to the warm hospitality of the Central People's Government, the delegation was able to have a valuable opportunity to see many parts of this huge, beautiful, and rich country and to get to know the great people of this country during its one-month stay in China. In addition to visiting the capital and its suburbs, the delegation also visited Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, traversing a large part of China's land. The delegation visited many factories, schools, universities, museums, and saw many theatrical performances, exhibitions, and cultural activities. The delegation had the opportunity to learn in detail about the new People's China and the various issues of concern to the 475 million people, whether in large-scale gatherings, in small-scale discussions with workers, peasants, and students, or in conversations with heads of various agencies and the highest representatives of the state.

    Of course, a one-month stay is not enough to understand all aspects of a country like China. However, the delegation solved this problem relatively satisfactorily. This is because the Czechoslovak delegation came to the Chinese people filled with deep and sincere enthusiasm, admiration, and fraternal love, these sentiments being the expression of every Czech and Slovak towards the Chinese people for many years; at the same time, it was because the Czechoslovak delegation came from a country aided by the great Soviet Union and under the wise leadership of our beloved President Gottwald to distant China under the leadership of Mao Zedong—two countries that are also taking the path of people's democracy towards socialism, people's peace, and a happy life.

    Due to the above two main reasons, and even more because of the kind, sincere, and straightforward attitude of the Chinese friends with whom the delegation interacted, the delegation was able to obtain rich knowledge about the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and the people's work and life when it returned home.

    Our delegation greatly admired the ancient Chinese culture with its thousands of years of history, which is not only manifested in the precious cultural and historical relics, but also in the current life of the working people of China after liberation, in the new literature and art, in the dramatic and film arts, in the beautiful music and folk dances, and in the new way of life, expressed in the aspects of dealing with people, dressing, and cooking.

    The Czechoslovak Government Delegation highly praises the character of the people of New China—noble and modest, enthusiastic, brave, and full of ardent patriotism and working enthusiasm. With the people possessing such qualities, educated and organized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been tested by long revolutionary struggles, and its beloved Chairman Mao Zedong, there are no difficulties that cannot be solved in a short period of time.

    The Czechoslovak Government Delegation has personally witnessed that although the Chinese people have suffered from the aggression and interference of US imperialism and various hostile attitudes, they have made great achievements in industry, agriculture, and transportation in the short three years since liberation. New China, filled with inexhaustible revolutionary enthusiasm, quickly eliminated the influence of imperialism and the remnants of feudal forces, and restored the destruction caused by the Kuomintang bandits. The liberated Chinese people have become the masters of their land, and they are exerting the unparalleled power of their endless treasures. Under the wise economic policy leadership of the People's Democratic Government, China has not only eliminated years of famine, but has also been able to export important surplus food and agricultural products abroad. China's abundant supply of coal and other precious metal minerals, as well as the construction of socialist industrialization that has begun, clearly indicate that not only the Chinese people, but all peoples who are willing to maintain sincere, friendly, and mutually respectful economic relations with China, will see their economies develop rapidly.

    The Czechoslovak Government Delegation is deeply grateful to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China for enabling the delegation to get close to the fraternal Chinese people and to understand the achievements of the Chinese people in building their beautiful and rich land and in striving for world peace.

    After returning home, the delegation will report to the people and government leaders of the whole country on the great achievements of New China and their bright prospects for continuing to accelerate construction.

    The working people of Czechoslovakia have expressed sympathy with the Chinese people since their heroic revolutionary struggle in 1925 until they victoriously completed their revolutionary struggle on October 1, 1949. Undoubtedly, the Czechoslovak people will welcome with unparalleled enthusiasm the living conditions, achievements in all aspects, and future plans of the victorious Chinese people. Although Czechoslovakia is small in area, with a high degree of industrial and technological development, the Czechoslovak working class will enthusiastically fulfill their responsibilities gloriously in Czech-Chinese cooperation, so as to strengthen common friendship and the cause of peace.

    The 475 million people of China under the leadership of Mao Zedong occupy an important position in the struggle for world peace and against the instigation of new wars by imperialism. The Czechoslovak people feel incomparable admiration and love for the Chinese people, and therefore will guarantee the realization of the agreements signed between the governments of Czechoslovakia and China.

    加强捷中两国间的友好合作
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国宣传与文化部部长
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团长  柯别茨基
    编者按：四月十二日到达中国的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团，在光荣地完成他们的任务后，已于五月十日离京返国。代表团团长、捷克斯洛伐克共和国宣传与文化部部长柯别茨基在离京时，为本报著文，向中国人民告别，全文如下：
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团于一九五二年五月六日代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和中华人民共和国中央人民政府签订了四项有关发展两国间文化与科学技术合作的重要协定。这些协定的缔结，将会加强两国之间发展友好合作和各方面互助的基础，这首先将要体现在文化和经济生活方面。这些协定是在我们两国人民多少年来同情和真诚友谊的情感基础上签订的。这些协定不仅将加强两国人民之间的友谊，而且也将巩固两国之间的经济联系，加速两国生产力的发展。因此，我们彼此互助的协定是对于加强以伟大而不可战胜的苏联——我们共同的朋友和同盟——为首的和平阵营的力量，巩固世界持久和平，和反对美国和其他各国帝国主义战争计划与挑拨的一个重大的贡献。
    感谢中央人民政府亲切的招待，使代表团在中国勾留一个月的期间内，能有宝贵的机会看到这一个巨大、美丽而富足国家的许多地方，并认识了这个国家中的伟大人民。代表团除了参观首都和京郊外，又访问了上海、杭州、广州和武汉，穿越过中国大部的土地。代表团参观了许多工厂、学校、大学、博物馆并看到了许多戏剧的表演、展览会和文化活动。代表团不论在大规模的集会中，在和工人、农民、学生的小型座谈会中，在和各机关首长和国家的最高代表交谈中，都能有机会详细了解新的人民中国和四亿七千五百万人民所关心的各方面问题。
    当然，以一个月的勾留期间来了解像中国这样一个国家的各方面问题是不够的。但是，代表团较为圆满的解决了这一个问题。这是因为捷克斯洛伐克代表团是充满着深厚而真诚的热诚和敬仰与兄弟的友爱，来到中国人民的面前，这些情感是每一个捷克人和斯洛伐克人多年来对中国人民的表示；同时，还因为捷克斯洛伐克代表团是由伟大苏联援助下和敬爱的哥特瓦尔德总统英明领导之下的国家来到了遥远的毛泽东领导下的中国——这两个国家同是由一条人民民主的道路走向社会主义、人民和平与幸福的生活的大道。
    由于上述的两个主要原因，而且更因为代表团所交往的中国朋友们的亲切、真诚和爽直的态度，才使代表团在返国的时候能得到有关中华人民共和国、中国人民、人民工作和生活等各方面的丰富知识。
    我们代表团非常仰慕数千年历史的中国古老文化，它不仅表现在文化和历史的宝贵遗物中，而且更可在解放后的中国劳动人民的目前生活中、新文艺中、戏剧和电影艺术中、优美的音乐和民间舞蹈中、以及新的生活方式中，由待人接物、穿衣、烹调等方面表现出来。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团极为赞美新中国人民的性格——高尚而谦让、热心、英勇和热烈的爱国主义和工作热情。人民具有这样的品质，在经过长期革命斗争考验的中国共产党和它的敬爱的毛泽东主席领导之下，受到教育并组织起来，就没有在短期内不能解决的困难。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团亲眼看到中国人民虽然遭受到美帝国主义的侵略干涉和各种敌对的态度，却在解放后短短三年之内，在工业、农业和交通等各方面做出了伟大成就。充满着永不息灭的革命热情的新中国，很快地消灭了帝国主义的影响和封建残余势力，并恢复了国民党匪帮的破坏。解放后的中国人民，变成了他们土地的统治者，他们正在发挥他们无尽宝藏的无比威力。在人民民主政府英明的经济政策领导之下，不但中国扫除了多年的饥馑，而且能够向国外输出重要的剩余食物和农产品。中国大量煤和其他贵重金属矿物的供应，以及开始社会主义工业化的建设，都清楚地指出不仅是中国人民，而且凡是愿意和中国保持诚恳、友好和互相尊重经济关系的人民，他们的经济都将走向迅速的发展。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团深深感谢中华人民共和国中央人民政府能使代表团和兄弟般的中国人民接近，并了解中国人民在他们美丽和富足的土地上建设的成就和争取世界和平的事业。
    代表团在回国之后，将向全国人民和政府首长报告新中国的伟大成绩和他们继续加速建设的光明远景。
    捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民自中国人民一九二五年的英勇革命斗争起，一直到他们在一九四九年十月一日胜利地完成了革命斗争止，都是和中国人民表示同情的。无疑的，捷克斯洛伐克人民将以无比的热情欢迎胜利的中国人民的生活情形、各方面的成就和将来的计划。捷克斯洛伐克面积虽小，而工业和技术有着高度的发展，捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级将热情地在捷中合作方面光荣地完成他们责任，以加强共同友谊与和平事业。
    毛泽东领导下的中国四亿七千五百万人民在争取世界和平和反对帝国主义新战争挑拨的斗争中占着重要地位。捷克斯洛伐克人民对于中国人民感到无比的敬仰和友爱，因而将保证实现捷中两国政府之间所签订的协定。
