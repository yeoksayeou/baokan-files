Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: Farmers in North China are actively preparing to welcome a bumper wheat harvest with immense joy.

    This year, wheat growth in the North China region is excellent, unprecedented in recent years. In Pingyuan Province, a major wheat-producing area in North China, the estimated average yield per mu is over 96 jin, an increase of about 25% compared to last year; some high-yield areas may yield over 1000 jin per mu. Hebei Province's wheat output is expected to exceed the planned figure of 81 jin per mu. Although Chahar and Suiyuan experienced drought last winter and severe cold this spring, the spring wheat output is still estimated to exceed last year's.

    Since the beginning of spring, farmers in various provinces have focused on field management and pest control to protect seedlings. In Hebei Province, wheat fields were universally hoed once, and irrigated fields were hoed three to five times. In Shanxi, many wheat fields were top-dressed with fertilizer. In early April, wheat aphids, red spiders, wheat sawflies, and other pests successively occurred in wheat fields in various places. Shanxi mobilized nearly two million farmers to use scientific pesticides and tools, as well as folk methods created by the masses, to eliminate them, and finally overcame the pests. In Xinxiang Prefecture of Pingyuan Province alone, 220,000 jin of wheat aphids and other pests were eliminated. In addition, the timely and even rainfall in North China this spring has ensured a general increase in the unit area yield of wheat fields.

    Currently, Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan are preparing to launch a bumper wheat harvest appraisal campaign. When the wheat bumper harvest visiting group organized by Xinxiang Prefecture of Pingyuan went to Wuzhi to visit Li Entong's wheat, red flags were also erected everywhere in the wheat fields of Yaosun Village, marking their targets for bumper harvest. Farmer Zhao Baoquan planted a red flag in his high-yield field, which he plans to harvest 800 jin of superior wheat per mu, and sent someone to request the visiting group to come and visit, stating: "Welcome to visit, welcome to appraise." Various places have specifically arranged wheat harvesting and seed selection work. Some villages and mutual aid teams have already made wheat harvesting plans and wheat protection agreements. Pingyuan plans to complete the preliminary selection of improved wheat varieties throughout the province this year, and Hebei plans to use improved varieties in 50% of wheat fields during this autumn sowing.

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have prepared a large number of summer harvest agricultural implements, summer field seeds, and fertilizers to supply farmers.

    华北农民积极准备迎接小麦丰收
    主要产麦区已具体布置麦收和选种工作
    【新华社二十七日讯】华北农民正以无比的喜悦心情，积极准备迎接小麦丰收。
    今年华北区小麦成长良好，为数年来所未有。华北主要产麦区之平原省，估计每亩平均可产九十六斤以上，比去年约可增产二成半；丰产地有的每亩可收到千斤以上。河北省小麦产量可超过每亩八十
    一斤的计划数字。察哈尔、绥远虽因去冬气候干旱，今春又遇严寒，但春麦产量，估计仍将超过去年。
    入春以来，各省农民注意了麦田加工和除虫保苗斗争。河北省麦田做到普锄一遍，水地锄到三遍到五遍，山西不少麦田都施了追肥。四月初各地麦田曾相继发生麦蚜、红蜘蛛、麦叶蜂等虫害，山西动员了近二百万农民运用科学药械和群众创造的土办法来扑灭，终于战胜了虫害。平原省仅新乡专区即打麦蚜等害虫二十二万斤。加以今春华北各地雨水调匀，就保证了麦田单位面积产量的普遍提高。
    现在，河北、山西、平原已在准备开展小麦丰产评比运动。平原新乡专区组织的小麦丰产参观团到武陟参观李恩同的小麦时，窑孙庄麦田中也到处插了红旗，标志着他们争取丰产的数字。农民赵保全将红旗插在每亩计划收八百斤优种小麦的丰产地内，派专人来请求参观团前往，提出：“欢迎参观，欢迎评比。”各地都已具体布置了麦收、选种工作，有的村庄和互助组已订了收麦计划和护麦公约。平原计划今年在全省范围内完成小麦良种初选，河北计划今年秋种小麦，要使百分之五十的麦田使用良种。
    各地供销合作社现已准备了大批夏收农具、夏田种籽和肥料供应农民。
