Xinhua News Agency, May 29th:

The Czechoslovakian Trade Union Delegation, invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of their departure from China:

The Czechoslovakian Trade Union Delegation was very pleased to receive the invitation from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to come to Beijing to participate in the 1952 "May Day" celebrations. We are most grateful to the Chinese trade unions and workers for this opportunity to learn about the lives and work of Chinese workers and peasants.

Although our newspapers also provide detailed reports on China, and although we all paid close attention to the excellent New China Exhibition held in Prague last year, the tremendous achievements we have seen in some Chinese provinces have exceeded our expectations. After visiting the huge Huai River project and many factories and villages, we are even more convinced that the Chinese people, led by the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, will not only be able to defeat foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries but will also be able to build a new China in a short period of time. The delegation was very pleased to see the great enthusiasm shown by Chinese youth. Chinese youth are the best guarantee for building a new and happy life for all the Chinese people. In all circumstances, the Chinese people have shown the most sincere gratitude and friendship towards the Soviet people. This fact shows that this friendship and cooperation can never be destroyed.

The Czechoslovakian Trade Union Delegation once again expresses its gratitude to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and assures that after returning home, we will use the experience and impressions gained in China to encourage Czechoslovakian workers to achieve greater victories on the road to socialism and to provide greater assistance to the Chinese people in building their industry.

The stronger China is, the stronger the peace and democracy camp will be, because China, in friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, is Asia's most powerful bastion of peace and an example for colonial and semi-colonial countries to strive for true independence and freedom. We wish Chinese workers good health and more achievements.

    捷工会代表团离开我国前夕发表谈话
    【新华社二十九日讯】应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的捷克斯洛伐克工会代表团，在离开中国前夕，发表书面谈话如下：
    捷克斯洛伐克工会代表团在接到中华全国总工会邀请来北京参加一九五二年“五一”节庆祝典礼的请柬时，便感到非常高兴；我们能借此机会了解中国工人和农民的生活与工作情况，首先得向中国的工会和劳动者表示最大的感谢。
    虽然我国的报纸也在详细地介绍着中国的情况，虽然去年我们全都非常注意地参观了在布拉格举办的出色的新中国展览会，但我们在中国一些省份里所看到的巨大成就，却超出了我们的意料。在参观了淮河的巨大工程，访问了许多工厂和乡村以后，我们更加确信：以工人阶级为首的中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，不仅能够战胜了外国帝国主义和国内反动派，而且将来也能够在短期内建设好新中国。代表团看到中国青年所表现的极大积极性，感觉非常高兴。中国青年是为全体中国人民建设新的幸福生活的最好保证。在任何场合，中国人民对苏联人民都表现出最真挚的感谢与友谊。这个事实说明：这种友谊和合作是永远破坏不了的。
    捷克斯洛伐克工会代表团再一次向中华全国总工会表示感谢，并保证：我们在返国后，将把在中国所得到的经验和印象用来鼓舞捷克斯洛伐克的劳动者，使他们在走向社会主义的道路上获得更大的胜利，并对中国人民在建设自己的工业方面给予更大的帮助。
    中国越强大，和平民主阵营也就越强大，因为中国在与苏联友好合作下，是亚洲最强有力的和平堡垒和殖民地与半殖民地国家争取真正独立和自由的榜样。祝中国劳动者身体健康并获得更多的成就。
