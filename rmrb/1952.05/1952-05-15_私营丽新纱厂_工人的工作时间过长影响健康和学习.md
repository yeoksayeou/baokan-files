    Private Lixin Yarn Factory
    Excessive Working Hours Affect Workers' Health and Learning

    To the Editor: I am a fine yarn worker at the private Lixin Yarn Factory in Wuxi City. I want to tell you about an unreasonable situation: the working hours of the workers in our factory are too long. We work at least twelve hours a day, and sometimes we have meetings, which can take up to fifteen hours. Due to the excessive working hours, our workers, especially the female workers, are in very poor health, and the number of sick workers is constantly increasing. The workers on the night shift are even more ill, which greatly affects production. The workers say, "We are very tired and have no time to study. This cannot go on." I hope the relevant authorities will quickly resolve this issue.

    私营丽新纱厂
    工人的工作时间过长影响健康和学习
    编辑同志：我是无锡市私营丽新纱厂的细纱工人。我要告诉你们一件不合理的事情：我们厂内工人的工作时间过长。我们每日至少工作十二小时，有时还要开会，几乎要到十五小时。由于工作时间过长，我们工人，尤其是女工的身体都很坏，生病的工人不断增加，做夜班的工人病得更多，大大影响了生产。工人说：“我们累得很，又没时间学习，这样下去，是不行的。”我希望有关方面迅速解决这个问题。    工业劳动模范    李霞影
