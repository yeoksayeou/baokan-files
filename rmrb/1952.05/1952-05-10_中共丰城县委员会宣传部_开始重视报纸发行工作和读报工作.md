Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    CCP Fengcheng County Committee Propaganda Department
    Begins to Value Newspaper Distribution and Reading

    Editor: The People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on March 22 published a letter from Comrade Jiang Rensheng, criticizing the phenomenon that some townships in the thirteenth district of our county do not subscribe to newspapers. This criticism is correct. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to newspaper distribution work, and the specific leadership was very poor. Therefore, in the rural newspaper distribution work, there was a phenomenon of drifting and imbalance. Although the total number of newspaper subscriptions in rural areas throughout the county has reached more than 2,000 copies, a small number of townships have not subscribed to newspapers. We plan to conduct an inspection of newspaper distribution throughout the county recently. In these two months, we will vigorously promote the benefits of reading newspapers so that each administrative village subscribes to at least one copy of the "Nanchang Peasant" newspaper. We have also decided to conscientiously organize newspaper reading.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共丰城县委员会宣传部
    开始重视报纸发行工作和读报工作
    编辑同志：三月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了江仁生同志的来信，批评我县十三区有些乡不订阅报纸的现象。这一批评是正确的。我们过去对报纸的发行工作不够重视，具体领导很差，因此，在农村的报纸发行工作中就产生了自流和不平衡的现象。全县农村订报总数虽已达两千多份，但有少数乡却没有订阅报纸。我们准备在最近把全县的报纸发行工作作一次检查。在这两月内，我们要大力宣传读报的好处，使每个行政村至少订一份“南昌农民”报。我们并决定要认真组织读报工作。    中共丰城县委员会宣传部
