    Letters from Readers
    Supporting the Rational Use of Specialized Talent
    Editor's Note: On May 19th, this newspaper published the opinions of comrades Dong Zhenyu et al. on the use of cadres in various departments, and also published this newspaper's brief commentary on this issue. Readers from various regions have written in, expressing their support for these opinions and exposing some of the unreasonable phenomena they know about in the use of cadres. Now, we are selecting and publishing five letters as follows:
    Suggestion to Return Industrial Technical Cadres to Their Posts
    Editor: I am a cadre who has studied mechanical engineering and has many years of experience in mechanical manufacturing. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the anti-Japanese base areas, I learned many ways to overcome difficulties and find substitutes. During the War of Liberation, due to the needs of the revolution, I was transferred away from my original mechanical manufacturing position, and it has been four years now. I would very much like to return to the work position that I am familiar with. As the country is adjusting its institutions, I hope the People's Government will launch a movement to return industrial technical cadres to their posts. At the same time, the personnel departments should guarantee to the departments from which cadres have been drawn that, if necessary, appropriate supplements will be provided.    Yu Fangwu
    Students Who Have Already Graduated from University Should Not Be Transferred to University for Further Study
    Editor: After reading the opinions on the use of cadres put forward by comrades Dong Zhenyu et al. in the People's Daily of May 19th, we were reminded of some situations here.
    We are a group of young cadres who were transferred from the army to study at the university. Our coming to school to study is in line with the policy of the Central People's Government to train construction cadres. However, among these comrades, some have already graduated from the mechanical engineering department of the university, some have already graduated from the agricultural chemistry department of the university and have worked in the agricultural sector, some have a certain level of literary proficiency and have published works, some have graduated from journalism schools, some have studied at Russian language schools and have a level of Russian that surpasses that of general university Russian department graduates, some were assigned jobs by the Central Ministry of Education after graduating from university in 1950, and several have graduated or attended university, and are young people with a certain degree of professional work ability and work history. We believe that assigning these people to appropriate work positions immediately would allow them to play a role in the construction of the motherland, and there is no need to repeat their studies. We hope that the relevant departments will quickly consider and handle this matter.
    Lin Zhi et al.
    Hope the Cadre School of the Central Ministry of Communications Will Use Cadres Rationally
    Editor: I think the opinions put forward by comrades Dong Zhenyu et al. in the People's Daily of May 19th regarding the use of cadres in various units are indeed worthy of universal attention by all agencies. The Cadre School of the Central Ministry of Communications has a serious phenomenon of wasting talent and burying talent. For example, Yu Changqi, a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Wuhan Transportation College, is a materials technician, but he was assigned to the cadre school as a class teacher, managing the daily life and study of students. A comrade surnamed Ji, after graduating from a university statistics class, was assigned to engage in education work in the cadre school. Another classmate surnamed Zhou, who also studied engineering, is engaged in class affairs work. There are also students who are good at accounting but are assigned to do receiving and dispatching registration work. There are many similar situations. Recently, the school is rectifying its organizational structure, and it is hoped that the school leaders will pay attention to the above situation.  Xu Ximing
    Northeast People's Government Personnel Department
    The Phenomenon of Having Engineering Personnel Do Personnel Work Should Be Corrected
    Editor: The People's Daily of May 19th published the opinions of comrades Dong Zhenyu et al. on the use of cadres and the "brief commentary" on this issue, which I think is completely correct and necessary.
    Last autumn, more than 300 graduates from universities in the Southwest Region were uniformly assigned to work in the Northeast by the Personnel Department of the Central People's Government. The vast majority of students were assigned to relevant work positions by the Personnel Department of the Northeast People's Government in accordance with the principle of "integration of learning and application." However, some students were retained in the Northeast People's Government Personnel Department to do personnel work due to "work needs." These students are mostly majoring in mechanics, chemistry, chemical engineering, and physics. I think the work of these students needs to be adjusted.
    At present, the economic construction of the Northeast is developing rapidly, and the number of specialized technical talents is far from meeting the needs of the development of the situation. I suggest that the Personnel Department of the Northeast People's Government check the situation of personnel distribution in the Northeast Region over the years, especially the distribution of technical talents, so as to "make the best use of people's talents" and enable cadres to exert the greatest strength in revolutionary work.  Lei Guanguang
    Hua East District Native Produce Company Pig Industry Sales Department
    Some Cadres Have the Phenomenon of Not Using What They Have Learned
    Editor: There is a phenomenon of cadres not using what they have learned in the Pig Industry Sales Department of the China Native Produce Company's East China Branch. As far as I know, Comrade Wang Zuoduo of the General Affairs Section of the Secretariat of the department graduated from the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant Technical School and the Mechanical Maintenance Training Class, but he did not do work related to what he had learned, but did some clerical registration work. When he explained to the leadership that he hoped to do technical work, Comrade Zhou Ming, who was in charge of the personnel section, labeled him with hats such as "disobeying the organization," "making trouble with emotions," and "having ideological problems," and only let it go after he made a "self-criticism." Another comrade, Zhu Bingchen, has worked in telecommunications for three years and is now a clerk in the Secretariat of the department. There may be other cases of cadres not using what they have learned. Therefore, I suggest that the department check and adjust.   Wang Shipei
    Suggestions on Recruitment of Workers by Various Factories and Mines
    Editor: Since the land reform, due to the improvement of farmers' political awareness and enthusiasm for production, there has been a surplus of labor in some places. Many rural youths want to work in factories and mines. However, due to the remote location and lack of information, it is difficult to find a job. Four young people in a village west of Fengrun County, Hebei Province, have gone to Tangshan four times to find work, but have not succeeded. However, many factories and mines are feeling that their labor force is insufficient and urgently needs to be supplemented due to the rapid development of economic construction (especially in the Northeast region). Therefore, I suggest that if the factory and mining departments or relevant leading agencies need to supplement the labor force or recruit apprentices in the future, it is best to recruit them in a planned way through the labor departments of various provinces and counties, so as to avoid many people traveling back and forth in vain.  Zhang Baoqi
    Temporary Assignments Should Not Be Made in the Substitute Farming Work
    Editor: There is still a phenomenon of "randomly assigning soldiers" in the substitute farming work in some counties in eastern Sichuan. The families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers often run to the village government to ask for someone to do the work in their fields. The village government takes a perfunctory attitude towards this matter, and temporarily assigns people when needed. Some cadres mistakenly treat the politically significant substitute farming work as a labor reform job, and organize landlords, loafers, etc. into substitute farming teams to do substitute farming for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. For example, the People's Government of a village in Hualong Township, Second District, Guang'an County, let landlords and loafers do substitute farming for Fu Biao, the family member of a soldier. As a result, Fu Biao's corn did not grow at all. The People's Government of Changsha Village, Huilong Township, Second District, Yunyang County, sent landlord Xue Dunming to weed for the family of a revolutionary martyr, and when he arrived in the field, he only pulled up the seedlings but not the weeds. These have seriously affected the production of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. I think that areas where the current substitute farming work is still stuck in "temporary assignments" or has similar situations should be quickly corrected to avoid causing difficulties in the production of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.
    Zhu Yun
    Accounts for Substitute Farming Work Should Be Settled in a Timely Manner in Various Places
    Editor: Timely settlement of work and account is an important link in strengthening and consolidating the substitute farming work, but this work has not been paid attention to in some areas. Some people are unwilling to do more substitute farming for the families of soldiers for this reason, and even some who do a lot of work think they are "out of luck," which affects the substitute farming work. For example, Grandpa Gao of Shangjiawan Village, Sixth District, Pixian County, Shandong Province, did substitute farming for the family of a soldier for five acres of land last year, and the results were very good, but he did not calculate the work and find food. This year, when he was asked to do substitute farming again, he said: "I didn't settle the accounts for the work I did for the family of a soldier last year. Are you still asking me to do substitute farming this year?" Zhang Ruliang, a substitute farming household in Liugangkou Village, Second District, Tancheng County, said when he was asked to do substitute farming again this year because the work account for livestock substitute farming last year had not been settled: "You owe me thirty-seven workdays last year, and you still haven't paid me back. You just said you want to give me an IOU. Can an IOU feed the cattle?" Kaoshan Village, Fourteenth District, Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, Northeast China, was affected by the determination of this year's contracting group because the substitute farming work from last year had not been cleared until April this year. It is understood that there are similar situations in other regions.
    Therefore, I suggest that all localities settle the substitute farming accounts by season in the future to consolidate the enthusiasm of the masses for substitute farming.    Guo Wenkui
    The Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers Should Be Educated to Overcome Their Dependence and Actively Participate in Production
    Editor: Now that the political status of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers has been improved, it has become a social custom to respect and care for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. However, some individual families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in some areas still have ideas of dependence and egalitarianism. For example, He Wangshi, a family member of a soldier in the suburbs of Nanjing, is 48 years old and has two sons aged 22 and 20, with four acres of fields and four and a half acres of reed fields. Her family has labor force, but she still asks the masses to do substitute farming for two and a half acres of land, which the masses are very dissatisfied with. Not long ago, when we went to Chahar Province, Chanan Prefecture, and Tongxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, to check our work, we also found similar situations. For example, Wang Wushi, the family member of a soldier in Dingxinzhuang, Sixth District, Tongxian County, used to get up early every day to collect manure, and the manure basket was always with her; this year, she heard that the government had mobilized the masses to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers solve the fertilizer problem, so she stopped collecting manure. Some families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who can buy fertilizer themselves also stopped buying it. For example, in Wujiazhuang, Tenth District, Xuanhua County, Chanan Prefecture, some families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who were not in difficulty also asked for the distribution of preferential grain when the government distributed it this spring. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments in various localities should not only pay attention to mobilizing the masses to do a good job in preferential treatment, but also conduct regular education on the preferential treatment policies and participation in production for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and call on them to strive for greater glory.  Guanjun
    Lucheng County Nanliu Village Checks Substitute Farming Work
    Editor: The Preferential Treatment Committee of Nanliu Village, Lucheng County, Shanxi Province, conducted an on-site inspection of the substitute farming work in the village during the spring plowing and sowing campaign in order to ensure that the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers also increased production. The inspection results showed that the substitute farming work of the agricultural production cooperative was the best. A piece of land of Wang Panshui, a family member of a soldier, had been collapsing for more than two years and had not been repaired. After being farmed by the agricultural production cooperative, it was repaired in two days. The masses reflected: "The production cooperative is not only a mutual aid model, but also a substitute farming model. The land farmed for the family of soldiers is stronger than any year." However, individual households engaged in individual work were only perfunctory about the substitute farming work, making the "wheat grow like cow hair." After the inspection, the village commended and criticized the outstanding households with good and bad substitute farming work on the blackboard newspaper and radio station, which promoted the substitute farming work of the whole village. Now, agricultural production cooperatives and many mutual aid groups have been involved in the movement to ensure the overall increase in production of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and have listed preferential treatment as the most important item in the patriotic covenant.

专栏：读者来信

　　读者来信
    本报读者纷纷来信
    拥护合理使用专门人才
    编者按：五月十九日本报发表了董振玉等同志对各部门使用干部的意见，同时发表了本报对这一问题的简评。各地读者纷纷来信，表示拥护这些意见，并揭露了他们所知道的一些使用干部不合理的现象。现在选登五封来信如后：
    建议工业技术干部归队
    编辑同志：我是一个学过机械工程并有多年从事机械制造工作经验的干部。我在抗日战争时期，在抗日根据地内，曾经学了不少克服困难、寻找代替品的办法。在解放战争中，由于革命的需要，我被调离原来的机械制造工作岗位，到现在已经四年。我很想仍旧回到原来所熟习的工作岗位上去。当今全国调整机构的时候，我希望人民政府发起一个工业技术干部归队运动。同时，由人事部门向各机关保证，被抽调了干部的部门，如有必要的话，给予适当的补充。    余芳吾
    已经在大学毕业的学生不应再调到大学去学习
    编辑同志：读了五月十九日人民日报所载董振玉等六位同志所提关于使用干部的意见后，我们联想起我们这里的一些情况。
    我们是一批从部队中抽调出来到大学里学习的青年干部。我们到学校来学习，是符合于中央人民政府培养建设干部的政策的。但是，在我们这些同志之中，有的已经在大学机械系毕业，有的已经在大学农业化学系毕业而且在农业部门工作过，有的有一定的文学水平且有创作出版，有的曾经在新闻专科学校毕业，有的曾经在俄文专门学校念过书，俄文程度胜过现在一般大学俄文系毕业生的水平，有的在一九五零年大学毕业后由中央教育部统一分配了工作，还有几位已经在大学毕业或肄业，都是有一定的业务工作能力和工作历史的青年。我们认为把这些人马上调派到适当工作岗位上去，在祖国建设事业上是可以发挥作用的，不必再重复学习。希望有关部门迅速考虑处理。
    林之等
    希望中央交通部干部学校合理使用干部
    编辑同志：人民日报五月十九日发表的董振玉等六位同志对于各单位使用干部方面所提出的意见，我认为确是值得各机关普遍注意的。中央交通部干部学校就有浪费人才和埋没人才的严重现象。例如从武汉交通学院电机系毕业的余昌其，是一个材料技术人员，但他却被分配在干部学校担任班主任，每天管理同学的生活和学习。有一个姓季的同志，在大学统计班毕业后，就被分配在干部学校搞教育工作。又有一个姓周的同学，也是学工的，却在搞班干事工作。还有的同学擅长会计，却被分配搞收发登记工作。类似情况很多。最近该校正在整顿组织机构，希望该校领导方面对上述情况加以注意。  徐夕明
    东北人民政府人事部
    应纠正让工程人员作人事工作的现象
    编辑同志：五月十九日人民日报发表了董振玉等六位同志对使用干部的意见和关于这个问题的“简评”，我认为这是完全正确和必要的。
    去年秋季西南区高等学校毕业生三百多人，由中央人民政府人事部统一分配到东北来工作。绝大部分同学都是根据“学用一致”的原则，由东北人民政府人事部分配到有关工作岗位上去了。但有一些同学却因“工作需要”，被东北人民政府人事部留在本机关里搞人事工作。这些同学大都是学机械、化学、化工、物理的。我认为这些同学的工作是需要调整的。
    目前东北的经济建设正在飞快地发展着，专门技术人才的数量远不能适应形势发展的需要。我建议东北人民政府人事部检查一下历年来东北区人事分配尤其是技术人才分配的情况，务使“人尽其才”，使干部能在革命工作中发挥最大的力量。  雷观光
    华东区土产公司猪业运销部
    某些干部有用非所学现象
    编辑同志：中国土产公司华东区公司猪业运销部干部有用非所学的现象。据我所知，该部秘书科总务股的王祖铎同志，曾在重庆钢铁厂技工学校和机械保养训练班毕业，却没有做和他所学有关的工作，而是做一些事务性的登记工作。当他向领导方面说明自己希望做有关技术的工作时，一位负责兼搞人事科工作的周明同志，就给他加上了“不服从组织”、“闹情绪”、“思想有问题”等帽子，并让他作了“检讨”才算了事。另外一位祝炳臣同志，已做过三年电讯工作，现在该部秘书科担任文书。像这样干部用非所学的情况，也许还有。因此，我建议该部检查调整。   王时霈
    对各厂矿招收工人的建议
    编辑同志：土地改革以后，由于农民政治觉悟和生产积极性的提高，有些地方出现了劳动力剩余的现象。好多农村青年要求去工厂、矿山工作。但往往由于地区偏远，消息不灵，很难找到工作。河北省丰润县城西某村有四个青年，曾先后四次到唐山找工作，都没有成功。而很多工厂、矿山由于经济建设的飞速发展（特别在东北区），已感到劳动力不够，急待补充。所以，我建议各厂矿部门或有关领导机关，今后如需要补充劳动力或招收学徒工，最好通过各省、县的劳动部门，有计划地招收，以免许多人徒劳往返。  张宝琦
    代耕工作中不应临时派工
    编辑同志：川东某些县在代耕工作中，还有“乱点兵”的现象。烈属军属经常跑到村政府要求派人替他们做地里的活。村政府对这件事采取应付态度，临时要人，就临时派差。某些干部错误地把具有政治意义的代耕工作，变成了劳动改造工作的性质，把地主、二流子等组织成代耕队，替烈属军属代耕。如广安县二区化龙乡某村人民政府就让地主、二流子去替军属傅表年代耕。因此，傅表年的玉蜀黍根本就没有生长起来。云阳二区回龙乡长沙村人民政府派地主薛敦明给烈属薅草，他到了地里，光拔秧不拔草。这些都严重地影响了烈属军属的生产。我认为，凡是目前代耕工作仍然停留在“临时派工”或有类似情况的地区，应该迅速加以纠正，以免造成烈属军属生产中的困难。
    朱云
    各地应及时结算代耕工账
    编辑同志：及时结工算账，是加强与巩固代耕工作的重要环节，但在某些地区，却没有注意这个工作。有些群众就因为这个缘故，不愿给军属多代耕，甚至个别出工多的便认为自己“倒了霉”，结果影响了代耕工作。如山东省邳县六区尚家湾村高大爷，去年给军属代耕五亩地，成绩很好，但没有计工找粮。今年仍要他代耕时，他说：“我去年给军属多出的工没有算账，今年还找我代耕吗？”郯城县二区刘港口村代耕户张如良因去年牲口代耕的工账没有结清，今年再找他代耕时，他就说：“去年欠我三十七个工，现在还不找给我，光说要打条子给我，条子能喂牛吗？”东北松江省双城县十四区靠山村，由于去年的代耕工到今年四月还没有清账，影响到今年包耕组的确定。据了解，其它地区也有类似情况。
    因此，我建议各地今后按季节结算代耕账，以巩固群众的代耕热情。    郭文魁
    应教育烈属军属克服依赖思想积极参加生产
    编辑同志：现在烈属军属的政治地位提高了，尊敬和爱护烈属军属已成为一种社会风气。但某些地区的个别烈属军属，却还有依赖思想和平均主义思想。如南京市郊区军属何王氏，本人四十八岁，还有二十二岁及二十岁的两个儿子，有四亩田和四亩半芦苇地。她家有劳动力，还要群众代耕二亩半田，群众甚为不满。不久以前，我们到察哈尔省察南专区和河北省通县专区等地检查工作时，也曾发现类似情况。如通县六区定辛庄军属王武氏，过去每天起早拾粪，粪筐常不离身；今年听说政府发动群众帮助烈属军属解决肥料问题，她便不再拾粪了。有些自己能买肥料的烈属军属也不买了。又如察南专区宣化县十区武家庄，在今春政府发放优待粮时，有些家庭并不困难的烈属军属也要求发给。因此，我建议各地有关部门除注意动员群众作好优抚工作外，还应该对烈属军属经常地进行关于优抚政策和参加生产的教育，号召他们争取更大光荣。  冠军
    潞城县南流村检查代耕工作
    编辑同志：山西省潞城南流村优抚委员会，在春耕播种运动中，为了保证烈属军属的地也同样增产，对村中代耕工作作了一次实地检查。检查结果，知道农业生产合作社的代耕工作做得最好。军属王盘水的一块地，地边塌了二年多也没有修好，归农业生产合作社代耕后，两天就给弄好了。群众反映：“生产合作社不光是互助模范，还是代耕模范，给军属代耕的地比那年都强。”可是个别单干户对代耕工作只是潦草从事，弄得“麦子长得像牛毛”。该村在检查后，对代耕工作作得好的和坏的突出户，在黑板报上和广播台上分别进行了表扬和批评，因而推动了全村的代耕工作。现在，农业生产合作社和许多互助组都卷入了保证烈属军属全面增产的运动中，都把优抚工作列为爱国公约中最重要的一条。
