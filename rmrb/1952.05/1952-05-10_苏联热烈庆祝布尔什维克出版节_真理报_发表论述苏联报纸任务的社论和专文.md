Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th (TASS): Today, the entire Soviet Union is celebrating the Bolshevik Publishing Festival. Forty years ago, on May 5, 1912, following Lenin's instructions and under Stalin's initiative, the Bolshevik mass newspaper "Pravda" was founded. Every year on May 5th, the Soviet Union holds a review of newspapers. Bolshevik Press Day has become a traditional festival for the Soviet people. Today's "Pravda" editorial emphasizes that Soviet newspapers are a new type of newspaper, faithfully serving the interests of the people building communism. It disseminates the lofty Bolshevik truth and the invincible Leninist ideology to the masses.

"Pravda" points out that there are now over 8,000 newspapers published throughout the Soviet Union in the languages of the various Soviet nationalities, with a daily circulation of tens of millions of copies. The editorial points out that Soviet newspapers are loved, trusted, and supported by the people.

"Pravda" then discusses the tasks of Soviet newspapers. It emphasizes that Soviet newspapers must continue to actively participate in the struggle to promote the further development of the motherland's economy, and must use Bolshevik persuasiveness to promote socialist emulation, introduce the experiences of advanced individuals to the masses, encourage the creative and enterprising spirit of the masses, and promote criticism from below. To ensure the effectiveness of Soviet newspapers' work, it is necessary to expand the ranks of active contributors and increase the number of worker-peasant correspondents.

"Pravda" continues, Soviet newspapers bear a lofty responsibility in educating the working people in the spirit of life-giving Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and in the spirit of friendship among all nationalities. Soviet newspapers have won the respect of the working people of all countries for fighting against the ideology of the imperialist bourgeoisie, for exposing the conspiracies of the new war instigators, and for actively participating in the struggle to defend world peace.

The hired newspapers of the bourgeoisie incite war psychology, attempting to deceive the masses with lies, and inciting one nation against another. Soviet newspapers, on the other hand, warmly call on the masses to strive for peace, consolidate friendship between all nationalities, instill in the people confidence in their own strength, and call on them to fight for the freedom and happiness of all nations.

"Pravda" concludes, together with the newspapers of the People's Republic of China and the People's Democracies, and with all progressive newspapers, Soviet newspapers are a very powerful force in the great struggle for peace.

Today's "Pravda" published a lengthy essay by Ilyichev, providing a detailed analysis of newspapers in socialist countries. Many newspaper editors from all over the Soviet Union published articles in "Pravda" today, introducing the activities of local newspapers and describing how they are fulfilling their tasks. "Pravda" also published an essay by Velichko, introducing the newspaper "Struggle for Bolshevik Speed" of the builders of the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power project.

"Pravda" reported that in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tashkent, Riga, and other cities, enterprises, educational institutions, and other organizations are preparing to hold lectures, discussions, and gatherings on Soviet newspapers. "Pravda" also published an article from Beijing by Deng Tuo, editor-in-chief of the Chinese "People's Daily," entitled "A Powerful Weapon for the Struggle for a New Life." In this article, he introduced the status of newspapers in the People's Republic of China and the work of the editorial department of "People's Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    苏联热烈庆祝布尔什维克出版节
    “真理报”发表论述苏联报纸任务的社论和专文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：今天，全苏联都在庆祝布尔什维克出版节。四十年前，即一九一二年五月五日，按照列宁的指示，并且在斯大林的发起下，布尔什维克的群众报纸“真理报”创刊了。每年的五月五日，苏联都举行一次报纸的检阅。布尔什维克党报日已成了苏联人民传统的节日。“真理报”今天发表的社论强调说：苏联的报纸是一种新型的报纸，它忠诚地为建设共产主义的人民的利益服务。它向人民大众传播崇高的布尔什维克真理的言论，传播无往不克的列宁主义的思想。
    “真理报”指出，现在，苏联全国以苏联各民族语文出版的报纸总共有八千多种，每日销数在数千万份。社论指出，苏联的报纸为人民所热爱，而且获得人民的信任和支持。
    “真理报”接着论到苏联报纸的任务。它强调指出，苏联报纸必须继续积极地参加促进祖国经济进一步发展的斗争，必须以布尔什维克的说服力来推动社会主义竞赛，把先进人物的经验介绍给千千万万的人民，鼓舞大众的创造进取精神，推动自下面来的批评。为了使苏联报纸的工作取得成效，必须扩大积极投稿者的阵容，增加工农通讯员的数量。
    “真理报”继续说，苏联报纸以赋与生命的苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神来教育劳动人民，以各民族友好的精神教育劳动人民，在这方面担负着崇高的任务。苏联报纸因为与帝国主义资产阶级思想进行斗争，因为揭露新战争挑拨者的阴谋，因为积极地进行保卫全世界和平的斗争，获得了各国劳动人民的尊重。
    资产阶级的雇佣报纸在煽动战争心理，企图以谎话来欺骗千千万万的人民，挑拨一个民族去反对另外一个民族。而苏联报纸则热烈地号召人民大众争取和平、巩固各民族间的友谊，并向人民灌输对自己的力量的信心，号召他们为争取各族人民的自由和幸福而奋斗。
    “真理报”最后说，和中华人民共和国及各人民民主国家的报纸在一起，和所有进步报纸在一起，苏联报纸就是伟大的争取和平的斗争中的一支非常巨大的力量。
    今天的“真理报”登载了伊利且夫的长篇论文，对社会主义国家的报纸作了详尽的分析。全苏联各地许多报纸的编辑今天在“真理报”上发表文章，介绍地方报纸的活动，并叙述它们怎样完成它们的任务。“真理报”还登载了维里奇科的一篇论文，介绍了齐姆良水力发电工程建设者的报纸“争取布尔什维克式的进展速度”。
    “真理报”报道说：在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、塔什干、里加和其他城市，各企业、教育机关和其他机关都筹备举办关于苏联报纸的演讲会、讨论会和集会。“真理报”也刊载了中国“人民日报”总编辑邓拓自北京寄来的一篇文章：“为新生活而斗争的有力武器”。他在这篇文章里向读者介绍了报纸在中华人民共和国的地位，并介绍了“人民日报”——中国共产党中央机关报——编辑部的工作。
