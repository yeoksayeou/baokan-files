    Certain Administrative Leaders of State-Owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory
    Actually Refuse to Promote the "1951 Weaving Work Method"
    Causing Chaos in the Factory's Weaving Work Methods and Increasing the Defective Cloth Rate
    Certain administrative leaders of the State-Owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as the Eighth Factory) have serious individualistic heroic thinking, are arrogant and complacent, resist the promotion of the "1951 Weaving Work Method," and vainly attempt to create their own system. As a result, the promotion of advanced work methods throughout the factory has fallen into a state of chaos, and the defective cloth rate has increased.
    From December of last year to January of this year, when the Eighth Factory began to focus on promoting the "1951 Weaving Work Method," under the direct leadership of the promotion team composed of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union and the Qingdao Textile Management Branch Bureau, the workers worked hard to learn and achieved certain results. However, at the beginning of April, it was discovered that the work method was in a state of confusion. On April 10, Ding Wen, the production director of the Municipal Textile Trade Union, Huang Jianhua, the chief engineer of the Textile Management Branch Bureau, Wang Ziping, an engineer from the Fifth Factory, Chen Fengming, a substitute engineer from the Fourth Factory, experienced cloth inspectors from the cloth inspection rooms of the Fourth and Seventh Factories, and some outstanding workers who participated in the
    summation of the "1951 Weaving Work Method," such as Sun Xiuzhen, Wang Xiulan, and Wang Shumei, went to the weaving workshop to conduct an on-site inspection.
    Based on the inspection results, they discovered the following serious situations: (1) According to the "1951 Weaving Work Method," weaving machine operators should adopt a two-to-one patrol route, regularly inspecting the cloth surface and warp beams and handling downtime. However, the workers in the weaving workshop have completely abandoned the patrol inspection work and have reverted to the old habit of running around in the machine rows. As a result, yarn defects cause thread breaks and defective cloth, or defective cloth is not discovered in time because it is wound over the cloth roll. The inspectors discovered on the spot: machine number 271 had 37 yards of thick warp threads, machine number 98 had 17 inches of broken defects, and another machine had more than 25 inches of broken defects. (2) One of the characteristics of the "1951 Weaving Work Method" is being good at distinguishing between the important and the urgent and making flexible use of time. If the time spent handling downtime in a certain patrol is long, the walking speed should be faster and less inspection work should be done. If there is less downtime to handle, more inspection work can be done and done more carefully. In this way, the busy and flustered state of the machine operators can be appropriately reduced, making them feel that the work is easy. However, the weaving workers of the Eighth Factory do not do this, but instead run around in the machine rows in the old way; wherever a machine stops, the operator goes there to restart it. Sun Xiuzhen, an outstanding weaving worker who participated in the summation of the "1951 Weaving Work Method," felt that it was impossible to take measurements when she took out a stopwatch to prepare for timing. She said, "They are not using the '1951 Weaving Work Method'; most of it is the old way." (3) Another basic characteristic of the "1951 Weaving Work Method" is the rational organization of various actions. Because weaving work is a series of repetitive actions, it must be carried out in accordance with certain regulations. Some machine operators are still doing a good job in handling downtime and keeping scissors in hand; the general actions of most workers are also carried out in accordance with regulations. However, a small number of workers still maintain the old habit of not keeping scissors in hand and not using hooks to thread through the heddle eyes when splicing warp threads, resulting in more downtime. One worker watching 20 machines had as many as seven machines stopped at once.
    The inspectors also went to the finishing workshop to check the actual condition of the cloth. They randomly selected five packages (a total of 100 pieces) of regular cloth that had been packed and re-inspected them. As a result, 12 pieces of defective cloth were found; among them, six pieces could still be repaired into regular cloth, and the remaining six pieces were definitely defective cloth. If calculated according to the results of the re-inspection, the defective cloth rate is at least above 6 percent.
    The reason why the "1951 Weaving Work Method" cannot be promoted in the Eighth Factory is mainly because Deputy Director Yang Guangxu, Director of the Weaving Workshop Ding Ruifu, and others have serious individualistic heroic thinking, and have adopted a perfunctory or even a rejecting attitude towards the "1951 Weaving Work Method," wanting to create their own weaving method to show off. In December of last year, when the "1951 Weaving Work Method" promotion team of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Trade Union and the Municipal Textile Management Branch Bureau was conducting key promotion in the Eighth Factory, Factory Director Tang Botao and Deputy Director Yang Guangxu not only did not actively take responsibility for the promotion, but often used the excuse of being busy with work to avoid attending meetings related to the promotion work; they also selected a group of workers to engage in their own so-called work method of "no patrolling, no inspecting warp beams." Later, after the promotion team left the Eighth Factory, the factory director and deputy director simply overturned the "1951 Weaving Work Method" and implemented their own system, claiming that this was the "large maneuver" of the "1951 Weaving Work Method." What is even more intolerable is that they recklessly exaggerated their achievements in the "Three-Anti" movement, and, disregarding the reputation of state-owned cotton textile factories, mixed defective cloth into regular cloth to cover up the fact that the defective cloth rate had increased. For example, in their ten-day and monthly reports, they reported that the defective cloth rate in the first ten days of April was 0.35 percent, and in March it was 0.36 percent; but according to the spot check on April 10, it was at least above 6 percent.
    The factory's Party committee and trade union should also bear important responsibility for the incident of administrative leaders openly resisting the implementation of the "1951 Weaving Work Method." When the promotion team of the Municipal Textile Trade Union and the Municipal Textile Management Branch Bureau was conducting key promotion work in the Eighth Factory, they did not pay enough attention to and support the work. After the key promotion ended, they did not formulate a plan to consolidate the initial promotion results and further promote the work in a comprehensive and in-depth manner. On weekdays, they used the excuse of not understanding technology to almost completely ignore the promotion work. After the "Three-Anti" movement began, they again used the excuse of being "busy" with work and allowed the administrative leaders to manipulate the promotion work at will. What is even more serious is that they clearly knew that Yang Guangxu's and others' practices were wrong, but they did not launch a struggle, did not defend the rational and advanced work method, and adopted a laissez-faire attitude. Therefore, they objectively contributed to the arrogance and conservative thinking of Yang Guangxu and others, causing unnecessary losses and adverse effects.
    Currently, as a result of the Eighth Factory's implementation of its own work method, the defective cloth rate has greatly increased, and the vast majority of weaving workers have begun to doubt the superiority of the "1951 Weaving Work Method." In order to promptly stop this serious situation and correct the adverse effects, the relevant leading authorities should quickly take action to deal with it.

    国营青岛第八棉纺织厂某些行政领导干部
    竟拒绝推广“一九五一织布工作法”
    全厂的织布工作方法陷于混乱状态，次布率增加
    国营青岛第八棉纺织厂（以下简称八厂）某些行政领导干部有严重的个人英雄主义思想，骄傲自满，抗拒推广“一九五一织布工作法”，妄想自己独搞一套。结果，全厂先进工作法的推广工作陷于混乱状态，次布率增加。
    去年十二月到今年一月，八厂开始重点推广“一九五一织布工作法”时，在纺织工会青岛市委员会和青岛纺织管理分局所组成的推广组直接主持下，职工努力学习，曾经收到一定的成绩。但在四月初，就发现工作法有混乱的情形。四月十日，纺织工会市委员会生产部长丁文、纺织管理分局总工程师黄建华、五厂工程师王子屏、四厂代工程师陈凤鸣、四厂和七厂验布间验布老工人及一部分参加
    “一九五一织布工作法”总结工作的优秀工人孙秀贞、王秀兰、王淑美等，到织布车间作实地检查。
    根据检查结果，他们发现如下的严重情况：（一）根据“一九五一织布工作法”，织布值车工应采用二比一的巡回路线，经常检查布面和经轴及处理停台。但是，织布车间工人已根本取消了巡回检查工作，而恢复了在车档乱跑的老样子。结果，因经纱疵点而出了断头和次布，或因次布卷过卷布棍而不能及时发现次布。检查人员当场发现：二七一号车有粗经三十七码，九十八号车有断疵十七寸，另一台车则有断疵二十五寸多。（二）“一九五一织布工作法”的特点之一，是善于分清轻重缓急，灵活运用时间。如果某一巡回中处理停台时间多，行走速度就要快些，检查工作就要少做一些。如果处理停台少，检查工作就可多作并且作得仔细一些，这样，可以适当减少值车工的忙乱现象，使值车工感到工作轻松。但是，八厂的织布工人却不这样作，而是老一套地在车档里乱跑；那里停车，值车工就到那里去开车。参加总结“一九五一织布工作法”的织布优秀工人孙秀贞，拿了码表准备测定时，感到根本无法进行测定。她说：“用的不是‘一九五一织布工作法’，大部分是过去的一套。”（三）“一九五一织布工作法”的另一个基本特点，是合理组织各项动作。因为织布工作是一连串的重复动作，必须按照一定的规定来进行。部分值车工，在停台处理和剪刀不离手等方面还做的较好；大部分工人的一般动作也是照规定进行的。但也有小部分工人，还是保持着老一套的剪刀不在手、经纱接头时不用钩子穿住落片等习惯，造成停台多的现象。有一个看二十台车的工人，最多时一下停了七台。
    检查人员又到整理车间去查看布的实际情况。他们把已打成包的正布，抽出五包（共一百匹）重新检验。结果，验出次布十二匹；其中尚能修好成正布的有六匹，其余六匹则是地地道道的次布。如果按照重验结果推算，次布率至少在百分之六以上。
    “一九五一织布工作法”所以不能在八厂推广，主要是副厂长杨光煦、织布车间主任丁瑞甫等有严重的个人英雄主义思想，对“一九五一织布工作法”采取了敷衍以至拒绝的态度，想自己另搞一套织布法，出出风头。在去年十二月间，当纺织工会青岛市委员会和市纺织管理分局的“一九五一织布工作法”推广组在八厂进行重点推广时，厂长唐伯涛、副厂长杨光煦，不但不积极负起推广的责任，反而往往藉口工作忙，不参加有关推广工作的会议；并另抽出一部分工人，去搞自己的所谓“不巡回、不检查经轴”的工作法。后来，推广组离开八厂以后，正副厂长就索性把“一九五一织布工作法”推翻，实行自己的一套，还说这是“一九五一织布工作法”的“大机动”。更不能容忍的是：他们竟在“三反”运动中，大肆虚报成绩，而且不顾国营棉纺织厂的信誉，把次布混到正布中去，以掩盖次布率增加的事实。如他们在旬报、月报上报告四月上旬的次布率是百分之零点三五，三月份报告的是百分之零点三六；而根据四月十日的抽查结果，却至少在百分之六以上。
    这个工厂的党委和工会，对行政领导干部公开抗拒实行“一九五一织布工作法”的事件，也应负重要责任。当纺织工会市委员会和市纺织管理分局的推广组在八厂作重点推广工作时，他们对这工作就不够重视和支持。重点推广结束后，他们也没有拟定巩固初步推广成绩和进一步普遍深入推广的计划。平日，他们藉口不懂技术，对推广工作几乎是不闻不问。“三反”运动开始以后，他们又藉口工作“忙”，听任行政领导干部把推广工作随便摆布。更严重的是，他们明明知道杨光煦等的作法不对，但却不开展斗争，不去保卫合理的先进工作法，而采取听之任之的态度。因此，他们在客观上就助长了杨光煦等人的自高自大和保守思想，造成不应有的损失和不良影响。
    目前，八厂因另搞一套工作法的结果，次布率大增，且使广大织布工人对“一九五一织布工作法”的优越性发生了怀疑。为及时制止这种严重情况和纠正不良影响，有关领导机关应迅速加以处理。
