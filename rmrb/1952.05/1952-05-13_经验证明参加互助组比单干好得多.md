    Experience Proves Joining Mutual Aid Teams is Much Better Than Working Alone
    To the Editor: I used to be ideologically backward and only thought about my own interests. I always wanted to do small business because it was easy to make money. I thought that working in the fields was hard work, so I looked down on agricultural production and was unwilling to join the mutual aid team, fearing that I would not be free after joining. I thought that in May, the sun was scorching like fire, and if I worked alone, I could choose not to go to the fields whenever I wanted, but I couldn't be so casual if I joined the mutual aid team. But last autumn, two of my family of three fell ill. Seeing that the crops in the fields were ripe, and the crops of the mutual aid team had all been harvested, my crops were still in the fields untouched. I thought of hiring someone, but everyone was busy and couldn't be hired. Later, the crops in the fields were damaged by wind, rain, and insects because they were harvested late, resulting in a loss of more than one stone of grain. This is the result of working alone! From then on, I understood the benefits of friendship and cooperation in the mutual aid team, and later I asked to join the mutual aid team. Because I had suffered losses from working alone, I worked actively in the mutual aid team. This year, in the spring plowing and drought prevention campaign, I was also elected as a model for drought resistance. I really feel both ashamed and honored, and I must work harder in the future. I hope that the peasant brothers who are still working alone will join the mutual aid teams as soon as possible!

    经验证明参加互助组比单干好得多
    编辑同志：我以前思想落后，只为个人利益打算。我总想做小买卖，因为容易赚钱。我认为上地劳动苦，所以轻视地里的生产，不愿参加互助组，怕参加了不自由。我想，在五月天里，太阳晒得像火烧，自己单干的话想不下地就不下地，参加互助组就不能这样随便了。可是去年秋收时，我家三口人就病倒了两口，眼看地里的庄稼熟了，互助组的庄稼都收割了，我的庄稼还长在地里没有动。心想雇人吧，人们都忙，雇不到。后来地里的庄稼因为收割晚，被风吹雨淋和虫吃，共计损失了一石多粮。这就是单干的结果啊！我从那时起，算是明白了参加互助组友爱合作的好处了，以后我就要求参加了互助组。因为我是吃过单干亏的，所以在互助组里积极劳动。今年在春耕防旱运动中，我还被大家选为抗旱模范。我真是觉得又惭愧又光荣，往后我一定要更加努力。我希望现在还在单干的农民兄弟们赶快参加互助吧！
