    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province,
    Should Not Violate the Contract and Reduce the Purchase Price of Local Products Without Authorization

    To the Editor: The Jiaozuo Local Products Company of Pingyuan Province signed a contract with the Yuanyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in November of last year for the purchase of crude alkali and homespun cloth. However, the Yuanyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative violated the contract and privately lowered the purchase price to make a profit, which is very wrong. For example, the originally agreed purchase price was: 2,000 yuan per catty for first-class alkali, 1,800 yuan per catty for second-class alkali, and 1,300 yuan per catty for third-class alkali. However, when purchasing, the cooperative actually reduced the price of first-class alkali to 1,200 yuan per catty, second-class alkali to 800 yuan per catty, and third-class alkali to 600 yuan per catty. The original price for standard cloth (homespun) was 1,000 yuan per square foot, but the cooperative actually paid only 966 yuan per square foot when purchasing from disaster victims.

    After discovering this situation, the Jiaozuo Local Products Company sent Wang Hailin, the chief of the storage and transportation section, to investigate on March 16. He first investigated with the Yuanyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and then went to the county cooperative to understand the situation. The director of the county cooperative refused to admit his mistake and had a very bad attitude. The next day, Wang Hailin went to the disaster-stricken villages of Dabingji, Taipingzhen, Guozhuang, and Shuanglouwang to conduct on-the-spot investigations, which confirmed that the masses were very dissatisfied with the cooperative's reduction of purchase prices. Wang Youzhi, a disaster victim from Dabingji, said, "The first time I went to the cooperative to sell alkali, it was 1,200 yuan per catty. The second time I went to sell it, the price was reduced to 600 yuan per catty. The third time I went to sell it, the county cooperative wouldn't accept it." The director of the Guozhuang Village Cooperative said, "The agreement we signed with the county cooperative was 2,000 yuan for first-class alkali, 1,800 yuan for second-class alkali, and 1,300 yuan for third-class alkali; but when we sent the crude alkali, the county cooperative cut the price in half." This practice of the Yuanyang County Cooperative not only directly harmed the interests of the disaster victims, but also undermined the prestige of the government and the supply and marketing cooperative. I think the leading cadres of the county cooperative should make a profound self-criticism.　Yan Huiqin

### 平原省原阳县供销社  不该违反合同擅自降低收购土产的价

    平原省原阳县供销社
    不该违反合同擅自降低收购土产的价格
    编辑同志：平原省焦作土产公司在去年十一月和原阳县供销社订立了收购土碱、土布合同，但原阳县供销社违反合同规定，私自降低收购价格，从中取利，这是很不对的。如原议定的收购价格为：头等碱每斤二千元，二等碱每斤一千八百元，三等碱每斤一千三百元。但收购时，该社竟把头等碱降至每斤一千二百元，二等碱降至每斤八百元，三等碱降至每斤六百元。收购标准布（土布）原定价每方尺一千元，但该社在向灾民收购时，实付的款却是每方尺九百六十六元。
    焦作土产公司发觉这种情况后，就在三月十六日派储运科长王海林前往调查。他首先向中共原阳县委调查，又到县社了解情况。该县社主任拒不承认错误，而且态度很坏。第二天王海林又亲到灾区大宾集、太平镇、郭庄、双楼王等重灾村进行实地调查，证实群众对于该社降低收购价格很不满意。大宾集灾民王有志说：“第一次去合作社卖碱，每斤是一千二百元，第二次去卖时，每斤就降低为六百元，第三次去卖，县社就不收了。”郭庄村合作社主任说：“我们和县合作社订的协议是一等碱二千元，二等碱一千八百元，三等碱一千三百元；但等我们送去土碱时，县社就掉价一半。”原阳县合作社这种作法，不但直接损害了灾民的利益，而且破坏了政府与供销社的威信。我认为该县社领导干部应作深刻的检讨。　阎惠琴
