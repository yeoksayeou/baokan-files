To the CCP Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and Huaiyin Special District Office:

Should Thoroughly Investigate Cases of Corruption and Malpractice in Disaster Relief and the Yi River Diversion Project

To the Editor: Based on the materials published by Comrade Sun Boren in the Subei Daily on February 3rd and my personal understanding of some situations, I wrote a letter to the Subei Daily requesting the CCP Huaiyin Local Committee and the Huaiyin Special District Office to thoroughly investigate cases of corruption and malpractice in disaster relief and the Yi River Diversion Project, and also requested the relevant parties to make a public self-criticism on the Subei Daily. The Subei Daily published my letter on February 10th, which aroused the attention of many readers. Readers wrote to the Subei Daily one after another, continuing to expose the facts of corruption and malpractice in the Huaiyin Special District in disaster relief and the Yi River Diversion Project. However, for more than three months, the relevant parties have still not made a public response to this matter.

At the beginning of February, the "Three-Anti" Movement began, and the CCP Huaiyin Local Committee convened a meeting of party representatives from the directly affiliated organs of the Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office. At the meeting, serious phenomena of corruption and malpractice in the Production Department of the Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office were exposed. Judging from the materials exposed by Comrade Sun Boren, the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office have pushed this mistake and responsibility to Zhang Pin'san, the director of the Organ Production Department who has been suspended from his duties for inspection. I think it is right to suspend Zhang Pin'san from his duties for inspection, but the leading cadres of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office should also conduct a self-criticism. Because without the approval or acquiescence of the responsible persons of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office, the Organ Production Department would not dare to blatantly engage in large-scale malpractice in disaster relief and the Yi River Diversion Project. If the responsible persons of the Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office said that they knew nothing about the matter of mobilizing more than one billion yuan and more than one hundred thousand jin of grain, then their bureaucracy is also extremely serious. Because some people in the organs of the Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office were engaged in corruption and malpractice in the disaster relief and Yi River Diversion funds, some bad elements below naturally became bolder in embezzling disaster relief and Yi River Diversion funds. Later, according to the continued exposure by readers, it was proved that this situation was serious.

The Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office once sent the Subei Daily a "reply" on February 13th that was not very thorough in its self-criticism. The Subei Daily did not publish it, and wrote a letter asking them to re-examine and reply, but there has been no result until now.

The responsible persons of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office are not satisfied with the criticism of the party newspaper with such a frivolous attitude. In order to be responsible to the party and the people, I think it is necessary to thoroughly investigate this matter and pursue responsibility. I request the relevant responsible persons in the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee and the Special District Office to make a serious public self-criticism in the party newspaper.

### 中共淮阴地委和淮阴专署  应彻查救灾与导沂工程中的贪污舞弊案

专栏：读者来信

    中共淮阴地委和淮阴专署
    应彻查救灾与导沂工程中的贪污舞弊案
    编辑同志：我曾根据二月三日孙伯仁同志在苏北日报上发表的材料及我个人所了解的一些情况，写了一封信给苏北日报，要求中共淮阴地方委员会和淮阴专署彻查救灾和导沂工程中的贪污舞弊案，并要求有关方面在苏北日报上对此作公开检讨。苏北日报在二月十日发表了我写的信，引起许多读者的重视。读者并纷纷写信给苏北日报，继续揭发淮阴专区在救灾和导沂工程中的贪污舞弊事实。但是，三个多月了，有关方面对这件事仍然没有作公开答复。
    二月初，“三反”运动开始，中共淮阴地方委员会召开地委和专署直属机关党代表会议；会上揭发了地委、专署机关生产处严重的贪污舞弊现象。从孙伯仁同志揭发的材料上看，淮阴地委、专署已把这种错误和责任推给已被停职检查的机关生产处主任张品三。我认为停职检查张品三是应该的，但是，淮阴地委、专署的领导干部也应当进行检查。因为如果不经淮阴地委、专署负责人的批准或默许，机关生产处就不敢明目张胆地在救灾和导沂工程中大肆舞弊。如果说地委、专署的负责人对于动用十几亿元、十几万斤粮食的事情一点也不知道，那么他们的官僚主义也可见是多么严重了。由于地委、专署机关内有人在救灾和导沂经费中贪污舞弊，下边有些坏分子当然也就更大胆地贪污救灾和导沂的经费。后来根据读者的继续揭发，证明这种情况是严重的。
    淮阴地委、专署对于此事曾经在二月十三日送给苏北日报一个检查得极不深刻的“答复”。苏北日报没有刊登，并写信请他们重新检查答复，可是直到现在还没有结果。
    淮阴地委、专署的负责人，以这种轻率的态度对待党报的批评，是令人不能满意的。为了对党对人民负责到底，我认为，必须彻底清查这件事，并追究责任。我要求淮阴地委、专署中有关的负责人，在党报上作严肃的公开的检讨。    李汉章
