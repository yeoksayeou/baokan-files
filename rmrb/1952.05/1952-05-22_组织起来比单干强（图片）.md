    Organizing is Better than Going it Alone
    By Li Qun, Zhang Huaixin, Yao Heng, Ji Lin, Hao Chao, Yun Ting
    (Twenty-five) Wang Quanbao was afraid of losing out, so he withdrew from the mutual aid team, but as a result, he lost out because he withdrew from the mutual aid team. After much thought, he felt that he had really made a mistake. So he went to the Party branch secretary Zhang Weimin and said, "I didn't listen to you, I took the wrong path."
    (Twenty-six) After Zhang Weimin and Li Sixiao discussed it, they convened a meeting of the mutual aid team members. Everyone discussed Wang Quanbao's problem and received an education, feeling that the capitalist road of wealthy peasants was a dead end. In the end, everyone approved his rejoining the mutual aid team. Wang Quanbao returned to the mutual aid team, made a profound self-criticism, and began by saying: "I have let down Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao called on us to organize, but I didn't listen to him and suffered a loss. From now on, I will follow him forever, all the way to socialism and communism." (The End)

    （二十五）王全保怕吃亏，退出了互助组，可是结果因为退出互助组，才吃了亏。他前思后想，觉得实在做错啦。他于是找党支部书记张为民说：“我没有听你的话，路算走错啦。”
    （二十六）张为民和李四小商量后，就开互助组组员大会。大家讨论了王全保的问题，都受到了教育，觉得资本主义的富农道路走不通。最后全体批准他重新加入互助组。王全保重新回到互助组里，他做了深刻的检讨，一开头就说：“我对不起毛主席。毛主席号召我们组织起来，我不听他的话，吃了亏。从现在起，我要永远跟他走，一直走到社会主义共产主义。”    （完）
