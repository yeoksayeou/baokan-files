    To the Editor: Zhang Ji'an, locomotive driver chief of Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, strengthened his sense of responsibility towards his work after the "Three-Anti" campaign and recently prevented a major accident. On April 18, locomotive No. ㄇㄎ1-1551 of Train 725 was traveling from Zhangjiakou to Datong. When starting the train, Zhang Ji'an heard a noise from the crank and made an inspection mid-way. The inspection revealed that all the screws were tight and there were no problems. However, the crank still made noise. When he arrived in Datong, he checked again, and the result was the same as during the mid-way inspection. Zhang Ji'an felt very strange. On the 19th, the train returned to Zhangjiakou, and the noise from the crank became louder and louder during the journey. Zhang Ji'an immediately called the dispatcher's office to report the situation. After arriving at the depot, inspector Zhao Jinbao and the factory director, among others, came to inspect. Zhao Jinbao pondered repeatedly and concluded that there was a problem with the cylinder. After observing the actual situation, Depot Chief Li Yutian agreed with Zhao Jinbao's opinion. When they dismantled the cylinder for inspection, they discovered that there was indeed a problem with the gudgeon pin bearing. Everyone immediately repaired it. If this hidden accident of the locomotive had not been detected, and the locomotive had continued to haul trains, the train would have been forced to stop mid-way due to the cylinder frame breaking. This would not only have delayed the train schedule, but the locomotive would have been damaged and sent to the factory for repairs. It would have taken a considerable amount of time, causing undue losses to the country. Thanks to the prior vigilance of driver chief Zhang Ji'an, this accident was avoided. Zhang Ji'an's sense of responsibility towards his work is worthy of praise.

    张家口机务段司机长张吉安
    加强责任心防止了重大事故
    编辑同志：张家口机务段司机长张吉安，经过“三反”运动，对工作加强了责任感，最近防止了一件重大事故。四月十八日，七二五次列车冖ㄎ１一五五一号机车从张家口开往大同。开车时，张吉安听到曲拐有响声，就在中途作了一次检查，检查结果，知道各部螺丝都紧，没出毛病。但曲拐仍有响声。到了大同，他再检查一次，结果和在中途检查时的情况相同。张吉安心里奇怪极了。十九日，列车开回张家口，途中曲拐的响声越来越大了。张吉安立即把这种情况打电话通知了调度所。到段后，检查员赵金豹和工厂主任等都来检查。赵金豹一再琢磨，认为是汽缸出了毛病。李玉田段长观察实际情况后，同意赵金豹的意见。他们把汽缸拆了检查时，发现果然勾贝体有了毛病。大家立即把它修好。这次如果检查不出机车的隐形事故，又去牵引列车，中途一定会因汽缸架破损而致列车停放。这样不但会延误行车，而且机车坏了送厂修理。需相当长的时间，会给国家造成不应有的损失。由于司机长张吉安事先提高了警惕，才避免了这次事故。张吉安对工作的责任心是值得表扬的。
