The leading cadres of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau criticized conservative thinking in the "Three-Anti" movement, reviewed the work of promoting the new coal mining method, and focused on promoting the Soviet advanced method of dense prop roof management. By the end of March, this method had been successfully tested. As early as March 1951, when the Fengfeng Mining Bureau was testing the new coal mining method, someone suggested using dense props to manage the roof. At that time, the Fengfeng Mining Bureau was using wood-stack duckbill canopies to manage the roof. This method could not meet the requirements of the new coal mining method because the wood-stacks shrank greatly, the pressure of the roof was concentrated on the wood-stacks, the wood-stacks could not support it, and the roof easily subsided. Although the leading cadres of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau verbally agreed to adopt the dense prop method at that time, they were not confident. Most cadres and workers did not understand, and they believed: "Although the wood-stack duckbill canopy shrinks greatly, the wood-stack is large, which is safer than using single props; the roof subsidence and cracking is because the roof is not good..." Therefore, the dense prop roof management method was not adopted at that time.

In the "Three-Anti" movement, leading cadres at all levels liquidated the influence of bourgeois ideology, criticized conservative views on technological improvement, and made profound self-criticisms to the masses of workers. Then, a production conference was held, and it was decided to focus on the trial implementation of the dense prop roof management method in Mine No. 1, and eight technicians were sent to help Mine No. 1 conduct the experiment.

On February 24, local experiments began at the No. 1 Mine's Left 18th Main Tunnel, Face 112, and Right 4th Main Tunnel, Face 116. Initially, several experiments failed. However, because the masses were enthusiastic, and the leading cadres and technicians went deep into the site to solve problems, they finally overcame the difficulties, and the experiment was completely successful. In order to cautiously find the rules of the props, they first conducted a partial experiment in a 6-meter-long area of Face 112 (the face was 80 meters long). As a result, most of the "props" were broken. Some workers therefore increased their concerns. The leading cadres then held a meeting of technicians and advanced producers, conducting ideological education for the workers on the one hand, and continuing to study improvement methods on the other. They divided the 80-meter-long face into two halves, one half using the dense prop method and the other half using the original wood-stack duckbill canopy method. The results of the experiment were: the roof of the part using wood-stacks cracked and subsided by about half a Chinese foot, most of the duckbill canopies were broken, which affected the work, and the coal quality did not change; the props of the part using props were intact, the roof did not crack, the work was convenient, and at the same time, because the roof pressure was concentrated on the coal wall, the coal quality became softer. This proved the superiority of the dense prop roof management method. Because the workers used their brains to come up with many methods, other difficulties were also overcome one by one. On March 29, Face 116 was also successfully tested.

The superiority of the dense prop roof management method is reflected in all aspects. 1. The method is simple and much safer than using wood-stacks. In April, after Face 116 used the dense prop roof management method, it created a new record for safe production. 2. It saves labor and materials and reduces costs. A production team that previously needed six carpenters now only needs three carpenters. The caving team originally used thirty-two workers, but now only sixteen workers are needed. In terms of labor alone, more than 120,000 catties of millet can be saved a year. In terms of materials, in the past, because the roof was not well managed, the duckbill canopy was often damaged by more than 80%, and the wood-stacks could not be fully recovered. After adopting the dense prop method, more than 95% of the pit wood can be recovered, and the pit wood consumption rate per ton is greatly reduced. Face 112 saved pit wood, and the cost per ton of coal was reduced by nearly 4,000 yuan. The average daily cost reduction for the entire face was 1.8 million yuan. 3. The coal mining efficiency has been greatly improved. After using the dense prop method, it is convenient for workers to walk on the face, and the coal quality is softened, which is convenient for extraction. After the successful trial of this method on Face 112, the efficiency increased from 1.4529 tons of coal to 3.6867 tons of coal. Calculated with 130 people on the two faces, nearly 100,000 tons of coal can be produced annually, worth 10 billion yuan.

    峰峰矿务局在三反运动中批判了保守思想
    试行密集支柱管理顶板法每年增产百亿元
    “三反”运动中，峰峰矿务局的领导干部批判了保守思想，对推行新采煤法的工作作了检查，重点推行了苏联先进的密集支柱管理顶板的办法。三月底，这个办法已经试验成功。早在一九五一年三月，峰峰矿务局试验新采煤法时，就曾有人建议改用密集支柱的办法来管理顶板。当时峰峰矿务局是使用木垛鸭嘴棚子的方法来管理顶板，这种方法是不能适应新采煤方法的要求的，因为木垛收缩性大，顶板的压力集中于木垛，木垛支持不住，顶板容易下沉。峰峰矿务局的领导干部当时虽然在口头上同意采用密集支柱的方法，但是信心不高。大部分干部和工人的思想也不通，他们认为：“木垛鸭嘴棚子虽然收缩性大，但是木垛堆大，总比用单支柱安全；顶板下沉破裂，那是因为顶板不好……”因此，密集支柱管理顶板的方法，当时就没有被采纳。
    在“三反”运动中，各级领导干部清算了资产阶级的思想影响，批判了在技术改进上的保守观点，并向工人群众作了深刻的检讨。接着，召开了生产会议，决定在一矿重点试行密集支柱管理顶板法，并派出八个技术人员，帮助一矿进行试验。
    二月二十四日，在一矿左十八大巷一一二掌子和右四大巷一一六掌子开始进行局部试验。最初，几次试验都失败了。但是，因为群众情绪高昂，领导干部和技术人员深入现场解决问题，终于克服了困难，试验完全成功。为了谨慎地寻找支柱的规律，他们先在一一二掌子的六公尺长的地区进行局部试验（掌子面长八十公尺），结果“支柱”大部折断。一部分工人因此增加了顾虑。领导干部接着召开了技术人员和先进生产者的会议，一面对工人进行思想教育，一面继续研究改进的办法。他们把八十公尺的掌子面分为两半，一半用密集支柱的办法，一半仍用原来的木垛鸭嘴棚子的办法。试验的结果是：使用木垛部分的顶板，破裂下沉约有半市尺，鸭嘴棚子大部折断，影响了工作，煤质无变化；使用支柱的部分，支柱完好，顶板未裂，工作方便，同时，因顶板压力集中于煤壁，煤质变软。这就证明了密集支柱管理顶板方法的优越性。由于工人开动脑筋想出许多办法，把其他的困难也都一一克服了。三月二十九日，一一六掌子面也试验成功了。
    密集支柱管理顶板办法的优越性表现在各方面。一、用法简单，而且比使用木垛安全得多。四月份，一一六掌子面使用密集支柱管理顶板办法以后，创造了安全生产的新纪录。二、省工省料，降低了成本。以前需六个木工的生产班，现在只需三个木工就够了。放顶班原来用三十二个工，现在只用十六个工就行了。单只人工方面，一年就可节省十二万多斤小米。在材料方面，过去因为对顶板管理得不好，鸭嘴棚常被压坏百分之八十以上，木垛亦不能全部回收。采取密集支柱办法后，坑木能回收百分之九十五以上，坑木吨耗率大大降低。一一二掌子面，因为节约了坑木，每吨煤降低成本将近四千元。全掌子面平均每日降低成本一百八十万元。三、采煤效率大大提高。使用密集支柱的办法后，工人在掌子面行走方便，同时煤质软化，便于回采。一一二掌子试验这种办法成功后，效率由一点四五二九吨煤提高到三点六八六七吨煤，两个掌子面以一百三十人计算，一年可增产将近十万吨煤，价值一百亿元。    （洪光烈、郝赞质）
