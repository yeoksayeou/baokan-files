    Investigation Report on the Integration of Wanglanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative and Mutual Aid Groups in Fengnan County, Hebei Province for Collective Cotton Purchasing and Sales
    Huaibei Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office
    The Wanglanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengnan County is a joint village cooperative centered on the market town. The community includes forty-two village cooperatives, 5,508 households, 30,364 people, and 84,150 mu of land. There are 15,837 members, accounting for 52% of the local total population. Except for landlords, merchants, and children under the age of sixteen, only 3,087 adults have not joined the cooperative. Membership development has basically approached the saturation point. The democratic system of the cooperative is relatively sound, and there has been great development in business.

    In this year's spring plowing and production campaign, local farmers urgently demanded to be organized. Currently, four agricultural production cooperatives and 411 mutual aid groups have been formed, including 2,665 households, 14,278 people, 38,012 mu of land, 4,875 laborers, 1,007 livestock, and 704 carts. Approximately 50% of the land, labor, and livestock are organized.

    This area is a cotton-producing area. Last year, 31,500 mu of cotton were planted, with a yield of approximately 5.6 million jin. At that time, the task of purchasing cotton was quite heavy. Farmers rushed to sell cotton, and the cooperative was too busy to handle it, resulting in crowding, queuing, and competition for sales. Members requested improvements in the cotton purchasing methods and reflected: "We have no objection to the grading and weighing when selling cotton. We completely trust the cooperative, but we cannot delay our work." Therefore, under the call of party and government organs and the cooperative, and the urgent demands of the masses, a method of collective cotton sales was created.

    Collective cotton sales are carried out by village (with mutual aid groups within the village as the unit). The target is concentrated, and the procedures are simple. When collective cotton sales were first advocated, some people were not accustomed to it. The cooperative educated the masses and explained the benefits of collective cotton sales through detailed calculations, pointing out that villages with collective cotton sales have priority in selling cotton and do not need to queue or wait. When selling cotton collectively, only a few representatives need to be sent, and the cotton is also transported collectively, which can save a lot of manpower and resources. Persuading the masses with practical benefits is the key to carrying out this work.

    The cooperative set up eight cotton purchasing points according to the distance of each village, each including four to six villages. Each cotton purchasing point and its affiliated villages are arranged in order and rotated regularly for purchasing. There are 28 regular cotton purchasing personnel, divided into four groups, with an average of seven people per group. The weighing is the responsibility of the market management committee trader (collecting transaction tax). Everyone has a specific division of labor and clear responsibilities, which can reduce malpractices. The leaders of the mutual aid groups in each village register the amount of cotton sold by each household in advance and contact the cotton purchasing point. Each household ties a tag on their cotton bales, indicating the group, name, and quantity. The cotton sales representatives notify each household to gather the cotton on a regular basis and organize carts for collective transportation. The representatives sell the cotton, and the accounts are settled and payments made to each household based on the tags. The cotton sales representatives, transporters, carts, and livestock are all evaluated and recorded for work points based on the length of time spent, by the小组.

    According to incomplete statistics, by the end of February this year, there were 153 mutual aid groups that collectively sold cotton, accounting for 70% of the 218 mutual aid groups at that time. In ten villages, the mutual aid groups that implemented collective cotton sales accounted for 80%; of which four villages used the village as a unit and combined all mutual aid groups for collective cotton sales.

    There are many benefits to collective cotton sales:

    (1) Farmers save a lot of labor. For example, in Henggu Village, the first time 82 households collectively sold cotton, amounting to 32,800 jin. Nine representatives and thirty carts were sent. Each cart's animal power and the artificial labor of the driver were counted as one work point. Calculated at 30%, it totaled 18 work points. If each household had gone to sell individually, averaging 400 jin per household, it would have required two work points, totaling 164 work points for the entire village. This saved 146 work points. The second time, thirteen groups, or thirty-two households, collectively sold cotton, amounting to 15,000 jin. Six representatives and sixteen carts were sent. Representatives were calculated at 50% and carts at 30%, totaling only 6.8 work points, saving 57 work points compared to each household selling cotton individually. The third time, 44 groups, or 325 households, collectively sold cotton, amounting to 37,500 jin. Forty-four representatives were sent, calculated at 40%, and 35 carts were sent, calculated at 30%, totaling 28.1 work points, saving 291 work points compared to selling cotton individually. The above three times saved more than 400 work points. Moreover, each household selling cotton individually would have to queue up and wait longer.

    (2) The cooperative overfulfilled its task. The county cooperative assigned the cooperative a cotton purchasing task of 3.9 million jin, but it actually purchased 5.5 million jin, completing 141.3% of the task. The cotton purchasing task was completed quickly. For example, when the new cotton was launched last year, the masses still had a large amount of stored cotton to sell. This year, by the end of March, the cotton was basically collected.

    (3) Improved work efficiency and saved cadre manpower. In individual sales, the quantity is small, the number of times is high, and the procedures are complicated. After collective sales, the quantity increased, and the number of times decreased. This is mainly reflected in: (1) Strengthening the planning of cotton purchasing. How much cotton to purchase each day is agreed upon in advance with each village. With the amount of cotton to be purchased each day, the cooperative can prepare in advance for cadre deployment and warehousing management, avoiding crowding during busy times and waiting idly during slack times. (2) The number of grading and weighing times has been reduced. In the past, every household selling three or five jin of cotton had to have it graded and weighed once. Now, with the same procedure, the quantity is much larger. (3) Payment and accounting procedures have also been centralized. In the past, each person and each transaction had to be recorded in an account and paid once. Now, payments and accounts are made only once per group or village. For example, in the four months from October last year to January this year, 28 cadres collected a total of 4.87 million jin of cotton, averaging 1,450 jin of cotton collected per person per day. Compared to January of last year, when each person collected 450 jin of cotton per day, work efficiency increased by more than two times.

    (4) Stimulated wealthy households to sell cotton early. When purchasing cotton last year, some wealthy households often hid their cotton and waited for higher prices to sell it. Some farmers were afraid of showing their wealth and being asked to borrow, so they were unwilling to sell cotton. For example, member Dong Zhenqing hid more than 200 jin of cotton in a relative's home last year and was unwilling to sell it. This year, he participated in collective cotton sales and sold it all at once. When each group conducts collective cotton sales, they register the amount of cotton sold by each household in advance, encourage and supervise each other, which is a great education for wealthy households. They all recognize the glory of collective cotton sales. At the same time, through mutual comparison, everyone automatically dries and cleans the cotton, improving its quality.

    (5) Collective cotton sales are closely coordinated with supply operations. The cooperative prepared a large amount of production and living materials at each cotton purchasing point, which not only met the needs of the members but also expanded the cooperative's trade and recovered a large amount of currency. According to statistics, the sales volume of each cotton purchasing point from the end of February to March 25th reached 1.17 billion yuan. Members reflected: "We don't have to leave the village, the cotton is sold, and the things we need are bought back. The cooperative is really doing things for us."

    (6) Collective cotton sales have laid a favorable foundation for this year's cotton pre-purchase. Last year, cotton pre-purchase was contracted on a household basis. There were too many members, and it was impossible to monitor the implementation of the contract. The prepayment of deposits was also distributed equally. This year, it was decided to sign pre-purchase contracts with mutual aid groups in all cases. In places without mutual aid groups, contracts are signed with member groups. Therefore, on the basis of collective cotton sales, the preparation work for pre-purchase was quickly completed. This year, the area plans to plant 26,700 mu of cotton, with an estimated yield of approximately 5.34 million jin. The county cooperative assigned a pre-purchase task of 2.23 million jin, accounting for 41% of the yield. After the investigation and statistics of each group, under the principle of mass voluntary participation, the pre-purchase quantity increased to 2.8 million jin, accounting for 52% of the estimated yield. The cooperative issued pre-purchase certificates to each cotton-selling household, which will give them priority when selling cotton in the future.

    The main shortcomings in carrying out this work are the lack of contracts and planning. Therefore, it is necessary to establish binding contracts in the future to fix the responsibilities of the cooperative and the mutual aid groups, so that both parties have plans and ensure compliance and implementation.

    A few experiences:

    1. Supply and marketing cooperatives must establish the correct ideology of serving production through trade, solving the production and living difficulties of farmers, and overcoming the capitalist business ideology of "doing more when there is profit and doing less when there is no profit." At the same time, farmers should also be educated not to have excessive demands for "cheaper supplies and higher prices for sales."

    2. Whether it is collective sales, collective supply, or the signing of binding contracts, it is necessary to strictly prevent coercion and commandism. Propaganda and mobilization work must be done in advance, and the collective habits of the masses must be educated and cultivated through the actual actions of mastering reasonable prices and meeting the needs of members. The secretary of the Communist Party branch of Gao Xiandian Village led the mutual aid groups in the whole village to repeatedly study the People's Daily editorial "Promote the ‘Binding Contract’ of Mutual Aid Groups and Cooperatives" and the document on the binding contract between the Jilin Erdaogou Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the mutual aid groups, which improved the masses' understanding of the binding contract. This is a good experience.

    3. The signing of binding contracts should proceed steadily. First, find mutual aid groups with a better foundation, conduct typical demonstrations, gain experience, and then gradually promote them. If the conditions are not ripe, the random signing of contracts will inevitably lead to failure and create a bad influence on the masses. That is to say, when a contract is signed, it must be guaranteed to be fulfilled.

    4. The signing of binding contracts should focus on the main and large commodities. It is difficult to guarantee the implementation of the contract if contracts are signed for everything from the beginning. At the same time, binding contracts should be closely linked to production and promote production. The cooperative should not sign blind binding contracts based on the blind production plans of the mutual aid groups.

    The experience of collective cotton sales in the Wanglanzhuang joint village cooperative proves that the combination of mutual aid groups and cooperatives is the basic link for rural trade to move towards collectivization. We must grasp this link to meet the new situation after the organization of rural areas. In fact, the scattered and piecemeal business methods of cooperatives in the past can no longer meet the requirements of farmers. That is to say, the business operation methods of cooperatives in the past must be improved with the improvement of rural production methods. The signing of binding contracts between mutual aid groups and supply and marketing cooperatives is an important key to promoting the rational division of labor between production and supply and marketing and moving towards planning. We must promote this in a planned way. This is our new direction for future development and our goal for struggle.

    河北省丰南县王兰庄供销合作社与互助组相结合集体收售棉花的调查报告
    华北供销合作总社
    丰南县王兰庄供销合作社是以集镇为中心的联村社。社区包括四十二个村社，五、五○八户，三○、三六四人，土地八四、一五○亩。社员一五、八三七人，占当地总人口百分之五十二。除地主、商人及十六岁以下的儿童外，只有三、○八七个成人没有入社。社员发展基本上接近了饱和点。该社的民主制度比较健全，在业务上有了很大的发展。
    在今年春耕生产运动中，当地农民迫切要求组织起来，现已组成农业生产合作社四个，互助组四一一个，包括二、六六五户，一四、二七八人，土地三八、○一二亩，劳动力四、八七五人，牲畜一、○○七头，大车七○四辆。土地、劳力和牲畜约近百分之五十都组织起来了。
    这个地区是产棉区，去年植棉三一、五○○亩，产量约五六○万斤。当时收棉任务相当繁重，农民争先售棉，合作社忙不过来，形成拥挤、排队、争售现象。社员要求改善收棉办法，并反映：“我们卖棉花，验级、过秤都无意见，完全相信合作社，但是我们不能耽误工夫”。因此，在党政机关与合作社的号召和群众迫切要求之下，创造了集体售棉的办法。
    以村庄为单位（村内仍以互助组为单位）集体售棉，对象集中，手续简便。开始号召集体售棉，有些群众很不习惯。合作社向群众进行教育，用算细账的办法，说明集体售棉的村庄，售棉时有优先权，不用排队、不用等待；集体售棉时，只推派几个代表就行了，棉花也集体运送，可以节省很多人力、物力。用实际利益说服群众，这是开展这一工作的重要关键。
    该社按照各村距离远近，设立了八个收棉点，每个收棉点包括四至六个村庄，各收棉点及所辖村庄都排列次序，定期轮流收购。经常收棉人员二十八人，分为四组，平均每组七人。过秤由集市管理委员会交易员负责（收交易税）。大家分工具体，职责分明，可以减少流弊。各村的互助组长事先登记各户售棉数量，和收棉点联系好；各户的棉花包上，自行拴牌子，注明组别、姓名、数量；售棉代表通知各户，定期将棉花集中，组织大车集体装运。代表售出棉花，凭牌子和各户算账付款。售棉代表、运送人员、大车和牲畜，都按时间长短，由小组评议记工。
    据不完整统计，到今年二月底止，集体售棉的互助组有一五三个，占当时二一八个互助组的百分之七十。十个村庄实行集体售棉的互助组占百分之八十；其中有四个村是以村为单位，结合全部互助组进行集体售棉的。
    集体售棉的好处是很多的：
    （一）农民节省了很多劳动力。如横沽村第一次集体售棉八二户，三二、八○○斤，去代表九人，大车三十辆，每辆车的畜力和赶车的人工共算一个工，按三成计算，共十八个工；如每户单独去卖，平均每户卖四百斤，得要两个工，全村共需一六四个工；这样就节省了一四六个工。第二次集体售棉者十三个组，三十二户，集体售棉一五、○○○斤，去代表六人，大车十六辆，代表按五成、大车按三成计工，只用六点八个工，比各户单独卖棉节省五十七个工。第三次集体卖棉者共四十四组，三二五户，售棉三七、五○○斤，去代表四十四人，按四成计工，大车三五辆，按三成计工，共用二十八点一个工，比单独卖棉节省二九一个工。以上三次就节省四百多个工。而每户单独售棉，要挨号排队，需时更长。
    （二）合作社超额完成了任务。县社布置该社收棉三九○万斤，实际收棉五五○万斤，完成任务百分之一四一点三。收棉任务很快的完成了。如去年新花上市时，群众还有大批存棉来卖；今年到三月底，基本上收完了棉花。
    （三）提高了工作效率，节省了干部力量。个别售棉时，数量少，次数多，手续繁杂。集体售棉后，数量增加了，次数减少了。这主要表现在：（1）加强了收棉的计划性。每天收棉多少，事先都与各村联系好了。有了每天收购的数量，合作社对于干部调配，仓储保管，都可预为准备，避免了忙时拥挤不堪，闲时挂秤坐等的现象。（2）验级、过秤次数减少了。以前每户卖三斤五斤，要验一次级，过一次秤；现在同样一道手续，数量就大多了。（3）付款记账手续也集中了。过去每人每笔要记一次账，付一次款，现在以组或以村为单位，付一次款记一次账就行了。如去年十月到今年一月的四个月中，二十八个干部共收棉四八七万斤，平均每人每天收棉一、四五○斤，和去年一月份每人每天收棉四五○斤比较，提高工作效率两倍以上。
    （四）刺激了富裕户提前售棉。去年收棉时，有些富裕户往往把棉花藏起来，等价惜售；有些农民则怕露富、怕人借，不愿卖棉。如社员董振清去年把二百多斤棉花，藏在亲戚家里，不愿出售；今年参加集体售棉，一次就卖完了。各组在集体售棉时，事先登记各户售棉数量，相互动员、相互监督，这对富裕户是个很大的教育，他们都认识了集体售棉光荣的道理。同时，在相互比较之下，大家都自动地把棉花晒干检净，提高了品质。
    （五）集体售棉和供应业务密切配合起来。该社在各收棉点准备了大批生产、生活资料，不但满足了社员需要，而且扩大了合作社贸易，回笼了大批货币。据统计，各收棉点从二月底到三月二十五日，销货额达十一亿七千多万元。社员反映：“咱们人不出村，棉花也卖了，需要的东西也买回来了，合作社真为咱办事。”
    （六）集体售棉为今年预购棉花打下了有利的基础。去年预购棉花是按户订立合同，社员人数太多，无法掌握执行合同情况，预付定金也是平均分配。今年决定一律与互助组订立预购合同，没有互助组的地方，则与社员小组订立合同，因此，在集体售棉的基础上，很快地完成了预购的准备工作。今年该地计划植棉二六、七○○亩，估计产量约五三四万斤，县社布置预购二二三万斤，占产量的百分之四十一。经过各小组的调查统计，在群众自愿原则下，预购数量增到二八○万斤，占预产量的百分之五十二。合作社发给各售棉户预购证明，将来他们售棉时享有优先权。
    在开展这工作中，最主要的缺点是没有订立合同，并且缺乏计划性。因此，今后必须订立结合合同，把合作社和互助组的责任固定起来，使双方都有了计划，并保证遵守执行。
    几点体验：
    一、供销社必须树立贸易为生产服务的正确思想，为农民解决生产上和生活上的困难，克服“有利多做，无利少为”的资本主义经营思想。同时也要教育农民，不要存有“供应要便宜、推销要大价”的过分要求。
    二、不论集体推销、集体供应或订立结合合同，要严防强迫命令。事先要作好宣传动员工作，并从掌握合理价格及满足社员需要的实际行动中，来教育和培养群众的集体习惯。高先甸村中共支部书记领导全村互助组，再三学习人民日报“推广互助组和合作社的‘结合合同’”社论及吉林二道沟供销合作社与互助组结合合同的文件，提高了群众对结合合同的认识，这是很好的经验。
    三、订立结合合同要稳步前进，先找基础较好的互助组，进行典型示范，取得经验，再慢慢推广。如果条件不成熟就乱订合同，必然遭到失败，给群众造成不良的影响。这就是说，订一个合同就要保证实现一个合同。
    四、订立结合合同，应以主要的大宗的商品为主，不能一开始就样样都订合同，这样是很难保证合同实现的。同时，结合合同要密切地联系生产，推动生产，合作社不能根据互助组盲目的生产计划，订立盲目的结合合同。
    王兰庄联村社集体售棉的经验，证明了互助组与合作社结合起来，是农村贸易走向集体化的基本环节。我们必须掌握这一环节，来迎接农村组织起来以后新的形势。事实上，过去合作社的分散的、零星的经营方式，已经不能满足农民的要求了。这就是说，过去合作社的业务经营方式，必须随着农村生产方式的提高而提高。互助组与供销合作社订立结合合同，是促进生产与供销合理分工和走上计划性的重要关键，我们必须有计划地加以推广。这是我们今后发展的新方向，也是我们奋斗的目标。
