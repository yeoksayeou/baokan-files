    Employees of the Jiang Engine Depot Water Supply Station
    Strive to Create a Record of One Thousand Days Without Accidents
    Comrade Editor: The workers of the Zhenjiang Engine Depot Water Supply Station have gloriously completed the task of seven hundred and forty days without accidents. To celebrate the "May Day" Labor Day, they are working hard to create a record of one thousand days without accidents.
    The water supply task undertaken by the station is very important. All trains arriving and departing must stop here to replenish their water supply. The daily water consumption is more than 4,000 tons. If the workers are negligent in their work and stop the water supply, it will affect the entire transportation system. They all recognize the harm this would cause to the country, and are determined to ensure long-term elimination of accidents and strive for safe transportation. During the "Three-Anti" movement, they did not slacken production, strictly implemented the handover and inspection system, and organized voluntary patrol teams at night to prevent sabotage by criminals. Once, they found many large stone culverts at the bottom of the west pool, blocking the water flow. This prevented the water from being quickly transported to the storage tower and then to the water supply pipe. In order to ensure the on-time departure of trains, all the workers worked day and night, and dug out thirteen stone culverts within a week, clearing the water flow obstacles. They also removed more than one hundred tons of weeds from the water, cleaning the water quality. This kind of water sent to the locomotive boiler will extend the life of the boiler. Relying on their sense of responsibility for the people's railway undertaking, as of April 10, the station had achieved a victory of seven hundred and forty days without accidents.

    江机务给水所职工
    正为创造一千天无事故的纪录努力
    编辑同志：镇江机务给水所工人光荣完成了七百四十天无事故的任务。为了庆祝“五一”劳动节，他们正在努力创造一千天无事故的纪录。
    该所负担的给水任务非常重大，所有上下列车都要在这里停车补足水量。每天用水量在四千吨以上。如果工人一旦工作疏忽，停止水源，就要影响整个的运输。他们都认识了这对国家的危害性，坚决保证长期消灭事故，争取安全运输。在“三反”运动中，他们并没有放松生产，严格执行了交接检查制度，夜间组织了义务纠察队，防止不法分子破坏。有一次，他们发现西面水池底有很多大型石质的涵洞，堵塞了水流。这使水不能很快地输送到贮水塔，再送到送水管。为了争取列车正点开出，全体工人日夜工作，在一星期内共挖出石质涵洞十三只，扫除了水流障碍物。他们还清除了水中的野草一百多吨，洁净了水质。这种水送到机车锅炉里，将延长锅炉的寿命。依靠他们对人民铁道事业的负责精神，到四月十日止，该所已获得了七百四十天无事故的胜利。  邹楚君
