International Brief Review

The Bloody Hands of America's Germ Warfare are Firmly Grasped

    We have repeatedly presented irrefutable evidence of the American aggressors' crimes of conducting germ warfare. Now, the interrogation records and supplementary confessions of Enoch and Quinn, in addition to the facts they previously admitted in their confessions, broadcasts, and open letters, provide many more specific details and evidence. According to Enoch's confession, when the Third Bombardment Group of the Third Bombardment Wing of the US Fifth Air Force issued the order "Attention to non-explosive bombs (i.e., germ bombs)" on January 1st of this year, there were ninety people present. Quinn's interrogation records and supplementary confessions confess that at the meeting on December 31st of last year, all crew members piloting B-26 aircraft were instructed to report specifically on the details of dropping all "non-explosive bombs" upon returning from missions from that day forward. Quinn also confessed that the other four US Air Force personnel who shared a room with him had all carried out the heinous order to drop germ bombs.

    After the previous confessions of Enoch and Quinn were published, no American official or American lackey dared to criticize these ironclad facts. In his May 7th statement, Acheson had to admit that the facts listed in Enoch and Quinn's confessions were "so detailed," but he dared not touch these facts at all. Those American military and non-military personnel who were pointed out by Enoch and Quinn in their confessions as being responsible for teaching germ warfare courses and for carrying out germ warfare missions, with names, surnames, positions (some of whom were also described with their hair color, age, weight, and height), dared not speak. The interrogation records and supplementary confessions of Enoch and Quinn further point out that the bloody hands of America's crime of conducting germ warfare have been firmly grasped and can no longer be denied.

    The Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world have fully recognized the vicious conspiracy of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare and will certainly make these criminals receive the punishment they deserve before the forces of justice. The peace-loving people of the world must continue to work to accomplish this solemn task.

    国际简评
    美国进行细菌战的血手被牢牢地捉住了
    对于美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，我们已屡次提出了无可辩驳的罪证。现在，伊纳克和奎恩的讯问笔录和补充口供，除了与以前他们在供词、广播词、公开信中承认了的完全相同的事实部分之外，还提供了许多更为具体的情节和罪证。据伊纳克供认，仅美国第五航空队第三轰炸联队的第三轰炸大队在今年一月一日传达“注意不爆炸的炸弹（即细菌弹）”的命令时，就有九十人在场。奎恩的讯问笔录和补充口供中，供认了在去年十二月三十一日的传达命令的会议上，所有驾驶B—26型飞机的各组人员都被吩咐自即日起在执行任务归来汇报时应特别报告投掷一切“不爆炸的炸弹”的详情。奎恩并供认，在和他同住一个房间的其他四个美国空军人员都曾经执行过投掷细菌弹的罪恶命令。
    在伊纳克和奎恩前次的供词发表后，没有任何一个美国官员或美国的仆从们敢于对这种铁的事实有所非难。艾奇逊在五月七日的谈话中，曾经不得不承认伊纳克和奎恩的供词所列举的事实是“如此详尽”，可是他对这些事实连碰也不敢碰一下。那些被伊纳克和奎恩在供词中指出的负责讲授细菌战课程和负责执行细菌战任务的有名有姓有职衔（其中有的人且被指出了发色、年龄、体重和体高）的美国军事和非军事人员，更不敢作声。伊纳克和奎恩的讯问笔录和补充口供进一步指出，美国进行细菌战的罪恶的血手已被牢牢捉住，再也无法狡赖了。
    中朝人民和世界爱好和平人民已经完全认识了美国侵略者进行细菌战的恶毒的阴谋，将来一定要叫这批罪犯在正义力量的面前受到应得的惩罚。全世界爱好和平的人民必须继续为完成这个严肃的任务而努力。
