The full text of Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's speech:
Dear friends,

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference expresses its sincere welcome to all the representatives of the Burmese Cultural Delegation headed by Head of Delegation U Tun Pe. Your visit will not only strengthen the friendship and cultural exchange between China and Burma, but will also contribute to the cause of Asian peace and world peace.

China and Burma have long been like brotherly countries. In terms of culture, especially in music, drama, dance, painting, and sculpture, we have many things in common. This shows that we have a very long history of cultural exchange. We must cherish this historical relationship and expand it. In this sense, the recent exchange of cultural delegations between China and Burma is very meaningful. We hope that such mutual visits will continue in the future to make our brotherly friendship even closer.

Culture is an important achievement of peaceful construction, and cultural exchange is an important factor in promoting peaceful construction. A nation's culture most deeply expresses its life, emotions, and wisdom, and cultural exchange between nations can therefore enhance the deepest understanding and close unity between them. This will strengthen the forces for defending peace and promote the achievements of peaceful construction.

For the consolidation of Asian peace and world peace, for the strengthening of Sino-Burmese friendship and the prosperity of the two peoples, please allow me to raise this glass to wish you all good health.

The full text of Head of Delegation U Tun Pe's speech:
Mr. Vice Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Please allow me, on behalf of my colleagues, to express our sincere gratitude for the warm welcome you have extended here. Since we set foot on the soil of New China, we have received countless warm receptions, and I feel that my gratitude is far from enough. But I can assure you that the spirit of our gratitude far exceeds what our words express.

We are here to enhance and strengthen the cultural relations and consolidate our friendship between our two neighboring countries.

Since ancient times, China and Burma have had the closest cultural and friendly relations. In our history, there have been many exchanges of culture, customs, and ways of life. Our ancestors, the pioneers of friendly relations between the two countries, crossed the towering mountains separating the two countries for the sake of cultural and commercial relations between the two countries. These constant contacts have greatly enriched the culture of the two neighboring countries and promoted friendship between the two countries.

When the first cultural delegation representing the people of the People's Republic of China visited our country in December 1951, a new page was turned in the history of our two countries. In the past, cultural and friendly ties were mainly for the benefit of the ruling class and the business community, but now they are no longer for this narrow interest but are strengthened and consolidated on a broader basis of people to people. To reciprocate your cultural delegation's visit and to further strengthen cultural exchange and friendly relations, we have come to you. Our delegation is the first to formally represent the independent Union of Burma and its people to visit New China. Among us are members of parliament, representatives of ethnic minorities, and scholars representing the Burmese cultural community. We are here not only to restore existing relations, but also to study the economic and cultural progress made by New China in the short period of two years under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

Our delegation sincerely hopes that this visit to the People's Republic of China will forever exist in history as the most prominent milestone in consolidating the friendship between the two countries.

Once again, let me thank you for your warm welcome to us, and reiterate the Burmese people's greatest congratulations to the prosperous New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

(Xinhua News Agency, 3rd) The Burmese Cultural Delegation visited the Central Institute for Nationalities on the 3rd and visited the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government.

The delegation met with students from various ethnic minorities from all over China at the Central Institute for Nationalities and visited the "Exhibition of Cultural Relics and Pictures of Ethnic Minorities" held by the school to celebrate the "May 1st" International Labor Day.

In the afternoon of the same day, the delegation visited the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government and held a symposium on ethnic issues with the responsible comrades of the commission. The symposium was presided over by Li Weihan, Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission. Those attending the symposium included Liu Geping (Hui), Vice Chairman of the Commission, and committee members Zhu Zaoguan (Miao), Liu Chun (Han), Luo Changpei (Manchu), Jian Bozan (Uyghur), Sakongliao (Mongolian), Yang Jingren (Hui), Zhao Fan (Han), Aaisa (Uyghur), Deputy Director of the General Office, Peng Suke (Mongolian), Meng Teer (Tibetan), head of the Tibetan Affairs Group, and Luo Wang (Tibetan), acting director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing.

In the past two days, the delegation also visited the Beijing Film Studio and the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University. Some members of the delegation visited the Central Academy of Fine Arts. The delegation also visited the Temple of Heaven and the Yonghe Temple.

    缅甸文化代表团参观访问我民族学院和民族事务委员会
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在三日晚设宴招待以宇吞帕为首的缅甸文化代表团。
    出席宴会的有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席李济深、沈钧儒、陈叔通，常务委员王崑崙、章伯钧、黄炎培、章乃器、邓颖超、冯文彬、梁希、邵力子，委员：朱蕴山、余心清、蔡廷锴、罗隆基、周新民、许广平、许德珩、蓝公武、史良、李书城、梁漱溟、梅龚彬及中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副秘书长邢西萍。
    出席宴会的还有外交部副部长章汉夫，及各民主党派各人民团体代表王绍鏊、彭泽民、严希纯、林云、朱学范、何香凝、田德民以及我国驻缅甸大使馆参赞谢黎。
    缅甸驻华大使吴拉茂和大使馆外交人员也应邀参加宴会。
    席间，陈叔通副主席和宇吞帕团长相继致词。
    陈叔通副主席致辞全文各位亲爱的朋友：
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会对于以宇吞帕团长为首的缅甸文化代表团的各位代表表示诚恳的欢迎。你们的来访不仅会加强中缅两国的友谊和文化上的交流，而且对于亚洲和平与世界和平事业定有贡献。
    中国和缅甸很久以来就是兄弟一样的国家。在两国的文化方面，特别在音乐、戏曲、舞蹈、绘画、雕塑等方面，我们有很多共同的地方。这正表明我们在文化上的交流是有着很长远的历史的。我们要珍惜这种历史关系，并把它扩大起来。在这层意义上，最近期间，中缅两国有文化代表团交互聘问，是很有意义的事。我们希望今后要不断地举行这样的相互聘问，使我们的兄弟友谊更加亲密起来。
    文化是和平建设的重要成果，文化的交流是促进和平建设的重要因素。一个民族的文化最深切地表现着一个民族的生活、感情和智慧，民族与民族之间的文化交流因而便可以增进彼此之间的最深切的了解和亲密的团结。这样便能够加强保卫和平的力量，而促进和平建设的成就。
    为了亚洲和平与世界和平的巩固，为了中缅友谊的加强和两国人民的繁荣，请允许我举这杯酒祝各位健康。
    宇吞帕团长致辞全文副主席、各位女士、先生：
    请允许我代表我的同事们向你们这里的热烈欢迎表示诚恳的谢意。自从我们踏上新中国的国土之后，受到无数热诚的招待，我觉得我的谢意是很不够的。但是我可以向你们保证，我们的谢意的精神是远超过我们的话所表示的。
    我们来此是为了增进、加强我们两个邻国之间的文化关系和巩固我们的友谊。
    很古以来中缅一直有着最亲密的文化和友谊关系。在我们的历史上有着许多文化和风俗习惯及生活方式的交流。我们的祖先，即两国友谊关系的先驱者，曾为了两国的文化和商业关系而越过了隔离两者的大山峻岭。这些不断的接触曾大大地丰富了两个邻国的文化并促进了两者的友谊。
    当新中国的第一个代表中华人民共和国人民的文化代表团，在一九五一年十二月访问我国的时候，在我们两国的历史上展开了新的一页。过去的文化和友谊的联系主要是为了统治阶级和商业界的利益，现在则不再是为了这狭窄的利益而是在更广阔的人民与人民的基础上加强与巩固起来了。为了回拜你们文化代表团的访问，同时为了进一步加强文化交流和友谊关系，我们来到了你们这里。我们的代表团是第一个正式代表独立的缅甸联邦及其人民来访问新中国的。在我们中间，有国会议员，少数民族代表和代表缅甸文化界的学者们。我们在此不但要恢复已有的关系，而且也要来研究新中国短短两年来在毛主席领导下在经济、文化上的进步。    
    我们代表团诚恳地希望，此次来中华人民共和国的访问将永远存在历史上，作为巩固两国友谊的最突出的里程碑。
    再一次，让我向你们对我们的热诚欢迎致谢，并重复缅甸联邦人民对毛主席领导下的繁荣的新中国致以最大的祝贺。
    【新华社三日讯】缅甸文化代表团于三日参观中央民族学院，并访问中央人民政府民族事务委员会。
    代表团在中央民族学院会见了来自中国各地的少数民族学生，并参观了该校为庆祝“五一”国际劳动节而举办的“少数民族文物图片展览”。
    当日下午，代表团访问中央人民政府民族事务委员会，并与该会负责同志举行关于民族问题的座谈会。座谈会由民族事务委员会主任委员李维汉主持。参加座谈会的有该会副主任委员刘格平（回），委员朱早观（苗）、刘春（汉）、罗常培（满）、翦伯赞（维吾尔）、萨空了（蒙）、杨静仁（回）、赵范（汉），办公厅副主任阿艾沙（维吾尔）、朋斯克（蒙），藏族事务组长孟特尔（藏）以及班禅驻京办事处代理处长罗旺（藏）。
