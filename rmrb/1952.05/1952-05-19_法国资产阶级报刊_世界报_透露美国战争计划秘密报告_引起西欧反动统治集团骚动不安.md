    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" of Paris disclosed on May 9th a top-secret report by U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Fechteler to the National Security Council, the highest decision-making body of the United States, on January 18th this year, regarding the U.S. war plan in Europe and the Mediterranean. As the United Press stated: the disclosure of this report "has caused serious unrest throughout Western Europe."

    Fechteler's report paints a bleak picture for the ruling groups of Western European countries who are trying their best to follow the U.S. in expanding armaments and preparing for war. According to Fechteler: "War is bound to break out before 1960," and "the armies that the Allies plan to establish before the end of 1952 (referring to the European aggressive forces) can be defeated by Russia within three days." The Russian air force will be able to occupy the airports of Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France on the fourth day after the outbreak of the war, and "atomic bombing will make Britain lose its role as a base." Therefore, "the current defense (should be read as aggression) preparations in Western Europe are only of theoretical value." Based on this inference, Fechteler believes that the United States should regard the Mediterranean region as the most important strategic stronghold, because in his view, "whoever can hold Gibraltar, Suez, and the Dardanelles will win." Thus, Fechteler believes that the United States must maintain absolute control over the Mediterranean region, which occupies such an important position in its war plan, and must squeeze out the power of its British and French partners from this region.

    There is no doubt that the publication of the Fechteler report has dampened the European Army plan currently being heavily promoted by the United States, and the U.S. government cannot help but fall into an extremely embarrassing situation because of this. Therefore, from Fechteler himself to the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, U.S. President Truman, and other relevant figures and departments, they hurriedly came out to deny the existence of this report. However, this trick of trying to cover up the truth will certainly not be of any use. "Le Monde" flatly refuted these denials and affirmed the absolute authenticity of the report. As the United Press admitted, no matter what, this incident "will undoubtedly cause great damage to U.S. foreign policy."

    Facts have proved that the disclosure of the Fechteler report has deepened the suspicion and fear of the Western European vassal states towards U.S. policy. The British "News Chronicle" admitted that the prospect of Western European countries suffering devastating blows first after the United States launches a war of aggression has further heightened the "unease" that has been felt on the European continent for several years. The French bourgeois "Combat" newspaper clearly published an editorial on the 10th entitled "A Report That Reveals the Truth," complaining that the sacrifices made by the U.S. "requiring the European economy for everything done to fight for three days is only to allow European countries to be conquered." The newspaper believes that a country's acceptance of the U.S. war alliance is "equivalent to suicide."

    Moreover, the publication of the Fechteler report also marks the further intensification of the struggle between the United States and its main partner Britain for hegemony in the Mediterranean. "Le Monde" pointed out: The Fechteler report just illustrates the reason for the continued dispute between the United States and Britain over the command of the Mediterranean. Just a few days before the Fechteler report was leaked, Fechteler himself went to London to consult with senior British officials, attempting to finally force Britain to agree to appoint a U.S. general as the commander of the North Atlantic Group's Mediterranean Navy, but Britain firmly rejected the U.S. request, leaving the 18-month dispute over the Mediterranean command in a stalemate. Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th dispatch: After the Fechteler report was disclosed, "the very serious differences between the U.S. and Britain on the issue of command of the Mediterranean have reached the point of becoming an international dispute."

    Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th dispatch, said that the huge wave caused by the Fechteler report in Western Europe is still developing. The dispatch quoted the "Observer's" commentary pointing out that the impact of the Fechteler report's disclosure is: "Encouraging neutrality; undermining European morale; and creating rifts between the countries of the Atlantic Group at a time when harmony must be maintained in order for European parliaments to pass important resolutions—especially contractual agreements with Germany and the European Army plan."

    法国资产阶级报刊“世界报”
    透露美国战争计划秘密报告
    引起西欧反动统治集团骚动不安
    【新华社十七日讯】法国资产阶级的巴黎“世界报”在五月九日披露了美国海军作战部长费泰勒今年一月十八日向作为美国最高决策机关的国家安全委员会提出的关于美国在欧洲和地中海的战争计划的绝密报告。如合众社所称：这个报告的泄露“已引起整个西欧的严重骚动”。
    费泰勒的报告，画出了西欧各国统治集团竭力追随美国扩军备战的惨淡远景。据费泰勒看来：“战争不可避免地要在一九六○年以前爆发”，而“盟国计划在一九五二年年底以前建立的军队（按指欧洲侵略军），可以在三天之内被俄国击溃”。俄国空军能够在战争爆发后的第四天占领丹麦、荷兰、比利时和法国的机场，而“原子弹的轰炸将使英国失去作为基地的作用”。因此，“现在西欧进行的防务（应读作侵略）准备只有理论上的价值”。根据这种推断，费泰勒认为美国应该把地中海地区当作最重要的战略据点，因为在他看来，“谁能够守住直布罗陀、苏彝士和达达尼尔海峡，谁就能获胜”。这样，费泰勒认为，美国对于在它的战争计划中占有如此重要地位的地中海区域必须保有绝对的控制，必须把英法伙伴的势力从这个地区中排挤出去。
    毫无疑问，费泰勒报告之发表是使美国目前正大事鼓吹的欧洲军计划泄了气，美国政府不能不因此而陷入极度狼狈的境地。因此，从费泰勒本人到美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷和美国总统杜鲁门以及其他有关人物和部门都慌忙出来否认有这个报告。但是，这种欲盖弥彰的伎俩当然不会有什么用处。“世界报”断然驳斥了这些否认，并申明报告的绝对真实性。如合众社所承认，不论怎样，这件事“无疑会对美国外交政策造成很大的损害”。
    事实证明，费泰勒报告之泄露已经加深了西欧附庸国家对于美国政策的怀疑与恐惧。英国“新闻纪事报”承认，美国发动侵略战争后西欧国家首先要遭受毁灭性的打击的前景，使几年来欧洲大陆上“梦寐不安”的情绪进一步高涨。法国资产阶级的“战斗报”在十日明白以“一个泄露真相的报告”为题发表社论，抱怨美国“要求欧洲经济为打三天仗所作的一切牺牲只不过是使欧洲各国被人征服而已”。该报认为，一个国家接受了美国的战争联盟就“等于自杀”。
    不仅如此，费泰勒报告之发表还标志着美国及其主要伙伴英国之间关于地中海霸权的争夺的进一步尖锐化。“世界报”指出：费泰勒报告正好说明了美英两国在地中海指挥权问题上争持不下的原因。就在费泰勒报告泄露的前几天，费泰勒本人曾亲自到伦敦与英国高级官员会商，企图最后迫使英国同意任命美国将领为北大西洋集团地中海海军司令，但是英国坚决拒绝了美国的要求，使争执达十八个月之久的地中海指挥权问题继续陷于僵局。法新社巴黎十日电说：费泰勒报告披露后，“美英之间在地中海指挥权问题上的非常严重的分歧已经到了成为国际争端的地步”。
    法新社巴黎十四日电说，费泰勒报告在西欧引起的巨大波动仍在发展。该电引用“观察家”的评论指出，费泰勒报告的泄露所造成的影响是：“鼓励中立；败坏欧洲的士气；在为了使欧洲的议会通过重要决议——特别是与德国的契约性协定及欧洲军计划而必需保持和谐的时候，使大西洋集团各国产生裂痕”。
