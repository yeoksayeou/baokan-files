Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill Reading Group
Holds Forum to Discuss Production Competition

Editor Comrade: The "May First" International Labor Day is coming. On this day, we workers feel particularly happy. In order to welcome this great festival, our mill's reading group recently held a forum to discuss the issue of launching a May competition. The roving frame workshop reading group proposed restoring the Hao Jianxiu Work Method to greet the "May First" Festival (they used the Hao Jianxiu Work Method last year, which significantly reduced the waste wool rate, but because the administration did not establish the necessary inspection and reward system for this work method, it was abandoned shortly after implementation), and to launch a red flag competition to reduce the waste wool rate. The workers in the spinning workshop started a red flag competition for cleanliness and sanitation in April. This competition aims to keep the workshop, machines, and individuals clean at all times, in order to reduce the waste wool rate and waste yarn rate, and at the same time improve product quality. According to recent statistics for a week, the waste wool rate of 45-count yarn spun from Australian wool has been reduced by 83 percent compared to the past, that is, from 3.64 liang of waste wool per machine per day to 0.63 liang; the waste wool rate of 30-count yarn spun from domestic wool has been reduced by 69 percent, that is, from 12.85 liang of waste wool per machine per day to 3.99 liang. They plan to reduce the waste wool and waste yarn rates to the lowest limit in May and strive for every machine to get a red flag. Other examples include the workers in the finishing and dyeing department having increased their work efficiency from repairing 11 pieces of woolen cloth per day in the past to 20 pieces; the combing group has been able to comb more than 1,300 jin of wool per day recently due to improvements in the method of wiping the machines.

At this reading group forum, almost everyone put forward rationalization proposals for improving their work: Comrade Wang Longmei of the roving frame workshop proposed using the doffing time to wipe the machines, which can increase the production time of the machines by 50 minutes per day. In order to reduce waste, Comrade Lin Huizhu of the drying department proposed strengthening the planning of work to avoid repeated baking and waste of heating and wind power; Gao Peihua and Lu Ruilin of the spinning workshop both proposed using damaged steel travellers.

This year's "May First" Festival is more exciting for us workers than in previous years. In the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, our working class repelled the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, and new atmospheres have appeared everywhere. Our production has increased, and our lives have also improved. This year, we have new dormitories, and many people have bought watches, bicycles, leather shoes, etc.; nurseries have also been set up, and mothers are very happy about this! In terms of learning, in addition to the fixed cultural and political studies every day, we have recently opened intermediate technical classes, and everyone is very enthusiastic about learning and has good results. We believe that by the time of next year's "May First" Festival, the country's economic construction will be more developed than it is today, and the lives of the workers will be better than they are today!

    举行座谈会讨论生产竞赛
    编辑同志：“五一”国际劳动节来到了。每逢这一天，我们工人的心里就感到特别高兴。为了迎接这个伟大的节日，我们全厂读报组在最近举行了一次座谈会，商量开展五月竞赛的问题。粗纱车间读报组提出以恢复郝建秀工作法来迎接“五一”节（他们在去年运用郝建秀工作法，曾使回毛率显著减少，但由于行政上对这一工作法没有建立必要的检查制度和奖励制度，所以实行不久就放弃了），并开展红旗竞赛降低回毛率。细纱车间的工人从四月份起就开始了清洁卫生红旗竞赛，这一竞赛是要使工房、机器和个人能经常地保持清洁，以达到减少回毛率、回纱率，同时提高产品质量的目的。根据近来一个星期的统计，纺澳洲毛四十五支纱的回毛率已较前降低百分之八十三，就是从每台车每天回毛三·六四两降低到零·六三两；纺国产毛三十支纱的回毛率降低百分之六十九，就是从每台车每天回毛十二·八五两降低到三·九九两。他们准备在五月里把回毛、回纱率降到最低限度，争取每台车都能得到红旗。其他如整染部工人的工作效率已由过去每天修补十一匹毛呢，提高到二十匹；梳毛组在最近由于改进了擦车方法，每天能多梳毛一千三百多斤。
    在这次读报组的座谈会上，几乎每一个人都提出了改进工作的合理化建议：粗纱车间的王龙妹同志提出了利用下纱时间擦车的建议，这可以使机器每天增加五十分钟的生产时间。为减少浪费，烘呢部的林蕙珠同志提出要加强工作的计划性，避免重复烘烤浪费暖气和风力的现象；细纱车间的高培华、卢瑞林都提出了利用坏钢丝圈的办法。
    今年的“五一”节，我们工人比往年更加兴奋。我们工人阶级在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动中，打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，到处都出现了新的气象。我们的生产提高了，生活也跟着好起来。今年，我们有了新的宿舍，许多人买了手表、自行车、皮鞋等等；托儿所也办起来了，母亲们为这件事可高兴呢！在学习方面，我们除了每天有固定的文化和政治学习以外，最近又开办了中等技术班，大家学习的热情很高，成绩也好。我们相信：明年“五一”节的时候，国家的经济建设将比今天更加发展，工人生活将比今天更美好！
