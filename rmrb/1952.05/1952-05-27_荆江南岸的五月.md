May on the South Bank of Jingjiang

On the Jingjiang flood diversion project site on the south bank of the Jingjiang River, thousands of workers, military personnel, and civilian laborers are engaged in an unprecedented and intense struggle. The floodwaters, arriving earlier than in previous years, are now steadily approaching the Jingjiang flood diversion construction site. The water level at Taipingkou has risen to thirty-eight meters, five meters higher than the lowest level since construction began. In another month and a half, the major flood season of the Yangtze River will arrive. Currently, at the Taipingkou flood inlet gate construction site of the Jingjiang flood diversion project, tens of thousands of technicians, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and farmers are working tirelessly against the clock to compete with the floodwaters. The roar of concrete mixers, water pumps, cranes, and various power machinery is incessant. At night, thousands of electric lights and searchlights illuminate half the sky. All construction sites of the Jingjiang flood diversion project have entered a stage of intensive construction.

Both the Taipingkou flood inlet gate and the Huangshantou control gate are pouring concrete, a challenging task in this red May. To gain time, the construction of the entire fifty-four-hole base and upstream anti-sliding plate of the Taipingkou flood inlet gate is being tackled with full force, using crisscrossing and overlapping methods from clearing the foundation, surveying, setting up formwork to binding steel bars and pouring concrete. Technical workers, steelworkers, soldiers, and carpenters all guarantee: "Wherever the first step of the project reaches, the second step will follow." Everyone understands the great significance of their labor to the country's construction and the people's well-being. They strive to ensure that their work can keep pace with the progress of the entire project. The steel bar straightening team led by technician Yu Xiangyuan from Changsha has increased its daily output from thirty bars per group to sixty, eighty, and even a maximum of one hundred and twenty. Technicians Chen Zhonghua and Zhang Xiaoan from the steel bar bending team have devised a method of using a mold instead of pliers to bend round steel bars, which is not only twice as fast but also improves quality. Previously, the work of the steel bar team, the carpentry team, and the concrete team was sometimes faster, sometimes slower, pushing and pulling each other, and the coordination was poor; now they are motivating each other, and work efficiency has improved.

Many of the people building the Taipingkou flood inlet gate have never seen such modern water conservancy buildings; even for construction workers from Wuhan and Shanghai, the highly technical work of binding steel frames for the gate piers is a first-time experience. However, they have learned skills and mastered techniques in the midst of intense labor. Military personnel have also learned how to adjust the water-cement ratio in concrete mixing. Soldiers pushing carts run back and forth on narrow planks less than a foot wide. They have all learned several sets of skills in a short period. A young squad leader named Guo Ni stays at the construction site after others have finished their shifts to participate in the next shift's work; whenever he has free time, he asks the engineers questions and observes the workers. In this way, he mastered all the techniques of earthwork in two days and three nights.

It is now the rainy season in southern China, and it rains every two or three days. Each time the wind and rain come, people's clothes get wet, and the dust blows into their eyes, but it cannot extinguish or blow away everyone's enthusiasm for work. On May 22nd and 23rd, it rained incessantly all day, and workers, soldiers, and civilian laborers worked in the rain. The civilian laborers of the Third Company of the Third Brigade of Zhijiang County completed their daily earthwork projects the same in rainy weather as in sunny weather, and won the "Hero" red flag as the first model unit.

On every construction site on the south bank of Jingjiang in May, whether they are workers, military personnel, or civilian laborers, everyone has a common wish in their hearts: to complete the Jingjiang flood diversion project on time and make contributions to the cause of peaceful construction in the motherland!

    荆江南岸的五月
    新华社记者　姚昌淦
    荆江南岸荆江分洪工程的工地上，万千工人、军工和民工，正进行着一场空前紧张的斗争。比往年来得要快的洪水，现在正在步步向荆江分洪工地逼进。太平口的水位已升到三十八公尺，比开工以来的最低水位涨了五公尺。再过一个半月，长江大汛就要来到。现在，荆江分洪工程太平口进洪闸工地上，成千上万的技术工人、解放军战士和农民，都正在手脚不停地施工，和洪水争时间。混凝土拌和机、抽水机、起重机和各种动力机械的马达声轰鸣不憩。夜里，数千盏电灯和探照灯映红了半个天。荆江分洪工程各个工地都已进入密锣紧鼓的施工阶段。
    太平口进洪闸和黄山头节制闸都在浇灌混凝土，这是红五月里的一项艰巨的任务。为了赢得时间，现在太平口进洪闸全闸五十四孔底基和上游阻滑版工程的施工，从清基、测量、立模型板直到扎钢筋和浇灌混凝土，都是采取纵横交错而又前后衔接的办法在全力突击着。作混凝土工的技术工人、钢筋工人和战士、木工都保证：“第一步工程做到那里，第二步工程跟到那里。”每个人都明白自己的劳动，对国家建设和人民幸福事业的重大意义。竭力使自己的工作，能配合上整个工程的进展。来自长沙的技工余祥元锤直钢筋小队，已由每天每组锤三十根提高到六十根、八十根，最高达到一百二十根。弯钢筋小队的技工陈忠华和张筱安想出了用模型代替钳子弯圆钢筋的办法，不但快了一倍，而且质量好。以前钢筋中队的工作和木工队和混凝土队的工作或快或慢，前拉后推，衔接不好；现在他们互相推动着，工作效率都提高了。
    修太平口进洪闸的人们，有好多人连看也没有看过这种现代化的水利建筑物；就是对武汉和上海来的建筑工人说，这样具有高度技术性的扎闸墩钢架的工作也还是第一次上手。但是，他们在紧张的劳动中学会了本领、熟练了技术。军工也学会了拌和混凝土中的调整水灰比例。推小车的战士在狭窄不到一尺宽的跳板上来去飞奔。他们都在短短的时间内学会了几套本领。有一个青年班长郭妮，别人下班回去了，他还留在工地上，参加下一班工作；有空就找工程师问，看工人们做。这样，他两天三夜便把土工的一套技术全摸熟了。
    现在正是江南的雨季，三两天就要下一场雨。每次风雨一来，人们的衣服淋湿，砂尘吹得眼都睁不开，但都淋不熄、吹不灭每个人的劳动热情。五月二三两日，整天风雨不停，工人、战士和民工，都是冒雨工作。枝江县三大队三中队的民工，他们在雨天和晴天一样地完成了每天的土方工程，荣获第一模范单位的“英雄”红旗。
    五月的荆江南岸的各个工地上，无论工人、军工和民工，每个人心里都怀着一个共同的心愿：按时完成荆江分洪工程，在祖国和平建设事业中立功！
