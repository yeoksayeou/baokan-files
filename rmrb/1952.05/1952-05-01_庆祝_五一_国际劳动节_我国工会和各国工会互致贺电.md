    Congratulatory letter from the Japan Liaison Office of the World Federation of Trade Unions Dear Comrades:
    On the occasion of the 1952 "May Day," the Japan Liaison Office of the World Federation of Trade Unions extends fraternal congratulations to all of you.
    Regardless of the opposition of the Japanese people and the peace forces of the world, the imperialists and the Shigeru Yoshida government not only stubbornly signed the so-called "peace" treaty and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, but also recently concluded the Japan-U.S. Administrative Agreement.
    Now Japan has become an appendage of other countries, many military bases have been established throughout the country, many factories have been used for military purposes, the Japanese people have been regarded as slaves, and are planned to be used as cannon fodder for invading Asia and expanding the Korean War.
    However, the entire people and farmers of Japan, under the leadership and leadership of organized workers, are carrying out a struggle to improve living standards, strive for national liberation, and defend peace in the midst of insane oppression.
    Japanese workers have also launched a nationwide struggle to demand higher wages and oppose the reactionary attempt to oppress the people.
    Dear Comrades!
    The Japan Liaison Office of the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing the Japanese working class, guarantees to actively invest in the fierce struggle to improve living standards, strive for national liberation, and defend peace, and unite with the Asian countries and the working class of the world to strive to organize the upcoming great demonstration movement of "May Day."
    In this case, our Japanese working class hopes to receive your fraternal congratulations in a timely manner before "May Day."
    Glory belongs to the camp striving for peace and national liberation!
    Long live the unity of workers around the world and the World Federation of Trade Unions!
    Japan Liaison Office of the World Federation of Trade Unions

    世界工会联合会日本联络事务局的贺信亲爱的同志们：
    欣逢一九五二年“五一”节，世界工会联合会日本联络事务局向你们全体致以兄弟的祝贺。
    帝国主义者和吉田茂政府不顾日本人民与全世界和平力量的反对，不仅横蛮地签订了所谓“和”约和日美安全条约、而且新近又订立了日美行政协定。
    现在日本变成了别国的附属国，全境建立了许多军事基地，许多工厂被利用作为军用，日本人民被视为奴隶，并被计划为充当侵略亚洲和扩大朝鲜战争的炮灰。
    然而，日本全体人民与农民在有组织的工人发动下和领导下，在疯狂的压迫中，正在进行着争取改善生活、争取民族解放与保卫和平的斗争。
    日本工人也发动了全国性的斗争，要求提高工资与反对反动派企图压迫人民的法律。
    亲爱的同志们！
    世界工会联合会日本联络事务局代表着日本工人阶级，保证自己积极投入剧烈的争取改善生活、争取民族解放与保卫和平的斗争，并与亚洲国家和全世界工人阶级团结起来，争取组织即将到来的“五一”节的伟大示威运动。
    在这种情况下，我们日本工人阶级很希望在“五一”节前及时收到你们寄给我们的兄弟的祝贺。
    光荣属于争取和平与民族解放的阵营！
    全世界工人和世界工会联合会团结万岁！
    世界工会联合会日本联络事务局
