    (1) The anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland have arrived in Korea. This news, which they had been waiting for day and night, immediately caused a sensation in a certain anti-aircraft artillery battalion of the Volunteer Army. The battalion selected the best gun commanders, gunners, and the most skilled truck drivers from each company to receive the guns; other soldiers immediately began digging positions for the new guns.
    (2) The first batch of brand-new anti-aircraft guns has been received. The gunners, driving tractors, sped along the wide, flat highway, singing joyfully: "The motor roars, the hearts of the soldiers beat. Huge gun muzzles, rolling wheels, speeding through the road to victory. Forward! Artillerymen of the motherland, artillerymen of the people, compete for heroism on the battlefield, perform meritorious service for the people!"
    (3) The next night, the anti-aircraft artillery team arrived at a bridge in a certain area, where dozens of vehicles were waiting at both ends of the bridge to cross. Suddenly, an enemy plane came, flying low and circling above the bridge, and dropped flares. In order to protect the bridge and the vehicles, the deputy battalion commander in charge immediately ordered the gunners to prepare to fire.

    祖国人民捐献的高射炮到了朝鲜前线
    （根据刘尔宁原文绘）

    （一）祖国人民捐献的高射炮到了朝鲜。这个日夜盼望着的消息马上轰动了志愿军某高射炮营。营里挑选了各连最优秀的炮车长、炮手和技术最好的汽车司机去领炮；其他战士立即动手替新炮挖掘阵地。
    （二）第一批崭新的高射炮领到了。炮手们驾驶着牵引车奔驰在宽阔平坦的公路上，喜气洋洋地唱着：“摩托发出了响声，战士的心脏在跳动。巨大的炮口，滚动的车轮，飞驰过胜利的路程。前进！祖国的炮兵，人民的炮兵，战场上争英雄，为人民立战功！”
    （三）第二天晚上，高射炮队到达某地的一座大桥边，有几十辆汽车正在桥的两头等着过桥。忽然间来了一架敌机，在桥的上空低飞盘旋，并且投下了照明弹。为了保卫桥梁和汽车，领队的副营长立刻命令炮手们预备射击。
