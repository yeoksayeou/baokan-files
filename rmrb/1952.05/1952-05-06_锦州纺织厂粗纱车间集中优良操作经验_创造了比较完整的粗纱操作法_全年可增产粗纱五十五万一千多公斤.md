    Jinzhou Textile Factory's Roving Workshop Concentrates Excellent Operational Experience
    Creating Relatively Complete Roving Operation Method
    Can Increase Production of More Than 551,000 Kilograms of Roving Annually

    The roving workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Northeast China, using the Kovalev working method, concentrated the operating experience of twenty-seven roving workers to create a relatively complete set of roving working methods. If all the workers in the workshop implement this method in the future, they can increase the production of roving by 551,053.8 kilograms annually, which is equivalent to the annual output of seven roving machines, equivalent to the wealth of 820 tons of grain.

    After the Jinzhou Textile Factory vigorously promoted the "Hao Jianxiu Working Method" last year and increased the output of fine yarn, the roving was not enough. The leading cadres of the roving workshop studied the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method and prepared to promote it in the roving workshop. However, since there was no relatively complete operating procedure in the past, everyone did their own thing, and most of the workers' conservative ideas were very serious, thinking: "The Hao Jianxiu Working Method is used in the fine yarn workshop, and the roving workshop cannot use it or learn it." According to this situation, the leading cadres of the roving workshop first convened a meeting of activists to study and determine: according to the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, using the Kovalev working method, concentrate everyone's operating experience to create a practical roving working method, and then promote it. After mobilization and education, twenty-seven workers voluntarily signed up to participate in the creation of roving operation method performance. After a month of performance, measurement, and research by the technical research association, according to the basic spirit of the Hao Jianxiu Working Method, the operating experience of twenty-seven people was concentrated, and a relatively advanced roving operation method was created. In order to encourage the collective creative spirit of these twenty-seven people, it was named "February Seventh Operation Method."

    The main features of the "February Seventh Operation Method" are: all the actions of the roving worker revolve around reducing yarn breakage and shortening downtime; the work is planned and regular; the cleaning work is done well; the two-person mutual assistance piecing method for opposite cars is implemented (if two ends break, one person pieces one end, if one end breaks, one person pieces the end and the other person picks cotton from the spindle cap).

    The roving workshop is currently promoting this advanced operation method through performances (according to the various actions of the "February Seventh Operation Method"). After preliminary promotion, oil yarn, double-strand yarn, and yarn breakage have been reduced. Because the mutual assistance piecing method is implemented, the downtime for piecing is shortened, the mechanical efficiency is brought into play, and the output is increased. Before the creation of the "February Seventh Operation Method," due to the large number of yarn breakages and the long downtime for piecing, the mechanical efficiency was only 82% (the factory stipulates 83.5%). After the promotion of the "February Seventh Operation Method," the mechanical efficiency reached an average of 87%, and a maximum of 94%. Due to the improvement of machine efficiency, the entire workshop can produce an additional 1,697.3 kilograms of roving per day, and the annual increase in production value is equivalent to about 820 tons of grain. The phenomenon that roving supply is insufficient and affects fine yarn production has also been overcome.

    After the promotion of this operation method, the workers have also changed from being dominated by machines to actively dominating machines, thereby reducing labor intensity. Workers Zhang Qingfu, Yu Haizhong, and Yu Honggang all said: "After the new operation method is promoted, everything is regular, the work does not wait for people, people go to find work; coupled with mutual assistance, both output and quality have improved, and it is not tiring at all!" Because the roving worker's mutual assistance doffing is implemented, the entire workshop can also reduce eighteen doffing workers every day.

    Roving workers are all paid by piecework. After the "February Seventh Operation Method" was promoted, the output and quality improved, and the workers' actual wages also increased by an average of 20 to 30%. The workers therefore further realized the consistency of national interests and individual interests.

    锦州纺织厂粗纱车间集中优良操作经验
    创造了比较完整的粗纱操作法
    全年可增产粗纱五十五万一千多公斤
    东北锦州纺织厂粗纱车间，运用郭瓦廖夫工作法，集中了二十七个粗纱工的操作经验，创造了一套比较完整的粗纱工作法。全车间职工今后如都执行这个方法，全年可增产粗纱五十五万一千零五十三点八公斤，等于七台粗纱机的全年产量，相当于八百二十吨粮食的财富。
    锦州纺织厂去年大力推广“郝建秀工作法”使细纱产量提高后，粗纱就不够用了。粗纱车间领导干部研究了郝建秀工作法的基本精神，便准备在粗纱车间推广。但由于过去没有一套比较完整的操作规程，各搞一套，大部分职工的保守思想很严重，认为：“郝建秀工作法是细纱车间用的，粗纱车间不能用，也不能学。”粗纱车间领导干部根据这一情况，首先召开积极分子会议，研究确定：根据郝建秀工作法的基本精神，用郭瓦廖夫工作法，把大家的操作经验集中起来，创造出一个切合实际的粗纱工作法，然后再推广它。经过动员教育，有二十七名工友自动报名参加创造粗纱操作法表演。经过一个月的表演、测定和技术研究会的研究，根据郝建秀工作法的基本精神，集中了二十七个人的操作经验，创造了一套比较先进的粗纱操作法。为了鼓励这二十七个人的集体创造精神，就把它定名为“二七操作法”。
    “二七操作法”的主要特点是：看车工的一切动作都围绕减少断头和缩短停车时间而进行；工作有计划、有规律；作好清洁工作；实行对面车的二人互助接头法（断两个头，一人接一个，断一个头，一人接头，一人摘锭帽子里棉花）。
    粗纱车间现正通过表演（按照“二七操作法”的各种动作）推广这个先进的操作方法。初步推广以后，油纱、双股纱、断头都减少了。因为实行了互助接头法，缩短了接头的停车时间，发挥了机械效能，提高了产量。在创造“二七操作法”前，因断头多和接头停车时间长，机械效能只发挥了百分之八十二（厂规定百分之八十三点五）。推广“二七操作法”后，机械效能的发挥平均达到了百分之八十七，最高达到百分之九十四。由于机器效率提高，全车间一天就可多生产一千六百九十七点三公斤粗纱，全年增产价值约相当于八百二十吨粮食。因粗纱供应不足而影响细纱生产的现象也克服了。
    推广这个操作法以后，工人也由被机器支配转为主动支配机器了，从而减轻了劳动强度。工人张庆福、于海忠、于洪钢都说：“新操作法推广后，干啥都有规律，不等活找人，人就找活去；再加上互助，产量和质量都提高了，还一点也不累！”因为实行了看车工的互助落纱，全车间每天还可减少十八名落纱工。
    粗纱看车工都是计件工资。“二七操作法”推广后，产量质量提高了，工人的实得工资也平均增加了二十到三十分。职工因此进一步认识到国家利益和个人利益的一致性。
