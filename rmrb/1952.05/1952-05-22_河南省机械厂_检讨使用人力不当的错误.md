    Henan Machinery Factory
    Self-Criticizes its Mistake in Improper Use of Manpower

    To the Editor: We have read the letter, forwarded by the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry, jointly criticizing our factory for the improper use of manpower, written by thirty-five students from the former Zhengzhou Senior Industrial School. We sincerely accept this criticism.

    Our factory started construction in May of last year. Everything was in its initial stages, and there was a severe lack of mid- and lower-level technical cadres. After applying, the Department of Industry successively assigned these thirty-five students to work at the factory. They were assigned to various sections, offices, and workshops, either in charge of engineering design, production management, or undertaking the actual manufacturing, inspection, and assembly work. We believe that this allocation was in line with the needs. However, when the first batch of students arrived at the factory, the Personnel Section retained one, and the Security Section also wanted one, which meant that these two students were not using their skills. Although this phenomenon was later corrected, it had already given the students a bad impression. We have not done enough in training cadres. We are busy with affairs all day long, and have not taken the time to provide diligent guidance; after assigning students to various units, we let them develop freely. The person in charge of individual units also did not pay attention to this issue. They thought that students who had just graduated from school were
    "ambitious but incompetent, unable to do big things, and unwilling to do small things." One engineer said: "I have no objection to transferring this student out of my workshop, because I really have no suitable work for him to do." These views and statements are wrong. We should give them suitable work, and educate, help, and cultivate them, and systematically gradually train them to become the backbone of technical work.

    We also did not pay enough attention to and promptly handle their promotion and salary assessment issues, which have been dragging on, causing anxiety among employees. This matter must not be delayed any longer, and we plan to handle it at the end of the "Three-Anti" campaign. The students' probationary period is planned to be six months, according to the Construction Bureau's precedent. After the performance appraisal, they will be promoted and assessed for salary, and the difference in wages will be paid retroactively. We are very grateful for the criticisms raised by the students, and we will quickly correct our shortcomings.

### 河南省机械厂  检讨使用人力不当的错误

    河南省机械厂
    检讨使用人力不当的错误
    编辑同志：我们已经看了由河南省人民政府工业厅转来的原郑州高级工业学校三十五位同学联名批评我厂使用人力不当的信件。我们诚恳地接受这个批评。
    我厂在去年五月开工，一切草创，中下级技术干部极为缺乏。经过申请，工业厅先后指派这三十五位同学来厂工作。他们被分派在各科、室、场，或主管工程设计，或主管生产管理，或担任实际制造检验和装配的工作。我们认为这样分配尚属合乎需要。但在第一批同学到厂时，人事科自留一名，保卫科也要去一名，这就使得这两位同学学非所用。以后虽然纠正了这种现象，但已给予同学们以不好的印象。我们对干部的培养是做得不够的。我们终日忙于事务，没有抽出时间勤加辅导；把同学派到各单位以后，任凭他们自由发展。有个别单位的主管人也不注意这个问题，他们以为新出校门的学生
    “眼高手低，高不成低不就，大事不会做，小事不肯做。”有一个工程师说：“把这个同学调出我场，我没有意见，因为我实在没有适当的工作给他做。”这些看法和说法都是错误的。我们应当给他们以适合的工作，加以教育、帮助和培养，有计划地逐渐培养他们成为技术工作的骨干。
    对于他们的升级和评薪问题，我们也没有加以足够的注意和及时的处理，一直拖着，引起职工情绪的不安。这件事万不能再拖，我们拟在“三反”末期处理。同学们的练习期，拟按建设局成例，定为六个月。考绩以后，再升级评薪，补发差额工资。我们非常感谢同学们所提出的批评，我们将迅速纠正缺点。　李葆和　杨志超
