　  Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 28th: Major Japanese labor unions are actively preparing to hold a third general strike to resolutely oppose the fascist "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" and the revision of labor laws.
    On May 22nd, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the "Struggle Committee Against Detrimental Revision of Labor Laws" held a joint meeting. The meeting decided that the third general strike would be held between June 5th and 10th. A joint statement by Sohyo and the "Struggle Committee Against Detrimental Revision of Labor Laws" stated that the third general strike would be "larger in scale and stronger in force" than the second general strike, which involved one million participants.
    Major industrial unions have also successively resolved to participate in the third general strike. The Japan Coal Miners' Union, which has approximately 270,000 members, has been holding a national congress in Tokyo since the 24th. The congress passed a proposal to participate in the third general strike. The All-Japan Electric Industry Workers' Union also held a national congress on the 21st and unanimously resolved to participate in the third general strike. At the same time, the Central Executive Committee of the Private Railway Workers' Union General Federation also decided on the 21st to take a consistent approach with the "Struggle Committee Against Detrimental Revision of Labor Laws."
    The call to oppose the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" continues to come from other sections of the people. While students are preparing for a general strike, professors at universities in Kyoto are increasingly expressing their opposition to the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act." On the 23rd, Professor Shinobu Tabata, Dean of the Faculty of Law at Doshisha University, convened a meeting of professors. President Setsuji Otsuka and all the professors unanimously resolved to oppose the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" and decided to launch a campaign against this anti-popular bill with the strength of the entire university.

    日本各大工会积极准备第三次总罢工
　  【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本各大工会组织积极准备举行第三次总罢工，以坚决反对法西斯的“防止破坏活动法案”和修改劳工法规。
    二十二日，日本工会总评议会和“反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会”举行联席会议，会议决定第三次总罢工举行的日期将在六月五日至十日之间。日本工会总评议会和“反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会”的联合声明表示，第三次总罢工将比有一百万人参加的第二次总罢工“规模更大，力量更强”。
    各重要产业工会也纷纷决议参加第三次总罢工。拥有会员约二十七万人的日本煤矿工会自二十四日起在东京举行全国代表大会。大会通过了参加第三次总罢工的提案。全日本电气产业工会在二十一日也举行了全国代表大会，一致决议参加第三次总罢工。同时，私营铁道工会总联合会中央执行委员会也在二十一日决定与“反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会”采取一致的步调。
    反对“防止破坏活动法案”的呼声，也不断从其他阶层的人民传来。与学生准备总罢课的同时，京都各大学的教授也日益表示反对“防止破坏活动法案”。同志社大学法学院院长田畑忍在二十三日召开了教授会议，校长大冢节治及全体教授一致决议反对“防止破坏活动法案”，并决定以全校的力量展开反对这一反人民的法案的运动。
