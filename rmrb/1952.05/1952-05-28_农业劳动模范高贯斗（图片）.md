    Agricultural Labor Model Gao Guandou
    Li Hua, Yu Xuexin
    I. Agricultural labor model Gao Guandou is from Dahujiazhuang Village, Shen County, Hebei Province. The farmers of this village, relying on the mutual aid teams organized under his leadership, improved the alkaline land and overcame droughts and insect plagues, laying the foundation for patriotic production increases. In 1950, he was elected as a labor model of Hebei Province and attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, receiving a warm welcome from the people of the whole country.
    II. The reason why Gao Guandou was able to improve production was because he implemented Chairman Mao's instruction to "get organized." The farmers of Dahujiazhuang Village were organized in 1943. Initially, some farmers did not know the benefits of organizing mutual aid teams, so they adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
    III. Gao Guandou was the village's production committee member at this time. Seeing this situation, he thought that he could not mobilize the masses without first setting an example. Therefore, he and Gao Hongzi and Gao Laoqian organized a work exchange group to quickly harvest the group's twenty-four mu of wheat, and then helped others with work, so that the masses could see the benefits of organizing mutual aid teams. From then on, the foundation for getting organized was laid.

    农业劳动模范高贯斗
    李桦  于学信作
    一、农业劳动模范高贯斗是河北省深县大护驾庄人。本庄农民依靠在他领导下组织起来的互助组，改良了碱地，战胜了旱灾、虫灾，奠定了爱国丰产的基础。一九五○年他被选为河北省劳动模范，并出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表大会，受到全国人民的热烈欢迎。
    二，高贯斗所以能把生产搞好，是因为他执行了毛主席“组织起来”的指示。大护驾庄的农民是在一九四三年组织起来的。最初，一部分农民还不知道组织互助组的好处，所以抱着观望的态度。
    三、高贯斗这时是村里的生产委员。他看了这种情况，心想，不先做个榜样是不能够把群众发动起来的。因此他就和高红子、高老乾组织了拨工组，把组里的二十四亩小麦赶快收完，又给别人帮工，让群众看一看组织互助组的好处。从此打下了组织起来的基础。
