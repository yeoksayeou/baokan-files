(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th) Following the confessions of U.S. Air Force Lieutenants Enok and Quinn, captured by the Korean and Chinese People's forces, which revealed the truth about the U.S. aggressors' crimes of bacteriological warfare, people from all walks of life and prominent figures in Korea have expressed even greater anger and issued statements sternly denouncing this unprecedented crime, vowing to sever the bloody hands of the U.S. aggressors.

    The well-known production innovator and female worker, Lian Zhenzi, said: The sinister plot of the U.S. aggressors is doomed to failure, and the bacteriological warfare criminals will absolutely not escape the justice of humanity. We are even more enraged by the enemy's escalating atrocities. The Korean workers and all the people, together, must strengthen the struggle against bacteriological warfare and resolutely avenge this.

    The well-known legal worker, Jin Dongzhe, said in his speech: The heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism have long been confirmed by a large amount of conclusive material evidence, human testimony, and the investigation by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, and now they have been confirmed by the confessions of U.S. POWs. The criminals' own confession is the most complete evidence. This has very clearly confirmed the inhuman crimes of the U.S. aggressors. What new, shameless tricks can Acheson, who has been trying to quibble, and Lie, who is trying his best to cover up for his American masters, possibly come up with? The time to severely punish the organizers and participants of bacteriological warfare is approaching!

    Pastor Park Ki-hwan, Secretary-General of the North Korean Christian League, also sternly denounced the heinous crimes of the U.S. aggressors in his speech; he called on all good people to firmly safeguard the right to human existence and morality, and severely punish the bacteriological warfare criminals.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 9th) The Secretariat of the International Union of Students has sent a pamphlet entitled "Documents and Evidence Regarding Bacteriological Warfare" to all student organizations and scientific institutions around the world.

    This pamphlet includes excerpts of all important documents proving the U.S. crimes of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The last part of the booklet contains the statement issued by the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students at its meeting in Budapest in March, calling on students around the world to step up their efforts to stop the U.S. from conducting bacteriological warfare.

    The Press and Information Department of the International Union of Students also published a special collection of photographs exposing the crimes of U.S. bacteriological warfare.

    The Secretariat of the International Union of Students also sent a letter to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), requesting it to express its opposition to any bacteriological warfare, and requesting it to send a letter to the governments of the member states of UNESCO, urging them to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological warfare.

    美军战俘的供词是最完全的罪证
    朝鲜人民一致声讨美国侵略者的罪行
    国际学联发布“关于细菌战的文件与证据”小册子
    【新华社平壤九日电】在朝中人民部队俘获的美国空军中尉伊纳克和奎恩两人的供词揭露了美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行真相之后，朝鲜各界人民与著名人士更加愤怒万分，纷纷发表谈话，严正声讨这种史无前例的罪行，并表示决心斩断美国侵略者的血腥魔手。
    著名的生产革新者女工廉贞子说：美国侵略者的险恶阴谋是注定要破产的，细菌战犯们也绝对逃不脱人类的正义裁判。我们为敌人有加无已的暴行而更加激愤。朝鲜工人和全体人民一道，一定要加强反细菌战的斗争，坚决报仇。
    著名的法律工作者金东哲在谈话中说：美帝国主义的滔天罪行早已被大量确凿的物证、人证以及国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的调查所证实，现在又为美军战俘的供词所证实。犯罪者自己的招供，是最完全的罪证。这已非常明确地肯定了美国侵略者灭绝人性的罪行。一直妄图狡赖的艾奇逊，和竭力为其美国主子掩饰罪责的赖伊，还能玩出什么新的无耻花样呢？严惩细菌战的组织者和参与者的时机已经临近了！
    北朝鲜基督教徒联盟书记长朴基焕牧师在谈话中也严正声讨美国侵略者的万恶罪行；他号召全体善良人类坚决维护人类的生存权利和道德，严厉惩处细菌战犯。
    【新华社布拉格九日电】国际学生联合会书记处向全世界一切学生组织和科学机构发出了一个“关于细菌战的文件与证据”的小册子。
    这个小册子包括一切证明美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行的重要文件的摘录。小册子的最后一部分刊载着国际学生联合会执行委员会三月间在布达佩斯举行的会议所发表的声明，号召全世界学生加紧努力，制止美国进行细菌战。
    国际学生联合会新闻宣传部还发表了一个照片特辑，揭露美国进行细菌战的罪行。
    国际学生联合会书记处并致函联合国教育、科学及文化组织，要求它表示反对任何细菌战，并要求它致函联合国教育、科学及文化组织的各成员国政府，敦促它们批准禁止进行细菌战的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。
