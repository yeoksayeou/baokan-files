	New Records on the Production Front
	Able to Exceed Axle Load Even on an 18‰ Gradient
	Responding to the call of the Ministry of Railways and other leading organs to launch the movement of full load, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers, the crew members of the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Depot are all determined to exceed axle load. However, the route they take has a large gradient, and some people say: "It is impossible to exceed axle load on a large gradient." Driver Yan Shuanqing of locomotive No. 394, based on his own experience, proposed to the leadership: "As long as the locomotive is operated properly, it is possible to exceed axle load on a large gradient." On May 11, he and other drivers boldly accepted the task of exceeding axle load, hauling an extra 234 tons of goods, and safely passed the 18‰ gradient on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line. (Wu Ruose)
	Locomotives in Northeast Forest Area Set New Records
	Locomotives in the forest area are also responding to the movement of full load, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers. Locomotive No. 604, in the style of Ma Hengchang of the Suiling Forest Railway Sub-bureau Locomotive Depot in Northeast China, ran 326 kilometers in one day on May 21 (the standard is 280 kilometers), setting the highest record for daily locomotive kilometers in the country's forest areas.
	Small Locomotives on the Huainan Line Ran Over 800 Kilometers in One Day
	Employees of the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau Dispatching Office actively organized locomotives to run five hundred kilometers in the movement of full load, exceeding axle load, and five hundred kilometers. In the past, they heard some people say: the locomotives on the Huainan Line are small locomotives and cannot run five hundred kilometers. They carefully studied the situation and affirmed that small locomotives on the Huainan Line can run five hundred kilometers. On May 20, driver Li Zhaoxiang and others on locomotive ㄙ?5373 ran 813.6 kilometers between Jiulonggang and Yuxikou. When the drivers on the Huainan Line heard the news, they all said: "Small locomotives can also run fast!"

	Small Locomotives at Fengtai Locomotive Depot Can Also Exceed Axle Load
	The crew members of small locomotive 攵?9135 at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot, seeing the deeds of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive exceeding axle load repeatedly, wondered: "Can small locomotives exceed axle load?" Some people said: "No! Exceeding axle load will damage the locomotive." But driver Liu Zhaolong and co-driver Chen Hongnian believed: "We can try." On May 5, Liu Zhaolong took the lead in hauling extra goods, and then driver Lu Baoshu also requested to haul more. As a result, they hauled three trains, hauling a total of more than 3,100 tons extra. (Yu Lianzhong, Zhang Wenhao)
	Workers at Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Plant Continuously Set New Records in May
	In May, the workers at the Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Plant continuously set new records, and there were many technical improvements. When manufacturing 500-meter coal chutes, the Ge Chunhua team in the riveting and forging shop clearly divided the work, improved the operating methods, and doubled the efficiency, completing the sixty-five-day task in seventeen and a half days. When installing the electrical components for a × horsepower winch in the electrical shop, the efficiency of rolling mica tubes was very slow. The workers used their brains to create tools, increasing the efficiency from only two and a half tubes per day for two people in the past to sixty tubes. The foundry and lathe shop movers also used their brains and found many "tricks." Employee Dong Wenzhong, seeing that there were many rework rejects in the past, came up with a solution and established a rework reject registration form. In May, the reject rate decreased by 50% compared to April. The workers' creations quickly gained the attention of the leading cadres. The Pingxiang Mining Bureau established an "Advanced Experience Promotion Committee" to specifically summarize and promote advanced experiences, strengthen publicity work, and solve technical problems. Therefore, these new records have mostly been consolidated.

	Hebei Handan Flour Mill Sets New Record for Flour Production
	The employees of the Hebei Public Handan Flour Mill have set a new record for flour production since the factory was built thirty-two years ago, with a maximum hourly output of 121 bags. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the Handan Flour Mill only produced 16.7 bags of flour per hour. After liberation, with the increase in workers' awareness, production has also risen step by step. In the first quarter of this year, the average hourly output was 84 bags of flour, and in April of the second quarter, the average hourly output was 93.185 bags of flour. From May 3 to May 12, the average hourly output was 103.6 bags of flour, with a maximum of 121 bags.

    生产战线上的新纪录
    在千分之十八的大坡道上也能够超轴
    太原北站机务段乘务员，响应铁道部等领导机关关于开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的号召，都决心要超轴。但是他们走的线路是大坡道，有的人说：“大坡道不能超轴。”“三九四号”机车司机阎栓庆根据自己的经验，向上级提出：“只要好好操纵机车，大坡道超轴是可以的。”五月十一日，他和其他司机大胆地接受了超轴的任务，多拉了二百三十四吨货物，安全地通过了石太线上的千分之十八的大坡道。  （吴若瑟）
    东北森林区机车创造新纪录
    森林区的铁路机车也响应了满载、超轴、五百公里运动。东北绥棱森林铁路分局机务段马恒昌式的六○四号机车，在五月二十一日一天内，跑了三百二十六公里（标准为二八○公里），创造了全国森林区机车日车公里的最高纪录。
    淮南线小型机车一天内跑了八百多公里
    蚌埠铁路分局调度所员工在满载、超轴、五百公里运动中，积极地组织机车跑五百公里。他们过去听到有的人说：淮南线的机车是小型机车，不能跑五百公里。他们认真地研究了情况，肯定了淮南线小型机车可以跑五百公里。五月二十日，ㄙ?5三七三号机车司机李兆祥等，就在九龙岗和裕溪口之间跑了八百十三点六公里。淮南线的司机听到了这个消息，都说：“小型机车也能快跑呵！”

    丰台机务段小型机车也能够超轴
    丰台机务段攵?九一三五号小型机车的乘务员，看见“毛泽东号”机车一再超轴的事迹，他们就想：“小型机车能不能超轴呢？”有些人说：“不能！超轴了，会弄伤机车的。”但是司机刘兆龙和副司机陈鸿年却认为：“可以试试”。五月五日，刘兆龙带头多拉了货物，接着司机陆宝书也要求多拉，结果他们拉了三趟车，共多拉了三千一百多吨。　（于连仲、张文浩）
    萍乡煤矿机厂职工五月份连续创造新纪录
    五月份，萍乡煤矿机厂工人们连续地创造了新纪录，并且有许多技术改进。铆锻间葛春华小组在制造五百公尺煤溜子时，明确分工，改进操作方法，提高效率一倍，六十五天的任务十七天半就完成了。电工间在进行×匹马力绞车电气安装时，卷云母管的效率很慢。工人们开动脑筋创造了工具，从过去两个人一天只能卷两根半的效率，提高到能卷六十根了。铸工间、车工间搬运工人也都开动脑筋，找出了许多“窍门”。职员董文中看到过去翻工废品很多，想出了办法，建立了翻工废品登记表。五月份废品率比四月份降低百分之五十。工人的创造很快地得到了领导干部的重视。萍乡矿务局成立了“先进经验推广委员会”，专门总结和推广先进经验，加强宣传工作，解决技术问题。因此，这些新纪录大都已巩固起来。
