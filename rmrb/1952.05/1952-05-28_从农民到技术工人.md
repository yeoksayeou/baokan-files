    The Banqiao Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Huai River has been completed. During the year-long construction of the reservoir, there were more than three hundred people like this: they were originally farmers who tilled the land, and when they first arrived at the construction site, they only knew how to dig and carry earth; but later, they held sledgehammers, pliers and other tools, and were active on the railways, electric poles and bridges all day long. As the reservoir construction progressed, they learned a complete set of techniques from the workers while participating in the work of the transportation group and mechanical group's line work teams. Over the past year, they have laid 22 kilometers of light railway, erected about 74 kilometers of electric wires, built more than 70 temporary bridges, and constructed more than 10 kilometers of roads. In addition, they also did a lot of rush work such as repairing electric lights, driving piles, and moving tracks.

    When the Banqiao Reservoir started construction, there was a general shortage of skilled workers. At that time, after discussions between the project leaders and the workers, it was decided to select a group of outstanding laborers from the Huai River harnessing laborers in various counties to learn technology. When this group of laborers took on new jobs, they initially started learning technology out of curiosity. They saw that when the generator was turned on, countless electric lights on the construction site opened their bright eyes, and one electric light was much brighter than the small oil lamp in their home. As soon as the water pump "clacked", large streams of water "哗哗" gushed out of the pipe. A dozen stone-loaded dump trucks flew along the railway with the effort of a few people...and so on. However, at this time they also encountered many difficulties: they didn't know how to hold the sledgehammer, how to connect the wires, or how to lay the rails. They felt that doing these tasks was not as easy as carrying earth. Some of the laborers lost heart and said, "How long will it take to learn this!"

    The workers understood the difficulties the laborers faced in learning technology, and also understood the important responsibility they bore in the country's construction cause. Everyone was happy to patiently help the laborers learn technology. Electrician Dai Jingchun said, "Helping the laborers learn technology will enable us to have more skilled workers in the future, and build our country stronger." When the workers taught the laborers technology, they first explained the principles and properties of various technologies to the laborers, and adopted the method of watching first and then doing. If some laborers couldn't understand or learn, the workers would draw pictures to explain and teach them by holding their hands. The workers' spirit of patience and responsibility moved every laborer, and quickly changed them from lacking confidence to worrying about learning technology all the time, even when eating, walking, and resting. They recited in their mouths, remembered in their hearts, and drew on the ground with their hands. Xu Hongtian, a laborer from the line work team, said, "We worry about learning technology, and we even dream of climbing electric poles to connect wires at night!"

    In this way, they learned the techniques of paving roads, building bridges, erecting electric wires, and repairing electric lights. In the reservoir construction, they used their wisdom, constantly improved their working methods, and made great achievements. For example, when they started connecting rails, the laborers each took a tool and didn't know where to start. It took six people a lot of effort to connect a rail. Later, the worker comrades mobilized them to come up with ideas to improve their work methods. As a result, Liu Zhengfu, a laborer, connected the rail by himself step by step, using both his hands and feet. When pushing the dump truck through the switch, it was necessary to climb the track back and forth, which was both troublesome and easy to cause the dump truck to derail. After researching with the workers and laborers, they came up with a way to make a cross track with two short rails in the middle of the switch, which not only eliminated the need to climb the track, but also ensured safety.

    During the reservoir construction, workers and laborers forged a deep friendship in work and life. Usually, the workers were also very concerned about the laborers' diet and warmth, and some lent their clothes to the laborers. When laborers were injured or sick, the workers would always visit the hospital continuously. The laborers respected the workers very much and affectionately called the technicians "masters." Sometimes, when the laborers saw the workers setting up lines in the distance, eating cold steamed buns, they would immediately send their own hot steamed buns over.

    In the reservoir construction, the laborers deeply recognized the greatness of the working class. Wang Jiaqing, a laborer from the transportation group, said, "We used to think that workers and farmers were two different groups that didn't interfere with each other. Now we know that the two are inseparable. The workers are helping us to harness the Huai River, which will not only bring us happiness in the present, but also happiness for our children and grandchildren forever." The workers also admired the laborers' hardworking, brave, and actively learning spirit. Electrician Wang Fulin said, "In the wind and snow, the laborers' hands were frozen, but they continued to work after breathing on them, and they climbed the electric poles, sweating all over, but they still worked. When they got off work, they exchanged experiences with each other, and continued to study under the electric lights late at night. This spirit is worth learning from!"

### 从农民到技术工人

    从农民到技术工人
    新华社记者  李人怡
    淮河上游的板桥水库已经修成了。为时一年多的建库工程中，有三百多个这样的人：他们原来都是种地的农民，初到工地时，他们只会挖土、挑土；但后来他们手里拿着大锤、钳子等工具，整天活跃在铁道上、电杆上和桥梁上。随着建库工程进展，他们在参加交通组和机械组线工班的工作中，从工人同志那里学会了成套的技术。一年来，他们在工地上铺设了二十二公里轻便铁轨，架设了约七十四公里的电线，修建了七十多座临时的桥，修筑了十多公里公路。此外，他们还作了修电灯、打桩、移轨道许多突击性的工作。
    板桥水库开工时，技术工人普遍不够。当时工程领导上和工人同志研究后，便决定从各县治淮民工中抽调一批优秀的民工学习技术。这一批民工走上新的工作岗位后，开始时他们对学习技术多从好奇心出发。他们看到：发电机一开工地上无数只电灯就睁开了明亮的眼睛，一盏电灯比他们家里的小油灯不知亮到多少倍。抽水机“咯咯”一响，水管就“哗哗”地冒出大股水来。十几辆装石头的斗车，几个人用力一推就在铁道上飞跑……等。但是，这时他们也遇到不少困难：大锤子不知怎么拿，电线不知怎样接，铁轨不知怎样放，他们深感干这些活不如抬土容易。有的民工泄气地说：“这要学到啥时候才能学得会啊！”
    工人们了解到民工们学习技术的困难，也懂得自己在祖国建设事业中所担负的重大责任。每个人都乐意耐心地帮助民工学会技术。电工戴景春说：“我们帮助民工学会技术，将来才能有更多的技术工人，把我们的祖国建设得更富强。”工人在教民工学技术时，先对民工讲清各种技术的原理和性能，采取先看后做的方法。有的民工看不懂、学不会，工人就画图解释，抓着手教他们。工人这种耐心负责的精神感动了每个民工，使他们很快由缺乏信心变得连吃饭、走路、休息，时时刻刻都在操心学技术。他们嘴上念着，心里记着，手还在地上划着。线工班民工许宏田说：“咱操心学技术，夜里做梦还爬在电杆上接线呢！”
    就这样，他们学会了铺路、架桥、架电线、装修电灯等技术。他们在建库工程中，发挥了自己的智慧，不断改进工作方法，作出很大的成绩。例如开始接轨时，民工们各拿一个工具，不知先从那里下手，六个人费了很大力气才接上了一条轨。后来工人同志发动他们出主意改进工作方法，结果民工刘正富按步就班，手脚并用，一个人就能把轨道接上。推斗车经过岔道时需来回攀道，既麻烦又容易使斗车出轨。工人和民工研究后想办法在岔道中间用两根短轨做成十字道，既不用攀道，又保证了安全。
    建库工程中，工人和民工在工作上、在生活中都结下了深厚的友谊。平时工人对民工的饮食和冷暖也非常关心，有的把自己的衣服借给民工穿。遇到民工中有受伤或生病的，工人总不断地到医院去探望。民工们对工人非常尊敬，都亲热地称技工为“师傅”。有时民工们看到工人在很远的地方架线，吃着冷馒头，他们立即把自己的热馒头送过去。
    民工们在建库工程中，都深深地认识了工人阶级的伟大。交通组民工王家清说：“咱过去认为工人和农民是两个班儿，各不碍事。现在才知道两下是离不开的。工人帮助我们治好淮河，不但眼前享到幸福，而且子子孙孙都永远幸福。”工人对民工的勤劳勇敢积极学习技术的精神也很敬佩。电工王福林说：“大风大雪中，民工们手冻僵了，呵一口气还是继续工作，爬电杆累得满身大汗还是干，下工时又互相交流经验，深夜里还在电灯下继续研究，这种精神值得我们学习！”
