Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 8th: This reporter reports: The US attempt to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations reached a new peak on the 7th, with the US chief representative, Joy, unreasonably demanding an indefinite recess of the negotiations.

Now, only one obstacle hinders both sides from reaching a final agreement, and that is the unreasonable demand of the US side to forcibly detain our captured personnel. Therefore, the long-awaited Korean armistice is, in fact, within reach. However, the records of the plenary sessions of both delegations show that the US negotiators, fearing the imminent prospect of peace, are resorting to the most barbaric means of sabotage, openly refusing to negotiate, to continue obstructing the Korean armistice agreement that the people of the world are eagerly awaiting.

Under the cover of secret meetings, Joy attempted to close the door to further negotiations. He brazenly rejected the fair proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side on May 2nd for a comprehensive solution to the remaining issues. This plan agreed to the US side's views on neutral nations but required the US side to withdraw the false issue of airfields and accept the Korean-Chinese side's solution to the prisoner of war issue that reconciled the views of both sides.

Joy stubbornly insisted on his so-called "comprehensive solution." He demanded that the Korean-Chinese side abandon the nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation, to which the US side has never been able to offer any tenable objections. He also demanded that the Korean-Chinese side agree to their forcible detention of more than 100,000 of our captured personnel, while the US side was only willing to withdraw the unreasonable demand to restrict airfields (a false issue that has nothing to do with the armistice negotiations).

Joy said this plan was "final and unchangeable." He said that the US side's illegal "screening" of our captured personnel had become a "fait accompli" that could not be greatly changed. General Nam Il reminded him that in negotiations conducted on an equal footing, both sides must make concessions to each other. Joy's reply, however, was, "We have put forward the final comprehensive plan. We will never make any further concessions."

Joy expressed the US side's unwillingness to negotiate with increasing arrogance day by day. He said on May 3rd that continuing to debate and propose counter-proposals would be "futile" and that "any plan that differs in substance from the United Nations Command's April 28th proposal cannot be accepted." On May 4th, he said again that the US plan "must constitute the final agreement." In the following two days, when General Nam Il asked him if he had any opinions to express, Joy replied that he had nothing else to say but to demand that the Korean-Chinese side accept his plan. Both meetings adjourned in less than fifteen minutes after the meeting started, because the US side was not even interested in continuing the discussion.

However, the arrogant attitude of the US side cannot have any impact on the Korean-Chinese representatives. General Nam Il repeatedly warned Joy, "If your purpose is to use this to threaten our side, I must frankly tell you that your threat can never have any impact on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers."

The meeting on May 7th marked a new peak in the US attempt to sabotage the negotiations. Joy unreasonably suggested an indefinite recess until the Korean-Chinese side agreed to the US side's forcible detention of 100,000 prisoners of war.

General Nam Il gave a very clear answer: "Our side firmly believes that our plan of May 2nd is the only reasonable compromise plan for a comprehensive solution to the remaining issues... Your threatening attitude to stop the meeting can only show your determination to delay, and even sabotage, the armistice negotiations."

Our side has made it clear that the Korean-Chinese side will never yield to the unilateral, barbaric, and unreasonable US plan. Our side has done everything possible for the armistice negotiations, and the next step in the armistice negotiations lies entirely with the US side.

### 美方破坏朝鲜谈判的企图达到新的高峰  公然要求无限期休会拒绝协商遣俘问题

    美方破坏朝鲜谈判的企图达到新的高峰
    公然要求无限期休会拒绝协商遣俘问题
    【新华社开城八日电】本社记者报道：美方破坏朝鲜停战谈判的企图在七日达到新的高峰，美方首席代表乔埃竟无理要求谈判无限期休会。
    现在只有一个障碍阻挠双方达成最后协议，这就是美方所坚持的强迫扣留我方被俘人员的无理要求。因此，期待已久的朝鲜停战事实上已是伸手可及了。但是，双方代表团大会的记录说明，美方谈判代表害怕迫在眼前的和平前景，正不惜采取公然拒绝协商的最蛮横的破坏手段，来继续阻挠全世界人民迫切期待着的朝鲜停战协议。
    在秘密会议的掩护下，乔埃企图关闭进一步协商的大门。他悍然拒绝朝中方面五月二日提出的全盘解决下余各项问题的公正方案。这一方案同意美方关于中立国的意见，但要美方撤回虚假的机场问题，并接受朝中方面对战俘问题提出的调和双方意见的解决办法。
    乔埃顽固地坚持他所谓的“全盘解决办法”。他要求朝中方面放弃提名苏联为中立国，而对这一提名，美方从来都提不出任何站得住脚的反对理由。他并要求朝中方面同意他们强行扣留十万多名我方被俘人员，而美方则仅只愿意撤回所谓限制机场（一个与停战谈判毫不相干的虚假问题）的无理要求。
    乔埃说这个方案是“最后的、不可改变的”。他说，美方对我方被俘人员非法的“甄别”已成“既成事实”，无法大加改变。南日将军提醒他注意：在双方以平等地位进行的谈判中，双方必须相互让步。而乔埃的答复却是，“我们已提出最后的全盘方案。我们决不再作任何让步。”
    乔埃一天比一天傲慢地表示美方不愿进行协商。他在五月三日说，继续辩论和提出对案都“无济于事”，“任何在实质上与联合国军四月二十八日的方案有所不同的方案，都决不能接受”。五月四日，他又说，美方的方案“必须构成最后的协议”。在以后两天，当南日将军问他是否有任何意见发表时，乔埃回答说，他别无话可说，只要求朝中方面接受他的方案。两次会议都在开会不到十五分钟之后休会，因为美方甚至对于继续讨论都毫不感兴趣。
    但是，美方的骄横态度并不能对朝中代表发生任何影响。南日将军一再正告乔埃，“如果你方的目的是利用这来威胁我方，我必须坦白正告你们，你方这种威胁绝不能对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军发生任何影响。”
    五月七日的会议标志着美方破坏谈判的企图达到新的高峰。乔埃无理地建议无限期休会，直到朝中方面同意美方强行扣留十万名战俘时为止。
    南日将军给予万分明确的答复：“我方坚定地认为我方五月二日的方案是全面解决下剩各项问题的唯一合理的折衷方案……你方威胁要停止会议的态度，只能说明你方决心拖延，甚至破坏停战谈判。”
    我方已经明白声明，朝中方面决不向片面的蛮横无理的美方方案屈服。我方已为停战谈判竭尽了一切的努力，停战谈判中的下一步完全在于美方。
