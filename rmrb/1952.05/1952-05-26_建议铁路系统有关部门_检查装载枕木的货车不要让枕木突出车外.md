    Suggest Railway System Relevant Departments
    Check Freight Cars Carrying Railroad Ties to Ensure Railroad Ties Do Not Protrude Outside
    Comrade Editor: Recently, some trains carrying railroad ties have had ties protruding outside the cars due to excessive loading or improper methods. This is very dangerous. On April 30th, the 11342 freight train from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan had twelve ties protruding; on May 14th, the 11340 freight train also had three ties protruding; on May 13th, the 11332 freight train from Shanhaiguan to Tianjin had one tie protruding 800 millimeters when it reached near the bridge. Fortunately, it was discovered in time, otherwise, if the tie had caught on the bridge structure, a major accident would have occurred. If the ties protrude from the left and right, they can easily damage the cars; and they may also injure people on another train; if the ties fall from the front and rear, the train may be overturned. Therefore, I suggest that the railway system departments responsible for loading ties, the train conductors of trains carrying ties, and relevant personnel along the way should pay attention to strengthening inspections to prevent the ties from protruding and prevent accidents.

    建议铁路系统有关部门
    检查装载枕木的货车不要让枕木突出车外
    编辑同志：近来有些装载枕木的列车，因为装得过多或方法不当，致枕木突出车外。这是很危险的。四月三十日从天津开往山海关的一一三四二次货物列车，有十二根枕木突出来了；五月十四日一一三四零次货物列车，也有三根枕木突出来；五月十三日，一一三三二次货物列车从山海关开往天津，行至大桥附近时，有一根枕木突出八百公厘，当时幸被发现，不然枕木挂了桥架子，就会发生重大事故。因为枕木若从左右突出，容易挂坏车子；而且也可能击伤另一列车上的人；枕木若从前后掉下来，列车就有颠覆的可能。因此，我建议铁路系统装枕木部门，和装有枕木车的运转车长以及沿途有关人员，应注意加强检查，不让枕木突出，防止发生事故。  田树山　马济安
