    Northeast Focuses on Promoting Horse-Drawn Mechanical Farm Implements
    170,000 Sets of New Horse-Drawn Farm Implements to be Promoted Region-Wide in the Next Five Years
    This year, the Northeast People's Government Agricultural Department has begun to promote new horse-drawn mechanical farm implements in key areas of the Northeast countryside. This year, the region will first promote 500 sets of new farm implements and establish 48 promotion stations. According to the preliminary plan of the Northeast People's Government Agricultural Department: from 1953 to 1957, 170,000 sets of new horse-drawn mechanical farm implements will be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that all 137 million mu of flat cultivated land in Northeast China will use new farm implements; implement deep plowing and meticulous cultivation to change the crude old cultivation methods; a part of the remaining 47 million mu of mountainous and paddy fields will also adopt new farm implements for cultivation. The realization of this huge farm implement reform plan will rapidly advance agricultural productivity.
    The Northeast is one of the richest regions of our great motherland, with vast plains and fertile land, especially the vast plains of Heilongjiang and Songjiang, which are the famous "granaries" of the Northeast. Most farm households in these areas raise draught animals, mostly horses, followed by cattle and donkeys; farmers in the Heihe area near the Soviet Union already have experience in using new farm implements; at present, there are 4.8 million organized farm households in the Northeast, accounting for about 81 percent of the total number of farm households in the region, of which permanent mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives are about 100,000 (accounting for 25 percent of the organized households). If we calculate that one permanent mutual aid team or agricultural production cooperative uses one set of new farm implements, then about 100,000 sets of new farm implements can be promoted. These are favorable conditions for promoting new horse-drawn mechanical farm implements in the Northeast.
    The increasing development of industry in the Northeast has opened up a source for new farm implements. At present, the various farm implement factories under the Northeast Farm Implement and Pesticide General Factory have begun to manufacture new horse-drawn farm implements in large quantities. Each province has one or two provincial-run mechanical farm implement factories, and county-run farm implement factories are also very common. According to statistics from Heilongjiang Province alone, there are 23 such factories. Generally, they have equipment such as machinery, kilns, and foundries, and can undertake the repair of new farm implements and the supply of spare parts. In terms of raw material supply, the Northeast produces abundant iron, steel, and wood, which are cheap and convenient for transportation. These are favorable conditions for manufacturing new farm implements.
    In his report "Overcoming the Intrusion of Bourgeois Ideology into the Party and Opposing Right-Wing Ideas within the Party," Northeast People's Government Chairman Gao Gang pointed out: "To implement agricultural socialization, the primary task is to gradually change the current small-scale peasant economy into an economy of agricultural cooperatives. To develop the agricultural cooperative economy, in addition to further strengthening the education of peasants on socialism and collectivization, using the personal experience of peasants in running agricultural cooperatives well, and using the experience of governments at all levels in running state-owned farms well to educate peasants, it is also necessary to make peasants generally use new horse-drawn farm implements and some tractors in a planned manner within five or six years to change the past cultivation methods." This shows that the promotion of new farm implements plays a huge role in guiding peasants towards agricultural socialization.
    In order to gradually improve agricultural productivity, the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Northeast People's Government issued a call for the promotion of new farm implements in 1950, and the Northeast People's Government promulgated the "Decision on the Promotion of New Farm Implements." From that time on, the reform of agricultural production tools and the promotion of new farm implements became a major event in the entire Northeast region. There are two types of new farm implements being promoted in the region: one is various farm implements manufactured locally in the Northeast. Among these farm implements, the main focus is on manufacturing and promoting new plows and shovel cultivators to meet the needs of plowing and cultivating. A total of nearly 100,000 pieces have been manufactured and promoted in the past three years. The other is Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements. These farm implements include more than a dozen types such as double-wheeled single-furrow plows, double-wheeled double-furrow plows, spike-tooth harrows, disc harrows, rollers, seeders, harvesters, prime movers, and threshers; more than 600 sets, totaling more than 7,000 pieces, have been lent out in the past three years. The promotion targets are mainly state-owned farms and mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives with a good foundation in various provinces and counties. Since 1950, various parts of the Northeast have begun to pay attention to establishing promotion stations for new farm implements; in 1951, there were only nine such promotion stations in the region, but this year it has grown to 48. In 1950, there were only 39 mutual aid teams in the region that used horse-drawn farm implements, but in 1951, it increased to 104. Larger-scale farm implement promotion stations, such as the Hailun Agricultural Technology Promotion Station led by the Northeast People's Government Agricultural Department and the Jixian Promotion Station led by the Songjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, have people specially responsible for technical guidance, teaching agricultural technology to farmers, and enabling farmers to learn how to operate and install new farm implements, which has achieved great results.
    The new farm implement promotion stations that are currently responsible for technical guidance are the young buds of the cultivating stations that will promote and repair tractors in the future. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, the people of the Northeast have seen the dawn of agricultural mechanization. Within five or six years, on the fertile plains of the Northeast, there will be thousands of young men and women farmers operating new production tools for cultivation, greatly increasing agricultural productivity.

    东北重点推广马拉机械农具
    今后五年内全区将推广新式马拉农具十七万套
    今年东北人民政府农业部已开始在东北农村中有重点地推广新式马拉机械农具。今年全区首先推广新农具五百套，并建立推广站四十八个。根据东北人民政府农业部的初步计划：从一九五三年开始到一九五七年将有计划、有步骤地推广新式马拉机械农具十七万套，使全东北一亿三千七百万亩的平坦耕地，全部使用新式农具；实行深耕细作，改变粗糙的旧耕作方法；其余四千七百万亩山地和水田，也将有一部分采用新农具耕作。这一巨大的农具改革计划的实现，将使农业生产力迅速向前发展。
    东北是我们伟大祖国富饶的地区之一，有广大的平原和肥沃的土地，特别是黑龙江、松江一带的广大平原，是东北有名的“谷仓”。这些地区一般农家饲养的耕畜，最多的是马其次是牛、驴；靠近苏联一带的黑河地区的农民，早已有使用新式农具的经验；目前东北组织起来的农民已有四百八十万户，约占全区农户总数的百分之八十一，其中常年互助组和农业生产合作社约为十万个（占组织起来的户数的百分之二十五），如以一个常年互助组或农业生产合作社使用一套新式农具来计算，即可推广新农具约十万套。这是东北推广新式马拉机械农具的有利条件。
    东北工业日益发展，给新式农具开辟了来源。目前东北农具农药总厂所属各农具工厂，已经开始大量地制造新式马拉农具。各省都有一两处省营机械农具厂，县营农具厂也很普遍，仅就黑龙江省的统计，就有二十三处。一般的都有机械、烘炉、翻砂等设备，可以担负新式农具的修理和补充零件的任务。在原料供应方面，东北出产有丰富的钢铁和木材，价格便宜，运输方便，这是制造新式农具的有利条件。
    东北人民政府高岗主席在“克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想”报告中指出：“要实行农业社会化，其首要的任务就是逐步改变目前的小农经济为农业合作社的经济。而要发展农业合作的经济，除了进一步加强对农民关于社会主义和集体化的教育，用农民自己办好农业合作社的切身经验，并且用各级政府大量办好国营农场的经验教育农民外，还必须有计划地在五、六年之内，使农民普遍使用新式马拉农具和部分的拖拉机，改变过去的耕作方法。”这就说明，推广新式农具在引导农民走向农业社会化的过程中，是有巨大作用的。
    为了逐步提高农业生产力，中共中央东北局和东北人民政府在一九五零年就提出了推广新农具的号召，东北人民政府并颁布了“关于推广新农具的决定”。从这个时候开始，改革农业生产工具和推广新农具就成为东北全区的一件大事。在全区推广的新农具有两种：一种是东北当地制造的各式农具。在这类农具中，主要是制造和推广新式犁和铲趟机，以适应翻地和铲趟的需要。总计三年来共制造、推广将近十万件。另一种是苏联式马拉农具。在这类农具中，包括双轮一铧犁、双轮双铧犁、钉齿耙、圆盘耙、镇压器、播种机、收割机、原动机、脱谷机等十几种；三年来共贷出六百多套，计七千多件。推广对象主要是各省、县的公营农场和基础较好的互助组、农业生产合作社。从一九五零年起，东北各地就开始注意成立推广新式农具的推广站；一九五一年这种推广站在全区只有九个，今年已发展到四十八个。使用马拉农具的互助组，一九五零年全区只有三十九个，一九五一年就发展到一百零四个。规模较大的农具推广站，如东北人民政府农业部领导的海伦农业技术推广站及松江省农林厅领导的集贤推广站，都有人专门负责技术指导，把农业技术教给农民，使农民学会操纵和安装新农具，已收到很大的效果。
    目前担负技术指导任务的新农具推广站，就是将来推广、修理拖拉机的耕作站的幼芽。在中国共产党和人民政府领导下，东北人民已看见了农业机械化的曙光。五、六年内，在沃野千里的东北平原上，将会有成千成万的青年男女农民，操纵着新式生产工具从事耕作，使农业生产力大为提高。
