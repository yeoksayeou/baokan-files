Achievements in Labor Protection Work in the Past Two Years
　　Shi Huaibi
　　Thanks to Chairman Mao's boundless concern for the working class and the laboring people, the Central People's Government has, in the two years since its establishment, successively promulgated fundamental laws necessary for labor protection, such as the Trade Union Law, the Labor Insurance Regulations, the Measures for Relief of Unemployed Workers, the Instructions on Workers' Spare-Time Education, the Instructions on Establishing Factory Management Committees in State-Owned and Public-Owned Factories, the Instructions on Establishing Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings in Private Enterprises, and the Draft of Provisional Regulations on Factory Hygiene. These laws and instructions have played a huge role in protecting labor, greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and greatly promoted the economic construction of the New Democracy. According to the statistics of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at the end of 1951: the number of trade union members organized nationwide was 7,297,857. Industrial workers have been basically organized, of which 89% of railway workers have been organized; 91% of postal and telecommunications workers have been organized; 89% of textile workers have been organized; 68% of coal miners have been organized; and 88% of electricity workers have been organized. This is a great development in organization work since the promulgation of the Trade Union Law.

　　Improvement of Labor Protection Work
　　After the establishment of the Central People's Government, in order to protect the interests of the working class, it gradually changed the bad situation created during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and Japanese imperialism. At the same time, it criticized the thinking of "valuing machines, not people" that was common among the old management personnel of various factories and mines, especially in private enterprises, and vigorously carried out labor protection work. In the past two years, thanks to the concern of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government for the working class, as well as the active leadership of various industrial departments and the active efforts of the vast number of employees and the close cooperation of relevant departments, some achievements have been made in labor protection work.

　　In state-owned coal mines: after the Ministry of Fuel Industry put forward the call for safe production and various mines adopted pneumatic picks for coal mining and improved mechanical ventilation equipment, gas accidents were basically eliminated. The average percentage of mines using mechanical ventilation in Northeast, North China, and East China has reached 54.1% (40.6% in 1949); Northeast has increased to 84.4%; and the percentage of mines with zonal ventilation has increased to 55%. Waterproofing projects and transportation conditions have also been greatly improved.

　　In order to reduce workshop temperature and humidity, the textile industry has improved ventilation, spraying, and other equipment. In Shanghai, Tianjin, and Qingdao alone, 69 factories (including 49 private factories) have added 23,111 pieces of safety and hygiene equipment, and the temperature and humidity have generally decreased by 2 to 14 degrees.

　　In the harmful health departments of the state-owned chemical industry, the six-hour work system has been implemented quite universally, gas sealing has been strengthened, and health care systems have been established. Workers engaged in harmful health operations in state-owned factories can generally eat health care meals. In Fushun and Anshan alone, 63,854 people eat health care meals. In more than 30 larger private dye and acid-alkali enterprises in Shanghai, 17 have changed from a 10-hour or 12-hour work system to a three-shift system, and ventilation, dust removal, protection, and other equipment have also been preliminarily improved. In the Dalian State-Owned Chemical Factory, due to the improvement of the electric dust collector for tower sulfuric acid, the dust removal rate has increased to 95%, and the poisoning rate has decreased from 50.4% to 30.2%.

　　National railway system: In the Northeast, safety equipment has reached 90.3% of the required amount, and in Guannei (inside the passes), it has reached 58.6%. In 1951, more than 90 billion yuan was used for safety and hygiene equipment.

　　Due to the improvement of safety and hygiene equipment in factories and mines, casualties have been greatly reduced. The number of casualties in factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department has decreased year by year, and in 1951 it decreased by 20% compared with 1950. On the basis of the annual reduction in the number of casualties in coal mines nationwide, the monthly average number of injuries in the first half of 1951 decreased by 39.4% compared with the monthly average number of injuries in 1950, deaths decreased by 28.2%, and serious injuries decreased by 26.2%; the injury rate of employees in 1950 decreased by 57% compared with 1949, and in the first half of 1951 it decreased by 65.5% compared with the same period last year; comparing 1950 and 1949, the mortality rate decreased by 35%, and in the first half of 1951 it decreased by 75.2% compared with the same period in 1950.

　　Implementation of Labor Insurance
　　Before the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Northeast Regional Government first implemented the Wartime Labor Insurance Regulations in public enterprises in the Northeast in 1948. Cities such as Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Shijiazhuang, as well as industrial sectors such as railways, ordnance, iron and steel, postal and telecommunications, and coal mines, also successively implemented labor insurance. By the end of 1950, the number of people enjoying labor insurance nationwide had reached 1.4 million. After the promulgation of the Labor Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of China in February 1951, by March 1952, the number of people enjoying labor insurance in industrial and mining enterprises with more than 100 people had increased to more than 2.6 million, including the family members of employees, about 10 million people. In most enterprises with fewer than 100 people, collective contracts for the implementation of labor insurance have also been signed. In East China alone, more than 50,000 employees have signed such contracts.

　　According to incomplete statistics for the third quarter of 1951, public and private enterprises implementing labor insurance spent a total of 164.8 billion yuan on labor insurance expenses, of which 60.9 billion yuan was paid for sickness insurance, accounting for 36.9% of the total expenditure. 1,179,989 employees enjoyed this treatment. 10.9 billion yuan was paid for maternity expenses, accounting for 6.6%, and 44,341 female workers enjoyed this treatment. 1.9 billion yuan was paid for old-age pensions, accounting for 1.2%, and 6,193 people enjoyed this treatment. 5.9 billion yuan was paid for disability expenses, accounting for 3.6%, and 38,119 people enjoyed this treatment. 3.9 billion yuan was paid for non-work-related deaths, accounting for 2.4%, and 1,639 people enjoyed this treatment. 80.4 billion yuan was paid for collective labor insurance undertakings, accounting for 49%. A total of about 1.3 million employees and their families enjoyed the above benefits.

　　Collective labor insurance undertakings include spare-time sanatoriums, nutritional canteens, sanatoriums, recuperation centers, disability homes, and nursing homes, among which spare-time sanatoriums are the most common, because they do not delay employees' production, can improve employees' health, and are relatively cost-effective. In 1951, the Northeast People's Government allocated a special fund of 30 billion yuan to build and expand 79 spare-time sanatoriums in state-owned enterprises, with 3,800 beds. As of the end of 1951, there were 136 spare-time sanatoriums, 41 sanatoriums, and 14 nursing homes nationwide. In the Northeast alone, 28,000 employees enjoyed spare-time sanatorium treatment in 1951.

　　Due to the implementation of labor insurance, special difficulties such as birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability, which employees have always felt most painful and unable to solve, have been initially resolved. Through this fact, the class consciousness of the vast number of employees has been greatly improved, and they deeply understand that only under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party can their lives be continuously improved. Chen Desheng, an old worker at the Wuhan Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, said: "Labor insurance is more reliable than a son." Liu Zifeng, a worker at the Hunan Xikuangshan Mine, said: "In the era of the reactionaries, it was 'working until old age, and still three years of rice have not been earned'; there was only danger, how could one talk about insurance." Female workers responded: "We are no longer afraid of giving birth and unemployment. We would be letting down Chairman Mao if we don't work hard." Zhang Zhiliang, a worker at the Xi'an Huafeng Flour Mill, died of illness, and his wife shed tears when she received the relief money. Similar facts are too numerous to mention.

　　Workers' Wages Have Been Generally Increased
　　In the past two years, due to the government's stabilization of prices, workers' actual wages have been generally increased; at the same time, a system of calculating wages in kind has been implemented to protect the lives of employees. When adjusting wages, minimum wages and middle wages were appropriately increased, and the highest wages were maintained and could not be reduced (with the exception of individual special unreasonable cases). The wages of employees across the country have shown an upward trend since liberation with the development of production. For example, in the Northeast region, the average basic wage of employees in 1951 increased by 15.3% compared with 1950; the wage in 1951 increased by 260% compared with 1948. Another example is the Shanxi Steel Plant. Taking the highest wage of workers before liberation as 100, it was 155 in 1949 (the first year after liberation); 191 in 1950; and 280 in 1951.

　　In terms of reforming the wage system, state-owned factories and mines have gradually promoted the eight-grade wage system and the method of determining grades according to technical standards, and have stipulated reasonable industrial order. In addition, incentive systems for increasing production have been widely adopted, and the scope of piece-rate wages has been expanded. For example, in the Northeast region, by the end of 1951, workers receiving piece-rate wages had reached 43.5% of the total number of production workers. Their wage income increased by an average of 20%. The additional wages for cultural and welfare undertakings for employees paid by the state in proportion to the total wage fund increased by 30% compared with 1950.

　　Major Achievements in Relief Work for Unemployed Workers
　　The unemployment phenomenon left over from the Kuomintang's reactionary rule once tended to become serious in major cities in Guannei (except for the Northeast region) during March and April 1950, when industry and commerce encountered temporary difficulties. According to statistics, at that time there were 1,664,288 unemployed workers, semi-unemployed workers, and unemployed intellectuals across the country. In order to relieve these unemployed workers, the State Council of the Central People's Government quickly allocated 400 million catties of grain as unemployment relief funds and promulgated measures for relieving unemployed workers. Except for the Northeast region, unemployment relief committees were successively established in 108 cities in Guannei, actively carrying out the work of relieving unemployed workers. Due to the government's vigorous adjustment of industry and commerce and public-private relations, the situation of industry and commerce improved in July of the same year, and the unemployment situation gradually eased. In total, from May 1950 to the end of 1951, a total of 982,002 workers were placed in employment, including 124,230 who engaged in self-salvation through production; 122,259 who returned to their hometowns for production; and 735,513 who were placed in employment through referrals. In addition, with the development of national economic construction, there were also 333,785 people who voluntarily returned to their hometowns and found employment on their own and canceled their registration. By the end of 1951, there were only 348,501 unemployed workers in the country, and relief and resettlement are continuing.

　　The realization of the people's government's labor policy fully demonstrates the great superiority of the new democratic state system. The Chinese working class has truly understood from vivid facts that only under the leadership of its vanguard – the Communist Party – and its leader Chairman Mao can their lives be truly improved. Therefore, they have further brought into play their production enthusiasm and creativity and are striving for the country's industrialization and socialist future. According to statistics at the end of 1951, more than 80% of Chinese workers participated in patriotic production competitions, put forward 147,670 rationalization proposals for production, and produced 86,541 labor models.

　　两年来劳动保护工作的成就
    史怀璧
    由于毛主席对工人阶级和劳动人民的无限关怀，中央人民政府在成立二年多来，陆续颁布了工会法、劳动保险条例、救济失业工人办法、职工业余教育的指示、在国营公营工厂建立工厂管理委员会的指示、在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示及工厂卫生暂行条例草案等保护劳动的必要的基本法令。这些法令和指示，对保护劳动起了巨大的作用，极大地鼓励了工人阶级的生产积极性和创造性，大大地推进了新民主主义的经济建设事业。根据一九五一年年底中华全国总工会的统计：全国已组织起来的工会会员为七百二十九万七千八百五十七人。产业工人基本上已经组织起来，其中铁路工人已经组织起来的有百分之八十九；邮电工人组织起来的有百分之九十一；纺织工人组织起来的有百分之八十九；煤矿工人组织起来的有百分之六十八；电业工人组织起来的有百分之八十八。这是在工会法颁布后，组织工作上的一个很大的发展。
  劳动保护工作的改进情况
    中央人民政府成立后，为了保护工人阶级的利益，逐渐改变了在国民党和日本帝国主义的反动统治时期所造成的恶劣情况，同时批判了各厂矿旧管理人员中特别是私营企业中普遍存在的“重视机器，不重视人”的思想，大力开展了劳动保护工作。两年多来，由于共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府对工人阶级的关怀，以及全国各产业部门的积极领导、广大职工的积极努力和有关部门的密切配合，已使劳动保护工作获得一些成绩。
    国营煤矿方面：在中央燃料工业部提出安全生产的号召、各矿采取风镐采煤并改善了机器通风设备之后，即基本上消灭了瓦斯事故。东北、华北、华东地区采用机械通风的矿井平均已达百分之五十四点一（一九四九年为百分之四十点六）；东北则已增至百分之八十四点四；分区通风的矿井则已增至百分之五十五。防水工程、运输情况也都有了很大的改进。
    纺织工业部门为了降低车间温度和湿度，改进了通风、喷雾等设备。只上海、天津、青岛三市六十九个厂（其中有私营工厂四十九家），即增加安全卫生设备二万三千一百零一件，温度和湿度普遍降低了二度到十四度。
    在国营化学工业中的有害健康部门，已相当普遍地实行了六小时工作制，加强了气体密闭，并建立了保健制度。国营工厂从事有害健康作业的工人一般能吃到保健饭，只抚顺、鞍山两市吃保健饭的就有六万三千八百五十四人。在上海三十多家较大的私营染料和酸碱料企业中，已有十七家由十小时或十二小时工作制改为三班制，通风、吸尘、防护等设备，也有了初步的改善。大连国营化学工厂塔式硫酸由于电气除尘器的改善，除尘率已提高到百分之九十五，中毒率则由百分之五十点四降到百分之三十点二。
    全国铁路系统：在东北，安全装置已达到需要量的百分之九十点三，关内则达到了百分之五十八点六。一九五一年用于安全卫生设备的款项达九百多亿元。
    由于厂矿安全卫生设备的改善，已使伤亡事故大大减少。东北工业部门所属厂矿的伤亡人数历年都有减少，一九五一年又比一九五零年减少百分之二十。全国煤矿的伤亡人数，在历年减少的基础上，一九五一年上半年每月平均负伤数字又比一九五零年的每月平均负伤数字减少百分之三十九点四，死亡减少百分之二十八点二，重伤减少百分之二十六点二；一九五零年职工负伤率比一九四九年减少百分之五十七，一九五一年上半年又比上年同一时期减少百分之六十五点五；死亡率以一九五零年和一九四九年比较，减少百分之三十五，一九五一年上半年又比一九五零年同一时期减少百分之七十五点二。
  劳动保险的实施
    在中央人民政府成立以前，东北区地方政府就在一九四八年首先在东北公营企业中实行了战时劳动保险条例，天津、太原、石家庄等城市以及铁路、兵工、钢铁、邮电、煤矿等产业部门也相继实行了劳动保险。到一九五零年底止，全国享受劳动保险的人数已达一百四十万人。一九五一年二月中华人民共和国劳动保险条例颁布后，到一九五二年三月，在百人以上的工矿企业中享受劳动保险的人数增加到二百六十多万人，连同职工的家属计算在内，约有一千万人。在百人以下的多数企业中也签订了实行劳动保险的集体合同，单是华东一个地区，订立此项合同的职工，就有五万多人。
    根据一九五一年第三季度不完全的统计，实行劳动保险的公私营企业共支出劳动保险费用一千六百四十八亿元，其中支付疾病保险费用六百零九亿元，占总支出的百分之三十六点九，享受这种待遇的职工有一百一十七万九千九百八十九人。生育费支付了一百零九亿元，占百分之六点六，享受这种待遇的女工有四万四千三百四十一人。养老费支付十九亿元，占百分之一点二，享受这种待遇的人数是六千一百九十三人。伤残费支付五十九亿，占百分之三点六，享受这种待遇的人数是三万八千一百一十九人。非因工死亡费支付了三十九亿元，占百分之二点四，享受这种待遇的人数是一千六百三十九人。举办集体劳动保险事业支付了八百零四亿元，占百分之四十九。享受以上各项待遇的职工及其家属共约一百三十万人。
    集体劳动保险事业包括业余疗养所、营养食堂、疗养所、休养所、残废院、养老院等，其中尤以业余疗养所最为普遍，因为业余疗养所既不使职工耽误生产，又能增进职工的健康，而且开支费用比较节省。一九五一年东北人民政府曾拨专款三百亿元，在国营企业中增建和扩充业余疗养所七十九所，床位三千八百张。截至一九五一年底止，全国已有一百三十六个业余疗养所，四十一个疗养所，十四个养老院。仅东北一地在一九五一年就有职工二万八千人享受了业余疗养待遇。
    由于实行了劳动保险，职工从来最感痛苦而又无法解决的生、老、病、死、伤、残等特殊困难，已获得了初步的解决。通过这一事实，广大职工的阶级觉悟大大提高，他们深切地了解到：只有在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，生活才能得到不断的改善。武汉震寰纱厂老工人陈德胜说：“劳动保险比儿子还可靠。”湖南锡矿山工人刘自烽说：“在反动派时代是‘做工做到老，还有三年米冒（没）讨’；只有危险，那里谈得上保险。”女工们反应：“再不怕生孩子和失业了，要不好好干就对不起毛主席。”西安华峰面粉厂工人张志亮因病死亡，他的妻子领到救济费时感动得流泪。类似这样的事实是不胜枚举的。
  工人的工资普遍提高
    两年多来，由于人民政府稳定了物价，工人的实际工资已普遍提高；同时实行了以实物计算工资的制度，保障了职工的生活。在调整工资时，适当提高了最低工资和中等工资，并保持最高工资，不能降低（个别的特殊不合理的例外）。全国各地职工的工资在解放后随着生产的发展，表现了一直上升的趋势。例如东北地区的平均工资，一九五一年的职工基本工资比一九五零年提高百分之十五点三；一九五一年的工资比一九四八年增加了百分之二百六十。又如山西炼钢厂，以解放前工人最高工资为一百，则一九四九年（解放后第一年）为一百五十五；一九五零年为一百九十一；一九五一年为二百八十。
    在改革工资制度方面，各国营厂矿逐渐推行了八级工资制及按技术标准定等级的办法，并规定了合理的产业顺序。另外，还广泛地采用了提高生产的奖励制度，并扩大了计件工资的范围。如东北地区在一九五一年底，领取计件工资的工人已达到生产工人总数的百分之四十三点五。他们的工资收入平均提高了百分之二十。国家按工资基金总额比例支给职工的文化福利事业的附加工资，比一九五零年增加了百分之三十。
  救济失业工人工作的重大成就
    国民党反动统治遗留下来的失业现象，在一九五零年三、四月间，当工商业遇到了暂时困难的时候，除东北地区外，在关内，各大城市中曾一度趋于严重。据统计：当时全国各地共有失业工人、半失业工人及失业知识分子一百六十六万四千二百八十八人。中央人民政府政务院为了救济这些失业工人，迅速地拨粮四亿斤，作为失业救济金，并颁布了救济失业工人办法。除东北区外，关内先后在一百零八个城市成立了失业工人救济委员会，积极开展了救济失业工人的工作。由于政府大力调整工商业和公私关系，同年七月间工商业好转，失业情况逐渐缓和。总计从一九五零年五月到一九五一年年底，一共安置就业的工人有九十八万二千零二人，其中生产自救的十二万四千二百三十人；还乡生产的十二万二千二百五十九人；介绍就业的七十三万五千五百一十三人。此外，随着国家经济建设的发展，尚有自行还乡、自行就业注销登记的三十三万三千七百八十五人。到一九五一年年底全国仅有失业工人三十四万八千五百零一人，现在继续进行救济和安置中。
    人民政府劳动政策的实现，充分说明了新民主主义国家制度具有极大的优越性。中国工人阶级已从活生生的事实中，真正理解到唯有在自己的先锋队——共产党和自己的领袖毛主席的领导下，才能真正获得生活改善。因此，他们进一步地发挥了生产的积极性和创造性，为国家工业化和社会主义前途而奋斗。据一九五一年年底的统计，中国工人百分之八十以上参加了爱国主义的生产竞赛，提出了十四万七千六百七十个生产合理化建议；涌现了八万六千五百四十一位劳动模范。
