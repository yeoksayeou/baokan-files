"Pravda" Publishes Alexandrov's Article Exposing the Accomplice Face of the Red Cross "International" Committee

"Pravda" published an article by Alexandrov on April 29, exposing the face of the so-called Red Cross "International" Committee as an accomplice to aggression. Alexandrov wrote: Hundreds of millions of honest people around the world condemn the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea. The conscience of civilized people cannot tolerate such crimes. New facts and evidence are discovered every day proving that American interventionists are using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. The irrefutable facts revealed by the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the investigation teams of China and Korea, and journalists from various countries have torn off the masks of the American warmongers and fully confirmed the accusations against the American imperialists in the statements of North Korean Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai.

Alexandrov pointed out: The aggressors have realized that their position is in danger, so they are now resorting to all kinds of shameless sophistry and excuses to "save face," mislead public opinion, and deceive the people. But in doing so, the American ruling clique is only exposing its true face as an aggressor. Public opinion in various countries has already seen that although Acheson vehemently denies America's crimes, he does not say a word condemning bacteriological warfare, which is tantamount to admitting that he is the mastermind and supporter of bacteriological warfare. He has exhausted all means to prevent the United Nations Disarmament Commission from discussing the issue of banning bacteriological warfare. Alexandrov pointed out: In this regard, one fact cannot be ignored. As Xinhua News Agency of China pointed out, the United Nations Secretariat has continuously received countless letters and telegrams protesting against the United States' bacteriological warfare in Korea, but Lie is "deaf and dumb" to this. In particular, he has done everything possible to cover up the crimes of the United States in using bacteriological weapons with all possible excuses, and at the same time to collect intelligence for the United States on the effectiveness of such weapons. Xinhua News Agency said on this issue: Lie is becoming more and more obedient to his American masters.

Alexandrov said: Acheson is obviously afraid of a fair investigation of the facts, so he desperately clings to the so-called Red Cross "International" Committee, insisting that this "International" Committee should investigate the accusations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army. Alexandrov then described the essence of the Red Cross "International" Committee, its organizational members, and what these people have done in the past and present. He said: This so-called Red Cross "International" Committee is not an international organization at all. It is a private group composed of Swiss citizens, now with nineteen members, mainly big capitalists, big manufacturers, and big bankers who have close ties with foreign capital. For example, the honorary president of this Red Cross Committee, Huber, is such a person. The Huber family has been in control of the "Aluminum Industry" joint-stock company for 56 years. Huber himself was the chairman of this joint-stock company for many years and is now a member of the administrative council of this joint-stock company. In addition, Huber is also a director and administrative council member of many other joint-stock companies and insurance companies. The chairman of this committee, Ruegger, is an administrative council member of one of the largest insurance companies in Switzerland. Vice-Chairman Baud-Bovy-Naville has close ties with the German financial magnate Schuldeis-Reisberg, who is the administrative council chairman of eleven joint-stock companies in Switzerland. An important member of this Red Cross Committee, Burckhardt, is an administrative council member of a bank, one of the five largest banks in Switzerland, and an administrative council member of the Zurich Disaster Insurance Company. In addition, he is related to the Swiss Von Roll Iron Works.

The author wrote: Huber published a book in 1951 entitled "The International Committee of the Red Cross: Ideal and Reality." In this book, Huber said: "The committee is not a social institution established according to international law, but at most a simple group organized by no more than twenty-five Swiss citizens." This is very interesting.

The International Committee of the Red Cross also made the same confession in a booklet it published, confirming that the committee is only "a private group operating under Swiss law." In addition, it should be pointed out that this "private group" has recently been mainly funded by the United States and Britain. The committee's work report from January to September 1951 clearly illustrates this. Nearly three-quarters of all "voluntary" donations received by the committee came from the US-British bloc, and the vast majority came from the United States. Therefore, it is no accident that Acheson and his accomplices are in a hurry to use this Geneva "group" to help them cover up their crimes when the American aggressors encounter difficulties. Alexandrov emphasized: The Red Cross "International" Committee has a long and rich experience in its despicable work of assisting aggressors, covering up war crimes, and deceiving public opinion. The entire course of the so-called Red Cross "International" Committee during the Second World War clearly proves this. It is now known worldwide that not only during the Munich period, but even after the beginning of World War II, the US-British ruling clique tried to collude with Hitler against the Soviet Union. One of the leaders of the Red Cross "International" Committee, the aforementioned Burckhardt, played a particularly active role in arranging negotiations between the US-British imperialists and the Hitler bandits. As early as August 1940, he was the intermediary between the Hitler bandits and the representatives of the British government. All these attempts at collusion failed. But in 1942, the year the Western allies of the Soviet Union promised to open a second front, this activity was resumed. These new activities were again carried out through Burckhardt, who spared no effort to arrange meetings between Keiber, the British Consul General in Zurich, and Vanzell, a Hitlerite who was then the trusted agent of the German Navy in the Continental Oil Company.

The Red Cross "International" Committee has shown that it is a loyal servant of the aggressors—even in carrying out its direct so-called humanitarian duties. The whole world knows that the Hitler gang killed hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war, some of whom died from torture and torment, and some of whom died from artificial infections in bacteriological experiments. But the Red Cross "International" Committee did not "notice" this situation, and according to the committee's own statement, during the war, the committee's representatives conducted thousands of investigations of Hitler's prisoner-of-war camps. When the problem involves the mass slaughter of Slavic prisoners of war—primarily Soviet prisoners of war—by the Hitler gang, it is, of course, no accident that the "International" Committee cannot see it.

The author continued: After the American aggressors launched a war of aggression against the Korean people, they rushed to use the experience of the Red Cross "International" Committee in instigating aggression and covering up war crimes. In Tokyo, the chief representative of the committee at the US military headquarters was Leshgnir, who specializes in making "satisfactory reports" on the conditions of Hitler's concentration camps. The representative of the committee in South Korea is a man named Bieli. The "specialty" of Bieli and his friends is to turn a blind eye to the conditions of prisoner-of-war camps and prisons in South Korea.

Alexandrov said: The International Women's Investigation Team on the Crimes of the US-Lee Army in Korea submitted a report to the Red Cross "International" Committee, accusing the US military of the crimes it committed. This exposed the entire ugliness of the committee's shameful servility to the American aggressors. The committee immediately abandoned its much-touted rhetoric about how "humanitarian" its mission was and hurriedly declared that it had no right to investigate violations of international law. It even brought out the resolution it passed in 1939. However, for some reason, when Acheson realized that his situation was not good and asked the Red Cross "International" Committee to investigate the accusations of the United States conducting bacteriological warfare, it immediately forgot this resolution and expressed its willingness to conduct an investigation that would suit the wishes of its American masters. The author concluded: From all these facts, it is clear that the Red Cross "International" Committee is actually not an international organization at all. Democratic people and
ordinary honest people do not trust it. It is a docile tool of the US State Department, used to obey any order of its master and cover up any crime of its master, even if the horror of that crime is beyond description. It is relying on these things that Acheson and his accomplices are trying to start up this International Committee to deceive public opinion and use its "prestige" to cover up the crimes committed by American interventionists in Korea and China.

    “真理报”发表亚历山大罗夫的文章
    揭露红十字“国际”委员会的帮凶面貌
    “真理报”四月二十九日发表亚历山大罗夫的文章，揭露所谓红十字“国际”委员会的侵略帮凶的面貌。亚历山大罗夫写道：全世界千千万万正直的人民都谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜进行可恨的细菌战的滔天罪行，文明人民的良知是不能容忍这种罪行的。每天都有新的事实和证据发现，证明美国干涉者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团、中国和朝鲜的调查团以及各国记者所揭露的无可置辩的事实，都撕掉了美国战争贩子的假面具，并完全证实了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永和中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来两人的声明里对美帝国主义者的指责。
    亚历山大罗夫指出：侵略者已经意识到他们的地位处于危险，所以现在便采取种种不要脸的诡辩和推卸责任的藉口，想“挽回面子”，迷惑舆论并欺骗人民。但是，美国统治集团这样做，只是暴露了他们侵略者的真面目而已。各国的舆论都已经看到，艾奇逊虽然矢口否认美国的罪行，却没有一句话表示要谴责细菌战，这就无异承认了他是细菌战的主谋者和支持者。他用尽了一切办法，要阻止联合国裁减军备委员会讨论禁止细菌战的问题。亚历山大罗夫指出：在这方面，有一件事实不能忽略。正如中国的新华通讯社所指出的，联合国秘书处不断地收到无数抗议美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的函电，可是赖伊却对这“装聋作哑”。尤其是，他竭尽一切力量，以一切可能的藉口来掩饰美国使用细菌武器的罪行，同时并替美国搜集关于这种武器的效力的情报。新华通讯社在这问题上说：赖伊对他的美国主子是愈来愈顺从了。
    亚历山大罗夫说：艾奇逊显然害怕对事实进行公正的调查，因此就拚命地抓住所谓红十字“国际”委员会不放，硬说应该由这个“国际”委员会调查关于美国军队使用细菌武器的指责。亚历山大罗夫随后叙述了红十字“国际”委员会的本质、它的组织成员和这些人过去和现在的所作所为。他说：这个所谓红十字“国际”委员会根本不是什么国际组织。它是一个由瑞士公民组成的私人团体，现在有十九个委员，主要都是与外国资本有密切关系的大资本家、大制造商和大银行家。例如这个红十字委员会的名誉主席胡伯就是这样的人。胡伯家族五十六年来都在掌握着“制铝工业”股份公司。胡伯本人多年都是这个股份公司的董事长，现在是这个股份公司的行政理事会的理事。此外，胡伯又是其他许多股份公司和保险公司的董事和行政理事。这个委员会的主席吕格是瑞士某最大保险公司的行政理事。副主席鲍德麦—纳维尔和德国大金融资本家舒尔戴斯—赖斯堡有密切的关系，舒尔戴斯—赖斯堡是瑞士十一家股份公司的行政理事长。这个红十字委员会的重要委员布克哈特是瑞士五大银行之一的某银行的行政理事和苏黎世灾难保险公司的行政理事。此外，他又与瑞士丰乐尔冶金工厂有关。
    作者写道：胡伯在一九五一年出版了一本书，名叫“红十字国际委员会：理想与现实”。胡伯在这本书中说：“委员会不是一个根据国际法建立的社会机构，而是至多不过二十五名瑞士公民所组织的一个简单的团体。”这一点是很有意思的。
    红十字国际委员会在它出版的一本小册子中也作了同样的供认，它证实委员会只是“按照瑞士法律进行活动的一个私人团体”而已。此外还有一点可以指出的是，这个“私人团体”最近主要是靠美英的款项进行活动的。委员会的一九五一年一月到九月份工作报告清楚地说明了这一点。委员会所收到的全部“乐”捐，差不多有四分之三是来自美英集团的，而且绝大部分是来自美国的。因此，当美国侵略者遭遇困难的时候，艾奇逊和他的同伙便急忙利用这个日内瓦“团体”来帮助他们掩盖他们的罪迹，这并不是偶然的。亚历山大罗夫着重指出：红十字“国际”委员会在它帮助侵略者、掩盖战争罪行及欺骗舆论的卑鄙工作中，是有长期的丰富的经验的。所谓红十字“国际”委员会在第二次世界大战期间的全部行径清楚地证明了这一点。现在全世界已经知道，不仅在慕尼黑时期，甚至在第二次世界大战开始以后，美英统治集团曾力图与希特勒勾搭来反对苏联。在安排美英帝国主义者与希特勒匪徒之间的谈判方面，红十字“国际”委员会的一个领袖，即上述的布克哈特，曾起过特别积极的作用。还在一九四零年八月，他就是希特勒匪徒与英国政府代表间的中间人。这些进行勾搭的企图全都失败了。但在一九四二年，就是在苏联的西方盟国答应开辟第二战场的那一年，这种活动又重新进行起来。这些新的活动又是通过布克哈特进行的，布克哈特不遗余力地为英国驻苏黎世总领事凯伯与希特勒分子范茨尔安排会议，范茨尔是当时德国海军派在大陆石油股份公司的心腹代理人。
    红十字“国际”委员会已表明它是侵略者的忠实仆从——甚至在执行它的直接的所谓人道主义的职务的过程中都是这样。全世界都知道，希特勒匪帮杀害了成千上万的战俘，这些战俘有的死于酷刑和折磨，有的死于在细菌实验中进行的人为的传染病感染。但是红十字“国际”委员会没有“注意到”这种情况，而据该委员会自己发表的声明说，在战争过程中，该委员会的代表曾对希特勒战俘营进行过几千次调查。当问题牵涉到希特勒匪帮大批屠杀斯拉夫民族的战俘——首先是苏联战俘——这种事情的时候，“国际”委员会当然看不见，这原不是偶然的。
    作者接着说：美国侵略者在对朝鲜人民发动侵略战争以后，就赶忙利用红十字“国际”委员会怂恿侵略和掩饰战争罪行的经验。在东京，该委员会驻美军司令部的首席代表是列希尼尔，这个人专门会对希特勒集中营的情况作“满意的报告”。该委员会驻南朝鲜的代表是一个名叫毕埃立的人。毕埃立和他的朋友们的“特长”是对南朝鲜的战俘营和监狱的情况熟视无睹。
    亚历山大罗夫说：国际妇女对朝鲜美李军罪行调查团曾向红十字“国际”委员会提出一份报告，控诉美军所犯的罪行。这一来就把该委员会可耻地卑躬屈节为美国侵略者服务的全部丑恶暴露无遗了。该委员会立刻把它那曾经大吹大擂的关于它的使命如何“人道”的言论置诸脑后，赶紧声明它无权调查违反国际法的事情。它甚至于把它在一九三九年通过的决议也抬出来了。但是，不知道为了什么缘故，当艾奇逊发觉自己的事情不大好办，而要求红十字“国际”委员会出来调查对美国进行细菌战的指责时，它马上就忘记了这一项决议，满口表示它愿意进行投合它的美国主子的心意的调查。作者最后总结说：从所有这些事实看来，很明白，红十字“国际”委员会实际上根本不是什么国际组织，民主的人们和
    一般正直的人民对它是不信任的，它是美国国务院的百依百顺的工具，用来听从它主子的任何命令，掩盖它的主子的任何罪行，即使那种罪行的可怖已经无以复加。就是仰仗着这一些，艾奇逊和他的同伙才企图把这个国际委员会开动起来，好欺骗舆论，以它的“威信”来掩盖美国干涉者在朝鲜和中国犯下的罪行。    （新华社据塔斯社莫斯科电）
