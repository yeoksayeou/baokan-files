AP Reporter's Report from Busan

Admits US Forces Massacred Our Captured Personnel

Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 24th (TASS): According to an Associated Press dispatch from Busan, sick and wounded prisoners of war in the large "hospital camp" (i.e., Camp No. 10) in Busan were brutally massacred by Americans for resisting the atrocities and forced "screening" of the prisoner-of-war camp authorities.

The reporter pointed out that "in this prisoner-of-war camp, riots had been brewing continuously since April 16," and by May 20, the prisoner-of-war camp authorities decided to "take tough measures."

According to the reporter, "A battalion of infantry with combat experience was dispatched to the prisoner-of-war camp to reinforce the local guards. Tanks rumbled past outside the camp. The authorities told the prisoners of war that if they did not come out of the camp, they would not get food. Finally, the authorities told them that if they did not come out, the American troops would go in and drive them out."

The reporter continued: "About 1,100 of the 1,600 prisoners of war in the camp, sick or not, participated in the fighting. About 500 amputees fought very bravely."

The reporter cited some figures to refute the lies fabricated by the American side that the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were unwilling to be repatriated.

Lieutenant Postick, the camp commander, said: "The prisoner-of-war camp now has 5,500 prisoners, all of whom are pro-Communists." This means that all these people are demanding repatriation.

    美联社记者自釜山的报道
    供认美方屠杀我被俘人员
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：据美联社记者釜山消息，在釜山的大“医院营”（即第十号战俘营）内，伤病的战俘因反抗战俘营当局的暴行和强制“甄别”，惨遭美国人屠杀。
    记者指出，“在这个战俘营里，骚乱从四月十六日以来就不断地酝酿着”，到了五月二十日，战俘营当局决定“采取强硬手段”。
    据该记者说：“有战斗经验的步兵一个营开到了俘虏营，增援当地的警卫。坦克在营地外隆隆地开过。当局向战俘说，假如他们不走出营地来，他们就得不到东西吃。最后当局向他们说，假如他们不出来，美国军队就要开进去把他们赶出来。”
    该记者继续说：“营地内全部一千六百名有病或无病的战俘中，约有一千一百名参加了战斗。约有五百名被截去肢体的残废者打得非常勇猛。”
    那个记者引证了一些数字，驳斥了美国方面捏造的所谓朝中战俘不愿遣返的谎话。
    战俘营长官波斯蒂克中尉说：“战俘营现在有俘虏五千五百人，他们全都是亲共分子。”这就是说，这些人都要求遣返。
