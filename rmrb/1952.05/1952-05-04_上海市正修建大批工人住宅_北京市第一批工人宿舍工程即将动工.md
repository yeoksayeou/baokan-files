To implement Chairman Mao's instruction to solve the housing problems of workers in large cities in the coming years, the East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government are implementing a large-scale construction plan: to build a large number of workers' residences in Shanghai. The first batch will build 21,000 houses, which can accommodate more than 100,000 people, assuming an average of five people per household. Among them, 1,002 houses have been completed, and the others will be constructed in stages. The East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government have organized a Workers' Residence Construction Committee, with Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, concurrently serving as the Director, and Liu Changsheng and Fang Yi as Deputy Directors, to lead this huge construction project.

The 1,002 houses that have been completed are located near Caoyang Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai and are named "Caoyang New Village." The base area covers 200 mu. The public buildings in the village include cooperatives, clinics, hot water shops, public toilets, and public bathhouses. In the future, small vegetable markets, schools, and clubs will be added. The public bathhouse is divided into male and female sections, with two large pools for collective use and 13 small bathtubs and showerheads for individual use. The bathhouse can accommodate about 40 to 50 people at the same time. There are also small bridges and flowing water in the village, as well as cinder roads and stone roads that can accommodate ten people side by side, and street lights have been installed on the roads. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Garden Management Office has already planted flowers, grass, and shrubs on all the lawns in Caoyang New Village, and now the trees are sprouting tender green branches and leaves.

To better meet the needs of the workers, two houses will be built as models before the construction of the other nearly 20,000 workers' residences, and workers will be organized to visit and solicit their opinions extensively. (Xinhua News Agency)

The Beijing Municipal People's Government is actively preparing to build a large number of workers' dormitories, and the first batch of 15,000 rooms is about to officially begin construction. This is one of the achievements of Beijing workers' efforts to increase production and practice economy and the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns in the past three years. At present, the Municipal Construction Committee and the Construction Committees of various factories and mines have been established. The former is responsible for the unified command of the project, and the latter is responsible for presiding over the specific project. The drawings for the first batch of workers' dormitories have been designed after careful research by engineering personnel and repeated solicitation of workers' opinions. This project is designed based on the spirit of meeting the needs of workers and taking into account the country's financial and economic situation, so everything starts from the principle of economy.

The lack of housing for workers in Beijing is relatively serious. Many workers live too crowded or too far away. Some workers even have to walk more than 30 li to work, which affects production and the workers' lives and studies. Solving this problem will greatly improve workers' lives and improve production.

    上海市正修建大批工人住宅
    北京市第一批工人宿舍工程即将动工
    为了执行毛主席的在今后数年内要解决大城市内工人住宅问题的指示，华东军政委员会和上海市人民政府正在实施一个大规模的建筑计划——在上海市建造大批工人住宅。第一批建造二万一千户住宅，如果以平均每户五人计算，可容纳十万余人。其中一千零二户住宅已经落成，其他的也即将分期动工兴建。华东军政委员会及上海市人民政府已组织了工人住宅修建委员会，由华东军政委员会副主席曾山兼任主任委员，刘长胜、方毅任副主任委员，领导进行这一巨大的建筑工程。
    目前已经落成的一千零二户住宅，坐落在上海市西郊曹杨路附近，取名为“曹杨新村”。基地面积达二百市亩。村内的公共建筑，有合作社、诊疗所、热水店、公共厕所和公共浴室等，以后还要增建小菜场、学校、俱乐部等。公共浴室分男女两部，共有集体用的大池塘两个和单人用的小浴缸及淋浴的莲蓬头共十三处，浴室大约同时可容纳四、五十人洗澡。村内还有小桥流水，有可供十人并行的煤屑路和石块路，路上已接上路灯。上海市人民政府工务局园场管理处早已在曹杨新村所有的草坪上栽植了花草和灌木，现在树木正在抽着嫩绿的枝叶。
    为更好地适应工人的需要，其他近二万户工人住宅兴建时将先建造两宅作为模型，组织工人参观，广泛征求工人的意见。（新华社）
    北京市人民政府正积极准备建筑大批工人宿舍，第一批一万五千间的工程，即将正式动工。这是三年来北京工人努力增产节约和“三反”“五反”斗争胜利的成果之一。现在，市建筑委员会和各厂矿建筑委员会都已成立，前者负责工程的统一指挥，后者负责主持具体工程的进行。第一批工人宿舍的图样，经工程人员的苦心研究，并反复征求工人意见，已设计完毕。此项工程是依据解决工人需要并照顾国家财政经济情况的精神而设计的，因之一切都从节约原则出发。
    北京工人缺乏住房的情况是比较严重的，不少工人住得太挤或太远，有的工人甚至要走三十多里路上工，影响生产和工人的生活、学习。这问题的解决，对改善工人生活和改进生产将有很大作用。
