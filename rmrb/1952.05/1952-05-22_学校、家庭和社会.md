    School, Family, and Society
    The Soviet Teachers' Newspaper published an editorial on April 26th, outlining how schools should promote families and society to strengthen their emphasis on children's education. The summary is as follows:

    Schools play a decisive role in the communist education of children. But our Soviet families are also educating children together with the schools. This is why it is so important for teachers and parents to maintain close contact. Parents should be actively involved in school life, and they must be armed with knowledge to help them correctly raise their children, cultivate their character, and reasonably organize their children's homework and leisure time.

    In carrying out work with parents, the grassroots trade union organizations of teachers have the responsibility to provide effective assistance to school principals. The Presidium of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has instructed the trade union organizations of all middle and primary schools to be responsible for strengthening attention to students' family education, promoting daily interaction between teachers and parents, and widely carrying out educational propaganda among residents. In implementing this instruction, the trade union of each school can become the organizer of this great and effective work of popularizing educational knowledge among the broad masses of working people.

    It is very important to pay attention to ensuring that the work of the school's parent committee is carried out well. But the issue is not only limited to correctly selecting its members, the issue is also how to improve the enthusiasm of the parent committee members and use this enthusiasm in the most reasonable way. Wherever school principals and teachers are good at guiding the work of the parent committee, the parent committee will become their powerful assistant in the struggle to win excellent results for students, to strive for students' discipline, and to fully realize universal education.

    One of the tasks of the trade union in the school is to ensure that all teachers regard doing parental work as their most important responsibility. It should not be sufficient for the class teacher to know the parents of each of his students and to meet with individual parents as needed, inviting them to school for talks or visiting them; class or school-wide parent meetings should be held regularly, including the most important issues related to children's homework and the school's educational measures in the meeting agenda. The meetings should be conducted in such a way that parents do not feel constrained, giving them the opportunity to express their concerns and difficulties, and to exchange experiences in educating children.

    Caring for children is an important task of all trade unions without exception. The factory trade union committee of any enterprise should always help employees solve the problem of educating children, especially for widowed mothers, mothers with many children, and families of those who sacrificed or were disabled in the Patriotic War, special attention should be given to them.

    In many enterprises in Moscow, Gorky, Molotov, Ivanovo, Tula, and some other cities, full workshop employee meetings have been held more than once to discuss the education of children. Often, principals of some schools and the most authoritative teachers attend these meetings to make reports. They talk about the situation of teaching work, the number of students attending classes, and student discipline. Afterwards, representatives from the factory, male and female workers, that is, the parents of the students, speak. They raise issues that are very important and urgent for both schools and families. At these meetings, parents who care for and pay attention to their children often bravely and openly criticize those lazy parents who do not care about their children's studies and do not pay attention to their behavior on the streets and in public places.

    Educating the younger generation is a great undertaking of national importance. Under the leadership of the Party, all aspects of power in our society must be drawn in to actively participate in this work.

### 学校、家庭和社会

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    学校、家庭和社会
    苏联教师报四月二十六日发表社论，指出学校应如何推动家庭和社会来加强对儿童教育的重视。摘要如下：
    学校在儿童的共产主义教育中起着决定性的作用。但是我们苏联的家庭也在和学校一道，教育着孩子们。这就是教师和家长们经常保持密切接触所以显得那样重要的原因。应当吸引家长们积极参加学校生活，同时必须用知识来武装他们，帮助他们正确地教养自己的儿女，陶冶儿童的性格，合理地组织儿童们的家庭劳作和休息时间。
    在开展对家长的工作方面，教师基层工会组织负有给学校校长以有效帮助的责任。全苏工会中央理事会的主席团曾责成各中、小学校的工会组织负责加强注意学生的家庭教育，促进教师和家长的日常往来并在居民中广泛展开教育的宣传。在执行这一指示时，每一个学校的职工会都可以成为在广大劳动人民中普及教育知识这一巨大而有效工作的组织者。
    注意使学校的家长委员会的工作进行得很好，这是十分重要的事。但问题不仅限于正确选择它的组成分子，问题也在如何提高家长委员会会员们的积极性，并以最合理的方式来运用这些积极性。凡是在学校校长和教师善于指导家长委员会的工作的地方，那里的家长委员会也便会成为他们在争取学生的优良成绩，争取学生的纪律性和充分实现普及教育的斗争中的有力助手。
    学校中的工会所负的一个任务，就是要使所有的教师都能把做家长工作看作是自己的最重要的责任。不应满足于级任导师的能认识他的每一个学生的家长和依照需要的程度来会见各个家长，请他们到学校谈话或是访问他们；应当定期召集班的或全校性的家长会议，把有关儿童课业，有关学校的教育措施等最重要的问题包括在会议的议程中。会议应当这样进行，即应当使家长们不感到拘束，使他们有机会说出自己的疑虑和困难，并得以交换教育儿童的经验。
    关心儿童们，是各职工会毫无例外的一件重要工作。任何企业的工厂工会委员会都应当经常帮助职工来解决教育儿童的问题，特别是对于居孀的母亲，孩子很多的母亲，在卫国战争中牺牲和残废者的家庭，尤其应予以特别的注意。
    在莫斯科、高尔基、莫洛托夫、伊万诺沃、土拉和一些其他城市的很多企业中，曾不止一次地举行过全车间的职工会议来讨论儿童的教育问题。经常，有一些学校的校长和最有权威的教师出席这些会议做报告。他们谈到教学工作的情况，上课的人数和学生的纪律。其后即由工厂方面的代表、男工和女工，即学生的父母亲们发言。他们提出就学校和家庭来说都是非常重要和迫切的问题。在这些会议上，关怀和注意自己的孩子的家长们常常是勇敢地、公开地批评那些懒散的家长，他们不关心自己孩子的学习，不注意他们在街头和公共场所的行为。
    教育未成年的一代是一件伟大的具有全国重要性的事业。在党的领导下，我们社会中的各方面力量都必须被吸引来积极参加这一工作。
