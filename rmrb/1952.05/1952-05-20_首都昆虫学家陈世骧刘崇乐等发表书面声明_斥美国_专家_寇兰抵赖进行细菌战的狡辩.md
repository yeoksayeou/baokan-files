The capital's entomologists, Chen Shixiang, Director of the Entomology Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Liu Chongle, Professor and Head of the Entomology Department of Beijing Agricultural University; Feng Lanzhou, Professor of Parasitology at the Chinese Union Medical College; Zhu Hongfu, Deputy Director of the Entomology Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Zhao Zhensheng, Associate Professor of Parasitology at the Beijing University Medical College; Cao Ji, Technician at the North China Agricultural Research Institute; and Lu Baolin, Associate Professor of Entomology at the Beijing University Agricultural College, published a written statement listing irrefutable evidence, denouncing the U.S. imperialist's tool, "expert" Coulan's sophistry in denying the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and calling on honest American scientists to stop the U.S. government from continuing its crime of germ warfare. The full text of the written statement is as follows:

We, a group of entomological workers in China's capital—Beijing—have recently seen the talk given by U.S. Dr. Coulan in New York, which distorts the facts about the U.S. conducting germ warfare and slanders the Chinese people. Therefore, based on the conscience and sense of justice that everyone should have, and the spirit of seeking truth from facts that scientific workers should have, we cannot but refute it.

First of all, we should point out that the U.S. aggressors' continuous germ warfare in Korea and in Northeast China, Qingdao, and other places in our country is already an undeniable fact. The discovered germ bombs, germ-carrying insects, germ-carrying poisons, and the epidemics that should not have occurred but have already occurred—these facts are irrefutable.

However, Dr. Coulan, after seeing some photos, and only some photos, came to the conclusion that "none of these insects can carry germs." Indeed, according to general medical entomology textbooks, some of the insects scattered by U.S. planes in Korea and Northeast China are not mentioned. However, under artificial cultivation, especially in the U.S., which had thousands of scientists conducting research on methods of poisoning humans as early as World War II, many insects could be used as tools for spreading disease. Of course, it is not necessary to choose blood-sucking insects, because everyone knows that sucking blood is only one of the ways insects transmit disease. Nor is it necessary, as Dr. Coulan imagines, to inject germs into the insects' bodies to carry out germ warfare. We believe that the murderous experts in the germ warfare laboratories in Maryland, Mississippi, and other states in the U.S. would never be so stupid.

To illustrate the above facts, we can give a clear example, which is the flies mentioned by Dr. Coulan. We have identified them as flower flies belonging to the genus Hylemyia (S.I.), which were found in swarms on the snow or frozen ground in Korea and Northeast China after U.S. aircraft intrusions. These types of flies have never been considered a sanitary pest, but bacteriologists, after various tests, have fully confirmed that they carry the terrible anthrax bacillus and other germs. We don't know what Dr. Coulan thinks about this fact. We can also tell Dr. Coulan that your country's troops are not only using insects, but also using other things, even feathers, as tools for spreading disease. Because we have also isolated anthrax bacilli from the feathers dropped by your planes. Who would have thought that feathers would be used as weapons for killing people? The U.S.'s use of these insects, and even the feathers of birds, to replace commonly known medical insects, one of its intentions is undoubtedly to cover up its crimes, or to avoid our attention, which is enough to show how insidious and cunning it is.

From the facts mentioned above, it is clear that we cannot estimate germ warfare using ordinary textbook knowledge. For an entomologist like Dr. Coulan to be so dogmatic, we cannot help but think that he is distorting the facts, violating his conscience, and defending his government's inhumane crimes. This is a very regrettable thing.

Because Dr. Coulan does not understand the actual situation in the new China, he still uses his outdated impressions to casually guess about our sanitation situation. In fact, it is precisely because of our attention to sanitation work that the epidemics that the U.S. aggressors attempted to spread have not been able to spread widely. Dr. Coulan's frivolous attitude and unwarranted slander of our people is something we cannot remain silent about.

The highest purpose of science is to seek happiness for mankind. In the past hundred years, entomology's contribution in this regard has been particularly significant. Now, entomology is being used by warmongers as inhumane weapons for killing people. All scientists who sincerely advocate humanitarian justice and uphold the dignity of science feel extremely angry. Not only should they not participate in this kind of murderous work, but they should also persuade those who have participated in the work in the past to repent and turn back, and they should not come to defend the germ warfare with conclusive evidence. Therefore, we want to appeal to honest American scientists: immediately take effective measures to prevent your government from continuing to conduct germ warfare, otherwise, your government will be severely sanctioned by the just people of the world.

    首都昆虫学家陈世骧刘崇乐等发表书面声明
    斥美国“专家”寇兰抵赖进行细菌战的狡辩
    首都的昆虫学家中国科学院昆虫研究室主任陈世骧、北京农业大学昆虫系主任教授刘崇乐、中国协和医学院寄生科教授冯兰洲、中国科学院昆虫研究室副主任朱弘复、北京大学医学院寄生虫学科副教授赵振声、华北农业科学研究所技正曹骥和北京大学农学院昆虫学系副教授陆宝麟等，发表书面声明，列举无可辩驳的证据，痛斥美帝国主义的御用
    “专家”寇兰为抵赖美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战所作的狡辩，并呼吁美国正直的科学家阻止美国政府继续进行细菌战争的罪行。书面声明全文如下：
    我们，中国首都—北京—的一部分昆虫学工作者，最近看到了美国寇兰博士在纽约发表的谈话，对于美国进行细菌战的事实，发出了歪曲的同时又对中国人民加以诬蔑的论调，因此，我们本着每个人应有的良知和正义感，本着科学工作者应有的实事求是的精神，不能不加以驳斥。
    首先我们应该指出，美国侵略者在朝鲜及在我国东北、青岛等地连续地进行细菌战，已经是无可否认的事实。已经被发现的那些细菌弹，带菌虫子，带菌毒物以及不应该有而已经发生的疫病，这些事实都是无可抵赖的。
    但是，寇兰博士看到了一些照片，而且仅仅是一些照片之后，他就下了一个结论，说这些昆虫是“没有一种能够带病菌的”。诚然，根据一般医用昆虫教科书来说，有一些美国飞机在朝鲜以及我国东北地区撒布下来的昆虫，是没有被提到过的。可是在人工培养之下，特别是美国这样早在第二次世界大战的时候，已有几千个科学家在进行研究这种毒害人类的方法，许多昆虫都可能被利用作传播疾病的工具。当然不一定要挑选吸血的昆虫，因为谁都知道，刺吸血液不过是昆虫传播疾病途径之一而已。更无须乎像寇兰博士所想像的将疫菌注射入虫身，才能进行细菌战。我们相信美国马兰州、密西西比州等等研究细菌战实验室中的杀人专家们是决不会这样愚笨的。
    为了说明以上的事实，我们可以举一个明显的例子，就是寇兰博士所提到的那些蝇子。我们已经鉴定了它是属于Hylemyia（S．I．）属的花蝇，是朝鲜以及我国东北地区，在美国飞机侵扰之后，在雪面或冰冻的地面上成群发现的。这类蝇子从没有被认为是一种卫生害虫，但是细菌学家，经过各种的检验，已完全证实，它们带有可怕的炭疽杆菌和其他病菌。我们不知道寇兰博士对于这一件事实，作何感想。我们更可以告诉寇兰博士，你国的军队不但在利用昆虫，而且也在利用其他的东西，甚至羽毛，来作为传播疾病的工具。因为从你们飞机所投下的羽毛上，我们同样的分离出了炭疽杆菌。一个正常的人，谁能想得到羽毛也会被人用作杀人的武器呢？美国利用这些昆虫，甚至禽类的羽毛，来替代一般所熟知的医用昆虫，它的用意之一，无疑是在掩饰自己的罪行，或者来避免我们的注意，正足以说明它是何等的阴险和狡猾。
    从上面所说的那些事实，很清楚，我们是不能用平常一般书本上的见解来估计细菌战的，像寇兰博士这样的一个昆虫学家，竟会这样的武断，这使我们不得不认为他是歪曲了事实，违背了良知，在替他本国政府所做非人道的罪行作辩护，这是一件十分遗憾的事。
    由于寇兰博士不了解新中国的实际情况，仍旧用他陈旧的印象来随便猜测我们的卫生情形。其实正因为我们对于卫生工作的注意，才会使美国侵略者企图散布的疫病，没有能够扩大蔓延。寇兰博士以轻率的态度，对我们人民妄加诬蔑，这是我们不能缄默的。
    科学最高的目的是为人类谋幸福。近百年来昆虫学在这方面的贡献，尤为重大。现在昆虫学竟被战争贩子利用作违反人性的杀人武器，凡是衷心主张人道正义，维护科学尊严的科学家，都感到万分愤怒，不但自己不参加这种杀人的工作，还应规劝已往参加工作的人们悔过回头，更不该来替证据确凿的细菌战争作狡辩。所以我们要向正直的美国科学家呼吁：立即采取有效的方法，阻止你们政府继续进行细菌战争，否则，你们政府一定要受到全世界正义人民的最严厉制裁。
