Brief Commentary on Political and Legal Work

    Bureaucracy Must Be Eradicated

    Zhang Shunyou, a cart driver from Yuci County, Shanxi Province, ran back and forth between the provinces of Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar, visiting twenty-seven organizations, spending nearly half a year and traveling more than 15,000 li to report the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude. He encountered numerous obstacles, and only after he complained to the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was the matter resolved. This incident occurred during our people's vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the great "Three-Anti" movement, and cannot but attract our serious attention.

    This incident illustrates that within our political organs and people's organizations, there is indeed a group of extremely vile bureaucrats, whose bureaucratic style is far more egregious than we can imagine. They turn a blind eye to counter-revolutionary elements issuing false passes, changing their names, and engaging in sinful activities; they ignore whistleblowers on the pretext of "no letter of introduction" or "no materials," putting on bureaucratic airs, saying:

    "We don't handle it here," "Can't handle it," "Not able to handle it"; some even mocked the whistleblower, asking him to first "start a dispute" with the reported counter-revolutionary element. When the whistleblower followed their orders, they still said "Can't handle it." Even after the whistleblower repeatedly ran around to obtain letters of introduction and supporting materials, they still ignored it. They even withheld the letter of introduction. We must ask where this group of bureaucrats gets this power from? Do they have even a shred of intention to serve the people? If such a bureaucratic style is not thoroughly eradicated, we might as well abandon the revolution, which is absolutely unacceptable!

    This incident also illustrates that our many political organs and people's organizations lack a system for handling and processing cases of reporting and complaints from the people, or if there is a system, it is very chaotic. The GuiSui Municipal People's Court actually allowed an intern to handle the people's reporting cases, allowing him to arbitrarily speak and express attitudes on behalf of the People's Court! This intern dared to say absurdly, "I don't care whether it's counter-revolutionary or not," and when the whistleblower asked him to hand over the materials to the president of the court, he threatened: "You must take full responsibility for these materials!" Why was there no one to manage such a worker in the People's Court, allowing him to scare away the whistleblower? Similarly, is the Shanxi Provincial People's Government able to manage the Yuci County Public Security Bureau? Why did the Provincial People's Government twice introduce Zhang Shunyou to the County Public Security Bureau to resolve "this small matter," but the County Public Security Bureau refused to resolve it and still pushed it back to the Provincial People's Government? Is this a relationship that can be tolerated between upper and lower-level organs? If it is said that this was done wrong by lower-level cadres, then why don't their superiors inspect their work and allow them to handle it randomly? When the Fourth Section of the GuiSui Municipal Public Security Bureau finally escorted Song Yude, they even handcuffed the whistleblower; the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau also detained the whistleblower for two hours. What is the basis for this? Who ordered them to do this? From this, it can be seen how alarming the disorganization and lack of system in these organs has reached, and this must be thoroughly corrected.

    This incident also illustrates that our leadership organs and responsible cadres have not conducted policy education for lower-level staff. Many staff members not only regard the work they are responsible for as simple matters, but do not understand the great political significance of these tasks, nor do they understand how heavy and glorious a responsibility they bear to the people. They do not even fully understand what the great "Three-Anti" movement is supposed to oppose. Therefore, during the "Three-Anti" movement, they continue to treat the people with an intolerable bureaucratic attitude, and even use the "Three-Anti" itself as a shield to refuse to do things for the people. Among them, someone actually said, "We are currently carrying out the Three-Anti movement, so we have no way to solve it." What absurd words these are! Have the leading cadres of these organs conducted "Three-Anti" education for their staff? How was it conducted? What practical effects did it produce? These must be carefully examined.

    In order for the leading organs and cadres at all levels to deeply accept this lesson and eliminate the bad habit of bureaucracy, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after accepting Zhang Shunyou's complaint, immediately verified the basic facts by telephone, and sent people to conduct on-the-spot verification at relevant departments in various provinces and cities. It will also summon all personnel related to this case to the North China Bureau for inspection, in order to educate all leading cadres, which is completely correct and necessary. Now that the "Three-Anti" movement has entered the construction period, the leading organs in various places are about to conduct democratic make-up lessons, adjust institutions and personnel, abolish unreasonable systems, and establish reasonable systems. At such a time, it is necessary to seriously and thoroughly carry out criticism and self-criticism, fully promote democracy, inspect and eliminate all bureaucratic styles in the organs, and take necessary and decisive actions against serious and typical bureaucratic elements. This is very necessary for consolidating the achievements of the "Three-Anti" movement and promoting construction work in all aspects.

    政法工作简评
    必须肃清官僚主义
    山西省崞县赶车工人张顺有为检举反革命分子宋郁德，在绥远、山西、察哈尔三省间往返奔跑了二十七个机关，费时近半年，行程一万五千余里，遭遇了重重阻难，最后到中共中央华北局去控诉才得解决。这件事发生在我国人民大张旗鼓镇压反革命和伟大的“三反”运动期间，不能不引起我们严重的注意。
    这件事说明：在我们的政权机关和人民团体中，确有一批极为恶劣的官僚主义分子，他们的官僚主义作风的恶劣程度，远不是我们所能想像得到的。他们对于反革命分子开假路条、改名换姓、进行罪恶活动熟视无睹；对于检举者则藉口“没有介绍信”或“没有材料”而置之不理，大摆其官僚架子说：
    “我们这里不管”，“管不了”，“不能管”；甚至于戏弄检举者，要他和被检举的反革命分子先“起个纠纷”，检举者依照他们的命令做了，他们仍然说“管不了”。当检举者反复奔走取得了介绍信和证明材料之后，他们还是不管。甚至于把介绍信也给扣下了。我们要问问这一班官僚主义者从那里得来这种权力呢？试问他们还有一点点为人民服务的心意吗？对于这种官僚主义作风如不加以彻底铲除，我们就等于放弃了革命，这是万万不能的！
    这件事又说明：我们的许多政权机关和人民团体，对待和处理人民群众的检举和控诉等案件是缺乏制度的，或有制度而十分混乱。归绥市人民法院竟然由一个实习工作员去处理人民群众的检举案件，由他任意代表人民法院发言和表示态度！这个实习工作员胆敢荒谬绝伦地说“反革命不反革命我不管”，而在检举人要求他把材料交给法院院长的时候，他又用恫吓的语气说：“你对这些材料得负完全责任！”这样的一个工作员在人民法院里，为什么竟然没有人管他，而任他把检举者吓走了呢？同样，山西省人民政府究竟能不能管崞县公安局呢？为什么省人民政府两次把张顺有介绍到县公安局去解决
    “这点小事”，而县公安局竟拒不解决，仍推给省人民政府呢？这难道是上下级机关间可以容许的关系吗？如果说这是下级干部干错的，那么他们的上级领导者为什么不检查他们的工作，而一任他们胡乱处理呢？归绥市公安局第四科在最后押送宋郁德时，连检举者也给上了手铐；阳高县公安局也一并把检举者扣押了两个钟头。这又有什么根据呢？是谁命令他们这样做的呢？由此可见这些机关的无组织、无制度的情况达到了何等惊人的程度了，这是非彻底纠正不可的了。
    这件事还说明：我们的若干领导机关和负责干部对下级工作人员是没有进行政策教育的。有许多工作人员不仅把自己担负的工作看做简单的事务，不了解这些工作在政治上的重大意义，不了解自己对人民群众负有多么沉重而又是光荣的责任，他们甚至连伟大的“三反”运动究竟是要反对什么都不完全了解。因而在“三反”运动期间继续用不可容忍的官僚主义态度对待人民群众，甚至把“三反”本身也当成了拒绝为人民群众办事的盾牌。他们之中居然有人说“现正值开展三反运动，我们没办法解决”，这是何等荒谬的话！这些机关的领导干部曾经对工作人员进行过“三反”教育没有？怎么进行的？产生了什么实际效果？这些都必须加以认真的检查。
    中共中央华北局为了使各级领导机关和干部深刻接受这个教训，清除官僚主义的恶劣作风，在接受张顺有控告之后，立即用电话查对了基本事实，又派人前往有关省、市各部门进行实地查对，并将调集所有与此案有关的人员到华北局进行检查，借以对所有领导干部进行教育，这是完全正确的和必要的。现在正值“三反”运动转入建设时期，各地领导机关正将进行民主补课，调整机构和人事，废除不合理的制度，建立合理的制度。在这样的时候，认真地彻底地开展批评和自我批评，充分发扬民主，检查和扫除一切机关中的官僚主义作风，对严重的典型的官僚主义分子进行必要的果断的处理，这对于巩固“三反”运动成果和推进各方面的建设工作，是非常必要的。
