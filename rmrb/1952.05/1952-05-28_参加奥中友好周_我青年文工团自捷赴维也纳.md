Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 27th. After touring and performing throughout Czechoslovakia, our Youth Art Troupe, at the invitation of the Austrian Austria-China Friendship Week Preparatory Committee, left Prague for Vienna on the 25th. Leading Czech government officials, representatives from the Central Council of the Czechoslovak Trade Unions, and youth representatives were among those who saw them off at the station. After arriving in Austria, our Youth Art Troupe will perform in Vienna and other Austrian cities during the three-week Austria-China Friendship Week.

After performing in Prague, our Youth Art Troupe split into two groups on the 13th and performed more than 30 shows in major towns and cities in Czechoslovakia. The performance programs included songs, folk dances, classical opera, modern opera, and acrobatics. They were loved and respected by the working people of Czechoslovakia. Many towns and cities hung flags and lanterns for their performances, and the audiences were unprecedentedly crowded. In the famous resort of Tatra, the town has only 12,000 residents, but the troupe's performance attracted 24,000 people, including many who came from afar. In the mining city of Ostrava, miners celebrated the arrival of our artists, and their output that day exceeded the plan by 52 percent. In Prešov, a cultural and industrial city in eastern Slovakia, the working people of the city rushed to complete a new sports field originally planned for the Five-Year Plan, so that our artists could perform. After the performances in various places, our Art Troupe returned to Prague and performed again in Prague on the 24th. On the same day, all members of the troupe were invited to visit the Army Art Theater to watch the Czech-language dialogue version of "The White Haired Girl."

During the performance period of our Art Troupe in Czechoslovakia, major Czech newspapers published articles, reviews, and photos about our Art Troupe in prominent positions. "Red Right Newspaper" published an article praising the performance of our Youth Art Troupe, saying: "After watching the performance of Chinese young artists, our working people have gained indelible impressions and great discoveries. The great Chinese nation has a rich culture and outstanding artistic achievements. The cultural and artistic traditions of thousands of years of history and the multi-faceted genius of the people have been combined to form a solid foundation for the development of Chinese culture and art from the folk."
