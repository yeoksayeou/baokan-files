    Our Great Motherland
    Xinjiang Province's first collectively-run farm, the "Dihua Collective Farm," was established on February 12th of this year. By late February, over 430 peasant households, totaling more than 1,300 people, had signed up to join the collective farm. These were mostly poor, landless, or land-poor peasants of various ethnicities from Dihua city and its suburbs. This is a picture of the peasants joining the collective farm. They are riding in carts prepared by the collective farm, moving towards the farm.
