The Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan (Shitai) railway realignment project is actively underway. The staff of the Shitai Railway Realignment Project Office and tens of thousands of laborers are striving to rebuild the old Shitai Railway into a straight, new Shitai Railway by the end of this year.

A large amount of coal and iron produced in Shanxi Province is mostly transported from the Shitai Railway. However, the old Shitai Railway has many curves and steep slopes, making it impossible for large locomotives to run, let alone pull more and run faster. The old line can no longer meet objective needs. To meet the needs of economic development, the state has invested a large amount of funds to improve the Shitai Railway.

The staff of the Shitai Realignment Project Office, in order to respond to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and economy, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, and under the principle of "saving money without affecting the quantity and quality of the project," repeatedly conducted investigations and research, revised the original project plan, and saved 24.5 billion yuan in this year's project expenses.

How could so much project funding be saved? Mainly because, during the "Three-Anti" movement, the bourgeois ideology of some engineering and technical personnel was criticized, and they revised the engineering design to make it more scientific. In the past, some engineering and technical personnel did not proceed from reality when designing projects, blindly copying standard drawings from countries such as the United States and Britain, pursuing appearance, and not emphasizing practical results, thus inflating the design budget. When designing tunnel projects, they liked to use reinforced concrete. After investigation, it was discovered that some tunnel projects could be completely replaced with stone. Some areas along the Shitai Railway had no water inside the mountains, and the tunnels did not require drainage. However, in the original design, there were drainage facilities. Simply modifying this design saved 100 million yuan per tunnel. The originally designed retaining walls rigidly adopted the standard of a 33-degree angle of repose for the soil. After testing, it was found that a 40-degree angle of repose could also be used, which reduced many project costs. Based on the current and possible future changes, modifications were also made to the original design of the station equipment project. In the past, waiting rooms and toilets in stations were designed using the same standard, which was actually not appropriate. The roof tiles for building houses could be completely made of red clay tiles, but some projects used cement tiles, which were more than twice as expensive as red clay tiles. During the "Three-Anti" movement, this extravagant and wasteful bourgeois ideology of engineering and technical personnel was criticized, and they switched to red clay tiles, thereby saving costs.

Many engineering and technical personnel failed to fully utilize the capacity of existing equipment and did not see the strength of the working masses, which also caused a lot of waste. In the past, when designing, they did not utilize the existing heavy rails and insisted on purchasing new heavy rails. Now, by using the old heavy rails from the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, a lot of money has been saved. In the past, when improving bridge projects, they did not study how to utilize the potential of the original bridge equipment, but invariably wanted to replace them with new bridges. Now it has been decided that as long as the bridge does not affect driving speed and driving safety, it will not be replaced. The original plan was to rebuild a certain steel beam bridge, which would have cost more than 1 billion yuan, but now it has been changed to reinforcement, which only costs more than 100 million yuan.

After the "Three-Anti" movement, the class consciousness of the working masses has generally improved, and production efficiency has also increased. Some technical personnel did not see this change when designing and still used old labor rates. Actual conditions have proven that old labor rates are not applicable and hinder the production enthusiasm of workers. The material consumption rates used in the past were also very backward. For example, for black explosives used to blast hard rock, the past rate was consistently 0.4 kg per cubic meter, but now only 0.25 kg is needed. For example, the past consumption rate for rubble was always set at 10%, but in reality, it should be below 5%.

During the "Three-Anti" movement, some engineering and technical personnel criticized bourgeois ideology, and their awareness has improved. They said, "If we don't change our minds, the hindrance to national construction will be even greater." They took the initiative to go deep into the field, investigate the situation, and conscientiously revise the original design, reducing project costs. Therefore, they were able to save the country 24.5 billion yuan within the originally planned project expenses. Hong Li, head of the engineering and technical section, said, "If Chairman Mao had not led us in the 'Three-Anti' struggle and criticized bourgeois design ideas, we would never have been able to save the country so much money."

    石太线改线工程费用为什么能节省二百四十五亿元？
    张敬光、范承义
    石（石家庄）太（太原）线改线工程，正在积极进行中。石太线改线工程处的职工和上万的民工，正在争取在今年年底，把旧石太线改建为平直的新石太线。
    山西省出产的大量煤、铁，多半从石太线运出。但是，旧的石太线弯道多，坡度大，不能行驶大型机车，更不能多拉快跑。旧线路已经不能满足客观的需要。为了适应经济发展的需要，国家投入大量资金，来改善石太线。
    石太改线工程处的职工，为了响应毛主席的增产节约的号召，在“三反”斗争胜利的基础上，在“省下钱而不影响工程的数量和质量”的原则下，反复地进行调查研究，修正了原来所订的工程计划，在今年的工程费内节省了二百四十五亿元。
    怎样能够节省这样多的工程费呢？主要是因为在“三反”运动中，某些工程技术人员的资产阶级思想受到了批判，他们把工程设计修改的更加科学了。过去，某些工程技术人员设计工程时，不从实际出发，盲目地抄袭美英等国的标准图，追求外表，不重实效，因而把设计预算做大了。在设计隧道工程时，他们喜欢使用钢筋混凝土。经过调查之后，才发现有些隧道工程，完全可以用石料来代替。石太线某些地区的山内并没有水，隧道不需要排水。但在原设计中，却都有排水的设备。仅仅修改了这种设计，每个隧道就节省了一亿元。原来设计的御土墙，死板板地采用了土壤安息角三十三度的标准，经过试验，知道四十度的安息角同样能用，这就减少了许多工程费用。根据现实的和将来可能变化的情况，对于原设计的车站设备工程也作了修改。过去设计的车站候车室、厕所，都采用相同的标准，实际上是不应该采用一个标准的。建筑房屋用的屋瓦，完全可以用红陶瓦。但某些工程，却用了洋灰瓦。而洋灰瓦比红陶瓦的价格高了一倍多。在“三反”运动中，工程技术人员的这种铺张浪费的资产阶级思想受到了批判，他们改用了红陶瓦，因此，节省了费用。
    许多工程技术人员，不能充分地利用现有设备的能力，看不见工人群众的力量，也造成了许多浪费。过去，他们进行设计时，不利用旧有的重轨，偏偏要购买新的重轨。现在改用了旧的同蒲线南段的重轨，节省了大量的费用。过去改善桥梁工程，不研究怎样利用原桥梁设备的潜在能力，却一律要更换新的桥梁。现在决定：只要桥梁不影响行车速度和行车安全，就一律不换。原计划要重建某钢梁桥，需要十亿多元，现在改为加固，只需要一亿多元就够了。
    在“三反”运动之后，工人群众的阶级觉悟普遍提高，生产效率也跟着提高。某些技术人员进行设计时，没有看到这个变化，还采用旧的工率。实际情况证明：旧工率是不适用的，是妨碍工人生产积极性的。过去采用的料率也是非常落后的。例如开坚石用的黑炸药，过去一贯是每公方用零点四公斤。但现在只用零点二五公斤就行了。又如过去订立片石消耗率时，总订为百分之十，实际应在百分之五以下。
    在“三反”运动中，某些工程技术人员批判了资产阶级思想，他们的觉悟提高了一步。他们说：“再不换脑筋，对国家建设的妨碍就更大了。”他们主动地深入现场，调查情况，认真地修改了原来的设计，缩减了工程费用。因此能在原订的工程费用内，节省国家资金二百四十五亿元。工程技术科科长洪力说：“要不是毛主席领导我们进行‘三反’斗争，不批判资产阶级的设计思想，我们决不能给国家省出这么多资金。”
