Column: Letter Excerpts

    The Museum on Museum Road in Shanghai still retains the color of imperialist cultural aggression. Many of the specimens inside are mainly explained in English, and more than six-tenths of the specimens have no Chinese explanations. Even when Chinese explanations are present, they are mostly inappropriate, such as referring to all Chinese people as "Hua Ren" (Chinese), which is a completely imperialist tone. In addition, the specimen descriptions in the museum also contain places that ridicule our people and insult our ethnic minorities, and there are many things that should be changed but have not been, such as "Korea" and "Manchuria." It is hoped that relevant departments will quickly inspect and correct these issues.

    上海博物院路的博物院应检查纠正错误的标本说明
    上海博物院路的博物院至今还残存着帝国主义文化侵略的色彩，里面的许多标本仍以英文说明为主，十分之六以上的标本没有中文说明。就是有中文说明，也大多不恰当，如把中国人民都称为华人，这是十足的帝国主义者的口吻。此外，该院标本说明中，还有嘲笑我国人民和侮辱我国少数民族的地方，还有许多应该改而没有改正的，如“高丽”、“满洲”等等。希望有关部门迅速检查纠正。
