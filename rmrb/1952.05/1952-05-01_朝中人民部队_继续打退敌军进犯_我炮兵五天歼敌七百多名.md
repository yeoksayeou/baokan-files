Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 30th: Our front-line correspondent reports: The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army repulsed more than ten small-scale enemy incursions in the five days from the 21st to the 25th. Our infantry units, guarding strong positions, often repelled invading enemy troops with fierce firepower, and ambushed the enemy in transit. On the 24th, a platoon of enemy troops that sneaked into the Naefong-dong area north of Tieyuan was suddenly attacked by an ambush unit of our army, suffering heavy casualties and retreating southward. In the Gaoyangdae area southeast of Saknyong, a team of enemy troops advancing towards us was also ambushed by our army en route.

Our artillery units continue to kill and wound enemy troops with accurate bombardment. In these five days, more than 700 enemy troops were killed or wounded by our artillery fire. On the 23rd alone, our artillery fire killed or wounded 308 enemy troops and destroyed five enemy tanks.

    继续打退敌军进犯
    我炮兵五天歼敌七百多名
    【新华社朝鲜前线三十日电】本社前线记者报道：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在二十一日至二十五日的五天中，打退了敌军十多次小股进犯。守卫在坚固阵地上的我军步兵部队，常常用猛烈火力击退进犯的敌军，并以伏兵袭击行进中的犯敌。二十四日窜至铁原以北内丰洞地区的一个排敌军，便遭到我一支伏击部队的突然攻击，伤亡大半，向南溃退。在朔宁东南高阳岱地区，一队向我进犯的敌军也在途中遭到我军伏击。
    我炮兵部队不断以准确的轰击杀伤敌军。在这五天中，死伤在我炮火之下的敌军达七百多名。仅二十三日一天中，我军炮火即毙伤敌军三百零八名，并击毁敌战车五辆。
