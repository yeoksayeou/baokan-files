    Cultural Briefs
    ▲ The Central Ministry of Culture's Educational Film and Tool Manufacturing Plant has produced 120 sets of lantern slides in the past two years. To welcome the "June 1st" International Children's Day, in addition to reprinting previous productions such as "New China's Children," "Happy Soviet Children," "Young Guerrillas of Anzhou Coal Mine," "My Name is Zheng Desheng," and "Little Yan Has Improved" to supply to various regions for Children's Day screenings, it has recently abridged two Soviet children's educational cartoon films: one is "The Story of the Swan," and the other is "The Heart of a Hero." In addition, "Chicken Feather Letter" has been abridged and made into a set of lantern slides. These lantern slides all have strong storytelling elements and are of great inspirational and educational significance for children, and will be available in large quantities in late May. The Educational Film and Tool Manufacturing Plant also plans to focus on screenings in Beijing during the "June 1st" holiday.
    ▲ The winter literacy campaign in Southern Jiangsu has ended. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 1,887,000 farmers participated in winter literacy classes and people's schools in Southern Jiangsu in 1951, more than double the 800,000 in 1950. Currently, 921,000 farmers have transitioned to year-round study, accounting for nearly 49 percent of the total number of winter literacy students, more than doubling the 390,000 students in people's schools last year. Yixing County, which has a relatively large number of people's schools, has an average of 1.1 people's schools per administrative village; in Meicun District of Wuxi County, with 83 administrative villages, there is an average of 1.7 people's schools per village. In Qingpu and Fengxian counties, the number of farmers participating in year-round study accounts for 35 percent of the agricultural population of each county.
