    Shuangliao County Cooperative Society, Liaoxi Province
    Should Not Dump Soybean Seeds on the Market
    To the Editor: Our Shuangliao County Grain Company in Liaoxi Province, in order to support spring ploughing production by farmers and supply farmers' seed needs, specially transferred 30 tons of carefully selected soybean seeds from Changbei County and sold them all to the Shuangliao County Cooperative Society at the listed price of 1,735 yuan, asking them to resell them to the farmers. However, they only allocated a little more than ten tons to the rural cooperatives, and dumped the rest on the market at a high price of 2,100 yuan per catty. This not only fails to meet the needs of farmers, but also affects market prices and violates the cooperative's management policy. Therefore, the business section chief of our company has repeatedly pointed out to the Shuangliao County Cooperative Society that this is wrong, but it has not attracted their attention. I believe that the Shuangliao County Cooperative's practice of proceeding from a purely profit-making point of view and disregarding the interests of the masses is a serious mistake, and they should conduct a profound self-examination.

### 辽西省双辽县合作总社  不应在市场上抛售大豆种籽

    辽西省双辽县合作总社
    不应在市场上抛售大豆种籽
    编辑同志：我们辽西省双辽县粮食公司，为了扶助农民春耕生产，供应农民种籽需要，特由昌北县调来三十吨精选过的大豆种籽，全部按牌价一千七百三十五元卖给双辽县合作总社，请他们转售给农民。但他们只拨给农村社十多吨，其余都以每斤二千一百元的高价在市场上抛售。这不但不能满足农民的需要，而且影响了市场的物价，违反了合作社的经营方针。为此，我公司业务股长曾一再向双辽县合作总社指出，这样作是错误的，但仍没有引起他们的注意。我认为双辽县合作社从单纯营利观点出发，不顾群众利益的作法是严重的错误，他们应作深刻的检讨。
