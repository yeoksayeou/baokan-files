    Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles
    Continuously Increase Labor Productivity
    The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article by Dubinin, a worker at the "Red Viborgets" factory in Leningrad, on April 29th, entitled "Continuously Increase Labor Productivity." The abstract is as follows:
    Socialist competition has long become a regular method of our work. On the one hand, we compete, and at the same time, we consolidate labor discipline, improve our production technology and skills, and expand the connection between science and production. All of these can help continuously increase labor productivity and increase the wealth of the great socialist motherland.
    Socialist competition has become our common and cherished cause, a powerful lever for improving labor productivity. All of the labor achievements of the Soviet people are linked to the development of socialist competition.
    Our factories are increasingly equipped with the latest highly productive machines and improved equipment year by year. In the factory, many new technologies and modern equipment plans have been adopted in the last three years alone. In the past three years, the factory has contributed more than 13.5 million rubles of above-plan savings to the state.
    Our Party organization leads the struggle for technological progress. For example, when the Party organization popularized the experience of innovators, it helped all foundry workers master the method of rapid smelting, and by this method, the time for smelting steel was almost halved.
    The adoption of new technologies has presented a new task for all factory staff. This new task is to improve their knowledge, perfect their skills, and improve production culture. Only under this condition can labor productivity be systematically improved.
    The creative cooperation between scientific workers and producers plays a pivotal role in the struggle to improve labor productivity. One of the most prominent forms of this cooperation is the comprehensive working group. In Leningrad alone, more than 3,000 scientists, nearly 9,000 engineers, and more than 26,000 workers participate in this type of working group.
    Friendship with scientific workers broadens the horizons of producers and enhances their inventive genius.
    Our factory has adopted 943 rationalization proposals in the past three years alone. The creative ideas of workers and engineers have helped save more than 5 million rubles. The cooperation between scientific workers and producers is one of the outstanding phenomena of the Stalin era.
    Improving labor productivity is inconceivable without constantly improving the economic and technical leadership of production, and without the coordinated work of all production links.

    Strive for High Labor Discipline
    The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article on April 21st by Viesielov, a technician in the foundry of the Ilyich Factory, discussing the experience of the Ilyich Factory in striving for and consolidating high labor discipline. The abstract is as follows:
    In the summer of 1918, Comrade Lenin came to our factory. It was a difficult and severe day. The young Soviet Republic was defending its survival in a difficult struggle against enemies at home and abroad where there was a disparity of forces. Ilyich told us: Now that we have driven away the capitalists and started working for ourselves, the most important thing is discipline and organization. He called on us to work in a new way and improve labor productivity.
    The Party called on all of us to sincerely and to the best of our ability fight for high labor discipline.
    Unfortunately, there are still cases of violation of labor discipline in our factory. I believe that the social organizations in our factory—the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League social organizations—have not paid enough attention to the education of all factory staff.
    An attitude of indifference towards young workers, towards their needs and their education, can damage production. Is it difficult to talk to young people about factory work? In fact, if this is done, they will cherish their factory and can become very good workers.
    Conscious labor discipline does not come by itself. In order to cultivate this discipline, it is necessary to constantly care for workers and care for the improvement of their labor and living conditions.
    Consolidating labor discipline is inconceivable without a high level of production culture. Comrade Stalin taught that in order for workers to work effectively, improve labor productivity, and improve the quality of products, it is necessary to create good conditions.
    The opinion of all factory staff is closely related to the consolidation of labor discipline. When a lazy worker feels that everyone is supervising him, and feels that his shameful behavior has aroused the anger of his comrades, he will begin to consider his behavior.
    In the struggle to improve labor discipline, propagandists, speakers, wall newspaper editors, and worker correspondents should play the most important role. In our foundry, a satirical newspaper was published not long ago. It is beneficial to work and has achieved great success. Sharp caricatures and sharp poems of idlers and those who violate labor discipline have gained wide response among workers.
    The Party of Lenin and Stalin teaches that the success of the cause of communist construction relies first and foremost on the communist consciousness of the working people and on the high labor discipline of the workers.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    不断地提高劳动生产率
    苏联真理报四月二十九日发表了列宁格勒的“红色维包尔日茨”工厂工人杜比宁的论文：“不断地提高劳动生产率”。摘要如下：
    社会主义竞赛早已成为我们工作的经常方法。我们一方面竞赛，同时巩固着劳动纪律，提高自己的生产技术和技巧，扩大科学与生产的联系。所有这些都能帮助不断提高劳动生产率和增加伟大社会主义祖国的财富。
    社会主义竞赛已成为我们共同的亲爱的事业，成为劳动生产率提高的强有力的杠杆。苏联人的一切劳动成就，都是与社会主义竞赛的发展联系着的。
    我们的工厂逐年增多地装备上最新的具有高度生产效能的机器和完善的装置。工厂里仅在最近三年之中，就采用了许多新技术和装备现代化的方案。在最近三年中，工厂把一千三百五十万以上的卢布的超计划的积蓄贡献给了国家。
    我们的党组织领导着争取技术进步的斗争。例如，党组织普及革新者的经验时，帮助全体铸造工人掌握了快速熔炼的方法，并以此方法把熔钢的时间几乎缩减了一半。
    采用新技术，给全厂工作人员提出了一个新的任务。这个新任务就是提高自己的知识，使技巧完善起来，提高生产文化。只有在这个条件下才能够有系统地提高劳动生产率。
    科学工作者和生产者的创造性的合作，在争取劳动生产率提高的斗争中有举足轻重的作用。这种合作最鲜明的形式之一就是综合性的工作小组。在列宁格勒一地就有三千多科学家，近九千个工程师和二万六千多工人参加了这种工作小组。
    与科学工作者的友谊扩大了生产者的视野，提高了他们的发明天才。
    我们工厂只在最近三年之中就采用了九百四十三件合理化建议。工人和工程师的创造思想帮助减省了五百万以上的卢布。科学工作者与生产者的合作是斯大林时代卓越的现象之一。
    提高劳动生产率如果没有经常改善对生产的经济方面和技术方面的领导，如果没有全部生产环节的调协一致的工作，是不可思议的。
    争取高度的劳动纪律
    苏联真理报四月二十一日刊载了伊里奇工厂铸造间技
    师维谢洛夫的论文，论述伊里奇工厂争取和巩固高度劳
    动纪律的经验。摘要如下：
    一九一八年夏天，列宁同志来到我们工厂。当时是一个困难的、严酷的日子。年轻的苏维埃共和国在与国内外敌人进行力量悬殊的、艰巨的斗争中保卫着自己的生存。伊里奇告诉我们：现在，当我们赶走了资本家并开始为自己工作的时候，最重要的就是纪律和组织性。他号召我们以新的方式来工作和提高劳动生产率。
    党号召我们全体人员真诚地、尽其所能地为高度劳动纪律而战斗。
    可惜，在我们工厂里仍有破坏劳动纪律的情形。我认为，我们工厂的社会团体——党的、工会的和青年团的社会团体——还没有充分注意对工厂全体人员的教育工作。
    对于青年工人，对于他们的需要和他们的教育漠不关心的态度，会给生产带来损害。难道和青年们倾心谈谈工厂工作是一件困难的事吗？实在说来，如果这样做的话，他们会爱护自己的工厂，可以成为很好的工人。
    自觉的劳动纪律不会自己来的。为了培养这个纪律，必需经常关怀工人，关怀他们的劳动和生活条件的改善。
    巩固劳动纪律，没有高度的生产文化是不可思议的。斯大林同志教导说，为了使工人可以有成效地工作，提高劳动生产率和改善生产品的质量，需要创造好的条件。
    工厂全体人员的舆论与劳动纪律的巩固，有着密切的关系。当懒散的工人感到全体人员监督他的时候，感到他的可耻的行为引起了同志们的愤怒的时候，他会开始考虑自己的行为的。
    在争取劳动纪律的斗争中，鼓动员、宣传员和壁报的编辑和工人通讯员应当起着最重要的作用。在我们铸造间里，不久以前出版了一种讽刺性的报纸。它对工作是有利的而且获得很大成就。对于懒汉和破坏劳动纪律的人的锐利的讽刺画和尖锐的诗，在工人中间获得了广泛的反应。
    列宁、斯大林的党教导说，共产主义建设事业的成功，首先依靠劳动人民的共产主义的觉悟，依靠工人的高度的劳动纪律。
