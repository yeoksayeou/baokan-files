    Two Medical Staff Members of Xiehua Hospital's Self-Criticism
    Editor: We are nurses at Xiehua Hospital (Mental Hospital). On the night of March 18th this year, because patients Gong Yuncheng, Zhang Zhijian, and Zheng Fangkun did not go to sleep on time, we resorted to improper means and slapped them three a few times. Afterwards, we concealed this matter, which fully demonstrates our lack of a spirit of service to the patients. After education from the organization and criticism from the masses, we deeply feel that this is a violation of work discipline and an infringement of human rights, and should be severely punished. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, we also apologize to comrades Gong Yuncheng, Zhang Zhijian, and Zheng Fangkun, and guarantee that we will never commit similar errors in the future.

    协华医院两个医务人员的检讨
    编辑同志：我俩是协华医院（精神病院）的护理员。今年三月十八日夜间，因病员宫云成、张志坚、郑方坤不按时睡眠，我俩竟不择手段地打了他们三人几掌。事后我俩还隐瞒着这件事，这充分说明我俩缺乏为病员服务的精神。经过组织的教育和群众的批评，我们深深觉得，这是违反工作纪律、侵犯人权的行为，应当受到严厉的处分。我俩除作深刻检讨外，并向病员宫云成、张志坚、郑方坤三同志道歉，保证今后决不再犯类似错误。
