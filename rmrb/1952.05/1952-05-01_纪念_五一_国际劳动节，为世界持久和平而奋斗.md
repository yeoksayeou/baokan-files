　　Commemorating International Labor Day: Striving for Lasting World Peace

　　International Labor Day, the great festival of solidarity and struggle for working people around the world, arrives in a new situation. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world attach even greater importance to the historical significance of this great festival and our important tasks in the current situation.

　　More than a hundred years ago, Marx and Engels first put forward the solemn call to "Workers of all countries, unite!" in the "Communist Manifesto." This fighting call has illuminated the path of struggle for the working class and all working people around the world for more than a hundred years. Since the working class worldwide designated May 1st of each year as a festival of solidarity and struggle in 1889, the face of the world has undergone fundamental changes in the past sixty years.

　　As we commemorate this year's International Labor Day, the people of the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the great Stalin, are victoriously building a communist society; the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of our country and the people's democratic countries are leading the people of their respective countries in building and consolidating the people's democratic system; the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, unites the peace-loving people of all nationalities around the world, and is carrying out unyielding struggles against imperialist aggression and to defend world peace. The Soviet Union, our country, and the people's democratic countries have all achieved great victories in domestic construction and in the cause of defending peace; the workers' movement and the national liberation movement around the world, and the peace movement of the broad masses of the people in various countries, are developing vigorously; the Chinese and Korean people together have opposed the war of aggression against Korea launched by US imperialism, and have achieved a great victory, making it impossible for the US aggressors to continue their offensive, thus making a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue possible. The current international situation is clearly increasingly favorable for the peace-loving people of the world to smash all the conspiracies of imperialist aggressive war, in order to win and defend lasting world peace. Recently, on March 31st, Stalin's reply to the questions raised by a group of American newspaper editors pointed out the direction of development of the current international situation.

　　As everyone knows, the current international tension is entirely created by the imperialist countries, especially the aggressive bloc of US imperialism. As early as February 1951, Stalin pointed out in his conversation with a reporter from Pravda: "In the United States, Britain, and France, there are aggressive forces eager for a new war. They need war in order to obtain super-profits, in order to plunder other countries. These are the fabulously rich people who own millions and billions, who believe that war is a profitable thing that generates huge profits." According to official materials from the United States, Britain, and France, the net profits obtained by the monopoly capitalists of the military industry in these countries in recent years have increased tenfold to fifteenfold compared with before World War II. For the shameful purpose of pursuing huge profits, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, and blatantly violated international law by waging a heinous bacteriological war against the Chinese and Korean people. For the same shameful purpose, US imperialism has stepped up the arming of Japan and West Germany, and forced capitalist countries to step up their arms expansion and war preparations, launching a cruel offensive against the living standards of the people of capitalist countries, and suppressing the workers' movement and the national liberation movement. These extremely few millionaires and billionaires, in order to pursue profits, must make many countries expand their arms and prepare for war, and in order to make many countries expand their arms and prepare for war, they must create an atmosphere of international tension by all means.

　　However, this policy of the imperialists is bound to fail. The result of US imperialism's desperate external aggression is only to further expose its fundamental weaknesses of insufficient military strength, too long battle lines, and transportation difficulties. The Korean War has told the world that US imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. The US imperialist policy of establishing military bases in various countries and controlling various countries has made many capitalist countries, including Britain, and colonial and semi-colonial countries feel threatened. The US imperialist policy of using Japan and West Germany as bases of aggression and rearming Japan and West Germany has been opposed by the people of the world, as well as by the people of Japan and West Germany. US imperialism's conclusion of a unilateral peace treaty with Japan, attempting to turn Japan into a US colony, has aroused the opposition of the people of China, the Soviet Union, India, Burma, the Pacific countries, and even the Japanese people. America's war preparations have greatly reduced the living standards of the people of the United States, Britain, and France, and the heavy tax rates have reached such a degree that US tax revenue accounts for 36 percent of national income, and Britain accounts for 45 percent. The US economic blockade policy against socialist and new democratic countries has not caused difficulties for the socialist Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, but has instead caused serious economic and financial crises in capitalist countries. The organized resistance of the working people and the colonial people in these countries is growing. Huge waves of strikes have swept through all capitalist countries. According to official US statistics alone, the average number of strikers in the five years after the war was twice as high as in the period between the two world wars; and the current development of the workers' strike movement in capitalist countries has caused great unease among the ruling classes of these countries. In colonial and dependent countries, especially in the Near East, the Middle East, and North Africa, national liberation movements are surging. In some colonial countries, the people's struggle has developed into open armed struggle, forming regular people's armies and large-scale guerrilla forces; in some dependent countries, the people are fighting for national freedom, independence, and the right to a democratic life. The broad masses of people of all oppressed nations are increasingly closely integrating their struggle against imperialism and for national liberation with the struggle of the people of all countries in the world to defend peace. The number of people in the world who have signed the World Peace Council's declaration for the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact has reached more than 600 million, forming a powerful force against imperialist aggressive war and defending world peace.

　　The strength of the countries in the peace and democracy camp is growing, making the imperialists dare not rashly launch a new world war. The over-fulfillment of the great postwar Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union and the brilliant achievements of communist construction projects have made the Soviet Union's national strength even more invincible. The people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe have made significant achievements in the cause of building socialism. The level of industrial production in these countries in 1951 was one to three times higher than before the war. The recent International Economic Conference in Moscow, with representatives from 49 countries participating, played a role in developing trade between countries and breaking the US imperialist blockade and embargo policy. Our Chinese people have achieved significant victories in the three major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and land reform; after carrying out the struggle against corruption and theft among our people, we have further consolidated and developed our victory. Facts have proven that striving for lasting world peace not only conforms to the interests of the people of the countries in the peace and democracy camp, but also conforms to the interests of the people of capitalist countries. The people of the world are further uniting to oppose the criminal plan of the American imperialists to prepare for a new war. The era when the imperialists could do whatever they wanted has long passed. The powerful force of the countries in the world peace and democracy camp, centered on the unbreakable unity of the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union, and the people of the world, is the guarantee of lasting world peace.

　　From this, it can be understood why the editors of American newspapers asked "Is the Third World War closer now than it was two or three years ago?" And Stalin's answer was "No, it is not." When the imperialist aggressive camp is in a deep and expanding crisis, it will inevitably become weaker and weaker and head towards a dead end; the peace and democracy camp and the forces of the people of the world are uniting and growing unprecedentedly, and it will inevitably move from victory to victory. Isn't this an extremely obvious truth? Based on the same fact, the governments of capitalist countries are bound to fail if they want to launch a war, while the peace and democracy camp and the people of the world love peace and oppose aggression. Therefore, peaceful coexistence of different social systems is naturally possible. "On what basis is the coexistence of capitalism and communism possible?" Stalin's answer is: "If there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then the peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is entirely possible." When the Chinese people and the people of the world read Stalin's reply to the questions raised by the American newspaper editors, they were a hundred times more confident in the victory of the struggle to defend the cause of peace.

　　In commemorating this year's "May Day" International Labor Day, our country's working class and all the people, under the banner of our people's great leader Mao Zedong, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, will continue to work hard to resist US aggression and aid Korea, consolidate national defense, carry out patriotic sanitation and epidemic prevention campaigns, eliminate US imperialist bacteriological warfare, and smash all the conspiracies of imperialism to prepare for a new war. Internationally, we will further strengthen the unity of our country with our great ally the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, strengthen the unity with the working class and the broad masses of people in other countries around the world, strive for lasting world peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and develop equal and mutually beneficial international economic and trade relations. Domestically, we must further consolidate the people's democratic united front led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and on the basis of the victory in the struggle against corruption and theft, universally carry out the patriotic production increase and thrift campaign, and further build our great motherland.

　　In commemorating this year's "May Day" International Labor Day, representatives of our heroic Chinese People's Volunteers Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea, combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army, model workers, agricultural production models, model workers in political, economic, and cultural work, and representatives of minority nationalities, are participating in the commemorative ceremony and are receiving the respect and warm welcome of the people. The World Federation of Trade Unions and the trade union organizations of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, Germany, Vietnam, India, Sweden, Denmark, Burma, Ceylon, Australia, Britain, and Iran have accepted the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and sent delegations to our country to participate in the commemorative ceremony. The Czechoslovak government delegation, the Burmese cultural delegation, and the Indian cultural delegation, which came to our country at the invitation of our Central People's Government, also participated in this commemorative ceremony. Mr. and Mrs. Fage and Mr. and Mrs. Roa, famous figures in French cultural circles, and Mr. Banfi, Mr. Visconti, Mr. De Santis, and Mr. Panizzi, famous figures in Italian cultural circles, who came to our country at the invitation of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, also participated in this commemorative ceremony. Representatives from Vietnam, India, Burma, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Argentina, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, France, Mexico, and Venezuela, who attended the Moscow International Economic Conference, also came to our country to visit and participate in this commemorative ceremony. The Korean People's Delegation, representing the heroic Korean people, gathered in Beijing to participate in the commemorative ceremony after visiting various parts of our country. The Hungarian National People's Art Troupe, which came to our country to perform and was warmly welcomed by our people, also participated in this commemorative ceremony. These representatives from various countries with different social systems gathered in our country's capital on this great festival, symbolizing the desire for peaceful cooperation between the working class of all countries and the peace-loving people of all countries.

　　Our people commemorate this year's "May Day" International Labor Day with infinite joy and victorious confidence. On this day, we should not only celebrate our existing great victories, but also further mobilize all our strength to invest in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and increase production and practice economy, and make more and greater contributions to the sacred cause of defending and building our motherland, and to the cause of opposing imperialist aggression and striving for lasting world peace.

### 纪念“五一”国际劳动节，为世界持久和平而奋斗

　　纪念“五一”国际劳动节，为世界持久和平而奋斗
    “五一”国际劳动节，这个全世界劳动人民团结斗争的伟大节日，在新的形势下来临了。中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都更加重视这个伟大节日的历史意义，和在当前形势下我们的重大任务。
    一百多年以前，马克思和恩格斯就在“共产党宣言”上第一次提出“全世界无产者联合起来”的庄严号召。这个战斗的号召，百余年来一直照耀着全世界工人阶级和一切劳动人民的斗争道路。自从一八八九年全世界工人阶级规定了以每年五月一日为团结斗争的节日，迄今六十多年了，世界的面貌已经发生根本的变化了。
    在我们纪念今年“五一”国际劳动节的时候，苏联的人民在伟大的斯大林的领导下，正在胜利地建设着共产主义社会；我国及人民民主各国的共产党和工人党，正领导各国人民，建设和巩固着人民民主制度；以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，团聚着全世界爱好和平的各民族人民，为了反对帝国主义的侵略、保卫世界和平而进行着不屈不挠的斗争。苏联、我国及各人民民主国家，在国内建设事业中，在保卫和平事业中，都取得了极大的胜利；全世界的工人运动和被压迫民族的解放运动，各国广大人民保卫和平的运动，都在蓬勃地发展；我国人民和朝鲜人民在一起，反对美帝国主义所发动的侵朝战争，取得了伟大的胜利，使美国侵略者不再有继续进攻的能力，因而使朝鲜问题的和平解决有了可能。目前的国际形势显然日益有利于世界爱好和平的人民去粉碎帝国主义侵略战争的一切阴谋，以争取并保卫世界的持久和平。最近，在三月三十一日，斯大林对美国的一批报纸编辑所提出的问题的答复，就指明了目前国际形势发展的方向。
    人们都知道，目前国际的紧张局势，完全是帝国主义国家，特别是美帝国主义的侵略集团所制造的。斯大林早在一九五一年二月对真理报记者的谈话中就已经指出：“在美国、英国以及法国，有着侵略的势力渴望新的战争。他们需要战争以便获得超额的利润，以便劫掠其他国家。这些人就是那些财产以百万和亿万计的豪富们，他们认为战争是产生巨大利润的有利可图的事情。”依照美、英、法各国官方的材料，这些国家军事工业的独占资本家，近年来所得的纯利竟比第二次世界大战前增加了十倍到十五倍。为着他们追逐巨额利润的可耻目的，美帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，并公然破坏国际公法，向中朝人民进行万恶的细菌战。为着同样的可耻目的，美帝国主义者加紧武装日本和西德，并迫使资本主义各国加紧扩军备战，向资本主义各国人民的生活水准举行残酷的进攻，压迫工人运动和被压迫民族的解放运动。这些极少数的财产以亿万计的富翁们，为要追逐利润，就要使很多国家扩军备战，为要使很多国家扩军备战，就要以一切方法制造国际间的紧张空气。
    然而，帝国主义者的这种政策是一定要失败的。美帝国主义拚命向外侵略的结果，只有更加暴露它的兵力不足、战线太长、运输困难的根本弱点。朝鲜的战争告诉了全世界：美国帝国主义者不过是一只纸老虎。美帝国主义在各国建立军事基地和控制各国的政策，使许多资本主义国家，包括英国在内，和殖民地半殖民地国家，普遍感受了威胁。美帝国主义以日本和西德为侵略基地，重新武装日本、武装西德的政策，受到全世界人民的反对，也受到日本与西德人民的反对。美帝国主义与日本订立片面和约，企图把日本变为美国的殖民地，引起中国、苏联、印度、缅甸、太平洋各国人民以至日本人民的反对。美国的备战政策使美、英、法等国人民生活极度降低，苛重的税率达到这样的程度：美国的税收占去了国民收入的百分之三十六，英国占百分之四十五。美国对社会主义和新民主主义各国的经济封锁政策，并没有给社会主义的苏联和各新民主主义国家造成困难，反而使资本主义各国发生经济的和财政的严重危机。这些国家的劳动人民和殖民地人民有组织的反抗正日益增长。巨大的罢工浪潮在所有的资本主义国家中掀起了。仅据美国官方的统计，战后的五年期间与两次世界大战之间的这个时期比较，美国每年平均罢工的人数就增加了两倍；而目前资本主义各国工人罢工运动的发展，更使这些国家的统治阶级感到极大的不安。在殖民地和附属国内，特别是在近东、中东和北非各国，民族解放运动风起云涌。有些殖民地国家，人民的斗争已经发展为公开的武装斗争，组成了正规的人民军队和大规模的游击部队；有些附属国的人民正为民族的自由独立和民主生活的权利而斗争。一切被压迫民族的广大人民正把他们反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的斗争，和世界各国人民保卫和平的斗争日益紧密地结合起来了。世界各国人民，在世界和平理事会争取缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签名的人数，已达六亿以上，形成了反对帝国主义侵略战争、保卫世界和平的强大力量。
    和平民主阵营的各国力量正日益增强，使帝国主义不敢贸然发动新的世界战争。伟大的苏联战后五年计划的超额完成和共产主义建设工程的光辉成就，已使苏联的国力更加强盛无敌。东欧人民民主各国在建设社会主义的事业中有了重大的成绩，这些国家的工业生产水平，在一九五一年已比战前提高了一倍到三倍。最近在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议，有四十九国代表参加，对于发展各国间的贸易、打破美帝国主义的封锁禁运政策起了作用。我们中国人民在伟大的抗美援朝、镇压反革命、土地改革等三大运动中取得了重大的胜利；在我国人民内部进行了反贪污、反盗窃的斗争之后，就更加巩固和发展了我们的胜利。事实证明，为世界持久和平而奋斗，不仅符合于和平民主阵营的各国人民的利益，而且也符合于资本主义各国人民的利益。全世界人民正在进一步联合起来，反对美国帝国主义者准备新战争的罪恶计划。帝国主义者为所欲为的时代早已过去了，以中苏两大国的牢不可破的团结为中心的世界和平民主阵营各国及全世界人民这个强大的力量，是世界持久和平的保证。
    由此可以理解，为什么美国报纸的编辑们问“第三次世界大战现在比两三年前更临近了吗？”而斯大林的回答是“不，不是这样。”当着帝国主义侵略阵营正处于深刻的和更加扩大的危机中的时候，它就必然越来越弱而走向穷途末路；和平民主阵营和全世界的人民力量，正在空前地团结和壮大起来，它就必然要从胜利走向胜利。这不是极明显的道理吗？基于同样的事实，资本主义各国政府要发动战争就必然失败，而和平民主阵营及全世界人民是爱好和平反对侵略的，那末，不同的社会制度的和平共存自然是可能的了。“在什么基础上资本主义与共产主义的共存才是可能的？”斯大林的回答是：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那么资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”中国人民和全世界人民读到了斯大林对美国报纸编辑们所提问题的答复，都百倍地加强了为保卫和平事业而斗争的胜利信心。
    在纪念今年“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我国的工人阶级和全体人民，在我国人民伟大领袖毛泽东的旗帜下，在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导之下，将继续努力抗美援朝，巩固国防，开展爱国防疫卫生运动，扑灭美帝国主义细菌战，粉碎帝国主义准备新战争的一切阴谋。我们在国际上将进一步加强我国和伟大的盟友苏联及人民民主各国的团结，加强和全世界其他各国工人阶级和广大人民的团结，争取世界的持久和平及各国人民间的友好合作，发展平等互利的国际经济贸易关系。在国内，我们要更加巩固以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线，在反贪污、反盗窃斗争胜利的基础上，普遍开展爱国增产节约运动，进一步建设我们伟大的祖国。
    在纪念今年“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我们英勇的抗美援朝人民志愿军的代表，人民解放军的战斗英雄，劳动模范，农业生产模范，政治、经济、文化工作中的模范工作者，和少数民族的代表，参加纪念典礼，受到人民的尊敬和热烈欢迎。世界工联和苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古、德意志、越南、印度、瑞典、丹麦、缅甸、锡兰、澳大利亚、英国、伊朗等国家的工会组织，接受了中华全国总工会的邀请，派遣了代表团来我国参加纪念典礼。应我国中央人民政府的邀请、来到我国的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团、缅甸文化代表团和印度文化代表团，也参加这个纪念典礼。应我国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的邀请来到我国的法国文化界著名人士法奇夫妇、罗阿夫妇和意大利文化界著名人士班菲先生、费斯康提先生、德·桑蒂先生、潘尼齐先生也参加这个纪念典礼。出席莫斯科国际经济会议的越南、印度、缅甸、印尼、澳大利亚、巴西、英国、阿根廷、加拿大、锡兰、智利、法国、墨西哥、委内瑞拉等国代表也前来我国参观，参加这个纪念典礼。代表着英勇的朝鲜人民的朝鲜人民访华代表团，在访问我全国各地之后，聚集在北京，参加纪念典礼。应我国政府邀请，前来我国表演、受到我国人民热烈欢迎的匈牙利国家人民文工团也参加这个纪念典礼。这些来自社会制度不同的各国代表们，在这个伟大节日里聚集在我国首都，象征了各国工人阶级和一切国家爱好和平人民之间的和平合作的愿望。
    我国人民以无限的喜悦和胜利的信心来纪念今年的“五一”国际劳动节，在今天这个日子，我们不但应该庆祝我们已有的伟大胜利，而且应该进一步动员我们的一切力量，投入抗美援朝和爱国增产节约运动中去，在保卫和建设我们祖国的神圣事业中，在反对帝国主义侵略和争取世界持久和平的事业中，作出更多更大的贡献。
