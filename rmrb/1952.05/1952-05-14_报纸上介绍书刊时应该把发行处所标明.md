    Newspapers Should Indicate Where Books are Published When Introducing Them
    Newspapers and magazines often introduce newly published books, which is very helpful to readers. Some book introductions not only comment on the content of the books, but also tell readers about the author, the place of publication and distribution, and the price of the book. This is very convenient for readers who want to buy such books. However, some book introductions do not pay attention to this. Sometimes, we want to buy books recommended in newspapers or magazines, but we don't know where to buy them, nor do we know how much a copy costs, so we have to write to the newspaper or bookstore to inquire, which takes a lot of time. Therefore, I suggest that newspapers and magazines should also write down the price and place of publication when introducing new books.

    报纸上介绍书刊时应该把发行处所标明
    报纸和杂志时常介绍新出版的书籍，这对读者的帮助很大。有一些书刊介绍，不只评述了书刊的内容，而且把它的作者、出版发行处所和书价也告诉读者。这对想购买这种书的读者很方便。但有一些书刊介绍没有注意这一点。有时，我们想买报纸或杂志上推荐的书，但不知道要到那里才能买到，也不知道买一本要多少钱，还得写信到报社或书店去打听，花费许多时间。因此，我建议报纸和杂志介绍新书时，把书籍定价和发行的处所也写上。
