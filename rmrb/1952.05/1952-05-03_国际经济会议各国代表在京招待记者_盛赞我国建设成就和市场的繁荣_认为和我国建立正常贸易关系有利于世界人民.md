Some of the delegates have visited Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou separately, and have had full contact with people from economic and cultural circles. The delegates have gained an understanding of China's wealth, China's long-standing culture and art, and especially recognized China's importance in international economic issues now and in the future. Xiang Bolang said: The success of the Moscow International Economic Conference has proven that countries with different social systems can and should restore and develop trade, which is a good way to maintain and strengthen peace. The delegates from various countries congratulated China on its existing achievements and greater achievements in the future, and that establishing normal economic relations between China and other countries is beneficial to the people of the whole world.

Afterwards, the delegates from various countries answered questions raised by reporters.

British representative Horsley praised the huge increase in factory production under the new management system he saw during his visit to Shanghai, as well as the improvement of workers' working conditions and the high enthusiasm for work; he also expressed his appreciation for the abundance of goods on the market and the brisk sales. Horsley said: Shanghai will become one of the largest commercial ports in the world in the near future, and the delegates from various countries will do their best to break down all obstacles to international trade after returning to their countries.

British representative McClelland said: He was deeply surprised to see that New China has stood up economically so quickly when visiting Tianjin. He described the increase in workers' rationalization proposals, the increase in welfare, and the prosperity of the market in the factories he saw. He said: In Tianjin, he has seen that the blockade has not suffocated Tianjin's activities, and he hopes that Tianjin can restore its important international status in the near future.

Argentine representative Cuneo talked about his impression after visiting the new rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing after the land reform, saying: The increase in agricultural production has proven that the measures taken by the current People's Government are extremely correct. The enthusiasm of the peasants fully demonstrates their satisfaction with the land reform. The improvement of the peasants' living standards has laid the foundation for the market and for the needs of industry.

French representative Lebrun enthusiastically talked about his feelings about participating in the "May Day" parade, saying: The marching masses showed the unity of the whole of China, which was deeply moving. Through the parade, people truly understand New China and appreciate China's efforts to promote the normalization of international relations and defend peace.

Burmese representative Wu La said: Developing trade between China and other countries on the basis of equality and cooperation is beneficial to improving the living standards of the people of all countries. Indian representative De Zhula said: Coming to China, he has fully seen the Chinese people's hope for peace and friendship with the people of the world, and we will report the great achievements of New China's construction after we go back.

Canadian representative Miller, Brazilian representative Oliveri, and British representative Boulton all expressed their opinions on the prospects for promoting trade between China and other countries.

Xiang Bolang finally talked about the issue of breaking down artificial barriers that hinder the normal development of international trade, saying: The delegates from various countries have seen during their visit to China that these barriers are more harmful to the economic situation of the countries that create the barriers. We will do our best to break down these barriers. Through the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, some issues will be resolved. People know that developing normal trade relations is beneficial to everyone. Through this relationship, people will understand and love each other more, which will be of great help to world peace.
