    Zhao Wenxia, a young female worker at the Beijing Garment Factory, now feels she is the happiest person. She feels filled with love for the motherland, and the motherland also loves her. This feeling began with the "Three-Anti" Movement.

    During the most intense period of the anti-corruption struggle in the Beijing Garment Factory this February, Zhao Wenxia's production achievements were soaring. Within a month, she increased her labor productivity to four times what it had been, and set a factory record for making collars. This included changes in her thoughts and feelings: deep down, she now links herself with the new China and the Communist Party.

    Like many workers, Zhao Wenxia began a happy life after liberation, but she never recognized her happiness. This was because she was influenced by bourgeois ideology. This influence was like a rope that bound her, preventing her from moving forward.

    Before the "Three-Anti" Movement, Zhao Wenxia's production results were often the lowest in her group. At that time, she often participated in discussions about patriotic production increases and resisting America and aiding Korea, but she didn't take these things to heart. She seemed to be working hard all day long and tried to learn from others' techniques, but she only wanted to earn more money to buy fancy shoes or a nice dress. If she couldn't learn, she wouldn't bother. When everyone else was competing, or when she felt happy, she would work hard for a couple of days, but quickly became tired. She worked hard to study culture, but only so she could find a different job in the future. She didn't understand the meaning of labor, and sometimes even envied the wealth-making businesses of the bourgeoisie, thinking they were better off than her.

    During the loyalty and honesty movement last winter, Zhao Wenxia initially recognized and approached the Communist Party. When confessing her history, she voluntarily went to the Party branch secretary and recounted in detail the humiliation and torture she had suffered in the old society while working with her mother as a servant. The more she spoke, the more saddened she became, eventually bursting into tears. At this time, she received deep sympathy and encouragement from the branch secretary, recognizing the glory and bright future of her class. For the first time in her life, she felt human warmth, feeling that the great Communist Party and the working class were supporting her. She remembered the branch secretary's words to her: "You are a member of the working class, you must hate the old society, love the new China, and serve the motherland and the cause of communism well!"

    Immediately afterward, the factory launched the "Three-Anti" Movement. Zhao Wenxia participated in the "tiger-beating" struggle. In the struggle, she clearly saw two kinds of thoughts and behaviors: the great and glorious working class, who produce wealth for the country and cherish national property; and the illegal bourgeois elements, who are selfish and self-serving, harming the public to benefit themselves, and stealing national property. She saw that the things everyone painstakingly saved, such as a thread end or an inch of cloth, ended up in the hands of corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants, and her heart was filled with anger and hatred. While participating in the anti-corruption struggle, she constantly examined her own thoughts. While walking or sleeping, she constantly questioned herself: "In the old society, you were like a sheep lost in the deep mountains, who might be eaten by tigers and wolves at any time! Now the Communist Party has come, and there is a new China. You don't have to worry about food, clothing, or a job, and you can go to school. When you were first liberated, you couldn't even write the word 'factory,' but now you are a first-year junior high school student. Why don't you understand this happiness? Why don't you dedicate yourself entirely to the country and work hard, instead of being so-so?"

    After repeated reflection, she began to connect herself with the Communist Party and the new China. Her attitude towards labor also changed.

    In the past, Zhao Wenxia didn't put her heart into her work, and once she left the factory, she didn't think about production anymore; now, she regards her labor as a glorious contribution to the country and the cause of communism. She demands that she work better and is determined to learn technology. In the past, she could never learn the "no-wheel-assist" short-stitch method of working. This time, she was determined to learn it. On the way home from work, she would recall the shortcomings in her operation and ways to correct them, write them down, and experiment with corrections the next day at work. Li Xiuzhen in her group was the fastest worker, so she made a deal with Xiuzhen: she would teach Xiuzhen to read, and Xiuzhen would teach her technology. As a result of dedicating her whole heart to diligent study and hard work, her production performance improved by leaps and bounds. She made summer clothing collars, increasing from sixty a day to one hundred and twenty, then one hundred and eighty. Finally, she improved Li Xiuzhen's method of sewing collars using half a cardboard collar template to using a complete collar template, greatly reducing the stitching time, and making two hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty a day, creating the highest record in the factory.

    Zhao Wenxia received a bonus that was higher than her original salary. Some people said, "Buy a new bicycle!" But Zhao Wenxia was no longer interested in these things; she was interested in the creative labor of increasing wealth for the country. She hoped that the whole group could learn the "no-wheel-assist" working method. Some people were afraid that learning would reduce production and affect their income, so she was willing to pay for this loss. In the past, Zhao Wenxia rarely cared about the affairs of the group and didn't talk to people much. Now, when she saw someone who wasn't working hard or who had something on their mind, she would try to talk to them and help them solve it.

    In the past, Zhao Wenxia only had her two textbooks; now she has bought many books describing the deeds of heroes and models, and subscribed to the People's Daily and the Workers' Daily. Even during the little free time she had while combing her hair or washing her face, she would ask her father to read the newspaper to her. Whenever she encountered difficulties at work, she would use the spirit of Zhao Yiman and Liu Hulan to educate herself. She wrote in her diary: "Why do you bow your head to difficulties? Liu Hulan didn't bow her head under the enemy's knife!"

    Zhao Wenxia constantly receives help and encouragement from the Party. The branch secretary not only talked to her about how to work and study, but also reminded her to pay attention to her health. She said, "I will use the Party's words in my work, and not waste a single one."

    赵文霞认识了自己的幸福
    力文  林沫
    北京被服厂青年女工赵文霞现在觉得自己是最幸福的人。她感到自己充满对祖国的热爱，祖国也在热爱着她。这种心情，是从“三反”运动开始的。
    今年二月北京被服厂反贪污斗争最紧张的时期，正是赵文霞的生产成绩飞速上涨的时候。她在一个月内使劳动生产率提高到过去的四倍，做领子创造了全厂最高纪录。这中间包含着她的思想感情的变化：在她的内心深处，现在她把她个人和新中国、共产党联结在一起了。
    赵文霞也和许多工人一样，在解放以后就开始了幸福的生活，但她却一直不认识幸福。这是因为她受了资产阶级思想的影响。这影响像绳子一样缠着她，使她不能前进。
    “三反”运动以前，赵文霞的生产成绩在小组里常常是最低的。那时，她也常常参加爱国增产、抗美援朝的讨论，但她却不把这些事放在心里。看起来，她也是整天闷着头在干活，也曾试着学别人的技术，但她只是想多得些钱，买双讲究的鞋子，添件花衣服之类。学不会，也就不学了。当大家竞赛起来，或自己高兴起来了，就拚命干上两天，但很快就疲踏下来。她曾下苦心学习文化，但只是为的将来能找点别的事作。她不了解劳动的意义，有时甚至羡慕资产阶级的发财买卖，觉得还是人家比咱强。
    在去年冬季的忠诚老实运动中，赵文霞初步认识和靠近了共产党。她在交代历史时，曾自动的去找党支部书记，详细诉说了自己在旧社会跟着作佣工的母亲所受的屈辱和折磨。越讲越伤心，竟至痛哭起来。这时，她从支部书记得到了深深的同情和鼓励，认识了自己阶级的光荣和光明远大的前途。她生平第一次感到人间的温暖，感到有伟大的共产党和工人阶级在支持自己。她牢记着支部书记对她说的话：“你是工人阶级，要恨旧社会，爱新中国，好好为祖国、为共产主义事业服务！”
    紧接着，工厂里开展了“三反”运动。赵文霞参加了“打虎”斗争。她在斗争中清楚地看到了两种思想和行为：伟大光荣的工人阶级，他们为国家生产财富，爱护国家财产；不法的资产阶级分子，则是损人利己，损公利私，盗窃国家财产。她看到大家费尽心思地一段线头、一寸布条节约下来的东西，却落到贪污分子和奸商的手里，心里激荡着愤怒和仇恨。她一面参加反贪污斗争，一面不断地检查自己的思想。她在走路或睡觉的时候，也不断地责问自己：“在旧社会，你好比丢在深山里的羊，说不定什么时候就会被虎狼吃掉！现在共产党来了，有了新中国，你不愁吃穿，不愁职业，又能上学。刚解放时自己连‘工厂’两个字都不会写，现在是初中一年级的学生了。你为什么不懂得这些幸福呢？为什么还不把自己全部献给国家，好好干活，而要马马虎虎呢？”
    经过反复思索，她开始把自己和共产党、新中国联结在一起了。她对劳动的态度也改变了。
    过去，赵文霞工作时不用心，一出工厂就再不想生产的事了；现在，她把自己的劳动作为对国家、对共产主义事业的光荣贡献。她要求自己工作得更好，决心学习技术。她过去学习“不扶轮”少停针的工作方法，总学不好。这次她下决心来学习。在下工回家的路上，也在回想操作中的缺点和改正办法，写下来，在第二天工作时进行改正的实验。本组的李秀珍作活最快，她就和秀珍订下条件，她教秀珍学文化，秀珍教她学技术。倾全心勤学苦练的结果，她的生产成绩大踏步地前进了。她做夏服领子，从每天六十个提高到一百二十个，一百八十个。最后，她又把李秀珍使用半个硬纸领样子缝领子的方法，改进到使用一个完整的领样子缝，大大减少了停针时间，一天可以做二百二十个到二百四十个，创造了全厂的最高纪录。
    赵文霞得到了比原工资还要多的超额奖金。有的人说：“你买一辆新自行车吧！”但赵文霞感兴趣的已不是这些事了，她感兴趣的是为国家增加财富的创造性的劳动。她希望全组都能学会“不扶轮”的工作方法。有的人怕学习时减低产量，影响自己的收入，她就愿意拿钱补偿这种损失。赵文霞过去很少关心组里的事情，也不大和人谈心，现在她看到有谁作活不起劲，心里有事情，她就要想法和她谈谈，帮她解决。
    赵文霞过去学习，总是那两本学习课本；现在她买了不少描写英雄、模范事迹的书，订了人民日报、工人日报。那怕是每天梳头、洗脸时的一点空闲，她也要请父亲给她读报。每当工作中遇到困难，她就拿赵一曼、刘胡兰的精神来教育自己。她在日记里写着：“你为什么向困难低头呢？刘胡兰在敌人的刀下就没有低头呀！”
    赵文霞不断得到党的帮助和鼓励。支部书记不单和她谈如何工作和学习，还提醒她要注意自己的身体。她说：“我要把党的话都用在工作上，一句也不让它浪费掉。”
