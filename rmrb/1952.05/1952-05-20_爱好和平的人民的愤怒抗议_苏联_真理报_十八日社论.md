    The Angry Protest of Peace-Loving People
    -- "Pravda" Editorial on the 18th of May

    All people with a sense of justice are filled with righteous indignation when they see the heinous crimes of the American beast army in Korea. The American beast army has adopted the brutal methods of Hitler and engaged in the behavior of bloodthirsty bandits.

    It has been almost two years since the American aggressors launched a predatory war against the peace-loving Korean people and widely used the heinous weapons of mass human slaughter. The interventionists originally wanted to use torture, mass executions, and the slaughter of the old, weak, women, and children to intimidate the Korean people. However, no atrocity by the aggressors has been able to, and will never be able to, destroy the heroic Korean people's will to fight for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The Korean people, fighting in coordination with the Chinese People's Volunteers who have risen to their aid, are bravely repelling the frenzied offensives of the beastly aggressors.

    Because of repeated failures in the war of aggression against the Korean people, the American imperialists have used the most abominable and hateful weapons of mass human slaughter—bacteriological and chemical weapons. The International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team has published many atrocities committed by the American interventionist army and its lackey, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) gang. Based on irrefutable materials that have been thoroughly examined, the investigation team concluded that the American forces in Korea are deliberately spreading bacteria-carrying insects, using napalm bombs and chemical bombs and chemical substances, massacring civilians in large numbers, bombing undefended cities and villages far from the front lines, and killing prisoners of war.

    Mrs. Molhant, a Belgian lawyer and member of the investigation team, said at a press conference in Brussels: "We know for sure that American pilots have shot at elementary school students taking a break from class and have bombed churches where services were being held. The Americans have tortured their victims with insane cruelty—branding them with red-hot irons, driving nails into their brains, tearing out their hair... Many families were buried alive... The use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China by the Americans confirms the fact that they are using modern science to carry out the most serious crimes against humanity."

    Numerous irrefutable facts have proven that the American ruling clique has been preparing for bacteriological warfare for a long time. Everyone knows that in 1947, American President Truman even withdrew the Geneva Protocol banning the use of bacteriological weapons, which had already been submitted to the Senate for approval. At the end of 1950, the American troops retreating from North Korea had already spread smallpox germs. According to the Associated Press, in the spring of 1951, a special American "plague ship" docked on the coast of Geoje Island and used captured Korean People's Army soldiers for experiments. The imperialist warmongers are trying to justify the crime of using bacteriological weapons. General Creasy, Chief of Research and Development of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, shamelessly said: Bacteria, poison gas, and chemical weapons are the cheapest weapons; they eliminate the enemy's manpower but do not damage property.

    The bloody events on Geoje Island have even more clearly exposed the bestiality of the American savages. A dispatch from Korea published in today's newspaper cites new documents exposing the heinous crimes of the American military. Sergeant Chai Chengyu of the Korean People's Army recently escaped from the island of death, Geoje Island, and wrote an article in the "Korean People's Army" newspaper saying:

    "The terrible persecution I suffered on Geoje Island, and the terrible persecution that our brothers in the hands of the American fascists are still suffering there, is difficult to describe in words. To be captured by the American army is to enter hell... I was detained in the 76th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, which was a row of dark and dirty barracks, with nothing on the bunks and very humid air; this prisoner-of-war camp had eighteen torture chambers and six so-called steam rooms, where American executioners put the 'troublemakers' among the prisoners of war, subjecting them to unbearable torture at extremely high temperatures, often resulting in death; there were four gallows set up to punish the captured personnel..."

    A group of prisoners of war who were originally detained on Geoje Island and rescued by guerrillas fighting in South Korea broadcast an appeal to the Korean and Chinese people on a guerrilla radio station. The appeal said: "Dear Korean and Chinese brothers and sisters! The American devils on Geoje Island are using unprecedentedly cruel methods against our captured personnel. Truman, the American executioners and murderers, have turned the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island into a torture camp for experimenting with chemical, bacteriological, and atomic weapons on captured personnel, a death camp. In February and May, American cannibals used machine guns, grenades, and tear gas to carry out bloody suppression of the prisoners of war. In April and early May, they threatened us with death and forced us to sign blood oaths that amounted to betraying our motherland and people. We demanded that the camp commander accept the conditions we proposed for the release of American General Dodd, whom we had captured. General Clark, commander of the 'United Nations Forces,' personally promised us that he would accept these conditions and promised to immediately end the atrocities and insults against the prisoners of war. But on May 12, Clark cunningly tore up his promise and, on the pretext that the prisoners of war had detained General Dodd, began brutal punishment of the prisoners of war. The aggressors massacred, hanged, and poisoned hundreds of our brothers, flagrantly violating international law. But the murderers and executioners will never be able to destroy the will of the Korean and Chinese patriots. No threat or abuse by the aggressors can make the prisoners of war betray their motherland."

    The heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors on Geoje Island are now known to the whole world. American General Colson has admitted to the atrocities against prisoners of war and the massacre of prisoners of war.

    The atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea under the cover of the United Nations flag have aroused deep anger among peace-loving people. The people express their firm protest against the bloody atrocities of the American army using Hitler's fascist methods.

    China's "People's Daily" said: "Our people of China and Korea resolutely oppose the American aggressors' evil conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel; our firm will will not be shaken in the slightest by any destruction or threat to the Korean armistice negotiations by the American aggressors."

    Poland's "People's Tribune" expresses the will of the free Polish people: "The American imperialists will never be able to cover up the truth about their crimes. The recent Geoje Island incident is another indictment against the gold-dollar murderers."

    Pakistan's "Today" newspaper said: "The United States does not value people, nor does it value culture or civilization. It has only one goal, which is to establish its rule over all mankind by any means..."

    The All-India Peace Council has issued an appeal to all peace-loving people in India, calling on them to protest the crimes of American imperialism.

    The peace-loving people of all countries are expressing their angry protests against the despicable crimes of the American beast army, are becoming more vigilant about the conspiracies of the imperialist new war instigators, and are intensifying the struggle for peace throughout the world.

    爱好和平的人民的愤怒抗议
    ——苏联“真理报”十八日社论
    一切有正义感的人们看到美国兽军在朝鲜的万恶罪行，莫不义愤填膺。美国兽军已经采用了希特勒的残暴手段，干起嗜杀成性的强盗的行为来了。
    美国侵略者对爱好和平的朝鲜人民发动掠夺战争、广泛使用大规模屠杀人类的罪恶武器，到现在已经快两年了。干涉军本来想用酷刑、集体枪杀、屠杀老弱妇孺等手段吓倒朝鲜人民。但是，侵略者的任何暴行都没有能够，而且永远不能摧毁英勇的朝鲜人民为祖国的自由与独立而斗争的意志。朝鲜人民与奋起援助他们的中国人民志愿军协同作战，正在英勇地击退野兽般的侵略军的疯狂进攻。
    美帝国主义者由于在侵略朝鲜人民的战争中迭遭失败，就使用了最可恶、最可恨的大规模屠杀人类的武器——细菌武器和化学武器。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团已经公布了美国干涉军及其走狗李承晚匪帮的许多暴行。调查团根据经过彻底审查的无可置辩的材料，得出一个结论：朝鲜美军正在故意撒布带菌昆虫，使用凝固汽油弹及化学弹与化学品，大批屠杀平民，轰炸远离前线的不设防的城市和乡村，并杀害战俘。
    调查团团员、比利时律师莫伦斯夫人在布鲁塞尔的一次记者招待会上说：“我们确知：美国飞行员曾经向下课休息的小学生开枪，并曾经轰炸正在举行礼拜的教堂。美国人丧心病狂地对他们的受害者施用酷刑——用烧红了的熨斗烙他们、往他们脑子里面钉钉子、扯掉他们的头发……有许多家庭是全家被活埋的……美国人在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的事证实了这样一个事实，就是：他们正在利用现代科学去进行最严重的为害人类的罪行。”
    许许多多驳不倒的事实已经证明：美国统治集团长时期以来就在准备细菌战。大家知道，一九四七年美国总统杜鲁门甚至将已经提到参议院等候批准的禁止使用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书撤了回去。在一九五○年底，从北朝鲜败退的美国军队就已经撒布了天花病菌。据美联社报道，一九五一年春季有美国的一艘特别的“鼠疫船”在巨济岛岸停泊，利用被俘的朝鲜人民军战士作实验。帝国主义战争贩子们正在力图为使用细菌武器的罪行辩解。美国陆军化学兵团研究与发展处处长克利西将军曾经恬不知耻地说：细菌、毒气和化学武器是最便宜的武器，它们消灭敌方的人力，却不伤害财产。
    巨济岛上的血腥事件已经更加清楚地暴露了美国生番们的兽性。今天本报所刊载的一条从朝鲜发来的电讯，引用了揭露美国军方的万恶罪行的新文件。朝鲜人民军上士柴诚玉（译音）最近从死亡之岛巨济岛逃出，在“朝鲜人民军”报上写文章说：
    “我在巨济岛上所受过的恐怖迫害，和在美国法西斯分子手中的我们的弟兄们仍然在那里受着的恐怖迫害，是难以用语言形容的。被美军俘获，就是进了地狱。……我曾被拘留在巨济岛上的第七十六号战俘营，这个战俘营就是一排阴暗而肮脏的营房，里面的铺上没有铺着任何东西，空气十分潮湿；这个战俘营中有十八间酷刑室，六间所谓蒸气室，美国刽子手们把战俘中间的‘谋乱者’放在这种房间里，使他们在极高的温度下受难以忍受的折磨，其结果往往是死亡；有四个绞架，是为惩罚被俘人员而设的……”
    被在南朝鲜作战的游击队救出来的一批原来被拘禁在巨济岛上的战俘们，在游击队的一个电台上向朝鲜人民和中国人民广播了一篇呼吁书。呼吁书说：“朝鲜和中国的亲爱的兄弟姐妹们！巨济岛上的美国恶魔正在对我方被俘人员使用前所未闻的残暴手段。杜鲁门、美国的刽子手和杀人犯们，已经把巨济岛上的战俘营变成了用被俘人员来试验化学武器、细菌武器和原子武器的酷刑营，变成了死亡营。在二月和五月里，美国吃人生番曾用机关枪、手榴弹和催泪性毒气对战俘们实行血腥的镇压。在四月份与五月初，他们以死亡相威胁，强迫我们签署等于背叛我们祖国与人民的血书。我们要求俘虏营长官接受我们为释放被我们俘掳的美国杜德将军而提出的条件。‘联合国军’司令克拉克将军亲自答应我们接受这些条件，并答应立即终止对战俘的暴行与侮辱。但是在五月十二日，克拉克狡诈地撕毁了他的诺言，藉口战俘扣留了杜德将军而对战俘开始残暴的惩罚。侵略者们屠杀、绞死及毒死成百的我们的弟兄，横暴地违反了国际法。但是杀人犯和刽子手们决摧毁不了朝鲜与中国爱国者的意志。侵略者的任何威胁或虐待都不能使战俘们背叛他们的祖国。”
    美国侵略者在巨济岛犯下的滔天罪行，现在已为全世界所周知。美国的将军柯尔生已经承认了对战俘的暴行与屠杀战俘的事实。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜借联合国旗帜的掩护而犯下的暴行，已经激起了爱好和平人民的深刻愤怒。人民对于美国军队使用希特勒法西斯手段的血腥暴行，表示坚决的抗议。
    中国的“人民日报”说：“我们中朝两国人民是坚决反对美国侵略者强迫扣留我方被俘人员的罪恶阴谋的；我们的坚强意志决不因美国侵略者对朝鲜停战谈判的任何破坏和威胁而有丝毫动摇。”
    波兰“人民论坛报”表示自由波兰人民的意志说：“美帝国主义者决计掩盖不了他们罪行的真相。最近的巨济岛事件就是又一次对金元杀人犯的控告。”
    巴基斯坦的“今天报”说：“美国既不重视人民，也不重视文化或文明。它只有一个目标，就是不惜以任何手段建立它对全人类的统治……”
    全印和平理事会已向印度全体爱好和平的人民发出呼吁书，号召他们对美帝国主义的罪行表示抗议。
    各国爱好和平的人民都在表示他们对于美国兽军的卑劣罪行的愤怒抗议，都在更加警惕帝国主义新战争挑拨者的阴谋，并且都在加紧全世界争取和平的斗争。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯）
