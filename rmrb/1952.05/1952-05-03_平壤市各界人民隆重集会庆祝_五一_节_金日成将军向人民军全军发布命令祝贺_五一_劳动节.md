    Today, we are fighting together with the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people - the Chinese People's Volunteers. The great feats and achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in our Fatherland Liberation War will be forever recorded in our country's history.
    Our struggle is not isolated. The power of the true internationalist friendly unity of the world's peaceful and democratic camp is being consolidated and expanded day by day; but the enemy's situation is different. As time goes by, the enemy's military and political weaknesses and internal contradictions are gradually deepening. The forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are much stronger than the forces of warmongers.
    The order also said: The Korean people believe that their armed forces—the Korean People's Army, fighting side by side with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, will certainly be able to defend the freedom and honor of the Fatherland and smash the aggression of American imperialism. There is no doubt that our army will realize the expectations of our people.
