Whenever discussing literary and artistic issues with Chinese friends, whether they are unique to China or are issues that would attract the attention of any literary worker, people often turn the topic to some of the arguments in Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This is correct, because after studying this speech, one can hardly think of any unclear questions. Therefore, the tenth anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is not only very important for Chinese literary workers, but also a very significant day for all of us.

I feel that "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is especially important for German literary workers. This is true not only for us in the German Democratic Republic, but also for writers and artists in West Germany, separated by artificial demarcation lines. Why? Mao Zedong's speech was made during the resistance against Japanese imperialism. Here, it involved the people of all strata in China who resisted foreign aggression and their representatives. The speech at the forum posed this question to all literary workers—whose works would be read, seen, and heard by people of all strata united in the camp of national resistance: For whom do you write? The speech also mentioned soldiers, workers, and peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. In the broad scope touched upon by this same question, one can see its relationship to the literary and artistic issues of our own country.

Mao Zedong began by saying, "In our discussion, we should start from reality, not from definitions." Precisely because of this, anyone who applies Mao Zedong's teachings to their own specific situation will also find answers to many of the problems they encounter daily. I cite the relationship between popularization and improvement as an example. Here (referring to Germany - translator), we also often lose sight of one for the other, rather than closely linking a work of art between content and form. But he also explained to literary and art workers that correct content is always the first priority.

The same relationship exists when answering the questions of "classical literature" and "popular literature." He not only told Chinese literary workers, but also pointed out to all literary workers the significance of national classical literature, the significance of critically studying it, and the significance of critically studying foreign classical literature. At the same time, he also pointed out to us the significance of "crude... mass-based literature," which is fresh stuff produced from the labor process.

But the speech at the Yan'an Forum not only includes the famous and brilliant debates and educational issues. It also points out the entire basis for the importance of literature and art. When concentrated and expressed in a typical way, literature and art can sometimes play a greater role than reality itself. Because in reality, the essential things are always mixed with many trivial matters.

I only quote a few points from the speech, which are also points that every German writer can immediately understand. Every Chinese friend will be able to explain the full practical significance of the speech much better than I can. I think our discussion and study of this speech is still not enough.

The issues clarified by Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and our Soviet mentors on literary and artistic issues are explained in this speech in accordance with situations that are somewhat similar to ours (referring to Germany - translator) today. This is the situation of a country where various different strata and elements are converging towards a national scope.

In the German Democratic Republic, thanks to various measures by our government, an increasingly wider range of people are able to enjoy art and culture. What a great opportunity and what a great responsibility this is for literary workers! The more strongly the literary worker feels this, the more he will love his art.

Mao Zedong's speech helped me when I read it several years ago. It helped me see some of my mistakes. It will also help me to avoid making mistakes in the future. In front of each of us lies the question that Mao Zedong raised at the Yan'an Forum: For whom do you want to write? In this powerful speech, there are not many "isms" (such as formalism, surrealism, etc.), and it is easy to get bogged down in discussing these. The speech does not have these, nor could it, because it starts from specific situations.

Mao Zedong's speech has great significance for our peace movement. Whoever studies and understands it, and applies his understanding to his work and environment, is a literary worker who is working for freedom and peace. (Attached picture)

### 纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年

    纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年
    德国女作家  “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人  安娜·西格斯
    每当和中国朋友们讨论到文艺方面的问题时，无论是中国所特有的问题也罢，或者是足以激发任何一个文艺工作者注意的问题也罢，人们在大多场合总要把话题转到毛泽东的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中的一些论点上去。这是对的，因为在研究了这一讲话以后，人们简直想不出还有什么不清楚的问题。因此，“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年纪念日不仅对中国的文艺工作者非常重要，而且也是对我们大家一个极有意义的日子。
    我觉得，“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”对德国文艺工作者更是特别重要。这不仅首先对于在德意志民主共和国的我们是如此，而且对于那被人为的分界线所隔开的西德的作家和美术家来说也是如此。为什么？毛泽东的讲话是在抵抗日本帝国主义的时候作的。在这里，它涉及了抵抗外国侵略的中国各阶层人民和他们的代表者。座谈会讲话向一切文艺工作者——他们的作品将被团结在民族抵抗的阵营中的各阶层人民所读到、看到和听到——提出了这样一个问题：你为什么人而写？讲话中也提到了士兵、工人和农民，小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。人们在这同一个问题所接触到的广泛范围中，可以看到它与我们自己国家的文艺问题的关系。
    毛泽东一开始就说“我们讨论问题，应从实际出发，不是从定义出发。”正因为如此，任何人只要把毛泽东的学说运用到自己的具体情况上时，他也将对他日常所遇到的许多问题找到答案。我举出普及和提高之间的关系问题作为一个例子来说。在这里
    （指德国——译者），我们也常常顾此失彼而不是把一个艺术作品在内容和形式之间密切地联系起来。可是他又向文艺工作者们说明，正确的内容总是占第一位的事情。
    在回答“古典文学”和“大众文学”的问题时，也有同样的关系。他不仅告诉中国的文艺工作者，而且也向一切文艺工作者指出了民族的古典文学的意义在那里，对它进行批判性的研究以及对外国的古典文学进行批判性的研究，其意义又在那里。同时他也向我们指出了“粗糙的……群众性的文艺”的意义，这是从劳动过程中产生的新鲜的东西。
    但是文艺座谈会讲话还不仅包括著名的光辉的论辩和教育问题而已。它也指出了文艺的重要性的全部根据。当集中和表现了典型的东西的时候，文艺有时可以比现实本身起更大的作用。因为在现实中，本质的东西总是和许多琐碎的事情夹杂在一起的。
    我只引述讲话中的少数几点，这些也是每一个德国作家在其中立刻就能理会到的几点。要说明讲话的全部现实意义，这一点每一个中国朋友都会比我做得好得多。我以为我们对这一讲话的讨论和研究还是很不够的。
    马克思和恩格斯、列宁和斯大林以及我们的苏联导师们在文艺问题上所阐明的问题，在这个讲话中是按照和我们（指德国——译者）今天有部分类似性的情况被说明了。这就是各个不同的阶层和分子正在向着一个全民族的范围汇集拢来的国家的情况。
    在德意志民主共和国，由于我们政府的各种措施，愈来愈广泛阶层的人民能够获得艺术和文化的享受了。这对于文艺工作者是一个怎样良好的机会，也是怎样重大的责任啊！文艺工作者感到这点愈是强烈，他也将愈加爱他的艺术。
    毛泽东的讲话在我数年前读到它的时候曾经帮助了我。它帮助我看到我的若干错误。它今后也将帮助我去避免犯错误。我们每一个人面前都放着这样的问题有如毛泽东在延安文艺座谈会上所提出的：你愿为谁而写？在这有力的讲话中并没有许多“主义”（例如关于形式主义，超现实主义等），要讨论起这些来是很容易走到牛角尖去的。讲话中没有这些，也不可能有，因为它是从具体情况出发的。
    毛泽东的讲话对我们的和平运动具有伟大的意义。谁研究和理解了它，并把他的体会应用到他的工作和周围环境中去的话，他也就是为自由与和平而努力的文艺工作者了。（附图片）
