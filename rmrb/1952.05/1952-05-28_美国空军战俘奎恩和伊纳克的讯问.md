    Interrogation of U.S. Air Force Prisoners of War Quinn and Enok
    By Our Correspondent    Lin Hong
    As a member of the "Joint Korean-Chinese Expert Journalist Interrogation Team," I personally participated in the interrogation of U.S. Air Force prisoners of war Enok and Quinn. Because these two prisoners confessed without reservation the detailed process of dropping germ bombs in Korea, we smoothly completed our work in about two weeks.
    Before the interrogation, the person in charge of the Korean-Chinese People's Army prisoner of war camp, as well as the comrade translator who lived with Enok and Quinn day and night, introduced to us in detail the circumstances of their confession of dropping germ bombs.
    When Enok and Quinn arrived at the prisoner of war camp, their behavior was very different from that of other ordinary American prisoners of war. Especially when asked if they had dropped germ bombs, they appeared very panicked and uneasy. The management authorities of the prisoner of war camp, in accordance with the principles of lenient treatment and respect for the personality of prisoners, did not use any coercive methods to continue questioning them, but repeatedly and patiently explained to them our policy towards prisoners of war, pointing out to them: if they had dropped germ bombs in Korea and China in the past under the deception of American war merchants, it was originally a serious criminal act that violated international law and humanitarian principles; but as long as they could sincerely repent and tell the whole truth, they would certainly be treated with leniency. At the same time, they were given the same treatment as other prisoners of war in terms of life, and they were given sufficient food and supplies. This humane treatment deeply moved them, and they finally dispelled their concerns and confessed the process of dropping germ bombs in Korea.
    The comrade translator told us that after Enok and Quinn confessed to dropping germ bombs, they seemed to have unloaded a heavy burden, and their spirits immediately became relaxed and happy. When the first film was taken for Enok, he smiled and said to the comrade translator: "It is a pity that the film was not recorded at the same time today. I hope to do this in the future." All the comrades of our joint interrogation team held a meeting to study these circumstances. Everyone believed that since these two prisoners of war had already completely voluntarily admitted the main facts before and after dropping germ bombs and no longer had any major ideological concerns, it was decided to immediately talk to them in groups and then conduct a collective interrogation.
    When we talked to these two prisoners of war, we adopted a very casual way of talking. Each time, Enok or Quinn and we sat together, drinking water and smoking while talking without restraint. In addition to asking them about their germ warfare training and the process of dropping germ bombs, we also asked about their family life and their feelings after being captured. We first talked to Quinn on one evening. We and several experts from Korea and China walked up a hillside and stopped in front of a small wooden house. This wooden house was more than ten feet long and more than ten feet wide. Bright lights were shining inside. The Korean comrade who was with us told me that it was not easy to live in such a house under the current war situation. We saw a rectangular wooden table on one side of the room, with several books, a pack of Chinese cigarettes, a bowl of leftover fish, and some scattered items on it. On the kang mat on the other side of the room, there were two sleeping berths of almost the same size, with quilts and blankets. The sleeping berth on the inside was Quinn's, and next to it was his original U.S. Air Force uniform. The other sleeping berth was that of translator Comrade Zhou Dao. That night, Quinn was wearing a yellow U.S. Air Force sweater and leather boots. He had a small, slightly brown beard, his face was ruddy, and he looked very healthy. When translator Comrade Zhou Dao explained our intentions to him, he immediately happily let us into the house and hurriedly rolled up the quilts and other items with Comrade Zhou Dao. Because there were not enough seats, most of us sat around on the kang mat.
    At the beginning of the conversation, we first asked him about his feelings after being captured. He replied:
    "Since I was captured, I have been treated very well, which surprised me very much. I not only get daily necessities, but also luxuries such as cigarettes and candy. After I was captured, I felt that I might be punished; however, this concern was quickly dispelled."
    Next, he answered our questions. He talked about his personal resume, his family situation, the process of joining the U.S. Air Force, all the way to the detailed circumstances of his listening to germ warfare lectures at the U.S. Air Force base ground school in Gunsan, Korea. He described the lecturer, Asifork, in this way:
    "The person who gave us the germ warfare lecture was a Mr. Asifork. I heard that he came from Japan. He was about forty years old, about five feet ten inches tall, not very thin, his hair had mostly fallen out, he was wearing a gray civilian suit, and he was wearing glasses. From his accent and various appearances, I firmly believe that he is an American."
    He said that Asifork told them at the beginning that germ warfare was very important. Later, he talked about the types, structures, and uses of germ weapons, the types of germ-carrying insects and small animals, and the prevention methods in case the bacteria spread to the U.S. military, etc. He talked the most about the types, structures, and dropping methods of germ bombs. Quinn also used gestures to show the shapes of various germ bombs in the photos that Asifork showed them, explaining one by one how the various germ bombs broke open, releasing germ-carrying insects and scattering germ-carrying dust. He also mentioned that he had also attended a lecture on atomic bombs. That night, because it was already 10:30, we did not want to disturb their normal life order, and the conversation was temporarily adjourned.
    The next morning, we continued to talk with Quinn about the detailed process of his two times dropping germ bombs in Korea. He answered the questions we raised to the best of his memory. He first talked about the process of dropping four germ bombs on January 4. At 1:05 that morning, he and navigator Lieutenant Rogers and mechanic Sergeant Sayer all went to the operations section of the squadron. In the duty officer's cabin of the duty officer Reynolds, Captain Reynolds said to him:
    "Today you have a special mission."
    "What is the special mission?" he asked.
    Reynolds was about thirty years old, about five feet tall, with blue eyes and brown hair. After hearing Quinn's question, he immediately replied:
    "There are four bombs hanging under the wing. You should drop these bombs as close as possible to the Pyongyang area, at an altitude of two hundred feet or even lower."
    At that time, he was a little strange, because according to what he knew, dropping 500-pound bombs at such a low altitude would endanger the safety of the aircraft itself. The safe altitude for general aircraft bombing is about 1,200 feet. Therefore, he explained his doubts to the duty officer. But Reynolds told him: "You don't have to worry, these bombs will not explode." And he specifically told him to report the dropping of these four "non-exploding bombs" when he returned. He said that at that time he thought that what he was going to drop was a germ bomb. Because he remembered Asifork saying that germ bombs do not explode, and he also heard other pilots and navigators say in their usual chats that their operations officers also told them that "non-exploding bombs" are germ bombs. After coming out of the operations section, he walked to the plane and saw a guard watching there. During the inspection of the aircraft, he found that these "non-exploding bombs" had no fuzes. After taking off, he dropped these bombs at the altitude specified by the operations officer, and they did not explode. Therefore, he was completely sure that what he had dropped were germ bombs.
    After he finished talking about this mission, he then talked about the process of the second time dropping germ bombs, the content of which was roughly the same. A day or two after our conversation with him ended, he wrote the content of our conversation into a written material and handed it over to us.
    Our conversation with Enok was also conducted under the same circumstances.
    After the group talks ended, our joint interrogation team conducted another collective interrogation of Enok and Quinn. On this day, both of them were wearing brand-new blue cloth clothes and had specially shaved their faces. The conversation was unrestrained. Enok was younger than Quinn and did not have a beard. He looked a little fatter, and it could be seen from his complexion that he was very healthy. They both answered our questions one by one and were willing to film the interrogation process into a documentary film.

    美国空军战俘奎恩和伊纳克的讯问
    本报记者    林洪
    作为“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”的成员，我亲自参加了美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的讯问工作。由于这两个俘虏毫无顾虑地供述了在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的详细经过，我们大约用了两个星期的时间就顺利地完成了自己的工作。
    在讯问之前，朝中人民军队战俘营管理处的负责人，还有终日和伊纳克、奎恩生活在一起的翻译同志，都详细地向我们介绍了他们两人供认投掷细菌弹的经过情形。
    伊纳克和奎恩到达战俘营之初，和其他一般美国战俘的表现很不相同。特别是问到他们是否投掷过细菌弹时，更显出十分惊慌和心神不安。战俘营的管理当局，本着宽大待遇和尊重俘虏人格的原则，并未采用任何强迫的方式继续追问，而是反复地耐心地对他们解释我方对待俘虏的政策，向他们指出：过去如果在美国战争贩子的欺骗下，在朝鲜和中国投掷过细菌弹，那本来是违反国际公法和人道原则的严重犯罪行为；但只要能够诚心悔过，谈出全部事实，一定会受到宽大处理。同时在生活上也给了他们和其他战俘同样的待遇，发给他们足够的食物和用品。这种人道待遇，使他们两人深受感动，终于解除了顾虑，供认了在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的经过。
    翻译同志告诉我们，伊纳克和奎恩供认投掷过细菌弹以后，都好像卸下了沉重的负担似的，精神立刻轻松愉快起来。在第一次为伊纳克拍完电影时，他还笑着对翻译同志说：“很遗憾，今天拍电影没有同时录音，我希望今后这样作。”我们联合讯问团的全体同志开会研究了这些情况，大家认为这两个战俘既然已经完全自愿地承认了投掷细菌弹前后的主要事实，已经没有什么重大的思想顾虑，于是决定立刻分组和他们谈话，以后再进行集体讯问。
    我们和这两个战俘谈话时，采取了极为随便的谈话方式。每一次都是伊纳克或奎恩和我们共同围坐在一起，大家一面喝水、抽烟，一面毫无拘束地谈话。我们除了问到他们受细菌战训练和投掷细菌弹的经过情形以外，也问到他们的家庭生活和被俘后的感想。我们第一次和奎恩谈话是在一个夜晚。我们和朝中两国的几个专家一同走上一个半山坡，在一间小屋子的前面停下来。这间用木料建成的屋子有一丈多长，一丈多宽。屋里正闪耀着明亮的灯光。同行的朝鲜同志告诉我，在目前战争的情况下，能够住这样的屋子是很不容易的。我们看见屋子的一边放着一个长方形的木桌，上面摆着几本书，一包中国出产的香烟，一碗吃剩了的鱼，还有一些零星用品。在屋内另一面的炕席上，有两个差不多同样大小的睡铺，都有棉被、毯子等物。靠里面的一个睡铺是奎恩的，旁边摆着他原来的美国空军制服，另一个睡铺是翻译周道同志的。那天晚上，奎恩穿着一件美国空军用的黄色毛衣，脚上是一双皮靴。他留着一小撮略带棕色的胡须，脸色红润，样子显得很健康。当翻译周道同志向他说明我们的来意后，他立刻高兴地让我们进到屋里，并和周道同志一起急忙卷起被盖等物。因为坐位不够，我们多数人都围坐在炕席上。
    谈话开始，我们先问了一些他被俘后的感想。他回答说：
    “自从我被俘以后，就受到很好的待遇，这使我非常惊奇。我不但得到日常必需品，而且还得到奢侈品，如香烟、糖果等。我在被俘以后，觉得可能受到刑罚；但是，这种顾虑很快就打消了。”
    接下去，他回答我们的问题。谈到他个人的简历，家庭的情况，参加美国空军的经过，一直到他在朝鲜群山美国空军基地地面学校听细菌战讲课的详细情形。他这样形容当时的讲课人阿西福克：
    “那次给我们讲细菌战课的是个叫阿西福克的先生。我听说他是从日本来的。他约有四十多岁，五英尺十英寸高，人不很瘦，头发已经大部脱落，穿着一身灰色的平民服，带着一副眼镜。从他的口音和种种外形来看，我十分相信他是一个美国人。”
    他说，阿西福克一开始就告诉他们，细菌战是很重要的。以后就讲到了细菌武器的种类、构造和使用方法，带菌昆虫和小动物的种类，以及细菌万一延及美国的军队时的预防方法等等。讲得最多的是细菌弹的种类、构造和投掷方法。奎恩还特别用手势比划了阿西福克给他们看的照片上的各种细菌弹的形状，逐一说明了各种细菌弹怎样破裂开，从中放出带菌昆虫，撒下带菌尘埃。他也谈到他还听过一次关于原子弹的讲课。那天晚上因为时间已经十点半，我们不愿妨害他们正常的生活秩序，谈话就暂告一段落。
    第二天上午，我们又和奎恩继续谈话，内容是他两次在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的详细经过。他就所能记忆的，一一回答了我们所提出的问题。他先谈到一月四日投掷四枚细菌弹的经过。那天早上一点零五分钟，他和领航员罗吉士中尉、机械士赛尔军曹，都到了大队部作战科。在值夜班的作战官的小屋子里，值班雷诺兹上尉对他说：
    “今天你有一个特殊的任务。”
    “是什么特殊的任务？”他这样问。
    雷诺兹大约三十岁，约五英尺多高，蓝色眼睛，棕色头发。他听到奎恩的问话以后，立刻回答说：
    “在机翼下挂有四个炸弹，你应该尽可能地在靠近平壤的地区，在二百英尺、甚至更低一点的高度，先把这几枚炸弹投下去。”
    当时他有点奇怪，因为根据他所知道的，在这样低的高度投下五百磅的炸弹，是会危及飞机本身的安全的，一般飞机投弹的安全高度是一千二百英尺左右。因此他对值班的作战官说明了他的怀疑。但是雷诺兹告诉他：“你不用管，这些炸弹是不会爆炸的。”并特别叮嘱他回来时要汇报这四个“不爆炸的炸弹”的投掷情况。他说，那时他就想到所要投掷的就是细菌弹。因为他记得阿西福克说过，细菌弹是不爆炸的，而且也听到其他的驾驶员和领航员平常在闲谈中说过，他们的作战官也告诉过他们，“不爆炸的炸弹”就是细菌弹。从作战科出来，他走向飞机，看见一个卫兵在那里看守。在检查飞机时，他发现这几个“不爆炸的炸弹”都没有信管。起飞后，他按照作战官规定的高度投下这些炸弹以后，果然都并未爆炸。于是，他完全肯定了他所投掷的就是细菌弹。
    他谈完这一次的任务以后，接着谈了第二次投掷细菌弹的经过情形，内容大致相同。在我们和他的谈话结束后的一两天，他把和我们谈话的内容写成书面材料，交给了我们。
    我们和伊纳克的谈话，也是在同样的情形下进行的。
    在分组谈话结束后，我们联合讯问团又分别对伊纳克和奎恩进行了一次集体讯问。这一天他们两人都穿着崭新的蓝布衣服，特别刮了脸，谈话毫不拘束。伊纳克的年龄比奎恩小，没有留胡须，显得稍胖一些，从脸色上也可以看出是很健康的。他们两人一一回答了我们的问题，并且愿意把讯问经过拍成纪录电影。
