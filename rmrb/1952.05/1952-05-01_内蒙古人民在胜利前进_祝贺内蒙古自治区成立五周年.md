The People of Inner Mongolia Advance Victoriously
——Congratulating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on May 1, 1947, and it has been five years now. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people of Inner Mongolia have worked hard to overcome difficulties and build a happy life, and have already made great achievements. This is a brilliant victory for Chairman Mao's ethnic policy.

Chairman Mao's ethnic policy has closely united the people of Inner Mongolia with the people of all ethnic groups in China. Under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, the people of Inner Mongolia have established their own political power in accordance with the principle of national regional autonomy. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was elected by the people's congress of Inner Mongolia itself. Among the eighteen government members headed by Chairman Ulanhu, fifteen are Mongolian. The representatives in the People's Representative Conference include workers, farmers, herdsmen, women, intellectuals, industrialists and businessmen, lamas, and former princes, encompassing all ethnic groups and all classes. The minority nationalities in the autonomous region, such as the Oroqen and Solon, in addition to participating in the political power in mixed residential areas, have also established their own banner or Nutuk autonomous people's governments in concentrated residential areas.

The establishment of the Inner Mongolia National Regional Autonomous government has realized the close unity and friendly cooperation of the people of all ethnic groups, and has brought into play the patriotism and construction enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups.

The people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region bravely participated in the War of Liberation and steadily implemented various necessary reforms. The Inner Mongolia People's Army cooperated with the people to suppress bandits and eliminate special agents, consolidating the public security in the Inner Mongolia area.

Since 1948, the people of Inner Mongolia have launched a large-scale production campaign, which has increased grain production beyond pre-liberation levels; the number of livestock has increased significantly compared to 1945, with some areas increasing by more than double. Other production undertakings and cooperative economies have also developed considerably.

With the restoration and development of the economy, the people's cultural and educational undertakings have also gradually developed. In the era of reactionary rule, the people of Inner Mongolia were in a state of cultural decline and population decrease. Now, the number of children enrolled in school in Inner Mongolia accounts for more than 61 percent of the total number of school-age children, an increase of about three times compared to the puppet Manchukuo period. The Mongolian language and writing are developing. The plague and syphilis, which seriously endanger the health of the people of Inner Mongolia, have been basically eradicated, and the latter is undergoing key prevention and treatment. In the prevention and treatment areas, the population has been increasing day by day. This is a particularly gratifying event for the Inner Mongolian people.

Last year, Inner Mongolia suffered a fairly widespread and severe drought. Thanks to the efforts of the people of Inner Mongolia to produce and help themselves, they finally smoothly weathered the famine. In order to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and support the Chinese People's Volunteers, the people of Inner Mongolia enthusiastically launched a production increase and donation campaign, fully demonstrating the great patriotism of the people of Inner Mongolia.

Since January of this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has widely and deeply launched the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, which have yielded great results. This will enable the various construction undertakings in Inner Mongolia to develop more soundly in the future.

The important achievements of the people of Inner Mongolia in the past five years have provided a good example for all minority nationalities in China. The victory of the people of Inner Mongolia is not only the victory of the people of Inner Mongolia, but also the victory of the people of all nationalities in China. The people of all nationalities in China will cheer for the victory of the people of Inner Mongolia and for the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy.

　　内蒙古人民在胜利前进
    ——祝贺内蒙古自治区成立五周年
    内蒙古自治区成立于一九四七年五月一日，到现在已经五周年。五年来，内蒙人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导下，努力克服困难，建设幸福的生活，已经有了很大的成就。这是毛主席民族政策的光辉胜利。
    毛主席的民族政策，使内蒙人民和中华各民族人民紧密地团结在一起，在中央人民政府的统一领导下，内蒙人民根据民族区域自治的原则，建立了自己的政权。内蒙古自治区人民政府是经过内蒙人民自己的代表大会选举的，在以乌兰夫主席为首的十八名政府委员中有十五人是蒙族。人民代表会议中的代表、有工人、农民、牧民、妇女、知识分子、工商界人士、喇嘛以及过去的王公等，包括了各民族、各阶层。自治区内的少数民族，如鄂伦春、索伦等族，除在杂居区参加政权外，并在聚居区建立了他们自己的旗或努图克自治区人民政府。
    内蒙古民族区域自治政权的建立，实现了各民族人民的亲密团结和友爱合作，发挥了各民族人民的爱国主义热情和建设的积极性。
    内蒙古自治区人民曾英勇地参加了解放战争，稳步地实行了各种必要的改革。内蒙人民军队协同人民剿灭土匪、肃清特务，使内蒙地区的治安得以巩固。
    从一九四八年以来，内蒙人民就开展了大规模的生产运动，使粮食的产量超过了解放前的水平；牲畜数字较一九四五年有很大增加，有些地区已增加了一倍以上。其他生产事业和合作经济也有了相当的发展。
    随着经济的恢复和发展，人民的文化教育事业也逐步地发展起来。在反动统治时代，内蒙人民曾陷于文化衰退、人口减少的状态。现在，内蒙入学的儿童已占学龄儿童总数的百分之六十一以上，较伪满时期增加了约三倍。蒙古的语言文字在发展着。严重危害内蒙人民健康的鼠疫和梅毒，前者基本上已被扑灭，后者正进行重点防治。在防治地区内，人口已日益增加。这对于内蒙古民族来说，是一件特别值得庆幸的喜事。
    去年，内蒙古曾遭遇相当普遍的严重的旱灾，由于内蒙人民努力生产自救，终于平稳地度过了灾荒。内蒙人民为了加强抗美援朝的工作，支援中国人民志愿军，踊跃地开展了增产捐献运动，充分地表现出内蒙古人民伟大的爱国主义精神。
    今年一月以来，内蒙古自治区广泛而深入地展开了“三反”“五反”运动，收获很大。这将使内蒙古今后的各项建设事业得以更加健全地发展。
    内蒙人民五年来的重要成就，向中国各少数民族提供了良好的榜样。内蒙人民的胜利，不仅是内蒙人民的，同时也是中国各民族人民的。中国各民族人民都将为内蒙人民的胜利而欢呼，为毛主席民族政策的光辉胜利而欢呼。
