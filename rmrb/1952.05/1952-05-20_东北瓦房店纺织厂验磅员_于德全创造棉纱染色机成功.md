To the Editor: Yu Dequan, a weight checker at the processing workshop of the Northeast Wafangdian Textile Factory, has always been active in his work. Every time he worked at the bleaching and dyeing field, he felt that manual operation for cotton yarn dyeing resulted in uneven quality and significant waste. He thought, "I am a member of the working class, and I should find ways to save resources for the country." Therefore, starting in October last year, he used his spare time to research and create a dyeing machine. He looked for parts everywhere and found maintenance workers and technicians in the workshop to form a special dyeing machine research group, and everyone studied together. During the creation process, he encountered many difficulties because of his low educational level. However, he was not afraid. Sometimes he did not eat or sleep to find solutions. With the help of the workshop director and technicians, he finally succeeded in creating the dyeing machine on April 20 this year. According to preliminary tests, each person can oversee two dyeing machines, and the output is tripled compared to before. It can create the equivalent of ninety-two tons of grain wealth for the country annually.

    东北瓦房店纺织厂验磅员
    于德全创造棉纱染色机成功
    编辑同志：东北瓦房店纺织厂加工车间验磅员于德全，工作一贯积极。他每次到漂染场工作时，都觉得棉纱染色用人力操作，染出来的物品质量不均匀，浪费又很大。他想：“我是工人阶级的一分子，应当想办法为国家节约”。于是，从去年十月开始，他利用业余时间研究创造染色机。他到处找零件，并找车间保全工和技术人员，组成专门研究染色机小组，大家一同研究。他在创造过程中，因为文化水平低，碰到好多困难。但是他不畏惧，有时饭也不吃、觉也不睡地想办法；加上车间主任和技术人员的帮助，终于在今年四月二十日创造染色机成功了。据初步试验，每人可以看两台染色机，产量较前增加三倍。全年能为国家创造九十二吨粮食的财富。　顾天才
