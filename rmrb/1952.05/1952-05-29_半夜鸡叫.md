Midnight Rooster's Crow
Gao YuBao

Editor's Note: Under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, mass literary and artistic activities have greatly developed, and some outstanding young writers from worker, peasant, and soldier backgrounds have emerged. Gao YuBao is one of them. He is twenty-six years old this year, grew up in a poor peasant family, herded pigs and cattle as a child, and suffered from landlord oppression. Later, he became a coal miner. In 1947, he joined the People's Liberation Army and then joined the Communist Party of China. After he went to the army, he began to learn to read and write, recognizing only a hundred or so characters. He continued to study with firm confidence and was determined to write his experiences into a book to educate himself and others. With the help of comrades in the army and the encouragement and cultivation of leaders, Gao YuBao finally wrote a first draft of an autobiographical novel of more than 200,000 words last year. Published here is a section of the book (originally published in "Liberation Army Literature and Art" this May). This section is equivalent to a short story. It vividly depicts the painful life of peasants under the feudal land system and their class hatred, and also portrays the ugly face of the landlord, demonstrating the peasants' wit. Gao YuBao's spirit of learning culture and the great perseverance he has shown in literary creation is a great encouragement to the millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers who are engaged in the upsurge of cultural learning.

At night, it was already very dark, and a crowd of people staggered out of the fields, these were the farmhands working for Zhou the Skinflint. Someone hummed weakly, "I'm dead tired!" Someone cursed, "That rooster is really damn weird, every night, as soon as I fall asleep, it crows. Old Zhou the Skinflint also has that stingy spirit, as soon as the rooster crows, he insists on calling us up the mountain. By the time we've worked half the day on the mountain, it's not even dawn yet." Someone said, "People with money, even the chickens are on their side, it's really good fate." Someone said, "What good fate, why didn't the rooster crow early before, and now it crows early? There must be something fishy here. Look, I'm going to beat that rooster to death." Everyone walked home, talking all the way. To get a little more sleep, the farmhands went to bed as soon as they finished eating. Some smoked, some talked. Gao YuBao had diarrhea these days, and after lying down for a short time, he got up to defecate; when he came back, he went to the cattle pen to see if there was any grass in the trough, wanting to add some more grass for the cattle so he could go back to sleep faster. Just then, he saw a fellow with a long wooden stick, tiptoeing to the chicken coop. There was no moon at night, and he couldn't see his face. Gao YuBao thought, "He's probably here to steal chickens, I should shout." Then he thought, "No, this person must be stealing chickens because his family has no other way, if I shout, won't I be hurting him? I won't make a sound. If all the chickens are stolen, they won't crow at dawn, and we'll get more sleep." Just as he was thinking this, he saw the person stretch his neck, as if holding his nose. Gao YuBao worriedly thought, "Be careful! If Zhou the Skinflint hears you and catches you, you'll be in trouble." Seeing that there was still grass in the trough, wanting to go back to sleep earlier, but afraid of disturbing the chicken thief, he thought, "If I go out, I'll scare him away, won't he have come for nothing? No, I won't disturb him, I'll watch here to see who's stealing chickens." So Gao YuBao squatted down, wanting to watch a lively chicken theft. Who knew there was no movement for a long time, but he heard the chicken thief crowing like a rooster. YuBao was puzzled, then he saw the person run towards the cattle pen again. YuBao quickly got up and hid in the straw shed. Just as the person walked to the cattle trough, he struck a match to see if there was any grass in the trough. YuBao saw by the light: "Ah! It turns out to be Zhou the Skinflint, what midnight rooster's crow, it's all the old bastard's doing!" Zhou the Skinflint's crowing was no small matter, the chickens in the coop started crowing, and all the chickens in the village also crowed. YuBao, filled with anger, didn't dare to make a sound, and then he heard Zhou the Skinflint shout in a hoarse voice: "Aren't you getting up and going to the mountain to work for me? The chickens are crowing!" After saying that, he went home to sleep. YuBao went back to the house and saw the farmhands all angrily saying, "Damn it, it doesn't crow early, it doesn't crow late, it only crows after we lie down. This chicken is really not a chicken!" Liu the foreman asked, "What's the chicken crowing for?" "Crowing for death. I think if we keep working like this, we'll be worked to death in a few days." Some said, "I just fell asleep..." Some said, "I just lay down, I haven't even finished smoking a pipe yet." YuBao thought: They don't know that this is Zhou the Skinflint's doing, so he sat down and said, "We're in luck, we haven't even taken off our clothes yet, let's go quickly, I have a joke to tell you." Everyone hurriedly put on their clothes and carried their hoes up the mountain. On the way, everyone asked YuBao: "What joke? Tell us quickly." YuBao smiled, widened his small black eyes, and said: "Uncles, don't curse the chicken anymore, you can't blame the chicken, you have to blame the person." Everyone asked strangely: "What's going on?" YuBao told his uncles all about Zhou the Skinflint imitating the rooster's crow. When Liu the foreman heard this, he was so angry that he glared and said: "I'm not working tonight, I'm going to sleep at the field." Everyone agreed. Everyone looked at the dim stars in the sky, walked to the field, put down their hoes, lit a pipe, and fell to the ground, fast asleep. How tired they were, the big dew wet their clothes, but they didn't even know it. This rooster crowing is the old Zhou family's secret weapon for getting rich. Since Zhou the Skinflint's great-grandfather's time, people have heard that the Zhou family has this trick, and it has been passed down to Zhou the Skinflint's generation. This way, when the third weeding is almost finished, the farmhands will be exhausted and run away; then they will get what they want, and in the autumn they won't give any grain at all.

The farmhands were lying on the field, sleeping soundly, when suddenly they felt pain all over their bodies, "Ouch!" they cried and got up, seeing that the sun had risen a man's height. Zhou the Skinflint was holding a walking stick, hitting them hard one by one, beating the farmhands until they all got up. Zhou the Skinflint glared with his triangular eyes and said: "You eat my food, earn my grain, and this is how you work for me? You don't work, you come here to sleep, if you don't finish weeding this piece of land this morning, don't even think about eating." He turned to the cowherd and said: "Take the food back to my house."

It turned out that Zhou the Skinflint had gotten up early, seeing that the farmhands hadn't come home for dinner yet, he thought: "The farmhands must still be rushing to work for me, why don't I have someone send them the food, let them eat on the mountain, so they don't waste time going back and forth, so they can weed more land for me." So he went to the street and found Old Li, the cowherd in the village, to carry the food to the mountain. Who knew that when he got to the mountain, he saw the farmhands sleeping there, and they hadn't done any work for him. He was so angry that he beat the farmhands with his walking stick, and he didn't even give the farmhands food to eat, so he told Old Li to carry it back to his house. After Old Li left, he cursed for a while before leaving.

The farmhands saw Zhou the Skinflint beating and cursing, and not even giving them food to eat. Some were so angry that they were determined not to do this work anymore; some wanted to go back and settle accounts with him; some wanted to go home right away. YuBao smiled and quickly stopped them, saying: "Uncles, I don't think you should leave. I have a way: Let's all vent our anger and give that old bastard a beating." Someone said: "YuBao, are you crazy? He has money and power, and he's also the village chief, now he's our local emperor, how dare we touch him?" Liu Wanzhong laughed and said: "This little guy really has a good idea." "Uncles, I'm not crazy, I think you're really confused, he doesn't let us sleep every night, he probably wants to work us to death. I often hear Uncle Yang tell stories saying 'Strike first to gain the upper hand, strike later and suffer.' Wouldn't it be good for us to teach him a lesson like this?" Everyone laughed and said: "Okay, let's do it that way." When they went home for dinner at noon, Zhou the Skinflint was still cursing, but everyone didn't say anything and just let it pass.

Two or three days later, the farmhands had prepared all the sticks. After dinner, they turned off the lights and told YuBao to secretly watch behind the door. After waiting for more than an hour, Zhou the Skinflint tiptoed to the chicken coop door. YuBao shouted: "There's a thief!" The farmhands ran out with sticks and knocked old Zhou the Skinflint down and started beating him. Zhou the Skinflint said: "Don't beat me, it's me." The farmhands said: "We're beating you. See if you come to steal chickens again!" YuBao ran to the middle of the courtyard and shouted: "Village Chief, get up quickly, there's a thief, we caught a thief!" This shout was no small matter, the Japanese officer was sleeping in the house, heard it, and ran out with two guards holding pistols, shouting as he ran: "Don't keep any bandits, kill them all." The village chief's wife and son, Taoqi, heard it in the house and were so scared that they shouted: "Don't shoot,..." Before they could finish speaking, the Japanese officer "哒哒" shot old Zhou the Skinflint twice, Zhou the Skinflint cried "Ouch!" and plunged into the chicken coop. The Japanese officer caught up and was about to shoot again. The village chief's wife, half-naked, ran out in a panic, holding up her trousers, and said: "He's the village chief." Only then did the Japanese officer stop. The farmhands hurried up and said: "The village chief has never been to the chicken coop door before, why is he here in the middle of the night to catch chickens. Quickly bring a light and take a look." Taoqi took a lamp out of the house and looked, ah! The two shots hit the village chief's thigh squarely, and blood was flowing. Zhou the Skinflint was like a wild pheasant on a mountain, caring about his head but not his rear, his head was stretched into the chicken coop, as if he wanted to eat chicken droppings. Everyone pulled him out and saw that his face was covered in chicken droppings, and he sat there holding his leg and shouting. The farmhands were so happy that they couldn't help laughing. Liu the foreman said: "We all thought it was a thief, it turned out to be the village chief. Why are you catching chickens in the middle of the night?" The village chief said in a sobbing voice: "Don't mention it, I was sleeping soundly at home, I don't know what pulled me here." Everyone hurriedly said: "Look how dangerous that was. Maybe it's a ghost! You have to pay more attention in the future!" After saying that, everyone carried him into the house, the Japanese officer called a doctor to look at him, his bone was broken, and he quickly bandaged his leg. Old Zhou the Skinflint was unlucky and frustrated, unable to say all the words in his stomach, and dared not go to the chicken coop again, nor could he go to the fields.

    半夜鸡叫
    高玉宝
    编者按：在毛泽东文艺思想的指导下，群众性的文艺活动有了很大的开展，并且出现了一些出色的工农兵出身的青年作家，高玉宝就是其中之一。他今年二十六岁，生长在一个贫农的家庭里，小时候放猪放牛，受尽地主压迫，后来当了煤矿工人。一九四七年参加人民解放军，接着加入了中国共产党。他到军队以后，才开始学文化，认识了百来个字。他抱着坚定的信心继续学习，并决心要把他的经历写成一本书，来教育自己和别人。经过部队同志们的帮助和领导方面的鼓励培养，高玉宝终于在去年写成了一部长达二十余万字的自传体小说初稿。这里刊登的就是书中的一节（原载“解放军文艺”本年五月号）。这一节等于一个短篇小说，它生动地描写了封建土地制度下农民的苦痛生活和他们的阶级仇恨，同时也画出了地主的丑恶面貌，表现了农民的机智。高玉宝学习文化的精神和他在文艺创作上所表现的巨大毅力，对于千千万万投入文化学习热潮中的工农兵，是一个极大的鼓舞力量。
    晚上，天已很黑，地里走出了累得晃晃荡荡的人群，这是给周剥皮作活的伙计们。有谁在哼声爬气地说：“困死我了！”有谁骂起来：“那公鸡真他妈的怪，每天晚上，才睡着它就叫了。老周剥皮他也有那个穷精神，鸡一叫他就非喊咱们上山不可。到山上干半天，天也不亮。”有的说：“人家有钱，鸡也向他，这真是命好呀。”有的说：“什么命好命歹，为什么以前鸡不叫的早，现在就叫的早呢？这里一定有鬼。看，我非把那个公鸡给打死不可。”大家你一言，我一语地走回家去。为了多睡点觉，伙计们回去一吃完饭就躺下了，有的抽烟，有的说话。高玉宝这几天拉肚子，躺下不大时间，就起来去大便；回来时，到牛圈去看牛槽有没有草，想再给牛添点草就快点回去睡觉。正在这时，他见一个家伙手拿长木棍，轻手轻脚地走到鸡屋边，晚上又没有月亮，也看不见脸面。高玉宝心想：“怕是来偷鸡的，喊吧。”又想：“不，这人一定家中没有办法了才来偷鸡，我要喊了，不就坑了他了吗？我不出声。把鸡都偷走，就不用啼明了，我们还多睡点觉呢。”正想着，又见那人伸起脖子，像用手扪住了鼻子。高玉宝很担心地想：“小心点呀！叫周剥皮听见，把你抓起来就坏了。”看看牛槽里还有草，想早点回去睡觉，又怕惊动了偷鸡的人。心想：“我要出去，把他吓跑了，他不是白来一趟吗？不，不惊动他，我在这看看，是谁来偷鸡。”高玉宝就蹲下，要看个偷的热闹。谁知好半天没动静，倒听到偷鸡的学公鸡啼起明来。玉宝正在纳闷，只见那人又奔牛圈走来，玉宝忙起来藏到草屋子里，正好那人走到牛槽边，划了一根洋火，看看槽里有没有草。玉宝就着火光一看：“啊！原来是周剥皮，半夜三更什么鸡叫，原来都是老家伙搞的鬼！”周剥皮这一啼明不要紧，笼里鸡叫唤起来，全屯的鸡也都叫唤起来。玉宝别着一肚子气没敢出声，又听到周剥皮破着喉咙喊：“还不起来给我上山干活去？鸡都叫了！”说完就回家睡觉去了。玉宝走回屋一看，伙计们都气呼呼地说：“他妈的，早也不叫，晚也不叫，才躺下就叫了。这个鸡真不叫鸡！”刘打头的问：“不知鸡叫什么？”“叫催命鬼呗。我看这样干，再干几天就得累死。”有的说：“我才睡……”有的说：“我躺下，一袋烟还没抽完呢。”玉宝心想：他们还不知道这是周剥皮搞的鬼呢，就坐下说：“咱们可省事了，连衣服还没脱下来，快走吧，我有一个笑话对你们讲。”大家忙问：“玉宝，有什么笑话？你快说。”“不，我现在不说，等到路上再说。”大家忙披好衣服，扛着锄头上山。在路上，大伙又问玉宝：“什么笑话？你快说。”玉宝笑了笑，瞪起小黑眼珠说：“叔叔，你们再别骂鸡，那不能怨鸡，是怨人呀。”大家奇怪地问：“怎么回事？”玉宝就把周剥皮学鸡啼明的事全告诉了叔叔们。刘打头的一听这话，气得直瞪着眼说：“今天晚上不干了，到地头去睡觉去。”大家都同意。大家都看着空中不明的星星，走到了地头，放下锄头，打火抽了一袋烟，倒在地上就呼呼地睡了。人困的多厉害呀，那么大的露水，湿了他们的衣服，全都不知道呀。这个学鸡叫，是他们老周家起家的法宝呀。从周剥皮的老祖太爷子起，就有人听说过周家有这一手，一直传到周剥皮这一辈。这样到三遍地快铲完时，把伙计们累跑了；他们就得着了，到秋天便一点粮也不给呀。
    伙计们躺在地头上，正睡得甜蜜，忽然觉着身上疼，“哎呀”一声就爬起来，看看太阳出来有一人高了，周剥皮拿着文明棍，狠狠地挨着个儿打呀，把伙计们打得全都爬起来了。周剥皮瞪着三角眼说：“你们吃我的饭，挣我的粮，就这样给我干活？活不干，到这里来睡觉，今天上午不把这一块地给我铲完，就别想吃饭。”回头对牛倌说：“把饭给我担回去。”
    原来周剥皮起得早，见伙计们还没回家吃饭，他想：“伙计们还一定给我赶活呢，我何不叫人把饭给他们送去，叫他们在山上吃了，省得来回走耽误工夫，好多给我铲点地。”他就到街上，把屯里放牛的老李头找来，给他担着饭，向山上送。谁想一到山上，见伙计们在那睡觉，一点活也没给他干，气得拿文明棍把伙计们打了一顿，饭也不给伙计们吃，就叫老李头给他再担回去。老李头走后，他又骂了一气才走。
    伙计们见周剥皮又打又骂，连饭都不给吃，有的气得坚决不干这个活了；有的要回去找他算账；有的当时就要回家。玉宝笑着忙拉住他们说：“叔叔，我看你们不要走。我有一个办法：咱们大家出出气，把那老小子打一顿就好了。”有人说：“玉宝，你这孩子傻了怎的？人家有钱有势力，又当保长，现在是咱们这里的二朝廷，我们敢动人家一下子吗？”刘万忠笑道：“这小家伙真有好办法。”“叔叔，我没傻，我看你们真糊涂，他每天夜里不让咱们睡觉，他可能想把咱们累死吧，我常听杨叔叔讲故事说‘先下手为强，后下手遭殃’。咱们这般如此地教训他一顿不好吗？”大家一听，都哈哈大笑起来说：“好好，就这样办。”晌午回家吃饭时，周剥皮还骂呢，大家也没说什么，就过去了。
    过了两三天，伙计们把棒子全准备好了。吃完晚饭，把灯熄了，叫玉宝在门后偷着看。等了有一个多钟头的工夫，周剥皮蹑手蹑脚，刚到鸡屋门口。玉宝喊了声：“有贼！”伙计们拿着棒子都跑出来，把老周剥皮捺倒就打起来。周剥皮说：“别打呀，是我。”伙计们说：“打的就是你。看你再来不来偷鸡！”玉宝跑到院子中间喊：“保长呀，快起来，有贼啦，我们抓着一个贼！”这一喊不要紧，鬼子军官正在屋里睡，听见了，他带了两个护兵拿着手枪就跑出来，边跑边喊：“毛贼一个也不要，通统打死。”保长老婆和儿子淘气在屋里听见了，吓的忙喊：“别打呀，……”下面的话还没说出来呢，鬼子军官“哒哒”照着老周剥皮就是两枪，周剥皮“哎呀”了一声说：“是我！”一头就钻进了鸡屋里。鬼子军官赶上一步又要开枪。保长老婆光着上身，提着裤子慌慌张张地跑出来说：“他是保长。”鬼子才住了手。伙计们忙围上说：“保长从来也没到鸡屋门口过，为什么今天深更半夜的来抓鸡呢。快拿灯来看看。”淘气从屋里拿出灯来一看，啊！这两枪正正打在保长的大腿上，直流血。周剥皮好像大山上的野鸡一样，顾头不顾腚了，他头伸在鸡屋里，好像要吃鸡屎的样子。大家把他拉出来一看，满脸全是鸡屎，坐在那里抱着腿直叫唤。伙计们高兴得也不好笑出来。刘打头的说：“我们都当是贼呢，搞了半天是保长。你为什么半夜来抓鸡呢？”保长哭叽叽的声音说：“别提啦，我在家睡个二二呼呼的，也不知什么东西把我拉来了。”大家忙说：“看这多危险。也可能闹鬼吧！以后可得多注意！”说完，大家把他抬到屋里，鬼子军官叫来了医生给他一看，骨头打坏了，忙把腿包上。老周剥皮倒霉丧气，一肚子的话说不出来，再也不敢去鸡屋了，也不能下地了。
