     Qixian Water Conservancy Bureau and Changyuan River Water Conservancy Committee
    Self-Criticism Regarding the Incident of a Migrant Worker Being Killed in the Changyuan River Canal Project
    Editor: Wang Jinshan's letter, published in the Readers' Letters column of the People's Daily on April 17th, criticized the cadres of the Qixian Water Conservancy Bureau for abandoning leadership in the Changyuan River Canal project, leading to the incident of a migrant worker being killed. This criticism is completely correct. After seeing this stern criticism, we convened all cadres for discussion and self-criticism. Everyone unanimously believed that the main cause of this tragic incident was the bureaucratic work style of the leading comrades of the Qixian Water Conservancy Bureau and the Changyuan River Water Conservancy Committee, and the paralysis of thought of the cadres specifically responsible for the Changyuan River Canal project. In the construction process, our inspection and guidance of the Gongli Canal and Longji Canal projects of the Changyuan River were very insufficient. We have long been unaware of the lesson that villagers from Dahan damaged a wheelbarrow due to the method of digging holes in the canal walls to transport earth. The cadres specifically responsible for leading the Gongli and Longji canal projects were negligent and did not consider the dangerous practice of digging holes in the canal walls to be a serious problem. Therefore, they neither stopped it nor reported it to higher authorities, resulting in a lack of communication between higher and lower levels. In addition, the division of labor between the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Changyuan River Water Conservancy Committee was not clear, and there was a phenomenon of mutual reliance. In short, we adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the lives of the masses. The bloody lesson tells us how much harm it can do to the masses to do work purely for the sake of completing tasks! In addition to conducting a deep self-criticism and ensuring that similar incidents will not occur in the future, we also request the higher-level government to impose penalties.

     祁县水利科和昌源河水利委员会
    对昌源河渠工程中砸死民工事件的检讨
    编辑同志：四月十七日人民日报读者来信栏发表了王金山同志的来信，批评祁县水利科领导昌源河渠工程的干部放弃领导，酿成砸死民工事件，这个批评是完全正确的。看到这一严正的批评后，我们就召集全体干部进行了讨论和检讨。大家一致认为，这次惨痛事件发生的主要原因，是祁县水利科和昌源河水利委员会领导同志的官僚主义作风和具体负责昌源河渠工程的干部的麻痹思想造成的。在施工过程中，我们对昌源河的公利渠和龙济渠两个工程的检查与指导工作做得十分不够，我们对大韩村民工因采用渠壁挖洞运土的办法，砸坏一辆手推车的教训，长期都不知道。具体负责领导公利、龙济两干渠工程的干部，麻痹大意，不认为渠壁挖洞的危险做法是个严重问题，因此既不加以制止，也不向上汇报，致使上下不通气。另外水利科和昌源河水利委员会分工不明确，有互相依靠现象。总之，我们对群众的生命是采取了不负责任的态度的。血的教训告诉我们，单纯为了完成任务而去做工作，给群众的危害有多么大！我们除深刻检讨，保证今后不再有类似事件发生外，并请求上级政府给予处分。
