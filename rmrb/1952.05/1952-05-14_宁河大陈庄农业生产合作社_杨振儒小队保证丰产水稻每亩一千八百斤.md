    Yang Zhenru Team Guarantees a Bumper Rice Harvest of 1,800 Jin Per Mu
    Respected Chairman Mao: Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we created a bumper rice harvest of 1,620 jin per mu in 1951 and received an award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. We feel very honored.
    During the period of Japanese occupation and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, our suffering was truly endless. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries conscripted soldiers, seized grain, and raped women, making it impossible for us to live at home. At that time, our village of more than eighty households was reduced to only forty-four.
    On December 13, 1948, our village was liberated. Chairman Mao, you rescued us from deep water and scorching fire. In the autumn of 1949, our area was suffering from a major flood. The People's Government led us to engage in sideline production and provided us with loans and grain, enabling us to survive the biggest flood we had seen in decades. In 1950, the People's Government lent us seeds and fertilizers and helped us use electric-powered irrigation equipment to water the land. We turned 510 mu of alkaline wasteland, which had not grown seedlings for years, into paddy fields. In 1951, we reclaimed another 240 mu of wasteland and turned it into paddy fields. Our lives have become better and better. Under the active leadership of the People's Government, sixty-eight households formed an agricultural production cooperative, divided into nine teams. We used our years of farming experience combined with new scientific methods to achieve an average yield of 718 jin of rice per mu for the entire cooperative. Our team averaged 750 jin per mu, and in addition, we had 7.5 mu of high-yield land, which achieved the national record of 1,620 jin per mu.
    Chairman Mao, our village is now semi-electrified. We use electric-powered irrigation equipment to water the land, horses to plow the fields, electric bells have been installed in the school, and electric lights have been installed in every household. The whole village has sixteen radios. Every evening after dinner, when the farmers have finished their work and the students have finished school, songs and broadcasts intermingle. We have begun to live a happy life.
    This year, we plan to establish a nursery class to free up a large number of women laborers, further implement intensive cultivation, apply more fertilizer, diligently weed, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Now all the rice seeds have been disinfected with mercuric chloride, the seedling beds have been prepared, and windbreaks have been set up. This year, we will ensure that the seedlings are sprouted early and that rice is transplanted during the Xiaoman solar term (half a month to twenty days earlier than last year). 100,000 jin of soybean cake fertilizer has also been prepared. We guarantee that the average yield of grain per mu for the entire cooperative will be 825 jin, our team will average 1,058 jin, and the high-yield land will reach a higher record of 1,800 jin per mu. We wish you good health.

    杨振儒小队保证丰产水稻每亩一千八百斤
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在共产党和人民政府的领导下，一九五一年，创造了每亩水稻产一千六百二十斤的丰产纪录，得到了中央人民政府农业部的奖励，我们感到很光荣。
    在日寇和国民党反动统治时期，我们的苦处真是说不完。解放前，国民党反动派抓丁、抢粮、奸淫妇女，使我们在家不能生活。那时我们八十多户的村子，只逃剩四十四户了。
    一九四八年十二月十三日，我村解放了。毛主席，您把我们从水深火热中救出来了。一九四九年秋季，我们这一带正闹大水，人民政府领导我们搞副业生产，还贷款贷粮给我们，使我们度过了几十年未见过的大水灾。一九五○年人民政府贷给我们种子、肥料，并帮助我们使用电力扬水设备浇地，我们把长年不长苗的碱荒地五百一十亩开成了水田。一九五一年我们又开荒二百四十亩，并使它变成水田。我们的日子就越过越好了。在人民政府积极领导下，我们六十八户成立了农业生产合作社，共分九个小队。我们用多年的耕作经验结合新的科学方法，达到了全社每市亩平均产稻谷七百一十八斤。我队每市亩平均产七百五十斤，另外有七亩半丰产地，每市亩平均产一千六百二十斤的全国最高纪录。
    毛主席，我们村现在已经半电气化了。我们使用了电力扬水设备浇地，马拉犁耕地，学校安上了电铃，家家装上了电灯，全村共有十六台收音机。每当晚饭过后，农民干完了活，学生放了学，歌声和广播声交杂着。我们已开始过着幸福的生活。
    今年我们计划成立幼儿班，腾出大批妇女劳动力来，进一步实行精耕细作，多施肥，勤除草，防除病虫害。现在稻种完全都用水银剂消了毒，秧芽子的畦都打好了，也夹好了风帐。今年我们要作到早出秧芽子，保证小满节插秧（比去年早半月至二十天）。十万斤豆饼肥也准备好了。我们保证全社每市亩地平均产粮八百二十五斤，我们小队平均产一千○五十八斤，丰产地达到每亩产一千八百斤的更高纪录。谨祝身体健康
