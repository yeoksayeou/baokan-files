Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th: TASS, London, 18th: It has been previously reported that the US government and bourgeois newspapers are attempting to whitewash the crimes of the US commander of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, Colson, who himself admitted to massacring prisoners on Koje Island. In this regard, the Reuters report from Geneva on the 17th is particularly noteworthy. According to the Reuters correspondent in Geneva, the so-called "International" Committee of the Red Cross has released a report on the massacre of Koje Island prisoners of war by the American aggressors on February 18th of this year. Even such an organization, notorious for helping aggressors cover up war crimes and deceive public opinion, had to admit in its report that the US military authorities forcibly selected prisoners of war to participate in the interventionist army. When the prisoners protested this inhuman behavior, they were shot. The summary of the report is as follows: "At approximately 4:00 AM on February 18th, a fully armed force of about a regiment entered Camp 62 without prior notice. All the prisoners were asleep except for a few guards in the tents. The troops surrounded the other tents, including the tent of their trustee (the report refers to a prisoner leader as a trustee – TASS editor's note). They threatened the prisoners with bayonets, forbidding them from leaving the tents. One or two prisoners who didn't know what was happening tried to leave the tents and were shot... The prisoners rushed out of the tents to defend themselves and find out what was happening. The troops opened fire on them. At dawn, the trustee wanted to talk to the commander of the troops again, but was unsuccessful... A comrade of his – the leader of the third prisoner camp – tried to help him contact the commander but was also killed. At around 8:00 AM, Colonel Fitzgerald (the commander of the POW camp at the time – TASS editor’s note) arrived at the scene. In his presence, the troops fired several volleys at the prisoners who were singing. As the colonel entered the camp, there was another burst of gunfire. After several more prisoners were killed, the colonel told the prisoners to sit down. Colonel Fitzgerald repeatedly stated that he would move the troops away, but he did not do so.

　　Subsequently, the trustee requested Colonel Fitzgerald to accompany him on a tour to ascertain the actual situation. He agreed and immediately went with the trustee and the prisoner leader to observe the prisoners’ injuries and heard the loud cries for help of an injured person. They entered a heavily guarded shed near the canteen. The trustee asked for these people to be released but was refused. From here, they went into a barracks, passing by forty prisoners who sat with their hands crossed over their heads, guarded by soldiers. One of them was injured with a pistol butt. ... The soldiers would not allow the prisoners to carry the dead and wounded to the medical facility. ... The trustee saw soldiers kicking the corpses. Trucks were full of corpses, and these dead people had not been treated by doctors. The trustee believed that some of the dead were actually still alive. The trustee and the prisoners in the medical facility simply couldn't count the number of corpses."

　　The report continues to cite facts illustrating that the prisoner-of-war camp authorities used threats to force prisoners not to return to their homeland. It can be seen from the report that the bloody suppression of prisoners was caused by the prisoners protesting against the US military authorities' attempt to conduct new "screening." Regarding the conditions of the prisoner-of-war camp, the report stated: "The tents and sheds are crowded with people." "There are often not enough straw mats. And the existing straw mats are also very bad." The report also pointed out that the prisoners were fed poorly.

### 所谓红十字“国际”委员会供认美军“甄别”暴行

    所谓红十字“国际”委员会
    供认美军“甄别”暴行
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦十八日讯：前已报道，美国政府和资产阶级报纸企图洗刷为美国巨济岛战俘营长官柯尔生本人所承认的屠杀巨济岛战俘的罪迹。在这方面，十七日路透社的报道是值得特别注意的。据路透社驻日内瓦记者报道，所谓红十字“国际”委员会公布了关于美国侵略者在本年二月十八日屠杀巨济岛战俘事件的报告。甚至像这样一个无人不晓的帮助侵略者掩盖战争罪行和欺骗舆论的组织，也不得不在报告中承认美军当局用强迫的手段挑选战俘参加干涉军。当战俘们抗议这种非人道的行为时，便遭到枪杀。报告的摘要如下：“二月十八日清晨四时左右，有全副武装的部队约一个团，不经事先通知，就开进六十二号营场，当时除了几名在帐篷中守卫的人以外，所有的俘虏都在睡觉。部队包围了别的帐篷，连他们的受托人
    （报告把一名俘虏领袖称为受托人——塔斯社编者注）的帐篷也在内。他们用刺刀威胁俘虏，不准他们离开帐篷。有一两名俘虏因为不知道发生了什么事情，想走出帐篷，便遭到射击……俘虏们纷纷跑出帐篷，以便进行自卫，并弄清楚究竟发生了什么事情。部队就向他们开枪射击。黎明时，受托人想再度和部队指挥官谈一谈，但没有成功……他的一位同志——第三俘虏营的领导人，想帮助他和指挥官取得联系，结果也被打死。八时左右，费兹吉拉德上校（当时的战俘营长官——塔斯社编者注）到达出事地点。当着他的面，军队又向那些唱歌的俘虏打了几排枪。当上校进入营场的时候，又是一阵枪声。在又有几名俘虏被打死之后，上校叫俘虏们坐下。费兹吉拉德上校几次声称要把军队调开，但是却没有这样做。
    随后受托人要求费兹吉拉德上校陪同他一道巡视
    一下，以弄清实际情况。他表示同意，旋即与受托人和俘虏领袖前往观察俘虏受害情形，并听到一个受伤者的大声求助的声音。他们走进靠近食堂的警戒森严的棚房。受托人要求释放这些人，但被拒绝。从这里他们走进一个营房，在四十个俘虏身旁走过。这些俘虏两手交叉地抱着头坐着，有警卫在旁看管。他们中间有一个被手枪柄打伤。……士兵不让俘虏把被打死的和受伤的人抬到医疗所。……受托人看到士兵用脚踢死尸。卡车上装满了死尸，这些死的人并没有经医生治疗过。受托人认为，这些死人被当作死了，其实有些是还活着的。受托人和在医疗所里的俘虏简直数不清死尸的数目。”
    报告继续援引事实，说明战俘营当局用威胁的办法强迫俘虏不回祖国。从报告中可以看出，血腥镇压俘虏事件是由于战俘抗议美国军事当局企图进行新的“甄别”而引起的。谈到战俘营的情况时，报告指出：“帐篷和棚房都挤满了人。”“草垫常常不够用。而现有的草垫也是很坏的。”报告同时指出，战俘吃得很坏。
