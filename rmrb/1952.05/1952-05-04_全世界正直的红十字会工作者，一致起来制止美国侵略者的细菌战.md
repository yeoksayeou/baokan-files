    All righteous Red Cross workers worldwide, unite to stop the American aggressors' germ warfare
    By Hu Lansheng, Vice President of the Chinese Red Cross Society

    The heinous crime of large-scale germ warfare committed by the American aggressors in continuously spreading vast quantities of germ-carrying insects and poisonous substances in Korea and the broad regions of Northeast China has been confirmed by ironclad evidence obtained from on-the-spot investigations by Chinese and foreign journalists, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, and the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare" led by Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society. As a medical worker who has long strived for the humanitarian cause of the Red Cross, I feel boundless anger in the face of this shocking crime. Science, which aims to eradicate epidemics and alleviate human suffering, is being used by a handful of murderers on Wall Street to create bacterial weapons that poison and slaughter humanity. This is a great insult to human culture.

    I believe that all righteous Red Cross workers and medical workers around the world, as well as all peace-loving people, will never forgive these scientific criminals, enemies of civilization, and vermin of peace—the inhuman American aggressors who have cut themselves off from humanity. We must take immediate action, unite, and wage a thorough struggle against them.

    Currently, scientists, medical workers, and Red Cross workers in New China are, with their heroic spirit and scientific technology, victoriously encircling and exterminating the poisonous insects and bacteria spread by the American aggressors. Peace-loving people around the world have unanimously expressed their protests and condemnations of this heinous crime committed by the American aggressors. We firmly believe that the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' germ warfare will certainly be extinguished.

    I have also learned that the crimes of the American aggressors not only endanger the people of China and Korea and threaten the security of the people of the world, but also threaten the security of the American people. Therefore, the broad masses of the American people, American scientists with integrity, and Red Cross workers who genuinely want to serve humanitarianism should retain their human conscience and dignity, take immediate action, and adopt effective measures, together with the people of the world, to stop the heinous crimes of the American germ warfare criminals.

    I believe that victory will surely belong to humanity, justice, and peace.

    全世界正直的红十字会工作者，一致起来制止美国侵略者的细菌战
    中国红十字会副会长  胡兰生
    美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北广大地区连续撒布大量带有病菌的昆虫与毒物，进行大规模细菌战的滔天罪行，已被中外记者、国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和中国红十字会会长李德全所领导的
    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”实地调查所得的铁案如山的材料所证实了。我是一个长期为红十字会的人道主义事业而努力的医务工作者。面对这种骇人听闻的罪恶，我感到无限的愤怒。扑灭疫疠，减除人类疾苦的科学，竟为华尔街一小撮的凶手们用来制造毒害人类、屠杀人类的细菌武器，这是给人类文化的莫大侮辱。
    我相信全世界正直的红十字会工作者和医务工作者以及全世界爱好和平的人民，对于这种科学的罪人、文明的死敌、和平的蟊贼，毫无人性、自绝于人类的美国侵略者，一定是不能饶恕的。我们一定要立即行动起来，团结起来，与它作彻底的斗争。
    现在，新中国的科学工作者、医务工作者和红十字会工作者正以他们的英勇精神和科学技术，胜利地在围剿、扑灭美国侵略者撒下的毒虫和细菌。全世界爱好和平人民对于美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行，一致表示抗议和声讨。我们完全相信美国侵略者进行细菌战的毒焰是一定会被扑灭的。
    我也了解到，美国侵略者的罪行，不独危害中朝两国人民，威胁全世界人民的安全，而且同样威胁着美国人民的安全。因此，广大的美国人民、美国正直的科学工作者和真想为人道主义服务的红十字会工作者们，应该保留着人类的良知与尊严，立即行动起来，采取有效措施，与全世界人民一道，制止美国细菌战犯们的滔天罪行。
    我相信，胜利一定属于人道、正义与和平。
