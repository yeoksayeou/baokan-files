Editor's Note: "Central South Peasant" is a comprehensive popular semi-monthly magazine aimed at farmers. This periodical is one of the better-run farmer publications currently available. Since its founding on April 16, 1951, it has reached a circulation of 183,500 copies by late April 1952. The experience of editing such a publication needs to be widely shared. Therefore, we are publishing this article.

"Central South Peasant" was founded on April 16, 1951. From the beginning, it has followed the Party's policy of educating farmers, promoting the Party and the People's Government's various policies, reflecting the situation of the peasant masses in class struggle and production struggle, and to a certain extent meeting the cultural needs of farmers. As a result, it has increasingly become a warmly welcomed publication by farmers and some cadres. In areas with a good distribution base, it has become an indispensable part of farmers' daily lives. In Xiangxiang County, Hunan, the circulation reached 35,000 copies, averaging one copy for every twenty-five people. Now, we will briefly discuss some of the problems we have encountered in editing this publication over the past year.

The Question of Nature and Target Audience

At the beginning of "Central South Peasant," the Central South leading organs pointed out that this publication is a comprehensive political and current affairs publication, an important tool for the Party to educate farmers, and a popular reading material for the peasant masses. However, we did not deeply understand this policy. Therefore, we encountered two fundamental questions at the beginning of our editorial work: The first question is, what ideology and viewpoints should be used to educate farmers? Since "Central South Peasant" is a tool for the Party to educate farmers, it must use the ideology and viewpoints of the working class to educate farmers. This requires promoting the Party and the idea of the worker-peasant alliance in the publication; only in this way can the publication educate farmers, overcome the backward ideas of farmers, and guide farmers forward; only in this way can the publication have guiding significance. However, in actual work, due to the low ideological level of the editorial staff and the lack of a spirit of hard study, there are still many shortcomings in the promotion of the Communist Party and Communism. For example, the promotion of the Party's 30th anniversary in the sixth issue of 1951 only mentioned the historical facts of the land revolution and thereafter, while neglecting the promotion of the workers' movement led by the Party before the land revolution. The column "Advancing Under the Leadership of the Communist Party and the Working Class" in the fifth issue of 1951 only published rural Party member textbooks and paid little attention to rural Party activities; even in the third issue of 1952 (published on February 5), the "February 7th" struggle led by the Party was not mentioned.

The second question is, should we target cadres and produce the publication for cadres to read, or should we target farmers and produce the publication for farmers (including township cadres) to read? We were also not clear about the second question at the beginning. We originally planned to target district and township cadres. However, the leading organs did not agree with this opinion. In this way, our thinking shifted from cadres to farmers. We lowered our stance to get closer to the broad peasant masses and realized that only by targeting the broad peasant masses can we better help cadres educate farmers through the publication, win over a wide range of readers, and make the publication more representative of the masses. Although this is the case, it is still a difficult struggle process to do so. Some comrades' thinking is always not easy to change. They always think that this publication can only talk to cadres, not to the masses; they do not understand that our talking to the masses is also helping cadres talk to the masses, and sometimes talking to cadres is precisely to talk to the masses through cadres.

It is Necessary to Conduct Propaganda Based on Policies and the Actual Situation of Farmers

We followed the Party's policies and, from the first issue of 1951, actively carried out patriotic education and production education for farmers, promoted the idea of Party leadership and the worker-peasant alliance, as well as the central tasks of the countryside in each period; and from the fifth issue of 1951, we relatively fixed the columns "Small Talks," "Policy Q&A," "Love the Country, Protect the Home, Resist America, Aid Korea," "Advancing Under the Leadership of the Communist Party and the Working Class," "Raise Political Vigilance, Consolidate the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and "Farmers Organize Themselves"; At the same time, in the subsequent issues, with the shift of the central tasks in the countryside, the development of actual work, and the changes in the ideological situation of farmers, we added "Struggle for the Complete Elimination of the Feudal System," "Oppose Complacency and Relaxation, Do a Good Job in Rural Work," and recently, in conjunction with the current central task, we opened the column "Respond to Chairman Mao's Call, Strengthen Resistance to America and Aid Korea, Increase Production and Practice Economy, Support the Volunteer Army." Although we felt some restrictions on such sub-sections at certain times, and we still cannot achieve a comprehensive plan, most readers believe that the slogans are clear, the content is concentrated, and it is easy to attract attention. Therefore, we believe that it is entirely necessary to fix the columns according to the Party's basic slogans and the Party's specific slogans for rural work, and gradually enrich their content.

With a clear policy and columns determined according to the content of education, it is still necessary to speak in the editorial work in combination with the actual situation of the countryside and farmers. What is the actual situation of the countryside and farmers? It is the class struggle and production struggle in the countryside and all the thoughts expressed by the farmers in the struggle. The Party and the government's various policies for the countryside and the central tasks promoted in various periods are all put forward from the farmers' own struggle needs and return to the farmers. Therefore, the so-called actual situation of the countryside and farmers is also the problems in the implementation of policies and the problems in various rural movements. Leaving these things, it is only some technical problems.

However, due to the low political and ideological level of the editorial staff, they often can only deal with matters on their own merits when promoting a policy. For example, when promoting cotton planting, they only said that the price of cotton is good and guaranteed no losses (the first issue of 1951); when promoting the organization of supply and marketing cooperatives, they only said that doing business together would avoid exploitation by middlemen, but did not explain how the interests of farmers were combined with the interests of the country, and did not politically explain the benefits of organizing (the second issue of 1951). This has caused great damage to the propaganda work.

Organize Social Forces to Participate in Editorial Work

Over the past year, we have gradually established working relationships with relevant agencies at the Central South level, and have won the participation of about 200 rural activists in our work. These activists include peasant activists, rural Party members, League members, district and township cadres, cadres of the Party committee's propaganda and education departments, agricultural labor models, cooperative workers, people's representatives from old revolutionary base areas, ethnic minority cadres, as well as industrial labor models and combat heroes. We regard them as the backbone of social forces, relying on them to regularly provide information and manuscripts. In addition, there is a non-fixed team of nearly a thousand people who provide us with information and opinions, and they are our main source for discovering new activists and cultivating and supplementing the backbone of correspondents. The next are peasant advisors. Because we are not familiar with the situation in the countryside and do not have a deep understanding of farmers' lives and feelings, we often encounter things that we do not know, and farmers often do not understand what we are saying. Therefore, when we discover any difficult problems, or write a relatively important manuscript, we try our best to take it to the suburbs, read it to the suburban farmers, ask them for their opinions or answers to difficult questions, and get their help. In addition, we are also preparing to invite another cadre who participates in actual rural work, is familiar with the rural situation in Central South, and is politically strong, to participate in our daily editorial work and serve as our special advisor.

Focus on the Main Aspects and Express Them in a Concentrated Form

After all, periodicals are not as closely, comprehensively, and timely integrated with movements as newspapers. Therefore, subjectively, we should not grasp all rural work and the entire process of movements. Instead, we should consider what we should do in the movement and what problems we should help farmers solve, based on the characteristics and weaknesses of the periodicals themselves (compared with newspapers, periodicals have more time to consider the propaganda plan for each issue; but because they are not published daily, it is not easy to keep up with the development of the movement) in order to strive for the initiative in propaganda. For example, at the end of last October, the re-examination work was about to begin in various places. At that time, the main problem in the re-examination was to deeply mobilize farmers with poor awareness and continue to vigorously overcome the complacent thinking of cadres and farmers. The 13th issue of this journal in 1951 focused on introducing the experience of the re-examination pilot projects, emphasizing ideological mobilization, and invited senior leading cadres to write articles to educate farmers: "Work hard and never relax." Comrades and farmers in various places believe that this approach can help them solve problems.

In this regard, our general approach is to first focus on the main aspects, grasp a certain stage of the movement, grasp typical examples, and express them in a concentrated form.

Several examples can be used to illustrate the so-called main aspects. For example, the land reform and re-examination in the winter and spring of last year was the overriding center of rural work in Central South, and of course, it was the main aspect; continuing to deepen the resistance to America and aid Korea, increasing production and practicing economy is the central task of the whole country, and it is also the central task of Central South; in rural areas, the first is to increase yield per unit area and strive for a bumper harvest, which is also the main aspect. The so-called grasping a certain stage of the movement can also be illustrated by examples. For example, in land reform, we roughly determined the propaganda focus of each issue based on the progress of the movement, and made plans according to the work steps of mobilizing, organizing, educating farmers, struggling against the enemy, and implementing policies; minor issues outside the focus were generally omitted. In this way, it seems that the content of each issue is isolated from each other, but if the content of each issue is connected, the entire process of the movement can still be seen. The so-called grasping typical examples is to select typical examples of a certain stage of the movement or a specific work for propaganda. In addition to selecting typical examples from submissions, we can also compile the problems surrounding the same center from submissions and letters together to illustrate a problem from various aspects, or collect and select reports of a similar nature published in local newspapers.

The so-called expressing in a concentrated form means that the central content of each issue should not be too much or too scattered. It is best that the articles in each issue can revolve around a center. Too much content, densely packed, will dilute the main content. At the same time, half a month per issue, the average farmer cannot finish reading it. From the 10th issue of 1951, we gradually paid attention to the method of concentrated expression, first improved the "Small Talks," concentrated on explaining the central idea of each issue, and used a hundred or two hundred words to briefly and concisely explain the current problems; other related columns, as far as possible, are connected to the central content to strengthen the propaganda effect.

The basic reason why we do this is to strive for initiative, combine with the movement, adapt to the level of farmers and the characteristics of the publication itself. However, over the past year, we have not done enough in this regard. The center is not grasped very steadily, and sometimes we inevitably have to attend to one thing and lose sight of another. Even if we can do all the above points, we still cannot completely solve the problem of combining with reality. To be able to combine with reality, it is even more important that our editorial staff be familiar with the Party and government's various policies, grasp the development law of rural work, and understand the ideological situation of farmers in various periods. This requires us to study hard.

The Question of Popularization and Mass Perspective

There is also an important issue in conducting political education for farmers, which is how to make the publication more popular. The basic issue of popularization is the issue of mass perspective: Without the popularization of the mass perspective, no matter how much effort you put into the form, the farmers will still not welcome it. Our editorial staff has worked hard in terms of the form of popularization, but some of the things we write are still not liked by farmers. A farmer poet from Henan came to the editorial department of this journal, and we asked for his opinion on some of our manuscripts. He said: "It's good, but it's not explained clearly." The inability to touch the hearts of farmers and the inability to explain clearly are the result of a weak mass perspective.

The first step in popularization is to understand the farmers' way of thinking, and the second is to learn the farmers' language forms. The most basic things in farmers' way of thinking are "comparison" and "stringing together." The process by which farmers move from facts to principles, from concrete to abstract, from near to far, and from simple to complex is achieved through the methods of "comparison" and "stringing together." Before farmers realized the exploitation of landlords, they only blamed their "horoscope" for being bad. After enlightenment, through recalling, comparing, complaining, and tracing the roots, they realized the crimes of the landlords who directly exploited them and developed inner hatred; but their hatred was only limited to individual landlords who were related to them. If they are then asked to compare the crimes of the landlords who directly exploit them with the crimes of other landlords, they can gradually recognize a group of landlords; after repeated "stringing together" and "comparing," they can recognize the entire landlord class. Therefore, the process of comparing and stringing together, and stringing together and comparing, is the process of farmers' cognitive development. Farmers' "comparison" and "stringing together" are used in a very wide range. Zhang San can be compared to Li Si, today can be compared to yesterday, and cattle pulling plows can be compared to tractors. A peasant representative from Hengshan County, Hunan, wrote a letter after visiting the local specialty exhibition and the waterworks in Wuhan, saying: "After visiting the factory, I opened my eyes and realized the greatness of the workers. There are 800,000 people in Hankou. If people were to carry the water used in a day, how many people would it take! When the machine at the waterworks is turned on, water is delivered to every household." In terms of understanding the enemy, after comparison and stringing together, farmers will string together from the local tyrants in their hometown all the way to Truman. If we want to explain a truth to farmers, we must grasp this basic way of thinking of farmers. Secondly, the characteristics of farmers' language form are simplicity and imagery. For example, we told farmers how to mobilize farmers with poor awareness in the re-examination, and said a lot of things, but it was nothing more than telling everyone how to identify the target, use different methods according to different requirements, and mobilize them one by one. But in the farmers' own words, it is very simple: "One key opens one lock!" On the contrary, it is much clearer than what we said. However, it is not easy to understand farmers' way of thinking and learn farmers' language form. Therefore, in addition to strengthening ideological training, we should also let the editorial staff go to the countryside as much as possible, go deep into the countryside, and understand the thoughts and feelings of farmers; only by shortening the distance in thoughts and feelings with farmers, and then integrating, refining, and sublimating farmers' way of thinking and language form can we achieve true popularization.

    “中南农民”一年来的编辑工作
    彭展
    编者按：“中南农民”是以农民为对象的综合性的通俗半月刊。这个期刊是目前农民刊物中办得较好的一个。自一九五一年四月十六日创刊，至一九五二年四月下旬，已发行到十八万三千五百份。编辑这种期刊的经验，是需要广为交流的。因此，我们特发表这篇文章。
    “中南农民”于一九五一年四月十六日创刊。它一开始就遵循着党的教育农民的方针，宣传了党和人民政府的各项政策，反映了农民群众在阶级斗争和生产斗争中的情况，并在一定程度上满足了农民文化上的要求，因而日益成为农民及一部分干部所热烈欢迎的刊物。在发行基础较好的地区，它已经成为农民日常生活中不可缺少的东西了。湖南湘乡县曾发行到三万五千本，平均二十五人就有一本。现在把我们一年来在编辑这个刊物中所碰到的一些问题，扼要地来谈一谈。
    性质和对象的问题
    “中南农民”创刊之初，中南领导机关就曾指出，这个刊物是一个综合性的政治、时事刊物，是党教育农民的重要工具之一，是一个通俗的农民群众的读物。但我们对这一方针尚未深刻体会，因此开始进行编辑工作时就接触到两个带根本性质的问题：第一个问题，是用什么思想、观点、来教育农民？“中南农民”既然是党教育农民的工具，那末，就必须用工人阶级的思想、观点来教育农民。这就必须在刊物中宣传党，宣传工农联盟的思想；只有这样，才能通过刊物来教育农民，克服农民的落后思想，引导农民前进；也只有这样，才能使刊物具有指导性。但在实际工作中，由于编辑人员的思想水平不高和坚苦学习的精神不够，在宣传共产党和共产主义方面，仍存在着很多缺点。例如，一九五一年第六本关于党的三十周年的宣传，仅提到土地革命及以后的史实，而忽略了宣传在土地革命以前党所领导的工人运动。一九五一年第五本起“在共产党和工人阶级领导下前进”一栏，只刊登了农村党员课本，很少注意到农村党的活动；甚至在一九五二年第三本（二月五日出版）中，对于党所领导的“二七”斗争也没有加以讲述。
    第二个问题，是以干部为对象、办给干部看呢，还是以农民为对象、办给农民（包括乡干部）看呢？对于第二个问题，我们在开始时也是认识得不明确的。我们原来打算，把对象放在区乡干部方面。但领导机关不同意这个意见。这样，我们在思想上就从干部转移到农民方面来，就放下架子来和广大农民群众接近；并从而体会到：只有以广大农民为对象，才能更好地通过刊物帮助干部向农民进行教育，才能争取广大的读者，使刊物更能体现它的群众性。虽然这样，做起来仍然是一个艰苦的斗争过程。有些同志的思想总是不容易扭转。他们总认为这刊物只能对干部讲话，而不能向群众讲话；不了解我们向群众讲话，也是帮助干部向群众讲话，有时候向干部讲话，也正是为了通过干部向群众讲话。
    必须根据政策和农民的实际情况进行宣传
    我们遵循党的方针，从一九五一年第一本起就积极向农民进行爱国主义教育和生产教育，宣传党的领导和工农联盟的思想以及每一时期的农村中心工作；并在一九五一年第五本开始把“小讲话”、“政策问答”、“爱国保家抗美援朝”、“在共产党和工人阶级领导下前进”、“提高政治警惕，巩固人民民主专政”、“农民们组织起来”等栏，相对地固定下来；同时在以后的各本中，随着农村中心任务的推移和实际工作的发展以及农民思想情况的变化等，又增加了“为彻底消灭封建制度而斗争”、“反对自满松劲思想，作好农村工作”，以及最近为结合当前中心任务而辟的“响应毛主席号召，加强抗美援朝，增产节约，支持志愿军”等栏。对于这样的分栏，虽然我们在某些时候感到有些限制，而且也还不能做到有通盘的计划；但一般读者都认为口号鲜明，内容集中，容易引起注意。因此，我们认为根据党的基本口号和党对农村工作的具体口号来固定栏目，并逐步充实其内容，是完全必要的。
    有了明确的方针，有了按照教育内容确定的栏目，在编辑工作中还须结合农村和农民的实际情况来说话。什么是农村和农民的实际情况呢？就是农村的阶级斗争和生产斗争以及农民在斗争中所表现的全部思想。党和政府对农村的各项政策以及各个时期所推行的中心工作，都是从农民本身的斗争需要提出来，又回到农民中去的，因此所谓农村和农民的实际情况，也就是执行政策中的问题和农村各种运动中的问题，离开这些东西，那就只是一些技术性的问题。
    但由于编辑人员的政治、思想水平不高，因此，在宣传一项政策时，往往只能做到就事论事。例如，宣传种棉花，只说棉花的价钱好，保证不吃亏（一九五一年第一本）；宣传组织供销合作社，只说合伙做生意，免得受中间商人的剥削，而没有说明农民的利益如何和国家利益相结合，没有从政治上说明组织起来的好处（一九五一年第二本）。这就使宣传工作受到很大的损失。
    组织社会力量参加编辑工作
    一年以来，我们和中南级的有关机关，逐渐建立了工作上的联系，并争取到二百来个农村积极分子参加了我们的工作。这些积极分子包括农民积极分子、农村党员、团员、区乡干部、党委宣教部门的干部、农业劳动模范、合作社工作者、老根据地人民代表、少数民族干部，以及工业劳动模范和战斗英雄。我们把他们当成社会力量的基干，依靠他们经常供给情况和稿件。此外，还有近千人的一个不固定的队伍，给我们反映情况和意见，他们是我们从中发现新的积极分子、培养补充基干通讯员的主要来源。再次就是农民顾问。因为我们对农村的情况不熟悉，对农民的生活、感情体会不深，经常会碰到一些我们所不知道的事情，我们说的话农民也常听不懂。所以我们发现了什么疑难问题，或写就一篇比较重要的稿子，就尽可能拿到郊区去，读给郊区农民听，请他们提意见或解答疑难，取得他们的帮助。此外我们还准备另请一位参加农村实际工作、熟悉中南农村情况、政治上较强的干部，参加我们的日常编辑工作，做我们的专门顾问。
    从主要方面着眼，用集中的形式表现
    期刊毕竟不像报纸一样和运动结合得那样全面、紧密、及时，因此在主观上就不应把所有的农村工作和运动的全部过程都抓起来，而应根据期刊本身的特点和弱点（和报纸比较，期刊有更多的时间来考虑每期的宣传计划；但由于不是每日出版，不易赶上运动的发展），考虑我们在运动中究竟应该做那些事情，帮助农民解决那些问题，以争取宣传上的主动。如去年十月底，各地复查工作就要展开，当时复查中的主要问题是深入地发动觉悟差的农民，继续大力克服干部和农民的松气思想。本刊一九五一年第十三本就集中介绍了复查试点经验，强调思想发动工作，并约请上级领导干部撰文教育农民：“努力向前，松不得气。”各地工作同志和农民认为这样的做法，能够帮助他们解决问题。
    在这一方面，我们一般的做法，是先从主要方面着眼，抓住一定的运动阶段，抓典型，用集中的形式来表现。
    所谓主要方面，可以举几个例子来说明。例如去冬今春的土地改革和复查，是中南农村工作中的压倒一切的中心，当然是主要方面；继续深入抗美援朝，增产节约是全国的中心任务，也是中南的中心任务；在农村中首先是提高单位面积产量，争取丰收，这也是主要方面。所谓抓取运动的一定阶段，也可以举例子来说明。比方土地改革，我们就大体上按照发动、组织、教育农民、斗争敌人、执行政策等工作步骤，根据运动的进程，一般地确定每期的宣传重点，做出计划；重点以外的次要问题，一般略而不谈。这样，看来好像每期的内容各自孤立，但把各期的内容联系起来看，仍然可以看出运动的整个过程。所谓抓典型，就是选择运动某一阶段或某一具体工作的典型事例来宣传。典型的事例除从来稿中选择外，还可以把来稿、来信中围绕同一中心的问题，编在一起，从各个方面来说明一个问题，或者把地方报纸刊载的同类性质的报道收集起来，加以选择。
    所谓用集中的形式来表现，就是：每期的中心内容不要太多或过于分散，最好每期的文章都能围绕着一个中心。内容过多，密密杂杂，就会冲淡了主要内容。同时半个月一期，一般农民也读不完。我们从一九五一年第十本起，逐渐注意到集中表现的方式，先改进了“小讲话”，集中说明每期的中心思想，用百把两百字简明扼要地讲明当前的问题；其他有关各栏，凡是能够和中心内容联系起来的，尽可能地联系起来，以加强宣传效果。
    我们之所以这样做，基本上都是为了争取主动，结合运动，适应农民的水平和刊物本身的特点。但一年以来我们在这一方面做得还是很不够的，中心还不是抓得很稳，有时候还不免要顾此失彼。就是能够把以上各点通通做到，也还不能全部解决结合实际的问题。要能做到结合实际，更其重要的还是必须使我们的编辑人员熟悉党和政府的各项政策，掌握农村工作的发展规律和各个时期农民的思想情况，这就更须要我们艰苦地学习。
    通俗化和群众观点的问题
    向农民作政治教育，还有一个重要的问题，就是如何使刊物更加通俗化。通俗化的基本问题，是群众观点的问题：没有群众观点的通俗化，任你怎样从形式上用工夫，农民还是不欢迎的。我们的编辑人员在通俗化的形式方面，算是努力的，但我们编写的东西有些仍不为农民所喜爱。河南有个农民诗人到本刊编辑部来，我们征求他对我们某些文稿的意见。他说：“好是好，就是没说明白。”不能打动农民心灵和说不明白，乃是群众观点不强的结果。
    通俗化的做法，第一要体会农民的思想方法，第二要学习农民的语言形式。农民的思想方法，最基本的东西，就是“比”和“串”。农民由事实到原则，由具体到抽象，由近到远，由简单到复杂的认识过程，都是采用了“比”和“串”的方法实现的。农民在没有认识到地主的剥削以前，只怪自己“八字”不好，经过启发，通过回忆、对比、诉苦、追根，认识了直接剥削他的地主的罪恶，滋长了内心仇恨；但他的仇恨还只是限于个别和他有关的地主身上。如果再让他把直接剥削他的地主的罪恶和其他地主的罪恶对比，就可以逐渐认识一群地主；再经反复“串”、“比”，就可以认识整个地主阶级。所以一比一串、一串一比的过程，就是农民认识发展的过程。农民的“比”和“串”，运用范围非常广泛，张三可以比李四，今天可以比昨天，牛拉犁可以比拖拉机。湖南衡山县一个农民代表到武汉参观了土特产展览和自来水厂后，来信说：“参观工厂后，打开了眼界，认识了工人老大哥的伟大。汉口有八十万人，一天用的水，要是人挑，得多少人呀！自来水厂的机器一开，家家户户的水就送上门了。”在对敌人的认识上，经过一比一串，农民就会从他们乡里的恶霸地主一直串到杜鲁门。我们要向农民讲清一个道理，就必须掌握农民这一基本的思想方法。其次，农民语言形式的特点就是朴素和形象化。例如我们对农民讲在复查中怎样发动觉悟很差的农民，讲了许多话，无非是要告诉大家怎样看准对象，根据不同的要求，用不同的方法，一个一个地发动。但照农民自己的说法，就很简单：“一把钥匙开一把锁！”反而比我们讲得清楚得多。但要体会农民的思想方法，学习农民的语言形式，并不是一件容易的事。因此，我们除了加强思想锻炼之外，还应尽可能让编辑人员多多下乡，深入农村，体会农民的思想感情；只有缩短了和农民思想感情上的距离，再把农民的思想方法、语言形式融会贯通，予以提炼，才能做到真正的通俗化。
