Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 2nd: To thoroughly expose how the American side reneged, went back on its word, and deliberately delayed the armistice negotiations in the administrative meeting of the staff officers for the fourth agenda item, this reporter visited the responsible personnel of the Korean-Chinese negotiation delegation and learned the following about the development process of the administrative meeting of the staff officers for the fourth agenda item:

	On March 5th, in order to break the long-standing deadlock in the POW issue negotiations, our side proposed that both sides, based on the materials already exchanged regarding the POWs held by both sides, should first determine the principle of releasing and repatriating all POWs after the armistice. On March 21st, our side further proposed a clause on the principle of repatriation: "After the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will release and repatriate all 11,559 POWs they hold, and the United Nations Command will release and repatriate all 132,474 POWs they hold. The above POW lists will be finalized by the staff officers of both sides." On March 22nd, our side further stated that there might be special circumstances regarding personnel captured by both sides who originated from the detaining side, which could be considered for adjustment within the scope of our side's principle clause of March 21st. Our side's repatriation principle of March 21st laid the foundation for entering the administrative meeting. On March 25th, both sides agreed to enter the administrative meeting. On March 27th, our side further proposed a compromise adjustment to allow all POWs to return home, namely: both sides unconditionally repatriate all POWs of Korean nationality from the other side and captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army or captured personnel of the United Nations Command. Korean POWs who originated from the detaining side and wish to return home immediately after the armistice may not be repatriated.

	The American side had to acknowledge our side's continuous efforts to solve the problem in the meeting. On March 23rd, US Army Colonel Hickman, chief staff officer of the American side in the staff officers meeting for the fourth agenda item, stated: "Our team is very clear about the steps you have recently taken to resolve the issues between the two sides." On March 25th, Colonel Hickman said again: "Our side has carefully considered the discussions of the past few days, especially your proposal of March 21st and your further explanation of this proposal on March 22nd. These have encouraged the hope that a solution acceptable to both sides is not beyond the realm of possibility." Colonel Hickman also repeatedly stated: "It is possible to resolve this agenda item within the general outline of your side's principle of March 21st."

	On March 26th, Colonel Hickman further explained: "You used a definite number in your principle clause of March 21st, and we feel that this is part of your principle—we should reach a final integer that serves as the basis for releasing and repatriating agreed upon by both sides."

	On April 1st, Colonel Hickman more clearly stated: "We believe that the number of 132,000 does not take all relevant factors into account, and therefore seems to be too high. We have pointed out that a number of 116,000 may more closely represent the magnitude of the exchange."

	Although our side could not agree with the number of 116,000 proposed by the American side, in order to promote the progress of the meeting, our side proposed that both sides first determine the approximate number of repatriated POWs. On April 19th, the American side proposed an intolerable figure of 70,000 repatriated POWs, fundamentally overturning the basis of the administrative meeting of the staff officers for the fourth agenda item. Therefore, our side announced on April 25th the cancellation of the administrative meeting and the entry into open negotiations.

	On April 28th, the American side requested at the delegation conference that the conference enter the administrative meeting to resolve the remaining issues of each agenda item together. Based on our side's consistent position of wishing to quickly and reasonably resolve issues in all meetings, we agreed to this suggestion from the American side. However, as our representative pointed out, the solution to the problem does not lie in the change of meeting format, but in the sincerity of solving the problem. If the American side continues to adopt the attitude of reneging and going back on its word that it adopted in the staff officers meeting at the delegation conference, the armistice negotiations will be impossible to advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 2nd: Relevant personnel of our delegation to the Korean armistice negotiations familiar with the fourth agenda item have just commented on the absurdity of the number of repatriated POWs from our side proposed by the American side:

	The recent negotiations on the fourth agenda item have once again fully exposed the American side's usual tactics of deception and extortion in the negotiations and their duplicitous attitude. Since the fourth agenda item began to be discussed, the American side has constantly claimed that it is willing to negotiate on an equal footing in order to obtain a compromise solution to the problem. But the fact is that although our side, with the sincerity of reaching an agreement as soon as possible, has made continuous major efforts that even the American representatives cannot deny, the American side still stubbornly adheres to the so-called "voluntary repatriation" of all POWs that was initially proposed, attempting to detain 100,000 POWs from our side.

	In order to break the deadlock of the administrative meeting, our side proposed on April 4th that both sides immediately enter the work of correcting the lists, that is, to revise the lists exchanged by both sides on December 18, 1951, based on our side's compromise adjustment principle of March 27th, as well as the increase and individual deaths and escapes of POWs in these four months. However, the American side fundamentally overturned the legal basis of the exchanged lists, completely disregarded our side's reasonable suggestion of March 27th, and proposed the absurd number of repatriating 70,000 POWs from our side on April 19th. Moreover, they shamelessly claimed that their illegal so-called "screening" was agreed to by our side in advance. In fact, our side has never admitted that the "screening" of POWs from our side is legal, and has never agreed to the other side's so-called "screening." The entire record of the administrative meeting of the fourth agenda item can prove this. The number of 70,000 proposed by the other side is absolutely absurd, and is clearly in violation of the principle of unconditional repatriation of POWs under the Geneva Convention. If the American side wishes to solve the problem, it must first abandon this rascal-like style.

    我方谈判代表团负责人员
    揭露美方出尔反尔的无赖态度
    美方如仍继续其欺骗讹诈态度，谈判将不可能有任何进展
    【新华社开城二日电】为了彻底揭露美方在第四项议程参谋会议行政性会议中如何出尔反尔，自食其言，蓄意拖延停战谈判的行为，记者特访问朝中谈判代表团负责人员，对于第四项议程参谋会议行政性会议的发展过程，获悉如下：
    三月五日，我方为打开战俘问题谈判中的长期僵局，提议双方以已经交换的关于双方收容的战俘材料为基础，首先确定双方在停战后释放与遣返全部战俘的原则。三月二十一日，我方更提出遣俘原则条文：“在停战协定签字并生效后，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面释放并遣返其所收容的一万一千五百五十九名全部战俘，联合国军方面释放并遣返其所收容的十三万二千四百七十四名全部战俘。上述战俘名单由双方参谋人员予以最后校正。”三月二十二日，我方又进一步表示双方被俘人员中原籍在收容者一方者可能存在着某种特殊情况，可以考虑在我方三月二十一日的原则条文范围内加以调整。我方三月二十一日的遣俘原则奠定了进入行政性会议的基础。三月二十五日双方同意进入行政性会议。三月二十七日我方更提出了让一切战俘得以回家的折衷的调整，即：双方相互无条件全部遣返其所收容的原籍对方的朝鲜籍战俘以及中国人民志愿军被俘人员或联合国军被俘人员。原籍在收容一方的朝鲜籍战俘，愿在停战后立即回家者，可以不予遣返。
    我方这种连续的为解决问题而作的努力，美方在会议上也不得不予以承认。三月二十三日，第四项议程参谋会议美方首席参谋希克曼上校声称：“我方小组很明了你们最近为解决双方间问题的步骤。”三月二十五日，希克曼上校又称；“我方对于过去几天来的讨论，特别是对于你方三月二十一日的提案和你方三月二十二日对这一提案的进一步解释，作了仔细考虑。这些已鼓舞了希望，即为双方所能接受的解决方案并非在可能范围以外的。”希克曼上校也一再声称：“在你方三月二十一日原则的总的轮廓内解决这一项议程是可能的。”
    三月二十六日，希克曼上校又补充解释称：“你们在你方三月二十一日原则条文中用了一个确定的数字，我们觉得这是你方原则的一部分——我们应当达到作为双方协议了的释放与遣返的基础的一个最后的整数。”
    四月一日，希克曼上校更明确声称：“我们认为十三万二千的数字是没有把一切有关因素都考虑在内的，因此似乎是一个太高了的数字。我们指出过：可能十一万六千的数字能更近似地表示出交换数量的大小。”
    虽然我方不能同意美方所提出的十一万六千的数字，但为了促进会议的进展，我方提议双方首先确定遣俘概数。美方在四月十九日提出了令人不能容忍的七万遣俘数字，根本推翻了第四项议程参谋会议行政性会议的基础。因此我方于四月二十五日宣布取消行政性会议，进入公开谈判。
    四月二十八日，美方在代表团大会上要求大会进入行政性会议，将各项议程的剩余问题一并予以解决。我方本着愿在一切会议上迅速合理解决问题的一贯立场，同意了美方的这一建议。但正如我方代表所指出的，问题的解决不在于会议形式的变化，而在于解决问题的诚意。如果美方在代表团大会上，仍然继续其在参谋会议中所采取的出尔反尔自食其言的态度，停战谈判将不可能有任何进展。
    【新华社开城二日电】朝鲜停战谈判的我方代表团中熟悉第四项议程的有关人员，顷就美方提出的遣返我方被俘人员概数的荒谬性发表评论称：
    最近第四项议程的谈判，又一次充分暴露了美方在谈判中所惯用的欺骗讹诈的伎俩与口是心非的态度。自从第四项议程开始讨论以来，美方不断地声称愿意在双方平等的基础上进行协商，以获得解决问题的折衷办法。但事实是：虽然我方本着早日达成协议的诚意，连续作了连美方代表也不能不承认的重大努力，美方却至今仍死硬地坚持最初提出的对全部战俘实行所谓“自愿遣返”，企图扣留我方十万被俘人员。
    我方为了打开行政性会议的僵局，在四月四日提出了双方立即进入名单的校正工作，也就是根据我方三月二十七日的折衷调整原则以及这四个月战俘的增加与个别死亡、逃亡的事实，对一九五一年十二月十八日双方所交换的名单加以修正。但美方却根本推翻了已交换的名单的法定基础，全然不顾我方三月二十七日的合理建议，在四月十九日提出了荒谬绝伦的遣返七万名我方被俘人员的概数。并且他们更无赖地声称他们进行非法的所谓“甄别”是事先得到我方同意的。其实我方从未承认过对我方被俘人员的“甄别”是合法的，更没有同意过对方的所谓“甄别”，整个第四项议程行政性会议的记录，可作证明。对方提出的七万概数是绝对荒谬的，而且显然是违反日内瓦公约无条件遣返战俘的原则。美方如愿解决问题，首先就必须放弃这种无赖的作风。
