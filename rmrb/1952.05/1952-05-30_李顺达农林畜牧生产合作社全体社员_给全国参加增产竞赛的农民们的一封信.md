To the agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, model laborers, and farmer brothers and sisters throughout the country who have accepted our challenge:

Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" inspires us. Since the beginning of spring, all members of our agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative have been engaged in the intense spring plowing production movement with a fighting spirit. We have received your challenge letters one after another, which has further encouraged our courage and confidence. We have created considerable achievements in the first production campaign of 1952. By May 15, the spring planting work on all 159.5 mu of land in the cooperative had been victoriously completed.

After entering the spring planting movement, in order to maintain a high degree of production enthusiasm, we continued to study and discuss current affairs. When we learned that the evil American imperialists were using bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese and Korean people, our hearts were filled with hatred. We turned hatred into a fighting force. At the end of March, we listened to the reports of the delegation of returning Chinese People's Volunteers and the delegation of the Korean People's visit to China, and received a more profound education. The volunteer representatives said that the volunteers have a slogan: "Hardship is glory, overcoming difficulties is victory." This sentence encouraged our fighting courage and made us a hundred times more confident and determined to achieve victory on the production front. We thought: it would be an honor for Xigou Village, with its thick stones and thin soil, to make greater achievements in the patriotic and bumper harvest movement; we will be able to overcome the difficulties of lacking all five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and we will definitely be able to achieve victory. We firmly grasped the central task of preventing drought and fighting drought, and carried out all the agricultural activities in preparation for spring planting.

On May 1st, we happily commemorated this great festival of unity and struggle for the people of the world. This festival further increased our labor enthusiasm. We completed spring plowing and sowing in one breath, overfulfilling the original plan. This spring, in terms of drought prevention and resistance, in addition to accumulating snow to preserve soil moisture on 63 mu of land, we built 10 water storage ponds, repaired 2 dry water canals, opened 1 spring water canal, and dug 10 cattle lying pits, all of which exceeded the original plan. This played a decisive role in ensuring timely sowing and created favorable conditions for long-term production work. In terms of fertilization, the original plan for autumn fields was to apply 110 dan of base fertilizer per mu; later, due to close cooperation with the supply and marketing cooperative, according to the combination contract, we bought back 2,000 jin of sesame cake, 165 jin of mustard seed, and 100 jin of fertilizer powder, plus various fertilizers accumulated from livestock pens, sheep trampling manure, and sanitary cleanups, each mu was applied with 116 dan of base fertilizer, exceeding the original plan by 6 dan. The ten mu of high-yield land were applied with 180 dan of base fertilizer per mu, exceeding the original plan by 50 dan. About 10 mu of the 34 mu of wheat fields were applied with top dressing, averaging 20 dan per mu. In terms of cultivation, we paid special attention to the combination of increasing the number of times and improving the quality. All 125 mu of autumn land in the cooperative were plowed, harrowed, and raked three times each, and new-style walking plows were used on 70% of the land. The wheat fields have been hoeed once. Due to the rational use of land and labor, five land boundaries were broken, expanding the cultivated area; and the soil of 20 mu of land was improved, and 202 collapsed "earth embankments" were rebuilt, totaling 190 zhang in length. In terms of sowing, all major autumn crops used improved varieties, and the seeds were carefully selected; before sowing, new-style seed treaters were used for warm soup soaking and chemical seed dressing. Millet was all sown in wide ridges; some Golden Queen corn adopted the method of nest fertilization and spot sowing, with 1,600 plants per mu (according to the fact that Golden Queen corn requires a lot of fertilizer and water, generally about 900 plants are planted per mu). In terms of afforestation, the original plan was to afforest 100 mu and plant 1,500 trees throughout the year; as a result, 200 mu were afforested and 2,752 trees were planted in one season. In addition, 62 trees were grafted, increasing the orchard by 1.8 mu; and 10 mu of bad land that did not grow crops were planted with fruit trees, and half a mu of saplings were cultivated. The annual plan was overfulfilled in one season. In terms of animal husbandry, the original plan was to buy one breeding animal before spring and increase the number of pigs by five; as a result, one breeding animal (donkey) and one cow were bought, and the number of pigs was increased by ten, and 32 lambs were also bred. To solve the feed problem, alfalfa was planted on 10 mu of hillside land. In terms of sideline occupations, there were also many achievements. Because labor was used rationally in collective labor, saving manpower; in order to find a way out for the surplus labor force, in addition to processing the land, five laborers were drawn out to engage in sideline production, earning back 1,300 jin of millet.

On May 16, the day after the end of spring planting, all members of our cooperative held a meeting to summarize and evaluate the work in this stage, and selected 16 male and female patriotic production models. In the summary, we further experienced that agricultural production cooperatives are stronger than mutual aid groups. Five non-member households repeatedly requested to join the cooperative, and after democratic discussion, we decided to admit them.

In early May, the PingShun County People's Government held an award ceremony in our village and gave us the medals, certificates, and bonuses awarded by the Central Ministry of Agriculture. All members had unspeakable joy and excitement. After discussion, we decided to use all five million yuan of bonuses to expand reproduction. On the basis of the successful completion of spring plowing and spring sowing, we discussed and formulated a summer production plan:

1. Weeding and protecting seedlings is our central task in summer. All autumn fields must be weeded three times; all corn fields must be top-dressed, 30 dan per mu; ten mu of high-yield land must be top-dressed with 260 dan per mu; every time it rains, it must be weeded and fertilized once.

2. Use the bonus to buy 50 sheep, develop the flock, and increase fertilizer and sideline income.

3. Accumulate more than 5,000 dan of fertilizer to ensure that there is sufficient fertilizer for top dressing in autumn fields and autumn sowing in wheat fields.

4. Draw six laborers to engage in sideline production and earn 3,000 jin of rice.

5. Prepare enough fuel to be used after the autumn harvest.

6. Press 200 mulberry branches to prepare for silkworm rearing.

7. Organize evaluations before the wheat harvest and conduct field selection of seeds; regularly check for pests and kill them as soon as they are discovered.

8. Carry out the patriotic anti-epidemic and health campaign.

Our achievements in spring production are only the beginning of our victory on the agricultural production front this year. All members of our cooperative are determined to follow the plan and make greater achievements in summer production with redoubled efforts. We must follow the action slogan of "ensure planting, ensure emergence (seedling emergence), ensure top-dressing (top-dressing), ensure weeding, ensure seedlings, and ensure harvest," and do our best to ensure the realization of the annual bumper harvest plan, increase the yield per unit area, create a new record of collective bumper harvest, support the struggle against the United States and aid Korea, support industrial production, consolidate national defense, and build the motherland. How are your evaluations and summaries going? We hope you will write letters to the newspaper to report the evaluation and summary situation, so that everyone can exchange experiences.

    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社全体社员
    给全国参加增产竞赛的农民们的一封信全国各地向我们应战的农业生产合作社、互助组、劳动模范和农民兄弟姐妹们：
    毛主席关于“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召鼓舞着我们。入春以来，我们这个农林畜牧生产合作社的全体社员，以战斗的姿态，投入了紧张的春耕生产运动。我们接二连三地收到了你们的应战信，这更鼓励了我们的勇气和信心。我们在一九五二年第一个生产战役中，创造了不小的战绩。到五月十五日，全社一百五十九亩五分土地上的春播工作都已胜利完成。
    我们进入春播运动以后，为了经常保持高度的生产热情，仍然不断地学习和讨论时事。当我们知道了万恶的美帝国主义使用细菌武器虐杀朝中人民的时候，心里充满了愤恨。我们把愤恨变成了战斗的力量。三月末，我们听了中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团的报告，受到了更为深刻的教育。志愿军代表说，志愿军有句口号：“艰苦就是光荣，克服困难就是胜利。”这句话鼓舞了我们的斗争勇气，使我们百倍地增强了取得生产战线上的胜利的信心和决心。我们想着：石厚土薄的西沟村能在爱国丰产运动中作出更大的成绩，就是光荣；我们能克服金、木、水、火、土五行全缺的困难，就一定能取得胜利。我们紧紧地抓住了防旱抗旱的中心工作，进行了准备春播的一切农事活动。
    “五一”那一天，我们愉快地纪念了这个全世界人民团结斗争的伟大节日。这个节日更提高了我们的劳动热情。我们一口气完成了春耕播种，超额完成了原订的计划。今年春季，我们在防旱抗旱方面，除了积雪保墒六十三亩地以外，打了十个蓄水池，修了两道旱水渠，开了一道泉水渠，挖了十个卧牛坑，这些都超过了原订计划。这对于保证适时下种起了决定的作用，而且为长期的生产工作造成了有利的条件。在施肥方面，秋田原计划每亩上底肥一百一十担；后来由于和供销合作社密切结合，按照结合合同，买回麻饼两千斤，芥菜子一百六十五斤，肥田粉一百斤，加上牲口圈、羊踩粪和卫生大扫除等所积的各种肥料，每亩上了底肥一百一十六担，超过原计划六担。十亩丰产地每亩上底肥一百八十担，超过原计划五十担。三十四亩麦田，有十亩左右上了追肥，平均每亩上了二十担。在耕作方面，我们特别注意了次数增多和质量提高相结合。全社一百二十五亩秋地都做到了耕耙耢各三遍，在百分之七十的土地上使用了新式步犁。麦田已普遍锄过一次。由于合理地使用土地和劳动力，打破地界五道，扩大了耕地面积；并改良了二十亩地的土壤，重新垒起塌了的“地堰”二百零二道，计长一百九十丈。在播种方面，大秋作物全部用了优良品种，种籽粒粒经过精选；播种前用新式拌种器进行了温汤浸种和药剂拌种。谷子都播成了宽垅；部分金皇后玉米采用了窝肥点种的办法，每亩密植一千六百株（按金皇后种玉米需肥需水量很大，一般每亩植株在九百株左右。）在造林方面，原计划全年合作造林一百亩，植树一千五百棵；结果一季就造林二百亩，植树二千七百五十二棵。此外，接木六十二棵，增加果园一亩八分；并把不长庄稼的十亩坏地种上了果木树，还培育了半亩树苗。一季就超额完成了全年的计划。在畜牧方面，原计划春前买种畜一头，增加猪五口；结果买了种畜（驴）一头、母牛一头，增加猪十口，还繁殖了三十二只小羊。为了解决饲料问题，在十亩山坡地上种了苜蓿。在副业方面，也有不少成绩。因为在集体劳动中合理地使用劳动力，节省了人工；为了给剩余劳动力找出路，除了对土地进行加工之外，抽出五个劳动力进行副业生产，赚回小米一千三百斤。
    五月十六日，春播结束后的第二天，我们全体社员开了一个会，对这一阶段的工作进行了总结和评比，选出男女爱国生产模范十六人。在总结中，我们进一步体验到了农业生产合作社比互助组更强。有五户非社员再三要求入社，我们经过民主讨论，决定吸收他们入社。
    五月上旬，平顺县人民政府在我村召开了授奖大会，把中央农业部颁发的奖章、奖状和奖金给了我们。全体社员有说不尽的欢乐和兴奋。我们讨论之后，决定把五百万元奖金全部用到扩大再生产上面。在春耕春播胜利完成的基础上，我们又经过讨论，订出了夏季的生产计划：
    一、锄苗保苗是我们夏季的中心任务。全部秋田要普锄三遍；全部玉茭地都上追肥，每亩三十担；十亩丰产地每亩要上追肥二百六十担；每下一场雨要锄一遍，施一次肥。
    二、用奖金买羊五十只，发展羊群，增加肥料和副业收入。
    三、积肥五千多担，保证秋田上追肥和麦田秋播所需肥料充足。
    四、抽六个劳动力进行副业生产，赚米三千斤。
    五、要准备出可用到秋收后的足够的燃料。
    六、压桑条二百棵，为养蚕作准备。
    七、麦收前组织评比，进行田间选种；经常检查有无虫害，一发现就随时扑灭。
    八、开展爱国防疫卫生运动。
    我们在春季生产中的成绩，还仅仅是今年我们在农业生产战线上的胜利的开端。我们全体社员决心按照计划，在夏季生产中，再接再厉，创造更大的成绩。我们要按照“保种、保出（出苗）、保追（追肥）、保锄、保苗、保收”的行动口号，尽全力保证全年丰产计划的实现，提高单位面积产量，创造集体的丰产新纪录，支援抗美援朝的斗争，支援工业生产，巩固国防，建设祖国。你们的评比、总结搞得怎样？希望你们把评比总结的情形写信寄给报社，大家交流经验。
