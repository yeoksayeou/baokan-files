    Suggestion to Promote the 1951 Weaving Method at Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 8

    Editor: I am the Chief Engineer of the Qingdao East China Textile Management Bureau and one of the founders of the 1951 Weaving Method. The 1951 Weaving Method is the result of long-term research and the collective wisdom of many people, and it makes a significant contribution to the textile industry. However, the administrative leaders of Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 8 have refused to promote the 1951 Weaving Method and still want to work according to the old methods of the past. As a result, their output has decreased, and the number of substandard cloths has increased. It pains me greatly to see them make such a mess of promoting advanced experience.

    To do a good job, a textile factory must implement more than ten new working methods. These new working methods are precisely what we are summarizing or promoting, such as methods for cotton cleaning, carding, winding, and warping. It is clearly wrong for some factories, like Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 8, to refuse to promote these advanced working methods. I feel this is a very serious problem, and if it is not corrected in time, not only will the 1951 Weaving Method fail to be implemented, but also many other new working methods will be impossible to promote and consolidate. Relevant leading cadres should consider this carefully and correct it quickly.

### 建议青岛国棉八厂推广一九五一织布工作法

    建议青岛国棉八厂推广一九五一织布工作法
    编辑同志：我是青岛华东纺织管理分局的总工程师，也是一九五一织布工作法创始人之一。一九五一织布工作法是经过长时期研究，集中多数人的智慧创造出来的，它对纺织工业的贡献是很大的。但是，青岛国棉八厂行政领导干部竟拒绝推广一九五一织布工作法，仍想按照过去的旧办法工作。他们这样做的结果，使产量降低了，次布增加了。我眼看他们把推广先进经验的工作搞得一团糟，真是痛心万分。
    一个纺织工厂要把工作做好，必须推行十多种新工作法。这些新工作法也正是我们正在总结或正在推广的，如清棉、梳棉、络经、整经等方法。有的工厂像青岛国棉八厂一样，拒绝推广这些先进工作法，显然是错误的。我觉得这个问题十分严重，如果不及时纠正，不光是一九五一织布工作法不能推行，就是其他许多新工作法也将没法推广和巩固。有关领导干部应好好考虑，迅速加以纠正。
