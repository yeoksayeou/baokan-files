    Errors in the "Student Small Dictionary" Published by Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore
    Popular dictionaries are urgently needed by the broad masses of people today. Therefore, the compilers of such dictionaries must pay close attention to the content of the dictionary and ensure that it is correct and accurate. However, some popular dictionaries I have recently seen are not only outdated in content but also full of errors. For example, the "Student Small Dictionary" (new 17th edition, December 1951) edited and published by Shanghai Guangyi Bookstore not only collects many useless single characters but also has fundamental errors in the explanation of many single characters. For example, it explains the word "侵" (qīn, invade) as "to go to war with soldiers." If this is the case, how can we distinguish between "aggression" and "self-defense war"? The dictionary explains the word "京" (jīng, capital) as "the place where the President resides." May I ask, in our capital, where is there a "President"? The dictionary also explains many feudal and superstitious words and single characters without any criticism, such as saying "people die and become ghosts," "where dragons emerge, there will be floods," and "women refer to themselves as concubines." I think this kind of dictionary is extremely harmful to the masses and should be revised quickly.
                                                                                                                                  Zheng Dagong

    上海广益书局出版的“学生小字典”内容有错误
    通俗字典是今天广大人民所迫切需要的，因此，这类字典的编纂者必须十分注意字典的内容，务使它正确无误才好。但是，我最近看到的一些通俗字典，不只内容陈腐，并且谬误百出。如上海广益书局编辑和出版的“学生小字典”（一九五一年十二月新十七版），不只收集了许多毫无用处的单字，而且对很多单字的解释有原则性的错误。例如，它把“侵”字解释为“带了兵去打仗”。如果照这样说法，“侵略”和“自卫战争”怎样区别呢？字典中把“京”字解释为“大总统居住的地方”。请问在我们的首都，那有什么“大总统”呢？字典中对许多封建迷信的词语和单字，也丝毫不加批判地进行解释，如说什么“人死为鬼”，“出蛟的地方要发大水”，“妇人自称叫妾”等。我觉得这种字典对群众是极端有害的，应该迅速修正。 郑大公
