A Struggle to Implement the Mao Zedong Line on Literature and Art

Chairman Mao Gave Me a New Literary Life
Lao She

Editor's Note: To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," this newspaper publishes Mr. Lao She's article today and will successively publish articles by other writers and records of forums on literary and art issues by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some of these articles and records are reflections on studying Comrade Mao Zedong's speech, and some are opinions on literary and art work. The former demonstrates the achievements of the current rectification movement in literary and art circles, while the latter can serve as a reference for improving current literary and art work. We hope readers will pay attention.

Before studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I could not have written anything like what I have written in the past two years. Although what I have written in the past two years is not very good, it is essentially different from my pre-liberation works.

Although I started learning literary writing in 1924, I never really understood what to write, how to write, and for whom to write. My initial motivation for writing was seeing others write, and I wanted to try it too. I wanted to write, I wanted to publish what I wrote, and I hoped to become a literary writer. I didn't care about anything else.

After publishing one or two "works," I began to receive requests for contributions, and I couldn't stop writing. I really became a "writer." At this time, for whom was I writing? Mostly for myself, and partly for the readers; I had readers and couldn't abandon them. Who were my readers? Generally speaking, they were mostly petty bourgeoisie and some intellectuals. Why were they my readers? Because we had similar tastes – my thoughts were not far from theirs, and my thoughts would not scare them. They valued humor, and I wrote humorously. At this time, I was still writing for myself, but I also had to consider the readers. The so-called "considering the readers" did not mean that I wanted to educate them, but rather to cater to their tastes.

To enrich my literary knowledge, I also read literary works and literary theories besides writing.

I read some world-renowned literary works. However, I didn't understand their true value. I only used my personal taste to judge their merits. My taste was that of the petty bourgeoisie. I would admire witty words, funny plots, or a beautiful description of scenery; I didn't care about their educational or literary value.

I also read some literary theories. However, because I didn't have a central idea myself, I couldn't critically understand them. I could only say that someone in a certain era advocated this, and someone else in another era advocated that, but I couldn't say why, or which one was right and which one was wrong. This made me feel depressed, and I even slowly began to dislike theory. I would say: Write! Don't worry about theory! Works are real, theory is empty. So, I wrote whatever came to mind and considered it a work; I even published something with errors like "Cat Country"!

Yes, I also described the working people and the oppressed. However, that was because I had suffered and been oppressed since I was a child, and I wanted to vent my grievances by using them as a topic. I had the sense of justice of the petty bourgeoisie. Because it was the sense of justice of the petty bourgeoisie, I didn't dare to make revolution, so the oppressed people in my writing didn't dare to make revolution either. I only wrote about my sympathy for them, but I didn't dare and couldn't point out a way out for them. I used their language, appearance, and life to depict some gloomy scenes, in which there was no struggle, and therefore no hope or light. Someone asked me why I only wrote about tragic scenes and not about inspiring struggles. I always said: The Kuomintang's book censorship is very strict! Instead of saying that I had neither understanding of nor enthusiasm for revolutionary struggle. In the struggle between literature and art and politics, I drew a line; I was engaged in literature and art, and politics was another matter.

Indeed, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, I wrote popular literature such as Beijing opera drum lyrics to "serve" the masses. In fact, this "service" spirit was far less than my self-satisfaction and arrogance: I considered myself an all-around literary writer, who could even write Beijing opera drum lyrics! No matter what I wrote, I always started by proving that I was a literary man. The treasures of such a literary man like me were words and literary forms; I had these two treasures; whether it was popular or elegant, I could write it; sometimes I would even write an old-style poem in five or seven characters per line to show off my skills! As for the ideological nature and combat tasks of literature and art, I never cared about them.

At the end of 1949, after returning from abroad, the first thing I found was a copy of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The first article I read was Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

After reading this great article, I couldn't help but feel ecstatic. In all the literary theories I had read before, none had told me so clearly: who literature and art should serve, and how to serve. However, after the ecstasy, I became worried. What should I do? Should I continue to engage in literature and art, or should I give it up? Looking at the mirror that Chairman Mao gave me, the face of my literary writer was very blurry. Before, I thought I was a complete writer; at this moment, besides the fact that I could master words and understand some literary forms, I had nothing! Chairman Mao instructed: Literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. What should I do? From the time I started learning literary writing, for more than 20 years, my thoughts, life, and works had always been circling in the petty bourgeoisie. My farthest "vision" was that the masses of the people should be educated and have the ability and right to enjoy literature and art. What kind of literature and art should they enjoy? Simple: I write, everyone reads. What do I write? Anything! I write anything, everyone reads anything. A petty bourgeois can indeed be so arrogant and ignorant. This arrogance made me, as Chairman Mao said, lack contact, lack understanding, lack research, lack intimate friends with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not be good at depicting them. I was really worried.

Chairman Mao put forward the principle that literature and art should be subordinate to politics. This made me even more at a loss. I had been in the circle of the petty bourgeoisie for so long that my thoughts, life, and works had slowly become paralyzed. I often felt that I could not absorb any new ideas and still write things as before. My way of life seemed to be exactly what a literary man should have, and there was no need to change it. As for the works, whether they had content or not, it was fine as long as they were written smoothly and fluently. Such paralysis had been going on for a long time, making it impossible for me not to admit: Literature and art could not only be separated from politics, but should also be separated; life would be better if they were separated! I thought that by relying on a little cleverness and a long writing experience, I could safely and stably eat the literary rice bowl forever. However, Chairman Mao told me and people like me: You are wrong, literature and art should be subordinate to politics!

What should I do?

First of all, I made up my mind: I want to listen to Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao! It is glorious to listen to Chairman Mao! If I don't seek progress and still consider myself an old writer, and even refuse to listen to Chairman Mao, it is self-abandonment! I want to find my new literary life in Chairman Mao's instructions.

Now that I had decided on my attitude, where should I start to put it into practice? I didn't dare to casually find something new and start writing novels or plays; I had neither revolutionary training nor enough ideological transformation, learning, and experience of new social life. If I rashly went to write large-scale works, there would inevitably be many mistakes. I had to forget that I was a writer with more than 20 years of writing experience, and regard myself as a primary school student, starting from scratch. So, I decided to write popular literature first. This doesn't mean that popular literature is easy to write, and that ideological and artistic quality can be discounted, but rather that popular literature, like clapper talk and cross talk, doesn't have to be very long and is relatively easy to master.

In the past, it would take me about two or three days to finish a drum lyric of about a hundred lines; now, it takes seven or eight days. I have to write and rewrite, revise and revise. In terms of writing, I must try my best to control it, neither using flowery or clichéd words, nor failing to clearly convey new ideas in popular language, which is very difficult. In terms of thought, there are even more difficulties. When I decide to write about something, I must already have a certain degree of understanding of that thing. However, when it comes to writing, that understanding is still not enough, because a work, no matter how short, must be solid and specific everywhere. My understanding is only roughly correct, so the poverty and shortcomings of only knowing one thing and not knowing the other will inevitably be revealed between the lines. Sometimes, the main points are written well, but the sub-points violate the policy. Sometimes, the thoughts are written correctly, but the words are weak and powerless, without emotion – simply translating political thoughts, without the enthusiasm that political thoughts should have, will certainly not have the power to move people. Sometimes... There are many difficulties! But I decided: first, don't be impatient, and second, don't be afraid to ask others for advice. I have decided to listen to Chairman Mao's instructions: ideological transformation must be thorough, and it must be a long-term matter; I cannot be impatient. I must constantly learn in order to solve it thoroughly. In the past, I could rely on "inspiration" and write whatever came to mind, only seeking my own pleasure for a while, but not being responsible to the readers. Now, I must be responsible for political thought and responsible to the readers. Being eager for success will lead me to despair and self-abandonment. On the other hand, I must always ask others for advice. Often, my guests, Communist Party members, or people with new ideas, become my critics; I ask them to sit for a while and listen to me read the manuscript; a manuscript has to be read many times; each time I read it, I revise it. My own thoughts are not enough, everyone's thoughts will enrich me; when they give me advice, they often not only point out the mistakes in the work, but also talk about the problems in my thoughts, making me understand the root cause of why I wrote it wrong.

In this way, writing a short passage has given me some benefits. Although I haven't learned many new ideas from books (I am still a little afraid of reading theoretical books today), because of constant writing and constant asking for advice, I have gradually understood how I should put political thought in the first place, and not be complacent about getting one or two beautiful sentences as before. Although I have a serious leg problem and cannot immediately go to factories, rural areas, or troops to experience life, because of constant writing of popular literature, I have already realized the importance of learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers; as long as my leg problem gets better, I will learn from them. Although the popular literary works I have written in the past two years are not without problems, they have given me a lot of encouragement: putting down the burden of the old writer, not being afraid of hardship, and being happy to accept criticism, even a writer like me, who has no foundation in learning and has quite backward thoughts, still has the possibility of transforming himself and the hope of serving the people.

No matter how small a story I write, I must come into contact with the new social life; writing behind closed doors, today, I won't even be able to write a sentence. To write a short passage of drum lyrics, I have to investigate a lot of materials, and ask clearly what kind of political and ideological requirements there are. In this way, I learned how the new society is developing and what guiding ideology it is developing according to. Gradually, the more I came into contact with it, the more I loved this new society that is developing and progressing every day. Yes, I must say it again, I lack systematic learning of political theory and literary theory. However, when I saw the new atmosphere and new things of the new society because of the need for writing, I couldn't help but be moved. I want to sing the praises of the new things in this new society, and I have an enthusiasm for loving the society and the country that I have never had before. Naturally, some people say that I see first and then praise, and that I am passive and will not write works with high ideological content and creativity. However, I am a person who came from the old society, and if I boast that I can immediately transform into today's thinker, I am deceiving myself and others. I can only enthusiastically recognize the new society, and sing the praises of as much as I recognize; I should not abandon singing the praises because my voice is weak. If I can't write large-scale novels, I will use dozens of sentences of clapper talk to sing the praises. With my small talent, I should not fantasize about writing a sensational work in one go; if I can't be sensational, I won't even write clapper talk, I will completely lose my literary life and become a waste. I no longer want to use my works to prove that I am a great literary man, I want to prove that I am a small soldier in the new literary and art army, and although my legs and feet are not agile, I still grit my teeth and run forward with everyone.

Slowly, I started writing scripts. The backgrounds of "Fang Zhenzhu" and "Longxu Ditch" are both Beijing; I am a Beijinger, and I know something about Beijing. I love Beijing, and when I see the progress and development of Beijingers and Beijing city after liberation, I can't help but feel ecstatic and want to sing the praises. I have always been proud of being born in Beijing, and now I am even more proud. Beijing city belongs to Chairman Mao, and Beijingers and Beijing city have all been turned over and made progress in Chairman Mao's grace. How can I not write out my gratitude to Chairman Mao and the gratitude of the Beijingers!

These two scripts (although "Longxu Ditch" describes the working people) are not about workers, peasants, and soldiers; I still don't dare to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers, not because I don't want to. I must intensify my learning, intensify the correction of the petty bourgeoisie's preferences and prejudices, and participate in the struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, in order to write works that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. These two scripts themselves also have a common shortcoming: they describe people from the old society well, but they don't describe the new people and new characters in the new society so well. I understand the "old" people, but I don't understand the new characters very well. This is a big lesson – although I try to run forward, the burden I carry is too heavy after all, and I can't run fast! The new characters have already advanced ten miles, and I have only moved half a mile forward! This also warns me: to write about workers, peasants, and soldiers, I must put in a great effort, and I must not be rash and reckless! Only by relying on a little superficial observation to start writing about them will I inevitably distort them!

Before liberation, my writing method was to write and revise myself, not asking anyone for anything; after publishing, I would be happy if I received good criticism, and I would just laugh it off if I received bad criticism. My current writing method is: as soon as I start writing, I prepare to revise, and I never fantasize about finishing it in one go. The first draft is just "clearing the wasteland," and I don't expect it to stand firm at all. After the first draft is finished, I read it aloud to the literary group or temporarily invited friends. If everyone thinks there are merits, I will rewrite it from scratch; if everyone thinks there is nothing to take, I will throw it away. If it is the former, I will rewrite it once, twice, up to seven or eight times. Some people say: Everyone helps, how can this be considered your own work? I said: Neither I nor my friends are so stingy! I am grateful for everyone's help, and everyone is willing to help; the literary group always makes suggestions to me after collective and detailed discussions. Treasuring my own worthless things, refusing to ask everyone for advice, and refusing to change a word is exactly my bad habit before. After revising it seven or eight times, if the ideological nature is still not very strong, I will still throw it away. I am not afraid of suffering in vain, and I will not suffer in vain – writing it seven or eight times will give me the benefits of writing it seven or eight times, and it is not necessary to publish it to be considered a benefit. I regret it very much that I sometimes can't hold my breath and easily publish things that are not very good. In this way, I am writing desperately all year round, whether it is published or not, I want to touch the pen every day. This seems to be close to boasting. However, why not be proud of getting the opportunity to transform myself and getting a new literary life in the glory of Chairman Mao? Chairman Mao told me what to write, how to write, and for whom to write, shouldn't I be grateful, shouldn't I desperately follow? Yes, I know, I am still very, very far from a writer of Mao Zedong Thought. But, I must follow Chairman Mao's instructions step by step, and never stop. In terms of thought and life, I still have many problems that I want to correct one by one in order to lighten the burden and move forward faster. The things I wrote before liberation can only be regarded as language exercises; in the future, I hope that the things I write can become exercises after studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Only in this way will I not be hindered by the burden of the "old writer" from my progress, can I humbly accept criticism, and can I get a new literary life.
 I thank Chairman Mao!
 Long live Chairman Mao!

### 毛主席给了我新的文艺生命

专栏：为贯彻执行毛泽东文艺路线而斗争

    毛主席给了我新的文艺生命
    老舍
    编者按：为了纪念毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表的十周年，本报今日刊载老舍先生的这篇文章，并将陆续刊载其他作家的几篇文章以及工农兵读者关于文艺问题的座谈记录。这些文章和记录，有的是学习毛泽东同志这篇讲话的一些体会，有的是对于文艺工作提出的意见。前者表现了目前文艺界整风运动所达到的成就，后者则可以作为改进目前文艺工作的参考，希望读者注意。
    在学习毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话以前，我不可能写出像最近二年来我所写的东西。这二年来我所写的东西虽然并不怎么好，可是和我的解放前的作品比较起来，本质上是大不相同了。
    虽然我从一九二四年就开始学习文艺写作，可是始终不大明白应当写什么，怎么写，和应当为谁写。我的最初的写作动机是看见别人写，我也要试试，我要写，我要发表我所写的，我希望成为文艺作家。别的，我不管。
    发表了一两篇“作品”以后，就有人来约稿了，我不能不再写。我真的成了一个“作家”。这时候我又为谁写呢？多半是为我自己，小半是为读者；我有了读者，不可放弃。我的读者是谁呢？大概地说，他们多半是小市民和一部分知识分子。他们为什么是我的读者呢？因为气味相投——我的思想和他们的思想距离不大，我的思想不会教他们害怕。他们讲趣味，我写的有趣味。这时节，我还是为自己写作，不过捎带着要顾及读者。这里所谓的“顾及读者”并不是我要给他们什么教育的意思，而是要迎合他们的趣味。
    为丰富自己的文艺知识，在写作之外，我也读文艺作品和文艺理论。
    我读过一些世界文艺名著。可是，我并不明白它们的真正价值何在。我只用个人的趣味去判断它们的高低。我的趣味是小市民的，遇到俏皮的文字，招笑的情节，或一段漂亮的写景，我就赞叹不已；究竟那有什么教育价值与文艺价值，我不过问。
    我也读过一些文艺理论。可是，因为我自己没有个中心思想，就没法子批判地理解它们。我只能说某时代某人的主张如此，另一时代另一人的主张如彼，而说不出为何如此如彼，也说不出哪个对，哪个不对。这使我感到苦闷，甚至慢慢地厌弃理论。我会说：写吧，不必管理论！作品是真东西，理论是空洞的。这样，我便信笔一挥，写出来就算作品；甚至写出“猫城记”那样有错误的东西，也拿去发表！
    是的，我也描写过劳苦大众，和受压迫的人。不过那是因为我自幼受过苦，受过压迫，愿意借题发挥，把心中的怨气发泄出来。我有小资产阶级的正义感。正因为那是小资产阶级的正义感，我可是不敢革命，于是我笔下的受压迫的人也不敢革命。我只写出我对他们的同情，而不敢也不能给他们指出一条出路。我用他们的语言、形相、生活等等描画出一些阴森晦暗的景象，其中可没有斗争，也就没有希望与光明。有人问到我为什么只写悲惨的景象，不写激壮的斗争呢？我总是说：国民党的图书检查制度很严哪，而不说自己对革命斗争既无认识，又无热情。在文艺与政治斗争当中，我画上了一条线；我是搞文艺的，政治是另一回事。
    真的，在抗日战争中我就写过京戏鼓词之类的通俗文艺，为大众“服务”。其实呢，这点“服务”精神远不及我的自得自傲：我自居为全能的文艺作家，连京戏鼓词也会写！不管写什么，我总是由证明我是个文人出发。我这样的文人的法宝是文字与文艺形式；我有这两件法宝；通俗也好，典雅也好，我都能写；有时候还写一首五言或七言的旧诗，显显本事呢！至于文艺的思想性，和战斗任务，我向来不关心。
    一九四九年年尾，由国外回来，我首先找到了一部“毛泽东选集”。头一篇我读的是毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话。
    读完了这篇伟大的文章，我不禁狂喜。在我以前所看过的文艺理论里，没有一篇这么明确地告诉过我：文艺是为谁服务的，和怎么去服务的。可是，狂喜之后，我发了愁。我怎么办呢？是继续搞文艺呢，还是放弃它呢？对着毛主席给我的这面镜子，我的文艺作家的面貌是十分模糊了。以前，我自以为是十足的一个作家；此刻，除了我能掌握文字，懂得一些文艺形式之外，我什么也没有！毛主席指示：文艺须为工农兵服务。我怎么办呢？从我开始学习文艺写作起，二十多年来，我的思想、生活、作品都始终是在小资产阶级里绕圈圈。我最远的“远见”是人民大众应当受教育，有享受文艺的能力与权利。享受什么样的文艺呢？很简单：我写，大家念。我写什么呢？随便！我写什么，大家念什么。一个小资产阶级的确是可以这样狂傲无知的。这种狂傲使我对于工农兵，恰如毛主席所说的，缺乏接近，缺乏了解，缺乏研究，缺乏知心朋友，不善于描写他们。我真发了愁。
    毛主席提出了文艺服从于政治的道理。这又使我手足失措。我在小资产阶级的圈子里既已混了很久，我的思想、生活、作品，已经都慢慢地瘫痪了。我每每觉得我可以不吸收任何新思想，还是照旧可以写东西。我的生活方式呢，似乎也恰好是一个文人所应有的，不必改变。作品呢，不管有无内容，反正写得光滑通顺，也就过得去了。这样的瘫痪已久，使我没法子不承认：文艺不但可以和政治分家，也应当分家；分了家日子好过！我以为，仗着一点小聪明和长时间的写作经验，我就可以安安稳稳地永远吃文艺饭。可是，毛主席告诉了我和类似我的人：你们错了，文艺应当服从政治！
    我怎么办呢？
    首先，我决定了态度：我要听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席走！听从毛主席的话是光荣的！假若我不求进步，还以老作家自居，连毛主席的话也不肯听，就是自暴自弃！我要在毛主席的指示里，找到自己的新文艺生命。
    态度决定了，我该从哪里下手去实践呢？我不敢随便地去找一点新事物，就动手写小说或剧本；我既没有革命锻炼，又没有足够的思想改造学习和新社会生活的体验，若是冒冒失失地去写大部头的作品，必会错误百出。我得忘了我是有二十多年写作经验的作家，而须自居为小学生，从头学起。这样，我决定先写通俗文艺。这并不是说，通俗文艺容易写，思想性与艺术性可以打折扣，而是说通俗文艺，像快板与相声，篇幅都可以不求很长，较比容易掌握。
    在从前，我写一篇一百句左右的鼓词，大概有两三天就可以交卷；现在，须用七八天的工夫。我须写了再写，改了再改。在文字上，我须尽力控制，既不要浮词滥调，又须把新的思想用通俗语言明确地传达出来，这很不容易。在思想上，困难就更多了。当我决定写某件事物的时候，对那件事物我必定已有一定程度的了解。可是，赶到一动笔，那点了解还是不够用，因为一篇作品，不管多么短小，必须处处结实、具体。我的了解只是大致不差，于是字里行间就不能不显出只知其一，不知其二的贫乏与毛病。有时候，正笔写得不错，而副笔违反了政策。有时候，思想写对了，可是文字贫弱无力，没有感情——只把政治思想翻译一下，而没有对政治思想所应有的热情，就一定不会有感动的力量。有时候……。困难很多！可是我决定：第一不要急躁，第二不要怕求教别人。我既决定听从毛主席的指示：思想改造必须彻底，也就必是长时间的事；我就不能急躁。我必须经常不断的学习，以求彻底解决。以前，我可以凭“灵感”，信笔一挥，只求自己快意一时，对读者却不负责任。现在，我要对政治思想负责，对读者负责。急于成功会使我由失望而自弃。另一方面，我须时时请教别人。时常，我的客人，共产党员或是有新思想的人，就变成我的批评者；我要求他们多坐一会儿，听我朗读文稿；一篇稿子不知要朗读多少回；读一回，修改一回。我自己的思想不够用，大家的思想会教我充实起来；当他们给我提出意见的时候，他们往往不但指出作品上的错处，而且也讲到我的思想上的毛病，使我明白为什么写错了的病根。
    这样，写一小段，我就得到了一些好处。虽然我从书本上学来的新思想不很多（到今天我还是有些怕读理论书籍），可是因为不断地习作，不断地请教，我逐渐地明白了我应当怎样把政治思想放在第
    一位，而不许像从前那样得到一二漂亮的句子便沾沾自喜。虽然我因有严重的腿疾，不能马上到工厂、农村、或部队里去体验生活，可是因为不断地习写通俗文艺，我已经知道了向工农兵学习的重要；只要腿疾好些，我就会向他们学习去。虽然二年来我所写过的通俗文艺作品并非都没有毛病，可是这已给了我不少鼓励：放下老作家的包袱，不怕辛苦，乐于接受批评，就是像我这样学问没什么根底，思想颇落后的作家，也还有改造自己的可能，有去为人民服务的希望。
    不管我写多么小的一个故事，我也必须去接触新的社会生活；关起门来写作，在今天，准连一句也写不出。为写一小段鼓词，我须去调查许多资料，去问明白有什么样政治思想上的要求。这样，我就知道了一些新社会是怎样在发展，和依照着什么领导思想而发展的。一来二去，接触的多了，我就热爱这个天天都在发展进步的新社会了。是的，我必须再说一遍，我缺乏有系统的学习政治理论与文艺理论。可是，赶到因为写作的需要，看到了新社会的新气象新事物，我就不能不动心了。我要歌颂这新社会的新事物，我有了向来没有的爱社会国家的热情。自然，有人说我这样先看见，后歌颂，是被动的，不会写出有很高思想性与创造性的作品来。可是，我是由旧社会过来的人，假若我自诩能够一下子便变成为今天的思想家，就是自欺欺人。我只能热情地去认识新社会，认识多少，就歌颂多少；我不应该因我的声音微弱而放弃歌颂。写不了大部头的小说，我就用几十句快板去歌颂。以我的小小的才力，我不该幻想一写就写出一鸣惊人的作品来；若因不能一鸣惊人，就连快板也不写，我便完全丧失了文艺生命，变成废物。我不再想用作品证明我是个了不起的文人，我要证明我是新文艺部队里的一名小兵，虽然腿脚不利落，也还咬着牙随着大家往前跑。
    慢慢地，我开始写剧本。“方珍珠”与“龙须沟”的背景都是北京；我是北京人，知道一些北京的事情。我热爱北京，看见北京人与北京城在解放后的进步与发展，我不能不狂喜，不能不歌颂。我一向以生在北京自傲，现在我更骄傲了，北京城是毛主席的，北京人与北京城都在毛主席的恩惠中得到翻身与进步，我怎能不写出我的与北京人的对毛主席的感谢呢！
    这两个剧本（虽然“龙须沟”里描写了劳动人民）都不是写工农兵的；我还不敢写工农兵，不是不想写。我必须加紧学习，加紧矫正小资产阶级的偏爱与成见，去参加工农兵的斗争生活，以期写出为工农兵服务的作品。这两个剧本本身也有个共同的缺点，对由旧社会过来的人描写得好，对新社会新生的人物描写得不那么好。我了解“老”人，不十分了解新人物。这是个很大的教训——我虽努力往前跑，可是到底背着的包袱太重，跑不快！新人物已经前进了十里，我才向前挪动了半里！这也警告了我：要写工农兵非下极大的工夫不可，万不可轻率冒失！只凭一点表面上的观察便动笔描写他们，一定会歪曲了他们的！
    解放前，我的写作方法是自写自改，一切不求人；发表了以后，得到好批评就欢喜，得到坏批评就一笑置之。我现在的写作方法是：一动手写就准备着修改，决不幻想一挥而就。初稿不过是“砍个荒子”，根本不希望它能站得住。初稿写完，就朗读给文艺团体或临时约集的朋友们听。大家以为有可取之处，我就去从新另写；大家以为一无可取，就扔掉。假若是前者，我就那么再写一遍、两遍、到七八遍。有人说：大家帮忙，这怎能算你自己的作品呢？我说：我和朋友们都不那么小气！我感谢大家的帮忙，大家也愿意帮忙；文艺团体给我提意见总是经过集体地详密地讨论了的。敝帚千金，不肯求教大家，不肯更改一字，才正是我以前的坏毛病。改了七遍八遍之后，假若思想性还不很强，我还是扔掉它。我不怕白受累，而且也不会白受累——写七八遍就得到写七八遍的好处，不必非发表了才算得到好处。我很后悔，我有时候还是沉不住气，轻易地发表了不很好的东西。这样，我终年是在拚命的写，发表也好，不发表也好，我要天天摸一摸笔。这似乎近于自夸了。可是，为什么在毛主席的光荣里，得到改造自己的机会，得到了新的文艺生命，而不敢骄傲呢？毛主席告诉了我应当写什么，怎么写，和为谁写，我还不感谢么，还不拚命追随么？是的，我知道，我离着一个毛泽东思想的作家还很远很远。但是，我一定要按着毛主席所指示的一步一步的往前走，决不停止。在思想上，生活上，我还有不少的毛病，我要一一的矫正，好减轻负担，向前走得快一些。解放前我写过的东西，只能当作语文练习；今后我所写的东西，我希望，能成为学习了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话以后的习作。只有这样，我才不会教“老作家”的包袱阻挡住我的进步，才能虚心地接受批评，才能得到文艺的新生命。
  我感谢毛主席！
  毛主席万岁！
