    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 20th: The Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, which was unreasonably ordered to cease publication by the British Hong Kong government on May 6th, resumed publication on the 18th. This newspaper of the Chinese people, which has been missed by tens of thousands of readers for the past twelve days, was warmly welcomed by the vast number of residents in Hong Kong when it was republished on the morning of the 18th.
    The Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao was granted permission to resume publication on the 17th when the Hong Kong British High Court heard its appeal. The British Hong Kong government, on the pretext that Ta Kung Pao published a short commentary from the Beijing People's Daily protesting the British Hong Kong government's arrest and killing of Chinese residents, sentenced the newspaper to a six-month suspension on the so-called charge of "publishing seditious words," and sentenced the newspaper's负责人, Fei Yimin, and Li Zongying, to fines or imprisonment. This is completely unreasonable and illegal. When the British Hong Kong High Court pronounced its sentence on the 5th, the defendant immediately and solemnly announced in court that it would appeal and requested that the suspension order be suspended pending the appeal. However, the British Hong Kong government blatantly ordered Ta Kung Pao to cease publication immediately.
    The unreasonable verdict of the British Hong Kong government against Ta Kung Pao is a serious provocative act of its deliberate destruction of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech of the Chinese people in Hong Kong. Therefore, since the British Hong Kong government announced its illegal verdict, the people of all China have been aroused to great indignation and launched a tide of angry protests. My Central People's Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement on May 10th lodging a serious protest with the British government, demanding that it cease all hostile actions.
    The Hong Kong High Court panel began hearing Ta Kung Pao's appeal on the 13th of this month and ruled on the 17th that the suspension order should be suspended. The panel also acknowledged when announcing this ruling that "a suspension order should be issued because if the appeal is successful, the entire basis of the suspension order will no longer exist." This proves once again the illegality of the British Hong Kong government's order to cease publication on May 5th.
    It is reported that the Hong Kong High Court has scheduled the hearing of the Ta Kung Pao appeal case for the 26th of this month. Although Ta Kung Pao has now resumed publication, the British Hong Kong government's illegal verdicts against Ta Kung Pao and its负责人 Fei Yimin, etc., have not yet been revoked, and the British Hong Kong government's persecution of Chinese residents has not yet ceased. Therefore, the people of all Guangdong and all of China are still closely watching the development of the situation in Hong Kong and are determined to make persistent efforts to support Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, Xin Wan Bao, and the vast number of Chinese residents in Hong Kong in their struggle for legitimate rights and interests.

### 香港大公报复刊

    香港大公报复刊
    【新华社广州二十日电】自五月六日起为香港英国政府无理勒令停刊的香港大公报，已于十八日复刊。这张十二天来为万千读者怀念不已的中国人民的报纸在十八日早晨重新出版时受到香港广大居民的热烈欢迎。
    香港大公报是十七日在香港英国高等法院合议庭受理其上诉时获准复刊的。香港英国政府曾以大公报刊载了本社所播北京人民日报抗议香港英国政府捕杀中国居民的一篇短评为藉口，对该报以所谓“刊载煽动文字罪”判处停刊六个月，判处该报负责人费彝民与李宗瀛罚款或徒刑。这是完全无理的、非法的。当香港英国高等法院五日宣判时，被告方面当庭即严正地宣布要进行上诉，并提出在上诉期间停刊命令应缓期执行。但是香港英国政府竟悍然勒令大公报立即停刊。
    香港英国政府对大公报无理判决，是其蓄意摧残在香港的中国人民新闻自由与言论自由的一个严重挑衅行为。因此，自从香港英国政府宣布其非法判决之后，全中国的人民都激起了极大的义愤，展开了抗议的怒潮。我中央人民政府外交部亦在五月十日发表声明向英国政府提出严重抗议，要求停止一切敌意行动。
    香港高等法院合议庭于本月十三日开始受理大公报的上诉，于十七日裁定大公报中止执行停刊令。合议庭于宣布这一裁定时也承认“应该颁发中止执行令，因为如果全案上诉胜利，则停刊令的整个基础就不复存在”。这又证明了香港英国政府五月五日勒令停刊的非法性。
    据悉，对于大公报的上诉案，香港高等法院已定于本月二十六日审理。现大公报虽已复刊，但香港英国政府对大公报及其负责人费彝民等的非法判决仍未撤销，香港英国政府对中国居民的迫害亦仍未停止。因此，全广东和全中国的人民仍在密切注意香港事态的发展，并决心再接再厉地支援大公报、文汇报、新晚报以及香港广大中国居民为正当权益的斗争。
