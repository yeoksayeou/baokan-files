    Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong from the Fifth Anniversary Celebration of the Founding of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we extend our most sincere and highest respect to you!
    Over the past five years, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have followed and implemented your policy of ethnic regional autonomy, established and consolidated new ethnic relations, and their patriotic spirit has grown unprecedentedly. Great improvements and enhancements have been made in economic and cultural life. Agricultural production has reached the level before liberation. The pastoral areas have witnessed a new atmosphere of "prosperity for both people and livestock." The population has stopped declining and begun to rise; the number of livestock has nearly doubled, with an average of more than thirty livestock per herdsman.
    Respected Chairman Mao: We, the people of all ethnic groups, deeply feel that this is the liberation and happiness brought to us by your great ethnic policy. In order to consolidate the People's Republic of China—a great family of friendly cooperation among all ethnic groups—and to defend our happy life, we will always unite around you and the Central People's Government. On the basis of the five years of construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we will strive to increase production, practice strict economy, continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, resolutely oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and unite with all brotherly ethnic groups across the country to build a great motherland that is independent, unified, prosperous, and strong.

    内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五周年大会
    向毛泽东主席的致敬电
    敬爱的毛主席：
    当我们庆祝内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五周年时，衷心地向您致最崇高的敬礼！
    五年来，内蒙古各族人民遵循着和实现着您的民族区域自治政策，建立和巩固着新的民族关系，爱国精神空前增长，在经济与文化生活方面得到了很大的改善和提高。农业生产已达到了解放以前的水平。牧业区出现了“人畜两旺”的新气象，人口停止下降，开始上升；牲畜增加将近一倍，平均每个牧民已拥有三十余头牲畜。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们各族人民深切感到这是您的伟大的民族政策给我们带来的解放和幸福。为了巩固中华人民共和国——各民族友爱合作的大家庭，为了保卫我们幸福的生活，我们将永远团结在您和中央人民政府的周围，在内蒙古自治区五年建设的基础上努力增加生产，厉行节约，继续加强抗美援朝工作，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略与全国各兄弟民族团结一致，建设独立、统一、繁荣、富强的伟大祖国。
