The Southwest, Qamdo, and Qinghai Ethnic Minority Visiting Groups
A Letter of Respect to Premier Zhou Enlai

Respected Premier Zhou:

We have come from remote areas to visit the mainland, and we have witnessed the great achievements of our motherland in politics, economy, and culture. We have seen Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups, and we have seen the bright and prosperous future of all ethnic groups in the country.

During the reigns of past dynasties, especially under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, our minority ethnic groups suffered from exploitation and oppression. The great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated us, granting us the rights of national equality; freedom of religious belief and customs have been respected. During this visit, we have been warmly welcomed and sincerely assisted everywhere we went. Almost everyone has treated us with the affection of brothers and sisters. Even the children innocently call us "Uncle," "Auntie," and "Grandpa," which fills us with indescribable warmth and allows us to experience the happiness of living in the great family of all ethnic groups in our great motherland.

Our motherland is great and lovely, and this visit has given us a deeper understanding of this.

Our motherland is advancing courageously. Despite the best efforts of imperialists and reactionaries, using any despicable and cruel means, they cannot hinder our progress! We were honored to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebrations, and what we saw and heard in Tiananmen Square has further strengthened our confidence.

Respected Premier Zhou, all of this is the result of the hard work of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government leading the people of the whole country, and it is also inseparable from your diligent work. We would like to express our utmost gratitude and respect to you.

When we came to Beijing, you took the time out of your busy schedule to warmly receive us and teach us to strengthen unity and cherish our motherland. We will never fail to live up to your teachings and will convey them to everyone, so that they will all faithfully unite under the banner of Chairman Mao, work hard in production, defend the motherland, promote patriotism, resolutely expel the aggressive forces of imperialism, eliminate reactionaries, and support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan quickly, to repay Chairman Mao and your kindness to us.

    西南、昌都、青海三个民族参观团
    给周恩来总理的致敬信
    敬爱的周总理：
    我们这次从边远的地方到内地来参观，看到了祖国在政治、经济和文化方面的伟大建设，看见了各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，看见了全国各民族人民的光明和欣欣向荣的前途。
    在历代王朝尤其是国民党反动派统治时期，我们少数民族受尽了剥削和压迫。伟大的中国共产党和毛主席使我们得到解放，享受了民族平等的权利；宗教信仰自由和风俗习惯都受到了尊重。我们这次出来参观，到处受到热烈的欢迎和诚挚的帮助，几乎没有一个人不是以兄弟姊妹般的情谊来接待我们，连小孩子都天真地称呼我们“伯伯”“叔叔”和“阿姨”，使我们感到难以形容的温暖，体验到了生活在伟大祖国的各民族大家庭中的幸福。
    祖国是伟大的，可爱的，这次参观使我们有了更深的认识。
    我们的祖国正在勇猛地前进着。尽管帝国主义和反动分子们费尽心机，使用任何卑鄙和残酷的手段，都不能阻碍我们的进步！我们荣幸地参加了“五一”国际劳动节，在天安门前的所见所闻益发加强了我们的信心。
    敬爱的周总理，这一切都是毛主席和中央人民政府领导全国人民辛勤奋斗的结果，同时是与您的勤劳的工作分不开的，我们谨以无比的感激向您致敬。
    我们来到北京，你抽出宝贵的时间，殷切地招待我们，并教导我们加强团结，爱护祖国。我们永远不会辜负您的教导，并将它传达给每一个人，使他们都忠实地在毛主席旗帜之下，紧紧地团结在一起，努力生产，保卫国防，发扬爱国主义，坚决地驱逐帝国主义的侵略势力，肃清反动分子，并支援人民解放军迅速解放台湾，来报答毛主席和您对我们的恩情。
