    Shandong Provincial Agency Savings Inspection Committee
    Reply Regarding the Incomplete Anti-Corruption Campaign at Shandong Normal College

    To the Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published a letter from Yang Yi and Chen Ling, criticizing the incomplete anti-corruption campaign at Shandong Normal College. We believe: (1) It is true that the anti-corruption campaign at the Normal College was incomplete. This is because the construction issues of the college have not been clarified. This issue is closely related to the problems of the Provincial Construction Company, and there are many problems with the Construction Company's construction in Jinan City, which cannot be clarified for the time being. Based on this situation, this committee decided to postpone the inspection of the construction part of the college and deal with it as a special case later. The anti-corruption campaign in other parts of the college has been basically completed. (2) The readers Yang Yi and Chen Ling's criticisms of the college president Tian Peizhi's appointment of private individuals and the serious bureaucraticism of the Dean of Studies Liu Lixing are basically true.

    山东省级机关节约检查委员会
    对山东师范学院反贪污运动不彻底的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报“读者来信”栏曾发表杨易、陈玲的来信，对山东师范学院反贪污运动不彻底提出批评。我们认为：（一）师范学院反贪污运动不彻底是真实的。因为该院修建部分的问题还没有搞清。这个问题和省建筑公司的问题密切关联，而建筑公司在济南市修建中的问题很多，一时还无法弄清。根据这一情况，本会即决定将该院修建部分的问题也暂缓检查，待后作专案处理。该院其他部分的反贪污运动，则已基本上搞彻底。（二）关于读者杨易、陈玲对该院院长田佩之任用私人和教务长刘力行官僚主义严重等的批评，基本上是真实的。
