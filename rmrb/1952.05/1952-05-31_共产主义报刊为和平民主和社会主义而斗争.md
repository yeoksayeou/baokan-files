    Communist newspapers and journals are constantly growing and developing, and they are the most effective and powerful weapon of the Party. Communist newspapers are the collective propagandists, agitators, and organizers of the masses. In the current stage of the struggle between the two camps, their role and tasks are extremely important.
    The newspapers and journals of the Communist and Workers' Parties resolutely and relentlessly expose the ugly conspiracies and bloody crimes against humanity of the imperialist robbers, and expose the warmongers and their agents—the right-wing socialist traitors and Titoite spies and assassins. The current task of the newspapers and journals of the democratic anti-imperialist camp is to save humanity from a new world war. This great task of truly world-historical significance inspires the newspapers and journals of the democratic camp to actively carry out their work. They vigorously publicize Stalin's brilliant insight: if the people of all countries take on the cause of defending peace and persist in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated.
    The newspapers and journals of the Communist and Workers' Parties tirelessly fight for peace and friendship among nations, exposing the imperialist aggressors hated by all honest people. They constantly and closely link the struggle for peace with the struggle against economic militarization in capitalist countries, against lowering the living standards of the working people and depriving them of their democratic rights, and with the struggle of the people for freedom, bread, and national independence.
    American imperialists are frantically piecing together various military blocs, binding the Marshallized countries with a series of sell-out treaties. Their "peace treaty" with Japan, and the "general treaty" with the West German puppet and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, are all links in a chain. The American rulers portray their aggressive plans as "peaceful" and "defensive," attempting to turn all capitalist countries into military bases and barracks for aggressive troops under the guise of these lies. However, bayonets cannot be concealed by a few diplomatic documents; preparations for war cannot be disguised by sweet words such as "love of peace." The masses of people in various countries are increasingly aware that the deceptive rhetoric of "defense" and "peace" uttered by the likes of Truman, Acheson, and Churchill actually means massacring women, children, and the elderly in Korea, restoring Japanese militarism and Hitler's "Wehrmacht," increasing unemployment, and lowering the living standards of the working class. The newspapers and journals of the Communist and Workers' Parties relentlessly expose the despicable tricks played by those twentieth-century cannibals who incite new wars, tearing off the "peace-loving" masks covering their animalistic faces.
    While the newspapers and journals of the Communist and Workers' Parties debunk the anti-Soviet slanders of the enemies of peace and socialism, they strive to promote the rapidly advancing communist construction in the Soviet Union, the magnificent Stalinist communist construction, the labor enthusiasm of the Chinese working people in carrying out outstanding socio-economic transformations, and the rapid development of economic and cultural undertakings in the people's democratic countries; they report on the growing world communist movement.
    The strength of the communist press lies in its close and unbreakable connection with the people, with the broad masses of working people; because it represents the truth, constantly and correctly reflects the vital interests of the workers and all working people, and consistently fights for these interests. Comrade Stalin said: The press is the most powerful weapon, and the Party uses this weapon to speak to the working class at any time in its own language, the language the Party needs.
    Because of its close ties with the masses and its struggle for the interests of the people, the communist press enjoys very high prestige among people of all strata.
    The glorious Bolshevik Party's "Pravda," selflessly fighting for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, is a shining example for all Communist and Workers' Party newspapers and journals. From its first issue, "Pravda" has been the center of the struggle to accomplish the great historical tasks; these historical tasks, both past and present, are put forward to the people by the great Communist Party, the Party of Lenin and Stalin. The entire history of "Pravda" is a history of uncompromising struggle against bourgeois ideology, against all kinds of bourgeois agents in the workers' movement, and against the enemies of the people and the Bolshevik Party, and it continues to carry out this struggle. The constant guidance of the press by the Party of Lenin and Stalin is the source of the prestige and strength of "Pravda" and all Bolshevik newspapers and journals. Because it has lofty ideals, represents the truth, adheres to the principles of the Party, and strives to serve the people, "Pravda" has won the love and universal approval of the Soviet people and progressive people all over the world.
    The traditions and experience of "Pravda" are an example and model for all Communist and Workers' Party newspapers and journals. The newspapers and journals of the people's democratic countries and the newspapers and journals of the Communist Parties in capitalist and colonial countries all draw lessons from the experience of "Pravda."
    Under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, the newspapers and journals of the people's democratic countries mobilize the working people to fight for peace and to build socialism, and educate the people in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and socialist patriotism. "People's Tribune" (Poland), "Red Rights" (Czechoslovakia), "Free People's Newspaper" (Hungary), "Spark" (Romania), "Workers' Affair" (Bulgaria), "Zeri i Popullit" (Albania), and other thousands of local newspapers and journals in the people's democratic countries are actively assisting the Communist and Workers' Parties in completing the task of building socialism.
    The contribution of the revolutionary press of China, especially the "People's Daily," to the people is indeed very great. The Chinese Communist Party strives to consolidate the system of the people's democratic dictatorship, constantly expands the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, and attracts millions of people to participate in political life. "People's Daily" is an active and tireless assistant to the Chinese Communist Party in implementing land reform, organizing patriotic production competitions to increase industrial production and improve industry, and in the struggle against corruption, bureaucracy, and exposing the crimes of the American and British imperialists.
    In the Korean people's war of liberation, the newspapers and journals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea played an extremely important role, mobilizing the masses of people to fully support the front lines and strengthen the struggle against the American aggressors.
    The press of the German Democratic Republic—first and foremost the "Neues Deutschland"—has made a very great contribution to the struggle of the German people for a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany.
    In capitalist countries, the communist press, under difficult conditions of terror and police persecution, has waged a selfless struggle for peace and the interests of the people. The advocates of a new world war are intent on confusing the working people, causing them to lose confidence in their future, while slandering and distorting the policies of the Communist and Workers' Parties in defending peace and striving to fundamentally improve the lives of the people, but the communist press gives these advocates of war a powerful rebuff with irrefutable truth. The communist press has consistently and vehemently exposed the profiteering imperialists, the right-wing socialist press, the filthy Titoite rags, and the insidious and vicious Vatican press.
    The French Communist Party's militant "L'Humanité" strongly denounces the profiteering nature of the French government, which betrays the nation, and the ugly behavior of pro-American ringleaders who are obsequious and subservient. The French bourgeoisie and its American masters see that the most vigorous attacks against them come from these democratic newspapers and journals. The fact that there have been more than eight hundred lawsuits against the democratic press since 1947—one hundred and thirty-nine of which were against "L'Humanité" alone—is proof of this.
    "Unità" is the militant organ of the Italian Communist Party, and it is waging a persistent struggle to unite all democratic and patriotic forces in the country, exposing the nation-selling policies of the Gasperi government; it is fighting for fundamental changes in the economic system, for a government that supports peace, and against the establishment of a clerical-fascist dictatorship at home.
    The communist press in colonial countries and dependent countries is becoming stronger and more powerful. The Communist Party of India's "Freedom Daily" is assisting the Party in uniting workers, peasants, cultural workers, and all progressive strata into a united democratic front. Recent events in Indian political life prove that the people's trust in the Communist Party is growing and the connection between the Party and the people is becoming closer.
    However, the communist press, if it does not dare to boldly and conscientiously criticize its own shortcomings and strive to overcome them, then it is not worthy of being a communist-Bolshevik press. Shortcomings still often exist in the various organs of the Communist and Workers' Parties; these shortcomings are often manifested in the lack of militancy in the content, insufficient contact with the broad readership, or condemnation of American imperialism that is not sharp enough, the inability to publicize the achievements of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in a lively and vivid style, the inability to thoroughly and comprehensively explain the basic issues of Marxist-Leninist theory, the workers' movement, and the struggle for peace to the masses, and so on. In the people's democratic countries, some newspapers and journals have not been able to properly study ideological issues and Party issues, have not paid deep attention to the development of economic life, and have not paid enough attention to criticism and self-criticism and raising the revolutionary vigilance of the masses.
    The constant, concrete, and in-depth leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties over the press will help to correct the shortcomings that have occurred in some Party newspapers, improve the level of the communist press, and make them a more powerful weapon in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

### 共产主义报刊为和平民主和社会主义而斗争

    共产主义报刊为和平民主和社会主义而斗争
    共产党和工人党的报刊是时时刻刻都在成长发展的，它是党的最有效和最有力的武器。共产主义报刊是群众的集体宣传者、鼓动者和组织者，在现阶段两个阵营的斗争中，它的作用和任务实在是异常重大的。
    共产党和工人党的报刊坚决地无情地揭发帝国主义强盗的丑恶阴谋和危害人类的血腥罪行，把战争贩子和他们的代理人——右翼社会党叛徒和铁托间谍暗杀分子暴露出来。民主反帝阵营的报刊的当前任务是拯救人类免于新的世界战争，这个真正具有世界历史意义的伟大任务，鼓舞着民主阵营的报刊积极进行工作。它大力向广大群众宣传斯大林的英明见解：如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。
    共产党和工人党的报刊不倦地为和平与各民族的友好而奋斗，揭发一切正直人士所痛恨的帝国主义侵略者，它把争取和平的斗争与反对资本主义国家实行经济军事化的斗争、反对降低劳动人民生活水平和剥夺人民的民主权利的斗争经常地、密切地联系起来，与人民群众争取自由、面包和民族独立的斗争经常地、密切地联系起来。
    美国帝国主义者正在手忙脚乱地拼凑种种军事集团，用一连串的卖身条约将马歇尔化的国家束缚起来。他们与日本签订的“和约”、与西德傀儡和北大西洋侵略集团签订的“一般性条约”，都是一条锁链上的环节。美国统治者把自己的侵略计划说成是“和平的”、“防御性的”，企图在这种鬼话的掩盖之下，把所有的资本主义国家都变成军事基地，变成侵略军的兵营。但是，刺刀是不能用几张外交文件掩盖得起来的；备战工作是不能用“热爱和平”这类甜蜜的语句来蒙混过去的。各国人民群众越来越认识到：杜鲁门、艾奇逊、邱吉尔之流所谈的“防御”、“和平”这些骗人的花言巧语，实际上就是屠杀朝鲜的妇孺老弱，恢复日本的军国主义和希特勒的“国防军”，增加失业和降低工人阶级的生活水平。共产党和工人党的报刊无情地揭穿那些煽动新战争的二十世纪吃人生番所玩弄的卑鄙把戏，撕下遮盖着他们那副畜生嘴脸的“热爱和平”的假面具。
    共产党和工人党的报刊一面拆穿和平和社会主义的敌人的反苏谰言，一面努力宣扬在突飞猛进中的苏联共产主义建设，宣扬宏伟的斯大林的共产主义建设，宣扬中国劳动人民在进行卓越的社会—经济变革中的劳动热情和人民民主国家经济与文化事业的迅速发展；报道一天天在发展的世界共产主义运动。
    共产党的报刊之所以具有力量，是因为它与人民、与广大的劳动人民群众有密切的牢不可破的联系；是因为它代表真理，经常地正确地反映工人们和全体劳动人民的切身利益，并一贯地为这些利益而奋斗。斯大林同志说过：报刊是最强有力的武器，党运用这个武器随时用自己的语言，党所需要的语言，来和工人阶级谈话。
    由于和群众有密切联系并为人民群众的利益而斗争，共产党的报刊在广泛的各阶层人民中享有非常崇高的威信。
    光荣的布尔什维克党的“真理报”，忘我地为和平、民主与社会主义事业而斗争，它是所有共产党和工人党报刊的光辉的榜样。“真理报”从创刊号起就一直是为完成历史性的伟大任务而斗争的中心；这些历史性的任务，无论过去和现在，都是由伟大的共产党、列宁—斯大林的党向人民提出来的。“真理报”的整个历史都是绝不妥协地为反对资产阶级思想意识而斗争，为反对工人阶级运动中各式各样的资产阶级代理人、为反对人民和布尔什维克党的敌人而斗争，而且继续进行这个斗争。列宁—斯大林的党对于报刊的经常的指导是“真理报”与布尔什维克党一切报刊的威信和力量的泉源。由于它有崇高的理想，代表真理，坚持党的原则性和竭力为人民服务，“真理报”博得了苏联人民和全世界进步人民的热爱和普遍的赞许。
    “真理报”的传统和经验是所有共产党和工人党报刊的榜样、典范。人民民主国家的报刊和资本主义国家内与殖民地国家内的共产党的报刊都从“真理报”的经验中取得教益。
    人民民主国家的报刊，在共产党和工人党的领导之下，动员劳动人民为争取和平、为建设社会主义而斗争，并以无产阶级国际主义与社会主义爱国主义的精神来教育人民群众。“人民论坛报”（波兰）、“红色权利报”（捷克斯洛伐克）、“自由人民报”（匈牙利）、“火花报”（罗马尼亚）、
    “工人事业报”（保加利亚）、“色力—伊—波普里特”（阿尔巴尼亚）和人民民主国家中其他千百种地方报刊，都在积极地协助共产党和工人党，来完成建设社会主义的任务。
    中国的革命的报刊，特别是“人民日报”，对于人民的贡献的确是很伟大的。中国共产党努力巩固人民民主专政的制度，不断扩大工人阶级和农民的联盟，吸引千百万的人民参加政治生活。“人民日报”是中国共产党在实行土地改革、组织爱国主义生产竞赛以增加工业生产并改进工业等工作中的积极的不疲倦的助手，是中国共产党在反对贪污、反对官僚主义、揭露美英帝国主义者的罪恶行为的斗争中的积极的不疲倦的助手。
    在朝鲜人民的解放战争中，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的报刊发挥了极其伟大的作用，它们动员人民群众，以全力支援前线和加强反抗美国侵略者的斗争。
    德意志民主共和国的报刊——首先是“新德意志报”，在德国人民为争取统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国的斗争中，有十分伟大的贡献。
    在资本主义国家中，共产党的报刊为了争取和平与人民的利益，在恐怖和警察迫害的艰难情况下，进行了忘我的斗争。新世界战争的鼓吹者一心想混淆劳动人民的视听，使他们对自己的前途丧失信心，同时对共产党和工人党维护和平与争取彻底改善人民生活的政策加以诽谤和歪曲，但是共产党的报刊用颠扑不破的真理，给予这些战争的鼓吹者以有力的还击。对于唯利是图的帝国主义者和右翼社会党的报刊，以及丑恶不堪的铁托分子的烂污报纸和阴险恶毒的梵蒂冈报纸，共产党的报刊一贯地、猛烈地予以揭露。
    法国共产党的战斗性的“人道报”强烈地指责出卖民族的法国政府的唯利是图的本质和亲美派头目们的奴颜婢膝的丑恶行径。法国的资产阶级和它的美国主子看出，抨击他们最猛烈的，就是这些民主的报刊。从一九四七年起，控告民主报刊的诉讼案件达八百多起——其中单是控诉“人道报”的就有一百三十九起，这一点就是证明。
    “团结报”是意大利共产党战斗的机关报，它为团结全国一切民主和爱国的力量，进行始终不懈的斗争，揭露加斯贝利政府出卖民族的政策；它正为争取经济制度的根本改变、为争取拥护和平的政府、为反对在国内建立僧侣—法西斯独裁统治而斗争。
    殖民地国家和附属国的共产党报刊越来越坚强有力了。印度共产党的“自由报”，正在协助党把工人、农民、文化工作者以及所有的进步阶层团结起来，成为一个统一的民主阵线。最近印度政治生活中所发生的一些事件，证明人民对共产党的信任日益增长，党和人民间的联系日益密切。
    但是，共产党的报刊，如果不敢大胆地、认真地批判自己的缺点，并努力克服这些缺点，那末，它就不成其为共产党——布尔什维克的报刊了。共产党和工人党的各种机关报刊，还常常存在着缺点；这些缺点，时常表现在内容的缺乏战斗性，与广大的读者联系不够，或谴责美国帝国主义不够尖锐，不能够以生动鲜明的风格来宣传苏联和人民民主国家的成就，不能够透彻详尽地向群众解释马克思—列宁主义理论、工人阶级运动以及争取和平的斗争的基本问题，等等。在人民民主国家，某些报刊没有能够恰当地研究思想问题和党内的问题，没有深刻地注意经济生活的发展，也没有足够地重视批评与自我批评和提高群众的革命警惕性。
    共产党和工人党对报刊予以经常的、具体而深入的领导，将有助于改正某些党报所发生的缺点，提高共产党报刊的水平，使它们在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中成为更有力的武器。
