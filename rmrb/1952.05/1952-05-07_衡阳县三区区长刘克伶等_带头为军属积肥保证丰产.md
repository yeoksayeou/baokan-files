    Hengyang County Third District Head Liu Keling and Others
    Take the Lead in Accumulating Fertilizer for Military Dependents to Ensure a Bumper Harvest
    Liu Keling, head of the Third District of Hengyang County, Hunan Province, took the lead in accumulating fertilizer for military dependents to ensure that the land of military dependents also yields a bumper harvest.
    On April 9, Liu Keling went to Songpo Township in the district to inspect preferential treatment work and found that the poor peasant military dependent Xiao Qisong did not apply enough fertilizer to his fields. On the morning of April 10, Liu Keling took off his shoes, carried a hoe, and dug up sod (grass with a layer of soil) in Songpo Township to use as fertilizer in Xiao Qisong's fields. Following this, district cadres Luo Yan, Zhou Nan, and county cooperative section cadre Li Jiasheng, who worked in the Third District, also carried hoes to dig up sod for military dependent Xiao Qisong as fertilizer. They formed a temporary farming group of eleven people. Everyone rushed to work, some digging, some carrying. In the afternoon, around four o'clock, military dependent Xiao Qisong arrived. He happily said, "My field is full of sod! I didn't dare to think about a bumper harvest before, but now that I have topdressing sod and a little bone meal, I am sure to have a bumper harvest. I will write to my son in the army and ask him to strive for meritorious service to repay everyone and Chairman Mao." Liu Keling and others' exemplary deeds have become a model for local cadres and farmers in preferential treatment work. Now, a wave of accumulating fertilizer for military dependents and ensuring a bumper harvest for military dependents has become a widespread movement in various townships in the Third District of Hengyang County.

    衡阳县三区区长刘克伶等
    带头为军属积肥保证丰产
    湖南省衡阳县三区区长刘克伶带头给军属积肥，保证军属的土地也丰收。
    四月九日，刘克伶到本区松陂乡检查优抚工作，发现贫农军属萧启松田里肥料下得不够。四月十日清早，刘克伶便打起赤脚、扛起锄头，在松陂乡刨草皮（带一层土的草）放在萧启松田里作肥料。接着，区干部罗炎、周南等，在三区工作的县合作科干部李家声等，都扛了锄头来为军属萧启松刨草皮作肥料。他们组成了一个十一人的临时代耕组。大家争先动手，刨的刨，挑的挑。下午四点多钟，军属萧启松来了，他高兴地说：“我田里都堆满了草皮！以前我不敢想丰产，现在有了顶肥的草皮，再下点牛骨粉，丰产硬是有把握了。我要写信给在部队里的儿子，要他争取立功来报答各位，报答毛主席。”刘克伶等的这种模范事迹成了当地干部、农民的优抚工作榜样。现在，给军属积肥、保证军属也丰产的热潮，在衡阳县三区各乡已经普遍形成运动。衡阳县三区生产委员会办公室
