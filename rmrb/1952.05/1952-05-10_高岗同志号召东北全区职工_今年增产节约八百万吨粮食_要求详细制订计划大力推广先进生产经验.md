Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th. Comrade Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, at a mobilization meeting for launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy in the Northeast region on the 7th, called on all state-owned and public factory and mine workers in the region to strive to complete the state's industrial construction plan in this year's focused and step-by-step large-scale economic construction, and to fight for overfulfilling the target of increasing production and practicing economy, creating wealth equivalent to eight million tons of grain.

More than 1,800 people attended the conference, including senior cadres from the Northeast Region, provinces and cities, and responsible cadres from various factories and mines. In his report, Gao Gang pointed out that last year, workers in the Northeast region increased production and practiced economy, creating huge wealth equivalent to 16 million tons of grain for the country. According to the central government's guidelines, this year's economic construction in the Northeast region will basically complete the recovery work, further enhance economic and defense strength, and begin focused and step-by-step large-scale economic construction in a more extensive and in-depth patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy. According to the national plan, the total output value of state-owned and public industries will increase by 41.5 percent compared to the actual total output value of last year. This figure shows that state-owned and public industries in the Northeast are growing at an astonishing rate. Last year, the total output value of state-owned and public industries increased by 24.1 percent compared to the previous year, and this year it has almost doubled compared to last year, far exceeding the industrial development in the history of all capitalist countries. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system. Gao Gang said that judging from this year's industrial and agricultural production increase plans, the total output value of industry and agriculture this year will exceed the highest level in the Northeast's past, 1943, by 24.8 percent, with industry (including private industry) exceeding it by 10 percent. The proportion of industrial output value in the total output value of industry and agriculture in the entire region will increase from 52.6 percent last year to 55.9 percent, and the proportion of industry will further increase. This year, the proportion of means of production in the output value of state-owned and public industries will increase from 65.3 percent last year to 67.5 percent. The fastest growing sector in industry is heavy industry. This year, the proportion of state-owned and public industries in the total industrial output value of the region will increase from 78.3 percent last year to 81.5 percent, which shows that the proportion of socialist factors in industry will be further strengthened. Therefore, completing this year's production increase plan is of extremely important significance.

Gao Gang listed the various important production targets for this year and called on all workers to overfulfill the state plan. He said that this year's industrial plan for the Northeast is a more advanced plan than last year's. Compared with last year, completing this plan is the biggest increase in production and economy. However, in addition to completing this year's national plan, we also require the country to increase production and practice economy, creating wealth equivalent to 8 million tons of grain (excluding the savings in working capital). Among them, the factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government are required to complete 5 million tons, and the industrial and mining enterprises under the other departments and bureaus of the Northeast People's Government and various provinces and cities are required to complete 3 million tons. Gao Gang pointed out that this is a very glorious task to accelerate China's industrialization! Eight million tons of grain is equivalent to nearly half of the total agricultural income of all farmers in Northeast China last year. If used to expand the country's machine industry, it can build thirteen new machine factories with 500 machine equipment and an annual output of 2,650 machine tools; if used to expand the agricultural machinery industry, it can build four and a half factories with an annual output of 30,000 tractors; if used to develop the transportation industry, it can build 3,350 kilometers of railways, or build five automobile manufacturing plants with an annual output of 50,000 vehicles; if used to develop the textile industry, it can build fifteen textile factories with 50,000 spindles and 2,000 looms; if used to improve the welfare of workers, it can build five million square meters of housing; if used for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and national defense construction, it can purchase 3,368 fighter planes or 5,614 cannons.

At this point, Gao Gang emphasized that it is entirely possible to achieve this glorious task. First of all, the proposal of this task has been carefully calculated by the national planning agencies and industrial management departments; secondly, the following favorable conditions make it possible to complete the above plan: (1) After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the political awareness of workers, technicians, and staff has been unprecedentedly improved, and they have become vigilant about the seriousness of the illegal bourgeoisie's attacks on the national economy, clarified the boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, clarified the status and future of the working class, and strengthened their confidence in consolidating the people's democratic system and victoriously moving towards socialism in the future. The enthusiasm of workers has been greatly enhanced, and there are more rationalization proposals than before. Many leading cadres of various factories and mines have generally received education, improved their thinking, and improved their work style in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. (2) Through the "Three-Anti" movement, a group of embezzlers and thieves were purged, and a large number of new workers and young intellectuals were trained and promoted to take on various leadership positions, thereby purifying and consolidating the organization of enterprises and strengthening the leadership of factories and mines.
(3) The decrease in national prices, the increase in workers' wages, and the supplementary provisions of the labor insurance regulations have further improved the material life of workers and increased the production enthusiasm of all workers. Their love for the motherland has been further strengthened, and their labor has become more conscious labor. (4) A lot of experience has been accumulated in last year's production increase and economy campaign, especially the large number of advanced experiences and advanced working methods that emerged in the campaign, which are important conditions for launching a widespread production increase and economy campaign this year. The planned promotion of these experiences will have a great impact on industrial production. (5) There are still great potential forces within industrial and mining enterprises, such as the utilization rate of equipment can be improved, the rejection rate can be reduced, the quality of products can be improved, the use of raw materials can be saved, the waste of labor can be greatly reduced, and the connection between labor organization and processes can be greatly improved. (6) There is assistance from Soviet experts. These are the guarantees of victory for overfulfilling the task of increasing production and practicing economy.

Gao Gang emphasized that time is important, and every day is important. We should give full play to these favorable conditions and quickly and on a large scale launch the movement. We must immediately shift the focus of leadership on the industrial front to organizing production. The work of pursuing赃款(zangkuan) and finalizing cases in the "Three-Anti" should be carried out by some cadres specifically; it is necessary to make everyone aware of the urgent significance of launching the production increase and economy campaign, break down various ideological obstacles, and specifically resolve the contradiction between pursuing赃款(zangkuan) and finalizing cases in the "Three-Anti" and leading the production increase and economy campaign. It is necessary to organize all workers to discuss this year's production, financial, and technical plans, as well as basic construction tasks, and formulate production increase and economy plans for each unit, group, and individual. It is necessary to vigorously promote advanced production experiences, especially the advanced production experiences of decisive significance in various industries, which is the key to completing this year's production increase and economy plan. It is necessary to make the work of promoting advanced production experiences a leading and regular work, and to regularly evaluate and implement rewards. It is necessary to pay attention to improving labor conditions, and specific plans must be made for factory ventilation and safety equipment. On the basis of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, we should continue to strengthen the political, cultural, and technical education of workers, and universally conduct education on communism and the Communist Party in political studies. The Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League must be consistent, work together, and jointly run the enterprise well. The political work in enterprises should regard the task of fighting against the bourgeois ideology that has invaded the ranks of the working class and the task of transforming the old ideology of non-working class as a fundamental and regular task. In order to undertake such a task, the leading backbone of the Party in the enterprise must seriously study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly sum up the experience of political work in the enterprise. This is an important guarantee for completing this year's production increase and economy plan.

Gao Gang finally pointed out that departments such as railways, trade, and cooperation should also formulate a realistic production increase and economy task and act like industrial departments. All organs, organizations, and enterprises in Northeast China should respond to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and universally launch a production increase and economy campaign to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, enhance the strength of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and accelerate the process of national industrialization. All localities should vigorously publicize this year's national plan and the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy, so that it is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

    高岗同志号召东北全区职工
    今年增产节约八百万吨粮食
    要求详细制订计划大力推广先进生产经验
    【新华社沈阳九日电】中共中央东北局书记高岗七日在东北区开展增产节约运动的动员大会上，号召全区国营、公营厂矿职工在今年有重点的有步骤的大规模经济建设中，努力完成国家的工业建设计划，并为超计划地增产节约价值等于八百万吨粮食的财富而奋斗。
    出席此次大会的有东北一级、省市一级的高级干部和各厂、矿的负责干部等一千八百多人。高岗在报告中指出：去年东北区职工为国家增产节约了价值一千六百万吨粮食的巨大财富。根据中央指示的方针，东北区今年的经济建设，将在更加广泛、更加深入的爱国增产节约运动中，基本上完成恢复工作、进一步增强经济力量与国防力量，并开始有重点地有步骤地大规模经济建设。按照国家的计划，国营公营工业的总产值，今年将比去年的实际总产值提高百分之四十一点五。这个数字表示：东北的国营和公营工业正以惊人的速度增长着；去年国营和公营工业的总产值，比前年增长了百分之二十四点一，今年差不多比去年增加了一倍，其速度大大地超过了一切资本主义国家历史上的工业发展。这充分显示出人民民主制度的优越性。高岗说：如从今年的工农业增产计划看，那么，今年工农业总产值将超过东北过去最高水平的一九四三年百分之二十四点八，其中工业（包括私营工业）超过百分之十。全区工农业总产值中的工业产值比重，将由去年百分之五十二点六提高到百分之五十五点九，工业的比重将进一步地增长。今年国营、公营工业产值中，生产手段所占的比重，将由去年百分之六十五点三提高到百分之六十七点五，在工业中发展最快的乃是重工业。今年国营、公营工业在全区工业总产值中所占的比重，将由去年的百分之七十八点三，提高到百分之八十一点五，这说明工业中的社会主义因素的比重将更加壮大。因此，完成今年的增产计划有着极其重大的意义。
    高岗列举了今年的各项重要生产指标后，号召全体职工超额完成国家计划。他说：今年东北的工业计划是一个比去年更加先进的计划，与去年相比，完成这个计划，就是最大的增产节约。但是，我们要求在完成今年的国家计划之外，还要为国家增产节约价值八百万吨粮食的财富（流动资金的节约不计算在内），其中要求东北人民政府工业部所属各厂、矿完成五百万吨，东北人民政府其他各部局及各省市所属工矿完成三百万吨。高岗指出：这是加速我国工业化的一个十分光荣的任务！八百万吨粮食，等于东北全体农民去年农业总收入的将近一半；如用以扩充国家的机器工业，就可以建成拥有五百台机器设备、年产母机两千六百五十台的新型机器厂十三个；用以扩充农业机械工业，就可以建成年产三万辆拖拉机的工厂四个半；用以发展交通事业，就可以修筑铁路三千三百五十公里，或者修成年产五万辆汽车的汽车制造厂五座；用以发展纺织工业，就可以建成拥有五万个纱锭和两千台织布机的纺织厂十五个；用以改善职工生活福利，就可以建成五百万平方公尺的住宅；如果用之于抗美援朝和国防建设，就可以购买战斗机三千三百六十八架，或大炮五千六百十四门。
    至此，高岗着重指出：实现这一光荣任务是完全可能的。首先，这个任务的提出是经过了国家计划机关和工业管理部门的周密计算；其次，下列有利条件使完成上述计划成为可能：（一）经过“三反”、“五反”运动后，工人、技术人员和职员的政治觉悟已空前提高，警惕了不法资产阶级分子向国家经济进攻的严重性，划清了工人阶级与资产阶级的界限，明确了工人阶级的地位与前途，坚定了巩固人民民主制度、并在将来胜利地走向社会主义的信心。工人的劳动积极性已大大提高，生产合理化建议比以前更为增多了。各厂矿的许多领导干部在“三反”“五反”运动中，普遍受到了教育，提高了思想，改善了作风。（二）经过“三反”运动，清洗了一批贪污盗窃分子，培养与提拔了大批新的工人和青年知识分子担任各种领导工作，从而纯洁与巩固了企业的组织，加强了厂矿的领导。
    （三）全国物价的降低，职工工资的增加，劳动保险条例又作了补充规定，都进一步改善了职工的物质生活，提高了全体职工的生产积极性。他们热爱祖国的思想已进一步加强，他们的劳动已经成为更加自觉的劳动。（四）去年增产节约运动中积累了很多经验，特别是运动中出现的大量先进经验与先进工作方法，乃是今年广泛开展增产节约运动的重要条件。有计划地推广这些经验，将会对工业生产发生伟大作用。（五）工矿企业内部仍然存在着极大的潜在力量，如设备利用率还可以提高，废品率还可以降低，产品的质量还可以改善，原材料的使用还可以节省，劳动力的浪费还可以大大减少，劳动组织及工种工序之衔接还可以大大改进。（六）有苏联专家的帮助。这些就是超计划地完成增产节约任务的胜利保证。
    高岗着重说：时间是重要的，一天也是重要的。我们应当发挥这些有利的条件，迅速地大规模地将运动开展起来。必须立即将工业战线上的领导重点转到组织生产上来，“三反”的追赃定案工作应抽出部分干部专门进行；要使大家认识开展增产节约运动的刻不容缓的意义，打破各种思想障碍，并具体解决“三反”的追赃定案工作与领导增产节约运动的矛盾。必须组织全体职工讨论今年的生产、财务、技术计划，以及基本建设任务，并制订出每个单位、小组与个人的增产节约计划。必须大力推广先进生产经验，特别是各产业中的有决定意义的先进生产经验，这是完成今年增产节约计划的关键。要使推广先进生产经验的工作，成为有领导的经常性的工作，要定期评议和实行奖励。必须注意改善劳动条件，特别对于厂房通风安全设备必须做出具体计划。应当在“三反”“五反”运动的基础上，继续加强职工的政治、文化、技术教育，在政治学习中要普遍进行关于共产主义与共产党的教育。党、行政、工会、青年团要步调一致、同心协力，共同把企业办好。企业中的政治工作，应当把与侵入工人阶级队伍的资产阶级思想作斗争的任务，和改造非工人阶级的旧的思想的任务，看成一个带根本性质的经常任务。为了负担起这样的任务，党在企业中的领导骨干，必须认真地学习马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想，并经常总结企业中的政治工作的经验，这是完成今年增产节约计划的重要保证。
    高岗最后指出：铁路、贸易、合作等部门，也应当规定一个切合实际的增产节约任务，像工业部门一样地行动起来。全东北所有机关、团体、企业都应当响应毛主席关于“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召，普遍开展一个增产节约运动，以巩固“三反”和“五反”运动的成果，增强抗美援朝的力量，并加速国家工业化的进程。各地应当大张旗鼓地宣传今年的国家计划和增产节约的重大意义，做到家喻户晓，深入人心。
