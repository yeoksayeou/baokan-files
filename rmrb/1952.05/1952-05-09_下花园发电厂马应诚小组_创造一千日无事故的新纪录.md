    The Ma Yingcheng Team of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant
    Creates a New Record of One Thousand Days Without Accidents
    Comrade Editor: The Ma Yingcheng Model Team of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant in Chahar created a new record of one thousand days without accidents by March 27th. The emergence of this brilliant achievement is not accidental. Usually, Ma Yingcheng constantly conducts patriotic education for the team members, and in every political movement, he inspires the team members, making them feel that they are the masters of the country. Based on this consciousness, the Ma Yingcheng team applied and created a set of superior working methods. Before the machines are running, they do not relax their inspection of every detail; if a fault is found during operation, it is recorded in the operation log without omission and reported to the superior. For the safe operation of the machines, they created a "seven diligence" system for checking the machines: mouth diligence, nose diligence, ear diligence, eye diligence, hand diligence, leg diligence, and brain diligence. They also established a labor organization that is divided yet united, and united yet divided. Each of them is responsible for a part of the machine, and there is a certain connection between them. This not only rationally utilizes labor but also strengthens the team members' sense of responsibility and mutual cooperation. They constantly improve their operating methods to make up for the shortcomings of the operating procedures. For example, in winter, when the weather is particularly cold and the load is light, the cooling water temperature is too low, and the circulating water pump outlet valve is closed too small, the pump pressure rises, and there is more water leakage. They installed a drain valve at the point where the circulating water enters the cooling water pond to reduce the pressure and prevent damage to the pump. Because of these improvements, they finally created a new record of one thousand days without accidents.

    下花园发电厂马应诚小组
    创造一千日无事故的新纪录
    编辑同志：察哈尔下花园发电厂马应诚模范小组，到三月二十七日止，创造了一千日无事故的新纪录。这一辉煌成绩的出现不是偶然的。平时，马应诚经常对组员进行爱国主义教育，在每个政治运动中都启发组员们，使他们感觉到自己是国家的主人翁。在这种自觉的基础上，马应诚小组运用和创造了一套优越的工作方法。他们在机器运转前不放松对每一细节的检查；运行中一发现有毛病，就毫不遗漏地记在运行日志上，并报告上级。为了机器安全运转，他们创造了嘴勤、鼻勤、耳勤、眼勤、手勤、腿勤、脑勤的“七勤”检查机器制度。他们还建立了分中有合、合中有分的劳动组织。他们每一个人都包干负责机器的一部分，彼此间又有一定的联系。这就既合理使用了劳动力，又加强了组员的责任心和互助合作。他们在操作方法上不断改进，以弥补操作规程的不足。比如在冬季天气特冷、负荷又轻的时候，因冷却水温太低，循环水泵出口截门关闭得小，水泵压力升高，漏水多。他们就在循环水进入冷却水池处装个泄水门，以减低压力，使水泵不受损失。因为以上这些改进，他们终于创造了一千日无事故的新纪录。
