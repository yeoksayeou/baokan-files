    Songjiang Yanshou County Jinhe Village Emphasizes Forest Protection and Fire Prevention
    To the Editor: Jinhe Village, Yanshou County, Songjiang Province, is located in a mountainous forest area. Over the past two years, under the leadership and education of the People's Government, the masses in the entire village have truly understood the principle of "relying on the mountains for livelihood, and nurturing the mountains." Therefore, they pay special attention to forest protection and fire prevention work. The village established a forest protection and fire prevention committee and organized a fire brigade as early as the year before last. During this spring's fire prevention period, the villagers were all mobilized. In the early morning, the militia were all dispatched to inspect the graveyards to strictly prevent fires from burning paper offerings. The village was surrounded by red and blue flags. The red flags indicated "Be careful of fire," and the blue flags indicated "No smoking or fire allowed." Women were also mobilized to stand guard and patrol, checking whether pedestrians were carrying or using fire. During this period, the village chief and the Chinese Communist Party village branch secretary repeatedly reminded everyone at every meeting to ensure that forest protection and fire prevention work was done effectively. The village chief explained the forest protection notices sent by the county People's Government in detail to the masses. Therefore, all the villagers, even the children, understood the importance of forest protection and fire prevention. The villagers themselves were also particularly careful with fire. When going outdoors, people always put out the fire first. After meetings, everyone would put out the fire before leaving. Here, forest protection and fire prevention has become a daily habit and a new morality and new atmosphere for the whole village.　Mù Jiàn

    松江延寿县金河村重视护林防火工作
    编辑同志：松江省延寿县金河村位于山林区。两年来，全村群众在人民政府的领导教育下，真正懂得了“靠山吃山、吃山养山”的道理，因此对护林防火工作格外重视。这村在前年就已成立了护林防火委员会，组织了防火队。今春防火时期，村里群众都动员起来。清晨，民兵全部出动检查坟地，严防烧纸起火。村庄周围，挂满了红旗蓝旗，红旗表示“注意防火”，蓝旗表示“严禁烟火”，并发动妇女站岗放哨，检查行人是否带火弄火。这一期间，村长和中共村支部书记在每个会上都再三提醒大家，要大家切实做好护林防火工作。县人民政府发来的护林通报，村长都详细给群众讲解。因此全村群众甚至连小孩都懂得了护林防火的重要。村里群众自己对火也特别小心，到屋外去时，人们总先把火熄了。开完会时，大家都要先把火弄熄才走。在这里，护林防火已成为群众的日常生活习惯和全村的新道德新风气了。　穆建
