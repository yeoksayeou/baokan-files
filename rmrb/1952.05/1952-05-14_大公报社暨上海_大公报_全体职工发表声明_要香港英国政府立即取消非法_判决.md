Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 11th: The staff of Ta Kung Pao and Shanghai "Ta Kung Pao" issued a statement on the 10th, protesting the Hong Kong British government's order to suspend the publication of Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" for six months and illegally sentence the newspaper's responsible personnel. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Hong Kong British government, in implementing its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, has been persecuting our residents in Hong Kong in a series of ways, expelling our film artists, and now illegally ordering the suspension of Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao for six months, undermining our news and cultural undertakings in Hong Kong. We lodge the most serious protest with the Hong Kong British government.

This time, the Hong Kong British government, under the pretext that Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post published a short commentary from the People's Daily on March 5th, "Protest Against British Imperialism's Killing of Our Residents in Hong Kong," as "seditious writing" that "violated" its so-called "Sedition Ordinance," illegally arrested ten patriotic journalists from the three newspapers, and first "tried" Ta Kung Pao personnel Fei Yimin, Li Zongying, and Bao Lichu. The "trial" was completely unreasonable and illegal. The prosecution's procedures were inconsistent, the reasons were contradictory, and the whole thing was a farce. Before the Ta Kung Pao's defense lawyers' justified and forceful defense, the British judges were embarrassed and made a mess of the ruling. They hastily finished the farce and announced a political verdict that had already been written into the British rulers' agenda: "Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao will be suspended for six months; the newspaper's owner and publisher, Fei Yimin, will be sentenced to nine months in prison or fined HK$4,000, and the newspaper's editor, Li Zongying, will be sentenced to six months in prison or fined HK$3,000."

Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao is a newspaper of the Chinese people and a newspaper published in Hong Kong by Ta Kung Pao Co., Ltd. When the news of its forced suspension came, all the staff of our Shanghai Ta Kung Pao were extremely indignant and completely intolerable of this act of violence by the Hong Kong British government. Many of our colleagues have worked in Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao and know that the so-called "freedom of the press" under British imperialism is the freedom to lie; we also know that Hong Kong has long been one of the world's most famous rumor mills. Since the Hong Kong British government promulgated its "Enrichment of News Control Ordinance," we have expected that the government was prepared to strangle the Chinese people's news undertakings in Hong Kong. But we will never be intimidated by their conspiracies and atrocities, and we will continue to stand fast, be loyal to our motherland, report the truth to the Chinese people in Hong Kong, and fight for truth and freedom to the end.

Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong British government chose the topic of publishing a short commentary from the People's Daily to persecute Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao. The People's Daily is a newspaper that speaks on behalf of all the Chinese people. Although this short commentary was only over six hundred words long, it should be known that it represents 500 million Chinese people's angry protest against British imperialism and represents the great Chinese people's condolences and support for the Chinese people who are being persecuted in Hong Kong. As a newspaper of the Chinese people, it is its sacred duty to publish this short commentary. It is our legitimate right to publish this short commentary in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post did the right thing, and doing so is patriotic. Patriotism is the most sacred. The Hong Kong British government slandered the People's Daily short commentary as "seditious writing," so the three newspapers "violated" the "Sedition Ordinance" and had to face "official lawsuits." It should be known that the Hong Kong British government's lawsuit against this short commentary is a lawsuit against 500 million Chinese people and a serious hostile provocation against the People's Republic of China. Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao conveyed the voice of the great motherland and the strong will of the Chinese people; it is glorious to fight for the basic freedoms and rights of our Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, and we will spare no sacrifice.

Now that the Chinese people have a strong motherland, no matter where they live, whether in Hong Kong or anywhere else, they will not allow imperialism to trample on them as they did in the past. The forced suspension of Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, the arrest and trial of patriotic journalists, and the imposition of imprisonment or fines can only arouse greater hatred among the Chinese people towards British imperialism. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China has formally lodged a serious protest, and we fully support this protest. The China Ta Kung Pao demands that the Hong Kong British government immediately rescind the illegal "verdict," restore the publication of Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, return the forcibly extorted so-called "fines" and "court fees," and compensate for all the losses incurred as a result.

All the staff of Shanghai Ta Kung Pao pledge to be the backing of Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao and to fight British imperialism to the end.

    大公报社暨上海“大公报”全体职工发表声明
    要香港英国政府立即取消非法“判决”
    【新华社上海十一日电】大公报社暨上海“大公报”全体职工十日发表声明，抗议香港英国政府勒令香港“大公报”停刊六个月并对该报负责人非法判刑。声明全文如下：
    香港英国政府执行敌视中国人民的政策，一系列地迫害香港的我国居民，驱逐我国电影艺术工作者，现在又非法命令香港大公报停刊六个月，摧残我国在香港的新闻文化事业。我们向香港英国政府提出最严重的抗议。
    这次香港英国政府藉口香港大公报、文汇报、新晚报在三月五日刊载北京人民日报短评“抗议英帝国主义捕杀香港的我国居民”为“煽动性文字”，
    “触犯”了其所谓“煽动条例”，非法逮捕三报十名爱国的新闻工作者，并首先“审讯”大公报人员费彝民、李宗瀛、鲍立初。“审讯”完全是无理的，非法的。律政司的起诉手续不合，理由背谬，笑话百出。在大公报辩护律师理直气壮的辩护之前，那些英国法官们弄得狼狈不堪，胡乱裁定。他们草草演完了笑剧，便以蛮横态度宣布早已在英国统治者日程上写好的政治性的判决：“香港大公报停刊六个月；该报所有人兼督印人费彝民徒刑九个月或罚款港币四千元，该报编辑李宗瀛徒刑六个月或罚款港币三千元。”
    香港大公报是中国人民的报纸，是大公报股份有限公司在香港发行的一张报纸。当他被迫停刊的消息传来时，我们上海大公报全体职工万分愤慨，对香港英国政府这种暴行完全不能容忍。我们有许多同人曾在香港大公报做过工作，深知英帝国主义统治下的所谓“新闻自由”就是说谎自由；我们也知道香港早已成为世界闻名的谣言制造厂之一。自香港英国政府颁布其“充实新闻管制条例”以来，我们就料到该政府已准备缢杀中国人民在香港的新闻事业。但是我们绝不为其阴谋暴行所慑服，仍坚持岗位，尽忠祖国，对香港的中国人民报道真实情况，为真理与自由奋斗到底。
    想不到香港英国政府迫害香港大公报竟选择了刊载人民日报短评这个题目。人民日报是代表全中国人民说话的报纸，这个短评虽仅有六百余字，须知它代表着五万万中国人民向英帝国主义愤怒抗议，代表着伟大的中国人民对在香港被迫害的中国人民表示慰问与支援。作为中国人民的报纸，刊登这个短评是它神圣的责任。在香港刊出这个短评乃是我们正当的权利。香港大公报、文汇报、新晚报做得完全正确，这样做是爱国的。爱国是最神圣的。香港英国政府诬蔑人民日报短评为“煽动的文字”，因此三报都“触犯”了“煽动条例”，而吃“官司”。须知香港英国政府和这个短评打“官司”，就是和五万万中国人民打官司，就是对中华人民共和国严重的敌对挑衅行为。香港大公报传达了伟大祖国的声音，传达了中国人民坚强的意志；为争取香港中国同胞的基本自由与权利而斗争，这任务是光荣的，我们是不惜任何牺牲的。
    现在中国人民已有强大的祖国，不管居住香港或任何地方，都不容许帝国主义像过去那样对他们随便蹂躏了。香港大公报被迫停刊，爱国的新闻工作者被捕受审，被处徒刑或罚款；这只能引起中国人民对英帝国主义更大的仇恨，我中华人民共和国外交部已正式提出严重抗议，我们完全拥护这个抗议。中国大公报社要求香港英国政府：立即取消非法的“判决”，恢复香港大公报的刊行，退还强制勒索的所谓“罚款”、“堂费”，并赔偿因此所受的一切损失。
    上海大公报全体职工同人誓作香港大公报的后盾，与英帝国主义周旋到底。
