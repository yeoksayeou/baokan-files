    Hebei Jixi Desert Afforestation Bureau
    Holds Forestry Traveling Exhibition, Welcomed by the Masses

    Editor: This spring, the Jixi Desert Afforestation Bureau of Hebei Province adopted the method of traveling exhibitions to promote the benefits of forest protection and fire prevention, closing hillsides for afforestation, and desert afforestation. It was well received by the masses. The Afforestation Bureau used local market fairs and temple fairs to hold traveling exhibitions, and held 18 exhibitions in five counties, including Zhengding and Gaocheng. More than 58,000 farmers, workers, students, and cadres visited the exhibitions. The exhibits included pictures, specimens, and objects. In particular, the pictures played the biggest role. The audience truly recognized from the pictures that forests are the wealth of the country; forests can not only supply the needs of national construction, but also maintain water, regulate the climate, and directly protect farmland and grassland. Many viewers said after seeing the Soviet forestry construction displayed in the pictures: "They have so many forests and still continue to plant trees, we should plant more!" Some farmers saw the portraits and deeds of national forestry labor model Jia Lanhua and Hebei provincial forestry labor model Sun Luoyong, as well as many photos about seed collection, seedling raising, and afforestation, and happily said: "We must learn more from Jia Lanhua and Sun Luoyong!" The audience also understood from the pictures that forest protection is as important as afforestation.
    We believe that traveling exhibitions are an effective form of propaganda, and can be used not only for forestry work, but also for other work. We recommend that all regions try it.

    河北冀西沙荒造林局
    举办林业巡回展览会受到群众欢迎
    编辑同志：河北冀西沙荒造林局今年春天采用巡回展览的办法，宣传护林防火、封山育林、沙荒造林的好处，很受群众欢迎。造林局利用各地集市庙会举行巡回展览，先后在正定、藁城等五县举办十八次，前往参观的农民、工人、学生、干部达五万八千多人。展览品有图片、标本、实物。特别是图片起的作用最大。观众从图片上真正认识了森林是国家的财富；森林不但可以供给国家建设需要，而且能够保持水分、调节气候，直接保护农田与草原。许多观众看到图片上展示的苏联林业建设后说：“人家有那么多森林还要不断造林，咱们可得多造些哩！”有些农民看到全国林业劳动模范贾兰虎和河北省林业劳动模范孙洛勇的像片和事迹，以及许多关于采种、育苗、造林的照片后，高兴地说：“咱们可得多多学习贾兰虎和孙洛勇呢！”观众从图片上也明白了护林与造林一样重要的道理。
    我们认为巡回展览会是一个有效的宣传方式，它不仅可用于林业工作，也可用于其他工作，特建议各地试用。
