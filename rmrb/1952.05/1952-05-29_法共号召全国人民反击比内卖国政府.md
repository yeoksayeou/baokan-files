Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 28th: The French Communist Party issued a statement saying: On May 26th, the Binet government signed the war treaty in Bonn that formally turned West Germany into a base for aggression; on the 27th, Li Qiewei, the spreader of war and plague, arrived in Paris. The French people have held many demonstrations in Paris and various provinces to oppose Li Qiewei's visit to France; now, the men and women of Paris have decided to respond to the call of the Seine Province Peace Committee on the 28th to participate in the protest demonstration. All over France, people are shouting: "Li Qiewei, get out!"

The government knows that the French men and women will never submit to the rule of the American occupiers. The people oppose the war and traitorous policies, and the scale of this resistance movement has shocked the government, which continues to illegally arrest peace advocates. On the morning of the 25th, Stie, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and editor-in-chief of "L'Humanité," was arrested.

We should quickly give a powerful counterattack to the government's actions. The masses of the people know that their efforts have freed some political prisoners, and they will certainly be able to restore the freedom of Stie and all imprisoned patriots. The Communist Party calls on all French people to do their best to prepare for resistance. The Communist Party stipulates that all party members immediately convene group meetings to discuss how to take action and form the broadest alliance with all working people—Socialists, Catholics, all democrats and patriots. The Communist Party calls on all working people to prepare for demonstrations in various enterprises, while collecting signatures for petitions, delivering speeches, sending delegations, organizing strikes, and establishing peace committees everywhere. The Communist Party calls on all residents to act in the same spirit in various residential areas and villages.

The French people must use these actions to answer the warmongers, making it impossible for the government to continue to implement its policies of creating war, poverty, and fascism. The fact that the French people do not allow Li Qiewei to gain a foothold in Paris shows their determination to defend peace. They advocate: abolishing the Atlantic Pact and its subordinate treaties, peacefully resolving the German question in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, striving for peace in Vietnam and Korea, concluding a peace pact among the five major powers to pave the way for universal disarmament, and establishing a government that maintains peace and national independence.

    法共号召全国人民反击比内卖国政府
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党发表声明说：五月二十六日，比内政府在波恩签订把西德正式变成侵略基地的战争条约；二十七日，战争和瘟疫的传播者李奇微又到达巴黎。法国人民在巴黎和各省都举行了许多次示威游行，反对李奇微来法国；现在，巴黎的男女又决定在二十八日响应塞纳省和平委员会的号召，参加抗议示威。法国全国各地都在高呼：“李奇微滚出去！”
    政府知道：法国男女绝不肯听从美国占领者的管辖。人民反对战争和卖国政策，这个反抗运动的规模使得政府非常震惊，政府就不断地非法逮捕和平拥护者。二十五日晨，法国共产党中央委员会委员、“人道报”总编辑斯梯被捕。
    我们应当迅速予政府的这种行动以有力的反击。人民群众知道：他们的努力曾经使一些政治犯获得自由，他们也一定可以使斯梯和所有被监禁的爱国者恢复自由。共产党号召全体法国人尽力准备反抗。共产党规定全体党员立即召开小组会，讨论怎样采取行动，和全体劳动人民——社会党人、天主教党人，一切民主分子和爱国人士结成最广泛的联盟。共产党号召所有的劳动人民在各企业中准备举行示威，同时为请愿书徵集签名，发表演说，派遣代表团，组织罢工，并且在各处建立和平委员会。共产党号召所有居民在各居民区和各乡村以同样精神行动起来。
    法国人要用这些行动来回答战争贩子，使政府不可能继续执行制造战争、穷困与法西斯主义的政策。法国人民不让李奇微在巴黎立足，这就表示了他们保卫和平的意志。他们主张：废除大西洋公约及其附属性条约，根据波茨坦协定和平解决德国问题，争取越南和朝鲜的和平，缔结五大国和平公约以开拓普遍裁减军备的道路，建立维护和平与民族独立的政府。
