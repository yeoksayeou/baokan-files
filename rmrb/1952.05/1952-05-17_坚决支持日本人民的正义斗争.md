　　Resolutely Support the Just Struggle of the Japanese People

　　The Japanese people are waging a heroic and just struggle for national independence and democratic freedom. In particular, they held massive demonstrations on a national scale on May Day this year. Since then, the struggle of the Japanese people has unfolded in a new situation, causing panic and unease among the US and Japanese reactionaries.

　　In order to suppress the resistance of the Japanese people, the US and Japanese reactionaries not only created the "May Day" bloody tragedy, but also, after the "May Day" tragedy, intensified their atrocities and continued their frenzied attacks on the Japanese people. Recently, with the support of the US military, the Yoshida reactionary government's police have been arresting Japanese patriots on a large scale throughout the country. According to Japanese official sources, as of the evening of the 10th, the number of people arrested had reached 618, and it is expected that the number of those arrested will exceed 1,000 in the future. On the 8th, the Japanese reactionary government, deliberately seeking trouble, sent 500 police officers, armed with weapons, to break into Waseda University in Tokyo, unreasonably injuring 107 students.

　　At the same time, the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Law," which has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people, will be submitted to the Senate for "review" this weekend. This means that the Yoshida reactionary government is also attempting to create a legal basis for its brutal fascist actions.

　　The "May Day" tragedy and the continued expansion of atrocities by the US and Japanese reactionaries demonstrate that when their conspiracy to intensify the enslavement of the Japanese people is resolutely opposed by the Japanese people, and when their political tricks are bankrupt, they completely expose their hideous faces and jackal nature, proving that they are the mortal enemies of the Japanese people, and proving that the "independence" and "democracy" of Japan, touted by the US and Japanese reactionaries, are nothing but a complete lie. People have seen that only a few days after the so-called "peace treaty" with Japan came into effect, the US military directed and directly participated in the terror and arrest of the Japanese people. Does this not prove that Japan's "independence" means that American soldiers can arbitrarily slaughter the Japanese people, and that Japan's so-called "democracy" means that the Japanese people's right to survival is not guaranteed at all?

　　However, the "May Day" tragedy and the recent new atrocities manufactured by the US and Japanese reactionaries will absolutely not frighten the heroic Japanese people, who are becoming increasingly united. As the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out in its letter to Japanese workers and people after the "May Day" tragedy, the frenzied persecution of the Japanese people by the US and Japanese reactionaries "will inevitably further sharpen the national liberation struggle." The Japanese Communist Party has issued a statement calling on the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the Yoshida government. The left and right wings of the Japan Socialist Party also unanimously believe that the Yoshida government should be held responsible for the "May Day" tragedy and demand the resignation of the Yoshida cabinet. The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions called on Japanese workers to hold a general strike, and the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations called on Japanese students to hold a general strike to express their protest. Recently, the leading organs of the Japanese Communist Party also issued a letter to the people of the world, calling on the people of the world to help the persecuted Japanese people and to send an international investigation team to Tokyo. The Japanese people's struggle against persecution is developing.

　　The Chinese people firmly support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people and strongly protest against the bloody atrocities of the US and Japanese reactionaries, and protest against the illegal mass arrest of Japanese patriots by the Yoshida government. The Chinese people believe that the US military and the Japanese Yoshida government must be fully responsible for the "May Day" tragedy and must receive due punishment.

### 坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争

    坚决支持日本人民的正义斗争
    日本人民为了争取民族独立和民主自由，正进行着英勇的正义的斗争。特别是在今年五一劳动节举行了全国规模的声势浩大的示威。以后，日本人民的斗争展开了一个新的形势，使美、日反动派恐慌不安。
    为要镇压日本人民的反抗，美、日反动派不但制造了“五一”流血惨案，而且在“五一”惨案之后，更加变本加厉地扩大他们的暴行，继续向日本人民疯狂进攻。最近，在美军的支持下，吉田反动政府的警察正在全国各地大肆逮捕日本爱国人士。据日本官方承认，截至十日晚为止，被捕人数已达六百一十八名，预计今后被捕者将超过一千名。八日，蓄意寻衅的日本反动政府派出警察五百名，手执凶器，闯入东京早稻田大学，无理殴伤学生一百零七人。
    同时，遭到日本人民强烈反对的所谓“防止破坏活动法案”，本周末将被提交参议院“审查”。这就是说，吉田反动政府还企图给它的残暴的法西斯行径制造法律根据。
    “五一”惨案及美日反动派继续扩大暴行的种种事实说明，当他们企图加紧奴役日本人民的阴谋遭到日本人民的坚决反对的时候，当他们的政治诡计陷于破产的时候，他们就完全暴露出自己的狰狞面孔和豺狼本色，证明他们是日本人民的死敌，证明了美、日反动派所喧嚷的日本已获得“独立”和“民主”，乃是一个弥天大谎。人们都看到，在所谓对日“和约”生效之后仅仅几天，美军就指挥了和直接参加了对日本人民的恐怖镇压和逮捕行动。这难道不就证明了日本的“独立”就是美国兵可以任意屠杀日本人民，而所谓日本的“民主”就是使日本人民的生存权利毫无保障吗？
    然而美、日反动派所制造的“五一”惨案和最近的新暴行，绝对吓不倒团结得日益坚强的英勇的日本人民。正如日本共产党中央指导部在“五一”惨案后发表的告日本工人和人民书所指出的，美日反动派对日本人民的疯狂迫害，“势必使民族解放斗争进一步尖锐化”。日本共产党已发表声明，号召日本人民起来打倒吉田政府。日本社会党左派和右派也一致认为吉田政府应对“五一”惨案负责，要求吉田内阁辞职。全日本产业别工会会议号召日本工人举行总罢工，全日本学生自治会联合会号召日本学生举行总罢课，表示抗议。最近，日本共产党领导机关又发表了告世界人民书，号召世界人民援助遭受迫害的日本人民，并派遣国际调查团赴东京。日本人民这一反迫害的斗争正在发展中。
    中国人民坚决支持日本人民的英勇斗争，并严重抗议美日反动派的血腥暴行，抗议吉田政府对日本爱国人士的非法大逮捕。中国人民认为，美国军队和日本吉田政府必须对“五一”惨案完全负责，并必须受到应得的惩罚。
