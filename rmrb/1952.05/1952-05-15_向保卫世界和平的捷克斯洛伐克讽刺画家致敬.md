    A Salute to Czechoslovak Cartoonists Defending World Peace
    Cai Ruohong
    The Czechoslovak political cartoon exhibition which opened on May 8th at the Waterside Pavilion in Zhongshan Park, Beijing, gave us a very deep impression. A work entitled "Art Struggles for Peace" generally reflects the determination of Czechoslovak artists to defend peace. Its content is a group of artists using their art tools and works to block the muzzles of the warmongers. This is a cartoon with a clear theme. The working goals of Czechoslovak artists and the fighting role that art should play in the great cause of defending peace are prominently displayed here. It is under this sacred mission that Czechoslovak cartoonists wield their pens.
    In the forty-five works at the exhibition, we saw how the painters concentrated their efforts, pointing their pens at those war instigators who were preparing to turn the world into a slaughterhouse, and specifically exposing the heinous conspiracies and despicable actions of the bloodthirsty. Look: the octopus of the "Atlantic Group" shows how the group of victims captured by the tentacles of the American octopus is struggling in increasingly profound contradictions; "Separate Peace Treaty with Japan" illustrates that the private "peace treaty" between Truman and the Yoshida government is actually evidence of a vain attempt to expand the war of aggression. "American Perfume Shop Selling Bacteria" powerfully exposes the crimes of American bacteriological warfare criminals, who attempted to use this "American perfume" to save their defeat, but did not dare to admit this sinful deal. After Lieutenant Enok and Lieutenant Quinn, captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers, revealed their secrets, they still denied it. "American fairy tales" also keep appearing, but Truman's lying skills are no better than Hitler's. He used to be full of "democracy," but now he is full of "humanity." Who doesn't know that this "democracy" is a pseudonym for tyranny, and this "humanity" is downright inhumanity.
    Czechoslovak cartoonists not only exposed the true colors of the warmongers, but also pointed out the failed future and inevitable demise of these man-eating barbarians. Works such as "News from the Korean War," "Kaesong Negotiations," and "Truman's Harvest in Korea" all depict the ugly state of the American aggressors in their constant state of panic from various perspectives. Especially in the work "After Comrade Stalin Answered the Pravda Reporter's Question About the Atomic Bomb," the author vividly portrayed the panic of those clowns jumping in the sun of truth. This is an important reflection of that historical event in the art of caricature.
    This is the first time that Czechoslovak cartoons have been exhibited in China. This exhibition greatly helps the artistic exchange between China and Czechoslovakia and strengthens the deep friendship and common will of the people of China and Czechoslovakia. The strong will and firm confidence of Czechoslovak artists in defending peace is also the common will and confidence of all peace-loving artists in the world. The valuable creative achievements of Czechoslovak artists, as shown in this exhibition, are the common glory of progressive artists in all countries. We salute the Czechoslovak cartoonists!

    向保卫世界和平的捷克斯洛伐克讽刺画家致敬
    蔡若虹
    五月八日在北京中山公园水榭开幕的捷克斯洛伐克政治讽刺画展览会，给了我们非常深刻的印象。一幅题为“艺术为和平而斗争”的作品，概括地反映了捷克斯洛伐克艺术工作者保卫和平的决心。它的内容是一群艺术工作者将他们的艺术工具和作品堵塞住战争贩子们的炮口，这是一幅主题鲜明的漫画。捷克斯洛伐克艺术工作者的工作目标和艺术在保卫和平的伟大事业中应起的战斗作用，都在这里突出地表现出来了。捷克斯洛伐克的讽刺画家们就是在这一神圣任务下挥舞他们的画笔的。
    在展览会上的四十五幅作品中，我们看到画家们是怎样集中力量，把笔尖指向那些准备把世界当作屠场的战争挑拨者的身上，把嗜血者的罪恶阴谋和卑鄙行动具体地揭露出来。看：“大西洋集团”的章鱼，表现了被美国章鱼的触脚所俘获的牺牲品集团，怎样在日益深刻化的矛盾中挣扎着；“单独对日和约”说明了杜鲁门和吉田政府的私人“和约”实际上是妄图扩大侵略战争的罪证。“贩卖细菌的美国香水店”有力地揭露了美国细菌战犯们的罪行，他们企图用这种“美国香水”来挽救自己的溃败，但又不敢承认这一罪恶勾当。中国人民志愿军所俘获的伊纳克中尉和奎恩中尉把他们的老底子揭露出来以后，他们仍然抵赖。“美国的童话”也源源出现了，然而，杜鲁门的撒谎技术并不比希特勒高明。他过去满口“民主”，现在又满口“人道”。谁不知道：这种“民主”是暴政的别名，这种“人道”正是道道地地的惨无人道。
    捷克斯洛伐克的讽刺画家们不仅揭露了战争贩子们的原形，而且指出了这些吃人生番的失败前途和必然灭亡的命运。“朝鲜战讯”“开城谈判”和“杜鲁门在朝鲜的收获”等等作品，都在各个不同的角度上画出了美国侵略者惶惶不可终日的丑态。尤其是在“斯大林同志答复真理报记者关于原子弹的问话以后”这幅作品中，作者把那些在真理的太阳照射下的跳梁小丑的惊惶失措，表现得淋漓尽致。这是讽刺画艺术对于那个历史性事件的重要反映。
    捷克斯洛伐克讽刺画在中国的展出，这还是第一次。这个展览会大大有助于中捷两国艺术的交流和中捷两国人民的深厚友谊和共同意志的加强。捷克斯洛伐克艺术家们保卫和平的坚强意志和坚定信心，也是全世界一切爱好和平的艺术家们的共同意志和信心。捷克斯洛伐克艺术家们的宝贵的创作收获，如这个展览会所显示的，乃是各国进步艺术工作者的共同光荣。我们向捷克斯洛伐克的讽刺画家们致敬！
