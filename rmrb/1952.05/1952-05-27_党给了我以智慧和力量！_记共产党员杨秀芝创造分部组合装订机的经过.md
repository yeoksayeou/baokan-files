    "The Party Gave Me Wisdom and Strength!"
    — On the Communist Party Member Yang Xiuzhi's Creation of the Sectional Combined Binding Machine
    He Cun
    Communist Party member Yang Xiuzhi is a binding worker at the Printing Factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region. From the age of fifteen, he suffered the abuse and exploitation of landlords and the humiliation of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In a painful life of unemployment, hunger, cold, and beatings, he was almost reduced to a fool. In 1945, the liberation of Zhangjiakou ended his days of suffering. Through the cultivation and education of the Party, he established a firm communist worldview, and later became a glorious Communist Party member.
    During the labor emulation campaign in 1949, Yang Xiuzhi realized that every Communist Party member had a glorious responsibility in the construction of the new China, and he resolved to try to replace manual binding with machines. From then on, the idea of creating a binding machine flickered in his mind.
    In October 1950, the factory's new record competition campaign was launched. Party Secretary Jiang Ping told everyone at the Party and Youth League members' meeting: in this new record movement, we must thoroughly correct the erroneous practice of simply relying on overtime and physical strength. Everyone should use their brains, find tricks, improve tools, improve labor organization, and improve work efficiency. This gave Yang Xiuzhi great encouragement, and the idea of ​​making a binding machine floated in his mind again. However, he thought: "I am an ordinary worker, I have not attended school, I do not understand mechanical principles, and relying only on some binding experience, can I succeed in creating such a complex machine?" He also thought that as a Communist Party member, he should not be afraid of any difficulties.
    From then on, he conducted research on his own during his evening rest time. He worked almost every day until three or four o'clock in the morning before going to bed. Sometimes when he encountered something he couldn't figure out, he would think about it all night long. When he was too tired to support himself, he would doze off at his desk. In this way, he conducted precise research on the thirteen manual operation processes from collating to cutting, forming patterns of the style of each work process in his mind, then writing down the shapes and actions of the machines he had thought of with symbols (he couldn't draw engineering drawings), and finally trying to connect the various parts to complete the design preliminarily.
    Although he had made a preliminary plan, he did not have the courage to take it out. The Party leaders of the factory discovered his plan, personally talked with him several times, carefully examined his plan, and encouraged him to study hard the experiences of industrial labor models in creation and invention, to learn their spirit of research and perseverance in overcoming difficulties, and to realize his wishes.
    From then on, Yang Xiuzhi's work of manufacturing the binding machine was carried out under the correct leadership and active support of the Party, so the problems encountered in the work were easily solved. Considering that he couldn't draw, the Party committee specially found a carpenter who could draw to help him draw pictures and make models, and organized technicians from the iron workshop to discuss the structural principles of the binding machine, and help him solve the problems in parts allocation. In addition, the Party committee also assigned three branch committee members to take care of him regularly. The factory management committee also allowed Yang Xiuzhi to leave production and specialize in making models; and allocated three million yuan as his experimental fee (actually spent ten million yuan).
    The Party's meticulous care and help made Yang Xiuzhi realize more deeply that Zhao Guoyou's words were completely correct: "Use your brain, think of ways, make up your mind, get rid of all worries, and dare to do it, you will always achieve results; but without the leadership and help of the Party, you will achieve nothing." These words became the foundation of his work.
    Yang Xiuzhi's mind became more focused. He paid attention to the role of various machines everywhere to help his work. Once he saw a pump used to repair ditches drawing water out of the ditch on the street, he thought: could suction be used to suck up the folded pages and match them together? So he bought a ball, divided the ball into two halves, and experimented by pressing it with his hands, and the results proved that his idea was possible. A few days later, he went to the clinic to see a doctor and saw a rubber tube placed on the hospital bed. He picked it up and used his mouth to suck the newspaper on the table. Before the rubber tube was close to the newspaper, the newspaper was sucked up. In this way, he was sure that the method of using suction to collate pages was feasible. When watching the weapons exhibition, he discovered that the principle of the tank track's cyclical rotation could be used to solve the problem of page collation.
    In this way, the first machine model was finally manufactured in January 1951. This immediately attracted the attention of printing workers and the government. On July 25, 1951, according to the opinion of the General Administration of Press, the factory Party committee organized experts, veteran workers, and staff from the printing industry to hold a symposium to discuss the binding machine created by Yang Xiuzhi. Yang Xiuzhi humbly listened to everyone's opinions at the meeting and prepared to further transform the binding machine model.
    However, the Central Bureau of Technology Administration did not initially take a positive attitude towards Yang Xiuzhi's new creation. Later, after criticism from the People's Daily reader's letters column, it gradually changed, but individual personnel still did not pay much attention to Yang Xiuzhi's creation. For example, when Liu Shangnie of the Central Bureau of Technical Administration went to Shanghai with Yang Xiuzhi to visit, Yang Xiuzhi listened to the opinions of the veteran technical workers in Shanghai and prepared to change the plan and redesign it, but Liu Shangnie took the opportunity to pour cold water on Yang Xiuzhi. He said, "The previous model has already cost more than 10 million yuan, and there is no result; if you make another one, I don't know how much more money the country will waste. I hope you use your time to make some small and easy-to-make machines. I heard that the United States has binding machines, it is better to imitate the American ones, which is more convenient." However, this did not make Yang Xiuzhi discouraged. He continued to study the principle of using suction to collate pages, and also experimented with using multiple combined units instead of the track page walking method. In the meantime, the Party Secretary encouraged him to use the greatest courage to persevere in his work to the end, and not to bow his head in the face of difficulties.
    During the intense "Three-Anti" movement, when the entire factory's Party, government, labor union, and youth league were focusing on "tiger fighting," the Party Committee did not relax its guidance and care for Yang Xiuzhi's creative work. In addition to regularly giving him inspiration and encouragement, the Party Committee and the factory management committee decided to let Yang Xiuzhi leave production and specialize in research to complete the manufacturing of the machine model. After three months of painstaking research, the sectional combined binding machine created by Yang Xiuzhi was finally successful.
    When Yang Xiuzhi's binding machine, which could replace the labor of two hundred people, started to run, it was difficult to describe people's excitement.
    When Yang Xiuzhi talked about the source of his creativity, he repeatedly said: "The Party gave me wisdom and strength!"

    “党给了我以智慧和力量！”
    ——记共产党员杨秀芝创造分部组合装订机的经过
    禾村
    共产党员杨秀芝，是华北军区政治部印刷厂的装订工人。他从十五岁起，就受着地主的虐待和剥削，受着日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的百般凌辱。在失业、挨饿、受冻、挨打的痛苦生活中，他几乎变成了傻子。一九四五年，张家口解放，结束了他的苦难日子。经过党的培养和教育，他树立了坚强的共产主义的人生观，以后，他成为光荣的共产党员。
    在一九四九年的劳动竞赛运动中，杨秀芝认识到在新中国建设中每个共产党员都有光荣的职责，他下决心试图用机器代替手工装订。从此，他脑子里就闪烁着创造装订机的思想。
    一九五○年十月，全厂的新纪录竞赛运动展开了。党委书记江萍在党团员大会上告诉大家：在这次新纪录运动当中，要彻底纠正加班加点单纯体力比赛的错误作法。大家要动脑筋，找窍门，改良工具，改进劳动组织，提高工作效率。这给了杨秀芝以很大的鼓舞，制造装订机的念头，又在他的脑子里浮动起来。但是，他想：“我是一个普通工人，没有上过什么学，不懂机械原理，单凭一些装订经验，要创造这么一部构造复杂的机器，能够成功吗？”又想，自己是个共产党员，不应该畏惧任何困难。
    从此，他在晚上的休息时间，就独自进行研究。差不多每天都要搞到深夜三、四点钟才睡。有时候碰到想不通的地方，就彻夜地想下去。到了疲困得不能支持的时候，就伏在桌子上打盹。这样，他把从配页到裁段的十三个手工操作过程，分别作了精密的研究，把每一个工作过程的样式在脑子里构成图案，然后把想好了的机器形状和动作用记号写下来（他不会画工程图），最后把各个部分设法联系起来，初步地完成了设计。
    他虽然把初步计划作了出来，却没有勇气把它拿出去。工厂党的领导同志发现了他的计划，亲自同他谈了几次话，仔细审查了他的计划，鼓励他好好地学习工业劳动模范创造发明的经验，学习他们的钻研精神和克服困难的毅力，实现自己的愿望。
    从这以后，杨秀芝制造装订机的工作全是在党的正确领导和积极支持之下进行的，因而工作上所遇到的问题也都很容易地得到了解决。考虑到他不会画图，党委专门找了一位会制图的木工帮助他画图、作模型，又组织铁工部的技工讨论了装订机的构造原理，帮助他解决零件配制方面的问题。此外，党委还指定了三个支部委员经常地关照他。工厂管理委员会也让杨秀芝脱离生产，专门制造模型；并拨款三百万元作为他的试验费（实际花了一千万元）。
    党的无微不至的爱护和帮助，使杨秀芝更深刻地认识到赵国有的话是完全正确的：“用脑子，想办法，下定决心，去掉一切顾虑，大胆去干，总会干出成绩来；但是没有党的领导和帮助，会一无所成。”这些话也就成了他的工作的基础。
    杨秀芝的思想更加专一了。他处处留心各种机器的作用，以帮助自己的工作。有一次他在大街上看到修水沟用的唧筒正从沟里往外抽水，他想：是不是可以用吸力把摺好的页子吸起来配在一起呢？于是他买了一个皮球，把皮球分成两半，用手按来按去地试验，结果证明自己的设想是可能的。隔了几天，他到卫生所去看病，看到病床上放着一个胶皮管，他就拿起来用嘴吸桌上的报纸，胶皮管还没有挨近报纸，报纸就被吸起来了。这样他就肯定了用吸力配页的办法是行得通的。在看兵器展览的时候，他发现坦克履带循环转动的原理是可以用来解决配页问题的。
    这样，第一部机器模型终于在一九五一年一月制造成功了。这马上引起了印刷工人和政府的注意。一九五一年七月二十五日，按照新闻总署的意见，工厂党委组织印刷界的专家、老工人和工作人员举行了座谈会，讨论了杨秀芝所创造的装订机。杨秀芝在会上虚心地听取了大家的意见，准备进一步改造装订机模型。
    但是，对于杨秀芝的这一新的创造，中央技术管理局在开始并没有采取积极赞助的态度，后来，经过人民日报读者来信栏的批评，才逐渐有了改变，但个别人员对杨秀芝的创造仍然是很不重视的。例如中央技术管理局刘尚臬同杨秀芝去上海参观的时候，杨秀芝听取了上海老技术工人的意见准备改变计划，重新设计时，刘尚臬却乘机给杨秀芝泼冷水。说什么“前一部模型已经花了一千多万元，没有什么结果；如果你再另改做一部，不知还得给国家浪费多少钱。我希望你利用自己的时间搞些小的容易搞的机器。听说美国有装订机，不如仿造美国的省事”。但是，这没有使杨秀芝灰心丧气。他继续研究用吸气配页的原理，又试验了用多台组合的方法代替了履带走页的方法。在这中间，党委书记鼓励他用最大的勇气把自己的工作坚持到底，不要在困难面前低头。
    在紧张的“三反”运动中，在全厂党政工团都集中火力忙于“打虎”工作的时候，党委也没有放松对杨秀芝创造工作的指导和关怀。除了经常给他以启发和鼓励以外，党委和工厂管理委员会并决定杨秀芝脱离生产，专门进行研究，以完成机器模型的制造。经过三个月的苦心钻研，杨秀芝所创造的分部组合装订机，终于成功了。
    当杨秀芝的能够代替二百个人劳动的装订机转动起来的时候，人们的兴奋心情是很难描述的。
    在杨秀芝谈到他的创造力的源泉时，他重复地说着：“党给了我以智慧和力量！”
