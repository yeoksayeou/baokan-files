    "Hebei Education" Should Not Neglect Introducing the "Accelerated Literacy Method"
    The "Accelerated Literacy Method" created by Comrade Qi Jianhua is a good method for eliminating illiteracy at present. Newspapers and periodicals in various places have introduced this method to the broad masses of people with great effort, but "Hebei Education" has not made any introduction to it. I think this is very wrong. This shows that the editorial department of "Hebei Education" is indifferent to the creations of the masses and lacks enthusiasm for promoting the study of worker-peasant culture. I hope the editorial department of "Hebei Education" will quickly pay attention and correct this. Zhang Chifeng

### “河北教育”不应忽视对“速成识字法”的介绍

    “河北教育”不应忽视对“速成识字法”的介绍
    祁建华同志创造的“速成识字法”，是目前消除文盲的良好方法。各地报刊都以很大的力量向广大人民介绍了这个方法，但“河北教育”却一直没有作任何介绍。我认为这是非常错误的。这说明“河北教育”的编辑部是漠视群众创造的，对于推动工农文化的学习是缺乏热情的。希望“河北教育”编辑部迅速注意纠正。    张迟逢
