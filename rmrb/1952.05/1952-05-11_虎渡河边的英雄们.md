    In the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Construction Site
    Editor's Note: The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, which is currently underway, is one of the great water conservancy construction projects of New China. It will eliminate the floods that have frequently plagued the area for nearly four hundred years and transform the banks into fertile farmland. These two reports were originally published in "Yangtze River Literature" issue 40, and partially reflect the enthusiastic labor of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, civilian workers, and machinery factory workers participating in this project.
    We hope that literary and art workers will delve deeply into life and go to the various production and construction fronts of the motherland to reflect the struggle life of the people.
    Heroes by the Hudukou River
    Wu Hai
    The east is just beginning to brighten, the sky is still gray, and the military and civilian workers on both sides of the Hudukou River are all active! Carrying baskets and hoes, on this land where the morning breeze sends the fragrance of rapeseed flowers everywhere, the crowd flows mightily. Like soldiers carrying weapons, they head to the battlefield nervously and happily, ready to meet today's combat mission.
    Looking around from the Hudukou River embankment: densely packed pedestrians are squirming in all directions. The orderly ranks of the military workers advance, with gongs and drums beating in front of the team to lead the way. People in the distance can hear loud songs; those nearby can hear their cheerful laughter. Long lines and red flags converge on the control gate construction site on the other side.
    On this embankment, the military and civilian workers coming and going are like shuttles. Some are military workers carrying bamboo poles, others are civilian workers carrying heavy loads who have come from Changde and Yiyang in Hunan. This embankment has become a transportation embankment! Coming towards me are military workers carrying bamboo poles. Each person carries a long, large bamboo pole, which is very laborious; however, the People's Liberation Army soldiers, who have been trained for a long time, carry bamboo poles as lightly as if they were flying.
    I said: "You are working hard!"
    They replied happily:
    "Serving the people!"
    "Serving the people!" I am deeply moved by the profound meaning of this sentence. What thought-provoking language! From this answer, it seems that the question and answer are somewhat mismatched. However, I am very satisfied with this answer, because these are the most sincere words in their hearts. On the battlefield, they bravely eliminated the enemy with guns for the people; now, to build the motherland, they are diligently engaged in various labors for the people. All their actions are to serve the people; serving the people is the meaning of all their actions. They know that participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project is specifically serving the people, so they are working happily.
    On the sandy beach of the Hudukou River, neatly stacked piles of firewood, as high as mountains, and stacked reeds, rice straw, and grain. This is the strong supply support force of the people of Hunan and Hubei. This gives military and civilian workers and engineering and technical personnel a hundredfold confidence to work tirelessly. Look, in front, the loading and unloading work is proceeding rapidly amid the noisy sounds of shouts; in the rear, hundreds of white sails are floating, fully loaded with supplies, about to dock and land. This transportation army is flowing non-stop every minute. The boats are inscribed with: "Fully support the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, ensure fast loading, fast unloading, and fast transportation, and complete the transportation tasks ahead of schedule!" Their actions are just like this.
    On the other side of the Hudukou River, on the hillside of Huangshantou, explosives are detonating continuously, and white smoke drifts slowly in the sky in bursts. This increases the combat atmosphere on the construction site and also increases the joy of the military and civilian workers. This is a quarry machine and quarry workers mining stone. On this mountain, Comrade Bukov, a Soviet engineer, personally inspected the stones here and determined that they could be used for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. In this way, it is possible to "obtain materials locally." This practical scientific method solved the difficulty of the stone source. Now, tens of thousands of cubic meters of stone are being transported to the project site by boats and dump trucks.
    At the control gate construction site, skilled buglers are blowing loud bugle calls, gongs, drums and other percussion instruments are playing together, the soldiers are shouting, roaring, and whistling with joy, and have begun their selfless labor. This is fighting against floods, and the soldiers are also demonstrating the spirit they showed on the battlefield, working tensely. I crossed the Hudukou River and approached the battlefield of the soldiers, and saw that each of them was carrying hundreds of pounds of wet soil, rotating at high speed in an area of four hundred square meters. It looks like countless belts on motors, rotating in cycles, racing against time.
    This labor and combat scene of tens of thousands of people attracts me, and it also attracts the elderly and children who come from neighboring villages. All their thoughts are merged with the labor of the soldiers. Boatmen rushed ashore from the boats one after another, watching these great and highly educated Liberation Army soldiers laboring with excitement and agitation. The soldiers' lively labor image is deeply imprinted in their minds.
    Here, the atmosphere of revolutionary heroism competition is overflowing. The full emotions of each soldier explain this point. I entered the construction site and explained to a responsible comrade that I was there to interview. He then introduced Comrade Ren Chuanhua, who had completed three times the task of carrying soil yesterday. Comrade Chuanhua was not wearing a shirt, revealing his strong and sturdy arms, and shook hands with me with a smile. A photographer took a picture of him. This was quickly composed into a fast-paced rap by a mobilizer comrade holding a bamboo board: Carry quickly, load quickly, everyone strives to have a photo taken...
    Comrade Liu Shichang, who participated in the National Hero and Model Conference, is digging soil tirelessly and forcefully. The all-army four-good model class, which has outstanding achievements in policy discipline, unity and mutual assistance, outstanding achievements, and consolidating the troops, is carrying soil non-stop. Class leader Comrade Zhou Xiaochun said to me: We must make another collective contribution to this project and strive to add another good. I saw the regimental commander and chief of staff of a certain regiment also carrying soil like the soldiers. For the construction of the motherland, for the protection of the three million people and seven million mu of fertile land in the Jianghan Plain, the heroes are working hard.
    I was infected by this vivid scene, and I know in what kind of posture the people of the heroic motherland are building their beautiful motherland.
    This flood control gate will soon stand under Huangshantou. From this year on, the farmers in this area who have repeatedly suffered from flood disasters will never have their lives and property taken away by floods again. In front of them, there are only beautiful land and beautiful rivers, and the disasters of the past will never happen again.

    在荆江分洪工地上
    编者按：正在进行着的长江中游荆江分洪工程，是新中国的伟大水利建设工程之一。它将要消除该地区近四百年来经常遭受的水灾，使两岸变成肥沃的耕地。这两篇报道原载“长江文艺”第四十期，部分地反映了参加这一工程的人民解放军战士、民工和机械厂工人们的热烈的劳动情况。
    我们希望文艺工作者们深入生活，到祖国的各个生产建设的战线上去，多多地反映人民的斗争生活。
    虎渡河边的英雄们
    吴海
    东方刚刚发亮，天空还是灰色的，虎渡河两岸的军工民工同志们，都活跃起来了！挑起箩筐，扛起铁锹，在这晨风到处送着油菜花香的土地上，人群浩浩荡荡地流动着。他们像战士们荷着武器一样，紧张而愉快地走向战场，迎接今天的战斗任务。
    从虎渡河堤上四周眺望：密密麻麻的行人，在四面八方蠕动着。军工们有秩序的行列向前进发，队前边有打响的锣鼓引着路。远处的人，可以听见唱着宏亮的歌声；近处的，可以听见他们欢快的谈笑声。一条一条的长列，一面一面的红旗，都集中在彼岸的节制闸工地。
    就在这道堤上，往来的军工民工像穿梭一样。他们有的是扛着竹竿的军工，有的是从湖南常德、益阳赶来的挑着重担的民工。这条堤成为运输堤了！从我的对面走来的，是正在搬运竹竿的军工。一个人扛着一根长大的竹竿，非常吃力；但是，久经锻炼的人民解放军战士们，扛起竹竿，轻快若飞。
    我说：“辛苦了！”
    他们却高兴地回答我：
    “为人民服务！”
    “为人民服务！”我深深被这句话的深刻含意感动了。这是多么能引人深思的语言呵！从这个回答看来，似乎有些所问非所答。但是，我却十分满意这样的回答，因为这是他们心中最真切的话。他们在战场上，为了人民，英勇地把拿枪的敌人消灭了；现在建设祖国，他们为了人民，又在辛勤地从事着各种劳动。他们的一切行动，都是为人民服务的；为人民服务，是他们一切行动的意义。他们知道，参加荆江分洪工程，就是具体地为人民服务，因之，他们在愉快地劳动着。
    虎渡河的沙滩上，整齐地堆着像山样高大的木柴堆，和垛起来的芦苇、稻草、粮食。这就是两湖人民雄厚的供给支援力量。这给军工民工和工程、干部人员百倍信心，去不辞劳苦地工作。看吧，前边仍在一片吆号嚣杂的声响中，迅速地进行着启卸工作；后边飘来了数以百计的白帆，满载着给养，又要靠岸起坡了。这一支运输大军，一分钟不停地在流动着。船上写着：“全力支援荆江分洪工程，保证快装快卸快运，提前完成运输任务！”他们的行动也就是这样。
    在虎渡河的彼岸，黄山头的山腰，炸药连续在爆炸着，白烟一朵一朵，徐徐飘浮在天空。这增加了工地上的战斗气氛，也增加了军工民工的喜悦。这是开山机和采石工人在开采石头。就在这座山上，苏联工程师布可夫同志，亲自检验了这里的石头，断定它是可供荆江分洪工程使用的。这样，就可以“就地取材”了。这种从实际出发的科学方法，解决了石头来源的困难。现在，数万方石头，正用船只和斗车运往工程地。
    节制闸的工地上，熟练的号手们，吹着响亮的冲锋号，锣、鼓等等的打击乐器在一齐鸣奏着，战士们在兴高采烈地喊着、吼着、吹着口哨，开始了忘我的劳动。这是在向洪水搏斗，战士们也就拿出在战场上的精神，紧张地战斗着。我过了虎渡河，走近战士们的战场上，看见他们每个人都挑着上百斤的湿土，在四百公尺方圆地区内，高速度地转动着。看去，好像无数条马达上的皮带，在循环转动，在同时间赛跑。
    这幅上万人的劳动、战斗场面，吸引着我，也吸引着从邻庄走来的老人和小孩子。他们的全部心思和战士们的劳动溶合在一起了。船工从船上纷纷跑上堤，以兴奋激动的心情，看着这伟大的、有着高度教养的解放军战士在劳动着。战士们的生龙活虎似的劳动形象，深深地印记在他们的脑子中。
    这里，洋溢着革命英雄主义竞赛的气氛。每个战士的饱满情绪，正说明了这点。我进入工地，向一位负责同志说明是来采访的。他便向我介绍在昨天超过三倍完成挑土任务的任传华同志。传华同志没有穿上衣，露着粗壮结实的臂膀，满面笑容地向我握手。一个摄影记者给他照像。这很快被手拿毛竹板的鼓动员同志编成快板：快快挑，快快装，每人争取照个像……
    参加全国英雄模范大会的刘时长同志，在不停地用力地挖着土。政策纪律、团结互助、战绩显著、巩固部队的全军四好模范班，在不住脚地挑着土。班长周小春同志对我说：要在这个工程中，再立集体功，争取再加上一好。我看见某团的团长和参谋长，也在和战士们一样地挑土。为了祖国建设，为了保护江汉平原三百万人口和七百万亩肥沃土地，英雄们都在艰苦地劳动着。
    我受了这生动场面的感染，我知道英雄祖国的人民是以一种怎样的姿态来建设自己美丽的祖国的。
    这个节制洪水的闸门，不久将要屹立在黄山头下。这一带屡受洪水灾难的农民，从今年起，生命财产永远不会再被洪水剥夺了。在他们的面前，只有美丽的土地和美丽的河流，旧日的灾难永远也不会再有了。
