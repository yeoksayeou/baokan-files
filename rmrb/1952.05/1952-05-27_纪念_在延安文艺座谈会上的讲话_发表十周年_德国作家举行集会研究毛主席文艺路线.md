(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th) German writers attending the Third German Writers' Congress, currently being held in Berlin under the auspices of the German Academy of Arts, held a meeting on the 23rd to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Professor Wolf (author of the play "Professor Mamlock"), the chairman, gave a brief opening speech, after which he invited Comrade Ji Pengfei, head of the Chinese Diplomatic Mission to the German Democratic Republic, to speak. In his speech, Comrade Ji Pengfei emphasized the importance of ideological remolding for Chinese literary and art workers. He said, "Only after undergoing ideological remolding can they advance along the path pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong ten years ago. Because of Comrade Mao Zedong's speech, New China's literary and art work has embarked on the correct path of development in the past ten years." He believed that Chairman Mao Zedong's speech has been highly praised among progressive German writers, which is of extremely great significance.

Subsequently, the famous female writer Anna Seghers delivered a speech. She introduced Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in detail, and used her recent impressions of New China's literary and art work during her visit to China to illustrate how Chairman Mao's literary and art line is being implemented. She called on all progressive German writers to study this document. Finally, she said: "Mao Zedong's speech is an important contribution of New China to the world's cultural treasury."

At the meeting, the German translation of Chairman Mao Zedong's poem "Ode to the Plum Blossom" was recited, and the new German translation of Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was distributed to German writers. This new translation was translated and published by the German Academy of Arts, and the end of the volume contains an afterword by Anna Seghers, which is one of the reference documents for the Writers' Congress.

The German Cultural Democratic Revival Association's official publication, the weekly "Sonntag," published excerpts of Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" on the entire page on the 25th, and published articles by writer Seghers, painter Linger, and literary critic Leon, explaining how this speech has helped their creative activities.

    纪念“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年
    德国作家举行集会研究毛主席文艺路线
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】在德国艺术学院主持下，正在柏林举行的德国第三届作家代表大会的德国作家，于二十三日举行了毛泽东主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年纪念会。主席沃尔夫教授（剧本“马门教授”的作者）致了简短的开幕词之后，就请我国驻德意志民主共和国外交使团姬鹏飞团长讲话。姬鹏飞团长在讲话中强调指出新中国文艺工作者进行思想改造的重要性。他说：“只有进行了思想改造之后，他们才能循着毛泽东同志在十年前所指出的道路前进。因为有了毛泽东同志这个讲话，新中国的文艺工作在过去十年中才走上了正确的发展道路。”他认为：毛泽东主席的讲话在德国进步作家中受到崇高的评价，这是有着极其重大的意义。
    随后由著名女作家安娜·西格斯演说。她详尽地介绍了毛泽东主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，并且用她最近访问中国时对新中国文艺工作的印象，来说明毛主席的文艺路线是怎样地被执行着。她号召德国全体进步作家研究这个文件。最后她说：“毛泽东的讲话是新中国对世界文化宝库的重要贡献。”
    会上朗诵了毛泽东主席的词“咏雪”的德文译文，并且把毛泽东主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的德文新译本分发给德国作家。这个新译本是德国艺术学院翻译和出版的，卷末附有安娜·西格斯的后记，是作家代表大会的参考文件之一。
    德国文化民主复兴协会机关刊“星期日”周刊在二十五日以整版地位摘要刊登了毛泽东主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，并且发表了作家西格斯、画家林格纳和文学批评家列恩的文章，说明这个讲话对他们的创作活动有过怎样的帮助。他们指出：这个讲话对德国和欧洲进步文艺界有着巨大影响。
