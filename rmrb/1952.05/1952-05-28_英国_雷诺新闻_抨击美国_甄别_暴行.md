Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The bloody atrocities of the American aggressors in forcibly implementing so-called "screening" in prisoner-of-war camps have been criticized by the British "Reynolds News." The newspaper published an article on the 18th, signed "Editor," stating: "A series of strange events have recently occurred on Koje Island, making the American claims and American screening methods truly begin to stink." The article said: "As I see it, the position we are now taking is based on bad law, ambiguous humanitarianism, and questionable facts."

The article, in discussing the absurd claim of the American aggressors that they refused to repatriate prisoners of war for "humanitarian" reasons, pointed out: For these so-called "prisoners of war who do not wish to be repatriated," "the North Korean prisoners of war can only be handed over to Syngman Rhee, and the Chinese prisoners of war to Chiang Kai-shek." And handing them over "to these two old men in the Asian sea" would put them "in danger." From this, it can be seen that America's so-called humanitarianism is completely shameless deception.

The article concluded: "After the Dodd and Colson incidents, we cannot believe the American story of prisoners of war who do not wish to be repatriated. What should we do? The best way is to abide by the law, that is, to abide by the Geneva provisions regarding the exchange of prisoners of war."

### 英国“雷诺新闻”  抨击美国“甄别”暴行

    英国“雷诺新闻”
    抨击美国“甄别”暴行
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国侵略者在战俘营内强迫实行所谓“甄别”的血腥暴行，受到英国“雷诺新闻”的抨击。该报于十八日发表署名为“编者”的文章说：“最近在巨济岛上发生了一连串的奇怪的事件，使美国的说法和美国的甄别方法确实开始臭气薰天起来”。文章说：“据我看来，我们现在所采取的立场是根据着坏的法律、暧昧的人道主义和可疑的事实的。”
    文章在谈到美国侵略者所谓他们拒绝遣返战俘是为了“人道主义”的荒唐说法时，指出：对于这些所谓“不愿被遣返的战俘”，“只有把北朝鲜战俘交给李承晚，中国战俘交给蒋介石”。而把他们“交给这两个亚洲海中的老头儿”，却要使他们“遇到危险”。由此可见，美国的所谓人道主义完全是无耻的欺骗说法。
    该文章最后表示：“在杜德、柯尔生事件以后，我们不能相信美国人所说的不愿被遣返的战俘的故事。我们应该怎样做呢？最好的办法是遵守法律，也就是遵守日内瓦关于交换战俘的规定。”
