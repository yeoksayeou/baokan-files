Xinhua News Agency, 19th: On May 5, 1952, the US government representative shamelessly presented a fabricated report to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, slandering the government of the People's Republic of China for illicitly selling heroin in Japan. For this reason, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issues a statement as follows:

The report presented by the US government representative to the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs on May 5, 1952, which slanders the government of the People's Republic of China for illicitly selling heroin in Japan, is a complete fabrication. As everyone knows, for more than a century, the harm caused by foreign aggressors forcing the import of opium and other drugs into China has long been deeply hated by the Chinese people. After the establishment of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, it has consistently and resolutely adopted and implemented a strict policy of prohibition of opium and other drugs. On February 24, 1950, the State Council of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China promulgated the "Order on the Strict Prohibition of Opium and Other Narcotics," and on November 1 of the same year, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued the "Order on the Promulgation of Provisional Regulations on the Management of Narcotic Drugs." Therefore, the sale of opium and narcotics is absolutely illegal in New China. As for the claim of selling heroin to Japan, it is an absolute slander against New China. On the contrary, the Japanese government used to sell heroin to China and promote a policy of poisoning, and today it is none other than the US government itself that is inheriting Japanese militarism's policy of poisoning Asia. Taking South Korea, which is controlled by the US military, as an example, according to the 1950 Korean Central Yearbook, since the US military landed in September 1945, it has openly encouraged the sale of opium. People poisoned by opium are everywhere in South Korea. In the short period up to the end of 1948 alone, there were more than 210,000 opium addicts throughout South Korea, and more than 80,000 in Seoul alone.

The US government's slander against our country in the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs is clearly a shameless rumor. It attempts to use this to cover up its own crime of promoting a policy of poisoning, especially after the US aggressor troops launched bacteriological warfare, harming the Chinese and Korean people, and being severely criticized by world public opinion, it attempts to use this unfounded fabrication to divert the attention of the people of the world, but this trick is in vain, and it cannot deceive the fair-minded people of all countries. The Central People's Government and people of the People's Republic of China resolutely protest the US government representative's report slandering China in the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The US government's hidden intention behind this fabrication is certain to fail. May 19, 1952

### 我中央人民政府外交部发表声明  抗议美国政府诬蔑我在日本私卖海洛英

    我中央人民政府外交部发表声明
    抗议美国政府诬蔑我在日本私卖海洛英
    【新华社十九日讯】一九五二年五月五日美国政府代表在联合国麻醉药品委员会上无耻地提出诬蔑我中华人民共和国政府在日本私卖海洛英的捏造报告。为此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部发表声明如下：
    一九五二年五月五日美国政府代表在联合国麻醉药品委员会所提诬蔑中华人民共和国政府在日本私卖海洛英的报告完全是无稽的捏造。如众周知，百余年来，外国侵略者强迫向中国输入鸦片等毒品所导致的危害，早已使中国人民深恶痛绝。中华人民共和国中央人民政府成立后对鸦片等毒品一贯地坚决地采取并执行了严厉禁绝的政策。一九五零年二月二十四日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府政务院曾颁布“关于严禁鸦片烟毒的通令”，同年十一月一日中央人民政府卫生部又发表了“关于管理麻醉药品暂行条例的公布令”。因此，鸦片毒品的贩卖，在新中国是绝对违法的。至于向日本贩卖海洛英之说，那是对新中国的绝对诽谤。相反的，过去日本政府倒一向是向中国贩卖海洛英推行毒化政策的，而今天继承日本军国主义在亚洲推行毒化政策的不是别人，正是美国政府自己。单就美国军队控制下的南朝鲜说，根据一九五零年朝鲜中央年鉴所载，自一九四五年九月美军登陆以来，即公开奖励贩卖鸦片，在南朝鲜因吸鸦片而中毒者到处皆是，仅到一九四八年底的短短期间，南朝鲜全境已有二十一万鸦片中毒者，汉城一地就有八万余人。
    美国政府在联合国麻醉药品委员会上对我国的诬蔑，显然是无耻的造谣。它妄图借此掩饰其本身推行毒化政策的罪行，尤其在美国侵略军发动细菌战，残害中朝人民，遭到世界舆论严重抨击后，更图以此莫须有的捏造来转移世界人民的注意，但这种诡计是徒劳的，它欺骗不了各国的公正人民。中华人民共和国中央人民政府和人民坚决抗议美国政府代表在联合国麻醉药品委员会上所做的诬蔑中国的报告。美国政府在这一捏造下面所隐藏的企图是肯定地要失败的。一九五二年五月十九日
