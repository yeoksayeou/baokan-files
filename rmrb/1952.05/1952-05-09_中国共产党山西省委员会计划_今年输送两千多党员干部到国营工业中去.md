The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Plans to Transfer Over Two Thousand Party Cadres to State-Owned Industries This Year

Xinhua News Agency

In order to strengthen the Communist Party's political leadership in state-owned industries and prepare for large-scale economic construction, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party plans to transfer over two thousand Party cadres to state-owned industries this year. The first group of over two hundred Party cadres at or above the county level has already been transferred to various factories and mines to take up work.

Drawing these Party cadres to work in industrial departments is an important step for the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC to shift the focus of its leadership to industry. In the past, the Shanxi Provincial Committee sent many Party cadres to work in state-owned industries, thus ensuring the restoration and development of industrial production. Last year, the total value of industrial production in the province increased by 1.37 times compared to 1949, and the proportion of industry in the entire national economy increased from 15 percent in 1949 to 20.3 percent. With the support of industry, agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level by 9 percent, with cotton exceeding the pre-war level by 78 percent. However, agriculture still needs greater support from industry. At the same time, the "Three-Anti" movement also reflected that some factories and mines, due to the lack of strong Party leadership, had a tendency to become detached from politics. After considering the above situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC, in order to meet the growing needs of industrial construction for cadres and strengthen the Party's political leadership, decided to send a large number of Party cadres to state-owned industries this year.

When the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC transferred these Party cadres to industrial departments, it organized them into work groups and sent them to various factories and mines to assist in carrying out the "Three-Anti" movement, so that they could familiarize themselves with the situation while assisting in the work, and then gradually assign work according to needs. Therefore, dispatching work groups has become the best way to ensure the simultaneous victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign and production in various factories and mines, and to train cadres.

The majority of these Party cadres participating in the industrial sector are taking on the organizational work of the Party in various industrial and mining enterprises. One prefectural-level and twenty-one county-level Party cadres sent to the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have mostly taken on the work of the Party committee and the Party branches in various production departments of the plant.

    中国共产党山西省委员会计划
    今年输送两千多党员干部到国营工业中去
    为加强国营工业中共产党的政治领导并给大规模经济建设作准备，中国共产党山西省委员会计划在今年输送二千多党员干部到国营工业中去。头一批县级以上党员干部二百多人，已分别调到各厂矿担任工作。
    抽调这批党员干部到工业部门工作，是中共山西省委将领导工作重点转入工业的一个重要步骤。山西省委过去曾派不少党员干部到国营工业工作，因而保证了工业生产的恢复和发展。去年全省工业生产总值已较一九四九年增加了一点三七倍，工业在整个国民经济中所占的比例由一九四九年的百分之十五增加到百分之二十点三。在工业的支援下，农业生产已超过战前水平的百分之九，其中棉花超过战前百分之七十八。但是农业仍要工业作更大的支援。同时，“三反”运动中，也反映出某些厂矿因缺少党的坚强领导，产生了脱离政治的倾向。中共山西省委在考虑了以上情况之后，为了满足工业建设日益增长着的干部需要及加强党的政治领导，决定今年派大批党员干部到国营工业中去。
    中共山西省委在抽调这批党员干部到工业部门时，曾将这些干部组成工作小组，分赴各厂矿协助开展“三反”运动，使他们在帮助工作中熟悉情况，再根据需要陆续分配工作。因此派遣工作小组成为保证各厂矿“三反”和生产同时获胜并借以训练干部的最好方式。
    这批参加工业部门的党员干部，大部担任各工矿党的组织工作，派到太原钢铁厂的一个地委级和二十一个县级党员干部，大部担任了该厂中共党委及各生产部门党的支部工作。    （新华社）
