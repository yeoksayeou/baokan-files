To the Editor: Certain business offices of sub-branches of the People's Bank of Nantong Prefecture, Northern Jiangsu, carried out rural savings work without thorough publicity and education to enable cadres and the masses to understand the significance of savings, resulting in bias.

The Qutang Business Office of the Hai'an People's Bank in the district mobilized the masses to save through individual township cadres, forcing them to make self-reports and mutual evaluations at meetings; when the masses were unwilling to save, they would sleep in the homes of the masses until they agreed to save before leaving. Some cadres at the Gaozhuang Business Office in Rugao, upon seeing the masses eating pork, actually said: "You can eat pork, but you can't save?" More seriously, some cadres failed to persuade a family to save after several attempts, and ultimately violated human rights by tying up members of the family with ropes. Some areas had a serious purely task-oriented view in promoting this work, and the content of the publicity was inappropriate. When cadres in the Motou District of Rugao publicized to the masses, they said: "Loving the country means saving, and not saving means not showing love for the country." The masses were very dissatisfied with this statement.

The reason for the above phenomenon is that some bank cadres and rural cadres have a serious purely task-oriented viewpoint and a commandist style. Currently, the Nantong Prefecture Central Sub-branch has instructed its subordinate county sub-branches to quickly correct this bias. This lesson is also worth noting for other regions.

### 南通专区人民银行某些支行  开展农村储蓄工作发生偏向

    南通专区人民银行某些支行
    开展农村储蓄工作发生偏向
    编辑同志：苏北南通专区某些人民银行支行营业所没有经过深入的宣传教育，使干部和群众了解储蓄的意义，就开展农村储蓄工作，结果发生了偏向。
    该区海安人民银行曲塘营业所通过个别乡干部动员群众储蓄，强迫群众在会上自报互评；群众不认储，他们就睡在群众家里，直到认储以后才走。如皋高庄营业所有些干部看见群众吃猪肉，竟说：“你们能吃猪肉，不能储蓄吗？”更严重的是，有的干部几次动员一家认储都没有成功，最后竟侵犯人权，用绳子捆这家的人。有些地区在推行这一工作时有严重的单纯任务观点，宣传的内容是不适当的。如皋磨头区干部向群众宣传时说：“爱国就要储蓄，不储蓄就没有爱国表现”，群众对这种说法很不满意。
    产生上述现象的原因，是某些银行干部和农村干部有严重的单纯任务观点和强迫命令作风。目前南通专区中心支行已指示所属各县支行，迅速纠正这种偏向。这一教训也是值得其它地区注意的。
