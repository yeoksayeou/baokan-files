    Promote Quick Literacy Method to Gradually Eliminate Illiteracy Among Workers and Peasants

    The creation of the quick literacy method has extremely important significance for the work of eliminating illiteracy in New China. We must value this advanced teaching method, widely publicize and promote it, and gradually eliminate illiteracy among workers and peasants.

    What is the effect of the quick literacy method in experiments in factories and rural areas? Can it be implemented? Some comrades have had such questions. Regarding this issue, the People's Daily's publication on April 24, April 28, and May 6 of the experimental achievements of certain worker and peasant quick literacy classes in Chongqing and Beijing have given affirmative answers, proving that the quick literacy method is not only fully applicable to soldiers, but also to workers and peasants.

    Why is the quick literacy method also applicable to adult education for workers and peasants?

    First, the quick literacy method adopts a "teach more, learn more, devour greedily" blitz approach to meet the adult's eagerness to learn, while also using the "disperse difficulties, gradually occupy" method to help adults memorize, and finally achieve the goal of skillfully mastering the tool of writing, which is suitable for general adult education.

    Second, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers and peasants in New China has been raised to an unprecedented level, and they have universally recognized the truth that "to achieve industrialization, we must learn culture;" at the same time, they also know that "to manage state affairs well, we must first recognize characters." This is a favorable condition for promoting the quick literacy method.

    Third, the current worker and peasant spare-time education in New China has already made great progress. The number of workers participating in learning nationwide has reached 2.02 million, and the number of peasants participating in winter schools last year is estimated to be nearly 40 million. Moreover, there is a good working foundation in terms of organizational leadership, teaching equipment, and teacher training. This provides extremely favorable conditions for gradually promoting the quick literacy method in worker and peasant spare-time education nationwide. Although the troops are concentrated, highly organized, and convenient for blitzing, the worker and peasant masses in factories and rural areas today also have good organization. We believe that under the strong leadership of the grassroots Party, Youth League, trade unions, and peasant associations, it is entirely possible to vigorously promote the quick literacy method in the already organized worker and peasant spare-time schools.

    How to promote the quick literacy method in worker and peasant education?

    First, we must carry out extensive publicity among the worker and peasant masses. The Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government Government Affairs Council held an award ceremony on April 23, awarding Qi Jianhua, the creator of the quick literacy method. It is hoped that all localities can use newspapers, magazines, radio, slides, and other means to carry out thorough and universal publicity, so that the quick literacy method can be promoted throughout the country.

    Second, the quick literacy method must be promoted gradually under leadership. The National Staff and Workers Spare-time Education Committee of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee on April 24, listened to the situation and experience of Beijing and Tianjin in experimenting with the quick literacy method in factories and rural areas, and discussed how to use the quick literacy method to eliminate illiteracy among staff and workers nationwide in the future. It was also decided that Beijing and Tianjin will formulate specific promotion plans in the near future. Currently, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shanghai, and the Northeast and other places have begun experimenting, and other regions can also conduct trial runs with leadership and focus, in order to gain experience and prepare for large-scale cultural learning campaigns in the future.

    Third, training a large number of teachers is the most important issue in promoting the quick literacy method. According to the experience of Beijing and Tianjin, current teachers of worker and peasant spare-time schools can be drawn and given short-term rotational training, so that they can master the teaching methods of the phonetic alphabet, pinyin, blitzing new characters, reading, and writing stages in a very short period of time. Another approach is that quick literacy method experimental classes can absorb nearby spare-time school teachers to participate in trial runs, so that they can learn this teaching method from practice.

    Fourth, compile textbooks for the quick literacy method. To vigorously promote the quick literacy method in worker and peasant spare-time schools, we must quickly solve the problem of textbooks. It is recommended that the relevant cultural and educational departments in various localities organize appropriate cadres to compile the basic teaching materials for the quick literacy method, such as the phonetic alphabet chart, the pinyin method chart, the commonly used character chart, and phonetic literacy textbooks, etc. And compile various popular readings for the broad masses of workers and peasants to read, in order to improve their reading ability.

    推广速成识字法逐步扫除工农中的文盲
    石瑛
    速成识字法的创造，对于新中国扫除文盲的工作有着极其重大的作用。我们必须重视这一先进的教学方法，广泛地进行宣传、推广，逐步扫除工农中的文盲。
    速成识字法在工厂和农村中实验的效果怎样？它能推行吗？有些同志曾有过这样的疑问。关于这个问题，人民日报四月二十四日、四月二十八日、五月六日发表的重庆、北京的某些工农速成识字班的实验成绩，已给了肯定的答复，证明速成识字法不仅完全适用于战士，而且也适用于工人和农民。
    为什么速成识字法也适用于工农成人教育？
    首先，速成识字法采用“多教多学，狼吞虎咽”的突击方法，来满足成人急于求知的要求，同时又利用“分散难点，逐步占有”的方法，来帮助成人的记忆，最后达到熟练掌握文字工具的目的，是适合于一般成人教育的。
    其次，新中国广大工农群众的阶级觉悟空前提高，他们普遍地认识到“要想工业化，必须学文化”的道理；同时也知道了“管好国家事，首先必须认识字”。这就是推广速成识字法的有利条件。
    再次，目前新中国的工农业余教育已经有了很大的发展，全国参加学习的工人已达二百零二万人，去年参加冬学的农民估计将近四千万人。而且在组织领导、教学设备、师资的培养等方面都有了较好的工作基础。这就为在全国工农业余教育中逐步推广速成识字法，提供了极其有利的条件。虽然部队集中，组织性强，便于突击，但是工厂和农村中的工农群众，今日也有了很好的组织，我们相信在基层党、团、工会、农会的坚强领导下，在已经组织起来工人和农民业余学校中大力推广速成识字法是完全可能的。
    如何在工农教育中推广速成识字法？
    首先要在工农群众中进行广泛的宣传。中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会已于四月二十三日举行了给奖典礼，奖励了速成识字法的创造者祁建华。希望各地能够通过报纸、杂志、广播、幻灯等充分地进行深入而又普遍的宣传，使速成识字法推广到全国去。
    第二、必须有领导地逐步推广速成识字法。中央人民政府教育部全国职工业余教育委员会已于四月二十四日召开了常委扩大会议，听取了北京和天津在工厂和农村中实验速成识字法的情况和经验，又讨论了今后如何在全国职工中利用速成识字法扫除文盲的问题，并决定京、津两市在最近期内制定具体的推广计划。现北京、天津、重庆、上海和东北等地已开始实验，其他地区也可以有领导地有重点地进行试办，以期取得经验，准备在今后大规模地开展文化学习运动。
    第三、大量培养师资是推广速成识字法的一个最重要的问题。根据北京、天津两市的经验，可以抽调工农业余学校的现任教师加以短期轮训，使他们在很短的时期内掌握注音符号、拼音、突击生字、阅读、写作等阶段的教学方法。另一种方式是，速成识字法实验班可以吸收临近的业余学校教师参加试办，使他们从实践中学习这一教学方法。
    第四、编写速成识字法的教材。要想在工农业余学校中大力推广速成识字法，必须迅速地解决教材问题。建议各地有关文教部门组织适当的干部，编辑速成识字法的基本教材，如注音符号表、拼音方法表、常用字表，有注音的识字课本等。并编写各种通俗读物，供给广大的工人、农民阅读，以提高他们的阅读能力。
