Is the British government in Hong Kong willingly following the will of American imperialism, resorting to all despicable and shameless means to persecute the Chinese people of Hong Kong in order to achieve its disgraceful goals? The British government in Hong Kong has answered this question affirmatively with facts. The Hong Kong Chinese people's newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, being ordered to suspend publication for half a year in an illegal "trial," and the persons in charge of Ta Kung Pao being illegally sentenced, is this answer. The British government in Hong Kong has personally torn off its mask, revealing a hideous face.

The matter happened like this: On March 20th, 21st, and 24th, the British government in Hong Kong successively arrested and charged ten persons in charge of three Chinese people's newspapers, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post, namely: Fei Yimin, owner and publisher of Ta Kung Pao; Bao Lichu, printer; Li Zongying, editor; Mei Wending, owner of Wen Wei Po; Yu Hongxiang, publisher; Wen Qiying, printer; Li Zisong, editor; Yang Xiufeng, owner of New Evening Post; Guo Yongwei, publisher; and Luo Fu, editor. The "crime" they were charged with was that the three newspapers they were responsible for had, on March 5th, "published inflammatory words involving the government of this colony (referring to the British government in Hong Kong)."

What kind of text was this? It turns out that the British government in Hong Kong was referring to a news item broadcast by the New China News Agency on March 4th—a short commentary in the People's Daily in Beijing that day, entitled "Protest Against British Imperialism's Killing of Our Residents in Hong Kong." The People's Daily commentary pointed out that the British government in Hong Kong's illegal persecution of our residents was becoming increasingly serious. In January of this year, it illegally arrested and expelled Sima Wensen, Li Wenxing, and others, film workers and representatives of Kowloon disaster victims. On March 1st, it dispatched a large number of troops and police, in a planned and organized manner, to massacre local Chinese residents and arrest patriotic compatriots on a large scale. This fully demonstrates that British imperialism is continuing to follow the will of the United States, deliberately persecuting our people in Hong Kong, in an attempt to realize its conspiracy to turn Hong Kong into a base for imperialism to invade our country. The commentary warned the British government in Hong Kong that if it does not stop this provocative atrocity, it will surely suffer a crushing defeat in the face of the great power of the Chinese people.

It is very clear that the People's Daily, based on true facts, expressed a righteous protest and issued a solemn warning on behalf of the 475 million Chinese people against the atrocities of the British government in Hong Kong. It was the duty and sacred and inviolable right of the Hong Kong Chinese people's newspapers, Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, and New Evening Post, to publish such a commentary of great significance. However, the British government in Hong Kong not only did not learn the proper lesson from this commentary and sincerely repent, but instead insisted on calling it "inflammatory text" and launched a frenzied persecution against the three newspapers that published it.

On April 16th, the Hong Kong British High Court first began the so-called "trial" of the persons in charge of Ta Kung Pao. Of course, the result of the trial was predictable. On the day of sentencing, May 5th, many journalists waiting for the verdict in the courtroom had already written the news of the verdict, waiting only to fill in the term of imprisonment and the amount of the fine. However, although the British imperialists can violently force Ta Kung Pao to suspend publication and sentence its persons in charge, they have to pay a high price. The fifteen-day trial process has completely exposed its carefully disguised two-faced policy and revealed its ugly nature.

First, the British government in Hong Kong exhausted all means to "establish" the crime of Ta Kung Pao of "inciting rebellion," but it could not find a single witness to support this false accusation. Even the prosecution's witness, Peng De, Chairman of the Hong Kong Municipal Health Bureau, had to admit when answering questions from the defendant's defense lawyer that he "could not see any place in the People's Daily commentary that incited violence," but only that it "seemed to have the meaning of protest." The British government in Hong Kong used this point to convict it of "inciting rebellion"! It also completely ignored the fact that other Hong Kong newspapers, such as Sing Tao Daily, had also published Beijing broadcasts of a similar nature to the People's Daily commentary on March 4th. All this clearly shows that the reason why Ta Kung Pao was suspended was not because it "incited" anything, but simply because the British government in Hong Kong was determined to pursue the policy of American imperialism to turn Hong Kong into a base for invading China, and it deliberately wanted to cut off the connection between the Chinese people of Hong Kong and the motherland. This is not a so-called judicial case at all, but a political action, and those who made this action have shown that they are determined to pursue a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people.

British imperialists often like to boast about their "democracy" and "rule of law," but the trial of Ta Kung Pao proves that when they are pursuing ulterior political motives, they don't care about using "democracy" and "rule of law" as fig leaves. The defendant's defense lawyer pointed out clearly on the first day of the trial that even according to Hong Kong law, this litigation procedure was completely illegal. When making the arrest, the British government in Hong Kong did not issue the necessary certificate to the Hong Kong High Court, and the arrest warrant it issued did not have the indispensable signature of the judge, nor did it state the reason for the arrest of the defendant. For this reason, the defendant's defense lawyer pointed out that the British government in Hong Kong's actions were like sending troops to arrest people for trial in the era of King Charles I of England. He solemnly demanded that the judge immediately stop this illegal litigation, but the judge, after shamelessly admitting that "there are procedural irregularities," still brazenly announced the continuation of the trial.

In order to deliberately frame Ta Kung Pao, the British government in Hong Kong did not hesitate to translate the People's Daily commentary into exaggerated English in order to fabricate a crime. However, the prosecution's witness, Chen Guoying, chief translator of the Hong Kong High Court, admitted under cross-examination by the defendant's defense lawyer on April 22nd that there were three obvious errors in the translation. Chen Guoying had initially claimed to be the translator of the commentary, but in the end he had to admit that he had not translated it at all.

In this situation of being at a loss for words, the judge of the Hong Kong High Court had no choice but to repeatedly use violent means to prevent the defendant's defense lawyer from questioning and arguing, and to force the litigation to proceed. For example, when the defendant's defense lawyer requested to read out some corroborating text, the judge said: "I don't want to hear your reasons." Under the insistence of the defendant's defense lawyer, the judge said loudly: "I am the authority of this court. If I am wrong, there is a remedy, but I have already announced my decision." When the defendant's defense lawyer questioned the prosecution's witness, Scott, the chief superintendent of the Kowloon City Police Station, and Scott was speechless, the judge said to the defendant's defense lawyer: "I don't like you moving around."

What was far beyond the wishes of the British imperialists in this trial was that the trial process completely confirmed that the "March 1st" incident was completely planned and organized by the British government in Hong Kong. The prosecution's witness, McPherson, Superintendent of the Yau Ma Tei District of the Hong Kong British Government, admitted when questioned by the defendant's defense lawyer on April 24th that the Hong Kong police had prepared tear gas in advance on March 1st and had long ago transferred two teams of police from Hong Kong to Kowloon. After launching an attack on the masses, the police used 197 tear gas canisters and fired three shots, injuring five Chinese, one of whom died in Kowloon Hospital due to injuries, namely textile worker Chen Dayi. This confession proves that the reports of Ta Kung Pao on the "March 1st" incident and the facts on which the People's Daily commentary was based are completely true. Another prosecution witness, Mulley, Director of the Hong Kong British Government Information Office, admitted under cross-examination by the defendant's defense lawyer that the news he released on March 1st and the statement issued by the British Colonial Secretary Littleton on the same incident were inconsistent with the facts. In particular, Mulley's irresponsible announcement that day of the false news that "the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Organizations Delegation to Comfort the Disaster-stricken Compatriots of Dongtou Village, Kowloon City" would arrive in Hong Kong at 10:30 am was an important step in creating this bloody incident. Zhao Jiewen, the young woman who was hit by a police car in the "March 1st" incident, and her friend Liang Ruixia, and the worker Chen Weifen who was beaten by the police, all vividly and powerfully accused the brutality of the British police when they testified in court on May 1st. Now, Ta Kung Pao's "case" has been illegally judged. But if the British government in Hong Kong thinks they have easily stifled the voice of the Chinese people, they are wrong. The Chinese people have repeatedly issued protests and warnings to British imperialism, just as Fei Yimin and Li Zongying, persons in charge of Ta Kung Pao, said in court: "This protest represents the opinion of a quarter of the world's population." This protest says that "the great Chinese people will not allow anyone to bully them arbitrarily." If the British imperialists do not fully appreciate the significance of these protests, they must be prepared to pay a higher price for their crimes.

    荒谬的审判
    新华社记者  尚吟
    香港英国政府究竟是不是甘心仰承美帝国主义的意志而不惜使用一切卑鄙的、无耻的手段来迫害香港的中国人民以此来达到他们可耻的目的呢？这个问题已经由香港英国政府以事实作了肯定的回答了。香港中国人民的大公报在非法“审讯”中之被勒令停刊半年，大公报负责人之被非法判刑，就是这个回答。香港英国政府已亲手拉开了他的面幕，露出了一付狰狞的嘴脸。
    事情的发生是这样的，三月二十日、二十一和二十四日，香港英国政府先后逮捕和控告大公报、文汇报和新晚报三家中国人民报纸的十位负责人，即：大公报所有人兼督印人费彝民、承印人鲍立初、编辑李宗瀛、文汇报所有人梅文鼎、督印人余鸿翔、承印人温企鹰、编辑李子诵、新晚报所有人杨秀峰、督印人郭永伟、编辑罗孚。他们被控的“罪名”是因为据说他们所负责的三家报纸，曾在三月五日“刊载了涉及本殖民地政府（按指香港英国政府）的煽动性文字”。
    这是一篇什么样的文字呢？原来香港英国政府指的是新华通讯社在三月四日广播的一篇新闻——当天北京人民日报的一篇短评，题目是“抗议英帝国主义捕杀香港的我国居民”。人民日报的这篇短评指出：香港英国政府非法迫害我国居民的暴行越来越严重，今年一月间非法逮捕和驱逐了我国电影工作者及九龙灾民代表的司马文森、李文兴等人，三月一日又出动大批军警有计划地有布置地屠杀当地我国居民，并大规模地逮捕我爱国同胞。这充分表现了英帝国主义是在继续顺从美国的意旨，蓄意迫害香港的我国人民，以图实现其把香港变为帝国主义侵犯我国的基地的阴谋。这篇短评警告香港英国政府，假如它不停止这种挑衅暴行，一定会在中国人民的伟大力量面前碰得头破血流。
    十分明显，人民日报在这里是根据了千真万确的事实，而代表四亿七千五百万中国人民对香港英国政府的暴行表示了正义的抗议并提出郑重的警告。香港中国人民的大公报、文汇报和新晚报把这样一篇具有重大意义的短评刊载出来乃是它们的天职，也是它们神圣不可侵犯的权利。但是，香港英国政府却不仅不去从这篇短评中得到应有教训，诚心悔过，却反而把它硬说成是“煽动性文字”，而且对刊载这篇短评的三家报纸发动了疯狂的迫害。
    四月十六日，香港英国高等法院首先对大公报的负责人开始了所谓“审讯”。当然，审讯的结果是早就可以料想得到的。五月五日宣判那一天，在法庭上听候宣判的记者中就有许多早已写好了判决的消息，只等填上徒刑的期限与罚款的数字。但是，虽然英帝国主义者可以横暴地强迫大公报停刊，把它的负责人判刑，但是却不得不付出高昂的代价。连续十五天的审讯过程已完全拆穿了它小心伪装的两面政策而暴露了自己的丑恶本质。
    首先，香港英国政府费尽心机想要“确立”大公报“煽动叛乱”的罪名，但是他却找不到一个证人来支持这种诬害，甚至主控方面的证人、香港市政卫生局主席彭德在回答被告辩护律师的质问时都不能不承认在人民日报的短评中“看不到有任何激起暴力之处”，只是“看来有抗议的意思”。就是这一点，香港英国政府却把它当作“煽动叛乱”来判罪！它并且完全不顾别的香港报纸，例如星岛日报也曾在三月四日刊载过性质与人民日报短评相类似的北京广播这种事实。所有这一切明白地说明了大公报之所以被停刊并不是因为它“煽动”了什么，而只是因为香港英国政府决心奉行美帝国主义要变香港为侵华基地的政策，它蓄意要切断香港中国人民与祖国的连系。这完全不是一个所谓司法性的案件，而是一个政治行动，做出这种行动的人们表明他们已决心奉行与中国人民为敌的政策。
    英帝国主义者常常喜欢吹嘘自己的“民主”与“法治”，但是对大公报的审讯证明，当他们追逐着不可告人的政治目的的时候，他们就顾不得要“民主”、“法治”这类遮羞布了。被告的辩护律师在审讯的第一天就明白指出：即使根据香港的法律，这次诉讼程序也是完全非法的。香港英国政府在进行逮捕时，并没有向香港高等法院出具必需的证书，而它所出的拘票上竟然没有不可缺少的法官的签字，同时也没有说明拘捕被告的理由。为此，被告的辩护律师曾经指出：香港英国政府这种行径就好像在英王查理一世时代派了兵去抓人来受审一样。他严正地要求法官立即停止这种非法诉讼，但是法官在老着脸皮承认“有不合程序之处”以后，仍悍然宣告继续审讯。
    为了要对大公报曲意构陷，香港英国政府甚至不惜把人民日报的短评译成夸大的英文，以便罗织入罪。但是，主控方面的证人，香港高等法院的首席翻译陈国英在四月二十二日出庭作证时，一经被告辩护律师盘问，就承认在译文中有三处明显的错误。陈国英开头曾自称是这篇短评的译者，但最后竟不得不承认原来他并没有翻译。
    在这种理屈辞穷的情况下，香港高等法院的法官只有一再采取横暴的手段来阻止被告辩护律师的质询与申辩，强制诉讼的进行。例如：当被告辩护律师要求宣读若干旁证文字的时候，法官竟说：“我不要听你的理由”，在被告辩护律师坚持之下，法官又高声说：“我是本法庭的权威，假使我错了，还有补救办法，但是我已宣布了我的决定了。”当被告辩护律师盘问主控方面证人——九龙城警署总帮办史高特而史高特哑口无言时，法官竟对被告辩护律师说：“我不喜欢你动来动去。”
    在这次审讯中远出于英帝国主义者愿望之外的是，审讯的过程完全证实了“三一”事件是香港英国政府完全有计划、有布置地制造出来的。主控方面证人、香港英国政府油麻地区警司麦花臣在四月二十四日受到被告辩护律师盘问时承认，香港警方在三月一日预先准备了催泪弹，并且老早就从香港方面调动了两队警察到九龙去。在对群众发动攻击后，警方曾使用了催泪弹一百九十七枚、放枪三发，伤了五个中国人，其中一人因伤死亡在九龙医院，即纺织工人陈达仪。这种招供证明了大公报关于“三一”事件的报道，以及人民日报短评所根据的事实完全是确实的。而另一主控方面证人，香港英国政府新闻处长穆磊，在受被告辩护律师盘问时，却承认他在三月一日发表的新闻和英国殖民大臣里特尔顿就同一事件发表声明都与事实不符，特别是穆磊在那天不负责任地宣告“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团”将于上午十时半抵达香港的错误消息，乃是制造了这次血腥事件的一个重要步骤。在“三一”事件中被警车撞伤的青年女子赵洁雯和她的朋友梁瑞霞，被警察毒打的工人陈伟芬等，在五月一日出庭作证时，都生动而有力地控诉了英国警察的暴行。现在，大公报的“案件”已经被非法判决了。但是香港英国政府如果以为他们已经轻易地扼杀了中国人民的声音，那就错了。中国人民已经一再对英帝国主义发出了抗议和警告，正如大公报负责人费彝民、李宗瀛在法庭上所说：“这种抗议代表着全世界四分之一人口的意见”。这种抗议是说“伟大的中国人民是不容任何人任意欺侮的”。如果英帝国主义者不去充分估计这些抗议的意义，它就必须准备为它的罪行付出更高的代价。
