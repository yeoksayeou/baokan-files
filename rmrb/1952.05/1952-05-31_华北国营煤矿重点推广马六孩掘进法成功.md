The "Ma Liuhai Multi-Tunnel Cycle Tunneling Method" has been successfully promoted in key state-owned coal mines in the North China region, including Jingxi, Yangquan, Fengfeng, Jiaozuo, and Jingxing. To date, key promotion groups in various mines have overcome ideological obstacles and resolved specific problems arising during the promotion process. Tunneling speeds have generally increased by two to three times compared to the original, with the highest increase being 5.8 times. For example, the key promotion team at the Chengzi Mine in Jingxi, after reorganizing the labor organization, clarifying the responsibilities of each type of work, and improving drilling and blasting techniques, achieved an average tunneling speed of 11.9 meters per day in February and March, approximately three times the 4 meters before the promotion. In summarizing their experience in the promotion, they found that many problems remained unresolved, such as division of labor without cooperation among different types of work; shift changes taking place above ground, wasting one hour each time; and insufficient tools affecting operations. In April, they solved these problems while continuing the promotion, and the tunneling speed increased rapidly again. The third tunneling team reached an average of 25 meters per day in late April and set a record of 27.2 meters per day. The Liu Jiuxue rapid roadway driving team at Jiaozuo Coal Mine, due to the poor roof conditions, needed not only propping workers but also workers specifically managing the roof. Therefore, when reorganizing the labor organization in this promotion, they specifically established a "scaling" team. Three "scaling" workers were fixed in three recesses each shift, responsible for managing the roof, thus ensuring the safety of multi-tunnel cycle operations. At the same time, in order to have drilling, coal loading, propping, and other types of work proceed in an orderly and cyclical manner, they divided the drilling, coal loading, and propping workers into three groups, each working in one recess. They transferred, exchanged, and cycled simultaneously at certain times, and stipulated in the shift exchange system that the previous shift must leave the next shift one recess for drilling, one recess for coal loading, and one recess for propping, and leave six qualified, pre-cut wooden props. Therefore, they greatly reduced idle labor, and the tunneling speed significantly increased, averaging 24 meters per day, more than three times faster than the mine's past general tunneling speed.

From the results of this key promotion work in various mines in North China, it can be seen that despite different production conditions such as roof and specifications, all coal mines can adopt the "Ma Liuhai Multi-Tunnel Cycle Tunneling Method." Implementing it can not only solve the problem of tunneling not keeping up with coal mining needs, but also save the country a lot of expenses. For tunneling alone, calculated at 500 meters per month per tunneling team, state-owned coal mines in the North China region can save wealth worth 8,722 tons of millet in 1952 alone.

### 华北国营煤矿重点推广马六孩掘进法成功

    华北国营煤矿重点推广马六孩掘进法成功
    “马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法”，已在华北区国营京西、阳泉、峰峰、焦作、井陉等煤矿重点推广成功。到目前为止，各矿重点推广组都已克服了思想障碍，解决了推广中发生的具体问题，掘进速度一般在原来的基础上提高了二至三倍，最高的提高了五点八倍。如京西城子矿重点推广小组，在整顿了劳动组织，划清了各工种的职责，改进了打眼放炮技术后，二、三两个月的平均掘进速度达日进十一点九公尺，约等于推广前四公尺的三倍。他们在总结推广中的经验时，发现仍有不少问题没有解决，如各工种职责虽划清了，但只分工不合作；交接班在井上进行，每次要浪费一个小时；工具不够用，影响作业等。四月份，他们在继续推广中解决了这些问题，掘进速度又飞快提高，第三掘进组四月下旬达到平均日进二十五公尺，并创造了日进二十七公尺二的纪录。焦作煤矿刘九学快速送道大队，由于顶板较坏，不但需要支柱工，还需要专门管理顶板的工人，所以他们在这次推广中整顿劳动组织时，专门成立了一个“刷帮”组，每班三个“刷帮”工人固定在三个窝头里，负责管理顶板，这样就保证了多孔道循环作业的安全。同时，为了打眼、装煤、支柱等工种有次序地进行循环作业，他们把打眼、装煤、支柱工人分别组成三个小组，各在一个窝头工作，一定时间同时转移、互调、循环，并在交换班制度中规定：上一班必须给下一班留一个打眼的窝头、一个可以装煤的窝头和一个可以支棚的窝头，并留下六根合乎规格的砍好口的木柱。因此，他们大大减少了窝工现象，掘进速度显著提高，平均日进二十四公尺，比该矿过去一般的掘进速度提高了三倍多。
    从华北各矿这次重点推广工作的结果来看，尽管顶板、规格等生产条件不同，各地煤矿都可以采用“马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法”。实行后不但可以解决掘进赶不上采煤需要的问题，而且可为国家节省大量开支。单掘进一项，按每个掘进小组月进五百公尺计算，光华北区国营煤矿一九五二年就可节省价值八千七百二十二吨小米的财富。
