Supporting the Convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference
——Summary of Readers' Letters

Many readers wrote to this newspaper, supporting the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference initiated by eleven individuals in our country dedicated to the cause of peace. They unanimously believe that holding the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in the near future is of great significance and is timely.

The Peking University correspondence group wrote: Today, American imperialism is frantically carrying out its plan of expanding armaments and preparing for war, accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism, continuously using inhumane bacteriological weapons on the Korean battlefield and in our Northeast region, and delaying and sabotaging the Korean negotiations. These criminal acts of American imperialism seriously threaten the security of the Asian and Pacific region. Therefore, preparing to convene such a conference to defend peace at this time is what the world's peace-loving people urgently hope for.

Li Chunjiu, a teacher at the Jilin Provincial Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School, and others wrote: We can no longer tolerate the American aggressors' open provocations against the people of the world. The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is urgently needed.

Han Xingquan and others from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China wrote: The peace conference will undoubtedly give the war-mongers' conspiracy to launch war a powerful blow. We feel extremely excited and encouraged about the convening of this conference.

Readers expressed their determination to defend world peace in their letters.

Wu Mingsheng from Yenching University wrote: We keep in mind Comrade Stalin's words: "If the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."

Zhang Tianzhen of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China wrote: The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing is an honor for the people of our country; we, united with the peace-loving people of Asian and Pacific coastal countries, will surely smash all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism in the Far East.

Readers also unanimously wished the Asian and Pacific coastal countries peace conference a great victory.
