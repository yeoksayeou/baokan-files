Editor's Note: Zhang Shunyou, a cart driver from Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, traveled between the three provinces of Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar, visiting twenty-seven government offices, spending nearly half a year and traveling over 15,000 li, in order to report Song Yude, a counter-revolutionary element in Guisui City. He encountered numerous obstacles and finally filed a complaint with the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, exposing the serious bureaucratic style of work in many of our organs. In order to properly handle this case and to enable leading organs and leading cadres at all levels to deeply learn from this event, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in addition to sending people to the relevant provinces, cities, and departments to verify the facts in detail, also decided to convene all responsible Party member cadres of the agencies involved in this case to the North China Bureau for review. The following is the oral account of Zhang Shunyou himself and Comrade Liu Lantao's reply to Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, regarding this incident.

I am Zhang Shunyou, from Zhuangtou Village, Second District, Guoxian County, Shanxi Province. I am twenty-nine years old this year. I went out to make a living at the age of fourteen and later became a cart driver. When I was a transport worker at the Guisui City Public Mill, I joined the trade union and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Having received revolutionary education, my awareness gradually increased, and I very much support the Communist Party and the People's Government. During the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries last year, I responded to the call of the People's Government and actively reported counter-revolutionary elements.

During my time as a transport worker at the Guisui City Mill, I met the grain dealer Song Yude. At the time, I didn't know that he was a fugitive despotic landlord and murderer. After the mill reduced staff, I started working as a cart driver for Song Yude from March of last year. At that time, the government was suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Song Yude, fearing arrest and punishment, asked me to drive a cart with him from Guisui City to Datong, changed his name to Sun Yude, and wrote two fake travel permits. Song Yude's friend in Datong, fearing trouble, did not allow Song Yude to live there, so he took me to Guoxian County, Shanxi Province. At that time, I suspected that Song Yude must not be a good guy, and I wanted to report him. Firstly, I hated counter-revolutionaries and supported the People's Government; secondly, I thought that if I didn't report him, I would be suspected of harboring a counter-revolutionary. Therefore, after arriving in Guoxian County, I reported the above situation to the village cadres and the Second District Government of Guoxian County. At the end of June last year, the district government arrested Song Yude. After interrogation, no other facts were discovered, and he was released after being detained for ten days. In early July, I returned to Guisui with Song Yude, passing through Datong. At Song Yude's friend's place, I learned that Song Yude was indeed a despotic landlord, so I took my trade union membership card to the Datong County People's Government to report him. The cadres of the Datong County People's Government said, "Without a letter of introduction, the trade union membership card alone cannot be used as a basis, and we don't handle things here." When we returned to Guisui, I thought that since I was a trade union member, the city trade union would definitely handle it, so I went to the city trade union. But the people at the city trade union also said, "We can't handle this, you should go to the police station where Song Yude is located to report him!" I went to the Xiaoxijie Police Station and met the household registration police officer Zhang Li. He also said he wouldn't handle it. I went to the Second District Office, and they also didn't handle it. Later, I went to the Guisui City People's Government, and someone came out from the reception room and said they wouldn't handle it either. Helpless, I thought that the police station where Song Yude was located was under the leadership of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, so I went to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau to report him. The comrades of the Second Branch said, "You came here to report him, first, you don't have a letter of introduction, and second, we haven't found any materials on Song Yude here, so we can't handle it." They also said, "Have a dispute with Song Yude! After a dispute, go to the police station and then to us for handling." After listening to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, I had a dispute with Song Yude and went to the police station to report: "Song Yude is a despotic landlord, changing his name and surname, and opening fake travel permits." I also brought up the fact that Song Yude owed me 750,000 yuan in wages and was trying to fire me, and asked for a resolution. After the police station cadres called and asked the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau for instructions, they said to me, "This is a civil case, a wage dispute, we can't handle it here, you should go to the City People's Court!" In early August, I went to the City People's Court and met the court cadre Wang Shenwu. I told him that Song Yude was a counter-revolutionary element. Wang Shenwu replied, "I don't care if he is a counter-revolutionary or not, you are here to ask for wages, so just talk about the wages!" At this time, Wang Shenwu pulled Song Yude outside the courtyard to talk for a while (it is estimated that Wang Shenwu must have taken a bribe), and when he came back, he threatened me, saying, "You say he owes you money, but you owe him millions! What exactly do you do? We can't resolve it here, you should go to Guoxian County, Shanxi Province to resolve it!" I returned to Guoxian County, obtained a certificate from the village and district governments, and took the materials that the district government suspected and interrogated Song Yude with, and returned to the Guisui City Court, where I met Wang Shenwu. He said, "Song Yude is not at home now, so we can't handle it. You just say he's a counter-revolutionary, but there are no facts." I asked him to give these materials to the president to take a look, but he threatened me again, saying, "These materials of yours are wrong, and you have to take full responsibility!" Later, I went to the Guisui City Trade Union and the City Labor Bureau, but they both shirked responsibility. The Labor Bureau cadres said, "Even the court can't resolve it, so we can't resolve it even more." Helpless, I disguised myself as someone buying alkali and went to Song Yude's original residence, Dongshuidi Village, Fourth District, Yanggao County, Chahar Province, to investigate his crimes. I investigated in Dongshuidi Village and nearby villages for half a month, and visited the mother of Sun Linyu, who was killed by Song Yude, confirming that Song Yude was a fugitive despotic landlord, nicknamed "Third Master Song." He had two sons, both of whom produced noodle ingredients. The eldest son, Song Fujin, was a special agent captain in the Datong puppet police force (and has been executed by the government); the second son, Song Fuduo, was the leader of the Jiugongdao sect. When Yanggao County was liberated in 1948, Song Yude ran to Datong City (which was not yet liberated), relying on enemy forces to beat Sun Linyu from the village to death and break the leg of a man named Dai from the village. After learning about these materials, I went to the Fourth District Office of Yanggao County to report him. The attitude of the Fourth District Office was okay, and they wrote a letter introducing me to the Yanggao County People's Court. The court said that this was a matter of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, not a civil case, and introduced me to the Public Security Bureau for resolution. The Yanggao County Public Security Bureau not only did not resolve it, but also detained the letter of introduction written by the Fourth District. After my repeated requests, they only allowed writing an official letter to the Guisui City Public Security Bureau. But when I went to the Guisui City Court, police station, and Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, they all excused themselves by saying that Yanggao County had not sent an official letter and did not handle it. Helpless, I went from Guisui to the Yanbei Public Security Office, and the cadres of the office said, "As long as there is a letter of introduction from Guoxian County, we can help you resolve it." I returned to my county and, with introductions from the village, district, and Guoxian County Public Security Bureau, went to the Yanbei Public Security Office. The Yanbei Public Security Office introduced me to the Suiyuan Provincial Public Security Department, and the Public Security Department introduced me to the Guisui City Public Security Bureau. The City Public Security Bureau instructed the Second Branch, and the Second Branch instructed the police station to arrest the counter-revolutionary Song Yude on October 31st of last year. I was very happy. But I didn't expect that when the Fourth Section of the Guisui City Public Security Bureau escorted Song to the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau, they put handcuffs on Song and also put handcuffs on me. After arriving at the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau, they also detained me in prison for two hours. I was very dissatisfied.

In order to report the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude, I ran to twenty-seven government offices in Suiyuan, Chahar, and Shanxi for five months, not only delaying production, but also completely selling all my past savings, clothes, quilts, and tobacco pouches. When I really had no money, I stole food from home to sell for travel expenses, totaling 2.4 million yuan without my parents' knowledge. After the counter-revolutionary element was arrested, I asked the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau to have the counter-revolutionary element compensate me for the travel expenses incurred and repay the 750,000 yuan owed to me in wages. The Yanggao County Public Security Bureau said that it could not be resolved here and told me to return to Guisui for resolution. I returned to Guisui City, and the City Public Security Bureau introduced me to the City Court. Comrade Li of the court said, "This problem has been dragging on for too long, and the counter-revolutionary element is not here, so it can't be resolved." Later, I went to the Labor Bureau, and the Labor Bureau introduced me back to the court. After court mediation and judgment, Song Yude paid 500,000 yuan of the 750,000 yuan owed in wages. But the travel expenses incurred could not be resolved. The Guisui City Public Security Bureau introduced me to the Yanbei Public Security Office, and the Public Security Office introduced me to the Guisui City Public Security Bureau. Neither was resolved. Helpless, I returned to my hometown, Guoxian County, Shanxi, and took the official letter from the county Public Security Bureau to Guisui City again. But the City Public Security Bureau, City Court, and City Government did not care. When I went to the Suiyuan Provincial Procuratorate, they didn't even let me in the door. Finally, the First Section of the Suiyuan Provincial Public Security Department wrote me a letter of introduction and told me to go to the Xinxian Prefectural Office in Shanxi for resolution. With the letter of introduction, I first went to the Guoxian County Trade Union, and later to the Xinxian Prefectural Office, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, the Provincial People's Questioning Office, the Provincial Supervision Commission, and the Provincial Procuratorate, but none of them resolved it. At this time, I asked the Shanxi Provincial People's Government to allow me to appeal to the Central People's Government. They said, "This small matter doesn't require you to go there, we will help you resolve it." They introduced me to the Guoxian County Public Security Bureau for resolution. The Public Security Bureau said that it could not be resolved and had to be resolved by the Provincial People's Government. So I returned to the Shanxi Provincial People's Government for the second time, and they told me to return to Guoxian County for resolution. The cadres of the Guoxian County Public Security Bureau said, "We can't resolve it because we are currently carrying out the Three-Anti Campaign." In order to have the counter-revolutionary element compensate for the travel expenses and the wages owed, I ran to twenty-one government offices again. The above back and forth took a total of more than five months, going to Guisui four times and Taiyuan twice, traveling a distance of more than 15,000 li. Finally, when there was no other way, I came to the North China Bureau to appeal.

My demands and hopes: I believe that the People's Government is a government that works for the broad masses of the working people: such as the Fourth District Office of Yanggao County, Chahar Province, and the village cadres of Dongshuidi Village, Fourth District, Yanggao County, such as Song Zengai, some of them had a very good attitude, and some helped resolve travel expenses when I was in difficulty. With their help, I finally completed the task of reporting the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude. But there are also some bureaucratic agencies that shirk responsibility and are irresponsible. I am most dissatisfied with the Guisui City People's Court and the Guisui City Public Security Bureau, especially Wang Shenwu, an intern worker at the Guisui City Court (a member of the Sanqing Corps and the Comrades Association, a fugitive landlord, who has now been expelled). Not only did he not support my actions in reporting the counter-revolutionary element, but he also threatened me and shielded Song Yude. The Guisui City Public Security Bureau not only had a bad attitude, but also handcuffed me while escorting the counter-revolutionary element Song Yude to Yanggao, and even detained me in prison when I arrived at the Yanggao County Public Security Bureau. I request that their mistakes be published in the newspaper, so that they can publicly review their mistakes, educate them to correct their mistakes, and better serve the people. In addition, I request that Song compensate me for the travel expenses incurred of more than 2.4 million yuan and make up for the outstanding wages of 250,000 yuan.

    我检举反革命分子时遭遇了重重阻难
    赶车工人  张顺有口述
    华北局纪律检查委员会  李恒英笔录
    编者按：山西省崞县赶车工人张顺有为了检举归绥市反革命分子宋郁德，曾奔走于绥远、山西、察哈尔三省间的二十七个机关，费时将近半年，行程一万五千多里，遭遇了重重阻难，最后到中共中央华北局进行控诉，揭发了我们许多机关严重的官僚主义作风。中共中央华北局为了正确地处理这个案件，并使各级领导机关和领导干部深刻接受这一事件的教训，除了派人前往有关各省市各部门详细查对事实以外，并决定调集所有与此案有关的各机关负责的党员干部到华北局进行检查。下面是张顺有本人的口述材料和刘澜涛同志关于这一事件给中华全国总工会秘书长赖若愚同志的复信。
    我叫张顺有，山西省崞县二区庄头村人，今年二十九岁，十四岁出外谋生，后当赶车工人。我在归绥市公营碾磨厂当运输员时，加入工会和中苏友好协会，受到革命的教育，觉悟逐渐提高，我对共产党和人民政府非常拥护。去年镇压反革命运动时，我就响应人民政府号召，积极地检举反革命分子。
    我在归绥市碾磨厂当运输员期间，认识了粮贩宋郁德。当时还不知道他是逃亡恶霸地主杀人犯。碾磨厂减员后，我便从去年三月开始，给宋郁德当赶大车的工人。当时政府正在镇压反革命。宋郁德因怕被逮捕法办，要我和他每人赶着一辆大车从归绥市搬到大同，并改名孙郁德，还写了两个假路条。宋郁德在大同的朋友怕受累，不让宋郁德居住，他就又带着我搬到山西省崞县。当时我怀疑宋郁德一定不是个好家伙，心想检举他。一来我痛恨反革命，拥护人民政府；二来我想如果不检举他，自己就有包庇反革命的嫌疑。因此，到崞县以后，我就把上述情形向本村干部和崞县二区区政府报告了。去年六月底，区政府把宋郁德逮捕了。经过审问，没问出其他事实，扣押了十几天就释放了。七月初，我同宋郁德返回归绥，路过大同，在宋郁德的朋友处了解到宋郁德确实是个恶霸地主，我就带着我的工会会员证到大同县人民政府检举他。大同县人民政府的干部说：“没有介绍信，光工会会员证不能作根据，我们这里不管。”我们回到归绥时，我想我是工会会员，市工会一定给办，就到了市工会。但市工会的人也说：“我们管不了，你到宋郁德所在地的派出所去检举吧！”我又到小西街派出所，见到了户籍警张礼。他也说不管。到二区区公所，又不管。后来又到归绥市人民政府，传达室出来一个人，也说不管。没有办法，我想到宋郁德所在地派出所受公安二分局领导，就又去公安二分局检举。二分局的同志说：“你来这里检举他，第一没有介绍信，第二我们这里没发现宋郁德的材料，所以也不能管。”并说：“你和宋郁德起个纠纷吧！起了纠纷，经过派出所再到我们这里处理。”我听了公安二分局的话，就和宋郁德起了纠纷，到派出所去告：“宋郁德是恶霸地主，改名换姓，开假路条。”并且把宋郁德欠我工资七十五万元，企图解雇我的事，也同时提出来，要求解决。派出所的干部打电话请示了公安二分局以后，对我说：“你们这是民事案件，工资纠纷问题，我们这里管不了，你还是到市人民法院吧！”八月初，我到市人民法院，见了法院干部王申午。我告诉他宋郁德是反革命分子。王申午答复说：“反革命不反革命我不管，你反正是为了要工资就说要工资的事吧！”这时王申午把宋郁德拉到院外谈了一下（估计王申午一定受了贿），回来便威胁我说：“你说人家欠你钱，你还欠人家几百万哩！你究竟是干什么的？我们这里解决不了，你到山西省崞县去解决吧！”我就回到崞县，经村、区政府写了证明，并把区政府扣押宋郁德时所怀疑和审问的材料拿着，返回归绥市法院，见了王申午。他说：“宋郁德现在不在家，无法处理。你光说他是反革命，没有事实也不行。”我请他把这些材料交给院长看看，他又威吓我说：“你这些材料错了，你得负完全责任！”后来我到归绥市工会，市劳动局，也都推诿不管。劳动局的干部说：“法院还解决不了哩，我们更不能解决。”没办法，我就装扮成买碱的，到宋郁德原籍察哈尔省阳高县四区东水地村调查他的罪恶材料。前后在东水地村和附近各村调查了半个月，并且访问了被宋郁德杀害的孙林雨的母亲，肯定了宋郁德是逃亡恶霸地主，外号叫“宋三爷”。他有两个儿子，都制造过料面。大儿子宋福金曾在大同伪警宪队当特务队长（已被政府枪决）；次子宋福多是九宫道道首。一九四八年阳高县解放时，宋郁德跑到大同城里（当时未解放），依仗敌势，将本村人孙林雨打死，还将本村一个姓戴的腿打断。我了解到这些材料后，就到阳高县四区区公所去检举他。四区区公所态度还好，并写信把我介绍到阳高县人民法院。法院说这是镇压反革命的问题，并非民事案件，又介绍到公安局解决。阳高县公安局不但不解决，反而把四区写的介绍信扣留不给了。经过我再三要求，才允许给归绥市公安局写公函。但我到归绥市法院、派出所、公安二分局时，他们都藉口说阳高县没来公函，不管。没办法，我又从归绥找到雁北公安办事处，办事处的干部说：“只要有崞县的介绍信，我们就可以帮助你解决。”我就又回到本县，经村、区和崞县公安局介绍到雁北公安办事处。雁北公安办事处又介绍到绥远省公安厅，公安厅又介绍到归绥市公安局，市公安局指示二分局，二分局指示派出所，在去年十月三十一日才把反革命分子宋郁德逮捕起来。我心里非常喜欢。可是我没想到归绥市公安局第四科在押送宋犯到阳高县公安局时，给宋犯带上了手铐，给我也带上了手铐。到阳高县公安局后，也把我扣押到监狱里两个钟头。我非常不满意。
    我为了检举反革命分子宋郁德，奔跑了绥远、察哈尔、山西的二十七个机关，经过五个月，不仅耽误了生产，而且把过去的积蓄和衣服、被子、烟袋等都完全卖光了。实在没钱时，瞒着我父母，从家里偷出粮食来卖掉作路费，共化了二百四十多万元。当把反革命分子逮捕后，我就要求阳高县公安局叫反革命分子赔偿我所化的路费和偿还所欠我的工资七十五万元。阳高县公安局说这里解决不了，叫我回归绥解决。我返回归绥市，市公安局又介绍到市法院。法院李同志说：“这个问题拖的时间太长，反革命分子又不在此地，所以解决不了。”后来我到劳动局，劳动局又把我介绍回法院。经过法院调解判决，宋郁德所欠七十五万元的工资给了五十万元。但往返所化路费还是不能解决。归绥市公安局把我介绍到雁北公安办事处，公安办事处又把我介绍到归绥市公安局。都没有给解决，没办法，我又返回原籍山西崞县公安局，拿本县公安局的公函又到了归绥市。但市公安局、市法院、市政府都不管。到绥远省检察署时，连门都不叫进。最后绥远省公安厅第一处给我写了介绍信，叫去山西忻县专署解决。我拿着介绍信先到崞县县工会，后来又到忻县专署，山西省人民政府，省人民问事处，省监察委员会，省检察署等机关，也都没有给解决。这时我就向山西省人民政府要求到中央人民政府控告。他们说：“这点小事用不着到那里去，我们帮助解决。”他们把我介绍到崞县公安局解决。公安局说解决不了，得由省人民政府解决。我于是第二次返回山西省人民政府，他们又叫我回崞县解决。崞县公安局的干部说：“现正值开展三反运动，我们没办法解决。”为叫反革命分子赔偿路费和所欠工资，我又跑了二十一个机关。以上来回奔跑，一共费了五个多月的时间，四下归绥，两去太原，奔走路程一万五千多里。最后，在没办法时，我才来到华北局控诉。
    我的要求和希望：我相信人民政府是为广大劳动人民办事的政府：如察哈尔省阳高县四区区公所，阳高县四区东水地村村干部宋增爱等，有的态度很好，有的在我困难时帮助解决路费。在他们帮助之下，使我终于完成了检举反革命分子宋郁德的任务。但也有些官僚主义机关，推来推去，不负责任。我最不满意的是归绥市人民法院和归绥市公安局，特别是归绥市法院的实习工作员王申午（系三青团、同志会分子、逃亡地主，现已被开除）。他对我检举反革命分子的行动不但不支持，反而威胁我，包庇宋郁德。归绥市公安局不但态度不好，而且在押解反革命分子宋郁德去阳高的路上，给我也带上了手铐，到阳高县公安局时连我也押到监狱里。对他们这些错误，我要求登报，让他们公开进行检讨，教育他们改正错误，更好地为人民服务。另外，我要求叫宋犯补偿我往返所化路费二百四十余万元，补齐下欠的工资二十五万元。
