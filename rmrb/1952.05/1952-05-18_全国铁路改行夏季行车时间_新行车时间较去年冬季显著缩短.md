    National Railways Change to Summer Timetable
    New Timetable Significantly Shorter Than Last Winter's

    The national railway passenger trains have switched to the summer timetable starting May 16th. On the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement, the work efficiency of railway departments has been improved, so the new timetable is significantly shorter compared to last winter's timetable. For example, the No. 1 express passenger train between Beijing and Manzhouli departs from Beijing Station at 8:00 AM and arrives in Manzhouli at 5:50 AM on the third day, which is three hours and forty-six minutes shorter than the old time. The No. 5 express passenger train between Beijing and Shanghai departs from Beijing at 9:40 PM and arrives in Shanghai at 6:45 AM on the third day, which is one hour and fifteen minutes shorter than the old time. The No. 7 express passenger train between Beijing and Hankou departs from Beijing at 12:50 PM and arrives in Hankou at 7:19 PM on the second day, which is two hours and seventeen minutes shorter than the old time. The No. 9 express passenger train between Shanghai and Guangzhou departs from Shanghai at 6:25 PM and arrives in Guangzhou at 10:11 AM on the third day, which is fifty-five minutes shorter than the old time. Detailed timetables have now been announced at each station. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国铁路改行夏季行车时间
    新行车时间较去年冬季显著缩短
    全国铁路旅客列车自五月十六日起改行夏季行车时刻。在“三反”运动胜利的基础上，铁路各部门工作效率提高，所以新的行车时间和去年冬季的行车时间比较，显著缩短。如北京、满洲里间的一次旅客快车，北京站的开车时间是八点，到满洲里时间是第三天的五点五十分，比旧时间缩短了三小时四十六分；北京、上海间的五次旅客快车，北京的开车时间是二十一点四十分，到上海时间是第三天的六点四十五分，比旧时间缩短了一小时十五分；北京、汉口间的七次旅客快车，北京的开车时间是十二点五十分，到汉口时间是第二天的十九点十九分，比旧时间缩短了二小时十七分；上海、广州间的九次旅客快车，上海的开车时间是十八点二十五分，到广州时间是第三天的十点十一分，比旧时间缩短了五十五分。详细行车时刻现已在各车站公布。　（新华社）
