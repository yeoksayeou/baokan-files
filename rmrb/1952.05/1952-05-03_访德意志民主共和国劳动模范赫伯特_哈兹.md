    Visiting Herbert Hatz, Labor Model of the German Democratic Republic
    On April 27th, the representatives of the trade union delegation from the German Democratic Republic, who were invited to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, were busy from 8:30 in the morning until after 10:00 in the evening without a break. However, when the reporter asked Herbert Hatz at 10:15 p.m. whether he would like to change the time of the interview, he said, "I am not tired at all. I am very happy to talk to you."
    Herbert Hatz is a labor model of the German Democratic Republic, a member of the Presidium of the Free German Metalworkers' Union, and a painter at the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory (state-owned factory). Before coming to China, Herbert Hatz had a strong interest in New China. He had read many newspapers and books introducing China and had a considerable understanding of China. Now, he has come to China and visited famous scenic spots and historical sites such as the Temple of Heaven, Beihai Park, and the Forbidden City, and visited schools such as Tsinghua University and the Attached Women's Middle School of the Normal University. He has many impressions. He said:
    "Although I have read some introductions about China in my country and have some understanding of China, it is far less profound than what I have learned in the past few days." He praised our young generation enthusiastically, saying, "When I visited Tsinghua University, I felt that your students have a very high level. They are constantly studying, which is admirable."
    Herbert Hatz enthusiastically talked about his work experience, over and over again. He hoped that his experience could be introduced to the Chinese workers.
    In 1912, Herbert Hatz was born in a worker's family in Saxony, Germany. After finishing elementary school, he learned the skills of bricklayer and painter. After World War II, Herbert Hatz went to work in the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory (state-owned factory), and soon led a team specializing in painting carriages. To commemorate the unbreakable friendship between the German and Soviet people, the team named itself the "German-Soviet Friendship Team." In the factory's successive production competitions, Herbert Hatz played a pioneering role. Therefore, in 1949, the Free German Trade Union Federation awarded him the honorary title of "Activist."
    In 1950, the government of the German Democratic Republic awarded the honors of "Activist Meritorious Worker" and "Excellent Quality Team" to Herbert Hatz and his team, respectively, and awarded them a bonus of one thousand marks. This was because: Herbert Hatz put forward seven rationalization proposals in 1950, improved the quality of work, and saved a lot of time. His team had eight people, and they could save the country 5,000 hours a year. To give a simple example: in the past, when they painted carriages, in order to avoid getting paint on the glass, they would first apply a layer of medicine on the glass for protection; after the carriage was painted, they would scrape off the medicine and paint together, but they often scratched the glass. Herbert Hatz invented a medicine. After applying this medicine to the glass and then painting, when scraping it off, the medicine and paint would be scraped off in one piece, and the glass would not be damaged at all, saving time. Herbert Hatz promoted these experiences to the team, the workshop, and organized four teams in the painting department to start a competition. As a result of the competition, three teams won the honorary title of "Excellent Quality Team." Herbert Hatz also often went to various factories to give reports, promoting experience and enlivening the competitions in those factories.
    In January 1951, the German Socialist Unity Party put forward the first five-year plan to the working people. Herbert Hatz enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and drew up his own "five-year plan," one of which was: to increase work efficiency by 72 percent in five years. In this way, he studied the Kovalev working method and implemented it. In the past, when one person painted the metal plate under the carriage window, it took four and a half to five hours for one carriage. Herbert Hatz suggested that two people cooperate, so that two people together took only two hours and ten minutes. Under the suggestion and promotion of Herbert Hatz, thirteen teams in the factory adopted the Kovalev working method, which increased the factory's production volume by 12 percent. With the assistance of the trade union, he also organized seventy-five study groups, where advanced workers taught and organized everyone to study in their spare time. Therefore, the quality of work in the factory was greatly improved, and the painting department became a department with excellent quality. On October 13, 1951, Herbert Hatz was awarded the honorary title of Labor Hero by the state and received a bonus of 10,000 marks.
    Soon after this, he was elected as a member of the Presidium of the Free German Metalworkers' Union.

    访德意志民主共和国劳动模范赫伯特·哈兹
    四月二十七日这一天，德意志民主共和国应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的工会代表团的代表们，从早晨八点半起床后，一直忙到晚间十点多钟，就没有休息过。但是当晚间十点十五分钟，记者问赫伯特·哈兹是否把访问的时间改变一下时，他说：“我毫不疲劳，我非常高兴和你谈话。”
    赫伯特·哈兹是德意志民主共和国的劳动模范、自由德国五金工会主席团的委员、火车头火车厢制造厂（国营工厂）的油漆工人。在来到我国以前，赫伯特·哈兹就对新中国感到浓厚的兴趣，他曾看过不少关于介绍中国的报纸、书籍，对中国有相当的了解。现在，他已来到中国并且游览了天坛、北海、故宫等名胜古迹，参观了清华大学、师范大学附属女子中学等学校，他的感想是很多的。他说：
    “我在国内虽然看了些介绍中国的东西，对中国有
    一些了解，但远不如这几天内了解得深刻。”他极力赞美我们年青的一代说：“我参观清华大学时，觉得你们的学生有着很高的水平，他们不断地钻研学问，这是值得敬佩的。”
    赫伯特·哈兹热情地讲述着他的工作经验，一遍又一遍，他希望他的经验能够有机会介绍给中国的工人兄弟。
    一九一二年，赫伯特·哈兹出生在德国萨克森省
    一个工人的家里，读完小学后，他就学会了泥水匠和油漆匠的手艺。第二次大战后，赫伯特·哈兹就到了火车头火车厢制造厂（国营工厂）去工作，不久，就领导一个小组专门油漆车厢。为了纪念德苏人民牢不可破的友谊，小组自己取名叫做“德苏友谊组”。在工厂历次的生产竞赛中，赫伯特·哈兹都起着先锋作用，所以，一九四九年，自由德国工会联合会就奖给他“积极分子”的光荣称号。
    一九五零年，德意志民主共和国政府把“积极分子功臣”和“质量优良小组”的荣誉分别奖给赫伯特·哈兹和他的小组，并发给他们奖金一千马克。这是因为：赫伯特·哈兹在一九五零年一年中提出了七件合理化建议，改进了工作的质量，并节省了很多的时间，他的小组有八个人，每年就可给国家节省五千个小时。举一个简单的例子：过去他们在油漆车厢时，为避免把油漆涂到玻璃上弄不下来，都是先在玻璃上抹一层药剂作保护；把车厢油好后，再把玻璃上的药剂连油漆一起刮下来，但还是常常把玻璃刮坏了。赫伯特·哈兹就发明了一种药品，把这药品涂上玻璃后再油漆，然后再往下刮，连药剂带油漆一整片就刮下来了，玻璃丝毫不受损伤，又节省了时间。赫伯特·哈兹把这些经验推广到小组、车间，并组织了油漆部内四个小组展开竞赛，竞赛的结果是：三个小组获得了“最优良质量小组”的光荣称号。赫伯特·哈兹又时常到各工厂去作报告，推广经验，使那些工厂的竞赛活跃起来。
    一九五一年一月，德国统一社会党向劳动人民提出了第一个五年计划。赫伯特·哈兹热烈地响应了党的号召，订出了他自己的“五年计划”，其中一条是：五年后，把工作效率提高百分之七十二。这样，他就钻研了郭瓦廖夫工作法，加以实行。过去一个人油漆车厢窗户下的金属板子时，一辆车需用四小时半到五小时，赫伯特·哈兹提议由两个人分工合作，这样，两个人一共才用两小时零十分钟。在赫伯特·哈兹的建议和推动之下，全厂有十三个组采用了郭瓦廖夫的工作方法，使整个工厂的生产量提高了百分之十二。在工会协助下，他并组织了七十五个学习小组，由先进工人在业余时间教课、组织大家学习。因此，就使全厂工作质量大大提高，油漆部也就成为质量优良的一个部门。一九五一年十月十三日，赫伯特·哈兹就得到国家颁给的劳动英雄的光荣称号，并得到了奖金一万马克。
    这以后不久，他就当选为自由德国五金工会主席团的委员。
