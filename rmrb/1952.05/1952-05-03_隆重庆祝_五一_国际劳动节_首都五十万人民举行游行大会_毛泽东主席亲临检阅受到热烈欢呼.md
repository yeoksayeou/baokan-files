From afar, they looked enthusiastically at the rostrum, raised their little hands, and cheered Long Live Chairman Mao and Long Live Stalin. As they passed in front of the rostrum, they held up lettered signs and bouquets of flowers that formed various slogans. They jumped and cheered in front of the rostrum. One team released a flock of pigeons, and another team held up models of airplanes. The children of New China used these to express their firm will to defend the motherland and world peace.

Two members emerged from the marching Young Pioneers and walked to the rostrum to present flowers to Chairman Mao on behalf of the people of the capital, expressing the boundless love and gratitude of the people of Beijing and all of China for their great leader. At this moment, the entire audience resounded with thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers.

The workers cheered Chairman Mao and Stalin, cheered the great motherland and Sino-Soviet friendship, and cheered the powerful strength of the Communist Party of China and the people of the world. They shouted loudly for the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and shouted to smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. These workers of New China have been fighting the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns for the past few months while maintaining production. They have achieved victories on all fronts simultaneously. They carried charts and models to show their production achievements and this year's production increase and savings plans. Railway workers carried huge models of locomotives and bridges, with signs stating the achievements of exceeding production tasks in April and proposing a guarantee to meet the "full load, over-axle, 500 kilometers" campaign. Charts from workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant showed that their output in the first quarter of this year increased more than twofold compared with the same period last year, and their costs were reduced by 8.51% compared to the original plan. They prepared to reduce costs by another 5% of the original plan in the Red May competition. Workers from the Jingxi Coal Mine, wearing coal miner's hats, marched holding wind picks. In their production competition to welcome the "May Day" holiday, one team created a new record of 27 meters of coal lane excavation in one day on April 25. Charts from workers at the Liulihe Cement Plant showed that they completed their first quarter production plan five days ahead of schedule and created 96 new production records during the "Three-Anti" campaign. Construction workers marched carrying models of advanced bricklaying methods, expressing their will to build the people's capital at high speed. Workers from the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory made concrete guarantees on the charts they carried, promising to supply the countryside with a large number of new-style agricultural implements. These brilliant achievements and goals of the workers brought great excitement to the audience.

Representatives of 15,000 farmers from the capital's suburbs on the patriotic production front, dressed in new clothes, marched forward cheering. Behind the agricultural labor models wearing medals, male and female farmers held up huge signs: "Organize, improve technology, and strive to increase per-unit area yield." Some farmers carried large models and charts of various major crops. The charts stated that the goal of the farmers in the Beijing suburbs in the 1952 patriotic production increase movement was to increase production by 10%. They held up signs, guaranteeing that the total output of various crops this year, converted into corn, would reach 310 million jin. The charts showed that in order to achieve this goal, they organized 2,432 mutual aid teams; tens of thousands of farmers are currently engaged in a tense struggle to prevent and control pests. The whole audience applauded warmly, wishing them victory.

The contingent of more than 60,000 students and teachers from universities and middle schools was led by 3,500 male and female athletes. Many of these athletes were athletes from all over the country. The students were divided into many teams, each with its own characteristics. There was a large statue of Chairman Mao in the procession, surrounded by female students in red clothes forming a five-pointed red star. There was a large model of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and large characters calling for the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which combines it with Chinese practice. The students shouted Long Live Chairman Mao, Long Live Stalin, and shouted against American imperialism. The whole audience responded with warm applause.

While the student contingent was marching, representatives of the Central South Nationalities Institute walked to the rostrum to present a flag to Chairman Mao as a tribute.

The contingent of 250,000 people from various districts of Beijing followed, including employees of small and medium-sized public and private factories and private shops. The workers and shop assistants in private enterprises achieved victory in the "Five-Anti" campaign and raised their awareness, so they were unprecedentedly excited and encouraged today. There were also many housewives and white-haired elderly people in the crowd.

There were also 12,000 Beijing industrialists and businessmen in the parade. They shouted slogans expressing their determination to follow the path of the Common Program under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, and strive to develop economic undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

The contingent of 4,500 literary and art workers was led by famous writers Lao She, Li Bozhao, and Cao Yu. The literary and art contingent performed dances from various ethnic groups and regions while marching.

The Hungarian National People's Cultural Troupe participated in the literary and art parade. They performed spur dances, bottle dances, and gift dances in front of the rostrum, and sang "The East is Red" in Chinese. After the performance, six members, accompanied by Hong Shen, Director of the Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council, walked to the rostrum to present a flag and gifts to Chairman Mao on behalf of the Hungarian state and people. The audience repeatedly erupted in enthusiastic applause and cheers.

Every column of parading people enthusiastically paid tribute to the representatives of the working class of various countries and other guests as they passed in front of the viewing platform.

The entire parade passed the rostrum at 1:10 p.m. At this time, the military band, government employees, and Young Pioneers in the southern part of the square advanced to the front of the rostrum, cheering and applauding Chairman Mao for a long time.

At 1:30 p.m., Chairman Mao walked to the eastern and western edges of the Tiananmen gate tower and frequently waved to the foreign guests on the viewing platform and the staff of the central government in the square. At this moment, applause thundered throughout the audience, and the cheers reached their climax.
