Further Understanding of American Bacteriological Warfare After Talking with American Prisoners of War
Chen Shixiang, Director of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

As an entomologist, I participated in the joint interrogation team organized by Korean and Chinese experts and journalists and conducted several interrogations of American bacteriological warfare prisoners of war, Inoc and Quinn. In these interviews, both prisoners of war gave very clear and specific accounts of their bacteriological warfare training and the circumstances under which they were ordered to drop bacteriological bombs. The facts they confessed not only make it impossible for the American aggressors to deny or disclaim them, but also enable us to gain a greater understanding of the inside story of the preparation for and launching of this bacteriological warfare. What is particularly noteworthy is that these confessed facts, on the one hand, are consistent with the evidence we have discovered in Korea and China, and on the other hand, they can also corroborate the aggressors' cunning actions of spreading bacteria while lying. Here, I would like to explain two points regarding insects.

1.  The testimonies of the two prisoners of war confirm that the United States has made great "developments" in bacteriological warfare research through long-term and active efforts: there are many types of bacteriological weapons, and the methods of spreading them are extremely vicious and insidious. In terms of insects, almost any kind can be used to spread bacteria, and there are no restrictions on time and place. For example, Quinn confessed that the lecturer Ashforth said: "The research on bacteriological warfare has opened up an infinite field..." In terms of insects, "almost any insect can be used to spread bacteria," and insects "can be selected and cultivated to be cold-resistant and can live for a long time without eating." "Bacteria can be spread by a variety of different insects and rodents, which have been cultivated for several generations under laboratory conditions and selected to survive at any time, any place, even under the most unfavorable conditions." Inoc confessed that Wilson also explained that "flies, fleas, mosquitoes, lice, and many other insects can be used to spread bacteria." What these two bacteriological warfare training lecturers said is very important. On the one hand, their content is basically consistent; on the other hand, it is also highly consistent with the evidence we have discovered. We have discovered that the bacteria-carrying insects airdropped by the US military, just as Ashforth, who has been researching bacteriological warfare for many years, said, are mostly of the "any insect" type, which are not registered in medical entomology, but they are bacteria-carrying; for example, black flies, black springtails, wolf spiders, etc. Before the bacteriological warfare, no one would have believed that they carried so many germs such as anthrax bacilli, Pasteurella bacilli, dysentery bacilli, and typhoid bacilli, but the American bacteria factories selected them and cultivated them into bacteria-carrying insects as bacteriological warfare weapons. These airdropped insects also appeared at times and places where they should not have appeared. Black flies and wolf spiders in Korea and Northeast China should only be active in the fields in April and May, but in the above-mentioned locations in February and March, in temperatures of minus ten degrees Celsius, they appeared in groups on the snow after American military planes flew over. Mole crickets overwinter as eggs, but after the US air raid in Kuandian, Northeast China, they appeared in batches on the snow; black springtails can be active on snow, water, or in damp places, but strangely, after the American planes passed, these insects were found on the hats and clothes of our soldiers. These are exactly in line with what Ashforth said about "any time, any place."

2.  The testimonies of the two prisoners of war confirm that American bacteriological weapons are spread by various disguised methods. They made the appearance of the bacteriological bombs the same as ordinary five-hundred-pound bombs and called them "non-exploding bombs"; they disguised containers with parachutes (containing bacteria-carrying insects, small animals, or other objects) to resemble flares. Their purpose is obviously to paralyze us, making it difficult to detect, and even if discovered, they can use this to quibble and deny—this is exactly the farce they are currently playing. This disguised method is also extremely obvious in terms of insects. We can see that the camouflage they used to spread bacteria-carrying insects mainly takes three forms: First, they try to use species that are not often considered medical insects as much as possible. These species can both paralyze our inspection and serve as a basis for quibbling and denial. Listen, aren't entomologists on the other side of the Pacific singing loudly that these insects are completely harmless and absolutely cannot carry bacteria? What is laughable is that we have proven that these insects not only do carry germs, but also more than one type. Second, they try to use widely distributed insects, insects that are found in China, Korea, and other regions. Their intention is also to make it difficult for us to detect, while making it easier for them to deny, and even more shamelessly say that these insects are originally ours, so even if they are airdropped, they will not have much effect on us. Third, they may also use a combination of real and false tactics, spreading some non-bacteria-carrying species or individuals in addition to bacteria-carrying insects to confuse our inspection. For example, mole crickets and stoneflies, we have conclusive evidence that they were spread by the US Air Force, but no germs have been detected so far. These insects are likely to be used as cover.

In short, from all aspects, it can be proven that when the United States planned to use bacteriological weapons, it already had the intention of eliminating evidence and prepared to eliminate evidence,妄想borrowing this to escape the condemnation of righteous people and achieve its goal of killing without bloodshed. However, all these conspiracies are in vain. The facts are very clear. The crime of the United States in launching bacteriological warfare is not only supported by many witnesses and material evidence on our side, but also the American Air Force personnel who personally dropped bacteriological bombs in Korea have confessed to the specific facts. This crime, no matter how cleverly or secretly disguised, is already as solid as a mountain and its true colors are exposed. But on the other hand, their camouflage actions have achieved the goal of partially paralyzing us. The bacteriological warfare launched on January 1 was not discovered by us until four weeks later. Therefore, we can say with certainty that there must be many undiscovered pieces of evidence of American bacteriological warfare, and we must be more vigilant.

Now, the inside story of the American bacteriological warfare has been more clearly and thoroughly exposed by the confessions of bacteriological warfare prisoners of war, Inoc and Quinn. If there are still people in the world who harbor illusions about the American aggressors and doubt their crimes, especially pure scientific workers who may have been deceived by the aggressors' scientific disguises, just as we were initially deceived, now, facing these iron facts, they must be suddenly enlightened. We must call on all pure scientific workers in the world, all peace-loving and justice-upholding people, to jointly stop the atrocities of American bacteriological warfare in order to safeguard scientific dignity and defend world peace.

    和美俘谈话后对于美国发动细菌战的进一步了解
    中国科学院昆虫研究室主任　陈世骧
    我以昆虫学工作者的资格，参加了朝中专家记者所组织的联合讯问团，对美国细菌战俘伊纳克及奎恩，进行了多次讯问。在这些询问的谈话中，两战俘对于他们受细菌战训练的经过和奉命投掷细菌弹的情况，都有很明确很具体的说明。他们所供认的事实，不但使美国侵略者无法否认，无法抵赖，同时也使我们对于这个细菌战的准备内幕，发动情形，得到更多的了解。尤其值得注意的，是这些供认出来的事实，一方面和我们在朝鲜及中国所发见的罪证互相吻合，另方面却又可以和侵略者一面撒菌，一面撒谎的狡猾行动彼此印证。这里仅就有关于昆虫方面的两点，提出说明。
    一、两战俘的供词证实了美国对于细菌战的研究，由于长期地积极地进行，已有极大“发展”：细菌武器种类繁多，撒布方法极尽其毒辣阴险。在昆虫方面，几乎任何种类都可用来传布细菌，并且可以不受时间地点的限制。例如奎恩供称，讲课员阿西福克曾说：“细菌战的研究，已开辟了无限的领域……。”在昆虫方面，“差不多任何虫子都可用来传布细菌”，虫子“经过选择与培养可以耐寒，不吃东西也可以活得很长久”。“细菌可以借多种不同的昆虫和齧齿类的动物而传播，这些昆虫和齧齿类动物是在实验室的条件下培养了好几代，使它们在任何时间任何地点，即使在最不利的条件下都能生存而挑选出来的”。伊纳克供认威尔逊也曾说明“蝇、蚤、蚊、虱及其它许多昆虫都可用来传布细菌”。这两个训练细菌战的讲课员所说的话是十分重要的，一方面，他们的内容是基本一致的；另方面，和我们所发现的罪证也是十分吻合的。我们发现美军空投的带菌昆虫，正如这位研究细菌战已有多年的阿西福克所说，很多是属于“任何昆虫”之类，是医学昆虫学上没有名籍的，但它们却是带菌的；例如黑蝇、黑跳虫、狼蛛等等，在细菌战前，不会相信它们带有那么多的病菌如炭疽杆菌、巴氏杆菌、痢疾杆菌，伤寒杆菌等，而美国的细菌工厂却选中了它们，把它们培养成为带菌的昆虫，作为细菌战的武器。这些空投的昆虫，同时也正是在不该出现的时节，不该出现的地点出现的。黑蝇、狼蛛，在朝鲜和中国东北，应到四五月间，才能在田野活动，但在上述地点二三月间零下十度的气候下，却于美国军用飞机飞过后，都成群地在雪面上出现。油葫芦是以卵过冬的，在东北宽甸美国飞机空袭以后，却成批地在雪面上出现；黑跳虫可以在雪面上、水面上或潮湿的地方活动，但奇怪的是在美国飞机过后，这虫子竟在我们战士的帽子上衣服上发见。这些正是和阿西福克所说的“任何时间任何地点”，完全吻合。
    二、两战俘的供词，证实了美国的细菌武器，是用种种伪装的方法来撒布的。他们把细菌弹的外表，造成和普通的五百磅炸弹一样，并且称之为“不爆炸的炸弹”；他们把带有降落伞的容器（内装带菌的昆虫、小动物或其他物体），装成和照明弹相似。他们的目的，显然以为这样便可使我们麻痹，不易发觉，即使发觉了，也可借此来狡辩抵赖——这正是他们目前所扮演的丑剧。这种伪装的办法，表演在昆虫方面，也是极其明显。我们可以看出，他们撒布带菌昆虫所用的伪装，主要是三种方式：第一是尽量利用经常所不认为是医学昆虫的种类，这些种类既可麻痹我们的检查，又可作为狡辩抵赖的本钱。试听太平洋彼岸的昆虫学者不是正在大唱高调，说这些昆虫完全无害，绝对不能带菌吗？所可笑的是我们已经证明这些虫子，不但确实带有病菌，而且不止一种。第二是尽量利用分布广泛的昆虫，在中国、朝鲜和其它地域都有的昆虫，其居心也是使我们不易发觉，而在他们则易于狡赖，甚至更可无赖地说，这些虫子既是我们所原有的，则即使空投下来，对我们也不会有多大作用。第三也可能用虚虚实实的手段，在带菌昆虫之外，也撒布些不带菌的种类或个体，来混淆我们的检查。例如油葫芦和石蝇，我们有确凿的证据，证明是美国空军所撒布的，但至今尚没有检查出病菌。这些虫子，很可能是他们用来做掩护的。
    总之，从一切方面看，都可证明美国在计划使用细菌武器的时候，便已抱着消灭罪证的企图，进行消灭罪证的准备，妄想借此来逃避正义人士的声讨，而达到其杀人不见血的目的。然而这一切的阴谋是徒劳的，事实已十分明白，美国发动细菌战的罪行，不但是在我们方面有许多人证物证，而亲自在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的美国空军人员，亦已供认了具体的事实。这个罪行，不管它伪装得如何巧妙，如何秘密，已经是铁证如山，原形毕露了。但是反过来说，他们的伪装行动，却已达到了局部麻痹我们的目的。一月一日发动的细菌战，直到四星期以后才被我们发觉。因此，我们可以肯定地说，美国细菌战的罪证，必然有很多尚未发现，我们必须要提高警惕。
    现在，美国发动细菌战的黑幕，已由细菌战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供认，而更明白更彻底地暴露了。世界上如果还有人对美国侵略者抱有幻想的，对他们的罪行表示怀疑的，特别是纯正的科学工作者们，在侵略者的科学伪装下可能曾被蒙蔽，正如我们最初被蒙蔽一样，现在，面对着这些铁的事实，亦必是恍然大悟了。我们要呼吁全世界的一切纯正的科学工作者们，一切爱好和平主持正义的人们，为了维护科学尊严，保卫世界和平，必须共同起来，制止美国细菌战的暴行。
