    Irrefutable Ironclad Evidence
    ——American Air Force Prisoners of War Confess to U.S. Military Germ Warfare
    Zhong Huilan, Doctor of Medicine
    The crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out barbaric germ warfare in Korea and within our own country have been exposed with a great deal of irrefutable human and material evidence by reporters from various countries, the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and the investigation team of the American imperialist germ warfare crimes organized by the people of our country. Fair-minded people around the world have launched stern condemnations against the American aggressors. However, in order to evade punishment, the U.S. imperialists are still shamelessly quibbling. Recently, two American Air Force prisoners of war, who personally underwent training in U.S. imperialist germ warfare and personally dropped germ bombs in Korea, have again provided detailed confessions of their germ warfare operations, once again revealing the towering crimes of the American aggressors to the world.
    These two American Air Force personnel – Enock and Quinn – were captured by our army on January 13 while dropping germ bombs in Korea. After their B-26 aircraft was shot down, they parachuted down in different directions, so they were captured in two different locations. They have not met each other since being captured, but their confessions unanimously and nakedly exposed the criminal facts of how the American aggressors prepared for and carried out germ warfare.
    The service numbers, ages, origins, and qualifications of these two prisoners of war have all been clearly stated by themselves. They had listened to secret lectures given by the American aggressors for carrying out germ warfare, and they also spoke in detail about who attended the lectures, the names of the lecturers, and the content of the lectures. They also spoke in considerable detail about their experiences in dropping germ bombs in Korea. Their authentic American accents can also be heard in the recordings. This confession makes it impossible for the American aggressors to deny the crimes of germ warfare any longer.
    The facts confessed by the American prisoners prove that the investigation materials and scientific judgments of the people of China and Korea and international figures are all correct. For example, their descriptions of the types, structures, and sizes of the germ bombs are completely consistent with some of the germ containers that have been found dropped in China and Korea. They confessed that the types of germs and viruses that the American aggressors may have spread include dysentery, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, typhus, smallpox, yellow fever, acute encephalitis, malaria, etc.; the types of insects that may have been used include lice, fleas, flies, mosquitoes, etc. And all of these things have been discovered by us. In addition, their statements about how U.S. imperialism planned to use various methods to spread germs and viruses are also consistent with what is recorded in relevant U.S. germ warfare documents, and also consistent with the facts that have been discovered in Korea and Northeast China in the past two or three months. These kinds of ironclad evidence, no matter how the American aggressors quibble, cannot be denied.
    One more point that is worth the attention of the people of the world: The confessions of the two American prisoners of war mentioned that they themselves and other American soldiers had been injected with a secret, unrecorded prophylactic vaccine. This shows that the American aggressors are still using a new bacterium or virus to slaughter the people of China and Korea. The people of China and Korea are already highly vigilant about this and are sufficient to defeat any conspiracy of the American aggressors. People all over the world who love peace, unite and strangle the bloody hands of the American aggressors!

    无可辩驳的铁证
    ——美国空军战俘供认美军进行细菌战
    医学博士  钟惠澜
    美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国境内进行野蛮的细菌战的罪行，已由各国记者、国际民主法律工作者协会调查团和我国人民组织的美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团先后揭举出了很多铁一般的人证物证。全世界的公正人士，已对美国侵略者提出了严正的声讨。但是，美帝国主义者为了逃避惩罚，还在那里无耻狡赖。最近，两名亲身受过美帝国主义进行细菌战的训练、亲手在朝鲜投掷过细菌弹的美国空军战俘，又详细地供认了他们进行细菌战的经过，再一次使美国侵略者的滔天罪行大白于天下。
    这两个美国空军人员——伊纳克和奎恩，是一月十三日在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的时候被我军俘获的。他们所驾驶的B二十六型飞机被击落后，他们跳伞降落的方向不同，所以他们是在两个不同的地点被俘的。被俘后他们始终没有见过面，但他们的供词不约而同地都赤裸裸地暴露了美国侵略者如何准备、如何进行细菌战的犯罪事实。
    这两个战俘的军号、年龄、籍贯和资历，都经他们自己说得很清楚。他们曾听过美国侵略者为进行细菌战所开的秘密课，当时一道听讲的有那些人、主讲人的名字和课堂上所讲的内容，也说得很详细。他们在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的经过，也讲得相当详细具体。他们的道地美国口音，也可以从录音中听出来。这个供词，使美国侵略者对细菌战罪行再也无法狡赖了。
    美俘供出的事实，证明了中朝两国人民及国际人士的调查材料和科学判断，都是正确的。例如，他们所说的细菌弹的型式、构造和大小，与已被发现的投在中朝两国境内的一部分细菌容器完全相符。他们所供关于美国侵略者可能撒布的病菌和病毒的种类，包括痢疾、霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒、斑疹伤寒、天花、黄热病、急性脑炎、疟疾等；可能利用的昆虫的种类，包括虱子、跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊子等。而这些东西，都是被我们发现了的。另外，他们所说美帝国主义计划如何利用各种不同方法来撒布病菌病毒的事实，也都与美国有关细菌战的文献中所记载的相符，也与最近两三个月来在朝鲜和我国东北所发现的事实相符。这种种铁的证据，任凭美国侵略者如何狡辩，都是没法赖掉的。
    还有一点是值得全世界人民注意的：两个美俘的供词中，提到他们自己和其他美军都曾注射过一种秘密的、不记录的预防疫苗。这说明美国侵略者还在利用一种新的细菌或病毒来屠杀中朝两国人民。中朝两国人民对此已有高度的警惕，足以击败美国侵略者的任何阴谋诡计。全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，扼住美国侵略者的血手！
