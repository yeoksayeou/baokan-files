Dedicated to Chairman Mao Zedong
— After Attending the “May Day” Celebrations in Beijing —
Hong Chunzhe, Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China
The red and lovable city gate tower faces the beautiful mountains and rivers. At the dawn of victory, the people gaze at the magnificent Tiananmen Square. Amidst the cheers of "Long Live" and the songs of heartfelt love and admiration, there appears the morning sun—You—the great Mao Zedong.

We heard the firm and powerful cry of "Resist America, Aid Korea" on the blood-stained riverbanks and in the places turned into ruins. Because we are with you, we fear no hardship, we fear no difficulty. Every tree, every blade of grass, every stone stands on the side of justice, standing with us for glorious victory.

Towards the road of struggle you have pointed out, towards the road of victory you have pointed out, the hearts of 500 million people, with their blood boiling, are united into one unwavering confidence.

In the pride of victory, there are two countries that will be eternally praised. The banner of a hundred battles, a hundred victories—You, are a raging fire. The 25,000-li Long March has forged an invincible iron force, and this force is today tightly linked with your name, and it also stands firmly on the same front with us.

In Korea, in the deep of the night when nightingales sing, people look up at the North Star, their ears clearly hearing the cry of support from the Chinese people under your leadership, shaking the valleys and flying over the mountains.

The greatest cradle! The torch that aids us! I have seen on the vast land of Asia, shaking off a century of long humiliation, building a bright new country. I have seen the mighty torrent of 500 million people shaking the earth, advancing majestically under your—the sun’s—leadership. I have seen under the red flag with five golden stars shining, factories like forests; fertile, free land stretching as far as the eye can see; chimneys emitting thick smoke with the whistles blaring; grains and local products flowing smoothly and unhindered. I have seen the land overflowing with happiness—a bright future.

I have further seen the honor and pride of a vibrant people, on the road of unity and struggle, casting aside everything old and decadent with the powerful force of struggle and unity; regarding labor as the supreme glory. This is by no means accidental, 500 million people, united under your leadership into an iron bastion. Inspired by your thought, heading towards the glorious road, marching towards victory, forever marching towards victory.

Ah, the great name! As soon as we open our eyes, we think of you, we think of the most intimate heart of support, rising together with the flames of revenge in our hearts in the vigorous Resist America, Aid Korea movement, with a heart full of anger at the enemy; we think of your glorious soldiers who are in the same trenches as us. We don’t know how to thank you enough.

A name that we can be proud of at any time, a name that we can sing praises of at any time—the sun of China—Chairman Mao Zedong. —The torch that aids us—Chairman Mao Zedong.

I want to go back and tell the Korean warriors and the Korean people who are holding high the banner of the great leader of heroic Korea—our torch of a hundred battles, a hundred victories—General Kim Il-sung, who are advancing along the road opened up with blood. Tell them: In the night of myriad lights, from the sea of people holding flowers and celebrating wildly, sing the song of Resist America, Aid Korea, resounding through the heavens and the earth. This country blooming with the flowers of happiness is unfolding a surge of construction.

You are always before our eyes, your name warms our hearts, and those many victories were obtained because of the torch of your support.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong! News of victory continuously blossoms into flowers of victory, and stars of victory sparkle in the Korean sky; the Korean people standing in the ruins, with irrepressible hatred, with firm confidence in victory, sing the battle songs of struggle, bravely annihilating the enemy. —This is the sound of their reply to you.

They, with the serious fighting will of regarding themselves as torpedoes rushing towards the enemy, blocking the enemy's gun muzzles with their own bodies, breaking through the flames of test, crossing the treacherous mountains, present to you—a victory song of triumph, —repaying you with the name of heroes.

The flags of our two countries will forever fly in the eastern sky, above the invincible bastion.

Respected Chairman Mao Zedong, revered by all people! Your name is a spark, your name is a red star, for the victory of the Asian people, for the song of human peace, for the freedom of the two heroic countries, singing praises of you and our glorious revolutionary friendship together, forever glorious, forever radiant!
