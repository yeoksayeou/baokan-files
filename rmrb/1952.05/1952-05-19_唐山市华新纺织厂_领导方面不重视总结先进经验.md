    Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory
    Leadership Fails to Value Summarizing Advanced Experiences
    To the Editor: The leadership of our Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory (joint state-private enterprise) does not value summarizing advanced experiences. Our factory's spinning workshop promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method, which greatly reduced roller waste. For example, Li Fenglan, who watches eighty roving spindles, only produces 4.5 liang of roller waste per day. However, the leadership not only does not summarize her experience and promote it throughout the factory, but also abandons leadership and fails to provide assistance. After the roving workshop established a Hao Jianxiu work method group, it strengthened the cleaning of machines and improved the work of piecing and yarn changing. The end breakage rate of the entire workshop has been greatly reduced. Now all three shifts of workers in the entire workshop have learned and are implementing this method, but the leadership has not studied and summarized it either. The same is true for the promotion of Ren Shulan's yarn end saving method. From the above facts, it can be seen that our factory's leadership has adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the promotion of advanced experiences. We hope they will correct this as soon as possible.

### 唐山市华新纺织厂  领导方面不重视总结先进经验

    唐山市华新纺织厂
    领导方面不重视总结先进经验
    编辑同志：我们唐山市华新纺织厂（公私合营）领导方面不重视总结先进经验。我厂细纱车间推广了郝建秀工作法，大大降低了皮辊花。如李凤兰看八十根绒棍，每天只出皮辊花四点五两。但领导方面不但不总结她的经验，在全厂内加以推广，反而放弃领导，不予帮助。粗纱车间成立郝建秀工作法小组后，加强了机台清洁工作，改进了接头换纱的工作，全车间的断头率大大降低。现在全车间三班工人已全部学会并且已经实行这一方法，但是，领导方面也未研究总结。在推广任淑兰的节约纱头工作法上也是如此。从以上事实，可以看出我厂领导方面对待推广先进经验，是采取了不负责任的态度。希望他们赶快纠正。
