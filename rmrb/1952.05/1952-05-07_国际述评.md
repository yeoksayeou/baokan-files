The Powerful Demonstration of the World's Working People in Defense of Peace

On May 1st, International Labor Day, the working people of all countries held demonstrations and rallies to celebrate their own festival and review their own strength. The powerful demonstrations of the working people of all countries celebrating May Day are the most vivid expression of the firm will of the working people of all countries to defend peace and oppose war. It shows that the brotherly friendship and unity of the working people has been further expanded and strengthened.

From Beijing to Berlin, the working people of the countries of the peace and democracy camp, in the context of new and great victories in defending peace and economic construction, joyfully celebrated their festival. The working people of our country who have achieved great successes on the two fronts of resisting America and aiding Korea and production construction, the working people of the Soviet Union who are carrying out great communist construction, the people of many people's democratic countries who are carrying out socialist construction, and the working people of Korea who are bravely fighting for the liberation of their motherland, all held grand demonstrations and rallies. In the demonstrations, the working people of all countries showed the solidarity of the working class and the firm will to defend peace and invincible strength, and showed their joyful mood of strengthening national economic construction and improving living standards. The strength of the working people of these countries inspires the fighting will of the working people of the world and makes all peace-loving people see that world peace has a reliable guarantee.

The working people of capitalist countries, colonial countries, and dependent countries in Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Africa, regardless of the frantic suppression by imperialism and domestic reactionaries, enthusiastically held parades and demonstrations on this day.

Three million working people across Japan, overcoming the bloody suppression by the US-Japan reactionaries, bravely held rallies and demonstrations. This unprecedentedly large-scale demonstration strongly expressed the firm will of the Japanese working people to oppose the separate treaty, oppose rearmament, and strive for independence and freedom. The working people of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Thailand also held parades, rallies, and demonstrations. Demonstrators in Lebanon firmly expressed their opposition to the aggressive "Middle East Command" and their support for the struggles of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Korea against imperialism. The working people of Western European capitalist countries—France, Britain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland—under the slogans of defending peace, defending national independence and the right to live, and opposing war and the policy of arms expansion and war preparation, widely held May Day demonstrations and rallies. The working people of West Germany, despite the obstruction and persecution of the occupation authorities and the Adenauer reactionary government, still demonstrated their firm will to strive for unification and the rapid conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty and to oppose rearmament and the "General Treaty" that splits Germany, with huge rallies and parades. Demonstrators in Austria firmly opposed the re-militarization of western Austria. In the United States, several thousand working people in New York held a May Day demonstration against US militarization and fascism, demanding the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and an end to the war of aggression against Korea. The working people of many countries in Latin America who held demonstrations unanimously opposed the enslavement of Latin American countries by US imperialism. In North Africa, in Algeria and Tunisia, the working people, regardless of the tear gas of French colonialists and police and the intimidation of aircraft, bravely shouted the slogans "Strive for democratic independence, oppose colonial oppression" and held demonstrations.

The large-scale demonstrations held by the working people of capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries to celebrate May Day fully demonstrate their urgent desire for peace and their determination to fight heroically against war. Undoubtedly, this struggle is a serious blow to the imperialist arms expansion, war preparation plans, and aggressive wars.

The Japanese People Launch a Struggle Against American Enslavement and for Independence and Freedom

Ignoring the strong opposition of the Japanese people and the people of all of Asia, the US government and the Yoshida government announced on April 28 that the American-made separate treaty had officially "come into effect"; the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan were illegally dissolved by the US government. This illegal move shows that US imperialism, regardless of the wishes of the Japanese people, will continue to occupy Japan, rearm Japan, and enslave the Japanese people in accordance with the illegal "treaty," further making Japan a "legitimate" colony and military base of the United States in order to expand its aggression against Asia.

Simultaneous with the US announcement of the "entry into force" of the separate treaty, US imperialism is further directing the Yoshida reactionary government to step up rearmament. According to an AFP Tokyo dispatch of April 21, US occupation headquarters chief of staff Hickey wrote to Yoshida government state minister Okazaki Katsuo on April 7, openly demanding that the Yoshida government revise the constitutional provisions on renouncing war and rejecting armed forces after the separate treaty "comes into effect." In addition to promising to revise the constitution, the Yoshida government has announced the formal establishment of the so-called "Maritime Safety Force" on April 28, the "date the treaty comes into effect." Japan's disguised army, the "Police Reserve Force," has been renamed the "Security Force."

In order to clear the way for rearmament, the Yoshida government, following the will of the United States, is stepping up the implementation of fascist rule over the Japanese people. Before the separate treaty "came into effect," the Yoshida government was manufacturing a series of fascist bills centered on the "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill" to attack the freedom and democratic rights of the Japanese people, and it was massively removing the "purge" of Japanese fascists, actively restoring Japanese militarism. Simultaneously with the "entry into force" of the separate treaty, the US government also abandoned the decision of the 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference attended by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and China, and illegally dissolved the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan. This illegal measure by the US government is obviously intended to be able to enslave the democratic rights of the Japanese people and revive Japanese militarism as it pleases in the future.

The US government's announcement that the separate treaty had "come into effect" has aroused widespread anger and resolute protest from the Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party parliamentary group issued a statement on the "date the treaty came into effect" (April 28) saying: We reaffirm our determination to demand the abolition of the traitorous "treaty" and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Japan, and to liberate the Japanese people. On the same day, students from many universities across Japan went on strike to protest the "entry into force" of the "treaty" and the anti-democratic "Anti-Subversive Activities Bill," which strongly demonstrated the will of the Japanese people to fight to smash the traitorous "treaty" and to strive for independence and democracy.

Our country and the Soviet Union and other major countries that fought against Japan were completely excluded from the preparation and drafting of this "treaty" by the United States, and refused to sign and ratify this "treaty." Therefore, the American-made separate treaty has no binding force on these countries. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai stated on September 18 last year: Our Central People's Government believes that the American-made treaty with Japan is illegal, invalid, and absolutely cannot be recognized. On the 6th of this month, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai again issued a solemn statement: The Chinese people "insist that all occupying troops must withdraw from Japan; the illegal separate treaty with Japan announced by the United States is absolutely unacceptable; and the Yoshida-Chiang Kai-shek 'treaty,' which openly insults and antagonizes the Chinese people, is resolutely opposed." The Chinese people, together with the Japanese people and the people of all of Asia, must resolutely oppose the illegal American-made separate treaty. The Japanese people are heroically launching a struggle against American enslavement and for freedom and independence.

Because the US-Japan reactionaries fear the strength of the Japanese people, they have adopted a barbaric and brutal policy of suppression. The large-scale May Day demonstrations of the Japanese working people suffered bloody suppression by the US-Japan reactionaries. According to incomplete statistics, in the May Day massacre, in Tokyo alone, 500 to 600 innocent people were killed or injured, and more than 200 people were injured by the police in Kyoto. However, this bloody atrocity by the American occupiers and their running dog, the Japanese Yoshida puppet government, can only further arouse the great anger and opposition of the Japanese people and peace-loving people around the world.

The scale of the Japanese working people's May Day demonstration this year was unprecedented in Japanese history, and in the demonstration, three million working people across Japan unanimously shouted the slogan "Oppose rearmament, strive for national independence." This fully shows that the strength of the Japanese people has rapidly grown and become stronger, and this strength has caused the US policy of occupying Japan and the policy of the US-Japan reactionaries to rearm Japan to suffer increasingly heavy blows. According to a United Press report from Washington on the 2nd of this month: People close to the US State Department have had to openly admit: "It can be seen from the May Day demonstrations... that the Japanese people have shown their hatred for the West." The British Conservative Party newspaper "Daily Telegraph" also expressed concern about the setbacks suffered by its American masters' aggressive policy in Japan in an editorial published on the 2nd of this month. It said: The Japanese people's May Day demonstration has "shattered the belief of the whole world (referring to the imperialist aggressive bloc) that Japan is turning to democracy (referring to joining the aggressive bloc)."

Only three days after announcing the entry into force of the US-Japan separate "treaty," the American occupiers dispatched thousands of armed occupation troops and directed tens of thousands of Japanese police and secret agents to launch a barbaric attack on the Japanese people who were parading and demonstrating, opening fire and slaughtering innocent Japanese people. This unscrupulous and ferocious behavior of the American occupiers clearly demonstrated the tyrannical posture of the colonial masters in front of the Japanese people. This bloody fact completely shattered the lie that the US-Japan separate "treaty" brought "independence" to Japan. As for the Yoshida reactionary government, it fully exposed itself as a shameful tool of the American occupiers to suppress the Japanese people in this bloody tragedy. It served the US occupation policy with its frantic act of mass slaughter of the Japanese people. After the "May Day" massacre, the Yoshida reactionary government attempted to continue to serve its American masters by "further strengthening suppression" and "conducting searches and arrests" throughout Japan. This cruel and shameless behavior of the US-Japan reactionaries has thoroughly exposed them as irreconcilable enemies of Japan's independence and freedom in front of the Japanese people.

The cruel crimes of the US-Japan reactionaries will never intimidate the heroic Japanese people. The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata" has issued a call to Japanese workers to hold a general strike and overthrow the Yoshida government. The left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party also unanimously believe that the Yoshida government should be held responsible for the tragedy; Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the left wing of the Socialist Party, also condemned the Yoshida government for moving towards fascism and demanded the resignation of the Yoshida cabinet. Obviously, the Japanese people have become more aware of the path they should take; their heroic struggle for independence and freedom will therefore become even more high-spirited.

Peace-loving people all over the world pay infinite respect and unanimous support to the heroic struggle of the Japanese people. Under the strong leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, as long as the Japanese people continue to strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, they will surely be able to finally defeat the US-Japan reactionaries and achieve Japan's true independence and freedom.

    国际述评
    全世界劳动人民保卫和平的强大示威
    在“五一”国际劳动节这一天，世界各国的劳动人民举行了示威游行和集会，庆祝自己的节日，检阅自己的力量。各国劳动人民庆祝“五一”节的强大示威，是各国劳动人民保卫和平、反对战争的坚决意志的最生动的表现，它显示了劳动人民的兄弟般的友爱团结更加扩大和加强。
    从北京到柏林，和平民主阵营各国的劳动人民，在保卫和平与经济建设获得新的伟大胜利的情况下，欢欣鼓舞地庆祝自己的节日。在抗美援朝和生产建设两条战线上获得巨大成就的我国劳动人民，正在进行着伟大的共产主义建设的苏联劳动人民，正进行社会主义建设的许多人民民主国家的人民，正在英勇地为争取祖国解放而战斗的朝鲜劳动人民，都举行了盛大的示威游行和集会。各国劳动人民在示威游行中显示了工人阶级的团结和保卫和平的坚定意志与不可战胜的力量，并显示了他们加强国家经济建设、生活水平日益提高的欢愉的心情。这些国家的劳动人民力量的强大，鼓舞着全世界劳动人民的斗争意志，使一切爱好和平的人民都看到了世界和平有着可靠的保障。
    亚洲、欧洲、美洲和非洲的资本主义国家、殖民地国家和附属国的劳动人民，不顾帝国主义和国内反动派的疯狂镇压，在这一天热烈地举行了游行示威。
    日本全国各地三百万劳动人民，战胜美日反动派的血腥镇压，英勇地举行了集会示威。这次规模空前的强大示威，强烈地表现了日本劳动人民反对单独和约、反对重新武装与争取独立自由的坚强意志。印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰和泰国的劳动人民也都举行了游行、集会和示威。黎巴嫩的示威群众坚决表示反对侵略性的“中东司令部”，支持突尼斯、摩洛哥和朝鲜人民反对帝国主义的斗争。西欧资本主义国家——法国、英国、意大利、比利时、荷兰和瑞士等国的劳动人民，在保卫和平、保卫民族独立和生活权利、反对战争和扩军备战政策的口号下，广泛地举行了庆祝五一节的示威游行和集会。西德的劳动人民不顾占领当局和阿登纳反动政府的阻挠和迫害，依然以巨大的集会游行，表现了他们争取统一及迅速缔结全面和约、反对重新武装和分裂德国的“一般条约”的坚决意志。奥地利的示威群众坚决反对奥地利西部的重新军国主义化。在美国，纽约几千劳动人民举行了“五一”节示威游行，反对美国军国主义化和法西斯化，要求缔结五大国和平公约和停止侵略朝鲜的战争。拉丁美洲许多国家举行示威游行的劳动人民，一致反对美帝国主义对拉丁美洲国家的奴役。在北非，阿尔及利亚和突尼斯，劳动人民不顾法国殖民者和警察的催泪弹和飞机的恐吓，英勇地高呼“争取民主独立，反对殖民压迫”的口号，举行了示威游行。
    资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国劳动人民为庆祝
    “五一”节而举行的声势浩大的示威，充分表现了他们要求和平、反对战争的迫切愿望和英勇斗争的决心。无疑的，这一斗争对帝国主义的扩军备战计划和侵略战争是一个严重的打击。
    日本人民展开反对美国奴役、争取独立自由的斗争
    美国政府和吉田政府不顾日本人民和全亚洲人民的强烈反对，竟于四月二十八日宣布美制单独和约开始正式“生效”；远东委员会和盟国对日委员会都被美国政府非法宣告解散。这一非法举措，表明美帝国主义不顾日本人民的意愿，将根据非法的
    “和约”，继续占领日本、重新武装日本与奴役日本人民，进一步使日本成为美国“合法的”殖民地和军事基地，以扩大它对亚洲的侵略行动。
    与美国宣布单独和约的“生效”同时，美帝国主义正进一步指使吉田反动政府加紧进行重新武装。据法新社东京四月二十一日电透露，美国占领军总部参谋长希凯曾在四月七日写信给吉田政府国务相冈崎胜男，公然要求吉田政府在单独和约“生效”后修改关于弃绝战争和摈斥武装部队的宪法条文。吉田政府除已允诺修改宪法外，已宣布在四月二十八日，即“和约生效日”正式成立所谓“海上警备队”。日本的变相陆军——“警察后备队”已改名为“保安队”。
    为了替重新武装扫清道路，吉田政府奉行美国意旨，正加紧对日本人民实行法西斯统治。在单独和约“生效”前，吉田政府就在制造以“防止破坏活动法案”为中心的一系列的法西斯法案，向日本人民的自由和民主权利进攻；并大批解除日本法西斯分子的“整肃”，积极恢复日本的军国主义。与单独和约“生效”的同时，美国政府又背弃了有苏联、美、英和中国参加的一九四五年莫斯科外长会议的决定，非法地解散了远东委员会和盟国对日委员会。美国政府的这一非法措施，显然是为了今后能为所欲为地奴役日本人民的民主权利和复活日本军国主义。
    美国政府宣布单独和约“生效”，已激起日本人民的普遍愤怒和坚决抗议。日本共产党国会议员团在“和约生效日”（四月二十八日）发表声明说：我们重申我们的决心，要求废除卖国的“和约”和美日“安全条约”，要求外国军队撤离日本，解放日本人民。同一天，日本全国许多大学的学生纷纷罢课抗议“和约”的“生效”和反民主的“防止破坏活动法案”，这强烈地表现了日本人民为粉碎卖国“和约”，为争取独立民主而斗争的意志。
    我国和苏联等对日作战的主要国家，在美国的排斥下，完全没有参加这一“和约”的准备和拟制，并且拒绝签署和批准这个“和约”，因此，美制单独和约对这些国家毫无约束力。我国周恩来外交部长已于去年九月十八日声明：我中央人民政府认为美制对日和约是非法的，无效的，而且是绝对不能承认的。本月六日，我国周恩来外长再次发表严正声明：中国人民“坚持一切占领军队必须撤离日本；对于美国所宣布生效的非法的单独对日和约，是绝对不能承认的；对于公开侮辱并敌视中国人民的吉田蒋介石‘和约’，是坚决反对的。”中国人民与日本人民以及全亚洲人民在一起，一定要坚决反对非法的美制单独和约。日本人民正英勇地展开了反对美国奴役、争取自由独立的斗争。
    美日反动派因为害怕日本人民的力量，就采取了野蛮残暴的镇压政策。日本劳动人民声势浩大的五一劳动节示威游行，遭受了美日反动派的血腥镇压。据不完全的统计，在“五一”惨案中，仅在东京一地就有无辜群众五六百人伤亡，在京都被警察打伤的亦达二百多人。但是，美国占领者及其走狗日本吉田傀儡政府的这一血腥暴行，只能更加激起日本人民和全世界爱好和平人民的极大的愤怒和反对。
    日本劳动人民这次五一节的示威游行的规模在日本历史上是空前的，并且在示威中日本全国各地三百万劳动人民一致喊出了“反对重整军备、争取民族独立”的口号。这充分显示出日本人民的力量已迅速地增长壮大起来了，这个力量已使美国对日占领政策和美日反动派重新武装日本的政策，遭受了越来越沉重的打击。据美国合众社本月二日华盛顿二日电报道：接近美国国务院的人士已不得不公开承认：“由五一示威游行可以看出……日本人民显示了他们对西方的憎恨”。英国保守党的报纸“每日电讯报”在本月二日所发表的社论中，也对它的美国主子的侵略政策在日本所遭受到的挫折而忧心忡忡。它说：日本人民五一节的示威已“粉碎了全世界（指帝国主义侵略集团）对日本转向民主（指参加侵略集团）一事所抱的信念”。
    美国占领者在他们宣布了美日单独“和约”生效之后仅仅三天，即出动了上千的武装占领军，并指挥成万的日本警察和特务，向游行示威的日本人民发动野蛮进攻，开枪屠杀无辜的日本人民。美国占领者的这种肆无忌惮的凶恶做法，显然是在日本人民面前完全摆出了殖民地主人的横暴姿态。这个血腥的事实，彻底地粉碎了美日单独“和约”给日本带来了“独立”的谎言。至于吉田反动政府，则在这个流血惨案中充分暴露了它是美国占领者镇压日本人民的可耻工具。它以大规模屠杀日本人民的疯狂行为，来替美国的占领政策服务。而在“五一”惨案之后，吉田反动政府更妄图以“进一步加强镇压”和在日本全国各地“进行搜查和逮捕”，为它的美国主子继续效劳。美日反动派的这种残暴无耻行径，已在日本人民面前彻底暴露了他们是日本独立自由的不共戴天的仇敌。
    美日反动派的残暴罪行，绝不能吓倒英雄的日本人民。日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”已向日本工人发出举行总罢工、打倒吉田政府的号召。日本社会党左派和右派也一致认为吉田政府应对惨案负责；社会党左派主席铃木茂三郎并谴责吉田政府趋向法西斯化，要求吉田内阁辞职。显然的，日本人民已经更加看清了自己应走的道路；他们争取独立自由的英勇斗争将因此而更加高涨起来。
    全世界爱好和平的人民对日本人民的英勇斗争都寄以无限的敬意和一致支持。日本人民在日本共产党的坚强领导下，只要继续加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够最后战胜美日反动派而求得日本的真正独立和自由。
