The "June 1st" International Children's Day is a holiday for children all over the world, and it is also a day for peace-loving people all over the world to fight for the rights of children to survival, health, and democratic education. This year, domestically, the great victories of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and the ongoing extensive movement to increase production and practice economy have paved the way for China's peaceful construction. Internationally, the strength of the peace camp has grown unprecedentedly, and the just and heroic actions of the Chinese and Korean people have inspired peace-loving people all over the world, making the small group of war mongers headed by U.S. imperialism more isolated in the face of the people of the world. Not long ago, the successful achievements of the International Economic Conference and the International Conference for the Defence of Children powerfully demonstrated the universal belief of the people of the world in the need for peace and the powerful force for defending peace. Therefore:

I. This year's commemoration of "June 1st" International Children's Day should publicize these great victories and achievements of the working people at home and abroad to children throughout the country, so that they can universally receive a vivid and concrete patriotic and internationalist education. Let them see the great and beautiful prospects of the motherland and their broad and happy future, encourage them to prepare to participate in the great cause of building the motherland, and love Chairman Mao and the Communist Party even more. At the same time, children should be made aware of the dark and miserable lives of children in colonial, semi-colonial, and capitalist countries, so that they can recognize and hate the crimes of the war mongers who are destroying the happy lives and bright future of children all over the world. Educate them to care about the fate of children all over the world, to love the Soviet Union, the fortress of world peace and democracy, and to love all peace-loving countries and peoples, in order to cultivate children's internationalist spirit.

II. Through the celebration of "June 1st", the achievements and resolutions of the International Conference for the Defence of Children should also be publicized to the people of the whole country. Call on the people of the whole country to rise up against the war schemes of the war mongers, against germ warfare and all criminal acts of harming children, so as to strengthen the will of the people of the whole country to defend the motherland and defend peace. At the same time, all people who are concerned with and engaged in children's education, children's health care, childcare work, and children's welfare should be called upon to regard children as the future hope of the country and the successors to the cause of building the motherland, to care for and love children, to strictly oppose and stop all acts that harm children's physical and mental health, and to jointly do a good job in cultivating and educating the new generation.

III. All localities should carry out various educational and meaningful celebration activities according to the above-mentioned central content of education and the physical and mental characteristics of children, so that children can have a happy and meaningful holiday. Based on the experience of celebrating "June 1st" last year, the following specific suggestions are put forward:

(1) This year's celebration of "June 1st" will still be held in a decentralized manner by schools (or a combination of several schools), kindergartens, nurseries, and childcare centers, uniting children outside the schools. At the city level, a brief children's representative meeting suitable for children's characteristics can be organized, inviting leading officials, heroes, model workers, scientists, writers, and other representative figures to meet with the children.

(2) Children can be made aware of the country's economic and cultural construction by means of visits, tours, bonfire rallies, and meetings with heroes, model workers, scientists, writers and other famous people. They can learn the working class’s excellent quality of loving public property and selflessly working for the country. They can review their achievements and shortcomings in practicing the "three wants and three don'ts" (want to love public property, want to cherish time, want to live a simple life; don't be selfish, don't waste, don't be greedy for small advantages, don't steal other people's things). Or they can hold small exhibitions to show the achievements of children's scientific and artistic creations and social work, so that children can see their achievements and strength, and encourage them to study and work hard in preparation for the great cause of building the motherland. In addition, it is also possible to organize school children and children from local relief agencies to have a get-together, so that they can all feel the happy life and bright future of children growing up in the new China.

(3) The preparatory committees organized by various localities to commemorate "June 1st" should mobilize and organize literary and scientific departments to hold various activities for children according to the possible conditions, such as broadcasting, showing slideshows and movies, performing dramas, and holding picture propaganda exhibitions, to carry out publicity and education on the above-mentioned contents for children.

(4) Local health departments should do a good job in children's immunization, health check-ups, and other work, and publicize epidemic prevention, maternal and child hygiene, and childcare knowledge to children's parents.

(5) In accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of the International Conference for the Defence of Children, schools, factories, mines, women's organizations, health, and education departments should convene children's educators, children's health care workers, and children's parents to discuss the achievements and resolutions of the International Conference for the Defence of Children, and in connection with the actual situation of children's education and children's health care in our country, oppose all residual educational thoughts and behaviors that are harmful to children, in order to improve children's education and children's health care in our country. At the city level, symposiums of representatives from all walks of life can be held to expand the influence of the International Conference for the Defence of Children.

IV. Last year, some areas still had phenomena in organizing and leading children to carry out "June 1st" activities, such as heavy activities, excessive time, and rush activities (such as organizing parades, inspections, sports meets, etc.), which affected children's health; or there were incorrect practices of selecting models and setting up banners among children; or there were health competitions, which made a small number of children from more affluent families obtain health certificates, which were not educationally meaningful. This year, it is necessary to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings, and children should be able to spend their holidays in a relaxed and happy manner, and be able to gain education from them.

V. Before the end of July, the provincial and municipal levels should send a summary of the "June 1st" activities in their regions to the National Preparatory Committee (National Committee of the Chinese People's Defence of Children in Beijing), and attach photo materials if possible.

    “六一”国际儿童节全国筹备委员会
    庆祝“六一”国际儿童节的通知
    “六一”国际儿童节是全世界儿童自己的节日，也是全世界爱好和平的人民，为争取儿童生存、健康、民主教育的权利而斗争的日子。今年，在国内，由于抗美援朝、“三反”、“五反”运动的伟大胜利及目前正在广泛开展着的增产节约运动，为我国的和平建设事业铺平了道路。国际方面，和平阵营的力量空前壮大，中朝人民用自己正义英勇的行为，鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人们，使以美帝国主义为首的一小撮战争贩子在全世界人民面前更形孤立。不久以前，国际经济会议与国际保卫儿童大会的胜利成就，有力地显示了全世界人民要求和平的普遍信念与保卫和平的强大力量。因此：
    一、今年纪念“六一”国际儿童节，应向全国儿童宣传国内国际劳动人民的这些伟大的胜利与成就，使他们普遍受到一次生动具体的爱国主义、国际主义教育。让他们看到祖国伟大美好的远景与自己广阔幸福的前途，鼓舞他们准备参加建设祖国的伟大事业，更加热爱毛主席和共产党。同时应使儿童知道殖民地、半殖民地、资本主义国家儿童黑暗悲惨的生活，使他们认识与仇恨战争贩子摧残全世界儿童幸福生活与美好前途的罪行。教育他们关心全世界儿童的命运，热爱世界和平民主的堡垒苏联和斯大林大元帅，热爱一切爱好和平的国家与人民，以培养儿童的国际主义精神。
    二、通过庆祝“六一”，还应向全国人民宣传国际保卫儿童大会的成就与决议。号召全国人民起来反对战争贩子的战争阴谋、反对细菌战与残害儿童的一切罪恶行为，从而加强全国人民保卫祖国、保卫和平的意志。同时应号召全国一切关心与从事儿童教育工作、儿童保健、保育工作、儿童福利事业的人们和父母们，要把儿童看作是国家未来的希望与祖国建设事业的继承者，要关心爱护儿童，严格地反对和制止一切残害儿童身心的行为，共同做好培养教育新一代的工作。
    三、各地应根据上述教育的中心内容和儿童的身心特点，进行各种有教育意义的庆祝活动，使儿童过一个愉快的有意义的节日。兹根据去年庆祝“六一”的经验，提出下列具体意见：
    （一）今年庆祝“六一”，仍以学校（或数校联合）、幼儿园、保育院、托儿所等为单位，团结校外儿童，分散举行。市一级可以组织简短而适合儿童特点的儿童代表会，邀请首长、英雄模范、科学家、文学家等各种代表性的人物与儿童见面。
    （二）可以通过访问、参观、举办营火会、组织英雄模范、科学家、文学家等各种著名人士与儿童见面，使儿童们了解祖国经济文化建设的情况，学习工人阶级爱护公共财物与为祖国事业忘我劳动的优秀品质，检查自己实行“三要三不要”（要爱护公共财物、要爱惜时间、要生活朴素；不要损公利己、不要浪费、不要贪小便宜、偷窃别人东西。）的成绩与缺点；或集中儿童平日的科学、艺术创作及社会工作的成绩，举办小型展览会，使儿童们看到自己的成绩与力量，鼓舞他们为准备建设祖国的伟大事业而努力学习、工作的信心。此外也可以组织学校儿童和当地救济机关的儿童联欢，使他们同样感到生长在新中国的儿童的幸福生活和美好前途。
    （三）各地为纪念“六一”组织的筹备委员会应根据可能条件，动员组织文艺科学部门，为儿童举办各种活动，如广播、放映幻灯电影、表演戏剧、举办图片宣传画展览等，对儿童进行关于上述内容的宣传教育。
    （四）各地卫生部门应做好儿童预防接种、健康检查等工作，并对儿童父母宣传防疫、妇幼卫生、育儿知识等。
    （五）各地应根据国际保卫儿童大会决议的精神，以学校、厂矿、妇女组织、卫生、保教部门为主召集儿童教育工作者、儿童保健保育工作者、儿童父母，座谈国际保卫儿童大会的成就与决议，并联系我国儿童教育、儿童保健保育工作的实际情况，反对各种残余的有害儿童的教育思想与行为，以改进我国的儿童教育、儿童保健保育工作。市一级可以召开各界代表人物的座谈会，以扩大国际保卫儿童大会的影响。
    四、去年有些地区在组织与领导儿童进行“六一”活动时，仍有活动繁重、时间过长、搞突击性大活动（如组织游行检阅、运动大会等），以致影响儿童健康的现象；或有在儿童中进行评选模范，树立旗帜的错误做法；或有举行健康比赛，使少数家庭生活比较优裕的儿童获得健康奖状的缺乏教育意义的活动。今年务须纠正上述缺点，应使儿童轻松、愉快地度过自己的节日，并能从中获得教育。
    五、七月底前，省市一级应将本地区“六一”活动的总结，寄来全国筹委会（北京中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会），并在可能条件下附照片资料。
