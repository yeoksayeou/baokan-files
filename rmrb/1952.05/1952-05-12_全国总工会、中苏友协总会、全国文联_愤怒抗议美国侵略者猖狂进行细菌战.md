The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles have each issued statements, unanimously protesting the heinous crime of germ warfare committed by the United States, as confessed by captured American airmen.

The statement from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The heinous crime of germ warfare committed by the American aggressors is already an undeniable fact with ironclad evidence. Recently, two American airmen POWs who personally participated in this crime confessed to the fact that the American government systematically and on a large scale used bacteriological weapons in Korea. This once again completely exposed the conspiracy of the United States to launch germ warfare. The people of China and the peace-loving people of the world absolutely cannot tolerate this insane crime of the American government. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representing the Chinese working class, warns the American government: Your inhuman crime of using bacteriological weapons has aroused the public outrage of the people of the world; if you do not immediately stop this crime, you will surely be subject to the trial of human justice.

The statement from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association said: The American aggressors' brazen violation of international law to conduct germ warfare will only further incite the righteous indignation of the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of the world. The workers of the Soviet Union in urban and rural areas have held rallies, expressing their extreme resentment and hatred towards the American germ warfare criminals. The Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, has repeatedly and sternly condemned the crime of American germ warfare in the United Nations Disarmament Commission, demanding that the commission immediately sanction the United States. We, the Chinese people, are very grateful for this great action that supports justice. All members of our Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should further strengthen and consolidate the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet people. We believe that in front of the strong fortress of peace formed by China and the Soviet Union, any conspiracy of the American aggressors will be completely shattered.

The statement from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: The confessions, broadcasts, and open letters of captured American airmen Lieutenant Enoch and Quinn powerfully exposed the heinous crime of the American aggressors in systematically carrying out an inhuman bacteriological warfare of extermination. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, on behalf of all literary and art workers in the country, hereby solemnly condemns this atrocity of the American aggressors. We assert: With the efforts of all people in the world who uphold justice and fight for peace, the rampant germ warfare being carried out by the American aggressors will surely be defeated and will inevitably be subject to the just trial of the people of the world.

    愤怒抗议美国侵略者猖狂进行细菌战
    【本报讯】中华全国总工会、中苏友好协会总会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会分别发表声明，一致抗议美国空军俘虏供认的美国进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    中华全国总工会的声明说：美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，早已是铁证如山不容抵赖的了。最近，两个亲身参加这个罪行的美国空军战俘供认了美国政府在朝鲜有计划地大规模使用细菌武器的事实。再一次把美国发动细菌战的阴谋彻底揭穿。中国和全世界爱好和平的人民，对美国政府这种疯狂绝顶的罪行，是绝对不能容忍的。中华全国总工会代表中国工人阶级警告美国政府：你们灭绝人性地使用细菌武器的罪行，已经激起了全世界人民的公愤；如果不立即停止这种罪行，就一定会遭到人类正义的裁判。
    中苏友好协会总会的声明说：美国侵略者悍然破坏国际公法进行细菌战，将只会更加激发中国人民，朝鲜人民和全世界人民的义愤。苏联全国城乡劳动者，纷纷举行集会，表示了对美国细菌战犯的极端愤恨与憎恶。苏联驻联合国代表马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会上曾数次严厉地指责美国细菌战的罪行，要求该委员会立即对美国加以制裁。这种支持正义的伟大行动，是我们中国人民非常感谢的。我们中苏友好协会全体会员更应当进一步加强和巩固中苏两国人民的伟大团结。我们相信，在中苏两国结成的坚强的和平堡垒前面，美国侵略者的任何阴谋一定会被彻底粉碎。
    中华全国文学艺术界联合会的声明中说：被俘的美国空军中尉伊纳克和奎恩两人的供词、广播词和公开信，有力地暴露了美国侵略者有计划地进行灭绝人性的细菌战争的滔天罪行。中华全国文学艺术界联合会代表全国一切文艺工作者对美国侵略者这种暴行特申严正的声讨。我们断言：在全世界所有主张正义与为和平而斗争的人们的努力之下，美国侵略者猖狂进行的细菌战争，是一定会被打垮，并且必将受到世界人民的正义的裁判。
