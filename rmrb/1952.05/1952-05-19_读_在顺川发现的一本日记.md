    Reading "A Diary Found in Sunchon"
    Jiang Huan
    Roman Kim's "A Diary Found in Sunchon" [1] is an educational novel. This novel depicts the defeat of the American bandits in Korea, and focuses primarily on fully exposing the long-planned conspiracy of the American and Japanese reactionaries to prepare for anti-Soviet and anti-communist war, including the heinous plan to use bacteriological weapons against peaceful people. With rich historical knowledge and profound insight, the author reveals the process of the development and change of the international situation from the Second World War to the Korean War. The shocking and bloody facts in this novel tell us that we must wage a resolute struggle against these common enemies of mankind, to crush their conspiracies, cut off their bloody hands, and defend the lasting peace of mankind.
    The novel adopts the style of a diary. The author introduces it as the diary of a Japanese special agent captured when the Chinese and Korean people liberated Sunchon. The diarist—a lifelong executioner engaged in espionage in China and Korea, codenamed "Hiropon" [2]—observed and recorded the changes in the fate of the "Japanese Empire" and himself from the reactionary standpoint of a Japanese militarist, under the policy of the United States supporting Japan to oppose the Soviet Union and attack the mainland. The relationship between "Hiropon" and the American agent Hashiberger, recorded in the diary, demonstrates the development process of collusion between American and Japanese reactionary forces from "dog eat dog" to birds of a feather.
    In these records, the author organized rich historical materials, sketched the images of many characters, and revealed the changes in the international situation before and after the Second World War.
    The facts listed in the novel expose the sinister conspiracy of American imperialism to launch an anti-Soviet war. After Truman came to power in 1945, he prepared to quickly make peace with Japan in order to plan an anti-Soviet war. Miao Bin, the secret envoy sent to Tokyo by Chiang Kai-shek, was the middleman who expressed the Kuomintang's anti-communist determination and connected the United States and Japan. On the other hand, the Japanese reactionaries also attempted to end the war quickly in order to "preserve their strength" and join the United States in attacking the Soviet Union in the near future, and to suppress the domestic workers' movement. Thus, when the Soviet Union victoriously attacked the fascist nest on the Western Front, the reactionary rulers of the United States and Japan increasingly felt that their fighting each other was a "stupid" and "tragic mistake," and were planning to resolve their conflicting interests through aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, before the flames of the Second World War were extinguished, imperialism was already secretly calculating to launch a war against the Soviet Union. It was not until later that the protagonist of the novel, "Hiropon," wrote that he gradually understood the reason why American planes only bombed the slums of Tokyo without touching the prosperous commercial areas, and the significance of the United States using atomic bombs two days before the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. Herein lies the true intention of American imperialism.
    When the Soviet Union sent troops to the Far East, the Japanese warlords, in their dying frenzy, actually believed that "the dreams of the Empire's warriors for the past twenty years have finally begun to be realized, the war against the Soviet Union has begun!" For a long time, they had been experimenting with a "secret weapon"—in the bacterial laboratories in Niigata and Hokkaido, Japan, as well as in the "Unit 731" at Pingfang Station near Harbin and the "Unit 100" at Mengjiatun near "Xinjing" (Changchun), they had been able to "successfully" manufacture bacterial bombs invented by Shiro Ishii. The Japanese invaders placed their hopes on such weapons. They used crazy dreams to "comfort" their demise, and they spread rumors: "Bacterial bombs have been dropped on seventeen Siberian cities!" They cheered: "Long live His Majesty the Emperor!"... However, the facts finally shattered all crazy fantasies. The laboratories in Pingfang and Mengjiatun were destroyed before they could produce fresh and usable bacterial bombs, and the powerful Soviet troops crushed the Kwantung Army with overwhelming force. Japan surrendered unconditionally! The conspiracy of American imperialism had long been revealed; the American military command nominated two candidates to go to Japan to negotiate the surrender—Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army Kawabe and former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Tsukahara, both of whom had served as "military attachés" in Moscow and were "famous Soviet intelligence experts."
    The United States' violation of the Potsdam Proclamation and agreement, and its arbitrary implementation of a policy of preserving the forces of Japanese militarism, was meticulously and thoughtfully planned. During "Hiropon's" period of "concealment" in the countryside, he discovered that the so-called "patients" who had "lost their memory" and held false certificates were not just him, and the American military police gave them extra protection. When he returned to Tokyo, "Hiropon" often encountered acquaintances from the army on the street—once he met Fan Ye, who had killed countless people in the Tianjin area, selling newspapers, and another time he met Matsuya, who was famous for torturing prisoners in Guam, riding a tricycle carrying an American old lady. From Ii, "Hiropon" learned that the former Air Force Officers' Association had been transformed into an "agricultural cooperative" without any changes, the "Yeast Fertilizer Company" was the incarnation of Ishihara's "East Asia League," the "Tricycle Cooperative" was an organization of former army and navy officers... and so on. Radio broadcasts, in the form of missing person advertisements, conveyed the time and place of secret gatherings of various military groups. In order to avoid attention (especially inconvenient was the presence of a Soviet representative in the Allied Supreme Command), Japan had a special "underground organization"—an "underground organization" approved and supported by the highest authorities. However, all these measures could not deceive the people, and progressive news agencies abroad soon revealed their "secrets."
    However, the situation in the East outside of Japan was undergoing fundamental and world-shaking changes. On the Chinese mainland, not only did the "military assistance" that Japan gave to the Kuomintang reactionaries according to the secret agreement between Sumida, Okamura Neiji, Yan Xishan, and He Yingqin not have any practical effect, but even America's own "support" did not save Chiang Kai-shek from defeat. But American imperialism was unwilling to fail, and it blatantly recruited soldiers and horses, attempting to make a final struggle. The United States ordered Japan to supply the army, pilots, tank soldiers, artillery... according to Chiang Kai-shek's requirements. But the Japanese reactionary authorities were more willing to accept the "suggestion" of sending troops to Taiwan than sending troops to the mainland, because they also felt that the former was like "pouring water from a teapot onto a volcano," which was of no help, while the latter might "recover" Taiwan and re-enter the "Empire's" territory. At the same time, American imperialism expanded its "spy network" and deployed an invasion war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In this novel, it is recorded in detail how the American culprits and their lackeys in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan completed various conspiracies and deployments within five years after the war and launched a new war.
    What deserves special mention is the exposure in this novel of the American imperialists' preparation and plan to conduct bacteriological warfare. Before the attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the "detailed" bacteriological warfare plan of war criminals Shiro Ishii and Jiro Wakamatsu was submitted to the American General Staff and a "final plan" was reached. Once, when "Hiropon" had an "audience" with MacArthur, he saw Shiro Ishii with his own eyes, who was said to have been shielded and rescued by MacArthur during the Khabarovsk war crimes trial. General Kotani, who was with him when he met MacArthur, whispered in his ear: "Ishii will soon go to the United States to work at the Woolpert Laboratory at Fort Detrick near Washington!" Later (after the American landing at Incheon), in a concentration camp in Pyongyang, "Hiropon" discovered a group of American biologists and toxicologists experimenting with several new vaccines on prisoners, including Ishii Shiro's "1-8" and "1-11" liquids. They found that women injected with "1-11" liquid died thirty-two seconds later than men, and that those injected with "1-8" liquid died seventeen seconds earlier. This diary nakedly writes out the heinous conspiracy of American and Japanese war criminals, who dared to defy the world, to prepare to use bacteriological weapons, which are not tolerated by international law and upright humanity.
    In addition to fully exposing the crimes of the American, Japanese, Chiang, and Korean conspiracies against the Soviet Union and communism, the novel also reveals the heroic struggles of the Japanese and Korean people, as well as the contradictions between the reactionaries through the records of the special agent "Hiropon."
    Although "Hiropon" and Hashiberger were engaged in evil deeds together, the two maintained hostility towards each other, and more than once showed their fangs to each other like two vicious dogs, insulting and even fighting each other. As for the treatment of the puppets and servants of "Great Korea," the new and old invaders of the United States and Japan were even more contemptuous. In the chaos of the retreat from Suwon, "Hiropon" grabbed the car of Syngman Rhee's "senior official" and casually shot a "Great Korean" official, which was enough to illustrate the relationship of this "alliance."
    Through the tone of the special agent "Hiropon," the author reveals the true situation of the Japanese and Korean people's struggle against imperialism and domestic reactionaries. For example, when mentioning the reaction of the domestic working people to the incident when Japan had just surrendered, the special agent "Hiropon" wrote angrily and frustratedly:
    The internal enemies warmly welcomed the Potsdam Declaration. They marched through the streets of Tokyo and Osaka with red flags. The police had no right to shoot at them. The left-wing newspapers called the Emperor by his first name—Hirohito, as if calling an ordinary rickshaw puller!... But what was most intolerable was the demonstration of the Red elements demanding that the government distribute relief rice to the starving people. The demonstrators broke through several police cordons and broke into the Emperor's inner palace and went to the kitchen to inspect. Several photographers followed in with cameras, and soon the Tokyo Workers' Club showed a documentary short film called "We're Starving, Hirohito is Bloated!"—every inch of the film deserves to have the producer torn apart! Another example is the record of a large strike against the unwarranted dismissal of workers: The American military authorities learned that about two thousand strikers, and workers from other enterprises who supported their unified action, had occupied the film company and turned the place into a formal "stronghold." A group of left-wing film directors led by a certain Kamei Sumio designed a series of cunning traps as their "defenses." If there was a police raid, the film ventilators pressed on large buckets of paint in front of the building would splash paint into the eyes of the people who came, sawn-off trees would smash their heads from above, and bags of broken glass would pour down from the roof and windows like heavy rain.
    On the morning that the American military authorities decided to occupy this "stronghold" by force, the reactionaries dispatched armored vehicles, tanks, and even an airplane, as well as fully armed American military police and Japanese police. They surrounded the film company densely. Crowded in the group of officers commanding the attack, "Hiropon" saw that the roof near the gate was piled with bricks, large wheels, and wooden boxes, the barbed wire around the courtyard was electrified, and a unified command could be heard from outside the wall with a loudspeaker... But when the striking masses clearly saw that the enemy's intention was to undermine the continuation of the strike with a large-scale bloody incident, they immediately changed their struggle strategy, holding high the red flag, singing the Internationale, and rushing out of the encirclement neatly in rows of four, avoiding a military conflict that was unfavorable to them, thus shifting their position and preserving their strength. In such short descriptions, Roman Kim demonstrated the organized, well-led large-scale mass movement, and wrote about the power of the people.
    The author enthusiastically praised the fighting Korean people for their staunch patriotism. The optimism and arduous spirit of the Korean guerrillas described at the beginning and end of the work, the female prisoner "Zoya-4" who was tortured day and night by Hashiberger but always maintained silence and dignity, the Pyongyang girl who pulled the grenade in a bouquet of flowers and blew up dozens of American devils who were "celebrating victory"... all left a deep impression. It was such heroic people that made the invaders unable to understand until their death why they had such a strong will.
    In Roman Kim's excellent work, the contrast between the brutality and shamelessness of imperialism and the justice and strength of the world's people's democratic camp is very clear, and the work also clearly points out that victory will inevitably belong to the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    [2] "Hiropon" is a stimulant containing toxins, similar to heroin; because this special agent is addicted to this substance, "Hiropon" is used as a contact code in the latter half of the diary.

    读“在顺川发现的一本日记”
    江还
    苏联作家金罗曼（Roman　Kim）的“在顺川发现的一本日记”〔一〕是一部有教育意义的小说。这部小说描写了美国强盗在朝鲜的溃败，并以主要篇幅全盘地暴露了美、日反动派处心积虑、一贯准备反苏反共战争的阴谋，其中包括着对和平人民使用细菌武器的罪恶计划。作者以丰富的历史知识和深刻的洞察能力，揭示了从第二次世界大战到朝鲜战争的国际形势发展变化的过程。这部小说中的触目惊心的血腥的事实告诉我们：必须和这些人类共同的死敌进行坚决的斗争，要粉碎他们的阴谋，砍断他们的血手，保卫人类的持久和平。
    小说采用了日记的体裁，作者介绍说，这是一本中朝人民解放顺川时缴获的日本特务的日记。日记的主人——一个终生在中国和朝鲜从事特务活动、代号“希洛本”〔二〕的刽子手——从自己的日本军国主义分子的反动立场，观察、记录了在美国扶日反苏、进攻大陆的政策下“日本帝国”和他本人的命运的变化。从日记中记载的“希洛本”和美国特务哈希伯格尔的关系中，表现了美、日反动势力从“狗咬狗”到狼狈为奸的发展过程。
    在这些记载中，作者组织了丰富的历史材料，速写了许多人物的形象，揭示了第二次世界大战前后国际形势的变化。
    小说所列举的事实，揭露了美帝国主义企图发动反苏战争的罪恶阴谋。杜鲁门一九四五年上台之后就准备迅速对日媾和，以便筹划反苏战争。蒋介石派往东京的密使缪斌，就是表示国民党反共决心并为美、日牵线的中人。另一方面，在日本反动派也企图赶快结束战争，以便“保存实力”，在不久的将来联美攻苏，并对国内工人运动进行镇压。这样，当苏联在西方战场胜利地直捣法西斯老巢的时候，美、日的反动统治者都日益感到彼此的交战是一个“愚蠢的”、“悲剧性的错误”，而正在策划以对苏侵略来解决彼此的利益矛盾。所以，第二次世界大战的烽火未熄，帝国主义已经又在暗中盘算着进攻苏联的战争。直到后来，小说的主角“希洛本”写道：他才逐渐明白美机仅仅轰炸东京的贫民窟而不触及繁华的商业区的道理，以及在苏联对日宣战的前两天美国使用原子炸弹的意义。这里就有着美帝国主义的真正意图。
    苏联出兵远东的时候，那些在垂死的疯狂挣扎中的日本军阀竟认为“帝国的武士们二十年来的梦想终于开始实现了，对苏战争开始了！”很久以来，他们就试验着一种“秘密武器”——在日本的新潟、北海道的细菌试验所，以及在哈尔滨附近平房车站的“七三一部队”和“新京”（长春）附近孟家屯的“一○○部队”，都已能“成功地”制造石井四郎发明的细菌弹。日寇把希望寄托在这样的武器上。他们用疯狂的梦幻来“安慰”自己的灭亡，他们造谣说：“在十七个西伯利亚城市中投掷了细菌弹！”他们欢呼：“天皇陛下万岁！”………然而，事实终于粉碎了一切疯狂幻想，平房和孟家屯的试验所没有来得及制出新鲜适用的细菌弹就被毁掉，强大的苏联部队以雷霆万钧之势击溃了关东军，日本无条件投降了！美帝国主义的阴谋是老早显露出来了的；美军指挥部向日本提名的两个前去接洽投降事宜的人选——日军副参谋总长河边和前关东军参谋长竺原，都是曾在莫斯科作过“武官”的“著名苏联情报专家”。
    美国破坏波茨坦公告和协定，独断专行地实行保存日本军国主义势力的政策，是处心积虑、无微不至的。“希洛本”在乡间“隐蔽”的期间，发现持着假证件的所谓“失去了记忆”的“病人”绝不止他一个，而美国宪兵对他们备加保护。及至回到东京，“希洛本”在街上更时常碰到以前军队中的熟人——一次遇见曾在平、津一带杀人如麻的繁野在卖报纸，另一次碰到以在关岛非刑拷打俘虏而著名的松屋，他正踏着一辆载着一位美国老太太的三轮车。从井伊那里，“希洛本”得知以前的空军军官联合会现在原封不动地变成了“农业合作社”，“酵母肥料公司”是石原领导的“东亚联盟”的化身，“三轮车合作社”是前陆、海军军官的组织……等等。无线电里以寻人广告之类的播音，传达各军事团体秘密集会的时间地点。为了防人耳目（特别不方便的是盟军最高指挥部中有着苏联的代表），日本存在着一种特殊的“地下组织”——一种被最高当局批准和支持着的“地下组织”。然而，这一切的措施是不能欺瞒住人民的，国外的进步新闻社不久就揭露了他们的“秘密”。
    可是，在日本以外的东方局势却发生着根本的、震撼世界的变化。在中国大陆上，不仅日本按着隅田、冈村宁次与阎锡山、何应钦的秘密协定给予国民党反动派的“军事协助”没有发生实际作用，就是美国自己的“支援”，也没有挽回蒋介石的溃败。但美帝国主义是不甘失败的，它明目张胆地招兵买马，企图作最后的挣扎。美国命令日本按照蒋介石的要求，供给陆军、飞行员、坦克手、炮兵……。但是日本反动派当局较之派部队到大陆去，更乐于接受出兵台湾的“建议”，因为他们也觉得，前者好似“从茶壶嘴里往火山上浇水”，已经无补于事，而后者则可能“收复”台湾，重入“帝国”版图。与此同时，美帝国主义扩大了它的“间谍网”，布置了向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略战争。在这部小说里，详细地记载了美国罪魁和他在日本、朝鲜、台湾的喽啰们，在战后不到五年的时间内，怎样完成了各方面的阴谋部署，发动了新的战争。
    值得特别提起的，是这部小说中揭露的美帝国主义进行细菌战的准备和计划。在进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之前，战犯石井四郎和若松次郎的“周密”的细菌战计划就呈交了美国参谋部，而且得出“最后的方案”。“希洛本”有一次“晋谒”麦克阿瑟的时候，他亲眼看到了石井四郎，后者据说是麦克阿瑟在伯力细菌战犯审判的时候一手包庇救了出来的。和他一同晋见麦克阿瑟的小谷将军凑在他耳边轻轻地说：“石井不久就要到美国去了，到华盛顿附近狄特利克营的伍尔泼特实验室去工作！”后来（美军仁川登陆后），在平壤的一个集中营里，“希洛本”发现一批美国生物学家和毒药学家在以俘虏实验几种新的菌苗，包括石井四郎的“1—8”和“1—11”液在内。他们发现注射了“1—11”液的女人要比男人晚死三十二秒钟，如果注射“1—8”液就早死十七秒钟。这本日记赤裸裸地写出了美、日战犯甘冒天下之大不韪，准备使用为国际公法与正直人类所不容的细菌武器的灭绝人性的罪恶阴谋。
    除了和盘托出美、日、蒋、韩阴谋反苏反共的罪行之外，小说也通过特务“希洛本”的记载，透露了日本、朝鲜人民的英勇斗争的情况，以及反动派之间的矛盾。
    “希洛本”和哈希伯格尔虽然共同干着罪恶的勾当，但是两人之间始终保持着敌意，而且不止一次像两条恶狗似地互相露出獠牙，辱骂甚至动起手来。至于对待“大韩”的傀儡与仆从，美、日新旧侵略者更是十分轻蔑。在从水原溃退的混乱中，“希洛本”抢上李承晚的“高级官员”的汽车，毫不在意地顺手就枪杀了一个“大韩”官员，这就足以说明这种“同盟”的关系。
    作者通过“希洛本”这个特务的口吻，透露了日本、朝鲜的人民对帝国主义和国内反动派的斗争的实况。例如提到日本刚刚投降的国内劳动人民对事变的反应时，特务“希洛本”愤怒而懊丧地写道：
    内部的敌人热烈地欢迎了波茨坦宣言。他们在东京和大阪的街上拿着红旗游行。警察无权向他们开枪。左翼的报刊称呼天皇时仅仅叫他的名字——裕仁，就好像称呼一个普通的三轮车夫一样！……但是令人最不能容忍的却是赤色分子要求政府给饥民发救济米的示威游行。游行者冲破了几重警察封锁线，闯进皇上的内宫，跑到厨房里去视察。几个摄影师带着摄影机跟了进去，不久东京的工人俱乐部里就演出了一部名叫“我们挨饿，裕仁胀死！”的纪录短片——片子的每一寸都值得叫制片者受到五马分尸的极刑！再如关于一次反对无故解雇工人的大罢工的纪载：美国军事当局得悉约有两千罢工者，和声援他们一致行动的别的企业的工人，已经占据了电影公司，把那地方变成了一个正式“据点”。由某龟井澄雄领导的一群左翼电影导演们，设计了一系列的诡诈的圈套，作为他们的“防御工事”。如果发生警察捕人的袭击，楼房前面的按在大桶油漆上的电影扇风器，就会朝着来人的眼睛泼出油漆，锯下的大树会从上面砸他们的头，一袋袋的碎玻璃片会从屋顶和窗户里像大雨似地倾下。
    在美军当局决定以武力攻占这个“据点”的那个早晨，反动派出动了装甲车、坦克、甚至一架飞机，以及全副武装的美国宪兵和日本警察。他们密密层层地包围了电影公司。挤在指挥进攻的军官群里，“希洛本”看见靠大门的屋顶上堆满着砖头、大车轮子、板箱，院子周围的铁丝网通了电，从墙外可以听到里面在以扩音器进行统一的指挥……。可是当罢工群众明显地看出敌人的意图是要以大规模流血事件破坏罢工的持续时，他们立刻改变了斗争策略，打着大红旗，唱着国际歌，整整齐齐地四人一排冲出了包围圈，避免了对自己不利的武力冲突，这样转移了阵地，保全了力量。就在这样一些简短的描写中，金罗曼表现了有组织、有领导的规模宏大的群众运动，写出了人民的力量。
    对于战斗的朝鲜人民，作者更热烈地歌颂了他们坚贞不屈的爱国主义。作品开头与结尾所描写的朝鲜游击队的乐观主义与坚苦卓绝的精神，日记中那个被哈希伯格尔日夜非刑折磨，但始终保持着沉默与庄严的女俘虏“卓娅—4”，那个在一捧鲜花中拉响了手榴弹，炸死数十个“欢庆胜利”的美国鬼子的平壤女儿……都给人留下深刻的印象。就是这样的英雄人民，使侵略者至死不能理解，为什么他们会有着这样的坚强意志。
    在金罗曼的这部优秀的作品里，帝国主义的残暴无耻和世界人民民主阵营的正义坚强之间的对比是十分鲜明的，作品同时也十分明确地指出了胜利必然属于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营这一边。

    〔二〕“希洛本”（Hiropon）是一种含有毒素的兴奋剂，类似海洛英；这个特务因嗜好此物，在日记后半即以“希洛本”为联络代号。
