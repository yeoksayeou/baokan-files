    Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute's Self-Criticism Regarding Irresponsible Machine Inspection

    To the Editor:

    On March 21st, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Zhang Zhihua, requesting an inspection of the work of the Shanghai Industrial Testing Institute. We have conducted an inspection based on the content of the letter. At the end of last year, our institute sent Liu Dejun to inspect a generator produced by Shanghai Xinchang Electrical Machinery Company. He only performed tests according to the usual regulations but did not inspect the engine and generator's internal and external components. He also did not test the high-voltage insulation performance, as it was not yet a requirement at the time. The heavy-load test time was also insufficient. Therefore, we did not discover the various problems pointed out by the reader, allowing unscrupulous merchants to exploit loopholes.

    From this inspection, we found the following shortcomings in the engine generator testing work: (1) In the past, the testing methods focused on general performance testing, and the testing time was generally set at four hours. However, we failed to strictly enforce the regulations, preventing us from detecting various problems. (2) The testing items were not comprehensive. For example, we only conducted insulation resistance and iron shell temperature rise tests, but not high-voltage insulation tests. (3) We did not include the inspection of internal components and external attachments as part of our work, nor did we pay attention to any changes made to the machine.

    Our institute may face difficulties in conducting detailed inspections of parts and accessories due to equipment limitations. However, we should still take into account general inspections, and especially pay attention to the unscrupulous merchants' use of inferior materials and cutting corners.

    Based on the lessons learned from this experience, we are currently researching improvements to the engine generator testing work. We sincerely accept the reader's valuable suggestions.

### 上海工业试验所对检验机器不负责任的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    上海工业试验所对检验机器不负责任的检讨
    编辑同志：三月二十一日，人民日报发表了读者张治华的来信，要求检查上海工业试验所的工作。我们依照信内所述作了检查。去年年底，我所派刘德骏检验上海鑫昌机电号所出的一台发电机。他只按通常规定进行了试验，但对引擎及发电机的内外部未作检查；对高压绝缘性能，因当时尚未规定，也未试验；对重车的试验时间也是不够的。因此，我们没有发现读者所指出的各种毛病，给奸商钻了空子。
    从这次检查中，我们发现在引擎发电机的试验工作上有下列缺点：（一）过去试验方法，以一般性能试验为主；试验时间一般规定四小时。但我们不能严格执行规定，以致不能发现各种毛病。（二）试验项目不尽完备，如我们只作绝缘电阻及铁壳温升试验，而不作高压绝缘试验。（三）不把内部机件及外附零件的检查工作列入工作项目之内，也不注意机器更动情况。
    我所限于设备条件，对机件和附件的详细检查或有困难；但应该兼顾到一般的检查，尤其应注意奸商的偷工减料。
    我们根据这次经验教训，对于引擎发电机的试验工作，已在研究改进。我们诚恳地接受读者的宝贵意见。
