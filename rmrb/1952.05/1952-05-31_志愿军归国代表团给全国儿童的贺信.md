Dear Children,
Dear Young Pioneers:
    The "June 1st" International Children's Day is here. This is the most joyful festival for children all over the world. Our returning delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army warmly congratulates you on your good health, progress in your studies, and happy spirits!
    During our tour of various parts of the country to convey the situation of the struggle on the Korean front, whether we were in the Heilongjiang area in the Northeast, on Hainan Island in the South, on the Kangzang Plateau in the Southwest, or in the vast border areas of the Northwest, we were surrounded by lively and lovely children and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves who warmly greeted us, shook our hands, and affectionately called us uncles and aunts. Some asked us, "Are General Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai in good health?" Some asked us, "How is life for the Korean children?" Some asked us to tell them stories of battle. We were deeply moved by the children's love for the motherland, their love for the leaders, their love for the Volunteer Army, and their concern for the Korean people.
    Children, in the great movement to resist America and aid Korea, you have done many things for the motherland, for the people, and for our Volunteer Army. You brought into play the strength of the collective, actively participated in labor, and with the results of your labor, plus the money you saved from buying sweets, you donated two "Young Pioneers" fighter planes to support the struggle on the Korean front. During the Spring Festival this year, you participated in a movement to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. You helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers to clean their courtyards and houses, gave them portraits of Chairman Mao, and presented them with lanterns of honor. What’s more, many children patiently helped the children of the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers with their studies and assisted the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers with production. You were very meticulous and thoughtful, and you solved many difficulties for the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. During our visit to various places, they all said with joy, "We had the best and happiest Spring Festival this year!" They urged us: "Tell our children at the front not to worry about things at home and win more great victories!" Dear children, here, on behalf of all the Volunteer Army soldiers, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks for your practical actions to defend peace and your care for the families of the Volunteer Army!
    Dear children, you sent tens of thousands of letters of comfort and countless gifts of comfort to the Korean front. These precious gifts have become a force to encourage the soldiers to fight bravely against the enemy. On the hills full of artillery fire on the Korean front, in the snowy and icy positions, and in the damp basements, the soldiers scrambled to read your letters over and over again, feeling unspeakable excitement in their hearts. Last winter, the first returning delegation of the Volunteer Army brought millions of red scarves given to us by the children to the front. In the valleys filled with wind and snow, they distributed the red scarves one by one to the heroic troops and combat heroes. The soldiers held the red scarves in their hands and couldn't help but shed tears of excitement. Everyone solemnly swore: "In order to protect the happy life of the new generation of the motherland, we must severely annihilate the enemy!" The soldiers went to fight the American devils with their letters of comfort and red scarves, with a hundred times more courage. Some soldiers were wounded in battle, but they insisted on not leaving the front lines. Dear children, your love for us has inspired us to defeat the enemy!
    This time, our delegation visited many children's palaces and youth gardens in the motherland. We saw the models of tractors, trains, tanks, and airplanes you made yourselves. You happily told us your aspirations after you grew up. Some wanted to be aviators, some wanted to be naval warriors, some wanted to be tank drivers, some wanted to be engineers... This fully demonstrates the children's desire and will to defend and build the motherland. Many children also wrote to us, expressing that they must study hard, exercise their bodies, and be ready at all times to fight to defend and build the motherland. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many children selflessly exposed and persuaded their fathers, brothers, uncles, and relatives; the children are all determined to learn from the working class's excellent qualities of cherishing public property and selflessly working for the cause of the motherland. This makes us realize how brave, how intelligent, how healthy, and how lovely the children of the new China are under the education of Chairman Mao. Our motherland contains such a great reserve force, which makes us even more confident that a bright future will appear in the motherland, adding new courage and strength to our whole bodies.
    Dear children, in order to defend the motherland and defend you, we must resolutely smash the attacks of American imperialist planes, artillery, and germ warfare. We will never give up until we carry the struggle to resist America and aid Korea through to the end!
    We hope that you: under the education of our wise leader Chairman Mao, study harder, exercise your bodies, carry forward the spirit of the five loves, be model Young Pioneers, cultivate yourselves to become builders and defenders of the new China, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's great ideals!
    Finally, we wish you eternal happiness, eternal health, and eternal progress!

    志愿军归国代表团给全国儿童的贺信亲爱的小朋友们：亲爱的少年儿童队员们：
    “六一”国际儿童节来到了，这是全世界儿童最愉快的节日，我们志愿军归国代表团热烈地祝贺你们身体健康，学习进步，精神愉快！
    这次我们在祖国各地传达朝鲜前线斗争情况的时候，不论在东北的黑龙江畔，在南方的海南岛上，在西南的康藏高原，在西北辽阔的边疆，到处都有活泼可爱的小朋友们和围着红领巾的少年儿童队员们热情地围着我们，和我们握手，亲热地喊我们叔叔和姑姑，有的问我们：“金日成将军和彭德怀司令员身体好吗？”有的问我们：“朝鲜小朋友生活怎样？”有的要求我们讲战斗故事。小朋友们这样热爱祖国，热爱领袖，热爱志愿军和关心朝鲜人民，使我们受到很大的感动。
    小朋友们，在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，你们为祖国、为人民、为我们志愿军做了许多事情。你们发挥集体的力量，积极参加劳动，以劳动获得的成绩，加上节省下来的糖果钱，捐献了两架“少年儿童号”战斗机，支援了朝鲜前线的斗争。今年春节，你们参加了慰问革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的一件事运动，你们帮助革命烈士家属和革命军人家属打扫庭院和房屋，给他们送毛主席像，送光荣灯，更有许多小朋友耐心地帮助革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的孩子学习，帮助革命烈士家属和革命军人家属生产，你们做得非常细致和周到，替革命烈士家属和革命军人家属解决了许多困难。我们这次在各地访问时，他们都满心欢喜地说：“今年过了一个最好、最快乐的春节！”他们叮嘱我们：“告诉前线的子弟们，家里的事情莫要牵挂，多打几个大胜仗！”亲爱的小朋友们，在这儿，我们要代表全体志愿军战士对你们保卫和平的实际行动和对志愿军家属的关心表示衷心的感谢！
    亲爱的小朋友们，你们把成千成万封慰问信和无数的慰问品寄到朝鲜前线，这些珍贵的礼物成为鼓舞战士们奋勇杀敌的力量。在朝鲜前线炮火纷飞的山头上，在冰天雪地的阵地里，在潮湿的地下室中，战士们争着一遍遍地阅读你们的来信，心里有说不出的兴奋。去年冬天，志愿军第一次归国代表们带着小朋友们送给我们的千万条红领巾到了前线，在弥漫着风雪的山谷里，他们把红领巾一条一条地分送给英雄部队和战斗英雄。战士们握着红领巾，禁不住流下了兴奋的热泪，大家庄严地宣誓：“为了保卫祖国新的一代的幸福生活，我们要狠狠地歼灭敌人！”战士们就揣着小朋友们的慰问信和红领巾，勇气百倍地和美国鬼子作战去了。有的战士在战斗中负了伤，也坚持不下火线。亲爱的小朋友们，你们对我们的热爱，鼓舞着我们战胜了敌人！
    这次，我们代表团在祖国参观了许多儿童宫和少年园，看到你们自己制造的拖拉机、火车、坦克和飞机的模型，你们高兴地告诉我们长大成人后的志愿，有的要做航空员，有的要做海军战士，有的要做坦克手，有的要做工程师……这充分表现了小朋友们保卫祖国、建设祖国的愿望和意志。许多小朋友还写信向我们表示：一定要努力学习，锻炼身体，时刻准备着保卫祖国和建设祖国而奋斗。在
    “三反”“五反”运动中，有不少小朋友大公无私地检举和规劝自己的父亲、哥哥、叔叔和亲戚；小朋友们都立志学习工人阶级爱护公共财物，为祖国事业忘我劳动的优秀品质。这使我们认识到，在毛主席教育下的新中国儿童是多么勇敢，多么聪明，多么健康，多么可爱，我们祖国蕴藏着这样伟大的后备力量，更加使我们相信祖国会出现一个美好的将来，使我们浑身增添了新的勇气和力量。
    亲爱的小朋友们，为了保卫祖国，保卫你们，我们要坚决粉碎美帝国主义的飞机大炮和细菌毒虫的进攻，不把抗美援朝的斗争进行到底，决不罢休！
    我们希望你们：在英明的领袖毛主席的教养下，更加努力学习，锻炼身体，发扬五爱精神，做一个模范的少年儿童队员，培养自己成为新中国的建设者和保卫者，为实现毛主席的伟大理想而努力！
    最后，祝你们永远快乐，永远健康，永远进步！
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团
    五月二十日
