Concerning Several Issues Concerning the Launch of the Agricultural Bumper Harvest Movement
Yang Gengtian, Chairman of the People's Government of Chahar Province

Editor's Note: This article by Yang Gengtian, Chairman of the People's Government of Chahar Province, puts forward many specific suggestions for the patriotic bumper harvest movement in Chahar Province. These suggestions are very good and can be used as a reference for comrades who lead agricultural production in various places.

(1) Chahar Province Has Sufficient Conditions for a Bumper Harvest

The current land yield in Chahar Province is very low, and the potential for increasing production is great. As long as the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer are solved, the yield can be greatly increased. At present, the average yield of dry land in general areas is about one Shi, and the yield of paddy fields is about two Shi. As long as water, fertilizer, and processing are added, the yield can be increased by several Cheng. Last year, the Yang Shunkui mutual aid group of the Da Lian Shu Village labor model had an average yield of 296 Jin per Mu of dry land, and Yang Shunkui himself produced 790 Jin of millet per Mu of bumper harvest, which exceeded the local average yield by five times; Chi Wanku, the labor model of Taishi Village, Yanggao, produced 927 Jin of paddy field millet per Mu, which exceeded the local paddy field yield by more than two times. The above facts show that the potential of the land is very great. On the other hand, Chahar Province does not lack labor (some areas have surplus labor). Therefore, it is entirely possible to solve the problems of land processing, water addition, and fertilizer addition. This year, the bumper harvest groups and households participating in the production increase competition in Chahar Province, as long as they can apply as much fertilizer as possible and cultivate intensively according to the current conditions, then the increase in production will not be 10% or 20%, but 40% or 50%. Therefore, any conservative views should be corrected.

(2) The Issue of Formulating a Bumper Harvest Plan

In different regions, different bumper harvest priorities should be specified according to local specific conditions, and bumper harvest methods should be devised based on the bumper harvest priorities. This should be done in every village, every district, and every county. For example, some villages in Huairen County can plant fruit trees, some villages can plant cash crops, and some villages can develop sideline occupations. Another example is the Chabei Special District (the entire special district has six counties, 1,200 villages, and 680,000 agricultural population). In 1952, it planned to increase the total output value by 100 million Jin of millet. As long as the following three points are grasped, the task can be overfulfilled: (1) In terms of animal husbandry breeding and livestock raising, 50 million Jin of rice can be increased; (2) Carrying out a clean-up campaign to increase the application of 8 million carts of fertilizer (there is a lot of fertilizer in each village, especially a large amount of rotten chaff millet and grass leaves accumulated for many years on the edge of each field, which is very good for fertilizer), at least 50 million Jin of rice can be increased; (3) Planting 1.2 million Mu of flax. As long as the flax skin is well utilized, at least tens of millions of Jin of rice can be increased. At present, the Chabei Special Commissioner's Office should start to study and prepare how to carry out the manure delivery movement for the clean-up campaign, and study and solve the technical problems of peeling flax skins.

In short, as long as the leading organs at all levels are clear in their minds, grasp the key points, and strengthen leadership, it is no problem to complete the plan.

(3) Organize to Achieve the Bumper Harvest Plan

To achieve the bumper harvest plan, it is necessary to organize; at the same time, the bumper harvest competition can promote the mutual aid movement, and the two play a mutually promoting role. After organizing, whether the mutual aid group can be consolidated and developed depends on whether it can achieve a bumper harvest and increase income. Grasping the masses' demand for a bumper harvest, the mutual aid movement can be pushed forward. If various places only simply require numbers, formalism and coercion may occur, and the mutual aid groups developed in this way cannot be consolidated. Grasping the masses' demand for a bumper harvest, the system and methods within the mutual aid group can be gradually improved; otherwise, only talking about the system and methods without achieving a bumper harvest, such a mutual aid group will inevitably collapse. The experience of many villages proves that if one or two or several mutual aid groups in a village do a good job in production, then the mutual aid cooperative organization in this village will achieve rapid development.

In order to further improve and develop the mutual aid cooperative organization and solve the problem of county and district cadres leading the mutual aid cooperative organization, Chahar Province plans to run a short-term training class (equivalent to a meeting) in late May. The participants are mainly county and district cadres who lead the mutual aid cooperative organization, and a number of mutual aid group leaders and agricultural production cooperative leaders will be trained with emphasis. In June, Chahar Province will also hold a meeting of mutual aid group representatives in each county to check spring plowing and sowing and promote summer hoeing work, in order to promote the development of the entire mutual aid movement.

(4) Strengthen the Leadership of the Patriotic Bumper Harvest Movement

Striving for bumper harvests in bumper harvest villages, groups, and households is the lever for achieving the bumper harvest plan of the entire province or county. Therefore, the leadership must be determined to do this work well. There must be a special person responsible for leading the work of these bumper harvest villages, groups, and households, and they are only allowed to do it well, not to do it badly. Bumper harvest villages and villages, groups and groups, households and households should often exchange experiences, learn from each other, and promote each other. The cadres sent there are only allowed to be consultants and secretaries, and cannot replace village cadres, cannot hold too many meetings to cause trouble, and cannot affect the production of village cadres.

(5) Organize Challenge Competition Movement, Conduct Awards in a Timely Manner, and Carry Out the Competition Movement Throughout

In order to create a bumper harvest movement, various places must organize challenge competitions. In order to promote this movement, a judging committee (and a production office unified office) should be established under the production committee from the province to the county. From now on, we must grasp the situation, check the plan, and summarize and report in a timely manner to promote the bumper harvest competition movement. At present, each county can conduct summary inspections and necessary rewards after spring sowing to promote production in the summer and autumn seasons in a timely manner. After autumn, each county must hold a labor model meeting to summarize the achievements of the whole year, commend and award model workers, and promote the bumper harvest movement for the next year. According to the above spirit, the People's Government of Chahar Province has decided to hold a meeting of mutual aid group representatives in late May to check spring plowing and sowing and promote weeding work, and to hold a labor model conference after autumn to cultivate more leaders.

(6) The Bumper Harvest Movement is a Great Reform Movement in Rural Areas

The bumper harvest movement is a very important event, directly related to the lives of millions of farmers and the construction of our country. To carry out the bumper harvest movement, we must first break the masses' conservative, backward, and some masses' fear of increasing the burden, as well as the leading cadres' conservative, tailism ideology; we must specifically help farmers solve the problems of farming technology, and according to certain conditions, plan to run training classes, transmission stations, etc., to teach the use of new farm tools, the application of fine fertilizer, and the methods of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests.

The bumper harvest movement is also a patriotic movement and a political movement in rural areas. If the bumper harvest movement is carried out well, it can drive the democratic movement and cultural movement in rural areas. Therefore, carrying out the bumper harvest movement is not only of great significance economically, but also a political reform movement. For example, Xiyucun Village, Huailai, stipulates that the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month are "Patriotic Days." On this evening, the whole village holds a mass meeting to check the implementation of the patriotic convention, conduct commendations and criticisms, arrange work, and conduct reading and learning and cultural entertainment activities; the village is full of political atmosphere and a new look has emerged. The labor models in some villages in Huairen County pay great attention to reading newspapers and publicizing current affairs. They subscribe to many newspapers. They are not only concerned about national affairs, but also know not to take the bourgeois road (that is, the capitalist road). Since the beginning of spring, Xingchengbao Village, Chicheng, has established a hygiene convention and launched a clean and hygienic movement. Every household, inside and outside the courtyard, is cleaned as if it were the New Year, and it has become a habit every day. Because of the wet and low terrain, Fengzhuang Village affects living. Labor model Ma Yiqian proposed to do a good job in the bumper harvest movement and move the village to a high ridge not far from the village within five years, and planned to build large and small streets, public toilets, schools, etc., which was supported by the masses of the whole village, and the masses of the whole village are striving to achieve this goal as soon as possible.

In short, the political atmosphere and learning atmosphere in rural areas are the political driving force of the bumper harvest movement, while the bumper harvest movement promotes the further development of the political and cultural movements, thus actually leading and improving the political consciousness of the peasants. Therefore, strengthening rural political work is the key to promoting the bumper harvest movement and changing the face of rural areas.

    关于开展农业丰产运动中的几个问题
    察哈尔省人民政府主席　杨耕田
    编者按：察哈尔省人民政府主席杨耕田的这篇文章，对察哈尔省的爱国丰产运动提出了许多具体意见；这些意见都很好，可供各地领导农业生产的同志参考。
    （一）察哈尔省有足够的丰产条件
    察哈尔省目前的土地产量很低，增产的潜在力很大，只要解决了水利和肥料问题，就可大大提高产量。目前一般地区旱地产量在一市石左右，水地产量在二市石左右，只要加水、加肥、加工，便可增产数成。去年大楝树村劳动模范杨顺奎互助组每亩旱地平均产量为二百九十六斤，杨顺奎本人的一亩丰产谷子产了七百九十斤，超过当地一般产量的五倍；阳高太师庄村劳动模范池万库的一亩水地产谷子九百二十七斤，超过当地水地产量二倍以上。以上事实可以说明土地潜在力是很大的。另一方面，察哈尔省的劳动力并不缺乏（有些地区还有剩余劳力），因此，解决土地的加工、加水、加肥问题，是完全可能的。今年察哈尔省参加增产竞赛的丰产组、丰产户，只要能够按照现在的条件，尽可能地多施肥料，精耕细作，那末，增产的数字将不是一成二成，而是四成五成。因此，任何保守的看法都是应当纠正的。
    （二）制定丰产计划问题
    在不同地区，应按当地的具体条件，规定不同的丰产重点，并根据丰产重点，想出丰产办法。一村、一区、一县都应这样作。如怀仁县有些村庄可种植果木树，有些村庄可种植经济作物，有些村庄可发展副业。又如察北专区（全专区六个县，一千二百个村，六十八万农业人口）一九五二年计划增产总值为一亿斤小米，只要抓紧以下三条，就可超额完成任务：（1）在繁殖畜牧、家畜饲养方面，可增产五千万斤米；（2）开展清洁大扫除运动，增施肥料八百万车（各村肥料很多，特别是每个场边都有数年积存的大批烂秕谷子、草叶子，做肥料很好），最少可增产五千万斤米；（3）种葫麻一百二十万亩，只要很好地把葫麻皮利用起来，最少可增产数千万斤米。目前察北专署就应着手研究和准备如何进行清洁大扫除的送粪运动，并研究解决剥葫麻皮的技术问题。
    总之，各级领导机关只要心里有数，抓住重点，加强领导，完成计划是不成问题的。
    （三）组织起来实现丰产计划
    要实现丰产计划，就必须组织起来；同时丰产竞赛又能推动拨工互助运动，两者之间起着互相推动的作用。组织起来后，互助组能否巩固和发展，决定关键在于能否丰产和增加收入。抓住了群众的丰产要求，互助运动就可以向前推进一步。各地如果只单纯要求数字，就很可能发生形式主义和强迫命令的现象，这样发展起来的互助组也不能巩固。抓住了群众的丰产要求，互助组内的制度、办法就可逐渐改进；否则，只讲制度、办法而不能丰产，这样的互助组必然垮台。许多村的经验证明：一个村，有一两个或几个拨工组生产搞好了，那么这个村的互助合作组织，就会得到飞跃的发展。
    为了使互助合作组织进一步提高和发展，并解决县区干部对互助合作组织的领导问题，察哈尔省拟于五月下旬开办一个短期训练班（等于一次会议），参加的人员以领导互助合作组织的县区干部为主，并有重点地训练一批拨工组长和农业生产合作社的负责人。六月间，察哈尔省各县也将召开拨工组代表会议，检查春耕播种和推动夏锄工作，以推进整个拨工互助运动的开展。
    （四）加强爱国丰产运动的领导
    争取丰产村、组、户实现丰产，是实现全省或全县丰产计划的杠杆。因此，领导方面要下决心搞好这一工作。要有专人负责领导这些丰产村、组、户的工作，并且是只许搞好，不许搞坏。丰产村与村、组与组、户与户之间，要经常交流经验，互相学习，互相推动。派去的干部只许当参谋、当秘书，不能代替村干部，不能多开会找麻烦，不能影响村干部的生产。
    （五）组织挑战竞赛运动，及时进行评奖，使竞赛运动贯彻始终
    为了造成丰产运动，各地必须组织挑战竞赛。为了推动这个运动，从省到县都应在生产委员会之下，建立评奖委员会（和生产办公室统一办公）。从现在起就要掌握情况，检查计划，并及时总结、通报，以推动丰产竞赛运动。目前各县都可在春播之后进行总结检查和必要的奖励，以及时推动夏秋两季的生产。秋后各县都须召开劳动模范会议，总结全年成绩，表扬评奖模范，推动明年的丰产运动。根据以上精神，察哈尔省人民政府除决定在五月下旬开一次互助组代表会议，检查春耕播种，推动锄苗工作外，并在秋后召开劳动模范大会，以便培养更多的带头人。
    （六）丰产运动是农村伟大的改革运动
    丰产运动是一件十分重要的大事，直接关连着千百万农民的生活和我们国家的建设。要开展丰产运动，首先必须打破群众的保守、落后和部分群众怕增加负担的思想，以及领导干部的保守、尾巴主义思想；要具体地帮助农民解决耕作技术上的问题，根据一定条件，有计划地开办训练班、传授站等，传授新式农具的使用方法、细肥施用法以及防除病虫害的方法等。
    丰产运动，也是爱国运动和农村的政治运动，丰产运动开展得好，就可以带动农村的民主运动和文化运动。因此，开展丰产运动，不光在经济上有着重要意义，而且也是一个政治改革运动。如怀来西榆村规定每月旧历初一、十五为“爱国日”。这天晚上全村开群众大会，检查爱国公约的执行情形，进行表扬批评，布置工作，进行读报学习和文化娱乐活动；村中充满了政治气氛，出现了崭新的面貌。怀仁县有些村庄的劳动模范，都十分注意读报和宣传时事，他们订的报很多。他们不只是关心国家大事，而且都知道不走资产阶级道路（即资本主义道路）。赤城兴城堡村入春以来订立了卫生公约，开展了清洁卫生运动，家家户户、院里院外，打扫得和过新年一样，天天如此，已成习惯。冯庄村因为地势湿洼，影响居住。劳动模范马益谦提出搞好丰产运动，在五年内把村庄移到离村不远的高岗地上，并计划建设大小街道，公共厕所，学校等，得到全村群众的拥护，全村群众都为争取早日实现这个目标而奋斗。
    总之，农村的政治空气和学习空气，是丰产运动的政治动力，而丰产运动则又推动了政治、文化运动的进一步开展，这样实际上就领导和提高了农民的政治觉悟。因此，加强农村政治工作，是推动丰产运动、改变农村面貌的关键。
