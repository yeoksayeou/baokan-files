Comrade Editor:

Liu Jixian, a worker in the Yuan Che (lathe team) of the Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau, received a great education in the “Three-Anti” struggle and resolved to increase production efficiency to a high level to repay Chairman Mao. Originally, it was very difficult for this team to tap threads on drill pipes because the drill pipes were four feet longer than the lathe, and the lathe could not accommodate them. They had to remove the small tool holder, place the drill pipe in the position of the tool holder, and then install the tool holder on the belt pulley to tap threads on the drill pipe. This method was inefficient, the tool tip was prone to breaking, and it was easy to produce defective products. Liu Jixian thought: If we could find another small lathe and connect it to the original tool holder, we could solve the difficulty of the drill pipe being long and the lathe being short. He discussed this idea with other workers, and everyone said, "Okay!" He immediately found a small eight-foot-long lathe from the scrap pile, connected it to the large lathe, and connected the two tool holders. Then, he took the tool from the tool holder of the large lathe and installed it on the tool holder of the small lathe. In this way, once the lathe was started, the empty tool holder of the large lathe drove the tool holder of the small lathe, accurately tapping threads on the drill pipe. This method doubled the work efficiency, eliminated defective products, and the tool tip was not damaged.

    焦作矿务局工人刘继先
    改进生产工具提高效率一倍
    编辑同志：焦作矿务局元车班工人刘继先，在
    “三反”斗争中受到很大的教育，下决心把生产效率提得高高的，来报答毛主席。这个班原来挑钻探管螺丝扣非常困难，因为钻探管比车床长四尺，车床放不下。他们只好把小刀架拿掉，把钻探管放在刀架的位置上，再把刀架安在皮带轮盘上，挑削钻探管螺丝扣。这种作法的效率低，刀尖又容易断，还容易出废品。刘继先想：要是再找一座小车床，把它和原来的刀架接起来，就能够解决钻探管长、车床短的困难。他把这个想法和别的工人商量，大家都说：“行！”他马上从废料堆里找出一座八尺长的小车床，和大车床联在一起，把两座刀架接起来；再取下大车床刀架上的刀，安在小车床的刀架上。这样，一开动车头，大车床的空刀架就带动小车床的刀架，准确地挑削钻探管螺丝扣。这个办法使工作效率提高一倍，而且消灭了废品，刀尖也不受损失。    任生焕
