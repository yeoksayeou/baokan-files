Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" Published Ten Years Ago
Zhou Yang

    Ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong published his brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." In this speech, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the correct direction for the development of revolutionary literature and art—the direction that literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To realize this direction, all progressive and revolutionary literary and art workers must establish a communist worldview and outlook on life, and master correct ideological methods and creative methods. Only in this way can literature and art truly combine with the masses of workers and peasants and with the class struggle of the masses.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" brilliantly applied Marxist literary and artistic theory to the Chinese environment and creatively developed it, and modeled the close integration of literary and artistic theory and literary and artistic policy. This work has not only become a combat program for the Chinese people's literary and artistic movement, but has also exerted a guiding influence and role on the revolutionary literary and artistic movements of the people of the world.
    Before the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, what was the central key to the many problems that occurred and existed in literary and artistic work? Comrade Mao Zedong solved the problem of literature and art just as he solved all problems of the Chinese revolution, powerfully grasping the decisive link in the entire chain. In his "Talks," he clearly stated at the outset: "For whom are our literature and art intended?" Such a fundamental and principled question. In response to our literary and art workers, most of whom were from petty-bourgeois intellectual backgrounds, he further sharply raised the question: Is our literature and art primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or is it primarily for the petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals belonging to the petty-bourgeois category? Comrade Mao Zedong replied clearly and affirmatively: it must first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Because China is a vast petty-bourgeois country, petty-bourgeois literary and art workers are an important force on the entire literary and art front. The new literary and artistic works since the May Fourth Movement have mainly depicted petty-bourgeois intellectuals and have been primarily directed at them. Now, proposing that literature and art first serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers will inevitably cause a fundamental historical change in China's new literature and art, and at the same time, it will inevitably prepare for the long-term ideological transformation and ideological criticism of a large number of literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois intellectual backgrounds.
    Comrade Mao Zedong correctly pointed out the necessity and long-term nature of the ideological transformation of petty-bourgeois literary and art workers. Because without ideological transformation, petty-bourgeois literary and art workers cannot correctly express the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cannot serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The combination of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and the masses of workers and peasants must go through a long and arduous process.
    Petty-bourgeois intellectuals were the first awakened elements in the Chinese democratic revolution, and they played a glorious role as pioneers in a certain historical period. When these intellectuals had not yet combined with the masses of workers and peasants, their struggle against the forces of the old society could only take the form of individual resistance. Those among them who were truly willing to make progress tried their best to find the masses, because only by combining with the masses could they have reliance and a way out. These people finally found the working class and resolutely joined the ranks of the struggle of this most advanced class in history, combining their fate with the fate of this class. At this time, they showed new and unlimited strength in their thinking and art. This is the path taken by many progressive literary and art workers since the May Fourth Movement, represented by Lu Xun. They made great contributions to the cause of the Chinese people.
    The process of combining with the masses was full of hardships for literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois intellectual backgrounds. A small number of them were never able to combine with the masses and were eventually abandoned by the people. When intellectuals are to combine with the masses of workers and peasants not only from abstract faith and theoretical concepts, but also from practical actions and the thoughts and feelings of daily life, this combination is not so easy. Petty-bourgeois intellectuals mostly have a history of individual struggle, and this history sometimes becomes a burden in their progress. They have long been accustomed to working alone or in very small groups in their lives, and in terms of literary and artistic cultivation, they are often deeply influenced by bourgeois literature and art centered on individualism. All these conditions have cultivated the unique individualistic psychology and habits of petty-bourgeois intellectuals, hindering their progress and hindering their combination with the masses of workers and peasants. Before undergoing serious ideological transformation, no matter how much petty-bourgeois intellectuals praise the masses in words and how much they express their willingness to get close to the masses, they often despise the masses in practice and are content to be detached from the masses. They are full of intellectual prejudices, illusions, and fantasies; they always regard the individual as more important than the masses; and when they express the workers and peasants, they either portray the images of the workers and peasants as the dull-headed figures they imagine, or they portray them as completely petty-bourgeois, fanatical, and neurotic figures. Among many literary and art workers, this individualistic bad habit of petty-bourgeois intellectuals is deeply rooted. This is why Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" so sharply criticized petty-bourgeois thought.
    After the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, due to the ideological transformation of the petty bourgeoisie, the appearance of our literature and art and literary and art workers was renewed, and a new era in the history of Chinese new literature and art began. However, the ideological transformation of the petty bourgeoisie is long-term. After ten years, we are now proposing the ideological transformation of literary and art workers on a national scale, and starting from the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" last year, we have carried out correct criticism of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought in literature and art.
    Due to the fact that we entered the cities after the national victory, and that we cooperated with the bourgeoisie in politics, the influence of bourgeois thought around us has increased. Strengthening the criticism of bourgeois thought has become a more urgent and serious task in our literary and artistic work. A large number of literary and art workers in the cities who have not undergone transformation have brought their various petty-bourgeois and bourgeois thoughts into the revolutionary literary and art ranks, and some literary and art workers who have undergone preliminary ideological transformation but retain more old consciousness easily accepted the influence of bourgeois thought after entering the cities. Being divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, and indulging in personal enjoyment and a comfortable life; despising revolutionary literature and art, despising the achievements of literature and art in the liberated areas since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, despising national traditions and folk literature and art, and being obsessed with Western techniques—these are all manifestations of the influence of bourgeois thought. This is the temptation of the bourgeoisie from the spiritual aspect. There are also temptations from the material aspect. Because in the city, under the flattery and enticement of some cultural merchants (publishers, theater owners, etc.), some weak-willed and vain people have generated the desire to pursue fame and fortune. These people have forgotten that literature and art is a noble spiritual weapon for educating the people, and they use shoddy works to hunt for money and cater to the needs of the market. They regard cultural enterprises, such as theaters, as a means of purely making profits; they mistakenly place the economic income of these enterprises above the interests of the cause of educating the people. They do not impose necessary supervision and leadership on private cultural enterprises that are purely for profit, but adopt a laissez-faire policy; and even in dealing with these private cultural enterprises, they gradually become infected with vulgar commercial habits. They only see the old connections between old art (opera, comic strips, etc.) and old audiences and readers (mainly petty citizens)—conceding to and catering to the backward thinking and low tastes of the audience is one of the means of this connection—and they do not see the changes in the audience. The new audience has increased, and the old audience has progressed. After the old art is reformed, it should strive to establish connections with the new audience—in the city, it should first be the working class—and instill progressive thinking and proper tastes in all kinds of audiences. Under the various ideological and material temptations of the bourgeoisie, the idea of personal fame and gain has grown in the minds of some literary and art workers, leading themselves and the literary and artistic cause onto the path of degeneration. All these erroneous phenomena have begun to be corrected through the great struggle of "Three-Anti's" and "Five-Anti's." This cannot but remind me of Lenin's famous definition of the principle of party spirit in literature, which he put forward in 1905: "For the socialist proletariat, literary work should not only not be a tool for individuals or groups to make money, but generally speaking, it cannot be a personal undertaking unrelated to the overall cause of the proletariat… Literary work should become a part of the overall cause of the proletariat…" These words have particularly fresh and realistic significance for us today. The entire spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" also starts from this basic principle.
    Our literary and art ranks are a united front of literary and art workers from various strata on the political basis of the Common Program of the People's Political Consultative Conference, mainly the alliance of working-class and communist literary and art workers and petty-bourgeois, that is, general revolutionary democratic literary and art workers. Since socialist factors that play a decisive role have emerged in all aspects of our country's political, social, and economic life, our literature and art, armed with advanced ideas, should strive to truthfully and prominently reflect these new factors in life, so as to educate workers, peasants, and other working people with the spirit of socialism and communism. The new method of revolutionary art—socialist realism—should become the highest criterion for our creative methods. Comrade Mao Zedong required all revolutionary literary and art workers in his speech to "stand on the position of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people," and communist writers should "stand on the position of the Party, on the position of Party spirit and Party policy." These requirements must be unconditionally followed. At present, petty-bourgeois literary and art workers are more numerous in the literary and art ranks. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, they are more inclined to revolution and more close to the working people. Therefore, they are also more likely to accept the ideas of the working class and communism. However, their intellectual individualism also makes them equally likely to accept bourgeois ideas. Therefore, it is a particularly arduous and important task in our literary and artistic work to strengthen the influence and education of working-class ideas on them, to help them overcome the influence of bourgeois ideas and feudal ideas, so that they can truly, thoughtfully, consciously, rather than falsely, perfunctorily, and reluctantly stand on the position of the working class and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Ideological transformation is to overcome all backward ideas with the advanced ideas of the working class, which includes a person's entire worldview and outlook on life, the change of the entire ideology, emotions, psychology, habits, and tastes; for the transformed, it must go through a considerable period of intense and painful inner struggle. The length of this process and the size of the pain depend on the individual's subjective awareness and the degree of effort. Those who regard ideological transformation as a "fashion" and a child's play, and thus simplify and vulgarize ideological transformation, will not understand this. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "To completely solve this problem, it will take at least ten or eight years." But at the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong firmly and positively pointed out: "No matter how long the time is, we must solve it, we must solve it clearly and thoroughly."
    The ideological transformation of literary and art workers cannot be separated from their life practice and their creative practice; that is to say, ideological transformation cannot be carried out behind closed doors; nor must it be necessary to wait until ideological transformation is completely completed before creating. Ideology, life, and creation must be unified on the basis of the literary and art worker's own labor and experience. Actively participating in the actual struggle of the masses is the key to thoroughly transforming one's own thinking, truly combining one's own creation with the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with the class struggle of the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong gave a completely strict materialist explanation of the relationship between literature and art and society. He regarded people's lives as the source of literature and art—and the only source. He said:
    "Whether it is a literary and artistic work as an ideological form of any class, it is the result of the reflection and processing of people's lives in human minds. Revolutionary literature and art is the result of the reflection and processing of people's lives in the minds of revolutionary writers. There are literary and artistic minerals in people's lives. This is a natural form, a rough thing, but it is also the most vivid, the richest, and the most basic thing. They make all processed forms of literature and art pale in comparison. They are the inexhaustible and inexhaustible unique source of all processed forms of literature and art. This is the only source, because there can only be such a source, and there is no second source."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's provision on the correct relationship between literature and art and people's lives fully demonstrates his most thorough materialist aesthetic view. Comrade Mao Zedong's rich thoughts on historical and dialectical materialism, which he elaborated in his two great philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," provide all literary and art workers who stand on the position of proletarian realism with the best and most powerful theoretical weapons.
    However, Comrade Mao Zedong did not in the least belittle the important role of literature and art because he emphasized the primary significance of people's lives. He said:
    "Although natural forms of literature and art (Mao Zedong here refers to people's lives) are the only source of ideological forms of literature and art, and although they have incomparably vivid and rich content compared to the latter, the people are still not satisfied with the former but require the latter. Why is this? Because although both are beautiful, the processed literature and art is more organized, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than the natural form of literature and art, so it is more universal."
    Since people's lives are the only source of literature and art, literary and art workers must devote themselves to this source. Comrade Mao Zedong's call to all revolutionary and progressive literary and art workers is worth reviewing often and remembering forever:
    "Chinese revolutionary writers and artists, promising writers and artists, must go to the masses, must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in a long-term, unconditional, and wholehearted way, to the fiery struggle, to the only and most extensive and richest source, to observe, experience, study, and analyze all people, all classes, all masses, all vivid forms of life and forms of struggle, all natural forms of literature and art, and then it is possible to enter the processing process, that is, the creative process, so as to unite raw materials and production, the research process and the creative process. Otherwise, your labor will have no object, no raw materials or semi-finished products, and you will have nowhere to process, and you can only be the kind of empty-headed writer or empty-headed artist that Lu Xun repeatedly told his son in his will not to be."
    Since the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the entire experience of the literary and artistic movement has proved that our literary and artistic work is always full of vigor and clear direction when it is closely linked to the masses, and that once this connection is lost or weakened, it immediately becomes lifeless, directionless, and even stagnates and becomes paralyzed. At the same time, it also proves that when we faithfully implement the literary and artistic line indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, we will succeed, and that once we deviate from this line, we will suffer failure. Over the past ten years, many important achievements that we have already made in our literary and artistic work—Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," Zhou Libo's "Hurricane," and He Jingzhi and Ding Yi's opera "The White-Haired Girl," which recently won the Soviet Stalin Prize, are all inseparable from the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction.
    At present, the root cause of the serious phenomenon that literary and artistic creation lags far behind the great struggle of our people and national construction is that a considerable number of literary and art workers have been divorced from reality and the masses for a considerable period of time. Since Beijing launched a literary and artistic rectification campaign last year, this situation has begun to improve.
    The backwardness of literature and art is mainly not in terms of the quantity of works, but in terms of quality. Literature and art do not portray new people and new lives forcefully enough; they do not reflect the aspects of people's lives widely enough; and the works lack the power to move and inspire people as they should. That is to say, there is a serious tendency towards conceptualization and formulaization in creation. This is a harmful anti-realist tendency. If this tendency is not opposed and corrected, it will greatly hinder the progress and development of the literary and artistic cause. We have criticized various obvious distortions in the expression of the new lives and new people of the masses that come from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, or even from feudal ideas. This is completely necessary, and we must continue this criticism in the future. However, we have tolerated a most common and massive distortion that exists and seems to be "legitimate"—the tendency towards conceptualization and formulaization. Conceptualized works write the very rich, vivid, and fresh things in people's lives into monotonous, dull, and formulaic clichés; they write people who originally have flesh and blood, have thoughts and personalities, and act according to their own will in a certain environment into people who have no flesh and blood, no personality, no thoughts, and are completely manipulated by the author, like puppets; they write originally complex and serious political struggles into simple child's play. Aren't all these great distortions? Are such distortions permissible?
    The main reason why the tendency towards conceptualization and formulaization can exist "legally" without being criticized, and sometimes even being encouraged, is that literary and art workers and some leaders of literary and artistic work misunderstand the correct relationship and true meaning of literature and art serving politics. Our literature and art must serve politics; it must take the policies of the Party and the government as a guide. This is certain and unshakable. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Since art serves the class and serves the Party, it must of course serve the political requirements of the class and the Party, and serve the revolutionary tasks of a certain revolutionary period. Leaving this, it leaves the fundamental needs of the masses." Therefore, we must oppose the tendency of literature and art to be detached from politics, which is actually the tendency to make literature and art serve the political interests of the bourgeoisie. But we must also oppose conceptualized and formulaic works, and oppose the manufacture and proliferation of such works under the pretext of serving political tasks, because such works cannot achieve the true purpose of serving politics. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but in turn give great influence to politics." And conceptualized and formulaic works cannot have this influence.
    What exactly is the political task that a literary and artistic work can and should accomplish? The task of literature and art is to truthfully and profoundly describe life, reveal the contradictions in life, create various characters, and show the strength of progressive characters. Only true and vivid characters can attract readers and audiences, move people's hearts, and make them accept the ideas in the works. Comrade Mao Zedong has already correctly pointed out in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Revolutionary literature and art should create all kinds of characters according to actual life to help the masses promote the progress of history." Therefore, literary and art workers must participate in all aspects of actual life and deeply observe, experience, and study people's lives. As Lenin said, politics begins where hundreds of millions of people are located. Without the masses, what serious politics and policies can there be? Without a true description of the lives of the masses and the class struggle of the masses, what real politics and policies can be expressed? The root cause of the failure of conceptualized and formulaic authors is that their creations always start from abstract political concepts, not from the actual lives of the people. They do not pay attention to all aspects of people's lives, especially the daily affairs in the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In these daily lives, the people's new interrelationships, new emotions, and qualities are being produced. When many of our literary and art workers go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they do not pay attention to helping them solve various practical difficulties in their lives in all aspects, and helping them improve in their cultural life, but they want to ask them for things as soon as they reach out, and look for "creative materials." In fact, they regard the interests of their personal creation as much higher than the interests of the masses, so they cannot make friends with the masses, and they cannot hear their heartfelt words. In this way, they can never organically combine the correct transmission of policies and ideas with the true description of the daily lives of the masses, and at the same time, they can never express the true character of the new people. Our literature and art should cultivate the new qualities of the people, especially the younger generation; cultivate their loyalty and love for the motherland and the people, a high degree of labor enthusiasm, the heroic spirit of self-sacrifice, and far-reaching and noble ideals. In our working people, in the combat heroes on the front lines, in the labor heroes on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, and in many outstanding Communist Party members, Youth League members, and staff members of state organs, we have already seen these new qualities. Our literature and art should express these new qualities of these new people as a model for all the people. Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the standard of communist people in his article commemorating "Bethune": a person who has "a spirit without any selfishness" "is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has broken away from vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." If our literary and artistic works truly and vividly write about such people, they can play a role in communist education for people, which is the best way to complete political tasks. Conceptualized and formulaic writers do not pay attention to writing about characters. For them, characters exist only for the need to explain a specific policy. In this way, art becomes a simple masquerade lecture; the work becomes a simple illustration of the policy or even a game of political concepts.
    The tendency of anti-realism, when dealing with historical themes, is manifested as the tendency of anti-historicism. Among our historical figures, there have been many heroes, heroines, and people with lofty ideals who resisted internal and external oppressors. As long as their resistance, their strategies and courage, and their loyalty to their beliefs are truly expressed, it will naturally arouse our hatred for the old system and our confidence in a better future for mankind. The authors of anti-historicism insist on writing the actions of ancient figures in accordance with the level of modern thinking and the standards of policies, so that we can learn policies from them. This anti-historicist creative method is also related to the vulgar and narrow understanding of literature and art serving politics.
    The tendency of conceptualization and formulaization thus distorts the correct relationship between literature and art and politics, and thus hinders the true combination of literature and art with the broad masses.
    In his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the possible contradictions between art and politics on the one hand, and demanded the unity of the two on the other. He said:
    "What we require is the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form… An art piece lacking artistry, no matter how politically advanced, is powerless. Therefore, we oppose not only art pieces with harmful content, but also the so-called 'slogan-style' tendency that only talks about content but not about form. We should carry out a two-line struggle on literary and artistic issues."
    At present, we should still carry out these two-line struggles in literary and artistic work, that is, on the one hand, we should oppose the tendency of literature and art to be detached from politics, and on the other hand, we should also oppose the tendency of conceptualization and formulaization.
    The people demand works that have both rich political content and appropriate artistic form, and works that unify ideology and artistry. The form of such works must also be popular. Our literature and art must adopt forms that are loved by the masses and easy for them to accept. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his report to the Enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in 1938: "Marxism must be combined with the specific characteristics of our country and can be realized through national forms... Foreign stereotypes must be abolished, empty abstract tones must be sung less, dogmatism must rest, and replaced by fresh, lively, Chinese style and Chinese spirit that are loved by the Chinese people." In 1940, he said again in "On New Democracy": "Chinese culture should have its own form, that is, national form."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's most correct and scientific provision on the relationship between popularization and improvement in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is one of the most creative parts of Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic theory. Since literature and art are primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, popularized literature and art should be placed in the most important position. If literature and art do not adopt forms that are loved by the masses and easy for them to accept, they cannot be popularized to the masses, and at the same time, they cannot achieve the true improvement of literature and art. The literature and art of each nation should have national forms that express the characteristics of their own nation. Moreover, China is a great nation with a population of 500 million and a long cultural history of about 4,000 years. Its literature and art must have its own unique national forms. Therefore, the popularization and nationalization of our literature and art have particularly important significance. Over the past ten years, we have followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on national forms and have begun to seriously study the language of the people and folk literature and art. On the basis of this research, we have begun to create some works that truly have "Chinese style and Chinese spirit," and these works have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers and peasants.
    In the issue of form, language has paramount importance. Comrade Mao Zedong gave the most correct and scientific definition of "popularization" in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": Popularization means "the thoughts and feelings of our literary and artistic workers themselves should be integrated with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Then he pointed out: "To be integrated, we should start by learning the language of the masses." Comrade Mao Zedong specially explained the importance of learning the language of the people in his famous speech "Oppose Party Stereotypes." How sharp and ruthless criticisms did he give to those "foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas" gentlemen, those who talk about popularization but are actually for a small number of people, and those writers who, when writing articles, have sentences that are as long as forty or fifty words, filled with what Lu Xun called "adjectives that no one can understand!" The bad tendency of "foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas" still exists seriously in the current literary and artistic work. Its main manifestation is the blind worship of Western bourgeois art and the contempt for the artistic traditions of our own nation and folk literature and art. This tendency of "foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas" is often combined with the tendency of "conceptualization and formulaization" mentioned above, which makes many of our works both empty in content and tasteless in language, bringing the most destructive and harmful results to our art. In addition, some literary and artistic writers inappropriately and arbitrarily use dialects and localisms in their creations, and do not work on processing and refining the language of the people, and do not put in hard work on the language. Some popularized literary and artistic writers are satisfied with using clichés from old feudal literature and art, and do not strive to absorb the fresh and lively language of the people, which is also wrong. We must emphasize the need to fight to protect the purity and health of our national language, and literary and artistic writers should stand at the forefront of this struggle. The language in their works should become a model of the national language.
    The literary and artistic heritage of our nation is extremely rich. In "On New Democracy," Comrade Mao Zedong gave important instructions on the richness of our cultural heritage and how to sort out, inherit, and critically develop these heritages. Many of the heritage and traditions of Chinese national art still live among the broad masses of the people. It still has great and strong vitality, and the people are constantly supplementing and enriching them with their own new creations. Among them, local operas and folk songs are particularly worthy of our attention. Our workers, peasants, and other working people love them. The reason why they love these arts is not only because these forms are familiar to them, but also because these people's artistic creations often break through the shackles of feudal ruling ideology and tortuously express the people's thoughts, feelings, and aspirations. The Chinese feudal class and the bourgeoisie, due to their class limitations, have not been able to fully and correctly use and develop these folk arts; on the contrary, they have distorted and vulgarized them, rejected and despised them. Therefore, these rich folk arts have long been in a despised, spoiled, and therefore underdeveloped pitiful position. We must seriously and systematically collect, sort out, and study these artistic heritages and folk artists' creations that are widely scattered among the people, and transform and improve them on a new basis. Therefore, we must oppose the erroneous tendency to despise national artistic traditions, and oppose the rude attitude towards artistic heritage; at the same time, we must also oppose the conservative tendency not to innovate and not to seek progress.
    On the issue of the relationship between popularization and improvement, Comrade Mao Zedong specially pointed out the necessity of establishing correct relationships between literary and artistic specialists and comrades doing popularization work. He repeatedly told us to value the budding literature and art of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to value the wall newspapers of the masses, the small troupes in the army and the countryside, and the singing of the masses. At that time, because we were still in the rural revolutionary base areas, Comrade Mao Zedong mainly talked about the army and the countryside. Now, the worker masses' literature and art in factories have developed rapidly and vigorously, which should arouse our special attention. All literary and art workers who are truly willing to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers should pay attention to the workers' literature and art. In the urban mass literary and artistic work, we should more firmly implement the principle of serving the workers first.
    Today, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," our literary and art workers should:
    Continue to transform our thinking and continue to criticize the erroneous ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie in literature and art.
    Overcome the tendency of conceptualization and formulaization in literary and artistic creation and fight to master the method of proletarian realism.
    Overcome the tendency of "foreign stereotypes and foreign dogmas" in literature and art that blindly worship Western bourgeois culture, and fight for the further development of national forms in literature and art.
    Let all our literary and art workers unite, closely contact the masses, diligently study our profession, and continue to strive for the direction of literature and art indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong!

    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年
    周扬
    十年以前，毛泽东同志发表了他的天才著作“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”。在这个讲话中，毛泽东同志提出了革命文艺发展的正确方针——文艺必须为工农兵服务的方针。要实现这个方针，一切前进的和革命的文艺工作者必须确立共产主义世界观、人生观，掌握正确的思想方法和创作方法，只有这样才能达到文艺真正和工农群众相结合，和群众的阶级斗争相结合。
    毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，出色地把马克思主义文艺理论具体地运用到中国环境中并创造性地加以发展，模范地使文艺理论和文艺政策紧密结合。这个著作不但成了中国人民文艺运动的战斗纲领，而且对世界人民的革命文艺运动发生了指导的影响和作用。
    在延安文艺座谈会以前，文艺工作上所发生和存在的许多问题，其中心关键何在呢？毛泽东同志解决文艺问题正如他解决中国革命的一切问题一样有力地抓住了整个链条上的有决定性的环节，他在“讲话”中，开宗明义就提出：“我们的文艺是为什么人的？”这样一个根本的、原则的问题。针对我们的大部分是小资产阶级知识分子出身的文艺家，他又进一步尖锐地提出问题：我们的文艺第一是为着工农兵呢，还是第一为着小资产阶级及属于小资产阶级范畴的知识分子呢？毛泽东同志明确地、肯定地答复：第一要为工农兵。由于中国是一个广大的小资产阶级的国家，小资产阶级文艺家在整个文艺战线上是一个重要的力量。“五四”以来的新文艺作品主要就是描写小资产阶级知识分子的，对象也主要地是他们。现在提出文艺第一要为工农兵，这就不能不引起中国新文艺的一个根本的历史性的变化，同时也就不能不准备对大批小资产阶级知识分子出身的文艺工作者进行长期的思想改造和思想批判的工作。
    毛泽东同志正确地指出了小资产阶级文艺工作者的思想改造的必要性和长期性。因为小资产阶级文艺家不经过思想改造，就不能正确地表现工农兵，就不能为工农兵服务。小资产阶级知识分子和工农群众结合必须经历一个长期奋斗的过程。
    小资产阶级知识分子在中国民主革命中是首先觉悟的成分，他们是曾经在一定历史时期中演过先驱者的光荣角色的。这些知识分子，当他们还没有和工农群众相结合的时候，他们对于旧社会势力的斗争，就只能采取个人方式的反抗。他们中间真正愿意进步的人们曾竭力寻找群众，因为只有和群众结合，他们才有依靠和出路。这些人终于找到了工人阶级，并且毅然地参加了这个历史上最先进的阶级的斗争行列，将自己的命运和这个阶级的命运结合起来，这时候，他们在思想上和艺术上就表现了新的无限的力量。这就是以鲁迅为代表的“五四”以来许多前进文艺家所走过的道路。他们对中国人民事业是有极大贡献的。
    小资产阶级知识分子出身的文艺家在和群众结合的过程中，是历尽艰苦的，其中少数人始终没有能够和群众结合而最后被人民所抛弃。当知识分子不只是从抽象信仰和理论概念上，而要从实际行动、从日常生活的思想感情上，去和工农群众结合的时候，这个结合并不是那么容易的。小资产阶级知识分子大都有他们个人奋斗的历史，这个历史有时就成为他们前进中的包袱，他们生活上长期地习惯于单独工作或在很小的集团内工作，而在文艺修养上又往往感染以个人主义为中心的资产阶级文艺的影响较深，这一切条件就养成了小资产阶级知识分子特有的个人主义心理和习惯，妨碍他们的前进，妨碍他们和工农群众的结合。小资产阶级知识分子在没有经过认真的思想改造以前，不管口头上如何称赞群众，如何表示愿意接近群众，实际上常常是轻视群众，并且安于脱离群众的状态的。他们充满知识分子的偏见、错觉和幻想；他们总是看个人重于群众；而在他们表现工农群众的时候，不是将工农的形象描写为他们想像中的呆头呆脑的人物，就是描写为完全小资产阶级化了的、狂热的、神经质的人物。在不少文艺工作者中间，这种小资产阶级知识分子的个人主义的恶习是根深柢固的。这就是为什么毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中特别针对小资产阶级思想进行了那么尖锐的批判的缘故。
    延安文艺座谈会以后，由于经过对小资产阶级的思想改造，我们的文艺和文艺工作者的面貌为之焕然一新，从此就开始了中国新文艺史上的一个新的时代。但是小资产阶级思想改造是长期的，经过十年，我们今天又在全国范围内提出文艺工作者的思想改造，并从去年电影“武训传”批判开始，对文艺上的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想进行了正确的批判。
    由于全国胜利之后，我们进入城市，以及在政治上和资产阶级合作，我们周围资产阶级思想的影响增大等等原因，加强对资产阶级思想的批判，成为了我们文艺工作上更迫切、更严重的任务了。城市中大批没有经过改造的文艺工作者把他们的各种各色小资产阶级、资产阶级思想都带到了革命文艺队伍中来，而一些经过初步思想改造，但保留有较多旧意识的文艺工作者进入城市之后又很容易地接受了资产阶级思想的影响。脱离政治，脱离群众，而沉溺于个人享受的、安逸的生活；轻视革命文艺，轻视延安文艺座谈会以来解放区文艺的成就，轻视民族传统、民间文艺，而醉心于西洋技巧；这些就都是资产阶级思想影响的种种表现。这是资产阶级从精神方面来的诱惑。还有从物质方面来的诱惑。由于在城市，在某些文化商人（出版商、戏院老板等）的奉迎引诱下，就使一些意志薄弱，爱好虚荣的人们产生了追求名利的欲望。这些人忘记了文艺是一种教育人民的高尚精神武器，而以粗制滥造的作品去猎取金钱和迎合市场的需要。他们掌握了文化企业，如戏院等，作为单纯营利的手段；错误地把这些企业的经济收入的利益放在对人民教育的事业的利益之上。他们对于完全以营利为目的的私营文化企业，不加以必要的监督和领导，而采取自由放任的方针；甚至在与这些私营文化企业打交道的当中，逐渐沾染上庸俗的商业化的习气。他们只看到旧有艺术（戏曲、连环画等）和旧有观众、读者（主要是小市民）的旧的联系——迁就和迎合观众的落后思想和低级趣味，就是这种联系的手段之一——而没有看到观众的变化。新的观众增加了，旧的观众进步了。旧有艺术经过革新之后，应当努力和新的观众——在城市应当首先是工人阶级——去建立联系，灌输所有各种观众以前进思想和正当趣味。就在资产阶级的种种思想的和物质的诱惑之下，个人名利的思想在一部分文艺工作者的头脑中间滋长起来，把他们自己和文艺事业一齐引到堕落的道路上去。这一切错误现象经过“三反”“五反”的伟大斗争已开始得到纠正。这就不能不使我想起列宁在一九○五年所提出的关于文学的党性原则的有名定义：“对于社会主义的无产阶级，文学事业不但不能是个人或集团的赚钱的工具，而且一般讲来，它不能是与无产阶级总的事业无关的个人事业。……文学事业应当成为无产阶级总的事业的一部分……”这段话对于我们今天具有特别新鲜的、现实的意义。毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的整个精神也就是从这个基本原则出发的。
    我们的文艺的队伍是一个在人民政协的共同纲领的政治基础上的，包括了各个不同阶层的文艺家的统一战线，主要地是工人阶级的、共产主义的文艺家和小资产阶级的、即一般革命的民主主义的文艺家的联盟。在我们国家的政治、社会、经济的生活各方面既已产生了具有决定作用的社会主义的因素，我们的以先进思想武装起来的文艺就应努力将这些生活中的新的因素真实地、突出地反映出来，借以用社会主义和共产主义的精神去教育工人、农民及其它劳动群众。革命艺术的新方法——社会主义现实主义应当成为我们创作方法的最高准绳。毛泽东同志在讲话中要求一切革命文艺工作者都“站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场”，而共产党员作家，就更“要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”这些要求是无条件地必须遵从的。目前小资产阶级文艺家在文艺队伍中是人数较多的。正如毛泽东同志所指出的，他们比较地倾向于革命，比较地接近于劳动人民。因而，他们也就比较容易地接受工人阶级、共产主义的思想。但是他们的知识分子的个人主义又使他们同样容易地接受资产阶级的思想。因此，对他们加强工人阶级思想的影响和教育，帮助他们克服资产阶级思想以及封建阶级思想的影响，使他们真正地、经过深思熟虑地、自觉地而不是虚伪地、敷衍地、勉强地站在工人阶级立场为工农兵服务，这就是我们文艺工作上一个特别艰苦的重要的任务。
    思想改造是以工人阶级的先进思想去克服一切落后思想，这就包含了一个人的整个世界观、人生观的改变，整个思想、情感、心理、习惯、趣味的改变；对于被改造者来说，必然要经过一个相当时间的、剧烈的、痛苦的内心斗争的过程，这个过程时间的长短，痛苦的大小，就要看个人主观上自觉的程度和努力的程度来决定了。那些把思想改造当作
    “时髦”，当作儿戏，因而把思想改造简单化、庸俗化的人们，是不会懂得这个的。毛泽东同志指出：“要彻底解决这个问题，非有十年八年的长时间不可。”但是同时毛泽东同志坚决地、肯定地指出：“时间无论怎样长，我们却必须解决它，必须明确地彻底地解决它。”
    文艺工作者的改造思想是和他的生活实践，和他的创作实践不能分开的；这就是说，思想改造不能关起门来进行；也不是一定要等到完全思想改造好了以后才进行创作。思想、生活和创作三者必须在文艺工作者本人的劳动和经验的基础上统一起来。而积极地参加群众的实际斗争，则是彻底改造自己思想，将自己的创作和工农群众的生活，和群众的阶级斗争真正结合起来的关键。毛泽东同志对于文艺和社会的关系作了完全严格的唯物主义的说明，他把人民生活看成是文学艺术的源泉——并且是唯一的源泉。他说：
    “无论是那一等级的作为观念形态的文艺作品，都是人民生活在人类头脑中的反映和加工的结果，革命的文艺，则是人民生活在革命作家头脑中的反映和加工的结果。人民生活中本来存在着文学艺术的矿藏，这是自然形态的东西，是粗糙的东西，但也是最生动、最丰富、最基本的东西，它们使一切加工形态的文学艺术相形见绌，它们是一切加工形态的文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。这是唯一的源泉，因为只能有这样的源泉，此外没有第二个源泉。”
    毛泽东同志的这个关于文学艺术和人民生活的正确关系的规定正表现了他的最彻底的唯物主义的美学观。毛泽东同志在他的两部伟大哲学著作“实践论”和“矛盾论”中所展开的关于历史的和辩证的唯物主义的丰富思想，提供了一切站在无产阶级现实主义立场上的文艺工作者以最好的、最有力的理论武装。
    但是毛泽东同志并没有因为强调人民生活的第一位的意义就丝毫看轻文艺的重要作用。他说：
    “自然形态上的文学艺术（毛泽东这里就是指的人民生活）虽是观念形态上的文学艺术的唯一源泉，虽是较之后者有不可比拟地生动丰富的内容，但是人民还是不满足于前者而要求后者，这是为什么呢？因为虽然两者都是美，但是加工后的文艺却比自然形态上的文艺更有组织性，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。”
    既然人民生活是文学艺术的唯一源泉，文艺工作者就必须投身到这个源泉中去。毛泽东同志向一切革命的和前进的文艺工作者所发出的号召，是值得我们时常温习，永远铭记在心的：
    “中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全身心地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切自然形态的文学和艺术，然后才有可能进入加工过程即创作过程，这样地把原料与生产，把研究过程与创作过程统一起来。否则你的劳动就没有对象，没有原料或半制品，你就无从加工，你就只能做鲁迅在他的遗嘱里所谆谆嘱咐他的儿子万不可做的那种空头文学家或空头艺术家。”
    从“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”以来，文艺运动的全部经验证明：我们的文艺工作，当它和群众联系密切的时候，总是显得生气勃勃的，方向明确的，而一旦失去或减弱了这种联系的时候，就立刻变得没有生气，没有方向，以至陷于停滞和瘫痪的状态。同时也就证明：当我们忠实地执行了毛泽东同志所指示的文艺路线的时候，我们就得到成功，而一旦离开了这个路线的时候，我们就遭受失败。十年以来，我们文艺工作上所已经取得的许多重要成就——最近获得苏联斯大林奖金的丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”，周立波的“暴风骤雨”，贺敬之、丁毅的歌剧“白毛女”，就是这些成就的一部分——都是和毛泽东同志的文艺方向的领导分不开的。
    目前文艺创作远落后于我们的人民的伟大斗争和国家建设的严重现象，其根源就是相当多的文艺工作者相当长时间地脱离实际，脱离群众；从去年北京发动文艺整风以来，这种状况已开始有了好的改变。
    文艺的落后现象，主要还不在作品的量的方面，而是在质的方面。文艺表现新的人物，新的生活不够有力；反映人民生活的方面不够宽广；作品缺少应有的感动人、鼓舞人的力量。这就是说，创作上严重地存在着概念化、公式化的倾向。这是一种有害的反现实主义的倾向。这种倾向，如果不加以反对和纠正的话，就会大大地妨碍文艺事业的前进和发展。我们批判了在表现群众的新的生活和新的人物上从资产阶级、小资产阶级思想而来的或者甚至从封建思想而来的各种明显的歪曲，这是完全必要的，今后还必须继续这种批判的工作。但是我们却容忍了一种最普遍大量存在的，而且似乎是“合法”的歪曲——概念化、公式化的倾向。概念化的作品把人民生活中本来非常丰富的、生动活泼的、新鲜的事物写成单调的、乏味的、千篇一律的公式；把本来是有血有肉的，有思想、有性格的，在一定环境下按照自己的意志行动的人写成没有血肉的，无性格、无思想的，完全任凭作者任意摆布的，像木偶似的人物；把本来是复杂的、严重的政治斗争写成简单的儿戏。这一切难道不都是很大的歪曲吗？这样的歪曲难道是可以容许的吗？
    概念化、公式化的倾向所以能够“合法”存在，没有受到批评，有时甚至受到鼓励，主要原因就是文艺工作者以及一些文艺工作的领导者错误地了解了文艺服从政治的正确关系和真正意义。我们的文艺必须服从政治；必须以党和政府的政策作为指针，这是确定不移的。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中说：“艺术既然服从阶级，服从党，当然就要服从阶级与党的政治要求，服从一定革命时期的革命任务，离开了这个，就离开了群众的根本的需要。”因此我们必须反对文艺脱离政治的倾向，这实际上就是使文艺服从资产阶级政治利益的倾向。但是我们也要反对概念化、公式化的作品，反对在服从政治任务这个藉口之下一任这种作品的制造和泛滥，因为这样的作品，是不能够达到为政治服务的真正目的的。毛泽东同志说：“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给与伟大的影响于政治。”而概念化、公式化的作品是不能发生这种影响的。
    究竟什么是一篇文艺作品所能够和应当完成的政治任务呢？文艺的任务是真实地深刻地描写生活，揭露生活中的矛盾，创造各种人物，显示前进人物的力量。只有真实的、生动的人物才能吸引读者观众，打动人们的心灵，使他们接受作品中的思想。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中已经正确地指出：“革命的文艺应当根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物，帮助群众推动历史的前进”。因此文艺工作者必须参加到实际生活的一切方面去，深刻地去观察、体验和研究人民的生活。正如列宁所说的，政治是开始在千百万群众所在的地方。离开了群众，还能有什么严重的政治和政策呢？离开了群众生活，群众的阶级斗争的真实描写，还能表现得出甚么真正的政治和政策呢？概念化，公式化的作者的失败的根源，就在他们的创作总是从抽象的政治概念出发，而不从实际的人民生活出发。他们不注意人民生活的各方面，特别是不注意工农兵群众生活中的日常事物；在这些日常生活中正产生着人民的新的相互关系，新的情感和品质。我们的许多文艺工作者到工人，农民，士兵群众中去的时候不注意去在一切方面帮助他们解决生活中的各种实际困难，在文化生活上帮助他们提高，而是一伸手就想向他们要东西，找“创作材料”，他们实际上是把自己个人创作的利益看得比群众的利益要高得多，因此他们就不可能在群众中间交上知心朋友，就听不到他们的知心话，这样，他们就永远不可能把政策思想的正确传达和群众日常生活的真实描写有机地结合起来，同时也就永远不可能表现出真实的新的人物的性格。我们的文艺应当培养人民特别是青年一代的新的品质；培养他们对祖国对人民的忠诚热爱，高度的劳动热忱，自我牺牲的英雄气概，远大而高尚的理想。在我们的劳动人民身上，在前线的战斗英雄和工业、农业生产战线上的劳动英雄身上，在许多优秀的共产党员、青年团员和国家机关的工作人员的身上，我们已经看见这种新的品质了。我们的文艺应当表现这些新的人物的新的品质，以作为全体人民的表率。毛泽东同志在纪念“白求恩”的文章中提出了共产主义的人的标准：一个人只要有“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，“就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。我们的文艺作品中如果真实地、生动地写出了这样的人物，就能对人们起共产主义教育的作用，也就是最好地完成了政治任务。概念化、公式化的作家不注意写人物，对于他们，人物仅仅是为了解说某项具体政策的需要而存在的，这样，艺术就变成了简单的化装讲演；作品就变成了政策的简单的图解或者甚至政治概念的游戏了。
    反现实主义的倾向，在处理历史题材的时候，就表现为反历史主义的倾向。我们的历史人物中，曾有不少反抗内外压迫者的英雄豪杰、仁人志士，只要真实地表现出了他们的反抗，他们的谋略和勇敢，以及他们对于自己的信仰的忠诚，就自然会激发起我们对于旧制度的仇恨，和对人类更美好未来的信心。反历史主义的作者却硬要将古代人物的行动写成合乎现代思想的水平和政策的标准，以便我们去向他们学习政策。这种反历史主义的创作方法也是和对文艺服从政治的庸俗的狭隘的了解有关系的。
    概念化、公式化的倾向就这样地歪曲了文艺和政治的正确关系，因而也就妨碍了文艺和广大群众的真正的结合。
    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，一方面分析了艺术和政治之间可能存在的矛盾，另一方面却要求两者的统一。他说：
    “我们的要求则是政治与艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一……缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。因此我们既反对内容有害的艺术品，也反对只讲内容不讲形式的所谓‘标语口号式’的倾向，我们应该进行文艺问题上的两条战线斗争。”
    目前文艺工作上仍然应当进行这两条战线的斗争，这就是，一方面反对文艺脱离政治的倾向，另一方面也反对概念化、公式化的倾向。
    人民要求既有充实政治内容，又有适当艺术形式的作品，思想性和艺术性统一的作品。这样的作品的形式又必须是大众化的。我们的文艺必须采取群众所喜爱的，便于群众接受的形式。毛泽东同志早在一九三八年党的扩大的六届六中全会的报告里说过：“马克思主义必须和我国的具体特点相结合并通过民族形式才能实现……洋八股必须废止，空洞抽象的调头必须少唱，教条主义必须休息，而代之以新鲜活泼的，为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”。一九四○年他在“新民主主义论”里又说：“中国文化应有自己的形式，这就是民族形式。”
    毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中关于普及和提高的关系作了最正确、最科学的规定，这是毛泽东同志文艺学说中最有创造性的部分之一。文艺既然第一是为工农兵的，普及的文艺就应当放在第一等重要的地位。文艺如果不采取群众所喜爱的，便于群众接受的形式，就不可能普及到群众中去，同时自然也就不可能达到文艺的真正提高。每个民族的文艺都应当有表现自己民族特点的民族形式，何况是像中国这样一个有五亿人口的，有大约四千年的悠久文化历史的伟大民族，它的文艺是必须具备自己的民族特有的形式的。因此，我们的文艺的大众化和民族化，具有特别重大的意义。十年以来，我们遵循了毛泽东同志的关于民族形式的指示，开始认真地研究人民的语言，研究民间文艺，就在这个研究工作的基础上，我们开始创造出了一些真正具有“中国作风和中国气派”的作品，这些作品受到了广大工农群众的热烈欢迎。
    在形式问题上，语言是有头等重要意义的。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中关于“大众化”作了最正确最科学的定义：大众化就是“我们的文艺工作者自己的思想情绪应和工农兵大众的思想情绪打成一片。”接着他又指出：“要打成一片，应从学习群众的言语开始”。毛泽东同志在“反对党八股”的有名讲演中特别说明了学习人民语言的重要。他对那些“洋八股、洋教条”的先生们，那些口讲大众化而实是小众化的人，那些写起文章来，句法有长到四、五十字一句的，其中堆满了鲁迅所说的“谁也看不懂的形容词之类”的作家们给与了多么锋利的无情的批评呵！“洋八股，洋教条”的恶劣倾向在目前文艺工作上还是严重存在的，其主要表现是盲目地崇拜西洋资产阶级艺术，轻视自己民族的艺术传统，轻视民间文艺。这种“洋八股，洋教条”的倾向又是常常和上面所说的“概念化、公式化”的倾向结合的，这就使得我们的许多作品既内容空虚，又语言无味，给我们的艺术带来了最破坏、最有害的结果。另外则有些文艺作家在自己的创作中不适当地任意地采用方言、土语，对人民语言不做加工和提炼的工作，在语言上不下苦工，有些通俗化的文艺作家满足于沿用封建旧文艺中的陈词滥调，而不去努力汲取新鲜活泼的人民语言，也是错误的。我们必须强调提出为保护我们民族语言的纯洁、健康而斗争，文艺家应当站在这个斗争的前列，他们的作品中的语言应当成为国民语言的模范。
    我们民族的文学艺术遗产是极端丰富的。毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”中，关于我们的文化遗产的丰富以及如何整理、继承并批判地发展这些遗产的问题，作了重要的指示。中国民族艺术的遗产和传统，很多至今还活在广大人民中间，它还有极大的强烈的生命力，人民又不断地以自己的新的创作去补充和丰富它们；其中，地方戏曲和民歌，特别值得我们的重视。我们的工人、农民及其它劳动人民喜爱它们。他们之所以喜爱这些艺术，并不只是因为这些形式为他们所熟习，而且也因为在这些人民的艺术创作中常常突破了封建统治思想的束缚而曲折地表现出了人民的思想、情感和愿望。中国的封建阶级，资产阶级，由于它们阶级的限制，都没有能够充分地正确地来运用和发展这些民间艺术；相反地，把它们歪曲和庸俗化，排斥和轻视它们。因此，这些丰富的民间艺术，就长期地处在被轻视的，被糟踏的，因而得不到发展的可怜的地位。我们必须认真地有计划地来搜集、整理和研究这些广泛地散在民间的艺术遗产和民间艺人的创作，并在新的基础上把它们加以改造和提高。因此，我们必须反对轻视民族艺术传统的错误倾向，反对对待艺术遗产的粗暴态度；同时也要反对不肯革新、不求进步的保守主义的倾向。
    毛泽东同志在关于普及和提高的关系问题上，特别指出了文艺专门家和做普及工作的同志之间建立正确关系的必要。他再三叫我们重视工农兵的萌芽状态的文艺，重视群众的墙报，军队和农村中的小剧团，群众的歌唱。当时因为我们还处在农村革命根据地，所以毛泽东同志主要地讲了军队和农村。现在工厂的工人群众文艺有了迅速的蓬勃的发展，应引起我们特别的重视。一切真正愿意为工农兵服务的文艺家都应当注意工人的文艺，在城市群众文艺工作上，更应当坚决地实行第一为工人服务的原则。
    今天纪念毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表的十周年，我们文艺工作者应当：
    继续改造思想，继续对文艺上资产阶级、小资产阶级的错误思想进行批判。
    克服文艺创作上的概念化、公式化的倾向，为掌握无产阶级现实主义的方法而斗争。
    克服文艺上的盲目崇拜西方资产阶级文化的“洋八股、洋教条”的倾向，为进一步发展文艺上的民族形式而斗争。
    让我们所有文艺工作者团结起来，密切地联系群众，刻苦地钻研业务，继续为毛泽东同志所指示的文艺方向而奋斗罢！
