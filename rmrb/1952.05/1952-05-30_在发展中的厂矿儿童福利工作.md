In developing child welfare work in factories and mines
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Women Workers Department

Since liberation, child welfare work in factories and mines has greatly developed due to the concern of the People's Government and the trade unions, the efforts of childcare workers, and the assistance of the Democratic Women's Federation. According to incomplete statistics from 26 provinces and cities at the end of 1951, there were 641 nurseries and breastfeeding rooms in public and private factories and mines, caring for 20,633 children. Among them, the number of factory nurseries and children cared for in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan increased fivefold compared to before liberation. In the Northeast region, there were no factory nurseries at all before liberation, but by August 1951, 118 had been established, caring for 2,733 children.

In the relatively standardized nurseries and kindergartens of larger factories and mines, children can eat a certain amount of nutritious food every day, such as pork liver porridge, tomato porridge, chicken noodle soup, and fruit. Children who are not in good health or who cannot get enough breast milk can also receive supplementary items such as milk powder, cod liver oil, and calcium tablets. Therefore, the children's weight generally increases month by month. For example, the child of Shang Miaoying, a female worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, was born with congenital deficiencies and weighed only four and a half pounds at birth, but from the end of October 1950, when she was sent to the nursery, to April 1951, she grew to 14 pounds.

In the past year, female workers with children have also actively participated in patriotic labor competitions, and they urgently request solutions to the problem of taking care of their children. To meet their demands, factories and mines in various places have begun to establish various forms of childcare organizations such as breastfeeding rooms, temporary nurseries, childcare stations, and mutual aid labor exchange groups for family members. For example, in the Shanghai factory area, workers' families and housewives were organized to establish childcare stations to serve female workers; female workers in the military uniform processing factory in Tiexi District, Shenyang, jointly hired three nannies to establish a temporary nursery to take care of 21 children; several small factories in Wuhan City mobilized workers' families to establish a childcare room; the workshops of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 16 also organized childcare stations so that mothers working the night shift could sleep peacefully during the day. According to incomplete statistics from several major cities in November 1951, 117 factory and mine breastfeeding rooms had been established, which solved many difficulties for mothers.

In order to protect the health of infants and mothers, larger factories and mines in Shanghai, Tianjin, the Northeast, and other places have established maternal and child health stations dedicated to serving female workers and their families, and to promoting new methods of childbirth and other maternal and child health practices. Now, most female workers and their families in larger factories and mines have adopted new methods of childbirth, and the infant mortality rate has been greatly reduced. For example, in the Fushun mining area of ​​Northeast China, the infant mortality rate has dropped from 39.4% to 4.6%; after Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 7 held an exhibition on "New and Old Childbirth Methods" last April, the rate of using new methods of childbirth increased from 69% to 92% by August. Zhang Xiuying, a female worker at Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 6, said: "When I gave birth to children in the past, I asked an old woman to deliver them, and all three of them died. Now Chairman Mao sends doctors to deliver our babies, and our children are all safe." Many factories have paid attention to protecting pregnant women and reducing their workload. Most factories and mines with more than 100 people have also implemented labor insurance regulations. According to statistics from 38 factories in the Northeast, a total of 71.51 million yuan in maternity subsidies was issued last year, and 3,796 female workers and their families received maternity subsidies. Female workers at Chongqing 610 Textile Factory said excitedly: "In the past, female workers could not ask for leave when giving birth, so some of our children were born in the workshop, some were born in the toilet, and many died. Today, the People's Government sends red cloth to make new clothes for the baby while it is still in the mother's womb, and there are 56 days of maternity leave before and after delivery. Today's government is really our own government!" A family member at the Shijingshan Power Plant said with emotion to her twin children: "Without Chairman Mao, you two would not have survived."

Freed from the burden of their children, mothers' strength has been greatly unleashed. For example, female workers with children at the Shenyang Garment Factory have concentrated all their energy on production after being freed from the burden of their children, and some mothers have exceeded their production quotas by as much as two times. When Tianjin Cotton Mill No. 3 conducted a labor competition in 1951, 43 mothers won awards. For example, Shi Baorong, a female worker in the Weaving Department, participated in production with peace of mind because her children were taken care of. She completed 3.6 spindles when the administrative leadership originally planned for 2.8 spindles; later, when the plan was raised to 3 spindles, she completed 4 spindles. Now, she has been elected as a "Kovalev" worker. Shu Meiruo, a female worker at Jinan Renfeng Yarn Factory, increased from reeling about 30 spindles a day to about 50 spindles.

In the past three years, although the child welfare work in factories and mines in New China has achieved preliminary results, it is still far from meeting actual needs. In order to solve the practical difficulties of female workers more widely, the child welfare work leading departments in factories and mines in various places need to further rely on the strength of the masses, adopt revolutionary methods, expand breastfeeding rooms, organize temporary childcare stations and other childcare organizations; strengthen the work of medical clinics, conduct widespread maternal and child health publicity and education among female workers, launch a clean and hygienic movement, and protect the health of children. Democratic Women's Federations and relevant leading departments in various places should continue to vigorously assist trade union organizations and jointly do a good job in child welfare work in factories and mines, so that female workers with children can participate in the increased production and frugality campaign with peace of mind.

    在发展中的厂矿儿童福利工作
    中华全国总工会女工部
    解放以来，工厂矿山的儿童福利工作，由于人民政府和工会的关心、保育工作者们的努力，以及民主妇女联合会的协助，有了很大的发展。仅据二十六个省、市在一九五一年底的不完全统计，公私营厂矿托儿所、哺乳室就有六百四十一处，受托儿童达二万零六百三十三名。其中上海、天津、武汉三市的工厂托儿所和受托儿童就比解放前增加了五倍。东北地区在解放前根本没有工厂托儿所，但到一九五一年八月已建立了一百一十八处，受托儿童达二千七百三十三名。
    在较大厂矿的比较正规化的托儿所和幼儿园里，孩子们每天都能吃到一定量的营养食品了，如猪肝粥、番茄粥、鸡子面、水果等。身体不好和吃不到足够母奶的孩子，还能得到奶粉、鱼肝油、钙片等补助品。所以，孩子们的体重，一般都在逐月增加。如上海国营棉纺第四厂女工尚妙英的孩子，先天不足，出生时体重不过四磅半，但从一九五○年十月底送进托儿所，到一九五一年四月就长到十四磅。
    最近一年来，有孩子的女工也都积极参加了爱国主义劳动竞赛，她们迫切要求解决带孩子的问题。为了满足她们的要求，各地的厂矿开始建立起哺乳室、临时托儿所、托儿站、家属互助变工组等多种多样的托儿组织。如上海工厂区把工人家属和家庭妇女组织起来，成立托儿站，为女工服务；沈阳铁西区军服加工厂女工，合请了三个褓姆，成立临时托儿所，照顾二十一个孩子；武汉市几个小型工厂，动员工人家属，成立了一个托儿间；上海国营棉纺第十六厂的工房，也曾组织过托儿站，使作夜班的妈妈能在白天安静地睡觉。据一九五一年十一月几个大城市的不完全统计，厂矿哺乳室已建立了一百一十七处，这给妈妈们解决了很多的困难。
    为了保护婴儿和母亲的身体健康，上海、天津、东北等地的较大的厂矿都设立了妇幼保健站，专为女工和职工家属服务，并进行新法接生等妇幼卫生的宣传。现在较大厂矿中的多数女工和工人家属都采用了新法接生，婴儿的死亡率已大大降低。如东北抚顺工矿区，婴儿的死亡率已由百分之三十九·四降到百分之四·六；上海国营棉纺第七厂自去年四月开过“新旧接生法”展览会以后，到八月份，采用新法接生的由百分之六十九提高到百分之九十二。上海国营棉纺第六厂女工张秀英说：“以前我生孩子时叫老娘接生，生了三个都死了。现在毛主席派医生给我们接生，我们的孩子都很平安。”许多工厂都注意了对孕妇的保护，减轻了孕妇的工作。百人以上的厂矿也大都实行了劳动保险条例。据东北三十八个工厂的统计：去年共发出生育补助费七千一百五十一万元，有三千七百九十六名女工和职工家属领到了生育补助费。重庆市六一○纺织厂的女工们兴奋地说：“过去女工生孩子不能请假，因此我们的孩子有的生在车间里，有的生在厕所里，死的不知有多少。今天呢，孩子还在娘肚里，人民政府就发红布给孩子作新衣，产前产后还有五十六天休假。今天的政府真是我们自己的政府！”石景山发电厂的一个家属对着孪生的两个孩子感动地说：“没有毛主席，你俩都活不成了。”
    由于摆脱了孩子的牵累，母亲们的力量是大大地发挥出来了。如沈阳被服厂有孩子的女工们摆脱了孩子的牵累后，都把所有的精力集中在生产上，有的母亲超过生产定额达两倍。天津棉纺三厂在一九五一年进行劳动竞赛时，四十三个母亲得了奖。如引通部女工施宝荣，由于自己的孩子得到了照顾，安心地参加了生产。行政领导方面原计划的二·八轴，她完成了三·六轴；后来计划提高到三轴，她完成了四轴。现在，她已被推选为“郭瓦廖夫”工作者。济南仁丰纱厂女工舒美茹，由每天摇纱三十车左右，增加到五十车左右。
    三年来，新中国的工矿儿童福利工作，虽然已取得了初步的成绩，但距离实际需要是很远的。为了更广泛地解决女工们的实际困难，各地厂矿的儿童福利工作领导部门需要进一步依靠群众的力量，采取革命的办法，扩大哺乳室、组织临时托儿站等托儿组织；加强医务室工作，在女工中普遍地进行妇幼卫生宣传教育，开展清洁卫生运动，保护儿童的身体健康。各地民主妇女联合会以及有关领导部门应继续大力协助工会组织，共同把厂矿儿童福利工作搞好，使有孩子的女工能安心地参加增产节约运动。
