Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," held a regional symposium on literature and art from May 9th to 14th. Attendees included representatives from the five provinces and two cities of North China, and twenty-three cadres from organs such as the Literary and Art Department of the North China Bureau Propaganda Department and the Cultural and Educational Bureau of the North China Administrative Council. During the meeting, representatives from various regions reported on the progress of rectification movements in literary and art circles. With the exception of Tianjin, where the rectification will begin later on May 23rd, the rectification movements in literary and art circles in the North China region have concluded in Beijing and Shanxi and are nearing completion in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Chahar.

In units where the rectification in literary and art circles has concluded or is nearing conclusion, some literary and art cadres have already gone to factories and the countryside, while others are preparing to go to factories and the countryside, in order to continue immersing themselves in life and remoulding themselves. In order to effectively consolidate the achievements of the rectification in literature and art, further improve the political thought and artistic level of literary and art work, persist in implementing Chairman Mao's literary and art line, and strengthen the organization of creative work to welcome and cooperate with the economic construction upsurge in the North China region, the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles put forward several requirements to literary and art workers throughout the region at the meeting: 1. After the conclusion of the rectification in literary and art circles, it is still necessary to continue implementing the study of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and to combine this study with the study of the two brilliant philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." This study should be carried out consciously, in conjunction with one's own practice, and persistently over the long term; 2. It is required that after the conclusion of the rectification in literary and art circles, the federations of literary and art circles in various provinces and cities immediately organize writers to go to factories and the countryside in an organized and planned manner, and it is required that every literary and art worker wholeheartedly immerse themselves in life, remould themselves, and engage in creative work; 3. In view of the weak and dispersed nature of the creative forces in the North China region, preparations are being made to organize a North China core creative group, under the principle of remaining in their original locations, to select writers with a certain level of creative ability, determine a list, unify plans, and complete creative tasks on a regular basis.

    纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年
    华北文联筹委会举行全区文艺座谈会
    【新华社二十二日讯】华北文学艺术界联合会筹委会为纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的发表十周年，特于五月九日至十四日，举行全区文艺座谈会，出席会议者有华北五省二市代表、华北局宣传部文艺处，华北行政委员会文教局等机关干部二十三人。会中各地代表汇报了文艺界整风进展的情况。华北区文艺界整风除天津进行较晚定于五月二十三日开始外，北京、山西已经结束，河北、平原、察哈尔已接近结束。
    在文艺界整风已经结束或将要结束的单位，文艺工作干部有的已经下厂下乡，有的正准备下厂下乡，以继续深入生活改造自己。为了切实做到巩固文艺整风的成果，进一步提高文艺工作的政治思想和艺术的水平，坚持贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，加强创作的组织，以迎接配合华北区的经济建设高潮，华北文联筹委会在会上向全区文艺工作者提出了几项要求：一、在文艺界整风结束之后，仍要继续贯彻毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的学习，并结合学习“实践论”、“矛盾论”两篇辉煌的哲学论著。这种学习应当在自觉的基础上，结合自己的实践，长期的坚持贯彻；二、要求各省市文联在文艺界整风结束之后，立即有组织有计划地组织作家下厂下乡，并要求每个文艺工作者全心全意深入生活改造自己，进行创作；三、根据华北区创作力量薄弱而分散的特点，准备组织华北基干创作组，在原地不动的原则下，选择有一定创作水平的作家，确定名单，统一计划，定期完成创作任务。
