    Suihua Locomotive Depot Turret Lathe Group
    After Implementing Advanced Operating Methods, Workers Are No Longer "Waiting for Work" but "Work Waiting for People"

    Editor: In the Suihua Locomotive Depot turret lathe group, before the implementation of the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method, the work was always unfinished, which prolonged the locomotive's stay in the depot and affected other tasks. Workers in the repair group complained, "The turret lathe group can't complete its tasks, which is delaying things." The turret lathe group workers were full of resentment. After the foreman returned from studying the multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method at the Shenyang Locomotive Depot, he immediately organized everyone to learn it. In February, they began preparing, improving 24 tools, including small knives, large knives, and fork-shaped knives. When the conditions were right, they started working. They fired the first shot. Worker Sun Guozhong's turning of the "new-style drain valve" was reduced from 55 minutes to 11 minutes, increasing efficiency by four times. This greatly increased the workers' determination to delve into things. Excellent results followed: Worker Han Guozhi's turning of the "packing gland" was reduced from 12 minutes to 2 minutes; the turning of the "oil pipe joint" was reduced from 13 minutes to 2 minutes, increasing efficiency by five to five and a half times. Therefore, they shortened the locomotive's stay in the depot, completed production tasks ahead of schedule, and eliminated the phenomenon of being too busy. Now, the situation in the turret lathe group is "people waiting for work," not the past "work waiting for people." The workers know the benefits of promoting advanced experiences and are fully promoting them to welcome the upcoming increase production and practice economy campaign.

    绥化机务段镟盘组
    工人推行先进操作法后，不是“活等人”而是“人等活”了
    编辑同志：绥化机务段镟盘组工人，在推行多刀多刃切削法前，活儿总是做不完，延长了机车在库停留时间，也影响了其他工作。检修组工人反映说：“镟盘组完不成任务，耽误事。”镟盘组工人憋了一肚子闷气。工长从沈阳机务段学习多刀多刃切削法回来后，即组织大家学习。二月份，他们开始准备工作，改进小刀、大刀、叉型刀等工具二十四件。条件成熟了，他们就动工。他们打响了第一炮。工人孙国仲镟“新式排水阀”，从过去的五十五分钟减到十一分钟，提高效率四倍。这大大提高了工人的钻研的决心。优胜成绩随着到来：工人韩国志镟
    “盘根帽”，从过去用十二分钟，缩减到二分钟；镟“油管接头”，从十三分钟缩减到二分钟，提高效率五倍到五倍半。因此，他们缩短了机车在库停留时间，提前完成了生产任务，也消灭了忙不过来的现象。现在，镟盘组的情况是“人等活”，不是过去的“活等人”了。工人们知道了推广先进经验的好处，正在全面推广，以迎接即将到来的增产节约运动。　董恩厚　张万金
