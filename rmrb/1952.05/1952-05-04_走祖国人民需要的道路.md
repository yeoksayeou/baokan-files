Taking the Road Needed by the Motherland's People
Jin Feng

"Taking the road of the bourgeoisie or taking the road of the proletariat," student Yang Jinguang felt he had to decide this question.

Yang Jinguang's past road was like this: he was the son of a bankrupt shoe shop owner in Tianjin, a student at the famous bourgeois school Yaohua Middle School, a "standard child" of a bourgeois family and school—good at studying, good at playing ball, and not interested in politics. When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement broke out, his classmates responded enthusiastically to the call of the motherland and joined military cadre schools, but he "calmly" read books and did exercises, wholeheartedly preparing for college. He also knew about some of the atrocities of the American army in Korea, but he always felt that American technology was good. In 1951, he was admitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Yenching University.

His life path had been arranged for him long ago by his family: graduate from university, go to the United States or Japan to study technology as much as possible, and become an engineer in the future. If possible, also be a capitalist. Then, gardens, foreign houses, and cars. He had thought about these more than once. This is what American movies and magazines told him.

When the "Three-Anti" movement began, he felt that this movement had little to do with him. Taking advantage of the school's suspension of classes, he went home for a month. When he returned to school in mid-March, the school had undergone earth-shaking changes. An American professor he had always admired turned out to be an imperialist element, using the banner of "religious freedom" and "academic freedom" to collect intelligence for American imperialism. All of this initially surprised him and made him feel pain. He saw in the exhibition the reports of imperialist elements to the United States: "I have made the homework very heavy, so heavy that even the smartest students are overwhelmed; the students are very hardworking and quiet, and their minds have no other activities." He suddenly thought of himself, wasn't he one of these students?

Reality required him to make a determination to recognize himself and criticize himself. But he couldn't yet! The past life, the dying life, was still tightly dragging him back! He was looking for reasons to "defend" himself! Perhaps, simply studying technology without studying politics could also serve the people?

While he was struggling with himself, one day, several volunteer army comrades came to Yenching University to visit the exhibition. They saw the many "instructions" given to Yenching University by American imperialists before and after liberation, and saw that certain imperialist lackeys of Yenching University were preparing to send to the United States a lot of economic, cultural, and even military strategic intelligence about the new China (including many national defense secrets), they were extremely angry. They asked the students in the exhibition room: "Are we shedding our heads and blood on the front lines to protect these lackeys?"

Seeing the stern gaze of the volunteer army comrades, Yang Jinguang shuddered. At this time, he also heard the news of the American aggressors conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The science and technology of American imperialism turned out to be used to do these inhuman and despicable things! Reality suddenly awakened him. He began to feel that there were only two roads in front of him: one was to ignore politics and study technology to the death, resulting in being unable to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and embarking on the road of reaction: being grateful for the "grace" of American imperialism, being a slave of American imperialism, and a traitor to the motherland; the other road was to care about politics, learn skills well, stand on the position of the proletariat, and serve the motherland and the people.

The sense of justice of young people made him determined to take the road needed by the motherland's people.

Taking the road of the proletariat and being a "capitalist兼engineer" are incompatible. He spurned the exploitative idea of sitting in cars, living in gardens, and foreign houses without labor, and strictly criticized the influence of his bourgeois family and the bourgeois education he received.

Putting down these ideological burdens, he became an active member of the school in continuing ideological struggle and the "Three-Anti" struggle. He carefully listened to reports at various meetings, read progressive books, boldly reported his ideological transformation process, talked to students who were in distress about ideological problems, and helped students with his own experiences. He was very busy, but extraordinarily happy. He seemed to be opening his eyes for the first time, seeing so many beautiful things and noble figures in the world—like Pavel Korchagin, Julius Fucik, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, and Liu Hulan. He began to know that people can fight tirelessly for a great ideal and create real miracles. For this ideal, they can also bravely die, planting beautiful seeds on the earth, and thus gaining eternal life! He regretted that the past years were wasted on petty and boring fantasies. In the past, he was also "nervous," "nervous" about preparing for exams and going to college, but what followed the nervousness was emptiness, gloom, and a heart like a stagnant pool, with only despicable hedonism. What else could he hope for or do? But now, it was completely different. Now life is like a tumbling river, stirring up and swirling many new things every day, surging forward towards a beautiful goal—from new democracy to socialism! He began to read the newspaper carefully. Every new construction project in the motherland, the new construction of the Huai River, the creation of advanced technology in industrial production, the increase in agricultural yield per unit area, and the combat deeds of the volunteer army, all inspired him. He felt that new emotions were constantly stirring and churning in his chest, making him feel excited. He also felt that the relationship between people had changed. In the past, although he had a few small circles of friends, being together was only about mutually "forgiving," mutually "indulging," and mutually "infecting" sentimental and decadent emotions; they were also wary of each other, afraid of hurting each other's feelings. Other than that, he felt that there was mutual suspicion, jealousy, coldness, estrangement, and contempt among the students. He often felt lonely and lonely. But now, he saw that his classmates, especially the Party and League members, were so sincerely helping him and caring for him, treating his troubles as everyone's troubles. Seeing him make a little progress, they were happy for him. He thought: Had his older brothers and sisters ever treated him like this? No, his older brothers and sisters only told him to study hard. What about his parents? They only told him to climb up, ultimately for the sake of "raising children to guard against old age"! This is how the relationship between people in the old society was, and could only be! "Comrades," only these two words—comrades who are fighting for the same ideal—can treat him so selflessly, so strictly and so lovingly. Originally, he thought that abandoning the bourgeois road was a kind of "sacrifice"; now, he saw that what he had lost was just a pile of garbage, and what he had already gained and was about to gain was a happy life of struggle and labor filled with noble ideals.

He began to seriously respond to the call of the Party and the government. In the past, although he said verbally that labor creates the world, he really felt in his heart that labor was a bitter thing. But in this anti-bacteriological warfare health and epidemic prevention campaign at the school, he actively dredged the silt in the campus.

This is just the beginning. It is necessary to carry out a long-term struggle against bourgeois ideology. Therefore, on his bedside, he posted the famous quote from the author of "How the Steel Was Tempered," Nikolai Ostrovsky: Living for the family is the selfishness of animals; living for oneself is simply despicable! Next to it, he posted his patriotic pact: guarantee to eliminate bourgeois hedonistic thoughts, the concept of fame and position, and the purely technical viewpoint, work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, strive to be a glorious member of the Youth League, and be a good student of Mao Zedong. He hopes that he will constantly overcome his weaknesses and become an outstanding construction talent of the new China.

### 走祖国人民需要的道路

    走祖国人民需要的道路  金凤
    “走资产阶级的道路还是走无产阶级的道路”，青年学生杨津光觉得自己必须决定这一个问题。
    杨津光过去的道路是这样走过来的：他是天津一家倒闭了的鞋铺老板的儿子，著名的资产阶级学校耀华中学的学生，资产阶级家庭和学校的“标准子弟”——书念得好，球玩得好，对政治不感兴趣。抗美援朝运动爆发，同学们响应祖国的号召，热情地参加军事干部学校，他却“冷静”地看书、作习题，一心一意准备考大学。他也知道一些美军在朝鲜的暴行，但他总觉得美国的技术还是好的。一九五一年，他考进了燕京大学机械系。
    他的人生道路是家庭早就为他安排好的：大学毕业，尽可能到美国或日本留学，专学技术，将来当工程师。可能的话，兼资本家。然后，花园、洋房和汽车。这些，都在他头脑里想过不止一次。这是美国的电影和杂志告诉他的。
    “三反”运动开始，他认为这运动和自己关系不大。趁学校停课，他回家住了一个月。三月中回到学校来，学校起了翻天覆地的变化。他一向所佩服的一个美国教授，原来是个帝国主义分子，他打着“宗教自由”、“学术自由”的招牌，做着为美帝国主义收集情报的勾当。这一切，最初是使他惊异、也使他感到痛苦的。他看到展览会中陈列的帝国主义分子给美国的报告：“我把功课加得很重，重到一个最聪明的学生也忙不过来的程度；学生们很用功、安静，头脑没有旁的活动。”他一下子想到自己，不正是这些学生中的一个吗？
    现实需要他下决心来认识自己、批判自己。但是他还不能！过去的生活、正在死亡的生活，还在紧紧地拖着他！他寻找着“辩护”的理由！也许，单纯学技术，不学政治，也是可以为人民服务的吧？
    在他这样自我斗争着的时候，有一天，几个志愿军同志来到燕京大学参观展览会。他们看到美国帝国主义者在解放前后给燕京大学的许多“指示”，看到燕京大学的某些帝国主义的奴才准备寄到美国去的新中国的许多经济、文化以至军事战略情报（其中有许多国防秘密），他们气愤极了。他们问展览室内的同学：“难道我们在前方抛头颅、流热血，是为了保卫这些奴才？”
    看到志愿军同志严峻的眼光，杨津光悚然了。在这时候，他又听到了美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的消息。美帝国主义的科学技术，原来是用来做这些无人性的下贱事情的！现实使他猛然清醒起来。他开始感到摆在他面前的只有两条路：一条是不问政治、死学技术，结果敌我不分，走上反动的道路：感激美帝国主义的“恩典”，做美帝国主义的奴才，祖国的叛徒；另一条道路是关心政治，学好本领，站在无产阶级的立场，为祖国、为人民服务。
    青年人的正义感，使他下决心走祖国人民需要的道路。
    走无产阶级的道路和当“资本家兼工程师”是不能相容的。他唾弃了不劳动而坐汽车、住花园、洋房的剥削者思想，严格批判了他的资产阶级家庭和自己所受资产阶级教育的影响。
    放下这些思想包袱，他成为学校中继续进行思想斗争、“三反”斗争的积极分子。他用心倾听各种会议的报告，阅读进步书籍，大胆报告自己的思想转变过程，找正在苦恼的同学谈思想问题，用自己的体会帮助同学。他很忙，但是出奇地愉快。他自己好像第一次睁开眼睛，看到世界上有这样多美好的事情和高尚的人物——像保尔·柯察金、伏契克、丹娘和刘胡兰。他开始知道了人们为一个伟大的理想，可以不倦地斗争，创造真正的奇迹。为了这个理想，也可以勇敢地去死，把美丽的种子种在大地上，因而获得永生！他后悔过去的岁月浪费在卑琐无聊的幻想里。过去他也“紧张”，“紧张”着预备考试、升大学，但紧张之后随着来的是空虚，灰黯，心像一泓死水，只有可卑的及时行乐而已，还能希望什么，作什么呢？但是现在，完全不同了，现在的生活像一条翻滚的河流，每天激荡着、回旋着许多新的事物，浩浩荡荡地奔流，向着美丽的目标——从新民主主义到社会主义！他开始细心阅读报纸。祖国的每一项新的建设，淮河的新的施工，工业生产中先进技术的创造，农业单位面积产量的提高，志愿军的战斗事迹，每一件都鼓舞着他。他觉得胸中不住地有新的感情在激动，翻腾，使他觉得兴致勃勃。他又觉得，人和人之间的关系也变了。过去，他虽然有几个小圈子朋友，但是在一起也不过是互相
    “原谅”，互相“纵容”，互相“传染”感伤的颓废的情绪；又彼此提心吊胆，生怕刺伤了对方的感情。除此以外，他就觉得同学间彼此猜疑、妒忌、冷淡、隔膜和看不起。他常常感到孤独和寂寞。但是现在，他看到同学们特别是党团员是这样真心诚意地帮助他、体贴他，把他的苦恼当成大家的苦恼。看到他有一点进步，就为他高兴。他想：自己的哥哥姊姊这样对待过他吗？没有，哥哥姊姊只叫他死读书。父母呢？他们也只是叫他向上爬，归根到底还是为了“养儿防老”！旧社会人与人的关系就是这样，也只能是这样呵！“同志”，只有这两个字——为了同一理想奋斗的同志，才能这样无私地来对待他，这样严格又这样友爱。原来，他以为自己丢弃了资产阶级的道路是一种“牺牲”；现在，他看到失去的不过是一堆垃圾，而已经得到的和将要得到的是充满着高尚理想的斗争、劳动的幸福生活。
    他开始认真地响应党和政府的号召。在过去，他虽然口头上说劳动创造世界，心里委实觉得劳动是件苦事。但在这次学校反对细菌战的卫生防疫运动中，他积极挖掘校园的淤泥。
    这不过是开始。对于资产阶级思想是需要进行长期斗争的。因此，在他的床头，他贴着“钢铁是怎样炼成的”作者奥斯托洛夫斯基的名句：为家庭而活着，是动物的自私；为自己而活着，则简直是卑鄙！在旁边，贴着他的爱国公约：保证肃清资产阶级的享乐思想、名位观念和单纯技术观点，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，争取作一个光荣的青年团员，作毛泽东的好学生。希望他不断地克服他的弱点，成为新中国优秀的建设人才。
