    The Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huailai County
    Chahar Provincial Cooperative General Office

    I. How did the Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative develop and grow?

    The Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huailai County, Chahar Province, has a total of 2,205 members. These members live in ten villages, accounting for 51% of the total population of these ten villages. The cooperative's capital totals 28.01 million yuan.

    The villages belonging to Xiyulin United Village originally had small cooperatives based on villages. These cooperatives were not well-run and all stopped due to losses. This left a bad impression on the members. When the Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative was established, the original members were not actively involved. During that period, the daily turnover was only 40,000 yuan.

    However, because the cooperative correctly implemented the policy of "serving the members" and "serving production" with the help of the local Party and government leaders and the superior cooperative, it gradually gained the support of the members, and thus gradually overcame various difficulties and grew in organization and business. Labor model Gao Jiangyun (Party branch secretary) mobilized all Party and League members to patiently publicize the benefits of organizing cooperatives to the masses; Gao Suyun (Party member), Gao Hongyun, Fu Yin and others from Gao Jiangyun's mutual aid group voluntarily took out surplus grain and surplus funds of 1.1 million yuan and deposited them in the cooperative without interest; more than a dozen members with large carts actively came to transport goods for the cooperative. This solved the cooperative's problems of insufficient funds and inability to transport goods.

    The cooperative first grasped the important link of selling products for the members and helping them expand reproduction. The masses in Xiyulin Village grow more cash crops. Of the village's more than 5,200 mu of cultivated land, the area planted with peanuts and sunflowers last year accounted for 85% of the total area. Last year, the cooperative sold more than 168,900 jin of sunflower seeds and 400,000 jin of fruit for the members; at the same time, the cooperative supplied the members with various materials they needed, with millet alone amounting to 100,600 jin.

    In order to strengthen the planning of business operations, the Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducted an in-depth investigation of the local production and sales situation in order to organize supply and sales with confidence. In January this year, the cooperative organized its members to go directly to the station to transport the coal they had purchased from the cooperative according to their needs. It only took one day to distribute all 77 tons of coal to the members; this reduced procedures, losses and freight in the supply process, and reduced the cost of supplied goods. For example, at that time, the local market price of coal was 11,000 yuan per 100 jin, while the cooperative's coal was sold for only 7,850 yuan per 100 jin. From July last year to March this year, the total value of goods supplied by the cooperative was 203.47 million yuan, and the total value of goods sold was 356.5 million yuan. In the fourth quarter of last year, the cooperative sold sunflowers, fruits, and dry firewood for the members. In the first quarter of this year, it supplied the members with coal, sesame oil, kerosene, and white flour, reducing intermediate exploitation for the members by a total of 100.43 million yuan.

    The Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative conducts patriotic education for its members at any time, which has improved the ideological awareness of the members. This is one of the important reasons why the cooperative can do its work well. Member Kang Zeng said: "If it weren't for the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we wouldn't have today! We can't forget the well-diggers when we drink water. I hand over the sunflowers and peanuts to the cooperative and sell them to the country, also expressing my patriotic feelings."

    All major affairs of the cooperative are studied by the representative meeting in advance and then implemented. This fully develops the wisdom and initiative of the members. According to the opinions of the members, the cooperative lowered the prices of kerosene, edible salt, cotton, cloth and other goods twice in December last year and February this year. The entire cooperative has only four cadres. Whenever business is busy, many members voluntarily come to the cooperative to help. The cooperative then organizes temporary committees for local product sales, fertilizer supply, etc., to divide the work and cooperate, so that the heavy business is completed quickly and smoothly.

    The directors, supervisors and member representatives of the cooperative regularly conduct propaganda and education work for the members, and established a cooperative propaganda network this year. Last year, when the cooperative promoted DDT, it achieved good results because it combined technical guidance and extensive publicity. Member Fu Jingshan said: "I never believed that these medicines could cure insects, but now I understand that they really work." Some local farmers did not have the habit of applying dried manure in the fields. The cooperative carried out propaganda and education for these farmers, gradually changing this situation and distributing all the purchased dried manure to the masses. The cooperative also used practical examples to educate the members that production and sales should be separated, and overcome their individual farming ideas. Member Gao Bin harvested 3,000 jin of fruit. He only sold 300 jin to the cooperative, and transported the remaining 2,700 jin to Beijing, where he sold them for an average of 600 yuan per jin, totaling 1.62 million yuan. After spending 500,000 yuan, his net income was 1.12 million yuan. The cooperative gave Gao Bin an accounting: If he had sold this batch of fruit to the cooperative, he could have earned a net of 1.83 million yuan. Now he is selling these products himself, working hard back and forth, and selling 210,000 yuan less. This matter effectively overcame the individual farming ideas of the members.

    II. The "Combination Contract" signed by the Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Gao Jiangyun Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Gao Qiyun Mutual Aid Group

    In order to combine the cooperative's business plan with the mutual aid group's production and consumption plan, and to effectively guarantee its realization, the Xiyulin United Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative first signed a "Combination Contract" with the Gao Jiangyun Agricultural Production Cooperative (six households, 29 people) and the Gao Qiyun Mutual Aid Group (seven households, 31 people).

    According to the contract, the cooperative must fully and cheaply supply the mutual aid group with the production and living materials they need, and purchase the members' agricultural and sideline products at reasonable prices. The contract stipulates the sale of 11 kinds of agricultural and sideline products of the members, totaling 87.88 million yuan; the supply of 22 kinds of production and living materials to the members, totaling 49.02 million yuan; the total supply and sales of the above is 136.9 million yuan. The time period is from April 10, 1952 to December 31. The contract makes principled provisions on the specifications, quality, quantity, delivery location and date of the goods. There are four copies of this contract. In addition to the two parties each holding one copy, one copy is also submitted to the superior cooperative and the village production disaster relief and drought prevention committee, so that these contracts can be thoroughly implemented under the leadership and supervision of the superior and relevant authorities.

    These contracts were signed under smooth circumstances. This is because the cooperative already has a foundation for combining with the mutual aid group. Xiyulin Village is a model village in the county. The masses have a high degree of awareness, and mutual aid groups have been established throughout the village. When the cooperative was established, the member groups and the mutual aid groups were not combined, so the cooperative's business and the mutual aid group's production could not be well combined. Later, the mutual aid groups and the member groups were unified, and the entire cooperative was integrated with the mutual aid groups. In real life, members (mutual aid group members) gradually experienced the benefits of combination and the superiority of organization.

    III. Work Experience

    First, rural supply and marketing cooperatives must implement the policy of serving the members and serving production. When implementing this policy, the cooperative closely combined the cooperative's supply and sales business with the mutual aid group's production activities. The cooperative gave the vast number of members visible benefits, thus winning the support of the vast number of members.

    Second, in order to realize the planning of business, supply and marketing cooperatives must unify sales and collective purchases. Investigate and statistically analyze the requirements of the members, and formulate their own business plans and expand supply and sales business according to their requirements. Production, sales and supply are all carried out under careful planning, and supply and marketing cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and agricultural production cooperatives are consolidated and developed.

    怀来县西榆林联村的供销合作社
    察哈尔省合作总社
    一　西榆林联村供销合作社是怎样发展壮大的？
    察哈尔省怀来县西榆林联村供销合作社共有社员二千二百零五人。这些社员分住在十个村庄，占这十个村总人口百分之五十一。该社资金共有两千八百零一万元。
    西榆林联村所属村庄，原来都有以村为单位的小型合作社。这些合作社办得都不够好，都因赔本而停顿了。这就给社员留下了不良的印象。西榆林联村供销合作社成立时，原有的社员都不积极参加。那一期间每天的营业额只有四万元。
    但因该社在当地党、政领导方面和上级社的帮助下，正确地执行了“为社员服务”、“为生产服务”的方针，逐渐得到社员的拥护，所以就逐步地克服了各种困难，在组织上和业务上发展壮大起来。劳动模范高江云（党的支部书记）发动全体党、团员，耐心地向群众宣传组织合作社的好处；高江云互助组组员高素云（党员）、高鸿云、傅印等自动拿出余粮和余款一百一十万元，不要利息，存入该社；十多户有大车的社员，积极地来给合作社运货。这就解决了合作社的资金不足和无力运输的问题。
    该社首先抓住了给社员推销产品的重要环节，帮助社员扩大再生产。西榆林村群众种植经济作物较多，全村五千二百多亩耕地，去年种花生和葵花的耕地面积，达总面积的百分之八十五。去年该社共替社员推销葵花子十六万八千九百多斤，水果四十万斤；与此同时，该社供应了社员需要的各种物资，只小米一项就供应了十万零六千斤。
    为了加强业务经营的计划性，西榆林联村供销合作社对当地产销情况进行了深入的调查，以便有把握地组织供销。今年一月间，该社根据社员的需要，组织社员直接到车站去运他们向合作社购买的煤炭，只用了一天的时间，就把七十七吨煤全部分发到社员手里；这样就减少了供应中的手续、损耗和运费，降低了供应物品的成本。如当时当地的煤炭的市价每百斤为一万一千元，合作社的煤炭售价每百斤只七千八百五十元。自去年七月到今年三月，该社供应的物品，总值两亿零三百四十七万元，推销的物品，总值三亿五千六百五十万元，该社在去年第四季替社员推销葵花、水果、干柴，在今年第一季供应社员煤炭、麻油、煤油、白面，共为社员减除中间剥削一亿零四十三万元。
    西榆林联村供销合作社随时对社员进行爱国主义教育，提高了社员的思想觉悟，这是该社所以能把工作做好的重要原因之一。社员康增说：“要没有毛主席和共产党的领导，可没有今天！吃水不能忘了打井人，我把葵花、花生都交给合作社，卖给国家，也表达我一分爱国的心意。”
    该社的各种重大事务，事前都是经过代表会的研究，然后贯彻执行的。这样就充分地发扬了社员的智慧和积极性。该社根据社员的意见，在去年十二月和今年二月，两次降低了煤油、食盐、棉、布等货物的价格。全社只有四个干部，每当业务工作繁忙时，许多社员就自愿地到合作社来帮忙。该社便组织临时的土产推销、供肥等委员会，分工合作，使繁重的业务都迅速地、顺利地完成了。
    该社的理事、监事和社员代表，经常对社员群众进行宣传教育工作，今年并建立了合作社的宣传网。去年该社推广滴滴涕时，因结合技术指导，展开了广泛的宣传，推广成绩很好。社员傅景山说：“我过去总不相信这些药水能治虫子，现在才了解它真管事了。”当地有些农民没有在农田中施用大粪干的习惯，该社对这些农民进行了宣传教育，逐步地改变了这种状况，把买进的大粪干全部发到了群众手中。该社并通过实际例子，向社员进行了产销应该分工的教育，克服他们的单干思想。社员高彬收获了三千斤果子，他只卖给合作社三百斤，而把剩下的二千七百斤运到北京，每斤平均卖六百元，共卖一百六十二万元，除花费五十万元，净收入一百十二万元。该社给高彬算了一笔账：假若他把这批果子卖给合作社，可净得一百八十三万元。现在他自己推销这批产品，徒劳往返，并且少卖了二十一万元。这件事情，有力地克服了社员的单干思想。
    二　西榆林联村供销合作社和高江云农业生产合作社、高启云互助组订立的“结合合同”
    为了把合作社的经营计划和互助组的生产、消费计划结合起来，并切实保证其实现，西榆林联村供销合作社首先和高江云农业生产合作社（六户、二十九人）、高启云互助组（七户、三十一人），订立了“结合合同”。
    按照合同的规定，该社要充分地廉价地供应互助组需要的生产和生活资料，并以合理的价格，收购社员的农业副业产品。合同规定推销社员农业副业产品共十一种，共值八千七百八十八万元；供应社员生产和生活资料二十二种，共合四千九百零二万元；以上供销总计一亿三千六百九十万元。时间是从一九五二年四月十日至十二月三十一日。在合同中，对货物的规格、质量、数量、交货地点和日期，都作了原则的规定。这种合同共有四份，除当事双方各持一份外，并交上级社和村生产救灾防旱委员会各一份，以便在上级和有关机关的领导、监督下，彻底地实现这些合同。
    这些合同是在顺利的情况下签订的。这是因为该社已经有了和互助组相结合的基础。西榆林村是全县的模范村，群众觉悟较高，全村普遍地建立了互助组。合作社成立时，社员小组和互助组没有结合起来，因此，合作社的业务和互助组的生产也不能很好地结合。后来，互助组和社员小组统一起来，整个合作社就和互助组融合为一了。在实际生活中，社员（互助组员）逐渐体验到结合的好处和组织起来的优越性。
    三　工作中的体验
    第一、农村供销合作社必须贯彻为社员服务、为生产服务的方针。该社在执行这一方针时，把合作社的供销业务和互助组的生产活动密切地结合起来了。合作社给了广大社员以看得见的利益，因此获得广大社员的拥护。
    第二、供销合作社为了实现业务的计划性，必须统一推销，集体购买。调查统计社员的要求，根据他们的要求，制定自己的业务计划，展开供销业务。产销和供应都在周密的计划下进行，供销合作社和互助组、农业生产合作社都得到巩固和发展。
