    Visiting Soviet Trade Union Delegation Representative and Stalin Prize Winner, S. Busyev

    To Chinese workers, the name S. Busyev is not unfamiliar. Now, this heroic figure who created a new world record in high-speed cutting and won the Stalin Prize has come to the capital of New China from distant Moscow.

    S. Busyev said that he was very happy to spend this year's "May Day" with Chinese workers, and he hoped to meet famous Chinese labor models and exchange experiences with each other. Therefore, he brought with him a small, exquisite leather case, filled with various high-speed cutting tools. He said, "If the Chinese worker brothers are happy, I will be very willing to give everyone a practical demonstration."

    S. Busyev is thirty-two years old this year and has been a lathe operator for seventeen years. He is currently a worker at the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow. In 1948, the factory invited two innovators in production to introduce the experience of high-speed cutting. S. Busyev learned these experiences and developed them further, increasing the cutting speed from more than 20 meters per minute to more than 100 meters per minute. Later, he worked with the workshop leaders to study and improve the tools and motors, and further increased the cutting speed to 600 meters per minute.

    In 1951, the factory accepted a batch of orders for the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station. S. Busyev was responsible for cutting a kind of extremely hard parts belonging to this batch of orders. He completed the task that others could only complete in two hours and thirty-five minutes in four minutes. S. Busyev's work in eight hours exceeded his original quota by sixteen times. Thanks to S. Busyev's hard work, he finally broke through the world level of 2,400 meters per minute of cutting speed and created a new world record of 2,650 meters per minute of cutting speed. In 1951, he was gloriously awarded the Stalin Prize. Up to now, S. Busyev has not only completed the 1952 production task ahead of schedule, but also exceeded it by a large margin, and is now advancing in the direction of completing the 1972 task ahead of schedule.

    S. Busyev is not only a creator of the highest production record, but also a most powerful disseminator of advanced experience. He is a lecturer at the Stakhanov School of the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow, responsible for organizing workshop workers to learn high-speed cutting methods, and often goes to various places to promote his experience. Now, 85 percent of the workers in his workshop have learned and adopted his method. At the same time, S. Busyev himself is also studying at the Lathe Tool Technology School. He plans to increase the cutting speed from the current 2,650 meters per minute to 3,000 meters per minute. Regarding this, S. Busyev has no doubt, he said again and again: "I have full confidence and assurance, I will definitely be able to do it!"

    S. Busyev also told reporters that after returning to China, he plans to immediately start writing a book, introducing his working methods and experience in detail. Finally, S. Busyev said: "Due to the rational organization of work, the appropriate arrangement of tools, and the strengthening of speed at every stage of work, I have achieved some results in high-speed cutting, but I am not satisfied. I will continue to work hard and strive to complete the task of 1972 ahead of schedule!" (Chen Ge) (Attached picture)

    访苏联工会代表团代表、斯大林奖金得奖人谢·布苏也夫
    对中国工人来说，谢·布苏也夫这个名字并不生疏。现在，这位创造世界高速切削新纪录，荣获斯大林奖金的英雄人物，已从遥远的莫斯科来到新中国的首都了。
    谢·布苏也夫说：他非常喜欢和中国工人一同度过今年的“五一”节，他更希望能和中国各著名的劳动模范见面，互相交流经验。因此，他随身带来了一只精巧的小皮箱，里面满装着各种各样高速切削的刀具。他说：“如果中国的工人兄弟高兴的话，我将非常愿意给大家作实地表演。”
    谢·布苏也夫今年三十二岁，已经做了十七年的镟工，现在是莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的工人。一九四八年间，工厂约请了两位生产上的革新者，来介绍高速切削的经验。谢·布苏也夫学习了这些经验又加以发挥，把切削速度由每分钟二十多公尺提高到一百多公尺。以后，他又和车间领导上一起研究，改进了工具、马达，进而把切削速度提高到每分钟六百公尺。
    一九五一年，工厂接受了建设古比雪夫水力发电站的一批定货，谢·布苏也夫负责切削属于这批定货的一种性质极硬的零件。他在四分钟之内，就完成了别人两小时三十五分才能完成的任务。谢·布苏也夫在八小时内做的工作，超过他的原定额的十六倍。由于谢·布苏也夫的苦心钻研，最后，他终于突破了切削速度每分钟二千四百公尺的世界水平，而创造了切削速度每分钟二千六百五十公尺的世界新纪录。一九五一年间，他便光荣地获得了斯大林奖金。到现在为止，谢·布苏也夫不仅提前完成了一九五二年度的生产任务。并且超额很多，现在正向提前完成一九七二年的任务的方向前进。
    谢·布苏也夫不仅是一个最高生产纪录的创造者，而且是一个最有力的先进经验的传授者。他是莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂车间斯塔哈诺夫学校的讲授人，负责组织车间工人学习高速切削法，并且经常到各地推广他的经验。现在，他所在的车间已有百分之八十五的工人都学会并采用了他的方法。而同时，谢·布苏也夫自己还到车床工具技术专校学习，他计划把切削速度由现有的每分钟二千六百五十公尺提高到三千公尺。关于这一点，谢·布苏也夫没有丝毫的怀疑，他一遍又一遍地说：“我有充分的信心和把握，我一定能够做到！”
    谢·布苏也夫还告诉记者说：他回国后，准备马上着手写一本书，详细地介绍他的工作方法和经验，最后，谢·布苏也夫说：“由于合理地组织工作、适当地布置工具和在每一个工作阶段上加强速度，我能够在高速切削方面获得了一些成绩，但是我并不满足，我还要继续努力，为提前完成一九七二年的任务而奋斗！”  （陈戈）（附图片）
