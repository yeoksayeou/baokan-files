    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 10th: According to a TASS report: The Soviet people are enthusiastically subscribing to government bonds. The Soviet Ministry of Finance recently announced that the national bonds issued by the Soviet government on the 6th, totaling 30 billion rubles, had reached 35,712,374,000 rubles by the 8th. In view of the fact that the subscription amount has greatly exceeded the original target, the Soviet Ministry of Finance, under the instruction of the Soviet Council of Ministers, ordered all regions to stop promoting the sale of government bonds starting from the 10th.
    The Soviet people's enthusiastic subscription to government bonds vividly illustrates their love and loyalty to their socialist motherland once again. Since the news of the issuance of government bonds was broadcast, people in cities and villages across the Soviet Union have held mass rallies to warmly welcome the issuance. They emphasized the peaceful nature of the bonds and unanimously subscribed enthusiastically. Moscow worker Usov said at a workers' rally at the Uprising Square construction site: Our government is pursuing a policy of continuously improving the people's living standards. We heartily welcome the government's decision to issue new bonds. We know that the funds lent to the state will further increase the happiness of all the Soviet people. Mikhailov, a worker at the Kirov factory in Leningrad, said: The new bonds are our contribution to strengthening the fortress of world peace—the Soviet state. It will promote the further development of the Soviet national economy. To help the country successfully complete the great communist construction plan, miners in the Donets Coal Region and steel workers in the Stalinino Oblast have recently been enthusiastically subscribing to government bonds while also participating in Stakhanovite work shifts.

    苏联人民在三天内认购公债超过定额
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联人民踊跃认购公债。最近苏联财政部发表报告说：苏联政府于六日开始发行的三百亿卢布的国家公债，截至八日止，认购数额已达三百五十七亿一千二百三十七万四千卢布。鉴于认购数额已大大超过原定数字，苏联财政部根据苏联部长会议的指示，命令从十日起各地一律停止推销公债。
    苏联人民认购公债的踊跃，又一次生动地说明了他们对于社会主义祖国的热爱和忠诚。自从发行公债的消息广播后，苏联全国城市和乡村的人民纷纷举行群众大会，热烈欢迎公债的发行。他们强调指出公债的和平性质，并一致踊跃认购。莫斯科工人乌索夫在起义广场建筑工地工人集会上说：我们政府所推行的是不断提高人民生活水平的政策。我们衷心欢迎政府发行新公债的决定。我们知道借给国家的款项将进一步增进全苏联人民的幸福。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂的工人米哈依洛夫说：新公债就是我们对加强世界和平堡垒——苏维埃国家这一事业的贡献。它将促进苏联国民经济进一步的发展。为了帮助国家顺利完成伟大共产主义建设计划，顿尼兹煤区的矿工和斯大林诺州的钢铁工人最近一方面热烈认购公债，一方面又参加了斯塔哈诺夫式工作班。
