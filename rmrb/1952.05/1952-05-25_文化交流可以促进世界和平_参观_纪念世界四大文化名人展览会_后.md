    Cultural Exchange Can Promote World Peace
    ——After Visiting the "Exhibition Commemorating Four World Cultural Celebrities"
    Editor: I recently visited the "Exhibition Commemorating Four World Cultural Celebrities" at the National Beijing Library, and I deeply felt that this exhibition was rich in content, vivid, and educational. The main contents of the exhibition are: Avicenna's "Canon of Medicine," a Ming Dynasty version of more than 10,000 words (i.e., "Huihui Medical Book"); reproductions of Da Vinci's highly artistic works "The Last Supper" and "Mona Lisa"; Hugo's works, such as various Chinese translations of "Les Misérables"; stills from the Chinese performances of Gogol's famous play "The Government Inspector," and Mr. Lu Xun's handwritten translation of "Dead Souls."
    The items displayed at this exhibition illustrate that in the Ming Dynasty, China already had scientific and technological exchanges with Central Asia. This made me deeply appreciate how great and correct Chairman Mao's passage in "On New Democracy" is. That passage is: "China should absorb a great deal of foreign progressive culture as raw material for its own cultural nourishment; this work has not been done enough in the past. This includes not only the current socialist culture and new-democratic culture, but also foreign ancient culture, such as the culture of the Enlightenment era in various capitalist countries. Everything that we can use today should be absorbed." I more deeply realized that mankind has been unswervingly studying cultural science and pursuing truth since ancient times. Good people have always passionately loved culture, freedom, and peace from ancient times to the present. Strengthening cultural exchanges between countries is of great significance to the great unity of the people of the world.

    文化交流可以促进世界和平
    ——参观“纪念世界四大文化名人展览会”后
    编辑同志：我最近在国立北京图书馆参观“纪念世界四大文化名人展览会”以后，深深地感到这个展览会内容丰富、生动和有教育意义。展览的主要内容有：阿维森纳一万多字的著作“医典”的明朝版本（即“回回医书”）；达·芬奇的具有高度艺术价值的作品“最后的晚餐”、“蒙娜丽莎”的复制本；雨果的著作，如“悲惨世界”等各式各样的中译本；果戈理的名剧“巡按”在中国上演的剧照，以及鲁迅先生翻译“死魂灵”的亲笔译稿。
    这个展览会上展览的物品，说明在明朝时，我们中国已经和中亚细亚有科学技术的交流了。这使我深刻地体会到毛主席在“新民主主义论”里所说的一段话是何等伟大和正确。那段话是：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料，这种工作过去做得很不够。这不但是当前的社会主义文化与新民主主义文化，还有外国的古代文化，例如各资本主义国家启蒙时代的文化，凡属我们今天用得着的东西，都应该吸收。”我更深切地体会到：人类在很早以前，就在不折不挠地钻研文化科学，追寻着真理。善良的人们从古到今都是热烈地爱好文化、自由与和平的。各国文化交流的加强，对全世界人民大团结是有着非常重大的意义的。
