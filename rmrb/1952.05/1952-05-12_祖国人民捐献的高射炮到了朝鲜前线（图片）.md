(7) One night at twelve o'clock, the battalion commander notified each company by telephone: "The cannons have arrived again!" The telephone operator of the Third Company dropped the receiver, ran to the top of the bunker, and shouted: "The cannons have arrived, hurry up and pick them up!" As soon as the gunners heard the shout, they immediately got up and ran to the highway.

(8) They held the hand of the person leading the cannons and surrounded the cannons noisily. One touched the muzzle and said, "Good cannon!" Another looked at the cannon wheel and said, "New cannon!" Some said, "Look how good the people of the motherland are to us. They said they would donate cannons, and the cannons have arrived." Someone suggested, "Don't touch them anymore, be careful to damage them!" Liu Si, a gunner who had never touched a new cannon, couldn't help but ask, "These were donated by the people of the motherland, just let me touch it once!"

(9) The new cannons from the motherland headed towards the front. The gunners set up the cannons and started wiping them overnight. Gong Zhongming, a gunner of a new cannon, wiped the cannon and said, "I rely entirely on you to resist America and aid Korea, and you rely on me to resist America and aid Korea; we are new people with new cannons, and we must strive to shoot down more enemy planes to repay the people of the motherland!" His comrades couldn't help but laugh when they heard this.

    （七）一天夜里十二点多钟，营长用电话通知各连说：“炮又来到了！”三连的电话员丢下受话筒跑到掩蔽部顶上高喊：“炮来到了，赶快去接炮啦！”炮手们一听到叫喊，立刻爬起来就往公路上跑去。
    （八）他们一面拉着领炮人的手，一面闹嚷嚷地把炮围了起来。这个摸摸炮口说：“好炮！”那个看看炮轮说：“新炮！”有的说：“你看祖国人民对咱多好，说捐炮，炮就来了。”有人提议说：“不要再摸了，当心弄坏啦！”没有摸过新炮的炮手刘四忍不住要求说：“这是祖国人民捐献的，只让咱摸一下吧！”
    （九）来自祖国的新炮开向阵地了，炮手们把炮安置好了，并连夜擦起炮来，一门新炮的炮手龚中明一边擦着，一边对炮说：“我抗美援朝全靠你，你抗美援朝也靠我；咱们是新人新炮，要争取多打下敌机，好报答祖国人民！”战友们听了都忍不住哈哈大笑起来。
    （完）
