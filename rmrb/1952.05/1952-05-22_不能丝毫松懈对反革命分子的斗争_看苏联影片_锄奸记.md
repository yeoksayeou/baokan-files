    Cannot Slacken the Struggle Against Counter-Revolutionary Elements Even Slightly
    —Watching the Soviet Film "The Exploit of a Scout"
    Liu Enqi

    I finished watching "The Exploit of a Scout" with excitement and admiration. Like other Soviet films with the theme of fighting against spies, such as "The Party Card," "Eternal Secret," and "Flames of Wrath," "The Exploit of a Scout" brilliantly reflects the noble qualities, heroic spirit, and how they overcame the enemy with outstanding and skillful fighting artistry of the Soviet state security personnel. From beginning to end, the film attracts people with its clear patriotic ideology and tense, tortuous story.

    The film unfolds the entire story around the event of Soviet scientist Lyachiev inventing a new weapon and experimenting with it at the front. During the years of the Great Patriotic War, the new type of cannon invented by Soviet engineer Lyachiev fiercely bombarded the German bandits on various fronts, forcing them to flee in disarray. The Hitler bandits were shocked! General Ksharapov (head of the German intelligence headquarters "Russian Department") roared at his lackeys: "Don't be stingy! Mobilize everyone, and get Lyachiev at any cost!" After learning that Lyachiev was preparing to go to the central front to test the cannon himself, the German intelligence agency sent out many secret agents, plotting to capture Lyachiev and take him to Germany, hoping to obtain the secret of this new weapon from him.

    After the Soviet state security personnel learned of this situation, they made careful arrangements. On the one hand, they placed Lyachiev under strict protection to carry out his mission. On the other hand, they set a trap to lure the enemy. Even Carlson, the veteran female agent sent by the German spy agency for the first time, could not escape the sharp eyes of the Soviet security workers. They grasped all the conspiracies of the Nazi bandits. The German agent Petro Nescow caught "Lyachiev" and was very happy, shouting, "Goodbye, dear Russia!" and boarded the plane proudly. But the place where the plane arrived was not Berlin, but Moscow; the plane was German, but the personnel were Soviet; the person who was kidnapped was not Lyachiev himself, but Lyachiev disguised by Sergeyev. German agent Petro Nescow surrendered on his own plane.

    "The Exploit of a Scout" tells people that in their final struggle near death, imperialists and all counter-revolutionary remnants are bound to be extremely hostile to every progress and every achievement of the people's revolutionary cause, and are bound to carry out frantic sabotage. The daughter of a White Russian officer who fled to Germany after the October Revolution, the Tsar's guards, a lawyer from the Tsar's era—a corrupt official who had been imprisoned by the Soviet government, the son of a wealthy peasant who had committed a major crime and escaped from prison, and other dregs discarded by the Soviet people long ago, all ran to the German aggressors, and after training, acted as the henchmen of the German aggressors, counterattacking the Soviet people. This situation is particularly familiar to the victorious Chinese people. In order to sabotage the Chinese people's revolutionary cause, the U.S. imperialists are training Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit gangs in Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong and other places, and are constantly seeking opportunities to sneak into our country to carry out sabotage activities. But these guys will never escape the giant palm of the Chinese people, just as the Nazi agents could not escape the giant palm of the Soviet people!

    The film "The Exploit of a Scout" also tells us: we must maintain a high degree of political vigilance against enemies at home and abroad. As long as there is a slight negligence or intentional or unintentional disclosure of state secrets, it may cause serious losses to the people. In "The Exploit of a Scout," we saw that at the banquet at the front-line airport to welcome the "comfort group," a Soviet air force officer warmly welcomed and grandly entertained all the members of the "comfort group," but refused to answer inquiries about where the artillery positions were, because this was a military secret. But there are also individuals who ignore the seriousness of political struggle and lack due vigilance, feeling that everything is lovely on their own country's land, and that there are no hidden enemies! But the problem arises from here: at the same banquet, an artillery officer revealed Lyachiev's location, which allowed the enemy to take advantage of the situation.

    Stalin praised the Soviet state security personnel in the early days of the founding of the Soviet Union as "the death knell of the bourgeoisie, the guards of the revolution, and the sword of the proletariat." The deeds of the Soviet security personnel shown in the film "The Exploit of a Scout" prove that they are worthy of their glorious title! The tempered Soviet security workers are good at maintaining their political sensitivity at any time in the most complex and acute struggles, skillfully discerning any cunning tricks of the enemy, and giving the enemy a fatal blow; they are good at conducting serious investigations and research in their work, and considering issues comprehensively in order to complete their tasks most perfectly. This is worth learning from us.

    The performance of the film "The Exploit of a Scout" has an unusually profound and realistic educational significance for the people of our country. It tells us that as long as the imperialist aggressive forces in the world have not been eliminated, we must not relax our vigilance and struggle against enemies at home and abroad for a moment!

### 不能丝毫松懈对反革命分子的斗争——看苏联影片“锄奸记”

    不能丝毫松懈对反革命分子的斗争
    ——看苏联影片“锄奸记”
    刘恩启
    我怀着激动和感佩的心情，看完了“锄奸记”。像苏联其他以反奸细斗争为主题的影片如“党证”、“永远的秘密”、“愤怒的火焰”等一样，“锄奸记”出色地反映出苏维埃国家保卫工作人员的高贵品质、英雄气概以及他们怎样以卓越的纯熟的斗争艺术战胜了敌人。影片自始至终都以鲜明的爱国主义思想和紧张曲折的故事吸引着人们。
    影片围绕着苏联科学家廖其耶夫发明新式武器并到前线实验的事件，展开了整个故事。在伟大卫国战争的年代，苏联工程师廖其耶夫发明的新式大炮，在各个战线上猛烈地轰击着德寇，迫使德寇狼狈溃逃。希特勒匪徒们震惊了！克沙达普将军（德寇特务大本营“俄国科”的负责人）暴跳如雷地对他的喽啰们吼叫着：“不要心疼什么！把所有的人都动起来，花什么代价也要把廖其耶夫弄到手！”在探得了廖其耶夫准备亲自到中央战线去试验大炮的消息后，德寇特务机关派出了许多特务分子，阴谋把廖其耶夫俘掳到德国去，想从他得到这种新式武器的秘密。
    苏联国家保卫机关的工作人员知道了这些情况之后，就做了周密的布置，一方面使廖其耶夫处在严密的保护下执行他的任务，另一方面设下了诱敌的圈套，连德寇间谍机关首次派来的老牌女特务卡尔逊，也没有逃过苏联保卫工作者的锐眼。他们掌握了纳粹匪徒的全部阴谋诡计。德国特务捉到了“廖其耶夫”，高兴得很，狂叫了一声“再见吧，亲爱的俄国！”骄傲地上了飞机。可是飞机抵达的地方不是柏林，而是莫斯科；飞机是德国的，但人员却是苏联的；被绑劫的不是廖其耶夫本人，而是由谢尔节耶夫化装的廖其耶夫。德国特务别特罗聂斯库在他们自己的飞机上俯首就擒了。
    “锄奸记”告诉人们：帝国主义者和一切反革命残余势力，在自己临近死亡的最后挣扎中，必然极端仇视人民革命事业的每一个进展，每一个成就，必然要进行疯狂的破坏。十月革命后逃亡到德国的白党军官的女儿，沙皇的近卫军，沙皇时代的律师——曾被苏联政府押过的贪污分子，犯过大罪被判处死刑又从监狱里逃出来的富农的儿子等早被苏联人民抛弃了的渣滓，都跑到德国侵略者那里去，经过训练，充当德国侵略者的鹰犬，向苏联人民反扑。这种情况，对于胜利了的中国人民是特别熟悉的。为了破坏中国人民的革命事业，美帝国主义者在台湾、日本、香港等地训练蒋介石残余匪帮的特务，无时不在伺隙潜入我国进行破坏活动。但这些家伙永远逃不出中国人民的巨掌，正如纳粹特务们逃不出苏联人民的巨掌一样！
    影片“锄奸记”又告诉我们：对国内外敌人必须保持高度的政治警惕性。只要稍一疏忽、有意或无意地泄露了国家机密，都有可能给人民造成严重的损失。在“锄奸记”里，我们看到在前线飞机场欢迎“慰问团”的宴会上，一位苏联空军军官热诚欢迎和隆重招待“慰问团”的全体人员，但拒绝回答关于炮兵阵地在那里的询问，因为这是军事秘密。但也有个别的人，忽视政治斗争的严重性，缺乏应有的警惕性，觉得在自己祖国的土地上，一切都可爱，那里有什么隐蔽的敌人！可是问题就从这里发生了：在同一个宴会上，一位炮兵军官把廖其耶夫的驻址泄露了，结果就让敌人钻了空子。
    斯大林在苏联建国初期曾经称誉过苏维埃国家的保卫工作人员，是“资产阶级的催命符，是革命的警卫兵，是无产阶级的宝剑”。影片“锄奸记”所表现的苏联保卫工作人员的事迹，证明了他们无愧于自己的光荣称号！千锤百炼的苏联保卫工作者们，善于在最复杂、最尖锐的斗争中，随时保持自己的政治敏感，机智地识破敌人的任何狡猾伎俩，给敌人以致命打击；善于在工作中认真调查研究，全面考虑问题，以求最完满地完成任务。这是值得我们学习的。
    影片“锄奸记”的上演，对我国人民有着异常深刻和现实的教育意义。它告诉我们：只要帝国主义侵略势力在世界上还未被消灭，我们就一刻也不能放松对国内外敌人的警惕和斗争！
