The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue 142, has been published.

This issue contains an editorial commemorating May Day, entitled "The Great Day of International Solidarity of the Working People." Other important articles in this issue include "Two Worlds - Two Policies" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party; "New Stage in the Struggle of the German People for Peace and for the Establishment of a Unified, Democratic Germany" by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the German Socialist Unity Party; "Proletarian Internationalism and the Struggle of the Korean People" by Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea; "May Day 1952" by Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain; "Cultural Treasures Are Now in the Hands of the People" by Gheorghe Chisinevschi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; and "Facing the Masses" by Antonín Novotný, Secretary of the Political Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

Duclos's article states: The warmongers, the exploiters and oppressors of the people of all countries, are watching with alarm the growing strength of the peace camp. The oppressed people are determined to break the chains that bind them, and their struggles terrify the colonialists. Therefore, the colonialists do not hesitate to commit all kinds of heinous crimes and atrocities in order to maintain their rule. Duclos's article then exposed the crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare in Korea. He contrasted the increasingly difficult lives of the working people in capitalist countries due to the war preparation policy (using France as an example) with the repeated price reductions in the Soviet Union, and contrasted the attempts of imperialist countries to revive the revanchist army of West Germany with the Soviet Union's struggle to establish a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany. Duclos said: These facts clearly show the existence of two different policies. On the one hand, there is the war policy pursued by the imperialist camp, the inevitable consequence of which is the growth of poverty and the use of fascist methods to crush the resistance of the masses. On the other hand, there is the policy of freedom, independence, and defense of peace pursued by the anti-imperialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union. Duclos concluded by saying: From the current development of the situation, the urgent task facing us, the French Communists, is to specifically oppose war production in factories, oppose the transportation of war materials, oppose the American occupation, and draw the broad masses into this struggle, arousing the anger and indignation of the entire people against the criminals of bacteriological warfare.

Pieck's article detailed how the people of West Germany, including some bourgeois elements, supported the Soviet proposals for a German peace treaty and opposed the Adenauer government's treacherous General Treaty. Pieck said: The West German people's resistance to Adenauer's arms expansion policy has generated new demands for cooperation between the local organizations of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in the workers' movement. This effort to come closer to each other for common goals is most clearly manifested in the municipal elections in southern Germany. In Bavaria, more than eighty people were nominated as joint candidates for unified action. In the industrial center of Nuremberg, the Social Democratic candidate, Mr. Barnreuther, was elected mayor as a result of unified action. Similar results were obtained in other cities in Bavaria. Pieck also said: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party, requesting joint action to jointly oppose the revival of German militarism, strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and strive for the holding of all-German elections to produce a National Assembly. This letter received widespread support among ordinary members of the Social Democratic Party. Ordinary members of the Social Democratic Party no longer believe in anti-Bolshevik slander. This very exciting sign proves that, as a result of the German Communist Party's steady, persistent, and systematic policies, very great achievements have been made. It is necessary to transform this promising beginning of unified action in West Germany into a broad mass movement. This is the condition for the German people to achieve victory in the struggle to safeguard peace and restore German unity.

Pollitt's article said: On this year's May Day, it can be seen that the working people of the world have awakened. More and more of them have joined the struggle to defend peace, strive for national independence, and improve living standards. The achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and China prove that in countries where the working people have mastered their own destiny, their main idea is peace, because only in a peaceful environment can they implement the huge construction tasks that have been started, and only then can they guarantee that their descendants will have a happier life. In the early days of the workers' movement, the vanguard could only abstractly depict the outlines of socialism, but today, everyone can clearly see the reality of socialism's brilliant achievements. Pollitt said: If we jointly intensify our efforts to fight for the sacred cause of peace, the warmongers will suffer new failures in 1952, and the world peace forces will achieve new victories. Novotný's article said: After the Central Committee's plenary session in December 1951, the Party began to smash enemy agents with greater determination and eliminate the influence of sabotage activities. Strengthening the elected Party leadership organs and improving their work has become the main prerequisite necessary to implement Gottwald's call to "face the masses." Since the end of last year, more than 8,000 village meetings have been held under the initiative of the Party. The experience of these mass meetings proves that as long as the Party organization prepares in advance and arranges the meeting work, it can mobilize the masses in urban and rural areas to correctly implement the decisions of the Party and the government. This issue also published Stalin's congratulatory telegram to Polish President Bierut on his sixtieth birthday and Bierut's reply telegram. In the "In the People's Republic of China" section, eight news items were published, including the publication of the second volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in our country. In the "On the Eve of May Day" section, news about the new achievements made by the working people of our country in the May Day competition was published. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四二期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四二期已经出版。
    本期刊载了纪念五一劳动节的社论，题为“劳动人民国际团结的伟大日子”；本期其他重要文章有法国共产党书记杜克洛的“两个世界——两种政策”，德国统一社会党主席皮克的“德国人民为和平、为建立统一民主的德国而斗争的新阶段”，朝鲜劳动党主席金日成的“无产阶级国际主义和朝鲜人民的斗争”，英国共产党总书记波立特的“一九五二年的五一节”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记契西尼夫斯奇的“文化珍宝已掌握在人民手中”，和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治书记处书记诺沃提尼的“面向群众”等。
    杜克洛的文章说：战争贩子、各国人民的剥削者和压迫者惊惶地注视着和平阵营的日益壮大的力量。被压迫人民决心打碎束缚他们的锁链，他们进行的斗争使殖民者心惊胆战。因此，殖民者就不惜犯下一切滔天罪行和暴行，以求维持他们的统治。杜克洛的文章接着揭露了美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行，并举法国为例以资本主义国家的劳动人民由于备战政策生活日益艰难的情况和苏联一再减低物价的情况作了对比，又以帝国主义国家企图恢复西德复仇主义军队和苏联为建立统一的、民主的、独立的、爱好和平的德国而斗争的情形作了对比。杜克洛说：这些事实清楚地显示着两种不同政策的存在，一方面是帝国主义阵营所奉行的战争政策，其不可避免的后果是贫困的增长和为了要击破群众的抵抗而运用法西斯方法。另一方面是以伟大的苏联为首的反帝国主义阵营所奉行的自由、独立和保卫和平的政策。杜克洛最后说：从目前发展的情势中，摆在我们法国共产党人前面的迫切任务就是：具体地在工厂中反对战争生产，反对战争物资的运输，反对美国的占领并把广大的群众吸收到这个斗争中来，唤醒全体人民对细菌战罪犯的愤怒和愤慨。
    皮克的文章详细叙述了西德人民包括若干资产阶级分子在内拥护苏联关于对德和约草案的建议和反对阿登纳卖国的一般性条约的情形。皮克说：西德人民对阿登纳扩张军备政策的反抗，已产生了共产党和社会民主党地方组织在工人阶级运动中进行合作的新要求。这种为共同的目标而彼此靠拢所作的努力，最明白地表现在德国南部的市政选举上，在巴伐利亚，提出了八十多个人作为统一行动的联合名单，在工业中心纽伦堡，社会民主党候选人巴恩鲁特尔由于统一行动的结果当选了市长，在巴伐利亚的其他城市也得到同样结果。皮克又说：统一社会党中央委员会写信给社会民主党中央委员会，要求联合行动共同反对恢复德国军国主义，争取缔结对德和约，争取举行全德选举产生国民议会。这封信在社会民主党的普通党员中，获得了广泛的支持。社会民主党普通党员不再相信反布尔什维克的谰言了，这种令人十分兴奋的征象证明，由于德国共产党的稳步前进的、坚持不渝的、系统的政策的结果，已产生了非常大的成绩，必须把西德这种富有希望的统一行动的开端变成广泛的群众运动，这是德国人民在维护和平、恢复德国统一的斗争中取得胜利的条件。
    波立特的文章说：在今年五一节，可以看到全世界的劳动人民已经觉醒了。他们中间已有越来越多的人投身到保卫和平、争取民族独立和提高生活水平的斗争中来。苏联、人民民主国家和中国的成绩证明，在劳动人民掌握了自己命运的国家里，他们的主要思想是和平，因为在和平环境中，他们才能贯彻已着手进行的巨大建设任务，才可保证他们的后代过更幸福的生活。在工人阶级运动初期，先锋队只能抽象地描绘出社会主义的轮廓，但在今天，每个人都可以清楚地看见社会主义辉煌成就的现实。波立特说：如果我们共同加紧努力为神圣的和平事业而奋斗，一九五二年，战争贩子就会遭到新的失败，世界和平力量就会取得新的胜利。诺沃提尼的文章说：党在一九五一年十二月中央委员会的全体会议后，开始以更大决心粉碎敌探分子并消灭破坏活动的影响，加强选举出来的党的领导机关并改进它们的工作，已成为实行哥特瓦尔德的“面向群众”的号召所必需的主要的先决条件了。去年年底以来，在党的倡导之下，已召开了八千次以上的村民大会，这些群众会议的经验证明，只要党的组织事前作好准备和布置会议工作，就能动员城市和乡村的群众正确执行党和政府的决定。本期并刊载了斯大林在波兰总统贝鲁特六十寿辰时给贝鲁特的贺电和贝鲁特的复电，并在“在中华人民共和国”一栏下刊载了我国出版“毛泽东选集”第二卷等八则消息，在“五一节前夕”一栏下，登载了我国劳动人民在庆祝五一竞赛中获得新成就的消息。（新华社）
