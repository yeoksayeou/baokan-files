Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 28th. Since the Dodd incident, American aggressors have frantically resorted to numerous shameless and evasive tactics, attempting to cover up their monstrous crimes of cruelly murdering our captured personnel. However, these vile and clumsy methods have been declared bankrupt in the face of undeniable facts. Exhausted and bored, the American aggressors have recently resorted to the old trick of "stop thief!" wildly spreading rumors and falsely claiming that our captured personnel had "internal conflicts," resulting in casualties, etc., attempting to evade responsibility for this. However, this despicable act of reversing right and wrong by the American aggressors not only fails to absolve them of the serious crime of massacring our captured personnel on a large scale, but also provides more confessions for their crimes.

The Associated Press correspondent in Geoje Island, on the 26th, cited the remarks of U.S. prisoner-of-war hospital officials and so-called "hospital records" in a dispatch, which is a typical example of this rumor-mongering by the American aggressors. This news said that according to U.S. prisoner-of-war hospital officials, since the establishment of the prisoner-of-war hospital on July 2 last year, "at least 415 prisoners of war have died," of which "at least 115 prisoners died from beatings, strangulation and torture." These "officials," who take pleasure in killing wounded and sick prisoners of war, have confused black and white and fabricated that the incidents of death caused by "beatings, strangulation and torture" occurred in "conflicts between communist elements and anti-communist elements" among our captured personnel, and that "hospital records" serve as "proof." However, these false proofs, like other fabrications by the American aggressors, cannot stand up to scrutiny in the face of facts. A United Press International dispatch from Geoje Island on January 21 already admitted: Geoje Island has become "an island of terror," where "riots, torture and assassination are intertwined into a terrifying picture in the daily lives of the prisoners." The reason for this dark and bleak scene is precisely because the American aggressors colluded with the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee gang's special agents, using various bloody means, including "beatings, strangulation and torture," to create conditions for forcibly detaining our captured personnel. Captured U.S. special agents have repeatedly confessed and confirmed these crimes. Wang Jiati, Liu Chenghan, Mou Bingyun, Tan Guangqing and others, who were captured by our army and served in the 72nd Regiment of the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, confessed that the U.S., Chiang, and Rhee gangs often conducted illegal torture on our captured personnel, hanging them up for beatings and even executing them. At the same time, Choi Song-ok, a corporal of the Korean People's Army who recently escaped from the U.S. 76th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, accused that the U.S. 76th prisoner-of-war camp "also has four gallows for slaughtering and threatening our captured personnel." In addition, according to the statement issued by Clark, the newly appointed so-called Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, on May 12 regarding Dodd's detention, former prisoner-of-war camp commander Colson, in reply to the demands raised by our captured personnel, also admitted the bloody crimes of the American aggressors in abusing and killing our captured personnel in the past. Colson replied: "Regarding the first point in your letter, I certainly acknowledge that there have been bloody incidents, resulting in many prisoners of war being killed or injured. I can guarantee to you that the prisoners of war in this camp can hope to receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law in the future. I am willing to do everything in my power to prevent violent actions and bloody incidents from happening again."

It can be seen that it is the American aggressors and their pawns, the Chiang and Rhee gangs' special agents, who used "beatings, strangulation and torture" to kill our captured personnel. The slander that our unarmed captured personnel "conflicted with each other," resulting in a large number of casualties, is obviously a vicious fabrication. Its purpose is not only to deceive the world and cover up the bloody crimes of the American aggressors, but also to attempt to divert attention and quell the growing discontent among the satellite countries.

The same Associated Press news had to admit frankly: "During the same period, 122 prisoners of war died from gunshot wounds," and they were also shot by the American aggressors. The Associated Press said that "hospital records" show that "the cases of prisoners of war being fatally shot are concentrated in the three major incidents that occurred on Geoje Island this year." The first incident occurred on February 18, when "82 North Korean prisoners of war in Camp No. 62 were killed by guards for refusing to cooperate with the authorities in interrogating prisoners of war"; the second incident occurred on March 13, when "South Korean guards opened fire on Camp No. 19," "killing 10 prisoners of war on the spot and two other prisoners of war died soon after"; the third incident occurred on April 10, when "three prisoners of war were seriously injured." Only two days earlier (on the 24th), Reuters had revealed that in this massacre, 30 of our captured personnel were killed and 57 were injured. Although the U.S. prisoner-of-war hospital authorities tried their best to reduce and conceal the number of our captured personnel shot by the U.S. military, they had to admit that the murderers who shot innocent captured personnel were the American aggressors.

The American aggressors' crimes of massacring our captured personnel on a large scale are already conclusive and cannot be denied. Even one of its accomplices, the Canadian government, has affirmed this crime and is unwilling to share responsibility. The myth created by the American aggressors about our captured personnel "conflicting with each other" will not only not alleviate the blood debt they owe, but will only expose their crimes more to the people of the world.

### 美国侵略者妄图推脱虐杀战俘的严重罪责  竟捏造我被俘人员“自相冲突”的无耻谎言

    美国侵略者妄图推脱虐杀战俘的严重罪责
    竟捏造我被俘人员“自相冲突”的无耻谎言
    【新华社开城二十八日电】自从杜德事件发生以后，美国侵略者曾手忙脚乱地施用许多无耻狡赖的手法，妄图掩盖其残酷虐杀我方被俘人员的滔天罪行。但是，这些卑鄙而拙劣的手法在不容置辩的事实的面前，纷纷宣告破产。美国侵略者穷极无聊，近日竟又施用“贼喊捉贼”的故技，大肆造谣，诬称我方被俘人员“自相冲突”，以致造成伤亡云云，妄图借此推脱罪责。但是，美国侵略者这种颠倒是非的卑鄙行为，不但不能开脱其大批虐杀我方被俘人员的严重罪行，而恰恰为其罪行提出了更多的供状。
    美联社驻巨济岛的记者二十六日引用美方战俘医院官员的谈话和所谓“医院记录”所发的消息，是美国侵略者这一造谣的典型例子。这一消息说，据美方战俘医院官员透露，自从去年七月二日该战俘医院成立以来，“至少有四百十五名战俘死去”，其中“至少有一百十五名俘虏由于受到毒打、绞杀和酷刑而死”。这些以残杀伤病的战俘为能事的“官员”竟混淆黑白地捏造说，因“毒打、绞杀和酷刑”致死的事件，产生在我方被俘人员中“共产党分子与反共分子的冲突中”，并且有“医院记录”为“证”。但是，这些伪证和美国侵略者的其他捏造一样，在事实的面前是站不住脚的。合众社巨济岛一月二十一日电早已承认：巨济岛已经成了“恐怖之岛”，“暴乱、酷刑、暗杀在这里的俘虏日常生活中交织成一幅恐怖的图画”。所以产生这种暗无天日的景象，正是由于美国侵略者勾结蒋介石和李承晚匪帮的特务分子，使用包括“毒打、绞杀和酷刑”在内的各种血腥手段，为强迫扣留我方被俘人员制造条件。落网的美方特务更多次地招供和证实了这些罪行。被我军捕获的曾在巨济岛战俘营第七十二联队供职的美军特务王家悌、刘承汉、牟秉云、谭广清等就供认：美、蒋、李匪帮经常对我方被俘人员进行非法刑讯，吊打以致处死。同时，最近从巨济岛美方第七十六号战俘营脱险的我方被俘人员朝鲜人民军下士崔松玉控诉说：美方第七十六号战俘营“还有用以屠杀和威胁我们被俘人员的四个绞刑台”。此外，根据新任所谓联合国军总司令克拉克于五月十二日发表的关于杜德被扣留的声明，前任战俘营长官柯尔生在答覆我方被俘人员所提出的要求时，也承认了美国侵略者过去虐杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行。柯尔生答覆说：“关于你们来信中的第一条，我肯定承认有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被打死或打伤，我可以向你们提出保证，将来这个俘虏营里的战俘可以希望得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇。我愿尽自己的一切力量，使暴力行动与流血事件不再发生。”
    由此可见，用“毒打、绞杀和酷刑”杀害我方被俘人员的正是美国侵略者及其爪牙蒋李匪帮的特务；诬称手无寸铁的我方被俘人员“互相冲突”，以致造成大批伤亡的谰言，显然是一个恶毒的捏造，其目的不仅在于欺骗世人，掩盖美国侵略者的血腥罪行，而且企图借以转移视线，平息仆从国家中日益增长的不满。
    美联社的同一消息又不得不率直地承认：“在同一时期内，有一百二十二名俘虏死于枪伤”，枪杀他们的也是美国侵略者。美联社说，“医院记录”表明，“俘虏被枪杀致命的案件都集中在巨济岛今年发生的三大事件中”。第一个事件发生在二月十八日，“第六十二号营场有八十二名（按美方最初仅公布七十五名）北朝鲜俘虏，由于拒绝当局进行讯问俘虏的工作”，“被卫兵打死”；第二个事件发生在三月十三日，“南朝鲜卫兵向第十九号营场开枪”，“有十名俘虏当场被打死，另有两名俘虏不久死去”；第三个事件发生在四月十日“有三名战俘重伤”。而仅在两天以前（二十四日），路透社已经透露，在这次惨案中，我方被俘人员有三十人被打死，五十七人被打伤。尽管美方战俘医院当局尽量缩小和隐瞒被美军枪杀的我方被俘人员的数字，但是他们却不得不承认：枪杀无辜的我方被俘人员的凶手正是美国侵略者。
    美国侵略者大批屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行已经是罪证确凿，不容抵赖，甚至它的帮凶之一加拿大政府都肯定了这一罪行而不愿分担责任。美国侵略者制造的关于我方被俘人员“自相冲突”的神话不但丝毫不能减轻它欠下的血债，而且只有使它的罪行更多地暴露在全世界人民的面前。
