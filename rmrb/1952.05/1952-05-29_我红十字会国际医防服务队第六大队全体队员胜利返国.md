Xinhua News Agency, 27th. All fifty-two members of the Sixth Detachment of the Chinese Red Cross International Medical and Epidemic Prevention Service Team, led by Detachment Leader Zhang Zhixiang, have returned victoriously after working on the Korean front for more than nine months. Except for the members from Qingdao and Tangshan who returned directly to their respective locations, a small team composed of members from Guangdong arrived in Beijing on the 26th. Hu Lansheng, Vice President of the Red Cross Society of China, and representatives from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and others welcomed them at the station. The detachment included two surgical teams composed of medical personnel from Qingdao, one internal medicine team and one orthopedic team from Tangshan, and one infectious disease team from the Guangzhou Red Cross branch, totaling five teams. The team members demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity on the Korean front, creating many methods in difficult environments to accelerate the recovery of the wounded and reduce the suffering of convalescents. The "functional exercise method for injured limbs" advocated by Deputy Detachment Leader Kou Yongli shortened the time for many convalescents to recover the function of their injured limbs, meeting their demands to return to the front lines as soon as possible. The "agile method of transporting the wounded" devised by Doctor Ding Lukun only takes a short time to transport a wounded person, greatly reducing the suffering of the wounded during transportation and accidental injuries during transportation.

    我红十字会国际医防服务队第六大队全体队员胜利返国
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国红十字会国际医防服务队第六大队全体队员共五十二人，在大队长张之湘领导下在朝鲜前线工作九个多月后，已胜利归国。除青岛、唐山的队员直接返回各该地外，其中广东所组成的一小队已在二十六日到达北京。中国红十字会总会副会长胡兰生和中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会代表等多人到车站欢迎。该大队包括青岛医务人员组成的两个外科队，唐山的内科、骨科各一个队和广州市红十字分会传染病科一个队，共五个小队。队员们在朝鲜前线发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，在艰苦环境中创造了许多办法，加速恢复伤员健康，减少休养员的痛苦。副大队长寇用礼提倡的“伤肢功能练习方法”，缩短了许多休养员伤肢功能恢复的时间，满足了他们提早重返前线的要求。医师丁履坤想出的“敏捷搬运伤员法”，只需很短的时间就可以搬运一个伤员，大大减少了伤员们在搬运中的痛苦和在搬运中的意外损伤。
