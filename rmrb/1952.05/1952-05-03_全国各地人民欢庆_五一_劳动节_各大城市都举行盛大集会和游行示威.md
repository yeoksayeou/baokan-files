People across the country warmly celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day. On May 1st, major cities such as Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Xi'an held grand rallies and parades with hundreds of thousands of people participating.

    North China

In Tianjin, 400,000 people held parades in different districts on May 1st. Participants included workers from public and private factories and stores, as well as youth, women, students, business leaders, and religious figures. In the afternoon, a celebration meeting was held in the city's central district. 40,000 people from the parade teams in various districts participated in the meeting and were reviewed by Mayor Huang Jing and others. In the workers' parade, many production excellence award banners, certificates, and production charts were held high, demonstrating the glorious achievements of Tianjin workers in their hard work of production. Construction workers held high the nine new types of civil engineering tools created recently in the construction worker dormitory project and models of the newly built worker dormitories, expressing their labor enthusiasm and happy lives.

In North China, more than 300,000 working people in the provincial capitals of Baoding, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Xinxiang, and Gui Sui enthusiastically celebrated "May Day," with each city holding celebration parades. The celebration parades in the provincial capitals unanimously protested the crime of American imperialism using bacteriological weapons.

    Northeast

In Shenyang, on the morning of "May Day", a team of 500,000 people gathered from various locations to nine venues. The parade began at nine o'clock, with teams departing simultaneously from the nine venues. More than 300 industrial labor models wore various medals. They had led the workers of Northeast China to successfully complete production tasks. Last year, the total value of increased production and savings in various public factories was equal to 16 million tons of grain, of which Shenyang completed 3.7 million tons. Before this year's "May Day," workers also launched a "May Day" competition in public enterprises in various places on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement. As of April 29th, more than 200 production units in Shenyang had completed their April production plans ahead of schedule, and many factories had set new goals. Private enterprise workers who were at the forefront of the "Five-Anti" struggle also actively participated in the parade. What was particularly noticeable in this year's parade was the people's health workers. These epidemic prevention team members have gained rich experience in shattering the bacteriological warfare of American aggressors in the actual battle of the past two months. The victorious people of Shenyang ruthlessly ridiculed the American aggressors. The marchers carried many cartoons, and on a propaganda vehicle, along with models of flies, mosquitoes, spiders, and mice, was an image of an American bacteriological war criminal on the gallows.

    East China

In Shanghai, the "May Day" demonstration parade was held simultaneously in the central, Pudong, and Puxi areas, with approximately 300,000 people from all walks of life participating in the celebration of this glorious festival despite the rain. In the People's Square in the city center, representatives from all walks of life, mainly workers and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, held a grand celebration meeting. At 10:30 am, the parade began. Shanghai Mayor Chen Yi and East China Military and Political Committee Vice Chairman Zeng Shan and others reviewed the parade of more than 150,000 people participating in the central district. At the forefront of the team were hundreds of industrial and agricultural labor models, advanced production workers, newly promoted worker cadres, and naval, land and air force combat heroes. The huge worker contingent used countless production charts and models to show that after the basic victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the Shanghai working class is welcoming a new upsurge in the patriotic production increase and savings movement with new achievements in production. Following the worker ranks were teams of suburban farmers who had come from dozens of miles away, as well as teams of youth, women, cultural and educational circles, and business circles. Simultaneously with the parade, various celebrations were held in every corner of the city.

The political consciousness of the 120,000 employees of private enterprises in the city has been unprecedentedly raised after the anti-embezzlement movement.

The private machinery industry in Wuhan recently processed and manufactured more than 100,000 tools and parts for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, which fully met the specifications and standards and were delivered on schedule. This has never happened before. However, the workers are not satisfied with these achievements. They held high their newly formulated patriotic covenants, guaranteeing to consolidate the great achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and strive for higher production levels. Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan, where land reform is underway, also sent representatives to participate in the demonstration parade.
