The people of the capital spent a jubilant "May Day" night. Although it was drizzling, public places and main streets were still crowded with joyful people. Tiananmen Square, like during the day, became the center of joy for the entire city. More than 100,000 workers, students, and other people braved the rain to dance and watch performances there. The Cultural Palace of the Working People and Zhongshan Park near the square were also packed with people.

Tiananmen Square was brightly lit, like daytime. The roofs and eaves of the city gate tower were decorated with rows of lights, making this magnificent building particularly brilliant. Countless large red stars were also lit up on the tall buildings around the square. Colorful fireworks constantly appeared in the air, and there were also more than a dozen searchlights cutting through the night sky, which was extremely spectacular.

In the center of the square, many artists performed wonderful programs. Countless people sang and danced.

In the Labor Theater of the Cultural Palace of the Working People and the Concert Hall of Zhongshan Park, people enjoyed various cultural and recreational programs. All the open spaces in the Cultural Palace and Zhongshan Park were filled with people singing and dancing.

The spring rain kept falling. Some people held umbrellas, some wore raincoats, and more people let the rain drench them, singing and dancing regardless, exuding a very touching optimism and fearless spirit.

Many factories and organizations in the capital held dance parties in the evening.

    首都人民
    欢度“五一”节之夜
    天安门广场成为全城欢乐中心
    昨天五万多工人游园联欢
    首都“五一”节之夜在狂欢中度过。虽然春雨霏霏，各公共场所和主要街道上仍到处拥挤着欢乐的人们。天安门广场像白天一样，成为全城欢乐的中心，冒雨在这儿跳舞和参观表演的工人、学生和其他人民群众在十万人以上。广场附近劳动人民文化宫和中山公园里面，也同样挤满了人。
    天安门广场上电炬辉煌，如同白昼。城楼的屋脊和屋檐上装饰着成排的灯光，使这座雄伟的建筑格外光辉灿烂。广场周围的高大建筑物上也亮着无数大红星。半空不断出现五颜六色的焰火，还有十数道划破夜空的探照灯光，极为壮观。
    在广场中央，许多技艺家演出精彩节目。无数的人群载歌载舞。
    在劳动人民文化宫的劳动剧场和中山公园的音乐堂，人们欣赏着各种文娱节目。文化宫和中山公园的所有空地上，到处是亦歌亦舞的人群。
    春雨不停地下着。有的人撑着伞，有的人穿着雨衣，更多的人让雨淋着，不顾一切地歌唱着、跳舞着，洋溢着十分感人的乐观主义和无畏气概。
    首都的许多工厂和机关，晚上都举行了跳舞晚会。
