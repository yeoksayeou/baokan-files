Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 20th: The Japanese Diet's Senate began discussing the reactionary "Anti-Subversive Activities" bill targeting progressive groups on May 19th. The bill had already been passed by the Diet's House of Representatives on May 15th. Communist Party member of the House of Representatives, Kato Mitsuru, spoke at the assembly, emphasizing the difficult situation Japan has been placed in due to seven years of occupation and the conclusion of the so-called "peace treaty." When mentioning the bill, Kato Mitsuru said that if the bill is passed, it would be tantamount to publicly announcing the implementation of a fascist dictatorship and challenging peace and freedom. A country that implements such a bill is a colony, and the Shigeru Yoshida government proposing the bill is a puppet government. Kato Mitsuru emphasized that those who support the bill are traitors.

    日共议员在参议院发言
    反对通过法西斯法案
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社东京二十日讯：日本国会参议院于五月十九日开始讨论针对进步团体的“防止破坏活动”的反动法案。该法案已于五月十五日由国会众议院通过。共产党众议员加藤充曾在大会上发言，着重指出由于七年的占领及缔结所谓“和约”而使日本陷于困难境地。加藤充提到该法案时说，如果通过该法案，那就等于公开宣布实行法西斯独裁，而向和平与自由挑战。实行这种法案的国家是一个殖民地，建议该法案的吉田茂政府是一个傀儡政府。加藤充强调说，那些赞成该法案的人们都是卖国贼。
