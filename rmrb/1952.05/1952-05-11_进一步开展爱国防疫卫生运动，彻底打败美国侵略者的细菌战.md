    Further Develop the Patriotic Anti-Epidemic Health Campaign to Thoroughly Defeat the American Invaders' Germ Warfare
    Recently, in order to defeat the American invaders' germ warfare and to prevent our people, livestock, poultry, and crops from being harmed by epidemics, our health workers and the broad masses of the people have launched a large-scale patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign and have achieved great results. Like the front and rear areas of Korea, our people in the Northeast and Qingdao areas, where the enemy spread bacteria and poisonous insects, have won the first round of the anti-germ warfare. In these areas, the enemy's despicable plot to cause epidemics by spreading bacteria and poisonous insects has not succeeded. In other areas not contaminated by the enemy's bacteria and poisonous insects, our people's health and hygiene have also greatly advanced due to the development of the anti-epidemic health campaign. These facts prove that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, our people are capable of defeating the enemy's vicious germ warfare. However, on the other hand, the enemy's atrocities of spreading bacteria and poisonous insects have not stopped, and the risk of epidemics is increasing due to the warmer weather. Moreover, the development of the anti-epidemic health campaign still has the weaknesses of being uneven, not widespread, and not deep enough. Therefore, our health and epidemic prevention workers and all the people must continue to heighten their vigilance, make persistent efforts, and launch a deep and widespread patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign to thoroughly defeat the American invaders' germ warfare.
    According to the report of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of American Imperialism's Germ Warfare," composed of Chinese scientists and representatives of people's organizations, the germs, viruses, and fungi spread by the enemy in Korea and Northeast China include malignant encephalitis viruses harmful to humans, and bacteria such as plague, cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, dysentery, and anthrax; anthrax bacilli and hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella harmful to livestock (cattle, horses, donkeys, mules) and poultry; and fungi such as soybean purple spot disease and wheat black spot disease harmful to crops, as well as agricultural pests such as locusts and crickets (oil gourds) that directly harm crops. This means that the enemy's germ warfare is aimed at the people, livestock, poultry, and crops of China and Korea. In response to the enemy's conspiracy, our people's anti-epidemic health campaign must include three aspects: preventing human epidemics, preventing livestock and poultry epidemics, and preventing crop diseases and insect pests. That is to say, we must carry out a clean and hygienic movement to keep our clothes, food, and indoor and outdoor areas clean, protect water sources, eliminate disease-carrying agents such as flies, rats, fleas, lice, and mosquitoes, and implement vaccinations. We must carry out a movement to prevent livestock and poultry epidemics, keep the food and living places of livestock and poultry clean, and vaccinate livestock to prevent the spread of livestock and poultry epidemics. We must carry out a movement to catch and kill crop pests and prevent crop diseases.
    An important step in further developing the patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign is to widely educate the public on epidemic prevention and health knowledge. Epidemic prevention and health workers, reporters, and propagandists in various places should widely publicize to the masses based on materials such as the "Common Knowledge of Defending Against Germ Warfare" and "Common Knowledge of Epidemic Prevention" compiled by the All-China Medical Association.
    The key to launching a widespread and in-depth patriotic anti-epidemic health campaign is to require our broad masses of people to develop a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity. People across the country should learn from the experience of the people in the Northeast, incorporate the goal of doing a good job in patriotic anti-epidemic health work into patriotic covenants, or formulate separate patriotic anti-epidemic health covenants, regularly check the implementation of the covenant provisions, summarize experiences, launch a competition for patriotic anti-epidemic health work, commend exemplary units and individuals, and promote advanced experiences in doing a good job in epidemic prevention and health work.
    In short, as long as our health and epidemic prevention workers and all the people unite and act together, the enemy's germ warfare offensive can be thoroughly defeated by us. Only by thoroughly defeating the enemy's germ warfare can our national patriotic production increase and thrift movement achieve a guarantee of victory. Let us all the people of the country work together and strive to achieve this goal.

    进一步开展爱国防疫卫生运动，彻底打败美国侵略者的细菌战
    最近以来，我国卫生工作者和广大人民，为了战胜美国侵略者的细菌战，使我国人民和我国的家畜、家禽和农作物不受到疫病的危害，开展了大规模的爱国防疫卫生运动，并且获得了很大成绩。和朝鲜的前线、后方一样，我国人民在敌人撒布细菌毒虫的东北及青岛等地区，已经取得了反细菌战的第一个回合的胜利。在这些地区，敌人企图以撒布细菌毒虫来引起疫病流行的卑鄙阴谋，并未得逞。在未被敌人的细菌毒虫污染的其他地区，由于防疫卫生运动的开展，我国人民的保健卫生事业也已经大大前进一步。这些事实证明，我国人民在毛主席、共产党和中央人民政府领导下，是能够打败敌人的恶毒的细菌战的。但是另一方面，敌人撒布细菌毒虫的暴行并未停止，而由于天气日暖，疫病流行的危险性增大，并且防疫卫生运动的发展也还存在着不平衡、不普遍、不深入的弱点，因此，我国卫生防疫工作者和全体人民，必须继续提高警惕，再接再厉、深入普遍地开展爱国防疫卫生运动，来彻底打败美国侵略者的细菌战。
    根据由我国科学家和人民团体代表组成的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”的报告，敌人在朝鲜及我国东北撒布的病菌、病毒和真菌，包括了危害人类的恶性脑炎病毒和鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒、痢疾、炭疽等病菌，危害家畜（牛、马、驴、骡）和家禽的炭疽杆菌和出血性败血病巴氏杆菌，和危害农作物的大豆紫斑病和小麦黑斑病等真菌，以及直接危害农作物的蝗虫、蟋蟀（油葫芦）等类农业害虫在内。这就是说，敌人的细菌战是以中朝两国的人民、家畜家禽和农作物为对象的。针对敌人的这种阴谋，我国人民的防疫卫生运动，必须包括预防人的疫病、预防家畜家禽的疫病和预防农作物的病虫害这样三种内容。这就是说，我们要开展清洁卫生运动，使我们的衣被食物和户内户外经常保持清洁，保护水源，消灭苍蝇、老鼠、跳蚤、虱子和蚊子等传染病的媒介物，并实行预防注射。我们要开展预防家畜家禽疫病的运动，保持家畜、家禽食物及住处的清洁，并对家畜实行预防注射，防止家畜、家禽疫病的流行。我们要开展捕灭农作物害虫的运动，并防治农作物的病害。
    进一步开展爱国防疫卫生运动的一个重要步骤，就是普遍地进行关于防疫卫生知识的教育。各地防疫卫生工作者和报告员、宣传员，都要根据中华医学会总会所编写的“防御细菌战的常识”和“防疫常识”等材料，向人民群众作广泛的宣传。
    普遍深入地开展爱国防疫卫生运动的决定关键就是要求我们广大人民，大家发扬高度的爱国热忱和积极性、创造性。全国各地的人民都要学习东北人民的经验，把做好爱国防疫卫生工作的目标订入爱国公约之内，或者另订爱国防疫卫生公约，定期检查公约条文的执行程度，总结经验，展开爱国防疫卫生工作的竞赛，表扬模范的单位和个人，推广做好防疫卫生工作的先进经验。
    总之，只要我国卫生防疫工作者和全体人民团结一致地行动起来，敌人的细菌战攻势是能够被我们彻底打败的。也只有彻底打败敌人的细菌战，我们全国人民的爱国增产节约运动才能够取得胜利的保障。让我们全国人民一致努力，为达到这个目的而奋斗。
