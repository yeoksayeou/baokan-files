Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th: The "Pravda" published on May 18th, Lasadin's international commentary on the Korean armistice negotiations. He pointed out: The current deadlock in the Panmunjom talks is due to the fact that the US ruling groups not only do not want a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, but stubbornly obstruct the resolution of this issue.

During the negotiation process, the Korean and Chinese sides continuously put forward proposals aimed at establishing peace in Korea. The US military, on the contrary, under the guise of so-called hopes for an "armistice," their heinous crimes in Korea are increasing day by day.

From the beginning of the armistice negotiations, the US aggressors have continuously created provocative incidents, and even openly strafed and bombed the Korean and Chinese delegation in Kaesong. After the negotiations had officially begun, the US aggressors launched the "Autumn Offensive," attempting to force the Korean people to submit to their will. They began to barbarously bomb Korean towns and villages, using napalm bombs to burn civilians – the old, the weak, women and children. The US imperialists again used bacteriological weapons, trampling all standards of human morality underfoot and shamelessly violating international agreements.

How can people believe the so-called hopes for Korean "peace" from US diplomats and generals?

The heinous crimes of the US interventionist army on Geoje Island and their atrocities in massacring Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have shown the world that the US aggressors have embarked on the path of brutality of the Hitler bandits and have committed the acts of bloodthirsty bandits.

In order to achieve their criminal goals, the US authorities vainly attempt to forcibly detain a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, forcing them to betray their motherland, so as to use them as cannon fodder.

Lasadin pointed out: Thanks to the efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides, there is now an opportunity to bring the Panmunjom talks to a successful conclusion; however, the US side has adopted provocative measures, wanting to sabotage the negotiations.

Lasadin concluded: The US ruling groups are afraid of peace. US arms manufacturers have made huge profits from the blood and suffering of the people. They want to maintain international tensions and expand armaments. This is why they are now doing their utmost to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations.

    苏联“真理报”发表国际评论
    斥美方蓄意破坏谈判
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”十八日发表拉萨丁关于朝鲜停战谈判的国际评论。他指出：板门店谈判目前陷于僵局，是由于美国统治集团不但不愿和平解决朝鲜问题，而且顽固地阻挠这一问题的解决。
    在谈判过程中，朝中方面不断提出以建立朝鲜和平为目的的建议。美国军方则恰恰相反。在所谓希望“停战”的花言巧语的掩护下，他们在朝鲜的滔天罪行日新月异，层出不穷。
    从停战谈判开始时起，美国侵略者就接连不断地制造挑衅事件，甚至公然扫射和轰炸开城的朝中代表团。在谈判已经正式开始之后，美国侵略者发动了“秋季攻击”，妄图迫使朝鲜人民屈从他们的意旨。他们开始野蛮地轰炸朝鲜城镇和乡村，使用凝固汽油弹来焚烧平民——老弱妇孺。美帝国主义者又使用了细菌武器，将人类道德的一切标准践踏在脚下，厚颜无耻地破坏了国际协定。
    人们怎能相信美国外交家和将军们的所谓希望朝鲜“和平”的花言巧语呢？
    美国干涉军在巨济岛的万恶罪行和他们屠杀朝中战俘的暴行，已经向全世界表明了：美国侵略者已经走上了希特勒匪帮的暴虐无道的道路，干出了嗜血成性的土匪的行径。
    为了达到他们的罪恶目的，美国当局妄想强迫扣留大批朝中战俘，逼迫他们背叛祖国，以便利用他们当炮灰。
    拉萨丁指出：由于朝中方面的努力，现在是有机会使板门店谈判顺利结束的；但美国方面却采取了挑衅手段，想要破坏谈判。
    拉萨丁在结语中说：美国统治集团害怕和平。美国军火制造商利用人民的鲜血和苦难取得了极大的利润。他们想要保持国际紧张局势和扩张军备。这就是他们现在为什么要竭力破坏朝鲜停战谈判的原因。
