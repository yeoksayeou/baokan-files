    New Method of Childbirth Begins to Be Promoted Among Ethnic Minorities in Lijiang Prefecture, Yunnan
    In more than forty villages inhabited by ethnic minorities in the Sixth District of Heqing County, Lijiang Prefecture, Yunnan Province, midwives are now available, ensuring the safety of women during childbirth.
    In the past, the Minjia, some Yi, and Han people here lived in extreme poverty and backwardness under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. During childbirth, they used ancient methods of delivery, causing immense suffering to the mothers. In cases of difficult labor, eight or nine out of ten women and their babies died. In February of this year, the medical team sent by the Yunnan Provincial People's Government to the earthquake-stricken areas in northwestern Yunnan established an accelerated midwifery training class in the Sixth District of Heqing County. The local women were overjoyed to hear this news. Women from various villages carefully selected fifty-four women to participate in the accelerated midwifery training class.
    These fifty-four women had all given birth, but none had raised their children to adulthood. In the past, they could only think with tears in their eyes, "It must be fate to have so few." Now, after learning the principles of the new method of childbirth, they were deeply saddened by the memory of their children who had died from diseases due to the old method of delivery and cried bitterly. Xue Shanying, a Minjia woman, had given birth to six children, none of whom lived past a month. She said painfully, "In the past, we didn't understand the methods of childbirth, and all the little babies died unjustly." Therefore, they demonstrated full enthusiasm in their studies, overcoming the difficulties of illiteracy and lack of understanding of the Han language, and studying diligently day and night. On the day of the graduation ceremony, they all went to the statue of Chairman Mao and swore, "We will bring Chairman Mao's kindness to every village."
    After returning to their villages, they actively promoted the benefits of the new method of childbirth. In Datong Village and Niujie Village, women's meetings were held for four nights in a row, and the women who attended packed the place. The more they listened, the happier they became. An old woman affectionately instructed her daughter-in-law, "Listen carefully; you young people are now blessed."
    Chen Ruiyu, Yang Yichun, and Duan Ruiyu from Niujie Village were among the best performers in the accelerated midwifery training class. They were not only able to deliver babies in normal childbirth situations but also handle difficult labor. Duan Erxiang's wife from Longmenshao Village had a difficult labor and had not given birth after two days and two nights. The family was distraught and weeping. After hearing about it, Chen Ruiyu and others rushed from more than ten miles away, comforted everyone, and immediately had the mother lie on the bed. After two hours of midwifery surgery, the baby was finally delivered safely. The relatives of the mother and the women who came to visit turned their sorrow into joy. The mother of the woman in labor said, "Without you, how could my daughter have lived; without Chairman Mao, how could you have learned the new method of childbirth."
    In the past month, these trained midwives have delivered more than forty babies in the entire district, and each time both mother and child have been safe. Therefore, the new method of childbirth has become one of the happy events circulating among the local ethnic minorities.

### 云南丽江专区少数民族中开始推广新法接生

    云南丽江专区少数民族中开始推广新法接生
    云南省丽江专区鹤庆县第六区少数民族聚居的四十多个村庄，现在都有了接生员；妇女生产的安全有了保障。
    过去，这里的民家族、一部分彝族和汉族在国民党反动统治时期，过着非常贫困、落后的生活，妇女生产时全用古老的方法接生，产妇受尽了痛苦，遇到难产的妇女更是十之八九大小双亡。今年二月，云南省人民政府派到滇西北地震灾区工作的医疗队，在鹤庆县第六区办了一个助产速成训练班。当地妇女们听到这个消息，都非常高兴。各村妇女慎重地推选出五十四个妇女，参加助产速成训练班学习。
    这五十四个妇女，都生过孩子，可是没有一个把孩子养大的。以前，她们只是含着眼泪想：“该有几个，命中注定。”现在，她们经过学习后，懂得了新法接生的道理，想起她们由于旧法接生而染病死去的孩子，便难过得痛哭起来。民家族妇女薛善英生过六胎，都没有满月就死了。她痛苦地说：“过去不懂接生法，把小宝宝都冤死了。”因此她们在学习中发挥了充分的积极性，克服了不识字和不懂汉话的困难，不分日夜地进行苦学。在举行毕业式那天，她们纷纷走到毛主席像前宣誓：“要把毛主席的恩惠带到各村去。”
    她们回到村里后，积极宣传新法接生的好处。大同村、牛街村都接连开了四个晚上的妇女大会，参加大会的妇女挤得满坑满谷，大家愈听愈高兴。老婆婆亲切地嘱咐媳妇说：“好好听着，你们年青人现在享福了。”
    牛街村的陈瑞玉、杨宜春和段瑞玉，是助产速成训练班成绩最好的几个，她们不但在妇女一般顺利生产的情况下能够接生，并且能接难产。龙门哨村段二祥的妻子难产，两天两夜没有产下，一家人哭得没法，陈瑞玉等听到后，便从十多里路以外赶来，安慰了大家，并立刻让产妇躺在床上，经过两小时的助产手术，终于安全产下。产妇的家属和来看的妇女都转忧为喜，产妇的母亲说：“没有你们，我的女儿怎能活；没有毛主席，你们怎能学到新式接生法。”
    最近一个月来，这些经过训练的接生员们在全区共接生四十多次，每次都是大小安全。因此，新法接生已成为当地少数民族中流传的喜事之一。
