Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th – Since the Korean armistice negotiations entered the delegation's administrative meetings on April 28th, our side presented a reasonable and compromise-based comprehensive plan for the unresolved issues on May 2nd. However, since May 2nd, the opposing side has consistently adopted an arrogant attitude of refusing to negotiate, once again attempting to use the form of administrative meetings to deceive and mislead the people of the world. In order to reveal the truth of the meetings to the world and thoroughly expose the opposing side's unilateral and unreasonable stance, our side formally proposed ending the administrative meeting format and entering public negotiations at the delegation meeting on May 7th. The full text of the speech by our chief representative, General Nam Il, is as follows:

    "On April 28th, your side suggested holding administrative meetings of the delegation, claiming that your side believed the administrative meeting format was best suited for comprehensively resolving unresolved issues. However, since entering administrative meetings on April 28th, after your side presented your plan and our side presented our reasonable counter-proposal on May 2nd, your side has consistently adopted an attitude of refusing to negotiate, attempting to force our side to accept your unilateral and unreasonable plan, rendering any progress in the meetings impossible. Your side has proposed adopting the administrative meeting format in both the Fourth Agenda item staff meetings and delegation meetings, yet you have repeatedly adopted a non-negotiating attitude in the administrative meetings, causing the administrative meetings to only conceal the truth of the negotiations from the people of the world, without producing any beneficial effect. Our side has consistently believed that the solution to problems lies not in the form of the meeting, but in the sincerity to resolve the problem and the attitude of consultation. Regardless of the form of the meeting, problems can be resolved through consultation as long as there is sincerity to resolve them on a reasonable basis. Therefore, our side formally proposes ending the administrative meeting format and entering open delegation meetings from today onwards.

    On April 28th, your side presented a plan and claimed that your plan was a comprehensive solution to all unresolved issues. In fact, your plan cannot constitute a comprehensive solution to all unresolved issues. The only concession in your plan is that your side, on the issue of restricting airport facilities in Korea, withdrew your demand, which you should have withdrawn long ago, of interfering in our internal affairs. However, your side still insists on its baseless opposition to our nominations of neutral nations for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and still insists on your unilateral and unreasonable demand to detain over 100,000 of our captured personnel.

    The issue of restricting airport facilities is itself an issue completely unrelated to the armistice negotiations. Whether or not any facilities are constructed within Korea is entirely a matter of internal affairs and should not be brought up for discussion in the armistice negotiations. In order to remove all your excuses on this issue, our side has long agreed that during the armistice, neither side shall introduce any reinforcements of military forces from outside of Korea, and it is clearly stipulated that no reinforcing combat aircraft shall enter from outside of Korea. Your side no longer has any reason to insist on this demand to interfere in our internal affairs.

    On the issue of neutral nation nominations, our side's position is also absolutely reasonable. Our side has proposed three countries that fully meet the definition of neutral nations agreed upon by both sides, and our side suggests that both sides simultaneously and at once agree to all of the neutral nation nominations proposed by the other side, or that both sides nominate neutral nations without any agreement procedures. Your side has failed to provide any tenable reasons, nor can it provide any tenable reasons, to oppose any of the neutral nations nominated by our side. However, in order to achieve a comprehensive resolution of all remaining issues, and to quickly achieve a Korean armistice to satisfy the preliminary wishes of peace-loving people around the world, our side proposed a reasonable compromise counter-proposal on May 2nd. On the condition that your side abandon its demand to interfere in our internal affairs by restricting airport facilities, and accept our existing reasonable compromise proposal on the issue of prisoners of war, our side can agree to your side's proposal to form a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission composed of four neutral nations.

    On the issue of prisoner of war repatriation, in order to break the long-standing deadlock and resolve the issue on the basis of mutual concessions, our side made significant concessions to your side as early as March 21st and March 27th, and put forward our principles and adjusted plan regarding the repatriation of prisoners. On March 21st, our side suggested that the issue of handling the more than 44,000 of our captured personnel whom you illegally classified as detained civilians be set aside, and that the two sides determine the principle of unconditionally repatriating all prisoners of war held by each side, based on the list of prisoners of war exchanged on December 18, 1951. On March 27th, our side further suggested that both sides unconditionally repatriate all Korean prisoners of war and United Nations prisoners of war or Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who were originally from the other side; Korean prisoners of war whose original home is in the holding side and who wish to return home immediately after the armistice may not be repatriated. However, since your side began discussing the issue of prisoners of war on December 11th of last year, not only has your side not made any substantive concessions on the issue of prisoners of war, but on the contrary, after expressing its willingness to resolve the issue within the outline of our side's March 21st repatriation principle, and declaring that the number of 116,000 was the approximate total number of our captured personnel that your side would repatriate, it fundamentally overturned your own clear expressions and specific promises, continuing to insist on your unreasonable demand for so-called voluntary repatriation for all of our captured personnel, proposing a repatriation figure of 70,000, and arrogantly attempting to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel. When your side is only prepared to repatriate 70,000 of the 176,000 of our captured personnel held by your side, and attempts to detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel, our side is prepared to repatriate all 12,000 of your captured personnel held by our side. It must be clearly and unambiguously pointed out that your side's unilateral and unreasonable demands and arrogant attempts are absolutely unacceptable to our side under any circumstances. The so-called 'screening' that your side is conducting among our captured personnel is a complete violation of the Geneva Convention and is fundamentally illegal. The results claimed by your side based on this illegal screening are therefore completely invalid. In the plan of April 28th, the unilateral and unreasonable plan that your side once again put forward regarding the issue of prisoners of war only proves that your side is not concerned about the interests of your own captured personnel, and proves that your side is deliberately delaying and even sabotaging the armistice negotiations. Our side's repatriation principle of March 21st and the adjustment plan of March 27th have already made significant concessions to your side, and your side has no reason to refuse our side's reasonable compromise plan on the issue of prisoners of war. In our side's comprehensive plan of May 2nd, we made further significant concessions on the issue of neutral nation nominations, and your side has even less reason to refuse to accept our reasonable compromise-based comprehensive plan. However, since May 2nd, your side has consistently adopted an unreasonable and non-negotiating, arrogant attitude of attempting to force our side to accept your unilateral and unreasonable demands. Your side has repeatedly claimed that your plan is final, unchangeable, and must constitute the final agreement. Your side has even openly stated that your side will use more time to continue to adopt your arrogant and unreasonable attitude, clearly attempting to delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations. It must be pointed out again that the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will not be influenced by any arrogant and threatening attitude. The delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has consistently strived to achieve a Korean armistice as soon as possible, and has patiently negotiated with your side for this purpose, but will resolutely reject your side's unilateral and unreasonable demands in all meetings. In order for the meeting to progress, your side must withdraw your arrogant attitude of refusing to negotiate and reconsider your position. Our side has exhausted all efforts, and the next step of the armistice negotiations is entirely up to your side."

    美方阴谋用行政会议形式拖延并破坏谈判
    南日将军斥美方横蛮态度
    正式建议终止行政性会议进入公开谈判
    【新华社开城七日电】朝鲜停战谈判自四月二十八日进入代表团大会行政性会议后，我方在五月二日对于各项未决问题提出了合理折衷的全面方案。但对方自五月二日以来，始终采取了拒绝协商的横蛮态度，再次企图利用行政性会议的形式，进行蒙蔽欺骗世界人民的勾当。为使会议的真相大白于世人，彻底揭发对方片面无理的立场，我方在五月七日代表团大会上正式建议终止行政性会议的形式，进入公开谈判。我方首席代表南日将军发言全文如下：
    “四月二十八日你方建议召开代表团大会行政性会议，你方曾声称：你方认为行政性会议的形式最适合于全盘解决未决问题的目的。但自从四月二十八日进入行政性会议，你方提出你方方案，我方于五月二日提出我方的合理对案以来，你方始终采取了拒绝协商的态度，企图强使我方接受你方片面无理的方案，以致会议不可能有任何进展。你方先后在第四项议程参谋会议和代表团大会中提出采用行政性会议的形式，而你方却又在行政性会议上一再采取了不协商的态度，使行政性会议只是将谈判的真相从世界人民面前蒙蔽起来，而不能产生任何有益的作用。我方一贯认为问题的解决，不在于会议的形式，而在于解决问题的诚意和协商的态度，不论在任何会议的形式中，只要有在合理基础上解决问题的诚意都能协商解决问题。因此我方正式建议终止行政性会议的形式，从今天起进入公开代表团大会。
    四月二十八日你方提出方案并声称：你方方案是全盘解决所有未决问题的方案。事实上你方方案根本不能构成所有未决问题的全面解决方案。你方方案中唯一的让步，是你方在限制朝鲜境内机场设备的问题上，撤回你方早已应该撤回的干涉我方内政的要求，而你方仍然坚持对于我方所提出的参加中立国监察委员会的中立国提名的毫无理由的反对，仍然坚持你方企图扣留十万以上我方被俘人员的片面无理的主张。
    所谓限制机场设备的问题，本身就是一个与停战谈判完全无关的问题，朝鲜境内任何设备的修建与否完全属于内政问题，根本不应该在停战谈判的会议中提出讨论。为了解除你方在这一问题上的一切藉口，我方早已同意在停战期间双方不得自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的军事力量，并明确规定不得自朝鲜境外进入任何增援的作战飞机，你方早已没有任何理由坚持这一企图干涉我方内政的要求。
    在中立国提名问题上，我方的立场也是绝对合理的。我方提出了三个完全符合于双方协议的中立国定义的国家，我方并建议双方同时并一次同意对方所提出的全部中立国提名，或是双方各自提名中立国家而不进行任何同意手续。你方未能提出任何站得住的理由，也不可能提出任何站得住的理由来反对我方提名中的任何一个中立国家。但为了取得各项剩余问题的全盘解决，迅速达成朝鲜停战，以满足全世界爱好和平人民的初步愿望，我方在五月二日提出我方的合理折衷对案，在你方放弃限制机场设备的干涉我方内政的要求并接受我方对战俘问题的已有的合理折衷方案的条件下，我方可以同意你方提出的以四个中立国家组成中立国监察委员会的方案。
    在战俘遣返的问题上，为了打开长期的僵局，在互相让步的基础上解决问题，我方早在三月二十一日和三月二十七日向你方作了重大的让步，提出了我方关于被俘人员的遣俘原则和调整方案。我方在三月二十一日建议，同时将你方非法分类为被拘留平民的四万四千余名我方被俘人员的处理问题置于一边，双方以一九五一年十二月十八日交换的战俘名单为基础，确定双方无条件全部遣返其所收容的战俘的原则。我方在三月二十七日更建议双方无条件全部遣返其各自收容的所有原籍对方的朝鲜籍战俘和联合国军战俘或中国人民志愿军战俘；原籍在收容一方的朝鲜籍战俘愿在停战后立即回家者，可以不予遣返。但你方自去年十二月十一日开始讨论战俘问题以来，不但没有在战俘问题上作任何实质的让步，相反地，你方在表示愿在我方三月二十一日遣俘原则的轮廓内解决问题，并声明十一万六千的数字是你方遣返我方被俘人员的接近总数以后，根本推翻了你方自己的明确表示和具体诺言，继续坚持你方对我方被俘人员全体实行所谓自愿遣返的无理主张，提出七万遣俘概数，横暴企图扣留十万以上的我方被俘人员。当你方只准备遣返你方所收容的十七万六千名我方被俘人员中的七万名，而企图扣留十万以上我方被俘人员时，我方却准备全部遣返我方所收容的一万二千名你方被俘人员。必须清楚无误地指出，你方这种片面无理的主张和横暴的企图是在任何情况下我方所绝对不能考虑的。你方在我方被俘人员中所进行的所谓‘甄别’是完全违背日内瓦公约，是根本非法的。你方根据这种非法的甄别所声称的结果因而也是完全无效的。你方在四月二十八日方案中，对于战俘问题所再次提出的片面无理的方案，只是证明了你方毫不关心你方自己的被俘人员的利益，证明了你方蓄意拖延乃至破坏停战谈判。我方三月二十一日的遣俘原则和三月二十七日的调整方案，对于你方已经作了重大的让步，你方本已没有任何理由拒绝我方在战俘问题上的合理折衷方案。我方五月二日的全面方案中更在中立国提名问题上作了重大的让步，你方更没有任何理由拒绝接受我方的合理折衷的全面方案。但自五月二日以来，你方始终采取了不讲理、不协商，企图强使我方接受你方的片面无理主张的横蛮态度。你方一再声称：你方方案是最后的，不可更改的，必须构成最后的协议。你方甚至于公开声称：你方将使用更多的时间继续采取你方的横蛮不讲理的态度，显然企图拖延并破坏停战谈判。必须再次指出，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团将不为任何横蛮威胁的态度所影响，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团一贯争取早日达成朝鲜停战，并为此而耐心地与你方进行谈判，但将在一切的会议上断然拒绝你方片面无理的主张。为了会议的进展，你方必须撤回你方拒绝协商的横蛮态度，重新考虑你方的立场，我方已经竭尽了一切的努力，停战谈判的下一步完全在于你方。”
