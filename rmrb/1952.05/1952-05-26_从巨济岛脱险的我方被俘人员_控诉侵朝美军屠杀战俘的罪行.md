(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 25) The "People's Army News," published in Pyongyang, carried on the 22nd a public letter to all soldiers of the Korean People's Army written by three of our personnel who escaped from the US 76th POW camp on Geoje Island at the risk of their lives: Korean People's Army Sergeant Choi Song-ok, Private First Class Lee Hoon-shi, and soldier Yoon Chang-il (all transliterated). In their letter, they angrily accused the American aggressor bandits of bloody crimes of abusing, torturing, insulting, and massacring our captured personnel with the suffering they personally experienced and the facts they witnessed, and ruthlessly exposed the extremely hypocritical and shameless lies of the US negotiators regarding "voluntary repatriation" and "humanitarian principles." Below are the full texts of two public letters written by Choi Song-ok, Lee Hoon-shi, and Yoon Chang-il.

The full text of Choi Song-ok's letter is as follows:

Dear Comrades, Soldiers of the Korean People's Army:

When the Syngman Rhee bandit gang and the American imperialists invaded Korea, I volunteered to join our People's Army, wielding weapons and disregarding everything to fight with blood to defend our sacred territory.

In a certain battle, I was wounded and lost consciousness, and was dragged away by the American bandits to the US POW camp in the Busan area, and later transferred to Geoje Island.

The terror that I personally experienced on Geoje Island and that our brothers are still suffering there is truly indescribable. The American military's POW camp is a hell on earth filled with terror.

I escaped from the clutches of terror on May 7 and returned to the free motherland, feeling extremely happy. But when I think of our comrades still suffering indescribable hardships on Geoje Island, my heart is about to burst! Now I will talk about the situation in the US 76th POW camp.

The US 76th POW camp on Geoje Island is very humid and the air is foul. The living quarters are pitch black. There is nothing to lay on the ground. This POW camp has eighteen torture chambers and six so-called "steam rooms" (where American executioners use intolerably high temperatures to persecute our captured personnel to death). There are also four gallows used to slaughter and threaten our captured personnel.

American bandits treat prisoners of war like livestock. We are always underfed. But we are forced to do hard labor every day. Two meals a day, with meager food, usually millet porridge or sorghum porridge. We only get a meal of rice once a week.

American bandits not only torture prisoners of war, but also often starve them to death.

American bandits, like they did with other prisoners of war, forced me to write a blood letter on a "petition" to betray our motherland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But I did not give in, did not succumb to the American bandits, and was not deceived by the bandits.

In mid-April of this year, the following happened: On April 14th, Brigadier General Dodd, the US military camp commander, led a US colonel and three other officers to the POW camp, and had the prisoners of war gather to listen to Dodd's speech. The venue was surrounded by American guards. Dodd said: All prisoners of war should be re-registered uniformly. Each prisoner of war will be given a piece of paper to fill out and sign. He also said: The US military headquarters plans to release prisoners of war who "hope" to serve the United Nations forces, so prisoners of war need to sign anti-communist "petitions" with their own blood.

The meeting place immediately erupted with shouts of "Send us home! We don't want to work for the Americans!" and "Observe the Geneva Convention, we will not join the United Nations forces!" All prisoners of war clenched their fists and stood up!

Dodd immediately left the podium. At this time, American guards had surrounded us with machine guns and rifles. Dodd quickly hid, and the American bandits began shooting at the prisoners of war. Eighteen people were killed on the spot, and thirty-seven others were injured.

The next day, they interrogated the prisoners of war individually. I was also called in. A US colonel asked me if I knew which prisoners of war were members of the Labor Party, and asked for their names, and also asked who was the one who instigated the "riot." The US colonel said to me: "If you tell the truth, I will give you eight hundred US dollars and release you. Then you can go to Seoul and be a free man."

At that time, I stubbornly refused to answer this provocative question, citing international regulations that prisoners of war are not obliged to answer political questions. So they dragged me out of the interrogation room, pushed me into a pitch-black basement, stripped me naked, tied my hands, and whipped me with leather whips.

In the basement, there were also brothers who were being tortured in the same way as me.

I fainted several times. The bandits poured boiling water all over my body and continued to whip me. Finally, the American executioners escorted me to another basement and pushed me into an iron cage-like place, so that I could not even move.

The American bandits threatened me: "If you don't say who shouted communist slogans at the meeting yesterday, we will electrocute you."

I simply hated these foreign dogs' brutal crimes to the core, wishing I could eat them.

I resisted the torture with silence.

Later, I finally found an opportunity to escape from the POW camp, crossed the 38th parallel, and returned to the free motherland.

I will never forget the terror of the US POW camp on Geoje Island, and I will never be able to eliminate the deep hatred for the American bandits. I will dedicate everything I have, even my life, to resolutely drive the hateful foreign dogs out of our territory to avenge my hatred.

The full text of the letter co-written by Lee Hoon-shi and Yoon Chang-il is as follows:

We are extremely angry and hateful about the American and Rhee gangs' shameless trampling on all international laws and bloody suppression of our captured personnel on Geoje Island.

We escaped from the US POW camp on Geoje Island on May 4th and returned to the embrace of the free motherland. Now we are happily breathing the fresh air of freedom.

We want to accuse all kind people of the terrorist atrocities committed by the American butchers on Geoje Island. We ask the people of our country and the people of the world to unanimously support our brothers who are being tortured and trampled on by the US military on Geoje Island.

The American interventionists are committing extremely brutal crimes in the Geoje Island POW camp; the purpose is to force our captured personnel to serve as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee gang and the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and to force our captured personnel to be slaves of the Americans. For this purpose, the US military authorities on Geoje Island restarted the so-called "screening" in April. The American bandits fabricated so-called "petitions" and forced our captured personnel to affix blood fingerprints on them. Those who refused to do so would be subjected to inhumane torture and abuse. When the two of us refused to affix blood fingerprints on the so-called "petition," we were tortured. They押 pushed us into a dark basement, whipped and beat us with iron rods, pricked our fingers with needles, and even threatened to saw off our shoulders. They hung us up and branded our whole bodies with red-hot irons, pulled out our hair handful by handful, and threatened us with hanging and electrocution.

The suffering we endured is unimaginable. We thought our lives were sure to be buried in the hell of the American bandits. But we firmly believe that the American aggressor bandits will bear the responsibility for their sinful atrocities before the people of our country and all mankind.

After being tortured, we decided to find every possible way to escape from the POW camp.

We finally escaped by taking advantage of the opportunity to do forced labor outside the POW camp, and returned to the embrace of the free motherland.

All captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies are willing to return to their motherland as soon as possible. We believe that day will surely come soon.

The American bandits' plan to turn our captured personnel into American slaves and serve as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs is absolutely impossible to realize. The American bandits must bear the responsibility for the crimes they committed on Geoje Island.

Having returned to the embrace of the free motherland, we are determined to dedicate all our strength to severing the sinister hands of the despicable and shameless American bandits and the Syngman Rhee gang, resolutely defend our beloved motherland, and strive for complete victory.

Long live the glorious Korean Workers' Party!

Long live our beloved Republic government!

Long live our respected leader, General Kim Il-sung!

    从巨济岛脱险的我方被俘人员
    控诉侵朝美军屠杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】平壤出版的“人民军新闻”在二十二日刊载了冒死从巨济岛美方第七十六号战俘营逃出的我方被俘人员朝鲜人民军下士崔松玉、上等兵李勋时和战士尹昌一（均译音）三人写给朝鲜人民军全体战士的公开信。他们在信中以亲身经历的苦难和亲眼看到的事实，愤怒地控诉美国侵略强盗虐待、拷打、侮辱和屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行，无情地揭穿了美方谈判代表的所谓“自愿遣返”、“人道原则”等极端虚伪无耻的谎言。下面就是崔松玉、李勋时、尹昌一三人所写的两封公开信。
    崔松玉的信全文如下：亲爱的朝鲜人民军战士同志们：
    当李承晚匪帮和美帝国主义者侵入朝鲜的时候，我志愿参加了我们的人民军，手执武器不顾一切地进行了以鲜血保卫我们神圣疆土的斗争。
    在某次战斗中，我负伤后失去了知觉，被美国强盗们拉去送到釜山地区的美方俘虏营，后来又被移到巨济岛。
    我在巨济岛上所亲身经历过的和我们的弟兄们还在那里遭受着的恐怖，实在是无法形容的。美军的俘虏营是充满恐怖的人间地狱。
    我在五月七日从恐怖的魔掌中逃脱出来，回到自由的祖国大地，感到万分幸福。但当我想起我们的同志们仍在巨济岛上遭受难以形容的苦难时，我的心都要爆裂了！我现在谈一谈美军第七十六号俘虏营的情形。
    设在巨济岛上的美军第七十六号俘虏营非常潮湿，空气恶浊。住的地方漆黑一团。地上什么铺的东西也没有。这个俘虏营里有十八个拷问室和六个所谓“蒸气室”（美国刽子手们在这里用人类难以忍受的高温迫害我们被俘人员，使人致死）。另外还有用以屠杀和威胁我们被俘人员的四个绞刑台。
    美国强盗对待战俘就像对待牲口一样。我们一直是吃不饱的。但是每天都被迫做劳役。每天两顿饭，食物少得可怜，经常是小米粥或高粱米粥。一个星期只能吃到一顿大米饭。
    美国强盗们不但对战俘横施拷问，而且还常常使战俘饥饿致死。
    美国强盗们，像对待其他战俘一样，曾强迫我在背叛我们的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的“请愿书”上写血书。但是我没有气馁，没有向美国强盗屈服，没有受强盗们的欺骗。
    今年四月中旬发生过这样的事情：四月十四日这一天，美军俘虏营负责人杜德准将领着一个美军上校和另外三个军官来到俘虏营，让战俘们集合听杜德演说。会场被美国警备兵们包围起来。杜德说：全体战俘应该一律重新登记。发给每一个战俘以纸张，由战俘填写并签名。他又说：美军司令部打算释放“希望”为联合国军服务的战俘，因此需要战俘们用自己的血在反共的“请愿书”上签名。
    会场上立刻爆发了“把我们送回家去！我们不愿意为美国人卖命！”和“要遵守日内瓦公约，我们不参加联合国军！”的呼喊声。全体战俘都握紧拳头站起来了！
    杜德马上就下了讲台。这时美国警备兵们已用机枪和步枪包围了我们。杜德很快地躲避起来，美国强盗们就对战俘开始射击。当场死了十八个人，还有三十七个人负伤。
    第二天他们就对战俘进行了个别的审讯。我也被叫了去。一个美军上校问我知道不知道那一个战俘是劳动党员，并问及他们的名字，还问我谁是掀起“暴动”的人。那个美军上校对我说：“你如果把事实说出来，就给你八百美元，并把你释放出去。那你就可以到汉城去作一个自由民了。”
    当时我以战俘没有义务答复政治问题的国际法规为理由，顽强地拒绝了回答这一挑衅性的讯问。于是他们就把我从审讯室拉出去，推到一间漆黑的地下室里，剥光我的衣服，捆住我的两手，用皮鞭抽打我。
    在地下室里还有和我同样地受着拷打的弟兄们。
    我曾经好几度昏厥过去。强盗们又用滚烫的水浇我的全身，并继续抽打我。最后美国刽子手们把我押到另一个地下室里，把我推进了一个铁笼似的地方，使我连动也不能动。
    美国强盗们威胁我说：“你如果不说出昨天在会上喊共产主义口号的人是谁，就用电把你杀死。”
    我对这些洋狗们的残暴罪行，简直恨入骨髓，恨不得把他们吃掉。
    我用沉默抗拒了拷问。
    后来我终于找到机会逃出俘虏营，越过三八线回到了自由的祖国大地。
    我永远忘不了巨济岛美军俘虏营的恐怖，也永远消除不了对美国强盗的深切憎恨。我要献出我的一切以至我的生命，坚决把可恨的洋狗们驱逐出我国领土来报仇雪恨。
    李勋时和尹昌一合写的信全文如下：
    我们对美李匪帮无耻地蹂躏一切国际公法、血腥地镇压巨济岛上的我军被俘人员的暴行，万分愤怒和憎恨。
    我们在五月四日逃出巨济岛美军俘虏营，回到自由祖国的怀抱。现在我们快活地呼吸着自由的新鲜空气。
    我们要向一切善良的人们控诉美国屠夫们在巨济岛制造的恐怖暴行。我们要求我国人民和全世界人民一致声援在巨济岛上遭受美军拷打和蹂躏的我们的弟兄们。
    美国干涉者在巨济岛俘虏营制造残暴到极点的罪行；目的是要强迫我方被俘人员充当李承晚匪帮和蒋介石匪帮的炮灰，强迫我方被俘人员做美国人的奴隶。为了这个目的，巨济岛的美军当局在四月间再次开始了所谓“甄别”。美国强盗们捏造了所谓“请愿书”，强迫我们被俘人员在那上面加盖血指印。拒绝那样做的人就要遭受惨无人道的拷问和虐待。当我们两个人拒绝在所谓“请愿书”上加盖血指印的时候，我们就受到了拷问。他们把我们押到漆黑的地下室里，用皮鞭和铁棒抽打我们，用针刺我们的手指头，甚至威胁我们说要锯掉我们的两肩。他们把我们吊起来用烧红的铁条烙我们的全身，一把一把地拔我们的头发，并用绞刑和电刑威胁我们。
    我们所经受的苦难是难以想像的。我们以为我们的性命一定要葬送在美国强盗们的地狱里了。但是我们坚信美国侵略强盗必将在我国人民和全人类的面前担负其罪恶暴行的责任。
    受过拷问以后，我们就决定想尽一切办法逃出俘虏营。
    我们终于乘着到俘虏营外面做强迫劳役的机会逃脱出来，回到了自由祖国的怀抱。
    所有朝中人民军队的被俘人员都愿意早日回到自己的祖国。我们相信那个日子不久必将到来。
    美国强盗企图把我方被俘人员变成美国人的奴隶，并充当李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的炮灰的计划，是绝对不能实现的。美国强盗必须负起它在巨济岛制造的罪行的责任。
    回到自由的祖国怀抱的我们，决心献出自己的全部力量，斩断卑鄙无耻的美国强盗和李承晚匪帮的魔手，坚决保卫我们可爱的祖国，争取彻底的胜利。
    光荣的朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    我们亲爱的共和国政府万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁！
