    Henan Songwan District Cooperative Has Tax Evasion Phenomenon
    Leading Cadres Should Admit Mistakes and Humbly Self-Criticize
    Editor: The Songwan District Cooperative in Xichuan County, Henan Province, has tax evasion issues, but the cooperative's leading cadres are not humbly admitting their mistakes. According to a preliminary investigation, the cooperative evaded 140,000 yuan in stamp tax and 104,100 yuan in goods tax in the first quarter of 1952 alone, out of a turnover of 32,906,700 yuan.
    The reason why this cooperative dared to evade taxes is that the director of the cooperative ideologically neglected national tax laws. He thought that the front store was so busy that it was too troublesome to issue invoices for 5,000 yuan worth of goods and affix stamps for 15,000 yuan worth of goods. After this inspection, the director of the cooperative not only did not conduct a self-criticism but also said, "We are so busy, and you come to inspect us for three or four days." In reality, the relevant departments only inspected for two afternoons, and it was done with the cooperative's consent, utilizing their spare time. They are afraid of criticism, especially afraid of us submitting articles to the newspaper to criticize them, but they themselves are unwilling to admit their mistakes. We believe that in addition to paying the back taxes, the leading cadres of this cooperative should examine and correct their erroneous thinking.　Li Yucheng

    河南宋湾区合作社有漏税现象
    领导干部应承认错误虚心检讨
    编辑同志：河南淅川县宋湾区的合作社有漏税现象，而该社领导干部却不虚心承认错误。据初步检查，该社只在一九五二年第一季度的流水额三千二百九十万六千七百元中，就漏了印花税十四万元，货物税十万四千一百元。
    这个合作社所以敢于漏税，是因为该社主任在思想上忽视国家税收法令。他认为门市部那样忙，五千元的货要开货票，一万五千元的货要贴印花，实在太麻烦了。这次检查后，合作社主任不但不进行检讨，反而说：“我们这样忙，你们一来就检查了三、四天。”实际上有关部门只检查了两个下午，而且还是取得合作社的同意，利用他们空暇的时间来检查的。他们怕批评，尤其怕我们向报纸投稿批评他们，而他们自己却不愿承认错误。我们认为这个合作社除应补税外，该社领导干部并应检查纠正错误思想。　李玉成
