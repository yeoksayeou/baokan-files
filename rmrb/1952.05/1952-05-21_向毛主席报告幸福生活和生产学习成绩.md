To Chairman Mao, Report on Happy Life and Achievements in Production and Learning
People of the Huna League Directly Subordinate Organs and Hailar City
Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a Decision to Launch a Patriotic Movement to Increase Production and Livestock

Respected Chairman Mao: As we celebrate the great "May Day" International Labor Day, all the people of the Huna League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region extend to you our highest respects and warmest congratulations with immense excitement!

Today is a grand festival for working people all over the world to review their strength, and also the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Five years ago, under your wise leadership, the people of Inner Mongolia implemented national regional autonomy. After five years of construction, the people of Inner Mongolia have shaken off the threats of backwardness, poverty, disease, and decline, and are moving towards a bright road of freedom, happiness, and increasing strength. Flourishing scenes have emerged in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. A new relationship of equality, friendship, unity, mutual assistance, and common development has been established among all ethnic groups.

In 1951, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the Huna League achieved great success in resisting America and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and increasing production patriotically. This year, we have also carried out the anti-corruption, anti-embezzlement movement, cleansed the poisons left over from the old society, educated all the people and cadres, and consolidated the leadership of the working class. Therefore, new atmospheres have emerged in production and government work, making our confidence in building a better future even stronger. However, we also know that in order to realize our desire for peaceful construction, we must shatter the heinous conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a war of aggression. Recently, American imperialism has again inhumanely spread bacteria in Korea and parts of Northeast China, attempting to use germ warfare as a desperate struggle. We cannot tolerate this inhuman and barbaric crime of American imperialism. We will definitely do our best to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and defeat American imperialism as soon as possible. In addition, we have decided to launch a league-wide patriotic movement to increase production and livestock this year, increasing grain production by 10,000 tons in agricultural production, and increasing livestock by 150,000 head in animal husbandry.

This year, in commemorating "May Day" International Labor Day, all the people of the Huna League pledge to you: We will definitely respond to your great call with practical actions, and strive to fulfill the glorious mission of "increasing production and practicing economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers"! We wish you good health.

We Workers Can Now Study at Tsinghua University

Respected Chairman Mao: I am a student in the Tsinghua University Cadre Remedial Class. Today, I am able to study at Tsinghua University, and I am truly overjoyed. Everyone knows that before the War of Resistance, Tsinghua was a "preparatory class for studying in the United States." Most of the students studying here were young masters and misses from landlord and capitalist families. But today, it has changed. Here is a new atmosphere. Comrades from all aspects of the production front of the motherland are participating in learning here. This is only possible under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

After we arrived here, we received enthusiastic care from the students of Tsinghua University. The teachers who teach us are all volunteers. They solemnly swore to the motherland to guarantee the successful completion of the task. We ourselves have also made up our minds to learn well. We must use the spirit of revolution to overcome all difficulties.

Today, as the motherland is about to begin its great economic construction, we have the opportunity to study and master advanced technology in depth, so as to add new blood to the construction cause of the motherland. This is a glorious task. We must cherish this glorious task. In addition to studying hard, we must also bring the noble qualities and revolutionary spirit of the working class to Tsinghua, so that Tsinghua can truly become a university for the working people.

Zhang Sancai, a 76-year-old Worker

Thank Chairman Mao for Giving Workers a Good Life

Respected Chairman Mao: I am an old worker at the Suzhou Power Plant, and I have worked in the power plant's turbine workshop for more than 20 years. I am 76 years old this year and I am already enjoying retirement benefits. My life was very hard before liberation. Although I was old, I still had to work to survive, because if I didn't work for a day, I would starve for a day. Decades of life's torment often made me sick, and the capitalists often disliked me for being old and useless. I often thought, "Old people are worthless," and worried about the fate of my old life. After liberation, the People's Government promulgated the Labor Insurance Regulations. I was extremely happy and immediately put down the burden in my heart that I had been carrying for decades. I deeply realized that we workers have truly turned over. Last year, during the National Day parade, I sat in a car, and our mayor and the chairman of the trade union greeted me warmly. Many young workers and students applauded me enthusiastically. I was so touched! I have never been so happy in my life. Now, I have retired and receive more than 700,000 yuan in retirement pay every month. Things that I couldn't even imagine in the past have now come true. Because I am happy and my life is stable, my spirit is much better than before. You are truly the great savior of us workers, and I will never forget that these happy days were brought to us under your leadership. This is what I want to say to you from the bottom of my heart.

Launch a Competition to All Rural Busy Season Nurseries

Dear Chairman Mao: In order to respond to the great call to "increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," we convened a meeting of all nursery committee members and representatives of nannies and biological mothers on March 25th. We further rectified and developed the rural busy season nurseries, and adjusted the female labor force in the entire village so that women can better invest in agricultural production. Last year, there were few nurseries established, and they were not popularized throughout the village. This year, everyone unanimously requested to continue development. After a detailed investigation, there are a total of 125 children under the age of six in the village, and ten nurseries need to be established (four more than before), and 25 nannies are needed. We also specifically stipulated the equivalent system for biological mothers and nannies, and studied methods for supplying snacks and various toys to children. Everyone believes that the nursery's achievements last year were very significant, and holding a meeting of biological mothers and nannies once every half month is a very good method, as it can check shortcomings and exchange experiences. In order to consolidate and improve our work, we also revised the patriotic pact: (1) In order to realize the 1952 bumper harvest plan, each biological mother should eliminate all concerns, actively send their children to the nursery, save labor, and participate in agricultural labor as much as possible. (2) Each nanny must ensure that children do not have any accidents. (3) Pay attention to hygiene at all times, ensuring that each child's hands and face are clean, and washing their clothes once every seven days. (4) Nannies and biological mothers should pick up and drop off children on time. (5) Nannies and biological mothers must be equivalent, and neither should suffer losses. (6) Nannies should never use scolding, beating, or superstitious threats to educate children, but should adopt correct methods of persuasion and education. In addition, a plan for women to participate in agricultural labor has been formulated according to the season and the conditions of the village. In order to raise awareness and ensure the implementation of the plan, we ordered 21 copies of the Shanxi Peasant News, selected reading group leaders and study group leaders, and conduct collective studies every five days. We will use practical actions to thank you for your concern for us, increase production, cultivate the next generation, and more forcefully support the Volunteers, defeat the common enemy of all mankind—the American imperialist aggressors—and seek world peace as soon as possible. We will launch a patriotic friendship competition to all rural busy season nurseries across the country.

Promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method": Each Person Recognized More Than 1,000 Characters in Three Weeks

Respected Chairman Mao: We did not have the opportunity to study in the old society. The landlords always called us "roughnecks" and "idiots." After the liberation of the whole country, workers and peasants have turned over politically and economically, but their cultural improvement is still slow. Thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership, Comrade Qi Jianhua created the "Rapid Literacy Method," which is a good way to help comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds learn culture. Since receiving the news that our platoon was designated as the key experimental unit for the "Rapid Literacy Method," everyone has felt extremely happy. We have invested in the cultural learning movement in a tense and combative posture.

In the three weeks of study, we have achieved great results. Before learning, the A-level comrades recognized an average of only about 1,000 characters per person, but now each person can recognize more than 2,300 characters. They can now read general books and newspapers and write simple letters and articles. Before learning, the B-level comrades recognized an average of only about 100 characters per person, but now they generally recognize about 2,000 characters. Comrade Qi Baochi only recognized the two characters "military" after studying for three years in the past, but now, after nineteen days of study, he has recognized more than 1,600 characters. We are now reading a large number of popular readings. We feel that our eyes have been brightened. Although we have already recognized more than 2,000 characters, we are not satisfied with these achievements. We must continue to study hard and improve our cultural level in order to master modern weapons and strike at the American imperialists!

Yanjing University Students During the "Three-Anti" Movement

Thoroughly Eliminated the Ideological Influence of American Imperialism

Respected Chairman Mao: We report to you our gains in the "Three-Anti" movement with excitement and gratitude.

Before the "Three-Anti" movement, in our school, there were still remnants of imperialist forces wearing the masks of "academic freedom" and "religious freedom," continuing to spread ideological poisons. The government's educational policies could not be well implemented, and there were still many dark corners in the school. At that time, some students still worshiped the material civilization of American imperialism, some students did not care about the country and the people, and even wanted to be "fish in the lake, birds in the sky." Over the past three years, with the rapid progress of the motherland in all aspects, although we have also made a lot of progress, we have never completely shaken off the ideological influence of American imperialism.

After the start of the "Three-Anti" movement, all teachers, students, and staff of the school joined this great struggle for ideological transformation, thoroughly eliminating the remnants of American imperialism in Yanjing University and shaking off the ideological enslavement that American imperialism had imposed on us for many years.

We have further drawn a clear line with the bourgeoisie and deeply realized that only the ideology of the working class can guide the people of the motherland to socialism, and only labor is the source of happiness for the motherland and ourselves. We are determined to be laborers with a communist worldview.

The ideological influence of imperialism has been eliminated, and the red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is flying in our sky; the decadent worldview has been overthrown, and the revolutionary worldview has begun to be established; we are filled with the joy of rebirth. We deeply feel that it is extremely happy to live in the era illuminated by your brilliance. The important tasks that you and the motherland have given us become the driving force for us to move forward in every second. We know that every step we take forward is the result of your and the beloved Party's teaching. Of course, we will never be proud and complacent about the victories we have already won. For a better tomorrow for the motherland, all the students of Yanjing University solemnly swear to you: We must be ready at all times; as long as you, dear Chairman Mao, issue a call, we will immediately go to the forefront of defending peace and building the motherland!

    向毛主席报告幸福生活和生产学习成绩
    呼纳盟直属机关及海拉尔市人民
    庆祝内蒙自治区成立五周年决定开展爱国丰产增畜运动
    敬爱的毛主席：当庆祝伟大的“五一”国际劳动节的时候，我们内蒙古自治区呼纳盟全体人民，以万分兴奋的心情，向您致以崇高的敬礼和热烈的祝贺！
    今天是全世界劳动人民检阅自己力量的盛大节日，也是内蒙古自治区人民政府成立五周年的纪念日。五年前内蒙人民在您英明的领导下，实行了民族区域自治。经过了五年建设的内蒙古人民，已经摆脱了落后、贫困、疾病和衰亡的威胁，走向了自由幸福的日益健旺的光明道路，在政治、经济、文化各方面都呈现出欣欣向荣的景象。各民族之间建立了平等、友爱、团结、互助和共同发展的新关系。
    一九五一年，呼纳盟全体人民，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在抗美援朝、镇压反革命、爱国丰产等方面都获得了很大成绩。今年我们又进行了反贪污、反盗窃的运动，清洗了旧社会遗留下来的污毒、教育了全体人民和干部，巩固了工人阶级的领导权，因此在生产和机关工作中都展现了新的气象，使得我们对建设美好未来的信心更加坚定。但是，我们也知道，要想实现我们和平建设的愿望，必须粉碎美国帝国主义发动侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。最近美帝国主义又灭绝人性地在朝鲜、在我国东北部分地区撒布细菌，企图用细菌战作垂死挣扎，我们对美帝国主义这种惨无人道的野蛮罪行是不能容忍的，我们一定尽全力支持中国人民志愿军，早日打垮美帝国主义。此外，我们在今年决定开展一个全盟范围的爱国丰产增畜运动，在农业生产上增产一万吨粮食，在牧业方面要增加十五万头牲畜。
    今年纪念“五一”国际劳动节，我们呼纳盟全体人民向您提出保证：一定用实际行动积极响应您的伟大号召：为完成“增加生产、厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的光荣使命而奋斗！敬祝您的身体健康

    我们工人今天能到清华大学学习了
    敬爱的毛主席：我是清华大学干部补习班的学员。今天，我能够来到清华大学学习，真有说不出的高兴。谁都知道，抗战前清华是“留美的预备班”，在这里读书的大多是地主和资本家的少爷小姐们。可是，今天却变了。这里是一片新的气象。来自祖国各方面生产战线上的同志们在这里参加学习了。这只有在毛主席和共产党的领导下才是可能的。
    我们来到这里后，得到清华大学同学们热情的照顾，给我们上课的先生，都是志愿任教的。他们庄严地向祖国宣誓，保证胜利完成任务。我们自己也下了决心，一定要学会学好。我们要用革命的精神去克服一切困难。
    在祖国就要开始伟大的经济建设的今天，我们能有机会深入学习和掌握高级技术，以便为祖国的建设事业增加新血液，这是一个光荣的任务。我们一定要珍视这个光荣任务，除了努力学习以外，更要把工人阶级的高贵品质和革命的精神带到清华来，使清华真正变成一个工农大众的大学。

    七十六岁的老工人张三才
    感谢毛主席给工人的好日子
    敬爱的毛主席：我是苏州电厂的老年工人，在电厂汽机工场工作了二十多年。我今年七十六岁，已经享受退休的待遇了。解放前我的生活很苦，虽然年纪大，为了活命，还是得干活。因为如果一天不干活，就一天挨饿。几十年来生活的折磨使我常常生病，资本家常嫌我年老不中用。我常常想：“人老珠黄不值钱”，担心着自己老命的归宿。解放后，人民政府颁布了劳动保险条例。我快活极了，一下就放下了几十年的心里的重担；我深切体会到我们工人真的翻了身了。去年国庆节大游行时，我坐在车上，我们的市长和工会主席亲热地招呼我，许多青年工人和学生热烈地向我鼓掌。我太感动了！我活了这么大的年纪，从没有这样高兴过。现在，我已经养老退休，每月领取七十多万元的退休金。过去想也想不到的事，而今天竟实现了。因为心境愉快，生活安定，我的精神比前好多了。您真是我们工人的大救星，我永远忘不了这些幸福的日子是您领导我们得来的。这就是我心里要向您说的话。
                  苏州电厂老工人　张三才山西屯留西故县村农忙托儿所
    向全国农忙托儿所发起竞赛
    亲爱的毛主席：我们为了响应“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召，在三月二十五日召开了全体托儿委员及各个单位的褓姆、生母代表会，进一步整顿与发展了农忙托儿所，调整了全村的女劳动力，以便妇女更好地投入农业生产。去年托儿所成立的少，没有普及到全村。今年大家一致要求继续发展。经过详细调查，全村六岁以下的小孩共一百二十五个，需要成立十个托儿所（比以前增加四个），褓姆要二十五人。我们并具体规定了生母、褓姆的等价制度，研究了供给小孩的零食及各种玩具的办法。大家认为托儿所去年的成绩是十分显著的，半个月召开一次生母、褓姆会是很好的方法，既能检查缺点，又能交流经验。为了巩固和提高我们的工作，我们并修订了爱国公约：（一）为实现一九五二年的丰产计划，每个生母取消一切顾虑，积极送孩子入托儿所，节省劳力，尽量参加农业劳动。（二）每个褓姆要保证孩子不出意外的事故。（三）经常注意卫生，要做到每个小孩手脸干净，每隔七天给小孩洗衣服一次。（四）褓姆与生母按时接送小孩。（五）褓姆、生母必须等价，两不吃亏。（六）褓姆教育小孩决不用打骂和迷信威胁办法，要采取正确的说服教育的方法。此外，并按季节结合本村情况，订出妇女参加农业劳动计划。为了提高觉悟，保证实现计划，我们订了二十一份山西农民报，选出读报组长和学习组长，每五天集体学习一次。我们要拿实际行动感谢你对我们的关怀，增加生产，培养后代，以更有力地支援志愿军，打败全人类的公敌——美帝国主义侵略者，求得世界早日和平。我们要向全国所有的农忙托儿所掀起爱国主义的友谊竞赛。
        山西屯留县西故县村农忙托儿所全体委员、褓姆、生母
    推行“速成识字法”三周内每人认识了一千多字
    敬爱的毛主席：我们在旧社会里得不到学习的机会，地主总叫我们“老粗”、“笨蛋”。全国解放以后，工人、农民在政治上、经济上都翻了身，但在文化上提高还较慢。由于毛主席的英明领导，祁建华同志创造了“速成识字法”，这是帮助我们工农出身的同志学习文化的一种好方法。我们自从接到以我们这一排作“速成识字法”重点试验的消息后，大家都感到无比的愉快。我们紧张地以战斗的姿态投入了文化学习运动。
    在三周的学习时间里，我们获得了很大的成绩。甲级的同志在学习以前，平均每人只认得一千字左右，现在每人都能认识两千三百字以上。他们已经能够阅读一般书报，写简单的信件和文章了。乙级的同志在学习以前，平均每人只认得一百字左右，现在一般都认识两千字左右了。齐保池同志过去学习了三年，只认得“军人”两字，现在经过十九天的学习，已认识了一千六百多个字。现在我们正大量地阅读通俗读物。我们觉得我们的眼睛都亮起来了。我们虽然已经认识了两千多字，但是我们决不满足于这些成绩，我们一定继续努力学习，提高文化水平，以求掌握现代化的武器，打击美帝国主义者！　某部某排全体人员
    燕京大学全体学生在“三反”中
    清算了美帝国主义的思想影响
    敬爱的毛主席：我们满怀着兴奋和感激的心情，向您报告我们在“三反”运动中的收获。
    “三反”运动前，在我们学校里，还有帝国主义残余势力披着“学术自由”、“宗教自由”的假面具，继续散布思想毒素。人民政府的文教政策，不能很好贯彻执行，学校里还存在着很多阴暗的角落。那时，有些同学还崇拜美帝国主义的物质文明，有些同学还不关心国家和人民，甚至想做“湖中的鱼，天上的鸟”。三年来随着祖国在各方面的飞速进展，我们虽然也有了不少的进步，但始终未能完全摆脱美帝国主义思想的影响。
    “三反”运动开始后，全校师生员工一起投入到这个伟大的思想改造的斗争中去，彻底清算了美帝国主义在燕京大学的残余势力，摆脱了多年来美帝国主义对我们在思想上的奴役。
    我们又进一步划清了和资产阶级的界线，深刻地认识到只有工人阶级思想才能引导祖国人民走向社会主义，只有劳动才是祖国和我们自己幸福的泉源。我们立志要做一个具有共产主义人生观的劳动者。
    帝国主义的思想影响被肃清了，马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的红旗飘扬在我们的上空；颓废的人生观被打倒了，革命的人生观开始树立了起来；我们充满了新生的喜悦。我们深刻地感到，生活在您的光辉照耀的时代，是无比幸福的。您和祖国给予我们的重大任务，在每一秒中都成为鼓舞我们前进的力量。我们知道，我们每前进一步，都是您和亲爱的党教导的结果。当然，我们决不为已有的胜利而骄傲自满。为了祖国更美好的明天，我们全燕京大学学生向您庄严宣誓：我们一定随时准备好；只要您，亲爱的毛主席发出号召，我们就立即走上保卫和平和建设祖国的最前线！　燕京大学全体学生
