    Promote Rural Nurseries to Allow Mothers to Work and Produce with Peace of Mind
    Editor: In order to welcome the agricultural bumper harvest movement, it is absolutely necessary to open rural seasonal nurseries in a planned and systematic manner. This allows women with children to put their labor into production, allowing them to work and produce with peace of mind. Therefore, I suggest that the production leading organs and maternal and child care departments of each county vigorously open rural nurseries according to the specific conditions of each place, and that the county women's federations hold short-term training classes for rural nursery caregivers to train childcare workers and better promote the work of rural seasonal nurseries.　Wang Yu

    推广农村托儿所让母亲们安心劳动生产
    编辑同志：为了迎接农业丰产运动，在农村中有计划有步骤地开办农忙托儿所是完全必要的。这可使有孩子的妇女把劳动力投到生产上去，让她们安心劳动生产。因此我建议各县的生产领导机关和妇婴保育部门，根据各地的具体情况，大力开办农村托儿所，并由县民主妇女联合会举办农村托儿所保育员短期训练班，培养保育工作人员，更好地推广农忙托儿所的工作。　汪预
