    Our Country's Increased Flue-Cured Tobacco Production Begins to Be Exported
    Our country's first batch of flue-cured tobacco for export began to be exported in April of this year. This is the result of the people's government's correct implementation of the policy of developing industrial raw material production.
    Flue-cured tobacco is the main raw material for manufacturing cigarettes. Our country has been planting flue-cured tobacco leaves for nearly forty years. Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Sichuan, Guizhou, Northeast, Shanxi, Zhejiang and other places have all grown it. In the past, under the devastation of American and British imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, the output was far from meeting the needs, and cigarette factories relied on the import of American flue-cured tobacco for a long time. From 1905 to 1949, the import amount of American tobacco reached 830 million US dollars. At the same time, the number of cigarette imports was also very large. The import volume of American cigarettes in July 1946 was approximately equal to one-quarter of the total output of all cigarette factories in Shanghai at that time. If we add the smuggled imports of cigarettes organized by American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, the number would be even more staggering. The large-scale intrusion of American imperialist tobacco leaves and finished products bankrupted the economy of China's tobacco producing areas and closed down many cigarette factories. In 1945, the planting area of tobacco fields in Shandong decreased by 50.93 percent compared with 1936, and the output decreased by 47.9 percent. In 1946, two-thirds of the eighty-odd cigarette factories in Shanghai were forced to shut down, and the few that could operate mostly relied on American raw materials for manufacturing.
    After liberation, the people's government resolutely stopped the import of foreign cigarettes in 1950. In order to ensure the supply of raw materials for the domestic cigarette industry, it adopted the policy of developing flue-cured tobacco production. In 1950, the method of fully utilizing sun-cured tobacco and flue-cured tobacco in combination for production was adopted, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient flue-cured tobacco production and ensuring the supply of raw materials for cigarette production. In 1951, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, in the "Decision on Agricultural and Forestry Production in 1951," determined to increase the national flue-cured tobacco leaf production by 324.8 percent on the basis of 1950. The Central People's Government also stipulated the tobacco-grain price ratio, and some regions signed "guaranteed price" and "guaranteed sales" contracts with tobacco farmers, dispelling farmers' concerns about market, price, and other issues; local Party and government leading organs helped farmers solve problems such as seeds and fertilizers, and carried out pre-purchase work; moreover, due to the patriotic production increase campaigns carried out in various places, tobacco farmers' production enthusiasm was improved, and they enthusiastically responded to the call of the people's government, processing, fertilizing, overcoming natural disasters, and achieving a bumper harvest of flue-cured tobacco last year. Last year's flue-cured tobacco production increased by 340 percent compared with 1950, and exceeded the highest record in the history of flue-cured tobacco production in our country. Because last year's flue-cured tobacco production increased more than planned, it not only fully meets the needs of domestic cigarette industry raw materials, but also enables our country to become a country capable of exporting flue-cured tobacco from 1952, changing from a country with insufficient flue-cured tobacco. In the trade agreements signed between the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries in 1952, flue-cured tobacco has become one of our country's important export commodities. Our country's flue-cured tobacco is of excellent quality and reasonable price, and has been widely welcomed by various countries. Our country's first batch of flue-cured tobacco for export began to be exported in April of this year.
    The task of flue-cured tobacco production this year is to further increase the yield per unit area on the basis of developing production last year, and especially to improve the quality grade, so that the domestic cigarette industry can obtain a sufficient supply of high-quality flue-cured tobacco, and to further increase the export quantity of flue-cured tobacco in 1953.

### 我国烤烟产量增加开始向国外输出

    我国烤烟产量增加开始向国外输出
    我国第一批外销烤烟，已在今年四月开始出口。这是人民政府正确贯彻发展工业原料生产方针的结果。
    烤烟是制造卷烟的主要原料，我国种植烤烟叶已将近四十年，山东、河南、安徽、四川、贵州、东北、山西、浙江等地都有种植。过去在美英帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的摧残下，产量距离需要很远，卷烟厂卷烟原料长期依赖美国烤烟输入。从一九零五年到一九四九年，美烟进口金额即达美金八亿三千万元。同时，卷烟输入数量也很大。一九四六年七月份的美国卷烟进口量约等于当时上海全部烟厂生产总量的四分之一。如果再加上美帝国主义和国民党匪帮组织的走私进口烟，其数量就更惊人。美帝国主义大量烟叶和成品的侵入，使我国产烟区的经济破产，许多卷烟工厂倒闭。一九四五年山东烟田种植面积比一九三六年减少百分之五十点九三，产量减低百分之四十七点九。一九四六年上海全市八十几家烟厂被迫停工的有三分之二，几家能开工的也多是依靠美国原料制造的。
    解放后，人民政府于一九五零年坚决停止了国外纸烟的进口，为了保证国内卷烟工业原料的供应，采取了发展烤烟生产的方针。一九五零年采取了充分利用晒烟和烤烟搭配生产的办法，克服了烤烟生产不足的困难，保证了卷烟生产的原料供应。一九五一年中央人民政府政务院在“关于一九五一年农林生产的决定”中，确定在一九五零年的基础上，全国增产烤烟叶百分之三百二十四点八。中央人民政府还规定了烟粮比价，有的地区和烟农订了“保价”“保销”合同，解除了农民对市场、价格等问题的顾虑；各地党政领导机关帮助农民解决了种籽、肥料等问题，开展了预购工作；更由于各地开展爱国丰产运动，烟农生产情绪提高，热烈响应人民政府的号召，加工，施肥，战胜自然灾害，取得了去年烤烟生产的丰收。去年烤烟产量较一九五零年增加百分之三百四十，并超过了我国烤烟生产历史上的最高纪录。由于去年烤烟增产超过计划，不但能充分供应国内卷烟工业原料的需要，并使我国自一九五二年起，从烤烟不足的国家变成了能输出烤烟的国家。在一九五二年中央人民政府贸易部和苏联及新民主主义国家订立的贸易议定书上，烤烟已成为我国重要的出口物资之一。我国烤烟的品质优越，价格合理，已受到各国的广泛欢迎。我国的第一批外销烤烟，已在今年四月开始出口。
    今年烤烟生产的任务，是要在去年发展生产的基础上，进一步提高单位面积产量，特别要提高品级，使国内的卷烟工业，能够获得充分的优良烤烟的供应，并使一九五三年的烤烟出口数量能够更加增大。（乔冀民）
