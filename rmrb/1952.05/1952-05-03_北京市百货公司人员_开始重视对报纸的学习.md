    Personnel of Beijing Department Stores
    Begin to Value Studying Newspapers
    Comrade Editor: The Beijing Department Store has accepted the criticisms from readers of the People's Daily and has begun to value newspaper reading. Since April 1st, personnel from the secretariat and the general affairs section have enthusiastically participated in newspaper reading and study.

    In the past, everyone always emphasized being busy with work and not having time to read the newspaper. However, the recent situation of newspaper reading and study has proven that the reason many comrades did not read the newspaper in the past was not because they truly did not have time, but because they did not value newspaper reading in their thinking. Now that everyone values newspaper reading and study, they have also made better use of their time. The general affairs section sets aside one hour at noon for reading the newspaper, and the secretariat sets aside one hour every evening for study.

    After this period of study, many comrades deeply realized that studying the newspaper is of great help to their own progress, and their enthusiasm for studying the newspaper is even higher. For example, Comrade Zhang Chunfang from the kitchen actively takes the time to participate in newspaper reading and study, and can even actively offer opinions after listening to others read the newspaper. Comrade Wang Zhongping, a typist in the secretariat, was sick once during newspaper reading time, and his comrades could not persuade him to go home and rest.

    Some electricians and ironworkers, who in the past were not very concerned about politics and believed that as long as they completed their work tasks, they were serving the people. Now they have also joined in newspaper reading and study, and realize that without improving their political awareness and ideological level, they cannot serve the people well.

    In order to further promote everyone's political and current affairs study, the comrades unanimously requested that the leadership continue to strengthen leadership over newspaper reading. Lie

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市百货公司人员
    开始重视对报纸的学习
    编辑同志：北京市百货公司接受人民日报读者的批评，开始重视读报工作。从四月一日起，秘书科和总务科的人员热烈地参加读报学习。
    以往，大家总是强调工作忙，没有时间读报。但最近读报学习的情况证明：很多同志过去不读报的原因并不是真没有时间，而是思想上不重视读报工作。现在大家重视了读报学习，也就抓紧了时间。总务科在中午抽出一个小时读报，秘书科每晚抽出一个小时学习。
    经过这一段时间的学习，很多同志深深体会到学习报纸对自己的进步有很大帮助，学习报纸的热情更高了。如伙房张春芳同志积极抽时间参加读报学习，在听别人读报后还能主动提出意见。秘书科打字员王中平同志有一次在读报时间内病了，同志们劝他回家休息都劝不回去。
    有些电工、铁工技术人员，过去对政治很不关心，认为只要完成自己的工作任务就是为人民服务。现在他们也参加了读报学习，认识了不提高自己的政治觉悟和思想水平，是不能很好地为人民服务的。
    为了进一步推动大家的政治时事学习，同志们一致要求领导方面对读报工作继续加强领导。烈
