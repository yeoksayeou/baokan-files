Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th. On the 8th, our chief liaison officer, Zhang Chunshan, notified the U.S. chief liaison officer, Kenney, during a meeting, that U.S. military aircraft had continuously bombed and strafed our Changcheng prisoner-of-war camp on May 4th and 5th, and called this to the U.S. side's serious attention. At around 10:00 AM on the 4th, a U.S. military aircraft strafed and bombed our Changcheng prisoner-of-war camp. On the 5th, U.S. military aircraft strafed the vicinity of the Changcheng prisoner-of-war camp twice with four planes. Colonel Zhang pointed out: "For your illegal actions of disregarding the safety of your own captured personnel and violating the Geneva Convention, your side must bear all the consequences arising therefrom." Kenney promised to "investigate."

The American aggressors have not only consistently treated our captured personnel with brutal abuse, insult, and collective slaughter, but also disregard the safety of their own captured personnel, repeatedly strafing our POW camps, which are marked clearly. This is a vivid portrayal of what Ridgway's so-called statement of May 7th, which attempted to deceive the people of the world, referred to as the U.S. proposal of April 28th being "based on humanitarian principles." From the U.S. side's repeated bombing and strafing of its own captured personnel, completely disregarding their lives and safety, one cannot help but understand more clearly the brutal essence of the so-called "voluntary repatriation" that the U.S. side insists on.

Since the opening of the delegation representatives' conference on April 28, the U.S. side has used a unilateral so-called "overall solution to existing problems" proposal as a seal, closing the door to continued negotiations between the two sides on a reasonable basis and in a spirit of consultation. In essence, it also sealed the lips of the U.S. representatives led by Joye. After eight days of meetings, the U.S. side has refused to negotiate, refused to reason, and has even been so arrogant as to say that apart from accepting their proposal, no "debate or counter-proposal" can be made. The reason why the U.S. side is unwilling to discuss is that the "voluntary repatriation" and "humanitarian principles" and other such goods manufactured and peddled by the American aggressors have already become notorious and have long been overturned by the actual actions taken by the U.S. side against our captured personnel and their own captured personnel, and cannot withstand any discussion at all. Therefore, they simply act unreasonably, refuse to negotiate, and attempt to delay and undermine the negotiations. This attitude is absolutely intolerable to the people of Korea and China and the people of the world.

    我方联络官通知美方严重注意
    美机连续轰炸扫射我昌城战俘营
    美方这种非法行为完全暴露其“自愿遣返”的残暴实质
    【新华社开城九日电】八日我方首席联络官张春山在与美方首席联络官肯尼举行会议中，通知美方五月四日和五日两天内，美方军用飞机连续轰炸、扫射我方昌城俘虏营，并提起美方严重注意。四日下午十时左右，美方军用飞机一架对我方昌城俘虏营进行扫射和投弹。五日，美方军用飞机两次四架在昌城战俘营附近进行扫射。张上校指出：“对于你方这种不顾你方自己被俘人员的安全、破坏日内瓦公约的非法行为，你方必须担负由此而产生的一切后果的责任”。肯尼答应“进行调查”。
    美国侵略者不仅一贯对待我方被俘人员进行残暴虐待、侮辱和集体屠杀，而且也不顾他们自己被俘人员的安全，一再扫射我方设置显明标志的战俘营。这就是李奇微五月七日那篇企图蒙蔽世界人民的所谓声明中所指的美方四月二十八日的方案是什么以“人道原则为基础的”活生生的写照。人们从美方对自己的被俘人员这种一再轰炸扫射，丝毫不顾及他们的生命和安全的行为来看美方所坚持的“自愿遣返”，就不能不更清楚地了解所谓“自愿遣返”的残暴的实质。
    自四月二十八日双方代表团代表大会开会以来，美方以片面的所谓“现存问题的全盘解决”方案作为封条，封闭了双方在合理的基础上以协商的态度继续进行谈判的门户。实质上也封闭了以乔埃为首的美方代表们的嘴唇。开了八天大会，美方既拒绝协商，又拒绝说理，甚至蛮横到说什么除了接受他们的提案外，是不能作任何的“辩论或提出对案”的。美方之所以不愿讨论，就是因为美国侵略者制造与贩卖的“自愿遣返”与“人道原则”等类货色已经是臭名远扬，早已为美方对我方被俘人员及对他们自己被俘人员所采取的实际行动所推翻，根本经不起任何讨论，因此，干脆就蛮不讲理，拒绝商谈，希图以此来拖延并破坏谈判。这种态度是朝中人民和世界人民所绝不能容许的。
