Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: The new Indonesian Prime Minister Wilopo has expressed dissatisfaction with the enslaving trade policy pursued by U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia. According to an Indonesian dispatch in the Paris weekly "Action," entitled "U.S. Trade Policy Causes Dissatisfaction," Wilopo, in a formal statement, considered the U.S. trade policy to be discriminatory and a violation of the national interests of Asian countries. Wilopo was referring to the United Nations decision, passed under U.S. pressure, regarding the embargo against China.

The dispatch said: Wilopo also called attention to the U.S. Battle Act, according to which the U.S. government can suspend aid to any country that exports strategic materials to Eastern Europe and China. Wilopo said that due to this measure, the foreign trade of those countries has shrunk. Indonesia, as a recipient of U.S. aid, is forced to export its goods to Western Europe and the United States at inappropriate prices, and therefore, in recent years, Indonesia's trade balance has always been in deficit.

Wilopo further said: The United States is attempting to conclude a so-called "free trade" agreement with Indonesia. The United States and the Philippines concluded such an agreement in 1946. The Philippine Industrial Association has been striving to abolish this agreement for several years without success. As a result of this agreement, the Philippines annually loses 60 million U.S. dollars in tariffs previously collected on imports from the United States.

In answering the question about expanding Indonesia's trade opportunities, Wilopo said that this problem can be solved by concluding mutually beneficial trade agreements with all countries.

In addition, according to a TASS dispatch from The Hague on April 26, the new Indonesian Foreign Minister Mukarto, in response to questions from reporters at the airport in Amsterdam, Netherlands, also said: Indonesia's interests require expanding economic relations with the Soviet Union, New China, and other countries.

According to the Indonesian Antara News Agency, Wilopo and Mukarto have both expressed opposition to the U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan signed in San Francisco.

### 印尼新总理和外交部长  不满美国奴役性贸易政策

    不满美国奴役性贸易政策
    【新华社八日讯】印尼新任总理韦洛坡对于美帝国主义在东南亚推行的奴役性贸易政策表示不满。据塔斯社引巴黎“行动”周刊登载的一篇题为“美国贸易政策引起不满”的印尼通讯说：韦洛坡在发表正式谈话时，认为美国贸易政策是歧视并违反亚洲各国民族利益的一种贸易政策。韦洛坡指的是联合国在美国的压迫之下所通过的关于对中国禁运的决定。
    该通讯说：韦洛坡并且唤起大家注意美国的巴特尔法案，根据那个法案，美国政府可以对任何一个以战略原料输往东欧和中国去的国家停止援助。韦洛坡说，由于这种措施，那些国家的对外贸易已经萎缩。印尼既是一个接受美援的国家，就被迫把本国出口货按照不适当的价格输往西欧和美国，因此近几年来印尼的贸易差额总是入超。
    韦洛坡又说：美国企图和印尼缔结一种所谓“自由贸易”协定。一九四六年美国和菲律宾已缔结了这么一种协定，菲律宾工业协会好几年来力求废止这个协定而始终无效，由于这种协定的结果，菲律宾每年丧失了以往征收来自美国的进口货的关税而获得的六千万美元。
    韦洛坡在回答关于扩展印尼贸易机会的问题时说，这个问题可以凭借和一切国家缔结互惠的贸易协定而获得解决。
    另据塔斯社海牙四月二十六日电，印尼新任外交部长慕加多在荷兰阿姆斯特丹的机场上回答记者提出的问题时也说：印尼的利益要求和苏联、新中国及其他各国扩大经济关系。
    据印尼安打拉通讯社消息，韦洛坡和慕加多过去都曾表示反对在旧金山签订的美制单独对日“和约”。
