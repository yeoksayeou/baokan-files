    The second year of the Huai River harnessing project is now entering a tense stage. By the end of April, the spring Huai River projects in Henan, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu provinces had completed approximately 70 million cubic meters of earthwork, accounting for more than half of the spring project. Currently, the Banqiao Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Ru River in Henan Province has been completed. The Bai Sha Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Ying River, the earth dam has been closed. The dredging projects of dozens of tributaries of the Huai River in Henan Province and northern Anhui Province are being rushed. The earthwork project of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal in the lower reaches of the Huai River has been completed; the Gaoliangjian Water Diversion Sluice and the Yun (River) East Water Diversion Sluice on the irrigation canal are pouring concrete. The Gaoliangjian Water Diversion Sluice has completed 60%.

    This spring, on the Huai River control construction site extending over a thousand kilometers from Henan to northern Jiangsu, after the patriotic labor emulation campaign was universally launched, more than two million migrant workers overcame difficulties such as spring rain and accumulated water with a combat posture, and rushed to carry out various scheduled tasks. At the construction sites of the Banqiao Reservoir and the Bai Sha Reservoir in Henan Province, and the Xiacaowan Ridge Cutting Project in northern Anhui, the migrant workers worked around the clock in shifts. At present, the earth dam of the Bai Sha Reservoir is adding 50,000 cubic meters of earth every day. After the spring projects in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu started, spring snow and spring rain repeatedly hindered construction, but the migrant workers always maintained high morale and persisted in their work. When the Gaoliangjian Water Diversion Sluice in northern Jiangsu was pouring the foundation for the sluice gate, workers Li Laiqing and Lu Jincai actively came up with ways to improve the operation method of mixing concrete, so that the working efficiency of the mixer was increased from 17 pans of concrete per hour to 27 pans, and finally to 34 pans, so that the sluice gate foundation project could be completed ahead of schedule. In order to do a good job in night lighting on the Henan Banqiao Reservoir construction site, so that the migrant workers could work in shifts to make a breakthrough, the electrical workers set up lines during the day and were on duty at night, and challenged the migrant workers on the entire construction site to ensure that "where there are migrant workers, the lights will be lit." On the construction site of the Foziling Reservoir in northern Anhui, the workers of the hoisting team could only drive three steel sheet piles per pile driver per day, but in the labor emulation, the workers studied meticulous division of labor and paid attention to preparing work before pile driving. Now they can drive 15 piles a day, and the work efficiency has increased five times. More than 100,000 migrant workers who are repairing the diversion project of the main and tributaries of the Huai River in northern Anhui, after learning the advanced excavation and soil carrying methods of the labor model Zhu Huai Shun's migrant workers team, the soil efficiency has also been significantly improved.

    At present, the patriotic labor emulation campaign of the migrant workers on the Huai River control construction site is still in full swing. They wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting that: We guarantee that the spring Huai River project must be completed successfully before the summer flood season arrives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Workers and farmers in Hubei and Hunan provinces actively support the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. In order to ensure the completion of the flood diversion area's flood intake gate and control gate before the flood season, workers in factories in major cities in Wuhan and Hunan provinces bravely accepted the arduous task of assembling 20-plus-ton steel plates into more than 100 kinds of parts for automatic gate. When workers at the Jiang'an Bridge Factory in Wuhan were rushing to produce the first batch of gate, they worked continuously day and night in shifts, and automatically worked overtime on Sundays. The Changsha Railway Works of the Yuehan Railway originally scheduled to deliver five sets of gates on May 5, but the workers of the factory overcame various difficulties and manufactured seven sets of gates five days ahead of schedule. Around the "May 1st" Labor Day, all the workers of the Jianghan Shipyard No. 1 launched a patriotic labor emulation campaign to support the Jingjiang Flood Diversion, and automatically worked overtime even on "May 1st"; on May 3, they successfully completed the task of manufacturing the second batch of flood diversion gates.

    Transportation and supply has always been an arduous task in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. The people of Hunan and Hubei provinces have made great contributions to this front. On the second day of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, more than 4,200 boatmen from the Hubei Provincial Civil Ship Joint Transportation Cooperative participated in the transportation, driving more than 800 civil ships loaded with materials upstream along the river. In order to supply the hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians on the construction site with food in time, some people in Hunan Province are rushing to transport rice and grain from thousands of miles away to the construction site. The Temporary Command of the Changde Special Region led the migrant workers to mobilize more than 500 tons of ships in a short period of time, and built a new highway, so that a large number of bamboo, wood, rice straw, and firewood could be transported to the construction site by both water and land routes.

    Now is the busy season for spring plowing and rice transplanting in the Yangtze River Basin. The vast number of farmers in Hunan and Hubei provinces have launched large-scale mutual assistance in production to help the families of the tens of thousands of migrant workers participating in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. The Public Security Bureau of Hubei Province specifically discussed the issue of "not delaying both flood diversion project and spring plowing production" at the production representative meeting of the whole county. After the meeting, labor mutual aid organizations were widely organized in various townships and villages to help the families of migrant workers with farming. They also wrote letters of condolences to the construction site, and launched mutual competition for repairing embankments and increasing production. In late April, farmers in the fourth district of Changde County, Hunan, also donated a large amount of tobacco leaves, pickles, hot peppers, tea, fermented soybeans, bacon, and dried duck, and sent representatives to the construction site to express their condolences.

    The people close to the Jingjiang Flood Diversion construction site are even more caring for the vast number of soldiers and civilians. Many women in Ouchi Town, Shishou County, voluntarily went to the embankment to wash clothes and collect tools for the soldiers and civilians who were repairing the embankment. Many residents in Shashi voluntarily vacated their houses for the migrant workers to live in. The trade departments in the towns near the construction site have set up many daily necessities supply stations on the construction site; the postal and telecommunications departments have set up mobile service stations on the construction site; the Xinhua Bookstore has also set up a cultural service station on the construction site to serve the soldiers and civilians on the construction site.

    第二年度治淮春季工程进入紧张阶段
    湖南湖北人民积极支援荆江分洪工程
    第二年度治淮春季工程现正进入紧张阶段。到四月底止，河南、皖北、苏北三省区的春季治淮工程共作土方约七千万公方，已完成春季工程的半数以上。现在，河南省汝河上游的板桥水库已经修成。颍河上游的白沙水库，拦河土坝已将合龙。河南省和皖北区的数十条淮河支流的整理疏浚工程都在加紧赶修。淮河下游的苏北灌溉总渠土方工程已全部完工；灌溉渠上的高良涧进水闸和运（河）东分水闸都在浇灌混凝土，高良涧进水闸已完成百分之六十。
    今春河南到苏北一千多公里的治淮工地上，普遍展开爱国主义劳动竞赛后，二百多万民工们都以战斗姿态排除了春雨和积水等困难，突击进行各项预定的任务。河南省的板桥水库、白沙水库和皖北的下草湾切岭工程等处工地上，民工们都夜以继日地轮班赶工。目前白沙水库的拦河土坝每天上土达五万公方。皖北、苏北今春工程开工以后，春雪、春雨多次阻扰施工，但民工们始终情绪饱满地坚持了工作。苏北高良涧进水闸在浇灌混凝土的闸基时，工人李来清和陆金才积极想办法改进了拌和混凝土的操作方法，使拌和机的工作效率由原来每小时出混凝土十七盘提高到了二十七盘，最后提高到了三十四盘，因而使闸基工程得以提早完成。河南板桥水库工地上的电机工人为了做好夜间照明工作，使民工得以轮班突击，他们白天架线，夜间值班，并向全工地上的民工挑战，保证做到“那里有了民工，电灯就亮到那里”。皖北佛子岭水库工地上，起重队的工人本来每天一架打桩机只能打三块钢板桩，但工人们在劳动竞赛中，研究细密分工，打桩前注意做好准备工作，现在每天能打十五块，工作效率提高了五倍。修皖北淮河干支流分流工程的十多万民工，学习了劳动模范祝怀顺民工小队的先进挖土法和抬土法后，土工效率也显著提高了。
    目前，治淮工地上民工们的爱国主义劳动竞赛还在热火朝天地开展，他们写信向毛主席报告说：我们保证治淮春季工程一定要在夏汛到来以前胜利完成。    （新华社）
    湖北、湖南两省工人、农民积极支援荆江分洪工程。武汉市和湖南省各大城市工厂的工人，为了保证在汛期前修成分洪区的进洪闸和节制闸，都勇敢地接受了把二十多吨重的钢板，装成一百多种配件的自动闸门的艰巨任务。武汉市江岸桥梁厂工人在赶制第一批闸门时，日夜轮班连续工作，星期天还自动加班。粤汉铁路长沙工务修配厂，原订在五月五日首先交出五套闸门，可是该厂工人却排除了各种困难，提前五天制成七套闸门。“五一”劳动节前后江汉船舶一厂，全体工人展开了支援荆江分洪的爱国主义劳动竞赛，连“五一”节那天都自动加班；五月三日他们便胜利地完成了制造第二批分洪闸门的任务。
    运输供应工作一直是荆江分洪工程中的一项艰巨任务。湖南、湖北两省人民在这道战线上贡献了巨大的力量。湖北省民船联运社的船工，在荆江分洪工程动工的次日，就有四千二百多人参加运输，驾驶着满载物资的八百多艘民船，沿江而上。湖南省人民为了及时地供应工地上数十万军工、民工的草粮，有的在从千里之外向工地赶运米粮。常德专区临时指挥部领导民工，在短期内调集了五百多吨船只，又新筑起一条公路，使大批的竹、木、稻草、烧柴，可以从水、陆两路兼程向工地赶运。
    现在正是长江流域春耕插秧的农忙季节。湖南、湖北两省广大农民展开生产大互助，帮助参加荆江分洪工程的十数万民工家属生产。湖北省公安县在全县的生产代表会上，曾专门讨论了“分洪工程和春耕生产两不误”的问题。会后各乡、村都广泛组织起劳动互助组织，帮助民工家属代耕。他们并纷纷向工地写慰问信，发起修堤和增产的相互竞赛。湖南常德县四区农民在四月下旬还捐献了大宗烟叶、腌菜、辣子、茶叶、酱豆和腊肉、干鸭等，派代表带赴工地慰问。
    紧靠荆江分洪工地的人民，更是无微不至地关怀着广大军工、民工。石首县藕池镇好多妇女主动上堤为修堤军工、民工洗衣服和收管工具。沙市很多居民都自动腾出房子给民工住宿。工地附近各城镇贸易部门，都在工地上设了许多日用百货供应站；邮电部门在工地上设了流动服务站；新华书店也在工地上设立了文化服务站，为工地上军工、民工服务。
