    (16) The crops are almost ripe, and the village evaluation team comes to the fields to inspect them. As soon as they see the millet of Li Si's small mutual aid team, they all say in unison: "These crops are growing so well, they'll be number one in our village!"
    (17) The evaluation team goes to Wang Quanbao's field and sees that the millet is uneven in height, and turnips have been planted in the places where seedlings are missing. Someone says with a smile: "You see, the crops of individual households can't compete with those of mutual aid teams after all."
    (18) In autumn, the people of Wangjia Village are busy with the autumn harvest. Li Si's small mutual aid team finishes harvesting the millet and then harvests the corn. Some cut, some carry, everyone cooperates and works very hard.

    （十六）庄稼快成熟了，村上的评比组到田里来参观。一看到李四小互助组的谷子，都异口同声地说：“这庄稼长得真好，咱村要数第一啦！”
    （十七）评比组到王全保的地里一看，只见谷子七高八低，缺苗的地方还补种了蔓菁。有人笑着说：“你们看吧，单干户的庄稼到底赛不过互助组。”
    （十八）秋天，王家庄的人们都忙着秋收。李四小互助组收罢谷子收玉茭，割的割，搬的搬，大家分工合作，干得挺起劲。
