Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The full text of American POW Inach's supplementary confession regarding germ warfare is as follows:

    On January 1, 1952, at 14:00 hours, approximately ninety people were present during the dissemination of mission orders—pilots, navigators, bombardiers, radar bombardiers, mechanics, and machine gunners, all scheduled to fly that night. On this occasion, Battalion Adjutant Captain Gilbert Gale, in a casual reminder, instructed us to pay attention to non-exploding bombs (which we knew to be germ bombs). This was the first time I heard such an order passed down.
    On the nights of January 6 and January 10, when Captain William Armes and I reported to the Battalion Operations Section before a mission and were secretly told that we were to drop germ bombs, only the two of us and the Battalion Operations Section Captain giving us the order were in the room. Sometimes, two or three aircrew teams reported at the same time before taking off, but only Armes and I secretly received the order; the others waited outside the room.
    On the nights of January 6 and January 10, as Captain Armes, Sergeant Quixie, and I walked towards the plane, a guard from the ordnance department stood there, telling us not to approach the bombs (germ bombs) on the wings. This was not standard practice. Because during normal missions, no guards were stationed beside the plane.
    When carrying two germ bombs, they were hung on the outer wing pylons. When carrying four germ bombs, they were divided between the inner and outer wing pylons. If carrying more, they had to be placed in the bomb bay. In my experience, this is standard operating procedure (S.O.P.) because on January 6, we placed two germ bombs on the outer wing pylons, while the two inner wing pylons and the six pylons in the bomb bay held explosive bombs. On January 10, four germ bombs were placed on the wing pylons, while six explosive bombs were placed on the pylons in the bomb bay.
    Battalion Operations Section Adjutant Captain Gilbert Gale is approximately thirty years old, with black hair, about five feet eight inches tall, and weighs approximately one hundred eighty pounds. He is a rather burly man.
    The weather was clear on both nights we dropped germ bombs (the night of January 6 and the night of January 10). On the night of January 6, there were a few clouds, but this did not affect our mission.
    The person in the Battalion Operations Section who gave us (Captain Armes and me) the order to drop germ bombs on the nights of January 6 and January 10 was named Captain Robert Stewart. He is young, approximately twenty-five years old, with light-colored hair, about five feet eight inches tall, and weighs around one hundred sixty pounds.

    美国战俘伊纳克关于细菌战的补充口供
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国战俘伊纳克关于细菌战的补充口供，全文如下：
    一九五二年一月一日十四点钟，在接受传达任务的命令时，大约有九十人在场—驾驶员，领航员，轰炸手，雷达短程轰炸手，机械士，和机枪手，都是预定在那天晚上飞行的。这次，大队传令官吉伯特·加莱上尉以顺便提醒的方式，命令我们注意不爆炸的炸弹（我们知道这就是细菌弹）。这是我第一次听到传下这样的一个命令。
    在一月六日和一月十日的晚上，当我和威廉·阿麦斯上尉在执行任务前，向大队作战科报到，并被秘密地告诉了我们要去投掷细菌弹的时候，房间里只有我们两个人和向我们传达命令的大队作战科的上尉，有时，有两个或者三个机员小组在起飞前于同一时间到此地报到，但是只有阿麦斯和我秘密地接受命令，别的人都在房间外面等着。
    在一月六日和一月十日两晚，当我和阿麦斯上尉，屈西中士走向飞机时，有一个军械处派来的警卫站在那儿，要我们不要走近机翼上炸弹（细菌弹），通常的作法不是这样的。因为在执行正常的任务时，飞机旁边并不设警卫。
    在携带两枚细菌弹的时候，它们是挂在翼外的弹架上的。带四个细菌弹的时候，是分挂在机翼内外的弹架上的。如果带更多的话，必须放置在弹舱中。根据我的经验，这是标准的作业程序（S·O·P·）因为在一月六日我们把两枚细菌弹放在翼外的弹架上，而翼内的两个弹架和弹舱中的六个弹架都挂着爆炸的炸弹。在一月十日四枚细菌弹放在机翼的弹架上，而六枚爆炸的炸弹都放在弹舱里的弹架上。
    大队作战科传令官吉伯特·加莱上尉大约有三十岁，黑发，约高五英尺八英寸，体重约一百八十磅，是一个相当魁伟的人。
    我们两次投细菌弹的晚上（一月六日夜晚和一月十日夜晚），气象的情况是晴朗的。在一月六日的晚上，有一点云彩，但这并不影响我们的任务。
    在一月六日和一月十日两晚给我们（阿麦斯上尉和我）命令，叫我们去投细菌弹大队作战科的那个人，名叫罗伯特·史第华上尉，他很年轻，大约二十五岁，浅色的头发，约高五英尺八英寸，体重一百六十磅左右。
