(Reported by this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: People all over the world continue to angrily protest against the towering crime of US imperialism in waging germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China.

The Vietnamese people, at many rallies and meetings held in various places, resolutely condemned the towering crimes of the US aggressors. Ji Jishan, Chairman of the Hanoi Branch of the Vietnam National United Front, said at a rally: The people of Hanoi, who have been brutally oppressed by the French colonialists and US interventionists and have risen up against terror and enslavement, wholeheartedly support the people of Korea and China. Many counties in Vietnam have held mass rallies and passed resolutions protesting against the crimes of the US imperialists. Those that passed such resolutions include: the joint meeting of all people's organizations, lawyers, doctors, religious circles, and representatives of social celebrities and intellectuals in Central Vietnam, the conference of professors and educators in South Vietnam, and the representative conference of the twelve united sects of the Cao Đài religion in South Vietnam.

In India, fifty social celebrities from the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, including the Prime Minister of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union, Lale Wala, government ministers, lawyers, doctors, elders, and businessmen, as well as twenty-five members of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union Legislative Assembly who have already signed a statement denouncing the US military's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, also participated in the movement to protest against the US military's germ warfare. Thirty thousand citizens of Calcutta passed a resolution on May 3 during the May Day rally held under the auspices of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress and the United Trade Union Congress, resolutely condemning the US military's indiscriminate bombing and germ warfare in Korea, and demanding that those who committed such crimes be treated as war criminals. The women's conference in Chinsura City, Hooghly District, West Bengal, and the preparatory committee of the Women's Self-Defense League Conference in Howrah District, West Bengal, both denounced the US germ warfare. The Bombay India-China Friendship Association is conducting a signature campaign against germ warfare and held a mass rally against germ warfare in Naapoo Garden on May 3.

In Pakistan, about two hundred social celebrities in Karachi, including journalists, professors, and writers, signed the Karachi Peace Committee's declaration against the US imperialists' germ warfare in Korea. The declaration demanded that those who use poisonous gas and bacteriological weapons be tried as war criminals.

The Thai Peace Committee has sent letters to members of Congress and foreign diplomatic envoys in Thailand, condemning the US use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and protesting against the crimes of the Americans there. The letter stated that the Thai defenders of peace stand in solidarity with the Chinese and Korean people. In its letter to the members of Congress, the Thai Peace Committee urged them to urge the government to withdraw the Thai troops in Korea and stop following the warmongers.

The Soviet Embassy in France has received letters from organizations of people in twenty-four provinces of France who suffered from the Second World War. These letters said: "We are extremely indignant to learn that American aircraft have spread plague and cholera bacteria in Korea and China. ... We know the terrible suffering that our husbands and sons endured in fascist concentration camps and prisons, and we know what means of mass destruction of mankind were used during that period. Therefore, we cannot but feel indignant at the fact that the same means, which are condemned by the whole world, are now being used. We are deeply grateful to your government for advocating in the United Nations the prohibition of mass destruction means such as atomic bombs, bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons and other weapons."

The movement of the Brazilian people to protest against the use of bacteriological weapons by the US aggressors is gradually expanding. Scientist Fabio published an article in the "People's Daily" fiercely condemning the criminal acts of the US imperialists. He said, I protest against this heinous crime as a scientist. Irrefutable evidence shows that mankind is facing a serious threat. He continued: "Bacteriological weapons must be banned. The US and Brazilian governments must ratify the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition and condemnation of the use of such weapons." According to "World News", Lima, the director of a medical research institute, also condemned the US use of bacteriological weapons. Leaders of a number of student groups in San Salvador sent a telegram to the UN Secretariat, protesting against the US use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, and demanding that the United Nations take measures against these terrible crimes. Peace committees and progressive groups in many places have also protested against the shocking atrocities of the US aggressors. Brazilian patriots, regardless of arrest and persecution, distributed leaflets everywhere, condemning the atrocities of the US imperialists in using bacteriological weapons.

The Uruguay National Peace Committee held a meeting in Montevideo to discuss issues related to strengthening the struggle for peace. A resolution was passed at the meeting condemning the US aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people. The meeting called on the Uruguayan government to sign the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, and to advocate in the United Nations that all countries ratify this protocol.

    严厉谴责美帝国主义进行细菌战
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：全世界人民继续愤怒地抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    越南人民在各地举行的许多集会和会议上，都坚决斥责美国侵略者的滔天罪行。越南国民联合战线河内分会主席团继善在一次集会上说：受到法国殖民者和美国干涉者的残酷压迫、并已奋起反对恐怖和奴役行为的河内人民，全心全意地声援朝鲜和中国人民。越南的许多县都举行了群众集会，通过抗议美帝国主义者的罪行的决议。通过了这种决议的有：中越的所有人民团体、律师、医生、宗教界、以及社会名流和知识分子的代表会议，南越的教授和教育工作者会议，南越高台教的十二个联合教派代表会议等。
    在印度，巴地阿拉东旁遮普土邦联盟的社会名流五十人，其中包括巴地阿拉东旁遮普土邦联盟的总理莱尔沃拉和政府部长、律师、医生、耆老、商人，和已在痛斥美军在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的声明上签名的巴地阿拉东旁遮普土邦联盟立法会议议员二十五人，也参加了抗议美军进行细菌战的运动。加尔各答市民三万人五月三日在孟加拉省工会大会和统一工会大会的主持下举行五一节大会时通过决议，坚决谴责美国军队在朝鲜滥施轰炸和进行细菌战，并要求把那些犯了这种罪行的人当作战犯看待。西孟加拉省霍治里区钦素拉城妇女会议和西孟加拉豪拉区妇女自卫联盟大会筹备委员会，都痛斥美国进行细菌战。孟买印中友好协会正在进行反细菌战的签名运动，并于五月三日在纳浦花园举行反细菌战的群众大会。
    在巴基斯坦，喀喇蚩社会名流约两百人，包括记者、教授和作家，在喀喇蚩和平委员会反对美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行细菌战的宣言上签了名。宣言要求把那些使用毒气和细菌武器的人当作战犯审判。
    泰国和平委员会已分函国会议员们和各国驻泰国的外交使节，谴责美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器并抗议美国人在那里的罪行。信上表示泰国保卫和平的斗士和中国人民与朝鲜人民团结一致。泰国和平委员会在给议员们的信上，敦促他们促使政府撤回在朝鲜的泰国部队并不再追随战争贩子。
    苏联驻法大使馆收到法国二十四个省份中曾受第二次世界大战之害的人民所组织的团体的来信。这些信说：“我们获悉美国飞机在朝鲜和中国撒布鼠疫、霍乱的细菌后极感愤慨。……我们知道我们的丈夫和儿子在法西斯的集中营和监狱里所受到的可怕痛苦，我们知道在那个时期里曾经使用过什么大规模毁灭人类的手段，因此，我们对于现在使用为全世界所谴责的同样手段这一事实，不能不感到愤慨。我们深深地感激贵国政府在联合国主张禁止像原子弹、细菌武器、化学武器及其它武器这样的大规模毁灭的手段。”
    巴西人民抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的运动正在逐渐扩大。科学家费比奥在“人民报”上发表文章，激烈地谴责美帝国主义者的罪恶行为。他说，我以一个科学家的身份对这种滔天的罪行表示抗议。无可辩驳的证据表明：人类正在受到严重的威胁。他继续说：“细菌武器必须加以禁止。美国和巴西政府必须批准关于禁止和谴责使用这种武器的日内瓦议定书。”据“世界报”消息，某医学研究所所长利马也谴责美国人使用细菌武器的行为。圣萨尔瓦多一批学生团体的领袖致电联合国秘书处，抗议美国在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，并要求联合国对这些可怖的罪行采取措施。许多地方的和平委员会和进步团体也都对美国侵略者的惊人暴行表示抗议。巴西爱国者不顾逮捕和迫害，到处散发传单，谴责美帝国主义者使用细菌武器的暴行。
    乌拉圭全国和平委员会在蒙得维的亚举行会议，讨论了有关加强争取和平斗争的问题。会上通过了一项决议，谴责美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国人民使用细菌武器。会议要求乌拉圭政府签署禁止细菌武器的日内瓦议定书，并在联合国内主张各国批准这个议定书。
