"Challenge the whole country, and never fall behind!" The Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative, encouraged by its members, victoriously completed its spring planting competition plan.

In early April, the spring snow had just melted, and the roads were frozen solid in the mornings and evenings, while muddy at noon. At this time, they began delivering manure. On the six large pieces of dark brown land, neat rows of black manure piles were arranged. After delivering the manure, they used rubber-wheeled carts to haul black soil to the fields in order to improve the soil. In late April, when the frozen soil had not completely thawed, and there was still standing water in the low-lying areas, the new farm implement group began to work on plowing the upland fields. With thorough preparations, the spring planting work of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative began on May 10th.

**Tense Planting Work**

The Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative was very busy during the spring planting. At the second cockcrow, when the sky was about to dawn (around four o'clock), the bell rang in the village, and the members all got up. Groups of male and female members gathered together, sorting out ropes and discussing the day's work. After breakfast, around five o'clock, the day's labor began. In those days, standing at the village entrance, one could see: on the land to the south, the spring breeze blew, and yellow dust was constantly raised behind the seeders. The women's group, wearing white towels on their heads, was busy raking the ridges. They pointed to the new farm implement group that was sowing seeds and said, "We must surpass them!" According to the challenge conditions they proposed, they had to meticulously remove the soil from each ridge. They raked all the several hectares of ridge land in the whole cooperative clean. Under the verdant foothills, in the sunny fields, we could also see a tense labor scene. On the hills, three old plows were sowing seeds. On the flat land, two seeders moved quickly; three rubber-wheeled carts continued to haul black soil to the fields. In order to complete the spring plowing competition plan, they seized every minute to fight against nature. On May 18th, on a morning after a rain, the low-lying areas were too wet to plant, so the members sowed seeds in the upland fields. Three or four days after the sowing was completed, we met Chi Dianwen, the deputy director of the cooperative, and Niu Defang, the head of the agricultural group, on the road between the rice paddies; they were squatting on the edge of the field measuring the distance of the emerging seedlings and checking the soil moisture. They said: "There is enough moisture here. If it gets dry again, we plan to compress it again." Now, protecting the seedlings has become their central task. They scientifically calculated the distance between the seedlings, ensuring that each hectare of corn would have 36,000 seedlings. They said that this was their guarantee for harvesting 18 *shi* of grain per hectare of cornfield.

**Achievements in Spring Planting**

On May 20th, the cooperative victoriously concluded the spring planting work. In the evening, the members celebrated the victory of the planting and summarized the spring planting work at the same time. This year's planting period was shortened. In the past, it took 15 days, but this year it only took 10 days. The application of fertilizer also exceeded the original plan. During the spring planting, the rubber-wheeled carts continued to haul soil and manure to the fields, completing the plan to improve 15 hectares of land. More than 50 carts of sand were hauled into half a hectare of paddy field, and 42 hectares of dry land were generally covered with full manure, averaging 45 large carts (2,000 *jin* per cart) per hectare, an increase of 15 carts compared to previous years and 5 carts more than the original plan. In addition to the base fertilizer, various quick-acting fertilizers were also added. The corn seeds on 12 hectares of land were mixed with butter and wood ash. Another two hectares of high-yield land (corn, millet) were given 10 more carts of manure. When applying fertilizer, the principle of applying different fertilizers to different soils and different crops was followed. Yellow manure was applied to low-lying areas and cornfields, and pig manure was applied to soybean fields. After testing, it was found that the soil on the South Mountain was more acidic and needed to be fertilized with ash; now the whole cooperative has prepared 500 *jin* of ash fertilizer, and 3,000 *jin* can be prepared before summer weeding. In order to prevent spring drought, before sowing, the flat-planted (without ridges) farmland was harrowed several times (only once in previous years), and after sowing, it was all pressed with a roller; the high-planted (with ridges) farmland was also pressed with a roller after planting. The land using new farm implements was deeply plowed to seven inches (one inch deeper than in previous years), achieving plowing and harrowing at the same time. The rows planted with new farm implements were generally even in width, and the seedlings emerged neatly. The seedlings planted with old farm implements were denser, with four or five corn plants per cluster and four clusters per square meter; thirty soybean plants per square meter. These achievements would have been difficult to achieve before the formation of the production cooperative.

**Benefits of Unified Land Use**

In the spring planting process, the agricultural production cooperative showed its superiority. The cooperative unified the use of land and broke the boundaries. In the past, 25 hectares of land were scattered into more than 40 small plots; now, they have been connected into six large pieces according to the terrain, increasing the cultivated area by 1.5 hectares. In the past, one family planted corn and another family planted soybeans, which could not give full play to the effectiveness of new farm implements. Before planting every day, the remaining seeds from the previous day had to be cleaned out of the seeders. In the past, it was also impossible to give full play to the land's fertility. Gao Fengming's 1.6 hectares of land were most suitable for planting soybeans, but in order to eat, he had to plant eight or nine *mu* of corn every year. Now all six large pieces of land in the cooperative are planted with uniform crops: a large piece of soybeans in the South Mountain, a large piece of millet in the southeast, and a large piece of corn in the west of the river. In addition, they are now able to carry out land processing work. Through soil improvement, clay soil has been basically transformed into loam, and yellow soil has been transformed into fertile soil; they are gradually changing the uneven land into flat land.

**Rational Use of Labor**

The organization and division of labor has become more rational than before. Now, the division of labor is based on specialties, and the division of labor is more detailed, achieving rational use of labor. Rope maker Li Xingjun is responsible for making rope sets; carpenter Yu He is responsible for repairing farm implements and making horse yokes; old Fangtou, who has been raising horses for many years, is exclusively responsible for feeding horses; seed-dotting experts Chi Dianwu and others specialize in dotting seeds; old farmers Han Yi and Niu Defang manage and use old plows; Cui Hai, who has learned how to use new farm implements, manages and uses new farm implements. They each specialize in one area, give play to their specialties, and constantly improve labor efficiency. In the past, everyone was busy with their own work, and people with rubber-wheeled carts even wanted to go out and do odd jobs during the busy farming season, delaying the spring planting work. It was difficult to get the work done. In the past, difficulties often arose when allocating labor. For example, if Gao Wenku was allocated two and a half laborers, he would not want them, because this would mean making an extra person's meal, but they would do very little work. This time, unified allocation of labor overcame these difficulties. They also preliminarily set work quotas; four workdays for raking one hectare of land, and new farm implements plow more than half a hectare of land a day on average. The cooperative concentrated feeding of horses, overcoming the phenomenon of "pulling in eight directions with one intestine" in the past. Someone rings the bell in the morning, so everyone can sleep peacefully. Because large areas of land are planted with the same crops, the use of labor is more rational. In general, labor efficiency has improved a lot during spring planting. In the past, a new-style plow with two people and two horses could plow four *mu* of land a day, but this year it can plow half a hectare of land; in the past, a seeder with three people and two horses could plant 2.5 hectares of land a day, but this year it can plant four hectares of land. During the entire spring planting period, a total of about 200 workdays were saved. Most of the labor saved was used for intensive cultivation, soil improvement, and accumulating and transporting manure, and more than 20 surplus laborers were drawn to plant trees on 1.3 hectares of land in seven days. In the past, mutual aid teams saved labor to engage in sideline occupations, which somewhat neglected agriculture; this deviation has now been corrected.

**Public Funds Effectively Used in Production**

In the past, mutual aid teams could not find a way out for their public funds. They were deposited in banks by cadres or placed in other villages, and were not used to expand reproduction, failing to play their due role. Many team members expressed dissatisfaction with this. Now, the cooperative unifies the management of funds and uses them for credit, expanding reproduction, and developing animal husbandry. This year, there were insufficient livestock during spring planting, so 8 million yuan was used to buy four head of livestock, and two more draft cattle were recently purchased, with plans to develop to 20 head of livestock after autumn. The fertilizer, butter, and part of the manure used in spring planting were all purchased with public funds. (They had land that was not fertilized every year. Last year, 15 hectares of upland land were not fertilized, accounting for about one-fifth of the cultivated area; the land that was fertilized was only given an average of 30 carts per hectare. This year, all the land was generally fertilized, with more than 40 carts per hectare. This is the highest record of manure application that nearby farmers have ever had.) They also deposited another 10 million yuan into the cooperative to solve the production difficulties of some farmers nearby.

**Agricultural Technology Further Improved**

The superiority of the agricultural production cooperative has also been proven in improving agricultural technology. The upland land, called "fish spine" by farmers, has also been used with new farm implements this year. Cooperative member Liu Zuorong, holding the horse-drawn implements on the upland, pointed to the improved brown-yellow soil and said: "For this piece of land (two hectares), we will also ask it for 20 *shi* of grain. Apply more manure and use new farm implements, and we will definitely harvest more grain." In the past, they had conservative ideas, believing that "plowing the upland too deeply will bring up yellow soil, and the soil will become cold and crops will not grow"; so in previous years, they used clumsy plows to plow. This year, they broke this idea, paving the way for the use of new farm implements in mountainous areas in the future. The production cooperative's ease of accepting advanced technology has also been proven here. This year, two hectares and three *mu* of soybeans were experimentally inoculated with rhizobia; two *mu* of corn and bean land used granular fertilizer; and the seeds of four *mu* of rice seedlings and 3.5 hectares of millet seeds were all treated with chemicals. A contract was signed with the Linzhengke Section of the County People's Government to create a nursery on 1.3 hectares of land. They established a technical research association and conducted preliminary experimental work.

**The Bud of Collectivist Thought**

With the development of the cooperative's economy, cherishing public property has become a new morality and new atmosphere. They have combined personal interests with the interests of the entire cooperative. One evening in late May, when the members were chatting together during a break from work, Gao Chenghe expressed the following opinion: "We now rely on the cooperative. If the cooperative is doing well, we ourselves will also be doing well." Speaking of this, he seemed ashamed of his past selfishness, lowered his head and thought for a while, and then said: "Last year during spring planting, I was also very selfish. When I saw people with rubber-wheeled carts going out to do odd jobs, I thought about making more money myself and went out to do odd jobs. Thinking about it, this is all selfishness!" At this point, Yu He chimed in and said, "That's right! In the past, I saw cattle trampling on other people's land and I didn't care. The day before yesterday, I felt sorry for the land when I saw cattle trampling on it. Because I also have a share in it! I caught it." In this way, new habits and collectivist ideas are sprouting here. Han En's wife, Zhang Suzhen (a party member), is already the mother of six children. During the busy farming season, she gets up every day in the middle of the night to cook for the collective canteen, and takes care of other people's breastfed babies during the day. Someone advised her to rest, but she said: "Our lives are better, but we can't forget our roots. For the cooperative, and to move towards a collective farm, a little tiredness is nothing." An atmosphere of mutual love has also begun to develop among the members. When dividing the vegetable plots, the old members voluntarily gave the good land to the new members to plant. When Yang Chengxue was ill, Chi Dianwen sent him rice and helped him invite a doctor. On the two days when there was no farm work to do, Niu Defang and others voluntarily went to repair the horse pen. Fang Laotaitai, whose temples were already white, removed manure every morning and evening, keeping the horse pen clean. The agricultural production cooperative has changed people who used to be poor at work. Since the beginning of spring planting, 11 women have often gone to the fields. Sometimes, even when the men were off work, the women insisted on plowing the last *mu* of ridges before going home.

**Breaking Conservative Ideas**

In the nearly three months since the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, the members have further experienced the benefits of the agricultural production cooperative and broken their conservative ideas. When the cooperative formulated a high-yield plan, the members did not have confidence. Even Chi Dianwen, the deputy director of the cooperative, did not have confidence in the cooperative's plan to increase production by 20 percent compared to last year. Later, after carefully calculating the accounts and increasing manure and improving technology, everyone was confident in increasing the unit area yield by more than 30 percent. Zhao Qin, who joined the cooperative with a "try it and see" attitude, saw the superior conditions of the cooperative in two months of collective labor, and received 1.2 million yuan when engaging in sideline production in the spring. Now he fully trusts the cooperative. Even Zhang Xikui, who was once unwilling to invest in the cooperative, now truly knows the benefits of the cooperative. He said: "When mutual aid teams plant vegetables, one family needs a plow, but now one plow is enough to plow everyone's land." He actively participates in various meetings of the cooperative and often expresses opinions on improving technology.

**Leading the Masses of Farmers to Advance Together**

The Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative is a bright banner on the patriotic high-yield competition front. Under the influence of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative, the mutual aid teams in Xinli Village formed a joint team this year to learn from Han En; establishing an agricultural production cooperative next year has become their goal. During the spring planting, they competed with the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative step by step. The members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative went to the fields at 4:30, and the mutual aid teams in Xinli Village also went to the fields at 4:00 the next day; when the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative started plowing, they followed suit. In order to compete with the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative, each village took practical actions to ensure the realization of the high-yield plan. The joint team in Xinli Village and the nearby Ye Jin Agricultural Production Cooperative often sent representatives to visit the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative. Therefore, the spring planting in each village in the whole village was able to be completed quickly this year, and all but Dadianzi Village were shortened by 15 days compared with previous years; Dadianzi Village was also shortened by 10 days.

Moving towards socialism has become the common hope of the members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative. Gao Fengming, 54 years old, often says: "I want to move towards socialism with the young lads." Niu Guizhi, 16 years old, said, "I want to study hard so that I can drive a tractor in the future." They have seen the beautiful scenery of the future and have a far-reaching direction of struggle, so their labor enthusiasm is very high. They are not satisfied with the status quo, and they want to strive for greater victories. Taking advantage of the gap time after spring planting, they harnessed horses to plows and reclaimed wasteland on the meadows in the south. Soon, they will also dig a 1-foot deep and 1-*li* long drainage ditch to prevent mountain floods. Now, the members are brewing a summer weeding competition plan to welcome the new victory of summer production.

In Baowan Village, there is a life of happy labor and youthful strength everywhere. One can often hear male and female members singing excitedly in the fields and in the village:

"We are the new farmers of Baowan Village,
Everyone has opened their old minds.
We have established a production cooperative,
The Communist Party is our leader,
.........................
Just because the mutual aid teams are well-run,
The foundation of the cooperative is deeply rooted.
Every step we take is on a bright road,
The scenery of the whole village is renewed every day.
Scattered land has been connected into pieces,
Scattered mules and horses have been combined into groups.
New farm implements are powerful,
Patriotic grain production has increased by hundreds of tons.
... We have strength, we have confidence,
We cooperate in division of labor,
We work together and strive harder and harder!
Towards collective farms, towards socialism,
We are moving forward by leaps and bounds!"

    韩恩农业生产合作社春耕播种的胜利
    罗颕民　贾忠林
    “向全国挑战，决不能落后！”韩恩农业生产合作社在社员们相互鼓励中，胜利地完成了春耕播种竞赛计划。
    四月初，春雪初融，早上晚上道路冻得冰硬，午间道路又很泥泞。这时候，他们开始送粪了。六大片黑褐色的土地上，整齐地一排一排地摆满了黑色的粪堆。他们送完了粪，就用胶轮车拉黑土往地里送，以便改良土壤。四月下旬，冻结了的土地还没有完全化透，洼地里还有积水，新农具组就开始着手翻岗地。做了充分的准备，韩恩农业生产合作社的春季播种工作在五月十日就开始了。
    紧张的播种工作
    韩恩农业生产合作社在春耕播种中是十分紧张的。鸡叫二遍，天将破晓（四点钟左右），屯里就响起了钟声，社员就都起床了。男女社员一伙一伙地聚集起来，整理着绳套，议论着当天的活计。早饭后，约五点钟，当天的劳动就开始了。那几天，站在屯头，就可以看到：在南面的土地上，春风吹过，播种机的后面不时扬起黄色的灰尘。头上扎着白毛巾的妇女组成的搂槎组，在紧张地搂槎子。她们指着正在播种的新农具组说：“我们一定要比过他们！”她们按照自己提出的挑战条件，要把每垅槎子上的泥土都细致地打掉。她们把全社十几垧槎棵地全部搂净了。在嫩绿色的山脚下，阳光普照的田地里，我们也可以看到一幅紧张的劳动场面。山岗地上，三付旧犁杖在播种。平地上，两台播种机轻快地拖过；三台胶轮车继续往地里拉黑土。为了完成春耕竞赛计划，他们抓紧每一分钟，向大自然进行斗争。五月十八日，一个雨后的早晨，洼地太湿不能种，社员们就在岗地中播种。播种结束后的三、四天，我们在稻田间的路上碰见了合作社副主任迟殿文和农业组长牛德芳；他俩正蹲在地边上测量着幼苗出土的距离，检查着土壤的湿度。他们讲：“这里水分够用。如果天再旱，我们准备再压一遍。”现在，保苗已成为他们的中心任务。他们科学地计算着苗簇的距离，每垧玉米要保持三万六千棵苗。他们说，这就是他们每垧玉米地要打十八石粮的保证。
    春耕播种的成绩
    五月二十日，全社胜利地结束了春耕播种工作。晚上，社员们庆祝播种的胜利，同时总结春耕播种工作。今年春天的播种期缩短了，往年需要十五天时间，今年只用了十天。施肥也超过了原订计划。在春耕中，胶轮车一直继续往地里拉土粪，完成了改良十五垧地的计划。半垧水田拉进了五十多车沙子，四十二垧旱地普遍上了满粪，每垧平均上四十五大车（每车二千斤），比往年增加了十五车，比原计划增加了五车。除了底粪以外，又追加了各种速效肥料。十二垧地的玉米籽拌了牛油和草木灰。另外的二垧高额产量地（玉米、谷子）多上了十车粪。在施肥时，掌握了不同肥料施于不同土壤和不同作物的原则。黄粪都上在洼地和玉米地里，猪圈粪上在黄豆地里。经过试验，知道南山地土壤酸性较大，需要施灰粪；现在全社已准备下五百斤灰粪，到夏锄前可准备三千斤。为了防止春旱，在播种前，把平作（没有垅的）庄稼地耙了几遍（往年只耙一遍），播种后全用镇压器压了一遍；高作（有垅的）庄稼地也在种完以后用磙子压了一遍。使用新农具的地深耕到七寸（比往年深耕一寸），作到随耕随耙。用新农具播种的，宽窄一般齐，禾苗出土整齐。用旧农具播种的，苗播得较稠，玉米每簇四、五棵，一平方公尺四簇；大豆每平方公尺三十棵。这些成绩，在没有组成生产合作社以前是很难做到的。
    统一使用土地的好处
    在春耕过程中，农业生产合作社显示了它的优越性。全社统一使用了土地，打破了地界。过去，二十五垧地分散成四十多小块；如今，已按着地势连成六大片，增加了一垧半的耕种面积。过去这家种玉米，那家种黄豆，这就不能发挥新农具的效用，每天播种以前还得从播种机的输种管里弄净头天剩下的种籽。过去也不能充分地发挥地力。郜凤鸣的一垧六亩地，最适于种大豆，但他为了自己吃用，年年要种八、九亩玉米。现在全社六大片土地都种着清一色的庄稼：南山一片大豆，东南一大片谷子，河西一大片玉米。另外，他们现在也能够进行土地加工工作了。经过改良土壤，黏土已基本上变为壤土，黄土已变成沃土；他们正把凸凹地逐渐改成平地。
    合理使用劳动力
    在劳动力的组织分工上，比以前更加合理了，现在根据特长分工，分工分业更加细密，做到了合理使用劳动力。绳匠李行君负责打绳套；木匠于和负责修理农具、打马枷板；养马多年的老方头专责喂马；点籽能手迟殿武等专门点籽；老农韩义、牛德芳管理、使用旧犁；学习过使用新农具的崔海管理、使用新农具。他们各专一门，发挥了特长，劳动效率不断提高。过去每人都忙着做自己的活，有胶皮车的人农忙时还想出去拉脚，拖延了春耕播种工作，活干不过来。过去在拨工时也常发生困难，如给郜文库拨两个半劳动力，他不要，因为这样要多做一个人的饭，但是干活很少。这回统一支配劳动力，就克服了这些困难。他们并且初步订出了工作定额；搂槎子一垧地四个工，用新农具平均一天翻半垧多地。全社集中喂马，克服了过去“一股肠子八下扯”的现象。早晨有专人打钟，大伙能安心睡觉。由于大片土地种一色庄稼，使劳动力的使用更加合理了。总的来说，春耕中劳动效率提高了许多。往年用新式犁二人二马一天耕四亩地，今年能耕半垧地；往年用播种机三人二马一天种二垧半地，今年能种四垧地。在整个春耕期间，约共节省了二百个人工。节省下的劳动力大部用于精耕细作、改良土壤和积粪送粪，还抽出二十多个剩余劳动力在七天中种树一垧三亩。往年互助组省下的劳动力都去搞副业，对农业有些荒废；今年已经纠正了这种偏向。
    公共资金在生产上发挥了效力
    过去，互助组的公共资金找不到出路，由干部存到银行或放到外屯，没有用到扩大再生产上，没有发挥应有的效用。很多组员对这表示不满。现在合作社统一支配资金，把它用到信贷、扩大再生产和发展畜牧方面。今年春耕时牲畜不足，就用八百万元买进四头牲口，最近又买了两头菜牛，秋后准备发展到二十头牲口。春耕中所用肥田粉、牛油和一部分粪，都是用公共资金买的。（他们历年都有不上粪的地，去年十五垧山岗地没上粪，约占耕地面积的五分之一；上粪的地每垧平均只上了三十车。今年所有的地普遍上了粪，每垧上了四十多车。这是附近农民从来没有过的上粪的最高纪录。）他们另用一千万元存入合作社，解决了附近一些农民在生产上的困难。
    农业技术更加提高了
    在提高农业技术方面，也证明了农业生产合作社的优越性。被农民称为“鱼脊梁骨”的山岗地，今年也都使用了新农具。社员刘作荣在山岗上扶着马拉农具，指着经过改良的褐黄色土地说：“就这块地（二垧），我们也管他要二十石谷子。多上粪，使用新农具，一准多打粮。”过去他们有保守思想，认为“山岗地翻深了上黄土，土发凉不长庄稼”；所以往年都是用笨犁来耕。今年他们打破了这个想法，为今后在山地使用新农具开辟了道路。生产合作社容易接受先进技术，在这里也得到了证明。今年有二垧三亩大豆试用根瘤菌接种；二亩玉米、豆子地使用了颗粒肥料；四亩稻秧种籽和三垧半地的谷种籽都用了药剂拌种。还有一垧三亩地和县人民政府林政科订合同作成苗圃。他们设立了技术研究会，并初步进行了试验工作。
    集体主义思想的萌芽
    随着合作社经济的发展，爱护公共财物已成为人们的新道德新风气。他们把个人利益和合作社全体的利益结合了起来。五月下旬的一个傍晚，散工休息的时候，社员们在一起闲谈。高成和发表了这样一个意见：“我们现在就是依靠合作社，合作社搞好了我们自己随着也就好了。”说到这里，他好像对过去自己的自私自利感到惭愧，低下头想了想，又说：“去年春耕时，我的自私心也很大，看到有胶轮车的都要出去拉脚，我就寻思着自己也多赚些钱，随着出去拉脚。想起来这都是自私自利呀！”说到这里，于和搭腔说：“可不是！过去牛糟蹋别人的地，我看见也不管。前天我看见牛糟蹋地，就心疼。因为这也有我一份呀！我把它捉住了。”就是这样，新的风气、集体主义的思想在这里萌芽了。韩恩的爱人张素贞（党员），已经是六个孩子的母亲了，农忙时，天天半夜起床，为集体食堂做饭，白天还给别人代管吃奶的婴儿。有人劝她休息，她说：“生活富裕了，可不能忘本。为了合作社，为了向集体农庄走，累一点不算啥。”社员间也开始养成了相互友爱的气氛。分菜地时，老社员把好地自动让给新社员种。杨成学有病，迟殿文就给他送大米，帮助他请大夫。有两天没有农活做，牛德芳等就自动去修马圈。鬓发已白的方老太太，每天早晚都去除粪，把马圈收拾得干干净净的。农业生产合作社改变了过去劳动较差的人。从春耕开始，十一名妇女就经常下地。有时，男子都收工了，妇女还坚持要刨完最后的一亩槎子才回家。
    打破了保守思想
    在农业生产合作社成立将近三个月的过程中，社员们更加体验到农业生产合作社的好处，打破了保守思想。合作社订立丰产计划时，社员都没有信心，甚至合作社副主任迟殿文对全社比去年增产百分之二十的计划也没有信心。以后经过算细帐和增加粪肥、提高技术，大家对提高单位面积产量百分之三十以上都满有信心了。抱着“试试看”的态度参加合作社的赵勤，在两个月的集体劳动中，看到了合作社的优越条件，而且在春季搞副业时分得一百二十万元，现在对合作社完全信任了。就连曾经不愿入股的张喜奎，现在也真正知道了合作社的好处。他说：“互助组种菜，一家需要一付犁，现在只要一付犁就把大伙的地耕好了。”他主动地参加合作社的各种会议，常常发表改进技术的意见。
    带动农民群众共同前进
    韩恩农业生产合作社是爱国丰产竞赛战线上的一面鲜明的旗帜。新立屯的互助组，在韩恩农业生产合作社的影响下，今年成立联组，学习韩恩；明年搞农业生产合作社，已成为他们的奋斗目标。在春耕中，他们一步跟一步地和韩恩农业生产合作社竞赛。韩恩农业生产合作社的社员们四点半下地，第二天新立屯的互助组也在四点多钟下地；韩恩农业生产合作社开犁了，他们也就跟着开犁。为了和韩恩农业生产合作社竞赛，各屯都用实际行动保证丰产计划的实现。新立屯的联组，附近的叶金农业生产合作社，都经常派代表到韩恩农业生产合作社参观。因此，今年全村各屯的春耕都能够迅速完成，除了大甸子屯以外，都较往年缩短了十五天；大甸子屯也缩短了十天。
    走向社会主义已成为韩恩农业生产合作社的社员们的共同的希望。五十四岁的郜凤鸣常说：“我要和年青的小伙子们一道走向社会主义。”十六岁的牛桂芝表示“要好好学习，将来好开拖拉机”。他们看到了将来的美景，有了远大的奋斗方向，因此，他们的劳动热情是很高的。他们没有满足于现状，他们要争取更大的胜利。他们趁着春耕播种后的空隙时间，架着马拉犁，在南边的草甸子上开荒。不久，他们还要挖一条一尺深一里长的顺水沟，防止山洪雨涝。现在，社员们正酝酿着订立夏锄竞赛计划，迎接夏季生产的新胜利。
    在保安屯，到处都是愉快劳动的生活，都是青春的力量。时常可以听到男女社员们在田地里、在屯里兴奋地歌唱着：
    “我们是保安屯的新农民，大家打开了旧脑筋。
    成立了生产合作社，共产党是我们的领导人，
    ……………………
    只因为互助组办得好，合作社的基础扎得深。
    步步走的是光明道，全屯光景日日新。
    零块的土地连成了片，分散的骡马合成群。
    新式的农具力量大，爱国粮增产几百吨。
    ……我们有力量，我们有信心，
    分工合作，齐心努力，越干越有劲！
    朝着集体农庄，走向社会主义，
    大踏步向前进！”
