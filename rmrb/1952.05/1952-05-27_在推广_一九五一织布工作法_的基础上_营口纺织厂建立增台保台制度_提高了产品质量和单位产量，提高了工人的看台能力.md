    Based on the promotion of the "1951 Weaving Method,"
    Yingkou Textile Factory Establishes System for Increasing and Maintaining Looms
    Improves Product Quality and Unit Output, Enhances Workers' Loom Tending Abilities
    The system for increasing and maintaining looms established in the weaving workshop of the Yingkou Textile Factory has powerfully promoted the popularization of the "1951 Weaving Method" and improved production efficiency and product quality. The main purpose of establishing this system is to require weavers to first focus on improving product quality and unit output when learning the "1951 Weaving Method," and then increase the number of looms they tend (the number of looms looked after, same below) after their output and quality have reached a certain standard.

    In the past, the allocation of looms in the weaving workshop of the Yingkou Textile Factory was unreasonable. There were no fixed standards for determining which weavers' looms should be increased or decreased; it was only a rough estimate of the weavers' output and quality that determined loom adjustments. Many workers with low output and quality were given more looms to tend, while the potential of individual skilled workers was not fully utilized. As a result, some workers with poor skills earned more than those with good skills.

    The leadership of the Yingkou Textile Factory had previously proposed solving this problem, but it was not treated as an important issue. At the beginning of this year, the factory began to promote the "1951 Weaving Method," and the leading cadres realized that this problem had to be resolved immediately. By February, the scope of the "1951 Weaving Method" promotion had expanded, the skills of most workers had improved, and the production situation was improving daily. At the same time, workers' political awareness had generally increased through the practical education of the "Three-Anti" movement, and their enthusiasm for learning advanced work methods was high. Based on the specific situation, leading cadres mobilized workers for democratic discussions and gradually established a system for increasing and maintaining looms. This system stipulates that weavers can only increase the number of looms they tend after their products meet certain output and quality standards; otherwise, the number of looms will be reduced. Workers who have participated in "1951 Weaving Method" training must be able to change shuttles in two major sections and four minor sections and fully implement the "1951 Weaving Method" to increase the number of looms they tend. Workers who have not participated in training can also increase the number of looms they tend if they can master the two major sections and four minor sections shuttle changing method through self-study. In terms of output, workers tending four or six looms can increase the number of looms they tend by two if each loom can produce 34 yards of plain cloth (mechanical efficiency reaching 91.12%). Workers tending six or eight looms will have two looms reduced if each loom's output is less than 31.5 yards (mechanical efficiency reaching 84.87%). Workers tending four looms will be transferred to "nurturing looms" to learn if each loom's output is less than 31 yards. In terms of quality, if more than one piece of substandard cloth is produced, the number of looms cannot be increased regardless of output; if more than three pieces of substandard cloth are produced, the number of looms will be reduced regardless of output. Workers producing 30 yards of plain cloth or 30.5 yards of twill cloth per loom, but whose entire month's products are standard cloth, can still maintain the original number of looms (loom maintenance standard). Workers tending four looms who do not meet the loom maintenance standards in terms of output and quality will be transferred to "nurturing looms" for learning. The nurturing period is six days, and the learning content mainly focuses on the "1951 Weaving Method."

    The Yingkou Textile Factory began to establish the system for increasing and maintaining looms in early February. After a considerable period of preparation, it was officially implemented in March. Many workers were initially skeptical, but after the formal implementation, they all perked up. Some workers said, "This is something to strive for! Improve our skills and work hard!" Others said, "There will be no more deviations in the future. As long as we have the ability, we can increase the number of looms we tend." Workers with lower output who did not yet meet the conditions for reducing looms were afraid of not meeting the standards and worked particularly hard. Skilled workers wanted to improve their production further to increase the number of looms they tended. Workers who had been relatively conservative realized that they would not be able to cope if they did not learn the "1951 Weaving Method," and they all expressed their attitudes: "I will study hard in the future, otherwise there will be no hope of increasing the number of looms!" This powerfully stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm, causing output and quality to continuously improve. Initially, the nurturing workers were not in high spirits; some felt they had no future, and some complained about the low wages. However, after a combination of technical and political education, they quickly dispelled their concerns and understood that after a short period of learning to improve their skills, they could increase more wealth for the country and earn more wages themselves. They all automatically formulated learning plans and work return plans. After the Yingkou Textile Factory implemented the system for increasing and maintaining looms, the "1951 Weaving Method" was promoted more smoothly. Workers who had already participated in training were able to continue their efforts to achieve complete proficiency; workers who had not yet participated in training organized self-study and actively asked "little teachers" for guidance. In this way, many workers learned the "1951 Weaving Method." By the end of March, all the workers in the workshop had learned the "1951 Weaving Method," and 40% of them were fully proficient in this work method.

    As the workers' production enthusiasm and learning enthusiasm increased, the factory's production steadily increased. For example, the average weaving machine efficiency was 86.93% in early March, rising to 87.83% in mid-March, and then reaching 88.68% in late March. Quality also greatly improved. For example, the rate of first-grade cloth was 97.57% in January, 98.09% in February, and 98.37% in March. The workers' loom tending abilities increased. By the end of March, workers tending eight machines accounted for 9.2% of the total, and workers tending six machines accounted for 42%; the average loom tending ability increased from 5.1 looms in January to 5.3 looms in March.

    The experience of the Yingkou Textile Factory fully demonstrates the superiority of the system for increasing and maintaining looms.
    It is not only a reasonable reward and punishment system, but also the most effective way to improve workers' skills and correct workers' work attitudes. From this, it can be seen that the establishment of a system for increasing and maintaining looms must be combined with the promotion of advanced experience to improve workers' technical level, and should not simply emphasize increasing and maintaining looms. The formulation of a system for increasing and maintaining looms should be based on planned targets, while also taking into account specific circumstances to prevent deviations such as increasing too many looms or nurturing too many workers.
    Finally, the formulation of a system for increasing and maintaining looms must be done through democratic discussions by all workers in order to become the conscious action of the masses.

### 在推广“一九五一织布工作法”的基础上  营口纺织厂建立增台保台制度  提高了产品质量和单位产量，提高了工人的看台能力

    在推广“一九五一织布工作法”的基础上
    营口纺织厂建立增台保台制度
    提高了产品质量和单位产量，提高了工人的看台能力
    营口纺织厂织布车间建立的增台保台制度，有力地推动了“一九五一织布工作法”的推广工作，提高了生产效率和产品质量。建立这个制度的主要目的，是要求织布工人在学习“一九五一织布工作法”时，首先重视提高产品质量和单位产量，在产量、质量达到一定标准的基础上，再增加看台（看布机的台数，下同）。
    营口纺织厂织布车间，过去在调配布机工作上，是不合理的。那个织布工人的看台应该增加，那个工人的看台应该减少，没有一定的标准，只是粗略地估计一下织布工人的产量和质量，就增台或减台。许多在生产上产量、质量不高的工人，反而增加了看台，个别技术好的工人，却没有很好地发挥潜在能力。这样，个别技术差的工人，工资收入反比技术好的工人多。
    营口纺织厂领导方面以前曾提出要解决这个问题，但没有当作一个重要的问题来解决。今年年初，该厂开始推广“一九五一织布工作法”，领导干部才认识到这个问题必须立即加以解决。到二月份，推广“一九五一织布工作法”的范围扩大了，大多数工人的技术提高了，生产情况日见好转；同时，工人经过“三反”运动的实际教育，政治觉悟普遍提高，学习先进工作法的热情高涨。领导干部根据具体情况，发动工人民主讨论，逐步建立了增台保台制度。这个制度规定了织布工人的产品达到一定的产量、质量标准以后，才能增加看台，反之就减台。参加过“一九五一织布工作法”轮训的工人，要能分两大段四小节换梭，并完全执行“一九五一织布工作法”，才能增加看台。没有参加轮训的工人，经过自学后，能掌握两大段四小节换梭法，也可增加看台。在产量上，看四台或六台布机的工人，如每台布机能产三十四码平纹布（机械效率达到百分之九十一点一二），可以增看二台布机。看六台或八台布机的工人，如每台产量低于三十一点五码（机械效率达百分之八十四点八七），则减少二台布机。看四台布机的工人，如每台产量低于三十一码时，将被调到养成的布机上学习。在质量上，等外布超过一匹，不论产量如何，一律不能增加看台；等外布超过三匹，不论产量如何，一律减少看台；每台布机产量如为平纹布三十码或斜纹布三十点五码，但全月产品都是标准布者，仍可保持原来台数（保台标准）。看四台布机的工人，产量、质量达不到保台标准时，将被调到养成的布机学习。养成期为六天，学习的内容主要是“一九五一织布工作法”。
    营口纺织厂是二月上旬开始建立增台保台制度的。经过相当时期的酝酿，三月起正式实行。许多工人在最初还将信将疑，等到正式实行以后，才都提起了劲。有的工人说：“这可有奔头了！提高技术，使劲干吧！”有的工人说：“以后再不会发生偏差了，只要有能力，就可以增加看台。”产量较低但还不够减少看台条件的工人，他们只怕达不到标准，生产特别起劲。技术较好的工人，则想把生产更提高一步，以增加看台。一向比较保守的工人，认识到再不学“一九五一织布工作法”，就要吃不开了，都纷纷表示态度：“我以后要好好学习，否则就没希望增加看台啦！”这就有力地刺激了工人的生产情绪，使产量、质量不断提高。最初养成工都情绪不高，有的感到没有前途，有的嫌工资低。但经过技术和政治相结合的教育以后，随即打消了顾虑，明白了经过短时期的学习提高技术后，能为国家增加更多的财富，自己也能得更多的工资，都自动地订出学习计划及回厂工作计划。营口纺织厂实行增台保台制度以后，“一九五一织布工作法”推广得更顺利了，已经参加过轮训的工人，都能继续努力以达到全部熟练的程度；还没有参加轮训的工人，纷纷组织自学，主动请“小先生”教导。这样，很多工人都学会了“一九五一织布工作法”。到三月底，全车间的工人都学过了“一九五一织布工作法”，其中对这一工作法全部精通的工人占十分之四。
    随着工人生产情绪及学习热情的提高，该厂生产稳步上升。如三月上旬平均织布机效率是百分之八十六点九三，中旬升为百分之八十七点八三，下旬则达百分之八十八点六八。质量也大为提高。如一月份正布率为百分之九十七点五七，二月份为百分之九十八点零九，三月份则为百分之九十八点三七。工人的看台能力增高了，到三月底，看八台机的工人占总人数的百分之九点二，看六台机的工人占百分之四十二；平均看台能力从一月份的五点一台增加到三月份的五点三台。
    营口纺织厂的经验充分证明了增台保台制度的优越性。
    它不但是合理的奖罚制度，而且是提高工人的技术，端正工人劳动态度的最有效的办法。从这里可以看出，建立增台保台制度必须和推广先进经验相结合，提高工人的技术水平，不应单纯强调增台保台。制订增台保台制度要以计划指标为依据，同时必须照顾具体情况，防止发生增台过多或养成过多的偏差。
    最后，增台保台制度的制定，必须通过全体工人民主讨论，才能成为群众的自觉行动。
