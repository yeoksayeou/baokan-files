    Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau
    Should Quickly Allocate Funds for Grain Depot Repair

    To the Editor: The public grain in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, is stored in four grain depots, all of which leak when it rains. The most serious is the No. 2 plank depot, which leaked in 217 places during last year's rainfall. The lightest, No. 1 plank depot, also had 43 leaks. This is very unfavorable for grain storage. In the summer of 1951, due to the leaking grain depots, many people had to collect rainwater inside the depot when it rained, and the grain had to be turned over when the rain stopped, wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. Moreover, if the turning was done a little late, the grain would sprout. One night in July last year, it rained, and some of the grain sprouted the next day.

    In order to prevent the grain from being rained on, the Keshan County Public Grain Depot submitted a plan to the Provincial Grain Bureau last year to repair the leaking grain depots in the spring of 1952. When the Provincial Grain Bureau convened a meeting of depot directors on February 18 this year, the Keshan County Public Grain Depot director again put forward a plan to repair the leaking grain depots before May to avoid further losses to the grain when the rainy season arrives. However, as of now, the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau has not allocated repair funds. According to our understanding, the Northeast District Grain Administration had approved 200 million yuan in repair funds to the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau before May 10. The Provincial Grain Bureau instructed the public grain depots in various counties this year to seize the time to dry the grain, which is entirely necessary. However, the dried grain will still be susceptible to moisture and mold if it is re-loaded into the leaking depot when it rains. We believe that the Heilongjiang Provincial Grain Bureau should quickly allocate repair funds so that construction can begin as soon as possible to repair the depots.

### 黑龙江省粮食局  应迅速拨发经费修缮粮库

    黑龙江省粮食局
    应迅速拨发经费修缮粮库
    编辑同志：黑龙江省克山县公粮分放在四个粮食仓库中，这些仓库下雨时都漏雨。其中最严重的是二号板库，去年下雨时，就有二百一十七处漏雨。最轻的一号板库也有四十三处漏雨。这对粮食保管工作是很不利的。一九五一年夏季因粮库漏雨，下雨时就用了很多人到库内接雨水，雨过时就要翻扬粮食，浪费了很多人力物力，而且翻的稍晚，粮食就会生芽。去年七月某夜下雨，第二天就有一部分粮食生了芽。
    为了使粮食不受雨淋，克山县公粮仓库在去年就向省粮食局提出了一九五二年春季修缮漏雨粮库的计划。今年二月十八日省粮食局召集仓库主任开会时，克山县公粮仓库主任又提出计划，要在五月份以前把漏雨的粮库修好，以免雨季到来，使粮食继续遭受损失。但直到目前为止，黑龙江省粮食局还没有拨给修缮费。据我们了解，东北区粮食管理局在五月十日以前已批给黑龙江省粮食局修缮费两亿元。省粮食局今年曾指示各县公粮仓库要抓紧晾晒粮食，这是完全必要的。但是晾晒后的粮食再装到漏雨的库内，下雨时还是要受潮发霉的。我们认为黑龙江省粮食局应当迅速拨发修缮费，以便及早动工修缮仓库。
