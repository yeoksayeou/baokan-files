Workers' Opinions and Hopes for Literary and Artistic Work
    A Record of the Workers' Literary and Art Symposium Jointly Held by This Newspaper and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions

    In the days leading up to the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," this newspaper and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly invited sixty-two active participants in literary and artistic activities and trade union cultural and educational cadres from twenty-seven factories and mines in Beijing's urban and suburban areas to hold a symposium. Before attending this meeting, the participants had widely solicited opinions from workers in their respective units. At the symposium, they actively, responsibly, and enthusiastically reflected the opinions and hopes of the working masses regarding literary and artistic work. In dozens of speeches, everyone agreed that literary and artistic works have not adequately represented workers in recent years, and that professional literary and artistic organizations and workers have not served the workers well enough. They also proposed that "literary and artistic treatment" for the working masses should be improved. The symposium also discussed the issue of literary and artistic workers going down to factories, the popularization and improvement of literature and art, and other issues.

    Literature and Art Must Represent Workers and Face Workers

    Zhao Rui from the Shijingshan Power Plant said: "I remember when the Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles was established, Comrade Peng Zhen instructed us: 'Literature and art must face workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially industrial workers.' However, to this day, there are too few creations that face workers, and too few performances that face workers." Many comrades said: "The song is still 'We Workers Have Strength'!" "The only films that represent workers that are well-received are 'The Bridge' and 'Boundless Radiance'." "Novels and dramas that reflect the lives of workers, whether long or short, are rarely seen."

    Worker comrades very much like to read comic books (small books with pictures). According to a statistic from one mine, they borrowed 8,000 copies in a month, averaging several copies per person per month. However, very few of these drawings depict workers, and many of those that do are distorted, crude, or even harmful. Wang Zhaochen from the Liulihe Cement Plant said:

    "Many drawings of workers simply don't look like workers, and it's boring to look at them. The energy is forced, not from the workers' hearts." Guo Maolin from Factory 546 said: "I saw a picture on 'Learning Culture' where a worker's foot was on a lathe, which is completely fabricated. We workers take care of our machines." Tong Pingya, a trade union cadre from the Jingxi Mining Area in Mentougou, reflected: "The 'Coal Miners' Song' starts with 'Don't look at us black, don't look at us dirty...' When coal miners sing this, they say: 'Look, the first thing he sees in our song is our blackness and dirt!'"

    Workers from various factories in the Jingxi Mining Area said that they have almost never seen works depicting coal miners. Ma Ning, a trade union cadre from the Jingxi Mining Area, said: "The writers haven't come to the mining area to see how rich and moving our anti-foreman struggles and production struggles are!" Li Zhang from the Chengzi Coal Mine said: "Take 'Learning Culture,' for example. We look at it every day, but it never has anything to do with us."

    Regarding the issue of literary and artistic performances and other literary and artistic activities facing workers, everyone raised many opinions. Good shows like "Dragon Beard Ditch," "The Long March," "How the Steel Was Tempered," and "Strike the Aggressors" are difficult for workers in the city to get tickets for, and those outside the city have no way to see them at all. Sometimes, tickets reserved for 3,000 yuan each are given by the theater for 5,000 or 7,000 yuan. When workers negotiate with the box office, the box office people say: "We have the right to decide." So they have to watch the 7,000 yuan tickets. But sometimes, even paying a high price doesn't get you tickets, because a show is often booked out by institutions, and it's hard for workers to get tickets. Workers in the suburbs find it very difficult to come to the city to see a good movie even once. Films like "Resist America, Aid Korea," which everyone is eager to see, were shown in the Jingxi Mining Area only after being shown in the city for two months. Zhao Rui from the Shijingshan Power Plant said: "We have a movie projector in our factory, but going to the North China Film Management Company to rent films is like going to a sesame cake shop to buy sesame cakes. It doesn't take into account what kind of films workers should be watching at all." He also said: "Workers love to watch movies, but some movies are not easy for workers to understand, and there are also few articles in newspapers and magazines that introduce films in a popular style." In addition, they believe that movie rental fees are still too expensive for factories.

    Tong Pingya, a trade union cadre from the Jingxi Mining Area, and Qi Xinmin from the Chengzi Coal Mine both said: There are 20,000 workers in the Jingxi Mining Area, but there is no cinema, only a small theater, and tickets are often sold out in an hour. The theatrical programs are also of the "Beating the Heartless Lover" and "Li Sanniang Draws Water" type. The storytellers even more seriously promote feudal and harmful things. Workers go to see plays about White Peony and Begonia Red after work, and after watching they say: "That's funny." This cannot solve the cultural life problems of workers. Ma Ning from the Jingxi Coal Mine said that workers are subjected to two hours of communist education every day, but are poisoned by these feudal ideological dramas. Workers in various factories in the city also believe that although the content of Pingju opera has undergone great reforms and many new dramas have been performed, such as "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "The Little Son-in-Law," they have played a role in publicizing the Marriage Law. However, the performance of many actors is still unhealthy and not serious. The same is true of crosstalk. Cao Yali from the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau said: "Some crosstalk only plays tricks, and is even worse than playing tricks."

    Workers warmly welcome professional literary and artistic groups to perform in factories. Zhao Rui said: "Comrades from the Youth Art Theater have performed in the Shijingshan Power Plant several times, and the worker comrades often ask me to pass on a message, hoping that they will go again." Everyone believes that there are still too few professional literary and artistic groups performing in factories. Especially in the suburbs, this opinion and request is consistent. Everyone hopes that professional literary and artistic groups will not emphasize that the performance conditions in factories are not good and are unwilling to perform in factories. These difficulties can be overcome.

    Opinions on Factory Leadership

    The lack of time for literary and artistic activities is a common difficulty in many factories. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Power Plant have almost no time for literary and artistic activities at all. Xu Dongyuan of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant raised objections to the factory's leaders not caring about or valuing workers' literary and artistic activities: "Last year, the factory leaders spent several million yuan each time inviting Li Wanchun, Xu Dongming, and Xin Fengxia to perform in the factory, but they paid very little attention to the factory's literary and artistic activities. The drama troupe had no place to rehearse and had to go to the workers' homes. The troupe has been engaged in literary and artistic activities for more than a year and has achieved results, but has not received any praise." Ping Ruifen from the Beijing Garment Factory said: "Our factory has not engaged in literary and artistic activities for a year. During the 'Three-Anti' movement, the leadership suddenly remembered that literary and artistic activities were useful, so they called on us to make a breakthrough. The leadership does not support literary and artistic activities. They grab it when they need it, and push it away when they don't."

    Leadership attention is a very important condition for carrying out workers' literary and artistic activities. Comrades from the Liulihe Cement Plant said that thanks to the leadership's attention, the literary and artistic activities in their factory have developed anew. The literary and artistic activities in their factory have been popularized to the workshops, and the workshop literary and artistic groups played a good role during the "Three-Anti" period. Their leaders have begun to solve the problem of time for literary and artistic activities. Literary and artistic activities do not hinder production, but promote production.

    Requirements for Literary and Artistic Workers Going Down to Factories

    From the current situation, literary and artistic cadres going down to factories can be divided into two aspects. One is to go down to factories to experience life - to create works, and the other is to guide literary and artistic activities - to help establish literary and artistic organizations, rehearse plays, teach songs, and teach dances. Everyone unanimously believes that there are too few comrades going down to factories, and the time is too short. Tian Geng, from the Club Work Section of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said that according to their statistics, only 65 literary and artistic cadres went down to factories in 1950 (times), most of them were young literary and artistic workers and were short-term. Worker comrades have many opinions and many requirements in this regard.

    Comrades from the Liulihe Cement Plant and many other factories believe that the main difficulty in factory literary and artistic activities is the problem of creation. Literary and artistic workers have not created more and better works for workers, nor have they helped workers to create well.

    The view of simply collecting materials is very serious for many comrades who go down to factories. Cao Yali from the Telecommunications Bureau said:

    "Some comrades came to the factory to collect materials, and the worker comrades were initially very enthusiastic in helping them collect materials. However, after the materials were taken away, there was no news, and the workers were disappointed. If someone comes to the factory with the view of simply collecting materials, they will certainly not write works or good works." These comrades, even though they have gone down to the factory, are still divorced from the masses and divorced from life. Individual comrades have even adopted very bad attitudes. Qi Xinmin from the Chengzi Coal Mine said: "We had a comrade who came to our factory to collect materials. He did not contact the masses, but only grabbed one or two activists. When he wrote, he grabbed one person to accompany him, asking a question and writing a sentence. 'What is this called?' After he was told, he asked again. Sometimes he kept asking until the next point. No one knew what he was writing about." Zhou Hongcai from the Qinghe Woolen Mill once asked a comrade who had come down to the factory to go to the workshop more and unite the masses more. This comrade actually said: "My task is to create. It's no good to unite with the workers no matter how well if there is no creation!" These comrades are unwilling to serve the workers, and take helping workers create as a burden. Many comrades said: "They frown when they see workers sending in manuscripts," saying that the workers' creations are "boring and tasteless." Workers hope that he will help write allegro or folk art, but he says "not an expert," and some people even say to the worker comrades: "It's not easy to create. There was a Soviet writer who wrote a book for forty years!"

    Because some comrades who go down to factories do not go deep into life and do not contact the masses, their understanding of the workers must be wrong. Wang Zhaochen from the Liulihe Cement Plant said: "Some comrades who go down to factories think that they can contact the workers by saying dirty words and learning to scold people. This is a very wrong view of the workers." Yu Wenzhang said: "When a young comrade came down to the factory, he said to the workers: 'The workers are so good!' 'Straightforward' 'Have excellent qualities' and so on, but after a month or two, this comrade's mood changed, and he complained that our workers didn't take care of him enough." Zhou Hongcai from the Qinghe Woolen Mill said: "Some people go down to factories just to throw tantrums, complaining that the stage is small, the place is dirty, and even the food is not good." They said that they first drew a line between themselves and the workers. How can they become one with the workers?

    Few literary and artistic workers go down to factories, the time is short, and they do not try their best to help the workers. Therefore, the combination of writers, artists and workers is not enough. Zhou Tiesheng from the People's Printing Factory said: "We want to send what we write to the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, but we are afraid that their great writers will not read it." He said: "There are many workers in our factory who like to write, but they have never received help from writers."

    Chen Yifu from the Fengtai District Railway Trade Union said: "We hope that writers will come down to the factory, not only to experience life and collect materials, but also to help the workers create." Qi Xinmin from the Chengzi Coal Mine in Mentougou said more enthusiastically: "It doesn't matter if the writers tell us our shortcomings. We just want to know where we are wrong." Many comrades proposed that comrades who go down to factories in the future should regard helping workers create as their own task.

    Regarding how to help workers create, Cao Yali from the Telecommunications Bureau said: "It is wrong to go down to a factory only after it has achieved success in literary and artistic work. Sometimes a large group comes, and we have to send someone to entertain them, which becomes a burden." Cao Yali and many other comrades believe that on the one hand, it is precisely because workers have difficulties in creation that they need to be helped universally; on the other hand, many good things of the masses in the past have not been discovered, but have been buried. Most comrades believe that writers should discover and cultivate worker writers in the movement. If they leave the struggle life and do not touch the workers' creative practice, it is impossible to concentrate and generalize a good work in the future.

    In terms of form, many comrades hope that professional groups will create more short and concise works. Qi Xinmin from the Chengzi Coal Mine said: "Some comrades who go down to the factory look down on allegro and folk art these small forms, and engage in large dramas with several scenes. In fact, this does not meet the universal requirements of the workers." Zhou Tiesheng from the People's Printing Factory said: "Literary and artistic institutions and groups often call for the creation of small plays. We also hope to see more small plays so that we can use them as learning models, but professional groups perform large plays." Qi Xinmin believes that this is probably one of the reasons why professional groups cannot cooperate well with political movements. He hopes that literary and artistic workers can meet the requirements of the workers in this regard in the future.

    Regarding the Guidance Work of Factory Literature and Art

    Everyone believes that the main and serious shortcomings of the past literary and artistic guidance work in various factories were: the roots of literature and art have not been deeply rooted in the working masses; the weapon of literature and art has not been universally mastered by the workers.

    Zhao Rui said: "The Shijingshan Power Plant used to be a factory with very good literary and artistic work, but now it has collapsed! Some of the active members of the drama troupe have become production models - the production flag cannot be used to perform plays, some have gone to study, some have been transferred to the municipal committee of the Communist Youth League, and some have been transferred to the factory's Party committee. I myself have been transferred to be the cultural and educational committee member of the trade union. All the cadres have been uprooted. That is because when a group left, another group was not trained, so the drama troupe collapsed, the singing team collapsed, and the waist drum team collapsed - the waist drum was left in the warehouse to grow mold! That is to say: the roots of literature and art were not deeply rooted, and after a burst of flowers, it withered again!"

    Zhou Hongcai from the Qinghe Woolen Mill talked about another situation. He said: "In the past three years, we have gone from not being able to write to being able to write, from not being able to perform to being able to perform, and from not being able to sing to being able to sing. We have a drama troupe and a singing team. However, this level could no longer develop further half a year ago. Everyone is very well organized and in high spirits, but they are staring blankly. They are watching so many new things, but they can't write them." He said: "I hope that in the future, we can pay attention to the issue of improving workers' literary and artistic work."

    Some comrades reflected that their factory is hot when a tutor goes down once, and depressed when they leave. That is to say: "They can't walk without crutches," and they have not trained their own literary and artistic cadres.

    There are very few dances that express workers. Workers very much hope that dance workers will create strong and powerful dances suitable for workers. Professional literary and artistic groups do not care about or value group dances, so they rarely research, adapt and create them. Individual comrades also believe that it is a loss of identity for dance actors to dance group dances with workers. However, group dance is widely liked by workers. Workers in many factories have already learned many kinds of group dance. Because no one teaches them, workers in many factories are still unfamiliar with group dance. Guo Xipu from the Qinghe Woolen Mill said: "When we arrive at Tiananmen Square, we are like fools. Our arms and legs really want to move, but we don't know how to dance."

    Most people mentioned in their speeches that the Central Academy of Drama has recently sent a lot of people to factories, and some of them have effectively helped the literary and artistic activities of these factories. They expressed satisfaction. But on the one hand, they worried that after they left, the work would collapse again.

    Popularization and Improvement Issues

    Many of the situations, opinions and hopes that the comrades talked about involved the issue of popularization and improvement of literature and art. In the workers' literature and art issue, is the main task currently popularization or improvement? What is the relationship between them?

    In addition to the opinions already expressed in the above speeches, most comrades believe that the previous work of popularizing literature and art was not done well enough, so the work of improvement was not done well either. Qi Xinmin from the Chengzi Coal Mine said: "We should first engage in popularization, but after we write allegro, we want to write scripts, so we cannot forget improvement." Zhao Rui from the Shijingshan Power Plant said: "In our factory, the first thing is popularization, so that literature and art is popularized to all workers, and then we can improve from here. However, without popularization alone, there will be no great progress. Without improvement alone, there will be no foundation." Many comrades agree with the following sentence: "Let it exist where it doesn't exist, and let it be better where it exists." Popularization and improvement are inseparable.

    Many comrades pointed out that some people think that popularization work is amateur literary and artistic activities, which is a mistake. Literary and artistic workers going down to factories is itself a popularization work. Therefore, writers who go down to factories to experience life should also take on the task of cultivating worker writers and guiding workers' literary and artistic activities. Literary and artistic workers going down to factories to do literary and artistic popularization work will improve workers' literary and artistic activities, and at the same time, they will inevitably improve themselves. A worker comrade said: "If he only thinks about improving himself and forgets us, he will not be able to improve himself." (Attached picture)

    工人群众对文艺工作的意见和希望
    记本报和北京市总工会文教部联合举行的工人文艺座谈会
    毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年的前几天，本报和北京市总工会文教部联合邀请北京市区和郊区二十七个工厂矿山的六十二个文艺活动积极分子和工会文教干部举行座谈。出席的人在参加这个会议以前，都普遍地征求了本单位工人的意见。在座谈会上，他们积极负责地、热情地反映了工人群众对文艺工作的意见和希望。在几十个人的发言里，大家都认为：几年来文艺作品在表现工人方面是做得很不够的；专业文艺团体和文艺工作者为工人服务也做得不够好，他们还提出应该提高对工人群众的“文艺待遇”。座谈会还讨论了文艺工作者下厂的问题、文艺的普及和提高等问题。
    文艺要表现工人、面向工人
    石景山发电厂赵瑞说：“记得在北京市文联成立时，彭真同志指示我们说：‘文艺要面向工农兵，特别是产业工人。’可是，直到今天，面向工人的创作太少了，面向工人的演出太少了。”许多同志说：“歌子还是‘我们工人有力量’！”“表现工人的电影还只有‘桥’、‘光芒万丈’是受欢迎的。”“反映工人生活的小说、戏剧，长的短的都很少见。”
    工人同志都非常喜欢看连环画（小人书）。据一个矿的统计，他们一个月借出了八千本，平均每个月一个人要看好几本。但是这些画表现工人的太少了，而且那些表现工人的很多是歪曲工人形象的、粗糙的甚至是有害的。琉璃河水泥厂王朝臣说：
    “许多画工人的画，根本不是工人像，看着没劲。有劲也是硬画出来的，不是工人心里头的劲。”五四六工厂郭茂林说：“我看见‘学文化’上有一幅画，工人的脚踏在车床上，这完全是捏造。我们工人是爱护机器的。”门头沟京西矿区工会干部佟屏亚反映说：“煤矿工人歌”一开始就是“别看我们黑，别看我们脏……”煤矿工人一唱就说：“你看，他一做歌就先看见我们的黑和脏了！”
    京西矿区各厂工人都说，他们几乎始终没有看见过表现煤矿工人的作品。京西矿区工会干部马宁说：“作家们没有到矿区去看看，我们那里的反把头斗争、生产斗争是多么丰富动人哪！”城子煤矿李章说：“就说‘学文化’吧，我们天天瞧，天天瞧，就是没有我们的事。”
    关于文艺演出和其他文艺活动面向工人的问题，大家提出了很多意见。像“龙须沟”、“长征”、“保尔·柯察金”、“打击侵略者”这些好戏，城内的工人很难买到票，城外的根本没办法看到。有时预定了每张三千元的票，剧院给的都是五千、七千的。工人向票房交涉，票房的人说：“我们有决定权。”这样就只好七千的也看。可是有时连出高价也还是买不到票，因为一个戏演出，常常被机关包场，一包就两个月，工人很难买到票。郊区的工人同志就是连好电影也很难得进城看一次。像“抗美援朝”这样的大家渴望着看见的影片，在城内放映两个月以后放映队才到了京西矿区。石景山发电厂赵瑞说：“我们厂里有一部电影机，但是到华北影片经理公司去租片子，好像是到烧饼铺里买烧饼一样，
    一点也不照顾工人应当看什么片子。”他还说：“工人们都很爱看电影，不过，有些电影工人不容易看懂，也很少看到报纸、杂志刊载用通俗的笔法介绍影片的文章。”此外，他们认为电影租费对工厂来说还是太贵。
    京西矿区工会干部佟屏亚和城子煤矿齐新民都说：京西矿区有两万工人，没有电影院，只有一个小戏院，常常一个钟头票就买完了。戏剧节目也就是“棒打薄情郎”、“李三娘打水”之类。那些说书馆更严重地宣传着封建的有害的一些东西。工人下了班看看白牡丹、海棠红的戏吧，看完了说：“真逗”，这是不能解决工人的文化生活问题的。京西煤矿马宁说，工人一方面每天受两小时的共产主义教育，一方面却被这些封建思想的戏所毒害。城内各厂的工人也认为：虽然评戏的内容经过了很大的改革而且演出了不少新戏，如“小二黑结婚”“小女婿”等，在宣传婚姻法上，起了不少作用。但不少演员的表演还是不健康的不严肃的。相声也是这样。北京电信局曹亚力说：“有些相声，光耍贫嘴，甚至比耍贫嘴还坏。”
    工人们热烈欢迎专业文艺团体下厂演出。赵瑞说：“青年艺术剧院的同志到石景山发电厂演出过几次，工人同志常常让我捎话来，希望他们再去。”大家认为：专业文艺团体下厂演出还是太少了。特别是郊区，这种意见和要求是一致的。大家希望：专业文艺团体不要强调工厂演出条件不好就不愿意下厂演出了，这些困难是可以克服的。
    对工厂领导的意见
    没有文艺活动时间，是很多厂的共同困难。石景山钢铁厂和发电厂几乎是没有一点文艺活动的时间。石景山钢铁厂徐东园对他们厂的领导干部不关心、不重视工人文艺活动提出意见：“去年工厂领导上每次花几百万元请李万春、徐东明、新凤霞去厂内演戏，但是，对厂内文艺活动反而关心很少。剧团排戏没地方，要到工人家里去。剧团搞了一年多文艺活动，是有成绩的，但没有得到一次表扬。”北京被服厂平瑞芬说：“我们厂里一年没搞文艺活动了。‘三反’运动中，领导方面忽然想起文艺活动有用处，就号召我们突击。领导上对文艺活动不撑腰，要的时候抓一把，不要的时候就一推不管了。”
    领导重视是开展工人文艺活动的很重要的条件。琉璃河水泥厂的同志说：由于领导方面的重视，他们厂内的文艺活动有了新的开展。他们厂内的文艺活动已经普及到车间了，车间文艺小组在“三反”期间起了很好的作用。他们领导方面已经开始解决文艺活动的时间问题。文艺活动不是妨碍了生产，而是推动了生产的。
    对文艺工作者下厂的要求
    文艺干部下厂，就目前情况来说可以分为两方面。一是下厂体验生活——搞创作的，一是辅导文艺活动——帮助建立文艺组织、排戏、教歌、教舞等。大家一致认为：下厂的同志太少，时间太短了。北京市总工会文教部俱乐部工作科田耕说，据他们统计：一九五○年一年中下厂的文艺干部仅有六十五人（次），大部分是青年文艺工作者而且是短期的。工人同志们在这方面的意见是很多的，要求也是很多的。
    琉璃河水泥厂和其他很多厂的同志都认为：现在工厂文艺活动的主要困难是创作的问题。文艺工作者没有为工人创作出更多的更好的作品来，也没有很好地帮助工人去创作。
    许多下厂的同志，单纯搜集材料的观点是很严重的。电信局曹亚力说：
    “有些同志下厂来搜集材料，工人同志们最初也很热心地替他们搜集材料。但是，材料背走了，也没音讯了，工人心里也凉了。如果谁是抱着单纯搜集材料的观点下厂来，当然不会写出作品或好作品来。”这些同志，尽管下厂了，但还是脱离群众，脱离生活的。个别同志还采取了很恶劣的态度。城子煤矿齐新民说：“我们那里有一位下厂同志来搜集材料，他不联系群众，只是抓住一两个积极分子。他写东西的时候就抓住一个人陪着他，问一句写一句。‘这叫什么？’告诉他了，然后再问。有时一直问到下一点。到底他写什么，别人也不知道。”清河制呢厂周宏才曾要求一个下厂同志多到车间去，多团结群众，这位同志竟这样说：“我来的任务是创作，和工人团结得再好，没有创作也不行！”这些同志不愿意为工人服务，把帮助工人创作当做负担。许多同志说：“他们见了工人送来稿子就皱眉”，说工人的创作“枯燥无味”。工人希望他帮助写快板、曲艺，他说“不内行”，而且竟有人向工人同志说：“搞创作可不容易，苏联有一位作家，一本书写了四十年！”
    因为有些下厂同志不深入生活，不联系群众，对工人的理解就一定是错误的。琉璃河水泥厂王朝臣说：“有的下厂同志认为嘴里带脏字，学会了骂人，就可以联系工人了。这是对工人非常错误的看法。”宇文章说：“有一位青年同志下厂时，见了工人就说：‘工人太好了！’‘直爽’‘有优秀品质’等等，但是过了一两个月，这个同志的情绪就变了，嫌我们工人照顾他不够了。”清河制呢厂周宏才说：“有些人下厂光耍脾气，嫌舞台小，地方脏，甚至嫌饭不好。”他们说这样自己先和工人划了一道界线，怎么能和工人打成一片？
    文艺工作者下厂的很少，时间短，而且没有尽力去帮助工人。因此，作家、艺术家和工人的结合是很不够的。人民印刷厂周铁生就说：“我们写的东西，想送到市文联去，但又怕他们大文学家不给看。”他说：“我们厂里有许多工人喜欢写东西，但从来没有得到作家的帮助。”
    丰台地区铁路工会陈以福说：“我们希望作家们下厂来，不仅要体验生活、搜集材料，而且要帮助工人创作。”门头沟城子煤矿齐新民更热情地说：“作家同志说出我们的缺点来不要紧，我们就愿意知道错在那里。”许多同志提出：今后下厂同志应当把帮助工人创作当做自己的任务。
    关于怎样帮助工人创作的问题，电信局曹亚力说：“发现那一个厂的文艺工作搞得有成绩了再下去，那是不对的。有时来了一大群，还得我们派专人招待，成为负担。”曹亚力和其他很多同志都认为：一方面正是因为工人创作上有困难，才要普遍地去帮助；另一方面，过去有许多群众的好东西并没有被发现，而是被埋没了。大多数同志认为：作家要在运动中去发现和培养工人作家，如果离开斗争生活，不接触工人的创作实践，企图在以后去集中和概括一个什么好作品那是不可能的。
    在形式方面，许多同志都希望：专业团体多创作些短小精练的作品。城子煤矿齐新民说：“有些下厂同志看不起快板、曲艺这些小形式，一搞就是几幕几场的大戏。其实这并不符合工人的普遍要求。”人民印刷厂周铁生说：“文艺机关团体经常号召创作小戏，我们也希望多看到一些小戏，好当做学习的榜样，但专业团体一演就是大戏。”齐新民认为：这恐怕也是专业团体不能很好地配合政治运动的原因之一。他希望文艺工作者今后在这方面能满足工人的要求。
    关于工厂文艺的辅导工作
    大家都认为过去各工厂文艺辅导工作的主要的和严重的缺点是：文艺的根还没有深深地扎到工人群众中去；文艺这个武器还没有普遍地被工人所掌握。
    赵瑞说：“石景山发电厂曾经是文艺工作搞得很好的工厂，可是现在垮了！剧团的积极分子有的成为生产模范——生产的旗帜不能去演剧了，有的去学习了，有的调到团市委，有的调到工厂的党委会去，我自己还调做工会的文教委员，所有的干部连根拔了。就是因为走了一批，没有再培养一批，所以剧团垮了，歌咏队垮了，腰鼓队垮了——腰鼓放在仓库里长毛了！就是说：文艺的根没有扎深，开了一阵花就又谢了！”
    清河制呢厂周宏才谈了另外一个情况。他说：“三年来，我们是从不能写到能写了，从不能演到能演了，从不会唱到会唱了，有剧团，有歌咏队了。但是，这个水平，到半年以前，已经不能再向前发展。大家组织得很好，情绪很高，但是干瞪着眼。眼看着新事物那么多，但写不出来。”他说：“希望今后能注意到工人文艺工作的提高问题。”
    有的同志反映：他们厂子是辅导的人下去一次就火热一次，走了就消沉了。就是说：“离开拐棍走不了”，没有培养出工人自己的文艺干部来。
    表现工人的舞很少。工人们非常希望舞蹈工作者创作出适合工人的健壮有力的舞蹈来。专业文艺团体对集体舞不关心、不重视，因此也很少去研究、改编和创作。个别同志还认为和工人在一起跳集体舞有失舞蹈演员的身份。但是集体舞是广泛地被工人所喜欢的。有许多工厂的工人已经学会了不少种集体舞。有许多工厂因为没有人教，工人们对集体舞还是生疏的。清河制呢厂郭锡璞说：“我们到了天安门和傻子一样，胳膊、腿非常想活动，可就是不会跳。”
    多数人在发言中提到中央戏剧学院最近派了不少人下厂，其中有些同志切实帮助了这些厂的文艺活动，他们表示满意。但一方面又耽心他们走了之后，工作又会垮台。
    普及和提高问题
    很多同志谈的情况、意见和希望，都涉及了文艺的普及和提高的问题。在工人文艺问题中，目前主要是普及呢，还是提高呢？它们的关系是怎样的呢？
    对这个问题，除了以上发言中已经说过的意见以外，大多数同志的发言都认为以往文艺普及工作做得不够，因此提高的工作也做得不好。城子煤矿齐新民说：“应当首先搞普及，但是，我们写成了快板，就想写剧本，所以也不能忘记了提高。”石景山发电厂赵瑞说：“在我们厂里首先是普及，使文艺普及全体工人，然后才能从这里提高。但是，单普及就没有大进步，单提高就没有了基础。”许多同志都同意下面这句话：“没有的地方让它有，有的地方让它更好。”普及和提高是不可分割的。
    许多同志指出：有些人认为普及工作就是业余文艺活动，这是一种错误。文艺工作者下厂，本身就是普及工作。因此，下厂体验生活的作家，也要担负起培养工人作家、辅导工人文艺活动的任务。文艺工作者下厂做文艺普及工作，就提高了工人文艺活动，同时，也必然地提高了自己。有一位工人同志说：“如果他光想着提高自己，忘了我们，他也就提高不了自己。”（附图片）
