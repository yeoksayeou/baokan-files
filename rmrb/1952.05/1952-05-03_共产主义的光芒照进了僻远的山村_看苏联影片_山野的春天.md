The Soviet film "Spring in the Mountains" is adapted from Georgy Gulia's novel "Spring in Sagen," which won the Stalin Prize. Both the novel and the film are very appealing. The story and characters it depicts feel very familiar to Chinese readers and viewers, and the events seem to be happening in some remote village in China.

The film focuses on Sagen's efforts to increase land productivity, discover and use the natural apatite (fertilizer) produced in Sagen, and unfolds the entire story. Sagen is a place almost isolated from the world, surrounded by high mountains and ridges. Outsiders who want to go to Sagen must cross nine dangerous mountains and wade through eight large rivers. The road is difficult to travel, and one careless step can lead to destruction. Legend has it that the tax collectors of Tsarist Russia felt it was not worth risking their lives to go to Sagen to collect a few taxes, so they simply crossed out Sagen and its population from the village and household registers, saying: "From now on, let's just pretend this place doesn't exist in the world anymore!" But socialist Soviet Union did not forget it; it is an inseparable part of the entire Soviet Union, and the Bolshevik fighting spirit has also penetrated this mountain village, turning this backward, barren mountain village into a happy and joyful place.

The residents of Sagen advance together with the various ethnic groups of their great motherland. However, there are differences in the degree of progress among them, and these differences constitute the contradictions between them. Among them, there are not only people like Kesu, a Red Army veteran who participated in the Great Patriotic War, Gosdao, the vice chairman of the village Soviet and the secretary of the village Party branch, and Kama, a peasant girl, who are imbued with the spirit of socialism and fight for the collective interest, but also people like the small businessman Adamur and the loafer Anton, who are selfish, alcoholic, and lazy. They are as if they have been sleeping in Sagen for thirty years and are unaware that the times have changed. Their minds are still filled with the thoughts and morals of the old society. In addition, there are also villagers like Yegup, David, and old man Sanjieri, who is one hundred and fifty years old, who are close to the Party and the Soviets, but still retain conservative ideas. Under the education of the Party and reality, they finally moved forward together with everyone.

Because of the existence of these backward figures and conservative ideas, Sagen's collective farm inevitably encountered difficulties and obstacles on the road to abundant production. Among the collective farm members, a struggle between advanced and backward conservative ideas, a struggle between collectivism and individualism, and a struggle between socialist ideology and private property ideas were bound to unfold.

When the government's call for production arrived in the village, proposing to increase Sagen's yield per hectare from 1,600 kilograms to 8,000 kilograms, it immediately aroused suspicion and opposition. Even the chairman of the village Soviet, Nigao, believed that this call was a "troublesome document" for Sagen, because "Sagen's land is full of clay and stones," and he advocated developing pastures and organizing hunting. The members of the collective farm also discussed: "The land here is not good, even the grass doesn't grow well..." "Even 1,600 kilograms is only possible in a good year." "Sagen has never produced 8,000 kilograms."

"Never had it, never had it, Sagen's land is too bad..."

Aren't these conservative arguments also heard among some farmers in China? It is precisely this kind of conservative thinking that hinders people from moving forward like stumbling blocks. To move forward, we must first kick away these ideological "stones." Kesu waged a tenacious struggle against these ideas. He said: "It is precisely because of this kind of talk that everyone doesn't use their brains and insists that we can't do it well." He used the example of neighboring villages on the plains producing 24,000 kilograms per hectare to guide people to learn from advanced areas. He said: "We have defeated stubborn enemies, can't we even take care of the land... The whole country is moving forward, and Sagen cannot lag behind."

Kesu is a person who loves Sagen. After the Soviet Patriotic War, Kesu immediately returned to Sagen because he knew that Sagen needed him most. He wanted to turn that barren land into fertile soil and make the backward mountain village catch up with the advanced areas. He and Gosdao, the vice chairman of the village Soviet and the secretary of the village Party branch, firmly believed that Sagen could achieve a yield of 8,000 kilograms. Kesu not only placed his hope on deep plowing and careful cultivation, but more importantly, on solving the fertilizer problem. He led and supervised spring plowing with a highly responsible attitude, and tried his best to cultivate the land according to scientific methods. For those who did not cultivate according to standards, even his father, he never tolerated. He was even more unceremonious to the loafer Anton, who did not abide by labor discipline, was alcoholic, late, and claimed to have "leg cramps," "joint pain," and "back pain."

Because Kesu obtained a manuscript from a Russian scholar who had been treated for illness in Sagen and studied the "Mercy Cliff" that produced natural apatite in Sagen, he thought about that cliff every moment while fighting on the front line and studying in training classes. When he raised the issue of this cliff in the collective farm, some people doubted, some ridiculed him for "being crazy to grind the cliff into powder for the land," and some opposed him with the old set of empiricism. Although Kesu encountered difficulties everywhere, the Bolshevik fighting spirit made him never bow to any difficulties. The cause he loyally and diligently pursued was the cause of the collective, and he was by no means isolated and helpless. A group of young people in Sagen supported him, the Party supported him, and the entire Soviet Union supported him. Even among the leaders of the Sagen Collective Farm, an ideological struggle unfolded. Gosdao, the vice chairman of the village Soviet, criticized Nigao, the chairman of the village Soviet, for wrongly believing that "Sagen is not a place to create new records" and that "even if Sagen, this poor little place, creates a new record, it will not contribute to the entire Soviet national plan." He said: If all the collective farmers in the Soviet Union thought like you, wouldn't the entire Soviet national plan become a mere scrap of paper? Sagen, though small, is also included in the Soviet Union. The district committee secretary's speech to Kesu most powerfully illustrated this point:

"...Some people think that you live far away in Sagen, completely isolated from the outside world. Their thinking is wrong. The whole country stands with you completely, you are not alone. The Bolshevik spirit penetrates everywhere, mountains, gorges, rivers, everywhere." He said: "The Soviet Union is a great country in the world, and you are a member of it. Your life and work are like living and working in Moscow, beside Stalin." Kesu's work, life, and his thoughts and feelings are completely in line with these words. When he and his beloved girl Kama were dating under the moon, reminiscing about the Kremlin and missing Stalin, it made people imagine that he was indeed with Moscow and with Stalin. Recognizing that he is indeed an excellent Bolshevik. At the same time, he is by no means isolated. The entire Soviet Union is indeed supporting them. Agronomists were sent to Sagen, machines were transported to Sagen by plane, and the cliff that produced natural apatite was opened and crushed, bringing unprecedented harvests to Sagen. Isn't this the assistance of the motherland to them!

Here, the film shows a high degree of ideological nature. The film's director appropriately handled the relationship between the individual and the motherland, and between the part and the whole. Its education of people is profound. How kind and touching are the words of the district committee secretary to Kesu! These words are equally applicable to people who are far away from Beijing, far away from Chairman Mao, and working in remote areas and remote villages!

The film's portrayal of the struggle between socialist ideology and the remnants of capitalist private property concepts is very vivid. From the small businessman Adamur, we can see how the specter of capitalism is haunting him! When Adamur heard that Kesu was going to take the soil from "Mercy Cliff" to the city for testing to see if it contained apatite, he ran to Kesu's house to build kinship and reminisce about the past, saying that "his father said when he was alive that this cliff was not a stone mountain but a gold mountain," and instructed him to guard it. He also said that this cliff was in his territory and belonged to "our clan" for a period of time. Now that it has been discovered that the cliff is apatite, "a fortune should be made," and he should share this property equally with Kesu, hoping that Kesu would not "swallow it alone," and so on. Socialist Soviet Union has been established for more than thirty years, but this Adamur is still talking about dreams from more than thirty years ago. Although Kesu lives in the same era and lives in Sagen as him, how far apart are they! One is standing on the level of socialism, working selflessly for the collective interest; the other wants to make a fortune based on the private ownership of land that no longer exists and that he only barely touches. Kesu angrily criticized his private property concept: "I simply don't understand what you're talking about, saying such things in this era! Did you fall from the sky? Or did you come from America?" He said: "If my invention can be useful, isn't that good for our entire collective farm? Why only say you and me! You're probably still dreaming, only someone who has slept for thirty years would see things the way you do!"

For personal gain, in order to sabotage the cause of the collective farm that Kesu was engaged in, Adamur finally conspired with the loafer Anton to steal the cliff soil that Kesu was going to send to the city for testing; they also incited the shoemaker Lashite to follow the traditional customs of Sagen that had long been abolished, to rob the girl Kama, whom both Lashite and Kesu loved. Although Lashite is opposed to Kesu in love, he is not interested in Kesu's work to increase land production, but he does not hate Kesu in other matters. Lashite does not care about public affairs, but he does not damage them. What he cares about is his own love. Although Lashite, Adamur, and Anton often eat and drink together, Lashite is not a bad person. He is different from them. When he learned that Adamur had replaced the soil that Kesu sent to the city for testing, he scolded them for "being too immoral!" When he listened to Adamur and Anton and wanted to rob Kama, he finally changed his mind under Kama's education, and they successfully sent the real apatite to the city for testing.

This film clearly shows the tremendous steps that socialist Soviet Union is taking towards communism. Even in extremely remote places, like the mountain village of Sagen, the light of communism has shone in. In the socialist construction cause, people are not only transforming nature, but also constantly transforming themselves and constantly moving forward.

    共产主义的光芒照进了僻远的山村
    ——看苏联影片“山野的春天”
    叶遥
    苏联影片“山野的春天”是根据苏联荣获斯大林奖金的乔奇·古里耶的小说“萨根的春天”改编的。无论是小说或电影，都非常吸引人。它所描写的故事和人物，使中国的读者和观众看了感到很亲切，事件好像就发生在中国的某个偏远村庄里一样。
    影片以萨根提高土地生产量，发见和使用萨根出产的天然磷灰土（肥料）为焦点，展开了整个故事。萨根是个几乎与世隔绝的地方，四面八方都是高山峻岭，外地人要到萨根去，必须翻过九座险山，涉过八道大水，路很难走，一不小心就要粉身碎骨。传说沙皇俄罗斯的收税官觉得犯不着冒生命的危险到萨根去收几个税钱，就把萨根和萨根人口从村名册和户口册上给一笔勾消了，说：“从今以后就算世界上再没有这个地方了！”但社会主义的苏联，并没有把它忘记，它是整个苏联不可分割的一部分，布尔什维克的战斗精神也同样渗透到了这个山村，使这个落后的、贫瘠的山村变成了一个幸福和快乐的地方。
    萨根的居民，和他们伟大的祖国各族人民一起前进。不过，他们各人的进步是有程度上的差别的，这种差别构成了他们之间的矛盾。他们中间不但有着像参加过卫国战争的退伍红军凯苏、村苏维埃副主席、村党支部书记高斯道和农女卡玛等浸透着社会主义精神，为集体利益而战斗的人，也有着像小商人阿达穆尔和二流子安东那样的人，自私，酗酒，懒惰。他们像在萨根睡了三十年，而不知时代已经变了。他们满脑子还装着旧社会的思想和道德。此外，还有农庄庄员叶古普、达维得和那活了一百五十岁的善杰立老汉等，他们靠拢着党，靠拢着苏维埃，但是，他们身上还存留着保守思想。在党和现实的教育下，他们终于和大家一起前进了。
    由于这些落后人物和保守思想的存在，萨根的集体农庄要走向丰产的道路，就必然遭遇到困难和阻碍，在集体农庄庄员之中就不能不展开先进思想和落后保守思想的斗争；不能不展开集体主义和个人主义的斗争；不能不展开社会主义思想和私有财产思想的斗争。
    当政府号召生产的公文一到村里，提出萨根每公顷的产量要从一千六百公斤，提高到八千公斤时，立刻引起了人们的怀疑和反对。连村苏维埃主席尼高都认为这个号召是给萨根“找麻烦的公文”，因为
    “萨根的地尽是黏土和石头”，他主张搞牧场，组织打猎。集体农庄的庄员们也纷纷议论：“这里地不好，就是连青草都不好好长啊……”“就是一千六，还得好年成。”“萨根从来没有打过八千公斤。”
    “没有过，从来没有过，萨根的地太坏啦……”
    这些保守思想的论调，我们不是在中国的某些农民中间，也可以听到的？正是这种保守思想，像绊脚的石头一样阻碍着人们前进。要想前进，首先就必须把这些思想“石头”踢开。凯苏和这些思想进行了顽强的斗争。他说：“正因为有了这样的说法，所以，大家都不去动脑筋，硬说咱们一定做不好。”他拿平原邻近村每公顷丰产二万四千公斤做例子，去引导人们向先进地区看齐。他说：“顽强的敌人都叫我们给打败啦，难道我们连地就侍候不好……全国都在前进，萨根也就不能落后。”
    凯苏是一个热爱萨根的人。凯苏在苏联卫国战争后，就马上回到萨根，因为他知道萨根最需要他，他要把那块瘦脊的土地变成富饶的沃田，使落后的山村，赶上先进区。他和村苏维埃副主席、村党支部书记高斯道是坚信萨根能达到八千公斤的产量的。凯苏不但把希望放在深耕细作上，而且更重要的是放在解决肥料问题上。他以高度认真负责的态度去领导和监督春耕，竭力按照科学的方法去耕作土地。对于不按标准耕作的人，就是他的父亲，他也从不宽容。对于不遵守劳动纪律，酗酒，迟到，声称
    “腿肚子抽筋”“关节痛”“腰酸”的二流子安东，他更毫不客气。
    凯苏因为得到一个曾经在萨根养病、研究过萨根那个产天然磷灰土的“慈悲崖”的俄国学者的手稿，他在前线打仗，在训练班学习，每时每刻都想着那个山崖。当他把这个山崖的问题，提到集体农庄里来时，有人怀疑，有人讥笑他“想把山崖捣成粉来上地是疯啦”，有人拿出经验主义的老一套来反对他。凯苏虽然处处遇到困难，但布尔什维克的战斗精神，使他不向任何困难低头。他所忠心耿耿努力追求的事业是集体的事业，他决不是孤立无援的。萨根的一班青年人拥护他，党在支持他，全苏联都在支持他。就在萨根集体农庄领导人之间，也展开了思想斗争。村苏维埃副主席高斯道批评了村苏维埃主席尼高错误地认为：“萨根不是创造新纪录的地方”，“萨根这个可怜的小地方，就是创造出新纪录来，对整个苏联的国家计划也没有什么贡献”。他说：如果苏联所有的集体农民都像你那样想法，整个苏联的国家计划不是成为一纸空文了吗？萨根虽小，也包括在苏联之内。区委书记对凯苏的一段谈话最有力地说明了这一点：
    “……有些人认为你们远居萨根，跟外界完全隔绝。他们的想法是错的。全国完全跟你们站在一起，你们并不孤单。布尔什维克的精神是渗透各处的，高山，峡道，江河，到处渗透。”他说：“苏联是世界上一个伟大的国家，你们是里边的一员。你们的生活，工作，就好像在莫斯科，在斯大林身边生活和工作一样。”凯苏的工作，生活，他的思想感情是完全符合这些话的。他和他热爱的姑娘卡玛，在月下约会时，回忆着克里姆林宫和思念着斯大林的情景，使人想像到他的确是和莫斯科，和斯大林在一起。认识到他的确是个优秀的布尔什维克。同时，他决不是孤立的。全苏维埃也的确在支持他们。农学家被派到萨根来，用飞机运送机器到萨根，把那座产天然磷灰土的山崖凿开来捣碎，给萨根带来了空前的丰收。这不是祖国对他们的援助是什么！
    在这里，表现了影片的高度思想性。影片编导恰当地处理了个人和祖国、部分和整体的关系。它对人的教育是深刻的。区委书记给凯苏讲的那段话是多么亲切和感动人啊！这些话，也同样适用于讲给远离北京，远离毛主席，在边远地区、偏僻乡村工作着的人们！
    影片中表现社会主义思想和残余的资本主义的私有财产观念的斗争，是很生动的。从小商人阿达穆尔身上我们可以看出资本主义的幽灵是如何缠绕着他！阿达穆尔听说凯苏要拿“慈悲崖”的土去城里化验，看是否含有磷灰土时，他跑到凯苏家里攀亲叙旧，并说什么“他父亲在世的时候，就说这山崖不是石山是金山”，嘱咐他看守着它。又说这座山崖是在他的地界里，有一时期是属于“我们这一族的”。现在发见山崖是磷灰土，“该发一笔大财啦”，他该和凯苏平分这笔财产，希望凯苏不要
    “独吞掉”等等。社会主义的苏联，已经建立三十多年了，这位阿达穆尔，却在说着三十多年前的梦话。凯苏虽然和他同活在一个时代，同住在萨根，但他们距离得是多么远啊！一个是站在社会主义的水平上，为了集体利益而奋不顾身地工作；一个却想依据那早已不存在的，他仅仅沾上点边的土地私有权发一笔横财。凯苏气愤地批判了他的这种私有观念：“我简直不懂你说些什么，在这个时代里，说出这样的话来！你是从天上掉下来的？还是从美国来的？”他说：“如果我的发明能够有用，这不是对咱们全农庄都好吗？为什么单说你和我！你大概还在做梦吧，只有睡了三十年的人，才会像你这样看问题！”
    为了私利，为了破坏凯苏所从事的集体农庄的事业，阿达穆尔终于和二流子安东合谋把凯苏要送到城里化验的山崖土给偷换了；他俩并怂恿皮鞋匠拉希特，因袭萨根早已废除的传统风俗，去抢拉希特和凯苏都热爱着的姑娘卡玛。拉希特虽然在爱情上和凯苏是对立的，他也对凯苏所搞的提高土地产量工作不感兴趣，但他在其他事情上并不仇视凯苏。拉希特不关心公共的事业，但他也不去损坏他。他关心的是自己的爱情。拉希特和阿达穆尔、安东虽然常在一起吃喝，但拉希特不是一个坏人。他和他们有所不同。当他知道阿达穆尔换掉了凯苏送城里化验的土时，他骂他们“太缺德啦！”当他听信了阿达穆尔和安东的话，想去抢卡玛时，又终于在卡玛的教育下，转变过来，他们把真正的磷灰土送到城里去化验成功了。
    这部影片它清楚地使人看到社会主义的苏联是以怎样巨大的步伐在向共产主义迈进。即使是极偏僻的地方，像萨根那样的山村，也照进了共产主义的光芒。人们在社会主义的建设事业中不但改造了自然，而且也不断地改造自己，不断地前进着。
