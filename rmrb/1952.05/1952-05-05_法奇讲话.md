    Commemorating Avicenna, Da Vinci, Hugo, and Gogol
    Faqi's Speech
    Mr. Chairman:
    Dear friends:
    First, I should fulfill a mission. Before I set off for China, the French National Peace Council convened a meeting of representatives from various provinces. They entrusted me to convey to you a letter of respect to the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, which was unanimously approved with prolonged and enthusiastic applause at the meeting:
    "The French National Peace Council, meeting in Paris on April 19th and 20th, 1952, decided to entrust its chairman, Mr. Yves Farge, to bring the sincere friendship and deep solidarity of the French people to the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China.
    Yes, the French people are aware of China's remarkable contribution to human culture and enthusiastically watch the new China establish a system of its own choice within its own territory, while at the same time dedicating itself to defending peace internationally.
    These efforts of the Chinese people are a strong guarantee for all Asian nations, ensuring that the cultures of Asian nations will be respected, and their struggle for national autonomy will ultimately achieve complete victory.
    At present, the particularly serious nature of all political attempts to undermine the interests of these nations and lead to a full-scale war for selfish interests is becoming increasingly exposed.
    In fact, in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, wars are raging fiercely, and even provocations against China are becoming frequent. The most heinous methods of warfare are also being used. The world has been shaken by the news of the American military's use of bacteriological weapons.
    When the French government reaffirms its intention to continue the cruel war in Vietnam and participate in the aggressive war in Korea, as well as all the horrors caused by the war, the French National Peace Council is convinced that it can express the will of the people, condemn this policy of the French government, and oppose France's participation in this shameful conspiracy.
    The French National Peace Council will continue to fight tirelessly to eliminate these wars. The weapons being tested in Asia during the war may spread disaster throughout the world tomorrow.
    The French National Peace Council entrusts its chairman, Mr. Yves Farge, to express to the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression that France is willing to see the re-establishment of the traditional diplomatic and cultural relations inherent to both China and France. At the same time, regarding the restoration of economic relations, the recent International Economic Conference in Moscow has pointed out its possibilities and advantages.
    The French National Peace Council has decided to continue to strengthen its actions to strive for the signing of a five-power peace pact including the People's Republic of China, and to fight for negotiated disarmament and the victory of peace in all circumstances."
    I am proud to bring this letter, and I believe it can express our common thoughts and our common will.
    The strength of the world peace movement is expressed in the following simple words: friendship, honesty, justice, labor, freedom, and peace. These words are often on the lips of every good person, and these words can often be seen in the works of the great people we commemorate today, or their works are inspired by these words.
    Just as the United States is talking loudly about war, inciting hatred, building barriers between the people of various countries, encouraging corruption, using threats, and forcing science to prepare for the mass slaughter of humanity; we are very pleased and full of confidence to see that in liberated China, the people, schools, and cultural figures unanimously express great respect to Avicenna, Da Vinci, Gogol, and Hugo.
    I am very grateful to the great Chinese writer Mao Dun for proposing at the World Peace Council to hold an international commemorative meeting for our genius Hugo. Therefore, on behalf of the French people, I express my heartfelt thanks to you.
    Thanks to Mr. Mao Dun's proposal, a Frenchman brought to your capital a powerful letter written by Hugo to the United States on December 2, 1859. At that time, John Brown was convicted by American judges for advocating the liberation of slaves. In his letter, Hugo said: "In the face of the civilized world, it is impossible to do such a thing with impunity. The wishes of the people of the world are very clear. The United States should know and consider: There is something more terrible than Cain killing Abel, that is, Washington is strangling Spartacus." (Note: Spartacus was the leader of the slave uprising, who was killed in 71 BC, and his name symbolizes the oppressed who demanded liberation.) When we know that the United States is committing serious crimes in Korea and Northeast China, we re-emphasize Hugo's stern warning.
    Dear friends! Hugo, Gogol, Da Vinci, and Avicenna belong to all of humanity. They have given resistance, wisdom, plans, and weapons to the people of the world.
    As we gather here to commemorate them, we pay tribute to all the people around the world who are united for creation and for struggle, sharing weal and woe!
    A friendly salute to the Chinese people!
    A fraternal salute to the people of the world!
    A supreme salute to the four glorious figures of mankind! (Attached image)

    纪念阿维森纳、达·芬奇、雨果、果戈理
    法奇讲话
    主席先生：
    亲爱的朋友们：
    首先我应该完成一个使命。在我动身来中国以前，法国全国和平理事会曾经召集各省的代表们开了一个会，他们委托我向诸位宣读会中长时间热烈鼓掌一致通过的一封向中国人民及中华人民共和国政府致敬的信：
    “法国全国和平理事会于一九五二年四月十九、二十两日在巴黎举行会议，决定委托它的主席伊维斯·法奇先生把法国人民的真挚友谊和休戚相关的深情带给中国人民和中华人民共和国政府。
    是的，法国人民晓得中国对于人类文化惊人的贡献，热情地注视着新中国在国内领土之上建立一个自己选择的制度，同时在国际上致力于保卫和平。
    中国人民的这些努力，对于整个亚洲各民族，是
    一个坚强的保证，保证亚洲各民族文化将受到人们的尊重，他们的争取民族自主权最后一定会获得完全的胜利。
    目前为一己的自私的利益打算，企图破坏这些民族的利益引到全面的战争，这一切政治上的企图的特别严重性越来越暴露出来了。
    事实上在朝鲜，越南，马来亚，战争正疯狂地展开，甚至于侵犯中国的挑衅也频繁起来。最恶劣的战争方法也被使用起来。美国军队已经使用细菌武器的新闻公布之后，全世界都震动起来了。
    当法国政府重新肯定它的意图要继续越南的残酷战争，并参加朝鲜的侵略战争，也参加战争所引起的一切恐怖行为的时候，法国全国和平理事会确信能表达人民的意志，谴责法国政府这种政策，并反对法国参加这个可耻的同谋。
    法国全国和平理事会为了消灭这些战争将继续不断的斗争。在战争过程中，那些在亚洲正试用的武器，明天可能在全世界散布灾祸。
    法国全国和平理事会委托它的主席，伊维斯·法奇先生向中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会表示，法国愿意看见中法两国共同所固有的传统的外交关系，文化关系重新建立起来。同时说到恢复经济关系，在最近莫斯科举行的国际经济会议中已经指出它的可能性和优点。
    法国全国和平理事会已经决定继续加强它的行动，争取签订包括中华人民共和国在内的五大国和平公约，并在任何情况下为协商裁军、和平获得胜利而奋斗。”
    我骄傲地带来这封信，我相信能表达我们共同的思想，和我们的共同意志。
    全世界和平运动的力量在下面的几个简单的词汇中表达出来了，那就是：友谊、诚实、正义、劳动、自由与和平。这些词汇是每一个善良的人不离口的，这些词汇在今天我们所纪念的伟人们的作品里，时常可以看到的。或者他们的作品从这些词汇中得到了启发。
    正当美国高谈战争，煽动仇恨，在各国人民中间筑起壁垒，鼓励贪污，使用威胁，迫使科学来准备大规模屠杀人类的时候；我们在解放了的中国，看到人民、学校和文化人士一致向阿维森纳、达·芬奇、果戈理和雨果表示伟大的敬意，使我们非常愉快并充满了信心。
    我非常感激中国的伟大作家茅盾在世界和平理事会上提议要为我们的天才的雨果举行国际性的纪念会。因此，我代表法国人民在你们的面前，向你们表示衷心的谢意。
    由于茅盾先生的提议，才有一个法国人把雨果在一八五九年十二月二日写给美国一封强有力的信，带到你们的首都来。那时候约翰勃朗为了宣扬解放奴隶，被美国的法官判了罪。雨果在他的信中说道：“在文明的世界面前，作这样的事是不可能不受惩罚的，全世界人民的愿望是看得很清楚的。美国应当知道并且加以考虑：还有比卡安杀害阿尔伯更可怕的事情，那就是华盛顿正扼杀斯巴达古斯。”（注：斯巴达古斯是领导奴隶起义的领袖，于纪元前七十一年被害，他的名字象征着要求解放的被压迫者。）当我们晓得美国在朝鲜和中国东北正在进行严重的罪行的时候，我们把雨果的严厉的警告重新提出来了。
    亲爱的朋友们！雨果、果戈理、达·芬奇、阿维森纳是全世界人类所共有的。他们把反抗、智慧、计划和武器交给全世界的人民。
    当我们在这里聚会来纪念他们的时候，我们向全世界那些为了创造、为了斗争而团结在一起、患难相共的人民致敬！    
    向中国人民致友谊的敬礼！
    向全世界人民致兄弟般的敬礼！
    向人类光荣的四大名人致崇高的敬礼！（附图片）
