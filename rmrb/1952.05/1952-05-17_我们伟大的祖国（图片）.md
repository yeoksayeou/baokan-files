    Tianjin bricklayer Fu Hongbin's "cyclic bricklaying method" is a further development of Su Changyou's "segmented bricklaying method."

This is a scene of him demonstrating the "cyclic bricklaying method" in public at the advanced work method experiment conference held by the Tianjin Construction Trade Union.
