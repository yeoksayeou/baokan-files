Unite the Masses, Overcome Difficulties, and Continue to Advance
    —Visiting Guo Qingsi, a Labor Model from Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangxi
    Labor model Guo Qingsi is a hand-pick coal miner at the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine. On November 30th of last year, he improved the coal mining method and created a new national record for hand-pick coal mining. In one shift (eight hours), Guo Qingsi mined 79 tons of coal, which was six times higher than the general hand-pick coal mining efficiency at Pingxiang Coal Mine at the time, and exceeded the wind-pick coal mining efficiency for medium-thick coal seams stipulated by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry by 60 percent. Guo Qingsi's coal mining method created useful experience for improving efficiency, improving operating methods, and rationally organizing labor in coal mines with relatively backward equipment. This year on the "May 1st" Labor Day, Guo Qingsi was honorably invited to Beijing by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend the celebrations.
    Whenever people ask him about his experience in creating the new record, Guo Qingsi always earnestly says: "Unity is strength! Without the unity and mutual assistance of all the workers, both skilled and unskilled, in our team, I would not have been able to create any new records." When I visited him, he repeatedly emphasized this point.
    Although the Longhu Mine where Guo Qingsi works adopted the new long-arm coal mining method in January of last year, due to equipment limitations, most workers still use hand picks to mine coal, and the coal mining efficiency cannot be effectively improved. At that time, each hand-pick coal miner was confined to a small area of three meters long (commonly called one "prop set") to mine coal, and there was no division of labor between coal miners and support workers. When mining coal, coal haulers could not haul coal; when hauling coal, coal miners had to stop mining. Idle work was serious, and coal mining efficiency was very low. If the coal seam was relatively soft, only two "prop sets" could be mined per day per worker. Guo Qingsi was determined to improve the coal mining work methods in order to improve efficiency. After repeated research, and drawing on the experience of wind-pick coal mining, he finally came up with a method. Guo Qingsi's method was to change the old method of mining coal in one prop set. At the beginning of work, he would cut a groove in the lower waist of a 36-meter-long working face (about twelve "prop sets"), leaving most of the upper coal seam suspended. Due to the pressure of the roof, the coal seam would become loose. Then, he would sequentially mine the upper and lower parts of the coal. Because the coal was soft, it was much faster to mine than in the past. At the same time, coal haulers and support workers (there was a clear division of labor between support workers and coal miners) could follow in sequence to erect supports and haul coal, eliminating the idle waiting phenomenon. In this way, Guo Qingsi mined twelve "prop sets" of coal in one shift. However, things were not so smooth in practice. Because of this, coal haulers and support workers would have to do a lot more work than in the past, which they were unwilling to do. Although they were paid on a piecework basis, and doing more work would mean more pay, they were afraid of increased quotas. At the same time, they did not believe in Guo Qingsi's method. With the help of the Party, the trade union, and the Youth League, and through practical labor experience, Guo Qingsi understood that without the support and assistance of the masses, his method would only be a "method" and would not achieve much. Guo Qingsi not only understood that he must rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, but also understood that mobilizing the masses was a meticulous and arduous task. He could not be impatient and could not expect the masses to fully accept a new thing all at once. He adopted a combination of political enlightenment and practical education to guide the masses to accept his opinions. He put forward his new working method at the team meeting and repeatedly explained it to the masses. At the same time, he used his own personal experience to inspire the political enthusiasm of the masses. He told everyone how his brother was caught by the Japanese imperialists and trampled to death with big leather shoes, and how he himself ran around trying to avoid being conscripted, and how his family could not get enough to eat or wear; while now life was getting better every day, not only were they eating and dressing well, but they also had the opportunity to study and watch movies. The workers were truly the masters of their own affairs. As long as they worked hard to build the country well and supported the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, their lives would be even better. The enthusiasm of the workers was raised. However, they were not completely and immediately convinced by Guo Qingsi's method. Guo Qingsi said: "At that time, eight out of the nine people in the team did not believe in my method. If I had started by mining twelve 'prop sets' of coal all at once, wouldn't that have been bureaucracy? And if the support and coal hauling couldn't keep up, I wouldn't be able to mine twelve prop sets either!" So, Guo Qingsi gradually increased from mining two prop sets to four prop sets, six prop sets, eight prop sets... The actual operation changed the workers' views; everyone recognized the benefits of the new working method, and also believed that mining twelve "prop sets" of coal was possible. With the continuous education of the Party and the trade union to the workers, Guo Qingsi's team finally united and created the new national record of mining twelve "prop sets" (i.e., 79 tons) of coal.
    Guo Qingsi said that this time when he came to Beijing, he listened to the reports of many leaders, and also exchanged experiences with labor models from many fraternal countries. He deeply realized the importance of uniting and relying on the masses. Now Pingxiang Coal Mine still has many difficulties, and the equipment is relatively backward. Like Guo Qingsi's group, they still use hand picks to mine the hardest special-grade coal seams. Therefore, he is determined that after returning this time, he will not only unite his own team and group, but also unite the entire mine. Everyone will work together to improve technology, increase efficiency, successfully complete this year's increase production and practice economy tasks, and strive for the early mechanization of Pingxiang Coal Mine.

    团结群众，克服困难，继续前进
    ——访问江西萍乡煤矿劳动模范郭清四
    劳动模范郭清四是国营萍乡煤矿的手镐采煤工人。去年十一月三十日，他改进了采煤方法，创造了手镐采煤的全国新纪录。在一班的时间（八小时）内，郭清四采煤七十九吨，比当时萍乡煤矿一般手镐采煤的效率提高了六倍，超过了中央燃料工业部规定的中厚煤层风镐采煤效率的百分之六十。郭清四的采煤方法，为在设备比较落后的煤矿提高效率、改进操作方法、合理地组织劳动力创造了有益的经验。今年“五一”劳动节，郭清四光荣地被全国总工会邀请到北京观礼。
    每当人们问起他创造新纪录的经验时，郭清四总是那么认真地讲：“团结就是力量！没有我们全班大工、小工的团结互助，我是创造不出什么新纪录的。”当我访问他时，他同样再三地重复着这一句话。
    郭清四所在的龙虎矿虽然去年一月起就采用了新式的长臂式采煤法。但是，由于设备的限制，大多数工人仍然使用手镐采煤，采煤效率不能有效地提高。当时，每个手镐采煤工人总是局限在三公尺长（普通叫一架“棚子”）的狭小范围内采煤，采煤工和支柱工也没有分工，采煤时，拖煤工不能拖煤；拖煤时，采煤工又得停止采煤。窝工现象严重，采煤效率很低。如果煤层较软，每工一天也才能采两架“棚子”。郭清四下决心要改进采煤工作方法，以便提高效率。经过反复研究，并且吸取了风镐采煤的经验，他终于想出了办法。郭清四的办法是：改变在一架棚子里采煤的老办法，工作一开始，他就在三十六公尺长的工作面（约十二架“棚子”）靠下的腰部拉一道槽口，使上面大半部煤层孤悬。由于顶板的压力，煤层就变松了。然后，他再顺序采上半部的煤和下半部的煤。因为煤质松软，采起来就比过去快得多了。同时，拖煤工和支柱工（支柱工和采煤工有了明确的分工）就可以顺次跟着支棚子、拖煤，消灭了彼此等待的窝工现象。这样，郭清四在一个班的时间内就采完了十二架“棚子”的煤。但是，事情做起来却并不是这么顺利。因为，这样，拖煤工和支柱工都要比过去多做很多活，大家不愿意。虽然，他们是计件工资，多做活可以多得工资，但是，他们怕定额提高。同时，他们也不相信郭清四的办法。在党、工会和青年团的帮助下，加上实际劳动中的体验，郭清四懂得，没有群众的支持协助，他的办法终归不过是一个“办法”而已，做不出什么成绩来。郭清四不仅懂得必须依靠群众，发动群众，并且懂得发动群众是一件细致艰苦的工作，不能性急，不能要求群众一下子就都能完全接受一件新东西。他采取了政治启发和实际教育结合的办法来诱导群众接受他的意见。他在班的会议上提出了自己的新工作方法，反复向群众解释。同时用他自己亲身的经历来启发群众的政治热情。他告诉大家：在日本帝国主义统治时，他的哥哥怎样被日本人捉去活活用大皮鞋踩死，他自己怎样因为“躲壮丁”而东奔西跑，一家人怎样吃不饱穿不暖等；而现在的生活则是一天比一天好，不但吃得饱穿得暖，而且有机会读书、看电影了。工人们是真当了家作了主了。只要努力生产，把国家建设好，支持抗美援朝胜利了，生活还要过得更好。工人们热情提高了。但是，他们还不是完全立刻就能相信郭清四的办法。郭清四说：“那时一班九个人中有八个人还没有相信我的办法，我要是开始一下子就要采十二‘棚子’煤，那不是官僚主义了吗？而且支柱和拖煤的赶不上，我也采不完十二棚子呀！”于是，郭清四就由过去的采两棚逐渐增加为采四棚、采六棚、采八棚……。实际的操作转变了工人们的看法；大家认识了新的工作方法的好处，也相信采十二“棚子”煤是可能的了。加上党和工会对工人不断地教育，郭清四班终于团结一致，创造了采十二“棚子”（即七十九吨）煤的全国新纪录。
    郭清四说，他这一次到北京来，听了许多首长的报告，又和许多兄弟国家的劳动模范交流了经验，他更深切地体会到团结群众依靠群众的重要。现在萍乡煤矿的困难还很多，设备比较落后，像郭清四的小组现在采最硬的特等煤层，也还是用手镐。因而，他下了决心，这次回去以后，不但要团结好自己的班和组，还要团结好整个矿，大家一致努力，改进技术，提高效率，胜利完成今年的增产节约任务，争取萍乡煤矿早日机械化。（宋琤）（附图片）
