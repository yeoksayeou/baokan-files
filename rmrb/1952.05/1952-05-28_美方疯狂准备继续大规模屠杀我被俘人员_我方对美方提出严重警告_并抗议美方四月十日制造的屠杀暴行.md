Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 27th: At the plenary session of the delegation of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 27th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, lodged a serious protest with the other side regarding the bloody incident on April 10th in which the US side massacred our captured personnel, killing and wounding more than 60 people. General Nam Il issued a serious warning regarding the US side's frantic preparations to continue the large-scale massacre of our captured personnel. General Nam Il pointed out that the other side, after suggesting a three-day recess, still insisted on the attempt to detain our captured personnel, which had been resolutely rejected by our side, once again proving that the other side deliberately delayed the armistice negotiations. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will never tolerate any attempt to detain our captured personnel under any name. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will never sit idly by and watch their comrades suffer arbitrary massacres by the US side. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

Regarding the massacre on April 10th in which your side killed and wounded more than 60 of our captured personnel, I am ordered to lodge a serious protest with your side. Your side attempted to cover up this serious massacre, imposing a news blackout for as long as forty-four days, attempting to prevent the world from seeing through your forced screening and the truth about using violence to detain our captured personnel. But the bloody facts cannot be covered up. On February 18th, your side killed and wounded more than 200 of our captured personnel. On March 13th, your side killed and wounded more than 30 of our captured personnel. On May 20th, your side killed and wounded more than 80 of our captured personnel. How much evil your side has created in order to forcibly detain our captured personnel is still not fully known. But these already disclosed massacres have irrefutably proved that your so-called "voluntary repatriation" is using all barbaric methods, not hesitating to resort to massacre to detain our captured personnel. Our side absolutely cannot tolerate your side detaining our captured personnel under any name, especially the barbaric massacres your side is carrying out in order to detain our captured personnel. The demands made by our captured personnel on Geoje Island to your side's prisoner-of-war camp commanders are completely legitimate and in accordance with the Geneva Convention. Your side not only broke faith and tore up the solemn promises made by your prisoner-of-war camp commanders to our captured personnel, but also openly declared that another large-scale massacre would be carried out against our captured personnel. Your side is mobilizing heavy troops and creating all kinds of absurd excuses to facilitate your massacres. I seriously warn your side: our unarmed captured personnel are under your custody, and your side must bear full absolute responsibility for any new atrocities and massacres. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers will never sit idly by and allow their captured comrades to be arbitrarily massacred by your side. For the shameful purpose of detaining our captured personnel, your side has already committed unforgivable crimes. For this shameful purpose, your side is also prepared to abandon the Korean armistice. The peace-loving people of the world cannot forgive you. For the sake of the Korean armistice, your side must abandon the lawless claim to detain our captured personnel.

    美方疯狂准备继续大规模屠杀我被俘人员
    我方对美方提出严重警告
    并抗议美方四月十日制造的屠杀暴行
    【新华社开城二十七日电】二十七日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军就四月十日美方屠杀我被俘人员，杀伤六十余名的血腥事件，向对方提出严重抗议。对于美方疯狂准备继续大规模地屠杀我被俘人员，南日将军提出严重警告。南日将军指出：对方在建议休会三天后仍然坚持早为我方所断然拒绝的企图扣留我方被俘人员的主张，再一次证实了对方蓄意拖延停战谈判。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军绝不能容忍以任何名义扣留我方被俘人员的企图。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军决不能坐视他们的战友遭受美方恣意屠杀。南日将军主要发言如下：
    对四月十日你方杀伤我方被俘人员六十余名的大屠杀，我奉命向你方提出严重抗议。你方企图一手掩盖此次严重屠杀事件，实行新闻封锁达四十四天之久，企图不让世人识破你方进行强迫甄别，使用暴力扣留我方被俘人员的真相。但血的事实是不能掩盖的。你方在二月十八日杀伤我方被俘人员二百余名，你方在三月十三日杀伤我方被俘人员三十余名，你方在五月二十日又杀伤我方被俘人员八十余名。你方为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员，究竟造成了多少罪恶，现在还不能全部知道。但这些已经公开的屠杀事件，就已经不可动摇地证明：你方的所谓“自愿遣返”，就是用一切野蛮办法，不惜采取屠杀手段扣留我方被俘人员。我方绝对不能容忍你方假借任何名义扣留我方被俘人员，尤其不能容忍你方为了扣留我方被俘人员所进行的野蛮屠杀。巨济岛我方被俘人员向你方战俘营长官所提出的要求，是完全正当的，符合日内瓦公约的。你方不仅背信弃义撕毁你方战俘营长官对我方被俘人员庄严的诺言，而且公开声称要对我方被俘人员施行又一次的大屠杀。你方正在调集重兵，制造各种便于你方进行屠杀的荒谬藉口。我严重警告你方：手无寸铁的我方被俘人员，是在你方的收容之下，你方必须对任何新的暴行和屠杀行为负全部的绝对的责任。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军决不能坐视他们的被俘的战友，听随你方任意屠杀。为了扣留我方被俘人员的可耻目的，你方已经犯了不可饶恕的罪恶。为了这个可耻的目的，你方还准备不要朝鲜停战。全世界爱好和平的人民是不能宽恕你们的。为了朝鲜的停战，你方必须放弃扣留我方被俘人员的无法无天的主张。
