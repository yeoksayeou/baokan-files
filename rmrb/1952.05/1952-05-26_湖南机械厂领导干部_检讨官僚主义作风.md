    Hunan Machinery Factory Leading Cadres
    Conduct Self-Criticism of Bureaucratic Work Style
    Editor: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on February 8th criticizing the serious phenomenon of excessive rework and scrap at our factory. We believe this criticism is correct and we accept it ideologically.

    Our bureaucratic work style is indeed serious. We lacked a sense of ownership in our work. We treated the people's enterprise with an irresponsible "do one day's work as a monk, strike the bell for one day" attitude. We did not delve into the worksite, nor did we listen to the opinions of the masses. We simply issued orders from above and carelessly passed down tasks. When workers worked overtime, responsible cadres from the production section rarely visited them. From September to December 1951, the average scrap rate for foundry workers was 6.39 percent. We did not pay attention to such a serious problem. We always thought that rework and scrap in the foundry were unavoidable. We mistakenly believed that even advanced countries had scrap, so how could our factory avoid it? This kind of unambitious thinking is extremely wrong.

    In order to eliminate the phenomenon of rework and scrap, we carried out the following work: (1) We held an exhibition of rework and scrap, listing the detailed losses in charts and exhibiting large pieces of scrap in a concentrated manner; (2) We established a monthly statistical and reporting system for rework and scrap. Through this education, we have all become vigilant. Now, the rework and scrap rate in our factory's foundry has been greatly reduced. The scrap rate in January was 5.2 percent, and in February it was only 4.2 percent. We should make further efforts and are determined to thoroughly correct our mistakes.

### 湖南机械厂领导干部  检讨官僚主义作风

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    湖南机械厂领导干部
    检讨官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：人民日报二月八日刊登了读者来信，对我厂返工废活极多的严重现象提出批评，我们认为这个批评很对，从思想上表示接受。
    我们的官僚主义作风的确很严重，我们在工作中没有当家作主的思想。我们以做一天和尚撞一天钟的不负责的态度，来对待人民企业。我们不深入现场，也不倾听群众意见，只是上令下达，粗枝大叶地把任务交下去就算了。工人加班时，生产课负责干部很少去看。一九五一年九月到十二月铸工的平均废活率是百分之六点三九，对这样严重的问题，我们竟没有加以重视。我们总想铸工的返工废活是不可避免的。我们错误地认为，先进的国家还有废活，我们的厂子还能不出废活？这种不求进步的想法是极错误的。
    为了消灭返工废活的现象，我们进行了下列工作：（一）开返工废活展览会，把损失细账用图表列出来，并把大件废活集中展览；（二）建立每月返工废活统计和会议汇报制度。经过这些教育，我们都警惕起来了。现在，我厂铸工场的返工废活已大见减少，一月份的废品率为百分之五点二，二月份则只有百分之四点二。我们应当更进一步努力，决心彻底改正错误。
    湖南机械厂
