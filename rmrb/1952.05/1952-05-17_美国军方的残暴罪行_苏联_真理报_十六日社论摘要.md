Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 16th entitled "The Brutal Crimes of the American Military." The editorial stated: New reports of the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors in Korea are emerging daily. The American military has embarked on the path of the Hitler bandit gang's brutal rule, the path of bloodthirsty thugs. They have trampled on all standards of human morality and shamelessly and barbarically violated international agreements that provide for humane treatment of prisoners of war and civilians.

The editorial pointed out: The American aggressors are seriously violating the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war and the standards of international law, attempting to detain captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, preventing them from returning home, and planning to hand them over to the Kuomintang clique and the traitorous Li Seung-man gang of the Korean people. In order to realize these despicable and criminal plans, the American aggressors conducted so-called "individual interrogations" among the prisoners of war, using violence and torture to intimidate them, forcing them to betray their motherland, and driving them to fight their own compatriots. The situation of the prisoners of war is deteriorating day by day, becoming unbearable. The U.S. military command has turned the prisoner of war camps into torture camps, and their bestial methods of mistreating people far exceed those of the Hitler fascists.

The editorial continued: On May 7, prisoners of war on Koje Island erupted in angry protests against the barbaric rule of the prisoner of war camp. They detained U.S. prisoner of war camp commander General Dodd and made a number of demands. The new prisoner of war camp commander, General Colson, who was appointed to replace General Dodd, had to admit that the demands of the prisoners of war were just. Colson also admitted that forced screening measures had been taken to force them to join the mercenary army of American interventionists. He guaranteed that "violent actions and bloodshed would no longer occur." After receiving a reply from Colson with clear guarantees, the prisoners of war released General Dodd.

Therefore, U.S. General Colson confirmed the facts of American barbarity towards prisoners of war, which the world had already learned from North Korea and China. He confirmed that the American prisoner of war camps were under a rule of torture and violence indistinguishable from that of the Hitler death camps.

The editorial stated: The confession of the American Koje Island prisoner of war camp commander has caused panic among the American ruling clique. The American military is trying to cover up their crimes. General Colson has been dismissed, and according to reports from American reporters in Tokyo, General Clark, the so-called commander-in-chief of the United Nations forces in Korea, has perfidiously overturned the "terms of the agreement" signed by General Colson and the prisoners of war.

The editorial emphasized: The indescribable atrocities of the American interventionist forces on Koje Island have once again shown the world what path the American imperialists have taken. The American aggressor forces believe that under the cover of the United Nations flag, international legal standards and international agreements do not apply to them. They do not recognize universal humanitarian principles; they only recognize one law, the law of the robber, the law of the Hitler bandit gang.

The American propagandists talk empty words about American democracy, but who can be fooled by this? The atrocities of the American interventionist forces in Korea, their executioner-like treatment of prisoners of war, and their use of bacteriological weapons against peaceful residents are the true face of the democracy of American millionaires and billionaires.

The editorial concluded: The monstrous crimes of the American aggressors in Korea have exposed the hypocrisy of the American politicians, who talk about "humanity" and "democratic principles" but in action establish a fascist tyranny. Such atrocities also expose the hypocrisy of those who joined the United States in the bloody intervention against the people of Korea and China, and who, together with the American ruling clique, defile the flag of the United Nations and use it to cover up inhumane crimes.

No matter how hard the American military tries to deny the barbarous atrocities against the prisoners of war on Koje Island, they cannot shirk responsibility for this crime. The hatred of peace-loving people for the enemies of peace and democracy—the American aggressors—is growing deeper and deeper.

    美国军方的残暴罪行
    ——苏联“真理报”十六日社论摘要
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十六日发表社论，题为“美国军方的残暴罪行”。社论说：每天都有新的消息报道美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行。美国军方已经走上了希特勒匪帮残暴统治的道路，走上了嗜血成性的匪徒的道路。它蹂躏了一切人类道德的标准，无耻地蛮横地破坏了规定给战俘和平民以人道待遇的国际协定。
    社论指出：美国侵略者严重地破坏关于战俘的日内瓦公约以及国际法的标准，企图扣留朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘士兵，不让他们回家，而打算把他们交给国民党集团和朝鲜人民的叛徒李承晚匪帮。为了实现他们这些卑鄙的罪恶计划，美国侵略者在战俘当中进行了所谓“个别讯问”，采用暴力和酷刑来威吓他们，强迫他们背叛他们的祖国，驱使他们去打自己的同胞。战俘的情况一天比一天恶化，叫人无法忍受。美军司令部把战俘营变成了酷刑营，他们虐待人民的兽性手段，远过于希特勒法西斯主义者之上。
    社论接着说：五月七日，巨济岛上的战俘爆发了他们对战俘营的野蛮统治的愤怒抗议。他们拘留了美国战俘营长官杜德将军，并提出了一些要求。被任命接替杜德将军的职务的新任战俘营长官柯尔生将军不得不承认战俘的要求是正义的。柯尔生还承认采取过强迫甄别战俘的措施，这种措施的目的在于强迫他们参加美国干涉者的雇佣军。他保证“使暴力行动和流血事件不再发生”。战俘们在接到柯尔生写的提出明确保证的复信以后，就释放了杜德将军。
    因此，美国将军柯尔生就证实了全世界从北朝鲜和中国方面早已获悉的美国野蛮对待战俘的事实。他证实了美国战俘营处在与希特勒死亡营的统治毫无分别的酷刑和暴力统治之下。
    社论说：美国巨济岛战俘营长官的供状使美国统治集团惊慌万状。美国军方正企图掩盖他们的罪迹。柯尔生将军已被撤职，而据美国驻东京记者报道，所谓朝鲜联合国军总司令克拉克将军已背信弃义地推翻了柯尔生将军和战俘所签订的“协议的条款”。
    社论强调指出：美国干涉军在巨济岛上的难以形容的暴行已使全世界再一次看到美帝国主义者走上了什么道路。美国侵略军以为，在联合国旗帜的掩护下，国际法标准和国际协定对他们就不适用。他们不承认普遍的人道法则；他们只认得一个法律，那就是强盗的法律，希特勒匪帮的法律。
    美国的宣传贩子空谈美国的民主，可是这又能骗得了谁呢？美国干涉军在朝鲜的暴行、他们对待战俘的刽子手手段、他们对和平居民使用细菌武器，这就是美国百万和亿万富豪的民主的真面目。
    社论最后说：美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行揭穿了美国政客的伪善，他们口头上讲的是“人道”与“民主原则”，而行动上却是建立法西斯暴政。这种暴行也暴露了那些与美国一道参加对朝鲜和中国人民的血腥干涉、与美国统治集团一道沾辱联合国旗帜利用它来掩盖违反人道的罪行的人们的伪善。
    不管美国军方怎样竭力抵赖对巨济岛战俘的野蛮暴行，他们是推卸不了这种罪行的责任的。爱好和平的人民对和平民主的敌人——美国侵略者——的仇恨是越来越深了。
