Implementing a “Tight Locomotive Schedule”
    Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau's All Locomotives Exceed 500 Locomotive-Kilometers Per Day
    Nanjing Locomotive Depot's Shen Boguang Crew Sets New National Record for More Haulage and Faster Runs

    After the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau of the Jinan Railway Administration implemented the "Tight Locomotive Schedule" created by dispatcher Wang Zhen, all locomotives increased their daily mileage from an average of 300 kilometers to over 500 kilometers within 24 hours, with some even exceeding 600 kilometers. According to statistics from the Bengbu Sub-bureau, after implementing this new locomotive operation plan, the bureau increases the nation's wealth by 318 million yuan per day, amounting to over 100 billion yuan annually.

    The original train operation plan (basic operation chart) of the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau of the Jinan Railway Administration was not entirely suited to the actual situation, resulting in a lot of waste in the use of trains. For example, the original scheduled time from Bengbu to Changhuawei was seventeen minutes, but in reality, fifteen minutes was sufficient. However, the section from Guandian to Zhanglaoying, due to many curves and slow driving, should have been allocated more time than originally planned. Wang Zhen, aiming at the above shortcomings, worked day and night to consider how to formulate a "Tight Locomotive Schedule" to better fulfill the transportation tasks given by higher authorities. He conducted investigations and gathered information from all aspects through dispatching workers, looking for tricks and ideas. He initially formulated a new "Tight Locomotive Schedule" plan based primarily on locomotive routing, enabling locomotives to travel more than 500 kilometers per day. He also repeatedly studied the Soviet Union's experience in accelerating locomotive operation and, in consultation with the bureau's leadership, further improved the new "Tight Locomotive Schedule" plan.

    After the news of Wang Zhen's creation of the "Tight Locomotive Schedule" spread to the Shanghai and Jinan Railway Administrations, both bureaus dispatched dispatchers to the Bengbu Railway Sub-bureau to learn. Now this advanced experience has been promoted in Shanghai, Jinan, and other places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The Shen Boguang crew of locomotive number 582, a SL7 type locomotive from the Nanjing Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Administration, safely traveled 1,244 locomotive-kilometers and carried 2,233,888 ton-kilometers on April 30th, setting a new national record for more haulage and faster runs. One of the main reasons for the Shen Boguang crew's creation of a new national record is that the workers in the entire crew, after the "Three-Anti" Movement, have raised their class consciousness and displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm as masters of the country, enabling them to come up with all kinds of ways to overcome difficulties and improve technical speed. For example, when the ash pan suddenly malfunctioned, and the ash was full, causing the fire grate to burn red, the assistant drivers Jin Dexin and Sheng Shuzhi, and the thermal engineer Wan Changyou, risked their lives to climb under the train at a speed of over 80 kilometers to find ways to dump the accumulated ash, avoiding an accident. In addition, the close cooperation of other departments was also an important reason for the crew's success. For example, the coal platform workers at the Shanghai Locomotive Depot loaded 7.4 tons of coal in two minutes, shortening the stay time in the depot. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 实行机车“紧密运行图”  蚌埠铁路分局全部机车超过五百日车公里  南京机务段沈波光包乘组创全国多拉快跑新纪录

    实行机车“紧密运行图”
    蚌埠铁路分局全部机车超过五百日车公里
    南京机务段沈波光包乘组创全国多拉快跑新纪录
    济南铁路管理局蚌埠分局实行调度员王震创造的机车“紧密运行图”后，全部机车在二十四小时内由原来平均每台行驶三百公里增加到五百公里以上，有的甚至超过了六百公里，据蚌埠分局统计，该局实行这一新的机车运行计划后，每天就为国家增加了价值三亿一千八百万元的财富，全年就可增加一千亿元以上。
    济南铁路管理局蚌埠分局原来的火车行车计划（基本运行图），不完全适合实际情况，在火车的使用上，有很多浪费。如从蚌埠到长淮卫原来规定十七分钟，而实际上只要十五分钟就够了；但从官店到张老营这一段，因弯路多、行车慢，就应较原来规定增加时间。王震针对以上各项缺点，夜以继日地考虑如何制订一个“紧密运行图”，以更好地完成上级给予的运输任务。他通过调度工人从各方面调查了解情况，找窍门、想点子，初步订出了以机车交路为主、每天能行驶五百公里以上的“紧密运行图”新计划。他又反复研究了苏联加速机车运转的经验，并和该局领导方面研究，进一步改进了“紧密运行图”新计划。
    王震创造“紧密运行图”的消息传到上海和济南铁路管理局后，两局都调派调度员到蚌埠铁路分局学习，现在这一先进经验已在上海、济南等地推广。（新华社）
    上海铁路管理局南京机务段厶ㄌ7型五八二号机车沈波光包乘组，在四月三十日安全走行一千二百四十四日车公里，载重二百二十三万三千八百八十八吨公里，创造了多拉快跑的全国新纪录。沈波光包乘组创造全国新纪录的主要原因之一，是全组工人经过“三反”运动，提高了阶级觉悟，发挥了国家主人翁的高度劳动热情，能够想出一切办法克服困难提高技术速度。例如落灰箱忽然失灵，灰满了，把炉板烧红了，这时副司机金得信、盛书智和热力技术员万长友等，就在八十多公里的速度下，冒着生命危险爬到车底下，想办法把积存的灰倒了出去，避免了事故。此外，其他部门给他们的密切配合，也是该组获得成绩的重要原因。例如上海机务段煤台工人两分钟上煤七点四吨，缩短了段内的停留时间。（新华社）
