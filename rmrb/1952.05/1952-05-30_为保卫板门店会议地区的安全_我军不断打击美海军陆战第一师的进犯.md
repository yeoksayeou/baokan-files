Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 29th: The United States aggressor army's Marine First Division, currently stationed near Panmunjom to the east, has recently been continuously sending small groups of troops to intrude into our Jilingdong area, but each time they have been resolutely struck back by our army.

The US 1st Marine Division was transferred from the eastern front in late March to replace the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 1st Division, because the puppet 1st Division had suffered heavy casualties in frequent attacks against us in this area since the start of the armistice negotiations last year. In late March, precisely when the US side was continuing to play gangster tactics at the administrative meetings of the armistice negotiations, the American aggressors transferred the 1st Marine Division, their so-called main force, to the area east of Panmunjom, obviously harboring ulterior motives. However, the US 1st Marine Division has also repeatedly suffered defeats in the face of the powerful Chinese and Korean People's Army.

Before April 15th, the US 1st Marine Division frequently crossed the Sajiawan River to invade our army. In order to safeguard the security of the Panmunjom conference area, our army launched an attack on Heights 159 and 120, which had been occupied by enemy troops of this division, on April 15th, and achieved victory in just thirty-three minutes. On May 9th, enemy troops of this division, with a force of five companies, and supported by twenty-two tanks, four aircraft, and four artillery groups, fiercely attacked Heights 159 and 120. This offensive was the largest in terms of troop deployment used by the American aggressors in all their offensives in more than three months. The American aggressors vainly attempted to use so-called "military pressure" to cooperate with their blackmail at the armistice negotiation table, insisting on detaining our captured personnel. However, the invading enemy was severely defeated by our army, suffering more than 250 casualties before fleeing in disarray.

This so-called main force of the American aggressor army, the 1st Marine Division, has already suffered many heavy blows in the war of aggression against Korea. In October 1950, after landing in Wonsan, the 1st Marine Division ventured into the Hamhung, Chosin Reservoir (下碣隅里), and Yutanri areas, and was severely attacked by the Chinese and Korean People's Army, suffering more than 10,000 casualties. When the American aggressors launched the so-called "Summer Offensive" at the end of May last year, the 1st Marine Division suffered another heavy blow in its advance towards the Yanggu area, and was forced to be transferred from the front line for reorganization and replenishment. When the American aggressors launched the so-called "Autumn Offensive," the 1st Marine Division was thrown to the front line of Linjie, and was once again beaten bloody. Judging from the history of this division's repeated defeats in the war of aggression against Korea, people can know what kind of fate awaits this division.

### 为保卫板门店会议地区的安全  我军不断打击美海军陆战第一师的进犯

    为保卫板门店会议地区的安全
    我军不断打击美海军陆战第一师的进犯
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十九日电】目前在板门店以东附近地区美国侵略军海军陆战队第一师，最近不断以小股兵力向我智陵洞地区窜犯，但每次都遭到我军坚决的打击。
    美军陆一师是三月下旬从东线调来接替李伪军第一师的，因为伪一师自去年停战谈判开始以来在这个地区向我频繁进攻中遭受了惨重伤亡。三月下旬正是美方继续在停战谈判行政性会议上玩弄流氓手法的时候，美国侵略者将其所谓主力部队的陆一师调到板门店以东地区，显然是怀着不可告人的阴谋的。但是美军陆一师在强大的中朝人民军队面前同样不断地遭到了失败。
    在四月十五日以前，美军陆一师经常越过砂川河向我军进犯。为了保卫板门店会议地区的安全，我军在四月十五日向该师敌军所侵占的一五九和一二零两个高地发起攻击，仅仅在三十三分钟内就取得了胜利。五月九日，该师敌军以五个连的兵力，在二十二辆战军、四架飞机和四个炮群的配合下，猛犯一五九和一二零两个高地。这次进攻是美国侵略军三个多月以来各次进攻中使用兵力最大的一次。美国侵略者妄图以所谓“军事压力”来配合其在停战谈判会议桌上坚持扣留我方被俘人员的讹诈。但进犯的敌人在我军痛击下死伤二百五十多名狼狈溃退。
    这个所谓美国侵略军主力部队的陆一师，在侵朝战争中，已经遭受过许多次惨重的打击。一九五零年十月，陆一师在元山登陆后闯到咸兴、下碣隅里、柳潭里一带，遭到了中朝人民军队的惨重打击，伤亡达一万多人。去年五月底美国侵略者发动所谓“夏季攻势”时，陆一师在向杨口地区的进犯中再受重创，以致被迫调离前线进行整训补充。美国侵略者发动所谓“秋季攻势”时，陆一师被投到麟蹄前线，又被打得头破血流。从该师在侵朝战争中屡遭败北的历史来看，人们可以知道，在等待着该师的是什么样的命运。
