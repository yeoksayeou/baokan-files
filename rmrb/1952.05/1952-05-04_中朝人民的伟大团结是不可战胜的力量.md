    The Great Unity of the Chinese and Korean People is an Invincible Force
    By Nan Wanshou, Representative of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

    During my visit to China, from the Northeast to the distant Southwest, everywhere I saw joyful smiles and intense labor. Everyone is supporting the heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces and the fighting Korean people. I stayed in southern Yunnan for thirty days. My heart was constantly moved. I saw that the movement of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea had penetrated every corner. I saw the love and care of the Chinese people for their comrades-in-arms – the Korean people. Every embrace, every handshake, every enthusiastic cheer showed the close unity of the Chinese and Korean people. Everything made me deeply feel that the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is becoming more and more consolidated and stronger.

    In Gejiu City, we had a get-together with thousands of worker comrades. Although we spoke different languages, this did not hinder our mutual understanding and respect. We held hands tightly, silently congratulating each other on our victories on different fronts. Our feelings were fused together.

    Worker He Qigao told us: After listening to the report of Comrade Ji Bingqian, a representative of the returning Chinese People's Volunteers, in September last year, the number of workers in the tin smelting workshop was reduced from twelve to seven, but the production volume exceeded the original plan by 33%. He took our hands and said: "Our Chinese worker brothers will surely give full play to their creativity, increase production, and practice strict economy in the future to support the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers." They presented a vase made of refined tin that they had produced themselves, with the words "Long Live the Friendship between the Chinese and Korean People" engraved on it. This is a gift shining with internationalism.

    The people of all ethnic groups in the Wenshan Special District, located on the southern border of China, presented precious "Sanqi" (a type of medicinal herb) to General Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai. Although it is far from Korea here, the hearts of every working people are facing the fighting Korea. Hou Yongfu, a combat hero of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, and Guo Chunsheng, a young combat hero, said: "Although our bodies are not in Korea, our hearts are with you. The disasters that American imperialism has inflicted on the Korean people are our disasters. We are determined to unite with our fraternal ethnic groups, defend the borders of our motherland, and support you." What a strong voice of fighting friendship!

    The southern bank of the Red River is the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The northern bank, Hekou City, is a place where Chinese ethnic minorities and Vietnamese overseas Chinese live together. Here, a 90-year-old Li Dama, leaning on a cane, walked onto the stage and presented us with two corns and two papayas, the fruits of her own labor.

    Deng Dama, a 70-year-old Yao woman, traveled barefoot from the mountains 60 miles away to listen to our report. On the way, the middle toe of her left foot was broken by a stone, but she still struggled to come. When we comforted her, she said with a smile, "My foot hurts, but my heart doesn't hurt! You came to see us from far away Korea, can't I endure this little pain?" Tan Wanxian, a representative of the Sandu women, said: "We work like men, and we guarantee that this year's harvest will increase by 50% compared to last year. We will complete the task of public grain as soon as possible, raise more chickens, pigs, and ducks, and donate more to support you, so that we can defeat American imperialism as soon as possible."

    In this atmosphere full of internationalism, I visited these beloved Chinese brothers and sisters, and they said in unison: "Comrades! We brothers and sisters of all ethnic groups live in the era of Mao Zedong. The sun of Mao Zedong illuminates our hearts. We know who our good friends are and who our enemies are. We must do our best to support you." The unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is like pine and cypress, evergreen in winter and summer. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is as strong as steel. The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people will more powerfully strike at the American aggressors. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will be passed down to our descendants forever!

    中朝人民的伟大团结是不可战胜的力量
    朝鲜人民访华代表团代表  朝鲜人民共和国英雄  南万寿
    在访问中国期间，从东北一直到遥远的西南，我所看到的都是欢欣的笑脸，紧张的劳动。所有的人，都在支援英雄的中、朝人民部队和战斗着的朝鲜人民。我在云南南部逗留了三十天。我的心情无时不在激动着。我看到中国人民的抗美援朝运动，深入到了每一个角落。我看到了中国人民对自己的战友——朝鲜人民的热爱与关心。每一个拥抱，每一次握手，每一阵热情的欢呼，都显示了朝中人民的亲密团结。一切一切，都使我深深感到朝中两国人民的战斗友谊，是越来越巩固，越来越坚强了。
    在个旧市，我们曾和万千工人同志们联欢。虽然语言不同，但这却丝毫不妨碍我们之间的互相了解与尊敬。我们紧紧地握着手，默默地互相祝贺着在不同战线上的胜利。我们的感情融合在一起了。
    工人何其高同志告诉我们：去年九月间，听了志愿军归国代表嵇炳前同志的报告后，炼砂间的工人虽然从原来十二人减少到七人，但生产量却超过了原订计划的百分之三十三。他拉着我们的手说：“我们中国的工人兄弟们，今后一定更会发挥高度的创造性，增加生产，厉行节约，来支援朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军。”他们献出了用自己提炼的精锡制成的花瓶，上面刻着“中朝人民友谊万岁”几个字。这是一件闪耀着国际主义光芒的礼品。
    处在南中国国境上的文山专区的各族人民，把珍贵的“三七”（一种药品），赠给金日成将军和彭德怀司令员。虽然这里距离朝鲜很远，可是每一个劳动人民的心，都在朝向着战斗中的朝鲜。人民解放军某部的战斗英雄侯永福和青年战斗英雄郭春声说：“虽然我们身体不在朝鲜，但我们的心是向着你们的。美帝国主义加在朝鲜人民头上的灾难，就是我们的灾难。我们决心团结好兄弟民族，保卫住我们祖国的边疆，并支援你们。”这是多么坚强的战斗友谊之声啊！
    红河南岸，就是越南民主共和国的疆土。北岸的河口市是中国兄弟民族及越南侨民杂居的地方。在这里，一位九十岁的李大妈，扶着拐杖，走上了台子，把她自己亲手劳动的果实——两颗玉茭和两个木瓜献给了我们。
    徭族的七十岁的邓大妈，为了听我们的报告，赤着脚从六十里外的山中赶来。在路上，左脚中趾被石头碰破了，但她仍然挣扎着走来。当我们慰问她时，她笑嘻嘻地对我们说：“我的脚痛，心可不痛啊！你们从老远的朝鲜来看我们，难道我这点痛苦都不能忍受吗？”沙族妇女代表谭婉仙说：“我们和男子一样劳动，保证今年的收成比去年增加百分之五十，早日完成公粮任务，多养鸡、猪、鸭子，多多捐献，支援你们，使我们早日打垮美帝国主义。”
    在这充满了国际主义的气氛中，我访问了这些敬爱的中国兄弟姊妹们，他们异口同声地说：“同志！我们各兄弟民族生活在毛泽东时代，毛泽东的太阳照亮了我们的心，我们知道谁是我们的好朋友，谁是我们的敌人，我们一定要用全力来支援你们。”朝中人民兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊像松柏一样，冬夏常青。朝中人民的友谊像钢铁一般坚强。朝中人民的友谊团结，将更有力地打击美国侵略者。朝中人民的友谊，将永远流传于我们的子孙万代！
