    The leading organs of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government have formulated specific measures to comprehensively carry out the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, convened a national railway telephone conference in Beijing on May 24th to convey the work instructions jointly issued by the Ministry of Railways and the Political Department of the Ministry of Railways on how to carry out the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement in June and July.

    When analyzing the current national cargo and transportation situation, Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out: The first five-day plan in May was completed by 81.8%, the second five-day plan by 94.5%, the third five-day plan by 96.1%, and the fourth five-day plan by 97.8%. Starting from the fifth five-day plan, the cargo and transportation situation has risen more significantly, with daily targets being exceeded. He also pointed out that according to statistics for the first half of May, the national daily car kilometers and over-axle tonnage have greatly increased. The national daily car kilometers reached 430 kilometers, and the over-axle tonnage doubled. After a large number of crew members studied Yang Maolin's loading method, the full load situation has greatly improved. The average net load of goods in the Qiqihar Railway Administration has reached 30.1 tons, and the national five hundred kilometer locomotive unit days have reached 44.5%, nearly 10% higher than in March. Minister Teng continued by stating that the above achievements were due to the tremendous role of the victory of the "Three-Anti" Movement in improving production and the timely publication of the joint decision, especially the importance attached by local Party committees, and the active response of advanced model figures with new production records. These conditions have powerfully promoted the rapid advancement of this movement. Minister Teng then explained that the rapid development of the movement requires leaders at all levels to quickly shift the focus of leadership to organizing and carrying out competitions, seizing the time to do a good job in mobilizing the masses, accumulating experience, and training key personnel.

    Next, Minister Teng Daiyuan pointed out that the focus of carrying out the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement in June and July is: First, it must be centered on deeply mobilizing the masses, and putting the launch of large-scale publicity and mobilization work in the primary position. It is necessary to make all employees understand the political and economic significance of this movement; at the same time, it is necessary to analytically and purposefully oppose bureaucratic and conservative thinking, persuade and educate those who hold skeptical attitudes towards the movement, or who are perfunctory, evasive, and passively resistant, to eliminate ideological obstacles. Minister Teng Daiyuan emphasized the combination of the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement with the implementation of the economic accounting system. He pointed out that the publicity and mobilization work of this movement should be combined with the issuance of this year's production and financial plan and launch discussions among all employees. In the process of formulating personal, group, workshop, and factory/section production and financial plans, a large number of rationalization proposals will inevitably be put forward, and more and greater potential capabilities will be discovered, thus inevitably giving a powerful criticism to bureaucracy and conservative thinking. Minister Teng Daiyuan further emphasized that all railway employees nationwide must strive to learn from the mature experience of the Soviet Union and the China Changchun Railway. Each Railway Administration should have its leaders personally summarize the typical experience of a branch bureau, a section, a station, a workshop group, and an advanced method, to achieve the role of absorbing experience, guiding the movement, cultivating typical examples, and consolidating typical examples. Each Railway Administration should also run training classes for locomotive crew members, traffic dispatchers, and locomotive dispatchers to adapt to the needs of the movement and improve the level of cadres; each locomotive depot should universally establish Zheng Xikun operation method learning classes, using spare time or off-duty time for learning, and pay attention to concentrating all drivers' advanced experience to enrich and develop Zheng Xikun's over-axle five hundred kilometer operation method.

    Finally, Minister Teng called on the administrative heads of each Railway Administration and branch bureau to earnestly study the leadership methods of the China Changchun Railway Administration, carefully analyze the current business development and the development of the movement, propose preparations in labor organization, technology, and equipment, stipulate specific measures item by item, and assign special personnel to be responsible for them. In the implementation process, there must be strict discipline and a close inspection system to ensure the steady development of the movement. After the movement is launched, full attention must be paid to the problems raised by employees regarding working conditions and material life, and they must be properly resolved. For example, the China Changchun Railway Administration explicitly stipulates that hot meals should be delivered to locomotives pulling over-axle and five hundred kilometers, and these crew members will be issued recuperation certificates, etc. This will further encourage the enthusiasm of the drivers pulling over-axle, and enable the full load, over-axle, and five hundred kilometer movement to be better developed.

    中央铁道部滕代远部长
    传达关于六、七两月开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的工作指示
    中央人民政府铁道部领导机关已拟定具体办法，全面开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动。中央人民政府铁道部滕代远部长于五月二十四日在北京召开全国铁路电话会议，传达铁道部、铁道部政治部联合发布的关于六、七两月如何开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的工作指示。
    滕代远部长分析了目前全国货源和运输情况时指出：五月份第一个五日计划，完成百分之八十一点八，第二个五日计划，完成百分之九十四点五，第三个五日计划，完成百分之九十六点一，第四个五日计划，完成了百分之九十七点八，从第五个五日计划开始，货源及运输情况更显著上升，连日均超额完成任务。他又指出：根据五月份上半月统计，全国日车公里与超轴吨数均大大提高。全国日车公里达四百三十公里，超轴吨数增加一倍，在大批乘务人员学习杨茂林装车法后，满载情况大有进展。齐齐哈尔管理局的货物净载重平均已达三十点一吨，全国五百公里机车台日已达百分之四十四点五，较三月份提高近百分之十。滕部长继指出：所以能达到上述成绩，是由于“三反”运动的胜利对提高生产所发生的巨大作用和联合决定的适时公布，尤其是各地党委的重视，先进的模范人物以新的生产纪录纷纷响应，这些条件都有力地推动这一运动迅速前进。滕部长接着说明运动的迅速发展，更要求各级领导将领导重心迅速转变到组织开展竞赛方面来，争取时间作好发动群众，积累经验与培养骨干的工作。
    接着，滕代远部长指出：六、七两月开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动的重点是：首先，必须以深入地发动群众为中心，要把开展大规模地宣传动员工作提到首要地位。必须使全体职工都了解到这一运动的政治意义和经济意义；同时，要有分析地有目标地反对官僚主义和保守主义思想，说服教育那些对运动持怀疑态度和敷衍搪塞消极抵制的人，扫除思想上的障碍。滕代远部长强调满载、超轴、五百公里运动和贯彻经济核算制的结合，他指出：这一运动的宣传动员工作，应当结合下达今年生产财务计划去进行，并发动全体职工展开讨论。在制订个人、小组、车间以及厂、段的生产财务计划过程中，必然会提出大量合理化建议，发现更多更大的潜在能力，因而也就必然给官僚主义和保守思想以有力的批判。滕代远部长更强调了全国铁路员工必须努力学习苏联和中国长春铁路的成熟经验。各管理局应当由首长亲自动手，总结一个分局、一个段、站、一个车间小组、一种先进方法的典型经验，以达吸取经验、指导运动、培养典型、巩固典型的作用。各管理局并应开办机车乘务人员、行车调度人员与机车调度人员的训练班，以适应运动需要，提高干部水平；各机务段并应普遍建立郑锡坤作业方法学习班，利用业余或休班时间进行学习，并注意集中所有司机的先进经验，以丰富和发展郑锡坤的超轴五百公里作业法。
    滕部长最后号召各管理局、分局行政首长必须认真学习中国长春铁路管理局的领导方法，仔细地分析当前业务发展和运动发展的情况，提出劳动组织上、技术上以及设备上的准备工作，逐条逐项地规定出具体措施办法，并且指定专人负责，在执行过程中要有严格的纪律性和严密的检查制度，使运动稳步开展。运动开展后，职工劳动条件及物质生活上所提出的问题，必须充分注意，适当解决。如中国长春铁路管理局明确规定把热饭送到拉超轴、五百公里的机车上去，并将发给这些乘务员以休养证等，这样，就更鼓舞了拉超轴的司机们的积极性，使满载、超轴、五百公里运动获得更好的开展。
