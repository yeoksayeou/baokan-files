(Xinhua News Agency, May 29th) The trade union delegation from the German Democratic Republic, which came to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, sent a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions upon their departure, expressing their impressions of their visit to China. The full text of the original letter is as follows:
Dear Chinese friends:
The delegation of the German Democratic Republic's trade union, which came to the People's Republic of China to participate in the May 1st, 1952 - International Labor Day, would like to thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and all the heroic Chinese people, because they have shown us brotherly friendship everywhere.

Our delegation includes trade union cadres, labor heroes, and representatives of intellectuals. Due to the unbreakable friendship that connects the Chinese and German people, the working people of the German Democratic Republic have long known about many of New China's combat achievements and construction. They celebrated the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong, in their war of liberation, in their struggle against American imperialism, and in their peaceful construction, with great excitement and heartfelt concern.

Now, a workers' delegation finally has the happiness and joy to come among the Chinese people. The deepest impression we received is the inherent and invincible potential of the Chinese people, who have gained freedom and a happy life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great Mao Zedong. We learned with great concern about how the Chinese people had struggled for decades against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries at the cost of serious sacrifices. The achievements gained through such arduous struggle will naturally not be allowed by the workers, peasants, intellectuals, and youth to be taken away by any force in the world! We were deeply moved by the high level of excitement and working enthusiasm of the Chinese people. We admire the unity of the entire Chinese people and their love for Mao Zedong. The strength of the Chinese people after liberation will certainly be able to destroy the evil plans of the American imperialists!

At the moment of leaving the People's Republic of China, the German trade union delegation would like to pay tribute to the Chinese workers again and shake hands with them. In the coal mines and textile factories, we recognized their great achievements and working enthusiasm. We also saw how our brothers—the Chinese workers—have mastered technology, thereby increasing production and striving for the industrialization of the motherland. The Chinese people now have a strong industry, and we believe that these industries will definitely make faster progress in the future, in order to achieve the goal of further improving the lives of the workers. Every time we hear Chinese labor heroes narrating the rapid increase in production, we have infinite joy.

We saw the great construction project of the Huai River. These projects significantly prove how the government of the People's Republic of China cares about the lives of the working people, and also tell us about the Chinese people's will for peace. Because only peace-loving people can build such great peaceful construction projects.

We also recognized the new life in the countryside. Our delegation admires the Chinese peasants, who have suffered from the abuse and exploitation of landlords for many centuries. "Now life can be changed," the farmers in the villages we visited told us. They proudly showed us their harvests, new houses, new farm implements, and their newly purchased clothes and utensils. They told us how agricultural production has increased. Agricultural labor heroes also narrated their new production records. Now they live a life free from the oppression and exploitation of landlords, and they are working for themselves. This guarantees their great achievements.

The German trade union delegation is also deeply impressed by the cultural achievements of the Chinese people over thousands of years, as manifested in great architecture, paintings, woodcuts, and other aspects. In these areas, we see the immortal monuments of the creativity of these great people. Paul Lutzmann, a steel rolling labor hero from the Heitstedt Steel Rolling Mill, said: "The Chinese working people created such brilliant cultural buildings many centuries ago, and now that they have been liberated from oppression, they will surely have even greater achievements." Everywhere we saw and heard working people, workers, peasants, and youth learning with great enthusiasm. We also visited night schools for workers and peasants. A peasant woman proudly told us that she used to be illiterate, but now she can read and write. We visited primary and secondary schools and universities, and saw how these young people are mastering scientific knowledge.

Our delegation would especially like to pay tribute to the youth and Young Pioneers of the People's Republic of China. Wherever we talked with young people, we could see how they are learning and striving for the future of their people. We want to assure them that our German youth are also active construction cadres in building a democratic Germany, and also active peace fighters.

We will return to the German Democratic Republic with a very proud feeling, because we have made friends with such a great and loyal Chinese people. We feel at home here, because you, like us, are fighting for peace, and have a common friend, that is, the Soviet Union, headed by the great Stalin, the banner of world peace! We are very happy to see that you, like us, are learning from the Soviet people.

Before our German people, like you, there are many major tasks. The American war instigators have divided Germany and are trying to drag West Germany into war plans. However, the German people, led by the German workers, are fighting for a unified Germany, to strive for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and to sign a treaty this year as suggested by the Soviet government. In our country's struggle for national freedom, we can learn many things from you. We assure you that in order to strive for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and to smash the war plans of American imperialism, we will spare no effort to fight.

We thank the Chinese working people and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for expressing sincere friendship and profound internationalist spirit to us everywhere. We will convey the new life of New China in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany. Our German workers and all working people will be very happy if they can soon have another opportunity to welcome a delegation sent by our Chinese friends in the German Democratic Republic.

With brotherly greetings.

    德工会代表团返国时畅谈访问我国观感
    【新华社二十九日讯】来我国参加“五一”节观礼的德意志民主共和国工会代表团，在离华返国时，致函中华全国总工会，畅谈访华观感。原信全文如下：亲爱的中国朋友们：
    来到中华人民共和国参加一九五二年五月一日——世界劳动人民节日的德意志民主共和国的工会代表团，谨向中华全国总工会和全体英勇的中国人民致谢，因为他们到处都向我们表示着兄弟般的友谊。
    在我们代表团中间，有工会干部、劳动英雄和知识分子的代表。由于牢不可破的友谊把中国人民和德国人民连系在一起，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民早就知道了许多新中国的战斗成绩及建设。他们以极大的兴奋与衷心的关怀庆祝伟大的中国人民在毛泽东领导之下，在解放自己的战争中，在反对美国帝国主义的斗争中以及在和平建设中的伟大成就。
    现在终于有一个工人代表团能有这样的幸福及快乐来到中国人民中间。我们所得到的最深的印象，是中国人民内在的不可战胜的潜力、他们在中国共产党及伟大的毛泽东的领导下获得了自由及幸福的生活。我们很关怀的知道了许多关于中国人民几十年来如何在严重的牺牲下对帝国主义及国民党反动派从事斗争的事实。这样坚苦斗争所获得的成就，工人们、农民们、知识分子们及青年们自然不会允许世界上任何暴力把它夺去的！我们深深的被中国人民的高度的兴奋与工作热情所感动。我们赞羡全中国人民的团结和他们对毛泽东的热爱。解放后中国人民的力量一定可以摧毁美帝国主义者的罪恶计划！
    德国工会代表团在离开中华人民共和国的时刻，还要再向中国工人致敬，并与他们握手。在煤矿及纺织厂中，我们认识了他们伟大的成绩及工作热情。我们也看到了我们的兄弟们——中国的工人，如何掌握了技术，因而提高了生产以及如何为了祖国的工业化而努力着。中国人民现在已有了壮大的工业，我们相信这些工业以后一定有更快的进展，以达到工人生活更能提高的目的。每次听到中国的劳动英雄们叙述着生产迅速提高的情况时，我们都有无限的喜悦。
    我们看到了淮河的伟大建筑工程。这些工程显著地证明了中华人民共和国的政府如何关切着劳动人民的生活，同时也告诉了我们中国人民的和平意志。因为只有爱好和平的人民，才能兴修这样伟大的和平建设工程。
    我们也认识了农村的新生活。我们代表团赞羡中国的农民，许多世纪以来农民受尽地主的虐待与剥削。“现在生活可改变了”我们参观的那些乡村里的农民们对我们这样说。他们充满了骄傲的心情让我们看他们的收获，新的房子，新的农具和他们新购的衣服和用具。他们告诉我们农产品产量如何提高了。农业劳动英雄们也叙述着他们的生产新纪录。现在他们过着一种不受地主压迫与剥削的生活，他们为了自己而劳动着。这就保证了他们的伟大成就。
    德国工会代表团对中国人民几千年来表现在伟大的建筑、图画、木刻等各方面的文化成绩也深深敬佩。在这些方面我们看出了这些伟大人民的创造力的不朽的纪念物。我们来自海特斯特轧钢厂的轧钢劳动英雄保尔·鲁兹曼说：“中国的劳动人民在许多世纪以前已经创造了这样辉煌的文化建筑，现在从压迫下解放了，一定会有更大的成就。”我们到处都看见和听见劳动人民、工人、农民、青年在非常热情地学习着。我们也曾参观过工人及农民的夜校。一个农妇骄傲地告诉我们说：她以前一字不识，现在已能读能写了。我们参观过中小学及大学，并且看到了这些青年们如何掌握了科学知识。
    我们的代表团特别要向中华人民共和国的青年及少年儿童队致敬。无论在什么地方和青年们谈话时，都可以看出他们如何为了他们人民的前途而学习和奋斗。我们要向他们保证；我们德国的青年也是建设民主德国的积极建设干部，同时也是积极的和平战士。
    我们将以一种极骄傲的心情，返回德意志民主共和国去，因为我们与一个如此伟大及忠实的中国人民做了朋友。我们在你们这里感到如同在自己家里一样，因为你们同我们一样地为和平而斗争着，并且有一个共同的朋友，那就是以世界和平的旗手、伟大的斯大林为首的苏联！我们很高兴看到你们也同我们一样地在向苏联人民学习着。
    在我们德国人民的面前，也同你们一样有着许多重大的任务。美国战争导火者已将德国分裂，而且企图将西德卷入战争计划中。但是，以德国工人为首的德国人民正在为统一德国而斗争着，要争取一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国，并像苏联政府所建议的一样在今年签订和约。在我国为争取祖国自由的斗争中，我们可以向你们学习许多东西。我们向你们保证：为争取一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国、及粉碎美帝国主义的战争计划，我们将不惜用一切力量去斗争。
    我们感谢中国劳动人民和中华全国总工会到处向我们表示衷心的友谊和深厚的国际主义精神。我们要在德意志民主共和国和西德传达新中国的新生活的情形。我们德国工人以及一切劳动人民都会很高兴，如果他们能不久再有一次在德意志民主共和国欢迎我们中国朋友遣派的代表团。
    谨致兄弟敬礼
