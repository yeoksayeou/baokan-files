    Guarantee to Learn from Advanced Experiences and Improve Welding Repair Work

    Editor: Last year, the Ministry of Railways' Oxygen and Electric Welding Repair Training Class was established at Xizhimen Railway Station. Engineers and people with advanced experience from all over the country are further studying and promoting the "Peng Xingde Welding Repair Method" here. Everyone is moved by the fact that the proceeds from their work are used to offset the expenses incurred during the study. During the training class, I absorbed the advanced experiences of many comrades. I believe that after this study, turnout welding repair work can be greatly promoted. I deeply feel that I know very little, and my contribution to the country is too small. Now, the Zhengzhou and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus are doing a good job in promoting advanced experience, which has increased a lot of wealth for the country. I guarantee to learn from their experience in the future and do a better job in welding repair.

    This "Three-Anti" movement has made me more aware of the ugly faces of bourgeois lawbreakers. When I think of them harming our most beloved people, my fighting spirit is strengthened. The production enthusiasm of our entire group of workers is high, and we have shortened the working hours, reducing the number of labor hours per turnout from eighteen to twelve. In order to celebrate "May Day" Labor Day, my group overfulfilled the production task for April and saved raw materials worth more than 100 million yuan. The Party is educating me, and I am making progress in political, cultural, and technical aspects. I must learn from the broad masses of workers and staff, unite with technical personnel, and welcome large-scale economic construction.

    全国铁路劳动模范彭兴德
    保证学习先进经验，把焊补工作做得更好
    编辑同志：去年铁道部氧气及电气焊补训练班在西直门车站成立。全国各地的工程师和有先进经验的人们在这里进一步研究推广“彭兴德焊补工作法”。大家以献工所得来补偿学习时所用的经费，这件事很使我感动。在训练班学习时期，我吸收了很多同志的先进经验。我相信，经过这次研究以后，道岔焊补工作定可大量推广。我深深感到，我知道得很少，我对国家的贡献是太小了。现在，郑州和锦州两个铁路局在推广先进经验方面作得相当好，给国家增加了很多财富。我保证今后学习他们的经验，把焊补工作做得更好。
    这次“三反”运动使我更认清了资产阶级违法分子的丑恶面目。我一想到他们暗害我们最可爱的人，我的斗争性就加强了。我们全组工人生产热情高涨，缩减了工时，每付道岔由十八工降低到十二工。为了庆祝“五一”劳动节，我组超额完成四月份生产任务，并节省原料价值一亿多元。党教育着我，我在政治、文化和技术方面都在进步着。我一定要向广大职工学习，团结技术人员，迎接大规模的经济建设。  铁路劳动模范  彭兴德
