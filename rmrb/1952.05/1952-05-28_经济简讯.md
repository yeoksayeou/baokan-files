Economic Briefs

    ▲ The supply and marketing cooperative business in the vast rural areas of Henan Province has developed considerably. The province now has 1,248 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives with 6.3 million members, accounting for 21% of the province's agricultural population. Over 90% of the 2,099 rural market towns in the province have grassroots cooperatives or cooperative-established retail departments. At present, the rural supply and marketing cooperatives in Henan have become a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy. Last year, the cooperatives purchased more than 50% of the cotton purchased by the Henan Provincial Company of the state-owned cotton and cloth company, and also purchased more than 30% of the wheat purchased by the Henan Provincial Company of the state-owned grain company. The cooperatives plan to purchase 131.1% more cotton for the cotton and cloth company this year than last year.
    ▲ The rural credit cooperative business in Shanxi Province has developed greatly over the past year. The province now has more than 440 credit cooperatives, and more than 540 credit groups or credit departments attached to supply and marketing cooperatives, averaging one credit institution for every 12.5 villages, with more than 100,000 members and nearly 9 billion yuan in concentrated funds. The development of the credit business has played a significant role in leveraging the role of surplus rural funds and driving the development of free lending. In order to more systematically consolidate and develop rural credit cooperatives, the Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China has also formulated a new plan for the future, requiring all of Shanxi to develop an average of one credit cooperative for every four to five villages within three years. In 1952, in addition to consolidating and improving the existing credit cooperatives, it is required to establish 800 new credit cooperatives and concentrate 23 billion yuan in funds.
    ▲ The Liuxia Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, has been conscientious and responsible in this year's tea purchase work, taking care of the difficulties of tea farmers in various ways, and has won praise from the masses. In April of this year, after accepting the task of purchasing tea entrusted by the state-owned tea company, the cooperative transferred cadres from the cooperative and experienced tea farmer members to participate in the work of the purchasing station. Because these cadres studied and practiced day and night, and often asked technical personnel for guidance, they quickly mastered the complex tea evaluation technology. When carrying out the purchasing work, the cooperative cadres publicized the grade standards and prices stipulated by the state-owned tea company to the tea farmers, and put up signs. When inspecting the tea, they repeatedly compared and correctly determined the grade and price, so as not to let the tea farmers suffer losses. In order to save the tea farmers' time, the purchasing station publicized and encouraged tea farmers to sell collectively, and stipulated a priority purchasing method for collective sales by villages or groups. These have been widely praised by the masses.
    ▲ The Dongguan Business Office of the Nanchong County Branch of the People's Bank of China and 16 mutual aid groups including Zheng Guoyou of the Second Village of Laojun Township in the county signed a "Production Fund Mutual Aid Contract" to support the agricultural cooperative mutual aid movement by the state bank. The content of the mutual aid contract is: 1. When the bank issues agricultural production loans, it gives the mutual aid group the priority loan right. 2. When the mutual aid group has an urgent need for production funds, the bank will provide temporary short-term revolving loans. 3. In order to ensure the health of livestock and increase production, the mutual aid group will insure all livestock with the bank. 4. In order to do a good job in production, the mutual aid group should submit a specific production plan for the next month to the bank in the middle of each month. 5. The mutual aid group formulates a storage plan and stores it in the bank on schedule in order to accumulate production funds and expand production. 6. In order to maintain close contact, the bank can participate in the meetings of the mutual aid group at any time, assist in the preparation of production and fund use plans, understand the situation in the group, and solve specific difficulties. 7. The mutual aid group regularly provides suggestions to the bank. This contract greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the mutual aid group farmers to increase production.

    ▲河南省广大农村的供销合作事业已有很大发展。全省现在共有基层供销合作社一千二百四十八个，社员六百三十万人，占全省农业人口的百分之二十一。该省二千零九十九个农村集镇，百分之九十以上都有基层合作社或合作社设立的门市部。目前，河南农村供销合作社已成为国营经济的有力助手。去年合作社为国营花纱布公司河南省公司代购的棉花占该公司购棉任务百分之五十以上，为国营粮食公司河南省公司代购的小麦也占该公司收购任务百分之三十以上。合作社今年计划为花纱布公司代购的棉花，较去年增加了百分之一百三十一点一。
    ▲山西省农村信用合作事业，一年以来有很大发展。全省现在已有信用合作社四百四十多个，另有附属在供销合作社的信用小组或信用部五百四十多个，平均十二个半村就有一个信用机构，社员已发展到十万多人，集中资金近九十亿元。信用事业的发展在发挥农村剩余资金的作用和带动自由借贷的开展上都起了很大作用。为了更有计划地巩固与发展农村信用合作社，中国人民银行山西省分行又拟订了今后新的方案，要求全山西在三年内发展到平均四个至五个村有一个信用合作社。一九五二年内要求除了把现有的信用合作社加以巩固和提高外，新建信用合作社八百个，集中资金二百三十亿元。
