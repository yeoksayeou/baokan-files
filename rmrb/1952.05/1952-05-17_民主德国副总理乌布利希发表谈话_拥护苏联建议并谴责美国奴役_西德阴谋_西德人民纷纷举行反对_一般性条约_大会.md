Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. According to TASS, the German Democratic Republic Information Bureau held a press conference on the 12th. Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, made a statement at the meeting. Ulbricht said that the draft principles of the German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union to the United States, Britain, and France is a document of great historical significance for the future of Germany. Now there is a way to peacefully resolve the German issue. We could have gathered to discuss, based on the Soviet government's proposal for a German peace treaty, to reach an agreement on preparing for all-German elections and establishing an all-German government, which would then participate in the formulation of the German peace treaty. However, since the Soviet Union put forward its proposal, what Washington, London, and Bonn have been planning is not how to reach an agreement, how to hold four-power negotiations, or how to have representatives from West and East Germany meet and negotiate. Instead, they are answering the Soviet proposal by intensifying negotiations on the "General Treaty." They are looking for all possible excuses to refuse to hold four-power negotiations.

Ulbricht then pointed out the enormous scale of the German people's movement against the Bonn government's conspiracy to sign the "General Treaty" and strive for the conclusion of a German peace treaty. He said: Facts have fully proven that the "General Treaty" means enslaving West Germany, and the inevitable result of the "General Treaty" is nationwide resistance to the American and British occupation of West Germany and resistance to the Bonn government. Representatives of all strata of the West German people are opposed to the "General Treaty" that enslaves the German people, including those who have nothing to do with the peace movement. Ulbricht specifically mentioned the bloody suppression by West German police of a demonstration held by West German youth in Essen on the 11th to oppose the "General Treaty," saying: The youth have raised the banner of national resistance against the enslavement of West Germany, and the Bonn government will pay a high price for the blood debt it owes. The German people will bring to justice those who shot the youth for the benefit of American and German militarists. Ulbricht said: Now, not only workers and Social Democrats are opposed to signing the "General Treaty" and striving for a peace treaty, but there is also a significant crisis within the Bonn ruling party. The members of the Bonn parliament clearly understand that those who support the militaristic "General Treaty," who want to enslave West Germany and turn it into an American war base, will not escape the just punishment of the German people.

Ulbricht concluded by saying: Currently, every German can clearly understand the consequences of the "General Treaty." The national movement against the signing and implementation of the "General Treaty" is about to unfold in full force, and the people's movement to strive for a peace treaty and support the Soviet proposal is growing stronger. The Soviet proposal shows that there is now a path to a peaceful resolution of the German issue, and we must move forward along this path.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. According to TASS, people in various cities in West Germany are holding mass rallies and demonstrations, resolutely opposing Adenauer's attempt to conclude a militaristic "General Treaty" with Western countries, and demanding that a peace treaty be concluded with a unified Germany as soon as possible based on the Soviet proposal.

A conference attended by 3,000 residents was held in Munich. The conference passed a resolution stating: The German people want a peace treaty, not a "General Treaty." The resolution called on all residents of Munich to express their demands through mass protests and protest strikes against the "General Treaty": Down with Adenauer, down with his government, down with the "General Treaty"!

A conference of 1,000 residents of Fürth demanded that Adenauer immediately stop negotiations with Western countries on concluding a "General Treaty." The conference representatives of the city's residents demanded that the Adenauer government immediately begin negotiations with the government of the German Democratic Republic on holding all-German elections to restore German unity.

Hamburg youth held a demonstration. Two thousand young men and women marched through the streets of the city, holding torches, protesting the "General Treaty" and demanding Adenauer's resignation. Police disrupted the march and beat demonstrators with batons. But despite police intimidation, protest demonstrations were held in several areas of Hamburg.

Mass rallies against the "General Treaty" were also held in Düsseldorf, Mannheim, Kiel and other cities.

    民主德国副总理乌布利希发表谈话
    拥护苏联建议并谴责美国奴役西德阴谋
    西德人民纷纷举行反对“一般性条约”大会
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国新闻局在十二日举行记者招待会，德意志民主共和国副总理乌布利希在会上发表谈话。乌布利希说：苏联致美、英、法三国照会中所提出的对德和约原则草案，对于德国的前途是具有巨大历史意义的文件。现在有着一条和平解决德国问题的道路。我们本来可以以苏联政府关于对德和约建议为基础，来聚首会商，达成关于准备全德选举和成立全德政府的协议，再由这个全德政府参加对德和约的制订工作。可是，自从苏联提出了自己的建议以来，华盛顿、伦敦和波恩所筹划的不是怎么达成协议，怎样举行四国谈判，怎样使西德与东德双方代表会晤谈判。它们却用加紧进行“一般性条约”的谈判来回答苏联的建议。它们寻找一切可能的藉口，拒绝举行四国谈判。
    乌布利希接着指出德国人民反对波恩政府阴谋签订“一般性条约”、争取缔结对德和约的运动目前已达到如何巨大的规模。他说：事实已经充分证明，“一般性条约”意味着奴役西德，“一般性条约”的必然结果是全国一致反抗美英占领西德，反抗波恩政府。西德各阶层人民的代表都在反对奴役德国人民的“一般性条约”，其中也有那些与和平运动毫无关系的人在内。乌布利希特别谈到西德青年十一日在埃森举行反对“一般性条约”的示威游行时遭到西德警察的血腥镇压的事件说：青年们已经举起全国反抗奴役西德的旗帜，波恩政府必将以很高的代价来偿付它所欠下的血债。德国人民必将使那些为了美国和德国军国主义者的利益而射杀青年的人归案法办。乌布利希说：现在不仅工人和社会民主党人反对签订“一般性条约”，争取缔结和约，而且波恩执政党的内部也已存在着显著的危机。波恩议会的议员们很清楚地了解：那些支持军国主义的“一般性条约”，要奴役西德并把西德变成美国战争基地的人，是无法逃脱德国人民的正义惩罚的。
    乌布利希最后说：目前每个德国人都能够清楚地了解“一般性条约”的后果。全国反对签订和实行
    “一般性条约”的运动即将全力展开，人民争取和约、拥护苏联建议的运动日益加强。苏联建议表明现在有一条和平解决德国问题的道路，我们要沿着这条道路前进。
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德各城市人民纷纷举行群众性的大会和游行，坚决反对阿登纳企图与西方国家缔结军国主义的“一般性条约”，要求尽速根据苏联建议与统一的德国缔结和约。
    慕尼黑城举行了有三千居民参加的大会，大会通过决议说：德国人民希望的是和平条约，而不是
    “一般性条约”。决议号召慕尼黑全体居民通过反对“一般性条约”的群众抗议和抗议罢工来表示自己的要求：打倒阿登纳，打倒他的政府，打倒“一般性条约”！
    佛尔特城一千居民举行大会，要求阿登纳立即停止与西方国家进行关于缔结“一般性条约”的谈判。大会代表该城居民要求阿登纳政府立即开始与德意志民主共和国政府就举行全德选举以恢复德国统一问题举行谈判。
    汉堡青年举行了示威游行。二千名男女青年高举火炬，走过该城的街道，抗议“一般性条约”，要求阿登纳辞职。警察捣乱游行队伍，用警棒殴打示威者。但是不顾警察的恐吓，汉堡若干区域又举行了抗议示威游行。
    在杜塞尔多夫、曼海姆、基尔和其他城市，也举行了反对“一般性条约”的群众性大会。
