The CCP Central Committee's North China Bureau, in order to strengthen the production work of industrial and mining enterprises in North China, has decided to transfer and cultivate a large number of cadres to participate in industrial construction. North China is one of the most important industrial areas in the country, and North China's industry occupies an important position in the entire national economic construction undertaking. In order to restore and develop industry, the party committees at all levels in North China have dispatched many cadres to work in industrial and mining enterprise departments in the past, but the number of cadres in industrial and mining enterprise departments is still very small, far from meeting the actual needs. According to preliminary calculations, factories and mines throughout North China are short of more than 9,700 working cadres. At the same time, the quality of some existing cadres is not high enough, and some cadres have exposed very serious problems in the "Three-Anti" movement. In order to meet the large-scale economic construction that the country is about to undertake, to quickly replenish the number of cadres in industrial and mining enterprises, and to improve their quality, the North China Bureau has decided to transfer a large number of strong cadres to industrial construction, and to promote a large number of worker cadres to cultivate industrial technical talents.

To this end, the North China Bureau has decided to transfer 7,755 people from the current cadres of various systems and departments to work in the industrial and mining system. In addition, 5,000 people will be promoted from the existing workers to assume various leadership positions in factories, mines, and enterprises. The methods of transferring cadres are: first, according to actual needs and the situation of cadres, cadres are transferred from the current cadres of various levels and departments in a certain proportion; second, institutions are streamlined, staffing is tightened, institutions that can be merged are merged, and institutions that can be abolished are abolished to free up cadres for industry.

In order to successfully complete the task of transferring a large number of cadres, the North China Bureau instructed party committees at all levels to pay attention to the following issues: 1. Party committees at all levels must do a good job of ideological mobilization, fully explain the reasons, make everyone realize the importance of turning to industry, overcome various difficulties, and criticize all erroneous ideas. 2. Party committees at all levels should make overall plans, unified adjustments, transfer and supplement as needed, and do everything possible to ensure that other work is not affected or is minimally affected. 3. When transferring cadres, all systems and departments must take care of the overall situation, proceed from the overall interests, obey the unified plan of the party committee, and oppose various forms of departmentalism. When party committees at all levels transfer cadres from various systems and departments, they should pay attention to soliciting the opinions of the relevant departments, appropriately take care of their work, and truly achieve overall planning and consideration. 4. Pay attention to the quality of cadres, strictly select according to the prescribed conditions, and oppose shoddy work.

The North China Bureau also instructed party committees at all levels to make the training of various economic cadres, especially industrial technical cadres, a regular task. First, strengthen the leadership of existing industrial schools and training courses. Various industrial technical schools and training courses should be opened as needed to cultivate a large number of economic and technical talents. Second, all factories and mines should systematically take various measures to improve the political, cultural, and technical level of workers, and cultivate worker cadres, especially technical personnel among workers. Old cadres who have prospects for development in technology should be given learning opportunities, or first place them in technical work positions as assistants, and gradually cultivate and improve them. In addition, attention should be paid to uniting and transforming old technical personnel; it is wrong to ignore them or indulge them without principle; ideological and political education must be strengthened to transform them into technical cadres of the people.

The North China Bureau pointed out that while transferring a large number of cadres, preparations should be made to promote a large number of cadres so as to replenish the shortage of cadres in a timely manner and supply the needs of all aspects. Party committees at all levels should specifically formulate plans for promoting a large number of cadres. Newly promoted cadres should be given regular and patient guidance and helped to overcome various difficulties. At the same time, attention should also be paid to promoting women cadres and young cadres to meet the needs of various economic construction in the future.

    中共中央华北局决定
    抽调大批干部转入工矿企业
    并从工人中提拔大量积极分子担负领导工作
    中共中央华北局为了加强华北工矿企业的生产工作，决定抽调和培养大批干部，参加工业建设。华北为全国重要工业区之一，华北的工业在整个国家经济建设事业中占有重要的地位。为了恢复和发展工业，华北各级党委，过去曾派遣了不少干部到工矿企业部门工作，但工矿企业部门的干部还很缺少，距离实际需要还很远。据初步计算，全华北工厂、矿山缺少工作干部达九千七百多人。同时，现有若干干部的质量还不够高，有些干部在“三反”运动中暴露了很严重的问题。为了迎接国家即将到来的大规模经济建设，迅速充实工矿企业干部的数量，提高他们的质量，华北局决定抽调大批坚强的干部转向工业建设，并大量提拔工人干部，培养工业技术人才。
    为此，华北局已决定从各系统、各部门现职干部中，抽调七千七百五十五人转入工矿系统中去工作。另从现有工人中提拔五千人担负工厂、矿山、企业中的各项领导工作。抽调干部的方法，一是根据实际需要和干部情况，在各级、各部门现职干部中按一定比例进行抽调；二是精简机构，紧缩编制，合并可以合并的机构，撤销可以撤销的机构，腾出干部转入工业。
    为要胜利地完成大批抽调干部的任务，华北局指示各级党委必须注意以下几个问题：一、各级党委要作好思想动员工作，充分讲清道理，使大家认识转向工业的重要性，克服各种困难，批判一切错误思想。二、各级党委要通盘计划，统一调整，随调随补，尽可能作到使其他工作不受影响或少受影响。三、抽调干部时，各系统、各部门都要照顾全局，从整体利益出发，服从党委的统一计划，反对各种本位主义思想。各级党委抽调各系统、各部门的干部时，应注意征求各该部门的意见，适当照顾他们的工作，真正做到统筹兼顾。四、要注意干部质量，严格按规定条件进行选择，反对滥竽充数。
    华北局同时指示各级党委，应该把培养各种经济干部，特别是工业技术干部，作为经常的工作。首先，要加强对现有工业学校及训练班的领导。要按照需要，开办各种工业技术学校和训练班，大量培养各种经济技术人才。其次，各工厂、矿山都应有计划地采取各种措施，提高工人的政治、文化、技术水平，培养工人干部，特别是工人中的技术人员。挑选在技术方面有发展前途的老干部，给以学习机会，或先把他们放在技术工作岗位上作助手，逐渐培养提高。此外，要重视团结改造旧的技术人员；对他们置之不理或无原则地迁就，都是错误的；必须加强对他们的思想政治教育，把他们改造成为人民的技术干部。
    华北局指出：在大量抽调干部时，应同时准备大量提拔干部，以便及时补充干部的缺额，源源供给各方面的需要。各级党委应具体制定大量提拔干部的计划。对新提拔的干部要经常地耐心地予以指导，并帮助他们克服各种困难。同时，还应注意提拔妇女干部及青年干部，以适应今后各种经济建设的需要。
