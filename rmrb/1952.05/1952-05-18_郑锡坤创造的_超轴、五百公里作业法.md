Zheng Xikun Creates the "Super-Axle, 500 Kilometer Operation Method"
    Yue Zhijian

    In July 1950, the Zheng Xikun Youth Chartered Train Group of Locomotive No. 冖ㄎ1105 of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway not only traveled 500 kilometers daily but also hauled 1,549 tons with a super-axle load. This seemingly "ordinary" event at the time actually contained infinite new power. This vigorous new thing, under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and with the help and guidance of Soviet advanced experience and Soviet experts, rapidly spread throughout the railways of the country in 20 months. Although it encountered many setbacks, it still advanced courageously on a tortuous road. In April 1952, this chartered train group created a new record of 1,216 daily kilometers per vehicle and hauling more than 1.64 million ton-kilometers. Following Zheng Xikun's chartered train group, even higher records continued to appear: the Shen Boguang chartered train group of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot had safely traveled 1,244 daily kilometers per vehicle, hauling more than 2.23 million ton-kilometers; several locomotives of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot hauled as much as 7,000 to 8,000 tons with super-axle loads. The main reason why these new records can continue to appear is the adoption of the "super-axle, 500-kilometer operation method" created by Zheng Xikun.

    The Basic Content of Zheng Xikun's "Super-Axle, 500 Kilometer Operation Method"

    What is the basic content of Zheng Xikun's "super-axle, 500-kilometer operation method"? In summary, it consists of the following three parts:

    First, the new manipulation method created by Zheng Xikun.

    People can imagine that a locomotive hauling more than twice the current general standard of goods and traveling 500 to 1,000 kilometers in one day and night will encounter many difficulties. Super-axle loads and fast running inevitably increase the locomotive's burden greatly. The locomotive's tractive force and the burden of the loaded vehicles are always in fierce conflict during the train's operation. Zheng Xikun's new manipulation method is to resolve this contradiction, that is, to maximize the locomotive's tractive force with human initiative to solve the problem of the vehicle's burden. This contradiction is most acute and prominent in the following three aspects: starting, climbing, and stopping. In order to overcome the difficulty of "starting," Zheng Xikun adopted three methods: compressing the coupler [Note 1], sanding [Note 2], and not stopping at the "dead point" [Note 3]. The result of compressing the coupler and sanding is that, on the one hand, the total burden of the train is dispersed by starting separately, and on the other hand, the locomotive's tractive force is increased by utilizing the stored power of the coupler spring and the increased adhesion after sanding. After starting, Zheng Xikun adopted the new manipulation method of "raising the handle high and opening the steam valve wide" [Note 4], ensuring the train's safe and rapid advance, saving both fuel and physical strength. In order to make the train pass smoothly through large slopes, Zheng Xikun adopted the method of accelerating in advance and sanding appropriately when necessary. In order to enter the station and stop smoothly without accidents, Zheng Xikun adopted the method of braking twice to stop after reducing speed in advance. These new operating techniques were all created in practice by Zheng Xikun and his partners with their experience and wisdom, because they were very familiar with the line conditions, mastered the locomotive's performance, understood the state of the train being hauled, and observed complex conditions such as climate and wind direction.

    The old manipulation method is very different from this. It is a very poor asset left to us by the old society. It only mechanically uses the backward methods of "half-opening the steam valve, fixing the handle" and "full of water and sufficient steam," and it cannot haul many tons. In the past, the locomotive's tractive force greatly exceeded the vehicle's burden, and the driving speed was slow, so there was no need to use advanced technologies such as compressing the coupler at all. These facts all show that there is an essential difference between the new and old manipulation methods. One is to subordinate people to machines and turn them into machine parts, the other is to make people the masters of machines and turn machines into tame tools controlled by people; one is passive slave-like labor, the other is creative master-like labor; one separates practical operating experience from technical theory, the other closely combines rich practical experience with technical theory.

    Second, the new locomotive maintenance method.

    A locomotive constantly hauling with super-axle loads and fast running on different lines will inevitably subject the various parts of the locomotive to greater forces and accelerate mechanical wear. How to solve this contradiction? The new locomotive maintenance method created by Zheng Xikun in practice solved this contradiction. The main content of the new maintenance method is to require crew members to become craftsmen, able to inspect locomotives and repair locomotives; learn to correctly use "rust preventives" [Note 5] and thoroughly remove soot to maintain the locomotive's heart—the boiler part; and learn to take care of the various running parts of the locomotive. In this way, it is possible to gradually improve the original poor-quality locomotives, constantly maintain the locomotive in good condition, and enable the locomotive to haul with super-axle loads and run fast. In the past, the locomotive quality maintenance work was entirely the responsibility of the maintenance department. Crew members only knew how to drive, not how to repair; they only managed to use, not to maintain. This outdated and unreasonable division of labor separated the locomotive users and the locomotive maintainers, so the crew members had no interest in maintaining the locomotive. The new locomotive maintenance method made the crew members and the locomotive closely related, so the crew members developed a high sense of responsibility for maintaining the locomotive. The old system in the past enabled crew members to only master one-sided production knowledge, while the new locomotive maintenance method helps crew members become all-round talents proficient in their own technical fields.

    Third, the joint labor work method.

    Having a locomotive that can haul many tons and skilled technical personnel to operate the locomotive can only solve part of the problem of super-axle loads and 500 daily kilometers per vehicle. Because the railway is a huge linkage machine, each department must cooperate with each other; otherwise, the locomotive cannot move forward. The joint labor work method created by Zheng Xikun precisely solved this important problem. The main content of the joint labor work method is that crew members take the initiative to put forward their own plans and requirements, help the work of each department, and resolutely fulfill their obligations. In this way, the uncoordinated phenomenon of each department is overcome, planning is strengthened, labor organization is improved, and the work of crew members and the work of each department are carried out rhythmically like a clock. For example, before each trip, they first find out the situation from the dispatching department and put forward their own plans and guarantees. In this way, the dispatching department can accurately stipulate tasks for them, and they also resolutely implement the orders and requirements of the dispatching department. It can be clearly seen from this that the joint labor work method has great advantages over the old set of systems in the past. The old system only mechanically and formally stipulated the connection between crew members and each department in the labor process, but in fact, each did their own thing, without caring for each other, without helping each other, and being isolated from each other. The joint labor work method broke the shackles of this outdated system, enabling crew members and each department to help and encourage each other in their work, thereby improving the work efficiency of each department.

    The above is the general content of Zheng Xikun's "super-axle, 500-kilometer operation method." The most essential thing that runs through this operation method is the combination of Zheng Xikun's attitude as a national master of labor and his proficient technical literacy. All the facts clearly tell us that if there is no fundamental change in the nature of the enterprise, no serious implementation of the Communist Party's industrial policy in the railway system, and no general improvement in the political consciousness of the working class, it would never be possible for a new type of person like Zheng Xikun to appear. However, merely having the attitude of a master is not enough; it is also necessary for the advanced working class to master advanced technology. Zheng Xikun did indeed do this. The reason why he is called a talent who is proficient in his own technical field is because he has both rich practical operating experience and is able to elevate this experience to the level of technical theory.

    How was Zheng Xikun's super-axle, 500-kilometer operation method formed?

    The emergence and growth of any new thing will inevitably encounter many obstacles; in particular, the corrupt things that are about to be replaced by it will never willingly withdraw from their own activities. Therefore, the formation process of Zheng Xikun's new operation method is also the process of constantly fighting against the bourgeois technical guidance viewpoints and achieving victory. People holding bourgeois viewpoints only see the role of machines but do not see human initiative; they do not understand that since people can create machines, then people can also appropriately change the ability of machines; their views on everything are mechanical and fixed, so they blindly believe in outdated old standards and do not believe in the creativity of the masses. When Zheng Xikun succeeded in super-axle hauling, they said it was "hit by good luck," and even said, "The Japanese have so much technology and calculate so accurately, but they have never done this." When Zheng Xikun succeeded again, they took out some "theories" and "formulas" to oppose it, saying that this method of doing things did not conform to "scientific principles" and destroyed the "old rules." When Zheng Xikun increased the tons of super-axle hauling again, they came out to spoil the fun and said, "This is the end, you can't do more!" However, these backward viewpoints are already lifeless and approaching death, and they have to declare bankruptcy one by one in the face of the struggle of the masses and scientific practice.

    At the same time, Zheng Xikun's new operation method was able to form because it gained the leadership and support of the Communist Party. On every important issue, the Party always supported Zheng Xikun's correct opinions and helped him remove obstacles on the road ahead. It should also be specially pointed out that the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the guidance of Soviet experts were of great help to Zheng Xikun. Many important parts of Zheng Xikun's new operation method were almost all learned from Soviet experts. In addition, Zheng Xikun also humbly learned from middle-aged and elderly technical workers, concentrating many valuable experiences accumulated by them over the years. Therefore, it can be said that Zheng Xikun's new operation method is the result of the combination of the Soviet Union's advanced technical experience and the creative practice of Zheng Xikun and other technical workers.

    Zheng Xikun's new operation method is not only suitable for the locomotive department; its basic principles are also applicable to other production departments. The result of the promotion of this method will inevitably increase labor productivity by one step, accumulate a large amount of funds for the country, create a large amount of wealth, and cultivate a large number of technically proficient talents. The formation and promotion of this method has made a great contribution to the development of the full-load, super-axle, and 500-kilometer movement on the national railways, and therefore will inevitably have a significant effect on the implementation of production reform.

    Zheng Xikun's new operation method is a valuable asset of the People's Railway, and we should cherish it very much and vigorously promote it.

    [Note 1] After compressing the coupler, the vehicles can be started separately, reducing the total resistance of the train; and after the spring in the coupler box is compressed, when the train starts, the spring stretches outward, which can help the locomotive start the vehicles.

    [Note 2] Sanding is to use wind to blow dry sand onto the rail surface to increase the friction between the wheel and the rail surface. In this way, the locomotive's traction can be maximized.

    [Note 3] The locomotive cylinder piston pushes the wheels to rotate, making the locomotive move. If the cylinder piston rod and the wheel crank form a straight line when the train stops, it is stopped at the "dead point" position. At this time, the power of the piston cannot push the wheels to rotate. Therefore, the locomotive's traction is the smallest when it stops at the dead point.

    [Note 4] The handle is a device for adjusting the amount of steam entering the cylinder. Opening the steam valve wide and raising the handle high can increase the pressure of the steam entering the cylinder and utilize more steam expansion force. This is the most economical way to use steam.

    [Note 5] Rust preventive is a combination of several medicines appropriately; it can soften hard water [water containing calcium carbonate (limestone) and calcium sulfate (gypsum)] and prevent water rust from adhering to the inside of the boiler. If water rust adheres to the boiler, it will not be easy to boil the water.

    郑锡坤创造的“超轴、五百公里作业法”
    岳志坚
    在一九五零年七月份，中国长春铁路苏家屯机务段冖ㄎ1一○五号机车郑锡坤青年包车组，每天不仅走行了五百公里，而且超轴牵引了一千五百四十九吨。这样一件在当时看来似乎很“平凡”的事迹，其实蕴藏了无限的新生力量。这个富有生命力的新事物，在共产党的领导、支持和大力推广下，在苏联先进经验和苏联专家帮助、指导下，经过了二十个月的时间，迅速地传遍了全国各铁路。它虽然遇到许多挫折，但在曲折的道路上仍然勇猛前进。一九五二年四月，这个包车组就创造出一千二百一十六日车公里、牵引一百六十四万多吨公里的新纪录。继郑锡坤包车组之后，更高的纪录就不断地出现：南京机务段沈波光包车组已经安全走行了一千二百四十四日车公里，牵引了二百二十三万多吨公里；苏家屯机务段好几台机车超轴牵引了七八千吨之多。这些新纪录所以能不断地出现，主要的是因为采用了郑锡坤所创造的“超轴、五百公里作业法”。
    郑锡坤的“超轴、五百公里作业法”的基本内容
    郑锡坤的“超轴、五百公里作业法”的基本内容是什么呢？总括起来说，有以下三个组成部分：
    第一，郑锡坤所创造的新操纵法。
    人们可以想像到：一台机车牵引着超过现行的一般标准一倍甚至两倍以上的货物，在一昼夜内行驶五百到一千多公里的路程，是会遇到许多困难的。超轴和快跑的结果，必然给机车增加了很大的负担。机车的牵引力和载重车辆的负担始终在列车运行的过程中发生激烈的矛盾。郑锡坤的新操纵法就是为了解决这个矛盾，就是为了以人的能动性在最大限度内增加机车的牵引力，来解决车辆的负担问题。这种矛盾表现得最尖锐最突出的地方，有以下三个方面：一是起车；二是爬坡；三是停车。为了通过“起车”这个难关，郑锡坤采用了压缩车钩〔注一〕、撒沙〔注二〕、不停车于“死点”〔注三〕这三个办法。压缩车钩和撒沙的结果，一方面用分别起动的办法分散了列车总的负担，一方面利用车钩弹簧的储备力量和撒沙后粘着力的增加，来提高机车的牵引力。起车后，郑锡坤采用“高提手把，大开汽门”〔注四〕的新操纵法，保证了列车安全而快速地前进，既节省燃料又节省体力。为了使列车顺利地通过很大的坡道，郑锡坤采用了事先加快速度和必要时适当撒沙的办法。为了平稳地进站停车，不出事故，郑锡坤采用了事先减低速度的两次制动停车的办法。这些新的操纵技术，都是由于郑锡坤和他的伙伴们十分清楚地熟悉了线路情况，掌握了机车的性能，了解了被牵引的列车的状态，观察了气候、风向等复杂情况，以自己的经验和智慧在实践中创造出来的。
    旧的操纵法和这大不相同。它是旧社会所遗留给我们的十分贫乏的财产。它只机械地运用“半开汽门，固定手把”和“水满汽足”的落后方法，它不能牵引很多的吨数。在过去，机车的牵引力大大超过车辆的负担，行驶速度又慢，所以就根本用不着使用压缩车钩等先进技术。这些事实，都说明了新旧两种操纵法是有本质的区别的。一个是把人从属于机器，变成机器的零件，一个是人成为机器的主人，机器变成人所支配的驯服工具；一个是被动的奴役式的劳动，一个是创造性的主人式的劳动；一个是把实际操作经验和技术理论分离开，一个是把丰富的实际经验和技术理论密切结合。
    第二，新的机车保养法。
    一台机车在不同的线路上，不断地超轴牵引和快跑，必然会使机车的各个部分承受更大的力量，加快了机械的磨耗。怎样解决这个矛盾呢？郑锡坤在实践中所创造出来的新的机车保养法就解决了这个矛盾。新保养法的主要内容就是要求乘务员变成工匠，能够检查机车，能够修理机车；学会正确地使用“防锈剂”〔注五〕，彻底清除烟灰，借以保养机车的心脏——锅炉部分；要学会爱护机车的各个走行部分。这样，就能够把原来质量不好的机车逐渐地变好，经常保持机车的良好状态，使机车能够超轴和快跑。在过去，机车质量的保养工作，是完全由检修部门负责的。乘务员只会开车，不会检修；只管使用，不管保养。这种陈旧的不合理的分工，使机车使用者和机车保养者截然分开，因而乘务员对于保养机车是没有兴趣的。新的机车保养法则使乘务员和机车休戚相关，因而，乘务员对于保养机车产生了高度的责任感。过去的旧制度使乘务员只能掌握片面的生产知识，而新的机车保养法则帮助乘务员成为精通本行技术的全面发展的人材。
    第三，联合劳动工作法。
    有了能够牵引很多吨数的机车和良好地操纵机车的技术人材，还只能解决超轴和五百日车公里的一部分问题。因为铁路是一个庞大的联动机，各个部门必须互相配合；否则，火车头就不能够前进一步。郑锡坤所创造的联合劳动工作法，就恰恰解决了这个重要问题。联合劳动工作法的主要内容就是：乘务员主动地提出自己的计划和要求，帮助各个部门的工作，并坚决履行自己的义务。这样就克服了各个部门的不协调现象，加强了计划性，改善了劳动组织，使乘务员的工作和各个部门的工作像钟表一样地有节奏地进行。例如，他们每次出乘之前，都先向调度部门了解情况，提出自己的计划和保证。这样，调度部门就能确切地为他们规定任务，他们也坚决执行调度部门的命令和要求。从这里可以明显地看出：联合劳动工作法比过去那一套陈旧的制度有着极大的好处。旧的制度只是机械地、形式地规定了乘务员和各个部门在劳动过程中的联系，而实际上是各干各的，互不关心、互不帮助、彼此孤立的。联合劳动工作法就打破了这种陈旧制度的束缚，使乘务员和各个部门在工作上能够互相帮助、互相鼓励，从而提高了各个部门的工作效率。
    以上就是郑锡坤的“超轴、五百公里作业法”的大概的内容。贯串在这个作业法中的最本质的东西，就是郑锡坤的国家主人翁的劳动态度和精通的熟练的技术修养的结合。一切事实都很显然地告诉我们：假如没有企业性质的根本改变，没有共产党的工业政策在铁路系统的认真贯彻，没有工人阶级政治觉悟的普遍提高，就绝不可能出现像郑锡坤这样的新型人物。但是，仅仅有了主人翁的劳动态度也还是不够的，还必须要求先进的工人阶级掌握先进的技术。郑锡坤的确做到了这一点。他所以被称为精通了本行技术的人材，就是因为他既有丰富的实际操作经验，又能够把这些经验上升到技术理论的程度。
    郑锡坤的超轴、五百公里作业法是怎样形成的？
    任何一个新事物的产生和壮大，都必然会遇到许多阻碍；特别是将要被它所代替的腐朽的东西，绝不会心甘情愿地退出自己的活动地盘。因此，郑锡坤的新作业法形成的过程也就是和资产阶级的技术指导观点不断地进行斗争而取得胜利的过程。抱着资产阶级观点的人们，只看见机器的作用，却看不见人的能动性；他们不了解，人既然能够创造机器，那末人也就能够适当地改变机器的能力；他们对一切的看法是机械的、固定不变的，因而就迷信已经过时的旧标准，而不相信群众的创造。郑锡坤超轴成功了，他们说是“撞大运”，还说什么“日本人技术多好，算得多准，也没干过这事。”郑锡坤再次成功了，他们又拿出什么“理论”“公式”来反对，说这样干法不合“科学原理”，破坏了“老规矩”。当郑锡坤又提高了超轴牵引的吨数时，他们又出来败兴地说：“这可到了头了，不能再多啦！”但是，这些落后的观点已经是毫无生气、接近死亡的东西，它们在群众的斗争和科学的实践面前，不得不一一宣告破产。
    同时，郑锡坤的新作业法所以能够形成，还因为它取得了共产党的领导和支持。在每一个重要的问题上，党总是支持郑锡坤的正确意见，帮助他扫除前进道路上的障碍。还应当特别提出的，就是苏联的先进经验和苏联专家的指导，对于郑锡坤是有很大帮助的。郑锡坤的新作业法的许多重要部分，差不多都是从苏联专家那里学习得来的。此外，郑锡坤还虚心地向壮年和老年技术工人学习，集中了他们长年积累的许多可贵的经验。因此，可以说郑锡坤的新作业法，是苏联的先进的技术经验和郑锡坤以及其他技术工人的创造性的实践相结合的结果。
    郑锡坤的新作业法不仅适合于机务部门；它的基本原则也适用于其他的生产部门。这个方法推广的结果，必然要把劳动生产率提高一步，为国家积累大量的资金，创造大量的财富；并且会培养出大量的精通技术的人材。这个方法的形成和推广的结果，对全国铁路开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动有极大的贡献，因而对实行生产改革必然会发生重大的作用。
    郑锡坤新作业法是人民铁路宝贵财产，我们应当十分珍爱它，大力推广它。
    〔注一〕压缩车钩后，可分别地起动车辆，减少列车的总抵抗；而且车钩钩匣内的弹簧被压缩后，起车时，弹簧向外伸张，能够帮助机车起动车辆。
    〔注二〕撒沙，就是用风把干燥的沙子吹撒到铁轨面上，以增加车轮和轨面间的磨擦。这样，就能够尽量地发挥机车的牵引力。
    〔注三〕机车汽缸鞲鞴推动车轮转动，使机车行走。如果停车时汽缸鞲鞴杆和车轮曲拐成了一条直线，就是停在“死点”位置了。这时鞲鞴的力量就不能推动车轮转动。因此，机车停在死点时的牵引力是最小的。
    〔注四〕手把是调整进入汽缸蒸汽量的装置。大开汽门、高提手把，可以使进入汽缸的蒸汽的压力增大，可以更多地利用蒸汽膨胀力。这是最经济地使用蒸汽的操纵法。
    〔注五〕防锈剂，就是适当地配合的几种药品；它可以把硬水〔含有碳酸钙（石灰石）、硫酸钙（石膏）的水〕软化，防止锅炉内部附着水锈。锅炉附着了水锈，就不容易把水烧沸了。
