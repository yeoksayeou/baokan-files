Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th—According to TASS, New York: On the evening of May 13th, sixteen thousand citizens of New York held a rally in Madison Square Garden to celebrate the sixteenth anniversary of the American Labor Party (the Progressive Party's organization in New York State). The rally was held under the slogans of peace, democracy, and social security put forward by the American Progressive Party as its platform for participating in the presidential election. Speakers at the meeting included: Mrs. Bass, the Progressive Party's vice-presidential candidate; Mrs. Halinan, wife of the Progressive Party's presidential candidate; Mr. Macantonio, chairman of the leadership committee of the American Labor Party and former member of Congress; and Dr. Du Bois, a famous progressive black leader.

Mrs. Bass said: The Truman government has not fulfilled its promises to strive for peace, protect civil rights, abolish the anti-labor Taft-Hartley Act, and guarantee people's living standards. The heads of the two old parties, the Democratic and Republican parties, are no longer able to play their old tunes in front of the people in 1952. Therefore, they are looking for new masks to cover up their true colors. The policies of these two bourgeois parties are geared towards war. They use our country's wealth for war and war preparations, and are unwilling to use it for the welfare of the people. They do not allow freedom and equality in the United States. They are intensifying repression.

Mrs. Halinan continued, condemning the United States for using napalm bombs and bacteriological weapons to slaughter women and children in Korea.

Macantonio said: "For a few, arms production means profit, while for the vast masses of people in the world, it means poverty, disaster, and death. The most solid defense of the United States is to hold a round-table conference with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Britain, and France to solve the problems of peace and universal disarmament." He called on Progressive Party members to "begin a counter-offensive for peace, freedom, and equality."

Professor Du Bois emphasized in his speech that the two old parties are both at the beck and call of American monopoly capital, and they form a super-congress, whose Senate is the "National Association of Manufacturers" and whose House of Representatives is the "American Chamber of Commerce." They are preparing for a world war in order to dominate all mankind and reduce workers not only to the status of slaves, but also to make them ignorant. Du Bois finally pointed out: "As long as we want peace, we will surely win peace."

Baldwin, Secretary of the Progressive Party National Committee, announced that the Progressive Party has obtained the right to nominate candidates in many states. He said that this is just the beginning, and the Progressive Party is determined to strive to put forward its own list of candidates in all forty-eight states, especially in Illinois, where the Progressive Party had previously been illegally deprived of this right.

    纽约人民万余人庆祝纽约州进步党成立十六周年
    巴斯夫人等谴责杜鲁门政府的战争政策
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：纽约一万六千市民五月十三日晚在麦迪逊广场举行大会，庆祝美国劳工党（进步党在纽约州的组织）成立十六周年。大会在美国进步党作为参加总统竞选政纲提出的争取和平、民主与社会保险的口号下进行。在会上发表演说的有：进步党副总统候选人巴斯夫人，进步党总统候选人哈利南的夫人，美国劳工党领导委员会主席、前国会议员马肯托尼奥，著名进步黑人领袖杜波依斯博士等人。
    巴斯夫人说：杜鲁门政府没有执行它的诺言，即争取和平、保护公民权利、废除反劳工的塔夫脱—哈特莱法及保障人民生活水准的诺言。民主党和共和党两个老政党的头子们在一九五二年已经无法再在人民面前弹他们的老调了，因此，他们正在寻找新的面具来掩饰他们的本相。这两个资产阶级政党的政策是适应战争的。他们把我国的财富用在战争和战争准备方面，而不愿意用来为人民谋福利。他们不让美国有自由与平等。他们正加紧镇压。
    哈利南夫人接着发言，她谴责美国使用凝固汽油弹和细菌武器来屠杀朝鲜的妇女和孩子。
    马肯托尼奥发言说：“军火生产对少数人来说，是意味着利润，而对世界广大人民群众来说，就意味着穷困、灾难和死亡。美国最牢固的防御是：和苏联、中华人民共和国、英国与法国举行圆桌会议解决和平问题与普遍裁军。”他号召进步党党员“开始为和平、自由与平等而实行反攻”。
    杜波依斯教授在发言时着重指出，两个老党都是唯美国垄断资本之命是听的，它们组成一个超级国会，它的参议院就是“全国制造商协会”，众议院就是“美国商会”。它们正在准备世界大战，以求统治全人类并把工人不仅降到奴隶地位、而且还要使他们变成愚昧无知。杜波依斯最后指出：“只要我们要和平，我们就必能赢得和平。”
    进步党全国委员会书记鲍尔温宣布：进步党已经在许多州获得了提出候选人的权利。他说，这只不过是开始，进步党决心要争取在全国四十八州都提出自己的候选人名单，尤其是在进步党以前曾被非法剥夺这种权利的伊利诺斯州。
