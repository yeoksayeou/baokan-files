    Our Greatest Happiness
    Jin Hanzhou, Dean of Kim Il-sung University, Korea
    I have the honor of celebrating the May Day of 1952, a review and demonstration of the fighting strength of the world's proletariat, in Beijing, the capital of the new China.
    Today, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the entire Chinese people are commemorating May Day while holding high the victorious banner of resisting America and aiding Korea. When I saw the solemn words "Salute the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers" and "Salute the heroic Korean people" in the call from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to celebrate May Day, I couldn't help but feel a surge of warm gratitude towards the Chinese people. To the brothers and sisters in the homeland and all comrades-in-arms who are living through the brutal struggle against American imperialist aggression! I extend to you the most lofty respect from the new China!
    Since 1889, International Labor Day has been commemorated around the world with the blood of advanced workers under the oppression of reactionary ruling classes; only after the great October Revolution in the Soviet Union led by the Party of Lenin and Stalin did a new era begin, and May Day in Moscow became a banner inspiring the oppressed classes and oppressed nations of all countries in the world to fight resolutely and achieve victory. The victory of the great Chinese People's Revolution has opened a new page in the history of Asia. Therefore, today's May Day in Beijing and May Day in Moscow are both great banners of the ever-increasing socialist and democratic peace forces in the world, foreshadowing the victory of the people's revolution worldwide.
    Today, due to the conditions of war and the enemy's barbaric bombing, the Korean people will not be able to hold large-scale celebrations for this year's May Day; but whether in the trenches, in factories in the rear, in rural areas, or in schools, the Korean people, in every place of struggle, will celebrate the deeply meaningful May Day together with the Chinese People's Volunteers. The song of General Kim Il-sung, the organizer of the Korean people's victory, and the song of Chairman Mao Zedong, our nation's benefactor, will resonate throughout our beautiful land.
    I am excited to join my comrades in commemorating May Day. Participating in the Beijing May Day demonstration parade reviewed by the great Chairman Mao is our greatest happiness.
    Today, on Earth, from the Elbe River to the Pacific Ocean, the red flag of freedom and peace of the victorious people is heroically flying in the wind, and the internationalist solidarity of freedom-loving people around the world under the leadership of the great Stalin is growing stronger day by day.
    Victory belongs to us.
    We feel supremely honored to participate in the May Day demonstration of the fighting forces of the working people in Beijing, and we will repay our Chinese comrades with loyalty to our motherland, strengthening the strong unity between the Chinese and Korean people, and further defeating the aggression of American imperialism.

    我们最大的幸福
    朝鲜金日成综合大学教务长  金汉周
    我光荣地在新中国的首都——北京赶上了全世界无产阶级战斗力量检阅和示威的一九五二年劳动节。
    今天，全中国人民在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和中国共产党的领导下，高举着抗美援朝的胜利的旗帜纪念“五一”节。当我看见中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会为庆祝五一劳动节的号召中“向英勇的中国人民志愿军致敬”、“向英勇的朝鲜人民致敬”的庄严的词句时，我的心里不禁涌现出对中国人民热烈感激的情绪。在反对美帝国主义侵略的残酷斗争中生活着的祖国兄弟姊妹们和所有的战友们！我在新中国向您们致以最崇高的敬意！
    从一八八九年以来，五一国际劳动节都是在反动统治阶级的压迫下，在世界各处，以先进的劳动者的血来纪念的；只在列宁斯大林的党所领导下的伟大的苏联十月革命以后才开辟了新纪元，莫斯科的五一劳动节成了鼓舞全世界各国的被压迫阶级和被压迫民族坚决斗争和胜利的旗帜。伟大的中国人民革命的胜利给亚洲的历史展开了新的一页，因此，今天北京的五一劳动节和莫斯科的五一劳动节同是在全世界日益增强着的社会主义和民主和平力量的两面大旗，预示着全世界人民革命的胜利。
    今天朝鲜人民由于战争的条件和敌人野蛮的轰炸，今年的五一劳动节将不能举行大规模的盛大庆祝；可是无论在战壕、在后方的工厂、农村或学校，朝鲜人民在斗争的每一个地方，都将和中国人民志愿军同志们在一起庆祝意义深远的五一节。朝鲜人民胜利的组织者金日成将军之歌和我们民族的援助者毛泽东主席之歌将响彻我们的大好河山。
    我激动地和同志们一起参加五一劳动节的纪念。参加由伟大的毛主席所检阅的北京五一劳动节示威游行队伍是我们最大的幸福。
    今天，在地球上，从易比河到太平洋，胜利的人民的自由与和平的红旗正在英雄地迎风飘荡着，在伟大斯大林领导下的全世界爱好自由的人民的国际主义的团结正在日益加强。
    胜利是属于我们的。
    在北京参加劳动人民战斗力量示威的五一劳动节，我们感到无上的光荣，我们将以对于我们祖国的忠诚、增强中朝两国人民的坚强团结，并进而击败美帝国主义的侵略来报答中国的同志们。
