    How the Quick Literacy Method Was Created
    -- An Interview with Qi Jianhua, Creator of the Quick Literacy Method
    Bai Sheng
    To understand the creation process of the quick literacy method, the reporter interviewed Qi Jianhua.
    Qi Jianhua is a model cultural instructor and Communist Party member in the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He was born into a poor peasant family in Jia County, Henan Province. His father starved to death in a dilapidated temple when he was young, his grandmother died begging outside, and his older sister and younger brother also died of illness, leaving only him and his mother living with his uncle, helping him with farming and gathering firewood. At the age of fourteen, he entered a free night school. In the first lesson, the teacher taught him the phonetic symbols "一ㄨㄩ". The next evening, he taught him the sound of a duck quacking, "ㄍㄚ". He was very interested and learned all the "勹攵冖匚" in one go. After seven or eight nights of study, he not only learned all the phonetic symbols but also understood some of the spelling methods. That year, he obtained his uncle's permission to formally attend the primary school in his village and was placed in the third grade of primary school. After that, he repeatedly dropped out and returned to school, finally completing junior high school. During his self-study period, he found an eight-thousand-character dictionary and, relying on the phonetic symbols, learned to read the dictionary in eleven days. This experience was very enlightening for his later creation of the quick literacy method.
    In 1948, after the liberation of Jia County, Henan, he was admitted to the Central Plains Military and Political University. After graduation, he became a staff member in the health department of a certain unit. One day, the work team leader said to him, "You may be engaged in cultural and educational work in the future, teaching soldiers to read." He then considered how to use a quick method to teach soldiers to read and thought of phonetic symbols. Soon, a soldier named Wang Xiangde was transferred to the work team; he was not very literate. Qi Jianhua began to try using phonetic symbols to teach him to read the popular reading material "New Three Character Classic" published by the People's Army, which yielded great results. Wang Xiangde learned nearly fifty characters a day and finished the book in a few days. This was more than ten times faster than teaching soldiers three or five characters a day in the past. This pilot teaching increased his confidence. Then he was transferred to the health department's training team as a cultural instructor. With the support of the Party and superiors, he began to boldly use phonetic symbols for teaching among the vast number of soldiers. At this time, the troops were beginning to march towards the Great Southwest. On the march, under extremely difficult learning conditions, he stubbornly persisted in using phonetic symbols to teach soldiers to read. In 1950, after the troops arrived in Zunyi, Guizhou, a cultural learning movement was launched among the soldiers. Qi Jianhua again used phonetic symbols to teach soldiers to read. He first selected 1,200 commonly used characters, attached phonetic symbols, and wrote them into two large character lists, focusing his efforts on teaching soldiers to learn, teaching forty characters a day. During this period, he carefully studied the soldiers' psychological characteristics and living conditions, knowing that they had rich combat experience, strong comprehension, and a very urgent desire to learn culture. However, they lacked confidence in learning, believing that they were too old, had poor memory, and that recognizing characters was difficult. He realized that to solve the soldiers' contradictory psychology of wanting to learn but fearing difficulty, it was first necessary to abandon the old literacy teaching method and break the established practice of learning only three or five characters a day. At the same time, according to the soldiers' psychological characteristics of loving simplicity, liking
    "one-on-one" instruction, and being good at surprise attacks, he first required the soldiers to be able to recognize and read, then required them to be able to speak and write, and then required them to practice reading newspapers and writing sentences. This teaching method was completely different from the old teaching method of "reading, speaking, writing, and using" simultaneously. But initially, some soldiers still hadn't fully understood, for example, soldier Lu Guoding said, "Teaching forty characters a day, that's not like eating or drinking characters." Soldier Sun Zhiyuan said, "No matter how much you teach, I'll learn as much as I can." Some soldiers said, "Even if you break my head open, I can't fit so many characters in a day!" Qi Jianhua understood the soldiers' ideological sentiments and knew that it was necessary to fully carry out mobilization work; learning must be combat-oriented, and thoughts must be concentrated to achieve results. He paid special attention to this when teaching. He said to the soldiers, "I guarantee you can learn forty characters a day, but you must have confidence. We had the confidence to win the Huaihai Campaign, so why don't we have confidence in learning culture? We can catch the enemy who runs, can't we catch the characters that don't run?" He also asked the soldiers, "Do we need weapons to fight?" Everyone said, "Yes!" "Do we need tools for production?" Everyone said, "Yes!" He then asked, "Do we need methods for learning?" Everyone said, "Yes!" He then said loudly to the soldiers, "Okay, now we have a good method for literacy, and we can learn dozens or hundreds of characters a day. As long as everyone's thoughts are cleared, their energy is concentrated, and their worries are removed, I can guarantee that everyone will be able to read popular books and newspapers and write simple drafts in three or four weeks." After such repeated mobilization, the soldiers' learning enthusiasm improved. After that, he devoted all his energy to teaching, grasping the soldiers' learning emotions. At the same time, he also followed the principle of easy to difficult, starting with "一ㄨㄩ". As a result, he not only achieved great results but also further improved his teaching method. Lu Guoding, a soldier who originally had little confidence in learning, said after learning for three days: "The first day I learned forty characters, the second day I gritted my teeth and learned sixty characters, and the third day I learned eighty characters, hey! I learned them all." After seven days, Lu Guoding, who originally only knew more than two hundred and fifty characters, recognized one thousand three hundred characters.
    In the classroom, Qi Jianhua used lively language that the soldiers were familiar with to explain the text and the meaning of the characters vividly. He said to the soldiers, "Learning phonetic symbols and recognizing characters must be combat-oriented. Comrades, you all like to fight surprise attacks, and today we must also use the spirit of fighting surprise attacks to learn culture; fighting requires listening to the commander's orders, and learning culture also requires listening to the cultural instructor's orders. Everyone is a commando, and I am the commando captain." Then, he led everyone to sing a song with a new lyrics filled in an old tune
    "Learn from the model learners." Everyone's emotions became high. After singing it several times, he said: Okay, now I'll start teaching phonetic symbols. Pointing to "一", he asked everyone: What does this character read? Someone shouted: Read "一". He then led everyone to read "一" loudly. He also used the most familiar things and vocabulary of the soldiers to explain, such as the sound of "一" is the "一" in one, two, three, four, the "衣" in clothes, the "意" in giving opinions, and the "义" in communism. Then he taught "ㄨ" and "ㄩ" in the same way. And asked them to look at the illustrations on the vocabulary list, lead them to read. When everyone learned the letters, he started teaching Pinyin. Then began the rush of new words.
    In August 1950, Qi Jianhua was elected as a representative to attend the First Cultural and Educational Work Conference of the Guizhou Military Region. This conference specifically discussed the quick literacy method. After the meeting, Qi Jianhua conducted demonstration teaching. After careful study by everyone, the higher authorities sent a working group to help him summarize his experience, which further improved the method. After that, the quick literacy method began to be promoted and experimented with in the units under the Guizhou Military Region. The results of repeated experiments in the army for more than a year have proved that the quick literacy method is a good method for eliminating illiteracy.
    The reason why the quick literacy method was successful, as Comrade Qi Jianhua himself said: "First of all, it should be attributed to the leadership of the Party and superiors. Without the instructions of the Party, without the attention and support of the leading comrades, without the joint practice of the masses, and without the help of the comrades in the propaganda and education work of the troops, it would be difficult to imagine the emergence of such a quick literacy method." He also said: "The success of the quick literacy method is not simply due to the method itself, but mainly based on the high political awareness, the spirit of consciously learning, and the perseverance of hard study and research in our troops." In the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, not only the soldiers of the troops have the above conditions, but the workers, peasants, and the general public also have these conditions. This is the basis for the quick literacy method to be universally promoted and to be universally promoted.

    速成识字法是怎样创造出来的
    ——访速成识字法创造者祁建华
    柏生
    为要了解速成识字法的创造经过，记者访问了祁建华。
    祁建华是中国人民解放军西南军区的一个模范文化教员，共产党员。他出生在河南郏县一个贫农家庭里，幼时父亲饿死在破庙里，祖母要饭死在外面，姐姐和弟弟也都病死了，只剩下他和母亲寄居在舅舅家里，帮助舅父种地、打柴。十四岁进了免费的夜校，第一堂课，老师教他注音符号“一ㄨㄩ”，第二天晚上，又教了一个鸭子嘎嘎叫的声音“ㄍㄚ”。他非常感兴趣，一口气把“勹攵冖匚”也全学会了。经过七八个夜晚的学习，他不仅学会了所有的注音符号，而且懂得了一些拼音的方法。那年，他得到舅舅的允许，正式上了本村的初级小学，被编在初小三年级里。此后他一再失学又上学，好容易读完了初中课程。在自学期间，他找到了一本八千字的字典，依靠着注音符号，在十一天内就念会了这本字典。这一经验，对于他后来创造速成识字法是很有启发作用的。
    一九四八年，河南郏县解放以后，他考入中原军政大学。毕业后到某部卫生部当工作员。一天，工作组长对他说：“以后你可能去搞文化教育工作，教战士识字。”他便考虑怎样用速成的方法教战士们识字，想起了注音符号。不久，一个叫王祥德的战士调到工作组里来了，他识字不多。祁建华就开始试用注音符号教他读人民军队出版的通俗读物“新三字经”，获得了很大的效果。王祥德一天学会近五十个字，几天就把这本书学完了。这比过去一天教战士们学三、五个字要快十倍以上。这个试验教学提高了他的信心。接着他被调到卫生部训练队当文化教员。在党和上级的支持下他便开始大胆地在广大的战士中用注音符号进行教学。这时部队正开始向大西南进军。在进军途中极困难的学习条件下，他仍顽强地坚持着用注音符号教战士识字。一九五○年，部队到达贵州遵义以后，在战士中展开了文化学习运动。祁建华又用注音符号教战士识字。他先检出一千二百个常用字，附上注音符号，分写成两大张生字表，集中力量教战士学习，每天教四十个字。在这一时期，他更细心地研究了战士们的心理特点和生活情况，知道他们斗争经验丰富，理解力强，学文化的要求非常迫切。但他们对学习缺乏信心，认为岁数大了，记忆力差，认字是件难事。他认识到要想解决战士这种想学又怕难的矛盾心理，首先必须抛弃过去旧的识字教学法，打破每天只学三、五个字的成规。同时根据战士爱简单、喜欢
    “单打一”、好打突击仗的心理特点，先要求战士会认、会读，然后要求他们会讲、会写，进而要求他们练习读报、写话。这种教学法是和过去“读、讲、写、用”同时并进的旧的教学法完全不同的。但最初有些战士还是没有完全打通思想，例如战士吕国丁说：“一天教四十个字，那又不是吃字喝字。”战士孙志远说：“不管你教多少，我该学多少就学多少。”有的战士说：“敲破我的脑袋，一天也装不下这么多的字啊！”祁建华了解了战士们的思想情绪，知道必须充分地进行动员工作；学习必须战斗化，思想要集中，才能取得成绩。教课时他便特别注意了这一点。他对战士们说：“我保证你们一天能学四十个字，不过，你们要有信心。淮海战役我们有信心打胜仗，学文化就没有信心吗？会跑的敌人我们能抓住他，不会跑的字，我们就不能抓住它吗？”他又问战士们：“打仗要不要武器？”大家说：“要！”“生产要不要工具？”大家说：“要！”他又问：“学习要不要方法？”大家说：“要！”他便大声地向战士们说：“好了，现在我们已经有了一个识字的好方法，一天可以学会几十、几百个字。只要大家思想打通，精力集中，去掉顾虑，我就能保证大家在三、四个星期后会看通俗的书报，能写简单的稿子。”在这样反复动员之后，战士们的学习情绪提高了。此后他便以全副精力贯注在教学中，掌握了战士的学习情绪。同时，他又根据从易到难的原则，先从“一ㄨㄩ”教起。结果，他不但取得了很大的成绩，而且进一步改进了自己的教学法。原来学习信心不高的战士吕国丁，学了三天以后说：“第一天我学了四十个字，第二天咬咬牙，我学了六十个字，第三天又学了八十个字，嗨！也都学会了。”七天以后，原来只认得二百五十多个字的吕国丁，便认了一千三百字。
    在课堂上，祁建华用生动活泼的、战士们熟悉的语言，有声有色地讲解课文和字义。他对战士们说：“学习注音符号和认字要战斗化。同志们，你们都喜欢打突击仗，今天我们也要用打突击仗的精神来学文化；打仗要听指挥员的指挥，学文化也要听文化教员的指挥。大家都是突击队员，我是突击队长。”接着，他领大家唱了一个旧调填新词的歌
    “向学习模范们看齐”。大家的情绪便高涨起来。唱了几遍之后，他说：好了，这会我开始来教注音符号。他指着“一”问大家：这个字念啥？有人喊：念“一”。他便领着大家大声念“一”。他又用战士们最熟悉的事物、词汇进行讲解，如“一”的声音是一二三四的“一”，是衣服的“衣”，是提意见的“意”，是共产主义的“义”。接着他又用同样的方法教“ㄨ”和“ㄩ”。并要他们看生字表上的图解，带他们念。等到大家学会了字母，他就开始教拼音。随后便开始突击生字。
    一九五○年八月，祁建华被推选为出席贵州军区第一届文教工作会议的代表。在这个会议上专门讨论了关于速成识字法的问题。会后，祁建华进行了示范教学。经过大家的仔细研究，上级并派工作组帮助他总结了经验，使这个方法得到了进一步的提高。此后，速成识字法便开始在贵州军区所属的部队中推广实验起来。一年多来在部队里反复实验的结果，证明速成识字法是扫除文盲的良好方法。
    速成识字法之所以获得成功，正像祁建华同志自己所说：“首先应归功于党和上级的领导。要是没有党的指示，没有领导同志的重视、支持，没有群众的共同实践，没有部队宣教工作同志的帮助，就很难设想会出现这样一个速成识字法。”他又说：“速成识字法之所以获得成功，不是单纯由于方法本身，最主要的是基于我们部队具有高度的政治觉悟，自觉学习的精神，和苦学钻研的毅力。”在毛主席和共产党领导下的新中国，不但部队战士们具有上述的条件，工人、农民和一般群众都具有这些条件。这就是速成识字法应该普遍推行，而且能够普遍推行的根据。
