    The Panshan County Post and Telecommunications Bureau of Liaoxi Province
    Should Pay Attention to Newspaper Distribution

    Comrade Editor: In order to meet the needs of the general readers, the Panshan County Cultural Center of our Liaoxi Province has subscribed to several newspapers from all regions of the country from the Panshan County Post and Telecommunications Bureau. However, Comrade Jia Xiangjiu, who is responsible for this matter at the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, is irresponsible in his work. We subscribed to the Xinjiang Daily in January of this year, and we still haven't received it. Every time we urge him, his reply is always: "I've inquired about it for you." I think his attitude is wrong and he should make a self-criticism.

    辽西省盘山县邮电局
    应重视报纸发行工作
    编辑同志：我们辽西省盘山县人民文化馆为了满足广大读者的需要，向盘山县邮电局订了全国各地区的几种报纸。但邮电局负责这件事情的贾香久同志对工作不负责任。今年一月份我们订的新疆日报，到现在仍未收到。我们每次催问他，他每次的答复都是：给你们打听去了。我认为他这种态度是错误的，应该作检讨。    留声
