    (10) Wang Quanbao's son also wanted to plant more cotton, so he discussed it with his father. However, Wang Quanbao, because he didn't study politics, still had an old mindset. He said, "Plant what we eat, let's just plant the usual two mu. If we plant too much, we won't be able to sell it for a good price, and we'll still suffer a loss."
    (11) Li Sixiao's mutual aid team invited Wang Lao Han, a technical expert, to guide weeding in order to improve the team members' weeding skills. Wang Lao Han told everyone, "We are not only afraid of late planting, but even more afraid of late weeding..."
    (12) At this time, cotton aphids were suddenly discovered on the cotton seedlings. Li Sixiao's mutual aid team quickly took out surplus grain and borrowed 7 million yuan from the bank to buy a lot of pesticides and nine sprayers. Look, they are eliminating pests in the cotton fields.

    （十）王全保的儿子也想多种些棉花，就和他爹商量。可是王全保因为不学习政治，还是旧脑筋。他说：“吃甚种甚，咱照旧种上二亩吧。种多了卖不上钱，还不是要吃亏。”
    （十一）李四小互助组请技术能手王老汉指导锄苗，以提高组员们的锄苗技术。王老汉对大家说：“既怕迟种，更怕迟锄……”
    （十二）这时候，棉苗上突然发现棉蚜。李四小互助组赶快拿出余粮，又向银行贷了七十万元款，买了很多杀虫剂和九个喷雾器。看吧，他们正在棉田里消灭害虫哩。
