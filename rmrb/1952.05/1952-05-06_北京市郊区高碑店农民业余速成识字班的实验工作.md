The Experimental Work of the Gaobeidian Farmers' Amateur Accelerated Literacy Class in the Suburbs of Beijing

Under the direct guidance of the Central Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, the Gaobeidian Farmers' Amateur Accelerated Literacy Class in the suburbs of Beijing started on January 10th and ended on April 6th. Classes were held for two hours every night, with a total of 164 hours of actual instruction. (In addition to class time, students reviewed for approximately two hours each day outside of class.) The accelerated class had a total of twenty-six students, half men and half women, all young and middle-aged farmers. Their original education levels were as follows: five had studied half of the second volume of the Farmers' Literacy Textbook, fifteen had studied half of the first volume of the Farmers' Literacy Textbook, and six had never attended school. After three months of study, the students all recognized the 1,638 new characters in the Farmers' Literacy Textbook, and their literacy increased further while reading popular reading materials. They generally read picture books, "Learn Culture," "North China People," Current Affairs Small Series, China Youth Daily, and Zhao Shuli's "Family Treasure," among other popular reading materials. When copying new characters and doing homework, their characters were written very neatly. In terms of writing, they generally wrote more than twenty letters, each with three or four hundred characters, and could also write diaries and autobiographies.

The entire teaching process can be divided into three stages:

(1) 注音 (Zhuyin) Symbols and Pinyin Teaching: This stage of teaching took a total of sixteen hours. Only after the students passed each other's tests and assistance, and were able to "relocate" and recognize characters accurately, did they move on to Pinyin teaching.

The focus of Pinyin teaching is to master double-syllable Pinyin. When conducting Pinyin teaching, it is first necessary to explain the essentials of double-syllable Pinyin to the students—the first sound is light and short, and the second sound is heavy and slightly longer. Tell them that learning Pinyin well will allow them to learn all Chinese characters. When learning Pinyin, avoid using Chinese characters to mark the sounds next to the Zhuyin symbols; in this way, students are more likely to remember the Chinese characters and not learn Pinyin. After the students are relatively familiar with the method of double-syllable Pinyin, they enter the practice of three-syllable Pinyin. When learning three-syllable Pinyin, you can first use Comrade Qi Jianhua's method of "first spelling the first and second sounds, then combining with the third sound." After the students are relatively proficient, they can switch to the three-syllable method of "completing it in one breath, lightly and quickly." If this level can be reached—that is, the students initially dare not confirm the sound, but after the teacher's continuous patient help and encouragement, they can blurt out even three-syllable Pinyin and dare to confirm the sound—then you can move on to the stage of intensive learning of new characters.

(2) Intensive Study of New Characters: Massively studying new characters is the most intense stage of accelerated literacy teaching. This stage took a total of forty-eight hours. 1,638 new characters were recognized intensively.

We believe that the character list used for intensive study of new characters is best organized with words as the unit, turning the character list into a "word list." This can help students' memory, make it easier to explain the meaning of the characters, and also make the students' thinking more focused when intensively studying new characters. The words used for intensive study are best all new characters, or at least have one new character in them. These new characters can be arranged according to the order in which the new characters appear in the reading materials (we used the Farmers' Literacy Textbook), and the words composed of each new character are best selected from the original texts in which the character appears. Since students have many methods for remembering characters during intensive study, their experience can be absorbed, and the new characters that are not easy to form words can be arranged together with similar shapes. This can avoid many difficulties when reading.

At the beginning, we were not clear enough about this point. For the first three days, we intensively studied new characters based on phrases and longer words and sentences, causing students to develop tongue twisters. For example, when the teacher asked the students to recognize the character "国" (country) in the phrase "中华人民共和国万岁" (Long Live the People's Republic of China), they would slowly read "中—华—人—民—共—和" in a low voice first, and then shout out the character "国" loudly. When we changed to intensively studying new characters based on words as the unit, we also did not follow the above principles, resulting in many characters being repeated too many times in the compiled words, and some words did not conform to the spoken language of the masses, making the students feel "tongue-tied" when reading them. For example, "虚伪" (hypocrisy), "采取" (adopt), and "硬煤" (hard coal) were often read by the students as "伪甲长" (fake village head), "采桑" (picking mulberries), and "煤块" (coal lump).

The characteristics of farmers' amateur learning are: students are often disturbed by other things, their thoughts cannot be concentrated, and the learning time is scattered and prolonged. Based on this characteristic, we used the method of "intensive study by volume" to intensively study new characters. First, we intensively studied the 1,010 most commonly used characters. After the students could read "Learn Culture," we then intensively studied the other 628 characters in the Farmers' Literacy Textbook. After intensively studying the new characters in the three volumes of textbooks, we would read the three volumes of textbooks (and so on). This allows the intensively studied new characters to be initially consolidated.

The teaching steps when intensively studying new characters are: first, the teacher leads the students to spell and read the new characters and give a simple explanation; then, the students study and help each other on their own until they can freely read the sounds without Zhuyin symbols. Then, one or two students are spot-checked, or the group leader checks and compiles statistics, to check the teaching effect. The time for these three teaching steps each accounts for about one-third. The number of new characters intensively studied each night is generally around eighty.

When intensively studying new characters, it is necessary to deeply understand the students' methods of memorizing new characters. For example, some students remember the character "收" (receive) as "厶ㄥㄨ," and the character "定" (decide) as "宀下人." Some circle the word "捣蛋" (make trouble) and read it several times. This can enrich the teacher's teaching experience and encourage students' review enthusiasm. After intensively studying new characters by volume, avoid disrupting the character list for "review," because students have just acquired the sounds of the characters when intensively studying them, and it will be difficult to recognize them if they are disrupted. You should immediately move on to reading, giving full play to the advantages of adults' strong comprehension, judgment, and association abilities, and consolidate the sounds of the characters and acquire the shapes of the characters through reading.

(3) Reading: The Stage of Complementary Progress in Copying and Writing: After the students have intensively studied more than 1,600 new characters, a careful digestion process is necessary to develop from "knowing" to "mastering in four ways" on the basis of the students' initial acquisition of the sounds of the characters, so as to consolidate and improve their knowledge. In the process, on the one hand, it is still necessary to implement the principle of "dispersing the difficulty in mastering the four ways and gradually acquiring knowledge," and on the other hand, it is also necessary to implement the principle of "one link leading to another, with intersection and complementary progress." First, reading should be the main focus and copying the secondary focus, then copying should be the main focus and reading the secondary focus, and then reading and writing should progress simultaneously. This stage took a total of one hundred hours, including fifty-seven hours of reading, fourteen hours of copying (of which four students used twenty hours), and twenty-nine hours of writing.

When reading, the first step is to read the Farmers' Literacy Textbook, which is further divided into three small stages. We read the textbook once during the intensive study of new characters by volume. The purpose was to consolidate the sounds of the characters and not require students to read complete sentences and understand the content. We read fifteen to twenty-five lessons each day, and circled any unfamiliar characters and gave them to the teacher for intensive study again, or the students would mark the sounds next to the new characters. The second reading required a greater understanding of the meaning of the characters and the content of the text. During reading, the teacher should provide model readings or the top students should lead the reading. The reading volume is generally ten to fifteen lessons per day, five to eight lessons per hour. The teaching steps per hour are similar to those during the intensive study of new characters. The teacher leads the reading, the students study and help each other, and spot checks each account for one-third of the time. The third reading requires the teacher to provide key explanations, using the explanations to guide reading and using reading to guide writing. This small stage can be placed after copying single characters and texts. During key explanations, the main focus is on the texts related to language knowledge in the third and fourth volumes. For example, when reading the third volume, we explained the two lessons "Write Straightforwardly, Write Clearly" and "How to Write a Letter," and in conjunction with reading the text, we asked the students to understand the spirit of these two lessons, so that they could write letters. After reading the Farmers' Literacy Textbook fluently, we launched an activity to read popular reading materials.

We placed the copying time after the second reading. At this time, the students had initially consolidated their learning of the sounds of the characters and had initially acquired the shapes of the characters, laying a favorable foundation for writing. Before writing, we first told the students how to write characters: such as top to bottom, left to right, outside to inside, horizontal before vertical, and left-falling stroke before right-falling stroke. Second, the students must understand the radicals and components, and select and copy the same characters in order. This allows students to gradually and quickly learn the stroke order, from imitating writing stroke by stroke to copying part by part, and quickly master the method of writing characters and improve the speed of writing. At this stage, the students' copying speed is generally about two to four characters per minute.

On the basis of being able to recognize, read, and write, we can develop in the direction of "applying what you have learned." An imbalance in learning emerged among the students. At this time, students with poor learning performance can copy texts after copying single characters, and students with good learning performance can practice writing letters. The teacher should seize the opportunity to train the latter, using the snowball method to get the students to catch up one by one and ask to write letters. At this time, as mentioned above, you can take the approach of reading and writing advancing simultaneously, using reading to guide writing practice.

In writing, the first thing to do is to dispel the students' concerns and encourage them to dare to write. The best way to practice writing is to write letters. The teacher should give specific guidance and inspire the students' thinking, such as the teacher telling stories for the students to compile, or the students writing about things they are familiar with. If they find that there are ambiguous meanings in their writing, they should help them to "write straightforwardly and write clearly."

The main shortcoming in our teaching at this stage was that we did not plan to organize students to read popular reading materials, and we neglected reading in copying. As a result, a small number of students experienced a "regression" phenomenon. We spent a week making sentences before writing, such as filling in blanks and using words to make sentences, which the students found difficult. They said, "Writing letters is easy, making sentences is difficult."

Through this experiment, we have the following insights into conducting literacy teaching for farmers using the accelerated literacy method:

Conducting literacy teaching using the accelerated literacy method is a complex task. Before starting the class, it is necessary to gain the attention of the Party and Communist Youth League branches, village cadres, and students' families, and explain to the students the rationale for being able to learn quickly. During learning, it is necessary to dispel the students' doubts and concerns at any time. For example, they initially take a wait-and-see attitude. At the beginning of each teaching stage, they always doubt: "Can I still read?" "Can I still write characters?" "Can I still write letters?" The teacher must conduct persuasive education for the students to increase their confidence. For thoughts of arrogance and frivolousness and fear of difficulty and retreat, we must conduct specific criticism and assistance, and give full play to the role of counselors and group leaders, so that they can unite the backbone and lead the whole group to break through the "dead ends."

Secondly, it is necessary to implement the teaching method of the mass line in order to give fuller play to teaching efficiency. When conducting teaching, it is necessary to organize teaching research and absorb the participation of counselors, little teachers, and group leaders. After class, we must conduct frequent visits and, when necessary, hold review meetings. However, due to the high mobility of the teachers in this experiment, this work was not done well enough. Many problems were discovered after the fact, so we took some detours. For example, we approached the students with good grades more often and often prescribed the teaching progress according to their requirements, which made the students with poor grades feel that the progress was too fast.

Finally, it is necessary to grasp the characteristic that farmers are scattered small producers in order to determine the teaching method of amateur accelerated learning. As mentioned above, the method of intensive study by volume and the method of reading, writing, and speaking advancing in an intersecting way are determined based on this characteristic.

    北京市郊区高碑店农民业余速成识字班的实验工作
    土光
    北京市郊区高碑店农民业余速成识字班，在中央教育部、青年团中央和北京市人民政府文教局的直接指导下，于一月十日开学，四月六日结束。每晚上课两小时，实际上课共一百六十四小时。（除上课时间外，学员每天课外复习约两小时。）速成班共有学员二十六人，男女各半，都是青壮年农民。他们原来的文化程度是：有五个人念了农民识字课本第二册的半本，有十五个念了农民识字课本第一册的半本，有六个没念过书。经过三个月的学习，学员们都认识了农民识字课本中的一千六百三十八个生字，在阅读通俗读物中，识字数又都增加了一些。他们一般地都看过小人书、“学文化”、“华北人民”、时事小丛书、中国青年报及赵树理著的“传家宝”等通俗读物。在抄写生字和做课外作业时，字写得都很端正。在写作方面，一般地写了二十封以上的信，每封有三、四百字，还能写日记和自传。
    全部教学过程可分三个阶段：
    （一）注音符号和拼音教学：这一阶段的教学时间共用了十六小时。直到学员们经过互相考问、帮助，达到能够“搬家”、辨认无讹时，才转入拼音教学。
    拼音教学的重点是学好双拼音。在进行拼音教学时，首先要向学员讲清双拼音的要领——前音轻短，后音重而稍长。告诉他们学好拼音，就可以学习所有汉字。学拼音时，切忌在注音符号旁边用汉字标音，这样，学员容易记汉字而不学拼音。在学员较为熟悉了双拼音的方法后，即进入三拼音的练习。在学三拼音时，可先利用祁建华同志“先拼一、二音，再和三音拼”的方法，待学员较为熟练后，即可转入“一气呵成，又轻又捷”的三拼方法。如能达到这种程度：学员们由开始时的不敢肯定音，经过教师不断地耐心帮助和鼓励，达到连三拼音也能脱口而出，敢于肯定音，就可转入突击生字的阶段。
    （二）突击生字：大量突击生字，是进行速成识字教学中最紧张的阶段。这一阶段共用了四十八小时。突击认识了一千六百三十八个生字。
    突击生字时用的字表，我们以为最好以词为单位，把字表变为“词表”。这样可以帮助学员的记忆，使讲解字义时更为容易，也能使学员在突击生字时的思想更为集中。突击的词，最好全是生字，至少其中有一个是生字。这些生字，可以按照阅读教材（我们用的是农民识字课本）上生字出现的次序来排列，由每个生字所组成的词，最好从出现该生字的原课文中去挑选。由于学员自己在突击生字中有很多记字的方法，可以吸收他们的经验，把不易编成词的生字，再把字形相近的排列一起。这样，可以使阅读时免去很多困难。
    开始时，我们对这一点是不够明确的，最初三天，曾突击以短语和较长的词及句为单位的生字，造成学员顺口溜的现象。如教师问学员认识短语
    “中华人民共和国万岁”中的“国”字时，他就慢慢地先低读过“中—华—人—民—共—和”后，才大声地喊出一个“国”字来。在改成突击以词为单位的生字时，也未遵守上述原则，致编选的词中，有很多字重复次数太多，有些词不合群众的口语，学员们念起来感觉“绕嘴”。如“虚伪”、“采取”、“硬煤”等，学员就老念成“伪甲长”、“采桑”和“煤块”。
    农民业余学习的特点是：学生常被其它事情烦扰，思想不能集中，学习时间分散拖长。我们根据这个特点，就用“分册突击”的方法，来突击学习生字，首先突击了一千零十个最常用的字，等学员能读“学文化”以后，再突击学习农民识字课本中的另外六百二十八个字，突击完三册课本上的生字，就阅读三册课本（余类推）。这样，可以使突击过的生字，初步得到巩固。
    突击生字时的教学步骤，首先是由教师领导学生拼音，念生字，并给以简单的讲解，然后再由学生自学互助，达到能离开注音符号，自由地念出音来。然后又抽查一两个学生，或由组长检查统计，以检查教学效果。这三个教学步骤的时间，约各占三分之一。每晚突击生字数，一般是八十个左右。
    在突击生字时，要深入了解学员记生字的办法。如有的学员把“收”字记成“厶ㄥㄨ”，“定”字记成“宀下人”，有的把“捣蛋”字圈出来多念几遍，这样，可以丰富老师的教学经验，鼓励学生的复习情绪。分册突击学习生字以后，切忌打乱字表进行“复习”，因为突击学习生字时，学员刚刚占有字音，打乱了就很难认识。应该马上转入阅读，发挥成年人理解力、判断力和联想力强的优点，在阅读中巩固字音，占有字形。
    （三）阅读：抄写和写话相辅并进阶段：在学员突击了一千六百多个生字以后，来一个细嚼的消化过程，在学员初步占有字音的基础上，由“一会”向“四会”发展，使之巩固提高，是完全必要的。在进行中，一方面仍要贯彻“分散四会难点，逐步占有”的原则，同时，也要贯彻“一环套一环，交叉与相辅并进”的原则。首先要以阅读为主，抄写为副，然后再以抄写为主，阅读为副，进而阅读和写话并进。这一阶段共用了一百小时，计阅读五十七小时，抄写十四小时（其中有四个学员用了二十小时），写话二十九小时。
    阅读时，首先是阅读农民识字课本，其中又分三个小阶段。在分册突击生字中，曾阅读一次课本，目的在于巩固字音，不要求学员读成句和了解内容。每天读十五课到二十五课不等，遇到不认识的字就圈下来，交给教师，重新突击，或由学生在生字旁边注上音。第二次阅读，要求更多地了解字义和课文内容。在阅读时，要由教师作示范诵读，或优等生领读。阅读分量一般是每天十课到十五课，每小时五课至八课。每小时的教学步骤和突击生字时差不多。教员领读，学员自读互助和抽查各占三分之一。第三次阅读，要由教师进行重点讲解，用讲解指导阅读，通过阅读来指导写作。这一小阶段，可以放在抄写单字和课文以后。在重点讲解时，主要是讲三、四册中有关语文知识的课文。如在读第三册时，讲了两课“照直写，写明白”和“怎样写信”，并结合阅读课文，让学生了解这两课课文的精神，就可让他们写信。在熟读过农民识字课本后，我们又展开了一次阅读通俗读物的活动。
    我们把抄写时间放在第二次阅读以后，这时学员已能初步地巩固了学习字音的成绩，并初步占有了字形，给写字打下有利的基础。在未写字以前，先告诉学员写字的方法：如先上后下，先左后右，先外后内，先横后竖，先撇后捺等。其次，要学员懂得偏旁和部首，把相同的字依次选出来抄写。这样可以使学员逐渐地而又很快地学会笔顺，由写字时
    一笔一笔地照猫画虎，到一部分一部分地照着抄写，很快掌握住写字的方法，提高写字的速度。这
    一阶段学生们抄写的速度，一般地是每分钟抄写两个字到四个字左右。
    在已能认、读、写的基础上，就可以向“学以致用”的方向发展。学员在学习中出现了不平衡的状态，这时，学习差的学员可以在抄写单字后抄写课文，学习好的学员可以练习写信；教员要抓紧培养后者，用滚雪球的办法，使学员一个一个地跟上来要求写信。这时，如上所述，就可以采取阅读和写话齐头并进的办法，用阅读指导写话练习。
    在写话中，首先要打破学员的顾虑，让他们敢于写话。写话练习中最好的办法是写信，教员要给学员具体指导，启发学员思想，如教员讲故事，由学员编写，或由学员写自己熟悉的事情。发现他们写的有语意模糊的地方，便要帮助他们，把事实“照直写，写明白”。
    我们在这一阶段的教学中，主要的缺点是没有有计划地组织学员阅读通俗读物，在抄写中忽视阅读。因此，少部分学员有“回生”现象，在写话前搞了一个星期的造句，如填空白、用词造句等，学员感到困难。他们说：“写信容易造句难。”
    通过这一次实验，我们对在农民中用速成识字法进行识字教学，有以下几点体会：
    用速成识字法进行识字教学，是一件复杂的工作。在开班以前，要使得党和青年团支部、村干部、学员家属的重视，要向学员讲清能够速成的道理。在学习中，要随时解除学员的怀疑和顾虑。如他们开始时抱着试试看的态度，每一教学阶段开始时，他们总是怀疑：“我还能看书？”“我还能写字？”“我还能写信？”教员就必须向学员进行说服教育，提高他们的信心。对于自大轻浮和畏难退缩的思想，要进行具体的批评和帮助；发挥辅导员和小组长的作用，让他们团结骨干，带动全组，突破“死角”。
    其次，必需贯彻群众路线的教学方法，才能更高地发挥教学效率。在进行教学时，要组织教学研究，吸收辅导员、小先生、小组长参加；课后要经常地进行访问，必要时开检讨会。但我们这次的实验由于教员的流动性较大，这一工作做得不够好。很多问题都在事后发现，因此走了些弯路。如我们接近成绩好的学员较多，常根据他们的要求来规定教学进度，使成绩差的学员感到进度太快。
    最后，要掌握农民是分散的小生产者这一特点，来确定业余速成的教学方法。如前述的分册突击，阅读、写字和写话要交叉前进的方法，就是根据这一特点来确定的。
