    Corrects "Chemical World's" Neglect of Political Tendencies

    To the Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on April 10th published Comrade Tian Yuan's criticism of "Chemical World," pointing out that "Chemical World" has a tendency to neglect politics. This criticism is correct. We held a meeting and conducted a more in-depth review of this. We realize that "Chemical World" in the past simply introduced production knowledge, neglecting the political education role that a people's publication should have, which is entirely an erroneous manifestation of a purely technical viewpoint and "above politics" thinking. Some papers, due to incorrect content and viewpoints, unconsciously promoted capitalist countries. This could lead "Chemical World" readers down the same erroneous path of detachment from politics, which we should correct.

    Starting from Volume 7, Issue 1, we have made some improvements to the content of "Chemical World," but after careful examination, we realize that those improvements are still superficial. This is because our purely technical viewpoint has not been completely transformed. We are deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology, and we have not worked hard to learn, so we have failed to establish the viewpoint that scientific and technological work should serve the people. In the future, we will seriously study, improve our political awareness, and correct these errors through practice to do a good job in the people's publishing work.

    纠正“化学世界”忽视政治倾向
    编辑同志：人民日报四月十日“读者来信”栏刊载了田员同志对“化学世界”的批评，指出“化学世界”有忽视政治的倾向。这个批评是正确的。我们曾召开了会议，对此作了比较深入的检讨。我们认识到“化学世界”过去单纯介绍生产知识，忽视了人民的刊物应有的政治教育作用，完全是一种纯技术观点和“超政治”思想的错误表现。有些论文，由于内容和观点错误，不知不觉地为资本主义国家作了宣传。这都可能引导“化学世界”的读者，同样地走上脱离政治的错误道路，我们是应当加以纠正的。
    从七卷一期起，我们对于“化学世界”的内容，虽作了一些改进，但是现在仔细检查起来，才知道那样的改进还是浮浅的。这是因为我们的纯技术观点还没有完全转变过来。我们受资产阶级的思想影响较深，自己又不努力学习，所以就未能确立科学技术工作应为人民服务的观点。今后我们当认真学习，提高政治认识，并通过实践来纠正这些错误，做好人民的出版工作。
