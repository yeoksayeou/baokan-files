    Zhangjiakou Municipal Workers' Club Arouses Worker Dissatisfaction with Obscene Songs as Dance Music
    On March 29th, during a dance party at the Zhangjiakou Municipal Workers' Club, they actually played the obscene song "Red Lights and Green Wine Nights." Comrade Jiang Chengxin of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau raised objections on the spot, but the club staff not only did not accept this correct opinion, but also played the obscene song "Eternal Smile," arousing the dissatisfaction of many workers. I believe that dancing is a legitimate form of cultural entertainment, and should be accompanied by songs that are beneficial to the body and mind.
    The club played unhealthy dance music, and when others raised objections, they not only did not humbly correct themselves, but continued to play it. This is very wrong.

    张家口市职工俱乐部以黄色歌曲伴舞引起职工不满
    三月二十九日，张家口市职工俱乐部的跳舞晚会中，竟弹奏黄色歌曲《红灯绿酒夜》。张家口铁路分局姜承信同志当场提出意见，而该俱乐部工作人员，不但不接受这一正确的意见，却又弹奏黄色歌曲《永远的微笑》，引起许多职工的不满。我认为，跳舞是一种正当的文化娱乐，应该伴奏一些有益于身心的歌曲才好。
    该俱乐部弹奏不健康的舞曲，别人提出意见，不但不虚心改正，反而继续弹奏，这是很不对的。
