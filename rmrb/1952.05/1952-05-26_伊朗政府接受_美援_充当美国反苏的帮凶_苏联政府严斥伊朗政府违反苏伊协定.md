Xinhua News Agency, May 24th dispatch: TASS, Moscow, May 23rd: On May 21st, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky handed the Soviet government's note to the Iranian government to Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Alast, regarding the exchange of letters between Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh and the US Ambassador to Iran, Henderson, at the end of April this year on the issue of resuming so-called "aid" from the US to Iran. The full text of the note is as follows:

    "Regarding the exchange of letters between Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh and US Ambassador to Iran Henderson at the end of April 1952 on the issue of the United States of America giving so-called 'aid' to Iran, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics hereby notifies the Iranian government as follows:

    It can be seen from the aforementioned exchange of letters that the Iranian government and the US government have reached an agreement on the issue of the United States of America giving Iran military and financial aid, and the Iranian government has undertaken definite military and political obligations.

    According to Iranian newspaper reports and statements by representatives of the Iranian and US governments, in accordance with this agreement, the Iranian government must re-sign contracts with American military advisors. This is also confirmed by the official statement of the Iranian Minister of Transportation, Bushili, on April 27th this year and the official statement of the US Assistant Secretary of State McDermott on April 25th this year. It is also well known that after the exchange of letters between Prime Minister Mossadegh and Henderson, the US military delegation, which had originally ceased its activities in January of this year, resumed its work, and at the same time, the agreement between the US and Iran on military aid and the US military delegation in Iran, dated May 23, 1950, was reinstated.

    In this way, due to the aforementioned exchange of letters and the reinstatement of the Iranian-US military agreement, the Iranian government has placed the Iranian army under the control of the US government. The Iranian army has therefore ceased to be the army of a sovereign and independent country.

    The Soviet government deems it necessary to draw the Iranian government's attention to the fact that the Iranian government's agreement to accept so-called US aid, and its undertaking of definite military obligations to the US government in this regard, actually constitutes the beginning of assistance to the US government in realizing its aggressive plans against the Soviet Union.

    This action by the Iranian government can only be regarded as an action that contradicts the provisions on good-neighborly relations in the Soviet-Iranian Treaty of February 26, 1921, and it is the responsibility of both contracting parties to maintain and consolidate such relations."

    The Iranian ambassador promised to forward this note to the Iranian government.

    伊朗政府接受“美援”充当美国反苏的帮凶
    苏联政府严斥伊朗政府违反苏伊协定
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日讯：五月二十一日，苏联外交部长维辛斯基将苏联政府致伊朗政府的照会一件交给伊朗驻苏大使阿拉斯特，这个照会是关于今年四月底伊朗首相摩萨台和美国驻伊朗大使韩德逊就恢复美国对伊朗的所谓“援助”问题交换信件一事的照会。照会全文如下：
    “关于一九五二年四月底伊朗首相摩萨台先生与美国驻伊朗大使韩德逊先生就美利坚合众国给予伊朗所谓‘援助’问题交换信件一事，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部谨通知伊朗政府如下：
    从上述交换信件一事可以看出，伊朗政府与美国政府已就美利坚合众国给予伊朗以军事及财政援助问题取得协议，伊朗政府并已担负确定的军事性与政治性的义务。
    根据伊朗报纸的消息以及伊朗政府和美国政府代表的声明可以知道，按照这个协定，伊朗政府必须和美国军事顾问重新签订契约。伊朗交通大臣布施利今年四月二十七日的正式声明以及美国助理国务卿麦克德谟今年四月二十五日的正式声明，都同样证实了这一点。大家也都知道，摩萨台首相和韩德逊先生交换信件之后，原来已在今年一月停止活动的美国军事代表团又恢复了工作，同时，一九五○年五月二十三日美国和伊朗间关于军事援助和美国驻伊朗军事代表团的协定又重新生效。
    这样，由于上述的交换信件和伊美军事协定之重新生效，伊朗政府就把伊朗军队交给了美国政府控制。伊朗军队因此便不复成为主权独立的国家的军队。
    苏联政府认为必须提起伊朗政府注意：伊朗政府同意接受所谓美国的援助，并在这方面向美国政府承担了确定的军事性的义务，实际上就是开始帮助美国政府实现其对苏联的侵略计划。
    伊朗政府这种行动只能被认为是抵触一九二一年二月二十六日的苏伊协定中有关睦邻关系条款的行动，而维持并巩固这种关系乃是缔约双方的责任。”
    伊朗大使答应把这照会转交伊朗政府。
