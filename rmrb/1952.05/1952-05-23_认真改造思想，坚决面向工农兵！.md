Conscientiously Remold Ideology, Resolutely Serve the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers!
　　Mao Dun

　　Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published in May 1942, and it marks its tenth anniversary. This historical document is another brilliant example of the high integration of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution. It criticized several principled shortcomings of the revolutionary literary and art movement from the "May Fourth" Movement to 1942. It clarified the various non-proletarian confused literary and artistic thoughts that still appeared in the literary world until that period (May 1942). It thoroughly solved a series of major principled problems that had been disputed for a long time in the literary world. It clearly pointed out that literature and art should serve the people, and first of all, should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In order to achieve this goal, literary and art workers must transform their ideology, and to transform their ideology, they must devote themselves wholeheartedly to the real struggle of the revolution. The publication of this document was a great revolution in China's literary and art circles and also in China's cultural circles.

　　Before the publication of this document, China's revolutionary literature and art were not without achievements, but from the perspective of creative methods, they mainly belonged to the category of critical realism. After the publication of this document, a new era of revolutionary realism began: "The White-Haired Girl," "Li Youcai's Ditties," "The Sun Shines on the Sanggan River," "The Storm" … and so on, are the milestones of this new era. The greatness of this document, its significance, is not limited to this. Not only is it the highest guiding principle for our country's literary and art work today, but it will also be the highest guiding principle for literary and art work when our country enters the socialist stage in the future. Its dialectical solution to the problem of popularization and improvement, its correct instruction on the standards of literary and art criticism, its thorough criticism of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts, and its valuable instructions on the ideological transformation of literary and art workers, and the united front of literary and art circles, etc., are not only classic in China but also in other countries where there is a struggle between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary literature and art.

　　Facts have proved that anyone, any region, who can truly understand and resolutely implement the Mao Zedong literary and artistic thought and literary and artistic policy encompassed in this historical document will not make mistakes in their work and will achieve results. Otherwise, they will definitely make mistakes or do a bad job. Therefore, just as the national literary and art circles are celebrating the tenth anniversary of this historical document, it is necessary for us to examine our work, our literary and artistic thoughts, and to intensify the study of this historical document.

　　It must be admitted that there is still a state of serious ideological confusion in our literary and art circles, and our work still has serious errors or shortcomings. Some were exposed during the literary and art rectification study last year, and then some were exposed during the Three-Anti Movement. There are many reasons for these errors, but the main reason is that we do not understand Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy well enough, we only understand it vaguely, and we think we understand it, so we often have deviations or errors in implementing the policy. The reason why these deviations or errors can occur is mainly because we cannot resolutely implement the policy of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers." In the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao pointed out that the question of "for whom" "seems to have been resolved among comrades engaged in literary and artistic work in our various anti-Japanese base areas, ... but in fact, many comrades have not clearly resolved this question." Now we can also say that among us, even today, there are still many comrades who have not clearly resolved this question. Secondly, there is the question of "how to serve." We are all shouting "popularization first" in words, saying
　　"Our improvement is based on popularization, and our popularization is under the guidance of improvement." But the actual performance in our work proves that we either despise popularization, or distort popularization, or vulgarize popularization, or divide popularization and improvement into two separate things, "you do popularization, I do improvement," and even think of going to bourgeois literature and art to find
　　"improvement"... etc., a series of errors are constantly occurring.

　　In the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao repeatedly warned: The question of for whom is the fundamental question; and in order to stand firm on the
　　"for whom" position and do a good job of "for whom" work, literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois origins must undergo ideological transformation. If any of us have not read the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," or have not memorized this passage, it is inconceivable; however, the problem is not whether we have read it, or whether we have memorized the document, but whether we can follow the instructions of the document and work hard. Chairman Mao warned us: If literary and art workers want to truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, they must first devote themselves to the real struggle of the revolution to transform their thoughts and emotions, and at the same time, they must study Marxism-Leninism and society. He also said that this so-called "Marxism-Leninism is living Marxism-Leninism that is completely applicable in the lives and struggles of the masses, not just Marxism-Leninism in books." Therefore, the core of the problem lies in whether we are wholeheartedly devoted to the real struggle of the revolution. Today, no one would say in words that they do not agree with wholeheartedly devoting themselves to the real struggle of the revolution, but perhaps not all those who actually "devote themselves to the real struggle of the revolution" are "wholeheartedly." At this time, for this matter, it may be wholeheartedly; but at that time, for that matter, it may not be wholeheartedly, but only half-heartedly. What does it mean to be wholeheartedly? It means having no personal plans at all, standing firm on the position of serving the people, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, resolutely opposing everything that is detrimental to the people, and not having the slightest attitude of reconciliation, compromise, or sympathy. If we cannot do this, then we can only say that we are "half-heartedly," that although we are involved in the real struggle of the revolution, we are actually always in the position of bystanders; the attitude of bystanders will seriously hinder the transformation of our ideology!

　　We should admit this fact: Most intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins are mental laborers. In the old society, they were often threatened by unemployment, their lives were not very stable, their economy was not very affluent, and they were even often on the verge of starvation. This situation determined that most intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins were dissatisfied with the old society and had revolutionary demands. A part of the intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins—literary and art workers—in the past, in the old society, their lives were more unstable and they were more often threatened by unemployment than intellectuals engaged in other professions. This situation shows that literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois origins are revolutionary. In fact, a considerable part of the literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois origins participated in the revolutionary movement. But it is also because of this that literary and art workers and other intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins hold more or less resistance in their minds to the issue of "ideological transformation": "I have always been a mental laborer, I have not exploited anyone, and I have always had revolutionary demands. Am I not a part of the working people? Why do I still need to undergo ideological transformation?" In other words, they do not admit in their minds that they have non-proletarian ideologies, and therefore they do not consciously need ideological transformation. However, such thinking is wrong. Because, "there is no economic antagonism between intellectuals and the proletariat. But their living conditions and working conditions are non-proletarian, so there is considerable antagonism in terms of psychology and thought." (Lenin) Petty-bourgeois intellectuals are like this: on the one hand, they are easily receptive to revolution, but on the other hand, in terms of ideology, they have considerable antagonism with the proletariat. Anyone who does not admit this fact, even if they have participated in the revolution, even if they have devoted themselves to the real struggle, I am afraid that they will gain very little in ideological transformation; if they are literary and art workers, then it is impossible to truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　The above two situations—not being able to wholeheartedly devote oneself to the real struggle and not admitting in one's mind that one has non-proletarian ideologies—are common problems of literary and art workers from petty-bourgeois origins, and they are also the biggest stumbling blocks in our ideological transformation process. Facts that have been discovered one after another recently tell us that even if one lives among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and devotes oneself to the real struggle for a long time, but one's ideology has not been thoroughly transformed, then when the environment changes, one cannot withstand the erosion of bourgeois thought, and one will lose one's position and make big mistakes. We should learn lessons from such facts and keenly realize that ideological transformation is a long-term and arduous process. If we only go to the countryside for a few months or into the factory for half a year, and then think that the transformation has been successful and become complacent, it is very dangerous. How well we have been transformed will only be revealed when we encounter the test of specific problems. For literary and art workers, if they are engaged in creation, their works are the test. If literary writers want to check whether their ideology has been transformed, the best way is to constantly write, and conscientiously conduct criticism and self-criticism. Writing—criticism and self-criticism—going deeper into life again, learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers—writing again—conducting criticism and self-criticism again—going deeper into life again... By repeating this cycle, the process of ideological transformation can gradually reach a thorough and complete state.

　　Someone raised such a question: "When I read other people's works, I can often see some problems and point out those places that are not proletarian ideologies, but when I write myself, although I will not write characters whose clothing is workers, peasants, and soldiers but whose thoughts and emotions are petty-bourgeois, but when I compare them with real people (combat heroes, model workers, etc.) in real life, I feel that they are too far apart. In simple terms, the work lacks profound ideological content. What is the reason for this? Is this because my ideology has not been transformed well enough, so I cannot write works with a high degree of ideological content?"

　　This question has a universal nature, and many people suffer from it. This is called "eyes high, hands low" in Chinese idiom. It should be said that if a writer's eyes are not high, it is dangerous; there will never be a writer with low eyes and high hands (that is, who cannot see the problems in other people's works, but their own works have no problems). On the contrary, high eyes are the prerequisite for making the hands high as well. The question is how to make the hands high as well. So, what does "hand" actually refer to? Some people think it refers to writing skills, and they oppose "eyes" and "hands," saying
　　"Eyes" are high enough (that is, the ideology is high enough), now we just need to raise the
　　"hand" (that is, improve skills). I think such a statement is not entirely true, and it is harmful. Why is it not entirely true? Because the root cause of the lack of ideological content in the work, or the low ideological content, lies in the writer's lack of a high degree of ideological ability—that is, observation and analysis are not sharp, profound, and comprehensive enough, not a matter of skill; skill is secondary and partial here. Why is it harmful? Because the incorrect tendencies of simply pursuing skills, opposing skills and thought, etc., are mostly caused by this. The correct solution to the problem has already been pointed out in the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This is to study Marxism-Leninism and to study society. "Literary and art workers should study literary and artistic creation, that's right, but Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers cannot be an exception. In addition, they must also study society, that is, to study the various classes in society, their interrelationships and individual conditions, their faces and their psychology." It also says: "Studying Marxism-Leninism is only to ask us to observe the world, observe society, and observe literature and art from the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, not to ask us to write philosophical lectures in literary and artistic works. Marxism-Leninism can only include realism in literary and artistic creation, not replace it, just as it can only include the theory of atoms and electrons in physics, not replace it." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, we know that the ideological transformation of intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins is the first step, which is to establish a position of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers; without this position, or if we have it but it is not firm, then although we also shout about serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in words, what we actually do is not the same thing; however, having this position does not mean that we have Marxism-Leninism, we still need to study Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism is a science that all revolutionaries should study, and literary and art workers cannot be an exception, and because literary and art workers describe and express social living people and things, literary and art workers cannot but study society. To study society is to study the various classes in society, their interrelationships and individual conditions, their faces and their psychology, and in order to do this research profoundly and comprehensively, we must have the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism.

　　In this way, the "eyes high, hands low" problem mentioned above
　　precisely illustrates that although this particular author's ideology has been transformed, he is not good at observing society from the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism; the problem lies here, and not in what he raised: "Is it because the ideology has not been transformed well enough?" The so-called someone's ideology has not been transformed well means that there are still non-proletarian ideologies in his mind, which is reflected in the work as a question of whether there are principled errors, and there is no question of whether the ideological content is high or not. When we say that a certain work has low ideological content, we mean that this work has no principled errors, but its observation and analysis are not comprehensive and profound enough, and the question it raises does not touch the core of social contradictions, it cannot distinguish between major and secondary contradictions, and it cannot express the universality of contradictions on the one hand, and the particularity of contradictions on the other hand, and it cannot express the identity and struggle of all aspects of contradictions. A writer from a proletarian origin, if he does not study Marxism-Leninism and is not good at using the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to observe society, he may not be able to write works with high ideological content. However, the issue of ideological transformation is a matter of determining a position for petty-bourgeois intellectuals or literary and art workers, so it should be a prior issue; because "without this transformation, nothing can be done well."

　　The "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" gave clear instructions on the issues of "for whom" and "how to serve" in light of the ideological situation and shortcomings in practical work in the literary and art circles at that time. In Chairman Mao's two philosophical papers "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," published in July and August 1937, they contain the most basic issues of realistic creative methods. We who are engaged in literary and art work must certainly study the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," but "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" must also be studied; if we think that these two are philosophical papers, and I am engaged in literature and art, and they have nothing to do with me, then we are wrong. We have some life experience, aren't we often troubled by
　　"can't organize it," troubled by not knowing how to "summarize," "refine," "prune," so when writing, we inevitably enumerate phenomena, inevitably write realistically in a photographic style, inevitably write only the surface phenomena of life and lack perspective, inevitably drill into a corner and cannot have a bird's-eye view of the overall situation... etc.? Studying "On Practice" can solve this series of problems. "On Practice" tells us that when we go to life, what we get first is perceptual knowledge; the so-called perceptual knowledge is the superficial knowledge of individual things, this kind of knowledge is one-sided, partial, and cannot go from the phenomena of things to the essence of things and the laws of their development; this kind of perceptual knowledge may sometimes give us a false impression that seems right. Therefore, we cannot be satisfied with obtaining perceptual knowledge, we must go further and raise perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. The so-called rational knowledge is the knowledge of the whole, essence, and internal connection of things, that is, the relatively comprehensive and in-depth knowledge of things. After raising it to rational knowledge, we can see the connections of all aspects and the inevitable laws of development of the complex, intricate, and constantly changing social phenomena. Therefore, rational knowledge and perceptual knowledge "are not only different in quantity, but also in quality." However, rational knowledge must have rich perceptual knowledge as a foundation. Without rich perceptual experience as a foundation, it is impossible to extract the knowledge of laws that can summarize the whole of things. In literary writing, we can take the creation of typical characters as an example. To create a typical character of a certain class, we must carefully observe at least a dozen people living different lives in the same class, and then we can summarize them and create a typical character of this class. Here, the first step is to obtain rich perceptual knowledge, and the second step is to raise this perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge, which is what we call "summarization." After obtaining rational knowledge, we must also take it to practice for inspection and development in order to obtain correct knowledge that conforms to objective truth. In literary writing, this is the repeated process of writing and life experience, and cyclical assessment. Only in the process of writing practice can we truly assess whether our understanding is comprehensive and in-depth, that is, whether perceptual knowledge has been raised to rational knowledge; and only after creative practice and then returning to life for deep experience can we assess whether our rational knowledge truly conforms to objective truth—that is, the laws of development of social reality. The reason why the two must be carried out repeatedly lies in this. If we simply think that the previous life experience has already been written, so the second time we go to life to experience is to obtain new writing materials, such thinking is wrong.

　　Although perceptual knowledge is the first step in the process of cognition, this step must not be skipped. Skipping this step will inevitably lead to empty, dry, and fleshless conceptualized works in literary creation. On the contrary, holding a large amount of perceptual knowledge and stopping there will lead to falling into the pit of naturalism in literary creation. Conceptualized works are the product of dogmatism. The mistake of dogmatists lies in not admitting the necessity of starting from perceptual knowledge, and not admitting the necessity of taking rational knowledge to practice for assessment and inspection. Naturalism in works is the product of empiricism. The mistake of empiricists lies in having rich life experience (perceptual knowledge), but not raising it to rational knowledge. In addition to conceptualization and naturalistic tendencies, there is also a fairly common problem in our literary and art circles, which is formularization. If we explain it in detail, it is that when writing about the struggle between the new and the old, and when writing about the process of backwardness and transformation, we are not good at combining the universality and particularity of contradictions, we are not good at reflecting from the individual to the whole (although what is written is limited to individual things, the gaze is radiant, so that the reader's understanding is not limited to this individual thing), nor are we good at distinguishing and analyzing major and secondary contradictions... etc., thus making the characters and stories fall into the rut of formularization. Such formularized works and conceptualized or naturalistic works have superficial and partial similarities, but they are essentially different from conceptualized or naturalistic works. (Of course, works that are formularized and further stereotyped into formulaic works have no essential difference from conceptualized works. The authors of such works have no life experience themselves, and only use the writing methods of the struggle between the new and the old, the process of backwardness and transformation, etc. in other people's works as formulas, and fabricate characters and stories, and forcibly put them together to form a piece.) The reason why formularized works are produced is mainly because the author, although possessing rich life experience, is not good at (does not know how to) raise this perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge. What "On Practice" instructs us is how to correctly exert our thinking, how to carry out "the work of transformation and production of eliminating the crude and selecting the fine, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding from this to that, and proceeding from the outside to the inside" on perceptual knowledge, and the fundamental method is to thoroughly reveal the contradictions of all aspects of objective things from rich perceptual materials. Studying "On Contradiction" will enable us to master the basic method of "studying society."

　　First of all, we must know: "The fundamental reason for the development of things is not in the external environment of things but in the internal environment of things, in the contradictoriness of things. Everything has this contradictoriness, and therefore causes the movement and development of things. This contradictoriness inside the things is the fundamental reason for the development of things, and the interrelationship and mutual influence between one thing and other things is the secondary reason for the development of things." Since the objects of study of literary and art workers are the social life of all kinds, changing rapidly, they need to understand: "The changes in society are mainly due to the development of contradictions within society, that is, the contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production, the contradictions between classes, and the contradictions between the old and the new. The development of these contradictions has promoted the advancement of society and the metabolism of the old and new societies." Therefore, expressing contradictions and resolving contradictions is an indispensable basic task of a literary work. Works that do not express contradictions are not realistic, because real life is full of contradictions.

　　But there is the universality of contradictions, and there is also the particularity of contradictions. If we see the universality of contradictions but not the particularity of contradictions, that is, if we only observe the overall things in general (for example, when entering a factory, we only contact the general manager's office or the executive committee of the trade union and the leading cadres), and do not go deep into the local (for example, go deep into the workshops, groups and individual workers), and do not reveal the local things that have a decisive significance, then the work will only express the universality of contradictions. However, "the contradictions in various forms of material movement have particularity", and if the work only expresses the universality of contradictions, it will inevitably lead to the error of one-sidedness in the life it expresses. "Not understanding the characteristics of each party of the contradiction", for example, only understanding the proletariat, not understanding the bourgeoisie, only understanding the peasants
　　one party, not understanding the landlords one party, ... etc., this is called looking at the problem one-sidedly. Or, "not looking at the characteristics of the contradiction as a whole and the characteristics of each party of the contradiction, denying the necessity of studying the characteristics of the contradiction in detail inside things, just standing there and looking from a distance, seeing a little of the shape of the contradiction roughly, and wanting to solve the contradiction", this is called looking at the problem superficially. All kinds of conceptualization and formularization problems of various kinds and to various degrees in literary creation are related to the author's one-sided or superficial view of the problem. Chairman Mao summarized the relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction as follows: "The relationship between the universality of contradiction and the particularity of contradiction is the relationship between the commonality and individuality of contradiction. Its commonality is that contradiction exists in all processes and runs through the whole process... so it is commonality, it is absoluteness. However, this commonality is included in all individuality, and there is no commonality without individuality. ... Because each contradiction is special, individuality is created. All individuality exists conditionally and temporarily, so it is relative." This passage is extremely important for literary and art workers. If a work can express the commonality and individuality of contradiction, it is a work with a high degree of ideological content.

　　In addition, in the occasion where most contradictions exist together, there are major contradictions and secondary contradictions. What is the main contradiction? "If there are many contradictions in any process, there must be one that is the main one, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are in a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, in studying any process, ... we must use all our strength to find its main contradiction." But "the main and non-main aspects of contradiction transform each other, and the nature of things changes accordingly." The reason why the formularization of works is produced also lies in the fact that it does not analyze the major and secondary aspects of the majority of contradictions, and thus does not show the mutual transformation of the major and non-major aspects of contradictions.

　　As mentioned above, the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" instructs us that we must first solve the question of "for whom", and secondly the question of "how to serve". If we really want to solve these problems, we must carry out ideological transformation, and our work direction is only one direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. And the problem of "studying society," which belongs to the basic principles of realistic creative methods, which was not elaborated in detail in the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," has the most detailed and incisive instructions in "On Practice" and "On
Contradiction." These three documents are the classics of our Marxist-Leninist literary theory. We have such a profound and broad guiding theory, and we have the help of the government, giving us various convenient conditions to transform our ideology and experience life, and we are in such a vigorous, glorious and colorful great era, our conditions are really the best, if we still cannot do the work commensurate with this great era, we cannot blame others, we can only blame ourselves.

　　Let us make up our minds to do two things at this tenth anniversary of the publication of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": 1. Go deep into the struggle life of the masses and conscientiously transform our ideology; 2. Learn humbly and diligently from society and resolutely implement the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers!

专栏：

    认真改造思想，坚决面向工农兵！
    茅　盾
    毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，发表于一九四二年五月，到现在恰满十周年。这一个历史文件，是马克思列宁主义和中国革命实践高度结合的又一光辉的典范。它批判了自“五四”以至一九四二年这一长时期内的革命文艺运动的若干原则性的缺陷，它澄清了直到那时期（一九四二年五月）还出现于文坛上的各种各样的非无产阶级的混乱的文艺思想，它彻底地解决了文坛上长期纷争而未决的一系列的原则性的重大问题，它明确地指示了文艺应该为人民服务，首先应该为工农兵服务，而为要达到这个目的，文艺工作者就必须改造自己的思想意识，而要改造自己的思想意识就必须全身心投入于革命的现实斗争。这一文件的发表，在我国文艺界是一次大革命，在我国文化界，也是一次大革命。
    在这文件发表以前，中国的革命文艺不是没有成就的，然而从创作方法上看，主要是属于批判的现实主义的范畴；在这文件发表以后呢，开始了革命的现实主义的新时代：“白毛女”，“李有才板话”，“太阳照在桑乾河上”，“暴风骤雨”……等等，就是这新时代的纪程碑。这一文件之伟大，其意义，还不止于此；它不但在今天是我国文艺工作的最高指导原则，即在将来我国进入社会主义阶段时，也同样是文艺工作的最高指导原则；它的对于普及和提高问题之辩证的解决，对于文艺批判标准之正确的指示，对于资产阶级和小资产阶级文艺思想之透彻的批判，以及对于文艺工作者思想改造问题，文艺界统一战线问题等等的宝贵指示，不但在中国是经典性的，即在其他凡有革命文艺和反革命文艺之斗争的国家内，也是经典性的。
    事实证明，任何人，任何地区，对于这一历史文件所包举的毛泽东文艺思想和文艺方针，如果能真正体会，坚决执行，那他在工作中就不会犯错误，就会做出成绩；反之，就一定会犯错误，或把工作做坏。因此，正当全国文艺界一致庆祝这一历史文件十周年纪念的时候，让我们来检查自己的工作，自己的文艺思想，来加紧对于这一历史文件的学习，是必要的。
    毋庸讳言，我们文艺界还存在着性质严重的思想混乱状态，我们的工作还有严重的错误或缺点，去年文艺整风学习时已经暴露了若干，接着在三反运动中又暴露了若干。造成这些错误的原因是很多的，但主要原因是我们对于毛主席的文艺方针理解得不够，似懂非懂，自以为懂，因而在执行政策时，常有偏差或错误。而推究这些偏差或错误之所以能发生，主要又由于我们不能坚决执行“为工农兵”的方针。“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”内，毛主席曾经指出，“为什么人”这个问题，“在我们各个抗日根据地从事文学艺术工作的同志中，似乎是已经解决了，……其实不然，很多同志对这个问题并没有得到明确的解决。”现在我们也可以说，我们之间，直到今天，也还有很多同志对这个问题并没有得到明确的解决。其次是“如何为法”的问题，我们口头上谁也在喊着“普及第一”，在说
    “我们的提高，是在普及基础上的提高，我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”但实际工作上的表现，却证明我们或轻视普及，或曲解普及，或将普及庸俗化，或把普及和提高分成两橛，“你搞普及，我搞提高”，乃至想到资产阶级的文艺中去找
    “提高”……等等一连串的错误，不断地在发生着。
    “在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，毛主席曾反复告诫：为什么人的问题，是根本问题；而要站稳
    “为什么人”的立场，做好“为什么人”的工作，小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者必须经过思想改造。如果说我们之间谁还没有把“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”读过，还没有把这一段话记得烂熟，那是不可思议的事；然而问题不在于有没有读过，不在于把文件读得烂熟，而在于是否能够遵照文件的指示，艰苦力行。毛主席告诫我们：文艺工作者要真能为工农兵服务，首先要投身于革命的现实斗争中以改造自己的思想情绪，同时也要学习马克思列宁主义和学习社会。又说，这所谓“马列主义，是群众生活群众斗争里完全适用的活的马列主义，不是单单书本上的马列主义。”所以问题的中心在于我们是不是全身心投入于革命的现实斗争。在今天，口头上谁也不会说他不赞成全身心投入于革命的现实斗争，然而实际“投入于革命的现实斗争”的，恐怕未必都是“全身心”。在此一时，对此一事，或者可能是全身心；而在彼一时，对彼一事，就不一定是全身心，而只是半身心。怎样才算是全身心呢？就是完全没有个人的打算，站稳了为人民、为工农兵服务的立场，坚决反对一切不利于人民的事物，不能存有丝毫调和、妥协、同情的态度。如果不能这样，那就只可以说是“半身心”，那就虽然侧身于革命的现实斗争中，而实际上是时时居于旁观者的地位；旁观者的态度是会严重地阻碍了思想意识得到改造的！
    应当承认这样一个事实：小资产阶级出身的知识分子大部分是脑力劳动者，在旧社会中，他们经常受到失业的威胁，生活不大安定，经济不大宽裕，乃至时时处于饥饿的边缘；这样的境遇，决定了小资产阶级出身的知识分子极大部分对于旧社会是不满的，是有着革命的要求的。小资产阶级出身的知识分子中间的一部分——文艺工作者，过去在旧社会中，其生活之不安定，经常有失业的威胁等等，比之从事其他职业的知识分子，有过之而无不及。这一情况，说明了小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者是具有革命性的；而事实上，参加在革命运动中的，就有相当大的一部分小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者。但亦正因为如此，小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者以及其他知识分子，对于“思想改造”这一问题，是在思想上抱着或多或少的抗拒态度的：“我向来就是脑力劳动者，我没有剥削过谁，我向来就有革命的要求，难道我不是劳动人民的一部分么？为什么我还须要经过思想改造呢？”换言之，就是在思想上不自承有非无产阶级的思想意识，因而也就不自觉须要思想改造。然而这样的想法是不对的。因为，“知识分子与无产阶级在经济上是没有什么对抗的。但它的生活状况和劳动条件却是非无产阶级的，因此在心理方面和思想方面也就有相当的对抗。”（列宁）小资产阶级知识分子就是这样，一方面虽然容易接受革命，而另一方面，在思想意识上却是和无产阶级有相当的对抗的。谁要不承认这一事实，那么虽然参加了革命，虽然投身于现实斗争，而在思想改造上，恐怕终于是所获甚少；倘是文艺工作者，则不可能真真为工农兵服务。
    以上所说的两种情况，——不能全身心投入于现实斗争以及思想上不自承有非无产阶级的思想意识，——是小资产阶级出身的文艺工作者共通的毛病，也是我们思想改造过程中极大的绊脚石。近来陆续发见的事实告诉我们：即使生活于工农兵中，投身于现实斗争，为时甚久，而思想终未得到彻底改造，则当环境改变时，受不住资产阶级思想的侵蚀，便会失却立场，铸成大错。我们应当从这样的事实吸取教训，痛切地认识到，思想改造是一个长期的、艰苦的过程，若仅仅下乡数月，进厂半年，就认为改造已经成功，沾沾自满，那是非常危险的。究竟改造得如何，一旦遇到具体问题的考验，这才显出颜色。此在文艺工作者，如果是从事创作的，他的作品就是考验。文艺作家如要检查自己的思想已否得到改造，最好的方法是不断地写作，认真地进行批评和自我批评。写作——批评和自我批评——再深入生活，向工农兵学习，——再写作，——再进行批评和自我批评，——再深入生活……如此反复循环，然后思想改造这一过程能逐渐达到彻底完满的境地。
    有人提出这样一个问题：“我读人家的作品，常能看出一些毛病，能够指出那些不是无产阶级思想意识的地方，可是当我自己动笔写作的时候，我虽然不至于写出衣着是工农兵而思想情绪是小资产阶级的人物来，但拿来和现实生活中现实的人物（战斗英雄，劳动模范等等）一比，就觉得相差太远了，简单一句话，就是作品没有深刻的思想性。这是什么缘故呢？这是不是由于我的思想还没有改造得很好，因而写不出具有高度思想性的作品？”
    这一个问题是带有普遍性的，许多人为此所苦。这在中国的成语叫做“眼高手低”。应当说，一个作家如果眼不高，那是危险的；世上决不会有眼低而手高的作家，（就是说，看不出人家作品中的毛病，而自己作品却没有毛病）反之，眼高却是使得手也能高的前提。问题在于怎样使得手也高起来。那么，“手”究竟是指什么呢？有人以为是指写作的技巧，而且把“眼”和“手”对立起来，说
    “眼”已够高（就是说，思想够高了），现在只要把
    “手”也提高（就是说提高技巧）。这样的说法，我以为未尽然，而且是有害的。为什么是未尽然呢？因为作品之缺乏思想性，或思想性不高，其根本原因还在于作家缺乏高度的思想能力——就是观察和分析都不够尖锐、深刻和全面，而不是技巧的问题；技巧在这里是次要的，部分的。为什么又说这是有害的呢？因为，单纯追求技巧、技巧和思想对立等等不正确的倾向，大部分是由此而产生的。问题的正确的解决，“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中已经给指出来了。这就是学习马克思列宁主义，学习社会。“文艺工作者应该学习文艺创作，这是对的，但是马列主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外。此外还要学习社会，就是要研究社会上的各个阶级，它们的相互关系和个别状况，它们的面貌和它们的心理。”又说：“学习马列主义，不过是要我们用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点去观察世界，观察社会，观察文学艺术，并不是要我们在文学艺术作品中写哲学讲义。马列主义只能包括而不能代替文艺创作中的现实主义，正如它只能包括而不能代替物理科学中的原子论电子论一样。”根据了毛主席的这些指示，我们知道：小资产阶级出身的知识分子的思想改造是第一步，这就是树立了为工农兵服务的立场；没有这个立场，或有之而不坚定，则虽口头上也喊着为工农兵服务，实际做出来的却不是那么一回事；但是，有了这个立场，还不等于就有了马克思列宁主义，还须学习马克思列宁主义。马克思列宁主义是一切革命者都应该学习的科学，文艺工作者不能是例外，而因为文艺工作者描写、表现的对象是社会的活人和事物，所以文艺工作者又不能不学习社会。学习社会就是要研究社会上的各个阶级、它们的相互关系和个别状况，它们的面貌和它们的心理，而要把这些研究做得深刻和全面，就非有辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点不可。
    照这样看来，上文说到的“眼高手低”的问题，
    正是说明了此一特定的作者的思想虽然经过改造，而还不善于用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点去观察社会；问题是在这里，而不在他所提的“是不是由于思想还没有改造得很好。”所谓某人的思想没有改造好，就是说他的思想上还存在着非无产阶级的思想意识，这反映在作品中，就成为有没有原则性错误的问题，根本谈不上思想性高不高的问题。我们说某一作品思想性不高，意即曰，此一作品，原则性的错误是没有的，但是它的观察和分析不够全面和深刻，它所提的问题没有触及社会矛盾的核心，不能分别主要矛盾和次要矛盾，不能一方面表现了矛盾的普遍性，同时又表现了矛盾的特殊性，不能表现矛盾诸方面的同一性和斗争性。一个无产阶级出身的作家，如果不学习马克思列宁主义，不善于运用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点去观察社会，也就不一定能够写出思想性很高的作品。不过，思想改造的问题在小资产阶级知识分子或文艺工作者，既是一个确定立场的问题，那就应当是一个先决的问题；因为“没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的”。
    “在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”针对当时文艺界的思想情况和实际工作中的缺点，就“为什么人”，“如何为法”等等问题，给了明确的指示；在一九三七年七月和八月发表的毛主席的两篇哲学论文“实践论”和“矛盾论”，其中更包含了现实主义创作方法的最基本的问题。从事于文艺工作的我们，固然一定要学习“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，但“实践论”和“矛盾论”也是一定要学习的；如果以为这两篇是哲学论文，而我是搞文艺的，和我无关，那便错了。我们有了若干生活经验，不是常常苦于
    “组织不起来”，苦于不知道如何去“概括”、“提炼”、“剪裁”，因而在写作时，便不免于罗列现象，不免于摄影式的写实，不免于只写了生活的表面现象而缺乏透视，不免于钻进一角而不能鸟瞰全局……等等么？学习“实践论”，可以解决这一系列的问题。“实践论”告诉我们：当我们到生活中去，首先得到的是感性的认识；所谓感性认识，就是个别事物的表面的知识，这种认识是片面的，局部的，不能从事物的现象，深入到事物的本质和其发展的规律；这种感性知识有时还会给我们一种似是而非的错误印象。因此，我们不能满足于感性认识的获得，必须进一步，把感性认识提高到理性认识。所谓理性认识，就是对于事物的全体，本质，及其内部联系的认识，就是对于事物的比较全面，比较深入的认识。提高到理性认识以后，我们对于纷杂错综、时时在变动的社会现象，就能够看出它们的各方面的关联，及其必然的发展规律。所以理性认识和感性认识，“不但是数量上的差别，而且有了性质上的差别。”然而理性认识必须有丰富的感性认识作基础，没有丰富的感性的经验作基础，就不可能抽出能概括事物全体的规律知识。此在文艺写作上，可举人物典型的创造为例。要创造某一阶层人物的典型，必须仔细观察过至少十几个同一阶层的不同生活的人，然后能加以概括，而创造出这一阶层的人物的典型来。在这里，第一步取得的，是丰富的感性知识，第二步然后把这些感性知识提高到理性认识，就是我们所谓“概括”。理性认识获得以后，又必须拿到实践中加以检验和发展，才能获得符合于客观真理的正确认识。此在文艺写作上，便是写作和生活体验的反复进行，循环考核。惟有在写作实践过程中，我们方能真切地考核了我们的认识是否全面和深入，即感性知识是否提高到理性认识；亦惟有在创作实践之后再回到生活中去深深体验，我们方能考核我们的理性认识是否真正符合于客观真理——即社会现实的发展规律。二者必须反复进行的道理，即在于此。如果单纯地认为上一次的生活经验已经写完了，故第二次的到生活中去经验，乃是为了取得新的写作资料，这样的想法是不对的。
    感性认识虽是认识过程的第一步，然而这一步决不可跳过。跳过了这一步，在文艺创作上，便不可避免地会产生空洞、干燥、没有血肉的概念化的作品。反之，抱着一大堆感性知识而停止在那里，在文艺创作上便会落进自然主义的泥坑里。概念化的作品是教条主义的产物，教条主义者的错误在于不承认从感性认识出发的必要，也不承认理性认识有拿到实践中加以考核检验的必要。作品中的自然主义是经验主义的产物，经验主义者的错误在于虽有丰富的生活经验（感性知识），但没有把它们提高到理性认识。除了概念化和自然主义倾向而外，我们文艺界还有一个相当普遍的毛病，就是公式化，如加以详细的说明，这就是在写新和旧的斗争、在写落后和转变的过程时，不善于结合矛盾的普遍性和特殊性，不善于从个别反射到整体（所写的虽然限于个别事物，而目光四射，使读者的认识不局限于此个别事物），也不善于区别并解析主要矛盾和次要矛盾……等等，因而使得人物和故事陷于公式化的窝臼。这样的公式化的作品和概念化或自然主义的作品，有表面的部分的近似，然而在本质上是不同于概念化或自然主义的作品的。（当然，由公式化而进一步定型为公式主义的作品，是和概念化作品没有本质上的区别的，这类作品的作者自己并无生活经验，仅仅套用了别人作品中的新和旧的斗争、落后和转变的过程等等的写法，作为公式，而虚构了人物和故事，硬凑成篇的。）公式化的作品之所以产生，主要是由于作者虽然占有丰富的生活经验，而不善于（不知道如何）把这些感性认识提高到理性认识。“实践论”所指示我们的，就是如何正确地发挥我们的思考作用，如何对于感性知识进行着“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫”，其根本方法，就是要从丰富的感性材料中详细揭发客观事物的各方面的矛盾。学习“矛盾论”，会使得我们掌握了“学习社会”的基本方法。
    首先，我们必须知道：“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性。任何事物都有这种矛盾性，因此引起了事物的运动和发展。事物内部的这种矛盾性是事物发展的根本原因，一事物和他事物的互相联系和互相影响则是事物发展的第二位的原因。”文艺工作者研究的对象，既是形形色色、瞬息万变的社会人生，那就必须明白：“社会的变化，主要地是由于社会内部矛盾的发展，即生产力和生产关系的矛盾，阶级之间的矛盾，新旧之间的矛盾，由于这些矛盾的发展，推动了社会的前进，推动了新旧社会之代谢。”因此，表现矛盾，并解决矛盾，是一篇文艺作品必不可少的基本任务。没有表现矛盾的作品是不现实的，因为现实生活中是充满了矛盾的。
    但是有矛盾的普遍性，也有矛盾的特殊性。如果看到了矛盾的普遍性而不看到矛盾的特殊性，也就是说，如果只是笼统地观察了全局的东西（比方说，进一个工厂，只在总经理部或工会执委会和领导干部接触），而没有深入局部（比方说，深入车间、小组和个别工人接触），没有揭露那具有决定意义的局部的东西，那就会使得作品所表现的，只是矛盾的普遍性。然而，“各种物质运动形式中的矛盾，都带特殊性”，作品而仅表现了矛盾的普遍性，便不可免地使得它所表现的生活陷于片面性的错误。“不了解矛盾各方的特点”，例如，只了解无产阶级一方，不了解资产阶级一方，只了解农民
    一方，不了解地主一方，……等等，这就叫做片面地看问题。或者，“对矛盾总体和矛盾各方的特点都不去看，否认深入事物里面精细地研究矛盾特点的必要，仅仅站在那里远远地望一望，粗枝大叶地看到一点矛盾的形相，就想动手去解决矛盾”，这叫做表面地看问题。在文艺创作中所有各式各样各种不同程度的概念化、公式化的毛病，都和作者的片面地或表面地看问题有关系。矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的关系，毛主席曾概括如下：“矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的关系，就是矛盾的共性和个性的关系。其共性是矛盾存在于一切过程中，并贯串于一切过程的始终……所以它是共性，是绝对性。然而这种共性，即包含于一切个性之中，无个性即无共性。……因为矛盾的各各特殊，所以造成了个性。一切个性都是有条件地暂时地存在的，所以是相对的。”这一段话，对于文艺工作者极端重要。一篇作品如果能够表现出矛盾的共性和个性，那就是富有高度思想性的作品。
    此外，多数矛盾并在的场合，其中有主要的矛盾和次要的矛盾。什么叫做主要的矛盾？“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，……就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。”但“矛盾的主要和非主要的方面互相转化着，事物的性质也就随着起变化。”作品的公式化之所以产生，也就在于没有分析多数矛盾的主要和次要的，从而也没有表现出矛盾的主要和非主要方面的互相转化。
    如上所述，“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”指示我们：必须首先解决“为什么人”的问题，其次是
    “如何为法”的问题，要真能解决这些问题，我们非进行思想改造不可，而我们的工作方向就只有一个工农兵的方向。而“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”所没有详尽发挥的属于现实主义创作方法的基本原则的“学习社会”的问题，在“实践论”和
    “矛盾论”中便有了最详尽最精辟的指示。这三个文件便是我们的马克思列宁主义的文艺理论的经典。我们有了这样的精深博大的指导理论，我们又有政府的帮助，给我们以改造思想、体验生活的各种便利条件，而又处在这样一个轰轰烈烈、光辉多彩的伟大时代，我们的条件实在是再好也没有了，如果我们还不能做出和这伟大时代相称的工作，那不能怪别人，只好怪自己。
    让我们当此“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年纪念的时候，下决心做好两件事罢：一、深入群众的斗争生活，认真改造思想；二、虚心刻苦地学习社会，坚决执行工农兵方向！
