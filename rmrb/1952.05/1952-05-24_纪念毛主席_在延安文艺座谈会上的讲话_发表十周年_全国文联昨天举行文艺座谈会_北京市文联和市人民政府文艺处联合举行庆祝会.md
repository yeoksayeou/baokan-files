Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a symposium on May 23rd to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Those present included Guo Moruo, Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Feng Xuefeng, Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian, Cao Yu, Zhao Shuli, Lü Ji, Zhou Libo, Shi Dongshan, Jiang Feng, Chen Yi, Cao Jinghua, Li Bozhao, and more than fifty others.

The symposium discussed how to strengthen the ideological remolding of literary and art workers, criticize and eliminate the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie; overcome the tendency of formulaic and conceptualized literary and artistic creation, and strengthen the ideological and artistic qualities of works; and issues concerning the nationalization and popularization of literature and art. Guo Moruo, Zhou Yang, Hong Shen, Ding Ling, Chen Yi, Feng Xuefeng, Zhao Shuli, Li Bozhao, Mei Lanfang, and others spoke at the meeting. Speakers unanimously agreed that in order to remold their thinking, literary and art workers must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and practically participate in the struggle of the masses. Literary and art institutions and organizations should have practical methods to regularly organize literary and art workers to go deep into the masses and deep into life, and not just talk about it. Regarding the issue of formulaic and conceptualized literary and artistic creation, speakers believed that this was also the result of literary and art workers being divorced from the masses and divorced from life. To overcome this tendency, the main thing is for literary and art workers to go deep into the lives of the masses and become familiar with the lives of the masses, while also strengthening the work of literary and art criticism. Regarding the issue of nationalization and popularization, speakers believed that on this issue, the first thing is to understand that our nation is a constantly rising nation, and our masses are a constantly advancing mass. Therefore, accepting national heritage is to improve it and develop it, so that it is suitable for expressing today's new reality and new life.

In addition, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers and the Beijing Municipal People's Government Literary and Art Department also jointly held a celebration on the 23rd. Liao Mosha, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, gave a report to more than 200 literary and art workers present on studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

On the evening of the 23rd, the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles both held literary and artistic evening performances. At the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles' evening performance, many excellent literary and artistic programs since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art were performed. At the evening performance held by the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, amateur literary and art groups from factories and rural areas participated in the performance.

    纪念毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表十周年
    全国文联昨天举行文艺座谈会
    北京市文联和市人民政府文艺处联合举行庆祝会
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国文学艺术界联合会为纪念毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表十周年，在二十三日举行了文艺座谈会。到会的有郭沫若、周扬、丁玲、冯雪峰、梅兰芳、欧阳予倩、曹禺、赵树理、吕骥、周立波、史东山、江丰、陈沂、曹靖华、李伯钊等五十余人。
    座谈会讨论了如何加强文艺工作者的思想改造，批判和清除资产阶级的思想影响；克服文艺创作上的公式化、概念化的倾向，加强作品的思想性和艺术性；关于文学艺术的民族化和大众化等问题。在会上发言的有郭沫若、周扬、洪深、丁玲、陈沂、冯雪峰、赵树理、李伯钊、梅兰芳等人。发言者一致认为文艺工作者要改造思想，必须遵照毛主席的指示，到工农兵群众中去，实际参加群众的斗争。文艺机关和文艺团体应有切实的办法经常组织文艺工作者深入群众、深入生活，而不只是说说而已。关于文艺创作上的公式化概念化的问题，发言者都认为这也是文艺工作者脱离群众脱离生活的结果，要克服这种倾向，主要在文艺工作者的深入群众生活、熟悉群众生活，同时要加强文艺批评的工作。关于民族化和大众化的问题，发言者认为在这一问题上首先要理解我们的民族是不断上升的民族，我们的大众是不断前进的大众。因此接受民族遗产是为了提高它和发展它，使它适合于表现今天新的现实、新的生活。
    此外北京市文学艺术工作者联合会和北京市人民政府文艺处也联合在二十三日举行了庆祝会，北京市人民政府文化教育委员会副主任廖沫沙向到会的文艺工作者二百余人作了关于学习毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的报告。
    二十三日晚，全国文联和北京市文联都举行了文艺晚会。在全国文联的晚会上，演出了自延安文艺座谈会以来的许多优秀文艺节目。在北京市文联举行的晚会上，有工厂和农村的业余文艺团体参加表演。
