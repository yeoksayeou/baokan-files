Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd: Our special correspondent reports: Admiral Joye's final contribution to the Panmunjom armistice talks over the past ten months is to turn the negotiations into a great lesson illustrating American hypocrisy and deception, a record that cannot be erased for many years to come. Washington's final task for him was to continue spreading the bankrupt lie that "ten thousand prisoners of war would rather die than return home," or else break off the negotiations.

In order to carry out Washington's orders, he created unforgettable miracles, wagging his hypocritical tongue every day, talking about "respecting the rights and well-being of prisoners of war," while at the same time, Chinese and Korean prisoners of war were fighting against American tanks, bullets, and suppression, showing that they would rather die than live as vagrants abroad, living a slow death in the hands of the enemy. It is expected that unless Washington changes its attitude, the two-star General Harrison, who is succeeding Joye today, may still write the darkest chapter in the history of the armistice negotiations. If Washington does not change its attitude, he will sink deeper and deeper into the mess left by Joye.

Joye's last words warned that the task he was handing over was "not enviable." Harrison probably heard this very clearly. The position he had to take over was a ridiculous one created by blatant denial of the facts. In his last days in the conference tent, Joye was met with sharp questions from General Nan Ri, and had no choice but to remain silent. Forced screening, slaughtering and wounding prisoners of war, forced writing of blood letters, using tanks and armed forces to isolate them regardless of their wishes to return home - is all this respecting human rights? No answer.

General Nan Ri had to say to Joye: This is the undeniable fact that "your side dares not directly answer and cannot answer." Joye had nowhere to escape. He was forced to reply weakly: "Our side formally declares that it will ignore your questions." Later, he had to say again and again: "We will continue to refuse to answer." For several days, Joye suggested "adjourning the meeting to the usual time" to evade a series of facts. On the last day, this American admiral, without waiting for General Nan Ri's reply, stormed out of the tent with a furious look and said to Harrison:

"God bless you."

However, the facts that occurred outside the conference tent are all there, and they have completely refuted the lie of "respecting human rights" by American generals. The American army and marine generals cannot deny this. On May 17th, an American paratrooper regiment was sent to Geoje Island to suppress prisoners of war. On the same day, a Chinese prisoner of war was shot and killed by an American guard on Geoje Island. According to Bonner, the commander of the American prisoner-of-war camp, 400 female prisoners of war held a demonstration that day demanding the repatriation of all prisoners in the prisoner-of-war camp hospital. Bonner did not explain the reason, but from the demands of the prisoners themselves revealed by the U.S., it is clear that due to fear of executioners isolating them for forced screening, and fear of executioners moving them to death camps or secret camps where they would be tortured and forced to submit where public opinion could not see them, they demanded repatriation at all costs. The Americans also sent flame-throwing tanks and combat troops to the prisoner-of-war camps. These American combat troops have used bayonets against prisoners of war.

However, the blood of eighty-six prisoners of war has already been shed on the mainland of Busan, and American news agencies previously said that all the prisoners of war living in Busan were "preferring to die rather than return home." One prisoner of war was killed by a "grenade." The Associated Press said: "Prisoners of war on the mainland are all considered anti-communists." It was these prisoners of war, considered to be against repatriation, who bravely fought the American infantry armed with bayonets and grenades who wanted to move them out for "isolation."

The leaders of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation pointed out that Joye, Clark, and Truman are the most active masterminds of these incidents. Their attitude of insisting on violence and bloodshed, insisting on isolation and forced screening of prisoners of war in order to exile and enslave them, is creating, and will continue to create, these incidents every day.

The leaders also said: "The only way to prevent these incidents is to stop forced screening and let all prisoners of war go home." He warned that if the current policy of the U.S. continues unchanged, it will only completely expose American hypocrisy and will only cause the American government representatives to suffer an unprecedented defeat at the conference table watched by the world. "If they insist on the inhumane policy of not allowing prisoners of war to return home to reunite with their families, they are bound to suffer a complete failure."

### 我方谈判代表团负责人发表谈话  美方如不改变无理态度必将遭到惨败

    我方谈判代表团负责人发表谈话
    美方如不改变无理态度必将遭到惨败
    【新华社开城二十二日电】本社特派记者报道：乔埃海军中将对板门店十多个月的停战谈判的最后贡献，是把谈判变成一个说明美国的伪善与骗术的极大教训，这种记录是以后多少年也抹不掉的。华盛顿给他的最后的任务是要他继续撒“十万战俘宁死不回国”这个已经破了产的谎言，不然就中断谈判。
    为了执行华盛顿的命令，他创造了叫人忘不掉的奇迹，天天鼓动他那伪善的舌头，说什么“尊重战俘的权利与幸福”，而同时朝中战俘却在与美国坦克、子弹和镇压作斗争，表明他们宁死也不愿流浪在外，在敌人手里过慢性死亡的生活。人们预料，除非华盛顿改变态度，不然今天接替乔埃的二星将军哈利逊可能还是会写下停战谈判史上最黑暗的一章。如果华盛顿不改变态度，他还会在乔埃所留下的一团糟的局面里愈陷愈深。
    乔埃的最后一句话警告说：他所移交的任务是“值不得羡慕的”。这句话哈利逊大概听的很清楚。他所不得不接替的地位是一个因公然抵赖事实而造成的为人耻笑的地位。乔埃在会议帐篷里的最后几天，碰到了南日将军提出的尖锐的问题，不得已只好默不作声。强迫甄别、屠杀和打伤战俘、强迫写血书、不顾战俘回国的愿望而用坦克与武装部队把他们隔离开来，所有这一切难道是尊重人权吗？没有回答。
    南日将军不得不向乔埃说：这就是“你方不敢直接回答也不能回答”的不可动摇的事实。乔埃无处可逃了，他被迫无力地回答说：“我方正式声明不理睬你方的问题”。后来他就只好一而再、再而三地说：“我们将继续拒绝回答”。好些天来，乔埃都是建议“休会到通常时间”来规避一连串的事实。最后一天，这位美国海军将领不听完南日将军的答复，就满面怒容地蹓出帐篷，向哈利逊说：
    “愿上帝保佑你”。
    但是在会议帐篷外发生的事实一一俱在，它们已经把美国将军们所谓的“尊重人权”的谎言驳得体无完肤，美国海陆军将军们是狡赖不了的。五月十七日，一个美国伞兵团被派到巨济岛去镇压战俘。同日，一名中国战俘在巨济岛被一名美国卫兵枪杀。据美国俘虏营长官波纳透露，那一天还有四百名妇女战俘举行示威，要求遣返战俘营医院中的所有俘虏。波纳并未说明原因，但从美方自己透露的战俘们的要求中可以明显地看出，由于害怕刽子手把他们隔离起来强迫甄别，由于害怕刽子手把他们迁到死亡营或秘密营中，在舆论看不到的地方对他们施行酷刑，逼迫他们屈服，他们已不顾一切地要求遣返。美国人还派了喷射火焰的坦克和战斗部队到俘虏营去。这些美国战斗部队已使用刺刀对付战俘。
    但是，已经有八十六名战俘的鲜血洒在大陆上的釜山，而美国通讯社先前还说，住在釜山的都是“宁死也不愿回家”的战俘。有一名战俘是被“手榴弹”打死的。美联社说：“大陆上的战俘都被认为是反共分子”。对刺刀和手榴弹武装起来、要把他们迁出去加以“隔离”的美国步兵进行了英勇斗争的，就是这些被认为反对遣返的战俘。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军谈判代表团的负责人指出，乔埃、克拉克和杜鲁门都是这种事件的最积极的主谋人。他们那种坚持暴力和流血、坚持隔离和强迫甄别战俘以便把他们加以流放和奴役的态度，每天都在制造，并且会继续制造这种事件。
    负责人又说：“防止这种事件的唯一办法就是停止强迫甄别，让全部战俘回家。”他提出警告说：美方目前的政策，如果长此以往不加改变，就只能彻底暴露美国的伪善，就只能使美国政府代表在全世界众目所瞩的会议桌上遭到空前的惨败。“如果他们坚持不让战俘回家与亲人团聚的非人道政策，他们必然要遭受彻底的失败。”
