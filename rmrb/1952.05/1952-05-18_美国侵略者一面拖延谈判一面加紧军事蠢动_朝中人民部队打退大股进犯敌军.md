Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th: While the American aggressors stubbornly and unreasonably insist on the absurd proposition of detaining a large number of our captured personnel at the armistice talks, they have also intensified their military sabotage. On the western front, the American aggressor army launched its largest offensive in more than three months on the ninth of this month. At 4:20 AM that day, five companies of the 1st Marine Division of the American aggressor army, under the cover of four aircraft and more than twenty tanks, attacked one of our army's positions and its outposts west of Korangpo. After an hour and twenty minutes of frantic attacks, the enemy army occupied our army's voluntarily evacuated outpost at the cost of heavy casualties and ammunition consumption. However, our army's artillery immediately bombarded the enemy fiercely, and our brave soldiers, under the cover of artillery fire, counterattacked the enemy who had not yet gained a firm foothold, and quickly recovered the outpost. Afterwards, although the enemy repeatedly pounced on our outpost, they were repelled by our army each time. In this battle, our army killed or wounded more than 250 enemy soldiers, and destroyed or damaged one enemy tank each. On the 10th, an enemy company ambushed our Haicun Xishan position west of Korangpo North. When they sneaked to the side and rear of our position, they were suddenly attacked by our defending forces. Then our soldiers launched a counter-offensive against the enemy, completely crushing them, killing or wounding 26 enemy soldiers. On the same day, two enemy companies attacked our outpost south of the 890.2 Height east of the North Han River, and were killed or wounded more than 40 before retreating.
In recent days, in addition to repelling enemy incursions, our army has continued to use flexible tactics such as ambushes, raids, counterattacks, and sniping to kill and wound the enemy. On the night of the 6th, a unit of our army on the eastern front counterattacked the enemy on an unnamed height east of the North Han River and a hilltop to the east, annihilating the entire 10th Company of the 22nd Regiment of the 53rd Division of the Li puppet army entrenched there, and killing or wounding more than 150 enemy soldiers from other units. Our artillery units killed or wounded more than 160 enemy soldiers in one day on the 6th, and destroyed three enemy tanks in the areas west of Tieyuan and west of Korangpo.

    朝中人民部队打退大股进犯敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】美国侵略者一面在停战谈判会议上蛮横无理地坚持扣留大批我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，一面又加紧了在军事上的蠢动。在西部前线，美国侵略军在本月九日发动了三个多月以来规模最大的一次进犯。这天四时二十分，美国侵略军海军陆战队第一师的五个连，在四架飞机、二十多辆战车的掩护下进犯高浪浦里以西我军的一个阵地及其前哨阵地。经过一小时二十分的疯狂进攻，敌军以大量伤亡和弹药消耗的代价才侵占了我军主动撤出的前哨阵地。但我军大炮随即向敌军猛烈轰击，我军勇士在炮火掩护下勇猛反击立足未稳的敌人，迅速收复了该前哨阵地。此后敌人虽然再三向我前哨阵地猛扑，但每次都被我军击溃。这次战斗我军共毙伤敌军二百五十多名，击毁击伤敌军战车各一辆。十日敌军一个连偷袭高浪浦里北我海村西山阵地。当他们窜至我阵地侧后时突然遭到我守军痛击，接着我军战士们向敌人发起反冲锋，将敌全部击溃，毙伤敌军二十六名。同日，敌军两个连向北汉江以东八九零·二高地南侧我前哨阵地进犯，被杀伤四十多名后溃退。
    连日来，我军除打退敌军的进犯外，继续以伏击，袭击，反击，狙击等灵活的战术手段杀伤敌人。六日夜间，东线我军某部向北汉江以东一个无名高地及其以东一个山头上的敌军反击，一举将盘踞该地的李伪军第五十三师第二十二团第十连全部歼灭，并杀伤另部敌军一百五十多名。我炮兵部队在六日的一天中，杀伤敌军一百六十多名，并在铁原以西和高浪浦里以西两地击毁敌军战车三辆。
