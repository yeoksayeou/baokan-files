Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: The full text of the confession of U.S. prisoner of war, Enak:

The Truth About How U.S. Imperialism Launched Bacteriological Warfare

Note: This material was confessed by American prisoner of war, Kenneth Lloyd Enak, during interrogation. The prisoner's military rank was Air Force Lieutenant. From August 13 to September 1, 1951, his 3rd Bombardment Wing was stationed at Iwakuni Air Base in Japan. On September 1, 1951, he moved with the Wing to Gunsan Air Base in Korea, where he served as a night navigator on a B-26 bomber. He flew 32 sorties and bombing missions in Korea. On January 6 and 10, 1952, he dropped six germ bombs on the cities of Hwangju and Junghwa in North Korea, two on Hwangju and four on Junghwa. On January 13, he was shot down northwest of Pyongyang.

The following is the full text of Enak's confession on April 7, 1952:

In the last two weeks of August 1951, I was in Iwakuni, Japan. It was in August that the 3rd Bombardment Wing was moving to Gunsan, Korea. The last to move was the Ground School, which moved to Gunsan in early September (according to the prisoner's confession: the Ground School's mission was to train courses such as flight mapping). While I was in Iwakuni, about fifteen new air combat teams transferred from the United States attended the Ground School (according to the prisoner's confession: each team had four people, totaling sixty). The Ground School's curriculum was no different from that of the 4400th Combat Crew Training Group School. We navigators studied navigation, B-26, and Korean courses and problems, to better understand our work and better prepare for combat flights.

At 1:00 PM on August 25, 1951, we attended a secret class in the Ground School's navigator classroom. As I recall, ten pilots and fifteen navigators were present. Among the pilots, I remember Warrant Officer Broughton, Warrant Officer Schmidt, and Captain Laimack. Among the navigators, I remember Warrant Officer Blanc, Warrant Officer Hardy, Warrant Officer Dagoo, Warrant Officer Gillinsky, Warrant Officer Gerwin, Warrant Officer Larson, and myself. I did not recognize the other pilots and navigators except for those who had worked with me at Langley Air Force Base. The instructor was a civilian named Mr. Wilson. No other instructors participated.

Mr. Wilson told us that his course was about bacteriological warfare. He told us that although we had no plans to use bacteriological warfare at the time, we might have to use it at some point, so this course was classified as secret intelligence and we were not to disclose its contents to anyone, not even among ourselves (the attendees).

The main part of Mr. Wilson's course was devoted to explaining the weapons used in bacteriological warfare. He did not bring any specimens himself, but he talked about various ways of spreading bacteria; either spreading the bacteria themselves; or dropping insects and animals to spread the bacteria.

Mr. Wilson's instruction included the following:

Methods of spreading the bacteria themselves:

	1. Dropping bombs filled with a mixture of dust and bacteria, which would open in mid-air and spread the bacteria-laden dust by wind.
	2. Using a sprayer device to directly spread dust from the aircraft, so that the air in the area of dispersion would contain bacteria.
	3. Dropping containers or bombs filled with bacterial dust, which would open in water. They could also use cardboard boxes that would open when soaked in water and drop them into reservoirs or lakes, where the water would be used by people and animals, and where insects would become infected and spread the bacteria.

Methods of dropping insects:

	1. Dropping germ bombs that look like ordinary bombs, but filled with bacteria-carrying insects, which would open upon impact and release the insects.
	2. Dropping cardboard containers filled with insects, which would crack upon impact and allow the insects to escape with the bacteria.
	3. Using animals to spread insects.

Methods of using animals to spread bacteria:

	1. Dropping rats, rabbits, or other small wild animals in containers with parachutes, which would release the animals upon impact, covered with bacteria-laden lice and fleas.
	2. Using ships to release these animals onto the land from the enemy's rear coast.

There are also other methods of spreading bacteria:

	1. Dropping leaflets, toilet paper, envelopes, and other paper items with bacteria.
	2. Dropping soap or clothing mixed with bacteria.
	3. Dropping fountain pens filled with bacteria-laden ink.
	4. Giving contaminated food to enemy troops.

Bacteria can also be released from artillery shells or mortar shells, but this is unsafe because it is too close to the front line.

There are many types of bacteria that can be spread. In addition to many strange and rarely heard-of bacteria, bacteria from several well-known diseases can be used, such as: typhus (note), typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, plague, smallpox (note), malaria (note), and yellow fever (note). The insects used to carry the bacteria also come in all shapes and sizes, the most common being lice, fleas, flies, and mosquitoes. Lice, fleas, and flies can carry typhus, cholera, smallpox, plague, and dysentery germs, while mosquitoes can carry malaria and yellow fever germs.

(Note) The following notes were added by Dr. Zhong Huilan, a medical doctor. Dr. Zhong was previously a member of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in London and a researcher at the Hamburg Tropical Disease School in Germany. He is now a professor of internal medicine and a leading expert in tropical and infectious diseases in China. – The Interrogator

"The pathogen of typhus is Rickettsia, malaria is caused by Plasmodium, and smallpox and yellow fever are caused by two different filterable viruses. The American prisoner is a non-medical worker, so he inevitably mixed up these pathogens with infectious bacteria. He also made a mistake in the use of DDT."

Preparation is the best way to prevent germ bombs. All possible personnel should be vaccinated against all possible diseases. If insects are dropped, it is best to pour kerosene or other oil on the containers of bacterial insects and burn them. If the insects have escaped from the containers, it is best to spray DDT in the area, preferably by aircraft. If bacteria-laden dust is used, DDT should also be sprayed. All exposed food must be disposed of, all exposed clothing and items must be washed with hot water and medicinal soap; water must be boiled; food must be thoroughly cooked; the mouth and nose must be protected with a mask when breathing; after all these things are done, clothing must be changed and a bath taken; all waste and garbage that easily harbor bacteria should be burned. In summer, all windows should have screens to prevent insects. In any case, small animals such as rats, which carry fleas, should be eliminated to reduce the risk of plague. If paper products or similar items are dropped, they should be burned immediately.

When using bacteriological weapons, the lower and slower the aircraft flies, the better, to avoid harming the bacteria being spread. If weapons with parachutes are used, any altitude is suitable, but it should not be too high, 1,000 feet is appropriate, so that the parachute does not drift away from the target area.

Mr. Wilson finished this class at 3:00 PM. He reminded us again not to talk about bacteriological weapons with anyone, and then left the classroom. We only took this course once. I went to Gunsan on September 1, 1951.

In October and December 1951, I attended two (one hour each) courses on bacteriological warfare defense in Gunsan. The instructor was Major Browning. This course was held regularly, and everyone was required to attend for one hour. The content of the courses in October and December was the same. This course was held regularly because of the rotation plan, with new units constantly arriving; and it was also beneficial for everyone to remember the content of his course. Major Browning told us that it was not unreasonable to assume that the enemy would use bacteriological warfare against us. If they did, they would use bacterial dust or bacteria-carrying insects. He emphasized that we should get vaccinated regularly and promptly (according to the prisoner's confession, every six weeks). He also talked about some other information that I mentioned in the second paragraph of the third page of this material. (Note: This refers to the seventh paragraph of the full text – translator's note.)

On January 1, 1952, the training officer of the battalion operations office told us in our routine instructions that after each mission, we must report all "unexploded bombs" we dropped (according to the prisoner's confession: the so-called "unexploded bombs" meant germ bombs. The use of "unexploded bombs" instead of germ bombs was intended to maintain secrecy) and report where these "unexploded bombs" landed. This was a normal operating procedure and seemed like a casual reminder at the time. This "reminder" was given by Captain Galley, the battalion training officer, to all personnel before setting off on bombing missions. That night, I did not fly due to a headache. Another navigator took my place.

My second pre-arranged flight mission was on January 6, 1952. We were scheduled to fly along Green Route 8 (between Pyongyang and Sariwon), departing at 3:00 AM at night. The personnel performing the mission were Captain Ames, the pilot, myself, the navigator, and Sergeant Cushi, the machine gunner. As usual, Captain Ames and I reported to the battalion training room and the battalion operations office at 2:00 AM, one hour before departure. We usually checked the weather and obtained information for the flight mission here. On this night, an officer on duty, whom I did not recognize, gave us instructions, saying that we would fly to Hwangju and drop two bombs mounted on the wings, and then drop the other bombs we were carrying as quickly as possible and fly directly back to Gunsan. He also said that when bombing Hwangju, the flight altitude should be 500 feet, and the maximum flight speed should be 200 miles per hour. We brought to his attention whether such a flight altitude was appropriate, as we were instructed to carry ten 500-pound bombs. But he told us that this was extremely secret because these were germ bombs; and that this mission was not to be told to anyone else. He told us that the wing bombs were already installed and had been checked for us, so we should not worry about them. Upon returning to the base, just report the bombs mounted on the wings as "unexploded bombs." Then we went to the squadron operations section to find our machine gunner. As far as I know, he did not report to the battalion and did not know that this was a special mission. When we went out to get on the plane, we saw a sentry from the ordnance department there, who told us that the wing bombs had been checked. This we already knew. We ourselves checked the six bombs in the bomb bay. These were six ordinary 500-pound bombs. At 3:00 AM, we took off and flew to Hwangju, dropping the two germ bombs on the western edge of the city. There was no explosion and nothing special was seen. Then we continued to fly north for two minutes, dropping our eight explosive bombs on the highway five miles north of Hwangju, and then flew directly back to Gunsan. We took off at 3:00 AM, dropped the bombs at 4:00 AM, and landed in Gunsan at 5:00 AM. This was the first time I had heard of dropping germ bombs, and we kept it a secret. To me, these germ bombs looked exactly like ordinary 500-pound bombs. In the daytime, some distinctive features might be seen, but I saw the germ bombs at night. I myself had never installed these bombs, nor had I seen anyone else install them. There was no special equipment on the wings. Therefore, loading germ bombs was the same as loading ordinary bombs.

When we reported the execution of this mission to the battalion intelligence office, we reported that we had dropped two 500-pound bombs in Hwangju (in fact, the germ bombs only weighed 150 pounds), and called them "unexploded bombs" in the report, and also reported where we had dropped our eight good bombs. The reason why these two bombs were called "unexploded bombs" in the report was obviously to prevent more people from knowing the purpose of our mission. But higher headquarters could check these reports and know where the germs were spread.

On January 10, whether by chance or planned, the same mission was assigned to Ames, Cushi, and me again. This time, Ames and I reported to the battalion operations office first. They told us that all four bombs mounted on the wings were germ bombs. This time the target was Junghwa on Green Route 8. After the germ bombs were dropped, the remaining bombs should be dropped as quickly as possible, and then return to base immediately. We still had to keep this mission a secret, and call the germ bombs "unexploded bombs" in the report. Our maximum speed when dropping the germ bombs was 200 miles per hour. Our flight altitude was 500 feet. The ordnance department still checked the bombs on the wings for us. We called Cushi from the squadron operations section and went to the plane. The bombs on the wings were still the same as ordinary bombs. An ordnance officer told us that we did not have to worry about the bombs on the wings because everything was ready. I checked the other bombs in the bomb bay. We took off at 3:00 AM and went straight to Junghwa. At 4:10 AM, at an altitude of 500 feet and a speed of 190 miles per hour, we dropped our germ bombs on the western edge of Junghwa. After that, we continued to fly south and dropped the other ordinary bombs on the highway north of Hwangju. Then we turned back to Gunsan Air Base. We landed at 5:15 AM.

When we came back to report the execution of the mission, we reported where we had dropped six good bombs. And we reported that there were four "unexploded bombs" in Junghwa, for the same reasons as above, to maintain secrecy.

The above picture is the type of germ bomb we used. I believe that the germ bombs came from a medical supply depot that manufactures vaccines. I believe this supply depot is in Japan: either on Honshu or Kyushu.

If this type of germ bomb that we dropped is used, it will open upon impact and scatter bacteria and insects into the open space. If the outside weather is cold, the insects will hibernate or move slowly, but the sun will activate them with its heat.

Leaflets were dropped by B-29 bombers in North Korea. These leaflets were dropped in boxes, which would open in the air and scatter the leaflets over a large area. These leaflets can be used in bacteriological warfare.

When dropping germ bombs, the pilot is responsible for dropping them; the navigator is responsible for recording the time, location, and number of germ bombs dropped. Dropping germ bombs is controlled by a button.

After the mission is completed, when the flight personnel report the execution of the mission to the battalion intelligence office, all personnel on the entire aircraft participate in this report, but only the pilot and navigator speak. This is an informal report, with all personnel on the aircraft sitting around a table, reporting to a soldier sent by the intelligence office. He listens to the report and records the content on paper. This record is to be submitted to his superior. This is why germ bombs are called "unexploded bombs" in the report, to prevent the unapproved intelligence personnel and flight personnel from knowing the secret of this mission.

As far as I know, the B-26 aircraft is the only one used to drop ordinary germ bombs, which look like ordinary bombs. After all, the B-26 is not suitable for dropping other types of weapons. Leaflets are dropped by B-29 aircraft and C-46 and C-47 transport aircraft, but mainly by B-29s. Transport aircraft are best suited for dropping all other types of bacteriological weapons. Such as cardboard boxes, containers with parachutes, and clothes, food, soap, paper, and fountain pens. B-29s can also drop these weapons.

As for when we started using germ bombs, it was around the beginning of the year, that is, around January 1, 1952, because this was the day we all received the notice about "unexploded bombs." It is likely that other units, such as the 452nd Bombardment Wing, also began bacteriological warfare at the same time.

Of course, the decision to use germ bombs was extremely secret. But due to the seriousness of this decision, it was undoubtedly decided by a very high-level headquarters, possibly the Tokyo Far East Command.

    美国帝国主义如何发动细菌战争的真相
    【新华社五日讯】美国战俘伊纳克供词全文如下：
    美国帝国主义如何发动细菌战争的真相
    按：这一材料是美籍俘虏凯尼斯·罗埃德·伊纳克在审询过程中坦白出来的。该俘虏军阶是空军中尉。一九五一年八月十三日至九月一日，他所属的第三轰炸联队驻扎在日本岩国基地。一九五一年九月一日他随该联队迁驻朝鲜群山基地，担任B—26型轰炸机夜间领航员的任务。他在朝鲜曾执行过三十二次飞行及轰炸任务。于一九五二年一月六日及十日曾先后两次在北朝鲜黄州及中和两城投掷细菌弹六枚。在黄州投两枚；中和投四枚。旋于一月十三日在平壤西北被我击落。
    下面是伊纳克在一九五二年四月七日的供词全文：
    一九五一年八月的最后两周，我在日本岩国。就是在八月间，第三轰炸联队正往朝鲜群山迁移，最后迁移的是地面学校，它于九月初迁往群山（按俘虏口供：地面学校的任务是训练飞行地图等课程）。我在岩国的时候，大约有十五个新自美国调来的航空战斗小组参加地面学校的学习（按俘虏口供：每一小组有四人，共六十人）。该地面学校课程内容和4400战斗人员训练大队学校的课目并无两样，我们领航员所学的是领航，B—26及朝鲜的课程和问题，目的在于使我们更好地了解自己的工作，更好地准备作战中的飞行。
    一九五一年八月二十五日下午一时，我们在地面学校领航班教室中参加了一堂秘密课。照我所记得的，共有十名驾驶员和十五名领航员出席听讲。在驾驶员中，我记得有白劳顿尉官，斯密特尉官和莱麦克上尉。在领航员中，我记得有白朗尉官，哈地尉官，戴古尉官，吉林斯基尉官，格尔文尉官，拉逊尉官和我自己。除开曾经和我一道在兰利机场工作过的之外，其他的驾驶员和领航员我都不认识。教课人员是一个非军事人员（普通平民）名叫威尔逊先生。除他之外，并无其他教官参加。
    威尔逊先生告诉我们，他的课程是有关细菌战争的。他对我们说：虽然我方在当时并无计划使用细菌战，但是我们可能有个时候要使用，因此这一课程是属于秘密情报，我们不能对任何人泄露这一课程的内容，即使在我们（听课者）当中，也不许谈论。
    威尔逊先生的课程的主要部分是专门讲解细菌战所用的武器。他本人并未带有标本，但他谈论到各种各样的撒布细菌的方法；或者撒布细菌本身；或者投掷昆虫及动物来传播细菌。
    威尔逊先生的授课内容如下：
    撒布细菌本身的方法是：
    1、投掷装满了混有尘埃与细菌的炸弹，这种炸弹将在半空中即打开来，并借风力散播带有细菌的尘埃。
    2、利用喷雾器装置，由飞机直接散布尘埃，因此在散布尘埃的地方，空气中即有细菌。
    3、或者投掷装满细菌尘埃的容器或炸弹，这一类容器会在水中开启，也可以用会被水渗湿后启开的硬纸盒，把它投到贮水池或湖沼中，这些地方的水是人和动物都要饮用的，并且这些地方的昆虫会染上细菌并传播它们。
    投掷昆虫的方法是：
    1、投掷外形和普通炸弹一样的细菌弹，但这种炸弹中，装满了带有细菌的昆虫，这种炸弹触地后即开启并放散出这些昆虫来。
    2、投掷盛有昆虫的硬纸制容器，这种容器触地后即行裂开，昆虫就会带着细菌逸散出来。
    3、或以动物散播昆虫。
    以动物散播细菌的方法是：
    1、以装有降落伞的容器投放老鼠、兔子或其他小野物，这种容器触地后即放出这类动物，这些动物遍身沾满带有细菌的虱子和跳蚤。
    2、或用船只把这类动物从敌人后方海岸放到陆上。
    亦有其他撒布细菌方法：
    1、投掷带有细菌的传单，大便纸，信封及其他纸制物品。
    2、投掷混有细菌之肥皂或衣服。
    3、投掷装有细菌的墨水的自来水笔。
    4、或给敌军部队投掷沾染细菌之食物。
    也可以从榴弹炮或迫击炮的炮弹中放射细菌，但因距前线太近，这一做法不安全。
    可以撒布的细菌的类型很多。除开很多奇怪的和不常听到的细菌外，有几种比较出名的疾病的细菌，如：斑疹伤寒（注）、伤寒、霍乱、痢疾、鼠疫、天花（注）、疟疾（注）以及黄热病（注），都可使用。同时用以粘附细菌的昆虫也是各形各色，最普通的是虱子、跳蚤、苍蝇和蚊子。虱子、跳蚤和苍蝇都可以粘带斑疹伤寒、霍乱、天花、鼠疫和痢疾病菌，蚊子则能粘带疟疾和黄热病的病菌。
    （注）下面的注解是钟惠澜医学博士所加的。钟氏以前是伦敦皇家热带医学及卫生学会的会员，德国汉堡热带病学校的研究员。他现在是内科学教授，为中国热带病学及传染病学第一流专家。——审讯者
    “斑疹伤寒的病原是立克次氏小体，疟疾的发生是由于疟原虫，天花和黄热病是由于两种不同的泸过性病毒所致。美国俘虏因非医务工作者，所以他把这些病原与传染病的细菌混合起来谈，是在所难免的。他对于滴滴涕的用途，亦有说错了的地方。”
    有准备是预防细菌弹之最好方法。所有可能的人员均应注射足以预防所有可能的疾病的疫苗。如果投下昆虫，最好把煤油或其他的油泼在细菌昆虫的容器上，并加焚毁。如昆虫已从容器中逸走，最好在这一区域喷撒滴滴涕，能以飞机喷撒尤佳。如果使用带细菌尘埃，更应喷撒滴滴涕，所有暴露过的食物必须清除，所有暴露过的被服和物件，必须以热水及药皂洗刷；用水必须滚开过；食物必须彻底煮熟；呼吸时口鼻必须以罩保护；诸事作毕之后，必须更衣沐浴；所有易于寄生蕃殖细菌的废物垃圾应加以焚毁。为防虫起见，夏天所有窗子应有纱窗。在任何情况下，小动物，如老鼠，因带有跳蚤，均应灭除，以减少鼠疫的危险。如投掷纸制品或其他类似物品，应立即加以焚毁。
    在使用细菌武器时，为避免伤害要撒布的细菌起见，飞机的高度和速度能愈低愈慢就愈好，如果使用装有降落伞的武器，则任何高度均适宜，但亦不应太高，以一千英尺为宜，使降落伞不致从要投掷的目标区域飘远去。
    威尔逊先生结束这一堂课时，已是下午三点钟了，他从新提醒我们，不准与任何人谈论细菌武器的问题，然后才离开教室。这种课程我们只听过一次，一九五一年九月一日我就去群山了。
    在一九五一年十月间，以及十二月间，我在群山先后共听过两次（每次一小时）有关防御细菌战的课程。教官是白朗宁少校。他这一课程是经常举行的，每一个人都必需参加听课一小时，十月间与十二月间所讲的内容是相同的，这一课程经常举行的原因是由于轮换计划的关系，不断有新部队开来；而且记住他的课程的内容对每一个人也是有益的。白朗宁少校告诉我们，敌人会对我们使用细菌战并非是一无理由的推想。如果他们使用的话，他们就会使用细菌尘埃或带细菌的昆虫。他着重地说，我们应该经常和及时地注射防疫针（按俘虏口供，每六周注射一次）。他也谈到其他一些我在这份材料的第三页第二段中所涉及到的有关资料。（按为全文的第七段——译者注）
    一九五二年一月一日，大队作战处的训令官，在我们例行的训令中告诉我们，每次执行任务后，必须报告我们所投一切“不爆炸的炸弹”（按俘虏口供：所谓“不爆炸的炸弹”意即细菌弹。以“不爆炸的炸弹”代替细菌弹旨在保密），并报告这些“不爆炸的炸弹”都落在何处。这本来就是一种普通的工作程序，并在那时看起来好像是一个顺便的提醒。这种“提醒”是由大队训令官加莱上尉在出发执行轰炸任务前给予训令时，对所有人员讲述的。这天晚上，我因头痛故未出飞。由另一领航员代替。
    我的第二次预先安排好的飞行任务，是在一九五二年一月六日。规定我们沿八号绿色航线（平壤与沙里之间）飞行，按日程表，我们在夜间三点钟出发。执行任务的人员有驾驶员阿麦斯上尉，领航员我本人及机枪手屈西军曹。和平常一样，阿麦斯上尉和我在半夜二时，即出发前一小时，到大队训令室及大队作战处办公室报到，我们经常是在这里检测气候和获得执行飞行任务的情报。在这晚，是由一个我不认识的上尉值班官给我们作指示说：我们将飞往黄州城并投掷两枚按置在机翼上的炸弹，然后尽快地把我们所带的其他炸弹投下，并直接飞返群山。他并说，在黄州投弹时，飞行高度应为五百英尺，飞行最大速度为每小时二百英里。我们提起他注意，这样的飞行高度是否合适，因为按训令我们要装载十枚重五百磅的炸弹。但他告诉我们说，这是极端秘密的，因为这是细菌弹；并说这次任务不准告诉其他任何人。他告诉我们机翼炸弹已安装好了，并已经替我们检查过了，所以不要去理它们。返防后，就把装置在机翼上的炸弹当作“不爆炸的炸弹”报告即可。然后我们到中队作战科找我们的机枪手，据我所知，他并未到大队报到，也不知道这是特殊任务。当我们出来去上飞机时，看到一个军械处派来的岗哨在那里，他告诉我们翼上炸弹已检查过了。这是我们已经知道了的。我们自己检查了在弹舱里的六枚炸弹。这是六枚普通五百磅的炸弹。三点钟的时候，我们出发飞往黄州，在城的西沿投掷了那两枚细菌弹。当时并无爆炸声，亦未看到任何特殊东西。然后我们继续向北飞了两分钟，把我们的八枚爆炸性炸弹投在距黄州北面五英里的公路上，旋即直接飞返群山。我们三点钟起飞，四点钟投掷炸弹，五点钟在群山着陆。这是我第一次听到投掷细菌弹的事，我们并把它当作秘密保守起来。对于我来说，这些细菌弹看起来完全和普通五百磅的炸弹一样。在白天，可能看出一些显著的特点，但我看见细菌弹时是在黑夜里。我自己并未按装过这种炸弹，也未见过别人按装。在机翼上并无特殊设备。因此装载细菌弹时和装载普通弹一样。
    当我们向大队情报处汇报这一任务执行情况时，我们报告说：在黄州投下两枚重五百磅的炸弹（事实上细菌弹只重一百五十磅），并在报告中称它们为“不爆炸的炸弹”，同时也报告了我们在什么地方投下了我们的八枚好炸弹。这两枚炸弹在报告中被称为“不爆炸的炸弹”显然是不让更多的人知道我们这次任务的目的。但是更高级的司令部能够核查这些报告，并知道细菌投撒在何处。
    一月十日，不知是偶然的，抑或是有计划的，同样的任务又交给了阿麦斯、屈西和我三个人。这一次阿麦斯和我先到大队作战处报到。他们告诉我们说，四枚装置在机翼上的都是细菌弹。这次的目标是八号绿色航线上的中和城。细菌弹投下后，应尽快地把其余炸弹丢掉，然后即行飞返基地。我们仍旧要对这次任务保守秘密，并在报告中称细菌弹为
    “不爆炸的炸弹”。我们投细菌弹时的最大航速为每小时二百英里。我们的飞行高度为五百英尺。仍旧由军械处为我们检查了机翼上的炸弹。我们从中队作战科里叫上了屈西，就到飞机上去。机翼上的炸弹仍旧和普通炸弹一样。一个军械处的人员对我们说，我们勿须为机翼上的炸弹担心，因为一切都已准备停当了。我在弹舱里检查了其他炸弹。三点整起飞，迳赴中和城。四点十分，以五百英尺的高度及每小时一百九十英里的速率，在中和城西沿，投下了我们的细菌弹之后，我们继续往南飞去，并在黄州以北的公路上投掷了其他普通炸弹。然后折返群山基地。着陆时是五时十五分。
    当我们回来汇报任务执行情况时，我们报告了在什么地方投下了六枚好炸弹。并报告在中和城有四枚“不爆炸的炸弹”，原因和以上所述相同，为了保守秘密。
    上图是我们所用过的细菌弹图型。我认为，细菌弹来自于制造防疫苗那一类的医药供应处。我相信这个供应处是在日本：不在本州就在九州岛。
    如果这一种我们投掷过的细菌弹被使用，它将于触地时即行开启，并把细菌和昆虫撒露于空地中，如外界天气冷，则昆虫就会蛰伏或行动缓慢，可是太阳会以其热力使它们活跃起来。
    传单是由B—29轰炸机在北朝鲜投掷的。这类传单是盛在盒子中投下的，盒子在空中就会启开，并把传单撒布在很大的地区内。这类传单能用于细菌战中。
    投掷细菌弹时，由驾驶员负责投掷；领航员负责记录投掷细菌弹的时间、地点和数目。投掷细菌弹是以电钮操纵的。
    任务完成后，当飞行人员向大队情报处报告任务执行情况时，所有全机执行任务人员均参加这一汇报，但只由驾驶员及领航员发言，这是一种非正式的汇报，全机所有人员，都围着一张桌子坐下，向一个谍报处派来的士兵汇报。他听取汇报，并把内容记在纸上，这一记录是要呈交他的上级的。这就是细菌弹在汇报中被称为“不爆炸的炸弹”的原因，以便使未授予权利的谍报人员及飞行人员不知道这种任务的秘密。
    据我所知，B—26型飞机是唯一用来投掷普通细菌弹的，这种细菌弹看上去与平常炸弹一样。究竟B—26并不适合用以投掷其他种类的武器。传单是由B—29型及C—46与C—47型运输机投掷，但主要是用B—29投掷。运输机最适合于投掷所有其他类型的细菌武器。例如硬纸盒，带降落伞的容器及衣服、食物、肥皂、纸张和自来水笔。B—29也能投掷这些武器。
    至于说到我们什么时候开始使用细菌弹，大约在年初，即约于一九五二年一月一日，因为这是我们所有的人接到注意“不爆炸的炸弹”的通知的日子。大概在其他单位，如第四百五十二轰炸联队，也是在同一时间开始进行细菌战。
    当然，使用细菌弹的决定是极端秘密的。但由于这一决定的严重性，无疑是由很高级的司令部决定的，可能是东京远东统帅部的决定。
