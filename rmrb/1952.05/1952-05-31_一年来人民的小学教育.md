The People's Elementary Education Over the Past Year
Fang Yu Yan

I. The Increase in the Number of Elementary Schools

Living in Mao Zedong's happy new era, everything has a solution, glorious achievements, and extremely broad prospects for development.

Elementary education is the primary education for children, the basic education that all people must receive from childhood. From last year's Children's Day to this year's Children's Day, the number of elementary schools nationwide has grown from over 395,800 to over 459,800, an increase of over 64,000 schools; the number of elementary school students has grown from over 29,336,000 to over 38,700,000, an increase of over 9,370,000 students. In the Northeast and North China regions, the number of children enrolled has reached 65% to 75% of the total number of school-age children in the regions.

There are over 9,100 elementary schools for ethnic minorities nationwide, and over 4,860 elementary schools that also accept ethnic minority students, with a total of over 943,000 ethnic minority children enrolled. Among them, the number of elementary schools in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has increased to over 3,700, with a total of over 307,000 students of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups, more than three times the highest figure during the Japanese puppet regime.

The Korean ethnic minority elementary schools in the Northeast have achieved even better results, with the number of children enrolled reaching about 92% of the school-age children, and elementary education is approaching universalization.

In terms of changes in the composition of students, the achievements are also considerable. Elementary schools and schools at all levels continue to implement the policy of opening their doors to workers, peasants, and soldiers, resolutely changing the composition of students. In the Northeast and North China regions, the number of children enrolled has reached 65% to 75% of the total number of school-age children in the regions, of which the number of children of workers and peasants has accounted for more than 80% of the total number of students. Elementary schools in Beijing and Tianjin have special classes for workers' children, enrolling more than 50,000 boys and girls.

The enrollment rate of workers' and peasants' children in elementary schools is required to reach 85% to 90% in old liberated areas, 60% to 70% in new liberated areas, and large and medium-sized cities should focus on increasing the enrollment of workers' children.

According to the 1952 National Elementary Education Plan, the number of elementary school students may increase by an average of about 10%. Within five years, the enrollment rate of school-age children nationwide should strive to reach 80%. Within ten years, it may be possible to universalize elementary education nationwide.

II. The Achievements of the Elementary Education Conference

The First National Elementary Education Conference was held in conjunction with the First National Normal Education Conference. The conference began on August 27, 1951. After sixteen days of plenary sessions and group discussions, major issues such as reforming the direction and tasks of national elementary education, improving the treatment of elementary school teachers, and raising the political and professional level of elementary school teachers were decided.

The conference also made decisions on the reform of elementary education and kindergarten education: it formulated the "Provisional Regulations for Elementary Schools" (draft) and the "Provisional Regulations for Kindergartens" (draft). In addition to stipulating the elementary school teaching plan, educational principles, and all-round development education methods in these two regulations, abolishing corporal punishment and reactionary courses in elementary schools, and abolishing the capitalist unit system of teaching in kindergartens, it also separately stipulated the "General Instructions for the Elementary School Teaching Syllabus," "Teaching Syllabus for Each Subject," and "Kindergarten Teaching Outline" and other drafts. This pointed out the correct direction and laid the initial foundation for the construction of elementary education and kindergarten education in the new China.

III. New Embodiment of the School System Reform

On October 1, 1951, the "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on the Reform of the School System" was promulgated. This "Decision on the Reform of the School System" is an embodiment of Chairman Mao's educational thought and educational policy in the current stage of education system in the new China. This is an epoch-making event in the history of Chinese education; it is a major event to end the colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal education system in China for more than fifty years; it is a major event to establish a truly Chinese people's own education system with the integration of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, after the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War.

In elementary schools, why should the "4-2" system of six-year elementary schools be changed to a five-year integrated elementary school? This is mainly to enable the children of farmers in rural areas and the children of workers in cities to receive equal opportunities for basic national education. Because the old school system of six years of elementary school divided into primary and senior levels in the past was a system that hindered the children of the broad working people from receiving complete elementary education. Our reform can not only ensure that the children of farmers in rural areas and the children of workers in cities receive the same five years of education, but also ensure that the level of the new five-year elementary school is no lower than that of the old six-year elementary school. How can this goal be achieved? It is:

(1) Raising the age of admission for children: The standard age of admission is raised from six years old in the past to seven full years old. When the age of admission for children is raised, the children's ability to accept is also enhanced, and it is easier for them to accept six years of courses in five years. (2) Streamlining teaching materials: On the one hand, the repeated parts of the curriculum are deleted, saving a lot of time; on the other hand, the time for major subjects such as Chinese and arithmetic is increased, so there is no fear that five years will not reach the level of six years. (3) Improving teaching methods and improving teacher quality. In this way, the teaching effect can of course be improved. These three conditions are the main key to reforming elementary schools into a five-year integrated system.

The most important thing is that when the five-year integrated system is implemented this fall, it will only start from the new students in the first grade, and all grades will not be changed at once. Because the new textbooks suitable for the five-year integrated elementary school can only publish the first volume of Chinese and arithmetic before the start of school this fall; if the grades are compiled and the progress is accelerated, and all grades are changed at once, it will inevitably cause great confusion in the curriculum and be strenuous and unrewarding. When the textbook conditions are available next year, then engage in compiling grades and shortening the years of the reformed elementary school system.

IV. A Large Number of People's Elementary School Teachers Emerged

People's teacher is the glorious title of the Mao Zedong era, and the unique glorious title of the People's Republic of China.

Today's normal school students are tomorrow's people's teachers. Being a normal school student and a people's elementary school teacher in the new China of the Mao Zedong era has extremely broad prospects and a bright future.

Since the establishment of the new China, many elementary school teachers who wholeheartedly serve the people's education have emerged in various places: Zhang Junde of the Xi'an Normal School Affiliated Elementary School is the creator of the "Lunar Earth Operation Instrument" (formerly known as the Three-Sphere Instrument). He is a model elementary school teacher who is hardworking, simple, patient, willing to use his brain, and willing to create with his hands. He was originally an unknown elementary school teacher in Hu County. Six or seven years ago, he created the "Three-Sphere Instrument" in order to solve the difficulty of teaching nature. At that time, he had repeatedly requested the assistance of the Kuomintang reactionary government, but not only did he not get help, but he was also despised, ridiculed, and coldly treated by the reactionaries. After the liberation of the Northwest, thanks to the material assistance and spiritual encouragement of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government, his "Three-Sphere Instrument" has been greatly improved since then, and has been continuously rewarded by the Cultural Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and the National Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union. When Zhang Junde came to Beijing last fall, he was introduced by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I personally accompanied him to visit Professor Dai Wensai, a famous astronomer at Yenching University, and immediately obtained Professor Dai Wensai's careful guidance. The Academy of Sciences also introduced him to visit the Nanjing Astronomical Meteorological Observatory, which gave him more astronomical knowledge. After Zhang Junde returned to Xi'an, he worked hard day and night, making his "Lunar Earth Operation Instrument" greatly improved. Following this, he also created the "Wind and Rain Experiment Device." This year's International Children's Day, these two instruments will be publicly displayed in Beihai Park in Beijing, which will definitely have a great impact on the creation of teaching aids and teaching methods. Lang Jiehua in Beijing is an ambitious young woman. She initially followed her father to engage in rural elementary education in Lulong County, Hebei, and was subsequently assigned to teach elementary school in Xiazhuang, a small mountain village near the foot of the Great Wall in the Third District of Lulong County, Hebei. The school buildings and equipment were all burned and ruined by the Japanese invaders and the puppet Manchukuo army. Under the conditions of having nothing, she contacted cadres, contacted the masses, and thought of many ways to overcome difficulties, so that textile girls and cattle-herding children could receive education. She was elected as the vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union the year before last, and has dedicated all her energy to working tirelessly for the national people's education cause. Shi Ruifen, a young female elementary school teacher in Southern Jiangsu, came to Qingshuitang, Liyang County, Southern Jiangsu, a rural area with severe famine, to run an elementary school. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, she resolutely followed the mass line, shared weal and woe with the farmers, and moved the masses, making them pay attention to education. Finally, she successfully ran the elementary school in a dilapidated old ancestral hall without a gate. She also concurrently ran winter schools for farmers and literacy classes for women. She tirelessly carried out patriotic education of resisting the United States and aiding Korea among the masses, publicized the land reform policy, and worked hard to improve rural health work; she even worked as a midwife to deliver babies for rural women. She not only ran the school well, but also ran mass education very well. Lu Jingxian of Jingwei Elementary School in Harbin became an elementary school teacher after graduating from middle school. One day, she accidentally read the introduction to "My Child Education Work" by Glonitskaya: "The kindergarten where she (referring to Glonitskaya) started as a teacher was one of the first kindergartens opened by the Soviet regime in Moscow. This was in 1917. This young girl immediately poured all her strength into the new work. The difficulties she encountered at the beginning made her realize that to do a good job in the work she has chosen, she must study extensively and stubbornly." In particular, the nine characters "all her strength" and "stubbornly study" aroused Lu Jingxian's contemplation and turned into the driving force for her to pursue progress. Since then, she has worked even harder to stubbornly study new teaching methods, and strived to do a good job in classroom teaching, so that what she teaches can be easily accepted and consolidated by children, and become children's own solid knowledge. This is how she loves children, loves work, and loves to study, making herself progress every day, and making elementary education progress every day. She returned to China from studying in the Soviet Union last fall, and was entrusted by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government to participate in the summary work of the curriculum reform experiment of six five-year integrated elementary schools in Beijing. Soon, she will return to her work post at Jingwei Elementary School to continue studying her elementary education business. Song Bing, a teacher at Hejiatang Elementary School in Hang County, Zhejiang, is also a young girl. She can not only run her own elementary school well, but also organize children outside the school who cannot enter the school through the Young Pioneers to carry out learning. She has achieved results and won the faith of the local masses and the praise of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Culture and Education. Hu Bingzhen and Peng Yimei and other five elementary school teachers in Menghua County, Yunnan, under extremely difficult conditions, actively improved the elementary education of ethnic minorities in remote, poor, and backward areas with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods, and were loved by the local people and cherished by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Culture and Education. Gao Desan is a teacher at Balege Dai Elementary School in Keerqin Right Front Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Since he participated in elementary education work in 1947, he has regarded education as his lifelong career and the school as his life. Therefore, he is actively responsible, closely connects with the masses, is good at overcoming difficulties, and has fulfilled his responsibilities for elementary education work and the people's education cause. Chen Jingyin is an elementary school teacher in Beiquti, Fourth District, Anxin County, Hebei Province. He actively publicized and explained the principles of "production for self-help" and "saving and overcoming famine," and solicited opinions from parents, insisting on and stabilizing education in disaster areas. Zhang Xuexian, a young elementary school teacher in Liaodong, is good at grasping the situation, changing the situation, and running the people's elementary education well. Shi Pijun in Songjiang Province is a young man who fled to Baoqing due to famine and only studied for two and a half years. Because he had sold "coolie" to the Japanese devils and suffered all kinds of hardships, he had a high degree of awareness, so he started an elementary school in a mountain valley where there had never been any culture to educate the children of the poor people. He overcame the conspiracies of landlords, running dogs, and hooligans, and continued to move forward. He overcame the difficulties of his own unfamiliar teaching methods and continued to move forward in creating teaching methods suitable for the situation at the time.

Some of these people's teachers and people's heroes have won the glorious title of "Model Teacher" or "Excellent Teacher," and some have been elected as vice chairmen or members of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union; in the last quarter of 1951, some of them participated in The First National Elementary Education Conference and Normal Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, and some were invited to attend the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, personally met Chairman Mao, and personally received Chairman Mao's encouragement. This is the brilliant achievement of elementary school teachers in the new China, and also the bright and splendid prospect of elementary school teachers in the new China. For example, in the Anhui North and Jiangsu North regions, due to the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they have suffered from the Yellow River breach, the Huai River siltation and flooding for years, and have been devastated by the Chiang bandit gang. The people have suffered deeply, displaced, and have no time to save the dying, and have no ability to take care of children's education. However, after liberation, thanks to thousands of people's teachers, under the unified leadership of the People's Government, teachers and students jointly labored and produced, and insisted on education in disaster areas. These people's teachers in disaster areas are truly the elites on the cultural and educational front and the treasures of national cultural and educational construction, which are admirable.

There are many outstanding elementary school teachers in Beijing, such as Guan Minqing, Huo Maozheng, Ma Yingzhen, Xue Lianrui, Zhao Guangfu, Song Fan, Liu Rong, Wang Shulan, Bai Rongfen, Zhang Shangpu, Man Jingzhen, Huang Jinhui, Zhou Wenyu, Liu Shide, Jin Haoyi, etc., who are wholeheartedly dedicated to the curriculum reform experiment of the five-year integrated elementary school under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture and Education, and are tirelessly engaged in in-depth research. They have achieved certain results in doing a good job in classroom teaching and streamlining teaching materials, which will play a certain role in promoting the implementation of the new school system starting this fall.

These excellent people's elementary school teachers are good examples for every elementary school teacher and normal school student who loves to learn and loves the truth in the new China. The Central People's Government and Chairman Mao are concerned about the learning and health of every people's elementary school teacher and normal school student in the country, and have decided that all normal school students in the country will enjoy full public funding, and are preparing to adjust the material treatment of elementary school teachers across the country. The old era that looked down on elementary school teachers is gone forever, and the old era that thought that normal school students were unpromising is also gone forever.

Elementary school teacher comrades: As long as you wholeheartedly serve the people's elementary education, the people will constantly care for and love you, so that you can continue to move forward and happily go upwards. Comrades: Bear well the glorious title of the people's teacher in the new China! Shoulder well the noble task of educating the new generation! Do a good job as a powerful assistant to the People's Government in connecting with the masses! Unite and rise up to fight to the end for the noble task of creating and realizing the new elementary education of the new China!

    一年来人民的小学教育
    方与严
    一、小学数目的增加
    生活在毛泽东的幸福新时代，一切都有了办法，都有了光辉的成就和极其宽广的发展前途。
    小学教育是儿童的初等教育，是全体人民从小必须受的基础教育。从去年的儿童节到今年的儿童节，全国小学校数由三十九万五千八百余所，发展到四十五万九千八百余所，增加了六万四千余所；小学生数目已由二千九百三十三万六千余人，发展到三千八百七十万余人。增加了九百三十七万余人。东北区和华北区入学儿童已达全区学龄儿童总数的百分之六十五至七十五。
    全国少数民族小学有九千一百余所，兼收少数民族学生的小学有四千八百六十余所，各少数民族入学儿童共有九十四万三千余人。其中内蒙古自治区的小学，已增至三千七百余所，蒙汉等民族学生共达三十万七千余人。比日伪统治时期最高数字增加了三倍以上。
    东北的朝鲜民族小学更有很好的成就，入学儿童已达学龄儿童的百分之九十二左右，小学教育已接近普及程度。
    从学生成分的改变来说，成绩也是可观的。小学和各级学校同样地继续贯彻着向工农兵开门的方针，坚决改变学生的成分。在东北和华北区入学儿童已达全区学龄儿童总数的百分之六十五至七十五，其中工农子女数目已占学生总数的百分之八十以上。北京市和天津市的小学，则有专为工人子女开设的班次，招收了五万以上的男女儿童入学。
    初等学校工农子女入学的比率，要求老区争取达到百分之八十五至九十，新区争取达到百分之六十至七十，大、中城市小学以增收工人子女为主要任务。
    按照一九五二年全国初等教育计划，小学生数目平均可能增加百分之十左右。五年之内，全国学龄儿童入学数目要争取达到百分之八十。十年之内，全国小学教育即有可能普及。
    二、初等教育会议的成就
    第一次全国初等教育会议是和第一次全国师范教育会议合并召开的。会议在一九五一年八月二十七日开始，经过十六天的大会和分组讨论，决定了改革全国小学教育的方针、任务和改善小学教师待遇，以及提高小学教师政治水平和业务水平等等的重大问题。
    这次会议，对小学教育和幼儿园教育也作出了改革的决定：拟订了“小学暂行规程”（草案）及“幼儿园暂行规程”（草案）。除在这两项规程中订出小学教学计划、教育原则、全面发展的教育方法，小学废除体罚和反动的课程及幼儿园废除资产阶级的单元制教学外，并另规定了“小学教学大纲总说明”和“各科教学大纲”，以及“幼儿园教学纲要”等草案，这就给建设新中国的小学教育和幼儿园教育指出了正确的方向和奠定初基。
    三、学制改革的新体现
    在一九五一年十月一日，“中央人民政府政务院关于改革学制的决定”公布了。这个“改革学制的决定”，是毛主席的教育思想和教育政策在新中国现阶段教育制度上的一种体现。这是中国教育史上划时代的大事件；是结束中国五十多年来殖民地、半殖民地、半封建教育制度的大事件；是在中国人民解放战争大胜利之后，用马克思列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想建立真正的中国人民自己的教育制度的大事件。
    在小学方面，为什么要将“四、二”制六年小学改为五年一贯制的小学呢？这主要是为了使乡村的农民子女和城市工人的子女，都能受到机会均等的国民基础教育。因为过去的小学修业年限六年并分为初、高两级的旧学制，是妨碍广大劳动人民子女受到完全的初等教育的制度。而我们这样的改革，不仅可以保证乡村农民子女和城市工人子女受同样五年的教育，而且新制五年小学的程度，保证不低于旧制六年小学的程度。怎样才能达到这个目的呢？就是：
    （一）提高儿童入学年龄：由过去的六岁提高到七足岁为标准入学年龄。儿童入学年龄提高，儿童的接受能力也增强了，他们在五年间接受六年的课程，就比较容易。（二）精简教材：一方面把课程中重复的部分删掉，节省了不少时间；一方面主要科目如语文、算术的时间却增加了，不怕五年达不到六年的程度。（三）改进教学方法，提高教师质量。这样，教学的效果当然可以提高。这三个条件，是改革小学为五年一贯制的主要关键。
    最要紧的是在今年秋季开始实行五年一贯制时，只是从第一学年的新生开始，并不一下就把各学年一时都改。因为适合五年一贯制小学的新课本，在今年秋季开学前，只能出版语文和算术的第一册；如果编级赶进度，各学年一下子就改，在课程上自会造成很大的纷乱，吃力不讨好的。等明年课本条件具备时，再从事编级缩短改革小学学制的年限。
    四、涌现出大批人民小学教师
    人民教师，是毛泽东时代的光荣称号，是中华人民共和国特有的光荣称号。
    今天的师范生，即是明天的人民教师。在毛泽东时代的新中国做一个师范生和做一个人民的小学教师，是有极其宽广的前途和光辉灿烂的远景的。
    从新中国建立以来，各地已涌现出许多全心全意为人民教育服务的小学教师：西安师范附属小学张俊德是“月地运行仪”（原名三球仪）的创制者。他是一个坚苦朴素，耐心工作，肯开动脑筋和肯用手创造的模范小学教师。他原为鄠县一个不知名的小学教师。在六七年前，他为着要解决教学自然的困难而创制“三球仪”。当时他曾经多次要求国民党反动政府的协助，不但没有得到帮助，反而受尽了反动派的鄙视、嘲笑和冷淡。西北解放后，由于得到了陕西省人民政府的物质援助和精神鼓励，他的“三球仪”从此大有改进，连续得到西北军政委员会文化部、中央人民政府教育部、中国教育工会全国委员会的奖励。去年秋季张俊德来北京时，又经中国科学院的介绍，由我亲自陪他同去访问了燕京大学名天文学家戴文赛教授，即时获得了戴文赛教授的细心指点。科学院又介绍他去南京参观天文气象台，使他获得了更多的天文学知识。张俊德回到西安后，日夜辛劳地运用心思，使他创制的“月地运行仪”又大大地提高一步。继此以后，他又创制了“风雨实验器”，今年国际儿童节，这两个仪器将在北京市北海公园公开展览，这对创造教具和教学方法上一定有很大的影响。北京郎洁华是个有志的女青年。她起初跟着父亲在河北卢龙县从事乡村小学教育，继被派到紧靠着长城脚下的一个小山庄——河北卢龙县三区下庄教小学。这个学校的校舍和设备，都被日寇伪满军队烧毁和糟蹋精光了。她在一无所有的条件下，联系干部，联系群众，想了许多克服困难的办法，使纺织女孩和放牛儿童都受到了教育。她前年已当选为中国教育工会全国委员会副主席，更献出她的全部精力来为全国人民教育事业而不疲倦地工作着。苏南女青年小学教师史瑞芬，在有严重的灾荒的农村里——苏南溧阳县清水塘来办小学。她在党和人民政府领导下坚决走群众路线，和农民同甘苦共患难，感动了群众，使群众重视了教育，终于在没有大门的破败不堪的旧祠堂里把小学办好。她还兼办了农民的冬学和妇女识字班。她不疲倦地在群众中进行抗美援朝的爱国主义教育，宣传土地改革政策，并努力改进乡村卫生工作；甚至做接生婆，为乡村妇女接生孩子。她不只办好了学校，并且也把群众教育办得很好。哈尔滨经纬小学的吕敬先在中学毕业后还是一个年轻的姑娘，便做了小学教师。她在一天偶然阅读了葛洛尼茨卡雅著的“我的儿童教育工作”的介绍词：“她（指葛洛尼茨卡雅）开始当教员的那个幼儿园，是苏维埃政权在莫斯科最初开办的一个幼儿园。这是在一九一七年。这位年轻的姑娘立即把全副力量贯注到新的工作上来。她在开始时所遇到的困难，使她体验到：要作好她所选择的这件工作，就得要浩繁而顽强地钻研。”其中尤以“全副力量”和“顽强地钻研”九字引起了吕敬先的沉思，化作她追求进步的动力。她从此就更加用全副精力顽强地钻研新的教学方法，努力搞好课堂教学，使自己所教的东西，马上为孩子容易接受并巩固起来，变成孩子们自己的巩固的知识。她就是这样热爱孩子，热爱工作，热爱钻研，使自己天天在进步，使小学教育也天天在进步。她去秋从苏联学习回国，即接受中央人民政府教育部的委托，参加了北京市六所五年一贯制小学的课程改革实验的总结工作。不久，她又要回到经纬小学的工作岗位上，继续钻研她的小学教育业务了。浙江杭县贺家塘小学教师宋冰，也是一个年轻姑娘。她不仅能把自己的小学办好，而且把校外不能进学校的儿童，通过少年儿童队把他们组织起来进行学习，已著有成绩，获得当地群众的信仰和浙江省文教厅的褒扬。云南蒙化县的小学教师忽秉珍、彭以美等五人，在极端困难的条件下，用革命的精神和革命办法，积极地改进了边远贫瘠落后地区的少数民族的小学教育，为当地人民所爱戴，为云南省文教厅所珍视。高德三是内蒙古自治区科尔沁右前旗八列格歹小学的教师。他从一九四七年参加小学教育工作时起，便把教育事业当作自己的一生事业，把学校看成自己的生命。因此积极负责，密切联系群众，善于克服困难，对小学教育工作和人民教育事业尽了很好的责任。陈敬寅是河北省安新县四区北曲堤的小学教师。他积极宣传和解释“生产自救”“节约度荒”的道理，并征求家长意见，坚持和稳定了灾区教育。辽东青年小学教师张学贤，善于掌握情况，改变情况，办好了人民的小学教育。松江省石丕君是一个逃荒到宝清，仅念过两年半书的青年。他因为给日本鬼子卖过“苦力”，受尽了苦，觉悟程度高，就在从来没有文化的山沟里办起小学来，教育穷苦人民的子女。他战胜着地主、走狗、二流子的阴谋，不断前进，他在克服着自己教学方法不熟练的困难、创造适合当时当地情况的教学方法中不断前进。
    这些人民教师，人民功臣，有的获得了“模范教师”或“优秀教师”的光荣称号，有的当选为中国教育工会全国委员会的副主席或委员；在一九五一年下季，他们有的参加了中央人民政府教育部召集的第一次全国初等教育及师范教育会议，有的被邀列席中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议，亲自见到毛主席，亲自受到毛主席的鼓励。这就是新中国小学教师的辉煌成就，也是新中国小学教师的光辉灿烂的远景。他如：皖北和苏北地区，由于国民党反动派长期的统治，连年遭受黄河决口、淮河淤塞泛滥之灾，又遭蒋匪帮的摧残，人民灾难深重，颠沛流离，救死不暇，无力照顾儿童教育。但在解放以后，由于成千成百的人民教师，在人民政府的统一领导之下，师生共同劳动生产，坚持了灾区教育。这些灾区的人民教师，真是文化教育战线上的精英，国家文化教育建设上的珍宝，令人敬重。
    在北京有很多优秀的小学教师，如关敏卿、霍懋征、马英贞、薛莲蕊、赵广福、宋泛、刘容、王淑兰、白荣芬、张尚璞、满静桢、黄锦辉、周文郁、刘师德、金好仪等，正在中央人民政府教育部和北京市人民政府文教局直接领导下，全心全意为五年一贯制小学的课程改革实验，而献出他们的全部心思才力，不知疲倦地在深入研究。他们在搞好课堂教学和精简教材方面已经获得了一定的成绩，对于今年秋季开始实行新学制，将起一定的推进作用。
    这些优秀的人民小学教师，都是新中国每一个小学教师和今天爱学习、爱真理的师范生的好榜样。中央人民政府和毛主席正在关怀着全国每一位人民的小学教师以及在校师范生的学习情况和身体健康情况，已经决定全国师范生一律享受全部公费待遇，并正在准备调整全国小学教师的物质待遇。那看不起小学教师的旧时代，已经一去不复返了，那认为师范生是没出息的旧时代，也一去不复返了。
    小学教师同志们：只要你们全心全意为人民小学教育服务，人民一定不断地关心着和爱护着你们，使你们不断前进，愉快地向上。同志们：很好地承受着新中国人民教师光荣的称号吧！很好地担负起教育新后代的崇高任务吧！很好地做人民政府联系群众的有力助手吧！一致奋起为创造和实现新中国新的小学教育的崇高任务而奋斗到底吧！
