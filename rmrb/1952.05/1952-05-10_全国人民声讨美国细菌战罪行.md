Xinhua News Agency report: People from Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, Northwest, and Southwest China have expressed great anger at the crimes of the American invaders who planned and carried out large-scale germ warfare, as confessed by two captured American Air Force pilots.

    The Northeast Temporary Working Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, the Northeast General Branch Temporary Working Committee of the China Democratic League, and the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association jointly issued a statement on the 6th, stating: The towering crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare against the people of China and Korea have long been irrefutable. Now, the confessions, broadcasts, and open letters of captured American Air Force Lieutenants Enoch and Quinn have once again exposed the inside story of the American aggressors' launch of germ warfare. Based on new and irrefutable evidence, we once again protest the monstrous crimes of the American jackals. We call on all peace-loving people around the world to unite more closely, vigorously denounce and judge the crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out germ warfare, and fight to the end to defend peace and the survival of mankind! The Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, the Northeast Student Federation, the Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Northeast Association of Health Workers, and the Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other organizations issued a joint statement on the 6th, stating: The people of the Northeast, who have personally suffered from the poison of American germ warfare, are filled with hatred for the American war criminals who launched the germ warfare after seeing these evil facts confessed by the captured American Air Force pilots. At the same time, our experience in the anti-germ warfare struggle over the past few months has proven that the power of the people is strong and can defeat all barbarous and brutal aggressors.

    Northeast scientists have also voiced their denunciation of the American aggressors' large-scale use of bacteriological weapons. Jin Shuliang, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and president of the Northeast Institute of Technology, Li Xun, director of the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhang Jiefan, director of the Northeast Institute for the Prevention and Treatment of Plague, Zhang Kewei, chairman of the Northeast Association of Natural Science Workers, Que Senhua, vice president of the China Medical University, and Xia Dezhao, associate professor of ophthalmology at the China Medical University, all expressed their determination to completely crush germ warfare and demanded that conscientious scientists around the world stand up to stop the US crimes of carrying out germ warfare.

    The North China Branch of the Resist-US Aggression and Aid-Korea General Branch, the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the North China Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued statements respectively, unanimously pointing out that the US aggressors' crimes of carrying out germ warfare can never be denied by the likes of Truman, Acheson, and Ridgway. The ironclad evidence is like a mountain, and the noose of justice is being prepared to give the germ warfare criminals the final judgment. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Resist-US Aggression and Aid-Korea General Branch and other units, as well as medical workers and educators stationed in Zhangjiakou City, Inner Mongolia, held meetings on the 6th and 7th respectively, denouncing the heinous crimes and shameless denials of the American invading army. Medical workers from all over North China expressed their willingness to join the anti-epidemic team to Korea to crush US imperialism's germ warfare with practical actions. Famous labor models, university professors, medical workers, and representatives of various people's organizations in Tianjin sent letters to Tianjin newspapers, expressing their unparalleled anger at the crimes of the invading American army in Korea for carrying out germ warfare as confessed by the two captured American Air Force personnel. Labor model Pan Changyou said: "We can never tolerate the insane crimes of the American aggressors. The ironclad evidence, time and time again, is placed before the people of the world, and it can never be denied by a small group of germ warfare criminals." In addition, students, women, shop assistants, industrialists and businessmen, and childcare workers in Tianjin also unanimously protested, condemning the heinous crimes of US imperialism in carrying out germ warfare.

    Local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai and various people's organizations in Shanghai issued statements on the 7th, denouncing the US aggressors' crimes of carrying out germ warfare. Yan Fuqing, chairman of the Shanghai Medical Workers Resist-US Aggression and Aid-Korea Committee, Wu Ruo'an, vice chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Education Trade Union, Lu Yudao, chairman of the Shanghai Association for Science Popularization, Zhang Jin, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the National Association of Literary Workers, Chen Daxie, Dean of Studies at Jiaotong University, Ni Baochun, Dean of the Medical School of St. John's University, Chen Renbing, Dean of the College of Arts, Yang Shida, Dean of the Medical School of Aurora University, Zhou Yutong, Hu Quyuan, and Zhang Mengwen, professors at Fudan University, religious democratic figures Wu Yaozong, Liu Liangmo, and Hu Wenyao, industrial labor models Lu Agou and Zhang Deqing, Zhou Xinfang, chairman of the Shanghai Opera Improvement Association, Rong Yiren, deputy director of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and others also published special articles in Shanghai newspapers on the 7th, denouncing the US aggressors' heinous crimes of massacring the people of China and Korea with bacteriological weapons; and unanimously pointed out that the evidence of the US aggressors' germ warfare is already very solid, and the day of judging the American germ warfare criminals is approaching. Jiang Sichang, Dean of the University Hospital affiliated with the National Nanjing University Medical College, Zhou Yuwen, professor and director of the Department of Bacteriology at the Nanjing University Medical College, Peng Zuoquan, associate professor of the Department of Botany at Jinling University, Dai Anbang, Dean of the College of Science at Jinling University, Hong Shil√º, Dean of the Zhejiang Medical College and microbiology expert, and Tu Baoqi, director of the Department of Bacteriology at the Zhejiang Medical College, all made speeches, firmly believing that the American germ warfare criminals will be justly judged by the people of the world.

    The Central South Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Democratic Women's Federation both denounced the towering crimes of the American aggressors. Dong Gongzhen, director and professor of the Bacteriology Museum of the Central South Tongji Medical College, said: "The confessions of the American prisoners Enoch and Quinn fully demonstrate that the vicious plan of the American aggressors to carry out germ warfare was extremely secret, and at the same time, it proves that they are extremely timid. We must strengthen the work of anti-germ warfare so that the organizers of germ warfare are finally sanctioned." Yao Yongzheng, director and professor of the Parasitology Museum of the same college, Yao Kefang, director of Xiehe Hospital, Li Zhishang, director of the Department of Pathology, Xu Biaoxiu, professor of bacteriology, and more than ten others unanimously stated that they would respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the forefront of the anti-germ warfare. After seeing the confessions of the captured American Air Force personnel, people from all walks of life in Hunan Province pledged to support the Volunteer Army with positive actions of increasing production and practicing thrift to severely strike the American aggressors.

    The joint statement of the Northwest General Branch and Xi'an Branch of the China Democratic League, the Preparatory Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, and the Preparatory Committee of the Xi'an Branch of the Democratic National Construction Association stated: The confessions, broadcasts, and open letters of American Air Force prisoners Enoch and Quinn show that the American aggressors can no longer quibble and deny in front of the Korean-Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world, and have aroused even more resentment among the Korean-Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world towards the inhumane American aggressors. The despicable acts of the American aggressors, such as secretly lecturing on germ warfare, injecting "vaccines that cannot be disclosed due to military secrets," and calling germ bombs "non-explosive bombs," fully demonstrate their extremely guilty criminal psychology in carrying out germ warfare. All the human and material evidence about the US carrying out germ warfare is now even more complete, and we believe that the day of the final judgment of the American aggressors' germ warfare crimes by righteous humanity is approaching.

    People's organizations such as the Chongqing Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Youth Federation, the Student Federation, the Primary School Teachers Federation, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce all issued statements saying: The US aggressors' attempt to quibble about their crimes of carrying out germ warfare by various despicable means has completely failed, and the confessions of the two captured American Air Force personnel have provided undeniable evidence. Staff members of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau held a symposium on the 6th, at which it was unanimously pointed out that the confessions of the American prisoners Enoch and Quinn thoroughly exposed the US's deliberate conspiracy to use bacteriological weapons. Local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing and various people's organizations in Chongqing have issued written statements. They demand that righteous humanity give a solemn judgment on the American aggressors' unforgivable crimes of carrying out germ warfare.
