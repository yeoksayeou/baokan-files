Visiting Indian Trade Union Delegation: Saxena

“Your May Day gave me one of the most amazing experiences of my life. The spontaneous enthusiasm and joy of your people convinced me that you truly have a people's revolution.” Indian trade union representative, President of the All India Sugar Workers' Federation, Saxena, began his conversation like this when he met with reporters. He said: "I had been told before that the Chinese people are under a dictatorial political rule and are forced to do things; however, just from the facts shown on May Day, I discovered that everyone of you is completely free. You all wholeheartedly love your government and leaders, because the People's Government and its leaders have served the people so well in the past three years. I can say that the spirit shown by the Chinese people on May Day is a new revolutionary spirit that cannot be destroyed by germ bombs, atomic bombs, or even hydrogen bombs. I firmly believe that China needs peace, but is also ready to counterattack any provocation by aggressors at any time! I feel that the growth of China's peaceful people's power will be one of the strongest fortresses of peace in Asia and the world."

Although Saxena has not been in China for long, he already feels that the Chinese people have a very deep friendship and affection for them. He told a short story: On the evening of May Day, Saxena and two other representatives from the delegation attended the get-together at Tiananmen Square. Despite the rain, they walked into the dense crowd. The young men and women dancing and singing there discovered them and enthusiastically welcomed the three of them to join the games. Saxena said: "We will never forget the friendship and enthusiasm of the Chinese youth towards us."

The Indian trade union delegation has visited our rural areas and schools in the city and suburbs of Beijing for several days, and also visited the exhibition room of the crimes of bacteriological warfare by American imperialism. Saxena said: "When we visited the countryside, we saw deeply one aspect of the Chinese revolution. It was a small rural village after land reform. The village chief vividly described to us the process of land reform and the distribution of land. Many farmers who had no land now have land, and production has increased by nearly double in just two years. All the farmers are living happily. The situation in this rural village convinces me that land reform has been widely welcomed by the people."

He said: "We visited Renmin University and learned that it is a new type of university. Many labor heroes and some cadres with excellent achievements are receiving specialized training there in order to better undertake their work. We also visited a teaching and research office of the school, and I thought it was excellent. As a university professor, I should learn your new working methods in teaching."

Saxena said that after visiting the germ warfare exhibition, he felt the greatest revulsion towards those who adopted the barbaric method of germ warfare. Before coming to China, an American journalist asked Saxena whether he believed China's accusation of bacteriological warfare launched by American imperialism, but he did not have sufficient facts to prove it. "When I saw this exhibition," Saxena said excitedly, "these physical objects, eyewitness testimonies, reliable investigation reports from several investigation teams, and the prisoner's handwritten confessions and his recordings all tell me that the bacteriological warfare carried out by American imperialism is real. People generally do not believe the prisoner's confessions; however, with so much reliable evidence, I also believe in the reliability of the confessions. I feel that China has sufficient reason and evidence for its accusation of bacteriological warfare carried out by American imperialism, and all these evidences cannot be false or fabricated. The fact that American germ bombs were dropped in places where no insects could possibly occur under the climate at that time strongly supports China's accusation. After seeing this exhibition, I felt the greatest revulsion towards those who adopted this barbaric method." Saxena then pointed out that American imperialism was the first country to drop atomic bombs and also the first country to drop germ bombs. However, the atomic bombs were not dropped on Germany but on Japan, and the germ bombs were not dropped in Europe but in China and Korea. Therefore, he said: "Asians will not forget that American imperialism chose Asians as the targets of atomic bomb and germ bomb attacks."

Saxena has been a member of the Indian Parliament for the past six years. He has tried his best to oppose India from joining the Anglo-American totalitarian group and advocated promoting relations between India and the Soviet Union and China. Saxena said: "The experience of the Chinese people's revolution can give us a lot of help, and I will study your revolution in detail. I am very excited and happy to see the situation in all aspects of New China during this visit. After I return to my country, I will definitely give a fair and unbiased account to the Indian people, let the Indian people know the truth about you, and will do my best to promote the establishment of close relations between India and the Soviet Union and China—the camp of peace."

### 访印度工会代表团萨克森纳

    访印度工会代表团萨克森纳
    “你们的五一节给了我一生中最惊奇的一个经验，你们人民那种自发的热情和快乐，使我信服你们真的有了一个人民的革命。”印度工会代表、全印糖业工人联合会主席萨克森纳在接见记者时这样开始了他的谈话。他说：“以前有人告诉我：中国人民是在独裁政治统治之下的，是被强迫作事情的；但是，仅从五一节那天所表现的事实，我就发现：你们每一个人是完全自由的。你们都衷心热爱你们的政府和领袖，因为三年来人民政府和它的领导者对人民的服务是太好了。我可以这样说，中国人民在五一节所表现的精神，是一种不论细菌弹、原子弹、甚或氢气弹都不能摧毁的新的革命精神。我深信中国是需要和平的，但也准备随时反击侵略者的任何挑衅！我感到中国和平人民力量的增长将是亚洲和世界和平最坚强的堡垒之一。”
    虽然萨克森纳到中国还不久，他已感觉中国人民对他们有一种非常深厚的友谊和感情。他讲了一个小故事：五一节的晚上，萨克森纳和代表团中的另外两位代表参加了天安门广场的联欢会。他们不顾天雨，走入密集的人群。在那里跳舞、唱歌的青年男女发现了他们，热情地欢迎他们三人参加游戏。萨克森纳说：“我们将永远不会忘记中国青年对我们的友谊和热情。”
    印度工会代表团连日在北京城内和郊区参观了我们的农村、学校，并且还参观了美帝国主义细菌战罪行的展览室。萨克森纳说：“我们参观农村时，深入地看见了中国革命的一个方面。那是一个经过土地改革的小农村。村长生动地为我们叙述了土地改革的经过和分配土地的情形。许多没有土地的农民现在都有了土地了，生产量在短短两年中间增加了将近一倍。所有的农民都生活得很快乐。这个农村的情形，使我信服土地改革已受到人民广泛的欢迎。”
    他说：“我们参观了人民大学，知道这是一所新型的大学。许多劳动英雄和一些成绩优良的干部都在那里受专门的训练，以便更好地担负起他们的工作。我们还参观了该校的一个教学研究室，我觉得它好极了。作为一个大学教授，我是应当学习你们在教学上新的工作方法的。”
    萨克森纳说，参观了细菌战展览，他对采取细菌战这种野蛮方法的人发生了最大的反感。萨克森纳在来中国之前，曾有一个美国新闻记者问他相信不相信中国对于美帝国主义发动的细菌战的控诉，但他没有充分事实来证明。“当我看了这个展览会，”萨克森纳激动地说：“这些实物，目击者的证明，好几个调查团可靠的调查报告，俘虏的亲笔供状和他的录音，都告诉我美帝国主义所进行的细菌战是真实的。人们一般不相信俘虏的供状；但是有了这么多可靠的证据，也就使我相信供状的可靠性。我感觉中国对美帝国主义所进行的细菌战的控诉有足够的理由和证据，所有这些证据都不可能是假的或是被制造出来的。美国细菌弹投到在当时的气候下不可能发生任何昆虫的地方，这就有力地支持了中国的控诉。看了这个展览会，我对采取这种野蛮方法的人起了最大的反感。”萨克森纳接着指出：美帝国主义是第一个投原子弹的国家，又是第一个投细菌弹的国家。但是原子弹不投在德国而投在日本，细菌弹不投在欧洲而投在中国和朝鲜。因此他说：“亚洲人是不会忘记美帝国主义选择亚洲人作为原子弹和细菌弹袭击的对象的。”
    萨克森纳在过去的六年中都是印度国会议员，他曾竭力反对印度走入英美极权集团，而主张促进印度和苏联、中国的关系。萨克森纳说：“中国人民革命的经验，可以给我们很多的帮助，我将要详细研究你们的革命。我这次访问，亲自看到新中国各方面的情形，非常兴奋和愉快。我回国后，一定向印度人民作一种公平的、无偏见的叙述，让印度人民知道你们的真实的情况，并将在促进印度和苏联、中国——和平阵营建立密切关系上尽我最大的努力。”    （王鸿）（附图片）
