Secretary General of the International Trade Promotion Committee Xiang Bolan

The International Economic Conference was held in Moscow from April 3rd to 12th. Four hundred and seventy delegates from forty-nine countries and about fifty experts participated in the conference. More than half of the participants were entrepreneurs, industrialists, businessmen, and bankers; the rest were economists, technicians, trade union workers, cooperative business workers, and representatives from the agricultural sector. This conference was not a meeting of government representatives, but a private meeting aimed at exploring the possibilities of improving the living conditions of people in various countries through international economic cooperation and the development of trade between countries.

From its organizational composition, the seriousness of its work, and the conclusions it reached, the Moscow Economic Conference was a great achievement. We can say without exaggeration that this conference was a major international event, and those who yesterday tried to distort the nature of this conference to weaken its importance are now forced to change some of their attitudes.

Why did the Moscow Conference bring together people representing such different interests and such different economic systems? Because the economic situation of several countries, especially Western countries, has reached a point where it is necessary to find solutions due to the shrinking of foreign trade.

It is a well-known fact that the current volume of world trade is only slightly higher than in 1928, but if we consider the increase in the world's population over the past twenty-five years, then the per capita trade volume in several countries has fallen compared to 1928. This situation is not due to the reduction of goods available for exchange, but due to the artificial obstacles erected by the governments of several countries in the path of trade between countries. In many countries, the shrinkage of foreign trade or the geographical restriction of foreign trade has caused serious economic difficulties. Industry is paralyzed due to the lack of markets, and must reduce production, sometimes stop work, thereby throwing workers and their families into poverty. Several countries have attempted to solve the balance of payments by reducing imports, which has actually led to a decline in people's living standards, rising prices, and unemployment. Trade barriers between countries also make it difficult for economically backward countries to obtain the equipment necessary for industrialization.

One of the achievements of the Moscow Conference was to clearly point out that there are realistic and immediately feasible possibilities for greatly increasing the level of international trade. The participants of the conference checked the export possibilities and import needs of their respective countries with each other, and it became clear that there are objective conditions for developing trade between countries (in some cases, restoring trade between countries).

In this regard, the importance of the speeches made by the representatives of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, various People's Democratic countries, and the German Democratic Republic at the Moscow Conference should be mentioned. According to these speeches, these countries are prepared to increase the trade volume with countries whose economic systems are based on private operation to 27 billion to 35 billion rubles per year in the next two to three years.

The Chinese representatives and the representatives of Eastern European countries emphasized that their possibility of greatly strengthening trade with Western countries is proportional to the continuous expansion of commerce between them and the development of their business relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. These representatives also pointed out that their system of concluding trade agreements has no payment difficulties.

From the speeches of representatives from Western European countries, the United States, Canada, Latin American countries, India, Iran, Japan, and other countries, we can see that these countries also have great possibilities for international trade. Even many economic sectors, especially the business sector, in these countries are indeed willing to restore and develop business with People's China, the Soviet Union, and various People's Democratic countries. The trade agreements worth hundreds of millions of US dollars reached during the Moscow Conference, as well as the ongoing business negotiations, confirm the possibility of trade between countries.

These facts also indicate that the differences in economic systems and social systems do not constitute obstacles to trade between countries. The only obstacle at present is the artificial barriers erected to prevent trade between all countries. Blockades, discrimination, and all non-economic means are the real reasons for the reduction in the volume of trade between countries.

Therefore, all participants of the Moscow Economic Conference unanimously decided to write to the United Nations, requesting it to promptly convene an international trade conference with the participation of representatives from the business community, trade unions, and social organizations from all over the world. This approach would allow representatives from non-UN member states that are of great economic importance, especially the People's Republic of China, to participate in the discussion. Without the participation of New China (China alone accounts for a quarter of the world's population), discussions on international trade cannot obtain practical content. One of the reasons for the success of the Moscow Conference was that it brought together representatives from all countries without discrimination.

For centuries, China has played an important role in international trade. Its trade with Western European countries has been going on for a long time, especially with Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany. China's business relations with the United States, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries are also very active. China traditionally imports a large number of machines, metal products, and daily necessities from these countries, and exchanges them for a large number of agricultural products, meat, and eggs.

China used to be an important market for Western countries. If the blockade and discrimination measures taken by the United States against People's China had not resulted in the almost complete suspension of business relations between China and Western countries, then China could still be an important market for Western countries now.

Under these circumstances, the question is whether it should be understood that the restoration and development of trade between China and Western countries is possible and whether it is a gratifying thing. Who is harmed by the blockade imposed on China?

In the past two years, the People's Republic of China has made significant progress in its economy. Land reform and the construction of water conservancy projects have enabled China's agricultural production to recover rapidly, and harvests have increased. In 1951, cotton production increased by 40.7 percent compared to 1950. During the same period, vegetable oil increased by 27 percent, tobacco by 340 percent, and hemp by 98 percent. What is even more surprising is that China, which had always imported rice until liberation, is now exporting 500,000 tons of rice to India. The development of agricultural production, the increase in the purchasing power of the 400 million rural population, and the increasing needs in agriculture have affected industrial production, which is developing rapidly. State-owned and private industrial and commercial enterprises are developing simultaneously with the rapid improvement of the lives of urban workers. For example, in 1951, wages in Northeast China had increased by 160 percent compared to March 1948, and unemployment has virtually been eliminated.

The rampant inflation under the rule of the Kuomintang has been overcome, and price stability has become a new phenomenon in China's economy. In one year, the US dollar fell from 42,000 yuan to 22,800 yuan. Strict steps have been taken to deal with corruption and waste, and the people across the country have supported them.

After I arrived in China, I had several conversations with leaders in China's economic sector, which convinced me that the discriminatory measures taken against the People's Republic of China, even if they increase some difficulties in certain small sectors of China's economic life in the short term, cannot change the direction of China's economic development. China's trade is in surplus, and the volume of foreign trade has increased unprecedentedly. The great development of economic relations between China and the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries can explain this point. The economic relations between China and these countries are based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

In the past few years, the economic situation of Western European countries, Latin American countries, Southeast Asian countries, Japan, etc., has become dangerously serious; the United States cannot escape these difficulties either. Rearmament has thrown the economies of many countries into extreme chaos. Inflation, rising prices, unemployment, reduced work, a decline in the living standards of a large proportion of the people, dollar panic... These are the general situations in Western countries today.

One of the main reasons for these difficulties is the reduction in the volume of trade between these countries and Eastern European countries and China. The figures provided by the representatives of Western countries at the Moscow Conference clearly showed this, which also explains why the desire of many entrepreneurs in Western countries to restore and develop trade with other countries is becoming increasingly urgent.

During the Moscow Conference, trade agreements reached between China and Western countries amounted to 224 million US dollars. Considering that the attendees of the Moscow Conference did not represent all sectors of the economy, this is a large number.

The Chinese delegation, its importance and its quality, made a deep impression at the Moscow Conference. It showed that if China can import the goods necessary for its industry and people, and if the artificial barriers that harm business between countries are eliminated, then China is prepared to conduct a trade volume of 6 to 9 billion rubles per year with Western countries in the next three years, in addition to trading with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This number is equal to three times the highest number of China's past trade with Western countries.

The industrialization carried out by the People's Government will not only not reduce China's foreign trade volume in the coming years, but will instead become a new and active factor. We should remember that the Soviet Union did not reduce its foreign trade in the process of transforming from a backward country to a highly industrialized country, and its foreign trade still has unlimited possibilities for expansion.

China has 500 million people and is, and will be, a vast market. It is now able to help many Western countries overcome their economic difficulties by restoring normal business relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit.

The Moscow Economic Conference has pointed out all these possibilities. The International Trade Promotion Committee has been established, and the participation of important Chinese figures in the activities of this committee will definitely help restore trade between China and Western countries.

Through these healthy and beneficial business relations for the countries concerned, good relations between countries, on which the prosperity and security of the people of all countries depend, can be established. (Attached picture)

    争取与人民的中国建立良好的经济关系
    国际贸易促进委员会秘书长  香贝朗
    四月三日至十二日，在莫斯科举行了国际经济会议。来自四十九个国家的四百七十位代表及五十位左右的专家参加了这个会议。参加会议者一半以上是企业家、工业家、商业家、银行家、其余是经济学家、技术家、工会工作者、合作事业工作者、农业界的代表。这个会议并不是各国政府代表的会议，而是私人会议，其目的是在以国际经济合作和国与国之间贸易的发展来寻取改善各国人民生活条件的可能性。
    从它的组织成分，从它工作的严肃，从它所达到的结论讲，莫斯科的经济会议都是个很大的成就。我们可以毫不夸张地说，这次会议是件国际大事，而那些昨天还在企图曲解这次会议的性质以削弱这次会议的重要性的人，今日不得不改变一些他们的态度了。
    莫斯科会议为什么集合了代表着如此不同的利益和如此不同的经济制度的人物来开会呢？因为若干国家，尤其是西方国家的经济情况已经到了由于对外贸易萎缩，必须设法解决的地步了。
    目前的世界贸易量比一九二八年仅高了一些，但假如以二十五年以来人类的增加数来说，那末若干国家每人贸易量是比一九二八年下跌了，这是大家所知道的事实。这情况并不由于可作交换的货物比前减少了，而是由于若干国家的政府在各国之间贸易道路上树立了人为的障碍所致。在许多国家，对外贸易的萎缩或对外贸易地理上的限制引起了严重的经济困难。工业由于缺乏市场而瘫痪了，而必须减少生产，有时停工，由此而将劳动者及他们的家属投入穷困中。若干国家企图以减少进口来解决支付平衡，实际上引致了人民生活水准的下降，物价的上涨及失业。国与国之间的贸易障碍也使经济落后国家失去它们获得进行工业化所必需的设备。
    莫斯科会议功绩之一在于显明地指出：大大地提高国际贸易的水平，是有其现实的及即刻能实行的可能性。会议的参加者将各自本国的出口的可能性和进口的需要互相核对，就明显地可以看出，发展各国间贸易（若干情况下，是恢复各国间贸易）是有着客观条件的。
    关于这点，应该提一提中华人民共和国、苏联、各人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国的代表在莫斯科会议上的发言的重要性；根据这些发言，这些国家在今后二三年中，与经济制度基立在私人经营的国家之间的贸易额，准备提高到每年二百七十亿至三百五十亿卢布。
    中国代表和东欧各国的代表强调说他们与西方国家这些大大加强贸易的可能性是与他们之间商业不断的扩大和基立在平等和互利原则上的他们之间的商务关系的发展成正比例的。这些代表们又指出他们订立贸易协定制度，是没有什么支付方面的困难的。
    从西欧国家、美国、加拿大、拉丁美洲各国、印度、伊朗、日本以及其他各国的代表的发言中，我们可以看到：这些国家，也有极大国际贸易的可能性，甚至这些国家中许多经济事业方面，尤其是企业界等方面确实意愿与人民的中国、苏联、各人民民主国家恢复和发展商务的大有人在。莫斯科会议时期中所达成的数字高达好几亿美金贸易协定的，以及尚在进行中的商务谈判，就证实了各国间的贸易是有其可能性的。
    这些事实也指出了，经济制度和社会制度的异同并不构成为各国间贸易上的障碍。目前唯一的障碍却是为了想阻止所有国家之间的贸易而树立的人为壁障。封锁、歧视以及一切非经济的手段才是各国间贸易量减少的真正的原因。
    因此，莫斯科经济会议所有参加者一致决定致书联合国，要求他迅速召集一个国际贸易会议，全世界各国都得有企业界、工会、社会团体的代表参加。这样的方式可使非联合国的会员国而在经济上有极大重要性的国家，特别是中华人民共和国的代表也可以参加讨论。没有新中国的参加（仅中国一国即有全世界人类的四分之一），国际贸易讨论即无法获得实际内容的。莫斯科会议获得成就的原因之一即是毫无歧视地集合了所有国家的代表。
    ×××
    好几世纪以来，中国在国际贸易上是个重要角色。它与西欧国家的贸易为时已很久了，尤其是与英、法、意、比、德之间的贸易。中国与美国、日本以及东南亚各国之间的商务关系也很活跃。中国传统地由这些国家输入大批的机器、金属品、日用品、并换取大批的农业品、肉、蛋品。
    中国过去是西方国家的一个重要的市场，假如美国对人民的中国所采取的封锁和歧视手段其结果没有把中国与西方各国之间的商务关系几乎完全停顿的话，那末中国现在仍能是西方各国的一个重要市场。
    在这样情况之下，问题就在应该明白：中国与西方国家之间恢复和发展贸易是不是可能，是不是件值得庆幸的事呢？加诸于中国的封锁究竟害了谁呢？
    两年中，中华人民共和国在经济上有了显著的进步。土地改革、水利工程的修建使得中国农业生产迅速地恢复了，收获增加了。一九五一年棉花产量比一九五○年增加了百分之四十点七。同一时期，植物油增加百分之二十七，烟草百分之三百四十，麻百分之九十八。尤令人惊异的，即中国直至解放时向来是输入大米的，而现在它却向印度输出五十万吨大米了。农业生产的发展，四亿农村人口购买力的提高，农业上不断增多的各种需要，影响到工业生产上，工业生产迅速地在发展。国营及私营工商业与城市劳动者生活的迅速改善同时向前发展。例如一九五一年东北的工资已比一九四八年三月份增加百分之一百六十，失业实际上已消灭了。
    国民党统治下祸害甚烈的通货膨胀已经克服了，而物价稳定已成为中国经济上一个新气象了。一年中，美元由四万二千元跌至二万二千八百元，对付贪污及浪费已采取严厉的步骤，全国人民都予以支持。
    我到了中国以后，与中国经济方面领导人士谈过几次话，使我确信，对中华人民共和国采取的歧视手段，即使对中国经济生活中某些小部门短时期增加些困难，但不能使中国经济发展方向有所改变。中国贸易是出超了，对外贸易量空前未有地提高了。中国与苏联和各人民民主国家之间的经济关系的极大发展，即可解释此点，中国与这些国家之间的经济关系是以平等互利原则为基础的。
    ×××
    过去几年，西欧国家、拉丁美洲国家、东南亚各国、日本等的经济情形是危险地严重化了；美国也不能免脱这些困难。重新武装使许多国家的经济陷于极度混乱。通货膨胀、物价上涨、失业、工作减少、很大部分的人民生活水平降低、美元恐慌……这些是今日西方国家的一般情形。
    这些困难主要原因之一是这些国家与东欧国家和中国之间贸易额的减少。莫斯科会议上西方国家代表所供给的数字就明显地显示了这点，这也解释了为什么西方国家许多企业家希望与其他各国恢复和发展贸易的愿望越来越迫切。
    莫斯科会议时期，中国与西方国家所达成的贸易协定，其数额为二亿二千四百万美元。莫斯科会议出席人士并不代表经济所有部门，以此而论，那是一个很大的数字了。
    中国代表团，其重要性及其质量在莫斯科会议已产生了很深的印象。它表明中国假如能输入其工业及人民所必需的物品，假如为害各国间的商务的人为壁障得以消除的话，那末中国除与苏联和人民民主国家贸易外，尚准备在今后三年中每年向西方国家进行为数六十至九十亿卢布的贸易量。这个数字就等于中国过去与西方国家之间的贸易最高数字的三倍。
    人民政府所进行的工业化不但在未来的数年中不会减少中国的对外贸易量，而相反的将成为一个新的活跃因素。我们应该记得，苏联在由落后国家转到高度工业化的国家的过程中并没有减少它的对外贸易，它的对外贸易仍有着扩展的无限可能性。
    中国有五亿人民，今天是、将来也是一个广大的市场。它现在已经能够帮助许多西方国家以基于平等互利原则而恢复正常的商业关系来克服这些国家经济上的困难了。
    莫斯科经济会议已经指出这一切的可能性，国际贸易促进委员会已成立了，中国重要人物参加这个委员会的活动对中国与西方国家恢复贸易定将有所帮助。
    通过这些健康和有利于有关国家的商务关系，各国人民的繁荣及安全所系的各国之间良好关系才能得以建立起来。（附图片）
