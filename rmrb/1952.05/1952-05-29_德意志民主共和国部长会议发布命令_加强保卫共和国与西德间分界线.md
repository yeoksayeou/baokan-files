Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 28th: The German News Agency reports that the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a special meeting on May 26 to discuss the situation caused by the Bonn government and Western countries creating incidents on the border of the German Democratic Republic and sending spies, terrorists, and smugglers to infiltrate the German Democratic Republic. Many people, especially those living on the border, have requested the government to take protective measures to defend against enemy agents sabotaging the construction work of the German Democratic Republic and hindering the improvement of the people's living standards.

Eglat, State Secretary of the Premier of the German Democratic Republic, stated at the meeting: "The current political situation requires us to take resolute action. The military 'General Treaty' is the greatest threat to peace and a direct danger to our Republic. The government of the German Democratic Republic has made every effort to seek a peaceful solution to the German question. In the new situation after the signing of the 'General Treaty,' the government of the German Democratic Republic will continue to bravely and resolutely defend peace and strive for a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, with the support of the vast majority of the German people, in line with the fundamental spirit of its policy, until final victory."

Eglat said: "Our Republic is the base and fortress of the German people's struggle, and it is of decisive significance to strengthen it rapidly and comprehensively. Even the imperialists, the deadly enemies of the German people, understand that under the current circumstances, the German Democratic Republic is of great significance to the struggle for peace and a unified Germany. They are doing everything possible to hinder our peaceful construction and the vigorous development of our Republic." Eglat then cited many examples to illustrate that the Bonn government and Western occupying powers frequently carry out provocations, attacks, and sabotage activities in the border area.

After Eglat gave a comprehensive and detailed explanation, the Council of Ministers unanimously passed the following order on taking measures on the border between the German Democratic Republic and the Western occupation zones of Germany: "The Ministry of Security is hereby instructed to immediately take vigorous measures to strengthen the security of the border between the German Democratic Republic and the Western occupation zones to prevent saboteurs, spies, and terrorists from infiltrating the German Democratic Republic again. If an understanding is reached on the issue of holding all-German elections in order to unify Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis, all orders and instructions issued to implement the above-mentioned measures may be revoked."

    德意志民主共和国部长会议发布命令
    加强保卫共和国与西德间分界线
    【新华社二十八日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国部长会议在五月二十六日举行特别会议，讨论因波恩政府和西方国家在德意志民主共和国边境制造事件及派遣间谍、恐怖分子和走私者潜入德意志民主共和国而造成的局势。许多人民，特别是住在边境的人民，纷纷要求政府采取保护措施，以防御敌探破坏德意志民主共和国的建设工作和阻碍人民生活水准的提高。
    德意志民主共和国总理的国务秘书艾格拉特在会上发表声明说：目前政治形势要求我们采取坚决行动。军事性的“一般性条约”是和平的最大威胁，是对我们共和国的直接危害。德意志民主共和国政府曾经竭尽一切努力谋求和平解决德国问题。在“一般性条约”签订之后的新情况下，德意志民主共和国政府仍将本着它的政策的基本精神，在绝大多数德国人民的支持下，勇敢而坚决地为保卫和平，为争取统一、爱好和平和民主的德国而继续斗争，一直到最后胜利。
    艾格拉特说：我们的共和国是德国人民斗争的基地和堡垒，迅速而全面地来加强它是具有决定意义的。连德国人民的死敌帝国主义者也了解：在目前情况下，德意志民主共和国对于争取和平与统一德国的斗争，是有着十分重大的意义的。他们无所不用其极地阻扰我们的和平建设，阻碍我们共和国的蓬勃发展。艾格拉特接着援引了许多事例，说明波恩政府和西方占领国家经常在分界线地区进行挑衅、袭击和破坏活动。
    在艾格拉特作了全面详尽的解释之后，部长会议一致通过了关于在德意志民主共和国和德国西方占领区分界线上采取措施的命令如下：“兹责成保安部立即采取有力措施，以加强保卫德意志民主共和国与西方占领区之间的分界线，防止今后再有破坏分子、间谍和恐怖活动分子潜入德意志民主共和国境内。如果关于举行全德选举以便在民主与和平的基础上统一德国的问题取得谅解，所有为实现上述措施而颁布的命令和指示即可取消。”
