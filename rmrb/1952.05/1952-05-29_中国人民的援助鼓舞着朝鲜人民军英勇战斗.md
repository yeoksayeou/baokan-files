Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Pu:

    "With the aid of the great Chinese people, we have defeated and will continue to defeat the aggression of American imperialism." I often heard officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army say this during my visits to their units.

    During the days of arduous battles, every item donated by the Chinese people to the Korean people brought boundless encouragement and strength to the officers and soldiers of the People's Army. When the People's Army soldiers received the comfort money from the Chinese people, they said: "This is what our Chinese worker and farmer brothers have saved up to donate to us. We must use it in the most meaningful way." Many People's Army soldiers kept the comfort bags, towels, and socks given by the Chinese people as souvenirs. Kim Bong-soon, the battalion commander of a certain unit of the People's Army, was reluctant to use a pen given to him by the Chinese people as a gift of comfort, until he used it to write the battle plan when he accepted the combat mission. He said, "This battle plan of mine was written with a pen given to me by the Chinese people. I will overcome all difficulties to complete this battle plan and repay the Chinese people for their warm assistance." After the battle began, he led his troops over four mountains, each 800 meters high, broke through the four lines of defense held by the Li pseudo-army's Third Division, and cut off the enemy's retreat, creating a favorable situation for the Xueyue Mountain annihilation battle in the Fifth Campaign. At the height of the battle, Kim Min-yi, the labor party branch secretary of the first company of the battalion, called on all the labor party members in the position and said, "Keep in mind the Chinese people's condolences and expectations for us, resolutely block the enemy's back door, and ensure that the fraternal troops smoothly annihilate the enemy!" Squad Leader Bae Deok-gil immediately led his team of warriors to rush towards the fleeing enemy on the highway. After a fierce battle, the battalion annihilated the engineering battalion of the Li pseudo-army's Twelfth Division, seizing twenty-six vehicles, more than three hundred rifles, and a large amount of supplies.

    In many companies of the People's Army, there are red flags donated by the Chinese people. These red flags encouraged the People's Army to fight bravely on the battlefield filled with artillery fire. In a certain battalion of the People's Army, there is a red flag donated by the Anhui Southern Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against American Aggression. The red flag reads: "If the enemy does not surrender, resolutely eliminate them." Li Balong, the labor party branch secretary of a certain company, the most outstanding soldier in the entire battalion, was in charge of this red flag in the battle. In a fierce battle in which the troops resisted the invasion of two thousand enemy troops, Li Balong, who was holding the red flag high, gloriously sacrificed himself. The chairman of the Democratic Youth League of the company immediately stepped forward and raised the red flag high again in the smoke and rain of bullets. The soldiers shouted while shooting at the enemy: "With the powerful Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world behind us, we will surely defeat the American aggressors!" They held high this fluttering red flag, repelled the enemy's many charges, and killed or wounded more than six hundred enemies.

    At the rally of the battalion to welcome the new recruits, Kim Ho-beom, the deputy political battalion commander, raised the bullet-ridden red flag and said to the new soldiers: "Our battalion has received this red flag for its meritorious service in combat. We have fought many victorious battles holding this red flag. You must maintain the honor of the battalion, protect the honor of this red flag, and do what is written on this flag: If the enemy does not surrender, resolutely eliminate them!" All the new soldiers made a heroic oath under this shining red flag: We must eliminate the enemy in battle!

    In a certain unit of the People's Army, I also saw many young People's Army officers write down on their notebooks the sentence "The Korean people will surely win" said by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This sentence was said by Commander-in-Chief Zhu when he met with the Korean People's Delegation to China last year. Zhang Jigun, the captain of the delegation and a hero of the republic, told this sentence to thousands of heroic People's Army officers and soldiers when he returned to the front line in Korea from China to report to various units. Now this sentence has become the most powerful battle slogan among the officers and soldiers of the People's Army. In the most difficult times of combat, the officers and soldiers of the People's Army proudly shouted: "Fight bravely! Victory will surely belong to us!"

    The officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army are filled with infinite gratitude for the brotherly assistance of the Chinese people. In the People's Army units, everywhere you can see the portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, and General Kim Il-sung and Marshal Stalin hanging together, and everywhere you can see slogans thanking the Chinese people for their assistance pasted on trees, rock walls, and houses. From the trenches traversing central Korea to the rolling coastlines, the brave soldiers of the People's Army sing loudly "The East is Red" and "The Battle Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers." A soldier named Kim Kwon-young wrote in a thank you letter to the Chinese people: "The Chinese people helped us in the most difficult time in our country. We must better cooperate with the Volunteers and give the enemy an even heavier blow."

### 中国人民的援助鼓舞着朝鲜人民军英勇战斗

    中国人民的援助鼓舞着朝鲜人民军英勇战斗
    新华社记者　赵普
    “我们有伟大的中国人民的援助，已经打败并且将继续打败美帝国主义的侵略。”我在访问朝鲜人民军部队时经常听到官兵们这样说。
    在艰苦战斗的日子里，中国人民捐献给朝鲜人民的每一件东西，都给人民军官兵带来了无限的鼓舞和力量。人民军战士们在领到中国人民的慰劳金时说：“这是中国工人农民兄弟们节省下来捐赠给我们的，我们必须把它用到最有意义的地方。”许多人民军战士把中国人民赠送的慰劳袋、毛巾和袜子等东西保存起来留作纪念。人民军某部金凤顺大队长平时舍不得用中国人民慰劳的一支钢笔，直到接受战斗任务时才用它写了作战计划。他说：“我这个作战计划是用中国人民赠给的钢笔写出来的，我要克服一切困难来完成这个作战计划，报答中国人民对我们的热情援助。”在战斗发起之后，他率领部队翻越四座八百公尺高的大山，突破了李伪军第三师所据守的四道防线，插到敌后切断了敌人的退路，造成了第五次战役中雪岳山歼灭战的有利形势。在战斗最激烈的时候，该大队第一中队劳动党支部书记金民衣在阵地上号召全中队劳动党员说：“牢牢地记住中国人民对我们的慰问和期望，坚决堵住敌人的后门，保证兄弟部队顺利地歼灭敌人！”裴得吉小队长立即率领全队勇士扑向公路上的溃逃的敌人。经过一阵激战，该大队消灭了李伪军第十二师的工兵营，缴获了二十六辆汽车、三百多支步枪和大批物资。
    在许多人民军的中队里都有中国人民赠送的红旗。这些红旗在炮火连天的战场上鼓舞着人民军勇敢战斗。在人民军某大队里有一面中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会皖南分会所赠送的红旗，红旗上写着：“敌人不投降，就坚决消灭它”。在战斗中掌握这面红旗的是全大队最优秀的战士、某中队劳动党支部书记李八龙。在部队抗击两千敌军进犯的一次激烈战斗中，高举着红旗的李八龙光荣牺牲了，该中队的民主主义青年同盟委员长立即挺身而出，在硝烟弹雨中，把红旗重又高高地举起。战士们一面射击着敌人，一面喊道：“有强大的中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民在我们的后面，我们一定能打败美国侵略军！”他们一直高举着这面飘舞着的红旗，击溃敌人多次冲锋，打死打伤了六百多名敌人。
    在该大队欢迎新参军的战士的大会上，政治副大队长金虎范把这面布满弹孔的红旗高举起来，对新战士讲道：“我们大队因为作战有功得到了这面红旗。我们抗了这面红旗打了很多胜仗。你们要保持大队的荣誉，保护这面红旗的荣誉，要做到这面旗上所写的：敌人不投降，就坚决消灭它！”全体新战士就在这面闪着光辉的红旗下立下英雄的誓愿：我们一定要在战斗中消灭敌人！
    在人民军某部，我还看到许多年青的人民军军官把中国人民解放军朱德总司令所说“朝鲜人民一定能胜利”的一句话记在自己的笔记本上。这句话是朱总司令在去年接见朝鲜人民访华代表团时说的。代表团团员、共和国英雄张济根中队长从中国返回朝鲜前线到各部队去做报告时，把这句话告诉了千千万万英雄的人民军官兵。现在这句话已经成了人民军官兵们中最有力量的战斗口号。在战斗最艰苦的时候，人民军的官兵们就昂然高呼：“勇敢地战斗吧！胜利一定属于我们！”
    朝鲜人民军的官兵们对中国人民兄弟般的援助满怀着无限感激。在人民军的部队里，到处可以看到中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的画像和金日成将军、斯大林大元帅的画像高挂在一起，到处可以看到贴在树上、岩壁上和屋子里的感谢中国人民援助的标语。从横贯朝鲜中部的战壕里到山岭起伏的海岸线上，人民军英勇的战士们高声唱着“东方红”和
    “中国人民志愿军战歌”。一位名叫金权永的战士在寄给中国人民的感谢信上写道：“中国人民在我们祖国最艰难的时候，援助了我们，我们一定要更好地和志愿军协同作战，给敌人以更沉重的打击。”
