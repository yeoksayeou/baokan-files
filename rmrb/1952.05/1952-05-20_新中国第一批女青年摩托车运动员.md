    The First Group of Young Female Motorcycle Athletes in New China
    Motorcycle Sports Correspondence Group
    The first group of young female motorcycle athletes in New China emerged in May of this year. They are all young women around twenty years old, lively, cheerful, healthy, and full of spirit. As they drove their motorcycles in a column through the streets of the capital, people greeted them with envious eyes.
    Motorcycle sports are one of the new sports in our country, and women's participation in this sport is the first time in history. When they learned that they had the opportunity to participate in motorcycle sports, they all felt very excited and happy. In just one month, they learned to ride bicycles on their own training ground, learned some principles of motorcycles, and mastered the driving skills of motorcycles.
    From the beginning, they learned to drive heavy motorcycles weighing more than 400 pounds. At first, individual comrades thought that motorcycles were bulky and difficult to control; therefore, although their enthusiasm for learning was high, their confidence in learning was not high. The instructor, in response to this thinking, explained to them in detail that although motorcycles are relatively heavy, they are flexible machines. If one has the physical strength of an average person, does some exercise, becomes familiar with its performance, and masters the essentials of various main actions and operates carefully, one can drive it well. In this way, they greatly increased their confidence and actively participated in physical exercise. Early in the morning, as the sky was just turning pale, they got up to do mechanical gymnastics: such as doing vaulting box, parallel bars (single bar exercise also greatly helps in learning motorcycle sports), and tumbling to exercise the upper limbs and torso, and learn the skills of leaping. They practiced long jump and running and other track and field sports to exercise the strength of jumping and pedaling. They also often played basketball to train flexible, agile movements and body endurance. In this way, they quickly learned the technology. For example, they can apply the strength of the whole body to the right foot and quickly step on the starting pedal. The problem of the machine being difficult to start, which they thought at first, was easily solved.
    Driving a motorcycle, in addition to having skilled bicycle riding skills, the most important thing is to require flexible limbs, considerable physical strength, composure, courage, and carefulness, and to be able to grasp the center of gravity of the vehicle, otherwise it is difficult to control it. For example, Comrade Liu Dehui, who was in very good physical condition, had her vehicle fall over easily when she first started learning. The instructor discovered that the reason for this phenomenon was that she had not yet mastered the center of gravity well and was not calm enough. He sat behind her on the vehicle she was driving and often reminded her: "Don't be nervous, don't panic, look ahead." And let her practice driving straight lines at a slightly faster speed, so that she could understand how to grasp the center of gravity of the vehicle. Soon, she was able to maneuver freely through the woods.
    After they mastered the basic driving movements, their learning enthusiasm soared to the extreme. When practicing obstacle driving at night, comrades who accidentally fell over got up, brushed the dust off their bodies, and quickly got back on the vehicle to continue driving forward. Individual comrades who were burned by the exhaust pipe did not let the instructor know and continued to practice driving. They often practiced "mental driving" on the vehicles in the dark to become proficient in operating the throttle, using the clutch, and learning turning, circling, low-speed and high-speed sharp turns and other movements.
    Indeed, driving a motorcycle is a complex technique. Operating the throttle, using the clutch, shifting gears, changing lights, advancing the ignition, controlling the choke, braking, and other actions often require close coordination. When they first started learning, they all felt that their hands and feet were not enough and hoped that they had more hands and feet. But they studied and practiced hard and finally overcame all difficulties. Under the sunlight, they were often so tired that they were covered in sweat, and sometimes they even forgot to eat. When Comrade Liu Heli first started learning, her vehicle was particularly prone to stalling. Later, she discovered that the reason for the stalling was that the coordination between the use of the clutch and the operation of the throttle was not good. So she studied and practiced hard, even pondering the operating movements while walking. Now, her vehicle not only no longer stalls, but can also travel smoothly on the rugged paths in the jungle and the complex streets.
    Every athlete cherishes motorcycles very much, because they know that these are the first batch of "Jinggangshan" motorcycles self-made by the workers of the motherland. They are beautiful in form and fast in speed; sturdy and durable are its greatest advantages. During the test drive, this car safely traveled 6,000 li on various different roads. They said: "After we have driven domestically produced motorcycles, we feel more and more the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, the infinite wisdom of the worker brothers, and the happiness of the young people growing up in the Mao Zedong era."
    Everyone knows that motorcycle sports are of great significance for strengthening the people's national defense construction and economic construction. The characteristics of motorcycles are: lightweight, fast, able to travel on ordinary rural paths, and relatively economical. Motorcycles have a great role in the military: when the army is marching or stationed, it can be used as a tool for reconnaissance and communication; at the same time, it is one of the important tools for battlefield reconnaissance, communication, and liaison. Its use in peaceful construction is even greater: we can use it as a light transportation tool for communication, postal delivery, and transportation. For young people's physical exercise, it is a good sport to cultivate people's bravery, wit, tenacity, and decisiveness. Through this sport, people's brain nerves can be strengthened, and young people's excellent qualities of loving the motherland, loving labor, and loving science can be stimulated and cultivated. At the same time, driving and repairing motorcycles is also a science and technology, which can lay a good foundation for driving and repairing cars, tractors, tanks, and various motor vehicles by driving and repairing motorcycles. They are even more aware that actively exercising, learning and mastering modern national defense science and technology is the sacred task of every patriotic youth.
    The emergence of the first group of young female motorcycle athletes is only the beginning of this sport. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation will promote motorcycle sports in a step-by-step manner on the basis of the widespread development of sports.

    新中国第一批女青年摩托车运动员
    摩托车运动通讯组
    新中国第一批女青年摩托车运动员在今年五月间出现了。她们都是二十岁左右的青年，活泼、愉快，身体壮健，精神饱满。当她们驾驶着摩托车，在首都的街道上列队行进时，人们都用羡慕的眼光迎送着她们。
    摩托车运动是我国体育运动的新项目之一，而妇女参加这项运动更是有史以来的第一批，当她们知道自己有机会参加摩托车运动的时候，她们都感到非常兴奋和愉快。在短短的一个月中，她们就在自己开辟的操场上学会了骑自行车，并学习了一些摩托车的原理和掌握了摩托车的驾驶技术。
    她们一开始就学习驾驶四百多斤重的重型摩托车。起初，个别同志认为摩托车很笨重，难于控制；因此她们学习的劲头虽大，但学习信心还不高。教员就针对这种思想，向她们详细说明了摩托车虽然比较重，但因它是一部灵活的机器，如果具有了一般人的体力，稍加锻炼，熟悉了它的性能，能掌握各项主要动作的要领和细心操作，就可以很好地驾驶它。这样，她们便大大地提高了信心，积极参加体力锻炼。大清早，天刚泛着鱼肚白，她们便起来做机械体操：如做跳箱、双杠（单杠运动对学习摩托车运动也有很大的帮助）和滚翻运动来锻炼上肢和躯干，学习腾越的技能。她们练习跳远和赛跑等田径运动，以锻炼弹跳、蹬踏的力量。她们并经常打篮球，训练灵活、敏捷的动作和身体的耐力。这样，她们就很快地学会了技术。比如她们能将全身的力量运用在右脚上，并迅速地踏着起动蹬。初学时认为机器难于开动的问题，便迎刃而解了。
    驾驶摩托车，除了要有熟练的骑自行车的技术之外，最重要的是要求四肢灵活，有相当的体力，要沉着，要胆大心细，能掌握车子的重心，否则就很难控制它。例如身体很好的刘德惠同志初学时，她驾的车子特别爱倒。教员发现了产生这种现象的原因是她还没有很好地掌握重心，不够沉着。他就坐在她驾的车子的后面，经常提醒她：“精神不要紧张，不要着慌，眼睛朝前面瞧。”并让她用稍快的速度多练习直线驾驶，使她领会怎样掌握车子的重心。不久，她便能操纵裕如地穿行在树林中了。
    当她们掌握了驾驶的基本动作之后，学习的情绪便高涨到极点。在夜间练习障碍驾驶时，偶而倒了车的同志，站起来扑扑身上的尘土，又很快地跨上车去，继续向前驶进。个别被排气管烫伤的同志，也不让教员知道，继续练习驾驶。她们在黑夜里常在车子上练习“精神驾驶”，以便熟练操作油门、运用离合器和学习转弯、打圈、低速和高速急转弯等动作。
    的确，驾驶摩托车是一种复杂的技术，操作油门、使用离合器、换挡、变光、提前点火、控制风门、刹车等等动作，经常都要密切配合。她们在初学时，都感到手足不够用，希望自己多生几双手足。但她们苦学苦练，终于克服了一切困难。在太阳光下，她们经常累得满头大汗，有时竟连饭也顾不上吃了。刘和立同志初学时，她驾的车子特别爱灭火，后来她发觉灭火的原因，是使用离合器和操作油门的动作配合得不好。于是她便勤学苦练，连走路时也在捉摸着操作的动作。现在，她驾驶车子不但不再发生灭火现象，而且能够在丛林中崎岖的小道和复杂的街道上平稳地行进了。
    每一个运动员都很爱护摩托车，因为她们知道这是祖国工人自制的第一批“井冈山”号摩托车，形式美观，行驶迅速；坚固、耐用更是它的最大优点。试车时，这种车在各种不同的道路上安全行车六千华里。她们说：“当我们驾过国产的摩托车后，愈感到祖国的伟大、可爱，感到工人兄弟的无穷的智慧，更感到生长在毛泽东时代的青年们的幸福。”
    她们每一个人都知道，摩托车运动对于加强人民的国防建设和经济建设都有很重大的意义。摩托车的特点是：轻便、快捷，能在普通的乡村小道上行驶，而且比较经济。摩托车在军事上有着很大的作用：军队在行军、驻扎的时候，可以用它来作侦察、通讯联络的工具；同时，它又是战地侦察、通讯和联络的重要工具之一。它在和平建设方面的用途，那就更大了：我们可以用它来作通讯、邮递、运输的轻便交通工具。对于青年的体格锻炼来说，它是培养人们的勇敢、机智、刚毅、果断等性格的一项良好的运动，通过这项运动可以健全人们的脑神经，激发和培养青年们热爱祖国、热爱劳动和热爱科学的优良品质。同时，驾驶和修理摩托车又是一项科学技术，可以由驾驶和修理摩托车而打好驾驶和修理汽车、拖拉机、坦克车和各种机动车的良好基础。她们更认识到：积极锻炼身体，学习和掌握现代化的国防科学技术，是每一个爱国青年的神圣任务。
    第一批青年女摩托车运动员的出现，仅是这项运动的开始。中华全国体育总会筹备委员会将在体育运动广泛开展的基础上有步骤地来提倡摩托车运动。
