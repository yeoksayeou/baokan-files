Reader's Letters:

    To the Editorial Department: A woman from Gejia Village, Fifth District, Lin颍 County, Henan Province, fled to the Jieshou area of northern Anhui during the famine of 1942. She was abducted by bad people and sold to Zheng Zhuqing of Zhengtaizi Village, Yangchangzi District, Yingshang County, northern Anhui, as his wife. She is thirty years old this year. Zheng Zhuqing is fifty years old this year and used to be a lackey of the landlord and doesn't work. This woman is very dissatisfied with Zheng Zhuqing and does not want to continue living with him, so she went to the Yangchangzi District People's Government during the first month of the lunar year this year to request a divorce. The responsible comrade of the District People's Government believed that this woman was "bought by the man for 3,000 yuan in counterfeit currency," and therefore did not allow the divorce and treated her with a very stern attitude. We believe that the Yingshang County Yangchangzi District People's Government's handling of this marriage issue is wrong and does not conform to the provisions of the Marriage Law. We suggest that relevant leaders investigate.

    皖北颍上县杨场子区人民政府
    对待婚姻问题的态度是错误的
    编辑同志：河南省临颍县第五区葛家村有个妇女，在一九四二年闹灾荒时，逃荒到皖北界首一带，被坏人拐卖给皖北颍上县杨场子区郑台子村郑竹青为妻。她今年三十岁。郑竹青今年五十岁，过去是地主的狗腿子，平常不劳动。这个妇女对郑竹青很不满意，不愿和他继续生活下去，便在今年农历正月间，到杨场子区人民政府请求离婚。该区人民政府负责同志认为这个妇女是男方“掏三千元伪币买到的”，因此不准离婚，并用很严厉的态度对待她。我们认为，颍上县杨场子区人民政府这样处理婚姻问题是错误的，是不符合于婚姻法的规定的。建议有关领导方面检查。
