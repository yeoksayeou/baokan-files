Workers and Staff Across the Country Write Letters to Chairman Mao, Celebrating "May Day" by Reporting on Production and Work Achievements
    Employees of the China Railway Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Engineering Corps propose three guarantees for railway repair and traffic, striving for a greater victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    Respected Chairman Mao: In the past year, thanks to your wise leadership, the strong support of the people of the whole country, and the cooperation of fraternal units, we have completed the glorious task given to us by the people of the motherland to repair railways and ensure train traffic, and shattered the enemy's arrogant bombing and destruction of the railways.
    The enemy vainly attempted to sever our railway transport line. Starting from the first quarter of this year, they intensified their new bombing conspiracy, adopting concentrated, strict, and continuous destructive bombing. But the enemy's conspiracy, like the previous one, ended in a tragic failure. Our line conditions have been improved to a certain extent compared to before, the speed of the train has also been improved, the quality of the repair is more timely and in line with the standards, and the number of man-made accidents has been reduced, with large quantities of materials being continuously sent to the front line.
    But we are not satisfied with this. In the continuing struggle to smash the enemy's bombing, we must carry out epidemic prevention and anti-bacterial warfare movements, and complete flood control tasks on schedule. We not only have the confidence to completely defeat the enemy, but also have the confidence to overcome floods and all natural disasters.
    On this "May Day" Labor Day, we would like to make the following guarantees to you: (1) Guarantee to strive not to waste a minute of traffic time, and never let the bombing and rainy season affect traffic. (2) Guarantee rapid and timely repairs in line with technical standards, and no accidents of any kind. (3) Strengthen study, master technology, summarize experience in the struggle against the enemy, improve work efficiency, and strive for greater victory! I wish you good health.

    Zhang Deben Group completes production tasks eleven days ahead of schedule in April
    Dear Chairman Mao: In order to welcome the great "May Day" International Labor Day, our group held two production meetings at the end of March to welcome "May Day". The whole group unanimously decided to complete the task five days ahead of schedule and make one hundred K-1 type three-way valves as a gift to welcome "May Day". This was formulated according to our group's technical conditions and equipment capacity.
    But at the beginning of the production in April, the superiors called on us to further and comprehensively launch the competition that combines "tiger" fighting with production. Before "May Day", we must create an unprecedented new climax in this competition. At the mobilization meeting to welcome "May Day", our group actively responded to the call of the trade union and launched a challenge competition to all brother groups in the factory.
    In the process of less than twenty days, our group, with the specific leadership and help of the factory's Party, government, trade union, and Youth League, has undergone further new changes in labor organization, operation process, and operation methods. The past assembly line operation was a competition between one person and another, but now the competition is also launched in each person's different processes. We have further developed the competition on the basis of implementing the Kovalev work method and carrying out the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method. For example, young worker Cui Chenglin is a first-level craftsman. Since using the multi-tool multi-edge cutting method on the basis of the Kovalev work method, the time for turning the emergency brake valve seat (fifth-level workpiece) has been reduced from eight minutes in the past to fifty seconds now, increasing efficiency by 8.6 times. As of April 19, our group has created many new records, greatly breaking through the original plan and completing the full monthly production task for April eleven days ahead of schedule. We have enough confidence and strength to make two hundred K-1 type three-way valves in addition to the task in April, accumulating more than 100 million yuan of wealth for the country. The comrades in our group said that we will use this practical action to welcome "May Day" and smash the bacterial warfare launched by US imperialism. We hereby report to you. With best regards
    All members of the Zhang Deben Group of the Qiqihar Railway Factory Parts Branch
    All Employees of Jinzhou Textile Factory strive for "all-round success" to celebrate "May Day"
    Respected Chairman Mao: The great "May Day" Labor Day is coming. We are welcoming this year's "May Day" Labor Day on the basis of winning the "Three-Anti" movement, by launching a patriotic production competition and striving for "all-round success". In the past year, under your leadership and the leadership of the Party, we have made great achievements. Last year, we completed the annual production task given to us by the state twenty days ahead of schedule, and also successfully completed the task of increasing production and saving 40,000 tons of grain. This is the result of our learning advanced experience, reducing costs, and improving product quality. In the "Three-Anti" struggle, we actively took action and caught more than 30 big and small "tigers". We also won a beautiful victory on the production front. Workers in the cloth workshop learned the "1951 Weaving Work Method" and completed the first quarter's production task thirteen days ahead of schedule. The completion rate of cloth increased from 85% to more than 96%. In the spinning workshop, the average person used to spin 52 cars, but now it has increased to 68 cars. Workers in the drawing frame and roving frame workshop used the Kovalev work method to combine the advantages of 27 people's operating methods and created the "27" operating method. The output and quality have also been greatly improved, increasing from 5.5 Hanks to 5.6 Hanks. The fine spinning workshop has fully promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method, increasing output by 11.6%. The whole factory overfulfilled the production task for the first quarter. With the development of the national economy, the living standards and cultural levels of our workers are also constantly improving.
    Chairman Mao: Although we have the above achievements, we are not satisfied. We have decided to use better results to fight back against the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors and to welcome this year's large-scale patriotic production increase and economy movement.
    All employees of Jinzhou Textile Factory
    Changsha Telecommunications Bureau Huang Ruixi Group has improved three operating methods and eight machine parts in the past year
    Respected Chairman Mao: "May Day" Labor Day is coming again. Since last May, in addition to completing the production tasks given to us by the state, we have also increased production and saved a lot of wealth for the country. This is our gift to welcome this year's "May Day" Labor Day, and it is also our practical action to combat the American aggressors. Now, I would like to report to you on the work achievements of our group in the past year.
    In the anti-corruption struggle, our group's production tasks were undertaken by the remaining seven people, and the others gloriously participated in the "tiger" fighting. Despite this, we have already completed more than 63,900 kilograms of this year's plan to increase production by 200,000 kilograms of rice in the first quarter. We often held meetings to study technology and learn from technicians. In the past year, we have improved three operating methods and improved eight machine parts. I and worker Zhou Keguang studied to add power regulation and filtering equipment to the existing rectifier. Because of the lack of a rectifier that supplies 110 volts of DC power, we used some waste materials to make a vacuum tube rectifier ourselves. The DC power supply is therefore sufficient. This saved the state a total of 400 million yuan. We also used most of the waste materials to make a high-speed telegraph machine worth more than 20 million yuan, named "Increase Production and Economy" No. In terms of safe production, there have also been improvements. None of us have been injured or ill due to poor safety equipment. Due to the establishment of a reasonable recuperation system and a scientific "workshop calendar system", we have maintained the safe operation of the machine parts and created a record of 282 days without responsibility accidents. Production has increased and welfare has also improved. Everyone can enjoy the care of labor insurance, and there is no worry about birth, old age, illness, or death. I cannot express enough my gratitude for the honor and cultivation you and the Party have given me. In the future, I guarantee to unite everyone to create more achievements in production and welcome the arrival of the high tide of national construction.

    All employees of the Baichengzi Station Cargo Department complete the loading task thirteen days ahead of schedule in April
    Dear Chairman Mao: All employees of our Baichengzi Station Cargo Department have improved their class consciousness and exerted their labor enthusiasm in the "Three-Anti" movement, combining "tiger" fighting and production, completing the first quarter's loading task ahead of schedule and exceeding the task by 10%, making the entire station look new. All employees, in order to welcome the "May Day" International Labor Day, used practical actions to oppose the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism, launched a vigorous movement to increase production and save money, and launched a production competition, making the April loading task completed thirteen days ahead of schedule and exceeding 93 cars (15%), saving 15 railcars, and increasing the country's wealth by more than 200 million yuan. In April, the workers in our cargo department reorganized the cargo owner recruitment team, launched extensive cargo owner search activities, mastered the source of goods and cargo flow, maintained close contact with cargo owners by telephone and face-to-face visits, helped cargo owners solve all loading difficulties, mastered the five-day loading plan, and urged cargo owners to load according to the plan. Due to the vigorous recruitment of cargo owners, the internal affairs Zhao Demao team recruited 57 cars of goods in 15 days and created a record of loading 78 cars in one day, making the April loading task completed thirteen days ahead of schedule. In order to have goods that can be loaded in time, we also signed contact contracts with dispatchers and station operations to strengthen contact; at the same time, we also signed contracts with cargo owners, requiring cargo owners to guarantee transportation according to the plan, and the station to guarantee timely car allocation. In terms of technical loading capacity, we learned advanced business work experience and thoroughly implemented the Yang Maolin loading method and the self-new dedicated line supervision and loading and unloading method. The LCL sending team implemented the flag loading method and the cargo planned transportation method. The workers also put forward the slogan of "light and heavy combination, skillful loading and multi-loading, filling any gaps", and the total loading capacity originally stipulated by the bureau was 17 tons, but we increased it to 27.4 tons, up to 30 tons, saving 15 railcars. In order to prevent the failure to unload empty cars and load goods after the goods are recruited, the supply and marketing cooperative workers organized a joint labor mutual aid group, only waiting for the train, not letting the train wait for people, and organized workers to learn from each other and exchange experience in loading and unloading cars, creating a record of unloading 101 cars in one day. The loading time was shortened by 55% compared to the indicators stipulated by the bureau, and the unloading time was shortened by 77% compared to the indicators. In order to further improve work efficiency, the workers launched a red flag competition to ensure that 350 more cars would be loaded by the end of the month, saving 20 railcars, as a gift to the "May Day" International Labor Day.
    All employees of the Northeast Baichengzi Station Cargo Department
    Employees of the State-owned Bijia Mountain Mechanical Farm
    Guarantee that this year's wheat and soybean yields will be 20% higher than those of local farmers
    Respected Chairman Mao: We have actively carried out preparatory work on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, and all three work teams in the farm have been transferred to spring plowing work.
    Since seeing the challenge letters issued by eleven state-owned farms and one PLA farm to state-owned farms across the country published in the People's Daily on April 2, we have launched heated discussions and put forward specific response conditions, and rose up to respond. Now we guarantee to you:
    1. Guarantee to complete the annual production task—producing 4,500 tons of grain, completing the opening of 1,000 hectares of wasteland, and strive to exceed the task. The yield of wheat per hectare should be increased by 33% compared with last year's yield, and 20% higher than the general yield of local farmers; the yield of soybeans per hectare should be increased by 67.3% compared with last year's yield, and 20% higher than the general yield of local farmers, creating a record of 5,000 kilograms of high-yield wheat per hectare, and soybeans per hectare should also produce 5,000 kilograms.
    2. In terms of disaster prevention and resistance, we must play a leading role in the masses. We guarantee to breed 112 hectares of excellent varieties of wheat. Establish medical stations to treat diseases for farmers and farmers' livestock and solve the practical difficulties of nearby farmers.
    3. Give full play to the efficiency of machinery, deep plowing and close planting, ensure uniformity and neatness, no missed plowing, no missed harrowing, no missed sowing, and achieve the best use of the land and the best use of materials. We guarantee a plowing depth of more than 20 cm, 5 million seedlings per hectare of wheat, 300,000 seedlings per hectare of soybeans, master the maturity period, pay attention to harvesting, and reduce field losses. In terms of creating high yields, in addition to applying 15,000 kilograms of base fertilizer per hectare, topdressing will be carried out once during the growing period. Wheat will be disinfected with cold water and lukewarm soup, and then mixed with 666 to prevent insects. The whole farm will focus on applying medicines in areas where insect pests occurred last year, and use scientific production methods to provide demonstrations for farmers.
    With the highest respect
    All employees of the State-owned Bijia Mountain Mechanical Farm
    Employees of the State-owned Red Star Mechanical Farm guarantee to complete the task of increasing grain production by 1,000 tons this year
    Respected Chairman Mao: Under the call of patriotic abundant production, we have successfully completed the preparatory work for spring plowing. All tractors and agricultural machines have been inspected, checked, and test-run, and are considered fully qualified. We have already held a spring plowing mobilization meeting for the whole farm. The meeting conveyed the production guidelines and tasks for 1952 and conducted a grand review of people, horses, and machines. We are fully confident and have the certainty to complete this year's glorious task of producing 4,600 tons of grain, increasing grain production by 1,000 tons, and doubling the land in 1953 and training a full set of cadres. We guarantee that the average yield will exceed that of local farmers by 20%, truly playing the demonstration role of state-owned farms. Under the slogans of "Strive to be a model farm in increasing yield per unit area" and "Successfully complete the spring planting task and smash the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism with practical actions," all farm employees are full of enthusiasm and vigorously launch a patriotic production increase competition movement, and put forward a response to the farms that challenge the country. Although the climate here is colder and the land conditions are worse, we are determined to inherit the excellent traditions of the People's Liberation Army, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, overcome difficulties, transform nature, and make contributions to the people in the construction of the people's motherland! With best regards

    Guarantee to urge capitalists to abide by the Common Program
    Dear Chairman Mao: Our "May Day" Labor Day is coming, and we extend our warmest greetings to you with incomparable excitement! Under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, we workers have exposed the crimes of the asbestos monopoly group headed by "Asbestos King" Zhou Jinting! Our factory's "Five-Anti" movement has achieved great victory. After the victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, a new atmosphere appeared in our factory: the workers' lives have improved, and unity has been strengthened. Everyone is working hard to produce and strive for great victories on the production front.
    Dear Chairman Mao: Let me report a good news to you. Recently, the quality of all the products in our factory has been improved. Our workers worked hard to study technology and made chicken feather paper and high-pressure spiral packing that China currently lacks the most and industry needs the most. The quality is comparable to imported products.
    Dear Chairman Mao: We can have these achievements thanks to the Communist Party and thanks to your leadership. On the eve of "May Day", all the workers in our factory make a guarantee to you, as our gift to you!
    1. We must supervise capitalists anytime and anywhere so that they abide by the Common Program, do a good job in business, and develop production.
    2. Strengthen our study, strive to improve our political, cultural, and technical levels, and wholeheartedly participate in the construction of the motherland.
    3. All the workers in the factory unite together to work hard to study technology, improve the quality of all products, and guarantee the needs of industrial construction. I wish you good health.

　　各地工人职员给毛主席写信  庆祝“五一”报告生产和工作成绩
    中国铁路志愿援朝工程总队职工提出抢修铁路和通车的三项保证，争取抗美援朝更大胜利
    敬爱的毛主席：一年来，由于您的英明领导，全国人民的大力支援及兄弟部队的配合，我们完成了祖国人民给予我们的抢修铁路和保证火车通车的光荣任务，粉碎了敌人对铁路的狂妄轰炸和破坏。
    敌人妄想炸断我们的铁路运输线，从今年第一季度开始，更变本加厉地施展了新的轰炸阴谋，采取集中，严密，连续毁灭性的轰炸。但敌人的这一阴谋又和前次一样，得到了悲惨失败的结果。我们的线路状况较前更得到一定的改进，行车速度亦有所提高，抢修的质量，也更及时而合乎标准，减少了人为的事故，大批物资源源送到前线。
    但我们并不以此为满足，在继续粉碎敌人轰炸的斗争中，我们要开展防疫和反细菌战运动，并按期完成防洪任务。我们不但有信心彻底战胜敌人，而且也有信心战胜洪水和一切自然灾难。
    当此“五一”劳动节日，我们特向您提出保证：（一）保证争取不浪费一分钟的通车时间，绝不因轰炸和雨季影响通车。（二）保证抢修迅速及时，合乎技术标准，不发生任何责任事故。（三）加强学习，熟练技术，总结对敌斗争的经验，提高工作效率，争取更大的胜利！敬祝身体健康

    张德本小组四月份提前十一天完成生产任务
    亲爱的毛主席：我们小组为了迎接伟大的“五一”国际劳动节，在三月末曾接连召开两次迎接“五一”的生产会议，全组一致决定，除提前五天完成任务外，并作出一百台Ｋ一型三通伐，作为迎接“五一”的献礼。这是根据我们小组的技术条件和设备能力制订的。
    但在四月份生产即将开始的时候，上级又号召我们把打“虎”与生产相结合的竞赛，再进一步深入全面地开展起来。在“五一”前要把这个竞赛造成一个空前的新的高潮。在迎接“五一”动员大会上，我们小组积极响应了工会的号召，向全厂各兄弟小组展开了挑战竞赛。
    在不足二十天的过程中，我们小组由于工厂党、政、工及青年团的具体领导和帮助，无论在劳动组织，操作过程，和作业方法上，都有了进一步的新的改变。过去的流水作业是在一个人与一个人之间展开竞赛的，现在则是在每个人的各种不同的工序中也展开了竞赛。我们在贯彻郭瓦廖夫工作法和开展多刀多刃切削法的基础上，又进一步开展了竞赛。如青工崔成林是一级工匠，自从在郭瓦廖夫工作法的基础上，利用了多刀多刃切削法以后，在车急制动伐座时（五级工作物）由过去的八分钟降低到现在的五十秒钟，提高效率八·六倍。截至四月十九日止，我们小组已创造了许多新纪录，大大突破了原订计划，提前十一天完成四月份全月生产任务。我们有足够的信心和力量，四月份里在任务外作出二百台Ｋ一型三通伐，给国家积累财富一亿多元。我们小组同志表示，决以这种实际行动迎接“五一”，粉碎美帝国主义发动的细菌战。我们特在此向您报捷。此致敬礼

    锦州纺织厂全体职工  争取“满堂红”庆祝“五一”
    敬爱的毛主席：伟大的“五一”劳动节到来了。我们是在取得“三反”运动的胜利基础上，以展开爱国生产竞赛，争取“满堂红”来迎接今年的“五一”劳动节的。一年来，在您和党的领导下，我们有很大成就。去年，我们提前二十天完成国家给予我们的全年生产任务，也胜利地完成了增产节约四万吨粮食的任务。这是我们学习了先进经验，降低了成本和提高了产品质量的结果。在“三反”斗争中，我们积极行动起来，捉住了大小“老虎”三十多只。在生产战线上，我们同样也打了漂亮的胜仗。布场工人学习了“一九五一织布工作法”，提前十三天完成第一季度生产任务，完布率由百分之八十五提高到百分之九十六强。摇纱车间过去平均每人摇五十二车，现在提高到六十八车。并条粗纱车间工人用郭瓦廖夫工作法综合了二十七个人操作法的优点，创造了“二七”操作法。产量和质量也大大提高了，由五点五亨司提高到五点六亨司。细纱车间全面推广了郝建秀工作法，提高产量百分之十一点六。全厂超额完成了第一季度生产任务。随着国家经济的发展，我们工人的生活和文化程度也在不断提高。
    毛主席：我们虽有以上的成绩，但并不满足。我们决定以更好的成绩来回击美国侵略者的细菌战，来迎接今年大规模的爱国增产节约运动。
    锦州纺织厂全体职工
    长沙电信局黄瑞熙小组  一年来改进三种操作方法和八种机件
    敬爱的毛主席：“五一”劳动节又到来了。自去年五月到现在，我们除完成国家所给予的生产任务外，还给国家增产节约许多财富。这就是我们迎接今年“五一”劳动节的礼物，也是我们打击美国侵略者的实际行动。现在，我向您报告我们小组一年来的工作成绩。
    在反贪污斗争中，我组生产任务由留下的七人担负，其他的人都光荣地参加了“打虎”战斗。尽管这样，我们却已把今年增产二十万斤大米的计划，在第一季度就完成了六万三千九百多斤。我们经常开会研究技术，向技术人员学习。一年来我们改进了三种操作方法，改进八种机件。我和工人周克光，研究把现用的整流器加装电源调节和滤波设备。因为缺乏一部供给一一○伏特直流电源的整流器，我们就利用一部分废料，自制了一部真空管整流器。直流电源供应因此充足了。这样共给国家节约了四亿元。我们还利用大部分的废料制成了一部价值二千多万元的高速发报机，命名为“增产节约”号。在安全生产方面也是有改进的。我们没有一个人因安全设备不良而发生病伤。由于建立了合理的修养制度和科学的“车间日历制”，我们保持了机件安全运转，创造了二百八十二天无责任事故的纪录。生产提高了，福利也提高了。大家都能享受劳动保险的照顾，不忧生、老、病、死了。我对您和党给予我的光荣和培养是说不尽的。今后我保证团结大家在生产上创造更多的成绩，迎接祖国建设高潮的到来。
