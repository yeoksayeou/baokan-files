Prevent Cotton Aphids and Spider Mites, Strive for a Bumper Cotton Harvest

Cotton aphids are very small in size, with two antennae on their heads and a needle-like mouthpart that pierces the cotton leaves to suck the sap, causing damage. There are two types of cotton aphids: winged aphids and wingless aphids. Wingless aphids reproduce when food is plentiful; winged aphids occur when food is scarce or when they need to lay eggs. They change according to the environment. The image above shows the changing morphology of wingless, winged cotton aphid larvae and adults.

If cotton aphids have already been found on cotton plants, insecticide should be applied immediately for control. Tobacco lime water is an effective and easy-to-make aphid control agent. Where lime is unavailable or expensive, wood ash can be used instead. The mixing method for tobacco lime water is to soak one jin of tobacco leaves in eighty jin of cold water overnight, then filter out the tobacco leaves; then slake one jin of quicklime with water, add it to twenty jin of water, and make lime water, filtering out the residue. When using, mix the tobacco water and lime water together and stir vigorously before use.

After cotton seedlings emerge, cotton aphids begin to migrate to the cotton plants to cause damage. In April and May, their reproduction rate is slow; from mid-June to early July, the reproduction rate is the highest, with a generation reproducing every four to five days; after August, the cotton plants become old and hard, and the reproduction of cotton aphids slows down. Statistics show that cotton aphids can reproduce twenty to thirty generations in a year.

Cotton aphids are one of the main pests of cotton. The damage caused by these insects greatly affects the yield and quality of cotton. Therefore, in order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to do a good job in controlling cotton aphids. After the cotton plants have grown and it is no longer possible to use the dipping method to control cotton aphids, sprayers should be used to spray tobacco lime water, cotton oil soap solution, and rotenone soap solution to control cotton aphids in a timely manner.

When cotton aphids overwinter, most of them lay their eggs at the roots of several plants such as sow thistle, common selfheal, and violet. When the weather warms up in the spring, they hatch into small aphids and continue to parasitize and reproduce on the host plants; after the cotton seedlings emerge, they move to the cotton seedlings to cause damage. This is the situation when cotton aphids are mating and laying eggs on sow thistle.

Cotton seedlings should be treated as early as possible after cotton aphids occur. Early treatment can not only strive for a bumper cotton harvest, but also save on medicine and labor. This is the dipping method, which is to put the medicine water (such as tobacco lime water, etc.) in a basin and place it under the cotton seedlings, and press the seedlings into the basin one by one by hand to dip them. One person can dip more than one mu per day.

Weeds such as sow thistle, common selfheal, violet, and plantain are breeding grounds and parasitic sites for cotton aphids, so removing these weeds by the roots is the best way to eliminate and reduce cotton aphids. This is a scene of the members of the Zhang Mingliang mutual aid group, a model of high yield in Shaanxi Province, digging and studying weeds with aphid eggs. They have already done the work of digging out these weeds before the warm weather this spring.

Of these two cotton plants, the one on the left has undergone cotton aphid control work, so it grows particularly lush; the one on the right has not undergone cotton aphid control work, so the cotton plant does not grow well.

In order to avoid spider mite damage, prevention must be done early. The most effective prevention method is to use lime sulfur water. Lime sulfur water preparation method: Slake one jin of quicklime, add ten jin of water to make lime water, boil in an iron pot, then add one jin of sulfur powder, boil for one hour, pay attention to adding water at any time during boiling to maintain a certain amount of water, and stir constantly. When it turns tea-brown, filter out the residue to become the mother liquor, add one hundred jin of water per jin of mother liquor, stir well, and it can be used.

Spider mites live on the back of the leaves, sucking nutrients and laying eggs. This is a cotton leaf that has been damaged by spider mites, withered and turned red, and leaves fall off severely.

Spider mites are also very harmful to cotton. This pest is very small in body, red in color, and sucks the leaves of cotton, soybeans, eggplant, melons and other crops. It can reproduce ten to twenty generations in a year.

The damage caused by cotton aphids affects the yield and quality of cotton. The cotton plant on the left has been treated, with many cotton bolls and soft lint; the cotton plant on the right has not been treated, with only a few scattered cotton bolls, and many frost flowers and tight lint.

This is a scene of using artificially made paste water to control spider mites.

Spraying paste water is also very effective in controlling spider mites, as it can stick them, causing them to suffocate and die. Paste water preparation method: Add eight jin of water to one jin of flour and cook into a paste; when using, add another eight jin of water per jin of paste and mix into paste water, and it can be used.

    防治棉蚜虫和红蜘蛛  争取棉花丰产
    棉蚜虫体形很小，头部有两个触角，口器尖如针，刺到棉叶里吸取汁液，使棉叶受害。棉蚜虫有翅蚜和无翅蚜两种：在食料充足时，就繁殖无翅蚜；因食料缺乏或需要产卵时，就发生有翅蚜，它是随着环境的不同而变化的。上图是无翅、有翅棉蚜幼虫和成虫的变化形态。
    如果在棉株上已经发现了棉蚜虫，应立即用药剂进行防治。烟草石灰水是一种有效而且容易办到的治蚜药剂。没有石灰或石灰很贵的地方，可用草木灰代替。烟草石灰水的配合方法是把一斤烟叶在八十斤冷水中泡一昼夜，滤去烟叶；再把生石灰一斤用水化开，加在二十斤水中，调成石灰水，滤去滓质。用时将烟草水和石灰水混合在一起，用力搅拌，即可使用。
    棉苗出土后，棉蚜虫就开始移居到棉株上为害。在四、五月时，它的繁殖力较慢；六月中旬至七月上旬，繁殖力最高，四、五天就能繁殖一代；八月以后棉株老硬，棉蚜虫的繁殖也就慢了。据统计棉蚜虫一年内可繁殖二十代到三十代。
    烟草水治蚜配合量比较表。
    棉蚜虫是棉花的主要虫害之一。由于这种虫类的为害，大大地影响了棉花的产量和质量。因此，为了要争取棉花丰收，就必须动员群众全力做好棉蚜虫的防治工作。棉株长大后，在不能使用浸沾办法来除治棉蚜虫时，即应利用喷雾器来喷射烟草石灰水、棉油皂液和鱼藤皂液等药水，及时地除治棉蚜虫。
    棉蚜虫过冬时，大部分产卵在苦蕒菜、夏至草、紫花地丁等几种植物的根部。等到来春天气暖和后，孵化为小蚜虫，仍在所寄居的植物上寄生繁殖；等到棉苗出土后，就迁到棉苗上为害。这是棉蚜在苦蕒菜上交配及下卵时的情形。
    棉苗发生棉蚜虫后，应及早除治。早治不但能争取棉花丰收，而且省药省工。这是浸沾法，就是用盆子盛上药水（如烟草石灰水等），放在棉苗下，用手把苗压入盆中，一棵棵沾。一个人每天可以沾一亩多。
    苦蕒菜、夏至草、紫花地丁和车前等杂草是繁殖和寄生棉蚜虫的窠穴，所以连根挖除这些杂草，是消灭和减少棉蚜虫的最好办法。这是陕西省丰产模范张明亮互助组的组员们在挖掘和研究产有蚜卵杂草时的情形。他们在今年春暖前已做好掘除这些杂草的工作。
    在这两株棉花中，左面一株是经过棉蚜虫防治工作的，所以长得特别茂盛；右面一株是没有经过棉蚜虫防治工作的，因此棉株就长得不好。
    为了避免红蜘蛛的为害，必须及早预防。用石灰硫磺水防治是最有效的一种预防方法。石灰硫磺水调制法：用生石灰一斤化开，加水十斤调成石灰水，用铁锅煮沸，再把硫磺粉一斤加入，熬煮一小时，注意在熬煮时随时加水，保持一定的水份，并不断搅拌。待呈茶褐色时，滤去渣子即成为药母子，每斤药母子加水一百斤，搅匀即可应用。
    红蜘蛛栖居在叶片的背面，吸食养料和产卵。这是被红蜘蛛为害过的棉叶，枯萎变红，厉害时要落叶。
    红蜘蛛对于棉花的害处也是很大的。这种害虫的身体很小、色红，吸食棉、荳、茄、瓜等作物的叶子，一年内可以繁殖十代到二十代。
    棉蚜虫的为害，影响了棉花的产量和品质。左面一株棉株是经过防治的，棉桃既多，花絮松软；右面一株棉株是没有经过防治的，只零零落落结了几个棉桃，而且霜后花多，花絮又很紧。
    这是用人工方法制成的浆糊水进行除治红蜘蛛时的情形。
    喷撒浆糊水除治红蜘蛛的效力也很好，能把它粘住，干窒而死。浆糊水的配制法：面粉一斤，加水八斤，煮成面糊；用时每斤面糊再加水八斤，调成浆糊水，即可使用。
