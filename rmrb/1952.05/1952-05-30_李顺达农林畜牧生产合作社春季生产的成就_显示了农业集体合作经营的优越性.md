    Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative's Spring Production Achievements Demonstrate the Superiority of Collective Cooperative Management in Agriculture
    A letter from Chen Jie, Man Hui, Xian Fu, Lai Quan, Ji Lan, Gui Lan, and others, members of the Xigou Village Reading Group in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, reports: The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative has successfully completed spring plowing, sowing, and other spring production tasks. This fact demonstrates the superiority of collective cooperative management in agriculture.
    (1) Unified planning and unified management broke the "one-size-fits-all" method of farming, implemented rational planting, and initially made the best use of the land. The entire cooperative, consisting of 21 households, planted 11 kinds of crops last year. This year, they are planting only five kinds in a planned manner (reducing six kinds of miscellaneous grains that are not suitable for planting) and increasing the planting of Golden Queen corn by 20 mu and hemp by 15 mu. In the past, each household had to plant multiple crops on their land; now, whatever is suitable for a particular piece of land is planted on it. This allows the land's fertility to be used more effectively. Cooperative production has also overcome the previous phenomenon of unbalanced cultivation and fertilization. For example, the land of Shen Angen and other seven households could generally only be cultivated twice in the past, and some land could only be cultivated once; the average fertilization was less than 50 dan, and some land was only fertilized with 10 dan or so. They had 52 collapsed field embankments, which were originally estimated to be impossible to repair this year, which limited the increase in land production. This year, the cooperative specifically processed and fertilized these previously poorly cultivated and fertilized lands, leveling 20 mu of land by raising the low spots and padding the high spots, and repaired all the collapsed embankments. This ensures that every piece of land can increase production.
    (2) Overcoming the difficulty of insufficient economic strength. Members invested 1,176 jin of millet, plus past public accumulation funds and loans from the National Bank, making it possible to buy more fertilizer (a total of 2,165 jin of sesame cakes and mustard seeds, and 100 jin of fertilizer powder). After centralizing the sheep flock, another 2,200 dan of fertilizer were accumulated. This allows the land to receive more fertilizer than in the past. They also added one cow, one donkey, and three large farm tools, overcoming the past difficulties of weak draft animals and insufficient farm tools, enabling production to develop more rapidly.
    (3) Unleashing potential productivity, greatly improving production efficiency. They implemented the principle of distribution according to work, stimulating labor enthusiasm and unleashing potential productivity. They also implemented a scientific division of labor, with equal pay for equal work for men and women, initially achieving the goal of making the best use of talent and greatly improving production efficiency. This spring, 14 laborers were dedicated to planting, and five surplus laborers were extracted to engage in sideline occupations, increasing income by more than 1,000 jin of millet. In terms of agricultural production, labor was divided according to specialties, with dedicated personnel responsible for embankment construction, saving 45 labor days; dedicated personnel responsible for delivering fertilizer, and with unified land management, fertilizer could be applied nearby, saving 52 labor days; the use of new-style walking plows, etc., saved 24 labor days compared to the past. A total of 121 labor days were saved. The saved labor force can then be used to further process the land. In the past, eight women did not work in the fields, and four "semi-laborers" did not work; this spring, they knew that they could get paid for every bit of work they did, and none of them were idle. After implementing the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, the production efficiency of women increased by more than 20%. For example, Lu Guilan, Shen Jilan, Zhang Xuehua, and others increased from five work points to seven to ten work points. As a result, all 24 women in the cooperative completed a total of 295 labor days, accounting for about 30% of the total agricultural labor, ensuring timely sowing.
    (4) Everyone strives to improve technology, forming a mutual teaching and learning movement. Three young people learned how to plow and plant, and five women, apart from still not knowing how to plant, have become "all-rounders" in agriculture. Coupled with the implementation of technical division of labor, "practice makes perfect," and all kinds of farm work are done well. They set up dedicated personnel to soak and mix seeds, and the temperature and dosage are controlled more accurately. The implementation of unified fertilization makes it easier to adjust fertilizers and apply different fertilizers according to the different needs of different crops and different soils. After the implementation of unified management, it also broke the conservative thinking of some people, and new-style farm tools were successfully used on 70% of the land.
    The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative's spring production achievements are unattainable by individual farmers and mutual aid teams. The farmers in Xigou Village say: "Individual households are not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams cannot catch up with agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural production cooperatives are trains, mutual aid teams are cars, and individual households are ox carts." Therefore, of the 50 households in the village, in addition to the 21 households that have already joined the cooperative, the remaining 29 households are clamoring to "buy tickets and get on the train." Ma Haixing said: "Shunda and I have been in mutual aid for more than ten years; but I was blind and didn't see the benefits of production cooperatives, and I was afraid of suffering losses, so I didn't join the cooperative and fell behind. Now the production cooperative has made a spring production summary, which has opened my eyes. Not joining the cooperative would really be a big loss, and I firmly demand to return to the team and 'get on the train'!" Now, this agricultural production cooperative has expanded from 21 households to 26 households. Their agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative was able to be formed smoothly, and quickly showed good results after its establishment, because it had a long-term foundation of mutual aid production and relatively strong leading backbone. They expressed that they would work harder, lay a good foundation, and strive for the entire village to gradually achieve collectivization.
    In spring production, they realized several key experiences:
    1. Economic construction must be closely integrated with political struggle. Their cooperative subscribes to one copy each of the People's Daily, China Youth Daily, Shanxi Daily, and Shanxi Peasants' Daily, as well as four kinds of publications: Current Events Handbook, Propaganda Handbook, North China People, and Shanxi Pictorial, and regularly conducts study in conjunction with production. Therefore, the members' political awareness is increasing day by day, and their production enthusiasm is constantly full. They conscientiously implemented the patriotic pact, and successively checked and revised the patriotic pact twice, so that its content changes and enriches with the changes in production tasks and political struggle tasks, promoting the patriotic production competition and ensuring the realization of the production plan.
    2. Be diligent in inspection and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, on April 20th, an inspection revealed that there was still a shortage of 2,500 dan of fertilizer, 22 embankments had not been built, and tree seeds had not been sown on the forest slopes. Everyone immediately discussed the solutions: signing a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to buy fertilizer; buying tree seeds from the forestry office, and mobilizing male and female members to carry out a shock afforestation campaign; assigning seven people to specialize in embankment construction. Therefore, it ensured the timely completion of the plan.
    3. Must strengthen the backbone role of Communist Party members and Youth League members in the cooperative. The Party members and League members in the cooperative proposed: "Must become models of production, study, and unity." They played their due role in every task, leading all the members of the cooperative forward together. Party member Song Jinshan cultivated four members into activists in his production team; the propagandists in each production team regularly organized reading newspapers and broadcasting, encouraging everyone's production enthusiasm; Zhang Xuehua had achievements in harrowing, and League member Shen Jilan seized this example to publicize it, mobilizing 12 women to participate in agricultural production. The Party members and League members in each production team are the core of uniting everyone in production and study.

    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社春季生产的成就
    显示了农业集体合作经营的优越性
    山西省平顺县西沟村通讯读报组组员陈杰、满会、先富、来全、记兰、贵兰等来信报道：李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社已顺利完成春耕播种和其他春季生产工作，这一事实显示了农业集体合作经营的优越性。
    （一）统一计划、统一经营，打破了“一揽子”的种田方法，实行了合理播种，初步做到了地尽其利。全社二十一户，去年共种作物十一种，今年有计划地只种五种（减少了不宜种植的杂粮六种），增加金皇后玉茭二十亩，大麻十五亩。过去每一家的土地都要种多种作物；现在那块地适宜种什么就种什么。这样就使地力能够更有效地发挥出来。在合作生产中，也克服了过去耕作和施肥不平衡的现象。如申安根等七户的地，往年一般只能耕作两次，有的地只能耕作一次；平均施肥不及五十担，有的地只施十来担。他们有五十二道塌了的地堰，原来估计不可能在今年垒起来，这就限制了土地的增产。今年，社里特别在这些已往耕作和施肥较差的土地上加工加肥，用起高垫低的办法，平整了二十亩地，把塌堰也全部垒起来。这就保证了每块土地都能增产。
    （二）克服了经济力量不足的困难。社员投资小米一千一百七十六斤，加上过去的公积金和国家银行贷款，就有可能多买肥料（共买到麻饼、芥菜子等二千一百六十五斤，肥田粉一百斤）。把羊群集中以后，又多积肥二千二百担。这就使土地比过去得到更多的肥料。他们还增添了牛、驴各一头和大农具三件，克服了过去耕畜弱、农具不足的困难，使生产得以更快地发展。
    （三）发挥了潜在的生产力，生产效率大大提高。他们实行了以按劳分红为主的原则，刺激了劳动积极性，把潜在的生产力发挥了出来。又实行了科学分工，男女同工同酬，初步做到了人尽其才，生产效率大大提高了。今年春天十四个劳动力专门种地，抽出五个剩余劳动力专搞副业，增加了一千多斤小米的收入。在农业生产方面，按特长分工，专人包活垒堰，省工四十五个；专人包送肥料，加以土地统一经营之后可以就近施肥，省工五十二个；使用新式步犁等，比过去省工二十四个。以上共省工一百二十一个。省下的劳动力，就可以更多地进行土地加工。过去有八个妇女不上地，四个“半劳动力”不劳动；今春他们知道参加一分劳动就可以得到一分报酬，一个也没有闲着。实行男女同工同酬的原则以后，妇女的生产效率提高了百分之二十强。如吕贵兰、申记兰、张雪花等，由五分工提高到七分至十分。因此，全社二十四个妇女共做了二百九十五个劳动日，占农业总工数的百分之三十左右，保证了适时播种。
    （四）大家努力提高技术，形成了互教互学运动。三个青年学会了犁地、种地，五个妇女除了还不会种地以外，已成了农业上的“全把式”。加以实行了技术分工，“熟能生巧”，各种农活做得样样好。他们设专人浸种拌种，温度、药量掌握得更为准确。实行了统一施肥，就容易调剂肥料，按不同庄稼、不同土壤的不同的需要，施用不同的肥料。实行了统一经营之后，也打破了某些人的保守思想，顺利地在百分之七十的土地上使用了新式农具。
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社今春的生产成绩，是单干农民和互助组都办不到的。西沟村的农民群众说：“单干户不如互助组，互助组赶不上农业生产合作社。农业生产合作社是火车，互助组是汽车，单干户是牛车。”因此，全村五十户除已经入社的二十一户以外，其余二十九户纷纷要求“买票上车”。马海兴说：“我和顺达过去在一块互助了十来年；可是自己眼不明，看不到生产合作社的好处，怕吃亏，没有入社，掉了队。现在生产合作社作了春季生产总结，可给我把眼擦亮了。不入社真要吃大亏哩，我坚决要求归队‘上火车’！”现在，这个农业生产合作社已由二十一户扩大到二十六户。他们的农林畜牧生产合作社能够顺利组成，而且成立之后很快就显示了很好的成绩，是因为有了长期互助生产的基础，有了比较坚强的领导骨干。他们表示，要更加努力地干下去，打好基础，争取全村逐步达到合作化。
    在春季生产中，他们体会到几点主要的经验：
    一、经济建设必须和政治斗争紧密结合起来。他们社里订有人民日报、中国青年报、山西日报、山西农民报各一份，还有时事手册、宣传手册、华北人民、山西画报四种刊物，经常结合生产进行学习。因此，社员的政治觉悟日益提高，生产热情经常饱满。他们认真地执行了爱国公约，先后检查修订了两次爱国公约，使它的内容随着生产任务和政治斗争任务的变化而变化和充实，推动了爱国生产竞赛，保证了生产计划的实现。
    二、要勤于检查，发现问题及时解决。如四月二十日检查发现还缺肥料二千五百担，二十二道堰没有垒起，林坡还没有播下树籽。大家就立即讨论了解决的办法：和供销合作社订合同买肥料；到林业办事处买树籽，发动男女社员突击造林；分配七个人专门垒堰。因此保证了计划的按时完成。
    三、必须加强共产党员、青年团员在社内的骨干作用。社内的党员、团员提出：“必须成为生产、学习、团结的模范。”他们在每件工作中都起了应有的作用，带领全体社员群众一道前进。党员宋金山在自己的生产小组内培养四个社员成为积极分子；每个生产小组中的宣传员经常组织读报、广播，鼓舞了大家的生产情绪；张雪花耙地有成绩，团员申记兰就抓紧这个事例进行宣传，动员十二个妇女参加了农业生产。每一个生产小组中的党员、团员都是团结大家生产学习的核心。
