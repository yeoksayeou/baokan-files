    State-Run Shuangqiao Tractor School Experimental Farm
    Lan Cun
    The Shuangqiao Experimental Farm of the Tractor School directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government is one of the better-performing state-run mechanized farms in the country. The farm is located in Shuangqiao Town, Tong County, more than 30 miles from Beijing. The total area of the farm is 2,700 mu; excluding buildings, and ditches and roads, the cultivated area is more than 1,940 mu. Since 1950, in order to meet the needs of the Tractor School students' internship, and at the same time to demonstrate to the national state-run farms, the farm began to adopt a diversified management method focusing on cotton and animal husbandry, which laid the foundation for the implementation of the grassland field rotation system this year. At present, 1,800 mu of the farm's land is a cotton-grassland rotation area, and more than 140 mu is a forestry and horticulture area. There are a total of 86 dairy cows, more than 200 pigs, and more than 1,000 chickens. Protective forest belts have been planted around the farm.

    The Shuangqiao Experimental Farm of the Tractor School, under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government and the specific assistance of Soviet agronomy experts, was the first to accept the advanced experience of the Soviet state-run farms. Over the past three years, it has gradually mastered advanced scientific methods in cotton cultivation and animal husbandry, and has made remarkable achievements. In 1951, the farm's cotton achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. On 944 mu of dry land, each mu harvested 296 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 80 percent over the farm's own output in 1950, and 180 percent higher than the average yield of farmers in the surrounding villages. The milk production of dairy cows has also increased from an average of 5,040 pounds per lactation period per head in 1950 to 7,814 pounds. Individual dairy cows with the highest milk production can now produce 46 pounds of milk per day. The daily milk production per cow has increased from 17 pounds in 1950 to 30 pounds.

    The large-scale bumper harvest of cotton is the result of adopting the advanced agricultural technology of "close planting, deep plowing, more fertilizer, and pruning" from the Soviet Union. In 1951, the farm's cotton implemented a close planting method of 4,000 plants per mu (the actual number of plants was 3,600). In 1950, the winter plowing depth reached 20 cm; in 1951, weeding and aphid control were carried out in a timely manner, ensuring that there were no weeds in the fields and eliminating aphids. In terms of fertilization, the principle of rational phased fertilization was mastered, and a large amount of organic fertilizer was applied as base fertilizer, and topdressing was applied three times during the seedling stage, when the cotton plants saw buds, and when the cotton was in full bloom, providing sufficient nutrients for the cotton bolls and avoiding seedling blight and boll and flower drop. In terms of pruning, the principles of adapting to the environment, seizing the opportunity, and controlling the growth of cotton plants were mastered, so as to ensure timely topping and ventilation and light transmission. In terms of business management, a district responsibility system and a bonus system for exceeding quotas were implemented, which improved the sense of responsibility and production enthusiasm of the farm workers. Therefore, the farm's cotton, despite the poor soil quality and spring drought, finally achieved the above-mentioned yield, exceeding the planned yield (250 jin) by 18.4 percent per mu.

    The increase in milk production of dairy cows is also the result of implementing Soviet scientific feeding and management methods. In 1951, under the guidance of Soviet experts, cow sheds with complete sanitary equipment were established, so that dairy cows could grow smoothly in a comfortable environment without reducing milk production due to climate changes or mosquito harassment. In terms of feeding, suitable forage and feed were supplied according to the growth needs and seasonal changes of the dairy cows. The farm pre-made the soon-to-be-ripe corn and soybeans into "green storage" to supply the needs of the cows, which not only overcame the difficulty of forage shortage in winter, but also guaranteed sufficient nutrients, so that the dairy cows could produce sufficient and rich milk in winter. The farm paid attention to epidemic prevention work at all times, so that dairy cows did not suffer from any epidemics throughout the year.

    In the process of development, this farm had to overcome small-scale farmer management thinking and certain bourgeois technical viewpoints. The socialist state-run farm is a brand-new undertaking in our country. Therefore, we must resolutely learn from the Soviet Union in order to run this undertaking well. However, many leading cadres and agricultural technicians of state-run farms did not have a sufficient understanding of the nature of state-run farms in the early stage of construction. They still used old viewpoints and old cultivation methods, and did not actively learn from the Soviet Union or study science and technology. Therefore, the farm also took a detour in the process of construction. When the farm was first established in 1949, under the control of the idea of "farming to produce grain," the farm's leading cadres waited for the harvest after sowing cotton without implementing scientific management. The work of land preparation and rainwater drainage was not done in advance, so that it suffered from floods, which resulted in the cotton yield of only 34 jin per mu that year. In the winter of 1949, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government strengthened its leadership over the farm, proposing to learn from the Soviet Union and implement close planting of cotton; and invited Soviet agronomy experts to introduce the Soviet Union's high cotton yields and cultivation techniques to the farm. However, some leading cadres and technicians of this farm, because of their conservative view of "cotton 300 is accurate" (that is, they believe that 300 jin is the highest yield), doubted the Soviet Union's high record of 1,800 jin of seed cotton per mu, and did not dare to raise the planned yield. Therefore, they could not resolutely adopt the close planting method and other technical measures related to it. In this way, the number of cotton plants in 1950 only increased from 1,500 in 1949 to 2,500. However, after the autumn harvest, the cotton yield exceeded several times that of the previous year's sparse planting, with a harvest of 163 jin per mu. At this time, all the cadres and workers of the farm truly realized the importance of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, last year, they resolutely implemented close planting, and used 30 mu of dry land to conduct experiments on ten different densities of cotton sparse planting and close planting in order to demonstrate to national state-run farms. The experimental results proved that under the specific conditions of this farm, planting 4,500 to 5,500 cotton plants per mu can achieve a yield of more than 380 jin. If the cultivation techniques such as deep plowing, fertilization, and pruning are improved, the yield can be continuously increased. Therefore, this year they confidently proposed a plan of 450 jin of seed cotton per mu of dry land and 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu of paddy field, and launched a bumper harvest challenge competition to national state-run farms and farmers. At the same time, the farm has adopted the advanced Soviet agricultural system - grassland field rotation system as the farm's management policy, and from this year onwards, it will implement a six-year rotation system with cotton as the main crop (dividing the farm's cultivated land into six zones, of which three zones are planted with cotton, and three zones are planted with perennial pasture and green feed crops, and are cultivated in a yearly and zonal cycle). After the implementation of this system, through the interaction of crops and livestock, and the planting of trees, the fertility of the soil can be fundamentally enhanced and the climate environment of the farm can be changed, ensuring that higher yields can be obtained in the future, and a bumper harvest can be achieved every year; at the same time, it has created a good feed base for the development of animal husbandry.

    At the end of last year, the winter training class for cadres of state-run mechanized farms held by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government summarized the experience of close planting and high yield of cotton in the Shuangqiao Experimental Farm of the Tractor School. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government decided to widely promote this experience in national state-run farms.

    国营机耕学校双桥实习农场
    蓝邨
    中央人民政府农业部直属机耕学校双桥实习农场，是全国数十个国营机械农场中成绩较好的一个。场址在通县双桥镇，距北京三十多里。全场总面积为二千七百亩；除房屋建筑和沟渠道路外，耕地面积占一千九百四十多亩。自一九五零年起，为适应机耕学校学员实习的需要，同时为了向全国国营农场示范，农场开始采用了以棉花和畜牧为主的多样性的经营方式，给今年实施牧草大田轮作制打下了基础。目前，全场土地一千八百亩是棉花牧草轮作区，一百四十多亩是林艺区。牲畜共有乳牛八十六头，猪二百余口，鸡一千多只。农场四周种植了防护林带。
    机耕学校双桥实习农场在中央农业部的直接领导和苏联农学专家的具体帮助下，最先接受了苏联国营农场的先进经验。三年来，它在棉花栽培和牧畜饲养方面已逐步掌握了先进的科学方法，因而做出了显著的成绩。一九五一年，农场的棉花得到了大面积的丰产。在九百四十四亩旱地上，每亩收获了籽棉二百九十六斤，比一九五零年农场本身的产量提高了百分之八十，比周围村庄农民的平均产量提高了百分之一百八十。乳牛的产乳量，也由一九五零年平均每头每一泌乳期产乳五千零四十磅提高到七千八百一十四磅。个别产乳量最大的乳牛，每天已能产乳四十六磅。每头牛每日产乳量由一九五零年的十七磅提高到三十磅。
    棉花的大面积丰产，是采用了苏联的“密植、深耕、多肥、整枝”的先进农业技术的结果。一九五一年，农场的棉花，实行每亩四千株的密栽法（实有株数为三千六百株）。在一九五零年，冬耕深度达二十公分；一九五一年，适时地进行中耕除草、灭蚜，做到田间无杂草，并消灭了蚜害。在施肥上，掌握了合理分期施肥的原则，施用大量有机质肥料作基肥，又三次在幼苗期、棉株见蕾和棉花盛开时施用了追肥，供给了棉铃足够的养料，避免了棉花在幼苗期发生的立枯病和落蕾、落花现象。在整枝上，掌握了适应环境，抓紧时机，控制棉株生长的原则，做到适时打顶尖，保证通风透光。在经营管理方面，实行了分区专责制和超额奖励制，提高了农场工人的责任心和生产热情。因此，农场的棉花在土质瘠薄和春季干旱的情况下，终于得到了上述的产量，每亩超过计划产量（二百五十斤）的百分之十八点四。
    乳牛产乳量的提高，也是实行了苏联的科学饲养和管理方法的结果。在一九五一年，在苏联专家的指导下，建立了具备着完善的卫生设备的牛舍，使乳牛在安适的环境中顺利成长，不致因为气候的变化或蚊虻的骚扰而降低产乳量。在饲养上，根据乳牛生长的需要和节季的变化，供给适宜的饲草饲料。农场预先把即将成熟的玉蜀黍、大豆等制成“青贮”，供给牛的需要，不仅克服了冬季饲草缺乏的困难，而且保证了充足的养分，使乳牛在冬季也能出产充足而且浓厚的牛乳。农场随时注意防疫工作，使乳牛在整整一年中没有发生过任何疫病。
    这个农场在发展过程中，曾不能不克服小农经营思想和某些资产阶级的技术观点。社会主义性质的国营农场，在我国是一种全新的事业。因此，必须坚决向苏联学习，才能把这一事业办好。但是，许多国营农场的领导干部和农业技术人员，在建场初期，对国营农场的性质认识不足，他们仍然沿用着旧的观点和旧的耕作方法，而不积极向苏联学习，不研究科学技术。因此，该农场在建场过程中，也曾走过一段弯路。在一九四九年农场刚成立的时候，农场的领导干部在“种地打粮”的思想支配之下，把棉花播种下去以后，就坐等收获，不实施科学管理。事先整地和雨季排水的工作都没有做好，以致遭受了水灾，使这一年的棉花产量低到每亩三十四斤。一九四九年冬，中央农业部加强了对农场的领导，提出要向苏联学习，实行棉花密植；并请苏联农学专家向农场介绍了苏联棉花的高额产量和栽培技术。但这个农场的部分领导干部和技术人员因为有“棉花三百准”（即认为三百斤就算最高的产量）的保守观点，对苏联每亩产籽棉一千八百斤的高纪录表示怀疑，不敢提高计划产量。因此，他们也就不能坚决采用密植法和与它相联系的其他技术措施。这样，一九五零年棉花株数只从一九四九年的一千五百株加密到二千五百株。但秋收后，棉花产量超过上年稀植时的数倍，得到每亩一百六十三斤的收成。这时，农场全体干部和工人才真正认识到学习苏联先进经验的重要性。所以，在去年便坚决实行了密植，并用三十亩旱地作十种不同密度的棉花稀植密植实验，以便向全国各国营农场示范。实验结果证明，在这个农场的具体条件下，每亩植棉四千五百株到五千五百株，可以得到三百八十斤以上的产量。如果再从深耕、施肥、整枝等各方面的耕作技术上加以改进，产量还可以不断提高。因此，今年他们满怀信心地提出了每亩旱地产籽棉四百五十斤，每亩水田产籽棉一千斤的计划，向全国各国营农场和农民进行了丰产挑战竞赛。同时，农场已将苏联的先进农业制度——牧草大田轮作制作为农场的经营方针，从今年起实施以棉花为主的六年轮作制（将全场耕地划分为六区，其中三区种植棉花，三区种植多年生的牧草和青饲料物，逐年逐区循环栽培）。实施这一制度以后，通过农作物和牲畜的相互作用，再加以林木的种植，就可以从根本上增强土壤的肥沃性和改变农场的气候环境，保证今后可以得到更高的产量，作到年年丰收；同时为发展畜牧业造成了良好的饲料基地。
    去年年底，中央农业部所举办的国营机械农场干部冬季训练班，曾总结了机耕学校双桥实习农场棉花密植丰产的经验。中央农业部决定把这个经验在全国各国营农场中普遍推广。
