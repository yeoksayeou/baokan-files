Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 10th, TASS dispatch: The Swedish newspaper "Ny Tid" reports from Ottawa that the United States is planning to expand germ warfare. The report claims that three American experts recently returned from South Korea, passing through Ottawa to the northern regions of Canada. These experts are personnel from the so-called Sixth Field Group of the U.S. Chemical Corps, studying methods for conducting germ warfare. This group is working in the Canadian Arctic region with the permission of the Canadian government. One of these experts declared to reporters from some European newspapers that he and his colleagues had spent four months in the so-called Third Central Field Group, studying methods for conducting germ warfare. The Third Central Field Group is permanently stationed in Korea and directly under the command of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. According to this expert, the Third Field Group stationed in Korea also includes representatives from other field groups working in Alaska, the Sahara Desert, Madagascar, Malaya, Indochina, and other places, researching methods of conducting germ warfare. The purpose of the American experts going to Korea was to study the methods of using bacteriological weapons designed by the Third Field Group. These American experts said that their mission was to study, based on the experience of the Third "Korean" Group, practical methods of conducting germ warfare "in any climatic condition, in any region—from the tropics to the Arctic," "and also to familiarize all field groups of the U.S. Chemical Corps with these methods."
