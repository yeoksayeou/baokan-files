The major factories and mines under the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Industry Department are vigorously cultivating worker cadres newly promoted during the "Three-Anti" Movement. The total number of newly promoted worker cadres in the major factories and mines is more than 1,170. They hold positions such as section chiefs, division chiefs, workshop directors, purchasing agents, and administrators.

To address the difficulty of new cadres being unfamiliar with their work, the factories and mines first established short-term intensive business training classes lasting from one week to ten days. The short-term cadre training classes in Chongqing No. 101 Steel Plant, No. 102 Steel Plant, and Chuandong Qijiang Iron Plant have already trained a large number of newly promoted cadres in rotation. After studying in these intensive classes, these cadres have a preliminary understanding of business knowledge and can perform their duties relatively competently in their new positions. Secondly, the factories and mines also adopted the method of signing teaching contracts, with experienced veteran cadres regularly teaching the new cadres about the business. Before signing the contracts, the No. 611 Cotton Mill held a unity conference for new and veteran cadres, correcting the veteran cadres' mistaken belief that the leadership would only value new cadres and not trust them in the future, and dispelling the new cadres' concerns that the veteran cadres would be unwilling to help them and that they would not be able to do their jobs well. After the departments signed the teaching contracts, they also launched a teaching competition. Using this method, the factory has enabled 50% of the new cadres to quickly become familiar with their work. In addition, some factories also held timely symposiums for new cadres to exchange work experience and methods for overcoming difficulties, which also had a good effect on improving the cadres' work enthusiasm and business abilities.

The factories and mines have also paid attention to solving the difficulties of new cadres having low levels of education and struggling with writing and calculation. Currently, the factories and mines are focusing on promoting the rapid literacy method, first enrolling the newly promoted worker cadres in rapid literacy classes. After studying for 74 hours in the rapid literacy class, the number of characters recognized by the newly promoted worker cadres in the No. 610 Textile Factory has increased from an average of more than 400 to 1,900. The newly promoted worker cadres in the No. 616 Factory also increased their character recognition from an average of 300 to 1,700 after 82 hours of study. The workers participating in the rapid literacy classes are now able to read and write daily receipts and forms.

Under the vigorous cultivation and education of the leadership, the working abilities of the newly promoted worker cadres in the factories and mines have been significantly improved, enabling them to boldly and actively improve their work. The four worker cadres newly promoted to the supply section of the No. 611 Cotton Mill promptly formulated seven new systems, including work rules, cotton inspection rules, and receiving and dispatching rules, which have changed the past procrastination and chaos in the section's work. After workers Huang Rong, Chen Keming, and Xia Jifa were promoted to be warehouse managers of three warehouses in the No. 101 Steel Plant, they inventoried and entered into the accounts the off-book materials that had never been sorted out in the past, separated and stacked the finished products and waste products that had been mixed together, and re-established material storage systems and product inspection systems; the three large warehouses, which used to be like waste dumps, are now in good order.

    西南工业部所属主要厂矿
    培养新提拔的工人干部  帮助他们解决各种困难
    西南军政委员会工业部所属各主要厂矿正大力培养在“三反”运动中新提拔起来的工人干部。各主要厂矿新提拔起来的工人干部总计有一千一百七十多名。他们分别担任着科长、股长、车间主任、采购员、管理员等职务。
    各厂矿为了解决新干部不熟悉业务的困难，首先开办了一星期到十天的短期业务速成班。重庆一零一钢铁厂、一零二钢铁厂、川东綦江铁厂等单位的短期干部速成班，现已轮训了大批新提拔的干部。这些干部经过速成班学习，初步了解了业务知识，到新工作岗位后，就能比较熟悉地进行工作。其次，各厂矿还采用订立教学合同的办法，由熟悉业务的老干部定期教会新干部的业务。六一一纱厂在订立合同前，曾召开新老干部团结大会，纠正了老干部认为领导方面今后只重用新干部而不相信自己的错误看法，并消除了新干部怕老干部不肯帮助自己、怕搞不好业务的顾虑。各部门订出教学合同后，还展开了教学竞赛。该厂采用这种办法已使百分之五十的新干部很快熟悉了业务。此外，有的工厂还及时召开新干部座谈会，交换工作经验和克服困难的办法，对提高干部的工作热情和业务能力，也收到良好效果。
    对于新干部文化程度低、写算吃力等困难，各厂矿也都注意解决。目前各厂矿正在重点推广速成识字法，首先将新提拔的工人干部编入速成识字班学习。六一零纺织厂新提拔的工人干部，在速成识字班学习七十四小时之后，认识的字已由四百多平均提高到一千九百个。六一六厂新提拔的工人干部，经过八十二小时的学习，也由认识三百字平均提高到认识一千七百字。参加速成识字班学习的工人，现在已能看能写日常的单据和表册。
    各厂矿新提拔的工人干部，在领导方面大力培养和教育下，工作能力显著提高，因而就能够大胆积极改进工作。六一一纱厂新提拔到供应科的四个工人干部，及时订出了工作细则、棉花验收规则、收发规则等七种新制度，现已改变了该科过去工作中的拖拉、混乱现象。一零一钢铁厂工人黄融、陈克明、夏吉发被提拔为三个仓库的库长后，将过去从来没清理好的账外物资清点入账，把混在一起的成品和废品分开堆好，并重新订出材料保管制度和产品验收制度；以前像废料堆一样的三个大仓库，现已井然有序。　　　　　（新华社）
