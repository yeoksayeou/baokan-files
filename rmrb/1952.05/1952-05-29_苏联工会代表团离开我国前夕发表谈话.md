Xinhua News Agency, May 28th: The Soviet Trade Union Delegation, which came to China to attend the May Day celebrations, issued the following written statement on the eve of their departure from China:

    Dear friends!

    The Soviet Trade Union Delegation came to China with very happy hearts to participate in the May Day celebrations—the international festival of brotherly solidarity of working people of all countries.

    On May Day, in Beijing, the capital of your country, the Chinese people joyously held a grand parade, demonstrating their achievements in various aspects of construction, their desire for peace, and their boundless love and loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. We will never forget those scenes.

    During our month-long stay in China, we have seen the many achievements made by the Chinese people in the short period since the establishment of the people's regime. Everywhere we saw people working heroically and selflessly for the glory of their motherland and the happiness of the people. Everywhere we received warm hospitality. For us—representatives of a socialist country—this fully demonstrates the historically constructed friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

    The Chinese youth made a particularly deep impression on us. The youth, like the entire Chinese people, feel their own happiness. In their cheerful songs, in their joyous laughter, in their bright eyes looking forward to the future, in their pride in today and their confidence in tomorrow, one can perceive the happiness of the Chinese youth in all of this.

    We, like many other delegations from all countries, have received new proof that makes us even more convinced that the Chinese people long for peace and hate war.

    In the eyes of the multi-ethnic, multi-aged Chinese people, in their actions, we saw hope for peace and hatred for war.

    The Chinese people understand the happiness that freedom brings, they do not want war, they want peace.

    They are working heroically in factories and mines, in the vast fields, and on the construction of canals and irrigation projects, and they are fighting for peace.

    In order to maintain peace, the Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting side by side with their Korean brothers on the Korean soil, giving crushing blows to the American bandits—the enemies of mankind who use the most despicable means of warfare—bacteriological weapons.

    We have seen that the Chinese trade unions play a huge role in the entire construction of the young republic. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it mobilizes workers to fight for the completion and overfulfillment of production plans, vigorously improves working conditions and social insurance, and strives to improve the living conditions of workers. At the same time, the trade union vigorously unites the workers into a unified family and strives for the victory of world peace.

    We, the Soviet people, are wholeheartedly happy for the achievements made by the friendly Chinese people. We believe that the Chinese people, under the leadership of their Communist Party and under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, will victoriously complete all the tasks before them, and will be able to defend the fruits of the people's revolution won in heroic battles.

    We will return to our motherland with an unforgettable impression of the heroic deeds of the Chinese people in consolidating their young republic.

    After returning home, we will tell the Soviet people about the glorious labor of the Chinese people, their hope for peace, and their readiness and hope to be friendly with the people of all countries.

    We will tell the Soviet people about the achievements the Chinese people have made in the construction of the new China, in their love and loyalty to the Communist Party and to Comrade Mao Zedong.

    Finally, we express our brotherly gratitude to the Chinese people for the warm hospitality they gave us during our stay in China, and wish them further success in their glorious labor for building a free and strong new China.

    苏联工会代表团离开我国前夕发表谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】来我国参加五一节观礼的苏联工会代表团，在离开中国前夕，发表书面谈话如下：亲爱的朋友们！
    苏联工会代表团怀着非常愉快的心情，来到中国，参加了五一节——一切国家劳动人民的国际兄弟团结的节日——庆祝典礼。
    在五一节那天，在你们祖国的首都——北京，中国人民欢欣鼓舞地举行了盛大游行，表现出他们在各方面建设中所获得的成就，他们对和平的渴望，他们对中国共产党、人民政府和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的无限热爱与忠诚，我们永远也忘不了那些情景。
    在逗留中国的一个月当中，我们看到了中国人民在人民政权成立以来的短短时期里所取得的许多成就。我们到处都看到：人们为了自己祖国的光荣、为了人民的幸福而进行英勇、忘我的劳动。我们到处都受到热烈的招待。对于我们——社会主义国家的代表来说，这里面充分表现出中苏两国人民的历史筑成的友谊。
    中国青年给了我们特别深刻的印象。青年，像全体中国人民一样，感到了自己的幸福。在他们愉快的歌声中，在他们欢乐的笑声中，在他们瞩望着前程的明亮的眼睛里，在他们对今天的骄傲、对明天的信心里，在这一切当中，人们都可以觉察到中国青年的幸福。
    我们，正像为数很多的一切其他国家的代表团一样，得到了新的证明，使我们更加确信：中国人民渴望和平而仇恨战争。
    我们在多民族的、各种年龄的中国人民的眼睛里，在他们的行动中，看到了对和平的希望和对战争的仇恨。
    中国人民了解自由所带来的幸福，他们不要战争，他们要和平。
    他们正在工厂和矿山里，在辽阔的田野上，在运河和灌溉工程的建设上，英勇地劳动着，他们正在为和平而斗争。
    为了维护和平，中国人民志愿军正在朝鲜国土上和朝鲜兄弟并肩作战，他们正在给美国强盗——使用最卑鄙的战争手段——细菌武器的人类死敌以粉碎性的打击。
    我们看到，在年青的共和国的整个建设中，中国的工会起了巨大的作用。它在中国共产党的领导下动员劳动者为完成和超额完成生产计划而斗争，大力改善劳动条件和社会保险，力求改善职工的居住条件。与此同时，工会并大力把劳动者团结在一个统一的大家庭里，为世界和平的胜利而奋斗。
    我们，苏联人，因为友好的中国人民获得的成就而全身心感到高兴。我们相信，中国人民在自己的共产党的领导下，在毛泽东同志的领导下，将胜利地完成他们面前的一切任务，将能保卫在英勇的战斗中所赢得的人民革命果实。
    我们对中国人民在巩固自己的年青的共和国方面所作出的英雄事迹，获得了永远不能忘怀的印象，我们即将带着这个印象返回我们的祖国。
    回国后，我们将向苏联人民讲述中国人民的光辉劳动、对和平的希望以及他们准备而且希望和各国人民友好相处的情形。
    我们将告诉苏联人民，中国人民在新中国的建设上，在对共产党、对毛泽东同志的热爱和忠诚上所获得的成绩。
    最后，我们向中国人民表示兄弟的谢意，感谢他们在我们逗留中国期间给我们的热烈招待，祝他们在为建设自由强大的新中国所进行的光辉的劳动中获得进一步的成功。
