To the Editor: Mobilizing the masses to eliminate pests is a major task in agricultural production. When Guobao Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, mobilized the masses to eliminate pests, it found that some people had many muddled ideas. Some said, "Pests are present every year, why make such a fuss?" Others held the paralyzed,侥幸 mentality that "a rain will eliminate them all." According to our understanding, wheat aphids have a very strong reproductive capacity, breeding 30 generations a year, with each producing 50 offspring. If allowed to reproduce, it will inevitably reduce crop yields. In response to this situation, the CCP Guobao Village Branch used vivid facts to conduct propaganda and education among the masses. For example, propagandist Ju Zhizhong personally caught various pests from the field for the masses to see and led the masses to observe the wheat fields on the spot. The masses saw with their own eyes that the insect-infested wheat leaves had patches of wheat aphids eating the wheat, and some insects were still spinning webs. The infested wheat was yellow, dry, and about to wither, while the non-infested wheat grew lush and green. Many farmers, seeing this situation, said, "If pests are not eliminated, the wheat's life is in danger. If we want to increase production, we must resolutely eliminate pests." Subsequently, 173 people from the entire village joined the pest elimination team.

After gaining preliminary experience in pest elimination, the CCP Guobao Village Branch held a pest exhibition, displaying pest elimination tools, pest specimen samples, and diagrams of the "three-捆箥箕" (a type of basket) artificial pest elimination method. It also used charts to illustrate the growth cycle, reproduction rate, and harmfulness of various pests. At the same time, it used 快板 (a type of rhythmic storytelling) to perform and used loudspeakers to explain to the masses. Within three days, the number of visitors reached more than ten thousand, thus breaking the paralysis in the masses' thinking.

Now, the masses in the nearby Linqing Village have also adopted the propaganda methods of Guobao Village, mobilizing the masses to capture many pests. We believe that all places with pest infestations can refer to the methods of Guobao Village, mobilize the masses, and fight to eliminate pests and complete production tasks.

    中共壶关县郭堡村支部
    发动群众消灭虫害
    编辑同志：发动群众消灭虫害，是农业生产中的一件大事。山西省壶关县郭堡村在发动群众消灭虫害时，发现部分群众有很多糊涂思想，如有的说：“虫是年年有的，何必大吃一惊。”有的则抱着“下场雨即可消灭净”的麻痹侥幸心理。据我们了解：麦蚜虫繁殖力很强，一年繁殖三十代，一胎能下五十个。如果任其繁殖，势必减低农作物的产量。中共郭堡村支部针对这个情况，采用活生生的事实，对群众进行了宣传教育。如宣传员琚志忠亲自从地里捉回各种各样的害虫给群众看，并带领群众到麦地里实地观察。群众亲眼看到生虫的麦叶上有一片片的麦蚜虫在吃麦，有的虫还在拉丝结网，生虫的小麦又黄又干，就要枯死；而没有生虫的小麦却长得绿油油的。许多农民看见这种情况，纷纷说：“害虫不消灭，小麦命难活，想要多增产，必须坚决消灭虫害。”接着，全村有一百七十三人参加了灭虫队。
    中共郭堡村支部在获得了灭虫初步经验后，又举办害虫展览，把灭虫工具、害虫实物标本和使用三?绑箥箕人工灭虫法图样都拿出来展览，并用图表说明各种害虫的成长期和繁殖率及它的危害性；同时配合快板进行说唱，用广播筒向群众讲解说明。三天内参观的人数即达万余名，这样，打破了群众的麻痹思想。
    现在附近的林清庄的群众也采用了郭堡村的宣传活动办法，发动群众捕捉了许多害虫。我们认为凡是有虫害的地方都可参考郭堡村的办法，把群众发动起来，为消灭虫害完成生产任务而斗争。
