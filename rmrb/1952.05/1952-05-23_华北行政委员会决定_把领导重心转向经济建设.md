    North China Administrative Council Decides to Shift Leadership Focus to Economic Construction
    The North China Administrative Council convened the North China Regional Economic Conference on March 24th, deciding that the leadership focus of the five provinces of North China (Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, Pingyuan, and Suiyuan) and the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin should immediately shift to economic construction centered on industry. All economic departments should rapidly shift their leadership focus to production and business. Apart from continuing the "Three-Anti" movement with a portion of their strength, the majority of their strength should be directed towards economic work. It was also decided to swiftly reorganize institutions, allocate cadres, and streamline financial and economic organizations in order to concentrate efforts on key tasks.
    Currently, the "Three-Anti" movement in North China's factories and enterprises has mainly focused on combating corruption, while the work of combating waste and bureaucracy has not been seriously undertaken. In order to thoroughly and comprehensively carry out the "Three-Anti" movement, each factory must dedicate a period of time to earnestly mobilize the masses and launch a movement against waste and bureaucracy. All forms of waste in capital construction, as well as waste in material supply, product sales, and administrative management, must be seriously exposed and solutions devised to overcome them. Democratic construction work should be carried out on the basis of anti-corruption and anti-waste efforts, and various systems should be established and improved. The task of making up for missed lessons in democratic reform must be thoroughly completed during the "Three-Anti" movement. This work must be carried out with strong leadership, and preparations must be made, both by boldly mobilizing the masses and by exercising strict control. On the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, preparations are underway to launch a large-scale region-wide production competition movement in May and June, ensuring the completion and surpassing of this year's production increase and conservation plan. On the basis of several months of continuous competition, quotas will be implemented, followed by cost management work, in order to complete all preparatory work for economic accounting by the end of this year.
    The conference emphasized that leadership organs at all levels must prepare to transfer a large number of cadres to industrial and other related construction departments. Currently, a batch of cadres should be sent to factories first to help with the "Three-Anti" movement, to understand the situation and learn knowledge, as preparation for participating in industrial management in the future.
    The conference also pointed out that in order to strengthen material exchange and rapidly promote trade work, cotton and local products should be immediately purchased and pre-purchased in rural areas, while daily necessities and fertilizers needed by farmers should be supplied. In cities, the work of processing orders should be rapidly restored, and stockpiled products should be purchased. All materials that are unifiedly distributed and allocated should be collected by various regions on time. In terms of finance, the inventory should be thoroughly cleared, and budget and final accounting systems for provinces and cities should be established and improved.
    The conference believes that North China's economic planning work has not yet been well established and a preliminary foundation must be laid this year. First, institutions must be established and a certain number of cadres must be trained in order to gradually realize a planned economy.

    华北行政委员会决定
    把领导重心转向经济建设
    华北行政委员会在三月二十四日召开华北区经济会议，决定华北五省（山西、河北、察哈尔、平原、绥远）和北京、天津二市的领导重心应马上转向以工业为中心的经济建设；各经济部门应迅速把领导重心转向生产和业务；除以部分力量继续贯彻“三反”运动外，大部分力量应转向经济工作。并决定迅速整顿机构，调配干部，紧缩财政经济机构，以便集中力量于主要的工作。
    目前，华北工厂企业的“三反”运动，主要的是进行了反贪污的工作，而反浪费、反官僚主义的工作还没有认真去作。为了完满地全面地把“三反”运动搞彻底，各厂必须拿出一段时间，认真地发动群众，开展反浪费、反官僚主义运动。对于基本建设中的各种浪费，以及物料供应、产品推销和行政管理上的浪费，都须认真加以揭发，并订出克服办法。在反贪污、反浪费基础上进行民主建设工作，建立和健全各种制度。在“三反”中要彻底完成民主改革的补课工作。进行这一工作，必须要有坚强的领导，并须作好准备工作，一方面要放手发动群众，一方面又要有严格的控制。在“三反”运动的基础上，准备在五、六月份先后展开大规模的全区性的生产竞赛运动，保证完成并超过今年的增产节约计划。在连续几个月的竞赛基础上实行定额，进而实行成本管理工作，以求在今年年底前把经济核算的各项准备工作做好。
    这个会议强调指出，各级领导机关必须准备大批干部调往工业以及其他有关建设工作部门。目前先派一批干部下厂，帮助搞“三反”运动，从中了解情况、学习知识，作为以后参加管理工业的准备。
    会议还指出，为了加强物资交流，迅速推进贸易工作，在农村中要立即收购、预购棉花和土产品，同时供应农民所需要的日用品和肥料。在城市应迅速恢复加工定货的工作，收购积压的产品。凡统一分配调拨的物资，各地应按期提取。在财政方面，应彻底清理家底，并建立和健全省、市财政的预算和决算制度。
    会议认为华北经济计划工作，还没有很好建立起来，必须在今年打下初步基础，首先要建立机构，培养出一定数量的干部，以便逐步实现计划经济。
