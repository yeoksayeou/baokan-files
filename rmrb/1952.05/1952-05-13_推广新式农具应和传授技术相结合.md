    Promoting New Agricultural Tools Should Be Combined with the Transmission of Technology
    Editor: The new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers that farmers in Shanxi Province have long awaited have been manufactured through the efforts of our worker brothers and have been gradually promoted throughout the province. This is truly a great joy. The rural masses greatly love new agricultural tools. Last July, Qiao Hetang, a labor model from Maicang Village, District One, Licheng County, bought a five-inch walking plow. Villagers crowded around to see it, all wanting to try plowing with it. Due to the farmers' love for them, new agricultural tools have sold very well. This year, Maicang Village bought eight walking plows in a single day. The entire district plans to promote twenty-one seven-inch and five-inch walking plows, thirty-one weeding hoes, eleven sprayers, 4,000 jin of fertilizer powder, and more than 9,000 liang of insecticide this year. However, some areas have not promoted technology alongside the promotion of new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers to the countryside. Last year, under the leadership of labor model Wang Jinming, villagers in Xiazhuang Village bought seven walking plows, but because most people didn't know how to use them, they put them aside after trying them out. The situation with using chemical fertilizers was the same. A labor model in Hongjing Village bought fertilizer powder, but because he didn't know how to use it, the results were not significant. As a result, some people think that new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers are not effective. In fact, it's not that the walking plows and fertilizer powder are not good, nor that the masses don't like them, but that the farmers lack the technology to use them. Given that rural areas across the country will be promoting new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers on a large scale this year, I suggest that relevant departments pay attention to this matter and mobilize farmers in all villages and townships to establish technical groups to specifically learn the techniques for using these tools and fertilizers.

### 推广新式农具应和传授技术相结合

    推广新式农具应和传授技术相结合
    编辑同志：很早以前山西省农民就盼望着的新式农具和化学肥料，经过工人老大哥的努力制造，已陆续推广到全省。这真是件大喜事。农村群众对新式农具是非常喜爱的。去年七月，黎城县一区麦仓村劳动模范乔河堂买回一张五吋步犁，全村群众拥来参观，都想耕一下试试。由于农民的热爱，新式农具销路很大，今年麦仓村在一天之内就买了八张步犁。今年全区计划推广七吋、五吋两种步犁二十一张，耘锄三十一张，喷雾器十一架，肥田粉四千斤，杀虫药剂九千多两。但是，有些地区在推广新式农具、化学肥料下乡时，没有同时推广技术下乡。去年霞庄村群众在劳动模范王金名的带动下，买了七张步犁，因为大半的人不会使用，一试之后，就都放在一边了。使用化学肥料的情况也一样。洪井村劳动模范买了肥田粉，因为不会使用，结果收效不大。这样，有些人就认为新式农具、化学肥料不顶事。其实并不是步犁、肥田粉不好，也不是群众不喜爱，而是农民缺乏使用它们的技术。鉴于今年各地农村将要大量推广新式农具和化学肥料，我建议有关部门注意这件事，发动各乡各村农民成立技术小组，专门学习使用这些农具和肥料的技术。
