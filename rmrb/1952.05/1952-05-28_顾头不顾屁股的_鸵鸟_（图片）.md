    The "Ostrich" Who Cares About its Head But Not its Behind
    Made by Wei Qimei
    After the American Air Force prisoners of war, Quinn and Enok, confessed to the US military conducting germ warfare, and the recording of their confessions was broadcast to the world, the American aggressors were frightened and flustered by the irrefutable facts exposed by the confessions. The US Far East Air Force Headquarters even attempted to conceal the facts with the self-deceiving tactic of "refusing to comment," just like the legendary frightened ostrich, thinking that if it buried its head in the sand, no one would see it.

    顾头不顾屁股的“鸵鸟”
    韦启美作
    美国空军战俘奎恩和伊纳克供认美军进行细菌战的消息和供词录音向全世界广播以后，美国侵略者被供词所暴露出来的不可辩驳的事实吓得慌乱不堪。美国远东空军总部甚至妄图以“拒绝评论”的自欺欺人的手段来掩盖事实，就像传说中的受惊的鸵鸟一样，以为把头插进沙里，便谁也看不见它了。
