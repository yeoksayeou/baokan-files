Talking with Bacterial Warfare Prisoner Inak
By Our Special Correspondent Li Wei

It was a very coincidental matter: January 14th was Inak's twenty-seventh birthday, and on this very morning, this American Air Force Lieutenant Navigator, who admitted to personally dropping bacterial bombs, was taken prisoner by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

At approximately 11 PM on the night of January 13, 1952, a B-26 bomber belonging to the invading American Air Force was struck by our ground anti-aircraft fire over Anju, Korea. This aircraft dropped sixteen bombs there but immediately suffered a fatal blow.

There were four American Air Force personnel on this aircraft: Lieutenant Quinn, the pilot; Lieutenant Inak, the navigator; Lieutenant Downes, the short-range bombing officer; and Sergeant Campbell, the mechanic. When the front and middle of the plane were hit, Lieutenant Quinn desperately flew it southeast, intending to escape back to the Gunsan base. However, the plane's speed clearly decreased, and it gradually became shaky and about to crash! Downes and Campbell, who were sitting in the back, hurriedly jumped out of the aircraft, but their parachutes did not open, and both of them were killed. Inak and Quinn also rushed to jump out of the aircraft. In a state of extreme tension, Inak jumped first, desperately pulling his parachute. It only opened when he was only fifty feet from the ground, saving him from death. Quinn jumped out later and also almost died from the fall, injuring his leg upon landing. He and Inak were captured in the northwest and southwest of Sunan, north of Pyongyang.

Before being captured, when Inak discovered that the Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers were surrounding him, he said that he had taken out his pistol, thinking, "Fight it out, be a hero!" Then, he looked around and saw that there were no reporters present, no pictures could be taken, and no reports could be written. What was the point? So, he raised his hands in surrender.

On January 14th, these two survivors were sent as ordinary prisoners to a company headquarters of a certain unit of the Volunteers. After that, they were transferred to higher authorities and finally sent to a prisoner of war camp in a certain place in Korea.

As prisoners, they immediately came into contact with the people's army's policy of leniency towards prisoners of war. They were given brand-new blue cotton uniforms, grass-green cotton overcoats, black cotton shoes, white towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, eating utensils, blankets, quilts, and even decent pipes... He saw the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, saw the suffering Korean people, and increasingly felt that it made no sense to run from distant America to fight this senseless war in Korea. Each of them had a heavy stone in their hearts, pressing down, pressing down, with conscience and guilt constantly struggling.

The internal contradictions manifested as bizarre emotions, and these emotions were detected. On March 22nd, the Volunteer's translation comrades began talking to Inak, like casual chats, intermittently, sometimes talking, sometimes resting. Although the conversation was peaceful, it caused an inescapable heaviness in the heart of a person who had committed an extraordinary crime. Lieutenant Inak sometimes turned red in the face, sometimes hung his head in silence, sometimes looked gloomy, and sometimes was covered in sweat... Realizing that he had participated in an unjust war, and facing the truth, he could not help but bow his head and tell the truth. He finally confessed everything frankly on April 4th. A week later, Quinn also confessed. They had been talking under isolated conditions, and they spoke and wrote their confessions voluntarily. The content of the materials they spoke and wrote had consistency. During this period, they did not see any newspapers publishing news about germ warfare, but the germ warfare content they talked about completely corresponded to the actual situation of the American imperialists' airdropping of germs discovered on the Korean battlefield and within our Northeast China.

On the afternoon of April 14th, I and Comrade Wang Qianqi, the translator (the person who personally interrogated Inak), went to see Inak. When I walked into the courtyard, Inak was pacing leisurely with a pipe in his mouth, and his face was relaxed. We greeted him and went into his room together—a Korean folk house. We all sat on small stools, and then Comrade Wang introduced me to Inak.

The following is our conversation:

I asked, "Are you living well?"

Inak replied, "I am living very well."

Asked, "Are you used to wearing Chinese-style clothes?"

Answered, "I am used to it. It's the first time I've worn such a winter cotton uniform, and I feel very warm."

Asked, "Do you like to eat Chinese-style dishes?"

Answered, "Chinese dishes taste very good. What I especially like are 'jiao—zi.'" He spoke the word "jiaozi" in Chinese.

Asked, "Who is in your family?"

Answered, "Mother, sister, brother, sister-in-law, and a little nephew."

Asked, "Don't you have a lover?"

Inak smiled and took out a photo of a young American girl from his coat pocket and handed it to me.

I said, "Not married?"

Inak: "Not engaged yet. I hope to be able to marry her after I am released."

Then, he talked about his personal experience: He had studied electrical engineering at university for two years. He was drafted into the army in 1943, and during World War II, he had been to Yunnan, China. He arrived in Gunsan, southern Korea, on September 1, 1951. He narrated the circumstances before and after being captured near Sunan.

I asked, "Were you afraid of us after you were captured?"

Answered, "I was afraid at the time. Because I had heard before that the Chinese People's Volunteers would behead prisoners they captured (he gestured with his hand). However, on the contrary, I was treated leniently immediately after being captured."

Asked, "Do you understand why we can treat prisoners leniently?"

Answered, "I think...it's because the general American people are innocent."

I said, "That's certainly true; but more importantly, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army are the people's armies."

He smiled and said, "That's right. If I had been captured by Chiang Kai-shek's army, perhaps the situation would have been completely different."

Asked, "Do you think it makes any sense for the American army to come to Korea to fight?"

Answered, "When I participated in World War II, it was very clear, but coming to Korea to fight was confusing. Now I understand that we have disrupted the peaceful lives of the Korean people."

I deliberately changed the topic and asked, "I heard that you yourself confessed to dropping bacterial bombs, is that right?"

Hearing this sudden question, he was slightly shaken, and then said, "Yes, I dropped bacterial bombs twice, once on January 7th in Huangzhou, and once on January 11th in Zhonghecheng. I am very ashamed...You have probably read the open letter I wrote...I decided to let everyone see this letter."

Asked, "Do you know this is a crime?"

Answered, "I committed a crime against peaceful people...I had no choice. I am a soldier in the American army, and I must follow the orders of my superiors."

I said, "You are an educated person, you should understand that science should benefit mankind; however, the American aggressors are using science to slaughter mankind."

He said, "This is indeed inhumane." He seemed to have nothing more to say, just shaking his head a few times.

I then asked, "Do you think the American people agree with this germ warfare?"

Answered, "I think the American people disagree; but they don't know the real situation."

After that, we turned the topic to other aspects. He said that he was very willing to learn about China and wanted to see Shanghai and Beijing in the future. He is reading a book about the situation in China during the Anti-Japanese War, written by the American journalist Epstein.

At 11 AM on May 1st, I met Inak for the second time, at an office in a prisoner of war camp in northern Korea. He was a little fatter than the last time I saw him, and he was very happy. I asked him how his life had been recently, and how he was feeling. He told me that the Volunteers were very concerned about his life, that he was living well, and that his mood was stable. Regarding all the materials he had confessed about participating in germ warfare, he agreed to have them published in the press.

From his words, it can be seen that he believes that because he can confess and repent, we will not kill him; however, he is worried that the American government will persecute him for doing so. Therefore, he wants the people of all America and the world to know about this, and hopes that the people will support him, because he has told the true experience.

    和细菌战俘伊纳克谈话
    本报特约记者 李伟
    事情是非常凑巧的：一月十四日是伊纳克的二十七周岁生日，就在这一天早晨，这位承认亲自投过细菌弹的美国空军中尉领航员做了中国人民志愿军的俘虏。
    一九五二年一月十三日夜十一时许，在朝鲜安州上空，一架侵朝美国空军所属的B—26型轰炸机被我地面高射炮火击中了。这架飞机在那里投下了十六颗炸弹，但立即遭受了致命的打击。
    在这一架飞机里，有四个美国空军人员：驾驶员奎恩中尉、领航员伊纳克中尉、短航仪轰炸手唐内士中尉、机械师坎拜尔中士。当这架飞机的中前部受伤以后，奎恩中尉驾着它拚命向东南跑，意图逃回群山基地。但是，飞机的飞行速度显然降低了，逐渐摇摇欲坠了！坐在后面的唐内士和坎拜尔慌忙跳出机身，然而，降落伞并没有打开，两个人都摔死了。伊纳克和奎恩也争先恐后地跳出机身，在万分紧张的情况中，伊纳克先跳下来，拚命扯拉他的降落伞，直到离地面仅有五十英尺的时候，伞才张开，得免于死。奎恩后跳下来，也差点儿没摔死，落地后挫伤了腿。在平壤以北顺安的西北和西南，他俩先后被俘了。
    伊纳克在被俘之前，当发现了中国人民志愿军的战士们向他包围而来的时候，他说，他曾掏出手枪，心里想：“拚一下，做个英雄吧！”又环顾四周，这里没有一个记者在场，既不能拍下照片，又不能留下一篇报道，何苦来呢？于是，他举手投降了。
    一月十四日，这两个幸存的人被当做一般的俘虏送到志愿军某部的一个连部。此后，辗转押送到上级机关，最后被送进朝鲜某地俘虏营。
    当了俘虏，他们立即接触到了人民军队宽待俘虏的政策。他们穿上了崭新的蓝色棉衣，草绿色棉大衣，黑色棉鞋，领了白毛巾、牙刷、牙膏和食具、毯子、被子，还领到很体面的烟斗……他看到了中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，看到了受难的朝鲜人民，越发觉得从遥远的美洲跑到朝鲜来打这个糊涂仗是没有意思的。他们的心里各自有一块沉重的石头，压着，压着，良心和罪恶总是在斗争着。
    内在的矛盾表现为离奇的情绪，这种情绪被发觉了。三月二十二日，志愿军的翻译同志开始找伊纳克谈话，像聊天一样，断断续续地，有时谈，有时休息。虽然谈话是平和的，在犯过不平常的罪行的人的心里却引起难以摆脱的沉重感。伊纳克中尉有时涨红了脸，有时垂头不语，有时面色阴郁，有时满头大汗……由于认识到自己参加了非正义的战争，面对着真理，不能不低头，不能不吐出真心话，他终于在四月四日痛痛快快地坦白了。又过了一个星期，奎恩也坦白了。他们俩始终是在隔离的情况下进行谈话的，而且是自愿讲，自愿写下了亲笔口供的，所讲所写材料的内容，却具备着一致性。他们在这期间未见到任何登载有关细菌战消息的新闻纸，但他们所讲的细菌战内容，和朝鲜战场上及我国东北境内所发现的美帝国主义空投细菌的实际完全相符合。
    ××××
    四月十四日下午，我和翻译王乾琪同志（亲自询问伊纳克的人）一道去看伊纳克。当我走进那所院落的时候，伊纳克正衔着烟斗在院子里踱着悠闲的步子，他的面容是舒展的。我们和他打了招呼，一同跨进他的寝室——一所朝鲜民房里。我们都坐在小凳子上，而后由王同志介绍了我和伊纳克。
    以下是我们的谈话：
    我问：“你生活得好吗？”
    伊纳克答：“生活得很好。”
    问：“你习惯穿中国式的衣服吗？”
    答：“习惯了，我是第一次穿这样的过冬棉衣，感到很暖和。”
    问：“你喜欢吃中国式的菜饭吗？”
    答：“中国菜饭味道很好。我特别喜欢的是‘饺——子’。”饺子这个字眼他是用中文讲的。
    问：“你家里有什么人？”
    答：“母亲、妹妹、兄弟、弟妇和一个小侄儿。”
    问：“你没有爱人吗？”
    伊纳克笑着，从上衣袋里掏出一个年轻的美国姑娘的照片，递给我看。
    我说：“没结婚的吗？”
    伊纳克：“还没有订婚。我希望被释放以后能够和她结婚。”
    接着，他谈到他的个人经历：他曾在大学读过两年电机工程，一九四三年被征入伍，二次大战时曾到过中国的云南。一九五一年九月一日到达朝鲜南部的群山。他叙述了在顺安附近被俘前后的情况。
    我问：“你被俘以后怕不怕我们？”
    答：“当时是怕的。因为我以前听说，中国人民志愿军抓住俘虏要砍头（他用手比划着）。但是，相反地，我被俘后即刻受到了宽待。”
    问：“你理解不理解，为什么我们能宽待俘虏呢？”
    答：“我想……这是因为一般美国人民是无罪的。”
    我说：“这一点，确实如此；但不仅如此，更重要的是：中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军是人民的军队。”
    他笑着说：“对了，倘若我做了蒋介石的军队的俘虏，也许情形就完全不一样了。”
    问：“你认为美国军队到朝鲜来打仗有什么意义吗？”
    答：“我参加第二次大战的时候是很明白的，但是到朝鲜来打仗是糊涂的。现在我弄清楚了，我们破坏了朝鲜人民的和平生活。”
    我有意识地转移了话题，问道：“听说，你自己讲出了投过细菌弹的事，是么？”
    他听了这个突然的问话，稍微有点震动，而后说：“是的，我投过两次细菌弹，一次是一月七日在黄州，一次是一月十一日在中和城，我很惭愧……你大概看过了我写的那一封公开信……这封信我是决定让所有的人都看的。”
    问：“你知道这是一桩罪过吗？”
    答：“我对和平人民犯了罪……我没有办法，我是一个美国军队的军人，我必须按我的长官的命令行事。”
    我说：“你是有知识的人，应当懂得：科学应当是造福人类的；但是，美国侵略者却利用科学来屠杀人类。”
    他说：“这的确是不人道的。”他仿佛不好再说什么，只是把头摇了几摇。
    我接着问：“你认为美国人民同意细菌战这件事吗？”
    答：“我想，美国人民是不同意的；但是他们不知道真实情况。”
    此后，我们把话题又转到其他方面去。他讲到很愿意了解中国，很想将来能看看上海、北京。他正在看一本介绍抗日战争时期中国情况的书，这本书是美国记者爱卜斯坦写的。
    五月一日上午十一时，我第二次会见了伊纳克，地点是在朝鲜北部某俘虏营一个办公室里。他比上次我见他的时候又略胖一些了，他很高兴。我问他近来的生活怎样，心情怎样。他向我表示：志愿军对他的生活很关心，他过得很好，心情很平稳。关于他所坦白出的全部有关参加细菌战的材料，他同意向新闻界公布。
    从他的言谈中看出：他相信，由于他能坦白悔过，我们不会杀他；但是，他耽心美国政府因为他这样做会迫害他。因此，他愿意让全美国全世界人民知道这件事，并且希望人民支持他，因为他说出了真实的经历。
    一九五二年五月二日于朝鲜某
