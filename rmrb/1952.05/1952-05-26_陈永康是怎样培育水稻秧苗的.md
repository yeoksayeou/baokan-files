Chen Yongkang's Method of Rice Seedling Cultivation
    Gong Yuesu
    Farmers say, "Good seedlings mean half the rice harvest." Chen Yongkang, a model rice farmer in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, has a very good method from preparing the seedbed to sowing the seeds to transplanting. His seedlings have no blight and are not uneven in height. While the seedlings in the general rice-growing areas of Songjiang County are still sprouting, his seedlings are already two or three inches tall. The seedlings are strong, neat, and have a green color that is pleasing to the eye.

    According to Chen Yongkang's experience, to make the seedlings grow well, the following three tasks must be done well:

    The first task is making seedbeds and sowing seeds. When Chen Yongkang prepares the seedbed, he first turns the red clover under the soil (Chen Yongkang plants red clover in the seedbed, and when spring plowing comes, he turns the red clover under the soil as fertilizer. It should not be buried too shallowly, or the red clover will not decompose thoroughly, and the rice seedlings will easily rot when they grow out). Then he mixes the soil of the seedbed until it is well-rotted, and uses a narrow wooden board to flatten it, making sure there are no uneven places. Each seedbed (that is, the seedbed for sowing rice seedlings) is four feet wide, and a one-foot wide path is left between every two seedbeds. A drainage ditch is dug around the seedbed, and a water-retaining embankment is built outside to easily control the amount of water when irrigating, so that the water slowly flows in. When the seedbed becomes slightly hard and smooth, rice grains can be sparsely sown on the seedbed.

    The second task is carefully managing the water in the seedbed. Chen Yongkang sows with dry rice grains. After sowing, all the water in the seedbed is drained, and the grains are allowed to dry in the sun for a day or two. When he sees small cracks on the seedbed, he waters the rice field the next morning, the water depth just enough to submerge one grain. If the weather is good, after soaking for two days and one night, when the rice grains sprout, water should be irrigated in the morning and drained in the evening. This needs to be done for seven or eight days. After the seedlings grow to more than an inch long, there is no need to change the water day and night. It is enough to keep fresh water in the seedbed at all times. Why should water be irrigated during the day during the seedling stage? Because without water during the day, the base of the seedlings is easily damaged by sunlight. (However, irrigation should not be too much. The water depth on the seedbed should be one or two fen at best. If there is too much water, the seedlings will be completely submerged and cannot be exposed to sunlight, and the leaves will easily rot.) Why should water be drained at night? Because the roots of the seedlings are firmly rooted on the waterless seedbed, they can develop quickly and be strong.

    (Editor's note: The weather in southern Jiangsu is warm, and the temperature difference between day and night is not large, which is suitable for seedling growth, so water is irrigated during the day and drained at night. However, in many areas in the north, the temperature is not very high during the day and even lower at night during the seedling growth period. This requires draining water during the day to increase the temperature of the seedbed; irrigating water at night to maintain the temperature of the field surface to avoid adverse effects on seedling growth due to the cold at night. In some places in the south, the temperature is even higher, and the sunlight is strong during the day, which heats the water and can easily cause seedling blight and damage. When the water temperature is too high, it is also necessary to drain and change the water during the day. In short, the specific methods for managing seedbed water should be determined based on the specific conditions of the local area. Learning Chen Yongkang's spirit of carefully managing seedbed water is very necessary, but it should be noted that it is not necessary to use the specific methods he used under the natural conditions of southern Jiangsu.)

    Managing water is very important in the seven or eight to ten days after sowing. Chen Yongkang said: "Those who are familiar with farming all know that irrigating and draining water day and night is indeed troublesome; lazy people are often unwilling to do this, so the seedlings do not grow well." If you encounter strong winds and rain before and after sowing and seedling emergence, you must strengthen water management. After sowing, if there is heavy rain, Chen Yongkang deepens the seedbed water, submerging all the seedlings or grains in the water; this can protect the seedlings and grains from being damaged or washed away by heavy raindrops, and from being blown crooked or blown away by strong winds. During the recent heavy wind and rain, Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team had just sown seeds a few days ago. They went to the seedbed overnight to irrigate water to deepen it and managed the seedbed well. In this heavy wind and rain, the rice grains sown in the areas of Chengxi and Tiankun in Songjiang County were washed away by 10%, resulting in a great loss. The rice grains of Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team were not only not washed away, but also emerged very well. Deepening the seedbed water during heavy rain is temporary; once the rain stops, the water should be drained to keep the seedbed fresh, without standing water or sewage. When the weather clears after the rain, Chen Yongkang patiently uses his hands to slowly pour the clear water from the seedling ditch onto the seedlings, washing away the mud that was splashed on the seedling leaves during the rain. This mud sticks to the seedling leaves and easily damages the seedlings; washing with clear water is a good way to prevent diseased seedlings.

    The most important thing in managing seedbed water is that there should be no standing water or sewage; fresh water should be maintained at all times. This can not only make the seedlings emerge evenly and develop well, but also prevent seedling blight. In sewage and standing water, there are many germs and they easily grow, which is most likely to cause diseased seedlings; frequent water changes can keep the water fresh, reduce germs, and make it difficult to breed, which can avoid the occurrence of diseased seedlings. Chen Yongkang has mastered this scientific method of water management, so seedling blight has rarely occurred in his seedbed for decades, and the seedlings have grown strong and healthy year after year.

    The third task is topdressing the seedbed. Chen Yongkang is also very particular about topdressing the seedbed. In previous years, he only applied human manure once; this year, due to excessive rain after sowing, the seedlings did not develop quickly, so he changed to applying fertilizer twice. The first time was when the seedlings were about an inch long, and the fertilizer applied was human manure. At 4 pm on May 6, they first drained the water to dewater the seedbed, making the seedbed level with the ditch, and applied human manure; one and a half dan of human manure was applied to an area of 0.7 li of pure seedbed. The best time to apply fertilizer is in the morning or evening. If new human manure is used and there is sediment, the manure residue should be filtered out with an old bamboo basket, and the half-concentrated manure water that flows down should be used. The second time he applied fertilizer was Tianfen fertilizer, which was applied at noon on May 12, six days after the first time. When applying Tianfen fertilizer, the seedlings were already two or three inches long, and there was a thin layer of water on the seedbed, and the dew had dried. The Tianfen fertilizer was applied evenly, which was just right for the fertilizer to work. Tianfen fertilizer cannot be applied in the morning, because the dew has not dried in the morning; Tianfen fertilizer is acidic, and when it encounters the dew on the seedling leaves, it easily damages the seedlings, causing the seedling leaves to turn yellow. About two jin of Tianfen fertilizer can be applied to seedlings that can plant more than two mu of rice fields. After applying Tianfen fertilizer, he also added a thin layer of rice straw ash. This can prevent diseases and also loosen the seedling roots, making it easy to pull when transplanting, and preventing the seedling roots from being broken off. If the seedbed is only fertilized once, it is most suitable to apply fertilizer ten days to half a month before transplanting; if it is fertilized twice, it is best to apply the first time when the seedlings are one inch long, and the second time when the seedlings are two and a half to three inches long. The last fertilization should be about eight to ten days before pulling the seedlings. The reason is: if the fertilizer is applied too late, when the seedlings are just getting fertilized and growing tender, the seedlings are easily broken when pulled; if the fertilizer is applied too early, the seedlings will lose their fertilizer when planted, the seedlings will turn yellow, and they will not grow well when planted in the field. After applying fertilizer, the water cannot be changed immediately. You have to wait until the seedbed has almost absorbed the fertilizer and water before irrigating clear water.

    Chen Yongkang and his mutual aid team have also made improvements over last year in salt water seed selection and other aspects. Six people are assigned to manage three seedbeds, and the seedlings are growing very well.

    陈永康是怎样培育水稻秧苗的
    龚樾苏
    农民说：“秧好半年稻。”苏南松江县水稻丰产模范陈永康从做秧田，落谷（播种），直到插秧移种，都有一套很好的办法。他的秧苗没有瘟病，也没有长短不齐的现象。松江县一般稻区的秧苗还正在发芽的时候，他的秧苗已有二三寸长了。秧苗根根健壮，整整齐齐，叶色绿得使人欢喜。
    照陈永康的经验，要想使秧苗生长得好，需做好以下三桩工作：
    第一桩是做秧板、落谷。陈永康做秧田时，先把红花草翻到地底下（陈永康在秧田上种红花草，春耕时把红花草翻到地下做肥料。翻时不能埋得太浅，浅了红花草烂不透，稻秧长出来就容易烂），然后把秧田的泥捣得烂熟，用狭木板推平，不使有高低不平的地方。每块秧板（即播种稻秧的苗床）宽四尺，每两块秧板中间留一尺宽的人行道，秧田四面开个水沟，外面再筑个挡水埂，便于在灌水时掌握水量，使水徐徐流入。等秧板变得稍硬而平滑的时候，就可以稀播稻谷在秧板上。
    第二桩是认真管理秧田水。陈永康是用干谷播种的。落谷后，把秧田水全部排掉，让谷干晒一两天。他见到秧板上有小缝时，第二天清晨就往稻田里上水，水深正好淹没到一粒谷。如果天气好，浸两天一夜，稻谷抽芽以后，就要清晨灌水、晚上放水。需七八天功夫，一直这样做。等秧苗长到一寸多长以后，就不必日夜换水了，只要在秧田里经常保持清鲜的水就行。为什么出苗时期要白天灌水呢？因为白天没有水，秧脚容易被日光晒坏。（但灌水也不宜太多，秧板上的水深一、二分为最好。水太多了，秧苗全被水淹没，受不到阳光照射，秧叶容易发烂。）为什么要晚上放水呢？因为秧苗在无水的秧板上根扎得稳，可以发育得快，而且粗壮。
    （编者按：苏南天气温暖，日夜温度相差不大，适于秧苗生长，所以白天灌水，晚上放水。但北方很多地区在秧苗生长期间日间温度不很高，夜间温度更低。这就需要白天放水，使秧田温度增高；晚上灌水，以保持田面的温度，以免因夜里太冷对秧苗的生长不利。南方有的地方温度更高，白天日光强烈，把水晒得发热，容易发生瘟秧、坏秧，在水温太高时白天还需要排水、换水。总之，对于管理秧田水的具体方法，各地应看当地的具体条件而定。学习陈永康认真管理秧田水的精神是十分必要的，但应注意，不一定要使用他在苏南的自然条件下所用的具体办法。）
    落谷后七八天到十来天的时间内，管理水的工作非常重要。陈永康说：“熟习种田的人都晓得，日夜放水、灌水，确实麻烦；懒惰的人，往往不肯这样做，所以秧苗长得不好。”在落谷出苗前后，如果遇到大风雨，就更要加强管水工作。落谷后，如遇大雨，陈永康反把秧田水加深，使秧苗或稻谷全部淹没在水里；这样就可以保护秧苗、稻谷，使它们不被大雨点打坏、冲掉，不被大风吹歪、吹掉。最近一次大风雨时，陈永康互助组刚落谷没几天。他们连夜到秧田灌水使之加深，管好秧田。在这次大风雨中，松江县城西、天崑等区落的稻谷，被冲掉了一成，损失很大。陈永康互助组的稻谷不但没有被冲去，而且出苗很好。大雨时加深秧田水是临时的；雨一过就要把水排去，使秧田内经常有新鲜水，没有积水、污水。雨后放晴时，陈永康还耐心地用手把秧沟里的清水徐徐泼在秧苗上，洗去下雨时湔在秧叶上的泥浆。这些泥浆黏在秧叶上，容易坏秧；用清水洗濯，是防止发生病秧的好办法。
    管理秧田水，最要紧的是不能有积水、污水；经常要保持新鲜的水。这样不但可使秧苗出得齐、发育好，而且能防治瘟秧。在污水、积水中，病菌多而且容易滋长，最容易发生病秧；经常换水，可以保持清鲜，病菌减少，且不易繁殖，就可避免病秧的发生。陈永康掌握了这种科学的管理水的方法，所以他的秧田中，几十年来很少发生瘟秧病，秧苗年年长得粗壮健康。
    第三桩是秧田施追肥。陈永康对秧田施追肥也是很讲究的。往年他只施一次人粪；今年的秧苗因落谷后，阴雨过多，发育不快，改施两次肥料。第一次在秧长一寸左右时施，施的是人粪。在五月六日下午四时，他们先排水使秧板脱水，秧板和水沟相平，施上人粪；面积七厘的纯秧板施一担半人粪。施肥时间最好在早晨或傍晚。如果用的是新人粪，有沉淀物，要用旧竹箩滤去粪渣，用流下的半浓粪水。他第二次施的是肥田粉，是在五月十二日中午施的，和第一次隔了六天。施肥田粉时，秧长已是二、三寸了，秧板上有一薄层水，露水已干，均匀地施上肥田粉，正得肥力。施肥田粉不能在早晨，因为早上露水未干；肥田粉有酸性，遇到秧叶上的露水，容易坏秧，使秧叶发焦。大约可种二亩多稻田的秧苗施二斤肥田粉。施上肥田粉后，他又加上薄薄一层稻草灰。这样可以防病，还可以使秧脚松，插秧时好拔，不会把秧脚拔断。秧田如果只施
    一次肥，在插秧前十天到半月施最合宜；如果施二次肥，最好在秧长一寸时施第一次，秧长二寸半到三寸时施第二次。后一次施肥约在拔秧前八天到十天。道理是：如果施得太迟，秧苗正得肥力长嫩时，拔秧易断；如果施得太早，种秧时脱肥力，秧发黄，种在田里长不好。施上肥料后，不能立即换水，要等秧板把肥水将近吸干，再灌清水。
    陈永康和他的互助组，在盐水选种等方面也比去年有改进，六个人分工管理三块秧田，秧苗都长得很好。
