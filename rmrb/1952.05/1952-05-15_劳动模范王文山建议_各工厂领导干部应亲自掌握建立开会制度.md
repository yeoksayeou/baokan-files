    Labor Model Wang Wenshan Suggests
    Leaders at All Factories Should Personally Oversee the Establishment of a Meeting System

    Editor: I think some meetings are necessary. But now there is no system for holding meetings in factories, no preparation, and the meetings are too long. Everyone is a little annoyed when they hear that there is going to be a meeting. I hope that the leading cadres of all enterprises will personally take charge of this issue, establish a system for holding meetings, and avoid holding unnecessary meetings. Too many meetings exhaust everyone, which not only prevents them from producing properly but also leaves them with no time to study, which hinders production and construction.

    劳动模范王文山建议
    各工厂领导干部应亲自掌握建立开会制度
    编辑同志：我认为有些会议是必须开的。但是现在各厂开会没有制度，没有准备，开会时间过长。大家听说要开会，都有些厌烦。我希望各个企业的领导干部亲自掌握这个问题，建立开会的制度，不必要的会议就不要开。开会太多了，大家精疲力竭，不但不能好好生产，而且没有时间学习，这对于生产建设是有妨碍的。
