    We are Confident in Completing This Year's Cotton Production Increase Task
    Li Gongwen, Director of the Wulidian Farm Directly Under the Central Ministry of Agriculture
    Our farm is a state-owned farm mainly engaged in cotton production. As a vigorous production increase campaign is being carried out in the rural areas across the country, we express to the workers and farmers across the country with boundless excitement our confidence and determination to complete this year's cotton production increase task.
    Our farm is a new type of farm established after the liberation of Beijing by utilizing the military wasteland left by the enemy and puppets, and through vigorous land reclamation and planning. Over the past three years, under the correct leadership of the higher authorities and through the hard work of all employees, it has been built into one of the mechanized farms of considerable scale in the suburbs of Beijing.
    This year, in response to the government's call, our farm has launched a patriotic production increase challenge to state-owned farms and farmers across the country, guaranteeing that the main crop—cotton—will yield 550 jin of seed cotton per mu on 800 mu of irrigated land, an increase of 156 percent compared to our farm's 1951 yield, and 358 percent higher than the yield of nearby farmers; on 900 mu of dry land, it will yield 450 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 109 percent compared to our farm's 1951 yield, and 275 percent higher than the yield of nearby farmers. The setting of this production increase target is based on sufficient conditions.
    When our farm began construction in 1949, 170 mu of cotton were planted, yielding 65 jin of seed cotton per mu; in 1950, the cotton planting area was expanded to 2,000 mu, and the yield per mu increased to 133 jin; in 1951, 2,622 mu of cotton were planted, and the yield per mu reached 215.8 jin, 80 percent higher than the general yield of nearby areas.
    Starting this year, our farm is learning from the advanced experience of Soviet agriculture and has implemented a seven-year grass-crop rotation system with cotton as the main crop. This advanced agricultural management method integrating agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry will demonstrate even greater productive power on our own land. Judging from the fact that the yield has been increasing year by year, and from the fact that our farm is implementing an advanced farming system this year, our farm is in a position to propose the above-mentioned production increase task.
    Over the past three years, on the agricultural production front, in the complex struggle against nature, we have initially found the path to increasing cotton production and established the idea of learning from the advanced agricultural production experience of the Soviet Union. This is a fundamental issue for a socialist state-owned farm. After more than two years of continuous learning, we have gradually clarified the narrow and conservative idea of "production reaching its peak" and broken the doubt about the Soviet high-yield records. We have recognized the superiority of advanced Soviet farming techniques. After solving this ideological problem, we will be able to learn and master advanced experience. After mastering and developing these advanced experiences, we will be able to continuously increase the yield per unit area. Our specific production increase measures this year are:
    1. Thoroughly solve the irrigation and drainage problems. Judging from the meteorological data of North China over the years, the rainfall distribution is uneven, and spring droughts and autumn floods often occur. In 1950, because we did not solve the drainage problem in a planned way, 300 mu of cotton fields were flooded; last year, due to the failure to pay attention to soil moisture conservation and drought prevention in time, the cotton seedlings did not emerge well, resulting in losses. Therefore, drought and flood prevention have become one of our main struggle goals for this year's production increase. To this end, we have built a canal with a total length of more than 7,000 meters in the summer and autumn of last year, which can irrigate 5,000 mu of land. Last year, our farm carried out winter irrigation after autumn plowing. After vigorous land preparation this spring, the requirement of "light and frequent watering" has been basically achieved in the cotton fields. In this way, we have initially broken free from the shackles of "relying on the sky for food." At present, the wheat crops and pastures on the winter-irrigated land show a green color, indicating that the good growth of cotton is no longer a problem. Drainage has also been surveyed and designed, and we are preparing to systematically dredge and excavate drainage ditches, and repair dikes and dams in combination with the terrain and topography to ensure that we will not suffer from floods during the season of concentrated rainfall.
    2. Deep plowing and fine harrowing to conserve soil moisture and prevent drought. In the past, although we attached importance to autumn plowing, we did not have enough understanding of deep plowing, and we did not harrow along with plowing, which affected the sowing and seedling protection work. After the autumn harvest in 1951, winter plowing was carried out to a depth of 22 to 24 centimeters, and nail-toothed harrows were used along with plowing, which initially overcame the difficulty of deep plowing. Before thawing this year, harrowing and pressing work were carried out to make the soil fine and level. All non-irrigated land can also maintain considerable moisture. Judging from the current situation, the cotton sowing work will be better completed.
    3. Carefully select good seeds and sow in time. In the past, we planted Sizi No. 2 cotton. Although this cotton seed has the advantages of high lint percentage and long lint, it has a longer growing period and cannot fully open before autumn plowing, which affects autumn plowing and winter irrigation. This year, we are changing to Pingmian No. 3, which has a large yield and a shorter growing period, and strictly select seeds by grain and identify the germination rate. At the same time, we have also conducted detailed research on the sowing period, and try to advance it as much as possible, and complete all sowing before the end of April. This can avoid the losses caused by the late sowing of cotton and the late maturity of cotton seeds last year.
    4. Dense planting, more fertilizer, light and frequent watering. Last year, we did not have enough understanding of cotton dense planting, and only planted 3,200 plants per mu. This year, it has been determined that the number of cotton plants harvested per mu will be more than 4,500. In combination with the requirements of dense planting and yield, apply appropriate amounts of fertilizer. Prepare to apply 2,000 jin of manure, 400 jin of cottonseed cake, 40 jin of lime nitrogen, 10 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 50 jin of superphosphate per mu of irrigated cotton land. These fertilizers are all prepared and treated, and applied in stages in combination with irrigation and cultivation. In terms of irrigation, branch canals and field canals have also been built, and drainage ditches have been dug in the ground according to the terrain. Be sure to do light and frequent watering to provide the cotton plants with appropriate moisture.
    5. Frequent weeding and cultivation, fine pruning. Our farm has determined that cotton fields will be cultivated and weeded more than eight times this year. We must ensure that there is no grass in the ground, the soil is loose, and the quality of cultivation is improved. Cotton pruning should be carried out in a timely manner depending on the growth situation. When removing branches and tips, we must do it "early" and "less" so as not to damage the cotton plants.
    6. Strictly prevent and control diseases and insect pests. Under the policy of "prevention is more important than cure," our farm has begun to universally remove weeds since April 12, in order to eliminate the hosts of diseases and insect pests. We have also prepared sufficient amounts of pesticides and machinery; once diseases and insect pests are found, we will resolutely implement "early treatment, universal treatment, and thorough treatment." In order to ensure the smooth progress of the prevention and control work, we have implemented a strict regional responsibility inspection system, and we must ensure that they are discovered and eliminated in time.
    After the above measures are combined, we believe that this year's production increase target can be fully achieved.
    In addition, we will also work with the nearby farmers to jointly complete the national agricultural production increase task for 1952. First of all, we guarantee to lead the Wulidian Experimental Cooperative Farm under our farm and help them complete the task of producing 400 jin of seed cotton per mu this year. In the nearby villages, we are preparing to organize demonstration mutual aid teams on the basis of the original mutual aid teams of farmers to help them solve problems in terms of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, machinery, and technology. Through cooperative farms and mutual aid teams, exchange advanced experience with each other and lead the masses to do a good job in production.
    The great "Three-Anti" movement has educated all comrades in our farm, and the production enthusiasm of all employees in the farm is particularly high at present. In the bumper harvest competition campaign, we have implemented scientific management methods of "division of labor and responsibility, fixed personnel and quotas," and every working comrade has been involved in the competition upsurge. We are not only confident in guaranteeing the completion of the proposed production increase task, but also strive to exceed it.

    我们有信心完成今年的棉花增产任务
    中央农业部直属五里店农场场长  李恭文
    我场是一个以棉花生产为主的国营农场。当全国农村正在开展轰轰烈烈的增产竞赛运动的时候，我们以无比兴奋的心情，向全国工人、农民表示我们完成本年度棉花增产任务的信心和决心。
    我场是在北京解放后，利用敌伪时代的军用荒地，经过大力机垦和规划整理而新建起来的一个新型农场。三年来，在上级的正确领导下，全体职工辛勤劳动，已把它建设成为京郊具有相当规模的机械化农场之一。
    今年我场响应政府的号召，已向全国国营农场和农民提出爱国增产挑战，保证主要作物——棉花在八百亩灌溉地上，每亩产籽棉五百五十斤，比我场一九五一年的产量提高百分之一百五十六，比附近农民的产量提高百分之三百五十八，在九百亩旱地上，每亩产籽棉四百五十斤，比我场一九五一年的产量提高百分之一百零九，比附近农民的产量提高百分之二百七十五。我们的这个增产目标的订立，是有足够的条件作为基础的。
    我场在一九四九年开始建场时，植棉一百七十亩，每亩产籽棉六十五斤；一九五零年植棉面积扩大到二千亩，每亩产量提高到一百三十三斤；一九五一年植棉二千六百二十二亩，每亩产量达到二百一十五点八斤，比附近一般产量高出百分之八十。
    从今年开始，我场学习苏联农业的先进经验，已实行以棉花为主的七年草田轮作制。这种农林牧三位一体的先进农业经营方式，将要在我们自己的土地上显示出更大的生产威力来。从产量逐年增高的这一事实上看，从今年我场实行先进的耕作制度上看，我场是有条件提出上面的增产任务的。
    三年来，我们在农业生产战线上，在向自然所作的复杂斗争中，初步找到了棉花增产的门径，树立起了学习苏联先进农业生产经验的思想。这对一个社会主义性质的国营农场来说，是一个带根本性质的问题。经过了两年多不断的学习，我们已逐渐澄清了狭隘保守的“生产到顶”的思想，打破了对苏联高产纪录的怀疑。我们已认识了苏联先进耕作技术的优越性。解决了这个思想上的问题以后，我们就有可能学习并掌握先进的经验。在掌握并发展了这些先进经验之后，我们就有可能不断提高单位面积产量。我们今年的具体增产办法是：
    1、彻底解决灌溉及排水问题。从华北历年气象材料看来，雨量分布不均，春旱秋涝时常发生，一九五零年我场因为没有有计划地解决排水问题，棉田被淹了三百亩；去年因未能及时注意保墒防旱，棉苗出得不好，受了损失。因此，防旱防涝便成为我们今年争取增产的主要斗争目标之一。为此，我们在去年夏、秋两季已修筑了一条全长七千多公尺的渠道，可灌溉田地五千亩。去年我场秋耕后已实行冬灌。经今春大力整地后，在棉田中基本上已能够达到“轻浇勤浇”的要求。这样，我们就初步摆脱了“靠天吃饭”的桎梏。现在冬灌地上的麦类作物及牧草呈现出一片青绿，可见棉花的良好生长已不成问题。排水方面也已进行勘测设计，我们准备有系统地疏浚和挖掘排水沟，并结合地形地势整修堤坝，保证在雨量集中的季节中，不致遭受涝灾。
    2、深耕细耙，保墒防旱。过去我们虽然重视秋耕，但对深耕认识不足，加上没有随耕随耙，影响了播种保苗工作。一九五一年秋收后实行冬耕，深度二十二到二十四公分，并带钉齿耙随耕随耙，初步克服了深耕的困难。今年解冻前进行了耙地和压地工作，使土壤细碎平整。所有未经灌溉的土地，也能保持相当水分。照目前的情况看来，棉花的播种工作，将会更好地完成。
    3、精选良种，及时播种。过去我们种的是斯字二号棉，这种棉种虽有衣分大、绒毛长的优点，但生长期较长，到秋耕前还不能全数吐絮，影响秋耕冬灌。今年改种产量大生长期较短的平棉三号，并严格粒选，鉴定发芽率。同时在播种时期上也详加研讨，尽可能提早，在四月底以前可以全部播完。这就可以避免去年因棉花播种较迟和棉种成熟较晚所造成的损失。
    4、密植多肥，轻浇勤浇。去年我们对棉花密植认识不足，每亩只种了三千二百株。今年确定每亩棉花收获株数为四千五百株以上。并结合密植及产量要求施以适量肥料。准备水地棉花每亩施土粪二千斤，棉子饼四百斤，石灰氮四十斤，硫酸錏十斤，过磷酸石灰五十斤。这些肥料均加以调配处理，结合灌溉中耕分期施下。灌溉方面亦已筑好斗渠毛渠，并依地势情况酌挖地中排水沟。一定作到轻浇勤浇，供给棉株以适当的水分。
    5、勤锄勤趟，精细整枝。我场棉田今年确定中耕锄草八次以上。要作到地内无草，土壤松软，提高中耕质量。棉花整枝方面依据生长情况及时进行。在打杈打尖时，要作到“打得早”“打得少”，不使棉株受到伤害。
    6、严格防治病虫害。我场在“防重于治”的方针下，已自四月十二日开始普遍清除杂草，借以消灭病虫害的寄主。我们并以准备好足量的药械；一旦发现病虫灾害，即坚决实行“早治、普治、彻底治”。为了保证防治工作的顺利进行，我们已实行严格的分区负责检查制度，务必作到及时发现及时除尽。
    在上述办法结合进行之后，我们相信今年增产的目标是完全可以达到的。
    此外，我们还要和附近的农民们一起，共同来完成一九五二年全国农业增产任务。首先我们保证领导好本场所属五里店实验合作农场，帮助他们完成今年每亩产籽棉四百斤的任务。在附近各村，我们准备在农民原来互助组的基础上，组织示范互助组，帮助他们解决种籽肥料药械，以及技术方面的问题。通过合作农场及互助组，彼此交流先进经验，带动群众搞好生产。
    伟大的“三反”运动教育了我场全体同志，目前全场职工的生产热情格外高涨。在丰产竞赛运动中，我们已实行“分工负责，定员定额”的科学管理方法，每个工作同志都卷入了竞赛高潮。我们不但有信心保证完成已提出的增产任务，还要争取超过。
