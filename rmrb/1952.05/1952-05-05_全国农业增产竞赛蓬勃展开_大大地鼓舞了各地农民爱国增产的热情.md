    The National Agricultural Production Increase Campaign Flourishes
    Greatly Inspiring the Patriotic Enthusiasm of Farmers in Various Regions to Increase Production
    The patriotic production increase campaign in the rural areas across the country has vigorously unfolded before the "May Day" Labor Day. The broad masses of farmers have been drawn into this mass labor competition movement to increase crop yields per unit area. All farmers participating in the competition have set specific targets for increasing production, are full of confidence, and guarantee to complete the state's task of increasing grain and cotton production in 1952.
    As of mid-April, more than thirty state-owned farms in more than twenty provinces and regions across the country had accepted challenges from state-owned farms such as the Beijing Shuangqiao Farm. More than a thousand well-known agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams directly accepted challenges from Li Shunda, Yang Zhenru, Qu Yaoli, Shi Anfu, and others, participating in comprehensive production increase competitions or production increase competitions for rice, cotton, and wheat. These mutual aid organizations and farmers who accepted the challenges simultaneously issued challenges locally, becoming the core of the local production increase campaign. This movement has been widely carried out in various regions. In Hunan Province, no fewer than 200,000 households of farmers have participated in the rice production increase competition. Now, the movement is continuing to unfold in the countryside with the spring plowing and sowing. Farmers of various ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Xikang and other provinces are also actively accepting challenges and participating in the competition.
    The production increase campaign has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of farmers across the country to increase production, dispelling the original conservative ideas of many farmers. For example, nearly a hundred agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, such as Song Zongguo and others in East China, and agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations such as Cheng Baifu and others in Pingyuan Province, have proposed to increase the yield per unit area of various crops by 15% to 20% or more, exceeding the average yield per unit area in the local area. According to incomplete statistics from Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Ninghe in Hebei, more than 460 mutual aid and cooperative organizations have decided to create records of producing 1,000 to 1,800 catties of rice per mu.
    In order to ensure the completion of the production increase plan, farmers in various regions enthusiastically learn advanced experience and scientific and technological knowledge for achieving high yields. Farmers in Pingxiang organized visiting groups to learn from Li Chenggui's experience in high rice yields in Liling County, Hunan, and promoted Li Chenggui's advanced experience. In order to meet the farmers' learning needs, local people's governments and state-owned farms are now providing assistance in various aspects. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Shaanxi Province are promoting the dissemination of scientific agricultural technology to farmers in fifteen major wheat and cotton producing areas in Guanzhong Jingyang and Sanyuan in Shaanxi Province. Short-term training courses for agricultural production cadres and production activists have been held in various parts of Hunan Province.
    The production increase campaign has powerfully promoted the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperation and mutual aid organizations. Farmers in Zhao Chang Township, Suining County, Northern Jiangsu, said: "Individual strength is small, and we dare not accept challenges as mutual aid groups. We are not afraid of anything if we are organized!" In Dongzhuangzi, Ninghe County, Hebei, there were only five mutual aid groups organized by more than forty households last year. In order to participate in the competition, all more than two hundred households in the village have organized this year. The number of people organized in Xinli Village, Tianjin County, has increased from 50% last year to 80%. In Jingyang, Hancheng, and other nine counties in Shaanxi, the number of agricultural mutual aid groups has increased to more than 20,000 in the production increase competition.
    Farmers and mutual aid organizations participating in the competition have all formulated production plans for this year, thus beginning to organize scattered agricultural production, so that agricultural production can better obey the state's overall economic plan and develop in a planned manner.

    全国农业增产竞赛蓬勃展开
    大大地鼓舞了各地农民爱国增产的热情
    全国农村中爱国主义的增产竞赛运动已在“五一”劳动节前蓬勃展开，广大农民卷入了这一个提高农田单位面积产量的群众性的劳动竞赛运动。所有参加竞赛的农民都订有增产的具体目标，都充满着信心，保证完成国家今年所提出的一九五二年的粮、棉增产的任务。
    截至四月中旬，全国各地已有二十多个省区的三十多个国营农场向北京双桥农场等国营农场应战，有一千多个著名的农业生产合作社、互助组直接向李顺达、杨振儒、曲耀离、史安福等应战，参加全面增产竞赛或水稻、棉花、小麦的增产竞赛。这些应战的互助组织和农民同时又在当地挑战，成为当地增产竞赛运动的核心。这一运动在各地开展已极广泛。湖南省参加水稻增产竞赛的农民已不下二十万户。现在，运动正随着春耕春播在农村中继续开展。新疆、青海、西康等省各少数民族的农民，也正纷纷应战，参加竞赛。
    增产竞赛运动大大地鼓舞了全国农民增产的热情，打消了许多农民原有的保守思想。如华东区宋宗国等近百个农业生产合作社和互助组，以及平原省成百福等农业互助合作组织都提出要把各种作物的单位面积产量提高一成半到二成以上，超过当地单位面积的平均产量。据浙江、福建、湖南、湖北、江西和河北宁河的不完全统计，已有四百六十多个互助合作组织决定创造每亩水稻产一千斤到一千八百斤的纪录。
    为了保证增产计划的完成，各地农民热情地学习先进的丰产经验和科学技术知识。萍乡农民组织参观团到湖南醴陵县学习李承桂水稻丰产经验，并推广了李承桂的先进经验。为了满足农民的学习要求，现在各地人民政府和国营农场都从各方面予以协助。西北军政委员会农林部、陕西省农林厅在陕西省关中泾阳、三原等十五个麦、棉主要产区向广大农民推行科学的农业技术传授工作。湖南省各地都举办了农业生产干部和生产积极分子短期训练班。
    增产竞赛运动有力地推动了农业合作互助组织的发展和巩固。苏北睢宁县赵场乡农民说：“个人力量小，不敢向互助组应战，组织起来就不怕啥了！”河北宁河县董庄子去年只有四十多户组织起来的五个互助组，为了参加竞赛，今年全村二百多户都组织起来了。天津县新立村组织起来的人数已由去年的百分之五十发展到百分之八十。陕西泾阳、韩城等九个县的农业互助组在增产竞赛中发展到二万多个。
    参加竞赛的农民和互助组织都订有今年生产计划，这样就把分散的农业生产开始组织起来，从而使农业生产更能服从国家整个的经济计划而有计划地发展。  （新华社）
