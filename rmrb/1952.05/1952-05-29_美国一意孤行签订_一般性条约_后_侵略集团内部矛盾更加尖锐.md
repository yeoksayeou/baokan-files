Xinhua News Agency, May 28th -- After the United States insisted on signing the "General Treaty," internal contradictions within the aggression bloc became more acute.

Under pressure from the United States, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France signed the "General Treaty" with West German puppet government Premier Adenauer in Bonn on the 26th. The United States attempts to deepen the division of Germany and drag West Germany into the North Atlantic aggression bloc by signing this disguised separate peace treaty, and openly carry out its plan to massively arm West Germany in preparation for a new war. However, this unilateral approach by the United States has not only created greater chaos and divisions within the aggression bloc, but will only bring greater resistance to itself.

The signing of the "General Treaty" was a step determined as early as last September at the Washington conference of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France. However, it has been opposed by the vast majority of the German people and the people of European countries from the beginning. Precisely because of this, the secret negotiations in Bonn between the high commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany and Adenauer for the conclusion of this treaty have repeatedly stalled since they began last September. Especially after the Soviet Union submitted a note to the United States, Britain, and France on March 10 proposing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the sentiment among the German and Western European people demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany based on the principles of the Soviet proposal and opposing the signing of the "General Treaty" became even stronger. This has plunged the entire US policy of splitting Germany to arm West Germany into a serious crisis. The American "New York Herald Tribune" admitted in an editorial titled "Major Diplomatic Crisis" on April 16 that, as a result of the Soviet note, the diplomatic policies of the United States, Britain, and France were facing a "real agonizing crisis."

In this situation, the United States, on the one hand, adopted delaying tactics towards the Soviet proposals, refusing the Soviet Union's repeated suggestions to immediately hold four-power negotiations on concluding a peace treaty with Germany. On the other hand, it intensified negotiations with Adenauer on the "General Treaty" to create a fait accompli. The United States used all kinds of coercive measures from all sides to force the Bonn negotiations to end hastily on May 22 and sign the treaty on the 26th.

However, the US measure of signing the "General Treaty" with Adenauer at all costs first aroused more intense opposition from the vast majority of the German people, and thus expanded the contradictions within the West German ruling clique. West Germany's largest reactionary party, the Social Democratic Party, as well as the Free Democratic Party and the German Party, which participated in the Adenauer government, had to openly oppose the signing of the "General Treaty" because they were compelled by the indignant sentiments of the people. Schumacher, the head of the right-wing Social Democratic Party, who has always strongly advocated the rearmament of West Germany, was forced by pressure from lower-level party members to announce on May 22 that "whoever agrees with the General Treaty is no longer a German." Even many members of Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union raised the same objections. According to an Agence France-Presse Bonn dispatch, before signing the "General Treaty," Adenauer "railed against the crisis in his coalition government over the General Treaty" at a secret meeting on May 10, coercing the parties to withdraw their objections, but to no avail. Therefore, the American imperialists are now very worried that the Bonn parliament will not ratify the "General Treaty." An Associated Press dispatch from Bonn on the 23rd said: "Once the treaty is signed, it will face obstacles to ratification by the parliaments of the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, and it is expected that the main trouble will occur in the Bonn parliament."

The US measure of signing the "General Treaty" with Adenauer at all costs also aroused stronger opposition from the people of Western Europe and intensified the contradictions between France, Britain, and other countries and the United States. This situation is prominently manifested in the French government's hesitation in signing the "General Treaty." Fearing the strong force of the French people opposing the arming of West Germany, the French government had requested the United States at the meeting held by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France with Adenauer from the 24th to the 26th to "guarantee" before signing the treaty that the rebuilt West German army would not be used against France, and to guarantee that it would not interfere in France's affairs in North African colonies. If the United States did not agree, France would not sign. A United Press dispatch from Bonn on the 24th admitted: "France's sudden demands threw the foreign ministers' meeting into confusion." Only after the United States used coercion against the French government, threatening to cancel financial and military "aid" to France, did the French government withdraw its demands and subserviently sign the "General Treaty."

All these encounters of the United States in the process of signing the "General Treaty" clearly demonstrate the fragility of this "General Treaty" forcibly signed by the United States, and show that the US war policy will encounter countless difficulties in the future.

### 美国一意孤行签订“一般性条约”后  侵略集团内部矛盾更加尖锐

    美国一意孤行签订“一般性条约”后
    侵略集团内部矛盾更加尖锐
    【新华社二十八日讯】在美国的高压下，美、英、法三国外长已于二十六日在波恩与西德傀儡政府总理阿登纳签订了“一般性条约”。美国企图通过签订这个变相的单独和约，来加深德国的分裂，把西德拖入北大西洋侵略集团，而公开进行其大规模武装西德以准备新战争的计划。但是，美国这种一意孤行的做法，不仅已在侵略集团内部造成了更大的混乱与分歧，而且只能给自己招来更大的反抗。
    “一般性条约”之签订是早在去年九月美、英、法三国外长华盛顿会议上就确定了的步骤。但是，它自始就遭到德国广大人民和欧洲各国人民的反对。正因为如此，美、英、法三国驻德高级专员与阿登纳之间为缔结这个条约而在波恩进行的秘密谈判，自去年九月开始以后，就一再陷入僵局。特别在今年三月十日苏联向美、英、法三国提出建议缔结对德和约的照会以后，德国和西欧人民要求根据苏联建议的原则缔结对德和约、反对签订“一般性条约”的情绪更趋强烈。这就使美国分裂德国以武装西德的整个政策陷入了严重危机。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”曾于四月十六日在题为“外交大危机”的社论中承认：由于苏联照会的结果，美、英、法三国的外交政策已面临一个“真正的使人苦痛的危机”。
    在这种情况下，美国一方面对苏联建议采取拖延策略，拒绝苏联所一再提出的四国立即举行关于缔结对德和约谈判的建议，一方面即加紧与阿登纳进行“一般性条约”的谈判，来造成既成事实。美国从各方面使用了一切高压手段，强使波恩谈判于五月二十二日匆匆结束，并于二十六日签字。
    但是，美国不顾一切地与阿登纳签订“一般性条约”的措施，首先激起了德国绝大多数人民更加猛烈的反对，并因此而扩大了西德统治集团内部的矛盾。西德最大的反动政党——社会民主党、以及参加阿登纳政府的自由民主党和德意志党，就都因为迫于人民的激愤情绪而不得不公开反对签订“一般性条约”。一贯大力鼓吹西德重新武装的右翼社会民主党头子舒马赫在下层党员的压力下，竟不得不在五月二十二日宣布“谁赞同一般性条约，谁就不再是德国人”。甚至阿登纳自己的基督教民主党内也有许多党员提出同样的反对意见。据法新社波恩消息透露：阿登纳在签订“一般性条约”以前，曾于五月十日在一个秘密会议上“对他的联合政府内所发生的关于一般性条约的危机大肆咆哮”，胁迫各党派撤销它们的反对意见，但是结果并未奏效。因此美帝国主义者目前已在十分担心波恩议会会不会不批准“一般性条约”。美联社波恩二十三日电说：“条约一经签订，就要面临美、英、法、德四国议会批准的障碍了，预料主要的麻烦要在波恩议会中发生。”
    美国不顾一切地与阿登纳签订“一般性条约”的措施，同样也激起了西欧人民更加强烈的反对，并使法、英等国与美国之间的矛盾日益尖锐。这种情形突出地表现在法国政府对签订“一般性条约”的犹疑上。由于害怕法国人民反对武装西德的强大力量，法国政府曾在美、英、法三国外长与阿登纳在二十四日至二十六日举行的会议上，要求美国在签订条约前“保证”重建的西德军队不得用来对付法国，并保证不干涉法国在北非殖民地的事务等项条件，如果美国不同意，法国就不签字。合众社波恩二十四日电承认：“法国的突如其来的要求使得外长会议混乱失措。”只是在美国对法国政府使用高压，以取消对法国的财政及军事“援助”相威胁以后，法国政府才撤销了它的这些要求，而屈从地在“一般性条约”上签了字。
  　所有这些美国在签订“一般性条约”过程中的遭遇，都清楚地表明了美国强行签订的这个“一般性条约”的脆弱性，表明了美国的战争政策在今后还将遭到无数的困难。
