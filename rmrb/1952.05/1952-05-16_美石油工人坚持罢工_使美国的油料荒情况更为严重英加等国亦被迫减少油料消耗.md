(Xinhua News Agency, May 13th, New York) News: The nationwide strike of 90,000 US oil workers, which began on April 29th, continues to this day. The workers have rejected the US government's demands to return to work and continue to fight for their own interests.

The continuation of the oil workers' strike has further aggravated the shortage of oil, especially aviation fuel, in the United States. The government has ordered the cessation of sales of aviation gasoline to retailers and consumers with more than three days' worth of oil reserves. Due to the reduced supply of oil, major airlines have reduced domestic and international passenger flights and have completely or partially suspended cargo flights. May 17th is US Army Day, but Secretary of Defense Lovett has had to order the Army, Navy, and Air Force to cancel all related commemorative flights.

Since the United States is the main oil-supplying country in the capitalist world, the impact of the US oil workers' strike has rapidly spread to other capitalist countries in Europe and America. British commercial airlines have reduced aviation fuel consumption by 30 percent since May 12th. At the same time, the British Air Force has also canceled all training flights except for those using kerosene-powered jet aircraft. The Canadian Department of National Defence has ordered a 35 percent reduction in both civil aviation and military flights. Finland has suspended some flights and is preparing to reduce aviation fuel consumption by half. Oil shortages have also occurred in several northern states of Mexico.

In the face of this severe oil shortage, the US and British governments jointly requested on the 10th that the countries of the US-British bloc conserve aviation fuel.

US oil monopoly capitalists have used government pressure to force striking workers, attempting to force the union to abandon reasonable wage demands, which has only complicated wage negotiations further. According to Knight, president of the Oil Workers International Union of the CIO, political forces and government intervention will only make negotiations difficult and irresolvable.

    美石油工人坚持罢工
    使美国的油料荒情况更为严重英加等国亦被迫减少油料消耗
    【新华社十三日讯】纽约消息：美国九万石油工人从四月二十九日开始的全国性大罢工，迄今仍在坚持中。工人们拒绝了美国政府迫使他们复工的要求，继续为争取切身利益而斗争。
    石油工人罢工的延续，已使美国国内缺乏油料特别是航空油料的情况更为严重。政府已下令停止出售航空汽油给零售商和有三天以上存油的消费户。由于油料供应减少，各大航空公司已纷纷削减国内外客机班次，并全部或部分停止货运飞行。五月十七日是美国陆军节，但是国防部长罗维特却不得不下令陆海空军取消一切有关纪念的飞行活动。
    由于美国是资本主义世界的主要石油供应国家，美国石油工人罢工的影响已迅速扩及欧美其他资本主义国家。英国商用航空公司从五月十二日起减少飞行油料消耗百分之三十。同时，英国空军也已经取消了除使用火油的喷气式飞机而外所有的教练飞行。加拿大国防部已下令民用航空和军事飞行都减少百分之三十五。芬兰已停止了若干飞行，并准备减少航空用油量一半。墨西哥北部数州也发生了油荒。
    在这种石油严重缺乏的情况下，美英两国政府已在十日联合要求美英集团各国节省使用航空油料。
    美国石油垄断资本家曾通过政府对罢工工人强施压力，企图迫使工会放弃合理的工资要求，结果使工资谈判更趋复杂化。据产联石油工人国际工会主席奈特表示，政治力量与政府的干预，只会使谈判变得严重而无法解决。
