　　China's Spring
    ——Written for the Soviet "Literary Gazette"
    Ding Ling
    Today, on this spring day of 1952, as the gentle sunlight falls upon my desk, as the snow quietly melts, as I stride across Moscow's squares, and as the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and advanced culture educate me, a topic comes into my life. It arrives on my desk like a pale yellow sunbeam, clearly and beautifully inscribed on my clean, white paper, deeply imprinted in my mind: Ah, "China's Spring," China's Spring! Is not the word "China" itself the embodiment of spring? When you think of China, you see freshness everywhere, with all new things sprouting under the bright sunshine and in the gentle breeze, growing vigorously, and everywhere you feel an irresistible force. This force is just like the troika described by Gogol, which can never be caught, "the ground flies up in dust beneath it, the bridge roars, and everything is left behind it." China! China is rushing towards the light, towards collectivization, towards the direction indicated by Mao Zedong.
    "China," springtime China, as I sing your praises, a fountain seems to rise from my heart. I cannot sort out this surging enthusiasm, nor can I find appropriate language in time. I envy the singers of the Moscow Grand Theatre, who can indeed pour out the emotions they want to express and should express, infecting people's hearts appropriately. But regardless, I want to cheer! I want to cheer with all my strength: China! The people's China, Mao Zedong's China! You have brought a rich spring atmosphere, with a hundred flowers blooming; you have brought life, vigorous strength, and warmth and happiness!
    However, as I sing your praises, as I sing the praises of your present, I cannot help but think of your past—the harsh winter. You once took such difficult steps, traversing a long historical stage. In several decades, you turned over the nine million five hundred and ninety-seven thousand square kilometers of land, you enabled five hundred million people to stand up freely, you overthrew the feudal system of thousands of years, and you eliminated the heinous fascist and imperialist invaders on your own territory. You promoted the traditional Chinese virtues of diligence and bravery; and you are also eradicating the decadent and vulgar thoughts left behind by the bourgeoisie. China has grown up in struggle, and it is still in struggle. For the sake of its ideals, it will overcome all forces hindering its progress.
    Now, let us return to an ancient era. It is the era of Gogol, the era of Tolstoy, the era of Shevchenko, the era of Gorky's childhood. I was born, born in the first decade of the twentieth century in China. Although in Russia it was already the time of the "stormy petrel," with the revolution led by Lenin and Stalin, what was different in the village where I was born from the situation in Gogol's novels and Shevchenko's poems? Today, Soviet children, wearing red scarves, go to the Children's Palace to study science and art. But what was educating me at that time? When I was still a child who should be playing hide-and-seek and jumping rope. There was nothing else, only the darkness and corruption of the feudal landlord family and all the tyranny, as well as the man-eating ethical code. People were like that. People had to learn to endure, to cultivate a strong will, and to store up all the strength of resistance. I didn't learn anything, like many people of my time, except for one idea: "The old should be destroyed, all shackles must be cut off! To break through the cage, for the sake of light, for the sake of the motherland, to be a rebel of the times, society, and family."
    I also had the most enviable youth. I should have been full of joy of life. I should have gone dancing and ice skating. But what did I have to be proud of? I was just like a moth, flying around blindly, searching for light in the darkness. I even felt like an old woman, lying on the ground, kissing the damp soil and crying. I felt that my body was too light to bear the suffering of this era. I once lived in Hangzhou, a famous place in China, praised by foreign poets. But I could only sing loudly on the mountain peaks to dispel my depression. I couldn't even feel the beauty of the lake and mountains. I also wandered the streets of old Beijing, like a glutton greedily devouring knowledge, trying to find a way from Western culture. To this day, I am unwilling to carefully recall that tragic youth, an era that should have been as beautiful as spring flowers, but was filled with sorrow, indignation, struggle, and resistance. However, I should also be so happy, in such an era, I slowly came to reality, I found the truth, I was with the people, I stood under the banner of such a lovely person, Mao Zedong, serving as a small soldier. Like many young people, I threw myself into the fervent flames of revolution. We no longer get drunk and sing wildly, but raise the torch of revolution, singing "Arise, ye prisoners of starvation..." We no longer linger in the streets, but march towards the reactionaries in orderly steps! We started a new life under the guidance of Mao Zedong. It was once so difficult, but we got through it. We are on the road to the light. We are on the road to a great ideal. We have Marxism-Leninism, we have Stalin, we have Mao Zedong!
    Under the banner of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are carrying out complex, tortuous, and extremely arduous revolutionary struggles. As early as 1926, we had been victorious. But the gentlemen could no longer sleep soundly, they trembled, they clamored, and even the faces of the intellectuals turned pale. So the reactionaries betrayed the revolution and betrayed the fruits of the people's victory. Can we still forget the bloody lessons the reactionaries gave us in 1927? Wherever we went, there were arrests and massacres. White terror spread everywhere. But, ah! You, Chairman Mao, you raised the red flag high on Jinggang Mountain, you were like a ray of sunshine shining in people's hearts, you were like a lighthouse at sea in the dark night, you pointed out the direction of the revolution, inspired people's fighting spirit, and spread hope and confidence to the people. The Second Revolutionary Civil War burned like wildfire in more than a dozen provinces in the north and south! Revolutionary forces gathered, and revolutionary experience was accumulated. Chairman Mao! You know how proud the people in the old revolutionary base areas are to talk about their past, and how much the people from far and near yearn for this sacred place of revolution!
    What people never forget, and will always be used as a subject of praise by poets, is the 25,000-li Long March. The iron Red Army marched from Jiangxi to northern Shaanxi, walking on rugged mountain roads, in dangerous waves, on snow-capped mountains where there were no birds or weeds, and in boundless swamps. They also passed through one ethnic minority area after another. They had enemies in front of them, pursuers behind them, reactionaries on the left, and the armed forces of landlords on the right, but nothing could stop this "iron torrent." They created one miracle after another. When a Red Army soldier thought of the songs of his hometown on the moonlit prairie, he then thought of Chairman Mao, who was sleeping not far from them. They could no longer sleep, they had to guard this land. They had to polish their guns and kill the enemy for Chairman Mao, who was sleeping not far from them. The 25,000-li Long March was victorious. This Long March, this victory, is itself a great epic. Poets have written and left behind many poems, but what we love to read most, and never tire of reading, is the poem that wrote about this epic Long March with the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers, and it is also the most important creator of this epic, Comrade Mao Zedong. We are willing to review this emotion again, we are willing to recite this famous poem again:
    The Red Army fears not the trials of the Long March,
    Holding light ten thousand crags and torrents.
    The Five Ridges wind like gentle ripples,
    And the majestic Wumeng Mountains are mere mud balls beneath our feet.
    The gold sands, warm with cliff-side waves,
    And the iron chains icy over the Tatu Bridge.
    We love the Minshan Mountains, snow-capped after a thousand li,
    And faces beam when the three armies have passed.
    The center of the Chinese revolution arrived in northern Shaanxi, and Chairman Mao was stationed in Yan'an. Yan'an, this small and remote mountain city, became a world-famous city. The anti-Japanese united front was here, the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan was also here, the revolutionary forces were expanded and consolidated here, and the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism was also here. Yan'an! How many cadres you have trained and how many people's thoughts you have transformed. In that auditorium, Chairman Mao's inscription still remains: "Seek Truth from Facts." Everyone who has lived in Yan'an has regarded you as a home, the only home, and is reluctant to leave, and will always miss you after leaving. The people of northern Shaanxi, who have always been good at singing, have become even better at singing and love singing even more since they had Chairman Mao. The old peasant Sun Wanfu recited many poems when he saw Chairman Mao, and now this song has spread throughout more than 20 provinces in China: "Tall buildings rise from the ground, dragons coil and tigers crouch on the top of high mountains, the sun in the liberated area is red and red, and our leader is Mao Zedong!" The farmer Li Zhengzeng sang the words in everyone's heart: "The East is red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong, he seeks happiness for the people, he is the great savior of the people." I have heard this song in Moscow, in Stalingrad, and in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Soviet friends! I think you will understand the endless emotions that surged in my heart after hearing this Shaanxi folk song!
    The Anti-Japanese War was victorious, the War of Liberation was victorious, and Chairman Mao guided us from one victory to another. The red flag of victory, the red flag of people's liberation, and the red flag of peace were planted from north to south, and from east to west. All of China was liberated. New China was born. From the east of the world, a dawn rose. People who love peace all over the world applauded and cheered. China's liberation has added so much strength to world peace. New China stands on the side of upholding peace, on the side of the Soviet Union, on the side of Comrade Stalin!
    That day, October 1, 1949. The sky in Beijing was blue and powdery, and the people of Beijing were wearing new clothes, excited as if their hearts were burning. Their hearts flew with the songs and the shouts of "Long live" to one place, Tiananmen Square. The river of people also rushed to Tiananmen Square. The square in front of Tiananmen was a sea of people and a sea of flags. Red waves rolled. People repeated a voice: "Long live Mao Zedong!" Everyone looked up, and Tiananmen was also full of people. Everyone looked for someone in the crowd, ah, that tall figure is the person in the hearts of the people. Ah! Mao Zedong! Ah, Chairman Mao! We will always follow you, always serve the people, and be a small soldier who does not fall behind. On this day, Chairman Mao stood out, everyone saw him, his voice resounded through Tiananmen, resounded through Beijing, resounded throughout China, and also resounded throughout the world. He announced the birth of New China and the establishment of the Central People's Government. Everything new started from this day, spring has come, China's spring!
    In springtime China, people's lives are undergoing tremendous changes. There is a Yao Da Niang in Tianjin, and she once said: "I am a poor old woman. In the past, under the rule of the Japanese and the Kuomintang, I suffered from hunger and cold, and suffered all kinds of bullying and insults. My man pedaled a tricycle, broke his leg and had no money to treat it. My son sold ice and pulled a cart, and the money he earned was not enough for the whole family to eat sweet potato noodles. The children were so hungry that they cried. I didn't have a sip of soup for two days after giving birth, and I was so hungry that I saw stars in front of my eyes and fell off the bed..." But now, she said: "After liberation, our lives have risen to the sky in one step. We eat enough and wear warm clothes, and we are no longer bullied. My two sons have jobs in the factory." This Yao Da Niang caught a special agent in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. The people praised her everywhere, and she said again: "This was originally my duty, but the people supported me so enthusiastically, sent me many pennants and gifts, and asked me to give reports everywhere. My name was also published in the newspaper. I really couldn't say how I felt. I couldn't sleep at night and thought: Could this be a dream? Can a poor person still have this day? Even the mayor shook hands with me when he met me." She suddenly sat up and saw the dazzling mirrors and colorful pennants hanging all over the room. She suddenly saw a photo in the middle of these, a photo of Chairman Mao. She then exclaimed excitedly: "This is true! Isn't it he, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party who gave me what I have today?"
    People's lives have improved, and people's demands are also different. Old people in their seventies also carry books to literacy classes every day, unwilling to fall behind the young people. The Hunan "Dazhong Daily" conducted discussions on land reform, production, and current affairs issues in the newspaper, and about a thousand peasants enthusiastically wrote articles to participate in the discussions. Li Shunda, the national agricultural labor model and the banner of agricultural production cooperatives, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao in July 1951, talking about the changes in his ideological understanding. From an ordinary peasant, he understood the relationship between urban and rural areas, the leading role of the working class, and the need to care about politics and study Marxism-Leninism! New technologies and new agricultural tools are being used in large quantities in rural areas, and they are slowly moving from mutual aid to agricultural production cooperatives. They adopt the method of paying according to labor days, and they are also gradually increasing public means of production. And on the north Manchurian grasslands in the northeast, on the south bank of the Songhua River, a happy collective farm has appeared. The villagers do their best according to socialist principles and are paid according to their work. They have improved their management methods year by year, and they have abundant harvests. They live a happy life, and each family has several houses with electric lights. They have clothes for festivals, and new books are placed on the bookshelves. They read "History of Social Development," they read "Biography of Michurin," some read "Our Goal is Communism," and some read "New Literary Tutorial." This completely ideal life has been realized, and this news is being paid attention to by farmers across the country, and they are moving towards the same happy environment as Soviet farmers. Their brilliant future is our common vision. Catch up! All the farmers in China! This is not far away, as long as we work hard, we will soon be the same as them.
    The industrial achievements are countless. The number of railways has increased, and the rivers are flowing smoothly. People are sitting in spacious new trains, speeding forward, and the beautiful, fertile, and vast fields are displayed outside the car windows. Inside the car, people listen to music and read books. "We must repair the Huai River well" is Chairman Mao's great call. The people responded to this call, and three million people formed a majestic army. They want to change history and fight against nature. Workers educate farmers on technology, and cadres unite with technical experts. They are united in a fierce battle to race against floods and race against time. The Huai River has been repaired, and the flood that has caused disasters for thousands of years has been tamed. They have gates, reservoirs, and also want electrification. The Huai River will become a beautiful river, a lovely river.
    After the working class got rid of oppression and became the leading class of the country, they naturally developed a sense of ownership, established a new labor attitude, and productivity increased day by day. A new record surpassed a new record. They proposed labor competitions, they signed patriotic covenants, and they launched technical improvement and rationalization proposal movements. Labor models emerged like bamboo shoots after rain. This short piece of white paper cannot write about their new achievements and those glorious names. And they have entered workers' schools, entered Renmin University, and entered the Central Institute of Literature. Their articles are published in the "People's Daily," the "Workers' Daily," the "Literary Gazette," and "People's Literature." They staged their own plays in the Labor People's Cultural Palace. The play "Not a Cicada" was performed from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan, and from Beijing to Shanghai. Workers love to watch it, and writers hold symposiums for them. They want to be at the forefront of everything.
    People have changed rapidly in all the movements. People have abandoned selfishness and developed patriotism and internationalism. To resist US aggression and aid Korea, everyone has risen up to defend peace, with demonstrations here and parades there. Young people went to the front lines. Old ladies also held notebooks and asked people to sign the peace book. Our volunteers have been fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army from October 1950 to the present, regardless of the brutal bombing of US imperialism and the bacteriological weapons attacks opposed by people all over the world. The green mountains were burned into black mountains, and the black mountains were bombed into yellow mountains. The land has changed color, but the bright red flag still stands on the position. In the most difficult days, they nailed pictures from cigarette boxes from the motherland into the trenches, "Motherland, I will fight for you to the end!" Everyone, old and young, throughout China understands that our soldiers are the most lovable. They are the people's soldiers, the protectors of peace, and they are always loyal to their sacred duties.
    China has won, and China is full of the sunshine of spring. China is walking on a road full of flowers. People who drink water should not forget the people who dug the well. Who made us like this? The common people are singing, it is Chairman Mao's kindness, it is the Communist Party's proposition, it is Comrade Stalin's teachings and the help of the Soviet people. The unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union has become a guarantee of world peace.
    China has won, China is full of the sunshine of spring, China is walking on a road full of flowers. Chairman Mao told us: This is just the first step in the Long March. We still have to carry out long-term, complex, and arduous struggles to maintain our already achieved victory and to obtain greater victories. The Chinese people must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and gradually enter socialism and communism.
    Today, on this spring day of 1952, when China is leaping forward on the basis of its original achievements, I am following the Chinese people, climbing over one mountain after another, crossing one wave after another, and now entering this happy era. The more I live, the more I am filled with love. I love everything new, I love this vibrant motherland. I love the new people, the people who have become so good under the education of Mao Zedong. I see that our women have broken the feudal chains and have been liberated. They have shown themselves to be the same as men in various positions. I see that our children are also wearing red scarves and are receiving increasingly perfect education. I see that our old people are younger and full of hope for the world. I see that bad people have become good people, and labor has transformed them. We are no longer ragged, and our past pale faces are now full of blood. Chinese people are such beautiful and energetic people! Everywhere I see sunshine, and everywhere I feel the breath of life, the power of life, and the joy of life. The China that I once lamented and worried about is now full of joy everywhere, and I hear majestic songs everywhere. I once used my pen as a weapon to expose darkness and resist violence. Now I want to use my pen to sing the praises of everything in the new life. Although white hair has quietly climbed up to my temples, I feel as if life has just begun. I am as full of strength as China and the Chinese people. I seem to be in a realm of poetry all day long, and poetic sentences often surge into my heart. I want to create for China, I want to create for Chairman Mao. I often have a hope, let springtime China sprout and grow in my creation. Let me embrace springtime China well!

### 中国的春天——为苏联《文学报》而写

　　中国的春天
    ——为苏联《文学报》而写
    丁玲
    今天，是一九五二年春天的日子，是温和的阳光落在我书桌上的时候，是雪在悄悄融化的时候，是我阔步走在莫斯科广场的时候，是苏联的和平建设，高度的文化教育着我的时候，一个题目来到我的生活里面。它像淡黄色的阳光一样来到我的书案上，它清楚地美丽地被写在我的洁白的稿纸之上，它深刻地印入我的脑子里：啊，“中国的春天”，中国的春天啊！“中国”这个字不就是春天的化身么？当你想起中国的时候，你就看见无处不是新鲜，一切新事物都在绚丽的阳光之下，在温柔的和风之下发芽，蓬蓬勃勃地生长着，四处都感得到有一种不可压制的力量。这个力量正如果戈理所形容过的永远追不着的三驾马车，“地面在它底下飞扬着尘土，桥在发吼，一切都留在它的后面。”中国啊！中国正在奔向光明，奔向集体化，奔向毛泽东所指示的方向。
    “中国”，春天的中国，当我要为你讴歌的时候，从我的心中，好像升起了一股喷泉。我无法清理这些汹涌的热情，也来不及找到恰当的语言。我羡慕莫斯科大戏院的歌手，他们的确能把他们所要表现的，所应该表现的情感，倾泻无余，而又恰如其分地感染着人们的心。但我不管这些，我要欢呼！我要用我的全力欢呼：中国！人民的中国，毛泽东的中国啊！你带来了浓郁的春的气息，百花齐放；带来了生命，活泼有力而且是温暖和幸福！
    然而，当我为你讴歌的时候，为你的今天而讴歌的时候，我却不得不想起了你的昨天——严寒的冬天。你曾经用过多么艰难的步子，走了一个长长的历史阶段。你在几十年之中，把九百五十九万七千平方公里的土地，翻了一个身，你使五万万人都自由地站立起来，你打倒了几千年的封建制度，你在自己的领土上消灭了万恶的法西斯、帝国主义侵略者。你发扬了中国人民传统的美德，勤劳和勇敢；你又在肃清资产阶级所留下的腐化的庸俗的思想。中国是在斗争之中长大的，它还在斗争中。它为着它的理想，要战胜一切阻碍它前进的力量。
    现在，让我们回到一个古老的时代去吧。是果戈里的时代，是托尔斯泰的时代，是雪甫琴科的时代，是高尔基的童年的时代，我诞生了，诞生在中国的二十世纪的第一个十年中。虽说在俄罗斯已经是“暴风雨中的海燕”时期，有了列宁和斯大林领导的革命，但我出生的那个乡村，有什么不同于果戈理小说中，雪甫琴科的诗句中的情形呢？今天苏联的儿童，带着红领巾，走到儿童宫去学习科学和艺术。可是，是些什么东西在那时教育着我呢？当我还是一个应当捉迷藏和跳绳的幼年。没有什么旁的，只有封建地主家庭的黑暗腐朽和一切暴政，以及吃人的礼教。人们都是这样。人们得学习着忍受，锻炼坚强的意志，和储蓄着一切反抗的力量。我没有学习到什么，和我同时代的许多人一样，只学到一个思想：“旧的应该打毁，要砍断一切锁练！要冲破牢笼，为了光明，为了祖国，要做一个时代的、社会的、家庭的叛逆。”
    我也曾有过最可羡慕的青春。我应该充满了生的喜悦。我应该去跳舞、去滑冰。可是我有什么可以骄傲的呢？我只是像一个灯蛾，四处乱闯地飞，在黑暗中找寻光明。我甚至像一个老妇人，伏在地上，亲着潮湿的土地而哭泣。我觉得我的身子太轻了，负载不了这时代的苦痛。我曾在中国有名的杭州住过，这曾为外国诗人们所称赞过的地方。但我只能在山巅上高歌，以排遣我的抑郁。我甚至一点也感觉不到湖山的美丽。我也曾踯躅在旧北京的街头，如一个饕餮者贪馋地去吞食知识，想从西方文化中得到道路。我到今天还不愿仔细地去回忆那可悲的青年时代，应该像春花一样美丽的时代，却填满了忧愁，愤慨，挣扎，和反抗。然而我也应该多么的愉快，就在这样的年代中，我慢慢地走到了实际，我找到了真理，我和人民在一起，我站在一个多么可爱的人的麾下，毛泽东的麾下，充当一名小小的兵士。我和许多年青人一样，投身到热烈的革命的火焰当中。我们已经不再醉酒狂歌，而是举起革命的火把，唱着“起来，饥寒交迫的奴隶……”我们已经再不徘徊街头，而是以整齐的步伐，向反动者进军！我们是在毛泽东的指导下，开始了新的生命。曾经是多么困苦的，但走过来了。走在到光明去的大道上了。走到一个有伟大理想的大道上了。我们有马克思列宁主义，我们有斯大林，我们有毛泽东！
    中国人民在毛泽东的旗帜下，进行着复杂的、曲折的、异常艰苦的革命斗争。早在一九二六年间我们就曾经胜利过。可是绅士们再也不能酣睡了，他们发抖，他们叫嚣，连知识分子的脸也变白了。于是反动者们出卖了革命，出卖了人民胜利的果实。我们还能忘记一九二七年反动者所给我们的血的教训么？我们走到那里，那里都在逮捕和屠杀。四处都布满了白色恐怖。但是，啊！你，毛主席，你把红旗在井冈山上高高升起，你像一线阳光照在人们心头，你像黑夜中海上的灯塔，你指引着革命的方向，鼓舞了人们的斗志，你把希望和信心传播给人们。第二次国内革命战争在南北十几个省份野火般地燃烧起来了！革命的力量聚集起来了，革命的经验在被积累着。毛主席！你知道现在的这些老区的人们是多么地骄傲地谈着他们的过去，远远近近的人民又多么地向往着这革命的圣地呵！
    人们最不忘的，永远要被诗人们当着歌颂的题材的，是二万五千里的长征。铁的红军，从江西走到陕北，他们在崎岖的山路上，在惊险的浪涛中，在没有飞鸟也没有野草的雪岭上，在无边无际的草泽中行进。他们还通过一个少数民族区，又通过一个少数民族区。他们前边有敌人，后边有追兵，左边是反动派，右边是地主们的武装，可是没有什么东西可以阻挡这“铁流”。他们创造了一个奇迹又一个奇迹，当一个红军的兵士在月夜的草原上，想起了家乡的歌谣的时候，他跟着就想起了那睡在离他们不远的毛主席。他们就再也不能睡了，他们要守护这块土地。他们就要擦亮他们的枪，为着那个睡在他们不远地方的毛主席去杀敌。二万五千里的长征胜利了。这长征，这胜利，本身就是一首伟大的史诗。诗人们写了，留下了不少的诗篇，可是我们最爱读的，百读不厌的，写出了这气吞山河的长征的诗的，也还是这史诗最重要的创作者，毛泽东同志。我们愿意再温习一下这感情，我们愿意再朗诵这名诗：
    红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲；
    五岭逶迤腾细浪，乌蒙磅礴走泥丸。
    金沙浪拍悬崖暖；大渡桥横铁索寒；
    更喜岷山千里雪，三军过后尽开颜。
    中国革命的中心到了陕北，毛主席驻在延安。延安这小小的偏僻的山城，便成为世界的名城。抗日的统一战线在这里，抗日战争的胜利也在这里，革命的力量扩大和巩固在这里，马克思列宁主义的理论学习也在这里。延安啊！你曾经培养了多少干部、改造了多少人的思想。你那个大礼堂上，到今天还留着毛主席的题字：“实事求是”。所有在延安住过的人，都曾把你当一个家，唯一的家，都舍不得离开，离开了便永远怀念。陕北的人民，原就是长于歌唱的人民，自从有了毛主席，他们就更会歌唱了，更爱歌唱了。老农民孙万福见了毛主席，口诵了很多的诗，到现在这首歌唱遍了中国二十几个省：“高楼万丈平地起，盘龙卧虎高山顶，解放区的太阳是红又红，咱们的领袖毛泽东！”农民李增正唱出了所有人们心中的话：“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东，他为人民谋幸福，他是人民大救星。”这个歌，我在莫斯科听到过，在斯大林格勒听到过，在格鲁吉亚的首都梯比里斯也听到过。苏联的朋友们呵！我想你们会懂得我听了这陕北小调后所涌起的无尽的情感呵！
    抗日战争胜利了，解放战争胜利了，毛主席引导着我们从一个胜利到一个胜利。胜利的红旗，人民解放的红旗，和平的红旗从北往南插，从东又插到西。全中国解放了。新中国诞生了。从世界的东方，升起了曙光。全世界爱好和平的人们，拍手欢呼。中国的解放，给世界和平增加了多少力量。新中国是站在拥护和平的一面，站在苏联的一面，站在斯大林同志的这一面！
    那一天，一九四九年的十月一日。北京的天，蓝粉粉的，北京的人们穿着新衣，心里被烧着似的兴奋，心随着歌声，随着“万岁”的呼声飞向一个地方，天安门。人的河流也奔向天安门。天安门前的广场上是一片人的海，旗帜的海。红色的波浪翻滚着。人们重复着一个声音：“毛泽东万岁！”人人仰首望，天安门上也站满了人，人人在人丛中找，啊，那个高大的个子正是人民心上的人。呵！毛泽东！呵，毛主席！我们要永远跟着你，永远服务于人民，做一个不掉队的小兵。这一天，毛主席站出来了，人人都看见了他，他的声音响彻了天安门，响彻了北京，响彻了全中国，也响彻了全世界，他宣布了新中国的诞生，中央人民政府的成立。新的一切，便从这一天开始了，春天来了，中国的春天啊！
    在春天的中国，人民的生活，起着巨大的变化。天津有一个姚大娘，她曾经这样说过：“我，是一个穷苦老婆子，过去，在日本和国民党统治的时候，挨饿受冻，受尽欺凌侮辱。我男人蹬三轮车，摔坏了腿没钱治，我儿子卖冰，拉大车，赚来的钱不够全家人吃山芋面的，孩子们饿得哭，我生小孩两天没进一口汤水，饿得眼前冒金星，从炕上摔下来……”可是现在呢，她说：“解放后我们的日子一步登了天，我们吃的饱，穿的暖，再也不受气。我两个儿子都在工厂有了工作。”这个姚大娘在镇压反革命运动中，她逮住了一个特务。人民四处表扬了她，她便又说道：“这本来是我分内的事，可是人民却那么热情地拥护我，送我很多锦旗和礼物，请我到各处做报告，报上也登了我，我心里真说不出是怎么个滋味，我黑夜睡不着觉就想：这别是做梦吧，一个穷人还能有今天？连市长见了面还和我握握手。”她猛地坐了起来，看见满屋子悬挂的耀眼的镜子，彩色缤纷的锦旗，她忽然在这些中间看见一张像片，毛主席的像片，她于是兴奋地叹道：“这是真的呵！我有了今天不就是他，毛主席，共产党给我的么？”
    人民的生活改善了，人们的要求便也不同了。七十岁的老人们也每天挟着书本去到识字班，他们不愿落在年青人后边。湖南《大众报》在报纸上进行讨论土地改革，生产，时事问题，有一千个左右的农民很热情地写稿来参加讨论。全国农业劳动模范李顺达，农业生产合作社的旗帜，他在一九五一年的七月写信给毛主席，说的是他思想认识上的变化。他从一个普通农民懂得了城乡关系，懂得了工人阶级的领导作用，懂得了要关心政治，学习马克思列宁主义！农村里在大量地使用新的技术和新的农具，他们从变工互助慢慢地走到农业生产合作社。他们采用按劳动日计酬的办法，他们还逐渐地增加着公有的生产资料。而且在东北的北满草原上，在松花江的南岸，一个幸福的集体农庄出现了。庄员们按社会主义的原则，各尽所能，按劳取酬。他们一年一年地改进了管理方法，他们有丰富的收成。他们过着幸福的生活，他们每家有几间房子，房子里有电灯。他们有过节日的衣裳，书架上摆上了新书。他们读《社会发展史》，他们读《米丘林生平》，有人读《我们的目的是共产主义》，有人读《新文学教程》。这个完全理想的生活实现了，这个新闻正被全国农民注意着，他们正走向苏联农民那样幸福的环境。他们的灿烂的前程，就是我们大家的远景。赶上去呵！全中国的农民呵！这并不辽远，只要我们努力，我们很快便要同他们一样的哪。
    工业的成就，数不清。铁路增多了，江河畅流了。人们坐着宽敞的新的列车，飞驰着前进，车窗外展现出那么美丽的肥沃的辽阔的田野。车窗内人们听着音乐，读着书。“一定要把淮河修好”是毛主席的伟大号召，人民响应了这个号召，三百万人组成了一支雄壮的大军，他们要改变历史，要和自然斗争。工人把技术教育着农民，干部团结着技术专家，他们联合在一起展开了和洪水赛跑、和时间赛跑的激烈战斗。淮河修好了，千百年来为灾为害的祸水驯服了，他们有了闸，有了水库，还要有电气化。淮河将要成为一条美丽的河，一条可爱的河了。
    工人阶级摆脱了压迫，成为国家的领导阶级后，就自然发生了主人翁的感觉，树立起新的劳动态度，生产率一天天提高，一个新纪录压倒一个新纪录。他们提出劳动竞赛，他们订立爱国公约，他们展开了技术改进和合理化建议运动。劳动模范像雨后春笋地争着出来了。这短短的白纸写不尽他们的新的成绩，和那些光荣的名字。而且他们进工人学校了，进人民大学了，进中央文学研究所了。他们的文章登在《人民日报》上，登在《工人日报》上，登在《文艺报》上，登在《人民文学》上，他们在劳动人民文化宫上演了他们自己的戏，《不是蝉》这个戏自石家庄演到太原，又从北京演到上海，工人们爱看，作家们为他们开座谈会。他们要件件事都走在前边。
    人们在一切的运动中，迅速地变了样。人们抛弃了自私自利，生长了爱国主义和国际主义。抗美援朝了，人人都起来保卫和平，这里示威，那里游行。年轻人上了前线。老太太们也拿着簿子，征求人们在和平书上签名。我们的志愿军从一九五零年十月到现在一直是和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，不顾美帝国主义残酷的轰炸，和全世界人民反对的细菌武器的袭击。绿山烧成黑山，黑山又被炸成黄山，土地变色了，鲜明的红旗却屹立在阵地上。在最艰难的日子里，他们把来自祖国的香烟盒中的画片钉在战壕里，“祖国啊，我要为你战斗到底！”全中国的老老小小都明白，我们的战士最可爱。他们是人民的战士，是和平的保护者，他们永远忠于自己的神圣的职责。
    中国是胜利了，中国到处都充满了春天的阳光。中国正走在开满鲜花的道路上。喝水的要不忘挖井的人，是谁使我们这样？老百姓都在歌唱，是毛主席的恩情，是共产党的主张，是斯大林同志的教导和苏联人民的帮助。中苏两国永远的牢不可破的友谊，成了世界和平的保障。
    中国胜利了，中国四处都充满了春天的阳光，中国正走在开满鲜花的道路上。毛主席告诉我们：这只是万里长征走完了第一步。我们还要进行长期的复杂而艰苦的斗争，才能保住我们已得的胜利，才能获得更大的胜利。中国人民一定按照毛主席的指示，逐步进到社会主义和共产主义。
    今天，是一九五二年的春天的日子，是中国在原来的成就上更向前飞跃发展的时候，我跟随着中国人民，爬过了一座山，又一座山，渡过了一个浪潮又一个浪潮，到现在走进了这幸福的年代。我越活下去，我就越充满了爱。我爱新生的一切，我爱这朝气勃勃的祖国。我爱新的人民，在毛泽东教养下，一切都变得那样好的人民。我看见我们的妇女都打破了封建的锁链，得到了解放，她们在各种岗位上都显出了和男子们一样。我看见我们的孩子们也带着红领巾，受着日趋完美的教育。我看见我们的老年人都年轻了，满怀着对世界的希望。我看见坏人都变好了，劳动改造了他们。我们已不再褴褛，过去苍白的面孔上，现在已经充满了血色。中国人是多么漂亮而有精神的人物啊！我到处看见的都是阳光，我到处都感觉得生的气息，生的力量和生的喜悦。我曾经悲叹过的，忧愁过的中国，现在到处都是欢乐，到处都听到雄壮的歌。我曾经以我的笔作为武器，去揭露黑暗，反抗暴力，现在我要以我的笔去歌颂新生活的一切。虽然在我的鬓边，已经悄悄地爬上了白发，但我却觉得好像生命才开始。我同中国一样，同中国人民一样，有的是充沛的力量。我好像成天都在诗的境界，诗的句子常常涌到我的心中，我要为中国而创作，我要为毛主席而创作。我常有一个希望，让春天的中国在我的创作中发芽吧，生长吧。让我好好拥抱着春天的中国！
