Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on the 4th regarding the development of a campaign to increase production and practice economy in state-owned and public-owned factories and mines, along with the central tasks for May and June. The instructions require state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in Northeast China to launch a patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy starting in May, as the "Three-Anti" movement is about to basically conclude, and to strive to complete at least 50 percent of the annual plan by the end of the second quarter. The instructions require administrative leading bodies of enterprises at all levels, as well as local Party committees, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations, to provide specific guidance to factories and mines in the following tasks: (1) Clearly explain to the leading cadres and all employees of the factories and mines the various favorable conditions for carrying out a large-scale campaign to increase production and practice economy this year; (2) Must immediately shift the leadership focus on the industrial front to organizing production and capital construction. The work of recovering赃物 and closing cases in the "Three-Anti" campaign should be appropriately divided and combined with the completion of the overall task of increasing production and practicing economy; (3) Organize all employees to discuss the production, financial, and technical plans for this year, as well as plans on how to ensure the completion of capital construction tasks, improve quality, and reduce costs; (4) In order to ensure the smooth development of the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy and to complete the work of recovering 赃物 and closing cases of corrupt elements, Party committees, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should assist the administration in quickly doing a good job in promoting and assigning cadres, first equipping the cadre of the materials supply department with a complete set of staff and sound its institutions to ensure the supply of raw materials and tools. The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League within the enterprise should also, in coordination with the administration, reward employees who have consistently cherished state property and have made significant achievements, as well as those who have made inventions and creations in production and technology, both materially and in terms of honor, based on their contributions to the country, in addition to summarizing their specific experiences for promotion. Inventions and creations that have value for promotion throughout the Northeast may be reported to the Northeast People's Government for rewards.

    In order to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" campaign and quickly shift the leadership focus to production and capital construction, the Northeast Bureau instructed that before and during the movement, reporters and propagandists should be organized to repeatedly conduct in-depth educational work. Before the launch of the movement, the central content of the education is mainly: (1) Combining specific examples from each factory, systematically explain to the employees the seriousness of the harm of the three evils (corruption, waste, and bureaucracy) and the five poisons (bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of state property, shoddy work and cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence) to the country, so as to draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, thereby raising the consciousness of the employees politically and ideologically, so as to give full play to the working class's unlimited labor enthusiasm and responsibility for cherishing public property, and take opposition to corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and opposition to illegal bourgeois elements' ideological, political, and economic attacks on state enterprises as a regular task of struggle. (2) Conduct education among cadres (including technical personnel and staff) on the important significance of financial and economic work and the importance of cadre unity, overcome the current ideological fears of getting involved, the unwillingness to take responsibility in work, and certain disunity phenomena between newly promoted cadres and original cadres in factories and mines, so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of all staff members. The instruction pointed out that the content of the educational work should be appropriately changed during and after the launch of the movement. First of all, based on the specific ideological situation of the employees of each factory and mine, repeatedly explain the important significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and link the reduction of national commodity prices with the increase of employee wages this year to explain the relationship between improving production and improving employee lives, so as to inspire employee labor enthusiasm and give full play to their initiative and creativity. Secondly, in connection with the experience of last year's campaign to increase production and practice economy, use various forms to explain the significant role of learning and promoting advanced production experience and abiding by technical operating procedures in increasing output, improving product quality, and reducing costs, and mobilize all employees to find "窍门", create and promote advanced production experience and advanced working methods.

    The instruction pointed out that the class consciousness of the employees of state-owned and public-owned factories and mines in Northeast China has greatly improved after three years of mass movements. Therefore, the certain behaviors of waste and petty profiteering existing among the workers in factories and mines will no longer be corrected by launching a mass movement to confess and review, but by strengthening the education of cherishing state property in the ideological education stage of the campaign to increase production and practice economy and the "Three-Anti" construction stage.

    Regarding the issue of organizing all employees to discuss this year's national plan, the instruction pointed out: Before the discussion, the administrative leadership of the factory and mine must do sufficient preparation work. The first is to propose specific struggle goals for the enterprise and each workshop to exceed the national plan in terms of output, quality, and cost based on the completion of the plan in the first four months of this year, as well as specific plans to improve quality and reduce costs for each capital construction project unit, and point out the new potential of each factory, mine, workshop, and engineering unit, and then mobilize and organize all employees to use their brains and hands, think of ways, make suggestions, find "窍门", and formulate measures plans for units and individuals (i.e., specific plans for this unit and individual to increase production and practice economy this year), as well as specific measures, plans, steps, and methods for implementation, especially to seriously discuss the quality indicators stipulated in the national plan and make guarantee measures plans. The second is that the enterprise's leading organs should prepare supply plans for raw materials, tools, and other consumables required for increased production, as well as raw material conservation plans, and the enterprise's superior leading organs must assist factories and mines in solving difficulties in a timely manner to ensure supply. The third is that in the discussion of the plan, each factory and mine should propose a plan to create, promote, and learn advanced production experience and advanced working methods (including advanced management methods) according to the specific conditions of the enterprise, as well as specific implementation methods. Creators of various advanced experiences and employees who have made achievements in promoting advanced experiences must be given timely rewards so that the promotion of advanced experiences becomes a regular task. Fourth, in the discussion of the plan, the administrative leadership should fully study the various working conditions and welfare undertakings of the employees in the factory and mine, especially the ventilation and safety equipment in the factory building and other collective welfare undertakings that can be resolved. Concrete plans must be made for this and resolved seriously to improve working conditions and protect the health of employees. Based on the above content, the factory and mine administration and the trade union should sign contracts, revise patriotic covenants, organize competitions, and conduct regular inspections and summaries.

    中共中央东北局发出指示
    号召开展增产节约竞赛运动
    争取到第二季度末完成全年计划百分之五十
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】中共中央东北局四日发出关于国营公营厂矿开展增产节约竞赛运动与五、六月份中心工作的指示，要求东北各地国营公营厂矿在“三反”运动即将基本结束的情况下，从五月份起展开爱国主义增产节约竞赛运动，并争取到第二季度末最低限度要完成全年计划百分之五十。指示要求各级企业行政领导机关与各地党委、工会、青年团组织必须具体指导厂矿企业做好以下的工作：（一）要向厂矿的领导干部及全体职工讲清今年开展大规模增产节约运动的各种有利条件；（二）必须立即将工业战线上的领导重点转到组织生产与基本建设上来，“三反”的追赃结案工作，应作适当分工并在完成总的增产节约任务中来结合进行；（三）组织全体职工讨论今年的生产、财务、技术计划与讨论如何保证完成基本建设任务，提高质量降低成本的计划；（四）为使爱国增产节约运动顺利开展并完成对贪污分子的追赃结案工作，各级党委、工会、青年团要协助行政，迅速作好提拔与配备干部的工作，先将材料供应部门的干部配备齐全，健全其机构，以保证原材料和工具的供应。企业内党、工会、青年团还要协同行政，在发动运动前后，对一贯爱护国家财产有显著成绩，在生产上、技术上有发明创造的职工，除总结其具体经验加以推广外，并根据其对国家的贡献大小，给以物质上、名誉上的奖励。其发明创造中有在全东北推广价值者，可呈报东北人民政府给以奖励。
    为了巩固“三反”成果，并把领导重点迅速转到生产基本建设上来，东北局指示说：在运动前与运动中要组织报告员、宣传员反复进行深入的教育工作。运动发动之前，教育的中心内容主要是：（一）结合每个厂的具体事例，系统地在职工中讲清三害
    （贪污、浪费、官僚主义）、五毒（行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报）对于国家危害的严重性，以划清工人阶级与资产阶级的界限，从而在政治上、思想上把职工的觉悟提高一步，以发挥工人阶级无限的劳动积极性与爱护公共财物的责任心，并将反对贪污、浪费、官僚主义与反对不法资产阶级分子向国家企业在思想上、政治上和经济上的进攻，做为经常的斗争任务。（二）在干部中（包括技术人员与职员）进行关于财经工作的重要意义与干部团结的重要性的教育，克服目前厂矿企业中某些干部思想上怕沾包，工作中不敢负责，以及新提拔干部与原有干部之间某些不团结现象，以发挥所有工作人员的积极性。指示指出，在运动发动中与发动之后，教育工作的内容应有适当的改变，首先应根据各厂矿职工的具体思想情况，反复说明增产节约的重要意义，要联系全国物价的降低与今年职工工薪的提高，说明提高生产与改善职工生活的关系，以启发职工劳动热忱，发挥其积极性、创造性；其次要联系去年增产节约运动的经验，利用各种形式，说明学习与推广先进生产经验、遵守技术操作规程对增加产量、提高产品质量、降低成本的重大作用，发动全体职工找“窍门”，创造与推广先进生产经验与先进工作方法。
    指示指出：东北国营和公营厂矿职工三年来经过历次群众性运动，阶级觉悟已有很大提高，因此厂矿内工人群众中所存在的某些浪费与占小便宜的行为不再采取群众运动的方式发动坦白与检讨，而在增产节约运动中，在“三反”建设阶段的思想教育中，加强其爱护国家财产的教育加以纠正。
    关于组织全体职工讨论今年国家计划的问题，指示指出：在讨论前，厂矿行政领导方面要做好充分的准备工作。第一是根据今年四个月完成计划的情况，提出本企业单位以及各车间今年在产量、质量以及成本上超过国家计划的具体奋斗目标，以及基本建设每个工程单位提高质量、降低成本的具体计划，指出每个厂矿车间与工程单位新的潜力所在，然后动员与组织全体职工动脑动手，想办法，出主意，找“窍门”，制订单位与个人的措施计划（即本单位与个人今年增产节约的具体计划），以及执行的具体措施、方案、步骤与方法，特别要认真讨论国家计划中规定的质量指标，做出保证措施计划。第二是企业的领导机关应根据增产所需，做好原材料、工具及其它消耗物料的供应计划，以及原材料的节约计划，企业的上级领导机关须协助厂矿及时解决困难，保证供应。第三是每个厂矿在讨论计划中，应根据本企业的具体情况，提出创造、推广与学习先进生产经验及先进工作方法（包括先进的管理工作方法）的计划，以及具体实现的办法。对各种先进经验的创造者，推广先进经验有成绩的职工必须给予及时的奖励，以便把推广先进经验变成为经常的工作。第四，在讨论计划中，行政领导方面要充分地研究厂矿内职工的各种劳动条件与福利事业的情况，特别是厂房内的通风安全设备的情况及其它可能解决的集体福利事业，对此必须做出具体计划，认真加以解决，以改善工作条件，保护职工身体健康。根据上述内容，厂矿行政与工会应签订合同，修订爱国公约，组织竞赛运动，定期检查总结。
