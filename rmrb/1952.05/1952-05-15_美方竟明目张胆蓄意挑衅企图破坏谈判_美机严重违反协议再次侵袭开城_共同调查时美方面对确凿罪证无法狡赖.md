Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th—At 2:40 AM on the 14th, US military aircraft once again seriously violated the agreement, intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone for a total of 55 minutes.

After intruding into the airspace over Kaesong, US aircraft dropped a large number of flares. According to reporters on the scene, as many as 25 flares were dropped, illuminating the entire city as if it were daytime. Then, US aircraft circled at low altitude and strafed the area.

This serious incident is clearly a blatant and deliberate act of provocation by the US side, attempting to sabotage the armistice negotiations. However, such threatening tactics by the US side have long been bankrupt in the past, and will never have any impact on the Korean-Chinese delegation now or in the future. On the contrary, it only further exposes the true face of the US side's deliberate sabotage of the negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th—At 11:30 AM on the 14th, our side's liaison officer, Colonel Chai Chengwen, notified the US side's chief liaison officer, Colonel Kinney, that from 2:40 AM to 3:35 AM on the morning of the 14th, US military aircraft violated the agreement by strafing and dropping a large number of flares over the Kaesong neutral zone, and requested that Kinney immediately go to the scene for investigation. Kinney attempted to avoid an immediate on-site investigation of this serious violation of the agreement, saying that he first needed to obtain "radar reconnaissance" materials, and then claiming that he needed "concrete evidence" before going to the scene for investigation. Colonel Chai Chengwen pointed out that the US side's delaying and ambiguous attitude was inconsistent with the precedent of immediate joint investigation by both sides in previous incidents of US violation of the agreement. Colonel Chai also made it clear that the US side could see the traces left by the US military aircraft violating the agreement and invading the neutral zone during the on-site investigation. Kinney had no choice but to agree to a joint investigation at 2:30 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 14th—The liaison officers of both sides jointly investigated the incident of US aircraft violating the agreement by intruding into the Kaesong neutral zone to strafe and drop flares on the morning of the 14th. After seeing the undeniable evidence, the US side's chief liaison officer, Kinney, had to admit, "The ordnance and weapons seen today are clearly those used by the United Nations forces." However, Kinney still claimed that he needed to check their "radar records" before drawing a conclusion on the responsibility for the incident. Our side's liaison officer, Colonel Chai Chengwen, solemnly pointed out that the responsibility for this matter is already evidenced beyond doubt and cannot be questioned.

The reason Kinney had to admit that the ordnance and weapons were those of the "United Nations forces" was because the evidence was impossible for any trickster to distort. Among the scattered shell casings found by our side and jointly investigated in the Kaesong neutral zone and on both sides of the road from Kaesong to Panmunjom, many had clear English markings. Some shell casings were marked: "U.S. Navy Parachute Flare," some were marked: "U.S. Navy Ammunition Depot," and some were marked: "Manufactured by Westhigh Co., Ohio." Kinney himself also saw the machine gun shell casings and fragments from the US aircraft strafing in a wheat field in the Kaesong neutral zone. Moreover, Kaesong residents Li Guozheng and Cui Jichun, who were designated by Kinney himself as witnesses, also provided irrefutable facts that they heard and saw with their own eyes.

The joint investigation by both sides started at 2:30 PM and ended at 5:45 PM. The liaison officers of both sides visited a total of ten investigation sites.

    美方竟明目张胆蓄意挑衅企图破坏谈判
    美机严重违反协议再次侵袭开城
    共同调查时美方面对确凿罪证无法狡赖
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日上午二时四十分，美方军用飞机又一次严重违反协议，侵入开城中立区，先后达五十五分钟之久。
    美机在侵入开城上空后，投掷了大批照明弹，据记者目睹，先后达二十五枚之多，全市照耀如同白昼，接着美机低空盘旋，并进行扫射。
    此次严重事件，显系美方明目张胆的有意挑衅行为，企图以此破坏停战谈判。但美方的这种威胁伎俩，过去早已破产，现在和将来也绝不会对朝中代表团产生任何影响，相反地，只是更进一步暴露了美方蓄意破坏谈判的真面目。
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日上午十一时半我方联络官柴成文上校通知美方首席联络官肯尼上校，十四日晨二时四十分到三时三十五分，美方军用飞机违反协议在开城中立区上空进行扫射并投掷大批照明弹，要求肯尼立即前往现场进行调查。肯尼企图避开立即进行此一严重违反协议事件的现场调查，说什么首先要取得“雷达侦察”的材料，然后又说什么要“具体证据”，才前往现场调查。柴成文上校指出：美方这种迟延和暧昧的态度，是不符合历次美方破坏协议事件、双方立即共同进行调查的惯例的。柴上校并明确指出：美方在进行现场调查时，即可看到美方军用飞机违反协议侵犯中立区所遗留的痕迹。肯尼才不得不同意下午二时半进行共同调查。
    【新华社开城十四日电】双方联络官今日共同调查了十四日晨美机违反协议侵入开城中立区进行扫射以及投掷照明弹的事件。美方首席联络官肯尼在看到无可置辩的证据后，不得不承认：“今天看到的军火武器都清楚地是联合国军所使用的。”但肯尼仍诡称要查对他们的“雷达纪录”，才能作出事件责任的结论。我方联络官柴成文上校严正指出：这一件事的责任何属，已经是证据确凿，无可置疑。
    肯尼之所以不得不承认军火武器是“联合国军”的这一事实，是由于这些证据是任何狡诈者都不可能歪曲的，在我方已发现并共同进行调查的散在开城中立区及开城通向板门店的通道两旁的弹壳中，多有显明的英文标志，有的弹壳上写着：“美国海军降落伞照明弹”，有的写着：“美国海军军火库”，有的写着：“俄亥俄州威斯维勤基果尔公司”制造。肯尼在开城中立区内的一片麦地上也亲眼看到美机扫射的机枪弹壳弹片。而由肯尼自己指定作为人证的开城居民李国正、崔继淳，也都提供了他们耳闻目睹的铁的事实。
    双方共同调查自下午二时三十分开始至五时四十五分结束。双方联络官曾往调查的现场共十处。
