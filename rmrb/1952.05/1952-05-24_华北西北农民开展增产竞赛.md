North and Northwest farmers are launching a production increase competition, driven by model workers and mutual aid cooperative organizations, and it is developing enthusiastically. Broad masses of farmers in the North China provinces have joined the large-scale patriotic production increase competition movement. In Shanxi Province, by the beginning of May, over 50,000 mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives were leading the majority of farmers in participating in the competition. During the sowing season in the Changzhi Special District, 80% of farming households were involved, forming a district-wide, vertically and horizontally linked patriotic production increase competition network. The "hundred village, thousand group, ten thousand household" production increase movement in Chahar Province also greatly exceeded its original plan. In Pingyuan Province, more than 3,300 mutual aid teams (cooperatives) and nearly 23,000 farming households are participating in the patriotic production increase competition. In Hebei Province, model workers at the province, county, and village levels are taking the lead, with thousands of people responding to the challenge from provincial model worker Zhang Xishun and others, and challenging their respective districts and villages. In the Yuansui Province, the movement is gradually unfolding in the struggle to overcome spontaneous tendencies. The development of patriotic production increase competitions in various regions has greatly promoted spring plowing and sowing work. By the beginning of May, the sowing area of various crops in Hebei Province had reached 50% to 80%. In Pingyuan Province, the sowing of cotton and sorghum has ended, and millet and peanuts are being planted. Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces, which suffered from severe drought last year and had a later sowing season, are expected to complete large-field sowing due to better spring plowing preparation. In the competition, farmers in various regions are actively investing in the land, expanding production, and improving farming techniques, which provides a strong guarantee for increasing yield per unit area this year. This year, the land investment of model workers such as Qu Yaoli and Geng Changsuo has increased compared to the original plan. Base fertilizer for cotton fields in Pingyuan Province has doubled compared to last year. In Nie Village, Laishui County, Hebei, 140 farming households have made production increase plans and purchased an additional 25,200 jin of fine fertilizer. In the Yuncheng Special District of Shanxi, the sowing area of improved varieties has doubled compared to last year, and cultivation is more meticulous than last year. Qu Yaoli's cotton field close planting method and techniques such as seed soaking and seed mixing have been widely promoted. Since the beginning of spring, farmers in wheat-producing areas in various provinces have carried out weeding and topdressing. In April, wheat aphids caused widespread damage throughout the region. After mobilizing farmers for emergency control, most of them have been eliminated, and a bumper wheat harvest is expected throughout the region.

The main reason for the above significant achievements in the patriotic production increase movement in North China this spring is that the provincial people's governments generally attach importance to leading the competition movement, and have sent tens of thousands of cadres to the countryside to guide and inspect spring plowing. However, in some areas, the competition movement is still limited to a few model workers and mutual aid teams, and has failed to motivate the majority of farmers to participate. In some other areas, there are phenomena of coercion, commandism and formalism in the movement, so the movement becomes silent after the challenges are issued. Currently, these areas are paying attention to studying and solving the above problems in order to promote the further widespread and in-depth development of the movement.

Xinhua News Agency Report: Farmers in the northwest provinces and farmers in minority areas widely launched an increase-production competition. The first to respond to the comprehensive increase-production competition movement initiated by agricultural production cooperatives such as Li Shunda's were twenty-four mutual aid groups linked together in Xiwangmang Village in Chang'an County, Shaanxi, the Wangjiaping model village in Suide, and six mutual aid groups including Zhang Mingliang in Xingping County, Li Yinting in Baishui County, and Shi Chungkui in Qinghai. At the same time, they challenged farmers and mutual aid groups in the northwest. Labor models and advanced mutual aid groups at the provincial and county levels also actively participated in the competition. Under their leadership, the provinces promptly launched regional chain competitions. Farmers in wheat-producing areas also generally responded to the challenge from Shi Anfu mutual aid group in Hancheng County, Shaanxi. The 173 mutual aid groups participating in the competition in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi aim to increase the yield per unit area of 10,000 mu of wheat fields by 30% this year, and their fertilizer application has generally increased by 40% compared to last year. The Uyghur Amuti mutual aid group in Hami County, Xinjiang, also participated in the Shi Anfu wheat competition. While responding to Qu Yaoli's challenge, cotton-producing areas launched a movement to learn Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience. In Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, 345 mutual aid groups, due to breaking the conservative thinking of their members during the learning process, revised their original increase-production competition conditions, increasing the yield per unit area by 30% to 40% compared to the original plan. The Uyghur cotton planting expert Baikeli in Turpan County, Xinjiang, and the mutual aid group he leads, also responded to the challenge from Qu Yaoli and other mutual aid groups, and challenged cotton farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

The Northwest Military and Political Committee and the people's governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Provinces have respectively issued instructions on carrying out the patriotic production increase competition movement, and have successively sent more than 700 cadres to go deep into the countryside to help formulate production increase competition plans and strengthen specific guidance and inspection of production.

    华北西北农民开展增产竞赛
    华北、西北农业爱国增产竞赛运动，在劳动模范和互助合作组织带动下，正热烈展开。华北各省广大农民已卷入规模宏大的爱国增产竞赛运动中。山西省到五月初，已有五万多互助组与农业生产合作社等带动广大农民参加了竞赛。长治专区在播种期间，百分之八十的农户投入运动，组成全区纵横连环的爱国增产竞赛网。察哈尔省的“百村、千组、万户”的增产运动也大大超过原计划。平原省已有三千三百多个互助组（社），近二万三千农户参加爱国增产竞赛。河北省、县、村劳动模范层层带头，向全省劳动模范张希顺等应战并向本区、村挑战的已有数千人。远绥省在克服自流倾向斗争中，运动亦已逐渐展开。各地爱国增产竞赛的开展，大大推动了春耕播种工作。至五月初，河北省各种作物播种面积，已达百分之五十到八十。平原省棉花、高粱播种已结束，正种谷子、花生。去年苦旱而播种季节又较迟的察哈尔、绥远两省由于春耕准备工作较好，大田播种即可结束。各地农民在竞赛中积极向土地投资，扩大生产和改进耕作技术，这就对今年单位面积产量的提高，提供了有力的保证。今年曲耀离、耿长锁等劳动模范的土地投资，都比原计划提高。平原省棉田基肥，比去年增加一倍。河北涞水聂村一百四十户农民做了增产计划，增购细肥两万五千二百斤。山西运城专区良种播种面积比去年扩大了两倍，耕作都比去年精细。曲耀离棉田密植法和浸种、拌种等技术已普遍推广。各省产麦区农民，入春以来，多进行了锄苗，追肥。四月份全区麦蚜普遍为害，经发动农民紧急除治，已大部消灭，全区麦田丰收可望。
    华北全区今春爱国增产运动获得以上重大成绩的主要原因，是各省人民政府一般重视对竞赛运动的领导，前后派了数万干部下乡领导和检查春耕。但是，有的地区竞赛运动还停留在少数劳动模范和互助组之间，未能带动广大农民投入竞赛。还有一部分地区在运动中有强迫命令和形式主义的现象，因而挑战过后，运动即无声无息。目前这些地区对以上问题正注意研究解决，以推动运动进一步普遍深入展开。
    西北各省农民以及少数民族地区的农民广泛展开增产竞赛。首先响应李顺达等农业生产合作社所发起的全面增产竞赛运动的，有陕西长安县西王蟒村二十四个互助组联组、绥德王家坪模范村以及兴平县张明亮，白水县李荫亭和青海史春奎等六个互助组，同时他们又向西北各地农民和互助组挑战。省、县各级的劳动模范和先进互助组也纷纷参加竞赛，在他们的带动下，各省及时地展开了区域性的连环竞赛。在小麦产区的农民也普遍地向陕西韩城县史安福互助组应战。参加竞赛的陕西关中地区一百七十三个互助组的一万亩麦田，今年单位面积产量要争取提高百分之三十，他们的施肥量普遍较去年增加百分之四十。新疆哈密县维吾尔族阿木提互助组也参加史安福小麦竞赛。棉产区在响应曲耀离挑战的同时，展开了学习曲耀离先进植棉经验的运动。陕西省长安县三百四十五个互助组，由于在学习过程中，打破了组员们的保守思想，纷纷修订了原来的增产竞赛条件，使单位面积产量较原计划提高了百分之三十到四十。新疆吐鲁番县维吾尔植棉能手白克里和他领导的互助组，也向曲耀离等互助组应战，并向新疆各族棉农挑战。
    西北军政委员会和陕、甘、宁、青各省人民政府已分别颁布开展爱国增产竞赛运动的指示，并先后派出干部七百余人，深入农村帮助订立增产竞赛计划，加强对生产的具体领导和检查。
