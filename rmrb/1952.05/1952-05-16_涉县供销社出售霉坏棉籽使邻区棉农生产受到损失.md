    Shexian Supply and Marketing Cooperative Sells Moldy Cottonseeds, Causing Losses to Cotton Farmers in Neighboring Areas

    Editor: In order to promote superior cotton varieties and help cotton farmers increase cotton yield per unit area, the North Danche Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Fourth District of Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, sent people to the Shexian Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province twice in March and April this year to purchase 1,021 jin of the "Si" character cotton superior variety. Cotton farmers welcomed these seeds very much. Model worker Jia Xinyu of Wanli Village traveled 20 li to buy them; the Duan Mao Hai Agricultural Production Cooperative of North Danche also planted 5 mu with the "Si" character cotton seeds; Shang Lianhu planted two and a half mu of "Si" character cotton in his three mu cotton field. A total of 127 mu of good land in six villages in the district was selected to plant "Si" character cotton. But surprisingly, the cotton seedlings planted with local cotton seeds have all emerged from the soil, while the "Si" character cotton seeds have not sprouted at all. At first, the masses thought that the "Si" character cotton seeds might emerge later and went to the fields to check several times a day. Later, they found that these cotton seeds had rotted in the soil and could not germinate. After inspection, it was discovered that these cotton seeds were moldy old cotton seeds. This incident aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Cotton farmers said, "Instead of increasing production, we have to reduce production. How can we fulfill the cotton pre-purchase contracts we signed with the supply and marketing cooperative!" At present, the local government has organized cotton farmers to replant the 127 mu of cotton fields where the seedlings have not emerged.

    We believe that the business personnel of the North Danche Supply and Marketing Cooperative should be criticized for not carefully inspecting the cotton seeds when they purchased them from the Shexian Supply and Marketing Cooperative. However, it is a serious mistake for the Shexian Supply and Marketing Cooperative to deceive the masses with bad cotton seeds. This incident has affected spring plowing and production, and damaged the government's prestige among the masses. We believe that the Shexian Supply and Marketing Cooperative should make a profound self-criticism and provide a public response.

### 涉县供销社出售霉坏棉籽使邻区棉农生产受到损失

    涉县供销社出售霉坏棉籽使邻区棉农生产受到损失
    编辑同志：山西平顺县四区北耽车村供销合作社为了推广优良棉种，帮助棉农提高棉花单位面积产量，曾在今年三、四月间，两次派人到河北省涉县供销合作社购买斯字棉优良品种一千零二十一斤。棉农很欢迎这些种籽。湾里村劳动模范贾新玉跑了二十里路去买；北耽车段毛孩农业生产合作社也用斯字棉种种了五亩；尚连虎三亩棉田就种了二亩半斯字棉，全区六个村共选出一百二十七亩好地播种斯字棉。但令人奇怪的是，种了本地棉籽的棉苗都已全部出土，而斯字棉种却全未出苗。起初，群众还认为斯字棉种可能出得迟，一天跑到地里看好几次。后来发现这些棉籽已烂在土内，不能出芽了。经过检查，才知道这些棉籽是发了霉的旧棉籽。这件事，引起群众极大不满。棉农说：“不能丰产还得减产，咱和供销社订的预购棉花合同叫怎样执行呀！”目前当地政府已组织棉农把未出芽的一百二十七亩棉田重新进行补种。
    我们认为北耽车供销社的业务员到涉县供销社购买棉籽，不亲自细心检验，固然应该受到批评，但是涉县供销社用坏了的棉籽欺骗群众，却是严重的错误。这件事影响了春耕生产，损害了政府在群众中的威信。我们认为涉县供销社应做深刻检讨，并公开答复。陈成富　之　庆　张春锁王振勋　韩乃河　王锁成“
