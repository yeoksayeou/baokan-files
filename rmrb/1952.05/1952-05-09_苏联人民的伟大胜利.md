    The Great Victory of the Soviet People
    Soviet Union, Geliebofu
    Progressive people all over the world are today celebrating the seventh anniversary of the victory of the Soviet people and their armed forces over German imperialism.
    This victory of world-historical significance is unprecedented in scale in terms of the Soviet people’s war against the fascist bandits to defend their great socialist motherland.
    In the long period before the war, American and British imperialists gave enormous assistance to Hitler in strengthening and expanding the foundation of his war industry, in implementing various military measures aimed at aggression, and they tried every possible means to provoke German fascism to invade the Soviet Union.
    On June 22, 1941, millions of well-trained and modernly equipped Hitlerian troops perfidiously invaded Soviet territory.
    Fascist Germany, as the main aggressive force of international imperialism, attempted to restore the capitalist order in the Soviet Union and turn the Soviet people into its slaves. According to the plan drawn up by the German fascist bandits for the invasion of the Soviet Union, they thought that the war could be ended in a "lightning" time, that is, the predetermined goal could be achieved in two and a half months, and they could advance to the Urals.
    However, facts immediately proved the extreme madness and adventurousness of these plans. The entire Soviet people, under the wise leadership and encouragement of Stalin and the Bolshevik Party, rose up to fight the Great Patriotic War.
    The "blitzkrieg" plan to invade the Soviet Union was completely bankrupt in the first battle of the Great Patriotic War. The fascist army, which boasted of its westward victories, suffered a disastrous defeat near Moscow and was driven far away from the Soviet capital.
    This disastrous defeat of the German army eloquently proved the unparalleled superiority of Soviet military science over fascist military theories, demonstrating the excellent skills and noble qualities of Soviet soldiers, as well as the mass heroism inherent in the Soviet army.
    In 1942, the German fascist high command adopted a new offensive. Hitler's troops launched a fierce attack on Stalingrad, a strategic military location on the Volga River, where the Red Army had defeated the White Guards during the Civil War.
    The outcome of the Battle of Stalingrad made everyone who hated fascism and opposed enslavement rejoice. Three hundred and thirty thousand well-equipped elite troops of German fascists were surrounded and completely annihilated by the Soviet army. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the Battle of Stalingrad was the starting point of the decline of the German fascist army.
    In 1943, near Kursk, the Soviet army gave the enemy another major blow, when Hitler's troops tried once again to reverse the situation to their advantage. The annihilation battle near Kursk brought the German fascist army to a crisis.
    After that, the Soviet army continuously struck the enemy, eliminating its manpower and equipment, surrounding and annihilating a large number of enemy troop formations. In 1944, Hitler's troops suffered ten devastating blows. As a result of these blows, the Soviet army liberated Soviet territory from the invaders and pushed military operations into enemy territory.
    On April 16, 1945, the Soviet army began the last battle of the Great Patriotic War - the Battle of Berlin. It ended with the glorious victory of the Soviet army: on May 8, 1945, fascist Germany surrendered unconditionally.
    The heroic war of the Soviet people and their armed forces against the fascist bandits, which lasted for one thousand four hundred and seventeen days, was unprecedented in scale. In order to achieve victory in this war, the sacrifices made by the Soviet people were inestimable, and in order to defend their motherland—the world's first socialist country—the Soviet people accomplished a great cause on the front lines and in the rear.
    This heroic war against the German fascist army was actually carried out by the Soviet army alone. In order to achieve the goal of weakening the Soviet Union in the war, the American and British imperialists deliberately delayed the opening of the second battlefield in Europe, thus shamelessly violating their promises. When the ruling groups in Washington and London saw that the Soviet army was about to defeat Hitler's Germany and liberate European countries from fascist enslavement by its own strength alone, the American and British troops landed in Europe. However, even after landing, they did not bring any anxiety to Hitler's high command, although Hitler had only a small number of troops and relatively weak combat effectiveness on the Western Front at that time.
    In addition, as is well known, American monopoly capitalists supplied German fascists with strategic raw materials and weapons during the war, thus strengthening its war potential. According to repeated disclosures in newspapers, the US government was not unaware of this matter.
    However, the various conspiracies of the American and British imperialists to weaken the Soviet Union failed. The powerful socialist country became even stronger after fighting the war against German fascism alone. In the war against German fascism, the Soviet socialist system and state system were victorious, and the Soviet people and their armed forces were victorious.
    Immediately after the Soviet army defeated German fascism, it also eliminated the main military force of Japanese imperialism - the Kwantung Army. These two victories are of world-historical significance. It opened up the path for those countries liberated by the Soviet army from the enslavement of German and Japanese fascists to build a new life. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Workers' Party, the people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania are now confidently marching along the road of building socialism. The establishment of the German Democratic Republic marks a turning point in European history.
    Molotov wrote: "It must be acknowledged the world significance of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which shattered the foundation of imperialism in Asia and opened up a new road to freedom and happiness for the great Chinese people."
    After the Japanese imperialist army in Manchuria and Korea was annihilated in August 1945, the Soviet army not only liberated Korea from the oppression of Japanese imperialism, but also gave the Korean people the opportunity to establish their own independent and democratic country. However, not all the people were able to take advantage of this opportunity, because the American imperialists in South Korea hindered the process of democratic reform. What is more serious is that they even launched a war of aggression against the North Korean people and deliberately occupied the entire territory of Korea, turning it into an advanced base for invading the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. But the calculations of American imperialism were wrong. The Korean people and their armed forces, in coordination with the Chinese People's Volunteers, resolutely fought back against the mad invaders. Now, the heinous bacteriological warfare being waged by the American aggressors will also be crushed by the determined and steadfast Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The just struggle of the Korean people is not isolated. Progressive people all over the world, with the Soviet people at their head, hundreds of millions of freedom-loving people, stand on the side of the Korean people.
    More than one-third of the world's population has formed a powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union. Hundreds of millions of honest people in capitalist countries support this camp. This support is manifested in the fact that the ranks of peace supporters are constantly growing and expanding in the struggle to resolutely oppose the aggressive policy of American imperialism and its conspiracy to provoke a new world war.
    While the contradictions within the imperialist camp are becoming increasingly acute, the unity and friendship of the people in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism are growing stronger. The leader of this camp is the great Comrade Stalin, the standard-bearer of world peace.

    苏联人民的伟大胜利
    苏联  格列波夫
    全世界的进步人类今天都在庆祝苏联人民及其武装部队战胜德国帝国主义的七周年。
    这个世界历史性的胜利，从苏联人民所进行的反对法西斯强盗、捍卫伟大社会主义祖国的战争的规模来说，是空前的。
    在战前的长时期中，美英帝国主义者曾在希特勒加强和扩大战争工业基础的计划上，在他实行各种旨在进行侵略的军事性措施上，给以巨大的援助，并千方百计地挑拨德国法西斯侵犯苏联。
    一九四一年六月二十二日，数百万训练有素的近代化装备的希特勒军队，背信弃义地侵入了苏联国土。
    作为国际帝国主义的主要侵略力量的法西斯德国，企图在苏联恢复资本主义秩序，并把苏联人民变为自己的奴隶。按照德国法西斯强盗所拟定的侵苏计划，他们以为在“闪电的”时间内就可以结束战争，即用两个半月的时间就可以达到预定的目标，并进抵乌拉尔。
    然而，事实立刻证明了这些计划的极端疯狂性和冒险性。全体苏联人民，在英明的斯大林和布尔什维克党的领导和鼓舞下，起来进行了伟大的卫国战争。
    侵苏的“闪电战”计划，在伟大卫国战争的第一次会战中就宣告完全破产。吹嘘西进胜利的法西斯大军，在莫斯科近郊首先遭到惨败，并从苏联首都被远远地赶走。
    德军这一惨败，雄辩地证明了苏联军事科学较法西斯军事理论具有无比优越性，显示了苏联战士的优秀技能和崇高品质以及苏军所固有的群众性英雄主义。
    一九四二年，德国法西斯统帅部采取了新的攻势。希特勒军队向斯大林格勒发动猛攻，这里是伏尔加河畔的军事要地，内战时期红军曾在此击溃白卫军。
    斯大林格勒会战的结局，使一切痛恨法西斯主义和反对奴役的人们额手称庆。三十三万德国法西斯的装备充足的精锐部队被苏军包围并全部歼灭。斯大林同志曾指出，斯大林格勒会战是德国法西斯军队开始没落的起点。
    一九四三年，在库尔斯克附近，苏军又给敌人以第二次重大打击，当时希特勒军队曾再次企图扭转战局使之对自己有利。库尔斯克附近的歼灭战使德国法西斯军队面临危机。
    其后，苏军又接连不断地打击敌人，消灭它的有生力量和装备，包围和聚歼大量的敌军兵团。在一九四四年，希特勒军队遭受到十次歼灭性打击。这些打击的结果，使苏军从侵略者手中解放了苏联国土，并把军事行动推移到敌人的领土上去。
    一九四五年四月十六日，苏军开始了伟大卫国战争的最后一次战役——柏林大会战。它以苏军的光辉胜利而告结束：一九四五年五月八日，法西斯德国全部无条件投降。
    持续一千四百十七天的英雄的苏联人民及其武装部队反对法西斯强盗的战争，其规模是史无前例的。为了在这一战争中取得胜利，苏联人民所付出的牺牲代价是不可估计的，为了保卫自己的祖国——世界上第一个社会主义国家，苏联人民在前线和后方完成了伟大的事业。
    这个反对德国法西斯军队的英勇的战争实际上是苏军独自进行的。美英帝国主义者为了达到在战争中削弱苏联的目的，故意拖延欧洲第二战场的开辟，从而厚颜无耻地违背了自己的诺言。当华盛顿和伦敦的统治集团眼看着苏军仅靠自己的力量就要把希特勒德国打垮并从法西斯奴役下解放欧洲各国时，美英军队才在欧洲登陆。可是，即使在登陆以后，他们也不曾给希特勒统帅部带来什么焦虑不安，虽然当时希特勒在西线只有少量军队且战斗力颇弱。
    此外，如所周知，美国独占资本家在战争期间曾以战略原料和武器供给德国法西斯，因此加强了它的战争潜力。根据报章不止一次的透露，美国政府对此事并不是不知道。
    然而，美英帝国主义者企图削弱苏联的种种阴谋都失败了。强大的社会主义国家经过单独地和德国法西斯进行战争以后，是更加强大了。在反对德国法西斯的战争中，苏维埃社会制度和国家制度获得胜利，苏联人民及其武装部队获得胜利。
    苏军战胜德国法西斯以后，紧接着又消灭了日本帝国主义的主要军事力量——关东军。这两个胜利是具有世界历史性意义的。它替那些被苏军从德、日法西斯奴役下解放出来的国家开辟了建设新生活的道路。在共产党和工人党的领导下，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的人民，如今正满怀信心地沿着建设社会主义的道路迈进。德意志民主共和国的成立，标志着欧洲历史的转折点。
    莫洛托夫写道：“必须承认中华人民共和国成立的世界意义，它打垮了帝国主义在亚洲的基础，为伟大的中国人民开辟了走向自由与幸福的新道路。”
    一九四五年八月日本帝国主义在满洲和朝鲜的军队被歼后，苏军不仅把朝鲜从日本帝国主义的压迫下解放出来，并且使朝鲜人民有机会建立自己的独立与民主的国家。然而不是全国人民都得以利用这个机会，因为在南朝鲜的美帝国主义者阻碍民主改革的进行。更严重的是，他们竟发动了侵略战争反对北朝鲜人民，并蓄意霸占朝鲜的全部国土，把它变为侵犯中华人民共和国和苏联的前进基地。可是美帝国主义的算盘打错了。朝鲜人民及其武装部队和中国人民志愿军协同作战，给丧心病狂的侵略者以坚决的回击。现在美国侵略者所进行的罪恶滔天的细菌战，也必被刚毅坚定的朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军所粉碎。朝鲜人民的正义斗争不是孤立的。全世界的进步人类，以苏联人民为首的亿万爱好自由的人民，都站在朝鲜人民这一边。
    全世界三分之一以上的居民结成了以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主与社会主义阵营。在资本主义国家的亿万的正直人们都支持这一阵营。这种支持的表现是：在坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策及其挑拨新的世界战争的阴谋的斗争中，和平拥护者的队伍正在不断增长和扩大。
    和帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾日趋尖锐化的同时，和平、民主与社会主义阵营的人民的团结和友谊正日益增强。这个阵营的领袖就是世界和平旗手伟大的斯大林同志。
