Dear Children of New China:

    On behalf of the Korean People's Delegation to China, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, the most adorable flowers of New China, the hope of New China, and the successors of New China.

    Our delegation visited China. We saw many patriotic actions displayed by every young person in participating in the great national construction, and many heroic and exemplary deeds emerging in work and study. We also saw your loyalty to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, your spirit of loving learning and labor, and your unparalleled hatred and courage towards the enemy, especially your enthusiastic support for the victorious struggle of the Korean people, and the vigorous unfolding of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.

    Through your patriotic actions, we heard the solemn and orderly footsteps from the bright road of New Democracy to Socialism. Seeing the red scarves tied around your necks, we also saw the glorious and brilliant new generation of 500 million Chinese people, as well as the symbols of new morality, new history, and a new world.

    Dearest Chinese children: Your victory and pride are also the victory and pride of the Korean children. Today, Korean children are welcoming this festival in a cruel struggle for the victory of their motherland. At this very moment, Korean children are aiming at the chests of the enemy in the ranks of the enemy's rear and the guerrillas, carrying out revenge shooting. In all the ruined cities, on all the blood-stained highlands, in the suffocating trenches, and in the rain-filled underground classrooms, Korean children are gloriously welcoming "June 1st" International Children's Day. Although the environment is so harsh, the Korean children who bravely stand on the road of struggle do not know tears, do not know pain, do not know hunger and cold, and do not know surrender. They only know struggle and victory.

    The honor of the Korean children is also your honor. The children of Korea and China have an inseparable relationship of flesh and blood. This is because the children of Korea and China have a common ideal. In order to strive for the realization of the same ideal, the children of the two countries have condensed an unparalleled and consolidated friendship with blood.

    Children! Advance more bravely towards victory! Further improve your enthusiasm for learning and strive to strengthen your bodies! In the just struggle to strike at the American imperialist aggressors, let the children of Korea and China unite more closely, and let us unite more closely with the children of the whole world!

    In welcoming this year's "June 1st" International Children's Day, people all over the world who love peace, love democracy, and love their next generation have united, holding high the banner of peace and advancing bravely for your future. The cry of "Oppose germ warfare, protect children" is shaking the whole world.

    In the near future, Korean children will rebuild more beautiful cities and villages on the ruins, become true victors, and sing aloud for a happy and fulfilling life.

    The masters of the future of mankind, the hope and flowers of mankind, the new generation of the whole world, infinite glory and happiness belong to you forever!

    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲给中国儿童的贺信亲爱的新中国的小朋友们：
    我以朝鲜人民访华代表团的名义，向最可爱的你们——新中国的花朵、新中国的希望、新中国的继承者，致以衷心的祝贺。
    我们代表团访问了中国。我们看见了每一位少年在参加伟大的祖国建设事业中所表现的许多爱国行动，在工作上、学习上涌现的许多英雄、模范的事迹。我们还看见了你们对毛主席和共产党的忠诚，爱好学习和劳动的精神，以及对敌人无比的憎恨和勇敢，特别是热情地支援朝鲜人民的胜利斗争，轰轰烈烈地展开了抗美援朝运动。
    通过你们的爱国行动，我们听见了从新民主主义到社会主义光明道路的庄严整齐的步伐声。看见了结在你们颈上的红领巾，我们也就看见了五亿中国人民的光辉灿烂的新的一代，以及新道德、新历史和新世界的象征。
    最亲爱的中国小朋友们：你们的胜利和骄傲，也就是朝鲜小朋友们的胜利和骄傲。今天，朝鲜小朋友们为了祖国的胜利，是在残酷的斗争中来迎接这一节日的。就在这个时候，这一瞬间，朝鲜小朋友们在敌后和游击队的行列里，正对准敌人的胸膛，进行着复仇的射击。在所有变成废墟的城市里，在所有染满鲜血的高地上，在窒息的战壕里，在积满雨水的地洞教室里，朝鲜小朋友们正光荣地迎接着“六一”国际儿童节。虽然环境是这样艰苦，但是英勇地站在斗争的道路上的朝鲜小朋友们，不知道流泪，不知道痛苦，不知道饥寒，更不知道屈服，他们只知道斗争和胜利。
    朝鲜小朋友们的荣誉，同时也就是你们的荣誉。朝中两国的小朋友们是有着血肉不可分的关系的。这是因为朝中两国的小朋友们有着共同的理想，为了争取同一理想的实现，两个国家的小朋友们用鲜血凝结成了无比巩固的友谊。
    小朋友们！向着胜利，更勇敢地前进吧！再进一步提高学习热情，努力锻炼身体！在打击美帝国主义侵略者的正义斗争中，朝中儿童更加紧密地团结起来吧，并且和全世界的儿童们，也更加紧密地团结起来吧！
    在迎接今年“六一”国际儿童节的时候，全世界爱护和平、爱护民主、爱护自己的下一代的人们已经团结起来，为了你们的未来，高举着和平的旗帜勇敢前进，“反对细菌战，保卫儿童”的呼声，正震动着整个世界。
    朝鲜小朋友们在不远的将来，就将在废墟上重新建立起更加美丽的城市和乡村，成为真正的胜利者，高声歌唱幸福美满的生活。
    人类未来的主人翁，人类的希望和花朵，全世界的新的一代，无限的光荣和幸福永远属于你们！
