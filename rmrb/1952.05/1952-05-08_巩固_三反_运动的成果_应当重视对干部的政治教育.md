    Consolidate the Achievements of the "Three-Anti" Campaign:
    Importance Should Be Attached to the Political Education of Cadres

    Editor: In the past, some departments in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, had a serious tendency to ignore politics, with the result that some cadres could not withstand the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and became prisoners of bourgeois lawbreakers. However, these facts have not aroused the vigilance of the leading comrades of the relevant departments. They are still taking a passive attitude towards the instructions of the higher party committee to "restore theoretical study for cadres." Some Communist Party branches in agencies, factories, and enterprises have relaxed the education of party members and the leadership of party propaganda work. Most of the propagandists in the agencies have not played the role they should have played. For example, the propagandist of the Gaoyang Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company does not even know what he should do, and the comrades of the Communist Party branch committee of the Jianhua Factory do not even know who the propagandists are in the factory.

    In order to consolidate the achievements of the "Three-Anti" campaign and raise the ideological and political awareness of cadres, I believe that strengthening the ideological and political education of cadres is a very important task. Therefore, I suggest that all departments, especially economic departments, should systematically and step-by-step conduct class education and patriotic ideological education for cadres, and establish and restore normal work and study systems among cadres in agencies.

### 巩固“三反”运动的成果  应当重视对干部的政治教育

    巩固“三反”运动的成果
    应当重视对干部的政治教育
    编辑同志：河北省高阳县某些部门，过去曾有严重的不问政治倾向，以致有些干部经不起资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，成了资产阶级不法分子的俘虏。但是这些事实还没有引起有关部门领导同志的警惕，他们现在对上级党委的“恢复干部理论学习”的指示，仍抱着置之不理的态度。有些机关、工厂、企业的共产党支部放松了对党员的教育和对党的宣传工作的领导。大部分机关的宣传员没有起到应起的作用，如高阳花纱布支公司的宣传员连自己该做什么都不知道，建华工厂共产党支部委员会的同志连厂中那些人是宣传员也不知道。
    为了巩固“三反”运动的成果，提高干部的思想政治觉悟，我认为加强对干部的思想政治教育，是一个非常重要的工作。因此，我建议各部门，特别是经济部门，应有系统有步骤地对干部进行阶级教育和爱国主义的思想教育，并在机关干部中建立和恢复正常的工作、学习制度。
