　　TASS, Vienna, May 27th: World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant sent a telegram to Free German Trade Union Federation Chairman Warnke regarding the signing of the military-oriented "General Treaty" in Bonn. The telegram stated: "At this critical juncture for the German people, the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing eighty million trade union members, expresses solidarity with the German working people who are waging a great struggle for a unified, peace-loving, democratic, and independent Germany, and against the 'General Treaty,' which is a tool of war. The 'General Treaty' is the mortal enemy of the happiness and independence of the German nation." "The fact that this treaty was signed by Western governments proves that the warmongers are attempting to permanently turn Germany into a breeding ground for war and that they want to divide and occupy German territory." "In addition to other disastrous consequences for the German people, the 'General Treaty' also permits the treaty-makers—the capitalist countries—to declare a state of emergency at any time, especially during strikes, and to use armed forces to suppress the German people." "The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the German working people to be mindful of the danger of fascism and calls on them to unite and fight against the militaristic 'General Treaty,' and for a peace treaty based on the Potsdam Agreement, which fully guarantees the German people's national independence and a democratic future."

    世界工联总书记赛扬致电自由德国工联
    声援德国人民反对“一般性条约”
  　【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社维也纳二十七日讯：世界工会联合会总书记赛扬为波恩签订军事性的“一般性条约”一事，致电自由德国工会联合会主席瓦恩克。电文说：“值此德国人民生死存亡的关头，世界工会联合会代表八千万工会会员，对正在为争取统一、爱好和平、民主、独立的德国，反对作为战争工具的‘一般性条约’而进行伟大斗争的德国劳动人民，表示团结一致。‘一般性条约’是德意志民族的幸福与独立的死敌。“这个条约由西方国家政府签订这一事实就证明战争贩子们企图把德国永远变成制造战争的地方，证明它们要分裂与占领德国领土。“‘一般性条约’除了带给德国人民其他祸国殃民的后果外，它还准许条约制造者——资本主义国家——在任何时候，特别是在罢工的时候，宣告紧急状态，并得使用武装部队镇压德国人民。“世界工会联合会号召德国劳动人民注意法西斯主义的危险，并号召他们团结一致，为反对军国主义的‘一般性条约’、争取以充分保证德国人民获得民族独立与民主前途的波茨坦协定为基础的和约而斗争。”
