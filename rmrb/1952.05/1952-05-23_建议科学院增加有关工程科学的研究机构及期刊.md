Reader's Letters

    To the Editor: After reading the "Directory of Journals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" published in the People's Daily by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I feel that although the journals published by the Chinese Academy of Sciences have undergone some adjustments, the distribution is still not balanced enough. For example, among the eighteen journals listed in the notice, as many as seven are related to biology (namely, "Acta Entomologica Sinica," "Acta Zoologica Sinica," "Acta Botanica Sinica," "Acta Physiologica Sinica," "Acta Palaeontologica Sinica," "Acta Microbiologica Sinica," and "Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica"), while only two are related to engineering: "CIESC Journal" and "Engineering Journal." With large-scale economic construction about to gradually unfold, only two engineering science journals are simply insufficient.

    The above situation is inseparable from the imbalance in research institutions and research work under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. For example, there are numerous research institutions related to biology, while there are very few related to engineering science. This imbalanced phenomenon should be corrected. Therefore, I suggest that the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences consider appropriately developing the urgently needed research work in engineering science and appropriately increase the number of engineering science journals.

    建议科学院增加有关工程科学的研究机构及期刊
    编辑同志：读了中国科学院编译局在人民日报上登载的“中国科学院期刊名录”启事之后，我感到中国科学院所出版的期刊虽然已有了一些调整，但分配仍是不够平衡的。如在启事中所举的十八种期刊，有关生物学的竟占七种之多（即“昆虫学报”、“动物学报”、“植物学报”、“生理学报”、“古生物学报”“微生物学报”及“植物分类学报”），而有关工程方面的只有“化工学报”、“工程学报”两种。在大规模经济建设即将逐步开展的今天，只有两种有关工程科学的期刊，实在是不敷需要的。
    上述情况和中国科学院所属研究机构及研究工作的不平衡现象是分不开的。如有关生物学的研究机构名目繁多，而有关工程科学的研究机构则寥寥无几。这种不平衡的现象，是应该纠正的。因此，我建议中国科学院领导方面，考虑适当地发展目前急迫需要的工程科学的研究工作，并适当增加一些工程科学的期刊。　　　　陈　陵
