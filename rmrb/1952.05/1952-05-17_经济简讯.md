Economic Briefs

    ▲ The Puxi District of Yizheng County, Subei, is nationally renowned for its Puxi mats, with a peak annual output of 800,000 mats in the past. Before liberation, transportation was hindered, sales were sluggish, and the masses' enthusiasm for production was low. After liberation, Yizheng County established the Puxi Mat Supply and Marketing Cooperative to support the Puxi industry. On the one hand, it educated members to improve product quality, and on the other hand, it tried to open up product sales, and has made great achievements. At present, the output of Puxi mats has recovered to an annual output of 400,000. In order to help its members produce, the cooperative has lent mat grass for processing according to the different economic conditions of the members during the lean season this year. In the past three months, it has lent more than 40,000 jin of processing raw materials such as luoma and more than 7,000 dan of mat grass. A total of more than 210,000 jin of wage grain has been issued, solving the living and production difficulties of most mat weaving households in the area.
    ▲ The Lianjiang Irrigation Project in Huishui County, Guizhou Province, held a completion and water release ceremony on May 1st. This is the largest irrigation project completed in Guizhou Province this spring. The Lianjiang River originates in Guizhu County and is a small tributary of the Panjiang River on the border between Guizhou and Guangxi provinces. After the Lianjiang River flows into Huishui County, the river surface is low and the fields on both sides are high, making it impossible to irrigate the farmland on both banks. The Lianjiang Irrigation Project was built before liberation, taking five years and costing 11 million jin of rice, but it was never completed. After liberation, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Bureau of Water Conservancy of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government sent personnel to Lianjiang to conduct surveys and meticulous planning, and decided to renovate it. Last June, local farmers were mobilized to build it in sections, and it was completed by the end of February this year. A total of 283 buildings of various types have been built, and 18 diversion canals, main canals, branch canals, and distribution canals (with a total length of about 48 kilometers) have been built, which can irrigate 22,000 mu of farmland. The farmland benefiting from the entire canal can increase rice production by 3,187,500 jin per year, and the worries of drought for farmers in the Huishui Plain will be eliminated forever.
    ▲ Spring cocoons in East China are about to be launched on the market. The state-owned China Silk Company and the East China Cooperative General Agency have reached an agreement that the cooperative will handle 95% of the purchase tasks this year. It is estimated that the output of silkworm cocoons in East China this year will increase by nearly one time compared with 1949, and native cocoons have basically been eliminated. The unit yield has also been greatly improved. At the beginning of liberation, each silkworm paper only produced 25 jin of cocoons, and now the average yield is 40 to 50 jin of cocoons. In order to further restore and develop silk production, encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production, and reward improved quality, East China has specifically stipulated a seven-level evaluation method for the purchase of spring cocoons this year to further implement the policy of preferential prices for high-quality cocoons. Therefore, the average price of spring cocoons this year will generally increase by about 10% compared with the actual income of silkworm farmers last year. This is a reform with great significance in terms of price policy and a concrete measure to further protect the interests of silkworm farmers.
    ▲ The Fujian Province Forest Area, one of the four major forest areas in the country, launched a afforestation campaign in 66 counties and cities this spring. This includes economic forests built in the mountainous areas of the Minjiang River Basin and windbreak forests built in coastal areas. According to statistics, more than 100,000 mu of forest have been planted and more than 2,300 mu of seedlings have been cultivated in the province.
    While launching the afforestation campaign, the people's governments at all levels in the Fujian Forest Area have also strengthened mountain protection and forest protection work. There are currently 5,534 forest protection committees and forest protection groups in the province. Each forest protection group has formulated a patriotic forest protection agreement. Local militias have strengthened their work in surveying mountains and protecting forests.

    经济简讯
     ▲苏北仪征县朴席区，是全国闻名的朴席特产地，过去最高产量每年达八十万条。解放前由于交通阻碍，销路不畅，群众生产情绪低落。解放后，仪征县成立了朴席供销合作社，对朴席业加以扶持，一方面教育社员提高产品质量，一方面设法打开产品销路，已做出很大成绩。目前朴席产量已恢复到年产四十万条。该社为了扶助社员生产，在今年青黄不接之时，根据社员不同的经济情况，分别贷给席草进行加工。三个月来计贷出加工原料洛麻等共四万多斤，席草七千多担。共发出工资米二十一万多斤，解决了该地大部分织席户生活和生产上的困难。
    ▲贵州省惠水县涟江灌溉工程，已在五月一日举行落成放水典礼。这是贵州省今春修成的一处最大的灌溉工程。涟江发源于贵筑县，是贵州、广西两省交界处的盘江的一个小支流。涟江流入惠水县后，因河水面低，两岸田高，无法灌溉两岸的农田。解放前涟江灌溉工程就修过，费时五年，耗去一千一百万斤大米，但是始终未能修成。解放后，贵州省人民政府农林厅、水利局派员赴涟江勘察和缜密计划后，便决定重新整修。去年六月发动当地农民分段修建，到今年二月底就修成了。计修成各种建筑物二百八十三座，引水渠和干渠、支渠、分渠十八道（共长四十八公里左右），可灌溉农田二万二千亩。全渠受益农田每年可增产稻谷三百一十八万七千五百斤，惠水平川农民的旱灾顾虑从此永远消除。
    ▲华东区春茧即将上市。国营中国蚕丝公司和华东合作总社成立协议，今年百分之九十五的收购任务委托合作社办理。今年华东区蚕茧产量估计比一九四九年增加将近一倍，土茧已基本上消灭。单位产量也大为提高，解放初期每张蚕纸仅产茧二十五斤，现在平均产茧四十斤到五十斤。为了进一步恢复与发展蚕丝生产，鼓励农民生产情绪、奖励提高质量，今年华东区具体规定了春茧收购的七级评价办法，进一步贯彻优茧优价政策。因此今年春茧价格一般平均比去年蚕农实际所得将提高百分之十左右。这是价格政策方面具有重大意义的改革和进一步保障蚕农利益的具体措施。
    ▲全国四大林区之一的福建省林区，今春在六十六个县市展开了造林运动。这包括闽江流域各山区营造的经济林和沿海地区营造的防风林。据统计：全省已造林十多万亩，育苗二千三百多亩。
    福建林区各级人民政府，在展开造林运动的同时，也加强了护山护林工作。全省现有五千五百三十四个护林委员会和护林小组。各个护林小组都订立了爱国护林公约。各地民兵都加强了查山护林工作。
