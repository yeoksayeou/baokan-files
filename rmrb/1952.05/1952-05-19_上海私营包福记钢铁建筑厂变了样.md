The "Five-Anti" struggle at Shanghai's private Baofuji Steel Construction Plant concluded at the end of March. When Shanghai was liberated, this factory had only thirty-five workers; its only gantry planer had not even been installed yet; the one workshop was small and dark, requiring electric lights even during the day; and the cold-work shop was a makeshift structure of wooden poles and straw mats, presenting a very desolate scene. Over the past three years, with the strong support of the People's Government, it has grown with the increasing construction projects of the new China: machinery and equipment have increased, the number of workers has reached 336, and a new, tall, and large factory building has been constructed. It has become one of the larger private heavy industrial plants in Shanghai. The owner, Bao Ruilin, is technically trained, but like other capitalists, he had serious "five poisons" crimes.

The great "Five-Anti" movement has cleansed the capitalists of their "five poisons" and raised the class consciousness of the workers. On this basis, the Baofuji Steel Construction Plant has seen unprecedented new vitality. At the rally celebrating the victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle, the workers put forward the slogan: "The loopholes of the capitalist's 'five poisons' have been plugged. For the happiness of the 55 million peasant brothers and sisters on both sides of the Huai River (note: this factory is undertaking orders for the Huai River project), we must fight a more beautiful battle in production!" When accepting the second phase of the Huai River project orders, the workers showed the attitude of masters of the country. This order accounted for one-third of the total orders for the second phase of the Huai River project. It was originally planned to start work on March 15 and complete it on June 10. However, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements delayed the time. The contract was only signed on April 2; after the 8th, the materials supplied by the East China Industrial Department were gradually delivered. More than twenty days had passed, but the task had to be completed as scheduled. The capitalist lacked confidence. The workers knew that after June it would be the rainy season, and if the goods could not be delivered as scheduled, it would affect the completion of the entire second phase of the Huai River project. This was a production task related to the safety of the lives and property of millions of people. With the spirit of masters of the country, they took on this task. They wrote in their patriotic pact: "Implement the spirit of the 'Five-Anti' struggle into production, ensure the completion of the task as scheduled, and ensure that the quality meets the standards!" They also made a guarantee to Chairman Mao. Therefore, they consciously strengthened labor discipline and put forward the slogan "Don't let go of a minute, complete the task ahead of schedule."

On the eve of the "May 1st" Labor Day, I visited this factory. It was exactly two o'clock in the afternoon. As soon as the first shift bell rang, the lathes in the machine shop immediately started turning, the sound of steel colliding immediately came from the cold-work shop, and the oxyacetylene welding in the welding shop spewed blue flames. In an instant, the whole factory was boiling. I went to all the workshops and saw that the workers were very tense, and no one was idle. Li Ruizhi, the chairman of the trade union, told me that this was a new phenomenon that had emerged after the "Five-Anti" movement. In the past, the workers in the cold-work shop always started working formally half an hour or even an hour after the start of work, because they did the preparatory work when the formal working time started; when they got off work, the workers who burned rivets, regardless of whether the rivets in the furnace were burned, would leave with everyone. Now, this phenomenon is gone. The "Five-Anti" movement has changed the face of the entire factory. In the past, no one responded when the trade union proposed to implement the high-speed cutting method; now, the workers are automatically implementing it. Two engineers, in order to do a good job in pattern making, did not rest on Sundays. There was a lathe operator named Tang Guan’di, whose skills were not bad, but in the past, he always took three or four hours to complete the work that others could complete in one hour. If anyone urged him, he would stare and ask: "Hey! Who do you think you are? Mind your own business!" Now he has also become active. The movement to find tricks has begun to take shape. Yao Jinbao, a technician in the welding shop, used oxyhydrogen flame cutting instead of sawing with a steel saw when making the four-inch foreign circle for the gate sluice shaft, which increased efficiency by twenty-one times and improved quality. Lu Xinquan, a technician in the machine shop, with the help of engineer Luo Longyuan, used a punch press instead of a drilling machine to punch holes in the chain, which increased efficiency by seven times. In the twenty days after the "Five-Anti," labor productivity increased by 35%, and the scrap rate also dropped from 6% to 4.5%.

The "Five-Anti" movement further consolidated the internal unity of the working class. In the past, there was an invisible gap between senior staff and workers, and they looked down on each other. Some senior staff, although they joined the trade union, always looked down on the trade union. In this movement, the senior staff have returned to the team and drawn a line between themselves and the capitalists. Bao Tianyi, the personnel section chief, Gong Caisheng, the cold-work shop director, Chen Shijie, the general affairs director, and Jiang Yunxu, the accounting director, etc., all joined the Huai River order production research group led by the trade union, and united closely to ensure the completion of the task as scheduled and supervise the capitalist's production. A correct teacher-student relationship has also been established. In the past, when the master was working, the apprentice stood by and watched. When the apprentice asked the master a question, the master would impatiently answer: "You see for yourselves, how can the old master hold your hand to teach you?" Now the situation is different. In the cold-work shop, I saw a master pointing out the patterns to two apprentices. When an apprentice stood up to ask the master, the master opened his notebook and told him point by point. Until the apprentice nodded, indicating that he understood, they walked away together. They walked shoulder to shoulder, and the master often turned his head to look at the apprentice with kind eyes. The phenomenon of apprentices scolding masters for being "old foxes" and masters scolding apprentices for being "young foxes" has become a historical relic and no longer appears in their lives.

I talked with Li Ruizhi, the chairman of the trade union, in the trade union office. When talking about the workers' production enthusiasm, he took out a notebook from his pocket and showed me the page with this year's production tasks and production plans. He said: This is the first time that the trade union knows the order tasks and production plans. This was gained in the "Five-Anti" struggle. Having this symbolizes that the workers in our private enterprises are truly the masters of the country; we can urge the capitalists not to violate the law, we can mobilize the workers to discuss production, and we can make the factory look brand new. Before the "Five-Anti," there was no production plan in the whole factory. Workers and staff were busy from morning to night, and they didn't know which agency or enterprise unit ordered the work they were doing. No one except the capitalists knew what the specifications and standards stipulated in the contract were. At that time, although there were labor-capital consultation meetings, they never talked about production issues. The workers' eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of cloth, and they couldn't see the criminal acts committed by the capitalists under the guise of "business secrets." Once, when making large elbow pipes, the materials bought by the capitalists were all rotten iron plates. The worker Ni Fulin felt that this material was not reliable and said to the boss: "If you use this kind of iron plate, there will be problems." The boss said: "Just do it well, I will be responsible." The worker had no choice. Sometimes, the capitalists also pretended to be progressive in order to deceive the workers. When undertaking the order for the sluice gates of the Huai River last year, the capitalist said to the workers: "I am losing money on this project. But for the happiness of the millions of people on both sides of the Huai River, I will do the business even if I lose money." The workers believed it and said, "Even the capitalists are serving the people, we, the working class, should work harder." Therefore, the workers worked hard day and night, in the wind and rain. During the "Five-Anti" struggle, the capitalist confessed that he had stolen 13.1 billion yuan of national assets in the past three years. Among them, the order for the Xifeihe gate was priced at 2 billion yuan, and the capitalist made a huge profit of 600 million yuan. The workers then realized that they had been deceived by the capitalists in the past. Li Ruizhi said excitedly:

"Now, the workers are truly supervising the capitalists to abide by the order contract in the capacity of the masters of the country." The trade union led the workers to study the order contract and the production plan. The workers have grasped the product quality and specifications stipulated in the contract, their eyes are bright, and they have a clear understanding. They consciously take on the responsibility of supervision and consciously guarantee the quality of the products. Some time ago, Zhao Zhensheng, a painter, carefully checked the water drop iron for the furnace grates made for the Hubei Industrial Department and found some peeling. He scraped off the rust and saw that a one-meter-long ash mark (not well cast) had cracked off a layer, so he immediately picked it out and took it away to replace it with a good one.

The capitalists have also received a great education in the "Five-Anti" movement. The worker Wang Shanqing told me that the boss, Bao Ruilin, was once very negative after the "Five-Anti." On the second day after the end of the "Five-Anti" work, at the labor-capital unity symposium, the workers sincerely said to him:

"Mr. Bao, we are struggling against you in order to unite with you. We are fighting against your 'five poisons.' You have already confessed your crimes, and we are now uniting with you to do a good job in production so that you can start anew." He did not expect this attitude of the workers beforehand. He was so moved that he cried at the time. He said: "I have committed the 'five poisons' and it's very dirty. The workers are educating me, the government is lenient to me, and they are also placing orders with me. I will definitely do a good job in production." However, he still doubted the policy of "leniency for confession." He repeatedly asked for joint public-private management and wanted to push everything to the trade union, even asking the trade union to pay for the expenses of the joint operation. The trade union cadres said to him: "The trade union is only responsible for educating the workers to supervise the capitalists to abide by the law; the general expenses and all management aspects are your responsibilities as the capitalists, and you should actively solve them yourself; if there are special difficulties, the trade union is willing to negotiate with you to solve them." The trade union also took the initiative to mobilize engineers and senior staff to help him formulate a production plan. The attitude of the working class that everything is for the development of production and their enthusiasm for active production dispelled his ideological concerns and increased his confidence in management. He automatically disclosed the accounts and order contracts, and came to the factory at seven o'clock every morning to take care of production. He began to care about the quality of the products. He told the workers in the cold-work shop: "The rivets must be tightly riveted, rivet them a few more times, don't let them leak any water."

    上海私营包福记钢铁建筑厂变了样
    本报记者　陆超祺
    上海包福记钢铁建筑厂的“五反”斗争，已经在三月底结束。上海解放的时候，这个厂只有三十五个工人；仅有的一部龙门刨床还没装好；一间工房又小又暗，白天在里面干活还得开电灯；冷作工场是用几根木杆和席子搭起来的，景象十分萧条。三年来，在人民政府的大力扶植下，它随着新中国建设工程的日益增加而发展起来：机器设备增加了，工人已有三百三十六人，并新建了一座又高又大的厂房。它已成为上海市私营重工业中比较大的一个厂。老板包瑞麟是学技术出身的，但是，他也和别的资本家一样，有着严重的“五毒”罪行。
    伟大的“五反”运动清洗了资本家的“五毒”，提高了工人的阶级觉悟。包福记钢铁建筑厂在这个基础上，出现了从来没有过的新气象。在庆祝“五反”斗争胜利结束的大会上，工人们就提出口号：“资本家‘五毒’的漏洞塞住了，为了淮河两岸五千五百万农民兄弟的幸福（按：这个厂是承做治淮工程定货的），我们一定要在生产上打更漂亮的仗。”在接受第二期治淮工程定货任务时，工人们表现出了国家主人翁的态度。这次定货任务占第二期治淮工程定货总量的三分之一。原来计划在三月十五日开工，六月十日完成。因为开展“三反”“五反”运动，把时间耽误了。四月二日才签订了合同；八日以后，华东工业部供给的材料才陆续运到。时间已过了二十几天，而任务必须如期完成。资本家的信心不足。工人们知道六月以后就是多雨的季节，如果不能如期交货，将影响到第二期整个治淮工程的如期完成。这是关系着千百万人民生命财产安危的生产任务。他们以国家主人翁的气魄把这任务担当了下来。他们在爱国公约里写着：“把‘五反’斗争的精神贯彻到生产中去，保证如期完成任务，保证质量合乎标准！”他们并向毛主席提出了保证。因此，他们都自觉地加强了劳动纪律，提出“不放过一分钟，提前完成任务”的口号。
    “五一”劳动节前夕，我访问了这个工厂。下午正二点钟。刚打过第一下上班钟，机器工场里的车床马上转动，冷作工场里马上传来钢铁撞击的声音，电焊工场里的氧焊喷出蓝色的火焰。霎时间，整个工厂就沸腾起来。我到各工场去看了一遍，看到工人们都紧张得很，没有一个人闲着。工会主席李瑞芝告诉我，这是“五反”运动以后才出现的新气象。在以前，冷作工场工人总是上班以后半点钟甚至一点钟才正式工作的，因为他们到正式上班时才做准备工作；下班时，烧铆钉的工人，不管炉里的钉烧好了没有，就跟着大家一起走了。现在，这种现象都没有了。“五反”运动改变了整个厂的面貌。以前工会提出要实行高速切削法，没人响应；现在，工人自动地实行了。有两位工程师，为了做好打样工作，星期日也不休息。有一个叫做唐关弟的车工，技术并不差，但是，在过去，人家一小时做完的活，他总得三、四小时才做完。谁要是催他一下，他就瞪着眼睛问：“喂！你算老几？别狗咬老鼠管闲事！”现在他也积极起来了。找窍门运动开始形成。电焊工场技工姚金宝，做闸门滑轮轴心的四吋洋元时，用氢氧焰烧切代替用钢锯来锯，提高效率二十一倍，并且提高了质量。机工场技工陆新泉，在工程师罗龙元的帮助下，用冲床代替钻床来打链条上的眼，提高效率七倍。“五反”后的二十天中，劳动生产率比以前提高了百分之三十五，废品率也从百分之六降到了百分之四点五。
    “五反”运动更加巩固了工人阶级的内部团结。在以前，高级职员和工人之间，有着一道无形的鸿沟，彼此瞧不起。有些高级职员虽然参加了工会，但是总看不起工会。在这次运动中，高级职员都归了队，和资本家划清了界线。人事科长包天一、冷作工场主任龚蔡生、总务主任陈世杰、会计主任蒋云嘘等，都参加了工会领导的治淮定货生产研究小组，为保证如期完成任务、督促资本家生产而紧紧地团结起来。正确的师徒关系也建立起来了。在以前，师傅做活时，徒工站在旁边看。徒工向师傅提出问题时，师傅就不耐烦地答道：“你们自己用眼看，老师傅那能捉牢你们的手来教呢？”现在的情形不一样了。在冷作工场里，我看到一个师傅在那里指点两个徒工划样子。有一个徒工站起来问师傅，师傅打开笔记本，逐点告诉他。直到徒工点了头，表示懂得了的时候，他们才一起走开。他们肩并肩地走着，师傅时时转过头来，用慈祥的眼睛望着徒工。徒工骂师傅做“老油条”、师傅骂徒工做“小油条”的现象，已成为历史上的陈迹，不再在他们的生活中出现了。
    我和工会主席李瑞芝在工会办公室里谈话。谈到工人的生产积极性时，他从衣袋里掏出一个笔记本来，找出记有今年生产任务和生产计划的那一页给我看。他说：工会知道定货任务和生产计划，这还是头一次。这是在“五反”斗争中得来的。有了这，就象征着我们私营企业里的工人真正是国家的主人翁了；我们就可以督促资本家不违法，可以发动工人讨论生产，可以使工厂的面貌一新。“五反”以前，全厂没有生产计划。工人、职员从早忙到晚，不晓得做的活是哪一个机关或企业单位定的。合同上规定的规格和标准怎样，除了资本家外，谁也不知道。那时候，虽有劳资协商会议，但总谈不到生产的问题。工人们的眼睛好像蒙上了一层布，看不到资本家在“营业秘密”的掩饰下干的犯罪行为。曾有一次，做大弯头水管子，资本家买来的材料，都是烂皮铁板。工人倪富林觉得这材料不牢靠，对老板说：“用这样的铁板做，会出毛病的。”老板说：“你只管做好了，责任由我负。”工人没有办法。有的时候，资本家还假惺惺地装出一副进步的脸孔来欺骗工人。去年承制淮河水闸的定货时，资本家对工人说：“我做这个工程是蚀本的。但是为了淮河两岸千百万人民的幸福，蚀本生意我也做。”工人们信以为真，都说：“连资本家都为人民服务，我们工人阶级更应该加油干。”于是，工人们在日里、夜里、风里、雨里都使劲地干。在“五反”斗争时，资本家坦白了三年来共盗窃国家资财一百三十一亿元。其中西淝河的闸门定货，定价二十亿元，资本家就获得暴利六亿元。工人们这才知道过去受了资本家的骗。李瑞芝很激动地说：
    “现在，工人真正以国家主人翁的身份，督促着资本家遵守定货合同。”工会领导工人研究了定货合同和生产计划。工人们掌握了合同规定的产品质量和规格，眼睛明亮了，心里有数了。他们都自觉地负起督促的责任，自觉地保证产品的质量。前些日子，油漆工人赵振生，仔细地检查给湖北工业厅做的炉子搁栅的水落铁时，发现有些脱皮，他铲去锈铁，看见有一公尺长的夹灰痕（没铸好）已裂去了一层，就立刻把它拣出来，拿去掉换好的。
    资本家在“五反”运动中，也受到了很大的教育。工人王善庆对我说，老板包瑞麟在“五反”后，曾经一度很消极。在“五反”工作结束后的第二天，在劳资团结座谈会上，工人诚恳地对他说：
    “包先生，我们斗争你，是为了团结你。我们斗争的是你的‘五毒’。你已经坦白认罪了，我们现在团结你好好搞生产，使你重新做人。”工人的这种态度，他事先是想不到的。他当时感动得痛哭起来。他说：“我犯了‘五毒’很龌龊。工人教育我，政府对我宽大，还向我定货。我一定搞好生产。”但是，他还怀疑“坦白从宽”的政策。他口口声声要求公私合营，什么事都想推给工会，甚至连支付联营所的经费也来问工会。工会干部对他说：“工会只负责教育工人督促资本家守法；一般开支和一切经营管理方面的事，都是你资方的职权，你自己主动地去解决好了；如有特殊的困难时，工会愿意和你协商解决。”工会又主动地动员工程师、高级职员去帮助他订生产计划。工人阶级一切为了发展生产的态度和积极生产的热忱，使他消除了思想顾虑，提高了经营的信心。他自动地把账目和定货合同公开出来，每天早晨七点钟就来工厂关照生产了。他开始关心产品的质量。他叮嘱冷作工场的工人说：“铆钉要铆得紧，多铆几下，不要使它漏一点水。”
