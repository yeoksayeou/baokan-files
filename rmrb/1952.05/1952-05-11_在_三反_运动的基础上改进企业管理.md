    Improving Enterprise Management on the Basis of the "Three-Anti" Movement
    Chen Shaomin

    After Chairman Mao issued a call to the people of the whole country at the beginning of this year to launch a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the workers and staff of state-owned textile enterprises in various places immediately, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, launched a vigorous "Three-Anti" movement. After several months of arduous struggle, the corrupt elements placed inside state-owned enterprises by illegal bourgeois elements to steal state property and undermine national construction were successfully eliminated, the rampant attacks of bourgeois illegal elements against state-owned enterprises were repelled, and the leadership of the working class was consolidated. This is a glorious victory.

    All problems in enterprise management have been exposed in this "Three-Anti" movement. We only need to look at a few major systems to see that the problems in enterprise management in the past were extremely serious. Many factories did not have strict receipt and payment systems for raw materials. In terms of raw cotton receipt and payment, before March 1951, Tianjin implemented a so-called "unified receipt and payment" system, that is, the Textile Administration Bureau uniformly calculated, and raw cotton was not weighed when sent to each factory, nor was cotton weighed in the opening and cleaning room. In other regions and in Tianjin after March 1951, although raw cotton was weighed when entering the factory, cotton was not weighed in the opening and cleaning room. Raw cotton accounts were extremely chaotic, some calculated by bale, others by jin. The figures for raw cotton receipt and payment were unclear, the amount of cotton used per unit was arbitrarily fabricated, and when the total was incorrect, the method of adjusting inventory was used to make up for it. For example, the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory adjusted its monthly inventory by as much as 20,000 jin to 200,000 jin. Fine yarn output was calculated in "hanks," and the conversion rate changed daily, with some factories' conversion rates as high as 115 percent and as low as 88 percent. The workers had no idea how much yarn was actually produced each day. In this way, corrupt elements could play tricks and steal large quantities of raw cotton and finished products. In terms of warehouse management, there was neither a strict system nor periodic inventory checks and account reconciliation, so the leaders had no idea what was going on, and raw materials, materials, and finished products were stolen at will. In short, the corrupt old system opened the door wide for corrupt elements to steal. The fruits of the hard work of the workers, the wealth that should have been accumulated for the country, were stolen in large quantities through loopholes in enterprise management under the attack of illegal bourgeois elements. As the workers said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's call for the 'Three-Anti' movement, in a few years the factory would no longer be owned by the working class and the state!"

    Why did these serious problems exist for a long time? The main reasons are: the various corrupt systems left over from bureaucratic capitalist enterprises were not fundamentally reformed, the thinking of many technical and management personnel who were taken over as they were was not well transformed, and the illegal bourgeois elements lurking in the management机构were not cleared out in time, this is one aspect; on the other hand, some administrative cadres we sent to the factories lacked understanding of state-owned enterprises and experience in managing factories, and there was also a serious bureaucratic work style. Therefore, they were not good at relying on the broad masses of workers, fully mobilizing the masses, and implementing democratic management. Trade union cadres only cared about workshop production and did not pay attention to business management. Illegal bourgeois elements seized on these weaknesses and launched rampant attacks on state-owned enterprises from within and without.

    Generally speaking, the cadres we sent to the factories to take on leadership work were active in their work and subjectively wanted to manage the factories well. However, many comrades did not understand a basic issue, that is, to manage a socialist state-owned enterprise, it is necessary to rely on the leadership of the Party, the efforts of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, to educate and rely on the strength of the workers, and to transform the ideological style of the old technical personnel in order to run the factory well; their mass viewpoint was too poor, they were not good at following the mass line, and they were not good at organizing the strength of the masses and relying on the masses to manage the factory. They did not pay attention to adopting the rationalization proposals of the workers and reforming the management system, and they did not plan to train and promote worker cadres to leadership organs to take on leadership work and change the composition of the leadership. On the contrary, they blindly worshiped the "technology" of those untransformed technical and management personnel, and blindly accommodated their backward thinking, only uniting without struggle. In this case, those untransformed old technical and management personnel tried their best to deceive the leadership and carry out theft. Last year, the trade union proposed establishing a weighing system, with weighing as the main method and referring to "hanks" to calculate fine yarn output, but some technical personnel resolutely opposed it, believing that it was "wasteful of manpower and money." In essence, some people opposed weighing because it was not convenient for them to embezzle if weighing was implemented. Some of our leading cadres blindly followed suit and opposed it. Some technical personnel suggested implementing "unified receipt and payment of raw cotton," saying that this was to "save manpower" and "reduce costs," but in essence it was to steal raw cotton without the workers knowing. Some of our leading comrades adopted and implemented this without analysis. Based on the experience of some factories, the trade union proposed in 1950 that the amount of cotton used for unified drawing of each count of yarn would not exceed 400 jin, but some technical personnel insisted that 410.9 jin were needed, and many of our leading cadres believed it to be true. These comrades were superstitious about "technology" and became prisoners of illegal bourgeois elements. Some of our leading comrades, although active in their work, did not work properly, and as a result became hard-working bureaucrats. They were busy all day approving notes and stamping seals, but rarely studied major issues such as reforming the old system, reforming business management, and training and promoting worker cadres. Some leading cadres of textile factories had not checked accounting books for three years, and large amounts of cash were stolen without their knowledge. The "Three-Anti" movement sounded the alarm for our leading comrades, and a series of serious problems shocked them. One factory director said painfully: "I have been a factory director for three years, but in reality I have been a puppet of illegal bourgeois elements for three years!"

    The malpractices in the management of state-owned enterprises have been fully exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement. Leading cadres and all staff and workers have received a profound education in this movement. The leading cadres' minds have been cleared, the staff and workers have realized the harm of corrupt elements to the factory, drawn a clear line between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and their class consciousness has been greatly improved. A large number of activists and factory management talents have emerged. These are all favorable conditions for reforming enterprise management. Facts tell us that the "Three-Anti" movement is a thorough democratic reform. We should, on the basis of the "Three-Anti" movement, thoroughly reform the corrupt systems and management methods left over from bureaucratic capitalist enterprises, eliminate the filth left over from the old society, and establish new systems and new management methods. Only in this way can we carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, implement the economic accounting system, reduce costs, and truly build our state-owned enterprises into socialist enterprises, giving play to their leading role in economic construction.

    Reforming the enterprise management system, carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, implementing economic accounting, greatly reducing costs, and accumulating funds for the country's large-scale industrial construction are the most glorious and arduous political tasks of managers of state-owned enterprises, trade union workers, and all staff and workers. In order to successfully undertake this glorious task, the leading comrades of state-owned enterprises should, based on the problems exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement and the opinions of the masses, deeply examine and conscientiously correct their right-leaning thinking and bureaucratic work style. We must clearly recognize the importance of reforming enterprise management, and from the perspectives of ideology, system, organization, and management methods, conscientiously draw a line between ourselves and capitalist enterprises, carry out specific reforms, humbly listen to the opinions of staff and workers, honestly rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff and workers, and implement democratic management. Trade union cadres must correct the view of not being concerned with business management and conscientiously study enterprise management. In the "Three-Anti" movement, the leading cadres of many factories concentrated their efforts on leading the "Three-Anti" movement, and the trade union organizations took on the actual responsibility of managing production, organized the masses to solve key problems in production, and completed production tasks. This shows that as long as our leading cadres follow the mass line and specifically study production management, they are able to manage the factory well.

    We should conscientiously study and analyze the management system in order to formulate a new scientific management system to replace the old system left over from bureaucratic capitalist enterprises. We should establish strict receipt and payment systems, audit systems, raw material budget systems, periodic inventory checks, account reconciliation, hierarchical responsibility systems, and so on. Cotton textile factories should implement a weighing system for everything from raw cotton entering the factory to spinning yarn. Factories that have not yet implemented weighing, such as wool, linen, and silk factories, should also implement weighing. Fine yarn output should be calculated mainly by weighing, with reference to "hanks." Calculating fine yarn output solely based on "hanks" is deceiving the state and deceiving the workers. We can no longer continue to be deceived, and we will never allow our labor fruits to be embezzled or stolen again. Raw materials, materials, output, and costs should be calculated using the most scientific and practical methods. Everything must be clear in our minds in order to implement economic accounting and manage the people's enterprises well.

    In state-owned enterprises under the leadership of the people's regime, the quality of management depends not only on whether the management system is reasonable, but also on whether the people executing the system are serving the people. We must resolutely remove those technical and management personnel who are of poor character and habitually corrupt from their leadership positions, and we must boldly promote outstanding cadres from among the workers to replace their work and strengthen the administrative organs. Only in this way can we change the composition of the leadership and strengthen the connection between administrative management and the masses of workers. Trade union organizations should select active members with both virtue and talent from among their members and recommend them to the administrative side to assist the administrative side in doing a good job of promoting worker cadres. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union decided to transfer the strongest grassroots trade union chairmen to the administrative side to serve as deputy factory directors, which is very good. When the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory was preparing to promote worker cadres, it determined the conditions for promoting cadres, and after repeated discussions, nominations, and reviews by the masses, it finally selected 196 activists who could be promoted. The administrative side will promote them to administrative management cadres based on the opinions of the masses and the conditions of these activists. The masses have once again received a profound education through the evaluation of cadres, and their sense of responsibility as masters has been enhanced. The workers said: "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we be masters of the house (manage the factory)." "We are the masters, and we can no longer have a mixed-meal attitude, and we must work hard in production!" This method of democratic evaluation and leadership appointment is the best method for promoting cadres. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the political education of technical and management personnel, criticize their purely technical viewpoints and bourgeois ideology, raise their class consciousness, transform them into intellectuals of the working class, and give play to their active role in production.

    In the "Three-Anti" movement, the administrative side and the trade union closely cooperated and achieved great victories on the two fronts of production and anti-corruption struggle. We should, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, reform the management system and administrative organs, rectify the trade union organizations, strengthen the political education of the staff and workers, raise the class consciousness of the staff and workers, strengthen labor discipline, organize the staff and workers to actively participate in enterprise management, implement mass supervision over production, carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and strive to run the people's enterprises well and welcome the country's large-scale economic construction!

    在“三反”运动的基础上改进企业管理
    陈少敏
    今年元旦毛主席向全国人民发出开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的号召以后，各地国营纺织企业的职工群众立即在党委的统一领导下，掀起了轰轰烈烈的“三反”运动。经过几个月的艰苦斗争，胜利地清除了不法资产阶级分子安置在国营企业内部盗窃国家财产、破坏祖国建设的贪污分子，打退了资产阶级不法分子向国营企业的猖狂进攻，巩固了工人阶级的领导权。这是一个辉煌的胜利。
    企业管理中的一切问题，在这次“三反”运动中，通通被揭发出来了。我们只要从几种主要制度上，便可看出过去企业管理中存在的问题是极为严重的。许多工厂在原料、材料的收付方面没有严格的收付制度。原棉收付方面，在一九五一年三月以前，天津实行所谓“统收”统付制，即由纺织管理局统一计算，原棉送到各厂不过磅，清花间用棉也不过磅。其他地区和一九五一年三月以后的天津，原棉入厂虽然过磅，但清花间用棉却不过磅。原棉账目极端混乱，这里以包计，那里以斤计。原棉收付数字搞不清楚，单位用棉量任意乱造，总数不对时就用调整盘存的办法来弥补。如国营天津第二棉纺织厂每月盘存竟加减二万斤至二十万斤。细纱产量以“亨司”计算，折算率每天变动，有的厂折算率竟高达百分之一百一十五，低到百分之八十八。究竟每天实际生产多少纱，工人也莫名其妙。这样，贪污分子就可以玩弄花样，大量盗窃原棉和成品。仓库管理方面既没有严格的制度，又不定期清查仓库、核对账目，领导人心中没数，原料、物料、成品任人盗窃。总之，腐朽的旧制度给贪污分子大开盗窃之门。工人群众辛勤劳动的果实，应为国家积累的财富，竟在资产阶级不法分子的进攻下，经过企业管理上的漏洞，被大批大批地盗窃去了。正如工人所说：“要不是毛主席号召‘三反’，再过几年工厂就变成不是工人阶级和国家所有的了！”
    这些严重问题为什么长期存在呢？主要原因是：官僚资本企业遗留下来的各种腐朽的制度没有进行根本改革，原封不动包下来的许多技术人员、管理人员的思想没有很好地改造，潜藏在管理机构中的资产阶级不法分子没有及时清除，这是一方面；另一方面，我们派进工厂去的一些行政干部缺乏对国营企业的认识和管理工厂的经验，又存在着严重的官僚主义作风。因此就不善于依靠广大工人群众，充分发动群众，实行民主管理。工会干部则只顾搞车间生产，不注意经营管理。资产阶级不法分子抓住了这些弱点，就里应外合地向国营企业猖狂进攻。
    一般地说，我们派到工厂里去担负领导工作的干部，工作是积极的，主观上是想把工厂管好的。但是，许多同志对于一个基本问题没搞清楚，即管理社会主义性质的国营企业，必须依靠党的领导，工会和青年团的努力，教育和依靠工人的力量，改造旧的技术人员的思想作风，才能把工厂搞好；他们的群众观点太差，不善于走群众路线，不善于组织群众力量、依靠群众管理工厂。他们对于采纳工人群众的合理化建议，改革管理制度很不重视，没有有计划地培养和提拔工人干部到领导机关中来，担负领导工作，改变领导成分。相反的，对于那些未经改造的技术人员、管理人员，盲目地崇拜他们的“技术”，对于他们的落后思想一味迁就，只有团结没有斗争。在这种情况下，那些未经改造的旧的技术人员和管理人员，就千方百计地蒙蔽领导，进行盗窃。去年工会提议建立过磅制度，以过磅为主，参照“亨司”计算细纱产量，有些技术人员们坚决反对，认为这是“劳民伤财”。实质上，有些人反对过磅是因为实行过磅不便于他们贪污。我们的某些领导干部竟盲目地跟着一起反对。有些技术人员建议实行“原棉统收统付”，他们说这是为了“节省人力”“减低成本”，实质上是为了盗窃原棉不让工人知道。我们的某些领导同志竟不加分析便采纳实行。工会根据某些厂的经验，在一九五零年就提出各支纱统扯用棉量不会超过四百斤，但某些技术人员硬说需要用四百一十点九斤，我们许多领导干部竟信以为真。这些同志迷信“技术”，竟作了不法资产阶级分子的俘虏。我们的一些领导同志，工作虽然积极，但是工作不得法，结果成了辛辛苦苦的官僚主义者。他们整天忙于批条子、盖章子，对于改革旧制度、改革经营管理、培养和提拔工人干部等等重大问题却很少研究。有些纺织厂的领导干部，三年来没有检查过会计账目，大批现金被盗窃去了，自己还不知道。“三反”运动给我们的领导同志敲起了警钟，一系列的严重问题使他们触目心惊。有一位厂长曾痛心地说：“我当了三年厂长，实际上是给不法资产阶级分子做了三年傀儡！”
    国营企业管理中的弊病，在“三反”运动中全部暴露出来了。领导干部和全体职工群众在这一运动中受到了深刻的教育。领导干部头脑清醒了，职工群众认识了贪污分子对工厂的危害，划清了资产阶级和工人阶级的界限，阶级觉悟大大提高了，并涌现了大批积极分子和工厂管理人材。这些都是改革企业管理的有利条件。事实告诉我们，“三反”运动是彻底的民主改革。我们应该在“三反”运动的基础上，彻底改革官僚资本企业遗留下来的腐朽的制度和管理方法，扫清旧社会遗留的污毒，建立新制度、新的管理方法。只有这样，才能开展增产节约运动，实施经济核算制，减低成本，把我们的国营企业真正建设成为社会主义性质的企业，发挥它在经济建设中的领导作用。
    改革企业管理制度，开展增产节约运动，实施经济核算，大大减低成本，为国家大规模的工业建设积累资金，是国营企业的管理工作者、工会工作者和全体职工群众最光荣最艰巨的政治任务。为了胜利地担负起这个光荣任务，国营企业的领导同志们应根据“三反”运动中暴露出来的问题和群众的意见，深刻检讨并切实纠正自己的右倾思想和官僚主义作风。我们必须清楚认识改革企业管理的重要性，从思想上、制度上、机构上、管理方法上，认真地和资本主义的企业划清界限，进行具体的改革，虚心听取职工的意见，老老实实地依靠职工群众的积极性和创造性，实行民主管理。工会干部必须纠正不过问经营管理的观点，认真学习企业管理。在
    “三反”运动中，许多工厂的领导干部集中力量领导“三反”去了，工会组织担负起了管理生产的实际责任，组织群众解决了生产中的关键问题，完成了生产任务。这说明，我们的领导干部只要走群众路线，具体钻研生产管理，是能够管好工厂的。
    我们应该对管理制度切实加以研究、分析，从而制订新的科学的管理制度，代替官僚资本企业遗留下来的旧制度。应该建立严格的收付制度、审核制度、原材料预决算制度、定期清查仓库、核对账目、按级负责制等等制度。棉纺织厂从原棉入厂到纺成纱一律实行过磅制度。毛、麻、丝等厂还没实行过磅的，也应实行过磅。细纱产量应以过磅为主，参照“亨司”来计算。单凭“亨司”计算细纱产量，是骗国家、骗工人的。我们再不能继续受骗，我们的劳动果实绝不容许再被贪污、盗窃。原料、材料、产量、成本要以最科学最实际的方法来计算。一切心中有数，才能实行经济核算，管好人民的企业。
    在人民政权领导下的国营企业，管理工作的好坏，不仅决定于管理制度的合理不合理，而且决定于执行制度的人是不是为人民服务。必须坚决地把技术人员和管理人员中那些品质恶劣贪污成性的分子从领导岗位上撤下来，必须大胆地从工人中提拔优秀干部代替他们的工作，充实行政机构。只有这样，才能改变领导成分，密切行政管理和工人群众的联系。工会组织应从自己的会员中挑选有德有才的积极分子向行政方面推荐，协助行政方面做好提拔工人干部的工作。纺织工会天津市委员会决定调最强的基层工会主席给行政方面做副厂长，这是很好的。国营天津第二棉纺织厂在准备提拔工人干部时，确定了提拔干部的条件，经过群众反复讨论、提名、审查，最后选拔了可以提拔的积极分子一百九十六名。行政方面将根据群众的意见和这些积极分子的条件，提拔为行政管理干部。群众经过评选干部，又一次受到了深刻的教育，提高了主人翁的责任感。工人说：“只有在共产党领导下才能当家（管理工厂）。”“我们是主人，再不能有混饭吃的态度，在生产上一定好好干！”这种民主评选、领导任命的方法，是最好的提拔干部的方法。同时，必须加强对技术人员、管理人员的政治教育，批判他们的单纯技术观点和资产阶级思想，提高他们的阶级觉悟，把他们改造成为工人阶级的知识分子，发挥他们在生产上的积极作用。
    “三反”运动中，行政方面和工会密切配合，在生产和反贪污斗争两条战线上，取得了很大胜利。我们应在党委的统一领导下，改革管理制度和行政机构，整顿工会组织，加强职工群众的政治教育，提高职工群众的阶级觉悟，加强劳动纪律，组织职工群众积极参加企业管理，对生产实行群众监督，开展增产节约运动，为办好人民企业，迎接国家大规模经济建设而奋斗！
