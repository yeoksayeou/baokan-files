Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. The Hong Kong British government, disregarding the unanimous opposition of the people of our entire country, on May 9th and 14th, unreasonably arrested and deported He Yong, secretary of the Hong Kong Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union, and Ye Jinghua, clerk of the Kowloon branch of the union.

　　At approximately 10:00 AM on May 9th, more than ten plainclothes detectives went directly to the Hong Kong Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union and forced He Yong to go to the Hong Kong British Government's Political Department for "questioning," whereupon a British police officer immediately announced that he would be deported for the "reason" that he was "not needed." On the evening of the 13th, Ye Jinghua was suddenly forced into a car by three British plainclothes detectives at his workplace, "New Taxi Company," and taken to the Yau Ma Tei Police Station. On the 14th, the British barbarically escorted him to Lo Wu and deported him. During his detention, Ye Jinghua was beaten by British detectives.

　　The above two persecuted compatriots have now arrived in Guangzhou and have received condolences and care from the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the people of Guangzhou. Up to this point, in the past twenty days, the Hong Kong British government has unreasonably arrested and deported a total of thirty Chinese workers and students. The workers and the broad masses of the people of Guangzhou have expressed extreme indignation at the Hong Kong British government’s continued persecution of our compatriots, disregarding the protests of the Chinese people.

    香港英国政府竟又无理驱逐我国工人出境
    广州市人民对香港英国政府无耻暴行表示极大愤怒
    【新华社广州十六日电】香港英国政府不顾我全国人民的一致反对，竟又在五月九日、十四日，无理将香港摩托车业职工总会书记何永、该会九龙分会文书叶景华二人逮捕并驱逐出境。
    五月九日上午十时许，有便衣警探十余人迳到香港摩托车业职工总会，迫使何永前往香港英国政府政治部“问话”，并即由一英国警官宣布以“不需要”为“理由”将他递解出境。十三日晚上，叶景华在其工作的“新的士公司”内，突被三个英方便衣警探架上汽车，押赴油麻地警署。十四日英方野蛮地将他押解至罗湖驱逐出境。在被扣押期间，叶景华曾遭英方警探殴打。
    以上二位被迫害同胞现已抵达广州，受到广东省总工会筹备会和广州各界人民的慰问和照顾。至此，二十天来，香港英国政府先后已将我国工人和学生共三十人无理拘捕并驱逐出境。广州市工人和广大人民对香港英国政府不顾中国人民的抗议，继续迫害我国同胞的暴行，表示极大的愤恨。
