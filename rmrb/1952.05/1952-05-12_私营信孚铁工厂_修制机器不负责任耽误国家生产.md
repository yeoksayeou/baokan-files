    Private Xin Fu Iron Works
    Irresponsibly Repairs Machinery, Delaying National Production
    Editor: The Xizhimen Processing Factory of the Beijing Supply Bureau under the Central Ministry of Finance's Grain Administration Bureau experienced a sudden breakdown of its rice hulling machine during an intensive rice processing effort in April. This machine was purchased from the private Xin Fu Iron Works, and we were unable to repair it ourselves. Xin Fu Factory promised to repair it within three or four days. After four days, we went to pick up the machine, but saw it was still in the yard, and they had not repaired it. We immediately negotiated, and the Xin Fu Factory's负责人 [responsible person] requested an extension of three days to complete the repair. Three more days passed, and the machine was still in the yard. They didn't even cover it during rainy days, allowing the rain to rust the machine. After many more days, the factory finally repaired the machine. However, the machine was still riddled with problems, some parts were altered in specifications, and some threads were wrongly screwed, preventing the shaft from turning smoothly and preventing operation. Xin Fu Iron Works then promised to repair it after the "May 1st" Labor Day holiday, but they still haven't fixed the shaft. The machine is so broken that it cannot be started. Xin Fu Iron Works' lack of credibility is causing undue losses to the nation. After the "Five-Anti" campaign, such irresponsible behavior from this factory is unacceptable. We hope Xin Fu Iron Works will make a public self-criticism.

    私营信孚铁工厂
    修制机器不负责任耽误国家生产
    编辑同志：中央财政部粮食管理总局北京供应局西直门加工厂在四月份突击加工稻谷时，克皮机忽然发生了故障。这台机器是向私营信孚铁工厂买的，我们自己不能修理。信孚厂答应三、四天内修好。过了四天，我们到他们那里去取机器，看见机器还放在院内，他们并没有修理。我们当即交涉，信孚厂负责人要求延期三天修妥。三天又过了，机器还是放在院里。下雨天他们也不给盖，让雨淋着机器生锈。此后，又过了好多天，该厂才把机器修好了。但是，这部机器还是毛病百出，有的地方改了规格，有的地方把丝扣旋错了，来回磨轴不能开车。信孚铁工厂又答应过“五一”劳动节后修理，但到现在还没有把轴旋好。机器却坏得不能开了。信孚铁工厂这样不讲信用，给国家造成不应有的损失。在“五反”运动后，该厂还这样不负责任，这是不能容许的。我们希望信孚铁工厂作公开检讨。
