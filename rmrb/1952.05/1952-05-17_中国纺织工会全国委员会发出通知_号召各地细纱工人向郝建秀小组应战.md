The All-China Textile Workers' Union National Committee Issues Notice
Calling on Fine Yarn Workers Everywhere to Accept the Challenge from the Hao Jianxiu Group

Following the challenge issued to fine yarn workers nationwide by the Hao Jianxiu Group of the State-owned Qingdao No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory, the office of the All-China Textile Workers' Union National Committee issued a notice on May 14, calling on fine yarn workers nationwide to accept the challenge from the Hao Jianxiu Group. The full text of the notice is as follows:

The Hao Jianxiu Group, which created the scientific fine yarn working method, after careful study to consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Three-Anti" campaign and launch the patriotic production increase and economy drive, formulated a production increase and economy plan at the end of April, and issued a friendly patriotic production increase and economy competition challenge to fine yarn workers nationwide. We believe that carrying out this competition will greatly promote the further in-depth and widespread popularization of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and the completion of production increase and economy tasks. A special notice is issued to all levels of committees to immediately organize fine yarn workers in all localities to carefully study the challenge conditions of the Hao Jianxiu Group, propose specific and practical competition conditions with the further promotion and consolidation of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" as the main content, rise up and accept the challenge, and establish a regular inspection system in the competition, in order to actively launch the production increase and economy drive nationwide on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and strive to realize Chairman Mao's great call for production increase and economy, and to overfulfill the task of increasing production and saving 37,844 billion yuan in the textile industry!
