    Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    Poland's First Automobile Factory
    Near Żerań, a suburb of Warsaw, the Polish capital, a new and large-scale automobile manufacturing plant has now appeared. At 2:00 PM on November 6th last year, this factory produced its first car—the "Warsaw M-20" passenger car, which is also the first self-made automobile in Poland.
    During the era when capitalists and feudal landlords ruled Poland, Żerań was the poorest area near Warsaw. There were only dilapidated houses and dark streets, and many unemployed workers lived in hunger and poverty here. But after Poland's liberation, Żerań's appearance has been changing day by day with the revival of the entire Warsaw; today it has become a new and prosperous industrial area near Warsaw.
    In December 1948, when the Polish Workers' Party held a joint conference, in order to meet the needs of the rapid development of Poland's national economy and the ever-improving living standards of the people, it was decided to start building Poland's own automobile industry, to build a giant automobile manufacturing plant near Warsaw, and planned to achieve an annual output of 12,000 vehicles by 1955.
    In August 1949, engineers and architects began to measure the foundations in Żerań. At the beginning of 1950, the factory's foundations were all laid. Due to the new labor attitude shown by the workers, the adoption of new construction methods, the use of new building materials, and the material and technical assistance from the Soviet Union, the entire construction project proceeded very rapidly. In less than a year and a half after construction started, three huge factory buildings were built and all the machines and equipment were installed.
    The equipment in this factory is completely modern. Most of the production process is mechanized, requiring only a small amount of manpower to work. The factory buildings and workshops are sunny and have fresh air. In order to protect the health of the workers and make them feel comfortable during labor, special attention has been paid to ventilation equipment in the welding and assembly departments, and special equipment is installed in the paint spraying room to prevent workers' lungs from being damaged. In order to ensure the material life of the workers, the factory also has a canteen, bathroom, theater and nursery. All employees live in modern residential areas near the factory.
    The Polish people are proud that their motherland can produce automobiles, and they are even more full of confidence in the victory of Poland's bright prospects for building socialism.
    Spring on the Volga-Don
    The "Volga-Don" -- a grand water conservancy project and navigable canal, the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power station and its first irrigation system, will soon be completed.
    Many goals of this great construction project have already been achieved, and the rest will be completed soon. The construction workers of the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power station built a 12.8-kilometer-long earth dam last winter. Now they are building a 500-meter-long reinforced concrete dam and installing a hydroelectric power station with three turbines.
    As early as last September, the water of the Don River had been diverted into the new riverbed. The dam filled it with a huge reservoir - the "Tsimlyansk Sea." In mid-April this year, the water level inside the embankment has risen to ten meters and continues to rise rapidly.
    The ancient dream of the farmers on the Don prairie for water has been realized. In April, the construction workers of the Tsimlyansk hydroelectric power station diverted water into the Don River main canal, from here it flowed into the Lower Don River canal, and then into the prairie. This year, irrigation of 100,000 hectares of land has begun. According to plan, the Don River water source will irrigate 2.75 million hectares of land.
    The construction of the navigable canal is also progressing rapidly. In February, the builders of the canal started the Karpovka pumping station. The powerful pumping station transports water from the Don River and its tributaries, filling the Karpovka reservoir, and then flowing into the Karpovka canal on the prairie, flowing towards the arid forest. At the end of March, the river water entered the Malinovskiy pumping station along the Karpovka riverbed. This pumping station uses a conveying pipe to send water into the canal, and concentrates it here into the Bereslavskiy reservoir. The Varvarovskiy pumping station sends water up the watershed, where the water level is 44 meters higher than the Don River. This is the third huge reservoir. From here, along the slope of the Volga River bank, the river water automatically flows near Red Army City (a district of Stalingrad), and joins the Volga River.
    The water of the Don River flows rapidly into the Volga River, and the construction workers are speeding up the completion of all work to facilitate navigation. Work on the locks is proceeding day and night. Workers are building the final concrete structures, and building and decorating the management tower. Assembly workers are assembling the machines. Arches have been built on seven of the thirteen locks. Workers are carrying out external decoration work. Two factories specialize in manufacturing building materials for decorating the canal project. Many forest scholars and horticulturists have also participated in the work. They are preparing to plant trees along the canal and cultivating seedlings in greenhouses. The Soviet people are inspired by noble and great goals.
    The Volga-Don Canal is not only grand in scale, but will also be the most beautiful in the world. At the first lock on the Don River end, a magnificent triumphal arch is being built to commemorate the victory of the heroic Soviet army in encircling and annihilating 330,000 Hitler bandits in Stalingrad.
    On the high bank at the entrance to the canal on the Stalingrad end, a magnificent statue of Stalin is being built.
    The bright sunshine shines on the Volga and Don prairies. The white clouds floating in the blue sky are reflected on the waters of the Tsimlyansk, Karpovka and Bereslavskiy reservoirs. Everywhere is full of vibrant spring water. Everywhere is an increasing number of Soviet people. This area has always been a barren wilderness with perennial drought and sparse population. However, the beautiful days are getting closer and closer: when the builders will dedicate the magnificent buildings to the Stalin era, and when the first ship will leisurely sail along the canal.

    苏联和人民民主国家的生活
    波兰的第一个汽车工厂
    在波兰首都华沙近郊的热兰地方，现在出现了一所新的规模巨大的汽车制造厂。去年十一月六日下午两点钟，这个工厂出产了它的第一辆汽车——“华沙M二十号”客车，也是波兰自制的第一辆汽车。
    在资本家和封建地主统治波兰的时代，热兰是华沙近郊最贫困的地区。那里只有破旧的房屋和阴暗的街道，许多失业工人在这里过着饥饿困苦的生活。但是在波兰解放以后，热兰的面貌就随着整个华沙的复兴而一天天地改变了；今天它已成为华沙附近的一个新兴的、繁荣的工业地区。
    一九四八年十二月，波兰工人党举行联合大会的时候，为了适应波兰国民经济迅速发展和人民生活水平日益提高的需要，决定开始建立波兰自己的汽车工业，在华沙附近兴建一所巨型的汽车制造厂，并计划要在一九五五年达到年产一万二千辆汽车的目标。
    一九四九年八月，工程师和建筑师开始在热兰测量地基，一九五○年初，工厂的地基就全部奠定了。由于工人们表现了新的劳动态度，在工程中采用了新的建筑方法，用了新的建筑材料，并且得到了苏联在物质上和技术上的援助，整个建设工程进行得十分迅速。开工以后不到一年半的时间，就盖成了三所面积巨大的厂房，并装置好了全部机器和设备。
    这个工厂的设备完全是现代化的。生产过程大部分是机械化的，只需要少数的人力就可以工作。各个厂房、车间内部阳光充足，空气新鲜。为了保护工人们的健康，使他们在劳动时感到舒适，在焊接与装配部门特别注意到通风的设备，在喷漆房里装有特殊的设备以防止工人们的肺部受到损伤。为了保证工人们的物质生活，工厂里还设有食堂、浴室、剧场与托儿所，全部职工都住在工厂附近的现代化的住宅区中。
    波兰全国人民都以他们的祖国能够出产汽车而感到骄傲，并对波兰建设社会主义的光明远景更加充满了胜利的信心。
    伏尔加河—顿河的春天
    “伏尔加河—顿河”——宏大的水利工程和通航运河，齐姆良水电站和它的第一个灌溉系统，不久就要竣工了。
    这个伟大建筑工程的许多目标业已实现，其余部分也即将完成。齐姆良水电站的建筑工人在去年冬天就筑好了长十二点八公里的土堤，如今他们正在修建长五百公尺的铁筋混凝土的堵水坝，并装设三个涡轮机的水电站。
    还在去年九月，顿河的水就已经导入新的河床。堵水坝使它注满了巨大的水库——“齐姆良海”。今年四月中旬，堤内的水平线已升高到十公尺，并继续迅速高涨。
    顿河草原上的农民对于水的古老梦想已经实现了。四月间，齐姆良水电站的建筑工人把水导入顿河基干水渠，从这里又流进下顿河水渠，然后注入草原。今年已开始灌溉十万公顷的土地，按计划顿河水源将灌溉二百七十五万公顷的土地。
    通航运河的工程，也在日新月异地进行着。运河的建筑者，在二月间开动了卡尔波夫卡抽水站。这个强大的唧水站输送的顿河水和支流的水，注满了卡尔波夫卡水库后，又流进草原上的卡尔波夫卡水渠中，流向干旱的森林。三月末，河水沿着卡尔波夫卡河床进入马林诺夫斯基抽水站。这个抽水站用输送管把水送入运河，并从这里集中到别列斯拉夫斯克水库。瓦尔瓦罗夫斯克抽水站把水送上分水岭，这里的水平线比顿河水面高四十四公尺。这是第三个巨大的水库。从这里沿着伏尔加河岸的斜坡，河水自动地流到红军城（斯大林格勒市的一个区）附近，和伏尔加河会合。
    顿河的水湍急地流入伏尔加河，建筑工人正在加紧完成一切工作，以便通航。水闸上的工作不分昼夜地进行着。工人正在修筑最后的混凝土建筑，并修筑和装饰管理塔。装配工人正在装配机器。在十三个水闸中的七个水闸上已修好拱门。工人们正在进行外表的装饰工作。有两个工厂专门制造装饰运河工程用的建筑材料。许多森林学者和园艺学者也参加了工作，他们正准备沿着运河栽植树木，并在温室内培育花苗。崇高而伟大的目标鼓舞着苏联人民。
    伏尔加河—顿河运河不仅规模宏大，而且将是世界上最美丽的。在顿河这一端的头一个水闸上，建筑着雄壮的凯旋门，以纪念英雄的苏军在斯大林格勒包围和歼灭三十三万希特勒匪军的胜利。
    在运河的斯大林格勒这一端的入口处的高岸上，建筑着雄伟的斯大林塑像。
    灿烂的阳光照耀在伏尔加河和顿河的草原上。碧蓝天空里飘动着的白云，映照在齐姆良、卡尔波夫卡和别列斯拉夫斯克水库的水面上。到处都是充沛着生命力的春水。到处都是日益增多的苏维埃人群。这儿自古以来就是常年亢旱、人烟寥寥的荒野。然而美丽的日子一天天地近了：那时候建筑者将把壮丽的建筑物奉献给斯大林时代，那时候第一艘轮船将沿着运河悠然驶来。
