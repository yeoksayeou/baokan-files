The US Side's Sabotage of the Korean Negotiations Reaches a New Peak

In the Korean armistice negotiations, there is now only one obstacle preventing both sides from reaching a final agreement and preventing the world's people's fervent desire for the restoration of peace in Korea from being realized at an early date. This is the unreasonable demand of the American aggressors to forcibly detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel.

In the past few days, the chief US negotiator, Joy, the commander of the US invading forces in Korea, Ridgway, and US President Truman have successively issued shameless clamors, attempting to force our side to "accept in full" their barbaric and unreasonable so-called "overall solution." What is the US side's so-called "overall solution"? This is the US side's continued insistence on its absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation" on the "repatriation of prisoners of war issue," while forcing the "restriction of airport equipment issue" and the "neutral nation nomination issue," which are no longer issues, together with the "repatriation of prisoners of war issue" in an attempt to deceive the world. However, everyone knows that in order to satisfy the urgent desire of the world's people for an early realization of the Korean armistice, our side proposed a reasonable and compromise overall plan on May 2. This indicated that our side was willing to accept the US side's proposed plan of forming a Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with four neutral countries on the neutral nation nomination issue, provided that the US side accepted our side's reasonable and compromise solution to the POW issue and abandoned its demand to interfere in our internal affairs by restricting airport equipment in Korea. Now that our side has made concessions on the neutral nation nomination issue, and the US side itself has had to admit that the issue of restricting airport equipment is not actually an issue and has expressed its intention to lift the restrictions on the construction of airports, the issues of neutral nation nomination and restriction of airport equipment have, in effect, been resolved and are no longer issues. Thus, the only remaining obstacle to reaching a complete agreement in the armistice negotiations is the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war. As long as the US side can abandon its absurd method of so-called "voluntary repatriation," which attempts to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel, and accept our side's reasonable compromise overall plan, a complete agreement in the Korean armistice negotiations can be reached immediately. However, the US side stubbornly clings to its so-called "overall solution," attempting to use this "smuggling method" to slip its absurd method of "voluntary repatriation" through along with the issue of neutral nation nomination and restriction of airport equipment, which have already been basically resolved. Our side has long seen through this shameless attempt by the US side, and their "smuggling method" will absolutely not work. Recently, at the negotiation meetings, the US side, in order to promote this "smuggling method," has arrogantly and unreasonably refused to negotiate, refused to reason, and threatened to suspend the meetings. The Korean negotiations have thus once again fallen into a state of tension. People can clearly see that the American aggressors are clearly deliberately delaying, and even willing to sabotage, the Korean negotiations in order to continue to prolong the Korean War and expand the international tension desired by the United States.

While the American aggressors continue to play the trick of "voluntary repatriation" at the Korean armistice negotiation meetings, they are intensifying their persecution of our captured personnel in the POW camps. On April 16, the US military authorities in Korea announced that they were transferring a portion of our captured personnel from the US military POW camp on Geoje Island to other locations for strict isolation in order to continue to forcibly conduct "screening." After our captured personnel launched a heroic resistance against this, and indignantly detained Dodd, the US POW camp commander who was directly persecuting our captured personnel, on May 7, Ridgway, the commander of the US invading forces in Korea, openly ordered on May 9 that "all force be used" in preparation for a more brutal massacre of our captured personnel than before. We, the Chinese and Korean people, absolutely cannot tolerate this; our chief delegate, General Nam Il, was ordered at the negotiation meeting on the 10th to issue a serious warning to the US side, demanding that the US side take full responsibility for the safety of our captured personnel.

The atrocities repeatedly committed by the American aggressors against our captured personnel fully expose how hypocritical and shameless their so-called "moral and humanitarian principles" towards prisoners of war are. The people of the world can see that the purpose of the US side's forcible detention of our captured personnel is entirely to massacre and enslave our captured personnel on a large scale. The barbaric and bloodthirsty attempt of the American aggressors will absolutely not achieve its goal; their crime of delaying and sabotaging the Korean negotiations cannot escape the righteous condemnation of the world's people.

The People of the Whole World Rise Up to Demand Sanctions Against US Germ Warfare Crimes

The recently published confessions and broadcasts of US Air Force Second Lieutenants Enoch and Quinn, who were captured by our side, have once again exposed the inside story of the American aggressors' germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people, bringing the day of judgment for the American aggressors' heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare ever closer.

Enoch and Quinn are powerful witnesses to the American aggressors' germ warfare. They not only confessed to the crime of personally dropping germ bombs and slaughtering the Korean people; they also confessed that the American aggressors began conducting germ warfare against Korea as early as January 1 this year. Their confessions further reveal that the American aggressors' vicious plan to conduct germ warfare was carried out under conditions of extreme secrecy. In order to conceal their inhumane and exterminating crimes, the American aggressors referred to germ bombs as "non-exploding bombs," and the lessons on germ warfare given to US Air Force personnel were also conducted in secret. All of this proves that even the American aggressors themselves are very clear that the evil deeds they are carrying out are criminal acts that cannot be seen in the light of day.

The new evidence of the American aggressors' germ warfare revealed by the American prisoners Enoch and Quinn has made the American germ warfare criminals even more panicked. US Secretary of State Acheson made a shameless statement on May 7, still attempting to continue to deny the US's crime of conducting germ warfare. However, Acheson, in addition to once again repeating his denial, could not provide any facts to prove that the evidence of the US's germ warfare confessed by these two American prisoners was not true. Moreover, until now, Acheson, in addition to flatly denying the US's crimes, still has not said a word to condemn germ warfare. People can clearly see the shameless faces of the American germ warfare criminals in Acheson.

The American aggressors' heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people are irrefutable and cannot be denied. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, stated in his reply to the Editor-in-Chief of the French newspaper *l'Humanité*, Cachin, regarding the question of US imperialism's germ warfare: "The current US government is the first user of atomic bombs and germ bombs, and it will receive its due verdict in human history." All just humanity is clamoring for a final judgment on the US's germ warfare crimes based on the increasingly complete evidence of the US's germ warfare.

Strengthen Cultural Exchange, Defend World Peace

Just as the American aggressors are frantically conducting germ warfare, seriously threatening human civilization and security, the people of our country are making new and great efforts to strengthen cultural exchange and peaceful and friendly relations between the peoples of all countries.

On May 4, the people of our country responded to the call of the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council regarding the celebration of the great cultural anniversaries and held commemorative meetings for the four great world cultural figures—Avicenna, Hugo, da Vinci, and Gogol—who made great contributions to the cause of world peace, democracy, and progress, in the capital Beijing and major cities throughout the country. The reason we are commemorating these four world cultural figures is that they are all the most outstanding representatives of human culture, and they devoted their lives to the struggle to pursue science and truth, oppose violence and tyranny, and strive for the freedom and happy lives of the broad masses of the people. Their great contributions to human culture have become the most valuable cultural heritage of all mankind. It is still an indispensable source of encouragement for the people of all nations in their struggle to win peace, democracy, and progress. Its inspiring effect on the people of our country, who are standing on the front lines of the struggle against US germ warfare together with the Korean people, is even greater.

At the same time, our cultural cooperation with the people's democratic countries is also constantly strengthening. The Central People's Government of our country and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic signed the Sino-Czech Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Sino-Czech Postal Agreement, the Sino-Czech Telecommunications Agreement, and the Sino-Czech Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement in Beijing on May 6. These agreements are of great significance for the development of cultural and economic cooperation between China and Czechoslovakia. In addition, the Hungarian National People's Cultural Troupe has come to our country to perform in various places; the first film from the German Democratic Republic dubbed in Chinese, "Daily Bread," has begun to be shown in major cities in our country. The increasing cultural relations between our country and the fraternal countries have opened up infinitely bright prospects for friendly cooperation between each other. The strengthening of cultural cooperation between our country and the people's democratic countries embodies the will of the people of these countries to fight for world peace and build a happy life for the people; it has set a good example for the struggle of the people of all countries to strengthen cultural exchange and defend world peace.

Recently, the Indian Cultural Delegation and the Burmese Cultural Delegation are also visiting our country. The Indian Art Exhibition opened in Beijing on May 10. The Sino-Burmese Friendship Association was officially established in Beijing on May 11. These activities, as well as the visit of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to India and Burma last year, have created a new and good beginning and development for cultural exchange between our country and the countries of Asia. The efforts of the people of Asian countries for cultural exchange under the same desire to oppose foreign aggressors, establish their own national independence and happy lives, and establish friendly cooperation between countries will help Asian peace and world peace.

    美方破坏朝鲜谈判达到新高峰
    在朝鲜停战谈判中，现在只有一个障碍，阻碍着双方达成最后协议，使世界人民对于恢复朝鲜和平的热烈愿望不能早日实现，这就是美国侵略者蛮横坚持其强迫扣留我方十万以上被俘人员的无理要求。
    这几天，美方谈判首席代表乔埃、侵朝美军总司令李奇微和美国总统杜鲁门接连发出无耻的叫嚣，企图强迫我方“全盘接受”其野蛮无理的所谓“全盘解决办法”。美方的所谓“全盘解决办法”是个什么东西呢？这就是美方在“遣返战俘问题”上，依然坚持其所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，而把已经不成问题了的“限制机场设备问题”和“中立国提名问题”硬与“遣返战俘问题”混在一起，以欺骗世人。但是，谁都知道，我方为了满足世界人民要求早日实现朝鲜停战的迫切愿望，在五月二日已提出一个合理折衷的全面方案，表明我方愿在美方接受我方对战俘问题的合理折衷的解决方案，并放弃其限制朝鲜境内机场设备的干涉我方内政的要求的条件下，在中立国提名问题上考虑接受美方所提出的、以四个中立国家组成中立国监察委员会的方案。现在，我方既然已在中立国提名问题上作了让步，美方自己也不得不承认限制机场设备问题其实并不是一个问题，而表示要取消对修建机场的限制，因此，中立国提名问题和限制机场设备问题实际上已经解决，已经不成其为问题了。这样，剩下来的唯一障碍停战谈判达成完全协议的就只是遣返战俘问题了。只要美方能放弃其妄图强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬办法，接受我方的合理折衷的全面方案，朝鲜停战谈判立刻就可以达成全部协议。然而，美方却死抱着其所谓“全盘解决办法”不放，妄图用这个“走私的办法”，把其“自愿遣返”的荒谬办法夹在已经在基本上解决了的中立国提名问题和限制机场设备问题一起，混过关去。美方这种无耻的企图早被我方看穿了，他们的“走私的办法”是绝对行不通的。最近在谈判会议上，美方因为要推销这种“走私的办法”，竟骄横无赖地拒绝协商，拒绝说理，并威胁要停止会议。朝鲜谈判因而再度陷入紧张状态。人们可以清楚地看出：美国侵略者显然是蓄意拖延甚至不惜破坏朝鲜谈判，来继续延长朝鲜战争，扩大美国所企求的国际紧张局势。
    美国侵略者一面在朝鲜停战谈判会议上继续玩弄“自愿遣返”的把戏，一面变本加厉地在俘虏营中继续迫害我方被俘人员。侵朝美军当局于四月十六日宣布，它正在把一部分我方被俘人员自巨济岛美军战俘营中运送他处，严密隔离，以继续强迫进行“甄别”；在我方被俘人员对此进行英勇反抗，并于五月七日激愤地扣留了直接迫害我方被俘人员的美方战俘营长官杜德准将之后，侵朝美军总司令李奇微竟于五月九日公然下令“采取一切武力”，准备对我方被俘人员进行比以前更为残暴的屠杀。我们中朝人民对此绝对不能容忍；我方首席代表南日将军已于十日的谈判会议上，奉命向美方提出严重警告，要美方对我被俘人员的安全负完全的责任。
    美国侵略者一再对我方被俘人员所施行的暴行，充分暴露了他们对待战俘的所谓“道义和人道原则”是如何的虚伪和无耻。世界人民都可以看出：美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的目的，完全是为了要大规模地屠杀和奴役我方被俘人员。美国侵略者的这种野蛮嗜血的企图，是绝对达不到目的的；他们拖延和破坏朝鲜谈判的罪行是逃不脱世界人民的正义指责的。全世界人民纷起要求制裁美国细菌战罪行
    最近发表的、被我方俘掳的美国空军中尉伊纳克和奎恩的供词和广播词，再次揭穿了美国侵略者对中朝人民发动细菌战的黑幕，而使美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行遭受裁判的日子更加临近了。
    伊纳克和奎恩是美国侵略者进行细菌战的有力见证人。他们不仅供认了曾经亲手投下细菌弹，屠杀朝鲜人民的罪行；而且招供了美国侵略者早在今年一月一日就开始对朝鲜进行了细菌战。他们的供词更使人看出：美国侵略者进行细菌战的恶毒计划是在极端秘密的情况下进行的。为了掩饰其违反人道、灭绝人性的罪行，美国侵略者把细菌弹称为“不爆炸的炸弹”，对美国空军人员讲授关于细菌战的课程也是秘密进行的。这些都证明了：即使美国侵略者自己也非常清楚，他们进行的罪恶勾当是不能见天日的犯罪的行为。
    美国俘虏伊纳克和奎恩所揭露的美国侵略者进行细菌战的新的罪证，已使美国细菌战犯们更加恐慌。美国国务卿艾奇逊在五月七日发表了无耻谈话，仍图继续抵赖美国进行细菌战的罪行。然而，艾奇逊除掉再一次重复他抵赖的滥调以外，他不能举出任何事实来证明这两名美国俘虏所供认的美国进行细菌战的罪证不是事实。而且直到现在为止，艾奇逊除掉矢口抵赖美国的罪行以外，依然没有一句话表示要谴责细菌战。人们从艾奇逊身上可以清楚地看到美国细菌战罪犯的无耻嘴脸。
    美国侵略者向中朝人民进行细菌战的滔天罪行，已经铁证如山，不容抵赖了。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若，在对法国人道报总编辑加香所提的关于美帝国主义进行细菌战问题的答复中指出：“美国现政府是原子弹与细菌弹的首先使用者，在人类史上它将获得应分的定谳。”全体正义人类正纷纷要求根据日益完备的关于美国进行细菌战的罪证，对美国细菌战罪行进行最后的裁判。加强文化交流，保卫世界和平
    正当美国侵略者疯狂地进行细菌战，严重地威胁着人类的文明和安全的时候，我国人民为加强各国人民之间的文化交流与和平友好关系正作着新的巨大的努力。
    五月四日，我国人民响应世界和平理事会维也纳会议关于庆祝伟大的文化周年纪念的决议的号召，在首都北京和全国各大城市举行了对世界和平、民主和进步事业有过巨大贡献的世界四大文化名人——阿维森纳、雨果、达·芬奇、果戈理的纪念大会。我们所以要纪念这四位世界文化名人，是因为他们都是人类文化的最优秀的代表，他们把一生都奉献给追求科学和真理，反对暴力和专制，争取广大人民的自由和幸福的生活的斗争。他们在人类文化上的巨大贡献，已成为全人类最宝贵的文化遗产。它至今对于各民族人民争取和平、民主和进步的事业的斗争，依然是一种不可缺少的鼓舞力量。它对于今天和朝鲜人民一起站在反对美国细菌战斗争最前线的我国人民的鼓舞作用更为重大。
    与此同时，我国与各人民民主国家之间的文化合作也在不断地加强。我国中央人民政府和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府之间于五月六日在北京签订了中捷文化合作协定、中捷邮政协定、中捷电信协定和中捷科学与技术合作协定，这些协定对于发展中捷两国间的文化和经济的合作具有重大的意义。此外，匈牙利国家人民文工团已来我国在各地举行了表演；第一部译成华语对白的德意志民主共和国影片“每日的粮食”已在我国各大城市开始上演。我国与各兄弟国家之间日益增多的文化关系，给彼此之间的友好合作开辟了无限光明的前途。我国与各人民民主国家之间文化合作的加强，正体现了这些国家的人民为争取世界和平，建设人民的幸福生活而斗争的意志；给世界各国人民加强彼此之间的文化交流，保卫世界和平的斗争，树立了良好的榜样。
    最近，印度文化代表团和缅甸文化代表团也正在我国进行访问。印度艺术展览会已于五月十日在北京揭幕。中缅友好协会已于五月十一日在北京正式成立。这些活动及去年我国文化代表团访问印度和缅甸，使我国与亚洲各国之间的文化交流有了新的良好的开端和发展。亚洲各国人民在反对外国侵略者、建立各自的民族独立与幸福生活和建立各国之间的友好合作的相同愿望下，对文化交流的努力，将有助于亚洲的和平和世界的和平。
