To Serve the People Better
Ding Ling

Ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out a clear path for our literary and artistic work and creation, a Marxist-Leninist path, which solved the long-term fundamental problems and the current practical problems in literature and art. Many people who thought they had been proletarianized, many who were close to the revolution, and those who doubted the revolution, all realized their confused ideas, their unstable positions, and the dark thoughts of impure Party spirit from this speech. Everyone re-examined themselves after this speech and carried out self-transformation ideologically. At that time, after a painful learning process of more than a year, this speech was more clearly accepted by many literary and artistic workers. However, the significance of this speech and its relationship to reality can only be deeply understood in the subsequent practice, after participating in the struggle in the mass life with revolutionary feelings; and truly grasping its entire spirit and correctly implementing it still requires arduous and long-term efforts. Over the past ten years, we have achieved great successes, and there have also been some deviations and errors. We must use the principles and laws of literary and artistic problems pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong to constantly analyze the various experiences we have gained and the new problems that have arisen, and constantly study the correctness of our implementation or the deviations in our understanding. If we do not do this, and are self-righteous, we will inevitably go astray personally, and as leaders, we will make serious mistakes.

Comrade Mao Zedong's speech does not require everyone to verbally acknowledge it as a great classic document, but requires every literary and artistic worker, especially those who are responsible for leadership and influential writers among the masses, to use it as a compass for daily work, use it as a weapon, and repeatedly think and specifically analyze in all concrete practices. We must oppose treating Comrade Mao Zedong's works with the dogmatic attitude that Comrade Mao Zedong opposed. If we simply and abstractly derive a few concepts from this document and think that we have a magic weapon that can be used to solve all complex and delicate problems in literary and artistic creation, we will definitely run into walls. Comrade Mao Zedong gave us this warning long ago.

Judging from the fact that a film like "The Life of Wu Xun" could be produced and released last year, and that it was not immediately criticized by the literary and artistic circles after its release; judging from the problems exposed in the rectification and study movement and the "Three-Anti" movement in the Beijing literary and artistic circles that began last November, the literary and artistic workers did not learn this document well, or have forgotten what they had learned. After entering the city, the phenomenon of abandoning leadership appeared in literary and artistic work, abandoning the idea of taking the working class ideology as the leadership, and not only lost the ability to criticize the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological tastes and their arrogant propaganda, but even seemed to get along quite comfortably with them. We have heard arguments that obliterate some of our good works with bourgeois tastes, and we have also heard speeches that demand being interesting, to cater to the low-level tastes of the petty bourgeoisie and small citizens. These arguments have fulfilled the obligation of serving the bourgeoisie. Many of our young comrades have taken detours, partly because of their unstable positions and partly because of the influence of these erroneous arguments. This phenomenon, even after literary and artistic rectification and study, is still a serious problem remaining in our current literary and artistic work. On the point of eliminating the influence of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, we must adhere to criticism and self-criticism, and should never condone this erroneous tendency or give it sympathy. This issue has been discussed more and exposed more recently, and I do not intend to talk about it further. I want to talk about some other aspects of the issue.

Most of us, a large group of literary and artistic workers who have worked in the liberated areas for a relatively long time, from the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art to today, have strived to practice the literary and artistic direction indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, going to life, participating in armed struggles, participating in land reforms, participating in industrial construction, living and working with soldiers, learning the language of the masses, and making various efforts to write various works, with the exception of a very few people. On the one hand, we have indeed made many achievements in our work, but on the other hand, our creations have always failed to improve, and have always failed to meet the demands of the masses. There are not many works that we have been able to stand by over the past ten years. We have rarely written works that deeply move readers, so that readers naturally develop love and hatred in their hearts when reading our works, and naturally demand action, and demand to learn from the characters in the works, like the protagonists in "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "A Real Man". We cannot write the events in the works in a grand and soul-stirring way, so that readers yearn for them, and are willing to dedicate themselves to the new society, to the motherland, to new people, and to the lovable people who labor. Ten years have passed, but after checking from all aspects, it always feels that there is too little progress. Today, many people, especially young literary and artistic workers, are distressed by this problem. What is the reason? Then, is it necessary for us to examine whether there are errors in our past understanding, our practice, our views and practices, and whether they are in line with Comrade Mao Zedong's thought? I think it is necessary. Then, I will put forward a few points for everyone to study.

First, regarding the theme. What is the theme? It is a central issue reflected and resolved in the work. The theme of a work can reveal the ideological level of the writer, that is, to see whether the author pays attention to and cares about the important contradictions in the people's lives today or the trivial and unimportant contradictions; whether the solution of this contradiction is the new defeating the old, or whether it is propaganda for the old. The most important themes we need to reflect today are the anti-imperialist struggle, the class struggle, and the struggle between the new and the old in national construction. What we usually say about writing about land reform, writing about resisting America and aiding Korea, writing about the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and writing about industrial construction refers to this. To solve these major struggle problems, there can be countless themes, and materials can be drawn from various angles. In the past, many of us confused the theme with the subject matter, thinking that with a theme, we could create. The writer first has an abstract theme, and then goes to the ocean of life to find materials, and according to the subjective needs of the writer or the leadership, grabs some scattered life on the edge of the life they are close to, and then constructs a work with a "great" theme out of thin air. We can easily find examples of failures in this kind of creative method.

The concepts that scientists summarize after studying the real struggle life are theories. Writers should know these theories because they can help writers understand life and clearly form themes. However, for the writer to truly obtain this theme, they must also go through the practice of life, rely on themselves to obtain rich perceptual knowledge, and must also observe and study individual things, have new discoveries, and must grasp this theme through concrete life images, and then use the activities of the characters in the events to meticulously write the profound contradictions, and write how to rely on the forces of new development to resolve the contradictions. Literary works write about certain positive themes, not to tell people some theories, some concepts. Scientific papers will analyze more systematically and do better. Literature is meant to move people. Writers must enable readers to experience what the writer has experienced in life, must enable readers to feel life the same way as the writer, and feel and experience the problems in life, helping readers improve, deepen, and supplement some of the theories they accept daily. Therefore, creation can never simply start from the theme.

Some people say that starting from the theme can also produce great works. That is because they do not yet understand the process that creation must go through, even the most important process. Some people are taking this approach now, and occasionally some works are written that are praised by the general public. However, these praises are nothing more than "the theme is correct," but you have never heard anyone say that the character inside is too touching, that life is too intimate; such works will slowly be forgotten. Like "Water Margin," a great work, it certainly has its good theme, but what is circulating everywhere and everyone is talking about is the Flowery Monk Lu Zhishen, the tiger-slaying Wu Song, the Black Whirlwind Li Kui,...Readers come into contact with the theme of this book from these vivid characters in "Water Margin."

It is necessary to remind writers of the importance of understanding the correct theme in the work, but writers must strive to grasp the correct theme in life, in the practice of mass struggle, and in self-struggle. Writers recognize the main contradictions and the main aspects of the contradictions in real life with the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory, so as to avoid being like a blind man riding a blind horse, rushing around and groping in the ocean of life, and getting nothing; but if they think that they can only rely on a few abstract themes, starting from this, piecing together some impressions and materials, and then start to create, they are bound to fail.

Simply saying that great works can also be written starting from the theme is very one-sided. This argument has influenced the way of life of some literary and artistic workers in collecting materials and interviewing materials. For some people who are unwilling to go deep into life for a long time and are not determined to transform themselves, it seems to help them take shortcuts, but in fact, how many people have followed detours!

Second, regarding "typical characters". The main thing in a work is to write about characters. What is active in the work is people, the thoughts of people, the contradictions between people and things, the contradictions between people, and the contradictions of people themselves. All problems are expressed through the behavior of people. To write about characters clearly and prominently is to write about the personality of people. To fully express the personality of concrete characters, we must use many, many daily lives to let the characters move in them, and to make the characters have various ways of expression in diverse events, and this also needs to express the consistency of his personality. In this way, the outline of the character can be clear, and the character can be as alive as if they really exist. If this kind of character is written well, and it feels as if there really is such a person to the reader, and the reader connects the character in the work with the character in life, and he discovers the character obtained from the work in his later life, this kind of character becomes typical and has its typicality. Typicality comes from personality, and it requires writers to observe and be familiar with all kinds of people in life, and then create a representative character. This character should have his own strong personality. Therefore, true typical characters come from life. If the writer does not have a rich life, and does not have many characters that he has obtained from life, he cannot write anything, let alone typical characters.

However, how do some people tell young people to create characters? First, they tell them to write "typical characters." Everyone first studies the typicality and commonality of characters in the room, what a hero should be like, and what a corrupt person should be like. After studying the common characteristics that they should have, the more generalized the better, and then decide which one should be the main one and which one should be the auxiliary one in the work. These characters have already been stereotyped and facialized before they have been written. Therefore, these characters are obtained from meetings and newspaper materials. We see that there are indeed various "typical characters" in many works, representing the progressive, the backward, the intermediate...But they are too "typical," so "typical" that they are like dead people, without any living breath. These characters are all moving according to subjective concepts. The thoughts, words, and deeds of the characters are the most formulaic results of the meeting. After this kind of work is finished, the theorists of "typical characters" have to say "conceptualization."

Why are there so many "typical characters" but lacking living characters in our works? What is the reason? Since it starts from the concept, how can we not get conceptualized results? The calls for writing about transformed characters, writing about heroes, etc., that we often hear often fall into a lack of analysis, a lack of concrete guidance, only taking care of subjective needs, and forgetting that writers should start from fundamental issues.

Third, regarding "ideology and policy." People often ask: What is ideology, how can we have ideology, and how can we improve the ideology in our works? I think we have demanded, spurred, and criticized in the past, but we have not explained, or explained very simply. For example: "Ideology is policy, to have ideology is to write policy, ideology is policy." Therefore, when we write about industry, we write about industrial policy, write about labor-management benefits, and write about public-private partnership; when we write about land reform, we write about how to classify classes, how to divide components, how to unite middle peasants, and how to develop a series of production policies. When writing about the army, we write about strategic thinking. Therefore, our works are often filled with policies and regulations. People ask a work to solve many problems, to explain why there should be this policy, what this policy contains, and its correctness, etc., but it is always difficult for a work to say all of this completely. This is indeed not something that writers can handle. The writer takes the instructions of the Central Committee and awkwardly explains them with some individual stories, and uses the characters' lines to give speeches. How can they explain it clearly? The writer originally intended to achieve complete ideology, but the result still feels too shallow, too low, and without content. Because he only did a clumsy translation of some instructions. This method is not right.

I think ideology is the reflection of the writer's world view and outlook on life in the work. Proletarian revolutionary writers should have selfless character and style, and the lofty ideal of struggling for the cause of communism, and be able to use the scientific method of Marxism-Leninism to analyze and study the contradictions in life and draw correct conclusions. The work should give people a correct concept, use the ideas of the working class to influence readers, so that readers will develop infinite feelings for the cause of the working class and the beautiful prospects of mankind after reading this work. It should expand the reader's vision and mind. Improve their qualities of serving the people. To make the work ideological, it is not enough to rely on some book knowledge. Writers cannot simply accept some theories synthesized by others as their own ideas, and it is impossible to directly transform scientific theories into images. Writers must practice, go to life to verify, and seek to be richer and deeper. Therefore, ideology is not borrowed hard, cannot be applied, cannot be faked, and cannot be suddenly acquired. This requires the writer to have extensive knowledge, correct ideological methods, the position of the working class, rich life experience, and repeatedly combine practice and theory, and gradually cultivate and enrich his own class feelings, so that his breath is consistent with the masses, and he sees more comprehensively and farther than the masses. Only after painful self-ideological transformation and long-term hard and honest labor can this be achieved. There is no shortcut other than this.

As for policies, they are not clauses for people to recite. Writers can only understand policies in the struggle of the masses and in the contradictions of things. Writers must understand policies, because all life and all changes are inseparable from policies. Policies help us grasp the contradictions and methods to resolve the contradictions. Writers write about all life and all changes, and should conform to policies and be conducive to the implementation of policies, but they should never simply write about policies. We have read many works about policies, and what else can we feel besides being boring?

Fourth, regarding the "propaganda and educational role." Literature is originally a part of the revolutionary front, and its basic task is to unite the people, educate the people, and to promote the revolutionary thought of the working class to the masses. But literature is not equal to general propaganda, and it is not equal to textbooks. This principle is very simple. However, there are actually some people who do not think so now. For example, when writing about land reform, some people say: "This book does not have a complete land reform process, and it is not useful for actual land reform work," or "That book has a complete process, but it is outdated and not applicable to new areas"; when writing about the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, they say "the materials are too old"! So what can writers write? They must write about new work methods, new technologies, and new inventions. We often hear people say: "This is an advanced example. Writing it out will be useful for other places and backward areas." So this novel has a method of electric welding rods, and that book also has a method of electric welding rods. This book has a method of repairing furnaces, and that book also has a method of repairing furnaces. Some literary works, the authors flaunt some so-called specialized technologies that are mostly laymen, or explain some of the most superficial principles related to the current movement. I think explaining the policy of land reform cannot rely on writing about land reform, and the work should not take on this task. The work is not to promote advanced work methods, and it is impossible to do so. Reading "How the Steel Was Tempered" is not to learn how to write with your hands to feel the words. What is worth learning is the mind of this great character Paul Korchagin, his spirit, and his steel-like will.

Literature is ultimately different from pamphlets of current affairs propaganda. For some current movements, literary works should reflect them in a timely manner, but such works must also have some characters, some vivid language, and must say things more refined and concrete than usual; and writers are not required to only write such works and not write works with more content and more research. Writers should not follow trends. I see some people often rushing to grab materials, as if the work is the same as news, and its value will be reduced one day later. This is completely unnecessary worry. We say that our works cannot keep up with reality, and the achievements in literature are far behind the achievements in politics, economics, and military affairs. This means the quality of our works, and that the content of our works does not well reflect the great struggle of real life. Writers are going to write new things. If a writer lives among the masses, he sees new things every day, and he will naturally write about them, without the need to grab them. If a work can really be written in a way that moves people, educates people, and achieves the effect of propaganda, to write it well, the writer should still start from the life he knows best and the life that touched him personally the most. If the writer is required by the environment and the task, he should also write instructions, write working methods, write textbooks, and write leaflets. These can increase the writer's knowledge and ability, but they can never be regarded as literature and be satisfied with it.

There are many specific problems existing in the current literary and artistic creation. I cannot say them all. I think the above points are very important. This includes the issue of learning methods, the issue of learning attitudes, and the issue of understanding and implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's documents. It is still a question of following Marxism-Leninism and the method of materialist dialectics, or following dogmatism and subjective idealism. Although this kind of wrong view is not very common, it is influential and still seriously exists. We must admit that we have always done very poorly in thoroughly examining our thoughts, theories and critical work. In the past, when our literature and art were attacked by the bourgeoisie, I defended the entire achievements of worker-peasant-soldier literature and art. I wrote an article called "Stepping into a New Era." I think these defenses were correct. But on the tenth anniversary of the commemoration of Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, I have to raise the problems that I feel, those dogmatic shortcomings on the other hand that we ourselves have committed. If we do not pay attention to our consistent formalism and conceptualization while opposing bourgeois thought, then we may very well develop this tendency. Therefore, I hope that our literary and artistic circles, literary and artistic leaders, and influential writers will seriously do some research work and develop theoretical and ideological criticism and self-criticism in order to solve the distress of our many young literary and artistic workers and to make literature and art serve the people better. We must not be afraid to expose our weaknesses and bravely correct our mistakes. At the same time, I hope that many young literary and artistic workers should diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, go deep into life for a long time, do not separate learning and life from creation, eliminate dogmatic learning methods, and correct the attitude of life and writing. Liquidate the plan to use literature as a personal achievement, work honestly and diligently, and serve the people with the results of labor. We must adhere to Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and artistic direction. We must fight for this direction and all the ideas and opinions of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie that violate the interests of the people, and also fight against our own impure Party spirit, subjectivism, shoddy manufacturing and other bad tendencies. Let us hold the great banner of Comrade Mao Zedong's literature and art even higher, and strive for higher and greater achievements in our literary and artistic work!

专栏：为贯彻执行毛泽东文艺路线而斗争

    要为人民服务得更好
    丁　玲
    十年前，毛泽东同志曾经为我们的文艺工作和文艺创作，指示了一条明确的道路，马克思列宁主义的道路，解决了文学艺术上的长远的根本问题和当前的实际问题。许多自以为是已经无产阶级化了的人，许多靠近革命的和对革命怀疑着的人，都从这个讲话中认识到自己的某些糊涂观念，某些立场不稳和党性不纯的阴暗思想。大家都在这一次讲话后，再认识自己，而从思想上进行自我改造。当时经过一年多的痛苦的学习过程，这个讲话才比较明确的为许多文艺工作者所接受。但这个讲话的意义和现实的关系，只有在跟着而来的实践中，用革命的感情到群众生活中去参加斗争以后，才能得到比较深刻的体会；而真正掌握住其整个精神，并正确地执行它，却还需要艰苦的长期的努力，才能做到。十年以来，我们得到了很大的成绩，也有一些偏向和错误。我们必须用毛泽东同志所指出的文艺问题的方针、规律，经常分析我们所获得的各种经验和新发生的问题，经常研究我们执行的正确或理解的偏差。如果我们不这样做，而自以为是，在个人是必然走入歧途，在领导，就会犯严重的错误。
    毛泽东同志的这个讲话，不是要求大家在口头上承认它是伟大的经典文献，却是要求每个文艺工作者，尤其是负领导责任的，在群众中有影响的作家们，把它当做日常工作的指南针，用它做武器，在
    一切具体的实践中反复思考，具体分析。我们必须反对用毛泽东同志所反对的教条主义的态度来对待他的著作，如果我们只是简单的，抽象的，从这个文件中得出几个概念，就自以为拿着了法宝，可以通行无阻，解决一切复杂的细致的文艺创作上的问题，那是一定会碰壁的。毛泽东同志老早就给过我们这个警惕。
    从去年“武训传”这样的影片能够摄制和公映，而在公映后并未立刻受到文艺界的批评这种情形看来；从去年十一月开始的北京文艺界整风学习和“三反”运动中所暴露的问题看来，文艺工作者们并没有把这个文件学好，或者是已经把他们所学到过的忘记了。在进城以后，在文艺工作中出现了放弃领导的现象，放弃了以工人阶级思想作为领导的思想，而对资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想趣味，和他们的狂妄的宣传，不特失去批判的能力，甚至是相处得颇为舒适的样子。我们听到过以资产阶级趣味来抹煞我们的某些好的作品的论调，也听到过要求趣味化，以迎合小资产阶级、小市民的低级趣味的言论。这些论调是尽到了为资产阶级服务的义务的。我们有许多年青的同志们走了弯路，一方面是由于自己的立场不稳，一方面也由于受到了这些错误论调的影响。这种现象，即使经过文艺整风学习，也还是目前我们文艺工作中残存着的严重问题。我们在肃清资产阶级、小资产阶级的影响这一点上，还必须坚持批评和自我批评，决不应该袒护这种错误倾向，或寄与同情。这个问题，近来谈得比较多，暴露得也比较多，我不打算多谈。我想谈一些另一方面的问题。
    我们这很大的一群曾较长期地在解放区中工作的文艺工作者，从延安文艺座谈会以后，到今天，除了极少数人以外，大部分都曾为着实践毛泽东同志指示的文艺方向而努力，到生活中去，参加武装斗争，参加土地改革，参加工业建设，和战士同起居，学习工作，学习群众语言，做了各种各样的努力，写了各种各样的作品。就一方面说，我们的确在工作中也有了不少的成绩，但就另一方面说，我们的创作总是不能提高，总不能满足群众对我们的要求。我们十年来比较能站得住的作品是不多的。我们还很少写出十分感动读者的作品，使读者读着我们的作品时，就自然的从心中发生爱，发生恨，自然的要求行动，要求向作品中的人物学习，像“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“真正的人”中的主人公。我们不能把作品中的事件写得轰轰烈烈，写得亲切感人，使读者向往，乐意为新的社会，为祖国，为新的人，劳动的可爱的人民而献身。已经十年过去了，可是从各方面检查起来，总觉得进步太少。今天有许多人，特别是年青的文艺工作者为着这个问题而苦闷。这个道理何在呢？那末是不是让我们来检查一下过去我们的认识，我们的实践，我们的看法和做法是否有错误，是否符合毛泽东同志的思想，我想是必要的。那末，我就举出几点来，请大家研究。
    第一，关于主题。主题是什么呢？是作品中所反映的、所解决的一个中心问题。从作品的主题是可以看出作家的思想水平的，就是看作者所注意的、关心的是今天人民生活中的重要矛盾还是琐细的无关紧要的矛盾；这个矛盾的解决是新的战胜了旧的呢，或是为旧的做了宣传。我们今天需要反映的最主要的主题是反帝斗争，是阶级斗争，是国家建设中新和旧的斗争。我们平常说写土地改革，写抗美援朝，写“三反”“五反”，写工业建设，就是指的这个。要解决这些主要斗争的问题，可以有不知多多少少的题材，可以从各种角度去取材。过去我们很多人把主题和题材混同起来，以为有了主题，就可以创作了。作家先有了一个抽象的主题，然后到生活的海洋中去找材料，按照作家或领导方面的主观需要，在他所接近的生活边缘，抓取一些零星的生活，就凭空构造一个“伟大”主题的作品。这样的创作方法，我们是不难找到失败的例子的。
    科学家把现实斗争生活研究以后，概括起来的一些观念，这是理论。这种理论，作家是应该知道的，因为它可以帮助作家去了解生活，明确地形成主题。可是作家自己要真正获得这主题，还必须通过生活的实践，靠自己取得丰富的感性认识，还必须对个别的事物进行观察和研究，有新的发现，而且须要通过具体的生活形象而把握这个主题，然后才能借助人物在事件中的活动而细致的写出深刻的矛盾，并写出怎样依靠于新的发展的力量来解决矛盾。文学作品写出了某些积极的主题，并不是告诉人一些理论，一些概念。科学的论文会分析得更有条理，做得更好。文学是要它能感动人。作家务必使读者能经验到作家在生活中所经验的，务必使读者能同作家一样去感受生活，和感觉、体会到生活中的问题，帮助读者提高，深化，补充他日常所接受的一些理论。因此创作决不能简单地从主题出发。
    有人说从主题出发也可以写出伟大作品，那是还不了解创作所必须走的过程，甚至最主要的过程。现在有些人是采取这种办法的，偶然也有写出来的作品，为一般人所称赞。但这些赞美的话不外是
    “主题正确”，可是你却从来也没有听到有人说那里边的那个人物，太感动人了，那生活太亲切了；这种作品，慢慢就会被人忘记的。像水浒传这样的伟大作品，固然有着它的好的主题，但是到处流传的，人人津津乐道的是花和尚鲁智深，是打虎的武松，是黑旋风李逵，……读者们是从水浒传中的这些活生生的人物来接触这部书的主题的。
    提醒作家必需懂得正确的主题在作品中的重要性，那是必要的，但作家必须努力在生活中，在群众斗争的实践中，在自我的斗争中去把握正确的主题。作家借马克思列宁主义理论的指导而认识现实生活中那些是主要的矛盾和主要的矛盾方面，这样就可以免得像盲人骑瞎马，乱闯乱撞，在生活的海洋中乱摸，茫茫然无所得；但如果以为只凭几个抽象的主题，由此出发，拼凑一些印象和材料，就来进行创作，那是必然要失败的。
    简单地说从主题出发也可以写出伟大作品，是带着很大的片面性的。这种论调对于某些文艺工作者的搜集材料，采访材料的生活方式，是起了影响的。对于一些不愿长期深入生活，不决心改造自己的人们，好像是帮助他们取得了捷径，但实际上却有多少人跟着走了弯路呵！
    第二，关于“典型人物”。作品主要要写出人物。作品中活动的是人，是人的思想，人和物的矛盾，人和人的矛盾，人本身的矛盾，一切问题都是通过人的行为表现出来。人物要写得分明，要写得突出，就是要写人的个性。要对于具体人物的个性有充分的表现，就要借许多许多日常的生活来让人物在其中活动，要使人物在多样的事件中有各种方式的表现，而这又要表现他的个性的一致性。这样，人物的轮廓才能分明，人物才能像活的一样。这种人物写好了，写得对于读者像真有其人一样，使读者把作品中的人物和生活中的人物联系起来，使他在以后的生活中又发现了从作品中所得来的人物，这种人物就成了典型，就有了他的典型性。典型性是从个性来的，是要作家在生活中观察，熟悉各种各样的人，然后创造一种带代表性的人物。这个人物却应有他个人强烈的个性。所以真正的典型人物是从生活中来的，作家如若没有丰富的生活，没有许多自己从生活中得来的人物，是不能写出什么人物来的，更谈不上典型。
    但是，有的人是怎样告诉年青人去创造人物的呢？是首先告诉他们要写“典型人物”。大家先在屋子里研究人物的典型性，共同性，一个英雄应该是怎样怎样的，一个贪污分子应该是怎样怎样的。研究好了他们所应该具备的共同的特点，越概括越好，然后决定在作品中以何者为主，何者为辅。这些人物还没有写出来就已经定型化了，脸谱化了。因此，这些人物是从开会中得来的，是从报纸材料中得来的。我们看见很多作品中的确有了各种“典型人物”，代表了进步的、落后的、中间的……但太“典型”了，“典型”得像死人一样，毫无活人气息，这些人物都是按主观的概念而活动的。人物的思想、言、行都是最公式化的会议的结果。这种作品写完之后，“典型人物”的理论家看了也不得不说“概念化”。
    为什么在我们的作品中会有这样多的“典型人物”而缺乏活生生的人物，其道理何在呢？既然是从概念出发，怎么能不得到概念化的结果呢？我们经常听到的写转变人物，写英雄等等号召都常陷于缺乏分析，缺乏具体指导，只顾主观需要，忘了作家应从根本的问题入手。
    第三，关于“思想和政策”。人们常常问：什么是思想性，怎么才会有思想性，如何提高我们作品中的思想性。我以为过去我们要求过，鞭策过，批评过，但没有解释过，或解释得很简单。譬如说：
    “思想性就是政策性，要有思想就要写政策，思想即政策。”因此我们写工业就写工业政策，写劳资两利，写公私兼顾；写土地改革就写如何订阶级，如何划成分，如何团结中农，如何发展生产一连串的政策。写军队就写战略思想。于是我们的作品常常充满了政策和条文。人们要求一个作品解决许多问题，得说明为什么要有这个政策，这个政策包含什么内容，以及它的正确性等等，但一个作品总是很难把这一切都说完全。这的确不是作家所能胜任的。作家拿着中央的指示，生硬地用些个别的故事来解释，借人物的道白来讲演，怎么能说得清楚呢。作家本企图达到有完满的思想性，但结果给人的感觉还是觉得太浅，太低，没有内容。因为他只做到对指示的一些蹩脚的翻译。这个办法是不对的。
    我以为思想性是作家的世界观人生观在作品中的反映。无产阶级的革命作家是应该具备大公无私的性格与作风和为共产主义事业而奋斗的崇高理想，并能够用马克思列宁主义的科学方法去分析研究生活中的矛盾，得出正确的结论。作品要给人一个正确的观念，用工人阶级的思想来影响读者，使读者读了这个作品以后会生长起来对工人阶级事业，对人类美好远景的无限感情。它要扩大读者的眼界和心胸。提高他们为人民服务的品质。作品要有思想性，仅仅依靠一些书本知识是不行的。作家不能简单地接受别人综合起来的一些理论作为自己的思想，更不可能把科学的理论直接地化为形象。作家必需去实践，到生活中去印证，并且求其更丰富和更深刻。所以思想性不是硬借来的，不是可以套用的，不是可以假装的，也不是忽然就有了的。这必须作家有广博的知识，有正确的思想方法，有工人阶级的立场，有丰富的生活经验，反复地把实践和理论相结合，逐步培养和丰富自己的阶级感情，使自己的呼吸和群众一致，而且比群众看得更全面，更远。只有经过痛苦的自我思想改造，和长期辛勤而诚实的劳动才可以做到。除此以外，是没有任何捷径的。
    至于政策，也不是供人背诵的条文。作家只能在群众的斗争中，在事物的矛盾中来体会政策。作家必须懂得政策，因为一切生活，一切变革都离不开政策，政策帮助我们来把握矛盾和解决矛盾的方法。作家写一切生活，一切变革，都应该符合政策，对政策的推行有利，但决不是简单地写政策。我们读过不少写政策的作品，除了枯燥以外，我们还能感受到什么别的么？
    第四，关于“宣传教育作用”。文学本来就是革命战线的一部分，它的基本任务，就是团结人民，教育人民，就是要把工人阶级的革命思想向群众宣传。但文学不等于一般的宣传，不等于教科书。这道理本是很浅近的。可是我们现在实际上却有人不是这样看法。譬如写土地改革吧，就有人说：“这本书，土改过程不完全，对实际土改工作没有什么用，”或者“那本书，过程是完全了，但却又过时了，对新区不适用”；写抗战，写解放战争，则说“材料太旧了”！因此作家能写些什么呢？必须写新的工作方法，新的技术，新的发明。常常听到有人说：“这是先进的例子，写出来对别的地方，对落后地区有作用。”于是这本小说中有电焊条的方法，那本书里也有电焊条的方法，这本书里有一个修理炉子的方法，那本书里也有一个修理炉子的方法。有些文学作品，作者卖弄一些其实大半是外行的所谓专门技术，或者就是讲解一些最肤浅的有关目前运动中的道理。解释土地改革的政策，我想是不能依靠写土地改革的作品的，作品不应该担负这种任务。作品也不是推广先进的工作方法的，而且也不可能做到。读“钢铁是怎样炼成的”，决不是要从书里学习如何用手摸字去写作，值得人们学的是保尔·柯察金这个伟大的人物的心灵，是他的精神，是他的钢铁般的意志。
    文学同时事宣传的小册子究竟不一样。为着当前的一些运动，文学作品应该及时有所反映，但这样的作品也必须有些人物，有些生动的语言，必定把话说得比平常更洗练些，具体些；而且也不要求作家只写这样的作品而不写比较更有内容，更有研究的作品。作家是不要赶时髦的。我看见有些人常常去抢材料，好像作品同新闻一样，迟出一天就减少了价值，这完全是多余的担心。我们说，我们的作品赶不上现实，文学上的成就还远远落后于政治的经济的军事的成就之后，意思是指我们作品的质量，是指我们作品的内容，没有很好的反映伟大的斗争的现实生活。作家是要写新鲜事物的，作家如果生活在群众之中，他每天都看见新鲜事物，他自然会写的，用不着抢。作品要真能写得感动人，教育人，起到宣传的效果，要写得好，作家还是应该从他最了解的生活，最感动了他个人的生活去动手。如果作家为了环境的需要，为了任务，他是应该也写说明书，也写工作方法，也写教科书，也写传单，这些都可以增长作家的知识和能力，但决不能把这些就当成文学，以此为满足。
    存在于目前文艺创作中的具体问题还很多，我不能全部来说，以上这几点，我以为是很重要的。这里包含着学习方法的问题，学习态度的问题，对毛泽东同志的文件理解和执行的问题。还是依照马克思列宁主义，唯物辩证法的方法，还是依照教条主义，主观的唯心的方法的问题。虽然这种错误的看法并不是很普遍，但却有影响，而且还严重地存在着。我们要承认我们彻底检查我们的思想、理论和批评工作，是从来就做得很差。过去，当我们的文艺受到资产阶级攻击的时候，我曾经为工农兵文艺的整个成就而辩护过。写了一篇文章叫“跨到新的时代来”。这些辩护，我认为是对的。但在纪念毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话十周年的今天，我却不得不提出我所感到的问题，那些关于我们自己所犯的另一方面的教条主义的缺点。如果我们不在反对资产阶级思想的同时，注意着我们向来就有的公式化、概念化，那我们将很可能发展这种倾向。所以我希望我们的文艺界、文艺领导者、有影响的作家们为着解决我们很多年青的文艺工作者的苦闷，为着使文艺为人民服务得更好而认真做起一些研究工作，和展开理论思想的批评和自我批评。我们要不怕暴露弱点，勇敢改正错误。同时我希望很多年青的文艺工作者，应该刻苦地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，长期地深入生活，不要将学习和生活，和创作隔离开来，清除教条主义的学习方法，改正生活和写作的态度。清算以文学做为个人成就的打算，老老实实地、勤勤恳恳地劳动，以劳动的成果为人民服务。我们要坚持毛泽东同志的文艺方向。要为着这个方向和资产阶级、小资产阶级的一切违反人民利益的思想言论做斗争、也要同我们自己的党性不纯、主观主义、粗制滥造等等不良倾向做斗争，让我们把毛泽东同志的文艺大旗举得更高些，为我们在文艺工作上的更高和更大的成就而努力！
