    Strengthens Leadership of Cadre Newspaper Reading Work

    Editor: The reader's letter published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on March 29th criticized my neglect of reading the newspaper. This criticism is correct. In the past, I always thought I knew enough about politics, so I relaxed my study of current events and politics, and buried myself in business work. Occasionally, when someone asked about my study situation, I would emphasize "no time" and "busy with work." Because I am the leader of this organization, this erroneous thinking seriously affected other cadres, so most of the comrades in the entire depot neglected reading the newspaper.

    In order to change this bad trend, we held a meeting of all comrades in the depot at the beginning of April; after the meeting, we immediately organized a newspaper reading group and added a current affairs Q&A column to the wall newspaper. Since its implementation, everyone has unanimously agreed that this method is very good, especially for comrades with lower levels of education. I am very grateful for the criticism from the Party newspaper.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市第一粮栈马苏民
    对干部读报工作加强领导
    编辑同志：三月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载读者来信，对我忽视读报提出了批评，这一批评是正确的。过去，我总认为自己对政治已经知道得差不多了，因而放松了时事和政治学习，埋头于业务工作。偶尔有人问起我的学习情况，我就强调“没有时间”、“工作忙”。因为我是这个机构的领导人，这种错误思想严重地影响了其他干部，所以，全栈大部分同志都是忽视读报的。
    为了改变这种不良倾向，四月初我们全栈同志开了一个会；会后，立即组织了读报组，并在壁报上增设了时事问答栏。实行以来，大家一致认为这办法很好，特别是对于文化水平较低的同志。我非常感激党报的批评。
