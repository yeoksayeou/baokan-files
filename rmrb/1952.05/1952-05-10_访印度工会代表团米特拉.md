Interview with Mitra of the Indian Trade Union Delegation

We interviewed Mitra, head of the All-India Trade Union Association delegation invited to our country to attend the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations, Chairman of the Indian Automobile Industry and Transport Workers Union, and Chairman of the Assam Plantation Workers Union.

After participating in the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations, Mitra had many thoughts. He summarized these thoughts by saying: From such a large parade, I saw that whether it was young or old, whether it was workers, peasants, national bourgeoisie, or various ethnic minorities, they all showed spontaneous enthusiasm and demonstrated strict organization and discipline, which fully reflected the unity of the entire Chinese people. In this great scene, I also personally witnessed the love and respect of the broad masses of the Chinese people for their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, which deeply moved me.

Along the way to Beijing and after arriving in Beijing, they had already seen many new things. He described his impressions, saying: "First of all, I saw the true equality of men and women in China. Chinese women have gone to various posts to participate in work. Secondly, there is the New China's concern for children's education, and facilities related to children's education can be seen everywhere. For example, we saw this aspect of equipment in several places in the park. The full use of land in Chinese rural areas, with crops growing on every inch of land, although Chinese agriculture is not yet mechanized. In addition, the respect shown to laborers everywhere also gave me a deep impression."

After visiting Renmin University, he felt that the organization and teaching system of Renmin University were very prominent. It is a place to cultivate young cadres in various fields in a planned way according to the needs of the government's industrial construction, which is also one of the new things for him.

Mitra talked about the Indian people's movement to defend world peace. He said that although the Indian people's peace movement is not yet a fully organized movement, if a war breaks out anywhere, the Indian people, especially the workers, will definitely stand up to stop it. Because the Indian people are enthusiastically and urgently demanding peace, demanding to maintain domestic peace, and demanding to maintain international peace. He said: "I also realize that the Chinese people's desire to defend peace is very enthusiastic, because the Chinese people have deeply realized that to build a new China, there must be a peaceful environment. During the 'May Day' parade, I clearly saw the Chinese people's desire for peace."

The two great nations of China and India have a traditional friendship. Mitra talked with great interest about how to further enhance the friendship between the two peoples in the future. He hopes that the two peoples can regularly send delegations to exchange culture and gain a deeper understanding of each other. He said that a university in Bolpur, India, has a special department that teaches Chinese writing and language, and studies and introduces Chinese literature and art. He hopes that Chinese universities will also add professors to teach Indian literature, which can promote and develop mutual friendship. Speaking of this, he talked about the gains from this visit to China. He said: "I personally, and the six representatives of the All-India Trade Union Association, all feel that this visit to China has yielded many gains. Among us, we have heard some rumors about China in the past; and after arriving in China, the achievements and victories of the New China in various aspects have surprised us. I especially want to mention that in Chinese cities, there are no beggars, no theft, and corruption has been gradually eliminated, which is a remarkable achievement for any country and any people!"

He repeatedly said that his impression of New China is difficult to describe in words. He feels very sorry that he did not understand China, this great neighbor, well enough in the past. He said: "After I go back, I must tell the Indian people that China is a great nation!"

    访印度工会代表团米特拉
    我们访问了应邀前来我国参加“五一”劳动节观礼的全印劳工协会代表团团长、印度汽车工业及运输工人工会主席、阿萨密省种植园工人工会主席米特拉。
    米特拉参加了“五一”劳动节观礼后，感想很多。他把这些感想归纳起来说：从那么壮大的游行队伍中，我看到无论是青年人或老年人，无论是工人、农民、民族资产阶级，也无论是各少数民族，他们都流露着自发的热情，表现出严明的组织性和纪律性，这都充分反映了全中国人民的团结。在这伟大的场面中，我更亲眼看见广大中国人民对于他们伟大领袖毛泽东主席的爱戴和尊敬，这是深使我感动的。
    在来北京的沿途以及到达北京以后，他们已经看见许多新事物。他叙述他的印象说：“首先，我看到了中国男女的真正平等。中国妇女们已到各个岗位上参加了工作。其次是新中国对儿童教育的关心，到处都可以看到有关儿童教育的设施。比如我们在公园里就在几处看到这方面的设备。中国农村土地的充分使用，在每一寸土地上都生长着农作物，虽然中国的农业还未机械化。另外劳动者到处受人尊敬等情形，也给了我以深刻的印象。”
    访问了人民大学以后，他感到人民大学的组织和教学制度都很突出，它是按照政府工业建设的需要，有计划地培养各方面的青年干部的场所，这对于他也是新鲜事物之一。
    米特拉谈到印度人民保卫世界和平的运动。他说，印度人民的和平运动，虽然还不是完全有组织的运动，但是如果在任何一个地方发生了战争，印度人民尤其是工人一定会起来加以阻止的。因为，印度人民都热烈地、迫切地要求和平，要求保持国内的和平，要求保持国际间的和平。他说：“我也体会到，中国人民保卫和平的愿望是非常热烈的，因为中国人民已深深认识到这一点：要建设新中国，就要有和平的环境。在‘五一’游行时，我清楚地看到了中国人民对和平的这种愿望。”
    中、印两大民族是有着传统的友谊的。米特拉以极大的兴趣谈及今后如何更加增进两国人民的友谊的问题。他希望今后两国人民能经常派遣代表团，交流文化，使彼此获得更深入的了解。他说，在印度波儿普地方的一个大学里，就设有专系，教授中国文字语言，学习和介绍中国的文学和艺术作品。他希望中国大学校里也增添教授印度文的教授，这样可以促进和发展相互间的友谊。说到这里，他又谈到这次来中国的收获。他说：“我个人，以及全印劳工协会的六个代表，都同样感到这次访问中国得到很多收获。在我们这些人中间，过去曾听到一些说中国不好的传言；而到中国后，新中国在各方面所获得的成绩和胜利，都使我们感到惊奇。我特别要提到，在中国的城市里，已没有乞丐，没有盗窃，贪污腐化现象也已逐步肃清，这无论对那一个国家、那一国人民来说，都是了不起的成绩！”
    他再三重复说对新中国的印象是难以用语言形容的。他觉得很遗憾，在过去长久的期间，对中国这个伟大的邻邦了解得很不够。他说：“回去以后，我一定要告诉印度人民说：中国是一个伟大的民族！”
