Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th — More than 120 members of the World Federation of Trade Unions and various national trade union representatives who were invited to China to attend the May Day celebrations left Nanjing by train on the morning of the 14th. During their two-day visit to Nanjing, the representatives paid respects at the Yuhuatai Martyrs' Cemetery, visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, and toured the Workers' Cultural Palace, Workers' Hospital, Industrial Production Exhibition, Land Reform Exhibition, and the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They also visited scenic spots such as Linggu Temple. On the evening of the 13th, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly hosted a banquet for all the representatives and held a dance party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th — The head of the British Workers' Delegation, Hayward, who was invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations, wrote a letter to the coal miners of Northeast China on the 10th when he left Shenyang, thanking the Chinese workers for their warm reception during their visit to Fushun and the gifts presented by the miners—exquisite amber (an artwork refined from coal essence), a local specialty.
    Hayward wrote: "On behalf of the British delegation, I express my gratitude to you. We appreciate the gifts we received during our visit to Fushun and feel very happy and honored. We will cherish them for life. We will never forget this historic day and everyone's care for us."
    Hayward continued: "Here, I also extend my sincere thanks to all the people and children who warmly welcomed us. We truly enjoyed every minute and were reluctant to leave. After we return to England, we must do everything in our power to break down the barriers between our two countries and strengthen the struggle for friendship and world peace."
