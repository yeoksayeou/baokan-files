Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 25th – Because Dodd and Colson exposed the crimes of the American aggressors in persecuting our captured personnel on Geoje Island, causing the American government, which is full of "humanitarianism," to "lose face" greatly, U.S. Secretary of the Army Pace announced on the 23rd that they would both be demoted to colonels. Dodd, who personally carried out the bloody massacres and forced screening of our captured personnel, certainly knew that the crimes Colson admitted were far less significant than all the crimes committed by the U.S. on Geoje Island. In his statement on the 12th, he admitted: "The demands made by the prisoners of war are of minor importance, and the concessions promised by the prisoner of war camp authorities are also insignificant." Nevertheless, the American aggressors, who were extremely embarrassed by the scandal in front of the people of the world, had to demote these two generals who were acting on Washington's orders in order to cover up their predicament. Dodd and Colson were clearly dissatisfied with Washington for using them as scapegoats. According to an Associated Press report from Seoul on the 24th, the demoted Dodd said: "People in Washington apparently think they have done the right thing, so anything I say now is useless." Regarding this point, even officers in the American invading army felt indignant on their behalf. An Associated Press report from Uijeongbu, Korea, on the 23rd, revealed that some colleagues of Colson in the U.S. Army's 1st Corps felt that Colson had become a "scapegoat."

The American aggressors, fearing that Dodd and Colson would reveal more of the truth about Geoje Island, have not allowed reporters to interview them or allow them to make statements. This has not only caused American news agency reporters to complain, but also caused deep dissatisfaction among officers in the American invading army in Korea. The aforementioned Associated Press dispatch on the 23rd revealed that many officers said: They had suggested giving Colson an opportunity to talk about the events surrounding the Dodd incident, "but the orders of the Department of the Army made them powerless."

    暴露美国在巨济岛罪行的两将官
    已被美国陆军部贬职
    美方妄图借此掩饰其狼狈的丑态
    【新华社开城二十五日电】由于杜德和柯尔生暴露了美国侵略者在巨济岛上迫害我方被俘人员的罪行，使满口“人道主义”的美国政府大为“丢脸”，美国陆军部长佩斯已于二十三日宣布将他们两人降为上校。曾经亲手执行了对我方被俘人员的血腥屠杀与强迫甄别的杜德，当然知道柯尔生所供认的罪行，比起美方在巨济岛上所犯的全部罪行来，是太不足道了。他在十二日发表声明时就供认：“战俘们所提出的要求是关系不大的，俘虏营当局所答应的让步也是很不重要的。”尽管如此，在全世界人民面前出了丑的处境十分狼狈的美国侵略者，却不能不把这两个按照华盛顿命令办事的将官贬职，以掩饰自己的窘态。杜德和柯尔生显然对华盛顿把他们当做替死鬼表示不满。据美联社汉城二十四日电透露，被降了职的杜德说：“华盛顿方面的人显然认为他们做得很对，所以我现在说什么也是等于白说。”关于这一点，连美国侵略军中的军官们都替他们感觉不平。美联社朝鲜议政府二十三日电透露，美军第一兵团的柯尔生某些同僚觉得柯尔生成了“受罪羊”。
    美国侵略者害怕杜德和柯尔生泄露更多的巨济岛上的真相，一直不许记者向他们进行访问，也不许他们发表谈话。这不但使美国通讯社的记者啧有烦言，美国侵朝军中的军官也深感不满。上述美联社二十三日的电讯透露，许多军官说：他们曾建议让柯尔生有机会谈一谈关于杜德事件的经过情形，“但陆军部的命令使他们无能为力”。
