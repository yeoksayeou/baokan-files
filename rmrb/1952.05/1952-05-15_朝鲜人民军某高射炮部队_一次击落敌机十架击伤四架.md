Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 14th. A certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of the Korean People's Army, stationed in a frontline area, shot down and damaged a total of fourteen enemy aircraft during an aerial battle on April 20th. On that morning, twenty enemy planes flew over the unit's location, attempting to disrupt our army's transportation lines in the area. The anti-aircraft gunners immediately launched a fierce anti-aircraft bombardment, shooting down seven enemy planes on the spot. The remaining enemy planes attempted to retaliate with frantic bombing and strafing. The anti-aircraft gunners continued to engage in a fierce battle with the enemy planes. The aiming and firing personnel of one anti-aircraft gun were knocked down by the blast wave from an exploding bomb, but they quickly got up and continued firing, shooting down three more enemy planes in succession. Labor Party member Li Honglu was wounded in the head by shrapnel, but he persisted in the fight and, along with other anti-aircraft gunners, damaged four enemy planes. The remaining American aerial bandits fled in panic, and the attempt to attack our transportation lines was completely thwarted.

    朝鲜人民军某高射炮部队
    一次击落敌机十架击伤四架
    【新华社平壤十四日电】在前线某地的一个朝鲜人民军高射炮部队，在四月二十日的对空作战中，共击落击伤敌机十四架。是日清晨，敌机二十架飞到该部队驻地上空，企图破坏这个地区我军的运输线。高射炮手们当即展开猛烈的对空轰击，当场击落七架敌机。其余的敌机企图报复，进行疯狂的轰炸扫射。高射炮手们继续与敌机展开激烈战斗。有一门高射炮的瞄准手和炮手被炸弹爆裂时的气浪震倒，但他们很快地爬起来继续射击，一连击落了三架敌机。劳动党员李弘錄头部被弹片打伤，但他坚持战斗，和其他高射炮手一道击伤了四架敌机。其余的美国空中强盗仓惶逃跑，空袭我运输线的企图被完全粉碎。
