    Li Xikui, Creator of the Li Xikui Shunting Method,
    Requests Newspaper Coverage of the Promotion of the Advanced Shunting Method on National Railways
    To the Editor: I urgently want to know about the promotion of my shunting method on railways nationwide. I want to know what difficulties have been encountered in the promotion process, what good experiences have been created, and what achievements have been made. Starting on the 21st, I will be going with comrades from the Rolling Stock Bureau of the Ministry of Railways to railways in the South and North to understand the situation and problems in promoting my shunting method. I will be on-site to help shunting crews master this shunting method, and I will also report the recent experience of the China Changchun Railway in promoting my shunting method to the shunting crews.
    I once investigated the promotion of my shunting method by each shunting crew on the China Changchun Railway with Liu Shide, Chief Engineer of the Rolling Stock Department of the China Changchun Railway Administration, and others. Every shunting crew on the China Changchun Railway has implemented my shunting method and has achieved great results. Seventy-eight shunting crews received qualification certificates for "Implementing the Li Xikui Shunting Method." Because of implementing my shunting method, the average dismantling time has reached twelve minutes, and the average marshalling time has reached thirteen minutes. Our shunting crew recently achieved new victories, with dismantling time reaching eight minutes and marshalling time reaching thirteen minutes. I believe that only when everyone promotes advanced experience can advanced experience be enriched.
    　Industrial Labor Model Li Xikui
    Editor's Note: Li Xikui, the creator of the Li Xikui shunting method, has made a very good request to this newspaper. We are further strengthening our ties with advanced workers across the country and are preparing to publish various advanced experiences and the situation and difficulties in promoting advanced experiences in a more systematic way, so as to solve the various problems encountered by various places in promoting advanced experiences, in order to serve the promotion of advanced experiences. We will strive to quickly realize the request made by Labor Model Li Xikui.

    李锡奎调车法的创造人李锡奎
    要求报纸报道先进调车法在全国铁路上推广的情况
    编辑同志：我迫切希望知道全国铁路推广我的调车法的情况。在推广过程中，各地碰到那些困难，创造了那些好的经验，有了一些什么成绩，我都想知道。从二十一日起，我将要和铁道部车务局同志到南方、北方各铁路，了解推广我的调车法的情况和问题，我将要在现场帮助各调车组工友掌握这个调车法，我还要把中长铁路最近推广我的调车法的经验报告给各调车组工友。
    我曾经和中长铁路管理局车务处总工程师刘世德等调查了中长铁路每个调车组推广我的调车法的情况。中长铁路每个调车组都已经实行了我的调车法，有了很大的成绩。七十八个调车组得到了“贯彻李锡奎调车法”的合格证。因为实行我的调车法，解体时间平均已达到十二分钟，编组时间平均已达到十三分钟。我们的调车组最近又获得了新的胜利，解体时间达到八分钟，编组时间达到十三分钟。我相信：只有大家都推广先进经验，才能使先进经验更加丰富。
   　工业劳动模范  李锡奎
    编者按：李锡奎调车法创造人李锡奎向本报提出的要求是很好的。我们正与各地先进工作者进一步密切联系，准备较系统地刊登各种先进经验及推广先进经验的情况和困难，解决各地在推广先进经验时所遇到的各种问题，以便为推广先进经验服务。劳动模范李锡奎所提出的要求，我们要努力使它很快实现。
