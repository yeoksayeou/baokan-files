    Visiting Czechoslovak Labor Model Socholik

    František Socholik, a member of the Czechoslovak Trade Union Delegation invited to China to attend the May Day celebrations, is a veteran steelworker and now a foreman at the Vítkovice "Gottwald" Metallurgical Combine in Czechoslovakia—the new state-owned steel plant in Ostrava City.

    Socholik said that although he had never been to China, he knew that the Chinese people had waged a heroic war of resistance against Japan and a revolutionary war for liberation, and had achieved a great victory. This victory is the greatest victory for the world proletariat since the October Revolution. Therefore, he told the reporter, "When I heard that the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions was going to send the first delegation to the distant New China to participate in May Day, and I was selected as one of the representatives, I was very happy and pleased."

    In the two or three days since arriving in China, Socholik has visited the Palace Museum and some schools, parks, etc. His impression of New China is beautiful, China has a long history, and the Chinese people are diligent and intelligent. He visited the Beihai Beijing Experimental Nursery and saw the children of the nursery living happily and contentedly. He thought: New China cares very much for children, and the parents of these children can participate in the construction of the motherland without any worries.

    When talking about his contribution to the construction of his motherland, Socholik told the reporter about his own experiences and work situation.

    Socholik was born on January 23, 1901, in a working-class family with nine children in the Bílovec district of Kyjovice City. From the age of fourteen, he worked as an agricultural worker. At the age of seventeen, he entered the Vítkovice Metallurgical Combine as a worker, first as an ordinary worker, and later as a steelworker. Before liberation, he personally experienced the poverty and suffering of unemployment. During the overall crisis of the capitalist economy before World War II, Socholik often couldn't find work, and on average, he could only work one week a month, and the wages he received were not enough to maintain his family life. He had organized many strikes to fight against the capitalists. During the years of Hitler's German rule over Czechoslovakia, Socholik was captured and forced to work as a laborer, and he resisted the German invaders by slowing down work. After liberation, there was no longer the threat of unemployment. His monthly salary was 3,500 crowns (now his monthly salary is 10,000 crowns), and his life began to improve. He felt deeply that he had become the master of the country, and that doing a good job was for the entire working class and for building a socialist Czechoslovakia. Therefore, he was particularly active in his work.

    In May 1945, Socholik joined the Communist Party and immediately participated in the work of shortening steelmaking time.

    Due to years of steelmaking experience, Socholik knows deeply the important role of improving labor organization and improving workers' technical level in improving production.

    Socholik works on the Dahlbert furnace, which is a mobile furnace with a steel outlet on one side and two slag outlets on the other. Each smelting can produce 300 tons of steel. Four years ago, this type of furnace required four official workers to watch over it, the work was not fixed, and each smelting took no less than ten hours, generally eleven to twelve hours. After Socholik's research, the work of each worker and the specific operating positions were fixed, which not only reduced one worker watching over the furnace, but also shortened the smelting time and reduced waste. Now, each smelting only takes eight or nine hours.

    In order to improve the skills of other workers, Socholik is very enthusiastic to teach everyone his many years of work experience. He tells other workers how to work according to the production schedule, how to work in an orderly manner, how to look at the color of the steel fire, how to reduce waste, and so on. Socholik is not only a labor hero, but also an enthusiastic trade union worker. He has served as a trade union group leader, and is now a member of the factory trade union committee and chairman of the socialist competition work committee. Through the trade union, he unites many workers, carries out socialist competition, creates more wealth for the country, and strives to build a socialist Czechoslovakia. He said: We trade union workers should let every worker understand that only unity and cooperation can we overfulfill the glorious tasks assigned to us by the state.

    According to Socholik himself, he is now very interested in the work of the Socialist Competition Committee. Because this committee mainly studies how to improve the factory's labor productivity, how to improve the quantity and quality of steel production, and how to encourage all groups of workers to participate in the competition. The members of their workshop's Socialist Competition Committee are all elected by the workers' congress. They are all workers' activists and excellent engineering and technical personnel. They can unite all the workers, carry out the competition, and use their own exemplary role to mobilize all the workers to participate in the competition. Recently, according to the decisions of the Party and the government, he has led all the workers in the workshop to launch a friendly challenge to the steelworkers of other metallurgical factories: striving to complete the highest amount of production plan and accurately complete the production progress indicators.

    访捷克斯洛伐克劳动模范索霍力克
    弗朗悌歇克·索霍力克是这次应邀来我国参加“五一”节观礼的捷克斯洛伐克工会代表团的团员，他是一位炼钢老工人，现在是捷克斯洛伐克维特考维茨克“哥特瓦尔德”冶金联合工厂——俄斯特拉发城新的国营炼钢工厂——的领班。
    索霍力克说他过去虽然没来到过中国，但是他知道中国人民进行过英勇的抗日战争和争取解放的革命战争，而且获得了伟大的胜利。这胜利是全世界无产阶级继十月革命以后的最大胜利。所以，他对记者说：“当我听到捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会要派遣第一个代表团到达遥远的新中国参加‘五一’节，而且我被派作其中的一个代表时，我内心是非常愉快和高兴的。”
    来中国两三天内，索霍力克参观了故宫博物院和一些学校、公园等。他对新中国的印象是美丽的，中国的历史是悠久的，中国人民是勤劳的、智慧的。他参观了北海北京实验托儿所，亲眼看到了托儿所的孩子们愉快、幸福的生活，他就想：新中国对孩子们是十分关怀的，这些孩子们的父母可以无牵无虑地参加祖国建设工作。
    谈到他对自己祖国建设的贡献时，索霍力克对记者讲述了他自己的经历和工作情形。
    索霍力克于一九零一年一月二十三日生于基也维次城比洛维茨区的一个九个孩子的工人家庭中。从十四岁起，他就做农业工人，十七岁那年，进入维特考维茨克冶金联合工厂做工，最初当普通工人，后来成为炼钢工人。解放以前，他亲身尝试过失业的穷困的苦楚。在第二次世界大战前资本主义经济总危机中，索霍力克常找不到工作做，平均每月只能工作一星期，得到的工资不够维持家庭生活。他曾组织过多次罢工，对资本家进行斗争。在希特勒德国统治捷克斯洛伐克的年月里，索霍力克被抓去做劳工，他便以怠工来对抗德国侵略者。解放以后，再也没有失业的威胁了，他每月工资有三千五百克朗（现在他每月工资是一万克朗），他的生活开始好起来。他切身感到自己成了国家的主人，感到做好工作就是为了全体工人阶级，为了建设社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克，所以，他在工作上表现得特别的积极。
    一九四五年五月，索霍力克参加了共产党，并立即参加了争取缩短炼钢时间的工作。
    由于多年的炼钢的经验，索霍力克深知改进劳动组织和提高工人的技术水平对提高生产的重大作用。
    索霍力克是在达尔报特熔炉工作，这是一种可以活动的熔炉，一面有出钢孔，另一面有两孔出矿渣，每一次熔炼可以出钢三百吨。四年以前，这种熔炉要有四个正式工人看管，工作不固定，每一次熔炼不少于十小时，一般需十一至十二小时。经索霍力克研究，固定了每个工人的工作和一定的操作位置，不但减少了一个看管熔炉的工人，而且缩短了熔炼时间，减少了浪费。现在，他们每次熔炼只需八、九小时。
    为了提高其他工人的技术，索霍力克很热心把自己多年来工作的经验教给大家。他告诉别的工人如何按照生产进度表进行工作，如何工作的有次序，如何看钢的火色，如何减少浪费等等。索霍力克不但是一个劳动英雄，而且是一个热心的工会工作者。他担任过工会小组长，现在是工厂工会委员会的委员兼社会主义竞赛工作委员会的主席。他通过工会，团结了很多的工人，开展社会主义竞赛，给国家创造更多的财富，为建设社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克而奋斗。他说：我们工会工作者应让每个工人懂得：只有团结和合作，才能超额完成国家给予我们的光荣任务。
    据索霍力克自己说：他现在对搞社会主义竞赛委员会的工作，十分感到有兴趣。因为这个委员会主要是研究怎样提高工厂劳动生产率，怎样提高出钢的数量和质量，怎样使各组工人参加竞赛。他们车间社会主义竞赛委员会的委员，都是由工人大会选举出来的，他们都是工人活动分子和优秀的工程技术人员，他们能够团结全体工人，开展竞赛；并以自己的示范作用，发动全体工人参加竞赛。最近，他根据党和政府的决议，带动全车间工人，已向其他冶金工厂的炼钢工人提出友谊的挑战：争取完成最高量的生产计划和精确地完成生产进度指标。
