    Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Recently, the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to open in Beijing. As early as March 21st, eleven well-known figures in China dedicated to the cause of peace, including Song Qingling and Guo Moruo, jointly issued an appeal, inviting peace-loving and just individuals from Asian, Australian, and Pacific Rim countries to jointly initiate the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference." This peace appeal, representing the will of our entire nation, immediately received enthusiastic responses from peace-loving individuals in Asian, Australian, and Pacific Rim countries. From the Soviet Union in Northwest Asia to Chile on the Southeast Pacific coast, from India and Burma in Southeast Asia to Canada in North America, from Japan to Australia, including peace figures from twenty countries such as Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Laos, Pakistan, Ceylon, Indonesia, the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, unanimously expressed their support for holding the peace conference in Beijing. Some have appointed initiators and established preparatory committees in their own countries to participate in the conference; others have appointed representatives to come to China to participate in the preparatory meeting, actively carrying out the various preparatory works for the peace conference.
    Why are people from various countries so enthusiastic about holding the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference"? This is because people are increasingly aware of a fact: that is, in order to dominate the world and enslave all the people of the world, American imperialism is plotting to expand its war of aggression, clamoring for war preparations everywhere, establishing military bases, and attempting to push all the people of the world into the abyss of another world war. In Asia, American imperialism has already carried out direct armed aggression against Korea and our country's Taiwan. After suffering a serious defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, it still shows no remorse and is still using various methods to sabotage and delay the Korean armistice negotiations. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, disregarding all international conventions and human morality, and conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. In order to turn Japan into its colony and an important military base for its aggression against the people of Asia, American imperialism has brazenly disregarded the resolute opposition of major Asian countries (also major countries in the war against Japan) such as China, the Soviet Union, India, and Burma, and single-handedly signed a one-sided "peace treaty with Japan" and an illegal "US-Japan Administrative" agreement, more brazenly instigating the reactionary Japanese government to intensify the restoration of the Japanese aggressive army in the name of expanding the "police reserve force," and rearming Japan.
    In other countries in the Asian and Pacific region, American imperialism is also using various methods of threats and enticements, attempting to drag them onto the path of adventurous war preparations. The internal affairs of these countries have been subjected to brutal interference, and their foreign trade has been greatly restricted, resulting in a sharp drop in the prices of exported goods and a significant reduction in quantity. Take Malaya as an example: after the implementation of the rubber "embargo" in May 1951, the price of rubber in Singapore fell by 30% compared to February. According to official US figures, Malaya's rubber exports in January of this year decreased by 21,000 tons compared to December of last year. The fall in rubber prices will also cause Indonesia's rubber export losses to reach more than 800 million guilders per year (currently, one guilder is approximately equal to 1,200 yuan RMB). Due to the reduction in exports, production in these countries has been reduced, unemployment has increased, and the living standards of the people have further declined.
    But on the other hand, the broad masses of people in Asian and Pacific countries strongly demand peace. On the declaration calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact, 344 million people in China alone have signed. The Chinese People's Volunteers have stepped onto the forefront of the struggle to defend peace in Asia, assisting the Korean people and repelling the armed aggression of American imperialism in Korea. The Japanese people, under the crazy suppression of the US-Japanese reactionaries, are waging an unyielding struggle to oppose the American occupation and strive for national independence and peace, and the scale of the struggle is growing. On May 1st, the Japanese working people, disregarding the crazy suppression of the US-Japanese reactionaries, bravely celebrated their festival in more than 480 places across the country (with more than three million people). This is another powerful demonstration by the Japanese working people against the US-Japanese reactionaries after the general strike on April 18th. This demonstration demonstrates the unwavering determination of the Japanese working people to oppose war, oppose rearmament, and defend peace, freedom, and independence. The people of countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, Canada, and Australia have held national peace conferences more than once. Peace committees have been established in many large cities, and committees have been established in various regions. The influence of peace fighters among the people is growing, and the number of peace signatures is increasing. The peace forces are also growing vigorously in Chile, Panama, Guatemala, and other Latin American countries on the Pacific coast, which are under the strict control of American imperialism. Latin American and American peace fighters overcame various obstacles and sabotage, and finally held the Latin American Peace Congress in March of this year. More than ten million people in Latin American countries have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact. They combine their efforts to strive for the conclusion of a peace pact with their efforts to oppose the aggressive policies of American imperialism. They protest against the recruitment of soldiers in Latin American countries and oppose sending troops to Korea. Under popular pressure, the Guatemalan government was forced to announce that it would not send troops overseas; the Argentine government was also forced to make the same statement; in Cuba, the peace movement forced the Congress to stop discussing the bill on sending troops to Korea. Many facts prove a truth: as long as the masses of the people can actively rise up to carry out the struggle to defend peace, war can be avoided.
    Under the current situation, holding a peace conference in the Asian and Pacific region, gathering peace-loving people from various countries and various fields together, exchanging opinions extensively on various issues of defending peace, and seeking appropriate measures to solve these problems, is of great significance. This peace conference will be the beginning of cultural exchanges between Asian and Pacific Rim countries; it will be the beginning of breaking down artificial economic barriers and establishing trade relations; it will greatly encourage and promote the peace movement in this region to a new climax, giving a heavy blow to American imperialism's war policy of dominating the world.

### 迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议

    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    最近，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议要在北京开幕了。早在三月二十一日，我国努力于和平事业的著名人士宋庆龄、郭沫若等十一人，曾联名发出发起书，邀请亚洲、澳洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平与正义的人士，共同发起“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”，这个代表着我们全国人民意志的和平呼吁，立刻获得亚洲、澳洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平人士的热烈响应。从亚洲西北部的苏联到太平洋东南岸的智利，从东南亚的印度、缅甸到北美洲的加拿大，从日本到澳大利亚，包括朝鲜、越南、蒙古、寮国、巴基斯坦、锡兰、印度尼西亚、美国、墨西哥、哥伦比亚、危地马拉、萨尔瓦多、尼加拉瓜等二十个国家的和平人士，一致表示拥护在北京召开和平会议。他们有的推定了发起人，成立了本国参加会议的筹备委员会；或者推定了来中国参加筹备会议的代表，积极进行着和平会议的各项筹备工作。
    为什么各国人民对举行“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”这样热心呢？这是因为人们越来越清楚地看到一个事实，这就是美国帝国主义为了独霸世界，奴役全世界人民，正在阴谋扩大侵略战争，到处叫嚣备战，建立军事基地，企图把全世界人民推到另一次世界大战的深渊里去。在亚洲，美帝国主义已对朝鲜和我国的台湾进行了直接的武装侵略。在侵朝战争中遭受严重挫败以后，至今没有丝毫悔祸之心，现在仍在用各种方法破坏和拖延朝鲜停战谈判。最近更变本加厉，不顾一切国际公约的约束和人类的道德，在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战。为了把日本变成它的殖民地，变成它侵略亚洲人民的重要军事基地，美帝国主义悍然不顾中国、苏联、印度、缅甸等亚洲主要国家（也是对日作战主要国家）的坚决反对，一手包办签订了片面的“对日和约”和非法的“美日行政”协定，更加放肆地唆使日本反动政府以扩张“警察后备队”为名，加紧恢复日本的侵略军队，重新武装日本。
    在亚洲及太平洋区域的其他国家，美帝国主义也在用各种威胁利诱的方法，企图把他们拖上冒险备战的道路。这些国家的内政遭到横暴的干涉，对外贸易受到很大的限制，致使出口物资价格猛跌，数量大大减少。以马来亚为例：一九五一年五月实行橡胶“禁运”后，星加坡橡胶价格较二月份下跌百分之三十。据美国官方公布：马来亚今年一月的橡胶输出比去年十二月减少了二万一千吨。橡胶价格的下跌，也将使印尼橡胶出口的损失每年达到八亿多盾（目前一盾约合人民币一千二百余元）。由于出口减少，这些国家生产缩减，失业增加，人民生活水平更加降低了。
    但另一方面，亚洲及太平洋各国的广大人民却强烈地要求和平。在要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上，仅我国即有三亿四千四百万人签名。我国人民志愿军走上保卫亚洲和平斗争的最前线，援助朝鲜人民，击退了美帝国主义在朝鲜的武装侵略。在美日反动派疯狂镇压下的日本人民，为反对美国的占领，争取民族的独立与和平，正进行着不屈不挠的斗争，斗争的规模越来越大。五月一日，日本劳动人民又不顾美日反动派的疯狂镇压，在全国四百八十多处地方（有三百万以上的人民），勇敢地庆祝自己的节日。这是日本劳动人民在四月十八日总罢工之后向美日反动派的又一次有力的示威。这次示威表现出日本劳动人民反对战争，反对重新武装与保卫和平、自由与独立的不可动摇的决心。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、加拿大、澳大利亚等国家的人民，不止一次地召开了全国性的和平会议。许多大城镇都成立了和平委员会，各地区设立了委员会。和平战士在人民群众中的影响日益增大，和平签名的人数日益增多。美帝国主义严密控制下的太平洋沿岸的智利、巴拿马、危地马拉及其他拉丁美洲国家，和平力量也在蓬勃生长。拉丁美洲和美国的和平战士克服了种种阻挠和破坏，终于在今年三月间举行了拉丁美洲的和平大会。拉丁美洲各国的人民在要求缔结五大国和平公约宣言上签名的，已达一千万人以上。他们并把争取缔结和平公约的努力与反对美帝国主义侵略政策的努力结合起来。他们抗议在拉丁美洲国家内招募士兵，反对派遣军队到朝鲜去。危地马拉政府在人民压力下，被迫宣布不派遣军队到海外去；阿根廷政府也被迫作了同样的声明；在古巴，和平运动使国会不得不停止关于派兵去朝鲜的议案的讨论。许多事实证明一个真理：只要人民群众能积极地起来进行保卫和平的斗争，战争是可以避免的。
    在目前这种情势下召开亚洲及太平洋区域的和平会议，各国及各个方面的爱好和平人士聚集在一起，对保卫和平的各项问题广泛地交换意见，并寻求解决这些问题的适当措施，是有着重大意义的。这一和平会议，将成为亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国文化交流的开端；将成为打破人为的经济障碍、建立贸易关系的开端；将大大鼓舞和推动这个区域的和平运动走向新的高潮，给美帝国主义独霸世界的战争政策以沉重的打击。（附图片）
