Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau Drilling Team Creates New Record of 23 Meters Per Day Drilling Shale
    The Jiao Zuo Mining Bureau Drilling Team, by improving labor organization and operational methods, created a new record of drilling 23 meters per day in sandy shale. In the past, the labor organization of this drilling team had problems, and the cyclical operation system was not conscientiously implemented. For example, when it was almost time for shift change, they would not lower the drill; they would shut down the machinery before the next shift arrived; they would not repair broken drills; and they would not clearly explain the drilling situation to the next shift. As a result, confusion and waste occurred in the work. During the "Three-Anti" movement, the drilling team members received profound class education and conducted criticism and self-criticism regarding the past irresponsibility of some personnel towards state property and shortcomings such as localism and lack of unity. A system of specific responsibility for specific personnel was implemented. The team leader was responsible for the safe operation of the machine, and the deputy driver was responsible for security work. The four drillers also had clearly defined divisions of labor, overcoming the past confusion. After implementing the system of specific responsibility for specific personnel, the shift change system was also strictly enforced. The previous shift not only clearly explained the tools and production situation to the next shift but also prepared the drill bit for the next shift. When the drill bit had a problem, they would not leave it for the next shift to repair. They overcame localism and ensured that the drilling never stopped even when people were resting. In the past, technicians had conservative ideas and were unwilling to teach the technology to new workers. When problems occurred during drilling, only the technician would repair it, and the other workers would wait around with nothing to do. Recently, the technicians participated in study sessions and realized that conservative ideas were not the ideas of the working class, and they guaranteed to correct them in practical actions. Once, when a problem occurred in the borehole, the technician immediately told everyone the cause of the problem. In this way, everyone worked together to repair broken tools, shortening downtime. At the same time, the technical level of the workers was improved, creating conditions for preventing failures. With these improvements, everyone's enthusiasm for production increased. In the past, it took seven days to move a drilling rig; this time, the Wang Mingshan team moved the drilling rig in only four days. In the past, there was no plan for moving the drilling rig, and everyone would crowd around to work, with some people having no place to insert their hands and only watching from the side, causing wasted labor. This time, when moving the drilling rig, Wang Mingshan first discussed it with the masses, and everyone clearly divided the labor and cooperated with each other, so the task was successfully completed.
    In the past, when the drilling team removed casings from the borehole, they used a single screw head, which was very inefficient, taking eight hours to remove fifty casings. Worker Wang Zikui thought to himself that if they changed to using two screw heads in a cycle, the efficiency would definitely improve. The test results showed that it only took five hours to remove fifty casings. This sped up the drilling progress and created a new record of drilling 23 meters per day in sandy shale.

    焦作矿务局钻探工程队  
    创造钻砂页岩日进二十三公尺的新纪录
    焦作矿务局钻探工程队改进了劳动组织和操作方法，创造了钻砂页岩日进二十三公尺的新纪录。在过去，这个钻探工程队的劳动组织有毛病，没有认真执行循环作业制度。比如，快到交接班的时间，该下钻的也不下钻了；下一班还没有来接班就关车了；钻坏了也不修理；钻探情况也不向下班交代清楚。因此，在工作中造成了混乱和浪费现象。在“三反”运动中，钻探工程队员受到了深刻的阶级教育，对于某些人员过去对国家财产不负责任和本位主义、互不团结等毛病进行了批评和自我批评，实行了专人专责制。班长负责机器安全运转，副开车的负责保安工作；四个钻工也都明确地分了工，克服了过去的混乱现象。实行专人专责制后，交接班制度执行得也严格了。上一班不但把工具和生产情况向下一班交代清楚，并且要给下一班作好钻头；钻头有故障时，也不留给下一班来修理了。他们克服了本位主义，做到了人停钻不停。技术员中过去有保守思想，不肯把技术教给新工人，在打钻出毛病时，只是技术员一个人修理，别的工人都等着没事做。最近，技术员参加了学习，认识到保守思想不是工人阶级思想，保证在实际行动中改正。有一次钻孔出了毛病，技术员马上把出毛病的原因告诉大家。这样，工具坏了大家动手修，缩短了停工时间；同时，工人技术水平提高了，为防止故障创造了条件。有了这些改进后，大家生产劲头更大了。在过去迁移钻探机要费七天时间；这次王明善班迁移钻探机只用了四天的时间。过去，迁移钻探机没有订计划，干起活来大家一齐围上去，有的人没地方插手，只有在旁边看，造成了窝工现象。这次迁移钻探机时，王明善先和群众讨论，大家明确地分了工，团结互助，任务便胜利地完成了。
    钻探工程队过去从钻孔中取套管时，用一个螺丝头取，效率很低，取五十根套管就要费八小时。工人王子魁心里一琢磨，如果改成两个螺丝头循环取，效率一定能提高。试验结果，取五十根套管只费了五个钟头。这样，就加快了打钻的进度，创造了在砂页岩上钻探日进二十三公尺的新纪录。
