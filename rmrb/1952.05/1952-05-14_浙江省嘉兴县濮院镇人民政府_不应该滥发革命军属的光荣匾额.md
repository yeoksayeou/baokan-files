To the Editor:

My name is Huang Jianlie. I used to be a ticket seller at the Beijing Public Transportation Company and am now studying in the Accounting Class of the Second Department of Beijing Finance and Economics School.

In early March, my sister-in-law came to Beijing from my hometown. She said that my family has hung up plaques and framed certificates that say "Family of Honor" and "Family Member of Huang Jianlie." The reason my family received these glorious titles is that the People's Government of Puyuan Town, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, mistakenly regarded me as a revolutionary soldier. She also said that my father (Huang Wenzhao, village chief of Wanquan Village, Puyuan Town, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province) attended symposiums at the Tangpu Township Puyuan Town People's Government many times to accept this glorious military family plaque and fabricated "stories of the glorious soldier." It is extremely inappropriate for my family to receive the titles of "Family of Honor" and "Family Member of Huang Jianlie" because I am not a revolutionary soldier. I have written to my father several times, asking him to immediately ask the local People's Government to take back this glorious title. However, I have not yet received a reply. In order to be responsible to the people and to prevent the solemn title of glorious military family from being abused, I request that the relevant departments immediately investigate this matter.

### 浙江省嘉兴县濮院镇人民政府  不应该滥发革命军属的光荣匾额

    浙江省嘉兴县濮院镇人民政府
    不应该滥发革命军属的光荣匾额
    编辑同志：我叫黄建烈，我原在北京市公共汽车公司当售票员，现在北京市财经学校二部会计班学习。
    三月初，我嫂嫂从家乡来北京。她说我家里挂有“光荣之家”和“黄建烈家属”的匾额、镜框各一块。我家得到这些光荣称号的原因，是浙江省嘉兴县濮院镇人民政府错把我当成革命军人了。她并且说，我父亲（黄文照，浙江省嘉兴县濮院镇万全村村长）为接受这光荣军属匾，曾经到塘濮乡濮院镇人民政府参加座谈会多次，还无中生有地介绍了“光荣军人的事迹”。我家得到“光荣之家”和“黄建烈家属”的称号，是极不应该的，因为我并不是革命军人。我曾经先后写信给我父亲，要他立刻请当地人民政府收回这一光荣称号。但是，现在我还没有得到复信。为了对人民负责，为了使光荣军属的庄严称号不被滥用，我请求有关部门立即检查这件事。
    黄建烈
