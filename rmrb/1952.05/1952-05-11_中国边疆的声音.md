The Voice of China's Borderlands
Deputy Head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Kim Chaokui

    In Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, one evening when the sunset glowed over the valley, Comrade Zhao Shengzhe and I visited a Naxi peasant woman, Mu Hongxian.
    The room was full of farm tools, but it did not appear cluttered. A tall candle burned brightly on the table, its light shining on her red, very honest, and robust face. She spoke to us in a low voice. Her words were like a poem cursing the darkness of the past and praising the light of today. She said:
    "During the Kuomintang rule, we minority nationalities lived inhuman lives like cattle and horses all day long. We couldn't get enough to eat, couldn't keep warm, running around, being beaten and abused, and couldn't hold our heads up wherever we went. The Kuomintang provoked ethnic hatred, causing us to fight each other constantly. How many kind brothers and sisters were killed in internecine strife!
    "Even now, there is one thing I can never forget: One year, my mother fell ill, and we were too poor to call a doctor. She sighed all day long, crying out for hunger and thirst. In that situation, the hearts of us children were about to break. Besides crying together, what other way was there?
    "One day, the hooligans from the Kuomintang township government incited a Tibetan compatriot, insisting that we had damaged their feng shui, and beat the old woman severely before driving her into the deep mountains. My mother, as thin as a rake, was exposed to the sun and rain and starved to death!" She continued angrily:
    "Do the Tibetan and Naxi people have so much hatred? No! This was all created by the Kuomintang bandit gang's bloodless methods of murder! Aren't the Tibetan people suffering persecution from them just like us?
    "How many people struggled on the brink of death, how many people cried out in hunger and cold!
    "It was in these days of hardship and suffering that the People's Liberation Army came to Yunnan, came to Lijiang, came to..." At this point, her tightly knit brows relaxed, and she suddenly showed an excited and radiant light. After that, she sang to us about her new life almost in a singing tone:
    "Now! Chairman Mao's light shines on our Naxi people, and it also shines on all fraternal nationalities, shining on our hearts. Chairman Mao is our great savior! Under the leadership and inspiration of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, fraternal nationalities are united like a family, and the phenomenon of 'fighting enemies' is gone. Everyone produces, everyone labors. Life is completely different from the slave life of the Kuomintang rule.
    "We have become human beings, members of the big family of all nationalities, and masters of the new China. How happy and joyful we are, and how much we have to say to you!"
    Then she excitedly told us: "Comrades! You are the heroic Korean people. I am so happy to see you with my own eyes. To support the beloved Korean army and people, I wrote this in the patriotic pact: Open up more wasteland, produce more grain, and plan to increase production by eight hundred catties. Half of it will be donated, and half will be kept for use. I will definitely work hard to achieve my plan and support you in defeating the American imperialists as soon as possible."
    This voice symbolizes victory! This is not only Mu Hongxian's oath, but the fervent voice of support from all the working women of all nationalities in China! (Translated by Dong Diwu)

    中国边疆的声音
    朝鲜人民访华代表团副团长  金朝奎
    在云南省丽江县城内，一个晚霞辉映着山谷的傍晚，我和赵圣哲同志访问了一位摩些族的农民妇女木鸿仙。
    屋子里放满了农具，但也不显得零乱。桌上高高地燃着一支蜡烛，烛光照射在她那发红的、非常诚朴、健壮的脸上。她用低沉的声音和我们谈话。她的话像一首诅咒过去的黑暗和歌颂今日的光明的诗。她说：
    “国民党统治时期，我们少数民族整天过着非人的牛马生活。吃不饱，穿不暖，东奔西走，挨打受气，走到那里也抬不起头来。国民党挑拨民族仇恨，使我们经常互相殴斗。不知互相残杀了多少善良的兄弟姐妹们啊！
    “直到现在，还有一件最使我难忘的事：有一年妈妈病了，穷得没法请医生。成天唉声叹气，叫饥叫渴。在那种情况下，当儿女们的心快要疼裂了。除了围在一起痛哭以外，还有什么别的法子呢？
    “一天，国民党乡政府的流氓们又煽动一位藏族同胞，硬说我们冲坏了他们的风水，把老人家痛打了一顿后，又赶到深山里去。骨瘦如柴的妈妈，就这样日晒雨打，活活饿死了！”她愤怒地继续说：
    “藏族和摩些族有那么多的仇恨么？不！这都是国民党匪帮的杀人不见血的办法制造出来的！藏族还不是和我们一样受他们的迫害么？
    “多少人们挣扎在死亡线上，多少人们啼饥号寒！
    “就在这苦难重重的日月里，解放军来到了云南，来到了丽江、来到了……”说到这里，她紧锁着的双眉舒展开了，顿时呈现着兴奋焕发的光彩。此后，她几乎是用歌唱的声调，向我们歌唱着自己的新生：
    “现在啊！毛主席的光，照亮了我们摩些族，也照亮了所有的兄弟民族，照亮了我们的心。毛主席是我们的大救星！在毛主席和共产党的领导与感召下，兄弟民族团结得像一家人一样，‘打冤家’的现象没有了。人人生产，个个劳动。生活完全和国民党统治时代的奴隶生活不一样了。
    “我们变成了人，变成了各民族大家庭中的一员，变成了新中国的主人。我们是多么愉快高兴，有多少话对你们说啊？”
    接着她兴奋地告诉我们：“同志！你们是英雄的朝鲜人民。我能亲眼看到你们，真有说不出的高兴。为了支援敬爱的朝鲜军民，我在爱国公约上这样写着：多开荒地，多打粮食，计划增产八百斤。其中一半捐献，一半留用。我一定要努力实现我的计划，支援你们早日打败老美。”
    这声音象征着胜利！这不仅是木鸿仙的誓言，这是全中国各个民族所有劳动妇女们的炽热的声援之声啊！（东涤吾译）
