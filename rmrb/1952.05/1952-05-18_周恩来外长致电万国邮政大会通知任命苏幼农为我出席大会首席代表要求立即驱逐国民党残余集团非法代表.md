Xinhua News Agency, 17th:

    The Universal Postal Union convened its 13th Universal Postal Congress in Brussels, Belgium, on May 14th. All member states of the Union have the right to send representatives to participate. China is one of the member states, but the Universal Postal Union authorities, disregarding repeated protests and warnings from our government, did not invite representatives from our government to attend the meeting, and illegally admitted representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique. In response, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of China, sent a cable to the Congress on May 17th, notifying the appointment of Su Younong, Director of the Postal Administration of China, as the chief delegate to this Congress, and demanding that the Congress immediately expel the illegal "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The text of Minister Zhou's cable is as follows:
    To the Universal Postal Congress in Brussels, Belgium, and to all delegation representatives:
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing China. The Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique, a small handful already abandoned by the Chinese people in Taiwan, is absolutely not qualified to represent the great China. Any international organization or international conference that obstructs the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, or even admits the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique, is an illegal act infringing upon the legitimate rights of the Chinese people.
    China is a member of the Universal Postal Union, and the representatives of the People's Republic of China are the only legal representatives to participate in various meetings of the Union. In May 1950, representatives of the People's Republic of China participated in the Montreux Executive and Liaison Committee meeting, and in January and February 1951, participated in the joint meeting of the Executive and Liaison Committee and the International Air Transport Association held in Cairo. In December 1950, the postal authorities of the People's Republic of China also accepted the Universal Postal Convention. The legal status of the representatives of the People's Republic of China in the Universal Postal Union has long been established by the above facts.
    However, after the Cairo meeting, due to the coercion and manipulation of the US government, the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union unreasonably issued a circular soliciting opinions from member states on China's representation, and based on the minority of 33 out of 86 member states supporting the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique, made an illegal decision to exclude the People's Republic of China and admit the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique. The Universal Postal Union authorities, disregarding the opinions of the majority of member states and ignoring the protests from our country, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, illegally deprived the already established right of representation of the People's Republic of China at the Saint Gallen Executive and Liaison Committee meeting in May 1951. This is a completely absurd and absolutely intolerable act.
    The 13th Universal Postal Congress is now being held in Brussels. I hereby notify the Congress on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Su Younong, Director of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, as the chief delegate to the 13th Universal Postal Congress, and demands that the Congress immediately expel the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique. I also solemnly declare: If the representatives of the US government and its satellite countries dare to continue to be hostile to the Chinese people, obstruct the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, or still admit the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnant clique, the United States and its satellite countries shall bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom; moreover, if this Congress is held without the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China, all its resolutions will be illegal and therefore invalid.
    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
    May 17, 1952, in Beijing

    周恩来外长致电万国邮政大会
    通知任命苏幼农为我出席大会首席代表
    要求立即驱逐国民党残余集团非法代表
    【新华社十七日讯】万国邮政联盟已于五月十四日起在比利时布鲁塞尔召开第十三届万国邮政大会，联盟各会员国都有权派遣代表参加。中国为会员国之一，但这次万国邮政联盟当局不顾我政府屡次的抗议和警告，竟未曾邀请我国政府派代表赴会，而非法容纳国民党反动残余集团的代表参加。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长为此于五月十七日致电大会，通知任命我邮政总局苏幼农局长为出席本届大会首席代表，并要求大会立即驱逐蒋匪帮的非法“代表”。周外长的电文如下：比利时布鲁塞尔万国邮政大会并转各国代表团：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国的唯一合法政府。在台湾一小撮早已被中国人民抛弃了的国民党反动残余集团绝对没有资格代表伟大的中国。任何国际组织和国际会议，如果阻挠中华人民共和国代表的参加，或竟容纳国民党反动残余集团的所谓代表，都是侵犯中国人民合法权利的非法行为。
    中国是万国邮政联盟的一个会员国，中华人民共和国的代表是代表中国参加该联盟各项会议的唯一合法代表。一九五零年五月中华人民共和国代表曾参加了蒙特罗执行及联络委员会会议，复于一九五一年一、二月间参加了在开罗举行的执行及联络委员会与国际航空运输协会的联席会议。一九五零年十二月中华人民共和国邮政当局并接受了万国邮政公约。中华人民共和国代表在万国邮政联盟中的合法地位是早经上述事实确定了的。
    但开罗会议后，由于美国政府的挟持与操纵，万国邮政联盟国际局竟无理地发出通函征询各会员国对我国代表权的意见，并根据八十六个会员国家中三十三国支持国民党反动残余集团的少数，作了排斥中华人民共和国而容纳国民党反动残余集团的非法决定。万国邮政联盟当局漠视多数会员国的意见，不顾我国、苏联、捷克及匈牙利等国的抗议，于一九五一年五月圣加棱执行及联络委员会会议时，竟非法剥夺已经确定了的中华人民共和国代表权，这是完全荒谬和绝对不能容忍的行为。
    第十三届万国邮政大会现在正在布鲁塞尔举行，我现代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府通知大会：中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命我邮电部邮政总局局长苏幼农为参加第十三届万国邮政大会的首席代表，并要求大会立即驱逐国民党反动残余集团的非法代表。我并郑重声明：如果美国政府及其仆从国家的代表胆敢继续与中国人民为敌，阻挠中华人民共和国代表的参加，或仍容纳国民党残余集团的所谓代表，美国及其仆从国家应对由此而产生之一切后果负完全责任；而且，本届大会如无中华人民共和国代表参加，则其一切决议都将是非法的，因而也是无效的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府
    外交部部长周恩来
    一九五二年五月十七日于北京
