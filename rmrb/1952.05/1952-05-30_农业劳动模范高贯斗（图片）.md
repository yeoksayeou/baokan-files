Agricultural Labor Model Gao Guandou
    By Li Hua and Yu Xuexin

    Seven. Gao Guandou's greatest creation in improving production was turning alkaline land into good land. There are three types of alkaline land in Dahu Village: black alkaline land, white alkaline land, and active alkaline land. Except for active alkaline land where alkali-resistant plants such as cotton and winter melon can be grown, the black and white alkaline lands are transformed by replacing the soil (digging pits eight inches wide and deep in the alkaline land and replacing them with good soil). After three years, they are transformed into good land. Land that used to produce a maximum of three dou of grain per mu can now produce more than one shi.

    Eight. In order to encourage everyone to transform alkaline land and increase production, Gao Guandou initiated the organization of an alkaline land cooperative, using cooperative farming methods to transform alkaline land. Now, there is not a single piece of alkaline land in the whole village that is barren.

    Nine. After the success of Gao Guandou's alkaline land transformation method, farmers from surrounding villages came to learn. Now this method has been widely promoted in the rural areas of Shen County.

    农业劳动模范高贯斗

    七、高贯斗在改进生产中的最大创造，就是变碱地为好地。大护驾庄的碱地有三种：黑碱地、白碱地与活碱地。除了活碱地上能种抗碱的植物如棉花、北瓜等外，黑、白碱地，都用换土的方法（在碱地上挖八寸宽深的坑，换上好土）加以改造，三年后就变成了好地。过去每亩最多产三斗粮的地，现在已经能产一石多了。
    八、高贯斗为了鼓励大家改造碱地，增加生产，发起了碱地合作社的组织，用合作代耕的方法改造碱地。现在全庄没有一块碱地是荒废的。
    九、高贯斗改造碱地的方法试验成功以后，四周乡村的农民都来学习。现在这个方法已经在深县农村中普遍推广。
