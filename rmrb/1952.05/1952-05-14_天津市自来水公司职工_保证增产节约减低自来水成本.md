    Tianjin Waterworks Employees
    Guarantee Increased Production and Conservation to Reduce Water Costs
    Respected Chairman Mao: Under your leadership and that of the People's Government, the employees of our Tianjin Waterworks have already exceeded the annual production and financial plan for last year. The average annual water leakage rate has been reduced to 18.4 percent, setting a new national record. The unit cost of water sold was reduced by 7.5 percent compared to the plan. The amount of water sold and the number of newly installed households both exceeded the original plan. This year, we have formally implemented a comprehensive economic accounting system.
    Based on the victory in production last year, and after the great "Three-Anti" movement, we completed the task of increasing production and practicing economy in the first quarter, exceeding the original task by 8.49 percent. We have decided to launch a patriotic labor competition in May, responding to the challenge of workers in various factories. We put forward the following guarantee conditions:
    (1) Increase Production, Practice Economy, and Reduce Costs: In May, we will increase the amount of water sold by 1 percent and reduce the cost of water by 5 percent. Reduce the water leakage rate by 10 percent and reduce working capital by 2 percent. After reducing the water price, we guarantee to complete the original plan and exceed the original planned surplus figure by 1.7 percent.
    (2) Strengthen Workshop Work and Improve Systems: Adjust the organizational structure, promote worker cadres, strengthen workshop leadership, improve the workshop original record system, and continue to improve and establish production management systems for materials, business, and capital construction departments. Eliminate corruption and waste and improve work efficiency.
    (3) Guarantee Water Quality and Safe Water Supply: Strengthen the inspection of water quality, conscientiously protect water sources, and ensure that the quality of clean water leaving the factory meets water quality standards throughout the month; and carry out a safe operation movement to ensure safe water supply throughout the city during the entire month.
    (4) Reduce Water Prices: Starting in May, the price of every 100 gallons of water will be reduced by 50 yuan to reduce the burden on citizens.

    在去年生产胜利的基础上，经过伟大的“三反”运动，我们完成了第一季增产节约任务，并超过原任务的百分之八点四九。我们决定在五月开展爱国主义劳动竞赛，响应各工厂工人的挑战。我们提出以下的保证条件：
    （一）增产节约，减低成本：在五月内要增产售水量百分之一，减低自来水成本百分之五。减低漏水率百分之十，减低流动资金百分之二。减低水价后，保证完成原计划，并超额积累原计划百分之一点七的盈余数字。
    （二）加强车间工作，健全制度：调整组织机构，提拔工人干部，加强车间领导，健全车间原始记录制度，并继续健全和建立材料、业务及基本建设等部门的生产管理制度。杜绝贪污、浪费，提高工作效率。
    （三）保证水质，安全供水：加强对水质的检查，认真保护水源，保证全月出厂的清水合乎水质标准；并开展安全运转运动，保证全月全市区内安全供水。
