Title: U.S. Side's Sit-Down Strike Continues to Delay and Sabotage Negotiations, Proving the So-Called "Concern" for POWs' Fate is a Complete Lie

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 9th: (By our correspondent Shen Jiantu) Just as the ten-month-long armistice negotiations were entering the final, decisive stage, the American negotiators at Panmunjom, on orders from Washington, staged a sit-down strike, intending to continue delaying or even sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

Originally, the draft armistice agreement was already prepared and waiting only to be signed. If it weren't for the American negotiators going back on their word, if it weren't for their unwillingness to seek a solution to the POW issue based on the "March 21st proposal" of the Korean-Chinese delegation, a final and complete agreement could have been reached weeks ago. The fair and reasonable compromise solution proposed by the Korean-Chinese side originally advocated that the American side release and repatriate all the POWs who should be fully repatriated, a reasonable number between 116,000 and 130,000, while the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army would release and repatriate all the 12,000 POWs who should be fully repatriated—more than the total number of POWs listed on the exchange list last December, because new POWs have been added since last December.

Now, it is clear that a final and complete agreement does not conform to the American plan to delay the realization of the Korean armistice. The materials from the secret meetings clearly reveal the shameful and capricious face of the American aggressors. Unless world opinion and the American people exert enough pressure, the American aggressors will never be willing to cease hostilities. The published negotiation documents also expose the inhumane plan of the American aggressors to prevent tens of thousands of POWs from returning to their homes and reuniting with their families. The only difference this time is that the chief American representative, together with Ridgway and Truman, shamelessly told the world that they would forcibly detain 100,000 of the 170,000 POWs they had once acknowledged, in order to sabotage the armistice negotiations.

The Americans thus refused to negotiate a final solution to the remaining issues, exposing their previous so-called concern for the fate of the POWs as a complete lie. Last November, the American spokesman clamored that they refused to determine the military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone on the map, because this would ease the military pressure necessary to force the Korean-Chinese side to release POWs. Now, Ridgway and Joy brazenly tell the world that in order to obtain more than 100,000 POWs to serve the American's ambitious plan for world domination, they do not care at all about the release of their own captured personnel.

The White House and the Pentagon are indifferent to their own captured personnel. This cruel heart most powerfully reveals the truth that the so-called "basic moral and humanitarian" considerations in American deceptive propaganda are actually aimed at handing over the Korean-Chinese POWs to the deadly enemies of the Korean-Chinese people to be manipulated. The recent passive and sluggish actions by the United States to undermine the negotiations show that the U.S. government does not care at all about the desire of American, British, and other POWs to return to their countries and homes, let alone the wishes of Korean-Chinese POWs. Ridgway's recent propaganda statement in Tokyo that "our position is that we cannot and will not back down" only further illustrates that the United States has no intention of achieving an armistice or releasing and repatriating POWs.

Observers who have been watching the armistice negotiations since last July point out that this is not the first time that American negotiators have threatened to break off negotiations. Ridgway interrupted the negotiations for more than two months, conducting their ill-fated summer and autumn offensives, attempting to force the Korean-Chinese representatives to accept their demand to extort 12,000 square kilometers of territory from North Korea. His attempt failed and he had to resume negotiations. Later, he threatened to use "military pressure" to support the American demand to seize Kaesong. His intimidation again went bankrupt, and Kaesong is still in the hands of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

In the following five months, American representatives made a show of force by threatening to "let cannons, bombs, and bullets continue the debate," attempting to force the Korean-Chinese side to accept the American demand to prohibit the construction of airfields. For months, American newspapers used the ghost of "air threat" to intimidate the American people, and now nonchalantly tell the American people that the U.S. withdrawal of this demand is "beneficial" to the U.S. plan to increase military forces in southern Korea. Washington news published in American newspapers has indicated that the airfield issue is another propaganda hoax, the purpose of which is to stir up domestic war hysteria and delay the Panmunjom armistice negotiations. This hoax has achieved its purpose, so the American representatives finally treated the withdrawal of this issue as a "concession."

Since the Korean-Chinese representatives proposed a compromise plan on May 2, a final and complete agreement can be reached at any time as long as the U.S. government wants an armistice. The Korean-Chinese representatives are willing to accept the American proposal to nominate four neutral countries to supervise the implementation of the armistice agreement, but the American side must abandon its thoroughly refuted demand to interfere in our internal affairs regarding the restriction of airfield facilities and accept the compromise solution proposed by our side on the POW issue.

The only obstacle now preventing the realization of the Korean armistice is the American's barbaric demand to forcibly detain our captured personnel. The Korean-Chinese representatives have rejected this unacceptable demand because they cannot agree to the inhumane principle of preventing POWs from returning to their country and homes. Authoritative sources said that the Korean-Chinese side must fight to the end for a fair and reasonable Korean armistice, and they firmly uphold the right of POWs to return home as stipulated in the Geneva Convention and international law. The process of the ten-month-long armistice negotiations fully proves that no threat can divert them from this goal.

### 美方代表静坐怠工继续拖延和破坏谈判  证明所谓“关怀”战俘命运乃是漫天大谎

    美方代表静坐怠工继续拖延和破坏谈判
    证明所谓“关怀”战俘命运乃是漫天大谎
    【新华社开城九日电】本社记者沈建图报道：正当历时十个月的停战谈判进入最后的决定性阶段的时候，板门店的美国谈判代表们奉华盛顿的命令，实行了静坐怠工，意图继续拖延甚至破坏停战谈判。
    本来，停战协定草案早已经准备好，只等候签字了，要不是因为美国谈判代表自食其言，要不是因为他们不愿根据朝中代表团“三月二十一日的建议”求得战俘问题的解决，最后和完全的协议本来在几个星期之前就可以达成。朝中方面的公平合理的折衷解决办法原主张美国方面释放和遣返所有应予全部遣返的十一万六千到十三万名之间的合理数目的战俘，而朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面则释放和遣返所有应予全部遣返的一万二千名战俘——因为已经加上了去年十二月以后新的战俘，故比去年十二月交换的战俘名单上列举的战俘总数还要多一点。
    现在，显然看得出，最后的完全协议是不符合于美国拖延朝鲜停战的实现的计划的。秘密会议的材料明显地表明美国侵略者反复无常的可耻面目。除非世界舆论和美国人民逼得实在紧，否则美国侵略者是决不愿停战的。根据已发表的谈判文献也揭露了美国侵略者要阻止成千上万战俘返回家园和他们的亲人团聚的非人道计划。这一次唯一不同之处是：美方首席代表连同李奇微和杜鲁门一起无耻地向全世界说，他们要强迫扣留他们曾经承认的十七万战俘中的十万名战俘，以破坏停战谈判。
    美国人就这样拒绝协商剩余问题的最后解决，这就揭露了它以前所谓关怀战俘命运乃是漫天大谎。去年十一月美方发言人曾经高声叫嚣说，他们拒绝在地图上确定军事分界线和非军事区，因为这样就会和缓压迫朝中方面释放战俘所必需的军事压力。现在，李奇微和乔埃截然地向全世界说，为了取得十万余名战俘为美国称霸世界的狂妄计划效力，他们毫不关心他们自己的被俘人员的释放问题。
    白宫和五角大楼漠不关心他们自己的被俘人员。这种残暴心肠，最有力地揭露了美国欺骗宣传中所谓美国怀有“基本道义和人道主义”的考虑其实是要把朝中战俘送给朝中人民的死敌去摆布的真相。美国最近想要破坏谈判的消极怠工的行动，表明了美国政府丝毫不顾念美、英和其他各国战俘想要回国和返乡的愿望，更不用说朝中战俘的愿望了。最近李奇微在东京发表宣传声明说：“我们的立场是我们不能而且也决不退让”，这仅仅再一次说明美国不打算实现停战，不打算释放和遣返战俘。
    自从去年七月以来一直注视停战谈判的观察家指出：美国谈判代表以谈判破裂相威胁，这并不是第一次。李奇微曾使谈判中断两个多月，进行他们的出师不吉的夏季和秋季攻势，妄图借此强迫朝中代表接受他们勒索北朝鲜一万二千平方公里领土的要求。他的企图失败了，并且不得不恢复谈判。后来他又扬言使用“军事压力”以支持美方强索开城的要求。他的恐吓又破产了，而开城仍在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的手中。
    在后来的五个月之内，美国代表虚张声势地扬言要“让大炮、炸弹和子弹去继续辩论”，妄图迫使朝中方面接受美方禁止修筑机场的要求。数月以来，美国报纸用“空中威胁”的鬼话来恫吓美国人民，现在又若无其事地告诉美国人民说：美国收回这个要求，对于美国在朝鲜南部增加军事力量的计划是“有好处的”。美国报纸刊载的华盛顿消息已指明飞机场问题是另一场宣传骗局，其目的在于煽起国内的战争歇斯底里和拖延板门店的停战谈判。这场骗局已达到目的，于是美方代表最后又把撤回这个问题当作一种“让步”。
    由于朝中代表已于五月二日提出折衷方案，只要美国政府希望停战，双方随时都可以达成最后的完全的协议。朝中代表愿意接受美方所提的提名四个中立国监督执行停战协议的建议，但美方要放弃其已被驳得体无完肤的干涉我方内政的限制机场设备问题和接受我方提出的关于战俘问题的折衷解决办法。
    现在妨碍朝鲜停战实现的唯一障碍是美方所提的强迫扣留我方被俘人员的横蛮要求。朝中代表已拒绝这个不可接受的要求，因为他们不能同意阻止战俘返国回家的违反人道的原则。权威人士说，朝中方面一定要为争取公平合理的朝鲜停战而战斗到底，他们坚决维护日内瓦公约和国际法中所规定的战俘回家的权利。历时十个月的停战谈判的进程，充分证明任何威胁都是不能使他们离开这个目标的。
