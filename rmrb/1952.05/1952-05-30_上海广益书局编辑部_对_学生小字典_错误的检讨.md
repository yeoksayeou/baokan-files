    Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in the "Student Little Dictionary"
    Editor: Zheng Dagong's letter, published in the People's Daily's "Reader's Letters" section on May 14th, criticized our bookstore's publication of the "Student Little Dictionary." This criticism is extremely accurate. In addition to sincerely accepting this criticism, our bookstore has stopped selling the book since May 17th.

    This dictionary was published before liberation, and we had planned to completely revise and reset it after liberation. However, because the book was priced relatively low and there were many buyers in various regions, we reprinted and sold it in December 1951 without revision. This is clearly a profit-seeking perspective. We are willing to correct this irresponsible attitude towards readers.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    对“学生小字典”错误的检讨
    编辑同志：五月十四日人民日报读者来信专页发表了郑大公同志的来信，对我店出版的“学生小字典”提出批评，这一批评极为正确。我店除诚恳接受这一批评外，并于五月十七日起将此书停止发售。
    这本字典是解放前出版的，解放后曾打算全部修改重排。但因该书定价较廉，各地购买者甚多，我们在一九五一年十二月间没有修改便重印销售。这显然是一种单纯营利观点。我们愿意改正这种对读者不负责任的作风。
