Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 20th: The people of southern Korea, under the cruel rule of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang, are engaged in an increasingly fierce and valiant resistance.

Under American occupation, bankruptcy, hunger, and poverty are widespread in South Korea. Due to the rampant printing of banknotes by the Rhee puppet gang, inflation has reached unbelievable levels. According to the South Korean Hapdong News Agency, the amount of currency in circulation reached 665 billion won on March 15th of this year, compared to only 55.8 billion won in June 1950. The American interventionist army is shamelessly plundering South Korea. The U.S. military recently shipped one million bags of rice (one bag equals 160 kilograms) to Japan and is now planning to ship another 1.5 million bags to Japan. As a result of this plunder, famine in South Korea is becoming increasingly serious. The Syngman Rhee gang forces farmers to hand over all their grain. Farmers in Gyeongsangnam-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do have been living on grass roots and bark for three or four months, but the Rhee puppet gang still demands large amounts of rice from them. In addition to paying taxes in kind, South Korean farmers must also pay 265 different types of taxes and "contributions." In January of this year, Seoul only issued rations for seven days, there were no rations at all in February, and only ten days of rations were issued in March. In Busan, residents have not received a single grain of rationed food for three months.

To oppose this mad exploitation and extortion, the people of southern Korea have launched an increasingly strong resistance. They have organized "National Salvation Struggle Alliances" to cooperate with the people's guerrillas and actively fight for the unification, independence, and freedom of the fatherland. Branches of this organization were established in various parts of southern Korea in April. To crush the Syngman Rhee gang's deceptive conspiracy of so-called "local autonomy elections," the "National Salvation Struggle Alliance" organization in Seoul distributed tens of thousands of leaflets on all streets of the city on the evening of April 23rd, calling on all South Korean people to join patriotic organizations and rise up to carry out the national salvation struggle to overthrow the American-Syngman Rhee gang. At the same time, a large number of such leaflets were also distributed in many cities such as Chungju and Gwangju. People from all walks of life, especially the working people, generally support the program of the "National Salvation Struggle Alliance" and warmly respond to its call. Workers in factories, enterprises, mines, and seaports have also stepped up their struggle against the American-Syngman Rhee gang. Workers at the Incheon docks and salt pans, and workers at the Joseon Textile Factory have held strikes. The enemy's largest military supply factory—the Busan First Arsenal—and the Daegu Monopoly Bureau Factory have been sabotaged. The vast number of farmers have also organized themselves to oppose bloody plunder. Industrialists, businessmen, and citizens in the cities are disrupting the puppet government's tax collection. Under the slogans "We want food!" and "We want freedom!", patriots attacked puppet county offices (county governments) and granaries in Jochiwon, Chungcheongnam-do, and Hampyeong, Jeollanam-do; attacked puppet offices in various districts (areas) in Ulsan, Dongnae, and Hadong counties, Gyeongsangnam-do, disrupting the election sites of the so-called "local autonomy elections"; and attacked enemy police stations in Gwangju, Jeollanam-do, and Jeongeup, Jeollabuk-do, purging reactionary candidates. This caused the enemy's so-called "local autonomy elections" on April 25 to fail everywhere. The people's guerrillas in various places, standing at the forefront of the struggle, are more actively cooperating in the activities. The Lee Hyun-sang guerrilla unit raided Hadong County, Gyeongsangnam-do, on April 23rd, burned down the puppet county office, and annihilated the enemy in the area.

The heroic struggle of the South Korean people has further shaken the enemy's rear, causing panic and dismay to the American-Syngman Rhee gang. The reactionary newspapers such as "Seoul News" and "Kyunghyang Shinmun" on April 26th all revealed a very pessimistic tone in their related reports.
Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: TASS, Pyongyang, May 18th: Korean newspapers and magazines have again revealed some of the monstrous crimes committed by the aggressors during the temporary occupation of parts of North Korea and which they are still committing.

The "New Korea" magazine pointed out that the crimes committed by the aggressors are no less than those committed by the Hitler gang during World War II. The magazine said that the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. military are organized and planned. New discoveries have been made regarding the crimes committed by the interventionists against the peaceful residents of Korea. For example, during the temporary occupation of Heecheon, the aggressors shot fifty randomly arrested local residents and beheaded them for public display. In Byeoncheon (transliteration), seventy civilians were burned alive. In Sincheon County, a cave with a blocked entrance was discovered, containing the bodies of more than forty women and children who had been burned alive. In Uncheol (transliteration) Village, American soldiers found several villagers holding Korean Workers' Party membership cards and rounded them up and shot them all by the river. When the relatives of the victims requested to collect the bodies, the savage soldiers dragged the bodies of the victims out of the river and publicly disemboweled and beheaded them. When the American aggressors occupied a certain village in Suncheon County, they arrested residents on a large scale and drove all the arrested people into caves, leaving them to starve and thirst to death. The total number of civilians who died there reached 2,890. In Henghe-ri (transliteration), Hwangju County, Hwanghae Province, an American soldier raped a female teacher and then shot her. The teacher's son, who was only three years old, ran to his mother's body and was also brutally murdered. In Lai Ni (transliteration), the aggressors drove twenty-eight women into a well and then stoned them to death.

    朝鲜南部人民英勇反抗美李匪帮的暴政
    各地“救国斗争同盟”配合人民游击队打击敌人的阴谋
    【新华社平壤二十日电】在美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮残酷统治下的朝鲜南部人民，正在日益炽烈地展开英勇的反抗。
    在美国占领下，破产、饥饿和贫困遍于南朝鲜。由于李伪匪帮滥发钞票，通货膨胀已达到令人不能相信的程度。据南朝鲜合同通讯社说：在本年三月十五日，流通中的通货数量已达到六千六百五十亿元，而在一九五零年六月还只有五百五十八亿元。美国干涉军正在无耻地掠夺南朝鲜。美军最近把一百万包大米（一包等于一百六十公斤）运往日本，现在正计划再运一百五十万包到日本去。由于这种掠夺的结果，南朝鲜的饥荒正日益严重。李承晚匪帮强迫农民缴纳他们的全部粮食。庆尚南道和庆尚北道的农民已经有三、四个月一直靠吃草根和树皮生活，但是李伪匪帮仍然要他们缴纳大量的米粮。除了缴纳实物税以外，南朝鲜的农民还必须缴纳二百六十五种不同的捐税和“献金”。在本年一月份，汉城只发了七天的配售粮，二月份根本没有粮食配售，三月份只发了十天的配售粮。在釜山，居民有三个月一粒配售粮也得不到。
    为了反对这种疯狂的剥削和榨取，朝鲜南部的人民展开了日益强烈的反抗。他们组织了“救国斗争同盟”，配合人民游击队，积极为争取祖国的统
    一、独立与自由而斗争。这个组织的分支机构已在四月间在朝鲜南部各地纷纷成立。为了粉碎李承晚匪帮欺骗人民的所谓“地方自治选举”阴谋，汉城市的“救国斗争同盟”组织在四月二十三日晚在市内所有街道上散布了数万张传单，号召南朝鲜全体人民参加爱国组织、奋起进行打倒美李匪帮的救国斗争。同时在忠州、光州等许多城市，也有大量这样的传单散布。各界人民特别是劳动人民普遍地拥护“救国斗争同盟”的纲领，热烈响应它的号召。各工厂、企业、矿山和海港中的工人也加强了反对美李匪帮的斗争。仁川码头与盐田的工人，和朝鲜纺织工厂工人都举行了罢工。敌人的最大军需工厂——釜山第一兵工厂，和大邱市专卖局工厂都被破坏。广大农民也有组织地起来反对血腥的掠夺。城市中的工商业者与市民则破坏着伪政府的税收。在
    “要粮食！”、“要自由！”的口号下，爱国人士在忠清南道鸟致院与全罗南道咸平等地袭击了伪郡厅（县府）与粮仓；在庆尚南道蔚山、东莱与河东等郡袭击了各面（区）的伪事务所，扰乱了所谓“地方自治选举”的选举场；在全罗南道的光州与全罗北道的井邑等地袭击了敌人的派出所，肃清了反动的候选人。这样就使得敌人在四月二十五日的所谓“地方自治选举”到处流产。站在斗争最前列的各地人民游击队更积极地配合活动。李铉相游击队在四月二十三日就曾奇袭庆尚南道的河东郡，烧毁了伪郡厅，歼灭了该地的敌人。
    南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争愈加动摇了敌人的后方，使美李匪帮惊惶失措。四月二十六日的“汉城新闻”、“京乡新闻”等反动报纸在其有关的报道中都流露了十分悲观的论调。
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社平壤十八日讯：朝鲜的报章杂志又揭露了一些侵略者在暂时占领北朝鲜部分地区期间所犯的和现在正在犯的滔天罪行。
    “新朝鲜”杂志指出：侵略者所犯的罪行，比希特勒匪帮在第二次世界大战中所犯的有过之而无不及。这个杂志说：美国军队所犯的滔天大罪是有组织、有计划的。干涉者对朝鲜和平居民所犯的罪行又有了新的发现。例如：侵略者在暂时占领熙川期间，曾枪杀被随意抓去的当地居民五十人，并把他们斩首示众。在边川（译音），平民七十人被活活烧死。在信川郡发现有一个入口被堵塞了的地洞，里面有四十多个被活活烧死的妇女和儿童的尸体。在云哲（译音）村，美国士兵曾因发现几个村民持有朝鲜劳动党党证，就把他们全部赶到河边枪杀。当被害者的亲属请求收尸时，兽兵们却把被害者的尸体从河里拖上来，当众剖腹斩首。当美国侵略者占领顺天郡某里时，他们曾大规模逮捕居民，并把所有被捕的人赶入地洞里，让他们饥渴而死。死在那里的平民共达二千八百九十人之多。在黄海道黄州郡恒河里（译音），美国士兵强奸了一个女教师，随后把她枪杀了。这个教师的年仅三岁的儿子跑到他母亲尸体旁，也惨被杀害。在莱尼（译音），侵略者曾把二十八名妇女赶下井里，随后用石头把她们打死。
