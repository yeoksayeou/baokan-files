Welcome to the Trade Union Delegations from All Countries
    Liu Ningyi

    We, the Chinese working class and all the laboring people, are welcoming you with incomparable joy to the capital of New China to participate in this year's great May Day International Labor Day celebration.

    May Day International Labor Day is a great festival for the working people of the world to review their strength and a festival of solidarity and friendship for the worker brothers of all countries. The arrival of trade union delegations from various countries specifically demonstrates the unity and friendship between worker brothers all over the world. Let us cheer to our heart's content! Let us congratulate the close unity of the world's working class!

    The Chinese working class has always had deep internationalist feelings, and the Chinese working class fully understands the truth that "workers of the world are one family." But in the past, in the era when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ruled China, the reactionaries obstructed us, preventing us from freely interacting and communicating with the working classes of the world. Under the leadership of the brilliant leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the help of the Soviet Union and the working class of the world, the Chinese people, through long-term and resolute struggle, overthrew the rule of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in China, and liberated the Chinese people. The Chinese working class has become the leading class of the country, so we can welcome our sincere friends from all directions - the trade union delegations from all countries - in the capital of New China. This is a great victory for the Chinese people and also a victory for the great unity of the working people of the world.

    Although the political systems and socio-economic systems of various countries in the world are not the same, and although the languages, writing, and even living habits of worker brothers in various countries are not the same. However, we are all workers, we all love peace, we all want to live and work in a peaceful environment, we all hope that the working conditions of workers can be improved day by day, we all hope that the living standards of the working class and all working people will improve day by day, and we all hope that the rights of the working class's own organization - the trade union - will be guaranteed and respected. Therefore, our interests are consistent, and our demands and wishes are also consistent. This consistency makes the unity between us as unbreakable as iron, and makes the friendship between us have the most solid foundation.

    The Chinese working class and laboring people not only welcome you with joy and excitement, but also want to learn from you enthusiastically and exchange experiences with you, so that our close friendship can be further consolidated. This is not only a historically significant event in the history of the Chinese workers' movement, but also a historically significant event in the history of the workers' movement in Asia and the world. Let us jointly celebrate this historically significant festival - the great May Day International Labor Day of unity and friendship among the working class and laboring people of the world.

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese working class and laboring people are fighting to build their great motherland. Since liberation, our industrial and agricultural production has rapidly recovered and developed, and the working conditions and material life of our workers and peasants have also improved significantly. The Chinese working class not only has complete freedom to organize trade unions, but this freedom of right has been guaranteed by the laws of the state led by the working class. This law is the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China. However, the Chinese working class and laboring people are not satisfied, and they are striving with full confidence for the industrialization of our country. The Chinese working class is continuing to carry out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, and new records on various production fronts and rationalization proposals from the broad masses of workers are constantly emerging. Last year alone, the staff and workers of state-owned and public-owned industries in the Northeast region, by increasing production and practicing economy, tapped the potential of industry and created value for the state equivalent to sixteen million tons of grain beyond the plan. This year, a large-scale production increase and economy campaign will be launched enthusiastically throughout the country, in all industrial and mining enterprises. This is the most important and practical step in our country's preparations for large-scale economic construction.

    The world is created by labor, and laborers should become the masters of the world. As we celebrate May Day International Labor Day this year, worker brothers all over the world should further unite to fight for further improving and raising our living standards! To fight for the rights of trade unions and the democratic rights of the working class, and to fight for the realization of lasting world peace!

    Finally, let us use various languages, in the capital of the victorious Chinese people, to shout to the world:

    Long live the festival of unity of the working people of the world - May Day International Labor Day!

    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　欢迎各国工会代表团
    刘宁一
    我们中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，正怀着无比愉快的心情，热烈欢迎你们到新中国的首都来参加今年的伟大的五一国际劳动节的庆祝典礼。
    五一国际劳动节，是全世界劳动人民检阅自己的力量的伟大节日，是一切国家的工人兄弟团结友爱的节日。各国工会代表团的来临，正是具体地表示着全世界工人兄弟之间的团结和友谊。让我们尽情地欢呼！让我们为世界工人阶级的亲密团结而祝贺罢！
    中国工人阶级一向就有着深厚的国际主义的情感，中国工人阶级十分明白“天下工人是一家”的真理。但是在过去，在蒋介石匪帮统治着中国的时代，反动派阻碍着我们，使我们不能和世界各国的工人阶级自由地来往和互通声气。中国人民在英明的领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，在苏联和全世界工人阶级帮助之下，经过长期的坚决的斗争，推翻了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在中国的统治，使中国人民得到了解放。中国工人阶级成为国家的领导阶级，因此，我们才能在新中国的首都来欢迎我们的真挚友人——来自四面八方的各国工会代表团。这是中国人民的伟大胜利，也是全世界劳动人民伟大团结的胜利。
    尽管世界各个国家的政治制度和社会经济制度并不相同，尽管各国工人兄弟的语言、文字以至生活习惯都不相同。但是，我们都是工人阶级，我们都热爱和平，我们都愿意在和平的环境里生活和劳动，我们都希望工人们的劳动条件能够一天比一天得到改善，我们都希望工人阶级和所有劳动人民的生活水平一天比一天提高，我们都希望工人阶级自己的组织——工会的权利得到保障和尊重。因此，我们的利益是一致的，我们的要求和愿望也是一致的。这种一致性使我们之间的团结像铁一样的牢不可破，使我们之间的友谊有着最巩固的基础。
    中国工人阶级和劳动人民，不仅欢欣鼓舞地欢迎你们，而且要热情地向你们学习，和你们交流经验，使我们亲密的友谊，得到进一步的巩固。这不但在我们中国工人运动的历史上是一件具有历史意义的事情，而且在我们亚洲和全世界工人运动的历史上，也是一件具有历史意义的事情。让我们共同庆祝这个具有历史意义的节日——伟大的全世界工人阶级和劳动人民团结友爱的五一国际劳动节。
    中国工人阶级和劳动人民，正在毛泽东主席领导之下，为建设自己的伟大祖国而斗争。解放以来，我们的工农业生产已经迅速地恢复和发展，我们工人农民的劳动条件和物质生活也有了显著的改善。中国工人阶级不但有了组织工会的完全的自由，而且这种自由的权利，已经取得了工人阶级领导的国家法律的保障。这个法律就是中华人民共和国工会法。但是，中国工人阶级和劳动人民并没有满足，他们正在满怀信心地为我们国家的工业化而奋斗。中国工人阶级正在继续开展着爱国主义的增产节约竞赛运动，各种生产战线上的新纪录和广大工人群众的合理化建议不断地涌现出来。去年一年，仅东北区国营公营工业的职工，用增产节约的方法，发挥了工业潜在力，就超计划地给国家创造了相当于一千六百万吨粮食的价值。今年，大规模的增产节约运动，将要在全国范围内，在一切工矿企业当中热烈展开。这是我们国家准备大规模进行经济建设的最重要，最实际的步骤。
    世界是劳动创造的，劳动者应该成为世界的主人。当我们今年来庆祝五一国际劳动节的时候，全世界的工人兄弟们应该更进一步地团结起来，为进一步改善与提高我们的生活水平而斗争！为争取工会的权利和工人阶级的民主权利而斗争，为实现世界的持久和平而斗争！
    最后，让我们用各种不同的语言，在胜利了的中国人民的首都、向全世界高呼：
    全世界劳动人民团结的节日——五一国际劳动节万岁！
    全世界人民大团结万岁！
