    The Great Achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement
    Teaching Attitudes of Nankai University Teachers are Changing

    To the Editor: After the great "Three-Anti" Movement, a new atmosphere has emerged at our university. In order to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, teachers are studying documents on time and have recently established Marxism-Leninism study groups. Teachers have become serious about teaching, establishing teaching systems and forming teaching research institutions. Meng Guangzhe, the head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, used to be content with his nineteen years of teaching experience and never properly prepared teaching materials. He did not care about the students' learning and looked down on students with poor grades, making them afraid to approach him. Now, before each class, he prepares the teaching materials carefully, lectures logically, and provides assistance and encouragement to students who fail. Professor Yang Zengwu of the Accounting and Statistics Department no longer blindly repeats foreign dogmas when teaching "Statistical Charting." He has begun to implement the spirit of patriotism in teaching, using the gradual improvement of the living conditions of the Chinese working people after liberation as teaching material for "Statistical Charting." He also led a "Preliminary Statistics" teaching research group, promoting the spirit of collective teaching. Each teacher specializes in one chapter, dividing the work and cooperating to make the best use of their abilities.

    Before formally lecturing, the teachers of the "Elementary Statistics" teaching research group first give a trial lecture in the teaching research group. All the teachers and some students of "Elementary Statistics" attend the lecture. After listening to the lecture, everyone offers opinions on the lecturer's teaching content, methods, etc., and the lecturer makes corrections before formally lecturing to the students. Professor Zhu Jianhan, who teaches theoretical chemistry, felt that he could no longer continue his work and lost confidence in teaching because he had criticized his own idealistic views in the "Three-Anti" Movement. The teachers of the theoretical chemistry teaching research group worked with him to edit lecture notes and discuss lecture content. Qiu Zongyue, the Dean of the School of Science, personally attended his lectures, identified shortcomings in his teaching, and discussed them. This greatly encouraged Professor Zhu Jianhan's teaching confidence.

    The emergence of these new phenomena shows that the people's higher education is beginning to shift in a new direction. This is the result of the "Three-Anti" Movement.  Nankai University Correspondence Group

### “三反”运动的伟大成果  南开大学教师教学态度正在转变

    “三反”运动的伟大成果
    南开大学教师教学态度正在转变
    编辑同志：伟大的“三反”运动以后，我校出现了一片新气象。教师们为了有系统地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，按时学习文件，最近成立了马克思列宁主义学习组。教师们对教学都认真起来了，纷纷订立教学的制度，成立研究教学的机构。机械系主任孟广喆过去教书时，满足于自己的十九年教书经验，从来不好好准备教材。他对同学的学习不关心，轻视成绩低劣的同学，使同学不敢和他接近。现在他在上课以前，对教材必有准备，讲书有条有理，对成绩不及格的同学，也给以帮助和鼓励。会计统计系杨曾武教授在讲“统计制图”时，不再搬洋教条了。他开始在教学中贯彻爱国主义的精神，用解放后中国劳动人民生活逐步上升的情况，作为“统计制图”的教材。他又领导了一个“初步统计学”教学研究组，发挥了集体教学的精神。教师们各人专讲一章，分工合作，作到了各尽所能。
    “初等统计学”教学研究组的教师，在正式讲课以前，先在教学研究组试讲一次，“初等统计学”的全体教师和部分同学都去听讲。听讲后，大家对主讲人的教学内容、方法等方面提出意见，主讲人加以修正，才正式对学生进行讲授。讲授理论化学的朱剑寒教授，由于在“三反”运动中批判了自己那一套唯心论的观点，曾经觉得没法继续工作下去了，对教学失去了信心；理论化学教学研究组的教师们就一起和他编辑讲义，讨论讲课内容；理学院院长邱宗岳并亲自听他讲课，找出教学中的缺点，加以讨论。这就大大地鼓舞了朱剑寒教授的教学信心。
    这些新气象的出现，正说明了人民高等教育事业已经开始向新的方向转变，这是“三反”运动的成果。  南开大学通讯组
