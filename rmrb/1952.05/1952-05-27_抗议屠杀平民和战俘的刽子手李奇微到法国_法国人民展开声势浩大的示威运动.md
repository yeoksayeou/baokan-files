Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: Paris Dispatch: Ridgway, the butcher of the Korean people, is scheduled to arrive in Paris on May 27th to replace Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic aggressive forces. Now, the angry French working people have launched a massive demonstration movement to protest the arrival of this "germ warfare general," Ridgway. On the 23rd, despite the Paris Police Commissioner's ban, the working people of Paris held large-scale demonstrations in five locations: Saint-Lazare train station, the Latin Quarter, the Odeon Square, Boulogne, and Billancourt. Demonstrators held up signs that read: "Ridgway - Butcher!" "Ridgway - Plague!" "Ridgway, Get Out!" "Yankees, Go Home!" Similar demonstrations and parades were also held in the factory districts of suburban Paris. Parisian workers also wrote slogans against Ridgway in large characters on the roads, so that Ridgway could see their protests from the plane. The French authorities mobilized 40,000 to 50,000 troops and police to attack the demonstrators and arrested about 300 people, but the demonstration movement continued. On the morning of the 24th, the police authorities also arrested Stet, the editor-in-chief of the French Communist Party's newspaper "l'Humanité".

Many other cities in France have also launched demonstrations protesting Ridgway's arrival in France. In Bordeaux, demonstrators burned pamphlets weighing dozens of kilograms that touted the "Marshall Plan" and the so-called "American way of life." In Nice, shipyard workers held a protest strike. In Saint-Louis, dockworkers held a protest rally.

The Peace Committee of the Seine province, where Paris is located, issued an appeal, pointing out that Ridgway's arrival is to intensify the occupation of France and to accelerate the rearmament of West Germany, and that Ridgway intends to bring napalm bombs, bacteriological weapons, and the means of mass murder of civilians and prisoners to Europe. The Seine Provincial Peace Committee called on all men and women in Paris to participate in protest demonstrations on the day after Ridgway's arrival in Paris (May 28th). This call has been supported by the Executive Bureau of the French National Peace Council. The Executive Bureau specifically issued a communique, expressing its full agreement with the decision of the Seine Provincial Peace Committee.

    抗议屠杀平民和战俘的刽子手李奇微到法国
    法国人民展开声势浩大的示威运动
    【新华社二十六日讯】巴黎消息：屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手李奇微定于五月二十七日抵达巴黎，接替艾森豪威尔为北大西洋侵略军总司令。现在，愤怒的法国劳动人民已经展开了一个声势浩大的示威运动，抗议这位“细菌战将军”李奇微的到来。二十三日，巴黎劳动人民不顾警察总监的禁令，在圣拉萨火车站、拉丁区、奥地翁广场、布伦和比扬古等五个地方，举行了大示威。示威者举着标语牌，上面写道：“李奇微——刽子手！”“李奇微——瘟神！”“李奇微滚回去！”“美国佬滚回去！”在巴黎市郊的工厂区，人们也举行了同样的示威游行。巴黎工人还用大字在公路上写上反对李奇微的标语，好叫李奇微还在飞机上就可以看见他们的抗议。法国当局动员了四五万军警向示威者进攻，并且逮捕了约三百人，但是示威运动继续进行。二十四日晨，警察当局又逮捕了法国共产党机关报“人道报”的总编辑斯泰。
    法国其他许多城市也展开了抗议李奇微前来法国的示威运动。在波尔多，示威者把重达好几十公斤的吹嘘“马歇尔计划”和所谓“美国生活方式”的小册子，付之一炬。在尼斯，造船工人们举行了抗议罢工。在圣路易，码头工人们举行了抗议大会。
    巴黎所在的塞纳省的和平委员会发表呼吁书，指出李奇微的到来是为了加紧占领法国和加紧武装西德，并且指出李奇微要把凝固汽油弹、细菌武器和大规模杀害平民与俘虏的手段带到欧洲去。塞纳省和平委员会号召巴黎全体男女在李奇微到达巴黎的第二天（二十八日）参加抗议示威。这个号召已得到法国全国和平理事会执行局的支持。执行局特地发表了公报，表示完全同意塞纳省和平委员会的决定。
