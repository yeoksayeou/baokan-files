Readers' Letters

    The British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately stop the crimes of persecuting our people in Hong Kong.
    --Summary of Readers' Letters

    The broad masses of readers have expressed their immense indignation at the series of atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong in continuously arresting, deporting, and persecuting our people, and in unreasonably ordering the suspension of publication of the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao.

    Tai Tianren of the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry wrote: I fully support the solemn statement issued by our Central People's Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 10th; the British Government in Hong Kong should immediately revoke the illegal judgments against the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" and its staff, otherwise the British Government in Hong Kong must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from these illegal atrocities. Xia Chengkun and others of the Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Military Commission wrote: The solemn statement issued by our Central People's Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 10th fully represents the firm will to struggle of the Chinese people. We once again warn the British imperialists that they must immediately stop their criminal acts of persecuting the Chinese people.

    Returned overseas Chinese Liu Songming and others wrote: We want to warn the British Government in Hong Kong that it must immediately stop the atrocities of persecuting our Hong Kong compatriots, must revoke the illegal judgments against the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" and its staff, and abandon the conspiracy to persecute "Wen Wei Po" and "Xin Wan Bao" which is being prepared. The great Chinese people cannot sit idly by in the face of the provocative actions of the British Government in Hong Kong.

    Liu Zhaowei of Beijing Normal University wrote: The act of British imperialism in destroying freedom of speech and deliberately fabricating charges to persecute our patriotic compatriots is a serious insult to our people. We resolutely protest the shameless atrocities of the British Government in Hong Kong.
