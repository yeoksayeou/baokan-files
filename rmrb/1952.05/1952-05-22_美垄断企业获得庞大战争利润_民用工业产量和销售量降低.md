    US Monopoly Enterprises Obtain Huge War Profits
    Civilian Industrial Production and Sales Decrease
    [This Newspaper Despatch] Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Truman’s government’s policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war has helped American monopoly enterprises expand their businesses and seek excess profits; but at the same time, it has caused the production and sales of civilian consumer goods to generally decrease.
    The asset and profit and loss reports of various American industrial companies for 1951, published in the "Wall Street Journal" in February and March this year, showed that the sales volume of the largest monopoly enterprises engaged in war production continued to increase last year compared to the previous year, and increased greatly compared to before the Korean War. For example, the sales volume of US Steel Corporation last year increased by more than half compared to 1949 in terms of US dollars, General Electric Company and DuPont Company each increased by nearly half, Indiana Mobil Oil Company increased by one-third, and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company increased by nearly three-quarters.
    The sharp increase in sales volume brought huge profits to the company bosses. For example, the total profit of US Steel Corporation in 1951 increased by almost double compared to 1949, General Electric Company increased by more than double, DuPont Company and Indiana Mobil Oil Company increased by nearly four-fifths, and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company increased by about two and two-thirds times. A significant exception is General Motors Corporation. The company's profit in 1951 decreased by 18 percent compared to 1950, which was the first occurrence of this phenomenon since 1946. The decrease in profit reflects the decline in the purchasing power of the American people. The company's annual report shows that purely military orders such as tanks, jet aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns increased by $552.2 million. This shows that the increase in military orders is not yet enough to offset the reduction in the civilian market.
    The company's financial reports also show that the sales volume of many civilian consumer goods manufacturing enterprises has rapidly decreased after the buying spree that broke out after the Korean War. For example, the sales volume of American Viscose Corporation decreased by 12 percent last year, and the actual sales volume of International Shoe Company decreased by 6 percent. Most American light industrial companies are now only able to barely maintain their production levels by relying on military orders.

### 美垄断企业获得庞大战争利润  民用工业产量和销售量降低

    美垄断企业获得庞大战争利润
    民用工业产量和销售量降低
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：杜鲁门政府扩军备战政策帮助美国垄断企业扩大生意，谋取超额的利润；但同时却使民用消费品的生产与销售量普遍降低。
    今年二、三月份“华尔街日报”发表的美国各工业公司一九五一年度的资产损益报告显示，从事战争生产的各最大垄断企业，销售量在去年比前年续有增加，比朝鲜战争前增加很大。例如，美国钢铁公司去年销售量以美元计算较一九四九年增加一半以上，奇异电气公司和杜邦公司各增加了将近一半，印第安纳美孚油公司增加了三分之一，固特异轮胎与橡皮公司增加了将近四分之三。
    销售量的剧烈增加带给公司老板们庞大的利润。例如，美国钢铁公司一九五一年全部利润较一九四九年增加了几乎一倍，奇异电气公司增加了一倍以上，杜邦公司和印第安纳美孚油公司增加了将近五分之四，固特异轮胎与橡皮公司增加了约一又三分之二倍，一个有意义的特例是通用汽车公司。该公司一九五一年的利润较一九五○年减少了百分之十八，这是自从一九四六年以来该公司第一次发生的现象。利润的减少反映了美国人民购买力的降低。该公司的年度报告表明，纯属军事的定货如坦克、喷气飞机、高射炮等增加了五亿五千二百万美元。这说明，军事定货的增加还来不及顶补民用市场的缩减。
    公司的财政报告还表明，许多民用消费品制造企业在朝鲜战争后爆发的抢购热潮以后，销售量已迅速减少了。例如美国人造丝公司的销售量在去年减少了百分之十二，国际制鞋公司的实际销售量减少了百分之六。多数美国轻工业公司现在只是依靠军事定货才勉强维持了生产水平。
