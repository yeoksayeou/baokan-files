    Our Working Class Ranks are Stronger

    To the Editor: This year's "May Day" is truly different from previous years. I have an indescribable feeling of joy and elation. Because this year's "May Day" arrives at a time when the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have achieved brilliant victories throughout the country. Relying on the united efforts of our working class, we have basically eliminated the "three evils" from state organs and the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists. Now, the prices of goods have fallen, wages have increased, and the lives of our workers are gradually improving. The ranks of our working class have become stronger and purer. We can advance by leaps and bounds to participate in large-scale national defense construction and economic construction. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow; how beautiful that bright prospect is!

    Over the past year, our workshop has absorbed advanced experience, strengthened labor organization, and reasonably implemented a piece-rate wage system. All of these have greatly promoted the increase of labor productivity. In addition, in the "Three-Anti" struggle, the leadership promptly cultivated and promoted worker cadres, further strengthening workshop management. The production enthusiasm of workers is even higher. In early March, the wire drawing section continuously set three highest records, with iron wire production reaching more than 27,900 kilograms, exceeding last year's by more than 24 percent. On April 21, the Mao Yuqin team created a new record of 30,082 kilograms. Now, a large-scale production competition is underway in all sections of the workshop to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the second quarter's production tasks.

    我们工人阶级队伍更壮大了
    编辑同志：今年的“五一”可真和往年不同。我有一种说不出的痛快和欢欣。因为今年的“五一”，是在毛主席领导的“三反”“五反”运动在全国各地已获得辉煌胜利的时候来临的。靠了我们工人阶级的团结努力，基本上已肃清了国家机构的“三害”和违法资本家的“五毒”。现在，百货落价了，工资提高了，我们工人的生活正在逐步改善。我们工人阶级的队伍，更形壮大和纯洁了。我们可以大踏步地前进，参加大规模的国防建设和经济建设。苏联的今天，就是我们的明天，这个光明的远景，该多么美丽啊！
    一年来，我们车间吸取了先进经验，加强了劳动组织，合理地实行了计件工资制度。这些都促使劳动生产率大大提高。再加上“三反”斗争中，领导方面及时培养和提拔了工人干部，进一步加强了车间管理工作，工人生产情绪更高涨了。三月上旬，伸线工段曾连续创出了三次最高纪录，铁线产量达二万七千九百多公斤，超过去年百分之二十四多。四月二十一日，毛玉勤小组又创造了三万零八十二公斤的新纪录。现在全车间各工段正在展开生产大竞赛，保证提前超额完成第二季度的生产任务。
