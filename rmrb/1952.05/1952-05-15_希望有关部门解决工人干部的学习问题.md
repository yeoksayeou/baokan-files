    Hope Relevant Departments Will Resolve the Learning Problems of Worker Cadres

    Editor: After the "Three-Anti" Movement, our factory promoted a large number of worker cadres. The cultural level of the worker cadres is very low, and their professional skills also need to be improved, so they urgently need to learn. I hope relevant departments will help us solve this problem. First, we hope to establish training classes as soon as possible so that worker cadres can study in rotation. Second, streamline unnecessary meetings so that worker cadres can study in their spare time. Third, we hope that newspapers will introduce more experiences on how worker cadres manage factories.
    Industrial Labor Models: Dong Zhenyuan, Liu Lifu

    Editor: I am a labor model from Zhenyang Power Plant in Yangzhou, Northern Jiangsu. I believe that it is wrong for us to only focus on production without learning. Without learning, we cannot improve our political, cultural, and technical levels, and we cannot carry out production effectively. Some of our labor models are engaged in production from morning to night and have no time to learn. If this continues, labor models will not be able to progress quickly and will not be able to play a model role in production. Therefore, I believe we must attach importance to learning, and relevant leaders should also pay attention to our learning problems.

    希望有关部门解决工人干部的学习问题
    编辑同志：“三反”运动后，我们工厂提拔了大批工人干部。工人干部的文化水平很低，业务能力也需要提高，因此迫切需要学习。我希望有关部门帮助我们解决这个问题。第一，我们希望赶快成立训练班，让工人干部轮流学习；第二，精简不必要的会议，使工人干部能够在业余时间学习；第三，希望报纸多多介绍工人干部怎样管理工厂的经验。

    编辑同志：我是苏北扬州振扬电厂的劳动模范。我认为我们只搞生产而不学习，是不对的。不学习，就不能提高政治、文化和技术水平，就不能很好地进行生产。我们有些劳动模范，从早到晚搞生产，没时间学习。这样下去，劳动模范就不能很快地进步，不能在生产上起模范作用。所以我认为我们要重视学习，有关领导方面也应该注意我们的学习问题。    工业劳动模范    张柏芳
