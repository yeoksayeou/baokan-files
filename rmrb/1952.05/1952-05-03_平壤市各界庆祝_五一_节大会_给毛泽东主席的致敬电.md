    Pyongyang City Celebrates May Day Rally
    Message of Salute to Chairman Mao Zedong
    To the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, who sincerely assists the Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War!

    On the occasion of welcoming the "May Day" festival, which reviews and demonstrates the international unity and combat power of the working people of the world, we would like to extend our warm congratulations and respect to you, our beloved, and through you to all the Chinese people.

    Today, together with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, we continue to inflict heavy blows on the common enemy of the people of Korea and China—the American imperialist armed aggressors. We celebrate "May Day" in a victorious environment, safeguarding the freedom, independence, and honor of our motherland. We will never forget the kindness of the nearly 500 million Chinese people under your leadership who sent their brave volunteers to directly assist us during the most critical period of our Fatherland Liberation War. We will forever remember the noble blood shed and the immortal feats established by the commanders and fighters of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers on our land.

    In the just struggle against the common enemy—the American imperialist armed aggressors—the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, forged with blood, has become a model of the iron-like internationalist unity of the working people of the world. We believe that this friendship and unity between our two peoples will be further consolidated in the international democratic camp led by the great Stalin.

    Today, the American imperialist armed aggressors, who have suffered repeated defeats in the face of the heroic struggle of the people of Korea and China, are not only continuing to drag out the armistice negotiations in order to realize their aggressive ambitions, but are also perpetrating the bestial atrocities of germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China. However, the people of Korea and China, who are receiving the warm support of the peace-loving people of the world headed by the great Soviet people, will surely crush any conspiracy of the American aggressors and will surely achieve final victory. For the further consolidation of the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, and for the peace and happiness of the great Chinese people, we wish you boundless longevity.

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Korea and China!

    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, who sincerely assists our Fatherland Liberation War!

    平壤市各界庆祝“五一”节大会
    给毛泽东主席的致敬电
    伟大的中国人民领袖、诚挚地援助着朝鲜人民的正义的祖国解放战争的毛泽东主席！
    在迎接检阅和显示全世界劳动人民的国际团结和战斗威力的“五一”节之际，我们谨向敬爱的您并通过您向全中国人民致以热烈的祝贺和敬意。
    今天，我们和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军一起，继续给予着朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者以沉重的打击，我们在保卫祖国的自由、独立与荣誉的胜利环境中庆祝“五一”节。我们永远不能忘记，您所领导的近五万万的中国人民在我祖国解放战争的最严重时期派出自己勇敢的志愿军直接援助的恩惠，我们永远记忆着兄弟般的中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员在我国疆土上所流下的高贵的鲜血和他们所建立的不朽的功勋。
    在反抗共同敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者的正义斗争中，用鲜血结成的我们朝中两国人民的友谊团结，现已成为全世界劳动人民钢铁般的国际主义团结的榜样。我们相信，我们两国人民的这种友谊团结，在伟大的斯大林所领导的国际民主阵营中，今后必将更加巩固。
    今天在朝中两国人民的英勇斗争面前连遭惨败的美帝国主义武装侵略者，为了实现其侵略野心，不但继续拖延着停战谈判，而且在朝鲜和中国东北地区制造着细菌战争的野兽暴行。但是受着以伟大的苏联人民为首的全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支援的朝中两国人民，一定要粉碎美国侵略者的任何阴谋，定要取得最后的胜利。为了我们朝中两国人民友谊团结的进一步巩固，为了伟大的中国人民的和平幸福，谨祝您万寿无疆。
    朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    中国人民所敬爱的领袖、诚挚地援助着我国解放战争的毛泽东主席万岁！
    平壤市各界庆祝“五一”节大会
    一九五二年四月三十日
