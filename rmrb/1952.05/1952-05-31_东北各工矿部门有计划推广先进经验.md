    Northeast industrial and mining departments are concentrating efforts to promote, in an organized and planned way, several advanced production experiences and advanced working methods that are decisive for the development of production. This is their main method to complete this year's huge production increase and savings plan, according to the instructions of Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government.
    Over the past three years, the working class in Northeast China has actively learned from the Soviet Union and greatly developed its wisdom in the restoration and development of production, creating dozens of important advanced experiences. If these advanced experiences are mastered by all employees, they can greatly promote the production increase and savings campaign and improve the level of industrial production. At present, each industrial system is actively working on formulating specific promotion methods.
    The iron and steel industry is preparing to promote advanced experiences such as the "fast material flow method" and "rapid steelmaking." The advanced experience of "rapid steelmaking" is applicable to open-hearth steelmaking. If the smelting time of each furnace of steel is shortened by 30 minutes after promotion, the existing open-hearth equipment in Northeast China can produce 35,000 tons of steel per year. The "fast material flow method" is applicable to blast furnace ironmaking. After the promotion of this advanced operation method, the equipment utilization rate of the blast furnace can be greatly improved, thereby increasing the output of pig iron and reducing the cost of pig iron; at the same time, it can also stabilize the operation of the blast furnace, thereby improving the quality of pig iron and making the composition of pig iron uniform.
    In coal mines, iron mines, and non-ferrous metal mines, the main focus is on promoting advanced experiences to improve the efficiency of coal mining, tunneling, drilling, rock drilling, and well construction, as well as advanced experiences to ensure safe production, such as the "parallel operation method" of the Xi'an Coal Mine, Cui Guoshan's "rapid tunneling method" of the Jixi Coal Mine, Ma Wenzhi's "rapid drilling method" of the Fuxin Coal Mine, the wet rock drilling method of the First Copper Mine of the Northeast Non-ferrous Metal Administration, and the safe production experience of the Shi Yuhai team of the Xi'an Coal Mine. After these advanced experiences are widely promoted, the various tasks of mines and underground will present a brand-new look. For example, after Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling method created by Jixi Coal Mine is promoted in the coal mine system, the labor productivity of tunneling can be doubled, and the abnormal situation that there is often no coal to mine due to the backwardness of tunneling compared to coal mining can be changed. After the promotion of Ma Wenzhi's "rapid drilling method" of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, not only can the drilling efficiency be increased by three times, but also the resource exploration and geological drilling work can be rapidly improved. This advanced experience will have a great impact on the development of ferrous metal, coal, and non-ferrous metal industries. The wet rock drilling method of the First Copper Mine of the Northeast Non-ferrous Metal Administration is an advanced experience that is both beneficial to the health of workers and can improve production efficiency. In the past, the mine used two people to watch a rock drilling machine. After the implementation of this method, workers can now generally operate two to three machines independently, and the rock drilling efficiency of each machine has also increased by about one-quarter. After changing from dry rock drilling to wet rock drilling, workers no longer inhale a large amount of rock powder containing toxins such as silica, and occupational diseases can be basically eliminated.
    In order to meet the needs of increased production in factories and mines and urban lighting, the power industry is actively learning and promoting advanced experiences such as adjusting power load, saving power, "rapid maintenance method," and "planned maintenance." Since the widespread adjustment of power load last November, the power load within the ultra-high voltage grid has become increasingly balanced. By the end of March this year, the power industry system had adjusted more than 30,000 kilowatts of power, which is equivalent to adding 40,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment for the country. After the "rapid maintenance method" is promoted, it is equivalent to adding 10,000 to 20,000 kilowatts of standby power in the high-voltage grid this year. Last year, the power industry system carried out regular "planned maintenance," which increased the power generation capacity by more than 50,000 kilowatts. The experience of thermal power plants using inferior coal (ash content of about 35 percent) produced locally or in nearby mining areas for power generation can not only save more than 300,000 tons of good coal a year, but more importantly, it can make full use of the country's resources.
    In the machinery and electrical appliance industries, in addition to advanced experiences such as "high-speed cutting," "rapid cutting," "multi-tool multi-blade cutting," and "joint teams," an important advanced experience in production management has recently emerged, which is "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts." Combining this advanced experience with advanced experiences such as "high-speed cutting" and "multi-tool multi-blade cutting" can make the production appearance of the machinery and electrical appliance industries completely new. Because after many machine factories used advanced experiences such as "high-speed cutting" and "multi-tool multi-blade cutting," although the efficiency of certain parts and types of work has increased a lot, they still cannot coordinate the production of various departments, which affects the improvement of the overall production efficiency of the factory. The advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" is the main method to solve this problem. After the No. 3 Machine Factory learned this advanced experience, under the original conditions of equipment, workers, and factory buildings, labor efficiency increased by 27 percent, and product quality increased significantly. The factory transitioned from having no first-class products in the past to having first-class products accounting for 67 percent in April, and basically eliminated third-class products. In addition, advanced experiences such as the "labor division specialization" of the No. 5 Electrical Factory and Yang Shou Xun's sand-casting "double-scale modeling method" of the Shenyang Farm Implement Factory, as well as advanced technologies such as ductile iron, are also prepared for widespread promotion in the machinery industry system.
    The paper-making system is preparing to promote the "rapid cooking method" created by the No. 5 Paper Mill and the "separate beating method" on paper copying. The "rapid cooking method" can increase the daily output of pulp from 3.2 vats to 9 vats. After the No. 1 Paper Mill implemented the "beating method" for copying newsprint, it has increased the equipment efficiency of the pulping machine by 77 percent, saving 2,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day, and increased the output and quality of newsprint.
    The rubber industry is preparing to continue to promote the method of the No. 4 Rubber Factory using reclaimed rubber instead of raw rubber. If this advanced experience is widely promoted in the rubber industry, 540 tons of raw rubber can be saved from May to December, which can make more than 4 million pairs of rubber shoes. Products made with reclaimed rubber can also guarantee quality, while the cost can be greatly reduced.
    The textile system mainly promotes the Hao Jianxiu work method and the "1951 weaving work method." Under the current situation of insufficient textile equipment and continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the promotion of these two experiences can increase the output of the Northeast textile system by more than 2,200 pieces of yarn and more than 360,000 bolts of cloth per year.
    In the food industry, the "Li Chuanjiang oil extraction method" will be widely promoted (this is an advanced experience created by Li Chuanjiang, a worker at the public-owned Shengli Factory in Siping City, Liaoxi Province). It scientifically improved the temperature, humidity, pressing time, and pressure of soybean flakes, increasing the oil yield per 100 jin of soybeans to 14.004 jin. According to the calculation of one province in Liaoxi, if this advanced experience is widely promoted in the oil industry throughout the province, it can increase the production of soybean oil by 40,000 jin per day.
    In the basic construction sector, the Su Changyou bricklaying method, the Xie Wanfu carpentry assembly line operation method, the Yang Dezhong plastering assembly line operation method, and the Yu Donghai grouting assembly line operation method will be vigorously promoted. The basic construction departments of Shenyang, Harbin, Anshan, Changchun, and other cities are preparing to train 1,040 Su Changyou-style advanced teams within two months and widely promote the above-mentioned advanced experiences in new construction projects throughout the city. Qiqihar City plans to have more than 20 percent of the city's technicians use advanced working methods within two months. These will have a great effect on ensuring the completion of this year's heavy basic construction tasks.
    The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government, and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions attach great importance to the various advanced experiences that have emerged in the above-mentioned types of industries and have called on departments with similar business natures to fully promote them. Various factories and mines are now formulating plans to promote advanced experiences; some have also established organizational structures to promote advanced experiences and revised reward regulations. Many factories and mines are organizing employees to learn and apply advanced experiences and advanced operating methods suitable for their units according to their own production conditions. A widespread upsurge in promoting advanced experiences is gradually forming, and this movement will greatly enrich and develop various advanced experiences and further improve the technical level of industry.

    东北各工矿部门有计划推广先进经验
    东北各工矿部门正在集中力量，有组织有计划地推广若干种对发展生产有决定意义的先进生产经验和先进工作方法。这是他们根据东北人民政府高岗主席的指示，用来完成今年巨大增产节约计划的主要办法。
    三年来，东北工人阶级在恢复和发展生产中，积极向苏联学习，并高度发挥智慧，创造了数十种重要的先进经验。这些先进经验如果为全体职工所掌握，就可以大大地推动增产节约运动，提高工业生产水平。目前各产业系统都在积极地着手拟订具体的推广办法。
    钢铁工业正准备推广“快料顺行法”、“快速炼钢”等先进经验。“快速炼钢”的先进经验适用于平炉炼钢，推广后，如以每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短三十分钟计，则按照东北现有的平炉设备，一年就能多产三万五千吨钢。“快料顺行法”适用于高炉炼铁。这项先进操作方法推广后，可使高炉的设备利用率大大提高，从而增加生铁的产量，降低生铁的成本；同时，还可以使高炉的操作情况稳定，从而提高生铁的质量，使生铁的成分均匀。
    在煤矿、铁矿和有色金属的矿山中，主要是推广提高采煤、掘进、钻探、凿岩、建井等效率的先进经验和保证安全生产的先进经验，如西安煤矿的“平行作业法”、鸡西煤矿的崔国山“快速掘进法”、阜新煤矿的马文志“快速钻探法”、东北有色金属管理局第一铜矿的湿式凿岩法和西安煤矿的施玉海小组安全生产经验等。这些先进经验普遍推广后，矿山和井下的各项工作就会出现崭新的面貌。例如鸡西煤矿崔国山所创造的快速掘进法在煤矿系统推广后，掘进的劳动生产率就可以提高一倍，并且可以改变长期存在着的由于掘进落后于采煤而经常发生的无煤可采的不正常情况。阜新矿务局马文志“快速钻探法”的先进经验推行后，不仅能使钻探效率提高三倍，并且能使资源勘察工作和地质钻探工作迅速得到改善。这一先进经验对于黑色金属、煤炭和有色金属等工业的发展将起极大的影响。东北有色金属管理局第一铜矿的湿式凿岩法，是既有利于工人健康，又能提高生产效率的先进经验。该矿过去都是两个人看一台凿岩机，推行这种方法后，现在一般工人都能单独操纵两台到三台，每台机器的凿岩效率也提高了四分之一左右，由干式凿岩法改为湿式凿岩法后，工人不再吸入大量含有二氧化矽等毒素的岩粉，职业病可以基本消灭。
    电业系统为了满足工厂、矿山的增产和城市照明的需要，正积极学习和推广调整电力负荷，节约电力、“快速检修法”，“计划检修”等先进经验。自去年十一月普遍进行调整电力负荷以来，超高压网内之电力负荷已日趋平衡。到今年三月底止，电业系统已调整出三万多瓩的电力，等于为国家增加了四万瓩的发电设备。“快速检修法”推广后，等于今年在高压网内增加一万到两万瓩的备用电源。去年电业系统进行了定期的“计划检修”，提高了发电能力五万多瓩。火力发电厂利用当地或邻近矿区所产劣煤（灰分在百分之三十五左右）发电的经验推广后不但一年可以节省三十万吨以上的好煤，更重要的是使国家的资源得到充分的利用。
    在机械和电器工业中，除了“高速切削”、“快速切削”、“多刀多刃切削”和“联合小组”等先进经验外，最近又出现了一项重要的生产管理上的先进经验，就是“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”。把这一先进经验与“高速切削”、“多刀多刃切削”等先进经验结合起来，就可使机械和电器工业的生产面貌焕然一新。因为许多机器工厂运用了“高速切削”和“多刀多刃切削”等先进经验后，虽然某些部件和工种的效率提高很多，但还不能使各种部门生产协调起来，以致影响了全厂的生产效率的提高。“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进经验，就是解决这一问题的主要方法。机器三厂学习这一先进经验后，在原有的设备、工人和厂房等条件下，劳动效率提高了百分之二十七，产品质量显著上升，由过去没有一级品而转为四月份一级品占百分之六十七，并基本上消灭了三级品。此外，电工五厂的“劳动分工专业化”、沈阳农具一厂杨守训翻砂“双称造型法”等先进经验和球墨铸铁等先进技术，也准备在机械工业系统中普遍推广。
    造纸系统准备推广的是：造纸五厂所创造的“快速蒸煮法”，和抄纸上的“分别叩解法”等。“快速蒸煮法”可使纸浆的日产量由三点二罐提高到九罐。造纸一厂推行了抄新闻纸的“叩解法”以后，已使打浆机的设备效率提高了百分之七十七，每天可节省两千六百个电字的电力，并提高了新闻纸的产量和质量。
    橡胶工业准备继续推广橡胶四厂利用再生胶代替生胶的方法。这一先进经验如在橡胶业中普遍推广，由五月到十二月就能节省生胶五百四十吨，可做四百多万双胶鞋。用再生胶制造的产品，同样能保证质量，而成本则可以大大降低。
    纺织系统主要推广的是郝建秀工作法和“一九五一织布工作法”。在目前纺织设备不足，人民购买力不断提高的情况下，推广这两项经验，东北纺织系统一年可多产两千二百多件纱和三十六万多疋布。
    在食品工业中，将普遍地推广“李川江制油法”（这是辽西省四平市公营胜利工厂工人李川江所创造的先进经验），它科学地改进了豆片子的温度、湿度、压榨时间和压力，使每百斤大豆的出油率提高到十四点零零四斤。据辽西一个省的计算，如全省制油业普遍推广这一先进经验，每天可以增产四万斤豆油。
    在基本建设部门中，将大力推广苏长有砌砖法、谢万福木工流水作业法、杨德重抹灰流水作业法和于东海抅缝流水作业法。沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、长春等市基本建设部门准备在两个月内，培养出一千零四十个苏长有式的先进小组，并在全市新建工程中普遍推广上述先进经验。齐齐哈尔市计划在两个月内，使全市百分之二十以上的技术工人使用先进的工作法操作。这些，对保证今年繁重的基本建设任务的完成，具有极大的作用。
    中共中央东北局、东北人民政府工业部和东北总工会，对于上述各类工业中所涌现的各种先进经验非常重视，已号召同类业务性质的部门全面推广。各厂矿现正纷纷制订推广先进经验的计划；有的并成立了推广先进经验的组织机构，修订了奖励条例。许多厂矿都按照自己的生产条件，组织职工学习和运用适合本单位的先进经验和先进操作方法。一个广泛的推广先进经验的热潮正在逐渐形成，这一运动将大大地丰富和发展各种先进经验，进一步提高工业的技术水平。（新华社）
