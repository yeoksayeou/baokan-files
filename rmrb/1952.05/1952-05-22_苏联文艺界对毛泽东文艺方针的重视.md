    Soviet Literary and Art Circles Value Mao Zedong's Literary and Art Policy
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow Li He
    Recently, Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane," and the "White Haired Girl" written by He Jingzhi and Ding Yi, were awarded the 1951 Stalin Prizes. This, like the Stalin Prizes awarded to a group of Chinese filmmakers last year, not only reflects the international friends' attention to the life and struggle of the Chinese people, but also reflects that Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and the achievements made by the Chinese literary and art circles under the guidance of this glorious line, have been valued by the Soviet literary and art circles.
    Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art ten years ago is well known to Soviet literary and art workers. When introducing Chinese literary and artistic works, and when commenting on Chinese literary and artistic works, they always base their arguments on Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the direction of China's literary and art development. The Chinese literary and artistic works that have been introduced to the Soviet Union and welcomed by the broad masses of Soviet readers are precisely those that correctly understood the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art and served the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Let's cite a few examples here!
    When Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village" was translated and published in Russian in 1949, the translator, V. Krivtsov, wrote in his introduction: "The true inheritor of China's long-standing culture, the Communist Party of China, has always paid great attention to the development of literature and art. As early as May 1942, when the War of Resistance Against Japan was at its fiercest, the Communist Party of China convened a forum on literature and art in the cave dwellings of Yan'an, the capital of the liberated areas. Mao Zedong spoke twice at the meeting. His speech became the battle program for the entire progressive literature of China." Krivtsov introduced the main content of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, and believed that the main achievement of the writer Zhao Shuli "lies in his close connection with the people in his creation, which is exactly what Mao Zedong called on Chinese writers to do."
    Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River" was translated and published in Russian in 1950. The translator, Liu Ba·Pozdneeva, recently said in a radio commentary: This work was created in accordance with the direction of Chinese literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, as instructed by the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong; the author's achievement lies in her expression of the image of the working farmers who are driving the progress of Chinese history under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.
    When the "Collection of Chinese Short Stories" collecting the works of Zhao Shuli, Liu Baiyu, Cao Ming and others was published in 1950, the translator Nie. Baghomov wrote in the introduction: "Mao Zedong's writers' meeting held in Yan'an, the capital of the liberated areas, in 1942 was an important milestone in the history of progressive Chinese literature. At this meeting, the leader of the Chinese people gave clear and detailed answers to the basic questions of developing literature, and he called on writers to create truly people's works."
    Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane" was translated and published in Russian in 1951, and the translator, V. Rudeman, said in the preface: "Modern Chinese literature, which belongs to the people, uses living language, and is understood by the broad masses of Chinese working people, is developing in accordance with the road indicated by Mao Zedong in 1942. These instructions of the leader of the Communist Party of China have opened a new chapter in the history of Chinese literature, which is becoming more and more obvious year by year in the writings of writers such as Zhao Shuli, Liu Baiyu, Zhou Libo, Liu Qing, Cao Ming, and so on."
    "The East is Red" translated by S. Potvennik, collects poems by "The East is Red" and Tian Jian and others. In the postscript to this collection of poems, V. Petrov wrote: "Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party of China, in his historic speech in Yan'an in May 1942, determined the basic tasks of Chinese literature and art: to serve the people, to study the lives of the working masses, and to study the forms of folk creation. The past six or seven years have been a period of unprecedented prosperity in Chinese literature, and this period has added and is adding more and more new forces to the ranks of the cultural army."
    In addition to the above-mentioned, Chinese literary and artistic works that have been translated into the Soviet Union in the past two or three years also include "Prime Mover," "Turbulent Ten Years," "Heroes of the Lüliang Mountains," and "New Children's Heroes," etc. All these works more or less reflect a certain aspect of the struggle and life of the Chinese people, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Chinese films shown in the Soviet Union in the past two years, such as "Liberated China," "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Steel Fighter," and "White Haired Girl," have been welcomed precisely because these films truthfully reflect a certain aspect of the struggle and life of the Chinese people, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Chinese paintings reproduced in Soviet publications are also mostly New Year pictures depicting the labor and life of Chinese workers or peasants.
    The Soviet people welcome the excellent works produced under the brilliant illumination of Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, because only such works can enable them to see the correct image of the life and struggle of the Chinese working people, and only such works can help deepen their understanding of Chinese friends.
    The Soviet people often encourage Chinese literary and artistic works. Soviet readers and audiences eagerly look forward to more and better literary and artistic works that reflect the life and struggle of Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers than they now know, that is, the works produced by Chinese literary and art workers after delving into the life and struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers in accordance with Chairman Mao's literary and art policy. Isn't the Chinese literary workers winning the 1951 Stalin Prize a good illustration of this friendly encouragement and eager expectation?

    苏联文艺界对毛泽东文艺方针的重视
    新华社驻莫斯科记者  李何
    最近丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”、周立波的“暴风骤雨”、贺敬之和丁毅执笔的“白毛女”，得到了一九五一年度斯大林奖金。这和去年我国一批电影工作者得到斯大林奖金一样，除了反映中国人民的生活和斗争受到国际朋友的重视之外，也反映了：毛主席的文艺路线，以及中国文艺界在这一光辉路线的指导下所获得的成就，已受到苏联文艺界的重视。
    毛主席十年前在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，已为苏联文艺工作者所熟知，他们在介绍中国文艺作品时，在评论中国文艺作品时，总是以毛主席这个对中国文艺发展方向的辉煌指示为依据的。而被介绍到苏联来的、并受到苏联广大读者欢迎的中国文学和艺术作品，也正是那些正确地领会了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话的精神，为工农兵服务的作品。这里让我们举出几个例子吧！
    赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”在一九四九年译成俄文出版时，译者维·克里甫佐夫在他的引言中写道：“中国悠久文化的真正继承人——中国共产党，向来非常注意文学和艺术的发展。早在一九四二年五月，当抗日战争进行得最激烈的时候，在解放区首都延安的窑洞里，中国共产党召开了文艺座谈会。毛泽东在会议上讲了两次话。他的讲话成了中国整个进步文学的战斗纲领。”克里甫佐夫介绍了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话的主要内容，并且认为赵树理这位作家的主要功绩“在于他的创作跟人民密切联系，而这正是毛泽东向中国作家所号召的”。
    丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”在一九五○年译成俄文出版。译者刘琶·波兹得涅娃最近在广播评论中说：这个作品是按照中国人民领袖毛泽东所指示的中国文学为工农兵服务的方向创作的；作者的功绩在于她表达了在中国共产党领导下推动中国历史前进的劳动农民的形象。
    收集着赵树理、刘白羽、草明等人的作品的“中国短篇小说集”在一九五○年出版时，译者涅·巴贺莫夫在引言中写道：“毛泽东一九四二年在解放区首都延安召开的作家会议，是进步的中国文学历史上的重要路标。在这次会议上，中国人民领袖对于发展文学的基本问题给了明确的、详尽的回答，他号召作家创造真正人民的作品。”
    周立波的“暴风骤雨”在一九五一年译成俄文出版，译者维·鲁得曼在序言中说：“属于人民的、使用着活的语言的、为中国广大劳动群众所了解的现代中国文学，是依照毛泽东在一九四二年指示的道路发展的。中国共产党领袖的这些指示，在中国文学历史上开辟了新的一章，一年年越来越明显地表现在像赵树理、刘白羽、周立波、柳青、草明等等作家的著作中。”
    斯·波特文尼克译的“东方红”，收集有“东方红”和田间等人的诗篇。在这本诗集的后记中，维·彼特罗夫写道：“中国共产党领袖毛泽东同志一九四二年五月在延安的有历史意义的讲话中，确定了中国文学和艺术的基本任务：为人民服务，研究劳动群众的生活，研究民间创作的形式。最近六、七年来是中国文学空前繁荣的时期，这个时期在文化军队的队伍中添加了和添加着更多更多的新的力量。”
    最近两三年被翻译到苏联来的中国文艺作品，除了上述的以外，还有“原动力”、“动荡的十年”、“吕梁英雄传”、“新儿女英雄传”等，所有这些作品都或多或少地反映了中国人民首先是工农兵的斗争和生活的某一面。两年来在苏联演出的中国影片，如“解放了的中国”、“中国人民的胜利”、
    “钢铁战士”、“白毛女”等之所以受到欢迎，也正是由于这些影片真实地反映了中国人民首先是工农兵的斗争和生活的某一面。中国的图画被转载在苏联刊物上的，也多是那些描写中国工人或农民劳动和生活的年画。
    苏联人欢迎在毛主席文艺方针的光辉照耀下所产生的优秀作品，因为只有这种作品才能使他们看到中国劳动人民生活和斗争的正确形象，只有这种作品才有助于加深他们对中国朋友的认识。
    苏联人对中国的文学和艺术作品常常加以鼓励。苏联读者和观众殷切地期待着比他们现在所知道的更多更好的、反映中国工农兵生活和斗争的文学和艺术作品，也就是中国文学和艺术工作者依照毛主席文艺方针深入到工农兵生活和斗争中去之后而产生的作品。中国文学工作者荣获一九五一年度斯大林奖金，不正是这种友好的鼓励和殷切的期望的很好说明吗？
