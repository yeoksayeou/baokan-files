    The Qiancheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Should Examine its Leadership Style

    Editor: Qiancheng County, Hunan Province, is an area where the Miao ethnic group constitutes the absolute majority. The Qiancheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has not done enough to promote and cultivate local ethnic minority cadres. However, it promotes southbound cadres without any principle. It was not until the first Party Representative Conference of the Xiangxi District that the county party committee was criticized by higher authorities, and only then did changes begin to occur. But in other aspects, there are still many problems, such as disunity among the cadres of the county committee, and some individual organs being extremely unserious about the work of developing party members, etc.

    The county committee is extremely lacking in democratic style. Liu Mingru from Qiancheng's Third District wrote a piece criticizing the Third District Chief Liu Kunshan for having the style of a local tyrant, and was severely criticized by Chen Yulou, the county party secretary. Chen Yulou also said at an enlarged meeting of county committee cadres: "This kind of unorganized and undisciplined erroneous behavior must be resolutely prohibited." Later, when a comrade wrote a "work opinion," he slammed the table and cursed, and sent someone to check the handwriting in order to give punishment.

    I believe that these phenomena should be corrected. I sincerely write this letter, hoping that the higher authorities will investigate and deal with it. A Reader

    中共乾城县委应检查领导作风
    编辑同志：湖南乾城县是苗族占绝对多数的地区，中共乾城县委对当地兄弟民族干部的提拔和培养工作作得不够。但对南下干部则毫无原则地提拔。直到湘西区开第一次党代表会时，县委受到上级的批评，才开始有了改变。但在其他方面，还有很多问题，如县委会干部之间闹不团结，个别机关对发展党员的工作极不严肃，等等。
    该县县委极端缺乏民主作风。乾城三区刘名如写了一篇批评三区区长刘崑山有恶霸作风的稿子，就被县委书记陈玉楼狠狠地批评了一顿。陈玉楼并在县委干部扩大会上说：“必须坚决禁止这种无组织无纪律的错误行为。”后来有一个同志写了一份“工作意见”，他看了以后竟拍案大骂，并派人查对笔迹，要给处分。
    我认为，这些现象都是应该纠正的，我热诚地写这封信，希望上级调查处理。    一读者
