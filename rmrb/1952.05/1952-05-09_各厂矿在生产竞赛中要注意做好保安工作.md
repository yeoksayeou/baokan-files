    Factories and Mines Should Pay Attention to Security Work During Production Competitions
    Editor: The Wangjiayuan Coal Mine Shihmen Steel Team of Pingxiang Coal Mine, famous throughout the country, had a work-related injury accident on April 27th. This team had created a national record of 27.85 meters of Shihmen tunneling on April 21st. The workers' enthusiasm for production was high, but they only remembered creating new records and neglected production safety. On the afternoon of April 27th, when worker Shen Songnan was detonating explosives, he did not check whether worker Gao Changfu had come out of the mine. As a result, Gao Changfu had not yet come out of the mine when the explosives went off, and Gao Changfu was seriously injured.
    This is a bloody lesson. Leading cadres of factories and mines must absorb this lesson, vigorously promote the ideological education of "safety first" to workers, and earnestly do security work. After the end of the "Three-Anti" movement, factories, mines, and enterprises across the country are about to launch a large-scale production competition movement. Therefore, leading cadres should strengthen safety education for workers and formulate specific security systems. Otherwise, if various accidents occur while creating new records, this will hinder the progress of the production increase and conservation movement. This is a problem worthy of attention.

### 各厂矿在生产竞赛中要注意做好保安工作

    各厂矿在生产竞赛中要注意做好保安工作
    编辑同志：全国闻名的萍乡煤矿王家源矿石门钢铁队，四月二十七日发生一次工伤事故。这个队曾在四月二十一日创造了石门掘进二十七点八五公尺的全国纪录。全队工人生产热情是高了，但只记着创造新纪录，却忽略了生产安全。二十七日下午，工人沈松南点炮时，没有照顾工人高昌富是否已经从矿里出来，就去点炮。结果，高昌富还没有从矿里出来，炮响了，高昌富负了重伤。
    这是一次血的教训。厂矿领导干部要吸收这个教训，向工人大力宣传贯彻“安全第一”的思想教育，并认真作好保安工作。“三反”运动结束后，全国各地厂、矿、企业即将开展大规模的生产竞赛运动。因此，领导干部应当加强对工人进行安全教育，订出具体的保安制度。否则创造新纪录的时候，发生各种事故，这会障碍增产节约运动前进的。这是一个值得注意的问题。    陈皓辉
