American Air Robbers Severely Punished
    You Zai

    On May 8th, in a certain area of Korea, the commanders and fighters of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit of our volunteer army fought a day-long battle, creating a brilliant record of destroying or damaging twenty-seven enemy aircraft.

    The Korean morning is exceptionally beautiful. The sun's soft golden light awakens the slumbering villages, and birds sing freely in the azure sky. On the verdant hillsides, Korean women in white clothes and black skirts greet this wonderful time with joyous labor.

    It was on such a peaceful and serene morning that the devilish roar of enemy aircraft suddenly echoed from the distant sky. The sound grew closer, and people watched the sky with anger.

    The telephone rang at our anti-aircraft artillery position. An order came from the command post: "Prepare for battle!"

    The position immediately erupted in activity:
    "This is our chance to do meritorious service for the people of our motherland!"
    "Let them come! One plane comes, we shoot down one; two planes come, we shoot down a pair!"
    "The American devils are invading Korea, saying they want to eat apples; come on, we have plenty of apples (referring to anti-aircraft shells)! We'll make sure they can eat them, but can't get them out!"

    The enemy planes gradually approached. The first batch of thirty-six planes were arranged in three rows, with a command helicopter ascending in the middle.

    "Aim at the second plane!" the commander issued the order.

    The observers were busy reporting distances, and the gunners were adjusting angles...

    As soon as the enemy planes approached, they began to dive frantically, pouring batches of bombs onto the peaceful villages.

    "Fire!" the commander shouted angrily: "Fire! Fire! Fire! Hit them hard!"

    The battle unfolded fiercely. The enemy planes charged down like mad dogs; our brave gunners concentrated their firepower, aiming at the enemy planes and attacking them fiercely. White smoke rings wove a web of fire around the enemy planes. In an instant, the sky and the ground were filled with roaring explosions, and thick smoke, like a wall, almost blocked people's view.

    "Boom!" A huge cracking sound erupted in the sky. An enemy plane, just about to dive, was hit, caught fire, and exploded.

    "Hit well! Hit well! Keep hitting them hard!" The commander excitedly reported the first victory. The gunners' hearts were filled with joy.

    The first batch of enemy planes, after paying a heavy price (one shot down, three damaged), scurried away like startled birds.

    Enthusiastic cheers of victory rose from the position.

    The telephone rang again. The command post issued another order: "Prepare to continue the battle! Fight calmly and resolutely!"

    Indeed, enemy planes came one after another, and the battle became increasingly fierce. The enemy planes, having suffered painful punishment, launched retaliatory attacks on the position in large formations. But the more frantic the enemy planes became, the higher the gunners' morale soared, and they shouted excitedly: "Fight well! Win honor for the people of our motherland!"

    The steel-willed commanders and fighters defended the steel position. As enemy planes rushed frantically towards the position one after another, the commander immediately issued an order to shift the position. Just as the third gun was being pulled out of the position, a bomb exploded on that very spot! The gunners looked at the commander's calm and resolute face with eyes full of admiration and gratitude, and shouted in unison: "With such a wise commander, we are guaranteed to win a beautiful victory!" Ding Cheng, the squad leader of the second machine gun squad and a Communist Party member, was observing the position outside the bunker. When the enemy planes dived down, he calmly waved his arms and directed the battle outside the fortifications. Liu Zhixin, the squad leader of the fourth squad, had his left ear injured by shrapnel, and blood flowed profusely. But he continued to direct the battle. A fire bomb exploded on the small slope behind the first squad's position, and the camouflage and gun cover on the gun caught fire, and the squad leader was also injured; Zhang Zhide, the second gunner, took the lead in putting out the fire and continued to fight. Zhao Jing, the third gunner, had his left arm broken by shrapnel. As the nurses, braving the hail of bullets, carried him onto a stretcher, he raised his right arm and encouraged his comrades: "Comrades, don't worry about me, keep fighting hard! To defeat American imperialism, victory doesn't come without a price!"

    "Avenge our comrades!" The hearts of the gunners and machine gunners were burning like fire. The gunners cooperated closely, giving full play to their initiative, and continued to inflict effective blows on the frantically invading enemy planes. Wu Zhiguo, the third gunner, took the initiative to correct the speed, and two shells hit two enemy planes; Wu Anping, the fourth gunner, took the initiative to correct the angle of elevation, and immediately hit another one. "Hit well, hit wonderfully, hit perfectly!" They repelled twenty-one consecutive attacks by enemy planes in this way.

    The battle raged fiercely. Seeing that the shells were running low, Xiong Jizhou, the cultural instructor and member of the Communist Youth League, automatically requested permission from the commander to carry ammunition. He led three comrades towards the supply station. A gasoline bomb blocked their way, and raging flames rushed towards them. Xiong Jizhou waved his hand: "Comrades! Charge! What do we care about the fire net!" When he carried boxes of shells to the third squad's position, the gunners of the third squad reported the good news to him: "Cultural instructor, we shot down another one!" He said happily: "That's right! You fight well, and I'll guarantee the supply of shells!" Before he finished speaking, he rushed back through the fire net to carry shells. The comrades at the supply station also took the initiative to supply shells to the position. The fiery hearts of the soldiers were all burning with one will: to severely punish the American air robbers!

    The gunners and machine gunners fought more and more stubbornly, and the atmosphere on the position became more and more lively. During the intervals in the battle, the soldiers joyfully exclaimed about their brilliant results:

    "We really had a good fight today, giving the American devils a good beating!"

    "That's right! Today, the American devils really got their fill of our 'apples'!"

    "The American devils are lowly scum, they only respect toughness; you see, the first few batches of enemy planes were so rampant, but after we gave them a beating, the later enemy planes didn't dare to fly low, and just threw their bombs randomly on the hillside!"

    "The American devils dropped a lot of bombs today, but what did they hit? They just bombed the already bombed bomb craters again!"

    Even in such a fierce battle, the soldiers valued the property of the people of the motherland more than their own lives. The gunners put forward a firm slogan: "Don't fire unless you can aim accurately! Fire in bursts! Guarantee not to waste a single shell from the people of the motherland!" "We will build a blockade line in the sky and resolutely defeat the enemy planes' key bombing!" When a bomb exploded near the position, Wang Guangxue, a member of the Communist Youth League, used his entire body to protect the rangefinder; flying stones hit his back like rain, but he didn't move. He said: "I would rather be injured than let the rangefinder entrusted to me by the people of the motherland be damaged!" Beside the eighth squad's position, a truck loaded with gasoline was set on fire by the burning liquid of an incendiary bomb. As soon as the enemy planes had passed overhead, the soldiers jumped out of the position to put out the burning flames, rescued the truck, and dispersed the gasoline. They said: "This is the blood and sweat of the people of the motherland, how can we watch it be burned!"

    …………

    After thirteen hours, the battle ended victoriously. The sun finally reappeared. It shone on the position with brilliant light.

    At this time, the commanders came to each position. The soldiers jumped up to greet their commanders. The commanders, seeing these vigorous soldiers, could not hide the joy in their hearts, and they warmly comforted the soldiers: "You've fought for so long! Comrades, you've worked hard! Today we fought a really beautiful battle!"

    The leader stood on the position and solemnly announced the brilliant achievements: "Comrades! Today we repelled the frantic attack of twenty-eight batches of enemy planes (a total of two hundred and ninety-two sorties), shot down nine enemy planes, and damaged eighteen enemy planes, creating an unprecedented record of destroying or damaging enemy planes with the same firepower on the Korean battlefield in a single day! (Applause lasted a long time) Comrades! We must guard against arrogance and rashness, continue to work hard, and strive for greater victories for the people of the motherland!"

    With a burst of warm applause, a majestic song rose from the position:

    The artillery fire shakes our hearts,
    Victory inspires us,
    The Chinese and Korean people are as close as brothers,
    Fighting side by side to strike the enemy………

    美国空中强盗受到了严惩
    尤在
    五月八日，在朝鲜某地，我志愿军某高射炮部队的指战员同志们，进行了一整天的战斗，创造了毁伤敌机二十七架的辉煌纪录。
    朝鲜的清晨是十分美丽的。太阳柔和的金光唤醒了酣睡的村庄，鸟儿在蔚蓝的天空中纵情歌唱。在青翠的山岗上，穿着白衣黑裙的朝鲜妇女们，用欢乐的劳动迎接这美妙的时光。
    就在这样和平宁静的清晨，远方的天空突然传来了魔鬼般的敌机的吼叫声。这声音由远而近，人们愤怒地望着天空。
    我高射炮阵地上的电话铃响了。从指挥所里发来了命令：“准备战斗！”
    阵地上立刻沸腾起来了：
    “这是咱们为祖国人民立功的时候啦！”
    “让它来吧，来一架，打一架；来两架，打一双！”
    “美国鬼子侵略朝鲜，说是想吃苹果；来吧，咱们有的是苹果（指高射炮弹）！管叫它吃得进去，拉不出来！”
    敌机逐渐临空。第一批三十六架列成三行，一架直升指挥机飞升在当中。
    “瞄准第二架！”指挥员发出了口令。
    观测手忙着报告距离，炮手们在矫正角度……。
    敌机刚一临空，就开始疯狂地俯冲，把成批的炸弹向和平的村庄倾泻。
    “放！”指挥员愤怒地喊着：“打！打！打！狠狠地打！”
    战斗激烈地展开了。敌机像疯狗一样地向下冲；我们英勇的炮手们集中火力，瞄准敌机猛揍。白色的烟圈在敌机周围织成了一片火网。刹时间，天上地下，到处发出隆隆的巨响，浓烟像一垛墙，几乎遮断了人们的视线。
    “轰！”天空发出巨大的破裂声。一架刚要向下俯冲的敌机，被击中起火爆炸了。
    “打得好！打得好！使劲地打！”指挥员兴奋地报告着第一个胜利。炮手们的心中乐开了花。
    第一批敌机在付出了惨重的代价后（被击落一架，击伤三架），像惊弓之鸟一样地溜跑了。
    阵地上扬起了热烈的胜利的欢呼。
    电话铃又响了。指挥所又传来命令：“准备继续战斗！沉着地打，坚决地打！”
    果然，敌机一批接着一批不断地袭来，战斗愈来愈激烈了。遭受痛惩的敌机成群结队地向阵地进行报复性的冲击。但是敌机愈疯狂，炮手们的斗志愈高涨，他们兴奋地喊着：“好好地打呀！为祖国人民争光！”
    钢铁的指战员们保卫着钢铁的阵地。敌机一架连一架地向着阵地疯狂地扑来，指挥员立刻发布命令转移阵地。当三炮刚拖出阵地，一颗炸弹就在那阵地上爆炸了！炮手们用充满了敬佩和感激的目光望着指挥员沉着坚毅的脸孔，异口同声地喊道：“有这样英明的指挥，咱们保证打漂亮的胜仗！”机枪二班班长、共产党员丁成，在掩体外面察看阵地。当敌机俯冲下来的时候，他沉着地挥动双臂就在工事外面指挥着战斗。四班班长刘志新的左耳朵被弹片打伤，鲜血直流。但他仍然继续坚持指挥战斗。一颗燃烧弹在一班阵地后面的小坡上爆炸了，炮上的伪装与炮衣都着了火，班长也负了伤；二炮手张志德带头扑灭烈火，又继续坚持战斗。三炮手赵镜的左臂被弹片打断了。当冒着枪林弹雨来抢救他的护士们把他抬上担架时，他还举起右臂鼓舞着他的战友们：“同志们，不用为我担心，使劲地打呀！要打击美帝国主义，没有代价是换不来胜利的！”
    “为同志们复仇！”炮手们、机枪手们的心像火一样地燃烧着。炮手们密切配合，充分发挥了主动性，继续给予疯狂进犯的敌机以有效的打击。三炮手吴治国主动修正航速，两发炮弹就命中两架敌机；四炮手伍安平主动修正升降角，紧接着又打中一架。“打得好，打得妙，打得呱呱叫！”他们就这样地击退了二十一批敌机的连续进攻。
    战斗火热地进行着。眼看炮弹已不够使用了。文化教员、青年团员熊纪周自动向指挥员请求去搬运弹药。他带着三个同志奔向兵站。一颗汽油弹拦断了他们的去路，熊熊的烈火向他们迎面扑来。熊纪周把手一挥：“同志们！冲啊，火网算什么！”当他把成箱的炮弹背到三班阵地时，三班的炮手们向他报喜：“文化教员，又打落了一架！”他高兴地说：“对！你们好好打，我保证供应炮弹！”话还没有说完，他又冲过火网背炮弹去了。兵站的同志们这时也主动地向阵地供应炮弹。战士们火热的心里都燃烧着一个意志：狠狠地打击美国空中强盗呵！
    炮手们、机枪手们愈打愈顽强，阵地上的空气也愈来愈活跃。在战斗的间隙，战士们为了自己的辉煌战果而欢跃地嚷开了：
    “咱们今天可打得痛快，狠狠地揍了美国鬼子一顿！”
    “对呀！今天美国鬼子可吃饱了咱们的‘苹果’了！”
    “美国鬼子是贱种，他只服硬；你看，头几批敌机多撒野呀，经不住咱们一顿揍，后来的敌机可就不敢低飞了，把炸弹乱扔在山坡上！”
    “今天美国鬼子扔的炸弹可不少，他炸着了什么呢？还不是把已经炸烂的弹坑再炸一次！”
    就在这样激烈的战斗中，战士们还是把祖国人民的财产看得比他们的生命还要珍贵。炮手们提出了坚决的口号：“瞄不准不打！点发！保证不浪费祖国人民的一颗炮弹！”“我们要把阻击战线筑上天空，坚决打败敌机的重点轰炸！”青年团员王广学，当炸弹在阵地近旁爆炸时，他用自己的整个身体掩护着测远机；横飞的石块像雨一样地打在他的背上，他动也不动。他说：“宁可我受伤，也不能让祖国人民交给我的测远机损坏呵！”在八班阵地旁，一辆满载汽油的汽车。被烧夷弹的烧液烧着了。当敌机刚从头上掠过，战士们就跳出阵地扑灭了燃烧的火焰，抢救了汽车，又分散了汽油。他们说：“这是祖国人民的血汗，我们怎能看着它被烧掉哩！”
    …………
    历时十三小时之后，战斗胜利的结束了。太阳这时才重新露出头来。它用灿烂的光辉照耀着阵地。
    这时，指挥员都分别到各阵地上来了。战士们跳起来迎接自己的指挥员。指挥员们看见这一个个生龙活虎般的战士，也掩不住自己内心的愉快，他们亲切地慰问着战士们：“打了这样久！同志们辛苦了！今天咱们的仗打得真漂亮呀！”
    首长站在阵地上庄严地宣布辉煌的战绩：“同志们！今天我们击退了敌机二十八批（共二百九十二架次）的猖狂进攻，击落了敌机九架，击伤了敌机十八架，创造了在朝鲜战场上，在一天一地以同样的火力毁伤敌机的空前纪录。（掌声历久不息）同志们！我们要戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，为祖国人民争取更大的胜利！”
    随着一阵热烈的掌声，阵地上扬起了雄壮的歌声：
    炮火震动着我们的心，
    胜利鼓舞着我们，
    中朝人民亲如兄弟，
    并肩作战打击敌人………
