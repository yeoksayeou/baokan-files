The evening artillery fire grew more intense. Several gasoline lamps lit up in the company command post. Comrades from the Beijing Film Studio were about to start filming, and many guests from afar arrived at the evening party.

They were the young male and female comrades from the cultural troupe, some from the division headquarters, some from the army headquarters, and even some from the Volunteer Army headquarters. Judging from the map, they didn’t live too far away. However, with so many artillery blockade lines and their young age, their arrival was even more sensational. The little soldier with two braids, wearing a cotton-padded coat like an overcoat, had rosy cheeks. The last time they came to offer comfort during the New Year, some soldiers said:

“These young comrades should go back to the motherland to study; we’ll take care of everything on the battlefield.”

But they had a different view: "We can't fight, but can't we sing songs, read newspapers, or weave straw mats for the soldiers? Everyone insists on resisting America and aiding Korea to the end. I won't go back to the country first!"

This time, when they went to the front line again, it was like old comrades suddenly meeting. As soon as they entered the bunker, everyone gathered around.

"The army leaders sent good things! New playing cards, one deck for each platoon; Chinese chess and checkers, one set for each squad; all just bought from the motherland."

There was also a phonograph, brought by the regiment. Two comrades, one carrying the box and the other carrying the records, were prepared to play for each company for a whole night, all the way to the front-line squads.

Commander Peng's Spring Festival greeting cards were also brought.

In the sky above the position, the enemy's searchlight beams were buried in the snow and fog, moving listlessly.

At the front of the position, the two small hilltops covered in thick smoke turned into red-glowing fireballs at night. These were small hills at the foot of the enemy's mountain positions, recaptured more than two months ago, standing proudly face to face with the enemy, less than a hundred steps apart. Now, they were also holding an evening party there.

Red lanterns were hung in the Second Company command post, making the political instructor so happy that he hugged the photographer and said:

"Be sure to film our evening party well, so that the whole world can see our position and our joyful spirit during the New Year."

At the evening party, the soldiers' programs were diverse and outstanding. They composed clapperditties, sang ballads, performed short plays, and showed shadow plays, everywhere filled with the joy of victory and deep frontline emotion.

The cultural troupe members had only performed a few segments at the Sixth Company when a deputy platoon leader, a former soldier, composed a new one:

"Clap the bamboo clappers, ringing continuously, army leaders sent a delegation to offer comfort. They perform plays and send New Year greetings, giving us playing cards to play with; and also a pack of 'Beiling' cigarettes..."

Beiling is a famous scenic spot in Shenyang, the motherland. They had been there during the Northeast Liberation War, making the song even more intimate:

"This cigarette is not simple,
From the motherland, to Korea;
Landed on the banks of the Yalu River,
Transported by train and truck..."

"Crossing great ridges, climbing great mountains, great rivers and great rivers together,
The Da Ning River, the Chongchon River, the Taedong River to the Imjin River,
Keeping the drivers busy...

From the motherland, to the front,
Army leaders don't smoke them, they give them to us,
This heart is not simple!
Comrades smoke them with joy,
Chatting in the bomb shelter:
'What should we use to repay the army leaders?'
This one says, that one speaks:
'Repay the army leaders, it's not difficult,
Dig good bunkers, polish our guns,
Resolutely fight a good defensive battle,
When the devils come, we'll fight them!
Submachine guns, revolver guns, light machine guns to heavy machine guns,
As soon as the hand grenade explodes, everyone opens fire,
Hitting the American devils so hard that they are disoriented, missing arms and legs, rolling down the mountain while muttering gibberish,
Repaying the 500 million people of the motherland!'"...

He was radiant, singing more and more vigorously. Everyone listened, forgetting to applaud, and he sang more and more without end:

"500 million, not simple,
Rice, wheat flour, biscuits, and canned food piled up like mountains,
Ham and pressed duck sent to the front,
And also donating planes, artillery, and tanks to support us!"...

The evening party became more and more wonderful, and the artillery fire became more and more dense. Just as we were about to return to the company command post, a volley of shrapnel fell into the ditch in front of the bunker entrance.

"The enemy is afraid we're not lively enough," the deputy company commander turned around and said, "They're putting firecrackers at the front door. Let's go through the back door!"

He led the way with a flashlight, climbing a section of wooden ladder, and raised his hand to knock on the top board:

"Open up, someone's here!"

A well-sized patch of light appeared at the top. We climbed up the ladder—sure enough, we were at the bedside of the company command post! The deputy company commander covered the well opening, spread a burlap sack, set up a table made of canned food crates, and enthusiastically pulled the guests from afar to play cards:

"Just play all night! Here, we're not afraid of airplanes and artillery coming to blow the reveille; the enemy can't control us sleeping during the day. Wake up and hear good news."

Sure enough, the phone brought good news from the forward position at dawn: "The old Americans sent another batch of gifts—twenty-odd dead, one alive."

This was what happened at ten o'clock the night before. The recoilless rifle platoon's mobile sentry fought an excellent small ambush.

There were eight of them in total. The deputy platoon leader who led them said: "Everyone's having a lively evening party. We also have to present a program: capture a prisoner!"

Capturing prisoners is difficult on the position. But as the enemy's artillery fire became tighter, they had confidence:

"We're celebrating the festival, the old Americans will definitely come to make trouble. We can't refuse gifts sent to our door!"

But whose door would the enemy send gifts to?

The weather was extremely cold, and there was no path to follow in the buffer zone. They also had to follow the enemy in the dark, and they couldn't scare away the gift-givers—this program was very difficult to rehearse. The enemy's position was right in front. If they weren't careful, they would get a bombardment instead. They waded through the frozen river, stood in the wind in the snow, and dared not stomp their feet even when their runny noses froze into icicles, only wiggling their toes in their shoes.

At ten o'clock, the enemy appeared: two platoons of enemies, wading across the river. There must be enemy reinforcements behind them. They couldn't be alarmed. "Let them pass, then hit them on their way back!" The deputy platoon leader divided the team into three groups, leading them back, and halfway through, they found a dark, shiny thing.

Climbing onto the snow: it was an electric wire, not yet covered in snow. It must have been freshly laid by the enemy. The enemy in front must have a telephone. This meant that they wanted to approach our position, organize artillery fire, and launch a sudden attack. The deputy platoon leader bit through two strands and followed the broken wire back, quietly searching.

A burst of dense bullet light suddenly erupted—the front was firing, it was the forward squad's position of the Fifth Company. The Glorious Gun of the artillery regiment was captured there. The enemy's firepower was suppressed, and they sent out a distress flare. This meant that our counter-attack artillery fire had to hit the enemy's rear route immediately. Staying here wasn't a joke, like last time.

A few dark figures appeared in front, and the deputy platoon leader roared:

"Charge! The enemy is in chaos!"

The Fifth Company attacked head-on, and the mobile sentry hit them in the rear, trapping sixty or seventy devils in the middle—how lively! Our artillery fire also bloomed in the enemy's second echelon. By the time the enemy returned fire, the mobile sentry had already run into the trench to hide.

But it was all in vain, and they didn't capture anyone alive. What would they take back as a gift? Group leader Yang Yufang said: "When I hit them on the way back just now, I ran into twenty-odd corpses all the way. How could the enemy die so neatly? It must be the 'playing dead' tactic!"

Sure enough, when he led a group to search, there were only six corpses left along the way.

But he was still not willing to give up, so he groped each one. One was warm and trembling. He raised his gun sharply, and the man sat up, screaming like a pig. Everyone laughed and dragged him back with force.

(The End)

    阵地春节散记
    新华社记者  华山
    黄昏的炮火更加猛烈。连指挥所里亮起好几盏汽灯。北京制片厂的同志正要开始拍电影，晚会上又到了好些远道的客人。
    他们是文工团的男女小同志，有师部的，有军部的，还有志愿军总部的。从地图看，他们住的都不算远。可是炮火封锁线这样多，他们的年纪又这样小，他们的到来就更加轰动了。那个晃着两条小辫子的小军人，身上的棉袄就和大衣那样，脸蛋红通通的。上次过新年他们跑来慰问的时候，就有战士说：
    “小同志都该回祖国学习去，战场上的事情咱们全包了。”
    可是她们的看法不同：“我们不能打仗，还不能给战士们唱唱歌，读读报，编个草帘子？大家都坚持抗美援朝到底，我才不先回国呢！”
    这次他们再上火线，就像老战友突然见面似的，一进洞子大伙就围拢过来。
    “军首长给送来好东西啦！新扑克，一个排一副，军棋象棋，一个班一副；都是刚刚从祖国买来的。”
    还有留声机，这是团里捎来的。两个同志，一个背匣子，一个背唱片，预备每个连给唱一宿，一直唱到前沿班去。
    彭司令员的春节贺片也带来了。
    阵地上空，敌人探照灯的光柱埋在雪雾里，惨稀稀地一动不动。
    阵地的前沿，浓烟盖住的两处小山头在晚上变成了红光迸发的火球。那是在敌人山岳阵地脚下的小山，夺回来已经两个多月，一直和敌人脸对着脸，傲然屹立，相隔不到一百步。现在那里也开着晚会。
    二连指挥所里挂起了红色的花灯，只乐的指导员抱住摄影师说：
    “把咱们的晚会好好拍下来吧，让全世界都看看我们的阵地，看看我们过年的乐劲儿。”
    在晚会上，战士的节目是多样而又出色的，他们编快板，唱鼓词，演短剧，拉洋片，到处都洋溢着胜利的欢乐和深厚的火线感情。
    文工团员刚到第六连演出几段，一个战士出身的副排长又编出新的来了：
    “打竹板，响连环，军首长派来了代表慰问团。又演剧，又拜年，送来扑克给咱玩；还有一条‘北陵’烟。……”
    北陵是祖国沈阳的名胜古迹，他们在东北解放战争中曾经到过，唱起来更加亲切：
    “这条烟，不简单，
    从祖国，到朝鲜；
    鸭绿江边登了岸，
    火车运来汽车搬。”……
    “过大岭，翻大山，大川大河共大江
    大宁江，清川江，大同江来临津江，
    忙坏了司机驾驶员。……
    从祖国，到前方，
    军首长不抽送给咱，
    这片心意不简单！
    同志们抽了心喜欢，
    防炮洞里来漫谈：
    ‘拿什么回答军首长？’
    这个说，那个言：
    ‘回答军首长，不费难，
    挖好洞，擦亮枪，
    坚决打好防御战，
    鬼子一来咱就干！
    冲锋枪，轮盘枪，轻机枪来重机枪，
    手榴弹一响都开了腔，
    打得那美国鬼子蒙头转向，缺胳膊短腿，叽哩咕噜滚下山，
    回答祖国人民五万万！’”……
    他神采飞扬，越唱越来劲，大伙听的都忘了鼓掌，他也越唱越没头了：
    “五万万，不简单，
    大米洋面饼干罐头堆成山，
    火腿板鸭送前方，
    还捐献飞机大炮战车支援咱！”……
    晚会越来越精彩，炮火也越打越密。正要转回连指挥所，一排榴霰弹摔到洞口跟前的沟里。
    “敌人还怕我们不够热闹呢，”副连长转身回来说，“花炮都放到大门口来了。咱们走后门吧！”
    他在头里打着电棒，攀上一截木梯，抬手敲着顶板：
    “开一开，来人啦！”
    头顶露出井口大的一块灯光。我们顺着梯子爬上去，——可不是到了连指挥所的卧铺跟前！副连长盖好井口，铺上麻袋，摆上罐头木箱做的桌子，又兴致勃勃地拉上远道客人打扑克：
    “只管玩个通宵吧！在我们这里，是不怕飞机大炮来吹起床哨的；白天睡大觉敌人也管不着了。醒来再听好消息。”
    果然，电话在黎明传来了前沿阵地的捷报：“老美又送来一批礼物，——二十几个死的，一个活的。”
    这是夜来十点钟的事情。无后座力炮排的游动哨打了一个出色的小小伏击战。
    他们一共八个人。领队的副排长说：“大家开晚会怪热闹的。咱们也得出个节目：抓俘虏！”
    炮手抓俘虏，在阵地上是件困难的事情。可是敌人的炮火越来越紧，他们就有了信心：
    “我们过节，老美一定出来捣蛋。送上门来的礼物可不能不收啊！”
    可是敌人往谁家门口送礼呢？
    天气奇冷，缓冲地带无路可循。又要摸黑跟上敌人，还不能把送礼的吓跑了，——这节目是很不好排演的。敌人的阵地就在跟前。弄不好反而要吃上
    一顿炮。他们摸过冰河，迎风站在雪里，清鼻涕冻成了冰棒也不敢跺跺脚，只在鞋头里活动活动脚趾。
    十点钟，敌人出现了：两个排的敌人，摸过河去。后面一定还有接应的敌人，不能惊动了。“放他们过去，再往回打！”副排长把队伍分成三个小组，领头摸回去，半道上发现一股黑亮的东西。
    爬到雪地上：是电线，还没有沾上雪。准是敌人刚刚拉的。前面的敌人一定带有电话机。这就是说，它要摸到我们阵地跟前，组织炮火，突然攻击。副排长咬断了两股，就顺着断了的电线展开队伍，悄悄往回搜索。
    一阵密集的弹光突然迸发，——前面打响了，正是五连前沿班的阵地。炮兵团的光荣枪就是在那里缴获的。敌人的火力叫压住了，发出了求救的信号弹。这就是说：我们反击的炮火也要马上打到敌人后路来，如同上次那样，呆在这里不是闹着玩的。
    前面出现几条黑影，副排长就猛吼起来：
    “冲啊！敌人乱套了！”
    第五连迎头打，游动哨兜着屁股往回打，六七十个鬼子叫夹在中间，好热闹！我们的炮火也在敌人的二梯队里开花了。等到敌人还炮的时候，游动哨已经跑到交通壕里躲起来。
    可是白打一场，也没抓个活的。拿啥回去送礼？小组长杨玉芳说：“刚才往回打的时候，我一路上碰到二十几条死尸。敌人那能死的这样整齐？准是装死战术！”
    果然，等他带个小组搜索出去的时候，这一路只剩六条死尸了。
    可是他还不甘心，就挨个摸索。有一个温呼呼的，手直抖索。猛一举枪他就像猪似的叫着坐起来。大伙一乐就连拖带架的把他硬抬回来了。
    （完）
