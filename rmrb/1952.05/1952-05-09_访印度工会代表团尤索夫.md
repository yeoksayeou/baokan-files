An interview with Yousuf of the Indian Trade Union Delegation

    After the "May Day" Labor Day, the reporter interviewed Yousuf, a representative of the Indian Trade Union Delegation who was invited to China to participate in the "May Day" celebrations. He is the Vice Chairman of the All-India Trade Union Congress and has spent thirteen years in prison for the cause of the liberation of the working class. The "May Day" Labor Day rally in our capital left a strong impression on this working-class fighter who had just walked out of prison. He said: This is the first time I have seen such a great parade. This team demonstrates the unity and strength of the Chinese working class and reflects the happiness and joy of the Chinese people. When this team passed in front of my face, I not only felt the loveliness of the Chinese people, but also firmly believed that germ warfare and atomic bombs could not subdue the Chinese people.

    In recent years, India has suffered from a severe grain shortage. The broad masses are threatened by hunger. After arriving in Beijing, Yousuf and his travel companions first visited the rural areas after the land reform. He said that the style of farmers' houses, the types of vegetables and grains, and the current farming methods of farmers that he saw in the rural areas around Beijing are extremely similar to those in rural India. Therefore, he said: "I don't feel strange at all in the Chinese countryside. The only difference is that under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chinese farmers have undergone land reform, overthrown the feudal land system, and farmers who used to have no houses now live in new houses; tenant farmers who used to have no land now have land." He said that in the village he visited, the output increased by 50% in the first year after the land reform. In the second year, it increased by another 37% on the basis of the first year. A delightful cultural upsurge has been set off there, and night schools have united all the men and women in the village. He said: "China has freed itself from the shackles of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and after land reform, it has eliminated the grain shortage in just two years, and even has surplus grain for export."

    In Beijing, Yousuf listened to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' report on China's workers' movement and also saw workers' clubs or other welfare facilities. He said that the life of Chinese workers that he saw or heard about was happy and joyful.

    Yousuf said that the Indian people attach great importance to Chinese books and newspapers. The Indian people want to absorb knowledge and find experience in revolutionary struggle from them. He hopes that China will publish more books and periodicals in Indian languages ​​and solve the difficulties of language barriers by exchanging students to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people.

    访印度工会代表团尤索夫
    “五一”劳动节过后，记者访问了应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的印度工会代表团代表尤索夫。他是全印工会大会副主席，在为工人阶级解放事业的斗争中，曾经住过十三年监狱。我国首都的“五一”劳动节大会，给予这位刚刚走出狱门的工人阶级战士以强烈的印象。他说：我是第一次看见这样伟大的游行队伍。这队伍，表现了中国工人阶级的团结和力量，反映了中国人民的幸福和快乐。当这支队伍从我脸前走过的时候，我不仅感到中国人民的可爱，而且坚决相信：细菌战和原子弹都不能使中国人民屈服。
    近几年来，印度的粮荒十分严重。广大群众受着饥饿的威胁。尤索夫到达北京后，首先和他的旅伴们访问了土地改革后的农村。他说，他在京郊农村看见的农民住宅的样式，菜蔬和谷物的种类，以及目前农民的耕作方法，都和印度的农村极其相似。因此，他说：“在中国的农村中，一点不感到陌生。所不同的，只是中国农民在共产党领导下，经过了土地改革，推翻了封建的土地制度，从前没有房子的农民，现在都住着新房；从前没有土地的雇农，现在都有了土地。”他说他所访问的那个村子，土地改革后的第一年，生产量就提高了百分之五十。第二年，又在第一年的基础上提高了百分之三十七，那里已经掀起了令人惊喜的文化高潮，夜校团结了全村男女。他说：“中国摆脱了帝国主义和官僚资本主义的束缚，又经过了土地改革，仅仅两年时间，就消灭了粮荒，而且还有余粮出口。”
    尤索夫在北京，曾经听了全国总工会关于我国工人运动的报告，也看了工人俱乐部或其他福利设施。他说他所看到或听到的中国工人的生活是幸福而愉快的。
    尤索夫说，印度人民对于中国的书刊报章极为重视，印度人民都想从中吸取知识，找寻革命斗争的经验。他希望中国多多出版印度文的书刊，并用互派留学生的办法，解决语言文字不通的困难，以加强中印两国人民的友谊。    （林里）（附图片）
