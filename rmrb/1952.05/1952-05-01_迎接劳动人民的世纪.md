　　Welcoming the Century of the Working People
    Ma Xulun

    “Labor created man, labor created the world.”

    As we joyously celebrate the May Day International Labor Day, a festival of unity for the working people of the world, the people of the world, led by the working class, are achieving unprecedented unity on the frontlines of defending world peace, upholding human justice and security, and creating a better and happier life for humanity, and are marching towards even greater victories. As we review Engels's timeless words, we are even more encouraged with unparalleled confidence.

    For thousands of years, working people have toiled, bled, labored, and produced generation after generation, weaving human civilization with their blood and sweat, creating and discovering endless wealth for humanity, yet rarely enjoying it themselves. In every corner of the world, they have been invariably plundered by non-laboring rulers, who squandered their wealth at will, and subjected them to bloody destruction and trampling. The true and honest creators of history have long been slandered as "the mob" and "bandits" by the counterfeit "masters." However, history is ultimately the history of labor, the history of the working people, and it is bound to advance according to the will of the working masses.

    Under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin, the October Revolution in the Soviet Union first established the world's first state of the working people, thus ushering in the century of the working people. Our great motherland – the People's Republic of China – and the various People's Democratic countries are all people's states conceived, born, and grown up in this century of the people. This not only marks the epoch-making victory of the working people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, and the people of various People's Democratic countries, but also the victory of the working people of the whole world, the victory of all mankind.

    Only in the people's state can the working people be the masters of their own country, and only then can laborers and all people have the opportunity to unleash their greatest talents to participate in labor, fairly and reasonably enjoy the fruits of their labor, and can all sciences and arts be fully utilized according to the needs of the masses of people to improve and enrich their own lives and the lives of all mankind, and to open up a better and happier future for themselves and all mankind. The brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries in the construction of communism and socialism in recent years, the brilliant achievements of our great motherland since the establishment of the Central People's Government more than two years ago in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend peace, the brilliant achievements on the fronts of land reform and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the brilliant achievements in economic, cultural, and other New Democratic construction, and the emergence of countless labor models, bumper harvest models, and model workers in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign under the leadership of the working class, creating historically unprecedented highest records in industry, agriculture, and many other fields, and the recent nationwide "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, which have eliminated the "three evils" and "five poisons," and the new atmosphere of national economic stability and production development resulting from them, are all irrefutable proof.

    Only the working people are best at sincerely assisting and cooperating in a friendly manner with all peace-loving and democratic people of the world. The International Economic Conference, which closed in Moscow on the 12th of last month, brought together entrepreneurs, economists, trade unionists, and cooperative members from forty-nine countries with different economic systems, not only striking a blow at the U.S. imperialism's blockade and embargo policy of undermining normal trade relations of equality and mutual benefit between countries, opening up a new road for developing international trade and promoting international cooperation to improve the lives of the people of all countries, but also opening up a new road for mutual understanding and greater unity among the people of all countries, and for further safeguarding and consolidating lasting world peace.

    Working people of the world, unite! All peace-loving and democratic people of the world, unite! Oppose the aggression and war threats of U.S. imperialism! Oppose the U.S. imperialism's inhuman bacteriological warfare! Demand the conclusion of a five-power peace pact among China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France! Oppose the unilateral peace treaty with Japan! Oppose the U.S. imperialism's rearmament of Japan and West Germany! Develop friendly cooperation and economic and trade relations among the people of all countries!

    History always advances according to the will of the working masses. Now is the century of the working people. The era of any "untouchable" ambitious ruler acting arbitrarily for the selfish desires of a few privileged classes is gone forever. The fate of Hitler and Mussolini is an example for these people. Now the U.S. imperialists and their small group of accomplices, in the face of repeated failures in the war of aggression against Korea, are unable to accept the lessons of history and reality, and are even more mad and shameless, even more inhumane, and even more contrary to the will of the people of the whole world than Hitler and Mussolini. Their inevitable fate of suffering even more shameful defeat and suffering even more severe punishment than Hitler and Mussolini is completely certain. The Chinese and Korean people and the people of the whole world will inevitably achieve even greater victories on the basis of the current victory, and this is also completely certain.

    Long live the unity and victory of the working people of the world!
    Long live the unity and victory of all peace-loving and democratic people of the world!

　　迎接劳动人民的世纪
    马叙伦
    “劳动创造了人，劳动创造世界。”
    欣逢全世界劳动人民团结的节日——五一劳动节，以工人阶级为首的全世界人民正以空前未有的团结，在保卫世界和平、维护人类正义和安全、创造人类美好幸福的战线上，取得极伟大的胜利，并向更大的胜利迈进，我们温习恩格斯这亘古不朽的遗言，更鼓舞了我们无比的信心。
    几千年来，劳动人民世世代代地流汗、流血、劳动、生产，用血和汗织成人类的文明，创造和发掘了人类无穷无尽的财富，自己却很少享用，在世界的每个角落，毫无例外地被不劳而食的统治者们强取豪夺，恣意挥霍，还有血腥的破坏和践踏。真正的朴实的历史创造者，长期被冒牌的“主人”诬蔑为“群氓”，为“流寇”。然而历史终究是劳动的历史，劳动人民的历史，它必然遵循着劳动群众的意向前进的。
    在伟大的列宁、斯大林的领导下，苏联十月革命首先创建了世界上第一个劳动人民自己的国家，从此开始了劳动人民的世纪。我们伟大祖国——中华人民共和国、和各人民民主国家都是在这人民世纪中孕育、诞生和成长起来的人民国家。这不但标志着苏联劳动人民、中国人民、和各人民民主国家人民划时代的胜利，也是全世界劳动人民的胜利，全人类的胜利。
    只有在人民的国家里，劳动人民才是自己国家的主人，劳动者和一切人民才有可能发挥最大的才智参加劳动，公平合理地享用劳动成果，一切科学和艺术才能完全按照人民群众的要求，充分地用来改善和丰富自己以及全人类的生活，开辟自己和全人类更美好、更幸福的前途。苏联、各人民民主国家近年来在共产主义、社会主义建设上的辉煌成就，我们伟大祖国自中央人民政府成立两年多来，在抗美援朝保卫和平斗争中的辉煌成就，在土地改革、镇压反革命战线上的辉煌成就，在经济文化等新民主主义建设上的辉煌成就，在工人阶级领导下进行爱国主义增产节约运动中，涌现无数的劳动模范、丰产模范、模范工作者，创造了历史上工农业和许多方面空前未有的最高纪录，在最近更展开全国规模的“三反”“五反”运动，消除了“三害”“五毒”、和由此而产生全国经济稳定、生产发展的新气象，都是无可辩驳的证明。
    也只有劳动人民才最善于和世界一切爱好和平民主人民真诚互助，友好合作。上月十二日在莫斯科闭幕的国际经济会议，就聚会了四十九个不同经济制度国家的企业家、经济学者、工会和合作社人士，不但打击了美国帝国主义破坏各国平等互利的正常贸易关系的封锁禁运政策，开辟了发展国际贸易和促进国际合作改善各国人民生活的新道路，而且也开辟了各国人民相互了解和更加团结、更加维护和巩固世界持久和平的新道路。
    全世界劳动人民团结起来！全世界一切爱好和平民主人民团结起来！反对美帝国主义的侵略和战争威胁！反对美帝国主义进行灭绝人性的细菌战！要求缔结中、苏、美、英、法五国和平公约！反对片面的对日和约！反对美帝国主义重新武装日本和西德！发展各国人民间的友好合作和经济贸易关系！
    历史永远按照劳动群众的意志前进的，现在是劳动人民的世纪了，任何“不可一世”的野心统治者，为着少数特权阶级私欲横行霸道的时代是一去不复返了，希特勒和墨索里尼的下场，就是这批人的榜样，现在美国帝国主义者和它的一小撮帮凶们，在侵朝战争着着失败中，不能接受历史和现实的教训，比希特勒和墨索里尼还要更加疯狂无耻，更加灭绝人性，更加违背全世界人民群众的意向，其必然遭受比希特勒和墨索里尼还要更加可耻的失败，遭受比希特勒和墨索里尼还要更加严重的惩罚，是完全肯定了的。中朝人民和全世界人民必然在现在胜利的基础上，获得更伟大的胜利，也是完全肯定了的。
    全世界劳动人民团结胜利万岁！
    全世界一切爱好和平民主人民团结胜利万岁！
