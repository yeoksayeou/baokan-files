Promoting Advanced Experiences in Civil Engineering and Construction
Accelerating the Development of the Motherland's Construction Undertakings

The advanced working methods of Su Changyou's bricklaying method, Xie Wanfu's carpentry group, Yang Dezhong's plastering group, and Yu Donghai's pointing group in civil engineering and construction have rationally organized and utilized the labor force. Due to the creation of these advanced experiences, not only has production efficiency been improved and engineering costs reduced, but also the difficulty of insufficient technical workers has been solved, accelerating the development of the motherland's construction undertakings. This is Su Changyou demonstrating the first process of the bricklaying method at the demonstration meeting of the Construction Class of the Northeast Workers' Political University.

Students of the Construction Class of the Northeast Workers' Political University learning Su Changyou's bricklaying method and engaging in bricklaying work.

Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method was created based on the spirit of Su Changyou's bricklaying method. Its basic characteristic is that it has meticulously divided the work according to the work procedures and placed these processes in a continuous process, greatly shortening the production time of the finished product. This is Xie Wanfu personally carrying out the material trimming according to advanced working methods.

Yang Dezhong's plastering group's assembly line method was also created based on the advanced experience of Su Changyou's bricklaying method. Due to the implementation of this advanced operation method, not only has work efficiency increased by 60% compared to the past, but the quality is also better than before. This is the first process of plastering sand mortar, where a skilled worker is responsible for leveling the corners, and then an apprentice plasters the middle.

The first process of Su Changyou's bricklaying method is the responsibility of a second-grade worker. His task is to build the outer skin and corners of the wall. The quality of bricklaying is controlled by the leaders and technical heads of each "bricklaying group". This is Su Changyou demonstrating the operation of the first process.

The second operation process of Su Changyou's bricklaying method is carried out by an apprentice who is responsible for delivering mortar to the wall, digging mortar, and mixing mortar in the mortar trough. This is the apprentice providing mortar for the technician to use.

One of the main processes of Xie Wanfu's carpentry assembly line method is the marking work.

This is the scene of students from the Northeast Workers' Political University using the mortar boards (for apprentices) created by Yang Dezhong's group to plaster the walls.

In order to save technical workers, Su Changyou's bricklaying method only uses a third-grade worker to be responsible for building the inner skin of the wall. This is a scene of students from the Northeast Workers' Political University demonstrating the construction of the inner skin of the wall.

The final process of Su Changyou's bricklaying method is carried out by apprentices who are responsible for placing mortar on the wall for the technicians to use.

Due to the implementation of the assembly line method, the production efficiency of Xie Wanfu's carpentry group has doubled. Originally, one worker could only make ten window frames a day, but now they can make more than twenty window frames.

Yang Dezhong using the wooden float he created to smooth the wall.

The advantages of Yu Donghai's wall pointing assembly line method are not only clear division of labor, mutual assistance and supervision, ensuring that the wall pointing does not bulge; but also saving materials, improving technology, and enabling apprentices to formally participate in the work. This is Yu Donghai pointing the horizontal joints.

One of the main experiences of Yu Donghai's pointing group is work specialization. This is a scene of a second-grade technician pointing the vertical joints after a first-grade technician has pointed the horizontal joints.

In order to utilize the mortar swept down during pointing and not waste the country's resources, Yu Donghai's group specifically designated apprentices to collect the mortar and reuse it. For the same building, while others use five bags of cement, Yu Donghai's group only needs three and a half bags of cement.

    推广土木建筑先进经验
    加速发展祖国建设事业
    苏长有砌砖法、谢万福木工小组、杨德重抹灰小组和于东海抅缝小组的土木建筑先进工作方法，合理地组织和使用了劳动力。由于这些先进经验的创造，不但提高了生产效率，降低工程成本，同时还解决了技术工人不足的困难，加速发展了祖国的建设事业。这是苏长有在东北工人政治大学建筑班表演大会上表演砌砖法第一道工序时的情形。
    东北工人政治大学建筑班学员学习苏长有砌砖法进行砌砖工作。
    谢万福木工流水作业法是根据苏长有砌砖法的精神创造出来的，它的基本特点是按照工作程序进行了细致分工，并把这些工序放在一个连续的过程中，大大缩短了成品的制作时间。这是谢万福亲自在按照先进的工作方法进行括料时的情形。
    杨德重抹灰小组的流水作业法也是根据苏长有砌砖法的先进经验创造出来的。由于实行了这种先进的操作方法，不但工作效率比以前提高了百分之六十，同时质量也比以前好。这是抹砂子灰的第一道工序，由技工掌角抄平，以后再由徒工抹中间。
    苏长有砌砖法的第一道工序是由一个二等工负责的。他的任务是砌墙外皮和墙角。掌握砌砖的质量的，是每个“砌砖组”的领导者和技术负责人。这是苏长有在表演第一道工序操作时的情形。
    苏长有砌砖法的第二道操作工序是由一个徒工进行向墙上递灰、挖灰和在灰槽内拌灰的工作。这是徒工正在供给技工用灰时的情形。
    谢万福木工流水作业法主要工序之一是划线工作。
    这是东北工人政治大学学员使用杨德重小组创造的托灰板（徒工用）抹墙面时的情形。
    为了节省技术工人，苏长有砌砖法只用一个三等工来负责砌墙内皮的工作。这是东北工人政治大学学员在表演砌墙内皮时的情形。
    苏长有砌砖法最后一道工序是由徒工负责向墙上摆灰，供给技工取用。
    由于实行了流水作业法，谢万福木工小组的生产效率提高了一倍。原来一个工人一天只能制作十个窗架，现在却可以制作二十多个窗架了。
    杨德重用自己创造的木抹子抹平墙面时的情形。
    于东海抅墙缝流水作业法的好处不但分工明确，互助监督，抅墙缝时保证不鼓出；同时还可以节省材料，提高技术，使徒工也能正式参加工作。这是于东海在抅横缝时的情形。
    于东海抅缝小组的主要经验之一是工作专业化。这是一个二等技工在一等技工抅完横缝后进行抅立缝时的情形。
    为了利用抅缝时扫下来的灰，不浪费国家的资财，于东海小组特别指定徒工把这些灰收起来再用，同样一幢房，旁人用五袋水泥，于东海小组只需要三袋半水泥就够了。
