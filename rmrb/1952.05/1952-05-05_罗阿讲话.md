Roa's Speech

When Hugo's brilliance began to bother the bourgeoisie and make them uncomfortable, they began to find Hugo "popular" and "banal."

We have come from afar to celebrate four geniuses of world significance with you today. These four celebrities – especially Hugo, because he and I belong to the same country – I know they are indeed "popular," but this so-called "popular" is completely different in meaning from what the bourgeoisie calls "popular." For the people of the world, these four giants are popular and universal. Everyone needs air, everyone needs freedom, and the four cultural celebrities are as popular and universal as our need for air and freedom; like everyone's need for sunlight, peace, and the pursuit of happiness, they are as universal and popular as everyone's sense of self-esteem.

Some accidental events often have a cleverly symbolic meaning. For example, when I left Paris, the last Frenchman I met was the driver who drove me to the airport. On his seat, I found a worn-out copy of Hugo's novel "Les Misérables." This made me happy. Also, in Prague, I asked a student for directions, and when the student realized I was French, he took out a worn-out copy of Hugo's poetry collection "Les Châtiments" from his pocket. This also made me very happy. The second thing I loved was that when the Soviet pilot was having dinner with us in Krasnoyarsk, we couldn't communicate in words, but the comrade raised his glass and said in a Russian accent, "Victor Hugo!" which made us all smile knowingly. The last thing I loved was that the Mongolian translator who took us to visit Ulan Bator said that he had learned French from two of Hugo's novels, one was "The Hunchback of Notre-Dame" and the other was "Ninety-Three."

All over the world, this series of unrecognized friends, from the proletarians of Paris to the Soviet pilots, from the Czech university students to the Mongolian elementary school teachers, this thread connects to a Chinese writer, Mr. Mao Dun, who greeted us in Beijing the other day, and it is thanks to his initiative that we have today's celebration.

Yes, Hugo is popular and universal. For the people, he is as popular and universal as the sunshine shining on the earth. In the name of the French Writers Association, in the name of the French people, I want to express my joy here. This time I was able to come to China and know that millions of Chinese readers love the great writers of China's past, such as Lu Xun, and the great writers of foreign countries' past, such as Hugo and Gogol, equally.

Hugo belongs to the people of the world. Because he brings common food to everyone, that is, truth and poetry; truth is bread, and poetry is wine. We can get many profound lessons from Hugo's works. Today I only want to mention one of them, which may be the most important lesson.

In 1860, the Anglo-French imperialist allied forces looted and burned the Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan). Hugo protested, and his conclusion was that at that time, "the governments of European countries are often robbers, but the people of various countries will never be like this." Hugo taught us this way: be loyal to the people, be loyal to all the people, so we must rise up to resist the reactionary government, resist to the end, that is, resist the reactionary ruling class that exploits and slaughters the people.

Hugo, like those progressive elements of his time, had some generous fantasies and utopian hopes. But whenever he faced concrete things, faced the realistic problem of imperialist colonial wars, he always used brave thoughts and a brave heart to resist the French government and be loyal to the people of the world.

When the Anglo-French imperialist allied forces invaded China, he called that war an "act of theft"; he called the French emperor and the British queen who presided over the war at that time "thieves."

In 1863, the Tsarist Russian army invaded Poland. Hugo said to the Tsarist Russian soldiers on behalf of the Polish patriots: "Those opposite you are not your enemies, but your role models."

When Napoleon III invaded Mexico, Hugo was not afraid of the slander of the Parisian bourgeoisie at that time, saying that he was "selling the country." He said to the Mexican patriots: "It is not France that is fighting with you, but the court of Napoleon III is fighting you; rise up and fight! Be fierce! The French soldiers are not war criminals, they are forced to be in a terrible and hateful situation, they hate the war while fighting, they are a group of blind forces deprived of ideological consciousness."

In 1870, the Cuban people revolted against the Spanish oppressors. Hugo wrote to the Cuban people, shouting: "A nation cannot occupy another nation, just as no individual can occupy another person! I say to the Spanish government: Return Cuba to the Cuban people! If the French government still occupies Haiti (Haiyidi) today, I will say the same to the French government: Return Haiti to the Haitian people!"

Today, at this moment, the heroic Korean people are fighting side by side with the admirable Chinese People's Volunteers to resist the aggression of American imperialism; the great Vietnamese people are fighting vigorously against the aggression of French colonialists.

The voice that the French people hear is the voice of Hugo, not the voice of the imperialists. The walls of France are filled with the name of Henri Martin. He is a 23-year-old French sailor who has become a symbol of the French people's will to fight. When Henri Martin was 17 years old, he was already a hero. He took up arms and joined the French guerrillas to fight against the German invaders. But today he is imprisoned by the American and French imperialists because he refuses to fight against the Vietnamese people, because he advises his partners to act in unison with him. The French people unanimously demand the release of Henri Martin.

In France and China, millions of young people, like Henri Martin, are learning literature and thought from Hugo's works. Today, I bring to you not only the fraternal greetings of all the Communist Party writers and progressive writers in France, these writers are continuing Hugo's cause; at the same time, I also bring to you a peace warrior, the news of Henri Martin, the outstanding son of the French people. Of course, he is not a writer, but he is a faithful student of Hugo. He embodies the object of our service, that is, the goal supported by the vast majority of the French people: hatred for warmongers, for murderers, for robbers and murderers, and at the same time, love for the people of the world and world peace.

What Hugo said 75 years ago continues to sound like a tolling bell in the world, as if tolling the death knell for the enemies of mankind. Hugo said: "The first condition of peace is liberation." In October 1917, the great Soviet people were liberated; in October 1949, the great Chinese people were liberated. Today, facing Hugo's tomb, facing the great poet who once said "I salute the future revolution" at a peace conference in 1869, I say to him from Beijing: "Master, your hope is being realized. Today, in the capitals of all peace-loving countries in the world, everyone is commemorating you. In New China, in Beijing, you are also being commemorated by us. Your life, your suffering, your creation, all have not been in vain." (Attached picture)

    罗阿讲话
    当雨果的光芒，开始使资产阶级觉得碍事，觉得不自在的时候，资产阶级也就开始觉得雨果“通俗”、“平淡无奇”。
    我们不远千里而来，今天和诸位在一起，庆祝具有世界意义的四位天才。这四位名人——尤其是雨果，因为他和我，是属于同一个祖国的，我知道他们的确是“通俗”的，可是这所谓“通俗”，和资产阶级的所谓“通俗”，意义是完全不同的。对于世界的人民说，这四位巨人是具有通俗性的，普遍性的。人人都需要空气，人人都需要自由，四位文化名人，也就跟我们对于空气的需要，对于自由的需要，那样的通俗和普遍；像人人对于日光的需要，对于和平的需要，对于幸福的企求，也就像人皆有之的自尊心那样的普遍、通俗。
    一些偶然发生的事，往往很巧妙地具有象征的意义。譬如当我离开巴黎的时候，我所遇到的最后的一个法国人，是开汽车把我送到飞机场上去的司机。在他的坐垫上，我发现了一本已经看旧了的，看破了的雨果的小说“悲惨世界”。这件事使我心里喜欢。又如：在布拉格（Prague），我向一个学生问路，那个学生一发觉我是法国人以后，就从衣服口袋里，掏出一本也是已经看旧了的雨果的诗集“惩罚集”。这件事也使我心里很喜欢。第二件使我心爱的事：是那位苏联的飞机驾驶员，在Kr-    asnoiarsk跟我们一起吃饭的时候，彼此言语不通，那位同志举起酒杯来，用俄国口音说：“维克多·雨果”！使我们都很会意地微笑。最后令我心爱的一件事：就是那位领我们去参观“乌兰巴托”（UlanBator）的蒙古翻译同志，他说他曾经在雨果的两本小说里，学习了法文，一本是“巴黎圣母院”，另一本是“九十三年”。
    在全世界，这一连串的，不相识的朋友们，从巴黎的无产者，到苏联的驾驶员，从捷克的大学生，到蒙古的小学教师，这一根线索一直联到一位中国作家身上，就是前两天，迎接我们到达北京的茅盾先生，由于他的造意，才有我们今天的庆祝会。
    不错，雨果是通俗的，普遍的。对于人民说，他是通俗普遍的，就跟阳光普照在大地上一样。用法国作家协会的名义，用法国人民的名义，我要在这里向诸位表达我的快乐。这次能够来到中国，并且知道中国几百万的读者，把中国的过去伟大作家，譬如鲁迅，和外国的过去伟大作家，譬如：雨果、果戈理，同样地热爱着。
    雨果是属于世界人民的。因为他将共同的粮食带给大家，那就是真理和诗歌；真理是面包，诗歌是葡萄酒。我们在雨果作品中可以得到很多的意义深远的教训。今天我只想举出其中之一，可能就是一个最重要的教训。
    一八六○年，英法帝国主义的联军劫掠了并且烧毁了圆明园。雨果提出抗议，他的结论说，当时欧洲“各国政府往往是强盗，但是各国人民，决不至于如此”。雨果这样教给我们；忠于人民，忠于所有的人民，因此要起来反抗反动政府，反抗到底，也就是反抗剥削人民，屠杀人民的那些反动的统治阶级。
    雨果和他当时的那些思想比较进步的分子一样，曾经有过一些慷慨的幻想和乌托邦式的希望。但是每当他面对具体的事，面对帝国主义的殖民地战争，这么一个现实问题时，他总是用了勇敢的思想和勇敢的心，去反抗法国政府，忠实于世界人民。
    当英法帝国主义联军侵略中国的时候，他管那一次战争叫做“盗窃行为”；他把当时主持战争的法国皇帝，和英国女皇，都叫做“贼”。
    一八六三年，帝俄的军队侵略波兰。雨果替波兰的爱国志士们向帝俄的兵士们说：“在你们对面的不是你们的敌人，而是你们的榜样。”
    拿破仑第三侵略墨西哥时，雨果不怕当时巴黎资产阶级诬蔑他，说他“卖国”，他对墨西哥的志士们这样说：“并不是法国在跟你们打仗，是拿破仑第三的朝廷在打你们；起来战斗吧！凶猛一点吧！法国的兵士们并不是战争的罪犯，他们被逼迫，处在可怕、可憎的境地，他们一边打，一边又讨厌战争，他们是被人剥夺了思想意识的一群盲目的力量。”
    一八七○年，古巴人民起义反抗西班牙压迫者。雨果写信给古巴人民，大声疾呼：“一个民族不能占有另一个民族，正和任何个别的人，不能占有另一个人一样！我对西班牙政府说：把古巴还给古巴人民！如果今天法国政府还占领着Haiti（海依底），我也将一样地对法国政府说：把海依底还给海依底人民！”
    今天在这个时候，英勇的朝鲜人民，正和令人钦佩的中国人民志愿军并肩作战，反抗美帝国主义的侵略；伟大的越南人民，正在精神抖擞地反抗法国殖民者的侵略。
    法国人民所听到的声音，是雨果的声音，而不是帝国主义者的声音。全法国的墙上，写满了亨利·马丁（HenriMartni）这一个名字。他是一个二十三岁的法国水兵，他已经成了法国人民的斗争意志的象征。亨利·马丁十七岁的时候，已经是一个英雄，他手里拿了武器，参加法国游击队，和德寇战斗。可是今天他被美法帝国主义者，关在监牢里，因为他不肯向越南人民作战，因为他劝他的伙伴们也跟他一致行动。法国人民众口同声要求释放亨利·马丁。
    在法国，在中国，有千百万年青人，也跟亨利·马丁一样在雨果的作品中学习文学和思想。今天我不仅给诸位带来了法国所有的共产党党员作家，和进步作家们的，兄弟的敬礼，这一些作家们，正在继续进行雨果的事业；同时我也给诸位带来了一位和平战士，法国人民的优秀儿子亨利·马丁的消息。固然他并不是作家，可是他是雨果的忠实的学生。他具体化了（体现了）我们服务的对象，也就是绝大多数法国人民所拥护的目标：对于战争贩子，对于杀人犯们的憎恨，对于强盗们和凶手们的愤恨，同时对于世界人民，和世界和平的热爱。
    雨果在七十五年前所说的话，继续地在世界上发出洪钟般的声音，仿佛在给人类的公敌撞丧钟。雨果说：“和平的第一个条件，是解放。”一九一七年十月，伟大的苏联人民解放了；一九四九年十月伟大的中国人民解放了。今天我面向雨果的坟墓，面向曾经在一八六九年某一次和平会议上说过“我向未来的革命致敬”这一句话的伟大诗人，我从北京对他说：“大师，你的希望正在实现中。今天在全世界爱好和平的各国首都里，大家正在纪念你，在新中国，在北京，你也正在被我们纪念。你的一生，你所受的痛苦，你的创作，全部都没有白费。”（附图片）
