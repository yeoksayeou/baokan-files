The Central South Military and Administrative Committee Trade Department held a native produce exchange conference which opened on April 16th and closed on April 30th. In addition to representatives from state-owned trading companies and cooperatives from across the Central South region, the conference was attended by private merchants and representatives from state-owned enterprises in major administrative regions.

Transactions at the meeting totaled 102.9 billion yuan, involving 142 kinds of native and special products, opening up sales channels for some slow-selling native products. For example, transactions involving slow-selling tea oil, domestic tobacco, domestic sugar, lotus seeds, longan, and live pigs reached over 25 billion yuan. Trade relations between regions also gradually recovered. Medicinal materials from the Northwest region and pickled mustard tuber from the Southwest region were widely sold in the Central South provinces, while scissors and bamboo from the Central South region were sold as far as the Northeast. Hubei's wood ear fungus and Hunan's umbrellas were sold as far as the Northwest.

In order to implement the spirit of serving the peasants and serving production, the conference criticized the viewpoint of only selling and not buying, and the pursuit of pure profit. In past exchange conferences, various regions always lowered the prices of slow-moving goods and blindly purchased popular goods. This conference clearly pointed out that transactions should be carried out based on the principle of benefiting both production and sales, and in the spirit of solving the difficulties of peasants' spring plowing and production. For example, the Central South Oil Company purchased 10,000 dan of tea oil from the Hunan Provincial Trading Company, with a transaction price of 440,000 yuan per dan. The seller's selling price was 5% lower than the cost, and the buyer's purchase price was only 3% lower than the listed price. Neither side talked about profit, but both sides considered that the cash from the transaction could be invested in the tea oil producing areas of western Hunan to continue purchasing tea oil that peasants urgently needed to sell, which could solve the livelihood of 100,000 peasants for a month, so the transaction was quickly completed. Hunan and Guangxi also exchanged large quantities of slow-selling homespun cloth and sugar cubes. The Hubei Trading Company exchanged 300,000 jin of slow-selling tobacco leaves from the Xiaogan and Daye special districts of the province with the Wuhan State-Owned Dada Tobacco Factory in a barter trade, solving many difficulties for the peasants.

In transactions, state-owned trading departments also provided as much assistance as possible to private merchants in terms of purchasing and sales.

The meeting also reviewed the implementation of past contracts and strictly criticized bourgeois management methods such as the pursuit of pure profit and departmentalism. (For example, some units failed to fulfill contract stipulations due to price fluctuations, resulting in violations such as refusal to accept goods and delayed delivery, hindering material exchanges and causing huge losses.) When signing new contracts, measures were put in place to strictly comply with and implement contracts. It was stipulated that if payment was delayed after the goods arrived, a progressive fine would be imposed under the supervision of the Central South District Native Produce Company and the People's Bank of China. The quality specifications were to be clearly specified in the contract. If the goods delivered did not meet the standards, they should not be refused outright; both parties could renegotiate the price. Except in special circumstances, goods must be delivered on time; otherwise, a progressive fine of 1% would be imposed for each one to five days of delay. Specific regulations were also made regarding pricing issues. For contracts involving spot goods and cash, the price should be set immediately. If the contract is for forward goods and the price is fixed, and the buyer has not paid a deposit in advance, the seller should deliver the goods at the agreed price if the price increase is below 10%; however, if the price increase exceeds 10%, it should be resolved through negotiation between both parties. If the buyer has paid a deposit and the price increase exceeds 20%, it should be resolved through negotiation between both parties. Conversely, if the price falls by 5%, the contract should still be fulfilled at the original price; if the price falls by more than 5%, it should be resolved through negotiation between both parties. Price fluctuations are all standardized according to the state listed price at the place of delivery. In addition, the conference adopted a barter trade method for small-volume native products and currently slow-selling goods. After Guangdong's Xiangyun silk and undershirts were exchanged with Jiangxi's ham, both sides' slow-moving goods became hot-selling goods.

After the meeting, a trade delegation was organized to conduct transactions in North China, East China, and other regions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南贸易部召开土产交流会议
    成交共一千多亿元，交易土产特产一百四十二种
    批判了某些单位的单纯营利观点和本位主义思想
    中南军政委员会贸易部在四月十六日召开的土产交流会议，已在同月三十日闭幕。出席会议的除中南区各地国营贸易公司和合作社的代表外，还有私商和各大行政区国营企业代表。
    会上成交总值一千零二十九亿元，交易土产特产一百四十二种，为一部分滞销土产打开了销路。如滞销的茶油、土烟、土糖、莲子、桂元、生猪等，在会上成交达二百五十多亿元。区际间的贸易关系也逐渐恢复，西北区的药材和西南区的榨菜广销中南各省，中南区的剪刀、竹子远销东北，湖北木耳和湖南雨伞远销西北。
    为了贯彻为农民服务、为生产服务的精神，会议批判了只卖不买和单纯营利观点。在过去的交流会上，各地总是把冷货价钱压低，盲目收进热货。这次会议明确指出要根据产销两利的原则和解决农民春耕生产困难的精神进行交易。如中南油脂公司向湖南省贸易公司购进一万担茶油，成交价格每担四十四万元。卖方销价比成本低百分之五，买方购价仅比牌价低百分之三，双方都谈不到利润，但双方考虑以成交现款投放到湘西茶油产区继续收购农民急待脱售的茶油，可以解决十万农民一个月的生活，所以迅速成交。湖南、广西也互以滞销的土布和糖块大量交换。湖北贸易公司将该省孝感、大冶两专区滞销的烟叶和武汉公营大达烟厂用以货易货方式，成交三十万斤，替农民解决了很多困难。
    在交易中，国营贸易部门对私商在购销方面也尽量予以协助。
    会议并检查了过去合同执行情况，严格批判了单纯营利观点和本位主义等资产阶级经营方式。（如有的单位因价格涨落，不履行合同规定，发生拒收、迟交等违法行为，妨碍了物资交流，造成了巨大损失。）在订立新的合同时，并订出了严格遵守和贯彻执行合同的办法。规定凡货到而延期付款者，在中南区土产公司及中国人民银行监督下，按累进办法罚款。关于品质规格要在合同上规定出明确标准，如交货不合标准，不应拒不收货，双方可重新协议价格。除了特殊情况，一定要按期交货，否则每逾期一至五天，按百分之一比例累进罚款。关于作价问题，也有了具体的规定。凡合同是现货现款者当即订出价格；如果合同是期货定款者，买方事先没付定金，此项物品价格上涨百分之十以下，卖方应照定价交货；但价格上涨率超过百分之十，则由双方协商解决；如买方已付定金，涨价超过百分之二十，则由双方协商解决。反之，如果物价下跌百分之五，仍按原定价格履行合同；下跌超过百分之五，则由双方协商解决。价格涨落，都统一按交货地点的国家牌价为标准。此外，会议并对小宗土产品和当前滞销品，采取了以货易货的交易方式。广东的香云纱、汗衫与江西的火腿交换后，双方的冷货都变成了热货。
    会后并组织了交易团，前往华北、华东等地进行交易。    （新华社）
