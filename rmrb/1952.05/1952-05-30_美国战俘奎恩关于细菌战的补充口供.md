    Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Supplementary confession of American prisoner of war Quinn regarding germ warfare. The full text is as follows:
    When I was dropping germ bombs in North Korea, there were four other people living in the same room with me, namely Jack Larson (Lieutenant Navigator), Smid (Lieutenant Pilot), Kenneth L. Inack (Lieutenant Navigator), and another Lieutenant Navigator, who was a Scotsman, whose name I can't remember, but I think Inack must remember his name. On January 4th, the day after I performed my first mission, I talked to all of the above people about my having dropped germ bombs. I first talked to Larson about it to see how he felt about it. I told him I had heard a special order communicated once, and the officer giving the order seemed to think the whole thing was so secret. I told him the plane was guarded, and the bombs under the wings had no fuses. I reminded him that we had heard lectures on germ warfare, and before I told him that I was sure these were germ bombs, he said, "Germ bombs." He was also sure these were germ bombs. He thought that whether we agreed with germ warfare or not, it made no difference. If you are ordered to do such a thing, you cannot refuse. When we came back after dinner, we talked to Inack about my germ bombing mission. He asked me, "What did these bombs look like?" "Where were these bombs (he meant were these bombs mounted on the wings or in the bomb bay)?" "Why did they pick you?" I answered his questions, but I didn't know why they picked me. The question was answered the next day, because the next day Larson told us that he had received a special mission the night before (they were not only picking special people to drop germ bombs, anyone could be given a special germ bombing mission). Larson's mission was on the night of January 4th. He said that the officer ordered him and the pilot to drop the bombs under their wings (four germ bombs) southeast of Pyongyang, in the area where I had dropped bombs the night before (five miles south of Pyongyang, three miles east of the highway bridge). On January 6th, Inack received a special mission to drop germ bombs southeast of Pyongyang. His plane was also guarded, and he had heard a special order communicated just like me and Larson. Inack had a second special mission (carrying germ bombs), I think it was on January 11th, to drop them on a large city—not Pyongyang—I think it was Sariwon or Kumsan-ri. I can't be sure how many germ bombs he carried each time, but I'm sure he carried six germ bombs in total for the two missions. Smid received a special mission on January 7th to carry four germ bombs and drop them northeast of Kumsan-ri. He dropped these bombs near Kumsan-ri, and I believe the place where he dropped the bombs was where I dropped germ bombs on January 11th—three miles north of Kumsan-ri, five miles east of the railway. We talked to that navigator (the Scotsman, whose name I can't remember) about our special missions, but I don't remember him mentioning that he had a special mission himself (dropping germ bombs). I can't be very sure, but I think he had completed fifty-five missions before January or in early January. Duffey was a navigator (Freese X. Duffey, Captain) living in the room at the back of our house. On January 6th, he told us that he had a special mission the night before to take germ bombs to the southeast of Pyongyang (I can't be very sure how many he took, nor can I be sure if he said how many he took, but I think it was four germ bombs). He talked as if we didn't know that germ warfare was already going on. When I described to Larson what kind of order was communicated to him and told him that we ourselves had accepted special missions (germ bombing missions), he was surprised. We talked for a while about germ warfare, and how terrible it seemed. We doubted whether germ warfare would be just like other kinds of warfare, and wouldn't be so terrible after a while. We wondered if the next step would be the use of atomic warfare, and we hoped not. We all agreed that whoever was responsible for ordering the launch of germ warfare must have had his good reasons for doing so. There were three other people in the same house—a Captain (pilot, he was the pilot when Stanley's plane was shot down), a Major pilot, whom Smid knew well (these two had not yet started flying missions at that time). There was also a Lieutenant Navigator, who had completed fifty-five missions before the start of germ warfare. I can't remember the names of these people.
    Our planes only had guards when we were accepting germ bombing missions. Ordinary missions never had guards. I'm sure these guards belonged to the base's Air Force Police Squadron. They were soldiers. I didn't know them, so I can't be very sure they belonged to the base's Air Force Police Squadron.

### 美国战俘奎恩关于细菌战的补充口供

    美国战俘奎恩关于细菌战的补充口供
    【新华社二十九日讯】美国战俘奎恩关于细菌战的补充口供。全文如下：
    当我在北朝鲜投细菌弹的时候，和我住在同一房间的还有另外四个人，就是杰克·拉荪（中尉领航员），史密德（中尉驾驶员），凯尼斯·L·伊纳克（中尉领航员），及另外一个中尉领航员，他是一个苏格兰人，他的名字我记不起来了，我想伊纳克一定记得他的名字。我在一月四号，就是我执行第一次任务之后第二天，我和上述所有的人谈过我曾经投过细菌弹。我先和拉荪谈起这件事，看看他对这事情的感觉如何。我告诉他我曾听过一次特别的命令传达，传令官的样子好像这全部事情都是那样秘密，我告诉他飞机有警卫守着，机翼下的炸弹没有信管，我提醒他我们曾听过细菌战争课，在我没有告诉他我确信这是细菌弹之前，他就说道：“细菌弹”。他也确信这是细菌弹。他认为，不论我们赞成细菌战与否，那都没有什么不同。假如你被命令去做这种事，你就不能拒绝。我们吃了晚饭后回来时，和伊纳克谈起我的投细菌弹的任务，他问我：“这些弹的样子怎么样？”“这些弹在那里（他的意思是这些弹装在机翼上还是弹仓里）？”“为什么他们选上了你？”我回答了他的问题，但是我不知道他们为什么选上了我。这个问题在第二天得到了答案，因为第二天拉荪告诉我们他在前一天晚上接到一次特殊任务（他们不是只挑选特殊的人去投细菌弹，任何人都可能被给予特殊的投细菌弹任务）。拉荪的任务是在一月四号晚上，他说，传令官吩咐他和驾驶员把他们机翼下的炸弹（四个细菌弹）投在平壤东南，就在我前一个晚上投弹的地方一带（平壤之南五哩，公路桥之东三哩）。一月六号伊纳克接到一个特殊任务到平壤东南去投细菌弹，他的飞机也有警卫看守，他也和我及拉荪一样听过一次特别的命令传达。伊纳克曾有过第二次特殊任务（带细菌弹），我想那是在一月十一号，投在某一大城市——不是平壤——我想是沙里院或军隅里。我不能肯定他每次带了多少个细菌弹，但是我确信他两次任务共带六个细菌弹。史密德在一月七号接到一次特殊任务带四个细菌弹投在军隅里东北，他把这些弹投在军隅里附近，我相信他投弹的地方就是我在一月十一号投细菌弹的地方——军隅里之北三哩，铁路之东五哩。我们和那个领航员（就是那个苏格兰人，他的名字我记不起来了）谈过我们的特殊任务，但是我不记得他曾提起过他自己有过特殊任务（投细菌弹）。我不能十分肯定，但我想他在一月份以前或在一月初已完成了五十五次任务。达费是一个领航员（弗雷雪斯·X·达费，上尉）住在我们那座屋子的背面房间里。一月六号他告诉我们在前一天晚上他有一次特殊任务带细菌弹到平壤东南去（我不能十分肯定他带了几个，也不能肯定他是否说过他带了多少，但我想是四个细菌弹）。他谈的时候好像我们对细菌战已在进行这件事还一点不知道似的。当我和拉荪把他听到什么样的命令传达描述一番，并告诉他我们自己已接受过特殊任务（投细菌弹任务）时，他吃了一惊。我们谈了一会儿细菌战，谈到细菌战看来是如何可怖。我们怀疑细菌战争是否也和其他种类的战争手段一样，用了一阵之后就不是那样可怖了。我们怀疑下一步原子战是否会被利用，我们希望不会。我们一致认为负责下令发动细菌战的人这样做一定有他的充分理由。在同一座屋子里另外还有三个人——一个上尉（驾驶员，当史丹来的飞机被击落时，他是同机的驾驶员），一个少校驾驶员，这个人史密德很熟悉（这两个人那时都还没有开始飞行任务）。另外还有一个中尉领航员，他在细菌战开始之前已完成了五十五次任务。这几个人的名字我都记不得了。
    只在我们接受投细菌弹的任务时，我们的飞机才有警卫。平常的任务是从来不用卫兵的。我确信这些卫兵是属于基地空军警察中队的，他们是士兵，我不认识他们，所以我不能十分肯定他们是属于基地空军警察中队的。
