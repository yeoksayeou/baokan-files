Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 25th: Special correspondent Shen Jiantu reports: On April 10th, American troops on Geoje Island killed and wounded sixty prisoners of war. This is the latest revealed ugly secret of the American "screening." This secret was hidden from the world for forty-four days, and was only revealed by an American inspector after the American chief representative Harrison suggested a recess in the truce talks in order to avoid public attention.

The deaths and injuries of these prisoners of war occurred during the fifteen-day recess of the secret meeting on prisoner of war issues held by staff officers, when the US military forcibly moved the prisoners of war from Geoje Island to create a "fait accompli," proving that the prisoners of war were unwilling to return home.

Up to now, according to enemy news agencies, the number of prisoner of war deaths and injuries caused by the so-called "screening" in the atrocities of February 18th, March 13th, May 17th, and May 20th totaled 391 of our captured personnel. In addition, according to a recent Associated Press report that was suppressed, on April 10th, the US side carried out another massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island, resulting in 60 casualties. However, according to a Reuters report on May 24th, in the April 10th atrocity, 30 of our captured personnel were killed and 57 were injured. This is only what has been revealed by enemy news agencies, and there must be more ugly secrets that have not been revealed!

Bonner's "elite troops" are accelerating their efforts to erase the traces of the massacre on the island. American officers on the island admitted that they only had time to drag away three of the thirty bodies of those who died in the April 10th massacre. They "believe" that the remaining twenty-seven corpses are still buried in the prisoner of war camp grounds that American flamethrower tanks and paratroopers are preparing to occupy. Civilians who witnessed the crimes of the US military have been moved off the island.

The course of this massacre of prisoners of war is as follows:

After the massacre on February 18th, the American General Dodd, who was then the commander of this island of terror, told reporters on February 27th: "We want to know if they want to leave that camp and tell us freely: who are they loyal to?"

Two weeks later, thirty-eight prisoners of war on the island were killed or wounded. Three weeks later, "right in front of Dodd's eyes," three more prisoners of war died and fifty-seven were injured.

Three days later, on April 13th, under the protection of a tight news blockade on these massacres, Ridgway announced to the world in Tokyo the American "concept of the value of human life." In order to apply this American "concept of the value of human life," on May 17th, a Chinese prisoner of war on Geoje Island was shot and killed by an American guard; on May 20th, eighty-six prisoners of war in Busan were killed or wounded; on May 23rd, Bonner issued a public statement telling the world what he was prepared to do. "Remember... he will use force to exercise his jurisdiction."

This is the trace of human life and blood that has been revealed from the news blockade and strict censorship, telling the world the resistance of those who would rather die than live a life of long exile and enslavement in the hands of the enemies they had fought against. After the American guns and bayonets created this massacre and bloodshed, American hypocrisy was even more thoroughly exposed.

    美方强迫甄别不断制造流血事件
    四月十日侵朝美军竟在巨济岛杀伤我方被俘人员数十名
    【新华社开城二十五日电】本社特派记者沈建图报道：四月十日，巨济岛上的美国军队还打死和打伤了六十个战俘。这是最近透露的美国“甄别”的丑恶的秘密。这个秘密在世人面前隐瞒了四十四天，在美国首席代表哈利逊为了躲过公众的耳目而建议停战谈判休会以后才由美国检查官透露出来。
    这些战俘的死伤，发生在参谋人员举行的关于战俘问题的秘密会议休会十五天的期间，当时，美军强迫把战俘们从巨济岛上迁走，以造成“既成事实”，证明战俘们不愿意回家。
    到现在为止，由于所谓“甄别”而造成的战俘死伤数字仅据敌方通讯社所透露的，在二月十八日、三月十三日、五月十七日、五月二十日的数次暴行中，伤亡我被俘人员共达三百九十一名。此外，据美联社最近所透露的被扣压的消息报道称，四月十日美方曾在巨济岛另一次屠杀我方被俘人员，伤亡达六十人。但据路透社五月二十四日报道，在四月十日的暴行中，我方被俘人员被杀害者达三十人，受伤者达五十七人。这仅是敌方通讯社所透露的，一定还有更多丑恶的秘密没有透露出来！
    波纳的“精锐部队”已经在加速努力地掩灭岛上的屠杀痕迹。岛上的美国军官承认他们只来得及拖走在四月十日大屠杀中牺牲的三十个尸体中的三个。他们“相信”留下的二十七副尸体还埋葬在美国喷火坦克和伞兵准备予以占领的战俘营营场里面。目击美军罪行的平民已被迁出岛外。
    这次屠杀战俘事件的经过如下：
    二月十八日的屠杀事件后，那时担任这个恐怖之岛的长官的美国将军杜德于二月二十七日向新闻记者说：“我们要知道，他们是不是想离开那个营场，并且不受拘束地告诉我们：他们究竟是忠于谁。”
    两个星期之后，岛上有三十八个战俘被杀害或打伤。又过了三个星期，“就在杜德的眼面前”又有三个战俘死去，五十七人受伤。
    三天后，即四月十三日，李奇微在对这些屠杀事件的严密新闻封锁的保护之下，在东京向全世界宣布美国的“人类生命价值的观念”。为了运用这个美国的“人类生命价值的观念”，五月十七日，巨济岛有一个中国战俘被美国看守兵枪杀了；五月二十日，釜山八十六个战俘被杀死或击伤了；五月二十三日，波纳发表公报告诉全世界他预备作些什么。“请记住……他要用武力来行使他的管辖权。”
    这就是从新闻封锁与严密的新闻检查下透露出来的人类生命和鲜血的痕迹，它把那些宁死也不愿在他们曾与之战斗的敌人手里过长期流落与受奴役的生活的人们所进行的反抗告诉了全世界。在美国的枪炮与刺刀造成了这种屠杀与流血事件之后，美国的伪善也就更加暴露得彻底。
