    Introduction to the Exhibition of Indian Art
    Zheng Zhenduo
    The history of Indian art is long and its achievements are great. As early as the third century BC, there were exquisite sculptures. The stone lions on the pillars built by King Ashoka are vivid and powerful. Several murals from around the second century BC preserved in the Ajanta caves are still radiant. Hindu and Buddhist art had a great influence in the East. Many grotto temples carved in China since the fourth century AD have distinctly Indian styles in their sculptures and murals. After Islam was introduced to India, Indian art developed new styles. European art and Chinese art have also made some contributions to modern Indian art. The art history of India is indeed extraordinary and glorious. Now the Indian art exhibition will be touring China. We are very happy to have the opportunity to see such rich and beautiful ancient and modern Indian artworks. We should first thank the Indian government, the Indian Embassy in China, and the All-India Fine Arts and Crafts Society, which initiated and organized this exhibition! This exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part is the works of famous modern Indian painters, a total of 280 pieces. This is the main part. Here, we see various schools and styles in the modern Indian art scene. But within these different schools and styles, we see a common point, that is, a strong Indian national form and excellent tradition. Their works are of great achievement. The second part is color reproductions of ancient and modern Indian paintings, a total of 94 pieces. From the famous murals in the Ajanta caves and the paintings of Mongolia to the works of many important modern painters, there are representative works. Looking at this part is like reading a concise history of Indian painting. The third part is photographs, a total of 139 pieces. This part includes Indian architecture from various periods, portraits of famous painters, poets, musicians, landscapes, people's lives, ancient and modern sculptures, and arts and crafts. Here, we come into contact with the vast field of Indian art. China and India are adjacent to each other, and have always coexisted peacefully in history. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendly relations between China and India have been further enhanced. With the enhancement of friendly relations, the cultural and artistic exchanges between China and India have become more frequent and important. Last winter, the Chinese cultural delegation visited India and held Chinese cultural and art exhibitions in various parts of India. Now, the Indian art exhibition and the Indian cultural delegation have arrived in China at the same time and will be exhibited in various places. This symbolizes how much the people of China and India need to achieve mutual understanding and enhance friendship through cultural and artistic exchanges. We believe that through these exhibitions, the friendship between the people of China and India will surely develop and consolidate day by day.
    I wish the Indian art exhibition a success!
    Long live China-India friendship!

    印度艺术展览介绍
    郑振铎
    印度艺术的历史是悠久的，其成就是伟大的。在公元前三世纪的时候，就有了很精美的雕刻。阿育王所建石柱上的石狮，是生动而有力的。保存在阿旃他石洞里的公元前二世纪左右的几幅壁画，至今还神彩奕奕。印度教和佛教的艺术，在东方产生过很大的影响。中国在公元四世纪以来所开凿的许多石窟寺院，其雕刻和壁画是显著的有印度作风的。伊斯兰教传入印度后，印度艺术又产生了新的风格。欧洲艺术和中国艺术，在近代印度艺术上，也有了若干的贡献。印度的一部艺术史，实在是不平凡，而且是很光辉的。现在印度艺术展览就要在中国各地巡回展出。我们很高兴能够有机会看到那末丰富而美丽的印度古代和现代的艺术作品。我们应该在这里首先向发起和主办这个展览的印度政府和印度驻中国大使馆与筹备这个展览的全印美术工艺协会致谢！这个展览，分三大部分。第一部分是印度现代著名画家们的作品，凡二百八十点。这是主要的部分。在这里，我们看到现代印度画坛的各种不同的派别和作风。但在不同的派别和作风里，我们却看到一个共同点，那就是很浓厚的印度的民族形式和优良的传统。他们的作品的成就是很大的。第二部分是印度古代和近代的绘画的彩色复制品，凡九十四点。从著名的阿旃他石洞的壁画，蒙几儿的绘画，到近代许多重要画家们的作品，都有代表作。我们看到这一部分，就像读到一部简明扼要的印度绘画史。第三部分是照片，凡一百三十九点。这部分包括着印度各时代的建筑，著名的画家、诗人、音乐家等的造象，各地风光，人民生活，古代和近代的雕刻，以及美术工艺品等。在这里，我们接触到印度艺术的广大的园地。中、印两国国境相邻，在历史上向来是和平相处。中华人民共和国成立以来，中、印两国之间的友好关系更为增进。随着友好关系的增进，中、印两国之间的文化艺术的交流也日益频繁而显得重要。去年冬天，中国文化代表团访问印度，曾在印度各地举办了中国文化艺术展览。现在，印度艺术展览又和印度文化代表团同时到达了中国，就要在各地展出。这象征着中、印两国人民之间是如何地需要通过文化艺术的交流，而达到互相了解和增进友谊的目的。我们相信，通过了这些展览，中、印两国人民之间的友谊一定会日益发展和巩固的。
    敬祝印度艺术展览成功！
    中、印友好万岁！
