    Cadres in Beicun, Datong County, Should Correct Their Erroneous Attitude Toward Preferential Treatment Work

    Comrade Editor: It is right for some revolutionary soldiers to save their allowances and send them home to subsidize their living expenses. However, some local cadres (especially a few village cadres) think this means they are "earning big money," and therefore do not provide necessary care for military families lacking labor. For example, Comrade Jiu Xushan from my unit, his home is in Beicun, Eighth District, Datong County, Chahar Province. His family consists only of his old mother in her sixties and a younger sister in her teens. He saves his monthly allowance to help his family solve their difficulties. The local village cadres then said to his mother, "Your son is earning big money outside, why should we still give preferential treatment?" After his mother came to our unit to explain this situation, the unit wrote a letter of certification to the local district people's government. However, this not only had no effect, but the local village cadres instead said that Jiu Xushan's mother had "sued" them and provided even less care.

    I believe this attitude towards preferential treatment work is wrong, and I suggest that relevant departments quickly investigate and correct it.
                                                                                                                    Yi Bu

    大同县北村干部应该纠正对待优抚工作的错误态度
    编辑同志：有的革命军人常常把自己的津贴积攒起来，寄给家庭，补助生活费用，这是对的。但是，有的地方干部（特别是少数村干部）却认为这是“挣上大钱”啦，因而对缺乏劳动力的军属也不给以必要的照顾。如我部咎旭山同志，他家在察哈尔省大同县八区北村。他家只有六十多岁的老母亲和一个十多岁的小妹妹。他每月把自己的津贴省下来帮助家中解决困难。当地村干部就对他母亲说：“你儿在外边挣大钱啦，还用优待吗？”他母亲来我们部队说明这种情况后，部队方面就给当地区人民政府写了证明信。但是，这不但没有发生效果，当地村干部反而说咎旭山同志的母亲“告了”他们，更不照顾了。
    我认为这种对待优抚工作的态度是错误的，我建议有关方面迅速检查纠正。    一卜
