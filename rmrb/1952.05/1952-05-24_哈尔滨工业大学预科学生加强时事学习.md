    Harbin Institute of Technology Preparatory Students Strengthen Current Affairs Study
    Editor: The preparatory students of Harbin Institute of Technology in Northeast China have universally established newspaper reading groups since the beginning of this semester, regularly study newspapers, and conduct current affairs broadcasts twice a week. However, we recently held a current affairs quiz and found that the students' current affairs learning effectiveness is still very poor. For example, some students said: "'Five-Anti' is 'Three-Anti' plus 'Two-Anti' – tax evasion and tax avoidance." "'Five-Anti' is conducted in financial departments, and 'Three-Anti' is an attack on petty-bourgeois ideology." In terms of international issues, the confused and incorrect thoughts exposed by the students are even more serious.
    The student union has paid close attention to this phenomenon, announced the results of this quiz to all students, and jointly studied ways to correct this phenomenon with the newspaper reading groups. The measures stipulated are: (1) Strengthen current affairs broadcasts and require all students to listen carefully; (2) Promote the experience of good newspaper reading groups in conducting newspaper study; (3) Comprehensively understand the newspaper reading study situation in each class, provide specific assistance to each, and prepare to cultivate a typical class with good newspaper reading to promote current affairs study throughout the school; (4) Hold current affairs quizzes regularly.
    The students were greatly educated by this quiz, and many classes discussed the issue of understanding current affairs study in groups. The blackboard newspapers of each class also published and discussed this issue. After this quiz, the current affairs study situation has improved compared to before.

    哈尔滨工业大学预科学生加强时事学习
    编辑同志：东北哈尔滨工业大学预科的学生，从这一学期开始，普遍地建立了读报组，经常学习报纸，每周并进行两次时事广播。但最近我们举行了一次时事测验，发现同学们的时事学习效果还很差。如有些同学说：“‘五反’是‘三反’加‘两反’——偷税、漏税。”“‘五反’是在财经部门进行的，‘三反’是向小资产阶级思想进攻的”。在国际问题方面，同学们暴露的糊涂思想和错误思想更严重。
    学生会对于这种现象十分注意，曾把这次测验结果向全体同学宣布，并和读报组共同研究了纠正这种现象的办法。规定：（一）加强时事广播，要求全体同学认真收听；（二）推广好的读报组进行读报学习的经验；（三）全面地了解各班的读报学习情况，分别给以具体帮助，并准备培养一个读报好的典型班，以推动全校的时事学习；（四）定期举行时事测验。
    同学们从这次测验中都受到极大的教育，许多班都以小组为单位，讨论了对时事学习的认识问题。各班的黑板报也都刊载和讨论了这方面的问题。经过这次测验，时事学习情况较前已有改善。
