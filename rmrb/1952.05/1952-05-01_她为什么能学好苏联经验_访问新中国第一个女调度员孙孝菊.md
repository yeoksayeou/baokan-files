　　Why She Can Learn Soviet Experience Well
    ——An Interview with Sun Xiaoju, the First Female Dispatcher in New China
    Sun Xiaoju, the first female dispatcher in New China, is a model for learning advanced Soviet experience. She works in the Traffic Section of the Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau in Northeast China. By adopting the Soviet experience – the "Zagorko Dispatching Method" – she has opened up a new path for railway dispatching work in our country. With the intention of learning from her, I interviewed her. I learned that the reason she can learn Soviet experience well lies in her firm belief in the superiority of Soviet experience and her conscientious integration of advanced Soviet experience with her own practice.
    She began her dispatching work in April last year. She heard people say that the "Zagorko Dispatching Method" was the most advanced working method, and at that time she thought: "Minister Teng Daiyuan often calls on us to learn from Soviet experience and run the Chinese People's Railways well. Now is the time for me to act." She borrowed a book on the "Zagorko Dispatching Method" from the dispatching director and studied it every day. After studying more than ten chapters, she discovered that the main spirit of the "Zagorko Dispatching Method" is: be familiar with the situation, grasp the situation; understand the masses, rely on the masses. She told her understanding to the dispatching director Zhu Yongxiang. Zhu Yongxiang did not answer definitely; she went to other dispatchers, and the dispatcher Zheng Baolin ridiculed her, saying: "You, a female comrade, have just started dispatching work and are already talking about advanced experience!"
    Sun Xiaoju was not discouraged. According to the spirit of the "Zagorko Dispatching Method," she often went outside to understand the situation. She paid close attention to the thirty-odd stations she was in charge of. During her days off, she often went to the stations and talked with the station personnel to understand all the equipment capabilities of the stations and ask them for their opinions on the dispatching work. Sometimes, she took the initiative to ride freight trains to see the situation and problems in the transportation of freight cars. She often discussed with the drivers how to maximize the traction capacity of locomotives. The dispatchers who worked with her were surprised by her approach. Because it was never necessary for dispatchers to personally understand the situation of these departments, let alone discuss dispatching issues with these departments. Once, the dispatcher Zheng Baolin mocked her again: "We can still work without going out to understand the situation." After hearing this, she said very modestly: "I just started this job, and I can't do it without being familiar with the situation!" Then she asked Zheng Baolin: "How high is the slope from Xintun to Yian?" Zheng Baolin could not answer. She asked again: "Which bridges require slow driving?" Zheng Baolin could not answer again. She said: "We dispatchers are like commanders in the army. How can we win battles if we don't understand the enemy's situation?" Because of her enlightenment, Zheng Baolin realized his past mistakes and began to learn from Sun Xiaoju's approach.
    Sun Xiaoju heard that the higher authorities were calling on railway workers across the country to launch the "Over-Axle" movement, so she analyzed the situation of the Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau. She found that the slope between Xintun and Yian was the most difficult place to pull more cars; she thought that if this place was broken through, "Over-Axle" could be implemented. She personally went to this area to inspect and discussed it with driver Ma Hongtao. She knew that Ma Hongtao had a high political consciousness, was not conservative, and had an enterprising spirit. She asked Ma Hongtao: "Do you think it is possible to pull more in this area?" Ma Hongtao replied: "Yes!" Based on this situation, Sun Xiaoju proposed to pull more cars in this area. The dispatcher Guan Xifu objected: "In the past, we pulled 1,700 tons, which was already difficult enough. Can we pull more?" Sun Xiaoju carefully analyzed the situation in this area to him and analyzed the capabilities of the train drivers. Guan Xifu had no reason to refute, so he had to agree to her proposal. Driver Ma Hongtao took the initiative to accept the task of driving the locomotive, pulling 2,550 tons, and finally safely passed through this area, and ran four minutes faster. This fact powerfully broke the conservative ideology. Today, drivers can "Over-Axle" in this area, and some drivers can "Over-Axle" to pull more than 3,000 tons at a time.
    When Sun Xiaoju talked to me about these facts, she summarized and said: "The reason I can learn the 'Zagorko Dispatching Method' is because I can 'know the enemy and know myself,' and then I can 'win every battle.'" As she spoke, she described the various situations of the entire Qiqihar Railway Sub-bureau like flowing water. Because she understands the situation so well, she can complete all the work plans she makes, and none of the dispatching orders she issues have failed. From understanding the situation of various departments, she increasingly realized that any department of a railway enterprise cannot be isolated and must be closely integrated into a whole. Starting from this overall concept, and referring to the "Zagorko Dispatching Method," she generally signed contact contracts with stations and locomotive depots. In April this year, she signed more than 200 contracts with various departments, shortened the train stay time, and pulled more goods, thus saving the country more than 150 million yuan. Her model deeds of learning from Soviet experience have spread throughout the dispatching departments of the Northeast Railway, and dispatching workers are learning from her.

　　她为什么能学好苏联经验
    ——访问新中国第一个女调度员孙孝菊
    新中国第一个女调度员孙孝菊是一个学习苏联先进经验的模范。她在东北齐齐哈尔铁路分局车务科做调度工作，采用了苏联经验——“扎果尔科调度法”，给我国铁路的调度工作开辟了一条新的道路。我怀着向她学习的心情访问了她。我知道了她所以能学好苏联经验，是在于她坚信苏联经验的优越性，认真地把苏联先进经验和自己的实践结合起来了。
    去年四月，她开始做调度工作。她听见人家说，“扎果尔科调度法”是最先进的工作方法，当时她就想：“滕代远部长常常号召我们要好好地学习苏联经验，把中国人民铁路办好。现在该是我行动的时候了。”他从调度主任那里，借了一本讲“扎果尔科调度法”的书，天天学它。学了十多篇，她发现“扎果尔科调度法”的主要精神是：熟悉情况，掌握情况；了解群众，依靠群众。她把自己这个体会，告诉调度主任祝永祥。祝永祥未答可否；她去找其他的调度员，调度员郑宝林讥讽她说：“你这个女同志，刚干调度工作，就谈起什么先进经验来了！”
    孙孝菊没有灰心。她根据“扎果尔科调度法”的精神，常常到外面去了解情况。她对于她所掌握的三十多个车站，都非常注意。在休班的时候，她常常去车站和车站人员谈话，了解车站的一切设备能力，并且询问他们对于调度工作的意见。有时候，她主动地乘坐货车，看看运输货车中的情况和问题。她常常跟司机们讨论如何发挥机车的牵引能力。和她在一起工作的调度员，对于她这种做法感到奇怪。因为从来做调度工作的就不必要亲自去了解这些部门的情况，更不必要去和这些部门讨论调度工作的问题。有一次，调度员郑宝林又讽刺她：“我们不出去了解情况，我们也一样能工作。”她听了，反而很谦虚地说道：“我刚干这门工作，不熟悉情况可不行！”接着她问郑宝林：“从新屯到衣安之间的坡度有多高？”郑宝林不能答复。她又问：“过那几个大桥要徐行？”郑宝林又不能答复。她说：“我们干调度工作的，就如同军队的指挥官一样，不了解敌情，怎能打胜仗呢？”由于她这样地启发，郑宝林认识了过去的错误看法，开始学习孙孝菊的做法。
    孙孝菊听说上级号召全国铁路职工开展“超轴”运动，她就分析了齐齐哈尔铁路分局的情况。她发现从新屯到衣安之间的坡道是个最不容易多拉车皮的地方；她想，如果突破这个地方，“超轴”就能实行了。她亲自跑到这个地区察看，并且找司机马洪滔商量。她知道马洪滔的政治觉悟高，不保守，有进取心。她就问马洪滔：“你看，在这个地区多拉，行不行？”马洪滔答道：“行！”根据这些情况，孙孝菊就提出了在这个地区多拉车的主张。调度员关喜福反对：“过去我们拉一千七百吨，已经够呛了，还能再多拉吗？”孙孝菊仔细地向他分析了这个地区的状况，分析了驾驶机车的乘务员的能力。关喜福没有理由反驳，就只好同意了她的主张。司机马洪滔主动地接受了这个任务来驾驶机车，牵引了二千五百五十吨，终于很安全地驶过了这个地区，而且快跑了四分钟。这个事实，有力地打破了保守思想。今天司机们都能在这个地区“超轴”了，有些司机一次能“超轴”牵引三千多吨。
    当孙孝菊和我谈到这些事实时，她像总结似地说道：“我能学习‘扎果尔科调度法’的道理；因为我能‘知彼知己’，就能‘百战百胜’。”她一面谈，一面像流水似地叙述着整个齐齐哈尔铁路分局的各种情况。因为她这样地了解情况，她每次订的工作计划都能全部完成，她发出任何一个调度命令都没有落过空。从了解各部门情况中，她越发体会到铁路企业任何部门都是不能孤立的，必须密切地结成一个整体。她从这个整体观念出发，参照了“扎果尔科调度法”，普遍地和车站、机务段订立了联系合同。今年四月份，她和各部门订立了二百多次合同，缩短了列车的停留时间，多牵引了货物，因之给国家节省了一亿五千多万元。她这种学习苏联经验的模范事迹，已经传遍了东北铁路的调度部门，调度工作者都正在向她学习。  （陈迹）（附图片）
