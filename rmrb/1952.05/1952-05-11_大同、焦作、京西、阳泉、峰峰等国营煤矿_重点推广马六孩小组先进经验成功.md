The key promotion of the Ma Liuhai Team's multi-tunnel rapid tunneling method in state-owned coal mines in North China, such as Datong, Jiaozuo, Jingxi, Yangquan, and Fengfeng, has been successful. After the key teams in these coal mines tried the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team, they increased their tunneling efficiency several times over; and it has been proven that the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team can be adopted under various different production conditions. If the state-owned coal mines in North China can universally promote this advanced experience and reach the average tunneling efficiency of these teams before April 20, they will be able to increase production and save more than 10,000 tons of rice worth of wealth for the country; the problem of tunneling not keeping up with coal mining will also be solved.

In January of this year, the North China Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union convened a representative meeting of rapid tunneling workers from state-owned coal mines in North China to summarize and promote the experience of Ma Liuhai's multi-tunnel rapid tunneling; subsequently, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry issued instructions to effectively promote the tunneling experience of the Ma Liuhai Team. Since then, coal mines in North China have begun to focus on promoting this advanced experience. In March, the North China Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union formed four working groups and went to mines in Jingxi, Yangquan, Fengfeng, and Jiaozuo to help promote it. Now, the key promotion teams have all achieved good results.

The three teams of Zhao You, Liu Shouren, and Liu Yutong from the Datong Mining Bureau further studied the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team and implemented the "circular production chart system," which made the allocation of labor reasonable, various types of work closely coordinated, and accurately grasped and utilized production time; at the same time, they implemented the "deep-hole operation method," which increased the depth of each tunneling from 1.1 meters to 1.7 meters, giving full play to the efficiency of machinery and explosives, thus continuously improving tunneling efficiency. In a roadway 3 meters wide and 1.5 meters high, the Liu Shouren team tunneled a total of 351.25 meters in eighteen working days, with an average progress of 2.22 meters per shift. The Zhao You and Liu Yutong teams also exceeded their quotas by 50 to 75 percent.

The Liu Jiuxue tunneling team of the Lifeng Mine of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau conscientiously studied the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team, making it suitable for different geological conditions and different coal seams. The tunneling efficiency of the Liu Jiuxue tunneling team has been increased by 15.3 percent on the original basis, and the project is guaranteed to meet specifications. The Xu Nuo team of the Wangfeng Mine, after learning the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team, created a new record of 28 meters per shift (the general tunneling efficiency in the past was only 7.5 meters).

The 12th and 3rd teams of the Chengzi Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau have already made great achievements in learning from the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team and have challenged the Ma Liuhai Team. In the past, the 12th team averaged 5.4 meters of tunneling per day; after learning from the experience of the Ma Liuhai Team, the average tunneling efficiency in March was 11.9 meters, and a new record of 21.8 meters per day was created. The workers said, "If the coal cars can be supplied, we guarantee to tunnel more than 15 meters per day." After challenging the Ma Liuhai Team, all the workers of the 3rd team created a new record of 27.5 meters per day on April 25.

The Wang Jinxiang team of the Second Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau achieved a tunneling efficiency of 16.5 meters in roadways that were 3.4 meters wide at the top and 4.4 meters wide at the bottom, and 2 meters high for the main roadway, and 2.9 meters wide at the top and 3.9 meters wide at the bottom, and 2 meters high for the auxiliary roadway (the tunneling efficiency in the past was generally between 4 meters and 6.5 meters). After successful experimentation, the Li Taibao team of the Fourth Mine set a plan to tunnel 300 meters per month and increase production and save more than 184,000 jin of rice for the whole year. These two teams have also challenged the Ma Liuhai Team.

The experimental promotion work of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau has also been successful. In the process of experimental promotion, all mines have paid attention to conducting necessary education for workers and criticizing incorrect ideas such as conservatism and complacency at any time; at the same time, they have paid attention to contacting and cooperating with various relevant departments. However, the problem of mutual cooperation has not been well resolved at present, and sometimes work is suspended due to lack of material supply; or the achieved tunneling records cannot be maintained regularly due to insufficient transportation capacity.

There are also individual coal mines, such as the Fangshan East Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, that do not pay enough attention to the promotion work, and the safety work is very poor, resulting in casualties in the promotion. The three drilling and blasting workers they equipped were not skilled, and violated the safety operating procedures, instructing the three workers to drill twelve holes per shift (safety operating procedures stipulate that one person shall not fire more than three shots at a time). As a result, because the ignition time was too long, and the workers ignited the fuse before loading the explosives (this is what the general workers in this mine do, and the relevant responsible cadres have not paid attention to it), the workers could not avoid after the blasting, resulting in a serious accident in which one person died and two were seriously injured, and the promotion work was greatly hindered. The leading cadres of the mine should conduct a profound review.

    大同、焦作、京西、阳泉、峰峰等国营煤矿
    重点推广马六孩小组先进经验成功
    华北区大同、焦作、京西、阳泉、峰峰等国营煤矿重点推广马六孩小组多孔道快速掘进工作法已经成功。这些煤矿的重点小组在试用了马六孩小组的经验后，都数以倍计地提高了自己的掘进效率；并证明了在各种不同的生产条件下，都可以采用马六孩小组的经验。如果华北各国营煤矿能够普遍推广这个先进经验，并达到这几个小组在四月二十日前的平均掘进效率，将可为国家增产节约一万吨米以上的财富；掘进赶不上采煤的问题，也将随之解决。
    今年一月，煤矿工会华北区委员会召开了华北国营煤矿快速掘进工人代表会议，总结和推广了马六孩多孔道快速掘进的经验；接着，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局发出了切实推广马六孩小组掘进经验的指示。从那时起，华北各煤矿就开始重点推广这个先进经验。煤矿工会华北区委员会在三月份先后组成四个工作组，分赴京西、阳泉、峰峰、焦作等矿帮助推广。现在，重点推广的小组都已收到很好的效果。
    大同矿务局赵有、刘守仁、刘玉桐三个小组，进一步学习了马六孩小组的经验，实行了“循环生产图表制”，使劳动力配备合理，各种工种紧密配合，精确地掌握、运用生产时间；同时，实行了“深孔作业法”，使每次掘进深度由一公尺十公分增加到一公尺七十公分，充分发挥了机械和炮药的效力，因而连续提高了掘进效率。刘守仁小组在三公尺宽、一公尺五十公分高的巷道里，十八个工作日共掘进三百五十一公尺二十五公分，平均每工进度二公尺二十二公分。赵有、刘玉桐小组也都超额百分之五十到七十五。
    焦作矿务局李封矿刘九学掘进大队认真学习了马六孩小组的经验，使之适合于不同地质和不同煤层。刘九学掘进大队的掘进效率已经在原有的基础上提高了百分之十五点三，并且保证工程合乎规格。王封矿许诺小组，学习马六孩小组的经验后，创造了一个圆班进二十八公尺的新纪录（过去一般的掘进效率只有七点五公尺）。
    京西矿务局城子矿十二组和三组学习马六孩小组经验已经有了很好的成就，并且向马六孩小组应了战。十二组过去平均每天掘进五点四公尺；学习马六孩小组经验后，三月份平均掘进效率为十一点九公尺，并曾创造了日进二十一点八公尺的新纪录。工人们说：“如果煤车能够供给得上，保证每天掘进十五公尺以上。”三组的全体工人在向马六孩小组应战后，四月二十五日创造了日进二十七点五公尺的新纪录。
    阳泉矿务局二矿王金祥小组，在正巷上宽三点四公尺、下宽四点四公尺、高二公尺，副巷上宽二点九公尺、下宽三点九公尺、高二公尺的巷道中，掘进效率达到十六点五公尺（过去掘进效率一般在四公尺至六点五公尺之间）。四矿李太保小组试验成功后，定出了每月掘进三百公尺和全年增产节约十八万四千多斤米的计划。这两个小组也都已向马六孩小组应了战。
    峰峰矿务局的试验推广工作也已成功。在试验推广中间，各矿都注意了对工人进行必要的教育，随时批判保守自满等不正确思想；同时，注意了和各有关部门联系配合。但是，互相配合的问题，目前还没有很好地解决，有时还因为材料供应不上而停工待料；或者因运搬力量不足，使已经达到的掘进纪录不能经常保持。
    也还有个别煤矿，如京西矿务局的房山东矿，对推广工作很不重视，加以安全工作做得很差，以致在推广中发生伤亡事故。他们配备的三个打眼放炮的工人技术都不熟练，并且违犯安全操作规程，指示三个工人每茬打十二个眼（安全操作规程规定一人一次放炮不得超过三个）。结果因为点炮时间过长，加上工人放炮时先点捻后装药（这个矿一般工人都是这样做，有关的负责干部竟一直没有注意），以致放炮后工人不能躲避，造成一人死亡二人重伤的严重事故，推广工作受到很大阻碍。该矿的领导干部应该进行深刻的检讨。
