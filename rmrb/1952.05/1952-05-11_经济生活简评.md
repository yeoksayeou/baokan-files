Economic Life Brief Commentary

Departing from the Masses and Reality Inevitably Leads to Setbacks

The "1951 Weaving Method" was summarized at the National Weaving Method Conference held in November last year. It is a concentrated expression of the advanced operational experience and theoretical knowledge of outstanding weaving workers, technicians, engineers, and experts from Qingdao, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Northeast China, produced after experimentation, observation, measurement, analysis, and discussion. It is a concentrated representation of the advantages of weaving technology of Chinese textile workers, and a great creation of the masses of Chinese textile industry workers. Since the "1951 Weaving Method" has been promoted in cotton textile factories across the country, both output and quality have improved, fully demonstrating the superiority of this advanced working method.

The workers of the State-owned Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory, like other textile workers, warmly welcomed the "1951 Weaving Method." Between December of last year and January of this year, thanks to the workers' diligent study and the direct assistance of the promotion team composed of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Textile Workers' Union and the Municipal Textile Management Bureau, most of the weaving workers learned the "1951 Weaving Method," and the results were very good. The second-grade cloth rate decreased from an average of 6.51 percent before the promotion to about 1 percent; the output increased from an average of 42.82 yards per machine per ten hours before the promotion to 43.51 yards. These facts clearly show that if we want to develop production and truly get rid of backward production methods, we can only concentrate the wisdom of the masses, give full play to the strength of the masses, and promote advanced operating methods. However, some leading cadres of the Qingdao No. 8 Cotton Textile Factory did not do this; they took a wrong path of detaching themselves from the masses and reality, and as a result, they made a mess of the promotion of advanced experience, and seriously dampened the enthusiasm of workers in creating and learning advanced production experience.

These administrative leading cadres should thoroughly examine their erroneous thinking during the construction stage of the "Three-Anti" movement and immediately formulate a specific plan for promoting the "1951 Weaving Method." The Party Committee and the Trade Union should also overcome the shortcomings of not paying enough attention to the promotion of advanced experience in the past, and assist and supervise the administrative leading cadres to effectively promote the "1951 Weaving Method."

Enterprise Leading Cadres Should Be Responsible for All Accidents

On April 13th, a serious casualty accident occurred in the No. 6 West Lane of the Fangshan East Mine, affiliated to the Jingxi Mining Bureau, where the advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai group was being implemented, resulting in the death of one worker and serious injuries to two. After this unfortunate incident, the mine director and security personnel of the Fangshan East Mine did not make any self-criticism at all, but completely pushed the responsibility onto the injured and dead workers, advocating that the injured workers be treated first, and then criticized or punished. Their reason was that the workers violated the safety regulations, thus causing the accident. In fact, it was the leading cadres and security personnel of the Fangshan East Mine who did not pay attention to the safety regulations or even violated them. The safety regulations stipulate that each worker should not fire more than three shots each time. However, when promoting the experience of the Ma Liuhai group, they assigned three workers to drill and fire, instructing them to fire twelve shots each time, which means that each person had to fire at least four shots each time. Should this responsibility be borne by the workers? As for the workers igniting the fuse before loading the explosives, this was indeed a violation of the operating procedures. However, at that time, the workers in the mine were still generally using this unreasonable operating method left over from the enemy and puppet rule, but no one educated them to correct it. After the accident, someone questioned the leading cadres as to why they had not discovered and corrected this phenomenon, and they said "justly and confidently": "Why didn't the workers report it to us?" The bourgeois style of the leading cadres of the Fangshan East Mine, who were not responsible for the lives of the workers, had developed to such an intolerable extent!

Administrative leading cadres and engineering leading cadres at all levels in enterprises must be responsible for all accidents. This point was clearly stipulated in the decision on coal mine safety issues issued by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry in 1950. That is to say, not only when workers violate safety regulations under the instructions of leading cadres and cause accidents, the leading cadres are responsible; even when workers do not understand or neglect safety regulations, make mistakes in operation, and thus cause accidents, the leading cadres are also responsible. Leading cadres should attach great importance to safety work, regularly conduct safety education for workers, and conscientiously conduct safety inspections to avoid various accidents. Leading cadres in socialist enterprises should regard protecting the safety of workers as one of their important responsibilities. Leading cadres neglecting safety work is a serious mistake of principle. This is one of the most important differences between state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature and enterprises of a capitalist nature. The leading cadres of the Fangshan East Mine completely forgot this point. They did not regard safety issues as their responsibility at all. When they were assigning tasks to the workers in April, they only emphasized completing the tasks and did not mention safety issues at all; the phenomenon of violating safety regulations in the Fangshan East Mine was not only igniting the fuse before loading the explosives, but was widespread, but they turned a blind eye to it. Under such circumstances, when an accident occurred and the lives of their class brothers were sacrificed, they did not feel distressed at all, but unreasonably pushed the responsibility completely onto the workers. It has been a long time since the incident occurred, and the leading cadres of the Jingxi Mining Bureau have not urged them to correct their mistakes, which is obviously that they do not pay enough attention to safety issues either. The leading cadres of the Jingxi Mining Bureau and the Fangshan East Mine should conduct serious public self-criticism and thoroughly correct their mistakes.

    经济生活简评
    脱离群众脱离实际必然碰壁
    “一九五一织布工作法”，是去年十一月召开的全国织布工作法会议总结出来的。它是集中了青岛、上海、天津及东北等地的优秀织布工人和技师、工程师、专家的先进操作经验和理论知识，经过试验、观察、测定、分析和讨论后产生的。这是我国纺织工人操作技术的优点的集中表现，是我国纺织业职工群众的伟大的创造。全国各地棉纺织厂推广“一九五一织布工作法”以后，产量质量都提高了，充分显示了这个先进工作法的优越性。
    国营青岛第八棉纺织厂的职工，和其他纺织工人一样，对“一九五一织布工作法”是热烈欢迎的。去年十二月到今年一月间，由于职工的努力学习，和纺织工会青岛市委员会和市纺织管理分局组成的推广组的直接帮助，大部分织布工人都学会了“一九五一织布工作法”，效果很好。次布率由推广前的平均百分之六点五一，降到百分之一左右；产量由推广前每台机器平均十小时产四十二点八二码，增加到四十三点五一码。这些事实，最清楚地说明了：如果要发展生产，真正摆脱落后的生产方法，只有集中群众的智慧，发挥群众的力量，推广先进操作方法。可是，青岛第八棉纺织厂有些领导干部却没有这样做；他们走了一条脱离群众脱离实际的错误道路，结果，把先进经验的推广工作搞得一团糟，而且严重地打击了职工创造和学习先进生产经验的积极性。
    这些行政领导干部应该在“三反”运动建设阶段，彻底检查自己的错误思想，立即作出推广“一九五一织布工作法”的具体计划。党委和工会也应该克服过去不重视先进经验的推广工作的缺点，协助和督促行政领导干部，切实推广“一九五一织布工作法”。
    企业领导干部应对一切责任事故负责
    四月十三日，京西矿务局所属房山东矿试行推广马六孩小组先进经验的六槽西巷，发生了严重的伤亡事故，死工人一人，重伤二人。这个不幸的事件发生后，房山东矿的矿长和保安人员竟然根本不做检讨，把责任完全推到受伤和死亡的工人身上，主张给受伤工人治好伤，然后给以批评或处分。他们的理由是：工人违犯了保安规程，因而酿成事故。事实上不重视保安规程甚至违犯保安规程的，首先是房山东矿的领导干部和保安人员。保安规程规定，每个工人每次放炮不得超过三个。但是推广马六孩小组经验时，他们配备了三个打眼放炮工人，指示他们每茬要放十二个炮，也就是说每人每次至少要放四个炮。这个责任难道应该由工人来负吗？至于工人们先点捻后装药，这确是违犯了操作规程的。但是，当时井下的工人还普遍地沿用着这种敌伪统治时遗留下来的不合理的操作方法，却无人教育他们改正。这次事故发生后，有人责问领导干部为什么没有发现并纠正这种现象，他们竟“理直气壮”地说：“工人为什么不向我们报告呢？”房山东矿领导干部对工人生命不负责任的资产阶级作风竟然发展到这种令人不能容忍的程度！
    企业中的各级行政领导干部和工程领导干部，必须对一切责任事故负责。这一点，中央燃料工业部
    一九五○年发布的关于煤矿保安问题的决定中早有明确的规定。这就是说，不仅是工人在领导干部指示下违犯保安规程酿成事故时，领导干部要负责任；就是工人不懂或忽视保安规程，在操作中发生错误，因而引起事故时，领导干部也是要负责任的。领导干部应当十分重视安全工作，经常地对工人进行安全教育，认真地进行安全检查，以避免各种事故。社会主义性质的企业中的领导干部，应当把保护工人的安全当做自己的重要职责之一。领导干部忽视安全工作，就是犯了严重的原则错误。这一点，正是社会主义性质的国营企业和资本主义性质的企业的最重要的区别之一。房山东矿的领导干部完全忘掉了这一点。他们根本没有把安全问题当成自己的职责。他们在向工人布置四月份的任务时，就只强调完成任务，而根本没有提及安全问题；房山东矿井下违犯保安规程的现象并不只是先点捻后装药这一种，而且是普遍的，他们却都熟视无睹。在这种情况下，发生了事故，牺牲了自己阶级弟兄的生命时，他们还丝毫不感到痛心，反而毫无道理地把责任完全推到工人身上。事情发生了很久，京西矿务局的领导干部也没有督促他们改正错误，显然也是对安全问题不够重视的。京西矿务局和房山东矿的领导干部应该认真进行公开检讨，彻底改正错误。
