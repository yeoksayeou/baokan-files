Xinhua News Agency, 13th: At a time when peace and security in Asia and the Pacific, and indeed the entire world, are repeatedly facing serious threats, and to strengthen unity among the people of Asian and Pacific Rim countries to jointly safeguard peace and prevent plots of new wars of aggression, prominent figures in our country dedicated to the cause of peace, including Song Qingling, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Li Siguang, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Xiruo, Liu Ningyi, Cai Chang, Mao Dun, Liao Chengzhi, and others, eleven in total, jointly sent a telegram on March 21st, inviting prominent figures of peace and justice from Asian and Pacific Rim countries to jointly initiate the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference."

Since the telegram was sent, it has quickly received enthusiastic responses from broad masses of peace-loving people from Pacific Rim countries in Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Many have established preparatory committees in their respective countries to participate in the conference and have nominated individuals who have contributed to, are highly respected in, and are dedicated to the cause of peace in their countries to participate as joint initiators. In order to promote the convening of the conference, with the agreement of the initiators from various countries, it has now been decided that the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will first be held in Beijing on May 28th of this year.

The text of the initiation telegram from the initiators in our country is as follows:

Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference Initiation Document

In the current international situation, safeguarding peace in the Asian and Pacific regions has become an important factor in safeguarding world peace.

Due to the revival of Japanese militarism, accelerated by the one-sided San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan and the recent signing of the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," due to the procrastination and obstruction of the Korean armistice negotiations, and the recent emergence of inhumane bacteriological warfare, and due to the establishment of military bases everywhere in the Asian region by expansionists attempting to dominate the world, preparing to launch new and larger-scale wars of aggression, the security and peace of Asian and Pacific countries are now under serious threat, and the people of the Asian and Pacific regions are facing the danger of being subjected to armed aggression again.

But on the other hand, the broad masses of people in Asian and Pacific countries are eagerly demanding and longing for peace. Like the people of all countries in the world, they feel unusually uneasy about the deteriorating international situation and the threat of war. The wounds of the disasters inflicted on the people of the Asian and Pacific regions by Japanese imperialism in World War II have not yet fully healed, and the painful experiences are still fresh in people's memories. Apart from a few aggressors, no peace-loving people want war, and no kind people do not yearn for peace. This is an important factor that enables the people of the Asian and Pacific regions to eliminate the threat of war and safeguard peace, and it makes us believe that another world war can be avoided.

It must be pointed out that peace cannot wait; peace requires peace-loving people to unite and strive for it. If the people of the Asian and Pacific regions mobilize to strive for peace, then peace in the Asian and Pacific regions can be guaranteed. The solemn tasks before us are: to unite closely against the rearmament of Japan by the United States, to protect the security of the Asian and Pacific regions; to oppose any country interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, to protect the independence and integrity of national sovereignty, and to ensure the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems; to insist on advocating peaceful solutions to existing conflicts, to restore and develop normal trade relations and cultural exchanges between countries.

In view of the above situation, we believe that convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in the near future to broadly exchange views on issues of safeguarding peace interests and seek appropriate measures for joint resolution is of urgent and great significance.

This suggestion was proposed in 1951 by people working for the cause of peace in Asia and the world, and during the gestation process, it received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of peace-loving people in the Asian and Pacific regions, who all unanimously advocated immediate action. Leaders of the peace movement in India even suggested that this conference should be held in Beijing. The Chinese people warmly welcome the convening of this peace-safeguarding conference in Beijing and believe that they have an unshirkable responsibility to immediately jointly initiate it with peace-loving and just people from various countries.

Regarding the convening and preparation of this conference, we would like to submit the following suggestions for consideration:

First, the representatives participating in the conference should mainly be from the Asian and Pacific regions, and the scope of representation should be as broad as possible, regardless of race, class, religious belief, or different political views. All people who advocate peace and oppose war should be welcomed (including scientists, educators, writers, scholars, professors, artists, journalists, trade union leaders, peasant movement leaders, youth, students, women leaders, peace movement workers, and other peace-loving people).

Second, each country in the Asian and Pacific regions should nominate individuals who have contributed to, are highly respected in, and are sincerely dedicated to the cause of peace in their countries to participate as joint initiators of this conference. The initiators of the People's Republic of China have been nominated as Song Qingling, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, Li Siguang, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Xiruo, Liu Ningyi, Cai Chang, Mao Dun, Liao Chengzhi, and eleven others. We hope that your country can participate as joint initiators and please telegraph us the list of joint initiators by early April of this year.

Third, each country in the Asian and Pacific regions should immediately establish its own preparatory committee to carry out the preparatory work for participating in the conference and widely publicize the great significance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to increase the understanding of the broad masses of people. The Preparatory Committee of the People's Republic of China for participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has been established, with Liu Ningyi, Liao Chengzhi, and Liu Guanyi responsible. Please maintain regular contact with them.

Fourth, convene a preparatory meeting in Beijing at an appropriate time. We hope that your country will nominate representatives to attend and participate. We hope that you will notify Liu Ningyi of the list of representatives from your country who will participate in the preparatory meeting by early April of this year.

We are eagerly awaiting your opinions and replies to our initiative and suggestions as soon as possible.

Guo Moruo (Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression)

    宋庆龄郭沫若等联名电邀各国爱好和平正义人士
    共同发起亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    亚、澳、美各洲太平洋沿岸各国广大爱好和平人士表示热烈响应
    和平会议的筹备会议定今年五月二十八日在我国首都北京举行
    【新华社十三日讯】正当亚洲及太平洋和全世界的和平与安全一再受到严重威胁之际，为了亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民加强团结，共同努力保卫和平及制止新侵略战争的阴谋，我国努力和平事业的著名人士宋庆龄、郭沫若、彭真、陈叔通、李四光、马寅初、张奚若、刘宁一、蔡畅、茅盾、廖承志等十一人，于三月二十一日联名发电邀请亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平与正义的著名人士，共同发起“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”。
    自电文发出后，已迅速得到亚、澳、美各洲太平洋沿岸各国广大爱好和平人士的热烈响应，纷纷成立了本国参加大会的筹备委员会，推定了本国对和平事业有贡献有声望及爱好和平的人士参加联名发起。为了促进大会的召开，经各国发起人同意，现已决定于本年五月二十八日在北京首先举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议。
    我国发起人的发起电文如下：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议发起书
    在目前的国际局势之下，保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平已成为保卫世界和平的重要因素。
    由于旧金山片面对日和约、及最近美、日“行政协定”的签订而加速的日本军国主义的复活，由于朝鲜停战谈判被拖延和阻挠，最近并有违反人道的细菌战出现，由于企图独霸世界的扩张主义者在亚洲区域到处建立军事基地，准备发动新的更大规模的侵略战争，因而亚洲及太平洋各国的安全与和平现已遭受到严重的威胁，亚洲及太平洋区域的人民已面临重新遭受武装侵略的危险。
    但在另一方面，亚洲及太平洋区域各国的广大人民是热切地要求并渴望着和平的。正如世界各国的人民一样，他们对恶化的国际局势和战争的威胁感到异常的不安。日本帝国主义在第二次世界大战中所给亚洲及太平洋区域人民灾难的创伤尚未完全恢复，惨痛的经验在人们中记忆犹新，除了少数侵略者，没有任何爱好和平的人民愿意战争，没有任何善良的人民不渴望和平。这就是亚洲及太平洋地区人民能够消除战争威胁和保卫和平的重要因素，这也就使我们相信另一次世界战争是可以避免的。
    必须指出：和平绝不能等待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民动员起来，争取和平，亚洲及太平洋区域的和平即能得到保证。摆在我们面前的庄严任务是：紧密地团结起来反对美国重新武装日本，以保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的安全；反对任何国家干涉他国内政，以保卫国家主权的独立和完整，并保证不同制度的国家的和平共处；坚持主张和平解决现有的冲突，以恢复并发展各国间正常的贸易关系和文化交流。
    鉴于上述情势，我们认为在最近的适当时期召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，对保卫和平利益的问题广泛地交换意见并寻求共同解决的适当措施，是有着迫切重大意义的。
    此项建议于一九五一年间即为亚洲及世界各国为和平事业而努力的人们所提倡，在酝酿过程中得到亚洲及太平洋地区广大爱好和平人民的热烈赞同，并都一致主张立即着手进行。印度和平事业的领导者且曾建议此会议应在北京召开。中国人民热烈欢迎这一保卫和平的会议在北京召开，并认为有义不容辞的责任与各国爱好和平与正义的人士立即共同发起。
    对于这个会议的召开和准备，我们谨提出下列各项建议，请求加以考虑：
    第一、参加会议的各国代表主要属亚洲及太平洋区域，代表的范围力求广泛，不分种族、阶层、宗教信仰、以及不同政治见解，凡赞成和平、反对战争的人士都应受到欢迎（包括科学家、教育家、文学家、学者、教授、艺术工作者、新闻工作者、工会领袖、农民运动领袖、青年、学生、妇女领袖、和平运动工作者以及其他爱好和平的人）。
    第二、亚洲及太平洋区域国家各推定本国对和平事业有贡献、有声望、及真心爱好和平的人士参加联名发起此项会议。中华人民共和国的发起人业经推定宋庆龄、郭沫若、彭真、陈叔通、李四光、马寅初、张奚若、刘宁一、蔡畅、茅盾、廖承志等十一人担任。希望贵国能参加联名发起，并请将联名发起人名单于本年四月初旬电告我们。
    第三、亚洲及太平洋区域各国立即成立本国的筹备委员会，以进行参加会议的准备工作，并广泛宣传亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重大意义，以增加广大人民的了解。中华人民共和国参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会业已组成，由刘宁一、廖承志、刘贯一等负责，请经常与他们取得联系。
    第四、于适当时期在北京召开筹备会议，希望贵国推定代表出席参加。贵国参加筹备会议的代表名单希望于本年四月初旬通知刘宁一。
    我们热烈地等待着你们对我们的发起和建议尽速地表示意见和答复。
