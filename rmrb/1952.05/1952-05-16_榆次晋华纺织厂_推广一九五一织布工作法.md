    Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory
    Promotes the 1951 Weaving Method
    Editor: Since the Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory in Shanxi Province began promoting the 1951 weaving method at the end of last year, it has achieved great results. Currently, all 457 weaving workers in the factory have graduated from the factory's "1951 Weaving Method Training Class." After mastering this method, the workers' work ability has greatly improved. Previously, workers could manage six looms; now, they can manage eight. The rate of second-grade cloth has decreased from 0.54% to 0.36%, the waste silk rate per piece has decreased by 16.7%, and the number of thread breakages has also decreased. The main reason for these achievements is that the leading cadres have strengthened political education for the workers. For example, some workers were not convinced of this advanced work method and attended the training to "see what it was all about." The leading cadres addressed this thinking by conducting individual mobilization and persuasion work, and promptly used methods such as blackboards and cartoons for propaganda and education, correcting the above conservative ideas.

### 榆次晋华纺织厂  推广一九五一织布工作法

    榆次晋华纺织厂
    推广一九五一织布工作法
    编辑同志：山西榆次晋华纺织厂自去年年底推广一九五一织布工作法以来，已有很大成绩。现在，全厂四百五十七个织布工人，已先后在该厂“一九五一织布工作法训练班”毕了业。工人们掌握了这一工作法后，工作能力大大提高。以前能看六台车的工人，现在已经能看八台。次布率由百分之零点五四降低到零点三六，回丝率每匹减少了百分之十六点七，断头次数也减少了。获得这样成绩的主要原因，是领导干部对职工加强了政治教育。如有的工人对这先进工作法不服气，参加学习是为了看“底”。领导干部就针对这种思想，进行个别动员说服工作，并及时通过黑板报、漫画等方式作宣传教育，纠正了以上的保守思想。
