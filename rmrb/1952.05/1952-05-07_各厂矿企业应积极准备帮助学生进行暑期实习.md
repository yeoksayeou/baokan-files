    Factories and Mines Should Actively Prepare to Help Students with Summer Internships

    To the Editor: The summer of 1952 is approaching, and a large number of university students will be going to factories, mines, and transportation enterprises for internships. Internships are one of the best teaching methods to combine theory and practice, and also one of the characteristics of the New Democratic education system that is superior to the capitalist education system. In the past, most of the specialized departments, bureaus, and their affiliated factories and mines attached considerable importance to the internship work of the students. They made full preparations in advance, and the responsible cadres and employees of each unit actively solved the problems that occurred during our internship. This encouraged our enthusiasm for learning. However, generally speaking, students going to factories to study will have some impact on the factory's production work. Some comrades in factories and mines only saw this aspect, and therefore developed a certain degree of indifference to this matter. They used the excuse of busy production tasks to be unenthusiastic about this matter, and even refused. This attitude is undoubtedly wrong. Cultivating industrial technical talents is of decisive significance for the country's industrialization. However, this arduous task cannot be accomplished well if the teaching departments bear it alone. Factory and mining enterprises should actively cooperate with the teaching departments and give strong assistance to the students in their internships.

    To do a good job in the production internship of university students, I think factories and mining enterprises should do the following: (1) Make full ideological preparations in advance and correct their understanding of production internships. From leading comrades to relevant staff, they should clearly recognize the important significance of this for training cadres for national economic construction. (2) Organize an institution to lead production internships in a unified manner, with cadres who have theoretical knowledge and production experience in charge. (3) Prepare early to collect relevant production internship materials, such as machine equipment blueprints, technical cards, original records of various machine operations, and various materials for management internships that can be used for reference. (4) Communist Party and Communist Youth League responsible comrades should seize the opportunity during the students' internships to conduct class education for them. For example, organize labor models to give reports, hold symposiums, etc.
                                                                                                                              Shen Liang'an

    Editor's Note: Reader Shen Liang'an's opinions are important, and relevant departments should find ways to solve these problems as soon as possible.

### 各厂矿企业应积极准备帮助学生进行暑期实习

    各厂矿企业应积极准备帮助学生进行暑期实习
    编辑同志：一九五二年的暑期快到了，一大批高等学校学生将要去厂、矿、交通企业实习。实习是使理论和实践相结合的最好的教学方式之一，也是新民主主义教育制度优越于资本主义教育制度的特点之一。过去，绝大部分的专业部、局及其所属厂矿企业对学生们的实习工作是相当重视的。他们事先进行了充分的准备，各单位的负责干部及职工都积极地为我们解决在实习过程中所发生的问题。这鼓舞了我们学习的热情。但，一般说来，同学们下厂学习，对厂里的生产工作多少是会有一些影响的。有些厂矿企业的同志只看到了这一方面，因此对这件事就产生了某种程度上的冷淡。他们藉口生产任务忙，对这件事不积极，甚至加以拒绝。这种态度无疑是错误的。培养工业技术人材，对国家工业化具有决定性的意义。但这个艰巨的任务若由教学部门单独负担是不会搞好的。厂矿企业部门应主动地配合教学部门，给实习的学生以大力的帮助。
    要做好高等学校学生的生产实习工作，我认为厂矿企业应做好以下几件事：（一）事先有充分思想准备，端正对生产实习的认识。从领导同志到有关工作人员都应明确认识这对培养国家经济建设干部的重要意义。（二）组织统一领导生产实习的机构，由具有理论修养和生产经验的干部负责。（三）及早准备搜集有关生产实习的资料，如可以参考的机器设备蓝图、技术卡片、各种机器操作方面的原始纪录以及管理实习的各种资料。（四）共产党、青年团负责同志，应抓紧在学生实习期间，对他们进行阶级教育。比如组织劳动模范作报告、开座谈会等。

    编者按：读者沈亮庵的意见是重要的，有关部门应及早设法解决这些问题。
