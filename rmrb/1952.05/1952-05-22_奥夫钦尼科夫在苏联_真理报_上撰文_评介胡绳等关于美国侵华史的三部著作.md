Today, "Pravda" published a book review by Ovchinnikov entitled "Several Books Describing American Aggression Against China," introducing the Russian translations of three books by Chinese historians published by the Soviet Foreign Literature Publishing House in 1951. These three books are: Hu Sheng's "Imperialism and Chinese Politics" (Russian translation "The Aggression of Imperialist Countries Against China"), Liu Danian's "A History of American Aggression Against China," and Qin Benli's "A History of American Economic Aggression Against China." The author of the book review writes: China has always occupied a special position in the aggressive plans of the American ruling groups. After participating in the plunder of China in the first five decades of the nineteenth century, the American rulers have never abandoned their plan: to become the exclusive master of that vast and resource-rich country, to turn it into their colony, and to turn it into a base for aggression against other countries.

The "learned" lackeys of Wall Street, who specialize in distorting history, try every possible means to depict American imperialism as a "cultural envoy" and "benefactor" of the peoples of colonies and dependent countries. This is clearly visible in their attempts to cover up American Far East policy, especially its policy toward China.

Exposing the lies of imperialist propaganda and revealing the bandit nature of the past and present American policy toward China is the task undertaken by the authors of these three books, who are progressive Chinese historians.

These three books are of great value. They convincingly prove that the policy of the American ruling groups toward China, no matter what form it takes, has always been a policy of aggression.

These three books provide many new historical facts proving that as early as the mid-nineteenth century, the United States had already begun to prepare a bridgehead for large-scale aggression against China. For this purpose, they attempted to invade Taiwan and Korea. The American expansion in the Pacific was also a preparation for expanding aggression against Asia.

Chinese historians devote many pages to describing American aggression against China during the general crisis of capitalism.

They emphasize that the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution had a tremendous impact, intensifying the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggressors. Hu Sheng pointed out that the liberation of the Russian people instilled in the Chinese people the idea that they must fight for liberation.

Amidst the new upsurge of the Chinese national liberation movement, American aggression intensified. The imperialists of that period adopted more covert forms of armed intervention.

The Wall Street powers placed their greatest hopes on Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people. They deliberately used the hands of domestic reactionaries in China to stifle the Chinese revolution and strengthen their position in that country. The three books reveal that in 1926, that is, even before Chiang Kai-shek launched his counter-revolutionary coup, he had already been bought by American agents.

Chinese historians expose the connection between the American policy of aggression against China and the anti-Soviet conspiracy of American imperialism. This connection is particularly evident in the American ruling groups' instigation of Japanese aggression against China and their alignment of the Japanese warlords against the Soviet Union.

As Wu Xiuquan said in his speech to the United Nations Security Council, after the surrender of Japanese imperialism in 1945, the American government immediately began to pursue a policy of openly interfering in China's internal affairs, deliberately establishing exclusive hegemony there. Turning China into an American colony has become a part of the American monopoly capitalists' aggressive plan to prepare for an anti-Soviet war and dominate the world.

When the authors of these books mention the treaties and secret agreements signed by the Kuomintang clique and its foreign masters, they emphasize that the purpose of these shameful documents was to make China an American colony.

Ovchinnikov writes: In addition to analyzing American economic expansion, military intervention, and political oppression against China, these books also provide a wealth of material on the ideological aggression of American imperialism. In the last century, Americans had already launched extensive missionary activities in China. Qin Benli writes: "This is an attempt to establish tentacles of aggression in every corner of China, using so-called 'culture,' 'God,' and 'charity' to make the Chinese people recognize the enemy as a friend, and willingly be his slaves and accomplices for generations to come."

The purpose of all this was to corrupt the minds of Chinese youth, suppress patriotic sentiments, and instill worship of the "American way of life." In 1908, the United States returned its share of the Boxer Indemnity in a sensational manner for the purpose of "establishing schools in China." They attempted to use Chinese money to train agents for themselves. Many traitors of the Chinese people, docile slaves of American monopoly capitalists, were trained in American educational institutions.

Ovchinnikov concludes: The rich historical facts collected by the authors of these books depict a vivid picture of how the increasingly deep, increasingly broad, and continuously intensifying American aggression against China unfolded.

These works by Chinese historians are a powerful weapon in the current struggle of the Chinese people against American aggression. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th dispatch from TASS)

    奥夫钦尼科夫在苏联“真理报”上撰文
    评介胡绳等关于美国侵华史的三部著作
    今天“真理报”登载奥夫钦尼科夫题为“叙述美国侵略中国的几本书”的一篇书评，介绍一九五一年苏联外国作品出版局印行的中国历史家们所著的三本书的俄文译本。这三本书就是：胡绳的“帝国主义与中国政治”（俄译“帝国主义国家对中国的侵略”）、刘大年的“美国侵华史”、钦本立的“美帝经济侵华史”。书评的作者写道：中国一向在美国统治集团的侵略计划中占着一个特别的地位。美国统治者早在十九世纪的头五十年中参加对中国的掠夺以后，就没有放弃过他们的计划：要成为那个地大物博的国家的独占的主子，要把它变成他们的殖民地，变成他们对其他国家实行侵略的一个基地。
    华尔街“有学问”的奴才们，专门曲解历史，千方百计地拚命把美国帝国主义描绘成殖民地与附属国各族人民的“文化使者”和“恩人”。在他们企图掩饰美国的远东政策、特别是对华政策的时候，这一点是清清楚楚地可以看得出来的。
    揭穿帝国主义宣传的谰言，暴露美国过去与现在对华政策的盗匪性质，是这三本书的作者所负起的任务，他们是进步的中国历史家。
    这三本书具有极大价值。它们令人信服地证明了：美国统治集团的对华政策，不管采取什么形式，始终是侵略的政策。
    这三本书提供许多新的史实，证明早在十九世纪中叶，美国已经开始准备桥头堡，以便大规模侵略中国。他们为了这个目的，企图侵占台湾和朝鲜。美国在太平洋的扩张，也就是对亚洲作扩大侵略的准备。
    中国历史家们以许多篇幅叙述在资本主义总危机时期中美国对中国的侵略。
    他们强调指出：伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利发生了一种极大的影响，使中国人民为反对帝国主义侵略者而进行的斗争激烈起来。胡绳指出俄国人民的解放向中国人民灌输了一种必须为解放而斗争的思想。
    在中国民族解放运动的新高潮中间，美国的侵略行动加剧起来。那个时期的帝国主义者采用了比较隐蔽的武装干涉形式。
    华尔街权贵把他们的最大希望寄托在中国人民公敌蒋介石身上。他们蓄意用中国国内反动派的手来窒息中国的革命，来加强他们在那个国家中的地位。这三本书揭露了：一九二六年，就是说蒋介石甚至在他发动反革命政变以前，就已经被美国特务收买了。
    中国历史家们揭露了美国侵华政策与美帝反苏阴谋之间的联系。在美国统治集团怂恿日本侵略中国，并且使日本军阀反苏方面，这种联系特别显而易见。
    正如伍修权在联合国安全理事会的发言中所说，一九四五年日本帝国主义投降以后，美国政府立刻开始推行一种公开干涉中国内政的政策，蓄意在那儿确立独占的霸权。变中国为美国殖民地，这已成为美国垄断资本家准备反苏战争并独霸世界的侵略计划中的一个部分了。
    这几本书的作者述及国民党集团和它的外国主子所签订的条约和秘密协定时，着重指出这些可耻的文件的目的就是要使中国成为美国殖民地。
    奥夫钦尼科夫写道：这几本书就美国对华经济扩张、军事干涉和政治压迫作了分析以外，并且提供了关于美帝国主义思想侵略的许多材料。在上一世纪，美国人就已经在中国展开广泛的传教活动。钦本立写道：“这就是企图在中国的每个角落，建立起侵略的触角，以所谓‘文化’、‘上帝’、‘慈善’使中国人民认敌为友，而子子孙孙心甘情愿做他的奴隶和帮凶。”
    这一切的目的是要腐化中国青年的心灵、压抑爱国主义的情绪、灌输对“美国生活方式”的崇拜。一九○八年美国以煽惑性的态度退还它那一部分庚子赔款，用来“在华兴学”。他们企图利用中国的钱为他们自己训练特务分子。不少中国人民的叛徒、美国垄断资本家的驯良奴才，是在美国教育机关中训练出来的。
    奥夫钦尼科夫在结语中写道：这几本书的作者所搜集的丰富史实，描绘出关于日益深入、日益扩大、而且继续不断地激化的美国对中国的侵略是怎样展开的一幅生动的画面。
    中国历史家们的这些著作，是目前中国人民为反对美国侵略而斗争的一个有力的武器。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十六日电）
