Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 6th: Bainqen Erdini sent a message of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government on April 30th, after returning to Lhasa on April 28th. The telegram reads as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

Under your wise leadership, with the strong assistance of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and the Northwest Military Region, and with the active help of Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, the Dalai Lama, and governments at all levels in Tibet, we arrived in Lhasa smoothly on April 28th and received a warm welcome from Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, the Tibet Military Region, the Tibetan local government, and the broad masses of monks and laypeople. That afternoon, I met with the Dalai Lama at the Potala Palace and had friendly talks on the great achievements of the motherland and issues such as our future unity and the implementation of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. This strengthened my conviction that, under your correct leadership and with the active assistance of Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and the Tibet Military Region, I will unite closely with the Dalai Lama to thoroughly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet and build Tibet into a free and happy new Tibet. This is specially reported to you. I wish you good health!

Bainqen Erdini
