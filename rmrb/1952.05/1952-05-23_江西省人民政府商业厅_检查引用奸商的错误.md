    Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce
    Examines Error of Using Unscrupulous Merchants
    Editor: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on March 10th exposing the fact that some state-owned enterprises in Jiangxi Province were using unscrupulous merchants and making sharp criticisms. We fully accept this criticism. In the three years since Jiangxi's liberation, we have turned a blind eye to the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements, have had a vague understanding of the nature of the state-owned economy, have not clearly drawn a line with the bourgeoisie ideologically, and have long neglected political and ideological leadership, holding purely technical viewpoints. This is a serious deviation of not paying attention to politics. We did not have sufficient understanding of the policy of包下来“bao xialai” which means to take over all the old personnel, at the beginning of the liberation. We only used the old personnel, lacking education and transformation, and did not pay attention to purifying the internal structure while spreading out. Therefore, we opened the door to illegal bourgeois elements, causing great losses to state property. We also turned a blind eye to the chaotic phenomenon of the abuse of personnel in various trade enterprise departments. In the preliminary inspection of state-owned trade departments at the provincial level in our province during this "Three-Anti" movement, it was discovered that illegal bourgeois elements who had infiltrated accounted for 24 percent of the total number of people.
    Currently, the "Three-Anti" movement in Jiangxi Province is entering the stage of recovering stolen goods, determining cases, and dealing with corrupt elements. Next, we must thoroughly examine the thinking of leaders at all levels, first clearing up the thinking of key leading cadres. Through this "Three-Anti" movement, we must strengthen ideological leadership over trade departments, earnestly rectify organizational structures, boldly cultivate and absorb activists in the "Three-Anti" movement, establish strict personnel systems, purify our ranks, and thoroughly correct the mistakes made in past work.

### 江西省人民政府商业厅  检查引用奸商的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    江西省人民政府商业厅
    检查引用奸商的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报三月十日发表读者来信，揭发江西省某些国营企业引用奸商的事实，并提出尖锐的批评，我们完全接受这个批评。江西解放三年来，我们对于不法资产阶级分子的进攻熟视无睹，对国营经济的性质认识模糊，与资产阶级在思想上没有明确地划清界限，长期忽视政治和思想领导，有单纯技术观点，这是严重的不问政治的偏向。我们对于解放初期把全部旧人员包下来的政策认识不够，对旧人员只有使用，缺乏教育改造，没有在铺开摊子的同时，注意纯洁内部。因此，给不法资产阶级分子开了大门，使国家财产遭受了很大损失。我们对于各贸易企业部门滥用人员的混乱现象，也是熟视无睹。在这次“三反”运动中，我省省级各国营贸易部门经初步检查，发现混进来的不法资产阶级分子，即占总人数百分之二十四。
    现在“三反”运动在江西省正进入追赃定案处理贪污分子的阶段，接着要彻底检查各级领导思想，首先清算主要领导干部的思想。经过这次“三反”运动，一定要加强对贸易部门的思想领导，切实整顿组织机构，大胆培养和吸收“三反”运动中的积极分子，建立严密的人事制度，纯洁我们的队伍，并彻底纠正过去工作中所犯的错误。
