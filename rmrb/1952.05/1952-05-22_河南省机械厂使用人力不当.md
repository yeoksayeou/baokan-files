    Improper Use of Manpower in Henan Mechanical Factory
    To the Editor: We were originally students of Zhengzhou Senior Industrial School. After graduating last May, we were assigned to work at the Henan Mechanical Factory. The leaders do not know the situation below and do not consider what we studied. Wherever there is a need for people, they assign us there. Some of us are doing work that is not related to what we studied, which violates the original intention of the people in cultivating us. Some elementary normal school students are doing technical work, which is obviously inappropriate.
    Our practice period, according to the personnel section chief, is two months, and according to Deputy Manager Yang Zhichao, it is half a year. But we have been in the factory for nine months and are still trainees. The leaders never go down to understand the work situation of the students. There are too many staff members in our factory, and the ratio of workers to staff is almost two to one. As far as we know, one student in the planning section only needs one hour to complete the work for the whole day; another student who does summary work in this section only has a few days of work a month. But the head of the planning section said: "We are still short of five people!" We hope that the relevant industrial departments will pay attention to this issue and make reasonable and appropriate adjustments to the staff in order to unleash the potential capacity in production.

    河南省机械厂使用人力不当
    编辑同志：我们原是郑州高级工业学校的学生，去年五月毕业后，被分配到河南省机械厂工作。领导方面不知道下面的情况，也不顾及我们学的是什么，那里要人就把我们分配到那里。我们之中，有些人做的工作是用非所学，这就违背了人民培养我们的原意。有的初级师范学生却在搞技术工作这显然是不合适的。
    我们的练习期限，人事科长说是两个月，副经理杨志超说是半年。而我们已来厂九个月了，还是练习生。领导方面始终不下去了解同学的工作情况。我厂职员太多了，工人和职员的比例几乎是二比一。据我们所知，计划科的一个同学，只要用一个钟点就能做完全天的工作；在这个科作汇总工作的另一个同学，一个月只有几天的工作。但计划科长说：“还差五个人哩！”我们希望有关工业部门重视这一问题，对工作人员作合理适当的调配，以发挥生产中的潜在能力。  郭德馨　吴永升等三十五人
