The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

Organize Wheat Bumper Harvest Appraisal Work Teams to Work in Major Wheat Producing Areas Across the Country

    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has organized work teams for the wheat bumper harvest appraisal campaign to go to major wheat producing areas across the country.

    As the wheat harvest is approaching, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, in order to implement the instructions issued in early May on carrying out the wheat bumper harvest appraisal campaign, summarizing bumper harvest experiences, and making various preparations for next year's wheat bumper harvest, recently organized 46 cadres from units such as the North China Administrative Council's Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute. On May 12th and 13th, they departed for major wheat producing areas such as Henan, Pingyuan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, and Hebei to specifically assist local agricultural leading organs in promoting wheat bumper harvest work. Their main tasks are: to vigorously promote the development of wheat bumper harvest appraisal and seed selection campaigns in various regions in conjunction with the implementation of bumper harvest reward policies, to investigate typical bumper harvest materials and summarize their bumper harvest experiences, and also to understand some of the problems existing in wheat bumper harvests, in order to prepare favorable conditions for launching the next season's wheat bumper harvest competition campaign.

The East China Department of Agriculture and Forestry Instructs All Regions

    To Make the Work of Selecting and Exchanging Improved Wheat Varieties the Central Task During the Summer Harvest Period

    The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the East China Military and Political Committee issued "Instructions on Launching a Mass Seed Selection and Exchange Campaign," requiring governments at all levels to regard seed selection and exchange as one of the central tasks during this year's summer harvest period. The instructions pointed out: Governments at all levels should mobilize local cadres and labor models to take the lead in seed selection, and organize mass seed selection committees, based on mutual aid teams, to carry out a universal seed evaluation campaign. Mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and state-owned farms participating in the patriotic production increase competition campaign should set an example for the masses in seed selection. Regions that have undergone seed selection last year should conduct re-selection this year; regions that have previously promoted improved varieties should hold wheat harvest appraisals and launch mass appraisal campaigns from the bottom up, comparing cultivation and comparing harvests. The best wheat varieties should be selected in each village, and then further selected by the county. In order to ensure the completion of this task, the instructions require all regions to train a group of cadres and peasant activists in advance, teaching them seed selection techniques, to serve as the backbone for promoting the appraisal campaign.

    The instructions also pointed out that after seed selection, all regions should mobilize farmers to exchange ordinary wheat for improved wheat varieties in order to popularize good varieties.

    The Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry held a work meeting on seed selection and exchange in early May, at which it determined the specific plans and requirements for the province's seed selection and exchange of improved wheat varieties.

Wheat Bumper Harvest Model Shi Anfu

    Talks About the Experience of Irrigating Wheat Fields and Harvesting Wheat

    National wheat bumper harvest model Shi Anfu recently talked to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about important matters that should be paid attention to before and during the wheat harvest.

    Shi Anfu said: Wheat needs a lot of water for heading and grain filling, so it should be irrigated. However, irrigation must be based on the condition of the wheat heading and grain filling. Watering can be done before and after heading and before and at the beginning of grain filling, which has a great effect on the development and filling of wheat grains; however, watering should not be done when the wheat is heading (about four or five days), or when the slurry has become thick (four or five days before the wheat harvest to the time of the wheat harvest). The reason is: at this time, the nutrients in the wheat stalk are working hard to move upward, fully supplying the needs of heading and grain filling. If watering is done, the nutrients in the stalk will be pulled down, making the wheat flowers not open fully, unable to fertilize well and fill the wheat slurry fully. Therefore, if too much watering is done untimely, it will reduce wheat production. Regarding the matters that should be paid attention to when harvesting wheat, Shi Anfu said: Harvesting wheat after it is fully ripe can increase production. How can you know when the wheat is fully ripe? Check whether the uppermost node on the wheat stalk is completely yellowed. If this node is not completely yellowed, it means that the wheat slurry has not been fully filled. Harvesting wheat with wheat slurry that has not been fully filled will reduce production by at least ten catties per mu. When the uppermost node of the wheat stalk is completely yellowed, the wheat is fully ripe and should be harvested. If it is not harvested, wheat grains are prone to falling off, and there is also a risk of reduced production in the event of wind or other accidents. (Xinhua News Agency)

    作好各种准备工作，争取今年小麦丰收
    中央人民政府农业部
    组织小麦丰产评比工作队到全国小麦主要产区工作
    中央人民政府农业部组织小麦丰产评比运动工作队分赴全国小麦主要产区工作。
    小麦即将收获，中央人民政府农业部为贯彻五月初发布的关于开展小麦丰产评比运动，总结丰产经验，为明年小麦丰产作好各种准备的指示，最近特组织华北行政委员会农林水利局、华北农业科学研究所等单位干部四十六人，在五月十二、十三两日分赴河南、平原、陕西、山东、山西、河北等主要小麦产地，具体协助各地农业领导机关推动小麦丰产工作。他们的主要任务是：结合贯彻丰产奖励政策，大力推动各地开展小麦丰产评比和选种运动，调查丰产典型材料并总结其丰产经验，同时还了解小麦丰产中存在的一些问题，为发动下季小麦丰产竞赛运动准备有利条件。  （新华社）
    华东农林部指示各地
    要把选换优良麦种的工作作为夏收期间的中心任务
    华东军政委员会农林部发出“关于发动群众选、换麦种运动的指示”，要求各级人民政府把选、换麦种，当作今年夏收期间的中心工作之一。指示指出：各级人民政府应发动地方干部和劳动模范带头选种，并组织群众性的选种委员会，以互助组为基础，开展普遍的评选麦种运动。参加爱国增产竞赛运动的互助组、农业生产合作社和国营农场，要向群众做出选种的榜样。去年经过选种的地区，今年要进行复选；已往推广过良种的地区，要举行收麦评比，开展由下而上的比栽培、比收成的群众性评比运动。各村评选出最好的麦种，然后再由县加以评选。为了保证这一任务的完成，指示要求各地事先训练一批干部和农民积极分子，教会他们选种的技术，作为推动评选运动的骨干。
    指示还指出，各地选种后，应发动农民用一般的麦子交换优良的麦种，以求良种普及。
    山东省人民政府农林厅已在五月初召开了一次选、换麦种的工作会议，会上确定了全省选、换优良麦种的具体计划和要求。  （新华社）
    小麦丰产模范史安福
    谈麦田浇水和收麦的经验
    全国小麦丰产模范史安福在最近向新华社记者谈了有关麦收前和麦收时应注意的重要事项。
    史安福说：小麦扬花结实需要水多，应该浇水。但浇水时必须依据麦子扬花和灌浆的情形，在扬花前后和灌浆前与初灌浆时，都可以浇水，这对麦粒发育充实有很大的作用；但正当麦子扬花的时候（约四、五天），或浆已变浓了的时候（麦收前四、五天到麦收时），都不应该浇水。原因是：这时麦秆内的养料正在使劲上行，全力供给扬花灌浆的需要，如果浇了水，就会把秆内的养料扯下来，使麦花开得不圆满，不能很好受精和饱满地灌麦浆。因此，如果不择时宜地多浇水，就会使麦子减产。关于小麦收割时应注意的事项，史安福说：小麦在熟透后割能增加产量。怎样才能知道麦子熟透呢？要查看一下麦秆上最上面的一个节子是否黄透了。如果这个节子还没有黄透，就说明麦浆还没有灌饱。把麦浆还没有灌饱的麦子收割下来，每亩至少要减产十斤。麦秆最上面的一个节子黄透了，麦子就熟透了，就应收割。如果还不收，割麦粒容易脱落，如遇刮风或其他意外，也有减产的危险。
