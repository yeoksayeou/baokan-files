Xinhua News Agency, 14th: People from all walks of life in West Germany are extensively launching a great struggle against the militarist "General Treaty", against rearmament, and demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany based on Soviet proposals.

Workers and trade union committees in many parts of West Germany have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Germany, passing resolutions one after another, advocating large-scale strikes and demonstrations to prevent the signing of the "General Treaty". At the Stuttgart District Committee of the Metalworkers' Union, representatives of 60,000 metalworkers demanded that a strike be used to prevent the signing of the "General Treaty". Representatives elected from among 57,000 metallurgical workers held a meeting in Nuremberg, demanding that the Central Council of the West German Trade Union Federation implement the Bavarian Trade Union's decision against conscription and against West Germany's joining the Atlantic Pact. Youth union workers from fifty large enterprises in Duisburg held a meeting and issued a declaration to all metallurgical workers in West Germany, calling on them to hold mass strikes and demonstrations to protest the conclusion of the "General Treaty". A trade union meeting of representatives of 13,000 construction workers in Lower Saxony also passed a resolution demanding all-German elections and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. A conference of young miners and production committee members from various mines in Mülheim, Ruhr area, passed a resolution calling on miners to hold large-scale strikes and demonstrations to prevent the signing of the "General Treaty".

West German farmers are heroically fighting against the occupation of their land by the US and British occupation forces, the trampling of their crops, and the transformation of fertile farmland into training grounds and military bases. Farmers in Söllingen, Hanbach, Senbach, and Agusto are defending their land, and the farmers in Senbach have driven the land requisition committee off their land.

West German youth originally planned to hold a mass rally in Essen on May 11 to oppose the conclusion of the "General Treaty", strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and achieve the early unification of Germany. Many different youth groups in West Germany have decided to participate in this mass rally. In a state of panic, the West German puppet government illegally prohibited the holding of this mass rally. However, despite this, more than 20,000 young men and women from all over West Germany went to Essen to demonstrate, expressing their unyielding will to fight for maintaining peace and unifying the motherland. More than 10,000 young men and women bravely marched, defying the threats of the West German authorities, and shouted: "We don't want the 'General Treaty'!" "We are against conscription for the establishment of mercenary armies!" "We demand the conclusion of a peace treaty!" The local police even opened fire and wounded the demonstrating youth. This bloody atrocity aroused even greater anger among the youth of West Germany and the people of Essen, who subsequently held a large-scale protest demonstration on the 12th.

Bourgeois figures and patriotic social figures in West Germany have also begun to protest more and more strongly against Adenauer's policies. Geiler, the former Minister of Agriculture of Lower Saxony, who was squeezed out of the Christian Democratic Party by the Adenauer group in 1950, recently founded a German Socialist Party in Lower Saxony, condemning Adenauer's conspiracy to conclude the "General Treaty" and demanding that a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France be held to restore the unity of Germany. At a rally held in Heidelberg, Pastor Oberhof spoke, calling on everyone to actively oppose the conclusion of the "General Treaty" that Adenauer is preparing. A resolution was also passed at the meeting, demanding that the Bonn Parliament prevent the signing of this shameful treaty.

    反对阿登纳与美英法缔结重新武装的条约
    西德人民将展开示威和罢工斗争
    【新华社十四日讯】西德各阶层人民正广泛地展开反对军国主义的“一般性条约”、反对重新武装、要求根据苏联建议缔结对德和约的伟大斗争。
    西德许多地方的工人和工会委员会热烈响应德国统一社会党和德国共产党的号召，纷纷通过决议，主张举行大罢工和示威，来阻止签订“一般性条约”。在五金工会斯图加特区委员会上，代表六万五金工人的代表们要求以罢工来防止签订“一般性条约”。从五万七千名冶金工人中选出的代表在纽伦堡举行会议，要求西德工会联合会中央理事会实行巴伐利亚工会反对征兵、反对西德加入大西洋集团的决定。杜伊斯堡五十家大企业的青年工会工作者举行会议，向西德全体冶金工人发出宣言，号召他们举行群众性罢工和示威来抗议缔结“一般性条约”。下萨克森州一万三千名建筑工人的代表所举行的工会会议，也通过决议，要求举行全德选举和缔结对德和约。在鲁尔区米尔海姆举行的青年矿工及各矿生产委员会议通过决定，号召矿工们举行大罢工和示威，以阻止“一般性条约”的签订。
    西德农民正在英勇地为反对美英占领军霸占他们的土地，蹂躏他们的禾苗，把肥沃的耕地变为练兵场和军事基地而斗争。塞林根、韩巴斯、森巴赫和阿古斯托等地农民正在保卫着他们的土地，森巴赫的农民并已把土地征用委员会从他们的土地上赶走了。
    西德青年原订于五月十一日在埃森举行群众大会，反对缔结“一般性条约”，争取缔结对德和约和及早统一德国。西德许多不同的青年团体都已决定参加这个群众大会。西德傀儡政府在惊慌万状之下竟非法禁止举行这个群众大会。但是，尽管如此仍有两万多青年男女从西德各地到埃森去示威，表示他们为维持和平与统一祖国而斗争的不屈意志。一万多男女青年不顾西德当局的恫吓英勇地行进并高喊：“我们不要‘一般性条约’！”“我们反对为成立雇佣军而实行征兵！”“我们要求缔结和约！”当地警察竟开枪杀伤了示威青年。这种血腥暴行激起西德青年和埃森人民更大的愤怒，埃森人民接着在十二日又举行了大规模的抗议示威游行。
    西德资产阶级人士及爱国社会人士也开始越来越强烈地抗议阿登纳的政策。一九五○年被阿登纳集团排挤出基督教民主党的前下萨克森州农业部长盖雷克，最近在下萨克森州成立了一个德国社会党，谴责阿登纳企图缔结“一般性条约”的阴谋，要求召开苏、美、英、法四国会议来恢复德国的统一。在海德尔堡举行的一次集会上，奥柏霍甫牧师发言号召大家积极进行反对缔结阿登纳正在准备的“一般性条约”。会上并通过决议，要求波恩议会阻止签订这个可耻的条约。
