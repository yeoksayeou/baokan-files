    Circular from the Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications
    "Mount Everest" should be renamed "Mount Qomolangma" and "Trans-Himalayas" should be renamed "Gangdise Mountains"
    The Ministry of Interior of the Central People's Government and the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government issued a circular on May 8th. The circular stated that "Mount Everest" should be renamed "Mount Qomolangma" and "Trans-Himalayas" should be renamed "Gangdise Mountains". The full text of the circular is as follows: The highest peak of the Himalayas in Tibet, China, was originally named "Mount Qomolangma". As early as 1717 (the 56th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty), Shengzhu, a clerk of the Court of Colonial Affairs of the Qing Dynasty, along with Lamas, used this name based on the local Tibetan custom when drawing a map of Tibet. "Qomolangma" means "Mother of the Universe" in Tibetan. However, since the Indian Survey Bureau measured the height of this peak in 1852, Westerners have used the name of the Director of the Indian Survey Bureau, Everest (British), as the name of this peak since 1858. People who compile gazetteers and maps in our country have also blindly adopted this name. It is a great mistake to use the name of an imperialist colonial official to call our country's highest peak.
    At the same time, in most gazetteers and maps, the "Gangdise Mountains" within Tibet have always been referred to by the extremely erroneous name "Trans-Himalayas". The Gangdise Mountains traverse the central part of Tibet, located north of the Himalayas. The British imperialists, from the perspective of their invaders, presumptuously called this mountain the "Trans-Himalayas", which is also a very absurd name.
    From now on, whether in textbooks, maps, or other works, whenever Mount Qomolangma or the Gangdise Mountains are mentioned, they must no longer be mistakenly referred to as "Mount Everest" or "Trans-Himalayas".

    中央人民政府内务部、出版总署通报
    “额菲尔士峰”应正名为“珠穆朗玛峰”“外喜马拉雅山”应正名为“冈底斯山”
    中央人民政府内务部、中央人民政府出版总署于五月八日发出通报。通报说明：“额菲尔士峰”应正名为“珠穆朗玛峰”、“外喜马拉雅山”应正名为“冈底斯山”。通报全文如下：我国西藏喜马拉雅山的最高峰，原名“珠穆朗玛峰”。远在公元一七一七年（即清康熙五十六年），清朝理藩院主事胜住会同喇嘛绘制西藏地图时，即根据当地藏族的习惯称呼开始用这个名称。“珠穆朗玛”是藏语“圣母之水”的意思。但自一八五二年印度测量局测得此峰高度以后，西人便从一八五八年起，将印度测量局局长额菲尔士（英国人）的名字作为此峰的名字。我国编撰地志舆图的人也盲目地采用了这个名称。用帝国主义殖民官吏的名字来称呼我国的最高山峰，实在是很大的一个错误。
    同时，多数地志舆图中，对于西藏境内的“冈底斯山”，一直沿用着“外喜马拉雅山”这一极端错误的名称。冈底斯山横亘西藏中部，位在喜马拉雅山以北，英帝国主义者竟以其侵略者的观点，妄称此山为“外喜马拉雅山”，这种称呼也是非常荒谬的。
    此后无论教科书、舆图或其他著作，凡用到珠穆朗玛峰或者冈底斯山时，都不得再误称为“额菲尔士峰”或者“外喜马拉雅山”。
