Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th - The London "Daily Worker" published on the 19th that the Vice Chairman of the British Communist Party, Dutt, issued a warning regarding the measures taken by the British government in Hong Kong to persecute Chinese residents. He said: if the British government continues to take these measures, such provocative police actions may make Hong Kong one of the dangerous locations for expanding the war in the Far East.

Dutt stated in a speech at the meeting of representatives of the Mansfield "Labor Monthly" that a serious situation has occurred in Hong Kong at a time when the threat of expanding the war in the Far East is increasingly acute. The repressive measures taken by the British authorities in Hong Kong against Chinese residents had reached such a point in March that the police shot and wounded and killed many Chinese residents. Now the Chinese people's newspaper "Ta Kung Pao" has been ordered to suspend publication for six months, and the editors of two other Chinese newspapers have also been arrested, simply because these newspapers reprinted Beijing newspapers' protests against this incident. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a protest with the British authorities regarding the persecution of Chinese residents in Hong Kong. The British authorities are trying every means to conceal the seriousness of the situation from the British public. Dutt said: "Hong Kong is part of China, and Britain's current occupation of Hong Kong is based solely on the rights obtained after the infamous Opium War. Britain's actions in Hong Kong are decisive for the future of Sino-British relations. We should demand an immediate end to the repressive measures, the release of political prisoners, and the cancellation of the order to suspend the publication of Chinese people's newspapers. If these steps are not taken, then, judging from the military plans of Western countries to expand the war in the Far East, these provocative police actions will make Hong Kong one of the dangerous locations."

    英共副主席杜德发表演说
    警告英国政府应立即停止在香港的暴行
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】伦敦“工人日报”十九日载称，英国共产党副主席杜德就香港英国政府迫害中国居民的措施发出警告说：如果英国政府继续采取这些措施，这种挑衅性的警察行动可能使香港成为在远东扩大战争的危险地点之一。
    杜德在曼斯菲尔德“劳工月刊”代表的会议上发表演说称：正当在远东扩大战争的威胁日益尖锐化的时候，香港发生了严重的情势。香港英国当局对中国居民采取的镇压措施在三月间已经达到这样地步：警察曾开枪打伤打死中国居民多人。现在中国人民的报纸“大公报”又已被勒令停刊六个月，另外两家中国报纸的编辑也遭到逮捕，理由只是因为这些报纸转载了北京报纸对于这一事件的抗议。中国外交部已就迫害香港中国居民事件向英国当局提出了抗议。英国当局却千方百计想在英国民众面前，掩饰情势的严重性。杜德说：“香港是中国的一部分，英国现在占据香港，只是根据不名誉的鸦片战争以后得到的权利。英国在香港的行动，对于中英两国邦交前途是有决定性作用的。我们应该要求立即停止镇压措施，释放政治犯，并取消勒令中国人民报纸停刊的命令。如果不采取这些步骤，那末从西方国家在远东扩大战争的军事计划看起来，这些挑衅的警察行动就会使香港成为危险地点之一。”
