Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 15th: While the U.S. representatives are putting forward unreasonable proposals at the armistice negotiation table, the U.S. aggressors are unscrupulously carrying out shameless threats and intimidations, and constantly taking unreasonable provocative actions, attempting to use this to implement their scheme of sabotaging the armistice negotiations.

    Ridgway, in his shameless statement issued on the 7th, said with extreme arrogance: "Regardless of the enemy's views on individual issues, the United Nations Command's proposed solutions require the Communist side to accept them in their entirety." Ridgway's implication is that if our side is unwilling to "accept them in their entirety," then they will not hesitate to indefinitely delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations. The U.S. aggressors' sinister plot to delay and sabotage the negotiations with this absurd proposal has been brazenly revealed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Foster in Washington. On the same day that Ridgway issued his statement, Foster publicly declared at a press conference: "If the United Nations' suggestions are rejected, the U.S. attitude will adapt accordingly." Foster admitted the U.S. side's shameless attempt to delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations and continue the war, saying: "The United Nations Command is willing to continue discussing the proposed armistice methods with the Communists within a 'reasonable period'." He explained: "It is hard to say whether a 'reasonable period' refers to two weeks, two months, or a year." Foster also openly threatened, overestimating himself, with clamors such as "blockading China" and "attacking the Chinese mainland." An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 8th also revealed that Washington's "officials and diplomats" are "considering" the measures to be taken after the U.S. proposal is rejected. They believe that the "most likely to be implemented" measures include "further prolonging the stalemate on the current front, blockading Communist China's ports, and attacking the Chinese coast." While carrying out this shameless intimidation, the U.S. aggressors have created a series of new provocative incidents. On the 12th of this month, U.S. military aircraft seriously violated the agreement and barbarously strafed the supply vehicles of our delegation, causing the serious bloodshed incident of Li Dong-soo, a staff member of our delegation, being shot and killed. At the same time, U.S. military aircraft once again violated the agreement, intruding into the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone on the 14th, dropping a large number of flares and conducting strafing. From this, people can clearly see that the U.S. side's true intention in putting forward this so-called "comprehensive solution," which is absolutely unacceptable to our side, is obviously to delay or even sabotage the armistice negotiations in order to achieve its ulterior and despicable purposes.

    This ulterior and despicable purpose of the U.S. aggressors has been revealed by the newspapers of the U.S. big bourgeoisie. As early as March, the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" said: "If the United States is forced to achieve peace in Korea, it may overturn the current plan to complete the new North Atlantic Organization and the European Defense Command." The U.S. Catholic weekly "America" said even more bluntly: "Korea is the stimulus to accelerate our own armaments and make the North Atlantic Treaty Organization more energetic." In April, when U.S. imperialism released an optimistic atmosphere for the armistice negotiations in order to deceive the people of the world who yearn for peace and demand an immediate end to the Korean War, the New York stock market immediately experienced violent fluctuations. According to a broadcast by Australian Radio on April 16: "Rumors that a truce would be achieved in Korea soon and optimistic reports about the situation in Europe triggered a wave of selling on the New York stock market. The value of various stocks fell by nearly ten billion dollars in one day." The "Wall Street Journal's" Washington dispatch on April 11 also said: "A peace panic has begun to appear in the government. They are worried about the psychological impact [of a Korean armistice]. They estimate that if the armistice gives the Soviet Union's powerful peace offensive a reputation, then Europeans who have already expressed hesitation about expanding their armies will be even more unwilling to do so." This prospect of a Korean armistice has greatly disturbed the U.S. monopoly capitalists who are making a fortune from the war. A business reporter for the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" reported on April 17: "The news about the Korean armistice talks has undoubtedly had an unstable impact on many sectors of industry and commerce... It is not difficult to imagine what will happen if the defense plan is greatly extended. Last year, government procurement drove up prices and wholesale prices. When this support (government procurement) is lost and the market relies solely on civilian needs, prices will fall, and the decline in the prices of many commodities has not stopped until now. Therefore, it is easy for us to understand why people are uneasy about the impact that a reduction in defense spending will have on our economy. This uneasiness is already reflected in the cautious attitude taken when trading futures."

    The matter is now very clear. The reason why the U.S. side deliberately delays or even sabotages the armistice negotiations is to maintain or even expand the international tension, so as to intensify the frantic arms race and enable the bosses of Wall Street to obtain more profits. We want to solemnly warn the U.S. side that the various conspiracies you are carrying out for this despicable and shameless purpose are doomed to bankruptcy. We advise you to put away your unreasonable so-called "comprehensive solution" plan as soon as possible, otherwise you will definitely taste the bitter fruit of your own delay and sabotage of the armistice negotiations.

### 美方一面提出蛮横无理要求一面进行挑衅和恫吓  妄图拖延和破坏停战谈判扩大紧张局势

    美方一面提出蛮横无理要求一面进行挑衅和恫吓
    妄图拖延和破坏停战谈判扩大紧张局势
    【新华社开城十五日电】正当美方代表在停战谈判的会议桌上提出蛮横无理的方案的时候，美国侵略者竟肆无忌惮地进行无耻的威胁和恫吓，并不断采取无理的挑衅行动，企图借此实施其破坏停战谈判的诡计。
    李奇微在他七日发表的无耻声明中狂妄已极地说：“不管敌方对个别问题持什么意见，联合国军提出的办法需要共方全盘接受。”李奇微言下之意，如果我方不愿“全盘接受”，那就不惜无限期地拖延以至破坏停战谈判。美国侵略者妄图凭借这个荒谬方案来拖延和破坏谈判的罪恶阴谋，已由美国国防部副部长浮斯特在华盛顿明目张胆地说出来了。浮斯特在李奇微发表声明的同一天，在记者招待会上公然宣称：“如果联合国建议遭到拒绝时，美国的态度将随机应变。”浮斯特供认了美方决心拖延以至破坏停战谈判、继续进行战争的无耻企图说：“联合国军愿意在‘合理的期间以内’与共产党继续讨论所建议的停战办法。”他解释说：“合理的期间究竟是指两星期、两个月或者一年，谁也难说。”浮斯特并公然不自量力地以“封锁中国”、“进攻中国大陆”等叫嚣相恫吓。而美联社华盛顿八日电也透露说：华盛顿的“军官和外交官”正在“斟酌”美方建议遭到拒绝以后所将采取的办法。他们认为“最可能实行的”办法有“在目前的战线上进一步拖延僵持，封锁共产党中国港口，袭击中国海岸”。和进行这种无耻恫吓的同时，美国侵略者已制造了一连串的新的挑衅事件。本月十二日，美方军用飞机严重违反协议，横暴地扫射我方代表团的供应车辆，造成了我方代表团工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲的严重流血事件。同时，美方军用飞机再次破坏协议，于十四日侵入开城中立区上空，投掷大批照明弹并进行扫射。人们从这里可以清楚地看到，美方提出这个为我方所绝对不能接受的所谓“全盘解决办法”，其真正意图显然是在拖延以至破坏停战谈判，以实现其不可告人的卑鄙目的。
    美国侵略者这种不可告人的卑鄙目的已由美国大资产阶级的报刊透露了出来。早在三月间，美国的“基督教科学箴言报”就说：“假若美国要勉强在朝鲜实现和平，就可能推翻完成新的北大西洋组织和欧洲防御司令部机构的目前计划。”美国天主教的周刊“美国”更露骨地说：“朝鲜就是加速我们自己军备和促使北大西洋公约组织有更多生气的刺激物。”在四月间，当美帝国主义为了欺骗全世界渴望和平、要求立即结束朝鲜战争的人民而对停战谈判放出乐观的空气时，纽约的股票市场立即起了剧烈的波动。据澳大利亚电台四月十六日广播：“朝鲜将早日获致休战的谣传以及关于欧洲局面的乐观的报道，掀起纽约股票的卖风。一日之间各种股票价值跌落了几近十亿美元。”“华尔街日报”四月十一日的华盛顿通讯也说：“和平恐慌开始在政府中出现了。他们为（朝鲜休战）心理上的影响而担忧。他们估计，如果休战使苏联的强力的和平攻势获得了声誉，那末，对于扩军已表示踌躇态度的欧洲人甚至将更加来得不愿意。”朝鲜停战的这种远景，已使大发其战争财的美国垄断资本家大为不安。“纽约世界电讯太阳报”的商业记者在四月十七日报道说：“关于朝鲜休战谈判的消息对于许多部门的工商业毫无疑问已经发生了不稳定的影响。……如果国防计划大大延长，将会出现什么情况，是不难想像得到的。去年政府的采购曾使物价及批发价格高涨。当失去这个支持（政府的采购）而市场仅依赖民用需要的时候，物价即行下跌，许多商品价格的下跌到现在尚未停止。因此，我们很容易了解，为什么人们对国防费用的减少对于我们经济将发生的影响感到不安。这种不安情绪已经在进行期货交易时所采取的谨慎小心的态度上反映出来。”
    事情现在已经很清楚，美方之所以蓄意拖延以至破坏停战谈判，是为了保持以至扩大国际间的紧张局势，以便加紧进行疯狂的军备竞赛，使华尔街的老板们能获得更多的利润。我们要正告美方，你们为了这个卑鄙无耻的目的所进行的各种阴谋活动，是注定要破产的。我们奉劝你们还是收起你们的蛮横无理的所谓“全盘解决”方案为妙，否则你们必将尝到你们自己种下的拖延和破坏停战谈判的苦果。
