    Hellish Scenes on Geoje Island
    —The Bloody Atrocities of the American Side Against Our Captured Personnel in the Geoje Island Prisoner of War Camp
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wang Shu
    The heinous and bloody crimes committed by German fascists in the concentration camps of Treblinka and Auschwitz are still fresh in the minds of the world's people, yet the American aggressors, who are full of "civilization" and "humanity," have created such a slaughterhouse again in Korea. The Geoje Island prisoner of war camp is one of them. The following are the confessions of American special agents Wang Jiati, Liu Chenghan, Mou Bingyun, Tan Guangqing, and others who were captured by our army and served in the 72nd Regiment of the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp, regarding the barbaric crimes committed by the regiment against our captured personnel. From this, one can know how the American side turned Geoje Island into a "terror island."
    The Geoje Island prisoner of war camp was divided into many regiments, each surrounded by two high and wide barbed wire fences. Outside the barbed wire, there were many pillboxes, with strict guards. At night, the huge searchlights of the American and Syngman Rhee bandit security teams shone back and forth on the tents where our captured personnel lived, armored vehicles patrolled around, and the ferocious military dogs often made barking noises. Inside the barbed wire, there were also security teams of the American and Syngman Rhee bandits monitoring the movements of our captured personnel. Anyone who approached the barbed wire would be shot immediately.
    Each tent was crowded with fifty or sixty of our captured personnel. They were deprived of the reasonable treatment that prisoners of war should enjoy, and could not leave the tent casually. They had to obtain permission from the security team to relieve themselves. They could not talk to each other in groups of two or three, otherwise they would be considered to have "resistance suspicion" and be beaten severely. They were starved every day, and each meal consisted of only a bowl of wheat, red beans, or sorghum rice, and a bowl of vegetable soup so thin that one could see their reflection. Our captured personnel were forced to do hard labor every day, building barracks, constructing roads, or loading and unloading military supplies. Many people had their health damaged by this inhumane and heavy labor. Special Agent Wang Jiati, who once served as the principal of the "CIE" special agent school of the 72nd Regiment of the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp, confessed that the American side forced our captured personnel to do steel plate welding work, but did not provide masks to protect their eyes, so that many people's eyes were blinded by the strong light of the oxyacetylene flame.
    Under the instructions of the American aggressors, the special agents of the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee bandits in the prisoner of war camp, who were hated by our captured personnel and called "crippled spirits," "smiling tigers," and "living Yamas," often used extremely minor matters as excuses to impose cruel "punishments" on our captured personnel. Our captured personnel often said: "Being beaten is a thousand times easier than eating." According to Mou Bingyun, a paratrooper special agent who once served as the clerk of the first company of the sixth battalion of the regiment, he personally witnessed in August of last year that one of our captured personnel in the seventh squad was still forced to crush stones when he was sick. Suddenly, a security guard rushed up and slapped him dozens of times, causing his nose to bleed, and also punished him to crawl on the ground for half an hour. The reason was that he hummed the tune of "World Democratic Youth March" while crushing stones. Tan Guangqing, a paratrooper special agent who once served as the captain of the second company of the first battalion of the regiment, confessed to his own crimes of participating in the persecution of our captured personnel. In late April of last year, one of our captured personnel in the second company of the first battalion said, "This little bit of food can only feed mice" because the food he was given was too little. After Tan Guangqing heard this, he beat him severely. Afterwards, the regiment headquarters specially praised him for "strict management."
    The living and sanitary conditions of our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camp were extremely poor, and diseases often spread, and they did not receive due treatment. According to Tan bandit Guangqing, in September of last year, the 72nd Regiment experienced vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness… a disease similar to cholera, which infected more than 2,000 people in two days, but only dozens of people were sent to the poorly equipped hospital, and the rest lay in their tents shouting and groaning. This time, dozens of our captured personnel died. The American prisoner of war camp authorities completely ignored this disease and did not provide due treatment at all.
    Under the direction of the American intelligence agencies "CIC" and "G-2," the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents implemented the darkest fascist terrorist rule in the prisoner of war camp. They closely monitored and controlled the thoughts and actions of our captured personnel, forced our captured personnel to "guarantee each other" and "report each other's ideological situation." The American, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee bandits also ordered those forced to join the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps" to monitor and report the thoughts and actions of our captured personnel. The security team often suddenly dispatched to search the residences and belongings of our captured personnel. Each battalion's security team had a security room, and often arrested our captured personnel who were considered suspicious for illegal torture. According to Tan bandit Guangqing, one of our captured personnel named Li in the 20th squad of the first battalion of the regiment was suspected of organizing a Communist Party group, and was therefore subjected to vicious hanging and beating. He fainted several times and was revived with cold water and then beaten again. After three consecutive days of this, the captured personnel finally committed suicide. According to Mou bandit Bingyun, in November of last year, they forced our captured personnel of the first battalion of the regiment to watch a so-called "drama" that insulted our volunteers. One of our captured personnel named Chen in the first squad of the first battalion sneered when the play began, and was arrested by the security team, who asked him why he laughed. He replied, "This is a 'play', not a real thing!" He was immediately beaten until his whole body was bruised and swollen. Later, they asked him whether the "United Nations army" or the volunteers were better? He said: "The volunteers treat prisoners of war without beating or scolding, and also give them good care in life, but you beat me like this, which one do you think is better?" The next day, he was sent to the American intelligence agency "CIC" in Busan and secretly executed. The special agents of the American intelligence agencies "CIC" and "G-2" stationed on Geoje Island also often went directly to the prisoner of war camp to "understand the mood of the prisoners," and summoned the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents to the "Gendarmerie Command" to report and plan how to persecute our captured personnel. Wang Qi, a paratrooper special agent who was previously captured by our army for collecting intelligence on the effects of enemy bacteriological warfare, also served as a secretary in the fourth battalion of the regiment. According to his confession, during his tenure as secretary, that is, from May to October of last year, only in the six months, more than 900 of our captured personnel in the fourth battalion of the regiment were taken to the aforementioned American intelligence agency for "interrogation." When he was transferred from the prisoner of war camp in mid-November, only more than 500 had returned, and more than 300 had been secretly executed or sentenced to hard labor equivalent to a slow death sentence.
    Because our captured personnel steadfastly resisted the various brutal persecutions of the American side, the American aggressors carried out large-scale bloody massacres against them, attempting to force our captured personnel to submit. According to Tan bandit Guangqing, in June of last year, the first, second, and third battalions of the 72nd Regiment were all captured personnel of the Korean People's Army. Because they were starving every day, they all went on a one-day hunger strike to protest, and gathered together to sing "General Kim Il-sung's Song." The security team of the American and Syngman Rhee bandits immediately dispatched, opened fire on them, and the machine guns on the pillboxes outside the barbed wire also frantically swept, killing thirteen people on the spot. Another time was on the "August 15th" Korean Liberation Day, when our captured personnel in the Busan women's prisoner of war camp were also massacred by the American and Syngman Rhee bandits for singing "General Kim Il-sung's Song," resulting in more than a dozen deaths and injuries.
    According to Mou bandit Bingyun, on October 10 of last year, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents of the 86th Regiment forced our captured personnel to raise the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national flag" and participate in the flag-raising ceremony. Our captured personnel could not tolerate this insult and heroically tore up the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "national flag." Then Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent Li Fang led the security team to inflict beatings on them, killing and wounding more than 20 people on the spot.
    According to Wang bandit Qi, due to the cruel mistreatment of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, resistance actions constantly occurred in the prisoner of war camp. One morning at the end of September of last year, he heard the songs and shouts of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army from the 77th and 78th Regiments near the 72nd Regiment, followed by dense machine gun fire. Later, the small cannons on the armored vehicles also bombarded—this continued for half an hour. About an hour later, he saw the security team and armored vehicles of the American and Syngman Rhee bandits escorting five or six hundred captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, passing through the gate of the 72nd Regiment. Many of the captured personnel were seriously injured, and were supported or carried by their lightly injured or uninjured partners. The security team also tightly drove them with wooden sticks. Afterwards, Wang Qi heard from the Korean translator of the 77th Regiment that the massacre alone killed more than 40 people, and the captured personnel were sent to the even darker 71st Regiment.
    The above bloody facts are only a drop in the bucket of all the crimes committed by the most barbaric cannibals of the 20th century—the American aggressors—against our captured personnel. However, people can clearly see from here what kind of horrific and bloody atrocities are hidden behind the shameless lies of the American aggressors such as "caring about the happiness of prisoners of war" and "giving prisoners of war humane treatment." What a shameless and cruel trick is the so-called "voluntary repatriation" that the American aggressors insist on, which "respects individual freedom of will"!

    巨济岛地狱景象
    ——美方在巨济岛战俘营中残害我方被俘人员的血腥暴行
    新华社记者　王殊
    德国法西斯在特烈勃林卡、奥斯威辛等人间地狱中所犯的令人发指的血腥罪行，在世界人民的脑海中记忆犹新，而满口“文明”和“人道”的美国侵略者，竟又在朝鲜制造了这样的大屠场。巨济岛战俘营就是其中的一个。以下就是被我军捕获的曾在巨济岛战俘营第七十二联队供职的美军特务王家悌、刘承汉、牟秉云、谭广清等所供该联队残害我方被俘人员的野蛮罪行。人们从这里就可以知道，美方怎样把巨济岛变成了一个“恐怖之岛”。
    巨济岛战俘营分成许多联队，每个联队四周围着两道又高又宽的铁丝网，铁丝网外面碉堡林立，警戒森严。夜间，美李匪帮警备队的巨大探照灯，在我方被俘人员所住的帐篷上来回照射，装甲车在四周巡逻，狞恶的军用犬常常发出狺狺的吠声。在铁丝网内，还有美李匪帮的警备队监视着我方被俘人员的行动，谁要靠近铁丝网，就要立即遭到枪击。
    每个帐篷里都拥挤不堪地住着五、六十个我方被俘人员。他们被剥夺了战俘应享受的合理待遇，不能随便走出帐篷，大小便都要经过警备队允许。不能两三个人在一起谈话，否则就要被认为有“反抗嫌疑”而遭到毒打。他们每天挨饿，每顿只能吃到一碗麦粒、赤豆或高粱米做的饭，和一碗可以照清人影的菜汤。我方被俘人员并每天被强迫去作苦工，建造营房，修筑公路或装卸军用物资。许多人都因这种不人道的繁重苦工而损坏了健康。曾任巨济岛战俘营第七十二联队“CIE”特务学校校长的特务王家悌供称：美方强迫我方被俘人员去做焊钢板的工作，却不给保护眼睛的面具，以致不少人的眼睛都被氢氧焰的强光射瞎了。
    在美国侵略者的指使下，被我方被俘人员痛恨地称为“残人精”、“笑面虎”、“活阎王”的战俘营中的蒋李匪帮的特务，经常以极其细小的事情作为藉口，对我方被俘人员施行残酷的“处罚”。我方被俘人员常说：“挨打比吃饭容易一千倍”。据曾任该联队六大队一中队文书的空降特务牟秉云供称，他在去年八月间曾亲眼看见七小队的一位我方被俘人员生了病还被押解去敲石块，突然，警备队员赶上去一连打了他几十下耳光，打得他鼻血直流，还罚他爬在地上半小时。原因是他在敲石块时哼了“世界民主青年进行曲”的调子。曾任该联队一大队二中队队长的空降特务谭广清供认了他自己参加迫害我方被俘人员的罪行；去年四月下旬，一大队二中队一位我方被俘人员因分得的饭太少，说了一句：“这点饭只能喂老鼠”。谭广清听到后，就把他痛打了一顿，事后，该联队队部特为此夸奖他“管理严格”。
    我方被俘人员在战俘营中的生活、卫生条件极为恶劣，经常有疾病流行，而且得不到应有的治疗。据谭匪广清供称：去年九月间，第七十二联队发生了吐泻、头晕……一种类似霍乱的疾病，两天内传染了两千多人，但只有几十个人被送到设备简陋的医院去，其余都躺在帐篷里叫喊呻吟。这次我被俘人员死亡达数十名。对于这种疾病，美国战俘营当局完全置诸不理，根本不给予应有的治疗。
    在美国特务机关“CIC”和“G——二”的指使下，蒋匪特务在战俘营中施行了最黑暗的法西斯恐怖统治。他们严密监视和管制我方被俘人员的思想行动，强迫我方被俘人员互相“连保”，互相“汇报思想情况”。美、蒋、李匪帮并令被迫参加“反共救国团”的人监视和报告我被俘人员的思想和行动。警备队经常突然出动，搜查我方被俘人员的住处和物件。每个大队的警备队都设有警备室，经常把被认为可疑的我方被俘人员抓去进行非法刑讯。据谭匪广清供称：该联队一大队二十小队一位姓李的我方被俘人员，被怀疑组织共产党小组，因而遭到毒辣的吊打，几次昏死过去又用冷水浇醒过来再打，这样一连打了三天，这位我方被俘人员终于自杀。又据牟匪秉云供称：去年十一月间，他们强迫该联队一大队的我方被俘人员去看侮辱我志愿军的所谓“话剧”。一大队一小队一位姓陈的我方被俘人员在开演时冷笑了一下，就被警备队抓起来，问他为什么笑。他回答说“这是‘戏’，不是真事！”顿时就被打得浑身青肿。以后又问他“联合国军”好还是志愿军好？他说：“志愿军对待战俘不打不骂，还在生活上给予很好的照顾，而你们把我打成这个样子，你说哪个好？”第二天，他就被送到釜山的美国特务机关“CIC”秘密处死了。美国特务机关“CIC”和“G——二”驻在巨济岛的特务，也常直接到战俘营去“了解俘虏情绪”，召集蒋匪特务到“宪兵司令部”去汇报，计划如何对我方被俘人员进行迫害。前被我军捕获的前来收集敌细菌战效果情报的空降特务王琦，也曾在该联队四大队担任书记职务。据他供称，在他任书记期间，即从去年五月到十月的六个月中间，仅该联队四大队就有九百多名我方被俘人员被押到上述美国特务机关去“审讯”，到十一月中旬他调离战俘营时，只有五百多个回来，有三百多个已被秘密处死或罚处等于慢性死刑的苦重劳役。
    由于我方被俘人员坚定不移地反抗美方的种种残暴迫害，美国侵略者就对他们进行了大规模的血腥屠杀，妄图迫使我方被俘人员屈服。据谭匪广清供称：在去年六月时，第七十二联队的第一、二、三大队还都是朝鲜人民军的被俘人员，他们因为每天挨饿，就全体绝食一天，表示抗议，并聚在一起高唱“金日成将军之歌”。美李匪帮的警备队马上出动，向他们开枪射击，铁丝网外面碉堡上的机枪也疯狂扫射，当场就打死了十三个人。又一次是在去年“八一五”朝鲜解放纪念日，釜山女战俘营中我方被俘人员也因高唱“金日成将军之歌”而遭到美李匪帮的屠杀，死伤十余名。
    据牟匪秉云供称：去年十月十日，第八十六联队的蒋匪特务强迫我方被俘人员升蒋匪“国旗”和参加升旗典礼。我方被俘人员不能忍受这种侮辱，英勇地将蒋匪“国旗”撕碎。于是蒋匪特务李芳就带着警备队对他们施行毒打，当场打死打伤二十多名。
    据王匪琦供称：由于美蒋匪帮的残酷虐待，俘虏营中不断发生反抗行动。去年九月底的一天上午，他听见第七十二联队附近的第七十七和七十八联队传出了朝鲜人民军被俘人员的歌声和叫喊声，接着就是密如连珠的机枪声，以后，装甲车上的小炮也轰击起来——这样继续了半个钟点。又隔了一个小时左右，他就看见美李匪帮的警备队和装甲车押着五、六百位朝鲜人民军被俘人员，从第七十二联队门口走过。被俘人员中许多人都负了重伤，被轻伤者或没有负伤的伙伴扶着或抬着走。警备队还拿着木棍紧紧地赶他们。事后，王琦听第七十七联队的朝鲜翻译说，这场大屠杀单打死的就有四十多名，那批被俘人员则被送到更加黑暗的第七十一联队去了。
    上述这些血淋淋的事实，只是二十世纪最野蛮的吃人生番——美国侵略者残害我方被俘人员的全部罪行中的点滴。但是，人们从这里可以清楚地看到掩藏在美国侵略者“关心战俘幸福”、“给予战俘人道待遇”等无耻谎言后面的是何等惨绝人寰的血腥暴行。美国侵略者坚持主张的所谓“尊重个人自由意志”的“自愿遣返”是一个何等无耻、何等残忍的骗局！
