Xinhua News Agency, 16th: TASS, New York, 15th: The Soviet delegation to the United Nations submitted the following letter to the United Nations Secretariat on May 14: "The delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the United Nations hereby notifies the United Nations Secretariat that this delegation has received a protest from the World Federation of Democratic Youth against the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States armed forces in China and Korea.

We request that you print this letter and the attached protest from the World Federation of Democratic Youth as a document of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, and distribute this document to the member states of the Commission and the delegations of the member states of the United Nations."

The protest from the World Federation of Democratic Youth is as follows: "In the name of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing over 72 million young men and women in 84 countries, we lodge our vehement and resolute protest against the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States armed forces against the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and civilians in both Korea and China.

Life unfolds a bright future for young people, and in order to defend this life, young people are particularly determined and uncompromising. The towering crimes of the American aggressors disgust and horrify all young men and women. These crimes compel everyone to strongly demand an effective ban on bacteriological weapons, which are already prohibited by international law.

The undeniable truth is becoming increasingly clear, and the youth protests are rising day by day.

It is precisely for this reason that, in the name of the will of youth, in the name of life, and in the name of human dignity, we demand that the United Nations Disarmament Commission order all member states of the United Nations to immediately ratify the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925.

We firmly believe that as long as we resolutely take the road of disarmament, we can ensure the security of all countries and world peace; and we believe that the United Nations Disarmament Commission cannot betray the trust and expectations of mankind. Therefore, we demand that the Disarmament Commission immediately take appropriate and necessary measures to effectively prohibit the use of any weapons of mass destruction—whether bacteriological, chemical, or atomic—and ensure effective supervision of all countries' compliance with this ban.

You are entrusted by the people to protect the rights of civilized humanity, and you cannot remain passive in the face of these obvious atrocities against defenseless people. Therefore, in the name of all youth, we request that the United Nations Disarmament Commission make appropriate decisions to save the world from terrible suffering.

World Federation of Democratic Youth Secretary, Williams

    世界民主青联写信给苏联驻联合国代表团
    要求裁军委员会制止美国进行细菌战
    苏联代表团请联合国秘书处作为文件印发各国
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社纽约十五日讯：苏联驻联合国代表团于五月十四日将下述信件递交给联合国秘书处：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻联合国代表团兹通知联合国秘书处：本代表团收到了世界民主青年联盟对美国武装部队在中国和朝鲜使用细菌武器的抗议书。
    我们请求贵处将本函件及随函附上的世界民主青年联盟的抗议书印发为联合国裁减军备委员会的文件，并将这文件分发给该委员会诸会员国及联合国各会员国代表团。”
    世界民主青年联盟的抗议书如下：“我们以代表八十四个国家七千二百余万男女青年的世界民主青年联盟的名义，对于美国武装部队对朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军以及朝中两国平民使用细菌武器的行为，向你们提出青年们的激烈而坚决的抗议。
    生命为青年展开着光辉的前途，为了保卫这生命，青年们特别坚决，不顾一切。对于美国侵略者的滔天罪行使无论什么样的男女青年都感到恶心和毛骨悚然。这种罪行促使每一个人强烈地要求对于国际法本来已经禁止的细菌武器加以有效的禁止。
    无可否认的事实真相愈来愈是明显，青年的抗议也一天比一天高涨。
    正是因为这样，所以我们以青年意志的名义，以生命的名义，以人类尊严的名义，要求联合国裁减军备委员会令联合国各会员国立即批准一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书。
    我们深信，只要坚决地走裁减军备的道路，我们就能保证各国的安全和世界和平；我们并相信联合国裁减军备委员会不能辜负人类的信托和期望。所以，我们要求裁减军备委员会马上采取适当的必要措施，以便有效地禁止使用任何大规模毁灭的武器——无论是细菌武器，化学武器，或者是原子武器，并确保切实监督各国遵守这个禁令。
    你们是受人民委托来保护文明人类的权利的，眼看着这些对手无寸铁的人民的明显暴行，你们不能保持消极态度。因此，我们以全体青年的名义，请求联合国裁减军备委员会作出适当的决定，以使世界免于可怖的痛苦。
    世界民主青年联盟书记　威廉士
