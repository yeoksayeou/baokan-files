Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    Editorial and Review Department of the People's Education Press
    Accepts Suggestions for Unified Textbook Translations
    To the Editor: We completely accept the letter from the History and Geography Teaching and Research Group of Jinan First Middle School, published in the People's Daily on May 14, suggesting that the translations of foreign history and geography textbook names and place names be unified. In the past, we have handled and replied to many similar letters you have forwarded to us.
    In the past, we only concentrated on solving the problem of textbook supply, and the editorial work was very rough in many places; there were even more serious errors than inconsistent translations, which should be reviewed.
    Now we have established an inspection section to check whether the proper names, translations, academic terms, and quoted figures (including dates, populations, outputs, areas, mileages, altitudes, etc.) in the manuscripts are correct and consistent, to check whether the illustrations are consistent with the text, to check whether the grammar, punctuation, and text shapes are correct, and to verify whether the quotations are accurate. In order to collect correct and unified authoritative data, we have contacted the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the relevant ministries of the Central People's Government, asking them to give us as much help as possible. We plan to start with a detailed inspection of the newly compiled textbooks to be supplied in the autumn of 1952, and gradually achieve correctness, consistency, and error-free books.
    We sincerely hope that teachers in various regions will provide feedback on the textbooks and help us do a good job in publishing textbooks.

### 人民教育出版社编审部  接受统一教科书译名的建议

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    人民教育出版社编审部
    接受统一教科书译名的建议
    编辑同志：人民日报五月十四日刊载了济南第一中学史地教学研究组的来信，建议把外国史地教科书中人名和地名的译名统一起来；我们完全接受这一建议。过去承你们转来的不少类似函件，我们都分别处理并函复了。
    过去我们只集中力量解决教科书的供应问题，编审工作在许多地方做得很粗疏；甚至还有比译名不统一更严重的错误，这是应该检讨的。
    现在我们已经成立了检查科，检查书稿中专名、译名、学术用语、引用数字（包括年月日、人口、产量、面积、里程、海拔等）是否正确和一致，检查插图和正文是否符合，检查语法、标点、文字体形是否正确，并核对引文是否有误。为了收集正确而统一的权威资料，我们曾向中国科学院和中央人民政府有关各部联系，请他们尽量给我们以帮助。我们准备先从一九五二年秋季供应的新编课本中，进行详细的检查，逐步做到正确、统一、没有错误。
    我们诚恳地希望各地教师对课本提出意见，帮助我们做好教科书的出版工作。
