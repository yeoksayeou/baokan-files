Experiences in Key Rural Experiments with the "Accelerated Literacy Method"
Hebei Miyang County People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education

	We used the winter vacation to conduct experiments with the "Accelerated Literacy Method" in Mazhuang Village, Hangang Township, Shuangmiao District of our county. After thirty days of teaching (four hours of study per day), a final test of forty-one people (including twenty-one illiterates, eleven who knew less than fifty characters, and nine who knew less than one hundred and fifty characters; including thirty-six young and middle-aged people and five elderly people) showed that twenty-two people could recognize 1,400 characters, eight could recognize 960 characters, and eleven could recognize 480 characters. Twenty-two people could read popular publications (such as the Henan Dazhong Daily), eight could read roughly, and eleven could read slightly. Eleven people could use a dictionary. Eighteen people could write simple letters, eleven could write single characters, and nine were poor at writing single characters. This fully demonstrates that the "Accelerated Literacy Method" is not only applicable to the military, but also fully applicable to rural areas. We will now introduce our experimental situation for reference in promoting the "Accelerated Literacy Method" in rural areas.

	I. Make Good Preparations

	Before conducting "Accelerated Literacy" teaching, ideological mobilization should first be carried out. Because ordinary farmers are scattered in their lives and lack organization and discipline, but the promotion of the "Accelerated Literacy Method" must rely on organization and discipline. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize students to recognize the importance of learning culture, increase their enthusiasm for learning, and make them take the initiative to learn. Then, further explain the advantages of the "Accelerated Literacy Method" (short time, great results) and the reasons for its "acceleration" and what conditions are required to "accelerate." Then organize them to discuss and formulate learning plans and learning systems (the main contents are to abide by time, help each other learn, not fall behind, and review at any time). Teachers also make guarantees, jointly implement them, and supervise each other so that learning quickly gets on the right track.

	Secondly, organizational leadership should be strengthened. Experience has shown that grouping and classing (each class should have fewer than 50 people, preferably with two teachers), electing group leaders and class leaders, giving play to the role of village cadres, school directors, and private school teachers, strengthening organizational leadership, and solving specific problems in learning is a very important task. The success of this pilot "Accelerated Literacy Method" was mainly due to the active assistance of village representative Li Baoxing and private school teacher Li Chenghua. In addition, use methods of praise, criticism, and challenges to encourage students' learning emotions and insist on starting and ending classes on time. According to our experiment, learning time is best at two hours in the afternoon and two hours in the evening.

	Before conducting "Accelerated Literacy" teaching, the following teaching aids must also be available: (1) A single volume of phonetic symbols. We compiled 1,500 commonly used characters into single-character teaching materials in the usual order of phonetic symbols. The characters under each symbol or Pinyin are arranged in the order of the four tones, with the aim of distinguishing the pronunciation of the characters from the four tones, learning the four tones to facilitate looking up the dictionary, and printing a table of radicals and a four-tone learning song on the teaching materials to help students learn single characters. This single volume was compiled and printed by ourselves, and each student received a free copy. (2) Illustrated phonetic symbols. Write out the phonetic symbols, attach pictures, and paste them in the classroom. (3) Phonetic symbol learning chart. Write all the phonetic symbols on large paper and paste them in the classroom. (4) Phonetic single-character cards. Make a set of samples and mobilize students to imitate them. (5) New word cards. With Pinyin on the back, make a set for the whole class and mobilize students to make their own. (6) Popular reading materials.

	II. How to Conduct Teaching

	According to our experimental experience, the teaching methods of "Accelerated Literacy" can be divided into the following three steps:

	The first step is to teach phonetic symbols and enable students to spell and recognize characters. The teaching method of phonetic symbols is to first paste the illustrated phonetic symbols in the classroom, and teach them in order from "ㄅ". The teacher reads one character, and the students follow to read one character until it is read correctly. At the beginning, it is not necessary to require that they must remember which is a phonetic symbol, which is a medial, and which is a vowel. Once they are familiar with reading, they will naturally use it. Secondly, each phonetic symbol should be made image-like to help memory. For example, explain that the character "ㄩ" is like a "fish basin," the character "冖" is like a "whetstone," the character "ㄍ" is like two "cow shuttles," and the character "ㄎ" is like a "stooped old lady," etc. Some unnecessary pronunciations, such as "wan," "wu," and "guang," can be canceled, and "ㄜ" and "ㄛ" can only teach one, but for the convenience of looking up the dictionary, all can also be taught. In addition, using phonetic cards to practice "moving" during individual tutoring or group study is very effective. Furthermore, pay attention to mutual teaching and learning, and strengthen individual tutoring to help students who are lagging behind.

	After all the phonetic symbols are taught thoroughly (three days is enough), you can start teaching Pinyin character recognition (four days are needed, and those who are slow to learn can continue to learn in the second step). The method of teaching Pinyin is to first teach single-sound characters, such as "ㄨ" (wu) and "ㄗ" (zi); then teach double-sound combined characters; but double-sound spelling characters should first teach double-sound phonetic symbols, such as "彳ㄨ" (chu), "ㄉ-" (di), and then teach combined rhyme symbols, such as "ㄨ尢" (wang) and "-尢" (yang). After learning how to spell double-sound characters, teach how to spell three-sound characters. There are two ways to teach this: one is to spell the initial and medial, and then spell it with the final to get the sound, such as the character "公" (gong), which can be spelled as "ㄍㄨ" "谷ㄥ". The other is to spell three sounds at once to get the sound, such as the character "粮" (liang), which can be spelled as "ㄌ-尢" (liang). However, the former pronunciation is more accurate, and the latter spelling is simpler. After single sounds, double sounds, and triple sounds have all been taught, the teacher can use the way of "tongue twisters" to spell characters with Pinyin. Regardless of whether it is a two-sound spelling or a three-sound spelling, the teacher "slips" whenever there is a character, and the students follow the "slip", from slow to fast (especially when spelling three sounds). Because most of the students are adults, their lips and tongues are not flexible, and it is difficult to pronounce them. This method can be used to practice the students' agility of speech and smooth pronunciation. After this method is practiced, students can also say the words and the teacher spells them, or the teacher says the words and the students spell them.

	When starting to teach phonetic symbols, it is necessary to explain to the students that phonetic symbols are the main tool for "Accelerated Literacy", and the quality of phonetic symbol learning is the key to the success or failure of "Accelerated Literacy". And give examples to illustrate the function of phonetic symbols, such as learning "ㄅ", you will learn many characters such as "剥" (bo), "菠" (bo), and "拨" (bo), to attract students' attention and improve their interest in learning.

	The second step is to study the textbook, intensively learn single characters, so that students can initially recognize them and simply speak them. After learning the phonetic symbols and being able to spell characters, you can carry out a blitz according to the phonetic single-character book, character by character and line by line. The method is to first read the phonetic symbols, then read the Pinyin, and closely follow the Pinyin to read the single characters, such as "ㄅ丫" is a "八" (ba), followed by: "扒, 把, 吧, 巴, 拔, 霸" and other homophones. And the reading of the character sound should be combined with the explanation of the meaning of the character, such as "ㄅ丫" "扒" (ba), that is, lead the reading "扒" is "扒粪的扒" (ba fen de ba, the ba of raking manure), "拔" (ba) is "拔草的拔" (ba cao de ba, the ba of pulling weeds), etc. When explaining the meaning of the character, only explain one general one, and pay attention to being easy to understand (combine with farmers' lives), simple and concise, don't explain one character too much or for too long, so that students are annoyed (because adults have strong associations) or create confusion. In addition, the general radicals can be picked out and written on large paper. Before teaching single characters, first recognize seven or eight to lay the foundation for learning to look up the dictionary. In this stage, it is important to note that you must be fully prepared before teaching single characters, so as not to speak inappropriately when speaking. At the same time, properly grasp the teaching progress, not too fast or too slow, and take the level of intermediate students as the standard. For students who are older or have poor memory due to other reasons, teachers should use more individual tutoring, patiently help, and help them in many ways to eliminate their worries. Do not make them feel pessimistic and disappointed because they learn slowly and cannot remember.

	The third step is to organize reviews, consolidate existing achievements, start reading, and practice writing. After the above intensive study stage, you should chew slowly and thoroughly, and use the methods of "one reading, two questions, and three discussions" to review the characters you have learned before. The so-called "one reading" is that the teacher randomly points to a character and asks the students how to read it, "two questions" is that the teacher asks how to explain a certain character, and "three discussions" is that everyone discusses the shape, stroke, usage, spelling, and explanation of the character. According to our experience, it is advisable to review 150 characters every two hours. After reviewing with the above methods, disrupt the ranks, discard the "crutches" (that is, phonetic symbols), extract one hundred to two hundred characters from the characters you have learned, and write them on the blackboard. The teacher first teaches three or four times, then selects the top students to read and explain them in turn, and the rest of the students listen quietly, and if they find any mistakes, they propose corrections. After the top students have read it many times, the other students will read it again. After the top students have read and explained it many times, the poorer students will also learn it.

	After repeated reviews, the characters that have been learned before have been basically consolidated, and then reading can be carried out. There are two ways to read: one is self-selected reading, that is, from many popular reading materials, students choose what they like to read, and if they encounter unfamiliar characters, students can ask them, and the teacher should answer them at any time. The other is group reading, that is, find a reading material (such as popular newspapers and periodicals) in the group, and all students in the group take turns reading and teach and learn from each other the characters they do not know. At the same time as reading, you can also combine teaching to look up dictionaries. Since the radicals and character stroke have been learned in the previous stage, there will not be much difficulty at this time. Students are very interested in this and learn quickly.

	At the same time as reviewing, you should start teaching students to practice writing. Before writing, explain the writing method: from top to bottom, from left to right, from outside to inside. Because they are beginners in writing, they will inevitably have trembling fingers and difficulty holding the pen. At this time, you can let them write simple characters first (such as phonetic letters, etc.), and often encourage them, so that they will not be discouraged because they cannot write well. As long as the time is long and you write more, you will naturally write well. Only by slowly guiding them forward in this way will they gradually make their writing gradually change from crooked to correct, from bad to good. After that, you can teach them to learn to record things, write words, etc.

	III. A Few Thoughts

	According to our experience, to promote the "Accelerated Literacy Method" in rural areas, first of all, you must choose the slack farming season. On the one hand, it can make students concentrate on learning, and on the other hand, it can seize the time to complete the teaching plan intensively, because this "method" cannot be delayed for a long time, otherwise, it will make students slack in their learning emotions and lose confidence. Secondly, in rural areas, to carry out "Accelerated Literacy" learning, special attention should be paid to ideological mobilization, because one of the characteristics of the "Accelerated Literacy Method" is that it requires the teaching plan to be completed in a short period of time, so students must abide by the learning time and abide by the learning discipline. Because farmers are scattered in their lives and lack discipline, only by mobilizing them well and organizing them on the principle of voluntary participation can the effect of "acceleration" be achieved. In addition, teachers should closely contact the masses, become one with the students, establish feelings, understand the situation in a timely manner, do a good job of individual visits, and pay attention to respecting and encouraging students in management.

    在农村重点试验“速成识字法”的经验
    河南泌阳县人民政府文教科
    我们利用寒假，在本县双庙区韩岗乡马庄村作了“速成识字法”的试验工作。经过了三十天的教学
    （每天学习四小时），四十一人（其中文盲二十一人，识五十字以下的十一人，识一百五十字以下者九人；其中青壮年三十六人，老年五人）最后测验的结果，识一千四百字者二十二人，识九百六十字者八人，识四百八十字者十一人。能读通俗刊物（如河南大众报等）者二十二人，能粗读者八人，能略读者十一人。能查字典者十一人。能写简单信件者十八人，能写单字者十一人，写单字较差者九人。这就充分说明了“速成识字法”不仅适用于部队，而且完全适用于农村。今将我们实验的情况介绍出来，供在农村推行“速成识字法”的参考。
    一、作好准备工作
    在进行“速成识字”教学前，首先应作好思想动员工作。因为一般农民生活散漫，缺乏组织性和纪律性，但推行“速成识字法”是必须依靠组织性和纪律性的。因此，必需动员学员认识学习文化的重要，提高其学习积极性，使其主动地学习。然后再进一步说明“速成识字法”的优点（时间短、成绩大）及其所以“速成”的道理和怎样才能“速成”，想
    “速成”得具备那些条件等。接着组织他们讨论订立学习计划和学习制度（主要内容是遵守时间，互助学习，不落人后，随时温习），教师也提出保证，共同执行，互相监督，使学习很快地走入正轨。
    其次应加强组织领导。经验证明：分组分班（每班五十人以下，教师二人为宜），选举组长班长，发挥乡村干部、校董、民校教师的作用，加强组织领导，解决学习中的具体问题，是一项很重要的工作。这次试行“速成识字法”的成功，重要的原因是受到村代表李保兴和民校教师李成华等的积极帮助。另外要运用表扬、批评和挑战的办法，来鼓舞学员的学习情绪，并坚持按时上课下课。据我们试验，学习时间以下午两小时，晚上两小时为最宜。
    进行“速成识字”教学前，还必须具备以下几种教具：（1）注音符号单本。我们是将普通常用字一千五百个，以注音符号平常的顺序编成单字教材。每个符号或拼音下面的字，以四音次序排列，目的在于从四音中辨别字音，学会四音便于查字典，并在教材上印上部首学习表及四音学习歌，帮助学员学习单字。这种单本是我们自己编印的，每个学员免费发给一册。（2）带图注音符号。把注音符号写出来，附上图，贴在教室内。（3）注音符号学习表。用大纸把全部注音符号写出贴在教室内。（4）注音单字卡片。做好一套样子，发动学员自己仿做。（5）生字卡片。背面带拼音，全班做一套，发动学员自己做。（6）通俗读物。
    二、怎样进行教学
    “速成识字”的教学方法，根据我们试验的经验，可分为以下三个步骤进行：
    第一步，要教会注音符号，并使学员会拼音认字。注音符号的教法，我们是先把带图的注音符号贴在教室里，自“ㄅ”起依次下教，教师念一字，学员跟着念一字，直到念正确为止。开始时不必要求一定记住那是音符，那是介符，那是韵符，一待念熟，自然会用。其次，要把每个注音符号使其形象化，以便帮助记忆。如说明“ㄩ”字像“鱼盆”，
    “冖”字像“磨刀石”，“ㄍ”字像两个“牛梭头”，“ㄎ”字像个弯腰的“老奶奶”等。有些不必要的注音，像“万”“兀”“广”等可以取消，“ㄜ”“ㄛ”可只教一个，但为了查字典方便，也可以全部教授。另外，利用注音卡片，在个别辅导或小组学习时练习“搬家”是非常有效的。再，还要注意互教互学，加强个别辅导，以帮助学习差的学员。
    注音符号全部教熟以后（三天即可），即可开始教拼音认字（需要四天，个别学习差的可在第二步时继续学习）。教拼音的方法是先教单音字，如
    “ㄨ”（物）“ㄗ”（资）等；次教双音相拼字；但双音拼字还应先教双音声符，如“彳ㄨ”（锄），
    “ㄉ—”（地），后教结合韵符，如“ㄨ尢”（汪），
    “—尢”（洋）。双音拼字学会了，再教三音相拼。这有两种教法：一种是声符和介符相拼，拼后再和韵符相拼，得出音来，如“公”字可拼作“ㄍㄨ”“谷ㄥ”。一种是三音一拼，得出音来，如
    “粮”字可拼作“ㄌ—尢”（粮）。不过前者发音较正确，后者拼音较简单。单音、双音、三音都教会了，教师就可以用“顺口溜”的方式，用注音拼字，不管二音拼或三音拼，教师逢字便“溜”，学员跟着“溜”，速度由慢到快（特别三拼音时尤应如此）。因为学员多系成年人，唇舌不灵活，发音困难，采用此法可以练习学员口齿灵利，发音顺畅。此法在练习熟练之后，亦可采取学员说字教师拼，或教师说字学员拼的方法。
    在开始教注音符号时，必需跟学员说明：注音符号是“速成识字”的主要工具，音符学习的好坏是
    “速成识字”的成败关键。并举例说明注音符号的功用，如学习了“ㄅ”，便学会了“剥”“菠”
    “拨”等许多字，以提起学员的注意，并提高他们的学习兴趣。
    第二步，学习教材，突击学单字，使学员初步会认并简单会讲。注音符号学会以后，会拼音认字了，就可根据注音单字本，逐字逐行进行突击。方法是先读注音，后读拼音，紧跟拼音读单字，如“ㄅ丫”是个“八”，后边跟着就是：“扒、把、吧、巴、拔、霸”等同音单字。并且要把读字音和讲解字义结合起来进行，如“ㄅ丫”“扒”，即领念“扒”是“扒粪的扒”，“拔”是“拔草的拔”等。讲解字义时只讲一个通用的即可，并要注意通俗易懂（结合农民生活讲），简单扼要，不要一个字讲得过多，拉得时间太长，使学员厌烦（因为成年人联想力较强）或造成混乱。另外还可把通用的部首挑出来，写在大幅纸上，在教单字之前先认七、八个，以打下学习查字典的基础。在这一阶段需注意的是：在教单字前，一定要有充分准备，以免讲时讲得不恰当。同时要适当掌握教学进度，不要太快或太慢，要以中等学员的水平为标准。对年龄大或因其他关系记忆力较差的学员，教师要多用个别辅导，耐心帮助，解除顾虑的方法多加帮助，千万勿使其因学得慢、记不住而感到悲观失望。
    第三步，组织复习，巩固已有成绩，展开阅读，并练习写话。经过以上的突击学习阶段后，就应细嚼烂咽，把以前所学过的字，利用“一读、二问、三讨论”的办法，进行复习。所谓“一读”是教师随便指一个字问学员的读法，“二问”是教师问某字的讲法，“三讨论”是大家一起讨论字形、笔划、用法、拼音、讲解等。我们的经验，以每两小时复习一百五十字为宜。用以上办法复习后，再打乱阵营，丢掉“拐棍”（即注音符号），把所学过的字抽出一百到二百字，写在黑板上，教师先教三四遍后，然后挑选优等生依次念讲，其余学生静听，发现错误就提出更正。优等生念后，其他学员再念。经过优等生的多次念讲，差一些的学员也就学会了。
    经过反复的复习，以前所学的字都已得到基本巩固后，即可进行阅读。阅读的方法有两种：一种是自选自读，即从许多通俗读物中，由学员自己选择自己喜爱读的来读，遇有不识的字，学员可以提出来问，教师要随时解答。另一种是小组轮读，即在小组中找一读物（如通俗报刊等），全组学员轮流阅读，不认识的字互教互学。在阅读的同时，还可结合教查字典。由于前一段已学习了部首和字形笔划，这时就不致发生多大困难。学员对此非常有兴趣，学会的也快。
    在复习的同时，就要开始教学员练习写字。写以前，要说明写字的方法：自上而下，自左而右，自外而内。由于他们是初学写字，不免有些手指颤抖，拿笔不便。这时可让他们先写简单的字（如注音字母等），并时常鼓励他们，不要使他们因写不好而灰心丧气。只要时间长，写得多了，自然就会写好。只有这样慢慢地引导他们前进，才会使他们写的字逐渐地由歪而正，由坏而好。此后即可教他们学记事、写话等。
    三、几点体会
    根据我们的经验，在农村推行“速成识字法”，首先，必须选择农闲时期，这一则可以使学员专心学习，二则可以抓紧时间突击完成教学计划，因为此“法”不能拖长时间，否则会使学员学习情绪松懈，失掉信心。其次在农村开展“速成识字”学习，应特别重视思想发动工作，因为“速成识字法”的特点之一就是要求短期完成教学计划，所以必须让学员遵守学习时间，遵守学习纪律，因农民生活散漫，缺乏纪律性，所以只有很好地动员他们，在自觉自愿的原则下把他们组织起来，才能收到“速成”的效果。另外，教师应密切联系群众，和学员打成一片，建立感情，及时了解情况，作好个别访问，并在管理上注意尊重学员，注意鼓励学员前进。
