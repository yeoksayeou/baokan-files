    Employees of the China Native Produce Company Suzhou Branch
    Vigorously Promote Native Produce Purchase and Sales

    To the Editor: Since April, the employees of our China Native Produce Company Suzhou Branch have purchased a large number of industrial products, handicrafts, and local specialties in rural and urban areas, with a total investment of 18 billion yuan. In addition, we have also promoted various goods (to North China, Northeast China, and other places) outside the region, with a total value of more than 5 billion yuan.

    The velvet, embroidery, silk weaving, and other industries in Suzhou are currently in the off-season, with a large backlog of products and difficulties in production funding. Our company first approached those industrial and commercial households in these three industries who had thoroughly confessed their problems in the "Five-Anti" movement and purchased their inventory. For example, the velvet industry had a backlog of 15,000 meters of velvet, and we immediately ordered 20,000 meters, which not only solved the industry's sales difficulties but also solved the difficulties in reproduction. At the same time, we purchased 11,000 pieces of silk cloth, 5,000 meters of soft satin, 2,000 embroidered quilt covers, and 10,000 pairs of pillowcases, which basically solved their production difficulties. In order to help citizens engage in sideline production, we entrusted 1,800 quilt covers and 3,000 pairs of pillows to citizens and the Guangfu Cooperative for embroidery processing.

    We have also purchased grass mats, hogs, duck eggs, homespun cloth, rain capes, and bamboo hats in the rural areas of the Suzhou Special District. The purchase of these products has solved the difficulties of some farmers in purchasing means of production and living materials during the slack season, and has effectively promoted the agricultural production increase movement and sideline production. There was a backlog of live pigs in the local area, and we vigorously purchased them, having already purchased 5,000 hogs and transported them to Shanghai and other places for sale.

    These achievements are all a manifestation of the increased enthusiasm of all the employees in our company after the "Three-Anti" movement.

    中国土产公司苏州支公司职工
    大力开展土产购销工作
    编辑同志：我们中国土产公司苏州支公司的职工，从四月份起，在农村和城市收购了大批的工业品、手工业品以及土特产品，计投放资金达一百八十亿元。另外又到本区外推销（华北、东北等地）各种货品，总值达五十多亿元。
    苏州市的?绒、刺绣、丝织等业，目前正处于淡季，积压的产品很多，生产资金发生困难。我们公司首先找这三个行业内在“五反”运动中交代问题比较彻底的工商户，收购他们的存货。如?绒业积压了一万五千公尺的?绒，我们一下就订购了二万公尺，这样不但解决了该业推销上的困难，并且解决了再生产的困难。同时我们收购了绸布面一万一千条、软缎五千公尺，绣花被面二千条、枕套一万对，基本上解决了他们生产上的困难。为了帮助市民进行副业生产，我们把一千八百条被面、三千对枕头，委托市民及光福合作社绣花加工。
    我们又在苏州专区农村中收购草席、毛猪、鸭蛋、土布、蓑衣、笠帽等产品。收购这些产品，解决了部分农民在青黄不接时购买生产资料和生活资料的困难，有力地促进了农业增产运动及副业生产。当地毛猪曾发生滞销现象，我们大力进行收购，已购进毛猪五千头，运往上海等地推销。
    这些成绩，都是我们公司里的全体职工在“三反”运动后，工作积极性提高了的表现。
