The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team, which created the highest cotton yield in the country, completed the planting of 96.4 mu of cotton fields on April 14th. Some of the earlier planted cotton fields have already sprouted tender green and robust cotton seedlings.

This year, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team further improved its cotton cultivation techniques. Before planting, all cotton fields were plowed four times, harrowed and rolled twelve times, making the soil loose and increasing moisture retention. Each mu of cotton field was fertilized with an average of 9,500 jin of manure. The three mu of high-yield land were fertilized with 13,000 jin of various kinds of manure and 100 jin of bone meal per mu. Weeds in the fields, roadsides, and well sides have been cleared to prevent the breeding of cotton aphid larvae. The Si Zi 4B cotton seeds they planted were all selected by plant in the field, grain selected, turned over and disinfected. Therefore, this year's cotton seedlings are growing very uniformly, generally emerging one day earlier than last year, and two days earlier than the same variety planted by local farmers.

During the spring plowing period, the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team also absorbed six individual farmers into the team. The farming techniques of these six farmers are relatively low. Their cotton fields cannot meet the cultivation standards of the old team members' cotton fields this year, and the yield will not meet the requirements of the entire team. However, with the help of the whole team, their paddy and dry land cotton fields have all been plowed three times, harrowed once, and rolled seven times. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu has also increased from 800 jin last year to more than 4,000 jin. They also added two wells and a waterwheel.

The Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team held a meeting of all team members and formulated a plan for summer cotton field management. The plan stipulates: 1. All cotton fields in the team must use the method of early thinning, dense seedling retention, and late seedling setting, so as to achieve dense planting and full seedlings. Row spacing should be two chi, and plant spacing should be eight or nine cun. Retain 3,000 to 3,500 seedlings per mu of cotton field. 2. Weed the cotton fields nine times, remove weeds from the fields, top and prune in a timely manner, and improve pruning techniques. 3. Be vigilant about the occurrence of cotton aphid pests (the Qu Yaoli Mutual Aid Team has now prepared 9,000 jin of pesticides such as cotton oil soap, pyrethrum emulsion, and DDT, and two sprayers), and promptly eliminate cotton aphids, red spiders, and other pests. 4. Apply top dressing to all cotton fields in three stages, with a total application of 855 jin of fertilizer field powder. Apply 20 jin of fertilizer field powder per mu of high-yield land. 5. When irrigating, appropriately coordinate with rainfall, and adopt reasonable watering methods of frequent and light watering. If there is a drought, the number of irrigations this year will increase from seven times last year to thirteen times. In their plan, they proposed to carry out competitions among team members within the mutual aid team, and to disseminate various cotton planting techniques that have been successfully tested to farmers outside the team in a timely manner.

    曲耀离互助组完成棉田的播种工作
    全体组员开会订出夏季棉田管理的计划
    创造全国棉花最高产量的曲耀离互助组，已在四月十四日完成了九十六亩四分棉田的播种工作。有些早种的棉田已长出了嫩绿而又健壮的棉苗。
    今年曲耀离互助组进一步改进了耕耘棉花的技术。播种前，全部棉田耕过四遍，耙、耱十二次，使土壤松软，含蓄水分增多。每亩棉田平均施肥九千五百斤，三亩丰产地每亩施了各种粪肥一万三千斤，骨粉一百斤。田间、路旁和井边的杂草都已除净，以防棉蚜幼虫的寄生。他们播种的斯字四Ｂ棉籽都是经过田间株选、粒选、翻晒和消毒的。所以今年的棉苗长得很整齐，一般比去年早出土一天，比当地农民所种同一品种早出土两天。
    春耕期间曲耀离互助组又吸收了六户单干农民入组。这六户农民耕作技术都比较低，他们的棉田今年还不能达到旧组员棉田的耕作标准，产量也达不到全组的要求。但是，在全组的帮助下他们的水旱棉田都作到了耕三、耙一、耱七次，每亩施肥量也由去年的八百斤增加到四千多斤，还增加了两眼水井和一部水车。
    曲耀离互助组曾举行全体组员会议，订出了夏季棉田管理的计划。计划规定：一、全组棉田要使用早间苗、密留苗、晚定苗的作法，做到密植苗全。行距二尺、株距八、九寸。每亩棉田留苗三千到三千五百株。二、棉田普遍锄九遍，除清田间杂草，及时摘心打杈，并改进打杈技术。三、警惕棉蚜虫害的发生（曲耀离互助组现已准备好棉油皂、杀虫菊乳剂、滴滴涕等农药九千斤和喷雾器两架），及时扑灭棉蚜、红蜘蛛等虫害。四、全部棉田分三期增施追肥，共施肥田粉八百五十五斤。丰产地每亩追施肥田粉二十斤。五、灌溉时要适当配合雨量，采用勤浇、轻浇的合理浇水方法，如遇旱时，今年灌溉次数将由去年的七次增到十三次。他们在计划中提出要开展互助组内组员之间的竞赛，并把试验成功的各种植棉技术，及时传播给组外的农民。
