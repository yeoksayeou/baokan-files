    Zheng Fangrong Workshop Improves Operating Methods
    Sets New National Soybean Oil Yield Record

    Editor: The Zheng Fangrong workshop of the Xinmin County Cooperative General Society Oil Mill created a new national record on April 30th, with an oil yield of 14 jin, 3 liang, and 2 qian per 100 jin of second-class soybeans. The main reason for the workshop's high oil yield record was the improvement of operating methods. In the past, when pressing oil, they used two-inch-thick wooden planks, and they had to bend over to tighten the screw, which made it difficult to exert force. Now, they have switched to six-inch-thick wooden planks, and they don't have to bend over to tighten the screw, so they can exert force. They also sun-dry the soybeans the day before roasting them to reduce moisture, making them particularly easy to dry when roasting. They pay close attention to the temperature inside the factory, keeping the room temperature consistently between 35 and 40 degrees, and the roasting temperature consistently between 70 and 80 degrees. This is one of the important conditions for increasing oil yield. In order to exchange experiences, they often hold technical research meetings to improve technology. Now, they have put forward the slogan "Strive for an oil yield of 14 jin 5 liang to 15 jin per 100 jin of soybeans," and have issued a friendly challenge to oil mills throughout Northeast China.

    郑芳荣车间改进操作方法
    创大豆出油率全国新纪录
    编辑同志：新民县合作总社制油厂郑芳荣车间，在四月三十日创造了每百斤二等大豆出油十四斤三两二钱的全国最高纪录。该车间创造高纪录出油率的主要原因是改进了操作方法。他们过去榨油时，使用二寸厚木拍，绞杠子要弯腰，使不上劲。现在，他们改用六寸厚的木拍，绞杠子时不用弯腰，就使上劲了。他们又在炕豆子前一天，把豆子晒好，以减低水分，使炕时特别容易干燥。他们十分注意厂内的温度，屋子温度经常保持三十五度到四十度，炕上温度经常保持七十度到八十度。这是提高出油率的重要条件之一。为了交流经验，他们经常召开技术研究会，以便改进技术。现在，他们提出“争取每百斤豆子出油十四斤五两到十五斤”的口号，向东北各地制油厂提出了友谊挑战。
