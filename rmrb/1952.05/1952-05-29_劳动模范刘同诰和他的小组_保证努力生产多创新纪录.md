    Labor Model Liu Tonggao and His Group
    Guarantee Efforts in Production and More Record-Breaking Innovations
    Editor: Since the "Three-Anti" Movement, our workers have felt relaxed and happy, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. I and everyone else have the same idea: since we are the masters of our own house, we must have the attitude of masters, we must work harder, produce more, and build our country well. To increase production and practice economy, I think about it when I go home, I think about it when I walk, and I study and look for tricks whenever I have time. The workers in our workshop are making production a lively affair. In the pig iron work, because the newly bought coke is not good, the work is slow, and the guaranteed quality cannot be achieved, everyone is very anxious, and they work harder. Worker Niu Fengguang said, "Working is for the country, and being concerned with personal gain is the most useless." Thanks to everyone's efforts, since May, our group has created eight new records, improved tools three times, and also improved the circular work method. We know that the great May was dyed red by the blood of the martyrs, and we can only commemorate it by working hard in production. Therefore, our group guarantees to increase production by 55 tons of grain for the country from April to the end of the year.

    劳动模范刘同诰和他的小组
    保证努力生产多创新纪录
    编辑同志：“三反”运动以来，我们工人的精神轻松愉快，生产热情更高了。我和大家有一样的想法：既当家作主人，就得有主人的态度，就要多干活，多生产，把祖国建设好。为了增产节约，我回家时想，走路时也想，一有空便钻研找窍门。我们车间的工人们，把生产搞得热火朝天。在化铁工作上，因新买的焦炭不好，赶活慢，达不到所保证的质量，大家心里急得慌，都加劲地干。工人牛凤光说：“干活是为了国家，计较个人是最没出息的。”由于大家的努力，五月以来，我组创造了新纪录八次，改进工具三次，还改进了循环工作法。我们知道，伟大的五月是先烈的血染红的，我们只有努力生产来纪念它。因此，我组保证从四月份到年底，给国家增产五十五吨粮食。
