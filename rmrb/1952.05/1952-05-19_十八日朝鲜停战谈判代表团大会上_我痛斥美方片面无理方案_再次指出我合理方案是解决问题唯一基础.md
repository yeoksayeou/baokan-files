Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th – At the eighteenth meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, our chief representative, General Nam Il, strongly condemned the opposing side's absurd argument that their unilateral and unreasonable plan of April 28th was a final plan containing four major concessions. He pointed out that the opposing side's unreasonable demand to detain our captured personnel as cannon fodder, in violation of the natural desire of prisoners of war to return home and live peacefully and the explicit provisions of the Geneva Convention, is the only reason hindering the Korean armistice. General Nam Il's main speech is as follows:

"In the three unresolved issues, your side's April 28th plan only made a non-essential concession on the issue of building airfields, which was entirely your side's tool for bargaining. But yesterday, your side fabricated and said that you had made four major concessions on the three unresolved issues. Not only did you describe your withdrawal of the ridiculous arguments on the issue of prisoners of war that had long been refuted by our side, and your re-submission of the unreasonable demand for so-called re-screening of prisoners of war that had long been firmly opposed by our side, as two major concessions on your part, but you even described the major concession made by our May 2nd plan on the issue of neutral nation nominations as a 'genuine concession' on your part. This kind of self-deceiving statement is originally a mockery of people's common sense, has no place in this meeting, and is not worth refuting. However, your sophistry of inverting right and wrong and fabricating something out of nothing vividly proves how shockingly unfair and unreasonable your April 28th plan is, just as you can never prove to the people of the world that black is white. You will never be qualified to say that your April 28th plan is a fair and reasonable plan, and no sophistry can change this proof. This is an unshakable fact.

Everyone knows that the only thing hindering the realization of the Korean armistice now is the prisoner-of-war issue, and the prisoner-of-war issue should not have become a difficult problem to solve. It is a matter of course that when the war stops, both sides release and repatriate all the prisoners of war they have captured, which is clearly stipulated by the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention. Based on this universally recognized principle, the prisoner-of-war issue should have been resolved quickly and reasonably long ago. The reason why the prisoner-of-war issue cannot be resolved is entirely due to your side's violation of the natural desire of prisoners of war to return home and live peacefully, and the universally recognized provisions of the Geneva Convention, and your insistence on your absurd demand to detain our captured personnel as your cannon fodder.

Since the discussion of the repatriation issue began on December 11, 1951, our side has continuously made significant concessions on the prisoner-of-war issue in order to negotiate a solution to the problem on a reasonable basis. However, your side has not made any relative efforts, but still insists on your unilateral and unreasonable demands, attempting to forcibly detain our captured personnel. In order to achieve your goal of forcibly detaining our captured personnel, for a long time, your side has used the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and Li Seung-man's secret agents to inflict all kinds of inhuman treatment on our captured personnel, and adopted all barbaric methods, not hesitating to create well-known bloody cases, and forcibly screened our captured personnel, making them forever trapped in your slavery. Your lawless and sinful acts have developed to the point that you cannot cover them up no matter what. Your former prisoner-of-war camp commander openly admitted to the inhuman treatment of our captured personnel, and the activities of forcibly screening and rearming prisoners of war. Your current prisoner-of-war camp commander has directly hinted that you will continue to inflict inhuman treatment on our captured personnel and continue to forcibly screen them to be your cannon fodder. Your actions completely violate the Geneva Convention and are intolerable to the conscience of mankind. However, your commander-in-chief actually claimed that your treatment of our captured personnel is completely in accordance with the Geneva Convention, which is a complete violation of the facts. You should know that your demand to forcibly detain our captured personnel in the name of 'voluntary repatriation' is a fundamental violation of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention. Your unilateral and unreasonable demand is absolutely unacceptable. Regardless of the urgent desire of your captured personnel to return home and live peacefully, your side would rather the Korean War not stop than insist on your demand to detain our captured personnel. As long as you continue to insist on this demand for one more day, you will not be able to convince the people of the world that you have the sincerity to reach a truce agreement. As long as you continue to indicate that your plan is final for one more day, you are equal to announcing to the people of the world that you do not hope to seek a truce in Korea. By adopting such a brutal and arbitrary attitude and insisting on such a unilateral and unreasonable plan, you are not qualified to talk about the sincerity of the truce. In order to negotiate a solution to the problem on a reasonable basis and to realize the Korean armistice as soon as possible, our side has rejected your April 28th plan and put forward our May 2nd reasonable compromise plan. This is the only reasonable basis for solving the problem. The next step of the negotiation is entirely up to your side."

    十八日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上
    我痛斥美方片面无理方案
    再次指出我合理方案是解决问题唯一基础
    【新华社开城十八日电】十八日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军痛斥对方自称其四月二十八日片面无理的方案，为包含四大让步的最后方案的荒谬论点，指出对方违反战俘回家过和平生活的天然愿望和日内瓦公约的明确规定，企图扣留我被俘人员充当炮灰的无理主张，是阻碍着朝鲜停战的唯一原因。南日将军主要发言如下：
    “在三个未决问题上，你方四月二十八日的方案只是在修建机场这一个完全是你方拿来作讨价还价的工具的问题上，作了并非实质的让步。但你方昨天却无中生有地说，你方在三个未决问题上，作了四个重大让步。你方不仅把你方在战俘问题上对早被我方驳倒的无聊论点的撤销，和你方再次提出而早为我方所坚决反对的所谓对战俘的再甄别的无理要求，说成是你方的两个重大让步，而且竟然把我方五月二日方案对中立国提名问题所作的重大让步，也说成是你方的‘真正的让步’。你方这种自欺欺人的说法，本来是对于人们的常识的嘲讽，在这个会议中没有它的地位，值不得一驳。但你们这种颠倒是非无中生有的诡辩，却生动地证明你方四月二十八日方案是如何骇人听闻地不公平和不合理，正如同你方永远不能向世界人民证明黑的就是白的一样。你方永远没有资格说你们的四月二十八日方案是一个公平并合理的方案，任何诡辩都不能改变这个证明的。这是不可动摇的事实。
    谁都知道现在阻碍着朝鲜停战的实现的是只有一个战俘问题，而战俘问题本来是不应该成为难予解决的问题的。战争停止了，双方释放并遣返其所收容的全部战俘，是天经地义的事，是日内瓦战俘公约所明确规定的。本着这个举世公认的原则，战俘问题早就应该得到迅速而合理的解决。战俘问题之所以不能解决，完全是由于你方违反战俘回家过和平生活的天然愿望，和日内瓦公约的举世公认的规定，坚持你方扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰的荒谬主张。
    自从一九五一年十二月十一日开始讨论遣俘问题以来，为了在合理基础上协商解决问题，我方连续在战俘问题上作了重大的让步。但你方没有作任何相对的努力，却仍然坚持你方片面无理的主张，企图强迫扣留我方被俘人员。为了实现你方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的目的，长时期以来，你方就利用蒋介石匪帮和使用李承晚特务，对我方被俘人员施行各种非人道的待遇，采取一切野蛮办法，不惜酿成举世周知的血案，并强迫甄别我方被俘人员，使他们永远陷于你方的奴役。你们这种无法无天的罪恶行为，已经发展到你们怎样也掩盖不了的程度。你方前任战俘营长官公开承认对我方被俘人员的非人道的待遇，和强行甄别与重新武装战俘的活动。你方现任战俘营长官又直接暗示，你方将继续对我方被俘人员的非人道的待遇，继续强迫甄别他们充当你方的炮灰。你方这种行为彻底破坏了日内瓦公约，并为人类的良心所不容许。但你方总司令却竟然声称，你方对我方被俘人员的待遇，是完全符合于日内瓦公约的，这是彻底违反事实的。你方应该知道你方以‘自愿遣返’的名义，强迫扣留我方被俘人员的主张，就是根本违反日内瓦战俘公约的。你方这种片面无理的主张，是绝对不能接受的。你方不顾你方被俘人员要求回家过和平生活的迫切愿望，你方宁可使朝鲜战争停不下来，而坚持你方扣留我方被俘人员的主张。你方只要有一天还坚持这个主张，你们就不能使世界人民相信你们是有达成停战协议的诚意的。你方只要有一天继续表示你方方案是最后的，你方就是等于向全世界人民宣告你方并不希望求得朝鲜的停战。你方采取如此横蛮独断的态度，坚持如此片面无理的方案，你方就没有任何资格来谈停战的诚意的。为了在合理基础上协商解决问题，为了早日实现朝鲜停战，我方已经拒绝了你方提出的四月二十八日的方案，并提出了我方五月二日的合理折衷方案。这是解决问题的唯一合理基础。谈判的下一步完全在于你方。”
