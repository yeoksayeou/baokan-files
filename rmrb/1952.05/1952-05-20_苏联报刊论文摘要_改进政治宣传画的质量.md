An abridged version of an editorial from the Soviet newspaper Pravda on April 25th, entitled "On How to Improve the Quality of Political Propaganda Posters," is published below:

The artistic propaganda posters published by various publishing houses in our country, in terms of their subject matter, have not reflected the most important events in Soviet domestic and international life, and their response to these events has been very slow. The themes of the posters are often narrow, limited, and monotonous. They do not show a truly valuable reflection of the achievements of our national economy, Soviet culture, and the development of the labor and life of the working class and collective farm peasants in the post-war period. The posters do not adequately publicize the experience of advanced workers in industry and agriculture, and there are no posters that express the superiority of the expanded collective farm economy.

The struggle of the Soviet people for lasting peace and the security of all nations against the warmongers is not adequately reflected in the posters. For some unknown reason, satirical propaganda posters, which are of great interest to the Soviet people, have almost completely ceased to be published.

Satirical propaganda posters are the sharpest weapon in the struggle against corrupt bourgeois ideology and the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors.

Some propaganda poster artists know very little about life, and they do not study how Soviet people live and work, which has had a detrimental effect on the quality of the posters. Many propaganda poster artists rarely go to factories, construction sites, and collective farms. They do not study socialist reality, and therefore do not understand the specific working and living environment of the Soviet people, and do not see the growth of new things in our life. The content of the propaganda posters created by such artists is naturally poor and dull.

Recently, many propaganda posters have lost the unique method of artistic expression inherent in propaganda posters. The propaganda poster has become a poor reproduction of a sketch, which greatly weakens its impact on the audience.

Unlike sketches, propaganda posters make direct appeals to the audience with words. The organic unity of words and pictures is the most important condition for improving the effectiveness of propaganda posters. The best examples of propaganda posters are often made jointly by artists and writers. Previously, the explanations on propaganda posters were written specifically by writers. Recently, because writers no longer participate in the creation of propaganda posters, the words on most propaganda posters are largely divorced from the pictures.

In the creation of propaganda posters, the best poets, writers, and masters of language must be absorbed. They can give great help to propaganda posters in developing the best traditions of Mayakovsky and Bedny.

Artistic political propaganda posters are a true form of high art, which requires profound content and an easy-to-understand, perfect form. Propaganda posters must never be treated as second-rate goods, or be handled by artisans.

The authors of propaganda posters often do not pay attention to the richness of the spiritual life of the Soviet people, do not explore the depth of their thoughts and feelings, their high level of consciousness and culture, so the painters depict the characters as indistinguishable and monotonous.

The occurrence of serious shortcomings in the publication of artistic political propaganda posters also illustrates that the Soviet Artists Association, the All-Union Academy of Arts, and the central and local newspapers have very little criticism of the products of propaganda posters and the creation of individual propaganda poster artists.

To do everything possible to develop creativity, improve skills, and enable painters to make in-depth studies of life are the conditions required for creating high-quality propaganda posters.

The distribution of propaganda posters is an important political undertaking. We must constantly and persistently strive for a high level of ideological and artistic quality in propaganda posters. Local Party organizations should establish strict supervision to supervise the ideological content and artistic level of the propaganda posters produced by local publishing houses, and they should also ensure the correct distribution and utilization of all propaganda poster products.

### 苏联报刊论文摘要  改进政治宣传画的质量

专栏：

    改进政治宣传画的质量
    苏联真理报四月二十五日刊载了该报编辑部所发表
    的论如何改进政治宣传画质量的论文，摘要如下：
    我国各个出版社所刊行的艺术宣传画，就它们的主题说，还没有能反映出苏联国内和国际生活中最重要的事件，它们对这些事件的反应还非常迟缓。宣传画的主题常是狭隘、局限而且千篇一律。其中看不到我国国民经济、苏维埃文化以及工人阶级与集体农场农民的劳动和生活在战后时期发展的成绩的真正有价值的反映。宣传画对工农业中的先进人员的经验宣传得不够，而表示扩大后的集体农场经济的优越性的宣传画则还没有。
    对于苏联人民为争取持久和平与各民族安全以反对战争贩子的斗争，在宣传画中反映得十分不够。由于某种不可知的原因，苏联人所最感兴趣的讽刺宣传画，几乎已完全停止发行。
    讽刺宣传画是与腐化的资产阶级思想，与帝国主义侵略者的阴谋进行斗争的最尖锐的武器。
    一些宣传画的画家对生活懂得很少，他们不研究苏联人是怎样在劳动和生活，这对于宣传画的质量就发生了恶劣的影响。很多宣传画的画家极少到企业、建筑场地和集体农场中去，他们不研究社会主义的现实，因而也就不了解苏联人的具体的劳动和生活环境，看不到我国生活中的新事物的增长。由这样的画家所创作的宣传画，其内容自然也是贫乏和枯燥无味的。
    最近以来，很多的宣传画丧失了为宣传画所固有的那种艺术表现的独特方法。宣传画变成了写生画的恶劣翻版，这使它对观众的影响大为减弱。
    宣传画和写生画不同，它以文字向观众作直接的号召。文字和绘画的有机的统一是提高宣传画效能的一个最重要的条件。宣传画的最好范本经常是由画家和作家合制而成的。以前，宣传画上的说明是作家专门写的，最近由于作家不再参加宣传画的创作，一般宣传画上的文字大多已与画面脱节。
    在创作宣传画方面，必须吸收最好的诗人、作家和文字巨匠参加。他们在发展马雅科夫斯基和别德内依所具有的最好传统方面，能够给宣传画以极大的帮助。
    艺术性的政治宣传画是一种真正的高度艺术，它需要有深刻的内容和容易了解的、完美的形式。决不可用对待次等货色的态度来看待宣传画，或是把它交给画匠来包办。
    宣传画的作者们常常不注意苏联人精神生活的丰富，不发掘他们的思想和感觉的深度，他们的高度意识和文化，这样画家们就把人物描绘成毫无特色的千篇一律的样子。
    艺术性政治宣传画出版事业中严重缺点的发生，也说明了苏联画家协会、全苏艺术学院、中央和地方报刊的对宣传画的产品和个别宣传画画家的创作极少批评。
    尽一切力量发展创造性、提高技巧、使画家对生活作深刻的研究，这就是创作高度质量的宣传画所要求的条件。
    宣传画的发行是一个重要的政治事业。我们必须经常地和坚毅地争取宣传画的高度思想艺术水平。各地方的党组织应当建立严格的监督制，监督地方出版社所出的宣传画的思想内容和艺术水平，此外它们并应保证对所有的宣传画出品予以正确的分配和利用。
