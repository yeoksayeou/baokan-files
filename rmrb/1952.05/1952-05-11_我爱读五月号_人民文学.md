Reader's Letter

    I Love Reading the May Issue of "People's Literature"
    Comrade Editor: After reading the May 1952 issue of "People's Literature," I was extremely excited. Inside, there are the resounding, fighting songs of our most beloved people—including the "Volunteer Army Poetry Collection" of ten poems; novels, reports, and four poems created by our country's leading class—our worker brothers; comments from the broad readership—soldiers, government workers, and students—on the literary works "Red Flowers in Full Bloom"; and book reviews from readers. Inside, except for a few translated works, almost all are works by the worker-peasant-soldier masses. I happily read them again and again, feeling the infinite power of these works. "People's Literature" has increasingly accommodated the works of the worker-peasant-soldier masses, and this issue (May) is particularly outstanding in terms of quality and quantity. This is such a gratifying thing! This shows that the integration of people's literature with the worker-peasant-soldier masses is becoming closer. As far as the "People's Literature" publication itself is concerned, this is only a beginning, but it is a good beginning!
    We sincerely hope that the "People's Literature" editorial department will forever continue and carry forward this excellent style of combining with the worker-peasant-soldier masses.

    我爱读五月号“人民文学”
    编辑同志：读了一九五二年五月号“人民文学”以后，我兴奋极了。这里面，有我们最可爱的人的嘹亮的、战斗的歌声——包括十首诗的“志愿军诗辑”；有我们祖国的领导阶级——工人兄弟创作的小说、报告及四首诗篇；有来自广大读者群——部队、机关、学校的读者对文学作品“红花朵朵开”的评论；还有来自读者的书评。这里面，除了几篇译作而外，几乎全是工农兵群众的作品。我愉快地一次又一次地读着它们，感到这些作品有无穷的力量。“人民文学”已经越来越多地容纳工农兵群众的作品了，尤以这一期（五月号）质精量多，最为特出。这是多么可喜的事啊！这说明人民文学事业和工农兵群众的结合是更加紧密了。就“人民文学”刊物本身来说，这还只是一个开始，然而这是一个好的开始！
    我们竭诚希望“人民文学”编辑部永远继续并发扬这一优良的、与工农兵大众结合的作风。
