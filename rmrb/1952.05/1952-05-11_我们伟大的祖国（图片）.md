Our great motherland
The completion of the Yellow River irrigation project to benefit Ji and Wei not only fundamentally solved the Yellow River's flood problem and irrigated farmland, but also regulated the water volume of the Wei River, enabling wooden boats of more than 100 tons and steamships of 200 tons to navigate.

They are fully loaded with local and special products and are being transported to Tianjin.
