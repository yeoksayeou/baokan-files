    “Five-Anti” Briefs
    ▲ The "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai has entered the processing phase, and the settlement of cases for over 10,000 large industrial and commercial households in the city has begun in batches and meticulously. Since the third phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai, the Municipal Production Increase and Savings Committee has been classifying and processing the small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households, which account for a large proportion of the city's industrial and commercial households. As of May 10th, more than 99,000 small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households in various districts of the city had been reviewed and finalized by local workers and the District Production Increase and Savings Committee, and notifications were issued. After the fourth phase of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai began, all "Five-Anti" work cadres in various districts, except for a portion who continued to lead mutual assistance and mutual evaluation work, transitioned to processing work, and began to handle the problems of more than 10,000 large industrial and commercial households. Currently, the city has organized more than 2,000 cadres with a certain level of political understanding, who can grasp policies, are familiar with industry conditions, and understand accounting business, to specialize in processing work. On May 11th, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee held its tenth meeting to discuss the processing work of the "Five-Anti" movement. Mayor Chen Yi pointed out at the meeting that the processing work of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai should be carried out gradually, meticulously, and carefully in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, adopting the principle of "no delay in restitution and production"; however, for the small number of major thieves whose crimes are serious and who cannot be dealt with to appease public anger, or who attempt to use the people's leniency to conspire to sabotage, they will be resolutely and severely punished.
    ▲ The Guangzhou Municipal Savings Inspection Committee's "Five-Anti" Movement Committee recently leniently treated another group of seriously illegal and completely illegal industrial and commercial households who were still able to confess honestly. Those who received lenient treatment included 43 households from the first phase of the Guangzhou "Five-Anti" movement and 72 households inspected in the second phase. The capitalists' "five poisons" crimes of these illegal industrial and commercial households were very serious. Several of the illegal households in the first phase's New Drug Industry were organizers of collective smuggling. According to their confessions, the amount of smuggled goods exceeded 100 billion, and some pharmacies sold 80% of their medicines as smuggled goods. The illegal gains of the 72 households inspected in the second phase exceeded 100 billion, not including bribery, smuggling, and foreign exchange speculation. However, with the help of workers and "Five-Anti" staff, under the influence of the People's Government's policies, and with the persuasion of colleagues and family members, they were finally able to honestly confess their problems. Therefore, the Municipal "Five-Anti" Movement Committee announced that they would all be given lenient treatment.
    ▲ The "Five-Anti" movement in Nanjing has achieved a basic victory. Private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods are actively engaged in production and improving their operations. Over the past three months, after mobilization for confession, accusation, and inspection, 99% of the city's industrial and commercial households have confessed their problems. The People's Government, based on the principle of "leniency in the past, strictness in the future," gave lenient treatment according to different situations and provided support to industrial households that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods. Since May, the iron and steel machinery industry has undertaken national processing orders accounting for more than one-half of the industry's total production capacity.

    “五反”简讯
    ▲上海市“五反”运动已进入处理阶段，目前已开始分批地、细致地处理全市一万多大工商户的结案问题。从上海市“五反”运动第三期起，市增产节约委员会对占全市工商户比重极大的中小工商户即进行了分类处理。到五月十日止，全市各区共有九万九千多户中小工商户经当地职工和区增产节约委员会审查定案，并发给了通知书。上海市“五反”运动第四期开始后，各区的“五反”工作干部除一部分继续领导进行互助互评工作外，全部转入处理工作，着手处理一万多大工商户的问题。现在全市已组织了二千多个有一定的政治水平，能够掌握政策，熟悉行业情况和懂得会计业务的干部，专门进行处理工作。五月十一日，上海市人民政府委员会举行第十次会议时讨论了“五反”运动的处理工作。市长陈毅在会上指出：上海市“五反”运动的处理工作应当按照毛主席的指示，逐步地、细致地、缜密地进行，采取“退补、生产”两不误的方针；但对于少数罪行严重，不办不足以平民愤的大盗窃犯，或企图利用人民的宽大处理阴谋破坏者，将坚决地严厉地予以惩办。
    ▲广州市节约检查委员会“五反”运动委员会最近又宽大处理了一批尚能坦白的严重违法和完全违法的工商户。受到宽大处理的有广州市“五反”运动第一期的四十三家和第二期被检查的七十二家。这些违法工商户的资本家的“五毒”罪行都很严重。第一期的新药业违法户中有多家是集体走私的组织者，据他们坦白走私货额在一千亿以上，有些药店出卖的药品百分之八十都是私货。第二期的七十二家被检查户，违法所得在一千亿元以上，行贿、走私、套汇等还未算在内。但是他们在工人店员和“五反”工作人员的帮助下，在人民政府政策的感召下，在同业和家属的规劝下，最后都能坦白交代了问题。因此，市“五反”运动委员会宣布一律给他们以宽大处理。
    ▲南京市“五反”运动已取得基本胜利。有利于国计民生的私营工商业，正积极进行生产和改善经营。三个月来，经过动员坦白、检举、检查，全市已有百分之九十九的工商户交代了问题。人民政府根据“过去从宽、今后从严”的原则，分别情况予以宽大处理，并对有益国计民生的工业户予以扶持。钢铁机器业五月以来，承接国家加工定货占该业总生产力的二分之一以上。
