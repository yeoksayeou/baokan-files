    Workers of the Jiang'an Supply Cooperative of the Hankou Railway Sub-bureau
    Selflessly Rescue National Materials
    Editor: The workers of the Jiang'an Supply Cooperative of the Hankou Railway Sub-bureau are rescuing national materials with selfless spirit. One night at twelve o'clock, a strong wind and heavy rain suddenly arose, overturning the tarpaulins of the freight cars. The freight cars were loaded with a large number of rolls of paper from the Hankou China Department Store. When workers Yi Yourong and Yin Xiangyun heard the sound of the tarpaulins, they bravely went to cover the tarpaulins, preserving four hundred million yuan of national property. On another occasion, the Northeast Trade Department transported eighteen tons of calcium carbide. That night, it rained heavily. Knowing that calcium carbide would generate heat and become ineffective upon contact with water, the workers immediately took action and actively rescued the batch of calcium carbide. Some workers were injured during the rescue. The Southwest Equipment Company placed three hundred and twenty tons of steel bars in Jiang'an. On May 6, the water level in the Yangtze River rose sharply. Due to the shortage of ships, it was impossible to transport them in time, and the steel bars were submerged to a depth of twelve feet. Worker Jiang Wanyou took the lead, and workers from the Seventeenth Team voluntarily requested to go into the water to salvage the steel; after two days of salvage, they successfully completed the task.

    汉口铁路分局江岸供应社工人
    忘我地抢救国家物资
    编辑同志：汉口铁路分局江岸供应社工人，以忘我精神抢救国家物资。有一天晚上十二点钟，大风大雨陡起，把货车的篷布都掀翻了。货车里装的是汉口中国百货公司的大批卷筒纸。工人易幼荣、印祥云听见篷布响声，奋不顾身地前往抢盖篷布，保全了四亿元的国家财产。另一次，东北贸易部运到十八吨电石。这天晚上下大雨。工人们知道电石见水就发热失效，马上行动起来，积极地抢救出了这批电石。有些工人因抢救而负了伤。西南器材公司在江岸放了三百二十吨钢筋，五月六日，江中水势大涨，因船只太少，无法及时抢运，钢筋被淹没达一丈二尺深。工人江万友带头，和十七队工人自动要求下水打捞；打捞了两天，胜利地完成了任务。  孙培根
