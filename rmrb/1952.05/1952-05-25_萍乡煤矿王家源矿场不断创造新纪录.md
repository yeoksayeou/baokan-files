Pingxiang Coal Mine's Wangjiayuan Mine Continues to Set New Records
Zhao Tianyuan

Pingxiang Coal Mine's Wangjiayuan Mine, in the "Three-Anti" struggle, overfulfilled its first quarter production plan (including increased production and savings targets) by 26.47 percent. The plan for the first half of April was also overfulfilled by 43 percent. In the first quarter, Wangjiayuan Mine created a total of 42 new records (several of which were national records), increasing production and saving the country over 2.14 billion yuan in wealth. In April, under the slogan of "Catch all the 'tigers', create new records, and welcome the 'May Day' International Labor Day," all employees created many new records. All the mine's employees are inspired by these glorious achievements.

Close combination of leadership and the masses is an important reason for Wangjiayuan Mine's continuous progress. Zhang Shunan, the director of Wangjiayuan Mine, once talked about such a thing: in December of last year, just as Chairman Mao called for increased production and savings, the No. 1 well had no working face and there was a risk of shutdown. At that time, everyone's opinions were divided. The leading cadres of Wangjiayuan Mine resolutely relied on the working masses, adopted the engineer's opinions, and persuaded the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau and the middle-level cadres of the mine to obtain their agreement and support, opening up the fully closed recovery area of ​​the No. 1 well's fourth lower mountain
(This area was mined by the people using indigenous methods a long time ago, so there is still a lot of coal that has not been mined), opening up a source of coal, extending the life of the pit mouth by half a year, and increasing the country's production by 20,000 tons of coal. In the "Three-Anti" movement, the leading cadres of the mine made a relatively profound self-criticism to the masses, expressing that they would humbly accept the opinions of the masses in the future. When leading cadres truly rely on the masses, the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses will be greatly brought into play. They said: "Leading cadres can accept the opinions of the masses. In the future, if we come up with rationalization proposals, as long as they are beneficial to the work, we will no longer say 'too lazy to talk about it, it's useless to talk about it'!"

After the leading cadres established the idea of relying on the masses to do a good job in production, from February onwards, the monthly production plans were handed over to the workers for discussion, and the production quotas were also handed over to the workers to control. After doing this, the leading cadres saw the power of the masses and further realized the importance of relying on the masses. Once, when discussing the plan, Ma Yuquan of the fifth group of the No. 1 well said: "As long as the leadership can help solve the problems, we can guarantee the completion of the task." After Deputy Mine Director Zhang Tianbao learned about this, he immediately summoned the workers of the fifth group to a meeting to ask about their difficulties. The workers raised issues such as the small roadways, uneven floor, difficulty in transporting coal, unreasonable labor organization, and serious absenteeism. After research, the leadership sent people to repair the roadways the next day and agreed to the workers' own proposed adjustments to the labor organization. In this way, the completion of the task was guaranteed. After the workers mastered the production quotas, they kept in mind the unit price of materials at all times and were unwilling to waste even a little. They knew that every bit was the wealth of the country and the sweat of their own labor. No one in the mine took good timber to split into pieces. Occasionally, if a worker made a mistake, he would immediately be severely criticized by the masses. Workers on the surface also tried to get all the wood out of the stone ballast piles. In the past, this was considered impossible. Due to the workers' conscious saving, the consumption quotas of pit props and other materials have been reduced successively. In the first quarter alone, 400 million yuan was saved in five major materials: pit props, timber, explosives, detonators, and grease. The actual cost in the first quarter was 23.18 percent lower than the planned cost.

The strengthening of the workers' sense of being masters of their own affairs is also reflected in the workers' solidarity and their relationship to production. The mine strengthened democratic unity in the democratic reform, and the problem of local factions among the workers was resolved. But the workers did not really understand what solidarity meant. Therefore, the phenomenon of no one "affecting" anyone and "everyone doing their own thing" was still very common in production. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the workers of the eighth group of the fourth branch, in order to get more wages for themselves, only cared about the speed of progress, so that the roadways did not meet the specifications and a lot of materials were wasted; because they were afraid that others would "take advantage," the three shifts of workers calculated the progress separately, and there was no contact between shifts, and the upper shift did not care about the lower shift; at the same time, the labor organization was unreasonable, and the phenomenon of absenteeism was serious. In the "Three-Anti," the workers of the eighth group consciously checked the waste. In order to do a good job in production, they first voluntarily proposed to adjust the labor organization: the three shifts calculated the progress together, the number of people was reduced from thirty to twenty-two, each person had a specific division of labor, and they could help each other when work required it. They also automatically entered into plans and competitions between shifts. When engineering was found to be substandard or violated security regulations, criticism and self-criticism was carried out. The workers of the eighth group understood what is called "unity," and they changed from a backward group to an advanced group. In the past, their group of thirty people averaged eight meters of tunneling per day, but now twenty-two people average ten meters of tunneling per day, and also created two national records of 21 meters and 37 meters (partially coal seam) for rock tunnel tunneling. In addition, they also save an average of seven explosives and four detonators per day. With the improvement of production, the workers' wages have also increased by one-third. This kind of progress is not only reflected in the eighth group. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, some workers, in order to get more wages, often argued with the personnel who calculated the progress over every inch of progress or when distinguishing sandstone and shale, and even argued in the trade union office. After the "Three-Anti," the workers understood that this kind of behavior of haggling over personal interests was not the true nature of the working class, and not only did the phenomenon of quarreling disappear, but they also consciously and strictly supervised these staff members, not allowing them to be careless. Because the workers knew that carelessness was irresponsible to production, to the country, and to the cause of liberation of the working class.

When representatives of the returning volunteers and the delegation of the Korean people to China visited the mine, the slogan "Create new records to welcome the most beloved people and the closest comrades-in-arms" quickly became the driving force for all the mine's workers. The workers racked their brains, and new records appeared one after another. Ma Yuquan in the Yang Hui group pondered for a night, absorbed the spirit of Guo Qing's "intermediate slotting retreat mining method," and created the "double slotting retreat mining method," creating a new national record of 112 tons of coal mined by hand pickaxe in eight hours. Subsequently, Yu Musheng created a new national record of 154 tons of coal mined by hand pickaxe in eight hours, and Qu Lulian created a new national record of 173 tons of coal mined by hand pickaxe in eight hours, which was 34 tons more than the new record for wind pickaxe mining in Pingxiang Coal Mine. The Stone Gate Iron and Steel Team also continuously summarized experience, improved technology and working conditions, and created a new national record of 24.7 meters of rock alley tunneling in one day and night in March, exceeding the quota by five and a half times. In April, they also created three new national records for rock alley tunneling in a row. These were all created by using multi-channel circulating tunneling method in medium-hard and medium-hard and below rock formations. When they created the first new national record last November, they used short wind drills of less than two meters, so they needed to pull a groove again after pulling a groove once. On April 15 this year, they changed to using a three-meter-long wind drill, which can be pulled to 2.5 meters at a time, thus reducing the time for drilling holes, installing explosives, and blasting, and tunneled 25.1 meters in one day and night. After creating this new record, they immediately summed it up. They felt that they were not yet proficient in using long wind drills, and the ventilation was poor. After blasting, the smoke and rock ash did not dissipate for a long time, and they had to wait outside for fifteen to twenty minutes before they could enter the working face to continue working. Therefore, everyone decided that in addition to accelerating the improvement of the proficiency in using long wind drills, they would also adopt a temporary method of watering before blasting to reduce rock ash. Then they created a new record of 27.85 meters of tunneling on April 21. Then, they summarized again. In the summary, they pointed out that the smoke could not dissipate quickly, and time was still wasted. After the mine leaders learned about this situation, they decided to temporarily install an electric fan near the working face before the ventilation was improved. In this way, because the smoke dissipated quickly, the workers of the Stone Gate Iron and Steel Team created a new record of 30.5 meters of tunneling on April 30. More and more groups are creating new records. In the three days from April 9 to 11, the workers created nine new records in a row. Now, many new records that exceed the quota by one to two times have already been made. Sometimes, workers are even unwilling to report them, thinking that this is "not a new record!" Now, Wangjiayuan Mine is preparing to formulate a new production increase and savings plan as a goal for further efforts.

    萍乡煤矿王家源矿场不断创造新纪录
    赵天元
    萍乡煤矿王家源矿场，在“三反”斗争中，超额百分之二十六点四七，完成了第一季生产计划（包括增产节约任务）。四月上半月的计划也超额百分之四十三完成了。在第一季中，王家源矿场共创造了四十二项新纪录（其中有几项是全国新纪录），为国家增产节约了二十一亿四千多万元的财富。四月份，全体职工在“捉尽‘老虎’，再创新纪录，迎接‘五一’国际劳动节”的口号下，又创造了多项新纪录。全矿职工都为这些光辉的成就而振奋。
    领导和群众密切结合，是王家源矿不断前进的重要原因。王家源矿矿长张树楠曾经谈过这样一件事情：去年十二月份，正当毛主席号召增产节约以后，一号井没有掌子面了，有停采的危险。当时，大家的意见是纷歧的。王家源矿的领导干部坚决依靠工人群众，采纳工程师的意见，说服了矿务局领导干部和矿场的中级干部，取得他们的同意和支持，打开了一号井四下山已经完全封闭的回采区
    （这个区在很早以前是由老百姓用土法开采的，所以还有很多煤没有采出来），开辟了煤源，延长坑口寿命半年，为国家增产了二万吨煤。在“三反”运动中，该矿场领导干部向群众作了比较深刻的检讨，表示今后要虚心接受群众的意见。领导干部真正依靠了群众，群众的智慧和积极性就大大地发挥出来。他们说：“领导干部能接受群众意见了。以后想出了合理化建议，只要对工作有好处，我们再也不说‘懒得谈，谈了也没有用’了！”
    领导干部树立了依靠群众搞好生产的思想以后，从二月份起，每月生产计划都交给工人讨论，生产定额也交给工人掌握。这样做了以后，领导干部看到了群众的力量，更进一步地体会到依靠群众的重要。有一次讨论计划时，一号井五组马雨全说：“只要领导方面能帮助解决问题，我们就能保证完成任务。”副矿长张天保知道后，马上召集第五组工人开会，询问大家的困难。工人把巷道小、底板不平、运煤困难和劳动组织不合理、窝工现象严重等问题都提了出来。经过研究，第二天领导方面就派人修好巷道，并同意了工人自己提出的调整劳动组织的意见。这样，完成任务就有了保证。工人们掌握了生产定额后，时时刻刻牢记材料单价，一点也不肯浪费。他们知道，一点一滴都是国家的财富，都是自己的血汗。井下没有一个人拿好木材劈片。偶然有工人做错了，立刻就会受到群众的严格批评。井上工人也想办法把石碴堆里的木头全部取出来。在过去，这是被认为不可能的事。由于工人自觉地节约，坑木等材料损耗定额相继减低。仅在坑木、木材、炸药、雷管、油脂等五项主要材料方面，第一季就节约了四亿元。第一季实际成本比计划成本降低了百分之二十三点一八。
    工人们当家作主观念的加强，还表现在工人的团结和对生产的关系上。矿场在民主改革中加强了民主团结，工人中地方派系的问题解决了。但是怎样才叫做团结，工人们还没有真正的认识。因此，在生产中谁也不“影响”谁、“各搞各”的现象仍然非常普遍。“三反”运动前，四分井第八组的工人，为了自己多得工资，只顾进度快，以致巷道不合规格、材料浪费很多；因为怕别人“沾光”，三班工人分开计算进度，班和班之间互不联系，上班不管下班；同时，劳动组织不合理，窝工现象严重。在“三反”中，第八组的工人自觉地检查了浪费。为了搞好生产，他们首先自动提出调整劳动组织：三班合在一起计算进度，人数由三十人减到二十二人，每人都有具体分工，工作需要时也能互相帮助。他们还自动地在班和班之间订计划展开竞赛。发现工程不合规格、违反保安制度的，就展开批评和自我批评。第八组的工人懂得了什么叫做“团结”，他们由落后组变成了先进组。以前他们组三十个人平均每天掘进八公尺，现在二十二人平均每天掘进十公尺，还创造了石门掘进二十一公尺和三十七公尺（部分煤层）的两项全国新纪录。另外，他们每天还平均节省七个炸药、四个雷管。生产提高了，工人们的工资也增加了三分之一。这种进步并不只表现在八组这一个小组。“三反”运动前，有些工人为了多得工资，常常为了多争一公寸的进度或辨别沙岩、页岩时，和计算进度的人员吵吵闹闹，甚至争吵到工会办公室里。经过“三反”，工人们懂得了这种斤斤计较个人利益的行为不是工人阶级的本色，不仅争吵的现象没有了，而且自觉地严格监督这些工作人员，不许他们马虎一点。因为工人们知道：马虎就是对生产、对国家、对工人阶级的解放事业不负责任。
    当志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民访华代表到矿访问时，“创造新纪录，迎接最可爱的人和最亲密的战友”的口号，迅速地成为全矿工人的动力。工人们开动了脑筋，新纪录接二连三地出现了。杨辉小组中的马雨全苦思一夜，吸取郭清四的“中间抽槽回采法”的精神，创造了“双槽回采法”，创造了八小时手镐采煤一百一十二吨的全国新纪录。接着，喻木生又创造了八小时手镐采煤一百五十四吨的全国新纪录，瞿禄连创八小时手镐采煤一百七十三吨的全国新纪录，比萍乡煤矿风镐采煤的新纪录还多了三十四吨。石门钢铁队也不断总结经验，改进技术和工作条件，三月间创一昼夜石巷掘进二十四点七公尺的全国新纪录，超过定额五倍半。在四月份又连创三次石巷掘进的全国新纪录。这都是在中硬和中硬以下岩层中，采用多孔道循环掘进法创造的。去年十一月创第一次全国新纪录时，他们使用的是两公尺以下的短风钻，所以拉一次槽口以后还需要再拉一次。今年四月十五日他们改用三公尺长的长风钻，一次就可拉到二点五公尺，因而减少了一次打槽眼、装炸药和放炮的时间，一昼夜掘进二十五点一公尺。在创造这次新纪录后，他们立即进行总结。他们感到使用长风钻还不熟练，并且通风不良，放过炮后，炮烟和岩灰好久不散，要在外面等待十五分钟到二十分钟，才能进入工作面继续工作。于是大家决定除加速提高使用长风钻的熟练程度外，并采用在放炮前泼水以减少岩灰的临时办法。接着他们在四月二十一日创造了掘进二十七点八五公尺的新纪录。接着，他们又进行总结。在总结中，他们指出炮烟未能很快消散，时间仍有浪费。矿场领导方面了解这个情况后，决定在通风情况未改善前，临时在工作面附近装置一部电风扇。这样，由于炮烟很快消散，石门钢铁队工人就又在四月三十日创造了掘进三十点五公尺的新纪录。各组创造新纪录的事越来越多，从四月九日到十一日的三天中，工人们就连创了九项新纪录。现在，一般超过定额一倍到二倍的新纪录，已经是很多了，有时，工人甚至不愿意报告，认为这“不算什么新纪录！”现在，王家源矿正在准备制订新的增产节约计划，作为进一步努力的目标。
