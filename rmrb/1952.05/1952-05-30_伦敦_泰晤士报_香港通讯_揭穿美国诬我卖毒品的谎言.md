Xinhua News Agency, 29th. A Hong Kong dispatch in the London "Times" on May 8th pointed out that the report made by the US government representative to the United Nations Narcotics Commission on May 5th, which slandered our government for selling heroin privately in Japan, was a completely shameless fabrication. The dispatch stated: "There is considerable surprise here (referring to Hong Kong) at the reference in the report given to the United Nations this week by Mr. Anslinger, United States Federal Narcotics Commissioner, to the routing of narcotic drugs through Hong Kong." The dispatch pointed out: For a long time, "there has been no evidence of drug business from mainland China." The dispatch also stated: "The Communists have prohibited the cultivation of opium, and China has never manufactured heroin. The matters mentioned in the report are clearly inconsistent with the current strategy of the Chinese Communists."

    揭穿美国诬我卖毒品的谎言
    【新华社二十九日讯】伦敦“泰晤士报”五月八日刊载的一篇香港通讯，说明了美国政府代表五月五日在联合国麻醉药品委员会中所提出的诬蔑我国政府在日本私卖海洛英的报告完全是无耻的捏造。这篇通讯说：“美国联邦麻醉品专员安斯林格本周给联合国的报告，内中提及麻醉药品的交易路经香港，此间（按指香港）对于此种说法颇为诧异。”这篇通讯指出：许久以来，“没有证据说有来自中国大陆的药品生意”。这篇通讯还说：“共产党已经禁止种植鸦片，同时中国从来没有制造海洛英。该报告所述的事情显然与目前中国共产党的策略是不符的。”
