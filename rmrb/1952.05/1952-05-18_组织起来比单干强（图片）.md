    Getting Organized is Better Than Working Alone

    (13) Wang Quanbao's cotton field also had cotton aphids. However, Wang Quanbao didn't believe in the power of insecticides and couldn't afford a sprayer. He could only mobilize his whole family to use tobacco stem water to treat the cotton aphids, eliminating the pests one seedling at a time. Just two mu of land took two days of effort.
    (14) Li Sixiao's mutual aid group is particular about technology, so their crops are growing particularly well. Their plan to hoe the autumn seedlings three times is about to be completed. Topdressing fertilizer is also being applied to the corn, so a bumper harvest is sure to be within reach.
    (15) But Wang Quanbao was heartbroken. Because he had too few hands and couldn't find short-term labor, not only were five mu of millet west of the river neglected, but three mu of corn land beside the village was also full of weeds. Father and son were worried as soon as they got to the edge of the field. He began to regret leaving the mutual aid group. Poster by Zhang Songhe

    （十四）李四小互助组因为讲究技术，农作物长得特别好。他们秋苗普锄三遍的计划就要完成啦。玉茭也正在上追肥，丰产一定有把握。
    （十五）可是王全保却伤心透啦。因为人手少，顾不过来，短工又找不到，不但荒了河西五亩谷子，村边三亩玉茭地也净是草。父子俩一到地边就发愁。他开始后悔退出互助组了。招贴画张松鹤　作
