    Rural Party Organizations' Propaganda Work Experience in Spring Plowing and Drought Prevention
    Sun Zhongwen, Feng Luren

    In the past two months or so, rural propaganda networks in various regions have launched large-scale propaganda activities in the spring plowing and drought prevention work. Through propaganda, farmers' doubts and concerns about increasing production have been dispelled, and the conservative thinking of the masses of farmers has been criticized, thereby promoting the enthusiasm of farmers for production and enhancing farmers' patriotism. These propaganda activities have provided many useful experiences for using the propaganda network to promote central tasks and strengthen ideological and political work in rural areas. To further promote the patriotic production increase movement, these experiences should be promoted.

    I. The Party's county and district committees must promptly deploy propaganda work according to production tasks.

    While deploying spring plowing and drought prevention work, many county committees promptly convened representative meetings of propagandists. Responsible comrades conveyed this year's agricultural production guidelines and tasks, explained the importance of spring plowing and drought prevention work, criticized the erroneous ideas of "relying on the heavens for food" and "increasing production to the limit," and led them to conduct discussions, exchange past propaganda work experience, and deploy current propaganda tasks. The twelve counties under the Ding County Special District of Hebei Province also convened people's representative meetings and expanded meetings of village cadres, mobilizing more than 50,000 propaganda backbones and activists to participate in propaganda work. Many county and district committees also organized reporters to go to the countryside to report to various propaganda stations and villages and towns, while inspecting production work and guiding the activities of the propaganda network. This has made the connection between the county and district party committees and the propagandists closer. After this series of steps, the propaganda tasks were deployed from the county all the way down to the village.

    Once the spring plowing and drought prevention propaganda tasks were deployed to the village, the village branch mobilized at party and League member meetings and propagandist conferences; at the same time, village cadres, people's representatives, model workers, mutual aid team leaders, militiamen, students in women's literacy classes, teachers of primary and folk schools, reading group leaders, folk artists, etc., were mobilized through other various meetings. Then, with the Party's propagandists as the backbone, active members of the propaganda work were absorbed to form a strong propaganda team, assigned to groups, households, and areas to contract work, and went out together to carry out propaganda activities to the masses of the whole village. Everyone summoned mutual aid team meetings, area meetings, family meetings, field meetings, mass symposiums, etc., to discuss the current drought situation, recall the suffering caused by past famines, exchange experiences in overcoming disasters since liberation, and summarize last year's production increase achievements, to establish the idea of "man will conquer nature" and launch a patriotic production increase upsurge.

    II. It is necessary to target the masses' thinking and use vivid examples for propaganda.

    In drought prevention and spring plowing production, farmers in various regions, on the one hand, demand the development of production, and on the other hand, generally have the negative idea of "relying on the heavens for food" and the conservative idea of "increasing production to the limit." To break through these ideological obstacles of the farmers, we must come up with living facts to enlighten them.

    (1) Use the method of calculating accounts and comparing to criticize the error of relying on the heavens and explain the truth of "man will conquer nature." The representative meeting of propagandists in Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, used this method to first educate the propagandist representatives. Because the masses in Sanjie District of Sheng County were not active in fighting drought, 80% of the villages "welcomed the dragon" and "asked the Bodhisattva," resulting in more than 6,000 mu of rice fields being affected by drought, with a reduction of 200 jin per mu, resulting in a total loss of 1.2 million jin. The lost rice can be converted into money to buy 1,600 head of cattle, which can provide 2,600 people with food for a year. However, because the farmer Lu Qimao actively fought against drought, he used more than ten waterwheels to water the land, resulting in an increase of 15%. This comparison of facts has a great educational effect.

    (2) Organize village cadres and the masses to visit advanced villages and learn from advanced experiences. On the one hand, cadres in various districts of Jun County, Pingyuan, grasped the experience of creating base points, and on the other hand, they promptly organized cadres, model workers, and propagandists from surrounding villages to visit the base point villages. During the visit, the cadres of the base point village and well-drilling experts introduced the experience of mobilizing the masses to drill wells and explained well-drilling techniques. Then the visitors from each village brewed and discussed, combined with reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of well-drilling work in their own village, and initially formulated a well-drilling plan after returning to the village, and carried out a competition movement between villages and villages, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals.

    (3) Summarize and publicize the production experience of local farmers. At first, the farmers in Huijiatun Village, Gaiping County, Liaodong, felt that there was no way to increase production. The Party branch led the propagandists to summarize the production experience of local farmers last year. The summary pointed out that Liu Shaolin planted seven mu and nine fen of cotton last year, using selected cotton seeds, applying full fertilizer, applying two applications of manure, and spraying four applications of medicine. In addition, he planted in a timely manner, overcame uneven droughts and floods, and oil honey insects and other disasters, resulting in more than 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. Liu Zhende's four mu and seven fen of cotton fields only applied eighteen piles of manure per mu, and only harvested 145 jin of seed cotton. Such comparative education not only broke the farmers' idea of ​​"production to the limit," but also mobilized everyone to select seeds from house to house and accumulate fertilizer and purchase a large number of soybean cakes.

    III. Propagandists must lead by example, use practical actions to motivate the masses, and help the masses solve difficulties.

    To make the masses of farmers fully believe in their own propaganda, propagandists must also lead by example and use practical actions to motivate the masses. When mobilizing the masses to carry out spring plowing and drought prevention, Ding Yitang, a propagandist from Dingjiazhuangzi Village, Zhaoyuan County, Shandong, used his own experience of reducing grain production by half due to delayed sowing in previous years to educate the masses and mobilize them to rake the land early; at the same time, he organized with Li Yanbang and other seven households, taking the lead in action, and spent one and a half days to hoe all 19 mu of wheat fields in the whole group and rake eight mu of spring land. Under the influence of his practical actions, the masses of farmers in the village quickly organized and devoted themselves to spring plowing and drought prevention work.

    In addition, in coordination with propaganda activities, propagandists should also help the masses to think of ways, come up with ideas, and overcome difficulties in production. Although the muddled ideas of the farmers in Da Lu Tuan Village, Laiyang County, Shandong, such as paralysis and waiting, relying on the heavens for food, etc., have been eliminated through the propagandists' explanation, they have encountered many difficulties in actual action. For example, drilling a well is not easy to be successful by one person's individual work, so the masses made suggestions to the propagandists. The propagandists reflected the opinions of the masses to the village branch, and the branch, according to the requirements of the masses, organized the entire labor force of the village into twelve well-drilling teams, and organized the semi-labor force to press wheat and rake the land. This solved the manpower problem and strengthened the masses' confidence in drilling wells.

    IV. Promptly mobilize the masses to formulate patriotic production increase plans, revise patriotic covenants, and launch patriotic production increase competition movements.

    On the basis that spring plowing and drought prevention propaganda have penetrated into the hearts of the people and the masses' awareness has been improved, we should promptly mobilize the masses to formulate patriotic production increase plans and initiate patriotic production increase competitions.

    With the establishment of patriotic production increase plans, township and village branches and propagandists should mobilize the vast number of farmers to revise the patriotic covenant. During this spring plowing and drought prevention, the Party organizations and propagandists in some rural areas in North China, Northeast China, and Central South China mobilized the masses of farmers to revise the patriotic covenant centering on the patriotic production increase competition according to the current political tasks, and established a system for regularly checking the patriotic covenant to ensure its implementation. For example, many rural areas in Shanxi Province, under the leadership of local Party organizations, have established a system of holding a "Resist America and Aid Korea Patriotic Day" once or twice a month to check the implementation of the patriotic covenant, promptly compare achievements, and correct shortcomings.

    农村党组织在春耕、防旱中的宣传工作经验
    孙衷文  冯鲁仁
    最近两个多月以来，在春耕、防旱工作中，各地农村宣传网展开了大规模的宣传活动。经过宣传，解除了农民对于增产的怀疑和顾虑，批判了农民群众中的保守思想，从而发扬了农民的生产积极性，提高了农民的爱国主义思想。这些宣传活动，对于运用宣传网推动中心工作，加强农村的思想政治工作，都提供了很多有益的经验。为了进一步推动爱国丰产运动，这些经验是应该加以推广的。
    一、党的县、区委员会要根据生产任务，及时布置宣传工作。
    在布置春耕和防旱工作的同时，许多县委都及时地召开了宣传员代表会议，由负责同志传达今年农业生产的方针和任务，说明春耕和防旱工作的重要，批判“靠天吃饭”、“增产到顶”的错误思想，并领导他们进行讨论，交流过去的宣传工作经验，布置当前的宣传任务。河北省定县专区所属十二个县，还同时由政府召开了人民代表会、村干部扩大会等，共动员了五万多个宣传骨干分子和积极分子参加宣传工作。不少县、区委还组织报告员下乡，到各传授站和各村、镇去作报告，同时检查生产工作，指导宣传网的活动。这就使县、区党委和宣传员的联系更加密切。经过这一系列的步骤，就把宣传任务从县一直布置到村。
    春耕、防旱的宣传任务一经布置到村，村支部就在党、团员会议和宣传员大会上进行动员；同时经过其他各种会议向村干部、人民代表、劳动模范、互助组长、民兵、妇女识字班学员、小学和民校的教员、读报组长、民间艺人等进行动员。然后以党的宣传员为骨干，吸收宣传工作中的积极分子组成强大的宣传队伍，按组、按户、按片分工包干，一齐出动，向全村群众展开宣传活动。大家分头召集互助组会、片会、家庭会、地头会、群众座谈会等，在会上座谈当前的旱象，回忆过去灾荒造成的痛苦，交换解放以来战胜灾荒的经验，总结去年增产的成就，以树立“人定胜天”的思想，发动爱国增产的热潮。
    二、必须针对群众思想，运用生动的事例进行宣传。
    各地农民在防旱和春耕生产中，一方面要求发展生产，另一方面又比较普遍地存在着“靠天吃饭”的消极思想和“增产到顶”的保守思想。要突破农民的这些思想障碍，就得拿出活生生的事实，来启发他们。
    （一）用算账对比的方法，批判靠天思想的错误，说明“人定胜天”的道理。浙江嵊县的宣传员代表会议，就曾用这种方法首先教育了宣传员代表。嵊县三界区的群众因抗旱不积极，百分之八十的村都“迎龙”、“请菩萨”，结果使全区受旱稻田达到了六千多亩，每亩减产以二百斤计，共损失一百二十万斤。损失的稻子折成钱，能买耕牛一千六百头，能供给二千六百人吃一年。而农民吕其茂因为积极抗旱防旱，用了十多部水车浇地，结果增产一成半。这种事实的对比，教育作用很大。
    （二）组织村干部和群众到先进村参观，学习先进经验。平原浚县各区干部一方面掌握基点创造经验，一方面及时组织周围村的干部、劳动模范、宣传员到基点村参观。参观时，由基点村干部及打井能手介绍发动群众打井的经验，讲解打井技术。接着各村参观的人进行酝酿和讨论，并结合检讨本村打井工作的优缺点，初步订了回村后的打井计划，开展村和村、组和组、个人和个人的竞赛运动。
    （三）总结和宣传当地农民的生产经验。辽东盖平县惠家屯村的农民，起初都感觉增产没有办法。党的支部就领导宣传员总结了去年当地农民的生产经验。总结中指出刘绍林去年种七亩九分地的棉花，是粒选的棉种，下满肥、又上了二遍粪，打四遍药水，再加上种得及时，战胜了旱涝不均和油蜜虫等灾害，结果每亩收了三百多斤籽棉。刘振德的四亩七分棉田，每亩只下了十八堆粪，只收了一百四十五斤籽棉。这样进行对比教育，不但打破了农民“生产到顶”的思想，而且把大家动员起来，家家选种，纷纷积攒肥料和购买大批的豆饼。
    三、宣传员必须以身作则，用实际行动带动群众，帮助群众解决困难。
    宣传员要使农民群众完全相信自己的宣传，还必须以身作则，用实际行动带动群众。山东招远县丁家庄子村宣传员丁义堂在动员群众进行春耕、防旱时，一面以自己往年由于拖延下种因而减产粮食一半的亲身经验教育群众，动员群众早耙耢地；一面又和李彦邦等七户组织起来，带头行动，以一天半的时间，将全组十九亩麦田全部锄完，耙耢了八亩春地。该村农民群众在他实际行动的影响下，都很快地组织起来投入春耕、防旱工作。
    另外，配合宣传活动，宣传员还应该帮助群众想办法，出主意，克服生产中的困难。山东莱阳县大吕疃村农民的麻痹等待，靠天吃饭等糊涂思想，虽经宣传员解释而消除，但在实际行动中却碰到许多困难。比如打井，一个人单干就不容易打成功，群众便因此向宣传员提出意见。宣传员把群众的意见反映给村支部，支部根据群众的要求，将全村的整劳动力组织了十二个打井小组，将半劳动力组织起来压麦子、耙地。这样解决了人力问题，也就坚定了群众打井的信心。
    四、及时动员群众订出爱国增产计划，修订爱国公约，开展爱国丰产竞赛运动。
    在春耕、防旱宣传已经深入人心，群众觉悟已经提高的基础上，应该及时地动员群众订出爱国增产计划，发起爱国丰产竞赛。
    随着订立爱国增产计划，乡、村支部和宣传员应该发动广大农民修订爱国公约。华北、东北、中南等地某些农村的党组织和宣传员在这次春耕、防旱中，即曾根据当前的政治任务，动员农民群众以爱国增产竞赛为中心，修订了爱国公约，并建立定期检查爱国公约的制度，来保证爱国公约的执行。例如山西省许多农村在当地党组织的领导下，都建立了每月举行一次或两次“抗美援朝爱国日”的制度，来检查爱国公约的执行状况，及时地评比成绩、纠正缺点。
