    Reading Newspapers Enhances Understanding Between Han and Mongolian Peoples:
    Yangman Ferry Han and Mongolian People in Mutual Aid Production
    Editor: Since the spring plowing and production began, the newspaper reading groups in various districts of Linhe County, Suiyuan Province, have universally launched propaganda work to combat drought and organize production to increase yields. For example, the Mongolian and Han newspaper reading group in Yangman Ferry Village, District One, discussed the benefits of organizing mutual aid work teams. Prior to this, the masses had great ideological concerns, believing that Han and Mongolian farmers could not work together. The Han people said that the Mongolians didn't know how to farm, and the Mongolians said that the Han people had few draft animals, so mutual aid would be a loss. Based on these ideological situations, the newspaper reading group patiently explained the national policy that the Mongolian and Han peoples are one family, and explained the specific benefits of organizing to everyone, breaking down the ideological concerns that the Mongolian and Han people could not produce together. Now, three mutual aid teams have been organized in the whole village on a voluntary basis, with 37 Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen participating, implementing the division of labor between agriculture and animal husbandry. These three mutual aid teams have included all manpower, animal power, and farm tools. They have achieved great results. In this year's spring plowing and sowing work, they completed the task of rush-planting wheat in three days due to good organization. In the past, four Mongolians who had never farmed before have now learned how to farm, and the Han people have also solved the difficulty of lacking animal power. Ling Geli, the head of the mutual aid team, said: "In the past, we could not work with the Han people at all. We can do this this year entirely because of the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Our Mongolian and Han people must unite even more closely in the future to complete the task of increasing production!"

    读报使汉蒙人民彼此更加了解
    杨满渡口汉蒙人民互助生产
    编辑同志：绥远省临河县各区读报组，自从春耕生产开始以来，普遍展开了抗旱防旱，组织起来生产以提高产量的宣传工作。如一区杨满渡口村蒙汉读报组就讨论了组织互助变工组的好处。在此以前，群众思想上的顾虑很大，他们认为：蒙汉农民弄不在一块。汉人说，蒙人不会种地；蒙民说，汉人的耕畜少，这样的互助怕要吃亏。读报组根据这些思想情况，耐心地讲明了蒙汉人民是一家的民族政策，并以组织起来的具体好处来向大家解释，打破了蒙汉之间不能在一起生产的思想顾虑。现在全村已在自觉自愿的基础上组织了三个互助组，共有蒙汉农牧民三十七户参加，实行了农业和牧业的分工。这三个互助组是把所有的人力、畜力和农具都参加进去。他们已获得了很大的成绩。在今年的春耕播种工作中，由于组织得好，他们三天就完成了突击种麦任务。过去有四个从来不会种地的蒙民现在也学会了种地，汉人也解决了缺畜力的困难。互助组长凌阁利说：“往年我们根本不能和汉民在一起干活，今年能这样做，完全是因为共产党和毛主席领导得好的结果。我们蒙民、汉民今后要团结得更紧一些，来完成增产任务！”
