    Brief Commentary on Party Life

    Go Out and Encourage Workers to Innovate and Invent

    In the course of New China's construction, new worker innovations and inventions are constantly emerging. The success of these innovations and inventions is inseparable from the active support of Party organizations. The success of Communist Party member Yang Xiuzhi in creating a binding machine is a clear example. Although Yang Xiuzhi lacked scientific knowledge from books and did not understand machine principles, he had the desire to reform backward tools, a spirit of painstaking research and perseverance, and was able to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. Furthermore, with the active support of the factory's Party committee, he was able to overcome the many obstacles in his path and finally completed a machine that could replace the labor of two hundred people. This not only shows that every Communist Party member, as long as they work diligently and assiduously, has the potential to make greater contributions to the people, but also shows that only with the active support of the Party committee can workers' innovations and inventions be successful.

    The factory Party committee's emphasis on and active support for workers' rationalization proposals and their innovation and invention activities is an important force for increasing production. The Su Changyou bricklaying method in basic construction, the Hao Jianxiu work method in the textile industry, and other advanced work methods in various enterprises were almost all summarized with the direct help of the enterprise Party committee and the factory and mine enterprise management committee. The widespread promotion of these advanced experiences has already played a significant role in the country's production and construction endeavors. In order to further promote the patriotic production increase movement and welcome the high tide of New China's construction, all factory Party committees should attach importance to the advanced production experiences, advanced operating methods, and workers' innovations and inventions in all aspects of their departments. Party organizations in factories should not only provide political encouragement for workers' innovation and invention activities, but also provide convenience in terms of business, and help them to organize their experiences at any time, so that they can continuously improve and achieve success. Even the slightest experiences and nascent ideas created by workers must be valued. In particular, the Party organizations of national technical management agencies should pay more attention to educating technical personnel and actively supporting workers' innovations and inventions. However, in the process of Yang Xiuzhi's creation of the binding machine, individual cadres of the Central Bureau of Technical Administration adopted an erroneous attitude towards workers' creations, which shows that the Party organization of the Bureau of Technical Administration has not done enough in the political and ideological education of technical personnel, and this shortcoming should be corrected in future work.

    党的生活简评
    走出来鼓励工人进行创造和发明
    在新中国建设事业的进程中，工人的新的创造和发明不断发现。这些创造、发明所以能够成功，是和党组织的积极支持分不开的。共产党员杨秀芝创造装订机获得成功就是一个明显的例证。杨秀芝虽然缺乏书本的科学知识，不懂机器原理，但由于他有着改革落后工具的愿望，有着苦心钻研的精神和毅力，能够虚心地听取群众意见，并且有着工厂党委的积极支持，因此他能够克服横亘在前进道路上的重重障碍，终于完成了代替二百个人劳动操作的机器。这不仅说明，每一个共产党员只要顽强刻苦地工作，就有可能给人民以更大的贡献；而且说明，只有党委的积极支持，才能够使工人的创造和发明获得成功。
    工厂党委重视并积极支持工人的合理化建议，以及他们的创造发明活动，乃是提高生产的重要力量。像基本建设中的苏长有砌砖法，纺织工业中的郝建秀工作法，以及其他各种企业中的先进工作法，差不多都是在企业党委和厂矿企业管理委员会直接帮助下总结起来的。这些先进经验的普遍推广，对于国家的生产建设事业已经起了重大的作用。为了进一步开展爱国增产运动，迎接新中国建设的高潮，所有工厂党委都应该重视本部门各个方面的先进生产经验，先进操作方法，以及先进工人的创造和发明。工厂党的组织对于工人的创造发明活动，不仅应当从政治上给以鼓舞，而且应当在业务上给以便利，随时帮助他们整理经验，使他们不断提高，获得成功。那怕是工人创造的点滴经验和萌芽状态的东西，也必须予以重视；特别是国家技术管理机关的党组织更应该注意教育技术人员，积极赞助工人的创造和发明。但是，在杨秀芝创造装订机的过程中，中央技术管理局的个别干部竟对工人的创造采取了错误的态度，这说明技术管理局的党组织对技术人员的政治思想教育还是做得不够的，应该在今后工作中改正这种缺点。
