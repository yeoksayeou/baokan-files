    Ma Hengchang Group and Seven Other Production Teams
    Guarantee to Increase Grain Production by 3,000 Tons This Year
    Respected Chairman Mao: This year's "May Day" Labor Day comes at a time when you are leading the people of the whole country to achieve victory in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles, and it marks the beginning of our country's large-scale economic construction. In order to welcome this great festival, our entire workshop has launched the "Peace Dove" production competition. Everyone is taking the creation of new production records and the saving of grain as a gift to you. When worker Wang Zhanxue of the Ma Hengchang Group was making the No. 1028 dividing plate machine spindle, he used a multi-tool cutting method, using three offset tools to cut simultaneously. The first offset tool cut to a depth of 13 mm, the second to 10 mm, and the third to 7 mm, creating a new record of cutting 30 mm at a time. Liang Jiafan and Jia Tianlin, workers of the Wang Hanqing Advanced Production Team in our Second Workshop, used multi-edged tools to make 140 universal milling steel sockets, making one per minute, creating a new record of exceeding the quota by 15 times. The Ma Guangyuan Group, assisted by Ma Guangyuan, improved the operating method of the oil drawing bed for worker Feng Weicheng. In the past, it took 26 minutes to draw one workpiece, but now it only takes 25 seconds, increasing work efficiency by 60 times. All the workers in the entire workshop, both apprentices and veteran workers, have created new records. The slogan "Create more new records, increase production, and report good news to Chairman Mao as a gift" resounds throughout the entire workshop. All the workers in our entire workshop are currently preparing conditions to propose an industrial patriotic production increase competition to production workshops and production teams throughout the city this year, guaranteeing an increase in grain production of 3,000 tons on top of the state's original production plan.
    The entire workers of the Ma Hengchang Production Team and the Six Production Teams of the Second Workshop

    马恒昌小组等七个生产小组
    保证今年增产粮食三千吨
    敬爱的毛主席：今年的“五一”劳动节，正是您领导全国人民取得“三反”“五反”斗争胜利的时候，是今后我们国家从事大规模经济建设的开始。为了迎接伟大的节日，我们全车间展开了“和平鸽”生产竞赛。每个人都以创造生产新纪录，节约粮食，作为给您的献礼。马恒昌小组的工人王占学，做图号一○二八分盘机主轴时，运用多刀切削法，用三把偏刀同时走刀。第一把偏刀吃刀深度十三粍，第二把十粍，第三把七粍，创造一次吃刀三十粍的新纪录。我们第二车间王汉清先进生产小组工人梁家藩、贾天林用多刃刀做万能铣钢接套一百四十个，一分钟做一个，创造了超过定额十五倍的新纪录。马广元小组，由马广元协助工人冯伟成改进了拉油线床操作方法。过去拉一个工作物需工时二十六分，现在拉一个只需二十五秒，提高工作效率六十倍。全车间不分徒工、老工人都创造了新纪录。“多创造新纪录，多增加生产，向毛主席报捷献礼”的口号响遍整个车间。我们全车间工友正在酝酿条件，准备向全市生产车间、生产小组提出今年工业上的爱国增产竞赛，保证在今年国家生产原计划上，增产粮食三千吨。
