    Cadres in the Third District of Jimo, Shandong, Violate Policies
    Blindly Expanding Cotton Fields and Forcibly Selling Fertilizer
    To the Editor: Last year, the average farmer in the Third District of Jimo County, Shandong, planted four fen of cotton fields. This year, the district people's government emphasized the expansion of cotton fields, forcibly requiring each household to plant an average of two mu of cotton, with cotton seeds supplied by the district cooperative at six jin per mu, priced at 850 yuan per jin. Some farmers whose land was too low-lying to plant cotton were still not permitted to refrain by the district government. Not only that, the district government and the district cooperative also forcibly sold chemical fertilizer to the masses, requiring eight jin to be used per mu of wheat, priced at 1,850 yuan per jin. This price is 50 yuan higher than the district cooperative's previous price of 1,800 yuan, while the listed price in Qingdao was only 1,700 yuan at the time.
    This matter shows that the leading cadres of the Third District Government of Jimo County have a commandist work style, and the district cooperative has a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. The district's emphasis on expanding cotton fields also violates the "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952" issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. The decision clearly states: The sown area of industrial raw material crops and export crops in 1952 should be stabilized at the level of 1951 and not be increased. I suggest that the higher-level authorities promptly investigate and correct this erroneous practice in the district.

### 山东即墨三区干部违反政策  盲目扩大棉田强行推销肥料

    山东即墨三区干部违反政策
    盲目扩大棉田强行推销肥料
    编辑同志：山东即墨县第三区去年平均每户农民种棉田四分。今年区人民政府强调扩大棉田，强制每户平均种棉二市亩，由区合作社供给棉籽，每亩六斤，每斤八百五十元。有的农民因地洼不能种，区政府也不许可。不只如此，区政府和区合作社还向群众强行推销化学肥料，一亩麦子就得使用八斤，每斤一千八百五十元。这个价格比区社过去一千八百元的价格高五十元，而当时青岛市牌价则只一千七百元。
    这件事说明即墨县第三区政府的领导干部有强迫命令作风，区社有单纯营利观点。该区强调扩大棉田，更违反了中央人民政府政务院发布的“关于一九五二年农业生产的决定”。决定中说得很明白：一九五二年工业原料作物和外销作物播种面积稳定在一九五一年的水平上，不予增加。我建议上级机关从速调查并纠正该区的这种错误作法。
