    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 11th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 10th, entitled "Whether the Armistice Negotiations Can Succeed Depends Entirely on the US Attitude," stating: The Korean armistice negotiations are facing a serious crisis due to the US's barbaric delaying and destructive tactics, and this crisis was deliberately created by the US. Our side's representatives, in order to achieve a Korean armistice and satisfy the wishes of peace-loving people worldwide, have been patiently exerting every effort to achieve progress in the negotiations. However, the US is now putting forward absurd proposals, forcing our side to accept them, and deliberately obstructing the progress of the meeting.

    The commentary pointed out: The US takes our sincerity as something to be taken advantage of, and instead responds to our sincere efforts in the negotiations with a shameless attitude of threats and intimidation, which is absolutely unacceptable. The US's insistence on its consistent attitude of delaying or even sabotaging negotiations has aroused the infinite anger of the Korean people and all good people in the world. We will never allow the American aggressors to realize their vicious conspiracy of forcibly detaining more than 100,000 of our captured personnel and handing them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs.

    The US attempts to conceal its sinister motives of detaining our prisoners of war with all kinds of cunning words. However, the continuous anti-persecution movements and loud calls for unconditional repatriation by our captured personnel in the US prisoner-of-war camps such as Geoje Island cannot be concealed by the US.

    The commentary finally emphasized: The US must know that our side can never consider the US's shameless demands and barbaric requests under any circumstances. The US must abandon their sinister conspiracy, accept our fair and reasonable plan, and resolve the remaining issues in the armistice negotiations. Whether the Korean armistice negotiations can succeed depends entirely on the US attitude.

    斥美方蛮横阻挠谈判
    【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜中央通讯社十日以“停战谈判能否成功完全在于美方的态度如何”为题，发表评论说：朝鲜停战谈判因美方蛮横的拖延与破坏手段而面临严重危机，这个危机是美方有意制造的。我方代表为了实现朝鲜停战，满足全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，一直耐心地为求得谈判的进展而竭尽一切努力。但是，美方现在却又提出了荒谬绝伦的提案强迫我方接受，故意阻挠了会议的进展。
    评论指出：美方以我方的诚意为可欺，反而以威胁、恐吓的无耻态度来回答我方在谈判中的真挚努力，这是绝对行不通的。美方坚持其一贯的随时拖延甚至破坏谈判的态度，已引起了朝鲜人民和全世界善良人民的无限愤怒。我们绝不能容许美国侵略者实现其强行扣留十万名以上我方被俘人员把他们交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的凶恶阴谋。
    美方企图以种种狡猾的言词来掩饰其扣留我方战俘的罪恶居心。但是在美方巨济岛等俘虏收容所中的我方被俘人员连续举行的反迫害运动与要求无条件遣返的响亮呼声，是美方所掩饰不了的。
    评论最后强调说：美方必须知道，我方在任何情况下也绝对不能考虑美方的这种无耻主张与蛮横要求。美方必须放弃他们的罪恶阴谋，接受我方公平合理的方案，以解决停战谈判中的剩余问题。朝鲜停战谈判的能否成功，完全在于美方的态度如何。
