Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th TASS: Moscow fired a thirty-gun salute on the evening of the 9th to commemorate the anniversary of the victory over fascist Germany. Many colorful rockets soared into the sky, illuminating the streets and squares crowded with hundreds of thousands of Moscow citizens. Movie theaters, clubs, and cultural palaces in the Soviet capital screened "The Fall of Berlin," "The Great Battle of Stalingrad," and other films about the Soviet army's historically significant victories in the Great Patriotic War. Lectures and symposiums on Victory Day and gatherings with combat heroes were held everywhere.

Celebrations of Victory Day were also held in the capitals of the various republics, in Kaliningrad, Lviv, and in the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th, TASS Moscow, 9th: On May 8th, the anniversary of Germany's liberation, Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, and Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl sent telegrams to Nikolai Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Joseph Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, respectively. They expressed gratitude for the heroic Soviet army's liberation of the German people from Hitler's fascist rule seven years ago, and thanked the Soviet government for its consistent policy of peace and friendship towards the German people after the war, as well as its support and assistance for the German people's struggle for unification, independence, and the cause of peaceful, democratic construction.

In his congratulatory telegram, Grotewohl pointed out that American imperialism and its Bonn German lackeys are using German territory to conquer Europe, and this threat to European peace poses a danger of civil war and complete destruction to Germany. He assured that the people and government of the German Democratic Republic will continue to tirelessly fight for the defense of peace.

Shvernik and Stalin also sent telegrams to Pieck and Grotewohl, respectively, congratulating the German people on their liberation and wishing the German people and the government of the German Democratic Republic victory in their struggle for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, and for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

The Smetana Theater was filled with political figures and social celebrities of the republic, representatives of all political groups belonging to the National Front, male and female shock workers from Prague factories, and recipients of state awards.

Portraits of Marshal Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin and the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Klement Gottwald, hung in front of a five-pointed red star on the stage, which was decorated with many Czechoslovak and Soviet flags. Above the red star was a slogan that read: "Strengthen the unbreakable friendship with our liberator, the mighty bastion of world peace, the Soviet Union!"
