    Beijing Water Company Workers Work Actively
    Mentougou People Have Been Drinking Tap Water Since May Day
    Comrade Editor: Before May Day, tap water in Mentougou could not meet the needs of residents. Next to some water stations, residents lined up a long string of buckets waiting to collect water. Local residents had requested the People's Government to improve this situation. In order to welcome May Day, the workers of the Beijing Water Company decided to complete the project of adding tap water in Mentougou with a concentrated effort. The design of this project only began on April 25th. When the citizens of Mentougou heard this news, they were extremely excited. Zhang, the town head of Mentougou, said, "Everyone is prepared to volunteer labor, without the need for mobilization." Resident Zhao Xueqin went home and told her husband, and she immediately said, "I will volunteer my labor." After the project started, many residents helped the workers of the Beijing Water Company. When it rained, the workers continued to work as usual, and even more vigorously. They said, "It is important for the residents of Mentougou to have water, what does a little rain matter!" Although this project was only 600 meters long, there were many difficulties. It had to cross a rocky gully, make several turns, the terrain was uneven, and it had to cross a bridge and a railway. These difficulties were overcome by the workers. Relying on the active work of the workers and residents, the people of Mentougou were able to drink clean tap water on May Day.

    北京自来水公司工人积极工作
    门头沟的人民从“五一”节那天起都喝到了自来水
    编辑同志：门头沟的自来水，在“五一”劳动节以前是供应不上居民需要的。有的水站旁，居民摆着很长的一连串的水桶等着打水。当地居民曾要求人民政府改善这种情况。北京自来水公司的工人为了迎接“五一”劳动节，决定突击完成门头沟增设自来水的工程。这个工程在四月二十五日才开始设计。门头沟市民一听到这个消息，都兴奋极了。门头沟镇张镇长表示：“大家准备献工帮助，不用号召。”居民赵雪琴回家跟爱人一说，她立刻说：“我义务献工。”工程开始动工后，很多居民帮着自来水公司的工人干活。天下了雨，工人们照常干下去，而且更起劲。他们说：“门头沟居民吃水重要，下点雨算什么！”这个工程虽然不过六百公尺长，但困难很多。通过石头的沟，要拐好几个弯，地势也高低不平，又过桥，又过铁道。这些困难都被工人们克服了。依靠工人和居民的积极工作，门头沟的人民在“五一”节那一天都喝到清洁的自来水了。
