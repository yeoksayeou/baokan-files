Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: Professor Zhao Zhongyao, an atomic physics expert and researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently spoke to our reporter regarding the U.S. aggressors' preparation to use atomic weapons, saying:

    I read with extreme anger the confessions of U.S. Air Force prisoners of war Kenneth Lloyd Inach and John Quinn about how they participated in the inhumane bacteriological warfare launched by the U.S. aggressors. From their confessions, it is not only more fully proven that U.S. imperialism, disregarding the firm opposition of the people of the world, has committed the crime of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, but it also exposes the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to further prepare for atomic warfare.

    For the two years since U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it has suffered irreparable defeat under the staunch blows of the Chinese and Korean people and with the support of peace-loving people all over the world. Today, the U.S. aggressors, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world and unafraid of righteous sanctions, have not only carried out bacteriological warfare that violates humanity and is genocidal, but even want to further resort to atomic weapons. Although atomic weapons have a certain destructive power, they are not as frightening as they appear with sufficient precaution. Like bacteriological weapons, they cannot save U.S. imperialism from defeat in Korea. If U.S. imperialism dares to start using atomic weapons, we can conclude that bacteriological weapons, atomic weapons, and the aggressors themselves will be crushed by the powerful force of the people of the world!

    Professor Zhao Zhongyao finally said: A-rays, B-rays, and C-rays mentioned in the confessions were formerly translated as Jia rays, Yi rays, and Bing rays. If translated phonetically from Greek letters, they can be called Alpha rays, Beta rays, and Gamma rays. The translation of "radiation activity" should be "radioactivity." The A-rays and B-rays mentioned by prisoner Quinn should be the thermal radiation generated by the atomic bomb. Because this specialized knowledge is not familiar to general military personnel, the prisoner could not fully remember it, hence the error.

    我国原子物理学专家赵忠尧教授发表谈话
    斥美帝国主义准备使用原子武器的阴谋
    【新华社十四日讯】我国原子物理学专家、中国科学院研究员赵忠尧教授，顷就美国侵略者准备使用原子武器向本社记者发表谈话说：
    我在极端愤怒的心情下，阅读了美国空军俘虏凯尼斯·罗埃德·伊纳克和约翰·奎恩关于他们如何参加了美国侵略者发动的非人道的细菌战的供词。从他们的供词中，不但更充分地证明了美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的坚决反对，在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行，同时暴露了美帝国主义正在进一步准备原子战争的阴谋。
    美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的两年以来，在中朝人民的坚强打击和全世界爱好和平人民的声援下，遭受到不可挽救的失败。今天，美国侵略者竟然不顾全世界人民的反对，不惧正义的制裁，不仅进行了违反人道、灭绝人性的细菌战争，甚至于更想进一步乞灵于原子武器。原子武器虽然有它一定的破坏能力，但是在充分的注意之下，它并没有可以吓人的地方。和细菌武器一样，它决不能够挽救美帝国主义在朝鲜的失败。假如美帝国主义胆敢开始使用原子武器，我们可以断定：细菌武器、原子武器、连同侵略者自己，都要被粉碎在全世界人民的强大力量的面前！
    赵忠尧教授最后说：供词中所说A射线、B射线、和C射线，从前译作甲射线、乙射线、和丙射线。倘使从希腊字母译音，它们可以叫做阿尔发射线、贝塔射线和嘎玛射线。译名“辐射活动”应该是“放射性”。俘虏奎恩所说的A射线和B射线，应该是原子弹所产生的热辐射。因为这种专门知识，非一般军事人员所熟悉，该俘虏不能完全记忆，所以有这错误。
