Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The people of the Eastern European People's Democracies are extremely angry at the atrocities committed by the American aggressors in the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoji Island. According to TASS, German public opinion is deeply indignant at the atrocities of the American militarists. The "Berliner Zeitung" wrote about the crimes of the American militarists: "Geoji Island in South Korea was once a peaceful island, but today it has become a hell surrounded by barbed wire, imprisoning tens of thousands of people. It is a hell where women, children, and the elderly driven from North Korea are tortured, and a hell where captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers are devastated." "Deutsche Nachrichten" pointed out: "Western news agencies subsequently emphasized that every Korean soldier and every Chinese People's Volunteer captured by the United States wanted to return home as soon as possible."

The Polish people despise the despicable crimes of the American aggressors in Korea. The Polish newspaper "Głos Pracy" commented on the admission by former Geoji Island US prisoner-of-war camp commander Colson that the US imperialists persecuted Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, saying that the United Nations flag used by the United States to cover up its aggression in Korea is now being used to cover up the heinous crimes committed by the US military authorities against unarmed prisoners of war. The newspaper wrote about the panic caused by Colson's statement in the Washington ruling group: The United States' attempt to quell the anger of hundreds of millions of people around the world with shameless lies will not succeed. "Głos Pracy" said: It is impossible to deny that the crimes of the heinous US imperialists are worse than the atrocities of the Hitler criminals.

The people of Czechoslovakia feel boundless anger at the news of the bloody suppression by the American aggressors of captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on Geoji Island. The central organ of the Czechoslovak trade unions, "Práce," published an article entitled "Hellish Life in the Geoji Island Prisoner-of-War Camp," exposing the crime of the American interventionists attempting to detain more than 100,000 prisoners of war under the guise of "screening." The newspaper said that the US military would not hesitate to commit the most heinous crimes to persecute prisoners of war.

"Práce" listed many facts of the American aggressors' abuse of prisoners of war on Geoji Island, and contrasted them with the hypocritical statement of US President Truman that the US interventionist forces in Korea were pursuing "humanitarian" goals.

Newspapers in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, unanimously expressed indignation at the American aggressors' barbaric abuse of prisoners of war on Geoji Island. "Scînteia" wrote: All working people are deeply indignant after hearing the news of the atrocities committed by the American aggressors on Geoji Island. The Geoji Island prisoner-of-war camp is the same as Hitler's death camps—Buchenwald, Auschwitz, and Majdanek concentration camps. The Geoji Island incident fully demonstrates that the US representatives' claim in the Korean armistice negotiations that the US side treats prisoners of war very humanely is a complete lie. "Scînteia" continued: The Romanian people, together with the working people of all countries, resolutely protest the atrocities committed by American war criminals in Korea and demand that the criminals be severely punished.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS, New York, 19th: The admission by US General Colson that the US military had cruelly persecuted prisoners of war on Geoji Island has caused panic among the US ruling group; American newspapers can no longer cover it up. "Daily Mirror" observer Pearson wrote: The reaction of General Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to General Colson's statement proves that: "The extremely serious failure on Geoji Island has alarmed Washington and damaged our international relations."

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS, London, 18th: The editor of "Reynolds News" wrote a long article on the US refusal to repatriate prisoners of war in Korea. He wrote: "Before the hope of resolving the Korean issue through an agreement is completely dashed by the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war, we must seriously consider this issue. In my opinion, we are beginning to adopt a position based on bad 'law', dubious 'humanitarianism' and questionable facts." The article stated that the recent Geoji Island incident has made people no longer believe the US reports about the situation on Geoji Island, nor the "screening" method adopted by the US. The editor of "Reynolds News" wrote: "After the Dode and Colson incidents, people will no longer believe the US claim that prisoners of war do not want to return to their homeland."

A "Observer" correspondent who recently returned to the UK from Korea admitted that some prisoner-of-war camps on Geoji Island were controlled by Chiang Kai-shek's lackeys. The correspondent pointed out that the "courts" in the prisoner-of-war camps "practiced corporal punishment and torture on prisoners of war, and even sentenced them to hanging. More than eighty prisoners of war were hanged in the prisoner-of-war camps; as for corporal punishment and torture, they were practiced every night in many prisoner-of-war camps." The correspondent also wrote: The lives of prisoners of war under the custody of the US military are in grave danger!

    对于美国屠杀我被俘人员的血腥罪行
    东欧人民民主国家人民极表愤慨
    美英报刊承认巨济岛事件引起美统治集团慌乱
    【新华社二十日讯】东欧人民民主国家人民对于美国侵略者在巨济岛战俘营中的暴行极为愤怒。据塔斯社消息，德国舆论界对美国干涉军在朝鲜的暴行深表愤慨。“柏林日报”就美国军国主义者的罪行写道：“南朝鲜的巨济岛以前是个和平的岛屿，今天却已变成了用铁丝网围住的、监禁着成千成万人的地狱了。这是一座折磨从北朝鲜赶去的妇女老幼的地狱，也是一座摧残朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的地狱。”“德意志新闻”指出：“西方各国的通讯社随后着重指出，被美国俘掳的每个朝鲜士兵和每个中国志愿军士兵都想尽快地回家。”
    波兰人民鄙视美国侵略者在朝鲜的可恶罪行。波兰报纸“劳动之声”就前巨济岛美国战俘营负责人柯尔生承认美帝国主义者迫害朝中战俘一事发表评论说：美国用来掩饰它在朝鲜的侵略行为的联合国旗帜，现在又被用来掩饰美国军事当局对手无寸铁的战俘犯下的滔天罪行了。该报谈到柯尔生的声明在华盛顿统治集团中引起的恐慌情绪时写道：美国企图用无耻的谎言来平息全世界亿万人民的愤怒，这种企图是不会成功的。“劳动之声”说：穷凶极恶的美帝国主义的罪行，比希特勒罪犯们的暴行有过之无不及，要否认这个事实是不可能的。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民对于美国侵略者对巨济岛上朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员施行血腥镇压的消息，感到无比的愤怒。捷克斯洛伐克工会的中央机关报“劳动报”发表了一篇题为“巨济岛战俘营中的地狱生活”的文章，揭发美国干涉者企图在“甄别”的幌子下扣留十万多战俘的罪行。该报说，美国军方不惜干出最可恶的罪行来迫害战俘。
    “劳动报”列举了美国侵略者虐待巨济岛战俘的许多事实，又引证美国总统杜鲁门所谓美国干涉军在朝鲜追求“人道”目标的伪善声明，将两者作了一个鲜明的对比。
    罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特的报纸对美国侵略者野蛮虐待巨济岛战俘的罪行一致表示愤慨。“火花报”写道：全体劳动人民听到美国侵略者在巨济岛所犯的暴行的消息后，深为愤慨。巨济岛战俘营是和希特勒的死亡营——布痕瓦尔德、奥斯威辛和麦丹尼克集中营——一模一样的东西。巨济岛事件充分说明美方代表在朝鲜停战谈判中所称美方对待战俘非常人道的说法完全是骗人的谎言。“火花报”接着说：罗马尼亚人民和一切国家的劳动人民一道，坚决抗议美国战争罪犯在朝鲜所犯的暴行，并要求严厉惩办罪犯。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：美国柯尔生将军承认了美军对巨济岛上战俘横加迫害一事，引起了美国统治集团的慌乱；美国报纸已无法加以掩饰。“每日镜报”观察家皮尔逊写道：参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷将军对柯尔生将军声明的反应证明：“巨济岛上极为严重的失败，使华盛顿为之惊慌，并且破坏了我们的国际关系”。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦十八日讯：“雷诺新闻”的编者就美国拒绝遣返在朝鲜的战俘一事撰写长篇文章。他写道：“在通过协定解决朝鲜问题的希望还没有因遣返战俘问题而完全破灭以前，我们必须十分严肃地考虑这个问题。依我看来，我们是开始采取以恶劣的‘法律’、可疑的‘人道主义’和可疑的事实为根据的立场了。”该文称：最近巨济岛事件已使人不再相信美国关于巨济岛情况的报道，也使人不再相信美国采取的“甄别”方式了。“雷诺新闻”的编者写道：“杜德与柯尔生事件发生以后，人们不会再相信美国所谓战俘不愿回他们的祖国的说法了。”
    最近一个从朝鲜返英国的“观察家报”特派记者承认：巨济岛上有些战俘营是由蒋介石的走狗掌管的。该记者指出：战俘营的“法庭”“对战俘实行体罚与拷打，甚至判处绞刑。在战俘营被绞杀的战俘达八十多人；至于体罚与拷打在许多战俘营是每天晚上都有的”。该记者还写道：在美军看管下的战俘，性命岌岌可危！
