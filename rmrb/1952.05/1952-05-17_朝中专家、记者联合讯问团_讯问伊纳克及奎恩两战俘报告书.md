    I. Origin of the Team

    The American aggressors, disregarding international law and humanitarian principles, have frantically waged bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China. Despite the universal condemnation and angry protests of people around the world, the American aggressors have shown no remorse. On the one hand, they continue to spread bacteria in Korea and China, and on the other hand, they shamelessly deny their heinous crimes and viciously fabricate rumors to slander the Korean and Chinese people. All the sophistry and denials of the American aggressors are completely futile. In addition to collecting a large amount of testimony and material evidence in the front and rear of Korea and in Northeast China, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers shot down an American invading military aircraft in the Anju area northwest of Pyongyang on January 13 this year, capturing the navigator Kenneth Lloyd Enoch and the pilot John Silas Quinn. Since being captured, the two prisoners of war have been treated leniently by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, gradually realizing the seriousness of their crimes. They confessed that they had been ordered by the American military authorities invading Korea to drop bacteriological bombs several times at different times and places in Korea, providing the most powerful and irrefutable evidence of the American aggressors' brutal bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people. The Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression jointly initiated the formation of the "Joint Korean-Chinese Expert and Journalist Interrogation Team" to interrogate the two American air force prisoners in a prisoner-of-war camp in Korea, in order to publicize this fact to the people of the world and thoroughly expose the various shameless lies of the American government. French Paris Tonight reporter Pierre Béguin was also invited to participate in the work of the interrogation team.

    II. The Interrogation Process

    After arriving at a certain prisoner-of-war camp in Korea, the team interrogated the two prisoners of war, Enoch and Quinn, in groups and as a whole. From May 1st to May 8th, a total of six interrogations were conducted. The two prisoners of war confessed to the team their respective histories before and after being captured, their training in bacteriological warfare, and the circumstances under which they were ordered to drop bacteriological bombs.

    Enoch and Quinn were captured simultaneously by a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the night of January 13 this year.

    At 21:45 on the night of January 13, they were ordered to fly a B-26 bomber, No. 600 (Note: American aircraft numbers are generally five digits, but in the US Air Force, for ease of memory, only the last three of the five digits are mentioned when referring to aircraft numbers, so No. 600 refers to ××600) with bombardier Lt. Dournes and mechanic Sgt. Camplell, a total of four people, from Gunsan base in southern Korea to bomb Anju. At 23:30, they arrived over the target and were hit by anti-aircraft fire from a unit of the Korean and Chinese forces. Dournes and Camplell were killed instantly. Quinn and Enoch parachuted to the ground one after another and were immediately captured.

    Enoch is a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number AO-2069988. He graduated from middle school in January 1943, joined the U.S. Army Air Corps on June 7, 1943, and retired in 1947. When U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea in 1950, he was recalled into the army. On August 13, 1951, he was transferred to Japan, and on September 1, he was transferred to Gunsan Air Force Base in Korea, where he was assigned to the 8th Bombardment Squadron of the 3rd Light Bombardment Group of the 5th Air Force of the U.S. Air Force as a B-26 navigator. Enoch confessed that the commander of the 3rd Light Bombardment Wing was Colonel Ohman, the commander of the 3rd Light Bombardment Group was Colonel Morgan, and the commander of the 8th Bombardment Squadron was Lt. Col. Leahy.

    Quinn is a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, service number 17993A. After graduating from middle school, he studied at the Naval Academy for four years. He joined the U.S. Air Force on February 16, 1948. On August 25, 1951, he was transferred to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to learn to fly B-26 aircraft. On November 30, he was transferred to Gunsan Air Force Base in Korea and was assigned to the 8th Bombardment Squadron with Enoch as a B-26 pilot.

    Quinn confessed that he had flown with Enoch on five occasions. However, they said they never flew together when dropping bacteriological bombs.

    Both prisoners of war confessed that they had received secret training in conducting bacteriological warfare. Enoch confessed that he had attended three lectures on bacteriological warfare. The first lecture was on the afternoon of August 25, 1951, from 13:00 to 15:00, at the Ground School of Iwakuni Air Force Base in Japan. The lecturer was a civilian named Wilson. The latter two lectures were in October and December of last year at Gunsan Air Force Base in Korea. The lecturer was Major Browning. Quinn confessed that he had attended one lecture on bacteriological warfare at Gunsan Air Force Base on December 18 last year. The lecturer was a civilian named Ashfork. Both prisoners of war unanimously confessed that the lecturers stated that the content of the lectures must be kept strictly confidential and not disclosed to anyone. In order to maintain secrecy, the bacteriological bombs were called "non-explosive bombs."

    The U.S. invading forces in Korea conducted bacteriological warfare training for U.S. Air Force personnel on a large scale. According to Enoch, Major Browning's bacteriological warfare course "was held regularly, and everyone had to attend." When new air force units were rotated to Gunsan Air Force Base, this course was held for training. According to Enoch, among the pilots who attended the secret bacteriological warfare course given by Wilson on August 25, were Capt. Frank Lemark, 1st Lt. Guy Broughton, 1st Lt. Eldon Schmidt; among the navigators, in addition to himself, were Capt. Kenneth Carson, Capt. Nelson, 1st Lt. Charls Garvin, 1st Lt. Emmett Hardy, 1st Lt. Roy Dagaugh, 1st Lt. Ronald Brown, 2nd Lt. Larry Zielinski, 2nd Lt. John Larson, etc. According to Quinn, among the pilots who attended the secret bacteriological warfare course given by Ashfork were Capt. Carry Land, Capt. Howarth, 1st Lt. Schmidt, Capt. Robertson, Capt. Beason, 1st Lt. Mcallister; navigators: Capt. Long, Capt. Francis x. Duffy, 2nd Lt. John Larson, 1st Lt. Schwartz, 1st Lt. William Watson, 1st Lt. Rogers, 2nd Lt. Robert Robests.

    According to Enoch, he first attended the bacteriological warfare course on August 25, 1951. This date is noteworthy, as it proves that the U.S. invading forces in Korea had already begun large-scale bacteriological warfare training at least in late August of last year. The inhuman crimes against the Korean people and the Korean and Chinese forces were premeditated for a long time.

    The weapons used by the U.S. invading forces in Korea and Northeast China for bacteriological warfare were diverse, and the methods were malicious and insidious. This has been fully proven by the materials confessed by the two American Air Force prisoners of war, Enoch and Quinn. According to Enoch, when he received training on bacteriological warfare, the lecturer Wilson told him about various weapons for conducting bacteriological warfare, such as spraying devices on aircraft for spraying germ-carrying dust in the air; bacteriological bombs that opened in mid-air, spreading germ-carrying dust with the wind; bacteriological bombs that opened on the ground, containing germ-carrying insects; paper containers that cracked open after landing, containing germ-carrying insects; various containers with parachutes, containing small animals carrying germ-carrying insects; germ-carrying leaflets, fountain pens, clothing, and food; and containers filled with bacteria, thrown into rivers and reservoirs to contaminate the water and harm humans and animals. Quinn's account of the weapons and methods of bacteriological warfare used by the United States was generally the same as the above, but he confessed to four different types of bacteriological bombs, all of which resembled ordinary 500-pound explosive bombs in appearance.

    The American aggressors used many kinds of germs harmful to humans in their bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. This has been confirmed by both the Korean and Chinese sides and by the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers who investigated the bacteriological warfare conducted by the United States. This time, the confessions of the American Air Force prisoners of war, Enoch and Quinn, further confirmed this point. According to the confessions of the two prisoners of war, Wilson, Browning, and Ashfork, who lectured on the bacteriological warfare course, explained in detail the bacteria, rickettsiae, diseases, and protozoa that could be used to conduct bacteriological warfare, such as bubonic plague, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, typhus, smallpox, yellow fever, encephalitis, and malaria. Enoch confessed that Wilson also mentioned how to use "many terrible, strange, and rarely heard of bacteria."

    The lecturers also mentioned many insects that could be used to carry germs, such as flies, fleas, mosquitoes, and lice. Quinn confessed that the lecturer Ashfork stated that "almost any insect can be used to spread bacteria," and that insects "can be selected and cultivated to be cold-resistant and can live for a long time without eating." "Bacteria can be spread by many different insects and rodents, which have been cultivated in the laboratory for several generations, so that they can survive at any time and in any place, even under the most unfavorable conditions, and have been selected."

    According to the confessions of the two prisoners of war, the lecturers of the bacteriological warfare course told them that aircraft should fly lower and slower when dropping bacteriological bombs than when dropping ordinary explosive bombs in order to protect the lives of the germ-carrying insects inside the bombs. The lecturers of the bacteriological warfare course also explained that bacteria could harm the personnel conducting bacteriological warfare themselves, so they also taught various methods of preventing bacterial diseases.

    The two prisoners of war also described in detail to the team the process of dropping bacteriological bombs: Enoch flew twice to drop bacteriological bombs, once on January 7, dropping two in Huangzhou; another time on January 11, dropping four in Zhonghe. Quinn also dropped bombs twice, the first time on January 4, dropping four southeast of Pyongyang; the second time on January 11, dropping two north of Gunuri. The entire process of these four bombings - the secret briefings they received before the mission, the special circumstances before boarding the plane, the bombing process, and the reports upon returning from the mission - undoubtedly showed that what they dropped were bacteriological bombs.

    (1) Secret briefing: Before Enoch's two missions, the briefing officer clearly told him in his orders that he was going to drop bacteriological bombs.

    Before Quinn's two missions, the briefing officer used the name "non-explosive bombs" to replace bacteriological bombs in his orders both times.

    (2) Circumstances before boarding: Before each of the four missions of Enoch and Quinn, they found guards next to the plane each time before boarding and were told that the bombs on the wings had been checked and that they were forbidden to check them again. Usually, when performing tasks, the navigator would routinely check all the bombs, without exception.

    Enoch and Quinn both noticed that the bacteriological bombs carried on the wings looked very much like ordinary 500-pound explosive bombs, as they had heard in the bacteriological warfare training course. However, they found that the bacteriological bombs had no detonating fuses. Detonating fuses are indispensable on ordinary explosive bombs.

    (3) Bombing process: The briefing officer ordered Enoch and Quinn to fly low each time they dropped bacteriological bombs, with an altitude not exceeding 500 feet. They carried out the order. Enoch flew to 500 feet each time the plane dropped bacteriological bombs; Quinn even flew as low as 200 feet when dropping bombs. As a result, the bombs dropped were all "non-explosive bombs," as the briefing officer had told them in advance. Such an altitude is definitely not for dropping ordinary 500-pound explosive bombs. The minimum safe altitude for dropping ordinary 500-pound explosive bombs is about 1,200 feet or more.

    (4) Report: When returning from the mission to report, Enoch and Quinn reported the bacteriological bombs as "non-explosive bombs" each time, as the briefing officer had told them in advance. In order to prevent more people within them from knowing the secret of dropping bacteriological bombs, the U.S. Air Force stipulated that "non-explosive bombs" should be used as the code name for bacteriological bombs when reporting.

    The circumstances of Enoch and Quinn's four bombings were similar. In order to make the above four points clearer, the following is a detailed account of Enoch's mission to drop bacteriological bombs on January 7 as an example. Enoch confessed as follows:

    "The day before the mission, that is, at 2:00 p.m. on January 6, at Gunsan Air Force Base, the pilot of my plane, Capt. William Amos, the mechanic Sgt. Richard Tracy and I went to the briefing room of the 3rd Bombardment Group to receive orders for the next day's mission. The briefing officer of the group was Capt. Gilbert Carey. It was planned that 24 aircraft would take off from the evening of January 6 to the morning of January 7, each aircraft in a group, each group with three or four people, all in the room. Our group was ordered to take off at 3:00 a.m. the next morning to carry out a mission on the so-called '8th Green Bombing Route' between Pyongyang and Sariwon."

    "At 2:00 a.m. on January 7, Amos and I reported to the group operations officer as usual to see if the orders had changed. Capt. Robert Stuart, the group operations officer, orally ordered us: the two bombs on the outer racks of our aircraft wings are bacteriological bombs, which are to be dropped in Huangzhou. When dropping the bombs, the maximum altitude of the aircraft must not exceed 500 feet, and the maximum speed must not exceed 200 miles per hour. Someone has already checked the two bacteriological bombs for us, and we don't need to check them again. After the bacteriological bombs are dropped, we should drop the other bombs as soon as possible and fly back to the base to report; when reporting, these two bacteriological bombs should be referred to as 'non-explosive bombs' to ensure secrecy."

    "When Stuart gave such a confidential order, only Stuart himself, Amos, and I were in the room. The other groups were waiting outside the room. This situation was very special, because usually when going to receive a briefing before taking off, there were often two or three groups in the room at the same time."

    "After listening to the secret order, we came out with Tracy and walked to our B-26 aircraft, No. 247 (Note: also refers to the last three digits of the aircraft number). There was a guard sent by the ordnance section next to the aircraft, who told us that the bombs on the wings had been checked and there was no need to check them again. I checked the six 500-pound explosive bombs in the bomb bay of the fuselage. The B-36 aircraft can carry two bombs on each wing, which are mounted on the outer and inner racks, for a total of four bombs on both wings. I noticed that the two bacteriological bombs mounted on the outer racks and the ordinary 500-pound explosive bombs mounted on the inner racks next to them looked very similar in appearance. However, the bacteriological bombs did not have the detonating fuses that ordinary bombs have."

    "Such a situation of sending guards to guard aircraft loaded with bacteriological bombs has never happened when performing ordinary bombing missions. We always check all the bombs before taking off."

    "We took off from Gunsan on time at 3:00 a.m. and followed the predetermined route, first westward to the airspace above Yeonpyeong Island, and from there flew north via Haeju. The aircraft flew at an altitude of 7,500 feet and did not encounter anti-aircraft fire along the way. Approaching Sariwon, the aircraft flew low to about 500 feet and flew directly to Huangzhou, about ten miles away from Sariwon. When the aircraft flew about a quarter or a fifth of a mile west of Huangzhou, the pilot pressed the button on the control stick and dropped two bacteriological bombs. Both bombs fell into Huangzhou and did not explode upon impact. I noted these two 'non-explosive bombs' on the record. The aircraft was flying level when dropping the bombs. The flying altitude was about 500 feet, and the speed was 200 miles per hour. Under normal circumstances, when dropping 500-pound explosive bombs, the minimum altitude of the aircraft is about 1,200 feet. If it is lower, the explosion of the bomb will endanger the aircraft."

    "After the two bacteriological bombs were dropped, the aircraft climbed to 1,500 feet and flew over the highway five miles north of Huangzhou. The pilot dropped the remaining eight 500-pound bombs one after another, and then flew back to the intersection of the Daedong River and the sea near Nampo, and from there flew directly to Yeonpyeong Island to return to Gunsan. It was 5:00 a.m. in Gunsan." "When the mission was completed and we returned to report, we reported that the two bacteriological bombs dropped in Huangzhou were 'non-explosive bombs', except for reporting the general situation when landing."

    According to the confessions of the two prisoners, the time when the U.S. aircraft began to drop bacteriological bombs was no later than January 1 this year. Enoch confessed that he was ordered to drop bacteriological bombs on January 1, but was replaced by someone else due to a cold. Quinn said that on December 31 of last year, he heard the group operations officer convey the order that from then on, everyone must report all "non-explosive bombs" when reporting. The bacteriological warfare conducted by the American aggressors was large-scale, and it had been carrying out bacteriological warfare training among a large number of air force personnel for a long time. There were many U.S. Air Force personnel who had dropped bacteriological bombs. Even though they strictly stipulated that secrets should be kept, Quinn knew that there were at least Lt. Schmidt, 2nd Lt. Larson, and Capt. Duffy in the 8th Bombardment Squadron to which Enoch and Quinn belonged. Larson told Quinn that he had dropped four bacteriological bombs southeast of Pyongyang on the night of January 4, and Schmidt said that he had dropped four bacteriological bombs northeast of Gunuri; Duffy also told Quinn that he had dropped bacteriological bombs southeast of Pyongyang on the night of January 5.

    III. Conclusion

    Based on the above facts, we draw the following conclusions:

    First, the fact that the American aggressors conducted bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people is completely conclusive. The above evidence is provided not by others, but by U.S. Air Force personnel Enoch and Quinn, who personally dropped bacteriological bombs in Korea several times in accordance with the orders of the U.S. military authorities. This is a fact that the U.S. military and political leaders and their propaganda organs, who are accustomed to lying and denying, cannot deny and cannot deny at all.

    Second, the bacteriological warfare conducted by the American aggressors against the Korean and Chinese people was carried out after long-term and thorough preparation and was a completely planned action. As early as the end of 1950, when the American aggressors fled from northern Korea, they had spread germs. Before launching this large-scale bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people, they had already begun bacteriological warfare training for U.S. invading Korean Air Force personnel at least on August 25, 1951. The content of the training was extensive and thorough, including the types and structures of bacteriological weapons, the containers and methods for spreading bacteria, the precautions that should be taken when dropping bacteriological bombs, and how to prevent the spread of epidemics to their own troops and regions. This shows that this barbaric and brutal criminal act of the American aggressors was premeditated and prepared long ago.

    Third, the American aggressors' attempt to use bacteriological weapons to kill the Korean and Chinese people was carried out in extremely secret circumstances. In order to cover up this heinous and brutal criminal act, the lecturers of the U.S. bacteriological warfare repeatedly told the listeners that the content of this course was extremely secret and could not be discussed casually even among U.S. Air Force personnel. When the two prisoners of war received the mission to drop bacteriological bombs, their briefing officers also said that it was extremely secret. Even the people who dropped the bombs were not allowed to check the bacteriological bombs, and in order not to let more people in their own troops know the truth, it was stipulated that bacteriological bombs should be renamed "non-explosive bombs" when reporting. At the same time, these two prisoners of war dropped bacteriological bombs four times at night. This is also completely consistent with the situation discovered by the Korean and Chinese people, that is, American aircraft mostly spread bacteria at night and on cloudy days.

    Fourth, the bacteriological warfare conducted by the American aggressors was large-scale. As is well known, from January 28 to March 31 this year, according to incomplete statistics, U.S. aircraft spread bacteria, insects, and various poisons a total of 804 times in Korea alone. The areas where they were spread covered Korea and Northeast China, and even extended to Qingdao and other areas. Enoch and Quinn confessed that the American aggressors had long conducted bacteriological warfare training on a large scale for air force personnel, and the training sites included not only the United States, but also Gunsan in Korea and Iwakuni in Japan.

    Fifth, according to the confessions of Enoch and Quinn, the date when the American aggressors began to conduct large-scale bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people was not January 28, 1952, but January 1, or even earlier than that date.

    The facts are very clear, and the towering crime of the American aggressors in conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare against the Korean and Chinese people is already ironclad and undeniable.

    In addition to interrogating the two prisoners of war in detail about the process of dropping bacteriological bombs, the team also took photos and documentary films of the entire interrogation process, and recorded the confessions of the two prisoners of war, which can be made public to the people of the world. The U.S. government has repeatedly and insidiously attempted to slander the fact that it conducted bacteriological warfare as "natural epidemics in Korea and China." The above ironclad evidence thoroughly shattered all the shameless sophistry of the American aggressors.

    The American aggressors have seriously violated international law and humanitarian principles. We sincerely call on scientists and journalists from all countries, as well as all peace-loving people around the world, to unite and condemn the heinous crimes of the American aggressors, to judge the war criminals who instigated and carried out bacteriological warfare, in order to uphold human justice and defend world peace.

专栏：

    朝中专家、记者联合讯问团
    讯问伊纳克及奎恩两战俘报告书
    一  本团的缘起
    美国侵略者不顾国际公法和人道原则，疯狂地对朝中两国人民进行了细菌战。在全世界人民同声斥责和愤怒抗议之下，美国侵略者仍然毫无悔祸之心。他们一方面继续在朝中两国撒布细菌，一方面却卑鄙无耻地狡辩和抵赖它的这一万恶罪行，并恶毒地造谣污蔑朝中人民。美国侵略者的这一切诡辩和狡赖是完全徒劳的，朝中两国人民除已在朝鲜前线和后方及中国的东北等地收集到大量的人证和物证外，今年一月十三日，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在平壤西北的安州地区击落了美国侵朝军用飞机一架，俘掳了该机领航员凯尼斯·罗埃德·伊纳克（Kenneth    Lloyd    Enoch）和驾驶员约翰·赛莱斯·奎恩（John    Silas    Quinn）。该两战俘被俘以来，身受朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的宽大待遇，逐渐认识到自己所犯的严重罪行，供认了他们奉侵朝美国军事当局的命令，曾经在不同时间、不同地点先后在朝鲜投掷过数次细菌炸弹，这就对美国侵略者对朝中人民进行的细菌战的残暴行为提供了最有力的、不可辩驳的证据。朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会和中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，为了把这一事实向全世界人民公布，彻底揭穿美国政府的种种无耻谎言，共同发起组成了“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”，前往朝鲜某地战俘营讯问这两个美国空军俘虏。法国巴黎今晚报记者贝却敌也应邀参加了讯问团的工作。
    二  讯问的经过
    本团到达朝鲜某地某战俘营后，即分组地和全体地讯问伊纳克及奎恩两战俘，从五月一日起至五月八日止，共讯问六次。该两战俘向本团供认了他们被俘前后各自的历史，受细菌战训练经过和奉命投掷细菌弹的情况。
    伊纳克及奎恩是在今年一月十三日深夜同时被中国人民志愿军某部俘获的。
    一月十三日晚二十一点四十五分，他们奉令与轰炸手唐内士中尉（Lt.Dournes）机械师坎拜尔中士（Sgt.Camplell），一共四人，乘六○○号（注：美机编号一般是五个数字，但在美空军中提到飞机编号时，为便于记忆，只提五个数字的后三个，因此这六○○号是指××六○○号）B—26型轰炸机，自朝鲜南部群山基地起飞，轰炸安州。二十三点三十分到达目标上空，即遭朝中部队某部高射炮火击中。唐内士、坎拜尔当即毙命。奎恩及伊纳克先后跳伞落地，立刻被俘。
    伊纳克是美国空军中尉，军号AO—2069988，
    一九四三年一月中学毕业，一九四三年六月七日参加美国陆军航空队，一九四七年退伍，一九五○年美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，重新被召入伍。一九五一年八月十三日他被调到日本，九月一日被调到朝鲜群山空军基地，经编入美国空军第五航空队第三轻轰炸机联队第三轻轰炸机大队第八轰炸中队充当B—26型机领航员。伊纳克供认第三轻轰炸联队的司令官是欧门上校（Col.Ohman），第三轻轰炸机大队大队长是摩根上校（Col.Morgan），第八轰炸中队中队长是李埃中校（Lt.Col.Leahy）。
    奎恩是美国空军中尉，军号17993A，中学毕业后曾在海军大学肄业四年。一九四八年二月十六日参加美国空军。一九五一年八月二十五日被调到浮吉尼亚州兰格利基地学习驾驶B—26型机。十一月三十日被调到朝鲜群山基地，与伊纳克同属第八轰炸中队，充当B—26型机驾驶员。
    奎恩供认曾和伊纳克同机出动过五次。但在投细菌弹时，他们说从未同机。
    这两个战俘一致供认曾受过进行细菌战的秘密训练。伊纳克供认曾听过细菌战课三次，第一次听课时间是在一九五一年八月二十五日下午一时至三时，地点在日本岩国空军地面学校，讲课人是个叫威尔逊的（Wilson）的平民；后两次在去年十月及十二月，在朝鲜群山空军基地，讲课人是白朗宁少校（Maj.Browning）。奎恩供认曾在去年十二月十八日在群山空军基地听过细菌战课一次，讲课人是一个叫阿西福克（Ashfork）的平民。这两战俘都一致供认，讲课人在讲授时说明，听课人对于讲课内容必须严守秘密，不许向任何人泄露。为了保守秘密，细菌弹被称为“不爆炸的炸弹”。
    侵朝美军对于美国空军人员施行细菌战训练是大批进行的。据伊纳克供认，白朗宁少校所讲关于细菌战的课程“是经常举行的，每一个人都必须参加听课”。新的空军部队由于轮换而开到群山空军基地时，都举办这一课程，施行训练。据伊纳克供称与他一同于八月二十五日听威尔逊所讲那一堂关于细菌战的秘密课程的共有驾驶员十名，领航员十五名，其中驾驶员有F·莱麦克上尉（Capt.Frank    Lemark），G·白劳顿中尉（lst    Lt.GuyBroughton），E·斯密特中尉（lst    Lt.Eldon    Schmidt）；领航员中除他自己外，有K·卡生上尉（Capt.    Kenneth    Carson）、纳尔逊上尉（Capt.Nelson），C·格尔文中尉（lst    Lt.    Charls    Garvin）、E·哈地中尉（lst    Lt.    Emmett    Hardy）、R·戴古中尉
    （lst    Lt.    Roy    Dagaugh）、R·白朗中尉（lst    Lt.Ronald    Brown）、L·吉林斯基少尉（2nd    Lt.    LarryZielinski）、J·拉逊少尉（2nd    Lt.    John    Larson）等。据奎恩供称，一同听阿西福克所授关于细菌战秘密课程的有驾驶员C·兰德上尉（Capt.    CarryLand）、何瓦斯上尉（Capt.    Howarth）、史密德中尉（lst    Lt.    Schmidt）、罗伯逊上尉（Capt.Robertson）、皮生上尉（Capt.    Beason）、麦克阿立斯特中尉（lstLt.    Mcallister）、领航员：郎恩上尉（Capt.    Long）、达费上尉（Capt.    Francis    x.    Duffy）、拉荪少尉（2nd    Lt.    John    Larson）、史瓦兹中尉（lst    Lt.Schwartz）、W·华生中尉（lst    Lt.    WilliamWatson）、罗吉士中尉（lst    Lst.    Rogers）、罗伯兹少尉（2nd    Lt.    Robert    Robests）。
    据伊纳克供称，他初次听细菌战课是一九五一年八月二十五日。这日子是值得注意的，它证明侵朝美军至少在去年八月下旬已经开始进行大规模细菌战的训练，它对朝鲜人民以及朝中部队施行灭绝人性的滔天罪行是准备已久的。
    侵朝美军在朝鲜与中国东北进行细菌战的武器是多种多样的，它的方法是恶毒而阴险的。这一些从伊纳克与奎恩两战俘所供认的材料中已获得充分证明。据伊纳克供称，他在接受关于细菌战的训练时，讲课人威尔逊曾告以进行细菌战的各种武器，例如飞机上用喷撒装置，在空中喷撒带菌尘埃；在半空开启的细菌弹，它随风散布带菌尘埃；落地开启的细菌弹，内装带菌虫子；落地后裂开的纸制容器，内装带菌昆虫；带有降落伞的各式容器，内装带有带菌昆虫的小动物；带菌的传单、自来水笔、衣服与食物等；还有装有细菌的容器，投入江湖与蓄水池，使水污染，为害人畜。奎恩所供美国进行细菌战武器与方法大体与上述相同，但他供出四种不同装置的细菌弹，这些细菌弹的外形都类似普通五百磅的爆炸弹。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜与中国东北进行细菌战曾使用许多种为害人类的病菌。朝中双方以及调查过美国进行细菌战的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团都业已获得确证。这次美国空军战俘伊纳克与奎恩的自供更证实了这一点。据这两个战俘供认，讲授进行细菌战课程的威尔逊·白朗宁与阿西福克都详细说明过可用以进行细菌战的细菌、立克次氏体、病害和病原虫，如腺鼠疫、伤寒、霍乱、痢疾、斑疹伤寒、天花、黄热病、脑炎和疟疾。伊纳克供认威尔逊并提到如何使用“很多可怕的奇怪的和不常听到的细菌”。
    讲课人并在可用以带菌的昆虫方面，曾提到蝇、蚤、蚊、虱等许多昆虫。奎恩供认，授课人阿西福克曾说明“差不多任何虫子都可以用来传布细菌”，虫子“经过选择与培养可以耐寒，不吃东西也可以活得很长久。”“细菌可以借多种不同的昆虫和啮齿类的动物而传播，这些昆虫和啮齿类动物是在实验室的条件下培养了好几代，使他们在任何时候任何地点，即使在最不利的条件下都能生存而挑选出来的。”
    据两个战俘供认，细菌战课的讲课人告诉过他们，飞机在投掷细菌弹时要飞得比寻常投爆炸弹时低而慢，以便保护弹内带菌昆虫的生命。细菌战的讲课人并说明了细菌可能害及进行细菌战人员自己，所以也教授过预防细菌疾病的种种办法。
    两战俘还向本团详细供述了投掷细菌弹的经过情形：伊纳克曾出动投细菌弹二次，一次在一月七日，投在黄州，共投两个；另一次在一月十一日，投在中和，共投四个。奎恩也投过二次，第一次在一月四日，投在平壤东南，共四个；第二次在一月十一日，投在军隅里以北，共两个。这四次投弹，每一次的前后经过——他们出动前得到的秘密简令，登机前的特殊情况，投弹经过以及任务完毕归来的汇报，都毫无疑问地说明他们所投的是细菌弹。
    （一）秘密简令：伊纳克两次出动前，简令官在给他的命令中，都明确的告诉他去投的是细菌弹。
    在奎恩的两次出动前，简令官在给他的命令中，两次都用“不爆炸的炸弹”的名称来代替细菌弹。
    （二）登机前情况：伊纳克和奎恩的四次出动，在登机前每次都发现飞机旁边有卫兵并告诉他们机翼上的炸弹检查过了，禁止他们再去检查。在通常执行任务时，领航员照例该把所有炸弹检查一遍，从无例外。
    伊纳克及奎恩都注意到那机翼上带的细菌弹正如他们在受细菌战训练上课时听到的，外形很像普通五百磅爆炸弹。但是他们发现细菌弹上没有引爆信管。引爆信管在普通爆炸弹上是决不可少的。
    （三）投弹经过：简令官对伊纳克和奎恩，每次都命令他们在投细菌弹时低飞，高度不得超过五百英尺。他们依令执行。伊纳克出动的两次，飞机投细菌弹时都低飞到五百英尺；奎恩投弹时甚至低飞到二百英尺。结果投下的炸弹，正如简令官事先告诉他们的，都是“不爆炸的炸弹”。这样的高度决不是投普通五百磅爆炸弹的。投普通五百磅爆炸弹，最低的安全高度是约一千二百英尺以上。
    （四）汇报：出动回来，汇报任务，伊纳克和奎恩每次都照简令官预先关照的，把细菌弹说成“不爆炸的炸弹”。为了避免使他们内部更多人知道这投细菌弹的秘密，美国空军规定在汇报时以“不爆炸的炸弹”作为细菌弹的代号。
    伊纳克及奎恩四次投细菌弹的经过情况是类似的。为了使人们更明确了解上述四点，这里举伊纳克一月七日出动投细菌弹的详细经过为例。伊纳克这样供述：
    “出动前一天，即一月六日的下午二时，在群山空军基地，我和同机的驾驶员阿麦斯上尉（Capt.William    Amos）及机械士R．屈西军曹（Sgt.RichardTracy）到第三轰炸大队的简令室里去接受第二天出动的命令。大队的简令官是G．加莱上尉（Capt.Gilbert    Carey）。从一月六日夜晚到七日的清晨间，预定有二十四架飞机出动，每架一个小组，每小组三四人不等，都在室内。我们这一小组奉令在次晨三时起飞，到平壤及沙里院间被划为所谓‘第八号绿色轰炸航线’上执行任务。”
    “一月七日早二时，阿麦斯和我照例向大队作战官报到，看看命令有无改变。大队作战室的R．史第华上尉（Capt.Robert    Stuart）口头命令我们：我们飞机机翼外架上的两个炸弹是细菌弹，要投在黄州，投弹时飞机最高高度不得过五百英尺，最大速度每小时不得过二百英里，两个细菌弹已有人代为检查过了，我们不必再检查。细菌弹投下后，我们应该尽快的把其他炸弹投下，飞回基地汇报；汇报时这两个细菌弹就说成是‘不爆炸的炸弹’，好保证机密。”
    “史第华在发这样机密命令时，室内只有史第华本人、阿麦斯和我。其他小组的人都候在室外。这情况很特殊，因为在通常起飞前去接受简令时，室内往往同时有两三个小组。”
    “我们听完密令出来，同屈西走向我们那机号二四七（注：也是指机号最后三个字）的B—26型机。飞机旁边有个军械科派来的卫兵，告诉我们机翼上的炸弹已经检查过，毋需再检查。我就检查了机身上弹仓里的六个五百磅爆炸弹。B—36型机每一机翼上可带二弹，分装在外架及内架上，两翼一共可带四弹。我注意到装在外架上两个细菌弹，和旁边内架上装的普通五百磅爆炸弹，在外形上极像。不过细菌弹上没有普通炸弹上的引爆信管。”
    “这样派卫兵来守卫装有细菌弹的飞机，在执行普通轰炸任务时，从来没有发生过。我们以往总是在起飞前把炸弹都检查一遍的。”
    “我们准时三点从群山起飞，按预定航线，先向西到延坪岛上空，由那里经海州北飞。飞机在七千五百英尺上空飞行，沿途未遇高射炮火。将近沙里院时，飞机低飞到约五百英尺，迳飞离沙里院约十英里的黄州。当飞机飞到黄州以西约四分之一或五分之一英里时，驾驶员按驾驶杆上的电钮，投下两个细菌弹。两弹落入黄州，着地都未爆炸。我在纪录上注明这两个‘不爆炸的炸弹’。飞机投弹时平飞。飞行高度约五百英尺，速度每小时二百英里。按通常情况，在投五百磅爆炸弹时，飞机最低高度是约一千二百英尺，如果再低，那炸弹爆炸时就要危及飞机。”
    “两细菌弹投毕，飞机升高到一千五百英尺，飞到黄州以北五英里公路上空，驾驶员将其余八个五百磅炸弹接连投下，随即回飞到南浦附近的大同江及海?交叉口，由那里直飞延坪岛返群山。在群山是早上五时。”“任务完成回来，汇报情况，我们除降落时却报告一般情况外，把那两个投在黄州的细菌弹报成‘不爆炸的炸弹’。”
    照两俘供认，美机开始投细菌弹的时间，最晚也在今年一月一日。伊纳克供出他在一月一日曾奉命出动投细菌弹，临时因患感冒由别人替代了。奎恩说在去年十二月三十一日，他听到大队作战官传达命令，从那时开始，大家在汇报时一定要把所有
    “不爆炸的炸弹”报上，美国侵略者进行的细菌战是大规模的，它久已在大批空军人员中，进行细菌战训练。投过细菌弹的美国空军人员是很多的。即使他们内部严格规定保守秘密，但以伊纳克和奎恩所属第八轰炸中队来说，奎恩就知道至少还有上文中提到的史密德中尉、拉逊少尉和达费上尉。拉逊曾告诉奎恩：他在一月四日晚曾到平壤东南投了四个细菌弹，史密德说他曾在军隅里东北投了四个细菌弹；达费也对奎恩讲他在一月五日晚上，在平壤东南投了细菌弹。
    三  结论
    根据以上事实，我们得出如下结论：
    第一、美国侵略者对朝中人民进行细菌战是完全确凿的事实。提供上述证据的不是别人，而是遵照美国军事当局的命令，亲自数次在朝鲜投掷细菌弹的美国空军人员伊纳克和奎恩。这是惯于撒谎和抵赖的美国军政首脑人物及其宣传机关无法否认的，也是根本不能否认的事实。
    第二、美国侵略者对朝中人民进行细菌战是经过长期的周密的准备，是完全有计划的行动。早在一九五○年末，美国侵略者从朝鲜北部溃逃时，就曾撒布过病菌。在这次对朝中人民发动大规模细菌战之前，至少在一九五一年八月二十五日，它们就已经开始对美国侵朝空军人员进行了细菌战的训练。训练的内容十分广泛而且周到，举凡细菌的武器种类和构造，撒布细菌的容器和方法，投掷细菌弹时应该注意的事项，以及万一疫病流传到自己的军队和地区时如何进行预防等，都在讲授之列。这就说明美国侵略者的这一野蛮残暴的犯罪行为是蓄谋已久的，早就准备好了的。
    第三、美国侵略者妄图用细菌武器杀害朝中人民是在极端的秘密情况下进行的。为了掩盖这一凶恶残暴的犯罪行为，美国细菌战的讲课人曾经一再告诉听课人这门课的内容是极端秘密的，即使在美国空军人员中也不能随便谈论。该两战俘在接受投掷细菌弹的任务时，他们的简令官也说，这是极端秘密的。连投弹的人也不准检查细菌弹，为了不使它自己部队内有更多的人知道真情，并且规定在汇报时将细菌弹改称“不爆炸的炸弹”。同时，这两个战俘四次投掷细菌弹都是在深夜进行的。这和朝中两国人民已经发现的，即美国飞机多在黑夜和阴天撒布细菌的情况，也是完全符合的。
    第四、美国侵略者进行细菌战是大规模的。众所周知，从今年一月二十八日起至三月三十一日止，据不完全统计，美国飞机单在朝鲜境内撒布的细菌昆虫及各种毒物就有八百零四次。撒布的地区遍及朝鲜和中国的东北，甚至扩大到青岛及其他区域。伊纳克及奎恩供认，美国侵略者很久就对空军人员大批的进行细菌战的训练，训练地点不仅在美国，还包括朝鲜的群山及日本的岩国等地。
    第五、根据伊纳克和奎恩的口供证明，美国侵略者开始对朝中人民大规模地进行细菌战的日期，不是一九五二年一月二十八日，而是一月一日，甚至比这个日子还要早。
    事实十分明白，美国侵略者对朝中人民大规模地进行细菌战的滔天罪行，已经是铁证如山，不可抵赖的。
    本团除详细地讯问了两个战俘投掷细菌弹的经过外，并将讯问的全部过程拍摄了照片和纪录电影，对该两战俘的口供，也进行了录音，即可公诸于全世界人民的面前。美国政府曾一再阴险狠毒地企图将其进行细菌战的事实诬蔑为“朝鲜和中国的天然瘟疫”。上述铁的证据，彻底地粉碎了美国侵略者
    一切无耻的狡辩。
    美国侵略者已经严重地违犯了国际公法和人道原则。我们诚恳地呼吁各国的科学家和新闻同业们，以及全世界一切爱好和平的人们，一致行动起来，声讨美国侵略者的万恶罪行，裁判主使、执行细菌战的战争罪犯，以维护人类正义，保卫世界和平。
