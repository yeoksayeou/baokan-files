    Village Cadres in Chechang Village, Laishui County, Hebei Province,
    Illegally Confiscate Widow Lin Jiling's Property
    Editor: I am a widow from Chechang Village, Laishui County, Hebei Province. Chechang Village cadres Wang Kerang, Dong Xipu, and others tried to get me to marry a cadre, but I didn't agree because I had my own partner. They used various methods to sabotage our relationship. They threatened me, claiming that if I married someone in the village, I could take my house and land to the man's family; but if I married someone from another village, I couldn't take anything. Now, I have married Ju Ruilin from another village (Lou Village, Laishui County, eight li from Chechang Village). However, the Chechang Village cadres have actually confiscated my four mu of land and the house I live in. I remember that the Marriage Law stipulates that when a widow remarries, her property can be taken to her husband's home. I request that the relevant departments resolve my problem. Lin Jiling

    河北省涞水县车厂村干部
    竟违法没收寡妇林纪龄的财物
    编辑同志：我是河北省涞水县车厂村的一个寡妇。车厂村干部王克让、董夕璞等企图要我和一个干部结婚，我不同意。因为我有自己的对象。他们用种种方法破坏我们的事情。他们威吓我，扬言如果我嫁在本村，我的房子、土地可以带到男家去；如果我嫁到外村，什么东西都不能带走。现在，我是和外村（涞水县娄村，距车厂村八里路）的鞠瑞麟结婚了。但是，车厂村干部真把我的四亩地和我住的房子都没收了。我记得婚姻法上规定，寡妇再结婚时，属于寡妇的财产是可以带到男家去的。我请求有关部门解决我的问题。　林纪龄
