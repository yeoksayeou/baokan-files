Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. The Indonesian Muslim Trade Union Delegation, led by Chairman Kacha, consisting of three members, who were invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to come to our country to attend the "May Day" celebrations, arrived in Guangzhou by train today. The delay was due to the British government in Hong Kong obstructing the signing of their transit visas. Those who went to the station to welcome them included: Lin Qiangyun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Huang Minwei, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Chen Nengxing, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Wu Jiemin, Minister of Culture and Education of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and others.
