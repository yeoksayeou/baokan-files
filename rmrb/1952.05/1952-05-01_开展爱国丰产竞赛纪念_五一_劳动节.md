　　Launch a Patriotic Production Increase Campaign to Commemorate May Day
　　Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda
　　The great festival of the working people of the world—May Day—is coming. While we are happily commemorating this festival, we are also angrily condemning the US imperialists for carrying out a sinful germ warfare against our Chinese and Korean people. In order to defend world peace, defend production, and defend the happy times of the working people, I hope that all farmers in the country will unite more closely, launch a patriotic production increase campaign, and use practical work achievements to commemorate our own festival. Our agricultural producers' cooperative is willing to work with agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and all working farmers across the country to do the following:

　　We must learn the collectivism and organization of the working class, develop mutual labor assistance, overcome drought, flood, pests, and diseases, and sow in a timely manner to do a good job in the first step of increasing yield per unit area. From my personal experience of the past nine years, I have determined that by following the path of "organizing ourselves" as instructed by Chairman Mao, our farmers can forever get rid of poverty and move towards a happy life. Like our Xigou Village, after nine years of cooperation and mutual assistance, the "poor mountain gully" has begun to turn into a rich mountain gully. This year, in addition to concentrating our efforts on increasing yield per unit area, we must also consider long-term construction, implement cooperative afforestation and develop animal husbandry, so that our mountain gully will gradually become a happy paradise. I hope that farmers across the country will actively participate in mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives, work hard in production, and launch a patriotic production increase campaign that is more extensive than last year.

　　We must learn all high-yield experiences. In last year's patriotic production increase campaign, many new high-yield records appeared in various parts of our country, which is inseparable from organizing and improving farming techniques. Therefore, in this year's production increase competition, we should accept the advanced agricultural science knowledge and technical management experience of the Soviet Union; we should also learn the good methods of advanced agricultural producers in various parts of our country, and flexibly apply these valuable experiences to production according to our specific conditions to ensure that we can create more and higher high-yield records this year and generally increase yield per unit area.

　　We must consolidate the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, and more forcefully support the Chinese People's Volunteers to eliminate the germ warfare manufactured by US imperialism. To this end, in addition to concentrating our efforts on launching a patriotic production increase campaign, we must also pay attention to doing a good job in giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and代耕 (tilling the land for others), first cultivating and planting the land of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and ensuring increased yields.

### 开展爱国丰产竞赛纪念“五一”劳动节

　　开展爱国丰产竞赛纪念“五一”劳动节
    农业劳动模范李顺达
    全世界劳动人民的伟大的节日——“五一”劳动节来到了，我们一面高兴地来纪念这个节日，一面又愤慨地痛恨美帝国主义对我们中朝人民实行罪恶的细菌战。为了保卫世界和平，保卫生产，保卫劳动人民的幸福的时光，我希望全国农民同胞更紧密地团结起来，展开爱国增产竞赛运动，用实际工作成绩来纪念我们自己的节日。我们的农业生产合作社愿同全国各地的农业生产合作社、互助组和全体劳动农民在一起做好下面几件事：
    我们要学习工人阶级的集体性组织性，发展劳动互助，战胜旱涝病虫灾害，适时地进行播种，做好提高单位面积产量的第一步工作。我从九年来的亲身体验里认定了，照着毛主席指示的“组织起来”的道路前进，我们农民就能永远摆脱穷困走向幸福的生活。像我们西沟村，经过九年来的合作互助，已使“穷山沟”开始变成富山沟了。今年我们除集中力量提高单位面积产量外，还要为长期建设着想，实行合作造林和发展牧畜业，使我们的山沟逐渐变成一个幸福的乐园。我希望全国农民都积极参加互助组或农业生产合作社，努力生产，开展一个比去年更加广泛的爱国丰产竞赛运动。
    我们要学习一切丰产经验。在去年的爱国丰产运动里面，我国各地出现了许多丰产新纪录，这是和组织起来改进耕作技术分不开的。因此，在今年的增产竞赛运动中间，我们应该接受苏联先进的农业科学知识和技术管理经验；也应该学习我国各地先进的农业生产者的好办法，并且根据各自的具体情况，把这些宝贵的经验灵活地用到生产上，保证今年能够创造更多更高的丰产纪录，普遍地提高单位面积产量。
    我们要在工人阶级的领导下巩固工农联盟，更有力地支援中国人民志愿军，消灭美帝国主义制造的细菌战。为了这，我们除集中力量开展爱国丰产竞赛运动外，还要注意做好优待烈属军属和代耕工作，把革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的土地，先耕好种好，并且要保证提高产量。（附图片）
