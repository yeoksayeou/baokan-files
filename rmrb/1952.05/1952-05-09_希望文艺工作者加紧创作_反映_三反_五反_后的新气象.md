    Hope Literary and Art Workers Intensify Creation to Reflect the New Atmosphere After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Campaigns

    Comrade Editor: The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, launched nationwide, have achieved brilliant victories. A brand-new atmosphere has emerged in every corner of the motherland, providing excellent material for literary and art creation. For example, the sketch published on page three of the People's Daily on April 30, "Lowering Commodity Prices - One of the Gains of the 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' Movements" (by Gu Qun and Liang Yulong), is a very timely artwork. The gains of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements are multifaceted. It is hoped that literary and art workers, who are engaged in this fierce struggle, can use various art forms to vividly and concretely publicize and educate the people about the various new atmospheres brought about by the victory of the struggle, so as to consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements.

    希望文艺工作者加紧创作
    反映“三反”“五反”后的新气象
    编辑同志：在全国范围内开展的“三反”和“五反”运动，已经取得了辉煌的胜利。祖国的每一角落，都出现了崭新的气象，给文艺工作者提供了极好的创作材料。像四月三十日人民日报第三版发表速写的：“降低商品牌价——‘三反’‘五反’运动的收获之一”（顾群、梁玉龙作）就是一幅很适时的美术作品。“三反”“五反”运动的收获是多方面的，希望投身于这一激烈斗争的文艺工作者们，能够通过各种文艺形式，把斗争胜利所带来的各种新气象，生动具体地向人民进行宣传教育，以巩固
    “三反”和“五反”运动的胜利成果。  岑风
