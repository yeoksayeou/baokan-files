    The Entire Cast of the Shanxi Pu Opera Experimental Theater
    Help the Masses Catch Wheat Aphids and Are Welcomed
    Comrade Editor: In early April, 360,000 mu of wheat fields in Yishi County, southern Shanxi, were suddenly infested with large numbers of wheat aphids. The People's Government promptly organized more than 80,000 young men and women militia members and students to help the farmers eradicate them. In less than six days, more than 56,000 catties of wheat aphids were captured and destroyed. During the intense phase of catching insects, all 74 actors of the Shanxi Pu Opera Experimental Theater also came to help the farmers exterminate the aphids. When this long line of blue-uniformed figures appeared in the Emeilingwa wheat fields, the farmers and students who were working all cheered loudly. Famous actors "Little Fenglan" and "Yu Yuexian," although sweating and panting while exterminating the wheat aphids, were unwilling to fall behind. Old farmer Yan Haihua, who had been a hired hand for 34 years, said, "Everything has become better in the years under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the actors have also changed, they have changed!" In this insect-catching campaign, the actors deeply experienced the enthusiasm and strength of the masses, and realized that they must integrate themselves with the lives of the masses in order to make their performances more authentic and vivid.　Fan Yiwu

    山西蒲剧实验剧院全体演员
    帮助群众捕麦蚜受到欢迎
    编辑同志：四月初，晋南猗氏县有三十六万亩小麦地突然遭受大批麦蚜侵害。人民政府及时组织八万多青年男女民兵、学生们帮助农民扑灭，不到六天时间，就捕灭麦蚜五万六千多斤。在捕虫的紧张阶段，山西蒲剧实验剧院全体演员七十四人，也来帮助农民灭蚜。当峨嵋岭洼麦地上出现这一长列穿蓝制服的队伍时，正在工作的农民和学生们，都高声欢呼起来。名演员“小凤兰”“月月鲜”，在扑灭麦蚜的时候，虽然流汗喘气，也不愿落后。曾经当过三十四年雇工的老农民阎海花说：“毛主席领导的年头什么都变好了，演员也变了，变了！”演员们在这次捕虫运动中，深深体验到群众的热情和力量，觉悟到必须和群众生活打成一片，才能使自己的演出更真实更生动。　范一悟
