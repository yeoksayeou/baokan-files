To cultivate children's interest in science, first of all, we must cultivate children's love for the motherland and for the working people. Only those who possess this kind of love can selflessly delve into science, use scientific achievements to develop the motherland's productive capacity, and raise cultural standards, thereby contributing those valuable achievements to all mankind and enriching their lives. Only in this way can the noble qualities of children in a society led by the proletariat be fully developed. These lofty qualities cannot be fully understood by those engaged in children's education in bourgeois society.

Science is like a weapon in war against nature. To conquer nature, we must master this scientific weapon. The great Soviet biologist Michurin said: "We cannot wait for nature to bestow gifts, we must seize them from it." In order to make nature more obedient to the will of mankind, we must proceed from understanding nature to transforming nature, and science must play a role in this process.

Children should be made aware of the greatness of nature from a very young age. Family and school education should cultivate children's interest in nature and their desire to transform it. When children are curious and seeking knowledge of the natural world, they should be guided. Games and toys should be used to develop children's understanding of nature and their creative demands. For example, construction games can cultivate thinking and imagination; sand and soil games can initially develop the desire and aspiration to transform the world; the creation of airplane models can increase children's interest in aviation machinery; and gardening labor, trips in nature, and visits to factories can all cultivate children's love for nature, love for the motherland, and interest in science. Many children have the desire to become scientists when they are young, which is good, but it must be cultivated well. We scientific workers should help schools cultivate children's interest in science, such as meeting with children, telling them stories of scientific inventions and new scientific achievements, and helping children conduct scientific experiments and creative activities.

Children in New China are fully capable of developing their talents in science. To achieve scientific success, we must work even harder and more resolutely. The lifelong struggles of the great Soviet biologist Michurin and the great physiologist Pavlov provide excellent examples of this necessary perseverance. The deeds and great ideals of the great proletarian teachers Marx, Engels, and Lenin shine even more brilliantly on the bright future of our children. I cheer for the happy children of New China.

    如何培养儿童对科学的兴趣
    李四光
    要培养儿童对科学的兴趣，首先要培养儿童对祖国，对劳动人民的热爱。也只有具有这种热爱的人，才能无私地去钻研科学，用科学的成就来发展祖国的生产能力，提高文化水平，从而把那些宝贵的成就贡献给全体人类，丰富他们的生活。这样才能充分地发挥无产阶级领导的社会中儿童的高贵品质。这种崇高的品质，不是资产阶级社会中从事儿童教育的人们所能彻底了解的。
    科学对于自然犹如战争中的武器。要想战胜自然，我们必须掌握这种科学的武器。苏联伟大的生物学家米丘林说：“我们不能等待大自然的赐与，我们要向他夺取。”为着使自然更驯服于人类的意志，我们必须从认识自然进到改造自然，而科学就必须在这样的过程中发挥作用。
    应当使儿童从很幼小的时候起，就注意到自然的伟大。家庭和学校的教育应该培养儿童对自然的兴趣和改造自然的愿望。在儿童好奇探求自然界知识的时候，应该加以诱导，应当利用游戏和玩具来发展儿童对于自然的认识和创作的要求。譬如建筑的游戏，可以培养思考和想像力；沙土的游戏，可以初步的发展改造世界的要求和愿望；飞机模型的创造，可以增加儿童对于航空机械的兴趣；而庭园种植花卉的劳动，大自然中的旅行，工厂的参观，都可以培养儿童对于大自然的爱，对于祖国的爱，对于科学的兴趣。有许多儿童从小就有将来做科学家的愿望，这是好的，但必须好好地培养。我们科学工作者们，应该帮助学校培养儿童对科学的兴趣。譬如与儿童会见，给他们讲科学发明的故事与新的科学成就，帮助儿童进行科学的实验和创造活动等。
    新中国的儿童，是完全有条件在科学上发展自己的才能的。为了获得科学的成就，我们还须更艰苦和更坚决的努力。苏联的伟大生物学家米丘林，伟大的生理学家巴甫洛夫一生的奋斗，对于这种必须的毅力，就提供了很好的榜样。伟大的无产阶级导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁的一生奋斗的事迹和伟大的理想，更辉煌地照耀着我们儿童们光辉灿烂的前途，我为新中国幸福的儿童们欢呼。
