Economic Briefs

    ▲ To support the large-scale patriotic production increase campaign, cooperatives at all levels in Henan Province are actively supplying farmers with agricultural tools. According to incomplete statistics from cooperatives in Xinyang, Shangqiu, Luoyang, and two other special districts, more than 360,000 jin of iron farm tools have been processed and produced; most areas have now begun lending or selling them. The Nanyang Special District Cooperative processed more than 90,000 pieces of agricultural tools, most of which have been sold locally. Due to unified processing, the cost of goods has been reduced, and the prices of agricultural tools at the cooperatives are generally more than 10% lower than market prices.

    ▲ By mid-April, the People's Bank of Chahar Province had issued a total of more than 137 billion yuan in various loans to support farmers in improving agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, the loans used for water conservancy have helped farmers dig more than 17,700 water wells, build 138 irrigation canals, and repair 192 flood control dams, which are estimated to expand the cultivated area of paddy fields by more than 150,000 mu. In addition, 1.3 billion yuan was used to build a large-scale water conservancy project. Loans used to support the manufacture of agricultural tools have resulted in the production of more than 7,400 waterwheels and 10,000 new-style walking plows. Loans used to assist supply and marketing cooperatives in purchasing fertilizers have resulted in the purchase of more than 35.5 million jin of sesame cakes, soybean cakes, and fertilizer powder. Furthermore, the loans have helped farmers purchase more than 13,700 head of draught animals and more than 13,400 sheep.

    ▲ Credit cooperatives in Huangshan, Huguan County, and Yubei, Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, are actively helping the masses solve the difficulties of spring plowing and sowing. After absorbing more than 58,000 jin of stored grain, the Huangshan Credit Cooperative quickly put it into production. In March, it loaned 2,600 jin of grain and 2.35 million yuan, helping farmers purchase 13 head of livestock, 285 pieces of agricultural tools, and more than 100,000 jin of fertilizer. The Yubei Credit Cooperative loaned more than 76,000 jin of grain, helping farmers open four new irrigation canals, build more than 170 water storage ponds, buy 34 head of livestock, and buy 161 pieces of agricultural tools. The cooperative also plans to absorb 500,000 jin of stored grain in the second quarter to help the masses overcome the difficulties of sowing.
