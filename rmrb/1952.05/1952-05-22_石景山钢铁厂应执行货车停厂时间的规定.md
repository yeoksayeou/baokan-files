    Shijingshan Steel Plant Should Enforce Regulations on Freight Car Detention Time
    Editor: On January 11th, I received a notice from the Tianjin Railway Administration stating: "It is hereby verified that the freight car detention time for Shijingshan Steel Plant is changed from eight hours to six hours, effective January 15th." Based on this instruction, we contacted the steel plant, but the plant insisted on not accepting the six-hour regulation. We inquired with the Business Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration about this, and they replied by telegram stating: "Execute according to the original instructions. If the plant violates the regulations, overdue freight car fees can be collected according to regulations." In fact, Shijingshan Steel Plant does not accept this regulation at all, let alone pay overdue fees. We have reported the situation to the Tianjin Railway Administration and its affiliated Beijing Branch several times, but it has not attracted their attention. On this issue, both Shijingshan Steel Plant and Tianjin Railway Administration have demonstrated an irresponsible attitude. For four months, we have not only accumulated overdue fees, but also caused the state to suffer losses of more than ten billion yuan due to the extended freight car turnaround rate. This has also greatly affected the production morale of our station's employees. We suggest that leading cadres at all levels of the Central Ministry of Railways, Tianjin Railway Administration, the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, and Shijingshan Steel Plant should quickly resolve this four-month-long pending case.

### 石景山钢铁厂应执行货车停厂时间的规定

    石景山钢铁厂应执行货车停厂时间的规定
    编辑同志：我站在一月十一日接到天津铁路管理局的通知说：“今核定石景山钢铁厂的货车停厂时间由八小时改为六小时，自一月十五日起实行。”我们根据这一指示向钢铁厂接洽，但厂方坚持不接受六小时的规定。我们为此请示天津铁路管理局商务处，该处回电称：“按照原定指示执行。如厂方违反规定，可照章核收货车延期费。”事实上，石景山钢铁厂根本不接受这个规定，更不用谈支付延期费了。我们又向天津铁路管理局和所属北京分局数次反映情况，都没有引起他们的注意。在这个问题上，石景山钢铁厂和天津铁路管理局都表现了不负责任的作风。四个月来，我们不只积压了延期费，而且由于货车周转率的延长，使国家遭受了十多亿元的损失。这也大大影响了我站职工的生产情绪。我们建议，中央铁道部、天津铁路管理局、中央重
    工业部钢铁工业局、石景山钢铁厂各级领导干部，应迅速处理这个拖延四个月之久的悬案。
