    Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project 60 Percent Complete
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Changjiang Daily, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project was 60 percent complete as of May 21st. Reinforcement of the Jingjiang Dike is 79.3 percent complete. Currently, the gate installation work for the Taipingkou floodgate of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has begun. The Jingjiang Flood Diversion worksite has experienced continuous cloudy and rainy weather, and river water levels are rising. Under the slogan of "Seizing time, overcoming difficulties," 300,000 military personnel and civilian workers continue to enthusiastically promote the labor emulation campaign. The rush construction of the Hudukou River dam on the southern line was successfully closed on the afternoon of the 22nd. Workers and military personnel pouring concrete for the North Gate took advantage of the rare sunny day on the 22nd to work day and night, pouring nearly 4,000 cubic meters of concrete in one day. Military personnel and civilian workers digging, carrying, and transporting earth persevered in their labor despite the rain. As of the 21st, the North Gate project was 61 percent complete, the South Gate project was 42.5 percent complete, and the South Line dike construction was 71.8 percent complete. Based on labor input, the entire flood diversion project is 60 percent complete.
    On the 21st, the North Gate Command held a gate installation ceremony in front of the gate foundation, marking the beginning of a new stage in the gate construction project – gate installation work. In the preparatory work for the gate installation, workers and technicians overcame many difficulties, and new inventions and innovations continued to emerge. Before the steel supports and anchor bolts were delivered from Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Company, the workers came up with a method of using wooden models to replace the steel supports and used semicircular iron pieces nailed to the center of the wooden supports to replace calipers for alignment, which improved work efficiency threefold. Riveters are riveting twice as efficiently as in the factory. They are working day and night, and the construction site is filled with the rapid pounding of hammers and pneumatic riveting machines. Currently, the gate panel for the 29th bay is about to be installed, and the support arm for the 30th bay has been installed and will soon be put into operation using an assembly line method, starting work on three bays simultaneously each day.
    Workers at the Hengyang Railway Bureau, who undertook the manufacture of the South Gate for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, fully utilized their patriotic labor enthusiasm to support the progress of the flood diversion project. They completed the manufacture of 32 sets of gates sixteen days ahead of schedule on May 19th. The 32 sets of gate projects began on April 9th. Under the continuous education of the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union, the workers and technicians completed five sets of gates seven days ahead of schedule on April 28th as a gift for May Day. Starting on May 9th, they manufactured the last batch of gates. The workers enthusiastically responded to the call of "Racing against the flood, fully supporting the peasants," and spent only ten days completing all the gates. Every worker and technician participating in the manufacturing project seriously studied their work, and examples of creation and improvement continued to emerge. Each set of gates has more than two hundred kinds of large and small parts, which must go through many heavy and precise production processes. For example, turning a large steel sleeve weighing 186 kilograms is very heavy work. Initially, six lathes could only turn an average of four per day. After continuous research by the workers, the working method was changed three times, and a three-shift system and assembly line method were adopted. As long as five lathes are running, eight large steel sleeves can be turned out in one day. The workers and technicians improved and newly made a total of more than forty kinds of tools in forty-two days. The manufactured gates have now been transported to the construction site in batches, and the workers have also gone to the construction site by boat to carry out the final installation work.

### 荆江分洪工程完成百分之六十

    荆江分洪工程完成百分之六十
    【本报讯】据长江日报报道：荆江分洪工程到五月二十一日止，已完成百分之六十。荆江大堤加固工程完成百分之七十九点三。目前，荆江分洪太平口进洪闸建闸工程的闸门安装工作正开始。荆江分洪工地连日阴雨，江河水位上涨。三十万军工、民工在“争取时间，战胜困难”的口号下，继续热烈推进劳动竞赛运动。南线虎渡河拦河坝突击工程已于二十二日下午胜利合龙。北闸浇灌混凝土的工人和军工们，趁二十二日难得的晴天，昼夜突击，一天就浇灌了近四千公方混凝土。挖土、挑土、搬运的军工、民工们，冒雨坚持劳动。到二十一日止，北闸工程完成了百分之六十一，南闸工程完成了百分之四十二点五，南线堤工完成百分之七十一点八。按工数计算，整个分洪工程完成了百分之六十。
    二十一日，北闸指挥部在闸基面前举行了安装闸门典礼，建闸工程中一个新的阶段——安装闸门工作宣告开始。在安装闸门的准备工作中，工人与技术人员们克服了很多困难，新的发明创造不断出现。江汉船舶机械公司在钢制支座和地脚螺栓未运到以前，工人们想出以木制模型代替钢制支座的办法，并以半圆铁片钉在木制支座的轴心代替卡钳定线，这样就提高了工作效率三倍。铆钉工人钉铆钉比在工厂提高功效两倍，他们正在日夜赶工，工地上一片打锤和风铆机急促的敲击声。现在第二十九孔闸门门板即将安好，第三十孔闸门支臂已安装妥当，并且即将采取流水作业法按每日三孔同时开工。
    承制荆江分洪南闸闸门工程的衡阳铁路局工人，充分发挥爱国主义劳动热情，支援分洪工程的进展。他们在五月十九日提前十六天完成了三十二套闸门的制造任务。这三十二套闸门工程，从四月九日开始进行，工人和技术人员在党、团、工会的不断教    育下，在四月二十八日，提前七天完成了五套闸门，作为五一节的献礼。五月九日起，制造最后一批闸门，工人们热情响应“向洪水赛跑，全力支援农民”的号召，只花了十天时间，就把全部闸门完全赶制出来了。参加制造工程的每一个工人和技术人员，都认真钻研工作，创造改进的事例不断涌现。每套闸门都有二百多种大、小配件，要经过许多繁重、精细的生产过程。如镟一百八十六公斤一个的大钢套，工作十分繁重，开头转动六部车床，平均每天只能镟到四个，经过工人们不断研究，改了三次工作方法，采用了三班制和流水作业法，只要开动五部车床，一天就能镟出八个大钢套。工人和技术人员，在四十二天内就一共改进和新制了四十多种工具。现在已经制造好的闸门，已经分批运到工地，工人们也随船赴工地进行最后的安装工作。
