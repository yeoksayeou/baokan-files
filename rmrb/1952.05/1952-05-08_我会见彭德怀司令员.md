    I Meet Commander Peng Dehuai
    Li Dequan, Head of the "Investigation Group on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism"
    On March 23rd, our group arrived in Korea. During our comprehensive investigation into the crimes of bacteriological warfare by U.S. imperialism, the Deputy Head of our group, Mr. Liao Chengzhi, the Secretary-General of our group, Mr. Gong Naiquan, and I, on behalf of all comrades in our group, paid a visit to General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    As we warmly shook hands with Commander Peng, before I could express my intentions, he first thanked me for the people of the motherland organizing an investigation group to come to the front lines to investigate the crimes of bacteriological warfare committed by U.S. imperialism. He said, "The arrival of the investigation group fully demonstrates the deep concern of the people of the motherland for the Korean War." He then excitedly said, "This is a concrete manifestation of our unparalleled strength and victory."
    When I mentioned that the investigation group had come to Korea and witnessed various evidence of U.S. imperialism spreading bacteria-carrying insects, he pointed out firmly and angrily, "The enemy's crime is not accidental." He used various facts to prove that the American aggressors had been actively preparing for bacteriological warfare as early as the Second World War. He also said, "Last January, the Japanese bacteriological warfare criminal Shiro Ishii came to Seoul to prepare for the realization of this inhumane and shameful conspiracy in Korea."
    But why did the enemy use bacteriological weapons precisely at this time? Commander Peng pointed out, after analyzing in detail the changes in the Korean war situation: "The facts are so clear. The enemy originally boasted that airplanes and artillery were omnipotent and wanted to conquer North Korea with military force, and then attack Northeast China. After more than a year of war, the enemy's plan was completely shattered, and they were forced to conduct Korean armistice talks. During the negotiations, the enemy carried out the so-called 'Autumn Offensive,' which also failed. After all the enemy's shameful acts were heavily struck by the Chinese and Korean people's forces, they carried out large-scale bacteriological warfare in Korea, attempting to threaten the Korean people and the Chinese and Korean troops." Commander Peng Dehuai solemnly said: "I want to solemnly tell the enemy: Your attempt to intimidate the Chinese and Korean people and conquer the strong fighting will of the Chinese and Korean People's Army with what you consider 'significant' bacteriological warfare is a dead end. Your wishful thinking will certainly lead to undesired results under the righteous condemnation of the people of the world!"
    Yes, as Commander Peng said, the enemy's bacteriological warfare not only does not bring any military advantages, but on the contrary, it is a great political failure. As a result, the people of the world have become more clearly aware of the extremely barbaric and hideous face of the American aggressors, and it has further angered the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. Commander Peng solemnly stated, "The people and the people's army who fight for justice and peace will not be intimidated by these ambitious people." He talked about various conditions for defeating the enemy's bacteriological warfare and the experience in epidemic prevention over the past few dozens of days, which filled me with boundless confidence in defeating the enemy's bacteriological warfare.
    However, from what we have seen in our investigation, the scale of the enemy's bacteriological warfare this time is very large. If we do not mobilize the greatest strength and unite with all peace-loving people in the world to condemn and stop the crimes of the American aggressors, the enemy may expand bacteriological warfare to every piece of land on the earth, which will bring greater disasters to mankind. Therefore, Commander Peng told me in a very concerned tone to tell the people of the motherland, especially the people in the coastal provinces and Northeast China, to pay more attention to raising vigilance; and asked me to tell the people of the motherland and appeal to the people of the world to unite together and help the Korean people who are fighting against the enemy's airplanes, artillery, and bacteriological weapons for the independence of their country and the peace of the world, and to strive to put out the flames of aggression of U.S. imperialism as soon as possible.
    Finally, Commander Peng once again welcomed and thanked the investigation group for coming to Korea. He said, "Your work has further encouraged the firm confidence of the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army in anti-bacteriological warfare." He also thanked the experts who volunteered to come to Korea from the motherland. He optimistically compared the enemy's current difficulties with our increasingly powerful strength, and then said in a heavier tone: "Victory is ours, and it must be ours!"
    After ending the above conversation, we also talked about the situation of the female soldiers of the People's Volunteer Army. General Peng said with satisfaction, "Among the six thousand female comrades, eight hundred are meritorious, and most of them are meritorious medical workers." This means that they will become an important new force on the anti-bacteriological warfare front. Here, I express my respect to these female soldiers and heroines.
    Today, when I return to the motherland, in addition to compiling a report on the evidence of bacteriological warfare by U.S. imperialism collected by the whole group and publishing it to the people of the whole country and the world to condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism, I must express to the people of the whole country my conversation with Commander Peng. Through this conversation, I have improved my understanding of the bacteriological warfare conducted by U.S. imperialism. Now, with great enthusiasm, I appeal to the people of the motherland and all friends with a sense of humanity in the world, hoping that you will urgently mobilize to stop the heinous crime of the U.S. imperialists who violate humanity, exterminate humanity, and are absolutely prohibited by international law, and ask you to intensify assistance in all aspects to the Korean people who are fighting for national independence and world peace, and to strive to extinguish the flames of aggression of U.S. imperialism as soon as possible.

### 我会见彭德怀司令员

    我会见彭德怀司令员
    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”团长  李德全
    本团在三月二十三日抵达朝鲜，在进行对美帝国主义细菌战罪行的全面调查期间，我和本团副团长廖承志先生及本团秘书长宫乃泉先生，特代表本团全体同志，拜访了中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军。
    当我们和彭司令员亲切握手后，我还来不及表白我的来意，他便首先向我对祖国人民组织调查团前来战地调查美帝国主义进行细菌战罪行表示感谢。他说：“调查团来，充分表现了祖国人民对朝鲜战争的深切关怀。”他并振奋地说：“这就是我们力量的无比强大和胜利的具体表现。”
    在我谈到调查团来到朝鲜耳闻目睹美帝国主义撒布带细菌昆虫的种种证据后，他坚毅而愤慨地指出：“敌人这一罪行并不是偶然的。”他用各种事实证明美国侵略者早在第二次世界大战时期就积极准备进行细菌战，他还说：“去年一月日本细菌战犯石井四郎来到汉城，就是为了准备在朝鲜实现这一绝灭人性的可耻阴谋。”
    但是敌人为什么恰恰在这个时候使用细菌武器呢？彭司令员在详细分析了朝鲜战局的变化时指出：“事实摆得如此明显，敌人原来夸耀飞机大炮是万能的，想以军事力量征服朝鲜北部，进而向中国东北进攻，经过一年多的战争，敌人的计划遭到彻底粉碎，被迫进行朝鲜停战谈判。在谈判期间，敌人进行了所谓‘秋季攻势’，结果又失败了。敌人的一切可耻行为，遭到中朝人民部队的沉重打击后，于是就在朝鲜进行了大规模的细菌战，企图以此来威胁朝鲜人民和朝中部队。”彭德怀司令员严正地说：“我要正告敌人：你们企图以你们认为‘意义重大’的细菌战来吓倒中朝人民和征服中朝人民军队的坚强的战斗意志，这条路是行不通的；你们的如意算盘，在世界人民的正义声讨下，一定会得到不如意的结果！”
    是的，正如彭司令员所说，敌人进行细菌战，不仅军事上得不到什么好处，相反在政治上乃是一个极大的失败。它的结果，是使全世界人民更加清楚地认识了美国侵略者极端野蛮的狰狞面貌，更激怒了中朝人民和世界人民。彭司令员庄严地表示：“为正义为和平而战的人民和人民军队是不会被这些野心家所吓倒的。”他讲到了战胜敌人细菌战的各种条件，和数十天来防疫经验，使我充满了战胜敌人细菌战的无限信心。
    但是，从我们调查的情况看到，敌人此次进行的细菌战，其规模是很大的。如果不动员最大力量，和世界一切爱好和平人民一致声讨和制止美国侵略者的罪行；敌人就有可能把细菌战扩展到地球上的每一块土地上去，将给人类带来更大的灾害。因此，彭司令员以十分关怀的口气要我转告祖国人民，尤其是沿海各省和东北人民，更要注意提高警惕；并要我转告祖国人民和向世界人民呼吁，应一致团结起来，援助正在和敌人飞机大炮和细菌武器作战的朝鲜人民。
    最后，彭司令员再次欢迎和感谢调查团来到朝鲜，他说：“你们的工作，更鼓舞了志愿军和朝鲜人民军的反细菌战的坚强信心。”他并感谢由祖国志愿来到朝鲜的各位专家。他乐观地对比了敌人目前的各种困难，和我们日益强大的力量后加重口气说：“胜利是我们的，一定是我们的！”
    在结束以上的谈话后，我们还顺便地谈到人民志愿军女战士的情况。彭将军满意地说：“六千个女同志中，八百个是功臣，而大部分都是医务功臣。”这就意味着在反细菌战线上，她们将成为一支重要的生力军。在此，我向这些女战士女英雄表示敬意。
    今天，当我回到祖国来，除了把全团所搜集的美帝国主义细菌战的罪证，作成报告书，公布于全国、全世界人民面前，控诉美帝国主义的滔天罪行外，我必须向全国人民表白我和彭司令员的这次会谈。通过这次谈话，提高了我对美帝国主义进行细菌战的认识。现在我以高度的热情，向祖国人民，全世界一切有人道感的朋友们呼吁，希望你们紧急动员起来，制止美帝国主义者违反人道、绝灭人性、并为国际公法所绝对禁止的细菌战的弥天大罪，并要求你们从各方面加紧援助为祖国独立为世界和平而战的朝鲜人民，为早日扑灭美帝国主义的侵略火焰而奋斗。（新华社）
