Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, Eighth—The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, after creating the "May Day" tragedy, not only show no remorse but are continuing large-scale arrests in various places. According to official announcements, as of the morning of the 7th, 321 people had been arrested in Tokyo, including Tokyo Metropolitan University professor Shibata Terazawa (transliteration) and Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly JCP member Yamazaki. Sixty-three people were arrested in Kyoto. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," police also arrested 19 people in Shimonoseki on the 5th, including Ushida, chairman of the "Takamatsu" mine branch of the Japan Coal Miners' Union.

On the 6th, Justice Minister Tokutaro Kimura of the Yoshida government reported to both houses of the Diet on the bloody events caused by the suppression of the "May Day" demonstrations, attempting to shirk the government's responsibility and create excuses for the mass arrests, but he failed. Opposition parties condemned the Yoshida government for being responsible for the incident because it unreasonably prohibited the masses celebrating "May Day" from using the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace. Japanese Communist Party Senator Kaneiwa Den'ichi pointed out that the "May Day" tragedy was caused by American military police, who fired the first shots. He also said that Japanese police killed a total of eight people. JCP Representative Kazahaya Hachijuni advocated that the government should apologize to the people, compensate the victims, and dismiss Tokyo Police Chief Tanaka and all police officers who participated in the massacre.

    美日反动派竟图推卸罪责
    继续大规模逮捕爱国者
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：美、日反动派在制造“五一”惨案之后，不仅毫无悔祸之心，而且正在各地继续进行大规模的逮捕。据官方宣布，截至七日晨为止，东京逮捕了三百二十一人，被捕者中有东京都立大学教授柴田寺泽（译音）和东京都议会日共议员山崎。在京都逮捕了六十三人。据“每日新闻”报道：五日，警察在下关也逮捕了十九人，其中有日本煤矿工会“高松”矿分会主席牛田。
    六日，吉田政府法务府总裁木村笃太郎在向国会参众两院报告由于镇压“五一”节大示威而造成的血腥事件时，力图推卸政府的责任、为大逮捕制造藉口，但是未能成功。在野党纷纷谴责吉田政府应对事件负责，因为它无理禁止庆祝“五一”节的群众使用皇宫前广场。日本共产党参议员兼岩传一指出：“五一”惨案是由美国宪兵引起的，他们首先开的枪。他又说：日本警察共杀死了八个人。日共众议员风早八十二主张政府应向人民道歉，抚恤被难者，开除东京警察总监田中以及参加屠杀的一切警察。
