    Organizing is Stronger than Going it Alone
    By Li Qun, Zhang Huaixin, Yao Heng, Jilin, Hao Chao, Yun Ting

    (I) Wang Quanbao of Wangjia Village was originally a poor peasant. He suffered greatly from the exploitation of the landlords. Although he worked all year round, he could only afford to eat bran and wild herbs. In 1945, after the Japanese invaders surrendered, Wangjia Village was liberated, and Wang Quanbao was allocated land and a donkey during the land reform, and he turned over a new leaf. However, at that time, there were many wartime duties, and labor and animal power were still insufficient, so Wang Quanbao had his son help pull the plow like livestock.

    (II) At this time, the Wangjia Village Party branch, in response to the production problems raised by the masses, promoted getting organized. Zhang Weimin, the branch secretary, said to everyone, "Chairman Mao told us that organizing labor into mutual aid teams saves labor and produces more grain than farming alone." Wang Quanbao thought that this was exactly what he wanted, so he organized a mutual aid team.

    (III) After organizing, within a few years, Wangjia Village became a prosperous village with herds of mules and horses, which more powerfully supported the Liberation War.

    （一）王家庄的王全保，原是一个贫农。他受尽了地主的剥削，虽是常年劳动，但只能吃糠咽菜。一九四五年日寇投降，王家庄解放了，王全保在土地改革中分到地和驴，翻了身。可是当时战争勤务多，劳畜力还不足，所以王全保耕地要他儿子配牲口拉。
    （二）这时候，王家庄党支部针对群众提出的生产问题，宣传组织起来。支部书记张为民对大家说：“毛主席告诉我们把劳动力组织在互助组里，比起单独耕种省工，又能多打粮食。”王全保听了，觉得这事正合自己的意，便组织起互助组来。
    （三）组织起来以后，不多几年，王家庄就变成骡马成群的富裕村子，更有力地支援了解放战争。
