    He Wanzeng, Head of Iron Melting Group at Jiaozuo Mining Bureau,
    Improves Iron Melting Furnace and Eliminates Defective Products
    Editor: He Wanzeng, the head of the iron melting group at the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's foundry workshop, used to be conservative in his thinking, believing that he was incapable of improving furnaces made by others. The production team leader, newly returned from Xinxiang, told He Wanzeng about the advanced experience of workers at the Xinxiang Plain Machine Factory in improving iron melting furnaces. He Wanzeng thought, if others can improve iron melting furnaces, why can't we? He excitedly discussed and studied the issue with the production team leader. After careful consideration, he finally identified the problem with the iron melting furnace. The problem was that the diameter of the air nozzle of the iron melting furnace was too narrow and the nozzle was too long, so a large amount of air could not enter, affecting the combustion power of the coal. If the coal did not burn vigorously, the iron would melt slowly. As a result, defective products were produced, and the molten iron was pasty. He immediately began to improve it, increasing the diameter of the air nozzle, shortening the length of the nozzle, and increasing the air supply. He also added a layer of iron rings to the iron melting furnace to increase the capacity of the furnace. The results of the trial implementation of this method were that the iron melting time was shortened by one hour, and defective products were eliminated, and pasty molten iron was no longer produced. In the past, one jin of coal could only melt three jin of iron, but now it can melt five jin of iron; each furnace of iron melted can save 1,300 jin of coal.

    焦作矿务局化铁组长何万增
    改进化铁炉消灭了废品
    编辑同志：焦作矿务局铸工班化铁小组长何万增，过去思想保守，以为别人制造的炉子，自己没有能力改进。生产组长新从新乡回来，把新乡平原机厂工人改进化铁炉的先进经验告诉了何万增。何万增一想，人家能改进化铁炉，咱就不能？他兴奋地和生产组长讨论研究起来。他仔细考虑后，终于找出了化铁炉的毛病。这一毛病是化铁炉风嘴口径太狭、风嘴太长，风不能大量进去，影响煤炭的燃烧力。煤烧得不旺，铁也就化得慢。因此，产生了废品，出了浆铁水。他立即着手改进，把风嘴口径加大，嘴长缩短，增加了送风量。他还把化铁炉加了一层铁圈，使化铁炉的容量增加。照这个办法试行的结果，化铁时间缩短了一小时，还消灭了废品，不再出浆铁水了。过去一斤煤炭只化三斤铁，现在可化五斤铁；每化一炉铁，就可以节省一千三百斤煤炭。    焦仁
