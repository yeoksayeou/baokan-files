    Su Nan Gaochun County Middle School Leadership Should Strengthen Regular Current Affairs Education for Students
    To the Editor: The leadership of Gaochun County Middle School in Su Nan should educate students to care about current affairs and study them.
    Many students at Gaochun County Middle School usually do not pay attention to current affairs and rarely go to the reading room to read newspapers. When the students know that a current affairs test is about to be held, they temporarily cram in the reading room; after the test, there are fewer people reading newspapers again. Recently, the school held a current affairs test, and out of the two hundred and seventy-six students who took the test, one hundred and thirteen failed. This shows that although tests can exert a temporary supervisory effect, they are not a fundamental way to reverse the phenomenon of neglecting current affairs study. To completely reverse this tendency, we must solve the problem of students' contempt for current affairs study ideologically. This requires the school leadership to strengthen regular political and current affairs education.

    苏南高淳县立中学领导方面
    应对学生加强经常性的时事教育
    编辑同志：苏南高淳县立中学的领导方面，应该教育学生们关心时事学习。
    高淳县立中学的许多学生，平时不关心时事问题，很少有人到阅报室阅读报纸。同学们知道要举行时事测验了，临时到阅报室去突击；测验过后，阅报的人就又少起来了。最近学校举行了一次时事测验，参加测验的二百七十六个学生中，有一百一十三个不及格。这就说明：测验虽然可以发挥暂时的督促作用，但并不是扭转忽视时事学习现象的根本方法。要想彻底扭转这种倾向，必须从思想上解决同学们轻视时事学习的问题。这就要求学校领导方面加强经常的政治和时事教育。
