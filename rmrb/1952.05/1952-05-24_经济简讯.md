Economic Briefs

	▲ Several million tea farmers in the Huangshan and Dabie Mountains of Anhui Province have begun the most intensive tea harvesting and processing work. The outer mountain tea in Qimen and Taiping counties in southern Anhui and Lu'an and Jinzhai counties in northern Anhui have been picked and initial processing has begun. Thanks to the strong support of the People's Government for tea farmers' production after liberation, tea production in Anhui Province has increased year by year. In Huizhou Prefecture, a famous tea-producing area, the total tea output in 1950 increased by 96 percent compared with 1949, and in 1951 it increased by 243 percent compared with 1949. It is estimated that this year's tea output will increase by 27 to 30 percent compared with last year.
	▲ Pingyuan Province has achieved great success in eliminating pests and protecting wheat. Since late March this year, wheat fields in Pingyuan have successively discovered wheat aphids, wheat leaf bees, and red spiders; by late April, pests had spread to 7 million mu of wheat fields in 47 counties in six special districts throughout the province. Under the leadership of the people's governments at all levels, the people of Pingyuan carried out a large-scale pest control campaign to protect wheat. The number of people participating in pest control throughout the province reached 2 million. Pest control has been conducted two to three times in general areas, and seven times in areas with severe pest infestations. At present, pests have been basically eliminated in 3.27 million mu of wheat fields, and pests have been eliminated by more than 50% in another 2.1 million mu of wheat fields. Other areas are concentrating their efforts on pest control.
	▲ Xiao Fuli, a young worker in the Machine Department of the State-owned Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, added parts to the tool holder of the original lathe and improved it to create an automatic tool holder. This improvement simplifies operating techniques, and trainees can also operate it after the dimensions are set. This improvement also allows the latent capacity of the lathe to be fully exploited. Taking thread cutting as an example, in the past, when the factory cut one-inch double-threaded screws, the cutting tool would run at 150 revolutions per minute, and the tool would not be able to retract; with the automatic tool holder, the tool can be retracted even when running at 1,500 revolutions. This has cleared a major technical obstacle for the adoption of high-speed cutting methods. Now the efficiency of the factory's screw cutting has increased sevenfold compared to the past.
	▲ Employees of the gasoline branch of an oil refinery in Northwest China used their collective wisdom to double kerosene production. The factory's original equipment could only produce gasoline, and it began producing kerosene in mid-February this year. Initially, because the temperature of the crude oil could not be raised to a higher level, the kerosene produced was only about 2.3 percent. Later, employees came up with a way to heat the crude oil, and the refining rate increased to 7.5 percent. This technological improvement will increase the country's production by more than 11 billion yuan throughout the year.
	▲ After a year and eight months of effort, the employees of the Xicun Power Plant in Guangzhou have repaired a 15,000-kilowatt high-voltage giant generator that had been abandoned for twelve years. The value of the generator is more than 4 billion yuan. In the process of repairing it, they made all the high-voltage coils themselves, which accumulated important experience for China's self-made large generators. This generator officially started generating electricity on May 8.
	▲ The drilling team of the Basic Construction Engineering Company of the Northeast Beipiao Mining Bureau successfully drilled hard rock with drill grains (i.e., iron filings) drill bits, increasing drilling efficiency by nearly two times. In the past, they always used diamond steel drill bits when encountering harder rocks, and only used drill grain drill bits for soft rocks. The method of drilling hard rock with drill grain drill bits was introduced to Chinese workers by Soviet experts. This year, according to this method, the team increased the amount of sand used in the drill grain drill bits from 1.5 kilograms per three shifts to 4.5 kilograms per one shift. The efficiency of drilling sandy shale and sandstone increased from 2.4 meters per shift to 7 meters. In order to systematically learn from the advanced experience of Soviet drilling, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government has launched an advanced class of drilling training courses in April.

    经济简讯
    ▲安徽地区黄山、大别山一带几百万茶农，已开始进行最紧张的茶叶采制工作。皖南祁门、太平和皖北六安、金寨等县的外山茶，都已采摘并开始进行初制。由于解放后人民政府大力扶助茶农生产，安徽地区茶叶产量逐年提高。著名产茶区——徽州专区，一九五○年全区茶叶产量较一九四九年增加了百分之九十六，一九五一年较一九四九年增加了百分之二百四十三，今年的茶叶产量估计比去年能提高百分之二十七到百分之三十。
    ▲平原省灭虫保麦工作已取得很大成绩。今年自三月下旬以来，平原麦田相继发现麦蚜、麦叶蜂及红蜘蛛等虫害；四月下旬，虫害已遍及全省六个专区四十七个县的七百万亩麦田。平原人民在各级人民政府领导下，进行了大规模的灭虫保麦斗争，全省参加灭虫的人数前后达二百万人，一般地区都捕打过两遍到三遍，虫害严重的地区有捕打过七遍的。目前已基本消灭虫害的麦田已达三百二十七万亩，另有二百一十多万亩麦田的虫害已消灭百分之五十以上。其他地区正在集中力量捕打。
    ▲国营济南第二机器厂机工部青年工人萧福利，在原有车床的刀架上增加零件，加以改进，制成自动刀架。这一改进简化了操作技术，在定好尺寸后，练习生也可操作。这一改进也使车床的潜在能力充分发挥出来。以车丝杠为例，该厂过去车一寸双扣丝杠，车刀每分钟打一百五十转，就发生刀退不出的现象；用自动刀架后即使打到一千五百转，也退得出刀。这样便为采用高速切削法扫清了技术上的一大困难。现在该厂车丝杠的效率已比过去提高了七倍。
    ▲西北某油矿炼油厂汽油分厂职工发挥集体智慧，使煤油产量提高两倍。该厂原有设备只能出产汽油，今年二月中旬开始生产煤油。最初因原油温度不能提高到较高程度，所提炼的煤油只有百分之二点三左右。以后，职工想出加热原油的办法，炼油率提高到百分之七点五。这一技术改进，全年给国家增产一百一十亿元以上。
    ▲广州西村电厂职工经过一年八个月的努力，已把废弃了十二年的一部一万五千瓩的高压巨型发电机修复，发电机价值在四十亿元以上。他们在修复过程中自制全部高压线圈，为我国自制大型发电机积累了重要经验。这部发电机已在五月八日正式开始发电。
    ▲东北北票矿务局基本建设工程公司钻探队，用钻粒（即铁砂子）钻头钻硬岩成功，钻岩效率提高近二倍。他们过去遇到较硬岩石从来都是使用钻石钢钻头，对软岩石才使钻粒钻头。用钻粒钻头钻硬岩的办法是苏联专家向中国工人介绍的。该队今年根据这种办法，把钻粒钻头的用砂量由原来三小班一公斤半增加到一小班四公斤半后，钻砂质页岩和砂岩的效率就由每小班二点四公尺提高到七公尺。东北人民政府工业部为了系统地学习苏联钻探的先进经验，已在四月份起开办钻探训练班高级班。
