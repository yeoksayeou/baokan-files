Comrades: Since the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Tibetan people of Tibet have, over the past year, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, achieved glorious liberation and freed themselves from imperialist oppression. Today, on the anniversary of the signing of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, let me first congratulate the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and all Tibetan people and Tibetan monks and laypeople.

The Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, in accordance with the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, have taken a number of measures in Tibet related to the development of production, trade, health, and transportation, and have achieved preliminary successes, particularly in resolving the various difficulties caused by imperialism to Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, handicrafts, and commerce. The religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people have also been fully protected and respected by the personnel of the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army sent to Tibet.

As a result of these facts, the monks and laypeople of Tibet love Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and have strengthened their unity with all fraternal nationalities, especially the Han nationality. At the same time, the Panchen Erdeni has returned to Tibet, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni have met closely, and the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality has gradually been strengthened. They have all expressed their determination to thoroughly implement the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government.

These facts concretely and powerfully demonstrate the greatness of Chairman Mao's nationality policy, and show that the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army are helping the Tibetan people build a new Tibet and improve the lives of the Tibetan people in accordance with the principles of national equality and unity. It also shows that the Tibetan people are willing to unite, to join hands with all fraternal nationalities to jointly defend the motherland and build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

However, the imperialists are unwilling to see the liberation of the Tibetan people and the Tibetan people's attainment of a happy life. Although their conspiracies to invade Tibet have been repeatedly thwarted, their activities to undermine the unity of the various nationalities of China have not been relaxed in the slightest. Therefore, the people of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China, especially the Tibetan people of Tibet, must heighten their vigilance, resolutely unite in the big family of mutual assistance and love among all nationalities of China, and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, wage a resolute struggle against the destructive conspiracies of imperialism.

All our personnel and troops entering Tibet must also heighten their vigilance, strictly guard against imperialist instigation and other destructive acts, resolutely implement the policy of national unity and national equality, strictly implement the policy of protecting freedom of religious belief and respecting Tibetan customs, and prepare to help the Tibetan local government and the Tibetan people, with gradually increasing strength, in all construction undertakings that are beneficial to the Tibetan people.

    董必武副总理的讲话
    同志们：自从和平解放西藏办法的协议签订以来，过去一年来，西藏的藏族人民，在中央人民政府的领导下和人民解放军的协助下，已获得了光荣的解放，并摆脱了帝国主义的压迫。今天，在和平解放西藏办法的协议签订一周年的纪念日，让我首先向达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼及所有藏族人民和西藏僧俗人民祝贺。
    中央人民政府和人民解放军依照和平解放西藏办法的协议，在西藏采取了若干有关发展生产、贸易、卫生和交通事业的措施，特别是在解除帝国主义对西藏的农业、牧畜业、手工业和商业所造成的各种困难方面，获得了初步的成就。西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，也完全受到了中央人民政府和人民解放军派到西藏去的工作人员和部队人员的保护和尊重。
    由于这些事实，西藏的僧俗人民热爱毛主席和中央人民政府，加强了和各兄弟民族，特别是和汉民族的团结。同时，班禅额尔德尼回藏了，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密地会见了，西藏民族内部的团结已逐渐增强了。他们都表示了愿意在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下彻底实现“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的决心。
    这些事实，具体地、有力地说明了毛主席的民族政策的伟大，说明了中央人民政府和人民解放军正在依照民族平等和团结的原则，帮助藏族人民建设新西藏，改善西藏人民的生活。同时也说明了西藏人民愿意团结，愿意和各兄弟民族携起手来，共同保卫祖国，建设繁荣和幸福的新西藏。
    但是，帝国主义是不愿意看见西藏人民的解放和西藏人民获得幸福的生活的。他们侵略西藏的阴谋虽然屡遭挫败，但是他们破坏中国各族人民团结的活动，并未丝毫放松。因此，中华人民共和国各族人民，特别是西藏的藏族人民，必须提高警惕，坚决地团结在中国各民族互助友爱的大家庭中，在毛主席领导下，和帝国主义的破坏阴谋进行坚决的斗争。
    我们一切入藏的工作人员和部队人员，也必须提高警惕，严防帝国主义的挑拨离间和其他破坏行为，坚决地执行民族团结和民族平等政策，严格执行保护宗教信仰自由和尊重西藏风俗习惯的政策，并准备以逐渐增多的力量，帮助西藏地方政府和西藏人民进行一切有利于西藏人民的建设事业。
