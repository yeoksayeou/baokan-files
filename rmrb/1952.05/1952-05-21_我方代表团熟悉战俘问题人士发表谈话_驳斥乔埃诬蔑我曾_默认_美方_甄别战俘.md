(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 20) Joy, the chief representative of the U.S. delegation to the Korean armistice talks, stated at the joint delegation meetings on May 18 and 19 that the "screening" of our captured personnel by the other side was "tacitly approved" by our side. A reporter interviewed a person in our delegation familiar with POW issues on this matter, who made the following statement: In order to salvage its unreasonable "voluntary repatriation" proposition, which has long been completely bankrupt, the U.S. side has once again resorted to fabrication, falsely claiming that their absurd "screening" of our captured personnel was "tacitly approved" by our side and that our side is not against "screening" itself, but "the result of the screening". This slander is not worth refuting, because people all over the world are familiar with our position of advocating the complete repatriation of all prisoners of war. From the beginning of negotiations on the POW issue to the present, our side has consistently opposed all U.S. practices of forcibly detaining our captured personnel. When the U.S. side initially proposed the so-called idea of the International Committee of the Red Cross consulting each prisoner of war in the demilitarized zone as to whether they were willing to be repatriated, our side firmly opposed and thoroughly refuted this absurd method. It is inconceivable that our side would agree to the so-called "screening of POWs" completely handled by the U.S. side thereafter. Anyone with common sense knows that our suggestion to correct the POW lists exchanged by both sides on December 18 last year has nothing in common with the so-called "screening of POWs" proposed by the other side. Before both sides entered the correction of the POW list, our side clearly and unambiguously emphasized at the meeting that all POWs of other nationalities and foreign nationals held by both sides must be repatriated in full. Our side completely cannot agree with the absurd proposition of so-called "voluntary repatriation" or "no forced repatriation" implemented by the U.S. side. In order to express our position clearly again, after both parties agreed to enter the correction of the list, our headquarters issued a statement stating that both parties should release and repatriate all the prisoners of war they held; this reasonable proposition will never be changed because of some involuntary acts of our captured personnel during their detention that they should not be responsible for. These facts indisputably prove that throughout the entire discussion of the fourth item on the agenda, our side never directly or indirectly agreed to any of the so-called "screening of POWs" absurd methods of the other side. However, in the face of this unambiguous record, the U.S. representative actually fabricated that our side had tacitly approved the so-called "screening of POWs." This is truly a shameless, barefaced lie. After our side put forward the March 21 proposal, Colonel Hickman, the representative of the U.S. Chiefs of Staff, clearly admitted that our side's request for the other side to repatriate the number of 132,000 prisoners of war was an important component of our principles, and more than once promised to resolve the issue within the outline of our March 21 proposal. But now the U.S. side has completely overturned these clear promises. From this, it can be seen that it is the American aggressors who are going back on their word, contradicting themselves, acting recklessly, and betraying trust in the negotiations.

    我方代表团熟悉战俘问题人士发表谈话
    驳斥乔埃诬蔑我曾“默认”美方“甄别战俘”
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝鲜停战谈判的美方代表团首席代表乔埃在五月十八日与十九日的双方代表团大会上称：对方对我方被俘人员所进行的“甄别”是我方事先“默认”的。记者特就此事访问我方代表团熟悉战俘问题人士，承其发表谈话如下：美方为了挽救其早已彻底破产的“自愿遣返”的无理主张，不得不又一次乞灵于捏造，诬称他们对我方被俘人员进行荒谬的“甄别”是我方事先“默认”的。我方所反对的不是“甄别”本身而是“甄别的结果”。这种诬蔑是不值一驳的，因为全世界人民熟知我方主张全部遣返战俘的立场。从开始谈判战俘问题到现在，我方一贯反对美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的一切做法。当美方最初提出所谓由红十字国际委员会在非军事区内征询每一战俘是否愿意遣返的主张时，我方即坚决反对并已彻底驳倒了这种荒唐办法。不可能设想在这以后我方会同意完全由美方一手包办的所谓“甄别战俘”。凡有常识者都清楚我方建议校正去年十二月十八日双方所交换的战俘名单是与对方所提的所谓“甄别战俘”毫无相同之处。在双方进入校正战俘名单前，我方在会上曾明白无误地强调指出：双方所收容的他方他籍及他方外籍的战俘必须全部遣返，我方完全不能同意美方实行所谓“自愿遣返”或“不得强迫遣返”的荒谬主张。为了再次明确地表示我方的立场，我方司令部在双方同意进入校正名单后，又发表声明称：双方应释放并遣返各自收容的全部战俘；这种合理主张绝不因我方被俘人员在拘留期间的某些出于被迫的不应由他们负责的行为而有所改变。这些事实无可置辩地证明我方在第四项议程的整个讨论期间，从未直接或间接同意过对方的任何所谓“甄别战俘”的荒唐办法。但在这个不容曲解的记录面前，美方代表竟然捏造我方曾经默认过所谓“甄别战俘”。这真正是厚颜无耻的当面撒谎。在我方提出三月二十一日提案后，美方参谋会议代表希克曼上校明白承认我方要求对方遣返战俘的数字十三万二千是我方原则的重要构成部分，并不止一次地承诺愿意在我方三月二十一日提案的轮廓内解决问题。但现在美方彻底推翻了这些明确诺言。由此可见，在谈判中出尔反尔、自食其言、肆无忌惮、背信弃义的正是美国侵略者。
