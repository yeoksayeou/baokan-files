    Sixteen Districts of Beijing Begin to Emphasize Cadre's Study of Current Events

    Editor Comrade: The criticism made by Comrade Yan Xiangchun in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 26th regarding our lack of attention to the study of current events is correct. In the past, we did not help cadres with lower cultural levels in mass organizations and cadres working in rural areas to study current events, which was a major shortcoming. In the first half of 1951, the District Committee stipulated that current affairs reports should be given to all cadres in the district every half month, but we did not adhere to this. We emphasized that we were too busy with our own work and did not personally organize materials or give regular reports to the cadres. We only waited for the higher-level leading organs to make reports before conveying them downwards; and when conveying these reports, we did not notify the cadres working in rural areas to attend. We also stipulated that cadres in the office should take some time each day to read the newspaper, and cadres working in rural areas should subscribe to current affairs handbooks. Later, because we abandoned leadership and neglected to check, this regulation was not well implemented.
    In order to overcome the shortcomings in the study of current events, we have studied several improvement measures: First, the Propaganda Department of the District Committee will set up a full-time cadre to lead cadre study; second, consolidate and improve the learning organization and system, first restore the system of one hour of spare-time newspaper reading in various organs; third, subscribe to a copy of the current affairs handbook for each cadre working in rural areas, and the team leader will supervise their study, and establish an inspection and reporting system; fourth, stipulate Sunday as a study day for cadres working in rural areas, gathering them by region to organize discussions; fifth, reporters are assigned to be responsible for giving regular reports.

### 北京市十六区开始重视干部时事学习

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市十六区开始重视干部时事学习
    编辑同志：四月二十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了燕翔春同志对我们不注意时事学习的批评，这个批评是正确的。过去，我们没有帮助群众团体中文化水平较低的干部和下乡工作的干部进行时事学习，这是一个很大的缺点。一九五一年上半年，区委员会曾规定每半月向全区干部作一次时事报告，我们并没有坚持执行。我们强调自己工作忙，没有亲自组织材料，定期向干部们作报告，只是等待上级领导机关作了报告时，才向下传达；而传达这些报告时，我们也没有通知下乡工作的干部参加。我们还曾规定：在机关的干部每天要抽出一定的时间读报；下乡工作的干部要订阅时事手册。后来，也因为我们放弃领导和疏于检查，以致使这个规定没有很好实现。
    为了克服时事学习上的缺点，我们研究了几个改进办法：一、区委宣传部设专职干部领导干部学习；二、整顿和健全学习组织和制度，首先恢复各机关业余读报一小时的制度；三、给下乡工作的干部每人订一份时事手册，由工作组长督促他们学习，并建立检查和汇报制度；四、规定星期日为下乡工作的干部学习日，按地区集中，组织座谈；五、报告员分工负责定期作报告。
