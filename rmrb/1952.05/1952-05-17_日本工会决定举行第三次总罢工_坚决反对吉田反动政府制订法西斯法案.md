    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th—News: Japanese labor unions have decided to hold a third national general strike to continue their resolute struggle against the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" and against the revision of labor regulations and other suppressive measures.
    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo") held a meeting of its executive committee on the 7th, deciding to mobilize all union members to hold a third general strike. The meeting pointed out that the series of fascist legislative measures recently proposed by the Yoshida government are a provocation to all labor unions, and called on all union members to raise their vigilance and further prepare for the third general strike.
    On the 13th, "Sohyo" and the "Struggle Committee Against Degrading Labor Regulations" held a joint meeting to discuss the date, scale, and method of the third general strike. Approximately sixty representatives from thirty-four industrial unions attended this meeting. The meeting resolved to hold a third, more powerful general strike than the previous two, after May 28th. According to Sohyo Secretary-General Minoru Takano, the third general strike will be a large-scale strike involving 1.5 million people.
    Prior to this, on the 12th, twenty representatives from major Japanese labor unions submitted a letter of protest to Labor Minister Keiichi Yoshitake, protesting the Yoshida government's plan to revise labor regulations, and declaring their determination to express their resolve through a general strike.

    日本工会决定举行第三次总罢工
    坚决反对吉田反动政府制订法西斯法案
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本各工会组织决定将举行第三次全国总罢工，继续为反对“防止破坏活动法案”，反对修改劳工法规等镇压措施而坚决斗争。
    日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）在七日召开干事会议，决定动员全体工会会员举行第三次总罢工。会议指出，吉田政府最近提出的一系列法西斯的立法措施是对全体工会的挑衅，并号召全体工会会员一致提高警觉和进一步做好举行第三次总罢工的准备工作。
    十三日，“总评”与“反对改劣劳工法规斗争委员会”举行联合会议，讨论第三次总罢工的日期、规模和方法。参加这个会议的有三十四个产业工会的代表约六十人。会议决议在五月二十八日以后将举行比以前两次更加强有力的第三次总罢工。据“总评”事务局长高野实表示，第三次总罢工将是一个有一百五十万人参加的大规模的罢工。
    在此以前，日本各主要工会的二十名代表曾在十二日将一项抗议书交给劳动相吉武惠市，抗议吉田政府修改劳工法规的计划，并声明将以总罢工来表示他们的决心。
