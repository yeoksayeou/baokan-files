Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 21st dispatch: The 13th Universal Postal Congress of the Universal Postal Union has opened in Brussels, discussing proposals for revising and supplementing the International Postal Regulations, and preparing to reach special agreements on various postal services. Delegations from various countries, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, and various People's Democratic countries, are attending the conference.

At the opening meeting of the Congress on the 16th, the Soviet representative proposed that the Congress expel the Kuomintang clique representatives who do not represent anyone, and invite the representatives of the only legitimate representative of the Chinese people—the People's Republic of China—to participate in the Congress. The Soviet representative also pointed out that the People's Republic of China has extensive postal connections, and without its representatives participating in the discussion, the various problems of international postal services cannot be resolved.

The U.S. representative opposed this proposal and suggested postponing the decision on the Soviet proposal.

The chairman of the Congress, disregarding the Soviet delegation's request to put the Soviet proposal to a vote and disregarding the Soviet protest, put the U.S. proposal to a vote, and as a result, the U.S. proposal passed with a mechanical majority.

The Ukrainian representative proposed that the Congress expel the representatives of the Bao Dai regime of Vietnam, but the chairman, in violation of recognized rules, did not put this proposal to a vote.

The Belarusian representative suggested that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has formally declared its participation in the Universal Postal Union, so its representatives should be invited to attend the meeting. However, under pressure from the U.S. delegation, the mechanical majority at the Congress also rejected this proposal.

The decisions of the Congress show that the U.S. delegation is single-mindedly trying to prevent the expansion and consolidation of international conventions at the Congress.

The representatives of the Soviet Union, Belarus, and Hungary spoke in succession after the vote, pointing out that the decisions passed by the mechanical majority of the Congress were illegal and unjust.

    苏联代表在万国邮政大会上
    建议邀请我代表出席
    美代表操纵多数延期采取决定
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔讯：万国邮政联盟第十三届万国邮政大会已在布鲁塞尔开幕，讨论关于修改和补充国际邮政章程的建议，并准备就各项邮政业务取得专门协议。出席大会的有包括苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯及各人民民主国家在内的各国代表团。
    在大会十六日开幕会议上，苏联代表建议大会驱逐并不代表任何人的国民党集团代表，并邀请中国人民唯一合法的代表——中华人民共和国的代表参加大会。苏联代表并指出，中华人民共和国有着广泛的邮政联系，如果没有它的代表参加讨论，国际邮政业务的种种问题就不能解决。
    美国代表反对这个建议，而提议对苏联建议延期采取决定。
    大会主席不顾苏联代表团所提把苏联建议付诸表决的要求，并不顾苏联的抗议而把美国的建议付诸表决，结果美国的建议以机械多数通过。
    乌克兰代表建议大会驱逐越南保大政权的代表，然而主席却违反公认的规则，不把这建议付诸表决。
    白俄罗斯代表建议，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已经正式声明参加万国邮政联盟，所以应该邀请它的代表参加会议。可是，在美国代表团的压力之下，大会上的机械多数也拒绝了这建议。
    大会的决定表明，美国代表团在大会上一心要阻止国际公约的扩大和巩固。
    苏联、白俄罗斯和匈牙利代表在表决后相继发言，指出大会机械多数所通过的决定是非法的和不公道的。
