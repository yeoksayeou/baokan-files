    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: The peace movement within American labor unions is growing in scale. According to the New York "Worker Daily," many unions in New York are distributing postcards addressed to Truman, printed by the New York Union Peace Conference. These postcards state the disastrous consequences of military expansion for the country and the people, as well as the continuous decline in the living standards of the American people. At the same time, these postcards demand that Truman stop allocating the people's money for the establishment of foreign troops and bases; instead, for the sake of peace, a conference of the five major powers should be convened to reach an agreement on disarmament and the establishment of peace, in order to eliminate world tensions.
    The United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) convention recently held in Denver unanimously passed a resolution advocating the resolution of all international differences through peaceful negotiation.
    The recent convention of the International Fur and Leather Workers Union held in Chicago passed many resolutions on the struggle for peace, civil rights, and economic rights. The convention also demanded an immediate end to the Korean War, disarmament of all countries, and the establishment of free and peaceful trade. The convention also demanded that the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China immediately hold a meeting to peacefully resolve all problems, and continue to hold meetings until lasting peace is guaranteed.

    反对美国政府扩军备战政策
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国工会中的和平运动规模日有发展。据纽约“工人日报”消息，纽约的许多工会正散发纽约工会和平会议印发的致杜鲁门的明信片。这些明信片陈述扩张军备带来的祸国殃民的后果，以及美国人民生活水准的不断下降。同时，这些明信片要求杜鲁门停止把人民的钱拨供建立外国军队与基地之用，而相反地，为了和平，应召开五大国会议，达成裁减军备并建立和平的协议，以消除世界的紧张局势。
    最近在丹佛举行的产联屠宰业工会代表大会一致通过决议，主张经由和平谈判方法，解决国际上所有的歧见。
    最近在芝加哥举行的毛皮工人国际工会代表大会就争取和平、争取民权与经济权利等等的斗争通过许多决议。代表大会同时要求立刻结束朝鲜战争、裁减所有国家的军备、并建立自由和平的贸易。代表大会并要求美、苏、英、法、中五国政府立刻举行会议，以和平解决所有问题，并继续举行会议，直到持久和平得到保障为止。
