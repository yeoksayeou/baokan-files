    Xinmin Distillery Workers Shen Yu Guangrong Xi Hai
    Use Wheat Bran Instead of Corn Flour to Make Wine Ferment, Saving 500,000 Jin of Corn Flour Annually
    Editor: Xinmin Distillery technical workers Shen Yu Guang and Rong Xi Hai of Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, created an operating method of manufacturing wine ferment "using wheat bran instead of corn flour." In the past, they had to use raw materials such as wheat bran and corn flour to make wine ferment. They felt that if they used wheat bran entirely, they could save a lot of grain. They raised this issue at a technical meeting. Some workers thought this method was unreasonable, and that it was impossible to do without any corn flour. They patiently conducted experiments and finally succeeded, correcting some workers' old ways of thinking. After the factory implemented this method, it could save 576,000 jin of corn flour annually. The new method of making wine ferment is even better than the old method, increasing the output of wine.

    用麸子代包米面制成酒曲  每年节省包米面五十万斤
    编辑同志：辽西省新民县新民制酒厂技术工人沈宇光、荣希海创造了“以麸子代替包米面”制造酒曲的操作法。过去他们制造酒曲，必须使用麸子、包米面等原料。他们觉得如果完全使用麸子，就能节省很多粮食。他们在技术会议上提出这个问题。有的工人认为这种办法不合理，一点包米面不用是不行的。他们耐心地进行试验，终于获得成功，纠正了某些工人的老一套的看法。这个厂实行了这一操作法后，每年可节省五十七万六千斤包米面。新法制出的酒曲，比过去的还好，提高了酒的产量。
