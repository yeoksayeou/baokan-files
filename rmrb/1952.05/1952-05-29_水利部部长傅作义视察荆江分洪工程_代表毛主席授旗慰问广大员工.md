The banners were inscribed with Chairman Mao's own handwriting: "For the interests of the broad masses of people, strive for the victory of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project!" In addition, 14,000 copies of Chairman Mao's inscription were printed and awarded to model workers.

On May 24th, a grand flag-presentation and condolence meeting was held in Shashi. Those present included Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern Military and Administrative Committee; Liu Fei, Minister of Water Resources; Chen Mingshu, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry; Tang Tianji, Commander-in-Chief of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project; leading cadres of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Headquarters; and representatives of technicians, military personnel, and civilian laborers, totaling more than 1,000 people. At the meeting, Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi presented the flag on behalf of Chairman Mao, and Tang Tianji, Commander-in-Chief of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, accepted the flag on behalf of 300,000 military personnel and civilian laborers. The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time. Following this, Minister Fu Zuoyi delivered a speech, stating: "Chairman Mao is always concerned about the progress of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and the lives of millions of people on both sides of the Jingjiang River. During the tense period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government were determined to allocate so much money to build this huge project. This once again proves the truth that the people of the whole country call Chairman Mao the 'sun.' The 300,000 workers participating in the flood diversion project have enthusiastically implemented Chairman Mao's great decision. In the past month and a half, 60 percent of the entire flood diversion project has been completed. The fact that this huge project has achieved such great results in a short period of time is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and it also proves the great superiority of New Democracy." At the meeting, Minister Fu Zuoyi extended his sincere condolences to the many heroes and model figures who had emerged during the project. Finally, he called on all personnel to make persistent efforts and do the project even better. Tang Tianji, Commander-in-Chief of the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, delivered a reply on behalf of all the workers, thanking Chairman Mao for his concern and rewards, and expressing his determination to make greater efforts, launch a more enthusiastic patriotic labor competition, and complete the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project on schedule. After inspecting and offering condolences at various construction sites, Fu Zuoyi and Bukov departed for Beijing on the 26th.

In addition, the Central and Southern Military and Administrative Committee Condolence Group, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Central and Southern Military Region Condolence Group, and condolence groups composed of the people's governments of Hubei, Hunan, Wuhan, Changsha, and other provinces and cities, as well as various democratic parties and people's organizations, successively went to the Jingjiang Dike reinforcement and Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project construction sites to offer condolences. The Central and Southern Military and Administrative Committee Condolence Group was led by Zhang Nanxian, Vice Chairman of the Central and Southern Military and Administrative Committee, as the head of the condolence group. When the Central and Southern Military Region's condolence group went to offer condolences, they also brought a letter of condolence jointly signed by Lin Biao, Commander of the Central and Southern Military Region, and Luo Ronghuan, Deng Zihui, and Tan Zheng, political commissars. Many condolence groups included cultural troupes, ballad singing teams, acrobatic troupes, Peking opera troupes, or Xiang opera troupes, who performed condolences at various construction sites and were warmly welcomed by the vast number of technicians, military personnel, and civilian laborers.
