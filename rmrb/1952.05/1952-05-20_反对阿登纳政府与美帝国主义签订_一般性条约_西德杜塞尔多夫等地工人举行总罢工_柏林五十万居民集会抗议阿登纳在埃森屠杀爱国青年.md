Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Reports from the German News Agency state that the momentum of the West German workers' movement against the Adenauer government is growing. In the two days of the 15th and 16th, general strikes were held in the major industrial centers of Dusseldorf, Cologne, Brunswick, and Hamburg, with more than 300,000 workers holding large-scale demonstrations against the Adenauer government's attempt to sign the militarist "General Treaty" with the United States and against the Adenauer government's preparation to implement the so-called Trade Union Organization Law, which deprives workers of their rights in order to facilitate rearmament. During the workers' strikes, factories and public transportation in these cities were completely paralyzed.

Among these cities, the strike and demonstration held by Hamburg workers on the 16th were the largest in scale. More than 150,000 workers and staff formed a large demonstration team, entering the trade union building from all directions to hold a rally. The slogan of the rally was: "We are determined to fight against the Trade Union Organization Law and the General Treaty." The right-wing trade union leadership controlled by the Social Democratic Party attempted to lead the West German workers' struggle onto a non-political path and prevent demonstrators from chanting slogans against Adenauer's war policy, but they failed.

Workers in Dusseldorf went on strike on the 15th. More than 70,000 workers held a mass rally. At the meeting, the workers expressed their determination to prevent Adenauer's war laws from being implemented by all means of the trade union.

All factories in Cologne also went on strike on the 15th, with approximately 60,000 workers and staff holding a demonstration. The demonstrators carried banners with slogans calling on West German workers to fight against the Trade Union Organization Law and against the deprivation of workers' rights.

Workers in Brunswick went on strike on the same day. 50,000 workers, staff, and civil servants united to hold a powerful demonstration against the Trade Union Organization Law drafted by the Adenauer government. The slogans on the banners carried by the workers during the demonstration were: Demand the protection of workers' rights, down with the Adenauer government.

TASS News Agency, 19th: Fifty thousand residents of Berlin, capital of the German Democratic Republic, held a rally on Marx-Engels Square on the 16th, angrily protesting the Adenauer government of West Germany for the atrocities of shooting demonstrating youth against the "General Treaty" in Essen. This atrocity has awakened the entire German people to struggle like an alarm.

On May 11, more than 10,000 young people in West Germany held a demonstration in Essen against the militarist "General Treaty." The Adenauer government, in a state of panic, dispatched armed police to open fire on the demonstrators, killing three young people. The American occupiers and their puppet Adenauer originally wanted to use the bloody suppression in Essen to strike at the will of the West German people to resist. However, contrary to their expectations, the Essen incident not only failed to intimidate West German patriots but instead promoted the further upsurge of the movement of the entire German people against the "General Treaty" and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The people in West Germany and the German Democratic Republic who were enraged have launched a movement to protest the Essen massacre.

The Berlin rally concentratedly expressed the righteous indignation of the entire German people. The Speaker of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Jandretzki, Chairman of the Free German Youth League, Honnecker, and the famous peace fighter, Mrs. Wachter, spoke at the meeting. The conference adopted a resolution, angrily protesting against the atrocities of Adenauer and Lehr in killing young peace fighters. The conference also resolved to express condolences to the relatives of the heroes of the murdered peace movement and pledged to fight to punish those responsible for this shameless massacre. The resolution called for intensifying the struggle for the conclusion of a peace treaty and against the militarist "General Treaty".

In West Germany, the German Workers' Committee Against Remilitarization has issued a statement denouncing the terrorist acts of Adenauer's murderers. Protest rallies have been held in many cities in West Germany.

    反对阿登纳政府与美帝国主义签订“一般性条约”
    西德杜塞尔多夫等地工人举行总罢工
    柏林五十万居民集会抗议阿登纳在埃森屠杀爱国青年
    【新华社十九日讯】据德意志通讯社讯：西德工人反对阿登纳政府的运动的声势越来越大了。在十五、十六两天之内，杜塞尔多夫、科隆、不伦瑞克、汉堡这几个大工业中心都举行了总罢工，三十多万工人举行了大示威，反对阿登纳政府企图与美国签订军国主义的“一般性条约”，反对阿登纳政府准备实施剥夺工人权利以便于重新武装的所谓工会组织法。在工人罢工期间，这些城市的工厂及公共交通完全陷于停顿。
    在这些城市中，汉堡工人十六日举行的罢工和示威规模最大。十五万以上的工人与职员排成壮大的示威队伍，从四面八方进入工会大厦的会场，举行大会。大会的口号是：“我们坚决为反对工会组织法与一般性条约而斗争”。社会民主党控制的右翼工会领导机构，企图把西德工人的斗争导入非政治性的道路，并阻止示威者高呼反对阿登纳战争政策的口号，但是他们失败了。
    杜塞尔多夫工人在十五日罢工。七万多工人举行了群众集会。工人们在会上表示决心以工会所有的一切方法防止阿登纳的战争法律付诸实施。
    科隆的一切工厂也在十五日罢工，约有六万名工人和职员举行了示威。示威者打着横旗，这些旗子上面写的口号号召西德工人进行反对工会组织法和反对剥夺工人权利的斗争。
    不伦瑞克工人在同一天罢工。五万工人、职员和公务员团结起来举行了反对阿登纳政府所拟订的工会组织法的强大示威。工人在示威游行中拿的旗帜上写的口号是：要求保障工人权利，打倒阿登纳政府。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社消息：德意志民主共和国首都柏林五十万居民十六日在马克思、恩格斯广场举行大会，愤怒地抗议西德阿登纳政府在埃森枪杀反对“一般性条约”示威青年的暴行。这桩暴行已像警报一样唤醒了全德国人民起来斗争了。
    五月十一日，西德一万多青年在埃森举行反对军国主义的“一般性条约”的示威，阿登纳政府惊惶万状之余竟出动武装警察向示威者开枪，打死了三个青年。美国占领者及其傀儡阿登纳原来想以埃森的血腥镇压来打击西德人民反抗的意志，但是和他们的预计恰恰相反，埃森事件非但没有吓倒西德爱国志士，反而促使全德国人民反对“一般性条约”、争取祖国和平统一运动进一步高涨。西德与德意志民主共和国各地被激怒了的人民已经展开了抗议埃森血案的运动。
    柏林大会集中地表现了全德国人民的义愤。德意志民主共和国人民议会议长狄克曼、副总理努舍克、德国统一社会党中央政治局委员詹德里茨基、自由德国青年联盟主席昂纳克与著名和平战士瓦赫特夫人在会上讲了话。大会通过决议，愤怒地抗议阿登纳和勒尔杀害青年和平战士的暴行。大会也决议向遇害的和平运动的英雄的亲属表示慰问，并保证决心为惩办那些对这次无耻的屠杀负责的人而奋斗。决议号召加紧为争取缔结和约、反对军国主义的“一般性条约”而斗争。
    在西德，德国工人反对重新军国主义化委员会已发表声明，痛斥阿登纳凶手们的恐怖行为。西德许多城市都举行了抗议大会。
