    Reader Masses Appraising Literary and Artistic Works: An Example
    After reading Comrade Sun Qian's article "Sincere Gratitude" (published in "People's Literature," Nos. 3 and 4, 1952), I felt boundless joy. This article was written by Comrade Sun Qian to express his gratitude to the readers for providing valuable opinions on his screenplay, "When the Grapes Are Ripe."
    In order to point out that a merchant buying grapes would never praise the quality of the goods in front of the seller, our soldier Comrade Wu Xingyu wrote a letter and enthusiastically offered his opinion. In order to add the word "Party" before "branch secretary," worker Comrade Xu Zonghuan provided his opinion while sick. Regarding the inappropriateness of "price in foreign currency" and the title "Widow Zhou," railway worker Comrade Li Zhi and Feng Erzhen from Beijing suggested that "price in foreign currency" should be changed to "Renminbi" and "Widow Zhou" should be changed to "Auntie Zhou."...
    This shows how seriously our readers, especially worker, peasant, and soldier readers, treat the people's cultural and artistic endeavors. New China's literary and artistic workers, treat your creations seriously, for countless masses across the country are appraising your works!

    读者群众鉴定文艺作品的一例
    读了孙谦同志的文章《衷心的感激》（载《人民文学》一九五二年第三、四号）以后，我感到无限的欢快。这篇文章是孙谦同志为了感激读者对他的电影剧本《葡萄熟了的时候》提供了宝贵的意见而写的。
    为了指正收葡萄的商人绝不会在卖主的面前夸奖货色好，我们的战士吴兴宇同志写信热烈地提供了意见。为了“支部书记”上面应该加个“党”字，工人徐宗焕同志在病中提供了意见。为了“价洋”和“周寡妇”称号的不恰当，铁路工人李芝同志和北京的冯尔祯同志提出“价洋”应改为“人民币”，“周寡妇”应改为“周大妈”。……
    这说明了我们的读者们，特别是工农兵读者们，是怎样严肃地对待人民的文化艺术事业。新中国的文艺工作者们，严肃地对待你们的创作吧，全国无数的群众都在鉴定你们的作品呢！
