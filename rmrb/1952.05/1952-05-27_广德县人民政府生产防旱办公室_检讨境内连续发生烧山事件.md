    Self-Criticism Regarding Continuous Mountain Fire Incidents Within the County
    Editor: The People's Daily readers' letters column on April 14th published a letter from Comrades Chen Xinzhi and Wang Qi, criticizing the continuous mountain fire incidents in the mountainous areas of Guangde County. After seeing this letter, we immediately conducted an investigation. Comrades Chen and Wang believed that the cause of the mountain fire incidents was "mainly the ideological paralysis of the county and district leading cadres. They neither carried out in-depth publicity and education on forest protection work among the farmers, nor did they pay attention to the leadership of forest protection organizations." In fact, after receiving reports of mountain fires from various districts on April 4th, in addition to promptly reporting to the Wuhu Prefectural Production and Drought Prevention Office, we also urgently notified the entire county of the most serious mountain fire incident in the Sixth District. On the 9th, we issued an instruction to "Take Immediate Action to Prevent Mountain Fires," requiring all districts and villages to strengthen education on forest protection and fire prevention among the masses and to improve forest protection and fire prevention organizations. As for those who caused the mountain fire incidents, they have all received various appropriate punishments. In short, we attach importance to forest protection and fire prevention work, and we have always regarded forest protection work as the central task to be arranged in every production meeting and various representative meetings. But indeed, we have not yet deepened this work into the masses, and we still lack specific leadership over forest protection organizations. We also lack inspection after issuing instructions and arranging work, thus causing losses to national forest resources. Now, in addition to strengthening forest protection and fire prevention work, we also request the higher-level government to give us the appropriate punishment.

    广德县人民政府生产防旱办公室
    检讨境内连续发生烧山事件
    编辑同志：四月十四日人民日报读者来信栏刊登陈信之、王奇两同志的来信，批评广德县境内山林地带连续发生烧山事件；我们看到这封来信，当即进行检查。陈、王两同志认为造成烧山事件的原因“主要是这个县的县区领导干部思想麻痹。他们既没有向农民进行深入的关于护林工作的宣传教育，又忽视对护林组织的领导”。事实上，我们在四月四日接到各区烧山的报告后，除及时向芜湖专署生产防旱办公室报告外，并把其中最严重的六区烧山事件紧急通报全县。我们在九日发出“立即行动起来，防止烧山”的指示，要各区、村对群众加强护林防火的教育，并健全护林防火的组织。至于那些引起烧山事件的肇事者，都已受到了各种不同的应得的处分。总之，我们对护林防火工作是重视的，在每次生产会议及各种代表会议上都把护林工作当作中心工作布置。但的确，我们还没有把这一工作深入到群众中去，对护林组织还缺乏具体的领导，在发布指示、布置工作后又缺乏检查，因而使国家森林资源遭到损失。现在，我们除加强护林防火工作外，并请上级政府给我们以应得处分。
