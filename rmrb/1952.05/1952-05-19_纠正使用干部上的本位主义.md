Title: Correcting Departmentalism in the Use of Cadres

Concerning the issue of cadre utilization, I personally have some views that I would like to put forward for everyone's consideration.

I feel that some leading cadres exhibit departmentalist thinking when using cadres. For example, some university graduates who originally studied statistics and accounting, or physics and chemistry, are now engaged in work such as clerical duties, receiving and dispatching, and registration. They work very hard and achieve good results, but if they were sent to work in factories or to teach in secondary schools, they would play a much greater role. Clerical duties, receiving and dispatching, registration, or general administrative work cannot allow these specialized talents to leverage their strengths. However, some leading cadres simply feel that they are working well and are unwilling to let them go.

"Work needs" is the shield of the departmentalists. They only consider the work needs of their own department and do not look at the needs of the overall work. When higher authorities want to transfer cadres, the leaders of some organizations always transfer those with poorer work abilities or those with other problems.

Cadres have different opinions about this situation, but they dare not raise them. If they voice their opinions, they will be deemed to have "ideological problems." Labels such as not being at ease with their work, not starting from the work, and emphasizing personal interests will be placed on their heads. Of course, it is wrong to request a change of work for personal considerations such as one's own interests, position, treatment, and living conditions. However, if one knows what talents they have and what they can do well, why can't they voice their opinions? Because the democratic work style of some leading cadres is too poor, the cadres do not dare to speak up. Everyone says they will obey the organizational assignment and also criticizes themselves for being "uneasy," but in reality, they are still uneasy.

In response to these situations, I suggest strengthening the work of personnel organizations. The cadres of all units should be managed uniformly by this organization, and rational assignments should be made based on the work needs of each department and the qualifications of the cadres. It is not necessary for each unit to submit its own list of personnel to be transferred, to avoid them committing the mistake of departmentalism.

    纠正使用干部上的本位主义
    吴言
    关于干部的使用问题，我个人有些看法，想提出来和大家研究。
    我觉得，有些领导干部在使用干部上是有本位主义思想的。比如有些大学毕业生，原来学的是统计会计，或是物理、化学，现在却担任文书、收发、登记之类的工作。工作很努力，成绩很好；但是如果把他们派到工厂去工作，或到中等学校去教书，起的作用就会更大一些。文书、收发、登记或一般行政工作，不能使这些专门人才发挥他们的长处。但是某些领导干部只是觉得他们工作得很好，就不肯放走他们。
    “工作需要”是本位主义者的挡箭牌。他们只顾自己一个部门工作的需要，不从整个工作的需要来看。在上级要调动干部时，有些机关的领导者也都是把些工作能力较差的、或有其他问题的调出去了。
    干部对这种情形有不同的意见，但不敢提。如果提出意见，就会被认为“思想有问题”。不安心工作、不从工作出发、强调个人兴趣等“帽子”，都会给戴在头上。当然，为了自己的兴趣、地位、待遇、生活条件等个人打算而要求调动工作，是不对的。但是，如果他知道自己有什么才能，知道自己能做好什么，为什么不可以提出意见呢？因为某些领导干部的民主作风太差，干部也就不敢提。大家都说服从组织分配，也检讨了“不安心”，实际上还是不安心。
    针对这些情况，我建议加强人事机构的工作，各单位的干部都要由这个机构来统一掌握，根据各部门的工作需要，根据干部的条件作合理的分配。抽调工作人员不一定要由各单位自己提出名单，以免他们犯本位主义的毛病。
