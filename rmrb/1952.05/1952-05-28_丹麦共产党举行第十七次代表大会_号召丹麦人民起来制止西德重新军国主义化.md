Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 27th Dispatch from TASS: The Communist Party of Denmark held its seventeenth congress in Copenhagen from May 22nd to 25th. Two hundred and fifty delegates from party organizations across Denmark participated in the congress.

    The opening ceremony of the congress was presided over by Larsøn, Chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark. In his opening speech, Larsøn provided a detailed analysis of the domestic political situation and the current international situation since the closure of the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of Denmark in May 1949. He pointed out the role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace and progress and the growth of progressive forces in the world; he expressed the Danish people's confidence and determination in the struggle, and paid tribute to the people of Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Spain who are engaged in heroic struggles, and paid tribute to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin.

    The congress listened to and discussed Larsøn's political report and the report on the party program by Jensøn, Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party of Denmark. In his political report, Larsøn pointed out: Denmark's participation in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has resulted in its becoming a subordinate country, with Denmark's economy and internal affairs being manipulated by foreign countries, and even its army being under foreign command; Danish territory has become a military base for the United States; at the same time, the living standards of the Danish people are declining day by day.

    The congress adopted a resolution against the remilitarization of West Germany and an appeal to the Danish people, calling on the people to rise up and stop the remilitarization of West Germany, to promote negotiations between the major powers based on the Soviet Union's proposals for a German peace treaty, and to denounce the Danish government for implementing an anti-people and traitorous policy.

    The congress elected the party's Central Executive Committee and other leading bodies, and closed on the 25th.

    丹麦共产党举行第十七次代表大会
    号召丹麦人民起来制止西德重新军国主义化
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：丹麦共产党于五月二十二日至二十五日在哥本哈根举行第十七次代表大会。参加大会的，有丹麦各地党组织的代表二百五十人。
    大会开幕式由丹麦共产党主席拉荪主持。拉荪在开幕词中详细分析了一九四九年五月丹麦共产党十六次代表大会闭会以来的国内政治局势和目前的国际情势。他指出苏联在争取和平与进步的斗争中所起的作用和世界进步力量的壮大；他表示了丹麦人民对斗争的信心和决心，并且向英勇斗争的朝鲜、越南、马来亚和西班牙等国人民致敬，向苏联共产党和斯大林同志致敬。
    大会听取并讨论了拉荪的政治报告和丹麦共产党副主席詹逊关于党纲的报告。拉荪在政治报告中指出：丹麦加入了北大西洋侵略集团，结果就沦为附属国的地位，丹麦的经济和内政都受外国操纵，甚至军队也得受外国指挥；丹麦的领土成为美国的军事基地；同时，丹麦人民的生活水平在一天天降低。
    大会通过了反对西德重新军国主义化的决议和告丹麦人民书，号召人民起来制止西德重新军国主义化，促使各大国以苏联关于对德和约的建议为基础进行谈判，并且斥责丹麦政府执行反人民的卖国政策。
    大会在选出了党的中央执行委员会及其他领导机构后，在二十五日闭幕。
