    Central Production Drought Prevention Office
    Notifies All Regions to Conduct In-Depth Inspection of Drought Prevention Work
    The Central Production Drought Prevention Office issued a notice on May 7th regarding a more in-depth campaign for drought prevention and resistance to ensure a bumper harvest.
    The notice stated: Since the mass drought prevention and resistance campaign began this spring across the country, significant progress has been made in farmland water conservancy construction in most areas, and the irrigated area and moisture-retaining area have greatly increased. However, during the inspection of farmland water conservancy spring repair projects in various regions, it was found that some canals could not draw water; some wells were dug in places where they were not needed; some wells were dug but were unusable; some reservoir dikes were not strong or the bottom of the reservoir leaked, and the general water storage capacity was not large. The Central Production Drought Prevention Office believes that, based on past experience, drought disasters easily occur every summer. Therefore, all regions must prevent complacency from growing due to abundant rainfall in the spring, and should make full use of the favorable conditions of smooth spring sowing and less labor constraints to further deepen the drought prevention and resistance campaign, seize the time, and complete the farmland water conservancy construction plan as early as possible, in order to confidently overcome the possible summer drought and ensure a bumper harvest of agricultural products. To this end, the Central Production Drought Prevention Office requires all regions to promptly study and implement the following measures:
    (1) All regions should immediately conduct a widespread and in-depth inspection of drought prevention work. People's governments at all levels must send personnel to conduct in-depth inspections of the extent to which water conservancy plans have been completed and the situation of irrigation water use, and mobilize farmers to universally inspect the engineering quality and actual effectiveness of all new and old drought prevention facilities. Through this inspection, all regions should quickly repair all canals, wells, and reservoirs that cannot achieve the intended irrigation effectiveness, so that they can fully play their role in resisting drought. Regions that have not completed the farmland water conservancy work plan should vigorously organize farmers to step up construction and strive to complete it all before the summer harvest.
    (2) The season for large-scale use of water in farmland is approaching, and all regions must strengthen irrigation management, organize farmers to use water rationally, expand the area of irrigation, and ensure that all kinds of crops receive timely irrigation. Irrigation areas should launch a water conservation campaign and establish model banners. Each province, special zone, and county should organize unified water distribution agencies or joint management agencies of interconnected channels according to the size of the rivers and canals, grasp the amount of water diverted from each channel, and distribute water according to the needs of the crops. In the southern pond and dam irrigation areas, attention should be paid to timely water storage, and in times of water shortage, joint water use by various ponds and dams should be promoted. All regions should organize farmers to use well water and waterwheels jointly as much as possible to maximize irrigation effectiveness.
    (3) Individual drought-stricken areas should quickly mobilize farmers to carry water for sowing and watering to protect seedlings. Areas with excessive rainfall should promptly lead farmers to drain standing water and rush to plant crops.

    中央生产防旱办公室
    通知各地深入检查防旱工作
    中央生产防旱办公室五月七日发出关于更深入地开展防旱抗旱运动，保证农业丰收的通知。
    通知中说：今春全国各地群众性的防旱抗旱运动开展以来，大部地区兴修农田水利已有显著成绩，灌溉面积和保墒面积大大增加。但在各地对农田水利春修工程的检查中发现有些渠道不能上水；有些水井打在不需要打井的地方；有些水井打得不能用；有些水塘塘堤不牢或塘底漏水，一般蓄水量不大。中央生产防旱办公室认为：根据过去经验，夏季每易发生旱灾。因此，各地必须防止因春季多雨而滋长松懈情绪，应尽量利用春播顺利、人力不太忙迫的条件，进一步深入地开展防旱抗旱运动，抓紧时间，提早完成兴修农田水利计划，以期有把握地战胜可能发生的夏旱，保障农产丰收。为此，中央生产防旱办公室要求各地迅即研究执行下列几项办法：
    （一）各地应即普遍深入地检查防旱工作。各级人民政府必须层层派员深入检查水利计划完成的程度和灌溉用水情况，并发动农民普遍检查所有新旧防旱设施的工程质量及其实际效能。通过这次检查，各地应把一切不能达到应有灌溉效能的渠道、水井、塘坝等，迅速加以修整，使其充分发挥抗旱作用。凡未完成农田水利工作计划的地区，应大力组织农民加紧兴修，争取在夏收前全部完成。
    （二）目前农田大量用水的季节即到，各地必须加强灌溉管理工作，组织农民合理用水，扩大浇地面积，保证各种作物得到及时灌溉。灌溉区要开展爱水运动，树立模范旗帜。各省、专区、县应根据河渠的大小，分别组织统一分配水量的机构或相联渠道的联合管理机构，掌握各渠道的引水量，根据作物需要配水。南方塘坝灌区应注意及时蓄水，在缺水时期，应提倡各塘坝合作用水。各地应尽可能地组织农民合伙使用水井水车，以发挥最大的灌溉效能。
    （三）个别干旱地区要迅速动员农民担水下种，浇水保苗。雨水过多地区要及时领导农民排除积水，赶种庄稼。    （新华社）
