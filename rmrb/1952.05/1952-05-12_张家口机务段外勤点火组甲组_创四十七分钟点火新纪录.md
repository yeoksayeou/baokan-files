    Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot's Outside Fire-Lighting Group A
    Sets New Record of 47 Minutes for Fire-Lighting

    To the Editor: Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot's Outside Fire-Lighting Group B has repeatedly set four new fire-lighting records. Under the influence of Group B, Group A workers Li Wandong and two others were determined to catch up. During their off-duty time, they humbly learned the fire-lighting methods of Group B. On April 24th, the dispatching office ordered the urgent fire-lighting of locomotive 冖丂1-511. The three of them accepted this task and said in unison, "It's up to us today!" Deputy Director Liu Wanxuan and other workers from Group A participated in the guidance. They started the fire at 15:47, with an initial boiler temperature of 22 degrees. They started igniting at 16:08, and by 16:34, the steam pressure had reached 3 kilograms, completing the task in 47 minutes. This new record is eight minutes shorter than Group B's highest record of 55 minutes, exceeding the bureau's set standard by 7.7 times, and creating a new fire-lighting record for the Tianjin Railway Administration.
