    Reading Groups Widely Developed Among Beijing Citizens
    Editor: Citizen reading groups in various districts of Beijing have become a powerful weapon for publicizing current events and policies to the people and promoting central tasks. At the same time, they have become the main base for citizen propaganda team members to carry out propaganda activities. After the reading work was carried out, the masses' awareness was significantly improved. The Guimenguan reading group in the Third District is one of these reading groups. The group conducted propaganda on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns to the masses, and the masses were extremely indignant at the crimes of unscrupulous merchants harming the volunteer army. After hearing the news about opposing bribery and opposing acceptance of bribery, Xue Shudi, a member of the group, pretended to be ill and did not attend the second reading session. Wang Yutian, the head of the reading group, suspected that she had a problem, so he patiently persuaded and mobilized her. Later, during the reading, she publicly confessed to evading taxes on the sale of houses, bribing tax bureau cadres, and her husband's acceptance of bribes, which led others to confess their problems as well. One vendor confessed to evading more than 30 million yuan in taxes, and a stall owner confessed to evading more than 4 million yuan in taxes.
    These reading groups were consolidated through the efforts of their负责人 (fù zé rén) and all the readers, overcoming many difficulties. When the Xiaoshuiche Hutong reading group in the Second District was first established, few people came to listen to the reading because they felt it was a waste of time. The readers repeatedly mobilized people and tried to improve the content and methods of reading. Because most of the listeners were women, they selected more materials about women and asked everyone to discuss them after reading. In this way, the number of listeners gradually increased. In order to meet the needs of the masses, many reading groups are not limited to reading activities. The Qianyizi Hutong reading group in the First District is coordinated with literacy work, studying culture for one hour and reading newspapers for one hour each time. Radio listening groups are organized on the basis of reading groups. Some reading groups also hold commemorative meetings on commemorative festivals. As the content of the reading group activities became richer, the masses loved the reading groups even more.
    Another important reason why reading groups can be consolidated is that the负责人 (fù zé rén) and readers of the reading groups can persevere to the end. No matter how busy they are, they never give up reading, so that reading activities can continue regardless of wind or rain; even if there are occasional interruptions, they can be restored immediately.
    According to the situation of the reading groups in the First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth Districts, the following aspects of work must be strengthened in the future: First, the existing reading groups should be consolidated, and more reading groups should be established on the basis of voluntary participation of the masses. The reading time of the newly established reading groups should not be too long, and the number of times should not be too many. Second, the reading groups should be combined with the work of the citizen propaganda teams, as part of the work of the propaganda teams, and the backbone propaganda members of the citizen propaganda teams should serve as the负责人 (fù zé rén) or readers of the reading groups. A reading committee should be established under the citizen propaganda team to be responsible for guiding the reading work. Cultural centers and newspaper and periodical reading rooms in various districts should help them in their work. Third, strengthen the leadership of reading work: the reading committee should point out the key points of reading, exchange reading experience, and pay attention to enriching the content of the reading group activities. Fourth, each public security police station should strengthen the leadership of the reading groups in its jurisdiction. Lü Yin

### 北京市民读报组普遍发展

    北京市民读报组普遍发展
    编辑同志：北京市城内各区市民的读报组，已经成为向人民群众宣传时事、政策，推动中心工作的有力的武器，它同时成为市民宣传队员进行宣传活动的主要基地。读报工作开展后，群众的觉悟有了显著的提高。三区贵门关读报小组，就是这些读报组中的一个。该组向群众进行了“三反”“五反”的宣传，群众对奸商暗害志愿军的罪行愤慨万分。组员薛书第听了反行贿、反受贿的消息后，第二次读报时就装病不到。读报组负责人王玉田怀疑她有问题，就向她耐心地说服动员。以后，她在读报时当众交代了卖房漏税，贿赂税局干部和她丈夫受贿等问题，因而带动别人也交代了问题。有个商贩坦白漏税三千多万元，一个摆车摊的坦白漏税四百多万元。
    这些读报组都是经过它的负责人和所有读报员的努力，克服了许多困难巩固下来的。二区小水车胡同读报组在初建立时，听报的人嫌耽误时间，来的很少。读报的人一面反覆地作动员，一面想法改进读报的内容和方法。因为听报的人多半是妇女，他们就多选读有关妇女的材料，读后再让大家讨论。这样，听报的人就日渐增多了。为了适应群众的需要，许多读报组并不局限于读报活动。一区前椅子胡同读报组是和识字工作配合进行的，每次学习一小时文化，读一小时报。并以读报组为基础组织广播收听组。有的读报组遇有纪念节日还举行纪念会。读报组活动的内容丰富了，群众也就更加热爱读报组了。
    读报组能够巩固的另一个重要原因，是读报组的负责人和读报员能够坚持到底。他们不论事情多么忙，从来不放弃读报，因而使读报活动能够风雨无阻，坚持不断；偶有停顿，也能立即恢复。
    根据一、二、四、五等区读报组的情况看来，今后必须加强这几方面的工作：一、应巩固已有的读报组，并在群众自愿的基础上建立更多的读报组。新建的读报组读报时间不应过长，次数不要太多。二、读报组应该和市民宣传队的工作结合起来，作为宣传队工作的一部分，由市民宣传队中的骨干宣传员担任读报组负责人或读报员。市民宣传队下边成立读报委员会，负责指导读报工作。各区文化馆、书报阅览室应该帮助他们工作。三、加强读报工作的领导：由读报委员会指出读报重点，交流读报经验，并注意丰富读报组的活动内容。四、各公安派出所应对所辖区内读报组加强领导。　吕荫
