Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. Today, our Chief Liaison Officer to the Korean armistice negotiations, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, met with the U.S. Chief Liaison Officer, Kenney, to protest the fact that U.S. military aircraft repeatedly violated the agreement by intruding into the airspace of the conference area on May 9th and 10th. Between 8:33 a.m. and 8:47 a.m. on May 9th, U.S. military aircraft intruded into the airspace over the Panmunjom conference area. At 9:33 a.m. on the 10th, U.S. military aircraft once again intruded into the airspace of the conference area. Colonel Zhang Chunshan demanded that the U.S. side strictly restrain U.S. Air Force personnel from allowing similar incidents to occur again. Kenney, as in previous instances of U.S. violations of the agreement, merely replied that they were "investigating" this violation.

    美机一再侵入会场区上空
    我联络官对美方提出抗议
    【新华社开城十日电】今日朝鲜停战谈判的我方首席联络官张春山上校和美方首席联络官肯尼会晤，就五月九日和十日两天内，美方军用飞机一再违反协议，侵入会场区上空一事，向美方提出抗议。五月九日上午八时三十三分到八时四十七分之间，美方军用飞机侵入板门店会场区上空。十日上午九时三十三分美方军用飞机又一次侵入会场区上空。张春山上校要求美方严格约束美方空军人员不再发生类似事件。肯尼也像历次美方违反协议时一样，仅仅答称，他们正在对这一违反协议事件“进行调查”。
