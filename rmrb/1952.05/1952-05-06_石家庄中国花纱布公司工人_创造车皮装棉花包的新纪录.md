    Workers of Shijiazhuang China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company
    Create New Record for Loading Cotton Bales in a Wagon
    Comrade Editor: Before "May Day," workers of the Shijiazhuang China Cotton Yarn Cloth Company created a new record of loading 151 cotton bales per wagon.
    Before "May Day," the workers of this company put forward the slogan of commemorating "May Day" with practical actions and actively sought ways to increase production and practice economy. Worker Xue Xiangyuan devoted himself to researching and improving the method of loading cotton onto wagons. On April 24th, he, Comrade Zhao from the railway freight office, and loading and unloading workers conducted an experiment, loading 151 cotton bales into a standard 30-ton wagon without exceeding the railway bureau's regulations on the height and width of the wagon's load. The loading method was as follows: First layer, small faces of the bales facing up, double-touching ends in two rows, 20 bales per row, totaling 40 bales; the second layer was the same as the first layer; third layer, large faces of the bales facing up, double-touching ends laid flat in two rows, 12 bales per row, totaling 24 bales; the fourth layer was the same as the third layer; fifth layer, large faces of the bales facing up, laid flat in three rows, 7 bales per row, totaling 21 bales, the gaps in the middle can be filled with two bales, totaling 23 bales. The batch of cotton bales was neatly packaged, of uniform size, and the cotton bales were neither too loose nor too tight. This shows that: to increase freight load capacity, it is necessary to improve loading technology on the one hand, and on the other hand, packaging must also be standardized.

    石家庄中国花纱布公司工人
    创造车皮装棉花包的新纪录
    编辑同志：石家庄中国花纱布公司工人，“五一”前创造了每车皮装一百五十一包棉花的新纪录。
    “五一”以前，这个公司的工人提出以实际行动纪念“五一”的口号，都积极想法增产节约。工人薛香元用心研究改进棉花装车法。四月二十四日，他和铁路货运室的赵同志及装卸工人进行实验，在一个三十吨的标准车皮里装了一百五十一包棉花，并没有超出铁路局对车皮载货高度和宽度的规定。它的装法是：第一层，包的小面向上，双碰头装两行，每行二十包，共计四十包；第二层与第一层相同；第三层，包的大面向上，双碰头平装两行，每行十二包，共计二十四包；第四层与第三层相同；第五层，包的大面向上，顺着平放三行，每行七包，可装二十一包，当中留的空隙处可装两包，共计二十三包。那批棉花包装整齐，规格一致，棉包无过松过紧现象。这说明了：要提高货运载重量，一方面必须改进装车技术，另方面包装也必须规格化。
