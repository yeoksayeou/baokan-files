    Wheat Aphid Plague in Henan Plain, Shanxi and Other Places Basically Eliminated
    Red Spider and Other Pests Continuing to Harm Wheat Seedlings Should Continue to be Eradicated

    The wheat aphid, which seriously harmed wheat seedlings in Henan, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other places, has been basically eliminated through the active eradication efforts of the broad masses, and the affected wheat seedlings have recovered vigorously.

    The rapid elimination of this wheat aphid plague once again proves that "man can conquer nature." Wheat aphids in wheat fields in Weinan, Shaanxi Province and other places were wiped out in mid-April. At the height of the wheat aphid infestation in Henan Province, it spread to 52 counties in nine special districts. Under the leadership of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Government, the broad masses of farmers carried out an insect eradication campaign, adopting various methods to eliminate the pests, and have basically eliminated the pests in most areas. Inspections are currently underway to ensure complete and thorough elimination. In Pingyuan Province, approximately seven million mu of wheat fields were affected by wheat aphids, spreading to 35 counties; the aphid plague in these areas has also been largely eradicated. The aphid plague in the wheat fields of the Yuncheng and Linfen special districts in Shanxi Province was originally very serious; after eradication efforts, it has also been basically eliminated. Recently, red spiders have been discovered, and vigorous efforts are being made to eradicate them.

    The key reason for the rapid elimination of the wheat aphid plague is that the Party committees and People's Governments at all levels concentrated their efforts to mobilize and organize the masses to promptly capture and eradicate the pests. After the outbreak of the insect plague in various places, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Government issued emergency notices, requiring all localities to make pest eradication the central task and to lead farmers to vigorously eradicate the pests. Provincial-level agencies also drew upon cadres, experts, and more than 1,600 students from the Agricultural College of Henan University, who went to various places to participate in insect capture and treatment work. The Provincial People's Government also supplied more than 9,000 sprayers, 150 powder sprayers, and a large number of cotton oil soap, "666" insecticide powder, and other materials to various places. In Pingyuan Province, the Huxi and Anyang special districts alone dispatched more than 1,200 cadres to participate in this work. After insect pests were discovered in counties such as Jie and Yi in Shanxi Province, the Yuncheng Commissioner's Office immediately dispatched 150 administrative cadres and technical personnel to various places to mobilize the masses to eradicate the pests. The Yuncheng Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative transported 70,000 jin of cotton aphid soap and more than 200 sprayers, which were in stock, to the affected counties overnight for application. In the areas most severely affected by insect pests, leading cadres at all levels personally went to the affected areas to specifically lead the masses in eradication efforts. For example, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central South Region personally went to Luoyang, Henan and other places to inspect insect control work. The Deputy County Head of Queshan County, Henan Province, personally led the masses to rescue more than 1,000 mu of affected wheat fields. After conducting investigations in the affected areas, Liu Gang, Secretary of the Xinxiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Pingyuan Province, and Commissioner Yu Jian, etc., sent urgent telegrams to various counties overnight to deploy insect eradication work. Some areas promptly commended cadres who actively led the masses in insect eradication, while cadres who failed to effectively lead the masses in eradication were given the punishment they deserved.

    Secondly, all localities fully mobilized the masses, making wheat aphid eradication a mass movement. In the course of pest eradication, Nanyang Special District in Henan Province mobilized 1.64 million people to participate, capturing more than 167,000 jin of wheat aphids and other pests, and protecting more than 2.8 million mu of wheat fields. In Xin'an County, Luoyang Special District, more than 924,000 people participated in insect eradication, capturing more than 140,000 jin of insects. In Huxi and other six special districts of Pingyuan Province, 2 million farmers participated in pest eradication. In Jie County, Shanxi, at the beginning of the insect eradication movement, on April 4th and 5th alone, more than 47,000 men and women (accounting for two-thirds of the county's population) were mobilized, wiping out the aphid plague on more than 40,000 mu of wheat fields. After being mobilized, the masses in some areas also launched competitions with each other. Twenty women in the Ma Xiangzhi Mutual Aid Group in Mi County, Zhengzhou Special District, Henan Province, promoted the insect eradication campaign among farmers in nearby districts while fighting the insects, promoting the development of insect eradication competitions. All levels of insect eradication organizations (insect eradication teams, insect eradication groups) in various villages in Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, launched competitions to compare efficiency and discipline. In the course of mobilizing the masses to participate in the insect eradication movement, all localities extensively carried out publicity for insect eradication and wheat protection, ensuring a bumper harvest this year, and improving the political consciousness of the masses and their confidence in fighting against insect pests.

    Thirdly, all localities fully utilized the wisdom of the masses in carrying out insect eradication, adopting a variety of insect control methods. In the course of eradicating wheat aphids, the masses in Luoyang, Henan and other places adopted the "Mulberry Basket Pushing Method" (binding a dustpan to a mulberry branch, pushing it over the wheat ridges, three ridges at a time, pushing as fast as possible), the "Mat Pulling Method" (dipping a mat in water, back side up, with one person pulling the mat forward with a rope), and the "Sweeping Off Method" (using a broom to sweep the wheat aphids into a basin). In Xin'an County, District 1, Henan Province, using the above three methods to eradicate insects, more than 10,000 jin of aphids were captured in one day on April 3rd. Xi Wang and other villages in District 3 of Jie County, Shanxi Province, created the "Sweeping and Rubbing Method" (sweeping with a broom while rubbing the insects to death with their feet or burying the swept-off wheat aphids in the soil with a hoe). Using this method, more than 980 people swept more than 670 mu of wheat fields in two hours, wiping out more than 70% of the wheat aphids. In addition, some areas also adopted the method of horizontally binding grass to a hoe, pushing it forward when hoeing to knock the wheat aphids to the ground, then pulling the hoe to bury the fallen wheat aphids, and using thin boards to make small wooden rakes, coating the rakes with sticky mud, dragging them along the wheat to stick the aphids off the wheat leaves. In the course of insect eradication, the masses in various localities also made full use of various effective folk remedies to make up for the shortage of insect control agents. For example, farmers in Linjin County, Shanxi Province, extensively used lime tobacco water and plant ash tobacco water in insect eradication; farmers in Heilongjiang in the Northeast Region and some areas in North China also used fishy fish soup (water used to wash fish or crushing small fish and putting them in water) to spray and eradicate aphids.

    Although the wheat aphids in the above-mentioned wheat fields have been basically eliminated or stopped from developing, red spiders and other insect pests in wheat fields in some areas are still continuing to harm them. The leading departments in various localities should learn from the experience of eradicating aphids, continue to vigorously eradicate pests in areas where red spiders have been discovered, and diligently inspect areas where they have not been discovered, closely monitoring the occurrence of insect pests.

    河南平原山西等地麦蚜虫害基本扑灭
    继续为害麦苗的红蜘蛛等虫害应继续扑打干净
    河南、平原、山西、陕西等地发现严重危害麦苗的麦蚜虫，经过广大群众积极除治，已基本扑灭，受害的麦苗已恢复健旺。
    这次麦蚜虫的被迅速扑灭，再一次证明了“人定胜天”。陕西省渭南等地麦田的麦蚜虫，已在四月中旬被消灭干净。河南省麦蚜最严重时，曾蔓延到九个专区的五十二个县。在中共河南省委和河南省人民政府领导下，广大农民群众进行了除虫竞赛，采用各种办法除治，已把大部地区的害虫基本消灭。目前正在进行检查，以便最后彻底消灭。平原省遭麦蚜虫为害的麦田约有七百万亩，蔓延的地区有三十五个县；这些地区的蚜害，也已大部扑灭。山西省运城、临汾两专区麦田中的蚜害原来是很严重的；经过除治以后也已基本上扑灭。最近又发现了红蜘蛛，正在大力除治中。
    这次麦蚜虫发生后，中共各级党委、人民政府集中力量发动组织群众及时捕打，是麦蚜虫被迅速扑灭的基本原因。中共河南省委和河南省人民政府在各地发生虫害后就发出紧急通知，要求各地将捕灭虫害作为中心任务，领导农民大力除治。省级各机关并抽调了干部、专家、河南大学农学院学员一千六百多人分赴各地参加捕虫、治虫工作。省人民政府还供应各地喷雾器九千多架，喷粉器一百五十架和大批棉油皂、“六六六”杀虫粉等。平原省仅湖西、安阳两个专区就抽调了干部一千二百多人参加这个工作。山西省解县、猗氏等发现虫害后，运城专员公署即抽派行政干部和技术人员一百五十人分赴各地发动群众除虫。运城专区供销合作总社把所存的棉蚜皂七万斤、喷雾器二百多部连夜运往各遭受虫害的县份应用。在虫害最严重的地区，各级领导干部都亲临虫患地区，具体领导群众除治。如中南区农林部部长曾亲到河南洛阳等地检查治虫工作。河南省确山县副县长亲自领导群众抢救受害麦田一千多亩。中共平原省新乡地委书记刘刚、专员于健等，在亲到虫害区调查后，连夜分电各县布置除虫工作。有的地区对积极领导群众除虫的干部及时进行了表扬，对领导群众除治不力的干部，则给予应得的处分。
    其次是各地充分发动了群众，使除治麦蚜成为一个广大群众的运动。河南省南阳专区在除治虫害中动员了一百六十四万人参加，共捕麦蚜等害虫十六万七千多斤，防护麦田二百八十多万亩。洛阳专区新安县曾有九十二万四千多人参加除虫，共捕虫十四万多斤。平原省湖西等六个专区参加灭虫的农民有二百万人。山西解县在除虫运动开始时，仅四月四、五两日就出动男女群众四万七千多人（占全县人口三分之二），扑灭了四万多亩麦田的蚜害。有的地区的群众在发动起来以后并且相互展开竞赛。河南省郑州专区密县马香芝互助组的二十个妇女，一面打虫一面宣传，推动了附近两个区的农民展开除虫竞赛。山西新绛县各村的各级除虫组织（除虫队、除虫组）之间都展开比效率、比纪律的竞赛。各地在发动群众参加除虫运动中，广泛地展开除虫护麦，保证今年丰产的宣传，提高了群众的政治觉悟和向虫害作斗争的信心。
    再次是各地在进行除虫中充分发挥群众的智慧，采用了多种多样的治虫办法。河南省洛阳等地群众在除治麦蚜中采用了“桑?推法”（桑?上绑簸箕，在麦垅上推，一次三垅，推的越快越好）、“席拉法”（席上沾水，背面向上，一人用绳拉席前跑）和“扫落法”（用扫帚把麦蚜扫在盆内）。河南省新安县一区在采用上述三种办法除虫，四月三日一天中就捕蚜虫一万多斤。山西解县三区西王等村创造了“扫搓法”（一边用扫帚扫，一边用脚把虫搓死或用锄把扫下的麦蚜埋在土里），他们用这个办法，九百八十多人在两小时内扫了六百七十多亩麦田，扑灭了百分之七十以上的麦蚜。此外有的地区还采用锄上横绑草把，在锄地时先向前推动把麦蚜打落在地上，随后拉锄把落下的麦蚜埋住和用薄板制成小形木耙，在耙上涂满黏性大的稀泥顺麦拖拉，把麦叶上的蚜虫黏下等办法。各地群众在除治虫害中还充分利用各种确实有效的土药，以弥补治虫药剂的不足。如山西省临晋县农民在除虫中曾大量利用石灰烟叶水和草木灰烟叶水；东北区黑龙江和华北区若干地区的农民也有用腥鱼汤（洗鱼的水或把小鱼压碎放在水里）喷洒除治蚜虫的。
    上述各地麦田中的麦蚜虽已基本消灭或停止发展，但若干地区麦田中的红蜘蛛等虫害还在继续为害，各地领导部门应吸取除治蚜害的经验，在已发现红蜘蛛地区继续大力扑杀；在没有发现地区应勤于检查，严密注视虫害的发生。
