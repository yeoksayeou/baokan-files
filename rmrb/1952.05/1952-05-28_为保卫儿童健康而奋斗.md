    Strive to Protect Children's Health
    Fu Lianzhang, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children

    Children are the flowers of humanity, the masters of the future beautiful society, and the successors to the country's great construction undertaking. The government and people of New China have given great care and love to children. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the vigorous development of national economic and cultural construction, and the gradual improvement of people's living conditions have opened up a happy and bright future for our country, and have also created good conditions for the lives and growth of children. Health is the most important issue for children. "Protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children" is clearly stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The health department and other relevant departments have taken many specific measures based on this provision and have achieved remarkable results. For example, the infant mortality rate in old China was alarming, with an average annual infant mortality rate within one year reaching 200 per thousand. This was a serious loss to the country and the nation. Since liberation, due to the large-scale establishment of maternal and child health stations and midwifery stations, the large-scale training and transformation of old midwives, and the training of new midwifery and health personnel, the infant mortality rate has been significantly reduced. Due to the increase in general hospital outpatient units, medical conditions for sick children have also improved. There has also been an increase in independent children's hospitals and pediatric beds. In terms of children's immunization, vaccinations and injections have been carried out for several of the most common acute infectious diseases. More than 100 million children have now been vaccinated against smallpox, more than 1.16 million children have been vaccinated with BCG, and more than 1.886 million children have been injected with diphtheria vaccine. Vigorous prevention and control measures have also been taken for measles and kala-azar, greatly reducing the threat of these diseases to children's health. In the past two years, school health work has been carried out throughout the country, and school health committees have been established in major cities, mobilizing a large number of doctors to conduct health check-ups and correct defects for children, which has greatly helped children's health and development.

    The children's care and education cause has developed even more rapidly. According to statistics from 1951, there were 18,940 various types of childcare institutions (including nurseries, kindergartens, kindergartens, etc.), accommodating a total of 578,988 children. In particular, seasonal nurseries in rural areas and nurseries in industrial and mining areas have developed the fastest. This not only allows many mothers to participate in production and other construction work with peace of mind, but also provides children with reasonable health care.

    The improvement of family environment has also brought obvious happiness to children. The living standards of the broad masses of workers and peasants have improved, and their views and relationships with children have also improved. Children are no longer a burden and "whipping boy" for their parents as they were in the old society, but have become a factor in family happiness. Parents have the ability and mood to care for their children and give them the greatest affection, which is directly related to the children's health and development. When we see healthy and lively New China children everywhere, we cannot help but cheer for the future of our motherland.

    Of course, our work is only the beginning, and it is still far from the objective needs and our ideals. We must make the greatest efforts to carry out children's health care and education work, strengthen children's disease prevention and medical care, health check-ups, health publicity and education, improve nutrition, and correct defects, and vigorously develop children's care and education cause, so as to further improve the health level of our children and lay a solid foundation for their learning and future work.

    To do a good job in children's health care and education, efforts from all aspects are needed, especially the close cooperation and joint efforts of mothers, childcare workers, medical personnel, and children's education workers.

    There is no doubt that mothers love their children, but a few mothers have the idea of ​​not wanting to take care of their children because they are afraid of trouble or as an excuse to hinder work and study, which hinders careful care of their children. Raising children is the mothers' inescapable responsibility (fathers also have the same responsibility). We hope that there can be more nurseries, so that more mothers can participate in work without hindering the raising of their children. But if the conditions are not available and the mother needs to raise the child herself, we should regard this as a work as important as other work, promote the spirit of maternal love, and take good care of the child. The broad masses of working women, on the one hand, participate in production, and on the other hand, take care of their children. Their spirit is worth learning. On the other hand, over-spoiling children will have a bad influence on them, which we must also prevent.

    Comrades who are engaged in childcare work should have the spirit of maternal love, and should treat other people's children as their own children, and should treat them as the most precious property of the motherland. Nurturing the country's seedlings so that they can grow up comfortably and healthily is a glorious and great task. Childcare work is a specialized knowledge. Childcare workers should have the virtues of mothers, doctors, and teachers and certain professional knowledge. We should give childcare workers the respect they deserve, and we also hope that childcare workers can work with peace of mind, study their business, and take better care of their children.

    Medical workers have a direct responsibility for children's health and should also have "maternal love." We have done a lot of work in children's health care. We must especially emphasize the care and patience in our work, be good at figuring out children's psychology, and improve our work effectiveness. During this year's International Children's Day, medical staff in various places should actively participate in the publicity and education of disease prevention, appropriately promote parenting methods, and actively participate in children's health check-ups and defect correction work according to the instructions of the Central Ministry of Health.

    In addition to physical health, children also need psychological health and ideological health, which requires children's education workers to take more responsibility. The educational policy for children in New China is imbued with the spirit of democracy and science. The society of New China is clearing away the filth of the old society, and the families of New China are harmonious and happy. These are all favorable conditions for cultivating children's healthy psychology and healthy thinking. Children's education workers should conduct education according to the characteristics of children and imbued with the greatest spirit of love for children to cultivate children of New China into a brand new generation. Therefore, children's education workers should also have "maternal love."

    When we joyfully celebrate "June 1st" International Children's Day in liberated China, we have not forgotten that children in capitalist countries and colonial and dependent countries are suffering from the tragic fate of hunger, ignorance, terror, and death. We will never forget the heinous crimes of US imperialism in launching bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people, attempting to massively slaughter peaceful people and lovely children. Therefore, defending children and defending peace are inseparable. To defend children, we must defend peace. We must first oppose the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism expanding its arms race and waging wars of aggression, and oppose the use of bacteriological weapons and atomic weapons. The International Conference for the Defence of Children held in Vienna on April 12 has issued a just call on behalf of millions of people in sixty-one countries who care about the basic rights of children. We fully support the various resolutions of the conference and will wage unremitting struggle to realize these resolutions. We believe that as long as the people of the world unite and take action, our solemn ideals will surely be realized, and the sinister ambitions of the warmongers will inevitably be completely defeated.

    为保卫儿童健康而奋斗
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会副主席    傅连暲
    儿童是人类的花朵，是未来美好社会的主人，是国家伟大建设事业的继承者。新中国的政府和人民，对儿童是给予了极大的关怀和爱护的。中华人民共和国成立以来，国家经济建设、文化建设的蓬勃开展，人民生活状况的逐步改善，给我们的国家开辟了幸福、美好的前途，也给儿童们的生活和成长创造了良好的条件。健康问题是儿童首关重要的问题，“保护母亲、婴儿和儿童的健康”，这在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领中已有明文规定，卫生部门及其他有关部门即根据这一规定采取了许多具体的措施，获得了显著的成绩。比如旧中国的婴儿死亡率是惊人的，每年一岁以内的婴儿死亡率平均达千分之二百，这对国家和民族实在是严重的损失。解放以后由于妇幼保健站、接生站的大量成立，旧产婆的大量训练改造，和新的助产、保健人员的培养，使婴儿死亡率显著减低。由于普通医院门诊单位的增加，病儿的医疗条件也提高了。单独的儿童医院和儿科病床也有增加。在儿童防疫方面对几种最普遍的急性传染病，都进行了预防接种和注射。现已有一亿以上的儿童接种了牛痘，一百一十六万多的儿童接种了卡介苗，一百八十八万六千多的儿童进行了白喉预防注射。对麻疹及黑热病也大力进行了防治，大大减轻了这些疾病对儿童健康的威胁。两年来全国各地都在开展学校卫生工作，各大城市中都成立了学校卫生委员会，动员了大批医师为儿童作健康检查和缺点矫治，对儿童的健康和发育帮助很大。
    儿童保育事业更有飞速的发展。据一九五一年统计，各种类型的保育机构已有一万八千九百四十处（包括托儿所、幼儿园、保育院、幼稚园等），收容儿童共五十七万八千九百八十八人。尤以农忙托儿所和工矿托儿所发展最快。不但使许多母亲可以安心地参加生产及其他建设工作，也使儿童们得到了合理的健康照顾。
    家庭环境的改善，给儿童带来的幸福也是很明显的。广大的工农劳动人民生活改善了，对儿童的看法和关系也有所改善，儿童已经不是像旧社会那样成为父母的累赘和“出气筒”，而成了家庭幸福的因素。父母们有能力有心情来关怀自己的儿童，给以最大的抚爱，这对儿童的健康和发育是有直接联带关系的。当我们到处看到一个个一群群健康活泼的新中国儿童的时候，我们不禁为我们祖国的前途欢呼。
    当然，我们的工作还只是开端，离客观的需要和我们的理想还很远。我们还要尽最大的努力来开展儿童保健、保育工作，加强儿童疾病的预防医疗、健康检查、卫生宣传教育、改善营养及缺点矫治等工作，并大力发展儿童保育事业，使我们的儿童健康水平更加提高，给他们从事学习和将来工作打下坚实的基础。
    要把儿童保健、保育工作做好，需要各方面的努力，特别需要母亲们、保育人员、医务人员、儿童教育工作者等亲密合作，共同努力。
    毫无疑问，母亲们都是热爱自己的孩子的，但是有少数的母亲因为怕麻烦或以妨碍工作学习为辞而有不愿带孩子的想法，这就妨碍对孩子的细心照顾。抚育儿童是母亲们义不容辞的责任（父亲也同样有责任），我们希望能够有更多的托儿所，可以使更多母亲能够参加工作，而又不妨碍孩子的抚育。但如果条件不具备而需由母亲自己抚养时，我们应该把这当做和其他工作同样重要的工作，发扬母爱的精神，把孩子带好。广大工农劳动妇女，一方面参加生产，同时又要带孩子，她们的精神是值得学习的。另方面对孩子的溺爱会给孩子以不良影响，我们也要防止。
    作保育工作的同志，应该具有母爱的精神，应该把旁人的孩子当作自己的孩子来看待，更应该把他们当作祖国最宝贵的财产来看待。抚育国家的幼苗，使他们能够安适而健全地成长，这一工作是光荣而伟大的。保育工作是一种专门的学问。保育工作者应该兼备母亲、医生和教师的美德和一定的业务知识。我们应该给保育工作者以应有的尊敬，也希望保育工作者能够安心工作，钻研业务，把孩子保育得更好。
    医务工作同志们，对儿童健康负有直接的责任，同样应该有“母爱”。我们曾经在儿童保健方面作了许多的工作，我们要特别强调工作中的细心和耐心，要善于揣摩儿童的心理，提高我们的工作效果。今年的国际儿童节，各地医务人员应该根据中央卫生部的指示，积极参加预防疾病的宣传教育工作，并适当推广育儿法，和积极参加儿童健康检查和缺点矫治工作。
    儿童除了身体健康之外，还需要心理健康、思想健康，这就需要儿童教育工作者负更多的责任。新中国的儿童教育方针是贯注了民主和科学的精神的，新中国的社会正在清除旧社会的污毒，新中国的家庭是和睦而幸福的，这都是培养儿童健康心理和健康思想的有利条件。儿童教育工作者应该根据儿童的特点，并贯注最大的热爱儿童的精神，来进行教育，把新中国的儿童培养成为崭新的一代。所以儿童教育工作者也应有“母爱”。
    当我们在解放了的中国来欢欣鼓舞地纪念“六一”国际儿童节的时候，我们没有忘记在资本主义国家及殖民地和附属国国家内的儿童们正遭遇着饥饿、愚昧、恐怖、死亡的可悲命运。我们更不会忘记美帝国主义向中朝人民发动了细菌战、妄图大规模地屠杀和平人民和可爱儿童的滔天罪行。因此保卫儿童和保卫和平是不可分割的，要保卫儿童就必须保卫和平。我们首先要反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团扩军备战和进行掠夺战争，反对使用细菌武器和原子武器。四月十二日在维也纳召开的国际保卫儿童大会，已代表了六十一个国家千百万关心儿童基本权利的人们发出了正义的呼声。我们完全拥护该会的各项决议，并为实现这些决议而进行坚持不懈的斗争。我们相信：只要全世界人民团结起来，行动起来，我们庄严的理想就一定可以实现，战争贩子的罪恶野心就必然要彻底失败。
