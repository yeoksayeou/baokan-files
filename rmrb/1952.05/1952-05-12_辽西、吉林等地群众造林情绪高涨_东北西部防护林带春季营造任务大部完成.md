    High Enthusiasm for Afforestation Among the Masses in Western Liaoning and Jilin
    Spring Afforestation Task of the Western Northeast Shelterbelt Largely Completed
    The spring afforestation task of the Western Northeast Shelterbelt has been largely completed according to plan in most areas.
    Since the Northeast People's Government decided to construct the Northeast Shelterbelt on a large scale, the People's Governments and the masses in western Liaoning, Jilin, and other places have started afforestation according to plan since the beginning of April. A mass afforestation upsurge has been launched in Liaoning Province. By April 20th, 5,664 hectares of shelterbelt had been constructed, exceeding the spring afforestation plan by 392 hectares. Jilin Province has completed its task of constructing 12,009 hectares of forest belt in the spring as scheduled by the end of April. Heilongjiang Province also started this work in mid-April, and by May 7th, more than 9,000 hectares of forest belt had been constructed, accounting for 83 percent of the spring plan to construct 10,800 hectares.
    The masses in the above-mentioned areas have recognized the great significance of constructing shelterbelts, and their enthusiasm for afforestation is unprecedentedly high. In order to ensure the completion of the afforestation task, they have paid special attention to improving cultivation techniques to increase the survival rate of afforestation. In Yushu County, Jilin, the masses participating in afforestation, in order to ensure a survival rate of more than 90 percent, in addition to digging deep pits during planting, also adopted the method of planting trees with water to increase the moisture needed by the seedlings. In the tenth district of Zhangwu County, one of the key afforestation areas in Jilin, the masses participating in afforestation soaked the seedlings in water and watered each seedling with two bowls of water during planting. In order to improve the survival rate of planting, some areas also summarized the past experience in planting trees and afforestation, and invited technicians to study new planting methods.
    Many areas have attached importance to the supply of seedlings in the construction of shelterbelts to ensure the smooth completion of the task. Under the leadership of the government, farmers in Liujiagzi Village and Liuguantun in the tenth district of Zhangwu County, Liaoning Province, collected poplar and willow seedlings in nearby areas and reselected unqualified seedlings, solving the difficulty of lacking 300,000 seedlings. Some counties have also actively opened nurseries and cultivated a large number of seedlings for afforestation this autumn.

    辽西、吉林等地群众造林情绪高涨
    东北西部防护林带春季营造任务大部完成
    东北西部防护林带今春的营造任务，在大部地区已按计划完成。
    自东北人民政府决定大规模营造东北防护林带以后，辽西、吉林等地人民政府和群众，先后自四月初开始按照计划营造。辽西全省掀起了群众性的造林热潮，到四月二十日已营造防护林带五千六百六十四垧，超过今春营造计划三百九十二垧。吉林全省预计在今春营造一万二千零九垧林带的任务已在四月底如期完成。黑龙江省也在四月中旬开始进行这一工作，截至五月七日已营造林带九千多垧，占今春计划营造一万零八百垧的百分之八十三。
    上述地区的群众，认识了营造防护林带的重大意义，造林情绪空前高涨。为了保证营造任务的完成，他们特别注意了改进栽培技术以提高造林的成活率。吉林榆树县参加造林的群众，为了保证百分之九十以上的成活率，除了在植树时深挖坑穴外，还采用了坐水栽树法，以增加苗木所需的水分。吉林造林重点区之一的彰武县第十区参加造林的群众，在植树中做到用水浸苗和一棵苗浇两碗水。有些地区为了提高植树成活率，还总结了过去植树造林的经验，邀请技术人员研究了新的植树方法。
    许多地区在营造防护林带中都重视了供应树苗的工作，以保证任务的顺利完成。辽西省彰武县十区六家子村、柳罐屯的农民，在政府领导下，到附近地区采集杨柳树苗和在不合规格的树苗中进行复选，解决了缺苗三十万株的困难。有的县还积极开辟苗圃，大量育苗，供今秋造林之用。
