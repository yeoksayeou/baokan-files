Visiting Korean Labor Heroes Kim Won-il and Zhu Baoyu

Korean Labor Heroes Kim Won-il and Zhu Baoyu told reporters that they had long wanted to see China, this lovable friend country. This time, they came to Beijing to attend the May 1st International Labor Day celebrations and received a warm welcome from the Chinese people as soon as they crossed the Yalu River. Starting from Andong, the train passed through the boundless fields of Northeast and North China. The vast expanse of green wheat fields made them feel how much rich strength was hidden in this vast land. They did not expect that this country, which had been through many years of war, had been built so prosperously. When reporters visited them, they said, "When we see that China is such a great country, we think that with such strong support for us, we will definitely be able to defeat American imperialism."

They arrived in Beijing at noon on April 29th. During the luncheon, Zhu Baoyu thought of her compatriots who were fighting the enemy in hardship, and she was so moved that she couldn't eat. They both felt that the Chinese comrades were treating them too thoughtfully. They kindly explained to the comrades who were entertaining them that they hoped to take the things used to entertain them to entertain delegations from other countries who had come from further away. They asked to be treated "casually." They considered how to save a little bit of everything to use for the cause of defending peace, as if they were in their own home.

In their conversation, they especially praised the bravery and good discipline of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Therefore, no matter how small the matter they talked about, it always related to the close unity between the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

They talked about the germ warfare waged by American imperialism in Korea and Northeast China with anger and contempt. They unanimously said: No matter how hard American imperialism struggles in the Korean War of aggression, it cannot save its defeat.

They talked about the lives of the Korean people during the war. They said that most of the young people in Korea had gone to the front lines, but the elderly, women, and children were still persevering in production in the rear. Labor competitions were also more widely launched by workers in factories and mines. Kim Won-il is a miner in a lead mine. After the start of the war, he volunteered to join the logistics unit of the Korean People's Army. On May 19th of last year, he returned to work in the mine because industrial production needed him. He said, "I am always thinking that the motherland is at war, and she needs me to use my greatest strength to support her." Therefore, he did not let a minute be wasted in production, and even the time for smoking was calculated. The task stipulated in their mine was that each person should excavate two meters wide and eighty-four millimeters deep every day, but his highest production record reached two meters and nine deep. Inspired by high patriotic enthusiasm, other workers generally exceeded the quota by one time. In January of this year, the Central Committee of the Korean Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of advanced producers from various industries. His advanced experience was widely promoted, and he was awarded the title of Labor Hero.

Zhu Baoyu is a spinning girl worker in a textile factory, with a healthy face and two black and shiny braids hanging on her shoulders, which looks very simple and calm; her heroic deeds further show that she is a brave person. In 1951, the factory where she worked was flooded, and she was awarded the Order of Merit for risking her life to save the machine. In production, she has continuously created new records and won the third-level National Flag Medal.

When we parted, it seemed that there were still many words left unsaid. Our four hands were clenched together, and Kim Won-il said excitedly: "After returning to Korea this time, we must tell the Korean worker brothers about the great achievements of China's construction and the determination of the Chinese people to defend peace in the Far East and the world."

    访朝鲜劳动英雄金元曰、朱宝玉
    朝鲜劳动英雄金元曰和朱宝玉告诉记者：他们早就想看看中国这个可爱的朋友国家了。这一次他们来北京参加“五一”国际劳动节观礼，一过鸭绿江就受到中国人民的热烈欢迎。从安东起，火车穿过一望无际的东北和华北的田野，大片绿油油的麦田，使他们感到这块辽阔的土地上蕴藏着多么丰富的力量。他们没有想到这个曾经过多年战争的国家已经建设得如此繁荣。当记者去访问他们的时候，他们说：“当我们看到中国是这样一个伟大的国家，我们便想到有着这样雄厚的力量在支援我们，我们一定可以打败美帝国主义。”
    他们四月二十九日中午到达北京。在午餐席上，朱宝玉想起了她的同胞们正在艰苦中和敌人搏斗，她激动得吃不下饭去。他俩都感到中国同志对他们招待得太周到了。他们亲切地向招待他们的同志说明，希望把招待他们用的东西，拿去招待更远道来的其他国家的代表团。他们要求对他们“随便点”。他们像在自己家里一样，考虑到怎样可以节省下一点东西来用到保卫和平的事业上去。
    他们在谈话中特别赞扬中国人民志愿军的英勇和良好的纪律，因此，不管谈到一件多末细小的事情，最后，总要涉及到朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的亲密团结。
    他们愤怒地但又很轻蔑地谈到了美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北进行的细菌战。他们一致说：美帝国主义在朝鲜侵略战争中不管怎样挣扎，都不能挽救它的失败。
    他们谈到了朝鲜人民在战争中的生活情形，他们说：朝鲜的年轻人大都上前线了，但老人、妇女和小孩们却仍然在后方坚持生产。工厂矿山的工人们更普遍地展开了劳动竞赛。金元曰就是一个铅矿的矿工。战争开始后他曾志愿参加了朝鲜人民军的后勤部队；去年五月十九日，因为工业生产需要他，才又回到矿山工作。他说：“我时刻都想着祖国在战争中，她需要我拿出最大的力量支援她。”因此，他在生产中一分钟也不让浪费，甚至连抽烟的时间都是计算好的。他们矿山中规定的任务，每人每天要采掘两公尺宽八十四公厘深，他的最高生产纪录却达到两公尺九的深度。在高度的爱国热情鼓舞下，其他的工人也一般都超过定额的一倍。今年一月，朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会召集各业先进生产者开会，他的先进经验曾被普遍推广，他因此获得了劳动英雄勋章。
    朱宝玉是某纺织厂的细纱女工，面容健康，两条黑光光的发辫拖在肩上，显得非常朴实和沉静；她的英雄事迹更说明她是一个勇敢的人。一九五一年她所在的工厂被洪水淹没，她因冒险抢救机器获得功劳勋章，在生产中她因不断创造新纪录，又获得了三级国旗勋章。
    临别的时候，好像还有很多的话没有说完。我们四只手掌捏在一起，金元曰很激动地说：“这次回朝鲜以后，一定要把中国建设的伟大成就，和中国人民保卫远东和世界和平的决心告诉朝鲜工人兄弟。”  （辛茹）（附图片）
