Letter Excerpts

The Democratic German film "Daily Bread" is a good film for promoting ideological transformation.

After watching the film "Daily Bread," I deeply realized that the working class has a strong fighting will, great foresight, and perseverance. Whenever Ers argued with his father, Karl Weibers, he sharply criticized his father's so-called "money is everything" thinking, and reminded him that the most precious thing in the world is labor, our hands, and that it is the working people of the world who create the world, not money and parasites like Heli. These words demonstrate the true nature of the working class.

Although New China has been established for almost three years, backward people like Karl Weibers still exist. I think the film "Daily Bread" has a great enlightening and promoting effect on the ideological transformation of such people. Liu Renjun

Hoping for more translations and screenings of excellent films from New Democratic countries.

After watching the Democratic German film "Daily Bread," I felt that it sharply pointed out the path that people should take. In dealing with family problems, the film tells us that we must also follow the truth and adhere to the truth in order to transform the family and create happiness. We saw in the film the life of the German people who had just been liberated after the war, who could barely get enough to eat with black bread, and we sympathized with the disasters they suffered in the war and hated the crimes of the warmongers. We also saw in this film how the working class used selfless labor to build people's industries on the ruins. This spirit deeply moved me and made me have a further understanding of the brotherly country - Democratic Germany. We hope that relevant departments will translate and screen more excellent films from various New Democratic countries in the future, which will be beneficial to deepening the friendship between the people of brotherly countries.

A few days ago, our school screened the Hungarian film "Mattie the Gooseherd Boy," which was unanimously praised by the students. Although I was limited by language, I got a deep impression.

This film is adapted from a famous Hungarian long poem. It clearly tells us how the Hungarian peasants could not bear the oppression of the landlords and bureaucrats, and bravely rose up to fight. They, like the Chinese people, have the character of diligence, bravery and tenacious struggle. At the same time, in this film, we can see the corrupt and depraved life of the bureaucratic landlords. Such films have a great educational effect on us. I suggest that comrades who work on film translation translate more excellent films from New Democratic countries in order to enhance our mutual understanding and learn from each other's experiences.

The Soviet film "Spring in the Wilderness" corrected my wrong view of the mountainous areas of Northwest Shanxi.

After reading the article "The Light of Communism Shines into Remote Mountain Villages" published in the People's Daily on May 3, which introduced the Soviet film "Spring in the Wilderness," I was very excited. This increased my infinite confidence in the construction of New China. It made me feel that wherever the Communist Party goes, it will bring infinite happiness to that place. Sagan in the Soviet Union, originally a place almost isolated from the world, is now, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, using the natural conditions there to transform nature and using vivid and realistic education to transform the conservative and backward thinking of the peasants, making a backward area a leap to a prosperous and advanced collective farm. What a great miracle!

I was born in the mountainous area of ​​Northwest Shanxi. I used to think that this area has rugged roads, inconvenient transportation, barren land, and poor products, and there is no future for construction; I thought that tractors could not be used here, and even if the mountainous areas were built into terraced fields, a few more grains could not be produced, let alone develop industry. Therefore, sometimes I even feel that this area cannot enter socialist society. After reading the article "The Light of Communism Shines into Remote Mountain Villages," I realized that my thinking was wrong. Every most remote and backward place in New China will also take the bright road and gain a happy life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

I love the bottle dance performed by the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe.

The bottle dance performed by the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe is really wonderful. It can be said to be the most beautiful kind of folk dance.

At the beginning of the bottle dance, the Hungarian girls dressed in colorful clothes, each with a bottle full of red wine on their heads, singing sweet Hungarian songs, dancing as if drunk and crazy, but the bottles on their heads are always so stable, and their movements are so beautiful and skillful. They are not professional dancers, but their artistic accomplishment is very high. As far as I know, the Beijing Film Studio has filmed the programs performed by the Hungarian National People's Art Troupe in China into a movie, which is gratifying.

"Geographical Knowledge" published "The Gaoshan People of Taiwan" which is an absurd article.

"Geographical Knowledge," Volume 3, Issue 1, edited by the Editorial Committee of Geographical Knowledge of the Geographical Society of China, published an article "The Gaoshan People of Taiwan" written by Huang Jinli and excerpted and translated by Huang Zongzhen (originally published in the Japanese "Nature Magazine"). I think this is a very wrong article. In this article, the author actually describes the Gaoshan people, who are scantily clad and unable to make ends meet under the bloody rule of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, as people wearing "unique costumes," eating "rice and vegetables," and "can work freely according to their own wishes without any restrictions," "singing and working, the scene is quite leisurely." The author distorts the objective reality and attempts to quibble for the crimes of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in exploiting the Gaoshan people. I hope the editors of this magazine will face this mistake and conduct a profound review.

The People's Bank should provide convenience for depositors to deposit and withdraw money.

Through this "Three-Anti" Movement, the political awareness of ordinary people has been greatly improved. Many people have reduced unnecessary personal expenses and deposited money in the National Bank to accumulate construction funds for the country.

Most of the people who deposit small amounts of money in the bank are working people, but the working hours of the savings department of the People's Bank conflict with the working hours of these depositors. Many people have to ask for leave every time they deposit or withdraw small amounts of money, which affects their work, and these times accumulate to be considerable.

I hope that the savings department of the People's Bank can take care of the convenience of depositors and change the working hours - preferably to 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm every day, and work all day on Sundays. And think of other ways to facilitate depositors to deposit or withdraw money.

The fire department should check foam fire extinguishers in time.

Our hospital purchased 18 foam fire extinguishers produced by the Beijing Fire Equipment Factory in July last year, and the warranty period for these fire extinguishers is one year. Before the "May Day" this year, our hospital asked the factory to send someone to inspect them. A comrade Wang came, and after inspecting them, he said: "They have not lost their effectiveness." After an on-the-spot test, although the fire extinguisher sprayed foam, it could not extinguish the fire. All agencies buy fire equipment to prevent fire. If the fire extinguisher cannot extinguish the fire, wouldn't it delay the big event and cause serious damage to state property in the event of negligence? Therefore, I suggest that the Beijing Fire Equipment Factory and the fire department should conduct timely inspections.

Suggestions on the telecommunications bureau's collection of telephone charges.

I am a bill collector at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau. In my past work, I found that users falsely reported the type of telephone and paid the monthly telephone rent late, most of whom were illegal capitalists. This situation has now been basically resolved. In order to prevent the state's assets from being lost again, I suggest that the telecommunications bureau implement a method of collecting "late fees" from telephone users who pay late. In this way, on the one hand, it can compensate for the country's losses, and on the other hand, it can also punish illegal users. I hope that users will no longer falsely report the type of telephone in the future, and will no longer pay the monthly telephone rent late. For past wrong behaviors, users should correct them in future practical actions.

    来信摘要
    民主德国影片“每日的粮食”是一部推进思想改造的好影片
    当我看完了电影“每日的粮食”以后，深切地体会到工人阶级有坚强的斗争意志，具有伟大的远见和毅力。每当艾尔斯和他父亲卡尔·魏伯斯争吵的时候，他就尖锐地指斥他父亲的所谓“金钱万能”的思想，并提醒他世上最珍贵的是劳动，是我们的双手，创造世界的是全世界的劳动人民，不是金钱和那些像海利一样的寄生虫。这些话表现了工人阶级的本色。
    新中国虽然已经成立快到三年了，但像卡尔·魏伯斯那样落后的人物还存在着。我认为电影“每日的粮食”，对于这类人物的思想改造是有很大启发和推进作用的。　刘仁俊
    希望多多译制和放映新民主主义国家的优秀影片
    我看了民主德国影片“每日的粮食”后，觉得它非常尖锐地给人们指出了应走的道路。在处理家庭问题上，影片告诉我们也要服膺真理，坚持真理，才能够改造家庭，创造幸福。我们看到影片中描写战后刚得到解放的德国人民那吃黑面包还难得一饱的生活，我们同情他们在战争中所受的灾难，痛恨战争贩子的罪恶。我们在这部影片里也看到了工人阶级以忘我的劳动，在废墟上建立起了人民的工业，这种精神深深感动了我，使我对兄弟国家——民主德国，有了进一步的了解。我们希望有关部门今后多多译制、放映各新民主主义国家的优秀影片，这对于加深兄弟国家人民的友谊是有益处的。

    前几天我们学校里放映了匈牙利影片“牧鹅童马季”，这部影片受到同学们一致的赞扬。我虽然受到了语言的限制，但是得到了一个深刻的印象。
    这部影片是根据匈牙利一篇有名的长诗改编的。它明白地告诉我们：匈牙利的农民怎样不堪受地主官僚的压迫，英勇地起来斗争，他们和中国人民一样有着勤劳、勇敢和顽强的斗争性格。同时，在这部影片里，我们可以看到官僚地主的腐化堕落的生活。这样的影片对于我们的教育作用是大的。我建议作电影翻译工作的同志，多翻译一些新民主主义国家的优秀影片，以增进我们的互相了解，互相吸取经验。

    苏联影片“山野的春天”，纠正了我对晋西北山地错误的看法
    我读了人民日报五月三日登载的评介苏联影片“山野的春天”的文章：“共产主义的光芒照进了僻远的山村”后，十分兴奋。这增加了我对新中国建设的无限信心。它使我感到：共产党走到那里，就会给那里带来无限的幸福。苏联的萨根，原是一个几乎与世隔绝的地方，今天在苏联共产党的领导下，利用了那里的自然条件，改造了自然，用生动的现实的教育，改造了农民保守、落后的思想，使一个落后的地区，一跃而变为富饶的先进农庄。这是多么伟大的奇迹啊！
    我生在晋西北的山地，以前一向认为这个地区道路崎岖、交通不便、土地贫瘦、物产不丰，将来也没有建设的前途；认为在这里不能使用拖拉机，就是把山地修成梯田，也多打不了几颗粮食，更谈不到发展工业。所以，有时我竟觉得这个地区无法进到社会主义社会。我读了“共产主义的光芒照进了僻远的山村”一文后，才感到我的那种想法是不对的，新中国每个最偏僻、最落后的地方，也将要在中国共产党、毛主席领导下，走向光明的道路，获得幸福的生活。　侯耀先
    我爱匈牙利国家人民文工团表演的瓶舞
    匈牙利国家人民文工团演出的瓶舞，真是好极了。这真可说是民间舞中最优美的一种舞蹈。
    瓶舞开始，穿着彩色衣服的匈牙利姑娘，每个人头上都顶着一个装满红色的酒的酒瓶，唱着悦耳的匈牙利歌，跳得如醉如狂，但头顶上的酒瓶却永远是那么安稳，她们的动作是那么优美、娴熟。她们并不是职业的舞蹈家，她们的艺术修养却是很高的。据我了解，北京电影制片厂已把匈牙利国家人民文工团在中国表演的节目摄成电影，这是可喜的。

    “地理知识”登载的“台湾的高山族”是一篇荒谬的文章
    中国地理学会地理知识编委会编的“地理知识”三卷一期，登载了黄金丽作、黄宗甄节译的“台湾的高山族”一文（原载日文“自然杂志”）。我认为这是一篇十分错误的文章。在这篇文章里，作者竟把在美帝国主义和国民党反动派血腥统治下的衣不蔽体、食不果腹的高山族，描写为穿着“别致的服装”，吃着“稻米及蔬菜”，“可以自由自在的依照自己的愿望去工作，不受什么拘束”，“一面唱歌，一面劳动，光景是相当优游的”人民。作者歪曲了客观的现实，妄图为美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮压榨高山族人民的罪行进行诡辩。希望这个刊物的编辑者正视这个错误，并进行深刻的检讨。

    人民银行应给储蓄户存款和提款以方便
    经过这次“三反”运动，一般人的政治认识都大大提高了。很多人都减少了不必要的个人开支，把钱存到国家银行去，替国家积累建设的资金。
    在银行存小额存款的大多是劳动人民，但人民银行储蓄部门的工作时间是和这些储户的工作时间相冲突的。有许多人每因为存储或提取小额款，必须请假，这样就影响了工作，这些时间积累起来，是很可观的。
    我希望人民银行储蓄工作部门能照顾到储户的方便，把工作时间改一下——最好是改在每天下午六时到八时，星期日则全天工作。并想别的办法，便利储户存款或提款。　禾子
    消防负责部门应及时检查泡沫灭火机
    我们医院在去年七月购买了十八个北京消防器材厂出品的泡沫灭火机，这些灭火机的保用期是一年。今年“五一”节前，我们医院请这个厂派人来检查。来了一位王同志，他检查后说：“没有失去效力。”经过当场试验，灭火机虽然喷出了泡沫，但是不能灭火。各机关是为了防止火灾，才买消防器材的。如果灭火机竟不能起灭火的作用，一旦到了失慎的时候，岂不是要延误大事，使国家财产遭受严重损失吗？因此，我建议北京消防器材厂及消防负责部门，应及时进行检查。

    关于电信局收电话费的建议
    我是北京市电信局的收费员。我在过去的工作中发现用户冒报电话种类和过期缴纳电话月租费的情况相当严重，其中大部分是违法资本家。这一情况现在已经基本上得到解决了。为了使国家资财不再遭受损失，我建议电信局对过期缴费的电话用户，施行征缴“滞纳金”的办法。这样，一方面能补偿国家的损失，一方面也可对违章用户有所惩戒。希望用户今后不再冒报电话种类，也不再过期缴纳电话月租费。对于过去的错误行为，用户应当在今后实际行动中改正。
