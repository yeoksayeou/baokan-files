The North China Team of Returned Volunteer Combat Heroes, the Returned Volunteer Delegation, and the North China Sub-Delegation of the Korean People's Delegation to China, totaling forty people, successively went to various provinces, cities, Inner Mongolia, industrial and mining areas, and key counties in North China in March and April to deliver reports. As of March 16, a total of 904 reports had been made, with over 4,490,000 direct listeners. Newspapers and radio stations in various provinces vigorously cooperated with the activities of the representatives, carrying out propaganda and expanding the influence of the representatives' activities. In addition to giving reports, the representatives also participated in various symposiums, conducted visits, celebrated achievements, and organized representative meetings (absorbing propagandists to participate), which yielded great results.

The representatives' reports focused on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the cities, playing a significant role in encouraging them. During the activities of the returned volunteer representatives in Dingxian Special District, Hebei Province, the district actively organized the study and discussion of the representatives' reports as an important teaching material for training "tiger-fighting teams." The workers of the Fengfeng Coal Mine proposed to welcome the returned volunteer representatives and the Korean People's Delegation to China with practical actions, and the daily coal production of the Suowen class increased from 500 tons to 720 tons. After listening to the report, family members of the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine workers automatically organized "tiger-fighting teams" to carry out activities among family members to help their husbands clarify problems. After listening to the report, employees of a steel plant in Taiyuan worked all night and caught sixteen "tigers." The representatives' reports inspired the cadres' confidence and determination to fight "tigers," strengthened the counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, and also inspired corrupt elements to boldly confess their problems. Wang Zhan'en, a corrupt element in the Xinhua Bookstore of Xinxiang Special District, Pingyuan Province, was moved after listening to the report and said, "The volunteers and the Korean People's Army are bravely sacrificing and struggling hard at the front. If I have embezzled and don't completely confess, I really can't live with myself!" He had only confessed to 10 million yuan of embezzlement in the past, but after listening to the report, he confessed to 130 million yuan of embezzlement. Liu Yangcai, director of the Anguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province, was a major embezzler. He was moved by the noble spirit of the volunteers who cherished national materials as they cherished their own lives, and quickly confessed to his criminal acts of embezzling and accepting bribes, causing the country to lose more than 500 million yuan in property. Chen Jingquan, a purchasing agent of the Xinxiang City Trust Company, originally refused to confess, fearing detention and the return of ill-gotten gains. After listening to the report, he made up his mind and confessed to 300 million yuan of embezzlement.

The representatives' reports also vigorously promoted drought resistance and famine preparedness in rural areas. After listening to the report, Zhou Lujie, a labor model in Huolu County, Hebei Province, immediately proposed to call on all labor models in the county to take the lead in ensuring drought prevention work, striving to dig more wells and carry water to plant cotton, and ensuring a 15% increase in grain production this year to support the Korean people's just war. After listening to the report, the masses in Chengguan Village, Boye County, held a meeting of eighteen young members of the Communist Youth League and more than thirty young people, drawing up a plan to ensure that they would do a good job in tilling land for others, digging seven new wells, repairing five old wells, buying ten waterwheels, further consolidating production mutual aid teams, and mobilizing the masses to increase production to support the volunteers.

The representatives reported the brutal and shameless atrocities of American imperialism and the battle deeds of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, which further strengthened the masses' hatred and belief in victory. Liu Xiuqin, a student at Shanxi University, originally had serious pro-American ideas, and felt it was an honor to write notes in English. After listening to the report, she felt that her slavish thinking was too shameful and was determined to transform herself. After listening to the report, nineteen shop assistants in Guisui City immediately called the municipal party committee, requesting to work on the front lines in Korea.

Many vivid facts show that the broad masses love the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and even more love the people's heroes and combat heroes. They have a great appeal. In addition, the leaders at all levels attach great importance to this, and responsible comrades personally attend meetings, organize venues, and promptly collect feedback after the reports. By combining the current central work and the specific situation of the unit for serious discussion, such reports often become a huge driving force for promoting work and a key to doing a good job.

    志愿军归国代表的活动推动了华北区爱国增产运动
    志愿军战斗英雄归国代表华北小组、志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团华北分团共四十人，三、四月份先后赴华北各省、市、内蒙和工矿区及重点县进行传达报告。截至三月十六日，共作报告九百零四次，直接听众四百四十九万余人。各省报纸、广播电台都有力地配合代表们的活动，进行宣传，扩大了代表们活动的影响。代表们除作报告外，并参加了各种座谈会、进行参观、访问、庆功、组织有代表性的会议（吸收宣传员参加），收效很大。
    代表们的报告，在城市以配合“三反”“五反”运动为主，起了很大的鼓动作用。河北省定县专区当志愿军归国代表们在该专区活动期间，积极组织对代表们的报告的学习讨论，作为训练“打虎队”的重要教材。峰峰煤矿的工人们提出用实际行动欢迎志愿军归国代表和朝鲜人民访华代表，索文班每天产煤量由五百吨提高到七百二十吨。太原西山煤矿家属听报告后，自动组织“打虎队”，在家属中进行活动，帮助丈夫搞清问题。太原某钢铁厂职工听了报告，连夜工作，捉住十六只“老虎”。代表的报告鼓舞了干部打“虎”的信心和决心，加强了对资产阶级猖狂进攻的反击，同时也启发了贪污分子大胆地交代问题。平原省新乡专区新华书店贪污分子王占恩，听报告后感动地说：“志愿军和朝鲜人民军在前线英勇牺牲，艰苦奋斗，我贪污了还不彻底交代，心里真是过不去！”他过去仅只交代一千万元的贪污事实，听报告后坦白了一亿三千万元的贪污事实。河北省安国县供销合作社主任刘养才是一个大贪污分子，为志愿军爱护国家物资像爱护自己生命一样的高尚精神所感动，很快地坦白了因自己贪污受贿使国家财产损失五亿多元的罪恶行为。新乡市信托公司采购员陈静泉原来拒不坦白，害怕扣押、倒赃，听报告后下了决心，坦白出三亿元的贪污罪行。
    代表们的报告，也有力地推动了农村中的抗旱备荒工作。河北省获鹿县劳动模范周路杰听过报告后，当场提出要号召全县劳动模范一齐带头，保证做好防旱工作，争取多打井、担水种棉，保证今年粮食增产百分之十五，以支援朝鲜人民的正义战争。博野县城关村群众听了报告后，有十八个青年团员和三十多个青年开会订出计划，要保证做好代耕工作；打七眼新井、修理五眼旧井，买十辆水车，进一步巩固生产互助组，带动群众增加生产，支援志愿军。
    代表们报告了美帝国主义残暴无耻的兽行，以及中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的战斗事迹，更增强了群众的仇恨心理和必胜信念。山西大学学生刘秀琴原来崇美思想很严重，觉得写笔记用英文是件光荣的事，听了报告后感觉自己奴化思想太可耻，下决心要改造自己。归绥市店员听完报告后，马上有十九个人给市委打电话，要求到朝鲜前线工作。
    许多生动的事实说明：广大群众热爱志愿军和朝鲜人民军，更热爱人民功臣和战斗英雄，他们有很大的号召力。加以各级领导上很重视，负责同志亲自到会，组织会场，报告后及时搜集反映，结合当前中心工作和本单位具体情况认真讨论，这种报告往往成为推动工作的巨大动力和搞好工作的关键。
