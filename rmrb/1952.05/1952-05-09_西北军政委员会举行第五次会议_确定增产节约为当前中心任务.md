    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th: The Northwest Military and Political Committee held its fifth meeting from April 29th to May 2nd. The meeting reviewed and summarized the work of the Northwest Military and Political Committee in the five months since the fourth meeting and determined that the central task of all work currently is to carry out a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

    Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Summary of Five Months' Work and Current Tasks." Xi Zhongxun proposed that the central task in the Northwest region is to carry out a large-scale, enthusiastic, and sustained campaign to increase production and practice economy. He said: In terms of agricultural production, we must complete the glorious task of increasing production by 1.32 billion catties of grain and 710,000 dan of cotton, and strive for a bumper harvest this year. In terms of public enterprises, we will strive to complete and exceed the glorious task of increasing production and practicing economy by 1500 billion yuan this year, and strengthen the leadership of private industrial and commercial enterprises. In pastoral areas, resolutely protecting and vigorously developing animal husbandry should be the central task. In his report, Xi Zhongxun focused on summarizing the work experience in ethnic minority areas, and pointed out: In these areas, it is necessary to unite all the people of all ethnic groups and move forward steadily. Every major movement must be based on the demands of the local people of all ethnic groups, obtain the approval of all parties, have the correct leadership of the Communist Party, have local ethnic minority cadres participate in the work, and take working methods that are completely suitable for the local environment to do it. It can only be done well, not badly. All ethnic minority settlements must combine the development of various industries, production and other work and strive to promote regional autonomy.

    During the discussion at the meeting, the members and representatives of various ethnic groups spoke enthusiastically. They unanimously celebrated the great victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Committee member Xirao Gyatso (Tibetan) said: "The 'Three-Anti' and 'Five-Anti' movements have eliminated the 'three evils' and 'five poisons'. This is a great social reform movement that has never occurred in our country for thousands of years. It can only be achieved under the wise and outstanding leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." Representatives of ethnic minorities expressed their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the People's Government for their leadership and care for ethnic minorities, and said that they will learn more humbly from Han cadres and Communist Party members in the future, continuously improve their political awareness, and lead the people of all ethnic minorities to develop political, economic, cultural and educational undertakings. They put forward many specific suggestions for improving transportation, trade, finance, medical care and other work in ethnic minority areas.

    The meeting adopted Xi Zhongxun's report on "Summary of Five Months' Work and Current Tasks" and approved reports on the financial and economic work situation and ideological remolding issues.
