Employees of the weaving workshops of the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 and No. 5 Cotton Textile Factories have actively improved their oiling methods and the labor organization of the oilers. Preliminary statistics indicate that this will result in an annual increase in production and savings of 200 million yuan.

The improved Toyota loom oiling method developed by employees of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory's weaving workshop is now being prepared for promotion throughout the factory. The characteristics of the new oiling method are that oilers have a reasonable division of labor and responsibility, with three people per shift, each responsible for the oiling and oil hole cleaning of eighty looms. After each shift's work is completed, they spend thirty minutes doing mutual inspection work, writing down any shortcomings found in a record book, and then the person being inspected adds oil again according to the machine number and shortcomings. Each oiling shift selects a worker with better performance to be responsible for the shift handover; for the shortcomings found during inspection, in addition to the shift adding oil again, they are also written in the record book to notify the next shift workers to pay attention. This can exchange experience, strengthen unity, and reduce machine wear and tear. After the implementation of the new oiling method, oil and labor can be saved. In the past, the daily use of machine oil was 16.12 kilograms; after the implementation of the new method, the daily use is 14.4 kilograms. It is estimated that the factory can save more than 68 million yuan annually. At the same time, two fewer oilers are needed than before. Overtime oiling on Sundays is also saved. More importantly, after the implementation of the new oiling method, machine damage has been greatly reduced. In the past, the average number of damaged machine parts per month was five, now it is only one per month.

The original labor organization of the oilers in the No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory's weaving workshop was divided into early, late, and regular day shifts, with three people per shift. Now the regular day shift has been cancelled, and the early and late shifts have been increased from three to four people per shift, implementing a two-person mutual assistance work method by area. After changing the labor organization, the number of oilers was reduced from nine to eight. Because of the mutual assistance during work, not only is the physical labor of the workers reduced, but also the downtime is shortened. According to the measurement results: looms with large oil holes save enough time each day to weave 17.4 more yards of cloth, and looms with small oil holes can weave 8.9 more yards of cloth.

The North China Textile Administration is preparing to promote the above-mentioned new oiling methods and labor organization in its affiliated cotton textile factories. (Xiao Mai)

    国营天津第二、第五棉纺织厂织布车间职工
    改进加油工作法和加油工人的劳动组织
    减少机件磨损，节省用油和人力，全年可增产节约两亿元
    国营天津第二、第五两棉纺织厂织布车间职工，积极地改进了加油工作法及加油工人的劳动组织。据初步统计，全年可增产节约两亿元。
    棉纺二厂织布间职工改进的丰田布机加油工作法，现已准备在全厂推广。新加油工作法的特点是加油工人合理分工负责，每班三人，每人负责八十台布机的注油、油眼清洁等工作。在每班工作做完后，用三十分钟的时间做互助检查工作，把检查出来的缺点写在记录本上，再由被检查人按着机号缺点再加一次油。每个加油班找出一个工作较好的工人负责交班工作；对于检查出来的缺点，除本班另行加油外，并写在记录本上通知接班工人加以注意。这样可以交流经验，加强团结，并能减少机件磨损等现象。新加油工作法实行后，可以节省用油和人工。过去每天用机器油十六点一二公斤；实行新工作法后每天用十四点四公斤。估计全厂全年可节约六千八百多万元。同时，较前减少二个加油工。星期天加班加油也节省了。更重要的是新加油工作法实行后，机件损坏大为减少。以前每月损坏机件平均为五件，现在每月只一件。
    棉纺五厂织布间原有的加油工人劳动组织，分早、晚及常日三班，每班三人。现在把常日班取消，早班及晚班每班由三人增至四人，实行分区二人互助工作法。改变了劳动组织以后，加油工由九人减为八人。由于工作时实行互助，不但减轻了工人的体力劳动，同时缩短了停车时间。据测定结果：大油眼的布机每天节省的时间可多织十七点四码布，小油眼布机可多织八点九码布。
    以上新的加油工作法和劳动组织，华北纺织管理局准备在所属各棉纺织厂推广。（萧迈）
