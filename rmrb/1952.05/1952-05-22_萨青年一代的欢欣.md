Lhasa Dispatch

    For the first time in history, the Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Mongolian youths of Lhasa are celebrating their own festival, the "May Fourth" Youth Day. The sons and daughters of Tibet, who have returned to the big family of the motherland, are embarking on their bright path, filled with love for the motherland and a desire for progress.
    From May 2nd to 4th, every noon, young workers wearing Mao Zedong badge, young intellectuals of both sexes dressed in beautiful clothes, young lamas, and young officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa gathered from various streets and alleys at the newly built Lhasa Primary School. For days, they held literary and art get-togethers and speeches, commemorating the "May Fourth" Movement and celebrating the establishment of the Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League in the Tibet Region. The campus was decorated with pictorials published in Tibetan and Chinese and photos of the happy lives of young people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. Young people of all ethnic groups talked together, read newspapers and books, and danced and sang happily. At the various meetings, young people of all ethnic groups gave speeches in their own languages. Many young people said excitedly, "This is the first time in my life that I am so happy. This new life was given to us by Chairman Mao." They expressed: "We must learn the patriotic spirit of the advanced youth of fraternal ethnic groups and, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, completely drive the imperialist aggressor forces out of Tibet. We, the younger generation, bear the glorious mission of building a new Tibet." At the commemoration meeting, Tibetan young woman Yangjie Zhengge led everyone in singing the Youth Ode: "Unite, young people of all ethnic groups, drive out the imperialist forces, and turn Tibet into a paradise under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao." When cheering "Long live Chairman Mao," the young people threw their hats into the air. Mao Zedong's portrait was published on the wall newspapers. The Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini both wrote inscriptions for the wall newspapers run by the young people, calling on the young people to unite and implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Every night after the evening party, the young people happily sang songs such as "Imperialists Get Out of Tibet" and "New China Youth March" as they walked home.
    During these days, not only the young people in Lhasa were happy and excited, but many old and middle-aged people also participated in many activities of the young people. Tibetan scholar and poet Awa Chazhu, who is 73 years old, and writer Jiangjin Gongsu both participated in the compilation of wall newspapers and various gatherings. The old poet Awa Chazhu recited his poems praising Stalin and Mao Zedong at the meeting. He also taught the young people: "You must recognize who has harmed us and who has given us happiness! Only then can you more faithfully follow Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." In order to meet the urgent demands of Lhasa youth to study politics and new knowledge, the translation and compilation committee composed of experts entering Tibet and Lhasa scholars is stepping up the translation of textbooks for primary and junior high schools and political study materials for the youth. Awa Chazhu has compiled a brief history of the relations between the Han and Tibetan nationalities in Tibetan. Literary and art workers entering Tibet have collected many excellent Tibetan folk songs and dances, preparing to help them improve; and will introduce mainland dances and music to the Tibetan people. The future life of Tibetan youth will be even better! (Xinhua News Agency)

    萨青年一代的欢欣
    拉萨的藏、汉、回、蒙各族青年们有史以来第一次纪念自己的节日“五四”青年节。回到了祖国大家庭的西藏儿女们满怀着热爱祖国和要求进步的热情，开始走向他们光明的路程。
    从五月二日到四日，每天中午的时候，胸上挂着毛主席像纪念章的青年工人，穿戴着漂亮服装的男女知识青年，青年喇嘛和驻拉萨解放军的青年指战员们，从各街巷汇集到新建的拉萨小学校园里，连日，他们举行了文艺联欢会、演讲会，纪念“五四”和庆祝新民主主义青年团西藏地区工作委员会成立的大会。校园里布置着用藏文、汉文出版的画报和祖国各民族青年们的幸福生活的照片。各族青年们在一起交谈，阅读书报，欢乐地跳舞歌唱。在各次会议上，各民族青年都用本民族的语言演讲。许多青年激动地说：“我有生以来第一次这样高兴，这新的生活是毛主席给我们的。”他们表示：“我们要学习兄弟民族先进青年的爱国主义精神，在中央人民政府领导下彻底把帝国主义侵略势力赶出西藏去。我们这一代青年担负着建设新西藏的光荣使命。”在纪念会上，藏族女青年杨杰正噶领导大家高唱青年颂歌：“团结起来，各民族的青年，驱逐帝国主义势力，在毛主席的光辉照耀下把西藏变成乐园。”在欢呼毛主席万岁时，青年们都把帽子抛向空中。墙报上都刊了毛主席的画像。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼都为青年们办的墙报亲笔题字，号召青年们团结起来实现关于和平解放西藏办法的协议。每天晚会后青年们都快乐地高唱着“帝国主义滚出西藏去”和“新中国青年进行曲”等歌子走回家里。
    这几天不仅拉萨的青年们欢欣振奋，许多老年和壮年人也参加了青年们的许多活动。年已七十三岁的藏族学者、诗人阿瓦察主和文学家降金贡素都参加了墙报的编写工作和各次集会。老诗人阿瓦察主在会上朗诵了他赞美斯大林和毛泽东的诗。他并教导青年们：“你们必需认清谁侵害了我们，谁给我们幸福！这样，你们才能更忠实地跟着毛主席共产党走。”为了满足拉萨青年们学习政治，学习新知识的迫切要求，入藏的专家和拉萨学者所组成的编译委员会，正加紧为青年们翻译小学、初中的课本和政治学习材料。阿瓦察主已用藏文编好了汉、藏民族关系简史。入藏的文艺工作者已搜集了许多优秀的藏族民间歌舞，准备帮助他们提高；并将内地的舞蹈和音乐介绍给西藏人民。西藏青年们今后的生活将会更加美好！  （新华社）
