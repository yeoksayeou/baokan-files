Overcoming the Lag in Dramatic Creation
*Pravda* Editorial

I.

Soviet dramatic creation is an integral part of our country's advanced socialist culture. The development of Soviet stage art depends entirely on the state of dramatic creation. The progress and innovative significance of Soviet dramatic creation lie in its reflection of our socialist reality in authentic artistic images, affirming the most advanced contemporary thought, and publicizing the policies of the Soviet state.

Soviet dramatic creation, for the first time in history, has brought new figures to the stage – people of free labor who have established a new life and become its true masters.

Inheriting and creatively developing the excellent traditions of Russian classical dramatic creation, and advancing along the path of socialist realism, Soviet writers have produced many outstanding works, creating examples of Soviet classical dramatic creation. Gorky's dramatic creation played an outstanding role in the development of our stage art. In the Soviet era, Gorky wrote several classic plays: "Yegor Bulychov and Others" and "Dostigayev and Others." Gorky's works paved the way for us to establish socialist realism in dramatic creation.

Trenev's "Lyubov Yarovaya," Ivanov's "Armored Train," Lavrenyov's "The Break," Biri Belotserkovsky's "Storm at Sea" and other plays have been widely praised and have helped shape the repertoire of Soviet theaters. In the post-war period, similar works have emerged, such as Romashov's "Great Force," Simonov's "The Russian Question," Lavrenyov's "The Voice of America" and "Blessing the Seafarers," Korniychuk's "Makar Dubrava," Vishnevsky's "Unforgettable 1919," Sofronov's "Moscow Character," Surov's "Green Street," Krapiva's "The Lark Sings," Yakobson's "Two Camps," and other plays.

Our increasingly vibrant life constantly poses new and higher tasks for art. The cultural level of the Soviet people is improving day by day, and therefore their demands on art are constantly increasing.

Soviet writers should raise the ideological and artistic level of our dramatic creation even higher, and more completely reflect the multifaceted lives of their contemporaries. However, our playwrights have performed poorly in executing the tasks before them.

In the current theatrical festival repertoire of the capital's theaters, audiences cannot find vivid and significant plays on modern Soviet themes. In the new plays performed in the theaters, the life of Soviet people today has not received the artistic embodiment it deserves. The state of dramatic creation currently does not meet the demands of the people and the Party.

It cannot be said that we do not have plays on great and important modern themes. No, there are quite a few such plays. But among the large number of plays created by our playwrights, only a small number can be staged. The obvious disparity between the quantity and quality of existing plays indicates that the working direction of many playwrights is incorrect.

The repertoire of most theaters is rarely supplemented with good plays. The designated task of having each drama theater stage at least two to three high-quality plays with modern themes has not yet been completed. It is therefore not surprising that this situation often nullifies the efforts of many highly talented stage artists.

The lag in dramatic creation behind the people's ever-increasing demands can be seen from the repertoire of some of the largest theaters in the country, such as the Moscow Art Theater, the Maly Theater, the Leningrad Pushkin Theater, and other theaters, all of which are unsatisfactory. The repertoire of some theaters in several union republics is equally unsatisfactory. The lag in dramatic creation seriously affects the work of theaters everywhere.

It cannot but attract the attention of the Soviet people that when the Stalin Prizes for 1951 were awarded, no Soviet dramatic creation received a first or second prize, and only two plays received a third prize.

Soviet literature possesses a large number of talented and skilled playwrights. Favorable conditions have been created in our country for artistic creation. The meaningful and spiritually rich life of the Soviet people will give artists unlimited material to create outstanding works of socialist realism. Soviet writers have every possibility to overcome the temporary lag in dramatic creation.

In investigating the reasons for the lag in dramatic creation, it must be pointed out that both the "Council of the Soviet Writers' Union" and the "Committee on Arts Affairs" have weaknesses in guiding the arrangement of theater repertoires. But the main and decisive reason is that some playwrights and critics have an incorrect understanding of certain issues in the theory and practice of socialist realism, primarily the issue of conflict as the basis of dramatic works.

II.

The most important task of playwrights and stage artists is to reflect the spiritual richness of the Soviet people, to reflect the outstanding characteristics of their character displayed in creative labor and in the struggle to build a communist society; to praise the greatness and power of our motherland, to praise the growing strength of freedom, peace and democracy throughout the world and its struggle against the destructive forces of reaction, war and darkness.

An artist who truly understands life and can make thoughtful observations of everything around him cannot fail to see that on the road of communist construction, one often encounters obstacles, difficulties, conflicts, and serious, real contradictions, and that overcoming these things requires great effort and a high degree of awareness of one's patriotic duty. The struggle between the new and the old often causes various conflicts in life. Without these conflicts there is no life, and therefore no art.

The main reason for the poverty of dramatic creation, and the weakness of many plays, is that playwrights have not used those profound, life-based conflicts as the basis of their works, but have instead let them go. If judged by this type of play, it would seem that everything is beautiful and ideal, and there are no more conflicts. Some playwrights believe that they are almost not allowed to criticize the bad and negative things in our life. And other critics demand that only ideal and perfect types be represented in works of art, and if writers and playwrights represent existing negative things in life, they will be heavily criticized.

It is wrong to look at problems in this way. To do so is to show cowardice, to commit a crime against the truth.

Not everything is ideal and perfect, and some negative types still exist. There are still many evils in our life, and many hypocritical people. We must not be afraid to expose shortcomings and difficulties. Problems must be treated. We need people like Gogol and Shchedrin. Where there is no movement, no development, there are no problems. But we are developing and moving forward, which means that we still have both difficulties and shortcomings.

Dramatic creation should point out the conflicts in life; without this, there is no dramatic creation.

It should be pointed out that the criticism of literature and drama is incompetent. In recent years, a vulgar "theory" of eliminating conflict has prevailed, which has had a harmful impact on the creative work of playwrights. According to the founders of this so-called "theory," "lack of conflict" should be the most authentic characteristic of Soviet plays.

Things have reached the point where *Soviet Art News* contemptuously and sarcastically calls the issue of dramatic conflict a "sensational issue." Such an attitude towards an extremely important issue in artistic creation should be considered a serious mistake.

Readers of *Soviet Art News* will easily find how contradictory and inconsistent various issues in dramatic creation, especially the issue of dramatic conflict, sometimes appear in the pages of this newspaper. This newspaper often expresses two completely opposite views, which shows that there is no clear position in the editorial department on the evaluation of those most important artistic works. This newspaper says one thing today and another thing tomorrow on the same issue, and when saying this and that, it does not bother itself to seriously and realistically find a basis for its conclusions and arguments, or to present arguments.

The editorial "Striving for a High Level of Dramatic Criticism" published by the *Soviet Art News* editorial department on April 5, 1952, stated: "In the actual work of our newspaper, there have been low demands, and there have been affirmative evaluations of very poor, and often anti-artistic works..." What exactly prevents the editorial department from adhering to a correct position when evaluating artistic works?

Even now, various issues in dramatic creation are still being discussed in the pages of *Soviet Art News*. But unfortunately, in some of the articles published in this newspaper and in important creative discussions, all are secretly replaced by some superficial discussions. Among these are particularly the two articles "Let's Talk Frankly..." by Virta and "Poetry Demands a Few Words" by Selivinsky, which will lead readers away from the real discussion of creative issues, and the solution of these creative issues is precisely what may help our dramatic creation overcome its lag.

The erroneous view on dramatic conflict is also reflected in the "Drama Creation Committee of the Soviet Writers' Union." When discussing this issue, some playwrights and critics have tried to prove that in plays depicting Soviet life, there should no longer be a place for real contradictions and conflicts. It is also affirmed that our entire cause has only one conflict left, a conflict between "good" and "better."

In this way, the diversity of life development has to be reduced to a formula. The result is to blur and obliterate the existing contradictions in our life, and to embellish reality. Those plays created according to the method of "dramatic creation without conflict" are lifeless. They cannot give Soviet people a correct concept of life, or of the communist characteristics that are increasingly maturing in their labor and daily life. They cannot arm readers and audiences to overcome difficulties, and cannot arouse people's thoughts and feelings.

The experience of those classical plays of the past and the outstanding works of Soviet dramatic creation points out that they are always based on the courageous reflection of the contradictions of reality and sharp conflicts. Only in the process of overcoming various real contradictions can people's various characters develop and be expressed.

The political and moral unity of the Soviet people, and the elimination of those antagonistic class contradictions in socialist society, have eliminated many old conflicts. But this does not mean that playwrights can use a quiet, leisurely, and sweet tone to express the life of the people as creators. Such affectionate hypocrisy is very embarrassing for Soviet playwrights.

For an artist, there is no greater crime than being afraid of the truth of life, and evading the description of life's contradictions. Describing the truth of life in its revolutionary development is the first golden rule of socialist realist art. "Write the truth," Comrade Stalin taught our writers.

Only true art can be truly ideological, and can have an impact on the hearts of millions of people. Comrade Stalin said: "It is very dangerous if we are infected with the disease of being afraid of the truth. But the Bolsheviks are different from other parties, they are not afraid of the truth, and they are not afraid to face the truth, no matter how bitter it is." Only those political parties that are declining and doomed to extinction are afraid of light and criticism. The Bolsheviks are neither afraid of light nor afraid of criticism, because they are a political party that is rising and heading towards victory. To write the truth means to observe and correctly reflect the development of reality, to reflect its various contradictions, and to reflect the struggle between the new and the old.

Soviet artists should explain all these processes from the standpoint of advanced thought. He should show the new force that can overcome everything, should defend it; should defend and support what is advancing, make it an example for millions of people, and actively help them cultivate those excellent characteristics of communist builders.

Comrade Stalin's famous saying on dialectics can be used as the key to understanding the active patriotic role of Soviet artists. He said that dialectics "often feels the pulse of life and says frankly: since life is changing rapidly and in a state of constant motion, then any life phenomenon has two trends - positive and negative, and between the two, we should support the former and reject the latter." Our playwrights should expose and relentlessly lash out at the remnants of capitalism and phenomena such as political apathy, bureaucracy, inertia, flattery, arrogance, complacency, selfishness, dishonest attitudes towards tasks accepted, and a lack of concern for socialist property, and expose all vulgar and backward things that hinder social progress.

When correctly reflecting the various shortcomings and contradictions existing in life, writers should at the same time actively affirm the positive principles of our socialist reality and help the new things to win. Those plays - in which the negative characters dominate, and the artistic methods used for their descriptions are more vivid and expressive than those for the positive characters - are absolutely intolerable.

The naive "theory" of dramatic creation without conflict and the naive creations based on this "theory" have become obstacles to the development of Soviet dramatic creation and the reason for its lag. Our playwrights and critics must now liquidate this impoverished and directly or indirectly advocated erroneous theory that dramatic creation without conflict is necessary.

The strength of Soviet drama lies in its ability to conform to the truth of life.

III.

From the shortcomings of those plays recently staged in our theaters, it can be determined how badly this whimsical "theory" of dramatic creation without conflict is affecting creation. Many of these plays depict interesting and important modern themes. But the performances of these plays may not have truly moved the audience, may not have truly become a bright event in their lives, and may not have truly helped them to more deeply understand the surrounding reality.

These shortcomings are most evident in Romashov's play "The Athletes of Moscow." The theme of the innovative work of the advanced people of socialist industry who are boldly realizing technological improvements has not received the artistic embodiment it deserves in this play. The conflict, the struggle between the new and the old, is replaced by the playwright with lengthy arguments between two Stakhanov workers over the details of technology. The author only tries to attract the audience with the further rationalization of accelerated iron forging, but at the same time does not show the characteristics of the advanced Soviet workers' character. Therefore, the creators of new things, our heroes, for whom labor has become true creation, give the impression of being pale and weak, and uninteresting. Their circle of interests is portrayed as very narrow, and they are portrayed as seeing nothing but their own workshops.

The play "Youth," co-written by Triphonov and Machevili, which is currently being staged at the Yermolova Theater, also fails to get any convincing embodiment and consistent development. This play does not have a unified plot center. The characters portrayed by the authors are not expressed in active action and real conflicts, and those characters are mostly weak and have little expression.

The erroneous "theory" of dramatic creation without conflict is leading the description of reality to an anti-realist, distorted, and one-sided road. Without the artistic embodiment of life conflicts, it is impossible to deeply and comprehensively express people's character. In most plays, the characters are impersonal, and are often so similar to each other that it is difficult to distinguish them. Our playwrights must deeply describe people's vivid character and personal characteristics.

The requirement of deeply individualizing the protagonist is one of the basic requirements of socialist realist aesthetics. Indifference to people, and attempts to generalize and equalize them, are contrary to the spirit of the Soviet system.

Comrade Stalin instructed:

"Socialism cannot ignore individual interests. Only a socialist society can give the greatest satisfaction to this individual interest. Moreover, only a socialist society is the only solid guarantee for protecting individual interests."

Only those real and vivid characters can attract the audience and convey the ideas of the work to them. But how many such plays are still being staged: in these plays, there are only some impersonal, few outstanding, no wisdom, no talent, unable to understand and without vivid, unforgettable character people, who are acting in the name of advanced Soviet people!

Livshitz, the author of the play "College Students," on the surface, he wanted to write a work about our extremely lovely young people, about their thoughts and feelings. But the audience failed to see the rich spiritual world of the college students from this play: the audience was hidden by the talk about the rural gas stove manufacturing plan that occupied too much space in the play. The author failed to handle each character vividly and with typical characteristics. The characters in the play are unforgettable.

Soviet audiences, who are very interested in drama, cannot be satisfied with those formulaic and superficial images, because the impression these images give is too far from the concept of the content-rich and multifaceted character of Soviet people.

The audience's requirement is to see complete artistic images of their contemporaries in Soviet plays.

One of the reasons for the weakness of our dramatic creation is that it only one-sidedly describes the life of Soviet people.

Recently, some plays have appeared, and the problem they have committed is the same as the problem committed by many prose works describing the working class and the collective farm peasants. In these works, only machinery is described, competition is talked about, and the completion of production plans is talked about. But in these works, people in daily life are not described, nor is their culture and spiritual world described.

But the working class and peasants of the Soviet state have become different people and live in a different way than before. They all live culturally and well-fed, and are characterized by their various spiritual requirements. But in many works, they are only represented one-sidedly, with no other interest than production-technology.

The author of the play "The Place Where the Pine Forest Rustles," Shcheglov, has all the possibilities to show the characteristics of the daily life of the Karelian lumberjacks, the world of thoughts and feelings of his protagonists, their spiritual requirements and interests, and their various and broad lives; but the entire thoughts of the characters in the play are swallowed up by the one thing of logging. Whether they visit each other, eat at the same table, or are busy with marriage, they are always inseparable from logging, tree-dragging tractors, and the rationalization of the work process.

For example, in the play, one of the heroines - Katrina, people ask her:

"Kaga, why do you come to us so little? I can't see you!"

Katrina (shrugging her shoulders): "Why should I come to you often? When Toivo Ivanich calls us, I go into the office and listen to him explain...about the work in the forest."

Lembi: "Is it just that? Don't sit down..."

Katrina: "Lembi, Mom, there is no time."

Lembi: "Now you are in the forest, and you don't talk to Anka."

Katrina: "There is nothing to talk about in the forest, Lembi, Mom. We are just busy turning around."

The characters in this play really don't talk about anything but the forest. Even a young girl, when she is waiting to meet her beloved, thinks this way: "Maybe, he is just like that...just wants to talk about work, talk about the forest?" And at the wedding, the newlyweds and guests also discuss the call for logging competition and the indicators of this competition. The author failed to see into people's daily life and inner life, and only hypocritically and poorly showed their circle of interests.

Due to the violation of the truth of life, the positive characters in many works are often portrayed as narrow-minded, one-sided characters. The far-reaching thinking and broad vision that are characteristic of advanced Soviet people are often not expressed enough in the protagonists in modern plays.

It should be emphatically pointed out that merely the one-sided description of the characters' production-technical activities is the result of simplifying and conceptualizing socialist realism. Socialist realism requires an artistic description of life and all its complex phenomena in a multifaceted and complete way, and first of all requires an artistic description of the richness of people's spiritual face.

One-sidedly describing people's life and ignoring their daily life and culture fully shows that the artist's understanding of life is not deep enough. Describing technology and narrating competitions can be done after several relevant workshops or collective farm visits, based on materials obtained from the director's office. But if a literary worker wants to describe well the daily life, culture, spiritual requirements and interests of the Soviet people, then he has to do more: he has to deeply study the life of workers and peasants, and deeply study their daily life. Playwrights must use all methods to develop the outstanding and excellent characteristics of Soviet literature: a caring and concerned attitude towards describing the Soviet people - all our victorious creators.

Not being good at expressing the protagonist in action, using high-sounding lines and nonsense to replace action, and taking a sloppy attitude towards the handling of the characters' language, the structure of the play, and its strong plot development will all affect the quality of the play. Therefore, improving the artistic skills of expressing real contradictions and character has now become the most important condition for the further rise of Soviet dramatic creation.

IV.

The tasks of Soviet playwrights have long been stipulated in detail in many instructions of the Party, in the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Repertoire of Theaters and the Methods of Its Improvement" and in other resolutions on ideological work issues. The Party calls on dramatic creation and stage art workers to focus their main attention on establishing a modern Soviet repertoire of performances, and to create works that are of full value in terms of ideology and artistry that describe Soviet social life and describe Soviet people.

The people are waiting for those plays that can be firmly and permanently arranged in the theater's performance repertoire alongside the works of classical writers. These plays should attract theaters and audiences with the novelty of themes and real materials and the high level of writing skills.

Learning writing skills, seriously, stubbornly, and constantly learning - this is the main and extremely important thing for each of our creators at present. The diversity of genres should be developed in our dramatic creation, and more boldly create satirical plays and beautiful and pleasant comedies that have not been given due attention by writers.

Soviet public opinion has the right to demand that the "Committee on Arts Affairs" and the "Soviet Writers' Union" pay more attention to establishing a highly artistic performance repertoire for each theater. The "Committee on Arts Affairs" and the theaters have not yet established a real modern performance repertoire creation plan. Truly creative debates and public discussions of new dramatic works should be widely used.

It is important to strengthen the contact and cooperation between theaters and writers in various ways. The relationship between theaters and playwrights should be truly creative, principled, and demanding. It cannot but attract people's attention that actors and stage artists often do not connect with the work of playwrights.

The criticism of the dramatic world has not yet put the issue of artistic skills, and the issue of the playwrights' ability to fully adapt to the reality of life when creating scripts, into the center of their attention. The shortcomings pointed out in the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Repertoire of Theaters and the Methods of Its Improvement" have not been completely eliminated. Those superficial, casually written, and rarely helpful articles and reviews for the development of Soviet dramatic creation continue to appear in our newspapers and magazines.

Principled, Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism must be carried out, because this criticism and self-criticism are the decisive conditions for improving the ideological and artistic level of artistic works, and are important tools for fighting against crude works and preventing errors in creative work.

The Party calls on all literary and art workers to become more and more proficient in their writing skills and to improve the ideological and artistic level of their creations. The vigorous labor of writers and drama workers, and the struggle to implement the instructions of the Party and Comrade Stalin, will certainly guarantee the further rise of Soviet dramatic creation and Soviet stage art.

    克服戏剧创作的落后现象
    苏联“真理报”专论
    一
    苏维埃戏剧创作，是我国先进的社会主义文化不可分割的一部分。苏维埃舞台艺术的发展，完全要看戏剧创作的情形如何而定。苏维埃戏剧创作的进步、革新的意义，就在于它在真实的艺术形象身上反映我们的社会主义现实，肯定现代最先进的思想，宣传苏维埃国家的政策。
    苏维埃戏剧创作在历史上破天荒第一次地把新的人物——自由劳动的、建立了新生活并做了它的真正主人翁的人搬上了舞台。
    承继并创造地发扬着俄国古典戏剧创作的优秀传统，沿着社会主义的现实主义道路前进，苏维埃作家生产了不少出色的作品，创造了一些苏维埃经典戏剧创作的范例。高尔基的戏剧创作，在我国舞台艺术发展中起了卓越的作用。在苏维埃时代，高尔基曾写了几个经典的剧本：“耶果尔·布雷曹夫和其他的人”，“妥斯奇加耶夫和其他的人”。高尔基的作品，为我们在戏剧创作中确立社会主义的现实主义铺下了道路。
    特列涅夫的“柳苞维·亚罗瓦雅”，伊万诺夫的“铁甲列车”，拉夫列鸟夫的“缺口”，比里·别洛柴尔科夫斯基的“海上风暴”等剧本都获得了广泛的赞许，并帮助了苏联剧院戏目单的形成。在战后时期，又出现了这一类作品，如罗马索夫的“伟大的力量”，西蒙诺夫的“俄罗斯问题”，拉夫列鸟夫的“美国的声音”和“祝福海上的人们”，柯纳楚克的“玛加尔·杜布拉娃”，维斯涅夫斯基的
    “难忘的一九一九”，索弗罗诺夫的“莫斯科性格”，苏罗夫的“绿街”，克拉比娃的“云雀在歌唱”，亚科布逊的“两个阵营”，以及其他剧本。
    我们的日益蓬勃发展的生活，不断向艺术提出新的、更高的任务。苏维埃人民的文化水平，天天在提高，因此他们对于艺术的要求，也就不断地在提高。
    苏维埃作家应当把我们戏剧创作的思想、艺术水平也提得更高，把自己同时代人的多方面的生活表现得更完满。可是，我们的那些剧作家，对于摆在他们面前的任务，都执行得很差。
    首都各剧院在目前戏剧节上演的戏目单中，观众就找不到以现代苏维埃为主题的、鲜明而富有重大意义的剧本。在各剧院演出的新戏中，苏维埃人今天的生活并没有得到它应有的艺术体现。戏剧创作的状况，目前还不能适合于人民和党的要求。
    绝不能说，我们并没有以伟大而重要的现代为主题的剧本。不，那样的剧本并不少。但是在我们的剧作家所创作的大量的剧本中，只有为数不多的几个能够上演。从现有的剧本的量和质显然不相称这一点看来，可以说明许多剧作家的工作方向，都是不正确的。
    大多数剧院的戏目单，都很少有好的剧本来加以补充。要每一家话剧院都至少要上演两个到三个用现代作主题的质量好的戏这一指定的任务，都还没有完成。那末，这种情形就会常常把许多具有高度才能的舞台艺术人员的努力化为乌有，也就不足为奇了。
    戏剧的创作落后于人民的日益提高的要求，可以从国内的几个最大的剧院上演的戏目单中看出来，如莫斯科艺术剧院、小剧院、列宁格勒的普希金剧院以及其他一些剧院的戏目单，都不能令人满意。还有几个加盟共和国的一些剧院的戏目单，也同样不能令人满意。戏剧创作的落后现象，是十分严重地影响了各地剧院的工作。
    当授予一九五一年的斯大林奖金时，苏维埃戏剧创作没有一个获得头等奖和二等奖，而只有两个剧本获得三等奖，这一点不能不引起苏联人的注意。
    苏维埃文学，拥有不少有才能的、熟练的剧作家干部。在我国已为艺术创作创造了一些有利的条件。苏维埃人的有内容的、精神饱满的生活，会给艺术家以无限的材料来创作出社会主义的现实主义的杰出作品。苏联的作家们，有克服戏剧创作的暂时的落后现象的全部可能性。
    在究明引起戏剧创作落后现象的原因时，必须指出“苏联作家协会理事会”和“艺术事业委员会”两方面对排定剧院戏目单的指导上的弱点。但是主要的、决定性的原因，还是由于一些剧作家和批评家对于社会主义的现实主义的理论和实践的某些问题，首先是对于作为戏剧作品基础的冲突这一问题，理解得不正确。
    二
    剧作家和舞台艺术工作人员的最重要的任务，就是反映出苏维埃人的精神饱满，反映出他们在创造性的劳动和为建设共产主义社会而斗争的过程中所显示的性格上的一些卓越的特征；颂扬我们祖国的伟大和威力、颂扬全世界的自由、和平和民主的日益增长的力量及其和反动、战争以及黑暗势力的破坏力量所进行的斗争。
    一个真正懂得生活、对周围一切事物能作深思熟虑的观察的艺术家，是不可能看不到：在共产主义建设者的道路上，常常会碰到一些阻碍、困难、冲突以及一些严重的、现实的矛盾，要克服这些东西，就要求巨大的努力和自己的爱国主义天职的高度觉悟。新事物和旧事物的斗争，就常常在生活中引起各式各样的冲突。没有这些冲突就没有生活，因而也就没有了艺术。
    戏剧创作贫乏的主要原因，许多剧本的弱点，都是由于剧作家没有用那些深刻的、生活中的冲突来做自己作品的基础，反而放过了它们。要是根据这一类的剧本来判断的话，那就是说，我们一切都是美好的，理想的，已经没有任何冲突了。若干剧作家认为，他们几乎已不许可批评我们生活中的不好的、否定的事物了。而另外一些批评家则要求，在艺术作品中只许表现理想的、完美的典型，要是作家和剧作家表现生活中现有的否定事物，那他就要大受批评。
    用这种态度去看问题是不对的。这么办——就是表示怯弱，就是在真理面前犯罪。
    我们并不是一切都理想都完美得很了，我们还存在着一些否定的典型。在我们的生活中，恶事还不少，虚伪的人也还不少。我们不能怕暴露缺点和困难。有毛病必须医治。我们需要果戈理和锡且德林那样的人。什么地方没有运动、没有发展，那个地方才没有毛病。而我们却正在发展和向前运动着，这就是说，无论是困难或缺点，我们都还有。
    戏剧创作就应当指出生活里的冲突，没有这一点也就没有了戏剧创作。
    应当指出，文学和戏剧的批评都是不称职的。近年来盛行着一种消除冲突的庸俗的“理论”，这种“理论”，有害地影响了剧作家的创作工作。按照这种所谓“理论”的创始者们的意见，正是“没有冲突”，才应当是苏维埃剧本最道地的特点。
    事情弄到了这种地步——“苏维埃艺术报”竟把戏剧冲突的问题轻蔑而讽刺地叫作“轰动一时的问题”。用这种态度去对待艺术创作上极端重要的问题，应当认为是一种严重的错误。
    “苏维埃艺术报”的读者不难发现，戏剧创作上的各种问题，尤其是戏剧冲突的问题，有时是如何矛盾地和不一贯地出现在这个报纸的篇幅上。这个报纸时常表示两种完全相反的观点，这就可以说明在编辑部里对于那些最重要的艺术作品的评价，没有显明的立场。这个报纸对于同一问题，今天是这样说，明天又那样说，而在这样说和那样说的时候，都又不肯麻烦自己去认真地、实事求是地为自己的结论和论断找根据，提出论证。
    “苏维埃艺术报”编辑部于一九五二年四月五日所发表的社论“争取戏剧批评的高度水平”中，这样说道：“在我们这个报纸的实际工作中，是有过要求不高、是有过对很差的，而往往又是反艺术的作品予以肯定评价的……”究竟是什么东西妨碍了编辑部在对艺术作品予以评价时，不坚持正确的立场呢？
    就是目前，在“苏维埃艺术报”的篇幅上，也还在讨论着戏剧创作的各种问题。不过很可惜，在这个报纸上所发表的一些论文中和重要的创作讨论中，都全为一些肤浅的议论所偷偷地代替了。这其中特别是维尔达的“我们坦白地谈谈……”和塞里文斯基的“诗歌要求说几句话”两篇论文，会把读者由创作问题的现实讨论引开，而这些创作问题的解决，又正是可能帮助我们的戏剧创作克服它的落后现象的。
    关于戏剧冲突的错误观点，也表现在“苏联作家协会戏剧创作委员会”里面。当讨论这个问题时，有若干剧作家和批评家都企图证明，在描写苏维埃生活的剧本中，已经不应当再有现实矛盾和冲突的地位。又肯定地说，我们的整个事业，已经只剩下了一个“好”和“更好”之间的冲突了。
    这么一来，生活发展的多样性，就都只好迁就一个公式了。其结果就是模糊、抹煞我们生活中现有的矛盾，粉饰现实。那些根据“没有冲突的戏剧创作”的方法而创作的剧本，都是没有生气的。它们不能给予苏维埃人生活，给予他们在劳动和日常生活中日益成熟的共产主义特征以正确的概念。它们不能武装读者和观众去克服困难，不能唤起人们的思想和感情。
    过去的那些古典剧本和苏维埃戏剧创作的优秀作品的经验指出，它们永远都是建立在勇敢地反映现实的矛盾和尖锐的冲突上的。唯其是在这种克服各种现实矛盾的过程中，人的各种性格才能够发展和表现出来。
    苏维埃人的政治和道德的一致，社会主义社会中的那些对立的阶级矛盾的消灭，是使许多旧的冲突消除了。但是这绝不等于说，剧作家们，可以用安静闲逸的、甜蜜的笔调去表现人民——创造者的生活。像这种温情的虚伪，是非常使苏维埃剧作家丢面子的。
    对于一个艺术家来说，再没有比害怕生活的真实，逃避生活矛盾的描写更大的罪过了。在生活的革命的发展中，描写它的真实——这是社会主义的现实主义艺术的第一条金科玉律。“写真实吧”，——斯大林同志这样教导我们的作家。
    只有真实的艺术，才能够是真正有思想性的，才能够对千万人的心灵有影响。斯大林同志说：“假使我们传染上害怕真理的毛病，那是很危险的。可是，布尔什维克就和其他的党不同，他们就不害怕真理，不害怕正视真理，无论它是多么苦。”只有那些日趋没落的、注定灭亡的政党才害怕光明和批评。布尔什维克既不害怕光明，也不害怕批评，其所以不害怕的原因，就是因为他们是一个日益上升的、走向胜利的政党。写真实——这就是说观察并正确地反映现实的发展，反映它的各种矛盾，反映新事物和旧事物的斗争。
    苏维埃艺术家，要站在先进的思想立场来阐明所有这些过程。他应当显示出那个能战胜一切的新的力量，应当保卫它；应当卫护、支持前进的东西，把它做成千千万万人的榜样，积极地帮助他们，在他们的身上培养出共产主义建设者的那些优秀的特征。
    斯大林同志论辩证法的一段名言，可以拿来作为理解苏维埃艺术家积极爱国作用的关键。他说，辩证法“常常感觉到生活脉搏的跳动并率真地说：既然生活在迅速地变化和处于不断运动的状态中，那末，任何一种生活现象就都有两种趋向——肯定的和否定的，在这两者之间，我们应当拥护前者，而摒弃后者。”我们的剧作家就应当去揭露并无情地鞭挞资本主义的残余和不关心政治、官僚主义、因循、阿谀逢迎、骄横自满、自高自大、自私自利、对所接受的任务抱着不老实的态度、对社会主义财产采取不爱护的态度等现象，揭露一切庸俗的和妨碍社会前进的落后的东西。
    在正确地反映生活中现有的各种缺点和矛盾时，作家应当同时积极地确定我们社会主义现实的肯定的原则，帮助新事物取得胜利。对于那些剧本——其中都是由反面人物占着优势，而且对于他们的描写比起对于正面人物的描写所用的艺术方法更鲜明、更富于表情，是绝对不能容忍的。
    没有冲突的戏剧创作的幼稚的“理论”和根据这种“理论”而产生的幼稚的创作，已成了苏维埃戏剧创作发展的阻碍和它的所以落后的原因。我们的剧作家和批评家，现在都必须要清算这种贫乏的、直接间接主张没有冲突的戏剧创作之必要的错误理论。
    苏维埃戏剧的力量，就是在于它能符合于生活的真实。
    三
    从最近在我们剧院上演的那些剧本的缺点来看，就可以确定，这种异想天开的没有冲突的戏剧创作“理论”，是如何不好地在影响着创作。这些剧本，其中有许多都是描写有兴趣的、重要的现代主题的。但是这些剧本的演出，却未必就真正感动了观众，未必就真正成了他们生活中一个鲜明的事件，未必就真正帮助了他们更深刻地认识周围的现实。
    这些缺点，在罗目科夫的剧本“莫斯科的健儿们”中，表现得最为显著。大胆地实现着技术改进的、社会主义工业先进人们革新工作的主题，并没有在这个剧本中得到应有的艺术体现。冲突、新事物和旧事物的斗争，都被剧作家用两个斯达哈诺夫工作者对工艺学的细节的冗长的争执所代替了。作者只在企图用加速锻铁法的进一步合理化去吸引观众，但同时却没有显示出先进的苏维埃工人性格的那些特征。因此，新事物的创造者，我们的英雄，对于他们来说，劳动已经成为真正的创造了，而结果他们给人的印象却是苍白无力，叫人不感兴趣。他们的兴趣的圈子，被表现得十分狭隘，他们被表现得除了自己车间以外的事情，就什么也看不见。
    由特里洪诺夫和迈斯赫切里合写的那个目前正在耶尔莫洛娃剧院上演的剧本“青年时代”，也得不到一点能令人折服的体现和一贯的发展。这个剧本没有统一的情节的中心。由作者所刻画的性格，并没有在积极的行动过程中和现实的冲突中表现出来，那些性格多半都是软弱无力，很少富于表情。
    没有冲突的戏剧创作的错误的“理论”，正把现实的描写，引向反现实主义的、歪曲的、片面的道路。没有生活冲突的艺术体现，是绝不可能深刻地、全面地表现人的性格的。在大多数的剧本中，人物都是没有个性的，彼此常常是那样地相似，以至使人难以分辨。我们的剧作家们，必须深刻地描写人们生动的性格和个人的特点。
    把主人公深刻地个性化的要求，这是社会主义现实主义美学的基本要求之一。对于人漠不关心，企图把他们一般化、均衡化，这都是和苏维埃制度精神背道而驰的。
    斯大林同志指示说：
    “社会主义不能撇开个人的兴趣。能给这种个人兴趣以最大满足的，也只有社会主义社会才行。不但如此，也只有社会主义社会，才是保护个人兴趣的唯一牢固的保障。”
    只有那些真实的、生动的性格才能够吸引观众，才能够把作品的思想传达给他们。但是现在倒还有多少这样的剧本在上演：在这些剧本里，都只是一些没有个性的、很少出色之处的、没有智慧、没有才能、不会感悟以及没有鲜明的令人难以忘怀的性格的人们，在冒着先进的苏维埃人的名义活动！
    里弗希赤，剧本“大学生”的作者，从表面上看来，他倒是想写一部关于我们极端可爱的青年们，关于他们的思想和感情的作品。但是观众并未能从这个剧本里看到大学生的丰富的精神世界：观众都被在剧本中占了太多篇幅的乡村煤气炉制造方案的谈话所隐蔽了。作者未能够把每一个人物都处理得生动而富有典型的特征。剧中的人物，竟使人不能记忆。
    对戏剧抱着巨大兴趣的苏维埃观众，对于那些公式化的、浅薄的形象，是怎样也不能满足的，因为这些形象给人的印象，和苏维埃人的内容丰富和多方面性格的概念相差得太远。
    观众的要求，是想在苏维埃剧本中看到自己同时代人的完整的艺术形象。
    我们戏剧创作弱点的原因之一，就是只片面地描写苏维埃人的生活。
    近来出现了一些剧本，它们所犯的毛病，也正就是许多描写工人阶级和集体农庄的农民的散文作品所犯的毛病。在这些作品里，只描写机械、谈竞赛、谈完成生产计划。但是在这些作品里却不描写日常生活中的人们，不描写他们的文化和精神世界。
    可是苏维埃国家的工人阶级和农民都已经变成了另一种人，并且用一种跟以前不同的方式生活着了。他们都是有文化地、丰衣足食地生活着，以自己的各种各样的精神上的要求而显其特色。但是在许许多多作品中，他们却都只是片面地被表现着，除了生产——技术之外，就毫无其他任何兴趣。
    剧本“松林飒飒的地方”的作者希切格洛夫是拥有全部的可能去表现卡列里亚伐木工人日常生活的特点、自己主人公的思想和感情的世界、他们的精神上的要求和兴趣以及他们各色各样的，广泛的生活的；但是剧中登场人物的全部思想，都为伐木一件事情所吞没了。他们互相作客也好，同桌吃饭也好，忙着办婚姻大事也好，——总是离不了伐木、拖树的拖拉机以及工作过程的合理化。
    例如剧中女主人公之一——卡特琳娜，人们这样问她：
    “卡加，为什么你这样少到我们这儿来？简直就见不到你呀！”
    卡特琳娜（耸了耸肩）：“干吗要常到你们这儿来呢？当托伊沃·伊万尼赤叫唤我们的时候，我就走进办公室，听他向我们解释……关于森林的工作。”
    列姆比：“只是单纯地那样吗？就不坐一坐………”
    卡特琳娜：“列姆比妈妈，没有时间呵。”
    列姆比：“现在你就是在森林里，也不和安卡谈话。”
    卡特琳娜：“在森林里我们没有什么好谈的，列姆比妈妈。我们只是转来转去地忙着。”
    这个剧本里的人物，真地都是除了森林，就什么都不谈。甚至连一个少女，当她在等候着和心爱的人见面的时候，也是这么想：“也许，他只是那样……只想谈谈工作，谈谈关于森林的事？”还有在举行婚礼时，新婚的夫妇和客人们，也要讨论伐木竞赛的号召和这个竞赛的指标。作者未能洞察人们的日常生活和内心生活，只是虚伪地、贫乏地、表现他们的兴趣的圈子。
    由于违反生活的真实，所以正面人物在许多作品中就都时常被表现成眼光狭小的、片面性的人物。如为先进的苏维埃人所特具的那种深远的思维和远大的眼光，在现代的那些剧本中的主人公身上，就常常都表现得不够。
    应当着重地指出，仅仅只是人物的生产——技术活动的片面的描写，这是把社会主义的现实主义简单化、概念化了的结果。社会主义的现实主义，是要求对生活及其全部复杂的现象，多方面地、充分地予以艺术的描写，首先是要求对于人的精神面貌的丰富予以艺术的描写。
    片面地描写人的生活，忽视他的日常生活和文化，这都充分表现出艺术家对生活的认识不够深刻。描写技术，叙述竞赛，都可以在几次有关的车间或是集体农庄访问之后，根据从主任办公室拿来的材料就行了。但是，一个文学工作者要想很好地描写苏维埃人的日常生活、文化、精神上的要求和兴趣，那他就要做得更多：他就得深刻地研究工人和农民的生活，深刻地研究他们的日常生活。剧作家们都务须用一切方法去发扬苏维埃文学的出色的、卓越的特征：对于描写苏维埃人——我们所有的胜利的创造者——所持有的爱护而关心的态度。
    不善于在行动中表现主人公，用高谈阔论的台词和废话以代替行动，对剧中人物的语言、剧本的结构以及它的强有力的情节发展的处理都采取马马虎虎的态度，这都会使剧本的质量受影响的。因此提高表现现实矛盾和性格的艺术技巧，目前已成为苏维埃戏剧创作进一步上升的最主要的条件。
    四
    苏维埃剧作家的任务，在党的许多指示中，在联共（布）中央委员会的“关于各剧院演出的戏目及其改进的办法”的决议中和另外一些关于思想工作问题的决议中，都早就规定得详尽无遗了。党号召戏剧创作和舞台艺术工作者都要把主要的注意力集中起来去建立现代苏维埃演出的戏目，在创作在思想性和艺术性方面都是描写苏维埃社会生活、描写苏维埃人的有充分价值的作品。
    人民正在期待着那些能够牢固地、长久地和古典作家们的作品共同排列在剧院演出的戏目单上的剧本。这些剧本，应当以主题和现实材料的新颖以及高度水平的写作技巧去吸引剧院和观众。
    学习写作技巧，认真地，顽强地、不断地学习——这就是我们每一个创作家目前主要的和极关重要的事情。应当在我们戏剧创作中发展其体裁的多样性，更大胆地去创造一些还未为作家们予以应有的注意的讽刺剧和美好而使人愉快的喜剧。
    苏维埃舆论界有权利要求“艺术事业委员会”和
    “苏联作家协会”对于建立各剧院的高度艺术的戏目单予以更大的注意。“艺术事业委员会”和各剧院，到目前为止都还没有建立起一个真正的现代戏目单创作计划。应当广泛地运用真正富有创造性的辩论和新戏剧作品的公共讨论。
    重要的是用各种方法加强剧院跟作家们的联系与合作。剧院和剧作家之间的相互关系，应当是真正富有创造性的、原则性的、求全责备的。这样的事情不能不使人注意——演员们，舞台艺术工作人员们，就常常和剧作家的工作不接头。
    戏剧界的批评，还没有把艺术技巧问题，把剧作家们创作剧本时能和生活的现实完全适应的描写手腕等问题，放到自己注意的中心上。在联共（布）中央委员会的“关于各剧院演出的戏目及其改进办法”的决定中所指出的缺点，还未能彻底根除。在我们的报刊上还继续不断地出现那些浅薄的、随随便便写的，很少能有助于苏维埃戏剧创作发展的论文和评论文章。
    必须展开原则性的、布尔什维克的批评和自我批评，因为这种批评和自我批评是提高艺术作品的思想——艺术水平的决定性的条件，是和粗劣作品作斗争及预防创作工作中发生错误的重要工具。
    党号召要所有的文学艺术工作者都愈益娴熟自己的写作技巧，提高创作的思想——艺术水平。作家和戏剧工作者的奋发的劳动，为实现党和斯大林同志的指示而进行的斗争，一定能保证苏维埃戏剧创作，苏维埃舞台艺术的更进一步的上升。
