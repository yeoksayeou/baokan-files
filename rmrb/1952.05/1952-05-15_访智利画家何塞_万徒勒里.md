Visiting Chilean Painter José Venturelli

The Chilean painter José Venturelli came to China at the invitation of the China Peace Committee. In over a month, he visited Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. He marveled at the magnificence of the Yangtze River at Yanzi Rock; he also discussed with our artists in Shanghai how art can better serve the people. In early May, he returned to the capital and attended the grand commemorative meetings for Avicenna, da Vinci, Hugo, and Gogol. On a joyful May night filled with friendship, reporters interviewed this friend and honored guest of the Chinese people.

He had just returned from a banquet and immediately received us. Near the window of the room was a low rectangular table, surrounded by a set of sofas. The table was piled with several cloth-bound thread-stitched copies of "Biographies of the Sages," "Dunhuang Murals," and some books and photographs introducing China. He introduced us to his wife; everyone sat around the long table. Mrs. Venturelli warmly greeted everyone, offering cigarettes.

Venturelli slightly tidied the books on the table, making some space, opened his notebook, lit a cigarette, and began to answer our questions.

"Latin American art is currently a struggle between two tendencies," he said. "One is the revolutionary realist tendency; this is closely integrated with the Latin American people, fighting for national independence, fighting to defend peace, and opposing imperialism and feudalism. The other is the decadent formalist tendency." Venturelli explained the revolutionary realist art of Chile in two aspects. First, this is an art built on a national foundation. The struggle against formalism is essentially a struggle for cultural independence. Under the imperialist intrusion into Latin America, Latin American art has also been deeply influenced by imperialism. American imperialism has spent millions of dollars building so-called modern art galleries in various countries, promoting formalist art, with the aim of using decadent art to overwhelm the people's art. Therefore, the struggle for artistic independence must be built on the foundation of the people and the nation. Latin American artists are seeking national forms that can express the life and struggles of their people. Second, revolutionary art from the beginning is combined with the people; revolutionary national art is an expression of the working-class struggle. In the nineteenth century, Latin American art was still bourgeois and petty-bourgeois art. But when imperialist forces invaded and combined with feudal forces, this art was destroyed with the decline of the bourgeoisie. In the twentieth century, the working class rose, influencing culture and art; this produced the art of anti-imperialists and anti-colonialists. "The intention of our revolutionary art circles is to express the efforts of the people to strive for national independence. Regardless of imperialist persecution, artists are still with the people, fighting for national independence and freedom. This kind of art plays a very important role among the people."

Such art, produced by the people and serving the people, is bound to be loved and cherished by the people. Although, due to economic constraints, many people in South America still remain outside the cultural sphere, the people that art reaches are still very broad. Conversely, formalists are extremely isolated. Their audience is only a small group of reactionaries. The gathering place of these degenerate artists is the "Modern Art Gallery" – a directly managed branch of the "galleries" and "museums" of New York; and the latter is the private property of American bosses. The degenerate elements gathered in the "Modern Art Gallery" live on the alms of American dollars. Such a "Modern Art Gallery" cannot succeed, because they only support a group of formalists who cannot reach the people and cannot reach life.

American bosses have spent a lot of money to try to buy the artists of the people, but they have not succeeded. The artists have not been bought and live the same hard lives as the people. Because of this, they have independent creation and style, and are able to represent the people; and because of this, they are able to represent the true culture of South America.

II

The topic turned to Venturelli's visit to New China.

In Shanghai, he exchanged painting experiences with our artists, exchanged information about the art circles of the two countries, and discussed some issues based on seeking artistic forms that better serve the people. In fundamental issues, in the goals of effort, and in the general direction and path, the art circles of China and Chile, he said, are completely consistent. "The creative experience of Chinese artists," he continued, "is very beneficial to us. I want to take it back to Chile. It will be of great help to the activities of the Chilean art circles." He said that this contact was the first direct contact between the art circles of China and Chile and will be the beginning of more extensive contacts and exchanges. He said that in his short trip he saw the high political level of artistic creation in New China; among them, he especially admired the woodcuts of New China, which have had a significant impact on South America. He humbly said that he wanted to learn from New China.

From the north, from the south, from the cities, from the countryside, the painter Venturelli gained two extremely profound impressions: the Chinese people love peace; the Chinese people are enthusiastic about building New China. Whether it was the worker on the lathe or the farmer in the paddy field, they all pointed out one thing to him: they are working hard to build their own country on a peaceful and happy land. He earnestly stated that the Chinese people's actions to defend peace also defend the peace of Chile; the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary experience has also helped the Chilean people's revolution. Therefore, he said, "Our people regard China as a very good friend in the anti-imperialist defense of world peace... At the same time, seeing New China is like seeing our future."

Therefore, when he saw the evidence of the American aggressors conducting bacteriological warfare, he, like our people, uttered voices of anger and hatred.

"A few days ago, I went with my French and Italian friends to see the exhibition of the crimes of American imperialism's bacteriological warfare," Venturelli told the reporters. "At the exhibition, I saw very comprehensive evidence. This evidence clearly exposes the heinous faces of the war criminals who are exterminating humanity. In Chile, our people dare not believe that American imperialism has such great crimes. Therefore, such an exhibition is particularly important. But, despite the American aggressors' best efforts to conceal their evil deeds, the people's protests are growing louder and louder. After these pieces of evidence are made public, this protest will be even greater. In order to isolate the war criminals, this evidence must be made known to as many people as possible, and also unfolded before the American people themselves."

He continued, "This exhibition not only provides materials, but also illustrates the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against bacteriological warfare. The Chinese people's contribution to the people of the world is enormous; they have not only blocked bacteriological warfare, but also awakened the people of the world."

At the exhibition, Venturelli not only saw the ironclad evidence of American imperialism's bacteriological warfare, but also saw the origin of American imperialism's preparation for bacteriological warfare. He saw that these demons had prepared for it a long time ago; not only materially, but also ideologically and spiritually. He saw the process of the American aggressors illegally releasing and colluding with Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals to carry out this criminal act. He angrily said, "For all this, the American government and bacteriological war criminals must bear full responsibility. They should be brought before the people of the world to be judged and punished. By that time, no one will release them the way they released the Japanese war criminals."

III

Reporters were eager to know the situation of the Latin American people defending peace, but it was already past midnight. Fearing that our guest was too tired, we discussed whether to move the interview to the next day. However, Venturelli sincerely said, "I will never feel tired about such an important issue." The conversation continued.

The poisonous claws of American imperialism tightly control the entire Latin America; although the specific situation in each country is different, the suppression of peace fighters is particularly severe. In most Latin American countries, the peace movement is even illegal. In the remaining countries, although its legality is recognized on the surface, peace fighters are still persecuted. Pro-peace marches and rallies are prohibited; pro-peace opinions in newspapers and publications are prohibited; even those who collect peace signatures are arrested. However, Latin American peace fighters still insisted on the open struggle. Regardless of police persecution, they bravely fought for the legal rights to strive for and defend peace. They would rather be arrested in the streets for peace than let the peace movement go underground due to persecution. They defended peace with their actions. Many peace fighters have been imprisoned for this reason, but the Latin American peace movement is rising higher day by day. People are increasingly aware that the struggle to defend peace and the struggle to strive for democracy and independence are closely related.

The policy of warmongers is also a policy of impoverishing and starving the people, and suppressing peace and democracy. The arms race has brought a heavy burden to Latin America. The Latin American people have seen clearly that the purpose of American imperialism is to push them into the abyss of misery and poverty, and to slaughter peaceful people; therefore, the peace movement is rising. The warmongers' conspiracy to push the people into war adventures has not succeeded.

Venturelli cited an example. When American imperialism began to invade Korea, it attempted to mobilize the Latin American people to participate in this criminal act. They portrayed the war of aggression against Korea as a trip, an opportunity to make a fortune, to deceive recruits. But immediately a massive anti-war movement broke out spontaneously among the people, the scale of which and its universality far exceeded the scope of what was organized. For example, when the Argentine government attempted to recruit soldiers to send to Korea, Argentine women spontaneously marched from all over to the capital, holding large demonstrations and shouting, "We oppose sending soldiers to Korea!" This demonstration became the largest peace movement in Argentine history.

Under the vigorous propaganda of American imperialism and its puppets, in Latin America with a population of 150 million, only one country sent troops to Korea—the most backward Colombia, with only two thousand people, and they were all hooligans and professional beggars. There were originally four thousand people, Venturelli said with a smile, and on the way from the capital to the port, two thousand people deserted with rifles and equipment. The reactionary government suffered no small losses and had to hurriedly and secretly put the remaining two thousand people on the ship overnight, without even having time to hold the originally planned "grand" ceremony. "Today," Venturelli said, "it is difficult to pull together even such two thousand people."

The peace signature campaign is becoming more and more powerful, making American imperialism and its puppets terrified. They are doing everything possible to suppress peace gatherings and stifle the people's calls for peace. At the beginning of this year, Latin America held a pan-American peace conference, and peace fighters from various Latin American countries enthusiastically launched a preparatory movement. American imperialism and its puppets, fearing the success of this peace conference, used various means to prevent the conference from being held in Brazil, Argentina, or Chile as planned. However, the conference was finally held in the capital of Uruguay; although it had to be forced to be held semi-openly due to police persecution. "This shows the weakness of the puppets and the strength of the forces of peace," Venturelli said. "They are truly afraid of the American people gathering together to discuss the issue of peace on this continent."

The conference showed the firm will of the American people to defend peace. They oppose arms expansion, oppose atomic bombs and other weapons of mass murder (including biological weapons); demand peace, demand national independence, demand a change in the tragic fate of the people.

"Today, we Latin American people, especially the people of the Pacific coastal countries, are eagerly looking forward to the convening of the Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference," Venturelli said. "This is because we uphold the principle of peaceful coexistence and recognize that peace is indivisible. We understand that American imperialism's rearmament of Japan, delaying and obstructing the Korean armistice negotiations, and conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, have seriously jeopardized world peace. Secondly, we support the restoration and development of normal trade relations between countries and the free exchange of culture. Therefore, we sincerely welcome this Asia and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, which includes the countries of the west coast of the Americas. The people of the west coast of the Americas have all established preparatory committees and enthusiastically support the preparatory meeting to be held in Beijing soon."

"American imperialism's aggression against Asia means aggression against Latin America," Venturelli concluded. "Thanks to the heroic resistance of the Chinese people, the flames of war have now been contained. The Latin American people resolutely oppose bacteriological warfare. When more evidence of American imperialism's bacteriological warfare is made public to them, the protest movement will surely expand and deepen. All this evidence is a helpful force for us. It helps us expose to the people American imperialism's purpose of trying to destroy all mankind. All this will increasingly strengthen the determination of our people to oppose imperialism and strive for national independence. The peace movement will become more powerful, and we Latin American people will never allow our resources to be used for the criminal purpose of destroying mankind."

IV

After a busy day of visits, seminars, meetings, banquets... José Venturelli still made a nearly five-hour talk to us despite his exhaustion, and I was deeply moved by his spirit. I recalled his revolutionary experience from the publications—

He is an excellent communist, a peace fighter, and an artist of the people. He was elected chairman of the Chilean National Student Union (1943), served as secretary-general of the "League of Intellectuals for the Defense of Culture" (1945), served as editor of the Chilean Communist Party's newspaper "Century" and secretary of the Secretariat of the Chilean Communist Party's National Cultural Policy Committee, and is now a member of the Chilean Peace Committee. Last November, he represented Chilean peace fighters at the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council. He is engaged in the creation of woodcuts, copper engravings, oil paintings, and propaganda paintings; he has created illustrations for many of Neruda's poems.

At our request, Venturelli showed us his creations, mainly prints. The first batch was illustrations for Neruda's poem "The Dead in the Square"; the second batch was works denouncing the desert concentration camps [Note 1]; the third batch was the original manuscript of illustrations for Neruda's poetry collection "Canto General." From these pictures, I saw miners, fishermen, mothers and children in the desert waiting to die, and also saw blood, flags, and the hope of the Chilean people.

The people of Chile are suffering: but the suffering will surely end, and the people will surely be victorious. Neruda once shouted:

"You will never wear tattered clothes again,
You will never live a day without bread,
……………………and the eyes of women
Will no longer weep for their children." [Note 2]

Such a day will surely come.

### 访智利画家何塞·万徒勒里

专栏：

    访智利画家何塞·万徒勒里
    智利画家何塞·万徒勒里是应中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的邀请，来到中国的。在一个多月的时间里，他访问了上海、杭州、南京。他曾在燕子矶头惊叹长江的壮丽；也曾在上海和我们的艺术工作者们讨论过艺术怎样才能更好地为人民服务。五月初他回到首都，参加了阿维森纳、达·芬奇、雨果、果戈理的隆重的纪念大会。在欢乐的充满友情的五月之夜，记者们访问了这位中国人民的朋友和贵宾。
    一
    他刚从宴会上回来，立刻接待了我们。房间近窗的一头放着一只低矮的长方桌，四围放着一套沙发。桌上堆放着几部布匣线装的“先贤传”“敦煌壁画”，和一些介绍中国的书籍照片。他向我们介绍了他的夫人；大家就围着长方桌坐下来。万徒勒里夫人亲切地招呼着每一个人，让着烟。
    万徒勒里把桌上的书略略收拾，腾出了点地方，打开笔记本，燃起一枝纸烟，开始回答我们所提的问题。
    “拉丁美洲的艺术在目前是两种倾向的斗争，”他说，“一种是革命的现实主义的倾向；这是紧紧和拉丁美洲人民大众相结合的，为民族独立而斗争、为保卫和平而斗争的，反帝反封建的艺术。另一种则是腐朽的形式主义的倾向。”万徒勒里分两方面说明了智利的革命现实主义的艺术。首先，这是建筑于民族基础上的艺术。对形式主义的斗争在本质上也就是要求文化独立的斗争。在帝国主义侵入拉丁美洲的情况下，拉丁美洲的艺术也深深受了帝国主义的影响。美帝国主义耗费了数百万美金在各国建筑了所谓现代美术陈列馆之类，宣传形式主义的艺术，目的是想用颓废腐朽的艺术来压倒人民的艺术。因此为争取艺术独立而进行的斗争是必须建筑在人民和民族的基础之上的。拉丁美洲的艺术家们寻求着能表现自己人民的生活和斗争的民族形式。其次，革命的艺术从一开始就是和人民结合的；革命的民族艺术是工人阶级斗争的表现。在十九世纪，拉丁美洲的艺术也还是资产阶级小资产阶级的艺术。但当帝国主义势力侵入，和封建势力相结合以后，这种艺术也就随着资产阶级的衰落而被摧毁。二十世纪，工人阶级抬头，影响及于文化艺术方面；这就产生了反帝反殖民主义者的艺术。“我们革命艺术界的意向是要表现人民为争取民族独立而作的努力。不顾帝国主义的迫害，艺术家们还是和人民大众在一起，为民族独立自由而奋斗。这种艺术在人民中间起了很重要的作用。”
    这样的从人民中间产生出来的、为人民服务的艺术，必然受到人民的喜爱和爱护的。尽管由于经济条件的限制，南美洲至今还有许多人民遗留在文化圈外，但是艺术所接触到的人民却还是很广。相反的，形式主义者却是极端孤立的。他们的对象仅有一小撮反动派。这批堕落艺术家的集中地点是“现代美术陈列馆”——纽约的“画廊”“美术馆”一流东西的直接管辖的分支机构；而这后者则是美国老板们的私产。蝇集在“现代美术陈列馆”中的堕落分子就靠着美金的布施生活。这样的“现代美术陈列馆”是不可能得到什么成功的，因为他们所供养着的，只是一批接触不到人民，接触不到生活的形式主义者而已。
    美国老板曾经花了大量的金钱，想收买人民的艺术家，但是并没有成功。艺术家并未被收买，和人民过着同样艰苦的生活。由于如此，他们是有独立的创造和风格的，是能够表现人民的；也由于如此，他们能够表现真正的南美洲的文化。
    二
    话题转到万徒勒里在新中国的访问。
    在上海的时候，他曾经和我们的艺术工作者们交流了作画的经验，交流了两国艺术界的情况，并且在寻求更好地为人民服务的艺术形式的基础上讨论过一些问题。中智两国艺术界在根本问题上，在努力目标上，在总的方向和道路上，他说，都是完全一致的。“中国艺术工作者的创作经验，”他接着说，“对我们是非常有益的。我要带回智利去。对智利艺术界的活动必将有极大的帮助。”他说这一次他的接触是中智艺术界第一次直接的接触，将是更广泛接触和交流的开始。他说，他在短短的旅行中间看到了新中国艺术创作的高度政治水平；其中，他尤其推崇曾对南美起重大影响的新中国的版画。他谦逊地说，要向新中国学习。
    从北方，从南方，从城市，从乡村，画家万徒勒里得到了两个极深刻的印象：中国人民爱好和平；中国人民建设新中国的热情。无论是镟床上的工人，或是秧田里的农民，都向他指明了一件事情：他们正在和平幸福的土地上，努力建设着自己的祖国。他恳切地述说，中国人民保卫和平的行动，也就是保卫了智利的和平；中国人民反帝反封建的革命经验也帮助了智利人民的革命。因此，他说：“我们人民把中国看作反帝国主义保卫世界和平的很好的朋友……同时，看到了新中国，就如看到了我们的未来一样。”
    因此，当他看到了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪证的时候，他和我国人民一样地发出愤怒和痛恨的声音。
    “前几天我同法国、意大利友人们去看了美帝国主义细菌战罪行展览会。”万徒勒里向记者们说：“在展览会上，看到了很全面的一个证据。这些证据很明白地揭穿了灭绝人性的战犯们的罪恶面目。在智利，我们的人民是不敢相信美帝国主义竟有如此大的罪行的。因此，这样一个展览会就特别显得重要。但是，尽管美国侵略者竭力掩盖其罪恶行为，人民的抗议已愈来愈大。在这一件件的证据公开以后，这种抗议必将更大。为了孤立战犯，这些证据必须尽量让更多的人知道，同时也在美国自己人民之前展开。”
    他继续说：“这个展览会不仅提供了材料，而且说明了中朝人民对细菌战的斗争。中国人民对世界人民的贡献是巨大的，他们不仅挡住了细菌战，而且唤醒了世界人民。”
    万徒勒里在展览会上不仅看到了美帝国主义进行细菌战的铁证，也看到了美帝国主义准备细菌战的渊源。他看到：这批恶魔们在很早以前就作了准备；不仅在物质上、而且在思想上精神上作了准备。他看到美国侵略者们非法释放并勾结日本细菌战犯进行这一罪恶勾当的经过。他愤怒地说：“对于这一切，美国政府和细菌战犯必须负完全责任。他们应该被带到世界人民的面前来受裁判和惩罚。到那时，决不会有人像他们释放日本战犯那样地释放他们的。”
    三
    记者们渴望知道拉丁美洲人民保卫和平的情况，但是时间已经过了午夜。为了担心我们的客人过于劳累，我们商量着是不是把访问移到第二天再继续。但是，万徒勒里诚挚地说：“对于这样重要的问题，我是决不会感到劳累的。”谈话继续了下去。
    美帝国主义的毒爪紧紧控制了整个拉丁美洲；虽然每一个国家的具体情况不同，但对和平战士的压制则是同样的特别厉害。在大部分拉丁美洲国家中，和平运动甚至是不合法的。在其余的国家，虽然在表面上承认它的合法性，但是和平战士也同样地受到迫害。拥护和平的游行集会是被禁止的；报刊出版物上的拥护和平的舆论是被禁止的；甚至连征集和平签名的人也要遭到逮捕。但是，拉丁美洲的和平战士还是坚持了公开斗争的方式。他们不顾警察迫害，英勇地为争取保卫和平的合法权利而斗争。他们宁愿在街头为了和平而被捕，决不让和平运动由于迫害而转入地下。他们以自己的行动保卫了和平。很多和平战士曾因此被投入了牢狱，但是拉丁美洲的和平运动却一天比一天的更高涨起来。人们愈来愈明白，保卫和平的斗争和争取民主、独立的斗争，是休戚相关的。
    战争贩子的政策也就是使人民贫困饥饿，使和平民主遭到压抑的政策。整军备战替拉丁美洲带来了沉重负担。拉丁美洲人民看清了美帝国主义的目的是要把他们推下悲惨贫困的深渊，是要屠杀和平人民；因此和平运动日益高涨。战争贩子们推人民去进行战争冒险的阴谋并未得逞。
    万徒勒里举了一个例子。美帝国主义开始侵犯朝鲜时，企图动员拉丁美洲人民参加这一罪恶行动。他们把侵朝战争说成一次旅行、一个发财的机会，来骗取兵员。但是立刻在人民中间自发地爆发了一个浩大的反战运动，规模之大和普遍，远超过了所组织的范围。例如：阿根廷政府企图募兵送往朝鲜的时候，阿根廷的妇女自发地从各处走向首都，举行大示威，高呼着“我们反对送士兵往朝鲜！”这次示威成了阿根廷历史上最大的一次和平运动。
    在美帝国主义及其傀儡们的大力宣传之下，在人口达一亿五千万人的拉丁美洲，送兵往朝鲜的，却只有一个国家——最落后的哥伦比亚，人数——只有二千，而且都是些流氓和职业乞丐。当初原有四千人，万徒勒里笑着说，从京城开向港口的途中，有两千人带了步枪和装备开了小差。反动政府遭受了不小的损失，只得匆匆忙忙把剩下的两千人连夜偷偷装上了船，连原定举行的“堂皇”的仪式也不暇举行了。“在今天，”万徒勒里说，“甚至连这样的两千个也难于拉到的。”
    征集和平签名运动的一次比一次强大，使美帝国主义及其傀儡们心惊胆怕。他们尽一切力量企图压抑和平集会，窒息人民的和平呼声。今年初，拉丁美洲举行了一次全美洲的和平大会，拉丁美洲各国的和平战士都热烈地发起了筹备运动。美帝国主义及其傀儡们害怕这一和平大会的成功，用种种手段阻挠大会在预定的巴西、阿根廷或智利召开。但是，大会终于还是在乌拉圭首都举行了；虽然由于警察的迫害，不得不被迫半公开举行。“这显示了傀儡们的怯弱，和平力量的壮大。”万徒勒里说，“他们是真正的惧怕美洲人民聚集在一起讨论这大陆上的和平问题。”
    大会显示了美洲人民保卫和平的坚决意志。他们反对备战，反对原子弹及其他大规模屠杀人民的武器（包括细菌武器）；要求和平，要求民族独立，要求改变人民的悲惨命运。
    “今天，我们拉丁美洲人民，特别是太平洋沿岸国家的人民，都热烈期待着亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的举行。”万徒勒里说，“这是因为，我们拥护和平共处的原则，并且认识到，和平是不可分割的。我们理解到，美帝国主义的重新武装日本，拖延并阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战，已经严重地危害了世界和平。其次，我们拥护恢复和发展各国间的正常贸易关系并自由地交流文化。因此我们由衷地欢迎这一包括美洲西岸国家在内的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。美洲西岸各国人民已都成立了筹备委员会，热烈支持最近即将在北京举行的筹备会议。”
    “美帝国主义对亚洲的侵略，意味着对拉丁美洲的侵略。”万徒勒里最后说：“由于中国人民的英勇抵抗，战火现在已经受到了抑制。拉丁美洲人民坚决反对细菌战。当美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证更多地公开于他们之前的时候，抗议运动必将更为扩大和深化。所有这些罪证，对我们都是有益的助力。它帮助我们向人民揭露美帝国主义企图毁灭全人类的目的。所有这些都将愈益加强我们人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的决心。和平运动将更加强大起来，我们拉丁美洲人民决不让我们的资源作毁灭人类的罪恶用途。”
    四
    在参观、座谈、会晤、赴宴……紧张的一天之后。何塞·万徒勒里还这样不顾劳累地向我们作了近五小时的谈话，我深深为他的精神所感动。我回想起从刊物上看到的他的革命经历——
    他是一个优秀的共产党员，一个和平战士，一个人民的艺术家。他曾经当选为智利全国学生联合会主席（一九四三年），担任过“知识分子保卫文化同盟”秘书长（一九四五年），担任过智利共产党机关报“世纪”的编辑和智利共产党全国文化政策委员会书记处的书记，现在则是智利和平委员会的委员。去年十一月，代表智利和平战士出席了世界和平理事会维也纳会议。他从事木刻、铜刻、油画、宣传画的创作；曾为聂鲁达的许多诗篇绘制插图。
    由于我们的请求，万徒勒里给我们看他的创作，主要是版画。第一批是聂鲁达诗篇“广场上的死者”的插图；第二批是控诉沙漠集中营的作品〔注一〕；第三批是聂鲁达诗集“宇宙之歌”中插图的原稿。从这些图画里，我看到了矿工，渔妇，沙漠上坐以待毙的母亲和儿童，也看到了血泊、旗帜和智利人民的希望。
    智利的人民正受着苦难：但是苦难一定会结束，人民是一定要获得胜利的。聂鲁达曾经呼喊过：
    “你们再也不会穿褴褛的衣裳，
    你们再也不会过没有面包的日子，
    ……………………而妇女们的眼睛
    也将不再为她们的孩子哭泣。”〔注二〕
    这样的日子必将到来。
