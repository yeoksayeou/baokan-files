The Nankou Railway Factory After the "Three-Anti" Campaign
By our reporter Chen Ji

    Walking into the mechanical workshop of the Nankou Railway Factory, I saw a lathe among several others that was no longer in use. On this idle lathe hung a wooden sign with the eye-catching words: "Due to increased work efficiency, this lathe, which has been saved, is temporarily out of use and will be handed over to the state soon."

    Since the launch of the "Three-Anti" campaign, the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers at the Nankou Railway Factory has been further enhanced. They have tapped the potential of the machines, shortened working hours, and saved five lathes and fifteen lathe operators. Factory director Huang Yingfu told me that they would distribute the saved lathes and surplus lathe operators to other departments. In the past, one often heard people in the factory discussing: "There aren't enough machines and not enough people, how can we increase production?" In the past, there were similar arguments at the Nankou Railway Factory. Today, I heard the opposite: "It can't be said that there's a lack of machines now, and there are enough people. The only thing we're afraid of is not harnessing the power of the masses."

    In a discussion, I talked with the workers about the production plan. Since liberation, the Nankou Railway Factory had never completed its first-quarter production plan. For a long time, everyone generally believed that the reason for not completing the task was "the cold weather and the difficulty of outdoor production," and so on. This year, in the first quarter, they not only completed but also exceeded the production plan, and are confidently striving to complete the first half of the year's production plan one month ahead of schedule. Now, facing this fact, everyone admits that emphasizing objective difficulties in the past was wrong and that they had failed to see the power of the masses. Factory director Huang Yingfu said: "This year, we also have those objective difficulties of the past, and our tasks have increased more than in the past, but we can exceed the target. This is because we have tapped the enthusiasm of the masses." This year, the production plan was formulated through mass discussion. Every worker knows their task and understands that if their task is not completed, it will affect the entire factory's plan. Some workers in the mechanical workshop said:
    "If we don't make the parts on time, the comrades in the locomotive workshop will not be able to repair the locomotives because they don't have the parts." The staff of the materials department understood the supply plan and were worried every day that the materials would not be supplied in time, fearing that work would be stopped due to lack of materials. Everyone is so concerned about their production tasks that they take the initiative to find ways to complete them. Some cadres have not yet seen this major change and cannot adapt to the actual situation to revise the plan. Therefore, they deeply feel that the plan is lagging behind actual production.

    When the Nankou Railway Factory assessed working hours last year, it negated the old time quotas and established new quotas. At that time, people reflected: "The working hours are set so low, how can we complete the task?" Today, at the Nankou Railway Factory, I see examples of workers shortening working hours everywhere. Team leader Zhang Jianxin led the entire workers in his production team to lathe steam cylinder hooks, which took only six minutes, reducing the standard working hours of forty-five minutes by thirty-nine minutes, increasing efficiency by six and a half times. Wang Zhengming making wiring boxes used to take twenty-six hours before the "Three-Anti" campaign, but now it only takes eight hours. He believes that as long as he thinks of some more ways, he can still improve work efficiency. Recently, it took him only one minute to make the round hole of the distribution box, increasing production efficiency by twenty-nine times compared to the previous standard working hours of thirty minutes. Worker Deng Zhixiang used to spend more than ten minutes welding wire ends, but now he only needs one minute. The processing time for the parts of one locomotive used to be two hundred and sixteen work hours, but now it only takes one hundred and sixty-one work hours. These examples show that the original working hours are already outdated, and new quotas and new standards are constantly emerging. The view that "working hours are set too low, how can we complete the task" has been shattered.

    Where did these new changes in the Nankou Railway Factory come from? The practical actions of the workers answered this question. In the "Three-Anti" campaign, they raised their class consciousness, recognized the unity of national and individual interests, and saw the bright and beautiful future of the motherland. They all began to consciously work to strive for this future. This kind of labor is joyful and glorious. Worker Zhang Wen used to think, "Isn't working just for food?", "Why work so hard?" He was a lathe operator, and he never thought of ways to improve efficiency when standing next to the lathe. "Anyway, just follow the old rules and get paid." No matter what kind of work he was doing, he always "held back a little." He felt: "If I lathe too fast, the working hour standard will be changed, and what if I can't keep up with the standard in the future?" In the "Three-Anti" campaign, his workmates criticized him as "five-foot eyes"—unable to see far. Kan Shimin asked him: "Are you a member of the working class?" "Of course!" Kan Shimin said: "The eyes of the working class are not 'five-foot eyes'. How can you be a member of the working class if you are always calculating personal interests? To be honest, if the working class were all like you, how could the country's industrialization be accelerated?" These criticisms stung Zhang Wen's heart. He thought: "Everyone is right, I've been too sorry for the country in the past. During the Kuomintang period, we workers couldn't get enough to eat or wear. Today, I eat fine grains and wear new clothes. Where did these personal benefits come from? Didn't the Communist Party bring them? If I don't work hard and don't build the country well, I won't be well either." Thinking of this, he was no longer satisfied with the past work efficiency. "Can that 'old ox-broken cart' look continue? No!" When he was lathing the steam chamber hook, he thought of everyone's criticism and how to speed up. He turned the lathe a little faster and halved the working hours for lathing the steam chamber hook. But he felt that this was not a new record, and he wanted to study multi-tool multi-blade methods to create new records. Propagandist Zhang Mingyuan told me: After the "Three-Anti" campaign, backward elements began to transform, middle-of-the-road elements became active, and active elements became even more active. The copper melting department of the foundry used to be an inactive "dead corner". They only did the prescribed amount of copper melting and were unwilling to melt a little more copper. In the "Three-Anti" campaign, they changed this practice. A copper melting worker told me: It is not enough to only guarantee the needs of the copper using departments, we should melt more copper to stimulate the production enthusiasm of the copper using departments. For this reason, they held a meeting to study how to melt more copper. In the past, when they went to work, they had to have one person temporarily light the stove, and the rest of the people were idle. They thought this was not right, so they decided to have one person come two hours earlier to preheat the stove so that everyone would not be idle when they went to work. In this way, they were able to melt three more pots of copper in a day. When the workers in the copper using departments heard this, they all shouted: "Look! They are all active, can we still lag behind?" In the past, some active elements worked hard every day, racking their brains to find ways to save money. However, they did not expect that their labor results would be stolen by embezzlers. They angrily participated in the "Three-Anti" struggle and caught the embezzlers. They said happily: "Now, every piece we create can be used for the construction of the motherland. Thinking of this, we work harder." Active element Deng Zhixiang and his workmates discussed and adopted the Kovalev method to concentrate the advantages of each person's wire welding actions. In this way, they not only saved materials but also increased efficiency by nine times. They believe: "In the future, we must not only use our brains but also use our eyes." Use your brain to find tricks and use your eyes to guard against the loss of state property.

    At a production competition challenge meeting, I heard the workers shout: "Welcome technicians to work with us!" I also heard the technicians respond to the workers' request: "We want to learn from the workers." For a long time in the past, the technicians at the Nankou Railway Factory were unwilling to go to the scene and looked down on the production experience of the workers. They only believed in the knowledge in books. Technician Wang Yu used to dislike the workers as "dirty" and always felt that: the workers don't understand any theory, what's the use of us combining with them? But every time he encountered practical technical difficulties, the workers could help him solve them. In the "Tiger Hunting Team," Wang Yu didn't know how to find the "tigers." The workers told him the clues, but he still didn't believe them. However, the result proved that the corrupt officials were indeed those pointed out by the workers. These facts educated Wang Yu. Wang Yu blamed himself: "The workers are working so hard and are so concerned about the future of the motherland, but I still look down on them and think I have knowledge. In fact, if we don't combine with the workers, we will accomplish nothing." He gave an example: Technician Lü Zhishu knew the theory of high-speed cutting from books, but didn't know how to apply it. When he studied the characteristics of the lathe with the workers and the specific methods of applying high-speed cutting, he realized that: "Theory" alone cannot solve the problem. He said: "Only when I learn the practical experience of applying high-speed cutting from the workers can I correctly guide the workers on how to apply high-speed cutting." Under the guidance of Lü Zhishu, the workers applied high-speed cutting and improved efficiency. The workers in the mechanical workshop used to say: "When technicians encounter technical problems that we ask, they always talk a lot of 'theory', but they never solve our practical problems." Now they say: "We are willing to listen to what the technicians say!" Recently, the technicians organized a high-speed cutting research association, and the workers have asked to participate. This phenomenon was rare in the past. In the Nankou Railway Factory after the "Three-Anti" campaign, technicians and workers have begun to combine.

    In the Nankou Railway Factory, I feel that our factory has undergone new changes in all aspects after the "Three-Anti" campaign. This change has created important conditions for us to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement on a large scale. We can expect that after the launch of the full load, super-axle, and five-hundred-kilometer movement on the national railway, the Nankou Railway Factory will achieve new victories.

    “三反”运动后的南口铁路工厂
    本报记者  陈迹
    走进南口铁路工厂机械所，我看到在几台车床中间，有一台车床停止使用了。这台停止使用的车床上，挂着一个木牌，上面写着耀眼的字样：“由于提高了工作效率，这台被省出来的车床暂时停用，不日将上缴。”
    自从“三反”运动开展以来，南口铁路工厂工人们的爱国热情更加提高了，他们发挥了机器的潜在能力，缩短了工作时间，省出了五台车床，十五名镟工。厂长黄英夫告诉我，他们要把省出来的车床，多余的镟工，分送到别的部门去。过去在工厂里，常常听见人们议论：“机器不够，人也不多，怎样提高生产呀？”过去南口铁路工厂里也有这样的论调。今天我却听到了相反的话：“机器目前不能算缺，人也不少，就怕群众力量没有发挥。”
    在一个座谈会里，我和工人群众谈论生产计划问题。解放以来，南口铁路工厂从来没有完成过第一季度生产计划。长时间内大家总认为任务不能完成的原因是“气候寒冷，露天生产困难”等等。今年第一季度，他们不仅完成而且超额完成了生产计划，并且满怀信心地争取提前一个月完成上半年的生产计划。现在大家面对这样的事实，承认过去强调客观困难是不对的，是没有看见群众的力量。厂长黄英夫说：“今年我们也有以往的那些客观困难，而且我们的任务比以往增多了，但我们却能超额完成任务。这是因为我们发挥了群众的积极性。”今年，生产计划是通过群众的讨论而订出来的。每个工人都知道自己的任务，都了解自己的任务完不成，就要影响全厂的计划。机械所的一些工人说：
    “我们不按期做出配件，机车所的同志就要因为没有配件而不能修理机车。”材料室的职工了解了供应计划，每天都担心材料供应不上，生怕停工待料。人人这样关心着自己的生产任务，就主动地设法完成。有些干部还没有看见这个重大的转变，还不能适应实际情况，来修改计划。因此他们深深地感到：计划落在实际生产的后面了。
    去年南口铁路工厂查定工时的时候，否定了旧的工时定额，确定了新的定额。当时人们反映：“工时定得这样低，怎能完成任务？”今天，我在南口铁路工厂，到处看见工人们缩短工时的事例。组长张建新带领生产小组的全体工人，镟汽缸勾贝，只要六分钟，比定额工时四十五分钟减少了三十九分钟，效率提高了六倍半。王正明做配线盒子，在“三反”运动以前需要二十六小时，现在只要八小时。他认为只要再想一些办法，还可以提高工作效率。最近他做分线盒的圆眼，只花了一分钟，比以前定额工时三十分钟的生产效率，提高了二十九倍。工人邓致祥焊线头，过去需要十多分钟，现在只需要一分钟。一台机车的配件的加工工时过去是二百十六个工，现在只需要一百六十一个工。这些事例说明原来的工时定额已经落后，新的定额、新的标准，正在不停地涌现出来。“工时定得低，怎能完成任务”的看法被粉碎了。
    南口铁路工厂这些新的变化是从那里来的呢？工人群众的实际行动答复了这个问题。他们在“三反”运动中，提高了阶级觉悟，认识了国家利益和个人利益的一致，看到了祖国的光辉美丽的前途，他们都开始自觉地为争取这个前途而劳动。这种劳动是愉快的，是光荣的。工人张文，过去总以为“干活还不是为了吃饭”，“何必那样卖劲呢？”他是个镟工，他过去站在镟床旁边，从来不想办法去提高效率，“反正照老规矩办事，拿到工资就行了”。他不论镟那种活，都要“留一手”。他觉得：“镟快了，工时的标准又要改了，将来赶不上标准，怎么办？”在“三反”运动中，工友们批评他是“五尺眼”——看不远。阚世民问他：“你是不是工人阶级的一分子？”“当然是呀！”阚世民说：“工人阶级的眼睛不是‘五尺眼’。你天天盘算个人利益，怎能是工人阶级呢？老实说，工人阶级都像你那样，国家的工业化怎能加快呢？”这些批评刺痛了张文的心。他想：“大家说得对，我过去太对不起国家。在国民党时期，我们工人吃不饱穿不暖；今天我吃细粮穿新衣。这些个人利益从那里来的呢？还不是共产党带来的吗？我不好好干，不把国家建设好，我个人也不会好。”想到这里，他不满足过去的工作效率了。“那种‘老牛破车’的样儿还能继续下去吗？不能！”当他镟汽室勾贝时，就想到大家的批评，想到怎样加快速度，他把车子开快了一些，就把镟汽室勾贝的工时缩短了一半。但他觉得这还不是新纪录，他还要钻研多刀多刃的方法，来创造新纪录。宣传员张名远告诉我：经过
    “三反”运动，落后分子开始转变，中间分子开始积极，积极分子更积极了。铸工所的化铜部门过去是不活跃的“死角”，他们只做到规定的化铜的数量，不愿多化一点铜。在“三反”运动中，他们改变了这种做法。有个化铜工人对我说：只保证用铜的部门的需要还是不够的，还应该多化一些铜，刺激用铜的部门的生产情绪。为此他们开了一个会，研究怎样多化一些铜。过去他们上了班，都先得由一个人临时燃火炉，其余的人闲着没事干；他们认为这样是不行的，于是决定先让一个人早来两小时，预先把火炉燃好，免得大家上了班没有事干。这样
    一来，果然能在一天内，多化了三罐铜。用铜的部门的工人们听了，都嚷道：“瞧！他们都积极起来了，我们还能落后吗？”过去一些积极分子天天辛苦地劳动，费尽心血地找节约的窍门；然而他们没有想到他们的劳动成果被贪污分子偷去了。他们愤怒地参加了“三反”斗争，捉住了贪污分子。他们很高兴地说：“这一下，我们创造的每一件东西，都能用到祖国建设上去了。想起这一点，我们干得就起劲。”积极分子邓致祥和工友们商议，采用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，把各人焊线头的动作的优点集中起来。这样，不但省了材料，而且把效率提高了九倍。他们认为：“今后不但要动脑筋，还要动眼睛。”动脑筋找窍门，动眼睛防备国家财物的损失。
    在一次生产竞赛的挑战大会上，我听见工人们喊：“欢迎技术人员和我们在一起工作！”我又听见技术人员答复工人的要求：“我们要向工人们学习。”在过去很长时期内，南口铁路工厂的技术人员，不愿意下现场，看不起工人群众的生产经验，只相信书本上的知识。技术人员王玉，过去嫌工人
    “肮脏”，总觉得：工人不懂得啥理论，我们跟他们结合又有什么用呢？但在他每次碰到技术上的实际困难的时候，工人都能帮他解决。在“打虎队”里，王玉不知道怎样发现“老虎”；工人们告诉他了线索，他还不相信。但是，结果证明贪污犯果然正是工人们指出的那些人。这些事实教育了王玉。王玉责备自己：“工人那样地紧张劳动，那样地关心祖国的前途，而我还看不起他们，自以为自己有知识。实际上，我们如果不和工人结合，就会一事无成。”他举了一个例子：技术人员吕志书从书本上知道了高速切削法的理论，但不知道怎样运用。当他和工人在一起研究车床的性格，运用高速切削法的具体方法时，他才明白了：只凭那点“理论”是不能解决问题的。他说：“只有在我从工人那里知道了运用高速切削法的实际经验时，我才能正确地指导工人怎样运用高速切削法。”工人们在吕志书的指导下，运用高速切削法，提高了效率。机械所的工人过去常常说：“技术人员碰到我们问的技术上的问题，总是谈一大堆‘理论’，可是总没有解决我们的实际问题。”现在他们说：“技术人员谈的，我们愿意听啦！”最近，技术人员组织了高速切削法研究会，工人都纷纷要求参加。这种现象在过去是少见的。在“三反”运动后的南口铁路工厂，技术人员和工人已经开始结合了。
    在南口铁路工厂，我感到我们的工厂在“三反”运动之后各方面都有了新的变化，这种变化已为我们大规模地开展增产节约运动创造了重要的条件。我们可以预计：在全国铁路开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动之后，南口铁路工厂一定会取得新的胜利。
