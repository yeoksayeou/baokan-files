The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" issue 141, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial commemorating the 82nd anniversary of Lenin's birth, entitled "Leninism is the Great Ideological Weapon of the Communist and Workers' Parties." The editorial states: Lenin's great contribution lies not only in his defense of Marxism against the distortion of reformist Second International leaders and all kinds of opportunists, but also in his creative development of Marxism based on the new historical conditions of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. Comrade Stalin's works are an invaluable contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Stalin brilliantly developed Leninism, making Leninism's radiant ideals increasingly the property of the broad masses of people in all countries, and having an increasingly great impact on the entire course of world history. Lenin and Stalin elevated the significance of revolutionary theory to an unprecedented level of importance, and they taught the Communists of all countries to be good at fully utilizing the mobilizing, organizing, and transforming power of revolutionary theory. Once the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are grasped by the masses, they become a great material force; the vanguard of the proletariat—the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries—plays a decisive role in disseminating Marxist-Leninist thought, in transforming Marxist-Leninist thought into the practice of the international communist movement, and in the struggle for the victory of socialism and the construction of socialist society. The editorial then described how the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe, China, the German Democratic Republic, and the capitalist and colonial countries are arming themselves with the invincible Marxist theory and constantly achieving victories in the struggle inside and outside the Party. The editorial also stated: The Communist and Workers' Parties are guided in their daily activities by Lenin and Stalin's doctrine that the Party must maintain a lively and close connection with the masses of the people. Experience shows that wherever Party members do not become detached from the non-Party people, do not limit themselves to the Party's small circle, wherever the Party humbly listens to the opinions of the masses of the people, closely pays attention to their revolutionary nature, studies the tactics of the masses' struggles, and in this way examines whether the Party's policies are correct, thereby not only educating the masses but also learning from the masses, the Party's policies will inevitably be victorious, the Party will gain the support of the vast majority of the people, and the Party's influence will expand day by day. The editorial finally emphasized: Our era has repeatedly clearly demonstrated the irrefutable correctness of Leninism, predicting that the immortal Leninist ideas will be victorious throughout the world.

This issue contains important articles such as: excerpts from the political report of Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, at the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain on April 11th of this year: "Struggle for Peace and for the National Independence of Great Britain"; a book review by Jozwiak, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, on Bolesław Bierut's "On the Party": "Striving for the Victory of Marxist-Leninist Thought, Socialism and Peace"; "On the Election of Party Organs of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany" by Schoen, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany; "Work Experience of the Italian Communist Party Cell Leaders" by Ghini, member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, etc.

Jozwiak's article said: Comrade Bierut's book "On the Party" describes the path taken by the Polish United Workers' Party in adhering to the Party's Marxist-Leninist line and striving for the Bolshevikization of the Party. For Party members, this book is a real pointer in the daily struggle to complete the great tasks currently facing every Party organization and every Party member. The book "On the Party" came into being because Comrade Bierut was able to creatively apply Marxism-Leninism to the Polish situation. Jozwiak's article then analyzed in detail how Bierut, as reflected in the book "On the Party," overcame the destructive activities of the Gomulka group and consolidated the foundation of Poland's socialist construction.

Schön's article said: The Second Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will be held in July. The Party's various branches are holding congresses to hear reports on the work of the Party committees, discuss measures to improve Party work, and elect new Party committees. After that, the Party organizations in large enterprises, cities, districts, and states will hold representative meetings, which will critically discuss the political, ideological, and organizational work in their respective organizations, elect new Party organs, and elect representatives to attend the upcoming Party congress. The holding of these conferences will be a major event in the life of the Party. At these conferences, some of the best activists in our industry will exchange their experiences and put forward suggestions for improving work. Schön also pointed out: An unremitting struggle against bureaucracy is one of the main tasks in preparing for the Second Party Congress. In order to solve political, economic and cultural tasks, the leading organs of the Party must adopt new working methods. It is very important to nominate candidates from among the more capable, more conscious and more active Party members when electing new Party committees.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四一期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一四一期已经出版。
    本期发表纪念列宁诞生八十二周年的社论，题为“列宁主义是共产党和工人党的伟大思想武器”。社论说：列宁的伟大贡献不仅在于他捍卫了马克思主义，反对改良主义的第二国际领袖和形形色色的机会主义者的歪曲，而且在于他依据帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的新的历史条件创造性地发展了马克思主义。斯大林同志的著作是马克思列宁主义宝库中的不可估量的贡献。斯大林同志光辉地发展了列宁主义，使列宁主义的光芒万丈的理想一天天变成越来越广大的各国人民群众的财产，对于世界历史的整个进程发生越来越大的影响。列宁和斯大林把革命理论的意义提高到空前未有的重要地位，他们教导各国共产党人要善于充分利用革命理论的动员、组织与改造的力量。马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论一旦掌握了群众，就成为伟大的物质力量；无产阶级的先锋队——各国共产党和工人党，在传播马克思列宁主义思想，在把马克思列宁主义思想变成为国际共产主义运动的实践的斗争，在争取社会主义的胜利和建设社会主义社会的工作中，起着决定性的作用。社论接着叙述了苏联、东欧人民民主国家、中国、德意志民主共和国、资本主义国家和殖民地国家共产党和工人党以无敌的马克思主义理论武装自己，在党内外的斗争中不断取得胜利的情况。社论又说：共产党和工人党是以列宁和斯大林关于党必须与人民群众保持生动与密切的联系这个学说作为他们日常活动的指导的。经验表明：凡是在党员不脱离非党人民，不把自己局限在党的小圈子内的地方，凡是在党虚心听取人民群众的意见、密切地注意他们的革命性、研究群众斗争的策略，以这种方法来检查党的政策是否正确，从而不仅教育群众而且向群众学习的地方，党的政策就必能取得胜利，党就能得到极大多数人民的拥护，党的影响也就一天一天地扩大。社论最后着重指出：我们的时代一再清楚地证明了列宁主义的不可辩驳的正确性，预示不朽的列宁主义思想将在全世界得到胜利。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：英国共产党总书记波立特在今年四月十一日英国共产党第二十二届代表大会上政治报告的摘录：“争取和平与争取英国的民族独立”；波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员约兹维亚克评贝鲁特所作“论党”的书评：“为马克思列宁主义思想、社会主义与和平的胜利而斗争”；德国统一社会党中央委员会书记处书记舒恩的“关于德国统一社会党党机构的选举问题”；意大利共产党中央委员会委员吉尼的“意大利共产党党小组长的工作经验”等。
    约兹维亚克的文章说：贝鲁特同志的“论党”一书，描写了波兰统一工人党在坚持党的马克思列宁主义路线、争取党的布尔什维克化的斗争中所走过的道路。对党员来说，在完成目前每一个党的组织与每一个党员所面临的伟大任务的日常斗争中，这本书是一个真正的指针。“论党”这本书所以产生，是因为贝鲁特同志能把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用到波兰的情况中去。约兹维亚克的文章接着详细分析了从“论党”一书中反映出来的贝鲁特如何克服哥穆尔卡集团的破坏活动并巩固了波兰社会主义建设的基础的情形。
    舒恩的文章说：德国统一社会党的第二次代表会议将在七月举行。党的各个支部正在举行大会以听取党委员会的工作报告，讨论改进党工作的措施，并选举新的党委员会。之后，大企业中及城、区、州中的党组织就将举行代表会议，这些会议将批判地讨论各该组织中的政治工作、思想工作和组织工作，选举新的党机构，并选出代表以便参加将要举行的党代表会议。这些大会的举行将是党生活中的重大事件。在这些大会上，我们工业中一些最优秀的活动分子，将交换他们的经验，提出改进工作的建议。舒恩并指出：对官僚主义作无情的斗争，是筹备第二次党代表会议主要工作之一。为了解决政治、经济和文化任务，党的领导机构必须采取新的工作方法。在选举新的党委员会时，从能力较强、觉悟较高及比较积极的党员中提名候选人，是十分重要的。
