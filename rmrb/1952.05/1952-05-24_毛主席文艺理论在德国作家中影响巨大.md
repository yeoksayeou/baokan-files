Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch: This agency's Berlin correspondent recently received a letter from the renowned German playwright Professor Friedrich Wolf, in which Professor Wolf praised the great significance of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

Professor Wolf is a recipient of the German Democratic Republic's National Prize and the author of plays such as "Professor Mamlock" and "The Trojan Horse." His letter stated: "‘Mao Zedong's Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art’ (German translation of the Beijing edition) has been received, thank you. This is an excellent book; now we have finally read the full text of this book expounding Mao Zedong's basic literary and art theories, which is of the greatest use to us German writers. We have known and valued this book for a long time, but unfortunately, only excerpts have been available until now. However, even in those excerpts, our writers have already learned a great deal from this new and creative Marxist aesthetics, namely from Mao Zedong's clear definition of the relationship between artists and the masses of the people. To illustrate the great influence of Mao Zedong's literary and art theories on German writers, I will cite only one example: In 1949, on the inside front cover of the inaugural issue of the monthly 'People and Art,' which I edited – the organ of the 'German People's Theater Association' with 500,000 members – the proposition from 'Mao Zedong's Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' was quoted as the motto, that is, the purpose, of founding this magazine: This is ‘All revolutionary writers and artists... can only educate the masses by representing them, and can only be teachers of the masses by being their students.’"

    毛主席文艺理论在德国作家中影响巨大
    【新华社柏林航讯】本社驻柏林记者最近接到德国名戏剧家费里特利希·沃尔夫教授来信，沃尔夫教授在信中推崇毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”一书的伟大意义。
    沃尔夫教授是德意志民主共和国国家奖金得奖人，“马门教授”、“新木马计”等剧本作者。他的来信说：“‘毛泽东在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’（北京版德文译本）已经收到，谢谢。这是一本极好的书；现在我们终于读到了这本阐述毛泽东基本文艺理论的书籍的全文，这对于我们德国的作家们有着最大的用处。好久以来我们就已知道和重视这本书了，可惜的是直到现在还只有节译本。但即使在那节译本中，我们的作家们也早已从这个新的、创造性马克思主义美学中，即从毛泽东对艺术家与人民群众的相互关系的明晰定义中，学到了许多东西。为了说明毛泽东的文艺理论在德国作家中的巨大影响，我只举下面一个例子：一九四九年在我所主编的‘人民与艺术’月刊——这是拥有五十万会员的‘德国人民戏剧协会’的机关刊——的创刊号上，在里封面就引录了‘毛泽东在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话’中的命题，作为创办这一杂志的箴言也就是宗旨：这就是‘一切革命的文学家艺术家……只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。’”
