Xinhua News Agency, 29th: According to TASS, Brussels, 27th: Madame Vaillant-Couturier, a Belgian lawyer who participated in the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, gave a report at a press conference on the investigation conducted by the team in Korea and China.

Madame Vaillant-Couturier said: Based on the testimony of many witnesses and thorough investigation, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team is indeed of the opinion that the United States has committed crimes against humanity in Korea and China – bombing, torture, and the use of chemical weapons, bacteriological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

Madame Vaillant-Couturier said: We discovered that American planes bombed children in schools and bombed churches during combat. The Americans tortured people with inhumane methods: branding Korean people with red-hot irons, driving nails into their heads, pulling out their hair, etc. Many families were buried alive. This can be proved by the following fact: the corpses of the victims dug out from the ground all had their mouths open, filled with dirt. Among these buried people were also babies.

Madame Vaillant-Couturier said: The fact that the Americans used asphyxiating gas in Korea is also conclusive.

She continued: We conducted a very detailed investigation into the use of bacteriological weapons. From the many testimonies collected by the investigation team from eyewitnesses, this crime can be clearly seen: insects that were rarely seen or never seen before were found in many places in Korea and Northeast China. These insects were often discovered after American planes bombed the area. In addition, bacteriologists who spoke with members of the investigation team clearly stated that these insects were carrying germs. At the press conference, reporters saw photos of these insects and the shells of the bombs used to drop them.

In answering questions from reporters, Madame Vaillant-Couturier pointed out that the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team had proved that the army of Syngman Rhee also participated in the American crimes of slaughtering peaceful Korean residents.

Madame Vaillant-Couturier finally emphasized that despite the severe suffering, the Korean people showed great courage and unwavering confidence in defeating the aggressors.

Xinhua News Agency, 29th: TASS, Moscow, 28th: The Secretariat of the International Union of Students has sent a telegram to the Austrian Minister of Education protesting the measures taken to persecute Professor Brandweiner. The telegram stated: "Students around the world are deeply angered by the dismissal of Professor Brandweiner of the University of Graz. As the head of the investigation team organized by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to expose the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, his activities are a great contribution to the cause of world peace. On behalf of five million students around the world, we firmly protest against the unjust measures taken against Professor Brandweiner."

The Secretariat of the International Union of Students also sent a telegram to Professor Brandweiner, expressing solidarity with him and announcing that students around the world unanimously support Professor Brandweiner's courageous activities for peace.

　　莫伦斯夫人在布鲁塞尔记者招待会上
    报告美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行
    国际学联书记处抗议奥地利政府迫害布兰德魏纳
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔二十七日讯：参加国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的比利时律师莫伦斯夫人，在记者招待会上就该调查团在朝鲜和中国进行调查的经过作了一次报告。
    莫伦斯夫人说：根据许多证人的证言和周密的调查，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团确实认为：美国在朝鲜和中国犯了违背人道的罪行——轰炸、酷刑拷打和使用化学武器、细菌武器及其他大规模破坏武器。
    莫伦斯夫人说：我们发现，美国的飞机在作战中曾轰炸学校里的儿童、轰炸教堂。美国人以灭绝人性的方法来拷打人民：用烧红的烙铁来烙朝鲜的人民，把钉子钉入他们的头颅，拔掉他们的头发等等。许多家庭全家都被活埋。这可由下面的事实证明：从地下挖出来的被害人的尸体，都是张着嘴的，嘴里塞满了土。这些被活埋的人民里面还有婴儿。
    莫伦斯夫人说：美国人在朝鲜使用窒息性的毒气也是证据确凿的事实。
    她继续说：我们对细菌武器的使用情况作了非常详细的调查。由调查团从目睹者那里所搜集到的许多证言中，都可以很显然地看出这种罪行：在朝鲜和中国东北的许多地方都发现了以前不大见到的或完全没有见过的昆虫。而这种昆虫经常是在美机轰炸之后发现的。此外，和调查团团员们谈过话的细菌学家们都明确地说：这些昆虫都是带有病菌的。在记者招待会上，记者们看到了这种昆虫和投掷这种昆虫所用的炸弹的弹壳的照片。
    莫伦斯夫人在答复记者们提出的问题时指出：国际民主法律工作者协会调查团已经证明：李承晚的军队也参加了美国进行的屠杀朝鲜和平居民的罪行。
    莫伦斯夫人最后强调说，尽管遭遇着严重的苦难，朝鲜人民对于战胜侵略者却表现出极大的勇气和坚定的信心。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十八日讯：国际学生联合会书记处已致电奥地利教育部长，抗议迫害布兰德魏纳教授的措施。该电说：“全世界学生对于格拉茨大学教授布兰德魏纳被解聘一事，深为忿怒。作为国际民主法律工作者协会为揭露在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战的事实而组织的调查团的团长，他的活动对于世界和平事业是一个巨大的贡献。我们代表世界各地的五百万学生，坚决抗议对布兰德魏纳教授所采取的不公正措施。”
    国际学生联合会书记处同时致电布兰德魏纳教授，向他表示声援，并宣布：全世界学生一致支持布兰德魏纳教授为了和平而进行的勇敢活动。
