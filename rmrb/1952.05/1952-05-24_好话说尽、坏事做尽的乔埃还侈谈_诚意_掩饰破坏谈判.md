Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 22nd. Our correspondent reports: Chiao, the chief representative of the US side, who has exhausted all good words and done all bad deeds, today in the Panmunjom conference tent, for the last time lavishly talked about the "sincerity" shown by the US side in the Korean armistice negotiations over the past ten months. However, the US side's record of repeatedly violating agreements and creating provocative incidents to delay and sabotage the negotiations over the past ten months is the manifestation of the US side's "sincerity."

On July 21, 1951, US military aircraft violated the agreement and attacked our delegation's convoy.

On August 7, US military aircraft violated the agreement and strafed our delegation's vehicles. On August 19, US armed personnel violated the agreement and invaded the Kaesong neutral zone, killing Yao Qingxiang, the platoon leader of our military police.

On August 22, US military aircraft violated the agreement and suddenly attacked the Kaesong neutral zone, bombing and strafing our delegation's residence.

On September 1, US military aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone, dropping two bombs near the residence of the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese delegation.

On September 10, US military aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the airspace near the Kaesong meeting site, conducting strafing.

On October 12, US military aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone, conducting strafing and killing a child, Jiang Yongdun.

On December 11, US military aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone, bombing and strafing Lilingli Shejidung.

On January 17, 1952, US military aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the airspace over the Kaesong neutral zone, bombing Lilingli Shejidung.

On January 18, US military aircraft violated the agreement and strafed our delegation's convoy.

On April 5, US military aircraft violated the agreement and strafed our delegation's convoy, injuring nine people.

On May 12, US military aircraft violated the agreement and attacked our delegation's supply vehicles, and staff member Li Dongzhu was killed by a bullet.

On May 14, US military aircraft violated the agreement and invaded the Kaesong neutral zone, hovering at low altitude, dropping flares and strafing for as long as 55 minutes.

These incidents are only the most prominent ones. Other violations of the agreement, such as US military aircraft flying over the Kaesong neutral zone and the Panmunjom meeting area, and bombing and strafing our prisoner-of-war camps, have not been listed. Chiao's attempt to use the nice-sounding word "sincerity" to whitewash the fact that the US side has no sincerity will forever be futile.

    好话说尽、坏事做尽的乔埃还侈谈“诚意”掩饰破坏谈判
    【新华社开城二十二日电】本社记者报道：好话说尽，坏事做尽的美方首席代表乔埃，今天在板门店会议帐篷内最后一次侈谈美方在十个多月来朝鲜停战谈判中所表现的“诚意”。但十个多月来，美方多次违反协议，制造挑衅事件以拖延及破坏谈判的纪录就是美方“诚意”的表现。
    一九五一年七月二十一日，美方军用飞机，违反协议攻击我方代表团车队。
    八月七日，美方军用飞机，违反协议扫射我方代表团车辆。八月十九日，美方武装人员违反协议侵入开城中立区，杀害我方军事警察姚庆祥排长。
    八月二十二日，美方军用飞机，违反协议突然袭击开城中立区，轰炸、扫射我方代表团驻所。
    九月一日，美方军用飞机，违反协议侵入开城中立区上空朝中代表团首席代表驻所附近投弹两枚。
    九月十日，美方军用飞机，违反协议侵入开城会址区附近上空，进行扫射。
    十月十二日，美方军用飞机，违反协议侵入开城中立区上空，进行扫射，杀死儿童姜永敦。
    十二月十一日，美方军用飞机，违反协议侵入开城中立区上空，在丽陵里投弹、扫射。
    一九五二年一月十七日，美方军用飞机，违反协议侵入开城中立区上空，轰炸丽陵里社稷洞。
    一月十八日，美方军用飞机，违反协议扫射我方代表团车队。
    四月五日，美方军用飞机，违反协议扫射我方代表团车队，伤九人。
    五月十二日，美方军用飞机，违反协议袭击我方代表团供应车辆，工作人员李东洙中弹牺牲。
    五月十四日，美方军用飞机，违反协议侵入开城中立区，低空盘旋，投掷照明弹及扫射达五十五分钟之久。
    这些事件，还只是荦荦大者。其它如美方军用飞机飞越开城中立区及板门店会场区及轰炸扫射我方俘虏营等违反协议事件，尚未列入。乔埃企图用“诚意”这个好听的字眼来粉饰美方毫无诚意的事实，将永远是徒劳的。
