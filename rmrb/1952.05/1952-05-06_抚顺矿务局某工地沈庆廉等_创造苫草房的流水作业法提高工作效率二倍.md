    Shen Qinglian and Others from a Construction Site of Fushun Mining Bureau
    Create Assembly Line Method for Thatching Houses, Increasing Work Efficiency Twofold
    Editor: Shen Qinglian and Zhou Yuxue studied in the Construction Class of Northeast Workers' Political University. After completing their studies, they were assigned to work on-site at a construction site under the Basic Construction Company of Fushun Mining Bureau. They always remembered Comrade Gao Gang's instructions at the graduation ceremony, that they should take the lead in their work. Recently, they were leading workers in thatching houses, and because the division of labor was inappropriate, workers both on the roof and below had to wait idly, wasting time. After discovering this problem, they discussed it with the foreman and collectively created an assembly line method for thatching houses using scientific division of labor and construction procedures. This method is: one person carries water, one person mixes mud, two people send mud to the roof, one person carries grass curtains and wooden strips, one person nails the battens, two people lay the grass, and one person applies the mud. After nine workers implemented this method, they completed the thatching work in two hours, increasing the quota by two hundred percent. At the same time, they also established a mutual inspection system to check whether the mud is evenly applied, whether the battens are firmly nailed, and whether the grass is laid neatly. This significantly improved the quality compared to before, ensuring that the thatched house does not leak in the rain or blow away in the wind. This achievement has inspired the high working enthusiasm of all employees. Staff members sorted out materials on-site and assisted workers in carrying materials during their spare time; the foreman also personally helped.

    抚顺矿务局某工地沈庆廉等
    创造苫草房的流水作业法提高工作效率二倍
    编辑同志：沈庆廉、周余学两人曾在东北工人政治大学建筑班学习。他们学习完毕后，就被派往抚顺矿务局基本建设公司所属某工地现场工作。他们时刻记着高岗同志在结业大会上的指示，要在工作中起带头作用。最近，他们领导工人苫草房，因为分工不恰当，房上和房下工人都要空等，浪费了时间。他们发现了这个问题后，就和监工员研究，用科学的分工办法和施工程序，集体创造了苫草房的流水作业法。这个方法是：一人挑水，一人合泥，二人往房上送泥，一人搬运草帘和木条，一人钉压条，二人铺草，一人抹泥。九个工人施行此法后，在两小时内完成了苫草工作，比定额提高百分之二百。同时，他们还建立了互相检查制，检查泥是否抹匀，压条是否钉牢，铺草是否整齐？这样就使质量比以前显著提高，保证了草房雨淋不漏、风刮不掉。这一成就鼓舞了全体职工高度的工作热情。职员们在业余时间整理现场材料，协助工人搬运材料；监工员也亲自下手干了。
