State-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory Molding Workshop Workers
Learn from Liu Tonggao Group's "Circulation Method"
Increase National Grain Production by More Than 200 Tons in Four Months

    The workers of the molding workshop of the state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory have learned from the "Circulation Method" of the Liu Tonggao group and have greatly increased the wealth produced for the country.

    In January of this year, the Liu Tonggao sand molding group of the state-owned Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory, after research by labor model Liu Tonggao and the workers in the group, developed the "Circulation Method." The main characteristic of the "Circulation Method" is to give workers a certain circulation route during work and to achieve a reasonable division of labor. For example, in the past, sand molds were only arranged in one row, and workers returned empty-handed after completing one row of sand molds, wasting a lot of time. Now, the workers have increased the number of sand molds and rearranged them into two rows, doing the first row when going and the second row when returning. Mold making, mold repairing, and flask closing also follow such a circulation route. In this way, a lot of time can be saved and the waste of manpower reduced. In the past, the division of labor within the group was also extremely unreasonable. When a master and an apprentice worked together, either the master was doing the work and the apprentice was waiting, or the apprentice was doing the work and the master was waiting. Now, according to the difficulty of the work and the length of time it takes, the master and apprentice appropriately divide the labor. Due to the creation of this operating method, the Liu Tonggao group increased the production of certain machine parts from twelve per day to twenty-six, improving work efficiency by 116.6 percent, and also increased the percentage of qualified products from 84 percent to 97.8 percent. In the production of this type of machine part alone, the increase in production and savings in four months was equivalent to the value of three and a half tons of grain.

    After the Liu Tonggao group created this working method, the workers in the molding workshop all studied it and applied it to their own operations. After the Han Fengtong group applied the "Circulation Method" of the Liu Tonggao group, the work of making "cylinders" (a kind of part), wrapping straw ropes, and closing flasks all had a certain circulation route, which increased production efficiency by 50 percent. After more than ten days of research by the group leader Han Fengtong, the old method of flask closing was improved. In three months, the Han Fengtong group created wealth equivalent to one hundred and one and a half tons of grain. The head of the eighth group and Hu Xiaocheng used to make only thirty-two motor shells in two days; since learning the "Circulation Method," they have increased production to twenty-two per day, increasing production efficiency by 37.5 percent, and increasing the percentage of qualified products from 96.1 percent to 98.5 percent. In three months, the whole group created wealth equivalent to fourteen tons and four hundred catties of grain. Due to the promotion of the "Circulation Method," the workers in the molding workshop produced wealth equivalent to more than two hundred and ninety-five tons of grain for the country from January to April.

    国营青岛纺织机械厂模铸车间职工
    学习刘同诰小组的“循环工作法”
    四个月给国家增产二百多吨粮食
    国营青岛纺织机械厂模铸车间职工，学习了刘同诰小组的“循环工作法”后，给国家增产了很多的财富。
    国营青岛纺织机械厂刘同诰翻砂小组，在今年一月份，经过劳动模范刘同诰和组内职工的钻研，研究出了“循环工作法”。“循环工作法”的主要特点是使职工在工作时有一定的巡回路线，并做到合理分工。如过去砂模仅排列成一行，职工做完一行砂模以后，就空着手回来了，把很多时间浪费掉了。现在，职工把砂模加多，改排成二行，去的时候做第一行，回来时做第二行。制模、修模、扣箱等也都依着这样一个循环路线工作。这样，便可节省很多时间，减少了人力的浪费。过去，组内的分工也极不合理，师傅和徒弟合做一个活，不是师傅在做、徒弟在等，就是徒弟在做、师傅在等。现在，根据工作难易和消耗时间的长短，由师傅和徒弟适当分工。由于创造了这种操作方法，刘同诰小组制作某种机件，由过去每天制十二个增加到二十六个，提高了工作效率百分之一百一十六点六，正品率也由百分之八十四提高到百分之九十七点八。仅制造这一种机件，四个月就增产节约了相当于三吨半粮食的价值。
    刘同诰小组创造了这个工作法以后，模铸车间职工便都进行了学习，把它运用到自己的操作中去。韩凤桐小组运用了刘同诰小组的“循环工作法”以后，做“锡林”（一种零件）、缠草绳、扣箱等工作，都有一定的循环路线，使生产效率提高了百分之五十；又经组长韩凤桐十几天的研究，改进了旧的扣箱办法。三个月中，韩凤桐小组多创造了相当于一百零一吨半粮食的财富。第八组组长和胡孝成做某种马达壳，以前两天只做三十二个；自从学习了“循环工作法”以后，提高到每天做二十二个，生产效率提高了百分之三十七点五，正品率由百分之九十六点一提高到百分之九十八点五。在三个月中，全组多创造了相当于十四吨零四百斤粮食的财富。由于推广了“循环工作法”，模铸车间职工从一月份到四月份，多给国家生产了相当于二百九十五吨多粮食的财富。　（王守仁）
