Fearless Warrior
——Heroic Deeds of Cai Jintong, Volunteer Army First-Class People's Hero
Shi Licheng He Rihong

The leaders of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers recently jointly sent a letter of condolence to Cai Jintong, a first-class people's hero. The letter stated:

"Your heroic deeds of bravery, tenacity, and courage in single-handedly fighting the enemy in the ambush at Aguli, fighting on despite serious injuries, eliminating the enemy while holding your intestines in, and crawling back to the position, highly demonstrate the great spirit of patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism. You are a good son of the motherland, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and an excellent member of the New Democratic Youth League. In the Aguli ambush, more than sixty American bandits were wiped out, and you alone killed fourteen enemies and covered the safe transfer of the ambushing troops. You have made great contributions to the people, and we have approved you as a glorious first-class people's hero."

Cai Jintong is a soldier in a reconnaissance company of the unit. His heroic deeds have been widely spread on the Korean front. He is a fearless people's warrior.

One cold night, Cai Jintong was ordered, along with his platoon comrades, to ambush the enemy in Aguli, a small village west of Tieyuan. The enemy's position was south of the village, and a highway and a small river were north of the village. The north bank of the river was our army's position. American soldiers often came to Aguli in squads and platoons to harass. Our army soldiers had long planned to give these enemies a severe blow. When the unit set out to go there, Political Instructor Guo Shufa walked up to Cai Jintong and said, "In battle, Youth League members must be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Go wherever it is most urgent, and the more dangerous the situation, the more you must show that the Chinese people have a backbone of steel." Cai Jintong gripped his submachine gun and replied, "Please rest assured, Instructor. I know the responsibility of Youth League members, and I will definitely bring honor to the motherland in battle!" The unit then crossed mountains and rivers and advanced towards Aguli.

When the unit arrived at the ambush area, it was almost dawn, and the soldiers immediately dispersed to hide. Cai Jintong was ordered to stand guard on a small hill to watch for the enemy to the east of the village. The Party group leader instructed him, "If the enemy comes to reinforce, they must first occupy your hill. You must not leave that hill until our troops have withdrawn from the battle. After the troops have crossed the river, you can retreat along the base of the hill, and we will meet you on the other side of the river. You understand who we are fighting for, you must resolutely hold this position." After Cai Jintong assured the group leader, he immediately ran to the small hill.

At noon, the ambush began. After only four minutes of intense fighting, a squad of American troops that had sneaked into Aguli was completely wiped out. Afterwards, a large number of enemies came down from the mountains south of the village to reinforce, and enemy artillery also fired into the village. After the ambushing troops repelled the attack of the enemy reinforcements, they withdrew to the rear because it was not advisable to get entangled with a large enemy force.

At this moment, fifteen enemies from the east rushed towards the small hill guarded by Cai Jintong, attempting to cut off our army's retreat. Cai Jintong immediately put the lanyards of two hand grenades on his fingers, lay down under a pine tree, and stared at the enemies climbing up the hill. When the six in front got within thirty meters, Cai Jintong suddenly threw the hand grenades, and with two explosions, five fell on their backs. The remaining one howled and fled backwards, and was immediately shot dead by Cai Jintong's submachine gun. At this time, the nine enemies behind discovered that there was only one person guarding the top of the hill, and they bravely rushed up in two groups. Cai Jintong quickly changed his position, preparing to continue fighting. He used hand grenades and submachine guns to repel the enemies in front and then turned to fight the enemies on the side. But as he fired his third burst of bullets and threw his last hand grenade, his left wrist was broken by a flying bullet, and blood flowed from his forehead. He felt as if his whole body was burning, and shining golden stars burst out in his eyes. He turned to look behind him and saw the troops crossing the river. He thought, as long as I have a breath, I must resolutely complete the task! So he clenched his teeth and stood up, leaned his back against a pine tree, and used his right elbow to clamp the submachine gun to shoot. The remaining five enemies squeezed together and rushed up, and Cai Jintong shot down the three in front. At this moment, two hand grenades suddenly exploded beside him, a flash of fire flashed before his eyes, and his body leaned back and fell down the steep slope into the gully. When he came to his senses, he suddenly saw two enemies had reached a place only a dozen steps away from him. He struggled to stand up and quickly pulled the trigger of the submachine gun and shot down another enemy. The remaining one turned tail and ran away.

As soon as the battle ended, Cai Jintong fainted again. When he woke up, he felt unbearable pain in his abdomen. He struggled to sit up and saw that a section of intestines was flowing out, and the upper part of his right leg was also damaged. But the serious injury could not make the fearless warrior lose strength. He gritted his teeth and stuffed his intestines back into his belly, then pulled the broken left wrist and pressed it on the wound in his abdomen. By this time it was already dusk, and except for the explosions of one or two shells, there were no more gunshots. He looked north and saw that the mountains were high and the forests were dense on the other side of the river, and it was at least two li to walk to his position. It was very difficult for a seriously injured person to walk these roads. But Cai Jintong had an indestructible and strong will, and he had to crawl back to his position no matter what. He tried to lie down, and suddenly felt a sharp pain in his abdomen. Crawling was not an option. So he stood up abruptly; but the injury was so severe that his right leg could not stand still. At this moment, he remembered what the instructor said: "Youth League members must be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. The more dangerous the situation, the more you must show that the Chinese people have a backbone of steel..." He gritted his teeth, slung the submachine gun diagonally on his shoulders, and used his right arm to support the weight of his whole body and moved forward. After crawling about a hundred meters, the wound on his right leg touched the stones and small branches, and the severe pain caused him to faint again. When he woke up, the sky was full of stars. He knelt up and moved forward on his knees, but he fainted again when he moved to the small river. When he woke up again, there were few stars in the sky. He sat up in shock, thinking: It's almost dawn, I should hurry across the river. He wanted to break a branch to use as a crutch to cross the river, so he clamped a small tree with his right arm and tried his best to press it to the ground, but the small tree only cracked a small opening. He then used his teeth to gnaw, gnawing until his mouth was full of blood, but the small tree was finally gnawed off. He stood up with the tree trunk as a crutch and moved forward with difficulty. The water in the small river was knee-deep, and he endured the cold water, and had to stop every dozen steps, but he finally crossed the small river, one hundred meters wide. When he climbed to the north bank, the sun had already risen red from the east. He looked north and couldn't help but say happily, "I'm back!" Immediately, he suddenly felt exhausted and fell to the ground and fainted again.

The first to discover Cai Jintong were two sentries patrolling in front of the position. They saw that this blood-stained man was still breathing weakly, so they immediately called the stretcher-bearers to carry him to the battlefield dressing station for first aid. More than ten hours later, Cai Jintong woke up. The comrades at the dressing station notified Cai Jintong's company of this news.

After the ambush troops returned to the north bank, Cai Jintong had not returned. At night, the company sent people to the small hill in Aguli to search for him, but they only saw the enemy's corpses and did not see Cai Jintong's shadow. So the soldiers were very sad, and although they had won the battle, everyone had no smile. Now suddenly hearing that Cai Jintong had returned, they immediately sent someone to carry him back to the company. Everyone gathered around him. Instructor Guo Shufa was moved to tears and stroked his shoulder with his hand and said, "You are truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a good member of the Youth League. You were gloriously seriously injured, but you have resolutely completed the arduous task!"

Cai Jintong was sent back to the motherland for treatment, and his serious injuries are getting better day by day. Not long ago, he wrote to his comrades on the Korean front and said, "With the care of the people of the motherland and the meticulous treatment of the doctors, the wounds on my abdomen, forehead, and right leg are almost healed, but only one left hand was amputated. But I still have a right hand that can fire guns and throw hand grenades. I will return to the front line after my wounds are healed and continue to fight the American devils to the end!"

    无畏的战士
    ——志愿军一等人民功臣蔡金同的英雄事迹
    史立成　何日红
    中国人民志愿军某部的首长们在最近联名发出了一封给一等人民功臣蔡金同的慰问信。信上写着：
    “你在阿谷里伏击战斗中英勇顽强、孤胆杀敌、身负重伤、按腹奋战、消灭敌人、爬回阵地的英雄事迹，高度表现了爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义的伟大精神。你是祖国人民的好子弟，你是毛主席的好战士，你是一个优秀的新民主主义青年团团员。阿谷里伏击战共歼灭美国强盗六十多人，而你一个人就杀死了十四个敌人，并且掩护伏击部队安全转移。你对人民有很大的功劳，我们已批准你当一个光荣的一等人民功臣。”
    蔡金同是该部一个侦察连的战士。他的英雄事迹已在朝鲜前线被广泛地传颂着。他是一个无畏的人民战士。
    在一个严寒的夜间，蔡金同奉命和本排战友到铁原以西的一个小村——阿谷里去伏击敌人。这个村的南边是敌人的阵地，村的北边是一条公路和一条小河，河北就是我军的阵地。美国兵经常整班整排地到阿谷里来窜扰。我军战士们很早就计划着要给这些敌人一个狠狠的打击。这次部队出发到那里去的时候，政治指导员郭树发走到蔡金同的跟前说：“在战斗中青年团员要当毛主席的好战士，那里最紧急就到那里去，情况越危险越要显出中国人民是硬骨头。”蔡金同紧握着冲锋枪回答：“请指导员放心。我知道青年团员的责任，我一定要在战斗中给祖国增光！”随后部队就翻山过河，向着阿谷里前进。
    部队开到设伏区时，天快亮了，战士们立刻四散隐蔽。蔡金同受命到小山上去放哨，警戒村东的敌人。党的小组长嘱咐他说：“如果敌人来增援，他们就一定要先占据你这个小山。咱们部队还没有撤出战斗的时候，你是不能离开那座山的。等到部队过了河，你就沿山根撤回去，我们在河那岸接应你。你是明白我们是为谁打仗的，你要坚决撑住这个点。”蔡金同向小组长提出保证以后，就立刻跑到小山上去了。
    正午，伏击战打响了。仅仅经过四分钟的激烈交战，就全部歼灭了窜到阿谷里的一个班美军。事后，大批敌人从村南山上下来增援，敌人炮火也向村中打来。伏击部队击退敌人增援部队的攻击以后，因不宜和大股敌军纠缠，于是就向后转移。
    就在这时候，从东面来的十五个敌人扑向蔡金同警戒的小山，企图截断我军的退路。蔡金同即忙把两颗手榴弹的拉火索套在手指上，伏在一棵松树底下盯住爬上山来的敌人。等到前面的六个走近三十公尺时，蔡金同就猛然抛出手榴弹，两声爆炸，有五个仰面翻倒。剩下的一个嚎叫着向后逃，马上也被蔡金同的冲锋枪射死了。这时后边的九个敌人发现山头上只有一个人在守卫，就壮着胆子分两股扑上来。蔡金同很快换了个地方，准备继续战斗下去。他用手榴弹和冲锋枪打退了正面的敌人，又扭转身来打侧面的敌人。但当他打出第三梭子弹、投出最后一颗手榴弹的时候，左手腕被飞来的子弹打断了，额角上也淌下血来。他感到浑身像火一样的在燃烧，眼睛里迸发出闪耀的金星。他扭身看看后面，部队正在渡河。他想：只要我有一口气，就得坚决完成任务！于是就紧咬着牙站起来，背靠着一棵松树，用右臂肘夹着冲锋枪来射击。剩下的五个敌人挤成一团冲上来，蔡金同又打倒了前面的三个。这时突然有两颗手榴弹在他身旁爆炸，他眼前火花一闪，身子就向后仰跌，顺着陡直的山坡滚到山沟里。当他清醒过来时，猛然看见两个敌人已走到离他十几步的地方，他奋力站起，迅速扣动冲锋枪的扳机又打倒了一个敌人。剩下的一个就扭转屁股逃走了。
    战斗一结束，蔡金同又昏了过去。他醒来时觉得腹部疼痛难忍，挣扎着坐起来一看，肠子流出来一节，右腿的上部也带了花。但重伤并不能使无畏的战士丧失力量，他咬着牙把肠子塞进肚皮，然后拉过断掉的左手腕按在腹部的伤口上。这时天已经黄昏，四处除了一两声炮弹的爆炸，再没有枪声了。他向北望望，河那岸山高林密，走到自己的阵地至少有两华里。一个重伤的人要走这些路是十分困难的。但蔡金同却具有不可摧毁的坚强意志，他无论如何要爬回自己的阵地去。他试把身子伏下，骤然感到腹部剧痛，爬是不行的。于是他又陡地站起来；但伤势很重右腿实在站不住。这时他记起指导员说的话：“青年团员要当毛主席的好战士，情况愈危险愈要显出中国人民是硬骨头……”他咬一咬牙，将冲锋枪斜挂在肩膀上，用右臂使劲撑着全身的重量向前挪移起来。大概爬了一百公尺，右腿的伤口触着石头和小树枝，剧痛又使他昏厥过去。当他清醒过来时，天空已布满星辰。他跪起来用两膝向前移动，但移到小河边时又昏了过去。当他再次醒来时，天上星星稀少了。他惊心地坐起来，心想：天快亮了，应该赶过河去。他想折一根树枝当作拐杖拄着过河，于是他用右胳膊夹住一棵小树，用尽力量把它按倒地上，但小树只裂了一个小口。他接着用牙齿来啃，啃的满嘴流血，但小树终于被啃断了。他就拄着树干站起来，艰难地向前挪移。小河里的水有膝盖深，他忍受着寒水的侵袭，每走十几步就得停一停，但终于淌过了这条一百公尺宽的小河。当他爬上北岸的时候，太阳已经红艳艳的从东方升起。他望望北方，不禁愉快地说道：“我回来了！”旋即，他突然感到疲乏不堪，又倒在地上昏厥过去了。
    最先发现蔡金同的是在阵前巡逻的两个哨兵。他们看到这个浑身血迹的人还在低沉地呼吸，于是马上叫担架员把他抬到战地包扎所去进行急救。十几小时以后，蔡金同就清醒过来了。包扎所的同志便把这个消息通知蔡金同所在的连队。
    伏击部队回到北岸以后，一直不见蔡金同回来。夜间连里派人到阿谷里那座小山头上去寻找，但只看见敌人的尸体，却不见蔡金同的影子。所以战士们都很难过，虽然打了胜仗，大家却没有一点笑容。现在忽然听到蔡金同回来了，他们就马上派人把他抬回连里来。大家都围集在他的周围。指导员郭树发感动的含着眼泪，用手抚摸着他的肩头说：“你真是一个毛主席的好战士，青年团的好团员。你光荣地负了重伤，但你已坚决完成了艰巨任务！”
    蔡金同被送回祖国治疗，严重的伤势日益好转。不久以前，他写信给朝鲜前线的战友们说：“在祖国人民的爱护和医生们的细心诊治下，我的腹部、额部和右腿上的创伤都快好了，只是锯去了一只左手。但是我还有一只右手可以打枪打手榴弹，我要在伤口痊愈以后重上前线，继续和美国鬼子战斗到底！”　（新华社）
