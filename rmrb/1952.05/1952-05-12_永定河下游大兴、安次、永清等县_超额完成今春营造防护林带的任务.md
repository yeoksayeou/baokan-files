The construction work of the protective forest network in the lower reaches of the Yongding River in Hebei Province started on March 25th and ended on April 7th. According to preliminary statistics from 182 villages in four counties, including Daxing, Anci, Yongqing, and Gu'an, a total of 1319.9 *hua li* of main forest belts and 150.51 *hua li* of secondary forest belts were completed, totaling 1470.41 *hua li* (including 500 *hua li* built by the masses), exceeding the planned 1000 *hua li* for this spring. The main reasons for the successful completion of the protective forest network plan this spring are:

    1.  During the construction of the protective forest network this spring, protective forest construction committees were established in key counties and districts. The leading Party and government cadres served as the director and deputy director, directly controlling and promoting the protective forest construction work, which greatly increased the enthusiasm of general cadres and farmers for afforestation.

    2.  Fully mobilize the potential capabilities of the masses. In this afforestation work, the method of equivalent shareholding based on land quality, seedling quality, labor strength, etc., was adopted, implementing the spirit of mass cooperative afforestation. This not only successfully completed the task, but also saved state investment and expanded the afforestation plan.

    3.  Detailed preparatory work created conditions for completing the afforestation task. Before the construction of the protective forest, the planning and surveying of the forest belts were carried out first. The counties repeatedly explained the political and economic significance of building protective forests through people's representative conferences at all levels, district and village cadre conferences, village cadre and labor model conferences, and village mass meetings, and widely publicized the policy of "whoever plants it, owns it." When holding mobilization meetings for village cadres in key afforestation areas, the output of seedlings in each village and the quantity used by each village were specifically studied, and a regulatory plan for the supply and demand of seedlings was formulated, and special personnel were assigned to inspect and allocate seedlings.

    Before planting trees, various places proposed and implemented five checks (check leadership, check cadres, check organization, check tools, check seedlings) and four no-starts (no start without good surveying and planning, no start without sufficient seedling preparation, no start without good organization, no start without complete tool preparation). In the construction work, three speeds (fast organization, fast assembly, fast completion of tasks) and three goods (good propaganda, good mass response, good specifications) were achieved. Therefore, all counties completed this spring's afforestation task ahead of schedule within five days.

    4.  "Emphasis on quality over quantity," and "guarantee planting, guarantee survival, and guarantee forest protection" have become the main conditions for mutual challenges and responses among the masses. In order to master the specifications, farmers used ropes to draw lines for planting to maintain neatness and meet specifications. Most were able to achieve a deep burial of one *chi* and seven *cun*, and firm tamping, providing a guarantee for the survival of forest belt trees.

    永定河下游大兴、安次、永清等县
    超额完成今春营造防护林带的任务
    河北省永定河下游防护林网的营造工作，从三月二十五日开始，到四月七日止，据大兴、安次、永清、固安等四县一百八十二个村的初步统计，完成了主林带一千三百一十九点九华里，副林带一百五十点五一华里，总计共完成林带一千四百七十点四一华里（包括群众营造的五百华里），超额完成了今春营造一千华里的计划。今春顺利完成防护林网计划的主要原因是：
    一、在今春营造防护林网工作中，各重点县、区都建立了防护林营造委员会。当地党政负责干部担任正副主任，直接掌握和推动了防护林营造工作，大大提高了一般干部和农民的造林热情。
    二、充分发挥群众的潜在能力。在这次造林工作中采用根据土地好坏、苗木质量、劳力强弱等等价入股的办法，贯彻了群众合作造林的精神。这样不但顺利完成了任务，而且节省了国家投资，扩大了造林计划。
    三、细密的准备工作，为完成造林任务创造了条件。在防护林营造以前，首先进行了林带的规划和测量工作。各县通过各界人民代表会议、区村干部大会、村干部和劳动模范大会、村群众大会等，反复讲解了营造防护林的政治意义和经济意义，广泛宣传了“谁种归谁”的政策。在重点造林地区召开村干部动员大会时，具体研究了各村树秧的产量和各村使用的数量，制定了树秧供求的调剂计划，采取专人专事进行了树秧的检查和调拨。
    在栽树以前，各地提出和贯彻了五查（查领导、查干部、查组织、查工具、查树秧）和四不开工
    （测量规划不好不开工、树秧准备不足不开工、组织不好不开工、工具准备不齐不开工），在营造工作中做到了三快（组织快、集合快、完成任务快），三好（宣传好、群众反映好、规格好）。因此，各县都在五日内超计划完成了今春造林任务。
    四、“重质不重量”，“保栽、保活、保证护林”成为群众相互挑战应战的主要条件。为了掌握规格，农民都用绳子拉线栽植，以保持整齐和合乎规格。大都能做到一尺七寸的深埋，实砸，给林带树木的成活提供了保障。
