    County Chief Kang Yuan of Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province, Leads the Masses to Extinguish Aphids in Time

    Editor: After receiving reports of aphids in wheat fields in the Third and Fourth Districts, Kang Yuan, the County Chief of Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province, immediately went to the wheat fields in the suburban area to carefully inspect them. He immediately discovered that the wheat fields in the suburban area also had aphids, and the situation was very serious. That evening, he convened a meeting of cadres from relevant departments such as the Agricultural and Forestry Section and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, as well as representatives from villages in Chengguan Township, to discuss methods for extinguishing and preventing aphids, and called on everyone to mobilize the masses of the city, especially women and children, to participate in the pest control work. Early in the morning of April 14th, he took a sprayer and led a pest control team of more than 160 people to the wheat fields in the suburbs to kill aphids. Although there was a strong wind and the weather was bad that day, everyone's enthusiasm was still very high due to the thorough mobilization beforehand. By the evening, all the aphids in more than 250 mu of wheat fields in the suburbs had been eradicated. The masses were very satisfied with this and praised: The People's Government is our own, and the county chief even helps us fight aphids!

    山西中阳县县长康远领导群众及时扑灭了蚜虫
    编辑同志：山西省中阳县县长康远在接到第三、第四区麦地发生蚜虫的报告后，立刻到城郊区麦地仔细检查，当即发现城郊区的麦地也有蚜虫，并且情况很严重。当天晚上，他就召集农林科、供销社等有关部门干部及城关各村代表开会，讨论扑灭和防治蚜虫的办法，号召大家动员全城群众特别是妇女儿童参加灭虫工作。四月十四日一早，他拿着喷雾器，率领了一百六十余人的灭虫队伍，到城郊麦田中灭虫。虽然这天刮大风，天气恶劣，但因事前进行了深入动员，大家的情绪仍是很高。到晚上，城郊二百五十余亩麦田中的蚜虫便全部被扑灭了。群众对这件事很满意地赞扬说：人民政府就是咱人民自己的，县长还帮咱打蚜虫哩！    施国珍
