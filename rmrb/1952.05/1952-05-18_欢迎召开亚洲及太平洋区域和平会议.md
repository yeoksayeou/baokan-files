    Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference
    The proposal to convene the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, initiated by eleven well-known figures in our country dedicated to the cause of peace, representing the will of our people, has received enthusiastic responses from peace-loving people in relevant countries. With the agreement of the initiators from various countries, it has been decided to hold a preparatory meeting in Beijing on the 28th of this month. This fully demonstrates the ardent desire for peace and the firm will to act together to strive for peace among the people of Asian and Pacific countries. Undoubtedly, this is a significant step in the current struggle to defend world peace.
    The peace of the Asian and Pacific region is suffering from serious disruption and threats. Although the US imperialist policy of aggression in Asia has suffered successive and severe setbacks, it is still not reconciled to its defeat. On the one hand, it continues to be arrogant and unreasonable in delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, and is carrying out heinous bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. On the other hand, it illegally declared the unilateral "Japanese Peace Treaty" effective, stepping up the rearmament of Japan and organizing a Pacific aggressive bloc in preparation for a new war of aggression. This series of war steps by US imperialism is clearly an attempt to further push the entire Asian and Pacific coastal countries into the abyss of war, so that the big Wall Street financiers can continue to reap bloody war profits. At present, the people of Korea and Vietnam are still suffering from the ravages of imperialist wars of aggression. The Japanese people are living a painful life of enslavement under American occupation and are being forced to serve as tools for the United States to expand its war of aggression. The people of other countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts are either the targets of American aggression and attack, or the objects of American plundering of war resources and conscription of cannon fodder. The imperialist countries, especially the wars of aggression carried out by US imperialism in Asia and the preparations for launching new wars, have threatened the peaceful lives of all the people in Asia and the Pacific coastal countries. This is why the people of these countries are now rising up in unison to respond to the call for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.
    As the eleven well-known figures in our country dedicated to the cause of peace pointed out in their initiative: "Peace cannot be waited for; peace requires peace-loving people to unite and strive for it." As long as the people of Asia and the Pacific region strengthen their unity and act in unison, and take on the cause of defending peace, the war plans of US imperialism can be completely defeated. Therefore, convening the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to promote the unity of the people of Asia and the Pacific region, and to enable peace-loving people from various countries to gather together to seek appropriate measures to defend peace, is extremely important for the peace of Asia and the Pacific region and the whole world.
    We, the Chinese people, are fighting to defend peace. We warmly welcome peace-loving people from all countries to come to our country to attend the conference, and we are willing to make every effort to ensure the early convening of this conference. We firmly believe that this united and peaceful conference will not only bring about a new upsurge in the peace movement in the Asian and Pacific region, but will also bring about closer relations of friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.

    欢迎召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    我国努力和平事业的十一位著名人士，代表我国人民的意志，发起召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的主张，已得到有关各国爱好和平人士的热烈响应，并经各国发起人的同意，决定于本月二十八日在北京举行筹备会议。这充分表现了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民对和平的热切愿望和共同行动以争取和平的坚决意志。无疑的，这在当前保卫世界和平的斗争中，是具有重大意义的步骤。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的和平正遭受着严重的破坏和威胁。美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策虽已连续遭到严重的挫败，但是它依然死不甘心。它一面继续蛮横无理地拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，并向中朝人民进行万恶的细菌战，一面非法宣布片面的“对日和约”生效，加紧重新武装日本，组织太平洋侵略集团，以准备新的侵略战争。美帝国主义的这一系列的战争步骤，显然是企图进一步把全亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国推入战争的深渊，来为华尔街的大财主们继续捞取血腥的战争利润。现在，朝鲜和越南人民仍遭受着帝国主义侵略战争的蹂躏，日本人民在美国的占领下过着痛苦的被奴役的生活，并正被强迫着充当美国扩大侵略战争的工具。亚洲及太平洋沿岸的其他国家的人民，或者是美国侵略和进攻的目标，或者是美国掠夺战争资源和搜罗炮灰的对象。帝国主义国家，尤其是美帝国主义在亚洲所进行的侵略战争及其发动新战争的准备，使全亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国人民的和平生活都已受到了威胁。这就是这些国家的人民现在一致奋起响应亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议发起书的原因。
    正如我国努力和平事业的十一位著名人士在发起书中所指出的：“和平绝不能坐待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。”只要亚洲及太平洋区域的人民加紧团结，一致行动，把保卫和平的事业担当起来，美帝国主义的战争计划是完全可以打败的。因此，为促进亚洲及太平洋区域人民的团结，并使各国和平人士聚会一堂，寻求保卫和平的适当措施，而召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，对于亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界的和平都是极端重要的。
    我们中国人民正为保卫和平而斗争，我们热烈欢迎各国爱好和平人士到我国来开会，并愿为这一会议的早日召开而尽一切努力。我们深信：这一个团结的、和平的会议不仅将带来亚洲及太平洋区域的和平运动的新高潮，而且也将带来各国人民间进一步友好合作的亲密关系。
