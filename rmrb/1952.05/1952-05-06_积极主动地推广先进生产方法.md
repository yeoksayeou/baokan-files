    Actively and proactively promote advanced production methods

    In some cotton textile factories, after the workers in the spinning workshops learned the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method," the phenomenon of insufficient roving occurred. Some factories were slow to resolve this problem, which more or less hindered the promotion of the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method." The workers in the roving workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Northeast China collectively created a relatively complete set of roving operation methods, which solved the problem of insufficient roving supply. This is worth learning from by cotton textile factories across the country.

    The reason why the workers in the roving workshop of the Jinzhou Textile Factory were able to create such a relatively complete set of roving operation methods is mainly because the leading cadres planned and organized the workers to learn and create advanced production methods. They adopted a proactive approach to solving the problem of the roving supply not meeting the needs of the spinning workshops, instead of bowing their heads in the face of objective difficulties and stopping their progress. After they went deep into the workshops and discovered this problem, they relied on the masses and gave play to the creativity and wisdom of the masses to solve this problem. At the same time, they maintained a humble learning spirit and discussed and researched with the masses. When some workers were skeptical of advanced experiences, they actively carried out persuasion and education. They did not pay lip service to the importance of advanced experience, but used positive actions to promote advanced experience. They specifically helped twenty-seven workers study and create a relatively reasonable set of roving operation methods.

    After the great "Three-Anti" Movement, the workers in all factories are more eager to improve technology and produce more wealth for the country. The fact that twenty-seven workers from the Jinzhou Textile Factory voluntarily signed up to participate in the performance of creating roving operation methods is one example. The production enthusiasm of the masses is generally high now. As long as the leading cadres attach importance to the promotion of advanced experience, and rely on the worker masses to solve the difficulties in the promotion work, advanced production methods can not only be promoted, but also be further developed and improved. Here, the Jinzhou Textile Factory has created a good example, and textile factories across the country should learn from them well.

    积极主动地推广先进生产方法
    有些棉纺织厂，在细纱间职工学会了“郝建秀工作法”后，发生了粗纱不够用的现象。有的厂曾因这个问题迟迟未得解决，或多或少地阻碍了“郝建秀工作法”的推广。东北锦州纺织厂粗纱车间职工集体创造了比较完整的一套粗纱操作法，解决了粗纱供应不上的问题。这是值得各地棉纺织厂学习的。
    锦州纺织厂粗纱间职工所以能够创造出这样一套比较完整的粗纱操作法，主要是因为领导干部有计划、有组织地领导了职工学习和创造先进生产方法。他们对粗纱供不上细纱间需要的问题，采取了积极主动设法解决的态度，而不是在客观困难面前低头踟蹰，停止前进。他们深入车间，发现了这个问题之后，就依靠群众，发挥群众的创造性和智慧来解决这个问题。同时，他们抱着虚心学习的精神，和群众一起商量、研究。有些工人对先进经验抱怀疑态度，他们便积极进行说服教育。他们不是空谈重视先进经验，而是用积极的行动来推进先进经验，他们具体地帮助二十七个职工研究创造了一套比较合理的粗纱操作法。
    经过伟大的“三反”运动之后，各厂职工都更迫切地要求改进技术，为国家生产更多的财富。锦州纺织厂二十七个职工自动报名参加创造粗纱操作法的表演，便是一例。群众的生产热情现在一般是高涨的，只要领导干部重视先进经验的推广工作，并依靠工人群众，解决推广工作中的困难，先进生产方法不但可以推广，而且可以更加发展、提高。在这里，锦州纺织厂已经创造了好的范例，全国各纺织厂应该很好地向他们学习。
