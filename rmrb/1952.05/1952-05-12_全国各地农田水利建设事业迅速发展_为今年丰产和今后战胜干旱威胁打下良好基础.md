    Rapid Development of Farmland Water Conservancy Construction Across the Country
    Lays a Good Foundation for This Year's Bumper Harvest and Future Victory Over Drought Threats
    Across the country, peasant masses are actively building farmland water conservancy projects and reforming the original canal management system in the drought prevention and resistance movement. This not only creates favorable conditions for this year's bumper harvest but also lays a good foundation for long-term production and construction.
    In North China and Inner Mongolia, which are known for "nine droughts in ten years," the masses were generally mobilized to build water conservancy projects starting in early March this year, and preliminary achievements have already been made. The entire North China region originally had 28.25 million mu of irrigated land, accounting for 11% of the cultivated area. This year, the plan is to dig 194,000 wells, produce 149,000 waterwheels, and increase and renovate existing canals. With strengthened irrigation management, a total of 11.45 million mu of irrigated land can be added, bringing the total irrigated area to 39.7 million mu. In addition, Hebei Province temporarily dredged dikes in the spring to secure irrigation for 2 million mu of land. Hebei and Pingyuan provinces plan to dig 1.8 million earthen wells, which can irrigate approximately 5.4 million mu of land. The two combined can guarantee 7.4 million mu of land will be free from drought disasters in the spring and summer. The canal construction projects are progressing rapidly. As of early April, Pingyuan Province had basically completed the plan. Hebei Province has completed more than one-half of the original plan, and the remaining projects are under intensive construction. By the end of March, the entire region had completed 58,800 water wells, accounting for 30% of the annual plan. In terms of earthen wells, Hebei had completed 410,000 wells, and Pingyuan had completed 100,000 wells. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where water conservancy was extremely underdeveloped in the past, farmers in various leagues and banners are determined to vigorously develop water conservancy under the call for drought prevention and increased production this year. They have already dug 25,000 water wells, and more than 85,000 are under construction. It is expected that the plan to dig 160,000 wells can be completed by mid-May, expanding the irrigated area by 150,000 hectares (approximately 2.25 million mu), equivalent to 10% of the existing cultivated land area.
    Water conservancy construction in the vast areas of Northwest and Northeast China is developing from key areas to comprehensive development. The Northwest region plans to expand irrigated land by 3.16 million mu. Projects such as digging canals, digging wells, excavating springs, and building small reservoirs have been launched in various places. In the Northeast region, there was generally no habit of irrigating dry land in the past. Due to the development of the drought prevention and resistance movement, farmers in some areas often threatened by drought have also successively launched well-digging and canal-opening movements since March. Provinces such as Liaoxi, Rehe, Heilongjiang, and Songjiang have all made some achievements.
    In the southern provinces, some water conservancy projects were built and renovated last autumn and winter. This year, due to more spring rain, spring repair projects were mostly delayed by about a month. After the weather cleared in early March, a tense spring repair movement was launched. In areas with rapid progress, the project plan has been fully completed or is close to completion. For example, Jinua, Ningbo, and other five special districts in Zhejiang Province have completed more than 92,000 water conservancy projects, benefiting a total of 2.88 million mu of farmland. More than 76,000 ponds, dams, ditches, and other projects in northern Anhui have been mostly completed. In the southern Jiangsu area, more than 90,000 projects such as dikes, weirs, ponds, culverts, and sluices have been repaired. Fujian Province has repaired more than 24,000 water conservancy projects of various sizes. By the end of March, Guangdong Province had completed 10,000 small water conservancy projects such as mountain ponds, culverts, and wells, and 17 medium-sized projects are under construction. It is estimated that after all the projects are completed, a total of 2.34 million mu of farmland will benefit, ensuring an increase of 1.4 million dan of rice. In Jiangxi Province, the completed dike renovation projects have exceeded the annual plan. In Hubei Province, four special districts, including Xiaogan and Huanggang, have completed more than 70% of the water conservancy project plan. In the Southwest region, most areas have experienced drought and lack of rain this spring. In addition to carrying out various water conservancy construction projects according to the original plan, each province and region also launched a "Drought Resistance Activity Day," mobilizing the masses to dig wells, open springs, find water sources, and use waterwheels to irrigate fields. As of March, the completed small water conservancy projects in the entire region exceeded twice the total for the entire year of last year, capable of irrigating more than 3 million mu of farmland. In the past, there were very few ponds and dams in rural areas of the Southwest. Now, except for a few high mountain areas, each village has at least two ponds on average. Currently, all localities are inspecting the completed ponds and weirs.
    In short, with the development of the drought prevention and resistance movement, the farmland water conservancy business is rapidly developing. In areas with developed water conservancy in the southern provinces, the scope of water conservancy construction is continuing to expand, the quality of projects has significantly improved, and the progress of projects is also faster than in previous years. In the more arid areas of the north, the irrigation business is also developing extensively, especially well irrigation in the vast plains. In many places, farmers previously did not have sufficient understanding of the benefits of well irrigation and lacked confidence in digging wells. Now, digging wells has become a conscious action of the masses. For example, in Chahar Province and Suiyuan Province, there were very few irrigation wells before liberation, and they were only used to irrigate vegetable gardens and fields for planting special cash crops. In the two or three years after liberation, although great efforts were made to expand well irrigation, the number of wells added each year in each province did not exceed one or two thousand. Before the end of March this year, Chahar Province alone added 20,000 wells, and Suiyuan, just Jining Special District, has already completed and is constructing more than 10,000 wells. The number of wells that other provinces are expected to complete will also exceed several times that of previous years. Secondly, water conservancy in mountainous areas has also begun to develop. These areas are high in altitude, lack water sources, and are most severely threatened by drought. Farmers who have suffered from the pain of drought for a long time have overcome various difficulties this year under the universal call and strong leadership of the government, and have begun to focus on building dams, controlling mountain gullies, building ponds, reservoirs, and water cellars and other drought prevention projects, laying a good foundation for water conservancy in mountainous areas. Thirdly, the situation of water accumulation causing harm in low-lying areas in the past was relatively serious. Therefore, these areas often focused on passively preventing and controlling water damage. However, in drought years or drought seasons, they also suffer from drought like other areas. This year, these areas have also changed their previous concept of passively preventing floods and have begun to carry out water conservancy projects that combine flood prevention and drainage with water storage and irrigation, transforming water damage into water conservancy, based on the principle of combining drought prevention and flood control.
    The utilization of existing irrigation water sources is also gradually improving. In the northern provinces, due to the fact that the dates of water release from irrigation canals have mostly been advanced by twenty days to a month, and the reform of the management and water use system, coupled with the fact that farmers in many areas have launched a "cherish water" movement and widely promoted reasonable water use methods such as shallow watering, quick watering, and day and night rotation watering, the amount of water used per unit area has been greatly saved, and the irrigated area has expanded accordingly. The canals of southern Chahar are universally experimenting with the promotion of the advanced irrigation method that combines agriculture and water conservancy of water conservancy model worker Zhang Lianshi's "unified planting of miscellaneous fields and distributed water use," which is a major reform in irrigation. In terms of waterwheel and well irrigation, it is being promoted to organize joint irrigation in order to further exert the potential of irrigation. Many model workers and activists are leading and organizing numerous farmers to cooperate and help each other in irrigation, which will not only fully exert the irrigation efficiency of waterwheels and wells, but also greatly save the labor and animal power consumed in irrigation.

    全国各地农田水利建设事业迅速发展
    为今年丰产和今后战胜干旱威胁打下良好基础
    全国各地农民群众在防旱抗旱运动中积极兴修农田水利工程，改革原有渠道管理制度，不但为今年丰产创造了有利条件，并且为长期生产建设打下良好基础。
    “十年九旱”的华北和内蒙地区，今年一般从三月上旬就开始普遍发动群众兴修水利，现在已有初步成就。华北全区原有水地二千八百二十五万亩，占耕地面积百分之十一，今年计划打井十九万四千眼，出贷水车十四万九千部，连同增开整修旧有渠道，并加强灌溉管理，共可增加水地一千一百四十五万亩。连同原有水地面积共可达三千九百七十万亩。此外河北省春季临时扒堤争取浇地二百万亩，河北、平原两省计划打土井一百八十万眼，约可浇地五百四十万亩，两项合计共可保证七百四十万亩地春夏不受旱灾。兴修渠道工程进展较快，到四月上旬为止，平原省已基本完成计划，河北省全部竣工的工程已达原计划的二分之一以上，其余工程正在突击施工。至三月底止，全区共完成水井五万八千八百眼，占全年计划的百分之三十。土井方面，河北已完成四十一万眼，平原已完成十万眼。内蒙古自治区，过去水利事业极不发达，今年在防旱增产的号召下，各盟、旗农民决心大力开展水利，现已打好水井二万五千眼，正在动工的还有八万五千多眼，预定在五月中旬可完成打井十六万眼的计划，扩大灌溉面积十五万垧（约合二百二十五万亩），相当于现有耕地面积的百分之十。
    西北、东北广大地区的水利建设正在由重点向全面发展。西北区计划扩大水地三百一十六万亩，开渠、打井、掏泉、修建小型蓄水等工程已在各地展开。东北区过去一般没有灌溉旱地的习惯，由于防旱抗旱运动的开展，一些常常受到旱灾威胁地区的农民，自三月开始，也先后展开打井开渠运动，辽西、热河、黑龙江、松江等省都已有了部分成就。
    南方各省，在去年秋冬已完成了部分水利工程的兴建和整修，今年因春雨较多，春修工程大都推迟了一个月左右；三月初天气放晴后，就掀起了紧张的春修运动，进展快的地区，工程计划已全部完成或接近完成。例如浙江省金华、宁波等五个专区已完成水利工程九万二千多处，受益田亩共二百八十八万亩。皖北七万六千多处塘坝、沟渠等工程已大部完成。苏南区已修好圩堤、堰、塘、涵、闸等工程九万多处。福建省共修好大小水利工程二万四千余处。广东省到三月底共完成山塘、涵洞、水井等小型水利工程一万宗，十七处中型工程正在大举兴工；估计全部工程完成后，受益田亩共二百三十四万亩，可保证增产稻谷一百四十万担。江西省目前完成的圩堤整修工程已超过全年计划。湖北省有孝感、黄冈等四个专区已完成水利工程计划的百分之七十以上。西南区，今春大部地区天气干旱缺雨，各省区除了按原定计划进行各项水利建设外，并发动广大的群众，举行了“抗旱活动日”，到处掀起挖井、开泉，寻找水源及车水灌田运动。截至三月为止，全区已修成的小型水利工程，超过去年全年两倍，能灌溉三百多万亩农田。过去，西南农村塘坝很少，现在除少数高山地区以外，平均每个村庄至少有了两个水塘。现在，各地都在检查已完工的塘堰。
    总之，随着防旱抗旱运动的开展，农田水利事业已在迅速地向前发展。南方各省水利发达的地区，水利建设的范围正在继续扩大，工程质量都有显著的提高，工程进度也较往年为快。在北方较为干旱的地区，灌溉事业也有广泛的发展，尤以广大平原地区的水井灌溉，发展最为显著。很多地方的农民，以往对水井灌溉的效益没有足够认识，对打井缺乏信心；现在打井已成了群众的自觉行动。例如察哈尔省和绥远省，在解放前灌溉井是很少的，并且只是用来灌溉菜园和种植特种经济作物的田地，解放后二、三年来，虽然经过大力扩展水井灌溉，各省每年增加水井的数量不过一两千眼；而今年三月底以前，察哈尔一省增加的水井就有两万眼，绥远只集宁一个专区已经完成和正在施工的水井就在一万眼以上。其他各省预定完成水井的数量也将超过往年好几倍。其次是山区的水利事业也开始发展起来。这些地区地势高亢，水源缺乏，受旱灾的威胁最为严重。经过长时期旱灾的痛苦的农民，今年在政府的普遍号召和坚强领导下，战胜各种困难，开始了重点筑坝、闸山沟、修建水塘、蓄水池、水窖等防旱工程，为山区的水利事业打下很好的基础。再次是低洼地带，过去积水为害的情形是比较严重的，因此这些地区常是偏重于消极的防治水害；但是，在干旱年成或干旱季节，也和其他地区同样受着旱灾的危害。今年这些地区也转变了以往消极防水的观念，开始在防旱和防涝相结合的原则下，举办防洪排水兼顾蓄水灌溉的水利工程，变水害为水利。
    对现有灌溉水源的利用，也在逐步地提高。北方各省的灌溉渠道，由于放水日期大都提前了二十天到一个月，和管理用水制度的改革，再加很多地区的农民开展“爱水惜水”运动，广泛提倡浅浇、快浇、昼夜轮浇等合理用水的办法，单位面积的用水量大为节省，浇地面积随之扩大。察南各渠道普遍试行推广水利模范张连仕的“杂田统一种植分排使水”的农业与水利相结合的先进灌溉方法，这是灌溉上的一项重大改革。在水车水井灌溉方面，正在提倡组织起来合伙浇地，以求进一步发挥灌溉的潜在能力。很多劳动模范和积极分子带动和组织着众多的农户合作互助浇地，不但水车水井的灌溉效能将充分发挥起来，在灌溉中所耗费的劳力、畜力也将大量节省。    （徐达）
