Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 24th: The All-Pakistan Peace Conference was held in Lahore, West Pakistan, on May 17th and 18th. Participants included representatives from all parties and factions across Pakistan, poets, writers, lawyers, journalists, and leaders of the democratic women's movement. The three-person presidium chairing the conference consisted of lawyer Kasuri, Karachi Peace Committee Secretary Muntaz Hussain, and Northwest Frontier Province representative Umar Farooq.

Faridabadi, Secretary of the Conference Preparatory Committee, reported on the situation of the peace movement among the people of Pakistan, stating that over 100,000 people in West Pakistan had signed the Stockholm Appeal. In Lahore, 41,000 people had signed the World Peace Council's declaration calling for the five major powers to conclude a peace pact, while 24,000 had signed in Karachi, and a total of 15,000 in other locations. This signature campaign is still ongoing.

The conference resolved to establish the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, electing Manki Sharif as Chairman and Professor Hai of Karachi as Secretary-General. The conference also elected seventeen executive committee members.

The conference unanimously passed resolutions supporting the struggle of the Tunisian people, demanding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt, Sudan, and Tunisia; calling for disarmament; endorsing the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council's resolutions on the Near East and Middle East; demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact; calling on the governments of Pakistan and India to resolve the Kashmir dispute through consultation; and appealing to peace committees and cultural organizations throughout Pakistan to commemorate the millennium of Avicenna's birth.

The conference also passed a resolution expressing heartfelt welcome to the leaders of the Chinese peace movement for initiating the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing and vehemently condemning "the American military's use of bacteriological weapons against the people of northern Korea and northeastern China." The resolution pointed out that the use of bacteriological weapons is an act of utter moral depravity and violates all codes of civilization.

The conference also passed a resolution on China stating: "The conference believes that without the participation of representatives of the 500 million people of China, who constitute one-fourth of the world's total population, the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations are undemocratic and violate the Charter, and are therefore illegal and invalid."

    【新华社新德里二十四日电】全巴基斯坦和平大会于五月十七日和十八日在西巴基斯坦的拉合尔举行。参加大会的有来自巴基斯坦全国各地各党派的代表、诗人、作家、律师、新闻工作者和民主妇女运动的领袖。主持大会的三人主席团是：律师卡苏里、喀喇蚩和平委员会秘书蒙塔兹·胡赛恩和西北边省代表乌玛尔·法汝克。
    大会筹备委员会秘书法里达巴第在报告巴基斯坦人民和平运动的情况时说：在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的，在西巴基斯坦有十万多人。在世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约宣言上签名的，在拉合尔已有四万一千人，在喀喇蚩有二万四千人，在其他地方共有一万五千人，这个征集签名的运动仍在继续进行中。
    大会决议成立全巴基斯坦和平委员会，并选出曼基·沙里夫为委员会主席，喀喇蚩的哈伊教授为秘书长。大会还选出了十七人为执行委员。
