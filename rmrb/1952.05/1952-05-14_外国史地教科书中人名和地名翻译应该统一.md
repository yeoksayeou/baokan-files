    Translation of Foreign History and Geography Textbook Names and Places Should Be Unified

    Currently, the translation of foreign history and geography textbooks' names and places in schools at all levels is not yet uniform. Often, the same name or place, due to different translations, makes it impossible to recognize them as the same person or place. For example, the reactionary "National Assembly" speaker during the Paris Commune era in France is translated as "Tuier" in the "Junior High School Foreign History Textbook," but as "Tihai'er" in the "Senior High School Outline of Modern Foreign History." This not only creates unnecessary difficulties for teachers when teaching, but also increases the difficulty for students in memorizing. Therefore, we hope that the People's Education Publishing House will quickly unify the translation of names and places in foreign history and geography textbooks.

    外国史地教科书中人名和地名翻译应该统一
    现在各级学校外国史地教科书中的人名地名翻译得还不统一。往往同一个人名或地名，由于翻译的不同，竟使人看不出是同一个人或同一地方来。例如，法国巴黎公社时代的反动“国民议会”议长，在“初级中学外国历史课本”中被译为“退耳”，在“高级中学外国近代史纲”中却被译为“梯亥尔”。这就不但使教师在教课时发生一些不必要的困难，并且增加了学生记忆的困难。因此，我们希望人民教育出版社赶快把外国史地教科书中人名和地名的翻译统一起来。
