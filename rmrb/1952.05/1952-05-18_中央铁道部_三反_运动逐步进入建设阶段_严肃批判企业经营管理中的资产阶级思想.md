The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Railways has gradually entered the construction phase. The current situation of the People's Railways is that democratic reforms are nearing completion and are about to enter a historical phase centered on production reform. The Ministry of Railways is conducting a serious critique of bourgeois ideologies in railway enterprise management and technical thinking in order to lay an ideological foundation for the upcoming production reform.

People's Railways are socialist, state-owned enterprises, owned by the people and serving the people. They are enterprises that adhere to overall and long-term interests, and are full of creative spirit. Therefore, planned management has become the basic characteristic of People's Railways. In terms of enterprise management, it relies on the working class and fully utilizes their enthusiasm and creativity to improve labor productivity. The fundamental laws and methods of socialist enterprise management have matured in the Soviet Union, and our People's Railways' management methods and technology are learning from advanced Soviet experience. In the past three years, planned transportation has been implemented in transportation, the national passenger freight rates (except for a small section in the Yunnan area) have been unified, the "three-responsibility system" and soft water treatment methods have been implemented in locomotive operations, and advanced Soviet experiences have been learned and promoted in other departments, enabling railway transportation efficiency to reach unprecedented heights in the history of Chinese railways, and greatly strengthening planning. At the same time, thanks to their participation in the democratic reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, and the patriotic anti-American and aid-Korea movement over the past three years, the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of workers in the national railway system have been greatly improved, and many inventions and rationalization proposals have emerged in various localities and departments. However, many units in the railway system still retain corrupt bourgeois conservative ideas. This conservatism, as manifested in management and technical thinking, means not relying on workers to fully exploit the internal potential of enterprises to improve efficiency. Many engineering and technical personnel use outdated technical standards and old methods to resist the implementation of new methods created by workers.

Zheng Xikun, an advanced driver from the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Changchun Railway, pioneered over-axle traction with the help of Soviet experts. When over-axle traction was promoted under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party branch in the depot, it encountered many obstacles due to conservative thinking. In order to solve the difficulty of starting "over-axle trains," Zheng Xikun created the method of "compressing couplers and starting sequentially," which reduced the total resistance when the train started. He also used water softening agents and improved fire-stoking methods, theoretically and technically breaking the American bourgeois "Kilgore" algorithm that used machines to limit human power. The "Kilgore" algorithm emphasizes the structure of the locomotive and places people in a subordinate position, rigidly stipulating that the total resistance per kilogram of weight is eight kilograms when starting. Zheng Xikun used "human creation" to break the bourgeois "Kilgore" algorithm formula, reducing the total resistance per kilogram of weight to six and a half kilograms. In order to increase technical speed, Zheng Xikun created a new locomotive operating method of "opening the steam valve wide and raising the handle high" for "forced acceleration," breaking the old operating method of "opening the steam valve slightly and lowering the handle low" for "natural acceleration" inherited from the past. Because he fully utilized his enthusiasm and creativity and truly became the master of the machine, his locomotive MK1-105 became the locomotive banner that continuously set new records for over-axle and 500 kilometers. However, when the over-axle and 500-kilometer movement was launched throughout the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, it encountered resistance from conservative thinking. Some technicians with conservative ideas seized on the incident of locomotive MK1-801 driver Li Ziguo pulling 3,062 tons between Sujiatun and Lishan on April 28, 1950, and finding a small smoke tube leak upon return, and heavily publicized the conservative idea that locomotives should not be overloaded. It was not until the Chinese Communist Party branch of the depot and Soviet experts investigated and found that the small smoke tube leak was caused by substandard maintenance quality, etc., that the re-emerging conservative thinking was crushed with concrete facts, and the 500-kilometer over-axle movement was successfully launched.

The residual bourgeois ideology existing in the management of car departments also greatly hindered the implementation of the advanced Li Xikui shunting method in some units. The main feature of the Li Xikui shunting method is that, contrary to the past when shunters could not make their own plans, they make their own daily train marshalling and shunting plans, so that they can work proactively and become the masters of the shunting yard. In terms of working methods, it breaks the shackles of the old work system, adopts continuous operation methods in everything, and uses advanced Soviet experience such as continuous gravity shunting, so that switchmen, signalmen, and brakemen can all work simultaneously according to the shunters' tasks, shortening the time vehicles stay at stations and greatly increasing productivity. However, this major creation of car department workers – the Li Xikui shunting method – encountered great resistance in some areas when it was promoted in various places. Qi Yonghe, deputy director of operations at Shijiazhuang Station, nominally promoted the Li Xikui shunting method, but in his heart, he believed that the old shunting method he had learned in the past was correct, so he deliberately mixed up the plans and operations, causing vehicle congestion for three days, and then said "the Li Xikui shunting method is not working," and restored his old shunting method. Qi Yonghe has been removed from his post in the "Three-Anti" movement. Conservative thinking in transportation work is also manifested in hindering the promotion of the advanced Soviet experience of trains passing straight through stations. After continuous struggle, the Li Xikui shunting method was implemented. The Car Department Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has initially liquidated the bourgeois ideology in enterprise management in the "Three-Anti" movement and established a shift system of Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and a collective office system on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Thanks to the establishment of this new system, eleven rationalization proposals from the masses of workers that had been backlogged since 1951 due to bureaucracy have been processed and work has been improved during the recent joint office hours.

Many technicians in the public works department, due to their blind faith in bourgeois conservative technical standards, severely limited the speed of locomotives when passing over bridges that did not require slow running. This conservative thinking is most prominently manifested in the debate over the major repair or reconstruction of the Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Line. The Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Line is the longest bridge in China. After this bridge was built in 1900, engineers from capitalist countries limited its driving speed to 20 kilometers per hour, with a warranty period of 15 years. Later, the driving speed of this bridge was further reduced to 5 kilometers per hour. After Japan surrendered, the five-kilometer section from the South Yellow River Station to the North Station alone required three hours of running time. The Kuomintang reactionary government invited so-called American experts to inspect the bridge; after a cursory look, he immediately proposed a plan to rebuild the bridge, and the design fee alone cost 100,000 US dollars. After the Beijing-Hankou Line was liberated in 1949, many engineering and technical personnel, due to their long-term reliance on a set of conservative railway management methods and technical thinking from capitalist countries such as the United States and Japan before liberation, were deeply poisoned by ideology and still followed the old bourgeois management system for the Yellow River Bridge, emphasizing that the bridge had exceeded its warranty period and could no longer be used, hoping to build a new bridge; they did not pay attention to the maintenance of the bridge and opposed increasing the driving speed after reinforcement. When Soviet experts inspected and repeatedly drilled the Yellow River Bridge, believing that if the bridge was reinforced and attention was paid to maintenance, not only could the speed be increased, but it could also continue to be used normally, an engineer from the Public Works Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and general engineering and technical personnel from the Zhengzhou Railway Administration expressed opposition to the reinforcement and replacement of beams. They believed that the Ministry of Railways' requirement that heavy locomotives pass at normal driving speed was unprecedented since the construction of the Yellow River Bridge. However, in January 1950, after initial repairs to the damaged piers and beams and tidying up the bridge deck, a train was pulled across the bridge by two small locomotives, and the running time from the South Yellow River Station to the North Station was reduced to 22 minutes, only one-eighth of the original three hours. Later, all the steel beams were reinforced, and in September 1950, large "MK6" locomotives were used, which could travel 15 kilometers per hour. In 1951, the work of reinforcing the piers and replacing the beams was carried out again, and the speed limit was lifted on January 16 this year, and the bridge crossing speed was changed to 30 kilometers per hour, and the entire long bridge could be crossed in six minutes. The various units under the Public Works Bureau of the Ministry of Railways are currently criticizing the harmfulness of bourgeois conservative thinking in enterprise management based on the stark contrast between the good and bad results caused by the two essentially different management methods and technical thinking of socialism and capitalism.

The bourgeois ideology existing in some units also hindered the promotion of advanced Soviet experience. The promotion of the advanced Soviet experience of "filling and tamping soil" in new road construction also went through a period of ideological struggle. Even more prominent is that last year, a working group jointly formed by Soviet experts and the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the Tianjin Railway Administration specifically helped to promote advanced Soviet experiences such as class plans and technical operation process charts at Tianjin East Station, but the engineer of this station, after the working group left the East Station, used the excuse that the instruction manuals for the technical operation process charts, etc., had run out, and brought out his own set of old methods again. It was not until the person in charge of the Tianjin Bureau went to inspect that he discovered this phenomenon of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant behavior, and strictly ordered the implementation of advanced Soviet experience, and decided to punish the engineer. Due to the renewed implementation of advanced Soviet experience, the work of this station not only turned from bad to good, but also won the Red Flag in March this year.

The bourgeois ideology existing in the railway department is also manifested in the following aspects: Some units, due to the influence of bourgeois management thinking, have a great deal of blindness in their plans. Without consulting the Ministry of Railways, the Northeast Railway blindly and arbitrarily built a huge marshalling yard at Dachengshan-Shanhaiguan, which did not meet the actual needs and caused huge waste to the country. The restoration of the double-track project between Tuozitou and Shanhaiguan on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Line, and the related station and yard extension track projects, due to poor planning, made some projects that were not urgently needed, and accumulated 3.7 billion yuan of state funds. Some units have the idea of lacking an overall concept, starting only from their own unit. The Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau applied to the Ministry of Railways for 245 tons of tool steel in mid-1950. However, after the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways purchased the tool steel, the Northwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau never came to collect it, accumulating a lot of funds. The Southwest Railway Trunk Line Engineering Bureau wasted sleepers when the country needed a large number of timber. Their bridge engineering team used more than 2,000 sleepers to pad steel beams, resulting in the damage of more than 1,000 sleepers. This lack of an overall concept even developed to the point of disobeying orders from superiors. For example, the Public Works Department of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration disobeyed the instructions of superiors and refused to allocate a batch of steel rails collected within their jurisdiction to the Tianjin and Taiyuan Administrations, which urgently needed steel rails to carry out the reconstruction project of the North Tongpu Railway. Some railway engineering designs and capital construction caused great waste to the country because the construction leaders lacked the sense of ownership of accumulating wealth for the country, penny by penny. In the 1951 Shi (Shijiazhuang) - Tai (Taiyuan) Line reconstruction project, many bridges had to be built. There are many stone mountains on both sides of this route, which can obtain a large amount of cheap stone materials, and there are many stonemasons along the route who can be hired; however, the leaders of the engineering construction and many technicians believed that "stone bridges are too backward, it is easier to use reinforced concrete," so they transported cement and steel bars from afar, and hired cement workers. It was only after Soviet experts pointed it out that it was corrected, but it had already wasted 1 billion yuan for the country. The original design of this route itself had a great waste. In the "Three-Anti" movement, inspections and audits were carried out, and more than 20% could be reduced.

In the "Three-Anti" movement, the Ministry of Railways also criticized the "masterpiece thinking" of some engineering and technical personnel. Some engineering and technical personnel with strong bourgeois technical thinking, in order to show their "high" skills, did not proceed from reality and made some designs for the People's Railways that were completely unsuitable for needs. Qi Zhigai, chief of the Station Affairs Section of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, copied all the so-called latest designs of capitalist countries in his design of the Paomaquan Station. However, after research by Soviet experts, it was found that Paomaquan did not need to set up a station at all. The signal equipment of Chongqing, Jiulongpo and other stations on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway originally only needed 400 million yuan; however, Wang Xicheng, a consulting engineer of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, redesigned it without considering the actual needs of the workload, which would cost 1.3 billion yuan. Later, it was discovered and corrected by the leaders of the Ministry of Railways in time, which avoided a huge waste. Wang Xicheng still boasted himself as "China's number one signal design expert." All the projects he designed required American materials and were all American regulations. When the management personnel took the purchase order he opened to ask him, he replied: "You take it to the United States, and they will naturally know!"

In the process of opposing bourgeois management thinking and technical thinking, the Ministry of Railways also initially criticized the corrupt American worship thinking that still existed in some technicians. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央铁道部“三反”运动逐步进入建设阶段
    严肃批判企业经营管理中的资产阶级思想
    中央人民政府铁道部反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已逐步进入建设阶段。目前人民铁道的情况是：民主改革接近完成，即将进入以生产改革为中心的历史阶段。铁道部正对铁路企业经营管理和技术思想中的资产阶级思想进行严肃的批判，以便为即将来临的生产改革打下思想基础。
    人民铁路是社会主义性质的、国营的企业，为人民所有又服务于人民。它是服从整体利益和长远利益的、充满创造精神的企业，因此，计划经营成为人民铁路的基本特点。它在企业经营管理上，依靠工人阶级，充分发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性来提高劳动生产率。社会主义企业的经营管理的根本规律与方法在苏联已有了成熟的经验，我们人民铁路的经营管理方法和技术是学习苏联先进经验的。三年来，在运输方面实行了计划运输，统一了全国
    （除云南地区一小段外）客运运价，在机务方面实行了三包负责制，软水投药法等，在其他各部门也都学习和推行了苏联先进经验，使铁路运输效率达到我国铁路史上空前的高度标准，计划性也大大加强。同时全国铁道系统工人由于三年来参加了民主改革运动、镇压反革命运动、抗美援朝爱国主义运动，政治觉悟和劳动积极性大大提高，各地各个部门都有很多发明创造和合理化建议。但铁路系统中不少单位还残存着腐朽的资产阶级的保守思想，这种保守思想表现在经营管理和技术思想上的，便是不依靠工人充分发挥企业内部潜在力量来提高效率。许多工程技术人员拿陈旧的技术标准和老办法来抗拒工人创造的新办法的推行。
    中长路苏家屯机务段先进司机郑锡坤在苏联专家帮助下，首创超轴牵引。当超轴牵引在该段中国共产党支部领导下推行时，就曾遇到许多保守思想的阻碍。郑锡坤为了解决“超轴列车”起车的困难，创造了“压缩车钩，依次分别起动”的起车方法，减少了列车出发时的总抵抗，他又使用了软水剂和改进了焚火方法，从理论上、技术上打破了美国资产阶级用机器来限制人力的“凯吉尔”算法。“凯吉尔”算法强调机车的构造，把人放在从属的地位，死板地规定起车时重每公斤的总抵抗是八公斤。郑锡坤用“人的创造”打破了资产阶级的“凯吉尔”算法的公式，使重每公斤的总抵抗减少到六公斤半。郑锡坤为了提高技术速度，又创造了“大开汽门，高提手把”的“强迫加速机车”的新的机车操纵法，打破了旧时遗留下来的“小开汽门，低提手把”的“自然加速”的旧操纵法。由于他高度发挥了积极性和创造性，真正成了机器的主人，他驾驶的冖ㄎ1一零五号机车成为不断创超轴、五百公里新纪录的机车旗帜。但超轴、五百公里运动在苏家屯机务段全段开展时，又遭到保守思想的抵抗。一些有保守思想的技术人员，抓住了冖ㄎ1八零一号机车长李自国在一九五零年四月二十八日，在苏家屯到立山间超轴牵引三千零六十二吨，回来后发现机车小烟管泄漏的事情，就大事宣传机车不应超轴的保守思想。直到该机务段中国共产党支部和苏联专家调查出小烟管泄漏是因检修质量不合标准等原因所致，才以具体事实粉碎了重又抬头的保守思想，使五百公里超轴运动顺利展开。
    存在在车务部门经营管理中的残余的资产阶级思想，也使某些单位在推行先进的李锡奎调车法时遭遇到很大的阻碍。李锡奎调车法的主要特点，是一反过去调车员不能自己做计划，而自己做当天的编车、调车计划，这样就可以主动干活，使调车员成为调车场的主人。在工作方法上打破了旧工作制度的束缚，一切都采取连续作业法，采用苏联的连续溜放调车法等先进经验，使搬道员、信号员、连结员都能根据调车员的任务同时进行工作，缩短车辆停站时间，大大提高生产率。但车务部门工人的这一重大创造——李锡奎调车法在各地推行时，在某些地区却遭到很大的阻力。石家庄车站运转副主任齐永和对李锡奎调车法表面推行了，心里却认为他自己过去所学的旧调车法才对，就故意把计划和作业搞错，造成三天车辆堵塞，然后说“李锡奎调车法不成呀”，又恢复他的旧调车法。在“三反”运动中，齐永和已被撤职。运输工作中的保守思想，又表现在阻碍推行列车直线通过车站这一苏联先进经验。经过了不断斗争，李锡奎调车法才得贯彻推行。铁道部车务局在“三反”运动中初步清算了企业经营管理中的资产阶级思想，建立星期一、三、五交班制，二、四、六集体办公制度。由于建立了这个新制度，在最近联合办公时间内，已处理了一九五一年由于文牍主义而积压的十一件职工群众的合理化建议，改进了工作。
    工务部门许多技术人员，由于迷信资产阶级保守的技术标准，把机车经过不需要慢行的桥梁时的速度限制得很小。这种保守主义的思想最突出地表现在京汉线黄河大桥的大修或重建的争论上。京汉线黄河大桥是中国第一长桥。这个桥在一九零零年兴建后，资本主义国家的工程师把它的行车速度限定为每小时二十公里，保固期限十五年。后来这个桥行车速度更降低为每小时五公里。日本投降后，单黄河南站到北站五公里区间，运行时间需要三小时。国民党反动政府请美国的所谓专家来察看这个桥；他匆匆看了一下，就立刻提出必需重修新桥的计划，单只设计费一项就用了十万美金。一九四九年京汉线获得解放后，许多工程技术人员由于在解放前长期地依靠美国、日本等资本主义国家的一套保守主义的铁路经营管理方法和技术思想办事，思想中毒很深，对黄河大桥仍沿用着旧的资产阶级的经营管理制度，强调这个桥已超过保固期限，不能再用，希望另建新桥；对这个桥不注意养护，同时反对加固后提高行车速度。当苏联专家视察并反复钻探了黄河大桥，认为这个桥如经加固并重视养护，不但可以提高速度，而且还可以继续正常使用下去时，铁道部工务总局的一个工程师和郑州铁路管理局的一般工程技术人员对加固换梁表示反对。他们认为铁道部要求以通常行车速度通过重型机车，是建筑黄河大桥以来从没有过的。但是，一九五零年一月，经过初步修补坏桥墩和坏梁，整理了桥面，一列列车用二台小型机车牵引过桥，从黄河南站至北站，行车时间缩短到二十二分钟，仅为原来所需三小时的八分之一。后来又把全部钢梁加固，一九五零年九月改行“冖ㄎ六”大型机车，一小时能走十五公里。一九五一年又进行了加固桥墩及换梁工程，至今年一月十六日取消了慢行限制，过桥速度改为一小时三十公里，六分钟即可过完这座长桥。铁道部工务总局所属各单位，目前正在根据社会主义和资本主义这两种本质不同的经营管理方法和技术思想所造成的好坏结果的鲜明对比，来批判资产阶级保守思想在企业经营管理中的危害性。
    某些单位中存在的资产阶级思想，也阻碍了苏联先进经验的推行。新路建设中的苏联先进经验“填土打夯”的推行，也是经过了一番思想斗争的。更突出的是，去年苏联专家和铁道部运输局和天津铁路管理局合组的工作组，曾在天津东站具体帮助推行苏联先进经验班计划、技术作业过程表等，但这个车站的工程师，等工作组一离开东站，就藉口技术作业过程表等说明书用完，就又把他自己的一套老办法搬出来。直到天津局负责人去检查，才发现这种阳奉阴违的现象，严令贯彻推行苏联先进经验，并决定处分这个工程师。由于重新贯彻推行苏联先进经验，这个车站的工作不仅由坏转好，并在今年三月份获得了红旗。
    铁道部门中存在的资产阶级思想，还表现在以下几方面：某些单位由于受到资产阶级经营管理思想的影响，计划有很大的盲目性。东北铁路未请示铁道部，在大城山海关盲目地擅自兴筑一个巨大的操车场，结果和实际需要不符合，给国家造成极巨大的浪费。京山线拕子头、山海关之间恢复双线工程，及有关站、场延长股道工程，由于计划不周，做了一些不是急需的工程，积压国家资金达三十七亿元。某些单位中存在着只从本单位出发缺乏整体观念的思想。西北铁路干线工程局于一九五零年中向铁道部申请工具钢二百四十五吨。但铁道部材料局购办好这项工具钢后，西北铁路干线工程局却始终未来领取，积压了不少资金。西南铁路干线工程局在国家需要大批木材时浪费枕木，他们的桥梁工程队以枕木二千多根垫钢梁，结果损坏一千多根。这种缺乏整体观念的思想，甚至发展到了违抗上级命令的程度。如郑州铁路管理局工务部门便曾违抗上级指示，不肯把他们管辖范围内收集的一批钢轨调拨给当时十分急需钢轨进行北同蒲路改线工程的天津、太原两管理局。某些铁路工程设计和基本建设，由于施工负责人缺乏一分一文地为国家积聚财富的主人翁思想，给国家造成很大的浪费。一九五一年石（石家庄）太（太原）线改线工程中要修建许多桥梁。这条路线两旁多是石山，可以取得大量廉价石料，沿线并有许多石工可以招雇；但是工程建设的领导人和许多技术人员却认为“用石桥太落后了，不如用钢骨水泥省事”，因此从远处运来洋灰、钢筋，招来水泥工人。后经苏联专家指出才加以改正，但已给国家浪费了十亿元。这条路线原设计本身就有很大的浪费。在“三反”运动中，进行了检查审核，能减去百分之二十多。
    在“三反”运动中，铁道部还批判了一部分工程技术人员的“杰作思想”。有些有浓厚资产阶级技术思想的工程技术人员，为了表现自己的本领“高”，不从实际出发，为人民铁道作出了一些完全不切合需要的设计。铁道部设计局站务课课长齐植概在他所作的跑马泉车站设计中，把资本主义国家所谓最新式的设计全部搬了来。但经苏联专家研究，跑马泉在目前根本还没有设站的必要。成渝铁路重庆、九龙坡等站的号志设备，原设计只需四亿元；但铁道部设计局顾问工程师王禧成不考虑业务量实际需要，重加设计，要花十三亿元。后经铁道部领导方面发现后及时予以纠正，才避免了一笔巨大的浪费。王禧成却还自夸为“中国第一名信号设计专家”。他所设计的工程全部需用美国材料，全部是美国规程。管理人员拿着他开的定货单去问他，他回答说：“你拿到美国去，他们自然知道了！”
    铁道部在反对资产阶级经营管理思想和技术思想过程中，同时也初步批判了某些技术人员中还存在着的腐朽的崇美思想。（新华社）
