Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 17th—In April, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army continued to achieve new victories on the battlefronts of ground operations, air defense operations, and anti-bacterial warfare and anti-chemical warfare.

Ignoring the angry protests of just world opinion, the American aggressors continued to spread bacteria-laden insects and poisons on the front lines and in the rear areas of Korea in April. At the same time, the American aggressors systematically released poison gas and conducted chemical warfare. According to reports from the front-line troops, the enemy army fired 24 poison gas bombs at our front-line positions in April, an increase of 8 times compared with the 16 times in March. Most of these poison gas bombs were suffocating poison gas bombs. However, these inhumane methods of the American aggressors cannot have any effect on the just people's army and the awakened people. The Korean and Chinese people and their armies continue to quickly and effectively eliminate the bacteria-carrying insects and poisons spread by the American aggressors, and effectively prevent and quickly extinguish the diseases caused by the enemy's chemical and bacterial warfare.

On the defense line across the central part of the Korean Peninsula, the strong and powerful soldiers of the Korean and Chinese people are constantly annihilating the enemy's effective strength, causing the enemy to continue to suffer heavy losses in personnel and equipment. In April, our army fought a total of 146 battles with the enemy, annihilating 9,897 enemy troops, including 4,092 American troops. During this month, the enemy army launched 84 attacks on our army using tactics such as position attacks, raids, and ambushes, but each time they were defeated by our army and suffered heavy casualties. Our army's 62 counterattacks, raids, and ambushes against the enemy annihilated even more of the enemy's effective strength. In just a few counterattacks, our army annihilated ten full platoons and the majority of one company and two platoons of the enemy. Our army's elite sharpshooters carried out a sniper movement on the front-line positions, causing the enemy to be subjected to fatal shooting at any time. All this shows that our army's combat effectiveness is increasing and our tactics are becoming more skillful.

The defense line currently defended by our army was built after the victory of the Fifth Campaign in May last year. Our army commanders and combatants have displayed great creativity and unyielding fighting spirit, firmly defending and increasingly consolidating this defense line, killing and wounding more than 330,000 enemy troops in more than ten months. Although the American aggressor army has a large number of artillery, aircraft, and tanks, and the enemy army fires an average of 20,000 to 30,000 shells at our army's positions every day, they have never been able to destroy our army's positions.

Our army's artillery units have been further strengthened and are constantly engaging in fierce artillery battles with the enemy, causing the enemy to suffer heavier losses. On the coastline, our coastal defense heavy artillery often engages in artillery battles with enemy ships, and the number of enemy ships sunk or damaged is increasing day by day. The U.S. Far East Naval Command had to admit that enemy ships' harassment activities on our coast had been increasingly restricted due to our fierce artillery fire.

Our army has continued to achieve major victories in air defense operations. Under the heavy blows of the Korean and Chinese people's air defense units, the "authoritative officials" of the U.S. aggressor army's Fifth Air Force felt that the air situation was "dangerous" and had to admit that "the air force simply cannot cut off all the supplies of the communist ground forces" and that "Operation Strangle has failed." Since the beginning of April, the enemy air force has changed its tactics again, adopting a method of focusing on surprise attacks on our rear areas in an attempt to destroy our transportation. However, under the effective strikes of our air defense units, the enemy air force continued to fail. In April, our army shot down or damaged 486 enemy aircraft. The effect of the enemy air force's bombing and strafing over our front-line positions was also very small. Our army's front-line troops continued to carry out an air defense shooting movement, using rifles and machine guns to shoot down or damage many enemy aircraft. The soldiers of our army on the Maliangshan position on the western front shot down or damaged 13 enemy aircraft in April alone.

The victories of the Korean and Chinese People's Army on all fronts fully prove the correctness of Commander Peng Dehuai's assertion that "our army is getting stronger and stronger in battle, and the enemy army is getting weaker and weaker in battle." The facts also show that the American aggressor army's difficulties of insufficient troop sources and low morale are deepening day by day. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Collins admitted that "the United States simply does not have a single active-duty division to replace or reinforce the troops in Korea." The U.S. Department of Defense has repeatedly revised its rotation method for the invading army in Korea, attempting to alleviate the difficulty of insufficient troop sources by extending the service time of its soldiers. But this has made the morale of those soldiers who have long yearned to return home even lower. Taking its air force personnel as an example, many of those once arrogant American air force pilots are now refusing to fly for fear of losing their lives, and it is said that they "refuse to take off even if they are sued in military court." As for the low morale of the enemy's army, there is no need to say it.

However, the American generals are afraid of war but even more afraid of a truce. They are stubbornly insisting on their unreasonable demand to detain 100,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side in the Korean armistice negotiations in order to obstruct the armistice negotiations and collect cannon fodder for the United States to expand its war of aggression. In order to achieve this despicable and shameless goal, the American aggressors launched artillery attacks on our army's positions in the area outside Panmunjom, the site of the Korean armistice negotiations, in late April, massively rotated troops on the front line, and conducted frequent transportation in the rear. All commanders and combatants of the Korean and Chinese People's Army resolutely oppose the American aggressor army's shameful conspiracy to detain a large number of our captured personnel, and are doubly vigilant, ready to crush all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks at any time.

The main combat results of our army in April are as follows:

1.  A total of 9,897 enemy troops were killed or wounded, including 4,092 American aggressor troops, 133 British and Canadian accomplice troops, and 5,672 Li pseudo-army troops.

2.  Main captures: 3 anti-aircraft guns, 2 rocket launchers, 1 flamethrower, 7 heavy machine guns, 34 light machine guns, 245 other various guns, 2 radios, 22 various intercoms, 1 night vision device, 3 wooden boats, and a batch of ammunition.

3.  186 enemy aircraft were shot down, 300 enemy aircraft were damaged, a total of 486 enemy aircraft were shot down or damaged. 50 enemy tanks were destroyed, 17 enemy tanks were damaged. 107 enemy vehicles were destroyed or damaged. 26 enemy artillery pieces of various types were destroyed.

    我军愈战愈强继续获得新胜利
    朝中部队四月份歼敌近万
    击落击伤敌人飞机四百八十六架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十七日电】在四月份中，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在地面作战，对空作战及反细菌战、反化学战的战线上继续取得新的胜利。
    美国侵略者不顾世界正义舆论的愤怒抗议，四月份继续在朝鲜的前线和后方大量撒布带有细菌的毒虫、毒物。同时美国侵略者又有计划地施放毒气，进行化学战。据前线部队的报告，敌军四月间向我前线阵地投射毒气弹二十四次，较三月份的十六次增加八次。这些毒气弹大部是窒息性毒气弹。但是，美国侵略者这些灭绝人性的手段对于正义的人民军队和解放了的觉悟的人民群众，不能产生什么作用。朝中人民及其军队继续迅速有效地扑灭美国侵略者撒布的带菌毒虫、毒物，有效地防止和迅速地扑灭由于敌人的化学战、细菌战所造成的疾病。
    在横贯朝鲜半岛中部的防御战线上，身强力壮的朝中人民战士们不断地歼灭着敌军有生力量，使敌军在人员和装备上继续蒙受大量消耗。在四月份内，我军和敌军作战共达一百四十六次，歼灭敌军九千八百九十七名，其中美军占四千零九十二名。在这个月内，敌军用阵地攻击、袭击、伏击等战术向我军进犯八十四次，但每次都被我军击败，并遭到惨重的杀伤。而我军向敌人进行的六十二次反击、袭击和伏击的战斗，更多地歼灭了敌人有生力量。仅在几次反击战中，我军即歼灭敌军十个整排和一个连、两个排的大部。我军特等射击手们在前沿阵地上开展狙击运动，使敌军随时受到致命的射击。这一切都表明我军战斗力的愈益提高和战术的更加巧妙。
    我军目前防守的阵线，是在去年五月间第五次战役胜利结束后筑成的。我军指挥员战斗员发挥了伟大的创造力和坚毅不拔的战斗精神，坚守并日益巩固着这一防御阵地，十个多月中杀伤敌军约三十三万多名。尽管美国侵略军拥有大量大炮、飞机和战车，敌军平均每天向我军阵地发炮达两万至三万发，却始终不能摧毁我军阵地。
    我军炮兵部队已进一步加强，并不断地和敌人展开猛烈炮战，使敌军损失加重。在海岸线上，我海防巨炮经常和敌舰进行炮战，击沉击伤的敌军舰只已日益增多。美国远东海军司令部不得不承认敌舰在我海岸进行侵扰活动，已因我炮火猛烈而受到越来越大的限制。
    我军在对空作战方面继续获得重大胜利。在朝中人民对空作战部队的沉重打击下，美国侵略军第五航空队的“权威官员”感到空中形势“险恶”，不得不承认“空军简直不能切断共军地面部队所有的供应”，“绞杀战已经失败”。从四月初起，敌空军又改变战术，对我后方采取重点突袭的方法，妄图破坏我交通运输。但在我对空作战部队的有效打击下，敌空军继续遭到失败。在四月份中，我军即击落击伤敌机达四百八十六架。敌空军在我前线阵地上空进行轰炸、扫射的效果也很微小。我军前线部队继续展开对空射击运动，用步枪和机关枪击落击伤许多敌机。西线马良山阵地上的我军战士，即在四月份，击落击伤敌机十三架。
    朝中人民军队在各条战线上的胜利，充分证明了彭德怀司令员所作的“我军愈战愈强，敌军愈战愈弱”的论断的正确性。事实也说明：美国侵略军兵源不足、士气低落的困难正日益加深。美国陆军参谋长柯林斯供认“美国现在根本没有一个现役的师来代替或者增援朝鲜的军队”。美国国防部曾一再修改其在朝侵略军的轮换办法，企图用延长其士兵服役的时间来缓和其兵源不足的困难。但这却使那些早已渴望回家的士兵的士气更加低落。即以其空军人员为例，那些曾经骄横一时的美国空军驾驶员，现在竟有不少因害怕丧命而拒绝飞行，据说他们“即使被告到军事法庭也拒绝起飞”。至于敌人陆军士气低落的情形，就不必说了。
    然而美国的将军们既怕战争却更怕停战。他们正在朝鲜停战谈判中蛮横地坚持其扣留朝中方面十万名被俘人员的无理要求，以阻挠停战谈判，并为美国扩大侵略战争搜罗炮灰。美国侵略者为了达到这个卑鄙无耻的目的，在四月下旬曾在朝鲜停战谈判会议地址板门店外围地区，向我军阵地发动炮击，在前线大肆轮调军队，在后方进行频繁的运输。朝中人民军队的全体指挥员、战斗员，坚决反对美国侵略军扣留我方大批被俘人员的可耻阴谋，并加倍警惕，准备随时粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计。
    四月份我军作战的主要战果如下：
    一、共计毙伤敌军九千八百九十七名，其中包括美国侵略军四千零九十二名，英国和加拿大帮凶军一百三十三名，李伪军五千六百七十二名。
    二、主要缴获：机关炮三门，火箭筒两个，火焰喷射器一具，重机枪七挺，轻机枪三十四挺，其它各种枪枝二百四十五枝，电台二部，各种通话机二十二架，夜探镜一部，木船三只，弹药一部。
    三、击落敌机一百八十六架，击伤敌机三百架，共击落击伤敌机四百八十六架。击毁敌战车五十辆，击伤敌战车十七辆。击毁击伤敌汽车一百零七辆。击毁敌各种炮二十六门。
