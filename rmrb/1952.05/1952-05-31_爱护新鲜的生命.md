    Cherish Fresh Life
    Guo Moruo

    Children and young people are humanity's fresh life, the most valuable driving force for national construction. Human progress, national and ethnic development, all depend on today's children and young people, and the children and young people of future generations. Taking China as an example, to enable our country to rapidly develop socialist and communist construction after completing the task of new democratic construction, we must rely entirely on the strength of today's and future children and young people.

    Therefore, how to cherish our national life, how to cultivate our creative driving force, is truly a fundamental issue related to national construction and human progress. We must strengthen our vitality, so that as many of our present and future children and young people as possible can have noble sentiments, healthy bodies, and creative wisdom, and all become labor-loving, creative people's heroes who can contribute to the country and to humanity.

    There are many things that should be done to achieve this goal, everyone has a role to play, and there is work to do every moment. Vigorously develop our spirit of patriotism and internationalism, do a good job in our national construction, and eliminate the crisis that is undermining the cause of peace and construction. This can ensure the safety of today's and future children and young people, allow them to grow and develop smoothly without disaster or difficulty, and pass on the banner of patriotism and internationalism to the next generation.

    But specifically for children's work, there is also much we should do. Children should receive good care from the moment they are in the womb. In ancient times, there was something called "prenatal education," and from a scientific point of view today, it is still worth paying attention to. We hope that more and better nurseries can be established, which will require great effort. The foundation of our national education system is early childhood education. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have attached great importance to early childhood education and primary education in terms of educational administration. We have made great improvements in the school system and curriculum, which has led to a dramatic increase in the number of schools and students. In particular, the children of workers, peasants, and ethnic minorities have increased opportunities to attend school. We are now working hard to ensure that primary education is universal throughout the country within ten years, so that there are no more out-of-school children.

    Supplementary tools outside of formal children's education are generally still in their infancy today. Children's books and picture magazines are pitifully few compared to the number of children in China. The inaugural issue of the "China Young Pioneers News," which is welcomed by children and young people, only printed 70,000 copies, but in six or seven months, it has increased to 480,000 copies, more than six times as many. This proves how urgent the need for extracurricular reading materials is for children and young people. But China has tens of millions of children and young people, and yet there are only 480,000 copies of this young pioneer's news, the reach is still narrow, is it not worthy of our special attention? Today, we do not have films and slides aimed at children. We should say that the spiritual famine of Chinese children has still not been well resolved.

    The new China has only been established for two years and eight months, and our achievements in construction are generally very amazing. Achievements in less than three years are equivalent to the past three thousand years. But because our country is large, the population is large, and it has been stagnant for too long under reactionary rule, it takes a lot of effort to rescue backwardness and restore wounds. It is impossible to attempt to do everything at once in just over two and a half years. In another ten or eight years, we have a guarantee to build China into a paradise for children and young people like the Soviet Union. Many tasks require a certain material foundation, such as increasing the number of schools and teachers, establishing children's cultural palaces, and producing large numbers of children's films and slides, all of which cannot be rushed out overnight. But today I want to appeal to our writers and artists – to appeal for rescuing the spiritual famine of Chinese children: please create more children's literature and children's art works for Chinese children! Produce more and better children's books and picture magazines, I think we currently have such a material foundation, but our writers have not paid enough attention to the importance of this work.

    Good children's literature is not only an excellent tool to assist children's education, but also can educate adults; it can be particularly effective for the current work of eliminating illiteracy. The target of eliminating illiteracy is workers, peasants and soldiers, and works specifically aimed at workers, peasants and soldiers cannot be completely applicable to children; but works aimed at children can be applied to workers, peasants and soldiers at the same time. Therefore, writing for children and young people today does not violate the principle that literature and art should mainly serve workers, peasants and soldiers.

    The enemy of peace is the enemy of children. Today, the leader of the aggressive camp, the United States, is using all tools such as literature, art, film, radio, books, periodicals, and toys to train children and young people to become murderers from an early age. Under the influence of so-called literary and artistic works in the United States, criminal behavior among American children and young people is gradually increasing. This influence has spread to countries controlled by the United States. For example, the number of juvenile delinquents in Japan was 28,000 in 1945, but under American control, it had increased to 75,000 by 1948. We not only have a responsibility to educate our children, but also have a responsibility to rescue children under the influence of the enemy of peace. I believe that good children's literature and art has this power, we should be good at using this form of children's literature and art to fulfill our responsibility to educate humanity and defend peace.

    The highest ideal of literature and art should be to express content of equal height in morality and artistry in an accessible form. Literature and art aimed at workers, peasants and soldiers must be accessible, and literature and art aimed at children and young people must be especially accessible. To express things in an accessible way, so that workers, peasants and soldiers or children and young people can receive profound education – new democratic or socialist education, that is the highest practice of "going deep and coming out shallow" that we idealize, and it is also the specific opposition to "using difficulty to hide shallowness" that we oppose. Good literature and art is invariably accessible, pure and simple. Once literature and art is divorced from the people, once it is enslaved by anti-people elements, it will inevitably embark on the road of "using difficulty to hide shallowness," with the intention of not letting people understand. Therefore, we can say that encouraging literary writing aimed at workers, peasants and soldiers or at children and young people is precisely to remove the poison from literature and art itself, and to improve literature and art itself, that is to say, in this direction can true literary works be produced.

    The Chinese characters currently in use in our country are relatively difficult to master. Chinese characters will be reformed in the future and take the path of pinyinization. What kind of method should be adopted for pinyinization is still under research, and some scholars are working hard to complete this solemn task. But before Chinese characters are pinyinized, I think our articles must first take the path of writing as we speak. Articles should not be so pretentious and divorced from language, and should be as close as possible to writing what is said. Old classical Chinese goes without saying, new classical Chinese since the May Fourth Movement goes without saying, and recent theoretical texts and literary works obviously have a tendency towards new new classical Chinese. The main concern is probably still the Chinese characters are to blame. When using Chinese characters to express, people always want to write fewer words to improve efficiency, so they inevitably and unconsciously become divorced from the language. Today, encouraging writing aimed at workers, peasants and soldiers or young people is also encouraging us to write as we speak, reduce the use of uncommon Chinese characters, and make articles and language closer and closer, and achieve consistency between spoken and written language, which will undoubtedly reduce many difficulties in the reform of Chinese characters.

    I hope that our writers and publishers will pay more attention to these aspects. At present, please produce more children's literature works and print a large number of relatively excellent works. This is relatively easy to do as an auxiliary tool for children's education, and the effect is so great, why are we unwilling to let go and do it? If this work is done well, other auxiliary tools can also be stimulated and learned from, and it will be easy to develop after the conditions are met. Today, we are carrying out all our work under the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. If the work of one country is done well, through cultural exchanges, it will inevitably affect other countries and all mankind.

    Country after country, generation after generation, for the health of fresh life, for the development of the nation and the ethnic group, for the progress of human society, we must steadily pass the banner of patriotism and internationalism into the hands of children and young people, and pass it on forever.

    爱护新鲜的生命
    郭沫若
    少年儿童是人类的新鲜的生命，是国家建设最可宝贵的原动力。人类能够进步，国家民族能够发展，全要靠今天的少年儿童，和今后世世代代的少年儿童。拿我们中国来说，我们要使我们的国家在完成新民主主义建设的任务之后，迅速地发展社会主义建设和共产主义建设，也就全要靠今天的和今后的少年儿童的力量。
    因此，怎样来爱护我们的民族生命，怎样来培养我们的创造的原动力，实在是有关国家建设与人类进步的一个基本问题。我们总得把我们的生命力壮健起来，使我们今天的和今后的少年儿童尽可能地能够每一个人都有高尚的情操、健康的身体、创造的智慧，人人都成为对于国家、对于人类都能有贡献的爱劳动、能创造的人民英雄。
    要达到这个目的应该做的事情很多，每一个人都有份，每时每刻都有工作可做。高度发挥我们的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，把我们国家的建设事业做好，把破坏和平建设事业的危机消除，那就可以使今天的和今后的少年儿童得到安全的保障，使他们顺畅地无灾无难地成长、发育，把爱国主义与国际主义的旗帜接过手来，又传到下一代去。
    但专就儿童工作来说，我们应该做的工作也很多。儿童从在娘胎里便得受到很好的照顾，古时候有所谓“胎教”，今天从科学的观点上看来，也还是值得重视的。托儿所希望能够办得多而且好，还要我们费很大的努力。我们国家的教育体系是以幼儿教育为基础的。自中华人民共和国成立以来，我们在教育行政方面便十分重视幼儿教育和初等教育。我们在学制上、在课程上都有了很大的改进，使学校的数目和学生的数目激剧地增加了。特别是工农子女和少数民族的子女都增加了入学的机会。我们现在正在努力争取，在十年之内使全国小学教育普及，使全国不再有一个失学的儿童。
    在正规的儿童教育之外的辅助工具，在今天说来，一般都还在萌芽状态。儿童读物和儿童画报之类，和中国儿童数目比较起来，是少得可怜的。为少年儿童所欢迎的“中国少年报”创刊号只印了七万份，六七个月之间，目前已经增加到了四十八万份，整整六倍多。这证明少年儿童对于课外读物需要是怎样的迫切。但中国有几千万的少年儿童，却仅仅有这四十八万份少年报，接触面的依然狭隘，不是值得我们特别注意的吗？在今天我们还没有以儿童为对象的电影片和幻灯片。我们应该说，中国儿童的精神上的粮荒依然还没有很好地解决。
    新中国成立还仅仅两年八个月，我们在建设上的成就一般地说来已经是很惊人的了，不足三年的成就已抵得上以往的三千年。但因为我们国家大、人口多、在反动统治之下沉顿得太久，要抢救落后、恢复创伤实在是要费很大的功夫，在仅仅的两年半多点的期间企图百废毕举是不可能的。再隔十年八年，我们有保证把中国造成为像苏联一样的少年儿童的乐园。有许多工作需要有一定的物质基础，例如学校数目和教师数目的增加、儿童文化宫的设立乃至儿童电影片和幻灯片的大量生产，都是一时火迫不出来的。但今天我要向我们的文学家们、画家们呼吁——为抢救中国儿童的精神粮荒而呼吁：请你们为中国儿童多多产生些儿童文学和儿童美术作品吧！更大量地产生些更好的儿童读物和儿童画报之类，我觉得我们目前是有了这样的物质基础的，只是我们的作家们还没有十分注意到这项工作的重要。
    好的儿童文学不仅是辅助儿童教育的绝好的工具，而且可以教育成年人；对于目前扫除文盲的工作尤其可以收到一举两得之效。扫除文盲是以工农兵为对象，专门以工农兵为对象的作品不能完全适用于儿童；但如以儿童为对象的作品则能同时适用于工农兵。故在今天为少年儿童而写作，是不违背文艺主要以工农兵为对象的原则的。
    和平的敌人就是儿童的敌人。今天侵略阵营的领导者美国正利用文学、艺术、电影、广播、书刊、玩具等一切的工具把少年儿童从小时便训练成为杀人犯，在美国的所谓文艺作品的影响之下，美国少年儿童的犯罪行为在逐渐增加。这影响更波及到了受美国控制的国家。例如日本的少年儿童罪犯在一九四五年为二万八千名，但在美国管制下，到一九四八年已经增加到七万五千名了。我们不仅有责任教育我们的儿童，也有责任救济在和平敌人的影响之下的儿童。好的儿童文艺，我相信是有这种力量的，我们应该善于利用儿童文艺这种形式，来尽到教育人类、保卫和平的责任。
    文艺是应该以平易近人的形式表达道德性与艺术性同样高度的内容为最高理想的。以工农兵为对象的文艺必须平易近人，以少年儿童为对象的文艺尤必须平易近人。表现平易，使工农兵或少年儿童能够受到深刻的教育——新民主主义或社会主义的教育，那便是我们所理想的“深入浅出”的最高实践，也是我们所反对的“以艰深文浅陋”的具体反对，好的文艺没有不是平易近人、纯真朴素的，文艺一脱离了人民，一受到反人民者奴役，便必然走上“以艰深文浅陋”的道路，存心不让人懂。因此，我们可以说，鼓励以工农兵为对象或以少年儿童为对象的文艺写作，正是解除文艺本身的污毒，使文艺本身得到改进，也就是说在这样的方向中才可以产生得出真正的文艺作品。
    我们中国现行的汉字是比较难于驾御的工具，汉字将来是会改革的，并采取拼音化的道路，该采取怎样的方式来拼音化，目前还在研究的途中，好些学者们也正在为这个庄严任务的完成而努力，但在汉字采取拼音化之前，我认为我们的文章必须先走上写话的道路。文章不要那么文绉绉地和语言脱离，要尽可能地做到说什么写什么的程度。旧文言文固不用说，“五四”以来的新文言也不用说，近来的理论文字和文艺作品又显然有新新文言的倾向了。主要恐怕依然是汉字在作怪，用汉字来表达，总想少写几个字以求效率的提高，因而有意无意之间便不免和语言脱离了。在今天鼓励以工农兵或少年为对象而写作，也就是鼓励我们写话，减少不常用的汉字的使用，使文章和语言愈见接近起来，做到言文一致，对于汉字改革毫无疑问是会减少许多困难的。
    我希望我们的作家和出版工作者多多注意到这些方面上来。在目前请多多产生些儿童文学作品，并把比较优秀的作品大量印行。这在作为儿童教育辅助工具上是比较容易做的事，而效用又有这样的大，我们为什么不肯放手做呢？这件工作如果做得好，别的辅助工具也就可以受到刺激，得到借鉴，在条件具备之后便容易发展起来。我们今天是在爱国主义与国际主义的精神之下进行一切的工作的，一国的工作做得好，经过文化的交流，必然影响到别国，影响到全人类。
    一国接一国，一代接一代，为了新鲜生命的健康，为了国家民族的发展，为了人类社会的进步，我们要把爱国主义与国际主义的旗帜稳当地传递给少年儿童的手里，并永远传递下去。
