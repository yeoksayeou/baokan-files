Beijing's health and epidemic prevention campaign has now become a mass patriotic movement. The result of this movement has not only greatly improved environmental sanitation, ensured the health of residents, and given a powerful counterattack to the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors, but also enabled the vast number of residents in Beijing to initially establish a new atmosphere of hygiene in every household and cleanliness for everyone.

The movement began on March 16. In the first phase of one month, the main focus was on improving environmental sanitation. More than 90% of the city's residents participated in the general cleaning. In eighteen days, the urban area cleared 64,657 cubic meters of garbage, blocked 347,938 rat holes, blocked 32,780 tree holes, dredged 12,900 meters of open ditches, dug out 5,033 rainwater pits, and harvested 530,000 cubic meters of aquatic plants.

This movement was closely linked to the anti-bacteriological warfare campaign. The masses, who had been tempered by the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, especially the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, were widely mobilized to respond to the call and join the movement. Jiang Yushu, a representative of Fengtai Town, led the masses to clear more than 30 tons of garbage that had been accumulated for more than 20 years and filled in the sewage ditches that had been there for many years. Zhao Fulan, a woman from Mentougou, mobilized 14 women to clear more than 9,000 catties of garbage in six hours. In one day, Beixin'an Town mobilized 1,747 people and 177 carts to transport the slag from the steel plant to fill the streets. The masses in the Fourth District organized service teams to clean up for the families of military personnel. The female workers of the New Beijing Printing Factory in the Fifth District established mutual aid groups, with female workers dismantling and washing bedding for male workers... Some "dead corners" where sanitation work had always lagged behind were also broken through in the movement: the "Xu Zhuangyuan Mansion" in Suzhou Hutong in the First District had not been cleaned for more than 40 years, with accumulated dust and weeds growing everywhere; the hostess initially cherished these "ancestral legacies" and did not allow others to touch them; after repeated mobilization, it was cleaned for about a month, and now it has a completely new look.

Currently, Beijing's patriotic health and epidemic prevention campaign is entering a climax of eradicating pests—rats, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and lice. As of May 14, the city had eliminated 17.89 million fly pupae and 3.5 million flies. The masses in Fengtai Town dug out 184 catties of fly pupae in a few days, including 30 catties dug out by Zhao Yufeng's group in two days. An eight-year-old child in Liang Gong'an in the Sixteenth District killed more than 14,000 flies in three days. Rats are an even more important target for search and encirclement. Various districts have formulated rat-catching plans, and the city has now captured more than 190,000 rats. The Fifteenth Branch of the Third District broadcasts every night with a loudspeaker: "It's getting late, folks, prepare your rat-catching tools." The rat-catching team then sets out to provide guidance.

Now, hundreds of hutongs in Beijing have been paved with pebbles or flattened with soil, and are carefully protected by tens of thousands of residents' health groups. From the streets into the organs, factories, schools, shops, households, and large courtyards, people see clean courtyards, clean and tidy offices, workrooms, workshops, classrooms, living rooms, and bedrooms everywhere. There are few "storage rooms" with accumulated dust or greasy kitchens. Doors and windows are open, letting in the early summer breeze and sunlight. Lime is sprinkled on the damp ground, and wooden lids are placed on earthen baskets, water tanks, and toilets. In the vegetable market, glass and wire mesh covers have been added to meat and fish stalls. The tables of snack stalls are wiped clean, and many food stall owners and waiters wear white aprons, white sleeves, and white hats. The sauce gardens that used to emit a musty smell are no longer a paradise for flies. Rows of sauce jars are covered with white gauze covers, and the ground is also cleaned very cleanly. Manure yards and slaughterhouses that hindered hygiene have also been relocated.

How is Beijing's health and epidemic prevention campaign organized and led?

First, concentrate forces, break through the most difficult links, and promote the entire movement. In the past, the hygiene work in Beijing was done the worst by the organs: the organization was unsound, the cadres did not pay attention to it, and the leadership was not unified, so it was far behind the hygiene of the residents. At the beginning of this movement, this situation was vigorously reversed first. The health organizations of the organs were led by the leaders themselves. For example, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government served as the Director of the Health Organization of the Ministry of Railways; the Secretary-General of the Central Financial and Economic Commission personally inspected the health work. The health organizations at all levels of the organs are uniformly under the leadership of the local health committee. In this way, the health work of many organs was improved first, and the overall health movement was relatively easily launched.

Second, the propaganda work of the health movement, on the one hand, was combined with the propaganda against bacteriological warfare, which stimulated the masses' anti-American sentiment; on the other hand, it was combined with the propaganda of building the people's motherland, so that the broad masses of the people realized that doing a good job in hygiene was a major event related to national construction, thus promoting the spirit of patriotism and turning the health movement into a patriotic movement. In terms of publicity methods, various districts generally adopted exhibitions. The exhibitions are equipped with microscopes and other physical models, and the masses can observe the truth about pests and bacteria through microscopes, which greatly improves their vigilance against pests and bacteria and strengthens their determination to fight against pests and bacteria. The Seventh District once organized a mobile exhibition, taking the clothes damaged by rats, pictures of plague, and rat-catching tools to various sections for publicity. The Third District also held an exhibition to eliminate the "Five Poisons" and exchange rat-catching experiences.

Third, timely, universal, and in-depth organization of inspections is an important part of the movement's success. The leading institutions of Beijing's health work conducted three major inspections in two months. Through inspections, good units are commended, bad units are criticized, and the movement is promoted to move forward continuously. The inspection methods are diverse: there are mutual inspections between households, mutual inspections between groups, as well as universal mutual inspections or rotation inspections between police station branches, industries, districts, and between organs, factories, and schools; there are top-down inspections or spot checks by the city and districts on branches and groups; there are bottom-up inspections by groups on branches and branches on districts. Many districts have established a regular inspection system, which is led by the group leader.

Fourth, during the movement, the health organizations at all levels of the city, districts, police stations, and groups are constantly rectified and improved, and epidemic prevention and health work are included in the patriotic pact, or a special patriotic health pact is formulated to ensure that health work becomes regular work. The health organizations in most districts of Beijing have been expanded, reorganized, and absorbed representatives from all walks of life in the region to participate. Some districts' health groups have implemented a section responsibility system to ensure that indoor and outdoor cleaning is carried out every day. Many hutongs and large courtyards have established a rotating duty system. After all households in Changxindian signed the patriotic health pact, they launched a town-wide challenge competition to ensure that health work would not be interrupted.

Although Beijing's health and epidemic prevention campaign has achieved the above results, its development is still uneven, some organs and units still do not pay enough attention to it, and the sanitation of the catering industry still needs to be further improved. Especially since summer has begun, the health movement needs to be further consolidated and deepened.

    北京市开展爱国防疫卫生工作的经验
    金凤
    北京市的卫生防疫运动，现在已经形成了群众性的爱国运动。这一运动的结果，不仅大大改善了环境卫生，使居民的健康有了保证，给美国侵略者的细菌战以有力的回击，而且使北京市广大居民初步树立了家家讲卫生、人人爱清洁的新风气。
    运动是从三月十六日开始的。第一阶段的一个月中，主要是搞好环境卫生。全市百分之九十以上的居民参加了大扫除。在十八天中，城区清除了垃圾六万四千六百五十七土方，堵塞耗子洞三十四万七千九百三十八个，堵塞树洞三万二千七百八十个，疏浚明沟一万二千九百公尺，挖掏雨水坑五千零三十三片，捞割水草五十三万方公尺。
    这一运动是紧密结合反细菌战进行的。经过了抗美援朝、特别是“三反”、“五反”运动锻炼的群众，广泛地被动员起来，响应号召，投入运动。丰台镇代表姜玉书，带领群众把积存二十多年的垃圾三十多吨清除了，把多年的污水沟填平了。门头沟妇女赵福兰动员妇女十四人，在六小时内，清除垃圾九千多斤。北辛安镇在一天内发动群众一千七百四十七人，大车一百七十七辆，运出钢铁厂的炉渣来填平街道。四区群众组织了服务队替军属打扫卫生。五区新北京印刷厂成立互助组，女工替男工拆洗被褥……。一些卫生工作一向落后的“死角”，也在运动中突破了：一区苏州胡同的“徐状元府”四十多年没有打扫，尘土集积，野草丛生；女主人最初还珍惜这些“祖上遗产”，不许别人去动；经过反复动员，打扫了一个月左右，现在也面目一新了。
    目前，北京市爱国卫生防疫运动正进入扑灭病害虫——老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、蚤、虱的高潮。到五月十四日为止，全市已消灭蛹蝇一千七百八十九万只，灭蝇三百五十万只。丰台镇群众几天内挖出蝇蛹一百八十四斤，其中赵玉凤小组两天就挖了三十斤。十六区梁公庵一个八岁的小孩，三天内灭蝇一万四千多个。老鼠更是搜捕围剿的重要对象。各区纷纷制订捕鼠计划，全市现在已捕鼠十九万多只。三区十五分会每晚有人拿喇叭筒广播：“天晚了，老乡们把捉耗子工具准备好。”捕鼠队接着就出动指导。
    现在，北京有几百条胡同已经用石子铺好，或用泥土压得很平，并由上万个居民卫生小组小心地保护着。从街道走进机关、工厂、学校、商店、住户和大杂院，人们到处看到的是清洁的庭院，干净整齐的办公室、工作房、车间、教室、客厅和卧室。很少看到尘土堆积的“储藏间”或肮脏油腻的厨房。门窗敞开着，透进初夏的和风和阳光。石灰洒在潮湿的土地上，木盖盖在土筐、水缸和厕所上。在菜市场，肉案和鱼摊加上了玻璃罩和铁纱罩。小吃摊的桌面擦洗得很干净，许多食品摊的主人和伙计围上了白围裙，带上了白围袖和白帽子。过去散发着霉气的酱园，不再是苍蝇的乐园。一排排的酱缸罩着白纱罩，地上也打扫得很洁净。有碍卫生的粪场、屠宰场也迁移了。
    北京市的卫生防疫运动是怎样组织和领导的呢？
    第一，集中力量，突破最困难的环节，以推动整个运动。北京的卫生工作，过去以机关做得最差：组织不健全、干部不重视、领导不统一，以致远远落后于居民卫生。此次运动开始，即首先大力扭转这一情况。各机关的卫生组织，由首长亲自领导。如中央人民政府铁道部副部长担任铁道部卫生组织的主任委员；中央财经委员会秘书长亲自检查卫生工作。各级机关卫生组织，统一受当地区卫生委员会的领导。这样，许多机关的卫生工作首先改善了，全面的卫生运动也就比较容易地发动了起来。
    第二，卫生运动的宣传工作，一方面结合了反细菌战的宣传，激励了群众的仇美情绪；一方面结合了建设人民祖国的宣传，使广大群众认识到做好卫生工作是有关国家建设的大事，因而发扬了爱国主义精神，使卫生运动变成了爱国运动。宣传方式上，各区普遍采用了展览会。展览会备有显微镜及其他实物模型，群众可以通过显微镜观察害虫细菌的真相，大大提高了对害虫细菌的警惕，提高了与害虫细菌作斗争的决心。七区曾组织巡回展览，拿被老鼠损坏了的衣物、鼠疫的图片和捕鼠工具到各地段进行宣传。三区并举行扑灭“五毒”展览会，交流捕鼠经验。
    第三，及时、普遍深入地组织检查，是运动取得成绩的重要一环。北京市卫生工作领导机构，在两个月中进行大检查三次。通过检查，表扬好的单位，批评不好的单位，推动运动不断向前发展。检查的方式是多种多样的：有户与户的相互检查，有小组与小组的相互检查，也有派出所分会与分会、行业与行业，区与区以及机关、工厂、学校的普遍相互检查或轮流检查；有市、区对分会、小组的自上而下的检查或抽查；有小组对分会、分会对区的自下而上的检查。许多区建立了经常性的检查制度，由小组长负责领导。
    第四，运动中，不断地整顿与健全市、区、派出所、小组等各级卫生组织，并将防疫卫生工作订入爱国公约，或专门订立爱国卫生公约，保证卫生工作变成经常工作。北京大部分区的卫生组织，已经扩大、改组，吸收本地区各界代表人物参加。有些区的卫生小组实行了地段负责制，保证每天进行户内外的清洁扫除。许多胡同和大杂院建立了轮流值日制度。长辛店在各户都订立了爱国卫生公约之后，并展开全镇的挑战竞赛，以保证卫生工作不致中断。
    北京市卫生防疫运动虽然有了以上成绩，但发展仍不平衡，某些机关单位仍然不够重视，饮食业卫生情况还须继续改进。尤其夏季已经开始，卫生运动更须进一步的巩固与深入。
