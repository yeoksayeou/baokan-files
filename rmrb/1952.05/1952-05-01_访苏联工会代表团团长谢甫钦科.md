　　Interview with Comrade Shevchenko, Head of the Soviet Trade Union Delegation

　　The Soviet Trade Union Delegation came to participate in the "May Day" Labor Day celebrations, bringing with them the love of the entire Soviet working people for the new China. Comrade Shevchenko, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, said: "The Chinese and Soviet people are friends and brothers, and I am willing to answer your questions as much as possible." Comrade Gureyev, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Soviet Machine Manufacturing Workers' Union, also enthusiastically provided information to answer the questions.

　　"The world knows that the peaceful labor of the Soviet people is amazing. This is mainly reflected in the rapid recovery of the national economy after the Patriotic War. The post-war five-year plan has been successfully completed and exceeded: agriculture, metallurgy, coal, and iron have all overfulfilled or completed the plan ahead of schedule."

　　The rise of industry, agriculture, and transportation is due to the further improvement of labor organization. Compared with last year and the year before, the labor productivity of industrial workers has increased by 10 percent, and the income of workers and staff has also increased proportionally. National income has increased by 12 percent. The Soviet working people do not work for parasitic classes, but to improve the national economy. Therefore, they are constantly seeking new forms of labor, demanding to be stronger today than yesterday. The labor form they created is to organize socialist labor competitions in order to complete production standards and quotas. Every factory, every workshop, and every individual participates in the competition, which guarantees the successful completion of the state plan.

　　He said: We not only compete in quantity, but also in quality.

　　Not only do we compete in quantity and quality, but also in saving raw materials and power, using the saved raw materials and power to make additional finished products.

　　Just like Zhang Darova and Agafonova, two female lathe operators from the Moscow Kaganovich Factory who have been widely publicized, they initiated the "Complete Every Operation Excellently" movement. Their call has spread throughout the Soviet Union and abroad.

　　The Stalin Automobile Factory launched a competition to save metal, saving raw materials in every operation. The raw materials used should be lower than the original figures, and the finished products should only be made better. Shevchenko picked up the fruit knife on the table and said: If this knife originally used 200 grams of raw materials, then now we must strive to use 170 or 180 grams of raw materials.

　　Why can Soviet workers solve these problems so smoothly?

　　This is because the workers' culture has improved, and the workers and technicians cooperate closely. When innovators have suggestions, professors and academicians study them together from a scientific point of view. This solves the workers' problems. The workers' experience plus science has greatly improved the workers' culture.

　　This gradually eliminates the boundary between physical and mental labor.

　　Last year, thanks to the cooperation between workers and technicians, 500 unprecedented machines and parts were created.

　　Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Stalin, the trade union organizes workers to complete work, engage in competitions, hold welfare activities, and improve organization.

　　Due to the development of production, the Soviet working people also have the possibility of further improving their lives and increasing their real wages. This year's fifth price reduction after the war will benefit the Soviet people by 2.8 billion rubles annually. The reduction rate ranges from 10 to 30 percent. Not only are daily necessities reduced in price, but also textbooks are greatly reduced in price.

　　Last year, the Soviet Union built millions of square meters of housing, many clubs and cultural facilities, opened 5,000 new primary and secondary schools, and increased the number of students by 2.5 million. The Soviet working people intimately feel the care of the government, the Party, and Comrade Stalin. They are determined to complete this year's communist construction projects with greater enthusiasm as a response.

　　For example, the Turkmen Main Canal, the Volga-Don Canal, and the South Ukraine and North Crimea Canal. Flourishing and beautiful gardens have appeared on the vast grasslands and dry land. There are hydroelectric power stations everywhere, and the two hydroelectric power stations in Kuibyshev and Stalingrad are the largest.

　　These are called communist construction projects. These projects can be completed soon and put into use. The Volga-Don Canal will be open to navigation this year, and Moscow will become a port of five seas: the White Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Baltic Sea.

　　"Has anyone been to Moscow? It will be very different if you go again this year!" Shevchenko twirled the Zhonghua brand cigarette that we used to entertain guests and joked with a smile: "This year you can take a boat from Moscow and travel anywhere. All five sea routes are open. You can also take a boat from China to Moscow."

　　A secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions may not be a children's literature writer, but he told an excellent fairy tale that adults were also fascinated by, a realistic, joyful fairy tale belonging to the category of communism.

　　After telling this exciting fairy tale, Shevchenko immediately turned the topic to the issue of defending world peace. Because the Soviet working people know that all labor achievements can only be maintained in peace. War is only beneficial to capitalists, but only brings disasters to the working people. The Soviet government has always adhered to a peaceful policy, and together with other peace-loving countries, it prevents new wars, exposes the conspiracies of war instigators led by American and British capitalist countries, and advocates peaceful solutions to international problems. The Soviet people actively participate in the struggle to defend peace at home and abroad. They clearly know that the working people in capitalist countries also hope for peace. The Soviet people support this desire and join the people of the world in opposing the man-eating savages who instigate war.

　　He said that the Soviet people hate the American aggressors who launched the Korean War. The Soviet people were very excited that the Chinese and Korean People's forces drove the American aggressors to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. They are concerned about the heroic deeds of the Chinese people and are willing to do everything possible to help China restore and develop its national economy. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is an invincible force in the world.

　　At the end of this issue, Shevchenko spoke of Chairman Mao Zedong in an incomparably gentle tone. He attributed the gratifying achievements made by the new China in a short period of time to Mao Zedong's leadership.

　　Shevchenko is very familiar with our "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. He pointed out that because the Soviet people have also waged a relentless struggle against corruption, waste, and theft in the process of construction, they have a deep understanding of this movement. This is a problem that must be solved in national development.

　　On April 29, the Soviet Trade Union Delegation visited the Summer Palace. Shevchenko and the members of the delegation recognized the high cultural creation of the Chinese working people hundreds of years ago. The builders at that time worked hard, but did not enjoy the fruits of their labor. Most of these excellent buildings have now returned to the hands of the people. "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have given play to their cultural and artistic talents and developed welfare undertakings, such as sanatoriums, cultural palaces, and medical institutions, to improve the culture and health of the working people!" Shevchenko said once again that the improvement of people's lives is due to everyone uniting around Chairman Mao.

　　On the evening of April 28, the delegates watched the documentary "Happy Xinjiang". Shevchenko familiarly talked about some Chinese films he had seen in the Soviet Union: "You must know that not only Comrade Gureyev and I sitting here, but all the audience in the Soviet Union, they warmly applaud your artistic achievements and the content of the struggle." He is also as familiar with our published foreign language books and the achievements of labor heroes as if he were counting his family treasures.

　　The labor heroes in the delegation also plan to demonstrate their advanced technologies in some cities in China. Busuyev, who completed the production quota for 27 years after the war using high-speed cutting methods, brought his tools to China and wanted to convey his experience to Chinese workers at any time. His machine tool has reached 2,650 meters of cutting per minute.

　　The Soviet working people have overfulfilled the production quota for the first quarter of this year in all aspects, and they have created the specific conditions for this year's May Day labor competition. They are working under the slogan "Under the banner of Lenin, under the leadership of Stalin, march towards the victory of communism!"

### 访苏联工会代表团团长谢甫钦科

　　访苏联工会代表团团长谢甫钦科
    苏联工会代表团带了全苏劳动人民对新中国的热爱来参加“五一”劳动节观礼。团长谢甫钦科是全苏工会中央理事会书记，他说：“中苏人民是朋友，是兄弟，我愿意尽可能回答你们提出的问题。”古列也夫、苏联机器制造业工人工会中央委员会主席，也热心地供给回答问题的资料。
    “举世知道苏联人民从事的和平劳动是惊人的。这主要表现在卫国战争以后国民经济恢复得那样快，战后五年计划已经胜利完成，而且超过了：农业、冶金、煤、铁都超额或提前完成了计划。”
    工业、农业、运输业的上升，是由于劳动组织进一步改善了。去年和前年相较，工业工人劳动生产率增加了百分之十，职工收入也在成正比例地增加着，国民收入增加了百分之十二。苏联劳动人民不是为了寄生的阶级而劳动，而是为了改善国民经济而劳动，因此，每天都在寻求新的劳动形式，要求今天能够强于昨天。他们创造的劳动形式就是组织社会主义劳动竞赛，以便完成生产标准和定额。每个工厂、每个车间、每个人都参加竞赛，这就保证了国家计划的圆满完成。
    他说：我们不只竞赛数量，而且也竞赛质量。
    不只作数量、质量的竞赛，而且作节约生产原料和动力的竞赛，用节约的原料和动力，作额外的成品。
    正如久已传扬的莫斯科卡冈诺维奇工厂的两位女旋工张达罗娃和阿加芬诺娃，她们发起了“优等地完成每一个操作”运动，她们的号召普及全苏联，而且传播到国外。
    斯大林汽车工厂发起节约金属的竞赛，在每个操作上节约加工原料。使用的原料要比原定的数字降低，而成品只许作得更好。谢甫钦科随手拿起桌上的水果刀说：如果这把刀原来用二百克的原料作成，那么如今就要争取用一百七八十克原料。
    为什么苏联工人能够这么顺利地解决这些问题呢？
    这是因为，工人的文化提高了，工人和技术人员亲密合作起来了。革新者有了建议，教授和院士们一同用科学观点加以研究。这样就解决了工人的问题。工人的经验加上科学，工人文化也进步多了。
    这样就使得体力和脑力劳动的界限逐渐消失了。
    去年由于工人和技术人员之间的合作，创造了五百种前所未有的机器和机件。
    工会是在党和斯大林同志的领导下组织工人完成工作、从事竞赛、举办福利、改善组织的。
    由于生产的发展，苏联劳动人民也就有了进一步改善生活、增加实际工资的可能。今年的战后第五次减低物价，使得苏联人民每年得益二十八亿卢布。减低率从百分之十到三十，不只日用品减价，教科书也减价很多。
    去年苏联建造了几百万平方米的住宅、许多俱乐部和文化生活的设施，开办了五千个新的中小学，增加了二百五十万学生。苏联的劳动人民亲切地感觉到政府、党和斯大林同志的关怀，他们决心以更大的热情完成今年的共产主义建设工程，作为回答。
    例如土库曼大运河、伏尔加河—顿河运河、以及南乌克兰和北克里米亚运河。在辽阔的草原、在干燥的土地上，出现了繁荣美丽的花园。到处是水电站，古比雪夫和斯大林格勒的两个水电站是最大的。
    这些，就被称为共产主义建设工程。这些工程不久可以完成，而且开始加以使用。伏尔加河—顿河运河今年就要开航，以后莫斯科就会成为五个海的港口：白海，里海，黑海，亚速海和波罗的海。
    “有谁到过莫斯科么？今年再去可就大大不同了！”谢甫钦科捻着我们待客的中华牌纸烟，笑呵呵地打趣说：“今年可以从莫斯科坐船任意出游了，五个海路路通。从中国也可以坐了轮船到达莫斯科。”
    一位全苏工会中央理事会的书记也许不是一个儿童文学的作家，但他却说了一个出色的、成人听了也出神的童话，一个现实的、欢乐的、属于共产主义范畴的童话。
    说了这个叫人激动的童话之后，谢甫钦科马上把话题转到保卫世界和平的问题。因为苏联劳动人民知道，一切劳动成果在和平的情况下才能保持。战争只对资本家有利，对劳动人民却只有灾难。苏联政府一向坚持和平政策，和其它爱好和平的国家一同防止新战争，揭穿以美英资本主义国家为首的战争挑拨者的阴谋，主张以和平方式解决国际间的问题。苏联人民在国内国外积极参加保卫和平的斗争。他们清楚地知道：资本主义国家的劳动人民也是希望和平的。苏联人民支持这个意愿，和全世界人民一同反对挑拨战争的吃人的生番。
    他说，苏联人民痛恨发动朝鲜战争的美国侵略者。中朝人民部队把美国侵略者赶到三八线附近，苏联人民十分兴奋。他们关心地注视中国人民的英雄事迹，愿意尽一切可能帮助中国恢复和发展国民经济。中苏人民的友谊是世界上不可战胜的力量。
    在结束这个问题的时候，谢甫钦科以无比柔和的声调谈起了毛泽东主席，他把新中国在短短的时期内获得的可喜的成就归因于毛泽东的领导。
    谢甫钦科很熟悉我们的“三反”、“五反”运动。他指出，正因为苏联人民在建设过程中也和贪污浪费和盗窃现象进行过无情的斗争，所以对这个运动有深切的体会。这是在国家发展中必须解决的问题。
    四月二十九日，苏联工会代表团游过颐和园。谢甫钦科和团员们认识了几百年前中国劳动人民的高度文化的创造，当时的建造者胼手胝足地辛勤劳动，但是没有享受到劳动的成果。这一大部分优秀建筑，现在已重回人民之手了。“中华人民共和国成立不久，中国人民已经发挥了自己的文化艺术方面的才能，发展了福利事业，如休养所、文化宫、医疗机构，来提高劳动人民的文化和健康！”谢甫钦科又一次说，人民生活的改善，是由于大家团结在毛主席周围的缘故。
    四月二十八日晚间，代表们看了纪录片《欢乐的新疆》。谢甫钦科熟稔地说起在苏联看过的一些中国影片：“要知道，不只是在座的古列也夫和我，而是苏联的所有的观众，他们为你们的艺术成就及其斗争的内容热烈鼓掌。”他对我们出版的外文书刊和劳动英雄们的业绩也是如数家珍似地熟悉。
    团员中的劳动英雄们还打算在中国的一些城市中表演他们的先进技术。用高速切削法在战后完成了二十七年的生产定额的布苏也夫带了他的工具到中国来，想随时给中国的工人同志们传达经验。他的机床每分钟已作到切削二千六百五十公尺。
    苏联的劳动人民在各方面已经超额完成了今年第一季的生产定额，他们已创造了今年五一劳动竞赛的具体条件。他们正在“在列宁的旗帜下，在斯大林的领导下，向共产主义的胜利迈进！”这样的口号下劳动着。
