Review of the GDR Film "Daily Bread"
He Luo

"Daily Bread" is the first film from the German Democratic Republic to be screened in our country, and also the first film from a people's democratic country to be translated and distributed in our country. Following this, many excellent films from various people's democratic countries will be meeting with Chinese audiences one after another. The screening of "Daily Bread" marks the beginning of a further strengthening of cultural exchanges between our country and various people's democratic countries.

"Daily Bread" won the German National Prize and is a major achievement in German film art. The film reflects the early days of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic in 1946. At that time, the war caused by Hitler left Germany riddled with holes. Most of the factories and residences were destroyed by American aircraft during the war. People had no clothes to wear, no food to eat, and no coal to burn. In particular, the general urban civilians, in the face of hunger and cold, could not help but worry about their daily bread. They took shirts, sheets, and the like to the countryside in large numbers to exchange for bread with the farmers, and then returned to the cities on overcrowded trains to get through those difficult days. What to do? The question was raised in the family of Karl Weibers, an unemployed accountant. There were two answers: one was represented by Weibers' thinking, who had a strong bourgeois ideology and believed that there could be no production without capital; he opposed the "foolish" act of repairing factories on an empty stomach, and pinned his hopes on the capitalists. He believed that doing business was better than anything else, and in tune with him was his second son, Helli, who engaged in black market speculation. But his eldest son—the worker Aiers—put forward another answer, he believed in the future of the proletariat and had infinite hope for the construction of the motherland. He believed that the factories could be built with the strength of the working people. Following him was his sister, Inge, who had improved her understanding from her own experience. Let's take a look at their dialogue:

	Hai: "What are you working so hard for in these unprofitable jobs?"
	Karl: (sarcastically) "For everyone."
	Aier: "That's right, it's for everyone."
	Hai: "For everyone? I'm for myself."
	Aier: "I really don't understand, during the Hitler era, you helped him, but now it's the people's country, and you stand by and watch."
	Karl: "Do you know why?"
	Aier: "Because you still miss the old society."
	Karl: "You think you can build a new one, I think you're going to destroy the good things of the past."
	Hai: "That's right."
	Aier: "No, we want to build a people's country, a people's factory, even without you, we can build it."

Obviously, there are two thoughts and two paths here, namely the thought of individualism and the thought of collectivism, the road of capitalism and the road of people's democracy. The film unfolds a fierce struggle between these contradictions. We see that the black market is cracked down, and the profiteers fail; Helli commits suicide in shame for robbing his father's bread; Karl Weibers' dream as a bourgeois tail is also shattered, and he begins to lean towards the working class and rejoin the work. At the same time, we also see the construction confidence and heroism of the German working class. When the smoke of the city and the countryside had not yet dissipated, they bravely threw themselves into the construction work. Hunger and cold did not subdue them; difficulties did not scare them away; they did not care about remuneration at all, and went to those piles of rubble to carry out construction work. They restored factories and transportation in a pragmatic, step-by-step and planned manner. No matter how Weibers and others despised and ridiculed them, and no matter how individual elements within the workers doubted and wavered, they initially made small pots for daily use, and finally produced tractors, solving the problems of food and raw materials, laying the foundation for the great construction cause of the motherland. This eloquently illustrates the superiority of the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and demonstrates that this system is the basic condition for ensuring the steady development of national construction and gradually moving towards socialist and communist society.

The theme of "Daily Bread" is very profound, its content is very rich; and the issues involved are acute. This film truly reflects the German people's qualities of diligence, wisdom, hard work, and determination. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they have full confidence and strength to eliminate all the material and ideological evils left over from the past, and strive for the realization of a free and happy beautiful society. Compared with the western part of Germany under the rule of American imperialism and its puppet government, this is such a sharp contrast!

In this film, the characters are portrayed very realistically and vividly. Karl Weibers and Aiers are two typical figures that form a contrast. The former is short-sighted, narrow-minded, stubborn in thought, and puts on airs, indeed like a typical petty citizen who has been麻醉ed by capitalist ideas for a long time. The latter adheres to the truth, is energetic, frank and straightforward, and hard-working, completely an image of an advanced worker who has been baptized by class struggle. Furthermore, Helli's gloom and decadence, Inge's simplicity and brightness, Niki's wit and cheerfulness, and the factory director's simplicity, composure, decisiveness, and firmness are all true portrayals of their character traits.

In the handling of the subject matter, it is also very concentrated and compact. In particular, the screenwriter and director are very good at using the technique of contrast to make the meaning of the characters and events stand out clearly. For example, the initial scene of devastation and difficult life, leading to discord among relatives and friends and unhappiness in the family, is in strong contrast with the final scene of the appearance of tractors and the cheers of people celebrating the leap forward in production, which is very impressive. Another example is the contrast between the scene of Weibers admitting defeat and joining the factory led by Aiers, and the scene of the success of the cause undertaken by Aiers and his worker brothers, and the promotion of Aiers, the contrast between Inge's happy love and Helli's death, and the contrast between the two engineers adopting two attitudes towards the people's cause due to two different experiences, all give the audience a deep impression. These contrasts are closely centered on the theme and the central clue, dividing the ideological boundaries and development prospects of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat extremely clearly, making people feel as if they have discovered road signs before a fork in the road, and can find the correct direction and path.

A good film, as Ambassador K&#246;nig, head of the diplomatic mission of the German Democratic Republic, said in the article "Daily Bread": "As a mass art, film must become a sharp and powerful weapon to combat the reactionaries and to oppose war, militarism, and strive for peace and friendship among all nations in the world for the sake of the growing and consolidating democratic cause."

"Daily Bread" has indeed fulfilled this responsibility victoriously.

    民主德国影片“每日的粮食”评介
    何洛
    “每日的粮食”是在我国放映的第一部民主德国的影片，也是人民民主国家的影片在我国翻译、发行的第一部。继此以后，将有各人民民主国家的许多优秀电影，陆续和我国观众见面。“每日的粮食”的放映乃是我国和各人民民主国家的文化交流的进一步加强的开端。
    “每日的粮食”曾荣获德国国家奖金，是德国电影艺术上的一个重大成就。影片所反映的时代是一九四六年民主德国建立的初期。那时候，由希特勒所造成的战争给德国留下了百孔千疮。多数的工厂和住宅，都在战争中被美机破坏了。人们没有衣穿，没有饭吃，没有煤烧。特别是一般城市平民，在饥寒交迫的情况下，更不能不为每天的粮食而发愁。他们大批地、不断地带着衬衫、床单之类到乡间去和农民交换面包，然后又坐着拥挤不堪的火车回到城市里来，打发那种艰难困苦的日子。怎么办？问题是在一个失业的会计员卡尔·魏伯斯的家庭里提出来了。答案有两个：一个是以魏伯斯的思想为代表，他有浓厚的资产阶级思想，认为没有资本就谈不上生产；反对空着肚子去修复工厂的“愚蠢”行为，把希望寄托在资本家的身上。他认为干一行买卖比任何事情都好，和他同调的是他的第二个儿子，作黑市投机买卖的海利。但他的大儿子——工人艾尔斯提出另一个答案，他相信无产阶级的前途，对祖国的建设事业抱着无限的希望。他认为凭着劳动人民的力量是可以把工厂修建起来的。跟随他走的有从切身经验中提高了认识的妹妹茵格。我们看一看他们的对话吧：
    海：“干这些不挣钱的工作干得这么起劲，你们是
    为什么？”
    卡：（讽刺）“为大家呗。”
    艾：“对啦，就是为大家。”
    海：“为大家？我可是为自己。”
    艾：“我真是不明白，希特勒时代，你们倒帮助
    他，现在是人民的国家，你们反而袖手旁
    观。”
    卡：“你知道这是为什么？”
    艾：“因为你们还留恋着旧社会。”
    卡：“你认为你们能建设新的，我看你们把过去
    好的东西也要破坏了。”
    海：“说得对。”
    艾：“不对，我们要建设人民的国家，人民的工
    厂，就是没有你们，我们也一样能够建设。”
    显然，在这里存在着两种思想，两条道路，就是个人主义的思想和集体主义的思想，资本主义的道路和人民民主的道路。影片中展开了这一矛盾之间的剧烈的斗争。我们看到黑市破获了，奸商失败了；海利因抢劫父亲的面包而愧悔自杀了；作为资产阶级的尾巴的卡尔·魏伯斯的迷梦也破灭了，开始靠拢工人阶级，重新参加工作。同时，我们也看到德国工人阶级的建设信心和英雄气概。当城市和乡村的烟火尚未熄灭的时候，他们便勇敢地投入了建设工作。饥寒没有制服他们；困难没有吓退他们；他们丝毫不计较报酬，走到那些堆积如山的瓦砾中去进行建设工作。他们是实事求是地、有步骤有计划地把工厂和交通恢复起来。不管魏伯斯一类人怎样蔑视，讥笑，也不管工人内部个别分子怎样怀疑，动摇，他们最初制作日用品小锅，最后生产拖拉机，解决了粮食和原料的问题，为祖国的伟大建设事业，打下了基础。这就雄辩地说明了由工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度的优越性，说明了这种制度是保证国家建设稳步发展，逐渐走向社会主义社会和共产主义社会的基本条件。
    “每日的粮食”的主题是很深刻的，它的内容是很丰富的；而所涉及的问题是尖锐的。这部片子真实地反映出德国人民的勤劳、智慧、刻苦、坚定的品质，他们在共产党和人民政府的领导下，完全有信心和力量消灭一切过去遗留下来的物质的和思想的恶果，争取自由幸福的美好社会的实现。这跟在美帝国主义及其傀儡政府的统治下的德国西部比较起来，是多么尖锐的对照！
    在这部影片中，人物刻划得很真实生动。卡尔·魏伯斯和艾尔斯是形成对比的两个典型人物。前者眼光短小，心胸狭隘，思想顽固，硬摆架子，确像一个长期在资本主义思想麻醉下的小市民的典型。后者坚持真理，精力充沛，坦白直率，刻苦耐劳，完全是一个受过阶级斗争洗礼的先进工人的形象。再如海利的阴沉、颓废，茵格的单纯、明快，尼琦的机敏、开朗，以及工厂厂长的质朴、沉着、干脆、坚定，都是他们的性格特征的真实写照。
    在题材的处理上，也很集中、紧凑。特别是编导很会运用对比的手法，使人物和事件的意义鲜明凸出。例如最初的满目疮痍，生活困苦，以致亲友失和，家庭不欢，和结尾的拖拉机的出场和人们庆祝生产飞跃前进的欢呼场面，两者的对比很强烈，给人印象很深。又如魏伯斯自认失败，投到艾尔斯所领导的工厂去工作的场面和艾尔斯及其工人弟兄们所进行的事业获得成功，艾尔斯被提拔的场面的对比，茵格的爱情美满和海利的走向死亡的对比，以及两个工程师由于两种遭遇而对人民事业采取两种态度的对比，都给观众以深刻的印象。这些对比紧紧围绕着主题思想和中心线索，把资产阶级和无产阶级的思想界限、发展前途等划分得异常明确，使人好像站在岔道之前发现了路标一样，能够找到正确的方向和道路。
    一部好的影片，正如德意志民主共和国外交使团大使衔团长柯尼希在“每日的粮食”一文中所说：“作为群众艺术的影片，必须成为打击反动派、并为着日益巩固成长中的民主事业去反对战争、反对军国主义以及争取全世界各民族间的和平和友好的尖锐而有力的武器。”
    “每日的粮食”，确是胜利地尽了这个职责的。
