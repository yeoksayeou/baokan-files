    The People of Qingdao Fight Against Bacterial Warfare
    Yang Yang
    Since March 6th, when the American aggressors expanded their heinous bacterial warfare to Qingdao, the city's people have engaged in the fight against bacterial warfare with fury. The people of the city have put forward a firm slogan: "We will not cease fighting until the enemy's bacterial flames are completely extinguished!"

    Immediately after enemy planes spread bacterial insects, the city's medical and health workers and scientists held an emergency mobilization meeting. Teachers and students from major and secondary schools, as well as workers, farmers, and neighborhood residents, held discussion forums one after another. At all meetings, people expressed with fervor that they would strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, strive to increase production and practice thrift, and better support the Chinese and Korean People's Army to punish these bacterial war criminals. At the same time, they would carry out insect extermination, rat catching, and sanitation work to completely crush the enemy's conspiracy to create plague. In order to extinguish the bacterial insects dropped by the enemy, scientific and health workers and expert professors worked tirelessly, often working in the laboratory until late at night, sometimes even forgetting to eat. Members of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Union also donated batches of their stored drugs related to epidemic prevention and disinfection, and volunteered to participate in the preparation of various insecticidal and disinfectant agents. Many private practicing doctors also participated in the fight against bacterial warfare. More than 300 members of the Qingdao Science and Technology Popularization Association, as well as teachers and students from major and secondary schools throughout the city, and various propaganda organizations, launched a campaign to publicize anti-bacterial warfare to the people of the city. They went deep into the courtyards, exposing the crimes of American imperialism to the masses, explaining epidemic prevention and hygiene knowledge, and explaining the defense methods of bacterial weapons and the specific methods of catching poisonous insects. They used objects, microscopic perspectives, posters, slides, movies, and other tools to help explain what bacteria are, the routes of germ transmission, and methods of extermination. This not only consolidated the masses' confidence in overcoming bacterial warfare, but also enabled the broad masses to master scientific methods and strengthen their defenses.

    A city-wide rat-catching and insect-extermination campaign was launched. Residents of many sections organized "insect-extermination teams" and launched red flag competitions for rat-catching and insect-extermination. Some women adopted methods such as "changing work and mutual assistance" and organizing temporary nurseries to free up most of their labor force and invest it in the fight against bacterial warfare. After significant achievements were made in the rat-catching and insect-extermination campaign, the people of the city generally launched a clean-up and sanitation campaign. Every household thoroughly cleaned from indoors to outdoors, and cleaned and tidied up clothing, bedding, and all other utensils. All the residents of the Reading Group at No. 6 Andong Road, after denouncing the bloody crimes of the American aggressors, immediately cleaned the inside and outside of the entire courtyard, and sprinkled carbolic acid water and quicklime. The residents of No. 72 and No. 77 Zhongshan Road even launched a cleanliness competition.

    During the clean-up and sanitation campaign, young people played a particularly active role. In addition to cleaning their own homes first, they also organized themselves to clean up courtyards and roads. More than 60 young people living on Dagang 1st Road carried out propaganda and mobilization among the masses on the one hand, and started cleaning the streets on the other, driving the nearby residents to clean up together. One hundred and twelve young people living on Baoshan Road organized themselves from the beginning of the anti-bacterial warfare movement and have continued to do a good job in cleaning and sanitation work until now, without letting up. The young people in the area of Wudi 2nd Road, Nenjiang Road, Rehe Road, and Huangtai Road thoroughly cleaned the two stinking ditches along Dalian Road and Wudi 2nd Road, which were about five li in total length. Many young people also helped the families of martyrs and soldiers who lacked labor to clean their houses.

    After this movement, the city has taken on a neat and clean new look. In order to consolidate the existing achievements, many families have now formulated a system of rotating cleaning and regular cleanliness inspections; some have also revised the patriotic covenant, adding the contents of "regularly maintaining personal and environmental hygiene, and developing good habits of cleanliness" and "catching rats and killing insects at any time" to the patriotic covenant. Many factory workers also regard doing a good job in epidemic prevention and hygiene as one of the contents of the Red May competition.

    The enemy's bacterial warfare did not frighten the people of Qingdao. On the contrary, it only aroused the people of Qingdao's deeper hatred for American imperialism. When the people of Qingdao saw the confessions of American air force prisoners of war Inak and Quinn, everyone unanimously expressed angrily: We must raise our vigilance, strengthen our work, and be prepared to crush any new conspiracy of the enemy at any time!

    青岛人民反细菌战的斗争
    杨　阳
    自三月六日美国侵略者把罪恶的细菌战扩大到青岛后，全市人民在激怒中投入了反细菌战的斗争。全市人民提出了坚决的口号：“不彻底扑灭敌人的细菌毒焰，决不收兵！”
    全市医药卫生工作者和科学工作者，在敌机撒布细菌毒虫后，立即举行了紧急动员大会。各大、中学的师生和工人、农民、街道居民，都先后召开了座谈会。在所有的会上，人们都激昂地表示：一面要加强抗美援朝工作，努力增产节约，更好地支援中朝人民军队，来惩罚这些细菌战犯；一面要开展灭虫、捕鼠和清洁卫生工作，彻底粉碎敌人制造瘟疫的阴谋。为了扑灭敌人投下的细菌毒虫，科学卫生工作者和专家教授们，废寝忘餐地工作着。山东大学的细菌学教授经常在实验室中工作到深夜，有时连饭都顾不得吃。新药业工会会员也纷纷将他们存储的有关防疫与消毒的药物，成批地捐献出来，并争先报名参加配制各种杀虫消毒药剂的工作。许多私人开业医生也参加反细菌战的斗争。青岛市科学技术普及协会的三百多会员和全市各大、中学师生以及各种宣传组织，向全市人民展开了反细菌战的宣传工作。他们深入里院，向群众揭发美帝国主义的罪行，并讲解防疫卫生常识，说明细菌武器的防御方法及捕捉毒虫的具体方法。他们利用实物、显微镜透视和挂图、幻灯、电影等工具，来帮助说明什么是细菌，病菌传染的途径、扑灭的方法等等。这样，不仅巩固了群众战胜细菌战的信心，而且使广大群众掌握了科学方法，加强了防御力量。
    全市掀起了捕鼠灭虫运动，很多路段的居民组织了“灭虫队”，发起了捕鼠灭虫的红旗竞赛，有些妇女采用“变工互助”、组织临时托儿所等方法，抽出大部人力，投入反细菌战的斗争。在捕鼠灭虫运动获得了重大成绩之后，全市人民又普遍开展了清洁卫生运动。家家户户都由室内到室外，彻底进行了大扫除，把衣物、床铺及其他一切用具，一一加以清刷和整理。安东路六号读报组的全体居民在控诉了美国侵略者的血腥罪行后，马上就把全院内外打扫干净，并洒了石炭酸水和生石灰。中山路七十二号和七十七号的居民，并发起了清洁竞赛。
    在清洁卫生运动中，青年特别发挥了积极作用。他们除了首先把自己家里收拾干净外，又自动组织起来，清扫大院和马路。住在大港一路的六十多个青年，一面向群众进行宣传动员，一面就动手清扫街道，带动了附近的居民也一齐动手清扫。住在宝山路的青年一百一十二人，从反细菌战运动开始时就组织起来，直到现在还一直坚持着做好清洁卫生工作，没有松过劲。芜棣二路、嫩江路、热河路、黄台路一带的青年，把沿着大连路和芜棣二路的两条全长约五华里的臭水沟，作了彻底的清理。许多青年并帮助缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属打扫屋子。
    经过这次运动，全市已出现一副整齐清洁的新面貌。为了巩固已有的成绩，很多人家现在都已制订了轮流清扫和定期检查清洁的制度；有的人并修订了爱国公约，把“经常保持个人卫生及环境卫生、养成爱好清洁的好习惯”、“随时捕鼠灭虫”等内容，添订到爱国公约里面去。很多工厂职工在红五月竞赛中，也把做好防疫卫生工作当作内容之一。
    敌人的细菌战并没有吓倒青岛人民，相反地，它只激起青岛人民对美帝国主义的更深的仇恨。当青岛人民看到美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词后，大家一致愤怒地表示：一定要提高警惕，加强工作，准备随时粉碎敌人的任何新的阴谋！
