Strive to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Germany
-- "Pravda" Editorial on the 26th

The Soviet government's note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany was published on May 25th. This note demonstrates the Soviet government's attitude towards the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany to establish an all-German government.

The German question is a central issue of concern to people all over the world, because the danger of the resurgence of German militarism, which twice launched world wars, has not yet been eliminated, and the decisions of the Potsdam Conference have not yet been fulfilled. A peace treaty with Germany must guarantee the elimination of the possibility of the resurgence of German militarism and German aggression, and must satisfy the legitimate national interests of the German people. Such a treaty will allow the final resolution of the various problems arising from World War II.

Will Germany be restored as a unified, independent, and peace-loving country, becoming a member of the family of peace-loving European nations, or will it be divided, resulting in Europe continuing to suffer the threat of war? Now is the time to decide this question. To the question posed by a group of American newspaper editors, "Do you think now is the appropriate time to unify Germany?" Comrade Stalin replied, "Yes, I think it is."

The necessity of concluding a peace treaty with Germany has long been ripe. The Potsdam Agreement, signed shortly after the end of the war, several years ago, charged the four powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France with handling the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. At the Moscow and London Four Foreign Ministers' Conferences in 1947, and at the Paris Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1949, the Soviet government put forward concrete proposals on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, consistently pursuing a policy that conformed to the interests of the peaceful development of all countries.

However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have pursued a completely different and opposite policy on the German question. They have blatantly violated the Potsdam Agreement, not only rejecting all practical ways to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, but also implementing many unilateral measures that have deepened the division of Germany.

The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a firm policy of safeguarding peace in Europe and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and in February of this year, in response to the request of the German Democratic Republic to the four powers to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the Soviet government declared: "The Soviet government is willing to do its utmost to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and restore the unity of Germany."

On March 10, 1952, the Soviet government proposed to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that they immediately discuss the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of establishing an all-German government. In order to facilitate and promote the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany, the Soviet government put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany drafted by the Soviet government, and at the same time expressed its willingness to consider other suggestions that might be made on this issue.

The Soviet draft principles for a peace treaty with Germany have been warmly supported by all peace-loving people. The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement saying: "The struggle of German patriots to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible and to restore the unity of Germany has received strong and effective support beyond the most daring expectations. At such a historic moment, the Soviet people have once again shown themselves to be true friends of the German people."

Facts have proved that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France continue to do everything possible to delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and to delay the resolution of the issue of unifying Germany and establishing an all-German government. If a peace treaty is not concluded and Germany is not unified, then it will not be possible to establish an independent German government with full rights to express the true will of the German people.

The Soviet note of May 24 pointed out that the United States government has once again raised many questions in order to continue the exchange of notes that has been dragging on for several months, rather than seeking a four-power conference to conduct direct negotiations and begin jointly studying the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and all related issues. The United States government does not want to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and does not want to end the division of Germany. Not only that, but the United States government, as well as the British and French governments, are simultaneously conducting unilateral secret negotiations with the West German Bonn government while prolonging the exchange of notes, discussing the conclusion of a so-called "general" treaty.

The Soviet note of May 24 said: "The Soviet government considers it necessary to remind you of the following fact: while continuing to exchange notes, the United States government and the British and French governments are conducting separate negotiations with the West German Bonn government to conclude a so-called 'general' treaty. In fact, this is not a 'general' treaty, but a separate treaty disguised as 'general' in order to deceive the people. It is clear from this that the Potsdam Agreement, which entrusted the four countries (the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) to prepare a peace treaty with Germany, is being completely undermined."

The Soviet government's note of May 24 revealed the content of this separate treaty, the so-called "general" treaty. The American and British imperialists are plotting, through this treaty, to maintain the system of military occupation and place West Germany in a dependent and subordinate position in its relations with the United States government and the British and French governments.

The "general" treaty is an open military alliance between the United States, Britain, France, and the West German government. It wants to incorporate West Germany into the self-proclaimed "European Group," which will become a component of the North Atlantic Group. Therefore, the American and British imperialists are not only trying to completely separate one part of Germany from another, but also to turn one part of Germany against another. The United States government is rushing to conclude new separate agreements, dreaming of linking West Germany and the West German army, which is being restored, more closely to the North Atlantic Group than before.

The agreement between the West German revanchist ruling group - which represents the most aggressive group in Europe - and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is based on the condition of supporting the revanchist illusions of the Adenauer Bonn government, which is preparing to launch a new war in Europe. In addition, the incorporation of the West German army, headed by fascist-Hitlerite generals, into the so-called "European Army," and thus also into the North Atlantic Group's army, more clearly illustrates the aggressive nature of the entire North Atlantic Group.

The Soviet government, following its policy of peace and considering the interests of consolidating overall peace, therefore reiterated in its note of May 24 to the United States government and the British and French governments its proposal to begin jointly discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of unifying Germany and establishing an all-German government.

If the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany is further delayed, it can only cause justifiable dissatisfaction among the German people. The policies of the Western countries are forcing the German people to find their own ways to resolve the issue of a peace treaty and the unification of all Germany.

The Soviet note on a peace treaty with Germany has aroused comments from various countries. Democratic newspapers praised the note as another major contribution to the resolution of the German question, and as proof of the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace.

The German people are at a turning point in their history. Inspired by the idea of the just cause of fighting for the unification of Germany, they are stepping up their opposition to the Bonn government's disastrous and anti-national policies, which are trying to turn the German people into cannon fodder for American imperialism.

The German people, who are fighting for fundamental national interests and for the establishment of a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany, are defending the cause of peace in Europe and peace in the world. All peace-loving people sympathize with and support the German people. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 26)

    争取与德国缔结和约
    ——苏联“真理报”二十六日社论
    苏联政府就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会已于五月二十五日发表。这个照会表明了苏联政府对于对德和约问题以及统一德国成立全德政府问题的态度。
    德国问题是全世界人民共同关怀的中心问题，因为那种曾经两次发动世界大战的德国军国主义复活的危险仍然没有消除，波茨坦会议的各项决定仍然没有得到履行。对德和约必须保证消除德国军国主义和德国侵略再起的可能，必须满足德国人民合法的民族利益，这样一个和约将使得因第二次世界大战而产生的种种问题最后获得解决。
    德国将恢复为统一、独立与爱好和平的国家，成为欧洲爱好和平国家大家庭的一员呢，还是将要分裂，结果使欧洲继续遭受战争的威胁呢？目前正是要决定这个问题的时候了。对于美国一批报纸编辑的问题“你认为现在是统一德国的适当时机吗？”斯大林同志回答说：“是的，我认为是这样。”
    缔结对德和约的必要性老早就已经成熟了。战争结束以后不久、也就是几年以前签订的波茨坦协定，曾经责成苏、美、英、法四大国处理缔结对德和约的问题。在一九四七年莫斯科和伦敦两次四国外长会议上，在一九四九年的巴黎四国外长会议上，苏联政府都曾就缔结对德和约问题提出过具体的建议，一贯坚持地奉行符合各国和平发展利益的政策。
    而美、英、法三国政府在对德问题上则奉行着完全不同的相反的政策。它们公然无忌地破坏波茨坦协定，不仅拒绝了一切缔结对德和约的切实办法，而且还实行了许多片面的措施，加深了德国的分裂。
    苏联过去和现在始终执行着保障欧洲和平以及缔结对德和约的坚定不移的政策，本年二月，为了答复德意志民主共和国就加速缔结对德和约问题致四大国的要求，苏联政府宣告：“苏联政府愿尽其所能加速缔结对德和约，并恢复德国的统一。”
    一九五二年三月十日，苏联政府向美、英、法三国政府建议，立即讨论对德和约问题和成立全德政府的问题。为了便利并促进对德和约的准备工作，苏联政府提出了苏联政府所草拟的对德和约草案，同时又表示愿意考虑可能提出的关于这个问题的其他建议。
    苏联的对德和约原则草案，受到了一切爱好和平人民的热烈的拥护。德意志民主共和国政府发表声明说：“德国爱国者争取尽早缔结和约、争取恢复德国统一的斗争，获得了出乎最大胆的预料之外的有力而有效的支持。在这样一个历史性的时刻，苏联人民再一次表明自己是德国人民的真诚的朋友。”
    事实证明：美、英、法三国政府继续千方百计地拖延对德和约的缔结，拖延统一德国问题和成立全德政府问题的解决。而如果和约不得缔结，德国不得统一，那么就不可能成立具有表示德国全国人民的真正意志之充分权利的独立的德国政府。
    苏联五月二十四日的照会指出：美国政府再一次提出了许多问题，以求继续已拖延了好几个月的照会的往返，而不是想四国开会来进行直接谈判，并开始共同研究对德和约问题及一切有关的问题。美国政府不希望缔结对德和约，不希望结束德国的分裂。不但如此，美国政府以及英国和法国政府一方面拖长照会的往来，同时却又在与西德波恩政府进行片面的秘密谈判，讨论缔结所谓“一般性”条约的问题。
    苏联五月二十四日的照会说：“苏联政府认为有必要提醒你们注意下述事实：在继续交换照会的时候，美国政府和英国与法国政府又在和西德波恩政府进行着缔结一个关于所谓‘一般性’条约的单独谈判。事实上，这并不是‘一般性’条约，而是诡称为‘一般性’，以便欺骗人民的单独和约。由此可见，委托四国（美国、英国、法国和苏联）准备对德和约的波茨坦协定正在被彻底破坏。”
    苏联政府五月二十四日的照会揭露了所谓“一般性”条约这个单独条约的内容，美英帝国主义者阴谋借着这个条约，保持军事占领制度，使西德在对美国政府以及英法两国政府的关系中，处在依存和附属的地位。
    “一般性”条约是美英法和西德政府间的公开军事联盟，它想把西德并入自称的“欧洲集团”里，这个“欧洲集团”将成为北大西洋集团的一个组成部分。因此，美英帝国主义者不仅正力图使德国的一部分与另一部分彻底分离，并要使德国的一部分反对另一部分。美国政府急忙缔结新的单独协定，梦想使西德和正在恢复中的西德陆军比以前更紧密地与北大西洋集团连结起来。
    西德复仇主义统治集团——它代表着欧洲的最富侵略性的集团——和北大西洋国家集团间的协定是以支持阿登纳波恩政府的复仇幻想这样一个条件为基础的，波恩政府正准备在欧洲发动新的战争。另外一方面，把以法西斯——希特勒分子的将领为首的西德陆军并入所谓“欧洲军”，因而也就是并入北大西洋集团陆军，更清楚地说明了整个北大西洋集团的侵略性。
    苏联政府遵循它的和平外交政策，并考虑到巩固全面和平的利益，因而在五月二十四日的照会中再度向美国政府及英法政府建议开始共同讨论关于对德和约的问题，以及关于统一德国和成立全德政府的问题。
    如果再延不解决关于对德和约与统一德国的问题，那只能引起德国人民的正当的不满情绪，西方国家的政策使德国人民必须自己想办法来解决和约与统一全德国的问题。
    苏联关于对德和约的照会引起了各国的评论。民主报纸盛赞这个照会是对于解决德国问题的另一个重大贡献，它是苏联一贯的和平外交政策的证明。
    德国人民正处在他们历史上的转折点，他们在为统一德国而斗争的正义事业的思想的鼓舞下，正在加紧反对阿登纳波恩政府的祸国殃民的反民族政策，波恩政府正在设法把德国人民变为美帝国主义者的炮灰。
    为根本的民族利益及建立统一、独立、民主及和平的德国而斗争的德国人民，正在保卫着欧洲和平及全世界和平的事业。一切爱好和平的人民是同情和支持德国人民的。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日电）
