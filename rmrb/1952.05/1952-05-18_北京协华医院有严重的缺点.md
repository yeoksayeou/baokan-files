    Beijing Xiehua Hospital Has Serious Shortcomings
    Editor: I am now reporting the illegal acts of the Beijing Xiehua Hospital administration. The hospital stipulates that convalescents should pay 9,000 yuan per person per day for food expenses, which, reasonably, should mean they eat very well. However, in December of last year, we ate third-grade flour for a month, and then ate sweet potatoes for three meals in a row. We usually only get tofu, shredded tofu, and cabbage, with very little oil, and even less meat. As far as we know, the Xiehua Hospital administration skims off at least 3,000 yuan per person per day from our food expenses. This has caused malnutrition among patients, seriously affecting the health of the convalescents. The medical staff of the hospital has repeatedly mistreated patients, and the nurse He Zhiyong often beats patients Zhang Zhijian and Gong Yuncheng. In March of this year, the nurse Zhou Fuzhen beat a patient until his mouth and nose bled. During the "Five-Anti" campaign, nurse Zhang Zhanyuan injected patients with 25% glucose as if it were 50% glucose. In September of last year, the nurse Zhou Fuzhen even allowed patient Gu Yousheng to take medicine with dirty water.
    These mistakes of Xiehua Hospital are serious, and the person in charge of the hospital must conduct a profound self-criticism.

### 北京协华医院有严重的缺点

    北京协华医院有严重的缺点
    编辑同志：现在我检举北京协华医院院方的不法行为。该院规定休养员每人每天缴纳伙食费九千元，按理是应该吃得很好的。但是去年十二月间，我们吃了一个月的三等面，又连吃了三顿白薯。我们平常只吃到豆腐、豆腐丝、白菜，油也很少，肉更少了。据我们所知，协华医院院方每天至少要剥削我们每一个人三千元的伙食费。这就使病人发生了营养不足的现象，严重地影响了休养员的健康。该院的医务人员屡次虐待病人，护理员何志勇并常常殴打病人张志坚、宫云成。今年三月间，护理员周福桢把一个病人打得口鼻流血。在“五反”期间，护士张占元以百分之二十五的葡萄糖当作百分之五十的葡萄糖给病人注射。去年九月间，护理员周福桢竟让病人古友胜用脏水服药。
    协华医院的这些错误是严重的，院方负责人必须进行深刻检讨。
　休养员　王金保
