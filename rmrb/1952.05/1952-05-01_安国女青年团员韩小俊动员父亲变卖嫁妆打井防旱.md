    An'guo Female Youth League Member Han Xiaojun Mobilizes Father to Sell Dowry to Dig Well for Drought Prevention
    Han Xiaojun, a Youth League member from Panggezhuang Village, An'guo County, Hebei Province, learned at a League meeting that to achieve patriotic bumper harvests, dry land must be turned into paddy fields. When she returned home for dinner, she mobilized her father to dig a well. Her father, Han Lotou, said, "Digging a well is a good thing, but we can't do it without money!" Han Xiaojun quickly said, "Those six pieces of dowry clothing you bought me, I don't wear them now. Wouldn't it be money if we sold them?" Then she added, "Even if I get married, I won't wear these fancy clothes. Why not turn something dead into something living, sell them, and dig a well with the neighboring households?" Her father, Han Lotou, was convinced by his daughter and dug a new well with the neighboring households according to her wishes.
    After mobilizing her father to dig a new well, Han Xiaojun is now helping her father select cotton seeds and irrigate the white fields in order to prepare for spring planting.

　  来信摘要
    安国女青年团员韩小俊动员父亲变卖嫁妆打井防旱
    河北省安国县庞各庄村青年团员韩小俊，在团员会上知道要想搞好爱国丰产，就必须把旱田变成水田的道理后，回家吃饭的时候就动员她的父亲打井。她的父亲韩洛头说：“打井是好事，可是没有钱也办不了啊！”韩小俊忙着说：“你给我买的那六件陪嫁衣服，现在也穿不着，卖掉不就是钱吗？”接着她又说：“就是结婚，这些花花绿绿的衣服我也穿不着，为啥不变死物为活物，把它卖掉和邻地户合伙打一眼井呢？”韩洛头被她的女儿说得心服口服以后，就按照她的意思和邻地户合打了一眼新井。
    韩小俊在动员她父亲打成一眼新井以后，为了做好春播准备工作，现在正帮助她父亲挑选棉籽和灌浇白地。
