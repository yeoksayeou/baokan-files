Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th Dispatch from TASS: “Akahata” reports that the All-Around Reconciliation Patriotic Movement Council has called on workers to hold rallies and strikes to protest the police's bloody suppression of the May Day demonstrators in Tokyo.

    The leading organs of the Japanese Communist Party issued an open letter to the people of the world, calling on the people of the world to aid the Japanese people suffering from brutal terror and persecution, and to send an international investigation team to Tokyo.
