Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 26th - Since the fourth item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks concerning the issue of prisoners of war began, the US side has been playing tricks with the numbers of prisoners of war, attempting to achieve its goal of detaining a large number of our captured personnel. However, the US side's own contradictory situation regarding the numbers of prisoners of war fully proves that the absurd plan proposed by the US side to repatriate 70,000 of our prisoners of war is just a shameless swindle.

When the US side handed over to our side a list of our captured personnel on December 18 last year, it announced that there were a total of 133,930 of our captured personnel, but the names listed in the list were only 132,474, a number that was 1,456 less than the total number of prisoners of war claimed by the US side at the same time, and if compared with the list of prisoners of war transferred to our side by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the difference was as much as 44,200. After this huge difference was exposed by our side, the US side initially claimed that this difference was due to the untimely materials transferred by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and later claimed that this difference was due to the fact that 37,000 of them were residents of South Korea, initially saying that these 37,000 prisoners of war had been released, but later claiming that they were still in prisoner of war camps. After making such contradictory and sophistical arguments, the US side, feeling guilty, has always been afraid to hand over the materials related to the aforementioned shortage of 1,456 and 44,205 people. But the trick has been exposed, and the US side has had to brazenly and secretly admit that they have more than 170,000 of our captured personnel in their hands, and had to admit that their so-called "South Korean civilians" are actually "civilians" from northern Korea. As late as April 26, a broadcast by the American military radio station in Tokyo stated: "The Allied forces have a total of 173,635 Communist soldiers and civilians." But the US side's conspiracy to forcibly detain a large number of our captured personnel has not changed as a result.

On the subcommittee of the fourth agenda item on December 22 last year, the US side also unreasonably demanded to detain 16,243 of our captured personnel from the already handed over list of prisoners of war, which means that they would only be willing to repatriate more than 116,000 of our captured personnel. After our side proposed fair and reasonable prisoner repatriation principles on March 21, the US side still expressed its willingness to resolve the issue within the outline of the principles proposed by our side, and specifically stated that the prisoners of war they would repatriate to our side would be around 116,000. But on April 19, the US side brazenly proposed the absurd figure of 70,000 people to be repatriated to our side. Thus, if calculated according to the list of 132,000 of our captured personnel handed over by the US side, the US side would unreasonably detain 62,000 of our captured personnel; if calculated according to the 173,000 once admitted by the US side, then the US side would detain as many as 103,000 of our captured personnel. Ridgway even brazenly called such an extremely unreasonable plan "just and impartial." As long as people take a look at the above-mentioned methods used by the US side in the negotiations, they will know how absurd and shameless Ridgway's statement is!

The US side still does not have a unified statement on the number of our captured personnel until recently. UN Command spokesman Hickman said on April 25 that there were 173,000 people, and the US military radio station in Tokyo said on April 26 even more specifically, even including the odd numbers, saying that there were 173,635 people, but the so-called UN Command announced on May 20 that there were only 169,000 people (United Press, Tokyo, 21st). The American aggressors, who are constantly carrying out bloody massacres and brutal persecution of our captured personnel, obviously intentionally do not clearly explain how many of our captured personnel are still alive in their hands. The American aggressors are not even willing to clarify the number of prisoners of war in their hands, so what qualifications do they have to say something like "the investigation results show that only 70,000 prisoners are willing to be repatriated"? What qualifications do they have to call their purely fictitious and absurd plan a "fair overall solution" that "requires full acceptance by the Communist side"?

### 美方在遣俘问题上玩弄数字把戏矛盾百出  证明美方所谓遣俘方案是一个无耻骗局

    美方在遣俘问题上玩弄数字把戏矛盾百出
    证明美方所谓遣俘方案是一个无耻骗局
    【新华社开城二十六日电】自从朝鲜停战谈判有关战俘问题的第四项议程开始以来，美方就一直在战俘数字上玩把戏，企图达到其扣留我方大批被俘人员的目的。但是，美方自己在有关战俘数字上矛盾百出的情形，完全证明美方提出的遣返我方七万战俘的荒谬方案只是一个无耻的骗局。
    美方在去年十二月十八日交给我方关于我方被俘人员名单时，曾宣布我方被俘人员共有十三万三千九百三十名，但是名单中所列举的姓名却只有十三万二千四百七十四名，这个数字较之美方同时所声称的战俘总数就少了一千四百五十六名，而如果和美方经由红十字国际委员会转交我方的战俘名单相比较，则竟相差四万四千二百多人。在这一个巨大差额被我方揭露以后，美方始而声称这一差额是由于红十字国际委员会转来的材料是不及时的材料，后来又声称这一差额是由于其中三万七千人是南朝鲜的居民，起初说这三万七千名战俘已经释放，后来却又声称他们仍然在战俘营中。在作了这样矛盾百出的狡辩以后，贼胆心虚的美方始终不敢把有关上述短少的一千四百五十六名和四万四千二百零五人的材料交出来。但是把戏已经拆穿，美方就不得不厚着脸皮偷偷地承认在他们手中有我方被俘人员十七万多名，并且不得不承认他们的所谓“南朝鲜平民”实际上都是朝鲜北部的“平民”。直到四月二十六日，东京的美国军中电台的广播还说：“联军手上共有十七万三千六百三十五名共方兵士和平民”。但是美方强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的阴谋并不因此而有所改变。
    在去年十二月二十二日的第四项议程小组委员会上美方又蛮横无理地提出还要扣留已交出的战俘名单中的一万六千二百四十三名我方被俘人员，这就是说，只肯遣返十一万六千多名我方被俘人员。在我方于三月二十一日提出公平合理的遣俘原则建议以后，美方仍表示愿意在我方所提原则的轮廓下解决问题，并具体表示其将遣返我方的战俘约在十一万六千人左右。但到了四月十九日，美方却又悍然提出拟遣返给我方七万人的荒谬数字。这样，如果照美方交来的十三万二千人的我方被俘人员名单计算，美方就要无理扣留我方被俘人员六万二千人；如果照美方曾经承认的十七万三千人计算，那美方就要扣留我方被俘人员达十万三千人之多。李奇微还居然把这样一个无理已极的方案称之为“公正的和不偏不倚的”，人们只要看一看美方在谈判中所耍弄的上述种种手段，就知道李奇微的这句话是何等荒唐，何等无耻！
    美方对于我方被俘人员的数字，直到最近还是没有一个统一的说法。联合国军发言人希克曼在四月二十五日说有十七万三千人，东京美国军中电台在四月二十六日说得更具体，连零数也有了，说是有十七万三千六百三十五人，可是所谓联合国军司令部在五月二十日却宣布只有十六万九千名了（合众社东京二十一日电）。不断对我方被俘人员进行血腥屠杀和残酷迫害的美国侵略者，显然有意不交代清楚究竟还有多少我方被俘人员活在他们手里。美国侵略者连他们手中战俘的数字都不肯说清楚，还有什么资格来说什么“调查结果，只有七万俘虏表示愿意被遣返”之类的鬼话？还有什么资格把它的纯粹出于虚构的荒谬方案称之为“需要共方全盘接受的”“公正的全盘解决办法”？
