Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 9th: According to TASS, Tokyo, May 8th: On May 6th, the Japanese Diet questioned the government regarding the events that occurred in Tokyo during the May Day celebrations.
    Japanese Communist Party member of the Diet, Kazahaya Yasoji, stated in the House of Representatives: The People's Plaza (the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace) is not the exclusive property of the American army and the Japanese police; it belongs to the people. Therefore, approximately 100,000 people orderly marched to the plaza to exercise their legitimate rights. However, the government illegally dispatched thousands of police officers who carried out a premeditated beating of the demonstrating masses.
    Kazahaya Yasoji pointed out that the police opened fire after a signal was given by an American military police officer. Kazahaya said that the police are now serving foreigners, and their mission is to massacre Japanese citizens. The Yoshida government and the police authorities should bear full responsibility for the Tokyo incident. We demand full compensation for the victims, the dismissal of the Tokyo Police Superintendent-General and all the police officers who participated in the massacre, and their severe punishment. The Yoshida Cabinet should resign immediately.
    Kazahaya Yasoji then pointed out that, due to the thousands of police officers using such lawless and deliberate brutality, the people exercised their right to self-defense and carried out resolute resistance, which is an expression of national indignation. This is a signal of the struggle against imperialism, a signal that has been repeated many times in the history of Asian colonies. The Japanese know that Japan has fallen into the status of an enslaved colonial country. Under American occupation, such incidents will continue to occur. As long as these two traitorous treaties are in effect, the people's mass resistance movement will never stop.
    Another Communist Party member of the Diet, Kan'iwa Den'ichi, stated in the House of Councillors that the May Day incident was a result of the people's hatred of the Yoshida government, which sold Japan's independence to the United States, and the direct cause was the workers' anger provoked by the prohibition of using the People's Plaza.
    Although the Yoshida government allows foreign troops to freely use the People's Plaza for parades and allows it to be used for royal ceremonies, it prohibits the sovereign people from using it to celebrate their holidays. This is nothing but a challenge to the working people. The government should bear the responsibility for the bloodshed. The government not only did not extend condolences to the families of the victims, but also openly recognized the actions of the executioner – the police. This incident is the result of the accumulation of dissatisfaction during the seven years of occupation and after the conclusion of the "Peace Treaty" and the "Security Treaty," which were forcibly accepted by Japan under a traitorous cabinet that obeyed foreign orders. Such incidents will continue to occur, and the strength will become greater and greater, until the Yoshida government abolishes these two treaties and the administrative agreement.
    Socialist Party (Left) Shigemori Juzo stated in the House of Councillors that the disturbance was caused by the prohibition of using the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 9th: According to TASS, Tokyo, May 8th: Japanese democratic organizations have expressed indignation at the persecution of the demonstrators in Tokyo on May Day.
    The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions issued a statement saying: The incident of the brutal beating of the demonstrating masses in the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace fully exposes "the Yoshida Cabinet's insidiousness and the essence of the traitorous treaties." The statement said: The people of the whole country who are fighting for independence will never allow the existence of a colonial state. The Japanese working class must gather under the banner of national independence, unite the people of the whole country, and fight to smash the shackles of slavery. The people of the whole country must resolutely strive to force the Yoshida government to resign.
    The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions denounced the ulterior motives of right-wing trade union leaders and called on workers to hold a general strike to protest.
    The National Committee of the Miners' Unified Front issued a protest statement saying that the "May Day incident" was a conspiracy deliberately organized by the enemies of the Japanese people, and called on the Japanese working people to hold a general strike to protest.
    The Student Self-Government Association of the University of Tokyo demanded the immediate resignation of the Yoshida government and the Tokyo Police Superintendent-General, and demanded the release of the arrested students. The association also called on students to hold a strike to protest.
    According to reports from democratic groups, the police received bullets and instructions before May Day, requiring each police officer to use sixteen bullets. Students at the University of Tokyo said that an American military policeman fired six shots at a student, whose body was later carried away by the police.

    日共国会议员和日本各民主组织
    痛斥吉田政府蓄谋屠杀示威人民
    主张严惩行凶警察、吉田内阁立即辞职
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社东京八日讯：五月六日，日本国会就五一节在东京发生的事件向政府提出质询。
    日本共产党议员风早八十二在国会众议院说：人民广场（皇宫前广场）并不是美国军队和日本警察的专利品，而是属于人民的，所以大约有十万人民秩序井然地走到广场去行使他们的合法权利。但是，政府非法派遣了数千警察，对示威群众施行了蓄谋已久的殴打。
    风早八十二指出，警察是在一名美国军事警察发出信号后开火的。风早说，警察现在是在为外国人服务，他们的任务是屠杀日本公民。东京事件的全部责任应由吉田政府和警察当局来负。我们要求给受害者以充分的补偿，撤销东京警察总监以及参加了屠杀的全体警察的职务，并予以严厉的惩罚，吉田内阁立即辞职。
    风早八十二继即指出，由于数千警察使用这种目无法纪的蓄意的残暴手段，人民群众行使了他们自卫的权利，进行了坚决的抵抗，这是民族愤慨的表现。这是反对帝国主义斗争的信号，这个信号在亚洲殖民地的历史上已经重复过许多次了。日本人知道，日本已经沦于一个受奴役的殖民地国家的地位。在美国占领下，这种事件还会继续发生。只要这两个卖国条约生效一天，人民的这种群众性的反抗运动就永远不会停止。
    另一位共产党议员兼岩传一在参议院说，五一节事件是人民仇恨把日本独立出卖给美国的吉田政府的结果，而直接原因是由于禁止使用人民广场激起了工人的愤怒。
    吉田政府虽然准许外国军队随便使用人民广场举行检阅，也准许用来举行皇家仪式，但却禁止有主权的人民用它来庆祝他们的节日。这不是别的，是对劳动人民的挑战。流血事件的责任应由政府来负。政府不仅未向牺牲者的家属致慰问之意，而且公开认可刽子手——警察的行动。这次事件是人民在七年的占领中以及缔结“和约”与“安全条约”后积下的不满情绪爆发的结果，这个“和约”与“安全条约”是在服从外国命令的卖国内阁下强使日本接受的。这种事件将会不断发生，而力量也将越来越大，直到吉田政府废除这两个条约和行政协定时为止。
    社会党左派重盛寿治在参议院说，骚动是由于禁止使用皇宫前广场而引起的。
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社东京八日讯：日本民主组织对迫害五一节东京示威群众的事件表示愤慨。
    全日本产业别工会会议发表声明说：在皇宫前广场发生的凶殴示威群众的事件，充分暴露了“吉田内阁的阴险和卖国条约的本质”。声明说：为争取独立而奋斗的全国人民决不容许殖民地状态存在下去。日本工人阶级必须在民族独立的旗帜下集合起来，团结全国人民，为粉碎奴役的枷锁而奋斗。全国人民必须坚决努力强迫吉田政府辞职。
    全日本产业别工会会议痛斥右翼工会领袖居心叵测，并号召工人举行总罢工，以示抗议。
    矿工统一战线全国委员会发表抗议声明说，“五一节事件”是日本人民的敌人处心积虑组织的阴谋，并号召日本劳动人民举行总罢工，以示抗议。
    东京大学学生自治会要求吉田政府和东京警察总监立即辞职，并要求释放被捕学生。自治会并号召学生举行罢课，以示抗议。
    据民主团体报告，警察在五一节前夕曾接到枪弹和训令，要每一个警察使用十六颗枪弹。东京大学学生说，一名美国宪兵曾向一个学生开了六枪，这个学生的尸体后来被警察抬走。
