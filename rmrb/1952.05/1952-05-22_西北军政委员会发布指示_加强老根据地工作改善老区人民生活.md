The Northwest Military and Political Committee issued a directive in late April regarding strengthening work in old revolutionary base areas. The directive requires governments at all levels to rapidly develop agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and other production in the old revolutionary base areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, improve the living standards of the people in the old areas, and, with a view to long-term construction, build up the rural areas of the old areas.

The directive requires the people's governments at all levels in the Northwest region to pay close attention to strengthening specific leadership over work in the old revolutionary base areas, and calls on the people and cadres at all levels in the old revolutionary base areas to act quickly and energetically, starting with the current spring plowing and drought prevention work, and launch a vigorous patriotic production increase movement throughout the region, striving for a bumper harvest this year and ensuring that every household has surplus grain within three years.

The directive calls on all localities to vigorously develop water conservancy, striving to expand the irrigated area by one million mu within five years; it also requires all localities to strengthen soil and water conservation work, advocate afforestation, strictly prohibit indiscriminate land reclamation, and systematically build mountain slopes into terraced fields, using methods such as digging water cellars and building dams to prevent floods and store water. The directive also points out: it is necessary to lead farmers to repair farm tools, increase draft animals, accumulate fertilizer, promote improved varieties, prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and promote the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance among farmers in the old revolutionary base areas, strengthen and develop agricultural cooperative organizations, and carry out production increase competitions.

The directive also points out that developing animal husbandry and all possible sideline and handicraft production in the old areas is important for improving people's living standards. All localities should, according to their specific circumstances, mobilize farmers to raise sheep, pigs, chickens, collect mountain products, dig medicinal materials, raise bees, pick tea, mine minerals, and develop family handicrafts. In order to facilitate transportation and promote product sales, the old areas of the three provinces should speed up the repair of roads this year, and mobilize the people to repair cart roads,驮运 roads and pedestrian roads during the slack farming season. Counties along the Yellow River should also strengthen the organization and leadership of river transport, add boats, and expand shipping.

This year, the Northwest region allocated a total of over 11.2 billion yuan in various agricultural loans to the old areas. The directive instructs that all localities in the old areas should ensure that these loans reach the farmers in a timely manner. Regarding strengthening cultural work, medical and health work, and preferential treatment and relief work, the directive requires that the people's governments at all levels in the old areas should strengthen them gradually and systematically in conjunction with production work. First of all, attention should be paid to popularizing education, vigorously promoting community-run primary schools, and expanding and establishing worker-peasant accelerated secondary schools and cadre cultural schools. Secondly, social education work should be strengthened practically, promoting and developing people's schools, literacy classes, newspaper reading groups, night schools, and other farmers' spare-time education, striving to have 100,000 people attend winter school this winter. In terms of medical and health care, priority should be given to strengthening the Yan'an People's Hospital and the people's health centers in each special district and county, and establishing health clinics in towns and cities with emphasis. Each province and special district should organize medical teams as much as possible to conduct mobile medical work in various places. Free treatment should be provided to impoverished people, families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of revolutionary soldiers. This year, education subsidies of 5.7 billion yuan and health subsidies of 5.7 billion yuan will be allocated and distributed uniformly by the provincial people's governments. In terms of preferential treatment and relief, the directive requires that the focus should be on helping the families of martyrs and soldiers to build homes through production and organizing disaster victims to help themselves through production. This year, the central government and the Northwest region allocated a total of 20.5 billion yuan in relief funds, subsidies, and disaster relief funds to the old revolutionary base areas. The directive requires that all localities must combine this with production when distributing the funds, and strictly prevent the deviations of simple relief and equal distribution.
