Economic Briefs

    ▲The people along the Yangtze and Han Rivers have safely passed the Taoxun flood season. In early May, continuous spring rains in the Yangtze and Han River basins caused the water levels of the two rivers to rise twice; the water levels of the Bahe and Tanghe tributaries of the Han River exceeded the danger level by one to two meters. This year's Taoxun flood level in the Yangtze and Han Rivers was the highest since 1936. To this end, the Middle Reaches Engineering Bureau of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission immediately sent urgent telegrams to engineering institutions in various places to step up the inspection of dikes at the beginning of the Taoxun flood; governments at all levels also mobilized the masses and cadres along the river to go to the dikes to guard them closely. Although several dangerous situations occurred during the flood season, they were safely overcome due to sufficient prior preparation.
    ▲The State-owned Huaibei Salt Field in northern Jiangsu has fully launched a spring patriotic production increase campaign. All salt workers began scooping pools to cultivate salt from late March, and by April 9th, they had cultivated 7,638 pools, producing 1.03 million catties of salt. This year, the field plans to increase production and save 25 billion yuan, requiring a 50% increase in output compared to last year, a 2% increase in quality, and a 15% reduction in costs. In order to successfully complete this year's production increase and savings plan, the CPC Huaibei Salt Area Committee and the Huaibei Salt Affairs Bureau decided to make the discovery and promotion of advanced production experience the central link in realizing this year's production increase and savings plan.
    ▲Qiemo County is located on the northern foothills of the Kunlun Mountains and is the most remote county on the southern edge of the southern Xinjiang desert. Qiemo County has the Dandan River, which is the lifeblood of the farmers, irrigating more than 70,000 mu of fertile farmland. Under the rule of the reactionaries before liberation, the Dalongkou water conservancy project on the Dandan River had been in disrepair for many years, and the river water not only could not irrigate the land, but also often flooded. In order to eliminate the scourge of the Dandan River and develop agricultural production, the Qiemo County People's Government led the farmers to repair the Dalongkou once last year, and also established a water conservancy management committee to rationally allocate water, so the Uyghur farmers of Qiemo County had a bumper harvest last year. This year, in order to increase production patriotically, the farmers of Qiemo County demanded that the Dalongkou of the Dandan River be thoroughly repaired. To this end, the People's Government led the farmers to start construction. More than 2,000 people worked selflessly for more than a month and have repaired this huge project with nine water outlets.

    ▲长江和汉江沿岸人民已安然度过桃汛期。五月初旬，长江和汉江流域春雨连绵，两江水位两度上涨；汉江的白河、唐河诸支流水位超过危险水位一公尺到二公尺。今年长江和汉江桃汛水位是一九三六年以来最高的一次。为此，长江水利委员会中游工程局在桃汛刚到之初，即急电各地工程机构加紧检查堤防；各级人民政府也动员沿江群众和干部上堤，严密防守。汛期内虽曾发生几处险象，但由于事先准备充分，都安然度过险期。
    ▲苏北国营淮北盐场全面展开了春季爱国增产运动。全体盐工从三月下旬开始舀池种盐，到四月九日止，已种盐七千六百三十八池，产盐一百零三万斤。该场今年计划增产节约二百五十亿元，要求较去年增加产量百分之五十，提高质量百分之二，降低成本百分之十五。为了顺利完成今年的增产节约计划，中共淮北盐区党委会和淮北盐务管理局，决定把发掘与推广先进生产经验作为实现今年增产节约计划的中心环节。
    ▲且末县位于昆仑山北麓，是南疆大沙漠南面最偏僻的县份。且末县有一条旦旦河，是农民的命脉，灌溉着七万多亩肥沃的农田。在解放前的反动派统治下，旦旦河的大龙口水利工程多年失修，河水不但不能浇地，而且时常泛滥成灾。为消除旦旦河水患，发展农业生产，去年且末县人民政府就领导农民补修了一次大龙口，又建立了水利管理委员会，合理分配用水，因而去年且末县的维吾尔族农民得到了丰收。今年为了爱国增产，且末县农民要求彻底修好旦旦河的大龙口。为此，人民政府就领导农民动工兴修。两千多人一个多月奋不顾身地劳动，已修复了这个有着九个水口的巨大工程。
