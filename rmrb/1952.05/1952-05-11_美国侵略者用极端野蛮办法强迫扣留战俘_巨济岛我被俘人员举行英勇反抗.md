Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th—Because the American aggressors are using extremely barbaric methods to forcibly detain our captured personnel, our captured personnel in the 76th POW camp on Geoje Island indignantly detained the American POW camp负责人 Brigadier General Dodd on the afternoon of May 7th, who directly persecuted our captured personnel. This heroic act of resistance by our captured personnel is entirely out of unbearable indignation and is completely justified. As everyone already knows, in order to achieve the goal of detaining our captured personnel, the American aggressors have not hesitated to adopt all kinds of brutal and coercive measures. They inhumanly forced our captured personnel to tattoo characters on their bodies, forced them to write pledges in blood, and inflicted torture and even massacre for the slightest disobedience. This barbaric behavior of the American aggressors has completely lost its "humanity" and reached a point that is intolerable to people.

Regarding this justified and reasonable act of resistance by our captured personnel, American aggressor army commander Ridgway openly ordered on May 9th to "use all force" to suppress it. According to a May 10th report by the Associated Press, "armed personnel have surrounded this camp" and are "preparing to attack fiercely." The American aggressors do not hesitate to carry out even more brutal massacres than before against our captured personnel who are heroically unyielding and resolutely refuse to be detained. However, the firm will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation is clearly impossible to be shaken by any violence. The American aggressors will bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by the harm to our captured personnel.

    美国侵略者用极端野蛮办法强迫扣留战俘
    巨济岛我被俘人员举行英勇反抗
    【新华社开城十日电】由于美国侵略者用极端野蛮的办法强迫扣留我方被俘人员，在巨济岛上美军七十六号战俘营的我方被俘人员在五月七日下午激愤地扣留了直接对我方被俘人员进行迫害的美方战俘营负责人杜德准将。我方被俘人员这种英勇的反抗行为完全是出于忍无可忍，是完全正当的。如大家已知道的，美国侵略者为了达到扣留我方被俘人员的目的，曾不惜采取一切残暴的强迫手段。他们惨无人道地强迫在我方被俘人员身上刺字，强迫写血书，稍有违抗，即施以酷刑以至屠杀。美国侵略者的这种野蛮行为，已完全丧失了“人道”，到达人所不能容忍的地步。
    对于我方被俘人员的这种正当合理的反抗行为，美国侵略军总司令李奇微竟在五月九日公然下令“采取一切武力”加以镇压。据美联社十日消息，“武装人员已包围了这个营场”，“准备猛攻”。美国侵略者已不惜对我方英勇不屈、坚决拒绝扣留的被俘人员进行比以前更为残暴的屠杀。但是，我方被俘人员要求遣返的坚强意志显然是不可能为任何暴力所动摇的。对于我方被俘人员的残害所引起的一切后果，美国侵略者将负全部责任。
