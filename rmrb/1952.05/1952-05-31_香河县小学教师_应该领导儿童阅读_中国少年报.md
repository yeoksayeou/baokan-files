    Xianghe County Elementary School Teachers
    Should Lead Children in Reading "Chinese Young Pioneers Daily"
    Editor: Since the joint notice issued by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on February 12 regarding assisting in the successful publication of the "Chinese Young Pioneers Daily" and carrying out subscription work, most elementary school teachers in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, have mobilized elementary school students to subscribe to the "Chinese Young Pioneers Daily" and guided them in their studies. However, some elementary school teachers do not pay attention to this issue, considering it an added burden. Some say, "Teaching the regular curriculum is enough to complete the task," while others say, "Mobilizing children to subscribe to the newspaper is too troublesome, it's better not to mobilize at all." When the township postman from the county post office discussed mobilizing children to subscribe to the newspaper with the teachers at Wangjiaban Village Elementary School in the Second District, Li Xiran, the principal of the central elementary school in the district, said, "Do you think I am running errands for you?" Elementary school teacher Li Fengzhong said, "None of our students will subscribe to this!"
    It can be seen from this that some elementary school teachers in Xianghe County are not paying attention to helping elementary school students read the "Chinese Young Pioneers Daily," and they do not value the education of children. I suggest that the Xianghe County Bureau of Culture and Education correct this phenomenon. Yu Ren

    香河县小学教师
    应该领导儿童阅读“中国少年报”
    编辑同志：二月十二日，中央人民政府教育部和青年团中央发出关于协助办好“中国少年报”及开展“中国少年报”订阅工作的联合通知以后，河北省香河县大部分小学教师都发动小学生订阅“中国少年报”，并领导他们进行学习。但是也有部分小学教师不重视这个问题，认为这是多了一个负担。有人说：“教完正课就算完成了任务”，也有人说：“发动儿童订报多麻烦，不如不发动好。”县邮局的乡邮员到二区王家板村小学和教师研究发动儿童订报的问题时，该区中心小学校长李希然说：“你认为我是给你们当小差吗？”小学教员李逢仲说：“我们的学生谁订这个呀！”
    由此可以看出，香河县部分小学教师是不注意帮助小学生阅读“中国少年报”的，他们对于儿童的教育是很不重视的。我建议香河县文教局纠正这种现象。　于仁
