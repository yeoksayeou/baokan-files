Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: Following a series of atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British government in which patriotic compatriots were persecuted and even killed, it unreasonably ordered the suspension of our people's newspaper, "Ta Kung Pao," for six months on May 5th. It also illegally sentenced Fei Yimin, the newspaper's owner and publisher, to nine months imprisonment or a fine of HK$4,000, and the editor, Li Zongying, to six months of hard labor or a fine of HK$3,000. Fei and Li were also ordered to pay HK$1,500 and HK$1,000 respectively in so-called "court fees." This incident is another provocative act by the British imperialists against the Chinese people.

Since the Churchill cabinet came to power, the Hong Kong British government has followed the aggressive policy of American imperialism and has intensified its barbaric measures of hostility towards our country and persecution of patriotic Chinese people in Hong Kong. In addition to repeatedly arresting and deporting Chinese trade union and cultural workers in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong British government has long revealed its intention to strangle the freedom of speech of our compatriots in Hong Kong. As early as last July, it implemented the so-called "Revised Publications Ordinance" to impose harsh restrictions on Chinese people's press and publishing. On March 1st this year, when people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon gathered to welcome the "Delegation from People's Organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City to Console Compatriots Affected by the Disaster in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City," the Hong Kong British government dispatched a large number of military police to massacre Chinese people in a planned and deliberate manner. This incident aroused the public outrage of the entire Chinese people, and the "People's Daily" in Beijing published a short commentary on March 4th entitled "Protest Against British Imperialism's Killing of Our Residents in Hong Kong" to express its protest. No one can deny that these three Chinese people's newspapers, "Ta Kung Pao," "Wen Wei Po," and "New Evening News," had the right to publish this short commentary. However, unexpectedly, the Hong Kong British government filed a lawsuit against the three newspapers on the trumped-up charge of publishing so-called "inflammatory text" in violation of the so-called "Sedition Ordinance," and arrested Fei Yimin, Mei Wending, Li Zongying, Li Zisong and others, the responsible persons of the three newspapers, on March 20th, 21st, and 24th. They were only temporarily released on "bail" after paying a deposit of HK$10,000 to HK$20,000. On April 16th, the Hong Kong British government illegally "tried" Fei Yimin, the publisher of Ta Kung Pao, and Li Zongying, the editor. However, the 15-day trial fully exposed to the people of Hong Kong and the world that this series of arrests, prosecutions, and trials by the Hong Kong British government was completely unreasonable and illegal.

As the defendants' lawyers pointed out, the Hong Kong British government's Department of Justice did not even obtain the necessary approval from the Hong Kong High Court before prosecuting and arresting the defendants. Even Hutton, the Hong Kong British government lawyer representing the plaintiff, had to admit that the lawsuit "had procedural irregularities." The judge finally had to use brute force to declare that he refused the defendant's lawyers' request to stop the proceedings.

Throughout the trial, the Hong Kong British government tried every means to add the charge of "inciting rebellion" to "Ta Kung Pao." However, the defendants solemnly pointed out that the "People's Daily's" short commentary was a protest and did not contain any "incitement." Even Peng De, the chairman of the Hong Kong British government's Municipal Health Bureau, who was a witness for the prosecution, said that he "did not see anything in the short commentary that would incite violence." In order to deliberately frame the case, the Hong Kong British government deliberately distorted and exaggerated the short commentary when it was translated into English, attempting to artificially create grounds for conviction. However, even another witness for the prosecution, Chen Guoying, the chief translator of the Hong Kong High Court, who originally claimed to be the translator of the short commentary, admitted that there were three errors in the translation. In the end, Chen Guoying even had to admit that he had not translated the short commentary at all.

Of course, all this is not just a farce. It also clearly proves that the Hong Kong British government, at the instigation of American imperialism, is disregarding the repeated protests of the Chinese people and government and is妄想变本加厉地推行其与中国人民为敌的政策，推行变香港为美国侵华基地的政策。（thinking wildly to intensify its policy of antagonizing the Chinese people and promoting the policy of turning Hong Kong into a base for American aggression against China). It is precisely for this reason that the Hong Kong British government, at all costs, used utterly rogue tactics, fabricated false charges, violated judicial norms, and made barbaric judgments to deprive our compatriots in Hong Kong of the right to freely hear the opinions of the people of the motherland and express their own opinions.

Now, the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" has been forced to suspend publication. The Hong Kong British government's trial of "Wen Wei Po" and "New Evening News" and other conspiracies are being prepared. The people of Guangzhou and all of China are closely watching the development of the situation. They believe that this is a serious act of hostility by Britain against the People's Republic of China, and the British government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences it causes.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: Following the violent expulsion of our compatriots Qian Jianqiang and ten others on April 25th, the Hong Kong British government successively deported our compatriots Yuan Xiangtao and eighteen others on May 2nd, 5th, and 6th. The vast number of citizens in Guangzhou are witnessing the increasingly frantic persecution of our compatriots by British imperialism in Hong Kong, and their indignation is constantly rising.

Among the eighteen compatriots who were recently deported, Yuan Xiangtao, chairman of the Hong Kong British Government Military Hospital Chinese Staff Union, and workers Zeng Weiguang, Li Tai, Yang Song, and Lai Yuan were arrested without reason by British police at around 4:00 a.m. on the 5th and escorted out of Hong Kong. Huang He, deputy director of the Welfare Department of the Hong Kong British Government Military Hospital Chinese Staff Union, was abducted into a car by plainclothes detectives like a kidnapping on his way home after going to the British Police Station to inquire about the reason for Yuan Xiangtao's arrest on the afternoon of the 6th and then deported. They were repeatedly beaten and insulted by British military police during their detention. Lai Yuan was severely beaten, resulting in six injuries to his chest, waist, and wrists.

The twelve people deported on May 2nd, workers Chen Guoxiong, Chen Lexin, Chen Yingqin, Liu Tianzan, Luo Shengyuan, Xiao Junyao, and those deported on May 6th, Wen Guanghui, Zhou Zongjin, Qian Zaiyun, Dong Xiuye, and students Tan Qianyong and Lin Huizhong, were among those arrested in the bloody atrocity of the Hong Kong British government's planned and deliberate massacre of our compatriots on March 1st. They were thrown into hard labor prisons for penal labor and recently completed their sentences. However, the Hong Kong British government was still not satisfied and escorted them to Lo Wu in prison cars and deported them.

Now, all eighteen persecuted compatriots have safely arrived in Guangzhou and have been warmly welcomed, consoled, and cared for by people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City. The compatriots who were beaten and injured by the British police have also received medical treatment.

    英帝国主义变本加厉推行敌视我国人民的政策
    香港英政府非法迫害香港大公报和我居民
    【新华社广州七日电】香港英国政府在最近接连做出了一连串迫害直至捕杀我爱国同胞的暴行以后，又于五月五日无理地下令我国人民的报纸“大公报”停刊六个月，并非法判处该报所有人兼督印人费彝民徒刑九个月或罚款港币四千元，该报编辑李宗瀛苦工六个月或罚款港币三千元；并勒令费、李两人分别缴付一千五百元与一千元港币的所谓“堂费”。这一事件是英帝国主义者对中国人民的又一次挑衅行动。
    自从邱吉尔内阁登台以来，香港英国政府就追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，变本加厉地采取仇视我国、迫害香港我国爱国人民的野蛮措施。香港英国政府除一再大批逮捕并放逐香港的中国工会工作者与文化工作者外，早就暴露出它绞杀在香港的我国同胞言论自由的意图。早在去年七月，它曾实施了所谓“充实出版物管制条例”，对中国人民的新闻出版事业加以苛刻的限制。今年三月一日，香港英国政府乘香港、九龙各界人民齐集欢迎“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团”的时机，出动大批军警，有计划、有布置地屠杀中国人民。这一事件曾引起了全中国人民的公愤，北京“人民日报”为此于三月四日以“抗议英帝国主义捕杀香港的我国居民”为题发表短评表示抗议。三月五日，香港的“大公报”、“文汇报”、“新晚报”三家报纸刊出了由本社播发的这篇短评。任何人都不能否认这三家中国人民的报纸有刊登这篇短评的权利。但是，不料香港英国政府竟以刊载所谓“煽动性文字”违反所谓“煽动条例”的莫须有罪名，向三报提出控诉，并于三月二十、二十一、二十四三日先后将三报负责人费彝民、梅文鼎、李宗瀛、李子诵等十人加以逮捕。他们只是在缴纳了港币一万元到两万元的保金后，才暂获出外“候审”。四月十六日，香港英国政府更对大公报督印人费彝民、编辑李宗瀛非法进行“审讯”。但是，连续十五日的审讯，在香港和全世界人民面前充分揭露了香港英国政府这一连串逮捕、起诉与审讯是完全无理的、非法的。
    正如被告的辩护律师指出，香港英国政府律政司在控诉与逮捕被告以前，甚至没有得到香港高等法院必要的批准手续。连代表起诉人方面的香港英国政府律师胡顿也不得不承认这次诉讼“有不合程序之处”。法官最后只得使用蛮横手段宣布拒绝被告辩护律师关于停止诉讼进行的请求。
    在整个审讯过程中，香港英国政府曾想尽办法，企图给“大公报”加上“煽动叛乱”的罪状。但是被告严正地指出，“人民日报”的短评乃是一个抗议，并没有什么“煽动”。甚至起诉方面的作证人、香港英国政府市政卫生局主席彭德都表示他在这篇短评中“看不到有任何激起暴力之处”。香港英国政府为了蓄意构陷，曾在翻译成英文时把那篇短评故意歪曲夸大，企图人为地制造定罪的根据，但是甚至起诉方面的另一个作证人、原称是短评的译者、香港高等法院首席翻译陈国英也承认译文有三处错误，最后陈国英甚至不得不承认自己根本没有译过这篇短评。
    当然，这一切并不仅仅是一幕笑剧，它也明白地证实了香港英国政府在美帝国主义的唆使下，正不顾中国人民与政府的一再抗议而妄想变本加厉地推行其与中国人民为敌的政策，推行变香港为美国侵华基地的政策。正是因为如此，香港英国政府才不惜以十足无赖的手段，捏造虚假的罪名，违反司法的常规，作出野蛮的判决，来剥夺在香港的我国同胞自由听取祖国人民言论并发表自己的言论的权利。
    现在，香港“大公报”已被迫停刊。香港英国政府对“文汇报”与“新晚报”的审讯以及其他的各种阴谋正在准备中。广州和全中国的人民正在密切注意事态的发展，他们认为这是英国对中华人民共和国严重的敌意行为，英国政府必须对它所引起的一切后果负完全责任。
    【新华社广州九日电】香港英国政府继四月二十五日横暴驱逐我国同胞钱健强等十人出境之后，又于五月二日、五日、六日接连将我国同胞袁香涛等十八人递解出境。广州广大市民看到香港英帝国主义对我国同胞的迫害愈趋疯狂，愤慨情绪正不断高涨。
    在最近被递解出境的十八位我国同胞中，香港英国政府军部医院华员职工会主席袁香涛与工人曾伟光、李泰、杨松、赖垣等五人是在五日清晨四时许，被英国警察无理逮捕后押离香港的。香港英国政府军部医院华员职工会福利部副主任黄河是在六日下午赴英方警务处询问袁香涛被捕原因后回家途中，横遭便衣警探像绑票一样地架上汽车后驱逐出境的。他们在被拘押期间曾受到英国军警多次殴打和侮辱，其中赖垣被毒打致胸部、腰部和手腕等六处受伤。
    在五月二日被递解出境的工人陈国雄、陈乐新、陈应勤、刘天赞、骆胜圆、萧俊耀以及在五月六日被递解出境的文广辉、周宗进、钱在鋆、董修业、学生谭乾勇、林辉中等十二人，是三月一日香港英国政府有计划、有布置地屠杀我国同胞的血腥暴行中的被捕者。他们被投入苦工监罚作劳役，最近受刑期满。但是，香港英国政府还不甘心，又把他们囚车押解至罗湖，驱逐出境。
    现在，十八位被迫害的同胞已全部安抵广州，受到广东省、广州市各人民团体热情的欢迎、慰问和照顾。被英警毒打成伤的同胞亦已获医疗。
