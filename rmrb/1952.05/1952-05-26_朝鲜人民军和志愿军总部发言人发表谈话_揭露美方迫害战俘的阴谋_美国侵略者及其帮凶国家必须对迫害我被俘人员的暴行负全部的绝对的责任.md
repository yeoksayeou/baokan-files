Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 25th: On May 23rd, Clark, the commander-in-chief of the invading U.S. forces in Korea, openly clamored that he had ordered the U.S. military in the Busan and Geoje Island POW camps to use "concussion grenades," "tear gas grenades," and "riot control tactics." Enemy news reports openly declared that the U.S. military on Geoje Island was conducting bayonet drills and releasing poisonous gas against the prisoners of war. Our reporter interviewed the spokesperson of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters on this matter, and received the following statement:

Since February 18th of this year, in order to force our captured personnel to abandon their right to be repatriated home after the armistice and accept their forced screening, the U.S. side has carried out several massacres against our captured personnel, resulting in 391 casualties. Enemy news agencies reported on May 24th that on April 10th of this year, the U.S. side carried out another massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island, resulting in 60 casualties. In early May, under the just resistance of our captured personnel, the then commander of the U.S. POW camp guaranteed that "violent actions and bloodshed would no longer occur" and guaranteed that there would be no more "forced screening or any rearmament actions." However, the U.S. side flagrantly overturned this guarantee and further intensified the persecution of our captured personnel. On May 20th, the U.S. military carried out another bloody massacre in the Busan POW camp in order to force screening, resulting in 86 casualties. Enemy news reports revealed that prior to the massacre in the Busan POW camp, the U.S. side had stopped providing food to our captured personnel since May 12th in order to force screening. Because this inhuman and illegal behavior could not shake the firm will of our captured personnel to demand repatriation, the beastly American aggressor troops further adopted the means of mass murder. Our side has lodged serious protests at the armistice negotiation meetings regarding the U.S. side's repeated massacre atrocities, but the U.S. side not only refused to make any response, but its responsible personnel even more openly stepped up arrangements for the persecution and massacre of our captured personnel. U.S. Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet personally went to Geoje Island three times to arrange suppression measures. A large number of troops and flamethrower tanks that the U.S. side sent to Geoje Island and Busan have already begun to operate, and more troops are being dispatched. Clark's statement on May 23rd is a further public exposure of these conspiracies and cannot but arouse the serious attention of the people of the world. Our captured personnel demand humane treatment and the right to return home after the armistice to live a peaceful life. Their opposition to the U.S. side's inhumane treatment and barbaric forced screening is completely just. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fully support their just demands and will fight to the end for their sacred right to return home after the armistice to live a peaceful life. The U.S. aggressors and their accomplice nations must bear full and absolute responsibility for the cruel atrocities of persecuting our captured personnel.

    朝鲜人民军和志愿军总部发言人发表谈话
    揭露美方迫害战俘的阴谋
    美国侵略者及其帮凶国家必须对迫害我被俘人员的暴行负全部的绝对的责任
    【新华社开城二十五日电】五月二十三日侵朝美军总司令克拉克公开叫嚣他已下令釜山和巨济岛战俘营的美军使用“震荡手榴弹”、“催泪毒气弹”及“镇压暴动的战术”。敌方新闻报道公开宣称：巨济岛上的美军面对着战俘进行劈刺和施放毒气的演习。记者特就此事访问朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军总部发言人，承发表谈话如下：
    今年二月十八日以来，美方为了强使我方被俘人员放弃停战后遣返回家的权利而接受其强迫甄别，曾数次对我方被俘人员进行屠杀，伤亡我被俘人员三九一名。敌方通讯社在五月二十四日报道称，今年四月十日美方更曾在巨济岛另一次屠杀我方被俘人员，伤亡达六十人。五月上旬在我方被俘人员正义反抗下，美方当时战俘营长官保证“使暴力行动与流血事件不再发生”，并保证不再“进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动。”但美方悍然推翻了这一保证，更进一步地加紧迫害我方被俘人员。五月二十日美军在釜山战俘营为强迫甄别，再次施行血腥屠杀，伤亡我被俘人员八十六名。敌方新闻报道透露在釜山战俘营屠杀血案之前，美方为强迫进行甄别，曾在五月十二日起，停止我方被俘人员的伙食。由于这种灭绝人性的非法行为丝毫不能动摇我方被俘人员要求遣返的坚决意志，野兽一般的美国侵略军就更进一步地采取了成批屠杀的手段。对于美方迭次的屠杀暴行，我方曾在停战谈判会议上提出严重抗议，而美方不但拒绝作任何答复，其负责人员反更公开加紧布置对我方被俘人员的迫害与屠杀。美军第八军军长范佛里特三次亲赴巨济岛布置镇压措施，美方增派到巨济岛和釜山的大量部队和喷火坦克等已开始活动，而更多的部队则正在调派中。五月二十三日克拉克的谈话是这些阴谋活动的更进一步的公开化，不能不引起全世界人民的严重注意。我方被俘人员要求人道待遇和在停战后遣返回家过和平生活的权利。他们反对美方的非人道待遇和野蛮的强迫甄别是完全合乎正义的。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军完全支持他们的正义要求，并将为他们停战后回家过和平生活的神圣权利斗争到底。美国侵略者及其帮凶国家必须对迫害我方被俘人员的残酷暴行负全部的绝对的责任。
