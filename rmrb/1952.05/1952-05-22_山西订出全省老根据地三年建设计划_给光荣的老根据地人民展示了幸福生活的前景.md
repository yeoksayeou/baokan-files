Shanxi Province People's Government, based on the State Council's directive on strengthening work in old revolutionary base areas and the province's actual conditions, has formulated a three-year construction work plan for the province's old base areas. This plan sets clear goals for the construction work in the old base areas of Shanxi Province, presenting the people of the glorious old base areas, who have long persisted in revolutionary struggle, with the prospect of a happy life.

The old revolutionary base areas of Shanxi Province cover a wide area, including twenty-two complete counties and the majority of forty-nine counties (including the Shanxi portions of the original Jin-Cha-Ji, Jin-Sui, Lüliang, Taihang, and Taiyue areas). The population is over 5,629,000, accounting for 50% of the province's total population. Most of the old base areas are mountainous, with infertile land. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the level of production was very low. Furthermore, due to severe damage inflicted by the enemy and puppet regime during the long years of war, the people's lives in these areas are very difficult. The plan formulated by the Shanxi Province People's Government is based on the principle of combining improving the current lives of the people in the old base areas with long-term construction. It requires fundamentally changing the face of all old base areas in the province within three years, making every corner of the old base areas a place of abundance, prosperity, convenient transportation, and developed culture. The plan requires organizing all labor power in the old base areas within three years, comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, increasing agricultural income by 30% to 40%, and total income by 60% to 100%. The plan also specifically proposes the standards that must be achieved in various tasks in 1952.

In terms of developing agricultural production, the plan requires improving agricultural cultivation methods to increase yield per unit area. It aims to achieve the following: in 1952, increase the total value of land income per household by more than 15% of last year's total income; within three years, increase agricultural income by 40% in the poorest areas and 30% in general areas. To this end, the plan requires the five special districts of Xing County, Xin County, Changzhi, Yuci, and Linfen to convert 600,000 mu of slopes into terraced fields this year. Among them, the mountainous areas of Xin County and Xing County should convert 2,000,000 mu of slopes into terraced fields within three years (averaging five mu per household) to conserve water, improve mountain soil, and increase yields. To ensure increased yields, the plan requires supplementing 400,000 pieces of old-style plows, harrows, and other large farm tools this year, with an average of one piece added for every three households; within three years, there should be no shortage of old-style farm tools, and there should also be new-style farm tools. The plan also requires vigorously developing water conservancy, ensuring the opening of canals, digging of wells, river management, and water storage in 1952, expanding the irrigated area by 114,000 mu, and expanding the irrigated area by 600,000 mu within three years.

In terms of developing forestry, the plan requires achieving "forests on every mountain, trees in every village" within three years. The specific requirements are: sowing seeds on 160,000 mu of barren mountains in 1952, transplanting wild seedlings for afforestation on 22,000 mu, and replanting 15,000 mu; reaching a total of 594,000 mu of various types of afforestation within three years. In terms of developing animal husbandry, the focus is on developing cattle, donkeys, horses, and sheep, striving to ensure that within three years, each household in the old base areas' pastoral areas has one head of breeding livestock, one fat pig, one breeding sheep, and one hen per person. To strengthen the prevention and control of animal diseases, the plan requires the construction of 196 new veterinary stations in 1952, training 2,000 veterinarians, and ensuring that within three years there is one veterinarian for every 300 livestock and one person in five villages to prevent and control swine, chicken, and sheep plagues. In terms of restoring and opening up transportation in the old base areas, the plan requires building 2,298 kilometers of highways within three years; at the same time, it requires repairing all cart roads, pack mule roads, pedestrian paths, and riverbed roads to ensure that transportation in the old base areas is unimpeded. In order to establish and expand the commercial and cooperative trade network in the old base areas and change the stagnant state of material exchange in the old base areas, the plan requires adding 6,000 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and 1,000 supply and marketing stations within three years, developing 1.4 million members, and striving to have all people over the age of fifteen join the cooperatives. In terms of strengthening cultural education, health and epidemic prevention, and preferential treatment work in the old base areas, the plan requires establishing a health center in each county in 1952; this year, 45 county maternal and child health stations and 1,500 village delivery stations will be established in the old base areas of the province; within three years, counties with a better economic foundation will establish a health clinic and a maternal and child health station in each district. Within three years, each county will have a middle school, and each district will have two or three complete primary schools, and vigorously develop farmers' spare-time schools, eliminating illiteracy among all district and village cadres and eliminating one-third to two-thirds of the illiteracy among general youth and adults within three years. In strengthening preferential treatment work, the focus is on strengthening land tilling assistance, ensuring that the land of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary servicemen's families without labor is farmed on their behalf, guaranteeing that their yields reach or approach the yields of ordinary farmers' land.

In order to effectively guarantee the implementation of various economic construction tasks in the old base areas, the above plan stipulates that the Shanxi Provincial National Bank should vigorously issue various loans, and specifically stipulates that 35 billion yuan should be issued in 1952, including 10 billion yuan for animal husbandry loans, 4 billion yuan for water conservancy loans, 3 billion yuan for cotton field loans, 3 billion yuan for mining, handicrafts, sideline occupations, and agricultural tool loans, and 15 billion yuan for housing loans.

    山西订出全省老根据地三年建设计划
    给光荣的老根据地人民展示了幸福生活的前景
    山西省人民政府根据政务院关于加强老根据地工作的指示和该省实际情况，订出了全省老根据地三年建设工作计划。这个计划，给山西省老根据地的建设工作，提出了明确的奋斗目标，为长期坚持革命斗争的光荣的老根据地人民，展现了幸福生活的前景。
    山西省老根据地面积很广，共有二十二个整县和四十九个县的大部分（包括原晋察冀、晋绥、吕梁、太行和太岳区的山西部分等）。人口有五百六十二万九千多，占全省总人口的百分之五十。老根据地大部是山区，土地贫瘠，抗战以前生产水平就很低，加以在长期的战争环境中，遭受敌伪的严重破坏，因此这些地区的人民生活很艰苦。山西省人民政府这次制订的这个计划，就是依据改善老根据地人民的当前生活和长期建设相结合的方针，要求在三年之内，根本改变全省老根据地的面貌，使老根据地的每一个角落都成为丰衣足食、人财两旺、交通便利、文化发达的地方。计划要求在三年之内，将老根据地全部劳动力组织起来，全面发展农业、林业、畜牧业和副业，使农业收入增加百分之三十至四十，总收入增加百分之六十到一倍。这个计划并具体提出了一九五二年度各项工作所必须达到的标准。
    在发展农业生产方面，计划要求改进农业耕作方法，提高单位面积产量；做到：一九五二年每户增加土地收入总值超过去年总收入的百分之十五；三年内最贫苦的地区农业收入增加百分之四十，一般地区农业收入增加百分之三十。为此，该计划要求兴县、忻县、长治、榆次、临汾等五个专区在今年将坡地改修梯田六十万亩，其中忻县、兴县两专区山地，三年内应改修梯田二百万亩（平均每户改修五亩），以达到保存水分、改良山地土壤，提高产量的目的。为了保证提高产量，计划要求今年补充旧式犁、耙等大农具四十万件，平均每三户添置一件；三年内做到不缺少旧式农具也有新式农具。该计划同时要求大力兴修水利，在一九五二年，保证开渠、打井、治河、蓄水，扩大灌溉面积十一万四千亩，三年内，扩大灌溉面积六十万亩。
    发展林业方面，该计划要求在三年内作到“山山有林、村村有树”，具体要求：在一九五二年播种荒山十六万亩，移植野生苗造林二万二千亩，补植
    一万五千亩；三年内达到各种造林五十九万四千亩。发展畜牧业方面，以发展牛、驴、马、羊为重点，争取在三年内，老根据地畜牧区每户有一头母畜、一口肥猪，每人有一只母羊、一只母鸡。为了加强畜疫防治，计划要求一九五二年新建兽医站一百九十六个，训练兽医二千名，在三年内作到三百个牲畜有一个兽医，五个村有一个防治猪、鸡、羊瘟疫的人。在恢复和开辟老根据地交通方面，计划要求在三年内，修公路二千二百九十八公里；同时要求修好所有的大车路、驮骡路、人行道、河滩道，使老根据地交通畅通无阻。为了建立和扩大老根据地的商业、合作贸易网、改变老根据地物资交流的停滞状态，计划要求在三年内增设基层供销社六千个，供销站一千个，发展社员一百四十万人，争取十五岁以上的人全部入社。在加强老根据地文化教育、卫生防疫和优抚工作方面，计划要求一九五二年每县建立一个卫生院；全省老根据地今年要建立四十五个县妇婴保健站和一千五百个村接生站；在三年之内，经济基础较好的县份，每个区建立一个卫生所，一个妇婴保健站。三年内每县有一所中学，每一个区有两三个完全小学，并大力发展农民业余学校，在三年内扫除区村干部中的全体文盲和扫除一般青年、壮年文盲的三分之一至三分之二。在加强优抚工作方面，重点是加强代耕工作，对无劳力的革命烈士和革命军人家属的土地作到包产代耕，保证其产量达到或接近一般农民的土地的产量。
    为了切实保证老根据地各项经济建设工作的进行，上述计划规定，山西省国家银行应大力发放各种贷款，并具体规定，在一九五二年发放三百五十亿元，其中畜牧贷款一百亿元，水利贷款四十亿元，棉田贷款三十亿元，矿业、手工业、副业、农具等贷款三十亿元，房舍贷款一百五十亿元。
