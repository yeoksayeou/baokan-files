    Newspapers and Periodicals in Various Places Should Comply with the Specification of Arranging Horizontal Text from Left to Right
    Since the People's Daily published Lü Shuxiang and Zhu Dexi's "Lectures on Grammar and Rhetoric," most newspapers and periodicals in various places have complied with the specification of arranging horizontal text from left to right when publishing horizontal text. However, some newspapers and periodicals have not paid attention to this. For example, the mastheads of the Fujian Daily, Shanghai Xinmin Evening News, as well as the magazines "Outlook" and "Northern Jiangsu Literature and Art," still arrange the text from right to left. In addition, some newspaper headlines, such as the horizontal headline on the first page of the Northeast Daily on May 1st, "Long Live May Day International Labor Day," the horizontal headline on the sixth page of the Changjiang Daily on May 1st, "Celebrating 'May Day' International Labor Day," and the arrangement of the four lines of horizontal text on the first page of the Tianjin Daily on May 1st, are also from right to left. I believe that this chaotic phenomenon in the arrangement of horizontal text should be corrected.

    各地报刊登载横行文字时应遵守从左往右排列的规格
    从人民日报发表吕叔湘、朱德熙所作“语法、修辞讲话”后，各地报刊在刊登横行文字时，大半已遵守从左往右的规格。可是，仍有一部分报刊对此未加注意。例如福建日报、上海新民报晚刊、以及展望杂志、苏北文艺杂志的报头和刊头，文字的排列依旧是从右到左。另外还有些报纸上的标题，如五月一日东北日报一版的横题“五一劳动节万岁”、五月一日长江日报六版的横题“庆祝‘五一’国际劳动节”和五月一日天津日报一版的四行横题文字的排列，也都是从右到左。我认为，这种横行文字排列上的混乱现象，是应当加以纠正的。
