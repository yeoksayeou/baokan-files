Their visit to Beijing was warmly received by the central leaders and enthusiastically welcomed by people from all walks of life. They witnessed the great achievements of the motherland in political, economic, and cultural fields, unanimously recognized the greatness and lovability of the motherland, and further enhanced their patriotic enthusiasm.

On the eve of their departure from Beijing, the three ethnic minority visiting delegations wrote a letter to Premier Zhou to express their respect. The letter stated: The great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have liberated us, allowing us to enjoy the rights of national equality; freedom of religious belief and customs have been respected. During our visit, we have been warmly welcomed and sincerely helped everywhere, which made us feel indescribably warm and appreciate the happiness of living in the great motherland—the family of all ethnic groups. We will convey all this to the people of all ethnic groups, so that they will faithfully unite closely under the banner of Chairman Mao, work hard to produce, and defend national defense. We will promote patriotism, resolutely expel imperialist forces, eliminate reactionaries, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan quickly to repay Chairman Mao and your kindness to us.
