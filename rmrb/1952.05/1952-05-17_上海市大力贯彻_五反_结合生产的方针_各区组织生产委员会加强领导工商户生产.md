    Shanghai Vigorously Implements the Policy of "Five-Anti" Combined with Production; Production Committees Organized in Various Districts to Strengthen Leadership of Industrial and Commercial Businesses
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy vigorously implements the policy of "Five-Anti" combined with production. In the later stages of the "Five-Anti" movement, production committees were established in various districts to strengthen leadership of the production work of industrial and commercial businesses that had been investigated and finalized. Many private enterprises facing difficulties have resumed and developed production with the support of the People's Government through processing orders and purchasing finished products.
    "Five-Anti" combined with production is a successful experience of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" movement. Throughout the entire movement, private factories and shops generally maintained production. After the basic victory of the "Five-Anti" movement, the Municipal Committee for Increasing Production and Practicing Economy further strengthened its leadership in production work. In addition to providing general education to "Five-Anti" staff in various districts, a Processing and Ordering Committee was first established in the city to expand processing and ordering business with private enterprises. At the same time, production committees were established in various districts, deploying a large number of cadres to systematically lead and help private enterprises overcome difficulties and improve production.
    Under this policy, the production committees in various districts first organized forces to conduct in-depth investigations and research in various private factories, and then strengthened leadership and provided specific assistance according to the specific circumstances of each business. For factories with normal production, workers were mobilized to unite with capitalists to further improve production. For example, workers in many factories such as Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9 and Baofuji Steel Construction Factory urged capitalists to formulate comprehensive plans to improve management and develop production. The workers also launched labor competitions based on these plans, resulting in continuous increases in output. For factories with production difficulties, the district production committees provided assistance based on their production nature and difficulties. For industries closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, the People's Government entrusted them with processing, ordering, or purchasing finished products to help them quickly resume production. For example, Yongxin Raincoat Factory had better equipment and product quality, but production was affected due to lack of funds. The production committee put forward specific opinions, and with the approval of the Municipal Processing and Ordering Committee, the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China provided loans of 1.34 billion yuan to help the factory solve its difficulties. The Jiangnan Paper Mill had originally stopped production, but with the approval of the Municipal Processing and Ordering Committee at the request of the production committee, the China Department Store, East China Branch, placed an order with the factory, enabling it to resume production. Even factories with serious illegal acts in the past were taken care of by the People's Government as long as they had development prospects. For example, the People's Government also provided loans and processing orders to Merlin Canned Food Company and Dalong Iron Factory to enable them to continue production. As for some industries and shops that had no development prospects and were bound to be eliminated, they were educated to change careers. In order to guide private enterprises to engage in legitimate operations, the production committees in various districts mobilized workers to establish some necessary organizations and systems to supervise capitalists from no longer cutting corners and producing shoddy goods, ensuring that special funds were used for special purposes and improving production. In the course of work, the production committees also corrected the negative attitude of state-owned enterprise staff towards processing orders from private enterprises, and the views of a few cadres who unconditionally took care of private enterprises.
    The People's Government's support for private enterprises has enabled most of the originally troubled private enterprises to resume production. For example, among the large factories in the hardware, textile, light industry, and chemical industries in Xuhui District, the original number of fully and partially suspended factories was thirty-three. With the assistance of the People's Government in processing orders, purchasing finished products, and providing loans, etc., up to now, except for a very few that are seasonal or not needed for the national economy and people's livelihood, most have resumed production and are gradually embarking on a path of normal development.
    The process of the People's Government leading and helping private enterprises to resume production is also the process of educating capitalists, making them further realize that the "Five-Anti" movement is for improving production, thereby enhancing their confidence in management. For example, the capitalist of Maoli Woolen Mill stopped production during the "Five-Anti" movement under the pretext of lack of raw materials, but under the encouragement of the People's Government's vigorous resumption of production and the workers' initiative to unite and supervise, he realized that under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, production had prospects, so he shipped the long fleece worth 2 billion yuan originally stored in Hong Kong back to Shanghai to continue production. The factory is also repairing previously unused weaving machines in preparation for weaving cloth. The capitalist of Merlin Canned Food Company has increased capital by 800 million yuan and is determined to improve production. The capitalist of Tianzhong Chemical Factory is also actively expanding production. He bought a large boiler, which is being installed. After installation, production can be doubled.

### 上海市大力贯彻“五反”结合生产的方针  各区组织生产委员会加强领导工商户生产

    上海市大力贯彻“五反”结合生产的方针
    各区组织生产委员会加强领导工商户生产
    上海市增产节约委员会大力贯彻“五反”结合生产的方针，各区都在“五反”运动的后期建立了生产委员会，加强领导已经审查定案的工商户的生产工作。很多有困难的私营企业，已在人民政府加工定货、收购成品的扶助下，恢复和发展了生产。
    “五反”结合生产，是上海市“五反”运动的成功经验。在整个运动中，各私营工厂商店一般都维持了生产。在“五反”运动取得基本胜利之后，市增产节约委员会更加强对于生产工作的领导。除对各区“五反”工作人员普遍进行了教育外，首先在市建立了加工定货委员会，以扩大对私营企业的加工定货业务。同时在各区建立了生产委员会，调配了大批干部，有计划地领导和帮助私营企业克服困难，搞好生产。
    在这一方针下，各区生产委员会首先组织力量深入各私营工厂进行调查研究，然后按照各户的具体情况加强领导和具体帮助。对生产正常的工厂，就发动职工团结资本家进一步搞好生产。如申新纺织第九厂、包福记钢铁建筑厂等很多工厂的工人，都督促资本家订出了全面的改善经营、发展生产的计划。职工们并根据这些计划开展了劳动竞赛，使得产量不断提高。对生产有困难的工厂，区生产委员会就根据它的生产性质和困难情况，分别予以帮助。凡是和国计民生关系密切的行业，人民政府就委托它们加工、定货或收购成品，帮助它们迅速恢复生产。如永新雨衣制造厂设备较好，产品质量也好，但因缺乏资金，影响生产，生产委员会就提出具体意见，经市加工定货委员会批准，由中国人民银行上海分行贷款十三亿四千万元，帮助该厂解决困难。江南造纸厂本来已经停工了，经生产委员会提请市加工定货委员会批准，中国百货公司华东区公司就向该厂定货，使该厂恢复了生产。有些虽然过去是有严重违法行为的工厂，但只要有发展前途，人民政府同样予以照顾。如梅林罐头食品公司、大隆铁工厂，人民政府也给予贷款和加工定货，使其继续生产。至于有些行业和厂店已无发展前途，势必要淘汰的，就教育他们转业。为了领导私营企业从事正当的经营，各区生产委员会都发动工人建立了一些必要的组织和制度，监督资本家不再偷工减料、粗制滥造，作到专款专用，搞好生产。在工作过程中，生产委员会也纠正了国营企业工作人员对私营企业加工定货不积极的态度，和少数干部无原则地照顾私营企业的观点。
    人民政府对私营企业的扶助，使得原来有困难的私营企业大部已恢复生产。如徐汇区五金、纺织、轻工、化工四个行业的大工厂，全部停工和半停工的原来有三十三户，经人民政府分别予以加工定货、收购成品和贷款等扶助，到目前为止，除了极少数因季节关系或不为国计民生所需者外，大都恢复了生产，并逐渐走上正常发展的道路。
    人民政府领导和帮助私营企业恢复生产的过程，也就是教育资本家的过程，使他们进一步认识了“五反”运动是为了搞好生产，因而提高了经营信心。如贸利毛纺厂的资本家在“五反”运动期间藉口缺乏原料而停工，但在人民政府大力恢复生产的鼓舞和工人主动的团结督促下，他认识了在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，生产有前途，便把原来存放在香港的价值二十亿元的长毛绒运回上海，继续生产。该厂并在修理过去不用的布机，准备织布。梅林罐头食品公司的资本家已增加八亿元资金，决心搞好生产。天中化工厂的资本家也正积极扩大生产，他买了一个大锅炉，正在安装中，装好后生产便能扩大一倍。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
