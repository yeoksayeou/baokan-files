To our beloved Chairman Mao: On this great "May Day" Labor Day, we, all employees of the Fushun Mining Bureau, report to you on the victories on the "Three-Anti" campaign, production, and the anti-bacterial warfare front.

Following your brilliant instructions, we vigorously launched the "Three-Anti" campaign. Under the leadership of the Party, this struggle is about to achieve complete victory, and our working class ranks are more pure and consolidated. In the intense "tiger-beating" struggle, we launched a red flag competition combining "tiger-beating" and production, and many factories and mines have achieved significant results. The bureau's first quarter production plan for major products has been overfulfilled, with raw coal exceeding by 5 percent and miner's lamps exceeding by 37.5 percent. In April, the enthusiasm of the employees of various factories and mines was even higher in preparation for the great May, and the oil refinery completed the production tasks from January to April ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

The preparatory work for capital construction in 1952 has been basically completed. In the design work, the designers improved the design methods and increased work efficiency. This enables the technical design of eleven major projects of Grade A to be basically completed in April, saving the state 13 billion in capital construction investment.

As we follow the direction you have guided and bravely advance towards the infinitely beautiful construction prospects of the motherland, we have not relaxed our vigilance against US imperialism in the slightest. The enemy is conducting insane bacterial warfare, spreading poisonous insects in our area. We have launched a pest control and disinfection campaign in factories, mines, and residential areas, and have eliminated the poisonous insects. Chairman Mao: The Chinese people under your leadership cannot be defeated.

The great May is coming, and we will launch a larger-scale increase production and practice economy campaign. We assure you that on the basis of consolidating existing achievements, we must achieve even greater victories.

All employees of the Fushun Mining Bureau

    报告“三反”和生产战线上的胜利
    敬爱的毛主席：在伟大的“五一”劳动节，我们抚顺矿务局全体职工向您报告“三反”、生产和反细菌战线上的胜利。
    按照您的英明的指示，我们大张旗鼓地开展了“三反”运动。在党的领导下，这一斗争即将取得完全胜利，我们工人阶级的队伍是更加纯洁和巩固了。在紧张的“打虎”斗争中，我们展开了“打虎”和生产相结合的红旗竞赛，很多厂矿取得了重大成就。全局第一季度主要产品的生产计划已超额完成了，其中如原煤超过百分之五，矿灯超过百分之三十七点五。四月份，各厂矿职工为迎接伟大的五月，情绪更形高涨，制油厂提前超额完成了一月到四月的生产任务。
    一九五二年基本建设的准备工作已基本就绪。在设计工作中，设计人员改进设计方法，提高了工作效率。这使今年十一种重大工程的甲级设计在四月份内可基本完成技术设计，给国家节省一百三十亿的基本建设投资。
    当我们循着您指导的方向，向祖国无限美好的建设前途奋勇前进的时候，我们丝毫没有对美帝国主义放松警惕。敌人进行丧心病狂的细菌战，在我们所在的地区撒布了毒虫。我们在厂矿区、住宅区展开扑虫消毒运动，已经消灭了毒虫。毛主席：您所领导的中国人民是不可能被战胜的。
    伟大的五月到来了，我们将要展开更大规模的增产节约竞赛。我们向您保证：在巩固现有成绩的基础上，我们一定要取得更大的胜利。
    抚顺矿务局全体职工
