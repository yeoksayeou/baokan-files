    Reply Regarding the Supply of Agricultural Production Materials to Farmers

    Editor: The criticism from comrades Liu Peijian and three others published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 15th, regarding our cooperative's failure to timely supply the production materials needed by farmers in Shouyang County, is very correct. This shows that we have not paid sufficient attention to production work. Although we made specific arrangements for the procurement of black alum this year and instructed the Meng County Cooperative to complete the procurement task, the Meng County Cooperative lacked in-depth investigation beforehand and failed to do a good job in organizing. In addition, private dyeing businesses from other places bought away a large portion of the black alum, resulting in eighty percent of our original procurement plan falling through, causing a general shortage across the entire district. Therefore, when we revised the plan for supplying black alum to various locations, we had to change the amount supplied to the Shouyang County Cooperative from 200,000 jin to 40,000 jin, and try our best to reach 80,000 jin. On the other hand, in order to save on transportation costs and reduce expenses, we adopted the method of supplying nearby, and therefore prioritized allocating a portion of the black alum that had been transported from Meng County to Yangquan to the more distant counties. As for the black alum needed by the Shouyang County Cooperative, we decided to introduce them to directly pick up the goods from Meng County. Before our special district cooperative made this decision, we sent cadres to Meng County to supervise and contact them, but unexpectedly, the Meng County Cooperative was still not active in this matter. Until March 12th, they could only supply the Shouyang County Cooperative with 50,000 jin of black alum. In terms of quantity, this not only failed to meet the needs of the local farmers, but also delayed the farmers' spring plowing and production. This is due to our overly mechanical work methods and failure to promptly check and supervise. Now, in addition to making a self-criticism, we will actively complete this supply task.

    山西省榆次专区供销合作社
    对供应农民生产资料问题的答复
    编辑同志：四月十五日人民日报“读者来信”栏内，登载刘培健等四位同志对我社不及时供应寿阳县农民需要的生产资料的批评，是很正确的。这说明我们对生产工作还没有足够的重视。对今年收购黑矾的准备工作，我们虽然早有具体布置，并责成盂县县社完成收购任务，但因该县社事先缺乏深入调查，又没有做好组织工作，加以外地公私染织业去买走了一大部分黑矾，致使我们原定收购计划有百分之八十落空，造成了全区普遍供不应求的现象。因此，当我们修订供给各地黑矾的计划时，不得不把供给寿阳县社的数量从二十万斤改为四万斤和尽量争取达到八万斤的数字。另一方面我们为了节省运费、降低成本，便采取了就近供给的办法，因而对已由盂县运到阳泉的一部分黑矾，我们便尽先分配远地各县。至于寿阳县社所需黑矾，我们决定介绍他们直接到盂县取货。在我们专区社还没作出这一决定之前，我们曾派干部到盂县督促和联系，不料盂县县社对这事仍不积极，直到三月十二日，还只能供应寿阳县社黑矾五万斤，在数量上不但不能满足当地农民的要求，在时间上也耽误了农民的春耕生产。这是由于我们工作方法过分机械和不及时检查、督促所致。现在我们除作检讨外，并要积极完成这一供应任务。
