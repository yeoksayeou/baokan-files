Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 14th: At today’s meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, our chief representative General Nam Il sternly denounced the inhumane treatment inflicted by the other side on our captured personnel, and the forcible so-called screening activities to manufacture so-called screening results, in an attempt to detain our captured personnel to use as cannon fodder. General Nam Il emphatically pointed out that even the commander of the other side's prisoner-of-war camp had to fully admit the other side's criminal behavior, proving to the people of the world that the other side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" was entirely the result of violent actions and forced screening. The full text of General Nam Il's speech is as follows:

    After you proposed your plan on April 28th, we proposed a completely fair and reasonable compromise counter-proposal on May 2nd. However, you have consistently adopted an unreasonable and non-negotiating barbaric attitude, refusing to engage in discussions, and simply repeating the old tune that your plan is "final, unchangeable, and irretrievable," attempting to force us to accept your unilateral and unreasonable plan. I must reiterate that this barbaric and threatening attitude of yours, which is deliberately delaying and even sabotaging the negotiations, will not have any impact on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, but can only indicate that you have no sincerity in reaching an agreement on the issue of prisoners of war and achieving a Korean armistice. Based on our consistent stance of striving for a Korean armistice, and based on undeniable facts and clear logic, we explain our reasonable compromise plan and oppose your unilateral and unreasonable demands. Unless you explicitly declare that you are determined to sabotage the armistice negotiations, we will continue to insist on the normal progress of the meeting, and continue to explain our plan and refute your demands at this meeting based on facts and logic. The undeniable fact is that you have inflicted various inhumane treatments on our captured personnel and taken various violent measures. Among our captured personnel, you have forcibly carried out the so-called screening activities which are fundamentally unacceptable, in order to create your so-called screening results. In your prisoner-of-war camp负责人(fù zé rén)'s response regarding the Dodd incident involving our captured personnel, he openly admitted that your prisoner-of-war camp "had incidents of bloodshed, resulting in many prisoners of war being killed or injured by the United Nations forces. I can offer you assurances that the prisoners of war in this camp can expect to receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law. I am willing to do everything in my power to prevent violent actions and bloodshed from happening again." Your prisoner-of-war camp负责人(fù zé rén) also allowed "we will no longer conduct forced screening or any rearmament actions on the prisoners of war in this prisoner-of-war camp." Your prisoner-of-war camp负责人(fù zé rén)'s responsible reply openly admitted the treatment of prisoners of war that does not conform to international public law and violates the Geneva Convention, admitted the existence of violent acts, and admitted the existence of forced screening, completely confirming to the people of the world the ironclad fact: your so-called "voluntary repatriation" is entirely the result of violent actions and forced screening. This is a fundamental and inescapable fact. Yesterday, you even called your so-called plan of April 28th, which is the final, unchangeable, and irretrievable argument, a fundamental and inescapable fact. However, your repeated unreasonable arguments do not represent any facts, but only show that you have not yet reached an agreement on the issue of prisoners of war in order to achieve a Korean armistice. The final, unchangeable, and irretrievable fact is the firm resistance of our captured personnel to your inhumane treatment, the just struggle of our captured personnel against your forced screening, and your attempt to detain our captured personnel to use as cannon fodder, which you will never be able to realize. You claim that making the facts public will not help the agreement, but will only prove the differences between the two sides. Facts cannot be concealed or erased. The reason why differences exist between the two sides and the agreement cannot be reached is not due to the disclosure of facts, but due to your unreasonable and non-negotiating barbaric attitude and your insistence on your unilateral and unreasonable plan. In order to reach an agreement and achieve an armistice, you must change your unreasonable and non-negotiating barbaric attitude, abandon your attempt to detain our captured personnel, and immediately conduct discussions and solve the problem on the basis of our May 2nd plan.

    美方强迫进行甄别企图扣留我被俘人员
    南日将军痛斥美方罪行
    严词指出美方所谓“自愿遣返”是暴力行动和强迫甄别的结果
    【新华社开城十四日电】十四日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军痛斥对方对我方被俘人员施用非人道的待遇，强迫进行所谓甄别以制造所谓甄别结果，企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰。南日将军严词指出对方俘虏营营长也不得不完全承认对方的罪恶行为，向全世界人民证实了对方所谓“自愿遣返”完全是暴力行动和强迫甄别的结果。南日将军发言全文如下：
    四月二十八日你方提出方案后，我方在五月二日已经提出了完全公平合理的折衷对案。但你方却始终采取了不讲理不协商的蛮横态度，拒绝进行讨论，而一味重复你方方案是“最后的不可更改的不可挽回的”的老调，企图借此强使我方接受你方片面无理的方案。我必须再次指出，你方这种蓄意拖延乃至破坏谈判的蛮横威胁态度，对于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军并不能产生任何的影响，而只能表示你方并无对战俘问题达成协议、实现朝鲜停战的诚意。我方本着我方一贯争取朝鲜停战的立场，根据不容否认的事实和清楚明白的逻辑，来说明我方合理折衷的方案，反对你方片面无理的主张。除非你方明白公开地声明你方决意破坏停战谈判，我方将继续坚持会议的正常进行，继续在这一会议上根据事实与逻辑，说明我方的方案，驳复你方的主张。不容否认的事实是，你方对我方被俘人员施行各种非人道的待遇，采取各种强暴手段，在我方被俘人员中，强迫进行根本不能容许的所谓甄别活动，以制造你方的所谓甄别结果。你方俘虏营负责人关于杜德事件对我方被俘人员的答复中，公开承认你方俘虏营“有过流血事件发生，结果有许多战俘被联合国军队打死或击伤。我可以向你们提出保证，望告这个俘虏营里的战俘，可以希望得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇。我愿尽自己的一切力量，使暴力行动和流血事件不再发生”。你方俘虏营负责人并允许“我们不再对这个战俘营里的战俘，进行强迫甄别或任何重新武装的行动”。你方俘虏营负责人的负责答复公开地承认了对战俘的不符合国际公法，违反日内瓦公约的待遇，承认了有暴力行为，承认了有强迫甄别，向全世界人民完全地证实了铁一般的事实：你方所谓“自愿遣返”完全是暴力行动和强迫甄别的结果。这是基本的不容逃避的事实。你方昨日竟然将所谓你方四月二十八日的方案是最后的不可更改的，不可挽回的论调，称为是基本与不可逃避的事实。但你方所一再重复的蛮不讲理的论调并不能代表任何事实，而只是表现了你方还没有对战俘问题达成协议以实现朝鲜停战的意愿。最后的不可更改的不可挽回的事实是我方被俘人员对你方非人道待遇的坚决反抗，是我方被俘人员对你方的强迫甄别的正义斗争，是你方将永远不能实现扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰的企图。你方声称将事实公诸世人，将不能有助于协议，而只能证明双方之间的分歧。事实是不能掩盖不容抹杀的，双方之间分歧的所以存在，协议之所以不能达成，不在于事实的公开，而在于你方采取不讲理不协商的蛮横态度，坚持你方片面无理的方案。为达成协议，实现停战，你方必须改变你方不讲理、不协商的蛮横态度，放弃你方扣留我方被俘人员的企图，立即在我方五月二日方案的基础上进行讨论解决问题。
