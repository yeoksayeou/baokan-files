The late film artist Comrade Chen Bo'er was an excellent screenwriter. In the early days of the establishment of the people's film industry, she created two films with distinct themes: the artistic film "Boundless Light" and the documentary "The New Lüda for the People." These two films reflected the leading role of the working class in the construction of the new China, and truthfully demonstrated the working class's selfless and patriotic spirit. "Boundless Light" played a certain role in encouraging the working people to actively produce.

The reason why the content of "Boundless Light" makes the audience feel close is mainly because Comrade Bo'er went deep into the factories before creating it, lived with the workers, deeply understood the united, friendly, strong, great, and creative character of the working class, and understood their actual lives and their thoughts and feelings, so that she could truly express the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class in her works.

"Boundless Light" was completed in 1949 and has been screened at home and abroad, receiving praise from audiences both domestically and internationally. When the film was first screened in Benxi, Hegang, Xiaofengman, Xi'an, and Fushun, it was deeply welcomed by the audience, especially the working masses. Li Shilin, a worker at the Anshan Power Plant, watched it four times in a row. Many workers were moved to tears when they saw Zhou Mingying and Master Sun jump into the very hot boiler to repair the fault. They were very happy when they saw Zhou Mingying filling out her application to join the Party. They expressed that they wanted to learn from Zhou Mingying's selfless spirit of dedicating herself to the construction of the motherland.

When this film was screened in factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, the workers were very excited because they saw that they were not only the masters of the country, but also the protagonists in the film. The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant unanimously believed that the film inspired their production enthusiasm and raised their vigilance against the conspiracies of Kuomintang agents. After watching the film, the workers of the Fengtai Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot and the Tianjin Textile Workers' Union deeply felt that the workers could only fully display their wisdom and creativity under the leadership of the Communist Party. Zhou Mingying's spirit of overcoming difficulties and working selflessly demonstrated the strength of the working class, thus increasing the workers' enthusiasm for production. Because this film praised the deeds of the working class, the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company specially sent a silk banner to the Central Film Bureau to express their gratitude. From these situations, we can see how the workers welcomed "Boundless Light".

The influence of "Boundless Light" is not only among the working masses, but it also has a considerable educational effect on cadres. As one journalist said: "In addition to learning about labor attitude, working methods, democratic management in factories, and understanding the great policies of the Communist Party in this film, an intellectual should more deeply appreciate the feelings of the working class and improve his ideological level." (See "Watching 'Boundless Light'," Guangming Daily, March 1, 1950) In addition, a comrade who was transferred from the army to work in a factory also changed his thinking of belittling workers and clearly recognized that workers "are the locomotives in the industrial construction of the new China... and can no longer carry the 'burden of history' and see themselves as 'superior' to workers" because he was inspired by "Boundless Light." (See "'Boundless Light' Gives Us Inspiration," Nanjing Xinhua Daily, April 28, 1950) The film is thus improving everyone's political awareness and work enthusiasm, and changing the complacency of intellectuals and the thinking of some people who consider themselves heroes.

When "Boundless Light" was screened abroad, it received enthusiastic praise from foreign friends because it introduced the historic reforms of New Democratic China in economic construction. For example, the Soviet Taladankin believed that "this new film... describes the working class united around the Communist Party of China, which has determined the historical task of national independence and national economic construction, and shows their high patriotic spirit, and how the liberated people's labor force is helping the smooth realization of this great task." "This film is a good illustration of the tremendous changes that are taking place in the working class and technical intellectuals of the People's Republic of China." "'Chinese Daughters' has been successfully performed on Soviet screens, and now there is this film 'Boundless Light', which describes the real people and events in China and has a high degree of ideological content. These two films fully confirm that Chinese film art has embarked on the path of lofty purpose - to meet the requirements of its great people." The Soviet Sergei also gave this film a positive review in his article "Review of the Chinese Feature Film 'Boundless Light'." He wrote: "When the Chinese people experienced the true spring of revival,... when millions of people felt that they would be able to enjoy the fruits of their labor and were immersed in the climax of creation - life provided artists with new themes... The film 'Boundless Light' by directors Xu Ke and screenwriter Comrade Chen Bo'er reflects this passion for revival, this joyful and constructive daily work, on Soviet screens... This film does not have exaggerated and magnificent sets, it is very plain, as plain as the daily construction work of the People's Republic. But behind the plain exterior, there is a wealth of content, a world of thoughts and feelings, a deep will and the truth of life." (See the Soviet "Art Newspaper," No. 63, 1950)

From the articles of Soviet friends, we can see their evaluation of our people's film "Boundless Light." The hard work of our people's film workers has been rewarding. As Sergei said, "The plot of the film is summarized and reflected faithfully in the creation of the film's directors and writers who have participated in the people's struggle, in accordance with the will of the people." The success of "Boundless Light" is not accidental. This is primarily the result of screenwriter Comrade Chen Bo'er's hard work in following the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

### 国内外对影片“光芒万丈”的评论

    国内外对影片“光芒万丈”的评论
    已故电影艺术家陈波儿同志，是一位优秀的电影剧本作者。在人民电影工作建立的初期，她一连创作了两部主题鲜明的电影剧本：一部是艺术片“光芒万丈”，另一部是纪录片“人民的新旅大”。这两部影片反映了新中国的工人阶级在生产建设事业上的领导作用，真实地表现了工人阶级大公无私的、爱国主义的精神。“光芒万丈”曾在鼓舞劳动人民积极生产上起了一定的作用。
    “光芒万丈”的内容所以使观众感到亲切，主要因为波儿同志在创作前深入工厂，和工人们生活在
    一起，深深地体会了工人阶级那种团结友爱、坚强伟大、勇于创造的性格，了解了他们的实际生活和他们的思想感情，因此能在作品中真切地表现出工人阶级的积极性和创造性。
    “光芒万丈”于一九四九年摄制完成，在国内外都放映过，它得到了国内外观众的好评。当这部影片在本溪、鹤岗、小丰满、西安和抚顺首先放映时，深受观众，特别是工人群众的欢迎。鞍山发电厂的工人李世林，一连看了四次。很多工人一看到周明英和孙师父跳到热度很高的锅炉里去修理故障的情形，就都流下了感动的热泪。当他们看到周明英填写入党志愿书的时候，他们都非常高兴。他们表示要学习周明英的献身于祖国建设事业的忘我精神。
    这个片子在北京、天津、上海、南京各地工厂放映的时候，工人都非常兴奋，因为他们看到了自己既是国家的主人，又成了电影里的主人翁。石景山钢铁厂的工人们一致认为：影片启发了他们的生产积极性，提高了他们对国民党特务阴谋活动的警惕。丰台铁路局机务段和天津纺织工会的工人们看了影片之后，深深地感觉到工人只有在共产党的领导下，才能充分发挥自己的智慧和创造才能。周明英克服困难和忘我工作的精神，则表现了工人阶级的力量，因而提高了工人们的生产热情。上海电力公司的工人因为这部电影表扬了工人阶级的事迹，特送了一面锦旗给中央电影局，表示感谢。从这些情况中，我们可以看到工人是怎样地欢迎“光芒万丈”。
    “光芒万丈”的影响并不只在工人群众中，它对干部也有着相当大的教育作用。曾有一位新闻工作者这样说：“我们除了在这个影片中学习到劳动态度，学习到工作方法，学到工厂中的民主管理，了解共产党的伟大政策外，一个知识分子更应深深地去体味工人阶级的感情，提高自己的思想水平。”（见一九五零年三月一日光明日报“看‘光芒万丈’”一文）另外，一位从部队调到工厂工作的同志，也由于受了“光芒万丈”的启示，改变了自己轻视工人的思想，明确认识了工人“是新中国工业建设中的火车头，……再不能背上‘历史的包袱’，把自己看得比工人‘高一等’。”（见一九五零年四月二十八日南京新华日报“‘光芒万丈’给我们的启示”一文）影片就是这样提高着大家的政治觉悟和工作热情，改变着知识分子的自满情绪和某些人的功臣思想。
    “光芒万丈”在国外放映时，由于它介绍了新民主主义中国在经济建设方面的历史性的改革，获得了国外友人的热烈赞扬。如苏联塔拉丹金认为“这部新的影片……描述了团结在为民族独立、为国家经济建设而决定了历史任务的中国共产党周围的工人阶级，表现了他们高度的爱国精神，而解放了的人民劳动力，是如何地帮助了这个伟大任务顺利的实现”。“这部影片就是在中华人民共和国的工人阶级与技术知识分子中，正在进行着巨大改变的一个很好的说明。”“‘中华女儿’在苏联银幕上成功地演出了，现在又加上这一部描述中国真人真事的、具有高度思想性的影片‘光芒万丈’。这两部影片充分证实了中国电影艺术已经在具有崇高目的——满足自己伟大人民要求的大道上迈进了。”而苏联谢尔格也夫在“评中国艺术片‘光芒万丈’”一文中，也给这部影片以好评。他写道：“当中国人民体验到真正的复活的春天时，……当千百万人感到本身将能享受自己的劳动果实，而浸沉在创造高潮中时——生活给艺术家提供了新的题材。……导演许珂、编剧陈波儿同志的影片“光芒万丈”就向苏联银幕上反映了这种复兴的激情，这种愉快的、建设的日常工作。……这部影片并没有夸张效果的堂皇布景，非常平淡，像人民共和国日常的建设工作一样平淡。但是在平淡的外衣后面，却有丰富的内容，却有思想和感情的世界，却有深刻的意志倾向和生活的真理。”（见一九五零年六十三期苏联“艺术报”）
    我们从苏联友人的文章里，看出了他们对我国人民电影“光芒万丈”的评价。我们的人民电影工作者的辛勤工作，是有收获的。正如谢尔格也夫说的：“影片出现的情节，是由参加过人民斗争的影片编导者，符合人民的意志，在自己的创造中，忠实地归纳和反映出来的。”“光芒万丈”的成功不是偶然的。这首先是剧作者陈波儿同志遵循毛主席所指示的文艺方向，辛勤劳作的结果。
