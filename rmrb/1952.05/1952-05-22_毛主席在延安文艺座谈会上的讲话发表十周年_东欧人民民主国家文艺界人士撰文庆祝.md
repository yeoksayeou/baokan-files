Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 21st: Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in May 1942 has received great attention from literary and art circles in Eastern European People's Democratic countries. This great work, which brilliantly points out the direction of the development of people's literature and art, has been published in these countries and is being carefully studied and discussed by literary and art workers.

    In the German Democratic Republic, the Berlin magazine "East and West" published a German abridged translation of Chairman Mao's work in 1949, based on the English translation. In December 1950, the Berlin "Hanschel" publishing company published a German translation based on the French translation. The publication of this separate edition immediately aroused great attention in German literary and artistic circles and public opinion. Berlin's "Monthly Labor Journal," "Berlin Daily," "World Forum" weekly, and other newspapers and magazines in various places have successively published excerpts from this speech or published articles to comment on it. The widely circulated political, literary, and economic comprehensive weekly "World Forum" stated: "Mao Zedong's creative achievement lies in the concrete application of historical materialism and dialectical materialism, the basic Marxist theory of art, to the current situation in China. This speech is of great help to us in analyzing the current German situation and thus finding out the characteristics of relevant literary and art policies."

    In April 1950, the Polish "Reader Publishing House" published Chairman Mao's speech in Polish. The Polish public opinion circles also attached great importance to this great work. The organ of the Polish United Workers' Party, "People's Tribune," the organ of the Polish Republic government, "Polish Republic," the government organ "Polish Daily" published in Krakow, the "Lodz Daily" issued in Lodz, and other newspapers have successively published introductory articles. The "People's Tribune" commentary emphasized that Mao Zedong's speech talked about the Marxist-Leninist aesthetic view and put forward the tasks of artists and literary critics. It has become the program of the Chinese Communist Party in the cultural field and the declaration of the Party's art policy.

    People in other Eastern European People's Democratic countries can also read Chairman Mao's book. In Czechoslovakia, the first translation was published by the publishing bureau of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union in 1950. Booklet No. 113 of the "Marxist-Leninist Small Series," "Literature and Art in New China," published in Hungary in 1950, contained the concluding part of this speech. The theoretical publication of the Hungarian Working People's Party, "Social Review," published a book review in its December 1950 issue to introduce it. Romania has also published many works by Chairman Mao, among which "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has received great attention and is considered a rich classic work with special practical significance.

    On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art (May 23), literary and art workers from Eastern European People's Democratic countries have written articles to celebrate. Anna Seghers, a famous German female writer and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, said: "Mao Zedong's speech helped me when I read it several years ago. It helped me see some of my mistakes. It will also help me avoid making mistakes in the future." Hungarian poet and literary critic, József Attila Literary Prize winner Zsombor György published a commemorative article titled "Mao Zedong on Literature" in the Hungarian "Literary Gazette." He pointed out that in the ten years since the publication of this speech, "it has become a brilliant weapon in the international arsenal for struggling for socialist-realist literature. Mao Zedong's speech not only laid the foundation for China's literature, which is striding forward, but also serves as a compass for all progressive literature in the world, as well as for our new literature." Selmárú, secretary of the Writers' Union of the Romanian People's Republic, wrote: In the ten years since the publication of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, "the literary and artistic path experienced by the Chinese people is glorious, and its future is bright. The literary and artistic workers of the Romanian People's Republic congratulate the tenth anniversary of the publication of the speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art with the deepest internationalist spirit, congratulate the brothers of the People's Republic of China, and wish the glorious literary and artistic army of the Chinese people new victories on the road of struggle for the common cause of peace and socialism."

    毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表十周年
    东欧人民民主国家文艺界人士撰文庆祝
    【新华社布拉格二十一日电】毛主席一九四二年五月在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，受到东欧人民民主国家文艺界的重视。这篇英明地指出人民文艺发展方向的伟大著作，已在这些国家出版，并为各国的文艺工作者细心地研读着和讨论着。
    在德意志民主共和国，柏林“东方与西方”杂志在一九四九年曾根据毛主席这篇著作的英译本发表了德文节译本。一九五○年十二月，柏林“汉舍尔”出版公司又根据法译本出版了德文译本。这一单行本出版之后立即引起了德国文艺界和舆论界的极大注意。柏林的“劳动月刊”、“柏林日报”、“世界论坛”周刊，以及其他各地的报纸杂志，都先后摘要刊载这篇讲话，或发表文章加以评论。销路很广的政治、文艺、经济综合周刊“世界论坛”说：“毛泽东的创造性业迹在于把历史唯物主义与辩证唯物主义，把马克思主义基本的艺术理论具体地运用到中国的当前情况中。这篇讲话对于我们分析目前德国形势并从而找出有关文艺政策方面的特点，有着极大的帮助。”
    波兰“读者出版社”在一九五○年四月，以波兰文出版了毛主席的这篇讲话。波兰舆论界对这一伟大的著作也极为重视。波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”、波兰共和国政府机关报“波兰共和”、在克拉科出版的政府机关报“波兰日报”、在罗兹发行的“罗兹日报”，以及其他报纸曾纷纷发表了介绍的文章。“人民论坛报”的评论曾强调指出：毛泽东的讲话谈到了马克思—列宁主义的美学观，提出了艺术家和文艺批评的任务。它成了中国共产党在文化领域的纲领，和党的艺术政策的宣言。
    东欧其他人民民主国家的人民也可以读到了毛主席这本著作。在捷克斯洛伐克，第一个译本是由捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟出版局在一九五○年出版的。匈牙利一九五○年出版的“马克思—列宁主义者小丛书”第一一三号小册子“新中国的文艺”，载有这篇讲话的结论部分。匈牙利劳动人民党中央理论刊物“社会评论”一九五○年十二月号，曾发表书评加以介绍。罗马尼亚也出版了毛主席的许多著作，其中“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”受到很大的注意，而且被认为是一本具有特别现实意义的丰富的经典著作。
    在毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表十周年纪念日（五月二十三日）前夕，东欧人民民主国家的文艺界人士纷纷撰文庆祝。德国著名女作家、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人安娜·西格斯说：“毛泽东的讲话在我数年前读到它的时候曾经帮助了我。它帮助我看到我的若干错误。它今后也将帮助我去避免犯错误。”匈牙利诗人、文艺批评家，约瑟夫·阿吉拉文学奖金得奖人索姆佑·杰尔基在匈牙利“文学报”发表了题为“毛泽东论文学”的纪念文章。他指出：这篇讲话在发表十年来，“已成了为社会主义—现实主义文学而奋斗的国际武库中的光辉武器。毛泽东的讲话不仅为大踏步向前迈进的中国的文学奠定了基础，同时也是全世界一切进步文学以及我们的新文学的指南针”。罗马尼亚人民共和国作家联盟书记谢尔玛鲁著文说：毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表以来的十年中，“中国人民所经历的文艺道路是光辉的，它的前途是灿烂的。罗马尼亚人民共和国的文艺工作者谨以最深厚的国际主义精神祝贺延安文艺座谈会上的讲话发表的十周年，向中华人民共和国的兄弟们祝贺，并祝中国人民光辉的文艺大军在争取和平与社会主义共同事业的斗争道路上获得新的胜利。”
