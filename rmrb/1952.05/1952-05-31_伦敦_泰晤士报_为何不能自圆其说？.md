The Korean armistice negotiations, which are of close concern to people all over the world, are currently facing a serious crisis solely due to the U.S. side's insistence on implementing the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" to forcibly detain over 100,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side. This situation has long aroused strong indignation and dissatisfaction among the vast number of peace-loving people. Recently, after former U.S. Generals Dodd and Colson publicly admitted that the U.S. side had used torture, coercion, and mass killings to forcibly screen our captured personnel, and after more bloody crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors in massacring our captured personnel on a large scale for the purpose of forced screening were exposed, the honest public opinion of the whole world was in an uproar, unanimously condemning the U.S. aggressors for the heinous crimes they had committed against our captured personnel, violating international law and the standards of human morality. In Britain, the broad masses of the people, like the people of other countries, have once again issued a strong call for peace, demanding that the prisoner-of-war dispute be resolved in accordance with the Geneva Convention in order to achieve a Korean armistice agreement. Even a considerable number of bourgeois public opinion and some Labour Party members have expressed dissatisfaction or protest against the U.S. aggressors' illegal and bloody "forced screening."

Under these circumstances, the London "Times" could not but react. This newspaper, which usually reflects the opinions of the British government, then published two editorials on May 8th and May 23rd, respectively, commenting on the prisoner-of-war issue in the Korean negotiations. In these two editorials, the "Times," on the one hand, had to admit that the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle" and "screening" stubbornly insisted upon by the United States were in violation of "customary law and international law" and in violation of the "Geneva Convention"; but on the other hand, it not only did not have the courage to criticize or deny the unreasonable demands of the United States, which violated "customary law and international law," but also tried its best to justify the unreasonable demands of the United States. In this way, the "Times" editorial fell into an irresolvable logical contradiction and could not reconcile its arguments.

In the May 8th editorial, the "Times" admitted that "for two hundred years, it has been generally accepted that belligerents should repatriate prisoners of war after the end of the war. As recently as 1949, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union signed the Geneva Convention, which seems to make this obligation binding"; but on the other hand, it praised the U.S. side for not abandoning the unreasonable position of "voluntary repatriation," calling it "a basic principle to which the United Nations forces are not prepared to compromise." As is well known, the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates that all prisoners of war should be released and repatriated immediately after the cessation of hostilities. This provision is as incompatible with the U.S.'s robbery act of forcibly detaining a large number of our captured personnel under the guise of "voluntary repatriation" as fire and water. However, the "Times" here stubbornly tries to portray the two as consistent, and portrays the "voluntary repatriation," which it knows is a violation of the Geneva Convention, as being in line with the Geneva Convention.

In the May 23rd editorial, the "Times" similarly admitted: "Customary law and international law both require that after the cessation of hostilities, countries should send their prisoners of war back," and the "meaning" of the Geneva Convention "cannot be that all prisoners have the right to choose where they want to live." However, unlike the May 8th editorial, after the truth about the U.S. aggressors forcibly detaining our captured personnel with hunger, torture, and bayonets was revealed to the world, the "Times" seemed to realize that the U.S.'s "voluntary repatriation principle" had become "stinky" and could no longer be promoted. Therefore, it turned to making some painless criticisms of the so-called "chaos in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps and the incompetence of some American officials managing prisoners of war," and formally abandoned the U.S.'s "voluntary repatriation principle," putting forward its own invented so-called "higher principle." What exactly is the "Times"'s so-called "higher legal principle or humanitarian principle"? According to the "Times": "The only principle that can defend the United Nations policy is the principle of asylum, that is, the right of people who are threatened with death and persecution in their own country to seek asylum in another country." However, even the "Times" itself admits that this "principle" is first of all a betrayal of the Geneva Convention, and therefore, on the issue of prisoner-of-war repatriation, like the so-called "voluntary repatriation principle," it is completely without legal basis and illegal. The "Times" then had to say shamelessly: The Geneva Convention, "which is not legally binding on our country (Britain), can and must be disregarded when higher legal principles or humanitarian principles require it." Secondly, anyone with a little common sense knows that the "principle of asylum" referred to by the "Times" refers to the "right of asylum" or "right of residence" that governments of various countries can grant to various types of political exiles engaged in activities against their own governments. However, what similarities are there between political exiles and prisoners of war? Political exiles automatically request protection after fleeing to other countries, so most countries' constitutions have explicit provisions allowing them to reside; while prisoners of war captured on the battlefield, although captured, still belong to the other party to the conflict, so "customary law and international law" require their complete repatriation. In fact, our captured personnel, despite being subjected to all kinds of abuse and threats of knives and guns by the U.S. aggressors, still bravely carried out an unyielding struggle against inhuman treatment and "forced screening." Their iron will to resolutely demand a return to their motherland is a well-known fact throughout the world. Even when the "Times" mentioned the so-called "principle of asylum," it could not but admit that our captured personnel were not "traitors fighting against their own country." This admission by the "Times" is tantamount to declaring that its so-called "principle of asylum" is fundamentally untenable. Moreover, in the Korean armistice negotiations, treating our captured personnel as political prisoners and forcibly preventing them from "unwilling to be repatriated" with bayonets is a serious political issue. This goes beyond the scope of not involving political issues in the armistice negotiations. It can be seen from this that the only principle that the "Times" believes can defend the U.S.'s policy of forcibly detaining our captured personnel—the so-called "principle of asylum"—is fundamentally untenable.

The "Times" obviously saw that the bloody "screening results" fabricated by the U.S. aggressors had been unanimously condemned by the British people and the people of the world, including many British newspapers and members of Parliament. Therefore, it pretended to be fair and came up with a way to exonerate the U.S. aggressors, advocating that the so-called United Nations forces immediately send a "fair committee to re-screen the prisoners." This so-called "fair" suggestion from the "Times" is equally unworthy of refutation. Because, as mentioned above, since the "Times" admits that the Geneva Convention stipulates that both sides of the conflict have an obligation to repatriate prisoners of war, and that "forced screening" is a direct violation of this obligation; since the prisoner-of-war issue cannot be equated with the political prisoner issue, and prisoners of war are fundamentally not applicable to the so-called "right of asylum"; then, are not both "forced screening" and "re-screening" obviously illegal? Are they not something that any fair person who respects "customary law and international law" cannot tolerate? This suggestion from the "Times" is clearly a trap attempting to legalize the U.S.'s illegal and bloody "forced screening." Is there any room for doubt about this?

The reason why the "Times"'s two editorials are logically contradictory and lack a solid foundation is by no means accidental. This is because: In the situation where the broad masses of the British people are unanimously calling for peace and condemning the U.S.'s unreasonable plan and the Koje Island atrocities, on the one hand, it cannot but express some dissatisfaction with the U.S. aggressors' incompetence and arrogance in dealing with the negotiation issues and the prisoner-of-war issue, and has to admit that this attitude of the United States is in violation of international law and the Geneva Convention; but on the other hand, its keynote is still to try its best to strongly defend the U.S.'s absurd claims. Obviously, this kind of bias and echoing is of no benefit to breaking the current deadlock in the Korean armistice negotiations. In the current serious situation, only when the power of the people and the power of public opinion force the U.S. side to strictly abide by the provisions of international law, abide by the provisions of the military armistice negotiations, put away its absurd claims of "voluntary repatriation" and "forced screening," and change its barbaric attitude of refusing to negotiate, is it possible to achieve the Korean armistice agreement and peace that the world hopes for.

### 伦敦“泰晤士报”为何不能自圆其说？

    伦敦“泰晤士报”为何不能自圆其说？
    全世界人民密切关心的朝鲜停战谈判，目前仅仅因为一个问题，即美方坚持实行所谓“自愿遣返原则”以强迫扣留朝中方面十万以上被俘人员而遭到了严重的危机。这种情况，早已引起了广大爱好和平人民的强烈的愤慨和不满。最近期间，在前美国将军杜德和柯尔生公开承认美方曾以酷刑、威逼、集体屠杀等手段强迫甄别我方被俘人员以后，在美国侵略者为了强迫甄别而大批屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行被更多地揭发之后，全世界正直的舆论莫不为之大哗，一致声讨美国侵略者违反国际公法和人类道德标准，对我方被俘人员所犯下的滔天罪行。在英国，广大人民如同其他各国人民一样，已经再次发出了要求和平，要求按照日内瓦公约解决战俘争端以获致朝鲜停战协议的强大呼声。甚至相当数量的资产阶级舆论和一部分工党议员，对美国侵略者非法的、血腥的“强迫甄别”，也都表示不满或抗议。
    在这种情势之下，伦敦“泰晤士报”也不能不有所反应。这家通常反映英国官方意见的报纸于是在五月八日和五月二十三日连续发表了两篇评论朝鲜谈判中有关战俘问题的社论。“泰晤士报”在这两篇社论中，一方面不得不承认美国所顽固坚持的所谓“自愿遣返原则”和“甄别”是违反“习惯法和国际法”，违反“日内瓦公约”的；但在另一方面，它不但没有勇气批评或否定美国这个违反“习惯法和国际法”的无理主张，而且还竭力替美国的无理主张强作辩护。这样，“泰晤士报”的社论就在逻辑上陷于无可解脱的矛盾而不能自圆其说。
    “泰晤士报”在八日的社论中，一面承认“两百年来，大家一直公认在战争结束后交战国应遣返战俘。近如一九四九年，英国、美国和苏联签订了日内瓦公约，这个公约似乎使这个义务有了约束力”；但在另一方面，它又赞扬美方不放弃“自愿遣返”的无理立场，称之为“联合国军对之不准备妥协的基本原则”。而如所周知，日内瓦公约明确地规定在敌对行为停止后应立即释放和遣返全部战俘。这个规定和美国在“自愿遣返”的招牌下强迫扣留我方大批战俘的强盗行径，犹如水火之不能相容，但
    “泰晤士报”在这里却硬想把两者说成是一致的，把那个明知是违反日内瓦公约的“自愿遣返”说成是符合日内瓦公约的。
    在二十三日的社论中，“泰晤士报”同样地承认：“习惯法和国际法都要求敌对行为停止后，各国应将它们的战俘送回去”，日内瓦公约的“含义，不可能是说一切俘虏都有权利去选择他们愿意到什么地方去生活”。但与五月八日社论不同的是：在美国侵略者以饥饿、酷刑和枪尖强迫扣留我方被俘人员的真相大白于天下之后，“泰晤士报”似乎是察觉到美国的“自愿遣返原则”已经是“臭气熏天”，再也无法张口替它捧场，因此，它就转而对所谓美方“战俘营中的混乱以及若干管理战俘的美国官员的无能”，作一些不痛不痒的批评，并在形式上抛弃了美国的“自愿遣返原则”，提出了它自己发明的所谓“更高级的原则”。“泰晤士报”的所谓“更高级的法律原则或人道原则”，究竟是什么呢？据“泰晤士报”说：“能够为联合国政策辩护的唯一原则，就是避难原则，即在本国受到死亡及迫害威胁的人们到别国去避难的权利”。但是，连“泰晤士报”自己也承认，这种“原则”首先是对日内瓦公约的背弃，因而它在战俘遣返问题上，和所谓“自愿遣返原则”一样，是完全没有法理根据的，非法的。“泰晤士报”于是不得不无赖地说：日内瓦公约“这个在法律上对我国（英国）并无约束力的公约，在更高级的法律原则或人道原则需要的时候，是可以而且必须置之不顾的”。其次，任何稍有常识的人都知道，“泰晤士报”所指的“避难原则”，是指对于各种不同种类的从事反对本国政府活动的流亡政治犯，各国政府可以予以“避难权”或“居留权”而言。然而流亡的政治犯和战俘有什么相同之处呢？政治犯在流亡到他国后自动要求托庇，因此各国宪法对流亡政治犯大多均有明文规定，准予居留；而在战场上被俘的战俘他们虽然被俘，但仍然属于交战双方他方的人员，因此“习惯法和国际法”均要求予以全部遣返。事实上，我方被俘人员虽在美国侵略者百般虐待和屠刀枪尖威胁之下，仍然英勇地为反对非人道待遇和“强迫甄别”而进行了不屈不挠的斗争。他们坚决要求重返祖国的钢铁意志，是举世皆知的事。即使“泰晤士报”在提到所谓“避难原则”时，也不能不承认，我方被俘人员并不是“对他们自己国家作战的叛徒”。“泰晤士报”这一承认，无异于宣告它所提出的所谓“避难原则”，根本不能成立。不仅如此，在朝鲜停战谈判中把我方被俘人员说成是政治犯，并用枪尖强逼他们“不愿遣返”，乃是一个严重的政治问题。这就越出了停战谈判中不涉及政治问题的范围。由此可见，“泰晤士报”认为可以替美国强迫扣留我方被俘人员的政策辩护的唯
    一原则——所谓“避难原则”，是根本不能成立的。
    “泰晤士报”显然看到美国侵略者捏造的血腥
    “甄别结果”，已经遭到英国人民和全世界人民，包括不少英国报刊和国会议员在内的一致唾骂，因而故作公正，想出一个为美国侵略者解脱的办法，主张所谓联合国军目前马上派遣一个“公平的委员会重新甄别俘虏”。“泰晤士报”这个所谓“公正”的建议，是同样不值一驳的。因为如上所述，既然
    “泰晤士报”承认日内瓦公约规定交战双方有义务遣返战俘，而“强迫甄别”是直接违反这个义务的；既然战俘问题与政治犯问题不能相提并论，战俘根本不适用于所谓“避难权”；那么，无论“强迫甄别”或“重新甄别”不都是显然违法的事情么？不都是任何一个尊重“习惯法和国际法”的公正人士所不能容忍的事情吗？“泰晤士报”的这个建议，显然是一个企图使美国非法的血腥“强迫甄别”合法化的圈套，这难道还有丝毫怀疑的余地吗？
    “泰晤士报”两篇社论之所以发生逻辑矛盾和立论无据的原因，完全不是偶然的。这是由于：在英国广大人民同声要求和平，斥责美国的无理方案和巨济岛暴行的情势下，它一方面不能不对美国侵略者在处理谈判问题和战俘问题上的无能和专横态度表示某些不满，并不得不承认美国这种态度是违反国际公法和日内瓦公约的，但在另一方面，它的基调仍然是要竭力为美国的荒谬主张进行强辩。显然地，这种偏袒和附和，对于打开目前朝鲜停战谈判的僵局，是毫无裨益的。在目前严重的情况下，只有在人民的力量和舆论的力量迫使美方严格遵守国际法的规定，遵守军事停战谈判的规定，收起其
    “自愿遣返”和“强迫甄别”的荒谬主张并改变其拒绝协商的横蛮态度时，那么，举世希望的朝鲜停战协议与和平，才有获致的可能。（新华社）
