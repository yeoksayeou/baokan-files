    New Atmosphere in a Private Watch and Clock Shop After the "Five-Anti" Movement
    Jiang Xia
    On April 5th, Beijing's Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop readjusted the prices of more than 150 kinds of goods based on the relatively reasonable profit agreed upon by the labor-capital consultation. The new commodity prices were lower than before the anti-corruption movement. The store is currently actively preparing to replenish new goods, and both labor and management are full of confidence in welcoming the growing business situation.
    This is the new atmosphere appearing in private shops after the working class led the broad masses of people to eliminate the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists.
    Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop has more than 20 employees. Like some other private shops, this shop also had many illegal acts. In the three years since liberation, the capitalist of Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop evaded more than 50 million yuan in national taxes alone; in order to so-called "cast a long line to catch big fish," he once bribed cadres of state organs with more than 1.5 million yuan. According to the illegal acts of the capitalist of Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop, it should have been classified as a semi-legal and semi-illegal household; but because he chose the path of frank confession in the face-to-face reasoning struggle of the workers, honestly confessed all his problems of tax evasion and bribery, and also reported more than 20 illegal acts of capitalists in the same industry, he obtained leniency from the People's Government and was changed from a semi-legal and semi-illegal household to a basically law-abiding household, without criminal punishment, and no longer pursued the evaded taxes.
    The working class is selfless and always thinks about promoting the economy. After the workers of Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop won the victory in the anti-corruption struggle, they actively united with the capitalists to negotiate the development of business, and based on the business policy of small profits but quick turnover and the correct attitude of being responsible to customers, they took the initiative to discuss issues such as capital, profits, and costs with the capitalists, and made specific regulations. In the past, the average profit of Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop in selling watches and clocks (including new and old watches) was about 60%; the profit of repairing watches even reached more than 100%; and the profit of selling razors attached was also more than 40%. After both parties studied, it was decided to reduce the average profit of watches and clocks to 30%; the profit of repairing watches should not exceed 50%; and the profit of razors should be reduced to 25%. Customers who bought cheap goods sincerely thanked the anti-corruption movement led by the People's Government for giving them real benefits.
    The clerks of Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop explained the following principle to the capitalists: although the profit may seem small in future business operations, the profit obtained will still not be reduced due to the increase in customers and the expansion of turnover. In order to solve the problem of commodity backlog, after consultation, it was decided that in the future, when preparing goods, the quantity should be smaller, but they should be bought frequently. Business should face the broad masses of people, and prepare more alarm clocks and round wall clocks. In order to reduce the cost of goods, efforts should be made to save costs in packaging and transportation; and careful calculations should be made to include actual expenses in the cost.
    Like many private shops, Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop's past business attitude was also dishonest. The manager relied on his mouth to sell a watch with a purchase price of 2 million yuan to customers at a price more than double the price; when customers came to repair watches, some watches were not broken, but the shop insisted that something was broken, put it there for two days, said it was repaired, and then asked the customer for tens of thousands of yuan; when repairing watches, they promised to provide customers with good mainsprings, but in fact they replaced them with bad ones. The clerks said: "In the past, we also unconsciously deceived customers for the capitalists, and we will never allow this behavior to happen again in the future."
    Since the prices of goods were reduced, the turnover of Wuhua Watch and Clock Shop has increased—before April 5th, the daily turnover was 2 million yuan, and after April 5th, the daily turnover increased to 3.5 million yuan. This was a great education for the capitalists. Manager Mao Zhichen held the labor discipline regulations given to him by the workers and said with emotion: "I was wrong about the clerks before. I always thought that the workers only cared about welfare issues, and I was not at ease when I was not at the counter; but since the implementation of democratic management, the clerks have been working more actively, which is a hundred times better than one person worrying about it." He said: "The anti-corruption movement has brought a new atmosphere to our business. I will definitely honestly improve labor-capital relations and business under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy in the future."

    一家私营钟表行在“五反”运动后的新气象
    江夏
    北京市五华钟表行在四月五号那天，根据劳资协商所同意的比较合理的利润，把一百五十多种商品的价格重新做了调整。新的商品价格比较反盗窃运动以前减低了。这家商店目前正在积极准备添置新货，劳资双方都充满信心迎接日益发展的营业局面。
    这是在工人阶级领导广大人民肃清了违法资本家的“五毒”以后，出现在私营商店中的新气象。
    五华钟表行现有职工二十多人。和其他一些私营商店一样，这家商店也曾有过许多违法行为。解放三年来，五华钟表行资方仅偷漏国家的税款就有五千多万元；为了所谓“放长线，钓大鱼”，他一次就向国家机关干部行贿一百五十多万元。按照五华钟表行资方的违法行为，它是应被列入半违法半守法户的；但由于他在工人面对面的说理斗争情况下，选择了坦白悔过的道路，比较老实地交代了自己偷税、行贿的全部问题，还检举了同业资本家的二十多件违法行为，获得了人民政府的宽大，被由半违法半守法户改为基本守法户，不受刑事处分，也不再追补偷漏的税款。
    工人阶级是大公无私、处处为着繁荣经济着想的。五华钟表行的职工在反盗窃斗争取得胜利以后，便积极主动团结资方，协商发展业务，根据薄利多销的经营方针、对顾客认真负责的正确态度，主动和资方讨论了资金、利润、成本等问题，并作出了具体规定。五华钟表行过去经售钟表（包括新、旧表）的利润平均在百分之六十左右；修理钟表的利润竟达百分之百以上；附售的理发器具的利润也在百分之四十以上。经过双方研究，决定把钟表的利润平均降低到百分之三十；修表的利润不超过百分之五十；理发器具利润降低到百分之二十五。买到便宜货物的顾客们，都衷心感谢人民政府领导的反盗窃运动，使他们得到了实惠。
    五华钟表行的店员们向资方讲明白了这样一个道理：今后业务经营时看利虽小，由于顾客的增加，流水额扩大，得到的利润仍然不会减少。为了解决商品积压的问题，经过协商，决定今后预备货时，量要少些，但要勤买。经营要面向广大群众，多准备闹钟、圆挂钟。为了减低商品的成本，力求在包装、运输上节约费用；并精打细算，根据实际开支计入成本。
    和很多私营商店一样，五华钟表行过去的经营态度也是不老实的。经理靠着一张嘴，能把一支来价二百万元的手表以高出一倍以上的价格卖给顾客；顾客来修表，有的表本来没有坏，店方硬说什么地方坏了，放上两天，就说修理了，便向顾客要几万元；修表时答应给顾客配好的发条，实际上却以坏的顶替。店员们说：“我们过去也不自觉地为资本家欺骗顾客，以后决不容许再有这种行为出现。”
    自从降低了商品价格以后，五华钟表行营业的流水额增加了——四月五日以前每天营业流水是二百万元，四月五日后每天营业流水增加到三百五十万元。这对资方是个很大的教育。经理毛质臣拿着工人交给他的劳动纪律条例，感动地说：“以前我对店员的看法错了，我总认为工人只是关心福利问题，我不在柜上就不放心；可是自从实行民主管理以后，店员工作更积极了，这比一个人操心胜强百倍。”他说：“反盗窃运动给我们的营业带来了新气象。我今后一定老老实实在工人阶级和国营经济领导下，搞好劳资关系，搞好业务。”
