A Dedication to Chairman Mao
Korean People's Delegation to China
Chairman Mao:

Today, we, the Korean People's Delegation to China, feel immensely honored and excited to be able to meet you, the great leader of the Chinese people and the close benefactor of the Korean people. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to you in the name of the Korean people. Since our delegation arrived in the People's Republic of China, the country of our comrades-in-arms, we have witnessed the great victories and the new atmosphere of the new China, which is leaping forward under your wise leadership, during our visit of more than four months. In particular, the splendid achievements of the Chinese people in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country have deeply moved all the comrades of our delegation and have greatly encouraged and enhanced our morale and confidence.

The movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is a source of confidence and strength for the Korean people's struggle. The power of the hardworking and brave Chinese people of the Mao Zedong era, with their abundant resources and valuable revolutionary experience, is boundless, and this great power is all for the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.

Our Korean People's Delegation to China will bring the glorious victories and great achievements of the new China back to our motherland, tell our people and the People's Army, encourage and enhance their fighting confidence, and resolve to respond to your friendship and assistance from all the Chinese people with new and greater victories.

The fighting friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, forged in blood through a long history of revolution, are being consolidated and strengthened in the just struggle against U.S. imperialism. This force cannot be destroyed by any violence. This fact has become even clearer through this visit to China.

Finally, we warmly wish the new China infinite prosperity, and for the victory of the Eastern national liberation movement and world peace, we wish you a long life!

    毛主席：
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，今天能够见到中国人民伟大领袖和朝鲜人民亲近的援助者您，感觉得无尚的光荣和无比的兴奋，谨以朝鲜人民的名义向您，致以衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。我们代表团，来到战友之国家中华人民共和国以来，在四个多月的访问期间，看到了，在您英明领导之下的向前跃进着的中国人民巨大的胜利和新中国的新气象。特别是，在抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争中所显出的中国人民灿烂的胜利的伟勋，深深的感动了我们代表团的全体同志，很有力地鼓舞和提高了我们的斗志和信心。
    抗美援朝运动是一个朝鲜人民斗争信心和力量的源泉。有着丰富资源，具有宝贵的革命经验的勤劳而勇敢的毛泽东时代的中国人民的威力是无穷无尽的，而这个伟大力量，都为着抗美援朝的胜利。
    我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，将要把新中国的辉煌胜利和巨大的成就带回祖国，去告诉祖国人民和人民军，鼓舞和提高斗争信心，决心以新的更伟大的胜利，回答您和全中国人民的友谊的援助。
    通过长久的革命历史，以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民的战斗友谊和团结，在反对美帝国主义的正义斗争中，日益得到巩固和紧密。这个力量是为任何暴力所不可摧毁的，这个事实，通过这次的访华工作，更加明了了。
    最后，热烈祝福新中国无穷隆盛，为东方民族解放运动的胜利和世界和平，祝福您万寿无疆！
    五月二十三日
