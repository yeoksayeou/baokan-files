    Liu Ronghe Promotes Afforestation Through Exemplary Actions

    During the spring afforestation campaign in the northern Anhui region, many activists emerged, including Liu Ronghe, a farmer from Shazhuangzi Village, Chutang Township, Jiashan County. He had always been fond of planting trees, but in the old society, he worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord named Guo, and could not fulfill his desire for afforestation. After liberation, he was allocated land and had the conditions for afforestation, and he immediately became an active participant in afforestation. This spring, he and eighteen other farmers from Shazhuangzi Village organized an afforestation cooperative, planting more than 40 mu of Masson pine forest and 60 mu of tung oil tree forest. To protect these young trees, he also densely planted locust trees around the forest land as a fence. Farmers in nearby villages, influenced and encouraged by him, actively organized to plant trees. Because Liu Ronghe can lead the masses in afforestation with his exemplary actions, he has been recognized by the masses as a local forestry model.

    刘荣和用模范行动推动造林
    皖北地区在春季造林运动中出现了许多积极分子，嘉山县楚塘乡沙庄子农民刘荣和就是其中的一个。他原来是很喜欢种树的，但是在旧社会里他终年给一个姓郭的地主当长工，根本不能满足自己植树造林的愿望。解放后，他分得了土地，有了造林的条件，他立即成了植树造林的积极分子。今年春天，他和沙庄子十八户农民组织了一个造林合作社，共营造马尾松林四十多亩，油桐林六十亩。他为了保护这些幼林，还在林地周围密植洋槐作为藩篱。沙庄子附近村庄的农民在他的影响和推动下，都积极组织起来造林了。刘荣和由于能用自己的模范行动领导群众植树造林，已被群众评为当地的林业模范。
