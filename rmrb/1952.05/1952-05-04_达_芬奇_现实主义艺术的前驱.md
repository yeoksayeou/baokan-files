Leonardo da Vinci [Note 1], a great scholar and great artist of the Italian Renaissance. He possessed extensive knowledge and outstanding creative talent; he worked diligently, combatively, confidently, and humbly throughout his life for the happiness of mankind. In painting alone, he left immortal examples of realist art.

Da Vinci carried forward the excellent tradition of realism in ancient Greek art, improved and enriched the creative methods of realism, and created and developed painting techniques. This genius, who regarded himself as an inventor, greatly respected objective reality, believing that "nature is the highest guide of all masters"; he disregarded all malicious slanders, opposed relying on and imitating predecessors, believing that following conventions was an important reason for the decline of art. Even when dealing with religious subjects, he was not bound by the conventions of the Middle Ages, did not treat gods as inhuman monsters, and did not treat artistic forms as symbols of certain dogmas. He repeatedly observed and studied real people, and diligently explored expression forms that were adapted to the content, thus creating real artistic images and changing the dying formalistic style of creation since the Middle Ages. His famous masterpiece "The Last Supper" is a typical example of giving a brand-new look to the commonly used religious subject, and also a model of realist art that achieves seamless unity of thought, emotion, and image.

To understand the superiority of Da Vinci's art, it is helpful to compare his "The Last Supper" with works by other famous Italian painters that used the same subject.

From Giotto (1266-1336) to Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449-1498), all dealt with the dramatic subject of "The Last Supper" in a stiff, conceptual, and cold manner. Although these authors put effort into the arrangement of the characters' positions, the layout of the background, and decorative tastes (Ghirlandaio even used twelve living people from Florence as models), they did not grasp the key to how to appropriately express this subject, ignored or did not understand how Jesus' sudden declaration, "One of you will betray me," aroused different reactions in disciples with different personalities, did not focus on the fact that the traitor Judas's crime was not completely exposed but was about to be exposed, and did not make Judas's posture, movements, and expressions conform to this special role and its special environment. Nor did they combine Jesus's expression with the sudden change of the moment, basically failing to avoid the shortcomings of Giotto's "The Last Supper." The characters sat indifferently, solemn but without enthusiasm, unnatural, untrue, the structure was scattered, the background lacked an organic connection with the characters, the focus of the event was not prominent, and the theme was unclear. Although the works of Andrea del Sarto (1486-1531), a painter born thirty-four years later than Da Vinci, had a significant sense of reality in many aspects compared to the works of Giotto and others, it was far inferior to Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" just in terms of the unnecessary prominence of two people painted on the window in the background, thus hindering the theme.

Da Vinci himself felt that the expression of Jesus in his painting did not meet his ideal, so he did not consider "The Last Supper" to be a completed work, but its reality and touching power are unparalleled. Some people believe that after watching its reproductions for a long time, they feel that they are not just looking at a painting but facing life. This is not an unfounded exaggeration because it guides people to understand life. Judging from the image of the traitor Judas alone, it far exceeds the works of Giotto and others. This is not only because Da Vinci had spent a long time in reality very seriously seeking the character and appearance of bad people that were compatible with Judas, but also because he rigorously considered the position and human relationship that conformed to the role of Judas, this traitor. In the paintings of Giotto and others, they almost only relied on the crude methods of separating seats and not painting "holy light" on the head to make people identify Judas; this was just a conceptual explanation that he was a bad person and could not arouse any real feeling. In Da Vinci's work, in contrast to Jesus's fearless demeanor, and in contrast to the passions of the disciples who showed concern, indignation, regret, self-defense, and investigation because they knew that their leader was betrayed, Judas's centrifugal and panicked demeanor was truly described. This outcast mixed in the crowd is not easy to find on the screen at a rough glance, but once he is found, he shows a very significant difference. The method of painting the sinful Judas mixed among the kind disciples, focusing on movements, postures, expressions, and facial features, is a method that is very consistent with the complexity of reality. Only in this way can it inspire deeper imagination and possess higher educational significance.

Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" was able to far surpass the works of other famous painters on the same subject and become an immortal masterpiece because it was inseparable from his appropriate use of diverse and unified composition methods and his appropriate display of his high attainments in anatomy, perspective, and chiaroscuro techniques, and it was inseparable from his in-depth observation and research of the postures, faces, habits, attitudes, movements, and expressions of various people, thus enriching his necessary activities of imagination. It is inseparable from his love of work, dissatisfaction with existing achievements, fearlessness of all difficulties, and attention to mass criticism [Note 2]. If he were satisfied with the creative methods and technical conventions of his predecessors, if he ignored the complexity of real life and the diversity of human characters, if he were swayed by incorrect opinions and ignored the help of the masses, and was impatient and not serious, this work could not have won such outstanding achievements. At the same time, we cannot ignore that Da Vinci not only used his existing artistic accomplishments in the creative process of his "The Last Supper," but also developed his existing artistic accomplishments. We only need to compare his initial draft [Note 3], which was not particularly original, with the completed work to prove this point. Why did he have to emphatically use diverse and unified methods and painting techniques to give this commonly used subject new life? Why was he able to improve and develop creative methods and painting techniques before this creative task? Why did he have to break through the old set of expression forms of his predecessors and his own initial drafts that were unsatisfactory? It should mainly be explained from the creative purpose and specific theme of this work. That is to say: In order to fully embody his creative intention, it is necessary to create new forms and develop established artistic accomplishments. What is the creative purpose of this work?

Da Vinci created this work for the purpose of improving and consolidating people's good qualities, and for the purpose of drawing a clear line between good and evil. Because only by exposing the contradictions of right and wrong, good and evil, can we effectively inspire and strengthen people's determination and confidence in safeguarding truth and justice, and strengthen hatred and vigilance against traitors who betray the interests of the masses. Not a scholar in the study but a scholar living and acting in actual struggle - Da Vinci, apparently was able to give this not-so-fresh subject new meaning because he gained some new and profound feelings; at the same time, precisely because he clarified the great significance of this theme from the feelings of life, he relentlessly pursued all artistic methods that were adapted to this solemn creative purpose, so this work not only possessed powerful emotional power at the time, but also enabled today's audience, more than four hundred years later, to not regard this work as a religious painting, but to receive beneficial inspiration and education from its solemn theme, so as to strengthen the courage of progressive mankind to defend truth and justice.

For Da Vinci's "The Last Supper," many enthusiasts particularly emphasize its achievements in composition and technique. Da Vinci's achievements in composition and technique are of course beyond doubt and must be valued. However, if we leave its theme and only understand its composition and painting techniques from the form, then it is impossible to deeply understand the greatness of Da Vinci's art. The "Last Supper" by Tintoretto (1518-1594), a famous painter born one year before Da Vinci's death, on the surface, unifies diverse things in consistent light and distance, and the ability to depict objects is obvious. But these strengths cannot make this work reach the level of Da Vinci's art. It prominently depicts the brilliance of the dining hall lights, the busyness of the waiters, the richness of the food, the gluttony of the puppy... These dispensable things seem to make the picture lively on the surface, but in effect form the clutter of the picture, destroying the simplicity of art and failing to make the theme prominent. Rather than describing a sudden event to expose the contradictions of right and wrong, it is more like focusing on recording the bustle and chaos of the small dining hall. Appreciating it in contrast to Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" clearly shows what the main reasons why this work cannot be satisfactory, and can further understand what Da Vinci's artistic excellence mainly relies on.

Da Vinci, who had dissected the corpses of thirty people and did not relax his study of horse anatomy until his old age, needless to say, attached great importance to painting techniques. At the same time, we cannot ignore that Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" and other works, according to the needs of the theme, strictly used techniques without being constrained by techniques, and rationally and flexibly used these techniques. In order to highlight the key points, "The Last Supper" positioned the "vanishing point" of perspective at the head of the main character (Jesus); but at the same time, in order to avoid the excessive prominence of the tableware on the table and hinder the concentration of the theme, he was unwilling to mechanically deal with the unity of the desktop and the background in perspective, and broke through the limitations of focal perspective. For the harmony of the entire picture, he uniformly controlled the light and dark; but at the same time, in order to fully show the essential difference between the traitor Judas and other characters, he boldly placed Judas's face in heavy shadows. Other works such as "Mona Lisa," "Leda," and "Holy Family" have long necks, narrow shoulders, and large eyes for women, all of which are to fully and deeply express the character, identity, psychology, and emotions of the characters, so they exaggeratedly deal with these important parts. This scholar, who does not satisfy himself with explaining nature but takes it as his duty to transform nature, this painter who does not rely on the dexterity of his hands to paint and repeatedly emphasizes the importance of theory and thinking [Note 4], this painter who attaches importance to practice, believes that "knowledge is the son of experience" and "the greatest misfortune is the disconnection between theory and practice," does not separate the application of all technical knowledge from his creative purpose, he is not used by knowledge, but flexibly treats all knowledge.

Da Vinci made the following criticism of painters at the time who were detached from practical needs and dissected for the sake of dissection: The so-called first-class painters, in order to show their knowledge of anatomy, do not hesitate to prominently describe all the muscles, resulting in the human body becoming a bag filled with walnuts or a package filled with radishes; we need to learn anatomy, but we cannot give up other things just to describe muscles. This criticism of those who mechanically use techniques is also proof that Da Vinci, who does not look at problems one-sidedly and superficially, truly scientifically grasps and controls scientific knowledge.

The understanding of Da Vinci's painting techniques must be linked to the creative purpose and specific themes of his various works, and at the same time, it must be based on the effects expressed by the specific works. In order to vividly (that is, characteristically) portray the beautiful image of "Mona Lisa," and to accurately paint the subtle and complex changes in the woman's complexion, etc., he used extremely precise, meticulous, and refined chiaroscuro and colors. But only the line drawing self-portrait of his old age surpasses the "Da Vinci Portrait" (half of the face is covered by the shadow of the hat brim, the author is yet to be determined), which delicately handles the chiaroscuro, in terms of the distinctness of character. Da Vinci's self-portrait, although using line drawing in a sketch-like manner, the solemn posture, the wise and sharp eyes, the affirmative and resolute lips... make the character of this thinker and fighter with unwavering perseverance very prominent and admirable. Although this work is not as detailed as his other works such as "Mona Lisa," it is also accurate, and the line drawing does not detract from its reality and depth. From its overall effect, it is not inferior to other works such as "Mona Lisa": it not only gives the appreciator a deep impression, but also can evoke more associations. If we one-sidedly emphasize the role of chiaroscuro, perspective, and anatomy, and even regard line drawing as an emotionless outline, then we cannot deeply understand Da Vinci's art. We know that only when the author deeply understands the object being described can he develop deep feelings for it; at the same time, only by expressing the spiritual essence of the object with appropriate images can the emotions of the appreciator be aroused. As a condition for forming an image - line drawing or other, does not in itself have the decisive role of whether it can express or inspire emotions, but lies in how to use it.

Da Vinci belongs to the cultural giants that Engels called "not limited by the bourgeoisie." All artists who face reality, have lofty ideals, and are loyal to the people's revolutionary cause love him. Only artists who dare to face reality, have lofty ideals, and are loyal to the people's revolutionary cause are loyal successors of Da Vinci's art, and can carry forward his achievements in painting art. But whether it is to treat "The Last Supper" or his other famous works, whether it is to treat his diverse and unified composition methods and other techniques, if they are "understood" dogmatically and blindly applied, then it would be a disservice to this pioneer - who emphasized the importance of combining theory and practice and opposed following conventions and blindly following - for the valuable knowledge and exemplary work attitude he left us. In order to strengthen new art, the people's artists of New China, like treating their own nation's classic and great art heritage, are learning from the great Da Vinci with correct methods and correct attitudes.

[Note 1] Formerly translated as Da Vinci or Vinci (1452-1519)
[Note 2] In Da Vinci's notes, after repeatedly explaining the importance of mass criticism, he said: "Therefore, you should willingly and patiently listen to other people's opinions, carefully consider and reflect whether other people's criticisms are reasonable. If it is correct, then revise your work, if it is not correct, just treat it as if you don't understand his meaning. If he is a person you respect, you can discuss it with him and make him realize his own mistakes." Taine also quoted the memories of Da Vinci's contemporaries in his lectures introducing Da Vinci: "This painter especially liked those who had seen his works and honestly expressed their opinions."
[Note 3] In the initial draft, Judas's seat had not yet changed to the unnatural situation of Judas in Giotto's works.
[Note 4] In Da Vinci's notes, there are opinions such as "Practice must always be based on sound theory" and "A painter who only paints with his eyes and techniques, without any ideals, is like a mirror, only faithfully reflecting the things placed in front of it, and actually not realizing the existence of these things," emphasizing thought and thinking.

    达·芬奇——现实主义艺术的前驱
    王朝闻
    辽奥纳多·达·芬奇〔注一〕，意大利文艺复兴时期伟大的学者，伟大的艺术家。他拥有广博的学识与卓越的创造才能；为了人类的幸福，勤奋地也是战斗地、自信而又虚心地劳动了一生。仅就绘画这一方面来看，他留下了现实主义艺术不朽的典范。
    达·芬奇发扬了古希腊艺术现实主义的优良传统，提高和丰富了现实主义的创作方法，创造和发展了绘画技法。这一位以发明家自居的天才，十分尊重客观实际，认为“自然是一切大师的最高的指导者”；他无视一切恶意的诽谤，反对依赖前人和模仿前人，认为因袭成规是使艺术衰颓的重要原因。即使是对待宗教的题材，他也不被中世纪以来的成规所束缚，不把神当作没有人性的怪物，不把艺术的造形当成某种教义的符号。他反复地观察、研究了现实的人，并辛勤地探求着与内容相适应的表现形式，因而创造了真实的艺术的形象，改变了中世纪以来那种垂死的公式主义的创作作风。他的著名的杰作“最后的晚餐”，就是使惯用的宗教题材获得了崭新面貌的典型例子，同时也就是使思想、感情与形象取得无间的统一的现实主义艺术的典范。
    为了理解达·芬奇艺术的优越性，不妨把他的
    “最后的晚餐”和意大利其他名画家采用同一题材的作品加以比较。
    从乔多（１２６６—１３３６）到狄·吉尔郎达育（１４４９—１４９８），都是呆板地概念地冷冰冰地处理着“最后的晚餐”这一戏剧性的题材的。这些作者虽然在人物位置的安排、背景的布置和装饰趣味上费了心力（狄·吉尔郎达育甚至把十二位当时佛罗棱斯的活人当作模特儿），但是他们都没有把握住如何适当地表现这一题材的关键，忽视或不理解耶稣“你们中间有一个人将要出卖我”这一突然的宣告如何在性格不同的门徒中引起了不同的反应，没有在叛徒犹大的罪恶尚未完全暴露但即将暴露这一特点上着力，没有使叛徒犹大的姿态动作表情符合这一特殊角色及其所处的特殊环境，没有使耶稣的神情与瞬间的突然变故相结合，基本上没有避免乔多“最后的晚餐”的缺憾。人物漠然地坐着，庄严而无热情，不自然，不真实，结构散漫，背景与人物缺少有机的联系，事件的重点不突出，主题不明确。较达·芬奇晚生三十四年的画家安德烈亚·德尔莎陀（１４８６—１５３１）的同一题材的作品，虽然在许多方面较乔多等人的作品有显著的现实感，但仅就毫无必要地在背景的窗上突出地画两个人因而妨碍主题这一缺点看来，它也远不及达·芬奇的“最后的晚餐”。
    达·芬奇自以为他的画中的耶稣的表情还没有符合自己的理想，因而不认为是完成了“最后的晚餐”这一作品，但它的现实性与感人的力量却是无匹的。有人认为久看它的复制品，感到不只是在看画而是面对人生。这不是无根据的夸张，因为它引导人认识生活。仅就叛徒犹大的形象来看，也就远远超过乔多等人的作品。这不仅因为达·芬奇曾经长时间在现实中十分认真地寻求了和犹大相适应的坏人的性格和像貌，也由于他严格推敲了和犹大这一叛徒脚色相符合的位置和人的相互关系。在乔多等人的画中，几乎都是仅仅依靠坐位的分离和头上不画“圣光”的拙劣方法来使人辨别出犹大；这只是概念地说明他是坏人而不能引起任何实感的画法。在达·芬奇的作品中，和耶稣的无畏的神态相对照，和由于知道自己的领导者被出卖而显示着关心、愤慨、痛惜、自辩、追究的门徒们的激情相对照，犹大的离心和恐慌的神态是被真实地描写出来了。这一混在人群中的败类，粗粗一看不易从画面上发现他，一发现他就显出非常显著的区别。把罪恶的犹大混在善良的门徒中，从动作姿态表情和面型上着力的画法，是十分符合现实的复杂性的画法。只有如此才更能启发更深的想像和具备较高的教育意义。
    达·芬奇的“最后的晚餐”能够远远超过其他名画家的同一题材的作品而成为不朽的杰作，是和他适当地运用多样统一的构图法以及适当发挥他在解剖、透视、明暗诸技法的高度造诣分不开的，是和他深入地观察、研究各种人的身姿、面貌、习惯、态度、动作、表情因而丰富了他的想像力的必要活动分不开的，是和他热爱工作、不满足于既有的成就、不怕一切困难、重视群众批评〔注二〕的工作态度分不开的。如果他满足于前人的创作方法与技法的成规，如果他无视生活实际的复杂性和人物性格的多样性，如果他被不正确的意见所左右和无视群众的帮助，不耐心与不认真，这一作品就不可能赢得如此杰出的成就。同时，我们也不可忽略：达·芬奇在他的“最后的晚餐”的创作过程中，不仅运用着他既有的艺术素养，而且是发展着他既有的艺术素养的。我们只须把他那独创性不突出的初稿〔注三〕和完成的作品相比较，就能够证明这一点。为什么他必须强调地运用多样统一法以及绘画技法来赋予这一惯用的题材以新的生命？为什么他在这一创作任务之前能够提高与发展创作方法以及绘画技法？为什么他必须突破前人以及自己初稿那样不能令人满意的老一套的表现形式？主要应该从他这一作品的创作目的和特定的主题求得解释。这就是说：为了圆满地体现他的创作意图，必须创造新形式，发展既成的艺术修养。什么是这一作品的创作目的呢？
    达·芬奇创造这一作品的目的，是为了提高和巩固人的善良品质；是为了划清善恶是非的界限。因为只有把是非善恶的矛盾加以揭发，然后才能有效地启发和加强人们维护真理与正义的决心和信心，加强对于出卖群众利益的奸徒的憎恨和警惕。不是书斋中的学者而是在实际斗争中生活着和活动着的学者——达·芬奇，显然是由于获得了某种新的深切的感受，所以才能赋予这一并不新鲜的题材以新的意义；同时正因为从生活的感受中明确了这一主题的重大意义，所以才不懈地追求着和这一庄严的创作目的相适应的一切艺术的方法，因而这一作品不仅能够在当时具备着强大的感人力量，而且能使四百多年以后的今天的观众，并不把这个作品当做宗教画来看待，而能从它的庄严的主题受到有益的启示和教育，以加强进步人类保卫真理和正义的斗争勇气。
    对于达·芬奇的“最后的晚餐”，许多爱好者特别着重其构图法与技法上的成就。达·芬奇在构图法和技法上的成就当然是不容怀疑的和必须重视的。但是，如果离开了它的主题，仅仅从形式上了解其构图法和绘画技法，那就不可能深入地理解达·芬奇艺术的伟大。在达·芬奇逝世前一年出生的名画家——丁托莱妥（１５１８—１５９４）的“最后的晚餐”，从表面看，多样的事物统一在一致的光线、距离里，刻画物象的能力是显而易见的。但这些长处不能使这一作品达到达·芬奇艺术的水平。它突出地刻画着食堂灯光的辉煌，侍者的忙碌，食品的丰富，小犬的贪食……这些可有可无的事物表面看来使画面活泼，效果上却形成画面的零乱，破坏了艺术的单纯，不能使主题突出。与其说是在描写突然的事变以揭发是非善恶的矛盾，不如说是在着重记录小食堂的热闹与纷扰。对照着达·芬奇的“最后的晚餐”来欣赏，分明看得出什么是这一作品不能令人满意的主要原因，并且可以进一步了解达·芬奇艺术之杰出性主要依靠着什么来形成。
    曾经解剖过三十个人的尸体、直到老年还不放松马的解剖学的研究的达·芬奇，不消说对于绘画技法是十分重视的。同时我们不可忽略：达·芬奇的“最后的晚餐”以及其他作品，根据主题的需要，严格地运用技法而不为技法所拘束，是合理地同时又是灵活地运用着这些技法的。为了重点突出，“最后的晚餐”把透视的“灭点”位置在主要人物（耶稣）的头部；但同时为了避免桌上食具过分突出、妨碍主题的集中，因而不愿机械地处理桌面与背景在透视法上的统一，突破了焦点透视的限制。为了整个画面的和谐，统一地支配着明暗；但同时为了充分显示叛徒犹大与其他人物本质的区别，大胆地把犹大的面部安置在浓重的暗影里。其他作品如“蒙娜丽莎”、“丽达”、“圣家族”女性的长脖子、削肩头、大眼睛，都是为了充分地深刻地表现人物的性格、身份、心理、感情，所以才夸张地处理着这些重要部分的。这一位不以说明自然为满足而是以改造自然为职志的学者，这一位不是依靠手的灵敏来作画、一再强调理论与思考之重要作用〔注四〕的画家，这一位重视实践、认为“知识是经验的儿子”和“最大的不幸莫过于理论与实践脱节”的画家，一切技法知识的运用不离他的创作目的，他不是被知识所使用，而是灵活地对待一切知识的。
    对于当时脱离实际需要、为解剖而解剖的画家，达·芬奇作了大意如下的指责：所谓第一流的画家，为表示出解剖学的知识，不惜把一切筋肉都突出地加以描写，结果使人体成为装着胡桃的袋子或装着萝卜的包裹；我们是需要学解剖学的，但不能仅只为了描绘肌肉而放弃其他。这种对于机械地运用技法者的指责，也就是不片面地和不表面地看问题的达·芬奇是真正科学地掌握着和支配着科学知识的证明。
    对于达·芬奇绘画技法的理解，必须处处联系着他各个作品的创作目的和特定的主题，同时也就是看具体作品所表现出来的效果。为了生动地（也就是性格地）刻画“蒙娜丽莎”优美的形象，为了准确地绘出妇人的肤泽等等微妙的复杂的变化，他使用了极其精确、细致而又洗练的明暗和色彩。但仅只是线描的老年时期的自画像，在性格鲜明这一点，却超过虽是细致地处理着明暗的“达·芬奇肖像”（半边脸被帽檐的阴影所遮，作者待考）。达·芬奇的自画像，尽管速写似地使用着线描，但那庄重的姿态，那智慧的锐利的眼光，那肯定的坚决的嘴唇……使这一位富于思考和具有不可动摇的毅力的战斗者的性格十分显著和引人敬爱。这一作品虽不如他的其他作品如“蒙娜丽莎”细致，但也精确，线描无损于它的现实性和深刻性。从它的整个效果看，不比其他作品逊色。和其他作品如“蒙娜丽莎”一样：不仅给予欣赏者深刻的印象，而且能够唤起更多联想。如果片面地强调明暗、透视、解剖的作用，甚至于把线描一律看做缺少感情的勾勒，那就不能深入地理解达·芬奇艺术。我们知道：只有作者深刻地理解了描写对象，才能够对它产生深厚的感情；同时，也只有把对象的精神实质用适当的形象表现出来，欣赏者的或种感情才能被激发。作为构成形象的一种条件——线描或其他，本身并无能否表现或激发感情的决定作用，而在于如何运用它。
    达·芬奇是属于恩格斯所谓“不受资产阶级局限”的文化巨人。一切面向现实、具有崇高理想、忠于人民革命事业的艺术家是爱戴他的。也只有敢于面向现实、具有崇高理想、忠于人民革命事业的艺术家，才是达·芬奇艺术的忠诚继承者，才能发扬他在绘画艺术上的成就。但不论是对待“最后的晚餐”或他的其他名作，不论是对待他的多样统一的构图法和其他技法，如果是教条主义地加以“理解”和盲目地加以套用，那就辜负这一位——强调理论与实践相结合之重要、反对因袭和盲从的——前驱者给我们留下的宝贵的知识和模范的劳动态度了。为了壮大新艺术，新中国的人民艺术家，如同对待自己民族的古典的伟大艺术遗产一样，是用正确方法和正确态度来向伟大的达·芬奇学习的。〔注一〕旧译达文西或文西（１４５２—１５１９）〔注二〕达·芬奇的札记中，在反复说明群众批评之重要性以后说：“因此你应该乐意地耐心地听别人的意见，细心地考虑和反省，别人的指责是否有理。如果是对的，就修正你的作品，如果不对，就只当不了解他的意思好了。假如他是一位你所尊敬的人，可以和他讨论，使他发觉他自己的错误。”泰纳在介绍达·芬奇的讲演中也引用过达·芬奇同时代的人的回忆：“这位画家异常喜欢那些看过他的作品的人，很诚实的讲出他们的意见。”〔注三〕在初稿上，犹大的坐位还没有改变像乔多的作品中的犹大那种不自然的情况。〔注四〕达·芬奇在他的札记中，有“实践必须永远以健全的理论为基础”和“画家只凭眼睛和技术作画，而没有任何理想，就好像一面镜子，只将放在它面前的事物原封不动地照进去，实际上并没有意识到这些事物的存在”等等强调思想和思考的意见。
