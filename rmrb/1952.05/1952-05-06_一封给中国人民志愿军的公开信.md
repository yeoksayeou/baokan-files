An Open Letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers

My name is Kenneth L. Inak, an American from Youngstown, Ohio. I was born on January 14, 1925, and am 27 years old this year. I finished high school and studied at university for two years. I was drafted into the Air Force on June 7, 1943. I am now a First Lieutenant Navigator in the 8th Bombardment Squadron, 3rd Bombardment Group, 3rd Air Division, stationed in Gunsan, Korea.

From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM on August 25, 1951, at the Iwakuni Ground School in Japan, I attended a secret course on germ warfare, taught by a civilian named Mr. Wilson. There were 25 of us in the course, including 10 pilots and 15 navigators. By rank, there were four captains, fifteen first lieutenants, and six second lieutenants. Among the pilots, I remember Captain Lymac, Lieutenant Broughton, and Lieutenant Smith; among the navigators, I remember Lieutenant Hardy, Lieutenant Dague, Lieutenant Blanc, Second Lieutenant Gillinski, Second Lieutenant Larson, Captain Nelson, and myself. This course covered various methods of conducting germ warfare: dropping bombs containing insects carrying bacteria, spreading bacterial dust using bombs or spraying, dropping small animals like mice carrying bacteria and insects via parachutes, infecting lakes, marshes, and water sources, and dropping leaflets, papers, pens, soap, food, clothing, and other items carrying bacteria. Bacteria such as typhus, typhoid, malaria (note), yellow fever (note), dysentery, plague, cholera, smallpox (note), and many other diseases could be used. Fleas, flies, lice, mosquitoes, and other insects could be used to spread bacteria. Mice and other small animals could also be used to carry insects and bacteria, such as fleas and plague bacteria. Mosquitoes can carry malaria and yellow fever bacteria, while flies, lice, and fleas can carry bacteria of other diseases. Germ bombs are best dropped from low altitudes and should be flown at low speeds, with a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour and a maximum altitude of 500 feet, using low-altitude horizontal bombing instead of dive bombing. This course was classified as extremely secret.

(Note) The following note was added by Dr. Zhong Huilan, a medical doctor. Dr. Zhong was formerly a member of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in London and a researcher at the Hamburg School of Tropical Diseases in Germany. He is now a professor of internal medicine and a leading expert in tropical and infectious diseases in China. – Interrogator

"The pathogens of yellow fever and smallpox are filterable viruses. The pathogens of various malarias are various malaria parasites. Because the American prisoner lacks medical knowledge, he confuses the pathogens of these diseases with the pathogens of various bacterial diseases."

On January 1, 1952, during routine briefings, Captain Galley, the briefing officer of the squadron operations section, gave us an order in the form of a reminder that we must pay close attention to "non-explosive bombs." In fact, there is no doubt that when germ bombs began to be used, they told us to call germ bombs "non-explosive bombs" to maintain secrecy. Because I had a cold, Lieutenant Hardy replaced me on that mission.

On the night of January 6, 1952, I flew with Captain Amess, the pilot, and Sergeant Quessie, the machine gunner. We flew a B-26 type aircraft as usual. We took off at 3:00 AM on January 7, 1952, and dropped two germ bombs over Huangzhou in North Korea at 4:00 AM. At 5:00 AM, we returned to Gunsan and reported the mission to the Air Force Group Intelligence Office. We reported to the Sergeant that we had dropped two "non-explosive bombs" over Huangzhou. This was just to maintain secrecy; in fact, the superiors already knew that these were all germ bombs.

On the night of January 10, 1952, I again flew with Captain Amess and Sergeant Quessie in a B-26 type aircraft, taking off at 3:00 AM. At 4:10 AM, we dropped four germ bombs over Junghwa in North Korea, and returned to Gunsan at 5:15 AM on January 11, 1952. To maintain secrecy as much as possible, we said in our report to the Sergeant that we had dropped four "non-explosive bombs" over Junghwa City.

Now, I am a prisoner of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and they treat me like a friend. I eat well, dress warmly, receive medical care, have cigarettes to smoke, have sugar to eat, and receive many other kind treatments. From the newspapers of democratic China, I have seen the truth; all these truths and kind treatments clearly show the lies and false war propaganda of Wall Street radio and newspapers, which portrayed the Chinese as barbaric criminals. They made the American soldiers believe that they would be shot after being captured, or even suffer worse. I am now beginning to clearly recognize who are the lovers of peace and who are the warmongers responsible for this inhuman war. I am determined to fight against Wall Street capitalism, to fight for peace, to wash away the guilt in my conscience. I am determined to join the ranks of peace-lovers and determined to be a new person.

    一封给中国人民志愿军的公开信
    【新华社五日讯】美国战俘伊纳克给中国人民志愿军的公开信如下：
    一封给中国人民志愿军的公开信
    我的名字叫凯尼斯·L·伊纳克，是一个来自俄亥俄州杨斯顿的美国人。我生于一九二五年一月十四日，今年二十七岁，我读完了高中，并在大学念了两年。一九四三年六月七日我被征入空军。现在我是第五航空队第三轰炸联队第三轰炸大队第八轰炸中队的一个中尉领航员，驻地是在朝鲜群山。
    一九五一年八月二十五日下午一点至三点，在日本岩国地面学校，我曾听了一次有关细菌战争的秘密课程，该课程是由一个平民威尔逊先生讲授的。我们有二十五个人参加了这课程，其中十名驾驶员及十五名领航员，按级别区分，有四个上尉、十五个中尉、六个少尉。在驾驶员中我记得有莱麦克上尉、白劳顿中尉和斯密特中尉；在领航员中我记得有哈地中尉、戴古中尉、白朗中尉、吉林斯基少尉、拉逊少尉、纳尔逊上尉和我自己。这次课程是讲授有关进行细菌战争的各种不同的方法：或投下沾附细菌的昆虫的炸弹，或利用炸弹或喷射的方法散播细菌尘埃，或以降落伞降落沾附细菌和昆虫的小动物如老鼠之类，或在湖沼及水源中施行细菌传染，或投下传单、纸张、笔、肥皂、食物、衣服和其他带有细菌的物品。这类细菌如斑疹伤寒、伤寒、疟疾（注）、黄热病（注）、痢疾、鼠疫、霍乱、天花（注）和其他许多疾病的细菌都可以被使用。跳蚤、苍蝇、虱子、蚊子和其他的昆虫可被利用以散播细菌。老鼠和其他的小动物也可以被用以沾附昆虫和细菌如跳蚤和鼠疫细菌。蚊子能沾附疟疾和黄热病细菌，苍蝇、虱、跳蚤能沾附其他疾病的细菌。细菌弹最好从低空掷下并应以低速飞行，最快速度是每小时200英里，最高度为500英尺，以低空水平轰炸，而不是滑翔轰炸。这一课程被列为极端秘密。
    （注）下面的注解是钟惠澜医学博士所加的。钟氏以前是伦敦皇家热带医学及卫生学会的会员，德国汉堡热带病学校的研究员。他现在是内科学教授，为中国热带病学及传染病学第一流专家。——审讯者
    “黄热病和天花的病原均为滤过性病毒。各种疟疾的病原为各种不同的疟原虫。因为美国俘虏缺乏医学知识，他把这些疾病的病原和各种细菌病的病原混为一谈。”
    一九五二年一月一日，在给予例行的训令时，大队作战处训令官加莱上尉以顺便提醒的方式给予我们命令，必须密切注意“不爆炸的炸弹”。实际上，毫无疑义的当开始使用细菌弹时，为了保守秘密起见，他们告诉我们将细菌弹称为“不爆炸的炸弹”。因为我患感冒，所以那一次任务是由另一领航员哈地中尉来代替的。
    一九五二年一月六日晚上，我与驾驶员阿麦斯上尉和机枪手屈西军曹一道飞行。我们照常驾驶B—26型的飞机。我们在一九五二年一月七日上午三点钟起飞，四点钟我们在北朝鲜黄州投了两枚细菌弹，五点钟飞返群山，并到空军大队情报处汇报执行任务的情况，我们向军曹报告在黄州投了两枚“不爆炸的炸弹”。这不过是为了保守秘密而已，事实上上级已经明白这都是细菌弹。
    在一九五二年一月十日的晚上，我又同阿麦斯上尉和屈西军曹驾驶B—26型飞机于三点起飞，四点十分在北朝鲜的中和投掷了四枚细菌弹，于一九五二年一月十一日五点十五分回到群山。为了尽可能的保守秘密，我们在向军曹作的报告中说我们曾经在中和城投掷了四枚“不爆炸的炸弹”。
    现在，我做了中国人民志愿军的俘虏，他们待我像朋友一样。我吃得很好，穿得很暖，接受着医药的照顾，有烟抽，有糖吃，还受着许多其他的仁慈待遇。从民主中国的报纸上，我看到了真情；所有这些真情和仁慈的待遇更清楚地显示了华尔街无线电与报纸的谎言和不真实的战争宣传，他们把中国人描绘成了野蛮的罪犯，他们使美国的军队相信说被俘后是会被枪毙的，甚至受到比这更坏的遭遇。我现在开始清楚地认识到谁是和平的爱好者，以及谁是应对这个惨无人道的战争负责的战争贩子。我已下定决心为反对华尔街资本主义，为和平而斗争，来洗刷我良心上的过失。我满怀决心要加入爱好和平的阵营并决心做一个新人。
