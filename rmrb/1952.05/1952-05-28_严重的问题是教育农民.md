    The Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team (now developed into the Zhang Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative) in Daming County, Hebei Province, a banner in the cooperative movement, was organized in 1945. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all members, the active improvement of farming techniques, and the development of sideline production, the team has developed rapidly in recent years. As early as 1950, the team's land yield had exceeded the pre-war level by 20 percent, and the number of members had grown from the original five households to thirty households. Within five years, from 1945 to 1950, the entire team added a total of twenty-two head of livestock, seven large carts, and also jointly purchased seven-inch walking plows, sprayers, and other new-style agricultural tools, as well as insecticides and pesticides. Due to the experience of year-round mutual assistance and the unanimous request of all members, the team developed into an agricultural production cooperative last autumn.

    However, with the development of production and the rise of the economy, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team, like some other mutual aid teams in other places, gradually developed a capitalist tendency to pursue commercial profits and neglect agricultural production the year before last, taking a detour on the road to the development of the New Democratic agricultural economy. Fortunately, with the timely education of the local Communist Party organization, the team corrected this deviation and returned to the path of normal development.

    From the autumn of 1950, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team actually engaged in commercial activities in addition to agricultural production. At that time, when the government was calling for strengthening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team did not take the correct approach of establishing contact with the supply and marketing cooperatives, but instead, on the basis of the original sideline production, proposed using 100 jin of peanut oil as capital and partnered with others to open a cargo station in the nearby Jinshan Town to help the team and nearby farmers sell local products such as peanuts and white oil. Within three or four months, this cargo station earned more than double the profit. From then on, the team members' thinking of "making a fortune through business" developed, and they believed that "doing business makes money quickly, it's better than farming anyway," and thus they relaxed agricultural production. During the spring plowing last year, the team invested 14,000 jin of wheat funds into the cargo station, further expanding the commercial operation, but when planting wheat, there were no funds to purchase fertilizer, resulting in more than 20 jin of bean cake fertilizer being applied less per mu of wheat field. When aphids were a pest last year, the team did not concentrate its efforts on preventing and controlling the pests, but instead extracted 290 workdays to repair houses for the cargo station, resulting in a great reduction in the yield of more than 100 mu of peanuts in the entire team. As a result of being so enthusiastic about doing business and neglecting agricultural production, the team's entire production plan for 1951 was not able to be completed very well. In 1951, the average annual yield of grain per mu of dry land in the entire team was only 318 jin (economic crops were also converted into millet for calculation), which was 82 jin lower than the planned output; the yield of grain per mu of paddy land was 900 jin, which was also 50 jin less than the original planned output. Overall, the progress of the team's land yield last year was minimal compared to the rapid development situation in the years from 1945 to 1950.

    In order to correct the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team's deviation of pursuing commercial profits and neglecting agricultural production, the Communist Party organization in Daming County took a series of measures to conduct serious education for Zhang Xishun and all team members. First, Zhang Xishun was selected to visit the North China Urban and Rural Goods Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin, so that Zhang Xishun could specifically understand the importance of agricultural production in the country's economic construction. The pictures of the happy lives of farmers in Soviet collective farms displayed at the exhibition showed Zhang Xishun the infinite prospects for leading the correct development of agricultural production. This made Zhang Xishun first clearly realize the mistake of pursuing commercial profits and neglecting agricultural production in his team. Then, Sun Jianchen, a member of the Communist Party District Committee of the district where the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team was located, who had personally visited the Soviet Union, was sent to the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team to make a report, introducing the actual experiences of the happy lives of Soviet farmers, and further pointing out the correct direction that the mutual aid team should take to the team members. In addition, the Communist Party branch in the village where the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team was located was ordered to cooperate with Zhang Xishun to further conduct practical class education for the team members, on the one hand pointing out that the team suffered losses in land yield due to the pursuit of commercial profits; on the other hand, explaining the principle of labor creating wealth, explaining that the "organize yourselves" road instructed by Chairman Mao is to enable everyone to create more wealth for the country and themselves, and pointing out that taking the road of speculation and exploitation is shameful for the working people. On this basis, the local Communist Party organization also assisted Zhang Xishun in leading the entire team to discuss the following two important questions: 1. "How should the emancipated peasants love the motherland?" 2. "After the peasants eliminate the feudal exploitation of the landlord class under the leadership of the Communist Party, should they take the capitalist road of not engaging in production and speculation and exploitation, or should they follow Chairman Mao's instruction of 'organize yourselves' and gradually move towards the socialist future of agricultural collectivization?" After such profound and serious education, the class consciousness and patriotism of the members of the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team have been significantly improved, and the thinking of Zhao Jinxiang, a team member who had originally insisted on continuing to engage in commerce, has also changed. He said: "Now I understand, from now on we should produce more grain and cotton to build our country!" Therefore, all the members of the team consciously and voluntarily ended all commercial activities and concentrated their efforts on agricultural production.

    Under the long-term and serious education of the local Communist Party organization, all members of the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team clearly understood the New Democratic agricultural economic development policy, and strengthened their belief in organizing themselves to gradually move towards collectivization and strive for an infinitely bright future. After last autumn, at the unanimous request of all, the Zhang Xishun Mutual Aid Team was reorganized into an agricultural production cooperative. Since then, this mutual aid and cooperative organization has once again been active on the agricultural production front with a brand-new attitude. They resolutely ended commercial activities that harmed agricultural production and harmed the noble character of hard work and bravery of the working people, and invested funds equivalent to 9,000 jin of peanuts and 4,800 jin of beans, as well as profits from the oil extraction sideline business, into agricultural production, purchasing two mules, one large cart, two ten-inch walking plows, and a large amount of fertilizer. In the spring plowing this year, the Zhang Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative, with high production enthusiasm, led more than 80 mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, and many individual farmers in the whole village to formulate patriotic high-yield competition plans, launched a village-wide patriotic production increase competition movement, and at the same time proposed to launch a province-wide agricultural patriotic production increase competition movement to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, labor models, and all farmers in Hebei Province.

    严重的问题是教育农民
    新华社记者    张华
    河北省合作互助运动的旗帜大名县张希顺互助组（现已发展为张希顺农业生产合作社），是一九四五年组织起来的。由于全体组员同心协力，积极改进耕作技术和发展副业生产，几年来，该组发展很快。早在一九五零年，该组的土地产量就已经超过战前水平的百分之二十，组的成员也由原来的五户发展到三十户。从一九四五年到一九五零年的五年之内，全组共计增加了二十二头牲口、七辆大车，并且还伙买了七吋步犁、喷雾器等新式农具和除虫药械等。由于有了长年互助的经验和全体组员一致的要求，去年秋天该组已发展成为农业生产合作社。
    但是，随着生产发展经济上升，张希顺互助组和其他地方的某些互助组一样，前年曾逐渐滋长了一种追求商业利润、忽视农业生产的资本主义倾向，在新民主主义农业经济的发展道路上走了弯路。幸而及时地得到了当地共产党组织的教育，该组才纠正了这种偏向，回到了正常发展的道路。
    从一九五零年秋季开始，张希顺互助组竟在农业生产之外从事商业活动。当时正当政府号召加强城乡物资交流，张希顺互助组没有采取与供销合作社建立联系的正确办法，却在原来所经营副业生产的基础上，提出一百斤花生油做资本，和人搭伙在附近的金滩镇开了个货栈，帮助本组及附近农民推销花生、白油等土产品。在三四个月内，这个货栈就赚了两倍以上的利钱。从此，该组组员们的“经商发财”的思想就发展了，他们认为“作买卖现赚钱，怎么也比种地强”，因而放松了农业生产。去年春耕时，该组又以一万四千斤小麦的资金投入货栈，进一步扩大商业的经营，而在种麦时却没有资金购买肥料，使得每亩麦田少施了二十多斤豆饼肥。去年蚜虫为害的时候，该组不集中力量防治虫害，反而抽出了二百九十个日工去为货栈大修房屋，致使全组的一百多亩花生大大减产。因为这样热中于作买卖，忽视农业生产的结果，该组一九五一年的整个生产计划都没有能够很好地完成。一九五一年，全组旱地全年平均每亩只收粮（经济作物亦折成谷子计算）三百十八斤，比预订产量计划减低八十二斤；水地每亩收粮九百斤，也比原订产量计划少收五十斤。整个说来，该组去年土地的产量较一九四五年至一九五零年间各年的飞跃发展情况，其进步已是微乎其微了。
    为了纠正张希顺互助组追求商业利润、忽视农业生产的偏向，中国共产党在大名县的组织，曾经采取了一系列的办法，向张希顺和全体组员进行了认真的教育。首先是选派张希顺到天津去参观了华北城乡物资交流展览会，使张希顺具体认识到农业生产在国家经济建设中的重要性。展览会上陈列的苏联集体农庄农民幸福生活的图片，给张希顺昭示了领导农业生产正确发展的无限前途。这样就使张希顺首先明确认识到自己组里追逐商业利润，忽视农业生产的错误。接着又派遣曾经亲到苏联参观的张希顺互助组所在区的中国共产党区委会委员孙建臣，到张希顺互助组去作报告，介绍关于苏联农民的幸福生活的实际见闻，并进而给组员们指出了互助组所应走的正确方向。此外，责成张希顺互助组所在村的共产党支部，协同张希顺进一步向组员们切实进行阶级教育，一方面指出该组因追逐商业利润使土地产量受到损失；另一方面说明劳动创造财富的道理，说明毛主席指示的“组织起来”的道路，就是为的使大家能够为国家为自己创造更多的财富，指出走投机剥削的道路，对于劳动人民是可耻的。在这样的基础上，当地的共产党组织又协助张希顺，领导全组讨论了下面两个重要的问题：一、“翻身农民应该怎样爱祖国？”二、“农民在共产党领导下消灭地主阶级的封建剥削后，应该走向不事生产、投机剥削的资本主义道路，还是应该遵照毛主席‘组织起来’的指示，逐步走向农业集体化的社会主义前途？”经过这样深刻的认真的教育，张希顺互助组组员们的阶级觉悟和爱国主义思想都有了显著的提高，原先坚主继续经营商业的组员赵金箱的思想也转变了，他说：“这番我算明白了，今后我们应该多多增产粮食棉花来建设我们的国家！”于是，该组全体组员自觉自愿地结束了全部商业活动，集中力量去进行农业生产。
    在当地共产党组织的长期认真的教育之下，张希顺互助组的全体组员们明确认识了新民主主义农业经济发展的方针，坚定了组织起来逐步走向集体化，争取无限美好的前途的信念。去年秋后，在全体一致的要求下，张希顺互助组改组为农业生产合作社。从此，这个互助合作组织，又以崭新的姿态活跃在农业生产战线上。他们坚决结束了危害农业生产和危害劳动人民勇敢勤劳的高尚品德的商业活动，把相当于九千斤花生和四千八百斤豆子的资金以及榨油副业所得利润，投入农业生产，购买了两匹骡子、一辆大车、两架十吋步犁和大量的肥料。今年春耕中，张希顺农业生产合作社以高度的生产热情带动了全村八十多个互助组、农业生产合作社和许多单干农民，订了爱国丰产竞赛计划，开展了全村的爱国增产竞赛运动，同时向河北全省的农业生产合作社、互助组、劳动模范和全体农民提出了开展全省农业爱国增产竞赛运动的挑战。
