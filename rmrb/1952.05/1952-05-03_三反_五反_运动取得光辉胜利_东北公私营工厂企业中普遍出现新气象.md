The broad masses of workers in Northeast China, after four months of fierce struggle, have achieved a glorious victory in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and an unprecedented new atmosphere is universally emerging in public and private factories and enterprises.

Through the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the masses of workers in Northeast China have undergone tremendous changes in their thinking, and their class consciousness has been universally raised. This is reflected in: clearing away the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and drawing a clearer line with the bourgeoisie; and a stronger sense of responsibility as the leading class. In the past, due to envy of the bourgeoisie's way of life, some workers, shop assistants, and clerks in private enterprises once hoped to "become a boss eventually," and some skilled workers in state-owned factories planned to jump ship to private factories to earn more money and save it up to buy a few machines and open a small factory. But now, everyone who mentions this feels disgusted from the bottom of their hearts.

The improvement of class consciousness is reflected in production, that is, difficulties that could never be solved in production in the past are now being solved; advanced operating methods and advanced experiences that could not be promoted in the past have now been quickly and willingly learned and adopted by the masses of workers; as a result, new production records are constantly emerging. The workers of the Third Paper Mill put forward 856 rationalization proposals in February, ensuring the completion of the first quarter's production plan. Since late February, No. 7 machine in the mill has created a new record of continuous production, and the finished product rate of No. 5 machine has been increased to 97.67%, exceeding the national plan's required finished product rate standard by 15%. Last December, first-class products of the Mechanical Factory No. 6 accounted for only 13.9%, and third-class products reached 11.3%. This February, first-class products have been increased to 98%, and third-class products have been completely eliminated. The bullhead planers produced by the Mechanical Factory No. 1 last year were all third-class products. The workers thought that the equipment was old and that second-class products could not be produced no matter what. During the "Three-Anti" movement, they studied diligently, solved difficulties, and finally assembled the first second-class bullhead planer in March. The Li Xikui shunting method was created at Shenyang South Station, but it was not promoted at the South Station last year; in mid-March of this year, it was finally promoted, which increased the hook-up rate by 15.3% per hook, improved train formation by 15%, and completed the operation rate by 113%.

A new atmosphere is also appearing in private factories. Workers in 31 grain and rice processing factories and 32 oil mills in Shenyang automatically raised the "standard output rate" and urged the capitalists and grain companies to revise the processing contracts. In March alone, the increase in the output rate of oil and rice reduced the processing cost for the country by 538 million yuan. Worker Ying Chuntan said: "In the past, we worked to death, but it was not enough for the capitalists to steal; now it's different, the more products we produce, the more we hand over to the country. So we are happy to do it from the bottom of our hearts." After the "Five-Anti" movement, Fushun Fuda Iron Factory processed steam valves for the Fushun Mining Bureau. Because the workers actively saved for the country, the processing cost was reduced by 30%. Old worker Yang Deshan said:

"In the past, we were deceived by the capitalists, who used chemical solutions and sodium sulfide to stain the steam valves. The quality was not up to standard, but they pretended to be qualified and delivered the goods, which reduced the life of the steam valves from five years to two years. As a result, the capitalists obtained a large amount of illegal profits, but the country suffered serious losses. Now we understand that we are the masters of the country, and we can no longer let the capitalists deceive and steal the country's property."

Through the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, leading cadres in state-owned factories have also eradicated bureaucratic work styles, further relied on the masses of workers, and created a new atmosphere of close contact between leading cadres and the masses of workers. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the processing workshop of the Mechanical Factory No. 5 often stopped working to wait for materials in the first half of the month and rushed to complete tasks in the second half of the month due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres. This not only reduced the quality of products, but also resulted in 8,000 to 9,000 non-production working hours per month, so that the monthly production plan was not guaranteed to be completed. Now, the leading cadres have changed their work styles. When the tasks come down at the beginning of each month, they mobilize all the workers in the workshop to discuss and study how to ensure the completion of the tasks. At the same time, they specifically understand the machine equipment and technical conditions of each production team, and appropriately allocate tasks according to the strength of each team, and finally overcome the shortcomings of the past and put production on the right track.

In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, trade union organizations at all levels in Northeast China purged corrupt and degenerated elements and class dissidents who had sneaked in, purified their ranks, and at the same time, on the basis of extensively strengthening class education, developed a large number of members and grassroots organizations. More than 120 new grassroots organizations have been established in five districts of Shenyang, and more than 3,000 of the 7,000 workers who applied to join the union had been approved to join the union by the end of March. The number of new trade union members developed in Harbin reached more than 10,200. During the "Five-Anti" movement, 2,400 employees of private enterprises in Jinzhou joined the trade union, which exceeded the total number of members who joined the union in the past three years.

The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have politically, ideologically, and economically cleared the way for the working class in Northeast China to launch a larger-scale production increase and economy practice movement in the future. This year's "May 1st" International Labor Day will become a new starting point for the working class in Northeast China to more widely launch a patriotic production increase and economy practice movement and develop labor competitions.

### “三反”“五反”运动取得光辉胜利  东北公私营工厂企业中普遍出现新气象

    “三反”“五反”运动取得光辉胜利
    东北公私营工厂企业中普遍出现新气象
    东北广大工人群众经过四个月来的激烈斗争，已经取得了“三反”和“五反”的光辉胜利，前所未有的新气象正在公私营工厂企业中普遍出现。
    经过“三反”和“五反”运动，东北工人群众在思想上起了巨大的变化，阶级觉悟普遍提高。这就是：清除了资产阶级的思想影响，和资产阶级的界限划分得更清楚了；领导阶级的责任感更加强烈了。过去，由于羡慕资产阶级的生活方式，有些私营企业的工人、店员和职员曾经盼望自己能“熬成一个掌柜的”，有些国营工厂的技术工人曾经打算跳厂到私营工厂去干，想多闹些钱，攒起来，将来弄上几台机器，开个小工厂。可是，现在，谁提起这个都从内心里发生了厌恶。
    阶级觉悟的提高，表现在生产上，那就是过去生产中从来没能解决的困难，现在解决了；过去推广不了的先进操作方法和先进经验，现在已迅速为工人群众所乐于学习和采用了；因之，生产新纪录就接连涌现。第三造纸厂的工人在二月份提出合理化建议八百五十六件，保证了第一季度生产计划的完成。该厂七号机二月下旬起创造了不断头的新纪录，五号机的成品率已提高到百分之九十七点六七，超过国家计划要求的成品率标准百分之十五。机械六厂去年十二月一级产品只占百分之十三点九，三级产品达百分之十一点三，今年二月一级产品已经提高到百分之九十八，并且完全消灭了三级品。机械一厂去年生产的牛头刨都是三级品，工人们都以为设备老了，怎么也作不出二级品来；“三反”中，他们悉心钻研，解决困难，终于在三月份里装配出第一台二级品牛头刨。李锡奎调车法创造于沈阳南站，可是去年在南站却没有推广起来；今年三月中旬，终于推广了，使挂钩率每钩提高了百分之十五点三，编组列车提高了百分之十五，作业率完成了百分之一百一十三。
    在私营工厂里，同样出现着新气象。沈阳市三十一家粮米加工厂和三十二家油坊的工人，自动提高“出品率标准”，督促资方和粮食公司重订加工合同，三月份仅油米出品率一项的提高，就给国家降低加工成本费五亿三千八百万元。工人应春潭说：“过去我们干活，累个死，还不够资本家盗窃的；现在可不同了，多出产品就多交给国家。所以我们从心眼里乐意干。”抚顺福大铁工厂“五反”后为抚顺矿务局加工汽门，由于工人们积极为国家节约，使加工成本降低了百分之三十。老工人杨德山说：
    “过去被资本家欺骗了，用药水硫化碱沾汽门，质量不合格却冒充合格的交货，使汽门寿命由五年减到两年。结果，资本家得到了大量非法利润，国家却受了严重的损失。现在我们懂得了自己是国家的主人翁，就再不能让资本家欺骗盗窃国家的财产了。”
    经过“三反”和“五反”运动，国营工厂的领导干部也革除了官僚主义作风，进一步依靠工人群众，使领导干部和工人群众之间出现了密切联系的新气象。机械五厂加工车间在“三反”运动前，因为领导干部的官僚主义作风，常常前半月停工待料，后半月突击任务，不但使产品质量降低，而且每月非生产的工时要达到八、九千个钟头，以致每月生产计划没把握完成。现在，领导干部改变了作风，每月初任务下来，他们就发动全车间工人讨论，研究怎样保证完成任务，同时具体了解各生产小组的机器设备情况、工人的技术情况，按照各组力量适当分配任务，终于克服了过去的缺点，使生产走上正轨。
    在“三反”和“五反”运动中，东北各级工会组织都清洗了贪污蜕化分子和混进来的阶级异己分子，纯洁了自己的队伍，同时在广泛加强阶级教育的基础上，大量发展了会员，发展了基层组织。沈阳五个区新建立起来的基层组织有一百二十多个，七千名要求入会的工人，到三月底已有三千多人被批准加入了工会。哈尔滨市新发展的工会会员达一万零二百余名。锦州私营企业的职工，在“五反”运动中有二千四百名加入工会，这个数目超过了过去三年入会的总数。
    “三反”和“五反”运动从政治上、思想上、经济上为东北工人阶级今后更大规模地开展增产节约运动扫清了道路。今年的“五一”国际劳动节，将成为东北工人阶级更广泛地开展爱国主义增产节约运动、发展劳动竞赛的新起点。
