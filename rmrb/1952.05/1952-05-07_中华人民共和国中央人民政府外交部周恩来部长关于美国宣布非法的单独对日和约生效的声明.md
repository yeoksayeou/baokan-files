On April 28, 1952, the U.S. government and the Japanese government simultaneously announced that the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan would officially take effect from that date; the Far Eastern Commission in Washington and the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo were both illegally declared dissolved by the U.S. government. On the same day, the Japanese Yoshida government also signed a so-called "peace treaty" with the reactionary remnant group of the Chinese Kuomintang entrenched in Taiwan. This series of serious and blatant provocative acts has aroused unparalleled anger and strong opposition from the people of our country. To this end, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby authorizes me to issue the following statement:

I. The U.S. government, disregarding the international agreements on the Japanese issue such as the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942, the Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, the Potsdam Proclamation and Agreement, the decision of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference of 1945 on the establishment of the Allied Council for Japan, and the Far Eastern Commission's policy decisions regarding Japan after surrender, all of which it personally signed, has arbitrarily announced the entry into force of the separate peace treaty with Japan, which it single-handedly concocted and illegally formulated, and has arbitrarily dissolved the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan. This unilateral measure is completely illegal and completely unreasonable. Ambassador Pan Youxin, the Soviet representative to the Far Eastern Commission, issued a statement on April 28, strongly denouncing the U.S. government's illegal actions. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Soviet government's position and attitude on this issue are completely appropriate and fully in line with the wishes of peace-loving people around the world. In fact, the U.S. government's arrogant and shameful actions have once again proven that the U.S. government can tear up and discard any international obligations and constraints it has promised at any time like waste paper, and its lack of credibility has indeed reached an unprecedentedly serious degree. At the same time, this action also proves that the U.S. government completely disregards the legitimate rights of the countries participating in the Far Eastern Commission, especially the legitimate rights of China, the Soviet Union, and other relevant countries in Asia, and even does not hesitate to blatantly and arbitrarily infringe upon them. The reason why the U.S. government wants to do this is obviously because it is determined to step up preparations for a new war of aggression hostile to China and the Soviet Union and threatening the people of Asia. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the U.S. government's actions of forcibly imposing the illegally formulated separate treaty on the Japanese people and illegally dissolving the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan have further damaged the peace and security of the entire Far East and Asia. The people of the Far East and Asia certainly cannot sit idly by in the face of the new war threats caused by these provocative acts of the U.S. government. In order to defend the peace and security of the Far East and Asia, the Chinese people have continuously exposed the U.S. government's conspiracy to use Japan as a military base, rearm Japan, and organize a Pacific aggressive bloc for several years, and have taken practical actions to counter the U.S. aggression in Korea and the criminal act of occupying our Taiwan. Now that the U.S. government has further undermined peace in the Far East and Asia, the Chinese people are deeply willing to unite even more closely with the people of the Far East and Asia, and work together to stop the U.S. war conspiracy, so that peace and security in the Far East and the world can be guaranteed.

II. The separate peace treaty with Japan concocted by the U.S. government is by no means a treaty to restore Japan's sovereignty, independence, and change Japan's occupied status; on the contrary, it is a war-preparatory and enslavement treaty that completely turns Japan into a U.S. military base and an affiliated country. As early as September 18, 1951, the Chinese government pointed out that "the separate peace treaty with Japan forcibly signed by the U.S. government at the San Francisco Conference without the participation of the People's Republic of China is not only not a comprehensive treaty, but also not a genuine treaty at all. It is merely a treaty to revive Japanese militarism, antagonize China and the Soviet Union, threaten Asia, and prepare for a new war of aggression." The Chinese people have always firmly opposed such a so-called "treaty." Now, along with the entry into force of this illegal treaty, the so-called "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement" also came into effect on April 28. These treaties and agreements have become the bill of sale for the Japanese nation and the net for the U.S. to implement comprehensive military, economic, and political rule over Japan. Under the rule of the U.S. occupiers and their loyal lackey, the Yoshida government, Japan has become a U.S. military bridgehead in the Far East. Countless Japanese war criminals with bloodstained hands have been released or had their purges lifted. Many young Japanese people have been pulled into forming U.S. mercenaries in Japan under the guise of "self-defense." The entire Japanese economy has become an appendage of the U.S. economy, forced to serve the U.S. war economy. Japan is forced to bear a huge portion of the U.S. occupation costs, and the lives of the Japanese people are becoming increasingly impoverished, with the number of unemployed and underemployed reaching over ten million. Japanese militarism and fascist rule have been revived and developed under the support of the U.S. government, depriving the Japanese people of their basic rights and hindering the free, peaceful, and democratic development of the Japanese nation and people. What is especially serious is that, as a result of the implementation of these illegal treaties, Japan has been dragged by the U.S. into a state of open hostility with China, the Soviet Union, and other relevant countries in Asia, which has isolated Japan in Asia. It is very clear that what the separate peace treaty with Japan has given Japan is not independence, but a serious national crisis that plunges Japan into danger and ruin; not peace, but war; not glory, but humiliation. It is precisely for this reason that the Japanese people call April 28, the day the "treaty" took effect, Japan's national humiliation day. In order to save this national crisis, millions of Japanese people have launched and are launching heroic struggles against the illegal Treaty of San Francisco, against imperialist occupation, against war and rearmament, and for Japan's independence and emancipation. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and warmly support this struggle of the Japanese people. The Chinese people firmly believe that the Japanese people's great struggle for the independence, freedom, democracy, and peace of their motherland will surely win final victory.

III. The U.S. government forced the Japanese Yoshida government and the reactionary remnant group of the Chinese Kuomintang in Taiwan to conclude a so-called "peace treaty," obviously attempting to use this so-called "treaty" to unite the two lackeys it has cultivated, vainly attempting to create a military threat to our People's Republic of China. And the Japanese Yoshida government, after accepting the U.S.-made separate peace treaty with Japan that antagonizes China and the Soviet Union and sells out the interests of the Japanese nation, dared to blatantly further follow the orders of its U.S. master, colluding with the remnant Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan, which has long been unanimously abandoned by the entire Chinese people, and even arrogantly and shamelessly said that the "treaty" they signed should "apply to all territories now under the control of the Government of the Republic of China or will be under its control in the future." Immediately after signing the "treaty," it released 88 Japanese war criminals, including the notorious Okamura Neiji, who were guilty of heinous crimes and whose hands were stained with the blood of the Chinese people. This proves that the reactionary rule of Japan, for nearly seven years since the end of World War II in 1945, still has no remorse, and now it is even more determined to follow U.S. imperialism, vainly attempting to continue its conspiracy of armed aggression against China since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, preparing to re-invade the mainland and revive its imperialist rule over the Chinese and Asian peoples. That is to say, the state of aggressive war against the Chinese people by Japan since the September 18th Incident in 1931 has not only not ended, but, with the support of the U.S. government, there is a danger of preparing for a new war of aggression. The Chinese people will never tolerate such arrogant schemes of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, and will heighten their vigilance and prepare to give a serious blow at any time to those war instigators who vainly attempt to invade the territory of our People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have defeated the Japanese aggressors, crushed the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek armed by the United States, and are still fighting alongside the Korean people to repel the U.S. aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Therefore, the Chinese people have full confidence that they can defeat any new aggression plans of the U.S. reactionaries and their lackeys.

Of course, these base acts of the Yoshida reactionary government are absolutely contrary to the wishes of all patriotic Japanese people to end the state of war and restore peaceful relations with the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people are well aware that the reactionary group headed by the Yoshida government in Japan under U.S. occupation cannot represent the Japanese people, just as the reactionary group of the Chinese Kuomintang headed by Chiang Kai-shek in the past could not represent the Chinese people. The Chinese people have expressed and still express that they are willing to live in peace, unite in friendship, trade with each other, and mutually respect national independence and state sovereignty with the Japanese people, in order to guarantee peace in the Far East. Because only in this way is it beneficial to both China and Japan and their peoples.

IV. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China deems it necessary to declare again: We insist that all occupying troops must withdraw from Japan; the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan announced by the United States is absolutely unacceptable; the Yoshida-Chiang Kai-shek "treaty" that openly insults and antagonizes the Chinese people is firmly opposed. The announcement and conclusion of these illegal treaties are a manifestation of the U.S. reactionaries and their lackeys taking another step forward in their conspiracy to create a new war in the Far East. The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as China, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia, including the Japanese people, unite and take on the cause of maintaining peace, they will surely be able to stop the U.S. war conspiracy in the Far East and guarantee peace and security in the Far East and the world.

### 中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长关于美国宣布非法的单独对日和约生效的声明

    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长
    关于美国宣布非法的单独对日和约生效的声明
    一九五二年四月二十八日，美国政府和日本政府同时宣布非法的单独对日和约自该日起正式生效；在华盛顿的远东委员会和在东京的盟国对日委员会都被美国政府非法宣告解散。同日，日本吉田政府与盘据在台湾的中国国民党反动残余集团也签订了所谓“和平条约”。这一系列严重露骨的挑衅行为，已引起了我国人民的无比愤怒和强烈反对。为此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府特授权本人发表下列的声明：
    一、美国政府不顾它所亲手签字的一九四二年一月一日联合国宣言、开罗宣言、雅尔塔协定、波茨坦公告和协定、一九四五年莫斯科外长会议关于设立盟国对日委员会的决定、以及远东委员会对投降后日本之基本政策的决议等有关日本问题的国际协议，竟擅行宣布它所一手包办、非法制定的单独对日和约生效，并专横独断地解散远东委员会和盟国对日委员会，这种片面措施是完全非法，完全没有道理的。对于美国政府的这种非法行动，苏联驻远东委员会代表潘友新大使曾于四月二十八日发表声明，予以痛斥。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为：苏联政府在这个问题上的立场和态度，是完全适当，完全符合于世界爱好和平人民的意愿的。事实上，美国政府这种横暴可耻的行动，又一次证明了美国政府对于它所承诺过的任何国际义务和约束，随时都可以像废纸一样撕碎抛掉，其毫无信义确已达到了空前严重的程度。同时，这种行动也证明了，美国政府对于参加远东委员会各国的正当权利，特别是中国、苏联和亚洲有关各国的正当权利，是根本无视，甚至不惜悍然地任意加以侵犯的。美国政府之所以要这样做，显然是由于它决心要加紧准备敌视中苏两国、威胁亚洲人民的新的侵略战争的缘故。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为：美国政府把非法制定的单独和约强制地加在日本人民头上并非法解散远东委员会及盟国对日委员会的行动，已使整个远东和亚洲的和平与安全遭受到了更进一步的破坏。远东和亚洲人民对于美国政府这些挑衅行为所造成的新的战争威胁，当然不能坐视。为了保卫远东和亚洲的和平与安全，中国人民数年来曾不断揭露美国政府以日本为军事基地、重新武装日本、组织太平洋侵略集团的阴谋，并以实际行动来回击美国在朝鲜进行侵略战争和侵占我国台湾的罪恶行动。值兹美国政府更进一步破坏远东和亚洲和平之际，中国人民深愿更加与远东和亚洲人民团结一致，共同努力，来制止美国的战争阴谋，以求远东和世界的和平与安全能够得到保障。
    二、美国政府包办制造的单独对日和约，决不是什么恢复日本主权、独立和改变日本的被占领地位的条约；恰恰相反，它是彻底变日本为美国军事基地和附属国家的备战条约和奴役条约。早在
    一九五一年九月十八日，中国政府就指出：“美国政府在旧金山会议中强制签订的没有中华人民共和国参加的对日单独和约，不仅不是全面和约，而且完全不是真正和约，这只是一个复活日本军国主义、敌视中苏、威胁亚洲、准备新的侵略战争的条约。”对于这样的所谓“和约”，中国人民一直是坚决反对的。现在，随同这一非法和约的生效，所谓“美日安全条约”和“行政协定”也在四月二十八日同时生效。这些条约和协定成了日本民族的卖身契，和美国对于日本实行军事、经济和政治的全面统治的罗网。在美国占领者及其忠实走狗吉田政府依据上述条约和协定的统治之下，日本已成为美国在远东的军事桥头堡。无数血手未干的日本战犯已被释放或解除整肃。日本的许多青年在“自卫”的名义下被拉去组成美国在日本的雇佣军。日本的全部经济都成了美国经济的附庸，被迫为美国的备战经济服务，日本被迫负担美国占领军费的庞大部分，日本人民的生活因而愈益穷困，失业及半失业人数竟达一千万以上。日本的军国主义和法西斯统治在美国政府扶植之下复活和发展起来，剥夺了日本人民的基本权利，妨害了日本民族和人民的自由、和平和民主的发展。尤其严重的是，由于实施这些非法条约的结果，日本就被美国拖进了与中国、苏联和亚洲有关国家处于公开敌对的地位，这样便使日本在亚洲中孤立了起来。很显然，单独对日和约所给予日本的，不是独立，而是陷日本于危亡的严重民族危机；不是和平，而是战争；不是光荣，而是屈辱。正因如此，所以日本人民才把“和约”生效的四月二十八日称为日本的国耻日。为了挽救这种民族危机，千百万的日本人民已展开了并正在展开着反对旧金山非法和约、反对帝国主义占领、反对战争和重新武装、争取日本独立解放的英勇斗争。中国人民对于日本人民的这个斗争，是深切同情、热烈支持的。中国人民深信，日本人民争取自己祖国独立、自由、民主、和平的伟大斗争定能获得最后胜利。三、美国政府强令日本吉田政府和在台湾的中国国民党反动残余集团缔结所谓“和平条约”，显然是企图用这个所谓“和约”，把它所一手培植的两个走狗联合起来，妄想借此构成对我中华人民共和国的军事威胁。而日本吉田政府于接受了敌视中苏、出卖日本民族利益的美制单独对日和约之后，竟敢公然进一步依照其美国主子的命令，与早为全中国人民所一致弃绝的台湾蒋介石残余集团勾搭一起，甚至狂妄无耻地说他们所订的“条约”应“适用于现在在中华民国政府控制下或将来在其控制下之全部领土”，并在订“约”之后，立即释放双手沾满了中国人民的鲜血的罪大恶极的日本战犯八十八人，包括臭名昭著的冈村宁次在内，这就证明日本的反动统治从一九四五年第二次世界大战结束以来，为期将近七年，仍毫无悔祸之心，现在它更决心追随美国帝国主义，妄图继续其甲午战争以来武装侵略中国的阴谋，准备重新进犯大陆，复活它对中国和亚洲人民的帝国主义统治。这就是说，日本自一九三一年九一八事变以来对中国人民实行侵略战争的状态，不仅并未结束，反而在美国政府扶助之下，有准备进行新的侵略战争的危险。对于美日反动派的这种狂妄图谋，中国人民决不能容忍，并将提高警惕，准备随时给予那些妄想侵犯我中华人民共和国领土的战争挑拨者们以严重的打击。中国人民曾经战胜过日本侵略者，曾经粉碎了被美国武装的蒋介石反动势力，并且还正在和朝鲜人民一道打退了美国向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略。因此，中国人民有充分信心可以击败美国反动派及其走狗们的任何新的侵略计划。
    当然，吉田反动政府的这种种卑劣行为，是与日本所有爱国人民争取与中华人民共和国结束战争状态、恢复和平关系的愿望绝对违反的。中国人民深知，在美国占领之下的日本以吉田政府为首的反动集团不能代表日本人民，正如在过去中国以蒋介石为首的中国国民党反动集团不能代表中国人民一样。中国人民早就表示，现在仍然表示：愿意与日本人民和平相处，友好团结，互通贸易，互相尊重民族独立和国家主权，以保障远东和平。因为只有这样，才是对于中日两个国家和人民都有利益的。
    四、中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为有必要再次声明：我们坚持一切占领军队必须撤离日本；对于美国所宣布生效的非法的单独对日和约，是绝对不能承认的；对于公开侮辱并敌视中国人民的吉田蒋介石“和约”，是坚决反对的。这些非法条约的宣布和订立，是美国反动派及其走狗们在远东制造新的战争的阴谋又向前走了一步的表现。中国人民深信，只要中国、苏联和亚洲一切爱好和平的国家和人民包括日本人民在内团结一致，把维护和平的事业担当起来，那就一定能够制止美国在远东的战争阴谋，保障远东和世界的和平与安全。
    一九五二年五月五日
