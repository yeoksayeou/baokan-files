After being educated through the "Three-Anti" campaign, the class consciousness of state-owned factory workers in Mudanjiang City has been universally enhanced, and new developments have begun to emerge in production.

In the "Three-Anti" campaign, the struggle against corruption and production work in state-owned factories promoted and stimulated each other. In the past, some factories, workshops, and groups consistently failed to meet their targets; during the "Three-Anti" campaign, corrupt elements were purged and punished, leading cadres were educated, work styles were changed, and the enthusiasm of workers was brought into play, greatly increasing production compared to the past. The Iron Factory of the Forestry Bureau consistently failed to meet its targets in the first quarter of each year (because the workload was heavy in January, February, and March); after being educated through the "Three-Anti" campaign, the workers of the factory enhanced their patriotism and sense of responsibility in production. Through competition, they overfulfilled the target in the first quarter of this year.

During the campaign, workers personally witnessed the punishment of some cadres and staff members who were of poor quality and corrupt, and leading cadres who had committed bureaucracy made public self-criticisms, greatly promoting a democratic atmosphere. Workers realized that the "Three-Anti" campaign paved the way for further increasing production and practicing economy, thereby increasing their confidence in the future of national industrialization, strengthening their care for state property, and enhancing their sense of responsibility in production. For example, the vulcanization workshop of the Rubber Factory No. 1 consistently suffered from insufficient water and steam, resulting in the vulcanization time of the vertical vulcanizing machine exceeding the standard time (120 minutes) by 20 minutes. This problem was not solved during last year's campaign to increase production and practice economy. After being educated through the "Three-Anti" campaign, workers realized that wasting production time was a loss to state property, so everyone used their brains to study and overcome the difficulties of insufficient water and steam. As a result of everyone's efforts to find a solution, they realized that it was a pity that the hot water after vulcanization was flowing directly into the sewer. Therefore, they closed the drain pipe under the vulcanizing machine and used a circulating water pump to return the hot water, reducing the loss and increasing the supply of water and steam. As a result, the vulcanization time was shortened to the standard, and the tire production exceeded last year's highest record of increasing production and practicing economy by more than 1%. In the past, technicians at the measuring instrument factory of the Municipal Enterprise Company only assigned tasks to workers and rarely went to the workshop to guide production. After being educated through the "Three-Anti" campaign, they realized that not going to the workshop and combining with workers was a concrete manifestation of bureaucracy. He was determined to change this style and went to the workshop to help spiral plate worker Diao Jiayun implement the multi-tool and multi-edge method, which tripled the output of spiral wine spoons.

Through the "Three-Anti" campaign, the sense of responsibility of leading cadres has been universally strengthened, and they are handling and solving problems more promptly. The recent creation of a new record by Li Hongfu's large cutting group in the molding workshop of the Rubber Factory is an example. In the past, due to the workshop director's bureaucratic leadership of production, the workers' enthusiasm for production could not be brought into play for a long time. The cart used by their group to push cloth rolls had a problem with its wheels, and a request for repair was made, but it was not resolved for a year. The aprons worn by the workers when cutting on the table were worn out, and despite repeated requests, they were not reissued. This increased the difficulty of the work and affected the workers' enthusiasm for production, so the cutting volume often did not reach the quota (1,800 yards). When the workers put large rolls of curtain cloth on the table, even if the curtain cloth was next to the table, they had to use a cart to send it to the table. Sometimes, if the cart was sent to other workshops to deliver small rolls of cloth, all six workers in the group would sit on the table and wait for the cart to return before continuing to work. If there were "semi-vulcanized" (poor quality) parts of the curtain cloth, even though the workers knew that they could be used as outer wrapping cloth for steel rings, they would not use them. Some production technical problems that the workers could solve themselves were not solved; instead, a worker was deliberately sent to find a technician, and the other five people would sit on the cutting board and chat idly. If the output was too low at the end of the night shift, they would find an excuse and note in the remarks column of the production instruction chart: "Production was affected by the failure of the cart for × hours." After being educated through the "Three-Anti" campaign, they realized that treating production in this way was not an attitude of being masters of their own affairs; in addition, the leading cadres of the workshop changed their bureaucratic work style and promptly understood the difficulties and problems in production. The workers' enthusiasm for production was enhanced, and everyone used their best efforts to make up for the past losses. Now, if the cart is sent to deliver small rolls of cloth and does not return, several people will work together to lift the curtain cloth onto the table; if they find "semi-vulcanized" parts during cutting, they will cut it into steel ring outer wrapping cloth, and report to the technician at the end of the shift, asking him to tell the calendering section to pay attention to quality. Due to the active work of the workers, the cutting volume has increased from 1,600-1,700 yards in the past to more than 2,400 yards, creating an unprecedented record.

### “三反”以后领导干部、技术人员、工人觉悟都提高了  牡丹江有些工厂解决了从未解决的问题

    “三反”以后领导干部、技术人员、工人觉悟都提高了
    牡丹江有些工厂解决了从未解决的问题
    牡丹江市国营工厂职工经过“三反”运动的教育，阶级觉悟普遍提高，生产上已开始出现新气象。
    在“三反”运动中，国营工厂反贪污斗争和生产工作互相推动、互相激励。过去部分工厂、车间、小组一贯完不成任务；在“三反”运动中，清除和惩办了贪污分子，教育了领导干部，改变了工作作风，工人的积极性得到了发挥，生产较前大为提高。林务局铁工厂过去年年第一季度完不成任务
    （每年一、二、三月份任务重）；全厂工人经过“三反”运动的教育后，增强了爱国心和生产责任心，经过竞赛，今年第一季超额完成了任务。
    工人在运动中亲眼看见一些品质恶劣贪污腐化的干部和职员被惩办，犯了官僚主义的领导干部当众作了检讨，民主风气大为发扬。工人认识到“三反”运动是给进一步增产节约铺平道路，从而对祖国工业化的前途增加了信心，对国家财富加强了爱护，提高了生产上的责任心。如橡胶一厂硫化车间过去一贯闹水、汽不足，因而立式硫化机硫化时间超过标准时间（一百二十分）二十分钟，这问题在去年增产节约运动时也没解决。经过“三反”运动的教育，工人认识到浪费生产时间是国家财产的损失，因此人人开动脑筋研究，克服水、汽不足的困难。大家努力找窍门的结果，想出硫化完的热水白白从下水道流掉是可惜的；于是他们就把硫化机下面的排水管闭死，用循环水泵把热水返回，减少了损失，增加了水、汽供应量，硫化时间因而缩短，达到了标准，车胎产量超过去年增产节约最高纪录百分之一强。市企业公司衡器工厂技术员过去只往下给工人布置任务，很少到车间领导生产。经过“三反”运动的教育，认识到不到车间和工人结合是官僚主义的具体表现，他决心改变这种作风，到车间帮助旋盘工人刁家运实行多刀多刃法，使旋酒匙产量提高了三倍。
    经过“三反”运动，领导干部的责任心普遍加强了，处理和解决问题及时了。橡胶厂成型车间李洪福大裁断小组最近创造了新纪录就是个例子。过去由于车间主任以官僚主义态度领导生产，工人的生产积极性长期不能发扬。他们小组推送布卷的小车，因轱辘不好使，曾请求修理，但一年也没得到解决；工人在案子上裁活的围裙磨坏了，请求多次，也没给补发。这就增加了工作中的困难，也影响了工人的生产热情，裁断量常达不到定额（一千八百码）。工友们上帘子布大布卷时，就是帘子布在案子旁边，也得用小车往案子上送，有时赶上小车往别的车间送小布卷，全组六名工友就坐在案子上等小车回来再干；帘子布有“半硫化”（质量不好）的部分，工友虽然明知道还可作割钢圈外包布使用，但也不利用。有些生产技术问题工人自己能解决也不解决，故意派一个工友去找技术员，其他五个人都坐在案板上聊闲天。晚间下班如果产量太低，就找个藉口，在生产指示图备考栏里注明：“因小车出故障影响生产×小时。”经“三反”运动的教育，他们认识了这样对待生产不是当家作主的态度；加上车间领导干部转变了官僚主义作风，及时了解生产中的困难和问题，工友们的生产积极性提高了，大家都用最大的努力来弥补过去的损失。现在，小车如果送小布卷没回来，几个人就齐下手把帘子布抬到案子上；如果在裁断中发现“半硫化”地方就裁作钢圈外包布，处理完了在下班时再找技术员汇报，叫他转告压延工段注意质量。由于职工积极工作，裁断量由过去一千六、七百码提高到二千四百多码，创造了空前纪录。
