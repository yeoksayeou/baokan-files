Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th – According to the Korean Central News Agency: The confessions of two U.S.-Li gang paratrooper spies who recently surrendered to the Korean government have once again confirmed the crimes of the U.S. aggressors in carrying out germ warfare. One of these spies is Jin Zhiyuan, 31 years old, originally from Longjingli, Nanpu City, Pingan South Province; the other is Li Changshan, 21 years old, originally from Longshuli, Nanpu City. According to their confessions: In March of this year, they received a month of special agent training at the Lee Seung-man puppet army's special agent agency (HIT) in Daegu. On the night of April 21st, they received orders to take off from Gimpo Airport and parachuted into Zixiali, Nadeok-myeon, Byeokseong County, Hwanghae Province at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 22nd. Relevant departments of the U.S. military and the Lee puppet army ordered them, after landing, to carefully scout the distribution and spread of germ-carrying insects and infectious diseases, centered on Haeju City, as well as the situation of the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army's troops and equipment in the area. They were also ordered to investigate the whereabouts of Van Fleet's son, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, who bombed northern Korea in early April but has not yet returned, and two other air force personnel, and then return to Yongmae Island before May 9th.

After landing, these two spies suffered from being unable to carry out activities. They saw that the situation in the northern part of the Republic was in stark contrast to the dark southern part of Korea ravaged by the U.S.-Li gang, and the real situation of the Korean people's heroic resistance moved them even more. Finally, under the condemnation of their national conscience, they surrendered to the Byeokseong County People's Government. The U.S.-Li gang's conspiracy to send spies to investigate the effects of germ warfare has not only been declared bankrupt once again in the face of the staunchly resisting Korean people, but has also further exposed the invaders' evil faces.

    美李匪军两空降特务招供美国细菌战罪行
    【新华社平壤八日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：最近向朝鲜政府自首的两名美李匪帮的空降特务所作的招供，又一次证实了美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。这两名特务一个是金志源，三十一岁，原籍平安南道南浦市龙井里；另一个是李昌善。二十一岁，原籍南浦市龙水里。据他们供称：今年三月间他们在大邱李承晚伪军特务机关（HIT）受了一个月的特务训练。四月二十一日深夜，他们接到命令，从金浦机场乘机起飞，于二十二日晨三时空降在黄海道碧城郡罗德面紫霞里。美军与李伪军的有关方面命令他们在降落后以海州市为中心，仔细刺探带菌昆虫与传染病的分布与蔓延情形，以及该地区朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军的部队与装备等方面的情况，并命令他们调查四月初轰炸朝鲜北部而迄未返回的美第八军军长范佛里特的儿子与另外两个空军人员的下落，然后在五月九日以前回到龙媒岛。
    这两名特务在降落之后，苦于无法进行活动。他们看到共和国北部的情形和遭受美李匪帮蹂躏的黑暗的朝鲜南部恰成鲜明的对照，朝鲜人民英勇抗战的真实情况更使他们感动，他们终于在民族良心的谴责下向碧城郡人民政府自首。美李匪帮派遣特务调查细菌战效果的阴谋，在坚强抗战的朝鲜人民面前，不但再次宣告破产，而且进一步暴露了侵略者的罪恶面貌。
