Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 24th — In recent days, the American invading army has continuously launched frequent small-scale incursions on the western front and near the Panmunjom neutral zone, but each time they have been resolutely repelled by the high-spirited Korean and Chinese People's Army, and the enemy has suffered serious casualties.

On the night of the 15th, the 1st Marine Division of the American invading army attacked our forward outpost near the neutral zone, about 10 kilometers northeast of Panmunjom, with a company-sized force. Three charges were repelled by our army, and the enemy suffered more than 60 casualties. At 3:00 p.m. on the 16th, the enemy again attacked a mountain position of ours about 14 kilometers northeast of Panmunjom with a company-sized force, but was repelled by us. At 4:20 p.m., the enemy even increased its force to a battalion and continued to attack the area, but was again repelled. The next day, two platoons of the enemy, under the cover of four aircraft, attacked the area again, and were forced to retreat after suffering heavy casualties from the intense fire of our defending troops. In the two days of battle, our army in the area killed or wounded 259 enemy soldiers. On the 17th, an enemy platoon sneaked to a mountain top 2.5 kilometers northeast of Panmunjom and launched an attack on us, but was still crushed by the sudden gunfire of our brave soldiers guarding the neutral zone.

On the morning of the 18th, two platoons of the enemy attacked a mountain position of ours west of Tieyuan, and were repelled after two successive charges, with the enemy suffering more than 40 casualties. At 5:00 a.m. on the 19th, two platoons of the enemy attacked the area again, and were repelled after four successive charges. Finally, the enemy increased its force to three company-sized units and, under the cover of aircraft and tanks, launched a fierce attack on us, but was crushed by our army's tight fire and hand grenades. In this battle, the enemy suffered 151 casualties, while only one of our defending soldiers was injured.

Thirty kilometers southwest of Haeju on the west coast, on the 19th, more than 500 enemy soldiers, supported by naval guns and aircraft, landed in batches and launched an incursion. They were immediately met with a head-on blow from our coastal defense troops and fled in panic on the same day.

    朝中部队坚决击退进犯的敌军
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】美国侵略军近日不断在西部战线及板门店中立区附近发动频繁的小股进犯，但每一次都被斗志昂扬的朝中人民军队所坚决击退，敌军并遭到严重杀伤。
    十五日夜，美国侵略军海军陆战队第一师以一个连兵力袭击板门店东北约十公里、中立区附近某处的我军前哨阵地，三次冲锋都被我军击退，敌军伤亡六十多名。十六日下午三时，敌军又以一个连兵力进犯板门店东北约十四公里处的我某山头阵地，被我击退。四时二十分，敌军竟增至一个营，继续进犯该处，又被击退。次日，敌军两个排在四架飞机掩护下再向该处进犯，遭到我守军炽烈火力的严重杀伤后不支后退。在这两天的战斗中，该地我军毙伤敌军达二百五十九名。十七日，敌军一个排偷偷窜至板门店东北二公里半的某山头向我进犯，仍被保卫中立区的我军勇士们突发的枪火击溃。
    十八日晨，两个排敌军向铁原以西我军某山头阵地进犯，连续冲锋两次都被击退，敌军伤亡四十多名。十九日晨五时，两个排敌军再向该处进犯，四次冲锋都被击退，最后敌军增至三个连兵力在飞机和战车掩护下向我猛扑，都被我军严密火力和手榴弹击溃。在这次战斗中，敌军伤亡一百五十一名，而我守军仅一人负伤。
    在西海岸海州西南三十公里处，十九日敌军五百余名在舰炮和飞机支援下，分批登陆窜犯，立即遭我海防部队迎头痛击，当日即仓皇逃去。
