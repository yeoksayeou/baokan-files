The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government instructs:

Launch a Wheat Bumper Harvest Appraisal Campaign, Summarize Bumper Harvest Experiences, and Prepare for Next Year's Wheat Bumper Harvest

Wheat is our country's main commercial grain. Due to the rapid recovery and development of various production undertakings in recent years, and the significant improvement of people's living standards, the demand for wheat is increasing day by day. To adapt to this new situation and continuously improve people's living standards, agricultural production leading organs in various regions must strengthen their leadership over wheat production, concentrate all efforts, and increase the yield of wheat per unit area. Now that the wheat harvest is approaching, in order to facilitate the promulgation of wheat bumper harvest rewards before the autumn sowing and to better carry out the wheat bumper harvest competition, so as to strive for a greater bumper harvest in the next season of wheat, all regions must seize the season and do the following work well:

1.  Launch a wheat bumper harvest appraisal campaign, summarize and promote bumper harvest experiences: Before the wheat harvest, various regions must deeply publicize the bumper harvest reward policy, inspire the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production ideologically, and launch a wheat bumper harvest appraisal campaign extensively among the masses, based on mutual aid teams. Through comparing patriotism, comparing mutual assistance, comparing technology, comparing crops, and comparing harvests, determine various wheat bumper harvest models in the patriotic production increase competition, investigate bumper harvest typical examples in a timely manner, summarize and disseminate their bumper harvest experiences, in order to eliminate the conservative and complacent thinking of some farmers that "production has reached the top" and enhance their confidence in increasing production. (Detailed investigation materials of bumper harvest typical examples discovered in various regions must be reported to the Ministry for evaluation and awards before mid-July.) When summarizing bumper harvest experiences, special attention should be paid to the experiences of production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in large-scale bumper harvests, in order to reflect the superiority of being organized and guide more farmers to organize in order to achieve universal bumper harvests. Before the autumn wheat planting, various types of training classes should be held during agricultural gaps to train a large number of bumper harvest backbones, and through them, organize the vast number of farmers to learn bumper harvest experiences in various ways, with a view to generally improving wheat cultivation techniques and striving for a greater bumper harvest next year.

2.  Mobilize the masses to do a good job in wheat seed selection: In conjunction with the bumper harvest appraisal campaign, universally mobilize the masses to carry out field ear selection, organize the masses to retain and exchange seeds themselves, and prepare high-quality seeds for autumn sowing. In counties with a foundation in universal selection, rely on the masses to conscientiously do a good job in the village and county-level appraisal work (in areas with severe rust, attention should be paid to selecting rust-resistant and high-yielding varieties), promptly select "county preliminary selection seeds," and establish a good seed breeding and promotion network with county farms as the base point to carry out good seed breeding in a planned way. At the same time, it is also necessary to lead agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and county farms to combine and establish small farms, continuously select and breed good seeds, and propagate and promote them. Only by conscientiously doing these tasks can we ensure the gradual completion of the popularization of good wheat seeds.

3.  Mobilize the masses to cut grass and compost manure in summer and autumn, and do a good job in the supply of fine fertilizer: Applying more fertilizer is the most effective way to increase yield per unit area. At present, the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields is generally insufficient to meet the requirements of bumper harvests. We must use the wheat harvest appraisal campaign to launch a mass upsurge of cutting green grass and composting manure to fully prepare the base fertilizer needed for autumn sowing. Agricultural production leading organs at all levels should cooperate with trade cooperative departments to do a good job in the supply of fine fertilizer for wheat fields to ensure the full supply of fertilizer for autumn wheat planting.

4.  Carry out summer plowing and summer planting in a timely manner to ensure timely sowing of autumn wheat: For wheat fields that grow summer crops, after the wheat harvest, efforts should be made to plow the wheat stubble and sow or transplant rice seedlings as early as possible, and harvest summer crops early to ensure timely wheat planting. For wheat fields that are fallow in the summer, timely deep plowing should be carried out during the hot summer days after the wheat harvest, so that the soil can be fully weathered by the high heat of the sun, improve the fertility of the land, and accumulate sufficient rainwater needed for wheat planting. This is an important measure for bumper harvests of dryland wheat, and should be vigorously promoted in various regions.

    中央人民政府农业部指示
    开展小麦丰产评比运动总结丰产经验
    为明年的小麦丰产作好各种准备工作
    小麦是我国主要的商品粮。由于近年来各项生产事业的迅速恢复与发展，人民生活水平显著提高，小麦的需要量日益增加。为适应这一新的情况，不断提高人民生活水平，各地农业生产领导机关必须加强对小麦增产的领导工作，集中一切力量，提高小麦单位面积的产量。现在麦收即届，为便于在秋播前颁布小麦丰产奖励，更好地开展小麦丰产竞赛，以争取下一季小麦的更大丰收，各地必须抓紧季节，作好下列工作：
    一、开展小麦丰产评比运动，总结与推广丰产经验：在麦收前，各地必须深入宣传丰产奖励政策，从思想上启发群众增产热情，以互助组为基础，发动群众广泛开展小麦丰产评比运动。通过比爱国，比互助，比技术，比庄稼，比收成，在爱国增产竞赛中评定小麦各种丰产模范，及时调查丰产典型，总结并传播他们的丰产经验，用以消除部分农民“生产到顶”的保守自满思想，提高其增产信心。（各地发现丰产典型，务于七月中旬以前将其详细调查材料报部评奖。）在总结丰产经验时，应特别重视生产合作社和互助组大面积丰产的经验，以体现组织起来的优越性，引导更多的农民组织起来达到普遍丰产。在秋季种麦以前，应利用农事间隙举办各种训练班，培养大批丰产骨干，通过他们以各种方式组织广大农民学习丰产经验，以期普遍提高小麦栽培技术，争取明年更大的丰收。
    二、发动群众作好小麦选种工作：结合丰产评比运动，普遍发动群众进行田间穗选，组织群众自留互换，准备好秋播用的优良种籽。在普选有基础的县，要依靠群众，认真作好村县两级的评选工作（锈病严重地区要注意选抗锈丰产的品种），及时选出“县初选种”，并以县农场为基点，建立良种繁殖推广网，有计划地进行良种繁殖。同时还必须领导农业生产合作社、互助组与县农场相结合，建立小农场，连续选育良种，繁殖推广。只有认真作好这些工作，才能保证小麦良种普及工作的逐步完成。
    三、发动群众在夏秋割草沤粪积肥，并作好细肥供应工作：增施肥料是提高单位面积产量最有效的办法。目前麦田施肥数量距丰产要求普遍不足，必须利用麦收评比运动，掀起群众割青草沤粪积肥的热潮，充分准备秋播所需基肥。各级农业生产领导机关应配合贸易合作部门，作好麦田细肥供应工作，以保证秋季种麦肥料的充分供应。
    四、及时进行夏耕夏种，保证秋季小麦适时播种：种夏作的麦地，麦收后应抓紧犁麦茬，及早播种或插秧，提早夏作收获，保证适时种麦。夏季休闲麦地，则应在麦收后及时抓紧伏天深耕，使土壤能借阳光高热，充分风化，提高地力，并可蓄积种麦所需足量雨水，这是旱地小麦丰收的重要措施，各地应大力开展。
