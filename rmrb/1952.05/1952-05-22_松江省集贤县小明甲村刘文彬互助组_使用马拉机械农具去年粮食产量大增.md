Liu Wenbin Mutual Aid Group in Xiaomingjia Village, Jixian County, Songjiang Province
Greatly Increased Grain Production Last Year Using Horse-Drawn Mechanical Farm Tools

The Liu Wenbin Mutual Aid Group in Xiaomingjia Village, Fifth District, Jixian County, Songjiang Province, achieved increased production by using Soviet-style horse-drawn farm tools in both the year before last and last year. The group consists of seven households, with twelve male laborers and eight female laborers, cultivating 48.03 hectares of land. They currently have twelve draft horses and six carts. When this mutual aid group began experimenting with Soviet horse-drawn farm tools in 1950, the members thought the new tools were difficult to use. When it came time to plant wheat, no one wanted to be the first to use them. Group leader Liu Wenbin took the lead in sowing his wheat with a seeder, and most of the group members followed suit. They were very happy to see the seedlings emerge so neatly and green. However, later on, there was a drought, and the wheat planted with the new tools looked slightly yellower than the wheat planted with old plows, and the group members started complaining loudly, saying, "This machine is really hurting us!" At this time, the local Communist Party branch held a branch meeting and decided to help the Liu Wenbin group use the new farm tools better and set an example for the masses. After the meeting, the Party members in the Liu Wenbin group led the members to cultivate the land and fight the drought. In addition, there was a light rain, and the wheat seedlings gradually flourished. In the autumn, the average wheat yield of this group reached 2,500 jin per hectare, 500 jin more than that grown with old farm tools. Even the worst yield was 2,000 jin. From then on, the group members reversed their distrust of the new farm tools and gradually adopted a complete set of horse-drawn farm tools.

Since the Liu Wenbin Mutual Aid Group started using new-style horse-drawn farm tools, the following changes have taken place in the past two years:

First, the cultivated area has been expanded, and a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations has been achieved. Because the new-style horse-drawn farm tools are light and easy to use, women and semi-laborers can participate in field work as much as male laborers. In the past two years, the group's 48 hectares of land have been cultivated by eight women and three "semi-laborers," replacing male laborers and some draft animals, reclaiming 32 hectares of wasteland, and organizing some laborers to work outside, turning the mutual aid group, which was solely engaged in agriculture, into a mutual aid group that combines agriculture and sideline occupations.

Second, activists have been cultivated, laying the foundation for technological improvement. Since using new-style farm tools, the Liu Wenbin Mutual Aid Group has gradually recognized the importance of improving technology and increasing production, and has begun to consciously cultivate production activists within the group. In the past two years, Yang Guizhi, a woman, has been cultivated to become an activist in leading women's production, Li Jinbao has been cultivated to become a leader, and Liu Fengqi has been cultivated to become a technician in using new-style farm tools. These people have become the backbone of the group and have played a leading role in production, making the mutual aid group increasingly consolidated.

Third, the yield per unit area has been increased, and the means of production have been increased. After using new farm tools, the land can be deeply ploughed in autumn, and the yield has increased year by year. In 1951, the wheat yield increased by 24 percent compared to 1950, reaching an average of 3,100 jin per hectare. Liu Wenbin's own eight and a half mu of land yielded 4,260 jin (equivalent to 5,010 jin per hectare), more than double the normal yield. The increase in production has led to the group members' demand for expanded production. In 1951, a total of four horses and two carts were added, and everyone's life gradually became prosperous.

The fact that the Liu Wenbin Mutual Aid Group achieved increased production by using new-style farm tools has had a great impact on the surrounding farmers: in the spring of 1951, 18 mutual aid groups using new-style farm tools were organized in Xiaomingjia Village, and the number of mutual aid groups using complete sets of horse-drawn farm tools in Jixian County expanded to 43, and then to 71 in the autumn. Most of these mutual aid groups are formed by merging small mutual aid groups, and generally have more than 15 laborers, 9 horses, and about 50 hectares of cultivated land. Because these groups are organized primarily around the use of new-style farm tools, they have generally laid a solid foundation for consolidation and development. (Attached picture)

This is a four-row seeder, which can evenly distribute seeds in the ground and make crops grow neatly. A semi-laborer and a draft animal can sow more than 40 mu per day.

    松江省集贤县小明甲村刘文彬互助组
    使用马拉机械农具去年粮食产量大增
    松江省集贤县五区小明甲村刘文彬互助组前年和去年使用苏联式马拉农具，收到了增产的效果。这个组共有七户，有男劳动力十二名，女劳动力八名，耕地四十八点零三垧；现有耕马十二匹，大车六辆。这个互助组在一九五零年开始试用苏联马拉农具时，组员们认为新农具不好使；等到种小麦的时候，谁也不愿先种。组长刘文彬首先带头用播种机把自己的小麦种上，多数组员才跟着使用。他们看见小苗出的又齐又青，非常高兴。但后来遇到天旱，用新农具种的小麦比用旧犁种的稍黄了一些，组员们就大闹起来，都说：“这机器可把咱们坑苦啦！”这时当地中共支部召开了支部会议，决定要帮助刘文彬组更好地使用新农具，给群众做出榜样。会后，刘文彬组内的党员们带动组员铲地抗旱；加上后来落了一场小雨，麦苗逐渐兴旺起来。到了秋后，这个组平均每垧小麦的产量达到二千五百斤，比一般用旧农具种的多产了五百斤。最坏的也打了二千斤。组员们从此扭转不相信新农具的思想，逐步采用了全套马拉农具。
    刘文彬互助组使用新式马拉农具以后，两年来有了以下的变化：
    一、扩大了耕地面积，做到农业和副业结合。因为新式马拉农具轻便好使，妇女和半劳动力都可以和男劳动力一样地参加田间作业。两年来组里的四十八垧地由八名妇女和三名“半劳动力”负责耕种，替换出了男劳动力及部分耕畜，新垦荒地三十二垧，并组织了部分劳动力出外拉脚，使单纯经营农业的互助组变成农副业结合的互助组。
    二、培养了积极分子，给改进技术打下了基础。刘文彬互助组自使用新式农具以后，对改进技术、提高产量逐渐有了认识，开始有意识地培养组内的生产积极分子。两年来培养了妇女杨桂枝成为领导妇女生产的积极分子，培养李进宝成为打头的，培养刘凤岐成为使用新式农具的技术员。这些人都成了组内的骨干，在生产上发挥了带头作用，使互助组日趋巩固。
    三、提高单位面积产量，增加了生产资料。使用新农具后，因土地可以秋耕深耕，产量逐年增加。一九五一年小麦产量比一九五零年又提高了百分之二十四，平均每垧达到三千一百斤。刘文彬自己的八亩半地更收获了四千二百六十斤（合每垧五千零十斤），超过常年产量一倍多。产量的提高引起了组员们扩大生产的要求，一九五一年共添了四匹马、两辆车，大家的生活逐渐走向富裕。
    刘文彬互助组使用新式农具收到增产效果的事实传播出去以后，对附近的农民群众起了很大影响：一九五一年春小明甲村组织了十八个使用新式农具的互助组，集贤县全县使用全套马拉农具的互助组扩大到四十三个，到秋后又扩大到七十一个。这些互助组大部分都是由小型互助组合并起来的，一般组都有十五个以上的劳动力、九匹马、五十垧左右的耕地。这些组因为都是以使用新式农具为主组织起来的，一般都打下了巩固发展的基础。（附图片）
    这是一部四行播种机，它能够使种子均匀地落到地里，使农作物生长整齐。每天一个半劳动力和一匹牲畜可以播种四十多亩。
