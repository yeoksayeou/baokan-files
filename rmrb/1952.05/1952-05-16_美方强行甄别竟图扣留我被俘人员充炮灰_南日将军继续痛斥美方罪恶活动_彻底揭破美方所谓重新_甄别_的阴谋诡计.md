Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 15th: At the plenary session of the Korean armistice talks delegation today, our chief representative, General Nan Ri, continued to denounce the other side's unreasonable and unilateral demand to detain our captured personnel as cannon fodder for their slaughter and enslavement, and exposed the other side's self-deceiving trick of conducting open and joint re-"screening". General Nan Ri's main speech was as follows:

    The ironclad facts of your side's use of violence to forcibly conduct so-called "screening" of our captured personnel to realize your attempt to forcibly detain our captured personnel to act as your cannon fodder have been further confirmed by the statements of your prisoner-of-war camp commanders to our captured personnel. The reason is very clear: if your side's criminal activities of using violence to forcibly "screen" our captured personnel were not intolerable, our captured personnel would not risk collective massacre to make their just demands to your side. If your side's facts of using violence to forcibly "screen" and detain our captured personnel to rearm them as your cannon fodder were not beyond concealment, your prisoner-of-war camp commanders would not guarantee to our captured personnel that they would no longer carry out such criminal activities. Your responsible authorities are trying to deceive the world by saying that your side is unwilling to exchange an armistice at the cost of returning prisoners of war to be slaughtered and enslaved. However, the facts confessed by your prisoner-of-war camp commanders irrefutably prove that it is precisely your side that is willing to pay the price of not having a Korean armistice in order to forcibly detain our captured personnel for your slaughter and enslavement. And in order to achieve this goal, you have placed our captured personnel under constant slaughter and enslavement. Can your side deny that your side disregards the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, violates the lowest standards of human behavior, and commits "insults, torture, forced writing of blood letters, threats, confinement, collective massacres, shootings and machine-gun strafing, and using prisoners of war as experimental subjects for poison gas, bacterial weapons, and atomic bombs" – all these are concrete facts of slaughter and enslavement? Detaining our captured personnel for your slaughter and enslavement is the essence of your April 28 proposal. The heroic struggle of our captured personnel and the statements made by your prisoner-of-war camp commanders have revealed the essence of your April 28 proposal to the whole world. Your side has no excuse to continue to insist on your unreasonable unilateral proposal of April 28, continue to delay the armistice negotiations, and obstruct the realization of the Korean armistice. But at yesterday's meeting, your side once again put forward the absurd method of conducting open and joint re-"screening." Our side has long pointed out that the unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war held by both sides after the armistice is an absolute and unavoidable obligation of the commanders of both sides. No "screening" of prisoners of war is allowed at all. The so-called "screening" itself is absurd. It violates the express provisions of Articles 118 and 7 of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War and violates all international law. "Screening" is absolutely not allowed, let alone in your prisoner-of-war camps, which are full of open and hidden abuse, persecution, and threats, our captured personnel have no freedom to express their free will at all, there is only your violence and massacre, either openly or secretly, directly or indirectly forcing the freedom of our captured personnel. No truly just organization would go to your prisoner-of-war camps to conduct the so-called re-“screening,” which is fundamentally impermissible, to endure your manipulation and insult. Your so-called "screening" is just a self-deceiving trick you use to forcibly detain our captured personnel, which our side resolutely and unshakably opposes. Our side is equally resolutely and unshakeably opposed to your so-called re-"screening." You have already committed a crime by carrying out forced "screening." Do you really expect anyone in the world with a clear head and a just heart to walk into your trap to legitimize your crimes? Since May 2nd, it has been two weeks, and your side has been adopting an unreasonable, non-negotiating, and refusing-to-discuss barbaric attitude in the meeting, trying to force our side to accept your unreasonable unilateral demands. Outside the meeting, you have continuously violated the agreement and engaged in various provocative acts, strafing your own captured personnel, attacking our delegation's vehicles, and attacking the Kaesong neutral zone, causing serious bloodshed many times. Your barbaric attitude and provocative acts can achieve no other purpose than to expose your intention to delay or even disrupt the armistice negotiations to the people of the world. The responsibility for delaying the negotiations lies entirely with your side. Our side has resolutely rejected your unreasonable unilateral proposal of April 28. Our side's May 2 proposal is the only reasonable basis for resolving the prisoner-of-war issue and reaching an armistice agreement. At present, the only thing that is hindering the realization of the Korean armistice is the prisoner-of-war issue. If your side is truly sincere in reaching a Korean armistice, your side has no reason to reject our reasonable compromise proposal of May 2.

    美方强行甄别竟图扣留我被俘人员充炮灰
    南日将军继续痛斥美方罪恶活动
    彻底揭破美方所谓重新“甄别”的阴谋诡计
    【新华社开城十五日电】十五日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军，继续痛斥对方企图扣留我方被俘人员充当炮灰，供对方屠杀与奴役的片面无理主张，揭露了对方所谓进行公开与共同的重新“甄别”的自欺欺人的诡计。南日将军主要发言如下：
    你方对我方被俘人员使用暴力强迫进行所谓“甄别”以实现你方强迫扣留我方被俘人员充当你方炮灰的企图的铁一般的事实，已在你方俘虏营营长对我方被俘人员的声明中得到了进一步的证实。道理很清楚，假使你方使用暴力对我方被俘人员强迫进行“甄别”的罪恶活动，不是到了不能容忍的程度，我方被俘人员是不会冒着遭受集体屠杀的危险，向你方提出他们的正义要求的。假使你方使用暴力进行强迫“甄别”扣留我方被俘人员重新武装他们为你方当炮灰的事实，不是到了不能掩盖的程度，你方战俘营营长是不会向我方被俘人员保证不再进行这种罪恶活动的。你方负责当局企图欺骗世人，说什么你方不愿以遣返战俘使受屠杀与奴役的代价来换取停战。但你方战俘营营长所招供的事实，却无可抵赖地证明正是你方为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员供你方的屠杀与奴役，不惜付出不要朝鲜停战的代价。而你方为了达到这个目的，已经将我方被俘人员置于经常的屠杀与奴役之下。你方能够否认你方不顾日内瓦战俘公约违反人类行为最低标准，对我方被俘人员所进行的“侮辱、酷刑、强迫写血书、威胁、禁闭、集体屠杀、枪杀与机枪扫射，使用战俘为毒气细菌武器和原子弹的试验对象”这一切的罪恶行为是屠杀与奴役的具体事实吗？扣留我方被俘人员供你方的屠杀与奴役，这就是你方四月二十八日方案的实质。我方被俘人员的英勇斗争和你方俘虏营营长所作的声明，已经向全世界揭露了你方四月二十八日方案的实质。你方已没有任何藉口继续坚持你方四月二十八日片面无理的方案，继续拖延停战谈判，阻挠朝鲜停战的实现。但你方在昨日会上，却再次提出了所谓进行公开与联合的重新“甄别”的荒唐办法。我方早已指出停战后无条件遣返其所收容的全部战俘，乃是双方司令官不可逃避的绝对的义务。对于战俘根本就不容许进行任何“甄别”。所谓“甄别”本身就是荒谬的。违反了日内瓦战俘公约第一一八条和第七条的明文规定，违反了一切国际公法。“甄别”根本就是绝对不能容许的，更何况在你方的俘虏营中充满着公开与暗藏的虐待、迫害和威胁，我方被俘人员根本没有任何表现其自由意志的自由，那里只有你方进行暴力行动和屠杀行为，以公开或暗藏、直接或间接强迫我方被俘人员的自由。任何真正的公正机构都不会到你方俘虏营去进行根本不能容许的所谓重新
    “甄别”来忍受你方的玩弄与侮辱。你方的所谓“甄别”，只是你方用以强迫扣留我被俘人员的自欺欺人的诡计，我方坚决不可动摇地加以反对。我方同样坚决不可动摇地反对你方所谓重新“甄别”。你方进行了强迫“甄别”就已经犯了罪。难道你们真期望世界上有什么头脑清醒、心肠公正的人会走进你们设置的圈套，好使你们的罪行合法化吗？自从五月二日以来到现在已有两周，你方在会内一直采取不讲理、不协商、拒绝进行讨论的横蛮态度，企图借此强使我方接受你方片面无理的主张。你方在会外连续破坏协议，进行各种挑衅行为，扫射你方自己的被俘人员，袭击我方代表团车辆，攻击开城中立区，多次造成严重的流血事件。你方这种横蛮态度和挑衅行为，除了向全世界人民暴露你方拖延乃至破坏停战谈判的意图以外，不能达到任何目的。拖延谈判的责任则完全在于你方。我方已经断然拒绝你方四月二十八日的片面无理的方案。我方五月二日的方案是解决战俘问题达成停战协议的唯一的合理基础。目前阻碍朝鲜停战的实现的事实上只有一个战俘问题。如果你方真正有达成朝鲜停战的诚意，你方就没有任何理由拒绝我方五月二日的合理折衷方案。
