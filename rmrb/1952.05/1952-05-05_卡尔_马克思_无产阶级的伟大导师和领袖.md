    Karl Marx - the greatest thinker, a genius theoretician, the founder of scientific communism, the leader of the proletariat, and all progressive humanity will forever remember his name with gratitude.

    Together with F. Engels, Marx scientifically proved the historical transience of the capitalist system and the inevitability of the victory of a new system - the communist system.

    Marx and Engels scientifically demonstrated the idea of ​​the world-historical mission of the proletariat - the most advanced and thoroughly revolutionary class - which, while liberating itself, also has the mission of liberating all mankind from any oppression and exploitation.

    Marx and Engels pointed out the path to socialism - through proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat is an important part of Marxism.

    The founders of Marxism taught that the proletariat cannot defeat the old world and build a new classless society without establishing its own proletarian party.

    The life of Karl Marx is an example of wholehearted service to the proletariat - the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new proletarian society.

    Karl Marx was born on May 5, 1818, in the city of Trier in the Rhine Province of Prussia. After graduating from the Faculty of Law, Marx became the editor of the "Rheinische Zeitung" in 1842, and later became its chief writer. In the pages of this newspaper, Marx appeared as a revolutionary democrat, a mortal enemy of the reactionary Prussian monarchy, and a protector of all workers and oppressed people.

    After the "Rheinische Zeitung" was closed down by the Prussian government, Marx was forced to leave for France. Here he founded the magazine "Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher," in the first issue of which (published in February 1844), Marx appeared as a communist and a revolutionary, calling on the masses, especially the proletariat, to rise up and fight against the existing social and political systems.

    In the noble cause of serving the proletariat, Marx found a loyal comrade and comrade-in-arms in F. Engels. The meeting between Marx and Engels in Paris in 1844 laid the foundation for their close friendship and forty years of common labor.

    Marx and Engels devoted themselves to the study of the new revolutionary materialist world outlook, because this world outlook is the theoretical weapon for the proletariat to wage revolutionary struggle.

    The new theory created by Marx and Engels was first systematically expounded in Marx's famous programmatic document - the "Communist Manifesto," published in February 1848. "The Song of Songs of Marxism" - this is how Comrade Stalin called this classic work of Marx and Engels.

    "In this work," Lenin wrote, "the new world outlook is expounded with genius clarity and brilliance, namely, thorough materialism, including social life, dialectics as the most complete and profound doctrine of development, and the doctrine of the class struggle and the world-historical revolutionary mission of the proletariat, the creator of a new communist society." ("Lenin Collected Works," Volume 21, page 32)

    The new world outlook proclaimed by Marx and Engels marked a fundamental shift, a true revolution, in philosophy, political economy, and the study of human social history.

    Scientific socialism, Marxism - this is a living, constantly developing doctrine - "not a dogma, but a guide to action," as Marx and Engels always emphasized. After elucidating the basic ideas of scientific socialism in the "Communist Manifesto," Marx and Engels summarized the new achievements of science and the new practical experience of the struggle of the proletariat and all working people and oppressed masses, further developing their doctrine and making it more concrete.

    Marx's main work is "Das Kapital," the first volume of which was published in 1867. Marx was the first to reveal the secrets of capitalist exploitation. In "Das Kapital," he proved that in capitalist society, the wealth of the bourgeoisie comes entirely from the surplus value created by workers, which is plundered like a robber. The doctrine of surplus value is the cornerstone of Marx's economic theory.

    "Das Kapital" irrefutably proves that with the development of capitalism, unprecedented wealth and luxury are accumulated at one end, and this wealth and luxury are concentrated in the hands of a small group of capitalist tycoons whose numbers are constantly decreasing, while at the other end, poverty, hunger, and unemployment are increasing, which has become the fate of more and more working masses. In capitalist countries, colonies, and affiliated countries, a negligible handful of people possess countless wealth, while the vast majority of people are so poor that they have no way out. This astonishing contrast is particularly evident in the era of imperialism, under the conditions of capitalist decay and death.

    In "Das Kapital," Marx scientifically proved that all the ills and sores of capitalism are generated by the basic contradiction in capitalist society - the contradiction between the social nature of production and the private capitalist form of ownership. Only proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat can save the working masses from the disasters brought to them by capitalism. The Great October Socialist Revolution is a brilliant confirmation of this scientific prediction of Marx.

    Marx was not only a great scholar, but also a revolutionary and a fighter. Engels said of his friend: "Struggle was his element."

    In the stormy years of 1848-1849, Marx fought for the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution in Germany and for the creation of a unified democratic German republic.

    When analyzing the reasons for the failure of the revolutions in Germany, France, and other countries in 1848-1849, Marx paid special attention to the peasants and their role in the revolutionary struggle. In his famous historical works - "The Class Struggles in France" (1850) and "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" (1852) - Marx came to the conclusion that the only way to free the working peasants from poverty and bankruptcy is through revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the proletariat. "...In the urban proletariat, which is charged with the overthrow of the bourgeois order, the peasants find their natural ally and leader." ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," 1948, Russian edition, Volume 1, page 296)

    These ideas of Marx were later developed by Lenin and Stalin. They put forward and proved the idea of ​​proletarian leadership, the idea that the proletariat leads the urban and rural working masses in the struggle not only against the landlords but also against the capitalists. This great idea of ​​proletarian leadership has been brilliantly confirmed by the experience of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union, and is now being newly confirmed in the various people's democratic countries and in the great Chinese People's Revolution.

    Marx predicted that the proletarian revolution would not only free the peasants from the exploitation of landlords and capitalists, but also bring liberation to all oppressed nations. The "Communist Manifesto" states: "In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to.

    In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end." ("Communist Manifesto," 1948, page 76)

    Marx taught the workers that when they fight against national-colonial oppression, they are not only helping the oppressed nations, but also creating conditions for their own liberation. Marx constantly exposed the plundering policies of the capitalist powers towards colonies and affiliated countries. Marx wrote many articles on the Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion. In these articles, he denounced the pirates' behavior of the invaders and their unjust war against China. Marx and Engels warmly welcomed the Chinese people's national liberation war, considering it as the dawn of a "new era in all of Asia."

    When educating the working class in the spirit of thorough proletarian internationalism, Marx ruthlessly ridiculed the then-popular "theories" that this or that nation was appointed by "God" or "history" to rule the world.

    Marx believed that the proletariat is a class capable of permanently eliminating the wars of plunder or aggression that bring countless disasters to the working masses. Marx wrote: "In contrast to the old society with its economic poverty and political madness, the emerging new society has peace as its international principle, because the same ruler - labor - dominates everyone!" ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," 1948, Volume 1, page 449.)

    The Soviet Union - a powerful fortress of peace, friendship, and unity among all nations - is a living embodiment of this new society.

    Marx believed that the proletariat is the leader of all working people and oppressed people, and the creator of the bright future of mankind, so he fought for the establishment of a proletarian party that can lead the working class to storm capitalism. Marx was the founder of the "Communist League" (1847-1852) and the "First International" (1864-1872), and the leader of the socialist parties that emerged in various countries at that time. Marx devoted particularly much time and energy to leading the German Social Democratic Party and to fighting against the opportunism that arose within the party.

    Marx had hoped to live until the working class, supported by all working people and oppressed people, had completed its world-historical role, that is, the role of the gravedigger of capitalism and the creator of a new socialist society. This expectation of Marx naturally did not come true. Marx passed away on March 14, 1883.

    The task of further studying Marxism and leading the international workers' movement fell to Engels, who lived twelve years longer than his friend.

    The end of the 19th century marked the beginning of a new era in the history of capitalism, that is, the era of imperialism. It is necessary to further develop the revolutionary theory of the proletariat, following the example of Marx and Engels, in the spirit of all their doctrines, and adapting to the new historical conditions.

    "It can be said without exaggeration that after the death of Engels, only the greatest theoretician Lenin, and after the death of Lenin, only Stalin and other Leninist disciples, were the only Marxists who advanced the theory of Marxism, and the only Marxists who enriched the theory of Marxism with new experience under the new conditions of the proletarian class struggle." ("A Concise History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," page 436)

    Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution.

    Marx scientifically proved the inevitable socialist system, which has become a living historical reality on one-sixth of the earth's land. The birth of the people's democratic countries, the great victory of the Chinese people, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the heroic struggle of the colonial people for their own liberation, and the growing movement of peace warriors against the US-British war-mongers, all these are vivid evidence of the growth and consolidation of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    History has brought new victories to the great creative science created by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin time and time again. "Marxism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, and the science of the construction of a communist society." (Stalin: "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics," 1950, pages 54 to 55)

    All attempts by the class that rotted while alive - the bourgeoisie and its despicable and shameless agents, the right-wing social democrats - to "eliminate Marxism" are doomed to failure. No method of barbaric cruelty, whether it be bacteriological warfare or atomic bombs, can save the capitalist tycoons. The working masses of the whole world are even more convinced that the only way to avoid bloody imperialist wars and to avoid hunger, poverty, and unemployment is the path indicated by the great teachers and leaders of the proletariat, Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

    卡尔·马克思——无产阶级的伟大导师和领袖
    苏联  历史科学硕士  斯杰潘诺娃
    卡尔·马克思——最伟大的思想家，天才的理论家，科学共产主义的创始人，无产阶级的领袖，全体进步人类将永远怀着感激的心情记起他的名字。
    和弗·恩格斯一起，马克思科学地证明了资本主义制度在历史上的暂时性质和新的制度——共产主义制度胜利的必然性。
    马克思和恩格斯科学地论证了无产阶级——最先进的彻底革命的阶级——的世界性历史使命的思想，它在解放自己的同时，也负有把全人类从任何压迫、任何剥削中解放出来的使命。
    马克思和恩格斯指出了走向社会主义的道路——通过无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。关于无产阶级专政的学说，是马克思主义中的重要部分。
    马克思主义的创始人教导说，无产阶级如果不建立自己的无产阶级政党，它就不能战胜旧世界和建设无阶级的新社会。
    卡尔·马克思的一生是全心全意为无产阶级——资本主义掘墓人，无产阶级的新社会的创造者——服务的典范。
    卡尔·马克思在一八一八年五月五日诞生于普鲁士莱茵省的居利城。法律系毕业后，马克思在一八四二年担任了“莱茵报”的编辑，后来成了主笔。在这张报纸的篇幅上，马克思作为革命的民主主义者，反动的普鲁士君主政体的死敌，全体劳动者和被压迫人民的保护人而出现。
    在“莱茵报”被普鲁士政府封闭后，马克思被迫出走法国。这里他创办了“德法年书”杂志，在这个杂志的第一期中（出版于一八四四年二月），马克思就作为共产主义者，作为革命者而出现了，他号召群众，首先是无产阶级，起来对现存的社会制度和政治制度作斗争。
    在为无产阶级服务的崇高功绩中，马克思在弗·恩格斯的身上找到了忠实的同志和战友。一八四四年马克思和恩格斯在巴黎的会面，奠定了他们亲密的友谊和四十年共同劳动的基础。
    马克思和恩格斯献身于新的革命的唯物主义世界观的研究工作，因为这个世界观是无产阶级作革命斗争的理论武器。
    马克思和恩格斯所创立的新理论，在马克思主义的著名纲领性文件——一八四八年二月出版的“共产党宣言”——中得到了第一次严整的有系统的阐明。“马克思主义的歌之歌”——斯大林同志这样称呼马克思和恩格斯的这一经典著作。
    “在这部著作里，”列宁写道，“用天才透澈鲜明的笔调叙述了新的世界观，即包括着社会生活在内的彻底唯物论，作为最完备最精深发展观的辩证法，论阶级斗争和共产主义新社会创造者的无产阶级所负全世界历史革命使命的学说。”（“列宁全集”，第二十一卷，三十二页）
    马克思和恩格斯所宣告的新的世界观标志了哲学中、政治经济学中、人类社会历史研究中的根本的转变，真正的革命。
    科学社会主义，马克思主义——这是活的、不断发展的学说——“不是教条，而是行动的指针，”如马克思和恩格斯所始终强调的那样。在“共产党宣言”中阐明了科学社会主义的基本思想之后，马克思和恩格斯总结科学的新成就和无产阶级以及全体劳动者与被压迫群众斗争的新的实践经验，而把自己的学说进一步发展，并使之具体化。
    马克思的主要著作是“资本论”，第一卷出版于一八六七年。马克思第一个揭开了资本主义剥削的秘密，他在“资本论”中证明，在资本主义社会中资产阶级的财富完全是像强盗一样掠夺工人所创造的剩余价值而得来的。关于剩余价值的学说，乃是马克思的经济理论的基石。
    在“资本论”中无可反驳地证明了，随着资本主义的发展，一端积累着空前的财富和奢侈，而这些财富和奢侈又是集中在数量不断减少着的一小群资本的大亨手中，另一端则是增长着贫穷、饥饿和失业，后者已成了越来越多的劳动群众的命运。在资本主义国家中、殖民地和附属国家中，毫不足道的一小撮人拥有数不清的财富，广大的人民则穷得走投无路，这种惊人的对照在帝国主义时代、在资本主义腐朽和垂死的条件下表现得特别明显。
    在“资本论”中，马克思科学地证明，资本主义的一切毛病和烂疮都是资本主义社会的基本矛盾——生产的社会性和占有的私人资本主义形式之间的矛盾——所产生的。只有无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政才能使劳动群众免除资本主义所带给他们的灾难。伟大十月社会主义革命是马克思这一科学预言的光辉的证实。
    马克思不仅是伟大的学者，而且也是革命家和战士。恩格斯谈到自己的朋友时说：“斗争是他的自发力量”。
    在狂风暴雨般的一八四八—一八四九年，马克思为争取德国的资产阶级民主革命胜利，为创立统一民主的德意志共和国而进行了斗争。
    马克思分析一八四八—一八四九年德国、法国以及其他各国革命失败的原因时，曾特别注意到农民及其在革命斗争中的作用。在有名的历史著作——
    “法兰西阶级斗争”（一八五○年）及“拿破仑第三政变记”（一八五二年）——中，马克思得到一个结论：使劳动农民解脱贫穷与破产的唯一道路，就是在无产阶级领导下的革命斗争。“……在负有推翻资产阶级秩序这一使命的城市无产阶级身上，农民找到了自己的天然同盟军和领袖。”（“马克思恩格斯选集”，一九四八年，俄文本第一卷二九六页）
    马克思的这些思想，后来为列宁和斯大林发展了。他们提出和论证了无产阶级领导权的思想，在不单是反对地主而且也反对资本家的斗争中无产阶级领导城乡劳动群众的思想。无产阶级领导权这个伟大的思想，已经为伟大十月社会主义革命和苏联建设社会主义的经验辉煌地证实了，而现在又在各个人民民主国家中，以及在中国的伟大人民革命中得到了新的证实。
    马克思预言说：无产阶级革命不仅使农民摆脱地主与资本家的剥削，而且要把解放带给所有被压迫的民族。“共产党宣言”中说道：“人对人的剥削一消灭，民族对民族的剥削也就会跟着消灭。
    民族内部的阶级对抗一消灭，民族间的敌视关系也就会跟着消灭。”（“共产党宣言”，一九四八年，七十六页）
    马克思教导工人们说：他们进行反对民族——殖民压迫的时候，这不仅是援助了被压迫的民族，而且也是为自身的解放创造条件。马克思曾不断地揭发各资本主义强国对殖民地与附属国的强盗政策。对鸦片战争和太平天国起义，马克思曾写了许多论文。他在这些论文中痛斥侵略者的海盗行为及其反对中国的非正义战争。马克思和恩格斯热烈欢迎中国人民的民族解放战争，认为它是“全亚洲的新时代”的曙光。
    马克思在以彻底的无产阶级国际主义精神来教育工人阶级的时候，无情地嘲讽了那时流行的，说什么这个或那个民族是“上帝”或“历史”任命来统治世界的“理论”。
    马克思认为无产阶级是一个足以永远消除给劳动群众带来无数灾难的抢劫或侵略战争的阶级。马克思写道：“诞生中的新社会与那有着经济贫困和政治疯狂的旧社会相反，它的国际原则就是和平，因为支配每一个人的都是那个同一的统治者——劳动！”（“马克思恩格斯选集”，一九四八年，第一卷四四九页。）
    苏联——各民族间和平、友好、团结的强大堡垒——就是这个新社会的活生生的体现。
    马克思认为无产阶级是一切劳动者与被压迫者的领导者，是人类光辉的未来的创造者，所以他就为建立能够领导工人阶级去冲击资本主义的无产阶级政党而斗争。马克思是“共产主义者同盟”（一八四七—一八五二年）及“第一国际”（一八六四—一八七二年）的创始人，是当时出现于各国的社会主义政党的领导者。为了领导德国社会民主党，为了对党内产生的机会主义作斗争，马克思付出了特别多的时间和精力。
    马克思曾经期望活到一切劳动者与被压迫者所支持的工人阶级把自己具有世界历史意义的作用完成的时候，即把资本主义的掘墓人及社会主义新社会的创造者这个作用完成的时候。马克思的这个期望自然没有能实现。一八八三年三月十四日马克思逝世了。
    进一步钻研马克思主义及领导国际工人运动的任务，便落到比自己的朋友多活十二年的恩格斯的肩头上了。
    十九世纪末叶标志着资本主义历史上一个新时代的开始，即帝国主义时代的开始。必须按照马克思和恩格斯的榜样，以他们的全部学说的精神，适应着新的历史条件来进一步发展无产阶级的革命理论。
    “可以毫不夸大地说，在恩格斯死后只有最伟大的理论家列宁，而在列宁死后，只有斯大林及其他的列宁门生，才是唯一向前推进了马克思主义理论的马克思主义者，唯一在无产阶级阶级斗争新条件下用新经验来丰富了马克思主义理论的马克思主义者。”（“联共（布）党史简明教程”，四三六页）
    列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的马克思主义。
    马克思科学地证明了必不可免的社会主义制度，已在地球六分之一的土地上成为活的历史现实。人民民主国家的诞生，中国人民的伟大胜利，德意志民主共和国的成立，殖民地人民争取自身解放的英勇斗争，和平战士反对美英战争贩子的日益增长的运动，所有这一切乃是和平、民主、社会主义阵营的成长与巩固的鲜明的证据。
    历史为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林创立的伟大创造性的科学一次又一次地带来了新的胜利。“马克思主义是关于自然和社会的发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。”（斯大林：“马克思主义与语言学问题”，一九五○年，五十四页至五十五页）
    活着时即已腐朽了的阶级——资产阶级及其卑鄙无耻的代理人右派社会党人——希望“消灭马克思主义”的一切企图，是注定必然失败的。任何一种野蛮残忍的斗争方法，细菌战也罢，原子弹也罢，都不能挽救资本大亨。全世界的劳动群众更加相信：避免血腥的帝国主义战争，避免饥饿、贫穷与失业的唯一道路，这就是无产阶级的伟大导师和领袖马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林所指示的那条道路。（林谷译）（附图片）
