    CCP Xiaoxian Committee
    Self-Criticism on Neglecting Production Leadership

    Editor:
    The People's Daily published a reader's letter criticizing that our county did not promptly shift to production after the land reform, and that villages were taking turns performing plays, which affected the spring plowing. We immediately conducted a self-examination upon seeing this criticism. After the land reform work in our county was basically completed in early March, cadres and the masses became somewhat lax. The county committee only focused on the "Three-Anti" campaign and neglected the leadership of production. At that time, nearly one hundred rural amateur theater troupes in the county were largely out performing plays, seriously affecting spring plowing production. By early April, we had notified all localities to stop this situation. We also notified all localities to prohibit amateur theater troupes from operating commercially, and only allow performances under the principle of not affecting production. Through these efforts, our county's tendency to neglect production leadership has been completely corrected. However, we must continue to pay attention to prevent similar phenomena from happening again in the future.

### 中共萧县委员会  对忽视生产领导的检讨

    中共萧县委员会
    对忽视生产领导的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报曾刊登读者来信，批评我县在土地改革后没有及时转入生产，各村轮流演戏，影响了春耕。我们看到这一批评后，当即作了检讨。三月初，我县土地改革工作基本结束以后，干部和群众都有些松懈情绪，县委只顾进行“三反”斗争，也忽视了对于生产的领导。当时全县近百个农村业余剧团，大部出动演戏，严重地影响了春耕生产。到四月初，我们已通知各地制止这种情况。我们并通知各地，禁止业余剧团营业，只在不影响生产的原则下，方可演出。经过这番努力，我县忽视领导生产的偏向已经完全纠正。但我们要继续注意，使以后不再发生同类现象。
