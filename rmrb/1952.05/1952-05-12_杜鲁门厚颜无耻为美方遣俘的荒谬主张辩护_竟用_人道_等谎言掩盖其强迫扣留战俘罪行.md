Title: Truman Shamelessly Defends the Absurd U.S. Stance on Prisoner Repatriation, Using Lies Such as "Humanity" to Cover Up His Crime of Forcibly Detaining Prisoners of War

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th—After our chief negotiating representative, General Nam Il, sternly refuted and rejected the U.S. side's so-called "comprehensive solution" proposal on April 28th, U.S. President Truman hastily issued a statement in Washington, desperately trying to defend the extremely absurd U.S. position on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation. In the statement, Truman completely reversed black and white, stubbornly portraying the U.S.'s shameless demand to forcibly detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel as opposition to so-called "forced repatriation," and nonsensically claiming that such "forced repatriation" "would violate basic moral and humanitarian principles, which are the foundation of our actions in Korea." However, anyone who understands the matter and is concerned about the armistice negotiations can see that Truman and his government, who are full of "morality" and "humanity," are precisely the most untrustworthy violators of the Geneva Convention and the most barbaric murderers of prisoners of war.

The U.S. government is a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and it often prides itself on being a "strict observer" of the Geneva Convention. However, searching through the Geneva Convention, one can find neither the strange terms of "voluntary repatriation" and "opposition to forced repatriation" concocted by the likes of Truman, nor the provisions for forcibly detaining prisoners of war under the guise of these strange terms. Moreover, it clearly states: "Prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated without delay after the cessation of active hostilities" (Article 118); "Prisoners of war may not renounce the rights secured to them by the present Convention" (Article 7). Obviously, according to the Geneva Convention, not only is the U.S.'s despicable proposition to forcibly detain prisoners of war completely unfounded, but also the absurd "principle" of so-called "voluntary repatriation" is fundamentally untenable. If Truman himself were not hypocritically talking about "moral" principles, then he should unconditionally release and repatriate all of our captured personnel. However, in reality, the U.S. side not only refuses to release our captured personnel, but goes even further, turning its prisoner of war camp on Koje Island into a "island of terror" filled with torture and killings, using extremely barbaric and cruel methods such as beatings, forced tattooing, and forced application of blood fingerprints to create various so-called "refusal to repatriate" bases, in order to achieve its despicable goal of forcibly detaining a large number of our captured personnel. This fully proves that the U.S. side has perfidiously torn up the Geneva Convention and completely destroyed the principles of international morality. On this point, the reactionary newspapers of the United States and Britain also openly admit it without hesitation. For example, the "New York Post" of April 30th admitted that the "voluntary repatriation" stubbornly insisted upon by the U.S. side "modifies" the Geneva Convention, and questioned whether this "practice of canceling solemn international conventions is advisable." The British "Foreign Report" of April 3rd also admitted that "the act of refusing to repatriate all prisoners of war may be interpreted as a violation of the convention" and "creates an ugly precedent." However, Truman, who violated the Geneva Convention that the U.S. government had personally participated in and created an ugly precedent, shamelessly said that he was upholding the "moral" principle. Isn't this the biggest scam?

As for the "humanitarian" principle in Truman's mouth, it is even more full of bloody smell. On Koje Island, the U.S. side has adopted bloody methods such as barbaric torture, beatings, forced tattooing, blood fingerprints, assassinations, and shootings against our captured personnel. These were all admitted by U.S. reporters in their reports and by U.S. airborne agents captured by us. Are these all "humanitarian"? In the negotiating tent, the U.S. side openly demanded to forcibly detain more than 100,000 of our captured personnel, depriving them of the opportunity to return to their motherland and reunite with their families. Isn't this the most inhumane thing? On the other hand, because the U.S. side insists on forcibly detaining our captured personnel, the armistice negotiations cannot reach an agreement, which also makes it impossible for the enemy prisoners of war in our prisoner-of-war camps who could have been released long ago to return home to this day, making their relatives look forward to their return day and night. What a cruel heart! Is this "humanitarian"? Moreover, it is not just that. The U.S. side has even prepared concentration camps for those American prisoners of war who will be repatriated after the armistice agreement but fail the "loyalty test"! Does the "humanity" in Truman's mouth mean nothing but torture, shooting, and concentration camps? On the contrary, we have always advocated acting in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and both sides should repatriate all prisoners of war who should be repatriated. Moreover, in order to ensure that the prisoners of war can return home and reunite with their families as soon as possible, it is also advocated that those of our captured personnel whose homes are in South Korea and the enemy captured personnel whose homes are in North Korea, if they are willing to return home, may not need to be repatriated and can directly return home to reunite with their relatives. However, all captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the United Nations forces, as well as captured personnel of both sides of the Korean army whose homes are in the areas controlled by their own army, must be fully repatriated. This is the most moral and humane solution. The U.S. imperialists' opposition to this approach only further proves that they are deliberately abandoning morality and destroying humanity.

### 杜鲁门厚颜无耻为美方遣俘的荒谬主张辩护  竟用“人道”等谎言掩盖其强迫扣留战俘罪行

    杜鲁门厚颜无耻为美方遣俘的荒谬主张辩护
    竟用“人道”等谎言掩盖其强迫扣留战俘罪行
    【新华社开城十一日电】在我方首席谈判代表南日将军于五月七日严词驳斥并拒绝了美方四月二十八日的所谓“全盘解决办法”的建议之后，美国总统杜鲁门仓皇地在华盛顿发表一个声明，竭力替美方在战俘遣返问题上的极端荒谬的主张作辩护。杜鲁门在声明中完全颠倒黑白，硬把美方强迫扣留十万以上我方被俘人员的无耻要求，说成是反对所谓“强迫遣返”，并胡说什么这种“强迫遣返”，“将是违反基本的道义和人道原则，而这些原则是我们在朝鲜行动的基础”。但是，任何明白事理和关心停战谈判问题的人都可以看出，满口“道义”、“人道”的杜鲁门及其政府，恰恰正是最无信义的日内瓦公约的破坏者，最野蛮的战俘的虐杀者。
    美国政府是参加了日内瓦公约的，它并经常以日内瓦公约的“严格遵守者”自居。但是，找遍日内瓦公约，人们不但找不到杜鲁门之流所杜撰出来的“自愿遣返”、“反对强迫遣返”的古怪名词以及在这些古怪名词掩盖下的强迫扣留战俘的规定，而且它上面还明明白白地写道：“积极敌对行为终止后，战俘应即予释放和遣返，不得迟延”（第一一八条）；“不论在任何情况下，战俘不能声明放弃本公约所赋予的权利”（第七条）。显然地，按照日内瓦公约，不但美方强迫扣留战俘的卑劣主张毫无根据，而且所谓“自愿遣返”的荒唐“原则”，也根本不能成立。杜鲁门本人如果不是口是心非地高谈什么“道义”原则，那么就应当无条件地释放和遣返我方全部被俘人员。然而，事实上，美方却不但不肯释放我方被俘人员，反而更进一步把它设在巨济岛的战俘营变成了酷刑、枪杀的“恐怖之岛”，用毒打、强迫刺字、强迫盖血指印等极端野蛮而残酷的办法，制造各种所谓“拒绝遣返”的根据，来达到它强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员的卑鄙目的。这充分证明美方已经背信弃义地撕破了日内瓦公约，彻头彻尾地毁坏了国际道义的原则。关于这点，美英的反动报纸，也是公然承认不讳的。例如，四月三十日的“纽约邮报”就承认美方所顽固坚持的“自愿遣返”，是“修改”了日内瓦公约，并怀疑这种“取消庄严的国际公约的做法，是否可取”。四月三日英国的“外事报道”，也承认“拒绝遣返一切战俘之举可能被解释成为破坏公约”，并“创造一个丑恶的先例”。然而，破坏了美国政府曾经亲自参加的日内瓦公约和创造丑恶先例的杜鲁门，居然厚颜无耻地说他是维护“道义”原则的，这岂不是最大的骗局？
    至于杜鲁门口中的“人道”原则，那就更是具有浓厚的血腥气味了。在巨济岛，美方对我方被俘人员采取了野蛮的酷刑毒打、强迫刺字、盖血指印、暗害、枪杀等血腥手段。这些都是美方记者在报道中和被我俘获的美方空降特务所供认的。难道这些都是“人道”吗？在谈判会议的帐篷里，美方公然要求强迫扣留十万以上的我方被俘人员，不让他们有返回祖国和家人团聚的机会。这难道不是最不人道的吗？另一方面，美方因坚持强迫扣留我方被俘人员，使停战谈判不能得到协议，也就使本来早就可以被释放的现在我方俘虏营中的对方战俘至今仍不能回家，使他们的亲人望眼欲穿，这是何等残忍心肠！难道这是“人道”的吗？而且，还不仅仅是这样，美方甚至已给那些在停战协议后将被遣返但通不过“忠诚试验”的美国被俘士兵，准备好了集中营！杜鲁门口中的“人道”也者，难到不是毒打、枪杀、集中营的代名词吗？反之，我方一直主张按照日内瓦公约办事，双方遣返应予遣返的全部战俘。而且，为了照顾战俘们能够早日回家团聚，还主张那些家在南朝鲜的我方被俘人员和家在北朝鲜的对方被俘人员，如本人愿意回家，可以不必遣返而直接回家与亲人团聚。但是志愿军与联合国军被俘人员以及朝鲜军队双方的被俘人员家在本方军队控制地区者都必须全部遣返。这才是最合乎道义、最合乎人道的解决办法。美帝国主义者反对这个办法只有更加证明了它是居心要灭弃道义、摧残人道的。
