    It is necessary to strengthen the organization and leadership of construction workers and patriotic education
    Editor: In basic construction projects, the labor efficiency of construction workers varies greatly. The digging record of Bai Yusheng, a model worker in water conservancy from Ningxia Province, is 29.1 cubic meters, and the average record of their team is 19.5 cubic meters. Last year, the highest digging record of workers at the state-owned Qinghe Farm was 15 cubic meters. A labor team recently投入[put into] to a certain construction site in Tianqiao by the Beijing Public Security Bureau has an average digging record of 1.8 cubic meters in one week. The average digging record of workers hired sporadically at the same construction site is 0.8 to 1 cubic meter. The reasons for their low labor efficiency are: (1) The leadership provides very poor organization and leadership for them, and lacks political education; (2) The working methods are old-fashioned, and advanced experience is not promoted. At a time when the country is about to launch large-scale basic construction, I suggest that the relevant leading construction departments must strengthen the organization and leadership of construction workers and patriotic education to improve their labor efficiency.

### 必须加强建筑工人的组织领导和爱国教育

    必须加强建筑工人的组织领导和爱国教育
    编辑同志：在基本建设工程中，建筑工人们的劳动效率差别很大。宁夏省水利劳动模范白玉生挖土纪录是二十九点一公方，他们小组平均纪录是十九点五公方。去年，国营清河农场工人挖土最高纪录是十五公方。北京市公安局新近投入天桥某工地的一支劳动队伍，一周来平均挖土纪录是一点八公方。而同一工地零星召募的工人，他们的平均挖土纪录则是零点八到一公方。他们劳动效率低的原因是：（一）领导方面对他们组织领导很差，缺乏政治教育；（二）工作方法老一套，没有推广先进经验。在国家将要展开大规模基本建设的时候，我建议：各有关领导施工部门必须加强对建筑工人的组织领导和爱国教育，提高他们的劳动效率。
