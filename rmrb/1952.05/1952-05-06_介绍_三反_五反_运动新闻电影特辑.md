Introducing the News Film Special on the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements
    Zhuang Weizhong
The struggle of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements has achieved great victory, and the news films reporting this movement have also created considerable achievements. This is the reason why the first to fifth issues of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements news film special were quickly produced and were able to be shown in various places in a timely manner during the course of the movement. Because these films closely cooperated with the current political struggle, they played a role in publicizing and educating the broad masses of people. It is fully justified that it is universally welcomed by the audience.
    The news films reflecting the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements demonstrated the policies of the Party and the People's Government, which were implemented in the real struggle, and demonstrated the boiling enthusiasm of the masses of people participating in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles. The film used the different ways of dealing with major embezzlers in the "Beijing Public Trial of Major Embezzlers Conference" to tell people that all major embezzlers and thieves should choose their own path between the death penalty, imprisonment, and exemption from punishment. It did not simply and isolatedly explain the policy by the results of dealing with criminals, but used a considerable amount of space to record the crimes and evidence of the criminals. Through the crimes of illegal merchants Wang Kangnian, Huang Haiquan, Li Yinting, and major embezzlers Xue Kunshan, Song Degui, etc., it vividly illustrated some of the facts of the unbridled attacks of the illegal bourgeoisie against the working class in the past three years. Because the crimes exposed by the film are so conclusive and so infuriating, the film was able to help shatter all lies attempting to defend illegal bourgeois elements in the early stages of the movement, and encourage more people to actively participate in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements; it also strengthened the fighting spirit of the masses during the course of the movement. This is the greatest effect and characteristic of the film.
    The film explains the policies and promotes the victory of the struggle through the images of mass struggles and the evidence of crimes. It is extremely inspiring. It quickly allows you to see on the screen how high the fighting spirit is, how neat the steps are, how clear the goals are, how irresistible the anger of the masses is, and how clear the policy of combining punishment and leniency is when the masses of people, under the leadership of the working class, step onto this newly opened battle line! All of this will strengthen the ideological armament of the masses in the struggle, and also enable all embezzlers and thieves to understand from examples that confessing problems honestly is the only way out, thus making the film one of the forces to promote the movement.
    This is the clear political purpose of the entire news special. From the letters and comments from the audience during the performances in various places, it can be seen that this political purpose has been achieved. The audience has a clearer understanding of the great significance of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements from here. People see from this film that it is impossible to carry out construction and it is impossible for the motherland to become rich and strong if these poisons left over from the old society are not washed away. The fifth issue of the "Three-Anti, Five-Anti Movement News Special" introduced the waste caused by bureaucracy in the leadership of ten universities in Beijing, which also deeply aroused people's attention and vigilance.
    Due to the above content, another feature of the news film special is formed, that is, its complete narrative method. It strives to clearly answer questions for the audience, and explain the process of event development from beginning to end; it not only popularly and appropriately inserts cartoons and picture explanations, but also does not follow the outdated old format. This is a big step forward for China's news film in editing work towards popularization.
    The previous news films - "New China News Weekly" often accommodated many themes and contents in very short sections, so that they often failed to explain the important things to the audience clearly. This also reduced its educational role. This time, the news special changed this shortcoming. Everything is based on the educational role for the audience, and everything is considered for the audience. The principles are explained clearly, and the examples are introduced calmly. These benefits make this news film also have the characteristics of an educational film. Therefore, it has received the attention and welcome of thousands of audiences.
    The reason why this film can achieve these results is inseparable from the improvement of the thinking of film workers after studying the literary rectification. After the literary rectification, film workers have a further understanding of how to implement the policy of popularization first and gradually improve on the basis of popularization in news films. Therefore, the shooting method and editing style of news films have been fundamentally improved. Some incorrect arguments used to be popular among some news photographers, such as someone saying "do not shoot if the light is not good, do not shoot if the conditions are not good, do not shoot if the arrangement is not good, do not shoot if the scene is not good"; in this work, this point of view has been changed, and everything is subject to political requirements. Film workers further overcame the tendency to ignore politics and ignore ideology in the literary rectification, which greatly helped news photography and editing personnel, enabling them to clarify their class stand in their work, and enabling every picture and every explanation in the film to proceed from the perspective of policy.
    Finally, it must be pointed out that the reason why this news special has achieved certain results is not only the result of the efforts of film workers, but also the result of the specific guidance and practical assistance of the leadership departments in various places. Facts have proved that the strong help of the responsible comrades of the actual work departments and relevant agencies and groups to the news film production workers is one of the decisive factors for the success of the news film production work.

    介绍“三反”“五反”运动新闻电影特辑
    庄为重
    “三反”“五反”的斗争获得了伟大的胜利，报道这一运动的新闻电影也创造了相当大的成绩。这就是“三反”“五反”运动新闻电影特辑第一号至第五号的迅速摄制完成，并在运动的进行中能够及时地在各地公演的缘故。由于这些影片密切配合了当前的政治斗争，所以发挥了它对广大人民的宣传教育作用。它受到观众的普遍欢迎，是有充分理由的。
    反映“三反”“五反”运动的新闻电影表现了现实斗争中所贯彻实行的党和人民政府的政策，表现了人民群众参加“三反”“五反”斗争的沸腾的热情。影片用“北京公审大贪污犯大会”中处理大贪污犯的不同方式，告诉了人们：一切大贪污犯及盗窃犯，应当在死刑、徒刑、免刑之间，选择自己的道路。它并没有孤立和单纯地就处理罪犯的结果去交代政策，而是用了相当多的篇幅，去记录罪犯们的罪行、罪证。通过了违法商人王康年、黄海泉、李寅廷及大贪污犯薛昆山、宋德贵等的罪行，形象地说明了三年来不法资产阶级分子对工人阶级猖狂进攻的一部分事实。因为影片所暴露的罪犯们的罪行是如此的确凿，是那样的使人愤怒，就使影片能够在运动的初期帮助粉碎了一切企图为违法资产阶级分子作辩护的谎言，鼓舞了更多的人去积极参加“三反”“五反”运动；也在运动的进行中，坚定了群众的斗志。这是影片的最大的效果和特点。
    影片是通过了群众斗争的形象和罪犯的罪证去解释政策，并促成斗争的胜利的。它带有极大的鼓动性。它迅速地使你在银幕上看见，人民群众在工人阶级领导下一走上这条新开辟的战线，斗志是何等的昂扬，步伐是何等的整齐，目标是何等的清楚，群众的愤怒是多么的不可抵挡，惩办与宽大相结合的政策又多么的明确！所有这些，就会加强群众在斗争中的思想武装，也使一切贪污犯和盗窃犯能从实例中明白了坦白交代问题是唯一出路，从而使影片成为推进运动的力量之一。
    这就是全部新闻特辑的明确的政治目的。从各地上演时的观众来信及评论中，可以看见这一政治目的是达到了。观众从这里更清楚地了解了“三反”“五反”运动的重大意义。人们从这影片中看到，如果不洗清这些旧社会遗留下来的污毒，要进行建设是不可能的，祖国的富强是不可能的。“三反、五反运动新闻特辑”的第五号，将北京十所大学因领导方面的官僚主义所造成的浪费现象介绍出来，也深深地引起了人们的注意和警惕。
    由于以上的内容，造成了新闻电影特辑的另一特征，这就是它的完整的叙述方法。它力求清楚地给观众解答问题，有头有尾地阐明事件发展的过程；既是通俗地、恰当地插进了漫画和图画解说，又不袭用陈腐的旧有的格式。这是我国新闻电影在编辑工作上向着通俗化途径迈进的一大步。
    以前的新闻电影——“新中国新闻周报”经常以很短小的篇幅容纳很多的主题和内容，以致常常不能把其中重要的事情向观众说清楚。这样也就降低了它的教育作用。这次新闻特辑改掉了这个毛病。一切以对观众的教育作用为主，一切替观众着想。道理讲述得清楚，事例介绍得从容。这些好处，就使这次的新闻影片兼有教育影片的特征。所以它受到了千万观众的注意和欢迎。
    这影片所以能获得这些成绩，是和电影工作人员经过文艺整风学习以后思想有所提高的情况分不开的。文艺整风后，电影工作者对于如何在新闻电影上贯彻普及为主、并在普及基础上逐步提高的方针，有进一步的体会。因此，就从根本上改进了新闻电影的拍摄方法和编辑风格。从前曾在某些新闻摄影人员中流行过一些不正确的论调，例如有人在取材时“光线不好不拍，条件不好不拍，布置不好不拍，场面不好不拍”；在这次工作中，就改变了这种观点，成为一切服从政治要求了。电影工作者在文艺整风中进一步地克服了忽视政治、忽视思想的倾向，这就大大地帮助了新闻摄影、编辑人员，使他们在工作中明确了自己的阶级立场，使影片中的每一画面、每一解说，都从政策观点出发。
    最后，必须指出，这次新闻特辑之所以获得了一定成绩，不仅是电影工作者努力的结果，也是各地领导部门的具体指导和实际协助的结果。事实证明各实际工作部门及有关各机关团体的负责同志，对新闻影片摄制工作者的大力帮助，是新闻电影制片工作获得成功的决定因素之一。
