Comrades, dear Chinese friends!

Just now we signed four agreements between the People's Republic of China and our Czechoslovak Republic. Please allow me, on behalf of the delegation of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, to extend warm congratulations on this event of particularly great significance. We attach great importance to this event. These agreements will inevitably further promote cooperation between our two countries in culture, science and technology, and post and telecommunications.

Today's occasion is very moving for all of us. At a time when the imperialist instigators of a new war are using bacteriological weapons with unprecedented barbarity against the heroic Korean and Chinese people, we are here signing four Sino-Czech agreements, demonstrating the will of all peoples to live together in peace and sincere friendship, and in fraternal cooperation; therefore, we believe that the signing of these four agreements is of great significance. Precisely because the signing of these four agreements is of great significance to the friendly relations between our two countries, it is an important and pleasant event for our People's Democratic Czechoslovak Republic. The entire people of Czechoslovakia today are watching with gratitude and approval the signing ceremony of these four agreements held in the capital of the People's Republic of China—ancient and glorious Beijing, because the people of Czechoslovakia eagerly hope that the friendly relations between our Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of China, which have already unfolded in the past short three years, for example, in the cultural field, can lay a solid foundation through the cultural agreement between the two countries.

It can be said that there are already very good relations between China and Czechoslovakia in the cultural field. In the work of the world peace movement, we have more than once had the honor of welcoming outstanding Chinese cultural workers in Prague. We would like to thank these outstanding cultural workers for their friendly assistance to us. These fortunate opportunities have been of great help in developing relations between our two countries. What I want to say first is the New China Exhibition held in Prague in 1950, which attracted the broadest social strata of Czechoslovakia; secondly, the Chinese film exhibition and the participation of Chinese filmmakers in the international film festivals held in Czechoslovakia in 1950 and 1951; and the music festival "Prague Spring" in 1951, in which Chinese singers and musicians participated. The Chinese Youth Art Troupe, which won first prize at the Berlin World Youth and Student Festival for its artistic achievements, is currently performing in Czechoslovakia. We now look back with deep gratitude on the work of promoting our Czechoslovak culture carried out in the People's Republic of China. We are proud to read that the Czechoslovak exhibitions held in Beijing and other cities in China were very successful. We are even happier that the Chinese people can see Czechoslovak films. We attach great importance to the fact that the Chinese translations of our Czechoslovak literary works are very popular in the People's Republic of China, and that our immortal national hero, Julius Fučík, has such a high prestige among the Chinese people, especially the Chinese youth. The mutual love of our two peoples is sufficient to prove the development of friendly relations between the two countries. We need many beautiful words to describe the love of the Czechoslovak people for the Soviet people and the Chinese people, which arises and grows simultaneously with a high degree of solidarity. The Czechoslovak people have watched with friendship the heroic and resolute struggle that the Chinese people have waged for more than twenty years, making great sacrifices. This struggle, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, finally achieved a great victory in 1949. We, the people of Czechoslovakia, are inspired by the victory of the People's China. Today, with warm love for the great China, we are attentively watching the new life in China, and are making ourselves familiar with China's newborn and ancient culture.

Now, our country is widely introducing China: our broad masses of people have read the most precious works of Chinese culture: we would like to thank the Czech Sinologists for this. For example: since 1945, the Czech Republic has published three "Ancient Chinese Poetry", introducing the great treasure of Chinese poetry and the poems of the brilliant ancient Chinese poets to our cultural circles. Our people have been able to read translations of all the famous works of Chinese literature in the new revolutionary period of the Chinese people's great struggle for freedom and in the recent period of building a new democratic new life. Our theaters have staged new scripts by Chinese playwrights. Our Czechoslovak cinemas have screened several moving and excellent Chinese films. The Czechoslovak performing arts groups are singing the most popular Chinese songs "The East is Red" and "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers." And our youth are enthusiastically learning the Chinese folk dance "Yangko."

The cultural relations between China and Czechoslovakia are developing rapidly. The cultural agreement we are signing here will be a solid foundation for Sino-Czech cultural relations and will help the further planned and richer development of Sino-Czech cultural relations.

We believe that the relations between China and Czechoslovakia in all aspects of cultural life, such as literature, art, drama, music, film, radio, recording industry, publishing, etc., will develop very smoothly. The infinite treasures of Chinese culture for thousands of years and the great achievements of the victorious People's China in new creation will help enrich the cultural life of the Czechoslovak working people; we attach great importance to this.

We also attach great importance to the great significance of the remaining three agreements. We believe that the Sino-Czech Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement will become the key to close cooperation and mutual assistance between China and Czechoslovakia in developing all aspects of science and technology, which will help accelerate the development of the productive forces of our two countries, effectively consolidate the world peace camp, and thus safeguard world peace. We believe that the two postal and telecommunications agreements signed now will greatly help enhance the friendship between our two countries. And will effectively serve to comprehensively strengthen the ties between the peoples in the vast areas of the democratic and socialist world.

Finally, I would like to say a few more words on behalf of the Czechoslovak government delegation. It is our supreme honor to be authorized by the Czechoslovak government to sign four Sino-Czech agreements of great significance in Beijing. Therefore, we believe that we must work more loyally to strengthen the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia. This friendship is inseparable from our love for the great Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin. We thank Comrade Stalin for enabling the working people of China and Czechoslovakia to build a better new life today; he has enabled China and Czechoslovakia, although thousands of miles apart, to cooperate closely and join hands, enabling us to move towards a happy socialist future.

I wish the four agreements complete success after they are signed, and shout:

May the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia be consolidated!
Long live the People's Republic of China and the People's Democratic Czechoslovak Republic!
Long live our two beloved leaders: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and President Gottwald of the Czechoslovak Republic!
Long live our two countries' common ally - the great Soviet Union!
Long live our two peoples' best friend, the genius leader of progressive mankind, and the advanced standard-bearer of the world's struggle for peace - the great Stalin!

    柯别茨基团长的讲话
    敬爱的同志们，敬爱的中国朋友们！
    刚才我们签订了中华人民共和国和我们捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间的四个协定，请允许我代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团对于这一具有特别重大意义的事件致以热烈的祝贺。我们对于这一事件是非常重视的。这几个协定必然会进一步促进我们两国之间在文化、科学技术及邮电方面的合作。
    今天的场合使我们都很感动。正当帝国主义新战争挑拨者以旷古未闻的野蛮性使用细菌武器来反对英勇的朝鲜及中国人民的时候，我们在这里签订了中捷四个协定，表现了各族人民要求在和平与诚挚的友谊中，在兄弟般的合作下共同生活的意志；因此我们认为签订这四个协定的意义是非常重大的。正因为这四个协定的签订对我们捷中两国的友好关系有很大的意义，所以对于我们人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国是一件重要而愉快的事件。捷克斯洛伐克全体人民今天以感谢和赞许的心情注视着在中华人民共和国的首都——古老而光荣的北京所举行的这四个协定的签字仪式，因为捷克斯洛伐克人民热望我们捷克斯洛伐克共和国和中华人民共和国之间在过去短短的三年内已经展开的友好关系，例如在文化方面的友好关系，能通过两国之间的文化协定奠定一个巩固的基础。
    捷中两国在文化方面可以说已经有了非常良好的关系。在世界和平运动的工作中我们不止一次地在布拉格荣幸地欢迎了中国优秀的文化工作者。我们要感谢这些优秀的文化工作者以友好的态度给我们的协助。这些幸运的机会对于发展我们两国关系的帮助是很大的。我想说的，首先就是一九五○年在布拉格举办的新中国展览会，这个展览会吸引了捷克斯洛伐克最广泛的社会阶层；其次就是举办了中国电影展览和中国电影工作者参加了一九五○年和一九五一年在捷克斯洛伐克举行的国际电影节；以及一九五一年中国歌唱家和音乐家参加的音乐节—“布拉格之春”。由于艺术上的成就而在柏林世界青年与学生联欢节上获得一等奖的中国青年文工团，目前正在捷克斯洛伐克演出。我们现在以深切感谢的心情回顾在中华人民共和国所进行的关于我们捷克斯洛伐克文化的宣传工作。我们以读到在北京和中国其他城市所举行的捷克斯洛伐克展览会非常成功的消息而自豪。我们更高兴中国的社会人士能看到捷克斯洛伐克的影片。我们捷克斯洛伐克文学作品的中译本在中华人民共和国大受欢迎，而我国永垂不朽的民族英雄伏契克在中国人民，特别是中国青年中间有着这样高的威望，我们对这一切都非常重视。我们两国人民的相互热爱已足以证明两国友好关系的发展。我们需要很多优美的辞句来描写捷克斯洛伐克人民对苏联人民与中国人民的热爱，这种热爱是和高度的团结性同时发生和滋长的。捷克斯洛伐克人民曾满怀友情注视着中国人民二十多年来所进行的付出了重大牺牲的、英勇而坚决的斗争。这个斗争在光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下终于在一九四九年取得了伟大的胜利。我们捷克斯洛伐克的人民为人民中国的胜利所鼓舞。今天对于伟大的中国怀着热烈的友爱，关切地注视着中国的新生活，并且正在使自己熟悉中国新生的和古老的文化。
    现在，我国正在广泛地介绍中国：我国广大人民读到了中国文化上最珍贵的作品：关于这一点我们要向捷克斯洛伐克的汉学家们致谢。举例说：一九四五年以来，捷克出版了三部“中国古代诗歌”，把中国诗歌的伟大宝藏和中国古代光辉诗人的诗篇介绍给我国文化界。我国人民已经能够读到在中国人民争取自由的伟大斗争的新的革命时期和最近建设新民主主义的新生活的时期中中国文学上的全部著名作品的翻译本。我国剧院演出了中国戏剧作家的新剧本。我们捷克斯洛伐克的电影院放映了好几部令人感动的优秀的中国影片。捷克斯洛伐克的文工团唱着最流行的中国歌曲“东方红”和“中国人民志愿军战歌”。而我国青年正在热烈地学习中国的通俗舞蹈“秧歌”。
    捷中两国之间的文化关系正在迅速地发展。我们在这里签订的文化协定将是捷中文化关系的巩固基础，将有助于捷中文化关系进一步有计划的和更丰富的发展。
    我们相信：捷中两国在文化生活的各方面的关系，诸如文学、艺术、戏剧、音乐、电影、广播、唱片事业，出版等方面，将非常顺利地发展起来。中国数千年文化的无穷宝藏和胜利的人民中国在新的创作方面的伟大成就，将有助于丰富捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的文化生活；这一点我们是非常重视的。
    我们也非常重视其余三个协定的伟大意义，我们相信：捷中科学与技术合作协定将成为捷中两国在发展科学技术各方面紧密合作和互助的关键，将有助于加速发展我们两国的生产力，有效地巩固世界和平阵营，从而维护世界和平。我们相信：现在签订的邮政与电信两协定，对于增进我们两国之间的友谊有很大的帮助。并将有效地为全面加强民主与社会主义世界广大地区内各族人民之间的联系而服务。
    最后，我想代表捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团再说几句话。捷克斯洛伐克政府授权我们在北京签订四个具有重大意义的捷中协定，是我们无上的光荣。因此，我们认为我们必须更忠诚地为加强捷中两国的友谊而工作。这种友谊是和我们对伟大的苏联和斯大林同志的热爱分不开的。我们感谢斯大林同志，他使捷中两国的劳动人民今天能够建设美好的新生活；他使捷中两国，虽然相距数万里，仍能亲密地合作携起手来，使我们能够向幸福的社会主义前途迈进。
    我预祝这四个协定签字后将获得完全的成功，并且高呼：
    捷中两国的友谊巩固起来！
    中华人民共和国和人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克共和国万岁！
    我们两国敬爱的领袖：中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志和捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统哥特瓦尔德同志万岁！
    我们两国共同的同盟者——伟大的苏联万岁！
    我们两国人民最好的朋友，进步人类的天才领袖，全世界为和平而斗争的先进旗手——伟大的斯大林万岁！
