    After the "Three-Anti" Campaign,
    The Life of Workers in a Mechanical Factory in Shenyang Has Greatly Improved
    Comrade Editor: The life of workers in a mechanical factory in Shenyang has greatly improved after the "Three-Anti" campaign. In the past, when female workers in the factory had children, they had to temporarily stop working and stay at home to take care of the children because breastfeeding interfered with work. Now, the factory has established a nursery, with three nannies taking care of nineteen little babies. The nannies take care of the children very thoughtfully. These female workers quickly returned to their jobs and worked even harder. For the health of the workers, the factory also newly established a health and welfare canteen. In the past, when workers received health allowances, they would spend them extravagantly, and they would be gone in two or three times. Many workers brought lunch boxes and ate in the workshop, which was very unhygienic. In the wire drawing workshop, there was a lot of lime dust and blistered soil, and the workers squatted on the ground to eat, so these dirty things fell into the lunch boxes. Now that there is a canteen, the situation has completely changed. The canteen environment is very hygienic, all the furniture and utensils are particularly clean, and the dishes and rice are also cheap. Everyone only needs to spend more than one thousand yuan per meal. More than 80% of the workers in the factory eat in the canteen, and everyone is very satisfied. Worker Lao Tian said: "I have lived for more than fifty years and worked in the factory for more than twenty years. I have never had such a good life! This is all thanks to the achievements of the 'Three-Anti' campaign led by Chairman Mao!"

    三反”运动以后
    沈阳某机械厂职工的生活大大改善了
    编辑同志：沈阳某机械厂职工的生活，在“三反”运动后大大改善了。过去，厂里的女工生了小孩，因哺乳妨碍工作，只好暂时停工在家看小孩。现在，厂里成立了托儿所，由三个褓姆看护着十九个小娃娃，褓姆照顾孩子很周到。这些女工很快地回到工作岗位，干活也起劲了。厂里为了职工的健康，还新设了保健福利食堂。过去，职工拿到保健津贴，大吃大喝，两三次就光了。很多工人带饭盒在工作间吃饭，很不卫生。伸线工段的屋子里石灰面子和泡土很多，工人蹲在地上吃，这些脏物就落在饭盒里。现在有了食堂，情况就完全改变了。食堂的环境卫生挺好，一切家具、用具特别整洁，菜、饭卖的也便宜，每个人每顿花一千多元就够了。全厂百分之八十以上的职工都在食堂里吃饭了，大家都很满意。工友老田说：“我活了五十多岁，在厂里干了二十多年的活，那有过这样好的日子！这都是毛主席领导的‘三反’运动的成果啊！”
