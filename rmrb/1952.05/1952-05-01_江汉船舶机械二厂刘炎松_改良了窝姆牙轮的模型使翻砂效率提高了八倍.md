    Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Factory No. 2, Liu Yansong
    Improved the Worm Gear Model, Increasing Sand Casting Efficiency Eightfold
    Editor: Liu Yansong, a model worker at the Hanyang Jianghan Shipbuilding Machinery Factory No. 2, successfully improved the model for the worm gear on the floodgate winch. During the Jingjiang flood diversion project, Liu Yansong was responsible for making the worm gear models. At that time, a total of fifty-five such gears were needed. He thought, "The task is very urgent. If we can't complete it on time, when the floodwaters rise, the lives and property of millions of people in the Jingjiang area will be flooded." He racked his brains and resolved to make the model both up to standard and economical in terms of labor and materials. He discussed with his team members and actively sought the assistance of technical personnel. After repeated experiments, he succeeded. This improved model increased sand casting efficiency eightfold. Using it to cast fifty-five gears saved five hundred foundry workers; the gears produced did not require processing, which also saved five hundred fitters. His successful experience has been extended to other factories that are also undertaking this task. Liu Yansong said, "The main reason I was able to improve the model was because the Party's education improved my awareness. I have some experience, and the technical personnel have theory. When the two are combined, many problems can be solved. I deeply know that only in this way can our production be improved and our technology can be advanced faster!"

    改良了窝姆牙轮的模型  使翻砂效率提高了八倍
    编辑同志：汉阳江汉船舶机械二厂模型工人刘炎松，改良洪闸绞车上窝姆牙轮的模型成功了。在荆江分洪工程中，刘炎松负责做窝姆牙轮的模型。当时共需这种牙轮五十五个。他想：“任务很紧张，要是不能如期完成，到时候大水一涨，荆江地区千万人的生命财产都要被水淹没了。”他开动脑筋，决心要把模型做得既合标准，又省工省料。他和小组同志商讨，并主动争取技术人员的协助。经过一再试验，他做成功了。这种改良的模型使翻砂效率提高八倍。用它来翻五十五个牙轮，可省五百个翻砂工；翻出的牙轮不用加工，又可省五百个钳工。他这一成功的经验，已被推广到同时承做该项任务的其他厂里去了。刘炎松说：“我所以能改良模型，主要是因为党的教育提高了我的觉悟。我有点经验，技术人员有理论，二者一结合，就解决了很多问题。我深深知道，只有这样，我们的生产才能搞得更好，我们在技术上才能进步得更快！”
