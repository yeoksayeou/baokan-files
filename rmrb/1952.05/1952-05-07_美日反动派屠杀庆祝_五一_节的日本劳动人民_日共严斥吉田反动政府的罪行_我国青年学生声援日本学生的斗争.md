Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Tokyo News: The Japanese people are severely denouncing the American and Japanese reactionaries for barbarically suppressing the Japanese laboring people celebrating "May Day," creating a bloody massacre. The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement after the massacre, saying: The Yoshida government should bear full responsibility for the tragedy. Because the Yoshida government illegally prohibited the masses celebrating "May Day" from using the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace and ordered the police to attack the marchers at the entrance of the plaza, brutally harming them, it caused the bloody tragedy. On the 3rd, the JCP's newspaper "Akahata" demanded that Yoshida and his cabinet immediately resign and demanded that the Tokyo Police Chief Eiichi Tanaka be removed from his post and that the murderers who attacked the masses in the "May Day" massacre be handed over to the people's court for trial. "Akahata" also called on Japanese workers to hold a general strike to overthrow the Yoshida government. The newspaper also revealed that it was an American military policeman who first fired a gun in the massacre.

The left and right wings of the Socialist Party also unanimously believe that the Yoshida government should be held responsible for the massacre. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the left wing of the Socialist Party, issued a statement on the 3rd, condemning the Yoshida government's tendency towards fascism and using high-pressure tactics to suppress mass demonstrations. He pointed out that from the Yoshida government's actions, it can be seen that it has become a foreign agent. Suzuki also demanded the resignation of the Yoshida cabinet.

According to further investigation, in the "May Day" massacre, in Tokyo alone, five to six hundred innocent people were injured or killed. In Kyoto, about two hundred people were injured by the police.

At the same time, the American and Japanese reactionaries not only have no remorse for the "May Day" massacre, but are also stepping up their plans to suppress the people. According to Kyodo News, the Yoshida cabinet meeting on the 2nd discussed "countermeasures for maintaining public order," "intending to further strengthen suppression" and "conduct searches and arrests." On the same day, Education Minister Teiyu Amano publicly stated that he would convene a meeting of university presidents across the country to "discuss measures to prevent students from participating in political movements." Arrests are continuing in various places. By late night on the 2nd, the Tokyo police had arrested 166 people; according to the National Police Agency, it had arrested 248 people across the country. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 3rd, the authorities are expected to "conduct large-scale arrests." These despicable atrocities by the American and Japanese reactionaries show how panicked and uneasy they are in the face of the growing power of the Japanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Students' Federation, and all students of Renmin University of China, Peking University, and Tsinghua University sent telegrams to Japanese students on April 29, supporting their struggle against the entry into effect of the separate peace treaty with Japan.

The telegram from the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth said: "Chinese youth are concerned about your strike struggle against the implementation of the U.S. imperialist unilateral peace treaty with Japan. We believe that no matter how the U.S. imperialists and the Yoshida government suppress and deceive you, Japanese students will overcome all kinds of difficulties, resolutely unite with the entire Japanese people, and fight to the end for national independence, democratic peace, and against the American occupiers and the traitorous Yoshida government." The telegram from the All-China Students' Federation pointed out: Your struggle has won the full support of all peace-loving people; and said: "We Chinese students are closely integrated with the workers and peasants, and after a long and arduous struggle for the liberation of the nation and the people, we finally achieved victory. We believe that Japanese students who love the motherland, cherish peace, and pursue truth will be able to unite closely with the Japanese laboring people and wage a resolute struggle for the independence of the motherland and the freedom of the people, and achieve the same victory." The telegrams from the students of the three universities also unanimously expressed their firm support for the heroic struggle of the Japanese students and wished them final victory.

    美日反动派屠杀庆祝“五一”节的日本劳动人民
    日共严斥吉田反动政府的罪行
    我国青年学生声援日本学生的斗争
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：日本人民严厉斥责美、日反动派野蛮地镇压庆祝“五一”节的日本劳动人民，制造血腥的大惨案。日本共产党在惨案发生之后发表声明说：吉田政府应对惨案负完全责任。由于吉田政府非法禁止庆祝“五一”节的群众使用皇宫前广场，并且命令警察在广场的入口处袭击游行的人，对他们横加残害，因此造成了流血惨案。三日，日共机关报“赤旗报”要求吉田及其内阁立即引咎辞职，并要求把东京警察总监田中荣一撤职，把“五一”惨案中对群众行凶的凶手交由人民法庭审判。“赤旗报”并号召日本工人举行总罢工，打倒吉田政府。该报并揭露，在惨案中首先放枪的是一个美国宪兵。
    社会党左派和右派也一致认为吉田政府应对惨案负责。社会党左派主席铃木茂三郎三日发表谈话，谴责吉田政府趋向法西斯化，以高压手段镇压群众的示威游行。他指出：从吉田政府这种行动可以看出，它本身已成为外国的代理人。铃木也要求吉田内阁辞职。
    根据进一步的调查，在“五一”惨案中，仅在东京一地就有无辜群众五六百人伤亡。在京都约有二百人被警察打伤。
    同时，美、日反动派对“五一”惨案不但没有悔祸之心，而且正加紧筹划对人民进行镇压。据共同社透露，二日的吉田内阁会议讨论了“治安对策”，“拟进一步加强镇压”，“进行搜查和逮捕”。同日，文相天野贞祐公开声明他将召集全国各大学校长举行会议，“讨论防止学生参加政治运动的措施”。逮捕正在各地继续进行中。东京警察到二日深夜为止，已经逮捕了一百六十六人；另据国家警察方面宣布，它已在全国各地逮捕了二百四十八人。据美联社东京三日电透露，预料当局还要“进行大规模的逮捕”。美、日反动派的这类卑鄙的暴行，正说明它们在日益壮大的日本人民力量的面前是如何的恐慌和不安。
    【新华社二日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会，中华全国学生联合会以及中国人民大学、北京大学和清华大学的全体学生，在四月二十九日分别致电日本学生，支持他们的反对单独对日和约生效的斗争。
    中华全国民主青年联合总会的电报说：“中国青年关怀你们为反对美帝国主义片面对日和约生效而进行的罢课斗争。我们相信，不管美帝国主义与吉田政府如何镇压与欺骗，日本学生一定会克服各种困难，坚决和全日本人民团结一致，为民族独立与民主和平、反对美国占领者和卖国的吉田政府而斗争到底。”中华全国学生联合会的电报指出：你们的斗争获得了一切爱好和平的人民的全力支持；又说：“我们中国学生与工农群众亲密结合，为求民族与人民的解放，进行了长期艰苦的斗争，终于获得了胜利。我们相信，热爱祖国、酷爱和平与真理的日本学生，一定能为祖国的独立与人民的自由和日本劳动人民亲密团结而进行坚决的斗争，并取得同样的胜利。”三个大学学生的电报，也一致表示坚决支援日本学生的英勇斗争，并祝他们取得最后的胜利。
