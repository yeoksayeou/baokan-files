Spokespersons of China's Democratic Parties Issue Statements
Protesting Provocative Actions by the British Government in Hong Kong

[Report from this newspaper] Spokespersons of China's democratic parties have issued statements, protesting the recent intensification of persecution against patriotic compatriots by the British government in Hong Kong, and the brutal act of illegally ordering the suspension of the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao.

The spokesperson of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said: The past series of provocative acts by the British government in Hong Kong against the Chinese people have aroused the anger and opposition of all Chinese people; but the British government turned a blind eye and showed no repentance, even intensifying these actions. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate such measures that disregard justice, and are brutal and shameless. We want to warn the British imperialists that they should immediately stop all atrocities against the Chinese people in Hong Kong. The colonial era of enslaving the Chinese people is over. We firmly support the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, and the British government should be fully responsible for all the consequences caused by all atrocities.

The spokesperson of the headquarters of the China Democratic League said: The China Democratic League lodges a serious protest against the crimes committed by the British government in Hong Kong, such as persecuting our patriotic compatriots and ordering the temporary suspension of the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao." The Chinese people are willing to establish normal relations of equality and friendship with the British people, but the British Churchill government has violated the wishes of the British people and has consistently pursued the aggressive policy of American imperialism, continuously persecuting our compatriots in Hong Kong. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We want to warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: The patriotic people and journalists of our country in Hong Kong have the great strength of all the Chinese people as their backing. If you do not immediately stop the provocative actions against the Chinese people, and do not cancel the illegal measures against "Ta Kung Pao" and other newspapers, then the British government should bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

The spokesperson of the China National Democratic Construction Association said: All these illegal, unreasonable, and tyrannical acts of the British government in Hong Kong show that it is willing to follow American imperialism, implement the American imperialist policy of aggression against our country, and disregard the consequences of its foolish and adventurous behavior. We want to solemnly warn the British government in Hong Kong: you must immediately stop all crimes. If you are still obsessed with your own ways and still want to treat the Chinese people with the eyes of the Opium War era, you will definitely be met with a bloody nose.

The spokesperson of the China Association for Promoting Democracy said: Under the instigation of American imperialism, the British government in Hong Kong is shamelessly depriving Chinese residents in Hong Kong of their freedom and rights, and disregarding the repeated protests of the Chinese people and government, intensifying the implementation of a policy hostile to our people, and continuing to provoke our people unreasonably in a planned way. This is intolerable to the Chinese people. We firmly support the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on May 10. We will fully support the struggle of the Chinese people in Hong Kong to win their legitimate rights and interests.

The spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party said: We once again lodge a serious protest with the British government against the British government's series of despicable acts in Hong Kong of trampling on the basic freedom and rights of Chinese residents and persecuting the Chinese people's journalism in Hong Kong. The British government in Hong Kong should immediately revoke the illegal judgment against the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," revoke the unreasonable accusations against the "Wen Wei Po" and "New Evening News," and immediately stop the persecution of our residents in Hong Kong.

The spokesperson of the China Zhi Gong Party said: The British authorities in Hong Kong, obeying the will of their American masters, are acting perversely, trampling on the basic rights of our residents living in Hong Kong, and at the same time have carried out various provocative acts against our People's Republic of China. Our people find this completely intolerable. We fully support the protest lodged by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British government, and we warn the British authorities in Hong Kong that they must immediately stop all their atrocities.

The spokesperson of the September 3rd Society said: We cannot sit idly by and watch such crazy and shameless atrocities of British imperialism. We want to condemn this atrocity in front of peace-loving people all over the world, and lodge a serious protest to British imperialism. We believe that this series of barbaric and shameless events created by the British government in Hong Kong is not an accidental local event, but a new development in the British government's policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China. This new development is the result of the British reactionary Churchill cabinet further wagging its tail to the American government and obeying the American government's policy of aggressive war. We want to warn the British government that your attempt is not only absolutely impossible to succeed, but also a completely reckless and foolish adventure. The British government in Hong Kong must immediately revoke the illegal judgment against our people's newspaper, Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," immediately stop the unreasonable persecution of our residents, and must abandon the policy of hostility towards our people. If you still persist in your errors and continue to act arbitrarily, in order to protect the legitimate rights of our residents in Hong Kong, and to defend the security of the motherland and peace in the Far East, we must resolutely fight to the end!

The spokesperson of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's Beijing Office said: Recently, the Hong Kong authorities, disregarding the protests of our government and people, have intensified their actions and ordered the "Ta Kung Pao," operated by our people in Hong Kong, to suspend publication for six months, and sentenced the person in charge and editors of the newspaper to imprisonment. The news has arrived, making people extremely indignant! We demand that the British government immediately stop this illegal act of the Hong Kong authorities that is hostile to the Chinese people. If the Hong Kong authorities do not immediately abandon this barbaric measure, the British government will be fully responsible for the serious consequences.

    我国各民主党派发言人发表声明
    抗议香港英国政府的挑衅行为
    【本报讯】我国各民主党派发言人分别发表声明。抗议香港英国政府最近变本加厉迫害我爱国同胞，并非法勒令香港大公报停刊的暴行。
    中国国民党革命委员会发言人说：香港英国政府过去一连串的对于我国人民的挑衅行为，曾引起了全中国人民的愤怒和反对；但英国政府却熟视无睹，毫不悔改，甚至变本加厉。像这一切不顾公理、残暴无耻的措施，中国人民是绝对不能容忍的。我们要警告英帝国主义者，应即在香港停止对于中国人民的一切暴行。奴役中国人民的殖民时代已经过去了。我们坚决拥护中央人民政府外交部的声明，一切暴行所造成的后果，完全应由英国政府负责。
    中国民主同盟总部发言人说：对于香港英国政府迫害我爱国同胞和勒令香港“大公报”暂时停刊等罪行，中国民主同盟提出严重的抗议。中国人民是愿意与英国人民建立平等友好的正常关系的，但英国邱吉尔政府竟违背英国人民的愿望，始终追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，接连不断地在香港迫害我国同胞。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。我们要警告香港英国当局：香港的我国爱国人民及新闻工作者，是有全体中国人民的伟大力量作后盾的，如果你们不立即停止对中国人民的挑衅行为，不取消对“大公报”等报纸的非法措施，那么因此所引起的一切后果，英国政府应负全部的责任。
    民主建国会发言人说：香港英国政府的这一切非法的无理的横暴行为，说明它甘心追随美帝国主义之后，执行美帝国主义侵略我国的政策，而毫不计及它这种愚蠢和冒险行为的后果。我们要郑重警告香港英国政府：你们必须立即停止一切的罪行，假如执迷不悟，还想拿鸦片战争时代的眼光来对待中国人民，就一定要碰得头破血流。
    中国民主促进会发言人说：香港英国政府在美帝国主义唆使下，正恬不知耻地剥夺香港中国居民的自由和权利，不顾中国人民和政府的一再抗议而变本加厉地推行敌视我国人民的政策，继续有计划地向我国人民无理挑衅，这是中国人民决不能容忍的。我们坚决拥护我中央人民政府外交部五月十日的声明。我们将全力支持在香港的中国人民争取正当权益的斗争。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会发言人说：我们对于英国政府在香港一连串蹂躏中国居民的基本自由和权利、迫害香港中国人民新闻事业的卑劣行为，再一次向英国政府提出严重抗议。香港英国政府应立即撤销对于香港“大公报”的非法判决，撤销对“文汇报”“新晚报”两报的无理控告，立即停止对香港我国居民的迫害。
    中国致公党发言人说：香港英国当局顺从其美国主子的意思，倒行逆施，蹂躏住在香港的我国居民的基本权利，同时对我中华人民共和国进行了种种的挑衅行为，我国人民对此万难容忍。我们完全拥护我外交部对英国政府提出的抗议，并正告香港英当局必须立即停止其所有暴行。
    九三学社发言人说：我们对于英帝国主义这种疯狂无耻的暴行决不能坐视，我们要在全世界爱好和平的人民面前谴责这种暴行，并向英帝国主义提出严重的抗议。我们认为英国政府在香港造成的这一系列横蛮无耻的事件，决不是偶然发生的地方性事件，而是英国政府敌视中华人民共和国的政策新的发展，这个新的发展是英国反动的邱吉尔内阁进一步的向美国政府摇尾乞怜，顺从美国政府的侵略战争政策的结果。我们要正告英国政府，你们这种企图不惟是绝对不可能成功，并且是完全不计后果的愚蠢的冒险行为。香港英国政府必须立刻撤销对我国人民报纸香港“大公报”的非法判决，立刻停止对我国居民的无理迫害，必须放弃敌视我国人民的政策。如果你们仍然执迷不悟，继续一意孤行，为了保障香港我国居民的正当权利，为了保卫祖国的安全和远东的和平，我们就一定要坚决斗争到底！
    台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处发言人说：最近香港当局竟不顾我国政府、人民的抗议，更变本加厉地对我国人民在香港经营的大公报勒令停刊六个月，并对该报负责人和编辑判处徒刑，消息传来，令人万分愤慨！我们要求英国政府立即制止香港当局这种与中国人民为敌的非法行为。如果香港当局不立即放弃这种野蛮措施，其严重后果将由英国政府负完全责任。
