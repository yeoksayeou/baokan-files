Reader's Letter

    To the Editor: The Xuchang area of Henan Province is a nationally famous tobacco-producing region. Last year, due to pest damage, the quality of approximately 40% of the total tobacco yield was reduced. This batch of tobacco leaves could not be graded at all and had no market. The inability to sell this tobacco is detrimental to future tobacco production. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments, in accordance with the spirit of this year's National Native Produce Exchange Conference, find a way to solve this problem. Early tobacco has already been sown. Late tobacco (wheat stubble tobacco) will also be sown in about half a month. In order to ensure the quality of tobacco this year, I hope that relevant departments will earnestly provide tobacco farmers with guidance on tobacco planting techniques.

    应该解决许昌一带“等外烟”的销路问题
    编辑同志：河南许昌一带是全国著名的产烟区。去年该地因遭受虫害而降低品质的烟叶，约占总产量的百分之四十，这些烟叶根本验不上等级，也没有销路。这批烟叶不能销售，对今后烟叶的生产是不利的。为此，我建议有关部门根据今年全国土产交流会议的精神，设法解决这个问题。现在早烟已经播种了。晚烟（麦茬烟）在半个多月后也要播种。为了保证今年烟叶质量，我希望有关部门切实在种烟技术上予种烟农民以指导。
