    Special-Class Huai River Harnessing Model Jin Xiulan's Labor Team
    Creates a Good Method to Conquer Mud, Greatly Shortening the Time Required for the Project

    Editor Comrade: I feel particularly excited during the annual "May Day" Labor Day. Because I personally experienced that in the liberated New China, working people are the most glorious. Like me, the daughter of a peasant, I met the beloved leader Chairman Mao in Beijing last year, and also went abroad to participate in the World Youth and Student Festival. This can only be achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, when the working people are the masters of the country.

    Celebrating "May Day" Labor Day, I especially want to thank the older brother workers for their help in the farmers' Huai River harnessing. Before I went abroad last year, I visited the Runheji Diversion Sluice Project. There I saw workers helping farmers to complete this great project, working day and night, selflessly fighting the floods. This year, the older brother workers came from thousands of miles away to the Huai River to build the Fozi Ridge Reservoir. This great project will bring infinite happiness to the farmers in the northern Anhui region. On behalf of my team, I express my determination to learn from the older brother workers' spirit of serving the people selflessly, resolutely complete the spring Huai River harnessing task; and to continuously improve operating methods to continuously improve work efficiency.

    Our construction site is in Laolongtan. On this 650-meter-long section of the project, the ground is all five meters deep of thin silt. People standing on it will sink, and it is impossible to transport soil. But the working people of New China have a way to overcome all difficulties. We put forward the slogan:

    "Learn from the Volunteers, Resolutely Overcome the Mud". During the day, we used various methods to experiment with overcoming the mud, and held meetings at night to summarize experience. We once used wooden sticks as springboards, and then used reed bundles to lay on top for experiments, but these methods all failed. We became stronger as we fought, because the leading comrades constantly encouraged us, and all the workers digging the mud were looking forward to our success. After many efforts, we finally succeeded in the experiment. The method is to tie three reed bundles into a springboard and pave them into two roads, so that you can boldly carry the soil and walk on the mud. Now our soil carrying efficiency is constantly improving, from 0.5 to 0.8 and 1 cubic meter. This creation has shortened the project that we originally planned to complete with 1.17 million workdays to only 467,000 workdays. In the Huai River harnessing project, this kind of invention is very common. Other work teams are doing even more. We have launched competitions and challenges with each other. In order to learn from the advanced working methods of other work teams, we are continuing to research and improve. Our technical research team is summarizing the working methods of our team in order to further improve.

    Workers, peasants, and all working people, unite and let us work hard to build our beloved motherland.

    特等治淮模范金秀兰民工分队
    创造了战胜稀泥的好办法使工程所需时间大大缩短
    编辑同志：在一年一度的“五一”劳动节，我感到特别兴奋。因为我自己亲身体验到，在解放了的新中国，劳动人民是最光荣的。像我这样一个农民的女儿，去年到北京见了敬爱的领袖毛主席，而且出国参加了世界青年、学生联欢节大会。这只有在共产党和工人阶级的领导下，劳动人民做了国家的主人，才能办得到。
    庆祝“五一”劳动节，我特别要感谢工人老大哥对农民治淮的帮助。去年我出国前参观了润河集分水闸工程，在那里我看见工人帮助农民为完成这个伟大的工程，不分昼夜地工作，忘我地与洪水作斗争。今年工人老大哥又从千里以外来到淮河建筑佛子岭水库。这一伟大工程将给皖北区农民带来无限幸福。我代表我分队民工表示：决心向工人老大哥学习大公无私为人民服务的精神，坚决完成春季治淮任务；并要不断改进操作方法，使工作效率继续提高。
    我们的工地在老龙潭。在这段长达六百五十公尺的工程地面上，都是深及五公尺的稀淤泥，人站在上面会陷下去，根本不能运土抬土。但新中国的劳动人民是有办法克服一切困难的，我们提出口号：
    “学习志愿军，坚决干倒稀泥”。我们白天用各种办法来试验战胜稀泥，晚上开会总结经验。我们曾经用木棒来做跳板，又用苇把子铺在上边试验，但这些办法都失败了。我们越战越强，因为领导同志不断鼓励我们，所有挖稀泥的民工也都盼望着我们成功。我们经过多次的努力，终于试验成功了。办法是用三个苇把子扎一个跳板，铺成两条路，这样就可以大胆地抬着土走在稀泥上面。现在我们的抬土效率不断提高，已由○·五提高到○·八和一方了。这一创造使我们原计划需要一百一十七万个工作日完成的工程，缩短到只要四十六万七千个工作日。在治淮工程中，这种创造发明是很普通的事情。别的工作队作得更要多些。我们彼此之间都展开了竞赛挑战。为了学习别的工作队的先进工作法，我们还在继续研究改进。我们的技术研究小组正在总结我们分队的工作法，以便更加提高。
    工人、农民和所有的劳动人民团结起来，让我们努力建设我们可爱的祖国吧。
    皖北特等治淮模范  金秀兰
