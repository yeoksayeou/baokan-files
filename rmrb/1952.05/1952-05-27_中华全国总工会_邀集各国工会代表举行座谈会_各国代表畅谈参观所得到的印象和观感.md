Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) convened a farewell symposium on the afternoon of the 26th for trade union representatives and observers from various countries who came to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations. The symposium was presided over by Liu Ningyi, Vice-Chairman of the ACFTU.

After attending the "May Day" celebrations in Beijing, representatives from various countries visited Northeast and East China to observe China's construction in various fields. They shared their impressions and observations gained in China at the symposium.

Indian trade union representative Mitra said that his overall impression of China was that the new Chinese people are building a new society with boundless enthusiasm. He spoke of China's achievements in land reform, agricultural production, and industrial construction, as well as the rising living standards of the working class, the improvement of women's status, and the increase in children's welfare. Mitra pointed out that the Chinese people demonstrate their love of peace not only in words but also in actions. The Chinese people need peace, therefore, the best response we can give to the Chinese people is to strive to defend peace.

The head of the Australian trade union delegation, Wright, praised the achievements of new China in various fields. He said: Although the Chinese people have won victory after many difficult years filled with war and destruction for less than three years, production has generally recovered and is now rapidly moving towards industrialization. He continued: In Beijing, we visited the exhibition of evidence of the United States' germ warfare in Korea and China. Our delegation condemns this inhumane means of warfare and will do its utmost to awaken the Australian people to oppose the criminals who conduct this war.

The Iranian representative said: The Chinese people have achieved the broadest democratic unity. They are all educated in patriotism and internationalism, and they all love justice and peace. The progress we have seen in China in all aspects far exceeds our imagination. After returning home, we are willing to do our best to help the Iranian people understand new China. We will use various means such as writing articles, giving speeches, and compiling books to let them recognize the miracles completed by the Chinese people.

The head of the Danish "May Day" observation delegation, Abel, said that he gained many profound impressions during his visits in China. He mentioned that one of the things that moved him the most was the huge project of the Huai River Sluice. He said that the Bible once talked about people wanting to build a tower to reach heaven, but the working people of China are using their blood and sweat to build heaven on earth, not only for the Chinese people but also for the people of the world.

The head of the Burmese trade union delegation, Thein Pe Myint, said: The Chinese working people enjoy the fruits of their own labor. Their labor is not for war, but for peace. All the efforts of the Chinese people are for the cause of peace. He said: This visit has convinced us that the Chinese people armed with Marxism-Leninism are invincible.

Sri Lankan trade union representative Saravanamuttu said: Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people have achieved great achievements. He said that the colonial people are watching new China and taking it as a model.

The head of the Swedish trade union delegation, Sennander, said: In China, whether in rural areas, factories, schools or other places, we see everywhere the Chinese people's trust and love for their wise leader Chairman Mao and the People's Government; everywhere we are convinced that the Chinese people are building peace. We believe that the Chinese people will always defend peace and freedom. The imperialists' aggressive plans will never succeed.

The head of the Soviet trade union delegation, Shevchenko, praised the great achievements of the Chinese people in defending peace and building their motherland in his speech. He said that the Chinese people's high labor enthusiasm and firm will to defend peace, as well as their deep friendship with the Soviet Union, deeply moved the Soviet delegation.

The head of the Indonesian trade union delegation, Suroso, said: The Chinese people have a high degree of optimism and love for humanity, which means love for world peace. The Chinese people have a sense of responsibility as masters of the country and are proactive and organized in their work, which strengthens our confidence in the people's democratic system. He concluded: We believe that we have a responsibility to tell our people after we return home that the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people, and the people of the world, is solid.

The head of the Romanian trade union delegation, Elina, thanked the Chinese people for their warm reception of the delegates in her speech. She said that this hospitality proves that the Chinese working people have received a high degree of patriotic and internationalist education, and proves their love for the working people of the world. She spoke of China's newly built factories, schools, nurseries, sanatoriums, and the Huai River harnessing project. She said: The achievements of the Chinese people have inspired the working people of the world. Finally, she, on behalf of the Romanian trade union delegation, congratulated the Chinese people on achieving more achievements in their great construction cause.

The head of the German Democratic Republic trade union delegation, Hellbich, said: The Chinese people's boundless love for their motherland and boundless confidence in the future are evident everywhere in factories, schools, and rural areas. We have seen the invincible strength of the Chinese people, and we are proud to have China as such a friend. The German people, like the Chinese people, are waging a resolute struggle against US imperialism for peace and unity. We must drive the aggressive forces of US imperialism out of Germany.

Finally, Liu Ningyi delivered a speech, thanking the representatives of various countries for their concern and encouragement for the Chinese people. He said that the unity of the working people of the world is constantly strengthening, and we will surely win a future of peace and happiness.

At the meeting, Chakravarthy, the Indian trade union representative, presented a banner to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on behalf of the All-India United Trade Union Congress.
