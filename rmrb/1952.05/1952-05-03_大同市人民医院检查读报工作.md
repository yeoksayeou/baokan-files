    Dalian City People's Hospital Inspects Newspaper Reading Work
    Editor: The "Reader's Letter" column of the People's Daily has continuously criticized the phenomenon of some staff members of organs neglecting newspaper reading, and called on organs and groups in various places to check the newspaper reading situation in their units. This matter has aroused our attention. Our Dalian City People's Hospital recently conducted an inspection of the newspaper reading and learning of its staff, and organized group discussions, and the learning committee studied and formulated measures to strengthen newspaper reading.
    After inspection, we found that the phenomenon of our hospital staff neglecting newspaper reading is very serious. Among the more than fifty people with reading ability, half of them do not have the habit of reading newspapers. Although the rest often read newspapers, the effect is very poor. Individual nurses regard reading newspapers as a tool for "killing time." Some of them excuse themselves by saying they are too busy to read newspapers. Some also emphasize the importance of professional work and neglect politics. They say, "I am a technical worker, and newspapers have nothing to do with me." Obviously, these are purely technical viewpoints. They mistakenly place newspaper reading and professional work in opposition to each other. The reason why this phenomenon has not been corrected in time is that the hospital leadership has not paid enough attention to the political and current affairs learning of the staff, and has not seriously organized everyone to study newspapers. In the past, we subscribed to thirteen copies of newspapers, but due to improper distribution and no one responsible for receiving, sending, and keeping them, newspapers were often lost; some people wanted to read newspapers but couldn't find them. More importantly, we lacked the organization and system for newspaper reading and learning. That is to say, there was a lack of leadership for newspaper reading and learning.
    Now, we have formulated measures to strengthen newspaper reading: (1) Universally establish newspaper reading groups, with collective newspaper reading twice a week (a total of four hours), with a designated person responsible for reading and explaining, and discussions on important issues; (2) Increase the number of newspapers subscribed to, redistribute them as needed, and assign a designated person to be responsible for safekeeping; (3) Regularly hold current affairs quizzes to promote everyone's newspaper reading and learning. These measures have already begun to be implemented; but how to continue to strengthen newspaper reading and learning, and thoroughly overcome the tendency to neglect politics, still requires further strengthening the ideological education of cadres and the political leadership of the organs.

### 大同市人民医院检查读报工作

    大同市人民医院检查读报工作
    编辑同志：人民日报“读者来信”栏连续地对某些机关工作人员忽视读报的现象提出批评，并且号召各地机关、团体检查本单位的读报情况。这件事引起了我们的重视。我们大同市立人民医院最近对工作人员的读报学习作了一次检查，并且分组展开讨论，由学习委员会研究订出加强读报的办法。
    经过检查，我们发现我院职工忽视读报的现象是很严重的。在五十多个有阅读能力的人当中，有一半的人没有看报的习惯。其余的人虽然经常看报，但是效果很差。个别护士把看报纸当成是“解闷”的工具。他们有些人藉口工作忙不看报。也有些人强调业务重要，而忽视政治。他们说：“我是技术工作者，报纸与我无关。”显然，这些都是单纯技术观点。他们错误地把学习报纸和业务工作对立起来了。这种现象没有及时得到纠正的原因，是医院领导方面对工作人员的政治和时事学习不够重视，没有认真组织大家学习报纸。过去，我们订了十三份报纸，但是由于分配不恰当，收发和保管无专人负责，报纸经常丢失；有些人想看报却找不到报纸。更重要的是，我们缺乏读报学习的组织和制度。也就是说，缺少对读报学习的领导。
    现在，我们已订出加强学习报纸的办法：（一）普遍建立读报组，每星期集体读报两次（共四小时），由专人负责讲读，对于重要问题并展开讨论；（二）增加报纸份数，按需要重新分配，专人负责保管；（三）经常举行时事测验，以推动大家的读报学习。这些办法都已开始实行；但是如何继续加强读报学习，彻底克服忽视政治的倾向，还需要继续加强干部的思想教育和机关的政治领导。
