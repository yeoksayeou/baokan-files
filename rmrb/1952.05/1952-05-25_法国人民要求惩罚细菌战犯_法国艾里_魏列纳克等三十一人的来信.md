Editor's Note: The following letter was sent by 31 French people, including Élie Weill (legal scholar), to Zhu Rongzhao, associate researcher at the Dalian Branch of the Northeast Institute of Science, for forwarding. The original translated letter and signatures are as follows:

Dear friends:

For more than a month, we in France have known about the abominable germ warfare conducted by the American aggressors in Korea and Northeast China. Like people all over the world, the French people have risen up in anger against this premeditated war crime. Many protests have been issued in our country. French doctors and jurists have participated in investigation teams to go to the area to collect irrefutable evidence of this crime against humanity by the American aggressors.

The signatories of this letter wish to express their anger (a word that is too weak when one thinks of the butchers who massacre the Korean people) and their solidarity with those brave people, full of the spirit of sacrifice, who are fighting for peace, happiness, and the right to autonomy.

We fully endorse the resolution of the recent Executive Bureau meeting of the World Peace Council held in Oslo, demanding the unconditional prohibition of bacteriological weapons and the punishment of the new war criminals.

Our common efforts, the efforts of the people of all countries, will defeat those mentally ill people who are trying to destroy the human race. We salute the brave Korean brothers and the Chinese People's Volunteers who stand at the forefront of this struggle. This struggle sometimes takes different forms, but its goal is one: the liberation, peace and happiness of mankind.

Élie Weill and 30 others (signatures)

    法国人民要求惩罚细菌战犯
    ——法国艾里·魏列纳克等三十一人的来信
    编者按：下面这封信，是法国艾里·魏列纳克（法律学者）等三十一人寄给我国东北科学研究所大连分所副研究员朱荣昭转寄来的。原信译文及签名如下：亲爱的朋友：
    我们在法国知道了美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国东北进行可憎恶的细菌战争，已经有一个多月了。和全世界人民一样，法国人民愤怒地起来了，反对这个带着预谋的战争罪行。在我国，已经发出了许许多多的抗议。曾有法国医生和法学家参加过调查团，前去当地，搜集美国侵略者这种危害人类的无可争辩的罪证。
    本信的签名者们愿表示他们的愤怒（当人们想起那些屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手时，这个字眼还用得太软弱了），和他们对于那些勇敢的，充满了牺牲精神的，为了和平、幸福与自主权利而斗争的人们的团结心。
    我们完全拥护最近在奥斯陆举行的世界和平理事会执行局会议的决议，要求无条件禁止细菌武器，并惩罚新的战争罪犯们。
    我们共同的努力，各国人民的努力，将要击退那些企图消灭人种的精神病患者们。我们向立在这个斗争最前线的勇敢的朝鲜兄弟们和中国人民志愿军致敬礼。这个斗争有时带着种种不同的形式，可是它的目的只有一个：人类的解放、和平与幸福。
    艾里·魏列纳克等三十一人（签名）
    法国、巴黎、辣斐德屋，一九五二年四月十三日
