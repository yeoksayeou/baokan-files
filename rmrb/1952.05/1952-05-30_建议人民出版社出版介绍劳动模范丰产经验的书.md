    Suggest People's Publishing House Publish Books Introducing Labor Model's High-Yield Experience
    Editor: I am a student at the Shijiazhuang Advanced Agricultural School in Hebei Province. In addition to learning from our teachers, we should also learn from agricultural labor models, because their high-yield experience is a very good teaching material for us. Labor models are determined to increase cotton production to 1,000 catties per mu, but our classmates and some teachers and experts lack confidence in this plan of the labor models. This shows that the advanced and creative experience of labor models can be used as our teaching material to break certain conservative views in our studies. Therefore, I suggest that the People's Publishing House compile and print a large number of books on the high-yield experience of national labor models for our technical school students to study, and also supply them to youth league members and propagandists in various places as learning and publicity materials.

    建议人民出版社出版介绍劳动模范丰产经验的书
    编辑同志：我是河北省石家庄高级农业学校的学生。我们除了应该向教师们学习外，同时也应该向农业劳动模范们学习，因为他们的丰产经验就是我们很好的教材。劳动模范有决心把棉花的产量提高到每亩一千斤，而我们的同学和某些教师、专家们，却对劳动模范这种计划缺乏信心。这说明劳动模范先进的创造性的经验，是可以用来作我们的教材，以打破我们学习中的某些保守观点的。因此，我建议人民出版社把全国劳动模范的丰产经验，大量编印成书，供给我们技术学校的学生们学习，同时供给各地青年团员、宣传员作为学习和宣传的资料。　李望涛
