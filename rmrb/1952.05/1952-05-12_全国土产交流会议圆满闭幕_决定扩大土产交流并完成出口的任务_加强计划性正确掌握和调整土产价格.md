    [Reported by this newspaper] The Ministry of Trade convened the National Native Produce Exchange Conference to address the current temporary and localized stagnation in native produce exchange and to further consolidate and expand upon the achievements of last year's large-scale native produce exchange. The conference, which began on April 25th, concluded on April 30th. Attending the conference were the managers of native produce companies from major regions, cooperative representatives, representatives from the Northwest Region Trade Department, and representatives from relevant central financial and economic departments and specialized companies, totaling 65 people.

    The conference began with reports from the managers of native produce companies from major administrative regions on the implementation of contracts and agreements from last year's native produce exchange, as well as current problems and requests in native produce exchange. The reports showed that last year's native produce exchange conferences and native produce exhibitions, using contract and agreement-based trade methods, played a significant role in organizing and promoting large-scale native produce exchange. According to incomplete statistics, over ten thousand contracts and agreements were signed through these conferences, with a total transaction value of 10 trillion RMB. However, there were some shortcomings in the implementation of these contracts and agreements, resulting in only about 70% completion of this total trade value. The main shortcoming was insufficient understanding of production and sales conditions, which led to significant blindness in the signing of certain contracts and agreements. For example, Pingyuan Province needs 600,000 catties of tung oil annually, but the Pingyuan Province Cooperative had already purchased 450,000 catties. The Pingyuan Province Native Produce Company then signed a trade contract with the Hunan Province Native Produce Company for 600,000 catties. Added to the 400,000 catties purchased by the Pingyuan Province Oil Company, this totaled 1.45 million catties, a number far exceeding Pingyuan Province's annual tung oil needs. Secondly, some state-owned trade organizations and cooperative organizations held purely profit-seeking viewpoints, hindering the implementation of contracts and agreements.

    The conference conducted a detailed study of the current temporary sales difficulties of lower-grade flue-cured tobacco and local tobacco, local sugar, live pigs, eggs, local cloth, Chinese gall, fennel, sulfur, and some medicinal materials, and proposed solutions: The China Native Produce Company will purchase a batch of lower-grade flue-cured tobacco and local tobacco, the China General Merchandise Company will purchase a batch of Zhejiang and Fujian sugar, the China Oils and Fats Company will increase its purchase of oilseeds, and the China Animal Husbandry Company will explore the export sales of pork. The sales difficulties of small-value native produce in various regions must be resolved locally through small-scale exchanges.

    The conference concluded with a summary by Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Trade. He pointed out the significant achievements of last year's national native produce exchange work, but also noted the lack of planning in last year's native produce exchange, with some contracts and agreements showing significant blindness. He criticized some state-owned trade organizations and cooperative trade organizations for their purely task-oriented viewpoints in purchasing and selling native produce, as well as their high-price thinking and purely profit-seeking viewpoints that did not implement the state's price policies.

    In light of last year's experience and the current situation, Yao Yilin proposed the principles and tasks for this year's native produce exchange: Based on last year's large-scale native produce exchange, consolidate and expand the achievements of domestic native produce exchange, while also fulfilling export tasks; strengthen planning, overcome blindness, accurately grasp and rationally adjust native produce prices, and develop steadily forward. Therefore, all regions should strengthen investigation and research on the production and sales of native produce. For native produce with promising prospects and good sales, development should be planned; for those with limited prospects but currently good sales, normal production should be maintained; for those with poor sales, producers should be persuaded to appropriately reduce production. For general native produce, emphasis should first be placed on short-distance sales, with sales within the province; for special products, long-distance sales can be organized. He also pointed out that the state's acquisition tasks for export native produce must be resolutely completed. He suggested that major administrative regions and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives should convene a native produce exchange conference, similar to those in Central South and North China, with the main focus on conducting transactions, first resolving the short-distance exchange problems between provinces and regions within the region, and inviting small delegations from other regions to participate in discussions and conclude inter-regional exchange contracts. The exchange of materials already controlled by state-owned trade enterprises and cooperatives should be prioritized. In the summary, he emphasized that all contracts and agreements concluded in the past must be reviewed with a serious and responsible attitude, and trade administrative departments at all levels have the responsibility to supervise and organize the implementation of contracts. In principle, all contracts and agreements, once concluded, must be implemented. The price policy for native produce, like other commodities, should adhere to the principle of benefiting production, transportation, and consumption; to promote the development of native produce, all state-owned trade organizations and cooperative trade organizations must adhere to the policy of small profits and quick turnover.

    Finally, Yao Yilin, on behalf of the Ministry of Trade, self-critically examined the bureaucratic errors in the native produce exchange work, especially being satisfied with the existing achievements of native produce exchange and failing to recognize early on that many chaotic phenomena would occur in planning, prices, and contractual relationships after certain native produce became best-selling; failing to promptly inspect and help local trade departments overcome capitalist ideas and practices in the operation of native produce; and failing to formulate common conditions for native produce contracts early on to avoid losses and confusion. He also requested that all regions, during the construction phase of the "Three-Anti" campaign, join the Ministry of Trade in further examining the erroneous viewpoints and practices in the operation of native produce, in order to improve future work.

    全国土产交流会议圆满闭幕
    决定扩大土产交流并完成出口的任务
    加强计划性正确掌握和调整土产价格
    【本报讯】为了打开当前土产交流中暂时的局部的呆滞现象，继续巩固和扩大去年的土产大交流的成绩，中央贸易部召开了全国土产交流会议。这个会议从四月二十五日开始，已于四月三十日闭幕。参加这次会议的有各大区土产公司经理、合作社代表和西北区贸易部代表，有中央有关的财经部门和专业公司代表共计六十五人。
    会议首由各大行政区土产公司经理等汇报了去年土产交流中合同和协议的执行情况，及当前土产交流中的问题和要求。从汇报中可以看出，去年各地的土产交流会议和土产展览会，通过合同协议的贸易方式，对于组织和推动土产的大交流起了重大作用。据不完全的统计，通过这些会议，共订合同和协议万余件，交易总值达人民币十万亿元。但在执行合同和协议中还有些缺点，致仅完成这一项贸易总值的百分之七十左右。主要缺点是对产销情况了解不足，因而使某些合同和协议的签订，带有很大的盲目性。例如：平原省年需桐油六十万斤，但平原省合作社已买了四十五万斤，平原省土产公司和湖南省土产公司又签订了六十万斤的贸易合同；再加上平原省油脂公司收购的四十万斤在内，共计一百四十五万斤。这个数字大大超过了平原省每年所需桐油的数量。其次，在某些国营贸易组织和合作社组织中，还有单纯营利观点，障碍着合同和协议的贯彻执行。
    对于当前等外烤烟和土烟、土糖、活猪、鸡蛋、土布、五棓子、小茴香、硫磺和部分药材等的暂时滞销问题，这次会议进行了详细研究，并提出了解决的办法：由中国土产公司收购一批等外烤烟和土烟，由中国百货公司收购一批浙糖和闽糖，由中国油脂公司增加一批油料的收购，由中国畜产公司开拓猪肉的外销。属于各地区的小额土产的滞销，须由地方从开展小范围的交流中解决。
    会议最后由中央贸易部副部长姚依林作总结。他指出了去年全国的土产交流工作的重大成绩，也指出了去年土产交流中计划性不足，有少数合同和协议带有很大的盲目性，批判了有些国营贸易组织和合作社贸易组织在购销土产上的单纯任务观点，和不执行国家价格政策的高价思想、单纯盈利观点。
    针对去年经验和目前情况，姚依林提出了今年土产交流的方针和任务：在去年土产大交流的基础上，巩固和扩大国内土产交流的成绩，同时要完成出口任务；加强计划性，克服盲目性，正确掌握和合理调整土产价格，稳步地向前发展。因此，所有的地区都应加强对土产产销情况的调查研究。对有前途有销路的土产，应有计划地发展；对前途不大，目前有销路的，应维持正常生产；对销路不畅的，应说服生产者适当减产。对一般土产，首先应强调短距离的推销，应在省内推销；对于特产，可组织长距离的远销。他并指出：必须坚决完成国家对出口土产的收购任务，他建议各大行政区和合作总社都像中南、华北一样召开一次以进行交易为主的土产交流会议，首先解决本区省和省间、地区和地区间的近距离的交流问题，并可邀请外区派小型代表团参加讨论和订立地区间的交流合同。首先应对各国营贸易企业和合作社已掌握的物资进行交流。在总结中，他着重指出：对过去所订立的一切合同和协议，必须以严肃负责的态度进行清理，各级贸易行政部门有责任监督和组织合同的实现。在原则上，一切合同和协议一经订立，就必须贯彻执行。对于土产的价格政策，和其他商品一样应当遵守生产、运输、消费三方有利的原则；为促进土产的发展，一切国营贸易组织和合作社贸易组织都必须坚持薄利多销的方针。
    最后，姚依林代表中央贸易部从领导上检查了在土产交流工作中的官僚主义错误，特别是满足于土产交流已有的成绩，没有及早地认识到某些土产变为畅销之后，在计划上，在价格上，在合同关系上会发生许多混乱现象；没有及时检查和帮助各地的贸易部门克服在土产经营上的资本主义思想和作法；没有及早规定土产合同的共同条件，避免损失和混乱。他并要求各地在“三反”的建设阶段，同中央贸易部在一起，共同进一步检查土产经营中的错误观点和作法，以改进今后的工作。
