    The Northeast Workers' Political University Growing in Difficulty
    Correspondent Group of Northeast Workers' Political University
    The Northeast Workers’ Political University in Shenyang was established in February 1949, shortly after the liberation of Northeast China, and officially opened on March 1. Its task was to train a large number of worker cadres to meet the needs of factory management and the establishment of trade union organizations; at the same time, it prepared cadres to advance southward with the army and take over factories and enterprises in various cities.
    The Northeast Workers' Political University was established and grew up in difficult circumstances. At the beginning of the school year, there was a great lack of equipment such as student dormitories, beds, and furniture. There were only five or six cadres, and the Dean of Education and the Director of Education were concurrently held positions. Teachers and learning team leaders were also concurrently held by students. Cadres and students slept on the floor, used windowsills as desks, and used corridors as meeting rooms. However, from top to bottom, they had infinite confidence in the educational cause of the working class and finally overcame numerous difficulties, gradually making the school more complete from its simple beginnings. Now, the school has more than one hundred cadres and more than fifty workers. There are sufficient classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls, as well as a library, recreation room, and sports field. All this shows the care and attention of our Party and the People's Government to the educational cause of the working class, and shows that with the development of national economic construction, cultural life is rising day by day.
    From the opening of the school on March 1, 1949, to April 10 this year, the school has held six terms and trained 7,664 students. The first term lasted two months, and more than 800 of the more than 1,000 students went south with the army. The second and third terms lasted six months, and the fourth term lasted four months. At the end of the fourth term, due to the war of aggression against Korea launched by American imperialism, a large number of students signed up to participate in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Since the fifth term (1951), in order to strengthen trade union work, a trade union chairman class was held, as well as six specialized classes in wages, production, culture and education, art, labor protection, and female workers. The study period was four months for the trade union chairman class, three and a half months for the art class, two and a half months for the culture and education class, and two months for the others. In order to meet the needs of economic construction in Northeast China, a construction class was held from February to April this year, training more than 840 fresh troops in the construction industry.
    Most of the students in each term are of worker origin. According to statistics in 1951, 63 percent were of worker origin, 27 percent were students, 5 percent were farmers, and 5 percent were others. The average length of service was seven and a half years. Worker students lived in extreme poverty during the rule of the puppet Manchuria and the Kuomintang, and there was no question of reading or writing. Generally speaking, their cultural level was very low. On the other hand, because they were of worker origin, they had excellent qualities. As soon as they entered the school, they were grateful from the bottom of their hearts to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for their care, cultivation, and education of the working class, and their learning enthusiasm was very full. Before entering school, they had some non-working-class thoughts, but once they accepted the education of Marxism-Leninism, their political consciousness was greatly improved.
    The curriculum includes policy and current affairs education in the first term to meet the needs of the time, while the curriculum in other terms is basically divided into two parts: theoretical courses and professional courses.
    In terms of theoretical courses, since the second term, historical materialism has been taught to carry out class education; at the same time, in view of some of the erroneous ideas of workers and their past living conditions shortly after liberation, their fatalistic ideas were first eliminated, the essence of capitalists' exploitation of workers was exposed, and the law that capitalism is bound to perish was pointed out, so that they could establish a communist outlook on life. And combined with the study of "Common Program", "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party", "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" and other documents, they can understand the actual situation in China and the specific steps to realize communism in China.
    From the fourth term to the present, historical materialism—the history of social development—is taught. Combined with the actual thinking of current trade union cadres, students are educated in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so that they can establish the proletarian stand and viewpoint.
    In terms of professional courses, professional learning is carried out on the basis of theoretical learning. In the second, third, and fourth terms, general lectures were given on various trade union tasks. Since the fifth term, in addition to the comprehensive lectures given in the trade union chairman class, other specialized classes have been conducted around the main courses. At the beginning of the professional courses, each class generally talked about the Trade Union Law, so that students could have a unified understanding of the nature and tasks of trade unions and trade union work. Then, the current policies and regulations related to various specialized businesses are studied. On this basis, typical reports are selected and discussed in groups to exchange experiences and put forward specific methods to improve their work. When the construction class was opened in the sixth term, a practical performance course of advanced work experience was added, using facts to show that conservatism and empiricism are undesirable, laying the foundation for organizing and educating the masses to learn advanced experience. Students reflected: "Whoever doesn't believe it can perform and see!" This is the richest course in the professional courses.
    Northeast Workers’ Political University uses patriotic conventions, blackboard newspapers, radio stations, and other forms to carry out regular propaganda and mobilization work, which has greatly promoted and guaranteed the students’ studies. The patriotic convention is established by the trade union group (ie, the study group). The content of the convention is centered on learning, combined with the shortcomings existing in the students, and the articles are concise, popular, and practical, generally around five articles. Each person formulates guarantee articles for practicing the convention based on their own situation, and checks the implementation of the convention at the ten-minute quick meeting after the regular course study every night. Each class has two blackboard newspapers, which are published twice a week, to criticize various erroneous ideas, introduce various typical experiences, and include illustrations, so that students with lower cultural levels can also understand the content of the text. The radio station broadcasts for half an hour every morning from after morning exercises to before breakfast. The content is to summarize learning experience, and sometimes students with better academic performance report their learning experience, using specific examples to correct some students’ incorrect ideas, stimulate everyone’s learning enthusiasm, and consolidate and improve existing academic achievements.
    Carrying out appropriate cultural, recreational and sports activities while studying intensively is also an important condition for guaranteeing the completion of learning tasks. At Northeast Workers' Political University, there are two hours of free time every afternoon, and Saturday nights are cultural and recreational activity times, where plays are performed, movies are shown, or dances are held. Classes with longer study times sometimes self-write, self-direct, and self-perform plays or operas. In the recreation room, there are table tennis, chess, playing cards, checkers, Go, and so on. On rest days or holidays, the recreation room is particularly lively and full of joy.
    In terms of sports activities, morning exercises and running are done after getting up in the morning. During free activity time in the afternoon, basketball, volleyball, soccer, and single bars are played, and sometimes labor is used to build the school. Every spring, trees and vegetables are planted to green the campus; weeds are removed in the summer; and sports grounds and yard roads are usually repaired, and artificial hills are built. In the spring of 1951 alone, more than 19,000 trees were planted. In 1952, the construction class worked more than 50,000 hours in two months. The students fully demonstrated the fine qualities and high labor enthusiasm of the working class in the labor construction of the school.
    In daily life, whether going to class, attending meetings, or eating, they leave in organized queues, maintaining strict order and demonstrating the discipline of the working class. Whether indoors, outdoors, in corridors, or in toilets, they are often cleaned and tidy; glass, doors, windows, tables, and chairs are often wiped; beds and bedding are kept clean. In terms of environmental hygiene, competitions are often held, and classes compare and learn from each other.
    In short, the activities of Northeast Workers' Political University in all aspects inside and outside the classroom give people a serious but lively impression. It carries out serious political education, ideological education, and cultural education in a very active atmosphere.
    In the short three years since its establishment, Northeast Workers' Political University has trained batches of excellent worker cadres for the motherland. They have played a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity on the economic construction front, and many people have become the backbone of industrial construction. For example, Song Zhenyuan, chairman of the trade union of the Shenyang Maibao Factory, a graduate of the third term, has been elected vice chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions due to his achievements in organizing production.

    在困难中成长起来的东北工人政治大学
    东北工人政治大学通讯组
    沈阳东北工人政治大学是在东北解放不久，即一九四九年二月间建立的，三月一日正式开学。它的任务是大量培养工人干部，供给工厂管理和建立工会组织的需要；同时准备干部，随军进关南下，接收各城市的工厂企业。
    东北工人政治大学是在艰苦的环境中建立和成长起来的。开学之初，学员的宿舍、睡床、家具等设备都很缺乏。干部只有五、六个人，教育长、教育处长等都是兼任的，教员、各学习队长也都由学员兼任。干部和学员都睡在地板上；用窗台作办公桌，把走廊当会议室。但是，他们自上至下，对于工人阶级的教育事业，都抱有无限的信心，终于克服了重重的困难，使学校由简陋而逐渐走向完善。现在，全校已有干部一百多人，工友五十多人。有了足用的教室、宿舍、饭厅，还有图书室、游艺室、运动场等。这些都说明了我们的党和人民政府对工人阶级教育事业的关心和重视，说明了随着国家经济建设的开展，文化生活在日趋上升。
    从一九四九年三月一日开学到今年四月十日的三年中，学校已举办了六期，训练了七千六百六十四名学员。第一期为时两月，在一千多名学员中，就有八百多名随军南下。第二、三期学习时间为六个月，第四期四个月。第四期毕业时，因美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，大批学员报名参加了抗美援朝工作。自第五期起（一九五一年），为加强工会工作，举办工会主席班一个班，举办工资、生产、文教、艺术、劳保、女工等六个专业班。学习期限，除工会主席班为四个月、艺术班三个半月、文教班两个半月外，其他均为两个月。为了适应东北经济建设的需要，在今年二月至四月间举办了建筑班，培养了八百四十多名建筑事业中的生力军。
    各期学员大部分是工人出身。据一九五一年统计，工人出身的占百分之六十三，学生百分之二十七，农民百分之五，其他百分之五。工龄平均七年半。工人学员过去在伪满、国民党统治时代，生活极其困苦，根本谈不上读书识字。一般地讲，他们的文化程度是很低的。另一方面，由于他们是工人出身，品质优良，一进学校就从内心里感激毛主席和共产党对工人阶级的关怀、培养和教育，他们的学习情绪非常饱满。在未入学前，他们虽有某些非工人阶级的思想，可是，当他们一旦接受了马克思列宁主义的教育以后，他们的政治觉悟就大大地提高了。
    学校的课程内容除第一期主要是进行政策、时事教育，以适应当时的需要外，其他各期课程，基本上分理论课和业务课两部分。
    在理论课方面，自第二期起都是讲授历史唯物论，进行阶级教育；同时针对解放不久的工人中的某些错误思想和过去的生活状况，首先肃清他们的宿命论思想，揭发了资本家对工人剥削的实质，指出资本主义必然灭亡的规律，使其建立共产主义的人生观。并结合学习“共同纲领”、“中国革命和中国共产党”、“论人民民主专政”等文件，使他们了解到中国的实际情况，和在中国实现共产主义的具体步骤。
    自第四期起到现在，讲授历史唯物论——社会发展史。结合当前工会干部的思想实际，向学员进行马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的教育，使他们树立无产阶级的立场、观点。
    在业务课方面，业务学习是在理论学习的基础上进行的。在二、三、四期对各项工会工作进行了一般的讲授。自第五期以后，除工会主席班作了全面的讲授以外，其他专业班都是围绕着主要的课程进行的。在业务课开始时，各班一般都讲了工会法，使学员对工会的性质和任务以及工会工作得到统一的了解。然后学习有关各专门业务的现行政策法令。在这个基础上，选择典型报告，经过小组讨论，以相互交流经验，提出改进自己工作的具体方法。在第六期开办建筑班时，又添加了先进工作经验的实习表演一课，用事实说明保守观念和经验主义是要不得的，奠定了组织和教育群众学习先进经验的基础。学员反映：“谁不信就可表演看看！”这是业务课中内容最丰富的一课。
    东北工人政治大学通过爱国公约、黑板报、广播站等形式，进行经常性的宣传鼓动工作，对学员们的学习起了很大的推动和保证作用。爱国公约是以工会小组（即学习小组）为单位而订立的，公约的内容是以学习为中心，联系学员中存在着的缺点，条文简明、通俗、切合实际，一般都在五条左右。每人根据自己的情况，订出实践公约的保证条文，在每晚正课学习后的十分钟快会上检查公约的执行情况。黑板报每班都有两块，每周出两次，及时批判各种错误思想，介绍各种典型经验，并插有图画，使文化水平较低的学员也能了解文字的内容。广播站在每天早晨早操后到早饭前的半小时内进行广播，内容是总结学习经验，有时由学习成绩较好的学员报告自己的学习经验，用具体事例来纠正某些学员的不正确思想，激发大家的学习热情，巩固并提高已有的学习成绩。
    在紧张的学习中同时开展适当的文化娱乐和体育活动，也是保证完成学习任务的重要条件。在东北工人政治大学里，每日午后有两小时自由活动的时间，星期六晚上是文化娱乐活动时间，或演话剧，或放电影，或开跳舞会。学习时间较长的班，有时自编、自导、自演话剧或歌剧。游艺室里，有乒乓球、象棋、扑克、跳棋、围棋等。到了休息日或假日，游艺室里特别热闹，充满了欢乐的气氛。
    在体育活动方面，早起后做早操、跑步，午后自由活动时间，则打篮球、排球、踢足球、翻单杠，有时也进行劳动建校活动。每年春季，植树种菜，绿化校园；夏天除草；平时修建操场、院路，建筑假山。仅一九五一年春季，即植树一万九千余棵。一九五二年建筑班两个月内劳动五万余小时。学员们在劳动建校中充分表现了工人阶级的优良品质和高度的劳动热情。
    在日常生活方面，无论上课、开会、吃饭，都是有组织地列队出发，保持着严整的秩序，表现了工人阶级的纪律性。无论室内、室外、走廊、便所，都经常打扫得干干净净；玻璃、门窗、桌椅，经常揩拭；睡床、被褥，力求整洁。在环境卫生方面，常常进行竞赛，各班互相比较、学习。
    总而言之，东北工人政治大学在课堂内外各方面的活动，都给人以严肃而又活泼的印象。它在非常活跃的气氛中进行严肃的政治教育、思想教育、文化教育。
    东北工人政治大学在成立后的短短的三年中，已为祖国培养了成批的优秀的工人干部，他们在经济建设的战线上发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，许多人并已成为工业建设中的骨干。如三期毕业学员沈阳麻袋厂工会主席宋振远，由于组织生产著有成绩，已被选为沈阳市总工会副主席。
