　　Workers and Peasants Unleash Creativity to Build a Great Motherland
　　Jin Hongle, a Farmer from Thirteen Districts on the Outskirts of Beijing
　　Creates a "Wheat Aphid Pusher" to Capture and Kill Aphids
　　Increases Efficiency Tenfold Compared to Manual Capture
　　To the Editor: Jin Hongle, a farmer from Guangyuanzha Administrative Village in the western suburbs of Beijing, is the village's production technology committee member. During the recent campaign to capture and kill wheat aphids, he referred to the method of using a dustpan tied to a three-pronged fork for threshing grain to capture wheat aphids, as described in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on April 17th, and created a "Wheat Aphid Pusher." Using it to capture wheat aphids, he can push three mu of land in as little as one hour. One push can capture 70% of the wheat aphids, and two pushes can eliminate all the wheat aphids. This is ten times more efficient than manual capture and 80% more efficient than using a dustpan. The "Wheat Aphid Pusher" is also suitable for capturing red spiders. The "Wheat Aphid Pusher" is not only highly efficient in capturing insects but also light, easy to make, and low in cost, making it easy for ordinary farmers to imitate. The local (Thirteenth District) government attaches great importance to this innovation and organized cadres and farmers from nearby villages to visit and try it out at the end of April. They are now mobilizing the masses to imitate it on a large scale. To promote the widespread use of the "Wheat Aphid Pusher" in rural areas across the country, I would like to introduce its manufacturing method and usage in the newspaper.
　　Manufacturing method: First, make a rectangular wooden frame two chi two cun long and one chi four cun wide (the width can be increased or decreased according to the wheat ridge), and nail a thin iron plate or canvas on top (called the insect board), as shown in Figure 1. Install a wooden wheel on each side of the wooden frame about eight cun from the front (called the "terrain wheel," with a diameter of six to seven cun), with a groove in the middle, as shown in Figure 2. Install two inclined wooden pieces at the front end of the wooden frame, connected at the upper end, as shown in Figure 3. Use bamboo or thicker iron wire to make an insect-catching wheel (shaped like a harvester or a cotton spinning wheel), and place it in the middle of the inclined wood, about two cun five fen from the front end of the insect board, as shown in Figure 4. Install a small wooden wheel (diameter four cun five fen) at one end of the insect-catching wheel, as shown in Figure 5. Then use a rope to connect it to the terrain wheel, as shown in Figure 6. Install a three-chi-long wooden handle at one end of the wooden frame, as shown in Figure 7.
　　Usage: First, apply a layer of thin batter on the insect-catching board, then one person picks up the "handle" and pushes the cart forward along the wheat ridge. As the terrain wheel rotates, it drives the small wooden wheel, which in turn drives the insect-catching wheel. The lead wires of the insect-catching wheel rotate backward, rolling and hitting the wheat seedlings. The wheat aphids on the wheat seedlings are rolled onto the insect-catching board, where they are stuck by the batter and cannot fly away. It is best to capture during the afternoon or evening when the wheat aphids are active. Capturing in the morning is likely to damage the wheat seedlings. In addition, be careful to use it before the wheat seedlings bud, as the wheat stalks are hard and brittle after budding, and are also easily damaged.

　　Lin Ruicai, Iron Riveter at Fujiatan Coal Mine
　　Reforms the Air Blower, Increasing Air Volume by Three and a Half Times, Overcoming Production Increase Difficulties
　　To the Editor: The Zhang Yanwen Model Production Group of the Repair Department of Fujiatan Coal Mine recently added four furnaces without increasing the number of workers. This group has only one ten-horsepower air blower; insufficient wind power has become a major obstacle to their increased production. Lin Ruicai is an iron riveter in this group. Seeing that this problem was very serious, he squatted by the blower for several days in a row, inspecting the rotation, and listening quietly to the roar, discovering that the blower sounded loud but muffled. He began to study further, realizing that this blower had many problems. The entire blower's air duct was small, and the exhaust was not smooth; the fan blades were also straight, providing little space for air and generating little driving force, as well as great friction. He told these opinions to a certain technician, who explained the structural principles to him. Based on the shape of the water pump, he measured and drew templates, and then studied with the technician to change the straight fan blades to streamlined ones, and improved the size of the air duct. Combining experience and theory, the blower was quickly reformed. The workers in the repair department were so happy to see the difficulties solved that they jumped up. The reformed blower has four advantages: it provides more space for air, generates greater driving force, produces less friction, and has a larger air volume. The old blower had an air volume of 70 cubic meters per minute, while the new blower has an air volume of 249 cubic meters, increasing the air volume by three and a half times. This will greatly contribute to the repair department's completion of this year's production increase and savings plan.

　　Deng Shou'an, Worker at Beijing Machine Factory
　　Improves the Tool Rest, Increasing Work Efficiency More Than Tenfold
　　To the Editor: In April, the tool team of the Beijing Machine Factory accepted the task of manufacturing a batch of tool rests for lathes. This batch of work required processing on four sides and had to be done on a planer. However, there were few planers, a lot of work, and an urgent task, which presented a difficulty. Deng Shou'an, a worker on the tool team, thought: "These are tools for welcoming the great May production competition, and should be supplied to the machinists in a timely manner, otherwise production will be affected." What to do? After thinking about it for two or three days, he decided to find a way on the existing machine tools without waiting for more planers, so as not to delay the work. After many researches and experiments, he succeeded. He took all the small tool rests off the engine lathe, installed flat-jaw pliers, and clamped the tool rest into the jaws. On the large tool rest, he installed four diamond steel knives using high-speed cutting methods, and then used multi-knife and multi-edge cutting methods to turn a tool rest in just one minute and fifteen seconds. This not only solved the difficulty of the shortage of planers, but also increased work efficiency by more than ten times compared to working on a planer, allowing the tool team to complete the task on schedule.

　　工人农民发挥创造能力建设伟大祖国
    北京市郊十三区农民金鸿乐
    创造“推麦蚜车”捕打蚜虫
    比人工捕打效率提高十倍
    编辑同志：北京市西郊广源闸行政村农民金鸿乐是村的生产技术委员。在这次捕打麦蚜虫运动中，他参照四月十七日人民日报“读者来信”栏介绍的用簸箕绑在打场用的三股杈上捕打麦蚜虫的方法，创造了“推麦蚜车”。用它捕打麦蚜虫，快时一点钟可推三亩地，推一次便可捕完百分之七十的麦蚜虫，推两次就可把麦蚜虫全部消灭。这比用人工捕打效率高十倍，比用簸箕捕打的效率高百分之八十。“推麦蚜车”也适用于捕打红蜘蛛。“推麦蚜车”不只捕虫效率高，而且轻便易制，成本很低，普通农民都能仿制。当地（十三区）政府对这项创造很重视，已在四月底组织附近村的干部、农民前往参观试用，现正发动群众大量仿制。为了使“推麦蚜车”能广泛地在全国各地农村中推广，我愿把它的制法和用法在报上加以介绍。
    制法：先作长二尺二寸、宽一尺四寸（宽度可根据麦垅情况增减）的长方形木框，上面钉薄铁板或帆布一块（名盛虫板），如图一。在木框前约八寸处两旁各按一木轮（叫做“地形轮”，直径六寸到七寸），中间要有槽，如图二。在木框前端安装两根斜木，上端连起，如图三。用竹或较粗的铁丝制成捕虫轮（形式像收割机或纺棉花车的车轮），安放于斜木中间，距盛虫板前端约二寸五，如图四。在捕虫轮的一端安一木制小轮（直径四寸五），如图五。再用绳把它和地形轮连起来，如图六。在木框一端装一个三尺长的木把手，如图七。
    用法：先在捕虫板上涂一层稀面糊，然后一个人拿起“手把”，顺着麦垅往前推车。由于地形轮转动，连带小木轮转动，捕虫轮便也转动。捕虫轮的铅丝向后转，卷打麦苗，麦苗上的麦蚜虫便被卷落在捕虫板上，捕虫板上有面糊，虫就被黏住飞不掉了。捕捉时间最好在下午或傍晚正当麦蚜活动时间，早上捕打麦苗容易被损折。此外要注意在麦苗打苞以前使用，因麦苗打苞后麦秆硬而脆也易损折。

    富家滩煤矿铁铆工人林瑞才
    改造送风机增大风量三倍半克服了增产的困难
    编辑同志：富家滩煤矿修理部张彦文模范生产组，最近在不增加工人的情况下，增加了四盘炉。这个组只有一个十马力送风机；风力不足，已成为阻碍他们增产的一个主要问题。林瑞才是这个组的铁铆工匠，他看到这个问题十分严重，曾一连数天蹲在风机旁，视察转动，静听吼声，发现风机声大音闷。他开始进一步研究，知道这个风机的毛病很多。整个风机的风道小，出风不顺；风页又是直线形，窝风少，推动力小，摩擦力大。他把这些意见告诉了某技师，技师对他讲了构造原理。他根据水泵构造形状，测划样板，然后和技师共同研究，把直线风页改为流线形，再改进风道的尺寸。经验和理论相结合，很快地改造了风机。修理部的工人眼看解决了困难，都高兴得跳起来。改造了的风机有四个好处：窝风多；推动力大；摩擦力小；风量大。旧风机每分钟风量为七十立方公尺，新风机为二百四十九立方公尺，增大风量三倍半。这将对修理部完成今年增产节约计划起很大作用。

    北京机器厂工人邓寿安
    改进制刀杠工具，提高工作效率十倍以上
    编辑同志：北京机器厂工具班，四月份接受制造一批车床用的刀杠的任务。这批活需四面加工，并必须在刨车上工作。但刨车少，活儿多，任务急，这是一个困难。工具班工人邓寿安想：“这是为了迎接伟大的五月生产大竞赛用的工具，应该及时供给机工使用，否则生产就会受到影响。”怎么办呢？他脑子里想了两三天后，决定不等增加刨车，就在现有机床上想办法，免得耽误工作。经过多次的研究和试验，结果成功了。他把元车上的小刀架子，全部拿下来，另行装上平口钳子，把刀杆夹到钳子口里；在大刀架子上，用高速切削法安上四把钻石钢刀，再用多刀多刃切削法，把一个刀杆车到头，只用一分十五秒钟就完成了。这不但解决了刨车缺少的困难，还比较在刨车上作活提高工作效率十倍以上，使工具班按期完成了任务。
