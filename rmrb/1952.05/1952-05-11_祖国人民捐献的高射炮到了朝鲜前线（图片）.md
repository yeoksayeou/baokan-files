   (4) The gunners had been waiting anxiously. The anti-aircraft guns followed the enemy planes as they turned. With the order given, this batch of anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland fought the enemy for the first time in Korea. The black sky was instantly pierced by several red lights, and the dense artillery fire surrounded the enemy planes. The enemy planes panicked, not caring to drop bombs or strafe, and tried to escape, but shells had already hit one of the enemy planes, its tail emitting a burst of flame as it fell southward.
    (5) Immediately afterwards, applause and cheers rang out around the bridge. The car drivers praised, "The anti-aircraft artillerymen are highly skilled, able to shoot down enemy planes even in the dark!" The gunners excitedly told people, "These are good guns donated by the people of the motherland, and they have already achieved a great feat immediately after being transported from the motherland!"
    (6) The gunners remaining at the anti-aircraft artillery battalion’s station fought enemy planes during the day, and at night braved the cold wind, ice, and snow, busily "settling" the new guns that were about to arrive. The gunners of the fourth squad of the third platoon spent two nights setting up the new guns' "homes". Everyone looked forward to the anti-aircraft guns donated by the people of the motherland arriving one after another, like looking forward to relatives. Some ran to the roadside to wait, staring at every passing car, and some were still waiting late into the night.

   （四）炮手们早就在紧张地等待着了。高射炮的炮口跟着敌机在转动。命令一下，这批祖国人民捐献的高射炮在朝鲜第一次向敌人作战了。黑色的天幕顿时给几道红光冲破，密集的炮火把敌机包围了。敌机慌乱了，顾不得投弹扫射就想逃跑，但是炮弹已经击中了那架敌机，尾巴上冒着一股火焰一直向南坠落下去。
    （五）接着，桥的四周响起了一阵掌声和欢呼声。汽车司机们纷纷赞扬说：“高射炮兵好本领，在黑夜也能打下敌机来！”炮手们兴冲冲地告诉人们说：“这是祖国人民捐献的好炮，才从祖国运来就立了头功！”
    （六）留在高射炮营驻地的炮手们白天和敌机搏斗，夜里就冒着寒风冰雪，忙着给快要来到的新炮“安家”。三连四班的炮手们花了两夜功夫，就把新炮的家安置好了。大家都像盼望亲人似地盼望着祖国人民捐献的高射炮赶快陆续地来到，有些跑到路边去等着，盯着驶过的每一辆汽车，有的直到深夜还在等着。
