Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: TASS Moscow, May 21st: Soviet newspapers on the 21st published articles criticizing the towering crimes of the American aggressors in Korea. *Izvestia*, in an article entitled "Against the Bloody Crimes of American Imperialists," said: The crimes of the American aggressors in maltreating prisoners of war on Geoje Island have added to their already numerous crimes committed during the two years of intervention in Korea. The American imperialists' shameless violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War has completely exposed their brutal faces to hundreds of millions of people in every corner of the world. Now, people of all countries are more clearly aware of what they will encounter if they allow the American aggressors to ignite another world war.

*Izvestia* continued, the heroic sons and daughters of Korea and the Korean People's Army, with the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, are waging a heroic struggle. This struggle shows that the American imperialists cannot enslave a nation that has begun to build a new life. The American interventionists are determined to intensify their criminal activities against Korean civilians to make up for their failures in Korea, using napalm bombs to burn down cities and villages. The American imperialists have begun to use barbaric bacteriological weapons that are prohibited. They are determined not to let world opinion know about their actions. But the people of all countries have learned how to identify the enemies of peace and expose their brutal acts in a timely manner. The criminals who launched bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China have been identified.

*Izvestia* then said: The bloody persecution of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Geoje Island and Busan once again exposes the falsehood and hypocrisy of the American imperialists' pronouncements about "humanity" and "civilization" in order to cover up their crimes.

*Izvestia* concluded: More and more millions of people are expressing their indignation at the bloody crimes committed by the American imperialists, believing that the American atrocities in Korea are a direct threat to their countries, their hometowns, and their families. The people of all countries around the world are raising their vigilance against the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers, further consolidating their ranks, and strengthening the struggle to defend and consolidate peace, responding to the towering crimes of the American aggressors with action.

*Labor Daily* published an editorial entitled "The Towering Crimes of the American Aggressors," saying: The facts of the unspeakable crimes committed by the American army on Geoje Island have been exposed to world opinion. General Colson, the former commander of the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp of the American army, has already admitted these facts. Therefore, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson cannot issue his usual "denial" statement. The murderers have run out of road in the face of irrefutable facts and documents. The American military authorities are preparing to carry out new massacres in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. American tanks have been deployed around the prisoner-of-war camps detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners. Cannons and machine guns have been aimed at the prisoner-of-war camps. The American *Worker's Daily* reported: Troops are landing on Geoje Island, preparing to carry out brutal retaliatory persecution against the leaders of the prisoners of war who made the world aware of the truth.

*Labor Daily* said, let the imperialists remember: the people of the world will never forgive the American war criminals who have spilled the blood of peaceful people all over the land of Korea! Geoje Island is another Majdanek, another powerful piece of evidence in the indictment accusing the war criminals who spread plague and cholera germs, accusing the most heinous enemy of all mankind, American imperialism.

*Pravda's* foreign press review, entitled "The Anger of Progressive Humanity," summarized foreign press comments on American crimes on Geoje Island. The review said: The crimes and atrocities of the American imperialists have exceeded the executioner's methods of the Hitler bandits. Hundreds of millions of people in all countries around the world condemn the American imperialists with contempt and anger. The death camp on Geoje Island, like Majdanek and Auschwitz, proves that the imperialist aggressors will not hesitate to commit any crime in order to carry out their mad plan to dominate the world.

*Pravda* then quoted the condemnation of American aggressors' crimes by various democratic newspapers, and said: The bourgeois newspapers and news agencies cannot deny either: in the American prisoner-of-war camps, there exists a horrifying reign of hunger, torture, and slaughter. The Associated Press also admitted: Geoje Island has become an island of terror, with torture and slaughter filling the daily lives of the captured personnel with terror. The criminals, unable to deny the conclusive evidence, are furious. It is clear from the reports of news agencies and newspapers that General Boatner, the new prisoner-of-war camp commander sent by Washington to "restore order" on Geoje Island, is preparing to carry out a new massacre of prisoners of war. The newspapers are full of news that the American command is sending more troops to Geoje Island, and the American army is surrounding the prisoner-of-war camps with tanks.

While condemning the bloody crimes of the American interventionist army, peace-loving people are raising their vigilance and fighting more resolutely for world peace.

    苏联各报痛斥美国侵略者屠杀我被俘人员
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联各报在二十一日刊载了评论美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行的文章。“消息报”在题为“反对美帝国主义者的血腥罪行”的论文中说：美国侵略者虐待巨济岛战俘的罪行，使他们在干涉朝鲜两年中所犯的已经不算少的罪行更加增多了。美帝国主义者无耻地违反日内瓦战俘公约的行为，把他们那副残暴嘴脸在全世界各个角落的亿万人民面前完全揭穿了。现在各国人民更清楚地认识到，假如让美国侵略者点起另一次世界大战的战火的话，他们将会遭遇到什么。
    “消息报”继续说，朝鲜的英勇儿女和朝鲜人民军，在中国人民志愿军的援助下进行着英勇的斗争，这个斗争说明了美帝国主义者要想奴役一个已开始在建立新生活的民族，那是办不到的。美国干涉者决心加紧对朝鲜平民进行罪恶活动，借以弥补他们在朝鲜所遭受的失败，他们用凝固汽油弹把城市和乡村一个个全部烧光。美帝国主义者已开始使用被禁止使用的野蛮的细菌武器。他们决意不让世界舆论知道他们这种行径。但各国人民已学会了怎样去辨认和平的敌人，并及时揭发他们的残暴行为。在朝鲜和中国东北发动细菌战的罪犯已经被认明了。
    “消息报”接着说：巨济岛和釜山的朝中战俘所受到的血腥迫害，再一次暴露了美帝国主义者为了掩饰自己的罪行而发表的关于什么“人道”和“文明”一类言论的虚假和伪善。
    “消息报”最后说：越来越多的千百万人民，都对美帝国主义者犯下的血腥罪行表示愤慨，他们认为：美国在朝鲜的暴行就是对于他们的国家、他们的家乡和他们的家庭的直接威胁。全世界各国人民正在对帝国主义战争贩子们的阴谋提高警惕，进一步巩固他们的队伍，并加强维护和巩固和平的斗争，以行动来答复美国侵略者这种滔天的罪行。
    “劳动报”以“美国侵略者的滔天罪行”为题发表社论说：美军在巨济岛上干下难以形容的罪行的事实，已经暴露在世界舆论的面前了。美军前巨济岛战俘营长官柯尔生将军已经供认了这些事实。因此，美国国务卿艾奇逊就无法发表他的照例的“否认”声明了。杀人凶犯们在无可争辩的事实和文件面前已经走头无路了。美国军事当局正准备在巨济岛战俘营中进行新的屠杀。美国坦克已经布置在拘留朝鲜和中国被俘人员的战俘营周围。炮和机关枪已经瞄准战俘营。美国“工人日报”报道：军队正在巨济岛登陆，准备对那些使世界得悉事实真相的战俘的领袖们进行残暴的报复性迫害。
    “劳动报”说，让帝国主义者记住：世界人民决不饶恕那些使和平人民的鲜血流遍朝鲜土地的美国战争罪犯们！巨济岛是另一个麦丹尼克，它在控诉散布鼠疫和霍乱病菌的战争罪犯们、控诉全人类最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义者的起诉书中，是另一个有力的罪证。
    “真理报”的外国报纸述评以“进步人类的愤怒”为题，综述外国报纸关于美国在巨济岛的罪行的评论。述评说：美帝国主义者的罪恶和暴行，已经超过了希特勒匪徒的刽子手手段。世界各国千百万人民，都以鄙夷和愤怒的心情斥责美帝国主义者。巨济岛上的死亡营与麦丹尼克和奥斯威辛一样，证明帝国主义侵略者为了执行他们的称霸世界的疯狂计划，是不惜干出任何罪行的。
    “真理报”接着引述了各民主报纸对美国侵略者罪行的斥责，并说：资产阶级的报纸和通讯社也不能否认：在美国的战俘营中，存在着令人发指的饥饿、酷刑和屠杀的统治。合众社也承认：巨济岛已经变成了恐怖之岛，酷刑和屠杀使被俘者的日常生活中充满了恐怖。罪犯们由于罪证确凿，无法狡赖，就恼羞成怒。从通讯社和报纸的报道中可以很明显地看出：华盛顿派去“恢复”巨济岛“秩序”的新战俘营长官波纳将军正在准备对战俘进行新的屠杀。各报都充满了这样的消息：美国司令部正在增调军队到巨济岛去，美军正在用坦克包围战俘营。
    爱好和平的人民一面斥责美国干涉军的血腥罪行，一面提高警惕，并更加坚决地为世界和平而斗争。
