    ▲ Qi Jianhua's quick literacy method has been tested among workers in Shanghai and has achieved good results. At the beginning of March this year, the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Spare-time Education Committee conducted a pilot quick literacy class, drawing forty female workers from the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory to participate in the study. They originally knew an average of about 190 characters each. After eight weeks of study (an actual class time of 253.5 hours), they now know an average of 1,932 characters each. They are all able to write simple letters and read popular newspapers and periodicals such as "Labor Daily" and "Worker" semi-monthly.
    On the morning of May 18, the experimental class held a graduation ceremony and exhibited their learning achievements. Tan Zhenlin, member of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Liu Changsheng, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Meng Xiancheng, Minister of Education of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Dai Baitao, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Spare-time Education Committee, attended the ceremony and encouraged everyone to continue to study hard. Tan Zhenlin pointed out in his speech that Shanghai should systematically and universally promote the quick literacy method, and strive to enable every worker in Shanghai to know two to three thousand or even more characters within one or two years, so that they all have the opportunity to master modern science and technology and become people with high cultural and political literacy.
    ▲ Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association was established by the Shanghai TCM community. After several months of hard work by all the preparatory committee members, they united the majority of Western medicine doctors and professors from medical colleges to create Chinese medicine advanced training classes. There are now over a thousand Chinese medicine practitioners enrolled in the seven advanced training classes that have already started.
    The Chinese medicine advanced training classes utilize the buildings of medical colleges, hospitals, or middle schools as classrooms from 6 to 10 pm. The professors are all professors from medical colleges and well-known doctors from various hospitals. The teaching content includes courses such as politics, physiology, anatomy, pharmacology, pathology, bacteriology, histology, and public health. The teaching method adopts visual teaching and hands-on teaching, which general Chinese medicine practitioners can understand; the students have automatically organized after-school mutual aid groups, conducting discussions at the time specified by each group, and each group has formulated patriotic covenants to ensure that they are not absent, late, or leave early, so as to improve their political and professional levels. The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association is currently preparing the eighth and ninth Chinese medicine advanced training classes.
    ▲ The tenth issue of "Current Affairs Handbook" has been published. The central content of this issue is to commemorate the second anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression. The main articles include "The Second Anniversary of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression," "The Entire Korean People Are Fighting Against the American Aggressors," "The Fighting and Life of the Volunteer Army Soldiers," and "The Fighting Friendship Between the Chinese and Korean People." There are also three pieces of information, which respectively narrate the confession of the failure of the American robbers' war of aggression against Korea, the bankruptcy of the American "air superiority," and the course of the Korean armistice negotiations.
    In addition, there are ten paintings depicting the situation of the Korean War of Resistance Against Aggression over the past two years.

    ▲祁建华所创造的速成识字法在上海工人中间进行实验，已获得很好的效果。今年三月初，上海市职工业余教育委员会试办第一个工人速成识字法实验班，从国营上海棉纺织第一厂抽调了四十个女工参加学习，她们原来平均每人大约认识一百九十多个字。经过八个星期的学习（实际上课时间为二百五十三小时半），现在平均每人识字数已增加到一千九百三十二个。大家都已能写简单的信和阅读“劳动报”和“工人”半月刊等通俗书报。
    五月十八日上午，这个实验班举行结业典礼，并展览学习成绩。中共中央华东局委员谭震林，上海市总工会主席刘长胜，华东军政委员会教育部长孟宪承，上海市职工业余教育委员会主任委员戴白韬等都前往参加典礼，并勉励大家继续努力学习。谭震林在讲话中指出，上海应该有计划地普遍地推行速成识字法，争取在一、两年内使上海市的每一工人都能认识二、三千字甚至更多的字，使他们都有可能掌握近代科学技术，成为具有高度文化和政治素养的人。
    ▲上海市中医界在上海市卫生局的领导下，筹办了上海市中医学会，经过全体筹备委员数月的努力，团结广大西医和医学院的教授，普遍创办了中医进修班。现在已经开课的七个中医进修班内即有千余名中医入学进修。
    中医进修班是利用晚上六至十时借用医学院，医院或中学的房舍作为课堂。教授都是医学院的教授及各医院的有名大夫。教学的内容有政治、生理、解剖、药理、病理、细菌、组织及公共卫生学等课程。教学方法是采用形像教学，实物试教，一般中医都能听懂；学员们自动的组织了课余互助小组，按每组各自规定的时间进行讨论，各组都制订爱国公约，作到不缺课、不迟到、不早退，来提高政治和业务水平。上海市中医学会现正筹办第八、九中医进修班。
    ▲“时事手册”第十期已经出版。这一期的中心内容是纪念朝鲜反侵略战争两周年，主要文章有“朝鲜反侵略战争两周年”、“全朝鲜人民都在和美国侵略者作战”、“志愿军战士的战斗和生活”、“中朝人民的战斗友谊”。还有三篇资料，分别叙述了美国强盗侵朝战争失败的自供、美国“空中优势”的破产和朝鲜停战谈判经过。
    此外，还有十幅画，描绘朝鲜反侵略战争两年来的情况。
