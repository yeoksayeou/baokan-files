    Millet Production Model Worker Shao Shuanghe
    Plans to Produce 1,120 Jin Per Mu of Millet on Two Mu This Year
    Respected Chairman Mao: In the patriotic production increase movement of 1951, I harvested 845 jin per mu on my 1.8 mu of millet, and was honored with the glorious title of National Millet Production Model Worker. I feel that this is not just my glory, but also the glory of the Party.
    I listened to your words and organized a mutual aid team in 1949, practicing deep plowing and careful cultivation, which is the main reason for the increase in harvest. In addition, the government's loans for fertilizers and the workers' supply of waterwheels are also reasons for the increased production.
    Dear Chairman Mao: Although my millet has achieved high yields, I cannot be complacent. In the future, I must patiently unite the broad masses, exchange experiences in high-yield production, and create even greater high-yield achievements on the basis of last year's high yield. I plan to plant two mu of millet again this year, striving to produce 1,120 jin per mu, an increase of 275 jin compared to last year. I will also plant two mu of high-yield cotton, striving to produce 800 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 280 jin compared to last year.

    计划今年二亩谷子每亩产一千一百二十斤
    敬爱的毛主席：在一九五一年的爱国丰产运动中，我种的一亩八分谷子，每亩收获八百四十五斤，荣获全国谷子丰产模范的光荣称号。我觉得这不只是我的光荣，而且是党的光荣。
    我听了你的话，在一九四九年就组织起互助组，实行深耕细作，这是收成增加的主要原因。另外，政府贷给我们肥料，工人供给我们水车，都是丰产的原因。
    亲爱的毛主席：我的谷子虽然得到丰产，但是我还不能自满，今后我更要耐心地团结广大群众，交流丰产经验，在去年的丰产基础上，创造更大的丰产成绩。我计划今年再回茬二亩谷子，每亩争取产一千一百二十斤，比去年增产二百七十五斤。我还种二亩丰产棉花，每亩争取产籽棉八百斤，比去年增产二百八十斤。
