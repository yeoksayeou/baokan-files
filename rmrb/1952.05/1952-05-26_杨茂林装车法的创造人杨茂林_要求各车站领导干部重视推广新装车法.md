To the Editor:

My loading method is mainly for loading more goods, saving railcars, reducing accidents, and increasing the country's transportation capacity. The China Changchun Railway Administration has universally promoted this loading method and achieved great results. In addition, some stations have also promoted this loading method, increasing loading capacity. However, some station employees still do not fully understand the role of this loading method and have not actively promoted it. Recently, I visited the Baqu Station near Harbin. This station has not promoted it well, and the loading capacity of the vehicles has not been increased. Each full-load less-than-carload (LCL) vehicle only carried twenty-one tons of goods. Why is this? As far as I understand, the main reason is that the leading cadres have not attached importance to the promotion of this new loading method and have not specifically helped workers solve difficulties. For example, some workers said: "The operations department never delivers cars on time, which affects our loading work." However, the leading cadres did not promptly tell the operations department about this issue and ask them to improve quickly. Therefore, this problem has not been resolved so far, affecting the promotion of the new loading method. In fact, this problem is easy to solve. I remember that when I adopted the "Plan for Transportation of Less-than-Carload Goods," I also encountered such a problem. But I consulted with the operations department and established a liaison contract, which overcame the phenomenon of untimely car delivery. In addition, some people look down on commercial work, thinking that this work is "nothing," and the leading cadres have not strengthened education for them, which also affects the promotion of the new loading method. I hope that all stations will pay attention to solving these problems and tell me about the difficulties in promoting the new loading method.

    杨茂林装车法的创造人杨茂林
    要求各车站领导干部重视推广新装车法
    编辑同志：我的装车方法，主要是为了多装货物，节省车皮，减少事故，增加国家运输的力量。中长铁路管理局普遍地推行了这个装车法，取得了很大的成绩。另外还有些车站也推行了这个装车法，提高了装载量。但有些车站的员工还不大了解这个装车法的作用，还没有积极地推广。最近，我曾访问了哈尔滨附近的八区车站。这个车站就没有很好地推广，车辆的装载量还没有提高，每辆整装零担车只装了二十一吨货物。为什么这样呢？据我了解，主要的原因是领导干部没有重视推广这个新的装车法，不具体帮助工人解决困难。比如，有的工人说：“运转部门老不按时送车，影响我们装车工作。”而领导干部没有及时把这个意见告诉运转部门，要他们赶快改进，因此，这个问题至今未能解决，影响了新装车法的推广。事实上，这个问题是很容易解决的。我记得，在我采用“零担货物计划运送办法”的时候，也曾发生过这样的问题。但我和运转部门商量，订立了联系合同，就克服了送车不及时的现象。此外，有些人看不起商务工作，以为这个工作“没有啥”，领导干部也没有对他们加强教育，这也影响了新装车法的推广。我希望各车站注意解决这些问题，并把推广新装车法的困难告诉我。
