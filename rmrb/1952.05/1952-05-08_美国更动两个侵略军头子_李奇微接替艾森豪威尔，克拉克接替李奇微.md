Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Washington dispatch: US President Truman announced on the 28th the appointment of Ridgway to succeed the soon-to-be-departing Eisenhower as the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. The appointment will take effect on June 1st. Truman also announced the appointment of Clark, the current commander of the US Army Ground Forces, to succeed Ridgway.

Eisenhower is the candidate sought by American monopoly capitalists to replace Truman and more effectively implement America's militarization and policy of foreign military expansion. A section of influential Republicans and many large bourgeois newspapers have launched campaign activities for him. Eisenhower submitted his resignation on April 2nd to prepare to return home for the presidential campaign.

When announcing Clark's appointment, Truman particularly emphasized that Clark will continue to implement Ridgway's aggressive policies in Korea. When the US government's official US Information Service embellished Clark's resume, it added a noteworthy sentence at the end: When Clark served as the commander of the US Fifth Army in World War II, a Japanese combat unit was under his command.

    美国更动两个侵略军头子
    李奇微接替艾森豪威尔，克拉克接替李奇微
    【新华社三十日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统杜鲁门二十八日宣布任命李奇微继即将离职的艾森豪威尔任北大西洋集团军队最高司令。任命将在六月一日生效。杜鲁门同时宣布任命原美国国内陆军地面部队司令克拉克接替李奇微的职务。
    艾森豪威尔是美国垄断资本家物色来准备代替杜鲁门更有效地执行美国军国主义化和对外军事扩张政策的人选，一部分有势力的共和党人及许多大资产阶级的报刊已为他展开竞选活动，艾森豪威尔为此已在四月二日提出了辞呈，准备回国进行总统竞选。
    杜鲁门在宣布克拉克的任命时特别强调：克拉克将继续执行李奇微在朝鲜的侵略政策。美国政府官方的美国新闻处在渲染克拉克的履历时，最后值得注意地加了一句说：当克拉克在第二次大战中担任美国第五军军长时，在他的统率下，有一支日本人的战斗队。
