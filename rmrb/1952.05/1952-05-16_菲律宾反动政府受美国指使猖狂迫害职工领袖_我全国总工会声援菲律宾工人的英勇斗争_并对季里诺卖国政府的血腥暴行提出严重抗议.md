Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The reactionary Philippine government, under the instigation of its American masters, has recently been persecuting labor leaders with increasing frenzy.

Following the assassination of Gaberto, Vice Chairman of the Congress of Labor Organizations of the Philippines (CLO), on September 27th of last year, the Quirino puppet government illegally sentenced Hernandez, Chairman of the CLO, to life imprisonment and ten other leaders and members of the CLO to ten years imprisonment on March 31st of this year, on the "crime" of plotting to overthrow the government. On April 5th, Fusi Nabiao, a well-known labor leader from Iloilo, who had been arrested in January of last year, was illegally sentenced to death. Eight other patriots were illegally sentenced at the same time as Fusi Nabiao, including Fusi Nabiao's son, Napoleon, and son-in-law, Pamicha.

According to Manila newspaper reports, after the illegal verdict was announced by the Manila City Preliminary Court, Hernandez resolutely stated: "I have unshakable confidence that justice will ultimately triumph." Note: The Congress of Labor Organizations of the Philippines (CLO) is a trade union federation representing Filipino workers, with a total membership of 2 million before it was unreasonably declared "illegal" by the Quirino government in April 1951. It is a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

This unreasonable atrocity by the reactionary Philippine government will inevitably arouse anger and protest from the broad masses of the Filipino people and all peace-loving people around the world. The Filipino people, with decades of struggle experience, will respond to the offensive of the US-Philippine reactionaries with even more powerful blows.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The Quirino puppet government of the Philippines, under the instigation of its American masters, is stepping up its persecution of the Philippine working class and their leaders, which has aroused great anger among all peace-loving people. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has specifically written to the Philippine workers to express its support and has lodged a serious protest with the reactionary Quirino government.

The letter of support to the Philippine workers is as follows:
Philippine worker brothers:

The Chinese working class and all working people are deeply concerned about your heroic struggle against the reactionary Quirino government for independence and democracy. The increasingly rampant persecution of the working class and its outstanding leaders by the reactionary Philippine government demonstrates the growing strength of the Philippine working class, and the warmongers and their loyal lackeys are trembling before this power. This brutal persecution completely deprives the Philippine working class and all Filipinos of the rights to democracy, freedom, and survival, and seeks to suppress the Philippine people's national liberation struggle for national independence against US imperialist aggression and traitors. This is not only a disaster for the Filipino people, but also threatens peace in all of Asia and the world. Your heroic struggle has earned the lofty respect of workers around the world, especially the Chinese working class.

The Chinese working class not only fully understands the suffering currently endured by the Philippine working class, but also firmly believes that the Philippine working class and patriotic people will become increasingly united and victorious in the struggle against the brutal enemy. The Chinese working class and all working people fully support your just struggle and extend our sincere brotherly greetings to the illegally arrested leaders!

We have lodged a serious protest with the reactionary Quirino government.

All-China Federation of Trade Unions

The full text of the protest to the Philippine government is as follows:
Philippine Government:

With unparalleled anger, we read the news that your government, disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, has once again persecuted the Philippine working class and its outstanding leaders, following the assassination of Gaberto, Vice Chairman of the Congress of Labor Organizations of the Philippines, on September 27th of last year. On behalf of the Chinese working class and all working people, we lodge a serious protest against the series of bloody crimes committed by your government under the instigation of its American masters, and demand that your government immediately cease all acts of unreasonable persecution against the working class, immediately and unconditionally release all illegally arrested labor leaders, and immediately revoke the unreasonable and barbaric sentences against them.

All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    菲律宾反动政府受美国指使猖狂迫害职工领袖
    我全国总工会声援菲律宾工人的英勇斗争
    并对季里诺卖国政府的血腥暴行提出严重抗议
    【新华社十五日讯】菲律宾反动政府在其美国主子的指使之下，最近正越来越猖狂地迫害职工领袖。
    季里诺傀儡政府继去年九月二十七日杀害了菲律宾劳工组织大会副主席加伯多西亚之后，又在今年三月三十一日以图谋推翻政府的“罪名”非法判处劳工组织大会主席赫南德兹无期徒刑及该会其他十位领袖和会员十年徒刑，在四月五日非法判处于去年一月间被捕的全菲闻名的怡朗职工领袖扶西·那描死刑。和扶西·那描同时被非法判刑的还有八个爱国志士，其中包括扶西·那描的儿子纳坡仑和女婿帕梅查。
    据马尼拉报纸消息，在马尼拉市初级法庭宣布了非法的判决词后，赫南德兹曾坚决地表示：“我对于正义的终将获得最后胜利，有着不可动摇的信心。”按：劳工组织大会是代表菲律宾工人的一个工会联合会，在一九五一年四月间被季里诺政府无理宣布为“非法”之前，共拥有会员二百万人，为世界工会联合会的会员。
    菲律宾反动政府这种无理暴行，必将引起菲律宾广大人民及全世界爱好和平人民的愤怒和抗议。有着数十年斗争经验的菲律宾人民，必将以更有力的打击来回答美菲反动派的进攻。
    【新华社十五日讯】菲律宾季里诺傀儡政府在其美国主子指使之下，加紧迫害菲律宾工人阶级和他们的领袖，这已激起所有爱好和平的人民的极大愤怒，中华全国总工会特写信给菲律宾工人表示声援，并向季里诺反动政府提出严重抗议。
    致菲律宾工人的声援信如下：菲律宾工人兄弟们：
    中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，深切关怀着你们为争取独立、民主而向季里诺反动政府进行的英勇斗争。菲律宾反动政府对工人阶级及其卓越领袖的越来越猖狂的迫害，正说明了菲律宾工人阶级力量的日益壮大，而战争贩子及其忠实走狗在这威力面前发抖了。这种残暴的迫害，完全剥夺了菲律宾工人阶级及一切菲律宾人民的民主、自由与生存的权利，是要镇压菲律宾人民为争取民族独立、反对美帝国主义侵略及卖国贼而进行的民族解放斗争。这不只是菲律宾人民的灾难，而且也威胁着全亚洲和全世界的和平。你们所进行的英勇斗争，获得全世界工人特别是中国工人阶级的崇高的敬意。
    中国工人阶级不仅完全理解菲律宾工人阶级当前所遭受的灾难，而且深信菲律宾工人阶级和爱国人民在对残暴敌人的斗争中，必会日益团结，并获得胜利。中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民全力支持你们的正义斗争，并向被非法逮捕的领袖们致以亲切的兄弟般的慰问！
    我们已向季里诺反动政府提出严重的抗议。
    中华全国总工会
    致菲律宾政府的抗议全文如下：菲律宾政府：
    我们以无比的愤怒阅读了你政府不顾世界人民的反对，继去年九月二十七日杀害了劳工组织大会副主席加伯多西亚后，又一次对菲律宾工人阶级及其卓越领袖进行迫害的消息。我们代表中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，向你政府在美国主子指使下所制造的一连串血腥罪行提出严重的抗议，同时要求你政府立即停止对工人阶级进行无理迫害的一切行为，立即无条件释放所有被非法逮捕的职工领袖，并立即撤销对他们的无理而蛮横的判决。
    中华全国总工会
