Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th. Twenty-nine people's organizations, including the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong and Guangzhou Federation of Trade Unions, held a meeting on the 21st to protest the British government in Hong Kong's persecution of Chinese residents and the illegal trial of the Ta Kung Pao, and expressed their firm support for the Ta Kung Pao, Wen Wei Po, New Evening Post, and the struggle of Hong Kong compatriots to win legitimate rights and interests. More than 1,300 representatives from various groups attended the meeting. More than 30 compatriots, including Qian Zaiyun, Ma Hua, and Huang Jinhui, who were recently deported by the British government in Hong Kong, angrily denounced the brutal acts of the British imperialists at the meeting.

At the beginning of the meeting, Lin Qiangyun, director of the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, spoke, expressing his respect and condolences to the compatriots persecuted by the British imperialists on behalf of the people of Guangdong and Guangzhou. He pointed out: "We cannot tolerate the recent series of atrocities by the British government in Hong Kong against the Chinese people. We will take further practical actions to back up the May 10th protest of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government and support the anti-persecution struggle of Hong Kong compatriots." Zhang Zhennan, a representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, detailed the crimes of the British government in Hong Kong in persecuting Chinese workers at the meeting.

Li Wenxing, Qian Zaiyun, Zhao Jiewen, Yuan Xiangtao, Zhang Bai, Ma Hua, and Huang Jinhui, compatriots who were persecuted by the British government in Hong Kong, successively reported angrily at the meeting about their experiences of being persecuted by British imperialists. Zhao Jiewen, Ma Hua, and Huang Jinhui were seriously injured and had not fully recovered. They supported their injuries to the stage to accuse, which aroused the audience's infinite anger towards the British imperialists.

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter of protest to the British government in Hong Kong. The letter of protest warned the British government in Hong Kong: "The British government in Hong Kong must immediately stop all acts of persecution against our Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, such as illegal arrests, barbaric beatings, and deportation, and revoke the illegal verdict against the Ta Kung Pao. If you are obsessed with your own ideas, ignore the solemn protest of our people, continue to implement the US imperialist policy of aggression, and antagonize the Chinese people, then you shall be responsible for all the consequences. In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, our people must persist in the struggle to the end."

Finally, the meeting also launched a thousand-yuan donation campaign to support the victims in Hong Kong.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th. Compatriots who suffered tyrannical persecution by the British government in Hong Kong angrily accused the British imperialists of their atrocities at a meeting held on the 21st by representatives of twenty-nine people's organizations in Guangdong and Guangzhou. The facts they accused powerfully exposed the shameless conspiracy of the British imperialists to intensify the persecution of our patriotic people. Qian Zaiyun, a worker at Hong Kong's Po Sing Textile Factory who was illegally arrested and deported by the British government in Hong Kong on March 1st, said: The British government in Hong Kong planned and arranged the massacre and persecution of our patriotic compatriots on March 1st. On that morning, the Tsim Sha Tsui Railway Station, along Nathan Road to the Jordan Road intersection, and the station were filled with British police and plainclothes detectives. The iron gates of the station entrance were also blocked, leaving only two entrances and exits. Two fire engines were parked next to the station pier, with one end of the canvas hose lowered into the sea. At that time, thousands upon thousands of patriotic compatriots were enthusiastically gathering at the station to welcome the "Delegation of People's Organizations from Guangdong and Guangzhou to Comfort Disaster-Stricken Compatriots in Tung Tau Village, Kowloon City." When they learned that the consolation group had postponed its arrival in Hong Kong, they were returning home in an orderly manner when a British police car suddenly drove into the crowd, and the large group of British police on the street threw tear gas, beat them with batons, and even opened fire. Subsequently, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of military police, including shield teams, long stick teams, pistol teams, as well as tanks and assault vehicles, to search pedestrians on the street and make massive arrests of Chinese workers. At about 4 p.m., I and my fellow workers Dong Xiuye, Zhou Zongjin, Wen Guanghui, and Zhou Qinyi were unreasonably arrested by the British police and put into prison cars, and were repeatedly beaten by the British police. Finally, the British government in Hong Kong sentenced us to imprisonment on various trumped-up charges and detained us for four weeks after the expiration of our sentence before deporting us. There are still some patriotic compatriots living an inhuman life in the prisons of the British government in Hong Kong.

Zhao Jiewen, a female metalworker with bandages wrapped around her head and a fractured kneecap, was helped onto the stage. She accused: "On March 1st, when I was walking home from the station to the entrance of Nanjing Street, a British police car drove towards me, suddenly violating traffic rules and crashing into the crowd. I was about to turn around to avoid it when I was knocked to the ground by the police car. At that time, a large group of British police jumped out of the police car with great momentum to arrest people, and the order was very chaotic. I struggled to get up in pain, but before I could take two steps, I vomited a lot of blood and fainted on the ground. My kneecap was shattered by the police car, and my head and waist were also injured." This brave female worker went to court with her injuries to testify when the British government in Hong Kong illegally tried the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao," exposing the conspiracy and atrocities of the British government in Hong Kong in the "March 1st" incident. Later, British detectives tried to assassinate her in a despicable manner, so she returned to Guangzhou.

After creating the "March 1st" bloody incident, the British government in Hong Kong continued to persecute our patriotic compatriots, attempting to undermine the patriotic movement of Hong Kong compatriots. In less than a month recently, the British government in Hong Kong has illegally arrested and deported a total of thirty-four Chinese residents, including many trade union directors and secretaries. Ma Hua and Huang Jinhui, staff members of the Kowloon Dock Labour Union, who took the stage to accuse, were illegally arrested by the British police in the late hours of May 14th. During their detention, they were subjected to all kinds of abuse and beatings by British police officers. After Ma Hua, Huang Jinhui, and Zhang Bai, a worker at the Huaqiang Rubber Factory, accused the British imperialists of their shameless crimes at the meeting, they all pointed out that the British government in Hong Kong has recently been instigating the so-called "free trade unions" of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to deliberately provoke disturbances, attempting to undermine the patriotic movement and anti-persecution struggle of Chinese workers. Our patriotic workers and compatriots have raised their vigilance against this and still adhere to the just struggle.

    【新华社广州二十五日电】广东省、广州市总工会筹备会等二十九个人民团体在二十一日举行大会，抗议香港英国政府迫害中国居民和非法审判大公报的暴行，并表示坚决支援大公报、文汇报、新晚报以及香港同胞为争取正当权益的斗争。参加大会的有各团体代表一千三百多人。最近被香港英国政府驱逐出境的钱在鋆、马华、黄锦辉等三十多位同胞在会上愤怒控诉英帝国主义者的凶残暴行。

    大会一致通过对香港英国政府的抗议书。抗议书警告香港英国政府说：“香港英国政府必须立即停止对香港我国同胞的非法逮捕、野蛮殴打、押解出境等一切迫害行为，撤销对大公报的非法判决。你们如果执迷不悟，漠视我国人民的严正抗议，继续执行美帝国主义的侵略政策，与中国人民为敌，则
    一切后果应由你们负责。我国人民为了保障香港我国同胞的正当权益，一定要坚持斗争到底。”
    大会最后并发起开展支援香港受害同胞的千元捐献运动。
    【新华社广州二十五日电】遭受香港英国政府横暴迫害的同胞，在广东省、广州市二十九个人民团体代表二十一日举行的大会上，愤怒地控诉了英帝国主义的暴行。他们控诉的事实有力地揭发了英帝国主义者加紧迫害我爱国人民的无耻阴谋。曾被香港英国政府三月一日非法逮捕并驱逐出境的香港宝星纱厂工人钱在鋆说：香港英国政府在三月一日有计划有布置地屠杀和迫害我爱国同胞。那天上午，尖沙咀车站沿弥敦道到佐顿道口以及车站上，都布满了英国警察和便衣密探，车站铁闸入口也封锁起来，只留两个道口出入，两辆救火车停放在车站码头旁边，帆布水喉一端已放下海里。那时，万万千千的爱国同胞正热烈地聚集在车站上准备欢迎“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团”。当他们得知慰问团展期来港的消息后有秩序地归家时，英警车突然驶向人群里乱撞，街头上的大队英警投掷催泪弹，并用警棍毒打甚至开枪射击。随后，香港英国当局又派出大队军警，包括藤牌队、长木棍队、手枪队以及坦克车、冲锋车等，在街上搜查行人并大肆逮捕中国工人。下午四时许，我和工友董修业、周宗进、文广辉、周勤义等被英警横蛮无理的捕上囚车，并遭到英警多次的毒打。最后，香港英国政府以各种莫须有的罪名，将我们判处徒刑，期满后又扣押了四个星期才递解出境。现在还有一些爱国同胞被关在香港英国政府的监狱中过着非人的生活。
    头上缠着绷带、膝盖骨也被压碎的五金女工赵洁雯，由别人扶上讲台。她控诉道：“三月一日当我从车站回家走到南京街口的时候，一辆英国警车迎面驶来，突然违反行车路线，向人丛中乱撞。我正要转身躲避便被警车撞倒地上，那时一大群英警从警车上声势汹汹地跳下来抓人，秩序非常混乱。我忍痛挣扎起来，但走不到两步便吐了很多血，昏倒在地上。我的膝盖骨被警车撞碎，头部和腰骨也撞伤了。”这位勇敢的女工，在香港英国政府非法审讯香港“大公报”时，扶伤到法庭作证，揭穿了香港英国政府“三一”事件的阴谋暴行。后来英国警探们卑鄙地企图对她加以暗害，她就回到了广州。
    香港英国政府在制造“三一”血腥事件之后，继续迫害我爱国同胞，妄图破坏香港同胞的爱国运动。在最近不到一个月的期间，香港英国政府又非法逮捕和驱逐了包括许多工会主任、书记等在内的中国居民共三十四人。登台控诉的九龙船坞劳工联合会职员马华和黄锦辉，就是在五月十四日深夜被英国警察非法逮捕的。他们在被扣押期间，曾受到英国警官的百般虐待和毒打。马华、黄锦辉和华强树胶厂工人张柏在会上控诉了英帝国主义的无耻罪行后，都指出：香港英国政府近来正在嗾使蒋匪残余组织所谓“自由工会”，专事寻衅捣乱，企图破坏中国工人的爱国运动和反迫害斗争。我爱国工人和同胞对此已提高警惕，仍坚持正义的斗争。
