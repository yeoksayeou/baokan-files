Publicist's Speech

    Continue to Strengthen the Patriotic Health Campaign
    The Patriotic Health Campaign has been launched nationwide. In many cities and villages, this campaign has already achieved great success. Many propagandists, medical workers, scientific workers, teachers, students, and activists have used various methods, even going door-to-door, to educate the masses. In some places, "everyone is moving, every household is mobilized," launching a clean-up campaign. Competitions have also been launched between groups and households. Streets, courtyards, and residences have been thoroughly cleaned, and vigorous efforts have been made to eliminate pests such as flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and lice, and to catch mice. Everyone has also paid attention to food hygiene, and everyone's clothes and bedding have been washed clean. A completely new atmosphere has emerged in these places.
    Now, the bacteriological warfare waged by American imperialism has not stopped, and summer is coming, which is a time when epidemics are likely to occur. Therefore, everyone must continue to work hard to participate in this movement, cooperate with the measures of the people's government health agencies, thoroughly defeat the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, improve the level of our country's health work step by step, gradually eliminate epidemics, and ensure everyone's health.
    The most important thing in the Patriotic Health Campaign is to emphasize cleanliness and hygiene. Because most people contract epidemics due to a lack of attention to hygiene. For example, drinking raw water; eating food that has been crawled on by flies and other pests carrying germs and viruses, or food that has not been cooked thoroughly or has spoiled; or being bitten by mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and other insects carrying pathogens; or coming into contact with things carrying germs and viruses, etc. American imperialism is spreading poisonous insects and objects, also wanting to use these things to spread germs and viruses, making us sick. If we do a good job in cleaning and hygiene: clearing garbage and dirty water inside and outside our homes; preventing mosquitoes and flies from breeding; cleaning every corner of the house, preventing fleas from hiding; bathing and changing clothes frequently, eliminating lice, bedbugs, etc.; catching mice; not drinking raw water, not eating raw, cold, spoiled, or unclean food: we can cut off the path of bacteria spreading to people, and we will not get sick or get sick less often, protecting our health. American imperialism's bacteriological warfare will also be easily defeated by us.
    When doing these tasks, everyone should pay attention to the following points:
    First, we must think of various specific methods based on the actual conditions of each place and the existing conditions of each household. For example, in cities and towns with large populations, we must first do a good job in environmental sanitation. Many rural people have always drunk cold water, and we must first persuade everyone to change this bad habit. If there are stagnant pools of water in some places, breeding mosquitoes, everyone should think of various ways to change this situation. Dredge where possible, fill in where possible; if conditions permit, DDT, 666, lime, kerosene, etc. can also be used for disinfection. Some families have many bedbugs, which are difficult to eradicate, and we must be determined to remove them. Sprinkle DDT, scald with boiling water, and seal the cracks in the walls and floors. If it doesn't work once, do it again after a few days. If one family cannot eradicate them, several families should work together at the same time. Mosquitoes are difficult to eliminate completely in rural areas, so everyone should use possible conditions to install screens, set up mosquito nets, use mosquito coils for fumigation, or other methods to prevent mosquito bites. Everyone should use their wisdom, think of various methods, and pay attention to exchanging experiences. As long as everyone uses their hands and brains, cleaning and hygiene work can definitely be done well. The volunteers on the Korean front line were able to build iron factories from scratch, and were able to use hand grenades to destroy enemy tanks in groups. Don't we have a way to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene?
    Second, hygiene work must be done universally and thoroughly. In the past, when some places carried out hygiene work, such situations often occurred: this family moved, that family didn't move; the citizens did well, but some agencies and schools didn't pay attention; the streets and courtyards were cleaned, but the rooms were very dirty; the adults' clothes were washed clean, but the children were still dirty. This time, everyone must persuade and mobilize everyone to participate in this movement; and the work in every corner must be done well. In particular, we must be determined to do a good job in those places where hygiene work is most difficult to do well. For example, in a family, the kitchen and toilet are the easiest to get dirty, but these two places are the most important for the health of the whole family, so everyone must clean the kitchen and toilet. In many rural areas, kitchens, toilets, and livestock pens are often connected together, and we should think of ways to change this situation. Some rural areas do not have the habit of building toilets, which is both unsanitary and wastes a lot of fertilizer, so we should promote building toilets in every household. In some places, latrines are open-air, or the covers are not tight, which easily breeds flies. Everyone should try to cover the latrines well to prevent them from breeding maggots. In some rural areas, livestock pens are full of manure and grass, which is harmful to both humans and animals, so we should think of ways to improve them according to local conditions. In cities, the most important things to pay attention to are restaurants, vendors, slaughterhouses, vegetable markets, public toilets, etc. These places are related to the health of the broad masses of the people, and hygiene and cleaning work is relatively difficult to do well, so everyone must work hard and cooperate with the government to strengthen management in order to do it well.
    We must persuade everyone to understand that epidemic prevention and hygiene is a social work, and one person's failure to do well will implicate everyone. Therefore, everyone must work together. The attitude of "each person sweeps the snow in front of their own door" is not right; the attitude of "my lack of hygiene has nothing to do with you" is even more wrong.
    Third, we must persevere and develop the habit of always paying attention to cleanliness and hygiene. Now, in order to launch the Patriotic Health Campaign, everyone must carry out a blitz of cleaning and hygiene work. After the blitz, the most important thing is to maintain cleanliness regularly. To achieve this, on the one hand, we must recognize the importance of this work, and everyone should consciously pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene regularly;
    On the other hand, every place must establish a health work system through everyone's discussion, formulate work plans in units where many people live, work, and work together, stipulate specific methods, incorporate this work into the patriotic covenant, or formulate a separate patriotic health covenant, and mobilize everyone to compete with each other. Various health organizations should conduct regular and surprise inspections. Various health groups should also inspect each other. After the inspection, public praise and criticism should be carried out through blackboards, radio stations, etc. In this way, everyone can supervise each other, and we can ensure that cleaning and hygiene work becomes a regular task. This is very important for everyone's health and the country's construction.

### 继续加强爱国防疫卫生运动

专栏：宣传员讲话

    继续加强爱国防疫卫生运动
    爱国防疫卫生运动在全国范围内开展起来了。在许多城市和农村里，这个运动已经有了很大的成绩。许多宣传员、医务工作者、科学工作者、教员、学生和积极分子，采取了各种方式甚至挨门逐户向群众进行了宣传。有的地方“人人动手、户户动员”，展开了清洁卫生工作。组与组、户与户之间还展开了竞赛。街道、庭院和住室都进行了彻底清扫，并大力消灭苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤、虱子等害虫和捕捉老鼠。大家对饮食卫生也注意起来了，每个人的衣服被褥都拆洗得干干净净。这些地方，出现了一片崭新的气象。
    现在，美帝国主义进行的细菌战还没有停止，夏天又到来了，正是容易发生疫病的时候。所以大家必须继续努力参加这个运动，配合人民政府卫生机关的措施，把美帝国主义的细菌战彻底打败，把我们国家的卫生工作水平一步一步提高，逐渐消灭流行病，保证人人健康。
    爱国防疫卫生运动，最重要的事就是讲求清洁卫生。因为人们染上疫病，大多数是由于不注意卫生所致。例如喝生水；吃了带有病菌、病毒的蝇子和其他害虫爬过的食物以及没有煮熟或者腐败了的食物；或者是被带有病原体的蚊子、跳蚤、虱子等咬了；或者是接触了带有病菌病毒的东西等等。美帝国主义撒下毒虫毒物，也是想利用这些东西把病菌病毒传播开来，使我们生病的。如果我们把清洁卫生工作做好：清除住宅内外的垃圾、脏水；不让蚊子、苍蝇生长；把屋子的每个角落都弄干净，不让它潜藏跳蚤；勤洗澡、勤换衣服，把虱子、臭虫等消灭掉；捕灭老鼠；不喝生水、不吃生冷或腐败了的或不干净的东西：我们就能切断细菌传到人身上的路子，就会不生病或少生病，保护自己的健康。美帝国主义的细菌战，也就容易被我们打败。
    大家在做这些工作的时候，要注意下面几点：
    第一，要根据各个地方的实际情况和各家各户的现有条件，多想各种具体办法来做。比如，城市、集镇人口多的地方，首先就要搞好环境卫生。许多农村的人素来喝冷水，首先就要说服大家改掉这个不好习惯。有的地方有积水坑，孳生蚊子，大家就应该想各种办法改变这种情形。能疏通的疏通，能填平的填平；如果有条件，还可以使用滴滴涕、六六六、石灰、煤油等实行消毒。有的家庭臭虫很多，很难除净，我们要下决心去除掉它们。洒滴滴涕，用开水烫，把墙壁地板的缝隙糊死。一次不行，隔几天再搞一次。一家不能把它除尽，联合几家同时做。农村里蚊子很难除尽，大家要利用可能的条件，尽量装纱窗、置蚊帐、用蚊烟香来薰或其他办法，不让蚊子咬。大家要发挥智慧，多想各种各样的办法，并且注意交流经验。只要大家动手动脑，清洁卫生工作是一定能够做好的。志愿军在朝鲜前线能够空手建立一座一座的铁工厂，能够用手榴弹消灭敌人成群的坦克，难道我们没有办法把清洁卫生工作做好吗？
    第二，卫生工作要做得普遍、彻底。过去，有的地方开展卫生工作时，时常发生这样的情况：这家动，那家不动；市民做好了，某些机关学校却不注意；街道院子弄干净了，屋子里却很脏；大人的穿戴洗干净了，小孩子还是很脏。这次，大家要说服、动员所有的人，都参加这个运动；而且要把每个角落的工作都做好。特别要有决心搞好那些卫生工作最不容易搞好的地方。比如，在一个家庭里，最容易脏的是厨房和厕所，而这两个地方却是关系一家人健康最要紧的地方，所以大家一定要把厨房、厕所弄干净。在许多农村里，厨房、厕所、牲口圈常常连在一块，应该想办法改变这种情况。有的农村没有建立厕所的习惯，既不卫生，也损失许多肥料，应该提倡户户建厕所。有的地方茅坑是露天的，或者封盖不严，容易长苍蝇。大家要尽量把茅坑盖好，不让它生蛆。有的农村牲口圈里满是粪草，对人畜都有害，就要根据各地情况想法改进。在城市里，最要注意的是饮食店、摊贩、屠宰场、菜市场、公共厕所等。这些地方关系到广大人民的健康，而且卫生清洁工作比较难搞，必须大家努力，配合政府加强管理，才能搞好。
    我们要说服所有的人，使大家明白防疫卫生是一件社会工作，一个人不搞好就要连累大家。所以必须大家同心协力来做。“各人自扫门前雪”的态度是不对的；“我不讲卫生与你没关系”的态度更是不对的。
    第三，要坚持下去，养成经常注意清洁卫生的习惯。现在为了把爱国防疫卫生运动开展起来，大家都要突击清洁卫生工作。突击之后，最要紧的是要经常保持清洁。要做到这一点，我们一方面要认识这个工作的重要意义，大家自觉地经常注意清洁卫生；
    一方面，每个地方都要经过大家讨论，建立卫生工作制度，在许多人共同生活、共同劳动、共同工作的单位里订出工作计划，规定具体办法，把这项工作订入爱国公约里面，或者另订爱国防疫卫生公约，并发动大家互相竞赛。各个卫生组织要举行定期的和突击的检查。各个卫生小组也要互相检查。检查之后，要通过黑板报、广播台等进行公开的表扬和批评。这样，大家互相督促，就能保证把清洁卫生工作变成经常的工作。这对每个人的健康和国家的建设都是很重要的。
