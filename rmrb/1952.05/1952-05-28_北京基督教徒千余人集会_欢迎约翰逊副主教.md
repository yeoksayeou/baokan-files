Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The Beijing Christian Organizations' Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a meeting at the Asbury Church on the afternoon of the 25th to welcome Deputy Archbishop Johnson of Canterbury, England, and his wife, who are visiting our country. Mr. Day, a lecturer on labor education issues from Oxford University in England, who came to China with Deputy Archbishop Johnson, was also invited to attend. More than a thousand Christians from the capital attended the meeting. After hymns and prayers, Reverend Wang Zizhong, Chairman of the Beijing Christian Organizations' Committee for the Defense of World Peace, delivered a welcoming speech. Then, Deputy Archbishop Johnson delivered a speech amidst warm applause, saying that he was deeply moved to be able to come to China, which has undergone great changes, and attend this Christian meeting. Johnson then explained the importance of the cause of world peace from the perspective of a Christian. He also introduced the Soviet Union's peace policy and its achievements in communist peace-building. When he talked about the great economic difficulties that the British government's policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war has brought to the British people, he emphasized: Today, the vast majority of the British people and Christians demand peace. The British working people believe that the government's foreign policy must be changed, the Korean War must be stopped, a five-power peace pact must be concluded, the arms race must be stopped, and trade relations between Britain and China and Britain and the Soviet Union must be developed. Now, the voice of the British people is getting louder and louder, and this voice has made it possible for me to come to China to visit and bring the message of peace from the British people and Christians to the Chinese people. Johnson finally stated that when he returns home in the future, he will definitely bring back the situation of the new China and the peaceful aspirations of the Chinese people to the British people. Johnson's speech won warm applause from the audience.
    Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Day also delivered speeches at the meeting, expressing their respect to the people and women of New China.
