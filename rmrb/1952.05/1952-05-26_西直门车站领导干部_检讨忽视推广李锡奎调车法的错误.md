Column: Responses to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of People's Daily

To the Editor:
    The People's Daily published a letter from reader Zhang Liande on April 11, criticizing the phenomenon of our station's leadership not paying enough attention to promoting the Li Xikui shunting method. This criticism is very correct and very helpful to us. After Zhang Liande returned from Fengtai from learning the Li Xikui shunting method, he proposed a learning plan to us. We emphasized that there was no time during the "Three-Anti" campaign and emphasized that there were no instructions from higher authorities, so we did not learn the Li Xikui shunting method as scheduled on March 1. On March 2, the higher authorities instructed us to start learning on March 1. We held a meeting on the 4th to discuss and formulate a learning plan and established a promotion committee. In the promotion committee, we did not include shunters who had returned from Fengtai to study, which was wrong. We did not start leading the trainees to learn the Li Xikui shunting method until March 6. This shows that our leading cadres do not pay attention to promoting advanced experience and have serious bureaucratic work styles. We have already reviewed this matter and held a general test of the Li Xikui shunting method in April, and mobilized the transportation teams to visit each other. We also held a summary meeting on the Li Xikui shunting method to summarize experience. These measures have improved the shunting work of the entire station.

    西直门车站领导干部
    检讨忽视推广李锡奎调车法的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报四月十一日发表了读者张连德的来信，对我站领导方面不重视推广李锡奎调车法的现象提出批评。这个批评是很正确的，对我们有很大的帮助。张连德同志从丰台学习李锡奎调车法回来后，向我们提出了学习计划。我们强调在“三反”运动时没有时间，并强调上级没有指示，以致没有在三月一日如期学习李锡奎调车法。三月二日，上级指示我们在三月一日开始学习，我们在四日开会讨论，订出学习计划，成立了推行委员会。在推行委员会中，我们没有吸收从丰台学习回来的调车员参加，这是不对的。我们直到三月六日才开始领导学员学习李锡奎调车法。这都说明我们领导干部不重视推行先进经验，有严重的官僚主义作风。我们对这件事已经作了检讨，并在四月份举行了李锡奎调车法的普遍测验，发动运转班互相参观。我们并召开了李锡奎调车法的总结大会，总结经验。这些措施使全站调车工作提高了一步。
    西直门站站长  张五宪
