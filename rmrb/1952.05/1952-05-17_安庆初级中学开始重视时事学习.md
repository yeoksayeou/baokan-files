    Anqing Junior High School Begins to Emphasize Current Affairs Learning
    Comrade Editor: Anqing Junior High School in northern Anhui recently held a current affairs test. Among the 388 students who took the test, more than 370 failed, with the average score for the entire school being less than 31 points. In the answers, many students still did not know that the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council had held a meeting in Oslo, that Guo Moruo had made a report at this meeting protesting the use of bacteriological weapons by the United States, or that the great water conservancy project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River—the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project—had already begun.
    The results of this test have attracted the attention of the school leadership. They have strengthened the students' current affairs learning. For example, they have mobilized students to subscribe to current affairs manuals, established necessary systems to implement tests and hold symposiums to assist current affairs learning, and strengthened the leadership of the reading groups.
    The phenomenon of middle school students neglecting current affairs learning may also exist in schools in other places, especially in remote areas and schools with weak political leadership. This situation may be even more serious. Therefore, I suggest that all schools conduct an inspection to correct this phenomenon in a timely manner.

    安庆初级中学开始重视时事学习
    编辑同志：皖北安庆初级中学校最近举行了一次时事测验。参加测验的三百八十八个学生当中，不及格的就有三百七十多人，全校每人平均分数不到三十一分。在答案中，许多学生至今还不知道世界和平理事会执行局在奥斯陆举行过会议，不知道郭沫若在这个会议上作了关于抗议美国使用细菌武器的报告，不知道长江中游已经开始了的伟大水利建设——荆江分洪工程。
    经过这次测验的结果，引起了学校领导方面的注意。他们已经加强了同学们的时事学习。例如，发动同学们订时事手册，建立了实行测验和举行座谈会等辅助时事学习的必要制度，也加强了对读报组的领导。
    中学生忽视时事学习的现象，在其他地方的学校中也可能存在着，特别是在边远地区和政治领导薄    弱的学校，这种情况可能更加严重，因此我建议各校都作一次检查，以便及时纠正这种现象。
