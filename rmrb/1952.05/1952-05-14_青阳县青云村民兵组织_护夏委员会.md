    Qingyang County Qingyun Village Militia Organizes "Protect Summer Committee"
    The entire militia of Qingyun Village in Qingyang County, southern Anhui, established a "Protect Summer Committee" to protect seedlings and crops. They divided the entire village militia into four teams, each responsible for the summer protection work of two *lv*. Each team sends two people to patrol and stand guard every night. The patrolling militia report on the inspection situation once a day. The work of each team is checked by the village armed forces cadre every three days. The summer protection period is set for fifty days. At the end of the summer protection period, a commendation and award ceremony will be held. The militia comrades realize that striving to protect increased production achievements is a concrete manifestation of patriotism, and they are determined and confident to do a good job in summer protection.

    青阳县青云村民兵组织“护夏委员会”
    皖南青阳县青云村全体民兵，为了保护秧苗和庄稼，成立了“护夏委员会”。他们把全村民兵分为四班，每班负责两个闾的护夏工作。每夜每班派出二人流动放哨。放哨民兵每天汇报一次巡查情况。各班工作情况，由村武装干部三天抽查一次。护夏期限定为五十天。护夏期满时，将举行一次评模发奖大会。民兵同志们认识到，努力保护增产成绩就是爱国的具体表现，他们有决心、有信心做好护夏工作。
