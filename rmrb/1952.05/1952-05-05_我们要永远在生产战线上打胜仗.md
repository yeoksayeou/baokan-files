We Must Always Win on the Production Front
Industrial Labor Model, Leader of the "Ma Hengchang Group," Dong Zhenyuan

The working brothers across the country are encouraging us and caring for us. We must not fail the expectations of the working brothers across the country. We must always maintain the glory of the "Ma Hengchang Group."

Last year, our group responded to Chairman Gao Gang's call and increased production and saved 366 tons of grain in five months. This year, we guarantee to increase production and save 800 tons of grain. Can we achieve this guarantee? I think: we certainly can! Because after the "Three-Anti" struggle, our enthusiasm is even greater. We realize that to increase production and save more, we must master the technology skillfully, use our brains, and find more tricks. Therefore, our whole group launched a "find tricks" campaign. For example, every time worker Liu Ruimin receives a task, he carefully considers how to improve efficiency. He feels: "You can't fall behind others in anything you do." He reduced the working hours for each job by half, but he still felt it was "not enough." Now he is studying multi-tool and multi-blade technology, determined to reduce working hours further. Two years ago, he was an apprentice, but this year he has become a highly skilled technician in the whole factory. Old worker Wang Zhanxue boldly used multi-tool and multi-blade technology when making the main shaft of the 1028 indexing machine, increasing efficiency by more than three times. Everyone learns technology from him, but he humbly says: "My technology is not good enough, I still have to study hard." During the "Three-Anti" movement, worker Zhao Diankui established the virtue of cherishing the property of the motherland. Seeing that using steel materials always wasted some, he thought: "We, the working class, should find ways to save raw materials." So he studied ways to waste less steel materials. Once, he used a "nesting method" to save 150 kilograms of steel material. Xia Jiuxiang and Guo Hongen, when making lead screws, became "skilled through practice" because they had been doing it for a long time. They voluntarily requested from the administrative cadres: "The quota working hours for each lead screw is 30 hours, which is too wide, it only takes 22 hours." The administrative cadres agreed to their request. They also discussed together and changed the cutting process, and as a result, it took only twelve and a half hours to complete a lead screw. We know that as long as we use our brains, we can constantly break through production standards and produce more finished products.

The motherland is leaping forward, and I feel that our responsibility is great. The more we produce, the faster the process of the motherland's industrialization. The comrades of the Ma Hengchang Group all have a slogan: "We must always win on the production front." Recently, our whole factory has launched a "Peace Dove" production competition. Our group did not produce a single defective product, and 22 people exceeded the completion of the task by 50% to 100%, and received 22 "Peace Doves." We know that improving production increases the power of peace.

I participated in the "May Day" Labor Day observation ceremony in Beijing, saw Chairman Mao, and saw that the strength of our working people is even stronger. I am determined to work harder when I return to the factory to meet the upcoming new high tide of economic construction. (Picture attached)

### 我们要永远在生产战线上打胜仗

    我们要永远在生产战线上打胜仗
    工业劳动模范  “马恒昌小组”组长  董振远
    全国工人兄弟鼓舞着我们，爱护着我们。我们决不能辜负全国工人兄弟的期望，我们要永远保持“马恒昌小组”的光荣。
    去年我们小组响应高岗主席的号召，在五个月内增产节约了三百六十六吨粮食；今年我们保证要增产节约八百吨粮食。我们能够实现这个保证吗？我认为：我们一定能够！因为经过“三反”斗争，我们的劲头更足了。我们认识到：要想多增产节约，就必须熟练地掌握技术，开动脑筋，多找窍门。因此，我们全组同志曾掀起了“找窍门”的运动。比如工友刘瑞民每次接到一个任务，都要仔细捉摸怎样提高效率，他觉得：“干样样事情，都不能落在人后面。”他把每一件活的工时，都减少了一半，但他还感到“不够劲”。现在他正在钻研多刀多刃的技术，决心要把工时减少。前年他是个徒工，今年他已成了全厂技术高明的技术工人了。老工友王占学大胆地运用多刀多刃，做一○二八分盘机主轴时，效率提高了三倍多。大家向他学习技术，他却虚心地说：“我的技术还不够好，我还要加紧学习。”工友赵殿魁在“三反”运动中树立了爱护祖国财产的美德，他看见利用钢料，总要浪费一些，他就想：“咱们工人阶级应该想办法节省原料。”他便研究怎样少浪费钢料的办法。有一次，他采用了一种“套料法”，把钢料节省了一百五十斤。夏久香和郭洪恩做导丝杠，因为做久了，“熟能生巧”，他们就向行政干部自动要求：“每个导丝杠的定额工时是三十小时，太宽了，只要二十二小时就可以啦。”行政干部答应了他们的要求。他们又共同商量，改变了吃刀的工序，结果用了十二个半小时完成了一个导丝杠。我们知道：只要多动脑筋，就能不断突破生产标准，就能多生产成品。
    祖国在飞跃地前进，我感到我们的责任很大。我们多生产，就是加快祖国工业化的进程。马恒昌小组同志们都有一句口号：“我们要永远地在生产战线上打胜仗。”最近我们全厂掀起了“和平鸽”生产竞赛，我们小组没有出一件废品，有二十二个人超过完成任务百分之五十到百分之百，得到了二十二个“和平鸽”。我们知道，提高了生产，就是增加了和平的力量。
    我参加了北京“五一”劳动节的观礼，看见了毛主席，看见了我们劳动人民的力量更加强大了。我决心回到工厂时更加紧生产，迎接即将到来的经济建设的新高潮。（附图片）
