Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: As the U.S. government uses all kinds of vile and shameless means to try to quibble and deny its heinous crime of conducting germ warfare in Korea and China, two U.S. Air Force personnel captured by our Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea have provided undeniable evidence of personally dropping germ bombs, regarding the U.S. government's planned, large-scale use of bacteriological weapons in Korea to massacre peaceful Korean people and Korean-Chinese soldiers.

On the night of January 13th, at 11 p.m., our army shot down a U.S. B-26 type aircraft, No. 600, in Anju. There were four U.S. Air Force personnel in the plane, two of whom – Sergeant Cambell, the mechanic, and Lieutenant Downes, the bombardier – were killed when the plane was shot down. The other two parachuted and were captured by our Volunteer Army near Sunan.

The captured U.S. Air Force personnel were Lieutenant Kenneth L. Enoch, service number AO2069988, navigator, and Lieutenant John S. Quinn, service number 17993A, pilot, both belonging to the 8th Bombardment Squadron, 3rd Bombardment Group, 3rd Bombardment Wing, of the U.S. Fifth Air Force.

According to Enoch's confession: on August 25th of last year, he and ten other pilots and fifteen navigators attended a secret lecture on bacteriological weapons. On January 7th of this year, he dropped two germ bombs in Hwangju, North Korea, and on January 11th, he dropped four germ bombs in the west of Junghwa. Quinn listened to a course on germ warfare in mid-December of last year. On January 4th of this year, he dropped four germ bombs south of Pyongyang, and on January 11th, he dropped two germ bombs northeast of Kunu-ri.

They have confessed to these crimes without reservation, and have already submitted detailed confessions to the Korean-Chinese People's Army authorities. The confessions of these two prisoners reveal the fact that the U.S. government had long intended to carry out germ warfare in Korea and had made sufficient preparations for it. At least as early as August of last year, the U.S. aggressors had been conducting training in germ warfare in the U.S. Air Force, and anticipated that the result of germ warfare in North Korea might involve South Korea, and therefore regularly held courses on bacteriological defense in the troops, and injected troops with "vaccines that cannot be made public due to military secrets" to prevent their own troops from being infected by the germs and viruses they had personally spread.

At the same time, the two prisoners confessed that the U.S. military began conducting germ warfare in Korea on January 1st of this year. In order to prevent more people in their own troops from knowing the truth, they stipulated that germ bombs should be referred to as "non-explosive bombs" in reports. However, the fact that the U.S. aggressors are using a large number of weapons of human destruction within the borders of Korea and China is irrefutable, and can never be concealed from the people of the world with sleight of hand. We want to warn the U.S. government that its crimes have aroused the indignation of all conscientious people in the world. This indignation has been transformed into firm and powerful forces. If the U.S. aggressors do not stop these atrocities, they will surely be subjected to a just trial by the people of the world.

    被俘获的两名美国空军人员
    供认侵朝美军进行细菌战
    美国政府的罪行已激起全世界人民的公愤
    【新华社五日讯】正当美国政府使用各种卑鄙无耻的手段企图狡辩抵赖它在朝鲜与中国所进行的细菌战的滔天罪行时，我朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜所俘获的两名美国空军人员，对美国政府在朝鲜有计划地大规模地使用细菌武器以虐杀朝鲜和平人民及朝中士兵的罪行，提供了不可争辩的亲身投掷细菌弹的证据。一月十三日夜十一时我军在安州击落美军Ｂ—26型第六○○号飞机一架。飞机中的美国空军人员四名，其中二名：机械师坎拜尔中士及轰炸手唐内士中尉在飞机被击落时毙命，另二名跳降落伞在顺安附近被我志愿军俘获。被俘的美空军人员为中尉领航员凯尼斯·伊纳克军号AO二○六九九八八与中尉驾驶员约翰·奎恩军号一七九九三A，同属美第五航空队第三轰炸联队第三轰炸大队第八轰炸中队。据伊纳克供称：他曾于去年八月二十五日与其他十名驾驶员、十五名领航员一道听了细菌武器的秘密讲授课程。于今年一月七日在北朝鲜黄州投掷细菌弹两枚，于一月十一日在中和城西沿投掷细菌弹四枚。奎恩则于去年十二月中旬听过细菌战课程。于今年一月四日在平壤南边投掷细菌弹四枚，一月十一日在军隅里东北投掷细菌弹两枚。他们对于这些罪行已经供认不讳，而且已经详细地写成自白书交与朝中人民军队当局。从该两俘的自白书中，暴露出美国政府早已蓄意在朝鲜进行细菌战的事实，并为此作了足够的准备。至少远在去年八月，美国侵略者即在美空军中进行细菌战的训练，并预料在北朝鲜进行细菌战的结果将有可能牵连到南朝鲜，因此又在部队中经常举行防御细菌的课程讲授，对部队注射“因军事秘密而不能公开的疫苗”，以预防自己部队感染了自己亲手撒布的病菌与病毒。同时，该两俘虏供称：美军于今年一月一日开始在朝鲜进行细菌战。为了不使他自己部队内有更多的人知道真情，并规定在汇报中将细菌弹改称“不爆炸的炸弹”。但是美国侵略者在朝中境内使用大量毁灭人类的武器的事实已铁证如山，绝不是用障眼法就可以蒙蔽世界人民的。我们要警告美国政府，它的罪行已激起世界上一切有良心人们的公愤。这种公愤已化为坚决与强大力量，假若美国侵略者不停止这种暴行，它必将受到全世界人民的正义的裁判。
