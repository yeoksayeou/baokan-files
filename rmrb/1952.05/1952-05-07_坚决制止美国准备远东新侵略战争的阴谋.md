    Our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Enlai, representing the Central People's Government, issued a statement on the 5th, denouncing the U.S. government's arbitrary announcement that the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan had come into effect, the illegal announcement of the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission, and the instruction for the so-called Japan-Chiang "peace treaty" to "come into effect" simultaneously with the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan—a series of illegal actions that violate all international agreements concerning postwar Japan. He also called on the people of the whole country and the people of Asia to unite and stop the crisis of war created by the United States in the Far East. We firmly support this statement by our government.
    Since the Allied occupation of Japan began in 1945, two different and diametrically opposed policies have emerged among the Allied countries of World War II in dealing with the issue of defeated Japan: one is to implement the democratization of Japan, eliminate Japanese militarism, conclude a genuine peace treaty with Japan with the participation of all relevant countries, and withdraw all foreign occupying forces to ensure that Japan becomes an independent, free, democratic, and peaceful country. This policy is one of peace and democracy. It is embodied in the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, the Yalta Agreement, the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission, and the United Nations Declaration of January 1,1942, which is wholeheartedly advocated by the world peace camp led by the Soviet Union and resolutely fought for its realization. The other policy, which is diametrically opposed to this, is to restore Japan's fascism, revive Japanese militarism, and forcibly create a separate peace treaty with Japan that excludes China and the Soviet Union in order to prolong the U.S. occupation of Japan, so as to reduce Japan to a U.S. dependency and a military bridgehead in the Far East. This policy is one of aggression and war preparation. It violates all solemn agreements concerning Japan in all international agreements and is resolutely advocated and thoroughly implemented by the imperialist war camp led by the United States. China has consistently stood on the side of the policy of peace and democracy, adhered to all international agreements concerning Japan, advocated the realization of Japan's democratization, prevented Japan from becoming an aggressor again, the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty with Japan with the participation of all relevant countries, and the withdrawal of all foreign occupying forces from Japan. The successive statements of our Minister of Foreign Affairs have demonstrated the firm and unshakable position of the entire people of the People's Republic of China on this issue. The U.S. imperialists' series of illegal acts and provocations in violating all international agreements and adhering to the policy of aggression and war preparation on the question of Japan can only arouse the unanimous anger and serious vigilance of our 475 million people. The entire Chinese people will fight to the end to smash this U.S. policy of aggression and war preparation.
    The United States, using its authority in the Allied Headquarters in Japan, has consistently taken various steps and measures throughout the occupation of Japan to undermine all international agreements in which it personally participated, in order to realize its policy of aggression and war preparation. This policy has been pursued even more frantically, especially after the U.S.-launched war of aggression against Korea was defeated by the Chinese and Korean people. According to the 62nd issue of the Japanese magazine "Zen'ei" published in October last year, the number of air force bases already established by the United States in Japan, including Yokota, Misawa, Itazuke, and Kanoya, is more than fifty, and new air force bases are still being built. The naval ports used by Japan for aggressive wars before the war, such as Yokosuka, Sasebo, Kure, and Maizuru, have all been repaired and strengthened, becoming U.S. naval bases in Japan. Under U.S. direction, its lackey, the Yoshida government, plans to expand the already established police reserve force of 75,000, which is equivalent to an army, to 250,000, and equip them with weapons with greater firepower than the Japanese infantry regiments of the past. In terms of the navy, under U.S. instigation, the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency already has 300 ships, including minesweepers that have participated in the Korean War, and recently plans to add 308 ships, totaling 250,000 tons. In Japan, military-related industrial sectors and transportation and communication sectors, such as steel, petroleum, chemicals, electricity, railways, and telecommunications, are all controlled by U.S. public and private capital. According to figures released by the Foreign Investment Committee of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the total amount of capital invested in Japan by the U.S. government and U.S. private individuals in various forms has reached 320 billion yen. This official Japanese figure is of course not accurate, but it can also be seen the extent to which the United States has transformed Japanese industry into an appendage of the U.S. military industry. These facts clearly indicate that in the past six years and eight months, especially after its war of aggression against Korea was defeated, the United States has been actively arming Japan, turning the entire Japan into a military base for its new war of aggression in the Far East, which it dreams of day and night.
    The U.S. government attempts to use the Japanese base, which it has armed, as the central link in a series of arrangements in Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. Around Japan, the United States has carried out and is carrying out a series of aggressive measures. It has already concluded the "U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Philippines, and the "ANZUS Security Treaty" with Australia and New Zealand. In January of this year, it further gathered the United Kingdom and France in Washington for a secret meeting of chiefs of staff to conspire plans to expand aggressive actions in Southeast Asia. At the same time, it forced its Japanese lackey, the Yoshida government, to conclude a so-called "peace treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan. For a long time, the U.S. imperialists have妄想(妄想: cherishing a delusion)ed to take Japan as a center, to connect this series of aggressive organizations, actions, and conspiracies, and to create a Pacific aggressive organization similar to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under complete U.S. control.
    The purpose of all these actions and conspiracies of the United States is only one: to turn Japan into the center and bridgehead of a Far Eastern military aggression network, to prepare for a new Far Eastern war of aggression to encircle the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. And in order to achieve this goal, a necessary step is to resolutely announce the entry into force of the separate peace treaty with Japan illegally signed in San Francisco and the so-called U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and Administrative Agreement, illegally announce the dissolution of the Far Eastern Commission, and at the same time instruct the so-called Japan-Chiang "peace treaty" to "come into effect" on the basis of the illegal separate treaty. However, this series of planned and frantic actions by the U.S. government in disregarding international agreements and deliberately making itself an enemy of the Chinese and Soviet peoples cannot frighten the Chinese people who have overthrown the Kuomintang reactionary rule fully supported by U.S. imperialism and defeated U.S. imperialism together with the Korean people in the Korean War. The Chinese people firmly believe that they have the greatest determination to stop the U.S. imperialists' new aggressive conspiracy in the Far East and will not stop until they achieve their goal. Moreover, under the circumstances that the state of war between China and Japan still continues, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which was concluded two years ago under the direct guidance of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin and has great historical foresight, has its obvious significance today. The closer unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples will certainly be able to stop the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to destroy peace in the Far East.
    We know that this series of illegal actions by the United States is a sinful act that completely violates the will and interests of the Japanese people. The Japanese people demand true democratic rights, but the U.S. imperialists have consistently and madly deprived the Japanese people of their democratic rights, and recently instructed their lackey, the Yoshida government, to propose the so-called "Subversive Activities Prevention Bill" as a preparation for carrying out general suppression of the Japanese people after the illegal separate peace treaty comes into effect, in order to prohibit and restrict the Japanese people's rights to fight for Japan's national independence and freedom, to protect their basic human rights, and to improve their living conditions. On the other hand, it ordered the Yoshida government to arbitrarily and illegally release a large number of war criminals sentenced by the Far East International Military Tribunal, the deadly enemies of the Japanese people, and to date, a total of 7,233 people have been released from purging. The U.S. imperialists are vigorously restoring Japan's police rule. It has been doing everything it can to assist and encourage Japanese fascist groups and individuals to resume their activities in order to lead Japan back to the path of fascism. The illegal separate peace treaty, the so-called security treaty, and the administrative agreement that the United States has declared effective in order to bind the entire Japan to its war machine will undoubtedly further intensify the attack on the democratic rights of the Japanese people and further accelerate the process of Japan's complete fascistization under U.S. rule. Under the heavy pressure of these so-called peace treaties, treaties, and agreements, the living standards of the Japanese people will inevitably decline further, and the suffering of the Japanese people will only deepen.
    The U.S. imperialists know very well that these treaties and so on are not popular with the Japanese people, so they have mobilized large and small public and private propaganda machines and desperately used a lot of so-called "independence," "autonomy," and "complete sovereignty" to dress up Japan, which is chained by these treaties and agreements, as if it were a sovereign country not subject to any foreign control. Of course, this is not the case. The Chinese people today, three years after liberation, still deeply remember the tragic position of the old China under the control of the U.S. lackey Chiang Kai-shek, and we can imagine the humiliation and suffering of the Japanese people today. We can see that under the chains of these treaties and agreements, Japan's airspace has become U.S. airspace, Japan's territorial waters have become U.S. territorial waters, and Japan's territory can be arbitrarily controlled by the United States. The entire Japan will embark on the path of following U.S. orders and carrying out aggressive wars for the United States, which will lead to Japan's destruction again. Japan's legal rights are arbitrarily destroyed and divided by the U.S. occupiers. Japanese real estate and land are arbitrarily occupied by the U.S. occupiers. The movement, residence, and actions of the Japanese people are subject to U.S. orders. We can see that the peaceful people of Japan will be sent abroad to carry out aggressive wars for the huge profits of U.S. monopoly capital, and will die for this. Japanese intellectuals will see their country's entire cultural life being invaded by U.S. war clamor and obscene yellow publications, and their freedom of speech will fall under the bayonets of the U.S. lackey Yoshida government. Japanese national capitalists and small and medium-sized merchants will be unable to raise their heads due to the dumping of U.S. goods and the U.S. blockade and embargo policy. Under the shackles of the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan and the so-called security treaty and administrative agreement, Japan will in fact become only the 49th state of the United States.
    The brave and self-respecting Japanese people have long seen through the true meaning of these traitorous treaties imposed on Japan by the United States. They know that these traitorous treaties will lead their country and themselves into the abyss of destruction. They have been and are waging a persistent and unyielding resolute struggle against various oppressions by the United States, especially against the signing of these traitorous treaties and the Yoshida government, which is directed by the United States, severely hitting the U.S. occupiers and their lackey Yoshida government, and making great contributions to the movement for peace in the Far East. The Chinese people, who have emerged victorious from the same oppression by U.S. imperialism and the same struggle, are filled with sincere respect and warm sympathy and support for the Japanese people's solemn and courageous great struggle for independence, freedom, democracy, and peace. From our own experience, we firmly believe that the Japanese people's great struggle will surely achieve final victory.
    Now, the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which were entirely planned by the U.S. imperialists, have been arrogantly declared effective by the United States. The entire Japan, from the sky to the seabed, has become a part of the U.S. aggressive military apparatus—a military bridgehead in the Far East. The sinister shadow of a new Far Eastern war of aggression is looming over every country and every family in peaceful Asia. However, the Chinese people will resolutely not allow the U.S. imperialists' war conspiracy to be realized. The Japanese people under the control of the U.S. imperialists are also waging a heroic and strong struggle. We call on the Asian people to unite closely, raise vigilance, and resolutely fight to stop the U.S. imperialists from setting fire in the Far East to destroy peace and security in Asia. As long as the Asian people unite closely and advance firmly together with the peace-loving people of the world on the road to striving for peace and opposing the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to prepare a new war of aggression in the Far East, we believe that the imperialists' conspiracy to set fire in Asia will inevitably be smashed.

### 坚决制止美国准备远东新侵略战争的阴谋

    坚决制止美国准备远东新侵略战争的阴谋
    我国外交部周恩来部长代表中央人民政府于五日发表声明，对美国政府专横宣布非法单独对日和约生效，非法宣布远东委员会解散并指使所谓日蒋“和约”与非法单独对日和约同时“生效”的一连串破坏一切有关战后日本的国际协定的非法行动予以痛斥，并号召全国人民与亚洲人民团结起来，制止美国在远东制造战争的危机。对于我国政府这一声明，我们坚决地表示拥护。
    自一九四五年盟国对日本的占领开始，在处理战败后的日本的问题上，第二次世界大战的盟国之间，就出现了两种不同的，并且是截然相反的政策：一种是实行日本民主化，肃清日本军国主义，缔结真正的由一切有关国家参加的对日和约，并撤退一切外国占领军队，以保证日本成为一个独立、自由、民主、和平的国家的政策。这个政策是和平民主的政策。它表现在开罗宣言，波茨坦公告，雅尔塔协定，远东委员会的各项决定以及一九四二年一月一日的联合国宣言里面，为以苏联为首的世界和平阵营所衷心主张，并坚决为其实现而奋斗的。与此相反的另外一种政策，是恢复日本法西斯化，复兴日本军国主义，强行制造排斥中苏两国在外的单独对日和约来延长美国对日本的占领，以便降日本为美国的附属国和远东军事桥头堡的政策。这种政策是侵略与备战的政策。它是违反一切国际协定中有关日本的庄严协议而为以美国为首的帝国主义战争阵营所坚决主张并加以彻底奉行的。我们中国一贯地站在和平民主政策的一边，坚持遵守一切有关日本的国际协定，主张实现日本民主化，防止日本再度变成侵略国，缔结真正的、由一切有关国家参加的对日和约，并从日本撤退一切外国占领军队。我国外交部部长历次的声明说明了中华人民共和国全体人民在这个问题上坚定的不可动摇的立场。美帝国主义者在关于日本的问题上一连串的破坏一切国际协定，坚持侵略与备战政策的非法行为和挑衅行为，只能引起我四亿七千五百万人民全体一致的愤怒和严重警惕。全体中国人民必将为粉碎美国这一侵略与备战的政策而奋斗到底。
    美国利用它在盟军驻日总司令部的职权，在整个占领日本期间，一贯地采取各种步骤和办法来破坏它所亲自参加的一切国际协定，以实现它的侵略与备战的政策。这种政策，特别是在美国所发动的对朝鲜的侵略战争已经被中朝人民击败了之后，便更加疯狂地在进行。根据去年十月出版的日本“前卫”杂志第六十二期所载，美国在日本所已经建立的空军基地，包括横田、三泽、板付、鹿屋等在内，有五十余处之多，并且还在继续建造新的空军基地。日本在战前用以从事侵略战争的海军军港如横须贺、佐世保、吴港、舞鹤等重要军港都已修复并且加强，成为美国在日本的海军基地。美国指使其走狗吉田政府计划将已经成立的等于陆军的警察后备队七万五千人扩充为二十五万人，并要给他们装备比过去日本步兵连队火力更强的武器。在海军方面，在美国的主使之下，日本海上保安队已有舰艇三百艘，其中扫雷艇并已参加了朝鲜作战，最近又计划增加舰艇三○八艘，计二十五万吨。在日本，有关军事的工业部门与交通通讯部门如钢铁、煤油、化学、电力、铁路、电讯等事业都被美国的公私资本所控制。根据日本大藏省外资委员会发表的数字，美国政府与美国私人以各种形式在日本投下的资本总数已达三千二百亿日元，这个日本官方数目字当然是不会确实的，但是也可以看出美国把日本工业变为美国军事工业的附属部门的进展程度。这些事实很明显的指出美国在过去六年零八个多月中间，特别在它的对朝鲜的侵略战争被击败以后，是在积极武装日本，把整个日本变成它日夜梦想进行的远东新侵略战争的军事基地。
    美国政府企图以被它武装了的日本基地作为它在东南亚和太平洋区域一连串布置的中心环节。在日本的周围，美国进行了、并正在进行着一系列的侵略措施。它已经和菲律宾订立了“美菲联防条约”，又与澳洲和新西兰订立了“美澳新三边安全条约”。今年一月间，它更纠集英法两国在华盛顿举行参谋长秘密会议，来密谋在东南亚扩大侵略行动的计划。同时，它强使它在日本的走狗吉田政府与台湾蒋介石匪帮订立所谓“和约”。美国帝国主义者长期以来就妄想拿日本作为一个中心，把它这一系列的侵略组织、行动和阴谋贯穿起来，作成一个在美国完全控制之下的，类似北大西洋公约的太平洋的侵略组织。
    所有美国这一连串的行动和阴谋，其目的只有一个，那就是变日本为远东军事侵略网的中心和桥头堡，来准备一个包围中华人民共和国和苏联的新的远东侵略战争。而为了达到这一目的，一个必要步骤就是断然宣布在旧金山非法签订的单独对日和约与所谓美日安全条约和行政协定生效，非法宣布解散远东委员会，同时并指使所谓日蒋“和约”也在非法单独和约的基础之上“生效”。但是，美国政府这一系列有计划的蔑视国际协定，蓄意与中苏两国人民为敌的猖狂行动，绝不可能骇倒已经推翻了为美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动统治、并且在朝鲜战争中与朝鲜人民一起战胜了美帝国主义者的中国人民。中国人民深信自己具有最大的决心来制止美帝国主义者在远东新的侵略阴谋，不达到目的决不休止。而且在中国与日本的战争状态仍然继续存在的情况之下，两年以前在毛主席和斯大林大元帅直接指导之下所订立的，具有伟大的历史预见性的中苏友好同盟互助条约在今天更具有它的明显的意义。中苏两国人民更加紧密的团结合作必能制止美帝国主义者破坏远东和平的阴谋。
    我们知道，美国这一连串的非法行动是完全违背日本人民的意志和违反日本人民的利益的罪恶行动。日本人民要求取得真正的民主权利，而美帝国主义者则一贯疯狂剥夺日本人民的民主权利，并于最近指使他的走狗吉田政府，作为在非法单独和约生效之后对日本人民举行普遍镇压的准备，提出所谓“防止破坏活动法案”，来禁止并限制日本人民为了争取日本的民族独立和自由，为了保护自己的基本人权和改善自己的生活条件而进行斗争的权利。而在另一方面，它又命令吉田政府将日本人民的死敌——远东国际军事法庭所判决了的战犯擅自非法大批释放，至今已被解除整肃者总数已达七千二百三十三人。美帝国主义者在日本厉行恢复日本的警察统治。它百般协助和鼓励日本的法西斯团体和个人恢复活动来使日本重新走上法西斯的道路。美国为了把整个日本绑在它的战争车轮上面而宣布生效了的非法单独对日和约，及所谓安全条约和行政协定，毫无疑问地将更要加紧对日本人民的民主权利的进攻，更要加速日本在美国统治下完全法西斯化的过程。在这些所谓和约、条约和协定的重压之下，日本人民的生活水平将必然要更加低落，日本人民的苦难只有日益加深。
    美帝国主义者深知它的这些条约等等不得日本的人心，于是出动大小公私宣传机关拚命用一大堆的所谓“独立”，“自主”，“完全的主权”等字样来把带上了这些条约协定的锁链的日本装扮成好像是一个不受丝毫外国控制的主权国家。事实当然不是这样的。我们中国人民在解放了三年之后的今天还深深记得过去在美国走狗蒋介石控制之下的旧中国所处的悲惨地位，我们是能够想像得到日本人民今天所受的屈辱和他们所处的苦难境地的。我们可以看见在这些条约协定的锁链之下，日本的领空变成美国的领空，日本的领海变成美国的领海，日本的领土可以由美国随意支配。整个日本将要走上听从美国的命令而为美国进行侵略战争以招致日本的再度毁灭的前途。日本的法权被美国占领者随意破坏和割裂。日本房产和土地被美国占领者所随意霸占。日本人民的迁徙、居留和行动要听命于美国。我们可以看见日本的和平人民将要为了美国垄断资本的庞大利润而被派出国外去进行侵略战争，并为此而送死。日本的知识分子将看到他们国家的整个文化生活受到美国的战争叫嚣和下流的黄色出版物的侵袭，他们的言论自由落在美国的走狗吉田政府的刺刀下面。日本的民族资本家和中小商人将要被美货倾销和美国的封锁禁运政策弄得抬不起头来。在非法的单独对日和约及所谓安全条约和行政协定的捆缚之下，日本在实际上将变成只是美国的第四十九州。
    勇敢而富于自尊心的日本人民是早已看清了美国所强加于日本身上的这些卖国条约的真实意义的。他们深知这些卖国条约将把他们的国家和他们自己带进毁灭的深渊。他们已经并且正在为反对美国的各种压迫，特别是为反对签订这些卖国条约和听从美国指使的卖国贼吉田政府而进行着前仆后继英勇不屈的坚决斗争，使美国占领者及其走狗吉田政府受到深重的打击，并对远东争取和平的运动作了很大的贡献。对于日本人民这种庄严勇猛的争取独立、自由、民主、和平的伟大斗争，曾经从美帝国主义同样的压迫之下，经过了同样的斗争而取得了胜利的中国人民是满怀着真诚的敬意和热烈的同情与支持的。从我们自身的经验中，我们深信日本人民的伟大斗争将必然要得到最后的胜利。
    现在，美帝国主义者所一手包办的非法单独对日和约和美日安全条约已经被美国狂妄地宣布生效。整个日本从天空到海底都已经变成了美国侵略军事机构的一部分——远东军事的桥头堡。新的远东侵略战争的凶恶的阴影正笼罩着和平亚洲的每一个国家，每一个家庭。但是，中国人民坚决不许美帝国主义的战争阴谋得以实现。在美帝国主义者控制之下的日本人民，也正在作着英勇坚强的斗争。我们号召亚洲人民紧密团结，为制止美帝国主义者在远东放火来破坏亚洲的和平与安全而提高警惕，坚决奋斗。只要亚洲人民紧密的团结起来，和全世界爱好和平人民一道，向着争取和平，反对美帝国主义准备新的远东侵略战争阴谋的道路坚定前进，我们相信，帝国主义在亚洲放火的阴谋必然要被粉碎。
