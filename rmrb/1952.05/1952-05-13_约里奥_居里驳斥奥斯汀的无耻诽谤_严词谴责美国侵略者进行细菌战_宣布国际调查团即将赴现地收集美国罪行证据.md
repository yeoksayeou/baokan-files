Xinhua News Agency, May 12th dispatch from Paris: "Tonight's Paper" published Joliot-Curie's reply to a letter from Austin, the permanent representative of the United States to the United Nations Security Council, dated April 3rd. Austin's letter went to great lengths to slander Joliot-Curie, insisting that Joliot-Curie lacked "an impartial attitude" regarding the issue of American troops conducting germ warfare in Korea and China.

Joliot-Curie's reply stated: I issued an appeal, and you have responded with a letter. My appeal was not made without proper consideration. Those who are unaware that your country has been vigorously engaged in developing bacteriological weapons for more than a decade, those who may not know that your experts are working closely with experienced Japanese experts in the study of germ warfare, those who may have forgotten Hiroshima and Nagasaki, those who may not know that American troops are using murderous weapons like napalm bombs in Korea, may think it is inconceivable that people are again misusing science—to conduct germ warfare. But you, Mr. Austin, are well aware of all these facts, and you also know that in the statements of those who preside over your country's policies, and in your newspapers, there have been repeated boasts about using even the most terrifying and bizarre weapons that could destroy all of humanity. The use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China is the first realization of this threat. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, my comrade, and many Chinese scientists (many of whom have received higher education in the United States, Britain, France, and other countries) have informed me of the detailed situation of on-the-spot investigations and analyses conducted in Korea and China. They are scholars whom I deeply respect, and their learning and moral character are beyond doubt. The facts they have determined and conveyed to me prove that germ warfare is being waged.

Regarding the U.S. government's proposal to entrust the International Committee of the Red Cross to conduct an investigation after vehemently denying the use of bacteriological weapons, Joliot-Curie said: The fifth resolution passed by the Twelfth International Red Cross Conference held in Geneva did not give the organization the power to investigate crimes. You are very aware, and your government is certainly aware, that the committee's regulations do not specifically stipulate the right to conduct such investigations. Before the issue of germ warfare was raised by the Koreans and Chinese, they had already refused entry to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross based on reasons that they alone had the right to decide. Therefore, it is clear that the U.S. government knew its suggestion would not be accepted by the Koreans and Chinese when it asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to come forward. In contrast, the government of the People's Republic of China has proposed the establishment of an international investigation team with undeniable authority and impartiality, capable of collecting all the facts and evidence. This investigation team, composed of the most authoritative representatives from the scientific, legal, and religious communities, will soon be established. It will arrive at the site and collect all the facts. Before you even know who these members are, you feel compelled to heap abuse on them. This abuse will undoubtedly make cowards retreat, but it will never stop honest and courageous people from achieving the goal of truth prevailing.

Joliot-Curie refuted the shameless slander of the American "New York Times," saying: I have already seen the article in the "New York Times" that you sent me. The experts consulted by the "New York Times" have attacked some of the photos published in Beijing newspapers. These attacks on the documents published in the newspaper could themselves become the object of criticism by experts with no less authority. Joliot-Curie listed the Melk Report, Rosebury's book "Peace or Pestilence," and the statements of Congressman Sykes, Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee, after hearing secret testimony on military matters, proving that the United States had long prepared for and is currently conducting germ warfare.

Joliot-Curie concluded: Before ending this letter, I must tell you that I am astonished by the deliberately insulting tone of your letter. You accuse me of prostituting science simply because I oppose using the great Pasteur's inventions for evil purposes, simply because I have appealed to public opinion to stop the continued conduct of germ warfare. In my opinion, it is those who slaughtered 200,000 civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and ushered in the atomic age who are prostituting science. You know very well that when American scientists achieved results in their scientific and technological efforts, they pleaded with American political leaders not to use the only two atomic bombs then available, but this plea was to no avail. These two bombs were dropped before Japan had even responded to the Potsdam ultimatum. Since then, you have refused to declare atomic weapons illegal. Regarding bacteriological weapons, there is already an international agreement—the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925. Among the major powers, only Japan and the United States have not ratified this convention. Mr. Austin, as the representative of the only country that reserves the legal right to use such weapons, do you not feel embarrassed when the issue of germ warfare is raised in the United Nations? You want to use napalm bombs and germs to massacre Koreans and Chinese en masse simply because they have chosen a system different from yours and because their skin is not white. This is absolutely unacceptable. Precisely because I know everything that science can bring to the world, I will continue to work to make science serve the happiness of mankind—whether they are white, black, or yellow—and not allow it to destroy humanity for some "sacred mission."

    约里奥—居里驳斥奥斯汀的无耻诽谤
    严词谴责美国侵略者进行细菌战
    宣布国际调查团即将赴现地收集美国罪行证据
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：“今晚报”刊载了约里奥—居里对美国驻联合国安全理事会常任代表奥斯汀四月三日函的复信，奥斯汀的信极尽诽谤约里奥—居里之能事，硬说约里奥—居里对美军在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的问题缺乏“公正的态度”。
    约里奥—居里的复信说：我发出的呼吁，你已以信函回答，我的呼吁并不是没有经过正确的思考的。那些不知道贵国十多年以来大力从事于发展细菌武器的人，那些也许不知道你们的专家和有经验的日本专家密切合作研究细菌战的人，那些也许忘记了广岛和长崎的人，那些也许不知道美军在朝鲜使用像凝固汽油弹这种杀人武器的人，可能认为人们又滥用科学——进行细菌战——这件事是不可思议的。而你，奥斯汀先生，是深知这一切事实的，你也知道在主持贵国政策的人的言论中以及在你们的报纸上，曾不止一次地扬言要使用甚至可以毁灭全球人类的最可怕、最奇特的武器。在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器便是第一次实现这种威胁。中国科学院院长、我的同志郭沫若和中国许多科学家（他们之中有许多人曾在美、英、法等国受过高等教育）把在朝鲜和中国进行实地调查和分析的详细情况通知了我，他们都是我十分敬重的学者，他们的学问和道德品质是无可怀疑的。他们所确定并转达给我的事实证明细菌战是在进行着。
    约里奥—居里就美国政府在矢口否认使用细菌武器后建议委托红十字国际委员会进行调查一事说：在日内瓦召开的第十二届国际红十字代表会议所通过的第五项决议，并没有给该组织以对罪行进行调查的权力。你非常了解，贵国政府也当然知道：这个委员会的条例中并没有特别规定有权进行这种调查。朝鲜人和中国人在细菌战问题提出以前，就已经根据他们自己才有权决定的理由，拒绝红十字国际委员会的代表入境。因此，显然美国政府在请红十字国际委员会出面的时候，便已经明知它的建议是不会被朝鲜人和中国人接受的。与此相反，中华人民共和国政府建议成立具有无可争辩的权威性和公正性、能够收集所有的事实和证据的国际调查团。这个由科学界、法律界和宗教界最权威的代表组成的调查团很快就将建立起来。它将到达现地并收集所有的事实。你们还没有知道这些委员是谁，就认为必须对他们加以恶言谩骂了。这种谩骂毫无疑问会使懦夫退却，但却决阻挡不了正直和刚勇的人们达到使真理战胜的目标。
    约里奥—居里驳斥美国“纽约时报”的无耻污蔑说：我已经知道了你给我的那一份“纽约时报”上的文章，为“纽约时报”所咨询的专家们曾经抨击北京报纸所载的几幅照片。这些对报上所载的文件的抨击，本身却又可能成为受绝非较少权威的专家批评的对象。约里奥—居里列举了墨尔克的报告、罗兹伯里的“和平或是瘟疫”一书，以及美国众议院拨款小组委员会主席赛克斯在听取有关军事性质问题的秘密作证以后的谈话，证明美国曾经长期准备了并且正在进行着细菌战。
    约里奥—居里最后说：在结束这封信之前，我要告诉你，你来信中故意侮辱我的口吻使我感到惊异。你骂我奸淫科学，只不过是因为我反对把伟大的巴斯德的发明用于罪恶之途罢了，只不过是因为我呼吁舆论阻止继续进行细菌战罢了。据我看来，奸淫科学的倒是那些残杀二十万广岛和长崎的平民而开创原子世纪的人。你知道得很清楚，美国科学家在他们的科学技术努力得到结果时，曾恳求美国政治首脑不要使用当时仅有的两枚原子弹，不过这种恳求却毫无效果。在日本还没有回答波茨坦最后通牒以前，这两枚炸弹就投下了。从那时起，你们就不同意宣布原子武器为非法。关于细菌武器，已经有了国际协定——一九二五年六月十七日的日内瓦议定书。在大国中只有日本和美国没有批准这个公约。奥斯汀先生，你作为唯一保留使用这种武器的合法权的国家的代表，当细菌战问题在联合国提出时，你难道不感觉难为情吗？你们因为朝鲜人和中国人选择了和贵国不同的制度，因为他们的皮肤不是白色的，就想用凝固汽油弹和细菌来大批屠杀他们，这是决不能容许的。正因为我知道科学所能给世界带来的一切东西，所以我将继续努力使科学为人类的幸福服务——不管他们是白种人、黑种人或黄种人，而不让它为了什么“神圣的使命”来毁灭人类。
