    A Factory in Shenyang Formulates an Advanced Plan for Increased Production and Thrift
    The Entire Factory's Planning Process Becomes a Process of Promoting and Learning from Advanced Experiences
    A state-owned factory in Shenyang has formulated an advanced plan for increased production and thrift. This year, the factory's production target was originally 40 percent higher than last year, and costs were to be reduced by 6.9 percent. According to the current plan for increased production and thrift, in addition to completing the above production tasks, the factory can further increase production and save wealth equivalent to 50,000 tons of grain.
    This advanced plan for increased production and thrift is the result of the factory's planned and systematic mobilization of the masses to find "tricks." In half a month, they completed the entire process of formulating the plan for increased production and thrift by taking steps such as digging into thoughts, finding tricks, and approving at each level.
    The factory's work of digging into thoughts was quite extensive and thorough. According to post-event conversations between the factory's Party Committee cadres and more than eighty workers, it was found that only two people were not ideologically prepared for increased production and thrift, and many workers had even thought about what "tricks" to find. In the work of digging into thoughts, they established a new understanding from top to bottom, that vigorously promoting advanced production experience and improving technology is the key to increasing production and thrift. In order to clarify this understanding, they successively organized discussions among the factory's leading cadres and all factory cadres and Party and League members, trained work section chiefs, team leaders, and propagandists, and organized core groups in each workshop, veteran workers, and young workers to hold separate forums to discuss the political and economic significance of this movement and the methods for formulating, implementing, and executing the plan for increased production and thrift. For some backward workers, the factory also specially convened forums to help them solve various ideological problems and concrete difficulties, and organized them to participate in this movement. Through these discussions and the education of leading cadres, the incorrect thinking existing among some cadres and some workers, such as "last year's increase in production has already reached its peak" and only wanting to find big tricks and disdaining to find small tricks, has also been corrected.
    During the discussion and formulation of the plan for increased production and thrift, each workshop adopted the method of finding difficulties to mobilize the masses to solve difficult problems in production; a "find tricks" movement was launched. Most work teams studied "tricks" to continue to improve product quality and reduce costs on the basis of the current highest production level. The Second Workshop used the "Red Flag Topic Reward" method, writing the problems of each team on a red flag, and whoever was confident of solving it would take the red flag. As a result, forty-five of the fifty difficult topics were taken away that day. In the twelve days from April 26, the entire factory had more than 660 "tricks" and rationalization proposals, of which rationalization proposals and "tricks" related to technical improvement accounted for 37 percent, of which sixteen "tricks" can increase production and save wealth equivalent to 8,640 tons of grain by the end of this year. For the advanced experiences of each workshop and team, the workers conducted democratic evaluation, publicly elected advanced figures, and conducted technical performances, affirming that those advanced experiences should be promoted and learned from. As a result, the entire factory's planning process also became a process of learning from advanced experiences.
    After the increased production and thrift plans of each individual, team, and workshop were formulated from bottom to top, they all went through the procedure of discussion and approval at each level from top to bottom, and then the factory department comprehensively balanced and announced them throughout the factory. After the announcement, the masses were organized to discuss and sign collective contracts, which became the responsibility and covenant of all employees, and a patriotic competition was launched to achieve this task.

    沈阳某厂制订先进的增产节约计划
    全厂制订计划的过程成为推广和学习先进经验的过程
    沈阳市某国营工厂已制订出先进的增产节约计划。这个厂今年的生产任务，本来比去年增加了百分之四十，成本要比去年降低百分之六点九。根据现在订的增产节约计划，除完成以上生产任务外，还可再增产节约价值五万吨粮食的财富。
    这一先进的增产节约计划是这个厂有计划、有步骤地深入发动群众找“窍门”的结果。他们在半月的时间内，采取了挖思想、找窍门、和层层批准等步骤，完成了全部制订增产节约计划的过程。
    这个厂挖思想的工作做得相当广泛深入。据厂的中共党委会干部和八十多个工人事后交谈，发现只有两个人对增产节约思想上没有准备，很多工人甚至连找什么“窍门”都想好了。他们在挖思想的工作中，从上到下树立了一种新的认识，就是大力推广先进生产经验和改进技术是增产节约的关键。为了明确这种认识，他们先后在厂的领导干部和全厂干部和党、团员中组织了讨论，训练了工长、组长和宣传员，并组织各车间核心小组、老年工人和青工等分头举行座谈会，讨论这次运动的政治、经济意义及制订增产节约计划和贯彻执行的办法。对于某些落后工人，厂里也专门召集过座谈会，帮助他们解决各种思想问题和具体困难，组织他们也参加到这一运动中来。经过这些讨论和领导干部的教育，部分干部和一些工人中存在的“去年增产已经到顶”以及只想找大窍门不屑找小窍门等不正确思想也得到纠正。
    在讨论和制订增产节约计划时，各车间曾采用找困难的办法，发动群众解决生产中的疑难问题；展开找窍门运动。各组工人大多是在现有最高生产水平上，研究继续提高产品质量、降低成本的“窍门”。第二车间用“红旗课题悬赏”的方法，把各组的问题写在红旗上，谁有把握解决，就拿到红旗。结果五十个疑难课题，当天就给拿走了四十五个。全厂在四月二十六日起的十二天中，共出现大小窍门和合理化建议六百六十多项，其中有关技术改进的合理化建议和窍门占百分之三十七，其中十六项窍门实行后到今年年底即可增产节约八千六百四十吨粮食的财富。对于各车间、小组的先进经验，工人们曾进行过民主评定公选先进人物，进行技术表演，肯定那些先进经验应加以推广和学习。结果使全厂制订计划的过程，也成为学习先进经验的过程。
    各车间的个人、小组和车间的增产节约计划从下而上地订出来后，都经过从上而下层层讨论批准的手续，再由厂部综合平衡和在全厂公布。公布后再组织群众讨论签订集体合同，成为全体职工的职责和公约，并为实现这项任务展开了爱国主义竞赛。
