The achievements of afforestation in the past three years

The heroic and hardworking people of the old liberated areas of western Hebei, in order to overcome the natural disasters of wind, sand, waterlogging and drought that have long plagued them, and to achieve the goal of patriotic increased production, began a large-scale afforestation movement in 1949 under the leadership of the People's Government. In the past three years, according to statistics from only five counties with more serious sandy wasteland, namely, Xingtang, Xinle, Wuji, Zhengding, and Gaocheng, more than 106,900 mu of sandy wasteland has been afforested, which can fix more than 133,300 mu of sand, accounting for 42 percent of the 310,000 mu of pure sandy wasteland in the five counties.

In order to continue to expand the afforestation area in a more planned way, these five counties, with the help of the Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Forestry, have formulated a three-year afforestation plan that began to be implemented in 1951. According to this plan, more than 24 million seedlings of locust, Amorpha fruticosa, etc. will be planted in the three major sandy wastelands such as "Shendaotan" within three years, creating a windbreak forest network that can fix 120,000 mu of shifting sand. While implementing the above plan, these five counties are also preparing to widely mobilize the masses to carry out cooperative afforestation in scattered sandy wastelands, so that all 310,000 mu of pure sandy wasteland in the five counties will be transformed into productive land, and more than 200,000 mu of sandy land that has been subjected to wind and sand erosion for many years will be spared from continuing harm.

The appearance of sandy wasteland has begun to change

Xingtang, Xinle and other counties in western Hebei were originally a vast cotton and wheat producing area; however, in the past, under the oppression and devastation of the reactionary ruling class, forests were cut down, rivers changed their courses, and gradually turned into a sandy wasteland. Since then, the farmers in this area have suffered from wind and sand erosion for many years. For example, in the spring of 1949, there was a big sandstorm, and more than 130,000 mu of peas and wheat seedlings in Xinle County alone were damaged, resulting in an average reduction of 60% in the annual harvest. As for yellow sand filling wells and engulfing fertile fields and houses, it was also a common occurrence.

After 40% of the 120,000 mu of the three major sandy wastelands were built with windbreak forest networks, the situation was very different. Many of the desolate sand dunes of the past have now become forest belts with a preliminary scale. Due to the changes in natural conditions, the farmers in this area have begun to get rid of the disasters brought by wind and sand. For example, Huangjiazhuang Village in Xinle County, where sandy wasteland accounts for one-third of the total land, has been able to surround the sandy wasteland layer by layer after three years of planting trees and afforestation, reducing the damage of wind and sand to crops. The farmers in this village have begun to receive the benefits of the forest. For example, Sun Ruizhen's 11 mu of well-irrigated land north of the village used to be often reduced in yield due to wind and sand damage, causing the whole family to lack food and clothing. After the windbreak forest grew up, the harvest was guaranteed. Another example is Wang Shouyi and other 11 families in this village, who have more than 111 mu of cultivated land in the southwest of the village. In the past, under the erosion of wind and sand, each mu only yielded more than three dou of grain; last year, each mu yielded an average of one shi and one dou.

Created and summarized afforestation experience

The farmers in western Hebei who have been fighting against wind, sand and other disasters for a long time have accumulated a lot of afforestation experience. The first is to master the planting technology and improve the survival rate of layering and tree planting. In the past, many people in this area used willows to layer afforestation on dry and barren sandy wastelands, and the survival rate was often less than half. Later, after summarizing the experience of the masses, the method of "deep burial, dense smashing, less exposure, dense planting" and "bow-shaped layering method" were promoted in the layering, and the survival rate was generally increased to about 90%. In planting seedlings, they also experienced that locust and Amorpha fruticosa have the highest survival rate in dry and barren sandy soil, grow the fastest, and have the greatest effect of preventing wind and fixing sand.

The second is to promote the method of afforestation in three seasons (spring, rainy season, autumn) a year. In the past, farmers in the sandy wasteland area of western Hebei were generally accustomed to afforestation only in spring, and started very late, often planting after the trees had sprouted, thus reducing the survival rate and not growing well. After summarizing the experience of Jia Lanhua and others, the model of afforestation in western Hebei, they generally promoted the method of "planting trees early in spring, planting trees in rainy days in summer, and afforestation late in autumn."

The third is to promote a simple and easy-to-use field seedling raising method. This seedling raising method has many advantages. First of all, it reduces the land occupied by the "stepway" and reduces the capillary evaporation caused by the hard "stepway" by changing the "high bed" and "low bed" (the seedling bed is higher than the surrounding "stepway" is called "high bed", and the "stepway" lower than the surrounding "stepway" is called "low bed") operation method used in the past, thereby reducing the number of irrigations by more than half. Secondly, weeding and intertillage can be done with animal-drawn cultivators. Due to the saving of bed-making labor and the use of cultivating livestock for intertillage, preliminary experiments show that this seedling raising method saves half the labor compared with general high and low bed operations. At the same time, since all the soil in the nursery can maintain moisture and looseness, the roots of the seedlings cultivated are developed, and the plants are strong and uniform. The one-year-old seedlings of locust, Amorpha fruticosa, etc. cultivated in this way are very suitable for afforestation in dry and barren sandy land.

This seedling raising method has a slightly lower seedling yield; now, under the on-site guidance of Soviet expert Nie Nalaokomov, the "parallel ridge" and "dense ridge" sowing methods are being tested. If this method is successful, the seedling yield per mu can be increased by more than 50%.

Due to the promotion of the field seedling raising method, the masses of farmers have generally mastered the seedling raising technology. Last year, the masses in the key afforestation villages in various counties have cultivated more than 2.6 million seedlings of Amorpha fruticosa, etc., for cooperative afforestation.

In addition, their experience also proves that the effect of organizing cooperative afforestation is very great. The achievements of afforestation in western Hebei in the past three years are inseparable from the widespread establishment of afforestation cooperatives for cooperative afforestation.

    冀西人民合作营造防风林网

    三年来造林的成就
    河北西部老解放区英勇勤劳的人民，为了战胜长期困扰他们的风沙水旱等自然灾害，达到爱国丰产的目的，从一九四九年开始，在人民政府领导下，开展了大规模的造林运动。三年来，仅据行唐、新乐、无极、正定、藁城五个沙荒较多的县份统计，便完成了沙荒造林十万六千九百多亩，可固沙十三万三千多亩，占五县纯沙荒面积三十一万亩的百分之四十二。
    这五个县为了更有计划地继续扩大造林面积，在中央林业部冀西沙荒造林局的帮助下，又订定了一个自一九五一年开始执行的三年造林计划。按照这个计划，三年内在“神道滩”等三大沙荒上共栽植洋槐、紫穗槐等苗木二千四百多万株，营造成可固定流沙十二万亩的防风林网。在执行上述计划的同时，这五个县还准备广泛发动群众在零星沙荒上举办合作造林，使五县三十一万亩纯沙荒全数变为可生产的土地，使二十万多亩以前长年受风沙侵袭的沙地免于继续受害。
    开始改变了沙荒的面貌
    冀西行唐、新乐等县，原是一片广大的棉麦产区；但是，过去长期在反动统治阶级的压榨摧残下，森林被砍伐，河流改了道，逐渐变成一片沙荒。这一带的农民从此长年遭到风沙的侵害。如一九四九年春季来了一场大风沙，只新乐一县就有十三万多亩豌豆、麦苗受害，使年景平均少收六成。至于黄沙填满了水井，吞没了良田、房舍，也是常有的事。
    在十二万多亩的三大沙荒有百分之四十建立起防风林网以后，情况就大不相同了。许多昔日荒凉的沙丘，现在已成了初具规模的林带。由于自然条件的改变，这一带农民已开始摆脱了风沙带来的灾难。如沙荒几占全部土地三分之一的新乐县黄家庄，经过三年的植树造林，已能把沙荒层层围住，减免了风沙对作物的侵害。这个村的农民已开始得到森林给予的实惠。如农民孙瑞珍在村北的十一亩井浇地，以前因风沙为害，经常减收，害得全家少吃没穿。在防风林长起来以后，收成就保住了。又如这个村的王守义等十一家在村西南的一百一十一亩多耕地，往年在风沙的侵袭下，每亩只收粮三斗多；去年每亩平均收了一石一斗。
    创造和总结了造林经验
    长期和风沙等灾害进行斗争的冀西农民，已经积累了许多造林经验。第一是掌握了种植技术，提高了压条和植树的成活率。这一带的群众，过去很多人用杨柳在干瘠的沙荒上压条造林，成活率往往不到一半。后来，经过总结群众的经验，在压条中推行了“深埋、密砸、少露、密栽”的方法和“弓形压条法”以后，成活率普遍提高到百分之九十左右。在栽植树苗上，他们也体验出：洋槐、紫穗槐在干瘠的沙土中成活率最高，生长最快，防风固沙的作用最大。
    第二是推广了一年三季（春季、雨季、秋季）造林的方法。冀西沙荒区的农民过去一般习惯于只在春季造林，而且动手很晚，往往在树木发芽后才栽植，因而成活率减低，并且成长得不好。在总结了冀西造林模范贾兰虎等人的经验后，他们就普遍推广了“春季栽树要早，夏季栽树要在连雨天，秋季造林要晚”的方法。
    第三是推广了简便易行的大田育苗法。这种育苗法的优点很多，首先是由于改变了过去沿用的“高床”、“低床”（苗床比四周“步道”高的叫“高床”，比四周“步道”低的叫“低床”）的作业法，减少了“步道”占去的土地和减免了由坚硬的
    “步道”所引起的毛细管蒸发作用，从而减少一半以上的灌溉次数。其次是锄草中耕可以用畜力曳引耘锄。由于节省打床工和可用耕畜中耕等，据初步实验这种育苗法比一般高、低床作业省力一半。同时由于圃地全部土壤能保持湿润疏松，所育苗木根部发达，棵株健壮均匀。这样育成的洋槐、紫穗槐等一年生的树苗，很适用于干瘠沙地造林。
    这种育苗法产苗量稍低；现在，在苏联专家聂拿洛科莫夫的实地指导下，正试用“并垅”“密垅”播种法。假如这个方法实验成功，每亩苗木产量可提高百分之五十以上。
    由于大田育苗法的推广，农民群众普遍掌握了育苗技术。去年各县植林重点村的群众已育成紫穗槐等苗木二百六十多万株，用于合作造林。
    此外，他们的经验还证明：组织起来合作造林的效果是很大的。三年来冀西造林的成绩，是和广泛建立造林合作社进行合作造林分不开的。
