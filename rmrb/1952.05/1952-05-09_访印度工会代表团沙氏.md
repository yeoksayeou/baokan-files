An interview with Mr. Shah of the Indian Trade Union Delegation

Mr. Shah, Chairman of the United Trades Union Congress of India, who came to China at the invitation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to attend the May Day celebrations, received reporters who interviewed him on the 4th.

On May Day, Mr. Shah saw the 500,000-strong parade in China's capital. Recalling the scene of May Day, he said: "That day left a very deep impression on me. So many people participated in the parade, but they were so punctual, demonstrating a high degree of discipline and strict organization, which is sufficient to represent the Chinese national character. I have never seen anything like it. The people in the parade were so happy! They held flags and shouted slogans. That great scene moved me very much." He said that May Day is a festival of solidarity and struggle for the working people of the world, and the liberation of the Chinese people was achieved after many years of struggle. The May Day parade symbolizes the Chinese people's confidence and strength in the struggle for peace. Many representatives from various countries have said that after returning home, they must find ways to consolidate friendship with the Chinese people and strive to promote world peace.

Before May Day, Mr. Shah visited the countryside in the suburbs of Beijing after the land reform and the Summer Palace, a place of scenic beauty. He said: "The visit to the countryside also left a deep impression on me. I saw how the old China has been transformed into a new China, and how the Chinese peasants are establishing a new way of life." He said that this was his first time in China, and he could not make a specific comparison between the situation before and after China's liberation. However, he said, "The peasants are actively working and producing for themselves, their food is sufficient, and their nutrition is adequate. New houses have been built. Especially those happy children, they are the next generation of China; from them and their lives, you can see the development prospects of New China. They will fight for the future of the Chinese people and the people of the world." When talking about the Summer Palace, he praised it as a great legacy of Chinese history and Chinese art. The vast lake, the magnificent long corridor, and the splendid palaces all gave him an unforgettable impression. He particularly emphasized, "What satisfies me most is that it has become a place for the Chinese working people to visit."

Mr. Shah briefly introduced the living conditions and the labor movement of Indian workers. He said that the majority of the Indian population is engaged in agriculture. Industrial workers are concentrated in big cities, with a total of 2.5 million to 3 million, of which railway workers account for 1 million. They have been organized into trade unions according to regions or industrial systems. There are four national trade unions in India, namely the All India Trade Union Congress, the United Trades Union Congress of India, the All India Labour Federation, and the Indian National Trade Union Congress. Some rights of workers and trade unions have been legally recognized. However, he said that the Indian working class is still very dissatisfied with its working and living conditions. Because prices are rising in India, and the cost of living is too high; certain improvements in working and living conditions are disproportionate to the soaring prices. And for the sake of the unity of the working class, the various trade unions in India are also trying to unify their organizations.

Peace is the basic demand of the people all over the world today. Mr. Shah said that the Indian people are doing everything possible to support the international peace movement and the World Peace Council; because, like the people of other countries, the sincere desire of the Indian people is peace. The Indian people hope to maintain friendly and cooperative relations with all peace-loving people in the world, hope that the people oppressed by imperialism and colonialism will be liberated, hope that the economies of backward countries can develop, and hope that all mankind will enjoy a life of peace, progress, and prosperity.

Finally, Mr. Shah said: "The Indian people are very willing to strengthen friendship with the Chinese people, and there are many ways to strengthen friendship." He said: "Although transportation between China and India is not very convenient, as long as we are determined, then, in addition to diplomatic contacts, we have many ways to strengthen ties. For example, we can convene conferences on trade unions, literature and art, education, women, and other aspects in a planned and regular manner to enhance mutual understanding and solve some relevant specific problems. And what is particularly urgent is to improve transportation conditions and strengthen trade relations. China is rich in products, and India also has some goods that can be exported. Both sides can guarantee equality and mutual benefit. For example, India is in great need of food. If cooperation is good, India does not have to buy food from the United States. Therefore, close trade relations between China and India can play a great role in friendly cooperation between the two sides."

    访印度工会代表团沙氏
    应中华全国总工会的邀请前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的印度统一工会大会主席沙氏，在四日接见了访问他的记者。
    在“五一”节那天，沙氏看到了我国首都五十万人的大游行。他回味“五一”节的景象说：“那一天给我的印象是非常深刻的。参加游行的人那么多，但是，却那样遵守时刻，表现出高度的纪律性和严密的组织性，足以代表中国的民族性，这是我从来没有见过的。游行的人们多么快乐啊！他们举着旗子，高呼着口号。那种伟大的场面，使我很受感动。”他说：“五一”节是全世界劳动人民团结斗争的节日，而中国人民的解放正是经过了很多年的斗争才得到的。“五一”的游行，象征着中国人民为和平而斗争的信心和力量。很多国家的代表们都说：回国以后，一定要设法巩固和中国人民之间的友谊，努力促进世界和平。
    在“五一”节以前，沙氏曾经参观了北京市郊的实行土地改革以后的农村和名胜颐和园。他说：“农村的访问给我的印象也是很深刻的。我看出了旧的中国怎样变成了新的中国，中国的农民在怎样的建立一种新的生活方式。”他说：他是第一次来到中国的，他不能把中国解放前后的情况加以具体的比较。但是，他说：“农民们积极地为自己而劳动生产，他们的食物是充足的，营养也很够，新的房屋已经盖起来。尤其是那些快活的儿童，他们是中国的下一代；从他们身上和他们的生活里，可以看到新中国的发展远景，他们将要为中国人民和世界人民的未来而奋斗。”在谈到颐和园的时候，他赞扬那是中国历史和中国艺术的伟大遗产。那广阔的湖水、雄伟的长廊和宏丽的宫殿等，都给了他难以磨灭的印象。他特别强调地说：“使我最满意的是那里已经变成了中国劳动人民游览的场所。”
    沙氏简单地介绍了印度工人生活和工人运动的情况。他说：印度的大部分人口是从事农业的，产业工人都集中在大城市里，一共有二百五十万人到三百万人，其中铁路工人占一百万人。他们已经分别按照地区或者产业系统，组织在工会里面。印度的全国性的工会有四个，就是全印工会大会、印度统一工会大会、全印劳工协会和印度全国工会大会。工人和工会的某些权利得到了法律上的承认。但是，他说：印度工人阶级对于自己的工作条件和生活条件还是很不满意的。因为印度物价上涨，生活费用太高；工作条件和生活条件的某些改进是和物价的暴涨不成比例的。而为了工人阶级的团结，印度的各个工会也在设法统一他们的组织。
    和平，这是全世界人民当前的基本要求。沙氏说：印度人民是尽一切力量支持国际上的和平运动、支持世界保卫和平大会的；因为，和其他各国人民一样，印度人民的衷心愿望就是和平。印度人民希望和世界上一切爱好和平的人民保持友好合作的关系，希望在帝国主义和殖民制度压迫下的人民得到解放，希望落后国家的经济能够发展，希望全人类都享受到和平、进步和繁荣的生活。
    最后，沙氏说：“印度人民非常愿意加强和中国人民的友谊，加强友谊的方法是很多的。”他说：“虽然，中国和印度之间的交通还不大方便，但是，只要我们有决心，那么，除了外交上的接触以外，我们还有很多办法来加强联系。例如：可以有计划地、经常地召开工会、文学艺术、教育、妇女等各方面的会议，增进互相之间的了解和解决一些有关的具体问题。而要求特别迫切的是改进交通条件和加强贸易关系。中国物产丰饶，印度也有些货物可以出口，双方可以保证平等互利。例如：印度非常需要粮食，如果合作得好，印度就可以不向美国买粮食。所以，密切中国和印度的贸易关系，对于双方的友好合作能够起很大的作用。”
