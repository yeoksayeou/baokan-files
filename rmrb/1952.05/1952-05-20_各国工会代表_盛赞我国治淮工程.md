Xinhua News Agency, Yangzhou, 18th. More than 120 representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions and various countries' trade unions, who were invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations, visited the main irrigation canal of the lower reaches of the Huai River on the 15th and 16th, and were warmly welcomed by the local working people. When visiting the Gaoliangjian water intake sluice, representatives from countries including the Soviet Union, India, Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, and Algeria, led by Shevchenko, head of the Soviet trade union delegation and Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, enthusiastically joined the workers in operating pile drivers, helping transport workers push cement, and carry earth. They presented trade union charters from their respective countries to the laborers, took photos with the Huai River control heroes, and were extremely excited. The representatives highly praised the main irrigation canal and the Gaoliangjian water intake sluice project. William Stevens, a British worker representative and a construction worker from London, said: He had never seen such a large-scale project, nor had he ever seen construction workers so enthusiastic about construction. He said: A project like the main irrigation canal would take five to ten years in a capitalist country, but it was completed in just four months in New China. This is simply a miracle.
    The representatives returned to Yangzhou on the afternoon of the 17th and then went to Hangzhou via Zhenjiang. When the representatives left Yangzhou, they were warmly seen off by more than 15,000 representatives from Yangzhou people's organizations and students. After Yangzhou Mayor Yang Zutong delivered a farewell speech, World Federation of Trade Unions representative Thornton replied: "We will never forget this great miracle of transforming natural disasters into people's welfare. From the example of the Huai River project, we have seen Chairman Mao's brilliant vision. This kind of labor enthusiasm can only be brought into play after the people are liberated from oppression. This kind of labor enthusiasm is in stark contrast to the situation of workers in capitalist and colonial countries." As the cars drove out of Yangzhou, the representatives and the well-wishers cheered in unison: "Long live Mao Zedong!"

    各国工会代表
    盛赞我国治淮工程
    【新华社扬州十八日电】应邀前来我国参加“五一”节观礼的世界工联和各国工会代表等一百二十多人，于十五日、十六日两日参观淮河下游灌溉总渠的工程，受到当地劳动人民的热烈欢迎。在参观高良涧进水闸时，以苏联工会代表团团长、全苏工会中央理事会书记谢甫钦科为首包括苏联、印度、捷克斯洛伐克、蒙古、阿尔及利亚等国的代表，曾热情地和职工一道打硪，帮助运输工推送水泥、抬土，他们以各国工会会章赠给民工们，并与治淮英雄合影，情绪极为兴奋。代表们对灌溉总渠及高良涧进水闸工程极表赞扬。英国工人代表伦敦建筑工人威廉姆·斯提文斯表示：他从来没有看到像这样大规模的工程，也从来没有看到建筑工人这样热心从事建筑。他说：像灌溉总渠这样的工程，如果在资本主义的国家将需要五年到十年的时间，而在新中国只在短短的四个月内就完成了，这简直是一个奇迹。
    代表们已在十七日下午返回扬州，转道镇江赴杭州。代表们在离开扬州时受到扬州人民团体与学生代表一万五千多人的热烈欢送。扬州市市长杨祖彤致欢送词后，世界工联代表桑顿致答词说：“我们将永远不会忘记这一把自然的灾害改造成为人民的福利的伟大奇迹。从治淮工程的实例中，我们看到了毛主席的英明远见。民工们的这种劳动热情只有在人民从压迫中解放出来以后才能发挥出来。这种劳动热情与资本主义及殖民地国家里的工人情况恰成鲜明的对比。”当汽车开出扬州时，代表们与欢送者齐声欢呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
