    American imperialists, harboring ambitions to dominate the world, are increasingly and frantically preparing for war, establishing military bases everywhere, arming West Germany in Europe, and rearming Japan in Asia, attempting to push the people of the world from peaceful lives into the abyss of another world war.
    In Asia, we clearly see that the warmongers of Wall Street are baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, controlling Japan, invading China's territory of Taiwan, and carrying out a war of aggression against Korea. In order to further arm Japan and expand the war of aggression, they disregarded the resolute opposition of the people of the world and the people of Japan, forcibly creating an illegal, one-sided "peace treaty with Japan" without the participation of China, the Soviet Union, India, and Burma, and publicly announced that this illegal "peace treaty with Japan" would officially take effect on April 28th of this year. This not only completely tore up the solemn Potsdam Agreement and Proclamation and other international agreements but also ran counter to the Japanese people's desire to strive for independence, freedom, and democracy. It is entirely a war treaty to enslave the Japanese people and turn Japan into a military base and colony for American aggressors. This cannot but directly threaten peace in Asia and the Pacific.
    The American conspiracy to frantically arm Japan and expand the war of aggression has actually been exposed everywhere. For example, Japan's military production, including the production of heavy weapons, ammunition, warships, and aircraft, has now been openly restored and expanded on a large scale. The so-called Japanese police reserve force has now actually been equipped as a modern force, and there are plans to massively expand it into a formal army. More than 100,000 Japanese war criminals and militarists, whose hands are stained with the blood of the people of Asia and the Pacific, and even Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru, who was convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and many notorious war criminals have been successively released or had their "purges" lifted. Not only that, but Japanese germ warfare criminal Shiro Ishii and others are being employed by the United States to manufacture large quantities of murderous germ weapons to massacre the people of China and Korea. All of this shows that the American government's policy of aggression and war brings serious threats to the lives and safety of the people of Asian and Pacific countries.
    After suffering serious defeats in the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialists have shown no signs of repentance and continue to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, which have been dragging on for ten months; deliberately violating the principle of releasing all prisoners of war stipulated in the Geneva Convention, which the American government itself signed, unreasonably insisting on so-called "voluntary repatriation," attempting to detain large numbers of captured Korean and Chinese personnel, causing the negotiations to fail to reach an agreement, the Korean people are still unable to live peaceful days, and the captured personnel on both sides are still unable to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families. The American aggressors should bear full responsibility for this. Recently, the American aggressors have become even more brazen, recklessly violating international conventions and the constraints of human morality, and are actually conducting germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and using inhumane means to massacre prisoners of war and the Korean people, attempting to force the Korean and Chinese sides to accept their unreasonable conditions in the negotiations. Of course, the heroic Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Korean and Chinese people will never yield. We have the strength to resolutely resist and eliminate the harm of the germ warfare waged by the American aggressors. However, this provocation by the American aggressors to expand the war of aggression is absolutely intolerable and must be regarded as a criminal atrocity against the entire people of Asia, the Pacific, and the world and must be stopped, as pointed out by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his statement of February 24: "If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has befallen the peaceful people of Korea today will befall the peaceful people of the world tomorrow."
    In the Asian and Pacific region, in addition to China and Korea being subjected to armed aggression by American imperialism and Japan being turned into a colony of American imperialism, Vietnam is being subjected to armed aggression by French imperialism. Other countries, due to the American, British, and French imperialists, spare no effort to use various methods of coercion and enticement, attempting to drag them into the path of adventurous war preparations, their internal affairs have been subjected to blatant interference; the so-called "embargoes" and "blockades" have caused serious crises in the economies of these countries; due to the lack of freedom in trade exchanges, the prices of export goods in these countries have recently plummeted, a large number of workers have become unemployed, the living standards of the people have rapidly declined and deteriorated, and famine has occurred. All of this shows that under the imperialist policy of war preparations, the movement of these countries to restore sovereign independence and integrity faces greater difficulties, and the peaceful lives of the people have been further hindered and threatened.
    However, the people of Asian and Pacific countries are eagerly demanding and loving peace. The wounds and disasters they suffered in World War II at the hands of Japanese militarists have not yet healed. Therefore, their need for a peaceful life, like the people of European countries who have been directly ravaged by Nazi Germany, is very urgent. This desire for peace and opposition to war, for independence and opposition to aggression, is universal and ardent in every corner of the world. This demand is also completely reasonable. Under the high pressure of the American occupiers and the reactionary government of their own country, the Japanese people have always stubbornly insisted on struggling for national independence, democracy, and peace, and their strength is growing stronger and stronger; the peace movements of the people of Southeast Asia and Australia are flourishing day by day; and the struggles of the people of North and South America for independence and peace are also growing stronger and stronger. The peace movement launched by peace-loving people to realize their desire for peace is a sacred cause. Except for imperialist aggressors who fear the peace movement and try their best to sabotage it, all peace-loving and righteous people in the world will surely enthusiastically support and support this great peace movement.
    Our country, headed by Song Qingling and Guo Moruo, with eleven people who are prestigious and have contributed to the cause of peace, representing the will of the Chinese people and accepting the suggestions of India and other friendly countries, jointly invited peace-loving and just people from Asian, Australian, and American countries along the Pacific coast to jointly initiate the convocation of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing, the capital of China. This is a completely timely measure. Under the current situation, as the eleven peace advocates said in their letter of initiation: "Peace cannot wait, peace needs peace-loving people to unite and strive for. The people of the Asian and Pacific region mobilize to strive for peace, and peace in the Asian and Pacific region can be guaranteed."
    After the letter of initiation for the conference was issued on March 21, it quickly received enthusiastic responses from peace-loving people in Asian, Australian, and American countries along the Pacific coast, and they successively established preparatory committees for their own country to participate in the conference, and elected people who have contributed to the cause of peace, have prestige, and love peace to participate in the joint initiation, and at the same time, they launched preparations for participating in the conference. Thanks to the unremitting efforts of peace movement leaders and the vast number of peace-loving people in various countries, in order to promote the convening of the conference, with the consent of various countries, it has now been decided that the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be held in Beijing on May 28 of this year. This shows that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has not only entered an active preparation stage but will also be able to be convened at an early date due to active preparation. This is a deeply gratifying thing.
    The Chinese people have always loved peace. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's foreign policy of peace declared to the world and stipulated in the "Common Program" of "upholding lasting international peace and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries," opposing imperialist policies of aggression and war. In the past three years, the People's Republic of China has become increasingly consolidated and powerful, and in addition to the Soviet Union, it has become an extremely powerful force in the Asian and Pacific region for defending Asian and world peace. Our government has repeatedly declared to the outside world its willingness to peacefully resolve all international disputes, not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and coexist peacefully with countries with different political systems. In concrete measures, our government and people have been making the greatest efforts in striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, opposing the rearmament of Japan, opposing the illegal conclusion of a separate peace treaty with Japan, supporting the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and other major international issues, as well as in restoring normal international trade, promoting cultural exchanges, and strengthening friendly cooperation among the people of all countries.
    We firmly believe that the people of Asian and Pacific countries will greet the convening of this peace conference with the same spirit and effort. We anticipate that the enemies of peace will carry out various obstructions and sabotage, but in the face of the vast and heroic peace-loving people, all destructive conspiracies will be defeated, and the steel will of the people to defend peace is invincible. We have full confidence that in this great struggle to defend the peace movement, we will surely achieve a great victory.
    We sincerely look forward to and welcome the representatives of all countries participating in the preparatory meeting to arrive victoriously in Beijing, and we wish the preparatory meeting a complete success in completing the glorious tasks of the meeting.

### 为胜利召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而斗争

    为胜利召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而斗争
    美国帝国主义者，怀抱着独霸全世界的野心，与日俱增地疯狂备战，到处建立军事基地，在欧洲武装西德，在亚洲重新武装日本，企图把全世界人民从和平的生活推进到另一次世界大战的深渊里去。
    在亚洲，我们清楚地看到：华尔街的战争贩子们张牙舞爪，控制着日本，侵占着中国领土台湾，并对朝鲜进行着侵略战争。他们为了进一步武装日本，扩大侵略战争，竟不顾全世界人民和日本人民的坚决反对，强行制造没有中国、苏联、印度、缅甸参加的非法的片面“对日和约”，并公然宣布这个非法的“对日和约”自本年四月二十八日起正式生效。这不但完全撕毁了庄严的波茨坦协定和公告等国际协议，并且与日本人民争取独立、自由和民主的愿望背道而驰，完全是奴役日本人民、变日本为美国侵略者的军事基地和殖民地的战争条约。这样就不能不使亚洲及太平洋的和平遭受到直接的威胁。
    美国疯狂地武装日本，扩大侵略战争的阴谋，实际上到处都已暴露，例如：日本的军事生产，包括重武器、弹药、军舰和飞机的生产在内，现已公开地大规模地恢复和扩充；所谓日本警察后备队，现在实际上均已装备成为现代化的部队，并且还正在计划大量扩充成为正式军队；双手染满亚洲及太平洋人民鲜血的十多万日本战犯和军国主义分子，甚至曾为远东国际法庭判罪的甲级战犯重光葵和罪恶昭彰的许多著名战犯都已被陆续释放或解除“整肃”。不但如此，日本细菌战犯石井四郎等正被美国起用，制造着大量杀人的细菌武器来虐杀中朝两国人民。这一切都说明着美国政府的侵略政策和战争政策给亚洲及太平洋各国人民的生命与安全带来严重的威胁。
    美国帝国主义者在侵朝战争中遭到严重的失败以后，丝毫没有悔祸之意，对拖延已至十个月之久的朝鲜停战谈判，仍在继续拖延和阻挠；蓄意违反美国政府自己曾经签字的日内瓦公约所规定的释放一切战俘的原则，无理地坚持所谓“自愿遣返”，企图大量扣留朝、中被俘人员，致使谈判不能达成协议，朝鲜人民仍不能够过和平的日子，双方被俘人员仍不能回到故乡与家庭团圆。这是应由美国侵略者负其全部责任的。美国侵略者最近更变本加厉，不顾一切地违反了国际公约和人类道德的约束，竟在朝鲜和中国的东北进行着细菌战，并用惨无人道的手段虐杀战俘和朝鲜人民，企图压迫朝中方面接受其谈判中无理的条件。当然，英勇的朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军和中朝人民是决不屈服的，我们有力量坚决抵抗，并消灭美国侵略者所进行的细菌战的毒害。但是，美国侵略者这种为扩大侵略战争而进行的挑衅是绝不能容忍的，必须把它看作是对整个亚洲、太平洋以及全世界人民的罪恶暴行而加以制止，正如我国外交部周恩来部长在二月二十四日的声明中所指出：“如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上。”
    亚洲及太平洋区域，除了中朝两国受到美帝国主义的武装侵略，日本变为美帝国主义的殖民地以外，越南正受到法帝国主义的武装侵略。其他各国，由于美英法帝国主义者，不惜用尽各种胁迫利诱的方法，企图把它们拖进冒险备战的道路，它们的内政已遭到横暴干涉；所谓“禁运”与“封锁”已使这些国家的经济发生严重的危机；由于贸易来往的不自由，最近已使这些国家的出口物资的价格猛跌，大批工人失业，人民生活水平急骤地降低和恶化，并发生了饥饿现象。所有这些都说明，在帝国主义的备战政策之下，这些国家恢复主权的独立和完整的运动遇到更大的困难，人民的和平生活已受到进一步的妨碍和威胁。
    但是，亚洲及太平洋各国的人民是热切地要求并爱好和平的。他们在第二次世界大战中从日本军国主义者方面所受到的创伤和灾难至今犹未恢复。因此，他们对于和平生活的需要，正如受过纳粹德国直接蹂躏的欧洲国家人民一样，是非常迫切的。这种要求和平反对战争、要求独立反对侵略的愿望，在世界任何角落都是普遍而热烈的。这种要求亦完全是合理的。日本人民在美国占领者和本国反动政府的高压之下，始终顽强地坚持着为民族独立、民主与和平而斗争，力量越来越强；东南亚及澳洲各国人民的保卫和平的运动正日益蓬勃地开展；南北美洲各国人民为争取独立与和平的斗争，亦正日益壮大。爱好和平的人民为实现和平的愿望而展开的保卫和平的运动乃是神圣的事业，除了帝国主义侵略者害怕和平运动并竭力加以破坏以外，世界上一切爱好和平和正义的人们都必定热烈地赞助和支持这伟大的保卫和平的运动。
    我国以宋庆龄、郭沫若为首的对于和平事业有声望和有贡献的十一位人士，代表中国人民的意志，并接受印度及其他友邦人士的建议，联名邀请了亚、澳、美各洲太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平与正义的人士共同发起在中国的首都北京召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，这是完全合乎时宜的措施。在目前的局势之下，正如十一位和平人士在发起书中所说：“和平绝不能等待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。亚洲及太平洋区域的人民动员起来，争取和平，亚洲及太平洋区域的和平即能得到保证。”
    会议的发起书于三月二十一日发出后，已迅速地得到亚、澳、美各洲太平洋沿岸各国广大爱好和平人士的热烈响应，纷纷成立了本国参加大会的筹备委员会，推定了本国对和平事业有贡献有声望及爱好和平的人士参加联名发起，同时并展开了参加大会的准备工作。由于各国和平运动领袖及广大爱好和平人民不懈的努力，为了促进大会的召开，经各国的同意，现已决定于本年五月二十八日在北京首先举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议。这就表明了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议不仅已进入积极准备阶段，且将因积极准备而能早日召开。这是深可欣幸的一件事。
    中国人民一向酷爱和平，中华人民共和国建国以来，中央人民政府即坚决执行着毛主席向全世界所宣布的和“共同纲领”所规定的“拥护国际的持久和平和各国人民间的友好合作”的对外和平政策，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策。将近三年来，中华人民共和国益趋巩固与强大，在苏联之外，已成为亚洲及太平洋区域中保卫亚洲和世界和平的极其强大的一支力量。我国政府曾多次对外声明主张和平解决一切国际间的纠纷，不干涉他国内政，与各种不同政治制度的国家和平共处的意愿。在具体措施上，我国政府和人民对争取朝鲜问题和平解决，反对重新武装日本，反对非法缔结单独对日和约，拥护五大国缔结和平公约等国际性重大问题，以及对恢复正常的国际贸易，促进文化交流，加强各国人民间友好合作各方面，都一直尽着最大努力。
    我们深信亚洲及太平洋各国人民一定会以同样的精神和努力来迎接这一和平会议的召开。我们预料到和平的敌人必将进行各种阻挠和破坏，但在广大的英勇的和平人民面前，一切破坏阴谋必遭失败，人民保卫和平的钢铁意志是不可战胜的。我们有充分的信心，在这一伟大的保卫和平运动的斗争中，一定能够取得伟大的胜利。
    我们热诚地期待并欢迎各国参加筹备会议的代表胜利地到达北京，并预祝筹备会议圆满地完成会议的光荣任务。
