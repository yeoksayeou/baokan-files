	Economic Briefs

	▲ Since the pre-purchase of new cotton in North China began in mid-April, according to extremely incomplete statistics from Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan provinces, and Beijing, over 100 million jin of seed cotton has been completed by the 15th of this month. In Ding County, Ci County, Shahe, and other counties in Hebei Province, many mutual aid groups have signed pre-sale contracts for new cotton with the state, accounting for 50% to 70% of their total cotton field output. Qu Yaoli, a cotton production model, led the mutual aid groups in his village to sign pre-sale contracts for 167,000 jin of new cotton with the state, exceeding the original plan by 44,700 jin. The vast majority of these contracts are credit pre-purchases. The signing of pre-sale contracts for new cotton has promoted the enthusiasm of cotton farmers to increase yield per unit area and has stimulated the further development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations.
	▲ In order to help the Tibetan people develop their economy, the state-owned Tibet Trading Company signed contracts with Tibetan merchants in Lhasa on May 2nd to purchase over 40 billion yuan worth of wool that had been stockpiled by more than 400 Tibetan wool merchants for two years at favorable prices. Su Kang Wangqing, Lhalu Tsewang Dorje, both Kalons (officials), and Zhasag (official title) Charong of the Tibetan local government, as well as Zhang Ying, the head of the Lhasa office of the People's Bank of China, participated in the contract signing. Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, and Zhang Guohua, commander of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, also personally attended the contract signing ceremony. After signing the contracts, the participating merchants unanimously expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Central People's Government for the help and care given to the Tibetan people in implementing the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
	▲ This spring, Tibet and the Qamdo region received over 3 billion yuan in interest-free and low-interest loans specially allocated by the Central People's Government and the People's Bank of China to help the vast number of farmers, herdsmen, and handicraftsmen solve the difficulties of seeds, rations, and funds during the spring and summer. The Lhasa office of the People's Bank of China has allocated funds to entrust the work team of the political department of the advance detachment of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet to form a loan committee together with the local governments and local people of the fourteen dzongs (counties) and Xietu (town) in the Lhasa area to implement key distribution. Poor farmers can obtain the amount to purchase all seeds. The People's Liberation Committees of the Rikaze local government and Bomi Dingqing in the Qamdo region of Xikang Province are also lending seeds or rations. In addition, the Lhasa office of the People's Bank of China is investigating the handicraft production situation in the city and will issue 1 billion yuan in handicraft production loans.
	▲ The transportation between ethnic minority areas in the Southwest and the interior is becoming increasingly smooth, which plays a significant role in the economic construction of ethnic minorities.
	In the two years since liberation, most of the roads in the counties of Weining in Guizhou Province and Xichang Prefecture and Maoxian Prefecture in western Sichuan Province have been repaired. In some places, narrow paths have been transformed into roads wide enough for mules and horses. Guizhou Province has built 18 highways from Weining to Shuicheng, Huishui to Luodian, and others. New highways have been built from Qianwei to Shujian, Yibin to Junlian Tangba in southern Sichuan, and Miring to Sile in Yunnan, and many places are currently accelerating construction. The newly built highway from Guanxian to Maoxian in western Sichuan has been opened to traffic to Wenchuan. After this road is opened to traffic, it will greatly shorten the distance between the snow-capped mountains and grasslands and the interior, and will play a significant role in the economic construction of ethnic minorities in Maoxian Prefecture.
	▲ The Xikang Provincial People's Government has restored and repaired many cart roads and highways in the Ya'an and Xichang areas, which has greatly promoted the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Last year, the Provincial People's Government repaired the 350-kilometer highway between Ya'an and Xichang and built more than ten mule and horse trails and cart roads totaling more than 900 kilometers between the counties. Now, Ya'an's cloth, general merchandise, and table salt have been transported to Zhaojue City in the central area of the Liangshan Mountains and Ningnan and Yanbian on the border of Kangdian, where Yi people live, and the counties' rice, bristles, white wax, asbestos, and other local products can also be transported out.
	In mid-April, the Xikang Provincial People's Government held a transportation conference and decided to add 1,281 kilometers of mule and horse trails and 166 kilometers of cart roads to Xichang to Kangding, Kangding to Danba, Kangding to Batang, and Ganzi to Xinlong, and restore 260 kilometers of highways. Erect 708 kilometers of power lines. After the completion of all projects, the Tibetan Autonomous Region can import a large amount of cheap rice from Xichang and Danba, and transport a large amount of fur and medicinal materials to Ya'an.
