    Shandong Acid Plant Workers Cherish State Property, Not Wasting a Single Useful Thing
    To the Editor: After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the concept of cherishing state property has been greatly strengthened among the workers of the state-owned Shandong Acid Plant. The workers cherish everything in the factory very much, not allowing a single bit to be wasted. The seven workers in the catalyst team saw that the copper ore picked out from the boiler was being thrown away in the coal, which was too wasteful, so they took the time to pick out 386 kilograms of copper ore, which could make more than 300 kilograms of sulfuric acid. The workers in the dilute sulfuric acid workshop, on the principle of not hindering production, automatically picked out more than six tons of good iron from the pile of scrap iron that had been unattended for many years and neatly sent it to the warehouse for safekeeping. Now, the workers are actively using their brains to find production secrets to consolidate the victorious achievements of the "Three-Anti" Movement.

    山东制酸厂工人爱护国家财产
    不让一点有用的东西浪费掉
    编辑同志：经过“三反”运动，国营山东制酸厂工人爱护国家财产的观念大大加强了。工人十分爱惜工厂里的东西，一点一滴也不让它浪费掉。触媒班七个工人看到烧锅炉拣出来的铜碛都扔在炭里太可惜了，于是抽出时间，拣出铜碛三百八十六公斤，能制硫酸三百多公斤。稀硫酸车间的工人，在不妨碍生产的原则下，自动从多年没有人管的废铁堆中，拣出六吨多好铁，整整齐齐地送到仓库保管起来。现在，工人们正积极开动脑筋找生产窍门，来巩固“三反”运动的胜利成果。
