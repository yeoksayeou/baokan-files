    Mi County Mazhuang Peasants Warmly Welcome the "Accelerated Literacy Method"
    Li Jicun, Teacher at Chengguan Primary School, Mi County, Henan

    During the winter vacation, we accepted the task assigned to us by the Cultural and Educational Section of the Mi County People's Government to "pilot the accelerated literacy method in rural areas." When we arrived at the experimental site—Hangang Township—and explained our intentions to the masses, a wave of discussions arose. Many people didn't believe they could learn well, saying, "Li Chengcai in our village studied at a private school his whole life, and now he can't even write a letter. Saying we can learn to write letters and read newspapers in a month? No way, not even close! Learning a hundred characters a day is even more impossible!" But many young peasants said, "In the past, no one cared about us laborers. Now the government is trying every means to do good things for us, even coming up with novel ideas for us to go to school and learn to read!" "This method is really good. Tell the township chairman to have the teachers come to our village."

    From these reactions, we clearly saw that the peasants, eager to improve their cultural level, placed great hope in the "accelerated literacy method" and deeply hoped it would succeed. This strengthened our confidence. As for those who doubted and disbelieved, although there were quite a few, this was inevitable because it was a pioneering effort in the countryside, and no success had yet been demonstrated for them to see. But they were not opposed; rather, they were afraid it wouldn't succeed because they had never seen or heard of it before. This shows that as long as we work hard, come up with solutions, overcome difficulties, and achieve results, we will surely gain their support.

    Based on the above situation, we confidently launched our work. First, we sincerely mobilized the village cadres, and as a result, received their enthusiastic support. Then, we convened a meeting of all winter school teachers in the township, explaining the peasants' urgent desire to learn culture after their liberation and how we should satisfy this demand of the masses; and we told them in detail the scientific nature of the "accelerated literacy method" and the reasons for its "acceleration," as well as its effectiveness. After repeated mobilization, the winter school teachers recognized the significance of promoting the "accelerated literacy method" and said very happily, "Let's do it. We'll meet and study together more often in the future. Don't worry, if it works, we'll learn it too!" In this situation, we studied teaching methods, established an organization to pilot the "accelerated literacy method," and determined that Hanzhuang, Mazhuang, and Wansan villages in the township would be pilot sites, with Mazhuang as the focus.

    After the land reform and review struggles, the general level of awareness of the peasants in Mazhuang was relatively high, and their demand for learning culture was very urgent. When we went to Mazhuang, we were warmly welcomed by the village cadres and the peasant masses. They actively helped us find straw and cooking utensils, and they automatically tidied up the classroom, arranging the desks and chairs neatly, waiting with curiosity for us to conduct "accelerated literacy method" teaching. When we expressed our determination to the masses, village representative Li Baoxing and civilian school teacher Li Chenghua also expressed their willingness to learn with the masses and guaranteed to grasp the students' ideological situation and regularly supervise their studies.

    Thanks to the close cooperation of township and village cadres, civilian school teachers, and ourselves in conducting propaganda and mobilization, forty-one people enrolled in the school (including several people from other villages). After the class started, we further told the students about the advantages of the "accelerated literacy method," which enhanced their confidence. After their enthusiasm for learning increased, we immediately told them that to "accelerate," they must establish rules that everyone should abide by.

    "Good, let's make rules..." the students shouted one after another. Under the leadership of the village cadres and activists, after the students' own discussion, they formulated a study plan and system, and proposed "mutual supervision, timely inspection, criticism, and commendation" to ensure the completion of the study plan. At the same time, a class organization was established, a class leader and group leaders were elected, a roll call roster was made, and rules for requesting leave and making up lessons, as well as signals for the start and end of classes, were established. It was like a regular school.

    In the teaching process, in order to maintain their constant enthusiasm for learning, we carefully and promptly carried out ideological mobilization and individual assistance. Township committee member Li Baojin (a Communist Party member) often felt distressed because of the conflict between work and study, saying, "I'm just getting into the swing of learning, and then there's a meeting!" "The work isn't finished, and then it's time for class!" We explained to him that as long as he could seize the time to make up lessons, difficulties could be overcome. And after he finished his work, we patiently gave him individual tutoring. This enabled him to keep up with his studies and do his work well. Meng Zhaoxian (a member of the Peasant Association) was older (forty-five years old) and had a poor memory. When young people could learn more than two hundred characters a day, he was anxious and sweating profusely, unable to recognize even six or seven characters. He began to lose heart. We comforted him, enlightened him, and helped him individually, explaining, "It doesn't matter if you're older. Others learn more, but we just learn slower. In the long run, won't we be the same as them?" With this kind of help, his interest in learning became higher and higher, from recognizing six or seven characters a day to recognizing twenty or thirty characters a day. When everyone learned to read, he only recognized two or three hundred characters, but he said, "You read first! It won't be long before I can read the newspaper too."

    It snowed heavily, but because the students and teachers were in high spirits, learning was not affected in the slightest. When they first came, they were embarrassed to open their mouths when reading and were somewhat "respectful and distant" towards us. But because we were able to closely integrate with them in our lifestyle and take the initiative to chat with them; when class time arrived, we personally walked around the village ringing the bell; if they didn't come or were late, we went to find them ourselves; if anyone was delayed by meetings or had something to do, we gave them make-up lessons; if they didn't learn well, we gave them individual help and comforted them; we helped with village work when there was work to do; in this way, the relationship between us and the students became better and better, and the students' enthusiasm for learning became higher and higher. During the study period, they rarely arrived late or were absent, and they didn't go to the theater or visit relatives. They studied from afternoon until dark, and from evening until late at night. When they were tired of studying, they sang the song "The Accelerated Literacy Method is Good," clapped their hands, took a hard puff of their tobacco pipes, shook themselves, and then started studying again.

    In the learning process, the students displayed a high degree of awareness and initiative. The phonetic symbols were originally scheduled to be learned in a week, but they were completed in three days. The walls, doors, and fields of the village were covered with writing, and the sounds of spelling and speaking words could be heard everywhere. They always carried their books with them and read them when they were free. Student Yang Changlin and his son worked and studied together, teaching and learning from each other. When the reading stage began, they eagerly rushed to read the books. We had originally thought that consolidating the achievements of the reading stage would be the most difficult, but who knew that after they achieved certain results, they became even more energetic, the young people jumping for joy, and the old people unable to close their mouths. For example, Sun Qingshan (a member of the Peasant Association) suddenly ran up to us proudly and said, "Teacher, let me read a passage for you!" Li Chongfa (a member of the Youth League) pointed to the book and said, "Teacher! I understand what this means. Let me tell you a passage!" Xiao Guanglan also squeezed up to us with a dictionary, staring wide-eyed, and said, "Look! I don't recognize this character, but I've looked it up now. It's the '菌' character in 'bacteria'." Lü Lanfang (female, eighteen years old) had never attended school before. After thirty-three days of "accelerated literacy" study, she had learned one thousand and eight characters and was sitting at the door reading the "Women's Three-Character Classic" to the women. When she read the passage: "Clean food and drink, no sickness, kill rats, swat flies," she told everyone that living at home should be clean to reduce illness. Li Zhensong (a member of the Peasants' Association) originally only knew about one hundred characters, but now he has improved to knowing one thousand five hundred and sixty-seven characters. When he read "Qu Yaoli's Experience in Growing Cotton," he said happily: "I can recognize characters, and I also know how to grow cotton well!" He quickly ran to Teacher Wu and said, "Teacher Wu, come and see my cotton this year." Militia Captain Li Baofu originally knew two hundred characters, but now he has improved to recognizing one thousand four hundred and seventy-two characters. When he convenes a meeting of the militia, he can issue the notices himself. His father was very happy to see him make such great progress and said, "Study hard. I'll do more of the work in the fields." On February 18th, two letters from volunteer soldiers arrived in the village, reporting the news of their victory in Korea. Everyone scrambled to read them. Later, Li Zhensong and Sun Qingsong read them aloud to everyone. Everyone clapped and cheered, overjoyed, and immediately pushed Lü Baoxian (a member of the Peasants' Association, who originally knew two hundred characters and now knows one thousand six hundred characters) to write a reply, also reporting the good news of their victory in learning culture. Even Meng Zhaoxian, who had the worst memory, learned three hundred characters; influenced and encouraged by everyone, he is still studying very enthusiastically.

    Elementary school has started, and although we have left, they are still continuing to study with the help of civilian school teachers and have subscribed to seven copies of the Henan Dazhong Bao. As soon as the newspaper arrives, they rush to read it.

    When we left, all the villagers were reluctant to part with us and sent us out of the village for a long distance until we could no longer be seen, and then they went back. After we left, they still often came to us to chat. Some time later, all the villagers lined up in neat rows to come and see us, saying, "Since you left, the masses have had many reactions; the masses in other villages all regret that the 'accelerated literacy class' wasn't held in their village. Why didn't they attend at the time?" Some said, "The people of Mazhuang are lucky!" Finally, they took out seven or eight letters from their waists and said, "Thinking that the county magistrate doesn't know about our achievements! Many of us can write letters now. Today, several of us classmates who can write letters wrote these few letters to the county magistrate. Please teachers, give them to the county magistrate!"

    Although the letters from the students to the county magistrate were written crookedly and there were many homophones, they were already able to use words to express their thoughts and feelings. One female student wrote in her letter:

    "In the past, I didn't know how to read, but now I have attended the accelerated literacy class and learned many characters. If it weren't for the good leadership of the government, how could I see the news of the country and the principles of the revolution? We will never forget the good government."

    泌阳马庄农民热烈欢迎“速成识字法”
    河南泌阳县城关小学教员　李季村
    寒假期间，我们接受了泌阳县人民政府文教科给我们“在农村试行速成识字法”的任务。当我们到达试验地点——韩岗乡向群众表明来意后，一时议论纷纷，许多人不相信能学好，说：“俺庄李成才上了一辈子私学，现在连封信都不会写。说咱学一个月就会写信看报啦，门儿也没有，可是弦也不沾！一天学一百字更办不到！”但也有许多青年农民说：“先时咱这下力人没人管，现在政府百般想法给咱办好事，连上学识字也出些鲜门！”“这方法真好，给乡主席说说叫老师们往咱庄来。”
    从这些反应中，我们清楚地看出农民们为了急于提高自己的文化水平，对“速成识字法”寄予了很大希望，深望它能够成功。这就给我们增强了信心。至于怀疑和不相信的人，虽然也不少，可是这是免不了的，因为这是在农村的创举，还没有办出来个名堂叫他们看看。但他们并不是反对，而是因为从来没有见过或听说过，怕不会成功。这就说明：只要我们努力，想出办法，克服困难，办出成绩，便一定能够得到他们的拥护。
    根据以上的情况，我们满怀信心地展开了工作。首先恳切地去动员乡村干部，结果得到他们的热烈支持。接着我们召集了全乡冬学教师会议，说明农民翻身后迫切要求学习文化和我们应如何满足群众这个要求；并详细地告诉他们“速成识字法”的科学性及其所以“速成”的道理和功效。经过反复的动员，冬学教师们认清了推行“速成识字法”的意义，都非常高兴地说：“办吧，以后多碰头多研究，请放心啦，中了，俺也学学！”在这种情况下，研究了教学法，建立了试行“速成识字法”的组织，确定以该乡韩庄、马庄、万三村为试点，并选定马庄为重点。
    马庄经过土地改革和复查斗争，一般农民的觉悟较高，学习文化的要求十分迫切。我们到马庄去时，受到村干部和农民群众的热烈欢迎，他们积极地帮助我们找铺草和做饭用具，又自动地整理教室，把桌凳摆得整整齐齐，以好奇的心情等待着我们进行“速成识字法”教学。在我们向群众表明决心时，村代表李保兴和民校教师李成华也表示愿和群众一道学习，并保证掌握学员思想情况，经常地督促学员学习。
    由于乡、村干部、民校教师和我们密切配合进行了宣传动员，结果有四十一人入了学（内有外村数人）。开课后，我们更进一步地告诉学员“速成识字法”的优点，增强了他们的信心。在他们学习劲头提高之后，紧接着告诉他们要“速成”，必须订个规矩，大家好好遵守。
    “好，订订………”学员们一个个地喊叫着。在村干部和积极分子的带头下，经过学员自己的讨论，订出了学习计划和制度，并提出“互相督促，及时检查、批评、表扬”，以保证完成学习计划。同时又成立了班级组织，选出了班长和组长，制订了点名册，规定了请假补课制度和上下课的信号。俨然成了一所正规化的学校。
    在教学过程中，为使他们保持经常的学习热情，我们谨慎及时地进行了思想动员和个别帮助的工作。乡委员李保金（共产党员）因工作和学习矛盾，常常苦恼地说：“学习得正有劲哩，又开会啦！”“工作没办完，又上堂啦！”我们就向他说明：只要能抓紧时间补课，困难是可以克服的。并在他工作之后，耐心地给他作个别补课。这样使他的学习一直没有落于人后，工作也作得很好。孟兆贤（农民协会会员）因为年纪大些（四十五岁），记忆力差，当年轻人一天能学二百多字时，他急得满头大汗，连六、七个字还认不清，他有些松劲了。我们便安慰他，启发他，个别帮助他，说明：“年纪大不要紧，人家学得多，咱学得只是慢些，时间长了，不也要和他们一样吗？”他在这样的帮助下，学习兴趣越来越高了，由一天认六、七个字，提高到一天认二、三十个字。当大家学会阅读的时候，他才认得二、三百字，但他却说：“你先看吧！要不了几天我也保险会看报。”
    天下大雪了，由于同学和教师们情绪很高，学习没有受到丝毫的影响。才来时，他们读书时不好意思张嘴，对我们有些“敬而远之”。但由于我们能够在生活作风上和他们密切结合，主动和他们攀谈；上课时间到了，我们亲自在村上转圈摇铃，他们不到或迟到了，我们亲自去找；谁要因开会或有事耽误了学习，我们给他补课，学习得差了，我们进行个别帮助，并安慰他；村上有了工作我们帮助去作；就这样，我们和学员间的感情越来越好，学员们学习的情绪也越来越高了。在学习期间，他们很少迟到和缺席，有戏也不去看，亲戚也不去走，每天从下午一直学到昏黑，晚上一直学到深夜。他们学得倦了，便唱起“速成识字办法好”的歌子，拍一拍巴掌，狠狠地吸一下烟管，抖抖精神就又学起来了。
    在学习当中，学员们发挥了高度的自觉性和积极性。注音符号，原定一星期学完，结果三天就学完了。村上的墙壁上、门板上、野地里，到处都是字迹，到处可以听见拼音说字的声音。他们时刻把书本带在身上，闲了就念。学员杨长林爷俩一起劳动，一起学习，互教互学。阅读阶段开始了，他俩争先恐后地抢书看。我们原先曾想着巩固阅读阶段的成绩是最艰难的，谁知他们在得到一定的成绩之后，都更加有劲，年青的喜得蹦跳，老年的喜得合不上嘴。如孙庆山（农民协会会员）突然跑到我们跟前自豪地说：“老师，我给你念一段吧！”李崇法（青年团员）指着书本说：“老师！这意思我知道了，我给你说一段吧！”萧广兰拿着字典也挤到我们跟前瞪大眼睛说：“您看！这个字我不认得，现在查出来了，是‘细菌’的‘菌’字。”吕兰芳（女，十八岁）原来没上过学，经过三十三天的
    “速成识字”学习，现在已经学会了一千零八个字，并拿着“妇女三字经”坐在门口念给妇女们听。她读到：“饮食净，不生病，灭老鼠，打苍蝇。”一段时，就告诉大家，居家过日子要干净，才能少生病。李振松（农会会员）原来只认识一百字左右，现在提高到认识一千五百六十七个字。当他读到“曲耀离种棉花的经验”时，就很高兴地说：
    “咱会认字，棉花咱也知道咋种着好啦！”又很快地跑到吴老师跟前说：“吴老师，今年你来看看我的棉花。”民兵队长李保甫原识二百字，现已提高到认识一千四百七十二字，召集民兵开会时自己就会下通知了。他父亲见他有了这样大的成绩，就很高兴地说：“好好学吧，地里活我多做点。”二月十八日，村上来了两封志愿军的家信，报告了他们在朝鲜打胜仗的消息，大家争着看，后来由李振松、孙庆松念给大家听，大家拍手叫好，喜得了不得，并当场推吕保贤（农会会员，原识二百字，现识一千六百字）执笔写回信，也报告了他们学文化的胜利消息。就连记忆力最不好的孟兆贤也学会了三百字；因受到大伙的影响及鼓励，他现在依然学得很热火。
    小学开学啦，我们虽然走了，但他们还在民校教师的帮助下继续学习着，并订了七份河南大众报。报纸一到他们就争着念。
    当我们走的时候，全村群众恋恋不舍，把我们送出村子很远直至看不见了，他们才各自回去。我们走了以后，他们还时常来找我们说长道短。过些时以后，全村群众排成整齐的队伍，来看我们，说：“自你们走后，群众反应很多；别村的群众都后悔着‘速成班’没有开在他村，当时为啥不上？”有的说：“人家马庄有福！”最后他们还从腰里掏出七、八封信说：“想着县长不知道我们的成绩吧！我们很多人会写信了。今天我们几个会写信的同学，给县长写了这几封信，请老师们转给县长吧！”
    学员们给县长的信，虽然字写得歪歪斜斜，还有不少的同音字，但是他们已经能够运用文字把自己的思想感情表达出来了。有一位女学员的信上写着：
    “从前我不识字，现在我上了速成识字班，学会的字很多。要不是政府领导的好，我怎能看到国家的新闻和革命的道理？我们永远不忘好政府。”
