To our beloved Chairman Mao: On the occasion of celebrating the festival of the great working people, we want to report to you on the spring planting and production situation of our cooperative this spring, as a congratulatory gift for our celebration of the "May Day" festival.

	Our cooperative was still a mutual aid team last year, and at the end of the year the entire team received an award from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. In order to produce more grain and industrial raw materials to build the motherland and strive for the complete victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, our team has now been organized into an agricultural production cooperative. Now all members of the cooperative are determined to realize the 1952 production increase plan with a high degree of patriotic labor enthusiasm. Cooperative member Lü Anzong’s mother is over sixty years old, and she also participated in manure composting and childcare work this spring; the twelve-year-old girl Xiao Xiu also participated in weeding wheat, composting manure, and pushing water carts. Thanks to the rational use of manpower, the entire cooperative has completed the spring ploughing and planting work on time and has achieved deep ploughing and careful cultivation. In order to overcome the difficulties that weak livestock cannot deep plough, we researched and created a method of "heavy ploughing." The ploughing depth reached seven inches, an average of three fingers deeper than last year's deep ploughing, and it was harrowed five more times and rolled twice more. We started sowing on the day of Qingming Festival, and we finished sowing before April 22. We all adopted excellent varieties such as "Golden Queen" corn, "Bamboo Pole Green" sorghum, "Golden Thread" millet, and "Five Loves" S-character cotton, and we achieved seed soaking and seed mixing. The average base fertilizer application per mu was 2,400 jin, an increase of 400 jin compared to last year. In order to complete the high-yield plan, we also ordered 500 jin of fertilizer powder from the cooperative. Now the wheat seedlings in the field are growing very well, making people happy to see! Our cooperative originally had two and a half waterwheel wells. This year we plan to drill two more stone wells, which are scheduled to be completed in May, so that we can ensure that 50 mu of land is free from drought. In order to expand reproduction, we also used the deposit and loan method to absorb 2,030 jin of grain deposited by cooperative members to add livestock and farm implements. We are also not lagging behind in political and cultural studies. The entire cooperative subscribes to two rural newspapers and one rural production knowledge publication. Our cooperative also has a great happy event, that is, four children have entered elementary school and four young people are attending half-day school. This is a cultural liberation that we have never had since our ancestors.

	Chairman Mao, our cooperative is now discussing the summer production plan. We will celebrate the great "May Day" Labor Day with practical actions such as more weeding, more fertilizer application, more grain production, and helping the families of revolutionary soldiers solve their difficulties.
	Respectfully,
		All members of the Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative, Lüjiazhuang, 14th District, Ju County, Shandong Province

    完成春耕订出夏季生产计划
    亲爱的毛主席：在庆祝伟大劳动人民的节日的时候，我们要向您报告我社今春的春耕生产情况，作为我们庆祝“五一”节的贺礼。
    我社去年还是互助组，年底全组得到中央人民政府农业部的奖励。为了多打粮食，多种工业原料建设祖国和争取抗美援朝的彻底胜利，我组今年已组织成农业生产合作社。现在全体社员都以高度的爱国劳动热情，决心实现一九五二年的增产计划。社员吕安宗的母亲已六十多岁了，今春也参加捣粪，看孩子的工作；十二岁的女孩子小秀也参加了锄麦、捣粪、推水车等工作。由于合理使用人力，全社已按时完成了春耕、春种的工作。并作到了深耕细作。为了克服牲畜弱不能深耕的困难，我们研究创造了“重犁”耕地的办法。耕地深达七寸；平均比去年深耕三指，并且多耙了五遍，多耢了两遍。从清明节我们开始下种，到四月二十二日前我们已下种完了。我们全部采用了“金皇后”玉米，“竹竿青”高粱、“金线子”谷、“五爱”斯字棉等优良品种，并作到了浸种、拌种。每亩地平均已上底粪两千四百斤，比去年增加四百斤。为完成丰产计划，我们又向合作社定购了肥田粉五百斤。现今地里麦苗长得很好，使人看了真是欢喜！我社原有两眼半水车井，今年我们准备再打两眼石井，计划在五月份完成，这样就可保证五十亩地免受旱灾。为了扩大再生产，我们又用存贷办法吸收社员的存粮二千零三十斤添置了牲畜和农具。我们在政治、文化学习上也不落后，全社共订农村报纸两份，农村生产知识一份。我社还有一个大喜事，就是有四个儿童上了小学，四个青年上半日学校，这是我们自祖辈以来没有过的文化翻身。
    毛主席，我社现在正商量作夏季的生产计划。我们用多锄地、多上粪、多打粮食和帮助革命军人家属解决困难的实际行动，来庆祝伟大的“五一”劳动节。敬礼
    山东省莒县十四区吕家庄吕鸿宾
    农业生产合作社全体社员
