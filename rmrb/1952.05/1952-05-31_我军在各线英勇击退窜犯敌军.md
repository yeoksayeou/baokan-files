Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, May 30th. The First Marine Division of the American invading forces, which has been constantly attacked by our army on the western front, again sent a company to infiltrate the Jiryeong-dong area northeast of Panmunjom. This incursion lasted from the late night of the 21st to the morning of the next day. It was resolutely repulsed by our army, with the enemy suffering dozens of casualties. On the morning of the 24th, enemy troops from the same division again infiltrated the Jiryeong-dong and nearby Ilwon-dong areas in small groups, and were forced to retreat after our army killed or wounded fifty of them. In the area west of Cheorwon, on the 21st, the 45th Infantry Division of the American invading forces, under the cover of ten aircraft and four tanks, invaded a high ground held by our army. After being repulsed, they attacked the same location with a reinforced company, but were again repulsed. In these two battles, the enemy suffered 58 casualties. On the same day, in the central front area, the American invading forces deployed more than ninety tanks to shell our army's positions in Gimseong and its southwest, including Chungnyeon Mountain. Our heroic artillery units immediately retaliated with fierce artillery fire, destroying and damaging ten enemy tanks. On the eastern front, our army also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy in battles to repel enemy incursions. On the 24th, an enemy battalion, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on a high ground west of Mundeung-ri. In the two-hour fierce battle, our heroic small number of defending troops repelled the invading enemy with clever tactics, killing or wounding 113 of them.
