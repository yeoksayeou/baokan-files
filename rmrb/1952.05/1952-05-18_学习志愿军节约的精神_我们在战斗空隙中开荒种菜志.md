    Learning from the Volunteer Army's Spirit of Thrift
    We Reclaim Wasteland to Grow Vegetables During Breaks in Combat
    Yang Yaozhong, Cultural Instructor of a Battalion of the Volunteer Army

    The people of the motherland have crossed mountains and rivers to transport large quantities of pork, egg powder, peanuts, dried tofu, and various canned foods to us. When we eat these things, we deeply feel the boundless love of the people of the motherland for us, and therefore think that we should find various ways to reduce the burden on the people of the motherland.

    There is a lot of wasteland near our station. Due to the destruction and slaughter by the American invading army, coupled with the large number of young Korean men and women who have taken up the posts of defending their motherland, these fertile lands do not have enough labor to cultivate. After the battalion leaders asked for instructions from their superiors and consulted with the local Korean people, they mobilized the soldiers to reclaim wasteland to grow vegetables during breaks in combat and training. The soldiers were happy to hear this, and they said: It's really good to save expenses for the motherland and have fresh vegetables to eat ourselves!

    To reclaim wasteland, the first difficulty encountered was the lack of hoes and rakes. What to do? The soldiers said: Let's make them ourselves, don't transport them from the motherland. They gathered all the people who knew how to blacksmith and formed a blacksmithing team. Some people went up the mountain to burn charcoal. Some people picked up a lot of scrap iron discarded by the enemy beside the road. They also made bellows from fried flour boxes. So they set up the stove and started working diligently. At first, without hammers, they used axes to blacksmith. Three days later, they made a complete set of tools used on two blacksmith furnaces—four sledgehammers, two hand hammers, as well as pliers, anvils, and so on, everything was complete. Then they started making production tools. In half a month, they made 180 hoes and 35 rakes. They also repaired the existing picks and shovels. They also made many axes, saws and other tools.

    After making the tools themselves, they immediately launched a vigorous production competition. Many people proposed: Be heroes in combat, and be role models in production.

    学习志愿军节约的精神
    我们在战斗空隙中开荒种菜
    志愿军某部一营文化教员　杨耀中
    祖国人民越过千山万水，给我们运来了大批猪肉、蛋粉、花生米、豆腐干和各种罐头食品。当我们吃着这些东西的时候，我们深深地感到祖国人民对我们的无限热爱，因而想到自己应该想各种办法来减轻祖国人民的负担。
    我们的驻地附近有许多荒地。由于美国侵略军的破坏和屠杀，加上大批朝鲜青年男女走上了保卫祖国的岗位，这些肥沃的土地没有足够的劳动力来开垦。营首长请示了上级并和当地朝鲜人民商量好之后，就发动战士们在战斗、练兵的空隙中开荒种菜。战士们一听就高兴起来了，他们说：给祖国节省费用，自己又有新鲜蔬菜吃，这真好！
    要开荒地，首先碰到的困难是没有锄耙。怎么办呢？战士们说：自己动手造吧，不要到祖国去运。他们把全部会打铁的人集中起来，成立了打铁组。有的人上山去烧木炭。有的人到公路旁边拣到许多敌人遗弃下的废铁。又用炒面箱制成了风箱。于是就安起炉子叮叮当当干起来了。最初没有锤子，就用斧头来打铁。三天之后，打成了两个铁匠炉上所用的全套工具——四个大锤，两个手锤，还有钳子、义子等等，样样俱全。然后就开始做生产工具。半个月功夫，打好了锄头一百八十把、耙子三十五把。又把原有的镐、锹都修理好。还打了许多斧头、锯子等工具。
    自己制造了工具，马上就轰轰烈烈地展开了生产竞赛。许多人提出：在战斗中当英雄，在生产中要当模范。
