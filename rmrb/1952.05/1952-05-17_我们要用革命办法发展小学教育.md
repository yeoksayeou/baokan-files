    We Need to Use Revolutionary Methods to Develop Primary Education
    Guo Lin
    In order to implement the decision of the Government Administration Council on the reform of the school system, the National Primary Education Conference determined that, starting in the autumn of 1952, a five-year consistent primary school system would be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner throughout the country, and efforts should be made to enroll 80 percent of school-age children in the next five years. To complete such a glorious and arduous task, we must not use conservative and traditional methods, but revolutionary methods.
    In terms of running schools in rural areas, the old liberated areas have accumulated many valuable experiences in the past; since the liberation of the country three years ago, we have also gained a lot of experience in running schools in large and medium-sized cities. These experiences are of great reference value for adopting revolutionary methods to develop primary education throughout the country and promoting the five-year consistent system in the future.
    Here are some experiences in running schools in old revolutionary base areas.
    Establish Joint Schools
    In primary schools in smaller villages, where it is difficult to establish fourth and fifth grades independently, joint fourth and fifth grades can be established with nearby villages, and fourth and fifth graders from small villages can attend school in other villages. This will solve the problem of teachers for the higher grades in some primary schools. However, it should be noted that the villages should not be too far apart (no more than four li), and there should be no rivers in between, so that students can travel conveniently and avoid danger; at the same time, school buildings and equipment should be properly resolved. The general method is: the village where the school is located builds the school building; the village where the school is located pays more, and other villages pay less.
    Run Non-Regular Classes
    In order to enable the children of workers and peasants who are economically difficult, have little time, and are older to attend school, appropriate study time should be found according to the students' production situation, and "non-regular classes" (the name can be considered) such as night classes, noon classes, morning classes, half-day classes, and alternate-day classes should be established, so as to ensure that production and study are not delayed.
    The issue of teachers for "non-regular classes" can be solved by hiring full-time, semi-voluntary, and part-time teachers. Whether full-time or part-time, there should be a certain amount of remuneration. These classes should also have a certain system, such as roll call, leave of absence, review, and exams, to ensure a certain learning effect. In "non-regular classes", students should not only be organized to study, but also organized to produce. For example, organize mutual aid in hoeing, taking turns taking care of children, and herding cattle. Good production organization creates favorable conditions for learning.
    "Non-regular classes" must develop a teaching plan. In terms of teaching time, production must be taken into account. It should be shortened during busy farming seasons and appropriately extended during the winter slack season. In addition to half-day classes and alternate-day classes, the general teaching of night schools, morning classes, and noon classes should not exceed 60 minutes for the first and second grades, and each session should complete a certain amount of teaching material. The third, fourth, and fifth grades are limited to 90 minutes and can be divided into two sessions. In terms of courses, the main ones are Chinese and arithmetic. The start and end of school are generally the same as regular classes. Non-regular classes should adopt a subject-based graduation method. For example, a primary school Chinese graduation certificate will be issued if the Chinese subject exam is passed, and a primary school graduation certificate will be issued if all subject exams are passed. In terms of teaching methods, classroom teaching should be the main focus, but students should also be organized and supervised to review and practice during production gaps. The make-up class system must be strictly enforced for students who are absent.
    Run All-Inclusive Primary Schools
    In scattered mountainous areas, where the villages are small and there are not many school-age children, but the masses actively demand schooling, it is best to run all-inclusive primary schools. In this way, a teacher is responsible for both the teaching of children and the teaching of adults and young people. The organizational form of teaching can be diverse, such as full-day classes, half-day classes, and night classes.
    Adopt the Method of Specialist Teachers Teaching Part-Time
    Promoting the five-year consistent system, the difficulty of teachers in the fourth and fifth grades of primary schools must first be felt. Especially in rural primary schools, it is difficult to find specialist teachers who can teach history, geography, nature, music, physical education, and drawing. At the same time, primary schools with fewer classes do not need a teacher for each specialist subject. Therefore, a specialist teacher can teach part-time in several nearby primary schools. However, attention must be paid to the teacher's time and energy, and teaching tasks should be appropriately distributed to prevent teachers from missing classes or being perfunctory due to too much part-time teaching, or affecting their health due to being too busy and tired.
    Massive Short-Term Teacher Training Classes
    Liberated peasants urgently request to send their children to school, and the need for teachers in rural areas will increase significantly in the next few years. Therefore, it is necessary to universally run short-term teacher training classes to absorb intellectuals in the countryside and some older and better-educated senior primary school graduates, and provide them with short-term training in politics and professional skills, and assign them as primary school teachers.
    Rely on the Masses to Solve the Problem of School Buildings and Equipment
    According to the survey materials of 53 counties under the six special districts of Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Tongxian, Dingxian, Tianjin, and Tangshan in Hebei Province, in the first half of 1951, relying on the masses, 7,321 new school buildings were built, 19,036 old houses were repaired, 16,571 zhang of walls were built, 6,227 doors and windows were added, 43,642 sets of desks and chairs were made, and 3,594 blackboards were made. The total amount of the six items is 86.682 billion yuan, accounting for 96.33 percent of the total repair and purchase cost in the first half of the year (the repair and purchase cost paid by the county people's government accounts for 2.86 percent, and the repair and purchase cost paid by the collection of miscellaneous fees accounts for 0.81 percent). This shows that the problem of school buildings and equipment can be solved by relying on the masses. In order to rely on the masses to build school buildings and add equipment, the enthusiasm of the masses and village cadres for running schools must first be stimulated. In addition, in the process of mobilizing the masses to carry out this work, if the masses encounter difficulties, they must be helped to solve them, and a small amount of subsidies should be given when necessary, which is very helpful in boosting the morale of the masses.
    Secondly, I would like to introduce some experiences in running schools in large and medium-sized cities using revolutionary methods:
    Adopt a Two-Shift System
    The biggest problem in developing primary education in large and medium-sized cities is the difficulty of school buildings. Because the population of cities is increasing day by day, there are never enough houses. Therefore, at present, 30 to 50 percent of school-age children in major and medium-sized cities are still out of school. The vast majority of these out-of-school children are children of workers and peasants. A better way to solve this problem is to adopt a two-shift system. The experience of Northeast China, Xi'an, Beijing, and Tianjin in the past two years has proven that the two-shift system is one of the most effective ways to solve the problem of school buildings and children out of school in cities. Especially in the current situation where the country's financial and economic situation is still difficult, and it is impossible to take out a large amount of funds to build school buildings, and the children of workers and peasants are urgently requesting to attend school, it is very necessary for us to adopt a two-shift system. Even in the next few years, it is necessary to promote the two-shift system universally in major and medium-sized cities.
    To promote the two-shift system, two problems must first be solved: (1) Many primary school teachers in the lower grades today are responsible for one class, and are busy participating in learning and social activities, which is already tiring enough. If the two-shift system is implemented without increasing teachers, it will increase their burden, and they are often unwilling and in fact have difficulties. Therefore, a certain number of teachers must be added, and the time of teachers and students must be taken into account when arranging the timetable, staggering the Chinese, arithmetic, music, and physical education classes, and paying attention to the teaching effect. (2) Many parents do not understand what the two-shift system is and why it should be adopted. Some people think, "This won't work, what can you learn in half a day!" Some people say, "This won't work, the child will make a lot of noise at home for half a day." Therefore, we must tell them: It is of course good to study at school for a whole day, but there are still many children of workers and peasants who do not even have the opportunity to study for half a day. At the same time, we must tell them: Experience in various places has proven that as long as teachers are added and teaching is improved, the learning effect of half a day is not bad. Although the time for classroom teaching is reduced, homework and extracurricular activities can still be carried out in a planned and organized manner. As long as we fully publicize and explain to parents through teachers and students, using various opportunities, it is not difficult to promote the two-shift system.
    Establish Schools in Accordance With Local Conditions and Adopt the Principle of Taking Into Account Both Public and Private Interests
    In industrial central areas and working people's residential areas, more municipal primary schools should be added, and factories should be mobilized to run schools. In commercial central areas, trade associations should be mobilized to run schools, and private schooling should be encouraged. Why should we do this? Because there have always been few schools in industrial areas and working people's residential areas, and it is difficult for workers' children and poor children to pay tuition fees. The government should add schools in these areas and mobilize larger factories to build schools to enroll the children of employees. In the past, there were more schools in commercial central areas, and merchants' children had money to pay tuition fees, so private primary schools can be developed more. Tianjin has relatively mature experience in developing private primary schools:
    First, it is easier for trade associations to solve funding problems than private schools, so the schools that are run are more solid.
    Second, pay attention to improving the board of directors. In the past, the boards of directors of private primary schools were mostly unsound and ineffective. Therefore, Tianjin first drafted the organizational methods of the board of directors and helped various schools reorganize their boards of directors. The new board of directors plays a great role in solving the financial difficulties of the school and building equipment. Such private primary schools can develop solidly.
    Third, the government should encourage private schooling and encourage those who donate funds to build schools.
    For schools that have already been established privately, the best way to encourage them is to allow them to be registered, give private primary schools a legal status, so that they can concentrate on doing a good job in the people's education. At the same time, rectify and transform private primary schools through registration work. The steps to be taken are to propose registration conditions, determine the three standards of registration (meeting government requirements), filing (roughly meeting requirements but still insufficient), and registration (the worst), based on the situation of private primary schools. Then, according to the conditions, organize cadres to understand and review, and announce the results in the newspaper after approval by the municipal government. The result of Tianjin's approach has greatly encouraged those who run private schools, and the understanding and work enthusiasm of teachers and staff have also improved.
    Fourth, leadership must be strengthened for private primary schools to be consolidated and developed. To this end, the leaders must first understand the situation of private primary schools, conduct inspections and research in a planned manner, help them solve some problems, and strengthen guidance in business. It is best to select politically strong cadres to help private primary schools carry out transformation work from ideological and organizational aspects. When necessary, they can be subsidized with a certain amount of funds to help solve problems such as teachers and teaching materials. Unified Enrollment and Adjustment of Classes
    Several major cities in East China, such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, have better experience in this regard. For example, Hangzhou found that there were abnormal phenomena in the class size of primary schools: the number of students in public primary school classes was crowded, while the number of students in private primary school classes was insufficient; therefore, private primary schools competed to recruit students, resulting in both sides not being able to recruit enough students, resulting in too many composite grades. This increased the teaching difficulties in classes with too many students, and caused waste in classes with too few students. After studying this situation, the leaders proposed a plan for "filling enrollment, adjusting classes, and unified enrollment" in the second half of 1951. The plan determined: Taking the district as a unit, the classes of the same level in each school should be merged in a planned manner under the condition that the number of students can be merged, the composite grades should be merged into single grades, or the classes with too few students should be merged into composite grades, and a grade should be vacated to recruit new students. At the same time, enroll students in a planned manner to supplement enrollment and prevent the increase of composite grades. According to the results of the adjustment based on this plan, according to incomplete statistics: 29 composite grades and 3 single grades were reduced in various schools in the city, and 35 single grades were increased. Therefore, the number of students in general schools has generally increased, and the number of students in Xianlinqiao Yinmajing District 2 alone has increased by 553. The tuition fee situation of private primary schools has also improved. For example, the tuition fees in Xianlinqiao District 1 increased by 7,399 units.
    The specific steps of this work are as follows:
    First, investigate the class size, number of students (including students in school and new students preparing to take the exam), etc. of each school in the district, formulate adjustment and enrollment plans, and exchange adjustment opinions with the principals of each school in advance.
    Second, organize various meetings, conduct deliberation within and between schools, and mobilize and persuade teachers.
    Third, mobilize parents through home visits, parent meetings, etc. In addition, students should also be mobilized.
    Fourth, according to the enrollment and adjustment plans and the results of consultation, each school exchanges student rosters, and welcome and farewell parties can be held for the students who are being adjusted.
    Of course, different methods should be adopted according to different conditions when carrying out this work, but the main thing is to do a good job in mobilization and persuasion, so that parents, teachers, and students can be willing.
    They encountered many difficulties in the course of their work. For example, teachers in private primary schools were afraid that transferring students would affect their own treatment, class teachers were unwilling to transfer their own students, and some were afraid of transferring senior students. The school was afraid that the school scale would be reduced, and if the number of people was reduced, it would affect the fees. Parents were unwilling to let their children go to private primary schools, fearing that it would increase tuition fees, fearing that it would be inconvenient to transfer to a distant place, and those with several children in the same school were afraid that it would be inconvenient to transfer them away. These difficulties and concerns were appropriately resolved after research and persuasion. For example, parents were afraid of increasing the burden, so it was stipulated that no matter which school they transferred to, the fees would be paid according to the standard of the previous semester in principle, without increasing the burden. Appropriate care must be given to brothers and sisters who do not want to be transferred away from the same school. Private primary schools are afraid that the number of students will decrease, which will affect the fees. When assigning students, they should try their best to transfer those who can afford tuition fees to private primary schools, and ensure that the number of people will only increase and not decrease.
    Solving the Problem of Teachers in Urban Primary Schools
    Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, pointed out in the summary report of the National Primary Education and Normal Education Conference that the work of training teachers in the next three to five years should focus on short-term training, and at the same time, normal schools should be well-run. He also pointed out that the sources of teachers for short-term training are, on the one hand, to absorb and mobilize unemployed intellectuals and housewives with knowledge as much as possible to receive training; on the other hand, to select outstanding teachers from existing school teachers, train them, and upgrade them level by level. This points out a clear direction for us to solve the problem of urban teachers. The target of urban teacher training is different from that of rural areas. Generally, senior primary school graduates are around 12 years old and cannot be used as training targets; due to the needs of national construction in various aspects, many unemployed intellectuals have already joined the work, and the number of those left is not many; however, there are still many housewives with knowledge who have not participated in the work, and their awareness is gradually increasing, and they are demanding to come out to work. The Bureau of Culture and Education of the Shanghai and Nanjing Municipal People's Governments has mobilized many housewives with knowledge through the Democratic Women's Federation, gave them short-term training, and assigned them as primary school teachers. At the same time, they also trained the first, second, and third grade primary school teachers in service and promoted them to be fourth and fifth grade teachers.

    我们用革命办法发展小学教育
    郭林
    为了执行政务院关于学制改革的决定，全国初等教育会议确定自一九五二年秋季开始在全国范围内有计划地、有步骤地推行小学五年一贯制，要在今后五年内争取百分之八十的学龄儿童入学。要完成这样一个光荣而艰巨的任务，就不能用保守的传统的办法，而必须用革命的办法。
    在农村办学方面，过去老解放区曾积累了许多宝贵的经验；全国解放三年以来，我们在大中城市办学方面，也取得不少的经验。这些经验对于今后采用革命办法发展全国的初等教育和推行五年一贯制，是大有参考价值的。
    这里首先介绍几点老区农村办学的经验。
    成立联合学校
    在较小村庄的小学里，在单独成立四、五年级比较困难的情况下，可以和附近几个村子联合成立四、五年级，小村的四、五年级生出村就学。这样就能够解决一部分小学高年级的师资问题。但要注意村子和村子不要相距太远（不超过四里），不要隔河，务使学生往来便利，免得发生危险；同时要适当地解决校舍和设备问题。一般的办法是：由学校所在村修建校舍；经费由学校所在村多出，他村少出。
    举办非正规班
    为了使经济困难、时间少、年纪大的工农子女能够入学，应根据学生的生产情况，找出适当的学习时间，成立夜班、午班、早班、半日班、隔日班等等的“非正规班”（名称可以考虑），以便做到生产学习两不误。
    “非正规班”的师资问题，可采取聘请专职、半义务职、兼职等办法去解决。无论专职或兼职，都要有一定的酬劳。这种班次也应有一定的制度，如点名、请假、复习、考试等，以保证一定的学习效果。在“非正规班”里，不仅要组织学生学习，还要组织他们生产。如组织拨工互助、轮流看孩子、看牛等。生产组织得好，就给学习创造了有利条件。
    “非正规班”必须订定教学计划。在教学时间方面，一定要照顾到生产，农忙时缩短，冬闲时酌情延长。除半日班、隔日班等另行规定外，一般夜校、早班和午班教学，一、二年级每次不得超过六十分钟，每节要授完一定教材。三、四、五年级以九十分钟为限，可分两节教学。在课程方面，主要是国语和算术。开学、放假一般和正规班同。非正规班要采取分科结业方式，如国语科考试及格即发小学国语结业证，各科考试都及格，再发给小学毕业证书。在教法方面，应以课堂教学为主，但也应组织和督促学生利用生产空隙进行温课和练习。对缺课的学生，一定要坚持执行补课制度。
    办一揽子小学
    在分散的山区，村子小，学龄儿童不多，但群众积极要求办学的情况下，最好办一揽子小学。这样，一个教师既负责儿童的教学，也负责成人、青年的教学。教学的组织形式可以是多种多样的，如整日班、半日班、夜班等。
    采用专科教师兼课办法
    推行五年一贯制，首先要感到小学四、五年级师资的困难。尤其是在农村小学里，能够教历史、地理、自然、音乐、体育、图画等的专科教员是很难找到的。同时班次少的小学，也不需要一个专科设一个教员。因此一个专科教员可以兼附近几个小学的课。但一定要注意教师的时间和精力，适当地分配教学任务，防止教员因兼课过多以致发生误课或敷衍应付的现象，或因忙累而影响健康的现象。
    大量开办短期师资训练班
    翻身农民迫切要求送子女入学，今后数年内农村的师资需要大量增加。因此需要普遍地开办短期师资训练班，来吸收在乡知识分子和一部分年龄较大、程度较好的高小毕业生，在政治上、业务上加以短期训练，分配作小学教师。
    依靠群众解决校舍和设备的问题
    根据河北省石家庄、衡水、通县、定县、天津、唐山六个专区所属的五十三个县的调查材料，在一九五一年上半年，依靠群众盖了新的校舍七千三百二十一间，修理旧房一万九千零三十六间，筑围墙一万六千五百七十一丈，添门窗六千二百二十七个，制桌凳四万三千六百四十二套，黑板三千五百九十四块。六项合计折款共八百六十六亿八千二百万元，占上半年修购费总数的百分之九十六·三三（由县人民政府支付的修购费占百分之二·八六，由征收杂费支付的占百分之○·八一）。这就说明，校舍和设备的问题，是可以依靠群众来解决的。为了依靠群众修建校舍，添置设备，首先要激发群众和村干部办学的热情。另外，在发动群众进行这一工作的过程中，群众碰到了困难，就必须帮助解决，必要时要作少许的补助，这对鼓舞群众的情绪是很有作用的。
    其次，再介绍大、中城市用革命办法办学的几点经验：
    采用二部制
    大、中城市发展小学教育的最大问题是校舍困难。因为城市人口一天一天地增加，房屋总是不够用。因此，目前各大、中城市，尚有百分之三十到百分之五十的失学儿童。这些失学儿童绝大部分是工农子女。解决这一问题的较好办法是采用二部制。两年来东北、西安、北京、天津各地的经验证明采用二部制是解决城市校舍问题和儿童失学问题最有效的办法之一。尤其是在目前国家的财政经济尚有困难、不可能拿出大量款项建筑校舍、而工农子女又迫切要求入学的情况下，我们采用二部制，是十分必要的。就是在今后若干年内，也需要在各大、中城市，普遍地推广二部制。
    推行二部制，首先要解决两个问题：（一）今天许多小学的低年级教师，都是一个人包办一个班，又忙于参加学习和社会活动，已经够累了。如果实行二部制，而不增加教员，会更加重他们的负担，他们往往不乐意，事实上也有困难。所以必须增添一定数量的教师，在编排课程表时还要照顾到教师和学生的时间，把国语、算术和音乐、体育等课错开，注意教学效果。（二）不少的家长不了解什么是二部制，为什么要采用它。有的认为“这不行，半天能学啥！”有的说：“这可不行，孩子在家半天可闹死人。”因此，我们要告诉他们：在学校念一天固然好，可是还有许多的工农子女连念半天的机会也没有。同时要告诉他们：各地经验证明，只要增添教员，改进教学，半天的学习效果也并不坏。因为课堂教学的时间虽然减少些，但课外作业和课外活动，还是可以有计划有组织地去进行。只要我们通过教师和学生，利用各种机会，充分地向家长进行宣传解释，推行二部制是不困难的。
    因地制宜，并采用公私兼顾的原则
    设立学校
    在工业中心区、劳动人民聚居区，应多添办市立小学，并发动工厂办学。商业中心区，则应发动同业公会办学，并奖励私人兴学。为什么要这样作呢？因为工业区、劳动人民聚居区，向来学校很少，工人子女、贫苦儿童，缴纳学费又都有困难。政府应该在这些地方添办学校，同时发动规模较大的工厂建校，吸收职工子女入学。商业中心区过去学校较多，商人子女都有钱缴纳学费，故可以多发展私立小学。天津市在发展私立小学方面，有比较成熟的经验：
    第一，发动同业公会办学比私人办学容易解决经费问题，因而办起来的学校也就比较巩固。
    第二，注意健全校董会。过去私立小学的校董会，多是不健全、不起作用的。因而天津市就首先草拟了董事会组织办法，并帮助各校改组了校董会。新的校董会对解决学校的经费困难和修建设备问题，都起很大的作用。这样的私立小学就能巩固地发展。
    第三，政府要鼓励私人兴学，对捐资兴学的人士应给予鼓励。
    对于已有的私人设立的学校，最好鼓励方式是准予立案，给私立小学以合法地位，使他们能安心搞好人民教育事业。同时通过立案工作对私立小学进行整顿改造。进行的步骤是根据私立小学的情况，提出立案条件，确定立案（合乎政府要求的）、备案（大约合乎要求但还有不够的地方）和登记、
    （最差的）三个标准。然后根据条件，组织干部进行了解、审查，经市府批准后在报上公布结果。天津市这样做的结果，大大鼓舞了兴办私立学校的人，教职员的认识和工作积极性也提高了一步。
    第四，对私立小学必须加强领导才能使之巩固和发展。为此领导方面首先要了解私立小学的情况，有计划地进行视导研究，帮助它们解决一些问题，并在业务上加强指导。最好选派政治坚强的干部去帮助私立小学从思想上组织上进行改造工作。必要时，可补助他们一定数量的经费，帮助解决教师、教材等问题。统一招生和调整班级
    华东的几个大城市如上海、杭州等地，在这方面有较好的经验。例如杭州市发现小学学级编制有不正常的现象：公立小学学级人数拥挤，私立小学学级则人数不足；因而私立小学竞收学生，结果弄得两方面都招不足，造成复式学级过多的现象。这就使人数过多的学级增加了教学困难，而学级人数过少的，则造成浪费现象。领导方面研究了这种情况之后，在一九五一年下期提出了“充实学额、调整班级、统一招生”的计划。计划确定：以区为单位有计划地把各校同等程度的学级在学生数可以合并的条件下进行合并，把复式并为单式，或把人数过少的学级并为复式，腾出一级招收新生。同时有计划地招生，以补充学额，并防止复式学级的增加。根据这一计划调整的结果，据不完全统计：全市各校减少了二十九个复式，三个单级，增加单式三十五个。因而，一般学校学生普遍增加，仅仙林桥饮马井二区即增加学生五百五十三人。私立小学收费情况也好转，如仙林桥一区增收学费七千三百九十九个单位。
    这一工作的具体步骤如下：
    首先，调查全区各校学级编制、学生数（包括在校学生和准备投考的新生）等情况，拟定调整和招生计划，和各校校长先行交换调整意见。
    第二，组织各种会议，在校内校际进行酝酿，并向老师进行动员说服工作。
    第三，通过家庭访问、家长会等方式，动员家长。另外，也要动员学生。
    第四，根据招生和调整计划及协商结果，各校交换学生名册，对被调整的学生可举行欢迎欢送会。
    进行这一工作，当然要根据不同条件，采用不同的方法，但主要地是要做好动员说服工作，让家长、老师和学生都能出于自愿。
    他们在工作进行中曾遇到了不少的困难。如私立小学的老师怕把学生调走，影响本身待遇，级任老师不愿把自己的学生调出去，有的怕把高级学生调走。学校方面恐怕学校规模缩小，并且调进调出，如果人数减少，会影响收费。家长方面不愿让子女到私立小学去读，怕增加学费，怕调到远的地方不方便，有几个孩子同在一个学校里的，怕调开不方便。这些困难和顾虑，经过研究，进行说服，都适当地得到了解决。如家长怕增加负担，就规定不管调到那校，原则上照上学期标准缴费，不增加负担。兄弟姊妹同校不愿调开的，就一定给以适当照顾。私立小学怕学生减少，影响收费，在分配学生时，就尽量注意把能纳得起学费的调到私立小学，而且保证人数只增加不减少。
    解决城市小学的师资问题
    中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长在全国初等教育及师范教育会议总结报告中指出，今后三五年内培养师资的工作应以短期训练为重点，同时也要办好正规的师范学校。他又指出进行短期训练的师资的来源，一方面是尽一切可能吸收和动员失业知识分子和家庭知识妇女受训；另一方面从现有的学校教师中，选其优秀者加以训练，逐级提升。这就给我们解决城市师资问题指出了明确的方向。城市培养师资的对象，和乡村的情况又不同。一般高小毕业生年龄都在十二岁左右，不能作为训练的对象；失业的知识分子由于国家建设各方面的需要，许多人已经参加工作，剩下来的为数已经不多；但知识妇女未参加工作者尚有不少，而且她们的觉悟逐渐提高，要求出来工作。上海、南京市人民政府的文教局曾通过民主妇女联合会，动员了不少的家庭知识妇女，施以短期训练，分配作小学教师。同时他们还把在职的一、二、三年级的小学教师，加以训练，提拔作四、五年级的教师。
