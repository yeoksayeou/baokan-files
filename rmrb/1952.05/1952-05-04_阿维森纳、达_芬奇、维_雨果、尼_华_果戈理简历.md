In the evening, a commemorative gala will be held, featuring Gogol's famous play "The Government Inspector" and a recitation of Hugo's famous poems. A commemorative exhibition of the four figures will also open on the same day. The biographies of Avicenna, Da Vinci, Hugo, and Gogol are as follows:

    Avicenna

    Avicenna was a great physician, poet, and philosopher of Central Asia in the 11th century. He was born in 980 AD in the village of Afushan near Bukhara in Central Asia (within the territory of the present-day Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic). He was of Tajik ethnicity. He died in 1037. According to the Islamic calendar, his birth this year marks the 1000th anniversary.

    Avicenna's era was a period of flourishing Arab culture. Bukhara was one of the centers of cultural life at that time. By the age of ten, Avicenna was well-versed in Arabic and Persian literature. By seventeen, he had become a renowned physician and scholar. He often treated the poor and discovered several new medical methods. Because he cured several kings of serious illnesses, he was praised and appointed as a minister. Due to the jealousy of some courtiers, he also suffered political setbacks and was even imprisoned. However, Avicenna worked diligently in any environment, seeking ways for mankind to conquer nature.

    Avicenna was extremely knowledgeable. In addition to medicine, he was also proficient in logic, philosophy, and geometry. He wrote over a hundred books. The most important of these is "The Canon of Medicine." This book is divided into five volumes: physiology, pathology, hygiene (volumes one and two), diagnostic methods (volumes three and four), and pharmacology (volume five). He earned the title of "King of Medicine" for this work. Arab medicine was more advanced than European medicine in the Middle Ages. From the 12th to the 17th centuries, Avicenna's work served as the basis for medical research in European universities and was translated into many languages.

    Avicenna's writings also contain his unique insights in philosophy, astronomy, geology, and chemistry. He strived to prevent science from becoming a slave to religion, studying natural phenomena according to the true face of nature. The anti-scientific astrology and alchemy prevalent at the time were criticized and ridiculed by Avicenna. Avicenna expressed a tendency towards materialism in his own unique form.

    Da Vinci

    Leonardo da Vinci was a great painter, writer, thinker, and scientist of 15th-century Italy. He was born on April 15, 1452, and this year marks the full 500th anniversary.

    Da Vinci was one of the giants of the Renaissance. His genius was multifaceted. His talent was first and foremost powerfully expressed in art. In his childhood, he enjoyed painting, sculpting, and music. At the age of eighteen, he entered the studio of Verrocchio to study painting. After leaving the studio in 1477, he served as a painter and director of the Academy of Fine Arts at the court of the Duke of Milan for many years. During this period, he created many famous works of art, such as the "Bronze Statue of Francesco Sforza" and "The Last Supper." "The Last Supper," which depicts the scene of Jesus' last supper with his disciples before his death, took three years to complete and is an immortal masterpiece. From December 1499 to 1506, Da Vinci led his students away from Milan to travel to Venice, Florence, and various cities in central Italy. During this period, his famous works included "Mona Lisa," etc.

    Da Vinci was an enthusiastic seeker of knowledge. In science, he was proficient in anatomy, physiology, physics, mathematics, geology, astronomy... He enthusiastically studied every branch of theoretical and applied science in his time, using observation and experimentation, and he was the first to begin studying some of these fields. In many respects, his research achievements far surpassed those of his contemporaries. He was also the greatest and most successful architect and engineer of his time. His architectural and engineering plans were bold, progressive, and possessed an amazing spirit.

    Victor Hugo

    Victor Hugo was a great democratic writer—poet, novelist, and playwright—of 19th-century France. He was born on February 26, 1802, in Besançon, eastern France, and this year marks the 150th anniversary.

    Hugo began writing poetry and plays from his youth. He declared a break with classical traditions with his early plays "Cromwell" and "Hernani." The performance of "Hernani" became a demonstration of the victory of the emerging Romantic literary movement.

    After the French Revolution of 1830, Hugo completely abandoned the royalist ideas he had been influenced by in his youth. In 1831, he wrote the famous "Notre-Dame de Paris," which sympathetically depicts the heroic struggle of the French people against oppression in the 15th century. In 1834, he published the novel "Claude Gueux," which depicts the tragic life of a worker and his family.

    During the French February Revolution of 1848, when the bourgeoisie were frightened by the tremors of the revolution and openly took the path of reaction, Hugo declared himself a republican. He was elected as a member of the Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly after the revolution. He waged a sharp struggle against the reactionaries in the parliament and was therefore hated by the reactionaries.

    After Napoleon III declared himself emperor in 1851, Hugo was forced to go into exile abroad for opposing the imperial regime, and did not return to his homeland until the collapse of Napoleon III's empire in 1870. During his nineteen years of exile, he created his most important novels: "Les Misérables," "The Toilers of the Sea," and "The Man Who Laughs," etc. In these works, Hugo expressed his fervent sympathy for the despised and oppressed.

    In 1871, the Paris working class established the Paris Commune. Although Hugo did not participate in this movement, after the failure of the Paris Commune, he resolutely protected the Communards, saving them from the persecution of the reactionary bourgeoisie of France at that time.

    Hugo extremely hated national oppression and sympathized with the struggles of oppressed nations. He cared about the fate of black slaves in the Americas; he praised the struggle of the Greeks against Turkish rule; he advised the soldiers of the Tsarist Russian army not to "serve tyranny" and oppose the Polish people; he encouraged Mexican patriots to defend their homeland and resist the French expeditionary force sent by Napoleon III; he voiced support for Irish patriots sentenced to death by British law; he encouraged the Cuban people to revolt against Spanish rule. In 1860, when the Anglo-French Allied Forces captured Beijing, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace, Hugo also made a righteous exposure and protest against this act of robbery. In August 1849, an international "Friends of Peace" conference was held in Paris. Hugo was elected as chairman, and in his passionate speech he said: "The idea of world peace is the property of all nations, and they demand peace as they demand the highest happiness. Reason will eventually replace war... I not only declare that world peace can be achieved, but I also say that it is inevitable."

    Hugo passed away on May 22, 1885. Tens of thousands of people, playing the "Marseillaise," attended the funeral of this great democratic and humanitarian writer to pay their respects to him.

    Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol

    Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol was a great Russian writer of the 19th century. He was born on April 1, 1809, in the Poltava province of southern Russia; he died on March 4, 1852, and this year marks the 100th anniversary of his death.

    Gogol's literary activity unfolded in the 1830s and 1840s. During this period, the Tsarist government, frightened by the Decembrist uprising, brutally suppressed any expression of free thought. However, Russia's advanced cultural circles still strived to promote democratic ideas in the fields of literature, music, drama, painting, and philosophy. Gogol's creation developed and matured under these conditions.

    In his early years, Gogol held a small position in the Tsarist government offices in St. Petersburg. Here he saw that officials of the Tsarist government, from top to bottom, were stealing state property, treating their positions as a source of wealth. Thus, Gogol abandoned his position in the government agencies and devoted himself to writing. He met Pushkin and Zhukovsky, and received great encouragement and help from Pushkin. He wrote many short stories and novellas describing Ukraine. In 1835, his famous drama "The Government Inspector" was published. Because this play criticized the crimes of the Tsarist autocratic government and exposed the disorder and darkness of Russian serf society at that time, the author was persecuted by the ruling class after the performance, and in 1836 he went into exile abroad, settling in Rome in 1837.

    In 1842, Gogol published his masterpiece "Dead Souls." This novel vividly depicts the absurd and decadent lives of Russian landlords and bureaucrats at that time, becoming a powerful weapon for revolutionary fighters to strike at the nobility, bureaucrats, and landlord regime.

    Gogol occupies an extremely important position in the history of Russian literature. He is on par with Pushkin. He is the founder of critical realism in Russian literature. He gave Russian literature new content, making it truthfully reflect life. Belinsky said that he was a "great genius, wise poet, and first-rate writer of contemporary Russia"; Chernyshevsky said that he was the greatest Russian writer. Lenin and Stalin also had high praise for Gogol, often quoting his satirical images to expose the faces of the enemy.

    Gogol's works have been translated into various languages of the world and have become widely read. This shows that Gogol's rich legacy has become a common wealth for all mankind.

    阿维森纳、达·芬奇、维·雨果、尼·华·果戈理简历
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中苏友好协会总会、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会、中华全国科学技术普及协会、中国红十字会总会、中华医学会总会七团体为了响应世界和平理事会的号召加强各国人民的文化交流，定于五月四日下午在北京隆重地联合举行阿维森纳诞生一千周年、达·芬奇诞生五百周年、雨果诞生一百五十周年、果戈理逝世一百周年纪念大会；晚上举行四人纪念晚会，演出果戈理名剧“巡按”和朗诵雨果名诗。四人纪念展览会，也在同日开幕。阿维森纳、达·芬奇、雨果、果戈理四人的简历如下。
    阿维森纳
    阿维森纳是十一世纪中亚细亚的大医学家、诗人、哲学家。他在公元九八○年生于中亚细亚布哈拉附近阿富山村（在现在的乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国境内），他是塔吉克族的人。他死在一○三七年。按回历计算，他的生辰到今年正满一千周年。
    阿维森纳的时代是阿剌伯文化繁盛的时期。布哈拉在那时是文化生活的中心之一。阿维森纳在十岁时已熟知阿剌伯和波斯文学。十七岁时，阿维森纳已成为有名的医师和学者。他常为穷人治病，发现了若干新的医疗方法。因为他给若干国王治好了危病，得到称赏，被任命为大臣。由于部分朝臣的嫉恨，他也遭受过政治上的挫折，甚至被投入狱中。但阿维森纳在任何环境下都勤勉地工作，为人类寻找征服自然的道路。
    阿维森纳的学问极为渊博。除医学外，他还精通逻辑学、哲学、几何学。他的著作共有一百余种。其中最重要的是“医典”。此书共分生理学、病理学、卫生学（第一、二卷）、诊断方法（第三、四卷）及药物学（第五卷）五卷。他因此著而获得了“医中之王”的称衔。阿剌伯医学在中世纪要比欧洲医学高明。从十二世纪至十七世纪，阿维森纳的这部著作曾成为欧洲各大学研究医学的基础，并译成为多种文字。
    阿维森纳的著作中还包含着他在哲学、天文学、地质学、化学各方面独到的见解。他努力使科学不成为宗教的奴仆，按照自然界的真实面目来研究自然现象。当时流行的反科学的星相学与炼丹术受到阿维森纳的抨击和嘲笑。阿维森纳用他自己的独特的形式来表现了唯物主义的倾向。
    达·芬奇
    辽奥纳多·达芬奇是十五世纪意大利的伟大画家、作家、思想家及科学家。他生于一四五二年四月十五日，到今年是整整五百周年。
    达·芬奇是文艺复兴时代的巨人之一。他的天才是多方面的。他的天才首先有力地表现在艺术方面。他在幼年时，即喜欢绘画、雕刻和音乐。十八岁时，入威洛契阿的画室学画。一四七七年离开画室后，任米兰大公爵宫廷画师和美术院院长多年。在这期间，他创作了不少有名的艺术作品，如“弗兰瑟斯科·司弗尔扎的铜像”、“最后的晚餐”等。“最后的晚餐”是描写耶稣临死前一晚和他的门徒会餐的情景，历三年而脱稿，是一幅不朽的杰作。一四九九年十二月至一五○六年，达·芬奇率领他的学生离米兰往威尼斯、佛罗伦斯及意大利中部各城市游历。在这期间，他的名作有“蒙娜丽莎”等。
    达·芬奇是一个热情的探求者。他在科学方面，通晓解剖学、生理学、物理学、数学、地质学、天文学……他热心地以观察和实验的方法研究了在他那时代所有的每一门理论的和应用的科学，其中有些并且是他所首先开始研究的。在许多方面，他的研究成就远超过他的同时代人。他又是当时最伟大、最成功的建筑家、工程师。他的建筑和工程计划大胆、进步，具有惊人的气魄。
    维·雨果
    维克多·雨果是十九世纪法国的伟大的民主主义作家—诗人、小说家、剧作家。他于一八○二年二月二十六日生在法国东部比撤康，到今年正是一百五十周年。
    雨果从青年时代起就开始写诗和剧本。他用他早年的剧作“克伦威尔”和“欧尔那尼”宣布了和古典的传统断绝关系。“欧尔那尼”的上演成为新兴的浪漫主义文学流派取得胜利的一个示威。
    经过法国一八三○年革命后，雨果完全放弃了他在青年时期所曾沾染到的保皇主义思想。一八三一年，他写了名作“巴黎圣母院”，以很大的同情描写了十五世纪法国人民反对压迫的英勇斗争。一八三四年他发表了小说“穷人克罗总”，描写一个工人和他的家庭的悲惨生活。
    在法国一八四八年二月革命中，当资产阶级被革命的震动所吓倒而公开地走上反动的道路时，雨果宣布自己是共和主义者。他被选为革命后的制宪会议和立法会议的议员，他向议会中的反动派进行了尖锐的斗争，因而为反动派所仇视。
    一八五一年拿破仑第三称帝以后，雨果因反对帝制政体而被迫流亡国外，直到一八七○年拿破仑第三帝国颠覆后才回到自己的祖国。在十九年的流亡期间，他创作了最重要的小说：“悲惨世界”、“海上劳工”、“笑着的人”等。在这些作品里，雨果表现了他对被贱视者和被压迫者的热烈同情。
    一八七一年巴黎工人阶级建立了巴黎公社，雨果虽然没有参加这个运动，但在巴黎公社失败后，他坚决地保护公社社员，使他们免遭当时法国反动资产阶级的残害。
    雨果极端憎恨民族压迫，同情被压迫民族的斗争。他关怀美洲黑奴的命运；他歌颂希腊人反对土耳其统治的斗争；他劝告帝俄军队的士兵不要为“暴政服务”去反对波兰人民；他鼓舞墨西哥爱国者保卫他们的祖国，反抗拿破仑第三所派遣的法国远征军；他声援被英国法律所判处死刑的爱尔兰爱国人士；他鼓舞古巴人民起义反对西班牙的统治。在一八六○年英法联军攻陷北京，抢劫并烧毁圆明园。雨果也曾对这种强盗行为予以正义的揭发和抗议。在一八四九年八月，在巴黎举行过一次国际性的“和平之友”大会。雨果被选为主席，他在热情的演说中说：“全世界和平的思想是一切民族的财产，他们要求和平，如同要求最高的幸福一样。理性终将代替战争……我不仅宣布，全世界和平可以得到，我还要说，它是不可避免的。”
    雨果于一八八五年五月二十二日逝世，成千成万的人，奏着“马赛曲”来参加这位伟大的民主主义、人道主义的作家的葬礼，向他致敬。
    尼·华·果戈理
    尼古拉·华西里耶维赤·果戈理是十九世纪俄罗斯的大作家。他于一八○九年四月一日生于南俄波尔达瓦省；于一八五二年三月四日逝世，到今年是他逝世一百周年。
    果戈理的文学活动是在十九世纪三十和四十年代展开的。在这个时期，沙皇政府为十二月党人的起义所吓倒，残酷地压制自由思想的任何表现。但是俄国的先进文化界仍努力奋斗，在文学、音乐、戏剧、绘画、哲学等领域宣传民主思想。果戈理的创作就是在这种条件下发展和成熟的。
    果戈理在早年曾在彼得堡的沙皇机关中担任一个小职位。在这里他看见沙皇政府官吏从上到下都是在盗窃国家财产，把职务当成他们发财的来源。于是果戈理便放弃政府机关的职位，从事写作。他认识了普希金、茹柯夫斯基，并得到普希金的极大的鼓励和帮助。他写了许多描写乌克兰的短篇和中篇小说。一八三五年他的著名戏剧“巡按”问世。由于这部剧作抨击了沙皇专制政府的罪恶，揭露了当时俄国农奴社会的紊乱与黑暗，所以在演出后，作者受到统治阶级的迫害，于一八三六年流亡国外，一八三七年定居罗马。
    一八四二年果戈理发表了巨著“死魂灵”，这部小说生动地刻划出了当时俄国地主、官僚的荒唐的、腐朽的生活，成为革命战士打击贵族、官僚、地主政权的有力武器。
    果戈理在俄罗斯文学史上占据着极其重要的位置，他与普希金齐名。他是俄国文学中批判的现实主义的奠基人。他给俄国文学以新的内容，使它真实地反映生活。柏林斯基说他是“伟大的天才，英明的诗人及当代俄国的第一流作家”；车尔尼雪夫斯基说他是最伟大的俄罗斯作家。列宁和斯大林对果戈理也有高度的评价，常常引用他的讽刺形象来揭穿敌人的嘴脸。
    果戈理的作品已被译成世界上各种文字，成为普遍的读物。这说明果戈理的丰富遗产已成为全人类所共有的财富。
