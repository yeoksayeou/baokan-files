Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 16th: The spokesperson for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters recently issued a statement regarding the just demands made by our captured personnel on Koje Island to the U.S. military authorities, which include stopping all atrocities, ceasing "voluntary repatriation" and forcible screening, and recognizing the rights of prisoners of war. The statement is as follows:

    The recent heroic struggle of our captured personnel on Koje Island against atrocities, "voluntary repatriation," and forcible screening, and demanding recognition of prisoners' rights, has thoroughly exposed the lie fabricated by the U.S. side that 100,000 of our captured personnel "refuse repatriation." General Clark, commander of the invading U.S. forces in Korea, was forced to publish the demands of our captured personnel to the U.S. military authorities on May 12th, which ultimately and irrefutably declared the bankruptcy of the U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposition and exposed that the U.S. side's purpose in insisting on this unreasonable proposition is entirely to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations.

    The solemn demands put forward by our captured personnel, "Immediately cease barbaric acts, insults, torture, forced writing of blood letters, massacres, and the use of prisoners of war as experimental subjects for poisonous gas, bacteriological weapons, and atomic bombs," and "Guarantee the human rights and lives of prisoners of war in accordance with international law," depict a scene of hell on earth in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps on Koje Island, under the violent control of the U.S. side. This thoroughly exposes the shameless deception of Ridgway and Joy, who have claimed to uphold "humanitarian principles" and respect the "inherent rights of individuals" of our captured personnel.

    The reasons why our captured personnel resolutely oppose the so-called "voluntary repatriation" are very clear. In the dark and dismal U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, the power of life and death rests entirely with the U.S. military authorities and the Syngman Rhee special agents and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs they employ. There is no "voluntariness" whatsoever. The U.S. side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" is, in reality, forcible detention. Opposing forcible detention is the unwavering and resolute will of our captured personnel.

    Our captured personnel demand an immediate cessation of forcible screening and of rearming prisoners of war to send them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. It is only natural for every prisoner of war to hope to return home and resume a peaceful life. The unconditional repatriation of all prisoners of war held by each side after the armistice is an unavoidable obligation of both commanders. There has never been any so-called "screening" in any international regulations to determine whether or not to repatriate prisoners of war. Our captured personnel risked U.S. massacres and retaliation to put forward their opposition to forcible screening. This thoroughly proves that the so-called "screening" is without any basis and is entirely a synonym for U.S. violent acts. The so-called "screening results" are merely the result of violent acts, and they prove that the U.S. side's proposal to "jointly and publicly verify" these "screening results" after the armistice is an attempt to further legitimize the results of these violent acts.

    Our captured personnel's demand that the U.S. side recognize the delegation (committee) formed by the prisoners of war is a completely legitimate demand that complies with the Geneva Convention. Article 79 of the Geneva Convention stipulates that prisoners of war have the power to elect their own representatives to handle the administrative affairs of the prisoner-of-war camp and to negotiate with the military authorities. Article 80 of the Convention also stipulates that the prisoners' representatives have the right to organize their own mutual aid system. Given the dark and dismal persecution and abuse in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, this legitimate demand of our captured personnel is clearly a necessary measure to protect their rights.

    The above four demands made by our captured personnel to the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander are completely justified. All officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are determined to fully support these just demands.

    In the same statement, Clark openly stated that the U.S. side would not fulfill its promises to our captured personnel. The U.S. Department of Defense also issued a statement attempting to overturn the U.S. promises and whitewash U.S. crimes. This shows that on the one hand, the U.S. side is attempting to go back on its word and break its promises to our captured personnel, continuing to adhere to its inhumane and Geneva Convention-violating bloody policies towards our captured personnel. On the other hand, it is attempting to use these statements to support its so-called "voluntary repatriation" and forcible screening, which are aimed at delaying and sabotaging the armistice negotiations. However, the U.S. military authorities once made a clear guarantee to our captured personnel that they would "no longer forcibly screen and arm prisoners of war" and guaranteed that they would "eliminate future violence and bloodshed." This confession and promise of the U.S. aggressors can never be denied or overturned. Regardless of how shamelessly the U.S. side denies their guarantees, and regardless of how the U.S. representatives insist at the armistice conference on their unreasonable plan based on the completely bankrupt "voluntary repatriation" and "screening results," the delegation of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will always oppose the U.S. side's bloody policies towards our captured personnel that violate the Geneva Convention, and resolutely and unshakeably oppose the U.S. side's unilateral and unreasonable plan to forcibly detain our captured personnel. All officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will fight to the end for the sacred right of their captured personnel to return home and live a peaceful life after the armistice.

    朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军总部发言人发表谈话
    我军全力支持我被俘人员的正义要求
    坚决反对美方违反人道的“自愿遣返”和强迫甄别的血腥政策
    【新华社开城十六日电】朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军总部发言人顷就巨济岛上我方被俘人员对美军当局提出的停止一切暴行、停止“自愿遣返”和强迫甄别、及承认战俘权利的正义要求，发表谈话如下：
    最近巨济岛上我方被俘人员进行的反对暴行、反对“自愿遣返”和强迫甄别，要求承认战俘权利的英勇斗争，彻底揭穿了美方所捏造的我方十万被俘人员“拒绝遣返”的谎言。侵朝美军统帅克拉克五月十二日被迫发表的我方被俘人员对美军当局提出的要求，最后地无可置辩地宣布了美方所谓“自愿遣返”主张的破产，暴露了美方坚持这一无理主张的目的，完全是拖延及破坏朝鲜停战谈判。
    我方被俘人员所提出的“立刻停止野蛮行为、侮辱、酷刑、强迫写血书、大批屠杀、用战俘作毒气细菌武器及原子弹的试验品”，和“根据国际法保证战俘的人权与生命”的严正要求，描绘出巨济岛美方战俘营中一幅在美方暴力控制下的人间地狱的景象，彻底揭穿了李奇微及乔埃等所宣称的对我方被俘人员的“人道原则”，及尊重我方被俘人员“个人天赋权利”等无耻欺骗。
    我方被俘人员坚决反对所谓“自愿遣返”的理由是很显然的。在暗无天日的美方俘虏营中，生杀予夺全凭美军当局及他们雇用的李承晚特务和蒋介石匪帮，在那里根本没有什么“自愿”可言。美方的所谓“自愿遣返”，实际上就是强迫扣留。反对强迫扣留是我方被俘人员不可动摇的坚决意志。
    我方被俘人员要求立刻停止强迫甄别、停止重新武装战俘送给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。每个战俘希望重返家园，恢复和平生活本是天经地义的。停战后无条件遣返其所收容的全部战俘，是双方司令官不可逃避的义务。在一切国际法规中也从未有过决定战俘遣返与否的所谓“甄别”。我方被俘人员甘冒美方屠杀与报复的危险，提出反对强迫甄别。这彻底地证明了所谓“甄别”是没有任何根据的，它完全是美方暴力行为的代名词。所谓“甄别结果”只是暴力行为的结果，它证明了美方所提出的“停战后共同公开证实”这种“甄别结果”是企图进一步将此种暴力行为的结果加以合法化。
    我方被俘人员要求美方承认战俘所组成的代表团（委员会），是完全合乎日内瓦公约的正当要求。日内瓦公约第七十九条规定战俘有权选举自己的代表来处理俘虏营的行政事务和与军事当局办理交涉。该约第八十条并规定俘虏的代表们有权组织战俘自己的互助制度。在美方俘虏营中暗无天日的迫害和虐杀的情况之下，我方被俘人员的这一正当要求显然是为了保护他们应享受的权利的必要措施。
    我方被俘人员向美方俘虏营营长提出的上述四大要求是完全正当的。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体将士决以全力支持这些正义要求。
    在克拉克的同一声明里，他竟公然表示美方将不履行对我方被俘人员的诺言。美国国防部也发出了企图推翻美方诺言及洗刷美方罪行的声明。这说明美方一方面企图出尔反尔，自食其对我方被俘人员的诺言，继续坚持其对我方被俘人员的违反人道、违反日内瓦公约的血腥政策，另一方面又企图利用这些声明来支持其旨在拖延并破坏停战谈判的所谓“自愿遣返”和强迫甄别。但是，美军当局曾经对我方被俘人员明白保证“不再强迫甄别及武装战俘”，并保证将“消除以后的暴力及流血”，美国侵略者的这一纸供状与诺言是永远无法抵赖和推翻的。不管美方如何无耻地否认他们的保证，不管美方代表在停战会议上如何坚持其以已经彻底破产的“自愿遣返”及“甄别结果”为基础的无理方案，朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军代表团将始终反对美方对我方被俘人员的违反日内瓦公约的血腥政策，并坚决不可动摇地反对美方强迫扣留我方被俘人员的片面无理方案。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军全体将士将为他们的被俘人员在停战后回家过和平生活的神圣权利而斗争到底。
