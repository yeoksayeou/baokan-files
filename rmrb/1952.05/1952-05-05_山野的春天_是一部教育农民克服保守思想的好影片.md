	“Springtime in the Mountains and Fields” is a Good Film for Educating Farmers to Overcome Conservative Thinking
	Editor: The Soviet film “Springtime in the Mountains and Fields” depicts how a backward collective farm in the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, transformed into a prosperous collective farm. People connect everything they have with the motherland and the great Stalin. The Communist Party encouraged and organized the masses to overcome the difficulties of poor soil and supported new discoveries (using apatite from the cliffs to fertilize the fields), thus making it possible for local farmers to create new records—increasing grain production from 1,600 kilograms per hectare to 8,000 kilograms.
	Currently, our agricultural production slogan is: "Increase yield per unit area" and strive for a bumper harvest. We need the vast number of farmers and cadres who lead production to have full confidence in overcoming all difficulties and creating new records, harvesting more grain for the motherland, and providing a strong material foundation for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We must thoroughly criticize conservative ideas such as "production has reached its peak" and "the soil is not good, no matter how hard we try, we won’t get much out of it.” In the film "Springtime in the Mountains and Fields," the transformation of Sagen Village and the indomitable fighting spirit of Keisu gave us great inspiration, making us further realize that our countryside, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will have broad prospects for development just like the Soviet countryside.
	I suggest that this film about increasing agricultural production be shown in rural areas to enlighten and educate farmers and increase agricultural production.

    “山野的春天”是一部教育农民克服保守思想的好影片
    编辑同志：苏联影片“山野的春天”描写了苏联一个落后的集体农庄怎样在共产党的领导下，变成了一个富饶的集体农庄的过程。人们把自己的一切都和祖国，和伟大的斯大林联系在一起。共产党鼓舞和组织群众克服土质瘦薄的困难，并支持新的发见（用山崖的磷灰土肥田），因此使当地农民有可能创造新纪录——从每公顷产粮一千六百公斤提高到八千公斤。
    目前我们农业生产的口号是：“提高单位面积产量”，争取丰收。我们需要广大的农民和领导生产的干部有充分信心克服一切困难，创造新纪录，为祖国收获更多粮食，供给抗美援朝以雄厚的物质力量。我们要彻底批判那些“增产到顶了”“土不好，拚命干不出多大出息来”等保守思想。在“山野的春天”影片里，萨根村的改造，凯苏的顽强斗争精神，给了我们很大启发，使我们进一步认识了我们的农村在共产党领导下，将和苏联的农村一样，有着广阔发展的前途。
    我建议把这部关于提高农业生产的影片，拿到农村去放映，以启发教育农民，提高农业生产量。
