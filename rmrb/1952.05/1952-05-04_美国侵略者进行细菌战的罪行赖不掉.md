    The crimes of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China, after being confirmed and exposed by foreign journalists in Korea and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, have aroused righteous condemnation from peace-loving people all over the world. However, Acheson, Ridgway, and others are still trying to deny it. Eden, the British Foreign Secretary and accomplice of American imperialism, also shamelessly wants to cover up the crimes committed by American imperialism. Now, as a scientific worker and witness (if Acheson and his ilk want to ask about my identity, I can tell them that I am a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a Doctor of Entomology from the United States, a member of the American Society of Sigma Xi, a researcher at Cambridge University in England, and a member of the International Congress of Entomology), I would like to explain to scientists all over the world, especially entomologists, about the crime of American imperialism in spreading insects carrying germs and viruses in Northeast China, based on what I have seen and heard during my twenty days of field investigation.
    The work of American imperialists in researching biological products—germs and viruses—in preparation for launching germ warfare in recent years has long become a well-known fact. When I personally visited the research work on bacterial insecticides in California, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and other states in the United States, as well as in Canada and New England, I saw many experiments on cultivating germs and viruses, using insects to carry germs and viruses, and photos of germ warfare. At the same time, in conversations with experts in this type of research work—Smith (American microbiology expert), Metcalf (American sanitary entomology expert), Brough (American bacteriology expert), Magoffin (Canadian sanitary entomology expert), Smith (British pathology expert), etc.—I learned about quite specific situations: I knew that American imperialism had completed preparations for partially conducting germ warfare as early as the spring of 1950, and they also revealed the targets they were preparing to use were in Asia, especially in China, which they considered to have "poor environmental hygiene" and a large population.
    My investigation of the crimes of American imperialism's germ warfare in Northeast China was always conducted with the attitude of a scientific worker. I brought instruments to measure the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and soil. I not only looked at the poisonous insect specimens sent by the masses, but also paid attention to observing the areas where the poisonous insects were found. In each area, I personally collected specimens. I worked along the Yalu River for two days and saw the bodies of large numbers of chironomids densely packed together. I have also been to many areas where poisonous insects are widely distributed, interviewed witnesses, and listened to accusations from hundreds of people. These included elderly men and women in their seventies, young primary school students, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, workers, farmers, small merchants, doctors, and bacteriologists. They are all witnesses to the crimes of American imperialism. I personally heard or saw American planes invading our airspace in Andong and Kuandian, and saw the remains of bacteriological bombs dropped by American imperialism and many feathers used to carry viruses and germs in Kuandian. According to the records of the Northeast Air Defense Agency and the reports of the areas where poisonous insects were found, it was completely confirmed that these things were dropped by American planes. Secondly, there are many kinds of poisonous insects spread by American imperialism in Northeast China that have been identified by scientists. According to the insect type, living habits, ecology, and natural environment in which these poisonous insects occur, their appearance is contrary to nature. I can cite a few examples: such as houseflies, green bottle flies, Culex mosquitoes (male and female adults), locusts (adults), etc. According to the climate in Northeast China, the earliest period for their appearance should be after early May, but the date of discovery this time was March 15. The appearance of these insects was not near sewage or garbage piles, not in the warm rooms where humans live, not in the grass and farmland sheltered from wind and rain, but simultaneously and in large numbers on the cement ball fields and platform snow surfaces in Shenyang City. The minimum activity temperature for these pests should be above 15 degrees Celsius, but the air temperature at the time of discovery was between minus 10 and 5 degrees Celsius. We checked the temperature records of the area where the poisonous insects were found from January to March 15 of this year, and it never exceeded 10 degrees Celsius. These various situations completely confirm that American imperialism is spreading various kinds of poisonous insects carrying disease-transmitting germs in vast areas of Northeast China, attempting to massively kill peaceful Chinese residents and destroy their crops in a planned manner.
    Judging from the types of poisonous insects spread by American imperialism, they want to use the factor of gradually warming weather to make people think that infectious diseases occur naturally. Most of the planes used by them to spread poisonous insects are active on cloudy days or at night, which is also an attempt to conceal their evidence. But this evasive tactic will not succeed. Because not only the workers of the investigation team, but also tens of millions of peaceful Chinese residents, can testify.
    Finally, I would like to mention that due to the high vigilance of the Chinese people and the government, and the active efforts of air defense and epidemic prevention workers, the germ warfare carried out by the American aggressors in Northeast China has not achieved their expected results; on the contrary, the Chinese people have full confidence and full preparation to defeat the bacteriological offensive of the American germ warfare criminals.

    美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行赖不掉
    中国科学院研究员、昆虫学家  马世骏
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜和我国东北使用细菌武器的罪行，经过在朝鲜的各国记者和国际民主法律工作者协会调查团证实并揭发后，激起了全世界爱好和平人们的正义的声讨。但艾奇逊、李奇微等还在狡赖。美帝国主义的帮凶——英国外相艾登也厚颜无耻地想掩饰美帝国主义所干的罪行。我现在愿以科学工作者和见证人的身份（设若艾奇逊之流要问我的身份，我可以告诉他们，我是中国科学院研究员，也是美国的昆虫学博士，美国自然科学研究荣誉学会会员，英国剑桥大学研究员和国际昆虫学会会员），就我二十天的实地调查中的所见所闻，向全世界的科学家，特别是昆虫工作者说明美帝国主义在我国东北撒布带有病菌、病毒的昆虫的罪行。
    美帝国主义者近几年来研究生物制品——病菌、病毒，准备发动细菌战的工作，早已成为尽人皆知的事实。我个人在美国加里福尼亚、尼瓦达、犹达、华盛顿等州和加拿大、纽英格兰等地参观细菌杀虫的研究工作时，曾看到了许多培养病菌、病毒、利用昆虫携带病菌、病毒的实验和细菌杀人的照片。同时在和这类研究工作的专家们——斯密司（Smith，美国微生物学专家）、密特卡弗（Metcalf，美国卫生害虫学专家）、勃劳（Brough，美国细菌学专家）、麦高芬（Magoffin，加拿大卫生害虫学专家）、斯密司（Smith，英国病理学专家）等的谈话中，已知道了相当具体的情况：知道美帝国主义早在一九五零年春就完成了部分地进行细菌战的准备工作，而且他们也曾透露出准备使用的对象，是在亚洲，特别是他们认为“环境卫生工作较差”和人口众多的中国。
    我去东北调查美帝国主义细菌战罪行，始终是以科学工作者的态度去进行工作的。我带有测量大气、土壤的温度、湿度的仪器。我不但要看群众送来的毒虫标本，更注意到发现毒虫的地区观察。在每个地区，我都亲自作了采集工作。我在鸭绿江沿岸工作了两天，看到了那些密集着的大批摇蚊的尸体。我也曾到过许多毒虫分布很广的地区，访问过证人，并听取了几百人的控诉。其中包括七十几岁的老大爷和老妈妈、年轻的小学生、人民解放军指战员、工人、农民、小商人、医生和细菌学家。他们都是美帝国主义罪行的见证人。我曾亲自在安东、宽甸听到或看到侵入我领空的美国飞机，在宽甸见到了美帝国主义投掷下来的细菌弹残骸和许多用来携带病毒和病菌的羽毛。根据东北防空机关的记录和发现毒虫地区的报告，完全相符地证实了这些东西是美国飞机投下来的。其次，美帝国主义在东北撒布的毒虫，经过科学家鉴定的已有许多种。按照这些毒虫的虫型、生活习性、生态和发生的自然环境来说，它们的出现都是违背自然的。我可以就中举几个例子：如家蝇、绿蝇、库雷蚊（雌雄成虫）、蝗虫（成虫）等，按照我国东北的气候，出现的时期最早应在五月初以后，但是这次发现的日期则是三月十五日。这些昆虫的出现，不是在污水、垃圾堆附近，不是在人类居住的暖室中，不是在遮蔽风雨的草丛和农田里，而是同时地大批地出现在沈阳市的洋灰球场和平台雪面上。这几种害虫的活动温度，最低亦应在摄氏十五度以上，但发现时的气温则在摄氏零下十度到五度间。我们检查了发现毒虫的地区自本年一月到三月十五日的气温记载，从来没有超过摄氏十度以上。这种种的情况，完全证实了美帝国主义在我国东北广大地区撒布各类带有传播病菌的毒虫，企图大规模地杀害中国和平居民，并毁灭他们的农作物，是有计划地进行的。
    从美帝国主义撒布毒虫的种类来看，他们是想利用天气渐暖的因素，使人们以为传染病是天然发生的。他们撒布毒虫的飞机，大多数是在阴天或夜间活动，也就是企图借此掩饰他们的罪证。但他们这种规避手段不会成功。因为不但是调查团的工作者，而且有成千成万的中国和平居民，都可作见证。
    最后我愿提到：由于中国人民及政府的高度警惕和防空防疫工作人员的积极努力，美国侵略者在我东北所进行的细菌战，并没有获得他们的预期效果；相反地，中国人民有充分信心，充分的准备，可以击败美国细菌战犯的细菌攻势。
