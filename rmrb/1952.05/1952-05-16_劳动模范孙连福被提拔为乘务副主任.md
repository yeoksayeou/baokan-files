    Labor Model Sun Lianfu Promoted to Deputy Director of Train Operations

    Editor: Sun Lianfu, a national railway labor model, was originally a dispatcher in the Qingdao Railway Branch's train section, and has now been promoted to Deputy Director of Train Operations. He often encourages the production enthusiasm of train crews and conducts ideological education work for them. Li Xiumei, a broadcaster in our section, was once tired of train service work and requested a job transfer several times. Sun Lianfu had several individual talks with Li Xiumei, enlightened her, and educated her, pointing out that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, any job is serving the people and is glorious. After continuous persuasion, Li Xiumei finally changed her attitude and settled down to work. During the "Three-Anti" movement, Sun Lianfu actively launched a relentless struggle against corrupt elements. Although he is very busy, he does not forget production and often inspects sanitation and other work while on the train. Sun Lianfu has truly played a leading role among the masses.

    劳动模范孙连福被提拔为乘务副主任
    编辑同志：全国铁路劳动模范孙连福，原是青岛铁路分局列车段的派班员，现在已被提升为乘务副主任了。他经常鼓励乘务人员的生产情绪，对他们进行思想教育工作。我段广播员李秀美曾厌倦过乘务工作，几次要求调换工作。孙连福和李秀美作了多次个别谈话，开导他，教育他，指出在毛主席领导下，任何岗位工作都是为人民服务，都是光荣的。经过不断的说服，李秀美终于转变态度，安心工作了。在“三反”运动中，孙连福积极和贪污分子展开无情的斗争。他虽然很忙，但还不忘生产，常随车检查卫生等工作。孙连福在群众中真正起了带头作用。　阎恒德　张宪才
