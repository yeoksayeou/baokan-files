    [Our Newspaper] On May 17th, Czechoslovak Military Attaché to China, Colonel Procházka, presented gifts to the Chinese People's Liberation Army on behalf of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Defense, demonstrating the friendly unity between the people and armies of China and Czechoslovakia. The presentation ceremony was held at 6:00 PM that day. Those attending the ceremony included Xiao Xiangrong, Director of the General Office of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Li Zhaobing, Deputy Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department, and more than ten representatives from various departments of the Military Commission. At the beginning of the ceremony, Czechoslovak Military Attaché to China, Colonel Procházka, first extended his heartfelt and warm greetings to the Chinese People's Liberation Army on behalf of the Czechoslovak Minister of National Defense and the army, and said in his speech:
    “Our people love the Chinese People's Liberation Army, love its close unity with the Chinese people, love its indomitable and fearless fighting spirit in the cause of liberating its own people and opposing imperialist aggressors, love its profound Marxist-Leninist education, and love it first and foremost because its creator and leader is the great revolutionary strategist Mao Zedong!
    Please accept these ordinary gifts from the workers and soldiers of our country, these gifts are only a slight expression of our sincere love for you.
    The Czech people and army rejoice in the great achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in building its army. We deeply know that the application of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist principles and the military doctrines of the Soviet army is the guarantee of these existing achievements and future achievements.”
    Xiao Xiangrong, Director of the General Office of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, and Li Zhaobing, Deputy Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, accepted the gifts on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and expressed their warm thanks. Director Xiao Xiangrong said in his reply:
    “The friendly relations between the armies of China and Czechoslovakia have further developed. The arrival of the Chinese People's Liberation Army delegation headed by Regiment Commander Liu Daosheng in Czechoslovakia in September 1951 and the presentation of gifts this time will help the Chinese People's Liberation Army to further understand the people's army of your country, thereby further enhancing the unity and friendship between the people's armies of China and Czechoslovakia.
    Military Attaché Comrade, when the US imperialist bloc is openly preparing for a new world war, strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Czechoslovak People's Army is of great significance in the cause of fighting for peace.
    We firmly believe that the unity of the armed forces of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is becoming more consolidated, and will surely shatter the war conspiracies of imperialism."
    The gifts included movie projectors, radios, accordions, hunting rifles, glassware and other items, all of which are the latest products of Czechoslovakia. After browsing the gifts, a banquet was held, during which frequent toasts were made for the friendship and unity between the people's armies of China and Czechoslovakia, and for the health of their great leaders. After the meeting, the film "The Great Army Marching to Liberate Tibet" was shown.

    捷克斯洛伐克驻我国上校武官普罗查
    代表捷国防部向我人民解放军赠礼
    【本报讯】五月十七日，捷克斯洛伐克驻中国上校武官普罗查，代表捷克斯洛伐克国防部向中国人民解放军赠献礼品，表现了中捷两国人民和人民军队间的友谊团结。在当日下午六时举行献礼仪式。参加受礼仪式的有中国人民革命军事委员会办公厅主任萧向荣，总政治部文化部副部长李兆炳及军委各部代表十余人。受礼仪式开始，捷克斯洛伐克驻中国上校武官普罗查首先代表捷克斯洛伐克国防部长和军队向中国人民解放军致衷心的热烈的敬礼，并致词说：
    “我们的人民热爱中国人民解放军，爱它与中国人民的紧密团结一致，爱它在解放自己人民和反对帝国主义侵略者事业中的不屈不挠大无畏的战斗精神，爱它具有深刻的马克思列宁主义的教养，爱它首先因为它的创造者和领袖是伟大的革命战略家毛泽东！
    请你们接受我们祖国劳动者和军队的这些平凡的礼物，这些礼物仅只略表对你们的衷心友爱。
    捷克人民和军队为中国人民解放军建军的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。我们深知毛泽东的马克思列宁主义原则和苏联军队军事学说的运用，就是现有的这些成就和未来的成就的保障。”
    中国人民革命军事委员会办公厅主任萧向荣，和人民革命军事委员会总政治部文化部副部长李兆炳代表中国人民解放军接受礼品，并致以热忱的谢意。萧向荣主任在致答词中说：
    “中捷两国军队的友好关系已有着进一步的发展，一九五一年九月以刘道生团长为首的中国人民解放军代表团到达捷克斯洛伐克和此次礼物的赠送，更有助于中国人民解放军对贵国人民军队进一步的了解，从而更增进了中捷两国人民军队的团结与友谊。
    武官同志，当美帝国主义集团公开准备新的世界战争的时候，加强中国人民解放军与捷克斯洛伐克人民军队的友谊合作，在争取和平事业上是具有重要意义的。
    我们深信，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营武装力量的团结日趋巩固，必将粉碎帝国主义的战争阴谋。”
    礼品有：电影放映机、收音机、手风琴、猎枪、玻璃器具等多种，都是捷克斯洛伐克的最新出品。浏览礼品后，举行宴会，席间频频为中捷两国人民军队的友谊团结及其伟大领袖的身体健康而干杯。会后放映电影“解放西藏大军行”。
