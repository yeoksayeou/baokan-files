Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 30th: According to U.S. news agencies, the American aggressors, who have carried out countless bloody massacres of our captured personnel, on the 29th, again shot and wounded one of our captured personnel each on Koje Island for no reason, and carried out new armed provocations against our captured personnel with bayonets and tear gas.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 29th, one U.S. soldier in a guard tower "fired an automatic weapon at Compound 66," killing one of our captured personnel and wounding another. The American aggressors have always styled themselves as "observers" of the Geneva Convention, but the facts prove that they dare to arbitrarily use weapons to shoot prisoners of war for no reason and kill our unarmed captured personnel. This incident is by no means accidental, but part of a U.S. plot to attack our captured personnel in a planned way.

According to U.S. news agencies, just hours before this incident, the American aggressors had already carried out a serious armed provocation against our captured personnel in Compound 66. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 29th, "American soldiers and British soldiers wielding bayonets and throwing tear gas" suddenly rushed into Compound 66. "At this time, other soldiers of the U.S. 38th Regiment set up a protective circle inside the barbed wire of this compound." The dispatch said that U.S. and British soldiers demolished two houses in the compound, but "the sudden entry of soldiers into the compound was a closely guarded secret. The American officers present at the time were unwilling to reveal the reason for entering the compound to reporters." According to a United Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 29th, "United Nations soldiers" entered the prisoner-of-war camp on the 29th and used "shooting" and "throwing tear gas" to "divide" our captured personnel "into smaller groups." At this time, "around the compound, every twenty-five steps, a soldier stood guard, holding a rifle with a fixed bayonet. On each sentry post, soldiers guarded 0.30 caliber machine guns." In order to prevent the development of the situation from being revealed, the U.S. side ordered United Press reporters to leave the area shortly after the atrocity began. U.S. press officer Hall refused to issue a statement on the development of the situation and forbade the British military press officer present from expressing his opinion. Therefore, the outcome of this new atrocity by the U.S. side has not yet been revealed.

This series of bloody atrocities and armed provocations by the American aggressors is a signal that the U.S. side is about to carry out a new large-scale massacre of our captured personnel. An Associated Press dispatch from Koje Island on the 29th, like a bloodthirsty beast, screamed: "High-spirited troops from various countries are sharpening their knives and guns, waiting for the date of the 'Koje Island crackdown' to approach."

### 美方制造新的血腥暴行并进行武装挑衅  是美方即将在巨济岛进行大屠杀的信号

    美方制造新的血腥暴行并进行武装挑衅
    是美方即将在巨济岛进行大屠杀的信号
    【新华社开城三十日电】据美国通讯社透露：对我方被俘人员进行了无数次血腥屠杀的美国侵略者，二十九日又在巨济岛上无故枪杀和枪伤我方被俘人员各一名，并且用刺刀和催泪弹对我方被俘人员进行了新的武装挑衅。
    据美联社巨济岛二十九日电称，在岗楼上的美军士兵一人“用自动武器向第六十六号营场射击”，打死我方被俘人员一人，另有一人负伤。美国侵略者一向以日内瓦公约的“遵守者”自居，但事实却证明他们竟然敢于无缘无故地任意用武器射击战俘，将手无寸铁的我方被俘人员加以杀害。这一事件决不是偶然的，而是美方有计划地进攻我方被俘人员的阴谋的一部分。
    据美国通讯社透露，就在这一事件发生以前数小时，美国侵略者已经对第六十六号营场中的我方被俘人员进行了一次严重的武装挑衅。据美联社巨济岛二十九日电称：“挥舞着刺刀、投掷催泪弹的美国士兵和英国士兵”，突然冲进了第六十六号营场。“这时美国第三十八团的其他兵士则在这个营场的铁丝网里面布置了一个保护圈”。据该消息说，美英士兵拆掉了营场中的两处房屋，但是“兵士们突然进入营场是一个保守得很严密的秘密。这事发生时在场的美国军官们都不愿向记者透露进入营场的理由”。另据合众社巨济岛二十九日电透露：“联合国军士兵”在二十九日开入了战俘营，并用“开枪”和“投掷催泪弹”的办法将我方被俘人员“分为人数较少的集团”。在这时候，“在营场周围，每隔二十五步兵站有步兵一人，手持上了刺刀的步枪。在各个岗哨上，士兵把守着零点三○口径的机枪”。为了不使事态的发展透露出来，美方在这一暴行开始以后不久，就命令合众社的记者离开该地区。美方新闻官员霍尔并拒绝就事态发展发表声明，而且禁止在场的英军新闻官员发表意见。因此，美方这一新的暴行的结果如何，还没有被透露出来。
    美国侵略者这一连串血腥暴行和武装挑衅，是美方即将对我方被俘人员进行新的大规模屠杀的信号。美联社巨济岛二十九日电像嗜血的野兽一样地嘶叫说：“斗志昂扬的各国军队磨刀擦枪地等待着，‘巨济岛大弹压’的日期已经临近了。”
