    Recommending the Method of Teaching Singing to the Masses at the Gorky Culture and Rest Park in Moscow
    To the Editor: Zhang Shouming's letter in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on April 29th pointed out that the Beijing New Song Chorus and literary and art circles in Shenyang are teaching the masses to sing in public places, which enables new songs to spread rapidly among the broad masses. This method is very good. In order to better carry out mass music activities, I would like to recommend the method of teaching singing to the masses at the Gorky Culture and Rest Park in Moscow as a reference for music workers to promote mass music activities.
    In order to cultivate the ability of the masses to appreciate music, the Gorky Culture and Rest Park regularly holds music lectures, with a dedicated person responsible for explaining and analyzing outstanding works by Russian classical composers and Soviet modern composers to music listeners of varying levels. Sometimes, music question-and-answer evenings are held, inviting the composers most familiar to the masses to attend and answer questions. When a famous composer appears before the masses, the masses always cheer for him as if they were seeing an old friend. Composers sometimes personally teach the masses to sing, or play songs themselves, which gives the masses great interest and encouragement in learning music. What is even more worthy of our learning is that large screens are installed in many important places in the park, on which are written the songs most loved by the masses, and people are taught to sing at any time. Sometimes, famous band or choir conductors are invited to give guidance, which is of great help in improving mass music activities.
    I suggest that the Beijing New Song Chorus and other relevant departments install large screens or use large blackboards to copy excellent new songs in public places where working people gather and visit, and have dedicated personnel to teach them. This method can also be gradually extended to rural temple fairs and markets.

    推荐莫斯科高尔基文化休息  公园教授群众唱歌的方法
    编辑同志：四月二十九日人民日报“读者来信”栏所载张守铭的来信指出：北京新歌合唱团和沈阳文艺界在群众场合教授群众唱歌，使新歌曲能在广大群众中迅速传播，这种办法是很好的。为了使群众性的音乐活动更好地开展起来，我愿意推荐莫斯科高尔基文化休息公园教授群众唱歌的办法，作为音乐工作者推动群众音乐活动的参考。
    高尔基文化休息公园，为了培养群众欣赏音乐的能力，经常举办音乐演讲会，由专人负责，向各种不同程度的音乐听众们讲解、分析俄罗斯古典作曲家以及苏联现代作曲家的优秀作品。有时还举行音乐问答晚会，邀请群众最熟知的作曲家出席答问。当一个著名的作曲家出现在群众面前时，群众总是像见了老朋友一样地对他欢呼。作曲家有时亲自教授群众唱歌，或自己弹奏歌曲，这给群众学习音乐以很大的兴趣和鼓舞。更值得我们学习的，是他们在公园的许多重要地方都装置了大的幕布，上边写着群众所最爱好的歌曲，随时有人教唱。有时还请著名的乐队或合唱团的指挥者来指导，这对于群众音乐活动的提高，有很大的帮助。
    我建议北京新歌合唱团和其他有关部门，在劳动人民集聚、游览的公共场所，装置大幕布或用大黑板抄上优秀的新歌曲，由专人担任教授。这种办法还可以慢慢推广到农村的庙会和集市上去。
