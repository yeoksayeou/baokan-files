Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, May 30th: At today's meeting of the Korean Armistice Negotiation Delegation, our chief representative, General Nam Il, issued a serious warning to the other side regarding the incident on May 29th in which the US side once again killed and wounded our captured personnel on Geoje Island. General Nam Il pointed out: "On May 29th, your side killed one of our captured personnel and injured one of our captured personnel. I protest this to your side and once again demand that your side immediately cease this atrocity. I clearly remind you that protecting the safety of prisoners of war is a reciprocal obligation shared by both sides of the conflict. Your side should understand the consequences that your actions will cause."

General Nam Il further pointed out: The other side's actions of persecuting and massacring our captured personnel, as well as their claim to detain our captured personnel, completely violate all international law and the Geneva Convention. For the sake of the armistice in Korea, the other side must immediately cease its criminal acts against our captured personnel and withdraw its illegal claim to detain prisoners of war. General Nam Il's speech is as follows:

For the purpose of detaining our captured personnel, your side has committed various atrocities against them, completely violating the Geneva Convention and all international law. Your prisoner-of-war camp commander publicly confessed to the world your brutal acts in violation of the Geneva Convention, and guaranteed to our captured personnel that "violent actions and bloodshed will no longer occur," and guaranteed that they "can hope to receive humane treatment in accordance with the principles of international law." However, in order to persist in your goal of detaining prisoners of war, you have openly torn up your guarantees, continued to implement inhumane treatment, cut off the food supply to our captured personnel, and massacred our captured personnel on a large scale. Your side has not only failed to account for the repeated massacres but is also attempting to carry out collective massacres madly under the cover of a news blockade. This blatant act of sabotaging the Geneva Convention completely exposes the essence of your side's April 28th plan to detain prisoners of war. The claim to detain prisoners of war after the armistice is diametrically opposed to the spirit and substance of the Geneva Convention. Unconditionally releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the cessation of hostilities, so that they can return home to live peaceful lives, is an unavoidable obligation of both commanders. However, your side is attempting to detain our captured personnel after the armistice and hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and the Syngman Rhee clique as capital for your expansion of the war. The right of prisoners of war to return home after the armistice cannot be deprived under any name, but your side is attempting to rape the will of the prisoners of war and fabricate the lie that prisoners of war are unwilling to return home to live peaceful lives. This claim to detain prisoners of war cannot be found in any international regulations. On the issue of prisoners of war, the basic spirit and substance of all international law and the Geneva Convention is to guarantee humane treatment for prisoners of war and to guarantee the right of prisoners of war to be repatriated home after the armistice. Your side's actions of mistreating and persecuting our captured personnel and your claim to detain our captured personnel are completely criminal and completely illegal. For the sake of the armistice in Korea, your side must immediately cease its criminal acts against our captured personnel and withdraw your illegal claim to detain prisoners of war.

    美方竟又在巨济岛屠杀我被俘人员
    南日将军向美方提出严重警告
    要美方停止这种罪行撤回扣留战俘的非法主张
    【新华社开城三十日电】三十日朝鲜停战谈判代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军就五月二十九日美方在巨济岛上又一次杀伤我方被俘人员事，向对方提出严重的警告。南日将军指出：“你方在五月二十九日又杀死我方被俘人员一名，打伤我方被俘人员一名，对此我向你方提出抗议，再一次要求你方立即停止这种暴行。我明白地提醒你，保护战俘的安全是交战双方所同有的对等义务，你方不应该不明白你们这种行为所将引起的后果。”
    南日将军又指出：对方迫害与屠杀我方被俘人员的行为及扣留我方被俘人员的主张，彻底违反了一切国际公法与日内瓦公约。为了朝鲜的停战，对方必须立即停止对我方被俘人员的犯罪行为，撤回其扣留战俘的非法主张。南日将军的发言如下：
    你方为了扣留我方被俘人员的目的，对他们进行各种暴行，彻底违反了日内瓦公约和一切国际公法。你方战俘营长官向全世界公开招供了你方违反日内瓦公约的残暴行为，向我方被俘人员保证“暴力行动和流血事件不再发生”，保证他们“可以希望得到符合国际法原则的人道待遇”。但你方为了坚持扣留战俘的目的，公开撕毁了你方的保证，继续施行非人道的待遇，断绝我方被俘人员的伙食，大批地屠杀我方被俘人员。你方不仅对于迭次的屠杀血案未作交代，却更企图在新闻封锁的掩罩下，疯狂进行集体屠杀。这种悍然破坏日内瓦公约的非法行为，彻底暴露了你方四月二十八日扣留战俘的方案的实质。停战后扣留战俘的主张是和日内瓦公约的精神和实质水火不相容的。敌对行为终止后无条件释放并遣返全体战俘，使他们能回家过和平生活，是双方司令官不可逃避的义务。但你方却企图在停战后扣留我方被俘人员，送交蒋介石匪帮和李承晚集团作为你方扩大战争的资本。停战后战俘遣返回家的权利不容许以任何名义予以剥夺，但你方却企图强奸战俘的意志，制造战俘不愿回家过和平生活的鬼话。这种扣留战俘的主张在一切国际法规中找不出任何的根据。在战俘问题上，一切国际公法和日内瓦公约的基本精神和实质都是保证对战俘的人道待遇，保证战俘在停战后遣返回家的权利。你方虐待和迫害我方被俘人员的行为及扣留我方被俘人员的主张是彻底罪恶的，完全非法的。为了朝鲜的停战，你方必须立即停止对我方被俘人员的犯罪行为，撤回你方扣留战俘的非法主张。
