	▲ After completing the spring wheat planting ahead of schedule, various regions in Northeast China are vigorously carrying out large-field sowing. This spring, the rainfall in Northeast China has been abundant. Encouraged by the patriotic production increase campaign, farmers have shown great enthusiasm for production. The sowing time for spring wheat and various field crops in various regions has generally been advanced by about ten days compared to last year. At the end of March, various regions started plowing and planting wheat, and within one month, the entire region's spring wheat sowing work was completed. Now, the early-sown wheat seedlings in various regions are already half a foot tall and growing vigorously. In the warmer southern regions, weeding has already begun. Currently, the entire region is enthusiastically sowing large fields. Heilongjiang Province, the main grain-producing area, has planted more than 245,000 hectares of large fields. Liaoxi Province, the main cotton-producing area, has also planted more than 78,000 hectares of cotton fields. The southern regions of Rehe and Liaodong provinces started planting earlier. In Rehe Province, Gaoliang (sorghum), corn, soybeans, and millet have been planted in two-thirds of the fields in Qinglong, Xinglong, Luanping, Chengde and other counties. In Liaodong Province, more than half of the millet has been planted in Zhuanghe, Xinjin and other counties.
	▲ The dikes and embankments around Dongting Lake and in the fifteen counties downstream of the Xiang River in Hunan Province have been continuously reinforced over the past three years since liberation, greatly strengthening their flood control capacity. In 1949, the area of embankment fields that were affected by embankment breaches in these counties accounted for 29.3 percent of the total embankment field area, while in 1951, it was only 0.65 percent. In order to ensure that no dikes are breached and no embankments are collapsed, the lakeside counties have led farmers to reinforce embankments and repair slopes and drainage projects since last winter and this spring. All the embankments in the aforementioned counties can now be guaranteed not to collapse in the event of floods like those in 1949. At present, most of the special districts and counties in Hunan Province near Dongting Lake have also established flood control headquarters, and are actively leading farmers to prepare flood control materials and establish flood control organizations.
	▲ Wheat aphids in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province have been completely eradicated. Now the wheat seedlings are already pregnant with ears and growing very well. Farmers in various counties have created a variety of simple and effective control methods in the pest control campaign. For example, scattering plant ash or old kang (heated brick bed) soil in the wheat fields in the early morning when there is dew to kill the larvae; using reed mats with a layer of soft cloth sewn on the edges to cover the wheat seedlings and repeatedly pulling the rope to kill the insects is also very effective. When the wheat seedlings are taller, cover them with blankets or sacks and pull them along. After the wheat has jointed and eared, the farmers in Xingping County changed the blankets to cloth sheets, sewn them on wooden boards or bamboo poles, and wet them in clean water or flour water before pulling, which was also very effective. In addition, the "flour paste emulsion" mixed with flour water, kerosene, and soap used by farmers in Dali County is also very effective for spraying in wheat fields, with a pest control rate of over 90 percent.

    ▲东北各地提前种完春麦后，正大力进行大田播种。今春东北地区雨量充足，农民们在爱国增产竞赛运动的鼓舞下，生产热情极高，各地春麦和各种大田作物的播种时间，普遍比去年提前十天左右。三月末，各地开犁种麦，在一个月内，全区春麦播种工作，即全部完成。现在各地早种的麦苗，已经高达半尺，麦苗茁壮；气候较暖的南部地区，已经开始锄草。目前，全区正热烈播种大田。主要产粮区黑龙江省，已种大田二十四万五千多垧，主要产棉区辽西省也种了七万八千多垧棉田；热河、辽东两省的南部地区开种较早。热河省青龙、兴隆、滦平、承德等县的高粱、玉米、大豆、谷子，都种了三分之二；辽东省庄河、新金等县的谷子，也种上了一半以上。
    ▲湖南省洞庭湖四周和湘江下游十五个县的堤垸，经过解放后三年来不断的培修，防洪力量已大大加强。这些县一九四九年因垸堤溃决受灾的垸田面积占总垸田面积的百分之二九点三，一九五一年只有百分之零点六五。为了做到不决一堤、不溃一垸，去冬今春滨湖各县都曾领导农民培修垸堤和修护坡、排渍等工程。上述各县所有垸堤，已能保证在遇到像一九四九年一样的洪水时不致溃决。现在，湖南省靠洞庭湖的大部分专区和县也都成立了防汛指挥部，正积极领导农民准备防汛器材和建立防汛组织。
    ▲陕西关中地区的麦蚜虫已完全扑灭。现在麦苗已抱胎吐穗，生长情况极为良好。各县农民在治虫运动中创造了多种简便有效的防治方法。如在清晨麦地有露水时，撒草木灰或陈炕土，杀死幼虫；用边上缝有一层软布的芦席盖在麦苗上用绳子反复拉行杀虫的办法功效都很好。麦苗较高时，用毛毯或麻袋覆在麦苗上拉行。在麦子抽节吐穗后，兴平县农民又将毛毯改为布单，缝在木板或竹竿上，在清水或面水中沾湿再拉，也很有效。此外，大荔县农民用面水、煤油、肥皂配合的“粉糊乳剂”，在麦地里喷洒也很有效，杀虫率达百分之九十以上。
