    Czechoslovak Political Cartoons
    Demonstrate the Strong Will of the Czech People to Fight for Peace
    Comrade Editor: After visiting the "Czechoslovak Political Cartoon Exhibition" held in Beijing, I gained a deep impression. The Czechoslovak people are peace-loving and resolutely opposed to wars of aggression. This can be proven by the fact that the Czechoslovak people actively respond to the calls of the World Peace Council every time. And this exhibition has deepened our understanding of the peace activities of the Czechoslovak people. There, we can clearly see the Czech people's extreme hatred for the warmongers who launch new wars of aggression. All the cartoons strongly express a spirit of contempt for the enemy, disdain for the enemy, and hatred for the enemy. At the same time, they strongly demonstrate the unparalleled strength of the forces of peace and democracy.
    Through this exhibition, we have further learned about the people of the fraternal country of Czechoslovakia. We have a fuller understanding of the importance of strengthening the friendly relations between China and Czechoslovakia.

    捷克斯洛伐克政治讽刺画
    表现了捷克人民为和平斗争的坚强意志
    编辑同志：我参观了在北京举行的“捷克斯洛伐克政治讽刺画展览会”后，得到一个深刻的印象。捷克斯洛伐克人民是酷爱和平，坚决反对侵略战争的。这可以从捷克斯洛伐克人民每次都积极地响应世界和平理事会的号召得到证明。而这个展览会，更加深了我们对捷克斯洛伐克人民和平活动的了解。在那里，我们可以清楚地看到，捷克人民对发动新的侵略战争的战争贩子们的极端憎恨。在所有的讽刺画中都强烈地表现出蔑视敌人、鄙视敌人、仇视敌人的精神。同时也强烈地表现了和平民主力量的无比强大。
    通过这个展览会，我们更进一步地了解了兄弟国家——捷克斯洛伐克的人民。我们更充分地认识到加强中捷两国友好关系的重要性。
