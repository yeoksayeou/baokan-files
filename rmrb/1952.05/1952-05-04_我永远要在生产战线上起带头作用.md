    I Will Always Play a Leading Role on the Production Front
    To the Editor: The great "May Day" International Labor Day is here. The workers of our Tianjin Paper Mill, on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign, are celebrating "May Day" with actions to increase production and quality, and further increase production and save for the country.
    I recall that at the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers the year before last, Chairman Mao called on us to play a leading role on the production front, to play a backbone and bridge role among the masses, and to create more wealth for the motherland. I have always kept these words in mind, and I have been thinking about how to realize them. I proposed a suggestion to reduce two extra sheets of paper per ream. In the past, paper counting workers were afraid of miscounting, so they would put two extra sheets per ream, which was undoubtedly a waste. Now that my suggestion has been adopted and implemented, it is estimated that more than 100 million yuan can be saved in the first quarter. I recently put forward two more rationalization proposals. I suggested cold-made rosin soap (which used to be hot-made). The results of the laboratory test proved that the paper made with cold-made rosin soap has a stronger water resistance than that made with hot-made rosin soap, and it also saves rosin. In mid-March, I suggested installing an automatic washing felt equipment to solve the problem of mildew in the warehouse felt (used). After this suggestion was adopted and implemented, many felts can continue to be used. My contribution to production is very small, I must continue to work hard, so as not to disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations of us.

    我永远要在生产战线上起带头作用
    编辑同志：伟大的“五一”国际劳动节到来了。我们天津造纸厂的职工，在“三反”斗争胜利的基础上，以提高产量质量，进一步为国家增产节约的行动庆祝“五一”。
    我回想在前年全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议上，毛主席曾号召我们，要在生产战线上起带头作用，要在群众中起骨干及桥梁作用，为祖国创造更多的财富。这些话，我始终牢记在心，我一直想法要实现它。我提出了每令纸减少两张多余数量的建议。过去数纸工人怕数错纸，每令纸要多放两张，这无疑是一种浪费。现在我的建议被采纳实施了，估计在第一季度就可节省一亿多元。我最近又提出了两件合理化建议。我建议冷制松香皂（过去是热制的）。经化验室试验结果，证明冷制松香皂所制的纸张，抗水度比热制松香皂所制成的强，还节省了松香。三月中旬，我建议安装一个自动洗毛布设备，解决过去仓库毛布（用过的）霉烂的问题。这个建议被采纳实施后，使很多毛布能够继续使用。我对生产上的贡献是很微小的，我一定要继续努力，以不辜负毛主席对我们的期望。
