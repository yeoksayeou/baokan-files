To Better Serve the Soldiers
——A Record of the Symposium on Military Arts Held by This Newspaper
　　This newspaper convened symposia on military arts on May 16th and May 22nd, respectively, with active members, enthusiasts, and cultural officers engaged in artistic activities from the People's Liberation Army Air Force, People's Liberation Army Navy, Public Security Forces, and Air Defense Forces stationed in Beijing. A total of forty-six people participated in these two symposia. They reflected on several main problems in military arts, which were basically consistent with the situation reflected in the All-Army Cultural Minister Symposium held by the General Political Department of the Military Commission last month. The General Political Department of the Military Commission has decided that in this year and the first half of next year, the cultural work of the companies must be further improved on the basis of the past, and has decided that all army cultural cadres, art workers, professional performance troupes, and teams must without exception go deep into the companies, cooperate with the company's cultural learning, assist the company's cultural work, and carry out the company's cultural activities. In terms of the use of cultural funds, it has been decided that 60% will be directly used for the companies. The Cultural Work Troupe of the General Political Department of the Military Commission has already begun to implement this work and has been welcomed by the broad masses of commanders and fighters. Major military regions and specialized troops are also holding meetings to arrange how to implement it. The issues reflected in the symposium are reported as follows:

　　Military Art Work Must Face the Companies

　　The development of art work among the various branches of the armed forces stationed in Beijing is uneven. The companies generally lack cultural and recreational life, and art serves the soldiers insufficiently. Since entering the city, the art work of the troops has mostly floated on the upper levels. Fang Guoying of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit and Liu Xiufang of a certain regiment both reflected at the symposium that many companies had not seen performances by art troupes, let alone any guidance work done by art troupes on the cultural activities of the companies. Some soldiers in some companies, due to the dispersed locations, have not seen movies and dramas for a long time, and they can only look at movie and drama advertisements in the newspapers. Regarding the dramas performed in Beijing, Chen Zongyin of a certain unit said: "The newspaper always publishes 'sold out' advertisements. Not to mention the expensive tickets, even if you have money, you can't buy a ticket." Shi Zongshan of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit said: "Anti-aircraft artillerymen, who are responsible for major tasks, cannot leave their posts, and if the art troupes do not perform for them, they will not be able to see the show." Su Chen of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit said: "We haven't seen a movie for seven or eight months, and we haven't seen a drama for more than a year." Zhu Jianxun of a certain regiment said: "Some soldiers haven't seen a movie or drama for a year." He listed a figure: more than 50% of the soldiers in a certain company of the regiment had not seen movies and dramas due to the dispersed locations. Chen Zhe of the 1st Regiment of a certain unit said: "How much the soldiers hope that the film projection team will come to show movies, the soldiers said that if there is no screening room, they can perform in the temple, blocking the windows; otherwise, even in winter, it would be good to perform in the field. The important thing is to come often." Some troops are dispersed, without books to read or newspapers to see, let alone other entertainment. Some residences are neither close to the city nor close to the villages, and except for a few people from their own units coming in and out, they rarely see people. Liu Enpu of a certain regiment said: "The soldiers have nothing to play with, so a few people pool their money to buy a ping-pong ball, but there is no table, so they just pat it on the wall. There are operas being performed in the city theaters, but the soldiers can't go to see them." This company specially wrote a letter to the art troupe, asking the art troupe to perform for them, but the art troupe didn't even reply. Wu Tianyou of the Air Force said: "Art workers have not gone deep into our Air Force troops, and we haven't seen anything performed for a long time, and even if there are performances, they don't suit our tastes." The artistic life of the Public Security Forces is similar to theirs.

　　Ordinary soldiers love to read comic books and pictorials, but they generally reflect that there are too few reading materials available to the soldiers. Zhao Jinhua of the Communications Squad of the Navy Political Department said: "We love to read pictorials and books, but we can't get them. Sometimes we borrow them from various departments of the organs, and they have a lot there. We borrow them to read for a while, and we have to return them immediately, and sometimes they don't lend them to us, fearing they will be damaged." Some soldiers said: "I don't know what kind of books people at that level should read!" Yang Shengrong and others of the Guard Company of a certain unit of the Navy also reflected the same situation. Lv Enyi, a cadre of the Literary and Art Section of the Navy Cultural Department, had collected opinions from naval soldiers in a certain area. He said: "Soldiers can see very few reading materials, and the reading materials that should be distributed to the companies have not been distributed. Good colorful pictorials, comic books and books, etc., are deducted level by level and not distributed downwards, or the colorful parts are torn off, and the company can only see a few single-line, black and white pictures." This phenomenon is not only common in a certain unit of the Navy, but also exists to varying degrees in other branches of the armed forces and other parts.

　　Many people mentioned in their speeches that the entertainment expenses of the companies are too small, not to mention performing plays, even publishing wall newspapers is difficult. Shi Zongshan of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit said: "The monthly entertainment fee is only enough to buy some colored chalks, and we can only publish blackboard newspapers, and we can't do anything else." Many people mentioned sports equipment, Chen Shulin of the 3rd Regiment of a certain unit said: "Too few basketballs are distributed to the companies, but everyone's enthusiasm is very high. If the ball is broken, we sew it up and play again, but this still doesn't solve the problem." Many people asked to replenish basketballs in time. Zhi Guangwen of the 1st Regiment of a certain unit said: "Just sending a basketball without a hoop, we saved food expenses to buy a hoop, but if the basketball is broken, the hoop is also idle." Fang Guoying of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit said: "Soldiers are very interested in basketball. Some people are sweating profusely from growing vegetables, and they still have to dribble the ball a few times when they come back, but they just don't dribble it often, there are too few." Yang Shengrong of the Guard Company of a certain unit of the Navy said:
　　"Most of the people playing basketball there are cadres, and the soldiers don't know how to play, and they can't learn, they can only stand aside and watch. The soldiers' sports are poor, only running in the morning."

　　Soldiers are very fond of group dances, which can not only exercise physical strength, but also are not restricted by material conditions. But the difficulty is that no one teaches them. Zhi Guangwen of the 1st Regiment of a certain unit said: "We just stood on the sidelines when dancing in Tiananmen Square, wanting to dance but not knowing how, we were really anxious." Yang Shengrong of the Guard Company of a certain unit of the Navy said:
　　"Soldiers like group dances, but no one teaches them." Some ran to the cultural palace to learn, or asked students from schools to teach them a few simple dances, but they always danced those few dances, and they got tired of them. Su Chen of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit said: "In the past, we found a few young people to teach us a few dances, but now we are also tired of them, and some say: 'Children's games are not suitable for soldiers.' We wanted to learn 'Saber Dance' and 'Red Army Dance', and asked a student from a middle school to teach us, they promised but didn't come. The soldiers said: 'They don't help the soldiers' art enough.'" Some companies created some dances themselves, but they lacked guidance, could not improve, and could not be promoted, and they hoped that professional art workers would help them develop group dances more in the future. Zheng Xiaoyou and Fang Guoying of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit, Zhi Guangwen of the 1st Regiment of a certain unit, and many other comrades suggested that training classes should be established, organized for rotation training, and constantly learning new things to carry out art activities in the companies. Everyone agreed with this approach.

　　Many comrades said that the soldiers have no new songs to sing, and they sing the old songs too much; not many soldiers can read music, and they hope that professional art groups can often go down to teach them to sing. At present, there are many songs created that are not suitable for the tastes of the soldiers. This is also one of the reasons why music cannot be generally active in the companies. Sun Guangxin of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit said: "There are too few songs suitable for the troops to sing, and many songs are for art troupes and choirs to sing, and soldiers cannot sing those more complex tunes. They love to sing simple, easy to learn, and powerful songs, but there are too few such songs." Many units hope that the higher authorities will send them some musical instruments such as harmonicas, and it is best to send an accordion, they said: "We can't play and sing, but if we have something, we can learn it."

　　Art Activities in the Troops Need to Strengthen Leadership and Guidance

　　Some companies' art activities are not done well, or there are no art activities, for many reasons, among which the lack of attention from the leadership and the lack of time for art activities are common difficulties for many companies. Chen Zhe of the 1st Regiment of a certain unit said: "We are on guard at night, and we do exercises, study, and sometimes produce during the day. We can't squeeze out time for art activities all day long, and sometimes military and political cadres also compete for time." Some leading comrades have incorrect views on art activities, thinking that this is a simple play, this is a matter for intellectuals, and they do not recognize that art is a powerful weapon of propaganda and agitation. Chen Zongyin of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit said: "As long as the regimental leaders do not pay attention to art work, the lower-level cadres will not pay attention to it either. If other work is not done well, you will be criticized, but if art work is not done well, it doesn't matter." In fact, as long as the time is used well and negotiated well with each other, time can be squeezed out completely.

　　Some units have serious bureaucracy in the leadership, such as issuing entertainment equipment without considering whether the soldiers like it or whether the environment is suitable. If there is a place to play basketball, they issue baseballs." Wei Cenyuan of the Navy said that they are vigorously learning the quick literacy method there, but sometimes the time for cultural classes is taken up by other things. It has not been calculated well.

　　The soldiers urgently demand to see movies. The comrades of the film projection team do not go there often. Many soldiers said: "The film projection team should 'face the companies'." Of course, to further popularize movies, the fundamental solution is to increase the number of projection teams and increase the supply of films, but at present, the leadership and organization should also be improved. Chen Jiayin of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit and Wu Tianyou of the Air Force both suggested that in the future, full-time cadres should be set up to guide the art activities of the companies and strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level.

　　Lv Enyi of the Navy raised the issue of improper use of cadres by the leadership. He said, "Before the 'Three Antis' Movement, the Fine Arts Group of the East China Navy Cultural Department had twelve cadres, who could have gone deep into the lower levels to create for the soldiers, but the leadership put them in the organs to write slogans and arrange meeting places, doing all kinds of administrative work. Although these tasks are sometimes necessary, it is not right not to let them go to the ships to experience life, so although they are very close to the naval soldiers, they have never been there, so naturally they are not familiar with the life of the naval soldiers, how can they create things that they need and love for the soldiers?"

　　Art workers do not go deep enough into the troops, so their portrayal of the troops is not profound. Wang Zhizhong of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit said: "There is a song about anti-aircraft artillery, in which there are many 'Boom! Boom!' words, but in fact, anti-aircraft artillery is not just 'Boom!' He only learned the superficial life of the anti-aircraft artillery troops!" Lv Enyi said that some naval soldiers saw a picture of a naval soldier holding an accordion, imitating the Soviet Red Army, and the soldiers said: "The author of this picture is bragging, our naval soldiers don't have accordions!" Some painters paint the Navy, and for the sake of beauty, they always paint a Navy soldier wearing an overcoat and blown up by the wind, and the soldiers said: "If that Navy soldier wears an overcoat in any season, he must be an idiot!"

　　As long as the art activities of the troops are carried out, they will play a great role in the troops, and this point should be fully estimated. Zhang Biao of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit reflected another situation, saying that a company in their regiment had developed dancing very well, and everyone danced and sang as soon as they rested, and their mood was always full, which promoted military training, and this company was rated as a model company in the regiment.

　　Companies Need Short and Popular Literary Works

　　Everyone agreed that the current literary works do not portray soldiers very well, especially popular literary readings, comic books, and short and concise dramas that can be accepted by soldiers, which are far from meeting the needs of soldiers. After the quick literacy method is universally promoted in the troops, illiteracy in the troops will be completely eliminated in a short period of time. Li Zizhi of the Guard Division of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Corps said: "At that time, the soldiers' requirements for art will be higher and more universal." Zhao Jinhua of the Communications Squad of the Navy Political Department said: "The soldiers ask writers to go deep into the companies to train soldiers to write, and to write for the soldiers." In the past, many companies were self-written, self-directed, and self-performed, which played a great role in the popularization of art in the troops and in the propaganda and education of soldiers, but because "soldiers performing as soldiers" did not receive the necessary help and guidance, they could not improve and break through, and they produced depression. Zheng Xiaoyou of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit said that there is a popular saying among the soldiers in the company now: "Soldiers performing as soldiers, it's really rare, criticized under the stage, and criticized on the stage." Yang Chengqi of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Corps said: "Now soldiers performing as soldiers is old-fashioned. Although the soldiers have life, they cannot get guidance and cannot improve." Zhou Chuanzheng of the 5th Regiment of a certain unit raised the issue of actors and the inability to improve acting skills: "There must be men and women in a play to be like a family, but soldiers can't play female roles well, the old lady walking as an old lady doesn't look like an old lady, and the woman playing doesn't have hair, the top is performing, and the bottom is laughing." Now the soldiers' appreciation level has improved, and "soldiers performing as soldiers" must improve one step in both scriptwriting and performance to meet the needs of the soldiers. From everyone's speeches, there is a common opinion, that is: I hope that professional art workers and art troupes will often go deep into the companies to provide guidance, and not become a blitz, but also organize more company observation performances and establish training classes.

　　Speaking of this, many comrades mentioned that there are too few short and concise scripts suitable for soldiers to perform, and they generally feel that there is a shortage of scripts. They hope that writers will create more short scripts, and they hope that professional art groups will perform more small plays to lead them. Ji Yin of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Corps said: "Large-scale operas such as 'The Long March' and 'Strike the Aggressors' have a certain educational significance, but this can only be performed by professional art groups, and we hope to see small plays that we can observe."

　　Tao Guotang of the 2nd Regiment of a certain unit suggested that "Liberation Army Literature" should set up a guiding column for soldiers' literary creation, and regularly publish soldiers' works, pointing out what is good about the work and what are the shortcomings. By doing this, soldiers' literary creation will be slowly cultivated and improved. In the past, although "Liberation Army Literature" was sent to the companies, there were many works that soldiers could read, but because there was no planned and led organization of reading, the effect was not great. Compared with "Comrade-in-Arms", the soldiers in the company feel that "Liberation Army Literature" is for cadres to read, and they prefer to read the more popular "Comrade-in-Arms". "Liberation Army Pictorial" is also rarely distributed to the soldiers in the company, and ordinary soldiers can only look at the pictures, and they feel that the explanatory text is not popular enough.

    要更好地为兵服务
    ——记本报召开的部队文艺座谈会
    本报于五月十六日、五月二十二日分别召开了驻京机关部队的文艺座谈会，参加这两次座谈会的有驻京的中国人民解放军空军、中国人民解放军海军、公安部队和防空部队中的文艺活动积极分子、文艺爱好者、文娱干事等，共四十六人。他们反映了部队文艺中的几个主要问题，这些问题基本上是符合军委总政治部上月所召开的全军文化部长座谈会所反映的情况的。军委总政治部已决定今年及明年上半年一定要把连队的文化工作在过去的基础上更进一步搞好，并决定全军文化干部、文艺工作者、专业文工团、队毫无例外地必须深入连队，配合连队的文化学习，辅导连队的文化工作，开展连队的文化活动。在文化经费使用上决定以十分之六的数字直接使用到连队。军委总政治部文工团已经开始执行这一工作，并受到部队广大指战员的欢迎。各大军区，特种兵亦正在开会布置如何贯彻。兹将座谈会所反映的问题报道如下：
    部队文艺工作要面向连队
    文艺工作在驻京部队的各个兵种间的发展是不平衡的，连队一般地缺乏文化娱乐生活，文艺为兵服务还很不够，部队的文艺工作入城以来浮在上层的较多。某部五团的房国英，某团的刘秀芳等都在座谈会上反映，许多连队都没有看见过文工团的演出，当然也谈不到文工团对连队文艺活动做过些什么辅导工作了。有些连队的战士由于驻地分散，很长时间没有看见电影和戏剧，他们只能看看报纸上的电影戏剧广告。关于北京演出的戏剧，某部的陈宗荫说：“报上总是登着‘客满’的广告。不说票贵，即使有钱也买不到票。”某部二团石宗善说：“高射炮兵，担任主要任务的不能远离工作岗位，文工团队不去给他们演出，他们就无法看到戏。”某部二团苏臣说：“我们七、八个月没有看到电影了，一年多没看到话剧了。”某团朱建训说：“有的战士一年没看到电影和戏剧了。”他列举了一个数目字：该团某连队因驻地分散，百分之五十以上的人没有看到电影和戏剧。某部一团陈喆说：“战士多么希望电影放映队去给演演电影啊，战士们说没有放映室可以在庙里演，把窗户堵上；不然，就是冬天，野地演也很好。重要的是要常来。”有的部队分散，既没有书读，也没有报看，别的娱乐更谈不上。有的住处既不靠城，也不靠村庄，除去自己单位的几个人出来进去之外，连人都很少看到。某团刘恩普说：“战士们没有什么玩，几个人凑钱买个乒乓球，没有台子，就在墙上拍拍。城内戏院里唱戏，战士们不能去看。”他们这个连队曾特地给文工团写信，要求文工团去给他们演演戏，但文工团连个回信也没有。空军部队吴天佑说：“文艺工作者就没有深入我们空军部队，很长时间也没见演出什么东西，即使演出，也不合我们的口味。”公安部队的文艺生活也和他们差不多。
    一般战士最爱看连环图画和画报，但他们普遍反映：战士能看到的读物太少。海军政治部通讯班赵金华说：“画报、书刊我们最爱看，但捞不着看。有时我们到机关各部门去借，他们那里却有不少。我们借来看一下，马上得还，有时还不借给我们，怕弄坏了。”有的战士就说：‘不知道那一级的人该看什么样的书！’”海军某部警卫连杨生荣等也反映了同一情况。海军文化部文艺科干部吕恩谊，曾在某地区海军战士中收集过意见，他说：“战士能看到的读物极少，应该发到连队去的读物，没有发下去。好的带彩色的画报、连环图画和书刊等，被逐级层层扣压下来不往下发，或者撕去了五彩的部分，连队里能看到的只有很少几本单线条的，黑白的图画。”这种现象不但在海军某部中普遍存在，其他兵种其他部分也或多或少地有这种现象。
    许多人在发言中都提到连队的文娱经费太少，不用说演戏，就是出墙报都困难。某部二团石宗善说：“每月的文娱费只够买一些带色粉笔，只可出出黑板报，别的什么也干不了。”有许多人提到体育器材，某部三团陈书林说：“发到连队的篮球太少，但是大家情绪很高，球破了，缝上再打，但这仍然解决不了问题。”许多人要求及时补发篮球。某部一团支广文说：“光发个篮球，不发框子，我们节约了伙食费买个框子，但篮球坏了，框子也闲起来了。”某部五团房国英说：“战士对篮球兴趣很大，有的去种菜累的满头大汗，回来还要摔两下，但就是摔不常，太少。”海军某部警卫连杨生荣说：
    “我们那里打篮球，大部分是干部，战士不会，也摸不着学，只有站在一边看。战士的体育运动差，只有早上跑跑步。”
    战士对集体舞蹈非常喜欢，既可锻炼体力，又不受物质条件限制。但困难的是没有人教。某部一团支广文说：“天安门跳舞，我们光溜边站着，想跳又不会，心里真着急。”海军某部警卫连杨生荣说：
    “战士喜欢集体舞，就是没人教。”有的跑到文化宫去学，或请学校里的学生教几种简单的舞蹈，但跳来跳去总是那几种，就跳腻了。某部二团苏臣说：“过去找几个青年教我们几种舞，现在也厌烦了，有的说：‘小孩的玩艺，不适合大兵。’想学‘马刀舞’‘红军舞’，请一个中学里的学生教，他们答应了却没有来。战士们说：‘他们对兵的文艺帮助不够。’”有的连队自己创作了一些舞蹈，但缺乏指导，不能提高，也不能推广，他们希望专业文艺工作者今后多帮助他们开展集体舞蹈。某部五团郑小友、房国英，某部一团支广文等许多同志都提出应成立训练班，组织轮训，不断学习新东西向连队开展文艺活动。大家都赞成这样做。
    许多同志说战士没有新歌唱，唱来唱去还是老歌子多；战士中能认谱的不多，他们盼望专业文艺团体能经常下去教他们唱。目前歌曲创作中，有不少是不适合战士的口味。这也是音乐不能在连队普遍活跃的原因之一。某部二团孙广欣说：“适合部队唱的歌太少了，有许多歌子是给文工团、合唱团唱的，战士唱不了那些比较复杂的曲子。他们爱唱简单易学，雄壮有力的歌子，但这种歌子太少了。”不少单位盼望上级给他们发一些口琴之类的乐器，最好是发一个手风琴，他们说：“我们不会拉唱，有了东西，就可以学呀。”
    部队文艺活动需要加强领导和辅导
    有的连队的文艺活动搞的不好，或没有文艺活动，原因很多，其中领导不够重视和没有文艺活动时间，是不少连队的共同困难。某部一团陈喆说：“我们夜间站岗，白天上操，学习，有时生产，一天到晚挤不出文艺活动时间，有时军政干部还争时间。”有些领导同志对文艺活动存在着不正确的看法，认为这是简单的玩玩，这是知识分子们的事，没有认识文艺是有力的宣传、鼓动的武器。某部五团陈宗荫说：“只要团首长对文艺工作不重视，下面的各级干部也连带不重视了。别的工作作不好要受批评，文艺工作作不好没关系。”其实时间只要运用得好，互相好好协商一下，时间是完全可以挤得出来的。
    有的单位领导方面的官僚主义很严重，如发文娱器材不看战士是否喜欢，环境是否适用，能打篮球的地方，发给棒球。”海军魏岑远说，他们那里学习速成识字法正起劲，可是有时上文化课的时间被别的事占了去。没有很好计算。
    战士们迫切要求看电影。电影放映队的同志却去得不多。好些战士说：“电影放映队应‘面向连队’。”当然，要使电影进一步的普及，其根本解决的办法是增加放映队，增加影片供应，但是目前也应该就领导组织方面加以改进。某部五团陈家荫和空军吴天佑都分别提出今后应设辅导连队文艺活动的专职干部和加强基层领导的问题。
    海军吕恩谊提出了领导上使用干部不当的问题。他说，“三反”前华东海军文化部有个美术组，有十二个干部，本可以深入下面为兵创作，但领导上却把他们放在机关里写写标语，布置布置会场，尽搞些事务工作，虽然这些工作有时也必要，但不放他们到舰艇里去体验生活，是不应该的，所以他们虽然离海军战士很近，但他们从来没有去过，自然不熟悉海军战士的生活，怎能为兵创作出他们所需要和爱好的东西来呢？
    文艺工作者由于深入部队不够，因此他们表现部队时也就不深刻。某部五团王志忠说：“有一个关于高射炮的歌子，其中很多‘轰?！轰?！’的字眼，其实高射炮并不只是‘轰?’。他只学了高射炮部队的生活皮毛！”吕恩谊说，有些海军战士看到一幅画海军战士的图画上，仿照苏联红军的样子拿着手风琴，战士说：“这幅画的作者净吹牛，我们海军战士那里有手风琴！”有的绘画者画海军，为了好看，总画一个海军披着大衣被风吹飘起来，战士说：“如果我们那个海军战士不论什么季节都穿着大衣，那他一定是个傻瓜！”
    部队的文艺活动，只要开展起来，就对部队起很大作用，这点，应该充分加以估计。某部二团张标反映了另一种情况，他说他们团有一个连队舞蹈开展得很好，一休息大家就跳呀唱呀，情绪一直很饱满，对练兵起了推动作用，这个连在团内被评为模范连。
    连队需要短小通俗的文艺作品
    大家一致感到目前的文艺作品表现兵非常不够，尤其为战士所能接受的通俗文艺读物、连环图画、短小精练的戏剧等，远远不能满足战士的要求。速成识字法在部队普遍推行后，部队中的文盲将在不久的一个时期内完全消灭。北京市公安总队警卫师李自治说：“那时，战士对文艺的要求就更高、更普遍了。”海军政治部通讯班赵金华说：“战士要求作家深入连队培养战士写作，并为战士写作。”过去许多连队都是自编自导自演，在部队文艺的普及工作上和对战士进行宣传教育上都起了不少作用，但因“兵演兵”得不到应有的帮助和指导，提不高，突不破，产生了苦闷。某部五团郑小友说，现在连队战士中流行着一句话：“兵演兵，真稀松，台下受批评，台上也受批评。”北京市公安总队杨承祺说：“现在兵演兵成老一套了。战士虽有生活，但得不到指导，提不高。”某部五团周传正，提出了演员问题和演技不能提高的问题：“一个戏里总要有男有女才像一家人家，但战士演女角演不好，扮老太婆的走路不像老太婆，演妇女的没头发，上面演，下面笑。”现在战士的欣赏水平提高了，“兵演兵”无论编剧和演出，都要提高一步才能满足战士的要求。从大家的发言中，有一个相同的意见，就是：希望专业文艺工作者，文工团队经常深入连队进行辅导，不要成为突击，还要多组织连队观摩演出，成立训练班。
    谈到这里，许多同志提到目前适合战士演出的短小精悍的剧本太少了，普遍感到剧本荒。他们希望作家多创作短小的剧本，更希望专业文工团体，多演些小戏，给他们引引路。北京市公安总队纪因说：“像‘长征’‘打击侵略者’的大型歌剧，有它一定的教育意义，但这只有专业文工团体才能演出，我们希望看看小戏，可以观摩一下。”
    某部二团陶国唐建议“解放军文艺”设立战士文艺创作指导栏，经常刊登战士的作品，指出该作品好在那里，缺点是什么。这样作，战士的文艺创作就会慢慢得到培养和提高。过去“解放军文艺”虽发到连队，有不少战士可以读的作品，但因为没有有计划有领导地组织阅读，所以效果还不大。比起“战友”来，连队战士觉得“解放军文艺”是给干部看的，他们喜欢看比较通俗的“战友”。“解放军画报”发到连队战士中去的也很少，一般战士只能看画，觉得说明文字还不通俗。
