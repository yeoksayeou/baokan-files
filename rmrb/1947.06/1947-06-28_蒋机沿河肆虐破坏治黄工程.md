[This article was] Transmitted from the Jilu Yu Border Region on the 25th [of June] by this newspaper: On the eve of the major flood season, Chiang Kai-shek's troops and planes are stepping up their sabotage of the Yellow River control projects in the Liberated Areas, plotting to breach the dikes and cause disaster. In the one month from May 12th to June 12th, Chiang's planes raided the 4th Repair and Defense Section area, encompassing twenty counties including Pingyin and Dong'a, twelve times, each time dispatching one or two planes. The bombs they dropped weighed over 100 pounds each. Five dike repair workers were wounded and one stone-transporting vehicle was destroyed. During the same period, Chiang's troops harassed [the area] sixty-four times, firing two hundred and twenty-six shells, killing three dike repair workers. On June 6th, they also abducted over two hundred dike repair workers from Yan Nali in Kunshan (Xin County, originally parts of Dongping and Yuncheng).
