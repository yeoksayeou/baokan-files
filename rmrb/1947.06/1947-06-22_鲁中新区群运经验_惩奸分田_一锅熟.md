Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th. The Zichuan area of the newly recovered Lu Zhong district has gained the following experiences in the two-month anti-traitor revenge land reform movement: (1) Vigorously suppress armed secret agents, arrest bad elements, and suppress evil influences, and let the masses handle them freely. Since then, righteousness has been uplifted, and the enthusiasm of the masses has been enhanced. The masses in Kunlun and other districts ran hundreds of miles to capture escaped secret agents and bad elements, and liquidated them, quickly opening the door to land reform. (2) Convene a large number of poor and hired peasant representative conferences, and train a large number of poor and hired peasant activists. Take the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, and overcome the petty actions of cadres who only see the immediate production interests of the poor and hired peasants and dare not boldly train the hired and poor peasants on a large scale. The county held a conference of 20,000 poor and hired peasants, and through them, quickly raised the consciousness of the masses, and the movement was fully launched. (3) Firmly grasp the two major demands of the masses in the newly recovered areas: punishing traitors and land reform, and adopt the method of "one pot cooked." While suppressing secret agents, convene conferences of poor and hired peasants to announce the regulations on punishing traitors and the land reform laws. After hearing this, the masses immediately beat gongs and drums, publicized it everywhere, and shouted: "First, we want land, and second, we punish bad elements."

　　鲁中新区群运经验
    惩奸分田“一锅熟”
    【新华社山东十九日电】鲁中新收复区淄川在两个月反奸复仇土地改革运动中获得如下经验：（一）大力清剿武装特务，逮捕坏蛋，镇压邪气，并放手交群众处理。从此正气昂扬，群众积极性提高。昆仑等区群众跑到数百里外捕回漏网特务坏蛋，向其清算，迅速打开土地改革大门。（二）大量召开贫雇农代表大会、培养大批贫雇农积极分子，以贫雇农为骨干，并要克服干部只看到贫雇农眼前的生产利益，不敢大胆的大量培养集训雇贫农的小手小脚作风。该县由于举行了两万贫雇农的大会，通过他们，迅速提高了群众觉悟，运动即全面开展起来。（三）紧紧抓住新收复区群众惩奸土地改革两大要求，采取“一锅熟”的办法。一面清剿特务，一面召集贫雇农大会，宣布惩奸条例与土地改革法令，群众听后立即敲锣打鼓，四处宣传，高呼：“第一要土地，第二治坏蛋。”
