Live a Thrifty Life and Don't Worry About Hardship
Jincheng Village Cadres Take the Lead in Saving
Masses in Various Villages Form a Surge of Replenishing and Seizing Planting

[This newspaper reports] Jincheng is vigorously organizing a county-wide production, savings, and famine-preparedness campaign, putting forward the slogans: "This year's harvest has been reduced, don't forget the famine of 1932, quickly engage in production and savings," "Famine fears the tail, not the head, a little at a time, and you won't worry about life." The Fifth District convened a joint meeting of district and village cadres on June 3rd, with 43 people participating, to study and implement methods. At the meeting, it was found that cadres and the masses had many resistant ideas about drought prevention and famine relief: "Dry planting rots, spot planting dies, just wait for the rain." "Seeing the seedlings is like a third of the harvest, the famine isn't too serious." "The Eighth Route Army won't let anyone starve to death, if there is a famine, the government will definitely find a way to help." "We are used to eating millet and white flour, bran and vegetables are useless, we can't eat bran and vegetables." "Planting land is not as good as 'running pick' (meaning transportation), don't worry about catching the seedlings, 'running pick' a few times will solve the problem." Discovering the above ideas, the discussion was further turned to, using specific accounting to alert everyone, admitting that the famine has now taken root and cannot be paralyzed anymore. Then they recalled the horror of the great famine of 1932. Everyone unanimously felt that in order to live, act quickly, waiting for rain like in 1932 will kill people! The final decision was: (1) Guide the masses to recall the pain of the 1932 famine, so that the masses can become aware of famine relief themselves. (2) Cadres must act first, then the masses will believe. The village chief of Beicun made a review: I once promoted "saving food and preparing for famine" in the village, but I ate dry mixed rice, and the masses immediately reflected: The village chief said to prevent drought and famine relief, it is a public matter from the district, and must be done. (3) Organize to call on the entire district to focus on drought prevention and famine relief as the current work center, one person should keep alive ten (replanted) pumpkins, full labor should keep alive one hundred corn stalks, women should keep alive fifty corn stalks, and plant five pumpkins. Each person saves one he of millet a day. (4) Prepare for late planting quickly, harvest as soon as the wheat yellows, and seize the rain to replant. In order to respond to the famine preparedness call, the Xinbi base point in the Third District convened a meeting of village cadres from the entire base point. First of all, everyone reflected on the past waste. Wang Cuntu, chairman of the Chuandi Village Farmers' Association, said: "The waste in the village is mainly caused by our cadres, I made more than 90,000 yuan selling soybean cakes last June, and bought more than 30 dan of wheat, I felt that I had money, and I wanted to do things like a funeral director, thinking that I had suffered all my life as a funeral director, in the past the landlords and bullies were 'gedou' (meaning imposing), now that I have turned over, I should also 'gedou' 'gedou'! So I called a group of monks, ten drummers, and held a big event for three days. A total of 280 people, including village militias, women's teams, all cadres, and even relatives and friends, participated. When the masses saw that we were doing it big, they felt embarrassed to offer a gift of 200 yuan, and some offered 500 yuan. After the event, it was calculated that it cost more than 120,000 yuan. Now I think about it, I really regret it. I wasted it, and I asked the masses to follow our waste. If the event was small, two dan of wheat would be enough, and the remaining grain for my family of four would be enough for me to eat for five years." Comrade Xinbi Gengzheng said: "Regarding waste, we don't care about it, we want to eat good things when we earn money, our wives wear fancy shoes, and our children wear fancy hats, which is a lot of waste." Then everyone reflected one after another. After reflecting, everyone unanimously said: "Prevent drought every year, prevent theft every night," we should practice thrift, store bran and accumulate vegetables, and prepare for famine. All our cadres need to set an example in our work, and the plan is as follows: (1) Cadres will no longer waste in the future, and will lead the masses to save together; (2) Mobilize women not to wear fancy clothes, spend the remaining time on production, store bran and accumulate vegetables for a long-term plan; (3) Completely replenish the valley fields without seedlings within five days. After the meeting, all the cadres immediately led the masses to take action. On the 9th and 10th, there was some rain, and replenishment and rush planting formed a surge.

　　细水长流生活不发愁
    晋城村干带头节约
    各村群众补种抢种形成热潮
    【本报讯】晋城正大力组织全县规模的生产、节约、备荒运动，提出“今年收成已减少，三十二年灾荒忘不了，生产节约赶快搞”“灾荒怕尾不怕头，细水长流，生活不发愁”，五区于六月三日召开了区村干部联席会议，共四十三人参加，研究贯彻办法，会上发现干部及群众对防旱渡荒有许多抵抗思想：“干种坏，点种死，只有等下雨。”“见苗三分收，灾荒还不要紧。”“八路军不让饿死人，遭了灾荒政府一定想法来救济。”“小米白面吃惯了，糠菜不济事，糠菜也就吃不了。”“种地不如‘跑挑’（运输的意思），没捉住苗不怕，‘跑挑’几回就有办法。”发现以上思想，即进一步转入讨论，用具体算账警惕了大家，承认现在灾荒已扎下根了，不可再麻痹。接着回想到了三十二年大灾荒的可怕。一致觉得要想活，快动手，三十二年等雨害死人呀！最后决定：（一）引导群众回想三十二年灾荒的痛苦，让群众自己觉悟起来渡荒。（二）干部先动手，群众才相信，北村村长作了检讨：我有次在村宣传“节省粮食，准备渡荒。”可是我却吃的干捞饭，群众即反映：人家村长说防旱渡荒，是区上来的公事，不得不办。（三）组织起来，号召全区当前工作即以防旱渡荒为中心，一个人种活十棵（再种）南瓜，全劳力看活一百棵玉茭，妇女看活五十棵玉茭，种活五棵南瓜。每个人一天省一合小米。（四）快预备晚种，麦黄即割，乘雨抢种。三区辛壁基点为了响应备荒号召，召集了全基点村干部会议，首先大家反省过去的浪费，川底村农会主席王存土说：“村里浪费主要是咱干部闹坏了，我去年六月买卖豆饼赚了九万多块钱，买了三十多石小麦，我觉得有了钱，要出殡当家，想着我当家在世受了一辈子罪，过去地主恶霸‘圪抖’（威风的意思），我现在翻了身也‘圪抖’‘圪抖’吧！于是叫了一班和尚，十个鼓手，办了三天大事，村里民兵、妇女队和全体干部，连上亲戚朋友共有二百八十几个人参加，群众看见咱办的大，封礼钱二百元还觉着拿不出门来，有的就封五百元，事毕一算账就花了十二万块钱还多，现在我想起来真是后悔，自己浪费了，叫群众也跟上咱浪费，要是事办小的话，两石麦子就够了，一共我家四口人余下的粮食就够我五年吃。”辛壁根正同志说：“关于浪费，咱们都不在意，赚回钱来想吃好的，媳妇穿花鞋，小孩扎花帽，浪费很大。”接着你一言我一语都反省起来，反省后，大家一致说：“年年防旱，夜夜防盗”，我们厉行节约，屯糠积菜，防备灾荒，一切工作咱干部需要起模范，计划如下：（一）干部今后再不浪费，领导群众一齐节约；（二）动员妇女不扎花，余下时间搞生产，屯糠积菜长打算；（三）在五日内将没苗的谷完全补种齐。会后各干部即领导群众行动起来，到了九日、十日下了些雨，补种抢种即形成热潮。
