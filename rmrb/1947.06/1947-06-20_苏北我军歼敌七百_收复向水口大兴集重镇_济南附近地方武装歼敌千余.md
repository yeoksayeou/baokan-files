Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th—A unit of the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army crossed the Yu-Huang River to the north and successively captured the important town of Xiangshuikou on the south bank of Henan and Daxingji, the connecting point of the Tongyu Highway and the Lian (Shui) Xin (Anzhen) Highway, on the 5th and 6th of this month. It killed, wounded, and captured 700 troops of Xu Ni Jitaibu and local Chiang Kai-shek puppets, seized one mortar, two small cannons, four machine guns, one grenade launcher, over a hundred long and short guns, 170,000 rounds of ammunition, and over ten loads of Western medicine. The Northern Jiangsu Daily editorial commented: This is another major victory following the great victory of the Northern Jiangsu Liberation Army in annihilating 1,400 enemies in the counterattack on Tongyu Road in late last month, indicating that the Northern Jiangsu Chiang Kai-shek rear people's armed forces are capable of continuously annihilating the enemy. The editorial stated: Just as Chiang's army's 44th Division was gathering five regiments to carry out retaliatory "mopping-up" operations in the Huai'an, Funing, and Jianyang areas, the Liberation Army dealt a heavy blow to its flanks, forcing the "mopping-up" enemy to retreat north, and its conspiracy to concentrate forces to invade the central area has been completely shattered. The people's armed forces continue to maintain the initiative in the struggle behind enemy lines.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 17th—A certain unit of the Bohai People's Local Armed Forces has advanced into the suburbs of Jinan in recent months, and has captured Guodian on the Jiaoji Railway northeast of Jinan and Dangjiazhuang Station on the Jinpu Railway southwest of the city. This unit has fought in the vast area from the Yellow River in the north to Jiaoji in the south, fighting fifty times. In the third district of Zhangqiu, it inflicted heavy casualties on the Chiang Kai-shek county brigades gathered in Qidong, Zhangqiu, Jiyang, Shanghe, Huimin, Licheng and other counties. It is estimated that over a thousand people were killed, captured and seized, along with their guns, as well as one heavy machine gun, fifteen light machine guns, one mortar, two small cannons, and over 100,000 jin of grain.

　　苏北我军歼敌七百
    收复向水口大兴集重镇
    济南附近地方武装歼敌千余
    【新华社华中十八日电】苏北人民解放军一部北渡淤黄河，于本月五日六日相继攻克了河南岸重镇向水口及通榆公路与涟（水）新（安镇）公路连结点大汇集。毙伤俘徐逆继泰部及土著蒋伪七百人，缴迫击炮一门，小炮二门，机枪四挺，掷弹筒一个，长短枪百余支，枪炮弹十七万发及西药十余担。苏北日报社论评称：此为继上月下旬苏北解放军反击通榆路歼敌千四百名大捷后之又一重大胜利。说明苏北蒋后人民武装能够连续歼敌。社论称：正当蒋军四十四师凑集五个团兵力向淮安、阜宁、建阳地区进行报复“扫荡”之际，解放军在其侧背予以沉重打击，逼使“扫荡”之敌纷纷北退，其集中兵力侵扰中心区的阴谋已完全破灭。人民武装则仍继续保持了敌后斗争的主动权。
