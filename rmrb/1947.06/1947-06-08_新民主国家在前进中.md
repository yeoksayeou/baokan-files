　　New Democratic Countries Are Moving Forward
    Yugoslavia
    New People Are Growing
    National Unity is Strong and Solid
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] TASS, Belgrade: Marshal Tito, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Yugoslavia, recently met with a delegation of Bulgarian journalists and stated, "Many things have changed in our country. In the process of construction, new cadres are emerging, and new people are growing. Last year, the construction of the railway in Bosnia Province contributed greatly to the training of new young worker cadres. The joint work of the young people building the railway from various regions greatly promoted unity; this is the characteristic of the relationship between the brotherly nations of Yugoslavia. More achievements will be made this year. For us, not only are these material achievements important, but also the achievements in forming a new society. Every individual in our country has his own personality, but together they form a united, strong, and solid group. Simply abolishing borders is not enough to solve the national question. This question needs to be resolved in the spirit of the nation, in the minds and hearts of the people. We are solving this problem in this way." When Bulgarian journalists asked Marshal Tito to explain the People's Front, Marshal Tito said, "The People's Front arose before the war in the struggle against fascist reaction and to defend the motherland. During the war, it became the main pillar of those who organized and led the struggle. It has grown in our country and gained a mass base, which guaranteed our victory in the struggle against the enemy. We should not ignore the fact that the Communist Party assumed the responsibility of leadership, it was the main organizer, and it participated in the People's Front. The People's Front is also the main foundation for defending our country, and it is increasingly acquiring the nature of a new nationwide organization in the struggle against aggressors and Quisling elements. Seeing the traitorous behavior of the rulers of the old Yugoslavia, the People's Front launched a relentless struggle against the enemy and domestic reactionaries to create a new social system.

    Bulgaria
    Under the Leadership of the Fatherland Front
    Rapid Economic and Cultural Progress
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] Moscow Dispatch: Red Star observer Rostov recently discussed the rapid progress of Bulgaria's economic recovery and emphasized the remarkable achievements of the Fatherland Front government. He said: This front is an alliance of the working class, peasants, artisans, and people's intellectuals. By the end of 1946, industrial production had exceeded the pre-war level by eight percent. All factories have been reopened, many new factories have also been established, and unemployment has been completely eliminated. The monetary reform was implemented in March, the country's financial situation has greatly improved, and the volume of domestic trade has greatly increased. The establishment of trade relations with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Switzerland, France, Romania, and other countries has consolidated Bulgaria's foreign trade. Agricultural production will exceed the pre-war level by thirty-four percent by 1948. Poor peasants will receive land from the national land fund. There are now twenty tractor stations and approximately five hundred agricultural cooperatives cultivating 200,000 hectares of land; at the same time, private ownership of farms is still retained. Despite the reactionaries' attempts to spread doubts among the people about the possibility of completing the two-year economic plan without foreign aid and large foreign loans, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Fatherland Front government, are confidently advancing along the road of economic and cultural progress.

　　新民主国家在前进中
    南斯拉夫
    新的人民在成长着
    全国团结强大坚实
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫部长会议主席铁托元帅顷接见保加利亚新闻记者代表团，并称：“在我国许多事情都已改变了，在建设工作的过程中，新的干部在涌现着，新的人民在成长着。去年波斯尼亚省肆建铁路，在训练新的青年工人干部上，贡献很大。来自各个区域建筑铁路的青年们的共同工作，大大地促进了团结；这就是南斯拉夫各民族兄弟间之关系的特征。今年则将有更多的成就。对于我们，不仅这种物质成就是重要的，而且关于组成新社会的成就，也是重要的。我们国家里的每一个人各有他自己的个性，但是他们大家合在一起，就形成一个团结的强大的坚实的团体。单单废除边界是不足以解决民族问题的。这个问题需要在民族的精神上，在人民的思想和内心里谋得解决。我们正在用这一方法解决着这一问题。”保加利亚记者们请铁托元帅解释一下人民阵线，铁托元帅说：“在战前反对法西斯反动和保卫祖国的斗争中，人民阵线就已兴起了。战争期间，它成为那些组织和领导斗争的人们的主要支柱。它在我国已经成长而且获得群众基础，这保证了我们对敌斗争的胜利。我们不应该忽视这个事实：共产党是负了领导的责任的，它是主要的组织者，它参加了人民阵线。人民阵线也是保卫我们国家的主要基础，它在反对侵略者反对吉斯林分子的斗争中日益具备全国范围的新组织的性质。人民阵线看到旧南斯拉夫统治者的叛国行为，就发动了反对敌人和国内反动派的无情斗争，以创立新的社会制度。
    保加利亚
    在祖国阵线领导下
    经济文化进展迅速
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：红星报观察家罗斯托夫顷论述保加利亚经济恢复的迅速进展，并着重指出祖国阵线政府的惊人成就。他说：这一阵线是工人阶级、农民、手工业者及人民的知识分子之联盟。一九四六年年底，工业产量已超过战前水平百分之八。一切工厂都已重行开工，许多新工厂也已建立，失业现象已完全消除。三月间实现了货币改革，国家财政情况已大为改善，国内贸易额已大大地增加。对苏、捷、南、波、瑞士、法、罗及其他国家贸易关系的建立，巩固了保加利亚的对外贸易。农业生产到一九四八年要超过战前水平百分之三十四。贫农将从国家土地基金中领得地。现在有二十个拖拉机站和约五百个农业合作社耕种着二十万海格脱土地；同时农场的个人私有权仍然被保留。尽管反动派力图在人民中间散布对没有外力援助和大量外国贷款而完成两年经济计划的可能性之怀疑，但保加利亚人民仍在祖国阵线政府领导下，沿着经济和文化进步的道路深具信心地前进着。
