　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 30th. Guangming Township in Dongtai is the stepping stone of the Libao stronghold. Six out of ten villages in the township are closely connected to the street, and the farthest village is only two or three li away from the street. After the Chiang army reoccupied Libao, they frantically went to the countryside to rob and kill, at least once a day. However, in the first ten days of this month, the township still vigorously carried out the re-investigation. So far, the township has basically ended. During the land investigation stage, 300 mu of hidden land were found in the four villages, the masses were initially mobilized, the majority of the rural population was united, and the militia was developed. The following experiences were gained in the movement: (1) Organize two sets of forces and clarify the division of labor. One is the re-investigation organization headed by the instructor and the township head, including the re-investigation committee members, the poor and hired peasants who did not get enough land, and the activists in the land reform; the other is the armed organization headed by the captain, mainly composed of the armed work team and the militia, with combat groups, plainclothes reconnaissance groups, and communication liaison groups. After the re-investigation started, the plainclothes reconnaissance group ambushed the main roads. Once there was a situation, they immediately notified the combat group to carry out activities, and at the same time notified the re-investigation group to move. From May 1st to 8th, in eight days, they repelled the local Chiang Kai-shek puppets who went to the countryside to rob more than eight times, resisted more than a thousand enemies, and enabled the township to carry out the re-investigation safely. (2) Conduct education and enlightenment based on the concerns of the masses. The biggest concern of the people in the border area is the fear of local Chiang Kai-shek puppets going to the countryside to rob. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the news of victory and encourage the masses' confidence in victory. (3) Seize all the gaps and quickly complete the re-investigation. The environment in this area is unstable, and the leadership seizes the opportunity for the masses to "run away" and holds small-scale meetings to talk casually. For example, more than 100 mu of hidden land in a village were found during casual conversations with the masses when "running away".

　　苏中李堡据点附近胜利完成武装查田
    【新华社华中三十日电】东台光明乡是李堡据点的踏脚板，全乡十个村有六个村紧接街头，最远的村离街亦仅二三里。蒋军复占李堡后，疯狂下乡抢劫烧杀，每天至少一次，但在本月上旬该乡仍热火朝天的开展了复查。至目前止，全乡已初步结束。查田阶段的四个村复查出黑地三百亩，初步发动了群众，团结了农村大多数，发展了民兵。运动中获得如下经验：（一）组织两套力量，明确分工。一种是以指导员、乡长为首的复查组织，包括复查委员，得田不足的贫雇农，及土地改革中的积极分子；一种是以大队长为首的武装组织，主要是武工队及民兵组成，下设战斗组、便衣侦察组、通讯联络组等。复查开始后，便衣侦察组即埋伏大路要路，一有情况，立即通知战斗组前去活动，一面通知复查组机动转移。自五月一至八日八天中，即八次击退下乡土著蒋伪，抗击了千余以上的敌人，使该乡复查安然进行。（二）针对群众顾虑进行教育启发，边乡群众最大的顾虑是怕土著蒋伪下乡抢掠，因此必须大力宣传胜利消息，鼓舞群众胜利信心。（三）抓紧一切空隙，迅速完成复查。该地环境不安定，领导上即抓紧群众“跑反”时机，召开小型会议漫谈，如某村百多亩黑地即在“跑反”时随便和群众漫谈中查出。
