Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 3rd. The masses in the newly recovered areas along the Shenyang-Jilin railway are throwing themselves into the summer plowing and planting campaign with great enthusiasm. A vibrant scene of plowing can be heard from Shuiliandong in the west to Qianshantou, sixty *li* to the east. In Xichangxing village, all forty-odd peasant households have voluntarily formed more than ten teams to plow the land, working from dawn till dusk. They comfort each other, saying, "Now that the Democratic Allied Army is here, we will have good days again!" After the Democratic Government promptly distributed seeds and two months' worth of food to the masses in Donggang village, their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented levels. They prepared all thirty-odd livestock and finished planting all the land of the villagers participating in the effort in a single day. Many young peasants expressed their intention to join the Democratic Allied Army to seek revenge after finishing planting their land.
Xinhua News Agency, Rehe and Chahar-Jehol Border Region, 1st. In Dayingzi village, Linxi, Zhaowuda League, northern Rehe, 116 Mongol and Han peasant households have all been organized for mutual aid in production. Each person in the village has an average of five *mu* of paddy field. They are now freely forming mutual aid teams of three to five people. Village cadres take turns on duty, and everyone participates in production, leading the lazy people to form mutual aid teams. Each team has a work recorder who assesses and records work points based on work efficiency, regardless of age or gender. Settlements are made every five days, and the planting is now complete. They have also collectively repaired two canals.

    群众热烈闹生产
    【新华社辽东三日电】沈（阳）吉（林）线新收复区群众，以高度生产热情，卷入夏耕抢种运动。西至水帘洞，东至黔山头六十里的广大地面，洋溢着驱犁声。西常兴屯全村四十余户农民，自愿组成十余插犋小组，披星戴月，紧张耕种。并互相安慰说：“民主联军来了，我们又有好日子过了！”东岗屯群众经民主政府及时发给种子及两个月的粮食后，生产情绪空前增高，将三十几头牲畜收拾好，一天中即把全村参战民夫的地全部种完。不少青年农民表示：在种完地后，要参加民主联军复仇。
    【新华社冀察热辽一日电】热河北部昭乌达盟林西大营子村，蒙汉农民一百一十六户已全部组织起来，变工生产。该村每人平均分有五亩水地，现正三五人自由结成一变工组，村干轮流值日，全体参加生产，带领懒汉组成变工组。每组有一记工员，不问男女老弱，按工作效率评工记工。五天一结算，现已种完。并又集体修渠两道。
