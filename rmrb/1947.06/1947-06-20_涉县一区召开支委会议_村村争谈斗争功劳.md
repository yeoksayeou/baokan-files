The Shexian First District Holds Branch Committee Meeting
　　Villages Compete to Talk About Struggle Achievements
　　[Report from Shexian by Our Newspaper] To welcome the "July 1st" Party anniversary and launch a widespread campaign to earn merit, the First District held a district-wide branch committee meeting on May 31 to summarize the struggle history of the branches, select models, and set out future merit-making plans. The situation of the conference is reported as follows: Recognizing Our Own Achievements Through Summarizing the Struggle History of the Branches in Discussions. Initially, some comrades were unwilling to talk, thinking that once the past was done, there was no need to talk about it. At this time, the leadership pointed out: If past achievements are not mentioned, others will not know; if work is not summarized, one will not progress, cannot improve work, and cannot make more contributions to the people. At the same time, a typical example was given first as a demonstration and enlightenment. Everyone found a way, saying, "If we talk like this, our branch also has many achievements." Thus, each village competed to talk about its own achievements, and summarizing work and talking about merits became a movement. Every Party member carefully considered what their village did in which year, who led the struggle in which year. For example, Sige Village summarized eight major achievements, the main ones being: 1. Developed the Peasants' Association and militia, using this force as the main force to overthrow the old regime and replace the bad cadres who ate and drank extravagantly. 2. Anti-corruption, fair and reasonable burden struggle, recovered 700 mu of burden land from Licheng. 3. Mobilized the masses to carry out a shocking rent reduction and debt clearing campaign. Rent reduction in Dongyangguan alone returned more than 80 shi of lost grain and restored 288 mu of tenant rights land. During rent reduction, tenants could not reason and feared the landlords. Cadres taught them to remember the phrase "Guarantee Tenant Rights," and they would not retreat without returning the grain. At least two dou per mu had to be returned. They patiently taught the tenants and had them memorize it before finally succeeding. 4. Mobilized the masses to produce and save, overcoming the terrible famine year. No one starved to death in the whole village. At the same time, a locust eradication campaign was carried out like fighting the enemy. 5. Expanded the army seven times, with 47 young people joining the Party army, including four Party members taking the lead. 6. Organized the militia to persist in the war and cover the retreat of the masses. 7. Carried out a thorough land reform, returning land to the farmers, eliminating landlords, and eliminating extreme poverty. 8. In the past, only one or two women in the village could spin and weave. Over the past nine years, under the active promotion and organization of cadres, there are now 228 spinners, more than 40 weavers, and 38 looms. A cooperative was established in the whole village. After summarizing their merits and achievements, each branch excited every Party member, who said, "Once you think about it, it's amazing." Everyone's enthusiasm was very high. On this basis, a democratic comparison and evaluation of merits was carried out. Every Party member made unbiased spiritual evaluations of themselves and other villages, showing the spirit of Communist Party members pursuing the truth. For example, when evaluating the Yangjiashan branch, Party member ××× proposed: "Their struggle history is longer than any other village, and they have cultivated labor heroes who participated in the border region. In my opinion, they should be in the top rank." Another Party member said: "I don't agree with this opinion. Although they have done a lot, the branch has been disunited in the last two years, and the work has suffered losses. They should be in the second rank." Later, the vast majority of opinions converged. At this time, they said: "The principle of the minority submitting to the majority is the Party's principle, and we agree." As a result of the evaluation, four model branches such as Sige Township were selected, seven second-class branches, eight third-class branches, and five fourth-class branches. Fifteen first-class model figures and others were also divided into different grades. After the evaluation, everyone had no objections. The Tangpu branch said: "We are not pessimistic about being a fourth-class village this time. In fact, we are not as good as other villages. However, we will work hard this time and talk about it again on 'July 1'."
  
　　Mourn the Martyrs, Inherit Their Legacy, Resolutely Strive for More Merit
　　From summarizing achievements and evaluating merits, the merits of the deceased Party members were also discussed. Everyone had the demand to mourn them. Each base point automatically made wreaths with cypress branches and white paper. Every Party member wore white flowers and held an unprecedentedly grand memorial service. At the meeting, the memorial text and the glorious deeds of the deceased comrades were read out, and every Party member was greatly moved. An atmosphere of class love and class hatred appeared in the venue. The whole place was quiet, and everyone was so sad that they couldn't speak. Comrade Wang cried bitterly in his seat and said: "These comrades gloriously sacrificed while fighting the landlords. We who are alive must complete their legacy and fight Chiang Kai-shek and the landlords in our village to the end until we defeat them..." Then, they all swore an oath in front of the martyrs' spiritual tablets, expressing their determination to complete the unfinished cause of the martyrs, resolutely complete all the tasks given by the Party, and resolutely make contributions to the people. It was also proposed to build a monument for the 26 deceased Party members in the district as a permanent memorial.
　　After the memorial service, each village and each person made their own plans for making contributions to the people before "July 1". Each branch and each Party member was vying to speak. At the same time, each village and each person found the key points, based on the spirit of learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses, making the good even better and the bad catching up, and those with similar shortcomings making progress together, setting off a wave of mutual competition for making contributions to the people and progressive revolutionary competition. For example, Comrade Yang said: "I have always been subjective and undemocratic in my style. I have a small stubborn temper. If things don't go my way, it won't work. This problem must be overcome before 'July 1'. I want to learn from Shen Rui and use his strengths to make up for my weaknesses, and resolutely catch up with him." Comrade Shi said: "Although my position is good, my style is not good. I must overcome it before 'July 1'. Let's see who overcomes it faster." The Linghou branch said: "We will resolutely go back and do a good job in drought prevention and famine preparation, and challenge Sige Township. Whoever loses will fly a flag." In this way, everyone made plans to make contributions, and their enthusiasm was a hundred times higher. It was also decided to check each other and summarize on "July 1." (Chong Zhi)

　　涉县一区召开支委会议
    村村争谈斗争功劳
    【本报涉县讯】为迎接“七一”党的生日，展开普遍的立功运动，一区于五月三十一日召开全区支委会议，总结支部斗争历史，评选模范，订出今后的立功计划。兹将大会情形报导于后：从座谈总结支部斗争历史中认识了自己的功劳。开始有些同志不愿意谈，他们的思想是做过去就算了，谈它干啥。这时领导上提出：过去的成绩不说别人不知道，不总结工作自己不会进步，不能提高工作，不能再更多的为民立功。同时又先由典型谈了一下，做了个示范启发，大家找到了门路，都说：“如果这样说起来吧，俺的支部也有很多成绩。”这样各村都争说着自己村的成绩，总结工作谈功劳形成了一个运动，每个党员都细心的考虑自己村那一年干啥，那一年斗争谁是那一个同志领导的，如四合乡村，总结出八件大功劳，主要的一、发展了农会、民兵，以这个力量为主，推倒了旧政权，改换了大吃二喝的坏干部。二、反贪污，公平合理的负担斗争，从黎城搞回负担地亩七百亩。三、发动群众进行了惊天动地的减租清债，光从东阳关减租，退回损失粮八十多石，恢复佃权地二百八十八亩，减租时佃户说不了理，害地主怕，干部死教他们记住“保障佃权”一句话，还有不退不行，每亩最少退二斗，这样苦口婆心教会佃户，而且背下来最后才胜利了。四、发动群众生产节约渡过了可怕的灾荒年，全村没有饿死人，同时进行了和打敌人一样的消灭蝗虫运动。五、共扩军七次，四十七个青壮年参加了党军，内有四个党员带头。六、组织民兵坚持了战争，掩护群众退却。七、进行了彻底的土地改革，农民土地回了家，消灭了地主，消灭了赤贫。八、从前全村只有一二个妇女会纺织，九年来在干部积极推动组织下，现在纺妇二百二十八个，织妇四十余人，有机三十八架，全村建立了一个合作社。各支部经过总结功劳成绩，兴奋了每个党员，都说：“一回想就是了不得呀。”大家的情绪十分高涨，在这个基础上，又进行了民主的比功劳评功，每个党员对自己对其他村都是不折不扣的精神评议着，都表现了共产党员追求真理的精神，如评议杨家山支部时，党员×××提出：“人家的斗争历史比任何村都长，并培养了参加边区的劳动英雄，我的意见人家占到个头等条件。”另一个党员说：“我不赞成这个意见，虽说他做的事不少，但后来这二年支部就不团结了，工作受了损失，应该到二等。”后来绝大部分意见趋于一致，这时他们说：“少数服从多数是党的原则，我们也同意了。评选的结果，全区选出四合乡等四个模范支部，二等支部七个，三等的八个，四等的五个，模范人物头等的十五人，其他也依次分等评出。评功后大家啥意见也没有，向堂铺支部说：“这次到了四等村并不悲观，实际上咱就不如别村好，不过这次下去要努力，到‘七一’来了再说吧。”
  追悼先烈继承遗志  坚决争取功上加功
    从总结成绩评功劳中同时也谈出了死难党员的功劳，大家有了追悼他们的要求，各基点都自动的用柏枝和白纸做着花圈，每个党员都带着白花，举行了空前隆重的追悼。会上宣读了祭文和死难同志的光荣事绩，每个党员大受感动，会场现出了阶级友爱和阶级仇恨空气，全场静静的，都难过的说不出话来。汪同志在自己坐位上痛哭着说：“这些同志是和地主斗争而光荣牺牲的，我们活着的人要完成他们的遗志，和蒋介石及本村地主斗争到底，直到打垮为止………。”遂即都对着烈士的灵位宣了誓，表示坚决完成他们未完成的事业，坚决完成党给的一切任务，坚决为民立功。并提议给全区二十六位死难党员建碑以作永久纪念。
    追悼后各村各人订自己的“七一”以前为民立功计划，每个支部每个党员都是争抢着说，同时每村每人都找着了重点，本着取长补短，好的更好坏的赶上、有同类缺点者是齐头比进步的精神，掀起了为民立功互相比赛的热潮及进步的革命竞赛。如杨同志说：“我一贯主观，作风不民主，有个小蹩扭脾气，啥事不顺我的意了就不行，这个毛病在‘七一’以前一定克服，我要向申瑞学习，拿他的长补我的短，并坚决赶上他。”石同志说：“我虽说立场好，可是作风不好，‘七一’以前要克服，咱看谁克服的快。”岭后支部说：“坚决回去做好防旱备荒工作，给四合乡挑战，谁输了一杆旗。”这样大家都订了立功计划，情绪是百倍的高涨，并决定要互相检查，到“七一”总结。（崇智）
