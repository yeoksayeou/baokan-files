Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 12th. The people of Shandong are solving the food supply and transportation problems for hundreds of thousands of field army troops with amazing effort. Tens of thousands of carrying poles, livestock, small carts, and large carts, some traveling thousands of miles, some climbing over mountains and ridges with arduous steps. Through the hard work and high enthusiasm of the broad masses in supporting the front lines, the contradiction between the limitations of geographical conditions and backward transportation tools and the modern, large-scale mobile warfare has been basically overcome. The Beihai Detachment, with its huge transportation capacity, can transport hundreds of thousands of catties of grain each time. The vehicle load has been increased from 800-900 catties to 1,200 catties, and the round trip has been shortened from five days to four days. The small carts of the Zhucheng Detachment usually carry 150 catties, but now they generally carry more than 200 catties. The speed of night driving has also increased from 40 li to 60 li. Most of the transport teams carry raincoats and mats to protect the grain from rain, and they are equipped with carpenters to repair the carts at any time. When there are not enough cloth bags, the civilians use their own bed sheets and quilts to hold the grain. During the Battle of Menglianggu, many transport teams accompanying the army braved the threat of enemy aircraft strafing and rushed day and night to deliver grain. The Xicheng Detachment and the Jiaonan Brigade went to the front's mountains and ridges, where small carts could not go up, so each person carried bags of grain up the mountain. They smiled and went back only when they saw their troops using the grain they had transported instead of sweet potato peels in the pot. A civilian of the Environmental Protection Brigade said, "The grain is not delivered until it is delivered to the soldiers' mouths." When the Liberation Army soldiers were eating their fill and fighting bravely, it was precisely when the enemy in Menglianggu was so hungry that their limbs were weak and they were about to be wiped out.

　　山东人民大力支援前线
    数十万野战军供应充足
    【新华社山东十二日电】山东人民以惊人努力解决数十万野战大军粮食供应运输问题。成千成万的挑子、牲口、小车、大车，有的长途跋涉千里之遥，有的翻山越岭步步艰辛。通过此广大群众艰苦耐劳与支援前线的高度热情，基本上克服了地理条件限制及落后交通工具与近代化的大规模运动战之间的矛盾。具有庞大运输力的北海支队，每次能起运数十万斤粮食。将车载重由八九百斤增至一千二百斤，来回运送一趟亦由五天缩减至四天。诸城支队小车平时载重一百五十斤，现在普遍装二百多斤。晚上行车速度亦自四十里增至六十里。大部运输队带有蓑衣、席子，以便遇雨保护粮食，并配备木匠，随时修车。布袋不够用时，民夫们就以自己被单、褥子装粮。孟良崮之战中，许多随军运输队冒敌机扫射威胁，日夜兼程送粮。西城支队及胶南大队到前方丛山峻岭，小车无法上去，每人把一袋袋粮食扛上山。他们看到自己部队把运去的粮食代替地瓜皮放进锅里，才笑嘻嘻的回去。环保大队民夫说：“粮食要送到战士们嘴下才算送到。”当解放军战士吃得饱饱的勇猛作战之时，正好是孟良崮敌人饿得四肢乏力行将就歼之际。
