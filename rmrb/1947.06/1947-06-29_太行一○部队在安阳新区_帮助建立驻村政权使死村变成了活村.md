　　The Taihang 10th Unit in the Anyang New District
    Helping to Establish Village Governments Transforms Dead Villages into Living Villages
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Comrade Liu Zhi of the Yubei Front reports: The Taihang 10th Unit entered the Anyang New District for combat, and the Chiang Kai-shek's baojia heads had fled, causing disorder. Therefore, the Political Department decided that each unit should assist in organizing village governments and organize work teams to conduct inspections. In the past twenty days, the following achievements have been made: (1) Combining propaganda and organizational work: Landlords fled, and most of those conscripted were from the basic masses. Due to the lack of organization, the burden was uneven. There was a demand for organization. Therefore, after speaking of grievances and individual conversations, they quickly established their own village governments. Some were connected through relatives, and some were through activities of military dependents. In a certain village, Zhang Cai'er, a groom, Zhang Chengzhang, a cook, Cheng Tian'en, and soldier Meng Chunxi of the 108th Unit, took the initiative to find dozens of people, gathered together to publicize our army's propositions, and also established a village office. There was a village chief, deputy village chief, finance and grain personnel, and clerks, and they hung up the sign of the Democratic Village Office. The village deputy was a cadre of the troops. The division of labor included a transportation team (carts), a conscription team, and a service team. (2) Achievements: Nine village governments and three district governments have been organized, and 320 people, including 60 women, have been organized. The troops respect the government, and unified borrowing and buying of things have made things convenient for both the army and the people. They also took out the grain of fleeing landlords to relieve disaster victims. In Qijiazhuang, 2 shi and 4 dou of grain (large shi) were distributed. The masses were mobilized to speak of the suffering under Chiang's army and Chiang's regime, and the propositions of our Party were publicized. On the spot, the masses reported handing over five guns, greatly inspiring the masses' enthusiasm to assist our army in combat. Not only did they provide conscripted labor, but some also automatically braved enemy gunfire to deliver water and food to the trenches, and organized women to sew and wash clothes. A total of nine rifles, one oboe, two quick target rifles, and more than 300 rounds of ammunition were reported from reactionary landlords and special agents. The masses quickly reflected any difficulties to the troops. For example, if there were few local vegetables, the troops tried to buy them elsewhere. They mobilized hidden and fleeing masses to return home for production. In a certain village, initially 40 to 50 people left, but in the end only one person did not return. They organized vendors to prosper the countryside. For example, when they first arrived, there was no one selling things, but in the end there were many selling fried dough sticks, vegetables, and groceries, turning a dead village into a living village. (3) Several good village deputies have emerged, such as Bao Zhonghua, who supported the masses and made decisions for them, taking both the military and the people into consideration. The masses said he was a "good official." Cui Qinlu: The masses said that with Comrade Cui around, everything was easy to handle. Li Yuying: She was unpretentious and helped the masses chop grass. The masses said: "Old Li should stay, don't leave." Fan Shuicheng held mass grievance meetings to raise class consciousness. Yang Zhaowen: His work was the best. If the masses had any difficulties, they always ran to find Old Yang.

　　太行一○部队在安阳新区
    帮助建立驻村政权使死村变成了活村
    【本报讯】豫北前线刘志同志报导：太行一○部队进入安阳新区作战，蒋记保甲长已逃，秩序紊乱。因此，政治部决定各部帮助组织驻村政权，并组织工作组进行检查。二十天来，已获如下成绩：（一）宣传与组织工作结合：地主逃去，支差多是基本群众，因缺乏组织，负担轻重不一，有组织起来要求，所以，经诉苦及个别谈话后，很快成立起自己的村政权来。有的经亲戚串通，军属活动。某村是一○八部马夫张彩儿、张成章、伙夫程天恩、战士孟春喜自动找几十个群众，集合宣传我军主张后，也成立起村公所来。有村长、副村长、财粮、文书，挂上民主村公所的牌子，村副是部队干部担任。分工有运输组（大车）、支差组、勤务组。（二）有了成绩：组织起九个村政权，三个区政权，组织群众有三百二十人，六十个妇女。部队尊重政权，统一借、买东西，军民都感方便，并拿出逃亡地主粮食救济灾难民。七家庄发放了二石四斗谷子（大石），发动群众诉蒋军蒋政权的苦，宣传我党主张，当场群众报告拿出五支枪，大大启发群众协助我军作战的积极性。不但支差，有的自动冒敌枪火往战壕里送水送饭，组织妇女缝洗衣服。共告发反动地主、特务步枪九支、八音一支、快靶子二支、子弹三百余发。群众有啥困难，很快反映到部队。如当地菜少，部队设法往别处买。发动隐藏及逃亡群众归家生产，某村开始外出四五十人，最后只一人未回。组织小贩繁荣农村，如去时没一个卖东西的，最后卖油条、菜、杂货的很多，死村变成活村了。（三）涌现出几个好村副，如鲍中华给群众撑腰作主，军民兼顾，群众说是“好官”。崔勤禄：群众说崔同志在，啥事也好办。李玉英：没架子，帮助群众铡草。群众说：“老李当下去，不要走了。”范水成，召开群众诉苦座谈会，提高阶级觉悟。杨兆文：工作最好，群众有点啥困难，总跑来找老杨。
