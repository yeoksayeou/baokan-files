　　Ignite the Flames of Revenge
    Qixian County's Experience in Training Active Elements

    (1) How to mobilize trainees?

    Under the long-term rule, deception, oppression, and exploitation by the enemy, puppets, traitors, and local bullies, mobilizing trainees is an arduous task. First, the requirements for trainees should be that the vast majority are poor peasants, extremely poor peasants, hired laborers, urban poor, and small merchants. A small number of middle peasants can also be absorbed. There should not be excessively high requirements. For example, someone in the First District proposed that they must be young people with no political problems and who have suffered greatly. In fact, in the newly liberated areas, all impoverished peasants have suffered. As for age, that is a matter to be addressed after entering the training class. Young people's suffering is not necessarily greater than that of the elderly. It is also impossible to understand whether there are political problems at the beginning. However, all Bao (neighborhood) and Jia (group) chiefs, Bao Ding (local militia), puppet soldiers, militia groups, and landlords must be purged. These people pose a great threat to the masses and are mostly consciously infiltrating. Although some in the puppet army and militia groups have also suffered, they have all extorted from the masses to some extent over the years. It is impossible to change the masses' negative impressions of them in a short period. The thoughts of these people cannot be transformed by a short-term training class.

    Secondly, in absorbing trainees, both men and women must be included. In the newly liberated areas, we should adopt the policy of mobilizing the majority and uniting 90% of the masses from the outset. We must overcome the notion held by some cadres that men are easier to mobilize, women are backward, men suffer greatly, and women suffer little. In the newly liberated areas, according to our understanding, many women have suffered greatly due to the enemy and puppets forcibly conscripting laborers and creating years of famine. Facts have proven that in the training class of the First District, women's complaints greatly promoted others.

    Thirdly, break with egalitarianism and adopt a focus-oriented approach. Because when there are many people, it is easy to see one's own strength. Everyone works together, unafraid of getting wet feet by crossing the river first. At the same time, it is easy to find the root cause of poverty and express one's grievances. For example, 60 people were mobilized for intensive training in Beiguan Village, which not only found the root cause of each individual's poverty but also the root cause of each village's poverty. Who is the backstage supporter and who is the tool? Under mutual inspiration, combat readiness was enhanced, and the demands quickly formed a leading core.

    Finally, in terms of mobilization methods and approaches, cadres must take action themselves and adopt a mass line, allowing the masses to connect with each other, one connection leading to a large number; avoid going through Bao and Jia chiefs, as that will lead to failure. To reduce the masses' concerns, it is best to use the name of holding a meeting.

    During the mobilization process, we must closely combine it with anti-rumor and anti-sabotage efforts. At the same time, we must explain the purpose of the training to the trainees and dispel various concerns before training. Because, according to our understanding, in addition to some who voluntarily participate in the training, most people harbor various concerns. Among them, the fear of a change in the political situation is widespread. Some are embarrassed not to come, thinking that others have helped them, given them relief grain, and think highly of them, so why not show appreciation. Therefore, they dare not not come, fearing problems if they don't come. Others come for the relief grain. The government provides food, so they will eat for a few days regardless. Some fear it will delay production, while others are sent by Bao and Jia chiefs, with extremely complex thoughts and uneasy emotions.

    In the First District, it was clearly stated that the purpose of the training was to help everyone achieve liberation, to have land for those without land, houses for those without houses, clothes for those without clothes, food for those without food, and capital for those without money to do business. Afterward, the trainees reflected, saying: "They are doing this for us to have a good life, so what are we afraid of? See how they are thinking of us poor people in every way. When has the Kuomintang army ever done this?"

    (2) Training process and methods.

    First, talk about current affairs. 1. Recognize the difference between the Eighth Route Army and the Kuomintang army, so that the trainees' thoughts and emotions are consistent with ours. Focus on arousing hatred for the enemy and the stubborn elements. When mentioning the Kuomintang army, the masses hate the most the stealing of things, the conscription of husbands, and the conscription of laborers. Once the issue is raised, it immediately turns into a mass accusation against the puppet and stubborn elements. Initially, the masses speak of us mostly from the perspective of our lifestyle, such as speaking kindly, having a good temper, not beating or scolding people, and buying and selling fairly. But we cannot be satisfied with this. We must raise it to the level that the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government are serving the people. 2. When comparing strengths, we must start from what the masses have personally seen and heard. For example, when discussing whether Hu Quanlu in the Sixth District was terrible or not, the masses said that Lao Hu relied on Sun Dianying, but was captured alive by the Eighth Route Army, and relied on generations of soldiers, but was wiped out. The blockhouses built over several years were opened by the Eighth Route Army in half a day; the weapons were not few, but they were seized by the Eighth Route Army. In short, start with issues that are most easily accepted by the masses, and then extend to the national situation and the development of the Eighth Route Army. Avoid irrelevant empty talk about the international and domestic war situation. Then, turn to accusing landlords and bullies, using the comparison of rich and poor lives to lead to the source of suffering. Where does poverty come from? Whose land is it, and who relies on whom to live? These issues enlighten their consciousness. This is a turning point in their thinking. But at the beginning, talk about things but not people, talk about generalities but not specifics, talk about others but not themselves. The accusations cannot go deep because of a lack of examples, full of bitterness but afraid to speak out, with many concerns and fears of leaking secrets.

    After understanding the concerns, conduct individual visits to inquire about suffering, telling them that they are all poor friends and can tell people who know the truth. Once a breakthrough is made, they can cry out in the meeting. Yan Qingshan, a 69-year-old from Dongguan in the First District, accused an evil bully of seizing 18 mu of land. He filed a lawsuit and his whole family was detained, with each person receiving 200 military strokes. His accusation mobilized the class emotions of the entire group and aroused the masses' hatred. But finding the root cause of poverty is not the masses' goal. We must dig out the root cause of poverty. At this time, the leadership puts forward how to do it. When discussing Qingshan's problem, the 18 mu of land were returned, and 30 years of blood debts were to be settled. The old man was so moved that he almost shed tears, which further stimulated more people to accuse, and the movement moved towards balance. When the masses demand action, there is naturally a demand to organize. Then, propose to form a group and establish a peasant association; the Second District proposed that peasants handle peasant affairs. The leadership will seize the opportunity and the movement will develop straight up.

    (3) Everything is for running the training class well.

    1. The administrative负责人 (responsible person) should speak more, which is one of the ways to show support and make decisions for the masses.

    2. Care about the trainees' lives. Every night, the leaders tell them to cover their quilts and not catch a cold or get sick. They are very moved and say that no one has cared about them like this in ten years. Through close proximity in life, establish the feelings of a family, get close to us, and dare to talk to us about everything in their hearts.

    3. Sing liberation songs. In the First District, when singing about fleeing from famine and selling children, everyone could not continue singing because it was their own experience and they only wanted to cry. The Sixth District used Hu Quanlu's extortion facts to compose songs. In the Fifth District, whoever made a good accusation would immediately compose a tune, which greatly promoted the movement.

    4. The issue of combining the training class with work in the village. In Beiguan, during the visits to inquire about suffering, it was discovered that people were afraid to accuse. After in-depth understanding, it was learned that they were afraid of being shot in the back. Immediately, Beiguan was notified to arrest four black gunmen. That night, accusations were widely launched, and emotions were unprecedentedly high.

    淇县训练积极层经验
    （一）如何动员学员？
    在敌伪奸霸长期统治欺骗压榨下，动员学员是一件艰难的任务。首先对学员的要求上，绝大多数应该是贫农、赤贫、雇工、城市贫民、小商人等。中农也可吸收一少部分。不该有过高的要求。如一区有人提出必须是青年人，苦大无政治问题的。其实在新区凡穷苦的农民都有苦。至于年岁大小，那是到训练班以后工作问题。青年人的苦不一定比老年人多。有无政治问题，开始也不能了解。不过凡是保、甲长、保丁、伪军、会队、地主一律清洗，这些人对群众威胁大，多半是有意识打进来的。虽然有些在伪军、会队中也有苦，但几年来多少对群众都有讹诈事实，短期间不可能转变群众对他们的恶劣印象，这些人的思想，也不是短期训练班所能转变。
    其次在吸收学员上，须男女兼收，在新区一着手即应采取发动多数，团结百分之九十群众的方针，必须克服有些干部认为男人好发动，妇女落后，男人苦大，妇女苦小的观念。在新区，据我们了解，许多妇女经过敌伪强抓壮丁和敌伪制造数年灾荒情况下，痛苦很大。事实证明，一区训练班中，妇女诉苦对其他人推动很大。
    再次打破平均主义，采取重点主义。因为人多容易看到自己力量，大家一齐干，不怕先过河先湿脚，同时也容易找出穷根，诉出对象。如北关一村即调六十人集训，不仅找到各人穷根，而且找到各村穷根。谁是后台谁是工具，在相互启发下，增强斗志，要求力即行动，很快的形成领导核心。
    最后在动员方法方式上，必须干部亲自动手，采取群众路线，让群众自己串通，一串一大层；切忌通过保、甲长，那是失败的。为了减除群众顾虑，最好用开会名义。
    动员过程中，必须紧紧结合反谣言反破坏；同时对学员要说明训练目的，打破受训前各种顾虑。因为，根据我们了解，除了部分自愿参加受训外，大多数人都怀着各种顾虑。其中怕变天的思想是普遍的，有的不好意思不来，认为人家救济了自己，给了救济粮，人家看得起自己，为啥不识抬举。以是不敢不来，不来怕出问题。还有的是为了吃救济粮来的。公家管饭，不管如何吃几天再说。有的怕耽误生产，还有是保、甲长派来的，思想极端复杂，情绪不安。
    在一区明确提出训练目的为了帮助大家翻身，没地有地种，没房子有房屋住，没衣的有衣穿，没饭的有饭吃，没钱的作买卖的有资本。事后学员们反映说：人家为了咱们过好光景，咱怕啥，看人家处处为咱们穷人们打算，中央军啥时有这样。
    （二）训练过程和方法。
    先讲时事。一、认识八路军和蒋军的区别，使学员思想上情绪上和我们一致起来。重激起对敌顽的仇恨，一提起蒋军，群众最仇恨的是抢东西、抓夫、抓丁，问题一提出，立即变成群众性的对伪顽的控诉。对我们一开始多是从生活态度上说起，如说话和气脾气好，不打人不骂人，公买公卖。但不能满足于这一点，必须提到共产党八路军和民主政府是为人民服务上去。二、比力量要从群众亲身见到的听到的说起。如六区讨论扈全禄可怕不可怕，群众说老扈上靠孙殿英，被八路军活捉住了，下靠辈辈兵，被歼灭了。几年建筑的碉堡，被八路军半天打开了；武器不算少，可是被八路军缴获了。总之从群众最易接受的问题谈起，再推广到全国形势和八路军发展情况。切忌不着边际的空谈国际国内战局。接着转向对地主奸霸诉苦，从贫富生活对比上引苦，穷从那里来？土地是谁的，谁靠谁活等问题上，启发他们觉悟。这是思想上一个转折。但开始谈事不谈人，说一般不说具体，说他人不说自己。诉苦不能深入下去，问题在缺乏典型，满肚苦楚和诉不敢诉，顾虑多怕泄露。
    了解顾虑后作个别访苦，告以都是穷朋友，有话诉给知人，突破一点便在大会哭诉起来。一区东关六十九岁的阎青山，诉出十八亩地被恶霸夺去，告了一状全家被扣，每人二百军棍，他一诉苦，调动全体阶级情感，激起群众仇恨。但找穷根不是群众目的，必须挖掉穷根，这时领导上提出如何办。讨论青山问题时，十八亩地退回，还要清算三十年血账，把老汉感动的几乎流下眼泪，更激发了更多人的诉苦，运动走向了平衡。群众要求行动时，很自然有组织起来的要求。便提出结团体，成立农会；二区提出农民的事农民办。领导上抓紧运动便会直上发展。
    （三）一切为了办好训练班。
    一、行政负责人多讲话，这是表示对群众撑腰作主办法之一。
    二、关心学员生活，每晚领导人招呼他们盖被子别着凉生病，他们很感动的说是十年没人这样关心过。通过生活上的接近，建立一家人的情感，接近我们，一切内心话敢于和我们谈。
    三、唱翻身歌，一区唱到灾荒年逃荒买了孩子时，都唱不下去，心里只想哭，因这是他们自己的事。六区拿扈全禄讹诈事实编成歌子。五区则是谁诉的好，便立即编成调子，对运动推动都很大。
    四、训练班与在村工作结合的问题。北关在访苦中发现不敢诉，深入了解后，知道怕打黑枪，立即通知北关逮捕了四个黑枪手，当晚普遍的展开诉苦，情绪空前高涨起来。
