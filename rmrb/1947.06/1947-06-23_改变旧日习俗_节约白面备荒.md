　　Change Old Customs
    Save White Flour to Prepare for Famine
    [Report from Lin County by this newspaper] When farmers in Yuankang Village, Third District, discussed the call from the Taihang District Party Committee, the leadership first exposed the erroneous idea of indulging in feasting after the wheat harvest. They explained that the severity of this year's drought was different from previous years and that turning over (to communism) was still just an empty shell. They had people calculate their families' grain reserves and asked what would happen if the autumn harvest was poor again. They inspired everyone to discuss several questions: "Why is the higher level making this call? Who benefits from it? Think about the suffering during the famine years; what should we do now?" Wu Jianyuan said, "The weather is so dry now, the call from above is directed at us. If each of us saves one *he* of rice per day, we won't starve to death during the famine years. It's terrifying to think about the waste these past few days." A woman named Yang Meishun said, "What we save is ours, no one else will take it. It's frightening to think about the white clay and bran we ate during the famine! The call from above will never harm us." Shi Lucheng said, "It was so pitiful what we ate during the famine, every time we defecated, we shed tears. Now, even if we reduce our meals by half, we won't get thin." The entire audience, men, women, old, and young, made a great clamor, greatly increasing their attention to the current disaster situation. They felt great regret for their past waste, and unanimously proposed the slogan: "Rather let the stream trickle, than the ashes smolder." They formulated a six-point plan for the present: 1. Exchange wheat for rice or corn. 2. Change the old habit of wasting during visits to relatives. 3. Gather wild vegetables and tree shoots. 4. Each person saves three *liang* of rice per day. 5. Quickly help each other, with men carrying loads and women spinning during free time. 6. Hurry to plant millet and corn. Now, the whole village has started a great wave of production and frugality. Li Lin's group of four planted one *mu* of corn in one day. (Yunhua, Binghe)
    [Report from Wu Xiang by this newspaper] Hanbi Village, Second District, has set a plan for each person to save one *he* of millet per day (eat four *liang* more vegetables). Li Zihong's group proposed to guarantee that no food would be left over every day. Wang Baofa, Zhang Songzhen, and others pointed out that they used to smoke too much, with each person smoking three pieces of iron plate tobacco per day. In the future, they will only smoke one piece, and will smoke less or no paper cigarettes. (Jingfu, Mingtu)
