Launching the Struggle Against Drought
    Well Digging in Southern Hebei

[Report from our office in Southern Hebei, 10th] To resolutely fight the drought, liberated farmers in Southern Hebei are digging and cleaning wells. Wanghuazhuang in the seventh district of Gaotang is a small village of 41 households with a large population and little land. After liberation, the masses organized five mutual aid teams, which helped dig five earthen wells. Those not in the organizations dug three wells. They also uncovered two long-buried brick wells. They are now planning to dig four brick wells. After Chen Gu Yan Xinguang of the second district of Guangping made a household plan, he dug a brick well in three days. The water is sweet and good, and cotton has been planted. He happily said, "Even if it doesn't rain in the future, I won't be afraid." The Wu Deyun mutual aid team in Jiudian, the first district of Feixiang, dug an earthen well in a convenient location in the fields of several households during the rush planting, and can produce 200 dan of water every day. Xiao Zhuo and Gao Lao Zhen and three other households in Hanzhangzhuang, the first district of Jiangping, are neighbors. There is a large well on their land that has been silted up with mud. After discussion, the five families pooled 5,000 yuan, spent 30 catties of lime, 300 bricks, and started to repair it. The water pit in Shuikeng, where the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office is stationed, is completely dry, and the two alkaline wells cannot be used for irrigation. One sweet water well is not enough for the villagers to drink. The office immediately helped the masses to clean a well that had not been cleaned for more than 30 years, and the next day they dug two earthen wells at the bottom of the pit. The masses have already started a heatwave of planting and saving seedlings.

    【本报冀南十日电】坚决与灾旱进行斗争，冀南翻身农民进行打井、掏井。高唐七区王化庄是一个四十一户的小村，人多地少，翻身后群众组织了五个互助组，互助掘土井五个，不在组织的群众掘了三个，把多年埋没的两眼砖井也掘出来，现正在计划掘四个砖井。广平二区陈固阎心光订了按家计划后，三天工夫打了一眼砖井，水又甜又好，把棉花都种上了，他高兴的说：“以后天不下雨，我也不怕。”肥乡一区旧店吴德运互助组，于突击点种中，在几户地的适中处，伙挖了一眼土井，每天能出二百担水。降平一区韩张庄小着、高老珍等五户是地邻，地中有一眼为泥土淤浅的大井，经商议五家集款五千元，费了三十斤石灰，三百砖，动工重修。五专署驻村水坑全干，两眼碱井不能浇地，一眼甜水井还不够村人吃用，机关即帮助群众掏三十多年没掏过的井，次日又于坑底挖了两个土井，群众已掀起点种救苗热潮。
