　　Make Persistent Efforts to Overcome Waiting Mentality
    Shahe Fourth District Implements Drought Preparedness
    [Report from this newspaper, Shahe] District cadres from the Fourth District convened a meeting to summarize the drought resistance and preparedness campaign and make future plans. The district has 45 villages of varying sizes, 12 of which are entirely dry land, making it impossible to dig wells for irrigation. The remaining 33 villages each have a small portion of irrigated land, but the vast majority is dry land. In the past, the masses relied entirely on rainfall. This year, during the mobilization for drought resistance and preparedness, the entire district carried water to plant over 4,000 mu of cotton. All the irrigated land has been sown. Seedlings in the 70-plus mu of irrigated land in Beizhang Village have been hoed once, and corn is beginning its second hoeing, with a second watering ongoing. In the Zanshan Joint Defense area's three villages, the cotton seedlings watered for planting have also generally received one watering, with some households having watered three times. In Baicuo, Xinzhang, Xincheng, and other villages, in addition to planting millet in the irrigated land, they are also organizing the planting of corn in dry land. There has also been progress in drought preparedness: the Xinzhang Cooperative is buying chaff to prepare for the lean season, every household in Hetou Village is gathering elm leaves, and groups of children, both boys and girls, from Xincheng Village are gathering wild vegetables everywhere. A young girl from Xiliuquan Village gathered two pockets of small persimmons in a single day. However, based on the overall situation in the district, drought resistance and preparedness have not yet developed into a large-scale movement. Many people are still waiting for rain, and some cadres have not effectively organized and led the masses in the fight against drought. After discussion, everyone clearly recognized the role of cadres leading the masses in drought prevention and preparedness. According to the different regions, different preliminary plans were made. The Zanshan Joint Defense area will dig old wells and repair waterwheels to irrigate more than 200 mu of land. Each person will also plant an average of one mu of dry land and ensure that none of the cotton seedlings watered for planting die from drought. The Beizhang Joint Defense area will first plant some wheat stubble land in the dry season, leaving the remaining land tilled into furrows. When it rains, they will sow seeds in the furrows to save acreage. They will also prepare to plant more vegetables, late crops, and early-maturing crops. Most villages in the other five joint defense areas, including Baicuo and Xincheng, can dig new wells to increase irrigated land. In addition to this, each village will continue to organize transportation and weaving, accumulate grain, extensively mobilize the gathering of wild vegetables, collect substitute foods, and practice strict economy. Everyone is highly enthusiastic and confident about the drought resistance struggle. To better promote and deepen this work, a meeting of key village cadres is now being convened to study detailed plans and specific implementation methods. (Kui Lin)

　　再接再厉打破等待思想
    沙河四区贯彻备荒
    【本报沙河讯】四区区干部集会总结抗旱备荒运动，作出今后计划。该区共有大小村庄四十五个，其中有十二个村全是旱地，不能打井浇地，其他三十三个村都各有一小部水地，绝大部分都是旱地，过去群众都是靠天吃饭，今年在发动抗旱备荒运动中，全区担水点种了四千多亩棉花，水地全部下了种，北掌村的七十多亩水地苗均已锄过头遍，玉茭开始锄第二遍，现仍继续浇第二水，赞善联防三个村担水点种的棉苗也普遍浇过了一次，有个别的户已浇了三次；白错、新章、新城等村除在水地阴种谷子外，并组织旱地点种玉茭。在备荒上也有成绩：新章合作社收买糠准备渡荒，河头村家家采榆叶，新城男女儿童一伙一伙的到处打野菜，西柳泉村一个小闺女一天就拾了两口袋小柿子。但根据全区情况看来，抗旱备荒还未形成大的运动，不少群众还在等天下雨，部分干部还没很好的组织和领导群众进行抗旱斗争，经过讨论，大家明确认识了干部带头领导群众防旱备荒的作用，按照不同地区，作出不同的初步计划，赞善联防要挖旧井、修水车，能多浇二百多亩地，再平均每人点种一亩旱地，并保证担水点种的棉苗不旱死一棵。北掌联防先旱耩一部麦茬地，留下的耕成沟，下了雨往沟里种省垧，并准备多种菜、晚庄稼和早熟作物，其他白错、新城等五个联防大部村能打新井增加水地，除此外各村还继续组织运输和纺织，积存粮食，大量发动采野菜，收集代食品，厉行节约。大家对抗旱斗争情绪很高，信心很大，为了更好的把这一工作提高和深入一步，现正召集各村主要干部开会，研究详细计划和具体进行办法。（奎林）
