Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, 9th: Over the past year, the land reform in the Ji-Cha-Re-Liao Liberated Area has achieved significant results. By March of this year, farmers had recovered more than 7.5 million mu of land from traitors, local bullies, and landlords, along with a large number of livestock, farm implements, grain, houses, and other materials. During the movement, more than 200,000 outstanding workers, farmers, and intellectuals joined the Communist Party, and more than 100,000 farmers joined the People's Liberation Army. In eastern Hebei (including southern Rehe), more than 2 million mu of land have been distributed. In the basic areas, out of 8,967 villages (including 777 guerrilla areas), 7,096 villages have carried out land reform, and 66% of the landlord-feudal economy has been basically destroyed. However, in some areas, it is still very incomplete, with remnants of feudal vestiges large and small. The land obtained by the vast majority of poor farmers is insufficient. In Rehe (excluding western and southern Rehe), more than 3.4 million mu of land have been distributed, and land reform has been carried out in about 65% of the villages in the basic areas. Of these, more than half are thorough or relatively thorough, and the rest are still very incomplete. The prestige of landlords and local bullies has not been defeated, the masses are not sufficiently awakened, and "open distribution but secret non-distribution" is a serious problem. In Ji-Re-Cha, a total of more than 2 million mu of land have been distributed. Most of the basic areas in northern Hebei and eastern Chahar have been initially completed, but there are still "half-cooked rice" areas. After eastern Chahar and western Rehe were occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the farmers' land was taken away again. On the whole, about one-third to one-half of the region has done well or relatively well. The other two-thirds to one-half of the region, including the Chiang-occupied areas, still need to be vigorously implemented. At present, a vigorous momentum is being used to eliminate "half-cooked rice" in the basic areas, eliminate blank areas, and carry out land reform in the guerrilla areas and recovery areas.

　　冀察热辽深入分田
    大力消灭“夹生饭”
    【新华社冀察热辽九日电】一年来冀察热辽解放区土地改革已获重大成绩。到今年三月止，农民已从汉奸、恶霸、地主手中收回七百五十余万亩土地，与大量的牲畜、农具、粮食、房屋等物资。运动中，有二十余万优秀的工人，农民与知识分子涌入共产党，十余万农民参加了人民解放军。冀东（包括热南）已分配土地二百余万亩。在基本区八千九百六十七村（其中七百七十七村为游击区）中已有七千○九十六村进行了土地改革，百分之六十六地主封建经济已基本摧毁。但有些地区仍很不彻底，残存着大大小小的封建尾巴。广大贫苦农民所得土地不足。热河（不包括热西热南）已分配三百四十余万亩土地，在基本区已进行土地改革村约占百分之六十五。其中彻底与较彻底的占一半以上，其余仍是很不彻底。地主恶霸威风未打倒，群众觉悟不够，“明分暗不分”严重存在。冀热察共分配土地二百余万亩，平北，察东基本区大部已初步完成，但仍有“夹生饭”地区。察东、热西蒋匪侵占后农民土地又被夺去。总观全区约有三分之一至二分之一地区做得好与较好。另包括蒋占区在内的二分之一至三分之二的地区仍须继续大力贯彻。现正以猛烈之势在基本区消灭“夹生饭”消灭空白地区，并开展游击区与恢复区的土地改革工作。
