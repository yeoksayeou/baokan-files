　　Our Army's Tactical Improvement

　　【Xinhua News Agency Jin-Cha-Ji, 25th】Frontline reporter Zhang Fan reports: In this Jinpu Railway Northern Section Campaign, the People's Liberation Army's tactical movements and various disciplines have shown significant progress: (1) Tactics combined bravery with technique, bringing into play the "three h狠 (ruthless) and three m猛 (fierce)" fighting method of being ruthless, more ruthless, and even more ruthless, fiercely attacking, fiercely charging, and fiercely pursuing. During the pursuit of fleeing and routed enemies in Qingxian, a certain battalion pursued for seventy li in one breath, annihilating the enemy. (2) Universal conservation of ammunition. After a battle ended, there was no random shooting. Even during battles, soldiers paid attention to saving ammunition. Some units put forward the slogan "Don't release the hawk until you see the rabbit." The Seventh Company, which was responsible for the main attack on Tangguantun, consumed ammunition this time that was one-eighth of the lowest consumption of the company in past battles. (3) Battlefield discipline, mass discipline, and entry-into-city discipline were generally good. When entering the city, soldiers automatically guarded or sealed warehouses. When the attacking troops on Qingxian had their clothes wet by rain, no one touched the clothes of the prisoners. After the liberation of Qingxian, the combat troops withdrew outside the city, and the garrison troops took over. After the liberation of Tangguantun, the troops went to a designated place to rest, and there were few troops seen on the streets. When marching, there was no random mobilization of manpower or livestock. (4) Mass work was active. Utilizing the gaps in battles to help the masses with wheat harvesting. Before attacking Qingxian, the troops also helped the villagers pull wheat.
　　
　　【Xinhua News Agency Shandong, 24th】During the battle to liberate Cangxian, turned-over peasants from the Bohai First Military Subdistrict enthusiastically participated in the war during the wheat harvest. Within four days, 20,000 militiamen and laborers, 1,000 stretchers, 3,000 carts, 200 cadres, and 1,000 district volunteer soldiers surged to the front lines. Certain counties rushed to repair two highways overnight, allowing thousands of carts to pass smoothly, transporting grain and ammunition, and pulling back spoils of victory. In Leling and other counties, 120 primary school teachers and 50 teachers and students from the First Middle School volunteered to participate in battlefield service.

　　津浦北段战役中
    我军战术提高
    【新华社晋察冀二十五日电】前线记者张帆报导：此次津浦北段战役，人民解放军某部战术动作及各种纪律均有显著进步：（一）战术上勇敢与技术结合，发挥了一狠二狠再狠，猛打猛冲猛追的“三狠三猛”战法。在追击青县逃窜溃敌时，某营一气追击七十里路，将敌歼灭。（二）普遍的节省弹药，战斗一结束即没有随便打枪的，即在战斗中战士们也注意节省弹药。有的部队提出“不见兔子不撒鹰”的口号，担任主攻唐官屯的第七连，这次消耗弹药为过去该连战斗消耗最小一次的八分之一。（三）战场纪律群众纪律入城纪律普遍良好。入城时战士们自动看守或封闭仓库。青县攻城部队衣服被雨淋湿，但没有人动俘虏的衣服。解放青县后，战斗部队即撤出城外，由卫戍部队接防。解放唐官屯后，部队即到一定地方休息，街头很少见到部队。行军时没有随便动员人力畜力。（四）群众工作活跃。利用战斗空隙帮助群众麦收，攻青县的部队战斗前还帮助老乡拔麦。
    【新华社山东二十四日电】解放沧县之战中，渤海一分区翻身农民，在麦收中踊跃参战，四天内有两万个民兵民夫，一千付担架，三千辆大车，两百个干部，千名区队志愿军涌上前线。某某等县星夜赶修两条公路，使数千辆大车顺畅通行，运去粮食、弹药，拉回胜利品。乐陵等县并有小学教师一百二十名及第一中学师生五十余自愿参加战地服务。
