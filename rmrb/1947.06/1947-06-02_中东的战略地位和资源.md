　　The importance of the Middle East, whether in wartime or peacetime, lies mainly in its strategic position and economic resources. This is particularly evident in three specific things: the Dardanelles Strait, the Suez Canal, and oil. To understand the Middle East problem after the war, one must first understand the situation of these three.

　　I. The Dardanelles Strait – The Middle East region is surrounded by four inland seas and a gulf: the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. The Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are inland seas of great strategic importance. Controlling the gateway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea is the Dardanelles Strait; in other words, this strait controls the Soviet Union's southern access to the sea. The Dardanelles is also a natural boundary dividing the continents of Europe and Asia, and it has special importance in terms of continental transportation. This strait is within the territory of Turkey. As a result of the First World War, Turkey was defeated along with Germany, and the Dardanelles Strait area was demilitarized. In fact, although Turkey itself lost control of the Dardanelles Strait, the main purpose of British and French control over the Turkish Straits area was to prevent Soviet forces from extending into the Mediterranean. As a result of the Montreux Convention of 1936, Turkey's control over the straits area was partially restored, but the Soviet Union's right of access to the sea was still restricted. During the war, Soviet-Turkish negotiations repeatedly failed to resolve this issue. However, after the end of this war, the Soviet Union became the largest power spanning the Eurasian continent. Can it continue to tolerate Turkey's shackles on this strait? At the London Foreign Ministers Conference in the autumn of 1945, the Soviet Union had already raised this issue. The Soviet Union had proposed trusteeship over Italian Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, and later requested revision of the Montreux Convention. This showed that it demanded to be recognized as a Mediterranean country.

　　II. The Suez Canal – At the southeastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, dividing Asia and Africa, is the Suez Canal. The British Empire's "lifeline" passes through the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and the most important link in this is the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is within Egyptian territory, so Britain strengthened its control over Egypt and obtained the right to station troops along the Egyptian coast and the Suez Canal area. On the other hand, Britain also strengthened its military control over Palestine along the Mediterranean coast north of the canal and the island of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea. In short, in the international struggle surrounding the Middle East, Britain regards control of the Suez Canal area as a question of the rise and fall, even life and death, of its empire. However, due to the rise of the Arab national movement, Egypt is unwilling to be controlled by Britain for a long time. After this war, Britain's national strength and status have also weakened a lot. The control problem of the Suez Canal area has become an important touchstone for the future of the British Empire.

　　III. Abundant Oil Resources – Another attraction of the Middle East to the world is its abundant oil resources. The oil reserves here account for the fourth largest in the world. The Mosul oil field in Iraq and the oil fields in southwestern Iran were Britain's largest military assets in the two world wars. "Oil is thicker than blood," and the oil struggle in the Middle East has always been the most acute. Early on, Britain and Tsarist Russia divided the oil areas in the northwest of Iran. Although the Soviet Union after the revolution announced that it would abandon its privileges in northern Iran, it stated that the Iranian government could not transfer oil rights in the north to other countries. This was obviously to prevent Iran from becoming a tool of anti-Soviet forces. In Iraq, Britain has an oil pipeline leading to the port of Haifa in Palestine, while France has another oil pipeline leading to the port of Beirut in Lebanon. The United States originally only had some oil interests on Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf, but through this war, the United States' interest in Middle Eastern oil has greatly increased. The Sinclair Oil Company of the United States has been waiting to obtain the right to exploit oil in northern Iran. When Hurley was in Iran, he maintained close relations with the Sinclair Oil Company. At the same time, during this war, the United States paid special attention to oil exploitation in Saudi Arabia. Roosevelt once sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia to negotiate the transfer of oil rights with King Ibn Saud and planned to attach an oil pipeline from Arabia through Transjordan to the Palestinian coast. Now, the Arabian American Oil Company, jointly formed by the American Mobil and Texaco oil companies, has signed a contract with King Saud, promising to give King Saud a royalty of 22.5 cents per barrel of oil, with the exploitation right being granted until 2000. This greatly intensified the oil struggle in the Middle East, because many people believe that the Soviet Union may also obtain the right to exploit oil in northern Iran (the Soviet Union and Iran signed an oil treaty in early April last year).

### 中东的战略地位和资源

　　中东的战略地位和资源
    无论在战时或平时，中东地域的重要性，主要在于它的战略地位和经济资源方面。这特别表现于三件具体东西的上面：一是达达尼尔海峡，二是苏彝士运河，三是石油。要了解战后中东问题，必须先了解这三者的情形。
    一、达达尼尔海峡——中东地域是环绕在四个内海与一个海湾之间的，即里海、黑海、地中海、红海和波斯湾，黑海和地中海都是具有很大战略重要性的内海。控制着黑海通地中海门户的是达达尼尔海峡；也就是这海峡，控制了苏联南面的出海通路。达达尼尔海又是划分欧亚两大陆的一条天然界线，在大陆交通上，也有其特殊的重要性。这海峡是在土耳其领土范围之内的。第一次大战的结果，土耳其跟着德国被击败，达达尼尔海峡地带被解除武装；事实上，土耳其本身虽然失去，对于达达尼尔海峡的控制，而英法对土耳其海峡地带的控制，更主要的目的却在于阻止苏联势力伸入地中海。一九二六年蒙特娄会议的结果，土耳其对海峡地带的控制权，虽然是部分的恢复了，但苏联的出海权还是受到限制。战争期间苏土屡次进行谈判，都不能解决这一问题。然而，这次大战结束之后，苏联成了横跨欧亚大陆最大的强国，它是否能继续忍受土耳其一这海峡的束缚呢？在一九四五年秋季伦敦外长会议上，苏联已经提出了这一问题。苏联曾提出了意属利比亚与多特喀呢斯群岛的托治权，后又提出要求修改蒙特娄条约。这表明了它要求被承认为一个地中海上的国家。
    二、苏彝士运河——在地中海东南端，划分着亚非两洲的，有着苏彝士运河。英帝国的“生命线”经过地中海而红海到印度洋，其中最重要的一个关节，就是苏彝士运河。苏彝士运河是在埃及境内的，英国因此加强控制埃及，取得了在埃及沿海及苏彝士运河地带的驻兵权。另一方面，在运河北面沿地中海岸的巴勒斯坦和地中海上的塞浦洛斯岛，英国也加强其军事的控制。总之，环绕中东的国际斗争，英国把苏彝士运河地带的控制看着它帝国兴衰甚至生与死的问题。然而由于阿拉伯民族运动的抬头，埃及不愿长期受到英国的控制，这次大战后，英国的国力和地位也削弱了不少，苏彝士运河地带的控制问题，已成为英帝国前途的一个重要试金石了。
    三、丰富的石油源——中东的另一个对于世界的吸引力，是它的丰富石油源。这里的石油藏量占世界第四位。伊拉克的摩素尔油田，伊朗西南部的油田，在两次世界大战中，都是英国的最大军事资产。“油浓于血”，中东的石油斗争一向是最尖锐的。很早的时候，英国和帝俄平分了伊朗西北两部的油区；革命后的苏联虽然宣布放弃了伊朝北部的特权，但却声明伊朗政府不能把北部的油权让与他国，这显然是为了防止伊朗成为反苏势力的工具。在伊拉克，英国有一条油管通到巴勒斯坦的海发港，法国则另有一条油管通到黎巴嫩的比路特港。美国本来只有在波斯湾上的巴林岛，保有一些石油利益，但是通过了这次战争，美国对中东石油的兴趣大为增加了。美国的辛克莱石油公司，一直等待着取得伊朗北部石油的开采权，当赫尔利在伊朗时，就是和辛克莱石油公司保持着密切关系。同时，在这次战争中，美国特别注意沙特阿拉伯的石油开采，罗斯福曾经派一个代表团到沙特阿拉伯去，和伊班苏特王谈判石油权让与问题，并且计划附设一条油管线，由阿拉伯经外约旦而通到巴勒斯坦海岸。现在是由美国的美孚和德士古尔石油公司合组的阿拉伯美国石油公司，和苏特王订约，答允给于苏特王每桶二角二分钱美金的利金，开采让与权到二○○○年为止。这大大地加强了中东的石油斗争，因为许多人认为苏联也可能取得伊朗北部的石油开采权（苏伊去年四月初已签订石油条约）。
