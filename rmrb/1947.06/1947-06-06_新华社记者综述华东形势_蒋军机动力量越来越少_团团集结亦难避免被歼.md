　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Summarizes the Situation in East China
    Chiang's Military Mobile Forces are Dwindling
    Concentrated Grouping Still Difficult to Avoid Annihilation
    [Xinhua News Agency East China Front, 3rd] Our special correspondent Zhuang Zhong reports: In the past ten months, the East China People's Liberation Army has wiped out a total of forty brigades of Chiang's regular army. Currently, Chiang has thirteen reorganized divisions, totaling thirty-two brigades, of mobile forces in East China. However, since the annihilation of the 74th Division, Chiang Kai-shek considers only the 5th Army and the 11th Division as his reliable core main forces. Although Chiang Kai-shek risks adopting the so-called "empty city tactic," he still has to use forces equal to his mobile troops to defend the occupied cities and communication lines. The defending Chiang's troops have mostly fallen into the sea of guerrilla warfare. If the Chiang's troops in East China still maintained a considerable number of mobile forces before the Tai'an campaign, then since the Tai'an campaign, the Chiang's military mobile forces have been rapidly and massively lost. In just twenty days, two reorganized divisions of Chiang's army (the 72nd and 74th divisions) were completely annihilated, and six other reorganized divisions were partially annihilated, with a total of about eight brigades, nearly 60,000 troops, being wiped out. The initiative of the war has gradually begun to shift to the hands of the People's Liberation Army. Now, the Chiang's troops invading the Yimeng Mountains, after the annihilation of the 74th Division, have encountered insurmountable difficulties by concentrating in groups. First, due to the excessive concentration of forces, the flanks are more exposed, and it is easier to be annihilated. If the flanks are composed of miscellaneous troops, everyone is even more in danger. Because once the miscellaneous troops are surrounded and annihilated, Chiang's core troops, even if they are nearby, will never reinforce them; the complete annihilation of the Sichuan Army's 72nd Division in Tai'an is an example. Second, due to the contraction and concentration of forces, it is even more impossible to encircle the People's Liberation Army; on the contrary, the People's Liberation Army can move around more freely and annihilate the enemy everywhere. Even if Chiang's main forces are concentrated together, the People's Liberation Army can strike and annihilate them at any time. The recent battles on the Lin(yi)-Meng(yin) highway at Qingtousi and Moshigou, and then the battle at Menglianggu, are clear evidence. Third, Chiang's army is suffering from insufficient troops and depleted reserves, and has no troops to transfer except to rob Peter to pay Paul. Whether it maintains its offensive or shrinks its defenses, there are always many gaps that cannot be filled by troops; for example, the Jiaoji Railway has been unable to be opened by Chiang's army for nearly three months since the Laiwu campaign; Jinan has twice become an isolated and dangerous city. Fourth, the more Chiang's army concentrates its forces on the front line, the more empty the rear becomes, and the more it is threatened by the People's Liberation Army guerrillas. Now, only a few miscellaneous troops and disabled Chiang's puppet troops are guarding the Jinpu and Longhai railways. The six regiments of the puppet Wu Huawen's New 10th Division are guarding cities such as Ningyang, Jining, Ziyang, Qufu, and Zou County, as well as many communication lines. As for the Central China liberated area south of the Longhai Railway and north of the Yangtze River, Chiang's military strength is particularly weak. Chiang's rear guerrilla corps will soon accumulate small victories into big victories, and in most areas, it will complete the initiative and soon form a two-pronged attack on Chiang's army with the frontal main forces. Fifth, Chiang's army penetrates deep into the old liberated areas, and the transportation of food and ammunition is increasingly difficult to solve; especially in the mountainous area of central Shandong, which stretches for hundreds of miles, vehicles cannot pass except for a few rugged and narrow roads; although Chiang's army can rely on looting, there is now nothing to loot, and the people have long since thoroughly emptied their houses and cleared the fields. Therefore, Chiang's army is not only completely cut off from food sources when surrounded, but is also on the verge of desperation even when it has not been surrounded. In short, no matter how many troops Chiang Kai-shek concentrates, and no matter what strategy or tactics he adopts, if Chiang's army does not revolt early, does not automatically lay down its arms, and withdraw from the civil war, it will definitely be destroyed in the same way as the 74th Division.

　　新华社记者综述华东形势
    蒋军机动力量越来越少
    团团集结亦难避免被歼
    【新华社华东前线三日电】本社特派记者庄重报导：过去十个月华东人民解放军共歼灭蒋正规军四十个旅。现在，蒋在华东机动兵力还有十三个整编师，共三十二个旅。但自七十四师覆灭后，蒋介石认为可靠的部队只有第五军和十一师两个嫡系主力。虽然蒋介石冒险采用所谓“空心战术”，但他还不能不以与机动兵力相等的部队守备侵占城市和交通线。而守备之蒋军，大部已坠入游击战争火海。如果说，在泰安战役前，华东蒋军还保持相当数量的机动力量；那么，自泰安战役后，蒋军机动力量便迅速地大批丧失了。仅仅在二十天内，蒋军有两个整编师（七十二师、七十四师）全部被歼，另有六个整编师部分被歼，总共被歼约八个旅，近六万人的兵力。战争主动权开始逐渐转移到人民解放军手中。现在开始侵入沂蒙山区的蒋军在七十四师覆灭后，团团集结，已遭遇重重不可克服的困难。第一，由于兵力过于集结，侧翼愈加暴露，愈易遭受歼灭，而侧翼如系杂牌部队，更是人人自危。因杂牌军一旦被围歼时，蒋嫡系军虽近在咫尺，亦绝不增援；川军七十二师全歼于泰安即为一例。第二，由于兵力收缩集结，愈不能包围人民解放军；相反，人民解放军更加能纵横自如，到处回旋运动歼敌。即使蒋军主力都集中一起，人民解放军也随时可以一举击破而歼灭之。最近一战临（沂）蒙（阴）公路青驼寺磨石沟，再战孟良崮，便是明证。第三，蒋军由于兵力不足，后备枯竭，除拆东墙补西墙外，无兵可调。而维持其进攻也好，收缩防御也好，总是有许多缺口没有兵力填补；例如胶济路自莱芜战役以后，迄今近三个月，蒋军无力打通；济南已两次成为孤立的危城。第四，蒋军愈把兵力集中第一线，后方便愈加空虚，则愈受解放军游击队的威胁。现在津浦、陇海两条大铁路线，只有少数杂牌军和残废的蒋伪军担任守备。伪吴化文新十师六个团即看守宁阳、济宁、滋阳、曲阜、邹县等城市及许多交通线。至于陇海路以南、长江以北的华中解放区内，蒋军兵力尤其薄弱。蒋后的游击兵团即将积小胜为大胜，在大部分地区完成掌握主动，不久将与正面主力形成两面夹击蒋军的态势。第五，蒋军深入老解放区，交通运输粮弹供应愈加无法解决；特别是鲁中丛山峻岭绵延数百里，除几条崎岖狭窄的公路外，车辆不能通行；虽蒋军可以依赖抢劫，但现亦无物可抢，人民早已彻底空舍清野。所以蒋军不但在被包围时完全断绝饮食的来源，即在尚未被包围时亦濒于绝境。总之，不论蒋介石集中多少部队，采用什么战略战术，如果蒋军不及早起义，不自动放下武器，退出内战，便一定要与七十四师同样毁灭。
