Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 9th. The Jin-Sui organs and troops are vigorously carrying out production and conservation. Border region-level organs are planting large quantities of melons and vegetables. The number of pumpkin seedlings that have already sprouted has reached 20,000. Each organ is planting around ten mu of vegetables. On average, each member of the CCP branch bureau (Ma) and cook is planting 160 melon seedlings, which is conservatively estimated to be enough for four months of food. All organs are currently reclaiming wasteland and planting short-term, drought-resistant crops. The military region's headquarters and political department have already planted over 1,400 mu. Regarding conservation, all organs have uniformly stipulated that each person should save four liang of rice per day, reduce the consumption of wheat-based foods, eat more porridge, and prohibit using leftover food to feed pigs. In addition, the streamlining of organization will continue, reducing personnel and horses. The branch bureau has already reduced personnel by 16 people and sent away six livestock. Cadre family members have also decided to be assigned work or return home to engage in production. The administrative office has also formulated methods for saving office expenses.

    精简人员节约粮食
    【新华社晋绥九日电】晋绥各机关部队厉行生产节约，边区级机关大量种植瓜菜，已出苗南瓜即达两万窝。各机关种菜均在十亩上下。中共分局马、伙夫每人平均种瓜达百六十苗，最低估计足顶四个月食粮。各机关均正开荒播短期耐旱作物，军区司、政两部已播种一千四百余亩。节约方面各机关统一规定：每人一天节约食米四两，减少面食，多吃稀饭，禁止剩饭喂猪。并继续紧缩编制，减少人员马匹。分局已减少人员十六人，送走牲口六头，干部家属亦决定分配工作或还家生产，行署并订出办公费节约办法。
