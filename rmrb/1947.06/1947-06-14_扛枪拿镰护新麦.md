Old folks, don't panic! Let's talk about the famine years of the past:
When the Chiang troops fled and the Japanese came, the people of northern Henan suffered a great calamity.
Furniture and food were all looted, and most of the houses were burned down.
Unfortunately, we suffered from drought year after year, with no water in the wells and the grass dried up.
We watered and irrigated, but only a small portion of the autumn seedlings emerged.
Locusts came, rampaging everywhere, sweeping everything clean.
Young people saw no way out and ran away.
Young wives wept, following whoever had food to eat for a few years.
Some fled to Xuzhou, others to the mountains.
Children and wives all ran away, and no one cared for the old folks.
Selling children and fields to exchange for some grain to survive the famine.
What little they had left, they couldn't bear to eat, but the heartless "puppet army" came to grab it all.
Landlords and bullies intensified their exploitation, and most of the people died.

Since the Communist Party came, the people have finally seen the light of day.
We have food to eat and clothes to wear, and we celebrate the New Year with joy.
Chiang Kai-shek didn't like it and wouldn't let the people stand up.
He was determined to be a dictator and sit as emperor, mobilizing troops to fight a civil war.
Occupying the cities wasn't enough; he sent troops to the countryside to grab grain.
If the people didn't have the Communist Party, it would be all over.
The Eighth Route Army, true heroes, helped the people stand up.
In total, they fought for ten months, eliminating hundreds of thousands of his troops.
The stubborn troops were eager to escape, but their eyes turned red when they saw the wheat turning yellow.
They organized many grain-grabbing teams, preparing to steal our wheat when it was ripe.
Comrades, be serious, the people are our lifeline.
Party, government, army, and people, all united, protect the wheat harvest and fight the enemy.
Shoulder your guns, grab your sickles, and run to the enemy's city.
Help the villagers harvest wheat when nothing is happening, and put down the sickle if there's any movement.
If the enemy tries to steal our wheat, prepare to wipe them out!
The villagers harvest wheat outside the city, while the enemy glares from the city walls.
The enemy dares not open the city gates, and it's hard for them to get steamed buns.
The enemy has no food in the city, and everyone is starving and screaming.
From afar, they look like living ghosts; up close, they look like opium addicts.
Don't even talk about asking them to fight; a strong wind could blow them over on the plain.
Just wait until we finish harvesting the wheat, then the army and people will cooperate and advance to the front line.
Once the guns fire, we'll enter the city and wipe out the enemy.
The army and the people are happy, happily eating white flour, happily eating white flour.

Su Xiaozhuang is from Qinghua. He came from a poor family of artists. He is twenty-eight years old this year and is now a member of the Daoqing Cultural Troupe. He has never been to school, but he has composed countless kuaiban performances himself. As long as you give him a theme and tell him how to compose it, he will speak it out on the spot, truly "speaking into a clapper talk," reflecting reality quickly and truthfully. Whenever he is in a place with many people, he runs over to perform a clapper talk, reporting new victory news. When he performs for soldiers in the army, it greatly boosts morale. The instructors and clerks of the team, as well as some comrades who love culture and entertainment, all go to copy his clapper talks. Now his clapper talks are loved by almost everyone in the Fourth Military District. Wherever he goes, people want him to perform. (Hong Fei)

　　扛枪拿镰护新麦
    苏小庄
    老乡们，不要乱！谈一谈过去的灾荒年：
    蒋军败走日本来，豫北人民遭大难。
    家具粮食都抢光，房屋烧了一大半。
    不幸连年遭荒旱，井里没水草旱干。
    又是浇，又是灌，秋苗出了一少半。
    出蝗虫，遍地乱，一扫而光吃个干。
    年轻人一看没法办，一拍屁股逃外边。
    年轻媳妇泪涟涟，谁有饭吃就跟他过几年。
    有人逃在徐州府，有人逃亡山上边。
    孩子媳妇都逃走，老头老婆没人管。
    卖孩子、卖庄田，换点粮食渡荒年。
    剩下一点不舍吃，狠心“皇协军”来抢干。
    老财恶霸加紧剥削，人民死了一大半。
　
    自从来了共产党，人民才算见青天。
    又有吃，又有穿，欢欢乐乐过个年。
    蒋介石一看不顺眼，不让人民把身翻。
    一心独裁坐皇帝，调动大兵打内战。
    占了城市还不算，乡下抢粮派吃饭。
    人民没有共产党，那就算是完了蛋。
    八路军，真好汉，帮助人民把身翻。
    共总打了十个月，消灭他大兵百十万。
    顽固军有心想逃走，看见麦黄红了眼。
    组织很多抢粮队，准备麦熟来抢咱。
    同志们，要认真，老百姓就是咱们养命根。
    党政军民一条心，保护收麦跟敌拚。
    扛上枪，拿上镰，大家跑到敌人城跟前。
    没事帮助老乡把麦割，有点动静放下镰。
    敌人要是把麦抢，准备把它消灭完！
    老乡城外把麦割，敌人城上干瞪眼。
    敌人不敢开城门，想吃蒸馍难上难。
    敌人城里没饭吃，个个饿他乱叫唤；
    远看好像活小鬼，近看又似吃大烟；
    不用说叫他来打仗，大风一刮倒在地平川。
    单等咱们收麦后，军民合作上前线。
    枪一响，进了城，敌人消灭干干净。
    军和民，都喜欢，高高兴兴吃白面，高高兴兴吃白面。
    苏小庄是清化人，旧艺人出身，家里很穷苦，今年二十八岁了，现在道清文工团当团员。他没上过学，但经他自己编的快板已数不清有几个了。只要你给他出个主题，告诉他如何编，他就会随口说出来，真是“出口成板”，反映现实快而真实。逢到老百姓多的地方，他就跑过去说个快板，报告些新胜利消息。在部队给战士说，很能鼓励士气；队上的指导员、文书，一些爱好文化娱乐的同志，都去抄他的快板。现在他的快板，在四分区已几乎人人热爱，无论他到什么地方，见了就要他说。（洪飞）
