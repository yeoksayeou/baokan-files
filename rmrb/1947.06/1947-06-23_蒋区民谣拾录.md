A Collection of Ballads from the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
Su Zhong, editor

The following ballads were recounted by liberated soldiers. They are popular songs from the South. From them, we can see the suffering in the hearts of the people in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas and how dark their lives are.

        I.
The sky is full of stars, but the moon is dim,
The pond is full of fish, but the waves don't cease,
Too many Chiang soldiers mess up the country,
Too many lovers ruin their lives!
(The Kuomintang army has been harming the people too fiercely for twenty years. The people have fully recognized Chiang Kai-shek's crime of harming the country and afflicting the people with his military power.)

        II.
In earlier years I miscalculated,
Carrying a gun, killing enemies, not caring for my home,
If I had known that victory would be like this,
I'd rather have gone to a deep mountain to become a monk.
(After the victory against Japan, Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war deeply disappointed the people who resisted the enemy and the unemployed soldiers.)

        III.
Dark clouds hang across the sky,
Wanting to drizzle, wanting to be sunny,
Even drizzle has a sunny day,
When will the poor people ever turn over?
(Under the dark rule of the Four Big Families, the poor long for liberation).

        IV.
It's good to sleep until the sky is bright,
Getting rich in old age, one's life won't be long,
Newly harvested rice, a hollow joy,
Just wanting to eat, then you have to hand it over as military grain!
(After a year of hard work, the newly harvested grain hasn't even been tasted before it's forcibly taken as military grain.)

        V.
Tired feet make it hard to climb hills,
It's hard for the poor to get through April's famine,
Thirsty, it's hard to wait for a newly dug well,
Hungry, it's hard to wait for the early rice to ripen!
(This is the people's understanding of Chiang Kai-shek's countless empty promises in politics. Chiang Kai-shek's sweet words can no longer deceive the people!)

        VI.
It's hard to go out, hard to come in,
How many birds in the woods,
During the day afraid of being shot at,
At night afraid of mountain fires.
(Special agents run rampant in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas, and the people live in terror and worry day and night!)

        VII.
My body is in the army, but my heart is at home,
My young wife is a flower,
I want to go home, but I can't,
Chiang Kai-shek is a big tortoise!
(This is sung by Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers. They hope to go home peacefully, but since they can't, they can only scold Chiang Kai-shek to vent their anger!)

　　蒋区民谣拾录
    苏众辑
    下面的民谣，是解放战士谈出来的，是南方很流行的歌，从这里我们可以看出蒋管区老百姓心里的痛苦，他们过着多么黑暗的生活。
            一、
    天上星多月不明，
    塘里鱼多浪不停，
    太多蒋军搅乱国，
    太多情人坏了身！
    （国民党的军队，二十年来扰害老百姓太凶了，老百姓充分认识了蒋介石凭借武力，祸国殃民的罪恶。）
            二、
    早年算盘打得差，
    背枪杀敌不顾家，
    早知胜利是像此，
    不如深山去出家。
    （抗战胜利后，蒋贼内战独裁，使抗敌人民及失业军人大失所望。）
            三、
    ＠多乌云天上横，
    又想飘雨又想晴，
    飘雨还有天晴日，
    穷人几时才翻身？
    （在四大家族黑暗统治下，穷人渴望着翻身）。
        四、
    天亮好睡天又亮，
    临老发财命不长，
    新割黄谷空欢喜，
    刚想下肚征军粮！
    （一年辛苦，刚收获的谷子，还没有尝新，又被迫缴了军粮）。
            五、
    脚倦行路难过岗，
    穷人难过四月荒，
    口渴难等新开井，
    肚饥难等早稻黄！
    （这是蒋贼在政治上无数次空头支票，所给老百姓的认识，蒋贼的花言巧语，再骗不了老百姓了！）
            六、
    出又难来入又难，
    几多鸟雀树林间，
    日里又怕＠来打，
    夜里又怕火烧山。
    （蒋管区特务横行，人民白日黑夜过着恐怖忧虑的生活！）
            七、
    人在军营心在家，
    少年妻子一枝花，
    想家有家归不得，
    蒋介石是个大王八！
    （这是蒋军的士兵唱的，他们盼望和平回家，但有家归不得，就只好骂蒋贼出气！）
