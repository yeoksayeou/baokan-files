　　Farmers Recover Large Amounts of Land

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd—In the newly recovered areas of the Bohai Sea region, including the six counties of Yi, Shou, Lin, Zi, Huantai, Zouping, and the two cities of Zhangdian and Zhoucun, land reform has been initially completed in more than 500 villages. According to incomplete statistics, farmers have gained 120,000 mu of spring land and wheat seedlings, more than 500 head of livestock, and a portion of grain seeds and farm tools in the struggle against traitors for revenge and against counter-settlements. Village militia self-defense forces have also been generally established with poor peasants as the backbone. In Jinling Town, a Protect-the-Fields Brigade was established, and more than 20 emancipated activists simultaneously signed up to participate.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th—The counties of Changan, Jiaogao, Gaomi, Linshu, and Huantai in the newly recovered areas along the Jiaoji Railway have universally launched the movement of anti-traitor grievances and land reform. In Changan County, out of 278 villages, 211 have initiated reasonable struggle, and 91 villages have initially completed land reform. After farmers obtained more than 20,000 mu of land, they all rose up to protect their land. In the Zhuma District alone, more than 100 young people joined the Protect-the-Fields Brigade. In the three districts of Baicheng in Gaomi, farmers in more than 60 villages have obtained more than 5,000 mu of land. In Jiaogao County, all four districts including Jiaolai have been initially completed by mid-month, and the districts near the railway will be distributed by the end of the month. After the initial completion of land reform in Jiaolai District, more than 6,000 people collectively celebrated their emancipation, and more than 1,000 farmers automatically joined the militia on the spot. In Huantai and Jinling towns, more than 2,000 people publicly tried and executed Li Yinru, a major traitor who relied on Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime and murdered more than 10 activists in order to carry out counter-settlements. More than 800 people in Yong'an Town, Zhoucun City, also settled accounts with Li Zijing, the two successive Chiang Kai-shek puppet town chiefs, on the 18th. This traitor colluded with the enemy and puppets to plunder 80 mu of land and more than 100 houses and lots. When the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied the area, he bought the position of town chief for several million yuan, and embezzled more than 40 million yuan in Hebei currency in three months. The city's democratic government confiscated his property according to law to compensate the masses, which greatly pleased the people.
