　　Gaoyi Launches Crash Planting Campaign
    Over 20,000 People Participate in Mutual Aid
    Dongzhang, Combined with Production, Discovers Landlords Concealing 60 Mu of Land
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Gaoyi] The masses in Gaoyi County have been largely organized to implement equal-value exchange combined with labor and military affairs, achieving brilliant results in the crash planting campaign. Under the call of the Party, from April 23rd to May 23rd, in one month, 2,099 mutual aid teams were organized, including 12,908 households, with 31,774 laborers, accounting for 69.6% of the county's full and semi-auxiliary labor force. Among these, 558 teams, with 3,451 households and 8,862 laborers, engaged in regular mutual aid with sound systems and implemented equal-value exchange. 1,215 teams, with 7,283 households and 16,614 laborers, engaged in regular mutual aid but with less sound systems. 336 teams, with 2,174 households and 6,298 laborers, engaged in temporary mutual aid. During the upsurge of the crash planting campaign, waterwheels turned day and night, men, women, young, and old all pitched in, and there was no idle person at home or in the fields. The entire county's male, female, full, and semi-auxiliary labor force was swept into this movement. In one month, 40,518.3 mu of cotton, 5,627.5 mu of sorghum, 3,415 mu of corn, 44,321.6 mu of millet, and 11,509 mu of other miscellaneous grains and vegetables were sown, totaling 153,391.4 mu. 56,268 mu of wheat fields were irrigated throughout the county. At the same time, the masses' fear of getting rich was broken. In one month, 54 mules, 279 donkeys, and 167 oxen were purchased. In terms of organization and leadership, in accordance with the conditions and demands of the new district border areas, the first step was a top-down call to action, mobilizing activists to connect with other activists to lead the peasants to organize. The newly emancipated peasants in the new districts participated in mutual aid with some degree of blindness, but the leadership must boldly let go, universally organize, provide concrete guidance, and believe in and promote the wisdom of the peasants, creating models to promote the general. However, mutual aid teams should not be made complete and flawless all at once, or the old district's system of equal-value exchange, fixed point work calculation, and labor exchange should not be transplanted wholesale. Various systems must be established on the basis of the masses feeling the need and then on their conscious basis. In the actual process of mutual aid, meeting systems, equal-value exchange, and methods of work calculation and scoring will naturally gradually form from simple to complex. Only with such mutual aid can the organization be most solid. At the same time, combined with production, re-investigation was carried out. After multiple investigations, feudal landlords still secretly hid property and spread rumors to sabotage. Licun discovered 400 pieces of clothing during production, and Dongzhang Village discovered that 10 landlord households owned 60 mu of wheat fields (irrigated land). The landlords also spread rumors, saying that the Central Army would arrive from April to September, and that after the autumn harvest, the Eighth Route Army would transport all the grain away, creating thoughts of a changing world to sabotage production, but they were all exposed by the masses with facts. On the other hand, the peasants promoted class friendship, helping the poor brothers who had not yet been emancipated to turn over. Licun helped Dongbian Village with 230 mu of land, and cadres in Xifu Village consciously and voluntarily returned 23 mu of land, 68 shi of grain, and 20,000 yuan of Jicha banknotes. The relationship between cadres and the masses is extremely harmonious. (Cheng Zhi, Wen Yan)

　　高邑突击下种中
    两万余人参加互助
    结合生产东张查出地主瞒地六十亩
    【本报高邑讯】高邑全县群众已大部组织起来，实行了等价交换劳武结合，在突击下种运动中获得辉煌成绩。在党的号召下自四月廿三日至五月廿三日一个月中，组织起互助组二千零九十九组，包括一万二千九百零八户。三万一千七百七十四个劳力，占全县全半辅助劳力百分之六十九点六。经常互助、制度健全、实行等价交换的五百五十八组、三千四百五十一户、八千八百六十二个劳力。经常互助、制度不甚健全的一千二百一十五组、七千二百八十三户、一万六千六百一十四个劳力。临时互助的三百三十六组、二千一百七十四户、六千二百九十八个劳力。在突击下种热潮中，水车连夜转，男女老少齐动手，家里地里没闲人，全县男女全半辅助劳力全部卷入这一运动。一月中下种棉花四○五一八·三亩，高粱五六二七·五亩，玉茭三四一五亩，谷子四四三二一·六亩，其他杂粮菜一一五○九亩，共计一五三三九一·四亩。全县浇麦田五六二六八亩。同时打破了群众怕发家的思想，一月里买骡子五四头，驴二七九头，牛一六七头。在组织与领导上，适合新区边地情况与群众要求，首先是自上而下的号召，动员积极分子串通积极分子带领农民组织起来。新区的翻身农民参加互助是多少带有一点盲目性的，但领导上必须大胆放手，普遍组织，具体指导，相信并发扬农民的聪明智慧，创造典型推动一般。但不能把互助组一下弄的完整无缺，或把老区等价交换定分折工、变工制度的一套原封搬来，必须在群众感到需要，而后在他们自觉的基础上建立各种制度。在实际互助过程中，会议制度等价交换以及折工记分办法，自会由简单到复杂逐渐形成。也只有这样互助，组织才能最巩固。同时，结合生产又进行了复查。经过多次和几次复查，封建地主仍暗藏财物造谣破坏，里村在生产中又查出衣服四百件、东张村十户地主拥有六十亩（水地）麦田。地主们并造谣说：中央军四月至九月就过来了，互助生产秋后八路军就要把粮食都运走；制造变天思想破坏生产，结果都被群众用事实揭穿了。另方面农民发扬了阶级友爱，帮助未翻身的穷弟兄翻身，里村帮助了东边庄土地二三○亩，西富村干部自觉自动退出二三亩地，六八石粮食二万元冀钞。干群关系极为融洽。（成之、文彦）
