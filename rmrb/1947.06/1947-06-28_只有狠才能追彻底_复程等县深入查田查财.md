Only Ruthlessness Ensures Thorough Pursuit
Fucheng and Other Counties Deepen Land and Property Investigation

[Reported from the JiluYu area on the 26th of this month by this newspaper] While resisting enemy "sweeps," Fucheng, Dingtao, and other counties are simultaneously investigating land. In Fucheng County, farmers in over 900 villages distributed land and property in twenty days. Some cadres, seeing such a large-scale land reform movement, began to develop complacency, thinking, "This time, it's been done thoroughly!" As cadres relaxed slightly, the work was not carried out deeply enough, the fruits of the labor were not processed in a timely manner, and most of the masses did not receive the benefits. In Qingheji, poor families of martyrs and soldiers only received thirty-odd jin of grain, the average received ten jin, and some only received two jin. The masses demanded a "second fire" (re-investigation). The county committee immediately convened a district cadre meeting, calling for overcoming complacency. Villages quickly transitioned to reinvestigation. The first district convened a mass meeting of over ten thousand farmers, calling on all farmers to implement reinvestigation. Qingheji immediately assigned tasks that night, with the children's corps acting as sentries, the joint defense team responsible for digging tunnels, and the farmers' association and women's association leading the investigation of land and property. A joint committee was established to unify actions. That night, landlords were arrested. When a landlord in Qi Village refused to hand over hidden wealth, farmers used three lashes of a whip, which extracted seven large packages. In Dong Village, over 10,000 jin of wheat were also recovered. The masses realized that landlords had a lot of possessions, and only ruthlessness could ensure a thorough pursuit. The reinvestigation movement became even more enthusiastic. In Dingtao, the reinvestigation revealed that land reform in many villages was not thorough. Each landlord still possessed more than eight mu of land per person, and hidden wealth was scattered and concealed. In early May, a joint struggle was organized, and landlords were detained, recovering more than 15,000 jin of grain. Villages immediately transitioned to reinvestigation, establishing gun squads for self-defense while actively launching a "second fire" struggle against the landlords. Some villages temporarily relocated when the enemy came, and immediately returned to distribute land after the enemy left. When the enemy swept into one village, all the men, women, and children moved to other villages to continue holding meetings to evaluate and distribute land. The land reform fervor spread to villages near enemy strongholds. People in the border areas also requested cadres to help them distribute land and property. After land distribution in Dapaoli and other villages, steel gun squads were immediately formed to armedly protect the gains. Joint defenses were widely established in the border areas. Earlier this month, the enemy again concentrated 3,000 troops to "sweep" the central area of Fucheng County, using tactics such as simultaneous advances and encirclements at dawn, attempting to eliminate our militia and guerrillas. We responded with surprise attacks on the enemy's rear, causing the enemy to retreat in panic each time they "swept." Therefore, the land reform movement could still proceed smoothly.

　　只有狠才能追彻底
    复程等县深入查田查财
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】复程、定陶等县在敌人连续“扫荡”中，一面反扫荡，一面查田。复程县在二十天中有九百多村农民分地分财，部分干部看到这样大规模的土地改革运动，开始产生了自满情绪，以为“这一次弄的可彻底啦”。干部稍微一松劲，结果工作未能很好深入，果实未及时处理，大部群众未得到果实，青合集贫苦抗属才分了卅来斤粮食，一般的分到十斤，有的只分到二斤，群众纷纷要求查“二火”（复查）。县委会马上召开了区干会议，提出克服自满情绪，各村很快转入复查，一区召开了万余农民大会，号召全体农民贯彻复查，青合集当晚就分了工，儿童团站岗放哨，联防队负责挖地道，农会长妇会长领导查田查财，并建立了联席会，统一行动，当晚把地主押起来。七村地主有浮财不拿出来，被农民三马鞭子打出了七个大包袱，冬村也追出了麦子一万多斤。群众认识了地主东西多，只有狠才能追得彻底，复查运动更加热烈。定陶在复查中发现很多村土地改革都很不彻底，地主每家每人还有八亩多地，浮财都分散隐藏了，五月初组织了联合斗争，把地主扣押起来，又追出粮食一万五千多斤，于是各村立时转入复查，一面成立枪班自卫，一面积极向地主展开查“二火”斗争。有些村庄敌人来了暂时转移一下，敌人走了马上回去分地，敌人扫荡到这一个村时，全村男女老少就搬到别的村去仍旧开会评议分田，敌人走了再回村去，土地改革热潮波及到敌据点附近的村庄。边缘区的老百姓亦纷纷要求干部去帮助他们分地分财，大炮集等村分田后，马上成立钢枪班，武装保卫果实。边缘区群众普遍建立了联防，本月初敌人又集中三千兵力“扫荡”我复程县中心区，用分进合击，夜间行动，拂晓包围等办法，企图消灭我民兵游击队，我则以奇兵突袭敌人后方，打击敌人使敌每次“扫荡”均怆惶退回，因此土地改革运动仍能顺利进行。
