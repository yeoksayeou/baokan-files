Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. The spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) today revealed to this agency one of the latest major conspiracies of the traitor Jiang Jieshi: this conspiracy involves using fascist methods of mass arrests and mass killings to suppress the democratic and student movements in the Jiang-controlled areas. This conspiracy was jointly planned by Jiang Jieshi and Chen Lifu, and they decided that from the end of May to the beginning of June, they would carry out large-scale arrests of members of the Democratic League, student leaders, journalists, cultural figures, and other democrats in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Guiyang, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Kaifeng, Kunming, Xi'an, and other places. After the arrests, some would be secretly killed on the spot, while the rest would be sent to "the CCP area" under the pretext of repatriation, either being sent to the front lines to be killed in the war or pushed into the sea to drown during transportation. The CCP Central Spokesperson pointed out that this insidious plan of Jiang Jieshi is currently being personally overseen by the secret service head Chen Lifu, and some of those arrested in various places have already been secretly executed by Jiang Jieshi's secret agents. The spokesperson pointed out that Jiang Jieshi's poisonous scheme will not save him from collapse in the slightest, but will only accelerate his demise. The spokesperson called on all democratic people at home and abroad to expose Jiang Jieshi's poisonous scheme and rescue the arrested patriotic youth and democrats. The spokesperson finally pointed out that the Chinese people will certainly hold Jiang Jieshi, Chen Lifu, and others fully responsible for all the fascist atrocities they have committed, and the time for the final reckoning is not far off.

　　中共中央发言人揭露蒋党阴谋迫害民主人士
    指出人民最后清算血债已为时不远
    【新华社陕北十四日电】中共中央发言人今日向本社记者揭露卖国贼蒋介石最近的大阴谋之一，这个阴谋就是以大批逮捕大批屠杀的法西斯手段，把蒋管区的民主运动与学生运动镇压下去。这个阴谋是蒋介石与陈立夫共同计划的，他们决定从五月底六月初起，分别在上海、南京、北平、天津、汉口、长沙、重庆、贵阳、广州、福州、杭州、青岛、开封、昆明、西安等地，大批逮捕民主同盟盟员、学生领袖、新闻记者、文化人士及其他民主人士。逮捕之后，一部就地秘密杀死，其余则以“遣送至中共区”为名，或则押送前线在战争中杀死，或则在押解途中推入海中溺死。中共中央发言人指出：蒋介石的这一毒计，现正由特务头子陈立夫亲自主持执行，现在各地被捕者中有一部分已被蒋介石特务秘密处死。发言人指出：蒋介石的这个毒计，丝毫不能挽救他的崩溃，恰恰只会加速其死亡。发言人号召中外一切民主人士来揭破蒋介石的毒计和营救被捕的爱国青年与民主人士。发言人最后指出：中国人民一定要蒋介石、陈立夫等对他们所做的一切法西斯暴行负全部责任，最后清算的时候并不远了。
