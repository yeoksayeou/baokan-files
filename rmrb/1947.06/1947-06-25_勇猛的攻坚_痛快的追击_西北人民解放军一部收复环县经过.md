　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 23rd: Frontline reporters report on the recovery of Huan County, Longdong, stating: Huan County is situated in a large north-south river valley, with high mountains to the east and west dotted with fortifications and bunkers. The western high mountains are a crucial defensive position for Huan County, with Wangjia Yuan, five li high, at the core of this position. Chiang and Ma's troops spent over two months fortifying this high ground, constructing a series of outer trenches, hidden bunkers, bomb shelters, and communication trenches, completely arming the entire mountain. They believed that these strong fortifications would ensure their continued oppression of the people in Huan County. However, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, after only seven hours of battle, completely routed Ma Hongbin's forces, driving them out of Huan County. At dawn on the 16th, the People's Liberation Army launched a three-pronged attack: One route bypassed Wangjia Yuan along the southwestern high mountains; the People's Liberation Army used effective tactics to circle behind the large bunkers of Wangjia Yuan, then used powerful firepower from the mountain ridge to suppress the enemy below. Another route went directly between Wangjia Yuan and its forward position, Yuhuang Mountain, breaking through the enemy's flanking fire, advancing with each attack, and ascending the four-li-high mountain slope. The third route launched an uphill attack from below Yuhuang Mountain. Dense artillery smoke and dust tightly enveloped Wangjia Yuan, and the People's Liberation Army's accurately aimed cannons directly caused Chiang and Ma's troops to bleed from their ears and noses. Wang Zirong, the artillery platoon leader of a certain unit, a former Kuomintang artillery officer who had recently been liberated, scored a direct hit on a bunker on Yuhuang Mountain with his third shot. As the smoke cleared, the People's Liberation Army, attacking from below, leaped up and occupied Yuhuang Mountain. The other two routes took advantage of the momentum to advance rapidly, and Chiang and Ma's troops scrambled down Wangjia Yuan in disarray, fleeing east. The People's Liberation Army pursued them into the county seat, and all the heavy weapons accumulated by Ma Hongbin over the past decade were abandoned in the city. Four mountain guns and two direct-fire guns were left in the streets, and four brand-new trucks loaded with ammunition were also left behind. Dozens of camels and hundreds of donkeys carrying military supplies ran wild on the river滩. In their desperate attempt to escape, Chiang and Ma's troops abandoned these cumbersome items and Huan County, engaging in a frantic light-equipment race. But the People's Liberation Army followed closely behind, so everything felt like a burden to Chiang and Ma's troops; machine guns were abandoned, rifles were discarded, cotton coats were dropped, and even shoes were lost. Feet were cut, and heads were bruised. Many people collapsed by the roadside and fell unconscious, or fell asleep on piles of grass. Load after load of ammunition was returned to Huan County along the People's Liberation Army's pursuit route, and groups of captives, eyes closed and mouths twisted, were escorted back to Huan County. The common saying "溃不成军" [a routed army, disintegrating into chaos] was something that Ma Hongbin's troops, fighting a civil war for Chiang Kai-shek, experienced firsthand this time.

　　勇猛的攻坚·痛快的追击
    西北人民解放军一部收复环县经过
    【新华社西北前线二十三日电】前线记者报导收复陇东环县经过称：环县城在一条南北向的大川里，东西高山上布满了大小工事与碉堡，西边高山是防守环县的重要阵地，其中五里高的王家塬，则是这重要阵地的核心。蒋马军在这高山上花了两个多月工夫，修起一系列的外壕、暗碉堡、避弹室、交通沟，把整个山头都武装起来了。他们满以为这些强固的工事，能够保障他们在环县蹂躏人民。但是，我西北人民解放军一部，只经过了七小时的战斗，就把马鸿宾全部击溃，赶出环县。十六日拂晓，解放军分三路进攻：一路沿西南高山抄袭王家塬；解放军以有效的战术，绕到王家塬大碉堡的背后，然后从大山梁上，用强大火力向下压。一路直插王家塬与其前卫工事玉皇山之间，冲破敌人两面火力的夹击，随打随进，一直攻上四里多高的山坡。一路由玉皇山下向上仰攻。浓密的炮火烟雾与尘土，紧紧地笼罩着王家塬，炮炮命中的解放军大炮，直震得蒋马军耳鼻流血。某部炮兵排长王自荣，是最近解放过来的蒋军炮长，他第三炮正中玉皇山碉堡，炮烟刚刚腾起，从下仰攻之解放军一跃而上，占领了玉皇山。其余两路更趁势猛进，蒋马军的连跑带滚，逃下王家塬向东山狼狈溃败。解放军跟踪追进县城，马鸿宾十几年来积储下来的重武器，全部丢在城里。四门山炮和二门平射炮留在街上，四辆满载弹药的崭新汽车，也留在街上。驮着军火的三十几个骆驼与百多个毛驴，在河滩上乱跑。蒋马军为了逃命，丢下了这些笨重家伙、丢下了环县城后，拚命进行轻装大赛跑。但是人民解放军则紧紧跟在后面，于是一切对于蒋马军都感到累赘了；机枪丢了，步枪也丢了，棉衣丢了，鞋子也跑掉了，脚碰破了，头也碰破了。跑着跑着，很多人倒在路旁昏死了，倒在草堆上睡下了。一驮驮的枪弹，沿着解放军追击路线再返回环县，一群群闭眼歪嘴的俘虏，跟着押回环县。人们常说的“溃不成军”，为蒋介石打内战的马鸿宾部，这一次尝到这个滋味了。
