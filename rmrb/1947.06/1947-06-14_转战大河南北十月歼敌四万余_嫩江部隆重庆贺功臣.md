    【This Newspaper, Yubei Front, 10th Dispatch】This newspaper reporter Ke Gang reports: The People's Liberation Army "Nenjiang" troops' long-prepared battlefield heroes' conference officially opened on the 8th. The meritorious soldiers from each unit arrived at the conference in the American-made jeeps they had personally captured. As the meritorious service train, draped in red and green silk banners with large-character slogans, sped through the villages to the venue, the masses cheered along the way: "The people's heroes are the most glorious," "The people's heroes are the people's happiness." When the meritorious soldiers entered the village where the venue was located in formation, military music played and the sounds of sheng and flute were heard. The leaders of the unit had already prepared to greet them outside the village. Shouts of slogans rose, and the yangko teams danced together. As they entered the corridor of the venue, red and green paper fluttered over the heads of the meritorious soldiers. After taking their seats, the radio station broadcast music to welcome the meritorious soldiers, and the soldiers and civilians of the whole village were overjoyed. Guo Sheng'er, just eleven years old, took off his shirt, squeezed into the crowd, carefully looked at the faces of the meritorious soldiers, and turned to his elderly mother and said, "Look, look, when can I go to the front line!"
