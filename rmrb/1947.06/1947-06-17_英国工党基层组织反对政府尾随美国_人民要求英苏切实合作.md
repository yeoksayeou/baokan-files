Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. TASS reports: The magazine "New Times" recently published an editorial entitled "Britain and the Soviet Union." It criticized the British Labour government for abandoning its election platform, pursuing an unfriendly policy towards the Soviet Union, and acting as a "subordinate" of the United States. The editorial stated: This tendency of the Labour government is facing sharp opposition in the party's grassroots organizations. Due to the lessons of the Munich policy, the revival of anti-Soviet group policies and the restoration policies of reactionary forces worldwide have not aroused any enthusiasm among the British people. Therefore, the leaders of British foreign policy are forced to constantly make assurances of their desire to increase friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. However, in practice, they are pursuing policies that contradict this, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and aiding fascist and pro-fascist regimes such as Spain, Greece, and Turkey. In discussing the issue of atomic energy, the British representatives act as spokesmen for the United States, which attempts to dominate the world. On the German question, they support the special interests of British and American trusts and their "German enterprises," and are aligned with American monopoly capitalists, opposing the Soviet Union's just demands for reparations and its proposals for developing peaceful industries and democratically transforming Germany. Although Labour leaders assure the people that supporting the Truman Doctrine is the only way to save the British Empire, acting as a "helper" of American imperialism is no less dangerous than swimming gleefully among crocodiles. Even if Britain has not lost anything now, the danger of losing its world status is threatening it urgently. Regarding British-Soviet relations, the leaders of British foreign policy talked during the war about their willingness to extend the British-Soviet treaty for fifty years, but after the war, they rejected the Soviet Union's proposals to improve the treaty and remove those reservations that weakened it. At the Margate Labour Party conference, they tried to distort and slander the Soviet Union's policies in an attempt to change British public opinion that demanded British-Soviet cooperation. The editorial concluded: British-Soviet relations must be strengthened and developed on the basis of establishing lasting peace and security. This requires not verbal assurances, but practical action.

　　英国工党基层组织反对政府尾随美国
    人民要求英苏切实合作
    【新华社陕北十四日电】据塔斯社讯：新时代杂志顷以“英国与苏联”为题发表社论。抨击英工党政府背弃其竞选纲领，对苏执行不友好的政策，而充当美国的“下党”。社论略称：工党政府这一倾向在该党基层组织中，正遭受尖锐的反对。由于慕尼黑政策的教训，反苏集团政策及全世界反动势力复辟政策的复活，在英国人民中并未引起任何热心，因此英国外交政策领袖被迫不断提出增进对苏友好合作之愿望的保证。但实际上，他们却追随着与此抵触的政策，干涉他国内政，援助西班牙、希腊、土耳其等法西斯和亲法西斯政权。在讨论原子能问题时，英国代表充当着企图统治世界的美国的代言人。对于德国问题，则支持英美托辣斯及其“德国企业”的特殊利益，和美国垄断资本家结合在一起，反对苏联公正的赔偿要求和发展德国和平工业及民主改造德国的主张。虽然工党领袖们向人民保证支持杜鲁门主义是拯救大英帝国的唯一方法，但充当美帝国主义的“下手”，其危险不下于在鳄鱼群中得意忘形地游泳。即使英国现在还无所丧失，但丧失其世界地位的危险无论如何都是在紧迫的威胁着她的。关于英苏关系，英国外交政策的领袖们在战时谈论着愿意延长英苏条约期限到五十年，但战后却拒绝苏联改进条约及取消那些削弱条约之保留条件的建议。他们在马尔盖特工党大会上竭力曲解和诽谤苏联的政策，企图转变要求英苏合作的英国舆论。社论最后指出：英苏关系必须在建立持久和平与安全的基础上加强和发展，这不需要口头的保证，而需要实践。
