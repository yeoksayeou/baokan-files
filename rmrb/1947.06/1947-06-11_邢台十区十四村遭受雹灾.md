　　Xingtai Ten Districts and Fourteen Villages Suffer Hailstorm
    [This newspaper Xingtai News] The Shicao area of the Tenth District suffered a hailstorm, affecting a total of fourteen villages, with a total loss of more than 1,500 mu of wheat.
    The government is preparing to allocate a loan of 1 million yuan to be distributed through work-for-relief methods. In addition, it is also preparing to allocate some grain as a relief measure. Currently, the mood of the masses has turned to actively demanding production, stepping up the work of harvesting wheat fields, carrying water and planting seeds. (Chang Yan)
