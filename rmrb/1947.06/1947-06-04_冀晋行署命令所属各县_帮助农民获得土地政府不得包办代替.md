Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st. The Ji-Jin Administrative Office has ordered all subordinate counties to thoroughly help farmers solve the land problem. The order pointed out: "If problems arise during the land re-investigation, the opinions of the masses should be listened to and resolved by the masses themselves. The government must not take over and do it for them. Governments and cadres at all levels must not accept complaints or grievances from landlords, and should hand them over to the masses for resolution. In newly liberated areas, the government must stand up for the people and resolutely suppress the masterminds who are 'reversing the accounts' during the farmers' re-investigation."

    【新华社晋察冀一日电】冀晋行署命令所属各县，彻底帮助农民解决土地问题。命令指出：“土地复查中发生问题，应听取群众意见，经过群众自己去解决，政府不得包办代替。各级政府及干部不得接收地主之控告与诉苦，应交群众去解决。在新解放区，政府要给人民作主，坚决镇压向农民复查‘倒算’的祸首”。
