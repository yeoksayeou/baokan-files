Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Shanghai newspapers report: The rice-snatching wave in the KMT-controlled areas continues to spread. In Hefei, Anhui, starving people have been seizing rice every day since May. On the 17th of last month, more than 4,000 dan of rice were being escorted out of the area by armed guards. Starving people in the vicinity, upon hearing the news, immediately gathered more than 50,000 people and rushed to the wharf to seize the rice. The soldiers escorting the rice on the ship opened fire on the unarmed starving people, killing three and seriously wounding six. Five people were arrested. In Wuhu and Gaoxiang, more than 10,000 starving people have formed rice-snatching teams and are seizing rice everywhere. In Chengdu, Sichuan, starving people have launched a "eat the rich" movement, not only seizing rice but also eating for free in restaurants. The local KMT government authorities have issued an order to "kill on sight without pardon" starving people who seize rice. More than ten people have been shot dead arbitrarily in recent days; on the 5th of last month alone, as many as 100 starving people were arrested. However, the rice-snatching wave has spread to the counties near Chengdu, which has seriously threatened Chengdu's rice supply, and most rice shops remain closed. Also, the rice-snatching wave in Songjiang, Jiangsu, is expanding and spreading.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. The tea industry, one of China's two major export commodities, has suffered a serious crisis under the monopoly and destruction of the four major families' bureaucratic capital. According to estimates by the Chiang-controlled Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction: tea production in various places this year is less than half of last year's; although the market price is lower than the cost, Zhejiang's tea factories have not yet purchased new tea due to stagnant sales, and millions of tea farmers are on the verge of desperation. The foreign market has been almost completely lost. According to the American tea industry, many Chinese teas have been returned this year due to their deteriorating quality. It is also said that 80 percent of the total annual consumption in the United States (about 60 million pounds) is now imported from India and Ceylon, while Chinese tea imports account for no more than 20 percent. The Soviet Union and North African markets are on the verge of collapse. Of the original 80 tea firms in Shanghai, only 20 are still in business. One tea merchant said: It will take more than ten or twenty years to restore tea production.

　　蒋区农民反饥饿斗争益烈
    合肥五万饥民抢米
    芜湖成都等地抢米风潮扩大
    【新华社陕北十一日电】沪报载：蒋管区抢米风潮继续蔓延。安徽合肥自五月以来每日均有饥民抢米，上月十七日有食米四千余担武装押运出境，附近饥民闻讯，顷刻集合五万余人，涌向码头抢米，船上押运士兵竟向徒手饥民开枪，惨杀三人，重伤六人，被捕者五人。芜湖与皋乡万余饥民已组成抢米队，到处抢米。四川成都饥民展开“吃大户运动”，抢米之外，更进入饭店白吃。该地蒋政府当局竟通令对抢米饥民“准由军警格杀勿论”。日来被随意枪杀者已在十人以上；仅上月五日一天之内，被捕饥民即达百人。但抢米风潮且已蔓延至成都附近各县，因此成都米源更受严重威胁，米店仍多未开门。又江苏松江抢米风潮也在扩大蔓延中。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】中国两大对外输出品之一的茶业，在四大家族官僚资本垄断摧残下，已遭受严重危机。据蒋记浙省建设厅估计：本年各地茶产不及去年半数；市价虽低于成本，但因销路停滞，浙江全省茶厂至今尚未收购新茶，数百万茶农濒于绝境。国外市场则已丧失殆尽，据美茶业界称：因华茶品质每况愈下，今年被退回者甚多。并称：美全年销费量（约六千万磅）百分之八十现俱由印度及锡兰输入，而华茶输入最多不过百分之二十而已。苏联及北非市场则临近断绝。上海原有八十余家茶行，现开业者仅二十家。某茶商称：欲求茶业产量之恢复，已非十年二十年不能。
