Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 23rd: The Yan'an occupied by Hu Zongnan's bandits is not peaceful. One night in April, many of Hu's soldiers guarding the airport on the eastern outskirts of Yan'an, an area riddled with enemy military police and bunkers, were killed. Since then, the enemy has been suffering from headaches at night. They feel that the short summer nights seem even longer than the cold winter nights. But the daytime is as unfavorable to them as the night. One day in April, a car carrying military pay, leaving Yan'an City and heading east, was blown up by guerrillas emerging from a ditch just after passing the airport. The great victory at Panlong on May 4th especially severely shocked the bandits entrenched in Yan'an. On May 8th, a major disturbance broke out in the city, and the bandits chaotically concentrated to the south. The enemy's "Hu Zongnan Headquarters Guerrilla Detachment" stationed in Gaoqiao Town, west of Yan'an, fled into Yan'an City overnight. The bandits in Yangjialing in the northern suburbs withdrew to outside the South Gate, and those outside the South Gate withdrew to Qilipu in the southern suburbs, preparing to flee. However, news came from 30 li to the south that "powerful Eighth Route Army" had been discovered at Ershilipu and Sanshilipu, the car had been destroyed, and the tanks had fled back. The bandits were even more chaotic. Hu Zongnan issued a "Good Citizen Certificate" to every citizen of Yan'an who had not fled. Without a "Good Citizen Certificate," one could not enter Yan'an. However, the citizens secretly sent the "Good Citizen Certificates" to the guerrillas. As a result, slogans and leaflets of the democratic government guerrillas frequently appeared on the walls of the city. The bandits panicked and spread rumors everywhere, saying that a pistol was found on a walking woman... and the enemy became frightened. Inspection stations were set up at Wenhua Gou outside the North Gate and Nanguan, strictly inspecting passing pedestrians. The pseudo-county government recalled the old "Good Citizen Certificates" and re-measured the citizens with a thread from elbow to wrist, registering the length on the new "Identity Card," and verifying whether the length of the elbow and wrist matched with the thread during inspection. They also used iron wire to isolate the traffic inside and outside the city, and residents outside the suburbs were not allowed to enter the city. However, no matter what, the sound of gunfire in the suburbs still penetrated the obstacles such as iron wire into the city from time to time. This sound encouraged the people in the city's confidence in victory, telling them that the people's armed forces were in the suburbs, and would soon return to Yan'an.

　　胡匪在延安日夜惊慌
    市内经常出现民主政府标语
    城郊枪声鼓舞人民胜利信心
    【新华社西北二十三日电】胡宗南匪徒们占领下的延安是不平静的。四月一个夜晚，在敌军警林立地堡工事纵横的延安东郊飞机场上，胡军许多警卫兵被击毙了。从此敌人对黑夜感到头痛，他们觉得：短促的夏夜，似乎比隆冬的寒夜还要漫长。但是白昼也和夜晚一样对他们不利。四月某日，一辆装着军饷离开延市向东驶去的汽车，刚驶过飞机场，便被沟里钻出的游击队用手榴弹炸毁了。五月四日蟠龙大捷，尤其严重的震撼了盘踞在延安的匪徒们。五月八日，城里起了大的动乱，匪徒们乱烘烘的向南集中。驻在延市西郊外高桥镇的敌人“胡宗南长官部游击支队”，连夜仓惶逃进了延市，北郊杨家岭的匪徒撤到南门外，南门外的撤到南郊外的七里铺，他们准备着逃走。可是从南面卅里又传来消息说：廿里铺、三十里铺都发现“强大八路”，汽车被击毁，坦克逃了回来、匪徒们更乱了。延安未逃走的市民，胡宗南每人都发给一个“良民证”，没有“良民证”不能进延安。但市民们纷纷把“良民证”偷送给游击队。于是市内墙壁上，民主政府游击队的标语和传单经常出现了。匪徒们惊惶失措的到处传播着，说什么在一个行走的女人身上也发现了手枪，…于是敌人恐惧起来了。北门外文化沟及南关等地，纷纷设立了检查站，严密的检查着过往行人。伪县政府收回了旧的“良民证”，重新用线量过市民，从肘到腕的长短，登记在新的“身份证”上，检验时用线再量肘腕长短是否相合。又用铁丝等把市内外交通隔绝开来，郊外居民不许进入市内。但是不管怎样，市郊的枪声仍不时透过铁丝等障碍物传入市内。这种声音，鼓舞着市内人民的胜利信心，告诉他们，人民的武装就在郊外，而且不久将来就要重回延安的。
