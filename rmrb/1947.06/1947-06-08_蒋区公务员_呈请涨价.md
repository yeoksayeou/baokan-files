Public Servants in Chiang's Area
　　Petition for a Raise
　　Ma Fantuo
　　Investigating the salaries of our positions,
　　They are inherently meager and pitiable.
　　Recently, prices have fluctuated,
　　Making the value of people even cheaper.

　　The last time public utilities,
　　Such as postal services, telecommunications, transportation, and coal,
　　Increased several times over,
　　Had already been implemented.

　　At that time, you indicated,
　　That the salaries of public education personnel in our positions,
　　Would also be adjusted,
　　Adding a thousand times plus two hundred thousand.

　　Who would have thought it was just empty words of comfort,
　　Forgotten as soon as they were spoken,
　　While high prices are a reality,
　　Salary increases are still being discussed in meetings.

　　The losses for us are not small,
　　Related to your credibility,
　　So-called reputation is important,
　　How can prestige be damaged?

　　Gold prices went to three hundred thousand,
　　Coal balls sell for twenty thousand,
　　Our family members are not clever housewives,
　　It's hard to cook rice from uncooked grains.

　　Everything is increasing in price,
　　Only salaries are falling,
　　Therefore, we petition for a raise,
　　Discounts cannot be given again.

　　Continuous inflation,
　　Is equivalent to an invisible tax,
　　Skinning, tendon-extracting, and oil-squeezing,
　　How ruthless are you?

　　We make a special plea, weeping and stating,
　　Tears and snot coming together,
　　We are turning into hungry ghosts,
　　Is that what you desire?

　　We humbly request approval for a raise,
　　Congratulations on your fortune,
　　The military doesn't die and the civil official gets promoted,
　　Ten thousand taxes! Ten thousand taxes! Ten thousand taxes!

　　蒋区公务员
    呈请涨价
    马凡陀
    窃查职等薪水，
    本属微薄可怜。
    迩来物价波动，
    人价益见低廉。
　
    上次公用事业，
    邮电交通煤炭，
    以致上涨数倍，
    业经实行在案。
　
    当时钧座表示，
    职等公教人员，
    亦将调整薪水，
    千倍再加廿万。
　
    孰意空言安慰，
    说过也就忘怀，
    物价高涨是实，
    加薪尚在开会。
　
    职等吃亏非小，
    钧座信用有关，
    所谓名誉要紧，
    威信岂可破坏。
　
    金价卅万出关，
    煤球卖到两万，
    职眷既非巧妇，
    生米难煮熟饭。
　
    样样东西涨价，
    只有薪水跌价，
    为此呈请照加，
    折扣不可再打。
　
    通货膨胀不休，
    等于无形税收，
    剥皮抽筋熬油，
    钧座何其辣手？
　
    用特哀告泣陈，
    眼泪鼻涕齐来，
    职等变成饿鬼，
    岂是钧座所快？
　
    伏祈准予涨价，
    恭喜钧座发财，
    武的不死文加官，
    万税！万税！万税！
        （文联四四四）
