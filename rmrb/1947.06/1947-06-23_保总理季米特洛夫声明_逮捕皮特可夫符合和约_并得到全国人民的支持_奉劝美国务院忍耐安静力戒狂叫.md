Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—TASS, Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov recently issued a statement to the press, stating in brief: On June 11th, the U.S. State Department issued a statement regarding the arrest of Petkov; unfortunately, the U.S. State Department, like certain foreign individuals, is attempting to influence the court's disposition, or use it to achieve special purposes. As for the U.S. State Department's assertion that we have violated the Yalta Declaration, the Armistice Terms, and particularly Article 2 of the treaty we signed, I, in my capacity as Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bulgaria, must explicitly declare that the Bulgarian government is striving to correctly implement the spirit of the Yalta Declaration, strictly fulfill the Armistice Terms, and steadfastly abide by the treaty. However, as is well known, the treaty, in addition to Article 2, also contains Article 4: In accordance with the Armistice Agreement, Bulgaria shall take measures to dissolve fascist-type organizations, political, military, semi-military, and all other organizations engaged in hostile propaganda against the United Nations. Bulgaria has the obligation to prevent the existence of groups attempting to seize the rights of the people's democracy. The case of Petkov falls into this category. The Bulgarian government has the right to hope that all those who express alarm about Petkov's fate will show the necessary patience and quiet, and wait for the verdict of the Bulgarian Supreme Court, and refrain from actions that will only increase the difficulty in establishing the necessary normal and friendly relations between Bulgaria and the United States, a relationship that the Bulgarian people and government sincerely desire.

Dimitrov also pointed out in his statement: After the Bulgarian government arrested Petkov, it received the support of the entire nation, without even the slightest protest. This disappointed Petkov's domestic and foreign friends and some short-sighted people, because they originally thought this event would cause chaos in Bulgaria.

　　保总理季米特洛夫声明
    逮捕皮特可夫符合和约
    并得到全国人民的支持
    奉劝美国务院忍耐安静力戒狂叫
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保总理季米特洛夫顷向报界发表声明略称：六月十一日美国国务院发表了关于皮特可夫被逮捕之声明；不幸得很，美国国务院和其他的某些国外人士一样企图来影响法庭的处置，或者利用它来达到特殊目的。就美国国务院所断言我们违反了雅尔塔宣言、停战条款、特别是我们所签字的和约第二条而言，我以保加利亚人民共和国总理的资格必须明确的宣告：保国政府正在力谋正确的依据雅尔塔宣言的精神，严格的履行停战条款及遵守和约不渝。但是众所周知，和约除第二条外，还载有第四条款：遵照停战协定，保国采取措施解散法西斯类型的团体，政治的、军事的、半军事的以及所有其他从事对联合国进行敌意宣传的团体，保国有义务去防止那一类企图夺取人民民主权利的团体的存在。皮特可夫的案件就属于这一类性质。保国政府有权希望所有那些对于皮特可夫的命运表示惊惧的人们一定要显示出必需的忍耐与安静，一定要等待保国最高法院的宣判，而力戒有那样的行动，那样的行动只能对保美间必需的正常和友谊关系的建立增加困难，而这种关系是保国人民同政府所诚恳愿望的。
    季氏并在声明中指出：保国政府逮捕皮特可夫后，得到全国人民的支持，甚至极轻微的抗议都没有，这使得皮特可夫的那些国内外朋友和某些短见的人陷于失望，因为他意原以为这个事件是会引起保国混乱的。
