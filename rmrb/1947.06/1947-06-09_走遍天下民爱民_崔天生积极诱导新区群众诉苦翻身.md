　　Walking the World, Loving the People
    Cui Tiansheng Actively Guides the Masses in New Areas to Speak Out About Their Suffering and Overthrow Their Oppressors
    [Report from Cixian by Our Newspaper] Under the slogan of "Carrying Stretchers, Walking the World, Loving the People," stretcher bearers in Cixian County are actively helping the masses in the new areas to get their lives going, and while doing so, inspiring them to speak out about their suffering and overthrow their oppressors. Cui Tiansheng and others are typical examples. Cui Tiansheng is a member of the First Squad of the Third District in Cixian County. His past life made him aware of the suffering of the poor who had no food or shelter, so he cared even more for these poor brothers. In order to understand the situation in the new areas and help them to turn things around, he took the initiative to go to the villages and find the masses to work with, in order to get close to them. At first, the masses did not approach him. After a period of working, and after building three new houses for the villagers who had no place to live, the relationship with the masses gradually improved. Especially those who he had helped build houses with, became like family with him, telling him everything, without keeping secrets from each other. He successively hoed five mu of cotton for Wang Shizi and others stationed in the village, and cleared nine mu of weeds, making the relationship with the masses even more harmonious. More and more people came to him every day to ask him to work for them. At this time, Cui Tiansheng promoted the policies of the democratic government, told stories of the impoverished people in the old liberated areas who had turned things around, and the listeners were deeply moved. Then, when he talked about the cruelty of the local bullies and landlords towards the poor, before he could finish speaking, an old villager interjected, saying: "I know all too well. Back when the landlord Song Jingming was the village head, we suffered greatly from him. Especially Wang Shizi in our village, who was almost beaten to death by him." At this point, he was very angry and his attitude was unusual. Cui Tiansheng enlightened him, saying: "You have such great suffering, why don't you unite the poor and fight against him? The Eighth Route Army came to help the poor turn things around! If you have grievances, avenge them, if you have injustice, right it, why don't you do it?" "They have already run away!" the old villager said. "The people may have run away, but the land can't run away! Settle accounts with him and distribute the property and land he stole from the poor," Cui Tiansheng continued. Instantly, the villagers were reminded.
    On the same day (the 26th), Comrade Song Yuchun, a district cadre from the Cixian County Stretcher Team, was working for Wang Shizi and also talked about turning things around and speaking out about suffering. Wang Shizi then told about his suffering. He said angrily: "In the past, Song Jingming's family were bandits and robbed one of my relatives. I spoke up for them, and Song Jingming came looking for me with a gun in the dark. Fortunately, I was not there, or I would have been killed by that dog ＠ with a gun!" He continued, "I must settle accounts with that dog ＠!" Comrade Song Yuchun encouraged him, saying: "As long as you can connect with the poor, you can vent this anger, as long as you do it!" Wang Shizi was overjoyed and wanted to become sworn brothers with Comrade Song Yuchun, asking him to help him vent his anger. He also heard the villagers talking about turning things around, so he went to them that night. Several people went to the Second Regiment that night to discuss settling accounts with the local bully Song Jingming, and decided to go down separately to connect with the people and immediately organize the masses to do it while the iron was hot. The next day, within a day, forty-one households were organized to join the peasant association, and they established their own organization and launched a liquidation against the local bully Song Jingming. How did Song Jingming become rich? It turned out that his ancestors were bandits, and later they also ran the industry line, robbing and exploiting the good people. He served as a puppet village chief in the past, embezzling and filling his own pockets, and accumulating wealth by scraping the fat off the masses. The masses rose up with the help of Cui Tiansheng and others from the Cixian stretcher. They unanimously demanded that the things he had plundered from the masses over the years be distributed to the masses. Now the masses in the village have received 120 mu of land, which has been distributed to 41 poor farmers who have little or no land. They are now preparing to harvest wheat. Cui Tiansheng has become one with the masses, and he pulls them to work and talk to them on the street. When someone asked him why he was so good, Cui Tiansheng replied: "It is not because I am good, it is because Chairman Mao leads well. I have turned things around, and I should also help my poor brothers to live a good life!" (Jing Yu, De Yuan)

　　走遍天下民爱民
    崔天生积极诱导新区群众诉苦翻身
    【本报磁县讯】磁县担架员在“抬担架走遍天下民爱民”的口号下，积极帮助新区群众做活，做活中启发群众诉苦翻身。崔天生等就是典型。崔天生是磁县三区一中队的队员，他过去的生活使他知道穷人没吃没住的苦处，因之对这些穷弟兄更为关怀，为了了解新区情况，帮助他们翻身，他主动的到村就找群众去做活，来接近群众，开始群众不接近他，做了一段活，给驻村无房住的盖起三间新房子后，群众关系逐渐好起来，尤其是他帮盖过屋的人，和他就成了一家，无啥不说，彼此不分，接连给驻村王石子等锄花五亩，刨草九亩，给群众关系更为融洽，每天找他们做活的便多起来了。崔天生在这时便宣传民主政府的政策，谈老解放区的贫苦人们的翻身故事，听者颇受感动，继谈到恶霸地主苛薄穷人事，不容说完，一个老乡就插上嘴说：“我可知道，过去俺村地主宋晶铭当保长时，受他苦楚可大啦，尤其是俺村王石子，几乎被他打死。”他这时非常愤恨，态度异常，崔天生启发的说：“你们有这样大的苦，为啥不将穷人联合起来给他干，斗争他呢？八路军来就是帮助穷人翻身的呀！有仇就报仇，有冤报冤，怎不干？”“他们人已跑了！”老乡这样说。“人跑了地跑不了呀！给他清算，分他剥削穷人的财产地。”崔天生接着这样说。顿时老乡们被提醒了。
    当天（二十六日），磁县担架队区干宋玉春同志给王石子做活，亦谈起翻身诉苦事，王石子便诉起他的苦楚来了，他愤恨的说：“过去宋晶铭家当土匪，抢了我个亲戚，我抱不平，在旁说了两句，黑夜宋晶铭带着枪去找我了，幸亏我未在，免了祸，要不是就被狗＠的用枪打死啦！”接着说：“非给狗＠的算算账不行！”宋玉春同志鼓励的说：“只要你能串连穷人，这个气就能出，只要你干！”这下王石子喜坏了，他非给宋玉春同志拜朋友不行，要叫帮他出气，又听到村里老乡在谈着翻身事，晚上便去找他们了，黑夜几个人便到二团去商量向恶霸宋晶铭清算，决定分头下去串通，趁热组织起群众马上就干。第二天，一天内就组织起四十一户入了农会，成立了自己的组织，便向宋晶铭恶霸展开了清算。宋晶铭是怎样发家的呢？原来他上辈当土匪，后又包办产业行，抢夺剥削善良的老百姓，他前年任伪保长，贪污中饱，刮的群众脂膏起了家，群众在磁县担架崔天生等帮助下起来了，一致要求把他历年剥夺群众的东西分配给群众，现在该村群众已得到一百二十亩地，共分配给四十一户无地少地的贫苦农民，现他们正在准备割麦。崔天生已和群众打成一片，到街就给群众拉去做活、谈话。有人问他怎么这么好，崔天生答道：“不是我好，是毛主席领导的好，我翻了身，俺也该带助穷兄弟过好光景哩！”（静宇、德元）
