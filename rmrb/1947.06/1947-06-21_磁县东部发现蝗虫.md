　　Locusts Discovered in Eastern Ci County
    [Report from this newspaper, Ci County] A large number of locusts have been found emerging from the soil in eastern Ci County. There are both winged locusts and nymphs. The locust nymphs are very dense; one slap can kill seven or eight. In some villages, some autumn seedlings have already been damaged. The second and third districts are organizing all forces to eliminate them. Initially, some of the masses were superstitious and afraid to fight them. After Wu, the district head of the third district, discovered this, he personally participated in organizing the masses to fight. During the locust fighting, he promoted the old liberated area's locust control experience from 1943. Four hundred people eliminated locusts on twenty mu of land in one day. After seeing that the locusts could be eliminated, the masses broke their superstition and said that listening to the government was the right thing to do. District Head Wu called on all villages to scout and eliminate locusts wherever they were found. Each village organized a locust eradication headquarters, and once discovered, they would carry out the elimination.

　　磁县东部发现蝗虫
    【本报磁县讯】磁县东部，发现大批蝗虫出土，蝗虫有飞蝗，有蝻子，蝗蝻很密，一掌可以打七、八个，个别村部分秋苗已被吃坏。二、三两区正组织一切力量歼灭。开始群众有些迷信不敢打，三区武区长发觉后，便亲自参加组织群众去打，在打蝗中，宣传四三年老区打蝗经验，四百人一天即消灭蝗地廿亩。群众看到蝗虫可以被歼后，便打破了迷信，并说听政府话就对。武区长号召各村放侦察，那有就去那消灭，各村组织剿蝗指挥部，一旦发现即进行歼灭。
