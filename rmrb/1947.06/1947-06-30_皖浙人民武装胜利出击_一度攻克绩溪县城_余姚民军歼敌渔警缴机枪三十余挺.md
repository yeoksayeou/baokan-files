Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: According to reports from Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao and other sources: The people's armed forces in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces launched victorious offensives in May, shaking Jiangnan with their might. (1) In the Siming Mountains of Zhejiang Province, over 500 militiamen from Yuyao surrounded the Jiang's fishery police force commanded by Zhang Ya-liu stationed in Ningbo and Shengshan on May 14th. During a desperate breakout, Zhang's force had over 200 rifles and over 30 machine guns seized by the militia; the company commander Sun Hou-san and over 20 others were killed or wounded; Zhang Ya-liu suffered severe injuries to his abdomen and left hand. Zhang, whose formal name is Zhang Zhibang, with "Ya-liu" being his childhood name, was originally a Chongming pirate. Later, the Jiang government incorporated him into the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army." He colluded with the enemy puppets during the occupation. After the victory, he served as Deputy Commander of the 18th Traffic Police Corps and Major General Commissioner. (2) The militias of Lao Hu, Lao Guo, and Lao Yuan, active in the Huangshan and Tianmu Mountains area of Anhui Province on both sides of the Jing-She Railway, launched a three-pronged attack on the morning of May 20th, capturing Jixi County seat on the railway line in one fell swoop, taking more than a dozen Jiang's police as prisoners and killing or wounding some; seizing 38 rifles and pistols, and some documents. They later voluntarily withdrew from the city. (3) On May 30th, seven militia units joined forces at Naomen Ridge, 20 miles northeast of Taiping, Anhui Province, and ambushed and completely annihilated a detachment of the Jiang's self-defense force of the county, killing, wounding, and capturing over 30 people, and seizing one machine gun and over 30 rifles and pistols. It is reported that the Jiang government's military strength in Jiangnan is extremely weak. For example, Jixi County seat only has thirty to forty police officers who are underfed and poorly clothed. The victory of the militia made Jiang's officials panic. After Jixi was captured, the commissioner of the area wailed in his "Letter to the Local Elders," saying, "National defense troops have been transferred elsewhere one after another, defenses are empty, and public security is worrying." He also said, "If no measures are taken, local order will be impossible to maintain."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: According to a compilation of Shanghai newspaper reports: The anti-"encirclement and suppression" war of the people's armed forces in Jiangnan from January to May has been winning victories, and Jiang's army has been failing everywhere. According to incomplete statistics: In various counties of southern Anhui and southern Jiangsu, a total of more than 400 Jiang's soldiers were killed, wounded, or captured in five months, and two machine guns and more than 300 rifles and pistols were seized, in addition to more than 50 being destroyed. More than 20 Jiang's district public offices in Taiping, Shitai, Fanchang, Qingyang and other counties of Anhui Province were destroyed. They fought successively with the Jiang's Anhui Security 4th Regiment, Security 2nd Regiment, and other local reactionary armed forces of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces at Maolin Town, Zhangjiadu, and Chitan in Jing County, Anhui Province; Dunji Road, Songde, Jiangcun, Suncun, Licun, and Xikeng in Ningguo; Yangxi and Fuling in Jixi; Pangjia Street in Wujin, Jiangsu Province, and Dongyuebu in Yixing. After Jiang's troops were severely attacked by the militia, they collapsed and retreated. The Security 4th Regiment has been forced to withdraw completely from Jixi, and the Security 3rd Regiment does not dare to settle in Jing County, instead stationing itself in small outposts in the periphery to prevent militia attacks.

　　皖浙人民武装胜利出击
    一度攻克绩溪县城
    余姚民军歼敌渔警缴机枪三十余挺
    【新华社陕北廿七日电】据沪大公报等透露：浙皖两省人民武装五月间出击大胜，声威震动江南。（一）浙省四明山区余姚民军五百余人，五月十四日包围盘踞于宁波、嵊山之蒋记渔业警察队张鸭六部。张部于慌忙突围中，被民军缴获步枪二百余支，机枪三十余挺；毙伤中队长孙厚三以下二十余名，张鸭六腹部及左手重伤。张名治邦，“鸭六”为其乳名，原为崇明海盗，后蒋政府收编为“忠义救国军”，与敌伪勾搭，胜利后曾任交通警察第十八总队副队长及少将专员等职。（二）活动于京歙铁路两侧皖境黄山、天目山一带之民军老胡、老郭、老袁等三部，于五月二十日晨三路出击，一举攻克铁路线上之绩溪县城，生俘蒋记保警十余名，毙伤一部；缴获长短枪三十八支，文件一部。后自动撤离该城。（三）五月三十日民军七部联合于皖省太平东北二十里之闹门岭设伏，全歼该县蒋记自卫队一个分队，计毙伤俘三十余名，缴机枪一挺，长短枪三十余支。据悉：蒋政府在江南之兵力极为薄弱，如绩溪县城仅有食不果腹，衣不蔽体之保警三四十名。民军之胜利，使蒋记官吏忧惶万状。当绩溪被攻入后，该区专员在其“告地方父老书”中哀号：“国防部队相继他调，防务空虚，治安堪虑。”并说：“再不设法，地方秩序亦将无法维持。”
    【新华社华中二十七日电】综合沪报消息：江南人民武装一至五月反“清剿”战争，节节胜利，蒋军处处失败。据不完全统计：皖南及苏南各县，五个月共毙伤俘蒋军四百余人，缴机枪两挺，长短枪三百余支，另烧毁五十余支。摧毁皖省之太平，石埭、繁昌、青阳等县蒋记区公所二十余所。与蒋记安徽保安第四总队、保安第二总队及苏皖两省其他地方反动武装先后作战于皖省泾县之茂林镇、章家渡、赤滩，宁国之墩甲路、松德、江村、孙村、礼村、西坑；绩溪之杨溪、伏岭；苏省武进之庞家街，宜兴之东岳埠等地。蒋记部队遭民军痛击后，纷纷溃退。保安第四总队已被迫全部撤离绩溪，保安第三总队亦不敢安驻泾县城内，而分驻外围小据点，以防民军袭击。
