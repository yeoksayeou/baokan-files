Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to TASS, New York, the public and newspapers continue to discuss the "new route" of American foreign policy due to Truman's signing of the "Aid to Turkey and Greece" bill. They point out that the "Aid to Turkey and Greece" bill is only the first step, and similar measures will continue to follow for China, Korea, France, etc. They even mentioned the planned total amount of "aid" (10 billion to 50 billion yuan). The debate on this bill in Congress was protracted, and although it was finally passed by both houses, the process of discussion showed that the bill fundamentally did not satisfy either the liberals or the conservatives in Congress. For example, some members of Congress said that the Truman Doctrine would weaken the policy of international cooperation and have a negative impact on the latter; even the reactionaries in Congress believed that the Truman Doctrine was self-contradictory and not recommendable. Most members of Congress voted in favor of the bill simply because they feared that if the bill was rejected, it would be like passing a vote of no confidence in the government, thereby weakening the United States' position internationally. Reactionary Senator Taft frankly declared on the eve of the vote: he would vote in favor of the bill simply to avoid harming the president's prestige. At the same time, many members of Congress emphasized that approving this bill does not mean approving the entire Truman Doctrine. Another reactionary Senator Vandenberg said that he was only voting in favor of this bill, not the entire Truman Doctrine. Stassen also expressed disagreement with the purpose of this doctrine. American newspapers, in describing the worsening economic situation in Europe and Asia, and simultaneously the growth of democratic movements within those countries, have begun to conclude that America's new foreign policy, as it has been applied to China, Greece, and Turkey, cannot guarantee the economic stability of those countries, nor can it guarantee their political stability, but rather deepens the crises in those countries, while also hindering the United States from fighting its own impending recession.

　　美以“援助”进行扩张
    必将害人而又害己
    【新华社陕北五日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：由于杜鲁门签署“援助”土希法案，舆论界与报纸继续讨论美国外交政策“新路线”。他们指出“援助”土希法案只算是第一步，对于中国、朝鲜、法国等将继续有同样的措施跟踪而来。他们甚至提到计划中的“援助”总额（百亿至五百亿元）。这个法案在国会里的辩论是拖延了的，虽然最后他被两院通过了，但讨论的进程表示出根本上法案既没有满足国会中的自由派，也没有满足国会中的保守派。例如某些国会议员说杜鲁门主义会削弱国际合作的政策，并给后者以不良影响；甚至国会里的反动派也认为杜鲁门主义是自相矛盾的，并非建议性的。大多数的国会议员投票赞成法案，只是他们恐怕如果法案被否决了，就如同通过对政府不信任案一样，因而削弱了美国在国际间的地位。反动的参议员塔虎脱在投票前夕坦白的宣称：他要投票赞同法案只是为了不损害总统的声望。同时很多国会议员都着重说：批准这个法案并不等于批准整个杜鲁门主义。另一个反动参议员范登堡称：他只是投票赞成这个法案，而不是赞同整个杜鲁门主义。史塔生也表示不同意这个主义的目的。美国报纸叙述欧洲同亚洲经济情势的愈趋恶化与同时那些国家内民主运动的生长，已经开始这样的论断：美国的新外交政策，如已运用于中国、希腊、土耳其的，是既不能保证那些国家的经济稳定，又不能保证其政治的稳定，而是加深了那些国家的危机，同时还妨碍着美国和自己行将到来的不景气作斗争。
