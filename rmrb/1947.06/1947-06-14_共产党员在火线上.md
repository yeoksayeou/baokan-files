Communist Party Members on the Front Lines
    Ke Gang
    Walking into the war zone office of the Party Committee Secretary of the Sixth and Fourth Troops, I saw a statistical chart composed of only one line that rises daily. This marks the number of soldiers on the front lines requesting to join the Communist Party during the self-defense war. The Party Committee Secretary told me that after each battle, at least two hundred soldiers' applications to join the Party are sent here; some who verbally expressed their requests before sacrificing themselves but didn't have time to write them down are not yet included in the chart. With the permission of the Secretary, I browsed through a portion of the applications being reviewed. Most of them wrote something like this: "I admire the heroic, fearless spirit of the Communist Party members, and I feel that it is infinitely glorious. For my own liberation and for the liberation of all the poor people in the world, I am willing to fight to the end against Chiang Kai-shek and all reactionaries, regardless of any sacrifice, just like them. Please review and approve my application to join the Communist Party."

    Some are applications from liberated soldiers, who almost all first solemnly declare their "separation from the Kuomintang" or "Comrades Association" and then sincerely request to join the Communist Party. Yao Jian, who came from the Ping-Han Campaign, wrote in his application: "I have never seen people as resolute, brave, and sincerely dedicated to serving the people as the Communist Party members. I solemnly declare my firm departure from the Kuomintang, which speaks human language but does not do human affairs, and swear to fight to the end for myself and for the people of the world. Please approve my application to join the Communist Party." Chen Xianbin, who came from the Shangdang Campaign, wrote: "I was deceived by Yan Xishan before and joined his 'Comrades Association.' Now I am determined to leave him and join the Communist Party because the Communist Party is our own party of the working people. I will fight to the end for our own revolutionary cause so I am worthy of being a human being. Please approve me for the Communist Party." Fang Wensheng, who came from the Southern Campaign and has already won three meritorious services, wrote: "I think no one in the world can be more brave and good at fighting than the Communist Party members because the Communist Party is truly the vanguard of the poor. I am one of the poor, and I request to join the Communist Party to fight to the end against the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and all the reactionaries in the world. However, I used to be in the Kuomintang, and now I swear to leave it forever..."

    Reading these applications made me think about a very real question: how exactly are the Communist Party members so bravely fighting for the people and being admired by the broad masses of non-Party soldiers who want to learn from them? Here are just a few fragments of information heard from the vast ranks of soldiers, but they are unforgettable.

    During the attack on Caiyuan, Communist Party member Zhai Chuntang was recuperating in the hospital. As soon as he heard about the battle, he set off without fully recovering from his injuries. The organization advised him not to go, but he secretly followed the assault team, crossed two lines of deer fences, and a bay, and was the first to climb the city wall. When he climbed to the top of the wall, others had not yet followed. Four enemy bayonets stabbed at him, he dodged, and a grenade knocked the enemy back. He occupied the enemy's fortifications. The enemy kept trying to retake the fortifications. He repelled the enemy several times. Finally, he was injured by a grenade. The enemy rushed to capture him. Despite his injuries, he killed three more enemies. Only then did the troops behind him catch up. In the Battle of Huocun, the enemy used intense artillery fire to cover their infantry, launching a fierce counterattack against us. Many fortifications were destroyed, and some people tried to move their positions. He said, "No, it is most disgraceful for the Communist Party's army to lose its position." He stood up from the fortifications and shouted loudly, "Don't be afraid, aim and fire, the enemy is afraid of death." Just then, a shell landed in front of him, he fell down, but immediately stood up again, still shouting the same thing, "Aim and fire, the enemy is afraid of death." Indeed, the enemy was afraid of death. When the ground in front of our position was covered with enemy corpses, the enemy dared not counterattack again. But then another shell landed beside Comrade Zhai Chuntang. He fell down again, falling on his original position. He didn't get up. Lying on the stretcher, he still said: "Communist Party members must not lose their positions, aim and fire, the enemy is afraid of death."

    Speaking of Communist Party member Wang Wenkuan, not a single person in the Third Company didn't admire him wholeheartedly. In the Battle of Baiqishan, after he led the charge against the enemy, the higher-ups ordered them to retreat due to unfavorable terrain. At this time, a large number of enemies pounced on them, and the situation was very tense. Some people panicked, so he stepped forward and announced to everyone: "We must retreat in an orderly manner. I am a Communist Party member, and I will cover you from behind. As long as everyone is calm, I will be responsible for any losses." No one was injured in this retreat. Not long ago, in the attack on Huocun, his arm was broken, and the bone was exposed. Under such circumstances, when he saw another comrade shouting, he said very kindly to him: "Bear with it, comrade, serving the people requires bloodshed!" As he spoke, he put a towel in his mouth and bit down on it, sweat pouring from his head, without saying a word, until the doctor tied the rope for him.

    Ge Kaiwu, a new soldier who was liberated in the company, said: "In the Jixian battle, an enemy battalion, under the cover of howitzers, attacked our company and gradually approached the regimental command post. At the time, I thought it was hopeless. Based on my combat experience in Chiang's army, our company was bound to collapse. But no one expected that our Instructor Dong would raise his pistol and shout loudly: "The time has come to perform meritorious service for the people! Defend the liberated areas! Defend Chairman Mao! Quick! Communist Party members, follow me!" Then, more than a dozen comrades picked up their bayonets, jumped out of the trenches, and ran up with the instructor. I followed them too, and finally we repelled the enemy. I believe the Communist Party's army will never be defeated." I asked him what he was thinking at the time, he said: "I wasn't thinking about anything. I just felt that the enemy's bullets don't recognize people, and the Communist Party members are also for the sake of all the people in the country. They are not afraid, why shouldn't I follow them?"

    From here, I see that Communist Party members on the front lines are like magnificent giant eagles, soaring through the rain of bullets, whoever follows them will always be victorious, because only they are truly for the people.

### 共产党员在火线上

　　共产党员在火线上
    柯岗
    走进六四部队党委秘书战地办公室，在这里，我看见一张仅有一条逐日上升的直线构成的统计图表。这是自卫战争中，战士们在火线上请求参加共产党的人数标志。党委秘书告诉我，在每次战役结束之后，至少要有二百分战士们的入党申请书送到这里来；有些在牺牲之前来不及书面请求用口头提出的，尚未计入表内。得到秘书同志的许可，我翻阅了一部分正被他们审查着的入党申请书，上边大都这样写着：“我羡慕共产党员们英勇、不怕牺牲的精神，我觉得那是无限光荣。为了我自家翻身，为了全世界穷人都翻身，我愿和他们一样，不怕任何牺牲向蒋介石和一切反动派战斗到底。请党委审查，准我参加共产党。”
    有一些是被解放战士们的申请书，他们差不多都是首先严正声明“脱离国民党”或“同志会”，而又赤诚请求参加共产党的。平汉战役过来的姚建的申请书上这样写着：“我从来没有见过像共产党员这样坚决、勇敢，诚心诚意替老百姓办事的人。我声明坚决脱离那种说人话不办人事的国民党，誓死为我自己、为全世界的人民战斗到底。请党委批准我参加共产党。”上党战役过来的陈宪斌写着：“我从前上了阎锡山的当，参加了他的‘同志会’，现在我决心脱离他，参加共产党，因为共产党是我们劳动人民自己的党，我为我们自己的革命事业战斗到底，才不愧为人，请党委准许我。”从此南战役过来已经三次立功的方文胜写道：“我看世界上谁也不能比共产党员更勇敢善战了，因为共产党真正是穷苦人们的先锋，我是穷人中的一个，我要求参加共产党，向卖国贼蒋介石和全世界反动派战斗到底，可是，我从前参加过国民党，现在我誓死脱离它…………。”
    看了这些申请书，使我想到一个非常现实的问题：共产党人究竟是怎样为了人民而英勇善战，而为广大的非党的人民战士所景仰，愿意向他们学习呢？这里只随便从广大战士群中听到几个片断的材料，但是使我不能忘记的。
    打菜园的时候，共产党员翟春堂正在医院里休养，一听说打仗，伤没全好，就跟着出发了。组织上劝他不要去，他却偷偷的跟着突击组，冲过两道鹿柴，一道水湾，第一名登上城。他爬上城头时，别人尚未跟上，敌人四把刺刀向他面前刺来，他一闪身，一颗炸弹把敌人打回去。他占领了敌人的工事，敌人不停的向他争夺工事，他几次打退敌人，最后他为炸弹所伤，敌人一齐扑过来捉他，他带着伤，又打死了三个敌人。这时后边部队才跟上来。在霍村战斗中，敌人用密集炮火掩护步兵向我猛烈反扑，许多工事被摧毁，有些人企图转移阵地，他说：“不行，共产党的军队丢掉阵地是最可耻的。”他从工事里站起来，大声的喊着：“不要怕，瞄准打，敌人是怕死的。”正在这时，一颗炮弹落在他面前，他倒下去，马上又站起来，还是同样叫着：“瞄准打，敌人是怕死的。”真的，敌人是怕死的。当我们的阵地前面躺满敌人的死尸的时候，敌人再也不敢反扑了。可是这时候又一颗炮弹落在翟春堂同志的身边，他又倒下去了，倒在自己原来的阵地上，他没有爬起来，他躺在担架上还说：“共产党员是不要丢掉阵地的，瞄准打，敌人是怕死的。”
    谈到共产党员王文宽，第三连没有一个不五体投地佩服他。白奇山战斗中，当他带头向敌人冲去之后，由于地形不利，上级命令他们撤回来。这时大批敌人向他们猛扑，情况十分紧张。有些人发慌了，于是他挺身而出，向大家宣布：“要有次序的转移，我是共产党员，我在后边掩护，大家只要沉着，受损失我负责。”这次的转移没有任何人受伤。不久前打霍村，他的胳膊被打断，骨头露在外边。在这样情况下，当他看到另外一个彩号在喊叫时，他很和气的对他说：“忍耐点吧，同志，替老百姓办事，就是要流血的呀！”说着，他把手巾放在嘴里咬着，头上直冒汗，一声不响，直到医生给他把绳带捆好。
    该连被解放的新战士葛垲吾说：“在汲县战斗中，敌人一个营，在榴弹炮掩护下，向我们一个连进攻，并且一步步向团指挥所逼近。当时我看不行了，凭我在蒋军里的作战经验，我们这个连非垮台不可。可是谁也没有想到，俺董指导员把驳壳枪一举，大声说：“为人民立功的时候到了，保卫解放区、保卫毛主席，快！共产党员快跟我往前冲。”说着，有十几个同志端起刺刀，跳出战壕，跟着指导员飞跑上去，我也跟着上去了，终于打退了敌人。我相信共产党员的队伍是永远不会打败仗的。”我问他，你当时是怎么想的，他说：“我没有怎么想，我只觉得敌人的子弹是不认人的，共产党员也是为着全国老百姓，人家都不怕，我为啥不跟上去呢？”
    从这里我看到共产党员在火线上尤如雄伟的巨鹰，在枪林弹雨中翱翱，谁跟着他，谁就永远胜利，因为只有他才是真正为人民。
