　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 28th. Following the grain riot in Shenmu County, starvation riots have been continuously occurring in various counties and towns in the Shaanxi-North Jiang area, with people rising up to demand grain from landlords. On the 16th of this month, more than 300 starving people in Linghuang Town demanded grain and food from Yin Huanlang, a major landlord in Zhoujiage Village, and stated that they would take Yin away. Yin was forced to take out 40 dan of grain and distribute it to the masses. The Jiang regime's Fugu County Magistrate rushed to "lecture" them, attempting to deceive and suppress them, but failed. The starving people instead demanded exemption from grain taxes and levies. At the same time, similar events occurred in Liancheng Town, Songcui Town, and Huawu Town. The riot of more than 100 starving people in Huawu Town has been ongoing for three days since the 17th and is still developing. According to insiders, this riot was caused by the Jiang government's heavy levies and the landlords' large-scale hoarding of grain, which led to the famine. Currently, all shops in Fugu City, large and small, are closed for fear of riots by starving people.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-North, 28th. According to a recent report in the Tianjin Dagong Bao: In the Luannan County area of eastern Hebei under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, the heavy levies and miscellaneous taxes are so burdensome that even the entire income is insufficient to meet the demands, resulting in extremely cheap land with no buyers. Last month, the best land was only worth 200,000 Jiang currency per mu. The output of one mu of land for one year can buy more than two mu of land. Landowners would rather let people cultivate the land for free, without collecting rent, and issue "deeds of gift" stipulating the period of free cultivation, ranging from three years to five or seven years, in order to transfer the burden.

　　神木抢米骚动
    饥民强迫地主分粮
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】继神木县抢米骚动之后，陕北蒋区府各县各市镇近又不断发生饥民骚动，群起向地主分粮。本月十六日灵黄镇三百余饥民，向周家圪村大地主殷唤郎要粮要饭，并声言要带走殷某。殷被迫拿出粮食四十石分发群众。蒋记府谷县长闻讯赶来“训话”，企图欺骗镇压无效，饥民反进而向其要求免粮免款。同时，连成镇、松翠镇、花武镇亦发生类似事件。花武镇一百余饥民的骚动，自十七日起已持续三日，尚在发展中。据熟悉内幕者谈：此次骚动系由于蒋政府勒征苛杂与地主之大肆囤粮，致造成灾荒而起。现府谷城内大小商号，因害怕饥民骚动，均紧闭铺门。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据天津大公报近载：蒋介石统治下的冀东滦县一带，苛杂繁重，罄全部收入亦不足供应需索，以致田地奇贱，无人问津。上月上等地每亩不过蒋币二十万，一亩地一年的出产，可买两亩地而有余。有地者宁愿把地给人白种，不收地租，并写给“送契”，规定白种年限，少则三年，多至五年七年，以便转嫁负担。
