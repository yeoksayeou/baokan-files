　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 28th—With the US-made Chiang aircraft bombing and strafing the unloading docks of the Shandong Liberated Area relief supplies for days, UNRRA relief ships have used this as an excuse to sail away, which has severely disrupted the entire transport of relief supplies. On the afternoon of the 13th of this month, two Chiang aircraft bombed Yangjiaogou in Laizhou Bay, where the relief ships Wan Jing and Wan Ci were anchored awaiting unloading. On the 14th, Chiang aircraft bombed Yangjiaogou again, dropping multiple incendiary bombs. The Qingling vessel, which had just arrived at the dock, immediately turned back to Yantai without stopping. That same afternoon, Chiang aircraft intruded into Yangjiaogou again despite the rain. The Wan Ci vessel passed the Yantai dock at 1:00 PM that same afternoon. At 3:15 PM, two Chiang aircraft followed and strafed at low altitude. Relief transport truck No. 5239 had its carriage hit in four places, and the engine mount was destroyed. UNRRA distribution commissioner Duhadi narrowly escaped injury. It is reported that Shanghai has telegraphed orders to all ships docked in Yantai to immediately stop unloading and evacuate Yantai. On the evening of the 15th, the Wan Ci and Qingling vessels, along with the Wan Ce vessel which was in the process of unloading, were ordered to leave Yantai in haste. Regarding this crime of the Chiang aircraft, Li Chengzhi, director of the UNRRA Yantai office, sent a letter to the Yantai UNRRA, CNRRA, and UNRRA Tripartite Committee stating: "I received a telegram from CNRRA on May 5th, which stated: The Ministry of National Defense has designated 16 locations including Yantai, Laiyang in Jiaodong, and Yangjiaogou, Zhanhua, and Huimin in Bohai as distribution bases, and has notified the air force to protect them. But this promise has been proven completely unreliable by past and recent facts. According to the basic agreement of UNRRA's work in China, all parties must facilitate and not interfere with or restrict the loading, unloading, and transportation of UNRRA materials to China. However, the Kuomintang Air Force has continuously bombed the ports in the Shandong Liberated Area where relief supplies are being transported and unloaded. Such actions violate the agreement and destroy international relief efforts. The people in our liberated area cannot tolerate this. Therefore, I request the Tripartite Committee to jointly telegraph the UNRRA, CNRRA, and UNRRA Tripartite Committee in Shanghai to lodge a serious protest with the Chiang Kai-shek government and its Ministry of National Defense, and request UNRRA to announce its destructive behavior to the world and impose effective sanctions."

　　蒋党破坏救济工作狂炸联总运输船只
    【新华社山东二十八日电】山东解放区救济物资各卸货渡口在美造蒋机连日轰炸扫射下，联总救济船只借口驶走，已使整个救济物资的运输遭受严重破坏。本月十三日下午，蒋机二架轰炸莱州湾之羊角沟，停泊待卸之救济舰万敬、万慈二轮。十四日，蒋机复炸羊角沟，投烧夷弹多枚。刚驶抵渡口之庆龄号轮船，即未停留，急折回烟台。同日下午，蒋机又冒雨侵扰羊角沟。万慈号于同日下午一时驶过烟台渡口，三时一刻，二架蒋机尾追而至，低飞扫射，救济运输卡车五二三九号车厢被击中四处，机座穿毁。联总发放专员杜哈地险遭不测。据闻上海方面已电令泊烟各船立即停止卸货，撤离烟台。十五日晚，万慈、庆龄两轮连同正在卸货之万册号，即已奉命匆匆离烟。对蒋机此种罪行，解总烟台办事处主任李澄之特致函烟台联、行、解总三方委员会称：本人于五月五日接到行的电报，内称：国防部定胶东烟台、莱阳，勃海羊角沟、沾化、惠民等共十六处为发放基地，已通知空军保护。但这篇诺言被过去和最近事实证明其完全不可信。根据联总在华的工作基本协定联总运华物资装卸运输，各方均须予以方便，不得干涉限制，但国民党空军竟对山东解放区运送起卸救济物资之港口，先后不断轰炸，似此违反协议，破坏国际救济之罪行，我解放区人民实忍无可忍，为此函请三方委员会联名立即电告上海联、行、解总三方委员会，向蒋介石政府及其国防部提出严重抗议，并声请联总向世界宣布其破坏行为，予以有效制裁。
