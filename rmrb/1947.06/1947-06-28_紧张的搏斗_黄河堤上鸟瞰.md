Tense Struggle
    A Bird's-Eye View from the Yellow River Embankment

    I. Under Enemy Fire, Ramming Workers Display Heroism.

　　At noon on the 16th, under the scorching sun, I stood on the bank of the Yellow River, winding for hundreds of miles. I watched the turbulent Yellow River, with its muddy waves, flowing eastward. The newly built levee of the Sunkou dangerous section, under the impact of the raging waves, made sounds of collapse and splashing from time to time. The embankment of the dangerous section was crowded with people rushing to the rescue, all of whom were liberated peasants from Zhangqiu County and Shouzhang coming to help. Although the river water was constantly rising, the peasants calmly continued to reinforce the embankment of the dangerous section. The more than forty ramming implements were hammered even more heavily and forcefully. On the opposite bank of the Sunkou dangerous section, the enemy suddenly opened fire on the Zhangqiu ramming workers. Several shells in a row landed near the ramming workers, but the ramming workers showed no sign of panic or disorder and continued their work. Ge Fuxing, a 62-year-old veteran ramming worker from Zhudian, Zhangqiu, had a white beard. When a shell landed not far from him, he squatted down as if forgetting the danger and cursed at the Chiang troops on the opposite bank, "Little bastards, Chiang Kai-shek, if you have the guts, come over here! I've lived for fifty or sixty years anyway, I'll risk this old life of mine!" With a command, the river embankment rang with angry songs: "Chiang Kai-shek is a big bad egg, selling out the country and fighting a civil war, releasing the Yellow River to flood our homes. Good members, for self-salvation, quickly go to the front to join the war!" The enemy on the opposite bank, enraged, fired heavy artillery again and strafed the dike workers on the Sunkou bank with heavy machine guns. However, the peasants, tempered by the long War of Resistance Against Japan, remained calm. They raised their ramming implements even higher and hit them even harder. With each drop of the ram, the ramming workers shouted in unison, "Beat you to death, Chiang Kai-shek, hey... ya!"

    II. County Magistrate Chen Pushes Soil to Repair the River Embankment

　　The midday sun became even more scorching, and the peasants' bodies were soaked with sweat. At this moment, County Magistrate Chen of Fan County arrived, wearing a khaki-colored coarse cloth uniform. Behind the tall figure followed a communications orderly. When the people saw him, they all shouted in unison, "Our County Magistrate is here!" Then smiles of excitement and pride appeared on the peasants' faces. County Magistrate Chen got off the embankment, took over a soil cart, and the loudspeaker on the embankment immediately shouted in a loud voice: "Our County Magistrate Chen has also come to repair the dike, welcome, welcome." The embankment immediately resounded with applause, and people shouted, "We must learn from County Magistrate Chen, keep up the good work!" The people on the Yellow River embankment immediately became tense and launched an invisible competition. Old man Sun Bingzhong said while working, "In the past, when the Kuomintang was in power and we repaired the dike, we couldn't even see the shadow of the county magistrate, let alone push soil to repair the dike. Our county magistrate can share joys and hardships with the people." Soon County Magistrate Chen was soaked in sweat, his face was sunburned red, and his communications orderly was just as soaked. The people affectionately called out again: "Hurry up and take over the County Magistrate's soil cart, let him rest, don't make him sick."

    III. Little Erbai Fights Zhang Qingying While Sick

　　After breakfast on the 19th, the sky was overcast, the south wind was blowing, and the climate was particularly cool. Section Chief Gan had arranged in advance for Little Erbai of Xingyuan Village in the Fifth District and his ramming team of eight young men to compete with Bian Shuangquan, the old foreman of Zhang Qingying. Before the scheduled time, both ramming teams arrived from five or six miles away, along with countless spectators who came to watch the competition. Little Erbai was suffering from malaria that day, and his face was yellow. He was the rammer of the small red ram. Bian Shuangquan, the old rammer of Zhang Qingying, was already an old man in his sixties, wearing a silver Chairman Mao badge on his white shirt. He told me that this was a medal he received while repairing the dike. The old man was full of heroic spirit. At the command of the loudspeaker, "The ramming competition begins!" the two rammers fought in places only a zhang away from each other. Layers of people tightly surrounded them, the small rammers flew up and down, nervously drilling up and down, and the surrounding applause thundered, encouraging them. This eighteen or nineteen-year-old young man became even more energetic. The old man Bian Shuangquan led everyone in singing while hitting. Perhaps due to his age, the ram fell relatively slowly, unlike Erbai's ram, which shook the ground several zhang away when it fell. During the tense moment, Little Erbai's malaria broke out, and beads of sweat dripped from his head, but he never rested until the loudspeaker gave the order to rest, and the two sides stopped. Then the masses proposed a second competition. Little Erbai's small red ram hit even better and faster, and the masses surrounded him to watch. Shuangquan was a white ram, and he tried even harder to surpass Little Erbai, and the battle scene became even more tense, truly inseparable, and neither wanted to give way. Suddenly, a Chiang plane flew in from the south, circling over the river embankment. The ramming workers, who were in the heat of battle, no longer cared about these. The spectators remained tightly surrounded and did not want to leave. Seeing that the situation was not good, Section Chief Gan urgently ordered the ramming workers to stop to prevent enemy plane strafing, and everyone dispersed to hide. By the time the plane returned, they had already dispersed and hidden.

### 紧张的搏斗  黄河堤上鸟瞰

　　紧张的搏斗
    黄河堤上鸟瞰
    一、敌人炮火下，硪工显神勇。
    十六日中午，赤日炎炎，我站在这蜿蜒数百里的河岸上，眼见黄河浊浪滔滔，倾向东流，孙口险工新修的河堤，在惊涛冲击下，不时发出倒塌击水之声，险工的堤坝上拥挤着抢险的人群，这些都是从张秋县到寿张来帮工的翻身农民，河水虽不断在上涨，但农民却镇静的继续增修险工的堤坝，四十多盘硪打得更加沉重有力了，在孙口险工的对岸，敌人突然向张秋硪工开炮了，接连几颗炮弹都落在硪工的附近，但硪工们并没丝毫惶恐与紊乱的表情，仍然继续着他们的工作。张秋朱店一个六十二岁的老硪头葛复兴，他的胡须已经花白了，当炮弹落在他不远的地方时，他像忘记了危险似的蹲起来，指着对岸的蒋军骂道：“小舅子，蒋介石有种，你敢到这边来！老子反正活了五六十啦，豁上这条老命吧！”一声号令，河堤唱起了愤怒的歌声：“蒋介石呀大坏蛋，卖国打内战，放黄水淹没咱们的家园。好会员呀为自救，快到前方去参战！”对岸敌人恼羞成怒，又射来了沈重的炮声，同时以重机枪向孙口岸上的堤工扫射，但是经过长期抗日战争中锻炼的农民，仍然毫不惊惶，他们的硪提得更高而且响得更重了，每个硪一落地，配合着这沉重的响声，硪工们齐声呼叫“揍死你个蒋介石呀嘿……呀！”
    二、陈县长推土修河堤
    正午日光越发毒烈，农民身上都被汗水湿透了，这时范县的陈县长穿着一身土黄色的粗布军装来了，高个子后面跟着一个通讯员，老百姓一见了他都齐声的叫起来：“咱们的县长来了。”于是农民们的脸上都现出了兴奋的和骄傲的微笑。陈县长下了大堤，接过了一辆土车子，大堤上播音筒马上喊出了响亮的声音：“我们的陈县长也来修堤了，欢迎欢迎。”大堤上马上响起来拍拍的掌声，人们也都喊叫起来，“我们要向陈县长学习呀，加油呀！”黄河堤上的人们立即紧张起来了，无形中发起了竞赛。老头子孙炳中一边工作一边说：“过去国民党在时咱修堤，连县长的影子也见不着，别说推土修堤了，还是咱的县长能和老百姓共甘苦。”一会儿陈县长全身被汗水湿透，脸被太阳晒的红红的，他的通讯员也一样把衣裳湿透了，老百姓又亲热的叫起来：“赶快接过县长的土车来吧，叫他歇歇，别累病了”。
    三、小二白带病大战张青营
    十九日早饭后，阴天，刮着南风，气候特别凉爽，干段长预先约好了，五区杏园村的小二白和他那个硪工组的八个青年，同张青营的老工头卞双全赛硪，还没到预定的时间，这两盘硪工都从五六里路的地方赶来了，和他们一块儿来的是无数参观赛硪的群众，这天小二白正发疟疾，脸色黄黄的，他是这盘小红硪的硪头，张青营的老硪头卞双全已经是六十多岁的老头子了，白上衣上挂着一枚银质的毛主席徽章，他告诉我这是修堤时得到的奖章。老头子带着满身的英雄气概，播音筒一声令下，“赛硪开始”，两盘硪在距离一丈远地方战斗起来了，人层紧紧的包围着他们，小硪上下如飞，紧张的钻上去钻下来，四周掌声如雷，鼓舞他们，这个十八九岁的小伙子更加起劲了。老头子卞双全领导大家一边打一边唱着，也许是上了年纪的缘故，硪落的比较慢，不像二白那盘硪落下去几丈远的地皮都震动了。正在紧张的时候，小二白的疟子发作了，头上一颗颗的直冒汗珠，但是他始终不休息，直到播音筒发出了休息的号令，双方才告停止。接着群众又提出了第二次比赛的要求，小二白的小红硪打得更好更快，群众都围着他看，双全是盘白硪，他更加用全力想超过小二白，战斗的场面更加紧张，真是难解难分，互不想让。突然从南边飞来一架蒋机，在河堤的上空盘旋，正在战斗得火热的硪工们再也顾不得这些，观众们仍紧紧的围绕着不想离开，干段长见势不好，急令硪工停止，防止敌机扫射，大家才分散隐蔽，等到飞机再回来时，他们已经分散隐蔽了。
