　　Where is the Key?
    Shexian County Launches Drought Prevention and Famine Preparation Experience
    Zhisheng Huafeng
    (1) Grasping Characteristics and Mass Demands
    When Shexian County began to mobilize for drought prevention and famine preparation, it discovered that several ideologies were hindering the development of the work. Because most of the masses had only just been emancipated this year, and coupled with the heavy burden of supporting the front lines, the masses felt that nothing could be done in the face of drought. For example, Jin Bang of Beigang Village said: "This year's tasks are so heavy, I don't know what will happen in the future. Whether we produce or not, it doesn't matter." Some others thought: "Eating is earning, if it's gone, we'll just 'pick up scraps'! It doesn't matter." Some middle peasants also believed that there would be struggles in the future, and "picking up scraps" wouldn't be useful and might be taken away. Due to the existence of these ideologies, the work could not be carried out. However, thanks to the efforts of various cadres, breaking through these ideas and resolving them has yielded many experiences:
    1. Focus on the poor and hired peasants, using the painful lessons of famine years to break through ideological barriers. This mobilization method resolves ideological problems the fastest, because the majority of the rural population, 70 percent, are poor and hired peasants. They suffer the most, especially during the famine years of 1942 and 1943. They suffered the deepest hunger and oppression. Nanguokou Village in the Third District grasped this characteristic and mobilized all the villagers. At the beginning of the mobilization, cooperative director Dou Zhiming immediately convened a family meeting and discussed it with his wife. If it doesn't rain, think about the suffering we endured during the famine! We must prepare early this year. Then he planned that for five people (the whole family) and one animal, they used to eat three jin of millet and four and a half jin of corn, plus more than two liang of salt every day. From now on, they would weigh it every day. In the morning, they would eat two liang of millet with cornbread. In the morning they would eat twelve liang of rice, and in the evening, four liang of rice. They would eat two jin and four liang of rice, plus one and a half jin of corn, a day. After calculation, they could save twelve liang of rice, one and a half jin of corn, and one and a half liang of salt every day. This way, saving for three days would be enough to eat for an extra day, and it was proposed that saving early for one month would allow them to survive for an extra month. Instead of eating dry rice, they would drink rice porridge with vegetables. After this calculation, he immediately convened a meeting of poor and hired peasants in the village, summarized the lessons of the famine years of 1942 and 1943, and advocated saving. Chen Rongzhi, a 56-year-old woman, said: "Two members of my family starved to death in the famine years. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, I would have starved to death too. We must save from the jar top, not from the bottom." Then Li Chengshi said: "We must not forget the pain after the nail is pulled out. We used to borrow grain from the landlords, but now the landlords are gone, we must fight for our own sake. We can't let the landlords laugh at us." Under such discussion and influence, the whole village changed their diet.
    2. After detailed planning, launch a drought resistance and sowing campaign. This is how Shiyao Village in the Second District got started. After the district launched the water carrying and flower planting campaign, it still didn't rain. They convened the emancipated peasants and hired laborers to discuss. Old man Feng Shuquan said: "We should save water to prevent drought. Although we planted 56 mu of flowers, we can't just wait for rain. We should quickly carry water to irrigate and plant more potatoes and pumpkins. Every sprout counts, and every plant counts." Old man Hao Xiusheng, who was over 60 years old, said: "During the famine years, I didn't see millet for a month. I only ate three soft persimmons a day. This year we must save early." His family calculated that eight people ate 1.3 sheng of rice a day. Now they only eat 0.8 sheng of rice, supplemented by children digging for wild vegetables, which is enough. They can save 0.5 sheng of rice a day. They also put forward the slogan of eating less millet and more vegetables. Everyone understood the importance of saving and carrying out drought prevention and famine preparation. They went to the streets to mobilize. First, during this grain transportation, they launched a savings campaign, saving 31 labor days and spending only 1,400 yuan on travel expenses each day. Old man Wang Qisheng brought cornbread and did not stay in hotels or eat noodles, spending only 390 yuan in five days. In addition to planting flowers, the whole village also carried water to plant 12 mu of potatoes, 6,800 pumpkin seedlings, beans, and two mu of Golden Queen melons.
    3. Understanding the active demands of the masses and launching a production and savings campaign. During this grain transportation, the masses in Yuanqu Village in the Fifth District felt that it would be impossible to do anything well because it was not raining and the tasks were heavy. In order to stabilize emotions, the leadership proposed that transporting grain was for annihilating Chiang's army. They were not afraid of drought, only of inaction. The slogan was that fighting drought meant fighting Chiang's army. Cadres went to the streets to mobilize separately. Shen Wuben said: "If we want to survive the famine, we must think of more ways. I heard that we can build canals outside our village, and if they are built, they can irrigate more than 300 mu of land." Based on this demand, the leadership mobilized the masses to build these two canals, which could irrigate more than 300 mu. The masses were very happy. In this way, with the active ideas and demands of the masses, 130 mu of vegetable fields were also irrigated. Women cadre Kong Shixiang led 50 young women to dig 2,500 jin of wild vegetables and changed the production committee to a production and famine preparation committee, putting forward several slogans: (1) We must rush to harvest and sow, every plant counts; (2) Everyone must save 1.5 liang of millet every day, and accumulate 75 jin of vegetables per person; (3) Every woman should weave 25 straw hats, spin 12 jin of cotton, and the men should transport goods, striving to earn 10,000 yuan.
    We believe that the above three mobilization methods have grasped the characteristics of the masses and the conditions of active demands, so the movement has been carried out smoothly. Conversely, in Beigang Village, women made a lot of money weaving straw hats, but the leadership insisted that women stop weaving straw hats and dig wild vegetables, and as a result, it did not work out. These experiences and lessons should be noted.
    (2) Organization and Leadership in Work
    In the organization and leadership of the work, the main thing is to understand the situation and key issues in the village. Solving this key will open up the situation and achieve results.
    1. Resolving the ideological problems of cadres and mobilizing cadres to take the lead is the key to carrying out the movement. This is how Ganquan Village in the Sixth District got started. At the beginning of the mobilization, they first convened a meeting of key cadres to carry out mobilization, proposing that cadres should play a leading role. After the cadres' ideological problems were resolved, they went to the streets to mobilize. They found that the masses had several ideas, such as Han Qinxue's mother saying: "It must rain, and if it doesn't, it won't work even if we dig wild vegetables. I'm already tired of eating vegetables." One middle peasant said: "It won't work to save grain, I'm afraid it will be snatched away in the future." After the cadres understood these ideas, they adopted the method of individual conversations to carry out in-depth mobilization, using the method of recalling the famine years of 1942 and 1943 to enlighten and educate. Emancipated peasant Ning Cunzheng said: "I must save as soon as possible, keep a small stream running, respond to the government's call, and if I don't listen, I'm really a dead dog that can't be leaned against the south wall, I'm shameless." Others suggested "Whoever saves it belongs to them. In the past, we borrowed grain from the landlords, and it turned out that he was taking ours anyway. Now relax, there is no such thing as robbing people under the leadership of our Eighth Route Army!" After this mobilization, the next day, production director Ding Xiangsheng organized 97 people to participate in digging wild vegetables (including 25 children, 30 young people, 31 women, and 4 old men), digging a total of 1,481 jin of wild vegetables in one day. A production and savings movement was universally launched in the village.
    2. Women and semi-laborers became the main force in the movement. After the troops left Dongjiagou in the Eighth District to participate in the war, there were very few laborers left at home. At that time, it was proposed to "fight against the drought and organize rush harvesting and planting." The masses raised the difficulty of lacking labor and said that it was impossible to do it. Based on this difficult situation, in order to prevent a single mu of land from being deserted, the leadership convened all the men and women semi-laborers in the village. After mobilization, they organized four preferential treatment and drought resistance teams, and completely planted all 1,131 mu of white land in the village in half a month.
    3. Organizing surplus labor for production is the main condition for overcoming difficulties in fighting the disaster. Since the proposal to fight against the drought and implement production and savings, all villages have made savings plans, reducing living standards, prohibiting drinking, and calling for not smoking foreign cigarettes and smoking dry cigarettes, etc. The methods are all very good, but on the other hand, it is only passive savings, and there is no active production to overcome the disaster. Ganquan Village in the Sixth District grasped this key point, in addition to calling on all the labor in the village to rush harvest, rush planting, and dig wild vegetables, it also organized surplus labor and animal power, 36 animals for transportation. Fourteen laborers were divided into two shifts, one shift to send boards to the military industry department, and one shift to transport coke back from Cixian County, earning 85,200 yuan in two days of round trip. The masses reflected that "If it doesn't rain, as long as we grasp the production, we can overcome the difficulties and survive the disaster." Others said, "If we continue to do this, there will be no problem in surviving the disaster."
    4. Checking the work is also a good way to carry out the work. Wangjinzhuang in the Fourth District mobilized to sow 239 mu of cotton during the spring plowing. This time, in order to call for drought prevention and famine preparation and organize production, they launched a major work inspection and found that 135 mu of cotton had not sprouted. Based on the situation, they immediately convened a cadre meeting to discuss and proposed: "If more than 100 mu of cotton do not sprout, what will we do for textiles in the future?" Farmers' Association Director Fu Zhou said: "This is a big deal. Textile accounts for 28 percent of our village's farming, so it will be terrible if we can't plant cotton. We should replant it quickly!" The cadres took this major inspection fact to the masses for discussion, and the result was a unanimous proposal: "We can't survive if we can't plant cotton." The next day, they all actively replanted.

　　关键在那里？
    涉县发动防旱备荒经验
    志胜　华峰
    （一）抓住特点和群众要求
    涉县防旱备荒开始发动时，发现有几种思想阻障着工作的开展，因为大部分群众今年都才翻身，又加上支援前线的差务繁重，所以群众遇到了天旱，认为怎么也不行，如北岗村在金榜这样说：“今年差务这样重，还不知将来弄个啥哩，生产不生产吧没有啥”。还有的认为：“吃了是个赚头，没了再‘拾砍’吧！不要紧”。还有的中农户认为以后还要斗争哩，“拾砍”多了也没用，还不知给谁丢哩。由于以上几种思想的存在，影响着工作不能开展，但由于各个干部的努力，打通思想、解决思想收到了不少的经验：
    一、抓紧贫雇，用回忆灾荒年的惨痛教训，来打通思想。这种发动办法解决思想最快，因为乡村百分之七十的大多数都是贫雇农民，他们所受的痛苦最大，特别是四二、四三年灾荒年，他们所受的饥饿压迫最深，三区南郭口村就是抓紧了这个特点，把全村群众发动起来。开始发动时，合作社长窦志明即召开家庭会议，和老婆商量，天不下雨，想想灾荒时，咱受的什么洋罪，今年可得早些防备哩，当时则计划了五口人（全家）一头牲口，过去每天吃小米三斤、玉茭四斤半、盐二两多，以后每天用秤秤，早上吃米二两，配上窝子，上午吃米十二两，晚上吃米四两，一天吃米二斤四两，玉茭斤半，计算后，每天省米十二两，玉茭斤半，盐一两半，这样能节省三天就能多吃一天，并提出早省一月能多活一月，不吃干饭改为米汤加上菜，经过这样计算后，即召开了全村贫雇会议，总结了四二、四三两年灾荒的教训，并提倡节省，五十六岁的老婆陈荣枝说：“俺家三口人灾荒年饿死两口，要不是毛主席，我也饿死了，咱以后要在缸口省，不要在缸底省”。接着李成时说：“咱不要拔了钉子忘了疼，以前咱给地主借粮食，现在地主没了，咱要争口气。不叫地主笑话咱”，就在这样的讨论与影响下，全村都换了饭。
    二、经过详细打算，开展抗旱下种运动，二区石窑村就是这样搞起来，该区发动担水栽花后，天仍不下雨，便召集了翻身农民、贫雇商量，老汉冯树全说：“应该节约防旱哩，虽说栽了五十六亩花，天不下雨可不能等天呀，应该赶快担水浇，除浇外还要多栽山药蛋、南瓜，见苗三分收，种了一棵算一棵。”六十多岁的郝秀生老汉说：“灾荒年我打了一月没见过小米，一天只吃三个软柿，今年可要早些节省哩”，全家算了一下，八口人每天吃一升三合米，现在只吃八合米，再配上小孩刨野菜，就够用了，一天能省五合米。并提出以后少吃小米多吃菜的口号，大家明确了要节约开展防旱备荒的重要，便到各街进行动员，首先在这次运粮中，就开展了节约运动，节省下三十一个劳力，每天只花路费一千四百元，王起生老汉带的糠窝子不住店，不吃面，五天只花了三百九十元。全村除栽花外，又担水栽山药蛋十二亩、南瓜六千八百窑、豆角、金皇后二亩。
    三、了解群众的积极要求，开展生产节约运动，五区原曲村在这次运粮中，群众认为天不下雨、差务重，什么也搞不好，领导上为了安定情绪，提出运粮为了歼灭蒋军，不怕旱、光怕不动弹，只要干，不怕旱，抗旱就是打蒋军的口号。干部便分别到街里动员，申五本说：“要想渡荒得多想办法哩，听说咱村外能修渠，修成了能浇三百多亩地”。领导上就根据这个要求，发动群众修成这两条渠，能浇三百多亩，群众非常高兴，就这样在群众的要求积极想法下，菜地也浇了一百三十亩。妇女干部孔世祥，带领五十个青年妇女刨野菜二千五百斤，并把生产委员会改为生产备荒委员会，提出几个口号：（１）要突击抢收下种，种了一棵算一棵；（２）每人每天要节省小米一两半，每人积菜七十五斤；（３）每个妇女编二十五顶草帽，纺十二斤花，男人搞运输，争取赚一万元。
    以上三种发动方法，我们认为都抓住了群众中的特点及群众积极要求条件，所以运动顺利的开展起来，相反的象北岗村妇女编草帽很赚钱，而领导上非叫妇女停止编草帽去刨野菜不行，结果没搞起来，这些经验教训应予注意。
    （二）工作中的组织领导
    在工作的组织领导上，主要是了解村里的情况及问题关键，解决了这个关键，即打可开局面，收到成绩。
    一、解决干部思想，发动干部带头是开展运动的关键。六区甘泉村，就是这样搞起来的，他们在开始发动时，首先召开了主要干部会议进行了动员，提出干部要起带头作用，干部思想打通后即到各街去动员，发现群众有几种思想，如韩勤学母亲说：“天不能不下雨，如果不下，刨野菜也不行，我吃菜早吃伤啦。”有一个中农说：“省下粮食也不行，将来怕抢着吃了。”干部了解这种思想后，又采取了个别谈话方式深入发动，用回忆四二、四三年灾荒办法，来启发教育，翻身农民宁存政说：“我一定要趁早节约哩，细水长流，响应政府号召，再不听真是死狗扶不在南墙上，不要脸啦”，还有提的“谁节约是谁的，过去借地主粮食，原来他还是拿咱的，现在放宽心吧，咱八路军领导下就没有抢人的事”！经这样动员后，第二天生产主任丁祥生即组织了九十七人参加打野菜（内儿童二十五人、青年三十人、妇女三十一人、老汉四人），一天共打野菜一千四百八十一斤，全村普遍掀起生产节约运动。
    二、妇女半劳力成了运动中的主力，八区董家沟这次参战走后，家里剩下劳力很少，当时提出：“向旱灾斗争组织抢收、抢种”，群众提出缺乏劳力的困难，实在搞不起来。领导上即根据这个困难情况，为了不荒一亩地，便把全村男女半劳力召集在一块，经过动员，组织四个优抗大队，在个半月中将全村一千一百三十一亩白地完全下了种。
    三、组织剩余劳力生产是战胜灾荒克服困难的主要条件。自提出向旱灾作斗争实行生产节约后，各村都订了节约计划，降低生活水平禁止喝酒，号召不吸洋烟吸旱烟等办法都很好，但另一方面，仅是消极的节约，没有积极的去生产克服灾荒，六区甘泉村却抓紧了这个关键，除号召全村劳力突击，抢收抢种打野菜外，又组织了剩余劳力、畜力，三十六头牲口搞运输，有十四个劳力分成两班，一班给军工部送板，一班从磁县往回驮焦炭，来往两天即挣洋八万五千二百元，群众反映说：“天不下雨，只要抓紧生产就能克服困难渡过灾荒。”还有的说：“象这样干下去，渡灾荒是不成问题”。
    四、检查工作也是开展工作的好办法，四区王金庄在春耕中即发动下种棉花二百三十九亩，这次为了号召防旱备荒组织生产，即展开了工作大检查，发现一百三十五亩棉花没有出来苗，当即根据情况，召集干部会议，进行讨论提出：“一百多亩棉花没有苗将来纺织怎么办？”农会主任傅周说：“这可是个大事，咱村耕三余一纺织占百分之二十八，种不上花可糟糕，应赶快补种吧！”干部即拿这个大检查事实到群众中讨论，结果都一致提出：“栽不上棉花可不能过。”第二天都才积极的补栽起来。
