On the anniversary of the uprising in Haicheng, all commanders and soldiers of our Democratic Allied Army extend to you our cordial and lofty greetings!

Under your leadership and the leadership of the Party, government, and military leaders of the Northeast Liberated Area, after a year of experience and learning, we have cleansed and are cleansing the old ideas and old ways of working planted by the old society and the old army that are anti-people. We have established and are establishing new ideas and new ways of working to serve the people, and we have improved and are improving the relationship between the army and the people and the relationship between officers and soldiers. Now we are continuing to work hard to carry out rectification and training, determined to become an invincible people's armed force like the entire People's Liberation Army. At the same time, we are learning to engage in production to reduce the burden on the people. Recently, we have also sent some people to participate in the actual struggle on the front lines.

Thanks to your wise leadership, the People's Liberation Army has achieved great victories on all fronts and has gradually gained the initiative, which will surely make future achievements even more brilliant. The national people's opposition to treason, civil war, and dictatorship has a clear direction, and the victory of the national people is even more certain. We have made the greatest determination to intensify our study, complete the army-building plan as soon as possible, so as to go to the battlefield of people's self-defense as soon as possible, and participate in the glorious cause of liberating the Northeast, liberating all of China, and liberating Yunnan.

Pan Shuoduan, Zheng Zuzhi, Xu Wenlie, Ma Yifei, Wei Ying, leading all commanders and soldiers, respectfully bow.
