Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 24th – Cadres at all levels of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Democratic Government, from the county and district to the township levels, led guerrilla units, persisted in vast areas, and victoriously carried out struggles against grain robbery, against special agents, and against puppet regimes. Gao Shanxiang, the deputy captain of the Yan'an County guerrilla team, who was commended by the Border Region Government, established guerrilla groups in Liulin and Fengfu districts and in various townships soon after Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's troops invaded Yan'an. Within a month, he killed or captured more than 30 enemy personnel, including a battalion commander, seized more than 20 guns, and forced personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime to resign and flee. This guerrilla team was called the "backer" by the people. Another "Yanxi Guerrilla Team" in Yan'an County repeatedly defeated the grain-robbing enemy in Yandianzi and other places last month. They also organized the masses in the border areas to evacuate and fortify their homes, thwarting the enemy's looting activities again and again. The enemy in Wa Yao Fort was surrounded by guerrillas and dared not venture more than fifteen li outside the city. On one occasion, Chiang Kai-shek's planes dropped dry rations to resupply the enemy troops in Wa Yao Fort, and the guerrillas rushed to grab them, leaving the enemy in the stronghold helpless to watch. The guerrilla warfare in the Guanzhong Sub-region is particularly well-reputed. On the outer front: the guerrilla team has successively liberated important towns in Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas such as @yi County, Jiaoping, and Longfang, and in coordination with a main force unit, once liberated Yao County, shocking Xi'an. On the inner front: centering on Malan City in the Guanzhong Sub-region, which was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the guerrilla team successively raided puppet town offices near the city, such as Liniuwo and Shizuizi, killing and capturing forty to fifty Chiang Kai-shek puppet Baos and below. The guerrilla team of the second district and third township in the Guanzhong central area (i.e., Malan City) is a model of the militia guerrilla team in the area. The township Party branch secretary, the township head, the self-defense army company commander, and township-level cadres all participated in the guerrilla team. In May, they resisted the enemy's intrusion into Shuanglong three times, covering the safe transfer of the masses. In Jingbian County, Sancha Sub-region, the guerrilla team has grown two or three times since the Self-Defense War began. The county Party committee secretary and the county head personally led the guerrilla team to attack. They resisted the charge of enemies more than ten times their number in Zhangjiapan. Farmers in Changcheng District organized a cavalry guerrilla team to gallop beyond the Great Wall. On the 20th of last month, they attacked more than a hundred enemies who invaded Ye Wushen. Ma Hongkui's officers all said, "Those wearing white headscarves (referring to the militiamen) are not easy to mess with!" In the Longdong area: In Qingyang, Tongchuan, Yima and other districts, the masses have universally established sentry posts for reconnaissance, etc. Without a permit from the democratic government, it is difficult to move an inch. The masses in Tongchuan, Wentai, and other districts have successively uncovered more than ten special agents.
