　　Not Relying on Substitute Farming for Self-Sufficiency
    Model Military Family Member Zhou Yueying

　　Zhou Yueying is a Women's Rescue Association committee member in Xiaonangou, Qin County. After mobilizing her husband to join the army in February of this year, she cultivated 21 mu of land herself, supported her 74-year-old grandmother, and promoted spring plowing among military families and women throughout the village. The village has a total of 60 households, of which 17 have no labor, 17 have insufficient labor, 19 are self-sufficient in labor, and 7 have surplus labor. Calculating this, households lacking labor account for 52 percent, and land accounts for 45.5 percent. Among the households lacking labor, there is a total shortage of 14 full laborers, while households with surplus labor only have 2 surplus laborers. Even after offsetting these, there is still a shortage of 12 full laborers. At the same time, there are 16 military, cadre, and martyr families in the village, accounting for 26 percent of the total number of households, with a total of 391 mu of land, accounting for 30 percent of the village's land. Apart from two households with 63 mu of land that are self-sufficient in labor, and three households with 116 mu of land that only lack two and a half laborers, the remaining 11 military, cadre, and martyr families have 211 mu of land with no labor at all. Based on a total of 920 mu of land in the village, there are only 12 full laborers who can actually participate in labor. If each laborer cultivates 25 mu of land as a standard, and all 16 male half-laborers in the village are mobilized to participate in production, with every two people counted as one full laborer, then all half and full laborers can cultivate 500 mu of land. Furthermore, organizing labor on a "three days work one day rest" basis, then at most 660 mu can be cultivated. There are still 254 mu of land, accounting for 28 percent of the cultivated area. If the labor of the 24 women who are able to work is not fully mobilized, and each person must cultivate more than 10 mu of land, it will not be possible to guarantee that every inch of land is not left uncultivated. Zhou Yueying deeply understood this situation, so she took the initiative to overcome this difficulty. Her guiding principle was to progress from light work to heavy work, from seeking assistance to complete self-sufficiency, and from individual labor to labor exchange and mutual assistance. After the Awakening of Insects, when the ground thawed, the villagers began to move. Zhou Yueying first started with light work such as piling up embankments and filling gullies. However, during the labor process, she felt that one person's efforts were not only inefficient but also too lonely. Therefore, she mobilized young women such as Ma Lanying and others to organize themselves to build embankments. After a few days, everyone felt that the longer they worked, the more energetic they became, and they achieved many results, which stimulated their enthusiasm for labor. Thus, they expanded the scope of production, carrying manure, driving ox carts, and even plowing the land.
    Zhou Yueying personally cultivated 12 mu of autumn fields, and applied an average of 26 loads of manure per mu, exceeding the average fertilization rate in the county. Within the mutual aid group, she weaved cloth for others in exchange for labor cultivating six mu of land, and planted two and a half mu with hemp, reclaiming a good piece of land to plant grapes. In sideline production, she got up early and worked late every day to weave 145 zhang of cloth. Apart from keeping a portion to exchange for cattle, she sold the rest. She also borrowed two hens to hatch ten chicks, and used her savings from last year to buy a plough ox together with others. In addition to influencing others through practical labor, she educated other military families on self-sufficiency through labor whenever she met them. For example, she said to a certain military family member: "The army is for us to join, and production is for us to do. Just because they went out to join the army doesn't mean we should sit at home and eat our fill. The fewer people we have in our family, the earlier we should start," mobilizing many military families. In addition, many people believed that female military family members could not be self-sufficient without preferential treatment. She first learned from the old men the complete set of skills such as positioning manure pans, handling plows, directing livestock, and operating seeders, and then taught them to the women, giving many women confidence in agricultural production. For example, Junhai's wife, a military family member, did not buy livestock and waited for preferential treatment. Later, she felt that Zhou Yueying was also a woman, but she could cultivate more than 20 mu of land, so she decided to buy livestock and strive for self-sufficiency through labor. Under her promotion, among the 16 military families in the village, apart from three who had not yet made their best efforts, two could be self-sufficient. The remaining 11 households would never accept preferential treatment as long as they could think of a way themselves. At the same time, all the women and half-laborers in the village went to work in the fields. (Taiyue Branch of the Xinhua News Agency)

　　不靠代耕生产自给
    模范军属周月英
    周月英是沁县小南沟的妇救会常委，今年二月动员丈夫参军后，自己耕种着廿一亩土地，养活着七十四岁的老祖母，并推动全村军属及妇女参加春耕。该村共六十户，而毫无劳力者则有十七户，劳力不足者十七户，劳力自给者十九户，劳力有余者七户。计算起来，缺劳力户占百分之五十二，土地则占百分之四十五·五。在缺劳力户中，共短少全劳力十四个，而劳力有余户则仅余两个劳力，两者相抵尚缺十二个全劳力。同时该村军、干、烈属共有十六户，占全村户数百分之二十六，共有土地三百九十一亩，占全村土地百分之三十，除两户土地六十三亩劳力可自给，和三户土地一百一十六亩，只缺两个半劳力外，其余十一户军、干、烈属尚有土地二百一十一亩根本无劳力。按全村九百廿亩土地，能实际参加劳动之全劳力共十二个，若以每个劳力耕种二十五亩土地为标准，将全村十六个男半劳力动员起来参加生产，每两个人按一全劳力计算，则全半劳力共可耕地五百亩，再以组织起来三工余一工计算，则至多可耕种六百六十亩。尚有土地二百五十四亩，占全耕地面积百分之二十八，如不将能劳动的二十四位妇女的劳力全部动员起来，并且每个人必须种到十亩以上的土地，便不能保证寸土不荒，周月英深知此种情况，于是自己首先亲自动手克服此一困难，其贯彻方针，是由轻活到重活，由求帮助到完全自给，由单独劳动到变工互助。惊蛰后地了，村人都开始动弹了，周月英便首先堆起了垒堰、填圪道等轻活来做，但在劳动过程中又感到一人用弹不仅效率低，而且太寂寞，于是便动员青年妇女马兰英等四人组织起来垒堰，几天之后大家感到劳动时间愈长精神愈大，获得了不少成绩，激起了劳动情绪，于是扩大了生产范围，担大粪、赶牛车，以至耕地。
    周月英亲自动手，种了十二亩秋田，并且每亩地平均上粪二十六担，超过全县一般施肥量，她在互助组内给别人织布变工耕地六亩，并将二亩半种上大麻，收回了一块好地栽葡萄，在副业生产上，她每天起早搭夜的织成一百四十五丈布，除留一部分换牛外，其他卖去；并借来两只母鸡孵出十只小鸡，把去年的积蓄与别人伙买了一头耕牛。她除用实际劳动影响别人外，遇见别的军属便教育劳动自给，如她向某军属说：“军是给咱参，产是给咱生，他们出外参了军，不是叫咱在家坐吃山空，咱家人少更该早动手”，把许多军属都动员起来。此外许多人认为女军属不优待总不能自给，她便先向老汉们学习定粪盘、掌犁、指挥牲口、摇耧等全套把式，来教给妇女，使许多妇女对农业生产有了信心，如军属俊海女人不买牲口等着优待，后来觉得人家周月英也是个女人，就能种二十余亩地，咱就不行，因此便决心买上牲口，争取劳动自给。在她推动下全村军属十六户，除三户还未尽力劳动外，两户可自给，其余十一户只要自己能想上办法绝不要受优待。同时全村妇女全半劳力都上地劳动了。（太岳分社）
