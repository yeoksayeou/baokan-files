(This Newspaper Taiyue 27th dispatch) The People's Liberation Army on the Southern Shanxi front, before entering the second stage of military training, universally launched a speak bitterness and trace roots movement to improve the political quality of commanders and fighters. In a speak bitterness movement in a certain regiment, after first eliminating the thinking of a few cadres and veteran soldiers that "we spoke bitterness before, so there's no need to speak it now," the speak bitterness and trace roots movement was successfully completed in just four or five days. Wang Rengong, the political instructor of a certain battalion, took the lead in speaking bitterness at the soldiers' meeting, which aroused the bitterness speaking of all the soldiers and cadres. Whether before or after the meeting, day or night, people were pouring out their grievances. Many soldiers lost their appetite due to grief. The leadership comforted them on the one hand and promptly put forward the slogan of "enduring pain to speak bitterness and tracing the roots of bitterness" on the other hand, finally carrying out the speak bitterness movement victoriously. Many soldiers made the determination to "fight for ten years to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan." Now, actively training hard has become a conscious action for everyone in the army. Soldier Liu Xiaomou is greatly different from the past and now strives to do everything first. In the past, his grenade throwing distance was 27 meters, but due to negative thoughts, it regressed to 25 meters. Now, it has improved to 33 meters. Zhang Lungui, a newly liberated soldier, practiced military skills without taking a nap despite being ill. He said: "I can't not practice my skills for the sake of sleeping. To avenge my parents and defeat General Disaster Chiang, I must overcome all difficulties!"

　　晋南前线我军
    开展诉苦追根运动
    提高指战员政治素质
    【本报太岳二十七日电】晋南前线人民解放军在进入第二步练兵前，普遍开展了诉苦追根运动，提高指战员政治素质。某团在诉苦运动中，首先消除了少数干部和老战士的“从前诉过苦现在不要诉了”的思想后，使诉苦追根运动在短短四、五天顺利完成。某营教导员王仁恭自己首先在军人大会上诉苦，引起全体战士干部的诉苦，不论会前会后黑夜白天，都有人在倾吐苦水。许多战士因悲痛废食，领导上一面安慰，一面及时提出“忍痛诉苦追苦根”的口号，终将诉苦运动胜利贯彻下去，许多战士立下“奋斗十年打垮蒋胡”的决心。现在积极苦练已成为全军人人自觉的行动，战士刘小谋和过去大大不同了，甚事情都争先去干。过去投弹二十七公尺，因思想消极退到廿五公尺，现在却进步到三十三公尺。新解放战士张伦贵不午睡带病练兵，他说：“我不能为了睡不练本事，要为父母报仇，打倒蒋总灾，就一定要冲破一切困难！”
