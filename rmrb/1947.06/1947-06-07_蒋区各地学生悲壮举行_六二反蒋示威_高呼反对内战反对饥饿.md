　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Shanghai News: On June 2nd, students in various Jiang-controlled areas broke through the extreme terror and suppression of military police and secret agents, and held gatherings and demonstrations. More than 20,000 students from 36 universities and middle schools in Kunming, and thousands of students from Guangxi University in Guilin, held heroic demonstrations against famine and civil war, shouting slogans such as "Stop the Civil War" and opposing "conscription and grain requisition." They also put forward demands such as "Immediately abolish the Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order," "Guarantee People's Freedom," and "Immediately release recently arrested students and severely punish the perpetrators who abused students." Students in Beijing, Shenyang, Hangzhou and other places solemnly held "Memorial Services for Civilian and Military Deaths in the Civil War" on campuses, mourning the innocent military and civilians who died in the civil war, and protesting against Chiang Kai-shek's forcing the people in the Jiang-controlled areas to be cannon fodder. Students were also divided into many groups to distribute slogans and leaflets on the streets. Furthermore, according to Shanghai press reports: Chiang's military police arrested more than 3,000 students, professors, journalists, and civil servants in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kaifeng, Guiyang, Fuzhou, Qingdao and other places between the 1st and 2nd. Chiang's military police in Wuchang even opened fire and killed three students when searching for students at Wuhan University. However, this kind of terror has not been able to suppress the students' patriotic and righteous actions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: More than a hundred students from Huaiyin Normal School in Northern Jiangsu were abducted by Jiang's army, and the school was also forced to close. According to students Liu Mingyi and Qian Changsong, who fled into the liberated area: On May 5th, a company of Jiang's army suddenly surrounded the school, set up machine guns on all sides, and under the pretext of "going to Shanghai for collective training," forced the students to leave immediately. One hundred and three students were tied into cars under the threat of gun butts and clubs, and their whereabouts are unknown. It is widely believed that this is a disguised form of conscription by Jiang's army.

　　蒋区各地学生悲壮举行
    六二反蒋示威
    高呼反对内战反对饥饿
    【新华社陕北五日电】沪息：六月二日蒋管区各地学生冲破军警宪特极度的恐怖镇压，纷纷举行集会及游行示威。昆明三十六个大中学校学生二万余人，桂林广西大学学生数千人，举行壮烈之反饥饿、反内战示威大游行，高呼“停止内战”，反对“征兵征粮”等口号，并提出“立即取消维持社会秩序临时办法”、“保障人民自由”、“立即释放最近被捕学生，严惩虐打学生的凶手”等要求。北平、沈阳、杭州等地学生则在校内沉痛举行“内战死亡军民追悼大会”，哀悼为内战而牺牲之无辜军民，抗议蒋介石迫令蒋区人民当炮灰。学生并分为许多小组至街头散贴标语传单。又据上海报界透露：蒋家宪警于一日至二日两日间在上海、北平、天津、沈阳、重庆、成都、开封、贵阳、福州、青岛等地曾逮捕学生、教授、新闻记者、公务员达三千余人，武昌蒋记军警并于搜捕武汉大学学生时，开枪击毙学生三人。但此种恐怖并未能镇压住学生之爱国正义行动。
    【新华社陕北五日电】苏北淮阴师范百余学生为蒋军架走，该校亦被迫关门。据逃入解放区之学生刘明义、钱长松谈：五月五日蒋军一个连突将该校包围，四面架起机枪，以“到上海集训”为名，强迫同学即时跟走，一百零三个同学在枪托木棍威胁下，被绑入汽车，不知去向。众信此乃蒋军变相抓丁。
