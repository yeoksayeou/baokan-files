　　Soldiers' Home
    A Sketch of Trench Life
    Ke Gang
    "What is life like for the soldiers in the trenches?" To fully understand, I followed Director Jin of the 104th Unit and Section Chief Zhang of the 64th Unit into the trenches at the front line.
    It was completely unexpected that they had built the trenches so neatly and intricately under the enemy's intense fire! The sides were as smooth as mirrors, with raised sections in the ground and drainage ditches on either side, looking like a small road. Numerous side roads branched out from both sides, where everyone had built their own shooting positions and sleeping quarters, all meticulously crafted with Western-style facades, and inscribed with banners such as "Dig out the roots of poverty," "Achieve great merit," and "Immortal's Cave." Inside, in addition to the beds, everyone had gun racks and dedicated places for clothes, shoes, flashlights, rice bowls, etc. Furthermore, they used bayonets to carve their favorite slogans on the walls inside and outside the sleeping quarters. I went into many people's sleeping quarters and saw that most of their slogans were: "Defend Chairman Mao, perform great deeds for the people!" "Annihilate the Chiang troops, and the poor will stand up!" "The fortifications are our home, we must never lose them even if we die!" "Sweat more, bleed less!" "Learn from Wang Hongfa's experience in digging fortifications!" Finally, I saw the entrance to Xiong Shuyi's sleeping quarters, who had come from the Juan'nan campaign, where it was carved: "If you don't dig fortifications well, you're just a chicken feather (meaning backward)!" I asked him why he liked such a slogan. He said, "I didn't used to put my heart into digging fortifications!"
    Next to the sleeping quarters of each company and platoon, underground tea sheds were dug, with two large vats, one filled with red bean soup and the other with cold water, which was exclusively for washing faces and feet. There was also a small ditch extending separately in another direction, which was the toilet.
    Further ahead, after a turn, I suddenly heard a small band playing the tune "We will not attack unless we are attacked." I thought it was a cultural troupe here. I went inside and saw that it was Club Number Three, where three or four soldiers were playing a combination of *Dazhengqin*, harmonica, and violin. They only glanced at us from the corners of their eyes and continued to play earnestly. I suggested to Director Jin, wouldn't the enemy discover them and shell them if they played music like this? Several soldiers rushed to say: "It's very far away, at least two hundred meters, let them shell us, we won't even piss on them!"
    The club was a half-roomed house below ground level. One soldier said, "With this roof, you can use a grenade launcher and it's useless!" In the middle of the room was a square table covered with a brand-new yellow military blanket. Three-foot-wide wooden boards were erected around it, on which various read newspapers were placed in order. I flipped through them one by one, and there were full copies of the *Wartime Life* newspaper before May 23rd, full copies of the *People's Soldier* newspaper before May 21st, the *Compare* pictorial published by the military region, the *People's Liberation Army* newspaper, the *Ji Lu Yu Daily*, and the *People's Soldier Newspaper*, etc. There were also many military chess, Chinese chess, checkers, and other toys. On the wall was a letter from the border region government慰问the soldiers at the front line and an eye-catching large character slogan – "Don't forget to read the newspaper while playing chess."
    I really admire the soldiers' sense of symmetry. They painstakingly built two two-foot-high square platforms on both sides of the entrance, on which two pots of wildflowers were placed, and in the center hung their own *Wilderness Camp News*, which was extremely lively and rich in content: divided into columns such as roll call, riddles, and poetry collections. Here is a poem by Tian Zhilin, a soldier from the Ninth Squad, titled "The Old Wolf Cannot Save the Little Wolf," which reads:
    "A pack of wolves in the city,
    Chiang Kai-shek is like their own mother,
    The Eighth Route Army saves the people and beats the wolves,
    Their mother is panicked in her heart,
    Comrades, work hard to catch the little wolves,
    Catch the little wolves and catch the old wolf!" Another poem is "Song of Happiness in Merit" by Huang Yigang, a soldier from the 47th Division of the Chiang army who came from the Huanan campaign: "Joyful and joyful, the name of merit is known throughout the world, everyone respects and everyone talks about it, the government will also give awards, the whole family is happy and truly glorious." Another is "Appearance of the Chiang Army" by Zhang Yucheng, deputy of the Third Platoon. Next to this title, he drew a very fat pig, and wrote:
    "The enemy is like a fat pig,
    Everyone thinks of ways to catch it.
    If comrades want to eat pork,
    Everyone works hard to dig ditches,
    If the ditch fortifications are done well,
    You don't have to worry about eating pork!"
    Who says soldiers can't satirize the enemy? Here, two soldiers were playing chess. Suddenly, two American-style Chiang planes came to deliver bullets to the enemy. They pushed away the chessboard, set up machine guns and fired upwards. The planes hurriedly flew upwards, dropping two boxes of bullets in panic. But the wind was too strong, and the white parachutes floated and floated, drifting towards our position. Many soldiers clapped their hands and said, "Good! Such a big bag of supplies!"
    We walked through nearly ten *li* of trenches and did not see a single soldier acting alone or bored. They were either reading newspapers, playing chess, holding criticism meetings, or engaging in almost game-like learning, laughing and asking and answering each other in twos and threes. Among them, the most interesting was the question and answer between Tian Deyao and Li Zhiqin of the First Squad of the Seventh Company: Li asked, "Whose soldier are you?" Tian answered, "I am the soldier of the people!" "What is your mission?" "To eliminate harm for the people!" "Who is the greatest harm to the people?" "The Chiang army." "How do you eliminate them?" "Strive to achieve great merit!" They kept a straight face, and answered fluently. I asked them if the instructor taught them this? They said, "No, we thought of it ourselves."
    When we passed the sleeping quarters of the Sixth Squad, we discovered a new thing that the instructor had not yet discovered. The entire squad spontaneously performed a play without a script. Wu Yi pretended to be a hired worker, Li Shanzi pretended to be the democratic district chief, Li Dengtang pretended to be a local tyrant, and the others pretended to be militiamen and the masses, using their real names. The situation was that in the newly recovered area, the hired worker complained to the local tyrant, and then the masses tied up Li Dengtang and dragged him out of the sleeping quarters. Then everyone laughed and dispersed. I asked them what the name of this play was? They said it was called "The Poor Turn Over!"
    Finally, we arrived at the fortifications of the famous hero who killed the enemy, Xiao Xiang. He was wearing a Chairman Mao medal and another model medal on his chest, and was directing his entire platoon to dig fortifications for the new soldiers who were arriving in the afternoon. He told me that this was the most forward position, and the enemy was only forty meters away. After he enthusiastically inquired about the recent situation of the hero Wang Keqin, he asked me to stand in the position he specified and observe the confrontation between his fortifications and those of the enemy from the outside. I saw a door panel erected in front of his position, with the words "The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners of war favorably, come over and liberate yourself early!" From time to time, people on the enemy's position poked their heads out, glanced at it, and immediately shrank back.

　　战士之家
    战壕生活速写
    柯岗
    “战士们在战壕里生活究竟如何？”为了彻底了解，我随一○四部金主任，六四部队张科长，走进最前线的战壕里去了。
    这是完全想不到的，他们在敌人的密集炮火下把战壕修的如此整洁而复杂！两边削的像镜面一样的光滑，地下凸起，两边留有水沟，看去全然像一条小马路。两旁伸出无数条支路，这里每人都做好了自己的射击工事和寝室，都是精雕细刻的洋式门面，并且书有：“挖穷根”“立大功”“神仙洞”等横额。室内除铺位之外，人人都有枪架，和放衣服、鞋子、手电筒、饭碗等专门设置。此外，他们用刺刀在寝室内外的墙上；刻划着自己最喜欢的标语。我曾经钻进好多人的寝室去看过，他们的标语大部分是：“保卫毛主席，为民立大功！”“歼灭蒋军，穷人翻身！”“工事就是家，死也不许丢掉它！”“多流汗，少流血！”“学习王宏法挖工事的经验！”等，最后我看到鄄南战役过来的雄书宜的寝室门口，那里刻着：“工事挖不好，才算草鸡毛（落后的意思）！”我问他为什么喜欢这样的标语呢？他说：“我从前挖工事是不用心的呀！”
    各连排的寝舍旁边，都挖有地下茶棚，那里放着两个大缸，一缸红豆汤，一缸冷水，冷水是专供洗脸洗脚用的。还有一条小沟单独伸到另一个方向去，那里是厕所。
    再前进，一转湾，我忽然听见有个小型乐队在奏着“人不犯我我不犯人”的曲子，我还以为是文工队在这里哩，我进门一看，那里是第三号俱乐部，有三四个战士用大正琴、口琴、提琴合奏。他们仅仅从眼角里看了我们一下，仍旧认真的吹着拉着。我向金主任建议，这样奏乐是否敌人发觉了会打炮呢？几个战士抢着说：“远的很，至少还有二百米，叫他打吧，尿都不尿他！”
    俱乐部是在地平线下的一座半间天的小屋，一个战士说：“就这屋顶，你就有榴弹炮也扯淡！”室中间放着一张方桌，上面铺有崭新的黄色军毯。四周架起三尺多宽的木板，上面有次序的放着各种读过了的报纸，我一张一张的翻阅，有五月二十三日以前的全份《战时生活》报，五月二十一日以前的全份《人民的战士》报，军区出版的《比一比》画报，《人民解放军》报，《冀鲁豫日报》，《人民战士报》等。另有许多军棋，象棋，跳棋等玩具。墙上贴着边区政府慰问前线将士的信和一条醒目大字——“下棋不忘看报”。
    我真敬佩战士们的对称美学观，他们在门口两旁煞费苦心的砌了两个二尺高的四方台子，上面放有两盆野花，正中挂着他们自己办的《野营报》，内容极为生动而丰富：共分点将、谜语、诗集等栏，这里有九班战士田治林的一首诗，题叫《老狼无法救小狼》，下面写着：
    “城里一群狼，
    蒋介石好比他亲娘，
    八路军救民把狼打，
    它娘心里发了慌，
    同志们努力捉小狼，
    捉住小狼捉老狼！”另一首是滑南战役从蒋军四十七师过来的战士黄义刚作的《立功快乐歌》：“喜洋洋来喜洋洋，立功之名天下扬，人人尊敬个个讲，政府还要给奖赏，全家高兴真荣光。”还有一首是三排副张玉成作的《蒋军之样》，在这题目之旁他画着一只很胖的大猪，下面写：
    “敌人好比一肥猪，
    大家想法把它揪。
    同志要想吃猪肉，
    大家努力挖道沟，
    道沟工事做的好，
    想吃猪肉不发愁！”
    谁说战士们不会讽刺敌人呢？这里有两个战士正在下象棋，突然两架美式蒋机给敌人送子弹来了，他们推开棋盘，架起机枪往上打，飞机忙往上飞，惊慌失措中丢下两箱子弹。但风势太大，白色的降落伞飘着飘着，竟吹向我们的阵地来了，许多战士拍着手说：“好呵！好大的慰问袋！”
    我们走过将近十华里的战壕，没有看见一个战士在单独的活动或无聊的纳闷，他们不是读报、下棋、开检讨会，就是进行着近乎游戏似的学习，三三两两对笑着互问互答。其中要算七连一班田德耀和李治芹的问答最有趣：李问：“你是谁的兵？”田答：“我是老百姓的兵！”“你的任务是什么？”“为民除害！”“谁是老百姓的大害？”“蒋军。”“你怎样除他？”“争取立大功！”他们板着面孔，严肃的对答如流。我问他们这是不是指导员教他们的？他们说：“不是，是我们自己想着说的”。
    当我们走过六班的寝室时，发现了一件指导员尚未发现的新事情，他们全班竟自动的演起了没有剧本的戏来，吴义装雇工，李山子装民主区长，李登堂装恶霸，其他人装民兵和群众，真名真姓，情况就是当地新收复区，雇工向恶霸诉苦后，群众把李登堂捆起来拉出寝室，于是众皆大笑而散。我问他们这戏叫个啥名字？他们说就叫“穷人翻身吧！”
    最后我们走到著名杀敌英雄笑祥的工事里，他胸前着挂一个毛主席奖章和另一个模范奖章，正在指挥他全排同志替下午就要到来的新战士挖工事。他告诉我这是最前哨的阵地了，敌人离这里只有四十公尺。当他热情的向我探询了英雄王克勤的近况之后，他要我站在他指定的位置下从外部参观他和敌人们工事对峙情形，我看见他的阵地前面竖着一块门板，上写“人民解放军优待俘虏，早过来早解放自己！”敌人的阵地上不时有人探出头来，望一下便马上缩下去了。
    五月二十四日夜
