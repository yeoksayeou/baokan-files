　　[This report from Taiyue on the 23rd] In Qinyuan, the Wangjiayuan Mutual Aid Team has mostly finished hoeing the Chinese yam and hemp. Now they are launching a crash effort to hoe the millet. The first team has hoed 229 mu out of 240 mu of millet seedlings. The enthusiasm for hoeing is unprecedented this time, and the reason is that the mutual aid group has solved several important problems: 1. The old wages were settled and new wages were appropriately set. In the past, it was decided to settle accounts monthly, but because the leadership did not follow up closely, the wages for carrying firewood and delivering manure in February were still unpaid, resulting in the members being dissatisfied after prices rose. After discussion, it was decided that the wages from February to March 12 would be calculated at five sheng of rice per work unit. Those who did not want to pay with rice could return the work. 2. The problem of who should be helped first was resolved. When hoeing began, everyone wanted to have their own fields hoed first. Therefore, the brigade specially studied the question of who should go first and who should go later. It was immediately decided that the group leader would lead the fair and reasonable rotation based on the size of the seedlings, the order of planting, the amount of grass in the field, and whether the land was mountainous or flat. This made everyone satisfied, which improved labor enthusiasm and efficiency.

　　王家园合理安排先后次序
    互助大队突击锄苗
    【本报太岳二十三日电】沁源王家园互助大队的山药大麻已大部锄完，现正突击锄谷，一分队的二百四十亩谷苗已锄过二百二十九亩。此次锄苗情绪之高实属空前，其原因是互助组中解决几个重要问题，一、清理了旧工资与适当的规定了新工资。过去曾决定按月算账，但因领导上未抓紧进行，所以仍有二月份担柴送粪的工资未付，以致物价上涨后，组员不满意。经大家讨论后，决定二月至三月十二日前的工资，每工一律按五升米算，如不愿出米者还工。二、解决了先给谁动弹的问题，当锄苗开始时，谁也想先给自己锄，于是大队专门研究谁先谁后的问题，当即决定根据苗子大小，种的先后，地里草多少，山地平地，由组长领导公平合理轮流进行，才使大家心满意足提高了劳动情绪与效率。
