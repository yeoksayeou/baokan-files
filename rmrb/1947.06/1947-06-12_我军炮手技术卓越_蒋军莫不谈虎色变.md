Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The People's Liberation Army has produced a large number of outstanding artillerymen. Zhang Yingyou, the artillery platoon leader of a certain unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, destroyed eight large enemy bunkers and the city defense headquarters building with 59 shells, each hitting its target, during the battle to capture Dongfeng. The infantry's occupation of the high ground southwest of the city before the attack and the complete annihilation of the enemy after entering the city were largely due to the artillery battle. Platoon Leader Zhang was the first to receive the glorious title of "Lin Biao Artilleryman." During the counter-attack at Moshigou on the Lin (Yi) Meng (Yin) Road by the East China People's Liberation Army, Liu Kunshan, a 60mm mortar gunner of a certain unit, fired 50 shells, hitting 49 of them. Except for 20-odd who surrendered, an entire company of the 1st Regiment of the 44th Brigade of Chiang’s 83rd Division was killed or wounded. In the same battle, Wan Guilin, an artilleryman of a certain unit, hit Chiang's military works on Dongda Mountain with all three shells, and the infantry immediately launched an assault, causing an entire enemy company to surrender. After experiencing the shells, the Chiang's troops in various places tremble at the mention of the PLA artillerymen's outstanding skills.

　　我军炮手技术卓越
    蒋军莫不谈虎色变
    【新华社陕北十日电】人民解放军涌现大批出色炮手。东北民主联军某部炮兵排长张英有，于攻克东丰之役，以五十九发炮弹，每发必中的技术，摧毁敌大型碉堡八座及城防司令部大楼。该部步兵攻城前占领城西南制高点及进城后全部歼灭敌人均得力于炮战甚大。张排长首获“林彪炮手”之光荣称号。华东人民解放军于临（沂）蒙（阴）路磨石沟反击战中，某部六○炮炮手刘坤山等连发五十炮，命中四十九炮，蒋军八三师四四旅一团一个连除二十余人缴械外，其余全被杀伤。同次战役，某部炮手万桂林三炮都击中东大山蒋军工事，步兵随即冲锋，使敌一个连全部缴械。各地蒋军尝过炮弹后，对解放军炮手的卓越技术，莫不谈虎色变。
