　　Turned-Over Peasants in Xingtai Second District
    Resist Relying on Heaven for Food
    Intensify Canal and Well Construction
    [Report from our newspaper in Xingtai] Peasants in the Second District, with unparalleled production enthusiasm after their liberation, are building canals and digging wells to combat the drought. On the 10th of last month, village cadres and activists throughout the district held a production and drought prevention mobilization meeting, proposing to actively resist relying on heaven for food and to overcome the drought and famine with all our strength. In the twelve days since the meeting, remarkable achievements have been made. First, in Nan Zhang Village, Gao Jia Tun and four other villages, more than 2,500 laborers were organized to dig seven canals, eighteen li in length, averaging three chi deep and four chi wide. More than 3,500 mu of dry land have been transformed into paddy fields, and the fields are now being irrigated. In addition, Chang Xin, Zhang Village, Shi Village and other villages organized more than 580 laborers to complete a twelve-and-a-half li long, four chi wide, three chi deep major river canal, which is expected to irrigate more than 3,600 mu of land and can be completed within seven days. Villages without the conditions to open canals are digging wells in large numbers and expanding the irrigated area of existing wells. In Xin Zhuang, Pang Ma and three other villages, more than 300 mu of dry land has been converted into paddy fields. In the entire district, 36 villages have repaired 178 waterwheels and are mutually assisting in carrying water to plant more than 1,500 mu of land. The masses in each village are highly enthusiastic and expressed their determination to resolutely protect the original seedlings and plant new seedlings, putting forward the slogan "Planting seedlings early is a lifeline" and vigorously carrying out the drought prevention movement.
