　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th: “Engaging in transportation line warfare against Chiang’s army” is the hallmark of the battles fought by the military and civilians in the Chiang-controlled areas of central Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu in the past half month of May. On May 23rd, the two routes of the People's Liberation Army in central and northern Jiangsu launched a counterattack on the Tongyu Road, a vital supply line for Chiang's army, and at one point captured six strongholds including Shanggang and Gou'an Dun, eliminating more than 1,600 Chiang and puppet troops. On the 30th, after the local armed forces in central Jiangsu captured Lingdian, an important river town in Haimen, Chiang's troops in Qilin Town and the 12th North New Town fled in panic. When the local people burned down the fortifications in the 12th and Qilin Towns, they also scared off Chiang's troops in Yuelai Town, seven miles away. The local armed forces in northern Jiangsu and Huaihai launched a full-scale counterattack along the Shahe River, the Shuhe River, the Yanhai River, and the Liutang River, recovering ten strongholds including Xianguanting, Xuanmiao, Taoma, Zhuma, and Chaishi, as well as hundreds of villages, forcing Chiang's puppet troops to halt their "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the area, which had lasted for half a year. In half a month, a total of 4,316 Chiang and puppet troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One small cannon, 79 light and heavy machine guns, 1,534 rifles and carbines, two grenade launchers, 60,380 rounds of ammunition, 13 war horses, and other military supplies were seized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th: The Donghai Brigade of northern Jiangsu, in coordination with the militia, launched a counterattack west of Anfeng Mountain. At dawn on the 5th, they captured the central strongholds of Mao Wei and Wang Wei, both local Chiang puppet bases, capturing 259 people including Li Jiu, the director of the third township joint defense of Chiang, and seizing 103 rifles and carbines, 2,425 rounds of ammunition, two bicycles, and other military supplies.
