Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 8th (via TASS, New York): Approximately 50,000 trade union members and other progressive individuals participated in a mass meeting at Madison Square Garden, organized by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). New York City Mayor O'Dwyer, a Democrat, and AFL President Green, under pressure from the masses, both demanded in their speeches that President Truman refuse to endorse the anti-labor "Taft-Hartley Act," currently being drafted by Congress. Because the venue could not accommodate everyone, several thousand more people gathered on the streets outside, listening to the speeches broadcast over loudspeakers throughout the four-hour demonstration. This demonstration is one movement within the current wave of mass protests against reactionaries' attempts to further restrict workers' rights and undermine free trade unions. The AFL was compelled to convene the mass meeting in order to maintain its influence over trade union members. Similarly, under mass pressure, Mayor O'Dwyer also participated in the AFL's protest movement. In his speech, O'Dwyer sharply criticized the Republican Party's proposal of this anti-labor bill, which he said was intended to destroy all labor rights and cause the collapse of the national economy. Although some leaders of the AFL were compelled to take this demonstrative action by the masses, they still have not abandoned their reactionary line; for example, the chairman of the meeting withheld a congratulatory telegram from the 600,000 members of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The telegram guaranteed support for the movement against the anti-labor bill and expressed hope that American trade unions would eventually achieve unity.

　　抗议反动派限制工人权利
    纽约五万职工示威
    市长在群众压力下也参加抗议运动
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社纽约讯：约有五万职工会会员及其他进步人士，参加了“美国劳工联合会”所主持的麦迪逊广场花园的群众大会。纽约市长民主党员奥德维尔、美国劳工联合会主席格林等，在群众压力下，都在他们的讲演中要求杜鲁门总统拒绝认可目前国会正在制定的反劳工的“塔虎特·鲍尔法案”。由于会场容纳不了，还有数千人聚集在会场外之大街上，他们自始至终在四小时的示威大会中，倾听着播音机播送的讲演。这一示威大会，是目前群众抗议反动派企图更进一步限制工人权利和破坏自由职工会之浪潮中的一个运动。美国劳工联合会为了保持其对职工会会员之影响，不得不召开群众大会。而且同样的在群众之压力下，市长奥德维尔也参加了美国劳工联合会之抗议运动。奥德维尔在其演讲中，尖锐责难此反劳工法案之被共和党提出；而这一法案是意图破坏劳工的所有权利，并引起国家经济之崩溃。劳工联合会的一些领袖虽为群众所迫而有此示威行动，但仍未放弃其反动路线；例如大会主席就扣留了产业工会联合会六十万会员之贺电。该贺电中保证支持反对反劳工法案的运动，并表示希望美国职工会终将达到团结。
