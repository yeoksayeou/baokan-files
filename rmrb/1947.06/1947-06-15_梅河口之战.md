Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 13th:

　　“Successfully hold, break out and perish!” This was Du Yuming’s order to the reorganized 184th Division, trapped in Meihekou. However, holding on could not escape the fate of destruction either. A captured officer with a Yunnan accent told reporters: "Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to Meihekou!" He said: The fortifications of Meihekou were built under the personal instruction of Chiang Kai-shek to Du Yuming. Countless large and small bunkers, pillboxes, and mother-and-son bunkers, layered like honeycombs, were covered with iron rails, sleepers, and iron plates. Several feet of thick brick and soil were plastered with cement. In addition, there were spiderweb-like chevaux-de-frise, barbed wire, tunnels, and communication trenches, crowding the area. Almost the entire Meihekou was built with fortifications, because it was an important intersection of the Jilin-Shenyang, Siping-Meihe, and Meihe-Ji'an railways, dividing the connection between our North and South Manchuria. Since they occupied this place, the 22nd Division, 54th Division, 195th Division, 184th Division, etc., changed defenses and strengthened it each time. Not long ago, Du Yuming personally came to inspect and was very satisfied, thinking that the fortifications here were a "model in the Northeast." But this model fortification has now been smashed to pieces by the Democratic Allied Army. Residents are dismantling the fortifications and chevaux-de-frise, and moving the wood forcibly requisitioned by the Chiang army back to their homes. The medical staff of the Democratic Allied Army are washing the wounds of more than 170 seriously wounded Chiang army officers and soldiers. One thousand three hundred and forty slightly wounded Chiang soldiers are gathering in front of the office, receiving travel expenses to return home. "Great! This is demobilization, no more being a grandson soldier!" The reorganized 184th Division was not a remnant unit. An officer of Yunnan origin told reporters: After General Pan Shuoduan led his troops to revolt last year, Du Yuming did not hesitate to use the method of digging flesh to heal sores, drawing a group of main force of one or two hundred capable officers from the New Sixth Army and the 52nd Army. He said, "Such an important place as Meihekou cannot but deploy a strong team." Before he finished speaking, his own face blushed a little. After dinner, the reporter met with a commander of the Democratic Allied Army who commanded this battle. He told the reporter three coincidences: First, the Chiang army's demonic hand occupied Meihekou on May 24 last year, and it happened to be a year later, on May 24 this year, that we came to liberate Meihekou. Second, General Pan Shuoduan led the 184th Division to launch an anti-civil war uprising in Haicheng on May 30 last year. The reorganized 184th Division, which Du Yuming painstakingly reorganized, was wiped out just one day short of the anniversary. Third, the troops that helped the 184th Division in the anti-civil war uprising last year happened to be the same warriors who completely and thoroughly eliminated this reorganized 184th Division this year.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 13th: Last month on the 29th, a commander of the Democratic Allied Army's Liaodong front summoned Chen Kaiwen, the Major General Division Commander (formerly mistaken for Deputy Division Commander) of the Chiang Du reorganized 184th Division, who was captured in the Battle of Meihekou, and Zhang Bingchang, the Colonel Regiment Commander of the 51st Regiment. Chen and others looked dejected, and had discarded their insignia and collar badges. When talking about the Battle of Meihekou, Chen said: "Du Yuming ordered me to hold on, and deceived me that the Zeng army (referring to Zeng Zesheng's 60th Army) and the Liao army (referring to Liao Yaoxiang's New Sixth Army) had come to aid from Yongji and Siping. But Siping was besieged, and the Jilin-Meihe road was cut off. I only found out after coming to your army." His words were filled with indignation. A commander asked why they didn't break out? Chen and others smiled bitterly and said: "Our troops would scatter and flee as soon as they left their strongholds. We could only rely on solid fortifications and bunkers to await reinforcements, but we could not withstand your army's artillery bombardment and fierce attack. In the end, the command system was disrupted, and even my order to stop resisting could not be passed down." A commander rebuked them for not heeding the advice in the three letters our army had sent. Chen and others repeatedly said that they had not received a single letter. After pondering for a moment, he said: "It must have been those officers sent by Du Yuming who withheld the letters!"

Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 13th: Frontline reporter Lin Nianxi reported: Before attacking Changtu City, dozens of mountain guns were squatting on the highlands southwest of the city, with their muzzles pointing directly at the bunkers and fortifications in the city. The gunners adjusted the distance and aimed at the target, clearly seeing the Kuixing Tower in the southeast and the Great Temple in the northwest through the gun sight. In the evening, five flares, the signal for the general attack, rose into the sky together, illuminating the villages and trees in the night fog. The artillery company commander shouted: "Fire in four seconds!" Shells flew out of the muzzle one after another, whistling and exploding, and the entire Changtu City was submerged in thick smoke and fire. At this time, our heroes rushed into the city amidst the artillery fire. After eight flares rose twice, the artillery regiment commander transmitted the order: "Cease firing!" The political commissar said easily: "We have broken in!" From the start of the firing to the entry of the troops into the city, the time was only three minutes.

　　梅河口之战
    韩川
    【新华社辽东十三日电】“固守成功，突围灭亡!”这是杜聿明给困守梅河口重编一八四师的命令。然而，固守也同样逃不掉灭亡的命运。一个云南口音的被俘军官告诉记者：“蒋主席很重视梅河口！”他说：梅河口的工事是蒋介石亲自授意杜聿明修筑的。像蜂窝一样层层叠叠的数不清的大小碉堡、地堡、子母碉，上面盖的铁轨、枕木和铁板，几尺厚的砖土外面，还涂抹着洋灰，再加上蜘蛛网般的鹿砦、铁丝网、地道、交通壕，挤得水泄不通。梅河口几乎整个是用工事筑起来的，因为他是吉沈、四梅、梅辑三铁路的重要交叉点，分割我南北满的联系，自从他们侵占了这里以后，二十二师、五十四师、一九五师、一八四师等等，换一次防，加强一次，不久以前，杜聿明曾亲自来视察，非常满意，认为这里的工事是“东北的模范”，但这模范工事，现在已被民主联军打得稀烂。居民正在拆除工事鹿砦，往家里搬运被蒋军强迫征集的木材。民主联军的卫生人员，正在替一百七十多个重伤的蒋军官兵洗涤伤口，一三四百轻伤蒋军，正围在办事处门前，领取回家的路费。“好啊！这可复员啦，再也不当这个孙兵了！”重编之一八四师并不是残部，一个云南籍军官告诉记者：去年潘朔端将军率部举义后，杜聿明不惜挖肉补疮，从新六军五十二军各抽一部主力一二百得力军官组成的。他说：“梅河口这样重要的地方，不能不摆个硬队伍。”话未说完，他自己的脸部有些羞红了。晚饭后，记者见到指挥这次作战的民主联军某指挥员，他告诉记者三件巧事：第一，去年五月二十四日蒋军魔手侵占了梅河口，恰巧过去了一年，又在五月二十四日这天，我们来解放梅河口。第二，潘朔端将军去年五月三十日在海城率领一八四师举行反内战起义，杜聿明煞费苦心重编起来的一共四师，只差一天多不够周年就又被消灭了。第三，去年帮助一八四师反内战起义的部队，恰巧又是今年干脆彻底消灭这个重编一八四师的勇士们。
    【新华社辽东十三日电】上月二十九日，民主联军辽东前线某指挥员，召见梅河口战斗中被俘蒋杜重编之一八四师少将师长（前误为副师长）陈开文及其五一团上校团长张秉昌等。陈等面色沮丧，符号领章均早自行抛弃。谈及此次梅河口战斗时，陈称：“杜聿明命我坚守，并欺我曾军（指曾泽生之六十军）、廖军（指廖耀湘之新六军）已自永吉、四平来援，但四平被围，吉梅路被截断，还是来贵军后才知道。”言下不胜愤慨。某指挥员问其何以不突围？陈等苦笑称：“我们的部队一离开据点，就会四散奔逃了。只能依持坚固工事与碉堡待援，但终抵不住贵军炮火轰击与猛攻，最后指挥系统被打乱，连我发令停止抵抗都传不下去了。”某指挥员责以我军曾三次去信，何以不听劝告，陈等连称一封也未接到。至此沉思有顷后说：“一定是杜聿明派来的那些军官，把信扣留了！”
    【新华社西满十三日电】前线记者林念溪报导：攻击昌图城以前，城西南的高岗上，蹲锯着几十门山炮，炮口直视着城中的地堡和工事。炮手们调好距离，瞄准目标，从炮镜中，清楚地看到东南魁星楼和西北的大庙。入晚，五颗照明弹总攻的信号一齐升上天空，把夜雾里的村庄和树林照得彻亮，炮兵连长叫着：“四秒钟发射！”炮弹一个接连一个的突出炮口，呼啸着爆炸着，整个昌图城被淹没在浓烟和大火中。这时，我们的英雄们在炮声中向城内冲去了。在八颗照明弹分两次升起后，炮兵团长传着命令：“停止射击！”政治委员轻松的说：“我们攻进去了！”从开始射击到部队攻入城内，时间不过是三分钟。
