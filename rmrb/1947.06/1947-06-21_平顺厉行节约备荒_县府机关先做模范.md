　　Pingshun Implements Thrift and Prepares for Famine
    County Government Organs Take the Lead
    [Reported by this newspaper from Pingshun] In order to prevent drought and prepare for famine, the Pingshun County Government and its various organs held a joint mobilization meeting on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. First, County Head Jia and County Committee Secretary Comrade Zhang gave a profound ideological mobilization regarding the seriousness of the current disaster situation, particularly pointing out that: there is still a considerable amount of land in our county (especially in the third and fourth districts) that has not been sown, and the wheat harvest is particularly poor, only 30-40%. There are still quite a few farmers who have turned over who have no food. In addition, given the current war consumption, grain reserves are extremely low. These facts illustrate that famine is seriously approaching us, but our cadres still harbor a paralyzing and侥幸 mentality. If we don't fully recognize this, it will be a great disservice to the masses. Therefore, we should take the lead as role models, thinking long-term and practicing frugality. We should launch a thrift and famine preparedness campaign with the experience of surviving the famine of 1943 and the spirit of hard struggle. Immediately, each unit held discussions and formulated specific thrift plans. After group discussions, it was decided that each person would save five liang of millet per day, and further reduce living standards, with each person not exceeding six jin of white flour per month, and half a liang of lamp oil per night (this was a unified decision of various organs). The county government decided that each department would further reduce consumption based on the already established thrift plan, and use waste paper as much as possible for communication, and implement joint orders and instructions. The slogans proposed were: "Talk less during the day, use less light at night, the kitchen should not waste a jin of rice, a drop of oil, or a liang of salt. From now on, we will not buy vegetables, but will collect wild vegetables during our spare time from work, and strictly implement the guest meal rice ticket and food cost system." The logistics department proposed that it is possible to save money and not go hungry. The method is: exchange millet for miscellaneous grains (one jin of millet can be exchanged for two jin of corn), mix white flour with miscellaneous flour, which can improve the food. Finally, Zhang, the head of the judicial section, proposed that all his subsidy of millet and two pairs of shoes for the second half of the year be saved. Subsequently, many cadres reported their own savings. Now each department is brewing personal plans. It was also proposed that cadres of local origin should write letters home, so that their families would take the lead in preparing for famine in the villages.

    [Reported by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 19th] The organs and schools in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region responded to the call of the District Party Committee to prevent drought and prepare for famine, and launched a wave of donation and thrift. After the first group of nine people, including Comrade Zhang Luoshan, from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Printing Bureau newspaper factory saved wages, rice, single clothes, mosquito nets, and other materials, other comrades successively joined the donation wave. The entire factory donated a total of 383,800 yuan. The Logistics Department of the Fifth Military Subdistrict launched a production and thrift competition, increasing production from 50 pairs of shoes per day to 90 pairs, an increase of more than double. Many workers saved all their wages, shoes, socks, and clothes, etc. Family member Zhou Xinhuan saved two months of relief grain and firewood, and proposed to achieve self-sufficiency in production. Under the leadership of Comrade Zhang Fuchen, the Folk Art Department of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles had 23 donors, donating a total of 952,300 yuan. Teachers and students in Fan County donated 8,540 jin of rice. In addition to self-sufficiency in half-year expenses and food costs, the Second Special Commissioner's Office and Runxing Store also donated 300,000 yuan. Various organs of the Neihuang County Government and the No. 14 District Office saved 413,289 yuan. The family members of the No. 1 Clothing Institute saved 1,090 jin of rice. Currently, the donation movement is being further and enthusiastically carried out.

　　平顺厉行节约备荒
    县府机关先做模范
    【本报平顺讯】平顺县政府及各机关为防旱备荒，特于本月十三日下午召开联席动员会议，首由贾县长、县委书记张同志将目前灾情严重性作了深刻的思想动员，特别指明：本县现仍有不少土地（三、四区最多）尚未下种，尤其麦子歉收，只有三、四成，翻身农民无食者为数尚属不少，再加以目前战争的消耗，粮食储存极少，这些说明灾荒正向我们严重袭来，可是我们干部思想上还存着麻痹侥幸思想，对此如不作充分认识，就是对群众的一大损害，因此我们就应首起做模范，一切从长期着想，作到细水长流，我们应以四三年的渡荒经验及艰苦精神展开一个节约备荒运动。随即各单位进行讨论，并订出具体节约计划，经小组讨论，订出每日每人节约小米五两，并再降低生活水平，每月每人不得超过白面六斤，灯油每夜半两（这是各机关的统一决定），县政府决定各科根据已订的节约计划再行降低，来往通讯尽量利用废纸，实行写联合命令指示。提出口号是：“白天少说话，黑夜少点灯，火房不浪费一斤米、一滴油、一两盐，今后不买菜吃，抽工作余暇采集野菜，严格执行客饭米票菜金制度”。司务处提出既能节约，又能不饿肚，其办法是：小米换杂粮（小米一斤能换玉茭二斤），白面掺杂面，能改善火食。最后张司法科长提出蒋后半年全部津贴小米及鞋两双全部节约，继有不少干部先后报了自己节约数目，现在各科正酝酿着个人计划。又提出本籍干部往家写信，使家庭备荒在村首起模范。
