　　Reclaiming Jianping in Rehe
    Capturing Tianyi Station on the Yehe-Chifeng Line

    [New China News Agency, Jicha Rehe Front, urgent dispatch, 11th] After the Rehe People's Liberation Army recovered Chifeng and Ningcheng, they continued to pursue the remaining enemy forces. On the 8th, they recovered Jianping County, an important stronghold of the Kuomintang army in central Rehe, and Tianyi Station on the Yehe-Chifeng line. The defending enemy, a part of the Provisional 18th Division of the 93rd Army, fled south. Note: Jianping and Tianyi were occupied by the Kuomintang army around last October when they attacked Chifeng.

    [New China News Agency, Jinchaji Front, dispatch, 11th] The militia of Sanxi Zhang (collectively referred to as Da Xizhang, Xiao Xizhang, and Yuanmazhuang) in Xushui annihilated invading Kuomintang troops, creating a brilliant record of zero casualties against ninety-three enemy soldiers. At dawn on May 13th, three regiments of the Kuomintang army, including the 362nd Regiment and the 363rd Regiment of the 121st Division, and the 15th Regiment of the 5th Division, along with more than 300 personnel from the Kuomintang puppet Xushui County government, invaded the Xushui liberated area east of the railway, attempting to sabotage the mass movement for emancipation. At 6:00 AM, two regiments of the enemy advanced to Sanxi Zhang. Our village militia, under the leadership of the District Armed Committee Director and the District Head, calmly engaged the enemy. After a fierce battle, the militia retreated into the village and used the favorable terrain to resist stubbornly. The enemy launched a fierce attack with their superior forces, suffering heavy casualties from the militia's landmines. As night fell, the militia actively withdrew after completing their task of covering the masses' retreat. During the one-day resistance, a total of fifteen Kuomintang soldiers were killed, and nine were wounded. Fifty-six landmines were detonated, killing twenty-two Kuomintang soldiers and wounding forty-seven. One of their machine guns was also destroyed. Our militia suffered no casualties.

　　热河光复建平
    叶赤线上克天义车站
    【新华社冀察热辽十一日急电】热河人民解放军某部收复赤峰与宁城后，继续追击残敌，八日收复热中蒋军重要据点建平县城及叶赤线上之天义车站，守敌九十三军暂十八师一部向南逃窜。按：建平、天义均系去年十月蒋军进攻赤峰前后被侵占者。
    【新华社晋察冀十一日电】徐水三西张（大西张、小西张、苑马庄合称）民兵，歼灭进犯蒋军，创造零比九十三的光辉战绩。五月十三日拂晓蒋军一二一师三六二团、三六三团、五师十五团共三个团兵力及蒋伪徐水县府人员三百余人，犯铁路东徐水解放区，企图破坏群众翻身运动。上午六时该敌两个团进至三西张，我村民兵在区武委会主任、区长等领导下，沉着应战，经激战后，民兵转入村里利用有利地形顽强抵抗，敌人凭其优势兵力猛攻，遭民兵地雷杀伤，死伤惨重。至天黑民兵以掩护群众撤退任务完成，才主动撤出。一天抗击战中，共击毙蒋军十五名，伤其九名，地雷炸响五十六个，炸毙蒋军二十二名，伤其四十七名。并炸毁其机枪一挺。我民兵毫无伤亡。
