[This report from the Yu-Bei Front, June 17th] On the Yu-Bei Front, various units are universally launching the Wang Keqin movement, cultivating their own Wang Keqins, and have successively discovered the Shi Yulun Platoon, Shi Deming Platoon, and Dong Jinde Platoon of the "Nenjiang" unit, the Xu Tongfu Platoon of the "Ji" unit, and the Ren Xiaoxiang Platoon of the 64th unit. Ren Xiaoxiang was liberated from the Chiang army during the Ping-Han campaign. Under the education of the People's Liberation Army, he made rapid progress in all aspects and was one of the first in his unit to achieve great merit. Before the movement to speak out about suffering was launched, he often talked with his comrades in the platoon and slowly began to recount his sufferings. During his time as platoon leader (he has now been promoted to deputy platoon leader), he united the soldiers and improved their skills, making the entire platoon a model platoon. Following the recent congratulatory meeting, the unit called on all units to learn from Ren Xiaoxiang. After the Dahuying battle, the "Nenjiang" unit launched the Wang Keqin platoon movement, learning from the Shi Yulun Platoon, calling for a learning movement that fits practical ideological methods, opposing the resistance thought of departmentalism, and conducting universal heroic visits, introducing the characteristics of the Shi Yulun Platoon. The eighth company of a certain regiment of the "Nenjiang" unit produced Wang Keqin-style model platoon leader Dong Jinde, whose eighth platoon was selected as a model by the entire battalion. Platoon leader Dong was liberated from the 125th Brigade of the Chiang army during the Shaierzhai battle in Hua County on November 20th of last year. Through the education of the People's Liberation Army, he recognized the glory of serving the people and his own future, becoming a conscious people's fighter, and was later promoted to platoon leader. His leadership methods are: (1) Concentrating the wisdom of the masses to implement leadership. (2) The entire platoon conducts ideological mutual assistance to solve the ideological problems of the soldiers. (3) Leading the entire platoon by setting an example. The Shi Deming Platoon, another model platoon of the "Nenjiang" unit, participated in 21 large-scale battles during the ten months of the Patriotic Self-Defense War from August of last year to May of this year, and often took on major combat missions, yet no one in the entire platoon has been sacrificed or deserted to this day, and they have successfully completed their missions each time. Platoon leader Shi Deming recently summarized three experiences in leading troops: (1) Class love, loving soldiers as oneself. Rather sacrifice oneself than sacrifice comrades. (2) Care about the political progress of soldiers, understand the specific difficulties of soldiers, and leadership should be mainly based on praise. (3) Care about the lives of soldiers, do not have a dynamic attitude towards soldiers.

　　王克勤式的模范班在各部队大批涌现
    【本报豫北前线十七日电】豫北前线各部队普遍开展王克勤运动，培养自己的王克勤，先后发现了“嫩江”部队之史玉伦班、史德明班、董金德班，“辑”字部队之徐同福班，六四部队之任笑祥班。任笑祥是平汉战役从蒋军解放过来的，在人民解放军的教育下，各方面进步很快，是该部立大功最早的一个。在诉苦运动未提出之前，他就常和班里的同志谈心，慢慢诉起苦来。在任班长时期（现已提升为副排长），团结战士，提高技术，使全班成为模范班。最近贺功大会后，该部号召各部队向任笑祥学习。“嫩江”部队于大胡营战斗后，即展开王克勤班运动，学习史玉伦班，号召学习运动切合实际的思想方法，反对本位主义的抵抗思想，进行了普遍的英雄访问，介绍史玉伦班的特点。“嫩江”部队某团第八连出现了王克勤式的模范班长董金德，他所领导的第八班被全营选为模范。董班长是去年十一月二十日滑县邵耳砦战斗从蒋军一二五旅解放过来的，经人民解放军的教育，认识了为人民服务的光荣和自己的前途，成为觉悟的人民战士，后被提升为班长。他的领导方法是：（１）集中群众智慧实行领导。（２）全班进行思想大互助，解决战士思想问题。（３）以身作则带领全班。“嫩江”部队又一模范班史德明班，在去年八月至今年五月十个月的爱国自卫战争中，参加大规模战斗二十一次，且多担任主要战斗任务，而全班至今没有一人牺牲或逃亡，每次都胜利完成了任务。班长史德明最近总结出三条带兵的经验：（一）阶级友爱，爱兵如爱自己。宁可牺牲自己，不要牺牲同志。（二）关心战士的政治进步，了解战士的具体困难，领导要以表扬为主。（三）关心战士生活，不要向战士动态度。
