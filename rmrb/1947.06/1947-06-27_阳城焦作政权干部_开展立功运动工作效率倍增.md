Yangcheng Jiaozuo Government Cadres Launch Emulation Drive, Work Efficiency Doubles

[This newspaper Taiyue 23rd dispatch] Since the Yangcheng County government cadres launched the "Serve the People by Achieving Merits" campaign, work efficiency has doubled. In the past, the organizational system of the agencies was unsound, cadres were not proactive in their work, and efficiency was low. When the deputy county chief proposed serving the people by achieving merits, some cadres were not very receptive. For example, Cheng Zhixian said: "The army fights on the front lines, shedding blood and sacrificing their lives, that is called achieving merit. What are we doing in the rear?" Liu Du said: "It's enough to do the work, why boast about merit?" Later, under the guidance of the leadership, everyone was encouraged to praise the good deeds. After more than a month of preparation, the Merit Group was officially established on May 15th, and everyone set out their plans for achieving merit. At the end of May, when the results were summarized, great achievements were made, the ideology of the cadres was transformed, and work efficiency was improved. For example, Guo Anmin, the warehouse accountant, only received and dispatched grain and registered accounts in the past, and never used his brain. Since achieving merit, he has paid attention to accurate calculations, cherished the people's strength, and when allocating grain to various agencies, he tried his best to persuade them not to use civilian laborers, and transported it himself. In one month alone, he saved 12,617 civilian labor days. Li Jie and Cheng Zhixian of the Civil Affairs Section used to issue allocations based on the requisition certificates from higher authorities, regardless of their use. Since the emulation drive, they have strictly reviewed civilian labor and persuaded the requisitioning parties to understand the people's difficulties. A certain recuperating company needed 50 stretchers to transport wounded soldiers. Comrade Li Jie patiently persuaded them to let the lightly wounded walk, saving 43 stretchers, saving 367 civilian labor days in one month. Finance and Accounting Jiu Yulin created a rice ticket matching table, which doubled work efficiency. He used the saved time to help with other work. In the past, the finance and accounting staff were busy all day long and could only collect money from three villages. Since everyone helped each other, everyone paid their dues as soon as they arrived, without delaying any time. A cadre was also taken out to help with the work. Through the emulation drive, the ideology and work style of the cadres have been universally transformed. Shangguan Feng also said: "I used to think that government cadres only gave speeches on policies and laws on the stage at large meetings. Now I deeply realize the spirit of serving the people." In addition, everyone truly realized that a grain of rice from the people is not easy to come by, so they strive to produce and save, and reduce the burden on the people. In addition to agricultural production, the number of cadres and staff members carrying coal every afternoon has increased from three to fourteen, and the office expenses of various departments have also been saved unprecedentedly. It is estimated that more than 160,000 yuan can be saved by the end of the year.

[This newspaper Jiaozuo dispatch] Since the launch of the emulation drive, the work style of the agency cadres has undergone great changes. The most significant manifestations are: (1) Proactively solving difficulties - in the past, the Finance and Grain Section often refused to reimburse or issue grain payments due to slight procedural errors. Now, they proactively take care of the difficulties of various units. The items that should be received are prepared in advance, and they write letters to notify them before they come to receive them. Audit Comrade Wang Guide specifically helped the quartermaster of a training class of more than 300 people to achieve accurate calculations, saving more than 100,000 yuan in food expenses in less than a month, without affecting the improvement of the students' lives. The telephone bureau needed 200 civilian laborers to erect military telephone poles, but after his detailed calculations, it turned out that only 40 or 50 were needed to erect them. (2) Clarifying service to workers and peasants. Li Baoshan and Wang Shouren, two comrades of the Printing Section, were determined to engrave and print the "Jiaozuo Newsletter" well so that the worker and peasant comrades could understand it. The font should be as neat as possible and use as few simplified characters as possible. In order to print the newspaper on time, Comrade Shouren once used a paper roll to open his nostrils when he was sleepy, woke up after sneezing and then continued to work. As a result, it used to take a day and a half to engrave and print, but now it can be guaranteed to be printed in one day. Wang Lianqing, a comrade of the guard squad, is very old, but every time he goes on a business trip, he strives to complete the task and return in advance. Once, when he was sending a stretcher to the hospital, the civilian laborer carrying the stretcher fell ill, so he helped him carry it for an extra distance. (Zhi Rui, Li Ping)

　　阳城焦作政权干部
    开展立功运动工作效率倍增
    【本报太岳二十三日电】阳城县政府干部，开展为民立功运动以来，工作效率提高一倍。过去机关制度不健全，干部工作不主动，效率不高，副县长提出为民立功时，有些干部不大接受，如程志先说：“军队在前方打仗，流血牺牲，叫作立功，咱在后方算个啥？”刘笃说：“作了工作就行，还夸什么功劳”？后经领导上启发大家表扬好的，经过月余酝酿，五月十五日正式成立了立功小组，每人都订出立功计划。五月底总结时，获得很大成绩，改造了干部的思想，提高了工作效率。如仓库会计郭安民过去只是收发粮食，登记账目，从不花费脑筋，立功以来，注意精确计算，爱惜民力，给各机关拨粮时，尽量说服不要使用民夫，自己运。仅一月节省民力一万二千六百一十七个。民政科李捷、程志先两同志过去只要有上级的拨差证，不管何用，照数拨给。立功运动以来，严格审查民力，并说服拨差者体念民艰。某部休养连转运伤兵要五十付担架，李捷同志耐心说服，让轻彩号步行，节省了四十三付，一月中节省民力三百六十七人。财政会计酒玉林创造了米票对数表，工作效率提高一倍。以节余时间帮助其他工作。过去财政会计每天忙个不了，仅能收三个村的款。自大家互助起来后，各各随来随交，不耽误一点时间。并抽出一个干部出去帮助工作。经过立功运动，普遍的改造了干部的思想、作风。上官风还说：“我过去以为政权干部只是开大会上台讲讲政策法令就是了，现在才深刻体会到为人民服务的精神。”此外，大家并真正体恤到人民一粒粮食来之非易，所以努力生产节约，减轻民负。全体干部与事务人员除农业生产外，每日下午担炭的由三人增加到十四人，各科之办公费亦空前节省。预计至年底可节约十六万余元。
    【本报焦作讯】立功运动开展以来机关干部作风有很大转变，其显著表现是：（一）主动解决困难，——过去财粮科往往因为一点手续不对，即不给报销，不给领粮款，现在则是主动照顾各单位困难，应领东西事先都准备停妥，不等他们来领就写信通知了，审计王贵德同志具体帮助一个三百余人的训练班事务长做到精确计算，不到一个月节约菜金洋十万多元，还不影响学员生活的改善。电话局架设军用电杆，需民夫二百人，但经他详细计算，结果还用不到四、五十个就架好了。（二）明确为工农服务。文印李保善、王守仁两同志为了叫工农同志能看懂“焦作通讯”，下决心把报刻好、印好，字体尽量工整，少用简笔字，为了按期把报纸印出来，守仁同志在瞌睡时曾用纸卷通鼻子孔，打了喷嚏后醒一醒又干起来，因之过去天半能刻印出来，现在一天保证能印出来。警卫班王连清同志年岁很大，但每次出差，都争取提前完成任务回来。一次往医院送彩号抬的民夫病了，他替多了一路。（之锐、李平）
