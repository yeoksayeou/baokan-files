　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei Joint Effort to Control the Yellow River
    300,000 People Repairing Dikes
    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office, 6th] The dike repair self-rescue movement in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, under the joint efforts of 300,000 liberated peasants from Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Southern Hebei, has become a surging tide. From Changyuan to Qiyu, along the winding 500-li river dike, crowds of people repairing the dike throng day and night. Everyone has also launched a dike repair competition. Originally, it was stipulated to start work at dawn and end at sunset, but the masses often ate their meals in the middle of the night and went to work before dawn, and did not stop working after sunset. Leading cadres, fearing that the masses would get sick from exhaustion, had to implement work restrictions. Originally, it was planned that each person would do two cubic meters of earthwork per day, but in reality, most did four and a half cubic meters. Women in Fan County, to cooperate with the dike repair, have successively established model classes to participate in production. The women in the county town have also risen up to take charge of financial inspections, and wrote letters to the people repairing the dike in the front, saying: "We have learned how to weed seedlings, have not relaxed field inspections, and will also organize a comfort team to visit and comfort the people on the dike, and participate in the dike repair work." The masses in the front, upon receiving letters from the village, worked even harder, generally working twelve to fourteen hours. Door panel newspapers and broadcasting stations have been widely established at each dike repair site, and models are commended every night. Originally planned to be completed in twenty days, it is now estimated that it can be completed in seventeen days.
    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office, 6th] In the Yellow River dike restoration project rush repair competition, more than 40 cadres and miscellaneous personnel from the administrative office and the guard team, after marching 70 li to the dike, were assigned 15 meters of earthwork, immediately started work, and proposed a competition with the masses, so that half of the five-day project was completed in two days. Everyone was extremely enthusiastic in the competition, especially Secretary Liu, who developed six or seven large blisters on his hands, but still insisted on not stopping work. Under their enthusiastic encouragement, the masses were even more energetic. When the first district of Shou Zhang held a symposium for civilian laborers in the west sub-district on May 22, it was proposed to compete with the north sub-district. At that time, the village chief of Gaozhang Village took the lead in issuing a challenge, and thus a competition was launched between villages. On the 27th, the challenge letter from the west sub-district was written on a small blackboard, and the blackboard was carried with a large flag to challenge the north sub-district workers. After receiving the challenge letter, the north sub-district piled up earth even more vigorously, saying, "We must repair faster and do better than the west sub-district." More than 13,000 civilian laborers in the Kunshan section's dangerous work also launched a competition, and set out the conditions and methods for commending models. Under this mutual competition, the projects were completed ahead of schedule. For example, the entire village of Wulipu in the second district was fully mobilized, starting work early and finishing late, so that the nine-day project was completed in less than three days.

　　冀鲁豫冀南协力治黄
    三十万人修堤
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】冀鲁豫的修堤自救运动，在冀鲁豫、冀南三十万翻身农民共同努力下，已形成热潮。自长垣至齐禹、蜿蜒五百里的河堤上，日夜拥挤着修堤的人群。大家并掀起修堤竞赛，原规定天明上工，日落收工，但群众多在半夜就吃了饭，天未明就上了工，太阳落后还不收工。领导干部怕群众累病了，不得不实行限工。本来预定每天每人做土工二方，实际大多四方半。范县妇女为配合修堤，纷纷成立模范班参加生产。该县城内妇女并奋起担任财查，并写信给前方修堤的人说：“我们已学会了拔苗，没有放松查田，还要组织慰问队到堤上慰问，并参加修堤工作。”前方群众接到村里来信，工作更加带劲，一般工作十二时到十四时。各修堤处都广泛建立了门板报，广播台，每天晚上表扬模范。原计划二十天完成，现估计十七天即能完成。
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】黄河复堤工程抢修竞赛中，行署机关干杂人员及保卫队共四十余人，以七十里的长行军赶至大堤后，即分到土工十五公尺，即时动工，并提出与群众竞赛，使五日的工程两日便完成了一半。竞赛中大家热情极高，尤其是刘秘书，全手磨了六七个大泡，仍坚持不下工，群众在他们的热情鼓舞下，更加有劲了。寿张一区在五月二十二日召开西小区民夫座谈会时，提出要和北小区竞赛，当时高掌村长首先提出挑战，于是村与村间均掀起竞赛，二十七日西小区的挑战书写在小黑板上，打着大旗提着黑板往北小区工上去挑战，北小区接到挑战书后，更有劲的堆起土来，说“一定要比西小区修得快，做得好。”昆山段的险工有一万三千余民夫也掀起了竞赛，并定出表扬模范的条件和办法，这样互相竞赛下都提前完成了工程，如二区五里堡全村总动员，上工早下工晚，使九天工程不到三天就完成了。
