Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: People in the Jiangnan region are resisting the Kuomintang's unlimited corvée labor and exploitation. Over a thousand peasants in Wuxi rioted. According to a report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao last month: The Kuomintang's Highway Bureau First Mechanical Team, under the pretext of road construction, set up "supervisory offices" in Wuxi, Anzhen, and Baoshan to quarry stone and arbitrarily assign labor. The people, unable to bear the burden, gathered several hundred people on May 2nd and destroyed the office. The office's police actually opened fire to suppress them, and beat and injured four people. The public was filled with irrepressible anger, and they gathered more than a thousand peasants from several villages, severely beat the culprits, and destroyed all the equipment. It was also reported that more than a thousand peasants in Wuzhen and Zhentuo townships in Kunshan also "stirred up trouble" on May 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: (Delayed) In southern Anhui, exorbitant taxes and levies are heavy, and the spring famine is severe. Hungry people mostly subsist on bran and grass. Recently, grain robbery incidents have occurred in the cities of eight counties including Jixi, Shexian, Jingde, Ningguo, Jingxian, Wuhu, Xuancheng, and Guangde. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people robbing rice reached over ten thousand, and over ten thousand dan of Kuomintang's traitorous domestic war grain were swept away. Under the heroic action of hungry people fighting for their stomachs, the Kuomintang garrison troops in various parts of southern Anhui repeatedly suppressed them, but to no avail. This trend is still continuing to rise.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: (Delayed) Over two hundred soldiers of the Kuomintang's Security Team in Siyang County, northern Jiangsu, held an anti-hunger demonstration march on the morning of the 23rd of last month, opposing the Kuomintang County Magistrate Tian Desheng and others for engaging in corruption and embezzlement. The marching soldiers shouted along the way, "We want to eat," and "Officials eat and drink lavishly, while the soldiers can't even fill their stomachs." Upon arriving at the county government, they shouted, "Tian Buman (Tian Desheng's nickname) come out and settle the accounts!" and sent representatives to negotiate, but Tian Desheng and the heads of various departments had already been frightened and fled. The soldiers then cursed loudly: "Where has the county magistrate's prestige gone?" "Why are you hiding like a rabbit and a tortoise?" For a time, the shouts were deafening, and the demonstration continued until the afternoon. Later, Security Captain Li Xuewu used force to suppress the demonstration and drove the soldiers back to the barracks, and the situation temporarily calmed down. After this incident occurred, it has caused violent fluctuations among the Kuomintang civil servants and soldiers in the county, who are fleeing and dispersing one after another, and the Kuomintang organization has become a crumbling mess.

　　皖南万余饥民抢米
    泗阳蒋家士兵反饥饿示威
    【新华社华中十九日电】江南人民反抗蒋党无限制的徭役剥削，无锡千余农民暴动。据前月沪大公报载：蒋党公路总局第一机械队以修路为名，在无锡、安镇、堡山设立“监工所”开山取石，任意派差。人民不胜负担，于五月二日集合群众数百人，将该所捣毁。该所警察竟开枪镇压，并将群众四人殴伤，群情奋不可遏，复集合数乡农民千余人，将祸首痛打，并毁去全部物件。又据称：昆山屋镇、砧坡两乡农民千余，五月十六日亦曾“一度骚动”。
    【新华社华中十九日电】皖南苛杂重重，春荒严重。饥民多以糠、草度日。最近绩溪、歙县、旌德、宁国、泾县、芜湖、宣城、广德等八县城内，已发生抢粮风潮。据不完全统计，抢米群众达万余，蒋贼卖国内战公粮万余担被一扫而光。在饥民争肚饱之英勇行动下，皖南各地蒋驻军数度镇压均失去作用，现此风潮仍继续高涨。
    【新华社华中十九日电】（迟到）苏北泗阳县蒋记保安队士兵二百余人，上月二十三日晨作反饥饿示威游行，反对蒋记县长田德生等营私舞弊。游行士兵沿途高呼“我们要吃”，“当官的大吃大喝，小兵要饭也不能饱肚皮”。抵县府后，大叫“填不满（即田德生浑号）快出来算账！”并派代表前去交涉，但田德生及各科长早已吓得逃之夭夭，士兵当破口大骂：“县长威风那里去了？”“为什么象兔子龟孙一样躲起来？”一时人声鼎沸，示威一直继续到下午。后保安队长李学武以武力镇压，将士兵驱回营房，事态始暂告平息。此事发生后，已引起该县蒋记公务员及士兵之剧烈波动。相率逃亡离散，蒋组织已成土崩瓦解之势。
