　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue 13th Dispatch] Over ten thousand soldiers and civilians in the border area of Yuanqu are tensely engaged in the struggle to protect the wheat harvest, and have already harvested 30,000 mu. As soon as the wheat harvest began, several million militiamen sealed off the marginal areas with landmines, and a portion even penetrated the western suburbs of Yuanqu City. In Xiaozhao Village (two li northwest of Yuanqu City), they annihilated the enemy and laid landmines to cover the farmers west of the Liushui River as they rushed to harvest. Now, three large armies have emerged on the wheat harvesting front, carrying out the rush harvest in three ways: (1) The independent battalion, militiamen, rotating combat teams, and Li Shulin's work team, all active on the periphery, carry a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other, helping the masses with the harvest in addition to guarding and fighting. (2) Rear guard, militiamen, self-defense forces, and the masses form armed work teams, led by the chairman of the farmers' association, etc., to rush to the front to harvest. A work team of one hundred and eighty people from the Third District is active in the Xingma, Nanyang, and Beiyang areas. The work team in Shangzhuang has already cut more than 220 mu of wheat in two days. (3) Organs of various county districts organize personnel to help the masses harvest locally. The Yuanqu County Military Committee, under the personal leadership of Director Wu Quan'an, has helped the masses in Nanchen cut eight mu of wheat. The Yangcheng Fifth District Militia Expeditionary Work Team is also actively engaged in the struggle, unfolding activities. During the rush harvest, the masses are very tense, putting forward "Cut wherever it's ripe first," "Harvest quickly, fight quickly, store quickly." Eight villages on the border of the First District have launched a meritorious service campaign for the rush harvest, proposing "Clear the fields in five days, clear the threshing ground in seven days." Under these slogans, Nandengban implemented a total mobilization of all half and full laborers, and in three days of a sudden attack, cut all 100 mu of irrigated wheat in the village. Shangzhuang, Xiagu, and Shangdengban villages also organized 90% of the male and female labor force in voluntary combinations, and cut more than 4,000 mu in three days. In order to help the militia and rotating combat militia participating in the war, the disabled soldiers, cadres, and families of martyrs harvest wheat, Tanjia Village, Xishi Village, Yedian Village, and Dongshi Village organized mutual aid groups for war service, helping them harvest first, and then helping each family harvest their own, also cutting 2,500 mu of wheat in three days. In order to prepare for a major counter-offensive and liberate Yuanqu, many villages first hand over public grain. After the first batch of harvesting in Tanjia, Xingma, Nanbeibaotou, Diantou and other villages, they immediately sent the public grain to the warehouse and then thresh the second batch. After threshing, it was quickly transported to the rear for storage.

    那里先熟那里先割
    随打随藏随交公粮
    【本报太岳十三日电】垣曲边地组织万余军民紧张投入保麦斗争，现已收割三万亩。麦收开始，即有数百万民兵以雷封锁边缘地带，一部并深入垣曲城西郊，在小赵村（垣西城西北二里）歼敌埋雷，掩护流水河以西农民抢收。现在麦收战线上已出现三支大军，以三种办法进行抢收。（一）边沿活动的独立营、民兵、轮战队、李树林武工队，均一手拿枪，一手拿镰，在警戒作战之外又帮助群众收割。（二）后方警卫、民兵、自卫队及群众组成武装扎工队，由农会主席等带到前方抢收。三区扎工队百八十余人活跃于型马、南羊、北羊一带。在上庄的扎工队两天已割麦二百二十余亩。（三）各县区机关在组织机关人员就地帮助群众收割。垣曲县武委会在主任武全安亲自率领下，已帮助南尘群众割麦八亩，阳城五区民兵远征扎工队也积极投入斗争，展开活动。抢割中，群众情绪非常紧张，他们提出“那儿先熟，那儿先割”，“快收、快打、快藏。”一区边境上八村并展开了抢割立功运动，提出“五天地光，七天场光”，在这些号召下，南登坂实行全半劳力总动员，三天突击割完全村水地麦百亩。上庄、硖故、上登坂三村在自愿结合中也组织起百分之九十男女劳力，三天割完四千余亩。谭家村、西石村、冶东、东石等村为帮助参战民夫与轮战民兵们、残军、干、烈属割麦，组织战勤互助组，先帮他们割，然后给各家自己割，也在三天突击割麦二千五百亩。群众为准备大反攻，为解放垣曲，许多村庄先交公粮。谭家、型马、南北堡头、店头等村第一场打过之后，立即将公粮送至仓库再打第二场，打了之后，又迅速运往后边去藏。
