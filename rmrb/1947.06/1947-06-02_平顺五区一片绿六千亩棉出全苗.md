　　Ping Shun Fifth District A Sea of Green, Six Thousand Mu of Cotton Sprouts Completely
    [This dispatch from Ping Shun] The Fifth District conducted an inspection of planting work on the 18th of this month. In the entire district, 11,000 mu of Jin Huang Hou [Golden Queen] sorghum, over 2,000 mu of rape, and over 3,000 mu of native corn have been completely planted, accounting for 40% of the total cultivated land. Cotton planting covers 7,224 mu, accounting for 17.5% of the total cultivated land, exceeding the plan by 1,684 mu. As of now, over 6,100 mu of cotton seedlings have fully emerged, accounting for over 80% of the entire cotton field. The remaining areas have either half the seedlings or a few seedlings. For example, in Yangjingdi Village, 173 mu of cotton were planted, with 160 mu having full seedlings, 12 mu having half seedlings, and only 1 mu having one-tenth seedlings. Looking at the lush green cotton seedlings, the masses are happily summarizing their experiences, saying: "This year's cotton seedlings were successfully established because the government paid close attention, organized well, planted early, planted well, and carried water to plant individually."
    After studying the cotton seedlings that have not emerged, the main reason is that they one-sidedly accepted last year's lesson of planting too deep. This year, they planted too shallowly. Some people simply scattered the seeds on the surface of the soil and harrowed them lightly. After being exposed to wind and sun, the ground quickly dried out, preventing emergence. Secondly, the cotton seeds were not selected well. For example, some people planted shriveled cotton seeds that had been exposed to frost last year, so they did not germinate at all. In order to ensure the full emergence of cotton seedlings, it was immediately proposed: Carry water to replant, ensuring that not a single seedling is missing. This call immediately turned into mass action. For example, in Miaozhuang, Wule, and Xi'an Shan three villages, 70 mu were replanted with water in two days.

### 平顺五区一片绿六千亩棉出全苗

　　平顺五区一片绿六千亩棉出全苗
    【本报平顺讯】五区于本月十八日，对下种工作进行检查，全区一万一千亩金皇后和二千多亩油菜及三千多亩土玉茭已全部下种，占总耕地面积百分之四十。棉花全区共种七千二百二十四亩，占总耕地百分之十七点五，超过计划一千六百八十四亩，截至现在已有六千一百多亩棉花全苗出土，占整个棉地的百分之八十以上，其余有的半数苗或几成不等。如羊井底全村种棉一百七十三亩，全苗者一百六十亩，半数苗者十二亩，一成苗者仅一亩。群众看着绿油油的棉苗，高兴的总结着自己经验，说：“今年棉花能捉住苗是政府抓的紧，组织的好，种的早种的好，担水点种的多。”
    对未出土之棉苗，经研究后，主要原因是片面接受了去年种的太深教训，今年种的又太浅了，有的把种籽只撒在地皮上耢一下，经风吹太阳晒，地很快干了出不来。其次对棉种选择不好，如有的把去年受过风霜的秕棉籽种上了，因之根本不发芽，为了保证棉花的全苗，即提出：担水补栽，做到一颗不缺苗。这一号召马上就变为群众行动，如苗庄、吾乐、西安善三个村两天内即担水补种七十亩。
