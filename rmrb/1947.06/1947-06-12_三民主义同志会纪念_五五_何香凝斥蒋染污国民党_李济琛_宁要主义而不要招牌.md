Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Shanghai dispatch: Hong Kong airmail news: The "Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association" held a commemorative evening party on the "May 5th" anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President. More than 200 people attended, including Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Wen, Deng Chumin, Chen Qiyuan, Li Boqiu, Lin Ping, Ma Yufang, Ma Jian, Chen Junbao, and others. At the meeting, He Xiangning sadly accused: The path the Kuomintang is taking today has stained all true Kuomintang members with mud. Deng Chumin said that he is a Kuomintang member in fact and in law; but he publicly admitted that this was the first time in more than ten years, "because it seems like a shameful thing." Ma Jian, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, denounced "Three Principles of the People" has become a stereotype, "too many stereotypes and forget the real." He angrily said: "Saying Three Principles of the People every day, now only need one principle--democracy--also won't bring it out." In addition, Li Jishen and others also made brief speeches.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Shanghai report: The day after Mr. Li Jishen was announced expelled from the Kuomintang (May 15), he issued a written statement, continuing to criticize the Chiang party's reactionary dictatorship. First he said: Being expelled was expected, but this proves "to what extent the Kuomintang has become reactionary and dictatorial." He also said: "In fact, most Kuomintang members who are loyal to the Three Principles of the People cannot freely express their correct opinions, and they are spiritually equivalent to being expelled from the party." Li pointed out that the reactionaries rely on the signboard of the Kuomintang, causing "doctrine" and "party" to run counter to each other, making true believers of the doctrine in a position where they must choose between the doctrine and the signboard, so Li "would rather have the doctrine than the signboard." It is the third time that Li has been expelled from the Kuomintang, the first time was in 1921, the second time was in 1933, when he led the Fujian People's Government.

　　三民主义同志会纪念“五五”
    何香凝斥蒋染污国民党
    李济琛“宁要主义而不要招牌”
    【新华社陕北十日电】沪息：香港航讯：“三民主义同志联合会”于“五、五”孙中山就任非常大总统纪念日举行纪念晚会，到会有李济琛、何香凝、蔡廷楷、张文、邓初民、陈其瑗、李伯球、林平、马裕芳、马鉴、陈君葆等二百余人。会上何香凝以沉痛心情控诉：今天国民党所走的道路，使真正的国民党党员都染上了一身泥巴。邓初民说他在事实上和法律上都是国民党党员；但公开承认，这还是十几年来的第一次，“因为这好像是一件可耻的事”。香港大学教授马鉴指斥“三民主义”已成为八股，“八股做多了倒把真的忘记了”。他愤慨说：“天天说三民主义，现在只要一民——民主——就死也不拿出来。”此外李济琛等亦均有简短演说。
    【新华社陕北十日电】沪报讯：李济琛氏被国民党宣布开除之次日（五月十五日），发表书面谈话，继续抨击蒋党反动独裁。首称：被开除系意料之中，但由此证明“国民党已反动独裁至如何程度”。又称：“实际上现在大部分忠实于三民主义的国民党员，不能自由发扬正论，他们精神上等于已开除党籍。”李氏指斥反动派依靠了国民党的招牌，使“主义”与“党”背道而驰，使真正信奉主义之党员成为要主义就不能要招牌，要招牌就不能要主义，故李氏“宁要主义而不要招牌”。按李氏为国民党开除党籍此系第三次，第一次为一九二一年，第二次为一九三三年，领导福建人民政府时代。
