　　Hukuan Balanced Corvée Method

　　[Our Newspaper Hukuan Dispatch] In the past, the assignment of corvée labor was chaotic and unfair, so it became a pure burden on the masses. In order to expand the corvée labor base and improve labor efficiency, the corvée balancing method has been re-examined: First, the labor force of the whole village is accurately adjusted. According to the physical strength of each labor force and the actual weight they can bear, they are scored. In order to encourage the development of labor, if the score is not enough, it is assessed at 90% across the board (if they can carry ten catties, only nine catties are assessed). The actual weight is assessed appropriately, and then 60 catties of weight and 60 li of travel, the standard for diligent work, is used as one work unit, with one work unit being ten points (one point equals six catties). Dividing the actual weight they bear by six catties is the standard score for a labor force. For example, if a labor force can actually carry 80 catties, only 72 catties are assessed at 90%. Dividing this by six catties equals twelve points, which is the standard score for an 80-catty labor force (the weight that each labor force can bear must be based on actual conditions and cannot be estimated at all). Then, the labor force of each family in the working age group is averaged into components, which are combined into a total score. When corvée labor is needed, the number of corvée tasks that should be assigned is based on the total score of each household. For example, if there are three labor forces in a family, and the total score is 30 points, when corvée labor is assigned, each point is worth five catties based on the total score of the village, then the assignment should be based on the total score of 30 points for your three labor forces, which means that 150 catties of corvée labor should be assigned. You can use one labor force to complete the task at one time, which is equivalent to the corvée labor of all three labor forces in the family. You can also use auxiliary labor to deliver the goods in time to complete the task, which is also equivalent to the corvée labor of your family in the working age group, and you can also free up labor for other production. This method of scoring based on the physical strength of the labor force, and then assigning corvée labor by household, is a preliminary, fairer, and more balanced new method. In addition to expanding the corvée labor base, improving labor efficiency, and ensuring the timely completion of tasks, this method is also a very good and powerful encouragement to various production tasks. Because participation in war and corvée labor are both counted as work and earn wages, those in the rear must also strive to produce more, earn more work points, and share more dividends, otherwise they will have to repay other people's work or pay wages. Their specific calculation method can be illustrated with an example of a labor force: If a labor force actually carries 80 catties, only twelve catties are assessed at 90%. Dividing this by six catties (the number of catties per point) equals twelve points, which is the standard score for this labor force. The formula is as follows: (80-8) ÷ 6 = 12

　　壶关平衡差务办法
    【本报壶关讯】过去派差既乱又不公，所以在群众中也就成为一种单纯的负担，为扩大支差面提高劳动效率，重新研究差务平衡办法：首先把全村的劳力统调精确，按每个劳力的体力强弱与实能负重斤数给他评分，为了奖励发扬劳力，分不评足，一律以九成评议，（能担十斤只评九斤）把实负斤称评适当，再以勤工标准负重六十斤行程六十里为一勤工，一工为十分（分合重量六斤），按六斤除开他的实负斤数即是一个劳力的标准分数。例如一个劳力实能担八十斤，按九成只评七十二斤，以六斤除开是十二分，就是八十斤劳力的标准分数（每个劳力负重要从实际出发丝毫不能估计），然后按全家在勤年龄的劳力均评成分，合为总分数，待差务来时，以户为单位，照总分派其应出差数。如家里有三个在勤劳力，总分数为三十分，派差时按全村分数分开每分该五斤，那就按你三个劳力总分数三十分计算该派差重一百五十斤，你就用一个劳力一次送完，也顶全家三个劳力之差务，就用辅助劳力能够及时送到完成任务，也一样能顶你家在勤年龄之差务，又可以抽出劳力进行其他生产。这样按劳力的体力强弱评分，再按户派差，是一种初步较为公道平衡的新办法，这种办法除能推广支差面，发挥劳力效率，保证任务及时完成外，对各种生产工作又是一个很大很好的有力鼓舞，因参战支差都顶工都赚工资，所以在后方的也要争取多生产多余工多分红，否则即得还别人工或出工资。他们的具体算法可以一个劳力为例，一个劳力实担八十斤只给按九成评十二斤，以六斤（一分之斤数）除开，即是十二分为这个劳力的标准分，标式如下：（８０—８）÷６＝１２
