Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th. Here is a surprisingly quiet place. A few staff officers, surprisingly few in number, manage the battle reports sent from various front lines. As soon as one set of battle results is compiled, it has to be replaced with a new one, because the later reports show continued increases in the results. On the map hanging on the wall, the small flags marking the positions of the Chiang troops are pulled down one by one and thrown into the wastepaper basket. This means that another division or regiment of Chiang's army has been annihilated. At a speed of more than a hundred li a day, the small flags marking the position of our army are quickly inserted forward, moving several times a day. The attention-grabbing "Siping" has been left behind. A certain general smiled and looked at the map and said to the reporter: "We have returned to the position before and after the Siping battle last year."

The most interesting entertainment in the headquarters is listening to the broadcast from Changchun Radio. Whenever the absurd and outrageous rumors reach everyone's ears, they always laugh so hard that they bend over and clutch their stomachs. Once, when the loudspeaker broadcast "The Communist army has withdrawn from the HuaiDe Princess Ling area, according to the report of our air force reconnaissance, which has not yet been confirmed by the military," a certain general said humorously: "Okay, let's count it as half a rumor!"

According to comrades familiar with the situation, our commanders have never been so relaxed and happy as this time. This time it can be said that they are handling things with ease and commanding as they wish. He added: "This is because our cadres have matured. They can all implement Commander Lin Biao's tactical thinking, and the unity and coordinated action of the entire army have reached the stage where everything falls into place." He added: "Of course, today our rear has good mass conditions."

Everything is just a beginning. This reminds me of the bold words of a certain general when he returned victoriously at last year's New Year's Eve party: "There are no enemies that cannot be defeated, no cities that cannot be captured. Now it is just the rehearsal stage, and there will be wonderful performances in the future." Yes, the development of events in the past few months has been progressing along the originally arranged path, and the wonderful scenes are yet to come.

　　在前线司令部
    杨赓
    【新华社东北八日电】这里是一个寂静无哗的地方，少得惊人的几个参谋人员，管理着从各个前线发来的战报，战果统计刚作好一份，又要换上新的，因为后到的报告，战果续有增加，墙上挂着的地图上，那作为蒋军标志的小旗，一面一面被拔下来扔到字纸篓里去，这就是说，又有一个师一个团的蒋军被歼灭。以百多里一天的速度，那标志着我军位置的小旗，飞快的向前插去，一天要移动好几次。那惹人的“四平注目”都被丢在后面去了。某将军莞尔而笑的谛视着地图对记者说：“我们又回到去年四平作战前后的位置了。”
    司令部里最感兴趣的娱乐就是收听长春电台的广播，每当那荒谬绝伦的造谣传到大家的耳鼓时，总是使人笑得前俯后仰，捧腹不止。有一次当喇叭筒里传出“共军已自怀德公主岭一带撤退说，此为我空军侦察之报告，尚未得军方证实”时，某将军很幽默的说：“好吧，就算你半个谣言吧！”
    据熟悉情况的同志告诉记者，我们的指挥者从来就没有像这次这样的轻松愉快，这次真算是得心应手，指挥如意。他又补充说：“这是由于我们的干部都已经成熟了。他们都能贯彻林彪总司令的战术思想，全军的一致性和协同动作，已经到了水到渠成的阶段。”他又添加一句：“自然，今天我们后方有着良好的群众条件。”
    一切还只是一个开头。这使我想起在去年的除夕晚会上，某将军胜利归来时的豪语：“没有打不垮的敌人，没有攻不下的城市，现在还只是排戏的阶段，今后还会有精彩的大演出。”是的，几个月来的事实发展都在循着原来安排的道路前进，精彩的场面还在后头。
