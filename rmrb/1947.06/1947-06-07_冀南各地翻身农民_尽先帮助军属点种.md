　　Liberated Peasants in Southern Hebei
    Give Priority to Helping Military Dependents with Planting
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 3rd dispatch] During the planting and rush-planting season, various areas in Southern Hebei continue to prioritize helping military dependents with planting. In seven districts of Wu Xun, incomplete statistics show that within a week, more than 1,900 mu of land were plowed for military dependents, and more than 700 mu were planted. The masses put forward the slogan "Military dependents first, then ourselves" during the substitute farming. Village cadres in Liuqiao Village collectively plowed for military dependents, cultivating 29 mu of land. In Qiu County, the first district collectively cultivated 3,152.5 mu, and planted 1,825 mu. Planting has now been completed. Due to early plowing, the spring seedlings have mostly emerged. Additionally, 294 mud houses were repaired for 534 military dependents, and 8 kangs (heated platforms) were replaced. In Ren County, 40 military dependents from Liulei Village required substitute farming, and 17 veteran military dependents already had fixed substitute farming households. All 31 cattle in the village formed a substitute farming team. During the rush planting, 420 mu of sorghum were planted on military dependents' land in one day. Elementary school students in the village, led by teacher Liu Xianting, collected 3,500 jin of firewood and distributed it to military dependents. In Xigaozhuang, Qinghe First District, half a mu of cotton was planted for each military dependent, elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed household. Under the leadership of women's association cadres, 32 young women participated in the planting. In half a day, they planted five mu of cotton for six military dependents, making the delighted veteran military dependent Liu Xiying say: "This is really great! If it weren't for everyone, I would have been really worried!"
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 5th dispatch] Various areas in Southern Hebei are stepping up rush planting. According to statistics from Hetao, Liuzhuang, Xiaomazhuang, Xiwweizhuang, Juxiang Luzhuang, Zhangtun in Ci County, Chenggu in Wei County, Puji Bridge in Nangong, Suzhuang Village in Tianjin, Jinzhai Village in Gaotang, Qi Zhi First and Third Districts Zhangtun, Qinghe First and Second Districts, and Dongxiao District in Yuanzhao Fifth District, 8,361 mu of cotton, peanuts, melons, and vegetables have been rush-planted. Initially, the masses had a serious mentality of relying on the heavens for food. For example, the masses in Chenggu Village, Ninth District of Wei County, said: "There is no sky without rain. Let's wait for the rain. It's not too late after the wheat harvest." The village then held a members' meeting of the peasant association, allowing everyone to recall the experience of overcoming famine in 1932 and exposing the mentality of relying on the heavens for food. Then, they went to various groups to deliberate and organized all forces for rush planting. Chengcizhi Village, except for war support personnel, stopped all unnecessary work. More than 300 people organized themselves into mutual aid brigades, which were divided into three small teams and fourteen groups. Each group consisted of seven or eight young adults, four or five old men, four or five children, six military dependents, and two orphaned and widowed households, who also voluntarily combined for mutual aid. After being organized, everyone began to move under the slogan of "No land left uncultivated, no one left idle, no well left unused, men, women, old and young all together." Zhang Jinbo's group in Chenggu Village, Wei County, planted eight mu of cotton in one day. Wu Haicai, seventeen years old, carried 95 loads of water in one day. Wu Lanjun, Wu Enbo, and Dong Fuqiao carried 270 loads of water and were all selected as models. Qinghe First and Second Districts rushed to plant 4,326 mu. A disabled veteran in Weiwangxianzhuang carried 141 loads of water in one day. Chengcizhi Village created a land exchange method during rush planting. Households closer to the well voluntarily exchanged a season of dry land for those who could not plant, so that everyone could plant some cotton. Currently, the village has exchanged seventy to eighty mu of land.

　　冀南各地翻身农民
    尽先帮助军属点种
    【本报冀南三日电】在点种抢种中，冀南各地仍本先给军属点种的精神进行，武训七个区不完全统计，一周内给军属耕地一千九百余亩、点种七百余亩，代耕中群众提出“先军属后自己”的口号。刘桥里村村干集体给军属拉犁，耕地廿九亩，邱县一区共代耕三千一百五十二亩半，代耕与捎种地一千八百二十五亩，现已抢种完毕，因犁耙的早养了垧，春苗大部已出齐，并给五百三十四户军属泥房二百九十四间、换炕八个。任县琉垒村六十二军属四十户需要代耕，十七户老军属已经固定代耕户。全村的三十一头牛组成代耕队，突击下种时，军属地一天便种了四百二十亩高粱。该村小学生在教员刘宪亭带领下，拾了三千五百斤柴，分给军属。清河一区西高庄，给军属和老弱孤寡每家点足半亩棉，在妇会干部带领下，有三十二名青年妇女参加点种，半晌工夫即给六家军属点了五亩棉花，喜的老军属刘希盈说：“真好，要不是大伙我就真发愁哩！”
    【本报冀南五日电】冀南各地正加紧抢种，据磁县河滩、刘庄、小马庄、西未庄、聚乡路庄、张屯、威县城固、南宫普济桥、天津苏庄村、高唐金寨村、企之一区及三区张屯、清河一二区、元朝五区东小区统计；抢种棉花、花生瓜菜八千三百六十一亩。开始群众靠天吃饭的思想很严重，如威县九区城固村群众说：“没有不下雨的天，等雨吧，麦后下雨也不晚。”该村随即召开农会员大会，使大家回忆三十二年渡灾荒的经验，揭破了靠天吃饭的思想。然后又到各组酝酿，把所有力量都组织抢种。成磁河町村除战勤外，停止一切不必要的工作，三百余人组织成互助大队下分三个小队，十四个小组，每组青壮年七、八人、四五个老头、四、五个儿童、六家军属、两户孤寡也自愿结合互助。组织起来后，在“不荒一寸土、不闲一个人、不歇一口井，男女老少一齐上”的口号下都动起了。威县城固村张金波组一天内点棉八亩。吴海才十七岁，一天打水九十五担。吴兰均、吴恩波、董夫桥三人挑水二百七十担，都被选为模范。清河一、二区突击抢种了四千三百二十六亩；韦王仙庄一位荣誉军人一天挑水一百四十一担。成磁河水在抢种中创造了换地办法，离井近的户种不了的，自愿给旱地换一季，使每人都点种些棉花。现该村已换地七、八十亩。
