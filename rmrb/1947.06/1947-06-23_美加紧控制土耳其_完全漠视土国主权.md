　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Pravda* observer, Mr. Virshinin, recently commented on the American plan for the "modernization of Turkey," writing: When the Americans give "aid" to Turkey, they show complete disregard for Turkish sovereignty. They not only entrust special military envoys to draft plans for future work in Turkey, but also entrust them with the responsibility of leading the execution of this plan. This means that the political goals underlying the "Truman Doctrine" are fully in line with the interests of American industrialists. In addition, war surplus materials and some products of the American military industry are being dumped in Turkey. Senior American officials and various delegations are flocking to Turkey to discuss its "needs" in terms of military equipment with the Turkish General Staff. All Turkish armed forces, munitions factories, and military institutions are subject to foreign control. American capital is also powerfully infiltrating the Turkish economy. American banks have established branches in Istanbul and Izmir, and American trusts have been allowed to conduct large-scale oil exploration in Turkey. Moreover, an economic delegation composed of agents from the largest American banks and companies is expected to arrive in Turkey soon. Foreign companies have been granted unlimited opportunities to invest in Turkish industry. The Turkish currency has long been devalued, with the lira's value against the dollar and the pound reduced to less than half of its original value. Virshinin went on to write: Turkey previously relied mainly on British "aid," but now Turkey has turned to the United States. Some British news organizations have expressed great dismay at this. Sober-minded people in Britain are fully aware that this is a real threat to Britain's position. Turkish democrats are also deeply shocked by the prospect of becoming an American colony. The Turkish people can find no reason for expanding the military, nor for the increased taxes needed to pay interest on loans, nor for maintaining a large army at the expense of the national economy. Anti-militaristic sentiment is even permeating the Turkish army.

　　美加紧控制土耳其
    完全漠视土国主权
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家维尔希宁顷于评论美国的“土耳其现代化”之计划时写道：当美国人给土耳其以“援助”时，他们表现着完全漠视土耳其的主权；他们不但委托特种的军事密使草拟将来在土耳其工作之计划，而且也委托他们在执行此计划时担负领导的责任。这意味着作为“杜鲁门主义”基础的政治目的，是完全符合于美国工业家之利益的。此外并在土耳其倾销战争剩余物资及美国军事工业某部分生产品。美国的高级人员与各式各样的代表团正川流不息地到达土耳其，以便和土耳其参谋部商讨其军备方面之“需要”。土耳其的一切武装部队，军火工厂及军事机构，皆服从于外国之控制。美国资本也正有力地渗入土耳其的经济，美国银行已在伊斯坦布尔及伊斯密两地设立分行，美国托拉斯已被准许在土耳其大规模勘察石油。而且，由美国最大的银行与公司之代理人所组成的经济代表团，预计不久即将抵达土耳其。外国公司已获得在土耳其工业上投资的无穷机会。土耳其的钞票早已被贬值了，里拉对美元与英磅之比值已减为原来的一半以下。维尔希宁进而写道：土耳其的前主要是靠英国“援助”的，而现在，土耳其已转向美国了。英国某些新闻机关对此表示极大的惊骇。英国清醒的人均完全熟知：这是真正危及英国地位的威胁。土耳其的民主人士也正为着变成美国殖民地的境遇，而深受震惊。土耳其人民找不到扩军的理由，也找不到为清付贷款利息之需要而增加的税及维持大量军队以损害国民经济的理由。反军国主义的情绪甚至弥漫在土国军队之中。
