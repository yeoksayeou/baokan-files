　　Strict System of Clear Entry and Exit
    Yuebei Strengthens Warehouse Management
    [This newspaper Taiyue 27th dispatch] The Special Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of model warehouse directors from the eleven counties of Yuebei on the 19th to discuss how to overcome the phenomenon of indiscriminate spending and borrowing in warehouses, and the issue of saving manpower during the summer farming and volunteer transportation. At the meeting, everyone reviewed the lack of strict enforcement of regulations last year, with individual units issuing blank slips at will, resulting in an extra expenditure of 4,000 piculs of grain. Secondly, phenomena such as the lack of standardization of old and new grain scales, the failure to merge large and small warehouses, and the failure to recover borrowed grain also urgently need to be rectified. For example, the grain accountant of Huo County cleared out 160,000 jin of grain in half a year. Grain loss and spoilage in various counties has been reduced from 0.7% to 0.5%, and in some cases even lower than 0.2%. In terms of storage experience, border areas mostly use decentralized storage, and public covenants are established to stipulate open receipt and secret release, concealed entrances, buried mines and camouflage. Inland areas mostly use centralized storage in order to save manpower and facilitate transportation. The meeting also decided that future financial and grain work should focus on reforming and training cadres, and strictly clearing warehouses. Small warehouses in inland areas should be merged into large warehouses, and mountain village warehouses should be merged into warehouses on major transportation routes. The meeting also emphasized implementing regulations, practicing strict storage, reducing loss, spoilage, and hidden reserves, stopping indiscriminate spending and borrowing, accurately grasping the situation to achieve clear entry and exit, and ensuring supply. Finally, everyone made plans to perform meritorious service for the people, and challenged each other in competitions, determined to do a better job in warehouse work.

　　严格制度清入清出
    岳北加强仓库管理
    【本报太岳二十七日电】专署于十九日召集岳北十一县的模范仓库主任会议，讨论如何克服仓库中的胡支乱借现象，与夏屯义运中节省民力问题。会中大家检讨去年对制度执行的不严格，个别单位便随开空白条子，以致多开支四千石粮食，其次如新旧粮秤未划一，大小仓库未合并，借出的粮食未收回等现象也急须整理。如霍县粮食会计半年中便清理出十六万斤粮食。粮食的耗脱，各县已从千分之七降到千分之五，有的还低于千分之二。在保管的经验上，边沿地区多是分散保管，并订有公约规定明收暗放洞口埋雷与伪装。内地则多集中保存，以求节约民力，便于运输。会中并决定今后财粮工作要以改造与培养干部，严格清理仓库为中心，内地小仓库并为大仓库，山庄的并到交通要道上，并贯彻制度，实行严密保管，减少脱耗腐烂与埋伏，停止胡支乱借，精确掌握作到清入清出，保证供给。最后大家均作出为民立功计划，并相互挑战竞赛，决定将仓库工作作得更好。
