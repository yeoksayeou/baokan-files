　　Labor Hero Takes the Lead
　　Promoting Economical Planting
　　Jia Fu-kui of Tongtan Takes the Lead in Planting Corn

　　[Our newspaper, Zuoquan News] Cadres and heroes in Tongtan Township take the lead in setting out year-round drought prevention, preparedness, and economical methods. The township has 3,232.8 mu of land. Except for special crops and soil corn, which have all sprouted, only the millet seedlings have not yet emerged. The masses want to wait for rain before planting. Model cadre Shen Wen-kui and labor hero Jia Fu-kui took the lead, first setting out their own drought prevention, preparedness, and economical plans. Then, they convened an emergency mobilization meeting, calling on people not to wait for rain and land not to rely on heaven, but to fight against the drought. Because there are few wells in the village, the masses feel that carrying water is too time-consuming, so the slogan is "Planting one more seedling alive means one more meal to eat. Even if it rains tomorrow, we must fight the drought today!" They also proposed: Summer Solstice is too late to plant millet on the high mountains; if you don't plant it now, you won't be able to plant it at all. Therefore, the masses discussed changing the millet land to corn. Currently, 47 mu of corn have been planted while soil is still moist, 15 mu of corn have been planted by carrying water, and two canals have been opened along the river ditch, which can irrigate 40 mu of land. Carrying water to plant seedlings is in full swing. The whole village has now formulated a long-term plan for economical preparedness. Based on the experience of the 1943 famine, the whole village has set out six economical preparedness methods: (1) Eat more millet rice and less broken rice noodles. (2) Collect wild vegetables. (3) The 1,398 people in the village who are at home should each save one tael of millet per day. (4) Advocate not smoking paper cigarettes or drinking alcohol at weddings. (5) Pay attention to cultivating economical activists to become leaders in guiding drought prevention and preparedness.

　　劳动英雄带头
    推动点种节约
    桐滩贾富魁带头点玉茭
    【本报左权讯】桐滩镇干部英雄带头，定出全年防旱备荒节约办法。该镇有土地三千二百三十二亩八分，除种特种作物和土玉茭全部出土现已捉住苗外，只有谷苗未能出土。群众想等下了雨再种，模范干部申文魁、劳动英雄贾富魁首起带头，自己先定出防旱备荒节约的计划，接着召开了紧急动员大会，号召人不等雨，地不靠天，要和旱灾作斗争。因为村上水井少，群众感到担水太误工，所以提出口号是“多栽活一棵就能多吃一顿，明天下雨今天也要和旱灾斗争”等响亮口号，并提出：夏至高山不种黍，再要不种就种不上了，因此群众讨论谷地改茬种玉茭现已趁垧土溜玉茭四十七亩，担水栽玉茭十五亩，靠河沟开渠两道，可灌田四十亩。担水栽苗正进入紧张阶段，现全村订出长期节约备荒计划。接受四三年灾荒经验，全村定出了六项节约备荒办法：（一）多吃小米饭，少吃破米面。（二）采集野菜。（三）全村在家一千三百九十八口人，每人每日要节约小米一两。（四）提倡结婚不吸纸烟、不喝酒。（五）注意培养节约积极分子，成为引导防旱备荒的带头人。
