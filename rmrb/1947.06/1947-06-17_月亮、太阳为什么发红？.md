　　Why Do the Moon and Sun Appear Red?
    Peng Qingzhao
  Question:
    Dear Editor: On the night of June 4th, the moon appeared deep red when it first rose, and later remained light red. On June 5th, the color of the sun was also different. In the evening, the sun turned into a scarlet disc while still high in the sky and set quickly, almost in a "jumping" manner, and it seemed to get dark earlier. What is the reason for this? Please explain.
  Yan Lin June 5th
  Answer:
    Comrade Yan Lin: The phenomenon you describe, though not common, is not surprising. It is due to excessive moisture in the air, a sign of impending rain. Of course, if conditions don't develop favorably, it may not necessarily rain.
    Too much moisture in the air usually turns into clouds. However, sometimes the air contains too few charged dust particles, so even with a lot of moisture, clouds (visible white water vapor) do not form. This water vapor, which hasn't turned into clouds, is transparent and invisible. Therefore, when there is a lot of such water vapor in the air, the sky doesn't darken, and remains a bright azure blue, but we feel stuffy. At the same time, the sun and moon appear somewhat red.
    Since the sky around the sun and moon is clear, the reason for this redness (too much water vapor) is not easily noticed by most people, leading to many strange speculations.
    Why does sunlight or moonlight appear yellow or red when passing through air with high moisture content? Sunlight is composed of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet light. This can be demonstrated by shining sunlight through the edge of a thick glass prism, which separates it into a spectrum of seven colors (moonlight is reflected sunlight, so it has the same properties). Among these seven colors, red light is the least likely to be blocked by air, with the others being slightly more susceptible, and cyan, blue, and violet light being the most easily blocked.
    The cyan, blue, and violet light that is blocked in the air is scattered, making the air appear a pale cyan-blue. This is why the sky usually appears cyan-blue.
    However, under normal conditions, only a small portion of the light is blocked and scattered in the air. When there is more water vapor or dust in the air, more cyan, blue, and violet light is blocked, making the red, orange, and yellow light dominate in the transmitted light. Therefore, sunlight and moonlight appear yellow, or even red.
    When the sun or moon is rising or setting, the light passes through a thicker layer of air, so the cyan, blue, and violet light cannot pass through, and the transmitted light usually appears red. At that time, if there is a lot of water vapor in the air, even yellow light cannot pass through, so it appears scarlet.
    The sun and moon appear larger when rising or setting because of the refraction of light. An increase in moisture in the air can make this phenomenon more pronounced, causing the sun to appear enlarged before it sets. This red and large setting sun is actually an image. The real sun has already set below this image. When the light is blocked by excessive water vapor in the air, the image disappears, making it seem to suddenly jump down.
    After the sun sets, the air cools, and if there is too much water vapor in the air, it can block the sunlight reflected from high altitudes. Therefore, "twilight" also appears shorter, and it gets dark quickly after the sun sets.
    P.S.:
    Comrades Yuan Yuxi, Song Shuhua, and Gao Yilan, your questions have been answered in this letter and will not be answered separately. The black spots in the sun seen by Comrade Gao are not a solar eclipse, but are called sunspots, which are vortices of hot gas on the sun and become particularly numerous and obvious over a certain period.

　　月亮、太阳为什么发红？
    彭庆昭
  问：
    编者同志：六月四号夜里，月亮初出时带深红色，以后也带浅红色。六月五日，太阳的颜色也不同，傍晚太阳还很高就变成猩红色的一大盘，落下很快。并且是“跳跃式”的落下，天黑得好像早了些，这究竟是什么原因，请你解释一下。
  岩林  六月五日
  答：
    岩林同志：你问的那种现象，虽不常见，可见也并不奇怪，那是由于空气中水汽太多，是一种下雨的征兆。当然，如果不好好发展，也不一定下雨。
    空气中的水汽太多，通常就变成云。但是，有时候空气中带电的灰尘太少，水汽即使非常之多，也不会变成云（能见到的白色水汽），没有变成云的水汽是透明、看不到的，因此空气中这种水汽多时，天空并不昏暗，是仍旧明朗地现着蔚蓝色，不过我们觉得闷热。同时，太阳和月亮看起来有些发红。
    由于太阳和月亮周围的天空是明朗的，这个发红的原因（水汽太多），不容易为一般人看出来，因此引起很多古怪的猜测。
    太阳光、月光通过水汽多的空中，为什么现出黄色或红色呢？要知道太阳光本来就是由红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫七色光线合成。这用厚镜子的棱角耀着太阳光，就能使它分开，现出七色的光带（月光就是反射的太阳光，所以性质和太阳光一样）。这七种光里面，红光最不易被空气阻住，其余依次稍差，以青、蓝、紫光最易受阻。
    在空气中受阻的青、蓝、紫光，就分散在空中，使空气现出淡淡的青蓝色，这是平时天空现出青蓝色的原因。
    不过在平时，空气中受阻分散的光线，只有极少一部分。空气中水汽或灰尘多时，青蓝紫三色光线受阻的多了，红橙黄色光线在透过的光线中占了优势，因此日光月光现出黄色，甚至红色。
    太阳或月亮出没的时候，光线经过的空气层较厚，青蓝紫三色光线通不过，因此透过的光线，通常带红色，在那时，空气中水汽如果很多，黄色光线也透不过，因此便现出猩红色。
    太阳、月亮在出没时，看起来格外大，是由于光线发生曲折的原故。空气中水汽的增加，可以使这种现象更显著，使太阳在未落之前，就散漫变大。这个又红又大的夕阳，其实是一个影象，真正的太阳这时已经落在这个影象之下，当光线为空中过多水汽遮断时，影象也就消失，看起来，就好像忽然跳跃落下。
    太阳下山之后，空气冷了，空气中如有过多的水汽，就能阻止由很高的空中反射下来的日光。因此，“黄昏”也显得比较短促，太阳下山后，天就很快的黑了。
    附启：
    袁玉西、宋淑华、高一兰等同志，你们所提问题已在这封信中答复了，不另作答。高同志所见太阳中的黑点，并非日蚀，而叫做日斑，是太阳上热气体的漩涡，过一定时期，特别多而明显。
