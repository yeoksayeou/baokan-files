　　On May 6th, the enemies in all the bunkers around Houma were wiped out, leaving only the Nanbao stronghold, isolated there. The sun was gradually setting, and the soldiers were very anxious. The political instructor was pondering:
　　"The enemy has been deterred by our army's artillery fire. What they want is to escape, not to resist. And what we want is to wipe them all out before dark."
　　After making this judgment, the instructor, full of confidence, decided to take it down with a political offensive.
　　So he wrote the first letter and asked an old lady to deliver it to the blockhouse, saying in the letter: "The surrounding battles are over, it is a dead end for you to hold out, and laying down your weapons is the only way out."
　　Two hours passed, and there was no reply. He sent a second letter saying: "Consider what to do. The superiors ordered us to resolutely eliminate you. We feel it is a pity to kill you. One more letter, please consider it quickly!"
　　A reply came, and the KMT company commander said in a sophistical tone: "Anything is possible, but we need an order from our regimental commander or battalion commander."
　　"Obviously wanting to drag it out until dark to escape, damn it, write another letter, if you don't surrender, then..." Everyone realized the enemy's intention.
　　The third letter was written like this: "Your battalion and regimental commanders have long told you to surrender your guns. After they came over, they have been escorted to the rear. They cannot write to you. I hope you will not hesitate any longer, time is running out."
　　The enemy hurriedly replied: "We are in the midst of democratic consultation!"
　　Our comrades, some walked back and forth in the trenches, some had disappointed expressions on their faces, and some angrily said: the enemy is too hateful. The instructor finally wrote a fourth letter: "Don't hesitate any longer! In half an hour we will test the mountain guns, please clear the area near here to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Reply within half an hour."
　　The battalion political instructor also walked over and said to the blockhouse:
　　"Hey! Sentry on the blockhouse, tell your company commander to come out, I'll talk to him, we will never shoot, and you don't shoot either."
　　"Speak! Don't be afraid, we will never shoot, if we shoot we are not human."
　　"You are from the 49th Regiment of the 17th Division, right!" a liberated soldier shouted.
　　"Yes!"
　　"The 17th Division used to be a good unit. During the Xi'an Incident, it demanded resistance against Japan. We can't bear to kill you. Your old division commander Kong Congzhou is here, do you know?"
　　"We know," someone shouted loudly from the blockhouse.
　　"I am from the 55th Division, and I used to be with Division Commander Kong," another soldier interjected.
　　"We know, the old people of the past all know."
　　"Division Commander Kong is now the commander of the New 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army. The comrades who came with him are all very good!"
　　"We've all heard about it." There were many voices above, making it difficult to distinguish how many people were speaking.
　　"Because you are all victims, we can't bear to kill you," the political instructor said, word by word, as if giving a lesson.
　　"We are all conscripted soldiers, we don't want to fight anymore, but there is no way out."
　　"Where is your company commander? Please ask him to talk to us face to face."
　　"The company commander said: as long as you allow us to go home, we will surrender!"
　　"We can agree to let you go home, surrender quickly!"
　　"The Eighth Route Army is a good army," many people stood up above and shouted loudly, "After we surrender, can you send us out?"
　　"Yes, those who go home will be given a travel pass and travel expenses!"
　　"Good! Good!" The shouts above were even more chaotic.
　　"What about personal belongings?" a southern accent asked.
　　"Absolutely not, we don't even search prisoners' pockets on the battlefield, this is our Eighth Route Army's policy."
　　"Good army" the cries from above merged together.
　　It was gradually dusk. The instructor looked at his watch and became a little anxious: "Decide quickly! Another ten minutes! It is now 6:15, check your watches!" Someone above really checked their watches, and the chaotic voices went up and down.
　　We moved the mountain guns and heavy machine guns to the front line, preparing to fire.
　　A moment of silence.
　　"How is it! Make a final reply quickly."
　　"I am from the First Division. The Eighth Route Army treated me very well after I surrendered. What are you afraid of?" A liberated soldier, understanding the enemy's thoughts, shouted loudly.
　　The enemy heavy machine gun platoon leader spoke up: "My platoon wants to surrender, I can't control the others, let's discuss it."
　　"Where is the company commander?"
　　"Hiding," someone said after a pause.
　　"Come down first! We'll put up a ladder for you."
　　After we put up the ladder, the enemy heavy machine gun platoon leader took the lead, carrying a machine gun body, and quickly came down. Following him was a large group, and the company commander, who had changed into soldier's uniforms, was also mixed in the middle of the infantry company, all rushing out.
　　The soldiers all stood up from the trenches, clapping their hands and shouting:
　　"Surrendering doesn't mean being beaten."
　　"Welcome, welcome!"
　　"Good! Good!..."
　　Those who came down automatically formed three horizontal lines, with two heavy machine guns, one 60mm mortar, eight light machine guns, and more than seventy rifles placed in front. After the ranks were formed, they automatically counted off, from one to one hundred and seventy, and still hadn't finished.

　　瓦解
    立云
    五月六号，侯马周围，各个碉堡的敌人都歼灭了，只剩下南堡一个据点，孤立的残留在那里。太阳渐渐偏西了，战士们很烦闷，政治指导员在思虑着：
    “敌人已被我军的炮火所震慑，他们要的是逃生而不是抵抗。而我们要的是天黑以前将他们全部歼灭。”
    指导员这样判断了以后，十分有信心的，要用政治攻势把它攻下来。
    于是他写了第一封信要一个老太太送到炮楼上，信中说：“周围战事已完，你们孤守是死路，放下武器才是生路。”
    时间挨过了两点钟，没有回信，他又送了第二封信说：“考虑如何，上级命令我们坚决把你们消灭，我们感到打死你们太可惜，再去一信，希快斟酌！”
    回信来了，蒋军连长用狡辩的口气说：“怎样也可以，只是要我们团营长来个命令。”
    “明明是想挨到天黑逃跑，他妈的再写封信，不投降就……”大家觉察了敌人的意图。
    第三封信是这样写的：“你们营团长早就说叫你们缴枪，他们过来后已解往后方，不能给你们写信，希勿再犹豫，时光已经不早。”
    敌人急忙回答说：“我们正在民主商议啊！”
    我们的同志们，有的在壕沟里走来走去，有的脸上带着失望的表情，有的气愤说：敌人太可恶。指导员终于又写了第四封信：“别犹豫了，半点钟以后我们要试山炮，请把靠近这边的地方让开，免遭无谓牺牲。限半点钟答复。”
    营教导员也走过来，对着碉堡说：
    “喂！碉堡上那个哨兵，叫你连长出来，我和他谈谈，我们决不打枪，你们也不要打枪。”
    “说吧：不怕，我们决不打，打枪就不是人。”
    “你们是十七师四十九团的吧！”一个解放战士喊起来。
    “是呀！”
    “十七师过去是好队伍，西安事变曾要求抗日，我们不忍打死你们，你们的老师长孔从周在这里，知道吧！”
    “知道。”堡碉上高声大叫。
    “我是五十五师的，以前也和孔师长在一起。”又一战士插上嘴。
    “知道，过去的老人都知道。”
    “孔师长现在当了西北民主联军新卅八军军长，跟他来的同志都很好！”
    “我们都听说了。”上面说话的声音很多分不清是几个人的声音。
    “因为你们也都是受苦人，我们不忍打死你们。”教导员像上课一样一字一句的说。
    “我们都是抓来的兵，早就不想打了，没法子啊。”
    “你们连长呢？请他来当面谈谈”。
    “连长说：只要准许回家就缴枪！”
    “回家可以答应，快缴枪吧！”
    “八路军是好队伍”，上面很多人站起来大声喊着说：“缴了枪能把我们送出去吗？”
    “好，回家的给开路条，给发路费！”
    “好！好！”上面喊声更嘈杂了，
    “私人的东西要不要？”一个南方人的口音。
    “绝对不要，战场上俘虏，我们还不搜腰包哩，这是我们八路军的政策。”
    “好队伍”上边嚷成一片。
    天渐渐黄昏了，指导员看看表他有些焦急：“快决定呀！再限十分钟！现在是六点一刻，对对表！”上面真的有人对了表，嘈杂的声音一会儿高，一会儿低。
    我们把山炮、重机枪都摆到前沿上，作着发射准备。
    刹那间的沉寂。
    “怎么样！快作最后答复。”
    “我是第一师的，交了枪八路军待我很好，你们怕什么？……”一个解放战士摸透了敌人心思，大声叫喊着。
    敌重机枪排长搭话了：“我的一排要缴枪，别人我管不了，商议一下再说。”
    “连长呢？”
    “躲起来了，”停了一下有人说。
    “你们先下来吧！给你搭个梯子”。
    我们把梯子竖上以后，敌重机枪排长为首，扛着一个机枪身，迅速走了下来，跟着来的是一大群，换上战士服的连长也夹杂在步兵连的中间一齐往外涌。
    战士们都从战壕里站起来，拍着手乱喊乱叫：
    “缴枪不打人。”
    “欢迎，欢迎！”
    “好！好！……”
    下来的人自动站成三路横队，跟前放着两挺重机枪，一门六○小炮，八挺轻机枪，七十多支步枪。队伍站好以后，自动报数，从一报到一百七十还没有报完。
