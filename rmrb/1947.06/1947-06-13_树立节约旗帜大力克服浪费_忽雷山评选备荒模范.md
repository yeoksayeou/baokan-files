　　Raise the Banner of Thrift and Vigorously Overcome Waste
    Hulei Mountain Selects Drought Preparedness Models
    [This Newspaper, Wu'an News] Hulei Mountain Village in the Fifth District is summing up its drought preparedness planting. In the past half-month, the entire village has carried water to plant 120 mu of cotton, 14 mu of corn, 1,950 kilns of pumpkins, and 1,385 kilns of cowpeas. Many models and those who save and plan for the future should be commended. First, groups were organized for discussion. Old middle peasant Wang Wu said, "I know the Communist Party will never struggle against middle-peasant households, and they want us to live thriftily. When I carried a stretcher, it only cost 80 yuan, but some people spent 8,000 yuan." Newly emancipated peasant Wang Cunzhu said, "In the past, savings went to the landlords, but now savings belong to ourselves. We must prevent drought every year, rely on the heavens for food, and adjust our meals to our work. If it doesn't rain in the spring, we must be thrifty. We shouldn't eat freely until the grain ears turn yellow. Eat thick when doing heavy work, and eat thin when doing light work. Thinking back to the famine years, saving two dou of rice now won't let us starve to death later." Sixty-year-old Wang Dianwen realized that flower seeds were not widely planted this year, so scarcity makes them valuable. Pumpkins and cowpeas should be planted sooner rather than later. He personally carried water to plant 1.2 mu of cotton, planted half a mu of corn, and planted 27 kilns of pumpkins. Wang Chenlin, despite having a limp, actively carried water to plant cotton and promoted the planting of 36 mu of cotton in his group. Wang Fenglin carried water three li to plant three mu of "Golden Queen" [cotton]. The group meeting selected eleven models for production and drought preparedness and elected a Production and Drought Preparedness Merit Committee. The eleven models were immediately graded and credited, totaling two special-class merits, three first-class merits, and six second-class merits. Amidst enthusiastic applause, each model was given a "Certificate of Merit" made of plum-red paper. Encouraged by the enthusiasm, each group and individual formulated plans for future production and drought preparedness achievements: Voluntary teacher Wang Dianqing's family of five consumes five jin of white flour per meal. If it is replaced with corn mixed with some bran, it can last for three days. They plan to exchange the wheat harvested in May for rice or corn. Mutual aid group leader Wang Yang made a plan saying, "It took a lot of effort to plant the cotton, and now it is about to die from drought. I must quickly push the hoe to thin the seedlings and save the cotton seedlings from dying. Wheat fields near the water source must be watered to plant corn. If it rains and we plant together, we won't be able to weed it, so we need barren land. Those far from the water source should open kilns. Even if it only rains a little, we can still plant. If it doesn't rain for a day, we must fight." During the organization and evaluation process, attention was paid to grasping positive factors and overcoming negative factors, and overcoming the phenomenon of wasteful eating and drinking from commending those who save and plan for the future, promoting the spirit of active planting struggle, and overcoming the passive thinking of waiting for rain. Although the entire village is in the midst of a tense wheat harvest, they continue to carry water for planting, save cotton seedlings, and open kilns. No one is seen eating white flour in the meal market. (Shang Ting)
    [This Newspaper, Shexian News] After planting flowers in Shentou, the issue of drought prevention and preparedness was raised, but everyone's enthusiasm was not high. Later, they looked back and summarized the cotton planting and selected eight heroic models, the best of whom was Feng Zijing, who planted one mu himself and also mobilized and helped others carry water to distant places. Shen Ertai, who was a lazy person, has become willing to work. At the summary meeting, Shen Ertai said, "I used to be a lazy person, but I must change in the future and be productive and thrifty, with a steady stream of income." In this way, everyone enthusiastically discussed drought resistance and preparedness work. The masses unanimously said, "We must be thrifty in the future." The village calculated that the consumption of buying wine and cigarettes from the village alone amounted to 2,502,400 yuan, which is equivalent to 86 shi and 6 dou of rice at market prices. In this way, the masses further recognized the importance of drought resistance and thrift and put forward the slogan: "No lavish funerals for the dead, no inviting relatives or using sedan chairs for weddings." Therefore, production and thrift have become a movement. (Chong Zhi)

　　树立节约旗帜大力克服浪费
    忽雷山评选备荒模范
    【本报武安讯】五区忽雷山村总结点种备荒。半月来全村担水种棉一百二十亩，种玉茭十四亩，种南瓜一千九百五十窑，豆夹一千三百八十五窑。有不少模范及节省打算会过时光的应当立功。首先分组酝酿讨论，老中农王五的发言：“我知道共产党决不斗争中农户，还要俭省过时光，我去抬担架只花了八十元，有的人却花八千元。”新翻身户王存柱说：“过去节省归地主，现在节省归自己，年年防旱，看天吃饭，看活做饭，春天不下雨，就得俭省，非到谷穗黄时才敢放手吃，做重活吃稠，做轻活吃稀，想起过去灾荒年，现在省二斗米到后来也饿不死。”六十岁老汉王殿文想通今年普遍没种花，缺者为贵，南瓜豆夹宜早不宜晚，亲自担水种棉一亩二分，栽玉茭半亩，栽南瓜二十七窑。王辰林拐着一条腿还积极担水种棉，并推动全组种棉三十六亩，王风林担水三里地栽金皇后三亩。经小组大会选出生产备荒模范十一名，并选出生产备荒立功委员会。当场给以上十一位模范分等记功，共计特等功二人，头等功三人，二等功六人，在热烈的掌声中发给各位模范用梅红纸制的“功劳书”，群众在热情鼓舞下，各组各人纷订今后生产备荒立功计划：义务教员王殿清家五口人吃一顿白面得五斤，如换成玉茭再掺点糠能吃三天，计划将五月收下的麦子换成米或玉茭。互助小组长王羊订计划说：“费了九牛二虎之力种上棉花，现在快要旱死，我要赶快推锄间苗抢救花苗不死。离水近麦田要担水栽上玉茭，如下雨后一齐下种，锄不出来，非荒地不行。离水远的亮开窑，下一指抢晌雨也能下种，一天不下雨一天要斗争。”组织评选过程中，注意掌握积极因素克服消极因素，从表扬节省会过时光中，来克服割韭菜大吃二喝浪费现象，发扬点种积极斗争思想，克服等雨消极思想。现全村虽在紧张的麦收中，但仍继续担水点种、抢救棉花苗，进行亮窑，饭市上看不到一个吃白面的。（尚亭）
    【本报涉县讯】神头栽花后，提出防旱备荒，大家劲头不大，后来回头将栽棉总结了一下，选出了八个英雄模范，其中最好的是冯子敬，自己栽了一亩，还动员帮助别人往远地担水。申二台是懒汉变成肯劳动了，在总结会上，申二台说：“我以前是个懒汉，今后一定要改，并要生产节约，细水长流。”这样一来，大家才热烈的讨论抗旱备荒工作，群众一致的说：“咱们今后一定俭省，全村算了一下，光从本村买酒买烟就消耗二百五十万零二千四百元，按市价折米八十六石六斗。这样群众更认清了抗旱节约的重要，提出口号：“死人不出孝，结婚不请亲戚、不坐轿。”因此生产节约成了运动。（崇智）
