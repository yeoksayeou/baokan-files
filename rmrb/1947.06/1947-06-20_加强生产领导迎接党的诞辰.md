　　Strengthen Production Leadership to Greet the Party's Birthday
　　[This newspaper, Shexian News] In order to greet the Party's birthday on July 1st, under the slogan of "Presenting gifts to the Party with practical work," the First District resolutely deepened leadership and launched a meritorious service campaign to promote production work. A meeting was specially held on June 12th to study this issue. Based on the situation in the entire district, three types of villages were divided for leadership: The first type is seven villages including Shentou. These villages have a relatively strong foundation in production work, but still need to be further improved. The future direction is: District and village cadres should personally lead, deeply create typical experiences to promote the overall situation, village leaders should promote the method of collective leadership, give play to the creativity of the masses, establish new leadership styles, cultivate new and old heroes, improve the quality of mutual assistance in production technology, and further create complete methods of the three major combinations.
　　The second type is nine villages including Huy峪. The central task of these villages is to mobilize liberated peasants for large-scale production. The future direction is: to enlighten cadres' conscious leadership thinking, conduct education on production as the second revolution, and on this basis, extensively mobilize liberated peasants to organize, overcome the old style of small-scale operations, and be sure to lead with both points and surfaces.
　　The third type is eight villages including Huili. Land reform is not yet thorough, peasants have not yet been completely liberated, and landlords still have considerable economic and political power. The future direction is to focus on production, combined with re-examination and adjustment of the relationship between cadres and the masses, transform the branch, establish a leadership core with poor and hired peasants, develop Party members, and strengthen the Party's strength. All three types of villages need to solve problems through meritorious service models, and completely combine the meritorious service of the branch and the masses to promote drought resistance and conservation work. The district leadership has also re-allocated forces, with the Huy峪 base focusing on a concentrated attack on Huy峪 village, the Henan Dian base focusing on Yantouling, the Chikan base focusing on Huili and Qu, and the Shentou base focusing on Shentou and Yangjiashan. After the meeting, everyone was in high spirits and determined to achieve results before "July 1st" to present gifts to the Party's birthday. (Chong Zhi, Qing Rong)

　　加强生产领导迎接党的诞辰
    【本报涉县讯】一区在迎接七一党的生日，拿实际工作给党送礼的口号下，坚决深入领导，开展立功运动推动生产工作，特于六月十二日集会专门研究这一问题、根据全区情况分了三个类型村进行领导：第一类是神头等七个村。这类村的生产工作比较有基础，但尚须继续提高。今后的方针是：区村干部要亲自领导，深入创造典型经验推动全面，村的领导要发扬集体领导的方法，发挥群众的创造性，从中树立新的领导作风，培养新、老英雄，提高生产技术互助质量，进一步创造完整的三大结合办法。
    第二类是胡峪等九个村，这类村中心是发动翻身农民大生产，今后的方针是：启发干部自觉的领导思想，进行生产是第二个革命的教育，在此基础上大量的发动翻身农民组织起来，克服小手小脚的老作风，一定要有点有面的去领导。
    第三类是会里等八个村，土地改革还不彻底，农民还未彻底翻身，地主在经济、政治上还有相当势力。今后的方针是以生产为主结合复查与调整干群关系，改造支部，树立贫雇为核心领导，发展党员，壮大党的力量。以上三类村都是要从立功表模中来解决问题，和支部群众的立功完全结合起来，推动抗旱节约工作。区领导上又重新配备了力量，胡峪基点集中突击胡峪村，河南店基点搞沿头岭后，赤岸基点搞会里和曲＠，神头基点搞神头、杨家山。会后大家情绪很高，决心在“七一”前做出成绩，给党的生日送礼。（崇智、庆荣）
