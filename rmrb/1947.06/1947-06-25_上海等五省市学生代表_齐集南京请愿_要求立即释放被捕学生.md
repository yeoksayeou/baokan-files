　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Shanghai News: Nanjing Xinmin Bao reports: A delegation consisting of 23 people from the Shanghai Student Union and families of arrested students in Shanghai arrived in Nanjing on June 16th. They met with reporters to report on the situation of 133 students being blacklisted and arrested. The delegation has joined representatives from student unions in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan, and will jointly petition the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, and the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, demanding the immediate release of arrested students and the cessation of arrests.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Shanghai News: Chiang Kai-shek's military police have unreasonably forced the dissolution of the "Shanghai Student Union" and the "Nanjing Student Union" on the grounds that "the associations have not registered with the competent authorities and are therefore not in compliance with the law." The general public believes that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "law" has long been abandoned by the people. Chiang Kai-shek's move clearly cannot truly dissolve the great student union against civil war and famine, just as the so-called "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" cannot stop student parades and demonstrations.

　　上海等五省市学生代表
    齐集南京请愿
    要求立即释放被捕学生
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】沪息：南京新民报载：上海学生联合会与上海被捕学生家属共二十三人组成之代表团，于六月十六日抵南京，招待记者，报告一百三十三个学生被列入黑名单及被拘捕情形。该代表团已与南京、上海、江苏、浙江、河南五区之学生联合会代表会合，将联同向蒋记行政院、立法院、司法院、监察院与参政会驻会委员会请愿，要求立即释放被捕学生及停止逮捕。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】沪息：蒋家宪警已无理强迫解散“上海市学生联合会”与“南京学生联合会”，理由为“该会迄未向主管当局办理登记，于法不合”云云。一般人士认为，蒋介石的什么“法”早被人民所撇弃了，蒋介石此举显然并不能真正解散学生反内战反饥饿的大联合，正如所谓“维持社会秩序临时办法”并不能制止学生的游行示威一样。
