(This report) From our newspaper in Wu'an: Cadres in various districts of Wu'an have launched a "July 1st" merit competition, deeply expanding drought resistance and famine relief efforts. The Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Districts held joint meetings respectively, recognizing the difficulties and overcoming complacency. They are focusing on production and conservation to resist drought and overcome famine, preparing for a major counter-offensive to earn merit for the Party. The meetings began by examining the personal production and conservation plans of the cadres, then examining how they led in the villages, and what new developments occurred in the mass line within the movement. The examination of the cadres mainly involved raising class consciousness through comparisons with the fighting at the front, comparisons before and after liberation, and comparisons of past famines with the present situation. Everyone agreed that if the rear doesn't conserve, who will? If we don't conserve now, when will we? Without revolutionary victory, there will be no individual interests! Therefore, they voluntarily reported reducing the burden on the public. Most cadres saved on their salaries and clothing for the second half of the year, and many comrades turned over their personal savings to the public. Thirty-eight comrades in the Fifth District saved and turned over 1,383,090 yuan to the public. They also have a sufficient understanding of the current difficulties. The drought has already occurred; it is no longer about drought prevention and famine preparation, but about drought resistance and famine relief. At the same time, we must prepare for a major counter-offensive. Modern warfare consumes a lot; a careful calculation in each village will reveal the difficulties. To defeat Chiang Kai-shek and eradicate the roots of feudalism, we must overcome our financial and food difficulties. The masses are newly emancipated, and they have not yet established a firm foundation. Developing production and encountering famine will naturally create more difficulties. However, there are also favorable conditions: the masses have past experience and lessons in overcoming famine, understand the pain of famine, and are easily self-aware. At the same time, the masses are highly conscious, and their enthusiasm for production to establish a prosperous foundation after emancipation is high. Furthermore, there are cadres, Party members, and activists taking the lead in leadership, which can be organized to overcome famine. From recent experience, the following problems have been discovered: 1. Recalling famines, calculating detailed accounts, and formulating conservation plans are the main tasks. The masses' thinking initially is complacency and a fluke. From recalling famines and calculating detailed accounts, it develops into panic and fear, and finally rises up in struggle. After the leadership breaks complacency, it should greatly shorten the time of fear and panic, and quickly shift to drought resistance actions. 2. The masses look at the cadres, and the middle peasants look at the poor peasants. We should clarify our class viewpoint, unite with the middle peasants with the poor and hired peasants as the main force, and break the various ideological concerns of the middle peasants. 3. Mobilize the masses to educate each other, commend the active, and reward those who respond to the government's call. And pay special attention to mobilizing women, because women are in charge of the cooking pot, etc. After the meeting, cadres from various districts formulated conditions, proposed calls, and drafted outlines, preparing to perform meritorious service for the Party on July 1st to celebrate its birthday.

[Another Report] The village cadres and team leaders of Hedong Village held a meeting and decided to strengthen conservation and famine preparation, and to present a gift to the Party on "July 1st". The cadres present were in high spirits and put forward plans for conservation and famine preparation, automatically abstaining from alcohol and cigarettes, reducing consumption of white flour, and lowering their living standards. Finally, the production director summarized everyone's opinions and said: "Before 'July 1st', we must achieve a daily saving of two liang of millet per person, the whole village must complete 10,000 jin of preserved vegetables, hoe over 600 mu of seedlings within ten days, each man must plant ten melon seedlings, and women must spin four jin of thread. Eat a bowl of noodle soup in ten days and achieve 'replace liquor with tobacco,' and cornmeal mixed with bran." Finally, he called on everyone, saying: "If we all achieve this by 'July 1st', we will have given a gift to the Communist Party." (Pu Nong)

　　武安各区干部迎接“七一”
    加强抗旱备荒领导
    【本报武安讯】武安各区掀起七一立功竞赛，深入扩大开展抗旱渡荒运动。三、五、六、七、八、十等区分别召开联席会议，认识困难打破麻痹，生产节约抗旱渡荒，准备大反攻为党立功。会中首先检查干部个人的生产节约计划，然后检查如何在村里领导，以及群众路线在运动中有何新发展。对干部的检查，主要是从与前方作战对比，解放前后对比，过去灾荒与现在对比当中提高了阶级觉悟，一致认为后方不节约叫谁节约，现在不节约啥时节约，没有革命胜利，那有个人利益！于是纷纷自报减轻公家负担，大部干部节约下半年津贴衣物，并有很多同志把个人积蓄交公。五区三十八个同志节约生产交公一三八三○九○元，对当前困难也都有了足够认识，旱灾已成，现在已不是防旱备荒，而是抗旱渡荒了。同时准备大反攻，现代化的大战争消耗大，各村仔细一计算就会明白困难。要战胜蒋介石刨封建老根，必须克服我们的财粮困难。群众又是新翻身，没扎上根开展生产、遇见荒年困难自然更多。但亦有有利条件；群众有过去渡荒经验教训，明白灾荒痛苦容易自觉。同时群众觉悟高，翻身后发家栽富根的生产热情高，又有干部党员积极分子带头领导，可以组织起来战胜灾荒。从最近一段经验已发现以下几个问题：一、忆灾荒算细帐订节约计划是主要的。群众思想开始是麻痹、侥幸，从忆灾荒算细帐发展到恐慌害怕，最后起来斗争。领导上把麻痹打破后，应大大缩短害怕恐慌时间，迅速转入抗旱行动。二、群众看干部，中农看贫农，应明确阶级观点，以贫雇为主团结中农，打破中农的种种思想顾虑。三、发动群众相互教育，表扬积极，奖励响应政府号召的。并特别注意到动员妇女，因为妇女是掌锅过时光的等。会谈后各区干部纷纷订条件、提号召、拟纲领，准备七一立功为党祝寿。（林）
    【又讯】河东村村干小组长集会决定加强节约备荒“七一”给党送礼。到会干部情绪极高，纷纷提出节约备荒计划，自动戒酒戒纸烟，减吃白面，降低生活。最后生产主任总结大家意见说：“在‘七一’以前要做到每天每人节约小米二两，全村完成一万斤湿菜，十天内锄完六百余亩小苗，每个男人点种十棵瓜，妇女纺线四斤，十天吃顿汤面，做到“去酒变烟”，玉茭面拌糠。”最后他号召大家说：“到‘七一’那天我们如果都做到了，就是给共产党送到了礼。”（仆农）
