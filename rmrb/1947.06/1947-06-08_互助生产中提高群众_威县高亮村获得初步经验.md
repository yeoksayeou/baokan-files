The following experiences have been gained in mobilizing and organizing the masses for production in Gaoliang Village, Weixian County: 1. Breaking down ideological obstacles and emphasizing organization should be combined, and ideological obstacles should be further cleared through action, which is more likely to be effective. At the beginning of the movement, only mobilization was emphasized, but no practical results were seen after a day and a night. Later, it was started by organizing cadres for mutual aid production, which quickly increased the production enthusiasm of the whole village. When the cadres gained the benefits and experience of mutual aid, it became easier to organize the masses. 2. Mutual aid should progress from a lower level to a higher level, proposing to meet people first and then deal with work, do today's work, and arrange tomorrow's work. Some mutual aid methods and difficulties should be studied and solved in the process of mutual aid, which is more effective than empty talk about the benefits and organization methods of mutual aid. 3. The content of mutual aid and exchange of labor should be inspired by the masses to freely discuss and arrange. Initially, the leadership emphasized planting and weeding. People who did not have this kind of work felt that there was no need for mutual aid. Later, the masses were allowed to freely combine and discuss freely. As a result, some proposed planting, and some proposed cutting grass to feed cattle. Those who did not have urgent work proposed to record work points and return labor, so that the mutual aid organization could be well established.

This newspaper’s Jinan Dispatch, 6th.—After the county-wide cadre mobilization meeting in Jize on May 10th, the whole county rushed to cultivate and plant for ten days. Now 150,000 mu of land have been sown, with an average of 1.5 mu per person. The main reasons for achieving the above results are: 1. District and village cadres enthusiastically lead and take the lead in going to the fields. For example, District Chief Li of the Third District helped the masses of Futudian pull plows to sow, which influenced the masses to say: "We should work harder." After all the cadres of Wang Shuangta went to the fields, they promoted the production of the whole village. 2. Some of the female labor force was organized. For example, Lian Ziniang and other 25 women from Wu Guanying contracted 14 mu of land for orphans and widows. Seventy-five women participated in digging the Xinglong Ditch. In Xiliu Village, 17 women and men worked together to irrigate and sow fields. After the county committee convened a meeting on the 21st to inspect production, it instructed each district: (1) Continue to mobilize all men, women, old and young to invest in production, not idling a single labor force, and ensure that an average of 2 mu of autumn seedlings per person are sown before wheat harvest. (2) Organize the exchange of labor between people and livestock to help with the wheat harvest. The slogan is "Reap and gather cleanly, do not lose a single grain of wheat."

　　互助生产中提高群众
    威县高亮村获得初步经验
    【本报冀南六日电】威县高亮村在发动与组织群众生产上，获得以下经验：一、打破了思想障碍就强调组织起来，从行动中继续打通思想，两者紧相结合才易收效。运动开始时，只强调动员结果，一天一夜未见实效，后来便先从组织干部互助生产入手，很快的提高了全村生产热情，当干部得到互助的好处和经验后，组织群众也就比较容易了。二、互助要有低级到高级，提出先碰人后碰活，作着今天的活，安排明天的活，一些互助办法和难题在互助作活中去研究解决，这样比空谈互助好处与组织办法易收效。三、互助变工生产的内容，要启发群众自由讨论安排，最初领导上曾强调点种、锄苗，没有这类活的人就觉得无互助的必要，后来放手让群众自愿结合自由讨论，于是有的提点种，有的提出割草喂牛，没有紧生活的就提出作活要记工、还工，这样互助组织才能很好的建立起来。
    【本报冀南六日电】五月十日，鸡泽全县干部动员大会后，全县抢耕抢种十天，现已有十五万亩土地完成下种，平均每人达到一亩半，获得以上成绩主要由于：一、区村干部热情领导，亲自带头下地。如三区李区长帮助浮图店群众拉耧下种，影响的群众说：“咱们更该加劲干。”王双塔干部全部下地后，推动了全村生产。二、部分组织了妇女劳动力，如吴官营妇女莲子娘等二十五人，揽孤寡地十四亩，七十五个妇女曾参加挖兴隆沟。西柳村有十七个妇女和男人一齐浇田下种。县委会于二十一日集会检查生产后，指示各区：（一）继续动员所有男女老幼投入生产，不闲一个人力，保证麦前完成平均每人二亩秋苗下种。（二）组织人畜变工换工，互助麦收，其口号是“割净拾净，不丢掉一粒麦。”
