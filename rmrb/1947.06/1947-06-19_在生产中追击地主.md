　　Pursuing Landlords in Production

　　Recently, in the deeply developing production and economy movement, one thing deserves enough vigilance. This matter is that some overthrown landlords are actually disrupting this production and self-salvation movement, which is related to the whole district's people overcoming difficulties and living a good life. Everyone is carrying out production and economy, but they spread rumors, encouraging others not to economize and not to work. This fact shows us that although we have overthrown the landlords in the land reform movement, some have not been knocked down to the point where they cannot stand up again, and have not completely bowed their heads to the peasants, still constantly looking for opportunities to counterattack. Therefore, mobilizing the masses to continue to investigate feudalism, in many places, should not only be paid attention to, but also needs to be done. The discovery in Tinghepu that the poor peasants' debts have not been filled, the landlords are still eating well and living well, and some even, acting as cadres, spread rumors and sabotage, immediately seizing the gap in sowing, continuing to settle accounts, and sweeping away the feudal remnants, is worthy of learning from all places. The view in individual places that engaging in production means that feudalism cannot be pursued, or neglecting to discover problems in production, is incorrect.

### 在生产中追击地主

　　在生产中追击地主
    最近在生产节约运动深入发展中，有一件事值得引起足够的警惕。这件事就是某些被斗地主竟然活动破坏这个有关全区人民克服困难过好生活的生产自救运动，大家都在进行生产节约，他却散布谣言，鼓动别人不节约不劳动。这个事实让我们看出，我们在土地改革运动中，虽已将地主打倒在地，但有些还未打得站不起来，还未打得完全向农民低头，仍然时时刻刻找空子进行反攻。因之，发动群众继续追查封建，在不少地方不但应该注意，而且需要这样做。停河铺发现贫农窟窿未填起，地主仍吃的好住的好，甚至还有的当着干部，造谣破坏，即抓住下种空隙，继续清算，扫清了封建尾巴，是值得各地学习的。个别地方认为搞生产即不能继续追击封建，或在生产中忽视发现问题，那是不正确的。
