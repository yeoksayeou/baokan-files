Even elderly men over 60, such as Hou Yongchou and Hou Tingzhu, who do not participate in mutual aid, and nine-year-old children participated in the canal construction. Hou Zuodong and others locked their doors and the whole family helped each other repair the canal. Women like Guo Aiying, Wang Zhiying, and Huo Yingge also took off their socks and went into the water to dredge the canal.

They have now repaired four canals, reaching nine li in length, and three waterwheels can irrigate 1,900 mu of land. Eighty-seven women and children in Yanzhuang Village also organized and built two canals, each four and a half li long, two and a half chi wide and deep, and a water pond 150 chi long, five chi wide, and four chi high, which can irrigate more than 200 mu of land in five days. Yangcheng's First District has planted more than 8,500 mu.
