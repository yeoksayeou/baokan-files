    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, June 2nd] Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: The renowned hero in killing the enemy, Zheng Facheng, performed another great feat in the battle to capture Nanguan. He led the heroic Fourth Platoon, which had won the Column's award banner in the West Platform Village battle, to carry out the assault. They crossed a moat more than a foot wide and deep, ascended the city walls in just two minutes, and captured multiple street strongholds, with no casualties in the entire platoon. The League Committee awarded him a major merit on the front lines. The next day, the brigade leader personally wrote a letter and sent personnel with gifts to express their condolences and take photos to celebrate his achievement. Zheng Facheng had already been promoted to platoon leader. His main characteristics in command are secrecy, composure, resourcefulness, and speed. In the West Platform Village battle, he captured eight light and heavy machine guns and forty-three rifles from the Chiang Kai-shek troops holding the fortifications with only six men.
