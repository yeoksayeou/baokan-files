　　Jinpu Northern Section Continues to Capture Cangxian County
    Beining and Pinghan Lines Cut into Several Sections by Our Army
    [New China News Agency Jinpu Front, Urgent Telegram, 11:00 AM, 15th] The Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army, launching a strong offensive on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, liberated Cangxian County, a commercial hub on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, at dawn today (15th); the entire puppet Hebei Security 6th Column garrisoning the city was annihilated. Thus, nearly 200 li of the railway line on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, from Jiedi in the south to Chenguantun in the north, is completely under the control of the People's Liberation Army. The Jin-Cha-Ji and Bohai liberated areas have been connected into one vast area. The offensive is continuing to develop.
    [New China News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, Urgent Telegram, Midnight, 15th] A unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army cut the Beining Railway between Yangcun and Luofa (northwest of Tianjin), and between Chadian and Hanzhan (northeast of Tianjin) on the night of the 12th. On the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the Caohe Railway Bridge, 20 li north of Baoding, was also blown up. The three major arteries of Pinghan, Jinpu, and Beining, on which the Chiang army relies to maintain Ping, Tianjin, and Baoding, have all been severed.
    [New China News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th] In May, local troops and militia in the Central Hebei and Jin-Sui areas cooperated with the main forces in launching active attacks, operating around Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and the Ping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle. A total of more than 80 battles were fought, recovering 27 large and small villages and towns within about 100 li of the periphery of Taiyuan, including Shihe, Pingtou, Taian, Yixia, Shitie, and Beicai, Gongcun, Cicun, and Gongyizhuang, which belong to Gu'an County, more than 100 li south of Beiping. A total of more than 4,100 enemy troops, including Yan's army's Security 4th Regiment, Independent Column, and Chiang's Ba County, Xincheng, and other puppet security teams, were killed, wounded, or captured, including more than 2,500 captured alive, including Liu Fengquan, deputy commander of Chiang's Ba County Security, and below. One mortar, two 60mm mortars, 73 grenade launchers, 65 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 1,280 rifles and carbines were seized. The enemy-to-us situation in the Ping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle has greatly changed. Chiang's major strongholds such as Gu'an and Shengfang and Wangqingtuo in western Tianjin are completely isolated, and Chiang's forces in Ping and Tianjin are deeply threatened.

　　津浦北段续克沧县
    北宁平汉两线被我军斩为数段
    【新华社津浦前线十五日上午十一时急电】向津浦北段发动强大攻势之晋察冀人民解放军，于今日（十五日）拂晓解放津浦北段商业重镇沧县城；盘据该城之伪河北保安第六纵队全部被歼。至此，津浦北段南至捷地北迄陈官屯间近二百余华里之铁路线，已完全为人民解放军所控制。晋察冀、渤海两解放区，已在宽广地带联成一片。刻攻势仍在继续发展中。
    【新华社晋察冀十五日午夜急电】晋察冀人民解放军一部，于十二日夜将北宁路杨村至落垡间（天津西北），及茶淀、汉沾间（天津东北）铁路切断。平汉北段方面，保定北二十里之漕河大铁桥亦被炸毁。蒋军赖以维持平津保之平汉、津浦、北宁三大动脉已全被斩断。
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】五月份冀中、冀晋两区地方部队、民兵配合主力作战，展开主动出击，活跃于太原、石家庄周围及平津保三角地带，总计作战八十余次，收复距太原外围约百里以内之石河、坪头、太安、驿下、什贴及北平南方百余里固安县属之北蔡、宫村、茨村、公义庄等大小村镇二十七处，共毙伤俘阎军保安四团独立纵队及蒋记霸县、新城等伪保安团队四千一百余名，其中生俘蒋记霸县保安副司令刘凤泉以下二千五百余名；缴臼炮一门，六零炮二门，掷弹筒七十三个，轻重机枪六十五挺，步马枪一千二百八十余支。现平、津、保三角地带之敌我形势已大大改变，固安及津西之胜芳、王庆坨等蒋伪大据点，完全陷于孤立，平津蒋伪已深感威胁。
