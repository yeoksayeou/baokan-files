Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: TASS Delhi dispatch: The Free Press Journal here commented on the British plan for the partition of India, saying: "What a brazen lie it is for Britain to claim that they are letting the Indian people decide their own destiny! If one recalls the plan that Britain itself drafted a year ago for the future of India on the principle of unity, Britain's hypocrisy becomes even more evident. India cannot expect anything else from Britain. It would be extremely foolish to hope for "altruism" from imperialist powers and to beg for such hopes to be realized. For those who have been at the forefront of the liberation movement, it is a most shameful thing to declare that India will be divided." The newspaper demanded that the Indian Congress Party should reject this plan and announce to Britain that the Indian people will never allow any plan to be imposed on them. The newspaper also warned the Congress leaders not to trifle with the fate of 400 million Indians. The newspaper emphasized that the people must fight for a unified India.

　　印度报纸要求尼赫鲁等
    摈斥英国分治计划
    强调为统一的印度而奋斗
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社德里讯：此间自由新闻纪事报评论英国对印度分治计划称：“英国宣称他们让印度人自己决定自己的命运，这是多么无耻的谎言呵！假如人们回忆一下一年前英国自己在统一的原则上曾对印度的将来草拟了计划，那么英国的伪善就变得更显明了。印度不能使英国希望别的事了，对帝国主义强国希望“利他主义”，而哭求那么实现的希望，会是极愚蠢的。对于那些在解放运动中曾作过先锋的人来说，宣称印度将被分裂，是一件最耻辱不过的事情。”该报要求印度委员会大会应该摈斥此项计划，向英国宣布印度人民决不让任何计划强加在他们头上。该报同时警告大会领袖们不应拿四万万印度人的命运当作儿戏。该报强调称：人民必须为统一的印度而奋斗。
