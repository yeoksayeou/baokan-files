　　Equal Pay for Equal Work and Timely Settlement of Accounts
    Mutual Aid Consolidated and Weeding Enthusiastic
    Su Dian in Changzhi Summarizes the Experience of Changing Labor
    [Reported by our newspaper from Changzhi] After rectifying mutual aid and solving the problems of mutual aid, Su Dian has formed a high tide of pulling millet and weeding. In order to exchange experiences and consolidate mutual aid, a meeting of cadres and mutual aid group leaders was held on the 15th of this month. Zhang Fazhe said: "Our group has seventeen households. In the past, we weren't very motivated. Everyone was good at talking during meetings, but when working, we all worked separately. Later, I heard Wang Heze say behind my back, 'We don't have livestock, and we don't have shares in the village. We don't have shares in the ten mu of cantaloupe planted by the mutual aid group, and we can't share the dividends. Who are we working for?' Then we held a mutual aid discussion meeting and expanded the shareholders. Since then, everyone's enthusiasm has increased." Cui Quancheng said: "Our group has twelve households. When we planted corn for Chou Ren, four women and I went to the fields early in the morning before it was light, and didn't come back to eat until late in the afternoon. We planted ten mu of corn, but each person was only counted for four days of work. Everyone was unhappy because they didn't get extra work points for the extra work they did. After discussion, everyone got an extra day of work points, and everyone's morale immediately changed." Bi Eryun said: "Our group has six women in charge of pulling millet these days. The remaining one full laborer, with a livestock, grinds flour and sells flour; one full laborer with one half laborer and two livestock pulls coal and sells coal; the remaining five full laborers and one half laborer weed and water the garden. After calculating the accounts, we have earned more than 70,000 yuan in dividends these days. The whole group has 31 mu of millet, 5 mu of dense millet and 26 mu of sparse millet. Dense millet is counted as four tenths of a work point, and sparse millet is counted as five tenths of a work point. For every tenth of an acre of extra millet pulled, an extra tenth of a work point is counted. Each work point is worth seven and a half catties of rice. Sister-in-law Eryun pulls millet very quickly. She pulled one mu in one day and was counted for two work points, earning an extra seven and a half catties of rice, which she doesn't have to hand over to her family. With this method of evaluating work based on the work done, everyone's morale is very high." Qin Guize said: "Our group has thirteen households, eight women pulling millet. The millet is contracted out to the women according to the density of the millet. Dense millet is 15 catties per mu, and sparse millet is 13 catties per mu. Everyone is also very willing to do it." In the warm discussion, everyone realized that equal value change of labor can consolidate mutual aid. Everyone is determined to better organize the full and half laborers to divide the work during the wheat harvest. At the same time, the whole village will clear the change of labor accounts from the previous period, those who should get rice will get rice, and those who owe work points will hand over rice. This rectification greatly improved everyone's understanding of mutual aid. Before the rectification, there were only 14 good groups out of the 36 groups in the village, and the remaining 20 groups were not motivated. After the rectification, the whole village became 42 groups, and everyone was very motivated. It is estimated that the wheat harvest, millet weeding, and corn planting will all be completed by the tenth day of the fifth lunar month. (Lin Tang, Han Qing, You Xue)
