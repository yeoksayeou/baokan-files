Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th (Delayed) After the anti-hunger, anti-civil war parade of students at Shandong University in Qingdao was brutally suppressed by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, all the students, in a fit of indignation, established the "June 2nd Tragedy Aftermath Committee" to persist in the struggle. On June 4th, they printed a letter to all citizens of the city, appealing for assistance, and painfully recounted the incident, stating: This anti-civil war, anti-hunger parade was unanimously passed by the majority of students, and it was decided that the action would only begin if more than half of the students participated. However, on the morning of June 2nd, the area near the two institutes (院) was filled with military police and secret agents, and the telephones had been cut off, making communication impossible. Especially near the second institute, there were students from Guohua Middle School (children of exiled landlords) everywhere, who had received instructions to seize the school buildings as soon as the students from the second institute took action. At that time, the students from the first institute gathered at the school gate, waiting for news from the second and third institutes. They also posted slogans, distributed leaflets, and sang anti-civil war songs. The presidium, including Shi Boyu and three others, went to the Lushankou intersection to negotiate with the martial law military police, but were unreasonably arrested. Propaganda team members Liu Guanwen and two others were also arrested while taking photos near the school gate. When the news came, the crowd was outraged and unanimously demanded that a petition be made to the authorities to release the arrested students. Principal Zhao strongly opposed this, and no immediate action was taken. Later, Director Gao of the life guidance team went to the Garrison Headquarters for negotiations, but by noon there was no progress, and the students became even more agitated. They gathered in the auditorium to discuss the matter and unanimously passed a resolution to petition the Garrison Headquarters, protesting the unreasonable arrest of students. Professors advised the students to consider, but the students shouted, "We want to die together!" Thus, at 1:00 PM, they formed a line and marched to the Yushan Road intersection. The presidium negotiated, but to no avail. At that time, all roads were blocked by obstacles, and outside the roads, thousands of military police and secret agents were densely packed, rubbing their fists and eager to try. At 4:00 PM, Principal Zhao personally went to the Garrison Headquarters to negotiate the release of the arrested students, and professors joined the student ranks to persuade them. By this time, the students had begun to publicize their cause to the outside world, explaining that the parade was purely out of patriotic enthusiasm and had no party affiliation. However, the secret agents outside still did not change their sinister faces, shouting "Down with the Communist Party," "Shanda is full of traitorous bandits," and hurled insults. The students could not contain their anger and cried out in unison. The citizens who witnessed this could not help but lower their heads and wipe away tears. Then, a member of the Garrison Headquarters spoke to the students, repeatedly stating that "under martial law, parades are not allowed." The petitioning students immediately questioned him with the day's newspaper, asking why a small number of exiled students and "refugees" were able to parade and petition, post slogans, and distribute leaflets against the Shanda parade under the protection of the military police? The officer was momentarily at a loss for words. The military police then cleared the obstacles, blew the charge horn, and came fiercely. The students all held hands, ready for the violence to come. Sure enough, belts and wooden sticks came down on them, and many students were bleeding from their faces and fell to the ground. Female students also had their hair torn out. What was even more infuriating was that Director Gao of the life guidance team came out to dissuade them, but was also beaten. Although he tried his best to say that he was a school teacher, he was still severely beaten, his head was injured, and his face was red and swollen, and his vision has not yet recovered. Finally, more than 140 students were packed into twelve trucks and sent to the First Pacification Zone cadre training class. When they got out of the truck, in the courtyard, in front of the officials, they were kicked and beaten again. Most of the students were prostrate on the ground, leaning on each other, and had long since lost consciousness. Seriously injured students Yang Tanyuan and three others were whipped with belts in the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. The scene was appalling. It was not until after 1:00 AM that Principal Zhao negotiated several times before most of them were released. However, the students were forced to sign a statement admitting "mistakes," and the students all wrote: "Volunteer to participate in the parade to show resistance." After the students were arrested, a large number of secret agents rushed into the school to search, tore up wall posters, smashed school equipment, and arrested students on the "blacklist," and drove more than ten students who remained in the school to the dining hall, where they were subjected to insults. When the students of the First Institute were arrested, the students of the Second and Third Institutes, who were surrounded, were extremely anxious and sent representatives to negotiate several times, but were unreasonably rejected. This is the truth of the "June 2nd Tragedy." The letter expressed a firm determination to fight, saying: "Now we want to cry but have no tears, want to shout but have no voice. The students of the Second and Third Institutes have been fasting and giving the money they saved to the injured students to recuperate. This fully demonstrates that our hearts are tightly united together. Young people cannot be scattered, we will always believe this!" The letter also protested to the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, saying: "Now our Student Union Chairman Shi Boyu and four injured students, including Yang Tanyuan, have not yet been released. The Garrison Headquarters has also forced the reorganization of the Student Union. Why is a military police organ openly interfering in the administration of the highest institution of learning? We demand that the government answer us, demand that the constitution answer us, why use such brutal means to deal with the suffering students? Is it a crime to hope for a ceasefire, to hope for peace, to hope not to use the common people as cannon fodder anymore? ... We demand that the government investigate the brutal murderers, we resolutely protest against this illegal act of violence!"

　　青岛山东大学学生六二游行
    遭蒋党镇压造成惨案
    学生沉痛抗议继续坚持斗争
    【新华社山东二十四日电】（迟到）青岛山东大学学生反饥饿反内战游行，遭蒋党当局残酷镇压后，全体学生激愤之余，特成立“六二惨案善后委员会”，坚持斗争。于六月四日印发告全市同胞书，呼吁援助，沉痛叙述惨案发生的经过称：此次反内战反饥饿游行，是大多数同学一致通过、并决定人数在二分之一以上才开始行动。但在六月二日的清晨，二院附近，都已布满了军警特务，电话早被断绝，无法联络。尤其二院附近，遍布国华中学学生（流亡地主子弟），他们受了指示，准备二院同学一有行动，即强占校舍。当时一院同学齐集校门，静候二、三院消息。同时贴标语，散传单，并高唱反内战歌曲。由主席团石勃瑜等四人到鲁山路口与戒严军警交涉，竟遭无理逮捕。宣传组刘冠文等三人在校门附近摄影，亦遭逮捕。消息传来，群情激愤，一致要求向当局请愿释放被捕同学。经赵校长力阻，未能即时行动。后由生活指导组高主任往警备司令部交涉，至中午一无头绪，同学益形激愤，群集大礼堂商讨，一致通过向警备司令部请愿，抗议无理逮捕同学。教授劝同学们考虑，同学们高呼道：“我们要死到一块去！”遂于下午一时，整队出发至鱼山路口，由主席团交涉，未获结果，时各路均被障碍物所阻塞，路外密布军警特务不下数千人，磨拳擦掌，跃跃欲试。至下午四时，赵校长亲赴警备司令部交涉释放被捕同学问题，教授皆插入同学行列，以便劝求。至此，同学已对外开展宣传，讲述此次游行纯出于爱国热情，毫无党派背景。然外面特务仍不改其狰狞面目，高呼“打倒共产党”，“山大全是奸匪分子”，横加辱骂。同学愤不可抑，齐声痛哭。市民观状，莫不低首拭泪。旋警备司令部派员与同学讲话，口口声声“戒严法下，不准游行”。请愿同学即执当日报纸质问，为何少数流亡学生及“难民”能在军警保护下游行请愿、贴标语、散传单反对山大游行？该员一时不知所答，军警竟拨开障碍物，吹起冲锋号，凶凶而来。同学皆手腕相携，静候暴力降临。果然，皮带木棍，一齐打来，同学多满面流血，跌倒在地。女同学头发亦被撕掉。尤令人气愤者，生活指导组高主任出来劝阻，亦被殴打。虽竭力说彼为学校教师，仍不免毒打，头部受伤，脸部红肿，至今视觉尚未复元。最后，终将同学一百四十余人分装十二辆卡车，送第一绥靖区干训班。下车时，在操场上，当官长面前，又被脚踢殴打，多数同学匍匐地面，互相依枕，早已神志不清。重伤同学杨郯元等四人，在侨务室又被用皮带抽打，其状之惨，令人发指。至深夜一时许，经赵校长数度交涉，始大部被释放。但迫令同学签字承认“过失”，同学均书称：“志愿参加游行以示反抗”。又同学被捕后，大批特务冲入校内搜查，撕毁壁报，捣毁校具，逮捕“黑名单”上所列同学，并将留校十余同学驱集餐庭，备加辱骂。当第一院同学被捕后，被包围中的二、三院同学焦急万分，几次派代表交涉均遭无理拒绝。这是“六二惨案”的真象。该书表明坚决斗争决心谓：“现在我们欲哭无泪，欲呼无声。二、三院的同学，已经绝食把节余下来的钱，给同学养伤。这充分表现我们的心已紧紧团结一起。青年人是打不散的，我们永远这样相信！”该书并向蒋党当局提出抗议谓：“现在尚有我们自治会理事长石勃瑜及杨郯元等四位受伤同学，仍未被释放。警备司令部并强迫改组学生自治会。为什么一个军警机关，竟公然干涉最高学府行政？我们要求政府回答我们，要求宪法回答我们，为什么用这样的残暴手段，对付受难学生？难道希望停战、希望和平、希望不再拿老百姓当炮灰，就是犯罪吗？………我们要求政府查办残暴的凶手，我们坚决抗议这种非法的暴行！”
