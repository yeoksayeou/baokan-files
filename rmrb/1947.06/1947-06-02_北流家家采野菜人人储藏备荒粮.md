(Our newspaper, Licheng) The Beiliu Village Production Committee convened a meeting of all cadres and formulated the first ten-day production and famine relief plan: 1. Launch a concentrated effort to sow seeds, complete the sowing of millet, corn, potatoes, pumpkins, etc., overcome the idea of "people waiting for the weather," and establish the concept of "the weather waiting for people." 2. Each household should collect an average of ten catties of dried vegetables (including tree shoots and wild vegetables) for famine relief. 3. Each household should save an average of one handful of rice per person, saving fifty catties for the whole village in one day, and continue this in the long term. 4. Each person should strive to store an average of two dou of grain for famine relief. After the plan is drawn up, it will be discussed in the mutual aid groups, then the leading role of cadres and heroes will be established, and finally, each household will be encouraged to formulate a production and conservation plan. Currently, all male laborers and livestock in the village are rushing to sow seeds, and mutual aid brigades are launching challenges, aiming to finish sowing ahead of schedule. Women and children are collecting wild vegetables in textile groups, with everyone mobilized. On the first day alone, the textile hero Liu Zhongliang's group of twelve women collected three hundred and fifty catties of tree shoots. (Jiang Dong, Guang En, Shu Yu)
(Our newspaper, Licheng) The masses in various villages are actively engaging in production, while also starting to conserve. Nanbu labor hero He Kaoxian called on everyone: "Save food while producing, and save more grain to prepare for famine and kill the enemy." He himself changed from eating rice and noodles to having soup noodles once every five days, mixing some bran into the cornmeal, reducing coarse noodles for dinner, and eating more wild vegetables and leaves, and prohibiting smoking and drinking. Shiban labor hero Yang Shuanhao used the slogan "A steady stream prevents disasters and famines" to convince his family and formulated a conservation plan: change dry noodles to soup noodles, and mix some bran to eat, pay attention to frugality at every meal, and estimate that this year he can save one shi and three dou of rice, one shi and two dou of corn, and four dou of wheat.

　　北流家家采野菜人人储藏备荒粮
    【本报黎城讯】北流村生产委员会召开了全体干部会议，作出了第一个十天生产备荒计划：一、突击下种，要全部完成谷子、玉麦、山药蛋、南瓜等的下种，克服“人等天”的思想，树立“天等人”的观念。二、各家各户每人平均采十斤干菜（包括树头菜及野菜）备荒。三、各家各户每人平均节约一把米，全村一天能省五十斤，并长期继续下去。四、每个人平均争取储藏二斗备荒粮。计划订出后，再到互助组中酝酿，然后树立干部和英雄的带头作用，最后争取各户订出生产节约计划。现该村所有男劳力与畜力全部突击下种，互助大队内纷纷提出挑战，要提前种完。妇女儿童以纺织小组为单位采野菜，全体出动，第一天单纺织英雄刘仲量组十二个妇女，即采树头菜三百五十斤。（江东、广恩、束玉）
    【本报黎城讯】各村群众在积极生产基础上，同时纷纷开始节约。南堡劳英何考贤号召大家：“一面生产一面节约，多省粮食备荒杀敌”。他自己由一米一面改为五天一顿汤面，玉茭中掺点糠，晚饭减去粗面，多吃点野菜树叶，禁绝吸纸烟和喝酒。石板劳英杨拴好用“细水长流防备灾荒”口号打通全家思想，订出节约计划：将干面改为汤面，并掺些糠吃，顿顿注意俭省，估计今年可节省米一石三斗，玉茭一石二斗，麦四斗。
