(Dispatch from the Northern Henan Front, June 17th) The People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng has created experience in battlefield political work and trench life during the Northern Henan Campaign. As the People's Liberation Army's War of National Salvation transitions to the counter-offensive stage, not only has combat become more regularized, but battlefield political work and the daily life of soldiers on the battlefield are also becoming more regularized. In the recent fighting near ××, the construction of defensive works for positional warfare not only facilitates combat but is also suitable for the lives of soldiers. The equipment of various fortifications is neat and complete, and daily activities for soldiers such as learning, meetings, and entertainment can be carried out on time inside the fortifications. The 7th and 8th companies of a certain unit even performed short plays created collectively by soldiers, such as "The Three Alls of the Central Army," "The Great Turnaround of the Peasants," and "Fighting Hu Village," inside the fortifications, and established a "Commanding Platform" in the air-raid shelters for mutual learning. The instructor of the Yi character unit continued to write articles in the trenches in addition to reading newspapers. Comrade Peng Mingchuan, a battalion instructor, completed a communication piece of several thousand words under enemy fire. During the four days of combat, squad leader Tao Ting'en wrote ten articles, both on his own and on behalf of the soldiers. After each battle, a certain company would hold a meeting in the fortifications to review, evaluate merits, and record good deeds. The companies of the Bin character unit even held celebration meetings in fortifications only 300 meters away from the enemy. Representatives from the regimental headquarters traversed the miles-long fortifications to deliver congratulatory letters and supplies to express their congratulations. In addition to political and cultural learning, the 64th unit also set up aiming racks, targets, and grenade throwing targets in the fortifications, combining with the actual combat at the time to familiarize themselves with various actions and improve their skills in a timely manner.

　　豫北我军政治工作继续提高
    战壕生活日益科学化
    【本报豫北前线十七日电】刘伯承将军所部人民解放军在豫北战役中，创造了战地政治工作及战壕生活的经验。人民解放军在爱国自卫战争转入反攻的形势中，不但作战更加正规化，战地政治工作与战地战士生活也日趋正规化。在最近××附近战斗中，阵地战的工事建立上不但利于战斗，而且适合战士生活，各种工事的设备都很整齐完备，学习开会娱乐各项战士日常生活，均可按时在工事内进行。某部七、八连更在工事里出演战士集体创造的《中央军三光》、《农民大翻身》、《打胡庄》短剧和在防空洞里建立点将台，互助学习。毅字部队指导员在战壕里除读报纸外，照常写稿。营教导员彭明川同志，在敌人炮火下完成数千字之通讯稿子。班长陶亭恩在四天的战斗中，自己写和给战士代笔，写稿共十篇。某连每次战斗下来后，均在工事里开会检讨，评功记好。斌字部队各连更在距敌仅三百米的工事里召开庆功会，团部代表穿过长达数里的工事，亲携贺信及慰劳品前往致贺。除政治及文化学习外，六四部队并在工事里设有瞄准架、靶牌及投弹目标，与当时实际战斗结合，熟习各种动作，及时提高技术。（乃一）
