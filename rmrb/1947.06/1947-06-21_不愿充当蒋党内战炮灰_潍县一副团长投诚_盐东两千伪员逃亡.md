Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th. Huang Zhisheng, deputy commander of the 308th Regiment of the Chiang army's 103rd Division in Weixian County, defected to the Jiaodong Liberated Area on May 18th. Huang is from Binyang County, Guangxi, and is 30 years old. He was originally the deputy commander of the Chiang-Gui Lin Garrison Regiment. On February 20th, he was transferred to Qingdao, and on March 15th, he was appointed deputy commander of the 308th Regiment of the Chiang Eighth Army's 103rd Division. Huang expressed a lack of confidence in the civil war at a school officer meeting convened by Li Mi (commander of the Chiang Eighth Army), which led to his detention. He escaped by chiseling through a wall on the evening of May 18th.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th. The "Returning Home Corps'" path-choosing movement in northern Jiangsu, coupled with the great military victories such as the Tongyu Road counterattack, has seen new developments. In Yandong County alone, nearly 1,500 members of the "Returning Home Corps" have returned to the liberated areas in the past two months, and more than 700 people have deserted the Chiang-puppet organizations to go to southern Jiangsu. The Chiang-controlled armed forces and government in four townships, including Tuanyang, in the county have completely disintegrated. In Tuanyang Township, twenty of the twenty-one members of the Chiang-controlled self-defense force deserted in less than a month, and the remaining cook also went home. The Chiang governments in eight townships, including ××, have automatically established relations with the democratic government to leave themselves an out. The democratic government convened a symposium of gentry, earnestly clarified the lenient policy, and launched a "letter writing" campaign. Family members of the fugitives and local elders universally sent letters addressing their living difficulties and homesickness, and enclosed various propaganda materials. After receiving the letters, many members of the "Returning Home Corps" burst into tears. Of the more than 5,000 letters sent by Yandong County, more than 2,000 replies expressed remorse.

    【新华社华中十九日电】苏北各地“还乡团”择路运动，在通榆路反击战等巨大军事胜利配合下，又有新的发展。仅盐（城）东一个县近两个月来已有千五百余还乡团员，重回解放区，七百余人脱离蒋伪组织去江南。该县团阳等四个乡蒋记武装与政权已完全瓦解。团阳乡蒋记自卫队二十一人不到一个月逃亡二十人，余下一个伙夫也回了家。××等八个乡蒋政权自动与民主政府接关系留后路。民主政府召开士绅座谈会，恳切阐明宽大政策，开展“一封信”运动，由逃亡家属地方耆绅针对其生活困难及思家情绪普遍发信，并附寄各种宣传品，“还乡团”接信后，多抱头痛哭，盐东县所发五千余封信，回信表示悔过者达二千封以上。
