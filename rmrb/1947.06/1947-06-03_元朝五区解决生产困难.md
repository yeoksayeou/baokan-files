　　[Report from our Jinnan office, dated the 1st] The Fifth District of Yuanchao has discovered that the main difficulties in production are: firstly, most poor peasants lack farm tools and livestock. According to statistics from Xiaozhai Village, livestock has decreased by more than 45% compared to before 1943. Secondly, there is a conflict between village cadres' work and their own production, and the tasks of tilling land for military families and providing war service are heavy. To resolve the above difficulties, the district: (1) calls for communal feeding of cattle, raising of small livestock, and purchasing of oxen and donkeys for breeding to solve the livestock problem. In Houliusheng Village, out of 31 livestock, 17 are communally fed, accounting for more than half of the village. According to statistics from this spring, the entire district has a total of 292 donkey and cattle calves, of which at least 250 can be raised. Secondly, it establishes central cooperatives to solve the problem of agricultural implements. The village federation in Xifuji is clearly designated to serve agriculture. It first establishes small-scale woodworking factories to make handles, looms, spinning wheels, small flat carts, etc., and then purchases iron goods such as sickles, plowshares, plowshares and iron spades from outside, selling them to members at 10% below market prices. (2) Regarding the production of village cadres, district cadres must change their style of work in the future, hold fewer meetings, and help village cadres solve practical problems more. On the other hand, they will educate village cadres on how to engage in production, such as village cadres taking shifts, which has been tried out in Pingtou Village with good results. Alternatively, they can hold meetings and work in the evenings, completing the day's work at night. (3) In addition to those who must be helped with tilling, military families should be educated and encouraged to actively engage in production themselves to reduce the need for assistance. (4) When facing war tasks, if one person goes out, the entire group will take care of their responsibilities. Mutual assistance and labor exchange will enable those participating in the war to be at ease and complete their tasks.

　　元朝五区解决生产困难
    【本报冀南一日电】元朝五区发现生产的主要困难，一是大部贫农缺乏农具牲畜，按小寨一村牲口统计，与一九四三年前比较，减少百分之四十五强。二是村干工作与本身生产矛盾，军属代耕与战勤支差任务繁重。区上为解放以上困难，（一）号召伙喂牛、养小牲口、买牛驴种，解决牲口困难，后刘胜一村三十一个牲口，伙喂的有十七个，占全村半数以上。全区今春统计有犊的驴、牛共二百九十二个，最少可养成二百五十个。其次、成立中心合作社，解决农具问题，将西付集的村联社，明确为农业服务，首先建立小型木工厂，作＠把、织布机、纺花车，小平车等，再从外边贩买镰刀、犁镜子、犁滑、滑子、铁＠等铁货，低于市价百分之十卖给社员。（二）村干生产方面，区干今后要转变作风，少开会多帮助村干解决实际问题，另方面教育村干从事生产办法，如村干分班值日，平头村已试行，成绩不错。或者晚上集会办公，把一天的工作留在晚上作完。（三）军属生产除必须代耕者外，教育奖励军属自己积极生产，减少代耕。（四）遇战任务时，一人出去，全组照顾。互助变工，使参战者能在外安心，完成任务。
