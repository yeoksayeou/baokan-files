Comrades from Squads 1, 4, and 5 harvest four mu of wheat in half a day. The entire platoon helped the masses harvest 13 mu of wheat, water the gardens five times, and thresh the grain three times in three days. After the commendation meeting, Wang Deming, the supply department's messenger, and Zhao Zhenshan, the feeder, worked even harder, helping poor households harvest wheat every day. After morning training, the Fourth Squad of the Ninth Company immediately mobilized the entire squad to help the villagers harvest wheat, working until 12 o'clock. Thirteen people harvested a total of four mu of wheat. On the same day, they also daubed the landlord's house with mud after dinner. The machine gun squad of the Eighth Company of the 880th Unit fills the water tanks every day before dawn and sweeps the streets clean. While stationed in × location, they helped the landlord harvest four mu of wheat, which greatly moved the masses.
	[Our newspaper's dispatch from the Yubei Front] A small detachment of the Fourth District of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, taking advantage of breaks in combat, helped the masses in villages near Cuijiaqiao, east of Anyang, harvest wheat and water the fields. Under the cruel rule of Wang Ziquan, the local people's property was sucked dry. After our People's Liberation Army liberated them, they began to actively produce again, but they lacked manpower and livestock. Seeing this tragic situation, our small detachment took advantage of breaks in combat to help the masses harvest wheat and do odd jobs. In 25 days, they helped the masses harvest 33 mu of wheat, water 21 mu of fields, push 250 cartloads of manure, carry 1,799 loads of water, pave 1.5 mu of threshing ground, sprinkle water on streets and courtyards 243 times, help grind seven *shi* of grain, push 42 cartloads of adobe for wall building, and give haircuts to 16 people, and chop 205 *jin* of straw.
