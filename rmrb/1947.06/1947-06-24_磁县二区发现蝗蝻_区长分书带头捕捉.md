The villages of Dongliu’er and Taiping in the east and north have also reported discoveries. The affected area is very large. Upon hearing the news, the district office and the district head and secretary immediately went to the Kaihe area to mobilize the masses to catch and kill the locusts. The masses from Nankaihe, Beikaihe, Sanlixiang, and other villages jointly gathered south of Shaying Village to catch and kill the locusts. A total of 1,940 people participated.
