【Reported from Shexian by our newspaper】Since the Eighth District widely mobilized in early June to welcome "July 1st" and launch a major campaign to contribute merits as a gift, all villages in the district have been acting vigorously. In each village, Party branch members and liberated peasants serve as the backbone, recalling the benefits of liberation to further enhance the masses' class consciousness and strengthen the close relationship between the Communist Party and the people. A campaign to strive for a major contribution before July 1st to celebrate the Party's birthday is sweeping across the villages.

　　Dong'anjie convened mass meetings of Party members, cadres, poor peasant activists (both male and female activists from the production and rent reduction movement) around June 5th for extensive mobilization and discussion. At these meetings, after posing the questions "Who did we rely on to achieve liberation? Who enabled us to live a good life?", the masses eagerly spoke. Wang Xi said, "In the past, I didn't have a single plot of land. I rented a few mu of land from the landlord, and the grain I harvested in a year was only enough to pay the rent. I had nothing to eat, and I even gave one of my grandsons to someone else. I didn't have half a broken house and lived in a dilapidated temple every year. Only after the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party came did I become liberated, live in fourteen rooms, and have enough land to cultivate. Without the Communist Party, I would have died long ago. I will never forget the Communist Party."

　　Woman Yang Fuxiang said, "In the past, my husband was not upright and often gambled. Since he returned from the Eighth Route Army two years ago, he has become much better. He engages in production, and his temper is also better. My whole family is very harmonious. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could that be!"

　　When it was mentioned that July 1st was the Communist Party's birthday, the peasants became even more excited and unanimously said, "We really can't find the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, so on July 1st, we will all steam buns and have fun to celebrate the Communist Party's birthday." Yang Yan said, "We will not only do that, but the main thing is to improve mutual aid and production before July 1st, prepare for famine, everyone should do one good deed, make a contribution, and use the merit as a gift to the Communist Party." Everyone thought this was very right and proposed to make a contribution. After the meeting, some people were still discussing, "The Communist Party is really good. It doesn't want the people's things as gifts for its birthday, but also tells us to engage in production, mutual aid, and frugality to prevent drought and prepare for famine. It truly seeks the interests of the people everywhere."

　　Whether collective or individual, each village focused on summarizing and commending the advantages of the previous stage or selecting models. Based on current life and their work, they formulated a merit-making plan for July 1st. For example, Sun Feng, the manager of the cooperative, first led the cooperative cadres to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the first half of the year, immediately praising the advantages and pointing out the disadvantages, which further increased everyone's enthusiasm. Then, they discussed the cooperative's merit-making plan, and each cadre and each person in the work team formulated different merit-making plans.

　　After the launch of the merit-making and gift-giving campaign, it played a significant role in promoting current work, manifested in: (1) In production, many people used to sit idle on the streets, mainly in the afternoon. Now, these people have been given guidance on production methods and are organized through mutual aid teams. Liu Qiong used to be unproductive and very wasteful. After formulating a plan, he not only goes to the fields every day, but also stopped drinking alcohol. (2) In terms of frugality, meals have been widely changed, and many people are now eating bran porridge and fried noodles. Liu Chunbao's team launched a "handful of rice" campaign, with each person saving a handful of rice every day and not drinking alcohol. (3) When the cooperative recovered outstanding debts, Party members and cadres took the lead in paying off their debts, leading the masses to recover more than 160,000 yuan in seven days. In addition, they also carried out dryland farming, repairing water cellars, and creating fertilizer.

　　In short, during the development of this campaign, Party members recognized that July 1st was their Party's birthday and played a core leading role in the work of each village, truly becoming the locomotive of the central work.

　　涉县八区翻身农民饮水思源
    立功劳给七一献礼
    普遍订立计划加强生产备荒
    【本报涉县讯】八区六月初，普遍动员了迎接“七一”给党献礼大大开展立功运动以后，全区各村已轰轰烈烈的行动起来。各村以支部党员和翻身农民为骨干，回忆翻身利益，进一步提高群众的阶级觉悟，密切共产党与人民的关系，全村掀起七一前争取立一大功给党做寿运动。东安居在六月五号前后召开了党员、干部、贫雇积极分子（生产查减运动中的男女积极分子）群众会，广泛普遍的动员讨论，在这几次会上，经提出“翻身靠谁？谁叫咱过上好时光来？”以后，群众争着发言，王稀说：“我过去田无一垅，租种地主几亩地，一年打的粮食只够交租子，没有啥吃，把我的孙子也给了人家一个，没有半间破房，每年住着破庙。自八路军共产党来到后，我才翻了身，住上十四间房子，土地也够种了，没有共产党自己早死了，我永远忘不了共产党。”妇女杨富香说：“过去我的汉子不正行，常赌钱，自从前年八路军里退伍回来后可好了，又生产，脾气也好了，俺全家很和气。要没有共产党毛主席那能行呢！”当提出七一是共产党的生日后，农民们更加十分兴奋，一致的说：“咱实在找不见共产党毛主席，到七一那天都蒸馍娱乐好好的过过，给共产党做个生日。”杨炎说：“咱不光这样干，主要还是七一前搞好互助，生产备荒，每人做好一件事，立下功，拿功劳来给共产党献礼。”大家认为这很对，提出都要立一功。散会了还有人讨论说：“共产党真好，做生日不要老百姓东西做礼物，还叫咱搞生产，互助节约防旱备荒就顶送了礼物，真是处处为了老百姓谋利益。”各村无论集体的，个人的都有重点的把前一段的优点作了总结表扬或评选模范。又根据当前生活和自己的工作订出七一前的立功计划。如孙峰是合作社经理，首先领导合作社干部，把前半年的优点与缺点总结后立即表扬优点，同时指明缺点，这样更进一步提高了大家的积极性，然后讨论合作社立功计划，其余每个干部每个人都在拨工队订出不同的立功计划。立功献礼运动开展以后，对当前工作起了很大的推动作用，表现在：（一）生产上，以前每日坐街的人很多，主要是下午，现已给这些人指下生产门路，并以互助组有组织的进行。刘琼过去不生产，很浪费，经订计划后，不但每天到地好好受，而且酒也不喝了。（二）节约上普遍的换了饭，现吃糠锅炒面的很多。刘春保队开展了一把米运动，每人每天省米一把，不喝酒。（三）合作社收回外欠时党员干部先交清，带领群众七天收回十六万余元，其次还进行干种地，修水窑造肥等工作。总之，在开展这一运动中，党员们认识了七一是自己党的生日，在各村工作中都起了核心带头作用，真正成为中心工作的火车头。
