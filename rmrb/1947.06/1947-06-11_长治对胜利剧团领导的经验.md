Changzhi's Experience in Leading the Victory Troupe
    Shi Bingqian

    The Victory Troupe has a long history and has achieved considerable success. In the past, it had more contact with military propaganda teams and large troupes, and it worked hard to learn new things. However, it also picked up some of the bad habits of "large troupes." In addition, it was previously led by the Special Commissioner's Office, which meant it was closer to the upper levels. Therefore, when it went to the countryside, it inevitably showed a "large troupe" and "official troupe" air to some extent.

    Changzhi is a new district, and the masses' view of the troupe is still that of the old opera troupes of the past. They thought, "I paid for you to perform, so you have to perform what I tell you to," they had to get their money's worth. The troupe comrades, on the other hand, emphasized, "We are liberated now, and we are different from the old opera troupes of the past. We are not simply here to make you happy." So they simply told the masses, "Performing two acts is a regulation from above." Sometimes, after the performance, someone would come out and say, "Tonight's performance ends here, everyone go home." While announcing this, they would turn off the lights. They failed to take care of the emotions of the masses, adequately satisfy their demands, and did not explain things well, which naturally aroused dissatisfaction below. In addition, their attitude was also very rigid when maintaining order. As a result, some people reflected, "They are so fierce."

    This situation became most serious last summer. At that time, some local people called them the "Master Troupe."

    After the leadership discovered this problem, they tried to solve it. After the county's Hero Conference last winter, a joint meeting of responsible cadres from various districts and troupe cadres was held to conduct mutual self-criticism. On the one hand, the troupe was encouraged to engage in self-criticism. On the other hand, the cadres of each district were asked, "Do we regard the troupe as an old opera troupe, or as a propaganda force?" They were encouraged to more clearly understand the nature and role of the troupe and to better wield this weapon.

    Immediately afterward, "The White-Haired Girl" was performed at the Second Taihang Hero Conference. Cadres and the masses felt it was very good, and it had great significance for land reform education. As such, some performance locations were organized throughout the county in a planned way to more widely educate the county's farmers.

    After the Hero Conference, they performed eleven acts, which had a great effect, especially "The White-Haired Girl." When an old lady in Xinyi saw Xi'er being sold to the Huang family as a maid and being abused, she immediately demanded to go on stage to recount her own suffering, crying out about her childhood experience of being sold as a child bride and being abused. At this time, the audience shouted slogans continuously: If we don't defeat the feudal landlords, the peasants cannot be liberated! The landlords were so frightened that they ran home and dared not watch "The White-Haired Girl" again. There were many other vivid scenes in other places. In some places, after watching "The White-Haired Girl," they immediately went back to hold a struggle session.

    In addition, after the self-criticism, the troupe's attitude toward the masses also changed. When they arrived in a village, they would hold a joint meeting of cadres to discuss what plays to perform, and sometimes they would compose some temporary small programs such as drum songs based on local conditions. Although it was still a two-act performance, the program was increased, and the demands of the masses were appropriately satisfied, making it easier to gain the sympathy of the masses. Even Yincheng, which previously had the worst impression of the troupe, said, "The Victory Troupe has changed."

    Because their plays were closely linked to the current land reform movement, and their attitude had changed, the cadres' and the masses' perceptions of the troupe also changed greatly. When performing in various places, district and village cadres did a lot of organizational work. This time, in large villages, they were solely responsible (but organized nearby people to watch); in small villages, they were jointly responsible by the sub-district or several villages. When performing "The White-Haired Girl," all work in the villages stopped. Cadres organized all the people to watch, and jointly organized the theater and maintained order with the troupe, reflecting the great power of unity.

    In this month-long activity, they received six banners from the masses. Therefore, after the performance, the troupe members were in high spirits, saying that this time it was "fame and fortune." Indeed, after this performance, the Victory Troupe's prestige in Changzhi was greatly improved. This "fame and fortune" was the result of their close integration with the current land reform movement (the central task), and of accepting the opinions of the leadership and the masses, reforming their work style, and overcoming their past bad habits.

　　长治对胜利剧团领导的经验
    史秉谦
    胜利剧团历史较长，成绩也较大，过去与部队宣传队及大剧团接近多，对新东西的学习很努力。但同时也沾染了一些“大剧团”的恶习。加之过去又是归专署领导，接近上层多，因此下去的时候，就无形之中或多或少的表现出一种“大剧团”和“官剧团”的派头。
    长治是一个新区，群众对剧团的看法，还是过去那种旧戏班的观点。以为“我出了钱叫你唱戏，我叫你唱就得唱，”总得看过瘾。而剧团同志则强调“我们现在解放了，与过去的旧戏班不同，不是单纯图你高兴。”所以只是简单地向群众说：“两开演是上级的规定。”有时演完戏一个人走出来说上一句：“今天黑夜演到这里为止，大家回去吧。”一边宣布，一边就下汽灯。不能照顾群众的情绪，适当地满足群众的要求，又不很好地解释，当然引起下面的不满。另外，在维持秩序的时候，态度也很生硬，因此有些群众反映说：“好厉害。”
    这种情况发展到去年夏天最严重。当时有些地方的群众叫他们为：“老爷剧团。”
    领导上发现了这一问题以后，就设法解决。去冬县群英大会以后，召开了一个各区负责干部与剧团干部的联席会议，互相进行检讨。一方面启发剧团自我批评，一方面又向各区干部提出：“我们过去是把剧团当一个旧戏班看待，还是当成一个宣传力量来看待？”启发大家更加明确地认识剧团的性质与作用，更好地拿起这个武器。
    紧接着在太行二届群英大会上演出“白毛女”，干部与群众都感到很好，翻身教育意义很大。如是又有计划的在全县组织了一些演出地点，使之更普遍地教育全县农民。
    群英大会以后，他们演了十一个台口，效果很大，特别是“白毛女”。信义一个老太婆当看到喜儿卖到黄家当丫环，被毒打情形时，立即要求上台诉苦，把她幼年被卖当童养媳受虐待的情形哭诉了一遍。这时观众连续不断地喊口号：不打垮封建地主，农民就不能翻身！把地主们吓的跑到家里，再也不敢来看“白毛女”。其他地方也有许多生动场面，有的地方看完“白毛女”，马上就回去开斗争会。
    另外，经过检讨以后，剧团对群众的态度也转变了。到一个村子就开干部联席会议，商讨演什么戏，有时根据当地情况编些临时大鼓等小节目。虽然仍是两开演，但节目增加了，适当地满足了群众的要求，因此也容易取得群众的同情。连过去对剧团印象最不好的荫城，也说：“胜利剧团转变了。”
    因为他们的戏，紧紧地结合了当前的翻身运动，态度又有了转变，因此干部与群众对剧团的观感，也大为改变。在各地出演时，区村干部做了许多组织工作。这次出演，在大村是单独负担（但组织附近群众去看）；在小村则以小区或数村联合出演，共同负担。在演“白毛女”的时候，各村一切工作都停止。干部组织全部群众去看，并协同剧团共同组织剧场，维持秩序，体现了一元化的伟大力量。
    在这一个多月的活动中，他们收到了群众送给的六面旗子，所以演完以后，团员情绪都很高，说这次是“名利双全。”确实，经过这次演出以后，胜利剧团在长治的威信是大大地提高了。这种“名利双全”是由于他们紧紧与当前的翻身运动（中心工作）相结合，并接受了领导与群众的意见，改造了作风，克服了过去的恶习的结果。
