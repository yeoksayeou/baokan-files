　　Lingshi Border Area Haojia Village
    Cadres and Masses United to Kill the Enemy and Overthrow the Landlords
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 6th] Hao Minqi, chairman of the Haojia Village Farmers' Association in the Lingshi First District's forward position, proposed that cadres and masses should be of one mind, bravely kill the enemy and overthrow the landlords, and that leading cadres should take the lead in killing the enemy, take the lead in struggle, take the lead in enduring hardship, retreat last, and share the fruits last, in order to rapidly develop guerrilla warfare and land reform. On April 1st, six militiamen from the village repelled an attack by more than 300 enemies, wounding one enemy and destroying one enemy machine gun. The next day, more than 30 people from Guo Liangzi wanted to immediately settle accounts with the landlords. When distributing the fruits of victory, the masses gave cadres Hao Minqi and Hao Siqi one cave dwelling each, but they firmly refused. Later, feeling sorry, the masses sent them six feet of red and green cloth. Hao Minqi said, "We appreciate everyone's kindness, but Wang Yuhua is getting married now and has nothing. We are willing to give it to him." The masses were very moved.

　　灵石边地郝家庄
    干群一心杀敌翻身
    【本报太岳六日电】灵石一区前哨阵地郝家庄农会主席郝民祺为使游击战争与土地改革迅速开展，曾提出干部与群众一条心，勇敢杀敌又翻身，领导干部做到杀敌在先，斗争在先，吃苦在先，退却在后，分果实在后。四月一日该村六个民兵打退了三百余敌人的进攻，伤敌一人，毁敌机枪一挺。第二天即有郭亮子三十余人要立即向地主算账。分配果实时，群众分给干部郝民祺、郝四祺窑洞各一孔，但他们坚不要，后来群众过意不去，又送给他们六尺红绿布，郝民祺说：“我们在此领大家的情，现在王玉花要结婚，什么也没有，我们愿意转送给他。”群众都非常感动。
