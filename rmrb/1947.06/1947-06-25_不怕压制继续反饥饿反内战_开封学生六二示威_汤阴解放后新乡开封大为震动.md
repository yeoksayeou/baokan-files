From our correspondent in the Jilu Yu Region, 23rd: According to a large number of students and merchants who recently fled from Kaifeng and Xinxiang to the liberated areas, the liberation of Tangyin has greatly shaken the important Kuomintang military strongholds of Xinxiang, Ji County, and Kaifeng in northern Henan. Officials, both high and low, are in a state of panic. Families of Kuomintang officials in Xinxiang are moving their assets south. Important agencies in Kaifeng are also relocating to areas around Shuhe and Xuchang. Military police are heavily deployed within Kaifeng city, and along the railway line, stations, and near the city gates, forced labor is being carried out on a large scale to rush the construction of defensive fortifications. Trees within a radius of dozens of miles have been completely felled, and the residents of the city are eager for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army to relieve their hunger and suffering. In the Kuomintang Commissioner's Office in Xinxiang, the *Taihang New China Daily* is circulating semi-openly and semi-secretly. Under the leadership of students from Henan University, the anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement among students in Kaifeng is intensifying. On the "June 2nd" anti-civil war day, students, led by those from Henan University, held a parade and demonstration, painting cartoons and slogans along the streets denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous collusion with American imperialism. During the march, military police in various streets attempted to suppress them, but the students bravely marched forward without fear. One day, military police surrounded Henan University, and under the guard of several machine guns, students were subjected to full-body searches, and more than a dozen so-called "suspects" were arrested. Journalists from Kaifeng and other places jointly issued a declaration, condemning Chiang Kai-shek for launching a civil war and causing hunger among the people. Several Kuomintang newspapers also openly criticized the Chiang Kai-shek government. One newspaper published an article entitled "The Kuomintang Politics in My Eyes," criticizing the dark rule of the Chiang family.

    开封学生六二示威
    汤阴解放后新乡开封大为震动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】据近由开封、新乡逃来解放区之大批学生、商人谈：汤阴解放后，豫北蒋军重要屯兵点新乡、汲县、开封等城镇大为震动，大小官员均陷入恐慌状态中。新乡蒋军官员眷属，均将资财南移。开封重要机关也正向沭河、许昌一带迁移。开封城内军警森严，铁道沿线、车站、城关附近正大肆抓夫，赶修防御工事。方圆数十里的树木已被砍伐尽净，城内居民均渴望解放军到来解除其饥饿痛苦。新乡的蒋记专员公署中，半公开半秘密的流传着太行版新华日报。开封学生在河南大学学生领导下，反内战反饥饿运动日趋激烈。“六·二”反内战日，以河南大学学生为前导举行游行示威，沿街涂画蒋贼勾搭美帝国主义卖国的漫画标语，游行时各街军警企图镇压，但学生奋勇直前毫不畏缩。某日军警将河大包围，在数挺机枪把守下，学生遭受全身搜查，并捕去所谓“嫌疑分子”十余名。开封等地新闻记者联名发表宣言，控诉蒋介石发动内战，造成人民饥饿。若干国民党报纸亦公开指斥蒋政府。某报上曾发表“我眼中的国民党政治”一文，斥责蒋家的黑暗统治。
