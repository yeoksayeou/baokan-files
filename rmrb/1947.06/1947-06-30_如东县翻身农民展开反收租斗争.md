Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th -- After the new wheat harvest, liberated peasants in the Jianghou Rudong County in Central Jiangsu Province have launched a full-scale struggle against rent collection. The government, in accordance with the demands of the masses, has posted notices everywhere prohibiting rent collection and "plowing back the fields," supporting the masses. It also publicly tried and executed Chen Zeguang, the head of the land recovery team, and educated and released eight accomplices. Armed work teams penetrated the KMT-occupied areas to hold "window sill meetings," spreading victory news and government decrees from house to house. Village cadres and peasants swore: "Whoever collects rent or plows back fields, we will fight them to the death; whoever secretly pays rent, we will hold them responsible for the entire rent grain." They also copied government notices and posted them directly near strongholds and at the doors of "home returning legions." Generally, landlords guaranteed at village meetings that they would not illegally collect rent. Many KMT Bao and Jia heads close to strongholds expressed their willingness to perform secret deeds to redeem themselves, guaranteeing that no one in their Bao or Jia would collect rent or plow back fields. In a village half a li away from a bunker, some peasants who had received land were unable to harvest wheat, so the landlords harvested and delivered it for them, making the few "home returning legion" bullies extremely isolated.

　　如东县翻身农民展开反收租斗争
    【新华社华中二十八日电】苏中蒋后如（皋）东县翻身农民于新麦登场后，全面展开反收租斗争。政府顺应群众要求遍贴禁止收租“扒田”布告，为群众撑腰。并公审枪毙复田队长陈择广，教育释放八个从犯。武工队插入蒋占区开“窗槛会”，挨家宣传胜利消息和政府法令。各村干和农民宣誓：“那个收租扒田，齐心同他拚命；那个私下交租，全体租粮要他负责。”并抄录政府布告直贴到据点附近和“还乡团”门口。一般地主在村民会上保证不违法收租。不少紧靠据点之蒋记保甲长表示愿立暗功赎罪，保证本保本甲无人收租扒田。距碉堡半里之某村，有些得田农民不能收麦，地主便代为收割送来，使少数“还乡团”恶霸已极孤立。
