　　Tangyin Breaks Through at One Point, Shocking the Whole City
    Three Days to Overthrow Nine Landlords
    [This newspaper's Tangyin dispatch] The victorious overthrow of the great despotic landlord Su Boyin in Tangyin's urban area set an example for the masses of the whole city, boosting their fighting spirit, and everywhere there was a brewing of "Let's do it the same way!" Following this, each street convened meetings of activists and grassroots masses to discuss whether the struggle against Su Boyin was right or wrong, and whether it should be carried out. The masses recognized that the struggle was reasonable and legal, and then they began to brew up momentum, putting forward targets for struggle in their own streets. Under the slogans of struggling against the despotic landlords, settling accounts for grain and money, and pouring out grievances to vent their anger, the whole city universally rose up in struggle, overthrowing nine large landlord households in three days. More than two thousand people in the whole city participated in the struggle, implementing joint struggles between the urban area and the city, or separate street struggles, depending on the size of the landlord. This struggle in Tangyin raised the consciousness of the masses in action and organized them. In the beginning, the masses thought that struggle was unconscionable, that poverty was fate, and the idea of ​​changing the world was very serious. The leadership first organized the struggle, letting the masses take action. In the struggle, the masses realized that the struggle was reasonable, not unconscionable, not fate, and they had the desire to organize. At this time, the call to organize a poor peasant association was put forward, and the masses, with coolies, workers, and vendors as the backbone, quickly organized their poor brothers. In addition, carrying out the meritorious service campaign to boost the fighting spirit was also an important part of the rapid development of the struggle. After each struggle, merits were evaluated among the active elements of the masses. First, each person reported their merits (self-criticism), then merits were evaluated (mutual criticism), and finally merits were compared and recorded. The standards were being active and responsible in the struggle, speaking reasonably while pouring out grievances, leading the masses to pour out grievances and speak reasonably, and not taking too much or privately taking a little bit of the fruits of the struggle. In this way, the good activists who had rendered meritorious service were very energetic, and also improved the enthusiasm of other activists, with everyone striving to render meritorious service for the people. When distributing the fruits, a quick distribution policy was adopted. A preliminary survey of coolies, shop assistants, and vendors was conducted by street, divided into three levels. Active elements were treated the same as the masses. In the distribution, the masses were educated on where the fruits came from, and their combat effectiveness was improved. Once the fruits were distributed, everyone's fighting spirit also improved significantly. (Li Gan)

　　汤阴突破一点轰动全城
    三天斗倒九大地主
    【本报汤阴讯】汤阴城关胜利斗倒大恶霸地主苏伯寅，给全城群众做了示范，鼓舞了群众斗争情绪，到处酝酿着“照样干吧！”接着，各街召开了积极分子与基层群众会议，讨论斗争苏伯寅对不对？该斗争不该斗争？群众认识了斗争是合理合法的，便酝酿起来，纷纷提出了本街斗争对象，在斗倒恶霸地主算粮算款诉苦出气的口号下，全城普遍斗争起来，三天斗倒了九户大地主。全城参加斗争的人在二千以上，按地主大小实行城关与城内联合斗争或分街斗争。汤阴这次斗争是在行动中提高了群众觉悟，并组织起来。开始，群众认为斗争亏心，穷是命，变天思想很严重，而领导上首先组织斗争，让群众行动起来，群众在斗争中知道斗争是合理的，不亏心，不是命，有了组织起来的要求，这时提出了组织贫民会号召，群众便以苦力、工人、小贩为骨干去串连穷兄弟，很快组织起来。另外，开展立功运动，提高斗争情绪，也是斗争迅速开展的重要一环。每次斗争后，都在群众积极分子中进行评功，首先每个人表功（自我检讨），然后评功（互相检讨），最后比功记功。标准是斗争中积极负责，自己诉苦讲理，并带领群众诉苦讲理，不多分与私拿一点斗争果实。这样，好的积极分子立了功很起劲，也提高了其他积极分子的积极性，人人争取为民立功。分配果实时，采取快分方针，按街把苦力店员、小贩作了初步调查，分为三等；积极分子和群众一样，在分配中教育群众，果实从那里来的，提高战斗力，果实一分，大家斗争情绪也有显著提高。（李干）
