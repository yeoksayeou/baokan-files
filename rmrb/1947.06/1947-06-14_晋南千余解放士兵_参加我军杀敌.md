　　More Than a Thousand Liberated Soldiers in Southern Shanxi
  　Join Our Army to Kill the Enemy
    [Reported from Taiyue by our newspaper on the 13th] More than 1,200 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers liberated in the Southern Shanxi Campaign have voluntarily requested to join the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly defeat Chiang Kai-shek. Li Shulin, a new recruit of the 8th Company of the 30th Division's New Soldiers Regiment, took off his clothes to show the reporter his scars, saying, "These were from being beaten by the platoon leader and squad leader in the Kuomintang army. My thighs were stabbed twice with bayonets, and I wasn't given treatment. I had to march with injuries and was also punished by carrying a mountain howitzer shell, ten pairs of shoes, and eight days of rations, while I could only drink two teacups of thin noodle soup each day. The wounds bled, and my whole body ached. When I couldn't keep up with the team, the squad leader and platoon leader whipped me from behind with sticks. After joining the Eighth Route Army, I received medicine for the first time. This hatred cannot go unavenged. I request to join the People's Liberation Army and turn our Gansu Province into a liberated area." Other soldiers also expressed similar desires. The People's Liberation Army accepted their requests and held a welcome ceremony for their enlistment in a certain place on the 31st. They all shouted with anger, "Fight back to our hometown and avenge our parents!" Chang Yanwen said, "I am now experiencing a small turnaround, but my parents are still being oppressed at home. I want to experience a big turnaround in the future and defeat Chiang Kai-shek." Chen Qunwu, from the 7th Company of the 30th Division's New Soldiers Regiment, announced his determination, saying, "First, I will fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. I was his cannon fodder for ten years, and now I am awake. Second, I will abide by discipline and not take anything from the people. Treat prisoners with leniency and generosity, and don't take their belongings. But if they want to be loyal dogs to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, then resolutely eliminate them." Note: This is the third group of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan soldiers liberated in the Southern Shanxi Campaign who have requested to join the People's Liberation Army, totaling 3,300 people.
    [Reported from Taiyue by our newspaper on the 13th] Twelve military doctors, including Wang Yonglin and Liu Hanchen, who were liberated from the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan armies, have realized after half a year of study that "the only way to achieve peace is to defeat Chiang Kai-shek." They have unanimously requested to join the People's Liberation Army to serve the people and perform meritorious service. The regimental headquarters of the PLA Officers' Training Regiment approved their requests and held a forum on a certain day to bid them farewell as they joined the army.

　　晋南千余解放士兵
  　参加我军杀敌
    【本报太岳十三日电】晋南战役被解放之蒋军士兵，又有一千二百余人自动要求参加人民解放军，彻底打败蒋介石。三十师新兵团第八连新兵李树林脱了衣服给记者看那满身伤痕，他说：“这是我在国民党军被排长班长吊打伤的，大腿上还被刺过两刺刀，不给医治，带伤行军，还罚背一颗山炮弹，十双鞋，八天给养，而自己每天只能喝两茶缸稀汤面。疮口流血，满身痛疼，跟不上队伍，班长和排长在后面用棍子赶我。到八路军以后，第一次上药。这个仇不能不报，我要求参加人民解放军，把咱甘省也要变成解放区。其他战士，也均表示类似之愿望。人民解放军接受他们的要求，于三十一日在某地召开欢迎入伍大会。他们全体激愤高呼：“打回老家去，为父母报仇。”常燕文说：“我现时小翻身，父母还在家受压迫，我将来要大翻身，打败蒋介石”。三十师新兵团七连陈群武宣布他的决心说“第一，我要和蒋介石拚到底，我给他当了十年炮灰，现在醒了。第二要遵守纪律，不拿老百姓东西。对俘虏宽大优待，不拿他的东西。但如果他要给卖国贼蒋介石当死狗，就坚决消灭他。”按：晋南战役解放之蒋阎军士兵，此是第三批请求参加人民解放军，共计三千三百人。
    【本报太岳十三日电】被解放的蒋阎军王永林、刘汉臣等十二位军医，经过半年的学习，都认识到“要和平只有打败蒋介石”，一致要求参加人民解放军为民立功，解放军官教导团团部批准了他们的要求，并于某日召开座谈会欢送他们入伍。
