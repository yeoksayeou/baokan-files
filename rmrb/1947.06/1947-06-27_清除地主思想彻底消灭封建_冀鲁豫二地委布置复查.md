Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th (This Newspaper's Dispatch)—The Second Prefectural Committee of Ji-Lu-Yu convened an activists' conference to arrange a review. The cadres present fully studied the series of destructive activities of the landlord class during the land reform, analyzed the nature of the landlords, and further clarified their class consciousness. Many cadres reflected on their sympathy for the landlords during the land reform, seeing only the superficially pitiful side of the landlords' pretense, and not seeing their side of oppressing and exploiting the masses. Some suggested that landlords who had "progressed" should be given a way out. This concern for the interests of the landlords without concern for whether the peasants' emancipation was thorough demonstrated their unstable class stance. Everyone also clearly recognized that the landlord class was taking advantage of the respite after our participation in the army to actively counterattack the peasants. The cadres present unanimously stated: "We may rest, but they don't. We must have the spirit of beating a dog in the water, thoroughly eliminate the landlord class, and continue until the peasants are completely emancipated." At this point, the conference turned to a specific discussion of how to deeply mobilize the masses, and finally Comrade Wang Junyu of the Prefectural Committee made a concluding speech. He pointed out: (1) Regarding the elimination of the landlord class and the landlord ideology among cadres, he said: Today's land reform is not a problem of a certain person, a certain district, or a certain village, but a major issue of eliminating the landlord class and determining the Chinese revolution. A few cadres, seeing that the struggle involved landlords related to themselves, would say, "Land reform is good, but why does it affect me!" Such people have not realized that eliminating the landlord class is not about eliminating some and leaving others, but resolutely eliminating wherever landlords exist. We should clearly recognize that the landlord class has been greatly hit, but it is far from being eliminated. The landlord class is stubbornly resisting, using a defensive and concealed form, attempting to preserve their last strength, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. The strategy of the landlord class is superficially defensive, but it is also resisting with very active actions. Because the class distinctions in today's countryside have not been clearly drawn, if we think that the landlord class has no power, that the landlords have "lowered their heads," such a contemptuous view is very wrong. The "almost" mentality will kill people. (2) The basic problem of thoroughly reviewing and fully and universally mobilizing the masses is to clearly distinguish the boundaries between the peasants and the landlord class, and to strengthen ideological leadership over the peasants. To mobilize 90% of the masses, the main thing is to satisfy the masses' demands, eliminate the masses' concerns, boldly let go, follow the mass line, and universally mobilize the backward masses. The "control of landlords" should be strictly distinguished from the "control of the backward" in work. There are three types of people among the masses: "advanced, middle, and backward," but there is no essential difference, but rather a difference in the degree of awareness, with some being earlier and some being later. It is very inappropriate to use organizational means to control backward masses, giving them a "running dog photo," which will create an attitude of hatred towards backward elements among activists. The result of hating backward masses is that the advanced fight alone, cannot defeat the landlords, and are easily exploited by the landlords. (3) In order to continue to eliminate the landlords, the relationship between new and old village cadres must be united, and they must not be provoked and used by the landlords. At the same time, attention should be paid to facing the broad masses, boldly discovering and promoting good activists and cadres. The report concluded: To mobilize all the peasants, we must also pay attention to implementing the policy of uniting the middle peasants and mobilizing the broad masses of women.

　　清除地主思想彻底消灭封建
    冀鲁豫二地委布置复查
    【本报冀鲁豫廿五日电】二地委召开活动分子大会布置复查。到会干部充分研究了土地改革中地主阶级一连串的破坏活动，分析地主的本质，进一步明确了阶级观念。不少干部反省了自己在土改中对地主的怜悯思想，只看到地主表面上伪装可怜的一面，而没看到其压迫削剥群众的一面。有的提出地主“进步”，得给人家留个路。这种关心地主利益而不关心农民翻身是否彻底，都表现了自己阶级立场不稳。大家又清楚的认识到地主阶级乘着我们参军后松一口气的空子，积极向农民反攻。到会干部一致表示：“咱歇人家可不歇，要有打落水狗精神，把地主阶级彻底消灭，一直到农民彻底翻身。”至此大会转入如何深入发动群众的具体问题讨论，最后由地委王均予同志总结发言。指出：（一）关于消灭地主阶级，并消灭干部中的地主思想问题，他说：今天的土地改革不是某人某区某村的问题，是消灭地主阶级，决定中国革命的大问题。少数干部看见斗到与自己有关的地主身上，便说：“土改好是好，怎么改到我的头上来了！”这种人没有了解到消灭地主阶级，不是消灭这一部分留那一部分，而是那里有地主存在就坚决消灭。我们应清楚认识目前地主阶级已受到很大打击，但离被消灭还很远。地主阶级正在顽强抵抗，用一种防御隐蔽的形式，企图保存最后的力量，待机反攻。地主阶级的战略表面是防御的，但却又以非常积极的行动来反抗。因为今天的农村还没有把阶级划清楚，我们如果认为地主阶级已没有力量，地主“低头啦”，这种轻视观念是非常错误的。“差不多”思想会害死人。（二）深入复查充分普遍发动群众的基本问题是划清农民与地主阶级的界限，加强对农民的思想领导。要发动百分之九十的群众，主要的是满足群众要求，扫除群众的顾虑，大胆放手，走群众路线，把落后群众普遍发动起来，“控制地主”要与工作中的“控制落后”有严格区别，群众中有三部分人“先进、中间、落后”，但不是本质的区别，而是觉悟的程度的有先有后，用组织手段来控制落后群众，给他们挂一个“狗腿照”，是很不妥当的，会造成积极分子对落后分子的仇视态度，仇视落后群众的结果，先进的孤军作战，打不垮地主，并易为地主所利用。（三）为了继续消灭地主，新老村干部的关系要团结好，不要被地主挑拨利用。同时注意面向广大群众，大胆的发现和提拔好的积极分子和干部。报告最后称：要发动全体农民，还必须注意贯彻联合中农的政策，并要把广大妇女发动起来。
