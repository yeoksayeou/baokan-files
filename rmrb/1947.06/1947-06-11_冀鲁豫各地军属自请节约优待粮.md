[Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 9th] Military families in various parts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan are voluntarily saving spring preferential military grain to support the front lines. In Qinjiacun, Qingfeng First District, at a military family meeting, 70-year-old Qin Yunjing said, "I sell sesame cakes and peanuts to eat and wear, I don't need preferential grain. Letting my children join the army is not for eating preferential grain, but to defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, otherwise, our liberation will not be secure." Then other military families also scrambled to volunteer not to receive preferential military grain. Ma Yulong, a military family in Guancheng First District, proposed at a merit conference of over a thousand people in the district: After the wheat harvest, one斗(dǒu) of corn and one斗(dǒu) of millet is enough to eat. To defeat old Chiang, I also decline to receive spring preferential grain." Ma Yujin, a model soldier from Houshangu, said, "Everyone says that after my husband joined the army, I can't do the work at home like fetching water, feeding cattle, and padding the pen, but I can exchange work with others. Now I can lead eight preferential military teams to take care of other military families." All thousand plus military families in the district were very moved and unanimously decided not to accept spring preferential treatment. Seven military families in Dongmagou with labor take care of those without, and automatically organize manpower and animal power for labor exchange and mutual assistance. Military families in the Second District proposed: Save food to supply the front, earn more bullets, and win more battles. All seventy military families in the district unanimously did not receive preferential grain, and ensured that they did not need preferential treatment from the village's labor force. The head of the military family farmers' association in Kangzhuang, Third District, said, "To eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, I not only don't want preferential grain, but I also send the ten斤(jīn) of rice I bought with salt to other military families." Military dependents of martyrs in Shou's First District launched a campaign to perform meritorious service for the masses, and did not want a single grain of spring preferential treatment. The military families in Dongzhifang and Chenyao were very poor, but this spring, they not only did not receive preferential grain but also voluntarily donated grain to the front. Wei Dianfa, a military family member in Zhanghutong, Third District, is 64 years old, and he also organized the village's elderly class, children's corps, sisters' group, and young women, led by the elderly class, to weed for the military families and family members who went out to build dikes. In one and a half days, they weeded fifteen acres of sorghum seedlings.

[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, 9th] Wang Fengchen and Zhang Zhitang, honored soldiers of Xindian Town, Ren County, researched production methods suitable for their physical strength. Every day, they scrape soil from the alkali land west of the village to extract saltpeter. In half a month, they have extracted 9,000斤(jīn) of saltpeter, worth 60,000 洋(Yáng) [silver dollars], which has solved the food and clothing problem for their six family members. Zhitang said, "This way, we don't need government relief and reduce the burden on the masses."

[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, 9th] Each village in the Seventh District of Wei County practices strict economy. The masses in the entire district notified each other: "Our villages will not provide cigarettes and alcohol for red and white events." Each village swore not to buy foreign colors. It is estimated that each person can save 3,000 元(yuán) per season. Taking the 300 plus people in Shengfotang as an example, they can save more than 900,000 元(yuán) in one season. The entire village of Shengfotang has switched to red sorghum buns, and half of the families eat mixed wild vegetables. Nancaichang stipulates that each person saves two liang of grain per day. If it doesn't rain again, each group will dig a soil well. Not eating cakes or meat when going to markets or meetings has been universally implemented.
