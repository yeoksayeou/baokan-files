Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 9th: The troops under General Lin Biao annihilated the Kuomintang army's 60th Army Provisional 21st Division in the Shuangyang Jichangzhen (southeast of Shuangyang) area, achieving a victory of killing, wounding, and capturing over 8,000 enemies. The Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters has issued the fifth communiqué of the summer offensive, announcing the details of this battle, stating: When a part of our army attacked Hailong Chaoyangzhen on May 30th, the Kuomintang army's Provisional 21st Division, which was guarding the city, realizing it was deeply isolated and without reinforcements, abandoned the city and fled in panic that night. The division first scurried to Chaoyang Mountain southeast of Yitong, attempting to escape to Changchun, but was blocked by our army. Failing to flee west, it turned north, attempting to seek refuge in Jilin. Our army tracked and pursued them, relentlessly chasing them through the mountains and dense forests for three days and nights. The enemy was like a fish in a cauldron, unable to escape. At this time, the 60th Army's 182nd Division of the Jilin garrison sent a battalion south in an attempt to reinforce them. On the 2nd of this month, when they arrived at Shuanghezhen, they were completely annihilated by our army. At this point, the enemy was in a desperate situation. Our armies then completely encircled and annihilated them in the Wujiazi to Jichangzhen area southeast of Shuangyang on the 2nd and 3rd of this month. The division commander, Long Yao, was wounded and his whereabouts are unknown, while the deputy division commander, Ren Xiaozong, suffered a pointless sacrifice. The Provisional 21st Division, driven by the Chiang bandits from Yunnan, thousands of miles away, to the front lines of the civil war in the Northeast, ended up being completely wiped out. According to preliminary statistics, the results of this battle were: over 2,300 enemies killed and wounded, including Deputy Division Commander Ren Xiaozong and below, and 6,053 officers and soldiers captured alive, including Division Staff Director Yang Zhaorang, Deputy Regiment Commander He Ershou, and Liu Guangze. The captured items include 3,518 rifles and carbines, 159 light and heavy machine guns, 98 submachine guns, 2 anti-aircraft machine guns, 5 anti-tank guns, 8 signal guns, 9 mortars, 16 60mm mortars, 6 rocket launchers, 9 mountain guns, 32 grenade launchers, over 200,000 rounds of ammunition, 60 war horses, 63 telephones, 5 radio stations, and many other military supplies.
