Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 8th: A "Respect Heroes, Learn from Models" movement is being carried out in a certain regiment of the East China People's Liberation Army. According to the political director of the regiment: The development of the movement to respect heroes and learn from models will further consolidate the mass foundation of revolutionary heroism and encourage everyone to pursue the advanced example of heroes. In political work, this is a powerful ideological mobilization in continuous combat. In military terms, it will emphasize learning from Guo Jisheng, who has been awarded the title of "East China Combat Hero," combining his resourceful and clever command art with his resolute and courageous combat style, so that the military skills of commanders and fighters will be universally improved. Guo Jisheng has now been invited to report his command experience to fraternal companies. The following is a brief introduction to Guo Jisheng's resourceful and courageous deeds:

　　During the first self-defense war, he was still a soldier. In the battle of Mengjiacang in Lincheng, when he climbed into the enemy's wall, the follow-up troops were blocked by enemy fire and could not catch up. At this time, the enemy company commander in the blockhouse sent a messenger to contact his platoon leader. The messenger walked and shouted, "Platoon Leader ×, Platoon Leader ×!..." Gradually approaching Guo Jisheng. In the darkness, Guo alertly replied, "Here, come here." He immediately pounced and grabbed him. As a result, the enemy on the blockhouse was successfully eliminated. During the Teng County battle, after Guo Jisheng led a assault squad to break into the North Gate, he charged into the enemy's formation alone, mingling with hundreds of enemies. Guo Jisheng cleverly impersonated the enemy, shouting, "It's terrible, the Eighth Route Army has entered the city, let's surrender!" This shook the enemy's morale, forcing the well-equipped Special Service Battalion of the First Provisional Brigade of the KMT army to lay down their arms. In the battle of Fengshan north of Suqian, the regimental commander ordered Guo Jisheng's company to take the most important stronghold. Guo Jisheng led the assault team to outflank the rear of the stronghold. The secret machine gun firepower network pre-arranged by the KMT army failed to deploy in time, and the fortifications were breached. Guo Jisheng's company annihilated a KMT force larger than its own with minimal casualties, opening the way for the mountain-attacking troops. During the Lu'nan Campaign, Guo Jisheng fiercely pursued the First Rapid Column of the KMT army on the Lanling battlefield. He rushed to the vicinity of a KMT tank, killed the driver, and captured a complete tank. Guo Jisheng is also skilled in conducting political offensives, and his throat is always hoarse after each battle. During the street fighting in Yixian County, he led his troops to surround a KMT company and conducted a twenty-minute shouting session. The soldiers were impatient, but he patiently continued to shout, and finally the KMT sent a representative to negotiate, thus disarming a KMT company without bloodshed. In the Tai'an Campaign, Guo Jisheng led two assault squads and, with flexible and clever command, created a glorious example of continuously breaking through several lines of strong enemy defenses, conducting fierce street fighting for a day and night, and repelling more than twenty enemy counterattacks, while suffering only minor injuries himself. Guo Jisheng is currently the company commander of the First Company of a certain regiment of the East China People's Liberation Army. After the Tai'an Campaign, he received a commendation from the unit, and the headquarters of the East China People's Liberation Army promoted him to "East China Combat Hero." The soldiers in his company all say, "Our Company Commander Guo is really good at commanding. Fighting with our Company Commander Guo means winning battles and not suffering losses."

　　“华东战斗英雄”
    郭继胜智勇双全屡战屡胜
    【新华社华东前线八日电】华东人民解放军某团正开展尊重英雄学习模范运动。据该团政治主任说：尊英学模运动的开展，将更加巩固革命英雄主义的群众基础，鼓励大家追求英模的上进的热潮，在政治工作上这是在连续战斗中有力的思想动员，在军事上将强调学习荣获“华东战斗英雄”称号的郭继胜智勇双全，灵活巧妙之指挥艺术，与坚决果敢的战斗作风相结合，使指战员军事技术普遍提高一步。现郭继胜正被邀到兄弟连队报告他的指挥经验。下面便是郭继胜智勇双全的事迹的简要介绍：
    在第一次自卫战争中，他还是战士。临城孟家仓战斗中，他爬进敌人围墙时，后续部队被敌人火力封锁着赶不上来。这时，炮楼内敌连长派下传令兵和其排长连络，传令兵边走边喊：“×排长，×排长！……”渐渐走向郭继胜。在黑暗中，郭机警的答应着：“在这里，你过来吧。”随即扑上去，一把抓住。因此，顺利解决了炮楼上的敌人。滕县战斗时，郭继胜带突击班突进北门后，单身冲入敌阵，和数百敌人混做一团。郭继胜巧妙地冒充敌人，大叫：“不得了，八路进城，咱快缴枪吧！”动摇了敌人的斗志，迫使优良装备的蒋军暂一旅特务营放下武器。宿（迁）北烽山战斗中，团指挥员命令郭继胜连拿下最重要的一个据点。郭继胜率突击队迂回到据点侧后，蒋军预设的秘密机枪火力网未及展开，工事已被突破；郭继胜连以极轻微的伤亡，全歼数量超过自己的蒋军，为攻山部队开辟了道路。鲁南战役中，郭继胜在兰陵战场上猛追蒋军第一快速纵队，他冲到蒋军坦克近旁，将驾驶员击毙，缴获完整坦克一辆。郭继胜又是进行政治攻势的能手，每次战斗下来，他的喉咙总是喑哑的。峄县城巷战时，他率部包围蒋军一个连，进行了二十分钟的喊话，战士们等的不耐烦了，但他仍然耐心的继续喊话，终于蒋军派代表出来谈判，这样兵不血刃的解除了蒋军一个连的武装。泰安战役中，郭继胜率两个突击班以灵活巧妙的指挥，创造了连续突破敌数道坚固防线，进行一昼夜激烈巷战，打垮敌二十余次反冲锋、而自己仅轻伤一人的光辉战例。郭继胜现为华东人民解放军某团第一连连长。泰安战役后，得到该部队通报表扬，华东人民解放军总部并晋升他为“华东战斗英雄”。他连里的战士都说：“俺郭连长指挥真有办法，跟俺郭连长打仗，光打胜仗，不吃亏。”
