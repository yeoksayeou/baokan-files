　　[This dispatch from our Taiyue office on the 4th] In Jincheng this spring plowing season, many model military and martyrs' families have emerged, playing a leading role in production and participation in the war effort. Seeing the labor shortage this year, they labored themselves, declining assistance in plowing. Guo Huaizhu, a military family member in Wangchengtou, Sixth District, not only didn't need anyone to help plow, but also helped Ji Gui's family (a military family member) plant four mu of land. Cui Guocheng's mother in Lijiaping, Fifth District, herself declined assistance in plowing and mobilized three other military families to help each other in production. Jiao Tielu, a military family member in Xizhuang Village, Ninth District, personally led a mutual aid group and was recognized as a model. Guo Xianghai, a military family member in Mayu Village, Ninth District, insisted on being assigned labor duties despite the cadres' reluctance. Zhang Chaosheng, a military family member in Dongcun, Fifth District, made two pairs of military shoes during this year's spring plowing. Zhang Shuifa, a military family member in Sanjiadian, Ninth District, divided the labor among his family for planting, twisting cotton, spinning, weaving, and raising chickens, determined to "cultivate three and make one."

　　[This dispatch from our Nanyuan office] In the upsurge of the "Great Production, All-Out Support for the Front, and Making Contributions for the People" movement in the Third and Fifth Districts, more than twenty honorably discharged veterans have voluntarily declined assistance in plowing, determined to make new contributions for the people on the production front. Comrade Tu Yushu from Xiadian, Third District, was gloriously wounded during the Shangdang Campaign. Since settling in Xiadian in 1945, he has had a good relationship with the masses and has been supported by them. To maintain the fine qualities of a revolutionary soldier, he has worked very hard to establish his household. In this year's Great Production movement, he is determined to make new contributions for the people, voluntarily declining assistance in plowing during the spring plowing season. In Guxian, Fifth District, fifteen honorably discharged veterans, in order to save civilian labor to support the front, discussed the issue of assistance in plowing at the people's school. When the masses were unable to resolve the issue, they all unanimously proposed that they would no longer need the masses to help plow, and would completely cultivate the land themselves, and proposed that they would also help the masses plant land when they had time. Under their influence, the honorably discharged veterans in each district proposed that they would not need the masses to help plow, and would make new contributions for the people on the production front. According to incomplete statistics, more than twenty honorably discharged veterans in the Third, Fifth, and Chengguan districts can save more than 2,400 labor days for the masses on their 160 mu of land.

　　[This dispatch from our Wu'an office] In Chengguan District, honorably discharged veterans have played a model role in cotton planting. Niu Suintang, an honored serviceman from Fourth Street, carried 31 loads of water a day and planted more than three fen of cotton. Wang You drove his own mule, loaded his own fertilizer, and burned his own fuel, helping the masses haul eight carts of water in half a day. Huang Mingqi from Fifth Street not only labored himself but also mobilized his wife to go to the fields and carry more than ten loads of water. In addition, Wang Tingrong, Feng Zicai, and others have played a model role. They not only worked themselves but also led a group to work vigorously. The masses all reflected, "They shed blood on the front, and they still work so hard in the rear. How can we not work harder?" Discharged veteran Xu Guoying used to just wait for preferential treatment. This time, he was particularly active, carrying more than 40 loads of water a day. The masses all said, "Lao Xu is really not simple. In the future, if he has any difficulties, we must sincerely help him. We can't just dislike him anymore." Now, due to the model role of honorably discharged veterans, the movement to carry water and plant seedlings is even more enthusiastic throughout Chengguan District. (Shubi)

　　各地荣军组织互助
    生产战线再立大功
    【本报太岳四日电】晋城今年春耕中出现了许多模范军、烈属，在生产参战中起带头作用。他们看到今年劳力缺乏，便自己劳动，谢绝代耕。六区望城头军属郭怀珠不但不用人代耕，还帮积贵家（军属）种地四亩。五区李家坪崔国城母亲自己谢绝代耕，并动员另外三家军属互助生产。九区西庄村军属焦铁炉亲自领导一个互助组，被公认为模范。九区麻峪村军属郭香孩，干部不让他支差，他坚决要支。五区东村军属张朝相今年春耕中自动做了二双军鞋。九区三家店军属张水法，全家分工劳动种地、搓花、纺织、养鸡，决心要做到耕三做一。
    【本报囊垣讯】三、五区在开展大生产全力支援前线为民立功运动的浪潮中，有二十多名荣退军人，自动谢绝群众代耕，要在生产战线再为人民立功。三区夏店涂玉书同志是上党战役光荣负伤下来的，自四五年安家到夏店后，与群众关系很好，得到群众拥护，为保持革命军人优良品质，很勤劳的建立家务。在今年大生产运动中，决心要为人民再立功劳，春耕时自动谢绝群众代耕。五区故县十五个荣退军人为节省民力支援前线，在民校讨论代耕问题，群众正在没法解决这一问题时，他们都异口同声的提出再不用群众代耕，完全自己耕种，并提出有空时还要帮助群众种地。在他们影响下，各区荣退军人都提出不用群众代耕，并要在生产战线上再为人民立功。据不完全统计，三、五区及城关等二十多个荣退军人一百六十亩地可节省群众人畜力二千四百多工。（启明、生旺）
    【本报武安讯】城关区种棉，荣退军人起了模范作用。四街荣誉军人牛随堂一天担水三十一担，种花三分多。王有的赶着自己的骡自己装自己烧，半天帮助群众拉水八车。五街黄明起不仅自己劳动，动员自己老婆也下地担水十余担。此外王廷荣、冯子才等都起了模范作用，他们不仅自己干，并带领一组红火的干，群众都反映说：“人家在前方流血，回到后方还这样努力生产，咱怎能不加劲干。”退伍军人徐国瑛过去净等优待吃，这次特别积极，一天担水四十多担。群众都说：“老徐真不简单，以后有困难事，我们就要诚心帮助，可不能再一直嫌他讨厌。”现在全城关区由于荣退军人起模范，担水种苗运动搞的更加热火。（书璧）
