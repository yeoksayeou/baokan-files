Releasing Hands to Develop Guerrilla Warfare to Create Favorable Conditions for Counter-Offensive

　　On-the-Spot Persistence, Resolute Support, Letting Go and Mobilizing the Masses to Distribute Land
    Taihang Fourth Prefectural Committee Summarizes Experience in Land Distribution in Guerrilla Areas
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] The Taihang Fourth Prefectural Committee summarized the experience of mobilizing the masses to develop guerrilla warfare and put forward to the counties the task of struggling to consolidate the guerrilla base areas. At the beginning of last month, the Fourth Prefectural Committee held a joint meeting of county party committees to summarize the experience of the past two months. The main points are: First, only by persisting on the spot and boldly letting go to mobilize the masses can there be a mass-based guerrilla war of taking up guns in one hand and distributing land in the other. The so-called "guerrilla" that flies all over the sky without settling down for a certain period cannot mobilize the masses well. We cannot simply rely on persuasion to solve the masses' ideas of changing the world. More importantly, let the masses see from our actual struggles that we are truly determined to live and die with the masses, and work together. The masses in Wuzhi County said: We are not afraid of our leadership struggle, but afraid of our departure. This shows that the masses are eagerly demanding that we persist on the spot to support them and be the masters. Second, it is necessary to boldly let the armed work teams go out to actively engage the enemy, in order to improve their combat effectiveness, and at the same time support the mass movement, so that the movement can develop rapidly. Conservative views are very harmful. The facts in × County prove that the more you want to preserve or fear losses, the weaker the result will be, and the greater the possibility of suffering losses in changing situations. Third, it is necessary to correctly analyze the situation, grasp the situation, and not miss favorable opportunities to carry out work, but we cannot wait for the situation. We must analyze and grasp the situation on the premise of strengthening the struggle, and seize the opportunity to carry out work. Fourth, resolutely implement the resolutions of the higher-level Party, and combine the mass line with the implementation of resolutions. We cannot only see the negative and dark aspects of the masses and resist the resolutions of the higher-level authorities. Especially in the guerrilla environment, the leadership must always see the bright side of the masses' struggle in order to better implement the resolutions of the higher-level authorities, advance step by step, and win victory.
    Regarding future work, the prefectural committee also concentrated everyone's opinions and put forward the task of struggling to consolidate the guerrilla base areas, forcing the enemy into points and lines, and creating favorable conditions for a counter-offensive. The policy is still to let go and mobilize the masses to wage guerrilla warfare, combining the land reform movement with guerrilla warfare. The central link is to mobilize the masses to conduct counter-liquidation, implement land reform, and rapidly distribute land and wheat, protect land and wheat. In practice, it is to carry out the task of anti-traitor revenge, anti-liquidation, and implementation of land reform in one go, implementing land to the tillers and eliminating feudalism, without dividing it into stages. However, it must start with anti-traitor revenge and anti-liquidation. (Chen Ping)
    [Also News] Li Jiacheng, head of the Chengguan District of Qinyang City, was brave and decisive, and struggled resolutely. Last November, he led a work team to advance into Chengguan to carry out a mass guerrilla war. After engaging the enemy in the Qiliqiao area and forcing the enemy to retreat to the Shuibeiguan stronghold, not daring to come out in small groups, he boldly resided in Qiliqiao with the district office. In the action of engaging the enemy, he supported the masses, changing the initial hesitation and wait-and-see attitude of the masses towards us to a firm reliance. He carried out the movement of anti-liquidation, anti-traitor hegemony, and land reform in villages such as Qiliqiao, consolidated the border areas, and created experience in border guerrilla warfare and mobilizing the masses. The Fourth Special Commissioner's Office gave Li a major award, reported it to the Administrative Office, and issued a circular throughout the district to commend him.

　　就地坚持坚决撑腰放手发动群众分田
    太行四地委总结游击区分田经验
    【本报太行讯】太行四地委总结发动群众开展游击战争的经验，并向各县提出为巩固游击根据地而奋斗的任务。上月初四地委召开县委联席会，总结两个月来的经验，主要的是：一、只有就地坚持大胆放手的发动群众，才能有一手拿枪、一手分田的群众性的游击战争，不能在一定时期安顿下来的满天飞的所谓“游击”，是不能把群众很好的发动起来的。我们不能单纯的靠说服来解决群众的变天思想，更重要的是让群众从我们实际斗争中看到我们是真有决心要和群众同生死共患难，一块干的。武陟县群众就这样说：不是怕我们领导斗争，而是怕我们走。这就说明群众是迫切要求我们就地坚持撑腰作主的。二、要大胆放手的把武工队小股武装撒出去主动的接敌活动，才能提高其战斗力，同时也才能给群众运动撑腰，使运动迅速发展，保守观点是非常有害的，×县的事实证明，愈想保存或怕受损失，其结果愈软弱，在情况变化中遭受损失的可能愈大。三、要正确的分析形势、掌握形势，不失有利时机开展工作，但不能等待形势，必须在加强斗争的前提下，分析和掌握形势，抓紧时机开展工作。四、坚决执行上级党的决议，把走群众路线和执行决议结合起来，不能光看到群众消极的黑暗的方面而抵抗上级决议，特别在游击环境中，领导上要时时看到群众的光明斗争面才能很好的执行上级决议，步步前进，赢得胜利。
    关于今后工作，地委也集中了大家的意见，提出为巩固游击根据地而奋斗的任务，把敌人逼于点线，创造反攻有利条件。方针还是放手发动群众游击战争，把土地改革运动和游击战争结合起来，而中心环节是发动群众进行反倒算，实行土地改革，迅速分田、分麦，保田、保麦，在作法上是不分阶段的把反奸复仇、反倒算和贯彻土地改革，实行耕者有其田，消灭封建一口气的搞下来，但是必须由反奸复仇反倒算入手。（陈平）
    【又讯】沁阳城关区区长李加成，英勇果敢，坚决斗争，去年十一月率武工队挺进城关，开展群众性游击战争，在七里桥一带接敌活动，把敌逼于水北关据点，不敢小股出来活动之后，即率区公所大胆住在七里桥。在接敌行动中给群众撑了腰，改变群众初期对我之犹豫观望为坚决依靠。开展了七里桥等村的反倒算、反奸霸和土地改革运动，巩固了边地，创造了边地游击战争与发动群众的经验。四专署除给李记大功一次，报告行署外，并通令全区表扬。
