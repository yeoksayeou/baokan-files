(This article was transmitted by Taiyue on the 22nd) The Chiang Kai-shek troops besieged in Linfen are threatening to plunder grain for three to five months. Since late last month, they have been collecting remnants and practicing grain-snatching tactics in the city, reorganizing their grain-snatching institutions, and merging two to three villages into one township office. Each township has established a "bao police" (local security force) team of 30 to 50 people specifically for grain-snatching. They have also established grain-snatching base points in villages such as Sun Qiao, dispatching small groups of armed personnel to plunder. The grain requisitioned in each township has increased from 1.7 *dou* per *liang* of silver to 2.9 *dou*. Their methods of forced requisition are: first, when farmers are harvesting wheat, various intelligence personnel are sent out under the guise of helping the masses with the harvest to investigate the wheat harvest situation and grain storage locations in each township, in order to facilitate the plundering, and spreading deceptive propaganda saying: "Send the harvested grain into the city and the National Army will protect it for you." Second, local tyrants and bullies in the districts and townships, in coordination with the *bao* police, directly go to the individual households to forcibly requisition grain. Third, they rob or kidnap people for ransom, or carry out long-distance raids to capture people for extortion.

　　困守临汾蒋军四出下乡抢粮
    【本报太岳二十二日电】困守临汾蒋军，扬言要抢三个月至五个月的粮食。自上月下旬起，收集残部在城内演习抢粮动作，并整顿其抢粮机构，将两个至三个编村合编为一乡公所，各乡成立专事抢粮的保警队三十至五十人不等，并在孙乔等村设抢粮基点，派出小股武装四出抢掠。各乡征粮数目由每两粮银一石七斗增至两石九斗，其强征办法：一是于农民割麦时，派出各种情报人员以帮助群众收割为名，调查各乡麦收情况及藏粮地点，以便抢夺，并散布欺骗宣传说：“打下粮食送进城内国军替你保护。”二是以区乡土顽为主，配合保警队，直接到各花户强征。三是抢或拉肉票，或行远距离奔袭，捕人勒索。
