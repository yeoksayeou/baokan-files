Here Lies a Traitor
Remembering the Grave of Yuan Shikai, the Arch Thief of the Nation
Ke Gang

　　In the north of Anyang city, the five hundred mu of fertile land defiled for over thirty years by the bones of the arch thief of the nation, Yuan Shikai, has been liberated. At two o'clock on the morning of May 24th, the People's Liberation Army drove out the Chiang Kai-shek puppet Guo Qing bandit remnants from the solid fortifications here. At dawn, when the reporter arrived at this cemetery, residents of nearby villages were searching in and around the pine forest, among the large and small bunkers and fortifications destroyed by the People's Liberation Army, for things the enemy had looted from their homes. An old woman from Anyang Bridge, trembling with anger, held up a tattered, empty measuring container and said to the reporter: "These beasts snatched this from beside my stove the day before yesterday at dusk. It had three measures of rice in it. Since then, my family of five hasn't eaten any rice."

　　In the hundreds of acres of pine forest, magpies shot dead by bullets and broken branches were scattered everywhere. In the middle of the forest, there was a red-walled, green-tiled large building, with incense tables, candlesticks, and an interior decorated with terrazzo. At a glance, it exuded the traitorous atmosphere of a feudalistic, Western-worshipping hybrid, this was the grave of Yuan Shikai, the arch thief of the nation. Five square pillars formed five large gates, with the words "Oppose Chiang Thief's Treacherous Dictatorship" newly written by the People's Liberation Army across the top. After entering the gate, gray granite statues of horses, tigers, sheep, lions, and stone figures of officials were arranged on both sides. In front of the main hall stood a stone tablet more than two zhang tall, carved with openwork dragons on both sides, with "Tomb of the Great President Yuan Shikai" inscribed in the middle. It seemed as if those thieves and their descendants really wanted to decorate Yuan Shikai as a "true dragon emperor." But someone had already written "Arch Thief of the Nation" next to the words "Great President," and several local primary school students were using stones to strike the words "Great President."

　　Behind the main hall was a circular tomb mound made of cement, surrounded by stone lions. On top was a very sturdy bunker, which had been destroyed, with traces of enemy blood everywhere. Behind the tomb mound, someone had written a somewhat irregular line of words—"Here lies a traitor." Zhang Linhua, who had once been a clerk in the Beiyang 9th Division and was now an old man with white hair and missing teeth, nodded and smiled at this crooked line of words. I asked him, "Do you agree with this inscription?" He said with infinite emotion: "Of course, I retired in the fifth year of the Republic of China when Cai E launched the Yunnan Uprising. Leaving aside national affairs, he caused great suffering to the people in this area. This grave occupies more than five hundred mu of land, all of which belonged to the common people! Hu Shixin, a successful candidate in the imperial examinations from Anyang Bridge, was angered to death by this. The Yuans, relying on their wealth and power, engaged in usury all year round at that time. People within a radius of a hundred li had to use their money, with interest calculated quarterly at three percent. If they couldn't pay on time, they would be arrested and tortured, and many were forced to jump into wells or hang themselves. In that tall building" (he pointed to the Yuan residence to the west) "people died and were dragged out every day, all tortured to death!" Speaking of this, he looked up at the bunker and said in a drawn-out voice: "Well, this time old Chiang has exhausted all of Yuan Shikai's counter-revolutionary methods. Fortunately, Yuan Shikai's treachery at least resulted in a grave like this, where will old Chiang be buried in the future?" I said: "Old Chiang's ancestral grave is in America." He laughed loudly.

　　Crossing nearly a thousand meters of grassland, we arrived at the Yuan residence. In reality, this had been a military camp for decades, with high walls, strict defenses, and a forest of bunkers, completely lacking the atmosphere of a home. Chiang's puppet troops' corpses were lying all over the place, and the People's Liberation Army's burial team was busy burying them. In front of the Yuan residence, there were eight corpses of puppet bandits, facing the positions of the People's Liberation Army, lying neatly on the ground. I was surprised that they had died so orderly. The comrades from the burial team told me that this was because when Anyang ordered them to launch a final counterattack, they were afraid to advance and were machine-gunned to death by their officers. Indeed, when I examined their wounds, I found that every bullet had passed through their backs and out their chests. One of the older corpses had his head being frantically smashed with stones by several old people. When the burial team stopped them, they said: "Comrades, you don't know, this was a particularly bad squad leader. He abused too many women in Anyang Bridge."

　　这里埋着一个卖国贼
    记窃国大盗袁世凯墓
    柯岗
    在安阳城北，被窃国大盗袁世凯的骨头沾污了三十多年的五百亩良田解放了。五月二十四日早晨两点钟，人民解放军从这里的坚固工事里驱逐了蒋伪郭清残匪，拂晓记者赶到这座墓园的时候，附近村庄的居民，正在松林内外被解放军摧毁的大小碉堡和工事里寻找着敌人从他们家里抢来的东西。一个安阳桥的老太太气得双手发抖，拿着一个破旧的空升子对记者说：“这是前天黄昏，那些畜牲们从俺家炉灶边上抢来的。那时候这里边盛着三合米，从那时到如今，一家五口再没吃到米了。”
    几百亩大的松树林里，被枪弹打死的喜鹊和打断的枝叶狼藉遍地。林子中间，有一片红墙绿瓦，香案烛台，而又用水门汀装饰了内部的大房子，一眼看去，一片封建加洋奴中西合造的卖国贼气派，这便是窃国大盗袁世凯的墓了。五个方柱子格成了五个大门，横额是人民解放军刚刚写上的“反对蒋贼卖国独裁”八个大字。进门之后两边排列着灰色麻石雕成的马、虎、羊、狮和翁仲像。大殿之前一座两丈多高的石碑，前后雕满了透花的青龙，中间刻有“大总统袁世凯之墓”。看样子好像那些贼子贼孙们真想把袁世凯装饰成一个“真龙天子”似的。可是不知是谁已经在“大总统”三个字旁写上了“窃国大盗”四字，并有好几个当地的小学生正用石块挫打着“大总统”三字。
    大殿之后，是一个圆形的水泥砌成的墓冢，周围满布石狮子，顶上有一座非常坚固的碉堡，已经被摧毁，到处都是敌人的血迹。墓冢背后有人写了一行不很整齐的字——“这里埋着一个卖国贼”。曾经在北洋第九师当过录事的张林华，已经是发白齿落的老人了，现在他对着这一行歪斜的小字点头微笑。我问他“你也同意这样写吗”？他无限感慨的说：“当然同意，我就是在民国五年蔡松坡云南起义时退伍的。不说国家大事吧，就他在俺这一带也把人毁痛了。这个坟占地五百多亩，全是老百姓的呀！安阳桥的举人胡士信，就是为这气死的。袁家的人仗着有钱有势，那时候整年放高利贷，方圆百十里都得使他的钱，利钱三分按季计算，到时出不起就要抓去受刑罚，多少人被逼的投井上吊。就在那高房子里”（他指着西面的袁宅）“天天有死人往外拉，都是受刑死的呀”！说到这里，他抬头看着碉堡，拉长声音：“好啦，老蒋这回可把袁世凯反革命的手段都使尽了。总算不坏，袁世凯卖国还落个这样的坟，将来老蒋往那里埋呢？”我说：“老蒋的祖坟在美国。”他大声笑起来。
    越过将近一千公尺的草地到了袁宅，这里实际上已经是数十年的兵营了，高墙森严，堡垒林立，毫无家宅气味。蒋伪遗尸遍地人民解放军的掩埋组正在忙着掩埋，在袁宅门前，有八个伪匪的尸体，面向着解放军的阵地，很整齐的躺在地上。我奇怪他们死的太有次序，掩埋组的同志告诉我这是安阳命令他们最后一次反扑的时候，他们不敢前进，被官长们用机枪扫死了的。确实当我看他们伤时，发现每颗子弹都是从脊背穿过前胸的。其中有一俱年纪较大的尸体，几个老百姓用石块拚命砸他的脑袋，当掩埋组制止他们时，他们说：“同志们不知道，这是顶坏的一个班长，他在俺安阳桥糟踏妇女太多了。”
