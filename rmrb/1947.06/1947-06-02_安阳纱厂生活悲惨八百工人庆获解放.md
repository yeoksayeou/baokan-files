[By Telegraph from the Northern Henan Front of this Newspaper, 30th] Eight hundred workers at the Guangyi Cotton Mill in northern Anyang city welcomed the People's Liberation Army with boundless enthusiasm after the mill was liberated by the People's Liberation Army on the 16th. Under the threat of enemy aircraft, they boiled water and washed the PLA soldiers stationed at the factory. They denounced the oppression of the workers by the Chiang Kai-shek's representatives at the factory, who frequently delayed paying workers' wages. The wages for the latter half of April and this month have not been paid. During the battle, workers were forced to work on empty stomachs, spinning all the accumulated cotton into yarn, which was all taken away by plane the week before. The factory manager also took the opportunity to flee. One worker pointed to a bag of millet and said sadly, "We are more than a dozen people, and we were only given this bag of millet. How are we supposed to live?" The factory was founded by the national traitor Yuan Shikai in the first year of the Xuantong era. It is large in scale, with 72 original spinning machines and a capacity for 4,000 workers, with each machine producing 320 jin per day. During the Japanese occupation, 60 machines were removed, and the factory was managed by Japanese at that time. Last spring, it was "taken over" and operated by the Kuomintang government, and the control over the workers was even more severe than during the Japanese occupation. The factory was full of secret agents, and workers were not free to enter or leave the factory. In addition to forcing workers to work for twelve hours, they also had to build fortifications for the "Chiang troops." The living conditions of the workers were generally lower than during the Japanese occupation. In terms of form, the monthly wages and grain during the "takeover" period could barely maintain personal life at the then-current prices, but soon prices soared, and wages could not keep up with the rise in prices. A miscellaneous worker could exchange his wage for three dou of wheat during the wheat season last year, but now it has been reduced to two dou, so most workers are often in a state of hunger. Some female textile workers receive as little as sixty jin of wheat per month, and their miserable situation can be imagined.

　　安阳纱厂生活悲惨八百工人庆获解放
    【本报豫北前线卅日电】安阳城北广益纱厂，于十六日为人民解放军解放后，该厂八百工人以无限热情欢迎人民解放军。他们在敌机威胁下，为驻守该厂的解放军战士烧水洗澡。他们控诉该厂蒋记负责人压迫工人的情形，该厂经常拖欠工人工资，四月后半月及本月份工资就没有发。在战斗期间还强迫工人饿着肚子上工，将全部积存棉花纺成纱线，周前用飞机悉数载走。厂方负责人亦乘机逃之夭夭。一个工人指着一袋小米，很凄苦地说：“我们十多个人，只给了这一袋小米，怎么活下去呢？”该厂系国贼袁世凯于宣统元年所创立。规模宏大，原有纺纱机七十二部，容纳工人达四千之众，每部机器每日生产量为三百二十斤。日本强盗占领期间，已搬走六十部，当时管理该厂者均为日人。去春为国民党政府“接收”经营，对工人的统治较日本强盗时更为严厉，工人中满布特务，进出工厂极不自由。除强迫工人劳作十二小时外，还要为“蒋军”构筑工事。工人生活一般较日本强盗统治时期更为低降。就形式上看“接收”时期每月工资粮按当时物价还能勉强维持个人生活，不久物价飞涨，工资赶不上物价的上涨。一个杂工去年麦季工资尚能换得三斗麦子，而现在已降低到两斗，故大部工人常处于饿饥状态。纺织女工有每月低至六十斤麦的，其悲惨状况可想而知。
