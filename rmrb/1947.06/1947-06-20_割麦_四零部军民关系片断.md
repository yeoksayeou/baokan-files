Harvesting Wheat
Fragments of the Military-Civilian Relationship of the 40th Unit
The Old Woman's Tears and Laughter

　　After breakfast, Squad Leader Tao of the machine gun company of the "401" Unit led six soldiers out of ×× Village, heading southwest along the road. They shouted, "...sharing weal and woe, sharing difficulties, engaging in production and fighting, sacrificing our lives... for the masses... to liberate our parents!" Everyone's face was filled with happy smiles.

　　An old woman with gray hair, about fifty years old, sat in the wheat field, slowly pulling wheat with her withered hands. Squad Leader Tao went up to her and asked, "Old woman, how much wheat did your family plant?" "I only have four mu. I pulled it all day yesterday and only pulled this little bit (she pointed to a small area of land), and my hands are sore!... My old man died and left a small child,... alas!..." As she spoke, her tears rolled down! "Old woman, don't cry! We are here to help you harvest the wheat." Squad Leader Tao comforted her like a son to his mother. The comrades were deeply moved. So they started working. Some pulled with their hands, and some cut with sickles. She rubbed her eyes, stopped crying, and immediately said with a smile, "When my old man was alive, he said the Eighth Route Army was good, and we would have a way out when the Eighth Route Army came! We really waited for them!" The comrades listened and worked even harder, and more than three mu of wheat were harvested in one go.

Hands Faster Than Sickles!

　　On the 23rd, under the scorching sun, the directly subordinate team of the "400" Unit helped the villagers with the wheat harvest. Sweat soaked their clothes, but no one took a break. Deputy Political Commissar Qin, short and capable, rolled up his sleeves, pulling wheat while talking and laughing. He called on everyone, "Pull with your hands if you don't have a sickle!" Everyone shouted, "Hands are faster than sickles!" The villagers brought several boxes of cigarettes and offered them one by one, but the comrades all shook their heads and said, "Take them back! We don't smoke that!" The villagers said disappointedly, "If you don't smoke, I feel bad!" After the comrades of the 3rd Machine Gun Company arrived at the wheat field, each person took four rows and put forward the competition slogan: "See who pulls fast? Who pulls clean? See who gets to the end first?" The enthusiasm for work was as hot as the scorching sun. Comrade Jia Tingdong was in the lead, and Wang Zengdi's one hand was full of scabies, but the other hand flew so fast! Everyone shouted, "Pull! Learn from Comrade Jia!" Laughing and pulling, beads of sweat the size of soybeans fell from their heads into the wheat field, and the more they worked, the more energetic they became. Some simply took off their tops and threw their hats on the wheat pile, unwilling to fall behind. In less than two hours, they completed more than four mu. The old woman brought white flour buns and boiled water, shouting, "Comrades, take a break, eat something before continuing!" But she shouted several times, but no one rested, and no one ate the buns, only drank a few sips of water, and then went back to work. She murmured, "If you don't eat my family's food, I'll really be unhappy!"

　　割麦
    四零部军民关系片断
  老太太的哭与笑
    吃罢早饭，“四零一”部机枪连陶班长领着六个战士出了××村，朝西南沿着大路走去。他们嘴里嚷着说：“……有苦同受，有难同当，生产、打仗，不惜自己的生命……为了群众……为了解救自己的爹娘！”每个人的脸上都洋溢着愉快的笑。
    一个花白了头发，约摸五十来岁的老太婆坐在麦田里，用那枯瘦的手慢慢地拔着麦子。陶班长迎上去问道：“老太太你家种了多少麦子？”“我只有四亩。昨天拔了一整天，就拔了这么一点点（她说时指着那一分来地）手也拔疼了！………我老汉死了，丢下了一个小孩孩，……咳！……”说着、说着她的眼泪滚出来了！“老太太，不要哭了！我们就是来帮忙你老人家收麦的。”陶班长像亲儿子对母亲似的安慰她。同志们的心坎里都深深的感动了。于是就干起来了。有的用手拔，有的拿镰割，她揉了揉眼睛，止住了哭泣，登时笑嘻嘻的说：“我老汉在世时就说八路军好，八路军一来咱就有办法啦！当真盼来了！”同志们听着更加油干了，三亩多麦一口气收完了。
  手比镰刀还快！
    “四零零”部直属队二十三日在火似的阳光下，助老乡麦收，汗水湿透了衣服，谁也不去休息。短小精悍的秦副政委，卷起了袖子，说着笑着拔着麦，他号召：“没有镰刀用手拔！”大家嘴里吵嚷：“手比镰刀快！”老乡拿了几盒纸烟来，一个一个的让，同志们都摇摇头说：“快拿回去吧！我们都不吸那个！”老乡怏怏的说：“你们不吸烟！我心里过不去！”机枪三连的同志们到了麦地以后，每人都摊了四行，提出了竞赛口号：“看谁拔的快？拔的净？看谁先到头？”工作的热情和火似的太阳一般热。贾廷栋同志在最前头，王增弟一只手长满了疥疮，另一只手却飞得那么快！大家喊着“拔呀！向贾同志看齐！”笑的笑，拔的拔，黄豆般大的汗珠，一粒一粒从头上掉到麦地里，工作越带劲头越大。有的索性脱了上衣，把帽子摔到麦堆上，谁也不肯落后。没到两个钟头，就完成了四亩多。老太太端来了白面馍馍，提来了开水，喊着：“同志休息下子，吃点再干！”可是她喊了几遍，却没有人休息，也没人吃馍，只喝了几口水，又给干起来了。她＠着嘴说：“你们不吃我家饭，我真不乐意！”
