Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Shanghai newspapers reported: More than 100 people from Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, including Ma Yinchu, Yu Chenghuan, Sheng Pihua, Sun Xiaocun, and Zhang Naiqi, held a "Discussion Meeting on the Current Social Crisis" on the 22nd of last month. Hu Jue-wen chaired the meeting, and after Zhang Naiqi read out the outline of the review point by point, he said, "If we middle-aged people don't speak up again, are we really going to hand over the responsibility of speaking to the young people?" An economics Ph.D. pointed out the current crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas with specific figures: "In 1936, the currency issued was about 1.4 billion, and in 1946, prices rose 8,000 times compared to 1936. By the end of April this year, prices had risen to 30,000 times, and the currency issued had increased to 3.5 trillion, an increase of 2,500 times. Prices rose 8,000 times, and prices rose three times faster than issuance. The currency issued is now about 6.5 trillion, an increase of 5,000 times, then prices are six times faster than issuance. From this, it can be seen that the more the currency inflates, the more prices rise, and the future is very dangerous." The Ph.D. also stated: "The 'government's' (referring to the Chiang government) total budget for this year was originally set at 7 trillion in revenue and 9.3 trillion in expenditure, but was later changed to 17 trillion in revenue and 20 trillion in expenditure. This year, the Chiang government's tax revenue is about 10 trillion, and total expenditure requires 40 trillion. Issuing 'US Dollar Bonds' will at most be 3.6 trillion, because the public bonds of 1 trillion are paid in US dollars and have nothing to do with Chiang currency. As of now, various sectors have subscribed to 1 trillion, and half of it has not been paid. I don’t know how much currency will be issued to make up for these deficits." The participants unanimously agreed that the fundamental and real reason for high prices is only two bloody words: "Civil War." Currency inflation is indeed terrible, but even more terrible is the lack of supplies. If the civil war continues, there will be an even greater lack of supplies.

　　财政经济呈恶性循环
    正加速蒋家朝廷危机
    【新华社陕北二十日电】沪报讯：沪工商界马寅初、俞澄寰、盛丕华、孙晓村、章乃器等百余人，于上月二十二日举行“当前社会危机检讨会”。由胡厥文主席，章乃器逐条宣读检讨大纲后说：“我们中年人再不说话，难道真的把一切说话的责任交给青年人吗？”某经济学博士以具体数字指出目前蒋区危机：“一九三六年通货发行约为十四亿，一九四六年物价较三六年上涨八千倍。本年四月底止，物价已涨至三万倍，通货发行增至三万五千亿，增二千五百倍，物价涨八千倍，物价比发行快三倍，通货发行约为六万五千亿，增五千倍，则物价比发行快六倍。由此可见通货愈膨胀，物价愈上涨，前途非常危险。”该博士又称：“本年度‘政府’（指蒋政府）总预算原定收入七万亿，支出九万三千亿，后改为收入十七万亿，支出二十万亿。今年蒋政府税收收入约为十万亿，支出共需四十万亿，发行‘美金债券’，充其量不过三万六千亿，因公债一万亿以美金收付与蒋币无关，至目前各界认购者一万亿，尚有二分之一未缴款，这些亏空数字又不知要发行多少通货来弥补。”与会人士一致认为物价高涨的基本的真正原因，只有两个血腥大字“内战”，通货膨胀固可怕，更可怕的是物资缺乏，内战再打下去，物资也更缺乏。
