Elementary School Teacher Shi Chuanpin
Promotes Production and Prosperity

After the masses in Buli Village, Fourth District of Shimin, realized "land to the tiller," a few former middle peasants had the idea of being "afraid of getting rich." Therefore, they did not engage in production properly, going to bed early and getting up late, not working actively. They thought that being able to maintain the existing land was enough, and there was no benefit to doing more. Some turned-over households who gained fruits and became middle peasants had the idea of "not wanting to get rich," thinking that being a middle peasant was enough to have food and clothing, and doing more would prevent them from being basic masses. This idea of ​​being proud of poverty also hindered bold efforts to get rich and active labor. After elementary school teacher Shi Chuanpin understood this situation, he compiled many propaganda pieces to break the idea of ​​fearing getting rich, and advocating labor, starting a business and getting rich, such as:

(1) Land to the tiller has been realized,
Houses and land have returned home,
Everyone helps each other to produce together,
Don’t be afraid to get rich.

(2) Production must be grasped tightly after turning over,
Getting land only counts as turning over half of your body.
Work hard to catch up with Shi Zhenming,
Only when you are well-fed and clothed can you be completely turned over.

He taught the students to memorize and discuss, so that the students could understand clearly first, and then go home to promote and chat with their fathers, mothers, relatives, and neighbors. Singing and talking fast board…

He Bingzhi, a second-grade student, went home to promote to his father and uncle. His father said, "I didn't dare to engage in production before, because I was afraid of causing trouble if I didn't do well. Now I know that working to get rich is the most glorious. I will produce well in the future and will no longer think wildly." His grandfather, who was more than sixty years old, never went to the fields in the past, but now he goes to plow the fields before dawn. Comrade Shi Chuanpin compiled this into a rhyming dialogue and praised him in a timely manner on the public blackboard. In addition to general propaganda, he used the specific facts of the village to compile fast board rhymes to break the specific concerns of the masses in a way that was objective and not targeted at individuals. He found that Chai ×× of Bajian Gully was afraid that there would be struggle even after he got rich, so he compiled a section of fast board rhyme, and compared him with the fact that He Yuanlu in the village started a business through labor and was not struggled against: "Some people can't figure it out, afraid of getting rich through production. If they work hard and do well, they still feel that they shouldn't. He Yuanlu in our village got rich through labor, and not only was he not struggled against, but people also said that he was a hero." After such propaganda, people who were afraid of struggle and did not dare to get rich changed their minds and actively engaged in production. Chai ×× of Bajian Gully also joined the mutual aid team. He ××, a loafer, went from door to door all day long, not wanting to go to the fields. His woman taught him to cut firewood. He took the grain stalks (one catty sold for six yuan) back to burn as firewood. His woman advised him, but he wouldn't listen. Comrade Shi Chuanpin compiled his facts into two scenes of a square drama, "Watching and Changing" and "Wife Persuades Husband," only acting out the facts without naming names, and performing during lunch breaks or mass gatherings. The loafer He ×× did change his ways and actively participated in the mutual aid team to work.

The masses' idea of fearing getting rich has been broken, and the enthusiasm for production is higher than in previous years. In less than ten days, twelve mutual aid teams have been restored, and one hundred and fifty male full and semi-labor forces have joined the mutual aid teams. Comrade Shi Chuanpin also promoted the administrative office's regulations on rewarding production, compiled them into rhyming dialogues and songs for the students to sing, so that each mutual aid team launched a competition movement. Activist Tian Bicheng and his wife set out a plan according to their family and issued a challenge, "The man guarantees that the woman will not eat chaff, and the woman guarantees that the man will not wear torn clothes."

The ideological concerns of the masses in Shili Village have been broken, and the mutual aid teams have been completely restored, but the land of military cadres, families of martyrs, and civilians who went to the front line to participate in the war in the village, who do not have labor, cannot be planted. In order to reduce the lack of labor and encourage civilians to participate in the war on the front line, Comrade Shi Chuanpin mobilized thirty-nine children over the age of twelve in the school to divide into three groups, organize them, help family production, and help military families. After discussion, the students put forward three model conditions to strive for:

(1) Do our best to help each other in labor, not be naughty, not be lazy, and guarantee to do well.

(2) Be able to complete the task according to the plan of combining learning and production.

(3) Be able to play a certain propaganda role in this natural village and be able to promote everyone.

The children first helped family production, and then helped poor military families and civilians participating in the war who had no labor. From March 12 to April 12, in one month, they sent a total of 7,880 loads of manure and cut 9,750 catties of firewood, and sent 620 loads of manure and cut 1,425 catties of firewood to 12 military families. (The statistics of the participating civilians have not yet been completed). The masses reflected that "children are organized and can do great things." It saved the labor burden of full labor force preferential treatment to military families and helping civilians participating in the war. The masses welcomed it, the cadres welcomed it, the families of the civilians participating in the war welcomed it, and the parents of the children also welcomed it. School production played an important role in promoting the solution of labor shortage. The families of the civilians wrote letters to the front line, "Teaching him to rest assured to participate in the war on the front line, and the teachers and children in the family have planted the land." The civilians on the front line were energetic in participating in the war, and the production in the village was not delayed. Organizing children and other semi-labor forces to help each other in production cannot be ignored.

When the children were in production, they used the method of teaching and learning to carry out learning. Every other day, one person from each group went to school to learn, and when they returned to the group, they used their rest time to teach others. The older children wrote diaries every day. When it was the second person's turn to study, they reported the learning results of each person, and the whole group went to school for a test every five days. The children under the age of ten (a total of 19) were divided into two groups, attending classes in the morning and helping family production in the afternoon. The masses reflected that "learning and production are not delayed, this is a good method." (Reprinted from the Special Issue of the Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Office of Culture and Education)

### 小学教员史传品  宣传生产发家

　　小学教员史传品
    宣传生产发家
    士敏四区卜里村群众在实现耕者有其田以后，少数旧中农脑子里存在着“怕发财”的思想。所以就不好好闹生产，每天早睡迟起不积极劳动。他们认为能保持住现有的土地就行了，闹得多了没好处。还有个别得到果实上升为中农的翻身户存在着“不愿发财”思想，认为当个中农有吃有穿就可以，再闹得多了，当不上基本群众。这种以贫为荣的思想也阻碍着大胆发财，积极劳动的行动。小学教员史传品同志了解了这个情况以后，就编了许多打破怕发财思想，和提倡劳动、起家发财致富的宣传品，像：
    （一）耕者有其田实现啦，
    房屋土地回了家，
    大家互助齐生产，
    发财致富莫要怕。
    （二）翻身后生产要抓紧，
    得了土地只算翻了半个身。
    努力生产赶上石振明，
    丰衣足食才算全翻身。
    教学生念会并进行讨论，使学生先认识清楚了然后回家和父亲、母亲、亲戚、邻居宣传漫谈。唱歌说快板……。
    二年级学生何丙芝回家向他父亲舅舅宣传，他父亲说：“我以前不敢闹生产，怕闹不好了惹麻烦，现在知道劳动发家最光荣，今后要好好生产，再不胡思乱想了”。他祖父六十多岁，过去不上地，现在天不明就去犁地。史传品同志就编了板话在大众黑板上及时表扬。他除进行一般的宣传以外，拿村上的具体事实编成快板用对事不对人的方法打破群众的具体顾虑。他发现八尖沟柴××怕发了财还要斗争，他就编了一段快板，并拿村上何元洛劳动起家没斗他的事实给他比较：“有些人想不开，害怕生产发了财，自己劳动闹好了，他还觉得不应该，咱村何元洛劳动发了财，不但没斗争还说人家是英雄。”经这样宣传以后，怕斗争不敢发财的人转变了，都积极生产起来，八尖沟柴××也参加了互助组。二流子何××整天串门，不想下地，他女人教他去割柴火，他把谷草（一斤卖洋六元）拿回来当柴烧，他女人劝他，他不听，史传品同志就把他的事实编成“看过改”“妻劝夫”两幕广场剧，只演事实不指名字，利用午间或群众集会时表演。二流子何××果然改过了，积极的参加互助组去劳动。
    群众怕发财思想打破了，生产情绪比往年更加热烈高涨，不到十天工夫，十二个互助组都恢复起来，一百五十个男全半劳动力参加了互助组。史传品同志又宣传行署的奖励生产条例，编成板话歌子让学生唱，这样各个互助组挑起竞赛运动。积极分子田必成和他女人定出按家计划，并提出挑战，“男人保证女人不吃糠，女人保证男人不穿烂衣裳。”
    十里村群众的思想顾虑打破了，互助组完全恢复起来，可是村上军干烈属，以及到前方参战的民夫，家里没有劳动力的土地还不能种，史传品同志为减少劳力缺乏和鼓励前线参战民夫，他动员住校三十九个十二岁以上的儿童分成三组，组织起来，帮助家庭生产帮助军属，学生讨论后提出三个争取模范条件：
    （一）尽各人的力量互助劳动，不调皮，不偷懒，保证做得好。
    （二）能按学习生产结合的计划完成任务。
    （三）能在本自然村，起一定的宣传作用并能推动大家。
    儿童们首先帮助家庭生产，然后帮助贫苦无劳力的军烈属及参战民夫，从三月十二日开始到四月十二日，一个月时间共送粪七千八百八十担，割柴九千七百五十斤，给十二家军属送粪六百二十担，割柴一千四百二十五斤。（参战夫的尚未统计），群众反映说：“小孩子组织起来，能顶大事。”省了全劳力优军和帮助参战民夫的劳力负担，群众欢迎，干部欢迎，参战民夫家属欢迎，儿童家长亦欢迎。学校生产推动解决劳力缺乏起了重要作用。民夫家属给前方写信“教他安心在前方参战，家里的地教员儿童给种上了。”民夫前方参战劲头大，村上的生产又不耽误，组织儿童等半劳力互助生产是不可忽视的。
    儿童在生产时，用传学制的方法，进行学习，每隔一天，各组有一个人到学校学习，回到组里利用休息时间，再教旁人，大的儿童每天作日记。轮到第二个人学习时，汇报各人学习成绩，五天全组到校测验一次。十岁以下的儿童（共十九个）分成两组上午上课，下午帮助家庭生产，群众反映说：“学习生产两不误，这是个好办法。”（转载自太岳四专署文教会特刊）
