　　Resolute, Calm, Wise, and Courageous:
    Shi Lailiang, Repeatedly Selected as a Special-Class Meritorious Hero
    Feng Mu
    The famous combat hero Shi Lailiang achieved remarkable feats in the Jin-nan Campaign and was selected twice as a special-class people's meritorious hero. After he gave a typical report to all the meritorious heroes at the commendation meeting, the audience responded with warm applause and cheers: "Shi Lailiang is our banner!" Shi Lailiang is a liberated peasant from Jincheng. He has been in the army for less than a year. He was timid when he first participated in combat. However, due to his eagerness to learn, he gradually mastered combat skills and personally experienced in battle that the enemy was not scary, but what was scary was ignorance of the enemy's actual combat capabilities. In the Chenyan battle, he established his first military merit by capturing Huang Zhengcheng, the brigade commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army's First Brigade, along with everyone else. In the battle in a village near Xiaoyi, under snowy conditions and a disparity in firepower between the enemy and ourselves, he and three other warriors defended a position only twenty meters away from the enemy for a full day and night. After the Fen-Xiao Campaign, he was selected as a special-class people's meritorious hero for the first time. The most prominent characteristic of the hero Shi Lailiang is that he can not only fight heroically and exceptionally in victorious situations but also conduct an indomitable struggle against the enemy with firmness and calmness in the most critical battles.
    During a recent battle near Anyi in southern Shanxi, he and a very small number of troops encountered a six-pronged encirclement by a large number of enemies. He repelled three enemy assaults with three hand grenades, covering the safe withdrawal of the deputy battalion commander and platoon deputy who were near him in the face of dense enemy fire. Only when the enemy was frantically moving about four or five meters away from him did he calmly throw out the last hand grenade and retreat in the smoke. During the transfer to another position, a dozen enemy light and heavy machine guns fired at them in unison. The deputy battalion commander was wounded, and Shi Lailiang was also shot in the foot, but he fought and retreated, not only reaching the destination five kilometers away safely but also rescuing the deputy battalion commander from the dense fire.
    Shi Lailiang also achieved great success in educating new soldiers. When he was appointed as a squad leader, most of the squad members were new soldiers who were somewhat timid about combat. However, under Shi Lailiang's patient education, they quickly became courageous fighters. His main methods were: 1. To continuously conduct ideological education based on his own personal experience of how he transformed from a timid soldier into a combat hero and his own experience of liberation. 2. To continuously conduct practical combat education based on everything they saw on the battlefield. For example, when he saw a wounded soldier, he immediately used this example to explain the importance of building fortifications and dispersing formations to the new soldiers. When he heard the sound of artillery, he explained to the new soldiers the performance of mountain guns and mortars, the muzzle velocity, and how to hide, etc. 3. To influence the new soldiers with his own exemplary spirit. For example, when digging fortifications during a battle north of Yuncheng, he always chose to dig in the hardest soil and did the most work. When he was sick during training, he still led the soldiers to work hard, even when he was too sick to move, he still forced himself to sit in the courtyard and teach the soldiers shooting postures.
    Shi Lailiang's care and love for his comrades touched every soldier. During a battle near Yuncheng, they were building fortifications under intense enemy fire when the fortifications suddenly collapsed, burying Shi Lailiang and soldier Yan Wanqing in the soil. The soldiers rushed to rescue Shi Lailiang, but he endured the pain and said, "Don't save me, save him first, he is buried deeper than me." By the time they were rescued, the soldier was already unconscious. At this time, the enemy's artillery fire suddenly intensified, and shells landed near their fortifications. Some people had already hidden in the fortifications, but Shi Lailiang risked his life and did not leave the wounded soldier, saying while giving emergency treatment, "Even if the shells injure me, I must save him!" Finally, he rescued the soldier under fire and sent him to a safe area.
    The soldiers in the company all said: "As long as Shi Lailiang takes the lead, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve victory!" Now the voice of "Learn from Shi Lailiang" can be heard everywhere in the troops, and the "Shi Lailiang Movement" is underway. (Taiyue Branch)

　　坚定沉着智勇双全
    连选特等功臣时来亮
    冯牧
    著名战斗英雄时来亮，晋南战役中功勋卓著，二次被选为特等人民功臣。当他在贺功大会上向全体功臣作了典型报告之后，台下报以热烈的鼓掌与欢呼：“时来亮是我们的旗帜”！时来亮是晋城的翻身农民，参军迄今尚不满一年，初次参加战斗时，他很胆怯。但由于他的虚心学习，逐渐熟练了战斗技术，并在战斗中亲身体验到了敌人并不可怕，可怕的是那种对于敌人的实际作战力的无知。在陈堰战斗中，他第一次建立了战功，和大家活捉了蒋军第一旅旅长黄正成；在孝义某村战斗中，在冰天雪地及敌我火力悬殊情况下，和另外三名勇士，坚守某一距敌二十米达的阵地一天一夜之久。汾、孝战役后，他第一次被选为特等人民功臣。英雄时来亮最显著的特点是：不仅在胜利的情况中能够英勇卓绝地作战，而且在最危急的战斗中，也能够坚定沉着地和敌人进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    此次在晋南安邑附近某次战斗中，他和极少数部队遭遇了大量敌人的六路围攻，他以三颗手榴弹打溃了敌人三次突击，掩护了在他附近的副营长和排副在密集的敌人面前安全撤下，等到敌人已经疯狂地蠢动离他四五公大远时，他才镇定地投出最后一颗手榴弹，在硝烟中撒回来。在向另一阵地转移途中，敌人十几挺轻重机枪向他们齐射，副营长挂彩了，时来亮脚上也中了一个子弹，但他且战且走，不但安全到达了五里路外的目的地，并且把副营长从密集的火力中抢救了出来。
    时来亮在教育新战士上，也得到了极大的成绩。当他被任命为班长时，班里绝大部分都是新战士，对于作战有些畏怯，但在时来亮的谆谆教育下，很快都变成了勇于战斗的人。他的主要方法是：一、以他自己如何从一个胆怯兵变成了战斗英雄的切身经历和自己翻身的事实来进行不断的思想教育。二、以战场上他们所看见的每一件事情来进行不断的实战教育。如他看见了一个伤员，便立即以这一实例向新战士说明作工事和疏散队形的重要；听见了炮响，便向新战士说明山炮和迫击炮的性能、出口速度以及如何隐蔽的方法等。三、以他自己的模范精神来影响新战士。如在运城北某次战斗中挖工事，他总是挑土最硬的地方挖，并作得最多；练兵时他生病了，但他依然带着战士们奋力苦练，直到他病得不能动了，他还是勉强坐在院子里教战士们的射击姿势。
    时来亮对他的战友们的关怀与友爱，感动了每一个战士。在运城附近战斗中，他们在敌人密集的炮火下作工事，突然工事坍了，把时来亮和战士阎万庆压在土里，战士们争着来救时来亮，但他忍着疼痛说：“你们不要救我，先救他，他压得比我重。”等他们被救出来时，那个战士已经昏迷不醒。这时敌人的炮火突然猛烈起来，炮弹就落在他们工事附近，有的人都躲进了工事，但时来亮却冒着危险，一步也没有离开这个被压伤的战士，他一面进行着急救，一面说：“纵然炮弹把我打伤，我也不能不把他救活！”终于在炮火下把战士救活转来，并且送到了安全的地区去。
    连上的战士们都说：“只要有时来亮带头，我们就可以战胜一切艰险，取得胜利！”现在部队中到处都可以听到“向时来亮学习”的声音，学习“时来亮运动”正在开展着。（太岳分社）
