Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: A compilation of news from 평진 newspapers last month reveals that due to the Chiang government's frantic conscription of military grain, North China and the Northeast Chiang-controlled areas are entirely submerged in famine. Last month in Tianjin, flour reached a peak price of 415,000 per bag, a tenfold increase compared to the 40,000 at the beginning of January. During the same period, rice in Beiping cost 5,100 per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), and flour was 230,000 per bag, both double the January market price. The famine has spread to small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas. Grain has disappeared from places like Jinghai and Tangguantun (note: this area was liberated this month). In Duliu Town near Tianjin, the price of wheat exceeded 5,200 per sheng (approximately 1 liter) on the market day of the third of last month. Not only are the vast majority of citizens, students, and professors starving, but even Chiang's civil servants and police cannot maintain a livelihood. On the 24th of last month, two military police officers in Beiping committed suicide because of this. Grain prices in Qingdao and Kaifeng have skyrocketed, leading to anti-hunger struggles by all professors, students, and primary and secondary school teachers at Shandong University and Henan University. Qingdao policeman Li Guiqing and his wife even sold their infant son, less than five months old, to buy rice. Grain prices in Taiyuan are even higher than in 평진. In mid-May, wheat rose to 4,200 per liter, and by May 25th, rice was selling for 800,000 per shi (approximately 50 kg), and millet also rose to 460,000 per shi. To alleviate the famine, the Chiang government decided to transport 20,000 tons of grain from the Northeast to 평진 each month. However, according to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, the famine in the Northeast Chiang-controlled areas is also very serious. In Xiuyan County, Andong Province (later liberated), during the Chiang occupation, 130,000 out of the county's 300,000 people were starving. Dozens were dying of hunger every day, and entire families were committing suicide by poison, and selling children was commonplace. In Shenyang, sorghum rice cost 20 yuan (equivalent to 260 yuan in "法币") per jin in early February (流通券 compared to "法币" was thirteen to one), but by mid-May, it had risen to over 120 yuan. Ta Kung Pao said that the Northeast (referring to the Chiang-controlled area), which was considered a "rice granary," is now "completely empty." The Chiang government also intends to transport grain from the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, ruled by Fu Zuoyi, to 평진. However, the famine in Suiyuan is no less severe than in 평진. In Guisui, from April 23rd to May 3rd, the price of flour rose from 600 to 1,500 per jin, an increase of 150% in ten days. The situation is even more serious in the western counties of Suiyuan. Linhe County, which produces more grain, has already requested grain relief, and in Yanjiang County, even with money, it is impossible to buy grain. The situation is the same in the Chiang-controlled areas of Chahar Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th: A compilation of news from Shanghai newspapers reveals that Jiangxi, known as the "granary," is experiencing an extremely severe famine as a result of the Chiang government's plundering of military grain. Yongxin County in western Jiangxi, which used to have a surplus of grain for export, is now filled with refugees. Chen Xiduo and his wife, residents of Litian Town in the county, hanged themselves due to unbearable hunger; Hu Xianting of Heyi Township committed suicide by poison with his entire family of six because of high grain prices and no way to borrow money; Chen Xun and his wife of Shashi Township poisoned their entire family because their children were constantly crying from hunger. Even formerly well-off families are now barely surviving on two meals of thin porridge a day. Farmers in Anfu County and the Xijiang area are universally eating tree bark and wild grass. The counties on the eastern shore of Poyang Lake, which used to have enough surplus grain to supply more than ten counties, are now also suffering from hunger.

Also: The price of rice in Fuzhou has recently risen to over 500,000 yuan per shi. A slogan on a small bridge wall in the city reads: "Rice is expensive on sunny days, rice is expensive on rainy days, rice is expensive without rice, rice is expensive with rice! There is rice in the warehouses, there is rice in the restaurants, why not seize the rice?!"

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: According to the Central News Agency, the floods in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, caused by Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt rule and neglected water conservancy, are becoming increasingly serious. The extent of the disaster and the intensity of the floods are unprecedented in a century. Following reports of flooding in southwestern Guangxi, there are now reports from Longshan, Guixian, Pingnan, and Du'an counties, bringing the total number of affected counties to 55. Starving people fill the roads in northern Guangxi, a truly heartbreaking sight. More than 40 counties in Guangdong Province have been affected by the disaster, nearly half of the province. The situation is most severe in the Xijiang River area. Nanhai, Sanshui, Gaoming, Gao'an, Deqing, and Fengchuan counties are completely flooded, with people, livestock, and houses swept away by the water. Many victims are living in the open on high ground.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: The Tianjin Yi Shi Pao, a Catholic newspaper with pro-Kuomintang leanings, published an article on the 16th of last month titled "Eventually, a Mound of Earth (referring to a grave)" stating: "The nationwide (Chiang-controlled area) surge in grain prices extends west to Chengdu, east to Suzhou and Hangzhou (actually reaching 경호), north to 榆关 (actually reaching the Northeast), and south to Hong Kong and Guangzhou; 평진 are the most unbearable." The article continued, stating that the famine is "caused by the (Chiang) government itself." The entire financial and economic crisis has become terminal. "Now, even summoning Bian Que and Hua Tuo cannot reverse the impending collapse."

　　蒋党狂征军粮造成严重粮荒
    蒋区人民普遍饥饿
    全家自杀卖儿鬻女时有所闻
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合上月份平津报纸消息：由于蒋政府狂征军粮，华北及东北蒋占区已整个淹没于粮荒中。上月天津面粉每袋最高涨达四十一万五千，较之一月初旬之四万，上升十倍。同时期北平稻米每斤五千一百，面粉每袋二十三万，均倍于一月市价。粮荒遍及中小城市及广大农村。静海、唐官屯（按：该地已于本月份解放）等地粮食绝迹，天津附近之独流镇上月三日赶集，小麦每升更突破五千二百。不仅广大市民、学生、教授陷于饥饿，即蒋家公务员军警等亦无法维生，上月二十四日北平有军警各一人因而自缢身死。青岛及开封粮价飞涨，致山东大学及河南大学全体教授学生及中小学教师等相继掀起反饥饿斗争。青岛警察李贵清夫妇竟将不满五月之幼子出卖换米。太原粮价更高于平津，五月中旬小麦即涨到四千二一升，至五月二十五日稻米竟卖到八十万一石，小米亦涨到四十六万一石。蒋政府为缓和粮荒，决定每月由东北运粮两万吨卖给平津。但据天津大公报载，东北蒋占区粮荒也很严重，安东省岫岩（后已解放）在蒋占时期全县三十万人竟有十三万人在饥饿中，饿殍日有数十，全家服毒及卖儿鬻女者时有所闻。沈阳高粱米二月初每斤值流通券（对“法币”为十三比一）二十元（合“法币”二百六十元）左右，五月中旬已涨到一百二十元以上。大公报说：被视为“米仓”的东北（指蒋占区部分）现已“空空如也”。蒋政府又拟由傅作义统治之察、绥两省运粮赴平津，但绥粮荒亦不亚于平津，归绥于四月二十三日至五月三日面粉由每斤六百涨到一千五百，十天中上升一倍半，绥西各县尤为严重，产粮较多之临河县已请求拨粮救济，晏江县有钱亦买不到粮，察省蒋占区情形亦同。
    【新华社华中二十四日电】综合沪报消息：素称“谷仓”之江西，因蒋政府搜刮军粮结果，粮荒极度严重。赣西永新县，过去常有余粮输出，今已哀鸿遍野。该县礼田镇居民陈细朵夫妇因不堪饥饿，双双悬梁自尽；和义乡胡先廷因粮价高涨，借贷无门，全家六口同时服毒自杀；沙市乡陈荀夫妇因儿女啼饥不已，煮食砒霜满门惨死。即昔日小康之家，今亦日以两餐稀粥，苟延残命。安福县及西江一带农民普遍以树皮野草为食。鄱阳湖东岸各县，往年余粮足供十余县之需，现亦陷于饥饿状态。
    【又讯】福州米价，近来每石涨达五十万元以上，市区小桥墙壁上有一标语谓：“晴天米贵，雨天米贵，无米也贵，有米也贵！仓库里有米，饭馆里有米，为什么不去抢米？！”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据中央社透露：由于蒋介石的腐败统治、水利失修而引起的桂粤两省水灾日趋严重，灾区之广，水势之烈，为百年来所仅见。桂西南继报水灾者，又有隆山、贵县、平南、都安等县，连前被灾者已达五十五县之多。桂北饥民载道，惨不忍睹。粤全省受灾县份在四十县以上，将达全省之半数。灾情以西江最重，南海、三水、高明、高安、德广、封川等县一片汪洋，人畜房屋尽付东流，灾民多露宿高地。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】天主教所办亲国民党的天津《益世报》，上月十六日发表题为《终须一个土馒头（按：指坟墓）》之论文称：“全国（蒋区）粮食涨风，西至成都，东达苏杭（实达京沪），北及榆关（实及东北），南穷港粤；而尤以平津为最不堪。”继称：粮荒实由“（蒋）政府本身所致。”且整个财政经济危机已病入膏盲，“现在请到扁鹊、华陀也不能挽狂澜于既倒。”
