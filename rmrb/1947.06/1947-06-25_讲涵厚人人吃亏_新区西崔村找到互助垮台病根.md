New and Old Areas Rectify Mutual Aid, Launching a Weeding Upsurge

　　Emphasizing Generosity Leads to Universal Losses
　　Xicui Village in the New District Finds the Root Cause of Mutual Aid's Collapse
　　[Report from our newspaper in Shahe] The peasants in Xicui Village, a newly liberated area, have begun to recognize the value of equivalent exchange through the organization of mutual aid. Out of the village's 185 households, 141 participated in mutual aid, accounting for 76 percent of the village's households. The 22 groups formed played a significant role in various agricultural activities such as spring plowing, sowing, drought prevention, and emergency wheat harvesting. However, there was a misunderstanding of mutual aid. At the review meeting, group leader Li Tianhe proudly said, "Our group is the 'Harmony Achieves Success' group, and there are no problems. The general public believes that after gaining land through the overthrow of the landlords, we should respond to Chairman Mao's call and repay Chairman Mao's kindness!" Guo Shunxing said, "I didn't contribute to the struggle against the landlords. Who knew I would be given a share of the fruits? Now I want to organize a mutual aid group to repay Chairman Mao's kindness." Others said, "Selfishness was the old society; the new society promotes selfless devotion." This was especially evident among the middle peasants, who were even more afraid of being selfish. They would lend their farm tools whenever asked, and in the labor evaluation, they all said, "It's nothing, a difference of three or four points doesn't matter." After the wheat harvest, the problems were exposed. Those with strong labor and farm tools felt they had suffered losses, and many conflicts arose in the mutual aid groups. Some wanted to withdraw, and some groups were on the verge of collapse. For example, Duan Fuxing's group had problems because the waterwheel wasn't properly valued. Guo Zigui would rather leave the waterwheel idle than let others use it. There was no mutual aid on the first day of the emergency wheat harvest. Li Tong's group also had problems because the wages set for the mule were unfair: ten jin of rice for the mule and five jin of rice for a person (but the mule irrigated one and a half mu of land per day, while a person took three days to irrigate one and a half mu). Everyone scrambled to use the mule, which made Li Wencheng's mule so tired it couldn't eat grass. In short, due to unfair labor evaluations and farm tools not being properly valued, people were generally unwilling to buy more farm tools, saying, "Without it, I'll just borrow from others; anyway, we shouldn't be selfish." This phenomenon has become the biggest obstacle to production movements and the development of mutual aid. Secondly, the failure to take equivalent exchange seriously has created a phenomenon of "strong men matched with strong men, heroes matched with heroes." Of the village's 22 groups, one group consisted entirely of women (with one male laborer), one group consisted entirely of children, and two groups consisted entirely of old men over 40. Ten groups had very few semi- or auxiliary laborers; almost all were full laborers. This phenomenon has caused many difficulties in production. For example, the children's group couldn't plow fallow land at all, and Li Hede's group had to use full laborers to change the ridges for irrigation. Now that the village has discovered these problems, the leadership is helping the masses understand the benefits of equivalent exchange and is carrying out rectification.

　　讲涵厚人人吃亏
    新区西崔村找到互助垮台病根
    【本报沙河讯】新区西崔村翻身农民从组织互助中开始认识等价好处。该村共一百八十五户，参加互助的一百四十一户，组织起来占全村户百分之七十六，共二十二个小组在春耕下种防旱备荒及突击麦收等各种农事活动中，起了不小的作用。但对互助的认识上，却有错误的了解，在检讨会上组长李天和很骄傲的说：“俺是和义成组，没有问题，一般群众认为翻身得地之后，应响应毛主席号召，报毛主席的恩！”郭顺兴说：“翻身斗争我没出力，谁知道这样给我分果实，现在我要组织一个互助组，报报毛主席的恩。”还有的说：“自私自利是旧社会，新社会兴的是大公无私。”表现特别明显的是中农，更不敢自私，农具要借就借，在劳力评议上都说：“没有啥，差个三分四分没什么关系。”麦收完毕后，问题就暴露出来了，劳力强的和有农具的觉得吃了亏，互助中产生不少矛盾，有的想退出，有的组陷半垮台状态，如段福兴组因为水车没顶分，郭子贵宁把水车闲着不愿叫别人用，在突击麦收的头一天就没有互助；李桐组因骡子定的工资不公平，也发生了问题，骡子工资十斤米，人五斤米，但（骡子浇地一天浇一亩半，人三天才浇一亩半，）大家争着用骡子，把李文成的骡子使的不吃草了，总之，因劳力评议不公及农具不顶分，普遍不愿再买农具，“没有了借人家的，反正是不兴自私。”这种现象成为生产运动及发展互助之最大障碍。其次由于等价不认真造成一种：“好汉对好汉，英雄对英雄”的现象，全村二十二个组有一个组全是妇女（一个男劳力），一个组全是儿童，还有二个组全是四十岁以上的老头。有十个组半、辅劳力很少，几乎全是全劳力。这种现象造成了生产中的不少困难，如儿童组犁垡地根本就不能干，而李盒德组浇地改畦也得全劳力。现该村于发现这些问题后，领导上正帮助群众认识等价好处，进行整顿。（兆秋、李克、高谦）
