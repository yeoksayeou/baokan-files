Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Nanjing Correspondence: On May 15th, more than 4,000 students from Nanjing Central University, Conservatory of Music, Drama School, and other schools held an anti-hunger parade. They held various flags with inscriptions such as "We want food" and "We are too hungry to attend classes." One flag depicted an empty rice bowl with a large character for "Hunger."

At 9:30 AM, the procession arrived at the entrance of the Ministry of Education, which was heavily guarded with police cars full of armed police and military police. The windows and doors of the Ministry of Education were tightly closed, and the staff had already left. The students shouted, "Zhu Jiahua, come out! Stop putting on airs!" There was no response from inside; the students surged forward. At 10:30 AM, Zhu Jiahua hurriedly returned from outside and was immediately surrounded by students. He tried to appear calm and ran to the balcony to "give a speech," but when he mentioned "how hard ordinary people work," the students shouted, "Why are you fighting a civil war?" "Stop talking nonsense!" The slogan "Behind the red doors, meat and wine rot" immediately appeared on the nearby stone pillars.

At 12:10 PM, when the procession reached the Executive Yuan, Wang Yunwu appeared before the students. The students unanimously demanded an increase in subsidies for non-staple foods and education funding. Wang stated, "There is no money, the budget is insufficient." The students questioned loudly, "Why is there no money?" Wang said in embarrassment, "I have no right to answer," "I would rather have my head cut off than be able to answer."

While student representatives went upstairs to continue negotiations, students from the propaganda group immediately launched propaganda work inside the Executive Yuan. The gold-lettered plaque of the "Executive Yuan" was covered with the four large characters "Officials are fat, the people are thin." A fat official and a skinny student were drawn on the screen, with the inscription "The belly is too big, what's inside—the people's fat and blood." The horizontal inscription read "Oppose Starvation Education." There was a chalk poem under the window of the reception room: "Gold and wine are the blood of the people, delicacies on jade plates are the fat of the people, when candle tears fall, the people's tears fall, where laughter is high, crying is high." Drama students performed living newspapers such as "Civil War Heroes" and "Social Celebrities" in the courtyard. The student performing "Civil War Hero" wore American khaki, dark glasses, and his hands behind his back, swaggering, while everyone pointed and scolded, chanting in unison: "You! You! You! You bad thing! There are not enough daily necessities on the market, you move them to the battlefield in large quantities. You group of bad things, you really deserve to be shot!..." When performing Mr. Wang from "Social Celebrities," the students unanimously booed Wang Yunwu.

At 5:00 PM, the negotiations were fruitless, and the students marched back to school in formation. They shouted all the way, "We will save our last breath, our last word, to be used in the future!"

　　反饥饿反内战的行列
    在蒋政府心脏内猛冲
    【新华社陕北四日电】南京通讯：五月十五日南京中央大学、音乐院、剧专等校学生四千余人，举行反饥饿大游行。他们手执各种旗子，上书“我们要吃饭”、“我们饿的不能上课”，有一面旗子上画着一只空饭碗，写着一个大大的“饿”字。
    九时三十分行列抵教育部门口，那里早已戒备森严，警车上满载武装警士和宪兵。教育部的窗门紧闭，职员们都已走了。学生们高呼：“朱家骅快出来！不要摆架子！”里面毫无声息；学生们一踊而进。十时三十分朱家骅匆匆自外面回来，立刻被学生包围了。他强作镇静的跑到楼台上“训话”，但当讲到“一般老百姓多么辛苦”一句时，学生们高呼：“为什么要打内战？”“不要说废话！”旁边石柱上立刻出现了“朱门酒肉臭”的标语。
    十二时十分游行至行政院，王云五出现在学生面前时，学生一致要求增加副食费及教育经费，王表示：“没有钱，预算不够”，学生们高声质问：“为什么没有钱？”王狼狈地说：“无权答复”，“头可断也无力答复”。
    当学生代表上楼继续谈判时，宣传组的同学马上在行政院内展开了宣传工作。“行政院”金字匾也被“民瘦官肥”四个大字盖没了。屏风上画了一个胖胖的官员和一个干瘦的学生，并写着“肚子太大，中间装的是什么——民脂民膏”。横批“反对饥饿教育”。会客室窗下有粉笔诗一首：“黄金美酒万民血，玉盘佳肴百姓膏，烛泪落时民泪落，欢声高处哭声高。”剧专学生在院内演出《内战英雄》、《社会贤达》等活报，表演《内战英雄》的同学身穿美国卡叽，戴黑眼镜，双手放在背后，大摇大摆，全体即指着高骂齐唱：“你！你！你！你这个坏东西！市面上日常用品不够用，你一大批一大批搬上战场去。你这批坏东西，你真正该枪毙！……”表演《社会贤达》的王先生时，同学们一致对王云五发出嘘声。
    五时谈判无结果，同学们整队回校。一路高呼：“我们要留最后一口气，最后一句话，待将来发挥！”
