Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—The heavy taxes and levies in the KMT-controlled areas have exceeded any previous era. According to incomplete statistics from Shanghai newspapers alone, there are as many as 84 types. These include Trade Profits Tax, Comprehensive Income Tax, Special Profits Tax, Excess Profits Tax, New Income Tax, Cigarette Tax, Tobacco and Alcohol Tax, Deposit Interest Income Tax, Shop Assistant Salary Tax, Business Tax, Business License Tax, Usage License Tax, Market Business Tax, Street Vendor Business Tax, Goods Tax, Public Market Tax, Foil Tax, Sea Tax, Customs Duty, Import Tax, Export Tax, Transit Tax, Freight Registration Tax, Slaughter Tax, New Slaughter Tax, Mineral Tax, Saltpeter Tax, Stamp Tax, Land Vendor Tax, Land Tax, Land Appreciation Tax, Deed Tax, Inheritance Tax, Transaction Tax, Field Tax (Cash), Requisition, Military Grain, Entertainment Donation, Feast Tax, House Donation, Public Utility Surcharge, Municipal Construction Donation, Sanitation Donation, Property Donation, Warehouse Donation, Land Donation, Baojia Donation, Winter Defense Donation, Cold Weather Clothing Donation, Autonomous Region Expenses, Shopping Donation, Strong Labor Fee, School Construction Fee, Porterage Fee, Epidemic Prevention Fee, Victory Fee,慰劳费, Transfer of Military Expenses, Investigation of Household Registration Personnel's Wine and Feast Expenses, Sanitation Fee, Handling Fee, Protection Fee, Public Security Fee, Security Fee, Public Welfare Fee, Administrative Fee, Seal Fee, Crossing Fee, Aviation Fee, Garrison Straw Fee, Repair of Township Office Fee, Central School Fee, Oil Brightening Fee, Quilt Fee, Shoe Fee, Inspection Fee, Office Fee, Clothing Fee, County Magistrate and Committee Members Visiting Township Hospitality Fee, Head and Deputy Bao Chiefs Training Fee, Defense and Clothing Fee, Teacher Respect Money, National Labor Service Substitute Money, etc.

(Editor's note: The taxes and levies in the KMT-controlled areas are by no means limited to these. KMT officials can come up with any excuse to extort money at any time. KMT troops in various places can directly plunder the people's property without any pretense; intercepting merchants and travelers' goods and money on the road is no different from bandits. Unlimited and rapid inflation is equivalent to levying incalculable heavy taxes on every person in the KMT area.)

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 14th—In the newly liberated Fencheng, the "soldier-peasant integration" policy of Yan Xishan's warlordism has caused 60% of the county's population to suffer from hunger. According to Guo Jinghua, former head of the Finance Section of the Yan Xishan Fencheng County Government, and Chen Jinghuan, head of the Land and Grain Department, last year (1946), the county's more than 500,000 mu of land was levied "military grain" once, amounting to more than 51,000 shi. The county government's annual expenditure was 20,000 shi. In addition to the 2 shi of regular grain "levied one, borrowed one" per tael of grain silver, the county government added more than 30 kinds of surcharges, such as "Central Government Purchased Grain," conscription grain, "National Army preferential treatment," and disaster relief grain, etc., with a total of more than 15 shi of grain levied per tael of grain silver, not including village expenses. The excessive number of miscellaneous taxes was astonishing, and even opera performances and banquets required taxes. Coupled with the demand for cloth, money, and the corruption and self-enrichment of district and village officials, the people of the entire county were generally plunged into poverty and hunger. Especially in the poor second and third districts, such as Shanglu, Dongniu, Yonggu and dozens of other villages, the people mostly lived on grass seeds and vegetable leaves, and suicides occurred frequently. Last summer, a hired worker in Zhaobu Village in the third district starved to death. Chen's father in Chengguanzhuang had 20 mu of wheat "combined" by the Yan army, and worried about his family's livelihood, he committed suicide by jumping into a well.

　　四大家族发内战财横征暴敛逼死人民
    【新华社陕北十三日电】蒋管区捐税摊派苛重已超过以往任何时代，仅据上海报纸之不完全统计，已达八十四种之多。计有贸易利得税、综合所得税、特别利得税、过分利得税、新所得税、香烟税、烟酒税、存款利息所得税、店员薪给报酬所交税、营业税、营业牌照税、使用牌照税、商场营业税、马路摊贩营业税、货物税、公共市场税、箔税、海税、关税、进口税、出口税、转口税、货运登记税、屠宰税、新屠宰税、矿产税、硝矿税、印花税、地贩税、土地税、土地增值税、契税、遗产税、交易税、田赋创实、征借、军粮、娱乐捐、筵席、房捐、公用事业附加捐、市政建设捐、卫生捐、房产捐、栈捐、地亩捐、保甲捐、冬防捐、寒衣捐、自治经费、购物捐、壮丁费、建校费、派夫费、防疫费、胜利费、慰劳费、挪动军费、调查户口人员酒筵费、卫生费、手续费、保护费、治安费、保安费、公益费、行政费、盖印费、过道费、航空费、驻军稻草费、培修乡公所费、中心校费、油亮费、被子费、鞋费、巡查费、办公费、服装费、县长及委员来乡招待费、正副保长受训费、保卫及服装费、尊师金、国家劳动服役代金等等。
    （编者按：蒋管区捐税摊派决不止这几种，蒋家官吏为了要钱随时都可以想出个名目来勒索。蒋军在各地，不用什么名目就可以直接劫掠人民的财产；在路上拦劫商旅的货物钱财更是和土匪一样。无限制的飞速的通货膨胀，则等于向蒋区每一个人民都征了无法计算的重税。）
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】新解放之汾城，在阎顽“兵农合一”的横征暴敛下，已使全县百分之六十人民陷于饥饿。据前阎顽汾城县府财政科长郭景华、田粮处长陈景桓称：去年（四六年）全县五十余万亩土地中，仅征收“军粮”一次即达五万一千余石。县府年支两万石。每两粮银除“征一借一”两石正粮外，另有县府附加“中央代购粮”、兵役粮、“国民兵优待”及救济粮等三十余种，每两粮银共征粮十五石以上，村费尚不在内，苛杂之多亦属惊人，连唱戏请客均需纳税。加以要布、要款、和区村人员的贪污自肥，逼使全县人民普遍陷于穷困饥饿。尤其贫瘠之二、三区新属上卢、东牛、永固等数十村，人民大都以草籽菜叶度日，自杀事件不断发生。去夏三区赵卜村一雇工活活饿毙，程官庄陈之父二十亩麦子被阎军“合”走，焦急全家生活而投井自杀。
