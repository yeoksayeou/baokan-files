　　Pingshun Beishe
    Replanting After Rain
    [This newspaper's Pingshun report] After the rain on the 25th of last month, Beishe seized the opportunity to immediately replant. Of the 557 mu of cotton planted in the village before the rain, 240 mu were missing seedlings. Of the 500 mu of Golden Queen, 210 mu had occasional missing seedlings. After the rain, the cadres organized 242 women and children from mutual aid teams to participate in the replanting. After three days of hard work, all 450 mu of missing seedlings have been replanted. In addition to a portion of the male labor force participating in plowing the mung bean fields, the rest fully participated in breaking up the clods. Because the grains planted before the rain all had clods, breaking up the clods was also completed within three days.
