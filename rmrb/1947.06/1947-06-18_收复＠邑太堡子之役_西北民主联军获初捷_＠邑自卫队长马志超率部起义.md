　　The Battle to Recover Taibaozi in @ County
    Initial Victory for the Northwest Democratic Allied Army
    Ma Zhichao, Self-Defense Captain of @ County, Leads Uprising
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th] Ma Zhichao, the battalion commander of the Chiang Kai-shek @ County Self-Defense Force, led his troops in an uprising during the Northwest People's Liberation Army's liberation of @ County (May 22nd), opposing the civil war. He reorganized the @ County Detachment in a certain location, with Ma Zhichao as the detachment leader. The Guanzhong Sub-district Command of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region held a banquet at its headquarters on the 27th of last month to celebrate the unit's formation and held a celebratory evening party. At the meeting, Director Zuo of the Guanzhong Sub-district Political Department spoke, encouraging all officers and soldiers of the detachment to study hard and serve the people loyally. Detachment Leader Ma then delivered a response, stating roughly: "Under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, we dared not speak our minds. The superiors didn't pay the Self-Defense Force for five months, but when it came to fighting, they always put us on the front lines as cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek. This kind of sacrifice is not worthwhile. From now on, we will stand with the People's Liberation Army and seek benefits for the people of @ County."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th] (Delayed News) The Sixth Cavalry Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army recovered Taibaozi, 30 li northwest of @ County, on June 3rd, annihilating over 200 members of the Self-Defense Force led by Bian Yi Shen, the Chiang Kai-shek fleeing county magistrate of @ County. They captured over 110 enemy personnel alive, including the enemy county magistrate Bian Yi Shen, and seized over 80 long and short guns and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition. The Sixth Cavalry Division suffered only 15 casualties. The Sixth Cavalry Division, which revolted in September of last year, has been deeply loved by the military and civilians of our border region. This time, in the liberation of Taibaozi, they took on the main attack, exchanging an extremely small number of casualties for eight or nine times the enemy's losses, achieving the first victory in the first joint operation of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army and the Northwest People's Liberation Army.

    ＠邑自卫队长马志超率部起义
    【新华社西北十六日电】蒋记＠邑自卫队大队长马志超，于西北人民解放军解放＠邑战斗中（五月二十二日）率部起义，反对内战，并于某地重新组织＠邑支队，由马志超任支队长。陕甘宁边区关中分区司令部，特于上月二十七日在驻地欢宴该队全体指战员、并举行庆祝晚会。会上关中分区政治部左主任讲话，勉励该队全体指战员，努力学习，忠诚地为人民服务。继由马支队长致答词，略谓：“在蒋胡统治下有话不敢说，上面五个月不给自卫队发饷，但是打仗时总是把我们放在最前线给蒋介石当炮灰，这种牺牲是不值得的，今后要和人民解放军站在一道，为＠邑人民谋利益。”
    【新华社西北十六日电】（迟到消息）西北民主联军骑六师，于六月三日收复＠邑西北三十里之太堡子，歼灭＠邑蒋记逃亡县长边翼沈所率之自卫队等二百余人，生俘敌县长边翼沈以下一百一十余人，缴获长短枪八十余支，子弹千余发，骑六师伤亡仅十五名。按骑六师于去年九月起义，深得我边区军民之爱戴，此次解放太堡子担任主攻，以极少数之伤亡，换得敌人八九倍之损失，获得西北民主联军与西北人民解放军首次并肩作战之初次胜利。
