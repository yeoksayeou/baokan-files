Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, Urgent Telegram, 8th: The Democratic Allied Army on the An(dong)-Shen(yang) Railway front recaptured the county seat of Kuandian at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 7th). The city is located more than 150 li northeast of Andong. The defending Chiang Kai-shek troops fled towards Andong and Fengcheng. The Democratic Allied Army is in pursuit.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 9th: In the battle to annihilate the 71st Army on the Gongzhuling-Huai'de Railway, the "Boshan" Company of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army completed a 30-li long-distance run in two hours, catching up with the enemy at Bajiazi. The deputy company commander shouted loudly to the enemy trapped in the courtyard: "The guns belong to Chiang Kai-shek, but your lives are your own!" After a burst of noise within the enemy ranks, one person was heard asking, "What about our personal belongings?" "As long as you lay down your weapons, your personal belongings will not be touched at all!" Before the voice finished, a "clatter" "clatter" was heard in the courtyard, and machine guns, submachine guns, and rifles were piled up in a large pile. The unarmed enemies were neatly lined up in the courtyard. After the soldiers of the company entered the courtyard, they pulled the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who had laid down their weapons and explained the preferential treatment policy to them kindly. One soldier, fearing that the prisoners were cold, took off his cotton coat and gave it to him. One Chiang Kai-shek soldier said very gratefully, "I still have a few grenades in my pocket, I'll give them to you too!" Another said, "There is a mortar hidden under the grass!" In this pursuit battle, the "Boshan" Company suffered only one minor injury and solved the battle with one grenade, creating a battle example with a ratio of one to one hundred and twenty-nine.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: The people of Northeast China have launched a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army, participating in the war, and comforting the troops. In Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Nenjiang and other provinces, tens of thousands of liberated young farmers have poured to the front lines within half a month. In Shuangcheng and Lalin counties alone, more than 2,000 people joined the army within ten days. Immediately after Yanji City joyfully sent more than 800 new soldiers to the front line, it organized two stretcher teams with more than 700 members in three days and set off to the front line. In Fangzheng County, Mingyang District and other places, the number of personnel participating in war support has exceeded the original plan by more than double. The villages and hamlets in Hulan County heard the good news and prepared four-horse carts, ready to depart at any time. The land of military dependents and civilian husbands' families is all cultivated by the people in the rear. Women in Shitou and Xunxi villages in Wangqing County have helped military dependents and civilian husbands' families hoe the first time. More than one million people in various large and small cities and towns have launched large-scale movements to comfort the troops. (Attached picture)
