Jiluyu Administrative Office Calls For Quick Harvest, Quick Threshing, Quick Storage

　　[Our Newspaper Jiluyu Dispatch, 31st] As the wheat harvest approaches, the Jiluyu Administrative Office has issued instructions on safeguarding the wheat harvest, calling on the military, government, and people of the entire region to fully protect the wheat harvest. The instructions stated in brief: To prevent Chiang Kai-shek's bandits from looting and plundering our area, the military, government, and people of the entire region should be urgently mobilized to lead the masses in protecting the wheat harvest. The specific methods are: (1) In areas with a working foundation, mutual aid teams should be widely organized at the village level to seize the time and achieve quick harvest, quick threshing, and quick storage. (2) In guerrilla areas and guerrilla base areas, local armed forces and militias should jointly defend against the enemy, protecting the masses during the wheat harvest. Launch mass struggles against grain robbery. (3) Accepting the experience of the anti-Japanese War and the ten months of patriotic self-defense war against aiding the enemy, launch a struggle against aiding the enemy: 1. Control backward and destructive elements to prevent them from aiding the enemy. 2. Oppose the enemy's high-priced purchases with Chiang Kai-shek currency, strengthen anti-smuggling work, and launch a mass anti-smuggling campaign to prevent the enemy from purchasing grain. 3. Troops and organs in the enemy's rear and border areas should seize the opportunity to help the masses with the wheat harvest when it does not affect combat. During the wheat harvest period, rear organs, schools, etc., should focus on organizing the masses for mutual aid in order to actively help the masses with the wheat harvest and improve relations between the military, government, and people. 4. During the wheat harvest period, strictly follow procedures for dispatching labor. Except for particularly urgent and important needs, rear organs are generally prohibited from dispatching labor in order to concentrate efforts on the wheat harvest.
    [Our Newspaper Jiluyu Dispatch, 31st] The Jiluyu Seventh Military Sub-district Headquarters Political Department instructed subordinate troops to protect the wheat harvest. The instructions stated in brief: As the wheat harvest approaches, the enemy will inevitably frantically rob grain. We must mobilize, actively strike at the grain-robbing enemy, protect the masses during the wheat harvest, and participate fully in the wheat harvest under possible conditions, organizing the masses to rush the harvest: (1) Before the wheat harvest, we should seize the time to summarize merits, commend models, and improve military and political struggle techniques in guerrilla warfare to prepare for protecting the wheat harvest. (2) Conduct ideological education on the wheat harvest among the troops, proposing individual and group-level competitions for wheat harvest meritorious service, seeing who harvests the fastest, bundles the best, and can transport it back to the threshing ground, without walking on wheat fields during marches and without dropping wheat heads during harvesting, etc. (3) In guerrilla areas and border areas, when the enemy comes out to rob grain, they should be beaten back, and the recovered grain should be returned to the masses. In the core areas, we should act together and participate in the wheat harvest as a whole. (4) Cooperate with the democratic government to organize the masses to rush the harvest, thresh quickly, and store quickly. Do more publicity work to mobilize and organize the masses to disperse and store grain. (5) Except for military actions during the wheat harvest, classwork should be suspended for five to seven days, with cadres taking the lead in participation in the wheat harvest. On average each member of the specially guarded guerrilla troops should harvest one mu. Troops in a guerrilla environment should harvest an average of two mu per person. Rear organs, schools, etc., should harvest an average of three mu per person. The labor heroes and model examples in the wheat harvest should be summarized and commended in a timely manner.
