　　Chiang Kai-shek's Party Disregards Farmers' Interests
    Imports Large Quantities of American Cotton
    Tianjin and Shanghai Prices Soar Again
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Tianjin newspapers: Chiang Kai-shek's party is facing a severe shortage of goods and is eager for American aid. The "quota" for imported foreign cotton this year is one million bales, equivalent to more than 510 million pounds, imported from the United States, Brazil, and other places. The price of foreign cotton plus freight is approximately 34 American cents per pound, totaling 170 million US dollars (equivalent to 200 trillion current Chiang Kai-shek currency). Based on past experience, the actual amount will greatly exceed this figure.
    Previous material controls in Tianjin failed. Now, military police and the Kuomintang will jointly implement controls, which began on May 20th, and have identified 14 types of controlled materials, an increase of four from before. However, there is still no effect, and prices continue to rise sharply. (Trade Headquarters)

　　蒋党不顾农民利益
    大批美棉入口
    天津上海物价又狂涨
    【本报讯】据天津报载：蒋党物价匮乏严重，渴求美方援助。本年外棉输进“限额”为百万包，合五十一万万余磅，分由美国、巴西等地输进，以国外市价加运费每磅约合美金三角四分，共一亿七千万元（折合当前蒋币两万万亿元）。按照过去经验，实际上必将大大超过此数。
    津市前物资管制失败，今改为军警宪会同管制，已于五月二十日开始办公，并确定管制物资十四种，较前增加四种。但仍无效果，物价仍猛烈上涨。（贸总）
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据美联社消息：上海二十四日美金黑市狂涨至四万一千元法币兑美金一元，次日（二十五日）更涨至四万五千元。米价二十四日涨至接近五十万元。近数周来，米价均在四十万元左右。又据天津益世报迟到消息：天津物价涨势汹涌，仅十一日一天之内，大米每斤从三千五飞涨至三千八，“五福”布由二十九万涨达三十二万元。其他粗细粮纱布煤油等亦均猛涨。
