　　Saving Labor and Expanding Production
    Tunliu's Luocun Village Collectivizes Cattle Herding
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 15th] Luocun Village in Tunliu has established a pasture, saving labor and increasing production. Under the leadership of cooperative hero Guo Yutang and labor hero Niu Yongqing, the village recently established four pastures, concentrating sixty-two head of cattle, large and small. The head of the Dahuaishu Village pasture is Liu Shengfang, an experienced old man in livestock management, who is assisted by a fourteen-year-old herdboy. In addition to accepting cattle from mutual aid groups, they also take in cattle from nearby villages. The methods are as follows: (1) The cattle herders are all considered full laborers in the mutual aid group, and they earn one work point per day, regardless of cloudy or rainy weather; (2) For cattle herded on behalf of other villages, large cattle earn one *dou* of wage grain per month, and small cattle earn five *sheng* per month. The grain earned, after deducting the wages of the cattle herders, is divided between the herders and the mutual aid group at a ratio of 20/80, with the herders receiving 20 and the mutual aid group receiving 80. The herders also receive a share of other dividends within the group; (3) Livestock are collectively managed in three pens at night, and fodder is allocated according to the size of the livestock. Currently, there is plenty of green grass, so there is no need to provide fodder. The cattle owners take turns providing meals for the herders, and manure is distributed according to the number of days they provide meals; (4) If cattle herded on behalf of others are taken back for use, wages will be deducted for those used more than three days, but not for those used three days or less; (5) Any income the herders earn from digging up medicinal herbs belongs to them. The other three pastures include one in Magou, with eleven head of cattle, one in Miaohougou with ten head of cattle, and one in Tunao with twenty head of cattle. In the past, each person herded an average of two cattle for seven months a year. Sixty-one cattle would require thirty-one people every day. Now, only six people are needed, which can save more than 5,000 work days per year. The county governments have recently allocated 500,000 yuan to support this effort.
