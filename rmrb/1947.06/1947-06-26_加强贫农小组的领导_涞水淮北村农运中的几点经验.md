　　Strengthen the Leadership of Poor Peasant Groups
    Several Experiences from the Agrarian Movement in Huaibei Village, Laishui
    Experience from the struggle of peasants to turn the tables in Huaibei Village, Laishui, proves that strengthening the leadership of poor peasant groups is an important link in the entire movement. The experiences of this village are now briefly introduced for reference in various regions:
    (1) From the "United Hearts Society" to the "Solidarity Society," a struggle between two different lines existed from the beginning of the struggle. This struggle is manifested in the different demands of middle peasants and poor peasants, and becomes even more obvious when the struggle comes to a stage. For example, middle peasants reflected, "Everything has been struggled out, let's hurry up and divide it!" Some said, "How can we struggle against those who are landlords and family members of those fighting the Japanese? If we offend people, we may not be able to divide anything!" At the beginning, the leadership followed the line of a few cadres, accepting the wavering and incomplete thinking of the middle peasants. In the general meeting, a few cadres shouted, and the people below echoed, and a resolution to release the landlords without principle was "passed," giving the landlords a chance to take advantage of the situation to sabotage and hide materials, causing the struggle to stagnate. The demand of the poor peasants was "Fight to the end, leave no tails." "We are struggling against the landlords, we can't just say they are family members of those fighting the Japanese." "Oppose compromise as running dogs, oppose taking care of the landlords first, regardless of whether the poor have rice to eat." Of the above two, the former is a rich peasant line, characterized by satisfaction with the status quo, low vigilance, emphasis on taking care, wavering stance, emotionalism, and incomplete struggle. The latter is the peasants' desire to unite and struggle, to turn things upside down, to break through the bad sentiments, to have a firm stance, and to oppose being running dogs. In the struggle between these two lines, the poor peasants of this village first united under the leadership of poor and active elements, organized poor peasant groups, first held a "United Hearts Society," and then held a "Solidarity Society" with the middle peasants. At the United Hearts Society of the poor peasant groups, they felt that they were all of one mind, and there were no scruples in speaking. They first conducted ideological self-criticism, educated themselves, and discussed "Is this struggle thorough? How can we be considered to have completely turned the tables? Have we all expressed our sufferings?" "What destructive actions have the landlords taken after being released? Who is acting as a running dog for the landlords? Which cadres cannot represent our interests?" "Who should we unite with? Who should we fight against? What should we do in the future?" After a heated exchange of opinions, it was finally decided to continue to detain the landlords, hold a bitterness-airing meeting, expose the landlords' running dogs, elect a new chairman, and hold a solidarity meeting with the middle peasants to jointly deal with the landlords, and specifically handle different landlords differently. The main landlords were detained day and night. The secondary landlords were taken to work and reform on the poor peasants' land by the labor allocation team during the day, and detained at night. Small and medium landlords who had surrendered to the peasants were gradually released. Children of the landlords who had not directly exploited others were not detained. After the landlords were detained, a peasant solidarity meeting was held that evening. Due to the backbone role and organized strength of the poor peasant groups, the above opinions of the poor peasants were quickly passed by the meeting. The order was that the poor peasants first reviewed the previous struggle, inspiring the ideological reflection of all the peasants. In the speeches of more than twenty middle peasants, they all confessed their wavering thoughts, such as saying: "I am mainly afraid of retaliation, they have people in both the civil and military fields, I just had a bowl of porridge to drink, and I forgot the bitterness." Most of the middle peasants who spoke said: "The poor peasants struggle thoroughly and are more active than our middle peasants, we must learn from them." Someone at the meeting automatically shouted slogans: "Peasants unite and completely overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!" "Follow the poor peasants, turn the tables, everyone turns the tables!" The leading position of the poor peasants was thus laid the foundation. It also proves that the middle peasants and poor peasants are basically united in the demand to eliminate feudal exploitation and turn the tables together. Although there are different demands at the beginning, the middle peasants will accept the correct opinions of the poor peasants after repeated explanations. "First satisfying the demands of the landless and land-poor peasants" will become a principle voluntarily accepted by all middle and poor peasants.
    (2) Strengthening the leadership of poor peasant groups must be combined with the leadership of the village branch and the leadership of the village cadres. Because in the land reform, "first satisfying the demands of the poor peasants" is a principle that cannot be moved in the slightest. This requires strengthening the leadership of the poor peasant groups. Without their concentrated opinions and their concentrated organization, the goal of completely turning the tables for the poor peasants cannot be achieved. However, if the village cadres are abandoned, and the vast number of party members (generally mostly middle peasants or newly rising middle peasants) are abandoned, to simply lead the poor peasants or the newly rising middle peasants, it will isolate the poor peasants and cause obstruction and sabotage by individual cadres and wavering party members. It should be recognized that today, except for those of landlord origin or with political problems, the cadres or party members who resist the demands of the poor peasants are in the minority. If, while leading the poor peasant groups, at the same time calling on party members with good conditions to support the demands of the poor peasants, calling on all cadres to be bold and dare to withstand the test and transformation of the poor peasants, and if this ideological education is grasped tightly and carried out in a complementary manner, the above phenomena can be avoided. Party member cadres who cannot firmly stand on the side of the poor peasants have nothing to say even if they are pushed off the stage by the peasants. For example, the village peasant association director (lower-middle peasant) in this village made the mistake of drinking and colluding with the landlords. After being dismissed, he admitted his mistake to the masses and continued to work actively, which is an example. Experience in the struggle proves that when the leading advantage of the poor peasants is not yet consolidated, grasping the ideological education of party members and cadres and supporting the leading position of the poor peasants is extremely important. It is very necessary to repeatedly carry out the education of the mass line and the education of firm class stand among party members and cadres.
    (3) Poor peasant groups should be organized through the mass line, and the organizational form should be chosen by the peasants themselves. The poor peasant groups were initially developed from point to surface by active elements uniting with poor peasants. Although some middle peasants were mixed in at this time, such "expanded alliances" with poor peasants as the core were conducive to the struggle. For example, the Huaibei poor peasant group had three groups with only ten people in each group, and later had more than twenty people in each group, making the peasants more united and stronger. However, after the organization expanded, the class was not clarified in time, and the composition within the poor peasant group was impure, so it was difficult for the leadership to listen to and concentrate the opinions of the poor peasants in a timely manner. At the same time, there were also rightist deviations in discussing issues. For example, most of the middle peasants who came in after the transition to distribution proposed to leave a living for the landlords first (the motive was to deal with the landlord problem and end the struggle as soon as possible). Some proposed to leave five dou of grain for each landlord, and said: What if the landlord has no livestock? The poor peasants immediately proposed: "In this way, their lives are still higher than ours, what if we still have nothing to cook now?" The different demands of the middle peasants and poor peasants became more and more clear. After the leadership understood these situations, they immediately seized this demand and immediately led the masses to evaluate the class themselves, first through self-evaluation by the group, members reported their family situation, everyone discussed, then through mutual evaluation by the group, and then through the method of general meeting. It was not only carried out quickly, but also very thoroughly. After the meeting, the peasants reflected: "Clarifying the class, everyone can turn the tables." "The class is evaluated by all the villagers, how much should be divided, don't blame anyone, and don't pretend to be a poor peasant anymore!" In this way, the separate organization and discussion of issues by the poor peasant groups were considered reasonable by all the peasants (previously, because some middle peasants were mixed in, the middle peasants who were not mixed in were not satisfied), and the specific realization of first satisfying the demands of the poor peasants in the distribution was also guaranteed. There are the following two organizational methods for poor peasant groups, which can be discussed and selected by the peasants themselves: (1) The poor peasant groups have a fixed organizational form, and all the peasants are organized into one large group or several small groups. The advantage of this organizational form is that it can timely concentrate the opinions of the poor peasant class, and the requirements are consistent and the discussion is convenient. (2) The poor peasant groups do not have a fixed organizational form, and are mixed with the middle peasants into peasant association groups, but the poor peasants maintain separate poor peasant meetings to discuss various issues. The advantage of this form is that it can not only concentrate the poor peasant line, but also play a backbone role in each group, adhere to the poor peasant line. At the same time, it is better in form for the unity of the middle peasants. However, no matter which form is adopted, the poor peasants must occupy a dominant position in the leading organs of the peasant association in order to enable them to play a backbone role and ensure that the poor peasant line can be implemented.

　　加强贫农小组的领导
    涞水淮北村农运中的几点经验
    涞水淮北村农民翻身斗争中的经验证明，加强贫农小组的领导，是整个运动中的重要环节，现在把该村的经验简要介绍，以供各地参考：
    （一）由“齐心会”到“团结会”，从斗争开始就存在两条不同路线的斗争，这一斗争表现在中农与贫农的不同要求上，特别当斗争告一段落时，则更加明显。如中农反映“东西都斗出来啦，赶快分喽算咧！”有的说：“他们是地主又是抗干属怎么斗呢？得罪了人，不一定能分得东西！”开始时领导上走了少数干部路线，接受了中农这种动摇的不彻底的思想，在大会上少数干部一呼喊，下面一应声，就“通过”了无原则释放地主的决议，使地主得到乘机破坏和掩藏物资的机会，使斗争陷入停顿状态。而贫农的要求是“斗要斗到底，不留尾巴”。“咱斗的是地主，不能光说他是抗干属”。“反对妥协当走狗，反对先照顾地主，不管穷人没米吃。”以上两种，前者是富农路线，其特点是满足现状，警惕性低，强调照顾，立场动摇，感情用事，斗不彻底。后者是农民要团结斗争，要翻心，打破臭情面，立场要坚定，反对当走狗。在这两条路线的斗争中，该村贫农首先在贫苦积极分子的带头之下，团结起来，组织贫农小组，先开“齐心会”，然后再同中农一齐开“团结会”，在贫农小组的齐心会上，他们觉得都是齐心的人，发言无顾虑，他们先进行思想检讨，教育了自己，讨论了“这次斗争彻底不彻底？咱们怎样才算是彻底翻身？咱们的苦是否都诉说了？”“放了地主，他们有什么破坏行动？谁给地主当走狗来？那些干部不能代表咱们的利益？”“应当团结谁？斗谁？以后怎么办？”经热烈发表意见，最后决定继续扣押地主，开诉苦大会，检举地主走狗另选新主席，和中农开团结会，共同对付地主，并具体分别不同地主不同处置。对主要地主昼夜扣押。次要地主白天由拨工组带到贫农地的劳动感化，晚上扣押。已向农民屈服的中小地主逐渐释放。地主家的没直接剥削过人的子女不扣押。把地主扣起来以后，当晚召开农民团结大会。由于贫农小组的骨干作用和有组织的力量，贫农的上述意见，很快得到大会的通过。次序是先由贫农对上次斗争进行检讨，启发起农民大家的思想反省，二十多个中农发言中，都坦白了自己的动摇思想，如说：“我主要是怕人家报复，人家文方面武方面都有人，我刚有碗粥喝了，就忘了苦”。多数发言的中农都表示：“贫农斗争彻底，比咱们中农积极要向他们看齐。”会上有人自动喊出口号：“农民团结起来，彻底打倒小蒋介石！”“跟着贫农走，翻身，大家都翻身！”贫农的领导地位，于此奠定基础。也由此证明，中农与贫农在消灭封建剥削大家一齐翻身的继要求下，基本上是团结一致的，开始虽有不同要求，但反复说明解释之下，中农会接受贫农的正确意见。“首先满足无地少地贫农的要求，”会成为所有中贫农自愿接受的原则。
    （二）加强贫农小组的领导，必须与对村支部的领导和村干部的领导相结合。因为土地改革中，“首先满足贫苦农民要求”是一条不能丝毫移动的原则，这就必须要加强贫农小组的领导，没有他们集中的意见和他们集中的组织，便不能达到使贫农彻底翻身的目的。但如果抛开村干部，抛开广大的党员群众（一般大部为中农或新上升的中农）去单纯的领导贫农或新上升中农，会使贫农孤立而且会引起个别干部及不坚定的党员阻挠和破坏。应认识到今天除了那些地主成份或有政治问题的以外，反抗贫农要求的干部或党员是少数的，如果于领导贫农小组同时，在号召党员好条件的去支持贫农要求，号召所有干部要大胆的敢于去经受贫农的考验和改造，而且这个思想教育只要是抓的紧，又是相辅进行的话，以上现象是可以避免的。不能坚定的站在贫农立场的党员干部，即便被农民推下台来，也无话可说。如该村农会主任（下中农）犯了和地主喝酒拉拢的错误，被罢免后，向群众承认错误，仍积极工作，就是一个例子。在斗争中的经验证明，当贫农领导优势尚不巩固时，抓紧党员干部的思想教育，支持贫农的领导地位是极其重要的。在党员干部中，反复进行群众路线的教育，坚定阶级立场的教育，十分必要。
    （三）贫农小组要经过群众路线组织起来，由农民自己选择组织形式。贫农小组起初是由于积极分子联合贫农由点到面发展起来的，此时虽有中农混入，但这样由贫农为核心的“扩大联合”却有利于斗争。如淮北贫农小组，以前三组，每组只十人，后来每组二十多人，使农民更加团结，力量更加雄厚。但组织扩大以后，未及时查清阶级，贫农小组内成分不纯，因而领导上及时倾听和集中贫农的意见感到困难，同时在讨论问题时，还发生了右的偏向，如转入分配以后混进来的大部中农，又提出先给地主留生活（其动机是赶快处理地主问题结束斗争），有的提给地主一人留五斗粮，还说：地主没有牲口怎么办？贫农马上提出：“这样他们仍比我们生活高，我们现在还没的下锅怎么办”？中农贫农的不同要求，越来越加明白。领导上了解了这些情况以后，即抓紧这一要求，立即领导群众自己动手评定阶级，先经小组自评，组员报告家庭状况，大家讨论，再经小组互评，大会通过的方法，不但进行得很快，而且非常彻底。会后农民反映：“弄清阶级，大家才能都翻身。”“阶级是全村人评的，该分多少分多少，没的怨谁，也别再冒充贫农了！”这样，贫农小组的单独组织与讨论问题，全体农民都认为合理了（以前因有中农混入，故未混入的中农就不满意），分配中先满足贫农要求的具体实现也有了保障。贫农小组的组织办法有以下两种，可由农民自己讨论选择：（一）贫农小组有固定的组织形式，把全体农民编为一个大组或几个小组。这种组织形式的好处，一是可以及时集中贫农阶层的意见，二是要求一致，讨论方便。（二）贫农小组没有固定的组织形式的与中农混编为农会小组，但贫农保持单独的贫农会议，进行各项问题的讨论，这种形式的好处是不仅能集中贫农路线，而且能在各小组中起骨干作用，坚持贫农路线，同时，在对中农的团结上，形式上较好。但不论采取那种形式，贫农必须在农会领导机关中占有优势的地位，才能使其发挥骨干作用，使贫农路线得以贯彻。        （新华社）
