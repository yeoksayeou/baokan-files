The Common People's Eggs
    ——A Frontline Anecdote
    Xiao Cai
    During the battle of Tangyin, one of our units was stationed in the village of Beidian, north of Tangyin. Most of the villagers had been frightened away by the enemy's rumors. The soldiers gathered up the villagers' scattered belongings and put seals on the cabinets. When the communications squad was about to leave, they placed the eight eggs laid by the villagers' hens in a jar, and left a note saying: "We are not like the Central Army. Your hens laid eggs, and we have collected them for you. Please check."

    打汤阴时，我们一个部队驻在汤阴的北店村，老乡们大部被敌人的谣言吓唬跑了，战士们把老乡散乱的东西收拾起，并在柜子上写上封条。通讯班战士在临走时把老乡鸡子下的八个蛋放在罐子里，并留了一个条子说：“咱们和中央军不一样，你的鸡子下了蛋，我们帮你收起来了请查收。”
