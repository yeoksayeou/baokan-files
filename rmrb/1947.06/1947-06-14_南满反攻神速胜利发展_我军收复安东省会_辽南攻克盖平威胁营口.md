　　Rapid and Victorious Development of the Counter-Offensive in Southern Manchuria
    Our Army Recovers the Provincial Capital of Andong
    Captures Gaiping in Southern Liaoning, Threatening Yingkou
    [New China News Agency, Liaodong, Urgent Telegram, 11th] The Democratic Allied Army on the Andong-Shenyang front completely recovered Andong City, the capital of Andong Province, in a five-hour fierce battle yesterday (the 10th). Over 200 enemies were killed or wounded, and over 600 enemies, including the commander of the 2nd Regiment, were captured. Eight mortars, over ten heavy machine guns, three trainloads of military supplies, and countless other materials were seized. Furthermore, the Democratic Allied Army, advancing north along the Andong-Shenyang line, occupied the two important stations of Lianshanguan and Xiamatang, more than 100 li south of Benxi, on the 10th. The defending enemy fled north upon hearing the news. Thus, the entire 360-plus li of the Andong-Shenyang line from Andong to Fengcheng, Lianshanguan, and Xiamatang is completely controlled by the Democratic Allied Army, connecting the Andong area with the southern Liaoning area. Note: Andong City was occupied by the Chiang army on October 24th of last year and has now been liberated again in less than eight months.
    [New China News Agency, Liaodong, Urgent Telegram, 11th] A unit of the Democratic Allied Army on the southern Liaoning front captured Gaiping County (approximately 60 li south of Yingkou) on the southern section of the Middle-East Railway at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 10th) with rapid action. The battle ended after two hours, and two companies of the reorganized 25th Division of the Chiang army and a portion of the security forces defending the city were annihilated; the remaining enemy fled in disarray.
    [New China News Agency, Liaodong, 12th] Preliminary statistics from the battle to recover Kuandian on the Andong-Shenyang front on the 7th: Over 500 Chiang bandit security forces from the 11th Detachment were captured alive, including one director of the political department and two battalion commanders from that detachment. Four light and heavy machine guns, four 60mm mortars, over 300 rifles, and over 60 carts were seized. (Picture Attached)
