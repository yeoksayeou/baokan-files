　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: According to TASS, Prague: The World Federation of Trade Unions Congress closed on the 14th. The congress unanimously passed a resolution on the issue of Africa, considering the African Trade Union Congress held in Dakar in April as the first important action of the WFTU in colonial countries. It is imperative to continue activities in the future to protect the freedom of all trade unions on the African continent. Regarding the resolution on Germany, the congress acknowledged the democratic development of German trade unions, which had approximately 6.8 million members by the end of 1946. The congress appealed to the German occupying authorities to abolish measures that would hinder the unification of German trade unions, and urged that trade union representatives be allowed to participate in all official and semi-official organizations, permitting trade unions to actively participate in the work of eliminating Nazis and in all political life in Germany. The resolution regarding the Secretary-General's report on the activities of the WFTU pointed out the extensive and effective work completed by the WFTU in the year and a half since its establishment, uniting 70 million workers in 65 countries. It also stated: Reactionary forces in many countries have taken the offensive, attempting to destroy the people's democratic movement. The WFTU must strengthen the struggle against fascism, regardless of the form it takes. Regarding the Secretary-General's report on the relationship between the WFTU and the United Nations, the resolution stated: This congress declares that certain governments still oppose granting the WFTU the opportunity to actively participate in the work of UN agencies. The congress takes this opportunity to protest the position taken by these governments, and reiterates its previous resolution, demanding that the WFTU be given a position in the United Nations and its agencies with full participation in the work of establishing lasting peace.
