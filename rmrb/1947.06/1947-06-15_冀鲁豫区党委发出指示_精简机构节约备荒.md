Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee Issues Instructions
Streamline Organizations, Conserve Resources, and Prepare for Famine
[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office, 13th] The Ji-Lu-Yu District Party Committee issued instructions on production, conservation, drought prevention, and famine preparation, calling on Party members, government officials, soldiers, and civilians to immediately rise up and fight the drought. The instructions pointed out: Since the start of the War of Self-Defense, the scale of manpower and material resources mobilized to support the front lines in our district, the severity of the damage inflicted on the people by Chiang's troops, and the extent of the area ravaged by Chiang's troops are all unprecedented. Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the Yellow River has temporarily turned half of Henan into a guerrilla zone, and a large amount of manpower in the counties along the river has been drawn into repairing the dikes. Coupled with the lack of significant rainfall since the beginning of spring, we are facing the threat of drought. To fully prepare financial and material resources for the counter-offensive, we must rise up and overcome the current unprecedentedly severe financial and economic difficulties. The instructions called on the entire Party, the entire army, and all the people to immediately take action and earnestly implement the following measures: (1) Organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in rural areas, overcome any mentality of waiting, and immediately carry out water carrying for planting, seedling transplantation, and weeding, preparing to seize the opportunity to replant promptly after rainfall. Leading organs at all levels, especially at the county, district, and village levels, must seize every opportunity amidst war support, re-examination, and dike repair to think of every possible way to ensure that agricultural timing is not missed, guaranteeing that not an inch of land is left uncultivated. All Party comrades must clearly recognize that production is an important guarantee for winning battles, and therefore, under the premise of subordinating everything to the war, we must overcome the contradiction between war and production and strive to develop production. (2) Party, government, military, and rear area organs and troops, in conjunction with land reform, war support, and dike repair work in the villages where they are stationed, must immediately help and organize the masses through personal involvement, taking the lead in completing the work of carrying water for planting, seedling transplantation, weeding, and replanting promptly after rainfall, and take full responsibility for any delays in agricultural timing or uncultivated land occurring in the villages where they are stationed. (3) Universally sound the alarm for drought prevention and famine preparation among the masses, helping them to formulate plans for drought prevention, famine preparation, production, and conservation, mobilizing them to store the wealth and grain distributed during the re-examination process to prepare for surviving the famine. Call on the masses to examine village expenditures, reduce village burdens, and urge all organs and troops to immediately implement a reduction of one to two ounces of grain consumption per person per day, saving all public and private expenses that can be saved. Each organ should manage and store the saved grain themselves for famine preparation. (4) Resolutely implement the policy of streamlining organizations, immediately abolishing or suspending all unnecessary and non-urgent organizations and undertakings, eliminating overlapping organs, and merging or jointly operating departments of the same nature. The army should implement a roll-call system to eliminate ghost soldiers and reduce non-essential personnel. Surplus local personnel should be transferred to combat troops, financial and economic departments, or land reform work. Rear area family members should be earnestly rectified to ensure they engage in production and self-sufficiency, reducing public expenses. In short, all manpower, financial resources, and material resources should be used with a focus on key priorities, resolutely opposing trying to revive everything at once, taking care of everything, and ending up accomplishing nothing. (5) In the merit-making campaign, all Party comrades should list the above points as specific content of their merit-making plans. All Party comrades must strive to overcome the current financial and economic difficulties and fight for a full-scale counter-offensive.
