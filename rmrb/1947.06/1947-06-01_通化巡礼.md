Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 29th: Our reporter, following personnel of the democratic government, entered the newly liberated city of Tonghua. The first thing that met the eye was the numerous pillboxes in the suburbs; there were more than two hundred of them on the mountains around Erdaojiang and Xianrendong alone. The hawthorn trees in nearby villages had not been stripped, and large tracts of land lay barren.

　　In the city center, representatives from all walks of life, carrying various colored flags, lined the streets to welcome the government, shouting, "Our government is back!" A shop owner told the reporter, "At first, we all hoped the Kuomintang would come, but who knew that after they came, they demanded 100,000 in business tax today and 200,000 in some other tax tomorrow. The officials' wives bought fabrics but didn't pay for them, so we all lost our jobs." Now, the stores in the city have all put their goods on display.

　　Walking to the intersection, we were surrounded by thousands of people. Suddenly, someone recognized Mayor Zhang (the former mayor of the Tonghua Democratic Government), whom they had not seen for seven months, and shouted, "Mayor Zhang is here! Let's ask him to speak!" Mayor Zhang greeted the masses with great enthusiasm. Several citizens stepped forward to shake Mayor Zhang's hand tightly, and tears streamed down their faces without a word.

　　When the reporter entered the municipal government building, many citizens had already rushed ahead to wait for the mayor they had elected. They said to the mayor affectionately, "As soon as the Kuomintang ran away, we took care of the house. Look, the doors, windows, and glass are all intact!" It is remembered that after the Democratic Allied Army and the democratic government withdrew from the city last year, the masses smashed and moved away many objects, waiting for the "takeover" by Chiang's army.

　　通化巡礼
    【新华社辽东二十九日电】记者随着民主政府人员进入刚被解放的通化市，首先展开在眼前的是市郊林立的碉堡，仅二道江、仙人洞一带山上，就有二百多个。附近村屯的楂子都未刨，大片土地被荒芜了。
    在市中心区，各界代表拿着各色旗子，夹道欢迎，高呼着：“我们的政府、回来了！”一个店东跟记者谈：“原先我们都盼国民党来，那知道来了以后，今天要营业税十万，明天又是什么税二十万，官太太们买了衣料不付钱，因此我们都失了业。”现在，市内的商店都把货物摆出来了。
    走到十字街头，我们被千百群众包围起来，突然有人发现了相别七个月的张市长（即前通化民主政府市长），便高声欢呼：“张市长来了，我们请他讲话！”张市长应接不暇的向群众慰问，当时好几个市民上前紧握着张市长的手，一言未发，就掉下了眼泪。
    当记者走进市政府时，许多市民早已抢先赶去等待着他们自己所选举的市长，他们亲切地对市长说：“国民党一跑，我们就把房子看管着，你看门、窗、玻璃都没有坏一点呀！”记得去年民主联军与民主政府撤离该市后，群众却打毁与搬走了许多物件，等待蒋军的“劫收”。
