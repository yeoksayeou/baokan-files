　　Communication and Reporting Work Transformed People
　　Fang De
　　In Li Wenbo's battalion, I heard many vivid stories, all of which illustrate how our communication and reporting work transformed people.
　　Jiang Pucheng had just been liberated from Shaoerzhai and always wanted to sneak back home. He even secretly plotted with the six liberated soldiers who came with him to desert together. Later, after seeing that there were also liberated soldiers among the heroes of his company who were also reported in the newspaper, he said a heartfelt truth during the speak bitterness campaign: "The Kuomintang side is where officials are rich, the people are poor, and the soldiers deserve to die!" This statement was published in the battlefield newspaper. He said, "I served in the Kuomintang for seven years and never saw a soldier mentioned in the newspaper. The Eighth Route Army truly does not bury talent. As soon as there is something good, it's reported! The superiors even said I had made progress." He took this newspaper and read it everywhere in the squad. Then he was promoted to mutual aid team leader and worked even harder. He killed two enemies with two shots at Jinxiang and captured seven prisoners alive at Zhanwanglou, which was again reported in the newspaper and led to his promotion to squad leader.
　　During a battle in the Yubei Campaign, Shi Mingsan stayed behind with the baggage train. While sorting the straw, he found a pistol under a mat. He was so happy that he jumped up, thinking he would be credited and reported again. Then, upon further searching, he found a leather belt and a small red sweater. He thought, "I should keep these things for myself!" He immediately put them on. When he delivered the gun to the instructor, he was not only not credited but was criticized for violating discipline, and the small red sweater and belt were confiscated and awarded to the communication worker Datou.
　　Shi Mingsan returned to the stable and lay down, thinking, "I am a veteran soldier, and I have been reported in the newspaper, and I have been a model... Alas!" Angrily, he couldn't help but say to Yao Zhenqing, "After I was reported in the newspaper, the horses were fed so fat, and I even saved eight hundred catties of feed. I have never violated discipline since being reported in the newspaper. Am I crazy? Why did I covet this small sweater and belt?!" Battalion Commander Li Wenbo gave Shi Mingsan the article about his transformation clipped from the Jilu Yu Daily and the two hundred yuan in manuscript fees, also instructing him, "If you can't figure it out, ask someone to read it to you." After three or four days, Shi Mingsan slowly figured it out, and he became active again, not only doing his own job well but also helping others.

　　通讯报导工作改造了人
    方德
    在李文波营里我听到了许多生动的故事，这些故事，都说明了我们的通讯报导工作改造了人。
    姜浦成刚从邵耳砦解放过来，总想偷跑回家，还秘密活动和他一同过来的六个解放战士，一块开小差。后来见到自己连队的英雄里也有解放战士，也上了报，他在诉苦运动中说了一句真心话：“中央军那边是官富民穷兵该死！”这段话在战地报上登出来。他说：“我在中央军干了七年没有见一个当兵的上过报，八路军真不埋没人材，一有好处就上报啦！上级还说我进步了”。他把这张报纸拿到班里到处念。接着又提拔他当了互助组长，更加起劲干。打金乡两枪毙两敌，战王楼活捉七个俘虏，这又上了报并提成班长。
    豫北战役某次战斗中，石明三跟了大车行李留在后面，理铺草的时候在席子底下发现了一支手枪，他心里欢喜得跳起来，这回又该记功上报了。再往后一找，又发现了有一条皮带，一个小红毛衣，他想：“这东西留下自己用罢！”马上就穿戴起来，等他把枪送到教导员那里的时候，不仅没记功反而批评他犯了纪律，把小红毛衣和皮带没收奖给通讯员大头了。
    石明三回到马号里躺着想：“我是老战士，也上过报，也当了模范……唉！”气的他忍不住向姚振青说：“我上报以后，马喂得多胖，还省了八百斤料，登报到现在永没犯过纪律。我疯啦，为什么贪图这小毛衣，皮带呢？！”营长李文波把从冀鲁豫日报剪寄来的石明三转变那篇文章，和二百元稿费都给了石明三，还嘱咐他说：“那会儿想不通了，那会儿请人家念念。”过了三、四天，石明三慢慢想通了，他又积极起来，除做好自己的工作，还帮助了别人。
