Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Front, June 8th: This reporter, Tian Fang, reports: Ma Dianbang, the regimental commander of the 179th Regiment of the 81st Division of Ma Hongbin's army, a Kuomintang captured in the Longdong Jiangtai battle, is the first Hui middle-ranking officer captured by the Northwest People's Liberation Army on the Longdong battlefield. After the battle, a certain general of the People's Liberation Army met with Ma Dianbang at the battlefield headquarters. When Regiment Commander Ma saw the simple and amiable-looking PLA commander, he stood respectfully at attention with a surprised expression. The general shook hands with him with a smile. Then this Hui officer, with a flat, round face and a few sparse whiskers, unexpectedly sat down with ease. When the general ordered the guards to make tea for him, this Muslim was even more surprised. Before the general could speak, he spoke first: "When Hu Zongnan occupied Yan'an, he ordered us to coordinate our actions with a fierce air. But soon after Hu Zongnan occupied Yan'an, we felt uneasy and delayed the second part of Hu's plan to occupy Wuqi County. Now it has indeed come to us." He said with emotion, "We are not interested in cooperating with Hu Zongnan to attack the border area. Now we only feel that we have taken the wrong path." The general comforted him and pointed out: "Hu Zongnan only knows how to use you miscellaneous troops. Your equipment and supplies cannot keep up with him. After you are defeated, can Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan replenish you?" When "miscellaneous troops" was mentioned, Ma recalled: "I remember in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Sun Dianying to be the Qinghai Reclamation Superintendent and secretly ordered Ma Hongkui to eliminate Sun Dianying on the way. As a result, Sun Dianying failed, and Ma Hongkui also suffered heavy losses. What a sinister plan to kill two birds with one stone. If Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan hadn't wanted to use the Hui army to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region in recent years, we would have been eliminated long ago." Finally, the general told him: We respect your Islamic beliefs and customs, advocate national self-determination, and resolutely oppose Chiang Hu's Han chauvinism. Among your Hui people, only those who are willing to be driven by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and be enemies with the people of the whole country will share the same fate as Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan. We want to unite and cooperate with the Hui people, defeat Hu Zongnan, liberate the Great Northwest, and build a new China. At this point, Ma Dianbang suddenly felt excited and said repeatedly: "I completely believe this is the truth."

　　陇东被俘蒋军回民团长
    愤恨蒋党消灭杂牌
    【新华社陕北前线八日电】本社记者田方报导：陇东蒋台战斗中俘获之蒋军马鸿宾部八十一师一七九团团长马奠邦，是西北人民解放军在陇东战场上所俘获之第一个回民中级军官。战斗结束后解放军某将军即接见马奠邦于战地指挥部，当马团长看见士兵模样朴素而和蔼的解放军指挥员时，他以惊疑的神情，立正的姿势，必恭必敬地站立着。某将军含笑和他握手。于是这位扁圆脸孔上留着几根稀疏胡须的回民军官，出乎意料之外地轻松地坐下了。当某将军命警卫员为其煮茶时，这位回教徒更加惊讶。未等某将军开言就先开口了：“当胡宗南占领延安时，他气势凶凶命令我们策应行动，但在胡宗南占延安后不久，我们即觉得不妙，迟迟没有执行胡规定的占领吴起县的第二部计划。现在果然轮到我们头上来了。”他感慨地说：“我们对配合胡宗南进攻边区并不感到兴趣，现在只感到路走错了。”某将军当加以安慰，并指出：“胡宗南只知利用你们杂牌军的。你们的装备给养都赶不上他，打垮之后蒋介石胡宗南还能给你们补充么？”提到，“杂牌”，马回忆说：“记得民国廿二年，蒋介石一面令孙殿英作青海屯垦督办，同时又密令马鸿逵在途中消灭孙殿英，结果孙殿英失败，马鸿逵损失也很大。这是何等阴险的一双箭雕的毒计。如果蒋介石胡宗南这几年不是想利用回回军打陕甘宁边区，我们早就被他们消灭了。”最后某将军告以：我们尊重你们回教的信仰与习惯，主张民族自决，坚决反对蒋胡的大汉族主义。你们回族中有甘心受卖国贼蒋介石的驱使，与全国人民为敌者，才会与蒋介石胡宗南同其命运。我们是要与回族团结合作，打败胡宗南，解放大西北，建设新中国的。至此，马奠邦顿觉兴奋，连说：“我完全相信这是真理”。
