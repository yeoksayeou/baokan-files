Li Cheng Carries Out Production Movement Experience
    Liu Jianfu
            First, Ideological Mobilization for Large-Scale Production
    Li Cheng's production movement this year started by promoting positive factors, thoroughly resolving some peasants' negative thoughts, and clarifying the production policy. The specific experiences are:
    I. Concentrate the masses' positive demands from the bottom up, and integrate the peasants' enthusiasm for emancipation into production and support for the front lines.
    1.  Use the method of promoting righteousness to inspire peasants to discuss what their demands are after emancipation. In the discussion, the peasants' voices are: In the past, we thought about land so much that we got sick. Although we have been allocated some land now, it is still an empty shell. We must work hard for production. Land is a gold scraper; the more you plant, the bigger it gets. It won't work if you don't work. We also discussed what these demands are for, so that the peasants unified their understanding that getting rich is the basic requirement after emancipation. This method was also used in organizing drought resistance and sowing, so that the masses clearly understood that if they want to plant the land earlier, they must carry out the struggle against drought. Seeing seedlings means a thirty percent harvest, and we must seize the time to plant quickly. The movement was launched rapidly.
    2. From clarifying positive thoughts, praising active efforts to get rich and fight drought, we also put forward specific action slogans: Chairman Mao led us to emancipation, and he will further lead us to get rich, pull out the roots of poverty and plant the roots of wealth, learn from the new rich peasant Shi Cunjin, combine agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year, realize the goal of "cultivating three and saving one" in every household, and have the strength to eliminate feudalism, and also have more strength to overcome drought. We should plant the land without waiting for rain, and we should eat without relying on waiting for heaven. This enables the masses to clarify their action goals in the struggle to get rich and fight drought, and vigorously and comprehensively carry out the movement.
    3. Through current affairs education, the masses understand the harm of the Chiang-American commercial treaty to their vital interests, and arouse the masses' hatred for Chiang and the United States. Combined with the propaganda of the victory of the self-defense war, we called for preparing for a major counter-offensive to increase the masses' enthusiasm for active production and support for the front lines. For example, the masses in villages such as Huo Jia Yao originally only knew that Chiang Kai-shek was a big traitor who sold out the country and relied on American imperialism, but they did not know how he sold out the country. After education and discussion, they realized that he had sold our Chinese land and textiles, so that we could not be emancipated, nor could we get rich, and we would still be hungry and work like beasts of burden. He is the first big traitor since ancient times, and we must defeat him. Combined with victory propaganda, after discussing how we should counter-attack, they generally proposed to plant the land well and weave more, and volunteer for support and participation in the war, and based on this, they proposed meritorious service conditions and launched a mass meritorious service movement. In this way, production consciousness is combined with the political consciousness of defeating Chiang Kai-shek and supporting the front lines, which provides a greater guarantee for the victorious completion of this year's production and participation in the war tasks.
    II. While clarifying positive thoughts and supporting active factors, inspire the masses to tell the truth, discover and solve negative thoughts.
    1. To solve the "cutting leeks" mentality, conduct practical education through typical specific people. For example, Shi Cunjin, Lan Shu, and Liu Qiusheng are all newly promoted rich peasants. From talking about his experience in getting rich and his understanding of land investigation last winter, he explained that laboring to get rich is not only not a struggle, but also guaranteed, and called on everyone to actively produce.
    2. Solve the ideological concerns of being afraid of merging and "communizing." When the masses in Beiliu and Beishe discussed, they said: If we were to communize, why was the distribution of fruits last winter so meticulous, and why did we repeatedly demand fairness, and even after the distribution, we had to pay the deed tax, and the two brothers still cultivated their own land. A farmer in Bei Hong also pointed out that although he had been emancipated, he was still very poor, and if five people merged, three pairs of pants would still not be enough. He had to work hard to get rich. In short, according to experience, as long as we grasp the positive factors, it will have the effect of overcoming negative thoughts, so it is the best way to solve negative thoughts. This is a further development of the experience of mobilizing the poor and hired peasants to unite all the peasants last winter in the production movement.
    III. From organizing the masses to discuss how to get rich, clarify the goal of universally realizing "cultivating three and saving one," and mobilize the masses to fully carry out the large-scale production movement.
    After the masses unanimously clarified the direction of getting rich, they further clarified the principles and paths of getting rich through discussion. Generally, combined with last year's experience, we must focus on agriculture and combine sideline occupations to implement weaving, and pay attention to the promotion of improved varieties and technologies to specifically realize "cultivating three and saving one." And use the method of checking last year's surplus grain and calculation to emphasize universal realization rather than average realization. Overcome the complacent thinking that if we cultivated one and saved one last year, we can cultivate one and save one and a half this year, so as to correctly set out this year's struggle policy. In addition, due to the existence of a waiting mentality among the masses, even if there are fewer ideological concerns, if the leading role of cadres and heroic activists is not brought into play, the development of the movement will not be strong. Therefore, we generally make plans through cadres, heroes, and military families, and then organize the masses to discuss and promote them, and inspire the peasants to make plans for their own path to getting rich. The rapid development of drought resistance and sowing was also due to the fact that cadres and heroes took the lead in breaking through their own teams and acting actively, which affected the entire peasantry and overcame the natural waiting mentality of "old farmers don't need to ask, just do what others do."
            Second, New Development of Organization
    Because Li Cheng has three years of large-scale production, especially the experience of combining agriculture and sideline occupations last year, under the circumstances of busy war service and relatively scarce labor, it has created a new form of labor organization that combines agriculture, sideline occupations, and war service, which is a feature of this year's production. Specific experiences:
    I. In terms of organizational form:
    1. Dong Shousong of Beishe created a land cooperative, which is to invest land according to output; labor is invested according to work, and the amount is calculated according to how much is invested. Production costs (seeds, fertilizers, etc.) are planned uniformly. At the end of autumn, the land is used as capital for labor-capital dividend distribution, and the capital dividends of the land are divided equally according to the output of the land invested by each household. In order to solve the freedom of eating vegetables for each household, one or two acres are reserved for self-cultivation.
    2. In villages such as Sihuangxu and Langou, a village-wide labor-capital mutual aid cooperative was created. The entire society's production is currently based on agriculture, combined with sideline occupations and capital. Capital (including handicrafts) is also made into labor, with 10,000 yuan per month converted into three units of labor for calculating investment and dividend distribution, and comprehensive labor exchange and production are carried out for agriculture and sideline occupations (including organizing transportation, small-scale oil pressing, carpentry, etc.). Women's weaving is produced according to the standard of men's labor, which is divided into ten points. This makes it easy to bring out the strengths of each person, carry out unified labor exchange production, and also absorb all semi-labor and auxiliary labor to participate in production. Whoever invests how much work can get wages and dividends according to the work invested. The wages of each household's land are borne by themselves, and war service tasks such as participating in the war and supporting the difference in cultivation are uniformly combined with labor exchange production. Because it is mainly based on agriculture, the basic activity unit is still the mutual aid group's mutual labor exchange. The cooperative uniformly leads the issuance of work tickets. In addition, specialized division of labor draws out surplus labor to carry out relatively fixed production such as weaving handicrafts. Therefore, the combination with war service is also based on the labor situation of each team combined with the production situation, and the settlement of accounts uniformly removes the labor required for its own land and the war service work to be borne before dividend distribution. Therefore, all cadres of the village participate in the leadership of the society. In addition to the president and vice president of the society, there are also agriculture, sideline occupations, war service, propaganda, commendation, technology survey, statistics, and evaluation (mainly carried out regularly to evaluate work) and other shares, which uniformly carry out the village's three-way combination of production movement. This form is generally suitable for smaller villages and those with a strong base point or leadership backbone to be easily consolidated and developed.
    3. Shi Cunjin is a cooperative that combines agriculture and labor-capital transportation with war service in a unified natural village. Other more common methods are to carry out agricultural and sideline occupations and war service in a group or team (weaving is not combined and carried out separately). There are also many groups and teams that combine agricultural production and war service to exchange labor production, which is more common in villages with a poor foundation. In short, this is a further new creation based on last year's combination of agriculture and sideline occupations to adapt to the current war situation.
    II. In terms of equal value exchange, labor exchange, and dividend distribution, there has been further progress compared to last year in the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. Most of the surplus labor is approved in large batches, and all labor in the group is also approved in part. Because surplus labor exists not only in itself, but also in the mutual aid production of the entire group or team. However, if the difference in labor and land between the entire group and team is not large, the number of workers is approved in large batches, and a small amount is awarded to the remaining labor. If the disparity is larger, the remaining labor is the main focus, and those who participate in the entire group are approved to be part of it. In terms of combining with war service, there are three methods. One is that in addition to eating in public, each unit of labor is calculated at twelve points. Another is that it is not rewarded to eat public meals, and one unit of labor is calculated at ten points. Huo Jia Yao is in addition to rewarding public meals, and generally one unit of labor is calculated at ten points of mutual assistance, and meritorious service is appropriately added by one point or two points. Combined with supporting the difference in cultivation, generally one unit of labor is equivalent to one unit of labor, calculated at ten points, and those who do more according to regulations are calculated in a flexible manner.
            Third, Combining the Solution of Legacy Issues in Production
    Because the peasants of Li Cheng have three years of experience and habits in large-scale production, they generally demand to carry out production as soon as the spring ploughing arrives. The leadership grasped the demands of the masses and transferred the leadership of the large-scale production movement in March. However, due to the loopholes and defects existing in the movement, it was determined to thoroughly solve the legacy issues in the widespread mobilization of the masses to carry out large-scale production.
    The specific experience is that, in addition to the above-mentioned combination of production and in-depth production mobilization, in terms of cutting off the tail, it is combined with production, cadres go deep into the poor and hired, understand ideological requirements, and mobilize the peasants to compare life with the landlords to recognize whether the tail has been cut off completely. How is our peasant emancipation at the end? According to preliminary statistics, eight villages in a base point in Henan have cut out more than 100 acres of land and more than 100 good houses, and have replenished the peasants who have not been emancipated enough. Now there are still a small number of villages that are still solving the problem in combination with production.
            Fourth, Unified Leadership in Large-Scale Production
    The masses not only require a high degree of organization to carry out production, but also require a more unified leadership force to carry out the production movement. Therefore, a unified leadership organization centered on production, combining war service, martial arts practice, public security, learning, etc., was created within the group or team. In the production movement, the work of each department is completed in combination. In terms of production within the team, there are also divisions of labor such as agriculture, sideline occupations, technology, and accounting. In this way, it overcomes the past problem of one person going to this group today to hold a meeting and going to that group tomorrow to solve a problem, which wastes the people's strength. Some village-level leadership organizations are also like this. But the most important thing is the unified leadership of the branch, especially the branch committee and branch secretary should regard each system as a part of the force to complete the central task. From different aspects, we should guarantee the completion of the task. And those who are responsible for the work of the department should realize that they are an entire part of the Party. The central task of the Party in each period should first be carried out and completed with their own part of the force, and their own departmental work should be carried out in combination with the central task. Villages such as Beiliu are doing this. Regarding the issue of unified leadership, various places are continuing to create experience in order to better and forcefully lead this year's large-scale production.

　　黎城开展生产运动经验
    刘健夫
            第一、大生产的思想动员
    黎城今年的生产运动，是从发扬积极因素贯彻解决部分农民消极思想，明确生产方针而开展起来的，具体经验是：
    一、自下而上集中群众正面要求，把农民翻身热情贯穿到生产与支援前线中去。
    １、以发扬正气的方法，启发农民讨论翻身后要求是什么。在讨论中，农民的呼声是：过去想地想成病了，现在虽然分了些土地，还是个空架子，可得好好生产哩。地是刮金板，越种越大，不劳动可不行。又讨论这些要求是为了什么？使农民统一认识发家致富是翻身后的基本要求。在组织抗旱下种中也运用这方法，使群众明确要想早些种上地，必须开展抗旱斗争，见苗三分收，趁垧快抢种的道理，运动便迅速开展起来。
    ２、从明确正面思想，表扬积极发家抗旱斗争中，且提出具体行动口号：是毛主席领导我们翻了身，更进一步要领导咱们发家致富，拔了穷根栽富根，学习新富农石寸金，农副业结合贯彻全年，耕三余一家家实现，有力量消灭封建，也更有力量战胜天旱，该种地不等雨，要吃饭不靠天等，使群众在发家抗旱斗争中，更明确行动目标，有力全面开展运动。
    ３、通过时事教育，使群众了解蒋美商约对切身利益的危害，激发群众对蒋美仇恨。结合自卫战争胜利宣传，号召准备大反攻，以提高群众积极生产与支援前线的热情。如霍家窑等村群众，原先只知蒋介石大汉奸卖国，依靠美帝国主义，而不知如何卖国，经教育与讨论后，认识了原来是把咱中国的土地与纺织都卖了，使咱不能翻身，也不能发家，再饿肚当牛马，是自古以来第一个大汉奸，非打垮不行。又结合胜利宣传，经讨论咱怎样反攻，普遍提出更要好好种地，多纺织，支差参战都自动，且以此提出立功条件，开展了群众性的立功运动。这样使生产自觉与打垮蒋介石支援前线的政治自觉结合起来，使胜利完成今年生产与参战任务上更有了保障。
    二、在明确正面思想，扶持积极因素中，启发群众说老实话，发现与解决消极思想。
    １、解决割韭菜思想，是通过典型具体人进行实际教育。如石寸金与兰淑刘秋生均新升富农，从谈他的发家经验及去冬查田的认识，说明劳动发家不但不斗争，而且还保障，号召大家积极生产。
    ２、解决怕并伙“共产”的思想顾虑。北流、北社群众讨论时说：要共产为什么去冬分果实还那样细，还三番五次要公道，分得后还税契，弟兄二人还是各种各的。北虹一农民且提出现在虽然翻了身，但还很穷，并了伙五个人三条裤还是个不够用，非得好好劳动发家不行，总之根据经验，只要抓正面的积极因素，其本身就带有克服消极思想的作用，因之它是解决消极思想的最好办法，这是去冬发动贫雇团结全体农民的经验在生产运动中的进一步发挥。
    三、从组织群众讨论如何发家致富中，明确普遍实现耕三余一奋斗目标，动员群众全力开展大生产运动。
    在群众一致明确发家致富方向后，又通过讨论如何发家，更明确了发家的方针与道路。一般的是结合去年经验，要以农业为主结合副业贯彻纺织，注意推广优良品种技术，来具体实现耕三余一。且用检查去年余粮及计算的方法，强调普遍实现而不是平均实现。克服了认为去年耕一余一，今年可以耕一余一年半之自满思想，来正确订出今年之奋斗方针。此外由于群众中存在一种等待思想，虽然思想上顾虑少了，但如不发挥干部与英雄积极分子之带头作用，对运动的开展还不会有力。所以我们订计划，一般均通过干部、英雄、军属进行，再组织群众讨论推广，启发农民对自己发家方针上做个打算。抗旱下种的迅速开展上，也是干部、英雄先突破自己组积极行动起来，影响整个农民，克服了“庄稼老汉不用问，人家做什咱做什”的自然等待思想。
            第二、组织起来的新发展
    由于黎城有三年大生产，特别去年农副业结合的经验，在战勤繁忙，劳力比较缺乏情况下，创造了各种农副业战勤三大结合的劳力组织新形式，这是今年生产中一个特点，具体经验：
    一、在组织形式上：
    １、北社董寿松创造了土地合作社，是把土地按产量入股；劳力以工入股，入多少以多少算，生产中之费用（种籽肥料等）统一计划，到秋罢土地作为资本进行劳资分红，土地的资本红利按各户所入土地产量均分。为了解决各户吃菜自由，留一、二亩自种。
    ２、在四黄须、兰沟等村是创造了全村性劳资互助合作社，全社生产在目前是以农业为主结合副业与资金。资金（手工业在内）也作成劳力工，每月一万元折三个人力工计算入股分红，进行农业副业（包括组织运输小型榨油木工等）全面变工与生产。妇女纺织以男人标准工十分来订分进行生产，这样容易发挥各人之长，进行统一变工生产，也吸收了一切半劳力及辅助劳力参加生产。谁入多少工，就能按入工得工资与分红，各户土地的工资由自己负担，且与参战支差代耕等战勤任务统一结合变工生产。由于以农为主，所以基本活动单位还是互助小组的相互变工。由社统一领导发工票。此外专门分工抽出剩余劳力进行纺织手工业等比较固定的生产。所以与战勤结合也是根据各队劳力情况结合生产情况派拨，结算账时统一除去自己地需用工及应负战勤工外，进行分红，因此全村的各干部均参加了社的领导。全社除正副社长，又分农副战勤宣传表扬技术调查统计评判（主要经常进行以活评工）等股，统一进行全村三大结合的生产运动，这种形式一般宜在较小的村庄及有基点或领导骨干较强者才易巩固发展。
    ３、石寸金是以自然村统一结合的农业与劳资运输及战勤结合的合作社。其它一般比较普遍的，是以大组或队来进行农副业及战勤结合的办法进行生产（纺织不结合单独进行生产）。还有不少组、队是农业生产与战勤结合变工生产，这是在基础较差的村庄较多。总之这是在去年农副结合基础上适应目前战争情况的进一步新创造。
    二、等价交换变工分红上，在农副结合方面比去年进了一步，大部分是剩余劳力多批，而全组所有劳力也批一部分。因为剩余劳力除本身就有外，全组或队互助生产也有关系的。但全组、队劳力土地差额不大的，则以编入工数多批，再抽少部奖给剩余劳力。如悬殊大一些的，则以剩余劳力为主，且使全组入工者批一部分。与战勤结合方面，有三种办法，一种是参战人除吃公家外，每工以十二分计，一种是不奖励吃公家饭一工计十分。霍家窑是除奖吃公家饭外，一般一工按互助十分计算，立功适当加一分或二分。与支差代耕结合，一般是一工顶一工，以十分计，按规定多做者以活计分。
            第三、在生产中结合解决遗留问题
    由于黎城农民有了三年大生产的经验与习惯，所以春耕一到，便普遍要求开展生产，领导上掌握群众要求，于三月份转上大生产运动的领导，但由于运动中存在着的漏洞与缺陷，所以确定了从普遍发动群众开展大生产中，贯彻解决遗留问题。
    具体经验是，除以上结合生产深入生产动员外，在割尾巴上，是结合生产，干部深入贫雇，了解思想要求，发动农民与地主比生活，认识尾巴割彻底了没有？咱农民翻身到底如何？据初步统计，河南一个基点八个村，共割出地一百多亩，好房一百多间，补给了翻身不够的农民，现还有少数村庄仍结合生产解决中。
            第四、大生产中的统一领导
    群众不但要求高度的组织起来进行生产，也要求更统一领导力量来开展生产运动，因此，又在组或队内创造了以生产为中心的结合战勤、练武、公安、学习等统一领导机构，在生产运动中，结合进行完成各个部门工作，在队内生产方面，还有农副业、技术、会计等分工，这样便克服了过去一个人今天到这个组开个会，明天到那个组解决个问题的浪费民力的毛病。村级领导机构也有些是这样的。但最主要者还是支部的统一领导，特别是支委支书应把各个系统当成完成中心任务的一部分力量。从不同的方面来保证任务的完成。而负责部门工作者，应认识自己是党的整个一部分，党各时期的中心任务，首应以自己一部分力量去进行与完成，并在结合中心任务中进行自己的部门工作。北流等村即这样进行，关于统一领导问题，各地正在继续创造经验，以便更好的有力领导今年大生产。
