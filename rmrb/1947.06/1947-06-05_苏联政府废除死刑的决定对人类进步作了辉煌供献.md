Socialism is Solidified and Strong - The Soviet Union Abolishes the Death Penalty

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS reports: Moscow newspapers have published editorials on the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union abolishing the death penalty, unanimously emphasizing that this move is a new proof of the strength and consolidation of the Soviet socialist system. It also pointed out that although reactionary foreign aggressors and warmongers are trying to incite new wars, because the Soviet Union adheres to a foreign policy of consolidating peace and international cooperation, all nations and all people are united in a solid family of brotherly love, becoming builders and defenders of socialist life, and the people of all countries need peace and oppose war. In this case, the Soviet Union does not need the death penalty in peacetime. The newspaper Izvestia, in its editorial entitled "A New Proof of Soviet Power," stated: "The complete victory of the Soviet way of life, the amazing progress of the Soviet people in morality and politics, and the close integration of all forces in our country are now vividly manifested once again... The power of the powerful peace-loving Soviet Union has grown into such a decisive international force that its voice and influence are enough to paralyze every attempt of the enemies of peace." The Red Star editorial, "The Victory of Socialist Humanitarianism," stated: "The Soviet government's decision to abolish the death penalty is a splendid contribution to the cause of progress for all mankind." The Labor Daily wrote in its editorial entitled "Historical Document": "The facts are different in the United States, Britain, France, China, and other countries. Despite the years of struggle by progressive forces to abolish the death penalty, it is still preserved in current laws. Daily facts prove that the death penalty is rarely unused as a weapon of political terror in capitalist countries to suppress revolutionary movements and national liberation struggles. ... Although the enemy will still attempt to recruit agents in our country, the Soviet people are the most politically mature in the world. They are all patriotic and outstanding people who can recognize the enemy; no matter how the enemy disguises themselves, they will not succeed. The Soviet Union announced to the world: A truly democratic system has been so consolidated and strengthened in our country that we no longer need to use such harsh punishments as the death penalty to deal with our enemies."

　　苏联政府废除死刑的决定对人类进步作了辉煌供献
    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社讯：莫斯科各报对于苏联最高苏维埃主席团废除死刑的法令，均发表社论，一致强调此举是苏维埃社会主义制度强大巩固的新的证明。并指出：虽然反动的外国侵略分子和战争贩子力图煽起新的战火，但由于苏联坚持着巩固和平与国际合作的外交政策，一切民族与全体人民都团结在一个巩固的兄弟般友爱的大家庭里，成为社会主义生活的建造者与卫士，而世界各国人民也正需要和平反对战争。在这种情况下，苏联在和平时期就不需要死刑了。消息报以“苏联力量的新证明”为题的社论称：“苏联生活方式的完全胜利，苏联人民在道德上和政治上惊人的长进，我国社会一切力量密切结合，现在再一次生动表现出来……。强大爱好和平的苏联的力量，已经成长为这样一个有决定性的国际力量，它的声音和影响都足以使和平的敌人的每一企图变为瘫痪无力。”红星报社论“社会主义的人道主义之胜利”中称：“苏联政府废除死刑的决定，对全人类的进步事业作了辉煌的供献。”劳动报在题为“历史性的文件”社论中写道：“在美国、英国、法国、中国及其它国家，这方面的事实是不同的。不顾进步力量多少年来废除死刑的斗争，在现行法律中仍然保存着死刑。每天的事实证明，死刑在资本主义国家是很少不用作政治恐怖的武器以镇压革命运动和民族解放斗争的。……尽管敌人仍会企图在我国招募代理人，但苏联人民在世界上是政治上最成熟的，他们都是爱国的优秀分子，能够辨认敌人；不论敌人如何乔装打扮，是不会得手的。苏联向全世界宣布：真正民主的制度已在我国如此巩固而坚强，我们已无需用死刑这些样严厉的惩罚来对付我们的敌手了。”
