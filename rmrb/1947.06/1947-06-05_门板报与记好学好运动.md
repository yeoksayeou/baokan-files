　　Blackboard Newspapers and the Movement to Record the Good and Learn from the Good
    Wu Xiang
            1. “Now we have our own base area too!”
    I have seen many blackboard newspapers, none as neat and beautiful as the wall newspapers of the past. The paper is square, triangular, or crumpled, the writing is in pencil, pen, or brush, of varying sizes and colors. "Zhang Zhongwen helped me husk rice, and he worked very hard," is one entry. "Li Chunhai sweeps the floor very clean, and the villagers are happy," is another. The cartoons are even more diverse and strange, with tears bigger than eyes and fingers thicker than arms. But this is precisely the soldiers' own creation, and the soldiers' praise for their comrades can encourage their revolutionary enthusiasm more than anything else. No matter how ungrammatical the sentences, how many typos there are, or how simple the content, the blackboard newspapers do not refuse to publish them. Therefore, the blackboard newspapers have broken away from all the ordinary forms of wall newspapers in the past and have gained the broadest mass character. The number of contributors in many companies has reached 80% to 90% of the total. Even during the most exhausting long marches or tense battles, they can still insist on publishing, exerting unexpected power. One soldier said: "Now that we have blackboard newspapers, we have our own base area for writing articles!" The words "base area" express such deep love and affection.
    Suited to the soldiers' own level, this is the characteristic of blackboard newspapers, and it is also the characteristic of the movement to record the good and learn from the good. The so-called "good" is certainly not about special meritorious deeds. As long as it is slightly higher than the general level, for example, everyone does not fall behind during the march, and you do not fall behind either, and you can also help others carry things, that is considered good; or if you have improved one step according to your specific situation, such as you used to fall behind, but now you do not fall behind like everyone else, that is also considered good. Therefore, everyone feels that there is hope for recording the good, and everything has the possibility of becoming good. Thus, recording the good and learning from the good immediately formed a mass movement, pushing all personnel and all work to accelerate forward; however, recording the good and learning from the good does not replace meritorious service. Everyone being good does not mean that heroes are not needed. On the contrary, it is a deeper development of the meritorious service movement, using finding the good and learning from the good to lead the way, so that the general public is mobilized, and relatively complete models are discovered in the general movement to cultivate outstanding heroes.
    In fact, once the masses are mobilized, they will demand improvement themselves. The good is divided into "squad good," "platoon good," and "company good." "Company good" is equivalent to a minor merit. Those who have recorded the good will definitely want to make further meritorious achievements. Many people have recorded the good and want to make further meritorious achievements. As a result, the standards for good have gradually increased. For example, in many units of the × unit, not only is not falling behind not considered good, but helping others carry things is not considered good, and helping villagers carry water is not considered good unless there are particularly many difficulties, because helping villagers carry water has become very common. During the westward advance, the leadership proposed the "Three Don'ts" movement: "1. Don't leave if financial and grain procedures are not clear. 2. Don't leave if borrowed items are not returned. 3. Don't leave if the ground is not swept clean." Whoever does well will be recorded as good. Later, everyone did it, and they automatically added: (4) Don't leave if the water tank is not full. (5) Don't leave if the seedlings are damaged. (6) Don't leave if there is no propaganda. In the "Three Don'ts" movement, 9,000 soldiers were recorded as good, and there also appeared propaganda heroes, slogan heroes, and mass work heroes, with many moving deeds.
    The blackboard newspapers are not always the same either. As more and more are published, the quality of the articles also gradually improves. A comrade named Liu Xiu, who originally only wrote articles with three or two points, can now write long rhyming stories. Here is one: "Speaking of wonders, speaking of wonders, the platoon leader's work is really active. If you ask who he is, it is Han Debi of the first platoon. The three major characteristics are there: training in bayonet and killing enemies, coming up with ideas all day long. Talking to people very often, enlivening the troops with smiles. He has many characteristics, and shortcomings should also be noted. When he gets anxious, he likes to glare, and he even wants to hit people. We ask the platoon leader to change quickly, otherwise there will be problems."
            2. Please open another eye
    During the few days I lived in the Yi character unit, the deepest impression was "should be recorded as good." Because I heard this sentence too many times. There was a regiment that, after five days and six nights of intense offensive and defensive battles, withdrew for rest, but none of the lightly wounded soldiers wanted to go to the hospital. They were still discussing who should be recorded as "squad good" and who should be recorded as "company good," and who they should learn from in the next battle. I saw a comrade who was wounded by shrapnel, his nose, ears, and face all wrapped in bandages, only revealing two eyes. He took out his article from his small pocket and solemnly and happily posted it on the blackboard newspaper. He also told me that as soon as they repelled the KMT army's counterattack, they would find the good, record the good, and publish the report in the trenches. Ammunition boxes replaced blackboard newspapers, and they used their thighs as desks in the fortifications. This new heroic enthusiasm is constantly growing with the development of blackboard newspapers and the movement to record the good and learn from the good.
    The head of the health department was recorded as good. Once, there were not enough stretchers, and the head of the supply department and the section chief of the field political organ went to the front line to carry the wounded. However, the work foundation of this unit was relatively weak, and there were quite a few problems three months ago. The general opinion was that there were too few activists and the work could not be promoted. Why has it become so different in just three months? This is the power of the grievance-telling education and ideological rectification, and this is the power of blackboard newspapers and the movement to record the good and learn from the good. The former clarified the position of commanders and fighters to serve the people, and the latter further brought out the enthusiasm and creativity of commanders and fighters. Their leading cadres told me: "In fact, we used to only open one eye, only seeing the bad and not seeing the good; seeing more of the bad and very little of the good. Therefore, we always criticize, criticize, and the more we criticize, the less motivated everyone is." The leadership opened their eyes to see the good, that is to say, in the movement, not only should the good be promoted and the bad be overcome at the same time, but also greater efforts should be made to promote the good; not only should outstanding or complete good be praised, but also small, budding good should be praised. The soldiers are most aware of their own bravery, hardship, and grandeur. Therefore, they often feel proud and respectful of themselves and their contributions, but they do not have many opportunities to express this feeling. Blackboard newspapers and the movement to record the good and learn from the good happen to provide such opportunities, and provide them very often. Washing your feet is a time to find the good. Review meetings become meetings to find the good, recording it in the good record book and posting it on the blackboard newspaper. Whoever has something good can be praised in a timely manner. This praise encourages him to be even better, and also encourages others to follow suit. Marching does not delay recording the good and publishing blackboard newspapers. Now, fighting does not delay finding the good and publishing blackboard newspapers either. At first, the cadres took the lead in finding the good and writing articles to praise the soldiers. Later, the soldiers praised each other, and then praised the cadres again. The more often they did it, the more active everyone became, and the more energetic the work became. The cadres felt that the soldiers were too good, and that the previous lack of activists was due to their own poor leadership. The soldiers also felt that the cadres were too good, and that some difficulties should be understood.
    Finding the good and recording the good has become a trend, and things are indeed getting better everywhere. In one and a half months, 628 people were praised by the political department's combat report, an average of 13 people per day. In the × regiment's eleven-day blocking battle, there was not a single company without cadres being praised, and not a single company that did not write praise articles. As for the blackboard newspapers of each company, they were published every day, and the number of people being praised was too many to count. Some company commanders, administrators, and heads of health clinics have become enthusiastic editors of the blackboard newspapers themselves, because they feel that the blackboard newspapers are of great help to their own work, it is truly a booming mass movement! Comrades who still have one eye closed, please hurry up and open it to take a look. (To be continued)

　　门板报与记好学好运动
    吴象
            １“也有咱的根据地了”
    我见到的门板报很多，没有一张有过去一般墙报那样整齐与美观。纸是四方的、三角的、或者破绉的，字有铅笔的、钢笔的、还有毛笔的、大小不一，颜色不同，“张忠文邦（帮）我椿米，很吃苦”，是一段。“李春孩扫地很干（干）精（净），老乡高兴，”也算一篇。漫画更是五花八门，无奇不有，有的眼泪比眼睛还要大，指头比胳膊还要粗，而这正是战士自己的创造，战士对自己伙伴的歌颂比任何别的东西更能鼓舞其革命热情。这些稿子无论句子怎样不通，无论错别字怎么多，无论内容怎么简单，门板报都不拒绝刊登，因此门板报从过去一切形式平凡的墙报中冲出来，获得了最广泛的群众性。许多连队的投稿人都达到总人数的百分之八十至九十。最疲劳的长行军，甚至紧张的战斗中，仍能坚持出版，发挥着出人意料的威力，有一个战士说：“现在办了门板报也有咱写稿的根据地了。”“根据地”这三个字表现了何等深挚的爱和亲切呵。
    适合战士自己的水平，这是门板报的特点，也是记好学好运动的特点，所谓好当然不是特殊的功臣，只要比一般的水平略高一些，比如大家行军都不掉队，你也不掉队，而且还能帮人背东西，就算好；或者依据各人具体情况提高了一步，如你过去老掉队，现在和大家一样不掉队了，也就算好。因此任何人都感到有记好的希望，任何事情都有成为好的可能。于是记好学好立即形成群众性的运动，推动着一切人员，一切工作加速前进；然而记好学好并非代替了立功。大家都好，并非不要英雄，相反的是立功运动的深入发展，是用找好学好带头，使一般的都动起来，在普遍的运动中去发现比较完满的典型，培养出色的英雄。
    事实上群众一运动起来，自己就会要求提高。好分“班好”、“排好”、“连好”。“连好”三个顶一小功。记了好的人，一定想进一步立功，许多人都记了好，都想进一步立功，结果好的标准也逐渐提高了。比如×部队的许多单位，不仅不掉队不能算好，帮人背东西不能算好，帮老乡担水如果不是困难特别多，也都不能算好了，因为帮老乡担水已经非常普遍了。西进时领导上提出三不走运动，“一、财粮手续不清不走。二、借物不还不走。三、地扫不光不走。”谁做好了就给谁记好。后来大家都做到了，就自动加上（四）不满缸不走。（五）青苗地不走。（六）不宣传不走。三不走成了六不走了。六不走运动中有九千名战士被记了好，还出现了宣传英雄、标语英雄、群众工作英雄，动人的事迹非常多。
    门板报也不是老停留着的，出得多了稿子质量也慢慢提高了。有一位刘秀小同志原来写的稿子都只有三两点，现在会写成长的快板了。现抄一首如下：“说稀奇，道稀奇，排长工作真积极。若问他是那一个，就是一排韩得毕。三大特点在那里，教练刺枪与杀敌，一天到晚出主意。和人说话很经常，活跃部队笑嘻嘻。他的特点是不少，还有缺点应注意，着急起来好瞪眼，抬手还想去打人，要求排长快转变，不然就会出问题。”
            ２请再睁开一只眼睛
    我住在毅字部队那几天中，一个最深的印象是“应该记好”。因为这句话听到的回数太多了。他们有一个团，在连续五天六夜激烈的功防战后撤下来休整，但是全部的轻伤员没有一个愿去住医院，仍是在议论谁该记“班好”，谁该记“连好”，下次作战该向谁学。我见到一个被弹片炸伤了的同志，鼻子、耳朵、面颜都用绷带缠住了，只露两只眼睛。他从小口袋里掏出他写的稿子，郑重而又高兴地贴到门板报上去。他也告诉我，一打退蒋军反扑就在战壕里找好记好出报表扬。子弹箱代替了门板报，在工事里用大腿做案子。这种新英雄主义的热情，随着门板报与记好学好运动的开展而不断地增长。
    卫生处长被记了好。一次，担架不够，供给处长、野政机关的科长，都到火线上去抬彩号了，然而该部工作基础较弱，三个月前问题相当多，普遍的舆论是积极分子太少，工作推不动。为什么短短三个月会变得这样不同呢？这是诉苦教育整顿思想的力量，这是门板报与记好学好运动的力量。前者明确了指战员为人民服务的立场，后者更进一步把指战员的积极性创造性发挥了出来。他们的领导干部和我这样说：“事实上，我们过去只睁着一只眼，光看到坏的，看不到好的；坏的看见得多，好的看见得很少。因此总来批评、批评，越批评大家越没有劲”。领导上睁开了看好的眼睛，就是说在运动中不仅要同时发扬好的一面，克服坏的一面，而且要用更大的力量去发扬好的一面；不仅要表扬突出的或者圆满的好，而且要表扬微小的，萌芽的好。战士们最清楚自己的英勇艰苦壮烈。因此常常对自己和自己的功劳发生自豪与自尊的感觉，只是没有很多的机会让他来表现这个感觉。门板报和记好学好运动恰恰给了这样的机会，而且给得非常之多，洗脚的时候就是找好的时候。检讨会成了找好会，记到记好簿上贴到门板报上，谁有好处及时就可以得到表扬。这表扬鼓励了他更好，也鼓励别人跟着好起来，行军误不了记好出门板报，现在是战斗也误不了找好出门板报了。开始是干部带头领导找好，写稿子表扬战士，后来战士们互相表扬起来，又去表扬干部，愈经常大家愈积极，工作愈起劲。干部觉得战士太好了，以前没有积极分子是自己领导不好。战士们也觉得干部们太好了，有些困难应该体谅。
    找好记好成了风气，确实到处都好起来了。一个半月之中受政治部战斗报表扬的有六百二十八人，平均每天十三人。×团十一天阻击战中没有一个连没有干部受表扬，没有一个连不写表扬稿。至于各连的门板报，每天都出版，表扬的人数多到无法统计。有的连长、管理员、卫生所长自己成了门板报热心的编辑，因为他感到门板报对他自己本身的工作帮助太大，真是个轰轰烈烈的群众性的运动啊！还有一只眼睛闭着的同志，请赶快睁开来看一看。（未完）
