Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st: The large-scale planting of fields in the vast rural areas of Northeast China is nearing completion, and summer hoeing is now underway ahead of schedule. This year's summer hoeing shows four characteristics compared to previous years: First, hoeing began one solar term earlier. Farmers in counties such as Acheng, Shuangcheng, and Hulan in Songjiang Province traditionally followed the practice of "rushing and hurrying, starting shoveling at Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear), sometimes having to rush planting for several days after Mangzhong. This year, due to the increased enthusiasm for production after the land reform and the widespread organization of mutual aid, farmers began weeding before Mangzhong. Second, mutual aid and exchange labor organizations have been further developed during summer hoeing, greatly improving the efficiency of weeding. Hoeing teams in Bin County and Acheng County have generally finished shoveling the weeds in the crops. According to veteran farmers, "The speed of shoveling this year is unprecedented." Third, auxiliary labor has been organized on a large scale to participate in summer hoeing. In Nehe County, Heilongjiang-Nenjiang Province, the number of women participating in hoeing in the fifth district alone reached more than 800. Elementary school students in Liuquan Kaitun, Hulan County, even held hoeing competitions with women. The fourth characteristic is the shift from the past "extensive planting and low yield" to "intensive cultivation." Many areas have put forward the slogan "More hoeing, more tilling, more grain." Each district in Shuangcheng County uses multiple hoeing methods to ensure a one-third increase in grain production. Villages in Hulan County compete in weeding, ensuring "three hoeings and three tillings, consistent tilling and hoeing, and mutual aid throughout the village for more grain." Currently, various regions are summarizing their spring plowing experiences, rewarding model workers, and further promoting the summer hoeing movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st: After a soaking rain on the night of the 13th, farmers in the newly recovered area of Liaoyuan were overjoyed and rushed to plant late-season crops. Due to the uninterrupted conscription of men and laborers during the Chiang occupation, large tracts of farmland were left barren. After the area was recovered last month, local staff actively helped the masses with production, and great achievements have been made in the past 20 days. The cultivated area in the fourth district of Liaoyuan County this year has increased to 16,446 hectares, while it was only 4,787 hectares during the Chiang occupation last year. In addition to the 5,504 hectares that had already been planted before the rain, a vigorous rush planting campaign has been launched after this rainfall.

　　东北开始夏锄
    辽源雨后抢种
    【新华社东北二十一日电】东北广大农村抢种大田已至尾声，现正提早进行夏锄。今年夏锄较之往年表现了四个特点：首先是开锄早一个节气，松江省阿城、双城、呼兰等县农民耕作习惯向为“紧赶慢赶，芒种开铲”，有时芒种后还得抢种数日，今年农民由于翻身后生产热情提高及普遍组织了互助，芒种前即已开始锄草。其次是夏锄中进一步发展了互助换工组织，大大提高了锄草效率。宾县及阿城等县锄地组，已把槎庄稼普遍铲完。据老农谈：“今年铲趟之快为以往任何一年所不及”。第三是辅助劳力被大批组织起来参加夏锄。仅黑嫩省讷河县五区妇女参加锄地的即达八百余人。呼兰县柳泉开屯小学生并向妇女进行锄地竞赛。第四个特点是从过去的“广种薄收”转变到“精耕细作”。许多地区均提出“多铲多趟多打粮”的口号。双城县各区用多锄办法保证增产粮食三分之一。呼兰县各村竞赛锄草，保证“三铲三趟，趟铲一致，全屯互助多打粮食。”目前各地正总结春耕经验，奖励劳模，深入推动夏锄运动。
    【新华社东北二十一日电】新收复区辽源一带，十三日夜获得透雨，农民欢天喜地，抢种晚粮。由于蒋占期间无间断的抓丁抓工，致使广大田地荒芜。该地于上月收复后，地方工作人员即积极帮助群众生产，二十天来，已获巨大成绩。辽源县第四区今年耕地面积已增至一六四四六垧，而去年蒋占时仅仅四七八七垧，除在雨前已种上五五○四垧外，此次雨后，抢种运动已热烈展开。
