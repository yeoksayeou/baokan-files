Expand the New Heroism Movement and Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive

-- Speech by a Leader of the Nenjiang Troops at the Second Congress of Heroes and Models of the Unit --

Half a year has passed since the first Congress of Heroes and Models on December 15th last year. The current situation is that our major counteroffensive is about to arrive. Our army's tasks are more arduous, requiring us to summarize the past and improve further to meet the great new tasks and achieve victory in the major counteroffensive.

This congress is a step forward compared to the previous one. Looking at the development of the New Heroism Movement, the models are more extensive than the first time. The number of heroes and models attending is twice as many as last time. In terms of the movement itself, collective heroism has developed, and more enemy-killing heroes, model groups, model squads and platoons, and model companies have emerged. Since the first Congress of Heroes, progress has been made in all aspects of work. In the past six months, Yangzhuang and Da Xiao Huying annihilated the main force of the 88th Division of the Chiang army and the Second Rapid Column. Our victories are getting bigger and bigger, which shows that our troops have made great improvements in combat style, created many combat techniques, and improved a great deal. It also proves that we are getting stronger and stronger, and it also shows that the creation and leadership of our heroes and models have played a decisive role.

In terms of the leadership method of the mass line, each unit has seen model squads that are exemplary in combat, consolidating the troops, and mass discipline. One model squad captured more than 100 rifles and captured 141 people, including lieutenant generals, in the past six months. Some squads have not had any desertions since the Shangdang Campaign. Some squads are models of mass discipline, battlefield discipline, and unity. In particular, the He Defa squad, because it lost contact with the headquarters due to a business trip, fought alone in the enemy's heavy blockade for half a month, not only without suffering losses, but also returning victoriously. All of the above are the result of the heroes and models uniting the masses and deepening class education in the troops.

Between the two congresses, our unit saw the outstanding model squad - the Shi Yulun squad. It has many characteristics. First of all, it fights well, capturing more than 300 long and short guns, 17 light and heavy machine guns, and 2 mortars in the past six months, and capturing more than 350 prisoners. Secondly, the command and management are good. There have been no desertions in half a year, no casualties in five battles, and mass discipline is also exemplary. In particular, the leadership method and the method of leading troops are good. It is a completely new method of the class mass line. He can mobilize the majority to educate the individual, and he can also use the individual to educate the majority. He can also use people with different backgrounds and different experiences to educate different people. He is good at summarizing experience to educate the masses; especially in combat, he can apply the principle of trying to preserve himself as much as possible under the conditions of resolutely completing the task. We believe that the leadership method of the Shi Yulun squad has been raised to the stage of ideological consciousness. This squad is a typical example and a banner for our army to fight well and lead troops well. Many model figures and model units have also emerged in terms of mass discipline, especially the 8th company of a certain regiment, which is a model company of mass discipline. The company commander and instructor always have a tight grip on the troops, conduct in-depth education, thorough inspection, and clear rewards and punishments. The soldiers consciously proposed to maintain mass discipline. This company has become the best company in our unit in terms of observing discipline and relations between the army and the people.

All of the above are the achievements after we launched the New Heroism Movement. On the eve of the major counteroffensive, we should consolidate and promote these advantages, seek in-depth universality, and expand the New Heroism Movement to win the early arrival of the counteroffensive victory. However, we should never be arrogant and complacent about these achievements. Our New Heroism Movement is not universal and in-depth enough. Many valuable experiences have not been summarized and exchanged in a timely manner, and the spirit of being sensitive and humbly learning from each other is not enough. Secondly, in terms of mass discipline, we must do better in the major counteroffensive in the future. In terms of technology, we are still far from the required level. Some of our commanders lack concrete command methods and organizational skills, and are not very proficient in the coordinated operations of various arms.

The purpose of this Congress of Heroes is to summarize the deeds and experiences of heroes, use the leading and bridging role of heroes to promote existing advantages, overcome existing weaknesses, and make our troops strive for progress in all aspects to meet the glorious task of the major counteroffensive. In order to successfully complete this glorious task, we must do four things: First, all our heroes and models must make ideological preparations for the major counteroffensive, so that all the troops are mobilized in tension. Second, universally carry out the New Heroism Movement, requiring every unit, every department, and commanders and fighters in various positions to be involved in this movement. Third, carry out the Shi Yulun squad movement, make contributions to the people, and make contributions to our unit. Fourth, heroes should pay attention to uniting the masses, and not be arrogant and complacent, and detached from the masses. They must rely on everyone to fight well and do good work, and unite the masses to do it. Heroes must lead everyone to think of ways, everyone to come up with ideas, and gradually achieve that everyone makes contributions and everyone is a hero. In this way, our troops will definitely be built well, we will definitely win greater victories, and we will definitely win the victory of the counteroffensive until we completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous army and end Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule.

　　扩大新英雄主义运动准备大反攻
    ——嫩江部某首长在该部二届英模大会上讲演——
    从去年十二月十五日首次英模大会到今天半年了。目前形势是我们的大反攻行将到来，我们军队任务更加繁重，要求我们总结过去提高一步，迎接伟大的新任务，取得大反攻的胜利。
    此次大会比上届大会是进了一步。就新英雄主义运动发展来看，模范较第一次为广；从出席英模人数来看，比上次多了两倍；就运动本身来看，集体英雄主义发展了，出现了更多的杀敌英雄、模范小组、模范班排和模范连队。第一届群英大会以后，在各方面的工作都进了一步。半年来，杨庄、大小胡营歼灭了蒋军八十八师主力和第二快速纵队。我们的胜利一次比一次大，这说明了我们部队在战斗作风方面有了很大改进，战斗技术有很多创造，也提高了一大步，更证明我们越战越强，也说明了我们英雄模范的创造和带头是起了决定作用的。
    在群众路线的领导方法方面，各部队都出现了在作战、在巩固部队、和群众纪律各方面都称模范的模范班。有个模范班半年来全班缴获步枪一百多支，活捉中将以下一百四十一名。有些班，从上党战役至今未发生逃亡，有些班是群众纪律、战场纪律和团结的模范。特别是何德法班，因出差而与本部失掉联络，在敌人重重封锁中孤军转战前后半月，不仅未受损失，而且胜利归来。上述这些，都是英雄模范在部队中团结群众与阶级教育深入的结果。
    在两届大会之间，我部出现了杰出的模范班——史玉伦班。他的特点很多，首先是仗打得好，半年来缴获长短枪三百多枝，轻重机枪十七挺，迫击炮两门，俘虏三百五十多人。其次是指挥管理好，半年无逃亡，五次战斗无伤亡，群众纪律也是模范。尤其是领导方法带兵方法好，完全是阶级的群众路线的新方法，他能动员大多数教育个别的，也能用个别的去教育大多数，也能运用不同出身与不同经历的人去教育不同的人，他善于总结经验去教育群众；尤其是作战时，能运用在坚决完成任务的条件下，而尽量设法保存自己的原则。我们认为史玉伦班的领导方法已提高到思想自觉阶段，这个班是我军打好仗、带好兵的一个典型、一面旗帜。群众纪律方面也出了不少模范人物和模范单位，特别是某团第八连，是群众纪律的模范连队。连长指导员对部队经常掌握很紧，教育深入，检查彻底，奖惩严明，战士们自觉提出维持群众纪律。这一连队成为我部遵守纪律与军民关系最好的连队。
    以上这些，是我们开展新英雄主义后的成绩，在大反攻的前夜，更应该巩固和发扬这些优点，求得深入普遍，扩大新英雄主义运动，以争取反攻胜利的早日到来。但是我们对这些成绩绝不应骄傲自满，我们在新英雄主义运动方面还不够普遍深入，很多保贵经验没有及时总结交流，对事物的敏感虚心的互相学习的精神还不够。其次在群众纪律方面，今后在大反攻中要作的更好。在技术方面，我们离要求的水准还很远。我们有些指挥员便缺乏具体指挥办法和组织的本领，在各兵种协同作战方面还不很熟练。
    这次群英大会的目的，在于总结英雄事迹及其经验，运用英雄的带头和桥梁作用发扬已有的优点，克服存在的弱点，使我们部队在各方面更力求进步，以迎接大反攻的光荣任务。为了顺利完成这一光荣任务，我们要作好四件事情：第一、我们全体英雄模范在思想上要作好大反攻的思想准备，使全部队紧张动员起来。第二、普遍开展新英雄主义运动，要求每一单位、每一部门、各个不同岗位上的指战员都卷入这个运动。第三、开展史玉伦班运动，为人民立功，为本部队立功。第四、英雄要注意团结群众，不要骄傲自满，脱离群众，打好仗和做好工作都要依靠大家，团结群众来干。英雄要带领大家想办法，大家出主意，要逐渐做到人人立功，个个英雄。这样我们的部队一定能建设好，一定能打更大的胜仗，一定能争取反攻的胜利，直到完全消灭蒋介石的卖国军队，结束蒋介石的独裁统治。（方德  记录）
