　　Forty-Two Villages in Chengci Build Canal to Divert Water
　　Fourty Thousand Mu of Dry Land Become Paddy Fields
　　[Reported from Jinnan, this newspaper, 30th] In the Matou District of Chengci, the construction of canals to divert water has transformed approximately 400 hectares of land into paddy fields. The forty-two villages in this district are situated close to the Fuyang River, with fertile land and a dense population. Irrigated farmland yields two harvests each year, with each harvest producing three to four *shi*, cotton yields 250 *jin*, and wheat yields 2.5 *dou*. Due to eight years of enemy and puppet occupation and plunder, the masses were unable to engage in production, and the canals fell into disrepair. This year, the masses have turned over, and in order to ensure that they and the army have food and clothing, twenty-one villages organized to repair the canals. All men, women, young and old, were mobilized, and the repairs were completed in three days, to the jubilation of the people.
　　[Reported from Jinnan, this newspaper, 30th] The Jize County Committee has instructed the entire county that the current production work should focus on overcoming drought as the central task. In half of the villages that have undergone re-examination, land must be quickly distributed. Villages undergoing re-examination must pause, launch a concentrated effort to sow seeds, and not miss the farming season, leaving the re-examination to be carried out during production intervals. It is emphasized that auxiliary labor and full labor should be organized and concentrated on heavy work, while the elderly, children, and women should do light work. Leaders must make every effort to organize mass production, solve more difficulties, and ensure that wherever the masses are producing, the cadres are there to help. Organize poor and hired peasants to take the lead in summarizing the experiences of middle peasants in becoming rich. During the ten-day intensive period, each person should plant more than 1.5 *mu* of land and ensure that every well is worked day and night, and strive to dig four canals, sink 300 wells, and transplant seedlings on 200,000 *mu*.
　　[Reported from Jinnan, this newspaper, 30th] In the Fourth District of Wuxun, both people and animals were mobilized to successfully complete the rush-plowing and rush-planting. All 13,488 *mu* of uncultivated land have been plowed, and 9,732 *mu* have already been sown. In the district's fifty-nine villages, 3,835 young and middle-aged people, 1,277 cattle, and 178 mules have all joined the mighty current of rush-plowing and rush-planting. Women, the elderly, and children, as semi-laborers, also participated in helping with pulling rollers, standing guard, keeping watch, and doing odd jobs for the families of soldiers. Some people and animals voluntarily formed groups, while others were reorganized from farmers' associations and militia groups into mutual aid teams.

　　成磁四十二村修渠引水
    四万亩旱地成水田
    【本报冀南三十日电】成磁马头区修渠引水，约四百余顷地变为水田。该区四十二个村紧靠滏阳河，土地肥沃，人烟稠密，水地庄稼每年收成两季，每季可收三石至四石，棉花可收二百五十斤，麦子可收二石五斗。由于八年的敌伪盘据掠夺，群众无法生产，水渠失修。今年群众翻了身，为使自己和军队有吃有穿，二十一村组织起来进行修渠，所有男女老少总动员，三天修竣，万民称庆。
    【本报冀南三十日电】鸡泽县委会指示全县，在目前生产工作中以全力克服旱荒为中心之中心，在全县半数经过复查的村庄，土地要赶紧分下去。正进行复查村庄，必须停一停，突击下种，不误农时，留待生产间隙进行，强调组织辅助劳力、全劳力集中用在做重活，老小、妇女做轻活。领导上要用全力组织群众生产，多解决困难，作到群众生产在那里，干部帮助在那里。组织贫雇农带头总结中农发家致富。在十天突击期中，每人要点种一亩半地以上，要作到日夜不闲一眼井，要做到挖渠四道，打井三百眼，安苗二十万亩。
    【本报冀南三十日电】武训四区人畜总动员，胜利完成抢耕抢种，一万三千四百八十八亩白地全部犁完，九千七百三十二亩业已播种。全区五十九个村，青壮年三千八百三十五人，一千二百七十七头牛，一百七十八头骡，均投入抢耕、抢种的巨流中。妇女、老头、儿童等半劳力也参加拉砘子帮忙、站岗、放哨、给抗属做零活。人畜有的自愿结合为小组，有的由农会、自卫队小组改编为互助组。
