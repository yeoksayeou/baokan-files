　　Field Political Department Convenes Civil Affairs Meeting
    Strengthening Mass Work
    [This newspaper's Yubei Front, 22nd dispatch] The Field Political Department convened a meeting of Civil Affairs Section chiefs from various units on June 14 to discuss mass work by the troops during the great counter-offensive. Comrade Zhang Jichun, Deputy Political Commissar, pointed out in his report: Our task in the counter-offensive is not only to eliminate the reactionary troops, but mainly to liberate the people of the whole country, quickly end the rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and establish new liberated areas. Therefore, we must strengthen one of the three major tasks of our army, which is to mobilize the masses, help the masses in land reform, and resolutely oppose purely military viewpoints and ideas that do not take a long-term perspective. Only in this way can we win over the masses, organize the masses, unite the masses, and win political victory. The entire army must make ideological preparations for mobilizing the masses. If we only achieve military victories but fail to mobilize the masses, it will not be considered a complete victory, and we will lose the political significance of fighting. The meeting conducted discussions on the second day, studying the current tasks and how to carry out mass work by the troops, and mobilizing the entire army to speak out to publicize the masses and organize the masses. In addition to conducting a profound review ideologically, clear decisions were made organizationally and practically. Everyone firmly believes that in the new situation and new tasks, mobilizing the masses will surely achieve greater success. (Ying Ting)

　　野政召开民运会议
    加强群众工作
    【本报豫北前线二十二日电】野战政治部于六月十四日召集各部队民运部科长会议，讨论大反攻中的部队民运工作问题，张副政委际春同志报告时指出：我们反攻的任务不但要消灭反动派的军队，主要是解放全国人民，迅速结束蒋介石卖国贼的统治，建立新解放区。因此必须加强我军三大任务之一的发动群众，帮助群众土地改革，坚决反对单纯的军事观点与不从长期着眼的思想。这样才能争取群众、组织群众、团结群众，争取政治上的胜利。全军必须做发动群众的思想准备。如果只在军事上胜利而不能发动群众，也不算完全胜利，就失掉了打仗的政治意义。会议第二日进行讨论，研究当前任务及如何开展部队群众工作，动员全军都张开口宣传群众、组织群众等问题。除在思想上进行了深刻的检讨外，并在组织上工作上作了明确的决定。大家坚信在新的形势及新的任务中，发动群众工作定能作出更大的成绩来。（迎亭）
