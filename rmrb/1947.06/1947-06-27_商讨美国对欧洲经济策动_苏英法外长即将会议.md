Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 25th: Combined reports:

　　The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France will hold a meeting in Paris on the 27th to discuss the American plan to aid European recovery. This stems from a speech given by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall at Harvard University on the 5th, in which he stated that the United States was willing to assist in the development of a unified plan for the overall economic recovery of Europe, to be formulated jointly by European countries themselves. On the 17th and 18th, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault met in Paris to discuss the matter. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson, also visited Molotov on the 17th, stating, "The British government hopes to hear the views of the Soviet government on Marshall's proposal." Molotov replied, "The Soviet government's understanding of this issue is limited to the news already published in the press. Could the British government provide us with more information?" Peterson's reply was negative. Molotov then told him, "Due to insufficient understanding of the situation, the Soviet government has not expressed its opinion on this matter, but still hopes to obtain further materials." On the same day, the Chargé d'affaires of the French Embassy in the Soviet Union, Sapentier, met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik and presented a note stating, "British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault propose to the Soviet government that a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be held in London or Paris on the 23rd of this month to discuss the Marshall Plan." The Soviet government then sent the following reply to the French government on the 22nd: "The Soviet government has read the French government's note of June 19 regarding the preparations for the European Economic Conference related to Mr. Marshall's statement at Harvard University on June 5, which was negotiated bilaterally by the British and French foreign ministers in Paris. The Soviet government agrees that the primary task of European countries at present is to restore and further develop the economy destroyed by the war as soon as possible. It goes without saying that American assistance arranged for the above purpose can facilitate this task. American production has not only not decreased during the war, but has increased. Although the Soviet government is currently unaware of the nature and terms of possible American assistance to European countries, and is unaware of the matters discussed by the French and British governments in the recent Paris negotiations, it is still willing to accept the proposal of the French and British governments to invite the Soviet Union to attend this kind of meeting." On the 23rd, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson and French Chargé d'affaires Sapentier informed Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that the British and French governments had agreed to the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France in Paris on June 27 to discuss the issue of American economic assistance to European countries. On the same day, Bevin also declared in the British House of Commons that Britain had accepted the Soviet proposal. He said that he was pleased with the speed of the Soviet reply and believed that the meeting of the three foreign ministers could achieve results. Members of the British House of Commons cheered this, and Eden also wished Bevin success in the meeting. Bevin is scheduled to leave Britain for France on the 26th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 23rd: Combined reports: British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault held talks in Paris on the 17th and 18th of this month. Bevin has now returned to London. The purpose of this discussion was to discuss how to implement the so-called "European Economic Recovery Plan" carefully formulated by the advocates of American expansionist policies, that is, the notorious "Marshall Plan." At the beginning of the discussions between the British and French governments, they took unilateral action and did not notify the governments of other European countries of their plans. According to the Paris Figaro, the purpose of this discussion between Britain and France is far from to ensure lasting and beneficial peaceful cooperation between large and small European countries, but to attempt to conclude a sales contract behind the backs of the Soviet Union and other European countries.

　　商讨美国对欧洲经济策动
    苏英法外长即将会议
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：苏、英、法三国外长将于二十七日在巴黎举行会议，商讨美国关于援助欧洲复兴之计划。缘美国务卿马歇尔曾于五日在哈佛大学演讲，谈及美国愿意援助由欧洲各国自行联合制定整个欧洲经济复兴之统一计划。十七日、十八日，英外相贝文与法外长比道尔，即于巴黎会商此事。英驻苏大使彼得逊并于十七日往访莫洛托夫称：“英国政府希望听取苏联政府关于马歇尔建议之任何看法”。莫洛托夫答称：“苏联政府对此问题的了解，仅限于报端业已发表之消息，英政府可否告诉我们以更多的情况？”彼得逊的回答是否定的。莫洛托夫乃告诉彼氏：“由于了解情况的不够，苏政府对此问题未作表示意见，但仍盼获得进一步的材料。”同日，法国驻苏大使馆代办萨彭提尔谒见苏外次玛利克，并呈递照会，内称：“英外相贝文与法外长比道尔向苏联政府建议，于本月二十三日在伦敦或巴黎举行英、法、苏三国外长会议，以讨论马歇尔计划。”苏联政府乃于廿二日致法政府如下复文：“法政府六月十九日关于与马歇尔先生六月五日在哈佛大学所作声明有关的英、法两国外长双方曾在巴黎加以谈判的欧洲经济会议筹备事宜的照会，苏联政府业已阅悉。苏联政府同意欧洲各国目前的首要任务，在于尽最快的可能，早日恢复并进一步发展为战争所破坏的经济。美国为上述目的而布置的援助，能使这种任务获得便利，这是不言而喻的事情。美国的生产，在战时不仅远未降低，反而增长。苏联政府目前虽未获悉关于美国对欧洲国家可能援助的性质与条款，且未获悉近日巴黎谈判中法、英两国政府所讨论的事项，但仍愿接受法、英两国政府邀请苏联出席此种会议的建议。”二十三日，英驻苏大使彼得逊及法代办萨彭提尔通知苏外长莫洛托夫，英、法政府已同意苏联的建议，即于六月二十七日在巴黎召开苏联、英国、法国三国外长会议，商讨美国对欧洲国家经济援助问题。同日，贝文亦在英下院宣称：英国接受苏联之建议。并谓苏联答复之速，他引以为快，相信三国外长会议，可获结果。英下院人士对此予以欢呼，艾登亦预祝贝文在会议中能获成功。贝文已定于二十六日离英赴法。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合报导：英外相贝文与法外长比道尔于本月十七、十八两日曾在巴黎举行商谈，贝文顷已返抵伦敦。此次商谈目的，乃在讨论如何实行美国扩张政策倡导者精心制订的所谓“欧洲经济复兴计划”，即臭名远扬的“马歇尔计划”。英、法政府商谈之初，即采取单独行动，并未将彼等之计划通知其他欧洲国家的政府。据巴黎费格罗报观察：英、法此次商谈之目的。远非为了保证欧洲大小国家间持久而有利的和平合作，而是企图背着苏联和其他欧洲国家缔结买卖合同。
