Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Comprehensive report: American imperialism, whose aggressive ambitions exceed those of German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, is eager to implement universal military training. On the 4th of this month, Truman submitted the report of his Universal Military Training Advisory Committee to the U.S. Congress, strongly urging Congress to consider the issue of universal military training in the United States as early as possible. The report suggests that all young men reaching the age of eighteen or having completed secondary education should receive six months of basic military training, and then choose one of the army, navy, or air force for advanced training. This scheme, which violates the freedom of the American people, is unprecedented in American history. Not only will it be opposed by all American people, but some members of Congress also believe that it is impossible to pass any similar military training bill in this Congress.

　　杜鲁门侵略野心勃勃
    亟图实行普遍军训
    将遭到全美国人民反对
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合报导：侵略野心超过德、意、日法西斯的美帝国主义，亟图实行普遍军训。本月四日杜鲁门以其普遍军训顾问委员会之报告书送达美国会，力促国会提早考虑美国普遍军训问题。该报告书中建议凡年届十八岁或已完毕中学教育之壮丁均须受六个月之基本军训，然后再自行在海、陆、空三军中选择其一而受高深训练。此种违反美国人民自由之图谋，为美国历史上空前所未有，不仅将遭到全美国人民反对，即若干国会议员刻亦认为欲在本届国会通过任何类似军训法案，乃不可能的事情。
