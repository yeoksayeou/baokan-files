[Reported by this newspaper from Licheng] Houzhuang's textile heroine, Wang Qiaoze, under the government's call to resist drought, prepare for famine, produce, and conserve, first convened a family meeting on the morning of May 29th. She reviewed the famine of 1943 when they suffered from hunger. Thanks to the district cooperative lending cotton for spinning, they ate bran mixed with vegetables, and even sold their best donkey to survive the famine year. The whole family established a production and conservation plan. Each of the seven family members would save one and a half taels of rice per day. She and her mother-in-law would each spin an extra two taels per day. That same noon, she discussed with the village's textile team leaders and convened a women's meeting for the entire village. At the meeting of 126 women, she talked about the hunger of the 1943 famine, when even bran and vegetables ran out. She borrowed a catty of flour from her neighbor, Li Ruping's, family, and the seven family members ate only two meals. Her mother-in-law continued, "Before the famine, we didn't pay attention to thrift and sold our good donkey. We really suffered during the famine year. If District Cooperative's Lang Fengbiao hadn't lent us cotton to help us spin, we would have starved to death long ago. Adults must be thrifty. If we don't save at the mouth of the jar, we'll end up with nothing at the bottom of the jar!" The self-criticism of the mother and daughter-in-law reminded the women of the whole village, moving several women to tears. Wang Qiaoze said, "In 1943, I survived the famine thanks to spinning. We can't just save; we must also spin more. Only by working hard in both production and conservation can we overcome the famine year." Then, they broke into groups for discussion, each formulating a plan to increase production by the month based on their individual spinning abilities. In total, they could increase spinning by 183 catties. All the women proposed: "We control the cooking pot, and each person saving one and a half taels of rice per day can save more than 1,500 catties for the whole year." Now, women throughout the village have launched a savings and spinning campaign, and everyone is very confident in overcoming the famine year. (Li Ting, Xiang Qin)

[Reported by this newspaper from Ji'nan on the 6th] The women of the entire village of Shengfotang in Wei County held a conference on the 28th of last month. As a result of group discussions, the women and children of the entire village guaranteed that they would not wear blue-green cloth, buy foreign thread handkerchiefs or socks, or use tobacco and alcohol. On the front line of support, they guaranteed that they would not return woven cloth or military shoes, boil water and cook food for passing soldiers, and give preferential treatment to the families of those resisting Japan. To ensure the implementation of these conditions, it was decided that women should make contributions in production and conservation, and work with men in the federation to commend and record merits. Zhang Gengshi and Zhao Kuichun were elected as director and deputy director. Zhang Gengshi immediately announced the organization of a women's agricultural mutual aid group to lead women in agricultural production. Deputy Director Zhao Kuichun planned to personally lead a textile team to promote spinning among women throughout the village and participate in agricultural labor. After the meeting, the women's agricultural team began to weed in the fields, with each person able to weed two mu per day. Bao Mainiang has already weeded four mu, and Zhang Gengshi, Lan Zhongniang, and Geng Chen's wife have all weeded more than two mu. Chen Fuquan's mother, daughter, and daughter-in-law also went to the fields to weed for three days. Early in the morning after the rain, Zhang, Geng Chen's wife, and others took their children to the fields to pull seedlings.
