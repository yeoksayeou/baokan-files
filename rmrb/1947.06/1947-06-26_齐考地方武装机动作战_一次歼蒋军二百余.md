　　Qi-Kao Local Armed Forces Mobile Operations
　　Annihilating Over 200 Chiang Troops in One Action

　　[Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, 23rd] Our local troops in Southwestern Shandong, through offensive actions on exterior lines coordinated with struggles in the heartland, shattered the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations. The Chiang army's 68th Division, 43rd Brigade, mainly consisting of the 429th Regiment, carried out "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations against our Qibin and Kaocheng areas. Our armed forces in this area launched an offensive on exterior lines, and on the 19th of last month, harassed and attacked Zhuangzhai (the location of the enemy brigade headquarters). When the enemy retreated westward to Dazhai on the 20th, one of our units ambushed an enemy company northwest of Weiwan in Gengji. In this battle, 16 enemy personnel, including a political instructor and lower ranks, were captured, and two light machine guns, eight rifles, ammunition, rice, and uniforms, each in one batch, and three carts were seized. We suffered no casualties. Furthermore, on the 27th, two of our detachments entered the areas of Weiwan, Beihanzhuang, and Qiaoxia for activities. The enemy's 429th Regiment moved out from Dazhai at 6:00 AM on the same day and occupied our Weiwan. At 4:00 PM, they launched an attack on our garrison. Our troops immediately counterattacked, and after four hours of fierce fighting, 84 enemy personnel were captured, and over 120 enemy personnel, including battalion and company commanders and lower ranks, were killed or wounded. Two heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, seven grenade launchers, and 35 rifles were seized. In these two battles, our Fifth Military Sub-district's local corps was able to mobilize and concentrate superior forces, giving the enemy annihilating blows, and shattering the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations against our Fifth Military Sub-district. The military region specially issued a commendation order, calling on the troops in each sub-district to learn from them.

　　[Report from this newspaper's correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, 25th] Guerrilla areas in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region have launched a grain protection struggle, and many village cadres and liberated masses have demonstrated a high degree of political consciousness and astonishing tenacity and determination. Liu Wenxiang, a communication员 from Qianzhuangkou Village, Fifth District, Pingyin, was captured by the enemy and subjected to severe torture, forcing him to reveal the location of stored public grain. He was threatened with being buried alive three times, but he clenched his teeth and did not reveal a single word. The enemy ultimately did not obtain a single grain of public grain. When the enemy went to Fuzhuang to rob grain, they captured the village chief's father, an old man over sixty years old, and hung him up and beat him all night. The old man fainted several times, but he never revealed the location of the public grain. Over ten thousand catties of public grain stored in the village suffered no loss. The enemy ordered the villagers of Bozhuang to deliver grain and urged them repeatedly, but the village resolutely refused to deliver it. When the enemy came to the village to rob grain, they seized the mass Wang Xuejin and beat him until his head was broken and bleeding, but he always answered, "I don't know." The enemy grabbed the thirteen-year-old child of the village chief and said, "Bring grain to exchange for the child." The village chief returned and said, "I have three sons; if one dies, there are still two left, but I will not give him grain." Liang Zhenlu, the village chief of Dongtiangong Village, heard that the enemy was coming to the village to rob grain and temporarily avoided leaving the village. Later, he learned that a special agent in the village had reported the location of the hidden grain to the enemy. He rushed back overnight and transferred and distributed the public grain. The next day, the enemy dug for grain, but found nothing. Yang Xingchang, director of the Shaoji Farmers' Association in the Second District of Fanxian, was transporting public grain from the east bank to the west bank of the river one night. His back was wounded by the enemy, but he still desperately rowed the boat and ordered the sailors, "Even if we die, we cannot bring the boat back." Finally, amidst a hail of bullets, he reached the west bank. All the public grain was successfully preserved.

　　齐考地方武装机动作战
    一次歼蒋军二百余
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】鲁西南我地方部队以外线出击配合腹地斗争，粉碎敌人第五次“清剿”“扫荡”。蒋军六八师四三旅以四二九团为主，对我齐滨、考城地区实行“清剿扫荡”。我该区武装外线出击，于上月十九日扰袭庄砦（敌旅部所在地），敌于二十日西撤大砦时，我某部于魏湾西北耿集伏击敌一个连，此役计俘敌指导员以下十六名，缴轻机枪两挺，步枪八支，子弹、大米、单衣各一部，大车三辆。我无伤亡。又二十七日，我某部两大队进入魏湾、北韩庄、桥下一带活动，敌四二九团于当日早六时由大砦出动进占我魏湾，十六时向我驻地进攻，我军当即予敌反击，激战四小时，俘敌八十四名，毙伤敌营连长以下一百二十余名，缴获重机枪二挺，轻机枪三挺，掷弹筒七个，步枪三十五支。此两次战斗，我五分区地方兵团能机动集中优势兵力，给敌以歼灭性的打击，粉碎敌人对我五分区之第五次“清剿扫荡”，军区特通令表扬，号召各分区部队向其学习。
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】冀鲁豫边缘区游击区展开护粮斗争，许多村干部与翻身群众表现了高度的政治觉悟与惊人的顽强坚定。平阴五区前庄科村通信员刘文祥被敌捕去，严刑拷问，逼其说出存公粮地点，三次以活埋威胁，他咬紧牙关不露一字，敌人终未弄出一粒公粮。敌人到傅庄抢粮时，将村长的父亲、一个六十多岁的老头捉去，整夜吊打，老汉昏死几次，始终不说公粮所在，该庄所存万余斤公粮，丝毫未受损失。敌人命令薄庄村民送粮，催促多次，该村坚决不送。敌人到村抢粮，抓住群众王学金，把他打得头破血流，始终答以“不知道”。敌人把该村村长十三岁的孩子抓去说：“拿粮食来换孩子”，村长回来表示：“我三个儿，死一个还有两个，就是不给他粮食。”东天宫村村长梁贞禄闻敌人来村抢粮，暂时避出村外，后获知村里特务将藏粮地点报告了敌人，他星夜赶回把公粮转移分存。第二天敌人挖粮，毫无所获。范县二区邵集农会主任杨兴长，于一天夜间由河东往河西运公粮，背部被敌打伤，仍拚命划船，并命令水手：“打死也不能将船靠回去。”终于在弹雨中＠抵西岸。公粮得以全部保存。
