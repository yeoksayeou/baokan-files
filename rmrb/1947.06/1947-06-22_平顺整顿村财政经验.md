Experience in Straightening Out Village Finances in Pingshun
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Lin Hua　Zhuo Min

　　The work of straightening out village political and financial affairs in Pingshun began on May 15th and ended at the end of June. Great achievements were made in half a month. The main experiences are summarized as follows:

　　The first step is to break down ideological obstacles and start with the rectification of village public property. Regardless of cadres or the masses, there are many confused ideas and various thoughts: One is the idea of "there is nothing." The political director of Chouishui in the sixth district said at the beginning of the rectification: There is nothing to rectify in a small village, but in fact, after the rectification, the value of the disposal was about 300,000 yuan. Some cadres also wanted to lie in ambush and were unwilling to rectify, using the excuse of "mass opposition." Another more common idea is: feudal backward superstitious thinking; unwilling to sell or dismantle ancestral halls or temples, thinking that these things can be used as geomantic omens to ward off evil spirits, but they are not willing to say it directly. For example, there is a God of Wealth temple in Dongwumali, and the cadres said: "We dare not sell it, let's keep it to block the water! A martyrs' pavilion can also be built on the temple platform." When Dongchan was selling the ancestral hall, some old people said: "If you mess with it again, even the family will not recognize each other, and they will not know who the ancestors are. If future generations know about you, they will be afraid to scold you as a prodigal son!" In addition, there is also a fear of requisition, such as the cadres of Heihu saying: "This is not to rectify village administration, this is to register it so the county government knows how many trees we have. If they are needed when building the county government, they will come to requisition them."

　　To eliminate these ideological concerns, various villages have taken the following measures: 1. Calculate the burden: Heihu Village calculated that the annual expenditure needs 19 *shi* of rice, which is almost equal to the border grain and border funds. If the public property is turned into active property, not only can the expenditure of 19 *shi* of rice be saved, but also the funds for making military shoes and other grain can be solved. Therefore, the masses' thinking was straightened out, and the public property worth about 327,000 yuan was put into production. Besides the expenditure, there was still a surplus. 2. Anti-superstition education should be universally carried out among the peasants. For example, an old man in Beishe said: "They have become tools of feudal rule. The ancestral hall does not exploit people." So the cadres asked him to recall the past, why the ancestral hall fined him sixty *jin* of steamed buns every year. He quickly understood from his own experience, so he also hated the ancestral hall. 3. For villages that are afraid of requisitioning public property, a guarantee is given that it will never be used.

　　The second step is to pay attention to bringing into play the strength of various people and create a mass upsurge of rectifying public property. The methods are mainly: 1. Train activists, form a core, and create a mass upsurge. For example, Wangqu first straightened out the thinking among the cadres, and then organized a group of activists in production and emancipation to go to the masses to discover and solve problems. In this way, public opinion was created in a short period of time, so that the village's financial cleanup work could be carried out quickly, and the results were good. The total value of public property rectified is about one million yuan or more. 2. Convene meetings of figures from the old society and old people, and conduct multi-faceted visits. They will tell us a lot of information, such as the old society's *sheshou*, village, *lü* head, school director, etc. After a meeting of old people was convened in Honglingshang, two *she*'s opera boxes were clarified. At first, the two *she*s argued with each other. Later, after the old people proved that they were indeed from the Long family, the other *she* had no objection. 3. Combine with solving the problem of fruit leftovers: For example, Dongchan found the problem of fruit during the cleanup of village finances, and made appropriate handling, so the masses were calm and more enthusiastic about the rectification of public property. 4. Carry out the movement of establishing meritorious models. One of the standards for establishing merit mentioned in the seventh district is: Villages with no public property, if they can achieve self-sufficiency in village finances, all cadres will make great contributions. Under this call, the cadres and masses of Ganhua Village discussed and decided on the spot to use transportation and weaving to solve the problem, with each male laborer completing 600 yuan and each woman completing 300 yuan.

　　平顺整顿村财政经验
    林华　卓民
    平顺整顿村政财工作，从五月十五日开始，到六月底即结束，半个月内作出很大成绩，兹总结其主要经验如下：
    第一步是打破思想障碍，整顿村公产开始，无论干部群众都有许多糊涂观念和各色各样的想法：一种是：“没有甚”思想，六区臭水＠政治主任在开始整顿时就说：村小没有什么可整顿，但实际上经整顿后，变价约值三十万元。还有的干部借口“群众反对”想打埋伏不愿整。另一种较为普遍的是：封建的落后迷信思想；不愿意把祠堂或庙卖掉，或拆掉，认为这些东西可以当风脉挡煞气，但是并不愿意直接说出来，如东五马里有个财神庙，干部说：“可不敢卖，留着挡水吧！庙台上也能修个烈士亭。”东禅在卖祠堂时，有些老人说：“再弄弄得连一家人也认不得了，也不知道祖宗是谁，后人知道了你，怕不骂你是败家鬼！”此外还有一种是怕调用，如黑虎干部说：“这不是整顿村政哩，这是登记起来，县政府知道咱有多少树，如修县政府时来调用。”
    解除这些思想顾虑各村采取了以下办法：一、计算负担：黑虎村计算了一下，全年需开支十九石米，差不多抵住边粮边款了，如果把公产变成活产，不仅可省去十九石米的开支，而且做军鞋及其他粮款也能解决，于是群众的思想弄通了，全村公产变价约值三十二万七千余元投入生产，除开支还有剩余。二、在农民中间应普遍进行反迷信教育，如北社一个老汉说：“都成了封建统治工具啦，祠堂又不剥削人。”于是干部就叫他回忆以前，每年祠堂罚他蒸六十斤面的馍是为啥哩，他从切身体验中很快的想通了，于是对祠堂也仇恨起来了。三、对怕调用公产的村子提出保证，绝不动用。
    第二步是要注意发挥各种人物的力量，造成群众性整顿公产的热潮，方法上主要是：一、训练积极分子，组成核心，造成群众性的热潮。如王曲开始在干部中打通思想，接着组织了一批生产和翻身中的积极分子到群众中去发现问题和解决问题，这样在短短的时间内就造成舆论，因此使该村清理财政工作能迅速的开展起来，而且成绩不错，整顿出来的公产总值约在百万元以上。二、召开旧社会的人物及老年人会议，进行多方面的访问，他们会告诉我们好多材料，如旧社会的社首，村、闾长、学董等。在洪岭上召开了老年人会议后，曾弄清楚了两个社的戏箱，开始两社互争，后经老人们证明，确系龙姓，因此另一社无意见了。三、结合解决果实遗留问题：如东禅在清理村财政中发现果实问题，便作了适当的处理，因此，群众都心平气和了，而且对公产整顿更积极热情起来。四、开展立功表模运动。七区提的立功标准中即有一条是：毫无公产村庄，如能做到村财政自给，全体干部立大功。在这样号召下，甘化村的干部和群众讨论，当场议决用运输和纺织来解决，每个男劳力完成六百元，每个妇女完成三百元。
