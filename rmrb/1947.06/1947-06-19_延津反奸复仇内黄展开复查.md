　　【Our Newspaper, JiluYu, 16th dispatch】Yanjin's newly recovered areas are vigorously carrying out revenge and reversing the land redistribution. During the enemy occupation in Xue Dian Village, Seventh District, the evil landlord Xue Youheng exploited the masses, reversed the return of 50 mu of land and 18 *shi* of grain to the peasants, and forced the peasants to host banquets and give gifts, plotting to murder the village farmers' association director but failing. After Yanjin was liberated, our work team arrived in the village and immediately arrested Xue Youheng, convened a mass meeting of the entire village. At the meeting, the peasants angrily complained and unanimously demanded revenge. 106.5 mu of land of Xue Youheng was immediately confiscated and distributed to poor peasants. After the meeting, the masses' emotions were high and they enthusiastically investigated property. In Youfang Village, Fifth District, the evil landlord Feng Yitang and three others reversed the distribution of 300 *shi* of grain and more than 60 mu of land, and colluded with the "Homecoming Corps" to destroy the village's peasant organizations, killing the entire family of activist Ma Xuedao, and two of the four members of Liu Chunshan's family were killed! Our guerrillas once entered the village to suppress them, but when the guerrillas withdrew, landlords like Feng Yitang killed the entire family of activist Liu Chunshan! After this recovery, our Fifth District government moved into the village, and the masses of the entire village unanimously demanded revenge, so Feng Shantang's father was executed to pay for his son's crimes, and all the reversed property was recovered. A thorough investigation of property and land is now underway. The Second District is a marginal area closest to the enemy, and the enemy harasses it from time to time. Evil landlords secretly collude with stubborn elements, and the masses dare not act. Our democratic government arrested and centrally controlled the worst offenders, and held landlord meetings and peasant meetings in each village to explain government decrees and universally control landlords. Seeing that the government was resolutely supporting them, the masses moved away the stones, and thus began a vigorous investigation of property and land. In fifteen days, the masses in the entire district recovered a total of 420 mu of land, as well as a great deal of grain, livestock, farm implements, and clothing. At present, the movement for revenge, reversal of land redistribution, and investigation of land and property is still being carried out enthusiastically in various villages throughout the county.
    【Our Newspaper, JiluYu, 16th dispatch】Neihuang's newly recovered areas have shifted from revenge and grievance to re-examination. On the 23rd of last month, the First and Second Districts held peasant conferences of 3,000 and 6,000 people respectively. On display at the meeting were the silks, furs, pearls, and silver bracelets of the local tyrant landlord Wei Liuhe. After the conferences were held to air grievances, each sub-district immediately selected fifteen poor peasant representatives to form a conference headquarters, which became the temporary supreme power organ of the peasants. The large landlord of Gaozhuang, Zhang Ziying, had been struggled against several times without producing anything of his. This time, six packages of his belongings, as well as pure cotton, silver dollars, and copper coins were extracted at the meeting. He also revealed that he had connections with the Zhangde "Homecoming Corps" and that there was a pistol in the waterway. These facts made the cadres and the masses realize the landlords' feigned poverty and overcome the cadres' and masses' "almost" mentality. Everyone vowed to resolutely and thoroughly settle accounts and deal with crimes accordingly. Three major guarantees were proposed to the middle peasants: "First, no struggle; second, can participate in the farmers' association; and third, can also be given a share of the fruits in moderation." The fruits are distributed as they are seized, leaving no loose ends. In action, organize and strengthen the organization and develop the militia.

　　延津反奸复仇内黄展开复查
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】延津新收复区逢勃开展复仇反倒算。七区薛店村在沦陷期间，坏蛋地主薛有恒压榨群众倒回农民土地五十亩，粮食十八石，并逼迫农民请宴送礼，图谋杀害村农会主任未遂。延津解放后，我工作组到达该村，当即将薛有恒逮捕，召开全村群众大会，会上农民愤恨申冤，一致要求复仇，当即没收薛有恒一百○六亩五分土地，分给贫农。会后，群众情绪高涨热烈查财。五区油房村坏蛋地主冯义堂等四人，将斗出之粮食三百石，地六十余亩，全部倒回，并勾搭“还乡团”摧残村内农民组织，将积极分子马学道全家杀光，刘春山家四人被杀二口！我游击队曾一度进村镇压，但当游击队撤出后，冯义堂等地主又将积极分子刘春山全家杀绝！此次收复后，我五区政府进住该村，全村群众一致要求复仇，遂将冯善堂之父偿命，并收回所有被倒去之财物，现正热烈进行查财、查地。二区是离敌最近的边缘区，敌人不时出扰，坏蛋地主暗中勾搭顽杂，群众不敢动，我民主政府乃将最坏者逮捕集中管制，并分别在各村召开地主会农民会，说明政府法令，普遍控制地主。群众见政府坚决撑腰，搬去石头，于是轰轰烈烈起来查财、查地，十五天中，全区群众共收回土地四百二十亩、及粮食、牲口、农具、衣服等甚多。目前全县各村复仇反倒算查地、查财运动仍在热烈开展中。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】内黄新收复区由复仇诉苦转入复查。上月二十三日，一、二区分别召开了三千和六千人的农民大会，会场上展览着恶霸地主魏流合的绸缎、皮袄、珍珠、银镯子等。大会进行诉苦后，各小区当场选出十五个贫农代表，组成大会指挥部，成为农民的临时最高权力机关。高庄大地主张子英，斗争他几次了没弄出他的东西，这次在会上追出他包袱六个及净花、银元、铜子等，他并说出与彰德“还乡团”有联系，水道里有手枪一支。这些事实使干部和群众认识了地主的假装苦穷，克服了干部群众“差不多”思想。大家宣誓要坚决彻底清算，按罪处理。对中农提出三大保证“一不斗争，二可参加农会，三还可酌量分到果实”。果实随斗随分，不留一点尾巴。在行动中整理加强组织，发展民兵。
