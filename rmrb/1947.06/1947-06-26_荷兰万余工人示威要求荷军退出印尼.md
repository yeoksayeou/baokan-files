　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th—According to TASS, The Hague: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, in view of the increasingly tense relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia, recently issued a declaration stating: "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Netherlands expresses satisfaction with the reply drafted by the government of the Republic of Indonesia in the spirit of striving for peace and cooperating with the Dutch people. This reply resolutely defends the democratic government and rights of the Indonesian people in order to achieve Indonesian independence, resisting the open or concealed schemes of the colonialists. Now, all freedom-loving and democratic forces in the Netherlands need a high degree of vigilance and action, and must not allow the reactionaries to lead our country into disaster." The "Dutch-Indonesian League," composed of many democratic groups nationwide, sent a letter to the Dutch Council of Ministers, demanding an end to military pressure on the Republic of Indonesia and the realization of peaceful cooperation.
