A synthesis of the main leadership experiences during this period: First, the leadership grasped the basic demands of the masses and mobilized them. For example, before May 18th, the whole county grasped the masses' demand for grain and implemented relief, which changed the masses' skeptical attitude of not daring to approach us. At the district chief and branch secretary meeting on May 18th, it was analyzed that the masses' demands were for wheat and land. Each district seized this demand, and the county immediately launched a large-scale anti-traitor liquidation and wheat and land distribution movement. The masses received wheat, and then complained and demanded further liquidation, raising higher demands. At present, the active elements emerging from each village are produced in the process of realizing their own demands. Each village has a group of leadership groups, organized self-defense forces and farmers' associations, and the masses have strength and are bolder.

Secondly, in the action of realizing the demands of the masses, the leadership should consciously promote the positive aspects of the masses (such as daring to complain, dare to fight, and dare to ask for things), give play to fighting spirit, stimulate action, and combine action with education. For example, in Quzhuang, in the anti-traitor wheat distribution, the masses were allowed to discuss where the land of the traitors and landlords came from? Whose wheat are we dividing? The masses understood that it was the land they had seized and the blood and sweat they had exploited, and they immediately started to do it with confidence.

Thirdly, regarding leadership methods and work style: The experience of Xingji Small District in the Fifth District is to adopt the method of mobilizing piece by piece. They held a joint meeting of base points, and after relief, they discovered more than 20 active elements. Through them, they quickly launched the liquidation and wheat distribution movement. More than 60 active elements emerged during the movement. The Zhangbao Small District adopted the method of lighting fires in every village and all of them smoking at the same time. The movement developed rapidly. The method was to go deep into the basic-level poor and hired peasants as soon as they entered the village, solve the problems as soon as they were discovered, and immediately discover the active elements. They quickly handed over the wheat and land distribution to the active elements, and then transferred themselves to another village to light the fire.

### 满足群众要求发扬积极因素

　　满足群众要求发扬积极因素
    综合这一时期的主要领导经验：首先是领导上抓住群众基本要求，把群众发动起来。如五月十八日前，全县抓住了群众要粮的要求，实行了救济，改变了群众不敢接近我们的怀疑态度。五月十八日区长、分书会议上分析了群众的要求是要麦要田，各区抓紧这要求，全县马上展开了反奸清算，分麦分田大运动，群众得到麦子，接着就诉苦要求进一步清算提出了更高的要求。目前各村产生的积极层，都是在实现自己要求中产生出来的。村村有了一伙伙的领导集团，组织了自卫队农会，群众有了力量，胆也更壮了。
    其次，在实现群众要求的行动中，领导上要有意识发扬群众的积极面，（如敢诉敢斗敢要东西等），发挥斗志、激发行动、结合行动，进行教育。如蘧庄在反奸分麦中，让群众讨论汉奸地主的土地是那里来的？咱们分的麦是谁的？群众了解了是霸占自己的土地，是剥削自己的血汗，便马上理直气壮的干起来了。
    再次，关于领导方法与作风问题：五区刑剂小区经验，是采取一片片发动的方法，他们召开了基点联合大会，经救济后即发现了二十多个积极分子，通过他们很快的展开了清算分麦运动。运动中又涌现出六十多个积极分子。漳保小区采取了村村点火一齐冒烟的办法，运动发展很快，方法是一进村就深入基本层贫雇农中去，发现问题就解决，马上就发现积极分子，他们就把分麦分田的事情，很快交给积极分子来办，自己再转到另一村点火。
