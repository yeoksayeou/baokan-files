　　Taihang "Matun" Unit's Two-Decade Wheat Protection Achievements
    Annihilated More Than 200 Including Puppet County Magistrate
    Helped Harvest 2,900 Mu of Wheat
    [Reported by this newspaper] From May 16th to June 5th, the Taihang "Matun" troops, after twenty days of intense combat and the bloodshed and sweat of all commanders and fighters, achieved the following results:
    1. Engaged in eleven battles of varying sizes, capturing alive 32 members of the stubborn puppet regime, including township head Mao Jiachen, wounding puppet county magistrate Li Deji (Qinyang), and killing 171 members of the puppet forces including puppet captains Tong Zijun (Bo'ai), Wang Hengchuan (Jiaozuo), and Yao Yuankui (Qinyang). Seized one heavy machine gun, 37 rifles and carbines, two Mauser pistols, 1,600 rounds of various bullets, 19 livestock, one mimeograph machine, one telephone, and five bicycles. The enemy-to-own casualties ratio was seven to one.
    2. Protected the summer harvest and assisted in the summer harvest, primarily in Bo'ai, extending to Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi, covering an area of approximately 3,325 square li. Helped harvest 2,900 mu of wheat, with the 4th Detachment contributing the most, 587 mu, followed by the 1st Detachment with 535 mu, and the 2nd Detachment with 434 mu. On average, each person harvested 3.23 mu of wheat. Carried 4,949 loads of water, with the 7th Detachment contributing the most, 1,583 loads, followed by the 4th Detachment with 1,480 loads. Other labor such as transporting wheat to the threshing ground, spreading it, threshing, and winnowing amounted to a total of 2,502 workdays. If calculated at the local wage of one dou of wheat per workday, this is equivalent to 250.2 shi of wheat. If this batch of grain were used to relieve disaster victims, allocating 3.6 shi per person per year, it could save 69.5 people. Only the People's Army would increase the people's income, reduce expenses, and lighten their burden in this way. The masses of Bo'ai said, "We never expected this year's wheat to be harvested so quickly and safely!" "If you hadn't come, we would have watched the wheat go uneaten! We've had some comfortable days these past few days, and finally breathed a sigh of relief!"
    3. Political offensive: Everyone propagandizes, propagandizes to everyone; wherever we go, we propagandize there. Yangko teams approached the east gate of Bo'ai, and slogans were written all over the walls of the villages where we were stationed. As the people say, "When the Eighth Route Army comes, people live, everything changes!" We wrote more than 2,000 slogans, erased 82 stubborn puppet slogans, and publicized condolences to military families and families of martyrs to more than 23,000 people.
    Not a single stalk of wheat was snatched away by the stubborn puppets from the planned protection area; the wheat fields that had been "counted backward" were returned to their original owners. The masses in the border area (east and west Jincheng) initially dared not harvest, but after our propaganda and organization, and emboldened by our support, the masses colluded and collectively harvested, some during the day and some at night, and everyone shared. Some troops harvested and distributed to the poor.
    Our army's active actions forced the stubborn puppets of Bo'ai to dare not leave the city for five li, eating corn porridge or boiled wheat every day. The treacherous bullies and landlords who fled to the city were even more anxious that they could not loot a single grain of the half-year's wheat, and repeatedly asked the stubborn county government for cover to plunder.
    On June 1st, the stubborn county magistrate convened a meeting of "township heads" around the city, and angrily decided, "Burn from afar, rob from nearby, eat what's on hand." He ordered each person to prepare a pocket. But on the 9th, more than 200 enemies robbed more than 300 jin in Xiyangyi while our main force was transferring, but it was all intercepted by us. Currently, all our comrades are sharpening their knives and wiping their guns, preparing to welcome the upcoming grain protection struggle. (Cui Dianchen)

　　太行“马屯”部两旬保麦战绩
    歼伪县长以下二百余
    助收麦子二千九百亩
    【本报讯】太行“马屯”部队自五月十六日至六月五日经过二十天的辗转紧张战斗和全体指战员同志的流血流汗，获得了如下成绩：
    一、作战大小十一次，生俘顽伪乡长毛嘉臣以下三十二名，伤伪县长李德基（沁阳）、毙伪队长童子俊（博爱）、王恒川（焦作）姚元奎（沁阳）以下一百七十一人。缴获重机枪一挺，步马枪三十七支，驳壳枪二支，各种子弹一千六百发，牲口十九匹，油印机一部，电话机一部，自行车五辆。敌我伤亡为七比一。
    二、保卫夏收及帮助夏收，地区以博爱为主，遍及焦作、修武、武陟，面积约为三千三百二十五平方里。助收麦子二千九百亩，以四支队为最多，五百八十七亩，一支队五百三十五亩，二支队四百三十四亩次之。平均每人割麦三·二三亩。担水四千九百四十九担，以七支队为最多，一千五百八十三担。四支队一千四百八十担次之。其他劳作如运麦泼场、撒场、打场、扬场等在内，总计折工二千五百零二个。若以当地工资麦子一斗计，折麦子二五○·二石。若将这批粮食用作救济灾难民，每人每年按三·六石分配，即可救六九·五个人。只有人民军队才会这样为人民增加收入，减少开支，减轻负担。博爱群众说：“全没想到今年的麦子会安安然然的很快收完！”“你们不来，俺又是眼看麦子没吃的！俺这几天才过了痛快日子，爽快的出了口气！”
    三、政治攻势：人人宣传，见人宣传；走到那里，宣传到那里。秧歌队逼近了博爱东关，标语写满了驻村的墙壁。正如老百姓说：八路军一来，人活了，一切都变了！我们共写标语二千余条，擦顽伪标语八十二条，宣传群众慰问军属烈属共两万三千余人。
    原预定的保卫区的麦子，顽伪未抢去一根；被“倒算”的麦田，仍归原主。边地（东西金城）群众开始不敢收，但经我们宣传组织，撑腰壮胆，群众串通后，有的白天、有的黑夜集体抢收，大家伙分了。有的军队割倒分给穷苦群众。
    我军的积极活动，逼得博爱的顽伪不敢出城五里，每天一顿玉茭糊，或煮吃麦子。逃居城内的奸霸地主更为焦急，期待半年的麦子抢不到颗粒，纷纷向顽县府要求掩护抢掠。
    六月一日顽县长召开城周“乡保长”会议，老羞成怒的决定：“远烧近抢吃现成。”叫每人准备一条口袋。但九日敌二百余，趁我主力转移，到西杨邑抢了三百多斤，又被我全部截获。现我全体同志正磨刀擦枪，准备迎接即将到来的护粮斗争。（崔殿宸）
