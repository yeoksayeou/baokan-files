　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 7th (Delayed Dispatch): The Jiang army's 32nd Division, 3rd Division, part of the 66th Division (partially annihilated in mid-April), 64th Brigade of the Reorganized 15th Division, and some local troops, which had invaded Qi County from both sides of the Pinghan Railway, fled in panic on the 1st when our People's Liberation Army rushed to encircle and annihilate them. We then recaptured Qi County and are continuing to pursue the defeated enemy. The enemy launched its northern advance from Xin County on the 15th of last month, mostly spending the first day searching, and then advancing at a snail's pace on the second day. Along the way, they were constantly ambushed, attacked, and blocked by our local armed forces. From May 15th to June 1st, they only advanced about 70 *li* in 16 days, averaging just over 4 *li* per day. As soon as they detected the presence of the People's Liberation Army in front of them, they immediately fled at double speed.
    
　　Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shanxi Front, 11th: The Yan's remnant county government of Fencheng and more than 700 people from the "Property Protection Brigade" and "Special Service Detachment" who abandoned the city and fled north have been mostly annihilated or dispersed in the past few days under the pursuit and suppression of our local armed forces. This group, led by Liu Zhenduo, the county head of Fencheng under Yan's regime, and a Hao, the former deputy head of the "Love Hometown Corps," fled to Xiangling City on the 31st of last month, only to be refused entry by the Chiang-Hu troops entrenched in the city. On the night of the 3rd, while attempting to cross the Fen River eastward, they were severely attacked by a unit of the People's Liberation Army. Most of the soldiers abandoned their weapons and took the opportunity to escape home. Liu Zhenduo fled towards Linfen with only three guards. The remaining 200 or so men led by Hao are scattered between Xiangling and Fencheng, and the People's Liberation Army is searching for them. Furthermore, Yan's henchmen, personnel from the reactionary district and township governments, and armed forces have been captured one after another. Hidden reactionary and puppet personnel have recently been entering the city to register with the democratic government to repent and start anew. According to the person in charge of the reactionary and puppet personnel registration office, 62 people have registered to start anew in the past six days, including Zheng Fuhe, a construction committee member of the "Political Defense Second Division" of the Yan army, and other civil and military officers at the school level.
