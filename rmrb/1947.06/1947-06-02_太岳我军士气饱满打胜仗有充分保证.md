　　【This Dispatch from Taiyue, May 29th】"Meeting Commander Chen Geng is like seeing victory." This was the first impression of Comrade Cui Douchen of the Taiyue District Victory Celebration and慰问团 after arriving at the front. Comrade Cui Douchen told reporters, "Seeing the avalanche of victory reports in the rear, I often pondered how these great victories were achieved. After meeting Commander Chen Geng, I fully understood that his calm and brilliant command guaranteed the victory of the war." Comrade Cui Douchen specifically mentioned that "from Commander Chen Geng's resolute, joyful demeanor filled with victorious belief, we believe that the great counter-offensive will arrive quickly." He also said that while慰问ing a certain brigade, he got the same impression from the brigade commander. He said, "We trust these commanders and will definitely win." From the soldiers, Comrade Cui Douchen saw another guarantee of victory: "The combination of wisdom and courage is not only present in the commanders, but also in every soldier. And among the soldiers, there are two pleasing phenomena: one is winning without arrogance, and the other is full morale." Comrade Cui Douchen said, "Although they have achieved great victories, they are not arrogant at all, and they still humbly practice, holding Zhuge Liang meetings. Although they have been running around and fighting for more than a month, they are full of morale and high spirits." The慰问团 is now深入ing various companies to collect typical materials, preparing to take them back to the rear as teaching materials for the rear to study.

　　太岳我军士气饱满打胜仗有充分保证
    【本报太岳二十九日电】“会见了陈赓司令员，就像见到了胜利”。这是太岳区祝捷慰问团崔斗辰同志来前线后第一个印象。崔斗辰同志对记者说：“在后方看到雪片飞来的捷报，曾使我频频苦思这些伟大胜利是如何获得的，这次会见了陈赓司令员，我才完全明白了，他的沉着英明的指挥，保证了战争的胜利”。崔斗辰同志特别提到“从陈赓司令员的坚决愉快充满了胜利信念的仪表中，使我们相信大反攻迅速到来”。他又说到在慰问某旅时，也从某旅长身上得到同样印象。他说：“我们信赖这些指挥员，一定胜利”。从战士那里，崔斗辰同志又看到胜利的另一个保证：“智勇结合不仅在指挥人员，而且在每个战士身上也同样洋溢着这种品质。并且在战士中间，有值得欢喜的两种好现象，一是胜而不骄，一是士气饱满”。崔斗辰同志说：“他们虽然获得了巨大胜利，但毫不骄傲，仍旧虚心的练兵，开诸葛亮会议。他们虽然东奔西跑打了一个多月仗，但士气饱满，精神焕发”。现慰问团正深入各连队收集典型材料，准备带回后方去，作为后方学习的教材。
