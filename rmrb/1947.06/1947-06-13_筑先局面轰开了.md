　　The situation in Zhuxian is thoroughly broken open
    Guo Shaoying, recorded by Zhang Su

    Zhuxian County (Liaocheng) is an example of relatively rapid progress in the land reform movement in the Sixth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. As soon as the movement started, "fires were lit in every village, smoke rose everywhere." In one month, the situation was thoroughly broken open. More than 300 landlords were struggled against, and 100,000 farmers (out of a county population of 300,000) received training and benefits. More than 10,000 people were selected as People's Heroes, of which more than 500 were promoted to cadres. About 5,000 young and strong farmers went to the front line, and about 5,000 were admitted to the Communist Party. The struggle was magnificent and large-scale, characterized by fighting while distributing land (farmers reclaimed some land, but materials are lacking at the moment), and the process was as follows:

    Moving Stones

    Although the farmers in the newly recovered areas eagerly awaited the distribution of land and grain, they were afraid of the bloody rule of the landlords who had been weighing on their heads for thousands of years. Furthermore, they did not understand the policies of the Communist Party. Therefore, when they saw our staff, they were warm in their hearts (wanting land) but cold on the surface (afraid of landlords). The leaders of Zhuxian County deeply understood the people's suffering and resolutely carried out the farmers' demand to "move stones." A large number of cadres went to the countryside, and government announcements and slogans such as "revenge for grudges, redress grievances" were posted in all the large and small villages of the county within three days: evil bullies and landlords are criminals, and farmers' land distribution is legal. Each district arrested two to three hundred landlords, and more than 2,000 "stones" were moved in the whole county. The landlords were frightened, the farmers were elated, and the social atmosphere changed!

    The Farmers' Congress Takes Precedence Over Everything

    Each district convened a farmers' congress. Five thousand, eight thousand, ten thousand farmers came to the congress with unprecedented hope to "register the bottom line" (see the policy of the Communist Party). On the first day of the congress, the democratic government executed one or two of the most heinous evil bullies and landlords in the district, and performed operas, Yangko dances, and stilt walks, which excited the masses. Cadres went deep into the masses to brew grievances. On the second day, it was announced that all puppet Bao chiefs and township chiefs would be dismissed, and the worst ones would be detained. A dozen or twenty activists first poured out their sufferings at the meeting, using suffering to elicit suffering. The whole audience asked to pour out their sufferings, so they were divided into small groups to universally recount their grievances. Anyone who could not pour out their sufferings must have had henchmen, and at that time, the henchmen were immediately brought out to form a henchman training class. With thousands of grudges and sufferings, the masses were filled with indignation and unanimously demanded revenge and hatred, and the overthrow of landlords. On the third day, the small group meetings formulated revenge plans. The masses proposed "to strike the head first when hitting a tiger," and "there is firewood to burn when a big tree is cut down." Each district stipulated five or six large landlords to be struggled against. After being approved at the congress, a temporary action representative meeting was elected on the spot to organize the picket team, the tree-cutting team (the district was extremely short of firewood, and cutting trees was an urgent requirement of the masses), the self-defense team, etc. At this point, the congress was adjourned, and the masses returned to the village to carry out joint struggles according to the plan. At this time, the cadres were excited and said: "Like a fire from the sky, it burned the landlords." Poor peasants: "Once we do it, we do it to the end, we might as well wade through with wet shoes!" Old mothers: "Evil has evil retribution, and good has good retribution." Old men: "Changing the dynasty and the emperor, it's our turn!" Children wore the clothes and hats of the landlords and rejoiced. The landlords said: "It's rebellion! It's robbery!" After three to five days, each district completed the plan and distributed the fruits. The second farmers' congress was held.

    More people came to the second farmers' congress. Honest farmers who were "afraid of being drafted into the army" and young men and women came. Almost every district had a congress of about 10,000 people. On the first day, the masses discussed the targets of struggle in each village and made a "blacklist." The small group meetings, with the village as a unit, discussed and decided. The masses made the Party's policies concrete. The most popular slogan was that landlords are evil and the poor are right. To middle peasants, they were told that middle and poor peasants are one family, to henchmen, they were told to atone for their sins, and to poor small villages, they proposed village helping village, neighbor helping neighbor, and farmers helping farmers all over the world. On the second day, People's Heroes were elected. Anyone with a skill could be elected in the joint struggles of the villages. Those who fought the landlords fiercely, those who "broke their faces," those who could publicize, and women who participated in the struggle... were all heroes. Each district elected three hundred, five hundred, or even a thousand. The heroes became representatives of the farmers' association and the women's association. The district presented flowers and wine to these People's Heroes and gave them awards. After the two-day congress closed, the heroes discussed three more questions in the district: (1) Stand firm and never be fooled by the landlords. (2) Perform meritorious service for the people, and distribute the fruits fairly and reasonably, without taking an extra needle or thread. (3) Develop a democratic style, and all issues should be discussed in small groups, with everyone in charge. After the meeting, each hero was eager to make contributions. The farmers also made "competition" (i.e., making contributions) plans. Taking the village as a unit, "fires were lit everywhere, and smoke rose in every village," and the flames of revenge burned every corner. The old way of "breaking through key points and promoting the general" was changed, and the scale was magnificent and rapid. The farmers' association expanded rapidly, with the number of households participating in the farmers' association accounting for 85% to 90% of the total number of households, and accounting for 50% of the total population.

    Support Chairman Mao, Join the Communist Party

    Ten thousand people were boiling, and everywhere you could hear: "Chairman Mao is a life-saving benefactor, this method (land distribution) is so comfortable!" Children sang: "Melons cannot be separated from the seedlings, children cannot be separated from their mothers, and the common people cannot be separated from the Communist Party." "Supporting Chairman Mao and joining the Communist Party" became the demand of the farmers. The Communist Party District Committee openly explained at the mass meeting the Communist Party's proposition of leading the farmers to completely turn themselves over and the conditions that a Communist Party member should possess. A wave was suddenly set off in the venue. Members of the farmers' association said: "I have to go one step further (join the Party)." The old men said: "Whoever you are not in, I have to be in, otherwise I will have a heartache when I die." Those People's Heroes and young lads, how could they hold back, jumped onto the stage and asked the audience: "Am I qualified to join the Communist Party?" From then on, the District Committee's room was crowded with people day and night. Finally, according to county statistics, about 5,000 revolutionary vanguards joined the Communist Party.

    The People's Heroes are the Most Glorious

    The whirlwind-like village struggles of about ten days came to a temporary end, and the second election of People's Heroes was carried out. First, each village elected, five or six people in small villages, and twenty or thirty people in large villages, of which women accounted for about one-third, and then competed in the small area, and finally convened the district's People's Heroes Congress. There were three standards: 1. Fight the landlords fiercely; 2. Distribute the fruits fairly without taking more; 3. Implement small group discussions and the democratic style of everyone being in charge. This was a step up from the first hero condition. Da Liu Zhuang was praised as a model of letting go, and Qian Wang Village was recognized as a model of fair distribution of fruits. The village cadres became selfless People's Heroes. The heroes and models were divided into three classes, and the county and district issued award flags, plaques, couplets, etc. Before the meeting adjourned, the heroes swore to make contributions. Some said: "If I embezzle a grain of food, kill my head." Everyone returned gloriously with a plan to make contributions. Each village welcomed the heroes with gongs and drums, flags and umbrellas fluttering, hero poems, champion lists, and dazzling walls. The blackboard newspaper wrote "Learn from ×××." The hero reports written by elementary school students flew from village to village. Small villages congratulated large villages, not forgetting the kindness of helping. The county government bulletin congratulated the heroes and called for fiercely fighting the landlords and fairly distributing the fruits. Promote the heroes to be cadres, fifty or sixty people in each district. A poor peasant who made a living by selling tofu became a hero, and the district chief led the horse on parade, and he said: "It is not so glorious to divide more!" This sentence became the hope of every mass.

    Three Points of Experience

    The "breaking the situation" stage has come to an end. After about a month (mid-February to mid-March), the county convened a congress of county and district cadres and village branch secretaries. Summarize the experience and elect heroes and models. They believe that the following three questions have been answered: 1. Use administrative orders to support the masses, not to take over and do everything for them. Because at the beginning of the movement, the masses were willing to want land but were afraid of the landlords and did not dare to take action. At this time, we used administrative power to relieve the masses of their worries and inspire the masses to act consciously, not to replace the masses, but to play the role of a midwife. 2. The Farmers' Congress is a bold release, highly concentrated, and is the highest power organ of the farmers. Through the Farmers' Congress, the Party's policies become the policies of the masses, and the masses enrich and develop the Party's policies. For example, on the issue of "taking care," the masses have different countermeasures for different landlords. 3. Continuously selecting models and establishing meritorious service, gradually improving the masses politically (such as fighting the landlords fiercely, distributing the fruits publicly), training backbones organizationally (such as promoting a large number of village and district cadres), and establishing a direction in work. The congress elected three directions for the whole county: Sun Qingdian's direction of being indomitable and incorruptible, and resolutely fighting the landlords. Xu Junjia's direction of letting go and taking the mass line, creating a combination of land distribution, spring plowing and war service in Da Hu Zhuang. Meng Jiyu's direction of the "two lines" of fighting corrupt cadres to the end. The commissioner immediately promoted Meng and Sun to district chiefs, and the prefectural committee promoted Comrade Xu to deputy secretary of the district committee.

    At present, the whole county is developing the second stage on the basis of carrying out the three directions, that is, the peasants step on the landlords again after they have overthrown them.

　　筑先局面轰开了
    郭少英谈  张苏记述
    筑先县（聊城）是冀鲁豫六分区新收复区土地改革运动进展较快的一个例子，运动一来，“村村点火，到处冒烟”，一个月的功夫，便轰开了局面，斗争地主三百余人，受到训练和得到果实的农民有十万人（全县人口三十万），被选为人民功臣的有万余人，其中五百余人被提拔为干部，约五千青壮农民走上前线，被吸收参加共产党者约五千，斗争气势雄壮，规模宏伟，特点是一面斗争，一面分田，（农民清算回若干土地，手边无材料暂缺），其过程是这样：
    搬石头
    新收复区的农民，虽然急切盼望着分田、分粮，但他们慑于数千年压在头上的大石头——地主的血腥统治，又不了解共产党的政策，因此，见到我们的工作人员是心里热（要地）表面冷（怕地主）。筑先县的领导者深体民瘼，坚决执行农民的要求“搬石头”。大批干部下了乡，“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”的政府布告与标语，三天之内贴遍了全县的大小村庄；奸霸、地主是罪犯，农民分田是合法。每个区逮捕地主二三百，全县“石头”搬了二千多。地主心惊胆战，农民扬眉吐气，社会空气为之一变！
    农民大会高于一切
    各区召开农民大会，五千、八千、一万的农民抱着千古罕有的希望来大会“登底”。（看共产党的政策），大会第一天，民主政府将全区罪大恶极的奸霸、地主枪毙一二人，演戏、扭秧歌、闹高跷，兴奋了群众情绪。干部深入群众中去，酝酿诉苦。第二天，宣布伪保长、乡长一律撤职，并将最坏者扣押起来。一二十个积极分子，在大会上首先诉苦，以苦引苦，全场纷纷要求诉苦，于是分为小组会普遍倒起苦水来。凡诉不起来的必有狗腿，当时即将狗腿提出来成立狗腿训练班。千仇万苦，群情激昂，一致要求报仇泄恨，打倒地主。第三天，小组会上制定报仇计划，群众提出“打虎先打头”，“砍倒大树有柴烧”，每区规定斗争大地主五六家。大会上通过后，当场选举临时行动代表会，组织纠察队，砍树队（该区烧柴极端缺乏，砍树为群众迫切要求），自卫队等等。大会至此宣布休会，群众回村，按照计划，分别进行联合斗争。这时干部兴奋，说：像一把天火一样，燃烧了地主。贫农：“一不做二不休，鞋湿了淌吧”！老妈妈：“恶有恶报，善有善报”。老汉：“改朝换帝，兴咱了”！儿童穿戴上地主家的衣服、帽子，欢天喜地。地主说：“反了！抢了”！三五天之后各区完成了计划，分了果实，农民大会第二次召开。
    第二次农民大会，来的人更多了，“怕抓兵”的老实农民、红男绿女都来了，差不多各区都是万人左右的大会。第一天，群众讨论各村的斗争对象，制“黑榜”。以村为单位的小组会讨论，大家决定。群众把党的政策具体化了。最流行的口号是地主就是罪恶，穷人就是道理。对中农是中贫农是一家，对狗腿是带罪图功，对贫苦小村提出村帮村，邻帮邻，天下农民帮农民。第二天，选举人民功臣，在各村联合斗争中，凡有一技之长的都可当选，斗地主狠的，“挖破脸”的，会宣传的，妇女参加斗争的……都是英雄。每区选出三百、五百，多者一千。英雄们做了农会、妇会的代表。对于这些人民的功臣，区上献花献酒，给以奖励。两天大会闭幕后，功臣在区上再讨论三个问题：（一）站稳立场，决不上地主的当。（二）为人民立功，公平合理分配果实，不多要一针一线。（三）养成民主作风，一切问题都要小组讨论，大家当家。散会后，众英雄个个磨拳擦掌，准备立功。农民们也订“比武”（即立功）计划。以村为单位，“到处点火，村村冒烟”，复仇的火焰燃烧了各个角落。一改过去“重点突破，推动一般”的老方式，规模宏伟而迅速。农会飞跃扩大，参加农会的户口占总户数的百分之八十五至九十，占总人口的百分之五十。
    拥护毛主席，参加共产党
    万民沸腾，到处可听到：“毛主席是救命恩人，这法子（分土地）多舒服呀”！儿童歌唱着：“瓜儿离不了秧，孩子离不了娘，老百姓离不了共产党”。“拥护毛主席，参加共产党”，成为农民的要求。共产党区分委在群众大会上公开讲解共产党领导农民翻透身的主张与做一个共产党员所具备的条件。会场上倏时掀起了波澜。农会会员说：“我还得再进一层（入党）”。老头儿说：“你们谁不在我也得在，不然死了是个心病”。那些人民功臣、青年小伙子们，那里还捺得住、跳上台去向台下问道：“我加入共产党够不够格”？从此，区分委的屋子里日夜挤满了人群。最后据县上统计约有五千个革命先锋参加了共产党。
    人民功臣最光荣
    十天左右的狂风暴雨式的分村斗争，暂告一段落，便进行第二次人民功臣的选举。首先各村选举，小村五、六人，大村二、三十人不等，其中妇女约占三分之一，然后到小区竞选，最后召开区的人民功臣大会。标准有三：一、斗地主狠；二、分配果实公平没多占；三、实行了小组讨论，大家当家的民主作风。这比第一次功臣条件提高了一步，大刘庄被誉为放手的模范，前王村公认为公平分配果实的榜样，该村干部成为大公无私的人民功臣。英雄模范分为三等，县区发奖旗、大匾、对联等。散会前，英雄们宣誓立功，有的说：“我贪污一粒粮食杀我的头”。个个带着立功计划光荣归来。各村锣鼓喧天接功臣，旗伞飘扬，功臣诗，状元榜，琳琅满壁。黑板报上写着“向×××学习”。小学生写的功臣报村村飞行。小村贺大村，不忘帮助的恩。县府布告贺功臣，号召狠狠斗地主，公平分果实。提拔功臣当干部，每区五、六十人。一个卖豆腐糊口的贫农当了英雄，区长牵缰骑马游行，他说：“多分点也没有这样光荣”！这句话变成了每个群众的希望。
    三点经验
    “轰局面”阶段至此为止，经过约有一个月的时间（二月中至三月中），县上召开县区干部，村支部书记的功模大会。总结经验，选举功臣与模范。他们认为以下三个问题得到了答案：一、用行政命令，为群众撑腰，不是包办代替。因为运动初期，群众愿要土地而因害怕地主却不敢行动。这时我们用行政力量解除农民的顾虑，启发群众自觉行动起来，不是代替群众，而是起了收生婆的作用。二、农民大会是大胆放手，高度集中，是农民的最高权力机关。经过农民大会，党的政策变成群众的政策，并且群众又充实与发展了党的政策。如“照顾”的问题，群众对不同地主，自有不同对策。三、不断的选模立功，政治上逐步提高群众（如斗地主狠，分果实公），组织上培养了骨干（如提拔了大批村区干部）。工作上树立起方向。大会选出全县三个方向：威武不屈富贵不淫，坚决斗争地主的孙青殿方向。放手走群众路线，创造分地、春耕与战勤结合的大胡庄徐俊价方向。与贪污干部斗争到底的“两条路线”的孟继禹方向。专署当场提升孟、孙二人为区长，地委提升徐同志为区分委副书记。
    目前全县在开展三种方向的基础上，迈上第二阶段，即农民打翻了地主后再踏上一脚。
