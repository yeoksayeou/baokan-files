Actively Laboring to Build a Home and Establish a Career
　　Model Veteran Yue Guiqing
　　Yue Guiqing, a retired serviceman from Caojiayuan, Qinyuan, carried forward the glorious traditions of the old Red Army and actively engaged in labor and production. Yue Guiqing joined the Red Army in 1932 and fought heroically for the revolution for fifteen years. He was wounded several times. Last year, due to excessive blood loss, he could no longer stay with the army and retired to settle in Caojiayuan. When production began this spring, the masses in the village wanted to farm his land for him, but he firmly declined, saying, "It is hard enough for the people to support the front lines; I can still move." So he participated in mutual aid, going to the fields early and returning late every day. In addition to the four mu of land allocated to him by the government, he also opened up ten mu of wasteland and planted crops on time. When he had free time, he also went to the city gates with the villagers to work on urgent tasks. Currently, his crops are growing very well. Yue Guiqing also actively helps military families solve their difficulties. When sowing in April, the military families Zhang Sanhe and Haozi were short of firewood. Yue Guiqing silently went up the mountain to collect firewood and brought it back for them to burn. He also often helped them carry water. The masses said, "Old Yue is truly worthy of being an old Red Army soldier, a meritorious servant of the people!" When the village summarized the spring plowing on May 30, Yue Guiqing was selected as a production model, and the county government specially awarded him the glorious banner of "Model Veteran."

　　积极劳动安家立业
    荣军榜样岳贵清
    沁源曹家圆荣退军人岳贵清发扬老红军光荣传统，积极劳动生产。岳贵清从民国二十一年参加红军，为革命英勇奋斗十五年，曾经数次受伤，至去年因流血过多，不能随军才退伍到曹家圆安家。今春生产开始，该村群众要为他代耕，他坚决谢绝，说：“老百姓支援前线就够辛苦了，我自己还能动”。于是他参加互助，每天起早搭黑上地。除政府拨给他四亩地外，并开了十亩荒地，按时下种，有空时并和村人相随在城关打忙工，目前他的庄稼长得很好。岳贵清并积极帮助军属解决困难。四月播种时，军属张三和郝子两家缺柴火，岳贵清不吭气的上山拾柴回来给他们烧。并经常帮他们担水。群众说：“老岳真够上个红军老战士，人民功臣！”五月三十日该村总结春耕时，岳贵清被选为生产模范，县政府特奖给“荣军榜样”的光荣旗帜。（太岳分社）
