Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 21st: TASS reports that Pravda published an international commentary stating: The plan announced by Marshall in his June 4th speech at the Harvard University alumni meeting (note: this plan is said to be the United States' intention to "aid" the "economic recovery" of the whole of Europe, including the Soviet Union and the new democracies), despite its superficial "novelty," is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to achieve political oppression and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries through monetary "aid," which is the essence of the Truman Doctrine. So why did Marshall cautiously use obscure wording to present the Truman Doctrine to the world? Undoubtedly, it is only because the Truman Doctrine's reputation in Europe and the Americas is becoming increasingly tarnished. On June 12th, when Marshall explained his "European Economic Recovery Plan" at a press conference, he included the Soviet Union, Britain, and other European countries. Obviously, Marshall wants to portray the true picture to the American people as: although he is genuinely willing to participate in the economic recovery of the entire Europe, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries are excluding themselves from Europe because they cannot accept the conditions of American "aid." Marshall's concealment of the true meaning of the Truman Doctrine and his open endorsement of the "United States of Europe plan" both prove that the meaning of the American "aid" policy remains the same as before.

### 真理报评马歇尔演说  美妄图干涉整个欧洲  杜鲁门政策声名日益狼籍

　　真理报评马歇尔演说
    美妄图干涉整个欧洲
    杜鲁门政策声名日益狼籍
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社讯，真理报发表国际评论称：马歇尔六月四日在哈佛大学校友会上之讲演中所宣布的计划（按：该计划据说是美国要“援助”整个欧洲“经济复兴”，包括苏联和新民主国家在内），尽管有其表面“新奇”之处，但也不过是借金元“援助”以达到政治压迫和干涉其他国家内政的杜鲁门计划之希求罢了。那么为什么马歇尔要谨慎的用隐晦的措词把杜鲁门主义陈于世人之前呢？无疑的，只是因为杜鲁门政策在欧洲和美洲的声名日趋狼籍。六月十二日马氏在记者招待会上说明，其“欧洲经济复兴计划”的时候，把苏联、英国和欧洲其他国家包括在内。显然的，马歇尔想把事情的真象向美国人民说成是：虽然他真正愿意参与整个欧洲经济的复兴，可是苏联和东欧各国却将他们排除于欧洲之外。因为美国的“援助”条件，这些国家不能接受。马歇尔此种对杜鲁门政策真实意义的隐讳，和对于“欧洲合众国计划”的公开赞助，都证明美国“援助”政策的意义依然如旧。
