Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Shanghai Dispatch: The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East convened in Shanghai on the 16th. Representatives from ten member nations attended, including the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the United States, France, China (Chiang), India, the Netherlands, Australia, Siam, and the Philippines, totaling over fifty individuals. Additionally, over a hundred representatives appointed by the United Nations, UNRRA, and CNRRA participated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Shanghai Dispatch: The head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Stetsenko, issued a statement at the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, pointing out that the Soviet delegation believes the resolution of the Economic and Social Council regarding the establishment of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East presents the commission with the important task of formulating assistance for the construction of many nations in Asia and the Far East. Assistance to these countries should consist of multifaceted encouragement of the development of their national industries and promotion of economic cooperation among these countries, which would benefit all nations that suffered damage in the Second World War. If the commission's activities are guided by the general principles of the United Nations organization, it will be able to resolve these tasks. This general principle is: all countries are independent and free in their internal affairs, and the internal affairs of all countries, large and small, should not be subject to interference. When the commission performs its duties in accordance with the resolutions of the Economic and Social Council and the actual and significant needs of the various nations and peoples of Asia and the Far East, it should be vigilant so that the economic assistance provided by certain countries and organizations to those nations suffering from the pains of war is not used as political pressure against the latter; because that clearly contradicts the goals established by the United Nations organization itself. The Soviet Union believes that the primary task of the United Nations at present is to establish a permanent and lasting democratic peace on the basis of continuous cooperation with large and small countries, and to ensure the independent and free development of all nations. The Soviet Union will make every effort to implement this cooperation in this regard. All nations yearning for peaceful labor and lasting security will not allow reactionary forces and the remnants of fascism to sow the seeds of hatred and provoke conflicts between countries. Moreover, they will be able to prevent new warmongers and new demagogues from gaining world domination.

　　联合国亚洲及远东经济会议开幕
    苏代表团长发表声明
    各国内部生活不容许外国干涉经济援助不应利用为政治压力
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海讯：联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议于十六日在上海揭幕，到会委员国有苏、英、美、法、中（蒋）、印、荷、澳、暹、菲等十国，代表五十余人，并有联合国指派代表、联总、行总人员等百余人参加。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据塔斯社上海讯：苏联代表团团长斯迭辛科于联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会的会议上发表声明指出：苏联代表团认为经济及社会理事会关于设立亚洲及远东经济委员会之决议，为该委员会提出了制定援助许多亚洲及远东国家之建设的重要任务。对这些国家之援助应在于多方面的鼓励其民族工业之发展，及鼓励在这些国家中组成经济之合作，而裨益于一切遭受到第二次世界大战破坏的国家。假若该委员会之活动将由联合国机构总原则指导，则将能够解决这些任务。这个总原则就是：各国在其内部生活上是独立自由的，这种自由平等的大小国家的内部生活将不容许干涉。当委员会遵照经济及社会理事会之决议，以及亚洲和远东各民族、国家实际上的重大需要而执行职务时，应当提防，使某些国家和组织所予那些遭受战争痛苦之国家的经济援助，不被利用为对后者的政治压力；因为那显然与联合国机构本身所确立的鹄的相抵触。苏联认为：联合国当前的首要工作，就是要在经常与大小国家合作的基础上建立永远与持久的民主和平，并保证各民族独立与自由的发展。苏联将竭力在此方面贯彻这种合作。一切国家热衷于和平之劳动与持久之安全的人民，将不容许反动势力及法西斯的残余分子撒播仇恨的种子及挑起各国间的冲突。而且，将能够防止新战争贩子及新叫嚣者获得世界的统治权。
