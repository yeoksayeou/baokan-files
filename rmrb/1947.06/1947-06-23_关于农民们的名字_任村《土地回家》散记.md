　　On the Names of Peasants
　　Random Notes from Ren Village's "Land Returns Home"
　　Zhan Chao

　　As I became more familiar with the adults and children of Ren Village, I became convinced that nothing could better represent the peasants' aspirations and experiences than the names given to their children.

　　Take the peasants living near my residence, for example. If you ask anyone their name, they can tell you a story about its origin. For instance, the child of the liberated peasant family living diagonally across from my house was named "Escape-Life" because he was born during the Japanese's major "mopping-up" operation in 1942. There were also names like "Famine Year" and "Expensive Rice," all of which were markers of the peasants' tragic lives during the great famine of 1920.

　　The most common names were Wang Shi Cun (Wang Stone-Kept), Chen Tian Cun (Chen Heaven-Kept), Zhang Li Shuan (Zhang Li Tethered), Su Shi Zhu (Su Stone Pillar), Yang Shi Tou (Yang Stone Head), Wang Yi Chou (Wang One Ugly), Su Gui Nv (Su Daughter), and so on. All of these names were related to superstition. Under the feudal regime, peasants lived miserable lives, always feeling that they had bad luck. When they had a child, they were afraid they couldn't keep it safe. So, they would burn incense and pray to the mountain gods at the temple under 圪＠ Mountain or to the big strange stone in the West River Cao, asking them to recognize the child as their godson or to "keep" the child for them. Otherwise, they would raise their own child as an adopted child, or raise a boy as a girl, hence the origin of these names.

　　What I have mentioned above are mostly milk names. When the children grew up, the peasants would ask a "literate teacher" or give their children an "official name" according to their own aspirations. Therefore, names like Rong (Glory), Hua (Splendor), Fu (Wealth), and Gui (Nobility) were uniformly used. The peasants expressed their aspirations in their children's names, but in a society ruled by landlords where "killing the poor does not make one rich," the result was mostly freezing, sickness, starvation, and death! They didn't even have a straw mat to wrap the corpse in! The old man who sat next to me at the village meeting a few days ago said: "Since the day my parents gave me the name 'Zhang Fu' (Zhang Wealthy), life became poorer day by day. In the end, even half a mu of 'blind land' (bad land) was mortgaged to the landlord, and my father died!" He worked as a hired hand in the landlord's house, getting up at five in the morning and working until dark, and couldn't say he wasn't "diligent," but his wages were only enough to feed his mother and himself! Not to mention all that, he ran into "Lin Bei One Tiger," the local tyrant landlord Yue Jianzhen, who created trouble out of nothing. One day, Zhang Fu was carrying soil to the "master's" field when Yue Jianzhen walked over menacingly and insisted that Zhang Fu had stolen his soil. Without explanation, Yue's gang of "wolves" (thugs) had already pressed Zhang Fu to the ground, beating him with fists and sticks. "Look, the broken carrying pole from that beating is still here today!" Every time Zhang Fu said this, he would pull down his waistband, point to a scar near his navel, and express his indignation. Because of this injury, he lay on the kang for three whole months.

　　Just when Zhang Fu was barely able to walk, Yue Jianzhen's "wolves" knocked him down again. After beating him three times, he was finally sent to the county government. Yue Jianzhen was not satisfied and bribed the dog officials with fifty silver dollars, almost beating Zhang Fu to death. Zhang Fu said: "At that time, I thought: wealthy or not, as long as I can live in peace and not starve, that's good enough. Who knew that those tiger-wolf landlords and officials wouldn't let me! Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party, I, Zhang Fu, am truly 'Zhang Fu'!" During the anti-traitor and anti-hegemon campaign, "Lin Bei One Tiger" was dealt with. Other landlords and local bullies were given their due punishment in the land reform and other movements. Zhang Fu and his wife gained six mu of land and six rooms, and he said very happily: "The tiger-wolves' road has come to an end. Now is the time for us peasants to produce and get rich, to turn from poor to wealthy." When talking about the word "Fu" (Wealthy) related to his name, his voice was particularly loud.

　　After the implementation of land reform in Ren Village, all the old-fashioned names were regarded by the peasants as milestones in their lives. Some gave new explanations to their old names. For example, Su Ri Jiang, the chairman of the Third Street Farmers' Association, whose original official name was Su You Tian (Su Has Land), liked this "official name" even more when he associated it with "the tillers have their land." He would tell everyone, "My name is 'You Tian'!" Many peasants have begun to give their children "turnover names." Several times I was invited to participate in this new type of "naming ceremony" in peasant families (for the time being).

　　"Old Du, give my child a new name." I was stumped, and finally came up with a good idea: ask the whole family to express their opinions. So, everyone started talking, some advocating to call him "Victory," and others advocating other names. As a result, Wang Changling's boy was named "Freedom," and Wang Baozhong's girl was named "Equality." The liberated peasant women were particularly interested in the latter name, chattering endlessly. On the way home, I met another peasant who asked me to paint a portrait of his eight-month-old "Liberation." It was late, and I promised to paint it later. At the bend, I met Fu Yueqi, the grandfather of little "Democracy." He said that his child had written from the front saying that the name "Democracy" was good, but the meaning was too great, and he was afraid it wouldn't match, so he should change it to a new name. He suggested calling him "Jian Hua" (Build China), on the one hand, as a member of building the new Republic of China, and on the other hand, as rebuilding Hua County, because he had participated in the victorious Hua County Campaign. Hua and Hua are homophones. …

　　When I saw these children named "Turnover" and "Liberation" clapping their little hands in front of the portrait of the revolutionary leader and affectionately calling out to Chairman Mao, I couldn't help but think of a sentence: "When the peasants accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take action, they are no longer slaves of the land, but masters of the land, and the days of suffering will forever, forever leave them."

　　关于农民们的名字
    任村《土地回家》散记
    展  潮
    和任村的大人小孩逐渐惯熟起来的时候，我相信，再没有什么比给小孩起名字，更能代表农民的企求与遭遇了。
    就以我住处邻近的农民来说吧，随便问到那个人的名字，他都可以告诉你一段来历的。例如我房子斜对门那家翻身户的孩子，因为是在一九四二年日本人大“扫荡”时候生的，就叫个“逃生”。还有叫“荒年”，叫“米贵”的那都是民国九年大灾荒年，农民悲惨生活的标志。
    最通常的名字是王石存、陈天存、张李拴、苏石柱、杨石头、王一丑、苏闺女等等。这一类名字都与迷信相关。农民在封建政权下过着惨淡的生活，总是觉得自己命不好，养了个孩子，生怕保不住，不是到圪＠山下的山神庙里，便是到西河漕里的大怪石跟前，烧香祷告，请它们认做干儿或替自己“存”下来。再不然就是亲生儿当养子养，男孩当女孩养，因此就起了这一类名字。
    以上所说，大抵都是奶名。等到孩子长大成人，农民们便请“识字先生”，或是按照自己的企求给孩子起个“官名”，因此什么荣呀，华呀，富呀，贵呀，都千篇一律的叫起来了，农民把自己的企求表达在孩子们的名字上面，但是在地主统治“不杀穷人不富”的社会里，到头来大多是冻、病、饿、死！甚至连卷尸首的席片都没有！前几天村里开会时跟我坐在一块的那位老汉便说：自从爹娘给他起“张富”这个名字那天起，日子一天更比一天穷，最后连半亩“瞎巴地”（坏地）也押给了地主，父亲也死了！他在地主家里当长工，起五更搭黑不能说不“勤劳”，但是他的工钱只够娘儿俩糊嘴！这些都不去说它，偏碰上个“林北一只虎”，恶霸地主岳建祯，没事生事，那天早起张富正往“主家”地搬土，岳建祯虎视眈眈地走过来，硬说张富偷了他的土，不由分辩岳家的一干“狼”（打手）已把张富压在地下，拳棒交加地打着，“你看，到今天打折了的篇担钩还留在这里！”张富每说到这里，总要把裤腰往下一抹，指了指肚脐左近的一块伤痕说，表示他的激愤，为了这块伤，他整整在坑上躺了三个月。
    待张富刚能走动的时候，岳建祯的“狼”们又把他打倒了。连打三次，最后送到县衙门里。岳建祯还不甘心，拿五十块现洋收买狗官们，险些没有把张富打死了。张富说：“那时辰，心想：富不富吧，只要能安生赶穷嘴也算，谁知那干虎狼地主老官就不让！自从来了八路军共产党，我张富才真正是个‘张富”了！反奸霸的时候，收拾了“林北一只虎”。其他地主恶霸，在土地改革等运动中，都受到应有的惩罚。张富老俩口闹到六亩地、六间房，他非常痛快地说：“虎狼的走道已经到头了，现今是咱庄稼汉生产发家，由穷变富的时候了”。当说到和他名字相关的“富”字时，声音特别响亮。
    实现了土地改革后的任村，所有旧式的名字，都被农民当作自己生活的一块里程碑来看了，有的是把旧名字作新解释。如三街农会主席苏日江，原来官名就叫个苏有田，当他联系到“耕者有其田”时，他更喜欢这个“官名”了，见人就说我叫个“有田”。不少农民已开始给自己孩子起“翻身名”了，有几次我还被请去参加农家这种新型的“命名礼”（权且这样说吧）。
    “老杜，给俺孩起个新名字吧”。我被难住了，终于想出个好办法，请他们全家发表意见，于是你一言我一语地说起来了，有人主张叫“胜利”，有人主张叫别的，结果王长龄的男孩叫“自由”，王保忠的女孩叫“平等”，对于后一个名字，翻了身的农妇特别感到兴趣，咭咭呱呱谈个不休；在回家路上，我碰到另一个农民，叫我给他八个月的小“解放”画像，天晚了，我答应以后再画。在拐弯的地方，我又遇见了小“民主”的祖父傅月其。他说他孩在前方来信说“民主”这个名好倒是好，就是意义太大了，怕配不上，还是另起个新名吧。他提议叫“建华”，一方面当作建设新中华民国的一分子来讲，一方面当作重建滑县讲，因为他曾经参加过胜利的滑县战役，滑和华同音。……
    当我看到这群以“翻身”“解放”为名的孩子们，在革命领袖像前，拍着小手，亲热地呼唤着毛主席的时候，不禁联想起一句话：“当农民接受共产党领导，行动起来的时候，他们不再是土地的奴隶，而是土地的主人，苦难的日子也将永远地永远地离开他们”。
