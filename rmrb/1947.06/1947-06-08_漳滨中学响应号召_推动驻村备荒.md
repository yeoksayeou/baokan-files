　　Zhangbin Middle School Responds to Call
    Promotes Stationed-in-Village Preparations for Famine
    [This newspaper's Taihang News] Zhangbin Middle School, after seeing Chairman Yang's call for thrift and famine preparation, the school asked each class to discuss it. The students mentioned that the victory of the self-defense war plays a huge role in guaranteeing material supplies. Recalling the great famine of the year before last, everyone unanimously agreed to save three liang of rice per day. The teacher training class even proposed that it's not enough for just our school to save. To implement this at the grassroots level, we must mobilize the landlords (fellow villagers) of each group to save carefully and prepare for famine, and through them, expand to neighboring families. The next day, with the exception of a few people, Principal Li and all the teachers and students went out together to help the stationed-in-village comrades carry water and plant flowers. The newly arrived (female) teacher, Ms. Xue, and the sixty-year-old Mr. Li Qingbo, were also sweating as they planted flower seeds. Fourteen-year-old female students Li Qiaorong, Wu Meiying, and others were covered in sweat but kept lifting and carrying, refusing to rest. The villagers were moved and said, "The radio station will definitely commend them tonight." (Wen He, Zi An, Zhong Min)

　　漳滨中学响应号召
    推动驻村备荒
    【本报太行讯】漳滨中学看到杨主席的节约备荒号召，学校叫各班讨论，同学们提到自卫战争的胜利，物资供应起极大保证作用，再回想到大前年灾荒，大家一致同意每日节约三两米。后师班更提出不仅光咱学校节约，为贯彻到下层，要动员各组房东（老乡）细水常流节约备荒，通过他们再扩大到邻家。第二天全校除数少人外，李校长同全体师生一齐出动帮助驻村担水种花，新来的（女）薛先生和年六十多岁的李清玻先生，也流着汗点花籽。十四岁的女同学李乔荣、吴美英等满身流汗都不停的前晌抬后晌抬不肯休息。感动老乡们说：“今晚广播台一定表扬他们”。（文和、子安、中民）
