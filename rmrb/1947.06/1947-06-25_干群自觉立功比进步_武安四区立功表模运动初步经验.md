　　Cadres and Masses Consciously Compete to Achieve Merit and Make Progress
    Preliminary Experiences in the Merit and Model Movement in the Fourth District of Wu'an
    Wu Yun

    Following the solidarity between cadres and the masses to squeeze out feudalism, the Fourth District of Wu'an used the central link of establishing merit and setting an example to summarize the masses' liberation, deepen the unity and conscious movement, transform branches and improve party members, and, on the basis of the cadres' and masses' conscious and enthusiastic participation, combine further review and launch a large-scale production and drought prevention movement. The method is to hold meetings of party members, honest farmers, and activists, with party members and the masses training and laboring at the same time. The preliminary experiences of the merit and model movement are introduced as follows:

    I. Enhance the Consciousness of Merit and Launch Commendation and Modeling

    Party members, cadres, and activists had the following ideological obstacles at the beginning of their commendation: (1) Not knowing what constitutes merit, who has merit, and not being able to find merit. They believed that fighting Chiang Kai-shek at the front was merit, fighting petty Chiang's in the rear didn't count as merit, Mao Zedong had merit, they didn't, and big cadres had merit, but small members didn't; (2) Fearing that the commendation wouldn't be recognized, which would be very embarrassing; (3) Not knowing why to commend, believing that it was boasting, showing off, and selling old qualifications, so they were unwilling to commend; (4) Thinking that it didn't matter whether they commended or not, that they would be working anyway, and that it was right to serve the people. They believed that good cadres didn't need to establish merit, and whether or not they established merit, they would still be active; (5) Not seeking merit but seeking no mistakes, believing that it didn't matter whether they commended or not, and that they would be satisfied as long as they didn't make mistakes; (6) Believing that merit should be commended by others, and that it didn't count if they said they were good. They were unwilling to commend themselves, but willing to have others commend them, believing that one good word from others was better than ten good words from themselves, and that good cadres didn't commend their own merits; (7) Small cadres looked at big cadres, and village cadres looked at district cadres, only commending themselves when they saw others commending themselves, believing that since others with greater merits didn't commend themselves, their little merit wasn't worth mentioning.

    Therefore, to carry out commendation, it is necessary to first break down these ideological obstacles, clarify the significance and purpose of the merit movement, overcome negativity and passivity, and enhance the consciousness of cadres and the masses to establish merit. The Fourth District used the method of summarizing liberation to commend the merits of cadres and the masses, allowing them to clarify and affirm their merits from historical comparisons such as comparing social conditions, comparing times, and comparing progress, from recalling the process of liberation, recalling the path of struggle, and recalling the history of the branch, and recognizing that not only the front has merit, but the rear also has merit, Mao Zedong has merit, and village cadres and the masses also have merit. After the masses of Dongxi Tongle compared and found twelve great benefits of the new society, they further realized that the liberation and awakening of the peasants came through many twists and turns and difficult struggles; countless martyrs shed blood and sacrificed themselves, countless cadres neglected work and stayed up late working hard, and tens of millions of masses united and struggled to create collectively. It was clarified that cadres have ten major merits in working behind enemy lines, eliminating feudalism, opposing special agents, uniting middle peasants, promoting the backward, fairly distributing fruits, implementing democracy and changing their style, withdrawing excess fruits, joining the army and participating in the war, and promoting mutual aid in production. From recalling these struggles, party members, cadres, and the masses not only recognized their merits, but also learned many useful experiences and lessons, and saw many good examples, thus greatly enhancing everyone's class consciousness and solidarity. For example, the masses of Nan Fengchang said: "Our village head, Xiao Hei, although his style is not good, has the greatest merit in fighting landlords and rectifying special agents. Everyone is indeed ruthless and doesn't care about life or death, and everyone should learn from him in this regard." In this way, everyone gradually reached a consensus on why to commend and who to commend, clarifying that commendation is not about boasting or showing off, nor is it about being arrogant, selfish, or blowing one's own horn. Commendation is to promote work, encourage everyone to learn from the good, commend the active and motivate the backward, support the righteous and suppress the evil, and advocate the good and correct the bad. Therefore, this is a very serious revolutionary work, and it is the glorious responsibility of good cadres and good party members. At the same time, everyone naturally realized that since commendation is for the work and for the masses, everyone should actively and voluntarily commend themselves. One knows one's own merits, and one cannot deny one's own merits. Saying one's own good is better than others saying ten good, because self-commendation is always from a small perspective and one doesn't dare to exaggerate, while others' commendation may be easier to exaggerate. Self-commendation allows others to add to the commendation, thus solving the problem of who should commend and how to commend. Finally, using the method of comparing three types of cadres: those with merit and no mistakes, those with merit and mistakes, those with great merit and small mistakes, and those with no merit and no mistakes, to break through everyone's commendation thinking, and let everyone discuss which type of cadre is good. Realizing that being a cadre without merit is a mistake, and that doing the job mechanically is letting down the masses and letting down Chairman Mao, realizing that establishing merit is the most glorious, and that those with merit can be rewarded. Commendation is to promote everyone's progress, and it is not right to only talk and not act. It is also not right to only act and not talk. Only by doing both can one lead the masses to progress.

    In this way, the consciousness of cadres to establish merit for the people was inspired, the confidence of cadres in commending merit was enhanced, an atmosphere of commending merit and comparing progress was created, and passivity was transformed into active initiative. Whoever does not commend is not glorious, and is considered to have inconsistent thinking. At the same time, the leadership focused on the branch, on the one hand, mobilizing party members and cadres to take the lead in commending merit and cultivating a large number of active commenders; on the other hand, breaking through typical examples, letting good cadres commend merit first to demonstrate, and the leadership also taking the lead in commending merit, thus promoting all cadres and the masses, and everyone scrambled to commend their merits.

    II. Mass Line for Evaluating Merit and Selecting Models

    Evaluating merit means letting the masses approve the cadres' merits, so it is necessary to let go of democracy and let everyone discuss, so as to mobilize the masses, educate the masses, and achieve fairness and accuracy. The main problem in evaluating and recording merit lies in inspiring the responsibility consciousness of cadres and the masses, making everyone realize that evaluating well or badly is our responsibility, and that evaluating merit well or badly is related to everyone's interests, clarifying that only by correctly evaluating merit can we truly encourage progress and encourage good cadres. Therefore, the evaluation of merit must be combined with the examination of merit, distinguishing between true and false merits and drawing class lines. For example, the village head of ×× village used to send letters to our side when he was a puppet head, and he wanted to use this to establish merit, but the masses said: "This cannot be considered merit, because he did not truly serve the people. If this is considered merit, then all the puppet heads have merit." In Dong Tongle, someone wanted to attribute the merit of opening up work to the political director, but many people immediately opposed, saying that this was not his merit, but the merit of Xing Juguo (an activist). There was also a village that reviewed the merit of a struggle target in the evaluation of merit, and the masses did not approve it, saying that he could only redeem himself through merit. Secondly, the commendation of merit should be combined with the supplementing of merit. For example, the public security officer of Shagou had merit but could not express it, and the masses supplemented a lot of merit for him. A good cadre was sacrificed in Nan Fengchang, and everyone also supplemented his merit. Finally, individuals and villages should also compare merit with each other to balance the standards of merit points, so that the disadvantaged are not dissatisfied due to excessively high or low evaluations.

    Secondly, what counts as merit, and how is the size of merit divided? The situation among the masses is very complicated, and it is difficult to specify the standards for establishing merit, but generally speaking, anyone who is firm in their position, actively responsible, democratic in their style, and completes or exceeds their tasks in any work, or achieves certain results, should be credited. For example, the director of the Da Tun Military Committee, after self-commendation and mass supplementation, the masses and the merit establishment committee evaluated his merits in eleven articles, and rated a total of one hundred points according to the size of the merit: (1) Heroically protecting staff behind enemy lines, leading the way, sending letters, and sending intelligence, twenty-five points; (2) Gaining control of the regime while Yang Sizi was still there, overthrowing the head of the Bao, and opening up the work situation in Da Tun, fifteen points; (3) Organizing the farmers' association three times and overthrowing the three major tyrants, twenty-five points; (4) Completing the task of two new soldiers alone in the first expansion of the army (three tasks in the whole village), seven points; (5) Not being discouraged by face-washing, withdrawing excess fruits to help poor brothers (a good courtyard, twenty acres of good land), eight points...

    The method of recording merit is to calculate and convert the nature and quantity of merit in a unified manner. Twenty points or more is third-class merit, sixty points or more is second-class merit, one hundred points or more is first-class merit, and one hundred and fifty points or more is special-class merit. Merit is recorded for merit, and demerit is recorded for demerit. Merit can be used to offset demerit, but merit cannot be reduced due to demerit. (Some districts divide the nature of merit into several levels, and merit does not offset merit. These methods are all in trial implementation).

    On the basis of commending and evaluating merit, various models (party members, cadres, members, women, military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, veterans, production models, spinning and weaving models, liberated peasants) were also democratically selected. The conditions for model cadres are: 1. Resolutely and mercilessly fighting landlords, protecting the interests of the masses, and standing firm; 2. Distributing fruits selflessly and fairly, leading the whole village to achieve leveling and compensation; 3. Everyone is the master of the house, with a democratic style, and honestly supported by the masses; 4. Good cadres are not afraid of raising opinions, accept criticism, and wash their faces frequently; 5. Resolutely implement the instructions of the higher authorities, complete tasks, and follow the mass line; 6. Work and production are not delayed, and they take the lead in everything as a model. After the selection of models, each village has a banner and backbone, so there are heroes to lead the masses in any work.

    III. Celebration Meeting

    After the cadres and the masses carefully evaluated merit and selected models, a large number of meritorious models emerged in each village. In the ten villages of the Da Tun base area, there were one hundred cadres and forty-two members, and military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, and spinning women established merit. Each village selected seventy model cadres, members, military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, veterans, and spinning women, and twenty-nine model party members. When the good news came out, each village warmly welcomed and celebrated, posted a list of meritorious people, and held a celebration meeting. The district merit establishment committee also issued various medals and certificates, and people were all high-spirited and beaming with joy.

    After establishing and celebrating merit, the masses further realized the difficulties of being a cadre, clarified the merits of the cadres, and enhanced their awareness of respecting cadres and comparing progress. The cadres also further realized the strength of the masses and the importance of uniting the masses, and enhanced their consciousness of relying on the masses and establishing more merit for the people. In the discussions, the masses in each village unanimously realized that: The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are our saviors, and the cadres and activists are our guides. Only by uniting the cadres and the masses can we eliminate feudalism. We must learn from the progress of the cadres, and there are several benefits to progress: (1) Knowing to follow Chairman Mao's path, one's eyes are bright; (2) One cannot be fooled by landlords and special agents, one's thinking is clear; (3) One cannot be the tail of landlords and feudalism, one's body is clean; (4) Production is energetic and one dares to become rich, time is strong; (5) One's ideological awareness is early, one can turn over quickly, and suffer less; (6) Everyone says that we are active, and our reputation is good; (7) One can have a say in the village and have a place to pull; (8) Serving the people, one's merit is great; (9) In the future, defeating Chiang Kai-shek, the future is great. So it is better to make progress than to lag behind. Only progress can establish merit and thoroughly turn over.

    After the cadres and masses established the consciousness of establishing merit and comparing progress, their enthusiasm and creativity were greatly developed. In order to fight against the drought, each village launched a warm merit competition. Each village also used the method of accounting to propose four more productions (planting one more mu of land, planting more flowers on one mu of land, weaving one more jin of cloth, organizing one more person); four less savings (smoking one less cigarette, drinking one less liang of wine, buying one less jin of meat, eating one less sesame cake) and eight propaganda items: "The benefits of planting cotton are great, spinning and weaving can overcome famine, saving is equivalent to production, relying on the sky to starve, 'struggle' cannot last long, there are rewards for getting rich, heroes take the lead, organizing is powerful" and other specific production and drought prevention methods.

　　干群自觉立功比进步
    武安四区立功表模运动初步经验
    吴  云
    武安四区继干群团结挤封建之后，即通过立功表模这一中心环节，总结群众翻身，深入团结自觉运动，改造支部和提高党员，并在干群自觉和饱满热情的基础上，结合进一步复查，开展大规模的生产防旱运动。方法是召开党员大会、老实农民和积极分子大会，党员和群众同时训练同时劳动。现将立功表模运动的初步经验介绍如下：
    一、提高立功自觉开展表功表模
    党员、干部和积极分子在开始表功时，存有如下几个思想障碍：（一）不知啥是功，谁们才有功，找不着功劳，认为前方打大老蒋才有功，后方打小蒋不算功，毛主席才有功，咱们没有功，大干部才有功，小会员没有功；（二）怕表了功并不上功，这有多丢人；（三）不知为啥表功，认为表功是夸功，是出风头卖老资格，所以不愿表功；（四）认为表不表都没啥，表也是干，不表也是干，反正给老百姓办事就对了，认为好干部用不着立功，立功不立功还能不积极干；（五）不求有功但求无过，认为表不表不顶啥，咱也不想立功劳，只求没错误就够本了；（六）认为功要别人表，自己说好还能算，自己表功还能算功？自己有功不愿意表，愿意叫别人给自己表，认为自己说十个好不如别人说一个好，好干部自己不表自己的功；（七）小干部看大干部，村干部看区干部，见别人表自己才表，认为人家比咱功劳大都还不表，咱这点功劳还值得说。
    因此要开展表功必须首先打破这些思想障碍，明确立功运动的意义和目的性，克服消极和被动，提高干群的立功自觉。四区是用总结翻身的方法表扬干群功劳，让干群从比世道、比时光、比进步等历史对比中，从回忆翻身经过，回忆斗争道路，回忆支部历史中明确和肯定自己的功劳，认识到不仅前方有功后方也有功，毛主席有功，村干部和群众也有功。东西同乐群众对比出新社会十二条大好处之后就进一步认识到农民的翻身和觉悟是经过许多曲折和困难的斗争得来的；无数先烈流血牺牲，无数干部误工熬夜费尽辛苦，千万群众团结斗争集体创造。明确了干部在敌后工作，消灭封建，反对特务，团结中农，推动落后，公平分配果实，实行民主改变作风，退出多得果实，参军参战及生产互助中的十大功劳。党员、干部和群众从回忆这些斗争历史中，不仅认识了自己的功劳，而且学到了许多有益的经验教训，看到了许多活的好榜样，因而也就大大提高了大家的阶级自觉和团结自觉。例如南冯昌群众说：“俺村村长小黑的，虽然作风不好，但是斗争地主整特务，谁也没有他功劳大，大家确实是铁面无情生死不顾，这点大家都应该向他学习。”这样大家对于为啥表功，表功是为谁，也就逐渐获得了一致认识，明确了表功不是夸功出风头，也不是自大自私自己给自己吹，表功劳是为推动工作，推动大家向好的学习，表扬积极发动落后，扶植正气压倒邪气，提倡好的纠正坏的。所以这是很严肃的革命工作，是好干部好党员的光荣责任。同时大家也就自然认识到表功既然是为工作为群众，所以人人都应该自己积极主动表功，自己的功自己知道，自己的功自己昧不了，自己说一个好顶住别人说十个好，因为自己表功总是从小处说不敢夸大，旁人给表功有时反而容易夸大，自己表功别人可以补功，这样就解决了谁来表功和怎样表功的问题。最后运用对比有功无过，有功有过，功大过小，和无功无过三种干部的办法，打通大家表功的思想，让大家讨论那一种干部好。认识到当干部无功就是过，当一天和尚撞一天钟，就是对不起群众对不起毛主席，认识到立功最光荣，有功能受奖励，表功是推动大家进步，光说不做不对，光做不说也不行，又要做又要说，才能领导群众进步。
    这样就启发了干部为人民立功的自觉，提高了干部表功的信心，造成表功劳比进步的空气，变消极被动为积极主动，谁不表功反而不荣，被认为思想不通。同时领导上则抓紧支部，一方面发动党员、干部带头表功，培养大量表功积极分子；另方面则突破典型，让好干部先表功示范，领导上也带头表功，这样就推动了所有干部和群众，大家都争先恐后的表起功来。
    二、群众路线评功评模
    评功劳就是让群众来批准干部的功劳，因此必须放手民主，让大家来评议，才能发动群众教育群众并且做到公平确实。评功记功中主要的问题在于启发干部和群众的责任自觉，使大家认识到评好评坏是咱们的责任，评功好坏对大家的利害关系，明确只有做到正确评功才能真正鼓励进步、鼓励好干部。因此评功必须和审功结合，分清真假功绩划清阶级界线，例如××村长过去当伪保长时曾给我方送信，他想借此也立个功，但是群众说：“这不能算功，因为他不是真正为人民服务，这要算功，那么当伪保长都有功了。”东同乐有人想把开辟工作的功劳立在政治主任身上，但马上许多人提出反对，说这不是他的功，这是邢聚国（积极分子）的功。还有的村在审功中审查出斗争对象也想立功，群众批不准，说他只能将功赎罪。其次表功要和补功结合，如沙沟公安员有功说不出，群众给他补了很多的功。南冯昌牺牲了一个好干部，大家也给他补了功。最后，个人与个人之间，村与村之间还要进行互相比功，平衡功分标准，这才不致评分太高或过低，使吃了亏的不满意。
    其次，什么才算功，功大小如何分？在群众中情况很复杂，立功标准很难具体规定，但一般的说来，凡在任何一种工作中，立场坚定，积极负责，作风民主，群众路线地完成任务或超过任务，或获有一定成绩的都应该记功。例如大屯武委会主任，经自己表功大家补功后，群众和立功委员会评定其功绩十一条，根据功绩大小评定分数共一百分：（一）敌后英勇保护工作人员，带路、送信、送情报，二十五分；（二）杨四子还在就掌握了政权，推倒保长，打开大屯工作局面，十五分；（三）三次组织农会，斗倒三大恶霸，二十五分；（四）第一次扩军中一个人完成二名新战士任务（全村三名任务），七分；（五）洗脸不泄气，退出多得果实帮助穷弟兄（一座好院，二十亩好地），八分……。
    记功的办法是立功性质和数量统一计算折合，二十分以上为三等功，六十分以上为二等功，百分以上为一等功，百五十分以上为特等功，有功记功，有过记过，可以将功折过，不能因过减功。（有的区是按功劳性质，每样分出若干功等，功不折功，这些办法，均在试行中）。
    在表功评功的基础上又民主的评选了各种模范（党员、干部、会员、妇女、军烈属、荣退、生产、纺织、翻身），模范干部条件是：一、斗争地主坚决不留情，保护群众利益，立场坚决；二、分配果实大公无私，领导全村做到填平补齐；三、大家当家作风民主，老老实实群众拥护；四、好干部不怕提意见，接受批评经常洗脸；五、坚决执行上级指示，完成任务走群众路线；六、工作、生产两不耽误，样样事情带头起模范。评选模范之后各村有了旗帜和骨干，这样在任何一个工作中都有了英雄带领群众。
    三、庆功大会
    经过干群慎重评功、评模之后，各村涌现出大量的功臣模范。大屯基点十个村就有一百个干部和四十二个会员，军、烈属纺妇立了功，各村选出七十个模范干部、会员、军烈属、荣退、纺妇，二十九个模范党员。喜报传出，各村均热烈欢迎庆祝，出功臣榜，举行庆功大会，区立功委员会并发给各样奖章、奖状，人们都兴高彩烈，喜气洋洋。
    经过立功庆功，群众更加体会到当干部的困难，明确了干部的功劳，提高了尊干和比进步的自觉，干部也更进一步认识到群众的力量和团结群众的重要，提高了干部依靠群众和为人民更多立功的自觉。各村群众在讨论中一致认识了：共产党毛主席是咱们的救命星，干部、积极分子又是咱们的带路人，干群团结才能消灭封建，咱们要学习干部的进步，进步有几条好处：（一）知道走毛主席的路，眼睛亮；（二）上不了地主特务的当，思想明；（三）当不了地主封建尾巴，身干净；（四）生产有劲敢发家，时光强；（五）思想觉悟早，翻身翻的快，少受罪；（六）人人说咱积极，名誉好；（七）村上能说上话，有地拉；（八）为人民大众服务，功劳大；（九）将来打败老蒋，前途大。所以还是进步比落后好，进步才能立功，才能彻底翻身。
    干群树立了立功比进步的自觉以后，积极性和创造性大为发扬，为了和天旱作斗争，各村掀起了热烈的立功竞赛。各村还用算账的办法，提出生产四多（多种一亩地，多点一亩花，多织一斤布，多组织一个人）；节约四少（少吸一根烟，少喝一两酒，少买一斤肉，少吃一个烧饼）及八项宣传：“种棉利益大，纺织能渡荒，节约顶生产，靠天饿肚肠，‘斗争’吃不长，发家有奖赏，英雄起带头，组织起来有力量”等具体生产防旱办法。
