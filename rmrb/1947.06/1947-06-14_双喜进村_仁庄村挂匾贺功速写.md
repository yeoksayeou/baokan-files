　　Double Happiness Enters the Village
    A Quick Sketch of Ren Zhuang Village Hanging Plaques to Celebrate Merit
    Shu Yu
    When the spring plowing and sowing were completed, Ren Zhuang Village in Licheng County congratulated the families of Shen Fuqi and Zhang Tiancai, soldiers at the front. Shen Fuqi was a special-class model worker in the 6050th Regiment; Zhang Tiancai was a third-class model worker in the same regiment. The two commendation notices arrived at the same time, and everyone in Ren Zhuang Village was happy, calling it "Double Happiness Enters the Village."

    On June 2nd, the entire village of Ren Zhuang hung plaques for the two military families, with continuous cannon fire and festive drum music. Behind the plaques, flags, and carried gifts, a long procession went into the village to "show off their merit." Passing through the town street, it caused a sensation among the people from all directions who had come to the market. The long street was blocked. Some people said it was like a wedding, but they had never seen such a grand wedding. Everyone's eyes were focused on the two large black-lacquered plaques. The one for Shen Fuqi read "Rendering Meritorious Service to the People," and the one for Zhang Tiancai read "People's Hero." People exclaimed: "Ren Zhuang Village strives to be strong in everything, and those who join the army bring glory to the village!"

    At this time, the two military families were busy preparing to welcome the plaques. The two old ladies of the families cooked bean sprouts that had been sprouted for several days in a pot, and put the pastries (i.e., large round steamed buns with red dots) sent by several relatives into a steamer. Fuqi's mother also urged her eldest child, Anzhu, to change into the white cloth shirt that had just been made yesterday and have his head shaved. The women from the village who were helping out did not let them cook themselves, but urged them to change their clothes. Tiancai's mother wore a large blue cloth shirt that was knee-length (this shirt had once been worn by the housekeeper of a rich man's family), and wrapped a white towel around her head; Fuqi's mother turned a washed cotton jacket into a clean lined jacket and covered her head with a gray-blue cloth headscarf. The young daughters-in-law pushed the two of them out, laughing in a heap. Neighbor Fengqi's mother habitually joked with Fuqi's mother: "You're more stylish than when you got married when you were younger!" Fuqi's mother covered her mouth and smiled, saying, "This is thanks to our Fu'er!" The cadres who were helping to organize the celebration said: "It's also because you wiped his poop and pee, changed his wet clothes for dry ones, and fed him milk and rice. Without you, would there be him?"

    Two hours passed, and the masses who went to the town to "show off their merit" had not yet returned. Under the new gate tower of Fuqi's house (this brick-covered gate tower was built with the help of the village), their relatives and the people from the village who were helping out were sitting, and everyone was talking about the family affairs of the two military families: "Tiancai's family fled from Wu'an due to the famine and settled in our Ren Zhuang. Five years ago, when the Japanese came to sweep through the area, his father was killed by the Japanese devils. Tiancai wanted to join the army to avenge him in a fit of anger. At that time, the village cadres didn't want him to go, fearing that people would say that Ren Zhuang Village was tricking outsiders into joining the army! But he went all the way to the district to sign up and left! This child is very promising and has indeed made meritorious contributions at the front." Anzhu interjected: "Our family has also suffered, and in the past, we had no food after paying rent for farming other people's land. When my father was alive, he worked for others all his life. My brothers and I were still running around naked. Since we overturned the rent and divided the land that year, we have had land to cultivate. Fuqi became a militiaman at the age of fifteen, then became a district militia, then became a county militia, and then became a regular soldier. He's only twenty-one this year, and he hasn't come back once! The village treats us very well, and now we are prosperous middle peasants!"

    The sound of cannons and drums echoed through the village. The crowd that went to the town to "show off their merit" had returned. Several young women still surrounded the two old ladies and went forward to greet them. The commendation ceremony was held under the prepared meeting place shed. The two old ladies sat side by side on the welcoming seat. Other military family members, families of martyrs, and retired soldiers sat next to them. Guests such as representatives from the border government, administrative office, county government, district workers, and neighboring villages sat on the side seats. Women and children scrambled to present gifts and flowers to the two old ladies. Many people's eyes were fixed on them. Tiancai's mother looked straight ahead in a dignified manner, while Fuqi's mother was still smiling, with tears in her eyes. Tiancai's mother said calmly: "My Tiancai is doing a good job at the front, and I am also honored at home. Everyone in the village has worked hard. I will write a letter to tell my Tiancai: 'Fight well and win battles to repay the kindness of our village.'" People applauded happily. Fuqi's mother smiled so hard that she couldn't lift her head. "I can't speak, and there's nothing to say!" Everyone urged her to speak, and she raised her face and took a deep breath: "I said I am very happy. If it weren't for my Fu'er, could we have built this brick-covered gate tower and hung this big plaque? The border government, the administrative office, the county government, and old Wang from the district... would they have come to congratulate us?" She smiled and continued in a calm tone: "My Fu'er has made meritorious contributions at the front. My Anzhu is farming at home and is the head of a mutual aid team, and he also helps other military families with their farming. My Anqi is in the cooperative, completely detached from production, serving the masses. And I, an old woman, have also learned to embroider..." She laughed again and said: "That's all!" People said: "You spoke well!" Everyone cheered: "The front digs up the old roots and makes meritorious contributions, the rear plants rich roots and makes meritorious contributions. The front and the rear make meritorious contributions together, and together we will defeat Chiang Kai-shek!"

    Afterwards, the two large plaques, the music troupe, the masses, and the guests all divided into two groups, crowding around the doors of the two military families, watching the two large plaques being hung on top of the doors. The red silk covering them was removed, and the golden characters shone in the sunlight. The bright red commendation notices were posted on the wall. The people who participated in the celebration, like the military families, had radiant faces.

　　双喜进村
    仁庄村挂匾贺功速写
    束玉
    春耕下种完成的时候，黎城仁庄村为前方战士申福奇和张天才的家属贺功，申福奇是六○五○团的特等模范工作者；张天才是同一个团的三等模范工作者，两人的报功单同时寄回，仁庄村人人高兴，叫这是“双喜进村”。
    六月二日，仁庄全村群众给两家军属挂匾，炮声连响，鼓乐齐作。在匾、旗还有抬着的献礼的后面，拖着很长的队形，进村里去“夸功”。从城街穿过，轰动了赶集来的四方群众，长街塞巷，有人说像娶媳妇，可是娶媳妇没有见过这样排场。大家的眼睛都集中在两面黑油大匾上，给申福奇的写着“为民立功”，给张天才的写着“人民功臣”，于是人们都赞叹着说：“仁庄村作啥也要强，参了军的也给村上装光！”
    这时两个军属家里，忙着准备迎匾。两家两位老太太把好几天生出来的豆芽煮进锅里，把好几家亲戚送来的点心（即贴红点的大圆馍）放进笼里。福奇妈还催着她的大孩子安柱换上昨天才赶作成的白布衫，剃了一剃头。村上帮忙的妇女，不让他们亲自下手做饭，尽管督促她们换衣服，天才妈穿了一件长过膝盖的大青布衫（这件衣服曾经是老财家里的管家婆穿过的），头上包了一块白毛巾；福奇妈将拆洗过的棉袄改作成一干二净的夹衣，蒙了一块灰蓝布头巾，年青的媳妇们把她俩推出来，笑成一堆。邻居逢奇妈很习惯的向福奇妈斗笑：“比年青时，娶你还洋气哩！”福奇妈掩着嘴笑着说：“这是沾咱福儿的光！”帮忙筹办喜事的干部们说：“也是你擦屎擦尿，湿处倒干处，吃奶喂饭养活大的，没有你就有了他啦？”
    两个钟头过去了，到城里“夸功”的群众还没有回来，福奇家的新门楼下（这个砖包门楼是村上帮助盖成的），坐着他们的亲戚和村上帮忙的人，大家谈论起两家军属的家常来：“天才家是从武安逃荒上来的，在咱仁庄安了家。五年前，日本来扫荡时，他爹被鬼子杀死了，天才一怒气要参军报仇。那时村干部不叫他去，怕人说仁庄村扩军是捉弄外来户哩！可是他一直找到区上，报名参军走了！这孩子很争气，果然在前方立了功。”安柱插上口说：“咱家也一样受过罪，从前种人家地出了租就没有吃啦，俺爹在时，给人打了一辈子忙工。俺弟兄们还是光着屁股。自从那年倒了租，分了田，咱才有地种。福奇十五岁上就当了民兵，以后就当了区基干，以后就成了县基干，以后就成了正规军走了。今年才二十一岁，永不好回来一趟！村上优待咱很好，如今成了富中农啦！”
    村头响彻了炮声和鼓乐声，到城里“夸功”的人群回来了，仍然是几个年青的妇女，簇拥着两位老太太迎上前去。就在布置好的会场凉棚下举行贺功典礼。两位老太太并肩坐在迎席，其他军属烈属荣退军人等挨着坐在两头，来宾如边府、行署、县府、区工作员及邻村代表，分坐旁席。妇女和儿童争着给两位老太太献礼献花，多少人的眼，注视着她们，天才妈端端正正的望着，而福奇妈却仍笑着，眼眶里夹着热泪。天才妈心平气静的说：“俺天才在前边办好工作啦，我在家也光荣啦，村上人都辛苦啦，我要写信告俺天才说：“好好打胜仗，报答咱村上的恩情。”人们都高兴的鼓起掌来，福奇妈笑得抬不起头来，“咱不会说，也没甚说！”大家催她讲话，她才仰起脸来，沉了一沉气：“我说我很高兴，要不是俺福儿，咱还能盖起这砖包门楼，挂起这大匾？边府、行署、县政府，还有区上老王……。还能来给咱道喜？”笑了笑，继续沉着气讲下去：“俺福儿在前方立了功啦，俺安柱在家种地当互助组长，还帮助别家军属代耕哩，俺安奇在合作社，全脱离生产，为群众服务哩，我老人也学会绣花啦……”她又笑了一顿说：“没哪啦！”人们都说：“你讲得好！”大家欢呼：“前方刨老根立功，后方栽富根立功，前方后方齐立功，共同打败蒋介石！”
    随后两面大匾，音乐团和群众及来宾都分成两班，围挤在两家军属的门口，眼看着这两面大匾，挂在门顶上，揭去了上面的红绫，金黄色的大字，在阳光下，映射着光辉，大红色的报功单，贴在墙上，参加贺功的人们和军属一样，脸上都放着光彩。
