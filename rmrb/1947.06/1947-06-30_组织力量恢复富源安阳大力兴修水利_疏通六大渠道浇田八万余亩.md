　　[This report from our Anyang Bureau] The Anyang region is crisscrossed by canals, irrigating vast areas, with the Huan River, Zhang River, and Zhenzhu Spring in Shuiye as water sources. The county has six major canals, the largest being the Wanjin Canal (capable of irrigating over 100,000 mu of fields, with 40,500 mu in the liberated area), followed by the Datong Canal, Guangsui Canal, Guangji Canal, Minsheng Canal, and Fuxing Canal, which can collectively irrigate 81,324 mu of land within the liberated area. Each mu of land yields an average of five dou more than dry land, resulting in an annual increase of 40,662 shi of grain. Under the long-term rule of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, digging trenches and building fortresses destroyed most of the canals. Coupled with plunder and extortion, the masses were unable to afford repairs and dared not speak out. After Shuiye and other places were liberated again, the democratic government, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood and overcome the drought, immediately set about rectifying water conservancy. On June 4th, personnel were dispatched to various districts, villages, and canals to conduct investigations and research, and to fully organize the masses to repair banks and dredge canals. To reduce the burden on the masses, water conservancy loans of 1.1 million yuan were issued. Water conservancy associations were established for each canal to resolve disputes and universally irrigate the land for planting. On June 15th, the county government convened a meeting of the directors of the water conservancy associations of each canal to report on their work, discuss management and organization of dredging work, and formally established the County Water Conservancy Association. The current working principles were determined as follows: 1. Immediately dredge any individual obstructed areas in each canal to ensure sufficient water flow. 2. Upstream and downstream sections of each canal should quickly implement reasonable water distribution to maximize the irrigated area, watering day and night and planting day and night. 3. Organize and consolidate village organizations during the work process, forming irrigation mutual aid groups based on canals. At the same time, in their work, each comrade must be diligent in visiting and communicating, going deep into the grassroots to understand the situation, and resolving problems immediately to ensure that no arable land is left un-irrigated in any village.

    [This combined report from our bureaus] Under the urgent call to fight drought and prepare for famine, the counties of Taihang are fully mobilized to open canals, dig wells, and transform dry land into paddy fields, preparing for a long-term drought resistance. In the Second District of Xingtai, people are mobilizing from bottom-up and concentrating and expanding their drought resistance experience. After dispelling the masses' paralysis, Nan Dashu made concrete calculations and expanded the area irrigated by wells by one hundred and ten mu. By digging two more wells, they could irrigate thirty to forty more mu, and the remaining land would be planted by carrying water, greatly increasing the masses' confidence and motivating them to take action. The entire district has newly dug five river channels, with Changxin, Zhaicun, Zhangjiatun, and Jietun preceding Nanzhang Village, transforming sixty to seventy qing of dry land into paddy fields, doubling production. Villages with wells are repairing and deepening wells to expand the irrigated area. Luocun, Pangma, and other villages have expanded by more than eight hundred mu. Shi Village, Zhang Village, Luocun, and others have repaired one hundred and seventy-five waterwheels, irrigating 5,250 mu of dry land. The paddy fields have now all been planted with seedlings. The masses in Xitou Village, Licheng, led by Labor Hero Wang Xiande, are utilizing mountain stream water and underground aquifers to open canals, build water urns, and dig water ponds, using two hundred and ten labor days, opening seven water channels, and irrigating more than five hundred mu of land. They plan to dig fourteen more water ponds to water the remaining three hundred mu. Nearby villages are also learning this method of transforming nature and utilizing natural resources, actively opening canals for irrigation. In the Second District of Pingshun, twenty-seven administrative villages have launched a drought prevention upsurge, universally launching well-digging campaigns. In ten days, in conjunction with early seedlings, they deepened one hundred and forty-nine old wells and dug five new wells, and deepened twenty-eight old ponds. According to current statistics, in the villages of Wuxiang, over the past month or so, two thousand one hundred and twenty mu of dry land in the county have been transformed into paddy fields. Water conservancy committees have also been established to centrally lead each village and carry out water conservancy on a larger scale.

　　组织力量恢复富源安阳大力兴修水利
    疏通六大渠道浇田八万余亩
    【本报安阳讯】安阳境内渠道纵横，灌溉地区广大，以洹河、漳河及水冶之珍珠泉为水源，全县有六大渠道，最大的如万金渠（能浇田十万余亩，在解放区的有四○五○○亩），其次为大同渠、广遂渠、广剂渠、民生渠、复兴渠，在解放区内共能浇地八一三二四亩。每亩地比旱地平均增产五斗，全年可增产粮食四○六六二石。在蒋伪长期统治下，挖沟筑堡垒墙，大部渠道均遭破坏，加之掠夺勒索，群众无力兴修，敢怒而不敢言。此次水冶等地重获解放后，民主政府为安定人民生活战胜旱灾，即着手整顿水利。六月四日派人到各区各村各渠进行调查研究，全力组织群众修理设岸疏通渠道，为减轻群众负担，发放水利贷款一百一十万元，各渠道并设水利会，解决纠纷普遍浇地下种。六月十五日，县府召集各渠道水利会主任委员会议，汇报工作，座谈管理、组织疏通等工作经验，正式成立县水利会，决定当前工作方针：一、立即疏通各渠道个别不畅通的地方，加足水量。二、各渠上下游火速进行合理分水，尽量扩大浇地面积，昼夜浇水，昼夜下种。三、工作中进行各村组织的整理，以渠道为单位，成立浇地互助组。同时在工作上每个同志要腿勤嘴勤，深入下层了解情况，发现问题立时解决保证各村不荒一亩水地。
