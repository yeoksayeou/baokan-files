　　Overcoming the "Good Enough" Mentality
    County-wide Re-investigation in Gaoling
    [This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 5th] Cadres in the newly recovered Gaoling area overcame the landlord-sympathizing thought that after the disasters and enemy mopping-up operations, and after skimming off of floating wealth during the land reform, things were "good enough" and there was "nothing much to gain." In order to show the masses their determination to stick to their posts, they convened farmers' meetings of 70,000 people in late April. It was determined to resolutely follow the mass line and conduct re-investigations. At the meetings, district cadres swore oaths to the masses, demonstrating their determination to stand with the masses through thick and thin. The masses' enthusiasm was thus enlivened. Various villages volunteered, organizing assault teams and poor peasant re-investigation teams of 30-20 to 50-60 people to lead the masses in their work. After the masses returned to their villages, the skimming off of floating wealth and distribution of land immediately unfolded enthusiastically. In the Third District, at the Jingdian home of a landlord from whom much floating wealth had already been skimmed, another 17 shi of grain, and silver dollars and clothing worth several million yuan were dug up. In Dali Circle, the masses found 144 silver dollars and 296 strings of copper coins in the home of a landlord who had been struggled against. In addition, in some villages, the masses were afraid to break with the landlords and struggle against them, and said they had no grievances when they spoke out. Cadres went to investigate in depth and found that the internal organization was not clean. Therefore, while re-mobilizing and deliberating to make the masses realize that only by following the Communist Party and fighting the landlords to the end could they truly turn over, they also purged the "double insurance" and double-dealers within the farmers' association, and proposed the following rules: (1) Do not inform landlords or bad elements. (2) Do not hide or conceal fugitive landlords, their families, or their belongings. (3) Do not report information to landlords, and resolutely protect cadres and activists. District cadres made it clear that the leadership would resolutely support everyone, and collective oaths were taken. The masses were greatly mobilized. When the masses in Liuzhuang in the Second District cleared out Liu Wufu's floating wealth, they seized 50 bolts of white and colored cloth and 22 shi of grain in just one day. Li Xinke in Donghaitou Village colluded with the enemy and secretly hid the landlord's property. The masses seized more than ten shi of grain, three large cabinets of clothing, and a Hubei-made rifle. Statistics from eight villages in the First District showed that in two days they recovered 40 shi of wheat, 139 shi of miscellaneous grains, 650 shi of peanuts and dates, 26 carts, 44 head of livestock, and 50 bolts of cloth. There were also many other clothes and farm implements. At present, the re-investigation movement is continuing in various districts.
