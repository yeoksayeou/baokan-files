　　Our Army Enters Fenxi New District
    Masses Welcome Us on Both Sides of the Road
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 10th dispatch] Correspondent Ma Ming reports: On May 31st, this reporter followed the army eastward from Xiangning to the Fencheng plains, passing through more than twenty villages including Guanwangmiao and Guojiasaka, all of which were "soldier-peasant integration" areas under the long-term rule of Yan Xishan. Here, the Yan stubborn elements had fabricated rumors and slanders against the People's Liberation Army, such as saying we "kill, burn and loot". However, once the masses came into contact with the People's Army, they immediately experienced our army's good discipline, and all doubts quickly disappeared. They eagerly poured out their grievances to the Liberation Army and scrambled to lead the way for the troops, transporting grain and ammunition. They said, "How can you say anything bad about your own troops? When the Southern Army (referring to Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's troops) and the Old Army (referring to Yan Xishan's troops) come, the common people run away early." Liang Yuyin, an old man from Qingfenya Village, had his land "integrated" away after Yan stubbornly implemented "soldier-peasant integration," Liang Mingguang from Changping was seized to be a soldier, his wife died of anger, leaving only a young child and himself, with no means of living. When he heard that the Liberation Army was passing by, he was so happy that he couldn't sleep, saying, "The saviors have arrived! Now we can live!" He hurriedly lit a fire to boil water and invited us to eat. Xue Baixing, a young peasant from Guojiasaka Village, volunteered to lead the way, his mother and younger brother brought hot boiled water and steamed buns to the soldiers. When our army attacked the county seat, the masses from dozens of villages such as Sanguan, Nanxiangli, and Gucheng in Fencheng, all automatically put down their sickles and rushed to the front line to participate in the battle. When the Liberation Army marched out of the Sanguan Yuko area of the southern vein of the Lüliang Mountains, the boundless Jinnan plains were covered with wheat swaying in the wind, a golden expanse. The peasants and women cutting wheat all stopped their sickles to watch the majestic military appearance of the Liberation Army, their faces full of joy. People and animals carrying wheat brushed shoulders with the ranks of the Liberation Army, asking each other about the year's harvest. The Fenhe Plain south of Linfen, which is extremely rich in wheat production, is now under our control. Chiang's army, trapped in the isolated city of Linfen, will become starving corpses.

　　我军进入汾西新区
    群众夹道欢迎
    【新华社晋绥十日电】分社记者马明报导：上月三十一日记者随军从乡宁东向汾城平川，路经关王庙郭家坂等二十余村庄，均为阎锡山长期统治之“兵农合一”地区。在此，阎顽曾对解放军造谣诬蔑，如说：“杀人放火”等。但群众一经与人民军队接触，立即体验到我军纪律良好，各种怀疑很快冰释。纷纷向解放军倾吐冤苦，争先为部队带路，运输粮食弹药，他们说：“自家的部队怎也好说，南军（指蒋胡）、老军（指阎军）过来，老百姓早跑光了。”清峰崖村梁玉银老汉，自阎顽实行“兵农合一”后，土地被“合”走，长平梁明光被抓当兵，老婆气死，仅留小儿和他，生活无着。他听到解放军路过，高兴的睡不着觉说：“救星来了！这就能活了！”急忙生火烧水，招呼吃饭。郭家坂村青年农民薛百兴自动要求带路，他的母亲和小弟端着热腾腾的开水和馍馍，送到战士手中。汾城三官、南相李、古城等数十村群众，当我军攻打县城时，均自动放下镰刀赶上前线参战。当解放军走出吕梁山南脉的三官峪口一带，无际的晋南平川，遍地是随风荡漾的麦子，一片金黄。割麦的农民和妇女均停镰站观解放军的雄壮军容，喜形于色。驮麦人畜与解放军行列擦肩而过，互相问答年景收成。临汾以南为产麦极富的汾河平川，现均为我控制。困守临汾孤城蒋军，将成饿殍。
