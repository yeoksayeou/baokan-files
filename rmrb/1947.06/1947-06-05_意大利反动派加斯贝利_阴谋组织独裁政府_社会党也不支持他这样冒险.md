　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: TASS, Rome reports: Since May 23, Gasperi has held several talks with leaders of various parties, attempting to organize a "presidential" government. This kind of government is different from a parliamentary government, completely dependent on the will of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and not bound by collective responsibility. It would violate the basic principles of parliamentary democracy. After meeting with Gasperi, Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti issued a statement to reporters, saying: "In my opinion, there are no difficulties preventing the organization of a democratically centralized government with a broad and solid parliamentary base that can effectively manage the country. The presidential government that Gasperi wants to organize now is unnecessary in the current objective situation." Pietro Nenni (Socialist Party) issued a statement after meeting with Gasperi, denouncing Gasperi's anti-democratic behavior. He said: "I have told Gasperi that he cannot expect me or the Socialist Party to give him personal or political assistance. I told him without concealment that he is now choosing a dangerous path." The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" pointed out: The purpose of Gasperi's recent trick is to organize a government hostile to the working people. (Note: After the Gasperi cabinet resigned in mid-May, Italian President Niccolai immediately authorized Nitti to form a cabinet. Due to the obstruction and sabotage of the right-wing leaders of the Christian Democratic Party and reactionary factions, Nitti's cabinet formation was declared a failure; the Italian President then authorized Gasperi to form a cabinet.)

　　意大利反动派加斯贝利
    阴谋组织独裁政府
    社会党也不支持他这样冒险
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社罗马讯：自上月二十三日以来，加斯贝利数次与各党派领袖分别会谈，试行其组织“主席制”政府的企图。此种政府与议会政府不同，完全取决于部长会议主席之意志，不受集体负责的约束，会违反议会民主的基本原则而行事。意共领袖托格里亚蒂在和加斯贝利会谈后，对新闻记者发表声明略称：“依我看来，现在没有什么困难阻止组织有着广泛而稳固的议会基础，且能有效的管理国家的民主集中的政府。像现在加斯贝利所要组织的主席制政府，在目前客观形势中是没有必要的。”比埃特罗·尼格斯（社会党）和加斯贝利会谈后发表声明，痛斥加氏这种反民主的行为。他说：“我已经告诉加斯贝利，他不能期望我或社会党给他以个人的或政治的援助。我毫不隐讳告诉他说，他现在选了一条冒险的道路。”意共机关报“团结”报指出：加斯贝利最近诡计之目的，是组织一个敌视劳动人民的政府。（按：自上月中旬加斯贝利内阁提出辞职后，意总统尼科莱即授命尼蒂组织内阁，由于基督教民主党右翼领袖联合反动派多方阻挠破坏，尼蒂组阁宣告失败；意总统乃又授命加斯贝利组阁。）
