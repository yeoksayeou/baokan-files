　　Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Troops, Militia, and Work Teams
    Mobilize Together to Kill the Enemy and Protect the Harvest
    [Our Newspaper] On both sides of the Qin River in the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district, the armed struggle to protect the wheat harvest is fiercely unfolding. Local troops and militia work teams in various places, "holding guns in one hand and sickles in the other," combined with the masses to quickly harvest, quickly collect, and quickly hide the wheat, repeatedly dealing fatal blows to the Chiang Kai-shek/puppet troops, local bullies, and heads of returning counter-settlements. The Matun troops of the Fourth Military Sub-district implemented a combination of four major tasks: training soldiers, fighting battles, and publicizing the summer harvest. From May 16th to 26th, in ten days, they fought six battles against the enemy who came to loot wheat, capturing alive 31 people including the puppet district chief Mao Jiadao, and killing or wounding more than 30 people including Wang Hengchuan, the deputy of the Chiang Kai-shek's Jiaozuo City Self-Defense Force, seizing 24 rifles and 18 livestock, and striking at the arrogance of the stubborn puppets and local tyrants of Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi in seizing wheat. According to statistics, they had already harvested 213 mu of wheat in ten afternoons, carried water and splashed threshing grounds twenty-four times, and threshed ten fields. The Suntun troops, in three days from May 25th to 27th, won three consecutive victories, disrupting the enemy's plan to seize wheat. On the 25th, about 500 men from the Chiang Kai-shek's Xiuwu Security Regiment and others, attacked Wanhufu from Kongzhuang and Baizhuang in the north. The Suntun troops met them head-on and dealt a heavy blow, killing or wounding more than ten enemies, capturing one alive, and killing two local bullies. On the 26th, more than 600 enemies attacked again from Dongbanqiao, but were again defeated. On the afternoon of the 27th, the Suntun troops went south from Ligu, sweeping across Shuizhai Banqiao, capturing alive seven puppet self-defense team members and seven rifles, and capturing back more than 20 local bullies. The Yang Juhe Work Team, which is well-known in Jiaozuo, made great contributions again in protecting the wheat harvest. Combining cold shots and explosions, they killed or wounded seven enemy soldiers who were seizing wheat on May 27th. The Wuzhi Work Team's Fifth Detachment, on May 26th, combined with a part of the main force, repelled the wheat-grabbing traitors and local tyrants in the Pingling area, capturing alive 17 people including the puppet self-defense captain, and striking at the Chiang Kai-shek puppet’s plan to seize wheat deep in the hinterland. The masses in the hinterland also enthusiastically helped the masses in the border areas to harvest wheat, and on the 27th alone, they rushed to harvest more than 300 mu and transported all of it to the hinterland. On May 26th, the enemy from Huojia attacked along the south bank of the Dan River. The county's local troops had made preparations in advance. One unit of Wang, in coordination with the Eighth and Ninth Detachments, fought back, killing six enemies and capturing two alive, seizing five rifles and five pistols. Another unit of the enemy, about a hundred people, carrying small cannons and machine guns, attacked from Maying Bridge, but were blocked and repelled by more than ten militiamen from the Zhan Cheng Militia Team in Shizhuang District. Li Deji, the stubborn county magistrate of Qinyang, organized the targets of struggle gathered in the city, forcibly grabbed fifteen civilians from each street, formed a labor team of more than 400 people, carrying sickles and carrying poles, pushing carts, and on May 31st, led by Li Deji, went out of the city to seize wheat. Upon hearing the news, a unit of our ×× Regiment intercepted them at Xubao. Li Deji failed to seize any wheat, but was seriously injured and fled back to the city in a panic. This greatly suppressed the Chiang Kai-shek puppet's evil bullies who were seizing wheat. Commissioners Liu and Du of the Fourth Special Commissioner's Office sent a letter to the ×× Regiment to express their condolences and congratulate them on their victory.
