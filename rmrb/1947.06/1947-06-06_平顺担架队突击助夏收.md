　　【Ping Shun News from this Newspaper】The Pingshun stretcher teams' movement to cherish the people continues to deepen. The first and second squadrons arrived at Xugou Village in Qi County on the 19th night, with thirty to forty people helping the villagers to harvest wheat and thresh grain. The first brigade proposed: to act as propagandists for the masses, with each person propagandizing one member of the masses. In the "full jar movement", they carried more than a thousand loads of water for the masses, and also carried fertilizer, repaired houses, etc. Those who knew carpentry made seeders, spinning wheels, etc., achieving that everyone was occupied, doing what they knew how to do. The first and third brigades helped the masses harvest 59 mu of wheat in one day. Taking advantage of the gaps in the war, the entire team mobilized to launch a blitz on the summer harvest, pushing the movement to cherish the people to a climax.
    【Further News】When the Pingshun Militia Battalion recovered Qi County, militiamen from the second and third companies and cadres from the second and third districts of the county carried out the work of suppressing traitors and seeking revenge among the masses in Qianchang and other four villages. They took on the task of guarding and suppressing armed spies, and at the same time carried out work, constantly conducting propaganda, and inspiring the masses to fight bravely, resolutely struggling against the traitor leader Guan Laoniu and others, seizing 54 rifles, 5 pistols, and ammunition, etc., and emerging activists such as Guan Huangmao and Zhang Zichun and 55 others. They helped the masses to turn themselves around everywhere, receiving the warm support of the masses. (Zhiqing, Shuangxi, Xuekong, Qiufang, Chengxian)
