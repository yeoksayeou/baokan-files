　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 2nd: On the Siping front, a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Xifeng County yesterday (the 1st). The defending Chiang troops fled south, and the Democratic Allied Army is pursuing them. Note: This city was invaded by the Chiang army’s New 6th Army in mid-May of last year and was recovered by our forces once in early October, where five battalions of the Chiang army’s New 6th Army 207th Division were annihilated.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 3rd: On the Siping front, in the battle to capture Changtu, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army completely annihilated the remnants of the Chiang army's 71st Army and over 4,000 security team members led by the Chiang-appointed four exiled county magistrates near the city. During the attack on the city, one squad of the 3rd Company, 10th Battalion of the Provisional 3rd Division, which was defending the Ghost King Temple in the southwest corner of the city, surrendered to the Democratic Allied Army with one machine gun.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 3rd: After the Democratic Allied Army recovered Changtu, the local masses rose up to accuse Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule. It is reported that all able-bodied men in the area between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five were forcibly conscripted into the army by the Chiang government in stages. Those who had money to buy their way out were extorted 300,000 yuan per person. Moreover, they were forced to buy grain at low prices. For example, the market price of sorghum rice was 3,500 yuan per斗(dǒu), while the official purchase price was set at 260 yuan, causing extreme suffering to the masses. The Democratic Allied Army is now distributing all 4,000 shi (equivalent to 2 million jin) of military grain seized by the Chiang army at Changtu Station to the masses.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 3rd: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army and other units persisting behind the Chiang lines on the Liaodong Peninsula have been victorious in successive battles. On the 26th of last month, they recovered the Chiang bandit stronghold of Dangpu Street, west of Zhuanghe, and routed a battalion of the 26th Regiment of the Chiang bandit Independent 9th Division (composed of Northeastern bandits reorganized by Chiang Kai-shek), annihilating over a hundred of them and seizing one heavy machine gun, one light machine gun, and forty rifles. On the 27th, the same unit routed parts of the Chiang army's New 6th Army 14th Division and the Chiang bandit Independent 9th Division in Baijiatun, northwest of Zhuanghe, killing or wounding over a hundred Chiang bandits, capturing over one hundred and fifty alive, and seizing one mortar, one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, over a hundred rifles, and one jeep.

    【新华社东北前线二日急电】四平方面，东北民主联军一部，于昨日（一日）收复西丰县城，守城蒋军向南逃窜，民主联军正跟踪追击。按：该城去年五月中旬为蒋军新六军侵陷，十月初为我一度收复，并在此歼灭蒋军新六军二○七师五个营。
