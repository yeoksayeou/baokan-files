　　Anyang Jiangying Yarn Factory
　　The Blood and Tears of Female Workers

　　Open the Guangyu Yarn Factory and rescue us suffering workers!
　　Protect the machines and increase the wealth of our liberated area's people!
　　Our certain unit, encouraged by these clear slogans, after a bloody battle, finally liberated this blood-sucking den north of Anyang City.
　　As soon as the workers saw the Eighth Route Army rushing in, they crawled out from the cellars, boiler rooms, and under all kinds of machines. They had been driven out of their dormitories by the Jiang army and hidden in these places for a full half month. Now, carrying the young, supporting the old, with broken cloth and tattered batting in their arms, and faces full of grime, they returned to their dormitories like groups of refugees.
　　The female workers, with surprised expressions, surrounded me, staring with tired, lifeless eyes, listening to me explain the simple principles of the Eighth Route Army rescuing the workers. The children's hungry cries were disruptive, but they still listened attentively, some plugging the dry, milkless nipples into their children's mouths. When I sincerely comforted them, they cried with gratitude. An old female worker with completely white hair grabbed my arm, as if she wanted to kneel down. I immediately helped her up. She twitched her toothless, flat mouth, trembling as she said:
　　"Once a person enters the factory, it's like entering a living hell, cut off from the outside world. I've been a fine yarn worker for thirty-six years, spending my whole life in the factory, and no one has ever asked me if I was hungry or cold. It's not as good as a dog lying under the table of the factory's gentlemen and bosses. I never thought that at seventy years old, I'd meet an official like you who would come and see us!"
　　A middle-aged female worker, Zhang ××, pointed at the old female worker and said to me:
　　"Comrade, she was just a young daughter-in-law when she entered the factory. Decades of days without sun, nights without sleep, look what it's turned her into!"
　　"If it weren't for you surrounding the factory so tightly these days, they would have pushed me, the old woman, out long ago." The old female worker burst into tears. She grabbed me even tighter and said, "The factory thinks I'm old and useless, and won't let me work anymore. They told me to move out of the factory. But think about it, I'm alone, with no relatives to rely on, not even a daughter. Where can I go?"
　　"There are many of us who have been workers for generations, but in the end, when we're old and dying, we're still empty-handed. No one cares, no one asks, and many can't even afford a thin coffin!" another old female worker added.
　　One sallow face after another, with deep-set eyes, were all stirred up. They talked more and more closely to me, warmly crowding around and grabbing my hand. I helped Li ××, who was carrying three children, pick up one of the children and went with them to their living area.
　　In the low, narrow dormitories, which were like coal ash caves, the floor was piled with smashed doors and windows and broken pots and bowls, so that it was almost impossible to find a place to put your feet. We sat down on this pile of debris. Looking at this scene of desolation, I asked them, "Where are the people from the factory?"
　　"The people from the factory? The gentlemen and bosses all took the plane with the Kuomintang officials long ago. The junior staff who could flee also fled into the city. Who cares about us poor workers!"
　　Zhang ×× said:
　　"It's not about whether they run or not. The yarn factory has never been without troops. When the old days left, Old Chiang's army replaced them. Wasn't it the factory's gentlemen and bosses who ordered us to vacate our houses for them? Didn't they call Ai Mei and a few other young girls to let the officers of the Chiang army abuse them at will? As for the soldiers, there's no need to mention them. Whoever they ran into was unlucky."
　　A female worker with long hair, tousled like weeds, was reminded of the pain of being raped when she was fifteen. She cried, holding her head, and everyone comforted her, saying:
　　"Silly child, what's the use of crying? As long as you're sold into the factory, how many of you at this age can they let go through cleanly?"
　　"How were you sold into the factory?" I asked, not understanding.
　　"Once your name is on the factory register, you're no longer free. All year round, we're in the workshop, never seeing the sun. We even eat our meals sitting next to the machines. Once they put this piece of cloth (worker's ID) on your chest, it's like a nail hammered into you. Even if your own daughters and sons come to see you, they can only say a few words and shed a few tears in the gatehouse. What's the difference between this and being sold?"
　　Old female worker Wang Li Shi said:
　　"I always say that we workers are beggars, just without the crying and shouting at people's doors. Even with the best skills, we can only earn a few dozen catties of wheat a month, not enough to support two people, and we suffer even more abuse than beggars!"
　　As they spoke, two female workers helped a female worker who had just given birth a few days ago return. I asked them if the factory had any regulations for pregnant women and new mothers regarding rest and treatment. Because they had never heard of such a thing, they complained to me:
　　"The factory's rule is like this: if you can't work for a day, they deduct a day's wages, regardless of whether you're sick or giving birth. If you're absent for too many days, they'll fire you."
　　I took the opportunity to introduce them to the labor policies of the liberated areas, how pregnant female workers are treated preferentially, and how they are given appropriate rest and paid their wages during the production period. They were all entranced as if listening to a fairy tale. Wang Gao Hua, after hearing me speak about the system of protecting child labor, touched the head of her twelve-year-old daughter, Gui Zi, and said:
　　"Child, when you had a headache and fell from the machine, the supervisor wouldn't even let you come out and rest for a while. Listen to what this comrade is saying, it would be so good if we could be like that too!"
　　The child in my arms started to cry. He was already over two years old, but his crying was unusually weak. In his particularly thin throat, it sounded like a bellows, wheezing and gasping. Many of the children around were like this. The mothers told me that when they went to work, day or night, they often carried their children on their backs, enduring the long twelve hours. The long-term life in the machine room, filled with the dirty air of cotton fibers, not only eroded the lungs of the mothers but also eroded the children.
　　They poured out a lot of grievances to me, one sentence after another. Because of the exploitation they had personally suffered, it was easy to arouse their class hatred. Zhang ×× said:
　　"Look at us, big and small, who has any color in their face, who looks like a person?"
　　I explained to them: The workers' blood has all been sucked away by Chiang Kai-shek and the factory owners under him. The Eighth Route Army is going to defeat Boss Chiang and rescue the workers.
　　"No wonder some people say that when the Eighth Route Army's cannons arrive, the world there will change greatly." Old female worker Wang Li Shi said with tears in her eyes.
　　I stood up excitedly and called on everyone:
　　"The Eighth Route Army will help you organize well. You must actively sign up and join the trade union to take revenge on the enemies who have sucked our blood and sweat!"
　　For the first time, they felt that their lives were guaranteed and that there was a way out of life. A light of hope flashed in their eyes.

　　安阳蒋营纱厂
    女工们的血泪话
    曾克
    打开广裕纱厂，解救我们受苦难的工人！
    保护机器，增加我们解放区人民的财富！
    我们的某部队，在这鲜明口号的鼓舞下，经过浴血的战斗，终于把安阳城北这个吸血窟解放了。
    工人们一看见八路军冲进来，就从地洞里，锅炉房中，和各种机器底下爬出来。他们被蒋军从宿舍里赶出来，窝藏在这些地方，足足的有半个月了。现在，他们背着小的，扶着老的，胳膊里夹着破布烂絮，满脸油污，一群群流民似的，回到自己的宿舍去。
    女工们带着惊奇的神色把我围起来，瞪着疲倦无神的眼睛，听我向她们讲解八路军解救工人的简单道理。孩子们饥饿的哭闹搅扰着，但是她们仍聚精会神地听，有的把干瘪的没有奶汁的奶头，塞住孩子的嘴。当我诚恳的慰问她们的时候，她们感激得哭了。一个头发全白的老女工，一把抓住我的胳膊，像是要跪下来的样子，我立刻把她搀扶着，她疮痊的抽搐着那没有牙齿扁嘴巴，抖颤的说：
    “人一进了工厂，就是钻了活地狱，跟外面世界一刀两断了。我当了三十六年的细纱工人，一辈子在工厂里，没有一个人来问过一声饥寒饱暖。不如人家厂里大人先生们桌子底下卧的一条狗。想不到，七十岁啦，遇到你这当官的来看看！”
    中年女工张××指着老女工对我说：
    “同志，她进工厂的时候，还是个年轻轻的小媳妇，几十年没天没日，没日没夜的日子，看看把人磨成个啥样啦！”
    “要不是这些天，你们把厂子围的紧紧的，顾不上，他们早把我老婆子推出去了。老女工放声哭起来。她更紧的抓住我说：“厂里嫌我老了，不中用了，不叫我再上工，叫我搬出厂去。你们想，我一个无亲无靠的人，连个闺女都没有，我上那去呢？”
    “俺们几辈子几辈子干工人的多得很，可是，临老临死还是个白手空大空。没人管没人问，连个薄皮棺材混不上的多得很哪”！另一个老女工接上来说。
    一张张菜色的脸孔，露着个深陷的大眼睛，都被激动起来了。她们越谈越靠近我，亲热的挤上来拉我的手。我帮助一个带三个孩孩的李××，抱起一个孩子，一同到她们的住区去了。
    一间间低矮窄狭，煤灰洞一般的宿舍，满地都堆着被捣毁的门窗和砸碎的锅碗，简直扒不出一个下脚的地方。我们就在这破烂堆上坐下来。看着这一片惨景，我问她们：“厂里的人呢？”
    “厂里人？先生师们爷老早就坐飞机跟中央军当官的跑了，底下的小职员，能窜的也都窜到城里去了。还管俺们这些穷工人！”
    张××说：
    “不在他们跑不跑，纱厂里没断住过队伍，老日子走了，就换上老蒋的军队。不是厂里的先生师爷下命令叫咱给人家腾房子？不是他们把爱梅她们几个小闺女叫去，叫老日子跟遭殃军当官的随意糟踢？当兵的那就不用提啦，碰着谁谁倒霉。”
    一个蓬松着像乱草一样长头发的女工，触起了她十五岁时被奸污的创痛，她抱着头哭了，大家对她劝慰着说：
    “傻孩子，哭顶什么用？只要卖到人家厂里，像你们这大年纪，有几个他们能叫你清清白白的过去呀？”
    “怎么你们是卖进工厂里来的？”我不懂的问。
    “在工厂里一上了名，就再也不自由了。一年到头，两头不见太阳的在工房里，吃饭都是坐在机子旁边吃的。胸口上给你缀上这块布（工人证）就算钉子钉到这啦，亲生的闺女、儿子来看，也只能在门房里说几句话，掉几滴眼泪，这跟卖出去还有啥两样？”
    老女工王李氏说：
    “我整天不就说，俺工人就是要饭花子，就差个不在人家门上哭哭喊喊的。一个月，顶高的手艺，才能吃上人家几十斤麦子，养活不住两口子，受的气可比要饭花子还多！”
    谈到这里，有两个女工扶着一个刚生产不几天的女工回来。我问到她们厂里对孕妇及产妇有没有什么规定的休息和待遇？她们因为从没听到遇有这么会事，还是诉苦般的对我说：
    “人家的规矩就是这样：你一天不能上工，就扣你一天工钱，管你是什么有病生娃娃，不上工的天数多啦，就要把你辞退。”
    我趁机会给她们介绍解放区的工人政策，如何优待怀孕的女工，生产期间如何给于适当的休息并照发工资，她们像听神话一般都出神了。王高化听了我说的保护童工的制度，摸着她十二岁的闺女桂子的头说：
    “孩，你头疼的从机子摔下来，人家监工的都不叫你出来歇一下透口气。听听这个同志说的，咱这，要也成了这样可就好啦！”
    抱在我怀里的孩子哭起来了，他已经两周岁多，哭声却异常的微弱。他的特别显得细长的喉管里，像响着风箱一般，呼噜呼噜的直喘气。周围很多小孩子都是这样。母亲们对我讲，她们去上工，不论日夜，常常是把孩子背在背上，熬过十二小时的漫长时间。长期的机房生活，飞满着棉花纤维的污秽空气，不仅侵蚀了母亲的肺管，也同样侵蚀了孩子们。
    她们你一句我一句又对我倒了很多辛酸。由于她们亲身所受的剥削，很容易激起她们阶级的仇恨。张××说：
    “看看俺们大大小小那一个有一分血色，那一个像个人？”
    我给他们解释：工人的血都吸到蒋介石和他手下的工厂老板们身上去了，八路军就是要打垮蒋老板，解救工人们的。
    “怪不得有人说，八路军的大炮（厶）到那，那里的世道就要大变。”老女工王李氏流着眼泪说。
    我兴奋的站起来，向大家号召：
    “八路军会很好的帮助你们组织起来，你们要积极的上名，参加工会，向吸干我们血汗的敌人报仇！”
    她们第一次觉得生命有了保障，生活有了出路。眼里闪出希望的光辉。
