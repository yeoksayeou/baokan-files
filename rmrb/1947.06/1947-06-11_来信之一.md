　　Literary Federation of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region:

　　I suggest that our border region should publish two small journals: one for drama and one for music, like the small-scale publications of the Shandong Literary Association, "Drama" and "Youth Songs."

　　Our border region has so many rural troupes and county troupes, and they have a lot of creations. I hope they can be revised and published; they have many valuable creations, and also many problems that need to be solved and studied. This small journal is exactly their garden. The publication of this drama journal can prevent the various troupes from doing their own thing and being unconnected.

　　Regarding music, some have been published in literary magazines and "Northern Magazine," but it's too little and not suitable for the cultural level of the peasants. Peasants need more popular creations, and they themselves have created many popular lyrics. The vast number of music workers have no guidance, and finding a music book is either Western dogma, or they are groping on their own. Publishing a journal would serve as an introduction to these creations and individual work experiences.

　　These two journals will definitely have a great effect on the development of artistic work. In terms of its content, I think it should be like this: ——

　　The music journal can publish: folk song introductions, folk song research, notation and research of old operas, experience in staging operas, playing methods of common musical instruments, vocal music knowledge, basic music theory, composing experience, musical movement and information, musical instrument manufacturing methods, musician introductions, how to teach the masses to sing, mass singing, characteristics of old opera singing methods, characteristics of Chinese melodies, song creation...

　　The drama journal can publish: rural troupe creations, play introductions, stage knowledge, how to write plays, how to direct, how to do makeup, how to perform, drama movement and information, gains from staging a certain play, the experiences of reformed old opera performers, typical reports.

　　Drama direction issues (such as whether Lin County is right in not allowing old operas to be performed?) are all issues worth studying. ………

　　Now the common feeling among the various troupes is that there are no scripts, but in reality, it's not that there aren't any, but rather that they don't reach their hands. If there are these two kinds of journals, drama and music workers will each have a copy in hand, reading each issue, exchanging experiences with each other, then drama work and the music movement will definitely improve quickly, and it will not cause each worker to complain about having no scripts or folk songs.

　　来信之一

    晋冀鲁豫边区文联：
    我建议咱们边区应当出两个小型刊物：一个是戏剧的，一个是音乐的，就像山东文协出的戏剧和青年歌声那样小型的东西。
    我们边区这么多的农村剧团，县剧团，他们有很多的创作，希望给修改一下，登载出来；他们有许多宝贵的创造，也有许多问题须要解决须要研究，那么这个小刊物正是他们的园地了。这个戏剧刊物的出版，可以使各个剧团不至于再各自干各自的，互不关联了。
    关于音乐，在文艺杂志、北方杂志上也载了一些，但是太少，而且不适合农民的文化程度，农民需要更通俗的创造，而他们自己也创作了许多通俗的歌词。广大的音乐工作者，没有人指导，找到一本音乐籍也是西洋的教条，也是各自摸索，我们出一个刊物就作为这些创作和各人工作经验的介绍。
    这两个刊物对于艺术工作的发展一定会起很大的效果，在他的内容方面我觉得是这样：——
    音乐的可以登载：民歌介绍，民歌研究，旧剧的记谱与研究，排演歌剧的经验，普通乐器的演奏法，声乐常识，初步的乐理，作曲的经验，音运、音讯、乐器制造法，音乐家介绍，怎样教群众歌子，群众的歌唱，旧剧唱法的特点，中国旋律的特点，歌曲的创作……。
    戏剧的可以登载：农村剧团创作，剧本介绍，舞台常识，怎样编剧，怎样导演，怎样化装，怎样表演，剧运、剧讯、排演某一剧的收获，改造的旧剧人的经过，典型报告。
    戏剧方向问题（如林县不准演旧剧，对不对？）都是值得研究的问题。…………
    现在各个剧团的共同的感觉没有剧本，实际并不是没有，而是到不到他手里，假若有了这两种刊物，剧音工作者每人手备一册，期期阅读，互相交流了经验，那么戏剧工作，音乐运动一定能很快的提高，也不会使各个工作者叫苦无剧本，无民歌。（下略）
