　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the United Nations Palestine Inquiry Committee, formed under the manipulation of the United States and Britain, has been boycotted by Palestinian Arabs before it even began its work. At the United Nations Special Assembly last month, due to the manipulation of the meeting by the US and Britain, the Arab countries' request to discuss Palestine's independence was rejected, and a Palestine Inquiry Committee composed of eleven countries, chaired by Swiss representative Mr. Martens-Thomson, was organized. The committee flew to Jerusalem on the 15th. Upon arrival, "terrorists" threw smoke bombs in three locations to express their dissatisfaction. The Palestinian Arab Higher Committee has resolved that all Arabs will hold a comprehensive general strike on the 16th, students will boycott classes, shops will close, and civil servants will cease work to protest this investigation, which is not conducive to Palestine's independence. Arab countries in the Middle East will also support this. Mr. Goley, the chief representative of the former Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations Special Assembly, declared that there have been eighteen such useless investigations since the First World War. The Arabs are determined to make Palestine an independent nation and are unwilling to make any minor changes. He also said, "We are determined to end British rule through peaceful or warlike means."

　　巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高委会
    决议罢工罢课罢市
    抵制美英操纵的调委会
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：美英操纵下所组成之联合国巴勒斯坦调查委员会，未开始工作即遭巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人之抵制。上月联合国特别大会中由于美英操纵会议的结果，否决了阿拉伯国家所提讨论巴勒坦独立之要求，而组织了一个包括十一个国家由瑞士代表木林特斯托姆任主席的巴勒斯坦调查委员会。该委员会已于十五日飞至耶路撒冷，刚抵达，即有“恐怖分子”于三处投掷烟幕弹，以示不满。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高级委员会并决议：所有阿拉伯人于十六日举行全面总罢工、学生罢课、商店停业、公务员停止工作，以抗议此种无益于巴勒斯坦独立的调查。中东各阿拉伯国家亦将予以支持。前阿拉伯高级委员会派赴联合国特别大会之首席代表高莱宣称：此种无用之调查，自第一次大战以来，已曾有过十八次。阿拉伯人决定使巴勒斯坦成为一独立国家一事，不愿作任何细微更改。并谓：“吾人已决心借和平或战争方式结束英国之委任统治。”
