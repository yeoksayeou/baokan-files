　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Northern Henan] The Cixian Headquarters, in order to further promote the "Love the People" movement ideologically, and to inspire and motivate the stretcher-bearer militia's enthusiasm and initiative in the "Love the People" movement, conducted a preliminary summary and commendation of everyone's achievements on May 26th. After encouraging everyone and boosting their production enthusiasm, it put forward a call to help the local masses with the harvest rush based on the current specific situation. Under the slogan "Strive for merit in the harvest rush, and those who are models will have their merit added to," all stretcher-bearer militia enthusiastically responded to this call. Each district team formulated its own plan to launch a "one mu per person" movement. Under the influence of cadres taking the lead and working with their own hands, the harvest rush movement was widely launched in more than ten villages including Luogou, Fanzhuang, Buluo, and Beizhangjiao. Everyone's enthusiasm was extremely high. Challenge competitions were carried out in all stretcher-bearer teams and militia. From the 29th to the 31st, one thousand militiamen and stretcher-bearers helped the masses rush to harvest more than 4,500 mu of wheat, threshing ten threshing grounds, with a total of 3,023 workdays. In the upsurge of the harvest rush, many model figures emerged. For example, Comrade Jin Xiang, the deputy company commander of the first company of the militia brigade, led three militiamen and helped the masses cut sixteen mu of wheat in one day, an average of four mu per person. His model action promoted and educated everyone. Another example is Comrade Li Dafu from the second district team, who cut wheat the fastest in the harvest rush, and one person did the work of two. In Fanzhuang Village, Fan Changxun was a poor farmer with no labor or livestock, and he had no way to get the harvested wheat home. After Comrade Song Youhe of the third district team learned of his difficulties, he organized six stretcher-bearers to completely haul back six mu of wheat for him with a cart in half a day, and also helped poor households without labor with hauling and threshing. The cooks actively brought boiling water to the fields for the stretcher-bearers and helped the masses chop firewood and sell it, saving civilian labor. Under the influence of losing the rake and taking the broom, and working hard to help the local masses with production, the relationship between the stretcher-bearer team and the local masses became closer, just like their own people. Old man Song Jinhuai of Beizhangjiao Village said: "You are really good. You smile when you speak, and you don't want money for your work. You can stay in our village for three years without feeling troubled." Some of the masses sent vegetables and cigarettes to the stretcher-bearers and militia, and sometimes even shared their innermost thoughts. When helping the masses in other villages cut wheat, they even sent food to the fields. After our stretcher-bearer team repeatedly refused, they said: "You don't earn money! You don't even eat! We really can't bear it in our hearts. We feel happy even if you drink a sip of our water." Now our entire militia and stretcher-bearer harvest rush work is about to be completed victoriously, and some have already turned to helping the masses thresh the wheat roots and carrying water to plant seeds.

　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Northern Henan] Actively responding to the Logistics Headquarters' call to "Help the Masses with the Harvest Rush," the stretcher-bearer teams of Huixian and Linxian Counties, and the Shexian Liaison Station, are all working enthusiastically. The 160 stretcher-bearers of the third district of Linxian rushed to harvest 139 mu of wheat in Houzhuang in one day. On the 29th of last month, the militia communications squad of the Shexian Rear Liaison Station also helped the villagers in the stationed village with harvesting. After proper division of labor by the cadres of the Huixian stretcher-bearer team, in addition to leaving 20 stretchers with the army to persist in their work every day, the remaining 400 people were all drawn out to help the masses in Chexianghe and Shentou areas of Jixian County with harvesting, and they cut and threshed 220 mu in three days.

　　磁县担架民兵人人争模范
    三天助收四千余亩
    辉县林县涉县担架积极参加抢收
    【本报豫北讯】磁县指挥部为了更进一步的把民爱民运动在思想上推进一步，启发鼓动担架民兵，在爱民运动中的热情与积极性，于五月二十六号进行了初步总结、表扬了大家的成绩，勉励了大家，鼓舞了大家的生产情绪后，又跟据当前的具体情况，提出了帮助驻地群众的抢收号召。在“抢收中争取立功，模范者功上加功”的口号下，全体担架民兵都热烈的响应了这一号召，各区队自订计划展开了一亩地运动，在干部以身作则亲自动手的影响下，抢收运动在罗勾、樊庄、布洛、北张角等十余个村庄普遍展开，大家情绪极度高涨，担架队与民兵中全面开展了挑战竞赛，二十九号至卅一号三天中一千个民兵担架队员，帮助群众抢收麦子四千五百余亩，打场十个，总用工三千零二十三个。在抢收的热潮中，涌现出许许多多模范人物，如民兵大队第一连副连长靳香同志，带领了三个民兵，一天中帮助群众割麦十六亩，每人平均四亩。在他这样的模范行动中，推动教育了大家。又如二区队李大付同志，在抢收中割麦子最快，一个人顶两个人干活。樊庄村有一个范常循是个贫苦农民、没有劳力、没有牲口、麦子割起来没办法往家里闹；三区队宋有合同志了解了他的困难后，就组织了六个担架队员，一晌光景用大车给他把六亩麦子完全拉回来，还帮助没劳力的贫户拉场、打场。炊事员同志在积极的行动中给担架往地里送开水，帮助群众砍柴卖柴，节省了民力。这些模范作风，在抢收中是起了骨干作用的。丢了筢子拿扫帚、吃苦耐劳帮助驻地群众生产的影响下，担架队与驻地群众关系更加密切，都和自己人一样，北张角村宋金怀老汉说：“你们真是好，说话一面笑，做活不要钱，在我村驻上三年也不闲麻烦。”有的群众给担架、民兵送菜吃、送烟吸，有时还扯扯自己的知心话。在帮助外村群众割麦时，还给往地里送饭，在我们担架队的一再拒绝下，他们说：“你们不挣钱吧！连饭也不吃！我们心眼里实在下不去，你们喝我一口水也觉得痛快。”现在我们全体民兵、担架抢收工作将要胜利完成，一部分已转入帮助群众打场小麦根，担水点种。（马骏）
    【本报豫北讯】积极响应后勤指挥部“帮助群众抢收”号召，辉、林各县担架队、涉县联络站，都热烈的干起来。林县三区担架一百六十人，在侯庄一天内抢收小麦一百三十九亩。涉县后方联络站，民兵通信班子上月二十九日也帮助驻村群众收割。辉县担架队经干部适当分工，每天除留二十付担架随军坚持工作外，其余四百人全部抽出帮助汲县车香河、神头一带群众收割，三天内连割带打二百二十亩。（文珊）
