Meritorious Service Clarifies the Path
    Recording the Ideological Changes of Geng Lanyu of Shengfotang

    The policy of eliminating landlords was conveyed to Shengfotang last summer. From the moment Geng Lanyu heard about it, he eagerly anticipated the struggle, often saying, "Suffering is all because of the landlords. Eliminate the landlords and we'll never suffer again."

    Before the struggle even began, the call for opening up democracy was made. Lanyu thought, "If shortcomings aren't overcome, can the masses be satisfied? If the masses don't rise up, can the landlords be eliminated?" So he actively led the village cadres in self-reflection, asking the masses for their opinions. During the conscription work, he offended his own aunt, supporting the entire village alone. The task weighed him down, but instead of being commended, he was criticized for "poor attitude." Zhang Jinbang, who used to shirk work, even accused him of "forcing him to deliver letters." These weren't really Lanyu's shortcomings, and nobody could understand it. But he thought, "If the masses' suggestions are right, it's our clear path. If they're wrong, we'll accept them to eliminate the landlords, so as not to dampen the masses' enthusiasm."

    After democratic feedback, Lanyu's enthusiasm for eliminating the landlords didn't diminish in the slightest. He had things to do from the moment he opened his eyes until late at night. He never had a proper hot meal, and if he didn't have dry food, he'd use cattle feed as a substitute. He lent grain to the members who didn't have any, willing to save himself so as not to affect the members' enthusiasm. In this way, he gave away over two hundred *jin* of grain. In two months, the landlords were eliminated, and the fruits were distributed fairly. Everyone in the village praised Lanyu as capable, fair, and honest, with a good disposition.

    A puddle of water has both deep and shallow parts, and among cadres, there are both backward and exemplary ones. Lanyu was too proactive in Shengfotang, but he had a muddled understanding of backward cadres. He criticized his own brother, who was a committee member, for being backward. He only focused on this aspect, but didn't understand patiently persuading and helping them to progress. He said, "Everyone is born an individual, and they should do what they're supposed to do!"

    At the end of the movement, some backward cadres said, "The big cadres are all in the west, and the landlords in the west are struggled against lightly." Some new rich middle peasants who had become village cadres got very little fruits and said behind his back, "Killing people only gets you blood on your hands. The woodpecker sleeps with the night owl; it has eyes to stay up, but no bugs to eat." When Lanyu heard this, he immediately got angry. "Everything was discussed by our entire peasant association. Who doesn't know we treat everyone equally? Now it's big cadres, small cadres, light, heavy. I'm also a new middle peasant and didn't get any fruits. My wife complains about it all day long because of that." Lanyu only grumbled to himself. He wasn't satisfied with the backward village cadres, nor was he satisfied with himself. Perhaps they're more experienced, and they can do a better job than me? So he decided to "push it to them to do it."

    Lanyu was determined to resign from the position of chairman of the peasant association. "Rashness, temper, dissatisfaction with backwardness, feeling unqualified" clouded his mind. He desperately wanted to find a way to push the role to the person in the east who talked idly. He didn't rely on the leadership, nor did he rely on the cadres. He personally went to the masses to mobilize them. During the election, he and Yongzhen cast a few extra bean grains, achieving his goal. From resigning as chairman, he stopped speaking at meetings and focused on farming his own land, gradually distancing himself from the masses. From then on, the village's work declined day by day. But Lanyu was ultimately an excellent peasant who had been completely transformed by the Communist Party, a leader who enthusiastically served the masses. He could never forget the Communist Party, the revolution, or the masses. Seeing that the village's work was getting worse and worse, he felt a serious pang of conscience. He asked himself, "Turning yourself around and then retreating home, what kind of revolution is that?" He also thought, "If the superiors know I resigned, that's one thing, but if they don't know, they'll think I'm responsible for not doing a good job."

    At this time, the meritorious service movement spread to Shengfotang. He said, "Just had democracy and now reporting merits. In the past, whether good or bad, we all broke up. Those who are backward still won't do anything." When he was mobilized to report his merits, he said, "Running errands and doing small things isn't a merit. People who are eloquent and qualified have merits." Therefore, the meritorious service didn't shake him. He thought that even if there were merits, wouldn't it be for nothing when the cadres left? What's the point of evaluating that! So most of the time, Geng Sicheng helped him report his merits. After the cadres and masses evaluated them, his contributions were not erased at all. He was listed as a first-class meritorious person, and the merits of everyone in the village, big and small, were evaluated clearly. This was like a fresh breeze, awakening Lanyu and awakening all the village cadres and masses. He shaved his long hair that he hadn't cut for two months, and a smile appeared on his face. He joked around when he saw people on the street. People said, "Lanyu is lively again."

    Seeing that Geng Quande was rated as a second-class meritorious person and volunteered to provide a stretcher this time made him even more excited. He said, "If you can get the masses to rise up, it will be easy to do any work." He wanted to add merit upon merit and deeply reflected on himself: "I made a big mistake and went down the wrong path. First, I resigned from the position of chairman, failing to lead the masses in production. Second, I hindered all the work of the superiors from proceeding, and these are all losses to the revolution." At the same time, he also realized that "Rashness cannot achieve anything. If you want to do a good job, you must patiently help backward cadres and the masses progress." Now he has been elected as the vice chairman of the joint association. He said, "Meritorious service has clarified the path. In the future, I will set an example for everyone to follow."

### 立功把路弄明了  记圣佛堂耿兰玉的思想变化

　　立功把路弄明了
    记圣佛堂耿兰玉的思想变化
    消灭地主的政策，从去年夏天就传到了圣佛堂，耿兰玉从听到后就天天盼着斗争，他常说：“受罪都是有地主的过，消灭了地主永远不受罪”。
    斗争还没开始，又提出了开放民主，兰玉想“有缺点不克服群众还能满意，群众不起来还能消灭地主？”于是他积极领导村干反省，叫群众提意见。在参军工作中他得罪了亲姑，一人支持全村，任务压的愁眉皱眼，后来没表这一功反批评“态度不好”，过去逃避工作的张金榜也提出“强迫他送信”，本来这些都不是兰玉的缺点，叫谁也打不通思想，可是他想：“群众提对了就是咱的明路，提不对为了消灭地主也接受，别打击了群众情绪”。
    经过民主提意见，兰玉消灭地主的情绪不见丝毫下降，天天一睁眼就有事，一直到半夜，没吃过一顿正时的热饭，没有干粮面就用牛料代替，会员没吃的借给他们，情愿自己节省，也别影响会员情绪，就这么一来，二百多斤粮食出了手，两个来月，地主消灭了，果实分清了。全村人们那一个不说兰玉能干，又公平又廉洁，性体又好。
    一坑水有深也有浅，干部中有落后也有模范，兰玉在圣佛堂是太积极了，但他对落后干部的认识却有糊涂观念，他哥哥当委员落后了也是一样的批，他只注意了这一面，但对耐心说服帮助落后进步没打通，他说：“天生都是个人，该干啥就干啥！”
    运动结束时，个别落后干部说：“大干部都在西头，西头地主斗的轻”，一部分新升为富中农的村干分果实很少，背后说：“杀人白落两手血，啄木鸟与夜猫子睡，有熬的眼，没吃的虫”，兰玉一听立时起了火，“都是咱全农会商量的，谁不知道一碗水端平，这会又大干部小干部、轻啦重啦，我也是新中农没分果实，为此，老婆成天埋怨。”兰玉只把牢骚念给了自己听。他不满意落后村干也不满意自己，也许人家资格老，一办就比咱办的强？于是决定“推给他们干干”。
    兰玉决心要推掉农会主任，“刚火、突气子、不满意落后、自己没资格”迷住了他的心；他一心想个法推给东头说风凉话的人。他没有依靠领导，也没有依靠干部，亲自到群众里作动员，选举时他和永贞多投了几个棒子粒，就达到他的目的了。兰玉从推掉主任，开会也不发言了，一心去种自己的地，和群众也渐渐疏远起来了。从此村里工作一天消沉一天。但兰玉终久是共产党拉把起来的优秀的翻透身的农民，热心为群众办事的领袖，他死也忘不了共产党，忘不了革命，忘不了群众，他看到村里工作一日不如一日，受到了严重的良心责备，他自己问自己：“翻透了身往家一抽，这算革啥命？”他又想：“上级知道咱推了还好点，要不知道，还说是咱负责干不好”。
    这时立功运动开展到圣佛堂，他说：“刚民主了又报功，过去是好也散伙，坏也散伙，落后的不干还是不干”。动员他报功时他说：“跑腿办点事有啥功，人家能说会道的有资格的才有功。”因此立功没有震动他，他认为即便有功，干部一走还不是白评？评那干啥！所以报功时大部分是耿思成帮着他报的，经过干部群众一评，他的功劳一点没有抹煞，荣列头等功臣，全村的人大功小功也都评了个一清二白，这样是刮起一阵清风，吹醒了兰玉，也吹醒了全村干部和群众，他两个月没有剃的长头发剃光了，脸上泛起了笑容，在街上见了人也打打闹闹，人们说：“兰玉又活泼了”。
    他看到耿全德评为二等功臣，这次自动报名出了担架，使他更兴奋了，他说：“能叫群众起来，办啥工作也好办了”。他要功上加功，又深刻检讨自己：“我犯了很大的错误，走错了道，头一个推掉了主任，没领导群众生产。第二个妨碍上级一切工作不能进行，这都是革命的损失。”同时他又检查出“刚火能刚出个啥，想把工作作好得耐心帮助落后的干部群众进步”，现在他又被选为联合会的副主任，他说：“立功把道弄明了，以后要做个样子叫大家跟着干”。
