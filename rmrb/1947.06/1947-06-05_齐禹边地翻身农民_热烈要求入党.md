　　Peasants in the Qi-Yu Border Region Who Have Overturned Their Lives
    Enthusiastically Request to Join the Party
    [Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 3rd] In the Qi-Yu (newly designated county comprising parts of Qihe and Yucheng) border area, a 4,000-peasant review of emancipation conference was held in the first ten days of last month. At the meeting, the masses unanimously agreed that Chiang Kai-shek was a bitter chinaberry tree, and the landlords were the roots of the bitter chinaberry tree. The masses must resolutely dig up this bitter chinaberry tree. In the villages, this means thoroughly implementing the re-examination. The bitter roots that have already been dug up (landlords who have been struggled against) must be placed in the sun to bake them, and they must never be placed in damp places to allow them to sprout bitter buds again. Those that have only been half-dug must be resolutely dug up completely, which means a thorough re-examination. On the other hand, the masses also clarified in their thinking that the world is created by the working people, and whoever labors is the master of society. They understood that the Communist Party's roots are planted in the working people, and wherever the Communist Party's roots are planted, the working people will be emancipated and become masters of their own destiny. Therefore, at the conference, the peasants enthusiastically requested to join the Communist Party. In villages such as Luzhuang, Qizhuang, and Donghong, 1,931 people requested to join the Party, including 749 women. Two days after the meeting, a vigorous re-examination struggle was launched in various villages. One household in Yangzhuang was found to have 120 silver dollars and over 200 catties of copper coins. One household in Cuizhuang was found to have 2,000 catties of wheat and four or five bundles.

　　齐禹边地翻身农民
    热烈要求入党
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】齐禹（新划县齐河，禹城各一部）边沿区于上月上旬召开四千农民检查翻身大会，会上群众一致认为蒋介石是苦莲子树，地主是苦莲树根，群众要坚决刨掉这苦莲子树，在村里就是要贯彻复查，已经刨掉的苦根（斗过的地主），要放到太阳下晒着他，千万别把他们放到潮地方再叫他生了苦芽。刨了半截的坚决要刨掉它，也就是复查彻底。另方面群众思想上也明确了世界是劳动人民创造的，谁劳动谁就是社会的主人，了解了共产党的根扎在劳动人民的身上，共产党这股根扎到那里，那里劳动人民就会翻身当家。因此大会上农民热烈要求参加共产党。芦庄、齐庄、东洪等村，要求参加党的有一千九百三十一人，内有妇女七百四十九人。会后两天各村即轰轰烈烈的掀起了复查斗争，杨庄一户就查出银元一百二十块，铜元二百多斤。崔庄一户就查出两千斤麦子，四五个包袱。
