Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 31st -- The masses in Qiuhu District, Zishi County, Central Jiangsu, have created a new method of mutual cooperation between the central and border areas for harvesting summer wheat during the war. Last month, when the enemy occupied Gaojia Garden, most of the young and middle-aged people in Shuangyan Township in the district participated in logistics, and there was no one to harvest the wheat. However, more than 50 people from Jianchi Township, who were only separated from Gaojia Garden by a river and had moved to the township to avoid the enemy, immediately organized themselves and harvested 200 mu of wheat for the masses in Shuangyan Township in one and a half days. The next day, when the enemy temporarily withdrew from the Gaojia Garden stronghold, more than 100 people from Shuangyan Township immediately rushed to Jianchi Township and harvested more than 500 mu of wheat fields in two days, ensuring that the new wheat in both townships was harvested on schedule. The two villages in the south of Baoxiang Township were close to the Jiang (Nian) Qu (Tang) Hai (An) highway, and the enemy harassed the villages every day. The masses in the two villages formed a "day and night big work group" of more than 100 people. During the day, they went to the central area to harvest together, and at night, they went to both sides of the highway to harvest for the masses in the border area. After harvesting, they sent it to the central area for threshing. In the four days and four nights from the 15th to the 20th, the "day and night big work group" harvested more than 300 mu of wheat fields.

　　苏中中心区边沿区
    灵活变工日夜抢收
    【新华社华中三十一日电】苏中紫石县仇湖区群众，在战争期中，创造中心区边沿区互相配合抢收夏麦的新方法。上月间，敌人进占高家花园时，该区双严乡大部青壮年均参加后勤，麦子无人收割，而与高家花园仅一河之隔的坚持乡五十余群众恰巧移至该乡避敌，当即自动组织起来，一天半中为双严乡群众割麦二百亩。第二天，敌人一度撤离高家花园据点，双严乡百余群众，立即赶至坚持乡两天中抢割五百余亩麦田，使两乡新麦均如期登场。该区宝祥乡南部两个村紧接姜（埝）曲（塘）海（安）公路，敌天天下乡骚扰，两村群众组成百余人的“日夜大伴工组”，白天一齐至中心区收割，入夜挺至公路两侧，为边沿区群众收割，割好后，又分头送至中心区去打，十五至二十日四天四夜中，“日夜大伴工组”即抢割三百多亩麦田。
