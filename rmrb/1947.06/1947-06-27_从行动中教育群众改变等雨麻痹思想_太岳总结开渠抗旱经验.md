　　Educating the Masses Through Action to Change the Paralysis of Waiting for Rain
    Taiyue Summarizes Experience in Canal Digging and Drought Resistance
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th dispatch] The drought resistance and disaster prevention movement has become a serious struggle for the entire region to conquer nature, and various places have encountered some difficulties in this movement, while also experiencing some experiences in breaking through these difficulties: The first difficulty is the farmers' mentality of relying on the heavens and waiting, such as when Li Jiazhuang in Qin Yuan mobilized to dig canals, some villagers said, "It's going to rain soon, no need to waste manpower." Some people in Houjiang Village in Jincheng once said, "If the heavens don't want people to eat, then there's nothing we can do." The masses in Jinfeng said, "It doesn't matter if the wheat is damaged by drought, autumn crops won't be delayed for a few more days." After mass discussions, the problem was generally solved in various places; taking Luoshui Village in Qinshui County as an example, the masses offered pigs to the "Dragon King," but it didn't rain, so the cadres used this concrete experience to persuade the masses. The masses finally said, "We can't rely on the heavens for food anymore." They immediately started digging canals, and from May 10th to 18th, they restored three old canals, irrigating 215 mu of land in four days. The cadres then used this fact to further break the masses' thinking of relying on the heavens, and continued to launch an irrigation campaign to save seedlings. Now, a total of 23 old canals have been restored, and 15 "weighing poles" (likely referring to water-lifting devices) have been installed, irrigating a total of 2,470 mu of land, and water carrying and replanting have also been carried out on the mountain land. Yangcheng Fourth District launched a "four搶 (qiang)" movement –搶 (qiang) planting,搶 (qiang) replanting,搶 (qiang) harvesting wheat, and搶 (qiang) weeding seedlings – under the understanding that "people can still starve under the ears of grain." Zhangxun Village also formulated a production and conservation plan for each household, with women and children collecting a total of 20,500 jin of wild vegetables. The entire Wangbi Village in Qinyuan organized to抢 (qiang) plant after the rain, and everyone recognized the truth that "it is better for the heavens to fail than for people to fail." The second difficulty is changing the farmers' conservative old experiences, such as when the Wu'an Primary School in Shiming Second District dug a canal on the north bank of the Houcun River, some people said, "It won't work, we've tried it before! The water won't go up." But they persisted and finally succeeded. The masses then believed it. The third difficulty is that cadres and the masses look down on irrigating one seedling as one seedling, and saving one seedling is one seedling. Some people in Wangxi Village and Gu Village in Shimin still have the idea of relying on government relief, which requires cadres to take the lead in leading the masses to work. For example, under the slogan of "digging canals to prevent drought and making contributions to the people," the cadres in Zhongyu Village in Qinyuan adopted a method of breaking through a point, starting small and growing big, starting from the masses' concrete experience, opening one canal after another. The more the masses did, the more energetic they became. On June 1st, only three people were mobilized to irrigate four mu of land, and by the 4th, a large canal capable of irrigating more than 200 mu of land had been built. Li Shouxi, director of the Yangcheng Fifth District Farmers' Association, Liu Shiyi, director of public security, and village head Zhang Zhichang, personally dug a well, irrigating 10 mu of land, and promoted the digging of four wells in the village, irrigating 70 mu of land. In Li Jiazhuang, Qinyuan, under the leadership of Comrade Guo Zhishan of the District Party Committee and village cadres Wu Lajin and others, on June 6th, they repaired a canal of 362 zhang, irrigating more than 200 mu of land.

　　从行动中教育群众改变等雨麻痹思想
    太岳总结开渠抗旱经验
    【本报太岳廿五日电】抗旱防灾运动已成为全区以人胜天的严重斗争，各地在此运动中遇到一些难关，同时亦体验出一些突破难关的经验：头一道难关是农民的靠天等待思想，如沁源李家庄动员开渠时，村民有人说：“天快要下，不必浪费民力”。晋城侯匠村曾有人说：“天不叫人吃，那就没有办法”。金峰群众说：“麦子旱坏就不说了，秋庄稼再过几日也不误”。各地经过群众讨论，一般得到解决；以沁水县落水村为例，群众献了猪“龙王爷”不下雨，干部就用这种具体经验说服群众。群众最后才说：“不能靠天吃饭了”。当即动手开渠，从五月十日至十八日恢复旧渠三道，四天中浇地二百一十五亩。干部再用这个事实进一步打破了群众靠天的思想，继续展开浇地救苗运动，现在共已恢复旧的二十三道，安秤杆十五个，共浇地二千四百七十亩，山上地也都进行担水补种。阳城四区在“谷穗底下还饿死人”的认识下展开了四抢运动——抢种，抢补，抢割麦，抢锄苗。章训村并按户订出生产节约计划，女人、小孩共采野菜两万零五百斤。沁源王壁村全村组织起来进行雨后抢种，大家都认识：“宁让天误不让人误”的真理。第二道难关是改变农民的保守旧经验，如士敏二区武安小学在侯村河口北岸上开渠，有些群众说：“不成，过去早试过啦！水上不去。”他们却坚持下去，终于开成了。群众才相信了。第三道难关是干部群众看不起浇一苗算一苗，救一苗是一苗。士敏王溪村、固村还有人存在着依靠政府救济思想，这就必须干部带头领起群众去干。如沁源中峪村干部在“开渠防旱，为民立功”的口号下，采取突破一点，由小而大的办法，从群众具体经验出发，开了一条又一条，群众越干越有劲，六月一日还只动员了三个群众，引水浇地四亩，到四日就修成浇地二百余的大渠一条。阳城五区农会主任李守喜、公安主任刘士已，村长张志昌等人亲自动手打井一眼，浇地十亩，推动村中打了四眼井，浇地七十亩。沁源李家庄则在区分委郭志山同志及村干部武拉金等带头下，于六月六日修渠三百六十二丈浇地二百余亩。
