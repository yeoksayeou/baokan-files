The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain
    Intensifies the Rush to Harvest Wheat
    [Our Newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 8th Dispatch] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain is intensifying the rush to harvest wheat. According to our front-line reporter who returned to the office on the 3rd of this month: on the way back from the Henan front to Hebei-Shandong-Henan, across hundreds of miles of the vast plain, the wheat has turned golden, and farmers are happily harvesting in the fields. After the land reform, the liberated peasants in various places have obtained much land. Some peasants harvested the fertile wheat less than a month after obtaining the land, and their hearts were filled with joy. Puyang, Hua County, Nanle, Qingfeng, Pu County and other counties may have 80 to 90 percent of a normal wheat harvest this year. Although there is a shortage of rain in the Nanfeng and Fan County areas, according to experienced farmers, the wheat has not suffered from other diseases this year, and the wheat harvest is better than last year, about 50 to 60 percent of a normal harvest. In recent days, the democratic government has called on all party, government, military, civilian, and cadre personnel in the entire region to fully help the masses harvest wheat. From the 1st of this month, various agencies, troops, and schools have organized wheat harvesting teams to help military dependents stationed in villages and poor farmers without labor to harvest wheat. Our office alone helped the masses harvest 320 mu of wheat in four days. The villages also organized large-scale labor exchanges for the whole village to collectively harvest wheat. The wheat harvest in the entire region is expected to be completed in a few days.

　　冀鲁豫平原
    加紧突击麦收
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】翼鲁豫平原加紧突击麦收，本月三日，据本社前线记者返社时谈称：从豫北前线东返冀鲁豫途中，广阔数百里的平原上，小麦已成一片金黄，遍野老农含笑收割。各地翻身农民于土地改革后，获得许多土地，有的农民在获得土地后未及一月即收获肥美小麦，内心充满欢笑。濮阳、滑县、南乐、清丰、濮县等县今年小麦可能有八、九成年景。南峰、范县一带虽雨水较缺，但据有经验之老农民说，今年小麦未受其他病害，麦收亦较去年为优，约有五、六成年景。日来民主政府号召全区党、政、军、民、干杂人员全力帮助群众麦收，从本月一日起，各机关、部队、学校即纷纷组织麦收队，分别为驻村军属及无劳力之贫苦农民，进行麦收。仅本社四天内帮助群众割麦三百二十亩，各村亦同时组织全村大变工，集体割麦，全区麦收数天内可望结束。
