　　Women's Participation Plays a Big Role
　　Jincheng's Weeding Nears Completion
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 23rd] With all and semi-able-bodied laborers in Jincheng going to the fields, the county's weeding is nearing completion in ten days. In particular, women have played a leading role. When Dongdi Village in the Eighth District launched a crash weeding campaign, women weeded one-third of the village's autumn crops. When Dongbei Village in the Seventh District started weeding, the women said: This year, our women will guarantee the first and second weedings. The women's association chairperson went to the fields despite being ill, weeding 87.5 mu in six days, accounting for eight-tenths of the village's autumn fields. During weeding in the Fourth District, the cooperative's oil mill was shut down, and everyone went to the fields together, leaving one person to watch the door. Villages did not stop sideline production during weeding. Cadres in Beizhai Village in the Eighth District provided flexible leadership. Male laborers cut mulberry leaves to feed silkworms before dawn and at noon, and carried water from the river after dinner. Children and elderly women fed silkworms at home, freeing up people to weed, ensuring that silkworm rearing and weeding were not delayed. In Yanchang Village in the Fourth District, women watching children took their strollers to the fields. The whole village weeded 86 mu in four days. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in Heishiling went to the fields completely, and the village's seedlings were completely weeded in seven days. Dongxianzi Village weeded the millet and cotton seedlings in five days. The Hexi and Xiahe groups weeded 81 mu in seven days. The school cooperated with weeding and gave preferential treatment to military dependents. The Fourth Gao Weeding Brigade helped military dependents weed 342 mu, and the First Gao helped military dependents weed 81 mu.
