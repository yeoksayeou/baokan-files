　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The Taiyue-Lvliang People's Liberation Army fought side by side, and on the same day as the recovery of Puxian County (31st), liberated Fencheng, an important stronghold on the periphery of Linfen on the west side of the Tongpu Railway.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 4th. Various restoration works in the liberated Xiangning County are being actively carried out. On the 24th, just as the city attack battle had ended and the Nanshan battle was still fiercely unfolding, Wang Ruisheng, the county magistrate of the Xiangning Democratic Government, braved the artillery fire to lead government personnel into the city to work and comfort the residents from house to house. In recent days, social order has been established, and the financial situation has stabilized, with the exchange rate between the Chiang currency and the Ji currency at eight to one. The remaining hundred-odd shops in the city have resumed business one after another. The shopkeepers of each shop gathered on the 27th to discuss the issue of revitalizing the market, and have democratically formed a chamber of commerce. Farmers from the four villages, who had been unable to enter the city for many years, freely formed teams and flocked to the streets for the first time, praising the wise measures of the democratic government in abolishing Yan Xishan's "soldier-farmer unity" and returning the land to its original owners, realizing the principle of "land to the tiller," and so on. In order to relieve poverty, the democratic government first distributed 150 large shi (unit of dry measure) of relief grain in the city on the 30th, and distributed the captured coal.

　　我军解放汾城
    【新华社陕北三日电】太岳吕梁人民解放军并肩作战，与收复蒲县同日（三十一日），解放同蒲西侧临汾外围之重要据点汾城。
    【新华社晋绥四日电】解放后之乡宁县各项恢复工作正积极进行。二十四日攻城战斗刚结束，南山战斗仍在激烈展开时，乡宁民主政府县长王瑞生冒炮火率领政府人员入城办公，挨户安抚居民。近日社会秩序已确立，金融稳定，蒋币与冀币为八比一。城内残存之百余家商号，已纷纷复业，各商号掌柜于二十七日集合讨论繁荣市面问题，并已民主组成商会。多年未能进城之四乡农民首次自由结队涌现街头，对民主政府废除阎锡山“兵农合一”与地归原主，实现耕者有其田等贤明措施，备加赞扬。民主政府为救济贫困，于三十日首先于城关散发一百五十大石救济粮，并散发缴获之煤炭。
