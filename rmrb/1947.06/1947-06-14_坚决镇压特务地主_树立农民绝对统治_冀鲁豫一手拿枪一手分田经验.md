　　The main experience of the Jilu Yu Region in carrying out land reform during the guerrilla war is: resolutely suppress the despotic gentry, special agent landlords, strictly control general landlords, and establish the absolute rule of the peasants. In the past, the reactionary forces of the landlords were exaggerated onesidedly, believing that offending the landlords would make me an enemy everywhere, and the guerrilla warfare could not be sustained. It was not understood that taking up guns and distributing land was the fundamental content of guerrilla warfare. Failing to resolutely rely on the peasants, but accommodating the landlords in everything, and not daring to engage in sharp struggles, resulted in the landlords becoming rampant and the peasants demoralized. After implementing resolute armed struggle, the landlords changed their faces and bowed their heads to the people. In the past, the erroneous "anti-Chiang and protect-home united front" was discussed with the landlords, and the peasants' struggle against the landlords was not actively supported, resulting in the peasants becoming demoralized and the landlords rampant. After February, a firm policy began to be implemented: resolutely suppress the treacherous and tyrannical landlords who relied on the enemy's power to harm the masses and were bitterly hated by the masses, and allow the masses to carry out revolutionary revenge against them. Implement checks and detention on landlords who openly and secretly threatened peasants; implement organized and comprehensive control over general landlords. The peasants were very happy, and the landlords bowed their heads. In some places, due to the increase in enemy forces and the deterioration of the landlords' attitudes, sharp struggles were carried out in a tit-for-tat manner. Timely strike at the evil landlords to subdue them. At the same time, seize the opportunity to implement land reform, mobilize the masses, and make the mass control of landlords more effective. Some cadres once believed that "the masses dare not ask for land and food," but in fact, the masses were everywhere inquiring about "when to divide" and calling for "divide it quickly!" At this time, the more resolute the leadership, the more courageous the masses will be. Juancheng concentrated its armed forces to deal with the enemy, and dispersed them to divide land and food. Some places directly told the landlords: "If the masses don't divide the land, you are responsible," frightening the landlords to beg the masses to divide the land, making the masses more courageous and more confident in the leadership, and the land reform proceeded more rapidly, and the guerrilla war became stronger and more effective due to the rapid establishment and development of the militia.

　　坚决镇压特务地主
    树立农民绝对统治
    冀鲁豫一手拿枪一手分田经验
    冀鲁豫区在游击战争中实行土地改革的主要经验是：坚决镇压恶霸豪绅特务地主，严密控制一般地主，树立农民的绝对统治。过去曾片面夸大地主的反动力量，以为得罪了地主，即会使我到处受敌，游击战无法坚持，不了解一手拿枪一手分田是游击战争的根本内容，未能坚决依靠农民，却事事迁就地主，不敢尖锐斗争，结果致地主猖狂，农民消沉。以后实行坚决的武装斗争，地主即改换面孔，向人民低头；过去曾错误的与地主讲“反蒋保家统一战线”，未能积极支持农民对地主斗争，结果，又是农民消沉，地主猖狂。二月以后，开始实行坚定的政策：对依仗敌势残害群众，为群众切齿痛恨的奸霸地主坚决镇压，允许群众对其实行革命报复。对公开与秘密威胁农民的地主，实行检举扣押；对一般地主实行有组织的全面控制。农民大快，地主俯首。有些地方因敌人兵力增大，地主态度恶化，即进行针锋相对的尖锐斗争。对作恶地主及时打击，使其降服。同时，抓紧时机贯彻土地改革，发动群众，使群众性的控制地主更加有力。有些干部曾经认为“群众不敢要田要粮”，实际上群众到处在打听着“啥时分”，呼吁着“快分吧”！这时领导上越坚决，群众就越有勇气。鄄城把武装集中起来对付敌人，分散开来分田分粮。有的地方直接告诉地主：“群众不分田，你们负责任”，吓得地主哀求群众分田，使群众更加气壮，更加相信领导，土地改革就进行得更迅速，游击战争也因民兵的迅速建立与发展而更加坚强有力。
