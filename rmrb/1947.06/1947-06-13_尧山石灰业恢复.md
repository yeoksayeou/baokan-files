　　Yao Mountain Limestone Industry Resumes
    [Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, dated the 12th] The renowned Yao Mountain limestone of Southern Hebei can supply the needs of dozens of counties. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders. In order to support the development of the limestone industry, the County Bank specially sent Chai Yujie to gather kiln owners from various villages for a meeting. He explained the bank's determination to provide loans to develop the limestone industry, elected business representatives from each village, and then distributed loans totaling more than 2 million yuan. After Mao Shan and Niuluo Town received loans of 50,000 yuan, they immediately started firing limestone. One kiln needs to burn 700 catties of coal, worth 23,000 yuan, and can produce 2,800 catties of limestone, which can be sold for 41,000 yuan at 15 yuan per catty.

　　尧山石灰业恢复
    【本报冀南十二日电】驰名冀南之尧山石灰可供数十县之用，抗战期间被日寇摧残殆尽。县银行为扶植石灰业的发展，特派柴于杰赴各村召集窑户开会，讲明决心贷款发展石灰业，选举了各村业务员，随即发放贷款二百余万元，并鼓励群众集股经营。毛山、牛洛镇得贷款五万元后，即进行烧石灰，一个窑需烧七百斤煤，价值两万三千元，可烧出石灰二千八百斤，每斤十五元，可卖四万一千元。
