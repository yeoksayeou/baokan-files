Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd (Delayed Dispatch) On May 3rd, Huangxia Township, Yazhou District, Taixian County, in the "mopping-up" zone south of the Hai-Tai Line, erupted in a mass anti-Chiang demonstration of six thousand people. Chiang regime personnel fled upon hearing the news, and the Chiang army did not dare to move out. This township is only a line away from the Chiang-occupied area. In the past seven months, it has suffered more than a hundred raids by the Chiang army. Cooking stoves were destroyed, and there was no food left in any household. However, the people resolutely refused to yield. No one surrendered, and no household paid contributions. The Chiang army then ordered that "If work in Huangxia Township cannot be advanced, one person from each family should be killed to show a 'warning'." The masses were extremely angry upon hearing this and organized themselves to carry out self-defense. At six o'clock in the morning on the 2nd, they transferred all children under ten years old and the elderly who could not walk to a safe area. The remaining six thousand able-bodied men and women formed the Four Protection Brigades to protect their lives, protect the young men, protect the fields, and protect the summer harvest. In addition, a crack squad of militiamen was formed as a picket team. On the morning of the 3rd, the brigades lined up in several columns, each detachment with a large red flag, each squad with a large gong, and each person holding a rake and hoe, heading straight for the Chiang-occupied area south of Hai'an. Along the way, tens of thousands of arms waved, and tens of thousands of throats roared. The Chiang army and the Chiang-appointed township chiefs and security chiefs were terrified at this fierce momentum and fled in panic. The masses chased after them, shouting, "Catch the head of civil affairs alive!" (the worst element locally, the local Chiang leader), the roar shaking for miles. More than twenty Chiang-appointed township chiefs and security chiefs who had not escaped were immediately captured and one was publicly tried and executed on the spot. When they arrived near Zushi Temple, the two worst "Homecoming Corps" members had already fled, so the masses demolished their houses. Those who had been robbed of an egg took two tiles, those who had been robbed of a chicken took a rafter, and those who had been robbed of a pig carried a piece of wood. In an instant, more than a dozen large tiled houses were reduced to nothing. The parade did not return home in good order until the afternoon.

　　苏中黄夏乡不堪蒋军蹂躏
    六千群众赴蒋区示威
    【新华社华中二日电】（迟到）五月三日，海泰线以南“清剿”区内之泰县雅周区黄夏乡爆发六千群众反蒋示威大游行。蒋政权人员闻风逃遁，蒋军亦未敢出动。该乡与蒋占区仅一线之隔，七个月来遭受蒋军百余次洗劫，锅灶被毁，户无存粮。但人民坚决不屈，无一人自首，无一户缴捐。蒋军乃下令“黄夏乡工作不能推进，应一家杀一个，以示‘警戒’。群众闻讯愤极，乃组织起来，进行自卫。二日清晨六时，悉将十岁以下儿童及不能行走的老人向安全地带转移，留下的六千青壮男女，成立保命、保丁、保田、保夏收之四保大队，另由民兵组成精干的纠察队。三日晨，保田大队列成数路纵队，每分队一面大红旗，每班一面大锣，每人手拿钉耙、锄头，浩浩荡荡直奔海（安）南蒋占区。沿途千万只臂膊挥舞，千万个喉咙怒吼。蒋军、蒋记乡保长见此猛势，惊骇万状，纷纷夺路窜逃。群众队伍在后追赶，高呼：“活捉民事头子”（当地最坏分子，土蒋头子），吼声振撼数里。当即捕获未及逃脱之蒋记乡保长二十余人，就地公审枪决一名。行至祖师庙附近时，当地最坏之两个“还乡团”员已逃窜，群众乃将其房屋拆除。被抢过一只鸡蛋的拿两片瓦，一只鸡的拿一条椽子，一只猪的扛一根木头，顷刻间十数间大瓦房化为乌有。游行至下午始整队顺利回家。
