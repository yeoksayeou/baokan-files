　　Rapid Progress in Soviet Industry and Mining
    New Mineral Deposits Continuously Discovered, Undersea Exploration Conducted in the Caspian Sea
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th] Comprehensive Report: The second year of the Soviet Union's post-war Five-Year Plan for industrial and mining metallurgy is progressing rapidly under the vigorous promotion of the working people.
    Industry: Factories in the Vyborg district, one of Leningrad's largest industrial areas, completed their five-month plan sixteen days ahead of schedule. More than seventy factories in Moscow completed their plans ten days ahead of schedule. Several departments of Baku's new ball bearing factories (one of the largest projects in the post-war Five-Year Plan) have already started production. Thousands of machines manufactured in Leningrad are being shipped to all parts of the country. The Stalin Factory will manufacture 250,200 kilowatt turbines for the Dnieper River and other power stations this year. The output of electrical equipment throughout the Soviet Union has increased several times compared to last year and will exceed the pre-war level by the end of the year. The quality of consumer goods such as clothing and shoes, and light industry has also greatly improved, with output in the first four months exceeding the same period last year by 50 percent. More than 2,600 food factories have now been restored.
    Mining and Metallurgy: The two main coal industry conglomerates in the Donets Basin increased coal production by 75,000 tons compared to the original plan. The technical equipment of coal mines throughout the Soviet Union has been rapidly modernized, and the number of coal mines equipped with machinery and transportation locomotives has doubled. The number of automatic coal mining plows has tripled, and the Soviet Union's largest six-ton mine hoists have been put into operation in a certain coal mine. A large number of geologists from the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Academies of Sciences of various republics have concentrated most of their efforts to assist the Soviet Ministry of Geology and Ferrous Metallurgy in expanding the exploration of various mineral deposits and have achieved significant results. Vast lignite deposits have been discovered in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, and coal mines have also been discovered by the Arctic exploration team on the Taimyr Peninsula. Vast iron ore basins have been discovered in the Kazakh Republic, the first mine pit has been started, and a new industrial center is rising on the grasslands. The Ural Academy of Sciences has completed the exploration of the central and southern Urals and is now exploring this part of the Urals, having discovered large amounts of iron ore and copper ore. In 1950, the iron production of the Urals will be double that of 1940. In order to build steel factories in the northwestern Soviet Union, large-scale exploration plans are being carried out in Karelia, the Finnish Republic, and other places. The exploration of manganese ore and other rare metal deposits is being widely carried out throughout the Soviet Union. In the Caspian Sea near Baku, thousands of tons of explosives are being used for the world's first undersea explosions to explore for new oil fields. In a certain area of Transcaucasia, special machines are being used to drill the deepest oil wells, reaching a depth of 5,000 meters. The largest paraffin wax deposit in the Soviet Union has been discovered in Central Asia, and a large factory will be established by the end of the year to produce paraffin wax. The Arctic exploration team has also discovered precious ruby-colored mica deposits outside the Arctic Circle, which will soon be mined.

　　苏联工矿业飞速进展
    新的矿藏不断发现里海进行海底勘探
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合报导：苏联战后五年计划中工业矿冶的第二年计划，在劳动人民的努力推动下，正飞速进展中。
    工业方面：列宁格勒最大工业区之一的维堡区的工厂较原定日期提前十六天完成五个月的计划。莫斯科有七十多个工厂提前十天完成了计划。巴库的几个新球轴承工厂（战后五年计划中最大计划之一）的数部门已经开工。列城制造的几千种机器正运往全国各地。斯大林工厂今年将为第聂泊河及其他的动力站制造二十五万零二千千瓦的涡轮。全苏电工器材的产量已比去年增加数倍，年底将超过战前水平。衣服鞋袜等消费品，轻工业的质量也大大提高，前四个月内的产量即较去年同时期内超过百分之五十。现已恢复了二千六百余家食品工厂。
    矿冶方面：顿内茨盆地两个主要煤业组合较原计划增产煤七万五千吨。全苏各处煤矿的技术装备很快的现代化了，装有机械和运输机车的煤矿数已增加两倍。自动掘煤锄的数目已增加三倍，苏联最大载重六吨矿井起重机已在某煤矿动用。苏联科学院和各共和国科学院的大批地质学家，集中大部分力量协助苏联地质与钢铁业部扩大勘测各种矿苗，已获重大成就。第聂泊河中流发现广大的褐煤矿源，北极探险队在台麦尔半岛也发现了煤矿。哈萨克共和国发现广大的铁矿盆地，第一个矿坑已动工兴修，一个新的工业中心正在草原上崛起。乌拉尔科学院已完成了乌拉尔中南部的勘查，现正勘查此乌拉尔，已发现大量的铁矿铜矿，一九五○年乌拉尔铁的产量将为一九四○年的两倍。为了建设苏联西北部的钢铁工厂，卡累利阿、芬兰共和国等地正进行宏大的勘测计划。全苏各地正普遍的勘测锰矿及其他稀有金属的矿苗。巴库附近里海海底正以数千吨炸药从事全世界破天荒第一次海底爆炸，以探寻新的油矿。外高加索某地正以特种机器开凿深达五千公尺的最深的油井，中亚细亚已发现了全苏最大的石腊矿床，年底即将建立大工厂生产石腊。北极探险队又在北极圈外发现珍贵的红玉色的云母矿，即将开采。
