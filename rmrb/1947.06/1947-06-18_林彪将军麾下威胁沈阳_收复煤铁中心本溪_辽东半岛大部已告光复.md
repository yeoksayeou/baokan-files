Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 15th: General Lin Biao's ever-victorious troops recaptured Benxi City, an important coal and iron center in Northeast China producing 200,000 tons of pig iron annually, and the Gongyuan Station south of it on the 13th, wiping out over 100 enemies. The remaining enemies fled in panic. This is the 36th city recovered during the Northeast Summer Offensive. To date, the Democratic Allied Forces have controlled over 300 li (Chinese miles) along the An(dong)-Shen(yang) line, directly threatening Shenyang, and are now only 130 li from the city.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: After capturing Gaiping, Xiuyan, and Pulandian earlier this month, the Liaonan Democratic Allied Army successively recovered the county towns of Zhuanghe and Fuxian, as well as important towns such as Dagushan (seaside between Andong and Zhuanghe), Pikou (i.e., Piziwo on the coast of the Yellow Sea southwest of Fuxian), and Wafangdian. Currently, except for two battalions of the 25th Division of the Chiang army still rampaging in the Xiongyuecheng area, there are no enemy traces in the vast area south of Dashiqiao, including the entire Liaodong Peninsula; the Democratic Allied Forces have complete control of 300 li of the southern section of the China Changchun Railway between Gaiping and Pulandian, and over 800 li of coastline from Andong to Pikou and the territories of Gaiping and Fuxian counties.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 15th: After liberating the entire Andong Province, the Liaonan People's Liberation Army continued to recover Xiongyuecheng, an important station on the southern section of the China Changchun Railway (located between Gaiping and Fuxian). Thus far, our army has controlled the entire railway line south of Gaiping, only 70 li north of Yingkou, a key port on the Liaodong Peninsula. The remaining two battalions of the 73rd Regiment of the newly reorganized 25th Division of the 52nd Army of the Chiang army in the Liaonan area have had their retreat cut off, and they are running around aimlessly. The Democratic Allied Forces are currently pursuing and annihilating them.

Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 16th: In the battle to recover Gaiping on the 10th, the Liaonan Democratic Allied Forces annihilated a total of over 1,100 enemies, including two companies of the Chiang army's reorganized 25th Division and over 600 puppet security troops; additionally, over 100 members of the Zhuanghe Security Team were killed or wounded, and over 400 were captured alive. The captured materials include 6 light machine guns, 1 60mm mortar, 5 submachine guns, over 300 rifles and short guns, 3 automobiles, over 100 carts, and a portion of other ammunition and supplies.
