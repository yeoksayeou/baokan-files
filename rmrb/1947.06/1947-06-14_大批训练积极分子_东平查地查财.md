　　Mass Training of Activists
    Dongping Investigates Land and Property
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu, 11th dispatch] In the newly recovered areas of Dongping County, our district has transitioned from revenge to investigating land and property. The Third District has achieved great success. In mid-May, the district convened a training class for over a thousand activists, followed by a mass rally of fifteen thousand peasants united to turn over a new leaf. A landlord who had fallen to the ground was shot on the spot. By May 17th, in the entire district, seventy large villages with over forty thousand peasants (representing four-fifths of the district's households) had organized investigation teams to investigate the hidden wealth of the landlords. After uncovering a large amount of property, the idea that cadres couldn't achieve anything was dispelled, and the enthusiasm of the masses soared to unprecedented levels. Men and women alike, day and night, worked together to transport and distribute the fruits of their labor. An old man in Xinzhuang, after receiving a leather coat, put it on in the scorching field and ran around the field three times, sweating profusely, saying, "Now I can finally enjoy the luxury of a leather coat." Some peasants even carried out "face-saving returns," such as the tenant farmers in Shangzhuang. After the distribution of goods, a tenant farmer in his fifties said, "I've farmed for landlord Yin Zuochi for half my life. His second daughter has never addressed me respectfully, she must come and call me 'Grandpa' three times." Then, they brought Yin Zuochi's second daughter and made her call him "Grandpa" three times on the spot. During the movement, women also stepped out of their homes and organized women's model teams to guard and control the local bullies, gangsters, and landlords, thus suppressing the prestige and arrogance of the landlords. Currently, the property investigation in the Third District is developing further and more deeply.

　　大批训练积极分子
    东平查地查财
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】我东平县新收复区，已由复仇进入查地查财。三区已获得很大成绩。五月中，区召开了千余积极分子的训练班，接着又举行了万五千人的农民同心翻身大会，当场枪毙一个倒地的地主，至五月十七日全区已有七十个大村四万多农民（按户占全区五分之四）组织清查大队，清查地主隐蔽的浮财。在查出大批资财后，打破了干部没搞头的思想，群众情绪空前的高涨，男女一齐不分昼夜的搬运和分配果实。辛庄一个老大爷分得一件皮袄后，就在炎热的场里穿上，围着场跑了三遍，跑得满头大汗说：“可过过皮袄瘾”。有的农民还进行了“面子回家”的行动，如尚庄的佃户，于分完东西后，一个五十多岁的佃户说：“我跟地主尹祚池种了半辈子地，他家二妮子没喊过我的大号，非叫她来喊三声大爷不成”。接着就把地主尹祚池的二妮喊来，当场喊了三声大爷。运动中妇女也走出大门，组织了妇女模范班，对恶霸坏蛋地主加以看守管押，因此地主的威风气焰被镇压下去。现在三区的查财，正进一步深入发展中。
