Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 18th: Zhangyuan after being invaded and occupied by the bandit Fu is filled with darkness and terror. Chiang and Fu's secret agents run amok, and many citizens are arrested without cause. In the concentration camps established by the bandit Fu, there are often around 2,000 innocent citizens imprisoned. Currently, the system of joint guarantee and conscription has been implemented in Zhangyuan city. All young adults aged 18 to 45 must register and can be conscripted into the army at any time. Police and secret agents check household registrations day and night, monitoring people's actions. Citizens must report in advance when moving, and hotel guests are only allowed to stay for two days. When registering households, only additions are allowed, and no cancellations are permitted, in order to prevent "evasion of military service." During household inspections, police and secret agents arbitrarily extort money and goods. As soon as they see something they want, they claim it belongs to the Eighth Route Army and take it away. The workers on the Ping-Sui Railway did not receive any wages for the first two months after the Fu bandit arrived. Su Jiren, the head of the Fu-controlled pseudo-Ping-Sui Railway Bureau, told the employees: "You have worked for the Japanese and the Eighth Route Army, and you are all traitors who should be punished. Not giving you money is a lenient punishment, allowing you to atone for your sins!" Last December, the Chiang and Fu authorities decided to implement "screening" for workers. Before the "screening" is completed, they must continue to work under the name of "standby," and during the "standby" period, they are paid "standby fees" according to three grades. However, inflation in Zhangyuan is rampant. Housing, drinking water, and lighting all require money, and the workers' lives are very difficult. They have to sell the things acquired during the Eighth Route Army's liberation of Zhangjiakou for one year to barely make ends meet. Under the brutal rule of the bandit Fu, the citizens are full of indignation and two sayings are circulating: "One day the Eighth Route Army will come." "The green crops are growing tall, it will be soon!"
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, June 19th: According to people from Gui Sui, Chiang's army's disastrous defeats on various battlefields have shocked Gui Sui. The spokesman of the Chiang-controlled Sui province believes that "the defeats in southern Shanxi and on the Zhengtai line will threaten the existence of Gui Sui." Military and government officials are pessimistic about the current situation. For example, the commander of the Cavalry Security Division, E You-san, spends his days indulging in wine and women, seeking numbness. The number of Fu army soldiers deserting is increasing, and deserters can be seen at any time on the mountain trails from Chahar Province to western Suiyuan.

　　张垣近况
    【新华社陕北十八日电】傅贼侵占后的张垣，充满了黑暗和恐怖。蒋傅特务任意横行，不少市民都被无故逮捕。在傅贼建立的集中营中，经常囚禁着无辜市民两千人上下。现张垣市内已实行连保连坐及征兵制度，凡十八岁至四十五岁的青壮年均须登记，随时征调入伍，警察特务不分昼夜的抽查户口，监视人民行动。市民迁移时必须事先呈报，旅店住客只准住宿两天。报户口时只许增加，不许注销，以防“逃避兵役”。在检查户口时，警察特务任意勒索，只要看见他们想要的东西，就说是八路军的，拿上就走。平绥路工人，傅顽到后，最初两月一文未发。傅记伪平绥路局局长苏纪忍给员工们讲话说：“你们给日本人、八路军做过事，都是汉奸，应该惩罚才对。不给你们钱是宽大你们，叫你们赎罪！”去年十二月，蒋傅当局又决定对工人实行“甄审”，在“甄审”未完毕以前仍须做工，名字叫做“待命”，“待命”期间按三等发给“待命费”。但张市物价涨风甚炽。住房、吃水、点灯样样需要花钱，工人们的生活非常窘迫，只好将八路军解放张家口一年中置下的东西变卖出来勉强糊口。在傅贼残暴统治之下，市民愤慨万分，流传着两句话：“总有一天八路军会来。”“青纱帐起来就快了！”
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】据归绥来人谈：蒋军在各战场的惨败震惊归绥。蒋记绥省发言人认为：“晋南及正太线之败局，将威胁归绥的存在。”军政官员对时局咸表悲观。如骑兵保安师师长鄂友三等即度在酒色中日，寻求麻醉。傅军士兵逃亡愈增，由察省通往绥西之山间小道上，逃兵随时可见。
