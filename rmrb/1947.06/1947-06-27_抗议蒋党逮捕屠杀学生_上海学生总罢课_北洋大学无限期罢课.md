　　Protesting Chiang Kai-shek's Arrest and Slaughter of Students
    Shanghai Students Stage General Strike
    Peiyang University Indefinitely Strikes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] According to Tianjin's Ta Kung Pao and Yishih Pao: Students from more than fifty universities and middle schools in Shanghai held a one-day general strike on the 10th to protest Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities of arresting and slaughtering students. Simultaneously, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other places also carried out similar strike and petition protests. All students at Peiyang University in Tianjin have held an indefinite strike since the 10th to protest the "disappearance" of Wang Zeliang, a student at the university. The student was kidnapped by Chiang's secret agents on June 2nd and has not been found since. According to student representatives, the strike will continue until Wang Zeliang is released. Wuhan University has not resumed classes since the June 1st tragedy. On the 10th, five student representatives from the university flew to Nanjing to protest and petition the Chiang government. In addition, Chaoyang College in Beiping, to protest the Chiang government's Ministry of Education's cancellation of the free tuition policy for students in the judicial group (a group attached to the law department), initiated a signature strike movement on the 10th, with over two hundred and twenty people signing within one day. On the 11th, they also decided to send representatives to Nanjing to petition.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th] TASS reported on the 19th: Moscow Labor Newspaper observer Alexanderov commented on the Chinese situation, stating: The Kuomintang authorities are using terror tactics in various cities to suppress the democratic movement, but despite official suppression, the student movement continues to rise. He further stated: The patriotic movement of Chinese students plays an important role in the resolute action of the broad masses of people in the Kuomintang areas to strive for peace and democracy. The Chinese student movement is often a sign of the rising dissatisfaction and anger of the masses and a harbinger of political revolution. Since the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference last year and launched another civil war, and the United States' policy towards China has been fully exposed, the student movement has begun to rise. Chinese students are determined to fight to the end to establish permanent peace and ensure genuine democratic reforms in the country.

    【新华社陕北廿四日电】据天津大公报、益世报消息：上海五十余大中学校学生于十日举行总罢课一天，以抗议蒋介石逮捕、屠杀学生之暴行。同时天津、武汉等地亦进行同样罢课及请愿之抗议运动。天津北洋大学全体学生自十日起举行无限期罢课，抗议该校学生王则梁“失踪”事件。该生六二被蒋特绑架后，迄无下落。据学生代表称：罢课将继续下去，直至王则梁被释放。武汉大学自六月一日惨案后，迄未复课。十日该校学生代表五人，已搭机赴京向蒋政府作抗议请愿。此外，北平朝阳学院为抗议蒋政府教育部取消司法组（法律系中附设之一个组）学生免费规定，于十日发起签名罢考运动，一日内签名者已达二百二十余人，十一日并决议派代表赴南京请愿。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社十九日讯：莫斯科劳动报观察家亚力山大罗夫评论中国时局称：国民党当局正在各城市采用恐怖手段镇压民主运动，但不顾官方的镇压，目前学生运动的浪潮继续高涨。继力称：中国学生的爱国运动，在国民党区域广大人民争取和平与民主的坚决行动的斗争中起着重要的作用。中国学生运动往往是人民大众正在高涨的不满与愤怒的标志和政治革命的先声。自去年国民党反动分子撕毁政协决议再次发动内战，而美国对华政策又暴露得完全清楚之后，学生运动即开始高涨，中国学生决心斗争到底，建立国内的永久和平，确保真正的民主改革。
