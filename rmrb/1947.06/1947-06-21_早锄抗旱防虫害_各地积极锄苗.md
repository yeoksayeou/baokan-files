　　Early Weeding Fights Drought and Prevents Pests
    Various Regions Actively Weed Seedlings
    [Our Dispatch] Capitalizing on the experience that "a hoe brings water," various regions are actively engaged in early weeding to combat drought. In Bayi Village, Fifth District of Changzhi, after rectifying and expanding mutual aid teams, a major change of labor was implemented. All 1,652 mu of corn in the village have been weeded, and over 400 mu of millet have also been weeded. After performance evaluations and commendations of models, a mutual aid movement was launched. Groups discussed deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, challenging each other. Zhang Yaohai guaranteed that his group would weed three times, accumulate 300 dan of manure and 400 jin of sesame cakes, and begin fertilizing the corn. They would ensure thorough weeding through mutual aid inspections, and also allocate five laborers to work outside the village during the busy season. Chen Taochi's group proposed that millet weeding should involve "three presses per step, ensuring benefits in both drought and flood," with a press every eight inches, five plants per press, rows straight, and able to roll an egg over the surface. Xu Chunhai's group guaranteed more manure application now, promising to weigh the harvest by the jin in the autumn, and challenged Taochi's group to complete the weeding within ten days. Following the challenges, all groups in the village started working from dawn till dusk. In Hongjing Base Point, First District of Licheng, led by labor hero Fan Jinde and active cadres, a concentrated effort was made to pull seedlings. Within ten days, the entire base point had pulled seedlings on 3,265 mu of millet. Except for over 300 mu of late millet that could not be pulled, all tasks were completed.

    [Another Dispatch] In Han Family Village, Second District of Pingshun, labor hero Guo Shenchang used his own experience to dispel the masses' concerns about early weeding leading to seedling death and pest infestation. He told everyone that early weeding only causes death if it's done too deeply. Early weeding should be very shallow, so that the soil loosens and absorbs sunlight well, and is less prone to pests. Also, pulling out extra seedlings saves nutrients for the remaining ones, so the seedlings can grow stronger. After clearing up these doubts, each group formulated weeding plans, guaranteeing completion by the end of June. In Dong Shizi Ridge Village, Third District, there is a hero cadre mutual aid team that has established a technical committee. The quality of weeding is to be universally inspected, with detailed standards set and grades assigned. Achievements in inspection are recorded for commendation and model selection. Chang Village, Third District of Huguan, has a well-organized mutual aid system. Based on mutual aid, detailed discussions are held regarding specific weeding plans. Work is allocated according to labor, with meticulous weeding guaranteed for three times. Rewards are given to skilled laborers who take on apprentices. The masses are highly enthusiastic, and eighty-eight laborers weeded 300 mu of corn in three days.

　　早锄抗旱防虫害
    各地积极锄苗
    【本报讯】发挥锄头有水经验，早锄抗旱，各地积极开展锄苗。长治五区八义村在整顿扩大互助组后，实行大变工，全村一千六百五十二亩玉茭已全部锄完，并已锄谷四百余亩。经过表功表模，展开了互助运动，各组讨论深耕细作中相互挑战：张窑孩保证他组锄三遍，全组积大粪三百担、麻饼四百斤，并开始奶玉茭，要经互助检查把草锄净，同时抽出五个劳力出外打忙工。陈讨吃组提出锄谷要一步三按、旱涝沾光，一安八寸，每安五棵，横竖有行，滚过鸡蛋。徐春孩组保证现在多上粪，秋后比斤称，并和讨吃组挑战，要在十天内完成锄苗。经挑战后全村各组都起早搭黑干起来。黎城一区洪井基点在劳动英雄范进德和干部积极分子带头下，突击拔苗，十天内全基点已拔完谷三千二百六十五亩，除了三百多亩晚谷不能拔外，已全部完成。

    【又讯】平顺二区韩家劳动英雄郭申长，用自己经验打破群众不肯早锄苗、早锄苗易死肯生虫的顾虑，告诉大家早锄苗死是因为锄的太深，早锄须锄的很浅，这样土松好吸收日光，不易生虫，并且拔去了苗给留下的苗子省养分，苗子就能长的更壮实。思想打通后，各组便分订锄苗计划，保证六月底全部锄完。三区东十字岭村也有英雄干部互助组长成立技术委员会，对锄苗好坏要普遍检查，并细致的订出标准、划分等级，根据检查成绩记功选模范。壶关三区畅村互助组织好，在互助基础上详细讨论锄苗具体计划，按活计工，细锄细作，保证锄三遍，并奖励技术高的好把式带徒弟，群众热情很高，八十八个劳力三天就锄了玉茭三百亩。
