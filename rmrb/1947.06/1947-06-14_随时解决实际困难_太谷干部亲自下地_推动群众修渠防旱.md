　　Solving Practical Difficulties Promptly
    Taigu Cadres Go to the Fields Themselves
    Promoting Canal Repair and Drought Prevention Among the Masses
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] Taigu County district cadres personally help the masses repair canals and irrigate the land, solve various ideological concerns and practical difficulties of the masses, and carry out the drought prevention and sowing movement. Guo’bao Village is close to the Xiangyu River, but the masses are waiting for rain and are unwilling to carry water for sowing. Comrade Yue Wanshou of the County United Cooperative studied the situation and went deep into the masses to research the situation. He learned that the main ideological concern of the masses was that carrying water would take up too much work time. Because it takes one labor to plant one mu of millet with livestock, while it takes two to three labors to plant one mu by carrying water. For land far from the river, three labors are not enough. Planting one mu of land, based on general wages, requires 1.5 dou of rice. The main ideological concern of the masses is that spending too much labor makes it difficult to repay labor and they cannot afford wages. Comrade Yue Wanshou discussed with everyone and adopted the method of rotating planting to try to repay labor with labor. For example, if there are five households in a group, each household plants five mu, they can exchange labor with each other without paying wages. Everyone plants some land and feels at ease. When organizing women to participate in planting, the masses were concerned that others would seduce their women. Comrade Wanshou grasped this thought of the masses and organized the men, women, old and young of one family into a group. The full laborers carried water and dug pits, the semi-laborers filled pits, and the women and children watered and sowed seeds. They were all very energetic and gave full play to the role of each laborer. At the same time, county and district cadres personally participated in and helped the masses with canal repair and irrigation work. The county government left the office staff (more than 20 people) to help the masses of Xia Yaozi Xiang Village open canals and repair irrigated land, using a total of 35 laborers to repair 30 mu of land. The canal repaired by Guanzhai Village in the Third District can irrigate more than 90 mu of land. In organizing this work, we combined it with publicizing our tax collection policy, using the comparison method of comparing the yield of irrigated and dry land to dispel the masses' fear of paying too much burden. In specific organization, we paid attention to allocating labor according to the amount of land and minimizing the hiring of people to solve and reduce the difficulty of the masses being unable to afford wages. Villages also established a unified leadership organization, with district cadres directly participating in organizing and guiding this work. For example, Liang, the head of the Third District, led the masses of Tasi Village to water the land with waterwheels for sowing. The masses expressed their unwillingness because they had to give people good food when using waterwheels, which was labor-intensive and costly. Poor people could not afford to use waterwheels. District Head Liang called everyone together to discuss a solution. Everyone believed that good food would make everyone's life difficult, so it was stipulated that only one meal would be eaten in the morning (the rest would be their own), and whatever was available would be eaten, and wages would be settled according to general wages. Everyone was satisfied with this. More than 20 households irrigated more than 10 mu in one day. After some villages in the Third District finished planting the irrigated land, they could not sow the dry land, so they organized to repair the beach land. For example, the masses in Pangzhuang said, "If dry land cannot be planted, repairing two mu of beach land can still provide food, which is better than relying on the heavens for food." They repaired the beach land in the Wuma River area, and one household had already repaired two mu. Villages in Xianglin area that do not rely on the river only have dry land, so they called for early planting. Xue Hengyong, chairman of the District Relief Association, personally led the masses to plant dry land and put forward the slogan "Let the seeds wait for the rain, don't let the rain wait for the seeds," organizing the masses to plant early and dry-plant while taking advantage of the opportunity.

    [This newspaper, Licheng News] The Yuanquan Joint Defense in the Fifth District, with a total of nine administrative villages, all completed the sowing work on May 27th, and immediately turned to weeding seedlings, concentrating their efforts to fight against the drought. For example, under the slogan of applying fertilizer to the tops of millet on mountain ridges, 21 mu of millet, 32 mu of hemp, and 30 mu of cotton were organized to be weeded, and five drought canals were dug. Yuanzhuang opened a canal more than 160 steps long and three feet wide, which can irrigate 41 mu of land. Dongluotuo repaired 25 water wells, and Xiluotuo dug a hemp pond to prevent drought and overcome the difficulty of obtaining water.

　　随时解决实际困难
    太谷干部亲自下地
    推动群众修渠防旱
    【本报太行讯】太谷县区干部亲自动手，帮助群众修渠浇地，解决群众各种思想顾虑、具体困难，开展了防旱下种运动，郭堡村靠近像峪河，但群众都在等雨，不愿担水下种。县联社岳万寿同志根据这种情况，便深入群众中作研究，了解到群众的主要思想顾虑，是怕担水误工多。因为牲口种一亩谷需工一个，担水种一亩即需二个到三个，离河远的地三个工还不行。种一亩就以一般工资计，需一斗五升米，群众主要的思想顾虑就是花工太多，还不了工，出不起工资。岳万寿同志就和大家讨论，采取轮流种的办法，尽量做到工还工，例如一个组五户，每户种了五亩，这样可以以工拨工，不用出工资，大家都种了点，也都安心了。组织妇女参加点种时，群众有怕别人诱惑自己女人的顾虑，万寿同志摸准了群众这种思想，便把一家的男女老少组织到一个组里，全劳力担水刨坑，半劳力埋坑，妇女、儿童浇水播籽，劲头都很大，也发挥了各个劳力的作用。同时，县区干部亲自参加与帮助了群众的修渠浇地工作，县政府留机关人员（二十多人），全体帮助下窑子项村群众开渠修水地，共用工三十五个，修地三十亩。三区官寨村修的渠可浇九十多亩地。在组织这一工作上，结合宣传我们的征收政策，用水旱地产量对比办法打通群众怕多出负担的思想，具体组织上注意了按地亩出工，尽量少雇人，解决与减少群众出不起工资的困难。村与村又成立了统一的领导组织，由区干部直接参加，组织指导这一工作。如三区梁区长领导塔寺村群众车水浇地下种，群众表示不愿意，因为车水需给人家吃好饭，费工又多，贫苦群众车不起、梁区长就召集大家讨论办法，都认为吃的好了大家困难，规定光早上吃一顿饭（其余吃自己）有什吃什，工资按一般工资结算，这样大家都满意了，二十多户一天内就浇了十余亩。三区有的村子种完水地后，旱地无法下种，就组织起来修滩地，如庞庄群众说：“旱地种不上，修上二亩滩地也能有吃的，比靠天吃饭强。”他们就在乌马河一带修滩地，有一户已修了二亩。香林一带不靠河的村，光有旱地，就号召早种、区救联主席薛恒永同志亲自领导群众干种，并提出：“能让籽等雨、不让雨等籽”的口号，组织群众早种、干种趁垧不趁节。

    【本报黎城讯】五区源泉联防，共有九个行政村，全部于五月二十七日，先后完成下种工作，即刻转上锄苗，集中力量和旱灾作斗争。如山岭在谷锄寸顶上肥的口号下，有组织的锄谷二十一亩，锄大麻三十二亩，锄棉花三十亩，挑了五道旱渠。元庄开渠一道，计长一百六十多步，三尺宽，可浇地四十一亩。东骆驼修理水井二十五眼，西骆驼挑大麻池一个，防御天旱，并克服吃水的困难。
