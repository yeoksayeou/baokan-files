　　Taiyue Announces Compensation Measures for Livestock Losses of Participating Masses
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 24th] The Taiyue Administrative Office recently announced the following decision regarding compensation for livestock losses incurred by the masses participating in the war effort through labor service and voluntary transportation: For livestock that die during the period of service for war participation, labor service, and voluntary transportation, compensation will be fairly assessed based on the circumstances of the death and the household situation of the livestock owner, ranging from 70% to full compensation. For animals that are injured and, despite treatment, completely lose their ability to work, compensation will be appropriately assessed at 60% to 80%. In cases where services are rendered on the battlefield encountering unforeseen events or being seized by the enemy, compensation will be provided at 70% to full compensation, after verification. For livestock hired at market prices, if they die during the period of hire, appropriate compensation of 50% to 70% will be provided; for animals that are injured but completely lose their ability to work despite treatment, appropriate compensation of 40% to 60% will be provided; for those that lose half their working ability, compensation of 20% to 30% will be provided.
