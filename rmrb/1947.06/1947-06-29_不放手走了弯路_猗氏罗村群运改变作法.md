　　Taking a Detour by Not Letting Go
    Luo Village, Yishi, Changes Approach to Mass Movement
    [Our Taiyue dispatch, 27th] Luo Village, in the first district of Yishi, is a large village with 500 households. The feudal forces were strong. When the land reform began, some people approached us, talked about the situation, and complained. Unexpectedly, they later turned to perfunctory behavior and evasion. After careful review by the leadership, the reasons why the masses did not approach us were found: (1) Simple investigation without mobilization. People were first asked: "How many acres of land do you have?" The masses were afraid, thinking that it was going to be communized. (2) Individual bad elements used the name of the peasant association to scare the masses, and even secretly slandered the peasant association as a "compilation village," making the masses afraid of the peasant association. 3. In the process of complaining, the masses put forward some targets for struggle, but they were not resolved, and they felt that it was useless to raise them. At the same time, when things that were considered irrelevant to land reform were encountered, they were ignored even if they were raised, waiting for the masses to become conscious. After the cadres accepted these experiences, they proposed (bracing themselves and getting to the heart of things, working with the masses, solving problems as they arose, and promoting land reform from general work. First, they helped the masses to reap and thresh wheat. No matter how big or small the matter, they were solved as soon as the masses raised it, so as to open up relations with the masses. The masses felt that the peasant association was useful, so they raised all kinds of matters, and found that the most urgent and universal demand of the masses was the unfair burden of corvée labor, and found the key to breakthrough. Just at the time of wheat harvesting, the county government dispatched 64 stretcher bearers, and the village government had not yet been transformed. The people who were dispatched were the poor people who often bore the burden of corvée labor and did not dare to resist. Therefore, these suffering people came to the peasant association one by one to seek justice. The work team supported the masses and emboldened them to launch a struggle. The masses angrily said, "Those who have money, power, and face, who has ever borne corvée labor?" After the masses had brewed and organized themselves, the leaders let the masses go to the village government to reason with them and calculate the corvée accounts. On June 7, 8, and 9, a movement against unfair corvée labor of more than 120 people was launched. The masses gathered at the village government and reasoned with the village chief and deputy. The village chief and deputy were at a loss for words and had to increase the number of corvée laborers from 106 to 280, and revised the extremely unfair method of collecting grain according to land area in the past to a scoring system, with some paying more and others not paying at all. After the victory of this struggle, the masses said, "With more people and strength, no one is afraid. This time, it is not the world of the Second War Zone." Immediately afterwards, a meeting of activists was convened to mobilize the poor to thoroughly turn themselves over and realize "land to the tiller." At present, the poor are being mobilized to unite and carry out a full-village struggle.

　　不放手走了弯路
    猗氏罗村群运改变作法
    【本报太岳二十七日电】猗氏一区罗村是个有五百户人家的大村子，封建势力强大，土地改革开始时，还有些人和我们接近，谈情况，诉苦，不料后来竟变成应付躲避，经过领导上细心检讨。才找出群众不接近我们的原因：（一）单纯调查而不发动，见人就先问：“你有几亩地？”群众害怕，以为要共产。（二）有个别坏蛋拿上农会的名字去吓唬群众，甚而暗地侮蔑农会是编村，使群众对农会害怕。三、在诉苦中，群众提出了一些斗争对象，但没有得到解决，认为提也不顶事。同时遇见认为与土地改革无关的事情，虽然提出也置之不理，死等着群众觉悟。干部接受了这些经验后，就提出（硬着头皮钻，和群众一块滚、有问题就解决，从一般工作中推动土地改革。先帮助群众割麦、打麦，不管大小事情，群众一提就给解决，这样打通和群众的关系。群众都觉得农会顶事，于是大小事情都提出来了，从中发现了一个群众普遍的迫切要求支差不公，找见了突破的关键，正在收麦时候，恰巧县府派下担架民夫六十四人，该村村公所还未改造，派的都是常支差的不敢反抗的穷人，因此这些苦人们便都一个一个的来找农会作主，工作队即给群众撑腰壮胆发动斗争。群众气愤着说：“有钱有势有面子的，那个支过差呢？”群众酝酿组织好以后，领导上就让群众自己去和村公所讲理，并算差帐，于六月七、八、九三日掀起了一百二十余人的反支差不公运动，群众齐集到村公所和村长副讲理，把永没支过差的人也都一一的提出来了，村长副理曲词穷，只得把支差人数从一百零六人增加到二百八十人，又修改了过去极端不公道的按地亩起款征粮办法，改为评分负担，有的多出，没的不出，经过这次斗争的胜利，群众说：“人多势众，谁也不怕，这一回可不是二战区的天下了。”紧接着就召开积极分子会议，发动穷人彻底翻身，实现耕者有其田，目前正发动苦人联苦人，进行全村的大斗争。
