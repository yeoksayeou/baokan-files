Short Commentary:

　　Settle Accounts, Distribute Land, All at Once
    In recent months, the work in the newly recovered areas of our region has been progressing rapidly and well. Ye County is a newly established county, and in just over a month, by focusing on the central link: boldly mobilizing the masses, the masses in 143 villages have taken action, overthrown landlords and local bullies, distributed the wheat and land of landlords and local bullies, and activists are emerging in batches, and the leadership groups of the masses themselves are also taking shape. This is a major victory and deserves commendation.
    Like the successful experiences of other regions, the most important point for the rapid development and achievement of the mass movement in Ye County is that they focused on meeting the demands of the masses. The masses hated landlords and local bullies, demanded food to eat, and land to cultivate. They led the masses to overthrow landlords and local bullies, and to settle accounts, distribute wheat and land all at once. Also, like the experiences of other places, the masses in the newly recovered areas were initially warm at heart (wanting land) but cold on the surface (afraid of landlords) towards us. However, as long as we boldly meet the peasants' demands, support them from above—suppressing and confiscating—and mobilize them from below—settling accounts and speaking out about grievances—advancing on both fronts, the situation can be quickly broken open. These experiences are still worth continuing to promote in various places, so that the work in the newly recovered areas can be carried out on a larger scale.

　　清算分田一锅端
    近月以来，我区各地新收复区工作开展得很快，开展得很好；邺县是新建县，短短一个多月，由于抓紧了中心一环：放手发动群众，已有百四十三村群众行动起来，斗倒了地主、奸霸，分配了地主、奸霸的麦子和田产，积极分子正在一批一批涌现，群众自己的领导集团也在形成中。这是一个重大的胜利，值得予以表扬。
    和其他地区的成功经验一样：邺县群运所以能迅速开展与获得成绩，最重要的一点，就是他们抓紧满足了群众的要求，群众痛恨地主奸霸，要求有粮食吃，要求有地种，他们便领导群众斗倒地主奸霸，诉苦清算分麦分田一锅端。也和其他地方的经验一样：新收复区群众开头对我们是心里热（要土地）表面冷（怕地主），但只要放手满足农民的要求，自上而下的撑腰——镇压没收与自下而上的发动——诉苦清算，双头并进，局面即可迅速的轰开。这些经验，在各地仍值得继续发扬，使新收复区的工作更大规模的开展起来。
