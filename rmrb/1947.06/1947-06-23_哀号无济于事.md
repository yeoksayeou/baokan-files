　　Wailing is Useless
    Chiang Kai-shek delivered a "lecture" to his military academy students on the 16th, asking them to bring out the revolutionary spirit of the Whampoa Military Academy's founding twenty-three years ago to save the "nation's woes." His proclamation concealed a major point: he did not mention how the revolutionary spirit of Whampoa came about, and how it was lost.
    In the era when the Kuomintang implemented the three major revolutionary policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and alliance with workers and peasants, the Whampoa Military Academy was once a sacred place for Chinese youth. The Whampoa student army left an immortal history in the two Eastern Expeditions. However, after Chiang Kai-shek launched the March 20th counter-revolutionary coup in 1926, the Whampoa Military Academy suffered a severe blow due to the expulsion of Communist Party members. Although the revolutionary Whampoa Youth Military Association members continued to fight against the reactionaries, they ultimately could not save Whampoa from decline. During the Northern Expedition, the Whampoa First Army, commanded by Liu Zhi, Wang Boling, and the traitor Miao Bin, had the least military achievements and suffered multiple defeats. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek openly betrayed the revolution and directed the Whampoa army to massacre workers and other revolutionary masses in Jiangxi and Shanghai. From then on, Whampoa changed from a revolutionary banner to a counter-revolutionary banner. The so-called Whampoa clique became the base of the fascist Blue Shirts Society and a target of popular condemnation. The revolutionary spirit of Whampoa, which came with the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and with the people's stance, inevitably disappeared from Chiang Kai-shek's ranks after the split between the two parties and the betrayal of the people, just like trying to retrieve a sword by marking a boat. Chiang Kai-shek's lament today certainly cannot summon the soul of Whampoa. In fact, the soul of Whampoa is not dead. It lives in the loyal revolutionary soldiers of the former Whampoa, such as Lin Biao, Xu Xiangqian, and Chen Geng. It lives in the Chinese People's Liberation Army and its military academies. It also lives in the youth in various major cities today who are fighting against civil war, hunger, and atrocities. Among the Whampoa military personnel, anti-war sentiment is now developing, and some of them are brewing anti-Chiang and anti-war actions, seeking refuge in the People's Liberation Army. This situation will definitely develop considerably with the future defeats of Chiang's army; the Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome this development. The true revolutionary spirit of Whampoa belongs only to the revolutionary army that stands on the people's side. This is the fundamental change in things.
    Chiang Kai-shek's proclamation, because it conceals this fundamental change in history, is all turned upside down. What he calls for his students to "revolutionize" is to make them counter-revolutionary. But Chiang Kai-shek can conceal one change, but he cannot conceal another: he declares that his so-called "revolution" has now become very dangerous. And according to his theory, his life should become more and more dangerous as the revolution progresses, and naturally it will be even more dangerous in the future. He admits that the suffering of the people has returned to the era of the Northern Warlords. He also says: "The treacherousness of the revolutionary environment, the increase of counter-revolutionary forces, the obscurity and blockage of doctrines, and the scattered and hesitant state of people's hearts are even worse than at that time." From this, he concludes: "Our position today is that of a lonely minister and an illegitimate son." His words seem a bit difficult to understand at first glance, but they are easy to understand when translated: the pitch black of the counter-revolutionary environment, the radiant brilliance of the revolutionary forces, the constant setbacks of counter-revolutionary propaganda, and the internal division and distress of the rulers all exceed the period of the First Great Revolution. Chiang Kai-shek submitted to Hitler as a subject, but unfortunately he died young; he abandoned his lonely minister and submitted to Truman as a son, which is not very legitimate in terms of kinship and can only be considered an illegitimate son. Chiang Kai-shek still has a pessimistic tone, which he had before, but not publicly. Until recently, the "National Assembly" was convened, the "Constitution" was established, the CCP representatives were driven away, Yan'an was occupied, the government was "reorganized," students were arrested and killed, and the "fruits of the people's victory in the War of Resistance" were robbed by him. At this moment, he saw that change was coming. When the people were forced to have no way to go, they were determined to seek survival in death and determined to counterattack Chiang Kai-shek. The charge of the people's counterattack is like an overwhelming force, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to publicly raise the question of "whether the fruits of the victory in the War of Resistance can be maintained," as well as unlucky words such as "lonely minister and illegitimate son" and "final struggle."
    Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda has been completely chaotic recently, and its characteristic is to cry for help in all directions. The first is to cry for help to the Kuomintang. On March 29, he called to the Youth League, on May 28, he called to the Political Consultative Conference, and a few days later, he called to the military academy students. This is the first characteristic of Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda. The second is to cry for help to the so-called impartial people. The so-called "impartial people" in the past had to completely support the Kuomintang, otherwise they would not be pleased by Chiang Kai-shek. Now, in order to save his life, he is in a hurry and cannot choose, and the scale has been greatly relaxed. Sympathizing with the student movement but not approving of strikes is considered "impartial." Saying that Chiang Kai-shek is wrong, but the CCP also has its faults, is considered "impartial." Saying that "Chiang Kai-shek is like the white-clad scholar Wang Lun, and the CCP is like Leopard Head Lin Chong" is considered "impartial." Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine, after hearing these words, not only does not feel taboo, but also regards them as treasures, touting them and asking the people of the world to learn from these so-called "impartial people" and come out to "uphold justice" for them. This is the second characteristic of Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda. The third is to cry for help to foreign countries. The US-Soviet war is too vague, and even borrowing money is too slow, so first a "Korean Communist" is how and how, then some "Socialist Third Bureau" is how and how; first a "Beita Mountain Incident" is how and how, then "Chabei" is how and how, talking nonsense; the entire Chiang Kai-shek organization has become a rumor-mongering company. The purpose is to call to the Americans and ask them to come out and save their lives. This is the third characteristic of Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda. However, all these cries ultimately fail to achieve the goal of saving lives; there will be a day when they will inevitably shout three times and die. These characteristics of Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda mark that Chiang Kai-shek's ship is about to sink.
    In short, Chiang Kai-shek's defeat and collapse are certain. Chiang Kai-shek is wailing for this, and there will definitely be more wailing proclamations published in the future. But the general trend is gone, and it cannot be reversed. Chiang Kai-shek's entire capital is his regular army of eighty-six divisions (armies) - two hundred and forty-eight brigades (divisions) - of which seventy-five divisions (armies) - two hundred and eighteen brigades (divisions) - are attacking our liberated areas. Three divisions (armies) - eight brigades (divisions) - are attacking our Hunan-Hubei and South China guerrilla areas. All these invading troops have been annihilated by the People's Liberation Army by more than ninety brigades (divisions) in the past year from July last year to the present. The future task is: to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops. As long as this batch of bandit troops is completely annihilated, the Chinese people will win; all Chiang Kai-shek's wailing will be in vain. (June 21st)

### 哀号无济于事

　　哀号无济于事
    蒋介石十六日对他的军校学生发了一篇《训词》，要他们拿出二十三年前黄埔军校创办时的革命精神，来挽救“国家之忧患”。他的文告隐瞒了一个主要的关节，他没有提到黄埔的革命精神是怎样来的，又是怎样去的？
    在国民党实行联苏、联共、联工农三大革命政策的时代，黄埔军校曾经是中国青年的圣地；黄埔学生军在两次东征中，留下了不朽的历史。但到民国十五年蒋介石制造三月二十日反革命政变以后，黄埔军校就因驱逐共产党员而受到严重的打击。革命的黄埔青年军人联合会分子，虽然继续与反动派斗争，终于不能挽救黄埔的没落。在北伐战争中，刘峙、王柏龄和汉奸缪斌等所指挥的黄埔第一军，战功最微，而且打了多次败仗。民国十六年，蒋介石公开叛变革命，指挥黄埔军在江西和上海屠杀工人和其他革命群众，从此黄埔更由革命的旗帜一变而为反革命的旗帜。所谓黄埔系，成为法西斯团体复兴社的大本营，成为人民唾骂的目标。黄埔的革命精神，既是随着国共合作而来，随着人民立场而来，在国共分裂以后，在背叛人民以后，这种精神就必然从蒋介石的队伍中一去不返，好比刻舟不能求剑。蒋介石今天的哀歌，当然也不能替黄埔招魂。其实黄埔的魂并没有死，它活在林彪、徐向前、陈赓等等黄埔前身的忠诚革命军人的身上，它活在中国人民解放军及其军校的身上；它也活在今天各大城市中为反内战、反饥饿、反暴行而奋斗的青年们身上。黄埔军人中，现在正发展厌战情绪，其中有些人正在酝酿反蒋、反战，投奔人民解放军。这种情况，随着今后蒋军的失败，必定会有可观的发展；中国人民衷心欢迎这一发展。真正的黄埔革命精神，仅仅属于站在人民立场上的革命军方面，这就是事物的根本变化。
    蒋介石的文告，因为隐瞒历史上的这个根本变化，所以一切都是颠倒着。他所谓要他的学生“革命”，就是要他们反革命。但是蒋介石能隐瞒一个变化，却不能隐瞒另一个变化：他声明他的所谓“革命”，现在是已经变得非常危险了。而按照他的理论，他的命应该愈革愈危险，将来自然是更加危险了。他承认人民之困苦已经回复到北洋军阀时代，他并且说：“革命环境之险恶，反革命势力之增张，主义之晦实否塞，人心之散漫彷徨，视当时乃尤过之”。由此他得到结论：“吾人今日之地位，为孤臣孽子。”他的话初看有些难懂，翻译出来倒是好懂的：反革命环境的漆黑一团，革命势力的光芒万丈，反革命宣传的到处碰壁，统治者内部的分裂苦闷，大都超过了第一次大革命时期。蒋介石投希特勒为臣，不幸他短命死矣；丢下个孤臣投杜鲁门为子，宗族上又不甚合法，只算个孽子。蒋介石还一套悲观腔调，以前也是有的，但都不公开。到了最近，“国大”也开了，“宪法”也立了，中共代表也赶了，延安也占了，政府也“改组”了，学生也捉了杀了，报纸也封了，人民“抗战胜利之成果”被他抢劫完了。正在这时，他看到变化到来了，人民被迫无路可走时，决心死里求生，决心向蒋介石反攻。人民反攻的冲锋声，有如排山倒海，逼得蒋介石不能不公开提出“抗战胜利的成果能否保持”的疑问，以及“孤臣孽子”呀、“最后奋斗”呀等等倒霉话。
    蒋介石的宣传，近来完全乱了，其特点是向各方面乱叫救命。第一是向国民党乱叫救命。三月二十九日向青年团叫，五月二十八日向参政会叫，没有几天，就又向军校学生叫。这是蒋介石宣传的第一个特点。第二是向所谓公正人士乱叫救命。以前的所谓“公正人士”，一定是要完全拥护国民党的，否则不为蒋介石所欢喜。现在为了救命，急不暇择，尺度是大大放宽了。同情学生运动，但不赞成罢课，这也就算“公正”了。说蒋介石不对，但中共也有不是处，这也就算“公正”了。说“蒋介石好比白衣奇士王伦，中共好比豹子头林冲”，这也就算“公正”了。蒋介石的宣传机关听了这些话，非但不觉得犯讳，而且如获至宝，拿来大吹大擂，要求普天下人都能学这些所谓“公正人士”的样子，出来替他们“主持公道”。这是蒋介石宣传的第二个特点。第三是向外国乱叫救命。美苏战争太渺茫了，就是借款也来得太慢，于是左一个“韩共”如何如何，右一个什么“社会主义第三局”如何如何；左一个“北塔山事件”如何如何，右一个“察北”如何如何，胡言乱语；整个蒋介石机构，一齐变成了造谣公司。目的都是叫给美国人听，请他们出来救命。这是蒋介石宣传的第三个特点。但是，一切这些乱叫，到底达不到救命的目的；会有一天终不免大叫三声而亡。蒋介石宣传方面的这些特点，标志着蒋介石航船快要沉没。
    总而言之，蒋介石的溃亡局势是确定了，蒋介石正在为此哀号，并且今后一定还有更多的哀号文告发表。但是大势已去，不能挽回了。蒋介石的全部本钱，是他的正规军八十六个师（军）——二百四十八个旅（师）——其中有七十五个师（军）——二百十八个旅（师）——，是进攻我解放区的。三个师（军）——八个旅（师）——，是进攻我湘鄂及华南游击区的。所有这些进犯军队，在去年七月至现在将近一个年头内，已被人民解放军歼灭九十多个旅（师）。今后的任务是：坚决彻底干净全部地歼灭一切蒋介石进犯军。只要这批匪军歼灭干净了，中国人民就胜利了；蒋介石一切哀号都是徒然。（六月二十一日）
