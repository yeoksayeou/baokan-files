　　Saint Buddha Hall's Emancipated Peasants
    Discuss Giving Priority to Paying Public Grain
    [Reported from our Jinnan office on the 9th] On the evening of the 29th of last month, all members of the peasant association in Saint Buddha Hall, Weixian County, were brewing ideas about the wheat harvest. Zhang Jitang's group proposed: "To ensure the continued expansion of the front line's victory, the most important task for the masses after the wheat harvest is to pay public grain. Our group guarantees that the wheat we pay this year will be winnowed by a winnowing machine, that we will pay clean, pay well, and pay early, completing the payment within one day." Labor hero Shi Decai and Geng Lanyu's group, and Guo Xuewei's group all proposed that, in addition to agreeing with Zhang Jitang's suggestion, they also guaranteed to pay the public grain in half a day, sending it to the district office for urgent transfer to the soldiers at the front. At this point, all members of the peasant association unanimously agreed, and the entire village strived to complete the task of paying public grain within half a day.

　　圣佛堂翻身农民
    讨论尽先缴公粮
    【本报冀南九日电】上月二十九日晚，威县圣佛堂全体农会员酝酿收麦时，张济堂组提出：“要保证前线的胜利继续扩大，麦收后群众最主要的任务就是缴公粮，俺们组保证今年缴的麦子要用风车扇过，缴的净、缴的好，缴的早，一天内缴完。”劳动英雄石德才及耿兰玉组、郭雪维组纷纷提出除了同意张济堂的意见外，并保证半天缴完公粮，送往区公所急转前方将士，至此全体农会员一致同意，全村争取半天内完成缴公粮的任务。
