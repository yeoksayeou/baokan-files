　　Liushenggou Coal Mine Workers Help Harvest Wheat
    Neiqiu Chengguan Merchants Participate in Watering and Planting

    [This newspaper dispatch] When Liushenggou Coal Mine workers were studying and carrying out the great production movement to support the front lines, after heated discussions, everyone clarified that workers and peasants are one family, flesh and blood are related. Peasants join the army and provide stretcher bearers, we must do our best to help them with production. It was unanimously proposed that as the wheat ears are ripening, we should help the masses in nearby villages, especially the families of soldiers, with the wheat harvest. The campaign to help with harvesting and rush planting officially began on the 30th. In order to ensure that both work and helping with the harvest are taken into account, it was decided that those working the long shift (nine hours) would use the time from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM, and those working the short shift (eight hours) would use the time from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM as the harvesting time, for five consecutive days. Apart from those who had to stay at their jobs, 56 people participated, harvesting a total of 58 mu of wheat. The amount harvested for individual landlords has not yet been counted.

    [This newspaper dispatch from Neiqiu] The Neiqiu Industry and Commerce Bureau, responding to the district party committee's call for drought prevention, convened a merchants' meeting in Chengguan to mobilize them. After everyone's discussion, it was recognized that merchants and peasants are one family. "If the peasants have no grain money, the merchants' business will not prosper." Only by organizing together and helping each other can we develop smoothly. This broke the phenomenon of division between merchants and peasants that had existed for more than four thousand years. A total of 132 shops in Chengguan, except for each shop keeping one or two elderly people to maintain store operations, the rest were organized into groups and went to village cadres in each street to help the masses with watering and planting. In two days, a total of 156 workdays were contributed, helping the masses with watering and planting a total of 67 mu.

　　六盛沟煤矿职工帮助收麦
    内邱城关商人参加浇地点种
    【本报讯】六盛沟煤矿职工在学习开展大生产运动支援前线时，经过热烈的讨论后，大家明确了：工农是一家，骨肉相关，农民参军出担架，我们要尽力帮助他们生产。一致提出麦穗将熟，要帮助驻地附近村庄群众，特别是抗属麦收，助收抢种运动乃于三十日正式开始。为使工作助收互相兼顾，特决定上大班（九小时）者以早五点至八点，上小班（八小时）者以下午二点至六点为助收时间，连续五日，除坚持必不可离的工作者外，参加人数五十六名，共割麦子五十八亩，个别同志给房东割的尚未统计在内。

    【本报内邱讯】内邱工商管理局响应区党委防旱号召，召开了城关商人大会，进行动员，经大家讨论后，认清了商人农民是一家人，“农民没了粮食钱，商人买卖不发财”，只有大家组织起来互相帮助才能顺利发展，打破了四千余年来商人农民分裂现象。城关商店共一百三十二户，除各商店留老年一人至二人坚持门市营业外，其余组织起来划分小组，自动到各街找村干部，帮助群众浇地点种。两天共帮工一百五十六个工，给群众浇地、点种共六十七亩。
