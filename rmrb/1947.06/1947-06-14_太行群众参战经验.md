　　The Experience of the Taihang Masses Participating in the War
    Taihang Branch
    During the recent campaigns in Northern Henan and Zhengtai, nearly 200,000 militiamen and self-defense forces from the Taihang area went to the front lines to participate in the war. The scale, precision of organization, and richness of innovation fully demonstrated the enthusiasm, organization, and creativity of the broad masses of peasants after they had completely turned themselves around through land reform on the basis of political consciousness. Throughout the participation in the war, the spirit of "accurate calculation, rational use" was consistently implemented. As a result, great achievements were made in saving manpower. On the Zhengtai line, one soldier was supported by one civilian, while in Northern Henan, two civilians supported three soldiers or one civilian supported two soldiers. After precise calculation and strict rectification on the front lines of Northern Henan, more than 47,000 participating masses quickly returned home to production. The main experiences are as follows:

    I. Unified leadership, strict organization, and complete militarization.

    Taking the combat area as a unit, a logistics command was organized (in Northern Henan, it was jointly composed of the military region and ×; on the Zhengtai line, it was composed of the × sub-district). Unified command was exercised, and logistics leadership departments were also specially set up at the county, district, and village levels. From the military region level to the village level, leaders at all levels participated in person, thus forming a strong organization. The organization of the participating masses was completely militarized. Stretcher teams, transportation teams, demolition teams, and militia were all organized according to regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. The squad was the most basic organization, and was often staffed with active elements who had turned themselves around, playing a backbone role. In order to make deployment flexible, stretcher teams could be divided into three categories: accompanying the army, transferring, and mobile; transportation teams were also divided into fixed, mobile, and voluntary. The demolition teams used themselves as the backbone, combined with the masses in newly recovered areas and technical workers to carry out their work.

    II. Accurate calculation, rational use of manpower.

    (1) Ideologically, the logistics departments and the command organs at all levels of the troops established a unified understanding of both completing combat missions and saving manpower. They constantly strengthened cadre education and resolutely overcame the practices of daring to take responsibility for participating in the war but not for saving manpower, and of fearing that they would not be able to find laborers when the war came, so they asked for more laborers than they needed.

    (2) Close contact between the front and the rear. Manpower was adjusted and deployed at any time according to the operational intentions, overcoming the contradiction between the concentrated mobile warfare of large units and the decentralized supply environment in rural areas. In the early stages of the Northern Henan campaign, due to insufficient contact between the front and rear, and a lack of precise calculation, manpower mobilization was large and waste was considerable. During the Junxian-Huaxian campaign, the front and rear had better contact, and after scientific calculation, more than 47,000 laborers were saved.

    (3) Manpower should be concentrated in the column for mobile use, rather than being evenly distributed among the brigades and regiments. The disadvantages of even distribution are: manpower that is not fighting is idle, while those fighting major battles feel insufficient. The combat missions of each brigade and regiment are different, and the manpower required is also different. The main attack troops need more, and the pre-attack troops need less. In the later stages of the Northern Henan campaign, after concentrated column mobile use, the manpower used was less than half of what it had been in the past.

    (4) Implement dual-use and ensure that neither direction travels empty. The military region utilized the laborers who delivered grain to the front to carry back captured materials and weapons, saving more than 3,000 laborers. The field health department used to have stretchers parked, while another group of people were specifically responsible for miscellaneous tasks. After calculating precisely and calling up the idle stretchers, more than 300 laborers were freed up from miscellaneous tasks and returned home to production.

    (5) Combine permanent and temporary forces. The manpower needed by each department does not have to be completely concentrated according to needs. Only concentrate a part of the permanent manpower, and then organize the laborers in the surrounding villages. When the permanent manpower is not enough, temporarily call up laborers from nearby villages.

    (6) Repair roads for vehicles, use large carts instead of manpower, and use mules instead of stretchers. For example, after the ×× supply station increased the number of large carts, it saved more than 3,000 laborers per day.

    III. Combining participation in the war with production, ensuring that neither is neglected.

    1. The entire village undergoes a major labor exchange (i.e., a major labor exchange between the front and rear). The land of the masses participating in the war is cultivated by the masses at home. A system of mutual reporting of merits and mutual inspection between the front and rear is implemented, ensuring that both participation in the war and production are not neglected.

    2. The masses participating in the war seize the gaps in the war on the front lines to help the local masses with production, such as delivering manure, plowing the land, cultivating the land, collecting firewood, and carrying coal. For example, the Xiyang stretcher team collected firewood, which not only solved its own food expenses, but also comforted the troops with more than 10,000 catties, while also reducing the burden on the local masses.

    3. The entire sub-district coordinates forces. Arrangements are made appropriately according to the different natural conditions of mountainous and plain areas, and the early or late sowing periods. For example, He Shun in the Second Sub-district had an earlier sowing period, so it did not participate in the initial participation in the war, allowing it to concentrate its efforts on rushing to sow. When He Shun had almost finished sowing, and the sowing period for Xiyang and Pingding arrived, the masses of He Shun were organized to participate in the war, and Xiyang and Pingding were able to withdraw a large number of laborers to sow.

    IV. Implementing political work throughout participation in the war.

    Before the large-scale participation in the war, in-depth mobilization of war consciousness was carried out in various places. The masses clarified "why participate in the war, for whom to participate in the war," and "turning over and overthrowing Little Chiang (landlords), participating in the war to overthrow Old Chiang." Participation in the war was closely linked to protecting the good times. The masses called this participation in the war a joint struggle of the people of more than ten counties against the reactionaries, which is the reason for the unprecedented enthusiasm for this participation in the war. In action, comparative education was constantly carried out (comparing the hardships of the troops' operations with the participating masses, comparing the lives of the people in the old areas with the people in the border areas), which solved the problem of whether participation in the war was hard or not, and also enlightened the participating masses' consciousness of maintaining discipline. Timely and realistic education, and the broadcasting of victory news anytime and anywhere, greatly encouraged the morale of the masses.

    The movement of the people loving the people and the people loving the soldiers (called "repaying gratitude" in Northern Henan) was a new creation in this participation in the war. The movement of the people loving the people was for the participating masses to help the local masses as much as possible. The main contents were: helping production, helping to turn over, helping to do flexible labor, saving for disaster relief, and engaging in their own production to reduce the burden on the local masses. The slogans on the front lines of Northern Shaanxi were: "Do whatever the local masses need," and "Help with whatever you can do"; the slogans of the Zhengtai were: "Farmers of the world are one family, border areas and hinterland are one family." The development of this movement not only reduced the burden on the local masses, but also made the front and rear masses closely united and reduced many of the difficulties of the participating masses. In particular, helping to turn over was surprisingly effective. Many active members of the stretcher teams were active members during the turn-over movement. They used their own suffering to introduce how to fight the landlords, how to achieve victory, and the happy scenery after turning over. The broad masses of participants became good cadres for turning over. The slogan in Cixian was: "When carrying a stretcher, you are a comfort group, and when stationed, you are a turn-over team." The villages where the stretcher teams of the county were stationed were all helped to turn over. For example, the × stretcher team in Junxian Jiamufo helped the masses to connect and complain about their suffering, and overthrew a big tyrant. The masses recovered 200 dan of black beans, 33 zhang of cloth, and more than 2,200 catties of cotton. The movement of the people loving the soldiers (repaying gratitude) was mainly manifested in organizing frontline rescue. For example, the frontline rescue team led by Liu Shaoqing of Cixian rescued 17 wounded soldiers in the face of the enemy's dense machine gun fire when attacking Tangyin City. During the transportation, the stretcher team was also a nursing team, and they took great care of the wounded soldiers.

    The widespread development of the merit-making movement was also a feature of this participation in the war. Each unit established a mutual-aid merit-making committee, and merit-making was implemented in all actions. Everyone made merit, helped each other to make merit, and the mass recording of merit, comparison of merit, and commendation of merit gave full play to the masses' high degree of creativity and enthusiasm. In order to make merit, the demolition team did not care about eating, and demolished the blockhouse in one breath. The transportation team did not sleep at night, and rushed to transport grain to the front line. The stretcher team rescued the wounded, regardless of their lives, which became a powerful guarantee for the entire action. As for the mutual publicity and encouragement of the masses and the countless creations in working methods, it has formed an unprecedented great mass participation in the war and countless touching facts, which have created the most valuable experience and conditions for future participation in the war.

　　太行群众参战经验
    太行分社
    在此次豫北，正太两大战役中，太行区民兵、自卫队奔赴前线参战的近廿万人，规模之宏大，组织之精密，创造之丰富，均充分表现了广大农民经过土地改革彻底翻身后，在政治觉悟基础上所发挥积极性、组织性与创造性。在参战过程中，始终贯串着“精确计算，合理使用”的精神。因而民力节省有很大成绩，正太线做到了一兵一夫，豫北做到了三兵两夫或两兵一夫。豫北前线经精确计算，严格整顿后，有四万七千余参战群众迅速返家生产。其主要经验如下：
    一、统一领导，严密组织，一切军事化。
    以作战地区为单位，组织后勤指挥部（豫北由军区与×共同组成；正太线由×分区组成）。统一指挥，县、区、村各级亦专设有后勤领导部门。从军区级到村级，都由各级领导者亲自参加，因而构成强有力的机构。在参战群众的组织上是一切军事化。担架队、运输队、破击队、民兵都按团、营、连、排、班编制。班是最基层的组织，多配有翻身积极分子，起骨干作用。为使运用灵活，担架队可分随军、转运、机动三类；运输队也分固定、机动、义运三类；破击队以本身为骨干，结合新收复区群众及技术工人共同进行。
    二、精确计算，合理使用民力。
    （一）在思想上后勤部门与部队各级指挥机关，都树立了既完成作战任务，又节省民力的统一认识。随时加强干部教育，坚决克服敢对参战负责不敢对节约民力负责，和怕战争到来抓不到民夫就多要民力的做法。
    （二）前方与后勤密切联系。随时根据作战意图调整与配备民力，克服了大兵团集中的运动战与农村分散环境供应的矛盾。豫北作战初期，因前后联系不够，没有精确计算，民力动员很大，浪费不小。浚滑战役时，前后联系较好，经过科学计算，节省出民力四万七千余。
    （三）民力集中于纵队机动使用，不平均分配于各旅团。平均分配的坏处是：暂不打仗的民力闲着，打大仗的却感不足，各旅团作战任务不同，所需民力也不同，主攻部队需用多，预攻部队需用少。豫北战役后期，集中纵队机动使用后，所用民力还不及过去一半。
    （四）实行两用与两不空。军区利用往前方送粮民夫背回的缴获物资武器等即合民力三千余人。野战卫生部，过去常有担架停着，却另有一部分人专支杂差，后把停用的担架精确计算调用，即腾出支杂差民力三百余返家生产。
    （五）常备与临时结合。各部门所需民力，不必按需要完全集中起来，只集中一部分常备的，再将周围村庄的民夫组织好，常备的不够时，临时调用附近村庄的即可。
    （六）修通车路，以大车代人力，以毛驴代担架。如××兵站增加大车后，每日即节省民力三千余。
    三、参战与生产结合做到两不误。
    １、全村大变工（即前后方大变工），参战群众的土地，由在家群众给种，实行前后方互相报功，互相检查。做到了参战生产两不误。
    ２、参战群众在前线抓住战争空隙，帮助当地群众进行送粪、刨地、耕地、打柴、担煤等生产。如昔阳担架队打柴，除解决了自身菜钱外，还慰劳了部队万余斤，同时也减轻了当地群众的负担。
    ３、全分区调剂力量。按山地、平地气候不同，下种迟早的自然条件适当安排。如二分区和顺下种期早，首期参战时即未参加，让其集中全力突击下种。和顺下种差不多了，昔阳、平定下种期到，就组织和顺群众参战，昔阳、平定就能抽回大批劳力下种。
    四、贯彻参战始终的政治工作。
    大参战前，各地都进行了战争自觉的深入动员，群众明确了“为啥参战，为谁参战”，“翻身打垮了小蒋（地主），参战为了打垮老蒋”。参战与保卫好时光密切联系，群众把这次参战称之为十余县人民对反动派的联合大斗争，是这次参战空前踊跃的原因。在行动中不断的进行了对比教育（拿部队作战的艰苦与参战群众比，拿老区群众生活与边地群众比），解决了参战苦不苦的问题，也启发了参战群众维持纪律的自觉。及时的实事教育，胜利消息随时随地的广播，大大鼓舞了群众的情绪。
    民爱民与民爱兵（在豫北叫报恩）运动，是这次参战的新创造。民爱民运动是参战群众尽一切可能帮助当地群众，其主要内容是：帮助生产、帮助翻身、帮助做灵活、节约救灾、自己生产，减轻当地群众负担。陕北前线的口号是：“当地群众需要啥就干啥”，“自己会干啥就帮助啥”；正太们的口号是：“天下农民是一家，边地腹地是一家”，这一运动的开展，不仅减轻了当地群众的负担，而且使前后群众亲密团结，减少了参战群众的许多困难。尤其帮助翻身，收效惊人，许多担架队的积极分子就是翻身运动时的积极分子，他们用访自己的苦，介绍怎样与地主斗争，如何取得胜利，以及翻身后的快乐光景。广大的参战群众，都成了良好的翻身干部。磁县的口号是：“抬担架时是慰问团，驻下就是翻身队”。该县担架队所驻村庄，都进行帮助翻身。如×担架队在浚县贾木佛帮助群众串通诉苦，斗垮了一个大恶霸，群众收回了黑豆二百石，布三十三丈、棉花二千二百余斤。民爱兵（报恩）运动主要表现为组织火线抢救，如磁县刘绍清带领的火线抢救组，在打汤阴城时，冒着敌人密集的机枪扫射，抢救出十七个负伤战士。在运送途中，担架队即是看护队，对受伤战士爱护备至。
    立功运动的普遍开展，也是这次参战行动上的特色，各单位都成立有互助立功委员会，立功贯彻到所有的行动中，人人立功，互助立功，群众性的记功，比功，表功，发挥了群众高度的创造与积极性。为了立功，破坏队顾不得吃饭，一鼓气刨完炮楼，运输队夜不睡觉，往前线赶运车粮，担架队急救伤员，不顾性命，成为整个行动的有力保证。至若群众的相互宣传鼓励及在工作方法上的数不尽的创造，形成空前伟大的群众参战热潮与无数可歌可泣的事实，尤多为今后参战工作造成了最为宝贵的经验与条件。
