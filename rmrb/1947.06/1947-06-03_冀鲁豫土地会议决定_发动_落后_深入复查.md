Hebei-Shandong-Henan Land Conference Decides to Launch "Backward" Areas into Thorough Re-examination

[Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch, 1st] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Regional Party Committee convened a land conference on the 5th of last month to summarize the land reform movement in the entire region (mainly counties in the Sixth and Eighth Sub-regions and Shouzhang, Fanxian, and Zhangqiu in the Second Sub-region) over the past five months and to arrange for the re-examination work for the second half of the year. Attending the conference were the secretaries of various local party committees, ministers of civil affairs, and secretaries of the county party committees, directors of the joint associations, and directors of women's associations from the Sixth, Eighth, Second, and Fourth Sub-regions. The conference lasted for twelve days. Comrade Pan Fusheng pointed out in his opening remarks the achievements of the land-to-the-tiller movement throughout the region since the joint meeting of the civil affairs ministers of the local party committees in January of this year. At the same time, he pointed out that the movement had not yet been universally deepened, and it was necessary to mobilize the majority of peasants to conduct a re-examination in order to thoroughly eliminate the reactionary landlord class and completely liberate the peasants economically and politically. Then, each county reported on its work. According to statistics from Nanfeng before the second month of the lunar calendar, farmers had already obtained 41,047 mu of land, over 1,270,000 jin of grain, over 30,080,000 yuan in cash, 432 houses, 834 livestock, 520 carts, and over 12,100 large pieces of farm equipment. According to a survey of Mashengzhuang, a good small district (better village), ordinary poor peasants had generally obtained three mu of land (military and workers' families, five or six mu). 633 households had obtained more fruits, accounting for 63% of the population; even those who had obtained fewer fruits, were counted, accounting for 87%. 178 households were struggled against. 2,525 people from peasant associations, women's associations, and children's corps participated in organizations, accounting for 62% of the population, and there were 75 militiamen. In other counties, generally, poor peasants obtained land, and a portion of ill-gotten wealth was distributed. Mass organizations all developed greatly. Shouzhang conducted three rounds of thorough investigation after land distribution, and the re-examination progressed relatively well. Qingfeng, Qingxi, and Puxian paid attention to the development of party work. Guancheng and Puxian did the work of clearly delineating class boundaries, separating peasants from landlords, and raising the political consciousness of the masses. Nanfeng, Qingxi, Yanggu and other counties mobilized women to participate in land reform, which strengthened the movement. Shouzhang did a very good job of educating old village cadres. During the land reform movement, they convened old village cadres who were relatively detached from the masses for training, allowing everyone to recall their own experiences of liberation and reflect on why they had become detached from the masses, which had a great effect, expressing that "they would resolutely work hard when they returned to the village." A director of a peasant association in Wanglou confessed and reflected to the masses after returning to the village, and was very active in investigating ill-gotten wealth, and regained the support of the masses. At the same time, each county also reviewed its own work. For example, in Nanfeng, land reform in the Fourth District was more in-depth, but in more than seventy villages, the masses were only fully mobilized in more than ten villages. The situation in Shou (zhang) and Fan (xian) was not much different, and there were no statistics for other counties. It is estimated that the better and backward villages accounted for a small number, and most were villages in an intermediate state. In his report, Comrade Wang Junyu of the Second Local Party Committee made a very profound analysis of the landlord class, pointing out the reactionary tenacity of the landlord class, who tried to obstruct or control village leadership before the land reform, and tried to alleviate the situation when they saw that it was inevitable, and pretended to bow their heads to paralyze people during the investigation. The pattern was to give up land but not wealth, and give up wealth but not life. They usually took advantage of the different awareness of the masses and the shortcomings of the leadership and cadres to carry out various sabotage activities. When the conference discussed the issue of mobilizing women, everyone agreed that women should be mobilized to participate in the re-examination in the future. First of all, they should unite against the landlords and seek their own liberation from the anti-feudal struggle. This should not be divided into stages, but it is also not an "independent movement." Finally, Comrade Zhang Linzhi made a summary of the conference, pointing out that the land reform movement in the entire region in the past five months had achieved great results. The vast number of poor peasants had obtained land and were given a part of ill-gotten wealth. In many villages, the peasants became masters of their own affairs. In the conscription movement, the peasants enthusiastically signed up to join the army in order to oppose Chiang Kai-shek and defend their land. 40,000 young people in eleven counties throughout the region enthusiastically signed up to join the army. These were all great achievements of the land reform. In addition, the convening of the Peasants' Congress was a major innovation in the leadership of the region. The shortcoming is that we have not followed the mass line enough, which is manifested in the fact that we are not letting go enough in the conscription movement, and the masses in various places have not been mobilized enough. In the future, in the re-examination, we must thoroughly eliminate the landlord class economically and politically, mobilize the "backward" masses and backward villages, block the landlords' "air-raid shelters," unite the middle peasants, mobilize women, and organize the majority of peasants to create a mass re-examination movement. This is the main task in the future. On the issue of organizational leadership, it was proposed to raise the ideological awareness of the liberated peasants, develop the Party in large numbers, educate and train Party members in the village who are detached from the masses, oppose liberalism within the Party, and strengthen village-level work to make it organized and combative.

　　冀鲁豫土地会议决定
    发动“落后”深入复查
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】冀鲁豫区党委于上月五日召开土地会议，总结五个月来全区（主要是六、八分区各县及二分区寿张、范县、张秋）的土地改革运动，布置下半年的复查工作。到会的有各地委书记、民运部长及六、八、二、四分区各县委书记、联合会主任、妇会主任，大会历时十二日。潘复生同志在开会词中指出从今年一月地委民运部长联席会议以来，全区土地还家运动的成绩，同时指出运动还没有普遍深入下去，必须发动农民大多数进行复查，才能彻底的消灭反动的地主阶级，使农民在经济上、政治上完全获得解放。接着即由各县进行汇报。南峰的土地改革运动据旧历二月以前的统计，农民已得土地四万一千零四十七亩，粮食一百廿七万余斤，现款三千零八十余万元，房屋四百三十二间，牲口八百卅四头，大车五百二十辆，农具一万二千一百余大件，据马胜庄一个小区（较好村）的调查，一般贫农均得到了三亩土地（军、工属五六亩），得果实较多的六百三十三户，占人口的百分之六十三，稍得果实的也算在内，占百分之八十七。被斗的一百七十八户。农会、妇会及儿童团等参加组织的群众二千五百二十五人，占人口的百分之六十二，民兵七十五人。其他各县一般是贫农均获得了土地，分了一部分浮财，群众组织皆大发展。寿张分田后搞了三次清查，复查进行的较好。清丰、清西、濮县，注意了发展党的工作。观城、濮县做了划清阶级界线的工作，使农民与地主分开，提高了群众的政治觉悟。南峰、清西、阳谷等县发动妇女参加土地改革，壮大了运动的力量。寿张教育老村干作的很好，他们在土地改革运动中召集比较脱离群众的老村干受训，让大家回忆自己的翻身经过，反省自己为什么脱离群众，收效很大，表示“回到村里要坚决干”。王楼一个农会主任回到村后，向群众坦白反省，查浮财中很积极，又得到了群众的拥护。同时各县也都检讨了自己的工作，如南峰以四区土地改革较深入，可是七十多个村庄里只有十余村群众发动较充分，寿（张）、范（县）情况也相差不多，其他各县无统计。据估计较好的与落后村均占少数，大部分是中间状态的村子。二地委王均予同志在汇报中，对地主阶级作了很深刻的分析，指出地主阶级反动的顽强性，土地改革前设法阻碍或掌握村领导权，及至看到势在必行，则设法减轻，清查中则假装低头，进行麻痹，其规律是舍地不舍财，舍财不舍命。平日则利用群众的觉悟不同，领导上及干部的缺点钻空子，进行各种破坏活动。大会讨论到发动妇女的问题时，大家意见是今后应发动妇女参加复查，首先是一致对地主，从反封建斗争中求得自身解放。不能分阶段，但也不是“独立运动”。最后张霖之同志作大会总结，指出全区五个月来的土地改革运动成绩很大，广大贫苦农民得到了土地，分到了一部分浮财，很多村子农民当了家，在参军运动中农民为了反蒋保田，全区十一个县有四万青年踊跃报名入伍，这都是土地改革伟大的收获。此外，农民大会的召开，是本区领导上的一大创造。缺点是我们走群众路线还很不够，表现在参军运动中还不够放手，各地群众还发动的不够充分。今后进行复查，必须在经济上、政治上彻底消灭地主阶级，发动“落后”群众及落后村，堵死地主的“防空洞”，团结中农，发动妇女，组织农民大多数，造成群众性的复查运动，这是今后的主要任务。在组织领导的问题上，提出提高翻身农民的思想觉悟，大量发展党，教育训练村中脱离群众的党员，反对党内的自由主义，加强村级工作，使之组织化、战斗化。
