　　Pay Attention to Drought Resistance and Insect Control
    Cheyuan Village Carefully Hoes Cotton
    [Report from this newspaper, Licheng] The cotton seedlings in Dongyuan Village are already more than three inches tall, lush and green, and very attractive. On the afternoon of May 25th, the Technical Committee and the hero Lu Jicai collectively studied cotton seedling hoeing techniques. Based on the specific situation this year, they researched the following methods: (1) Use the hoe to break up the soil clumps and level out the cracks in the ground and ant nests, so as to resist drought and preserve moisture; and to kill ants and prevent oily drought. (2) Hoe shallowly: the first hoeing is mainly for weeding and should not be too deep. (3) Hoe when the soil surface is dry; as the saying goes, "Hoe sesame when wet, hoe cotton when dry." Hoe once after each rain, but hoe when the soil surface is dry, otherwise the seedling leaves will be "ge zhua" (damaged). (4) In order to resist drought, at least three seedlings should be left during the first thinning to prevent death from drought, and then only one seedling should be left during the second thinning.

    After the research, the Technical Committee and the hero Lu Jicai went to each team to lead the study and mobilize hoeing of the cotton. Lu Jicai's group immediately started on the 26th, hoeing ten mu of seedlings in one day. Under his influence, the entire village hoed more than 100 mu of cotton in three days from the 26th to the 28th, and the entire village was able to complete all hoeing by the 29th. (Pan Long)

　　注意抗旱除虫
    车元村精细锄棉
    【本报黎城讯】东元村的花已三寸多高了，绿勃勃的真好看，五月二十五日午，技委会和英雄卢计财集体研究锄棉苗技术，根据今年具体情况，研究出以下办法：（一）用锄把土块拍碎，把地里的裂痕、蚂蚁窝都弄光弄平，一则抗旱，保存水分；再则杀死蚂蚁，防止油旱。（二）浅锄：第一次主要是锄草不宜深。（三）干皮儿锄，俗话说：“湿锄芝麻干锄花”，于每场雨后锄一次，但要地皮干了锄，湿锄了苗叶儿要“圪抓”。（四）为了抗旱，第一次间苗至少要留三棵，防止旱死，等第二次再间全留一棵。
    研究后技委会及英雄卢计财分头到各队领导研究，动员锄棉。二十六日卢计财组即先动手，一天锄苗十亩，在他影响下，全村二十六日到二十八日三天内，共锄棉花一百余亩，全村于二十九日即能全部锄完。（潘龙）
