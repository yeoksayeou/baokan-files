　　Tunliu held a county-wide expanded cadre meeting on May 24th to summarize spring plowing and to arrange drought prevention and seedling tending work. This year's spring plowing achievements and experiences surpassed any previous year. According to statistics: the county organized a total of 12,721 able-bodied laborers, accounting for 74.1 percent of the total able-bodied labor force; 7,510 male semi-able-bodied laborers were organized, accounting for 61 percent of the male semi-able-bodied labor force; 10,189 female able-bodied laborers were organized, accounting for 57.6 percent of the female able-bodied labor force; 5,895 female semi-able-bodied laborers were organized, accounting for 16.5 percent of the female semi-able-bodied labor force; 3,653 children were organized (missing data from districts one and four); 2,937 head of fully capable livestock were organized, accounting for 74.3 percent of the total fully capable livestock; 1,704 head of semi-capable livestock were organized, accounting for 67.9 percent of the semi-capable livestock. In the best villages, such as Luo Village, Ma Village, and Gaotousi, all men, women, livestock, and semi-able-bodied laborers participated in mutual aid at 100 percent. The county's 555,053 mu of autumn land, with an average of 24.2 mu per laborer and 142.4 mu per animal, faced a severe shortage of manpower and animal power. In general, the land was plowed twice, 20 loads of manure were applied, and sowing was done on time. The planting of the three major cash crops – cotton, indigo, and tobacco – was expanded to 10,340 mu, 6,533 mu of fallow land was eliminated (missing data from district six), 702 head of livestock were added, and women, in addition to agricultural mutual aid, completed the task of supporting the front lines by producing 200,000 jin of cotton cloth for military uniforms and 26,000 pairs of military shoes on schedule, creating rich experiences: First, it is necessary to clarify the guiding principles, conduct thorough mobilization, and boldly launch a production merit competition to cultivate a large number of backbones, so that the production movement can develop vigorously. For example, after resolving ideological concerns, district three clearly proposed focusing on spring plowing and production, grasped more than 500 active backbones, and launched a merit competition, which vigorously promoted the movement. Another example is district four, which initially combined re-examining production with actual work, but in reality focused on re-examination, so the production movement did not develop. Later, it held an inspection meeting of more than 300 cadres and model production personnel, and the movement turned around and reached a climax. Second, it is necessary to implement organization, closely combine agriculture with sideline occupations, and cultivate typical examples to promote the general, in order to guide the masses to the road of prosperity and wealth, cultivating three years' worth of food with one year of surplus. For example, district two is the most developed area for handicrafts and sideline production in the county, and the masses have a strong tendency to value sideline occupations over agriculture. The leadership proposed the slogan of organizing agricultural and sideline occupations together to achieve dual prosperity, and focused on the model of Gao Yunting, who transformed from a liberated hero into a production hero, as well as Li Zaiyou, Dong Fengkui, and Li Sisheng. In the industrial and mining area, mainly Wangjiazhuang in Guguan, they created the experience of combining work and agriculture, organizing mutual aid between workers and farmers, and engaging in both farming and working. In the mat-making area, mainly Shishi Village, they created a model where elderly people and children made mats, while young and middle-aged people worked in the fields, achieving mutual assistance in mat-making and farming. In the textile area, mainly Wang Village, they created mutual aid in labor and mutual aid in going to market, saving nearly 20 man-days a day, and jointly bought livestock to transport and earn money after planting, buying cotton ginning bows. The western half of districts one and three emphasized accounting and planning, adhering to the principle of prioritizing agriculture and appropriately developing sideline occupations, which increased the income of the masses. For example, the county's pig raising has developed to 6,988 pigs, an average of one pig per ten households; chicken raising has developed to 65,564 chickens, an average of two chickens per household. Third, it is necessary to solve the problem of combining participation in the war and preferential treatment for military families with production, so that the production movement can develop smoothly and support for the front lines can be guaranteed. At the beginning of this year, the leadership conducted a typical inspection, studied and developed specific measures for participating in the war, performing corvée labor, and farming on behalf of others, rectified corvée labor, and gave full play to the creativity of the masses. For example, Tali Village cleared old corvée accounts, corrected the situation where cadres and activists did not perform corvée labor, expanding the number of people performing corvée labor from 71 to 209, and the whole village immediately bought 17 more livestock. Before the rectification in Yuwu, only 167 able-bodied laborers and 48 semi-able-bodied laborers performed corvée labor. After the rectification, they invited out the overlooked semi-farmers and semi-merchants and a large number of unregistered semi-able-bodied laborers, expanding the scope of corvée labor. Villages such as Luo Village, Qu Village, Hejialing, and Shijiaogou created a method of combining production and participation in the war without hindering either, using corvée tickets to settle accounts on schedule, compensating for the shortfalls. In farming on behalf of others, the general practice was for military families to report themselves, and everyone would evaluate and divide them into types, implementing a contracting system for labor and land, responsible for the whole year. Lu Village used the fruits of struggle that had not been distributed to help military families lacking labor to buy 17 livestock, completely solving the problem of animal power, and organized military families to participate in mutual aid, saving manpower for farming on behalf of others.
    Finally, the meeting determined that the guiding principle for the whole year was that war comes first, everything must be subordinate to war, and everything is for the victory of war; with the production movement as the center, combine the solution of the remaining problems in the land reform in the production movement. The current task is to consolidate, expand, improve, and develop mutual aid teams, especially emphasizing the organization of semi-able-bodied labor, launching a blitz to weed seedlings, prevent drought, prepare for famine, prepare for participation in the war, and further solve the problem of farming on behalf of others. In labor mutual aid, the general areas need to consolidate and expand, and constantly check and solve the four major problems of voluntariness, equal exchange, settlement of accounts with labor tickets, and leadership backbone. The old areas mainly need to improve and greatly develop small-scale agricultural and sideline mutual aid cooperatives. A few villages need to be reorganized, but regardless of new or old areas, in order to support the war of self-defense, it is necessary to strengthen the organization of children and women's semi-able-bodied labor, and implement the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. In weeding seedlings, the county requires hemp and indigo to be weeded three times, cotton five times, and beans and yams twice, and to complete it ahead of schedule.
    In drought prevention and famine preparation, a general mobilization should be launched to overcome the concerns existing among cadres and the masses, break the idea of "relying on heaven for food," establish the idea that "human determination will conquer nature," that is, organize the digging of canals and wells, carry out saving of the people's labor, eliminate waste, and collect substitute foods. According to the above guiding principles and tasks, each district has formulated new plans.

　　屯留总结春耕加紧防旱
    组织起来五十五万余亩秋地下种人定胜天立即开渠打井节约备荒
    【本报太岳十五日电】屯留于五月廿四日召开全县各系统扩干会，总结春耕并布置防旱、锄苗工作。今年全县春耕的成绩与经验超过以往任何一年。据统计：全县组织起来的全劳力共一万二千七百二十一人，占全劳力的百分之七十四·一；男半劳力组织起七千五百一十人，占男半劳力的百分之六十一；妇女全劳力组织起一万零一百八十九人，占妇女全劳力的百分之五十七·六；妇女半劳力组织起五千八百九十五人，占妇女半劳力的百分之十六·五；儿童组织起三千六百五十三人（缺一、四区）；牲口全畜力组织起二千九百三十七头，占全畜力的百分之七十四·三；半畜力组织起一千七百零四头，占半畜力的百分之六十七·九。最好的如罗村、马庄、高头寺等村，男女人畜全半劳力都百分之百的参加了互助。全县五十五万五千零五十三亩秋地，在每个劳力平均二十四亩二分，每犋牲口平均一百四十二亩四分的人畜力严重缺乏情况下，一般的做到了犁二遍，上粪二十担，并作到了按时播种，推广了棉、蓝，烟叶三大经济作物一万零三百四十亩，消灭了熟荒六千五百三十三亩（缺六区），增添牲口七百零二头，妇女们除农业互助外，并按期完成了二十万斤棉花的军布，及二万六千双军鞋的支前任务，创造了很丰富的经验：一、必须明确方针，深入动员，大胆放手开展生产立功竞赛，培养大批骨干，生产运动才会蓬勃开展。如三区于解决思想顾虑后，明确提出以春耕生产为中心，掌握了五百多个积极骨干，掀起了立功竞赛，运动便猛烈的开展起来。再如四区开始以复查生产结合，但实际是复查为中心，生产运动就没开展，以后抓紧召开了一个三百余人的干部模范生产人员检查大会，运动才扭过来，走向高潮。二、必须贯彻组织起来，农业为主与副业密切结合，培养典型推动一般，才能引导群众走向发财致富耕三余一的道路。如二区是全县手工业、副业生产最发达的地区，群众重副轻农思想很浓厚，领导上提出了组织起来农副业结合，双料发财的口号，并抓紧了由翻身英雄变生产英雄的高云亭及李再有、董凤奎、李思圣等模范，在工矿区以故县王家庄为主，创造做工农业结合经验，组织工农互助，半农半工两面赶。在打席区以石室村为主，创造出老汉、儿童打席，青壮年上地，作到打席种地互助。在纺织区以王庄为主，创造出互助劳动互助赶集，一天节省人工近廿个，并伙买牲口，种完地运输赚钱买弹花弓。运输区以东兴庄为主，创造出运输与农业结合的范例。一、三区的西半区则是强调了算账订计划。以农为主并适当发展副业的方针，增大了群众收入。如全县养猪已发展到六千九百八十八只，平均十户一只；鸡发展了六万五千五百六十四只，平均一户二只。三、必须解决参战优军与生产结合的问题，生产运动才能顺利发展，支援前线才有保证。今年一开春，领导上作了典型检查，研究出参战、支差并代耕的具体办法，整顿了差务，发挥了群众的创造，如他里村清理了旧差账，纠正了干部积极分子不支差，使七十一人的支差的扩大为二百零九人，马上全村增买了十七头牲口。余吾在整顿前，支差的全劳力仅一百六十七人，半劳力四十八人，整顿后把遗漏的半农半商及大批没登记过的半劳力都请出来，扩大了差务面。罗村、曲庄、贺家岭、史家沟等村，创造出生产与参战结合两不误的办法，使用差票按期算账，长得短补。在代耕上一般都采用了军属自报，大家评议划分类型实行包工包地，全年负责办法。路村是把未分的斗争果实帮助缺劳力军属买了十七个牲口，彻底解决了畜力问题，并组织军属参加互助，节省代耕人力。
    最后会上确定全年方针为战争第一，一切服从战争，一切为了战争的胜利；以生产运动为中心，在生产运动中结合解决土改中的遗留问题，当前的任务是巩固扩大提高发展互助组，特别是强调了半劳力的组织，突击锄苗防旱备荒，准备参战，进一步解决代耕。在劳动互助上，一般地区都是巩固扩大的问题，要时时检查解决自愿自由，等价交换，用工票清算账，领导骨干等四大问题，老区主要是提高，大大发展小型的农副业互助合作社，有少数村庄，则须重新整顿，但不管新区老区，为了支援自卫战争，都必须加强儿童、妇女半劳力的组织，贯彻农副业结合。在锄苗上，全县要求麻、蓝锄三遍，棉花五遍，豆子、山药锄两遍，并提前完成。
    在防旱备荒上，展开普遍动员，克服干部与群众中存在着的顾虑心理，打破“靠天吃饭”思想，树立“人定胜天”思想，即组织开渠、打井，开展节省民力，杜绝浪费，采集代食品。根据以上的方针任务，各区都订出新计划。
