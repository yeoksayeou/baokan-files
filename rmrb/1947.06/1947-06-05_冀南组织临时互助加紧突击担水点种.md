　　【This newspaper, Jinan, 3rd dispatch】In Jinan, people everywhere are organizing temporary mutual aid to rush planting. In the Qi Zhi Fourth District, 62 young and middle-aged people in Daicun village, after a day of rushing to help military families plant 15 mu of cotton and 3 mu of melons, all the young, middle-aged, elderly, and semi-able-bodied people in the village were organized. They voluntarily formed four temporary mutual aid groups, with five to seven people in each group. The young and middle-aged carried water, the elderly dug pits, and women and children planted seeds. Under the slogan of "No one is idle, no well is idle," they rushed to plant more than 250 mu of cotton and 30 mu of north melon in five days, and continued to plant sorghum. The masses of Dongzizhuang Village in Zhentang County voluntarily combined to form 17 mutual aid groups. Many representatives who had turned themselves around were elected by the masses as group leaders, and 32 households of orphans and widows with no labor force were also organized into various groups to exchange work with men by spinning, weaving, and sewing clothes. Seventy full laborers and forty semi-laborers rushed to plant, and the basic sowing of 1,423 mu of dry land was completed. The masses of Datianzhuang Village in Gaotang First District mobilized all the men, women, old, and young in the village, divided them into temporary mutual aid groups, and carried water to rush planting under the leadership of the village cadres. The mood was extremely high. They planted 14 mu in one day, and everyone returned to the village and said in a competitive tone: "Tomorrow must exceed half of today." Wei Xuelin of Hou Youfang in Guguan Fifth District, seeing that there was no rain due to the drought, promoted everywhere: "Oppose relying on heaven for food." He and his wife and children carried water to plant cotton, planting two mu in three days. He promoted to everyone that as long as they are willing to work hard, the land will not be barren, and waiting for rain will only lead to starvation.

　　冀南组织临时互助加紧突击担水点种
    【本报冀南三日电】冀南各地群众组织临时互助抢种。企之四区打町村青壮年六十二人，经一天突击、帮军属点完十五亩棉花、三亩瓜后，全村青壮及老弱半劳力统统组织起来，自愿结合组成四个临时互助组，每组五人、七人不等，青壮年担水、老年掘坑、妇女儿童下种，在“不闲一个人，不闲一眼井。”的口号下，五天抢点棉花二百五十余亩、北瓜三十亩，并继续点高粱。振堂县东子庄群众自愿结合组织了十七个互助组，不少领导翻身的代表被群众选为组长，三十二户没劳力的孤寡也都分别组织到各组去，以纺线、织布、缝衣服，和男人变工。七十个全劳力、四十个半劳力突击枪种，一千四百二十三亩旱苗地基本上完成播种。高唐一区大田庄群众全村男女老少总动员，划分了临时互助小组，在村干带头下担水突击点种，情绪异常高涨，一天种了十四亩，大家回村带着竞赛的口气说：“明天一定要超过今天的一半。”故城五区后油坊魏学林见天旱不下雨，到处宣传：“反对靠天吃饭”，他和老婆小孩担水点棉，三天种了二亩。他见人就宣传，只要肯出力就荒不了地，等雨只有活活饿死。
