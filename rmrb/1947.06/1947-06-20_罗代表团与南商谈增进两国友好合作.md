Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Comprehensive Report: As new democratic countries in the Balkans intensify their unity, the Romanian government delegation visited Yugoslavia and held talks with Yugoslav representatives, achieving significant progress in enhancing friendly relations between the two countries and establishing closer political, economic, and cultural cooperation. The Romanian government delegation was led by Prime Minister Groza, and included Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tatarescu, Minister of Education Fotec, Minister of Industry and Trade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, and Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, Bodnăraș. The Romanian delegation arrived in Yugoslavia on the 7th and returned home on the 11th. Upon arrival in Belgrade, the delegation was warmly welcomed by Marshal Tito and Yugoslav government officials. Marshal Tito, in his speech at a grand reception, stated: "Strengthening relations between Romania and Yugoslavia will be conducive to the consolidation of peace." Groza, in his reply, emphasized: "In the post-war era, imperialist tendencies have not disappeared in this part of Europe, but we believe that through the cooperation of peace-loving forces, this trend can be stopped." After three days of discussions, the representatives of the two countries issued a communiqué announcing that the two countries had agreed on a cultural agreement, which will be signed in Bucharest in the near future. In order to establish larger-scale economic cooperation, a committee will be formed to formulate an action program to accomplish this goal. The two countries have also formulated a common course of action regarding the protection of the sovereignty and rights of Danube countries at the future international Danube conference. The communiqué also stated that the two governments also discussed the early conclusion of a treaty of friendship.

Romanian and Yugoslav newspapers attached great importance to the visit of the Romanian delegation to Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav newspaper Borba stated: "The strengthening of friendly relations between the two peoples plays an important role in the efforts of the Balkan democratic countries to establish lasting peace in this part of Europe." The Romanian newspaper Scînteia stated: "The Romanian people firmly believe that the progress of the Balkan people and the independence of their countries can only be strengthened in this way."
