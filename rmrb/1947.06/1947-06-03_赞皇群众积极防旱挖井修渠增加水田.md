　　Zanhuang Masses Actively Prevent Drought by Digging Wells, Repairing Canals, and Increasing Paddy Fields
    [Report from Zanhuang by Our Newspaper] After the production mobilization meetings in each district in mid-May, the masses in villages throughout the county actively dug wells and repaired canals. After half a month of effort, nearly a thousand mu of dry land will soon be transformed into paddy fields. In the Yangze, Nan, and Bei Pingwang villages of the Second District, three canals were opened, turning more than 470 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The Hedong Canal, once repaired, can irrigate more than 20 mu of land. In Dong Yangze and Hedong villages, there are still two canals under construction, which can increase the irrigated area by more than 40 mu. In Wuchang Village of the First District, 270 to 280 mu have been planted by carrying water, and five wells have been dug. In the Fifth District, the construction of a large canal in Nanqinghe has also begun. After this canal is repaired, 300 mu of dry land can be turned into paddy fields. In Bailu Village of the Fourth District, two wells were dug, and a canal was opened between the village and Zhushan Village, starting construction on the 21st. Under the leadership of cadres and the active participation of the masses, it was estimated that 850 workdays would be required for a large bridge, but only over 630 workdays were used. It is expected to be completed by the 27th, and 150 mu of land can be irrigated. In less than ten days, the whole county has dug seven wells and opened four canals, turning more than 500 mu of dry land into fertile fields, and has begun to irrigate and plant. There are still four canals under construction, which will be completed soon, adding another 490 mu of irrigated land. In Baicaoping Village of the Third District, in order to save water and irrigate more land, it was discussed and decided that mutual aid teams would assign fixed personnel to irrigate uniformly, overcoming the problem of whoever irrigates, irrigates more of their own land. In previous years, they couldn't even get water twice, but this year they have irrigated three times. (Zeng Liang)

　　赞皇群众积极防旱挖井修渠增加水田
    【本报赞皇讯】五月中旬各区生产动员会后，全县各村群众纷纷挖井修渠，经半月努力，即将有千亩旱地变为水田。二区阳泽、南、北平旺，三村开渠三道，四百七十余亩旱地变为水田。河东修好一道渠能浇地二十余亩。东阳泽、河东每村还有两道正在开修，可增浇地四十余亩。一区武昌村已担水点种二百七、八十亩，并挖井五眼。五区南清河一条大渠也开始动工，这条渠修好后，三百亩旱地能成水地。四区白路村挖井两眼，并与竹山在两村之间开渠一道，于廿一日动工，在干部领导群众积极参加下，一座大桥预计用工八百五十个，只四天结果用六百三十多工。至二十七日即可全部完竣，可浇地一百五十亩。全县在不到十天当中，共凿井七眼，开渠四道，五百余亩旱地变成良田，开始浇水下种。还有四道正在赶修，不日即竣工，又可增加四百九十余亩浇地。三区白草坪村为节省水利多浇地，讨论规定由互助组固定人统一浇，克服谁浇谁地多灌水的毛病，往年两次还浇不上，今年浇了三次。（增亮）
