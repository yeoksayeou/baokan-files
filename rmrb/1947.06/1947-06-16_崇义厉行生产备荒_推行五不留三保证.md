　　Chongyi Implements Vigorous Production to Prepare for Famine:
    Promoting the "Five No's and Three Guarantees"
    [Our Wu'an News] A few days ago, the Eighth District held a mobilization meeting of 1,000 cadres and activists, calling for production, thrift, drought prevention, and famine preparedness. Fifty people from Chongyi Village participated. After returning to the village, based on the district's call, they further mobilized the masses to produce, economize, and prepare to overcome the famine. Liu Qiaoyun, a liberated woman (deputy director of the Women's Association), first calculated her family's time and checked the granary. She estimated that through a year of production and thrift, she could save two to three *shi* of grain and sell fabric for 4,500 yuan, saving 4,000 yuan. Last year, she received five *dou* of wheat as fruit distribution. After eating some during the New Year and holidays, she still has more than two *dou* left. The wheat in the field yielded six *dou*, which she also intends to save. The next day, she mobilized the women to calculate accounts and make plans together. Jin Erhui of Second Street originally lacked more than 30,000 yuan and had no way to cover expenses. After planning for thrift, she increased her confidence and would not only avoid being short but also have a surplus of 10,000 yuan. Jin Gengyuan of First Street roughly calculated a shortage of 31,000 yuan. After a detailed calculation, economizing on pocket money alone would be enough to make up the difference. Jin Xianhui said after calculating the accounts: "We rely on thrift to get through the hard times." She planned to persuade her son to quit smoking cigarettes, which would allow him to cultivate one-third more land per year. Political Director Jin Gaiyuan also said after calculating the accounts: "Smoking is a big loophole. As long as we can switch to smoking homegrown tobacco, the grain saved will last a long time." A village-wide accounting movement automatically unfolded. Winter Joy, Zi Shi, and ten other activists who attended the district meeting convinced more than 20 households and calculated production and thrift accounts in one day. On the evening of the 21st, the mass accounting movement reached a preliminary stage. The leadership, based on the masses' sentiments and organizational situation, proposed five "no's" and three "guarantees" for the whole village's production and thrift: (1) No fallow land left uncultivated, no wasteland left untouched, no manure piles left unattended, no weeds left on the edges of fields, and no idle or lazy people left unoccupied. (2) Guarantee that on thrift, each person saves one *liang* of millet per day, with 2,000 people in the village saving 2,000 *liang* per day, totaling 45,000 *jin* per year. On clothing, each person has one new and one old outfit, guaranteeing the saving of one piece of clothing and two pairs of shoes and socks. Reduce coal burning by four months per year, reduce salt consumption by two *liang* per person per month, eat more coarse salt, and save on oil by using less light. The cooperative will stop selling cigarettes, reduce all pocket money, saving an average of 500 yuan per person per day, totaling 12 million yuan for the whole village per year, ensuring production capital. In terms of implementation: The men have now finished harvesting wheat and are beginning to hoe cotton, cultivating on time. The women are in charge of thrift, going to the fields when necessary, and keeping the spinning wheels busy when not in the fields.

　　崇义厉行生产备荒
    推行五不留三保证
    【本报武安讯】八区前几天召开了一个干部积极分子千人动员大会，号召生产节约防旱备荒。崇义村有五十个人参加，回村后就根据区上号召，进一步发动群众生产节约准备渡荒。翻身妇女刘巧云（妇会副主任），自己回来就先把家里时光合算了一下，看看囤里，一年生产节约可存下粮食两三石，卖布四千五百元，也存下了四千元。去年分了果实麦子五斗，除过年过节吃了点外，也还保存有二斗多，地里麦子又打下六斗，也都要节省下来。第二天就动员妇女大家算账订计划，二街靳二会自己原来短少三万多块钱，没法开支，经计划节约后，提高了信心，不但不短，还有一万元长余。一街靳更元算粗账短少三万一千元，细算后光节约零用就能补够。靳先会算账后说：“过时光凭俭省哩。”计划动员儿子戒了纸烟，一年还能耕三余一哩。政治主任靳改元算账后也说：“吸烟是个大漏洞，只要能换成旱烟省下的粮食就能吃很久。”全村性的算账运动就自动的展开了，参加区上开会回来的积极分子冬喜、子时等十个人，一天就打通了二十多户群众思想，算了生产节约账。二十一日晚上，群众算账运动酝酿告一段落，领导上又根据群众情绪及组织情况，提出全村生产节约五个不留三个保证：（一）一亩茬地不留，一亩荒地不留，一个粪堆不留，地边地沿荒草不留，一个闲人懒汉不留。（二）节约上保证一人一天节省小米一两，全村两千口人一天节省二千两，一年四万五千斤。穿衣一人一新一旧，保证节省一件衣裳，鞋袜两双。烧煤一年减少四个月，吃盐一人一月减少二两，多吃小盐，少点灯省油。合作社停止卖纸烟，减少一切零用，每人每日平均省五百元，全村全年一千二百万元，生产资本有了保证。在做法上：男人现在麦收已完，开始锄棉，按时耕作，妇女掌握节约，紧时下地，不下地时纺车不闲。
