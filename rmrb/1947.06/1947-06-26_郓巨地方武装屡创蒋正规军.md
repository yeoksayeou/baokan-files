　　[Reported from Jiluyu on the 22nd] The local armed militia of Yuncheng and Juancheng counties bravely fought against the "Homecoming Corps" who were looting grain and conscripting soldiers, and shattered their "mopping-up" operations. On May 3rd, over a hundred enemies departed west from Yinma, where they were ambushed by our militia at Mazhuang, resulting in three enemy casualties. On the morning of the 4th, over thirty enemies from the "Homecoming Corps" went to Liuhai to loot grain, but were forced to flee after being attacked by the militia, abandoning three carts of grain. On the 6th, an enemy company from Huang'an, combined with the Homecoming Corps, set out to loot grain and conscript soldiers. They were intercepted by our militia and fled to the village of Dayao, where they were ambushed by our county brigade. After an hour of intense fighting, we killed eight enemies. At dawn on the 8th, a unit of the Yuncheng and Juancheng local armed forces launched an attack on Fanzhuang, near Huang'an, eight miles away. An enemy battalion from the 55th Division and the "Homecoming Corps" departed from Huang'an and were ambushed by us, resulting in eight enemy casualties (including one squad leader). After being attacked, the enemy dared not venture out. On the 15th, the enemy's 220th Regiment stationed in Yuncheng and over three hundred armed men from the puppet county set out to sweep through Wangchutiao and its surrounding areas. The local armed forces of Yuncheng and Juancheng bravely launched an attack and engaged the enemy in a bayonet charge at Kuizhuang. After three hours of intense fighting, we killed or wounded 104 enemies, including a battalion commander. That night, the enemy fled back to Yuncheng.
　　[Reported from Jiluyu on the 22nd] (Late arrival) On May 3rd, a unit of our South Juancheng local armed forces fought against Chiang's regular army, which outnumbered us by more than two to one, and achieved a significant victory. An enemy battalion from the 70th Division, in coordination with a local company, set out from Jining City at 4:00 AM on the 3rd, attempting to capture our local troops. We had already moved, taking the initiative. As the enemy moved through the Mamiao area and returned towards the city, we circled around the enemy from the side. Before the enemy could deploy their heavy weapons, our heroic soldiers charged into the village of Lifang, routing the enemy. We pursued them for about half a mile, successfully concluding the battle, resulting in over thirty enemy casualties (rumored by the enemy to include a battalion commander), four captured alive, two rifles seized, over eight hundred rounds of ammunition, fifteen helmets, and other spoils of war. One hundred and sixty-seven captured civilians were liberated.
